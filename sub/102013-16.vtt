Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:10.809 --> 01:12.985
Hey, hey, it was just
a nightmare. It's okay.

01:13.029 --> 01:15.684
You're okay.
You're okay.

01:36.922 --> 01:38.924
You want to talk
about that nightmare?

01:40.448 --> 01:42.754
It's probably just anxiety

01:42.798 --> 01:45.105
over my meeting
with Celia this morning.

01:45.148 --> 01:47.324
We're going over

01:47.368 --> 01:49.370
the guest list for Everett's
Beat the Rap party.

01:49.413 --> 01:51.111
Maybe she wants
to rehearse

01:51.154 --> 01:54.070
how you're going to tell Everett
you're his granddaughter.

01:55.376 --> 01:56.768
Unless you've changed your mind
about that?

01:56.812 --> 01:58.857
[sighs]

01:58.901 --> 02:01.904
Here we go.

02:01.947 --> 02:04.341
So that's still the plan?

02:06.343 --> 02:08.302
You're giving away
entire identity.

02:08.345 --> 02:09.912
No, I'm not.

02:09.955 --> 02:11.870
I'm playing a role.

02:11.914 --> 02:15.178
Nancy Drew will be tucked away
inside of me the whole time.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.267
Don't worry.

02:20.749 --> 02:23.317
NICK:
Well, we tried to link Everett

02:23.360 --> 02:25.841
to extortion and tax evasion,
and we almost had him

02:25.884 --> 02:27.843
on conspiracy to murder
with the Bonny Scot,

02:27.886 --> 02:30.889
but then Nancy put
a stop to that.

02:30.933 --> 02:32.891
Still, we know
he's had people killed.

02:32.935 --> 02:35.372
And my contact at the company,
Howard the accountant--

02:35.416 --> 02:37.374
he's supposed to
be meeting us.

02:37.418 --> 02:39.071
He sent me an
encrypted text saying

02:39.115 --> 02:41.857
there's something called
"the Black Crown tape"

02:41.900 --> 02:44.816
that shows Everett
committing a murder himself.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.905
RYAN:
Yeah, and this-this could be

02:46.949 --> 02:49.212
the straw that takes down
the whole house of dominos.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.606
Okay, mixed metaphors aside,

02:51.649 --> 02:53.956
don't you think something smells
a little fishy here?

02:53.999 --> 02:56.306
Your contact is over
a half an hour late.

02:56.350 --> 02:58.874
And why would someone
keep a murder tape?

02:58.917 --> 03:00.658
Well, if it exists,
I can think of a few reasons

03:00.702 --> 03:02.660
someone might keep
something like that around.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.314
Most of them nasty.

03:04.358 --> 03:06.969
Maybe we should go
by Howard's hotel.

03:07.012 --> 03:08.536
He's staying
at the Breaker.

03:08.579 --> 03:11.669
Okay.
Thank you.

Cute.

03:23.203 --> 03:27.294
I'm really... gonna need
some more feedback here, guys.

03:27.337 --> 03:28.860
Unless she wants me
to keep pining

03:28.904 --> 03:31.254
for the ghost
that lives inside her.

03:31.298 --> 03:33.735
She doesn't. She has enough
on her plate already,

03:33.778 --> 03:35.954
what with the dire warning
she got from Aunt Mei.

03:35.998 --> 03:37.391
What dire warning?

Everett.

04:05.506 --> 04:07.551
Good morning.

04:07.595 --> 04:10.293
I saw your name
on my wife's schedule, so

04:10.337 --> 04:12.469
I'm taking the opportunity
to speak with you.

04:12.513 --> 04:14.036
Is Celia running late?

04:14.079 --> 04:16.299
Mm. I wouldn't expect my wife

04:16.343 --> 04:18.519
to keep track of time today.

04:18.562 --> 04:21.565
She gets this way when she's
planning one of her parties.

04:21.609 --> 04:23.567
All obligations
go out the window

04:23.611 --> 04:25.874
when table settings
are on the line.

04:25.917 --> 04:29.704
Well, I should go find her then.

04:29.747 --> 04:31.793
I have a job for you.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.803
Celia is convinced
that your...

04:41.846 --> 04:45.763
skills as an investigator
could be an asset to our family.

04:45.807 --> 04:50.028
After your performance with the
D.A. recanting your testimony,

04:50.072 --> 04:52.074
I'm willing
to give you another chance

04:52.117 --> 04:53.989
to demonstrate your loyalty.

04:54.032 --> 04:55.817
You mean you want to test me.

04:56.818 --> 04:59.168
What's the job?

05:01.083 --> 05:03.215
While I was under indictment,

05:03.259 --> 05:06.480
several of my accounts
were frozen.

05:06.523 --> 05:08.786
Hmm.I've been forced
to clean up

05:08.830 --> 05:11.441
some messes that never
should have been made.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.704
And that has revealed
some issues

05:13.748 --> 05:16.141
with one
of my favorite accountants.

05:16.185 --> 05:18.318
What's the problem?

05:18.361 --> 05:20.624
Numbers not adding up, or...?

05:20.668 --> 05:24.106
Howard has been less
than careful

05:24.149 --> 05:26.630
with confidential
corporate information.

05:26.674 --> 05:29.981
Someone got
in his head,

05:30.025 --> 05:33.637
convinced him to start
telling tales out of school.

05:33.681 --> 05:37.206
Howard wouldn't confess to it
when I fired him yesterday,

05:37.249 --> 05:40.252
but I need to know
who has been talking to him,

05:40.296 --> 05:42.603
and who else, in turn,

05:42.646 --> 05:46.389
Howard has been
leaking lies to.

05:46.433 --> 05:49.958
Lies about me and my company.

05:50.001 --> 05:51.960
Why are you asking me?

05:52.003 --> 05:53.788
Don't you have people
for this kind of thing?

05:53.831 --> 05:56.094
Since Howard was compromised,

05:56.138 --> 05:59.446
I no longer know who I can trust
among my other employees.

06:04.799 --> 06:10.152

computer confiscated.

Mm. That's it? You're just
gonna ask for, like, a favor?

06:51.541 --> 06:54.675

that the bribe was implied.

could have slipped out.

think someone

and just fake his suicide?

there's a piece of information

He fired Howard
for sharing it,

This isn't you. Who is this?I-I don't know.

Hey, Ace.

11:31.821 --> 11:34.824
So, I've got a guy
over at the Seabury Prison

11:34.868 --> 11:37.087
who confirmed
that Howard was there yesterday

11:37.131 --> 11:38.959
visiting an inmate.

11:39.002 --> 11:40.874
What does that mean,
you got a guy?

11:40.917 --> 11:42.745
I got a guy. Okay?

11:42.789 --> 11:44.921
That's for your girlfriend.
She's been helping us out.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.662
Maybe she can
keep helping us out.

11:48.446 --> 11:50.057
Look, if this inmate

11:50.100 --> 11:52.320
pointed Howard
to the murder tape,

11:52.363 --> 11:55.236
then we need to pay
this inmate a visit.

Who's the inmate?

11:57.281 --> 11:58.718

12:11.948 --> 12:13.602
like this.
I regret every one I opened.

12:13.645 --> 12:16.170
Everett asked for my
help with a mission.

12:16.213 --> 12:19.608
Part olive branch,
part loyalty test.

12:22.437 --> 12:23.786
You were the one that said,

12:23.830 --> 12:25.179
"Do whatever it takes
to stay alive."

12:25.222 --> 12:27.311
Before you recanted
your testimony.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.400
Before he asked you
for whatever this is.

12:29.444 --> 12:31.272
Another piece of your soul?

12:32.316 --> 12:35.450
NANCY:
Howard Driscoll's ID
and passwords.

12:35.493 --> 12:37.582
Aah.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.500
[exhales]

12:42.544 --> 12:44.807
You're just being dramatic.

12:44.851 --> 12:47.375
I'm just being protective.

12:47.418 --> 12:50.160
[computer chimes]

12:50.204 --> 12:53.207
You know, it was Kate who
pulled me away from the Hudsons

12:53.250 --> 12:54.817
after you were born.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.037
She saw what they were
pushing me to become,

12:57.080 --> 13:00.562
so she said, "Let's pack
our bags and go to Europe."

13:00.605 --> 13:03.130
Running away didn't really fix
your problems, did it?

13:04.784 --> 13:07.699
What if you talked to the D.A.
about turning state's evidence?

13:07.743 --> 13:10.877
Are you suggesting
I go into witness protection?

13:10.920 --> 13:13.183
That's your plan B?

13:13.227 --> 13:15.882
There's...[sighs]

13:15.925 --> 13:17.144
[computer chimes]

13:17.187 --> 13:19.537
I can see
why Everett wanted help.

13:19.581 --> 13:21.713
What kind of email address
even is this?

13:21.757 --> 13:23.759
That's an inmate address.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.762
I use the same connection
service at Seabury Prison.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.765
Whose laptop is this?Everett's
favorite accountant.

13:29.809 --> 13:30.984
Who's been leaking information
to Nick.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.333
And I would ask Nick about it,

13:32.376 --> 13:34.030
but I think
he's been lying to me.

13:35.075 --> 13:37.512
So, Howard was talking
to someone in the prison, too.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.470
Someone who sent some emails
last week.

13:39.514 --> 13:40.863
Something
about missing payments.

13:40.907 --> 13:43.300
[sighs]Maybe Howard knows what

13:43.344 --> 13:46.608
the payments are for.Okay, undoubtedly something
that you should stay away from.

13:46.651 --> 13:50.003
Please, stop before engaging
with Everett any further.

13:50.046 --> 13:53.397
Not while Nick and Ryan
are still out there unprotected.

13:55.965 --> 13:58.185
I'll tell you what. I...

13:58.228 --> 14:00.883
I'll hold off
on answering Everett, okay?

14:00.927 --> 14:03.581
Okay.Running late anyway.

14:03.625 --> 14:06.671
I promised Celia that I would
meet her at the flower shop.

14:12.808 --> 14:15.724
I knew you were
hiding something.

14:15.767 --> 14:17.726
Why are you shutting me out?NICK: We're looking
out for you, Nancy.

14:17.769 --> 14:19.206
Lives are on the line,

14:19.249 --> 14:22.078
and you are overleveraged
with too many loyalties.

14:22.122 --> 14:24.211
I took this case
to look out for all of us.

14:24.254 --> 14:26.126
He's dead, Nancy.

14:26.169 --> 14:28.650
Howard is dead.

14:28.693 --> 14:31.087
NICK:
We found him in his hotel room.

14:31.131 --> 14:34.177
Cops are there now, and it looks
like a very convenient suicide.

14:34.221 --> 14:35.483
NANCY:
If Everett is closing the loop

14:35.526 --> 14:37.354
on people that he can't trust,

14:37.398 --> 14:40.270
you two could be next.Everett is
a lot less worried

14:40.314 --> 14:41.793
about what Howard told us

14:41.837 --> 14:43.491
than what his prisoner
friend told Howard.

14:43.534 --> 14:44.927
[lock buzzes]Bertram Bobbsey.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.755
Former Hudson groundskeeper.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.452
I ID'd him

14:48.496 --> 14:50.846
through his pay history,
which predates incarceration.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.110
We're after
the same information.

14:54.154 --> 14:55.764
We can work together.

14:58.027 --> 15:01.857
Okay. Well, I-I called ahead
to talk to Mr. Bobbsey.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.033
NICK:
You won't be able to get in. Uh,

15:04.077 --> 15:06.949
his visiting hour's been booked
by a family member.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.864
We're out here waiting

15:08.908 --> 15:10.387
for Amanda Bobbsey.

15:10.431 --> 15:12.955
She's already inside
with her dad.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.261
Hmm.

15:14.304 --> 15:15.871
And I think it's best
if you just

15:15.915 --> 15:17.960
step back from this one.

15:18.004 --> 15:20.615
You don't know me at all,
do you?

15:28.971 --> 15:30.973
[lock buzzes][footsteps approaching]

15:31.017 --> 15:33.149
Hi, Dad.

15:35.543 --> 15:37.632
Well, this is very irregular.

15:37.675 --> 15:40.156
Who's this boy
who is not your brother?

15:40.200 --> 15:42.724
Uh, mm, this-this is Ace.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.160
Good to meet you, sir.

15:44.204 --> 15:46.162
You, too.

15:46.206 --> 15:48.686
She never lets me meet
her boyfriends.

15:48.730 --> 15:50.688
This must be important.

15:50.732 --> 15:54.040
Uh, Dad, you had
a visitor recently.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.824
Yeah.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.957
Also not your brother.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.046
He's stubborn like that.BERTRAM:
I bet you

16:00.089 --> 16:02.004
can get through to him, though.AMANDA:
Okay, fine.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.788
If I bring him with
me next Sunday,

16:03.832 --> 16:06.356
will you answer some questions
about your other visitor?

16:06.400 --> 16:09.055
Aw, anything for you,
Panda Bear.

16:09.098 --> 16:11.013
[lock buzzes]

16:11.057 --> 16:12.580
RAY:
I know I owe you a favor

16:12.623 --> 16:14.495
from that thing with my niece
at the ski jump,

16:14.538 --> 16:16.497
but there's nothing I can do.

16:16.540 --> 16:19.152
There's limits on visitations.Okay.

16:19.195 --> 16:22.894
Can you tell me about this man
that was here yesterday?

16:22.938 --> 16:26.376
Glasses,
tie with a big knot.

16:26.420 --> 16:27.899
Name's Howard Driscoll?

16:27.943 --> 16:29.379
RAY:
Yeah, I checked him in.

16:29.423 --> 16:31.338
I thought he was a lawyer.

16:31.381 --> 16:33.818
He got pissy when I said
he couldn't take his pen

16:33.862 --> 16:35.342
and pad in.
That's the rules.

16:35.385 --> 16:36.908
Got it.

16:36.952 --> 16:38.606
Yeah, some people
like to take longhand notes.

16:38.649 --> 16:40.303
Thank you.

16:44.873 --> 16:46.918
Seems like it'd be easier to
talk to Howard yourself, though.

16:46.962 --> 16:49.617
Right? Instead of coming
out here to see me?He told our friends

16:49.660 --> 16:52.228
about a tape.

16:52.272 --> 16:54.578
Did he learn about it from you?

16:56.580 --> 16:58.321
The Black Crown tape.

16:58.365 --> 17:00.323
Yeah.Yeah,

17:00.367 --> 17:02.021
I told him
where it was locked up.

17:02.064 --> 17:03.761
I thought
it'd kick the gears into place

17:03.805 --> 17:05.372
and get my canteen money
flowing again.

17:09.376 --> 17:11.378
Wait.

17:11.421 --> 17:14.033
He didn't try to get
in the hiding place, did he?

17:14.076 --> 17:16.078
What would happen if he did?

17:16.122 --> 17:18.689
It might defy nature.

17:18.733 --> 17:21.779
Like a flower that grows
in total darkness.

17:21.823 --> 17:23.390
You see,

17:23.433 --> 17:25.435
the help sees more
than you think they do.

17:26.828 --> 17:29.570
I saw Everett Hudson
burn that tape.

17:29.613 --> 17:32.007
I saw him smash it into pieces.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.923
I saw him throw it in the bay.
But no matter what he did,

17:34.966 --> 17:37.143
that tape just
kept coming back.

17:37.186 --> 17:41.625
It'd show up on his doorstep
in perfect condition every time.

17:41.669 --> 17:45.020
If that's not a haunting,
I don't know what is.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.284
And if you can't destroy
something like that,

17:48.328 --> 17:51.026
you better hide it.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.463
ACE:
So, before this, Everett

17:53.507 --> 17:56.858
had you on payroll
to keep you quiet?

17:56.901 --> 18:00.601
Because you know where
the bodies are buried?

18:00.644 --> 18:03.647
Panda Bear, everybody knows
where the bodies are buried.

18:03.691 --> 18:06.041
But why are you asking me?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.043
Hmm?

18:08.087 --> 18:10.785
If Howard told your friends,
then why can't he tell you?

18:10.828 --> 18:12.439
H-He's dead.

18:13.440 --> 18:16.269
It happened this morning.

18:16.312 --> 18:17.748
Guard!

18:18.749 --> 18:20.099
You need to forget

18:20.142 --> 18:22.101
you heard anything about this.

18:22.144 --> 18:24.364
The only reason I told Howard
about that tape

18:24.407 --> 18:25.800
was to get him
to start paying me again.

18:25.843 --> 18:27.584
He shouldn't have looked
any farther,

18:27.628 --> 18:29.630
and neither should you.Mr. Bobbsey,

18:29.673 --> 18:31.110
if the tape
is worth killing for,

18:31.153 --> 18:32.633
you could be next. We...Guard,

18:32.676 --> 18:33.938
we're done here!

18:33.982 --> 18:35.505
[lock clicks]

18:35.549 --> 18:37.420
Dad, just tell us
where Everett hid

18:37.464 --> 18:40.075
the tape.You know too much already.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.685
Dad...

18:43.165 --> 18:45.602
[lock beeps, clicks]What do you know?

18:48.257 --> 18:50.912
AMANDA: What I know about my dad
is he loves to collect keys.

18:50.955 --> 18:54.133
NICK:
And by that, you mean
your father steals keys.

18:54.176 --> 18:55.482
He holds on to them.

18:55.525 --> 18:57.527
Just in case.

18:57.571 --> 19:00.313
Okay. There is a lock
that needs opening.

19:00.356 --> 19:02.315
"Try to get in the place,"
he said.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.752
The videotape is locked up.AMANDA:Right.

19:04.795 --> 19:07.755
And for every lock,
there's a key.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.191
What did he do
for your family?

19:09.235 --> 19:11.759
Well, he looked after
the grounds at the lodge.

19:11.802 --> 19:13.848
Made an okay garden trellis,
too, I guess.

19:13.891 --> 19:16.111
Thanks?RYAN:
Wait.

19:17.591 --> 19:19.984
I think this went
to my high school Porsche.ACE: Do you recognize

19:20.028 --> 19:21.247
any others?

19:21.290 --> 19:23.336
[phone buzzing]

19:24.293 --> 19:25.903
It's Nancy.

19:25.947 --> 19:27.427
Hey.

19:27.470 --> 19:28.906
So, what was
in Howard's notebook?

19:28.950 --> 19:30.256
He didn't turn it over.

19:30.299 --> 19:31.648
It's property
of Hudson Enterprises.

19:31.692 --> 19:33.128
Um, uh, wh-what notebook?

19:33.172 --> 19:35.043
The GPS on Howard's phone

19:35.086 --> 19:37.219
says that he only drove

19:37.263 --> 19:39.700
to the prison and his hotel.

19:39.743 --> 19:42.964
If I find out that you removed
the notebook from his room

19:43.007 --> 19:45.184
and you are lying...Look, Nancy,

19:45.227 --> 19:47.447
we didn't take anything
from a murder scene.No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:49.623 --> 19:52.756
Anything we say to her could
make its way to Everett.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.149
[thunder rumbles]

19:54.193 --> 19:57.065
Wait, if Howard drove,
where's his car?

20:10.426 --> 20:12.428

20:15.518 --> 20:17.564
Your mother's beyond late
for our interview.

20:17.607 --> 20:19.609
RYAN:
Yeah, well, I told you.

20:19.653 --> 20:20.915
Before a party,
she's like a chicken

20:20.958 --> 20:22.351
with her head cut off, so...

20:22.395 --> 20:24.745
Hey, you didn't happen to see
a notebook

20:24.788 --> 20:26.268
at, uh, the hotel, did you?

20:26.312 --> 20:27.400
It would've been
in Howard's things?

20:27.443 --> 20:29.140
No. Why?

20:29.184 --> 20:31.099
Well, I think we're about
a half a step ahead of Nancy,

20:31.142 --> 20:33.101
but you're a lot closer
to the hotel than we are.

20:33.144 --> 20:34.624
I'm on it.

All I have to do is whistle.

You know you started
this whole thing, right?

21:42.388 --> 21:45.434
With your quest to drag every
Hudson on the front page.

21:45.478 --> 21:46.827
The ripple effect is spreading.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.219
You're gonna get
somebody killed.

21:48.263 --> 21:50.178
Maybe you
already did.

21:50.221 --> 21:51.701
That's not worth a Pulitzer.

21:51.745 --> 21:53.181
Okay, just give me the notebook.

21:53.224 --> 21:54.878
Give me the n...

21:57.533 --> 21:59.753
Now neither of us can have it.

22:24.865 --> 22:27.389
Howard wrote down
GPS coordinates

22:27.433 --> 22:29.783
that point
to the Hudson Hunting Lodge?

What the hell is there?

Hey, Bess.

22:35.615 --> 22:37.399
George wants to know
if you're ever gonna show up

22:37.443 --> 22:38.879
Oh.for your shift.

22:38.922 --> 22:40.402
Did-did she not get my text?
That's so weird.

22:40.446 --> 22:41.838
I can't come in.

22:41.882 --> 22:44.450
I convinced Nick and Ryan
to let me help.

22:44.493 --> 22:46.060
And I think I have a location.

22:46.103 --> 22:47.801
Of what?

22:47.844 --> 22:49.368
The thing they want
really badly.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.761
[gasps]
The Black Crown tape.

22:51.805 --> 22:53.154
Oh, my gosh, how did you get...

22:53.197 --> 22:54.329
Oh, sorry, that's Nick
calling on the other line.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.896
I got to go. Bye.

22:57.898 --> 23:00.074
Mm.

23:00.117 --> 23:02.293
I think Nancy just used
me for information.

23:02.337 --> 23:05.340
Yeah. And I don't know
how I feel about that.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.950
And I'm not sure
how I feel about Nancy

23:06.994 --> 23:10.476
skipping another shift again,
but, hey, here we all are.

23:10.519 --> 23:13.870
Hope Jesse feels like
being a waitress again today.

23:15.829 --> 23:19.310
Do you want to talk about
what's really bothering you?

23:20.399 --> 23:22.879
Hey, Ace told me
that Aunt Mei said

23:22.923 --> 23:24.403
something about your lifeline

23:24.446 --> 23:26.056
being cut short
'cause of Odette.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.319
[sighs]
Not talking about that.

23:28.363 --> 23:30.800
Anyway, you're just using that
as an excuse

23:30.844 --> 23:32.585
not to finish
your dating profile.

23:32.628 --> 23:35.675
No, I'm deleting that. No way.

23:35.718 --> 23:38.025
No, I'm gonna be a
ghost-whispering spinster

23:38.068 --> 23:41.158
for the rest of my life, and
no profile can change that.

23:41.202 --> 23:43.857
[laughs softly]
Read the latest draft.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.774
[sighs]

23:49.515 --> 23:50.820
"Looking for someone
whose sense of wonder

23:50.864 --> 23:52.692
"will match my own.

23:52.735 --> 23:55.782
"Someone who is open
to new experiences,

23:55.825 --> 23:57.479
"who is unafraid of looking
at the world in a way

23:57.523 --> 24:00.134
"that challenges prior beliefs.

24:00.177 --> 24:03.572
"Someone who is courageous
and loyal

24:03.616 --> 24:05.139
like I am."

24:05.182 --> 24:06.532
Mm-hmm.

24:08.664 --> 24:10.187
Just thought that people
should know the truth.

24:10.231 --> 24:11.798
You wrote this?

24:11.841 --> 24:13.321
With a little help
from Odette.

24:13.364 --> 24:15.366
Most of the good stuff
was her idea.

24:15.410 --> 24:16.629
But not all of it, of course.

24:16.672 --> 24:19.458
Some of it was mine.

24:19.501 --> 24:21.721
We both just want you
to be happy, Bess.

24:21.764 --> 24:23.287
[laughs]

24:23.331 --> 24:25.028
Thank you.
[sniffles]

24:26.029 --> 24:27.683
And...

24:27.727 --> 24:32.383
Hey, I won't press you
to tell me what Aunt Mei said,

24:32.427 --> 24:35.430
but if you are ready to
talk about it, then...

24:35.474 --> 24:38.825
I will come to you, I promise.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.392
Good.

24:47.964 --> 24:49.705
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

24:49.749 --> 24:52.969
I-I'm in the middle of trying

24:53.013 --> 24:54.841
to track something down
for your husband.

24:54.884 --> 24:56.538
The Black Crown tape.

24:56.582 --> 24:58.018
Have you heard of it?

24:58.061 --> 24:59.367
No.I'm just trying
to figure out

24:59.410 --> 25:03.327
if it's something
that E-Everett needs

25:03.371 --> 25:05.547
or it's something
that he already knows about

25:05.591 --> 25:07.549
and is using to trap me
or other people.

25:07.593 --> 25:08.811
Everett.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.554
I think Everett
found out.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.904
He knows our little secret.

25:16.297 --> 25:18.081
Are you sure? What did he say?

25:18.125 --> 25:20.519
I know my husband,
and something isn't right.

25:20.562 --> 25:23.086
I should have done
more to protect you.

25:23.130 --> 25:25.915
To protect myself.

25:25.959 --> 25:28.570
You're not the only secret
that I've kept from Everett.

25:28.614 --> 25:31.399
Now what if this has
put you in more danger?

25:31.442 --> 25:34.228
I mean, what kind
of a grandmother am I?

25:34.271 --> 25:35.795
I-I think that if Everett
knew the truth,

25:35.838 --> 25:38.014
he'd bother putting me
through a loyalty test.

25:38.058 --> 25:40.321
Right now,
I'm playing my part.

25:40.364 --> 25:41.888
As-as long as I get

25:41.931 --> 25:44.455
Everett the information
he needs about Howard,

25:44.499 --> 25:46.327
then I should be good.

25:46.370 --> 25:48.721
I'll have proven myself.

25:48.764 --> 25:52.028
Well, that's not
our only problem.

25:53.813 --> 25:57.730
The florist will not confirm
the details of our delivery.

25:57.773 --> 26:01.560
You know, you tell someone
that their work is substandard

26:01.603 --> 26:03.866
once, okay, maybe twice,
and all of a sudden

26:03.910 --> 26:05.651
they act as if they're
too good for your business.

26:07.348 --> 26:08.915
Okay, well, I will talk to Lily.

26:08.958 --> 26:10.786
Yes. Do that.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.658
And do tell her

26:12.701 --> 26:16.966
that I disapprove
of her customer service.

26:17.010 --> 26:20.317
I will... definitely
not do that.

26:23.016 --> 26:24.800
What I want to know is
why did Everett

26:24.844 --> 26:27.411
keep paying Bobbsey
after he went to jail.

26:27.455 --> 26:29.326
Was it to keep him quiet
about the Black Crown tape?

26:29.370 --> 26:31.372
No. No, Bobbsey would be dead

26:31.415 --> 26:33.635
if Everett thought
he knew about the tape.

26:33.679 --> 26:37.073
The payments Everett makes,
they're for former employees

26:37.117 --> 26:39.685
that are in jail now,
you know, it keeps them happy.

26:39.728 --> 26:40.903
Happy people don't talk

26:40.947 --> 26:42.470
to the Feds about who they saw

26:42.513 --> 26:43.863
coming and going from the lodge

26:43.906 --> 26:46.082
or what they overheard
over the years.

26:46.126 --> 26:48.998
It's kind of like
an insurance policy, you know?

26:49.042 --> 26:50.304
Wait.

26:54.743 --> 26:56.963
This is a greenhouse.

26:57.006 --> 26:58.399
We didn't have a greenhouse.

26:58.442 --> 26:59.792
Really?
No.

26:59.835 --> 27:01.141
VAL:
Must be a clue.

27:01.184 --> 27:03.970
What did you have
that was green?

27:04.013 --> 27:07.974
Uh, tennis courts were green,
uh, swimming pool topiaries.

27:08.017 --> 27:09.192
The old stable

27:09.236 --> 27:10.454
was green.

27:10.498 --> 27:11.891
"Greenhouse."

27:11.934 --> 27:13.806
What was, uh, overgrown?

27:13.849 --> 27:15.242
I mean, pretty much everything.

27:15.285 --> 27:16.678
Bobbsey was a lousy
groundskeeper.

27:16.722 --> 27:18.419
Again, no offense.

27:18.462 --> 27:19.594
Okay, well-well,
what did he work on

27:19.638 --> 27:20.639
that was especially
half-assed?

27:20.682 --> 27:21.814
Well, the old stables.

27:21.857 --> 27:23.467
For sure.
And the aviaries.

27:23.511 --> 27:25.339
Totally normal thing
to have.

27:25.382 --> 27:26.557
Family mausoleum

27:26.601 --> 27:27.820
Was overgrown.

27:27.863 --> 27:29.125
The...

27:31.084 --> 27:32.781
Was he trying to tell us...?

27:32.825 --> 27:34.696
"Everyone knows where
the bodies are buried."

27:34.740 --> 27:36.916
Yeah, leave it to my dad
to have a sick sense of humor

27:36.959 --> 27:39.309
about where he hides stuff.

27:39.353 --> 27:41.007
Okay, come on.

27:41.050 --> 27:43.879
It's time to go visit
to my favorite relatives.

27:43.923 --> 27:45.489
The dead ones.

27:50.146 --> 27:52.192
[phone buzzing]

27:56.718 --> 27:58.285
Hello, Everett.

27:58.328 --> 28:00.374
What can I do for you?

28:00.417 --> 28:02.245
I wanted to check
on your progress.

28:02.289 --> 28:03.638
Unfortunately,

28:03.682 --> 28:07.729
Howard was found dead
in his hotel.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.731
Apparently it was a suicide.

28:09.775 --> 28:11.951
That's regrettable.

28:11.994 --> 28:15.737
Perhaps he was motivated
by his guilt about betraying me.

28:15.781 --> 28:18.131
Were you able to glean
any information

28:18.174 --> 28:20.220
about who he had been
in contact with?

28:20.263 --> 28:24.224
I was able to locate
his personal notebook, and, um,

28:24.267 --> 28:28.707
the-the most recent entry
before he killed himself

28:28.750 --> 28:30.447
indicates that he met
with someone who gave him

28:30.491 --> 28:31.710
a string of numbers.

28:34.103 --> 28:37.237
I can't figure out
what the numbers mean yet,

28:37.280 --> 28:40.109
but maybe a bank account?

28:44.635 --> 28:46.986
Focus on who gave him
the numbers.

28:47.029 --> 28:50.772
It's imperative that I learn
the identity of that person.

28:50.816 --> 28:55.124
Celia led me to believe you were
more effective than this.

29:00.695 --> 29:03.306
Okay. So...

29:03.350 --> 29:07.484
Everett didn't ask
what the numbers mean

29:07.528 --> 29:09.878
because he already knows.

29:09.922 --> 29:13.403
He wanted to know
who Howard's contact was.

29:13.447 --> 29:16.842
But he must have a way
of finding that out now.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.806
[sighs]

29:38.733 --> 29:41.170
Hey, you know
it's not too late to...

29:42.389 --> 29:46.175
Is that... new?

29:46.219 --> 29:48.525
Yeah, it was a
gift from a friend.

29:48.569 --> 29:49.526
What were you saying?

29:49.570 --> 29:51.615
Um, I was...

29:53.574 --> 29:55.228
I was saying
that it's not too late

29:55.271 --> 29:56.882
for you to change your mind
about this party.

29:56.925 --> 29:59.362
You're putting yourself in
danger, and you know it, Nancy.

29:59.406 --> 30:00.711
You're being reckless.

30:00.755 --> 30:03.714
I am trying to stay alive.

30:03.758 --> 30:05.847
And I'm trying to keep
my friends alive.

30:05.891 --> 30:10.852
And I am trying to be
everything to everyone

30:10.896 --> 30:13.637
and I'm so sick
of everybody doubting me

30:13.681 --> 30:16.249
instead of trusting me,
because I know what I'm doing.

30:16.292 --> 30:17.554
I do trust you.

30:17.598 --> 30:20.035
Nancy, I do trust you.
I'm sorry.

30:20.079 --> 30:21.776
I'm just...

30:22.864 --> 30:24.213
I worry.

30:24.257 --> 30:26.215
Don't.

30:26.259 --> 30:28.957
Okay.

30:29.001 --> 30:33.266
So, then at least humor me.

30:33.309 --> 30:35.572
For old times' sake?

30:40.099 --> 30:42.144
[exhales]

30:52.807 --> 30:54.417
One...

30:54.461 --> 30:56.332
[camera whirring]

30:56.376 --> 30:58.421
You cheated.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.210
[exhales]
Okay.

31:04.253 --> 31:06.212
And...

31:06.255 --> 31:08.214
Thank you.You're welcome.

31:09.171 --> 31:11.739
Be safe tonight.

31:11.782 --> 31:13.567
Especially around Everett.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.264
I will.

31:18.615 --> 31:21.183
I won't walk into any traps.

31:25.013 --> 31:27.189
I won't walk into any traps.

31:27.233 --> 31:28.669
What's wrong?

31:28.712 --> 31:30.279
Nick and Ryan are about
to make a huge mistake

31:30.323 --> 31:31.324
and I need to go stop them.

31:38.940 --> 31:41.290
[crow cawing]

31:42.422 --> 31:43.902
[phone buzzing]

31:47.209 --> 31:49.516
[phone continues buzzing]

31:49.559 --> 31:51.344
[buzzing stops]

31:52.345 --> 31:53.346
[phone buzzing]

31:59.569 --> 32:00.831
Hi. This is Ned Nickerson.

32:00.875 --> 32:01.920
I can't come to the phone
right now.

32:01.963 --> 32:04.009
Please leave a message.

32:04.052 --> 32:06.402
NICK:
Let's get this videotape and
send Everett to jail for good.

32:06.446 --> 32:08.752
[phone buzzing]

32:19.981 --> 32:21.635
[grunting quietly]

32:24.768 --> 32:26.379
[closing door echoes]

32:55.234 --> 32:57.279
â™ª

33:00.761 --> 33:01.718
[sighs]

33:01.762 --> 33:03.198
Your family.

33:03.242 --> 33:06.027
You get to desecrate
their graves.

33:07.681 --> 33:08.987
Okay.

33:09.030 --> 33:11.990
Let's start
with the closest one.

33:13.556 --> 33:15.732
VAL:
22 archaeologists died

33:15.776 --> 33:17.908
opening
Tutankhamun's tomb.

33:17.952 --> 33:19.693
You believe in curses?

33:20.694 --> 33:22.435
RYAN:
Hey, can we not

33:22.478 --> 33:24.089
right now, please?

33:31.574 --> 33:33.794
[gasps softly]

33:33.837 --> 33:36.362
Do you think
he put it...

33:36.405 --> 33:37.798
in there?

33:37.841 --> 33:39.843
Nah, I know my dad's messed up,

33:39.887 --> 33:41.976
but I don't think
he'd go that far.

33:43.934 --> 33:45.719
Hey, guys?

33:45.762 --> 33:48.635
This one barely has
any dust on it.

33:48.678 --> 33:51.072
And the seal looks fresh.

33:51.116 --> 33:53.118
"Elora Hudson."

33:53.161 --> 33:55.642
My Aunt Elora, she was cremated.

34:04.607 --> 34:06.087
No dust.

34:06.131 --> 34:07.567
[Ryan grunts softly]

34:07.610 --> 34:10.396
I thought Everett hid
this evidence years ago.

34:10.439 --> 34:11.484
NANCY:
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

34:12.485 --> 34:13.921
Stop!

34:16.271 --> 34:18.404
What's going on?You just walked

34:18.447 --> 34:20.580
right into
Everett's trap.

34:21.581 --> 34:23.670
[quietly]:
What?

34:28.327 --> 34:30.546
[sighs]
Smile, Ryan,

34:30.590 --> 34:33.071
we're on camera.

34:37.510 --> 34:39.512
I was calling you to warn you.

34:39.555 --> 34:42.384
I spent all day today
trying to make sure

34:42.428 --> 34:43.820
that this didn't happen!

34:43.864 --> 34:45.561
And you played
right into his hand.

34:45.605 --> 34:47.172
Now Everett thinks

34:47.215 --> 34:49.826
that you and Val are
the people that Howard

34:49.870 --> 34:51.480
was leaking to.

34:51.524 --> 34:53.482
Your father knows
that you betrayed him.

34:53.526 --> 34:55.397
The evidence we
were hunting down,

34:55.441 --> 34:57.138
it-it was worth
the risk.

34:57.182 --> 34:58.531
Was it?

34:58.574 --> 35:01.099
The videotape isn't in there,

35:01.142 --> 35:02.622
because of course
it's not,

35:02.665 --> 35:04.493
because Everett moved it
the second he found out

35:04.537 --> 35:06.016
that Howard was
looking into to.

35:06.060 --> 35:08.367
And now Val and Ryan
are next on his hit list.

35:08.410 --> 35:09.890
Congratulations.

35:09.933 --> 35:11.413
VAL:
Okay, but he's
not actually

35:11.457 --> 35:14.024
gonna go after his own son.Yes, he is.

35:14.068 --> 35:16.984
Even if he regrets it later,
when Everett gets angry,

35:17.027 --> 35:18.638
he can't control himself.

35:18.681 --> 35:20.901
He sees red.You need
to get her

35:20.944 --> 35:21.858
out of town.

35:21.902 --> 35:23.164
Now.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.818
No credit cards.
Nothing in her name.

35:24.861 --> 35:26.646
Ditch your cell phone.

35:26.689 --> 35:28.822
No communication with work or
with Ryan or your favorite aunt.

35:28.865 --> 35:31.041
Okay? Not until
Everett is gone.

35:31.085 --> 35:33.000
Hey, hey, hey.
Where you going?

35:33.043 --> 35:36.046
Celia managed to convince
Everette to trust me.

35:36.090 --> 35:38.397
If anyone
can stop him from doing

35:38.440 --> 35:41.356
whatever he's about to do
to Val and Ryan, it's Celia.

35:41.400 --> 35:42.531
[car door opens]

35:42.575 --> 35:43.706
[engine starts]

35:54.674 --> 35:57.242
â™ª

35:57.285 --> 35:59.635
We need to talk,
in private.

35:59.679 --> 36:01.071
Would you help me?

36:01.115 --> 36:04.249
The champagne flutes
are still in the boxes.

36:06.903 --> 36:08.775
Ryan is in trouble.

36:08.818 --> 36:10.820
He was the one
working with Howard,

36:10.864 --> 36:13.432
and now Everett knows.Everett?

36:13.475 --> 36:16.478
I think he knows
our secret.

36:16.522 --> 36:19.525
Yeah, I know. You-you
told me that earlier.

36:20.526 --> 36:22.571
Are you okay?

36:24.138 --> 36:27.010
Why aren't you dressed
for the party?

36:34.888 --> 36:38.587
The champagne flutes should be
in here somewhere.

37:08.487 --> 37:10.228
[gasps]

37:10.967 --> 37:13.796
[screams]

37:26.940 --> 37:28.942
[shuddering]

37:37.820 --> 37:40.083
The body is
in rigor mortis,

37:40.127 --> 37:44.523
so you've been dead
a minimum of eight to 12 hours.

37:44.566 --> 37:46.786
Maybe all day.

37:46.829 --> 37:48.831
You kept talking about Everett.

37:48.875 --> 37:51.138
[echoing]:
I think Everett found out.

37:51.181 --> 37:53.358
He knows our little secret.

37:53.401 --> 37:54.750
Did Everett kill you?

37:54.794 --> 37:56.839
I don't know.Did-did he hire
somebody?

37:56.883 --> 37:58.363
Was it because of me,
because of...

37:58.406 --> 38:00.103
because he found out,
or was it something else?

38:00.147 --> 38:01.888
I don't remember.
I can't remember.

38:01.931 --> 38:04.717
My God,
how far ahead of me is he?

38:04.760 --> 38:07.328
I thought that I was just having
to pass a loyalty test,

38:07.372 --> 38:08.677
but I already failed.

38:08.721 --> 38:10.157
He...

38:10.200 --> 38:13.465
he murdered you for lying.

38:13.508 --> 38:14.770
His own wife!

38:14.814 --> 38:16.468
And if he's willing
to kill you...

38:16.511 --> 38:18.470
I thought...
I was trying to pr...

38:18.513 --> 38:20.341
I thought that
I could protect everybody,

38:20.385 --> 38:22.952
but now I don't stand a chance.

38:22.996 --> 38:24.606
I don't stand a chance.

38:24.650 --> 38:26.695
[sobbing]It's okay.

38:28.828 --> 38:31.047
Shh...

38:31.091 --> 38:33.876
[whispers]:
It's okay.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.965
I am so sorry.

38:40.056 --> 38:42.494
I can't stay.

38:42.537 --> 38:44.670
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

38:44.713 --> 38:46.193
[wind rushing]Don't go.

38:46.236 --> 38:48.630
No, please don't go.

38:48.674 --> 38:52.504
[indistinct voices in distance]

38:52.547 --> 38:54.593
[eerie, echoing breath]

39:01.643 --> 39:05.255
[breath trembling]

39:09.738 --> 39:11.436
ACE:
You're gonna want
to get a new one

39:11.479 --> 39:14.090
in a week or two, max,
just to be safe.

39:14.134 --> 39:16.266
I got Ryan a
burner phone, too.

39:16.310 --> 39:18.225
The number's in there--
just, you can't call him

39:18.268 --> 39:19.618
from any other line.

39:19.661 --> 39:21.228
Not sure how you feel
about sardines,

39:21.271 --> 39:23.230
but...[Bess groans]

39:23.273 --> 39:25.145
This box is pretty
unfortunate, but this book

39:25.188 --> 39:26.799
is really good-- so take that.

39:26.842 --> 39:28.931
And then this sweater is
kind of cute,

39:28.975 --> 39:30.716
but wash it before
you wear it.

39:30.759 --> 39:32.152
Listen,

39:32.195 --> 39:34.589
this is gonna hold you over
for a while.

39:34.633 --> 39:38.071
No. No, no.
I can't take this.Yes. Yes, you can.

39:38.114 --> 39:39.594
You have to.No. I can help you
figure this out.

39:39.638 --> 39:42.771
I don't want to leave you.

39:42.815 --> 39:44.991
Let's give them
a minute, guys.

39:47.733 --> 39:49.517
Look, Nick can stay, all right?

39:49.561 --> 39:51.519
Because he wasn't caught
on camera.

39:51.563 --> 39:54.000
So he's safe for a while,
but you and I, we're not.

39:54.043 --> 39:56.219
My dad will send
somebody for you.Yeah, but what about you?

39:56.263 --> 39:59.266
I'm gonna stay,
and I'm gonna fight this.

39:59.309 --> 40:01.703
Okay? I can buy time,
but you can't.

40:01.747 --> 40:03.879
But when it's safe,

40:03.923 --> 40:05.925
I'm gonna come get you.

40:05.968 --> 40:07.666
But until then,
I need you to stay underground.

40:07.709 --> 40:10.190
And I need to make sure
that you're okay,

40:10.233 --> 40:13.672
'cause I have already lost
too many women
that I care about.

40:14.673 --> 40:17.197
[exhales]
Care about?

40:25.858 --> 40:30.253
â™ª The tone of your voice
when speaking... â™ª

40:31.254 --> 40:33.605
Take care of the reporter now.

40:33.648 --> 40:36.216
I'll speak to Ryan myself.

40:36.912 --> 40:40.176
â™ª I can't take much more â™ª

40:40.220 --> 40:42.048
How...

40:42.091 --> 40:44.485
theatrical.

40:44.529 --> 40:46.835
Nice dress.

40:46.879 --> 40:48.924
â™ª

40:56.845 --> 40:59.108
â™ª Much more...

40:59.152 --> 41:00.980
You hired me because you
were worried about Howard

41:01.023 --> 41:01.981
and what information

41:02.024 --> 41:04.374
he might have leaked.

41:04.418 --> 41:06.289
But it's not him
you should be worried about.

41:07.769 --> 41:10.380
â™ª And I'm waiting, waiting

41:10.424 --> 41:12.992
What are those marks?

41:13.035 --> 41:15.342
â™ª Patiently

41:15.385 --> 41:20.565
â™ª I'll wait patient,
I'll wait patient â™ª

41:20.608 --> 41:24.307
Mm. Then who should I
be worried about,

41:24.351 --> 41:26.788
in your estimation?

41:30.009 --> 41:31.401
Me.

41:33.752 --> 41:35.231
Your granddaughter.

41:36.232 --> 41:37.538
[rapid clicking]

41:37.582 --> 41:39.148
[strained grunting]

41:41.760 --> 41:45.198
â™ª I'm waiting, waiting

41:45.241 --> 41:47.722
â™ª Patient, patiently...

41:47.766 --> 41:50.943
Okay, Gil, let's go.
