WEBVTT

00:00.382 --> 00:01.950
<i>Previously on Heartland:</i>

00:02.118 --> 00:03.885
And I might be willing
to out a deal with you

00:04.153 --> 00:05.787
based on sweat equity.

00:05.854 --> 00:07.088
I do enough sweating
around here.

00:07.156 --> 00:08.890
This way,
your sweat could be

00:08.957 --> 00:10.057
an investment
in the future.

00:10.125 --> 00:11.426
Copper would be
half yours.

00:11.493 --> 00:12.493
Sweet!

00:12.561 --> 00:14.261
I hear that
Caleb's back, huh?

00:14.329 --> 00:15.563
Yeah.

00:15.631 --> 00:18.499
I guess I should never
have done what I did.

00:18.567 --> 00:20.601
Yup!
I bought him off.

00:20.669 --> 00:21.736
No doubt about it.

00:21.804 --> 00:23.003
So what are you waiting for?

00:23.071 --> 00:24.204
<i>I mean, just tell her
how you feel.</i>

00:24.272 --> 00:25.071
How am I supposed
to do that?

00:25.139 --> 00:26.440
She won't even talk to me.

00:26.507 --> 00:27.774
Are you breaking up
with me?

00:27.842 --> 00:28.842
No, it's just-

00:28.910 --> 00:30.209
This whole time,
it's been Amy, right?

00:30.277 --> 00:31.344
No!

00:31.412 --> 00:33.079
I think we should
just be friends.

00:39.954 --> 00:40.986
You all set?

00:41.054 --> 00:43.722
I've been up
for hours.

00:43.790 --> 00:45.691
It's a roommate issue.

00:45.759 --> 00:47.693
<i>Hey, listen, uh,</i>

00:47.761 --> 00:49.628
I haven't told Amy about this,
so keep it to yourself.

00:49.696 --> 00:53.065
But I got these
in the mail this week.

00:53.132 --> 00:54.533
You got accepted
at two places?

00:54.601 --> 00:55.734
Yeah.

00:55.802 --> 00:57.134
Grasslands Agricultural
College,

00:57.202 --> 00:59.604
and University of Manitoba.

00:59.672 --> 01:00.905
What do you think's better?

01:00.973 --> 01:02.073
<i>Well, they're both pretty good,</i>

01:02.140 --> 01:03.975
but if you go to
the Agricultural College,

01:04.042 --> 01:05.944
you're going to have to
put up with the jokes.

01:06.011 --> 01:06.911
The jokes?

01:06.979 --> 01:09.013
Aggie jokes.
Like, uh...

01:09.081 --> 01:10.748
There are three types
of aggies.

01:10.816 --> 01:12.416
Those who can count.

01:12.484 --> 01:14.451
And those who can't.

01:19.891 --> 01:21.257
I work for sweat equity, okay,

01:21.325 --> 01:23.026
and now I've got to do his job?

01:23.094 --> 01:24.495
Let's do the math.

01:24.562 --> 01:26.497
Twice the work, so two times
nothing comes out to...

01:26.564 --> 01:27.998
Yeah, okay.
I get it Mallory.

01:28.065 --> 01:29.365
But somebody's got
to pick up the slack.

01:29.432 --> 01:30.600
Right. Slack.

01:30.667 --> 01:32.768
Another word for "manure."

01:34.337 --> 01:36.405
One tall stack,
two eggs over easy,

01:36.473 --> 01:38.073
and a side of bacon.

01:39.643 --> 01:40.943
Someone's feeling flush today.

01:41.011 --> 01:42.111
Ah, you betcha.

01:42.178 --> 01:44.513
Won broncs
at the Caroline rodeo.

01:44.580 --> 01:45.547
Got a big ol' cheque

01:45.615 --> 01:46.681
burning a hole
in my pocket.

01:46.749 --> 01:49.050
To match that hole
in your head?

01:50.586 --> 01:52.020
What did I say?

01:52.087 --> 01:53.054
<i>You didn't have to say
anything.</i>

01:53.122 --> 01:55.189
Your face did the talking
for you.

01:55.257 --> 01:58.393
It just reminds her what
a reckless idiot you are.

01:58.460 --> 01:59.394
Comes with the territory.

01:59.461 --> 02:00.694
Exactly.

02:00.762 --> 02:02.663
I mean, who'd gonna take
a bronc rider seriously

02:02.731 --> 02:04.197
as boyfriend material?

02:04.265 --> 02:09.235
Unless you holding a life
insurance policy on him.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.506
Hey, are you sure
you're okay with this?

02:12.574 --> 02:14.307
Phew,
absolutely.

02:14.375 --> 02:16.343
Because I could just cook up
something for the two of us.

02:16.411 --> 02:18.277
No.
Are you kidding me?

02:18.345 --> 02:19.979
A sit-down dinner
with the whole family?

02:20.047 --> 02:21.014
It's gonna be great.

02:21.081 --> 02:22.682
It totally seals
the deal.

02:22.750 --> 02:23.883
Like a regular
couple now.

02:23.951 --> 02:25.151
Doing regular
couple things.

02:25.218 --> 02:26.185
Right, yeah.

02:26.253 --> 02:27.921
Like um...
Getting dessert.

02:27.988 --> 02:28.721
Hey, do you want
a cake?

02:28.789 --> 02:29.622
Yeah, sure.

02:29.690 --> 02:31.791
Only if you
jump out of it.

02:31.859 --> 02:34.526
Yeah, that's the thing
about our family dinners...

02:34.594 --> 02:36.528
I only jump out
of cakes on birthdays.

02:36.596 --> 02:36.995
<i>Oh yeah?</i>

02:37.063 --> 02:37.829
Mm-hmm.

02:37.897 --> 02:39.164
What about
after the cake?

02:39.231 --> 02:42.067
With that other thing
that normal couples do, hmm?

02:42.134 --> 02:43.101
What thing?

02:43.169 --> 02:43.902
Hmm?

02:45.137 --> 02:46.038
I'm sorry.

02:46.105 --> 02:47.138
But I cannot
kiss a man

02:47.206 --> 02:49.740
whose pocket
is vibrating.

02:51.309 --> 02:52.276
28 missed calls?

02:52.343 --> 02:53.010
Yeah.

02:53.078 --> 02:54.511
You know what that is?

02:54.580 --> 02:56.681
My contractor with
28 lame excuses

02:56.748 --> 02:58.549
why my office renovations
won't be done by Monday.

02:58.617 --> 02:59.717
That's what that is.

02:59.785 --> 03:01.018
Yeah?

03:01.086 --> 03:03.520
Well, why don't you
just stay out here?

03:03.589 --> 03:05.521
Oh, yeah.
Sure.

03:05.590 --> 03:07.423
I'd get lots of work
done that way, wouldn't I?

03:07.491 --> 03:08.257
Exactly.

03:08.325 --> 03:10.060
Huh?

03:10.127 --> 03:11.962
<i>How you get a one armed aggie
out of a tree?</i>

03:12.029 --> 03:13.063
<i>Scott.</i>

03:13.130 --> 03:14.998
<i>You wave.</i>

03:15.066 --> 03:17.567
<i>Hey, you could've told me we
were going to the Bailey place.</i>

03:17.635 --> 03:19.669
Kit's mare's in foal.

03:19.737 --> 03:22.170
Why?
Is there a problem?

03:26.142 --> 03:26.609
<i>Hey Scott.</i>

03:26.676 --> 03:27.676
Hey.

03:31.447 --> 03:32.380
<i>Hi.</i>

03:32.448 --> 03:33.616
Didn't expect
to be seeing you.

03:33.683 --> 03:37.551
Yeah. Uh, just been
working with Scott.

03:37.620 --> 03:39.353
So this is your
barrel racing mare?

03:39.421 --> 03:40.321
Yeah.

03:41.456 --> 03:43.224
I'm gonna have a look.

03:43.291 --> 03:45.526
So uh, how you been?
You okay?

03:45.594 --> 03:47.629
Yeah. Yeah,
why wouldn't I be?

03:47.696 --> 03:49.163
<i>Well, she's all bagged up.</i>

03:49.231 --> 03:51.099
There's swelling,
a bit of dried milk...

03:51.166 --> 03:52.633
I meant to call you,
Kit. I just-

03:52.700 --> 03:55.002
Yeah,
you've been busy.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.036
Come on, Kit.

03:56.104 --> 03:57.537
<i>Hey!</i>

03:57.605 --> 04:00.340
Good news!
Your mare's gonna pop!

04:00.407 --> 04:02.643
Well, I mean, not now.

04:02.710 --> 04:05.311
<i>But could be any day...</i>

04:05.379 --> 04:06.479
Awesome.

04:08.182 --> 04:09.081
<i>Looks good, Mallory.</i>

04:09.149 --> 04:09.815
<i>Just make sure you sweep up</i>

04:09.883 --> 04:10.816
after you're finished.

04:10.884 --> 04:11.817
Sweep up?

04:11.885 --> 04:14.253
Um, sure I can
handle that?

04:14.320 --> 04:17.189
Come on, Mallory.
What is your problem?

04:17.257 --> 04:18.390
<i>Nothing.</i>

04:18.458 --> 04:20.492
Just that I wouldn't mind
working with a real live horse,

04:20.560 --> 04:21.459
instead of just their poo.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.263
Do you hear that?

04:24.364 --> 04:25.764
It sounds like...

04:28.201 --> 04:29.734
Grampa?

04:29.802 --> 04:31.503
Grampa!

04:31.571 --> 04:33.805
I heard you
the first time.

04:34.940 --> 04:37.042
Promise you won't
get mad?

04:42.113 --> 04:44.482
What do you think
you're doing?

04:44.550 --> 04:45.983
Well, you remember that money
you lent me?

04:46.051 --> 04:48.419
You loaned Dad money?

04:48.487 --> 04:50.588
Jack, I'm paying it back.

04:51.557 --> 04:52.523
In cows.

04:54.726 --> 04:55.526
<i>Come on.</i>

05:41.787 --> 05:42.954
Wow, grampa,

05:43.021 --> 05:44.622
I cannot believe you said yes.

05:44.690 --> 05:45.956
I got to admit,

05:46.023 --> 05:47.123
I might have been a little
reluctant at first.

05:47.191 --> 05:47.891
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

05:47.959 --> 05:49.292
For two seconds.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.760
That's how long it took me
to recall

05:50.828 --> 05:52.629
that some of the best years
of my life were spent

05:52.697 --> 05:54.297
in the company of cows.

05:54.365 --> 05:55.899
You picked a good time
to jump back in, too, Jack.

05:55.967 --> 05:57.501
Cattle prices
being what they are.

05:57.568 --> 05:59.135
Exactly what I was thinking.

05:59.203 --> 06:02.505
Wait. You're thinking
what he's thinking?

06:02.572 --> 06:04.339
Finally found
some common ground.

06:04.407 --> 06:05.741
<i>Yeah. It's called global warming.</i>

06:05.809 --> 06:08.343
Everybody knows that oil guys
and cattle ranchers

06:08.411 --> 06:11.079
are the major causes of land
and water pollution!

06:11.147 --> 06:13.215
Just for
everyone's information,

06:13.282 --> 06:15.083
Peter's company is doing
everything it can

06:15.151 --> 06:16.886
to minimize its carbon
footprint.

06:16.953 --> 06:19.654
In fact, uh, the whole screw up
with my renovation

06:19.722 --> 06:21.188
is because it takes twice
as long

06:21.256 --> 06:23.224
to build a green office space.

06:23.291 --> 06:25.627
Well, if an oilman
can claim he's gone green,

06:25.694 --> 06:27.294
maybe I should, too.

06:27.362 --> 06:31.566
Maybe I could get my cows
to quit passing gas.

06:35.537 --> 06:36.570
You would not believe

06:36.638 --> 06:37.704
how much Scott
packs into a day.

06:37.805 --> 06:39.305
Like what?

06:39.373 --> 06:41.608
Well, there were some coggins
tests at Forrest farms.

06:41.676 --> 06:45.512
Uh, there was a case
of colic at the Bar H.

06:45.580 --> 06:47.514
The Bailey's mare
is in foal.

06:47.582 --> 06:48.682
Scott says I'm getting
pretty handy

06:48.750 --> 06:49.882
with the rectal
thermometer.

06:49.950 --> 06:52.084
The Bailey's?
Like, Kit's mare?

06:52.152 --> 06:53.019
Yeah.

06:53.086 --> 06:54.854
Oh.
Why didn't you tell me?

06:54.922 --> 06:56.388
Well, I guess
the next place we went,

06:56.456 --> 06:57.924
Scott gelded three colts.

06:57.991 --> 06:59.091
Now that's an image
that's gonna

06:59.159 --> 07:00.392
stay in your mind
for a while.

07:00.460 --> 07:03.429
Yeah, but you didn't date
whoever owned the colts.

07:03.496 --> 07:05.431
Hey, you work with Caleb
all the time.

07:05.498 --> 07:06.665
And you used to date him.

07:06.732 --> 07:08.132
I did not date him.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.301
We just kind of hung out.

07:10.369 --> 07:12.704
Okay, maybe we dated but...

07:12.805 --> 07:14.105
It's your fault anyway!

07:14.173 --> 07:15.373
Oh, you're blaming me
for this?

07:15.441 --> 07:17.175
Well...
Not for everything.

07:18.277 --> 07:19.878
Just, you know,
for taking off on me.

07:19.946 --> 07:22.112
So I had hang out with Caleb
instead of you.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.380
Oh.

07:23.448 --> 07:27.484
So you better make sure
that never happens again.

07:29.000 --> 07:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:43.467 --> 07:45.568
You know, I've been thinking
about what you said.

07:45.636 --> 07:48.071
You mean, about you
being an idiot?

07:48.138 --> 07:49.271
<i>I mean, you know,</i>

07:49.589 --> 07:51.090
if I fall on my head
one more time,

07:51.158 --> 07:53.992
I could end up
getting brain damaged.

07:54.060 --> 07:56.228
Yeah, but nobody'd notice.

07:56.295 --> 07:57.795
Hey, Mr. Fleming.

07:57.864 --> 07:59.030
<i>How you doin'?</i>

07:59.098 --> 08:00.065
You know, I was just
telling Soraya here

08:00.132 --> 08:01.532
I'm thinking of quitting
broncs.

08:01.600 --> 08:04.035
<i>Though maybe I'd try
bulldoggin'.</i>

08:04.103 --> 08:05.570
Yeah?

08:05.637 --> 08:07.172
Hmm.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.940
<i>Buldoggin', huh?</i>

08:09.008 --> 08:10.307
<i>I'm a little rusty,</i>

08:10.375 --> 08:12.276
but I could probably
give you a few pointers.

08:12.344 --> 08:13.844
That would be awesome.

08:13.912 --> 08:14.778
Okay.
Tomorrow morning.

08:14.846 --> 08:15.980
9 A.M. at the rodeo
grounds.

08:16.047 --> 08:19.215
Yeah? Sold.
Yeah, that's great.

08:19.351 --> 08:20.484
All right.

08:22.487 --> 08:23.988
What's the matter?

08:24.055 --> 08:25.356
You're kidding,
right?

08:25.423 --> 08:26.622
Bulldogging
with Tim Fleming?

08:26.690 --> 08:29.759
That's like Wayne Gretzky
teaching you to skate!

08:34.030 --> 08:36.732
So how's your coffee?

08:36.799 --> 08:38.634
It's the best coffee
I've ever had in my life.

08:38.702 --> 08:39.835
Yeah?

08:39.904 --> 08:41.837
Uh, how's your cell
reception?

08:41.905 --> 08:42.938
Are you still
looking for an excuse

08:43.006 --> 08:44.072
to get your hand
in my shirt?

08:44.140 --> 08:46.041
No. I'm just trying
to get you to see

08:46.109 --> 08:47.943
that you don't have to go
all the way back to Calgary

08:48.011 --> 08:49.878
just to work out
of your house.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.812
You could stay here.

08:51.880 --> 08:53.080
Work out of my office.

08:53.148 --> 08:54.448
- Your office?
- Yeah.

08:54.516 --> 08:56.117
That's the, the one
in the barn, right?

08:56.184 --> 08:58.052
With the view
of the manure pile? Is that-

08:58.120 --> 08:59.653
Hey!
That's where I work of.

08:59.721 --> 09:00.554
I know.

09:00.622 --> 09:01.522
I mean, sure,

09:01.589 --> 09:03.057
you run a multinational,

09:03.125 --> 09:05.259
and I run a four bedroom
dude ranch.

09:05.327 --> 09:07.894
But business is business.

09:07.962 --> 09:10.797
I have high speed.
You have your computer.

09:10.864 --> 09:12.299
Yeah...

09:12.366 --> 09:13.967
It could work.

09:16.637 --> 09:18.604
That should be
the last of it.

09:18.672 --> 09:20.907
I guess we're square?

09:22.043 --> 09:24.009
Well, I have to say,

09:24.077 --> 09:25.277
I'm a little surprised
how much money

09:25.345 --> 09:28.180
a young man can win
riding bucking horses.

09:28.248 --> 09:30.349
Then again,
the way your face looks,

09:30.417 --> 09:31.883
I guess you earned it,
huh?

09:31.952 --> 09:33.652
Well, that's why
I'm thinking of switching

09:33.719 --> 09:34.853
to something
a little safer.

09:34.921 --> 09:35.854
Oh?

09:35.922 --> 09:36.855
Bulldogging.

09:36.923 --> 09:38.157
I'm hoping Ashley
will appreciate

09:38.224 --> 09:42.226
that I'm trying to be
a little more responsible.

09:42.294 --> 09:43.928
You really do care
for my daughter, don't you?

09:43.996 --> 09:45.629
Yes ma'am.
I do.

09:45.697 --> 09:50.768
But I wouldn't go so far as
saying the feeling's mutual.

09:50.836 --> 09:51.635
Why don't you keep this.

09:51.703 --> 09:53.471
No ma'am.
I owe it to you.

09:53.538 --> 09:55.772
Just, call it rent
for your trailer,

09:55.840 --> 09:57.574
whatever you like.
Just keep it.

09:57.641 --> 09:58.641
What's going on
with you, Mrs. Stanton?

09:58.709 --> 09:59.609
Is everything all right?

10:00.744 --> 10:02.812
Yes, I'm just...

10:02.880 --> 10:04.747
Trying to set things right.

10:04.815 --> 10:06.683
I don't want anything
hanging over my head.

10:06.750 --> 10:08.218
Well, thanks for the offer.

10:08.286 --> 10:09.519
I do appreciate it,

10:09.587 --> 10:11.387
but taking money from you
is what got me in trouble

10:11.455 --> 10:12.721
in the first place.

10:12.789 --> 10:14.123
So maybe not taking
money from you now

10:14.191 --> 10:17.626
might be a step towards
me setting things right.

10:17.694 --> 10:20.929
You have a good day,
Mrs. Stanton.

10:24.234 --> 10:26.302
<i>You okay there, Mallory?</i>

10:26.370 --> 10:28.136
I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.

10:28.204 --> 10:30.138
I'll manage somehow.

10:30.206 --> 10:33.475
How about I give you
a hand with that?

10:33.542 --> 10:35.343
You're in a good mood, Jack.

10:35.411 --> 10:37.879
Well, first day back
on the range

10:37.946 --> 10:40.248
and it went smooth as silk.

10:40.316 --> 10:42.150
And I'm always in a good mood!

10:42.218 --> 10:43.384
<i>Hey, Grampa?</i>

10:43.451 --> 10:44.551
Where's Ty? I thought
he was with you.

10:44.619 --> 10:46.053
Left before breakfast.

10:46.121 --> 10:47.154
Something about a mare

10:47.222 --> 10:49.289
<i>at the Bailey place.</i>

10:50.958 --> 10:53.260
The Bailey place?
As in Kit Bailey?

10:53.328 --> 10:55.462
Yes, Mallory. With Scott.

10:55.530 --> 10:58.765
It's his job.
Her mare is in foal.

10:58.833 --> 11:00.333
Yeah, I
wouldn't worry about it.

11:00.401 --> 11:02.101
He's totally over her.

11:04.405 --> 11:05.471
Good thing you called.

11:05.539 --> 11:07.507
She's getting ready
to go into labour -

11:07.574 --> 11:08.908
<i>but there is a problem.</i>

11:08.975 --> 11:10.576
The foal's upside down.

11:10.644 --> 11:13.646
So, unless it shifts position,
it could be a difficult birth.

11:13.713 --> 11:15.480
Is there anything
we can do?

11:15.548 --> 11:17.215
Keep a close eye
on her.

11:17.283 --> 11:21.319
And call me if the water breaks
or contractions begin.

11:21.387 --> 11:22.620
Thank you, Ty.

11:22.688 --> 11:24.189
Okay. Thanks.

11:26.092 --> 11:28.626
Hey, I wouldn't
worry about it.

11:28.694 --> 11:29.961
It's called dystocia.

11:30.029 --> 11:31.562
It's not as bad
as it sounds.

11:31.629 --> 11:33.130
Vets deal with this thing
all the time.

11:33.198 --> 11:34.198
They can change
the foal's position

11:34.266 --> 11:35.399
during labour so.

11:35.467 --> 11:39.070
Wow! You're really
taking this job seriously?

11:39.137 --> 11:40.737
Yeah, well, I applied
to a bunch of universities

11:40.805 --> 11:41.805
for pre-vet courses

11:41.873 --> 11:43.840
and I already got
two acceptances so.

11:43.908 --> 11:45.209
- No way!
- Yeah!

11:45.277 --> 11:47.243
Hey, you've come a long way
since, you know,

11:47.311 --> 11:49.079
struggling with
grade twelve algebra.

11:49.146 --> 11:50.447
I was not struggling.

11:50.514 --> 11:54.384
Oh, come on. You're talking
to your math tutor here.

11:54.452 --> 11:56.052
Ex math tutor.

12:02.926 --> 12:04.193
<i>All right, Caleb,</i>

12:04.260 --> 12:05.327
you gotta anticipate when
the steer's going to go.

12:05.395 --> 12:07.629
So you don't want
to leave too soon.

12:07.697 --> 12:09.364
<i>But you don't, you don't want
to leave too late.</i>

12:09.432 --> 12:10.632
<i>You ready?</i>

12:10.700 --> 12:11.900
Okay. Not too early.
Not too late.

12:11.968 --> 12:14.269
That just about covers it,
doesn't it, Dad?

12:14.337 --> 12:15.437
<i>Just remember,</i>

12:15.505 --> 12:17.439
when, when you get ahold
of those horns

12:17.507 --> 12:19.340
<i>okay, you just let
the steer do the work.</i>

12:19.408 --> 12:20.708
But let him push you too far.

12:20.775 --> 12:22.543
You got to really plant
your heels.

12:22.611 --> 12:24.645
Okay, Caleb,
just call it.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.209
<i>You didn't do anything
I told you.</i>

12:57.277 --> 12:58.210
<i>Were you asleep in that box?</i>

12:58.278 --> 12:59.411
<i>Huh?</i>

12:59.479 --> 13:00.812
You don't dive on the steer

13:00.880 --> 13:02.381
like a virgin
on his wedding night.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.916
You let him
pull you off.

13:06.319 --> 13:07.986
You know, I'll just-

13:08.054 --> 13:09.354
Dad!

13:09.421 --> 13:11.723
No. The kid's doing so many
things wrong, Amy,

13:11.791 --> 13:13.424
it would be a lot easier
if I just do it myself.

13:14.493 --> 13:15.761
Come on!

13:34.046 --> 13:36.047
There you go!
That's what I'm talking about!

13:36.114 --> 13:37.748
<i>Huh?!</i>

13:37.816 --> 13:39.983
Oh God, that felt good!
Hoo!

13:45.270 --> 13:46.737
<i>Yeah, he must've seen something special,</i>

13:46.805 --> 13:47.805
I mean, he came out
of retirement

13:47.873 --> 13:49.006
just to show me the ropes.

13:49.073 --> 13:50.374
You done with that?

13:50.442 --> 13:51.375
Great.

13:53.711 --> 13:56.345
You know, I ran into your mom
the other day.

13:56.414 --> 13:57.714
My mom?

13:57.782 --> 13:59.015
<i>Yeah.</i>

13:59.082 --> 13:59.883
I told her I was switching
to bulldogging.

13:59.950 --> 14:01.818
Like she'd care.

14:01.886 --> 14:02.919
That's the thing.

14:02.986 --> 14:04.353
She did seem to care

14:04.422 --> 14:05.522
and she got this look

14:05.589 --> 14:07.457
and said all this
weird stuff to me.

14:07.525 --> 14:08.558
Like what?

14:08.626 --> 14:09.925
<i>I don't know.</i>

14:09.992 --> 14:10.992
But it seemed like she was
putting her house in order,

14:11.060 --> 14:13.495
if you know what I mean.

14:15.197 --> 14:17.833
So, how's your grandpa
making out

14:17.901 --> 14:18.801
with my cattle?

14:18.868 --> 14:21.202
Well, he seems pretty happy.

14:21.270 --> 14:23.739
Actually, I think he likes
being back in the saddle again.

14:23.807 --> 14:25.440
That's good.

14:25.507 --> 14:26.641
Well, that's sorta what

14:26.708 --> 14:28.142
I wanted to talk
to you girls about.

14:28.209 --> 14:29.844
This might sound crazy...

14:29.912 --> 14:31.979
But keep an open mind.

14:32.981 --> 14:35.182
Amy, you saw me
the other day, tell Lou.

14:35.250 --> 14:36.484
After 20 years,

14:36.552 --> 14:38.252
does your old man
still have what it takes?

14:38.320 --> 14:39.821
Dad.

14:39.888 --> 14:41.322
You were great, but-

14:41.389 --> 14:43.222
Wait a minute, are you talking
about bulldogging, Dad?

14:43.290 --> 14:45.692
That gold pro-rodeo card
I got back in my glory days,

14:45.760 --> 14:47.160
it's good for life.

14:47.227 --> 14:49.362
Yeah. But Dad, your glory days
were a long time ago.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.565
Exactly, honey.

14:51.632 --> 14:53.733
I'm older,
I'm wiser.

14:55.035 --> 14:56.369
You know, me getting back
into the rodeo,

14:56.437 --> 14:58.604
is sort of like Jack getting
back to cowboying.

14:58.672 --> 15:00.906
Yeah. Except the last time
you tried to wrestle a steer,

15:00.974 --> 15:03.676
you almost killed yourself.

15:05.044 --> 15:06.345
Okay.

15:06.412 --> 15:08.113
A man gets to my age,

15:08.181 --> 15:09.982
he realizes,
he's got to make a choice.

15:10.049 --> 15:11.183
He can be...

15:11.250 --> 15:13.285
sitting around,
boring people with stories

15:13.353 --> 15:14.386
about the good old days.

15:14.454 --> 15:15.487
Or he can-

15:15.554 --> 15:18.256
Grab the bull
by the horns?

15:18.324 --> 15:19.791
That's good.

15:24.363 --> 15:25.129
God!

15:30.702 --> 15:32.836
<i>You look like
you could use a break.</i>

15:32.904 --> 15:35.506
And I could use a hand setting
up my stuff in Lou's office.

15:35.573 --> 15:36.906
What do you say?

15:36.974 --> 15:39.842
I'll give you whatever Lou's
giving you plus, five bucks?

15:39.910 --> 15:43.279
Well, zero plus five
equals five so.

15:43.881 --> 15:44.814
She doesn't pay you?

15:44.882 --> 15:46.383
<i>Tell me about it!</i>

15:46.450 --> 15:48.351
I'm working to pay off
my horse, Copper.

15:48.419 --> 15:49.652
Lou calls it
sweat equity.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.587
But it's like, I'm doing
all the sweating,

15:51.655 --> 15:53.122
and she's just keeping
the equity!

15:53.189 --> 15:55.257
Okay, well, I'm sure Lou's

15:55.325 --> 15:56.958
not trying to pull a fast one,
on you.

15:57.027 --> 16:00.195
So let's see here um,
how long you been working?

16:00.263 --> 16:02.264
About a year and a half.

16:02.332 --> 16:04.766
After school.
Weekends.

16:04.834 --> 16:06.701
And all of last summer.

16:07.303 --> 16:08.369
Um, wow!

16:10.239 --> 16:11.239
How much do you think

16:11.306 --> 16:12.873
a horse like Copper
would be worth?

16:12.941 --> 16:16.777
Well, he's kind of old
and slow so...

16:16.845 --> 16:18.746
Something like that?

16:18.813 --> 16:20.081
Oh my God!

16:22.184 --> 16:23.751
Okay, I'll be right there.

16:23.818 --> 16:24.884
Bye.

16:24.952 --> 16:26.686
Amy, I'm really sorry.

16:26.754 --> 16:27.854
I can't do the turnouts.

16:27.922 --> 16:30.057
Scott just called
from the Bailey's place.

16:30.124 --> 16:31.258
The mare's water just broke.

16:31.325 --> 16:32.426
Oh wow,
your first foal.

16:32.493 --> 16:33.593
Up close and personal.

16:33.661 --> 16:35.028
Well, you better get going.
You'll be fine.

16:35.096 --> 16:37.030
But things happen fast
once the water breaks.

16:37.098 --> 16:38.198
I'll call you.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.541
Can somebody get that?

16:50.343 --> 16:51.643
Could someone?

16:55.682 --> 16:58.550
Ah, Heartland Equestrian...
Damn it!

17:00.719 --> 17:02.753
Mallory?
Didn't you hear me?

17:05.491 --> 17:07.358
What are you doing?

17:07.425 --> 17:09.727
Nothing.
I'm on strike.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.262
Why?

17:13.330 --> 17:16.833
Funny you should ask.
I'm being exploited.

17:16.901 --> 17:18.402
Even with the deductions
for Copper's board

17:18.470 --> 17:20.869
and the exemptions
for agricultural workers...

17:20.938 --> 17:23.173
Mallory, what are you
talking about?

17:23.491 --> 17:24.958
Remember our deal?

17:25.025 --> 17:27.426
I'm supposed to work
to pay off half of Copper?

17:27.494 --> 17:28.894
Yeah.
Of course I remember.

17:28.962 --> 17:30.229
Okay.
Well, guess what.

17:30.296 --> 17:32.998
I've already paid my half
about a million times!

17:33.066 --> 17:34.233
And what makes you
think that?

17:34.300 --> 17:37.737
I went to the top.
The CEO of Bedford Oil.

17:37.804 --> 17:41.139
What? You talked to Peter
about our arrangement?

17:41.207 --> 17:42.441
Yeah. So?

17:44.877 --> 17:45.977
Oh.

17:46.044 --> 17:47.945
Are you guys
going to fight?

17:48.013 --> 17:50.281
Your first fight?
Because of me?

17:50.349 --> 17:53.885
No, Mallory.
Peter and I don't fight.

17:53.952 --> 17:55.754
We talk.
Just like me and you.

17:55.821 --> 17:59.691
And right now I'm saying
get back to work!

18:04.095 --> 18:06.430
How's it going?

18:06.498 --> 18:08.532
Scott needs some help.
Get this on.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.933
Hey, it's gonna be
all right, okay?

18:10.001 --> 18:11.268
No, it's serious,
Ty.

18:11.335 --> 18:12.269
Scott says the head

18:12.336 --> 18:15.005
and the right front leg
are stuck.

18:16.124 --> 18:18.758
You know that local
rodeo up in Longview?

18:18.825 --> 18:19.992
Longview Stampede?

18:20.060 --> 18:21.260
Came second in saddle broncs
last year.

18:21.327 --> 18:22.128
Yeah.

18:22.195 --> 18:24.063
Like I said, local.

18:24.131 --> 18:25.097
I signed us up for it.

18:25.165 --> 18:26.766
I figured we could use
the practice.

18:26.833 --> 18:28.300
Great. I mean I-

18:28.368 --> 18:29.168
I didn't think we'd be out
there that soon but-

18:29.235 --> 18:30.469
Okay,
so here's the deal:

18:30.537 --> 18:33.038
I think,
in terms of winning,

18:33.105 --> 18:34.906
it'd probably best
if I did the steer wrestling

18:34.974 --> 18:36.908
and you hazed for me.

18:36.976 --> 18:39.310
Oh... sure.
I guess.

18:39.378 --> 18:40.679
You guess?

18:40.746 --> 18:41.813
I mean,
one phone call,

18:41.881 --> 18:43.247
I'd have ten guys lined up
to haze for me.

18:43.315 --> 18:45.917
No, there's no need.
I'm your man.

18:45.985 --> 18:46.851
Good.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.407
<i>What the hell was that?!</i>

19:11.474 --> 19:12.474
<i>Where were you?</i>

19:12.542 --> 19:13.442
I don't know-
I was just doing-

19:13.510 --> 19:14.643
I'll tell ya
where you were.

19:14.712 --> 19:15.978
You were in
the wrong place.

19:16.046 --> 19:18.480
Come on!
Let's do it again.

19:19.282 --> 19:20.683
Okay.

19:42.570 --> 19:43.370
Dad!

19:44.405 --> 19:45.572
Dad, are you okay?

19:45.640 --> 19:46.907
Oh, I'd be a
hell of a lot better

19:46.975 --> 19:49.076
if he had a clue
what he was doing.

19:49.144 --> 19:50.544
Ugh!

19:50.612 --> 19:52.546
What's the idea letting the cow
wander all over the place?

19:52.614 --> 19:53.346
Sorry.

19:53.413 --> 19:55.782
Yeah. Me too.

19:55.850 --> 19:56.850
Why don't you
go get my horse?

19:56.917 --> 19:59.619
You think you can
handle that?

19:59.686 --> 20:00.854
Dad!

20:00.921 --> 20:01.988
That's a little harsh,
don't you think.

20:02.056 --> 20:03.723
He's just starting out,
the least-

20:03.791 --> 20:05.725
Please.
Come on, the guy's a real tough guy,

20:05.793 --> 20:07.360
and then it's boo hoo
when somebody tells him

20:07.427 --> 20:08.327
he screwed up?

20:08.395 --> 20:09.995
Okay, that's not
all his fault!

20:11.397 --> 20:12.264
Well lookit, if he can't
cut it in practice,

20:12.331 --> 20:13.298
what's he gonna do

20:13.366 --> 20:14.466
when there's actual
money at stake?

20:14.533 --> 20:15.934
Well, it didn't look
to me

20:16.002 --> 20:18.603
like you were actually pulling
your weight out there either.

20:18.671 --> 20:20.605
Oh, thanks, hon!

20:21.908 --> 20:25.411
Nothing like a little honest
criticism from your daughter.

20:31.116 --> 20:32.083
<i>That's a good girl.</i>

20:32.151 --> 20:33.651
<i>Easy girl.</i>

20:33.718 --> 20:35.219
<i>Good girl, Daisy.</i>

20:35.287 --> 20:37.721
<i>Easy. Easy.</i>

20:43.727 --> 20:45.162
You feel anything?

20:47.064 --> 20:48.731
No.
No movement.

20:50.434 --> 20:51.634
What?

20:51.702 --> 20:53.403
What's that mean?
What's happening?

20:53.470 --> 20:56.273
Usually, when you put your
finger in the foal's mouth,

20:56.340 --> 20:57.973
it'll suck on it.

20:58.041 --> 20:59.741
You can feel twitching,
or a bit of a shudder.

20:59.810 --> 21:00.742
But...

21:05.115 --> 21:06.816
We can't-

21:06.883 --> 21:07.749
there's got to be
something.

21:07.818 --> 21:10.619
I mean we can't
just let it...

21:12.189 --> 21:13.087
I'm sorry.

21:14.156 --> 21:15.924
The foal's gone.

21:22.097 --> 21:24.899
Ty, why don't you
take Kit out.

21:24.967 --> 21:25.934
No.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.706
Come on, Kit.
Let's go.

21:41.149 --> 21:42.249
<i>Come on.</i>

21:52.964 --> 21:53.798
<i>Hey, Bill?</i>

21:53.865 --> 21:55.999
<i>Uh, it's Scott Cardinal.</i>

21:56.067 --> 21:57.868
Yeah, I'm over
at the Bailey ranch.

21:57.936 --> 22:00.970
Yeah. One of their foals
was stillborn.

22:01.972 --> 22:03.540
I don't get it, Ty.

22:03.607 --> 22:06.042
What's, what's Scott doing?
How's my mare?

22:06.109 --> 22:07.477
Your mare's okay.

22:07.545 --> 22:08.745
Scott wants to keep
the stillborn foal

22:08.813 --> 22:10.380
in the stall with her.

22:10.448 --> 22:12.716
We tried to take it out,
but she's still protecting it.

22:12.783 --> 22:14.250
She won't let
anyone go near it.

22:14.318 --> 22:15.551
It's like she thinks
it's going to get up any minute

22:15.618 --> 22:17.052
and start to nurse...

22:17.119 --> 22:18.987
Maybe if I went in?

22:19.055 --> 22:20.856
<i>Nah. That's not a good idea.</i>

22:20.923 --> 22:22.725
But I do have a lead
on an orphaned foal

22:22.792 --> 22:25.327
that the mare
just might accept.

22:29.699 --> 22:31.833
You gonna be okay?

22:31.900 --> 22:33.634
Yeah. I guess.

22:34.703 --> 22:38.138
I mean, this kind of thing
happens all the time, right?

22:38.206 --> 22:40.040
But when it happens
to your horse though it's-

22:40.108 --> 22:42.377
I know.
It's different.

22:50.217 --> 22:52.452
See you later, guys.

22:56.056 --> 22:57.123
Mom?

22:57.191 --> 22:58.157
Hi.

22:59.994 --> 23:01.395
I got your message.

23:01.462 --> 23:02.995
Um, had to listen twice

23:03.062 --> 23:04.296
to make sure it was you,
though.

23:04.364 --> 23:06.064
Oh. Well,
it's no big deal.

23:06.132 --> 23:09.067
I just wanted to see
how you were.

23:09.135 --> 23:11.103
Can I get you something?

23:11.170 --> 23:13.406
Coffee would be nice.

23:16.109 --> 23:16.909
<i>This is frontier stuff.</i>

23:16.976 --> 23:18.676
<i>If it works.</i>

23:18.744 --> 23:20.745
<i>You're going to need some deep
pocket investors</i>

23:20.813 --> 23:22.046
<i>to develop the fields.</i>

23:22.114 --> 23:22.881
<i>Hey, what are we looking at?</i>

23:25.718 --> 23:27.485
Heartland Equestrian
Connection...

23:27.553 --> 23:29.854
Yes, we do have some
availability next month.

23:29.922 --> 23:31.456
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

23:31.524 --> 23:33.391
Sorry, can you
just keep it down a little bit?

23:33.459 --> 23:35.091
I'm in the middle
of something here.

23:35.159 --> 23:36.192
Thanks. Sorry.

23:36.260 --> 23:38.295
<i>Okay, guys.
Sorry go ahead.</i>

23:38.362 --> 23:42.466
Our rate
chart is on our website.

23:42.534 --> 23:43.667
Website.

23:48.039 --> 23:52.909
Ashley, I've been doing
a lot of thinking lately and,

23:52.976 --> 23:55.377
I might have been wrong
about your cowboy friend.

23:55.446 --> 23:57.179
Caleb?

23:57.247 --> 23:59.682
I don't really think
of him as my friend.

23:59.750 --> 24:00.750
Not since he lied to me

24:00.818 --> 24:02.885
about that money
you gave him.

24:02.953 --> 24:03.886
Yeah.

24:05.355 --> 24:07.489
Don't blame him.
It was my fault.

24:07.557 --> 24:10.892
I was the one who
paid him off to leave town.

24:10.960 --> 24:14.830
And I was also the one who
told him not to tell you.

24:14.897 --> 24:17.098
I'm really sorry
about that.

24:19.502 --> 24:21.135
He paid me back,
you know.

24:21.203 --> 24:23.370
Every single cent.

24:23.438 --> 24:26.574
He didn't say anything
about that.

24:26.641 --> 24:29.109
He's a decent young man.

24:30.111 --> 24:31.178
And maybe it isn't right

24:31.245 --> 24:32.412
that you're living
in his trailer

24:32.481 --> 24:34.882
and not paying rent.

24:34.950 --> 24:38.885
Since when did you care
about what's right?

24:40.554 --> 24:43.892
Maybe if I'd started sooner
you wouldn't have left home.

24:45.960 --> 24:49.130
Ashley, do you think you could
give me a second chance?

24:51.198 --> 24:53.132
I really miss you.

25:02.575 --> 25:04.175
There you go.

25:05.678 --> 25:07.846
Well,
his name's Merlin.

25:07.914 --> 25:10.049
Hopefully he'll be
a bit of a magician.

25:24.162 --> 25:26.363
It's okay.
These things can take time.

25:26.431 --> 25:27.564
Yeah, I guess.

25:29.233 --> 25:30.567
<i>He'll get hungry.</i>

25:30.635 --> 25:33.637
He'll smell the milk and,
hopefully, he'll go for it.

25:33.704 --> 25:35.171
And what if he doesn't?

25:35.239 --> 25:37.073
What if-
what if she doesn't let him?

25:37.141 --> 25:39.609
Well, we can't let him starve,

25:39.677 --> 25:42.711
so I'm going to leave you with
some bottles and some formula.

25:42.779 --> 25:44.547
Can you handle this?

25:44.614 --> 25:45.480
Yeah. Sure.

25:49.519 --> 25:52.655
Uh,
maybe you should stay.

25:52.722 --> 25:54.322
Are you sure
you don't need me?

25:54.390 --> 25:56.725
Check back
on you later.

25:59.327 --> 26:02.430
You know, I appreciate this,
but you don't have to.

26:02.497 --> 26:07.368
It's okay. Um, I'm just gonna
make a quick phone call.

26:13.308 --> 26:15.141
Yeah. There's definitely
some heat there.

26:15.209 --> 26:19.079
Yeah. Yeah, he worked
pretty hard yesterday.

26:19.146 --> 26:20.513
You know, I really
let him down.

26:20.582 --> 26:22.683
Not just him, either.
Your dad too.

26:22.750 --> 26:23.984
I really sucked
out there.

26:24.052 --> 26:24.985
Caleb, maybe you should
just stick

26:25.053 --> 26:25.953
with what you want,

26:26.020 --> 26:27.588
and not what my dad wants.

26:27.655 --> 26:28.689
Come on, Amy.

26:28.756 --> 26:30.423
Four time national
champion?

26:30.491 --> 26:32.992
Any cowboy would give
his right arm to haze for him.

26:33.060 --> 26:34.627
I could help you practice.

26:35.796 --> 26:36.762
Mmm.

26:39.365 --> 26:40.299
Hey.

26:42.535 --> 26:43.502
Oh.

26:44.705 --> 26:48.607
That's terrible. I-
no, that's no problem.

26:50.076 --> 26:51.375
Okay, bye.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.179
Kit's foal died.

26:55.247 --> 26:56.481
Oh, damn.

26:57.783 --> 26:58.950
She had a lot riding
on that foal.

26:59.018 --> 27:00.418
Yeah,
that's what Ty said.

27:00.486 --> 27:02.487
Is he staying
out there with her?

27:02.554 --> 27:04.622
Yeah. Yeah, they're trying
to get the mare to bond

27:04.689 --> 27:06.023
with an orphan foal.

27:06.091 --> 27:10.327
You know you got nothing
to worry about, right.

27:20.453 --> 27:23.324
He keeps trying to nurse,
but she won't let him.

27:25.392 --> 27:28.160
Ugh! I can't stand this
any more.

27:28.228 --> 27:29.161
He must be starving
by now.

27:29.229 --> 27:30.763
I think we should
bottle feed him.

27:30.830 --> 27:32.298
Just wait.

27:32.366 --> 27:35.100
She knows that her real foal
is...

27:36.402 --> 27:37.602
She doesn't want to have
anything to do

27:37.669 --> 27:39.271
with this other guy!

27:40.439 --> 27:41.672
It's going to be okay.

27:41.740 --> 27:42.941
Okay, please!

27:43.009 --> 27:44.776
Don't pretend like
you give a damn about me.

27:44.843 --> 27:46.511
I'm not pretending,
I care about you

27:46.578 --> 27:48.713
and I always have.

27:48.781 --> 27:50.348
Yeah, right.

27:50.416 --> 27:52.016
I should've known that
"we'll still be friends"

27:52.083 --> 27:55.585
is just what guys say when
they're breaking up with you.

27:55.653 --> 27:56.653
Come on!

27:56.721 --> 27:58.355
Why didn't you
tell me the truth?

28:03.228 --> 28:05.262
It took me awhile
to figure it out, Kit.

28:05.330 --> 28:08.064
Yeah, well,
you could've asked me.

28:08.132 --> 28:09.032
I would have told you.

28:09.099 --> 28:11.401
I knew before you did.

28:16.807 --> 28:20.209
Well, great end
to a great day, Lou.

28:20.277 --> 28:23.511
I gotta admit,
this working together thing?

28:23.579 --> 28:25.814
I wasn't sure,
but I was pretty impressed

28:25.881 --> 28:27.682
by the way you handled
that situation today.

28:27.750 --> 28:29.684
Well, you work
for a few years

28:29.752 --> 28:31.719
in an investment bank
in a cubicle

28:31.787 --> 28:35.057
and you learn pretty quick
how to ignore irritants.

28:35.124 --> 28:36.891
Irritants?

28:36.960 --> 28:38.927
I've been downgraded
from boyfriend to irritant now?

28:38.994 --> 28:40.694
No! Not at all.

28:42.431 --> 28:44.498
Just, you know,

28:44.566 --> 28:47.568
I mean the teleconferencing
thing that was a bit...

28:47.635 --> 28:49.036
I mean, you could
have worn headphones.

28:49.104 --> 28:50.838
You're right.
Absolutely.

28:50.905 --> 28:52.840
Um, next time, promise.

28:52.907 --> 28:54.008
'Kay.

28:54.076 --> 28:55.943
As long as you don't hum.

28:56.010 --> 28:57.945
Me hum?
Who hums?

29:02.149 --> 29:04.050
Yeah. That's it.
Does that sound familiar?

29:04.118 --> 29:06.286
Wow, I can't believe
I do that.

29:06.354 --> 29:07.087
Not just that.

29:10.257 --> 29:11.191
Okay.
You're right.

29:12.425 --> 29:13.425
I get it.

29:13.494 --> 29:15.928
So uh,
keep my day job, right?

29:15.996 --> 29:19.365
Especially if it doesn't
include labour negotiation.

29:21.234 --> 29:22.702
I'm not following.

29:22.769 --> 29:25.170
You have dozens of employees,
all around the world.

29:25.238 --> 29:26.906
I have exactly three.

29:26.974 --> 29:28.340
But all of yours
aren't enough for you,

29:28.408 --> 29:29.408
you've got to meddle
with mine!

29:29.476 --> 29:31.176
Meddle? You're talking
about Mallory?

29:31.244 --> 29:32.378
Yeah.

29:32.445 --> 29:34.013
She's your employee
but you don't even pay her!

29:34.080 --> 29:37.016
Okay. What are you,
her agent now?

29:41.921 --> 29:44.955
We're making the right
decision.

29:46.392 --> 29:49.627
Look, I don't want
to be a problem for you, Lou.

29:49.694 --> 29:52.196
You know?
Just... a solution.

29:52.264 --> 29:53.398
Sure. Yeah.

29:53.465 --> 29:55.066
I mean it's, it's crazy

29:55.134 --> 29:57.402
to let office issues
mess us up, right?

29:57.469 --> 29:58.536
- Totally.
- Yeah.

30:03.974 --> 30:05.075
So good.

30:06.544 --> 30:07.411
See you later.

30:07.478 --> 30:08.378
- Bye.
- Bye.

30:17.254 --> 30:19.055
What the hell
are you looking at?

30:21.425 --> 30:23.392
Wh-what happened
to work around here?

30:23.460 --> 30:25.694
Or is everyone
on strike now?

30:33.569 --> 30:34.135
Hep!

30:34.203 --> 30:35.603
Hep. Hip!

30:35.671 --> 30:36.637
And through that gate.

30:36.705 --> 30:38.573
Don't you go there!

30:38.640 --> 30:39.674
There you go!

30:40.742 --> 30:42.177
Catch up to your mamma.

30:42.244 --> 30:42.810
Hup! Ho!

30:48.717 --> 30:49.951
Lousy no good cow.

30:57.092 --> 30:58.859
Gotcha, you stubborn-

31:03.531 --> 31:04.731
Great!

31:05.265 --> 31:08.768
Where the hell do you think
you're going?!

31:11.972 --> 31:13.405
Have you uh,

31:13.473 --> 31:14.840
have you heard from Kit?

31:14.908 --> 31:16.075
You mean,
about the mare?

31:16.142 --> 31:18.777
Or the fact that Ty didn't
come home last night?

31:18.845 --> 31:20.713
Well both, I guess.

31:20.780 --> 31:21.880
Don't worry.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.315
Ty knows if he messes
with either of you,

31:23.382 --> 31:24.583
he's gotta answer to me.

31:24.651 --> 31:26.418
Oh, yeah right!

31:26.486 --> 31:27.685
Come on.

31:27.753 --> 31:28.853
Get going or I'm gonna
start asking you

31:28.921 --> 31:30.454
embarrassing questions
about Ashley.

31:30.522 --> 31:31.255
Fair is fair.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.825
♪

31:39.999 --> 31:42.066
Take it off Amy!

31:42.134 --> 31:43.834
<i>Whoo! Go faster!</i>

31:51.042 --> 31:52.375

<i>Grampa!</i>

32:50.310 --> 32:52.278
Hey. You okay?

32:52.345 --> 32:54.414
I got dragged off
my horse.

32:54.481 --> 32:55.314
You know, I really think
you should get some help

32:55.382 --> 32:56.282
with these cows.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.217
It's not a one man job.

32:58.285 --> 33:02.253
And you don't think
I'm the one man for the job?

33:02.321 --> 33:03.488
You know, you're like Dad

33:03.556 --> 33:05.490
trying to relive
your glory days.

33:05.558 --> 33:06.825
How about you just help me

33:06.893 --> 33:09.093
get this damn steer
through this gate?

33:18.036 --> 33:19.703
Keep your horns
to yourself.

33:19.771 --> 33:20.871
She won't let it nurse.

33:20.939 --> 33:23.441
But we still haven't fed him.

33:23.508 --> 33:26.043
Well, he's gonna
have to eat soon.

33:26.110 --> 33:28.979
Well, is there anything else
we can do to make this happen?

33:31.115 --> 33:32.549
In the old days,

33:32.616 --> 33:36.352
I would've called Amy's mom
to come and work her magic.

33:42.092 --> 33:43.259
Okay,

33:43.327 --> 33:45.161
maybe I've been
stubborn.

33:45.228 --> 33:47.664
Maybe my days as
a one man band are over.

33:47.731 --> 33:48.931
If I want
to keep this herd

33:48.998 --> 33:50.499
I'm going to need
an extra hand.

33:50.567 --> 33:52.534
Well, I could help you.

33:52.602 --> 33:55.003
You know that
I would love that.

33:55.071 --> 33:57.138
But you've been
pretty busy lately.

33:57.206 --> 33:58.607
I'm sure
I can find time-

34:03.680 --> 34:04.979
<i>Hey...</i>

34:05.046 --> 34:07.482
Yeah.
I'll be right there.

34:07.549 --> 34:08.583
I will.

34:10.652 --> 34:13.654
You go ahead.
I'll be just fine.

34:25.900 --> 34:27.868
You know, Mallory.

34:27.935 --> 34:31.170
I uh, I think I might
have let the whole

34:31.237 --> 34:34.908
"sweat equity" thing
go on a little too long.

34:34.976 --> 34:37.208
In fact, I probably
owe you some back pay.

34:37.275 --> 34:38.878
I'm willing to forget
all about that

34:38.945 --> 34:40.379
if we negotiate
a new contract

34:40.446 --> 34:42.681
from a go-forward
position.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.550
Now, who does that
sound like?

34:44.618 --> 34:46.385
Let me guess.
Peter?

34:47.453 --> 34:50.889
He has a good head
for business.

34:50.956 --> 34:52.524
I kind of miss him.

34:52.591 --> 34:53.658
Yeah, me too.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.204
Hey, Mr. Fleming?

35:08.373 --> 35:09.673
I just wanted to tell you,

35:09.741 --> 35:13.410
I've been working the whole
bulldogging deal with Amy.

35:13.477 --> 35:14.711
Well... there's a bit
of a problem.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.680
Problem?

35:16.748 --> 35:19.115
Yeah. I mean, it's going
okay with her, but-

35:19.183 --> 35:20.984
that's your problem.

35:21.052 --> 35:24.887
See, it's not enough
to be just okay at something.

35:24.955 --> 35:25.821
You gotta be the best.

35:25.889 --> 35:27.089
And from what I understand,

35:27.157 --> 35:28.223
you got the potential to be

35:28.291 --> 35:31.060
the best damn bronc
rider around.

35:31.127 --> 35:33.128
Yeah. I was thinking
that way too.

35:33.196 --> 35:34.530
It's just-

35:34.598 --> 35:35.965
well, I figure Ashley,
would just take me

35:36.033 --> 35:37.232
a whole lot more serious

35:37.300 --> 35:39.635
if I gave up broncs
for something a little safer.

35:39.703 --> 35:41.002
Oh.
Like bulldogging.

35:41.320 --> 35:43.288
Are you nuts?

35:43.355 --> 35:45.256
Bulldogging is twice
as dangerous as broncs

35:45.324 --> 35:47.859
'cause you gotta factor another
animal into the mix,

35:47.927 --> 35:49.861
you can't predict
what's gonna happen.

35:49.929 --> 35:52.030
Caleb, take it from a guy
who spent ten years recovering

35:52.097 --> 35:53.865
from one little bulldogging
accident,

35:53.933 --> 35:56.634
because the cow zigged
when it should've zagged.

35:56.702 --> 35:57.634
Yeah.

35:57.702 --> 35:58.668
Think about it.

35:58.736 --> 35:59.769
Thanks.

36:09.780 --> 36:10.613
Hey.

36:10.681 --> 36:11.448
Hey.

36:13.016 --> 36:14.750
I'm really sorry
about your foal.

36:14.818 --> 36:15.985
Yeah. Me too.

36:16.053 --> 36:18.888
He really needs
to eat.

36:23.526 --> 36:24.293
<i>How long has that blanket</i>

36:24.361 --> 36:26.028
been on the dead foal?

36:26.096 --> 36:28.097
Twelve hours.
Since I delivered it.

36:28.165 --> 36:29.297
<i>'Cause I was thinking,</i>

36:29.365 --> 36:31.099
wild horses rely
as much on smell

36:31.167 --> 36:32.467
as they do on vision.

36:32.534 --> 36:34.302
So maybe if we
take that blanket

36:34.370 --> 36:36.137
and rub it all over
new little guy,

36:36.205 --> 36:37.839
then, he'll smell enough
like her foal

36:37.907 --> 36:39.474
and she'll accept him.

36:39.541 --> 36:40.942
<i>I mean,
you have the best chance.</i>

36:41.010 --> 36:44.145
<i>It's your mare,
she trusts you.</i>

36:44.213 --> 36:46.981
Yeah, I can do it.
I can try.

36:58.726 --> 36:59.760
Easy girl.

37:09.636 --> 37:11.037
Hey, buddy.

37:13.307 --> 37:14.040
Good boy.

37:22.548 --> 37:23.681
Hey.

37:23.749 --> 37:24.682
Hey.

37:24.750 --> 37:27.719
Did you forget
something or?

37:27.787 --> 37:28.920
Ah, yeah.

37:28.987 --> 37:30.187
I forgot to tell you
not to take

37:30.255 --> 37:32.390
this whole office
thing too seriously, Lou.

37:32.458 --> 37:35.159
Well,
that's easy to say.

37:35.227 --> 37:36.828
But if you can give up
on us working together

37:36.896 --> 37:40.264
after one day,
what happens if we...

37:41.866 --> 37:42.433
What?
If we what...?

37:42.500 --> 37:43.534
If, I don't know,

37:43.601 --> 37:45.936
we live together...

37:46.003 --> 37:47.003
Or something.

37:47.071 --> 37:50.206
You know,
like a regular couple?

37:50.274 --> 37:51.942
Are you, are you just
going to pack up and leave

37:52.009 --> 37:53.811
at the first sign
of trouble?

37:53.878 --> 37:55.979
Listen,

37:56.047 --> 37:59.549
As you know
I do have some faults.

37:59.616 --> 38:02.084
I hum.
I meddle.

38:02.152 --> 38:03.853
There's actually a few
that you don't even know about

38:03.921 --> 38:06.388
to tell you the truth.

38:06.457 --> 38:09.091
But there's one thing
for sure.

38:09.159 --> 38:10.426
Come here.

38:12.562 --> 38:14.763
I'm not throwing in
the towel here.

38:14.831 --> 38:16.130
And you call me crazy,

38:16.198 --> 38:18.366
but we will never be
a regular couple

38:18.434 --> 38:21.002
because you are way too
extraordinary a woman

38:21.070 --> 38:24.973
to let a regular guy
like me drag you down.

38:36.986 --> 38:38.086
I'm here to be
honest with you, Ash.

38:38.153 --> 38:39.720
You don't have to say anything,

38:39.788 --> 38:41.589
Mom told me all about it.

38:41.656 --> 38:43.824
You know that I'm
going back to broncs?

38:43.892 --> 38:45.158
Broncs?

38:45.226 --> 38:46.926
I'm talking about
the sponsorship money.

38:46.995 --> 38:48.895
My mom told me
you paid it all back.

38:48.963 --> 38:49.662
Oh.

38:51.749 --> 38:53.182
I was planning
on telling you.

38:53.251 --> 38:54.551
I was just waiting
for the right time.

38:54.619 --> 38:56.519
And when would that be?

38:56.587 --> 38:58.321
I don't know.

38:58.389 --> 38:59.856
When you started
talking to me again.

38:59.923 --> 39:02.258
When you smiled at me.

39:03.159 --> 39:06.595
I just didn't want it
to be about the money.

39:06.663 --> 39:07.763
I was sorta hoping
you'd stop hating me

39:07.830 --> 39:10.299
all on your own.

39:10.367 --> 39:13.669
Maybe what my mom says
is true.

39:13.737 --> 39:17.672
Maybe you aren't
some no good rodeo guy.

39:17.740 --> 39:19.173
No, I'm not.

39:20.476 --> 39:21.676
And your mom, well...

39:21.744 --> 39:23.244
She ain't so bad
either.

39:23.312 --> 39:26.013
Yeah.
She has her moments.

39:26.081 --> 39:28.215
Ugh! You know,
it's not fair!

39:28.284 --> 39:30.318
What she did
is totally wrong,

39:30.386 --> 39:32.453
but the way she is now,

39:32.521 --> 39:35.455
I can't be mad
at her any more.

39:43.164 --> 39:44.331
Come on, Ty.

39:44.399 --> 39:46.767
I'll show you how to get
a bottle ready.

39:53.640 --> 39:56.074
I was really hoping
this would work.

39:58.445 --> 40:01.447
I appreciate you coming out
here and everything,

40:01.515 --> 40:03.482
I mean after...

40:03.550 --> 40:05.217
Yeah. I know.

40:05.285 --> 40:06.918
Things got a little weird
between us.

40:08.053 --> 40:10.388
But it's great about Ty,
hey?

40:10.456 --> 40:11.589
Hmm?

40:11.657 --> 40:13.858
Getting accepted
at two universities?

40:13.959 --> 40:14.659
Oh, yeah.

40:15.695 --> 40:16.628
Yeah, it is.

40:19.097 --> 40:20.965
Look at her. She just keeps
pushing him away.

40:25.002 --> 40:26.269
No, I don't think so.

40:26.338 --> 40:29.807
That's what mares do
to get foals to suckle.

40:33.911 --> 40:34.678
Wow!

40:40.183 --> 40:42.218
Wow,
look at him go.

40:47.290 --> 40:48.691
Maybe that little guy
will turn out to be

40:48.759 --> 40:50.593
the world's greatest
barrel horse, huh?

40:58.844 --> 41:01.945
By the way, the fridge stopped
working a few days ago.

41:01.948 --> 41:03.683
And that hole
in the roof?

41:03.750 --> 41:06.118
The one you
supposedly fixed?

41:06.436 --> 41:08.503
Not happening.

41:08.572 --> 41:11.339
Oh, here let me give you
a hand with that, Mrs. Stanton.

41:11.407 --> 41:12.707
Thank you.

41:13.542 --> 41:15.276
For everything.

41:21.717 --> 41:23.952
It's weird, I'm uh,

41:24.019 --> 41:26.253
really gonna
miss this place.

41:26.321 --> 41:27.888
No you're not.

41:29.791 --> 41:31.892
Now get out of here.

41:58.151 --> 42:02.087
The thing is...
I'm a bit over-extended,

42:02.154 --> 42:03.888
now that Ty's off
with Scott.

42:03.956 --> 42:06.224
<i>And we both know that Caleb's
on the rodeo circuit</i>

42:06.291 --> 42:08.326
<i>half the time and,</i>

42:08.393 --> 42:09.894
well,
truth of the matter is-

42:09.962 --> 42:12.363
You're offering me a job?

42:12.431 --> 42:13.297
Like, ranch foreman?

42:13.365 --> 42:14.666
I don't give a damn

42:14.734 --> 42:17.067
what title
you give yourself.

42:17.135 --> 42:18.836
I hate to say this,

42:18.903 --> 42:22.506
but the cattle business,
for a man your age?

42:22.573 --> 42:23.573
I could see that coming.

42:23.642 --> 42:25.609
Oh, yeah.
Well, that sounds good,

42:25.677 --> 42:26.844
coming from guy
who decided

42:26.911 --> 42:28.879
to go back to steer
wrestling.

42:28.947 --> 42:30.781
I woulda done it,
too.

42:30.849 --> 42:31.748
Except-

42:31.815 --> 42:33.382
The shoulder.

42:35.152 --> 42:36.719
Well, I could say
the same thing for myself.

42:36.787 --> 42:37.319
<i>If it wasn't-</i>

42:37.387 --> 42:39.122
Your arthritis?

42:41.091 --> 42:42.324
So if I'm gonna be foreman,

42:42.392 --> 42:43.826
we might as well move
ththe cattle back to Big River,

42:43.894 --> 42:46.195
the way things used to be.

42:46.263 --> 42:47.996
Except instead of you
paying me back,

42:48.064 --> 42:49.397
now I'm paying you.

42:49.465 --> 42:51.933
Well that's one way
of looking at it.

42:52.001 --> 42:53.268
Ah!

42:53.302 --> 42:54.469
Course if your cattle is
gonna be eating my grass,

42:54.537 --> 42:57.072
I'll have to charge you
a grazing lease.

42:57.140 --> 42:58.774
And my salary.

43:01.210 --> 43:03.545
Don't forget my salary.

43:07.183 --> 43:09.684
<i>Must have been
a couple of rough days, huh.</i>

43:09.751 --> 43:10.685
<i>Yeah.</i>

43:10.752 --> 43:11.852
Until you showed up.

43:13.522 --> 43:15.623
You were amazing.

43:15.691 --> 43:18.493
I'm not sure I'll ever get horses
the way you do.

43:20.095 --> 43:21.461
But I t think I'm starting
to understand

43:21.496 --> 43:24.298
what vets have
to go through.

43:24.365 --> 43:26.933
And I think I can
handle it.

43:27.001 --> 43:30.737
Yeah.
That's what Kit told me.

43:30.805 --> 43:33.373
She said you got accepted
to two universities.

43:35.142 --> 43:37.578
You told her,
but you didn't tell me?

43:41.981 --> 43:44.684
It's easy to tell her.

43:44.751 --> 43:45.518
It doesn't mean anything.

43:45.586 --> 43:47.786
It doesn't change anything.

43:48.655 --> 43:53.091
But telling gou
that I'm 'moving away...

43:53.192 --> 43:54.859
That we won't be
working together,

43:54.927 --> 43:55.727
that I won't get
to see you every morning

43:55.794 --> 43:58.363
that we can't be together.

44:00.766 --> 44:02.900
That's not so easy.

44:03.969 --> 44:05.770
And I guess I still don't
really know how to tell you,

44:05.838 --> 44:07.271
because I'm doing
a lousy job of it.

44:07.339 --> 44:09.173
No, you're not...

44:11.744 --> 44:14.112
You're doing just fine.

44:15.379 --> 44:16.346
Hey,

44:18.916 --> 44:21.651
we're gonna make it work,
okay?

44:23.054 --> 44:25.521
No matter what happens,
we'll get through it.
