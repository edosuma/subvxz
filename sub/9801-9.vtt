00:28.899 --> 00:29.480
Forgive me, Rico

00:29.480 --> 00:31.813
Just testing out my latest invention,

00:31.996 --> 00:33.582
It translates thoughts

00:33.582 --> 00:34.670
into action

00:35.959 --> 00:39.177
And I call it ... "The Helmet"

00:39.177 --> 00:40.819
The Helmet, really?

00:40.819 --> 00:42.602
It's a working title,
I'm totally open

00:42.602 --> 00:44.144
 to suggestion

00:44.144 --> 00:47.786
The point is, this proves
once and for all,

00:47.786 --> 00:50.167
that the intellect is
stronger than brute force.

00:50.167 --> 00:51.456
Na ah!

00:55.206 --> 00:56.930
Ah ha, interesting point, Rico

00:56.930 --> 00:58.410
However ...

01:07.558 --> 01:09.914
Calm down, don't need to squabble, boys

01:09.914 --> 01:11.493
Intellect and brute force

01:11.493 --> 01:13.205
both are important to this team.

01:13.205 --> 01:14.503
Mostly brute force.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.371
Look at me!

01:16.371 --> 01:18.631
I'm flying!

01:20.014 --> 01:21.107
Not bad!

01:21.302 --> 01:22.854
We need to do ???

01:22.854 --> 01:24.350
What else it gets for?

01:35.632 --> 01:39.178
Oh! do not get me started on his cooking ...

01:39.178 --> 01:42.907
Maurice's cooking was so bad ...

01:45.164 --> 01:46.590
How bad was it?

01:46.590 --> 01:49.210
It was so bad that I wouldn't eat it.

01:49.210 --> 01:53.203
Ha ha ha, owh, that's so funny because it's you!

01:55.741 --> 01:58.384
This ain't worth at two mangoes minimum.

01:58.384 --> 02:00.551
Oh, but seriously folks ...

02:01.912 --> 02:03.379
Now that's funny!

02:04.641 --> 02:05.806
Do it again!

02:08.502 --> 02:09.615
Nice Kowalski!

02:12.475 --> 02:14.931
That penguin has a magic crown

02:14.931 --> 02:16.596
that makes things go floating.

02:16.658 --> 02:20.972
Maurice, why does my crown not do such magic?

02:20.972 --> 02:22.695
How would you know it doesn't?

02:22.695 --> 02:24.291
Oh! Good point!

02:24.645 --> 02:27.113
Ok, fly Mort ...

02:27.113 --> 02:28.477
into the sun.

02:28.477 --> 02:29.565
Ho ho, yay!

02:32.208 --> 02:34.851
This crown is so lame!

02:39.974 --> 02:43.842
Hello, penguins, I could not help
to notice that you have a hat

02:43.842 --> 02:46.094
that magically brings things.

02:46.094 --> 02:47.852
Me want it.

02:49.745 --> 02:50.369
Kowalski

02:57.096 --> 02:58.563
I'm consumed by jealousy!

02:59.125 --> 03:00.973
I must have that magic hat.

03:08.223 --> 03:10.169
Maurice, a little more.

03:25.404 --> 03:27.627
Oh ... come ... on ...

03:43.985 --> 03:46.035
Now Maurice!

03:55.385 --> 03:57.732
The helmet! Is missing!

04:00.121 --> 04:01.811
Oh, good golly!

04:01.811 --> 04:04.620
Oh, hello! I didn't see you there.

04:04.620 --> 04:07.044
How do you like my new crown?

04:07.044 --> 04:08.845
It is quite fancy, yes?

04:08.845 --> 04:13.786
Careful! You have no idea
of the awesome power you now wield.

04:13.786 --> 04:16.194
Of course I do, that's why I took it.

04:16.194 --> 04:20.206
I'm the king, and only the King
can wield such awesome power

04:20.206 --> 04:23.272
Now watch as I wield it.

04:23.307 --> 04:26.107
I want a fizzy soda ...

04:28.702 --> 04:30.580
And ... a candy bar.

04:32.988 --> 04:35.518
And now I'm wanting a Chinese food

04:40.064 --> 04:42.294
No, real Chinese food ...

04:42.294 --> 04:43.310
from the China.

04:48.490 --> 04:50.390
Why does it's taking so long?

04:50.390 --> 04:52.444
Work crown, work!

04:52.444 --> 04:54.147
No! Not touch that!

04:54.147 --> 04:59.019
Sst! You're interrupting my concentration.

04:59.019 --> 05:00.839
Now, where is my Lon Ming?

05:00.839 --> 05:04.356
Goods coming from China does have a long way to travel.

05:04.356 --> 05:06.619
Good thought, Maurice, thank you.

05:06.619 --> 05:08.047
Also, you are fired.

05:08.047 --> 05:08.725
What?

05:08.726 --> 05:13.149
My brain and my crown will do everything for me.

05:13.857 --> 05:15.559
Yay, King Julien!

05:15.559 --> 05:17.315
Except, the worshipping.

05:17.315 --> 05:19.129
Which Mort will do.

05:19.129 --> 05:21.269
Yay, jobs of security!

05:21.269 --> 05:24.048
Ha ha, you are still here?

05:25.942 --> 05:27.667
Turn over the helmet, ringtail

05:27.667 --> 05:29.666
before someone gets hurt.

05:29.666 --> 05:31.042
Kowalski tell him.

05:31.042 --> 05:36.712
I ... I will, just as soon as I ... get
Mort hairs remove from my ... tongue ...

05:38.344 --> 05:41.680
You have no idea of the
forces you are playing.

05:44.404 --> 05:47.407
He's turned the helmet control regulator up to 10

05:47.407 --> 05:49.255
I keep it at cool 5

05:49.255 --> 05:51.952
easily enogh for my brain capacity, but ...

05:51.952 --> 05:55.706
ten is a way too much for
Julien extremely limited mind

05:55.951 --> 05:58.321
And that means what, exactly?

05:58.321 --> 06:01.858
Oh just his chaotic thought
will destroy us all!

06:01.858 --> 06:04.570
Kowalski, have you ever invented anything that

06:04.570 --> 06:07.474
that doesn't eventually threaten to destroy us all?

06:07.474 --> 06:09.044
Let me think ...

06:09.720 --> 06:10.551
No!

06:13.187 --> 06:14.615
Hm ... What next ...

06:14.615 --> 06:16.985
I know, Papaya!

06:18.493 --> 06:22.673
And dice ... see Mort, there's nothing I cannot do..

06:22.673 --> 06:24.447
You're the greatest!

06:24.447 --> 06:26.770
Except kiss up for my own ???

06:26.770 --> 06:28.067
Very good, Mort!

06:28.067 --> 06:29.635
Perfect!

06:29.635 --> 06:31.224
You begone!

06:35.113 --> 06:37.170
You're trying to steal my crown!

06:37.170 --> 06:38.732
No, it's a helmet.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.734
And yes, we are stealing it ...

06:40.734 --> 06:42.044
... Back!

06:42.044 --> 06:45.439
I am surrounded by the ??? snakes.

06:46.699 --> 06:48.698
??? go away!

06:48.698 --> 06:50.913
You must exercise caution.

06:50.913 --> 06:53.010
Whatever you think will come right to you.

06:53.010 --> 06:54.935
Your brain can't handle that kind of power!

06:54.935 --> 06:59.865
I was handling it just fine
until you came judging in here

06:59.865 --> 07:02.073
like a horde of angry rhinos!

07:05.278 --> 07:08.383
At least I didn't say like a horde of ...

07:08.383 --> 07:09.720
angry elephants.

07:09.720 --> 07:16.448
Okay, okay at least I didn't say as a city bus.

07:18.745 --> 07:21.249
Okay I see, what did there.

07:21.249 --> 07:23.056
But at least I didn't say ...

07:23.056 --> 07:23.923
Nothing!

07:23.923 --> 07:25.787
You did say nothing

07:25.787 --> 07:27.284
and did think nothing

07:27.284 --> 07:31.285
Despite Skipper's double negative,
I trust that our point was becoming clear.

07:33.450 --> 07:36.071
You know, my old crown was much less dangerous

07:36.071 --> 07:39.090
So ... why don't you take this crown off.

07:39.090 --> 07:43.898
Yes, and do so carefully because this is a particularly explosive situation.

07:43.898 --> 07:45.522
"Explosive"?

07:45.522 --> 07:47.634
Oh, heck, hit the deck!

07:49.765 --> 07:52.153
Hah, he's grabbing some good altitude.

07:52.153 --> 07:53.367
I wonder if King Julien
has realized that

07:53.367 --> 07:55.829
can he use the helmet its powers
to summon a parachute.

07:58.308 --> 07:59.340
No!

07:59.340 --> 08:01.877
Ringtail, take off that helmet ASAP.

08:01.877 --> 08:04.565
Okay, okay, I'll take it off.

08:04.565 --> 08:08.288
Heh, I mean it's not like it's chained to my head

08:09.585 --> 08:12.104
Okay, now I'm feeling the stupidness

08:12.104 --> 08:15.422
HELP!!!

08:15.422 --> 08:16.803
Let's roll!

08:21.803 --> 08:25.185
Ok ringtail, do not think of anything

08:25.185 --> 08:28.314
Except for me telling you
not to think of anything

08:28.314 --> 08:31.576
I won't. My brain will not allow no touching.

08:31.576 --> 08:34.077
My brain will be brick wall.

08:34.077 --> 08:35.438
Upsie!

08:37.047 --> 08:37.993
Rico,

08:47.644 --> 08:50.288
You know, I thought whose would look cool,

08:50.288 --> 08:51.620
and they do ...

08:55.232 --> 08:57.465
The helmet is overwhelming his brain.

09:07.745 --> 09:08.924
Retreat!

09:11.486 --> 09:13.940
Skipper, I don't see any way of penetrating

09:13.940 --> 09:15.724
that wall of telekinetic chaos.

09:16.245 --> 09:18.407
Nobody can stop Julien's brain

09:18.407 --> 09:20.551
from destroying the entire world.

09:20.709 --> 09:22.108
Look!

09:23.747 --> 09:25.892
Your highness, I am here to help.

09:27.232 --> 09:28.347
... And you are?

09:28.347 --> 09:30.304
Maurice.

09:30.304 --> 09:32.873
I used to work for you.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.858
Until recently, like this afternoon.

09:35.693 --> 09:39.535
Now that you mention it, your face does ring a bell.

09:40.233 --> 09:41.979
Oh, Maurice ...

09:42.164 --> 09:44.270
What have I done!

09:45.498 --> 09:46.230
Duck!

09:48.865 --> 09:50.002
He's distracted.

09:50.002 --> 09:50.713
This is our chance

09:50.713 --> 09:52.072
Skipper, I have a

09:52.072 --> 09:53.900
careful well thought of plan of attack

09:54.236 --> 09:55.205
Rico.

10:01.770 --> 10:04.665
Maurice, you are alive

10:04.665 --> 10:06.748
I thought I had lost you.

10:06.748 --> 10:09.172
No, but you did lose your hair.

10:09.172 --> 10:10.765
I lost my ...

10:11.815 --> 10:14.257
This is pitiesness!

10:15.233 --> 10:17.630
I'm as headless as the chimps bottom!

10:17.630 --> 10:19.951
Chill, I got it covered.

10:21.185 --> 10:25.729
Hoh, Maurice, you always know just what I need.

10:25.729 --> 10:26.799
Yup.

10:26.800 --> 10:30.415
Chinese, chinese food is here, Your Majesty.

10:30.416 --> 10:33.100
Yummy, let's chao!

10:33.101 --> 10:34.842
Well done, Rico.

10:34.843 --> 10:37.173
Good old brute force to the rescue, eh.

10:38.449 --> 10:39.872
Not in time,

10:39.872 --> 10:43.082
afterall, Skipper, it was my intellect that reason

10:43.082 --> 10:44.855
that it was time to brute force.

10:44.855 --> 10:46.903
Right, Kowalski, right ...

10:46.904 --> 10:49.352
Intellect, brute force, are equally important.

10:50.248 --> 10:52.726
Not really. Give me brute force anyday.

10:52.726 --> 10:55.639
But Skipper, doesn't violence gets more violence?

10:55.639 --> 10:57.101
Sure does, Private.

10:57.102 --> 10:58.439
It's a win-win.
