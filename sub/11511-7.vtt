00:03.268 --> 00:04.536
I don't have a choice, Shawn.

00:04.568 --> 00:05.570
We want your business.

00:05.603 --> 00:06.871
- All of it.
- <i>I'm engaged.</i>

00:06.905 --> 00:07.971
Who's the lucky fella?

00:08.005 --> 00:09.907
- His name is Jackson Brooks.
- Long way

00:09.940 --> 00:10.608
from Quitman.

00:10.642 --> 00:12.043
- Quitman?
- Shawn: <i>This dude</i>

00:12.077 --> 00:14.413

00:14.446 --> 00:15.780

00:15.814 --> 00:16.882

00:18.174 --> 00:19.050
<i>I got you.</i>

Ray: <i>Jessie here is the reason

00:25.023 --> 00:27.026
You make one mistake around Ray Carroll,

00:27.059 --> 00:28.694
<i>- he never lets you forget.</i>
- Jackson: <i>We did our time,</i>

00:28.727 --> 00:29.995
and then we got out. That is it.

00:30.027 --> 00:32.330
I am done with this lying!

00:32.363 --> 00:33.331
Just get

00:33.365 --> 00:34.433
- out!
- <i>You didn't tell me</i>

00:34.466 --> 00:36.902
you were gonna be in Austin
with Ray Carroll alone!

00:36.935 --> 00:39.405
It was last-minute.
I'm on your side, Gil.

00:39.438 --> 00:41.707
I love you, Jessie, but you have
no idea what I'm going through.

00:41.740 --> 00:43.146
If you understood, then you would stop.

and I'm not gonna just
keep calling you forever.

01:11.425 --> 01:13.004
Call me. Bye.

01:13.724 --> 01:16.542
Heard y'all hollering at
each other last night.

01:17.359 --> 01:19.936
- Sounded bad.
- None of your business.

01:20.253 --> 01:22.414
Here's some day-olds from the café.

01:22.958 --> 01:26.017
Mom,
please tell me you'll go outside today.

01:26.487 --> 01:31.122
(chuckles) I guess I'll have to,
since God forbid I smoke indoors.

01:31.154 --> 01:35.259
Anyhow,
don't beat yourself up too much, hon.

01:35.292 --> 01:38.595
The women in our family
always had trouble with men.

01:38.628 --> 01:40.197
It's not like that.

01:40.231 --> 01:42.133
Mm-hmm. What do you care

01:42.166 --> 01:43.735
about Gil, anyhow?

01:43.768 --> 01:46.204
Jackson's the one you been pining after.

01:46.237 --> 01:48.673
Mom, please, that was,
like, a million years ago.

01:48.705 --> 01:50.107
Oh, yeah?

01:50.140 --> 01:51.710
'Cause I heard you two were getting

01:51.743 --> 01:53.711
pretty friendly on his
porch the other night.

01:53.744 --> 01:55.045
Gil know you were over there?

01:55.078 --> 01:56.580
How'd you know about that?

01:56.613 --> 01:58.497
His fiancée came by, looking for you.

01:58.576 --> 02:00.230
Pretty little thing, isn't she?

02:00.270 --> 02:02.450
You know she didn't even
know Jackson went to juvie?

02:02.543 --> 02:05.756
- You told her about that?
- And she thanked me for it.

02:05.789 --> 02:08.226
Poor girl ought to know
who she's marrying.

02:08.258 --> 02:10.091
What is this, oats on a muffin?

02:10.223 --> 02:12.965
No wonder these things didn't sell.

02:14.565 --> 02:17.599
Well, I have discussed it with my board,
and we're agreed

02:17.615 --> 02:19.217
that we would like to hire your firm

02:19.333 --> 02:21.338
as our permanent outside counsel.

02:21.372 --> 02:24.107
- That's fantastic.
- You're making our job too easy, Diana.

02:24.375 --> 02:26.043
Speak for yourself.
There wasn't anything easy

02:26.077 --> 02:27.245
about it. (chuckles)

02:27.278 --> 02:29.147
You're a very lucky man, Mr. Brooks.

02:29.179 --> 02:31.048
- You have a very talented fiancée.
- Believe me,

02:31.082 --> 02:33.050
she's been out of my league
since the day we met.

02:33.083 --> 02:34.352
I'm just hoping that
she doesn't hold that

02:34.386 --> 02:37.055
- against me.
- I didn't want to jinx it,

02:37.088 --> 02:38.107
but I already put a team together.
(phone buzzes)

02:38.173 --> 02:41.159
Aaron: The best and brightest
of our associates.

02:41.191 --> 02:43.894
I'm so sorry.
Something's come up with another client,

02:43.928 --> 02:44.930
and I have to get down to the courtroom.

02:44.963 --> 02:45.930
You're leaving?

02:45.964 --> 02:47.065
It's an emergency. I apologize

02:47.097 --> 02:48.367
for the timing, Diana,

02:48.399 --> 02:49.900
but when you're on
the end of this phone,

02:49.934 --> 02:50.901
I promise you

02:50.934 --> 02:52.035
I will do the same thing.

02:52.070 --> 02:54.339
I look forward to doing business
with you. Thanks, Diana.

02:54.371 --> 02:56.041
Excuse me.

02:56.073 --> 02:57.909
I am so sorry about that.

02:57.941 --> 03:01.313
Jackson, what is going on?

03:01.684 --> 03:04.782
A multimillion-dollar
client just hired our firm.

03:04.815 --> 03:06.917
And you and Marina have it covered.
(elevator bell dings)

03:06.951 --> 03:08.953
I'm sorry. I have to go.

03:11.456 --> 03:14.326
Ooh, look at this one.
This one's not so bad.

03:14.358 --> 03:17.061
It's even got a fireplace.

03:17.095 --> 03:19.231
Really?
With that ratty-ass shag carpeting?

03:19.263 --> 03:21.165
Go ahead. Move right back to the '70s.

03:21.198 --> 03:22.299
I thought you came here to help.

03:22.333 --> 03:24.069
I'm trying.

03:24.101 --> 03:26.438
I just want what's best for
you and the baby... that's all.

03:26.470 --> 03:29.340
Boots was my brother,
and I feel a responsibility.

03:29.374 --> 03:31.309
Yeah. And I'm a grown woman, Shawn.

03:31.341 --> 03:32.247
I can take care of myself.

03:32.362 --> 03:34.047
Of course you can.
That's not what I meant.

03:34.112 --> 03:35.380
Look, Boots sat right here

03:35.412 --> 03:36.981
when he told me he
was gonna be a father.

03:37.014 --> 03:38.250
And you remember him last Thanksgiving,

03:38.282 --> 03:39.218
standing over there,

03:39.250 --> 03:42.286
making that stupid toast
about the Pilgrims?

03:43.027 --> 03:45.290
I got a lot of great
memories of him in here.

03:45.322 --> 03:47.291
- So do you.
- Yeah,

03:47.325 --> 03:49.226
and that's exactly why I need to leave.

03:49.260 --> 03:51.228
I need a fresh start,

03:51.262 --> 03:53.365
someplace that won't remind
me of everything I lost

03:53.398 --> 03:54.865
everywhere I look.

03:54.899 --> 03:56.902
Can't you understand that?

04:00.469 --> 04:03.308
I'm sorry, Jackson,
I can't believe she did that.

04:03.340 --> 04:05.243
I mean, I can because
she's my mother, but, you know...

04:05.325 --> 04:06.664
It's okay, Jessie.

04:06.744 --> 04:08.379
It was bound to come out eventually.

04:08.412 --> 04:10.047
Yeah, how'd Marina take it?

04:10.081 --> 04:13.785
Uh, well, I'm staying at a
hotel for the foreseeable future

04:13.817 --> 04:15.252
- if that's any indication.
- Oh, God, I feel terrible.

04:15.286 --> 04:17.221
Don't. It was my mistake. I...

04:17.254 --> 04:19.356
I didn't tell her about Quitman.
I don't blame her

04:19.390 --> 04:21.760
- for kicking me out.
- Yeah, well, Gil left yesterday.

04:21.791 --> 04:24.295
He's still pissed about me
volunteering for Carroll,

04:24.328 --> 04:26.297
so he blew up and stormed off.

04:26.331 --> 04:30.102
It's just... It's like being
around a land mine with him.

04:30.134 --> 04:32.103
I just don't really
know which way to step.

04:32.136 --> 04:34.405
Just give him some time,
he'll come around.

04:34.439 --> 04:36.340
Yeah, well, I hope so, but look,

04:36.374 --> 04:38.343
the reason I texted you...

04:38.376 --> 04:41.780
I was at this fund-raiser in
Austin yesterday with Carroll...

04:41.812 --> 04:43.981
- You went to Austin with him?
- Don't even get me started.

04:44.015 --> 04:45.317
The whole thing was completely surreal.

04:45.350 --> 04:48.320
There was this guy,
one of the guests, Jud Hamm.

04:48.352 --> 04:51.323
He had too much to drink,
but he implied the only reason

04:51.355 --> 04:54.058
that he was donating for Carroll
is because he had some kind

04:54.092 --> 04:57.062
of leverage over him. From 25 years ago.

04:57.095 --> 04:58.897
- That's when we were all at Quitman.
- I know. So I just...

04:58.929 --> 05:00.432
I got this really weird vibe from him,

05:00.465 --> 05:02.552
that he was trying to
warn me of something.

05:02.618 --> 05:04.535
He said,
"You make one mistake around Carroll,

05:04.569 --> 05:06.304
he never lets you forget."

05:06.336 --> 05:07.128
What kind of mistake?

05:07.194 --> 05:08.565
Well, he wouldn't say.
Carroll swooped in

05:08.632 --> 05:11.309
and pulled him off before I could ask.
But last night

05:11.342 --> 05:14.050
I pulled his donor file. Check this out.

05:14.211 --> 05:15.447
So, he owns a real estate company now,

05:15.480 --> 05:17.182
but back in the '90s,

05:17.214 --> 05:19.183
he was on the parole board with Carroll.

05:19.216 --> 05:20.118
They're hunting buddies.

05:20.151 --> 05:22.319
He's, like, some law-and-order gun nut.

05:22.353 --> 05:23.788
He's given him money every year.

05:23.822 --> 05:25.757
Even when it's not an election.

05:25.790 --> 05:28.577
This is good. This guy knows something.

05:28.693 --> 05:30.094
Yeah, I know.
So I'm gonna go meet with him

05:30.128 --> 05:32.931
in a couple hours for
lunch to see what for.

05:32.964 --> 05:33.932
Alone?

05:33.965 --> 05:35.066
Yeah.

05:35.099 --> 05:37.135
Oh, no. No.

05:37.167 --> 05:38.970
I'm coming with you.

05:39.003 --> 05:40.739
- You sure about this?
- Yeah. This is a good lead.

05:40.772 --> 05:41.907
We're gonna follow it up.

05:41.940 --> 05:43.075
I want you to go home,
drop your car off.

05:43.107 --> 05:44.075
- I'll come pick you up.
- Okay.

05:44.109 --> 05:45.077
- All right.
- All right.

05:45.109 --> 05:46.912
- See you in a bit.
- Bye.

06:00.849 --> 06:03.063
No, no, no.

06:04.070 --> 06:06.931
Mm. It doesn't make sense.

06:07.449 --> 06:09.935
They bust up my house, take out my boy,

06:09.967 --> 06:12.003
but they leave my stash behind.

06:12.037 --> 06:13.839
- You want to explain that to me?
- I wasn't

06:13.871 --> 06:16.174
even here, man.
I don't know what happened. I swear.

06:16.207 --> 06:17.776
Boy, you better start talking

06:17.808 --> 06:20.111
unless you want to end up
like your friends over there.

06:20.145 --> 06:22.180
Okay. Some-some guy came
by the corner yesterday

06:22.212 --> 06:23.648
- and wanted to talk to the boss.
- What guy?

06:23.681 --> 06:25.816
Some black guy, man.
I've never seen him before.

06:25.849 --> 06:28.085
He said he knew who took out
Cesar and Ramon last week.

06:28.119 --> 06:29.871
What's in it for him to take this place?

06:29.938 --> 06:30.681
Payback.

06:30.755 --> 06:32.057
The same guy who hit our house

06:32.090 --> 06:35.361
- killed his boy. In-in jail, I think.
- You think?

06:41.745 --> 06:44.169
That's-that's all I know, man.
I swear to God.

06:44.202 --> 06:46.038
Okay? I won't say a thing. Please.

06:46.070 --> 06:47.772
Oh, I know.

06:48.172 --> 06:50.108
'Cause if you do,

06:50.749 --> 06:53.378
they'll know you're a snitch.

06:54.118 --> 06:56.280
And they'll kill you.

06:58.843 --> 07:02.154
Give me a break. Stop crying.
Get the hell out of here.

07:02.626 --> 07:05.123
What kind of gangster are you anyway?
Go!

07:09.713 --> 07:11.362
(phone beeping)

07:13.274 --> 07:15.066
You sure that's a good idea?

07:15.356 --> 07:17.736
This is about that guy Boots.

07:18.362 --> 07:20.805
Whoever did this,
they're friends of his.

07:20.839 --> 07:22.841
(beep)

07:28.279 --> 07:30.916
(phone ringing)

07:34.248 --> 07:36.220
Get rid of that phone.

07:36.759 --> 07:39.457
Don't want anything leading back to us.

07:54.445 --> 07:55.840
Oh, my God.

07:55.873 --> 07:57.174
I may kill my mother.

07:57.207 --> 07:59.469
- What's wrong?
- She's driving me crazy.

07:59.535 --> 08:02.178
She's hassling me about Gil,
asking me about what I'm doing

08:02.277 --> 08:03.716
and where I'm going.

08:03.748 --> 08:05.516
I do not need her stress right now.

08:05.550 --> 08:08.387
I'm just, you know,
nervous about all this as is.

08:08.420 --> 08:10.856
Don't be nervous, Jessie.
You're gonna do great.

08:10.889 --> 08:14.360
- And I'm gonna be right there with you.
- I know.

08:15.641 --> 08:18.497
And don't worry about your mom.

08:18.529 --> 08:21.399
I know better than anyone
what she put you through.

08:29.824 --> 08:31.976
I'm sorry.
I know I haven't seen you in forever.

08:32.009 --> 08:34.980
- I just didn't know who to call.
- It's okay. It's okay.

08:35.013 --> 08:37.649
(indistinct shouting, glass shattering)
It's good to see you.

08:37.682 --> 08:39.851
- (sniffles)
- Are you okay? Did he hurt you?

08:39.884 --> 08:42.388
No, no.
He's just... He's been drinking all day.

08:42.421 --> 08:44.423
(grunts)

08:44.456 --> 08:46.960
(man yells)

08:47.175 --> 08:48.394
Hey.

08:49.593 --> 08:51.129
- Come here.
- (grunts)

08:51.163 --> 08:52.965
(grunting)

08:58.437 --> 08:59.471
(grunts)

08:59.504 --> 08:59.971
Stop it!

09:00.005 --> 09:01.472
Get up!

09:01.505 --> 09:03.107
Stop it, you're gonna kill him!

09:03.140 --> 09:04.543
Stop it, you're gonna kill him!

09:04.576 --> 09:05.677
Jessie: Jackson, stop! Stop!

09:05.710 --> 09:07.480
- (grunting)
- Stop now, Jackson!

Jackson! Jackson!

09:10.481 --> 09:12.116
Stop!

09:12.149 --> 09:13.117
Oh...

09:13.150 --> 09:14.419
Stop!

09:14.452 --> 09:16.356
Get out of here. Get out of here!

09:17.215 --> 09:18.324
Alice Ann: Stop...

09:18.356 --> 09:20.125
- Jackson: Don't come back.
- Mom, Mom, Mom...

09:20.158 --> 09:22.428
Don't you touch me!

09:22.461 --> 09:24.663
How dare you bring him here?!

09:24.696 --> 09:25.764
She's trying to help you.

09:25.797 --> 09:27.766
You stay out of this!

09:27.798 --> 09:29.601
Randy, baby, please.

09:29.634 --> 09:31.970
Don't go, please, don't go, come on...

09:32.003 --> 09:33.772
- Get away from me.
- (sobbing): Please don't go.

09:33.804 --> 09:35.077
(engine starts)

09:35.192 --> 09:36.875
Don't go!

09:41.779 --> 09:43.783
You see what you've done?

09:44.978 --> 09:46.952
Now he is gone!

09:46.985 --> 09:49.187
(sobbing)

09:49.221 --> 09:50.923
Come on.

09:50.956 --> 09:51.957
Let's go.

09:53.700 --> 09:56.595
Been so long since I'd seen you.

09:56.628 --> 09:59.054
I don't even know why I
called you that night.

09:59.632 --> 10:02.201
'Cause you knew I'd be there,
no questions asked.

10:02.234 --> 10:05.037
(engine starts)

10:05.070 --> 10:06.472
All right.

10:06.505 --> 10:07.472
Let's do it.

10:07.505 --> 10:09.507

- Yeah.

10:51.816 --> 10:53.886

10:53.918 --> 10:54.986
All right, people,

let's start this morning off right.

11:02.159 --> 11:05.230
Yeah! Hey, let's go, people, wake up,

let's make some damn money.

I look forward to
working with all of you.

11:14.205 --> 11:15.807
And feel free to call me anytime.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.109
Great.

11:17.141 --> 11:19.043
She is gonna be an asset,

11:19.077 --> 11:21.712
so take advantage.

11:21.745 --> 11:23.281
Just watch those billable hours, okay?

11:23.314 --> 11:24.282
(chuckles)

11:24.316 --> 11:26.018
(laughter)

11:26.051 --> 11:27.853
This is quite a team you've got here.

11:27.885 --> 11:29.620
Yeah, they're family.

11:29.654 --> 11:31.590
A needy, dysfunctional family.

11:31.623 --> 11:33.325
But that's why we get sued a lot.

11:33.357 --> 11:35.793
Good for me, I guess.

11:35.827 --> 11:38.230
- Who is this?
- My father.

11:38.263 --> 11:41.133
He started this company from the
kitchen table at his parents'

11:41.165 --> 11:43.134
little dairy farm all the
way out in Blessing, Texas.

11:43.168 --> 11:45.169
And he always said "Family comes first."

11:45.202 --> 11:47.139
And to him that meant all his employees.

11:47.172 --> 11:49.274
Sounds like you had big shoes to fill.

11:49.307 --> 11:51.176
He died just a few
years after I graduated

11:51.208 --> 11:53.277
from business school.

11:53.311 --> 11:55.113
Was very sudden.

11:55.145 --> 11:57.048
And it was a big responsibility

11:57.082 --> 11:59.717
for me to take over.

11:59.750 --> 12:02.120
But the memories that I
have of him and everything

12:02.153 --> 12:05.923
that he taught me...
that is still my greatest motivation.

12:05.957 --> 12:08.593
- He looks like a very intelligent man.
- He was.

12:08.626 --> 12:10.161
And he told me that all the time.

12:10.195 --> 12:11.964
- (chuckles)
- Well, I think

12:11.996 --> 12:13.298
that we have earned our lunch,

12:13.331 --> 12:14.332
don't you? Come on.

12:14.365 --> 12:15.766
I made us a reservation.

12:15.799 --> 12:17.000
Oh, great.

12:17.034 --> 12:19.170
Shawn: Thank God.
I-I'm just trying to be a team player.

12:19.203 --> 12:20.237
Annie: (laughs) Okay.

12:20.270 --> 12:22.106
I'm gonna go grab the diapers.

12:22.139 --> 12:23.174
Okay. You know, I'm gonna
drive the baby around

12:23.207 --> 12:24.308
so he's not fussing.

12:24.341 --> 12:25.711
- Yeah, good.
- Okay.

12:25.744 --> 12:27.045
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

12:27.077 --> 12:28.713
Hey, little man.
So, what do you want to listen to?

12:28.746 --> 12:32.351
Little classical, jazz, some hip-hop?

12:32.384 --> 12:35.187
All right, we'll go with some jazz.

12:35.220 --> 12:37.221
(jazz music starts playing)

12:40.290 --> 12:41.593
(siren chirps)

12:53.622 --> 12:55.039
You know why I pulled you over?

12:55.072 --> 12:57.042
No, I don't, Officer.

12:57.075 --> 12:58.310
You exited through an entry.

12:58.342 --> 12:59.877
One way into that parking lot.

12:59.910 --> 13:01.279
What? I didn't see any sign.

13:01.312 --> 13:03.281
License and registration, please.

13:03.313 --> 13:04.382
(sighs)

13:07.351 --> 13:08.819
It's my friend's car.

13:08.852 --> 13:10.021
Mm-hmm.

13:10.054 --> 13:11.822
Whose baby is that, sir?

13:11.856 --> 13:13.057
It's my friend's son.

13:13.091 --> 13:14.926
I just dropped her off
at the grocery store

13:14.958 --> 13:16.794
to get some diapers.

13:16.827 --> 13:18.429
Where's the baby's father at?

13:18.462 --> 13:19.831
How's that relevant?

13:19.864 --> 13:21.298
You're driving a car

13:21.332 --> 13:23.235
that's not in your name with
a baby that ain't yours.

13:23.268 --> 13:25.137
Think that gives me enough
cause for suspicion.

13:25.169 --> 13:27.072
What, you think,
just 'cause I'm black, I go around

13:27.105 --> 13:28.774
stealing white people's babies and cars?

13:28.807 --> 13:30.442
I'm gonna ask you to step out
of the vehicle, please, sir.

13:30.475 --> 13:32.444
No, I'm not stepping out of the car.
The baby

13:32.476 --> 13:34.446
- needs his pacifier.
- Hands where I can see 'em!

13:34.479 --> 13:36.348
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Out of the car. Now.

13:36.380 --> 13:37.815
All right, all right, all right.

13:37.849 --> 13:39.151
I'm get... I'm getting out.

13:39.183 --> 13:41.318
I'm getting out. Whoa...

13:41.351 --> 13:43.288
- (grunts)
- You're under arrest.

13:43.321 --> 13:44.822
- What?
- Stop resisting!

13:44.856 --> 13:46.124
- I-I'm not resisting.
- Stop resisting!

13:46.157 --> 13:48.293
I'm not resisting.
Sir, I'm not resisting.

13:48.326 --> 13:49.428
- Stop resisting!
- I'm not resisting.

13:49.461 --> 13:51.730
- (handcuffs clicking)
- Aah, aah!

13:55.265 --> 13:56.396
(indistinct conversations)

13:56.536 --> 13:58.604
I'm sorry, he's not in his office.

13:58.637 --> 14:00.773
All I can do is take a message.

14:00.806 --> 14:02.474
It's a client,

14:02.507 --> 14:04.576
- he says it's an emergency.
- Where's Jackson?

14:04.609 --> 14:06.745
He's not answering his cell.
This guy's pretty upset.

14:06.778 --> 14:08.013
Which client is it?

14:08.046 --> 14:09.782
Someone named Shawn Cook.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.153
Put him through to my office.

14:19.291 --> 14:21.060
Shawn, it's Marina.

14:21.093 --> 14:22.862
And on Saturday Mr. Carroll's
hosting a roundtable

14:22.895 --> 14:24.497
at The Tower Club for the
state delegate convention,

14:24.530 --> 14:25.765
so I would love to get you

14:25.797 --> 14:28.600
- some VIP passes.
- Well, thank you, but I just

14:28.633 --> 14:31.036
don't have the energy level
I used to for these things.

14:31.070 --> 14:32.504
Send my regrets to Ray.

14:32.537 --> 14:33.858
Mm-hmm.

14:35.163 --> 14:38.511
So you said you knew Mr.
Carroll for 25 years?

14:38.543 --> 14:40.846
Was that back when he was
still the warden at, um,

14:40.879 --> 14:42.481
oh, what was that place called?

14:42.960 --> 14:44.447
Oh, Quitman.

14:45.703 --> 14:47.921
Ms. West, why are you really here?

14:47.954 --> 14:51.458
Because I know this has nothing
to do with campaign cookouts

14:51.490 --> 14:54.593
or roundtable meet and greets.

14:54.627 --> 14:55.862
Ray wouldn't waste your talents on that.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.464
I'm not sure what you mean.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.599
I'm guessing he saw me
overserved the other night.

15:00.632 --> 15:02.734
So now he wants to make
sure I stay in line.

15:02.767 --> 15:05.872
Well,
I wrote my check just like I always do.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.541
- I don't want any trouble.
- I think you have the wrong idea here.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.611
And I have to say...
you're not the type I'd expect

15:11.643 --> 15:14.113
- to be doing Ray's dirty work.
- Dirty work?

15:14.146 --> 15:15.748
I'm sorry, is there something I should

15:15.781 --> 15:17.750
know here about Mr. Carroll?

15:17.782 --> 15:20.052
You must have noticed that Ray has

15:20.085 --> 15:22.589
a lot of powerful friends in this state.

15:22.622 --> 15:23.957
People in his pocket.

15:23.989 --> 15:25.892
Yeah, but doesn't every politician?

15:25.925 --> 15:27.594
Not like this.

15:28.984 --> 15:30.619
I'm sorry.

15:30.801 --> 15:32.503
I really need to be going.

15:32.817 --> 15:34.386
Thank you for the steak.

15:47.580 --> 15:48.614
What happened?

15:48.647 --> 15:51.250
I got nothing.
He thinks Carroll sent me to spy here.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.251
- About what?
- I don't know.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.087
He was talking about all
the people Carroll had

15:54.119 --> 15:55.287
under his thumb and then

15:55.320 --> 15:57.657
he just got spooked and took off,
didn't even finish his lunch.

15:57.690 --> 15:58.858
- Ma'am.
- Yeah?

15:58.891 --> 16:00.193
Gentleman outside paid for you parking.

16:00.225 --> 16:02.294
Said, "Have a nice day."

16:02.328 --> 16:04.097
- Did you valet the car?
- No.

16:07.632 --> 16:09.602
What the hell is Wayside Ranch?

16:09.634 --> 16:11.270
I have no idea.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.974
- Let's go.
- Okay.

16:19.210 --> 16:21.714
Excuse me. My client is being
detained here unlawfully.

16:21.747 --> 16:23.583
I need to speak to the
commanding officer.

16:23.615 --> 16:25.784
- Leland's still at lunch.
- I'll do this myself.

16:25.817 --> 16:26.752
Oh... Wait, excuse me?

16:26.786 --> 16:29.222
Ma'am... Ma'am. Excuse me.

16:29.254 --> 16:30.556
Hey, Shawn.

16:30.589 --> 16:32.157
Hey, Marina.

16:32.190 --> 16:34.093
You got to be kidding me.

16:34.126 --> 16:36.229
We're gonna photograph these injuries.

16:36.262 --> 16:37.796
I appreciate you coming down.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.599
Excuse me.

16:39.632 --> 16:41.004
What seems to be the problem here?

16:41.103 --> 16:43.202
The problem is my client was arrested

16:43.234 --> 16:44.336
on completely made-up charges.

16:44.369 --> 16:45.804
I want him released.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.272
He's gonna have to wait
for the arraignment,

16:47.306 --> 16:49.129
just like everybody else.

16:49.261 --> 16:51.878
So you're gonna allow this
man to sit in jail, bleeding,

16:51.911 --> 16:54.881
in a police department well
known for the misuse of force

16:54.913 --> 16:57.349
at a time when millions of
Americans are paying attention

16:57.382 --> 17:00.753
to the way white officers
are treating black civilians?

17:00.786 --> 17:02.321
Ma'am, this isn't a racial issue.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.857
Oh, no?

17:05.240 --> 17:07.159
I'm gonna subpoena the dash-cam footage.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.627
We'll let the public decide
what kind of issue this is.

17:09.662 --> 17:12.298
So, either way, this is gonna
blow up into a media nightmare

17:12.329 --> 17:14.333
for this department
and this entire town,

17:14.367 --> 17:16.300
so either you can sit
back and let that happen,

17:16.335 --> 17:19.372
or you can release my client
and drop these charges.

17:19.405 --> 17:21.174
Now.

17:21.205 --> 17:23.208
("Love My Way"
by the Psychedelic Furs playing)

17:25.836 --> 17:27.780
Do you have a question
about your future, sweetie?

17:27.811 --> 17:29.681
Where you're headed?

17:29.714 --> 17:31.350
Uh,
I was just headed to get some nachos,

17:31.384 --> 17:32.785
maybe play a little keno.

17:32.818 --> 17:34.253
Why?

17:34.285 --> 17:36.089
Okay.

17:40.044 --> 17:40.693
Hmm.

17:40.725 --> 17:41.694
(clears throat)

17:41.726 --> 17:42.695
The devil.

17:42.727 --> 17:44.630
Ah. Nice.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.099
Although, I got to say,
you're not the first woman

17:46.131 --> 17:47.633
to accuse me of that.

17:47.666 --> 17:48.967
Well,
the first card represents your past.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.304
This is telling me
that you suffered badly

17:51.337 --> 17:54.307
because of something
out of your control,

17:54.339 --> 17:56.876
and you're haunted by it even today.

17:58.463 --> 18:00.646
Wait, it says all that right there?

18:00.679 --> 18:01.680
Mm-hmm.

18:01.714 --> 18:02.682
Second card.

18:02.714 --> 18:04.050
That's your present.

18:04.082 --> 18:05.051
Where you are now.

18:05.083 --> 18:06.051
The hermit.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.186
You're alone.

18:07.218 --> 18:08.654
Other people don't understand you.

18:08.687 --> 18:11.157
You have to carry your
burdens on your own.

18:11.189 --> 18:14.080
Third card represents
your future destiny.

18:14.807 --> 18:16.145
Um...

18:16.806 --> 18:18.130
Sweetheart, this is not good.

18:18.164 --> 18:20.166
So basically I'm screwed, right?

18:20.198 --> 18:21.927
I knew it.

18:22.489 --> 18:23.703
My life sucks.

18:23.735 --> 18:27.272
My girlfriend's pissed at me.

18:27.305 --> 18:29.308
It's all just destiny, though, right?

18:32.343 --> 18:34.312
Hey, come have a drink with me.

18:34.346 --> 18:36.115
I mean, if I'm gonna go down in flames,

18:36.147 --> 18:37.783
I might as well live it up now, right?

18:37.817 --> 18:39.886
Oh, it won't be flames;
it's worse than that.

18:39.918 --> 18:42.754
I'll give you $500 to come
have a drink with me right now.

18:42.788 --> 18:43.823
I'm flattered,

18:43.856 --> 18:45.758
but, uh, those kind of girls,
they work outside.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.092
Third and Bay Street.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.761
Uh,
this is not gonna be that kind of party.

18:48.793 --> 18:50.429
I just... I just want to hang out.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.697
How about a thousand?

18:53.051 --> 18:53.861
$1,500?

18:53.960 --> 18:55.397
(scoffs)

18:55.612 --> 18:57.737
All right, look.

18:57.770 --> 19:01.041
Here's $2,000, cash.

19:05.043 --> 19:06.344
I will get my purse.

19:06.378 --> 19:07.879
Jessie: Okay, so we're gonna ta...

19:07.913 --> 19:08.948
uh, merge onto the...

19:08.981 --> 19:11.818
Stay left, merge onto the 59 north,

19:11.850 --> 19:13.886
and we're gonna go all
the way up to the 1961.

19:13.918 --> 19:15.887
My God, this place is a haul.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.889
Wait, you said...
you said left or right?

19:17.923 --> 19:19.224
Just go left.

19:19.258 --> 19:20.460
- Left?
- No, no, no, no, no.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.860
- Right?
- Right, right, right, right.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.347
- (laughing): Sorry.
- (car honks)

19:23.760 --> 19:25.397
Jackson: <i>Sorry.</i>

19:26.765 --> 19:28.734
That's all right...
when we wind up in Tallahassee,

19:28.768 --> 19:30.069
I'll know who to blame.

19:30.101 --> 19:31.737
Hey, I got us the address.

19:31.771 --> 19:34.072
You got to...
you got to get us to the door.

19:34.106 --> 19:35.407
(chuckles)

19:35.441 --> 19:36.743
What's wrong with Tallahassee?

19:36.775 --> 19:38.744
Never been there before.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.748
That's right,
we never took that road trip, did we?

19:41.781 --> 19:44.117
No, we never did.

19:48.920 --> 19:51.224
So how pissed off do you
think your mom's gonna be?

19:51.256 --> 19:53.225
Who cares? Randy had it coming.

19:54.221 --> 19:56.496
Besides, this is awesome.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.198
God,
I wish we could stay like this forever.

20:00.516 --> 20:02.535
Why can't we?

20:02.568 --> 20:03.669
Yeah?

20:03.703 --> 20:06.205
I'll quit my job,
we just go driving across the country.

20:06.237 --> 20:08.507
We can go... Where do you want to go?

20:08.541 --> 20:10.810
California.

20:10.842 --> 20:11.944
California.

20:11.976 --> 20:13.780
Mm-hmm.

20:13.812 --> 20:15.782
California it is.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.787
- Jackson: Where are we going?
- Jessie: California.

20:20.820 --> 20:21.721
- Where are we going?
- California!

20:21.754 --> 20:23.089
- California! Come on!
- (screaming): California!

20:27.158 --> 20:28.794
I'm sick of you and your damn plans.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.128
Yesterday, you call me

20:30.162 --> 20:31.464
one hour before my train's coming in,

20:31.496 --> 20:32.931
you tell me to divert my shipment.

20:32.964 --> 20:34.801
Next thing I know,
DEA's all over my ass.

20:34.833 --> 20:36.268
Just relax, they didn't find anything.

20:36.301 --> 20:37.837
I'm under attack here, Warden.

20:37.869 --> 20:40.973
Somebody hit my stash
house and took out my boy.

20:41.005 --> 20:43.008
Terry,
what goes on between you and your rivals

20:43.041 --> 20:44.342
is not my concern.

20:44.376 --> 20:46.012
This wasn't some rival gang, a'ight?

20:46.044 --> 20:47.946
I'm smarter than that.

20:47.980 --> 20:51.317
Now, I'm asking you...
who called the feds?

20:51.349 --> 20:53.319
It was Jackson Brooks.

20:53.351 --> 20:54.986
That coward-ass son of a bitch...

20:55.020 --> 20:56.321
Listen to me.

20:56.355 --> 20:58.324
I've got him taken care of.

20:58.357 --> 21:00.575
I'm gonna be discussing our
options later on tonight.

21:00.657 --> 21:02.460
So I don't need you losing your temper.

21:02.493 --> 21:03.596
I'm losing my temper.

21:03.628 --> 21:06.131
Jackson is not a common street thug.

21:06.165 --> 21:07.465
You can't just haul off...

21:07.499 --> 21:08.601
I don't care who he is.

21:08.634 --> 21:10.503
I'm tired of waiting around on you.

21:12.713 --> 21:14.150
I'm-a handle it myself.

21:14.282 --> 21:15.604
Terry.

21:17.999 --> 21:19.846
Don't touch me.

21:27.087 --> 21:29.812
- (knocking)
- All right!

21:31.957 --> 21:33.392
I was right.

21:33.426 --> 21:34.860
- They're starting a war.
- What?

21:34.893 --> 21:37.163
Yeah, those Quitman boys,
Jackson Brooks...

21:37.197 --> 21:38.665
he tipped the DEA to one of my shipments

21:38.697 --> 21:39.932
and I damn near lost it.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.935
I need somewhere to store my product.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.402
Terry, this is a house of God.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.172
This ain't some damn crack den.

21:45.205 --> 21:46.306
Exactly.

21:46.340 --> 21:48.183
Ain't nobody going to be
looking for anything in here.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.777
No, no.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.077
No way.

21:51.111 --> 21:52.912
- T...
- Let's go. Let's go.

21:52.945 --> 21:55.071
This isn't a request, little brother.

21:55.187 --> 21:57.251
- Let's go.
- I am not going back to prison for you.

21:57.284 --> 21:58.451
Nor am I losing my job.

21:58.485 --> 21:59.987
Have you lost your damn mind?

22:00.019 --> 22:01.355
Dennis!

22:01.387 --> 22:02.955
Hey, look.

22:02.989 --> 22:06.527
Those boys... they set up
Dooley and they got him killed.

22:06.559 --> 22:07.927
And they might be coming for you, too.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.195
Now, I'm gonna handle it,

22:09.229 --> 22:10.497
but if you want me to watch your back,

22:10.529 --> 22:11.898
- I need you to watch mine.
- Watch your...?

22:11.932 --> 22:14.034
Just be easy.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.836
It's just temporary.

22:17.971 --> 22:19.439
It'd better be.

22:20.499 --> 22:21.941
Annie: <i>It's outrageous.</i>

22:21.974 --> 22:24.010
I just hope you put the
fear of God into those cops.

22:24.044 --> 22:25.245
It is what it is.

22:25.278 --> 22:26.380
Thanks again, Marina.

22:26.412 --> 22:27.413
I'm sure you had better things to do

22:27.447 --> 22:28.582
than get my ass out of jail.

22:28.614 --> 22:31.116
Well, your ass didn't belong in jail.

22:31.611 --> 22:34.419
Besides, yelling at people
is the best part of my job.

22:34.552 --> 22:35.989
This little guy's getting so big, Annie.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.490
(chuckles)

22:37.524 --> 22:39.493
Ooh! Stinky, too.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.161
Think he's trying to impress you.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.528
Excuse us.

22:42.562 --> 22:45.199
Oh, come here, you stinky boy.

22:45.231 --> 22:47.100
Come here, come on.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.374
I need to tell you...

22:56.431 --> 22:58.380
I know about Quitman.

23:00.660 --> 23:01.915
Jackson told you?

23:02.014 --> 23:03.083
No.

23:03.115 --> 23:04.518
I found out.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.619
And I asked him about it.

23:06.653 --> 23:07.621
He wouldn't talk.

23:07.653 --> 23:08.622
Turned into a fight.

23:08.654 --> 23:11.057
I need to know what's
going on with you guys.

23:11.091 --> 23:12.978
(sighs) Sorry, Marina.

23:13.060 --> 23:15.026
I can't get between you and Jackson.

23:25.037 --> 23:27.406
I just feel like I don't
even know who he is anymore.

23:27.440 --> 23:28.542
He's a good man.

23:28.575 --> 23:29.576
I can tell you that.

23:30.090 --> 23:31.857
As far as Quitman goes,

23:31.989 --> 23:33.512
still got my own questions.

23:33.546 --> 23:34.914
What do you mean?
What kind of questions?

23:34.948 --> 23:36.416
Forget it.

23:36.449 --> 23:38.051
All right, I...

23:38.583 --> 23:40.053
All I'm saying is,
sometimes you got to learn

23:40.085 --> 23:42.489
to live life without
having all the answers.

23:42.521 --> 23:44.258
Well, I can't accept that.

23:45.357 --> 23:48.595
Honestly, you shouldn't either.

23:54.267 --> 23:56.636
I feel like I owe you an apology.

23:57.648 --> 23:59.072
What for?

23:59.105 --> 24:00.473
When you came to get me
after the whole thing

24:00.507 --> 24:03.043
with my mom's boyfriend, I just...

24:03.076 --> 24:05.045
I shouldn't have forced the issue...

24:05.077 --> 24:06.212
at Quitman.

24:06.246 --> 24:07.614
Jessie, that was not your fault.

24:07.646 --> 24:09.383
We were just having so much fun.

24:09.415 --> 24:10.683
And you went to this
really dark place and...

24:10.717 --> 24:12.185
Yeah, because I was a mess back then.

24:12.218 --> 24:13.452
But I didn't know.

24:14.298 --> 24:16.522
And after seeing the tape
and everything you went through,

24:16.556 --> 24:18.558
I just wish I would've left it alone.

24:24.663 --> 24:25.531
Randy...

24:25.565 --> 24:28.501
Randy did that to you?!

24:30.794 --> 24:32.373
(groans)

24:33.867 --> 24:35.374
What is wrong with you?!

24:35.408 --> 24:37.611
(grunts)

24:39.213 --> 24:40.279
I'm sorry.

24:40.313 --> 24:42.649
No, I'm so... I'm sorry.

24:42.682 --> 24:44.218
It's okay. Oh, my God.

24:45.903 --> 24:48.321
What happened to you?

24:49.092 --> 24:51.520
What happened to you?

24:53.625 --> 24:54.994
What, wa...?

24:55.028 --> 24:57.030
Was it Quitman?

24:59.739 --> 25:00.614
Was it?

25:00.746 --> 25:03.403
It's nothing.

25:03.435 --> 25:05.071
I'm gonna get you out of here.

25:05.105 --> 25:06.139
- Come on.
- No.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.098
You got to trust me.

25:08.610 --> 25:10.790
I know it's hard,
but you need to talk about it.

25:10.923 --> 25:11.745
I can't.

25:11.778 --> 25:13.346
Jessie: <i>Jackson, whatever happened here,</i>

25:13.380 --> 25:15.582
<i>it's okay, you can tell me.</i>

25:15.614 --> 25:18.518
You got to get it out of your system.

25:23.633 --> 25:24.992
Unbelievable.

25:25.879 --> 25:26.759
It's Red.

25:26.793 --> 25:29.629
He still works here.

25:29.662 --> 25:31.664
(groans)

25:35.501 --> 25:36.702
What, Jackson? What's going on?

25:36.736 --> 25:38.472
What are you doing?

25:38.505 --> 25:39.606
Is that a gun?

25:39.639 --> 25:41.508
- Wait here.
- Jackson!

25:55.622 --> 25:56.623
(gasps)

25:58.343 --> 26:00.457
Jessie: Oh, my God.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.606
I'm sorry.

26:14.362 --> 26:15.575
If I hadn't pushed you to talk,

26:15.607 --> 26:17.743
we would've never ended up out there.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.779
Nobody made me grab that gun.

26:22.315 --> 26:25.426
And if I'd just opened
up to you right then,

26:25.509 --> 26:28.218
who knows how this would've turned out?

26:30.514 --> 26:33.027
I really missed you, you know?

26:34.386 --> 26:36.396
I missed you, too.

26:43.569 --> 26:46.306
♪ Come on and do what
you came to do... ♪

26:46.338 --> 26:47.573
(both groan)

26:48.164 --> 26:49.188
This is awesome.

26:49.287 --> 26:51.411
I've never gone boozin'
with a psychic before.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.578
Oh, I'm not a psychic.

26:52.612 --> 26:53.814
I'm an intuitive.

26:53.846 --> 26:55.081
What's the difference?

26:55.114 --> 26:56.549
Well, I read energy.

26:56.583 --> 26:58.618
You know, I channel the
subconscious to help people

26:58.651 --> 26:59.518
on their journeys.

26:59.551 --> 27:01.554
(both laugh)

27:03.189 --> 27:05.725
All right,
wh-what-what's her energy tell you?

27:05.758 --> 27:08.562
Um, desperation.

27:08.595 --> 27:12.391
She probably hasn't been laid
since Clinton was president.

27:12.688 --> 27:15.367
Well, how...
what would you tell someone about me?

27:15.401 --> 27:17.537
No, okay, look, say there was a girl

27:17.569 --> 27:20.439
who was willing to take
a chance on my ass.

27:20.472 --> 27:23.738
(stammers) Is-is there someone

27:24.036 --> 27:26.282
maybe that can fix me?

27:28.331 --> 27:30.032
She'd be a fool for trying.

27:30.165 --> 27:33.520
I mean, no offense,
but I think you're a little past fixing.

27:36.260 --> 27:38.705
What are you running from, Gil?

27:46.621 --> 27:48.168
Wow, whose place is this?

27:48.201 --> 27:49.536
I don't know, but I doubt

27:49.568 --> 27:51.570
they're gonna want us snooping around.

27:51.604 --> 27:53.306
So, what do we do?

27:53.338 --> 27:55.741
We snoop around.

28:20.113 --> 28:22.112
Ooh, ooh. Get back, back.

28:24.342 --> 28:25.505
Jessie: Oh, my God.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.774
This is his place.

28:35.037 --> 28:37.351
(groans)

28:38.550 --> 28:40.553
We got to move... come on, come on.

28:49.202 --> 28:50.832
Waylon, how was the hunt?

28:54.588 --> 28:56.770
Well,
not as many birds 'cause of the drought.

28:56.804 --> 28:58.406
But I reckon I did okay.

28:58.439 --> 29:00.452
Ray: Well, I wish I could've joined you.

29:00.535 --> 29:03.076
Tell Essie there's, uh,
steaks in the freezer

29:03.110 --> 29:04.612
if you need them.

29:04.644 --> 29:06.146
It's gonna be the regular group.

29:06.180 --> 29:08.149
Waylon: All right.

29:08.699 --> 29:10.384
(grunts)

29:16.827 --> 29:19.443
Waylon,
you haven't seen my special humidor

29:19.526 --> 29:20.660
lying around, have you?

29:20.693 --> 29:23.897
I could've sworn I left
my Pádrons in here.

29:23.930 --> 29:24.998
Waylon: Right here.

29:25.032 --> 29:26.833
Yeah, it's right here.

29:26.866 --> 29:29.736
I tucked it out of the way so
Mrs. Carroll wouldn't find it.

29:29.769 --> 29:31.932
I know how she gets on your case.

29:32.130 --> 29:34.074
Ray: You're a good man.

29:35.446 --> 29:37.010
We're all entitled to a few vices

29:37.044 --> 29:38.545
now and then, aren't we?

29:38.578 --> 29:39.846
Waylon: Yes, sir.

29:39.880 --> 29:42.149
Ray: Now, you get those
birds cleaned up for supper.

29:42.181 --> 29:43.884
I'm gonna head in.

29:47.258 --> 29:48.923
(door closes)

30:17.431 --> 30:19.810
Now they're heading back to the house.

30:21.787 --> 30:24.123
You see when he opened this?
It's filled with files,

30:24.157 --> 30:26.093
photo negatives, film canisters.

30:26.125 --> 30:27.894
Well, it's not like he's keeping
his family portraits in it.

30:27.928 --> 30:28.996
No, exactly, this...

30:29.028 --> 30:31.064
No one uses film.
This has got to be old.

30:31.097 --> 30:32.866
Like Quitman old?

30:32.900 --> 30:33.833
We got to get out of here.

30:33.866 --> 30:35.935
Come on, it's not opening now.

30:35.968 --> 30:37.872
Jackson, we got to get out of here.

30:37.904 --> 30:40.074
Jackson, come on.

30:54.621 --> 30:56.482
Do you know these people?

30:57.044 --> 30:57.690
No.

30:57.724 --> 30:59.226
Must be his inner circle.

30:59.258 --> 31:00.794
We have to get closer.

31:00.826 --> 31:02.829
Come on.

31:23.926 --> 31:25.958
Check out that license plate.

31:26.189 --> 31:27.626
Jessie: What about it?

31:27.758 --> 31:29.722
Jackson: He's a federal judge.

31:29.756 --> 31:32.293
Probably retired, but still.

31:35.676 --> 31:37.931
We got to see who else is here, come on.

31:46.840 --> 31:48.042
Amy.

31:48.898 --> 31:50.567
- Wait.
- Shawn, I told you.

31:50.682 --> 31:52.045
I don't want to have
anything to do with this.

31:52.078 --> 31:54.366
Listen, just... I got to know.

31:54.598 --> 31:56.650
All those kids at Quitman...

31:56.682 --> 31:59.353
why did you save me?

31:59.385 --> 32:00.920
(sighs)

32:02.048 --> 32:03.690
I saw a lot of kids at Quitman,

32:03.724 --> 32:06.727
hard from being in that place,
but not you.

32:06.759 --> 32:08.828
You were just this sweet,
goofy little boy

32:08.862 --> 32:10.163
trying to get through it.

32:10.197 --> 32:12.399
But you're stronger than you realize.

32:12.581 --> 32:14.668
I didn't save you, Shawn.
You saved yourself.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.370
The night Petey disappeared,

32:16.402 --> 32:18.005
you saw the warden get in the van, too.

32:18.037 --> 32:19.872
Why didn't you tell us?

32:19.905 --> 32:21.874
You working for this man?
You protecting him?

32:21.908 --> 32:25.679
No, but he warned me back then
not to go running my mouth.

32:25.711 --> 32:28.781
We found the tornado shelter
where he locked kids up.

32:28.814 --> 32:30.601
There are initials carved inside.

32:30.750 --> 32:31.852
And it made us wonder.

32:31.884 --> 32:33.920
Maybe Petey wasn't the
only one who disappeared.

32:33.953 --> 32:35.655
Am I right?

32:35.689 --> 32:37.824
Anybody else go missing?

32:37.858 --> 32:39.293
You need to let this go.

32:39.325 --> 32:40.928
Just tell me! You can trust me.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.630
I mean it!
I don't want to see you get hurt.

32:42.662 --> 32:45.046
Just go home and leave me be.

32:45.129 --> 32:46.132
Amy.

32:46.166 --> 32:48.268
(door squeaks open, closes)

32:48.301 --> 32:50.838
(panting)

33:03.784 --> 33:05.785
(sighs)

33:11.792 --> 33:13.861
(sighs)

33:26.872 --> 33:28.342
(sighs)

33:36.416 --> 33:38.419
(distant chatter)

33:48.228 --> 33:50.230
(indistinct chatter and laughter)

33:52.919 --> 33:54.101
You recognize anybody?

33:54.133 --> 33:56.969
Yeah. A couple of oil men, lobbyists.

33:57.003 --> 33:58.906
That guy with the
glasses is the chairman

33:58.939 --> 34:00.407
of the State Senate Finance Committee.

34:00.439 --> 34:01.775
This is like

34:01.807 --> 34:03.776
a who's who of Texas power players.

34:03.809 --> 34:05.845
Diana: Well, aren't you all gentlemen!

34:05.878 --> 34:08.281
So, what's on the menu tonight, Ray?

34:08.313 --> 34:10.717
Steak or steak?

34:10.751 --> 34:12.119
(laughter)

34:12.150 --> 34:14.152
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

34:14.186 --> 34:15.755
What? You know her?

34:15.789 --> 34:17.791
Yeah, that's Diana Stockman.

34:17.824 --> 34:19.257
Who?

34:19.291 --> 34:22.462
She's a client at our
firm as of this morning.

34:47.996 --> 34:51.123
What happened to you boys?

35:01.133 --> 35:03.297
Hey, Jessie?

35:06.337 --> 35:07.923
Jess?

35:11.811 --> 35:13.539
(phone beeps)

35:13.936 --> 35:16.809
<i>Hi. This is Jessie.</i>
Leave a message and I'll call you back.

35:17.433 --> 35:19.590
Listen, I just want to, um...

35:20.820 --> 35:23.950
say that I'm sorry.

35:24.065 --> 35:25.602
(laughs)

35:25.717 --> 35:30.475
I've been such a...
stubborn jackass lately.

35:30.508 --> 35:31.334
Uh...

35:31.367 --> 35:35.468
I-I know that you were
trying to help me.

35:36.901 --> 35:39.236
But I guess I just...

35:39.351 --> 35:41.648
I didn't think that I could be helped.

35:43.276 --> 35:45.345
I don't know.

35:45.379 --> 35:46.347
(sighs)

35:46.379 --> 35:48.448
Thought I was destined to, um,

35:48.481 --> 35:50.684
go down with this thing.

35:50.783 --> 35:52.487
Destiny's a joke,

35:52.519 --> 35:55.889
and if-if you're still willing to,
uh, to help,

35:55.923 --> 35:59.828
then I-I'd be the stupidest man
alive not to take that deal.

35:59.860 --> 36:02.063
I love you, Jessie.

36:03.466 --> 36:06.867
And I'm gonna be waiting

36:06.900 --> 36:09.069
right here when you come home.

36:09.103 --> 36:10.271
All right.

36:11.858 --> 36:13.307
(sniffs)

36:17.289 --> 36:19.454
(sighs)

36:19.652 --> 36:21.516
- Senator, I'll see you at the game.
- Pleasure.

36:21.548 --> 36:22.516
Drive safe.

36:22.550 --> 36:24.019
Good night now.

36:25.087 --> 36:26.587
Well, after all that,

36:26.621 --> 36:29.423
I think we can call this election,
don't you?

36:29.456 --> 36:31.625
Unfortunately, we got a problem.

36:31.659 --> 36:33.294
Jackson Brooks isn't going away.

36:33.327 --> 36:36.064
If you're referring to
that incident with the DEA,

36:36.097 --> 36:37.398
I thought you handled that.

36:37.430 --> 36:39.759
I did,
but my man on the ground's not happy.

36:39.858 --> 36:41.435
You mean Terry Bausch?

36:41.468 --> 36:42.803
Mm-hmm.

36:42.836 --> 36:45.172
Fact, I got a mad dog on my hands.

36:45.205 --> 36:47.307
Honestly, can you blame him?

36:47.341 --> 36:50.145
We've let this go on far too long.

36:50.178 --> 36:51.546
<i>We</i> haven't done anything.

36:51.579 --> 36:52.852
Things are escalating, Diana.

36:52.902 --> 36:55.283
And I'm telling you to curb your dog.

36:55.316 --> 36:58.188
And you don't need to
worry about Jackson Brooks.

36:59.253 --> 37:01.300
I've had plenty of thorns
in my sides in the past

37:01.383 --> 37:04.406
and I've always found a
way to make them go away.

37:06.093 --> 37:07.562
Jackson: <i>Well, she obviously knows</i>

37:07.595 --> 37:09.430
the warden, but that...

37:09.463 --> 37:10.832
that did not look like a campaign thing.

37:10.931 --> 37:11.906
No, I agree.

37:11.966 --> 37:14.368
I mean, I didn't know who
any of those people were.

37:14.401 --> 37:16.170
Why do you think she
hired your law firm?

37:16.204 --> 37:18.439
I have no idea.

37:18.472 --> 37:20.975
I mean, this whole thing just got...

37:21.008 --> 37:22.877
very weird.

37:22.910 --> 37:25.080
("Undercover Lover" by Majik playing)

37:28.943 --> 37:30.919
We should probably call it a night,
right?

37:30.952 --> 37:33.154
Just check in with Gil
and Shawn in the morning.

37:33.187 --> 37:34.856
Yeah, good idea.

37:36.209 --> 37:37.559
(clears throat)

37:42.900 --> 37:45.066
Can I ask you something?

37:48.903 --> 37:52.207
Why did you leave me that morning?

37:52.240 --> 37:55.209
You never came back.

37:58.423 --> 38:00.421
What if we just kept going?

38:01.048 --> 38:02.550
I mean, forget California;

38:02.582 --> 38:04.952
we could be in Mexico by
lunchtime and we could just,

38:04.986 --> 38:07.254
we could find a little
beach somewhere and...

38:07.287 --> 38:09.858
we could start over and
forget this ever happened.

38:09.890 --> 38:11.973
We can't, Jess.

38:13.278 --> 38:14.396
We have to lay low.

38:14.428 --> 38:16.930
We have to stay away
from each other for now.

38:16.963 --> 38:18.960
It's safer this way.

38:20.501 --> 38:22.826
I don't want to say good-bye like this.

38:24.405 --> 38:26.408
I'm not leaving.

38:29.711 --> 38:32.470
I'll call you, I promise.

38:32.701 --> 38:34.482
Okay.

38:36.534 --> 38:38.887
(sobs quietly)

39:00.177 --> 39:02.243
I was scared.

39:02.276 --> 39:03.729
Of what?

39:05.146 --> 39:06.615
Of hurting you.

39:11.278 --> 39:13.320
Dragging you down to where I was.

39:13.354 --> 39:15.763
I had so much...

39:15.895 --> 39:18.736
so much guilt.

39:18.959 --> 39:20.494
And rage.

39:23.997 --> 39:26.435
You deserved so much better.

39:45.453 --> 39:47.422
(door opens and closes)

39:53.493 --> 39:55.497
(keys rattle, purse thumps)

40:10.310 --> 40:11.312
Hello?

40:41.075 --> 40:42.442
(gasps)

40:42.475 --> 40:44.611
(muffled screaming)

40:44.645 --> 40:46.648
(alarm whooping)

40:50.183 --> 40:52.187
(phone ringing)

40:56.039 --> 40:57.658
I'm sorry.

40:57.692 --> 40:59.838
Damn phone.

41:16.343 --> 41:18.345
(ringing)

41:22.183 --> 41:23.484
Jackson: You gotta be kidding me.

41:23.517 --> 41:25.520
Jessie: Maybe you should get it.

41:27.221 --> 41:28.189
Hello.

41:28.221 --> 41:29.189
Woman: Is this Jackson Brooks?

41:29.223 --> 41:30.391
Yeah. Yeah, who's this?

41:30.424 --> 41:32.527
I'm calling from Vantage
Protective Services.

41:32.560 --> 41:35.096
The panic button in your
house was just activated.

41:35.129 --> 41:36.964
Are you at home right now, sir?

41:36.997 --> 41:38.499
Uh, uh, no. No, I'm not.

41:38.531 --> 41:41.468
Um, my... my fiancée is.

41:41.502 --> 41:43.604
Uh, send someone now. Send someone <i>now.</i>

41:43.636 --> 41:45.439
What is it? What's wrong?

41:45.473 --> 41:47.208
Uh...

41:47.241 --> 41:48.815
I gotta go.

41:49.278 --> 41:51.541
I think something's happened to Marina.
