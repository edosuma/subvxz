right around $10.5 million.

when people were not

04:17.758 --> 04:19.059

So how did you do that?

04:20.560 --> 04:24.598
So we shut our dining down
like everybody else.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.533
Did only takeout.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.268
And delivery.

Herjavec: Dok,
what's your background?

Hey, we love Korean!"

So I'm Korean, and just
fell in love with the product.

04:54.194 --> 04:55.862
I went,
moved to New York,

04:55.862 --> 04:58.799
did my kind of seven,
eight years there,

04:58.799 --> 05:01.268
and I just wanted
something different.

05:01.268 --> 05:04.037
Did you go and pitch him
on being his partner?

05:04.037 --> 05:05.071
He called me.
That's right.

05:05.071 --> 05:06.239
I called him up.

05:06.239 --> 05:08.809
But he said, "If you not
hire me right now,

you're gonna regret it
for the future."

05:10.911 --> 05:12.879
Who owns the business,
and what percentage?

05:12.879 --> 05:16.082
So we own half
of the business.

05:16.082 --> 05:18.318
Oh, so you've raised
a lot of money then?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.554
No, we've actually

05:20.554 --> 05:22.122
never raised money.
With all that growth?

05:22.122 --> 05:23.590
Who owns the other half?
Who owns the other half?

05:23.590 --> 05:26.293
The other half,
his co-founders.

05:26.293 --> 05:28.461
Oh, okay.
And a group came in

05:28.461 --> 05:31.698
and just bought equity
off of the other three partners.

05:31.698 --> 05:33.099
What did they pay
for that equity?

05:33.099 --> 05:34.201
What valuation?

05:34.201 --> 05:35.902

are just gone basically.

05:46.713 --> 05:47.914
you pivoted, right?
Yeah.

05:47.914 --> 05:50.417

go to the stores,

05:50.417 --> 05:52.752
you said you were doing

Mm-hmm.

I was born in Korea.

07:09.462 --> 07:14.834
And when I was 11, my family
came on a summer vacation

07:14.834 --> 07:18.738
in the U. S., and the day before
we were supposed to fly back,

07:18.738 --> 07:22.642
my mom and dad sat me down
and my older brother and said,

07:22.642 --> 07:25.011
"Oh, by the way,
we didn't tell you,

07:25.011 --> 07:26.913
but you guys are not
coming back with us."

So they had planned
this all along.

07:31.017 --> 07:34.421
So they found a family,
a school,

07:34.421 --> 07:37.023
and they thought
that if they told us,

07:37.023 --> 07:38.925
we wouldn't want to come,

07:38.925 --> 07:40.627
and so they
did it the hard way.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.495
The next day, bam.

07:42.495 --> 07:43.863
My God.
Wow.

07:43.863 --> 07:48.201
And they chose Utah
because they just heard

that Utah was
a religious state,

07:50.203 --> 07:52.305
that a lot of people
don't smoke and drink.

got to be safe."

07:56.309 --> 08:00.146

that story is incredible.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.515
Why do you think
your parents did that?

08:02.515 --> 08:05.552
Why did they drop you off
in America?

08:05.552 --> 08:08.188
It was really
for the opportunity.

08:08.188 --> 08:11.825
Absolute best decision
that they've ever made for us.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.694
And I am just
forever grateful

08:14.694 --> 08:16.062
for what they've
been, you know --

08:16.062 --> 08:17.530
It's amazing how
the people who grew up here

08:17.530 --> 08:19.165
don't feel the same way.

08:19.165 --> 08:22.235

your parents sacrificed

is $4,800,

20:52.051 --> 20:53.486
so it's very affordable.
Wow.

wherever you want it.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.696
From there, you have about
15 minutes of setup.

21:03.696 --> 21:06.398
And that 15 minutes is mostly
filling it up with a hose.

21:06.398 --> 21:08.501
The question is how big
is your market, right?

21:08.501 --> 21:10.469
Totally.
Because what happens
when somebody comes up

21:10.469 --> 21:13.239
with a good product,
you get all the pent-up demand

21:13.239 --> 21:15.775
as people hear about it
and they dive in, right?
100%.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.810
So you get
this initial surge.

21:17.810 --> 21:22.214
But at a $24.5 million valuation
and only having 5%,

21:22.214 --> 21:26.519
you have to make $24 million
in distributable cash profits

21:26.519 --> 21:29.054
in order for us
to get our money back, right?

21:29.054 --> 21:31.957
I have to think in terms of not
only can I get my money back,

21:31.957 --> 21:33.926
but how much more money
can I make on it?

21:33.926 --> 21:35.694
And for you to come on here
with that valuation,

21:35.694 --> 21:36.829
I can't blame you.

21:36.829 --> 21:39.532
I can.
I'll do the blaming.

21:39.532 --> 21:42.535
Okay, so I like the deal
because of the revenue,

21:42.535 --> 21:44.436
but I also see lots
of competitors

21:44.436 --> 21:46.205
that could knock you off.

21:46.205 --> 21:47.640
I'll make you an offer.

I'll give you the $1.2 million
for 18% equity,

21:51.844 --> 21:53.879
but I have to get
my money back somehow,

21:53.879 --> 21:57.516
so I get 18% of the
distributions, you get the rest.

21:57.516 --> 22:00.386
Every time you take
out a dollar, I get 18 cents.

22:01.253 --> 22:04.223

I think. I agree with Mark.

22:04.223 --> 22:05.825

how many years

22:05.825 --> 22:08.761
is it gonna take me
to get my money back?

22:08.761 --> 22:11.297
I wish you the best of luck,
but I'm out.

22:12.598 --> 22:15.201
So, guys,
is more money better?

22:15.201 --> 22:18.070
Like, is the $1.2 million,
when you've calculated,

22:18.070 --> 22:21.540
what you really need, or is it
like if you got more money,

22:21.540 --> 22:23.976
would it make life better,
would make things go faster?

22:23.976 --> 22:25.678
So $1.2 million
gets us --

22:25.678 --> 22:28.247
it's enough for 400 units
that we can build.

for 20%.

the form of half a loan

22:38.090 --> 22:40.192

whatever you prefer,

22:40.192 --> 22:41.660
because I think
that you really need.

22:41.660 --> 22:44.163

cash-flow problems.

22:44.163 --> 22:46.198

22:46.198 --> 22:48.334

22:48.334 --> 22:50.336

do things go faster?

22:53.873 --> 22:57.009

23:00.079 --> 23:03.015
$1.2 million
for straight equity.

23:03.015 --> 23:05.117
I want 15% for that.

23:05.117 --> 23:07.186

the other $1.2 million

23:07.186 --> 23:08.787

23:08.787 --> 23:10.689

from the bank.

will make things go faster.

It took three years of effort
to get on this show.

Basically, the valuation is that
we wanted to come in here

exclusively online.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.561

this is a product
that's ripe for retail.

27:11.530 --> 27:12.965
How much does it cost?

$29.99,

we were at $11.43,

Why do you think
your sales are so low?

27:28.447 --> 27:31.183
Personally, I think
that people like this,

27:31.183 --> 27:33.752
but it doesn't move the needle
enough in that mainstream market

27:33.752 --> 27:35.687

You know,
I think in hindsight,

promoted it better

That's not an arena that

28:45.824 --> 28:47.960

the right question then, right?

28:47.960 --> 28:49.962
How much money
have you spent on advertising?

28:51.029 --> 28:53.899
For that amount of sales,
we spent $553 on Facebook ads.

28:53.899 --> 28:56.268
There you go. Right?
It's a very, very hard

28:56.268 --> 28:59.705
to sell direct to consumer
online from your own website.

28:59.705 --> 29:01.240
So the next question becomes,

29:01.240 --> 29:03.075
did you try to sell these
on Amazon?

29:03.075 --> 29:04.810
We did not.

34:05.677 --> 34:08.113
Ah! So therein
lies the rub, right?
Greiner: Yeah.

34:08.113 --> 34:10.282
Because these should have
a lot of margin.

34:10.282 --> 34:13.318
So ad spend, right?
That's there.

34:13.318 --> 34:16.721
About 20% of our margin
is in ads.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.623
So you said you're gonna do
$6 million to $7 million.

34:18.623 --> 34:21.760
So when you say 20%, is that
your pretax net earnings?

34:21.760 --> 34:24.229
-Yeah. So that's EBITDA.
-Okay.

34:24.229 --> 34:27.232
All of that goes
right back into inventory.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.067
And so therein lies
the problem, right?

34:29.067 --> 34:31.202
Right.
It's a beast that
you're constantly feeding.

34:31.202 --> 34:33.104
But, Seneca, the big-tape people
can do the same thing.

34:33.104 --> 34:34.673
Like, what's making yours
stand out?

34:34.673 --> 34:37.876
Some of this tape that you use,
right, people are allergic.

34:37.876 --> 34:40.111
And they'll have rashes
or pull their hair out.
Greiner: Right.

34:40.111 --> 34:42.347
So there's a different adhesive
that we actually have

34:42.347 --> 34:43.448
in our tape.

34:43.448 --> 34:44.849
It's not proprietary,

34:44.849 --> 34:46.751
but no one's used it
in the way that we're using it.

34:46.751 --> 34:48.787
So that's
the secret sauce?
That's it. Yeah.

34:48.787 --> 34:50.322
So there's no patent
on your product at all?

34:50.322 --> 34:51.523
No, there's no patent.

34:51.523 --> 34:53.058
Cuban:
It takes a lot of learning

34:53.058 --> 34:55.393
in the advertising
and SEO space.

34:55.393 --> 34:57.696
Yeah.
So what was the process
you went through there

34:57.696 --> 34:58.897
to get to the top?
Let me answer that.

34:58.897 --> 35:01.132
About seven years ago,

35:01.132 --> 35:04.069
I started at a company
as a customer-service rep,

35:04.069 --> 35:06.004
and they were selling
light bulbs,

35:06.004 --> 35:07.772
and it was a similar model.

35:07.772 --> 35:11.676
And I just dedicated myself
and I spent 80 hours a week

35:11.676 --> 35:14.279
just working
and getting paid to learn,

35:14.279 --> 35:16.881
and I grinded it out
for three years.

35:16.881 --> 35:18.283
I said, "I think
I figured this out.

35:18.283 --> 35:19.651
I think
I know how to do it."

35:19.651 --> 35:22.253
And so I went to look
for a product for myself,

35:22.253 --> 35:23.588
and I grew up
playing football.

35:23.588 --> 35:25.590
And so I've used
a lot of athletic tape.

35:25.590 --> 35:27.459
I wanted to learn
how to become wealthy.

35:27.459 --> 35:28.727
How do I build wealth?

35:28.727 --> 35:30.261
If you knew where I came from,
you'd be like,

35:30.261 --> 35:32.130
"There's no reason you should be
standing here right now."

35:32.130 --> 35:33.598
Where did you come from?

35:33.598 --> 35:36.534
So I'm from L. A. originally,

35:36.534 --> 35:39.404
and I have four brothers,
four sisters,

35:39.404 --> 35:42.474
and there were days
where we'd go to Burger King,

35:42.474 --> 35:44.843
grab a $1 burger,
slice it in four,

35:44.843 --> 35:46.344
and that was dinner.

35:46.344 --> 35:49.180
We grew up like that --
motels, sleeping out of cars,

35:49.180 --> 35:51.883
and I was just like,
"This ain't it."

35:51.883 --> 35:53.852
And as I got older, I was like,
"You know what?

35:53.852 --> 35:55.954
I'm gonna dedicate myself
to figuring this out."

35:55.954 --> 35:58.423
And so I learned --
you build wealth,

35:58.423 --> 35:59.758
start a business.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.793
To start a business,
you need to sell your product.

36:01.793 --> 36:02.994
And so I learned sales.

36:02.994 --> 36:05.196
So what do you need
the $500,000 for?

36:05.196 --> 36:07.399
It's a cash-flow business,
and so my orders --

36:07.399 --> 36:10.035
I don't order one time
at the beginning of the year.

36:10.035 --> 36:12.737
I'm ordering every month and
getting shipments every month

36:12.737 --> 36:14.673
to be able to take the cash
they're giving

36:14.673 --> 36:15.807
into the next order
and the next order.

36:15.807 --> 36:17.308
You're basically
breaking even.

36:17.308 --> 36:19.577
Basically, to scale it
and grow it.
On a cash basis.

36:19.577 --> 36:21.379
Yeah.
But as long as
your sales are growing,

36:21.379 --> 36:24.115
it's like you're feeding
the dragon.
Exactly.

36:24.115 --> 36:26.284
Like, it keeps growing.
You got to keep feeding it.

36:26.284 --> 36:29.220
And so I never get out
of the spot where it's like,

36:29.220 --> 36:31.790
if something goes wrong,
this will all come tumbling.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.658
Cuban: Seneca, you know,
there's a bunch of companies

36:33.658 --> 36:35.727

to acquire you?

those e-mails from those people.

36:41.766 --> 36:43.835
And why haven't you
pursued any of that?

36:43.835 --> 36:46.337
Because I'm on the fence of,
should I sell it

36:46.337 --> 36:48.239
or should I keep it going?
Herjavec: Yes.

36:48.239 --> 36:49.574
If I keep it going,
then --

36:49.574 --> 36:50.742
You should sell it.

36:50.742 --> 36:51.910

and I love every business
I started.

36:56.781 --> 37:00.051

the best time to sell

you need to sell

42:10.595 --> 42:12.330
I'm gonna sell the company.

42:12.330 --> 42:15.566
I didn't get a deal, but I got
something much more valuable.

42:15.566 --> 42:17.635
I got knowledge
from millionaire--

42:17.635 --> 42:19.003
multimillionaires
and billionaires,

42:19.003 --> 42:21.139
which you can't put
a price tag on.

42:21.139 --> 42:23.007
They've been through it
before you.

42:23.007 --> 42:25.410
So, to me, that's like gold.
