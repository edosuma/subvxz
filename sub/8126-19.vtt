¶ Boy, the way
Glenn Miller played ¶

00:05.404 --> 00:09.040
¶ songs that made
the hit parade ¶

00:09.108 --> 00:12.711
¶ guys like us
we had it made ¶

00:12.778 --> 00:16.014
[ together ]
¶ those were the days ¶

00:16.082 --> 00:19.217
<i>¶ and you knew</i>

00:19.284 --> 00:23.254
[ Archie ]
¶ girls were girls
and men were men ¶

00:23.322 --> 00:25.757
[ Archie, Edith ]
¶ mister, we could use a man ¶

00:25.825 --> 00:29.560
¶ like Herbert hoover again ¶

00:29.629 --> 00:32.964
[ Archie ]
¶ didn't need no welfare state ¶

00:33.032 --> 00:36.267
[ Edith ]
¶ everybody pulled his weight ¶

00:36.335 --> 00:40.171
[ Archie, Edith ]
¶ gee, our old lasalle
ran great ¶

00:40.239 --> 00:44.676
¶ those were the days ¶

00:52.251 --> 00:55.720
Gloria, will you hurry it up?
Your father's got me in another
one of his stupid arguments.

00:55.788 --> 00:58.422
That's 'cause when
you're arguing
about something stupid...

00:58.490 --> 01:02.593
With somebody who's also stupid,
the argument is
bound to be stupid.

01:02.662 --> 01:05.530
Right, stupid?

01:05.597 --> 01:07.532
Come on, Gloria!
We're gonna miss the bus!

01:07.599 --> 01:12.470
Oh, she missed the bus
the day she said
"I do" to you.

01:12.538 --> 01:14.472
Will you lay off, arch?

01:14.540 --> 01:18.710
Here, Mike. I made you
something to eat in case
you get hungry on the trip.

01:18.778 --> 01:23.214
On the trip?
He's gonna woof that down
walking to the subway.

01:23.282 --> 01:26.551
Daddy, will you lay off Michael?
We're gonna be gone
for eight days.

01:26.618 --> 01:28.553
Do we have to leave
on an angry note?

01:28.620 --> 01:31.622
With him, is there
any other way? Come on.
Let me help you with your pack.

01:31.691 --> 01:34.092
Oh, help her with her pack.
Look at this here.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.594
He's loading her up
like she's a mule.

01:36.662 --> 01:40.031
All so they can go away
and live with a bunch
of commie slobs.

01:41.433 --> 01:43.568
Daddy, they're not communists,
and you know it.

01:43.635 --> 01:45.670
They're members
of a farming commune.

01:45.738 --> 01:49.273
People who live in communes
are comm-u-nists.

01:52.178 --> 01:55.580
You're wrong, daddy.
Why are you putting down
a group of kids...

01:55.647 --> 01:58.917
Who are trying to build a life
based on love and sharing?

01:58.984 --> 02:01.052
I know all about
that kind of sharing.

02:01.120 --> 02:03.121
First, it's "pass the bread."

02:03.189 --> 02:06.024
Next, it's "kindly
pass your wife."

02:06.092 --> 02:08.026
Come on, Michael.
We're gonna be late.

02:08.094 --> 02:11.362
No, wait a second.
All week you've been treating
us like criminals...

02:11.430 --> 02:13.397
Just because we're gonna
spend a few days
with some people...

02:13.465 --> 02:16.101
Who are sick and tired
of your dog-eat-dog world.

02:16.168 --> 02:21.106
If everybody run off and lived
in them communes, what do you
think are gonna happen, huh?

02:21.173 --> 02:24.876
Who'd run the machinery of this
world? Who'd drive the subways?
How would I get to work?

02:24.944 --> 02:28.113
But, arch, not everyone
is gonna run off to a commune.

02:28.180 --> 02:31.082
Don't you see?
It's a question of each man
doing his own thing.

02:31.150 --> 02:34.886
Your thing just happens to be
grubbing for a living in this
polluted, grime-ridden city.

02:34.954 --> 02:38.189
And your thing
is spongin' off of my thing.

02:38.257 --> 02:41.359
- Good-bye.
- And good "ribbance."

02:41.426 --> 02:44.129
You can stay in that commune
for life for all I care.

02:44.196 --> 02:48.767
I just might stay, arch. And if
I do, that means your daughter's
staying with me. Come on.

02:48.834 --> 02:52.536
Don't be too sure there!
Blood is thicker than water!
Don't you never forget that!

02:52.604 --> 02:55.706
Gloria, Mike, you will
come back, won't you?

02:55.775 --> 02:58.743
Gloria?

02:58.811 --> 03:01.012
Well, have a good time.

03:03.816 --> 03:07.485
Did you hear that?
He said he might
never come back.

03:07.552 --> 03:12.323
Aw, baloney.
We ain't gonna lose him
till we sell the refrigerator.

03:17.562 --> 03:22.600
Archie, do you realize
this is the first time...

03:22.668 --> 03:26.504
We've been alone for years?
[ Grunts in affirmation ]

03:28.174 --> 03:30.842
We got eight whole days
ahead of us.

03:30.910 --> 03:33.812
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, my.

03:33.879 --> 03:38.850
I feel like I did
on our honeymoon--
all goose pimply.

03:38.918 --> 03:41.485
I remember.

03:41.553 --> 03:44.655
Could hardly find you
behind all them bumps.

03:48.527 --> 03:51.196
Archie,

03:51.263 --> 03:54.098
do you like
being alone with me?

03:54.166 --> 03:57.601
Certainly I like being
alone with you, Edith.

03:57.669 --> 04:00.104
Turn on the tv.

04:00.172 --> 04:03.842
Oh, let's not watch tv.

04:03.909 --> 04:06.344
We don't talk enough.

04:06.411 --> 04:08.612
You talk enough, Edith.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.451
Archie?
Yeah?

04:14.820 --> 04:16.754
I miss the kids.

04:17.890 --> 04:21.659
They just left, Edith.
I don't miss them.

04:21.726 --> 04:24.562
We're gonna have a beautiful,
peaceful week here without them.

04:24.629 --> 04:27.265
They're doin'
what they wanna do.
We can do what we wanna do.

04:27.333 --> 04:31.736
Got a lot of privacy now. We can
do a lot of things we couldn't
do with the kids hangin' around.

04:31.803 --> 04:34.239
Yeah.

04:34.306 --> 04:36.875
Like what?

04:36.942 --> 04:42.046
Edith, like, uh--
like anything you wanna name.

04:42.114 --> 04:46.717
Like, for instance,
we can get into the "toirlet"
whenever we want.

04:48.087 --> 04:51.256
Oh, Archie.

04:51.323 --> 04:53.358
I know.

04:53.425 --> 04:56.527
Let's put on a record
and dance.

04:56.595 --> 04:58.596
What?
Yeah.

04:58.663 --> 05:04.502
The other day I found
our old copy of Glenn Miller's
"moonlight serenade."

05:04.569 --> 05:08.806
Aw, geez.
Remember how we
used to dance to that?

05:08.874 --> 05:11.709
Oh, Edith, come on, huh?

05:11.777 --> 05:16.247
Remember how you used to
hold me in your arms,
[ Groans ]

05:16.315 --> 05:19.250
And I used to snuggle up
against your cheek?

05:19.318 --> 05:21.485
¶
oh, come on.

05:21.553 --> 05:24.355
Look out, Edith.
You're tearing the paper here.
Come on.

05:24.423 --> 05:28.659
Come on, will ya?
Act your age.

05:28.727 --> 05:33.164
Even Fred Astaire
and ginger Rogers
don't dance together no more.

05:34.233 --> 05:36.634
And turn that thing off.

05:36.701 --> 05:39.237
Turn it off, Edith.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.880
Come on. Sit down over here
and be nice and quiet.

05:49.949 --> 05:52.050
You want part of the paper?

05:52.117 --> 05:54.452
Archie, I'm scared.

05:54.519 --> 05:56.454
You're scared of what?

05:56.521 --> 05:59.590
Of what if the kids
do leave permanent?

05:59.658 --> 06:03.661
Because that's when
marriages fall apart.

06:03.728 --> 06:07.231
The husband and wife
are left alone,

06:07.299 --> 06:11.202
and all of a sudden,
they don't know
each other no more.

06:11.270 --> 06:13.204
They kind of drifted apart.

06:13.272 --> 06:15.373
They got nothin' in common.

06:15.441 --> 06:20.811
Edith, where do you get
all this crapola?

06:22.848 --> 06:26.484
Well, I heard it on television
from Dr. Joyce brothers.

06:26.551 --> 06:29.420
Aw, geez!

06:29.488 --> 06:32.756
She calls it
the "marriage vacuum."
[ Groans ]

06:32.824 --> 06:37.095
When a husband and wife
don't do nothin' together
no more.

06:37.162 --> 06:39.697
All right, Edith.
You wanna do
somethin' together?

06:39.764 --> 06:41.866
I'll tell ya
what we'll do.

06:41.933 --> 06:44.002
First, you go out
in the kitchen
and get me some beer.

06:44.069 --> 06:46.737
Yeah?
And then I'll drink it.

06:52.277 --> 06:54.845
Come on, Edith.
Don't fall apart.

06:54.913 --> 06:59.150
I was only kiddin' ya.
Hey, you wanna play some cards?
Yeah.

06:59.218 --> 07:01.285
You go out in the kitchen,
you get the beer.

07:01.353 --> 07:03.354
I'll get the cards.
We'll play a couple of hands.

07:03.422 --> 07:05.723
Good. That'll be fun.

07:05.790 --> 07:07.591
[ Chuckling ]

07:07.659 --> 07:09.593
Geez.

07:13.265 --> 07:15.166
There's one thing true
about marriage.

07:15.234 --> 07:17.935
It keeps you
from readin' the paper.

07:18.003 --> 07:20.471
What kind of cards
you wanna play there, Edith?

07:20.539 --> 07:23.908
Gin rummy, Archie dear.
Okay.

07:23.975 --> 07:25.910
Anything you want.

07:25.977 --> 07:28.646
Don't make no difference
to me what game I beat ya at.

07:28.713 --> 07:30.648
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah.

07:30.715 --> 07:33.617
I guess we're out of beer.
Huh?

07:33.685 --> 07:36.687
I'm sorry. I guess
I forgot to buy it.

07:36.755 --> 07:39.590
Aw, geez, Edith.
I don't ask for much
around here.

07:39.658 --> 07:42.527
Is it too much to ask you
to keep some beer in the house?

07:42.594 --> 07:45.029
I said I was sorry.

07:45.097 --> 07:49.300
Aw, geez.
How you gonna play a game
of rummy without no beer?

07:49.368 --> 07:51.302
[ Sighs ]

07:51.370 --> 07:54.172
A man's got a right to expect
a few little things
from his wife.

07:54.239 --> 07:59.043
Well, a wife's got a right
to expect a few little things
from her husband.

07:59.111 --> 08:01.312
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

08:03.482 --> 08:05.516
And what few little things
do you expect?

08:06.685 --> 08:10.354
I expect you to say
you're sorry sometimes.

08:10.422 --> 08:13.157
Why should I say I'm sorry?
I didn't forget the beer.

08:13.225 --> 08:15.293
You done that.
You say you're sorry.

08:18.029 --> 08:21.532
Aw, geez.
Here we go again.

08:21.600 --> 08:25.369
I know that look.
That's your family's trademark.

08:25.437 --> 08:27.972
Whenever they got somethin'
festering up inside 'em,

08:28.039 --> 08:31.909
<i>they always go skinny</i>
<i>in the nose.</i>

08:31.977 --> 08:35.580
<i>And they get that</i>
<i>little frozen look</i>
<i>around the mouth there.</i>

08:35.647 --> 08:37.414
Yeah, that's it.

08:37.482 --> 08:41.818
That's just the way
your relatives was looking
at me the day you married me.

08:41.885 --> 08:44.222
Well, come on.
Get it over with. What is it?

08:45.290 --> 08:47.558
Well, I've been thinkin'.

08:47.626 --> 08:49.560
In all the years
we been married,

08:49.628 --> 08:52.130
you never once said
you was sorry.

08:52.197 --> 08:57.101
Edith, I'll gladly say I'm sorry
if I am ever wrong.

09:01.306 --> 09:03.207
Come on. We're out here
to have a little fun.

09:03.275 --> 09:05.309
Here, pick up your cards,
get them together.

09:05.377 --> 09:08.179
Let's play
a little cards, huh?
All right, Archie.

09:08.247 --> 09:11.616
[ Sighs ]
Let's see what I got
myself here. Hey. Ooh.

09:11.683 --> 09:13.618
Hey. Ooh, ooh. Ooh!

09:13.685 --> 09:17.321
It's not so bad at all.
All right. Let's go.
Play the game.

09:17.389 --> 09:19.957
You don't want the four
of diamonds.
Pick from the deck.

09:20.025 --> 09:23.194
Let's go. That's the way.
This card, now. Come on.
Hey! Hey!

09:23.262 --> 09:25.196
Look at that.
Ten of hearts.

09:25.264 --> 09:28.266
It goes right in there
like it had a pair of eyes.

09:28.333 --> 09:32.770
I give you a little deuce there,
but this card goes.

09:32.837 --> 09:34.772
There we are.

09:34.839 --> 09:38.442
Ten of spades! Look at that!
Edith, what are you doing here?

09:38.510 --> 09:41.779
What's the name of this game?
Gin rummy.

09:41.846 --> 09:44.915
[ Chuckling ]
You gave it to me on
a silver platter there, Edith.

09:44.983 --> 09:46.917
How many points you got?

09:46.985 --> 09:49.620
Oh, look at this.
You're loaded there.
You got--

09:49.688 --> 09:52.056
wait a minute.
What are you doing?
Don't you see?

09:52.123 --> 09:54.692
You broke up
your own run here, Edith.

09:54.759 --> 09:58.162
You got the nine Jack,
the queen of spades.
You gave me the ten of spades.

09:58.230 --> 10:02.300
- Is it my deal?
- No, wait a minute.
Forget the deal.

10:03.569 --> 10:05.536
You don't play that bad.

10:05.604 --> 10:07.538
You gave me this ten of spades
on purpose.

10:07.606 --> 10:10.474
- I did?
- Yeah, you did.
Why'd you do that?

10:12.544 --> 10:14.612
Well, Archie,

10:14.680 --> 10:18.482
I thought it would
make you feel better
if I let you win.

10:18.550 --> 10:20.484
What?

10:23.955 --> 10:27.391
That will be the day--
when I gotta win
by you letting me win.

10:27.459 --> 10:29.727
I was winning here before you
let me win.

10:29.794 --> 10:33.097
You know what you done now?
You spoiled the game.
I don't wanna play no more.

10:33.164 --> 10:36.033
You wanna do something together,
do something together
by yourself.

10:37.236 --> 10:39.403
Archie, I'm sorry.

10:39.471 --> 10:41.472
I thought I was doing
a good thing.

10:41.540 --> 10:44.609
Oh, sure. A good thing.
That's you all over.

10:44.676 --> 10:46.844
You're always doing good.
Edith the good.

10:46.911 --> 10:49.447
You never get mad at nobody.
You never holler at nobody.

10:49.514 --> 10:51.449
You never swear.
No nothing.

10:51.516 --> 10:54.619
You're like a Saint.
You think it's fun
living with a Saint?

10:54.686 --> 10:57.087
It ain't.
It ain't at all.

10:57.155 --> 10:59.590
Look at this--
you don't even cheat to win.

10:59.658 --> 11:01.592
You cheat to lose!

11:03.495 --> 11:05.529
I mean, Edith,
you ain't human!

11:06.598 --> 11:09.032
That's a terrible thing
to say.

11:09.100 --> 11:11.235
I'm just as human as you are.

11:11.303 --> 11:14.705
Prove you're
just as human as me.
Do something rotten.

11:18.443 --> 11:20.645
All right. I will.

11:20.712 --> 11:25.015
You're a-- you're--
you're a-- oh!

11:32.457 --> 11:34.792
I can't.
I know you can't.

11:34.859 --> 11:38.496
You can't do nothing
that ain't good.
You ain't human.

11:38.563 --> 11:40.564
I am so human!

11:40.632 --> 11:44.935
How can you say that I'm not
after 23 years of marriage?

11:45.003 --> 11:47.805
How can you stand there
and say I'm not hu--
[ Sobbing ]

11:47.872 --> 11:51.108
Aw, geez,
now you're gonna cry on me.
I can't help it.

11:51.176 --> 11:53.644
That was a terrible thing
to say.

11:53.712 --> 11:56.146
I can't stand here
and fight with you
if you're gonna cry.

11:56.214 --> 11:58.549
I can't help it.
I'm sorry.

11:58.617 --> 12:02.320
You say you're sorry,

12:02.387 --> 12:05.456
Stop that! Stop that!

12:05.524 --> 12:09.427
Archie, things will
never be the same between us...

12:09.494 --> 12:11.429
If you don't
say you're sorry!

12:11.496 --> 12:14.131
Are you gonna stop crying?
I can't!

12:14.199 --> 12:16.867
Then that's it!
Archie,
where are you going?

12:16.935 --> 12:20.504
I'm gonna go out!
Please say you're sorry!

12:20.572 --> 12:22.673
I'll give you one more chance
to stop crying!

12:22.741 --> 12:24.675
You gonna stop?
I can't!

12:24.743 --> 12:27.978

You pushed me too far, Edith!

12:28.046 --> 12:31.215

No, maude.
It's been a whole week now,

12:43.228 --> 12:46.364
and Archie
ain't said he's sorry.

12:46.431 --> 12:50.701
Sure, we talk.
Every night he says to me,
"I'll see you later.

12:50.769 --> 12:53.371
I'm going down to kelcy's bar."

12:53.438 --> 12:56.240
No, I ain't forgiving him
until he says--

<i>[ Archie ] Jimmy,</i>
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>
<i>There's Archie.</i>

good evening, Archie.

13:39.951 --> 13:42.319
Hey, Edith. Hey, Edith.
Look at me. Look at me.

13:42.387 --> 13:44.789
You know what I am?
You know what
you're looking at here?

13:44.856 --> 13:47.691
The electric
shuffleboard champion
of kelcy's bar and grill.

13:47.759 --> 13:49.727
Oh, Edith, you should've
been down there.

13:49.795 --> 13:52.195
Nobody could stop me.
I was beating them all.

13:52.263 --> 13:54.799
Zip, bam. Zip, bam.
Zip, bam, bam, bam! Bam!

13:54.866 --> 13:57.535
Crowd gathering all around me.
You know what they
was calling themselves?

13:57.602 --> 14:00.337
"Archie's army."

14:00.405 --> 14:03.707
I didn't disappoint nobody.
I retired undefeated.

14:04.776 --> 14:06.710
I'll get you some coffee.

14:06.778 --> 14:08.913
Don't you put yourself
to no trouble there, Edith.

14:08.980 --> 14:11.715
It's no trouble.
It's my job.

14:14.085 --> 14:16.219
Thank you.
Thank you, Edith.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.895
Hey, uh--
hey, Edith dear,

14:24.963 --> 14:28.165
did you enjoy yourself
around here this evening?

14:28.232 --> 14:31.469
I mean, did anything
nice happen, or-- huh?

14:31.536 --> 14:33.838
Well, we got a telegram
from the kids.

14:33.905 --> 14:35.840
They're fine.
They're coming home tonight.

14:35.907 --> 14:38.275
Oh, hey,
that's swell, Edith.

14:38.343 --> 14:40.410
Maybe we'll get back to normal
around here, huh?

14:40.479 --> 14:42.513
Not exactly, Archie.

14:42.581 --> 14:44.882
Here's your coffee.
I'm going to bed. Good night.

14:44.950 --> 14:47.685
Wait a minute. Wait.

14:47.752 --> 14:50.821
Wait a minute there, Edith.
Come on, will you?

14:50.889 --> 14:54.424
It's the shank of the evening.
You don't have to
go up there now.

14:54.493 --> 14:56.861
Just let me finish my coffee,
and I'll go with you.

14:56.928 --> 15:00.831
Just sit down here, huh?
Just for a minute or two.

15:00.899 --> 15:03.767
There. Ain't that nice?

15:03.835 --> 15:06.904
Just the way you want it now--
the two of us together.

15:14.012 --> 15:17.414
Oh, boy,
that's great coffee, Edith.
I'll say one thing for you.

15:17.482 --> 15:20.651
- You always made great coffee.
- Thank you.

15:22.487 --> 15:24.922
Oh, yeah, I know
what I want to tell you.

15:24.990 --> 15:27.290
- You remember cliff hogan?
- No.

15:28.359 --> 15:31.294
Oh, well,
it's just as well anyhow.

15:31.362 --> 15:34.197
He was arrested tonight
in kelcy's bar. No kidding.

15:34.265 --> 15:37.200
The cops come in there,
they dragged him out
from under his beer.

15:39.704 --> 15:41.705
You know why?
He was beating his wife.

15:42.774 --> 15:44.909
I think a lot of guys
do that, Edith.

15:48.079 --> 15:52.082
That's why so many dames
shoot their husbands.

15:54.553 --> 15:57.922
- Did you ever think about
taking a shot at me?
- No.

15:58.990 --> 16:00.925
That's good.

16:02.627 --> 16:04.595
I never thought about
shooting you neither.

16:07.498 --> 16:10.100
It's nice when two people
get along together, huh?

16:12.203 --> 16:15.039
- Right, Edith?
- Have you finished your coffee?

16:15.106 --> 16:17.374
Wait a minute.
Where are you running away to?

16:17.442 --> 16:21.178
Can't you just sit down here
for a little while? Huh?

16:21.245 --> 16:24.481
I mean, don't you see
what I'm trying to do?
I'm trying to be nice.

16:24.549 --> 16:27.484
I'm trying to make you happy.
Now, be happy! Will you?

16:30.421 --> 16:32.957
You know what
would make me happy.

16:33.024 --> 16:35.626
I'm waiting to hear you say
your sorry.

16:35.694 --> 16:38.996
And nothing
will be right between us
until I hear you say it.

16:39.064 --> 16:42.032
You are selfish, Edith!
That's what you are-- selfish!

16:42.100 --> 16:44.034
You're always
thinking about yourself.

16:44.102 --> 16:47.270
What would happen
to this little family here
if I'd done that, huh?

16:47.338 --> 16:50.507
I've got a lot of things
on my mind too, you know.

16:50.575 --> 16:54.377
What things?
Oh, listen,
plenty of things.

16:54.445 --> 16:56.546
Some of them
are important.

17:00.284 --> 17:02.987
Well, tell me.
What are they?

17:03.054 --> 17:06.189
Well, I mean--
like for instance--

17:06.257 --> 17:09.760
all right. Remember that time
three years ago, down at work?

17:09.828 --> 17:13.195
I was supposed to move upstairs
to the office there.

17:14.265 --> 17:17.701
- You know why I never did?
- No. Why?

17:17.769 --> 17:19.703
Well, because--

17:19.771 --> 17:22.138
if I tell you this,
you gotta promise
you'll never tell a soul,

17:22.205 --> 17:24.608
living or dead.

17:25.810 --> 17:29.312
- I promise.
- All right.

17:29.380 --> 17:32.149
I didn't get that promotion...

17:32.216 --> 17:34.484
Because I didn't
finish high school.

17:35.553 --> 17:39.456
Oh, Archie,
I never knew that.

17:39.524 --> 17:43.393
Well, I didn't want you to be
ashamed of me-- you and Gloria.

17:43.461 --> 17:46.163
And I didn't think
that the meathead knew--

17:46.230 --> 17:48.365
don't you ever
blab this to the meathead.

17:51.369 --> 17:55.338
If he finds out about this,
he'll go around thinking
he's smarter than me.

17:55.406 --> 17:59.943
- I won't tell.
- Anyway, I nearly finished.

18:00.011 --> 18:04.114
I had to quit my last term,
get a job. You know,
help out at home.

18:04.182 --> 18:06.216
Oh, Archie.

18:06.284 --> 18:09.519
Oh, Edith, things were tough
around them times, I tell you.

18:09.587 --> 18:11.689
Boy, I was lucky
to get the job--

18:11.756 --> 18:15.425
pushing a hand truck
full of ladies' ready-to-wear
up and down 7th Avenue.

18:16.828 --> 18:19.462
Yeah. They used to call me
the <i>"goisha"</i> kid.

18:21.265 --> 18:24.668
That's 'cause I was
the only gentile, I guess,
in the whole garment district.

18:26.204 --> 18:29.139
You know, except for a sprinkle
of the dagos.

18:30.408 --> 18:32.676
Which they might as well
be Jews anyhow.

18:38.382 --> 18:41.451
I'm sorry about
your not graduating.

18:41.519 --> 18:43.987
I'll tell you
something else too.

18:44.055 --> 18:47.457
If I had stood in high school
there and graduated,

18:47.525 --> 18:50.560
I might have been a pitcher
in the major leagues.

18:50.628 --> 18:53.197
You wanted to be
a baseball player?

18:53.264 --> 18:55.699
That's right, Edith.
I'll tell you something else.

18:55.767 --> 18:58.736
When I was on
that high school team,
I was very, very good.

18:58.803 --> 19:01.638
I had a hell of an arm
when I was a kid then.

19:01.706 --> 19:06.009
That was my one big dream--
pitch for the New York Yankees.

19:06.077 --> 19:10.513
Let me warm up your coffee.
No, no, no, it's fine.
It's fine.

19:10.581 --> 19:14.551
Yeah, I guess most people
wanna be something else.

19:14.619 --> 19:19.223
What did you ever wanna be,
Edith? Anything?

19:32.771 --> 19:34.704
No. No.

19:37.642 --> 19:39.843
No, I didn't,
but my mother did.

19:41.012 --> 19:42.679
Oh, your mother, huh?
What'd she want?

19:42.747 --> 19:47.584
She wanted to be the mother
of a tap dancer.

19:47.652 --> 19:49.286
<i>Huh?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:49.353 --> 19:54.624
She got the idea from those
old Shirley temple movies.
You know.

¶ [ humming ]
Yeah, I remember. I remember.
I remember! I remember.

20:07.071 --> 20:11.809
She used to say to me,
"Edith--" that's what
she always called me.

20:16.881 --> 20:20.650
"If Shirley temple can do it,
so can you.

20:20.718 --> 20:24.387
You're much prettier
than she is, and you got
just as much talent."

20:30.661 --> 20:33.931
You know how mothers are.
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

20:33.998 --> 20:38.702
I remember she bought me
a pair of black
patent leather tap shoes,

20:38.769 --> 20:42.105
and she took me
to miss Jeanette's
school of the dance.

20:42.173 --> 20:44.107
A dollar an hour.

20:44.175 --> 20:48.946
But miss Jeanette
gave my mother her money back
after the second lesson.

20:51.649 --> 20:56.186
- You wanna know why?
- Yeah, I'm waiting to hear.

20:56.254 --> 20:59.556
Whenever I tried to tap,

20:59.623 --> 21:02.692
my foot kept missin' the floor.

21:05.396 --> 21:08.232
All right. I guess you
had to give it up then.

21:08.299 --> 21:11.268
I mean, if your foot
never hit the floor.

21:13.704 --> 21:17.374
That's just as well.
You could never have
competed with the coloreds.

21:17.441 --> 21:20.277
They were always the best
for tap dancing.

21:20.345 --> 21:24.281
I mean, Shirley temple
was never as good as bojangles.

21:28.519 --> 21:31.154
You was always a great
ballroom dancer, Edith.

21:31.222 --> 21:33.156
I can remember
that about you.

21:33.224 --> 21:35.592
And I'm gonna prove
that to you right now.
