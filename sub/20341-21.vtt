(Bingo, Rolly speak)

01:05.875 --> 01:07.750
What are you looking for?

01:07.750 --> 01:09.208
Bob's baseball glove.

01:09.208 --> 01:10.958
Bob and his sister go

01:10.958 --> 01:13.166
to the first baseball game
every year together.

01:13.166 --> 01:15.416
So it's a good thing
we know where we buried it.

01:15.416 --> 01:17.458
The glove's down here,
somewhere.

01:17.458 --> 01:19.000
Well, I hope you find it.

01:20.166 --> 01:22.458
(grunting)

01:22.458 --> 01:24.375
-Find it?
-Not the glove,

01:24.375 --> 01:25.875
but I did find
a longer stick.

01:25.875 --> 01:27.333
(grunting)

01:27.333 --> 01:30.458
It was my longest stick. Bummer.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.125
I found the glove!

01:32.125 --> 01:34.125
No, false alarm.

01:34.125 --> 01:35.416
It's my lost squeaky ball.

01:36.583 --> 01:37.583
(ball squeaks)

01:37.583 --> 01:39.416
Was your squeaky ball.

01:39.416 --> 01:41.166
Double bummer.

01:41.166 --> 01:43.625
Whoa, oh, oh!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:43.625 --> 01:45.291
You're too rough, fellas.

01:45.291 --> 01:47.875
Why don't you try
digging gently?

01:47.875 --> 01:49.458
I didn't know
that was a thing.

01:49.458 --> 01:51.375
Watch and learn, puppies.

01:56.416 --> 01:58.333
Ooh, that is gentle!

01:58.333 --> 02:01.000
Bob:
Bingo, Rolly, Hissy!

02:01.000 --> 02:04.083
Time for breakfast!

02:10.250 --> 02:12.125
Oh, boy!
The first baseball game

02:12.125 --> 02:13.708
of the season is coming up.

02:13.708 --> 02:15.750
(baseball organ
plays "Charge")

02:15.750 --> 02:16.833
(laughs)

02:16.833 --> 02:19.458
And I'm so excited
to see my sister.

02:19.458 --> 02:21.000
She's always out of town,

02:21.000 --> 02:23.291
going to interesting
places to dig.

02:23.291 --> 02:24.416
Hm.

02:24.416 --> 02:26.458
I've gotta go find my glove.

02:26.458 --> 02:29.333
Sounds like Bob's sister
likes digging as much as we do.

02:29.333 --> 02:31.208
Bonnie is an archaeologist.

02:31.208 --> 02:33.333
It's her job to dig.

02:33.333 --> 02:34.375
Best job ever!

02:34.375 --> 02:35.833
Oh, yes!

02:35.833 --> 02:39.291
Archaeologists dig up very old
things called artifacts

02:39.291 --> 02:41.708
to study how
people lived long ago.

02:42.708 --> 02:45.583
Hm, that glove has gotta
be here somewhere.

02:45.583 --> 02:46.958
-Let me see.
-(computer chimes)

02:46.958 --> 02:49.250
(gasps)
Oh, Bonnie's calling!

02:49.250 --> 02:50.458
-(laughs)
-(barking)

02:50.458 --> 02:52.583
(computer chimes)

02:55.458 --> 02:58.250
-Scoot over, camel.
Trying to make a call here.
-(camel groans)

02:58.250 --> 03:00.625
Bobby,
how's my favorite brother?

03:00.625 --> 03:02.291
Is that Bingo and Rolly?

03:02.291 --> 03:04.000
Ah! Hi, guys!

03:04.000 --> 03:05.458
(barking)

03:05.458 --> 03:06.625
Hi, Bonnie!

03:06.625 --> 03:09.458
Oh, we're so excited
to see you this weekend.

03:09.458 --> 03:12.166
(sighs) Actually,
that's why I'm calling.

03:12.166 --> 03:13.458
I'm at a digging site

03:13.458 --> 03:15.708
in the hills
searching for artifacts.

03:15.708 --> 03:17.250
I found some.

03:17.250 --> 03:20.166
Great gears! That's amazing!

03:20.166 --> 03:23.500
But the two most important
artifacts we're hoping to find

03:23.500 --> 03:24.875
are still missing.

03:24.875 --> 03:26.875
And I can't leave
until I find them.

03:26.875 --> 03:29.458
But, Bonnie,
the game is this weekend.

03:29.458 --> 03:31.333
I know!

03:31.333 --> 03:33.333
So if I don't find
the artifacts today,

03:33.333 --> 03:35.875
I won't have enough time
to make it to the game.

03:35.875 --> 03:37.416
I'm sorry, Bobby.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.625
(laughs)
I'll call you back later.

03:42.625 --> 03:45.375
-(computer chimes)
-Oh, I guess I don't
need my glove after all.

03:45.375 --> 03:48.000
No point in going to the game
without Bonnie.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.583
Oh, boy.

03:49.583 --> 03:50.708
First year
we won't have

03:50.708 --> 03:53.833
a brother-sister photo
at the baseball game.

03:53.833 --> 03:57.000
Poor Bob. I wish
there was something
we could do to help.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.375
Maybe there is.

03:58.375 --> 04:01.500
Bonnie needs help digging,
and we're great diggers.

04:01.500 --> 04:02.708
Oh, yeah!

04:02.708 --> 04:04.625
If we can help her
find those artichokes--

04:04.625 --> 04:05.708
Artifacts.

04:05.708 --> 04:07.416
Yeah, that's what I said.

04:07.416 --> 04:08.625
Then she'll come
to the game

04:08.625 --> 04:10.875
and Bob will be happy
and make a face like this:

04:10.875 --> 04:13.125
Digging mission here we come!

04:13.125 --> 04:14.583

Rolly (gasps):
Those are the hills
Bonnie talked about.

04:50.875 --> 04:53.333
Bingo: Let's ask
those donkeys over there
if they've seen her.

04:54.708 --> 04:57.333
What has ears, a tail,
and four wheels?

04:57.333 --> 04:58.625
I don't know, what does?

04:58.625 --> 05:00.625
A donkey on a skateboard.

05:00.625 --> 05:03.458
-Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
-(both laughing)

05:03.458 --> 05:05.750
Excuse us, my name
is Bingo.

05:05.750 --> 05:07.333
And this is my brother, Rolly.

05:07.333 --> 05:10.125
He's Push, I'm Pull,
it's nice to meet you.

05:10.125 --> 05:11.458
We were just wondering

05:11.458 --> 05:13.250
if you've seen any
archaeologists around here?

05:13.250 --> 05:16.458
Nope, just people digging up
old stuff to put in museums.

05:16.458 --> 05:18.125
That's what
an archaeologist does.

05:18.125 --> 05:19.708
Oh. Then yes!

05:19.708 --> 05:21.416
Yeah, as a matter of fact,

05:21.416 --> 05:23.208
lately there's been one digging
at the top of that hill

05:23.208 --> 05:24.250
where the ruins are.

05:24.250 --> 05:26.250
She's got frizzy red hair.

05:26.250 --> 05:28.416
That's definitely Bonnie!

05:28.416 --> 05:30.000
So that's where
we need to go.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Thanks, Push and Pull!

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Hey, Push,
why did those puppies
run up the hill?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.291
Hm, why?

05:36.291 --> 05:38.500
To look for an archaeologist!

05:38.500 --> 05:40.625
Both:
Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

05:40.625 --> 05:41.875
Push:
I don't get it.

05:43.375 --> 05:46.000
Uh-oh! Is this too steep
for puppies to climb?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.708
Not puppies who have
grappling hooks

05:47.708 --> 05:50.583
in their collars.
(grunting)

05:55.708 --> 05:59.458
(both grunting, laughing)

06:02.291 --> 06:03.458
Ah!

06:04.875 --> 06:07.875
(both grunting)

06:07.875 --> 06:11.708
This part of the ground
is really hard to walk on.

06:11.708 --> 06:14.250
Hee-haw!
Having a little trouble there?

06:14.250 --> 06:15.500
Oh, hi!

06:15.500 --> 06:19.583
Yeah, this rocky trail
is really rocky.

06:19.583 --> 06:23.166
Us donkeys are great
at climbing rocky trails.

06:23.166 --> 06:24.625
-Hop in!
-Thanks!

06:24.625 --> 06:26.166
(Rolly, Bingo grunting)

06:26.166 --> 06:28.000
Hold on to your tails!

06:28.000 --> 06:30.708
Off we go!

06:30.708 --> 06:32.625
Who's up for some jokes?

06:32.625 --> 06:34.583
-Knock-knock.
-Who's there?

06:34.583 --> 06:35.958
(Push, Pull laughing)

06:35.958 --> 06:37.458
Okay, okay, here's another one.

06:37.458 --> 06:40.375
How does a donkey
open a door?

06:40.375 --> 06:42.000
Rolly:
With a don-key!

06:42.000 --> 06:46.083
(laughs) I love that joke!

06:46.083 --> 06:47.958
Did we tell you
that one already?

06:47.958 --> 06:49.625
Rolly: Haha, twice!

06:49.625 --> 06:50.708
But it never gets old.

06:50.708 --> 06:52.458
How much longer to the top?

06:52.458 --> 06:55.000
Who knows?
Don't worry, don't hurry.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.625
That's our motto.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.500
Except we are worried.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.375
If we don't find Bonnie soon,

07:00.375 --> 07:03.583
she won't make it
to the game and Bob will make
a sad face like this.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.625
I wouldn't want
anybody to look
that sad.

07:07.625 --> 07:08.833
Now the trail

07:08.833 --> 07:11.000
isn't as rocky here,
so it's easier to walk on.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.750
You pups ought to be fine

07:12.750 --> 07:15.166
on your own if you want
to just run ahead.

07:15.166 --> 07:17.583
-Great idea.
-Thanks for your help.

07:17.583 --> 07:20.375
Hope you find
what you're looking for!

07:20.375 --> 07:22.625
Bingo:
It's good to be
on our own four paws again.

07:22.625 --> 07:24.083
Nothing can stop us now.

07:24.083 --> 07:26.708
Bingo:
Except maybe that.

07:26.708 --> 07:29.500
When has
a little dirt stopped us?

07:33.458 --> 07:35.583
What's wrong with this dirt?

07:35.583 --> 07:37.375
Try digging faster!

07:39.583 --> 07:41.708
Actually, that's worse.

07:41.708 --> 07:43.500
Wait a minute.

07:51.708 --> 07:53.458
How are you doing that?

07:54.458 --> 07:56.833
I'm digging gently,
like Hissy does.

07:56.833 --> 07:58.500
And it's working. Try it.

08:04.875 --> 08:07.000
-Yay!
-Yahoo!

08:13.375 --> 08:14.625
We made it!

08:14.625 --> 08:16.875
And now all we have to do
is find Bonnie,

08:16.875 --> 08:18.833
then find out
what she's looking for.

08:18.833 --> 08:20.833
Then go find that stuff.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.708
So I guess we still have
a lot of finding to do.

08:22.708 --> 08:24.708
So let's get looking.

08:24.708 --> 08:26.208
Bingo:
Bonnie?

08:27.458 --> 08:30.500
(both screaming)

08:34.500 --> 08:36.750
Whoa! Where are we?

08:36.750 --> 08:39.833
I don't know,
but if we're gonna find
those artifacts for Bonnie,

08:39.833 --> 08:41.166
we need to get out of here.

08:43.625 --> 08:45.833
I think we're stuck down here.

08:46.875 --> 08:48.708
What if we don't find
Bonnie in time

08:48.708 --> 08:50.208
and she misses the game?

08:50.208 --> 08:52.708
We'll find her,
'cause that's our mission.

08:52.708 --> 08:54.875
-If we focus on--
-Ooh! Stick.

08:54.875 --> 08:56.125
Gotta get it!

08:56.125 --> 08:57.750
So much for focus.

08:59.708 --> 09:01.000
Dig gently, Rolly.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.875
Remember what happened
to your stick in the yard?

09:02.875 --> 09:05.000
Good call. Gentle.

09:07.416 --> 09:09.958
Like I was saying,
we can't get distracted
digging up old--

09:09.958 --> 09:11.375
Bingo: Ball!

09:11.375 --> 09:15.000
Careful, Bingo.
Remember what happened
to the ball at home?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.958
Right. Gentle.

-(rumbling)

10:28.750 --> 10:30.416
Look, a tent!

10:30.416 --> 10:31.708
We did it!

10:34.500 --> 10:36.000
This is Bonnie's tent.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.833
We're in the right place,
Rolly. Rolly?

10:38.833 --> 10:40.500
There's no time
to play, Rolly.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.458
We gotta find
those artichokes for Bonnie.

10:42.458 --> 10:43.958
-Artifacts.
-Right.

10:43.958 --> 10:46.625
After that, we can play
with this stuff.

10:46.625 --> 10:48.875
I'll just bury them
so nobody takes them
while we're gone.

10:48.875 --> 10:51.833
Okay. We'll dig them up
again as soon as we find Bonnie.

10:51.833 --> 10:52.875
Let's go!

10:53.833 --> 10:56.500
Hey, Bob, bad news.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.750
I didn't find
the missing artifacts,
so I definitely

10:58.750 --> 11:01.083
can't come
to the baseball-- Aah!

11:01.083 --> 11:02.416
Bob:
Bonnie?

11:02.416 --> 11:03.958
I've never noticed
this before.

11:03.958 --> 11:05.875
-Bob: Are you there?
-Sweet science!

11:05.875 --> 11:08.000
The bat I've been looking for!

11:08.000 --> 11:09.333
(gasps) And the ball!

11:09.333 --> 11:11.875
Bob, I can't believe it!

11:11.875 --> 11:13.875
I just found
the missing artifacts!

11:13.875 --> 11:15.833
They were buried
right by my tent!

11:15.833 --> 11:17.291
Ha!

11:17.291 --> 11:18.875
Did you hear that, Rolly?

11:18.875 --> 11:21.000
We brought Bonnie the artifacts
she was looking for

11:21.000 --> 11:22.458
and we didn't even know it!

11:22.458 --> 11:24.416
We're even smarter
than we thought.

11:24.416 --> 11:27.750
Well, does this mean
you can come to the game
after all?

11:27.750 --> 11:29.000
It sure does, Bobby.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.958
Make sure you have
your baseball glove ready
for our photo!

11:31.958 --> 11:33.416
Both:
The baseball glove!

11:33.416 --> 11:35.458
We gotta get home
and dig it up before
Bonnie gets there.

11:36.583 --> 11:39.708
(sighs) Oh, you beautiful
piece of history.

11:39.708 --> 11:41.833
Mwah! (coughs)

11:41.833 --> 11:43.958
(laughs, sighs)

11:43.958 --> 11:47.708
-(ballpark music playing)
-(crowd cheering)

11:47.708 --> 11:49.958
-(bat cracks ball)
-Great gears!

11:49.958 --> 11:53.333
Sweet science! (gasps)
That ball's coming our way!

11:53.333 --> 11:54.583
(gasps)

11:55.708 --> 11:57.958
(crowd cheers)

11:57.958 --> 12:00.500
I can't believe I caught it!

12:00.500 --> 12:05.250
Now it's an extra good thing
Bingo and Rolly found
my baseball glove.

12:05.250 --> 12:08.291
You two definitely earned
your spot in our annual photo.

12:08.291 --> 12:09.500
Get in here!

12:09.500 --> 12:12.291
Okay, everybody say
archeology!

12:16.750 --> 12:18.875
-(Bob grunting)
-(Rolly, Bingo speaking)

12:18.875 --> 12:20.083
(crashing)

12:20.083 --> 12:21.583
-Bob: I got ya! Whoa!
-(thud)

12:21.583 --> 12:23.291
Bob:
Where are you, noisy squirrel?

12:23.291 --> 12:24.875
Do you think
Bob's going to catch it?

12:24.875 --> 12:26.291
I hope so.

12:26.291 --> 12:27.750
-Whoa!
-(loud thud)

12:27.750 --> 12:29.125
-(springing sound)
-He's fast!

12:29.125 --> 12:31.875
That sure was a loud,
squirrely squirrel.

12:31.875 --> 12:35.708
It's been running around
the attic, making all kinds
of loud noises.

12:35.708 --> 12:36.750
-(crashing)
-(springing sound)

12:36.750 --> 12:39.333
Bob:
Great gears! Ouch!

12:39.333 --> 12:41.958
(groans)
If I can't catch
that squirrel,

12:41.958 --> 12:43.583
I better keep this door closed,

12:43.583 --> 12:45.583
so he doesn't get into
the rest of the house.

12:46.583 --> 12:48.625
Oh, I've tried
everything,

12:48.625 --> 12:50.708
but it's just
too sneaky to catch.

12:50.708 --> 12:51.833
Ha!

12:53.000 --> 12:55.500
-With all the noise--
-(clanging)

12:55.500 --> 12:56.750
(springing sound)

12:56.750 --> 12:58.875
Well,
I can't concentrate.

12:58.875 --> 13:00.833
And if I can't concentrate,

13:00.833 --> 13:03.125
well, then I can't finish
this invention in time

13:03.125 --> 13:04.708
for my meeting tomorrow.

13:04.708 --> 13:07.708
Oh, maybe there's
an animal expert in town

13:07.708 --> 13:09.958
who can help me get this
squirrel out of my house

13:09.958 --> 13:11.833
and back to its home.

13:11.833 --> 13:14.750
-Wish me luck, pups.
-(crashing)

13:14.750 --> 13:15.958
(springing sound)

13:15.958 --> 13:17.958
Ah.

13:17.958 --> 13:19.208
Poor Bob.

13:19.208 --> 13:21.750
What if he can't find someone
to help catch the squirrel?

13:21.750 --> 13:24.375
Too bad we can't
just go up in the attic
and say,

13:24.375 --> 13:25.583
"Hi, Mr. Squirrel.

13:25.583 --> 13:26.750
"Can you please leave,

13:26.750 --> 13:28.708
so Bob can have
some peace and quiet?"

13:28.708 --> 13:31.291
Rolly, that's a great idea.

13:31.291 --> 13:33.166
We can just ask the squirrel.

13:33.166 --> 13:34.583
It'll be our mission.

13:34.583 --> 13:36.208
Easy as kibble pie.

13:36.208 --> 13:38.125
Wanna come
with us, Hissy?

13:38.125 --> 13:40.000
Would I have to move
from right here?

13:40.000 --> 13:41.291
Yeah.

13:41.291 --> 13:43.250
Yeah... No, I'm good.

13:43.250 --> 13:44.500
But let me know how it goes.

13:49.875 --> 13:52.500
Remember, Bob said
to close the door behind you,

13:52.500 --> 13:54.250
so the squirrel can't get
into the house.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.875
Close the door. Check.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.166
(gasps)

13:59.166 --> 14:01.500
There's more old chew toys here

14:01.500 --> 14:04.708
than a chewer could ever chew!

14:04.708 --> 14:08.416
-And chew we will,
Rolly. Chew we will.
-(toy squeaking)

14:08.416 --> 14:11.875
But first, we gotta
find that squirrel
and ask him to leave.

14:11.875 --> 14:13.083
Come on!

14:15.125 --> 14:17.500
Look, Rolly.

14:17.500 --> 14:20.250
Maybe this open window is
how the squirrel got inside.

14:20.250 --> 14:23.166
(sniffing)

14:24.458 --> 14:27.000
This place is amazing!

14:27.000 --> 14:28.875
Wait, Rolly,
we don't have time to--

14:32.875 --> 14:34.500
Ahh!

14:35.500 --> 14:37.000
Yay!

14:43.583 --> 14:46.375
-Both: Squirrel! Whoa!
-(chittering)

14:47.458 --> 14:48.958
Wait, Mr. Squirrel!

14:48.958 --> 14:50.458
(chittering)

14:52.458 --> 14:55.625
Mr. Squirrel, we're here because
Bob needs to concentrate,

14:55.625 --> 14:58.250
but he can't while
you're up here making
all this noise.

14:58.250 --> 14:59.833
(rustling)

14:59.833 --> 15:01.166
So...

15:01.166 --> 15:04.125
Well, we need you
to not be up here anymore.

15:07.291 --> 15:08.875
Maybe he doesn't
want to talk to us.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.375
Then how do
we get him out of here?

15:10.375 --> 15:13.583
We're gonna have to talk
to someone who knows
a lot about squirrels.

15:13.583 --> 15:17.416
Then it's a good thing
we know someone who knows
a lot about a lot of things.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.250
Hmm... a squirrel, eh?

15:20.250 --> 15:22.083
Well, you've come
to the right place.

15:22.083 --> 15:25.125
-I know a lot about squirrels.
-I knew it!

15:25.125 --> 15:28.416
Mm, in fact, I've got
some squirrels living
in my tree.

15:28.416 --> 15:30.208
Best climbers around.

15:31.500 --> 15:34.750
Hello, squirrel family?

15:36.125 --> 15:37.583
I guess
they're not home.

15:37.583 --> 15:39.458
Hm, come to think of it,

15:39.458 --> 15:42.083
they've been out a lot lately,
looking for something.

15:42.083 --> 15:45.500
Maybe it's acorns.
Squirrels love acorns.

15:45.500 --> 15:48.125
So what else can we try
to get that squirrel
out of Bob's attic?

15:48.125 --> 15:50.000
You'll have to catch
the little guy

15:50.000 --> 15:51.875
and take him outside yourselves.

15:51.875 --> 15:54.958
(chuckles)
I've got just the thing.

15:54.958 --> 15:57.625
-Wow!
-Bow wow!

15:57.625 --> 15:59.875
(fanfare plays)

15:59.875 --> 16:02.166
Trust me,
just set up this baby,

16:02.166 --> 16:03.875
hide, and wait.

16:03.875 --> 16:06.291
You'll catch that squirrel
in a jiff.

16:06.291 --> 16:09.250
I'm great at hiding,
not so great at waiting.

16:09.250 --> 16:10.333
I'm working on it.

16:10.333 --> 16:12.000
Thanks, Bulworth.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.166
It's not catching
any squirrels, Bingo.

16:18.166 --> 16:21.000
-(footsteps pattering)
-(gasps) Do you hear that?

16:23.875 --> 16:25.166
Rolly:
We did it!

16:25.166 --> 16:27.625
We got you, squirrel!
High paw!

16:27.625 --> 16:30.875
Hissy (muffled):
What is going on?

16:30.875 --> 16:33.125
Wow, that squirrel
sounds a lot like Hissy.

16:34.458 --> 16:36.250
(groans)

16:36.250 --> 16:38.833
This is what I get
for coming to help.

16:38.833 --> 16:41.958
Sorry, we were trying
to catch the squirrel, not you.

16:41.958 --> 16:43.875
If you can't catch him,

16:43.875 --> 16:46.166
get him to run
out of here by himself.

16:46.166 --> 16:48.166
But how, Hissy? How?

16:48.166 --> 16:50.250
Maybe he'll chase
something out of the attic.

16:50.250 --> 16:53.333
Hey, yeah, everybody loves
to chase things.

16:53.333 --> 16:55.375
Then let's give that squirrel
something to chase.

17:01.250 --> 17:04.208
Looky, squirrel,
get the acorn.

17:10.583 --> 17:13.250
ARF will clean up
the acorn mess.

17:16.458 --> 17:19.250
Oh! Silly acorn.

17:19.250 --> 17:22.375
This squirrel better start
chasing soon.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.375
We're almost out of nuts.

17:24.375 --> 17:28.166
Oh, it will, as long as
we don't do anything
to make it run away.

17:32.208 --> 17:34.708
(rumbling)

17:34.708 --> 17:37.166
ARF saved the acorns.

17:37.166 --> 17:39.958
-(squirrel squealing)
-(ARF screaming)

17:43.375 --> 17:45.458
Whoa!
Tickley feet, tickley feet.

17:45.458 --> 17:47.333
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
-(crash)

17:48.416 --> 17:49.833
(chittering)

17:49.833 --> 17:51.333
It's headed for the door!

17:52.875 --> 17:56.125
No!

17:56.125 --> 17:59.333
(chittering)

18:02.625 --> 18:05.208
This is not good.

18:07.375 --> 18:09.625
ARF is coming!

18:11.458 --> 18:13.500
ARF is stuck.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.875
Not that way, Mr. Squirrel!

18:15.875 --> 18:17.708
(fast rock beat playing)

18:19.833 --> 18:21.458
Both:
Catch that squirrel, whoo!

18:26.166 --> 18:27.708
Both:
Catch that squirrel, whoo!

18:27.708 --> 18:30.000

18:30.000 --> 18:32.625

18:37.333 --> 18:38.625
(screeches)

18:38.625 --> 18:39.958
Both:
Sorry, Hissy!

18:39.958 --> 18:42.291
Don't mind me,
I'm just napping here.

18:42.291 --> 18:45.125
Rolly, Bingo:
Catch that squirrel, whoo!

18:45.125 --> 18:46.583
Bingo:
This way, this way!

18:46.583 --> 18:48.583
-Faster!
-Over here, Rolly!

18:48.583 --> 18:49.708
Over there, over there!

18:49.708 --> 18:51.000
Rolly:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:51.000 --> 18:53.416
Almost got it! Ow!

18:53.416 --> 18:54.875
Rolly, that's my tail!

18:58.416 --> 19:00.250
Rolly, Bingo:
Catch that squirrel, whoo!

19:01.708 --> 19:03.375
Well, this is
double not good.

19:03.375 --> 19:04.958
Mr. Squirrel!

19:04.958 --> 19:07.333
Please, please come down.

19:07.333 --> 19:09.500
(musical instruments playing)

19:09.500 --> 19:14.750
(groans) What's a cat
gotta do to get five minutes
of nap time around here?

19:14.750 --> 19:16.583
Bob will be home soon,

19:16.583 --> 19:18.625
and now we won't
have peace or quiet

19:18.625 --> 19:19.875
like he wanted.

19:19.875 --> 19:22.333
All because
we couldn't finish
our mission.

19:22.333 --> 19:24.333
Hey, don't talk like that.

19:24.333 --> 19:25.625
You'll get the squirrel down.

19:25.625 --> 19:28.583
My puppy brothers
always figure out a way.

19:30.333 --> 19:32.708
Why didn't you say
it was a baby?

19:32.708 --> 19:33.833
It's a whatsit?

19:33.833 --> 19:35.750
(chittering)

19:35.750 --> 19:38.333
Hey! You're not
a Mr. Squirrel at all.

19:38.333 --> 19:40.458
You're an itty-bitty
baby squirrel!

19:40.458 --> 19:42.583
It's not that
he didn't want
to talk to us.

19:42.583 --> 19:44.458
He couldn't talk to us.

19:44.458 --> 19:46.250
Because baby's can't talk.

19:46.250 --> 19:48.500
Oh, he should be
with his family.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.416
Maybe he's lost.

19:50.416 --> 19:52.375
Then let's get him down
and back to his family.

19:52.375 --> 19:53.625
But how?

19:53.625 --> 19:56.458
We can't just
climb up there like squirrels.

19:56.458 --> 19:59.416
Wait a sec.
I think I know
who could help us.

19:59.416 --> 20:00.708
You guys keep trying
to get him down.

20:00.708 --> 20:02.125
I'll be right back.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.000
Excuse me,
squirrel family?

20:06.000 --> 20:07.458
Yes?

20:07.458 --> 20:09.500
My name's Bingo,
I'm a friend of Bulworth's.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.083
And I need your help
with a climbing issue.

20:11.083 --> 20:13.583
Awful sorry, little puppy,
but we don't have time to help.

20:13.583 --> 20:15.750
We're looking for
our baby squirrel.

20:15.750 --> 20:17.875
(angelic voices sing)

20:17.875 --> 20:19.708
Did you say baby?

20:19.708 --> 20:21.125
We've looked everywhere

20:21.125 --> 20:22.833
and thought maybe
he came back here.

20:22.833 --> 20:24.500
He's been gone all day.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.875
We're worried sick.

20:25.875 --> 20:28.500
If you come with me, I might
be able to help with that.

20:30.458 --> 20:31.458
Really?

20:31.458 --> 20:33.458
But we've gotta hurry!
Follow me!

20:39.458 --> 20:41.250
(sirens wailing)

20:41.250 --> 20:43.416
(musical instruments playing)

20:43.416 --> 20:45.125
We've got good news
and bad news.

20:45.125 --> 20:48.500
Good news:
the box and stick trap
still works.

20:48.500 --> 20:51.166
Bad news: we're stuck.

20:52.875 --> 20:54.375
Thanks.

20:54.375 --> 20:56.708
We were trying
to get the squirrel down
while you were gone.

20:57.958 --> 21:00.583
(chittering)

21:00.583 --> 21:02.833
Both: Baby!

21:04.583 --> 21:06.625
It-- It's too slippery.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.291
We'll give you a boost.

21:12.583 --> 21:14.875
Double pup power
plus Hissy power

21:14.875 --> 21:16.458
equals... yeah!

21:21.000 --> 21:22.458
(all chittering)

21:22.458 --> 21:23.875
-Whoa.
-Wow!

21:29.458 --> 21:31.583
We were so worried about you.

21:31.583 --> 21:34.458
Thank you, pups,
for saving our baby.

21:34.458 --> 21:36.125
-You're welcome.
-It was fun.

21:36.125 --> 21:39.000
Now we just have to figure out
what to do about this mess.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.333
ARF will save you!

21:40.333 --> 21:42.083
(crashes)

21:42.083 --> 21:44.000
ARF loves to clean!

21:45.458 --> 21:47.250
(gasps) It's Bob!

21:47.250 --> 21:50.500
Hey, guys,
taking a couch nap, huh?

21:50.500 --> 21:53.000
Well,
the animal expert was busy,

21:53.000 --> 21:55.375
I don't know what I'm gonna do
with all this noise--

21:56.708 --> 21:59.750
Hey, I'm not hearing any noise.

21:59.750 --> 22:02.458
(gasps)
Maybe the squirrel's gone.

22:02.458 --> 22:04.000
I'll go check.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.416
(barking)

22:07.500 --> 22:08.875
Squirrel?

22:08.875 --> 22:10.458
Are you there?

22:12.125 --> 22:13.583
Oh, I can't believe it.

22:13.583 --> 22:16.458
The squirrel,
it's really gone!
(laughs)

22:16.458 --> 22:17.958
It was us, Bob!
We did it!

22:17.958 --> 22:20.458
The baby squirrel
is back with his family.

22:20.458 --> 22:22.083
(both barking)

22:24.291 --> 22:26.708
I finally have
some peace and quiet

22:26.708 --> 22:28.458
so I can finish my invention.

22:30.125 --> 22:33.208
Oh, you guys
are gonna love it!

22:33.208 --> 22:34.708
I wonder
what he's making.

22:34.708 --> 22:36.500
(whirring, clanking)

22:36.500 --> 22:39.125
And... I'm done!

22:39.125 --> 22:42.458
(laughs) These are gonna wow
them at the meeting tomorrow.

22:42.458 --> 22:46.000
Best inventions ever!

22:46.000 --> 22:50.458
(playing musical instruments)

22:50.458 --> 22:52.416
(laughs)

22:52.416 --> 22:54.375
I'm a one-pup marching band.

22:54.375 --> 22:55.958
Hey, you guys
sound great.

22:55.958 --> 22:58.583
I'll get my ukulele
so I can play along.

23:03.375 --> 23:05.291
We're on our way
back to Bulworth's,

23:05.291 --> 23:07.000
and we wanted to stop
and say bye.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.458
Both: Thanks, pups.

23:08.458 --> 23:09.750
Bye, squirrel family.

23:09.750 --> 23:11.125
Bye, bye, puppies.

23:11.125 --> 23:13.000
-(both gasp)
-His first words!

23:13.000 --> 23:14.583
-(gasps)
-Whoa!

23:14.583 --> 23:17.750
Hey, looks like the squirrel
found its way back
to a good home.

23:17.750 --> 23:20.375
-Yeah, Bob, we helped.
-There was a--

23:20.375 --> 23:22.291
(both barking)

23:22.291 --> 23:23.500
All right, pups.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.000
Let's make
some noise!

23:25.000 --> 23:27.291
(playing musical
instruments)

23:27.291 --> 23:30.166
(squirrels chittering)

23:32.333 --> 23:34.083
(theme music playing)

23:35.833 --> 23:37.083
(barks)

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
(barks)

23:51.583 --> 23:52.583
(barks)

23:56.833 --> 23:58.166
(barks)
