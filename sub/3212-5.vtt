WEBVTT

00:19.052 --> 00:20.619
There's another person on Earth!

00:20.621 --> 00:21.787
I know. I know.

00:21.789 --> 00:22.321
Hello, ladies.

00:22.323 --> 00:23.956
What's gotten

00:23.958 --> 00:24.957
into you?

00:24.959 --> 00:26.392
I'm so horny,
Phil. The only man

00:26.394 --> 00:28.394
left on the face
of the Earth and he's married.

00:32.332 --> 00:35.034
(thunder rumbling)

00:38.838 --> 00:40.906
(vehicle approaching)

00:51.051 --> 00:53.118
(engine revving)

01:06.166 --> 01:08.233
(engine revving)

01:16.609 --> 01:19.611
CAROL: And then he said,
"Have you ever heard the phrase

01:19.613 --> 01:21.613
"'I wouldn't have sex with you

01:21.615 --> 01:24.016
if you were the last person
on Earth'?"

01:24.018 --> 01:26.351
And then two days later
somebody changed his tune.

01:26.353 --> 01:28.187
Didn't you, you
little tunesmith?

01:28.189 --> 01:31.090
Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.
God...

01:31.092 --> 01:32.291
That's really...

01:32.293 --> 01:33.859
Romantic? Yeah.

01:33.861 --> 01:36.528
Melissa, I am so
happy you're here.

01:36.530 --> 01:37.729
Me, too.

01:37.731 --> 01:38.931
Me, too.
It's so nice
to have

01:38.933 --> 01:40.766
a girlfriend to talk to.
I'm not only

01:40.768 --> 01:43.535
your girlfriend.
I will be your BFF.

01:43.537 --> 01:44.703
You have no choice.

01:44.705 --> 01:45.938
Girlfriends!

01:45.940 --> 01:47.639
Mm-hmm.
Uh-oh.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.641
I need a refresher.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.243
Should I get
another bottle?

01:51.245 --> 01:51.944
PHIL:
For sure. For sure.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.479
Take off and... Yeah.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.414
Okay, okay.
Why not?

01:55.416 --> 01:58.050
We're having fun.

01:58.052 --> 02:00.052
Yeah. Hey,

02:00.054 --> 02:02.754
you know what, I had such
a great time last night.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.890
Oh, God. I'm so embarrassed.

02:04.892 --> 02:07.159
Oh, my God. I-I don't remember
you saying anything

02:07.161 --> 02:08.327
you should be embarrassed about.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.562
No, I did.
I mean, I said I was...

02:10.564 --> 02:12.231
You were horny.
Yeah, I-I remember.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.799
(chuckles)

02:13.801 --> 02:15.234
Well, I was drunk

02:15.236 --> 02:16.635
and feeling s...
Well, but, I mean,
not that drunk.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.669
We were both drinking.

02:17.671 --> 02:18.971
Neither of us...
I was drunk

02:18.973 --> 02:20.506
and feeling sad
for myself.
Were you? Okay.

02:20.508 --> 02:21.740
You didn't tell Carol, did you?

02:21.742 --> 02:23.108
No. No way.

02:23.110 --> 02:26.078
Hey, you and I can have
our own little secrets, huh?

02:26.080 --> 02:29.081
Okay, good. I just wouldn't
want her to get the wrong idea.

02:29.083 --> 02:30.616
Yeah, we wouldn't want that.
And I know

02:30.618 --> 02:33.252
you guys have a weird situation
with your marriage and all,

02:33.254 --> 02:35.120
but...
Yes, very weird.
And I actually wanted

02:35.122 --> 02:36.455
to talk to you about that.
But I think

02:36.457 --> 02:38.157
it's really great
that you're going for it,

02:38.159 --> 02:39.992
and I really respect you
for that.
Well, thank you.

02:39.994 --> 02:41.460
But going for it
might be a little...
Phil, just take

02:41.462 --> 02:44.363
the compliment.
You're one of the good guys.
Uh...

02:44.365 --> 02:45.831
Yeah.
You care
about your marriage.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.099
Obviously.

02:47.101 --> 02:48.800
And I love that.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.169
Because I got cheated on.

02:51.371 --> 02:52.971
Cheaters can go to hell.

02:52.973 --> 02:56.008
Okay. Prosecco
delivery.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.010
Here you go, lady.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.778
Mmm.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.813
Okay.

03:01.815 --> 03:03.182
One last
glass.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.449
To girlfriends.

03:04.451 --> 03:05.951
To girlfriends.
Cheers.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.219
Cheers.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.657
Wow.

03:11.659 --> 03:12.958
Uh-oh.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.294
This Prosecco's
making me frisky.

03:15.296 --> 03:18.363
Wink, wink.
Frisky for sex.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.565
Come on, Phil.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.366
When duty calls, huh?

03:21.368 --> 03:25.137
Committed to this marriage.
Wink, wink.
(chuckles)

03:25.139 --> 03:27.005
You guys have fun.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.807
(Carol sighs)
PHIL:
<i>Carol, I-I think</i>

03:28.809 --> 03:31.143
we might have to cut down on
the public displays of affection

03:31.145 --> 03:33.512
for a bit.
What? Why?

03:33.514 --> 03:35.514
I'm proud
that you're my husband,

03:35.516 --> 03:37.482
and I want to revel in it.

03:37.484 --> 03:40.319
Yeah, but, hey, hey,
think about Melissa.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.853
I mean, how would you feel
if you had to watch

03:41.855 --> 03:43.355
Melissa and I make out
all the time?

03:43.357 --> 03:44.923
Would you be okay with that?

03:45.692 --> 03:46.692
I mean...

03:46.694 --> 03:47.693
would you be okay with that?

03:47.695 --> 03:48.694
No.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.028
Okay. That's what I thought.

03:50.030 --> 03:50.996
So...

03:50.998 --> 03:52.898
should we get to it?

03:52.900 --> 03:54.066
Carol, are you sure

03:54.068 --> 03:55.400
we're not rushing
into this whole...

03:55.402 --> 03:57.236
"having a baby" thing?
No.

03:57.238 --> 04:00.072
Phil, this is the most important
thing we can do

04:00.074 --> 04:01.506
for the world.
I know.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.675
We need to make babies
for the human race to survive.

04:03.677 --> 04:04.810
As many babies as possible.

04:09.015 --> 04:11.083
PHIL:
<i>We need to have as many babies</i>
<i>as possible.</i>

04:11.085 --> 04:14.253
Those were Carol's exact words.
And then it hit me.

04:14.255 --> 04:15.887
Okay.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.122
Now let's say that, Kevin,

04:17.124 --> 04:19.057
you're having a baby
with Antawn.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.425
Okay?

04:20.427 --> 04:22.027
This gum is your baby.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.062
Congratulations.
Now, this whole

04:24.064 --> 04:28.267
repopulation thing grinds to
a halt until that baby is born.

04:28.269 --> 04:29.735
Unless...

04:29.737 --> 04:33.805
unless Kevin also impregnates

04:33.807 --> 04:35.707
Trevor.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.943
There you go.
You're gonna be a great dad.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.544
Anyway, don't you see?

04:39.546 --> 04:41.747
As many babies as possible

04:41.749 --> 04:44.950
means there have to be two balls
pregnant at any given time.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.386
So therefore--
and this is the whole reason

04:47.388 --> 04:48.920
I brought you here, listen up--

04:48.922 --> 04:51.323
I should be impregnating
both Carol and Melissa

04:51.325 --> 04:52.924
for the good of humanity.

04:52.926 --> 04:56.128
Ah. But how do I get them
on board?

04:56.130 --> 04:58.463
I got to play this real careful.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.265
Nothing crazy.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.100
(knocking)
Hey, neighbor.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.902
Hey. How was last night?

05:03.904 --> 05:05.904
Great. Great.
Just doing our civic duty.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.140
Uh, speaking of which,
you're generally in favor

05:08.142 --> 05:09.508
of saving the human race, right?

05:09.510 --> 05:10.742
Of course.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.078
That's good to know.
Good to know.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.480
So did you need something

05:15.482 --> 05:16.748
or...
Oh, yeah.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.117
Uh, just came by
to get your read on these pants.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.419
What do
you think?

05:22.922 --> 05:25.924
They're good. Good pants.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.993
Yeah? Yeah? But isn't there
some kind of weird rule

05:27.995 --> 05:29.995
that you're not supposed
to wear white after Labor Day?

05:29.997 --> 05:32.030
Or some restrictive rule
like that?

05:32.032 --> 05:34.599
Yeah, but I think you're fine.

05:34.601 --> 05:37.502
So just... shirk that rule?
Just chuck it out?

05:37.504 --> 05:39.104
I won't tell anyone
if you don't.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.940
Good. Good.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.543
Good. Is that all?

05:44.545 --> 05:46.445
I-I'm kind of busy.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.113
No, not yet.
'Cause I was just thinking,

05:48.115 --> 05:50.782
how crazy is it that there was
a time when Rosa Parks

05:50.784 --> 05:52.951
couldn't sit on a bus wherever
she wanted to, you know?

05:52.953 --> 05:54.453
And then just
one day

05:54.455 --> 05:55.821
she just said, like, "No.

05:55.823 --> 05:58.457
No way. I'm gonna sit
wherever I want to."

05:58.459 --> 06:00.625
You know? Hey,
to Rosa Parks

06:00.627 --> 06:03.061
and everyone like her
who believes in change.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.497
(clicks tongue)

06:05.499 --> 06:07.566
So would it be safe to say
that, leaving this conversation,

06:07.568 --> 06:10.569
I would not be crazy to describe
you as an open-minded person

06:10.571 --> 06:11.903
who believes in change

06:11.905 --> 06:14.306
and is generally in favor
of repopulation?

06:14.308 --> 06:16.708
Yeah.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.410
I'm the exact same way.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.879
Enjoy that corn.

06:22.081 --> 06:26.151
(crying):
Carol! Carol! Are you here?!

06:27.086 --> 06:29.354
(normally):
Carol?

06:29.356 --> 06:30.255
Phil?

06:30.257 --> 06:32.257
(crying):
Oh, Carol!

06:32.259 --> 06:34.059
What's going on?
Are you okay?

06:34.061 --> 06:37.062
No, Carol! No, I'm not okay!

06:37.064 --> 06:39.564
Calm down. Calm down.
Just have a seat

06:39.566 --> 06:41.833
and tell me what's
going on, Phil.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.568
Just sit down.
Just calm down.
What am I gonna do?

06:43.570 --> 06:46.271
Calm down. Just use your words.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.873
(steadying breaths)

06:47.875 --> 06:51.176
Okay, so I was just going
about my day, you know,

06:51.178 --> 06:53.445
thinking about how
we might've made a baby

06:53.447 --> 06:55.514
and how freakin' excited I am
about it.

06:55.516 --> 06:59.751
You know, w-we both know
how important repopulation is.
Of course. Of course.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.087
And then I just had
the worst thought.

07:03.689 --> 07:06.191
(sobbing):
Carol, I don't know
what to do...

07:06.193 --> 07:07.692
(sobbing)

07:07.694 --> 07:09.694
Shh...

07:09.696 --> 07:10.762
Just calm down.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.532
Just use your words.
You got this.

07:13.534 --> 07:16.868
I just had a moment
of sickening clarity,

07:16.870 --> 07:19.304
and I just was forced
to ask myself

07:19.306 --> 07:23.108
a question that no future parent
should deserve to ask themself.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.943
(sighs)
What question?

07:24.945 --> 07:28.747
Carol, do you want our babies

07:28.749 --> 07:31.550
to have sex with each other?

07:31.552 --> 07:33.385
No, Phil!

07:33.387 --> 07:37.389
No.
(sobbing):
I know! I don't either!

07:37.391 --> 07:41.393
But how else can the human race
go on beyond our kids?!

07:41.395 --> 07:45.063
Okay. Shh. Okay.
We can get through this.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.399
We'll figure it out.
(sniffles)
No.

07:47.401 --> 07:49.568
I don't think
we can figure this out.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.003
There's only one solution.

07:52.005 --> 07:55.073
Oh, you found a solution?
Well, that's great.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.508
Not great.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.076
Why?

07:58.078 --> 08:00.278
The solution
is the hardest part.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.080
Why?

08:02.082 --> 08:03.748
Because...

08:03.750 --> 08:07.752
(sobbing):
I'm gonna have to have sex
with Melissa!

08:07.754 --> 08:09.321
(sobbing)

08:11.657 --> 08:14.426
(continues sobbing)

08:14.428 --> 08:16.895
Wah, wah, wah, wah...

08:20.299 --> 08:23.535
(whimpering)

08:23.537 --> 08:25.370
You want to have sex
with Melissa?!

08:25.372 --> 08:28.974
No, I don't want to have sex
with Melissa. Ew.

08:28.976 --> 08:31.543
I  <i>have</i>to have sex
with Melissa.

08:31.545 --> 08:34.112
Phil, this hurts my ears.
Carol,

08:34.114 --> 08:36.848
it hurts my lips to say it.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.950
But our backs
are against the wall here.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.318
I mean,
like you said,

08:40.320 --> 08:42.687
this Earth needs
as many babies as possible.

08:42.689 --> 08:45.190
But I meant Phil and Carol
babies.

08:45.192 --> 08:48.393
Carol, we cannot put our babies
in a situation

08:48.395 --> 08:50.228
where they have to have sex
with each other.

08:50.230 --> 08:53.231
Our babies need other babies
to have sex with.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.567
I mean, that's just
Parenting 101.

08:55.569 --> 08:58.904
Oh, God. Okay, okay.

08:58.906 --> 09:02.240
Maybe I do need to think
about this.

09:06.412 --> 09:07.979
That's my Care Bear.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.582
Be strong.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.083
We'll be strong together.

09:12.085 --> 09:15.353
Now, you take as much time
as you need to think about it.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.289
But I'll leave you with this...

09:18.691 --> 09:20.525
Do you want...

09:20.527 --> 09:22.561
our babies...

09:23.996 --> 09:25.897
...to have sex...

09:25.899 --> 09:27.966
with each other?

09:29.869 --> 09:31.603
I vote no.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.872
And Melissa does, too.

09:33.874 --> 09:36.074
Wait, you already talked
to Melissa about this?

09:36.076 --> 09:39.010
(chuckling):
No.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.112
What?
Well, then how do you
know what she thinks?

09:41.114 --> 09:43.181
You know, just picking up
little things here and there.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.616
Like what, though?
Just, like,

09:44.618 --> 09:46.084
she's generally open to change

09:46.086 --> 09:48.086
and in favor of repopulation

09:48.088 --> 09:50.288
and she's been horny.
What?!

09:50.290 --> 09:52.958
No, Carol, she's not talking
about being horny about me.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.960
It's more of
a general horniness, you know?

09:54.962 --> 09:56.361
Horny at the world.
Phil,

09:56.363 --> 09:58.363
you're the last man
on the face of the Earth.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.932
About whom else
would she be speaking?
I don't know.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.934
She could be talking
about anyone, you know?

10:02.936 --> 10:04.970
I-I'm trying to do
what's best for the Earth.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.871
You know,
you're being crazy here.

10:06.873 --> 10:08.740
I am not. You're being a skunk!

10:08.742 --> 10:10.041
You take that back.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.476
No, you're a skunk, Phil!

10:11.478 --> 10:13.745
You're just...
skunkin' around,

10:13.747 --> 10:16.147
just getting busy with
one lady and then, oh,

10:16.149 --> 10:17.482
skunkin' on down the road,

10:17.484 --> 10:19.417
just trying to get
busy with the next!

10:19.419 --> 10:22.754
What?
(scoffs)
P.U.! Your tail

10:22.756 --> 10:25.090
stinks! Get out of
here, you skunk!
What?

10:25.092 --> 10:27.392
We are done here!
But... but...

10:27.394 --> 10:31.896
And great job fixing
my door, you skunk!

10:36.402 --> 10:38.670
Hey. What's going on?

10:38.672 --> 10:39.904
What the hell
did you tell Carol?

10:39.906 --> 10:41.806
What? Nothing. What?
Oh,

10:41.808 --> 10:43.908
so she just came over and ripped
me a new one for the hell of it?

10:43.910 --> 10:45.577
I honestly don't know
what you're talking about.

10:45.579 --> 10:48.179
(stammers)
Fill me in.
What-What's going on?

10:48.181 --> 10:50.081
She said something about me
stealing her man

10:50.083 --> 10:51.516
and something about,
if I'm horny,

10:51.518 --> 10:53.151
I should go to a hardware store.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.687
Well, that's bizarre.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.422
Did you tell her
I told you I was horny?

10:57.424 --> 10:58.823
Trying to remember
the conversation.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.359
Did that come up?
Did I tell her you were horny?

11:01.361 --> 11:02.260
You are such a dick!

11:02.262 --> 11:03.962
What? Wha...? What?
Look,

11:03.964 --> 11:05.497
you married her.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.599
It may have been under crazy
circumstances, but you did it,

11:07.601 --> 11:09.534
and you have no right
to drag me into this.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.436
I know. I don't.
I'm so sorry.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.938
Look, and-and I'll be honest,
it's just coming back to me.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.106
I did say that.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.108
I told her you were horny.
I... It was

11:17.110 --> 11:18.009
a textbook slip.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.344
Well, thanks a lot.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.879
She was my one chance
at having a girlfriend,

11:20.881 --> 11:22.313
and now she hates me.

11:22.315 --> 11:25.216
You had a chance to have
another girlfriend right here.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.852
Sure, I'm a guy,
but I honestly, I...

11:27.854 --> 11:30.355
I swear I never meant to come
between you and Carol.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.523
Well, it's too late.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.725
The damage is done.
Then, let's

11:33.727 --> 11:36.027
start repairing the damage.
You want to get some lunch?

11:37.129 --> 11:39.931
(sighs)

11:41.901 --> 11:43.968
Well, they both think
I'm a skunk now.

11:43.970 --> 11:46.905
Got to get back on track here,
got to do something.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.707
Think, think, think,
you damn skunk.

11:51.410 --> 11:52.911
(lively music playing)

11:54.313 --> 11:56.481
(over bullhorn):
All right, ladies,

11:56.483 --> 11:58.650
this skunk has obviously
offended you,

11:58.652 --> 12:01.553
and now it's time for you
to turn the tables.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.722
Come on, look,
we shouldn't be fighting.

12:03.724 --> 12:06.424
We should be having fun.

12:06.426 --> 12:09.260
I mean, you can't stay mad
at me forever.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.429
I'm the last man on Earth.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.498
(engine revving)

12:25.544 --> 12:27.045
Let's get this party started,
huh?

12:27.047 --> 12:29.180
Come on out here
and dunk the guy

12:29.182 --> 12:31.082
that angered two great people

12:31.084 --> 12:34.219
who did not agree with his,
granted, solid logic,

12:34.221 --> 12:35.787
but that doesn't matter.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.455
'Cause now you can dunk him.

12:37.457 --> 12:38.890
Did you see the sign?

12:38.892 --> 12:41.659
It's time to dunk, dunk, dunk...

12:44.897 --> 12:47.432
Oh, looks like we got
a slightly faulty seat here.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.535
Just gonna reset that like so.

12:51.537 --> 12:53.638
We are GTG.
We are good to go.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.073
(laughs)

12:55.075 --> 12:58.309
When that bronco bucks you off,

12:58.311 --> 13:00.378
you just get right back
in the saddle...

13:02.815 --> 13:06.217
Yeah, definitely
hurt my foot there.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.386
Yeah, there's some blood
in the tank.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.221
Careful. Wet T-shirt contest.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.523
(laughs)

13:12.758 --> 13:14.392
Aw, damn it!

13:14.394 --> 13:17.629
I'm getting back on.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.731
It's really fun.
You guys, it's really fun.

13:19.733 --> 13:21.566
Uh, I can't even
oversell you on this.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.301
Ah, ah, here comes Melissa.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.336
Looks like someone's ready
to blow off a little

13:25.338 --> 13:28.339
steam and dunk... that... skunk!

13:28.341 --> 13:30.074
Ah, the seat held this time.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.648
Melissa, you don't want
to have some fun? Huh?

13:36.650 --> 13:38.917
Just heading to Carol's, huh?
Cool, cool, cool.

13:38.919 --> 13:42.420
Carol? Knock, knock.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.856
Well, look who it is.

13:44.858 --> 13:47.358
You're here to talk
about your horniness?

13:47.360 --> 13:49.594
Carol, the only thing I'm
horny for is your friendship.

13:49.596 --> 13:50.662
That's not what Phil says.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.697
Well, Phil is an ass.

13:52.699 --> 13:53.798
Is that Prosecco?

13:53.800 --> 13:54.799
Yeah.

13:54.801 --> 13:56.034
Look, this is
really silly.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.635
Can we just
call a truce?

13:57.637 --> 13:59.537
The last women on Earth
can't be fighting.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.942
Get in here.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.813
Three hours in.

14:08.815 --> 14:10.515
I am very, very cold.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.217
But who's complaining, huh?

14:12.219 --> 14:14.452
Still a great night
under the stars.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.554
(music distorts and stops)

14:16.556 --> 14:18.489
Okay, looks like
we lost the power there.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.358
(laughs)
But, you know, who cares?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.694
It's still a rockin' party.

14:25.030 --> 14:29.500
Why are you guys being
like this?!

14:29.502 --> 14:33.137
Trying to freakin'
make amends here!

14:33.139 --> 14:35.206
Put a lot of work into this!

14:35.208 --> 14:38.209
And I didn't do it for me.
I did it for you!

14:38.211 --> 14:41.246
Just rude.

14:41.248 --> 14:44.215
Where I come from, when somebody
tried to make amends with you,

14:44.217 --> 14:46.718
you at least acknowledged them!

14:46.720 --> 14:50.154
So disrespectful!

14:50.156 --> 14:52.357
Oh, hey, you guys.
You ready to have some fun?

14:52.359 --> 14:53.925
You want me
to jump back in there?

14:53.927 --> 14:56.227
We need to talk.

15:02.167 --> 15:04.068
Guys,

15:04.070 --> 15:06.271
look, I already said I'm sorry.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.106
I feel terrible.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.074
Although I do believe
my logic is sound.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.677
Phil,

15:12.679 --> 15:14.913
we think...

15:14.915 --> 15:17.982
that you should repopulate
with Melissa as well.

15:21.186 --> 15:23.187
This a trick?

15:23.189 --> 15:25.556
It feels like a trick.
Is it a trick?

15:25.558 --> 15:26.858
What's happening?

15:26.860 --> 15:29.727
Melissa and I had
a long talk.

15:29.729 --> 15:33.097
I just realized how important
it is to have friends,

15:33.099 --> 15:35.867
and I want my babies
to have friends, too.

15:35.869 --> 15:37.735
Also, I don't want my babies

15:37.737 --> 15:39.871
to have to have sex
with each other.

15:39.873 --> 15:42.740
And you're okay with this?

15:42.742 --> 15:44.142
I'm sitting here.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.644
Well, I'm gonna have
to think about it.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.579
My answer is yes,
so you want to say nowish?

15:48.581 --> 15:50.214
Not so fast, Phil.

15:50.216 --> 15:52.583
This is for repopulation
purposes only, so there are

15:52.585 --> 15:53.985
going to be rules.
Mm-hmm.

15:53.987 --> 15:56.087
One-- you can only have sex
with Melissa

15:56.089 --> 15:57.622
three days each month.

15:57.624 --> 15:58.423
Three days?!

15:58.425 --> 15:59.557
But that's not...

15:59.559 --> 16:01.059
Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.393
Three is great.
Three is great.

16:02.395 --> 16:03.761
During those
three days,

16:03.763 --> 16:06.164
sex can occur a maximum
of three times per day.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.566
But, mathematically,

16:08.568 --> 16:10.401
if each session
is eight hours long...

16:10.403 --> 16:12.136
CAROL:
Okay, Phil,
I would tread lightly,

16:12.138 --> 16:13.638
'cause you are walking
real close

16:13.640 --> 16:15.073
to skunk territory
right now.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.240
Watch it!

16:16.242 --> 16:18.109
Just trying
to get the rules down.

16:18.111 --> 16:21.946
With-with much respect,
continue.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.815
(sighs)

16:23.817 --> 16:25.750
Once Melissa is pregnant,

16:25.752 --> 16:28.353
no more physical contact
of any kind.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.821
And that includes sex?

16:29.823 --> 16:31.055
Yes.

16:32.524 --> 16:34.025
Phil, do you understand
the rules?

16:34.027 --> 16:36.494
Not only do I understand them.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.496
I appreciate them.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.865
'Cause this is a job
we have to do.

16:40.867 --> 16:43.067
Now, if you ladies
will excuse me...

17:00.953 --> 17:02.787
Aah! Thank you! Thank you!

17:02.789 --> 17:04.689
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

17:08.060 --> 17:10.094
Phil?

17:12.898 --> 17:14.899
Today's the day!

17:14.901 --> 17:17.235
Time to procreate with Melissa.

17:18.137 --> 17:20.304
Oh, that's today?

17:20.306 --> 17:23.174
Here. This is called
G.O.R.A.P.

17:23.176 --> 17:25.410
It stands for "good old
raisins and peanuts."

17:25.412 --> 17:28.179
Some people call it "gorp,"
but that's incorrect,

17:28.181 --> 17:30.048
because they're forgetting
about the "and."

17:30.050 --> 17:31.582
It's not a
sexy food.

17:31.584 --> 17:32.984
It's just for energy.

17:32.986 --> 17:34.419
Great.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.820
Well, you smell clean.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.022
I suppose you washed
your genitals real nice for her?

17:38.024 --> 17:40.324
Carol, come on.
Phil.

17:40.326 --> 17:42.026
Yes, I did.

17:42.028 --> 17:44.128
Good. Don't embarrass us.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.498
Also, your sex with Melissa

17:47.500 --> 17:50.835
should be vigorous but not fun,

17:50.837 --> 17:53.938
thorough but not sexy.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.840
Save the fun stuff
for your wife.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.909
Care Bear, relax, okay?

17:57.911 --> 17:59.944
This is a job to me.

17:59.946 --> 18:02.780
I'm just gonna punch in
and punch out.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.116
Punch in and punch out.

18:05.118 --> 18:08.419
Punch in, punch out.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.922
Then I'm gonna come home
to my wife.

18:13.459 --> 18:15.526
(sighs heavily)

18:17.129 --> 18:19.130
Punch in and punch out.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.331
Okay.

18:23.302 --> 18:25.703
Godspeed.

18:28.474 --> 18:31.876
(engine revving)

18:42.087 --> 18:44.655
Ah.

18:44.657 --> 18:47.125
(laughs)
This is...

18:47.127 --> 18:49.227
Whoa...
I know.

18:50.729 --> 18:53.831
Dark chocolates
for my lady.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.834
"Ignite the spank"?
No, no. It says "spark."

18:56.836 --> 18:59.103
"Ignite the spark."
Looks like it says
"Ignite the spank."

18:59.105 --> 19:01.072
Shh...

19:01.074 --> 19:02.940
Just relax and chew.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.742
Relax and chew.

19:04.744 --> 19:05.943
You likey?

19:05.945 --> 19:08.412
What's wrong?

19:08.414 --> 19:11.816
This is all so... romantic.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.685
I know.
I thought this was
just going to be about,

19:14.687 --> 19:16.587
you know, the stuff Carol said.

19:16.589 --> 19:20.258
Repopulation,
our duty to mankind.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.292
Are you not into it?

19:21.294 --> 19:22.627
Oh, I'm into it.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.328
I haven't been with a man
in a long time.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.830
I just feel guilty
about Carol.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.799
So, let's just cut the BS
and get to it.
I mean,

19:28.801 --> 19:31.035
if the lady wants to cut the BS
and get into it, I'm gonna...

19:31.037 --> 19:32.503
Thank you.
Ooh!

19:32.505 --> 19:34.372
Oh, wait, wait.

19:34.374 --> 19:35.606
I just have one
more thing.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.275
Phil, come on.
No.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.677
You're gonna love this. I-I just
want tonight to be special.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.712
It already is!
Trust me. You'll see.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.781
You'll see.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.684
Oh, God, please don't play me
a song on the guitar.

19:46.686 --> 19:50.788
Okay. Well, then, how about
I just do this?

19:50.790 --> 19:52.690
(plays note)

19:54.159 --> 19:57.495
(laughs)

19:57.497 --> 19:58.863
Amazing.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.031
Now get back here.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.532
Hang on. Patience!

20:01.534 --> 20:02.733
I got one more.

20:02.735 --> 20:05.369

(engine revving,
tires squealing)

20:13.912 --> 20:15.980
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

20:26.692 --> 20:29.026
Now it's time for
the real fireworks.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.828
And it's gonna
be all finale.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.563
Phil, did you shave your chest?

20:32.565 --> 20:35.866
Sure did. Did
you shave yours?

20:35.868 --> 20:37.768
JK. No. But I did.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.670
Can we just do this?

20:39.672 --> 20:41.906
Just want to tell
you one last thing.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.608
From the moment...

20:43.610 --> 20:45.710
I met you...

20:45.712 --> 20:48.179
I couldn't...
(engine revving)

20:48.181 --> 20:49.680
Do you hear something?

20:51.049 --> 20:52.984
Damn it, Carol!

20:54.620 --> 20:56.854
Oh, my God.

21:09.901 --> 21:11.302
Hey.

21:12.537 --> 21:14.305
I'm Todd.
