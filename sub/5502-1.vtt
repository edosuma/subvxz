00:10.692 --> 00:12.360
<i>Great work!</i>

00:16.030 --> 00:18.164
<i>Michael is having a heart attack.</i>

00:18.199 --> 00:21.098
<i>- That's my girl!
- So...</i>

00:21.133 --> 00:24.775
<i>Take it. Take it.</i>

00:24.810 --> 00:27.552
<i>Shell. $15,000, Shell.</i>

00:27.587 --> 00:30.260
<i>I'm thinking fishing boat.</i>

00:30.295 --> 00:32.567
Oh, you might be thinking fishing boat.

00:32.603 --> 00:34.473
<i>I'm thinking a gown.</i>

00:34.508 --> 00:36.308
<i>- Nice.
- Yes.</i>

00:36.343 --> 00:39.680
<i>Well, if you went one more
and you didn't knock out the 75,</i>

00:39.715 --> 00:42.450
<i>your offer would be about 37,000,</i>

00:42.485 --> 00:45.150
<i>so there's a wedding plus a gown.</i>

00:45.185 --> 00:48.230
<i>There's no denying, Michael,
that is exceptionally good cash.</i>

00:48.265 --> 00:50.649
<i>There's no denying that the risk...</i>

00:52.151 --> 00:54.132
- You called the ambos up?
- Yeah.

00:54.167 --> 00:56.078
- What has she taken?
- Heroin.

00:56.113 --> 00:58.122
<i>But there is also no doubting</i>

00:58.157 --> 01:01.619
<i>that if you avoid it, your next offer
will be something like 25.</i>

01:01.654 --> 01:03.579
<i>No guts, no glory, I suppose.</i>

01:05.289 --> 01:07.166
<i>It's all up to you, darl.</i>

01:07.201 --> 01:09.085
<i>Think clearly, though.</i>

01:10.837 --> 01:14.882
<i>No deal!</i>

01:21.347 --> 01:23.683
<i>Look at your husband.</i>

01:23.718 --> 01:25.442
<i>So...</i>

01:25.477 --> 01:28.188
<i>I'm sorry, I don't remember
if I have actually asked number 14</i>

01:28.223 --> 01:29.654
<i>what she thought she may have.</i>

01:29.689 --> 01:31.531
- Narcan's in?
- Yes.

01:31.566 --> 01:33.575
<i>Oh, yes, you did too, didn't you?</i>

01:33.610 --> 01:36.397
<i>- Oh, lordy, lordy!
- Lots of lordy!</i>

01:42.035 --> 01:43.543
<i>Hello.</i>

01:43.578 --> 01:45.681
<i>Grandma, it's J.</i>

01:45.716 --> 01:47.784
<i>- Who?
- Josh.</i>

01:48.834 --> 01:50.801
<i>Oh, Josh!</i>

01:50.836 --> 01:52.838
<i>How are you, darlin'?</i>

01:52.873 --> 01:54.388
Yeah, good.

01:54.423 --> 01:57.968
Um, Mum's gone and OD'd
and she's died and so...

01:58.003 --> 02:00.728
<i>Are you OK?</i>

02:00.763 --> 02:02.646
Yeah, I'm OK. Sorry.

02:02.681 --> 02:05.225
I probably should have
said it a bit slower

02:05.260 --> 02:07.735
and not just go and blurt it out
like that.

02:07.770 --> 02:10.271
I don't really know
what I'm supposed to do now.

02:10.306 --> 02:12.400
<i>- Where is she?
- They took her away.</i>

02:12.435 --> 02:13.991
The ambulance came.

02:14.026 --> 02:15.618
<i>What about the cops, honey?</i>

02:15.653 --> 02:18.239
They showed up and they took
a statement and that,

02:18.274 --> 02:20.206
but I said that I was 18

02:20.241 --> 02:22.702
and now I don't really know
what I'm supposed to do.

02:22.737 --> 02:24.210
<i>Right, right.</i>

02:24.245 --> 02:25.962
They didn't say anything, you know.

02:25.997 --> 02:28.041
Like, am I supposed to organise
the funeral and that?

02:28.076 --> 02:30.126
Like, I don't know
what I'm supposed to do

02:30.161 --> 02:32.260
with all the paperwork

02:32.295 --> 02:34.714
and the arrangements
and that, you know?

02:34.749 --> 02:35.764
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:35.799 --> 02:37.863
And I remember
when Grandpa Donny died

02:37.898 --> 02:39.928
that you were on top of everything,

02:39.963 --> 02:42.646
so, you know, I called.

02:42.681 --> 02:45.801
<i>Listen, baby, hang on.
I'm coming to get you, OK?</i>

02:47.686 --> 02:49.528
Yep. Um...

02:49.563 --> 02:52.232
Do you... do you remember
where we live?

02:52.267 --> 02:54.533
<i>Of course I do, sweetheart.</i>

02:54.568 --> 02:56.525
<i>You sit tight.
I'll be right there.</i>

02:57.779 --> 02:59.489
Yep. OK.

02:59.524 --> 03:01.200
'Bye.

03:12.878 --> 03:16.681
Oh! Puffed.

03:16.716 --> 03:18.625
You got your bags packed?

03:22.889 --> 03:24.597
Come here, sweetie.

03:32.607 --> 03:34.149
Get your bags, honey.

05:58.590 --> 06:01.674
<i>Mum kept me away from her family
because she was scared.</i>

06:07.807 --> 06:09.976
<i>I didn't realise it at the time,</i>

06:10.011 --> 06:11.804
<i>but they were all scared,</i>

06:11.839 --> 06:13.597
<i>even if they didn't show it.</i>

06:17.234 --> 06:19.236
<i>I think even Barry Brown was scared,</i>

06:19.271 --> 06:22.109
<i>even though he never showed it.</i>

06:22.144 --> 06:24.947
<i>Everyone felt safe around Baz.</i>

06:26.618 --> 06:29.496
<i>He'd punch your head off
if you got in the way.</i>

06:29.531 --> 06:32.374
<i>If he was in the middle
of an armed rob and...</i>

06:32.409 --> 06:33.424
9,400.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.009
<i>you got between him and the door,</i>

06:35.044 --> 06:37.588
<i>he'd put you on the ground
and not think twice about it.</i>

06:37.623 --> 06:39.722
Morning, baby.

06:39.757 --> 06:41.550
<i>But he was good to me.</i>

06:41.585 --> 06:43.309
<i>And to everyone else.</i>

06:43.344 --> 06:46.430
You want juice?
Smurf's juicing.

06:46.465 --> 06:48.022
Hi, Uncle Darren.

06:48.057 --> 06:51.477
Seriously, you've got to stop calling me "uncle."
It gives me the creeps.

06:51.512 --> 06:54.478
<i>Darren was only a couple of years
older than me.</i>

06:56.190 --> 06:59.611
<i>When we were little Kids,
he was like my best friend.</i>

06:59.646 --> 07:01.603
<i>We used to throw rocks
at cars and that.</i>

07:03.865 --> 07:05.867
<i>He had a way better BMX than me.</i>

07:05.902 --> 07:07.386
Daisy, come here!

07:07.421 --> 07:08.835
<i>My bike was shit.</i>

07:08.870 --> 07:11.421
Come here. Good girl. Come on.

07:11.456 --> 07:13.625
- Come on, come on.
- What you doing, hon?

07:13.660 --> 07:15.790
What's it look like?
Get out!

07:15.825 --> 07:17.886
Stay there.

07:17.921 --> 07:19.304
Stay there!

07:19.339 --> 07:22.092
Oh, Mum. Fuck.
Seriously!

07:22.127 --> 07:24.810
What the fuck is going on?

07:24.845 --> 07:27.097
Who said you could bring
that noise thing in my house?

07:27.132 --> 07:28.824
- It's yours.
- It is not. Bullshit.

07:28.859 --> 07:30.517
Yes, it is.
I found it under the sink.

07:30.552 --> 07:32.609
- Do you want a juice?
- No.

07:32.644 --> 07:37.239
<i>My uncle Craig moved
really fast like...</i>

07:37.274 --> 07:39.526
<i>he was trying to stay
in front of something.</i>

07:39.561 --> 07:40.659
- Craig.
- What?

07:40.694 --> 07:42.029
- Come here.
- I'm busy.

07:42.064 --> 07:43.287
<i>And Grandma Smurf...</i>

07:43.322 --> 07:45.595
- Doing what?
- I'm just busy.

07:45.630 --> 07:47.833
Come here and give me a kiss.

07:47.868 --> 07:51.534
<i>she just seemed to want to be
wherever the boys were.</i>

07:55.209 --> 07:58.625
<i>And she just wanted to be around
whatever the boys were doing.</i>

08:04.802 --> 08:08.136
<i>But they were all scared,
even if they didn't show it.</i>

08:10.350 --> 08:12.675
<i>Even if they didn't know it exactly.</i>

08:16.106 --> 08:19.317
<i>Even if they were having to do
what crooks do all the time,</i>

08:19.352 --> 08:22.988
<i>which is block out
the thing they must know--</i>

08:23.023 --> 08:24.573
<i>they must know it...</i>

08:27.826 --> 08:31.079
<i>which is that crooks
always come undone.</i>

08:31.114 --> 08:33.130
<i>Always.</i>

08:33.164 --> 08:34.873
<i>One way or another.</i>

08:40.339 --> 08:45.344
<i>In Melbourne at this time--
this was a while ago now--</i>

08:45.379 --> 08:48.187
<i>the Armed Robbery Squad
was out of control.</i>

08:48.222 --> 08:51.058
<i>They were shooting guys willy-nilly
and getting away with it.</i>

08:51.093 --> 08:54.012
<i>And they'd been after Baz
and my family for months.</i>

08:56.647 --> 09:01.110
<i>But the guy they really wanted,
the guy they really hated,</i>

09:01.145 --> 09:03.771
<i>was my other uncle--
uncle Andrew.</i>

09:03.806 --> 09:06.398
<i>But everyone just called him Pope.</i>

09:08.534 --> 09:10.370
<i>He was hiding
in a motel room somewhere</i>

09:10.405 --> 09:12.658
<i>'cause he heard he was next.</i>

09:16.251 --> 09:17.752
These are for you.

09:17.787 --> 09:19.219
Thanks, mate.

09:19.254 --> 09:22.173
He's not here.
You guys are wasting your time.

09:22.208 --> 09:24.599
Who's not here?

09:24.634 --> 09:26.093
You know who I mean.

09:27.220 --> 09:29.343
I don't know
what you're talking about.

09:42.694 --> 09:44.633
<i>Craig was selling drugs.</i>

09:44.668 --> 09:46.538
<i>He was selling lots of them.</i>

09:46.573 --> 09:49.785
Has your brother heard the noises
Armed Robbery Squad have been making?

09:49.820 --> 09:51.085
Yeah.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.831
He said they're out to get him
so he's fucked off somewhere.

09:53.866 --> 09:57.835
<i>He had a detective in the drug squad
helping him do it.</i>

09:57.870 --> 09:59.375
<i>A guy called Randall Roache.</i>

09:59.410 --> 10:00.845
Is this the Anderis gear?

10:00.880 --> 10:02.923
No, that's half.
The other half's still in lockup.

10:02.958 --> 10:04.967
We'll talk about it later, mate.
My kid's in the car.

10:05.002 --> 10:06.392
I've got to go to soccer practice.

10:06.427 --> 10:08.638
<i>They'd meet in a fish shop in Footscray</i>

10:08.673 --> 10:11.355
<i>'cause Craig loved fish.</i>

10:11.390 --> 10:13.079
What have they got against him, anyway?

10:13.114 --> 10:14.734
Well, they want him gone, mate.

10:14.769 --> 10:16.646
They don't think anything
they've done's gonna stand in court

10:16.681 --> 10:18.529
so they want to put him off themselves.

10:18.564 --> 10:20.448
And why are they going on about Pope?

10:20.483 --> 10:22.798
- What about Baz and Darren?
- Fuck, I don't know.

10:22.833 --> 10:25.078
You know what these guys are like.
They're cowboys.

10:25.113 --> 10:27.198
- They do whatever they want.
- What's he supposed to do?

10:27.233 --> 10:29.242
Just tell him to pull
his fucking head in, mate.

10:29.277 --> 10:30.792
The whole thing's
falling apart over there.

10:30.827 --> 10:33.580
Armed Robbery's about to be disbanded
and everything will just go away.

10:33.615 --> 10:35.380
Just tell him to pull
his fucking head in.

10:35.415 --> 10:38.601
His head's in. Your head doesn't get
any more in than Pope's head.

10:38.636 --> 10:41.788
Mate, even if I gave a shit,
you'd be telling the wrong bloke.

10:44.299 --> 10:45.295
Fuck!

10:46.426 --> 10:49.263
<i>And I don't know, like,
all this seems strange to me</i>

10:49.298 --> 10:51.532
<i>but not strange either.</i>

10:51.567 --> 10:53.732
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

10:53.767 --> 10:55.234
<i>Kids just are wherever they are</i>

10:55.269 --> 10:58.203
<i>and they just do
whatever they're doing, you know?</i>

10:58.238 --> 11:01.137
<i>This is where I was
and this is what I was doing.</i>

11:03.444 --> 11:08.070
<i>After my mum died, this was just
the world I got thrown into.</i>

11:10.034 --> 11:11.658
Hey, buddy. Hey!

11:13.412 --> 11:15.963
Light's green, you idiot.

11:15.998 --> 11:18.406
You got a staring problem, mate?
What the fuck you looking at?

11:19.836 --> 11:21.994
Yeah, fuckin' get me.

11:59.501 --> 12:01.211
Go get him.

12:01.246 --> 12:03.537
And do what?

12:05.048 --> 12:06.673
Let him know who's king.

12:08.552 --> 12:10.185
Come on, come outside.

12:10.220 --> 12:12.386
I'll deck ya, mate.
Come outside.

12:12.421 --> 12:14.552
Come on, idiot.
Come outside.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.611
Wha-hey-hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, brother.

12:18.646 --> 12:21.482
Just relax, man. I was just gonna
have a chat to him, alright?

12:22.900 --> 12:24.839
Just chill, bro.

12:24.874 --> 12:26.779
Fuck this, man.

12:28.531 --> 12:30.274
Fuck out of here, man!

12:37.206 --> 12:40.466
How did that feel? Huh?

12:40.501 --> 12:43.379
Did you get a little stiffy? Yeah?

12:50.804 --> 12:52.512
Bit of fun, huh?

12:53.557 --> 12:55.100
I'll give you 100 bucks.

12:55.135 --> 12:56.594
Come on!

12:58.520 --> 13:01.523
- I'll give you 100 bucks.
- Honey, people are watching.

13:01.558 --> 13:03.148
200 bucks.

13:04.735 --> 13:06.320
Would you fuckin' motivate
your girlfriend?

13:06.355 --> 13:08.989
- Mate, just let her alone.
- Yeah?

13:09.024 --> 13:11.528
OK, open up. 200 bucks.

13:11.563 --> 13:14.032
Alright. That's the way.

13:16.497 --> 13:18.547
Awesome!

13:18.582 --> 13:20.290
Fuckin' rich!

13:23.295 --> 13:25.335
Hey, so Nicole's a sweetie.

13:26.674 --> 13:28.462
Where'd you find her?

13:28.497 --> 13:30.251
Found her at school.

13:31.429 --> 13:33.681
- Where are you going?
- What?

13:33.716 --> 13:35.558
Did you wash your hands?

13:35.593 --> 13:36.983
No.

13:37.018 --> 13:39.485
You had your hands on your cock.

13:39.520 --> 13:41.731
Your hands go anywhere near
your arse or your cock,

13:41.766 --> 13:43.807
you wash them after.

13:45.193 --> 13:46.853
Jeez. Come on.

13:49.572 --> 13:51.324
Bit of soap.

13:53.243 --> 13:54.785
Yeah. Get a lather going.

13:56.871 --> 13:58.366
Rinse.

14:01.751 --> 14:03.730
Alright, that's enough.

14:03.765 --> 14:05.710
Now stick them under there.

14:09.301 --> 14:12.304
I'm invisible.
These things never see me.

14:12.339 --> 14:14.938
No-one's invisible, mate.

14:14.973 --> 14:16.681
You've got to get right up in there.

14:20.604 --> 14:22.264
There you go.

14:26.485 --> 14:28.423
Excuse me.

14:28.458 --> 14:30.362
The bill.

14:35.536 --> 14:37.244
Roache said just pull your head in.

14:39.415 --> 14:41.491
Right? You all got to
pull your heads in.

14:45.213 --> 14:47.588
Sir, there's no smoking in here.

14:47.623 --> 14:49.964
Sorry. Just doing it a little bit.

14:59.394 --> 15:00.853
They're not watching you.

15:02.522 --> 15:04.232
Can't you cut 'em in?

15:04.267 --> 15:05.907
Just give 'em a drink.

15:05.942 --> 15:09.821
It's the Armed Robbery Squad, mate.
They don't do business.

15:11.865 --> 15:14.534
Roache just says pull your heads in
and it'll all go away.

15:14.569 --> 15:16.693
Right?

15:19.122 --> 15:21.583
- Sir, you cannot smoke in here.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

15:21.618 --> 15:24.044
Alright. That's alright.
We're done here. It's good.

15:28.090 --> 15:30.933
Mum! I'm going home.

15:30.968 --> 15:34.054
Oh, darling, are you alright to drive?
You're not drunk, are you?

15:34.089 --> 15:36.008
No, I'm OK. I'm fine.

15:36.043 --> 15:37.928
Come and give us a kiss.

16:08.506 --> 16:09.973
Do you ever stop, mate?

16:10.008 --> 16:13.344
Seriously, every time I see you
you're chopping in.

16:13.379 --> 16:16.681
Why don't you try going to sleep
for once in your life?

16:16.716 --> 16:18.224
Bazza, I sleep like a baby.

16:21.812 --> 16:23.057
Want some?

16:25.273 --> 16:26.775
Oh, no, she's alright.

16:26.810 --> 16:27.866
Says you.

16:27.901 --> 16:31.238
Yeah. Don't trample her freedom, mate.

16:31.273 --> 16:33.539
Sweetheart, would you like some?

16:33.574 --> 16:36.410
We're here having a nice night
and you have to do your own thing.

16:36.445 --> 16:38.153
Well, fuckin' avert your eyes.

16:39.580 --> 16:41.505
J, can you go and get some drinks?

16:41.540 --> 16:45.669
Can you get Bazza a really big one?
Loosen him up just a little bit.

16:45.704 --> 16:47.164
Well...

16:59.433 --> 17:02.527
Oi!

17:02.562 --> 17:04.138
Are you alright, love?

17:06.566 --> 17:07.991
J?

17:08.026 --> 17:10.481
- OK, tell 'em, tell 'em.
- I'm alright.

17:11.779 --> 17:13.613
Are you sure?

17:13.647 --> 17:15.448
Guess-- who am I?

17:16.785 --> 17:18.065
Uncle Pope.

17:20.204 --> 17:22.874
- Do you know me?
- Yeah, you're Julia's kid.

17:24.291 --> 17:26.617
Better be cleaning that up in there.

17:32.259 --> 17:34.685
Ruined my surprise.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.888
They're not actually gonna shoot ya.

17:36.923 --> 17:38.564
You know that, don't you?

17:38.599 --> 17:42.186
Bet that's what they said to Mickey
and Petey... Petey Speed as well.

17:42.221 --> 17:45.439
Mate, if they had anything on us,
they would be using it.

17:45.474 --> 17:47.458
But they don't,
so then all they can do

17:47.493 --> 17:49.443
is sit in a car
outside my fucking house.

17:49.478 --> 17:51.076
Yeah...

17:51.111 --> 17:52.884
They've got bigger fish to fry.

17:52.919 --> 17:54.622
The Armed Rob's getting shut down.

17:54.657 --> 17:57.827
Half those guys will get shuffled
over to Major Crime Squad.

17:57.862 --> 17:59.960
Rest will go, you know, wherever.

17:59.995 --> 18:02.088
And their whole club
will fall to bits.

18:02.123 --> 18:04.750
All they can try and do now
is get something over on us.

18:04.785 --> 18:06.627
They got something over on you.

18:06.662 --> 18:08.086
Yeah, they made you run.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.141
You're a fuck.

18:13.176 --> 18:14.684
You don't have them out there

18:14.719 --> 18:16.644
telling people they want to knock ya.

18:16.679 --> 18:19.369
- Baz, we should go.
- Yeah, in a minute, babe.

18:19.404 --> 18:22.060
It's late. We should go.
Charlie's babysitting.

18:22.095 --> 18:24.183
Yeah, well, I'm just talking.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.280
Call Charlie.

18:27.315 --> 18:30.193
I'll pay her 1,000 bucks
if she stays over the night.

18:30.228 --> 18:33.829
Yeah, nine grand a pop's
as good as it gets now.

18:33.864 --> 18:36.533
I don't know that you've got
1,000 bucks to give the babysitter.

18:36.568 --> 18:39.119
Yeah. True.
That's not untrue.

18:42.372 --> 18:45.542
Hey, hey. Can you hear that?

18:45.577 --> 18:47.167
What?

18:50.380 --> 18:51.958
Fuckin' listen.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.630
What is it, hon?

19:02.101 --> 19:04.040
Pull my finger.

19:04.075 --> 19:05.986
Pull my finger!

19:07.933 --> 19:09.490
Mongrel!

19:09.525 --> 19:11.443
Kids, cut it out.

19:11.478 --> 19:13.327
Get off him, hon.

19:13.362 --> 19:15.521
Andrew's got my arm!

20:06.542 --> 20:08.627
- Where are you going?
- Supermarket.

20:08.662 --> 20:10.313
What to get?

20:10.348 --> 20:11.861
Not much.

20:11.896 --> 20:13.375
What?

20:14.467 --> 20:17.586
I'm gonna meet Pope.

20:20.848 --> 20:23.304
How long's that car gonna stay
parked outside our house?

20:24.769 --> 20:27.146
This is what
I'm gonna go meet him about.

20:27.181 --> 20:29.489
It's been there for a week.

20:29.524 --> 20:32.893
Yeah, well, this is what I'm gonna go
and meet him about, aren't I?

20:38.158 --> 20:40.639
Can you not pinch my arse
every five seconds?

20:40.674 --> 20:43.121
Oh, but I can't help it.
I just... I love it!

20:51.922 --> 20:53.380
See ya.

20:56.218 --> 20:58.543
- Get milk.
- Nuh!

21:04.393 --> 21:05.852
Here, mate.

21:07.104 --> 21:08.821
Take that. That's my number.

21:08.856 --> 21:10.983
That'll be my number
for the next week or so

21:11.018 --> 21:12.585
and then I'll change it every week.

21:12.620 --> 21:14.152
Right. That's your split.

21:16.196 --> 21:17.691
It's bullshit.

21:21.410 --> 21:23.237
- Sorry, love.
- Excuse me.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.919
Mate, I don't know what you're thinking
about your future and that

21:29.954 --> 21:31.413
but I'm about done with this shit.

21:34.215 --> 21:36.384
I need some sort of change.

21:36.419 --> 21:38.518
The stock market's working.

21:38.553 --> 21:41.431
You know that 20 grand
I put in there is 60 now?

21:41.466 --> 21:43.356
See, you get a foot in that door,

21:43.391 --> 21:45.024
there's serious money
to be made, you know?

21:45.059 --> 21:47.312
I don't know anything
about the stock market, mate.

21:47.347 --> 21:48.813
So what? Neither did I.

21:48.848 --> 21:50.822
Doesn't matter.

21:50.857 --> 21:52.574
You get the paper, you learn it.

21:52.609 --> 21:54.685
It doesn't matter.
Our game, it's over, mate.

21:56.196 --> 21:59.150
It's getting too hard.
It's a fucking joke.

22:03.412 --> 22:06.289
You know, Craig's making a
fucking fortune with the drug thing.

22:06.324 --> 22:07.784
You saw the house he's bought.

22:10.043 --> 22:12.546
I don't know I got that in me.

22:12.581 --> 22:14.795
It's grubby.

22:14.830 --> 22:16.795
You know? Grubby business.

22:16.830 --> 22:18.754
The stock market, mate.

22:18.789 --> 22:20.644
There's a resources boom.

22:20.679 --> 22:24.892
I'll get you started. I'll set you
an account up and you're away.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.351
Yeah, I... mate, I'm...

22:28.813 --> 22:30.518
I don't have a computer.

22:30.553 --> 22:32.223
Don't need a computer.

22:35.027 --> 22:37.363
Well, I don't know
what I'm gonna do. What...

22:37.398 --> 22:39.872
Well...

22:39.907 --> 22:42.583
either do I, is what I'm saying.

22:42.618 --> 22:44.907
But every day's a new day
is what I'm also saying.

22:46.706 --> 22:48.745
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

23:03.056 --> 23:04.699
Aw, fuck.

23:04.734 --> 23:06.343
Here we go.

23:10.272 --> 23:12.607
Oh, shit, guys, you just missed him.

23:12.642 --> 23:14.908
That's alright.
I like you better.

23:14.943 --> 23:17.232
He's got a gun!

23:40.094 --> 23:42.722
- You spoken to Cath?
- I gotta go, hon.

23:42.757 --> 23:44.647
Huh?

23:44.682 --> 23:47.138
It's OK to cry, honey.

23:48.811 --> 23:50.270
Honey, come here.

23:51.773 --> 23:53.754
Dogs!

23:53.789 --> 23:55.700
Fuck.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.652
- Fuck!
- Hey, come on, baby.

23:57.687 --> 23:59.569
Calm down. Come here. Come on.

24:30.729 --> 24:32.863
It can't happen, Nick.

24:32.898 --> 24:34.990
You're at school.
You're in year 12.

24:35.025 --> 24:37.361
He really needs somewhere, Mum.
There's things going on.

24:37.396 --> 24:39.245
- What things?
- Things.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.657
I don't know.
It'd just be for a while.

24:41.692 --> 24:43.457
You're still at school, Nick.

24:43.492 --> 24:46.127
You're probably gonna make
a mess of it as it is.

24:46.162 --> 24:48.956
And you shouldn't be asking me this
right in front of J.

24:48.991 --> 24:51.751
Why? 'Cause you don't want him
to see what a bitch you are?

24:51.786 --> 24:53.708
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

24:55.630 --> 24:58.382
Look, one of J's friends
got shot by the cops today,

24:58.417 --> 25:00.183
and he's dead, OK?

25:00.218 --> 25:03.717
And I don't think it would be
that big a deal to let him stay here.

25:09.727 --> 25:11.519
I didn't know him too well.

25:12.647 --> 25:13.988
Where was this?

25:14.023 --> 25:17.689
Um... Prahran, I think.

25:19.446 --> 25:20.774
That was on the news.

25:22.908 --> 25:26.745
I didn't know him too well. It was...
it was just a shock and everything.

25:26.780 --> 25:28.994
Well, uh, I mean, can we do anything?

25:29.029 --> 25:31.208
I mean, do you want a drink or...?

25:31.243 --> 25:33.634
No, thanks.

25:33.669 --> 25:35.745
So maybe you can think about that.

25:50.352 --> 25:53.856
<i>I'm lying alone
with my head on the phone</i>

25:53.891 --> 25:58.284
<i>Thinking of you till it hurts</i>

25:58.319 --> 26:02.865
<i>I know you hurt too
but what else can we do</i>

26:02.900 --> 26:07.168
<i>Tormented and torn apart</i>

26:07.203 --> 26:11.582
<i>I wish I could carry
your smile in my heart</i>

26:11.617 --> 26:15.593
<i>For times when my life
seems so low</i>

26:15.628 --> 26:20.049
<i>It would make me believe
what tomorrow could bring</i>

26:20.084 --> 26:24.220
<i>When today doesn't really know</i>

26:24.255 --> 26:26.980
<i>Doesn't really know</i>

26:27.015 --> 26:31.373
<i>I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you</i>

26:31.408 --> 26:35.718
<i>I know you were right
Believing for so long</i>

26:35.753 --> 26:40.028
<i>I'm all out of love
What am I without you?</i>

26:40.063 --> 26:42.037
<i>I can't be too late</i>

26:42.072 --> 26:47.493
<i>To say that I was so wrong</i>

26:48.746 --> 26:53.208
<i>I want you to come back
and carry me home</i>

26:53.243 --> 26:57.470
<i>Away from these long, lonely nights</i>

26:57.505 --> 27:01.550
<i>I'm reaching for you
Are you feeling it too?</i>

27:01.585 --> 27:05.603
<i>Does the feeling seem oh, so right?</i>

27:05.638 --> 27:10.393
<i>And what would you say
If I called on you now?</i>

27:10.428 --> 27:14.806
<i>And said that I can't hold on...</i>

27:55.397 --> 27:57.141
She's beautiful, mate.

27:59.652 --> 28:02.237
<i>You know why your mum and I</i>

28:02.272 --> 28:04.198
didn't talk for so long?

28:04.233 --> 28:06.081
No.

28:06.116 --> 28:09.369
We had a fight... about...

28:09.404 --> 28:12.588
You know the card game 500?

28:12.623 --> 28:16.752
She reckoned you can play the joker
whenever you want

28:16.787 --> 28:20.096
in a no-trumps hand.

28:20.131 --> 28:23.251
She was drunk.
I was drunk too, but I was right.

28:24.719 --> 28:26.178
So look what happens.

28:27.430 --> 28:30.799
Years go by and then she's gone.

28:32.727 --> 28:35.487
And I lose my only daughter...

28:35.522 --> 28:37.857
'cause you can't play the joker
whenever you want

28:37.892 --> 28:40.116
in a no-trumps hand.

28:40.151 --> 28:42.393
And I don't get to see you for years.

28:43.446 --> 28:46.164
That made me real sad.

28:46.199 --> 28:47.659
But I'm getting to see you now.

28:47.694 --> 28:50.031
All the time.

28:51.538 --> 28:54.705
OK. Stand up.
Let's have a look at you.

29:01.340 --> 29:02.798
Sweet!

29:03.801 --> 29:06.136
- How do I look?
- You look good.

29:06.171 --> 29:07.796
Correct.

29:11.809 --> 29:13.517
Beautiful boy.

30:18.627 --> 30:21.130
Where'd you get that suit?
What's that suit?

30:21.165 --> 30:22.624
It's a suit.

30:24.008 --> 30:25.885
What, do you think
it looks good on you?

30:25.920 --> 30:27.476
What?

30:27.511 --> 30:29.217
Looks gay. Are you gay?

30:29.252 --> 30:30.924
Fuck off, will you?

30:34.685 --> 30:36.228
It's a serious question.

30:38.314 --> 30:41.434
I don't care if you're gay
or if you're not gay, you know?

30:43.194 --> 30:44.619
It's alright if you are, mate.

30:44.654 --> 30:46.843
I just want you to tell me
about it, you know?

30:46.878 --> 30:49.266
I don't care whether
you're gay or you're not gay.

30:49.301 --> 30:51.655
I just want you to talk to me
about it, you know?

30:53.371 --> 30:55.102
Making yourself a drink?

30:55.137 --> 30:56.922
- Yep.
- What is it?

30:56.957 --> 30:58.707
It's a bourbon and coke.

31:00.378 --> 31:03.089
Bourbon and coke's
not a very gay drink, mate.

31:03.124 --> 31:05.801
I think... look, if you're a gay man,
if you are,

31:05.836 --> 31:08.738
and you want to make yourself
a gay drink,

31:08.773 --> 31:11.605
just go ahead
and make yourself a gay drink.

31:11.640 --> 31:13.850
You know what I mean?
That's what I'm talking about, mate.

31:13.885 --> 31:15.484
I just want you to tell me things.

31:15.519 --> 31:17.896
You know, it just kills me
to see you living a lie.

31:17.931 --> 31:19.723
Look, will you fuck off?
Seriously.

31:29.533 --> 31:31.193
What do you think we should do?

31:38.042 --> 31:41.376
I think we should be there
for Cath and the family and that.

31:47.552 --> 31:49.295
What are you gonna do, Darren?

31:54.851 --> 31:57.057
It's wrong and all that
but, you know...

32:01.024 --> 32:04.361
You know, if Baz
was still here right now

32:04.396 --> 32:07.996
and we'd just been to your funeral,

32:08.031 --> 32:10.273
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

32:12.244 --> 32:14.651
'Cause he'd have already
done something about it.

32:16.623 --> 32:20.241
If you don't want to do anything
because you're scared...

32:23.213 --> 32:25.778
Is it because you're scared?

32:25.813 --> 32:28.308
It's alright if you are.

32:28.343 --> 32:30.585
I just want you to tell me about it.

32:31.638 --> 32:33.265
Just talk to me.

32:47.989 --> 32:50.147
- Where's Craig?
- I don't know.

32:53.703 --> 32:55.496
I need a favour, alright?

32:55.531 --> 32:57.290
You're good with cars, yeah?

32:57.325 --> 32:58.798
- Yeah.
- OK.

32:58.833 --> 33:01.377
You go get me a Commodore
or something like that

33:01.412 --> 33:04.130
and bring it to Darren's place.

33:04.165 --> 33:06.251
Alright?

33:06.286 --> 33:08.337
At, uh, 2am.

33:11.137 --> 33:12.762
How come?

33:16.059 --> 33:17.767
'Cause I told you to.

34:00.688 --> 34:02.155
Where is it?

34:02.190 --> 34:04.313
It's parked around back.
It's a white Commodore.

34:07.028 --> 34:09.822
What are you doing that for?
What are you doing that now for?

34:09.857 --> 34:12.739
What makes you think that's
a good idea to do that now?

34:14.494 --> 34:16.533
The bag. Get the bag.

34:25.714 --> 34:27.556
Oh, and hey,

34:27.591 --> 34:29.963
anyone calls while we're out,
you tell them Darren's in the shower.

34:40.896 --> 34:42.438
I'm so sorry I'm late.

34:46.985 --> 34:48.654
See you out there, mate.

34:58.080 --> 35:00.006
Great.
Thanks, Sergeant.

35:00.041 --> 35:02.745
<i>Richmond 49, do you copy?</i>

35:04.253 --> 35:06.637
49 Richmond, we copy.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.514
<i>49, what's your current position?</i>

35:08.549 --> 35:12.393
We're heading west on Bridge Road
towards Church.

35:12.428 --> 35:15.410
<i>49, Boroondara's units
are all tied up at present.</i>

35:15.445 --> 35:18.393
<i>Can you head over
to 36 Darcy Street in Hawthorn?</i>

35:18.428 --> 35:20.318
<i>A Mrs Birnie of that address
has reported</i>

35:20.353 --> 35:22.730
<i>a white Commodore sedan
in the middle of the road.</i>

35:22.765 --> 35:24.941
<i>Says it looks stolen.
Windows are smashed.</i>

35:24.976 --> 35:26.815
Roger. We'll give it a look.

36:04.148 --> 36:06.639
- Oh, this looks like it.
- Yep.

37:19.684 --> 37:21.094
Turn around, pig cunt.

38:10.736 --> 38:11.934
Darren?

38:19.161 --> 38:21.487
- Darren, what happened?
- Go to sleep.

38:23.958 --> 38:25.417
Should I go home?

38:48.525 --> 38:49.639
Hello.

38:58.994 --> 39:01.809
<i>Oh, he's stretched out that one.</i>

39:01.844 --> 39:04.589
<i>And he's asking the question.</i>

39:04.624 --> 39:06.960
<i>A little shrug of the shoulders, uh...</i>

39:09.504 --> 39:11.346
<i>He obviously doesn't know.</i>

39:11.381 --> 39:13.872
<i>And I think that's out!</i>

39:15.844 --> 39:19.390
<i>Yes, he lifts his foot to get it back
and I think the ball is off...</i>

39:19.425 --> 39:20.898
Hey! Hey.

39:20.933 --> 39:22.676
This Sri Lankan guy here,
what's his name?

39:24.436 --> 39:27.418
It's... Muralitharan?

39:27.453 --> 39:30.401
- What?
- Muralitharan.

39:30.436 --> 39:33.362
Yeah. He's funny.

39:35.865 --> 39:38.034
Where's Craig?

39:38.069 --> 39:40.168
Oh, I don't know.

39:40.203 --> 39:42.076
Hey, who cuts your hair?

39:43.706 --> 39:45.103
Nicky.

39:45.138 --> 39:46.466
Yeah?

39:46.501 --> 39:48.956
Do you think maybe she'd cut my hair
if I asked her?

39:50.880 --> 39:52.347
Maybe.

39:52.382 --> 39:55.350
- Where are you going?
- Just gonna go to my room.

39:55.385 --> 39:58.513
Listen, you know if you ever want
to talk about anything or anything,

39:58.548 --> 40:00.021
I'm there, right?

40:00.056 --> 40:02.892
I mean, if you need help
with anything or whatever,

40:02.927 --> 40:05.810
I'd like to do that for you.

40:07.647 --> 40:09.106
Yeah. Right, OK.

41:34.862 --> 41:36.356
Good day, Josh.

41:39.491 --> 41:41.827
I'm Detective
Senior Sergeant Leckie.

41:41.862 --> 41:43.753
This is Detective Norris.

41:43.788 --> 41:46.665
Mr Harrop here's from
the Department of Human Services.

41:46.700 --> 41:48.132
It's a requirement under the law

41:48.167 --> 41:49.842
when questioning anybody
under the age of 18

41:49.877 --> 41:53.464
that they be accompanied by
a guardian or legal representative.

41:53.499 --> 41:55.723
In the absence of such a person,

41:55.758 --> 41:59.262
a department officer
such as John here must be present.

41:59.297 --> 42:01.305
I must also advise you
you're under no obligation

42:01.340 --> 42:03.022
to say anything at this point in time

42:03.057 --> 42:05.059
but anything you do say
can be used as evidence

42:05.094 --> 42:06.682
in any later court appearances.

42:06.717 --> 42:08.787
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

42:08.822 --> 42:10.986
OK. This shouldn't take too long.

42:11.021 --> 42:13.151
I've already been here for hours.

42:13.186 --> 42:14.659
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

42:14.694 --> 42:16.988
It's been a big day,
as I'm sure you can understand.

42:17.023 --> 42:18.615
Please state your full name.

42:18.650 --> 42:20.916
Joshua Daniel Cody.

42:20.951 --> 42:23.119
And do you know why
you're here, Josh?

42:23.154 --> 42:24.753
I wouldn't have a clue.

42:24.788 --> 42:28.291
Right, well, last night,
two police officers were shot dead

42:28.326 --> 42:30.389
investigating a stolen car in Hawthorn.

42:30.424 --> 42:32.453
Can you tell me
where you were last night?

42:34.631 --> 42:37.676
- I was at home.
- What's the address there?

42:37.711 --> 42:40.185
17 Harding Street, Ivanhoe.

42:40.220 --> 42:42.681
OK. What were you doing
at home last night, Josh?

42:42.716 --> 42:45.357
Just watching TV.

42:45.392 --> 42:49.772
Were your uncles at that address
with you all night last night?

42:49.807 --> 42:53.074
They were home,
but I fell asleep pretty early

42:53.109 --> 42:55.860
so I wouldn't have a clue, really,
what they were up to.

42:57.279 --> 43:00.150
Think they might've just been
watching TV, sort of thing.

43:01.284 --> 43:03.327
They were watching TV with you?

43:03.362 --> 43:05.002
They came in at some point

43:05.037 --> 43:10.084
but by that point
I was already half asleep, so...

43:10.119 --> 43:12.886
What were you watching?

43:12.921 --> 43:15.921
I think it was that
"Funniest Home Videos."

43:18.384 --> 43:21.853
I was pretty much just
having a nap on the couch.

43:21.888 --> 43:25.100
And so, at some point, all three
of your uncles came into the room?

43:25.135 --> 43:28.436
Is that right, or... or just
one of them, or... or maybe two?

43:28.471 --> 43:30.230
Can you tell me exactly
who was there?

43:30.265 --> 43:32.155
I can't really tell you. I was...

43:32.190 --> 43:34.818
I was that tired that I only remember
there were people around

43:34.853 --> 43:37.922
but, you know,
I can't say who exactly is...

43:37.957 --> 43:40.991
Basically I had my eyes shut,
sort of thing.

43:41.026 --> 43:42.651
You don't remember who you heard?

43:46.622 --> 43:48.874
The reason... the reason
I was so sleepy

43:48.909 --> 43:51.936
is 'cause I'd smoked some marijuana

43:51.971 --> 43:54.964
and... you know, I was knocked out...

43:54.999 --> 43:56.430
sort of thing.

43:56.465 --> 43:58.592
I didn't want to
have to tell you guys that.

43:58.627 --> 44:00.101
Do you remember where you were

44:00.136 --> 44:01.927
when you heard the news
of Barry Brown's death?

44:05.224 --> 44:06.649
I was home.

44:06.684 --> 44:10.122
And how did the family
take that news?

44:10.157 --> 44:13.561
I... I imagine Craig was pretty upset.

44:16.444 --> 44:18.341
Yeah, he was sad.

44:18.376 --> 44:20.225
Sad in what way?

44:20.260 --> 44:22.040
He was crying.

44:22.075 --> 44:25.989
You actually physically saw him crying?
What did you see?

44:27.539 --> 44:30.423
His face was red, he had...

44:30.458 --> 44:33.461
water coming out of his eyes
and he was rubbing them.

44:33.496 --> 44:35.537
How was he rubbing his eyes?

44:38.967 --> 44:40.426
Um, just...

44:43.263 --> 44:45.439
And, uh, what's taken place
after that?

44:45.474 --> 44:50.020
Has he said anything or made
any comments that you can recall?

44:50.055 --> 44:52.189
Oh, look, I've been smoking
a fair bit lately

44:52.224 --> 44:53.982
so my memory's pretty fucked.

44:54.017 --> 44:56.533
But...

44:56.568 --> 44:58.395
don't know, I don't think so.

45:02.658 --> 45:04.250
Is there anything else
you'd like to add

45:04.285 --> 45:06.787
in regard to these matters
we've discussed here today?

45:06.822 --> 45:08.365
No.

45:10.583 --> 45:12.883
OK, we'll suspend the interview
right there.

45:12.918 --> 45:16.537
Uh, Detective Norris and I
will be back in a tick.

45:21.886 --> 45:24.013
You want a drink or anything?

45:24.048 --> 45:25.021
No.

45:25.056 --> 45:27.976
- Orange juice or something?
- No, thanks.

45:29.644 --> 45:32.862
Have you forgotten about Baz,
have you?

45:32.897 --> 45:35.269
Who's been looking after you?
Who's been giving you money?

45:36.818 --> 45:39.925
Huh? Me and Baz have.
That's who.

45:39.960 --> 45:42.998
And what does Craig give you?

45:43.033 --> 45:45.702
He's making a fortune.
How much does he give you?

45:45.737 --> 45:47.746
Craig bought me my flat.

45:47.781 --> 45:49.045
Nuh.

45:49.080 --> 45:51.381
Nuh. You don't own it.

45:51.416 --> 45:53.467
He just lets you live there.

45:53.502 --> 45:56.261
What is it you think
you've done for Baz?

45:56.296 --> 45:59.997
You think Baz gives two hoots
for what you've gone and done?

46:01.426 --> 46:02.851
Thanks, love.

46:02.886 --> 46:06.090
- Can we have the bill, please?
- Sure.

46:09.184 --> 46:10.595
He's dead.

46:12.855 --> 46:15.656
I know you care, honey.

46:15.691 --> 46:19.236
But don't you go thinking you care
in a special way like nobody else does.

46:19.271 --> 46:21.609
Craig's here.

46:24.450 --> 46:25.565
Hey.

46:31.082 --> 46:33.960
Maybe you should start
taking your pills again.

46:51.311 --> 46:53.820
What the fuck? Hey?

46:53.855 --> 46:55.607
What were they doing there so quick?

46:55.642 --> 46:57.897
They know who Baz's friends are.

46:57.932 --> 47:00.118
- Fuck!
- Keep your voice down.

47:00.153 --> 47:02.193
Mate, if they knew something,
we'd still be in there.

47:03.699 --> 47:05.916
They want to talk to you too, hon.

47:05.951 --> 47:08.287
You should call Ezra
and take yourself in tomorrow.

47:08.322 --> 47:10.921
I'm not going in there.
Are you fucking nuts?

47:10.956 --> 47:13.876
If you don't, they'll think
you've got something to hide.

47:13.911 --> 47:16.176
I fucking do!
I'm not going in there.

47:16.211 --> 47:18.589
They'll come looking for you
if you don't, sweetheart.

47:18.624 --> 47:20.306
Calm down.

47:20.341 --> 47:22.057
Fuck.

47:22.092 --> 47:23.635
Where's J?

47:28.808 --> 47:30.608
Where is J?

47:30.643 --> 47:33.271
- Is he still in there?
- I don't know.

47:33.306 --> 47:35.404
What's he saying?

47:35.439 --> 47:37.448
I don't know, OK?
Calm down, Craig.

47:37.483 --> 47:39.444
If he's not talking,
what are they still talking about?

47:39.479 --> 47:41.320
- Where is he?
- How the fuck should I know?

47:41.355 --> 47:43.698
Like I'm supposed to know where he is.

47:43.733 --> 47:45.358
Oh, fuck.

47:46.993 --> 47:48.736
Um, could I help?

47:49.954 --> 47:53.333
Yeah, you could get the, um,
knives and forks.

47:58.838 --> 48:00.878
So how was your day today?

48:02.676 --> 48:04.134
It was OK.

48:12.519 --> 48:14.229
How was yours?

48:14.264 --> 48:15.831
It was good.

48:15.866 --> 48:17.398
Dinner's ready.

48:19.735 --> 48:21.070
You can take those.

48:28.035 --> 48:31.700
How was your friend's... funeral?

48:34.667 --> 48:36.669
It was OK, you know.

48:36.704 --> 48:38.636
Sad and everything.

48:38.671 --> 48:41.506
Yeah. We saw it on the news.

48:48.890 --> 48:50.467
Hey, buddy. Mwah!

48:52.018 --> 48:53.895
Where have you been, Nicole?

48:53.930 --> 48:55.403
Detention. I told you.

48:55.438 --> 48:56.988
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

48:57.023 --> 48:59.734
- You had to sign that form.
- I signed the form.

48:59.769 --> 49:02.410
Oh, yeah.

49:02.445 --> 49:05.205
Well, then, get angry at him
for not telling you.

49:05.240 --> 49:08.243
I can't be having to tell you
everything all the time...

49:20.047 --> 49:24.301
J. Are you in there?

49:24.336 --> 49:25.768
Yep.

49:25.803 --> 49:27.345
Your uncle's at the door.

49:29.640 --> 49:31.383
I'm coming.

49:36.647 --> 49:38.438
What'd you let me fall asleep for?

49:39.775 --> 49:41.986
Mmm, I fell asleep.

49:42.021 --> 49:43.694
Yeah.

49:48.242 --> 49:50.161
Hey, um, we gotta go.

49:50.196 --> 49:51.359
Alright.

49:53.206 --> 49:54.700
It was nice to meet you.

49:56.542 --> 49:58.120
- See you.
- Hey, Daz.

50:03.758 --> 50:05.718
I do a lot for you, Nick.

50:05.753 --> 50:07.644
You're still at school

50:07.679 --> 50:09.556
and you're allowed to have
your boyfriend sleep over.

50:09.591 --> 50:12.925
That's a... big thing for me.

50:42.506 --> 50:43.973
Where are we going?

50:44.008 --> 50:46.093
To see our lawyer.

50:54.435 --> 50:56.499
This is really fucking important, mate.

50:56.534 --> 50:58.529
I need to know word for word.
You know?

50:58.564 --> 51:00.608
They just kept asking me
a couple of questions.

51:00.643 --> 51:02.617
I said, "I don't know,"
and then they let me go.

51:02.652 --> 51:04.702
Well, what were you doing
in there so long?

51:04.737 --> 51:08.324
Nothing. They just sat me in there
with no-one coming in or anything.

51:08.359 --> 51:09.999
That's good. That's OK.

51:10.034 --> 51:13.955
Now, I want you to listen
very carefully.

51:13.990 --> 51:17.876
From now on, mate,
you don't say anything,

51:17.911 --> 51:19.509
and that means nothing at all.

51:19.544 --> 51:23.715
You don't say, "I don't know."
You don't say, "I was sleeping."

51:23.750 --> 51:26.843
You just refuse to answer
any of their questions, OK?

51:26.878 --> 51:29.763
By law, these cunts
can't make you say anything.

51:29.798 --> 51:32.599
You don't even
have to give your name, OK?

51:32.634 --> 51:34.431
Now, this is very important.

51:34.466 --> 51:36.202
Don't let them push you around.

51:36.237 --> 51:37.903
You just sit there in silence,

51:37.938 --> 51:40.030
at least, you know, till I get there.

51:40.065 --> 51:43.235
This goes for you with your
girlfriend too. What's her name?

51:43.270 --> 51:45.166
- Nicole.
- Cole?

51:45.201 --> 51:47.062
- Nicole.
- Nicole.

51:48.949 --> 51:50.993
This goes for you with Nicole too.

51:51.028 --> 51:52.543
Now, there's certain things

51:52.578 --> 51:55.456
you just don't... you don't talk
to girls about, you know?

51:55.491 --> 51:57.750
It doesn't matter how special they are

51:57.785 --> 52:00.544
or what you have and haven't done.

52:00.579 --> 52:02.887
Girls, they get frightened.

52:02.922 --> 52:05.967
They... they natter.
They can't help it.

52:06.002 --> 52:07.591
It's just the way the world is.

52:09.137 --> 52:11.723
There's not really much
to understand about this

52:11.758 --> 52:13.940
except...

52:13.975 --> 52:15.599
you shut up.

52:17.520 --> 52:19.098
Are you clear with all that, honey?

52:20.440 --> 52:21.781
Yep.

52:21.816 --> 52:23.797
There's nothing to worry about.

52:23.832 --> 52:25.744
Hey, do you want a cold drink?

52:25.779 --> 52:28.114
I've got lots of different
kinds of drinks.

53:35.308 --> 53:37.683
Hey, mate.
Um, just that petrol.

53:37.718 --> 53:40.058
Number two, mate? $44.50.

53:41.940 --> 53:43.150
Ta.

53:52.242 --> 53:53.902
- Thanks, mate.
- Thanks.

54:10.886 --> 54:12.131
Fuckin' monster!

54:13.681 --> 54:15.731
- It's a nice gun, Rich.
- Yeah.

54:15.766 --> 54:17.310
- Can we go hunting?
- Yeah, maybe, mate.

54:17.345 --> 54:18.943
I've got a few things I gotta do.

54:18.978 --> 54:20.980
Look, can you just not blow holes
in me silo?

54:21.015 --> 54:23.934
It's fucked. It's written off.

54:27.653 --> 54:29.822
So how long were you
wanting to stay?

54:29.857 --> 54:31.998
And where's Kelly?

54:32.033 --> 54:34.452
We split up, mate.
Ages ago.

54:34.487 --> 54:36.445
Don't worry.

54:37.497 --> 54:40.041
You know, it's mutual
and everything, so...

54:40.076 --> 54:41.626
It's for the best.

54:46.965 --> 54:49.009
Fuckin' piece of shit!

54:49.044 --> 54:51.059
You OK, mate?

54:51.094 --> 54:52.838
What's with the scanner?

54:54.890 --> 54:57.726
I'll fight through, mate.
You know?

54:57.761 --> 54:59.860
I'll fight through.

54:59.895 --> 55:02.439
Look, um, I'm just thinking
it's only fair

55:02.474 --> 55:04.938
if you're gonna be hanging
here for a while,

55:04.973 --> 55:07.403
it's only fair you tell us
what this is about.

55:07.438 --> 55:08.869
Is that fair?

55:08.904 --> 55:11.395
I don't know what's going on, Rich.

55:13.117 --> 55:14.660
I don't know what's going on, mate.

55:27.381 --> 55:29.467
- Can you hear that?
- Hear what?

55:34.847 --> 55:36.639
I can hear your fuckin' dogs.

55:45.817 --> 55:47.283
What's going on?

55:47.318 --> 55:49.327
I don't know. I don't know.

55:49.362 --> 55:51.413
Tell him he can't stay here.

55:51.448 --> 55:53.825
I can't tell him nothin', love. Just...

55:53.860 --> 55:56.877
Cunt motherfuckers!

55:56.912 --> 55:58.420
What's that, Rich?
What's that?

55:58.455 --> 56:00.540
- I don't know. What is it, mate?
- It's a bug!

56:00.575 --> 56:02.417
There's a fucking bug on your house.

56:02.452 --> 56:03.425
I don't know about it.

56:03.460 --> 56:05.260
How can there be a bug on your house

56:05.295 --> 56:07.297
24 hours after I told you
I'm coming, huh?

56:07.332 --> 56:09.299
They're probably bugging
your phone, mate.

56:09.334 --> 56:11.007
I don't know.
I'm not lying to you.

56:14.346 --> 56:15.342
Fuck.

56:16.640 --> 56:18.148
What am I gonna do now, mate?

56:18.183 --> 56:20.639
I don't know, mate.
Maybe it's just best you leave, eh?

56:21.812 --> 56:24.054
Yeah. OK. Alright.

56:25.232 --> 56:27.735
Yeah, I gotta go, OK?

56:27.770 --> 56:29.194
I'll go.

56:32.031 --> 56:33.623
I'll go, yeah?

56:33.658 --> 56:35.282
- You'll be alright, mate.
- Yeah.

56:36.911 --> 56:38.785
Did I bring anything else?

57:05.732 --> 57:07.226
Shit.

58:05.008 --> 58:06.475
What did you tell her?

58:06.510 --> 58:08.804
I said you might be there
or you might not.

58:08.839 --> 58:10.761
That's the way. Spin it round.

58:16.061 --> 58:20.274
Well, I reckon there's more chance
of me not being there at the moment.

58:20.309 --> 58:22.068
Oh, well, she'll get over it.

58:26.072 --> 58:28.111
- Is it up there somewhere?
- Yeah.

58:31.536 --> 58:33.044
Good day, mate.

58:33.079 --> 58:34.705
<i>Craig Cody's gone, mate.</i>

58:34.740 --> 58:36.433
Oh, what do you mean?

58:36.468 --> 58:38.091
<i>We've had to drop him.</i>

58:38.126 --> 58:40.218
<i>He found the listening device
in Bendigo.</i>

58:40.253 --> 58:42.714
<i>He sounded unhinged
so they went in to apprehend him.</i>

58:42.749 --> 58:45.598
<i>He lost the plot.
Had to drop him.</i>

58:45.633 --> 58:48.094
Why didn't anyone call me?
I would've got the soggies up there.

58:48.129 --> 58:51.131
<i>There was no time for that, mate.
He just lost the plot.</i>

58:52.807 --> 58:54.432
Alright, give me a sec to think.

59:07.864 --> 59:10.700
I'm having trouble trying to find
my positive spin.

59:13.370 --> 59:15.446
I'm usually very good at it.

59:16.749 --> 59:19.666
Usually it's right there
and I can just have it.

59:24.131 --> 59:27.009
But I'm having trouble finding it now.

59:28.969 --> 59:30.436
I don't know why.

59:30.471 --> 59:34.765
People just don't listen, do they?

59:36.769 --> 59:38.980
You know, if you hadn't
have got in his ear, Mum,

59:39.015 --> 59:40.905
about turning himself in,

59:40.940 --> 59:43.645
there'd be none of this shit,
none of this carry-on.

59:46.237 --> 59:50.366
Did you think about that?
Did you?

59:50.401 --> 59:52.110
Fuckin' gone and spooked him.

59:52.145 --> 59:53.820
Now look what's fuckin' happened.

01:00:03.046 --> 01:00:05.173
Stop hitting me!
I didn't kill him.

01:00:05.208 --> 01:00:07.224
I thought that's what we did.

01:00:07.259 --> 01:00:09.469
We take it out on whoever turns up.

01:00:09.504 --> 01:00:11.478
Don't, alright?

01:00:11.513 --> 01:00:14.641
- Leave her alone.
- I'm alright, J.

01:00:14.676 --> 01:00:16.598
Just... just relax.

01:00:17.978 --> 01:00:20.856
- Come here, mate.
- Don't you touch him.

01:00:20.891 --> 01:00:24.106
- Come here.
- Relax.

01:00:25.152 --> 01:00:27.690
- Come here, you little...
- Don't you touch him!

01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:37.039
Good day, Josh.
I've got some bad news, mate.

01:00:37.074 --> 01:00:38.831
Yeah, he knows the bad news.

01:00:40.584 --> 01:00:42.398
Is everything OK here?

01:00:42.433 --> 01:00:44.213
Yeah. Everything's great.

01:00:44.248 --> 01:00:46.248
You alright, mate?

01:00:46.283 --> 01:00:48.249
He's fine, Mr Leckie.

01:00:51.137 --> 01:00:54.390
Josh, I'd like you to come down to
St Kilda Road with me, if that's OK.

01:00:54.425 --> 01:00:59.312
Hey, what's he done? Tell me.
I'll make sure he gets disciplined.

01:00:59.347 --> 01:01:00.778
Will you come with me, Josh?

01:01:00.813 --> 01:01:03.274
What do you want to talk to him about?
Talk to me about it.

01:01:03.309 --> 01:01:05.735
We'll speak to you again
at a later time when we're ready.

01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:09.656
I might, um... might have
some information for you

01:01:09.691 --> 01:01:11.649
about those two murdered police.

01:01:13.618 --> 01:01:15.168
I've been asking around a bit

01:01:15.203 --> 01:01:17.170
and there's a few theories
floating around

01:01:17.205 --> 01:01:19.589
but I don't know
if any of them are true or not

01:01:19.624 --> 01:01:22.329
but might be able to help you
with your investigations.

01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:26.138
Oh, thanks for that.

01:01:26.173 --> 01:01:28.467
Will you come with me, Josh?

01:01:28.502 --> 01:01:30.486
You go, love.

01:01:30.521 --> 01:01:32.436
I'll call Ezra.

01:01:32.471 --> 01:01:34.096
Go put your shoes on.

01:01:43.566 --> 01:01:46.694
I'm not currently in a position
to discuss what happened today

01:01:46.729 --> 01:01:49.322
but I can arrange for
counselling services to visit,

01:01:49.357 --> 01:01:51.314
should you require any.

01:01:54.118 --> 01:01:56.075
Hope you find the killers.

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:00.706
Yeah, so do I.

01:02:04.712 --> 01:02:06.420
You know you're not alone, right?

01:02:13.972 --> 01:02:15.964
We'll get you through this, mate.

01:02:18.351 --> 01:02:19.347
OK?

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:25.741
<i>This is a record of interview between</i>

01:02:25.776 --> 01:02:29.773
Detective Senior Sergeant Nathan
Leckie and Joshua Daniel Cody.

01:02:31.406 --> 01:02:33.721
Present is solicitor Ezra White.

01:02:33.756 --> 01:02:36.001
Now, I'll remind you again, Josh.

01:02:36.036 --> 01:02:38.455
You're under no obligation
to say anything at this point in time

01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:40.541
but anything you do say
can be used as evidence

01:02:40.576 --> 01:02:42.049
in any future court appearances.

01:02:42.084 --> 01:02:44.295
- You understand that?
- Yes, he understands that.

01:02:44.330 --> 01:02:46.371
OK.

01:02:47.464 --> 01:02:51.719
OK, now, picking up where we left off
when we last spoke,

01:02:51.754 --> 01:02:55.348
you were telling us
how upset your uncles were

01:02:55.383 --> 01:02:56.856
over the death of Barry Brown.

01:02:56.891 --> 01:03:01.729
Can you remember what was said
or any... any comments that were made

01:03:01.764 --> 01:03:03.852
at that time exactly?

01:03:11.781 --> 01:03:14.541
Josh, has Mr White
provided you with advice

01:03:14.576 --> 01:03:17.078
in respect to how you should conduct yourself
in this interview today?

01:03:17.113 --> 01:03:19.087
Yes, he'll be remaining mute.

01:03:19.122 --> 01:03:23.293
OK, I can appreciate you've been advised
not to say anything to me,

01:03:23.328 --> 01:03:25.427
but the sooner you help us
with our inquiries,

01:03:25.462 --> 01:03:28.548
the sooner we can scratch you off
the list and move onto a different line.

01:03:28.583 --> 01:03:30.090
You do understand that, don't you?

01:03:32.928 --> 01:03:35.501
Nothing else you want to say
at this point?

01:03:46.275 --> 01:03:48.610
There wasn't a good feeling in the room.

01:03:48.645 --> 01:03:50.744
Leckie was running the whole

01:03:50.779 --> 01:03:52.448
"Yesterday you were very helpful" routine.

01:03:52.483 --> 01:03:53.991
That was probably for my benefit.

01:03:54.026 --> 01:03:56.000
But I don't know.

01:03:56.035 --> 01:03:58.871
Look, he's just a kid.
Kids are stupid, they're weak.

01:03:58.906 --> 01:04:00.588
He may think he's doing
the right thing

01:04:00.623 --> 01:04:02.833
but really, you know,
his foot's covered in dog shit

01:04:02.868 --> 01:04:04.967
and he's got it stuck
right in his mouth.

01:04:05.002 --> 01:04:08.881
I'm pretty surprised you let him get
anywhere near to you, to be honest.

01:04:08.916 --> 01:04:11.609
- I told you to go get that car.
- No, you didn't.

01:04:11.644 --> 01:04:13.954
- I told you to go get the car.
- No, you didn't!

01:04:13.989 --> 01:04:16.264
You never fuckin' mentioned it
to me once, Pope!

01:04:16.299 --> 01:04:17.772
I don't want to hear this.

01:04:17.807 --> 01:04:20.205
You've just gotta be worried
about what he's doing.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.318
He's a big kid.
He can look after himself.

01:04:22.353 --> 01:04:24.146
Can he, now?
Can he handle police?

01:04:24.181 --> 01:04:25.940
It's a totally different
kettle of fish.

01:04:25.975 --> 01:04:27.407
What should we do?

01:04:27.442 --> 01:04:30.153
I'd start by keeping an eagle eye
on him, that's for sure.

01:04:30.188 --> 01:04:31.620
Where is he now?

01:04:31.655 --> 01:04:33.490
He's in his room with his girlfriend.

01:04:33.525 --> 01:04:35.874
Is he?
What's she doing here?

01:04:35.909 --> 01:04:38.752
Really?

01:04:38.787 --> 01:04:40.744
Yeah, well, we'll do it anyway.

01:04:42.582 --> 01:04:44.041
Yeah, cool.

01:04:45.752 --> 01:04:47.412
OK. Well, call me back.

01:04:55.512 --> 01:04:57.062
Is he talking to her?

01:04:57.097 --> 01:04:58.647
How should I know?

01:04:58.682 --> 01:05:01.525
Mate, I can't help you
with the how part.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.896
You've just gotta be looking out
for this shit, you know?

01:05:03.931 --> 01:05:06.315
What? So he's my responsibility now?

01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:08.984
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:05:16.784 --> 01:05:18.409
This is bullshit.

01:05:20.413 --> 01:05:22.665
Well, you know I'm not
fucking telling them anything.

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:24.751
Mate, the cops are serious
about this thing, J.

01:05:24.786 --> 01:05:26.926
And they're onto you like a rash.

01:05:26.961 --> 01:05:29.401
So if you just stick close by,
everyone will keep calm.

01:05:29.436 --> 01:05:31.841
- What am I supposed to do?
- How the fuck should I know?

01:05:31.876 --> 01:05:33.676
Go in your room
and do some colouring in.

01:05:33.711 --> 01:05:35.310
I've gotta go get him. Yeah.

01:05:35.345 --> 01:05:39.129
- Hey, J, Danielle wants to...
- Can you give us a minute here?

01:05:40.183 --> 01:05:42.727
- Why? What's going on?
- Don't be a stickybeak. Just...

01:05:42.762 --> 01:05:44.813
Danielle just wants
to talk to you for a sec.

01:05:44.848 --> 01:05:46.604
I'll talk to her in a minute.

01:05:49.776 --> 01:05:53.644
Look, mate, I don't know if you
want to hear this or not but...

01:05:55.157 --> 01:05:57.165
I would think pretty hard
about giving her the flick.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:00.037
- I don't know what you have or...
- Haven't been telling her anything.

01:06:00.072 --> 01:06:02.873
Life will be easier
if you just cut her loose, J.

01:06:02.908 --> 01:06:04.631
Believe me.

01:06:04.666 --> 01:06:07.294
She shouldn't be hanging
around here right now.

01:06:07.329 --> 01:06:09.470
This has got nothing to do with me.

01:06:09.505 --> 01:06:12.633
Mate, everything has
got to do with everyone.

01:06:12.668 --> 01:06:15.052
Don't you fucking understand that?

01:06:15.087 --> 01:06:17.555
Do you understand that, J?

01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:19.140
- J, do--
- Yes!

01:06:19.175 --> 01:06:20.682
Thank you.

01:06:24.103 --> 01:06:27.001
Maybe it's just for a little while.

01:06:27.036 --> 01:06:29.899
I just need some space and that.

01:06:31.444 --> 01:06:32.910
For what?

01:06:32.945 --> 01:06:35.615
Just some things I gotta do.

01:06:41.788 --> 01:06:43.615
Do you love me?

01:06:50.964 --> 01:06:53.336
Do you love me?

01:06:56.678 --> 01:06:58.635
Yeah.

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:01.848
Why?

01:07:07.439 --> 01:07:08.933
'Cause you're nice.

01:07:15.906 --> 01:07:18.492
Please don't get upset, Nicky.

01:07:20.035 --> 01:07:21.585
Good day, Josh.

01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:23.768
Oh, what the fuck...

01:07:23.803 --> 01:07:25.916
We need to talk, mate.

01:07:25.951 --> 01:07:27.425
No, we don't.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.462
- Are you alright?
- She's fine.

01:07:29.497 --> 01:07:31.387
Am I, fuckwit?

01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:33.174
Oh, come on,
where are you going, Nicky?

01:07:33.209 --> 01:07:34.807
Can you just go away?

01:07:34.842 --> 01:07:36.601
We can either talk in here or outside.

01:07:36.636 --> 01:07:39.555
- There's nothing to talk about.
- I will arrest you if I have to.

01:07:39.590 --> 01:07:41.849
- What for?
- Under-age drinking.

01:07:41.884 --> 01:07:43.723
Oh, give me a fuckin' break.

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:47.473
You want me to make a scene?

01:09:04.059 --> 01:09:06.776
- Hey.
- Is J here?

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:10.113
No, J, he's...
he's gone down to the shops.

01:09:10.148 --> 01:09:14.027
But, um, come in. Come and wait for him
if you want. He won't be long.

01:09:21.577 --> 01:09:23.071
Have a seat.

01:09:25.913 --> 01:09:28.435
Did he say how long he'd be?

01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:30.957
Uh... no, he won't be long.

01:09:32.129 --> 01:09:34.381
Where you been tonight?

01:09:34.416 --> 01:09:36.634
Just down at the Zanoni.

01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:38.337
Zanoni, huh?

01:09:38.372 --> 01:09:40.005
Oh, yeah.

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.721
Anyone there you know?

01:09:45.756 --> 01:09:47.804
Talk to anyone you know?

01:09:49.313 --> 01:09:51.140
There was nobody there that I know.

01:10:00.658 --> 01:10:04.913
Oh, well, I was about to
have a shot but, uh...

01:10:04.948 --> 01:10:06.537
You want some?

01:10:09.167 --> 01:10:10.626
What is it?

01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:14.346
Oh, it's fun.

01:10:14.381 --> 01:10:16.841
No, she's just going home.

01:10:16.876 --> 01:10:18.548
It's fun.

01:10:18.583 --> 01:10:20.185
Have some.

01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:22.555
Go ahead. Come on.

01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:24.891
Put your arm out.

01:10:24.926 --> 01:10:26.942
Come on.

01:10:26.977 --> 01:10:29.385
There you go. That's it.

01:10:31.273 --> 01:10:34.193
Now, there we go.

01:10:34.228 --> 01:10:35.984
There we go.

01:10:44.161 --> 01:10:46.533
There we go.

01:10:58.467 --> 01:11:00.211
You been talking to the cops?

01:11:02.597 --> 01:11:04.939
What?

01:11:04.974 --> 01:11:06.826
About what?

01:11:06.861 --> 01:11:08.678
About anything.

01:11:11.523 --> 01:11:14.449
Nuh. It's none of my business.

01:11:14.484 --> 01:11:16.820
Yeah, yeah, it's your business,
isn't it?

01:11:16.855 --> 01:11:18.953
When you're in love with someone

01:11:18.988 --> 01:11:22.117
and you're whispering
sweet nothings in their ears.

01:11:22.152 --> 01:11:24.240
Hey? Look at me. Look at me.

01:11:27.664 --> 01:11:29.548
I got a call from someone

01:11:29.583 --> 01:11:33.166
who told me that you've been
talking to the cops.

01:11:37.257 --> 01:11:39.016
What cops?

01:11:39.051 --> 01:11:41.929
Oh, down at Zanoni's.

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:43.506
You can tell me.

01:11:46.141 --> 01:11:49.142
You been talking to the cops?

01:11:50.396 --> 01:11:51.821
Come here.

01:11:51.856 --> 01:11:54.031
Come here, baby.

01:11:54.066 --> 01:11:55.574
Fuck. Pope.

01:11:55.609 --> 01:11:58.111
Pope, what the fuck you doing?

01:11:58.146 --> 01:12:00.614
What the fuck you doing, Pope?

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:02.613
Pope, what are you doing?

01:12:02.648 --> 01:12:07.211
Pope!

01:12:07.246 --> 01:12:08.906
Pope, what are you doing?

01:12:10.875 --> 01:12:13.628
Please, Pope, stop it, please.

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:15.505
Andrew, please.

01:12:18.508 --> 01:12:21.213
Oh, fuck, Pope, what are you doing?

01:12:24.639 --> 01:12:26.181
Shit, man.

01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:32.770
What the fuck?

01:12:34.816 --> 01:12:36.818
You've gone and done it again,
haven't you, Darren?

01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:38.900
You've smoked yourself silly.

01:12:38.935 --> 01:12:40.947
You think something's going on.

01:13:02.803 --> 01:13:05.055
Why'd you bring me here?

01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:06.716
For your safety.

01:14:18.923 --> 01:14:20.583
You want a sip of my drink?

01:14:28.433 --> 01:14:30.342
What's the matter?

01:14:34.522 --> 01:14:36.064
Are you scared?

01:14:41.404 --> 01:14:43.313
Scared of me?

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:55.374
That can't feel too fuckin' good.

01:15:01.341 --> 01:15:02.966
Bananas.

01:15:19.735 --> 01:15:22.060
Let's go sit outside for a bit, eh?

01:15:24.198 --> 01:15:25.858
Just you and me.

01:15:35.752 --> 01:15:37.329
You know what the bush is about?

01:15:39.756 --> 01:15:41.180
It's about massive trees

01:15:41.215 --> 01:15:43.983
that've been standing there
for thousands of years

01:15:44.018 --> 01:15:46.752
and bugs that'll be dead
before the minute's out.

01:15:48.807 --> 01:15:50.680
It's big trees and pissy little bugs.

01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:56.961
And everything knows its place
in the scheme of things.

01:15:56.996 --> 01:16:00.652
Everything... everything sits
in the order somewhere.

01:16:00.687 --> 01:16:02.369
Things survive because they're strong

01:16:02.404 --> 01:16:05.690
and... everything reaches
an understanding.

01:16:10.704 --> 01:16:13.332
But not everything survives
because it's strong.

01:16:13.367 --> 01:16:14.840
Some creatures are weak,

01:16:14.875 --> 01:16:18.629
but they survive because they've
been protected by the strong,

01:16:18.664 --> 01:16:20.088
for one reason or another.

01:16:22.967 --> 01:16:26.595
You may think that because of the circles
that you move in or whatever

01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:29.511
that you're one of
the strong creatures.

01:16:29.546 --> 01:16:32.358
But you're not.
You're one of the weak ones.

01:16:32.393 --> 01:16:36.270
That's nothing against you.
You're just weak because you're young.

01:16:36.305 --> 01:16:40.147
But you've survived because
you've been protected by the strong.

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:43.814
But they're not strong anymore.

01:16:45.073 --> 01:16:47.398
And they're certainly not able
to protect you.

01:16:51.996 --> 01:16:54.784
We're here because we know who you are
and we know what you've done.

01:16:57.043 --> 01:16:59.617
Now, I know you feel like
you're in a tough situation.

01:17:01.256 --> 01:17:03.098
But you have an out.

01:17:03.133 --> 01:17:06.803
There's nothing your uncles can do
to squirm out of this one.

01:17:06.838 --> 01:17:09.187
Craig's learnt that the hard way.

01:17:09.222 --> 01:17:11.266
But you're not like that.
We can see that.

01:17:11.301 --> 01:17:12.974
And you know that.

01:17:15.854 --> 01:17:17.446
Now, I know they're saying to you

01:17:17.481 --> 01:17:20.351
that talking to me
is betraying the family.

01:17:22.152 --> 01:17:24.244
But they've betrayed you.

01:17:24.279 --> 01:17:25.829
The fact that you're talking to me,

01:17:25.864 --> 01:17:29.696
the fact that you've been
left to deal with us...

01:17:30.869 --> 01:17:32.696
is all the proof that you need.

01:17:34.915 --> 01:17:36.623
And you're in danger.

01:17:38.085 --> 01:17:39.579
Don't be confused about that.

01:17:44.175 --> 01:17:45.752
I think you know.

01:17:47.345 --> 01:17:50.271
And I think you know
that I can help you.

01:17:50.306 --> 01:17:52.548
But I can't keep offering.
You've got to decide.

01:17:56.145 --> 01:17:57.937
You've got to work out where you fit.

01:18:06.281 --> 01:18:09.235
I don't know why
you're telling me all of this.

01:18:10.785 --> 01:18:12.244
Yes, you do.

01:18:25.801 --> 01:18:28.095
OK, we're going home.

01:18:36.145 --> 01:18:37.805
Justin, we're leaving, mate.

01:18:53.496 --> 01:18:55.998
You know, you can say
what you like about Craig,

01:18:56.033 --> 01:18:58.157
but at least he was clean.

01:19:02.255 --> 01:19:04.546
Hi, sweetie. Where you been?

01:19:04.581 --> 01:19:06.837
Uh, just at Nicky's house.

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:10.743
Oh, yeah?

01:19:10.778 --> 01:19:12.708
How is she?

01:19:12.743 --> 01:19:14.639
Yeah, she's OK.

01:19:23.944 --> 01:19:27.147
Hey. Yeah, it's me.

01:19:28.699 --> 01:19:31.154
He's here.
He's just walked in.

01:19:34.997 --> 01:19:37.369
Fuck. Calm down, Darren.

01:20:35.517 --> 01:20:37.018
What's wrong, hon?

01:20:37.053 --> 01:20:38.485
My fuckin' car keys.

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:40.522
Where the fuck are my car keys?

01:20:42.024 --> 01:20:44.401
Give us yours, mate.
I'm going to take your car.

01:20:44.436 --> 01:20:46.545
What's that girl's... Where...
That girl...

01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:48.431
You know the girl--
what's her address?

01:20:48.466 --> 01:20:50.247
- The fuck...
- What's wrong?

01:20:50.282 --> 01:20:51.700
Just tell me what's her fuckin' address?

01:20:51.735 --> 01:20:53.386
You went there the other day, mate.

01:20:53.421 --> 01:20:55.002
Yeah, and I fuckin' forgot, didn't I?

01:20:55.037 --> 01:20:56.831
Just tell me,
what's her fuckin' address?

01:21:07.133 --> 01:21:08.599
Sorry.

01:21:08.634 --> 01:21:10.548
Nicky's not here, J.

01:21:10.583 --> 01:21:12.462
Is everything alright?

01:21:14.432 --> 01:21:15.940
Yeah.

01:21:15.975 --> 01:21:18.067
Was she with you last night?

01:21:18.102 --> 01:21:20.854
Yeah, I think she went to stay
at Danielle's place.

01:21:22.857 --> 01:21:25.568
I'm just gonna use the toilet,
if that's OK.

01:21:25.603 --> 01:21:27.312
Yeah, sure. Fine.

01:22:30.593 --> 01:22:32.268
<i>- Darren?
- J, you've got to get out.</i>

01:22:32.303 --> 01:22:35.014
<i>Pope just left here in a bad way
and he's heading over there.</i>

01:22:35.049 --> 01:22:37.232
Well, how does he know where I am?

01:22:37.267 --> 01:22:39.936
<i>I don't know. Just get out, alright, man?
You've gotta get out, alright?</i>

01:22:39.971 --> 01:22:41.646
<i>Just go, OK?</i>

01:22:41.681 --> 01:22:43.369
<i>OK?</i>

01:22:43.404 --> 01:22:45.057
OK.

01:22:58.330 --> 01:23:01.625
Hey, Gus, um, would you be able to
give me a lift somewhere, please?

01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:04.343
Mate, I've got a shitload of work
to do here. I'm sorry, mate.

01:23:04.378 --> 01:23:08.079
It's just that I'm a bit late
and it's down near the shops and that.

01:23:10.801 --> 01:23:12.794
Alright, just give us a moment.

01:23:17.349 --> 01:23:19.093
You're gonna have to turn that off, buddy.

01:23:21.228 --> 01:23:22.687
Yep, we're gonna go for a ride.

01:23:25.066 --> 01:23:26.609
Here, whack that on.

01:26:51.944 --> 01:26:53.578
OK, this is the stuff.

01:26:53.613 --> 01:26:55.865
This Vietnamese place
in Russell Street makes this.

01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:58.009
Real chilli sauce.
Smell that.

01:26:58.044 --> 01:27:00.084
Don't suck it in.

01:27:00.119 --> 01:27:02.159
Right, half a teaspoon of that, OK?

01:27:04.374 --> 01:27:05.840
Keep the noodles on the stock

01:27:05.875 --> 01:27:07.814
for another minute or so
and then pull them off.

01:27:07.849 --> 01:27:09.719
Or just taste them.
You'll know when they're ready.

01:27:09.754 --> 01:27:12.299
Then chuck the rest of the stuff in.
You should be right.

01:27:12.334 --> 01:27:13.842
Yep. Do I keep stirring?

01:27:13.877 --> 01:27:15.392
Yeah. Why not?

01:27:15.427 --> 01:27:18.511
- See you later.
- Yep. See ya.

01:27:33.487 --> 01:27:36.025
Ezra says don't get your hopes up
about the committal.

01:27:37.449 --> 01:27:39.291
But he said he...

01:27:39.326 --> 01:27:40.953
there were strings he could pull.

01:27:40.988 --> 01:27:43.073
They're all pulled.

01:27:43.108 --> 01:27:45.158
How you keeping, hon?

01:27:46.208 --> 01:27:49.628
Well, hold on, what did he say about
getting a bail application in?

01:27:49.663 --> 01:27:51.087
Is he on this thing or what?

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:54.612
Darren, honey.

01:27:54.647 --> 01:27:56.350
Say something.

01:27:56.385 --> 01:27:58.959
Speak to her.

01:28:00.681 --> 01:28:02.473
What's going on in here?

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:06.434
Will you speak to Mum,
you fuckin' sook?

01:28:10.275 --> 01:28:13.695
What'd Ez say about whomping
the bail application in?

01:28:13.730 --> 01:28:15.787
What do you think he said?

01:28:15.822 --> 01:28:19.124
It's been whomped.
You're not getting bail.

01:28:19.159 --> 01:28:21.494
What on earth made you think
you were gonna get bail?

01:28:21.529 --> 01:28:23.169
What do you think you're in here for?

01:28:23.204 --> 01:28:25.162
- Don't fuckin' start up again, Mum.
- Hey!

01:28:26.458 --> 01:28:29.586
If you let anything
happen to him in here...

01:28:29.621 --> 01:28:31.386
What?

01:28:31.421 --> 01:28:33.465
What are you gonna do?

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:34.640
Huh?

01:28:34.675 --> 01:28:36.176
What are you gonna do, Mum?

01:28:36.211 --> 01:28:37.858
Darren?

01:28:37.893 --> 01:28:39.506
Baby.

01:28:47.021 --> 01:28:48.764
Better do something.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.660
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:29:11.838 --> 01:29:14.757
We gotta do something about J.

01:29:14.792 --> 01:29:16.964
What do you mean?

01:29:18.052 --> 01:29:20.305
We gotta do something about J.

01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:22.105
He's got to go.

01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:23.440
He's in witness protection, Janine.

01:29:23.475 --> 01:29:25.551
You know what witness protection means.

01:29:28.396 --> 01:29:30.436
Here's the address
of where he's staying.

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:39.190
Get in the car.

01:29:55.799 --> 01:29:59.303
You really want to go down this path?
We're still working on this.

01:29:59.338 --> 01:30:01.046
Where did you get this?

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:04.300
I've been around a long time, sweetie.

01:30:05.935 --> 01:30:09.355
J's turned and he's not coming back.

01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:11.812
Even if the boys get off,

01:30:11.847 --> 01:30:14.200
I won't be seeing J again.

01:30:14.235 --> 01:30:17.438
And I don't want Darren
to rot in that jail.

01:30:19.449 --> 01:30:22.493
If my boys go down, that's it.

01:30:22.528 --> 01:30:24.036
I got no-one left.

01:30:26.497 --> 01:30:29.132
J's gone,

01:30:29.167 --> 01:30:31.134
whatever happens.

01:30:31.169 --> 01:30:33.956
We got to set up a meeting.
Is your office safe?

01:30:35.173 --> 01:30:37.766
Look, I know you got a problem, Janine.

01:30:37.801 --> 01:30:40.136
But I don't see how this mess
your boys are in

01:30:40.171 --> 01:30:41.761
has got anything to do with me.

01:30:42.806 --> 01:30:46.476
So if you've called me in here to see
if there's some strings I can pull,

01:30:46.511 --> 01:30:47.935
then you're way off course.

01:30:49.563 --> 01:30:51.271
Is that what this is about?

01:30:52.482 --> 01:30:56.743
Hey, Randall, before you go on,

01:30:56.778 --> 01:31:00.032
this boy who's currently
being looked after--

01:31:00.067 --> 01:31:01.540
tell me if you agree with this--

01:31:01.575 --> 01:31:06.321
this boy who's being looked after,
he knows who you are.

01:31:07.831 --> 01:31:09.298
And you know how these things go.

01:31:09.333 --> 01:31:11.481
They're gonna ask him
all sorts of questions

01:31:11.516 --> 01:31:13.629
about everything he's ever seen or done.

01:31:13.664 --> 01:31:15.272
Everyone he's ever met.

01:31:15.307 --> 01:31:16.881
The whole shemozzle.

01:31:18.259 --> 01:31:21.762
And you've done some bad things, sweetie.

01:31:21.797 --> 01:31:24.647
Haven't you?

01:31:24.682 --> 01:31:26.691
I want this part to be clear.

01:31:26.726 --> 01:31:29.027
This is not about you
doing me a favour

01:31:29.062 --> 01:31:33.942
or... me blackmailing you,
anything like that.

01:31:33.977 --> 01:31:37.737
It's just a bad situation for everyone.

01:31:37.772 --> 01:31:40.580
Ezra's got the address.

01:31:40.615 --> 01:31:43.708
It shouldn't be too hard
to set up a raid on the house.

01:31:43.743 --> 01:31:47.622
There'd be reasonable grounds,
what with all the strange activity,

01:31:47.657 --> 01:31:49.464
the comings and goings day and night.

01:31:49.499 --> 01:31:52.121
One of the neighbours might've seen
a gun or something.

01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:55.470
This is your area of expertise.

01:31:55.505 --> 01:31:58.175
I'm not trying to tell you
how to suck eggs.

01:31:59.384 --> 01:32:00.843
What do you think?

01:32:08.519 --> 01:32:12.303
I really don't see how
anything can be done, Janine.

01:32:13.857 --> 01:32:15.268
Randall...

01:32:17.403 --> 01:32:19.230
I feel sick about this.

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:22.970
I'm not happy at all,

01:32:23.005 --> 01:32:24.700
not one little bit.

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:29.957
But we do what we have to do.
We do what we must.

01:32:29.992 --> 01:32:31.793
Just because we don't
want to do something

01:32:31.828 --> 01:32:33.666
doesn't mean it can't be done.

01:32:57.819 --> 01:32:59.064
Hey!

01:33:06.995 --> 01:33:08.454
They're cops.

01:33:10.415 --> 01:33:12.251
Jesus Christ, what the fuck
are cops doing here?

01:33:12.286 --> 01:33:13.717
Who says they're cops?

01:33:13.752 --> 01:33:15.754
'Cause they're wearing fucking
flak jackets, it makes them cops?

01:33:15.789 --> 01:33:17.596
- Who else would it be?
- I don't fuckin' know.

01:33:17.631 --> 01:33:19.675
They're wearing flak jackets with
fuckin' "Police" written on them.

01:33:19.710 --> 01:33:22.248
- So what do we do?
- We surrender. There's six of them.

01:33:26.307 --> 01:33:28.559
- I'm not taking them head-on, mate.
- They're fuckin' cops!

01:33:28.594 --> 01:33:30.811
I don't care who they are, mate.
I'm not fighting a war.

01:33:30.846 --> 01:33:32.730
I'm not fighting a war
over some fuckwit kid!

01:33:32.765 --> 01:33:34.815
Fuck that!
I'll shoot him myself.

01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:36.449
What are we gonna do?

01:33:36.484 --> 01:33:39.817
I don't fuckin' know what we're gonna do.
What are you gonna do?

01:33:42.615 --> 01:33:44.367
That's it. I'm done.

01:33:44.402 --> 01:33:45.625
What?

01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:48.294
Oh... Fuck!

01:33:48.329 --> 01:33:49.963
Police! Open up!

01:33:49.998 --> 01:33:54.836
Open the fucking door! Open the door
or we'll bust it down.

01:33:54.871 --> 01:33:56.261
- We're witness protection.
- Fuck.

01:33:56.296 --> 01:33:58.388
Don't fuck around.
Open it now!

01:33:58.423 --> 01:34:00.133
- Alright. OK. OK.
- Oh, fuck.

01:34:03.303 --> 01:34:04.978
Shit.

01:34:05.013 --> 01:34:08.183
You'd think the executives
at that station,

01:34:08.218 --> 01:34:12.194
they need a new host for their show,

01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:15.023
they could find someone
with straighter teeth.

01:34:19.236 --> 01:34:21.379
I don't mind his personality

01:34:21.414 --> 01:34:23.523
but his mouth's so off-putting.

01:34:28.746 --> 01:34:30.379
Oh, my goodness.

01:34:30.414 --> 01:34:32.214
I need to talk to you.

01:34:32.249 --> 01:34:35.127
- What you doing here?
- Is there anyone inside?

01:34:35.162 --> 01:34:37.897
Just my neighbour Helen, love.

01:34:37.932 --> 01:34:40.633
I wanna get Pope out of jail.

01:34:40.668 --> 01:34:42.424
I can't live like this.

01:34:43.844 --> 01:34:45.339
Of course, dear.

01:34:52.395 --> 01:34:54.395
I want to set up a meeting with Ezra

01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:56.395
and that barrister from the committal.

01:34:57.442 --> 01:34:58.985
OK. Of course.

01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:00.493
I don't trust Ezra

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:02.153
so I'm not going to anyone's house.

01:35:03.698 --> 01:35:05.276
It has to be somewhere public.

01:35:06.576 --> 01:35:09.537
But it also has to be somewhere
no-one we know would go.

01:35:09.572 --> 01:35:11.945
OK, honey. OK.

01:35:13.083 --> 01:35:16.169
Mate, if you really
want to help the boys,

01:35:16.204 --> 01:35:17.886
coming home is the thing to do.

01:35:17.921 --> 01:35:19.798
I'm not coming home.
I'm not safe there.

01:35:19.833 --> 01:35:21.717
Yes, you are, dear.

01:35:21.752 --> 01:35:23.767
No, I'm not.

01:35:23.802 --> 01:35:25.512
I'm not safe in witness protection either,

01:35:25.547 --> 01:35:27.598
but I'd rather take my chances there.

01:35:27.633 --> 01:35:29.534
You'll be safe at home, honey.

01:35:29.569 --> 01:35:31.435
You can't promise me that.

01:35:31.470 --> 01:35:33.319
I can. I can.

01:35:33.354 --> 01:35:35.070
I'm not coming home.
I'm going back there.

01:35:35.105 --> 01:35:37.679
I'm just letting you all know
that I'm here to help.

01:35:42.530 --> 01:35:44.688
I think J's made his position clear.

01:35:47.576 --> 01:35:51.205
Where that leaves us now
is to decide how best to proceed,

01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:53.992
given the brave offer
of assistance he's made.

01:35:55.501 --> 01:35:58.963
You know, this thing's going to trial
with or without J, that's a given.

01:35:58.998 --> 01:36:01.205
What we want is to win it.

01:36:04.344 --> 01:36:06.477
You know what I liked
about the committal hearing?

01:36:06.512 --> 01:36:10.162
Despite the fact that we've been
ordered to stand trial, of course.

01:36:10.197 --> 01:36:13.812
But what I liked about the committal
was that for the most part,

01:36:13.847 --> 01:36:15.894
their case looked pretty flimsy to me.

01:36:15.929 --> 01:36:17.906
Largely dependent on witness testimony

01:36:17.941 --> 01:36:21.284
that shouldn't be too hard to discredit,
I wouldn't have thought.

01:36:21.319 --> 01:36:24.656
And if the committal's any indicator,
then J here's their star witness.

01:36:24.691 --> 01:36:28.535
Without him, they'll need
to strengthen their brief,

01:36:28.570 --> 01:36:30.991
which they will do
with something else.

01:36:32.122 --> 01:36:35.501
Personally, I'd rather tackle
the evidence I saw at the committal

01:36:35.536 --> 01:36:38.087
than any rejigged brief
they come up with

01:36:38.122 --> 01:36:40.589
should J suddenly decide to leave.

01:36:40.624 --> 01:36:42.222
You know what I mean?

01:36:42.257 --> 01:36:44.058
So I think we should
just get into it.

01:36:44.093 --> 01:36:46.381
There's a bunch of things
we'll need to go through...

01:37:08.451 --> 01:37:09.993
Come with me.

01:37:15.542 --> 01:37:18.093
- Where have you been?
- Hiding.

01:37:18.128 --> 01:37:20.171
You shouldn't have left the house.
Where did you go?

01:37:20.206 --> 01:37:21.972
I was hiding.

01:37:22.007 --> 01:37:24.140
It was the Drug Squad
who raided the house today.

01:37:24.175 --> 01:37:27.053
OK? They'd been told
something funny was going on here.

01:37:27.088 --> 01:37:28.854
It was just a fuckin' mix-up.

01:37:28.889 --> 01:37:31.141
Now, you're not in any danger, alright?

01:37:31.176 --> 01:37:32.684
I need you to understand that.

01:37:32.719 --> 01:37:34.735
- OK?
- OK.

01:37:34.770 --> 01:37:36.730
Did anybody see you out there today?

01:37:36.765 --> 01:37:38.728
No.

01:37:38.763 --> 01:37:40.657
OK.

01:37:40.692 --> 01:37:42.752
You alright?

01:37:42.787 --> 01:37:44.812
I'm fine.

01:38:04.133 --> 01:38:06.706
I think courtrooms make everyone
feel a little bit nervous.

01:38:15.603 --> 01:38:17.522
You ready?

01:38:26.072 --> 01:38:28.694
Coming down.

01:39:22.422 --> 01:39:26.718
<i>Your girlfriend, Nicole,
died from a heroin overdose.</i>

01:39:26.753 --> 01:39:29.435
- Is this true?
- Yes.

01:39:29.470 --> 01:39:33.558
And is it true you believe your uncles
were responsible for this?

01:39:33.593 --> 01:39:35.202
- Yes.
- How?

01:39:35.237 --> 01:39:36.776
They injected her.

01:39:36.811 --> 01:39:38.570
Maybe don't rush your answers.

01:39:38.605 --> 01:39:42.275
The more hesitant you are,
the more uncertain you'll appear, OK?

01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:45.410
How's he gonna remember all this?

01:39:45.445 --> 01:39:47.697
He doesn't need to.
It's better if he doesn't.

01:39:47.732 --> 01:39:49.247
We don't want him reciting lines.

01:39:49.282 --> 01:39:51.889
He just needs to get
into the swing of it,

01:39:51.924 --> 01:39:54.496
wrap his head around
the flavour of it.

01:39:54.531 --> 01:39:56.323
Do you understand that, J?

01:39:58.625 --> 01:40:00.586
So you're saying
they forcibly injected her

01:40:00.621 --> 01:40:02.671
with what's known as a "hot shot."

01:40:02.706 --> 01:40:04.221
Yes.

01:40:04.256 --> 01:40:06.961
- Did you see them do it?
- No.

01:40:08.010 --> 01:40:10.299
Was she known to you
to be a user of heroin?

01:40:11.805 --> 01:40:13.689
Sometimes, yeah.

01:40:13.724 --> 01:40:16.560
Was she?
This is me talking now.

01:40:16.595 --> 01:40:18.778
No.

01:40:18.813 --> 01:40:22.114
Then say no.
You don't need to lie.

01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:25.319
Was there any reason
why on this particular night

01:40:25.354 --> 01:40:27.238
she might have wanted to use heroin?

01:40:27.273 --> 01:40:28.732
Maybe.

01:40:30.074 --> 01:40:32.583
Why maybe?

01:40:32.618 --> 01:40:35.491
I broke up with her.

01:40:35.526 --> 01:40:38.365
- That night?
- Yeah.

01:40:40.752 --> 01:40:44.999
So to some extent you feel responsible
for Nicole's death.

01:40:46.591 --> 01:40:49.059
I don't know, maybe to an extent.

01:40:49.094 --> 01:40:51.221
But you want your uncles
put away for it,

01:40:51.256 --> 01:40:53.355
even though you didn't see them do it

01:40:53.390 --> 01:40:55.538
and she was justifiably upset
on this night

01:40:55.573 --> 01:40:57.686
because you had ended the relationship.

01:40:57.721 --> 01:40:59.236
You're looking for someone to blame

01:40:59.271 --> 01:41:00.904
for something you feel responsible for.

01:41:00.939 --> 01:41:04.024
Would you agree with that?
Blah, blah, blah.

01:41:08.113 --> 01:41:09.572
It's good.

01:41:14.119 --> 01:41:17.120
- You feel OK?
- You OK, sweetheart?

01:41:18.207 --> 01:41:20.876
Yeah, I'm fine. Can you go grab us
a drink or something?

01:41:20.911 --> 01:41:22.885
Of course.

01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:25.209
There must be a drink machine
around here somewhere.

01:43:02.230 --> 01:43:04.104
Have you worked out where you fit?

01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:38.149
<i>That's all due to this trauma.</i>

01:43:38.184 --> 01:43:41.062
<i>Now, my family's been dragged
through the mud over this.</i>

01:43:41.097 --> 01:43:43.738
<i>And that kind of action
plays heavy on your mind.</i>

01:43:43.773 --> 01:43:46.901
<i>You know, the police go off on a tangent,
fly off the handle,</i>

01:43:46.936 --> 01:43:50.328
<i>and... wee young kid like J
gets the idea</i>

01:43:50.363 --> 01:43:53.074
you can't even trust
the law to work properly.

01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:56.703
The justice system, yeah?

01:43:56.738 --> 01:43:58.628
Um, OK.

01:43:58.663 --> 01:44:00.880
Alright. Maybe that's enough of that.

01:44:00.915 --> 01:44:05.837
Uh, Andrew, I was hoping
to get some shots of you and Darren

01:44:05.872 --> 01:44:08.965
reacting to the news
of your acquittal on the TV.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.099
What?

01:44:11.134 --> 01:44:14.686
So we'd shoot you guys watching the TV

01:44:14.721 --> 01:44:17.641
like you're watching a news report
of yourselves, celebrating.

01:44:17.676 --> 01:44:20.143
No, I'm not doing that.
I'm not a fuckin' monkey.

01:44:27.234 --> 01:44:28.728
<i>Can I dial out from here?</i>

01:44:40.456 --> 01:44:43.706
No, these might be different.
They're OK? Alright.

01:44:48.297 --> 01:44:50.171
Don't know that we need that, do we?

01:44:52.551 --> 01:44:54.094
Hi.

01:44:56.681 --> 01:45:00.935
I just want you to know I don't
bear you any ill will, Mr Leckie.

01:45:00.970 --> 01:45:02.819
I really don't.

01:45:02.854 --> 01:45:04.763
You were just doing your job.

01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:10.271
I hope you catch the people
who did that terrible thing.

01:45:18.912 --> 01:45:21.581
If you're as smart
as I think you are,

01:45:21.616 --> 01:45:23.256
you'd know to walk right on by me

01:45:23.291 --> 01:45:25.460
like we've never seen each other
before in our lives,

01:45:25.495 --> 01:45:27.417
and you'd know to feel lucky.

01:45:29.589 --> 01:45:31.084
You'll come unstuck.

01:45:32.592 --> 01:45:34.469
I've got a feeling about it.

01:45:34.504 --> 01:45:35.750
I think you do too.

01:45:38.015 --> 01:45:40.017
I reckon you probably carry
that feeling around with you

01:45:40.052 --> 01:45:41.428
every second of the day.

01:45:43.187 --> 01:45:44.729
But I don't, Nathan.

01:46:00.830 --> 01:46:02.324
Hey, Grandma.

01:46:07.837 --> 01:46:09.545
I was wondering when I'd see you again.

01:46:11.591 --> 01:46:14.010
Been missing ya.

01:46:14.045 --> 01:46:16.269
You OK?

01:46:16.304 --> 01:46:17.882
Yeah, I'm OK.

01:46:20.308 --> 01:46:23.412
Um, is it OK if I move back here?

01:46:23.447 --> 01:46:26.517
I don't really know where else to go.

01:46:27.941 --> 01:46:30.325
Course.

01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:32.487
You want food?
You look Biafran.

01:46:32.522 --> 01:46:34.621
No, thanks.

01:46:34.656 --> 01:46:36.971
I think I want
to go lie down for a bit.

01:46:37.006 --> 01:46:39.286
You don't want to eat?
Pope's cookin'.

01:46:39.321 --> 01:46:41.305
No, thanks.

01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:43.255
OK, sweetie.

01:46:43.290 --> 01:46:44.950
Your room's still there.

01:46:50.547 --> 01:46:52.548
I've missed you.

01:46:52.583 --> 01:46:54.549
Say hi to the guys.

01:46:57.429 --> 01:46:59.515
You know what I mean?
It doesn't do anything.

01:46:59.550 --> 01:47:01.016
Doesn't cook anything, you know.

01:47:01.051 --> 01:47:01.965
Hey.

01:47:03.352 --> 01:47:04.937
Hey, mate.

01:47:08.232 --> 01:47:10.283
You hungry?

01:47:10.318 --> 01:47:12.212
No. I just came out to say hi.

01:47:12.247 --> 01:47:14.106
I'm gonna go lie down for a bit.

01:47:16.866 --> 01:47:18.609
Alright, mate.

01:47:53.028 --> 01:47:54.706
It's a crazy fuckin' world.
