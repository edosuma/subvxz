it will be a hell of a story.

25:33.741 --> 25:35.242

25:43.667 --> 25:45.461
Do you, uh,
do you want some help?

25:45.461 --> 25:46.587
Oh, no, no, no.

25:46.587 --> 25:48.380
I've got it, sweetie.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.470
Is this baby bondage gear?

25:54.470 --> 25:56.930
What do you think
these lightbulbs are for?

25:56.930 --> 25:58.223
The baby will have
sensitive eyes

25:58.223 --> 25:59.683
from the magic.

25:59.683 --> 26:03.854
Six months, you won't even
be able to tell at all.

26:03.854 --> 26:05.105
Okay.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.905

26:23.582 --> 26:25.501

26:25.501 --> 26:27.377
Where will the baby be sleeping?

26:27.377 --> 26:30.047
Oh, uh, well, we thought
maybe with us for a bit?

26:30.047 --> 26:32.925
It'd make the nighttime
feedings easier, and...

26:32.925 --> 26:34.259
And then?

26:34.259 --> 26:35.803
You have a bedroom
for your baby, right?

26:35.803 --> 26:37.513
Yeah.
The guestroom.

26:37.513 --> 26:38.722
Eric's old office.

26:38.722 --> 26:40.599
We were gonna convert it
after the baby was born--

26:40.599 --> 26:42.851
Oh no. It needs to be done now.

26:42.851 --> 26:45.604
Preparing the space
is part of the process.

26:45.604 --> 26:46.855
Oh. Okay.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.111
It's all gotta go.

26:53.111 --> 26:54.947
Can we move everything
to the garage?

26:54.947 --> 26:55.948
Not really.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.574
The baby's spirit
needs to know

26:57.574 --> 27:01.703
it will have
a dedicated space of its own.

27:01.703 --> 27:05.374
I'm sure you can
get it emptied by sunset.

27:05.374 --> 27:08.544
Sunset...today?

27:08.544 --> 27:10.087
I don't wanna delay.

27:10.087 --> 27:12.089
Heh. No.

27:12.089 --> 27:15.133

some good drugs off of her.
