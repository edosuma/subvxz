00:07.484 --> 00:10.581
Um, guys, what are you doing?

00:10.582 --> 00:14.685
Building the first ever musical
instrument domino course.

00:14.686 --> 00:17.326
Hit it, Austin.

00:37.409 --> 00:39.213
Well, that stunk.

00:39.214 --> 00:40.778
What? That was amazing!

00:40.779 --> 00:43.422
Yeah. I gotta admit
that was pretty cool.

00:43.423 --> 00:47.685
No, wasn't. At the end, pudding was
supposed to explode out of the tuba.

00:47.686 --> 00:49.615
What's the point of knocking
over all these instruments,

00:49.616 --> 00:51.455
if there's no pudding explosion?

00:51.456 --> 00:53.316
Ooh!

00:56.861 --> 01:00.253
Guess who got a job at...

01:00.254 --> 01:02.666
You got a job at...

01:02.667 --> 01:03.967
What kind of place is that?

01:03.968 --> 01:06.604
No, I got a job at
the sausage cart.

01:06.605 --> 01:08.031
I said...

01:08.032 --> 01:09.707
Because of that guy over there.

01:09.708 --> 01:11.742
I'm pretty sure
that's Jimmy Starr.

01:11.743 --> 01:13.827
He owns Starr Records.

01:13.828 --> 01:15.646
No way.

01:15.647 --> 01:17.781
He's one of the biggest
names in music!

01:17.782 --> 01:20.551
- I'm gonna get a better look.
- No, don't make it obvious.

01:20.552 --> 01:23.012
Ally, please.

01:23.265 --> 01:25.665
Jimmy Starr!

01:28.760 --> 01:30.837
It's him.

01:30.838 --> 01:34.207
No way. I've been giving his
son violin lessons for weeks.

01:34.208 --> 01:35.796
I had no idea.

01:35.797 --> 01:37.252
This is huge.

01:37.253 --> 01:41.199
Your best shot at a record deal
is sitting right over there.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.217
You know what you
need to do, right?

01:43.218 --> 01:44.908
Oh, yeah.

01:44.909 --> 01:47.285
I'll keep giving his
son lessons each week,

01:47.286 --> 01:50.137
dropping very subtle hints
about Austin's music.

01:50.138 --> 01:52.146
Then in four to five months...

01:52.147 --> 01:55.567
No, we're doing this now.

01:55.837 --> 01:59.737
Jimmy baby, how the heck are ya?

02:00.184 --> 02:02.497
Let's start with "who
the heck are you?"

02:02.498 --> 02:04.370
You know... Trish.

02:04.371 --> 02:07.491
We met at that thing.

02:07.650 --> 02:11.482
I'm pretty sure I'd remember
talking to a sausage.

02:11.483 --> 02:14.402
Okay, we've never met,
but I know who you are.

02:19.078 --> 02:21.421
Oh, I've heard of you.
My son's a fan.

02:21.422 --> 02:22.821
What are you working on now?

02:22.822 --> 02:26.211
Well, we just started writing this new
song called "The Way That You Do."

02:26.212 --> 02:28.934
Ah. Tell you what...

02:28.935 --> 02:31.343
I'll be back next week
for my son's lesson.

02:31.344 --> 02:33.091
Have a demo of that song ready.

02:33.092 --> 02:36.794
If I like it, you might just
have yourselves a record deal.

02:36.795 --> 02:38.155
- Awesome!
- Oh!

02:38.156 --> 02:41.099
- I'm gonna get a record deal!
- What up?

02:41.100 --> 02:44.400
I said "might" and "if."

02:45.605 --> 02:47.765
What up?

02:48.907 --> 02:50.975
I have a great
feeling about this.

02:50.976 --> 02:53.473
You're a Starr. Austin's a Moon.

02:53.474 --> 02:57.374
Together, you'll
rule the galaxy.

03:00.188 --> 03:05.948
I'm gonna stand over here where
I can't embarrass myself.

03:07.528 --> 03:10.108
Fixed it! Woo!

03:14.765 --> 03:17.867
<i>When the crowd wants more,
I bring on the thunder.</i>

03:17.868 --> 03:21.002
<i>'Cause you've got my back,
and I'm not going under.</i>

03:21.003 --> 03:22.534
<i>You're my point,
you're my guard.</i>

03:22.535 --> 03:24.153
<i>You're the perfect chord.</i>

03:24.154 --> 03:27.198
<i>And I see our names together
on every billboard.</i>

03:27.199 --> 03:30.257
<i>We're headed for the top,
we've got it on lock.</i>

03:30.258 --> 03:31.871
<i>We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

03:31.872 --> 03:34.194
<i>And we'll keep rockin'.</i>

03:34.195 --> 03:38.332
<i>Oh, there's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

03:38.333 --> 03:41.368
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:41.369 --> 03:44.438
<i>It's no fun when
you're doing it solo.</i>

03:44.439 --> 03:47.761
<i>With you it's like, "whoa".
Yeah, and I know.</i>

03:47.762 --> 03:50.411
<i>I own this dream.</i>

03:50.412 --> 03:53.789
<i>'Cause I got you with me.</i>

03:53.790 --> 03:56.907
<i>There's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

03:56.908 --> 04:01.228
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

04:02.801 --> 04:05.206
<i>No, oh oh oh oh.</i>

04:05.207 --> 04:06.667
<i>The way that you do.</i>

04:06.668 --> 04:08.669
<i>You're off the charts.</i>

04:08.670 --> 04:10.579
<i>You're ♪1.</i>

04:10.580 --> 04:15.318
<i>You've got the fire,
so keep burning it up!</i>

04:15.319 --> 04:17.711
Woo! I nailed the
bridge that time.

04:17.712 --> 04:19.613
That was great!

04:19.613 --> 04:22.361
One more time and I
think it'll be perfect.

04:22.362 --> 04:25.338
But we've been here for hours
and my throat's killing me.

04:25.339 --> 04:29.125
I know you're working hard, but this
demo has to be perfect for Jimmy Starr.

04:29.126 --> 04:31.885
Hey, he's not the only one
who's been working hard.

04:31.886 --> 04:37.786
I've been slaving over these cover
designs all night for Austin.

04:38.593 --> 04:40.481
My name's not on that.

04:40.482 --> 04:44.442
Okay, that's why
we have options.

04:46.935 --> 04:48.395
I've been working hard too.

04:48.396 --> 04:53.376
I've been glued to this
sound board all night.

04:54.943 --> 04:57.744
I have no idea how
this happened.

04:57.745 --> 04:59.783
Come on. We're in the zone.

04:59.784 --> 05:01.727
You know what they say...

05:01.728 --> 05:07.628
"Once that bacon gets grooving, there's
just no stopping that sizzle."

05:08.957 --> 05:13.997
Pretty sure you're the
only one that says that.

05:15.086 --> 05:18.127
All right, fine. One more
time and we'll call it quits.

05:18.128 --> 05:19.922
Dez, hit record.

05:19.923 --> 05:22.143
Recording!

05:23.004 --> 05:27.024
<i>You're off the
charts, you're ♪1.</i>

05:27.032 --> 05:31.892
<i>You've got the fire. So
keep burning it u...</i>

05:34.581 --> 05:37.821
<i>So keep burning it u...</i>

05:38.814 --> 05:41.454
<i>Burning it u...</i>

05:41.990 --> 05:43.541
I think something's wrong.

05:43.542 --> 05:45.485
Uh, yeah. It's supposed to be...

05:45.486 --> 05:47.358
<i>Burning it up!</i>

05:47.359 --> 05:51.439
<i>And you're going...
Burning it u...</i>

05:51.444 --> 05:53.828
No, there's something
wrong with my voice.

05:53.829 --> 05:58.029
- I... I can't hit that note.
- Yeah, you're telling me.

05:58.030 --> 06:02.423
Okay, nobody panic. I'm sure Austin will
be able to hit the note in the morning.

06:02.424 --> 06:04.875
All you need is a
good night's sleep.

06:04.876 --> 06:08.052
<i>So keep burning it u...</i>

06:08.053 --> 06:11.593
Okay, maybe two good nights.

06:12.505 --> 06:15.723
What's going on? I used to be able
to hit that note in my sleep.

06:15.724 --> 06:18.277
Oh, you sleep sing?
I sleep paint.

06:18.278 --> 06:22.658
Whipped up this little
puppy last night.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.320
I can't believe this
is happening now.

06:28.321 --> 06:30.189
Jimmy Starr's coming in a week.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.191
Austin, relax.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.426
So what if we don't have
a finished song for him?

06:34.427 --> 06:36.362
That just means we'll
lose the best chance

06:36.363 --> 06:38.330
we'll ever have of
getting a record deal.

06:38.331 --> 06:41.133
How that supposed
to make me relax?

06:41.134 --> 06:45.394
I don't know. I'm
not good at this.

06:45.550 --> 06:48.953
We should call your parents.
You need to go to the doctor.

06:48.954 --> 06:50.737
Wait!

06:50.738 --> 06:54.095
Before we go to the doctor, there's
something I wanna try first.

06:54.096 --> 06:56.800
It's lemon, garlic, beet
root, three blades of grass,

06:56.801 --> 07:01.420
fish oil, chicken liver
and one cup of mud.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.120
How's that gonna help my throat?

07:03.121 --> 07:08.881
It's not. It's just something
I've always wanted to try.

07:09.674 --> 07:12.254
Yep, I was right!

07:12.255 --> 07:14.955
It's disgusting.

07:22.030 --> 07:23.998
I hate doctors' offices.

07:23.999 --> 07:25.715
They always creep me out.

07:25.716 --> 07:28.252
What if there's something
really wrong with my voice?

07:28.253 --> 07:31.702
Don't worry, Austin. I'm sure
everything's gonna be fine.

07:31.703 --> 07:34.969
I remember when I was six I took
my pet goldfish Moby to the vet,

07:34.970 --> 07:37.035
and he was nervous too.

07:37.036 --> 07:39.287
And everything turned out fine?

07:39.288 --> 07:42.466
No, we had to flush him.

07:42.467 --> 07:46.236
Why do I keep trying
to cheer you up?

07:46.237 --> 07:49.047
Hey, we got you some
tea with honey.

07:49.048 --> 07:51.304
For my honey.

07:51.305 --> 07:52.889
- Thanks, mom.
- Yeah.

07:52.890 --> 07:55.127
So did they come back with
the test results yet?

07:55.128 --> 07:58.091
- No, we're still waiting.
- The service here stinks.

07:58.092 --> 08:01.342
You know, at our mattress store,
we get you in, we get you out,

08:01.343 --> 08:03.235
and we get you
sleeping in no time.

08:03.236 --> 08:04.644
Because...

08:04.645 --> 08:10.427
At Moon's Mattress Kingdom,
there's no hassle in our Castle.

08:10.428 --> 08:12.348
Mwah.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.334
Thanks for your patience, folks.

08:17.335 --> 08:19.513
Give it to us straight, doc.

08:19.514 --> 08:21.638
We can take it.

08:21.639 --> 08:22.886
Well, we ran some tests...

08:22.887 --> 08:24.687
No!

08:27.091 --> 08:30.013
I haven't given the results yet.

08:30.014 --> 08:31.814
Oh.

08:31.975 --> 08:34.075
Proceed.

08:36.453 --> 08:41.291
Well, it looks like Austin here
has nodules on his vocal chords.

08:41.292 --> 08:43.046
Nodules?

08:43.047 --> 08:45.447
Not nodules!

08:45.597 --> 08:47.796
What are nodules?

08:47.797 --> 08:49.956
Don't worry. It's
not that serious.

08:49.957 --> 08:52.110
But if left untreated,

08:52.111 --> 08:54.825
it could prevent you
from ever singing again.

08:54.826 --> 08:56.206
- What?
- That's terrible.

08:56.207 --> 08:59.609
Oh, I see. And how will
it affect his dancing?

08:59.610 --> 09:01.968
Does he have to be in here?

09:01.969 --> 09:03.985
Welcome to my world, doc.

09:03.986 --> 09:06.788
What kind of treatment
options are there, doctor?

09:06.789 --> 09:10.379
Well, there's a very simple procedure
that can cure Austin completely.

09:10.380 --> 09:12.036
And it has a quick
recovery time,

09:12.037 --> 09:15.211
so you could be singing again
in less than a week...

09:15.212 --> 09:17.521
See? I told you there was
nothing to worry about.

09:17.522 --> 09:19.403
But there are some
possible side effects.

09:19.404 --> 09:22.440
See? I told you there was
something to worry about.

09:22.441 --> 09:23.973
What are the side effects?

09:23.974 --> 09:26.484
Well, there's a chance
with the procedure...

09:26.485 --> 09:30.296
That Austin's voice may
be permanently altered.

09:30.297 --> 09:33.418
Wait. If I don't
have the procedure,

09:33.419 --> 09:35.209
I may never sing again.

09:35.210 --> 09:38.394
But if I do, I may never
sing the same again?

09:38.395 --> 09:39.873
That's correct.

09:39.874 --> 09:43.050
Remind me again, doc... Where
did we land on the dancing?

09:43.051 --> 09:46.651
Seriously, you need to leave.

09:59.101 --> 10:04.138
Hey, Austin. We feel bad about what you're
going through, so we got you some gifts.

10:04.139 --> 10:07.288
I knitted you a scarf
with all our names on it.

10:07.289 --> 10:12.449
- Thanks.
- I got you a giant get-well-soon card.

10:15.330 --> 10:17.637
And I'm gonna sign the
giant get-well-soon card,

10:17.638 --> 10:21.255
because I didn't know
we were doing gifts.

10:21.256 --> 10:23.124
Thanks, guys.

10:23.125 --> 10:25.695
We're really sorry we
pushed you so hard.

10:25.696 --> 10:28.524
We feel like it's our fault
your voice is damaged.

10:28.525 --> 10:30.771
Don't feel bad. It's
not your fault.

10:30.772 --> 10:35.464
I know. That's why I
didn't get you anything.

10:35.465 --> 10:37.633
I just don't know what to
do about this procedure.

10:37.634 --> 10:39.568
Oh, it's a tough decision.

10:39.569 --> 10:41.091
Let's make a pros and cons list.

10:41.092 --> 10:45.307
Oh! I love pros and cons lists.
You wanna know why?

10:45.308 --> 10:47.394
Pro... They make
decisions easier.

10:47.395 --> 10:51.347
Con... There isn't one!
I love them!

10:51.348 --> 10:52.963
Okay, Austin, go ahead.

10:52.964 --> 10:58.752
Well, pro... With the procedure,
I'll be able to sing again.

10:58.753 --> 11:03.672
Con... With the side effects, I may
end up sounding like a chipmunk.

11:03.673 --> 11:07.093
Or a bottle-nosed dolphin.

11:07.115 --> 11:08.706
Dez...

11:08.707 --> 11:11.467
He's not going to
sound like a dolphin.

11:11.468 --> 11:13.402
Uh, we don't know that.

11:13.403 --> 11:18.746
I mean, I don't wanna worry you,
but you could sound like anything.

11:18.747 --> 11:21.507
I'm not worried.

11:23.025 --> 11:24.780
Hey, everybody. Thanks
for coming out.

11:24.781 --> 11:28.166
This song is called...
"Break Down The Walls."

11:28.167 --> 11:31.647
<i>Break down the walls, whoa!</i>

11:32.288 --> 11:36.608
<i>Don't be afraid to
let things fall...</i>

11:38.815 --> 11:41.704
Looks like we're having some
technical difficulties.

11:41.705 --> 11:45.125
Let me try one more time.

11:46.708 --> 11:49.288
Boo! Boo! Boo!

11:55.110 --> 11:58.646
I don't wanna sound like a dolphin!
What should I do?

11:58.647 --> 12:01.021
This is the toughest decision
I've ever had to make.

12:01.022 --> 12:03.385
Decisions are easy...
Just flip a coin.

12:03.386 --> 12:06.478
Let's see. I've got a
quarter, a nickel and a dime.

12:06.479 --> 12:08.409
Which one should I flip?

12:08.410 --> 12:12.250
Man! Decisions are hard to make.

12:12.495 --> 12:13.815
Forget it, Dez.

12:13.816 --> 12:15.681
We should probably
call Jimmy Starr,

12:15.682 --> 12:18.146
and tell him we need a little
more time to finish our demo.

12:18.147 --> 12:20.615
Okay, I'll handle it.
I'm your manager.

12:20.616 --> 12:24.440
It's my job to make
your life easier.

12:24.441 --> 12:26.632
Jimmy baby, it's Trish.

12:26.633 --> 12:29.803
Listen, we're gonna need a
little more time with that demo.

12:29.804 --> 12:32.399
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Perfect!

12:32.400 --> 12:34.195
- Yes!
- So we got more time?

12:34.196 --> 12:38.636
Actually, no. He wants
it a day earlier.

12:41.471 --> 12:44.266
I know you got your heart set
on a music career, kiddo,

12:44.267 --> 12:46.915
but you ought a take this
throat thing as a sign.

12:46.916 --> 12:49.531
Yeah, sweetie. Look,
we love your music,

12:49.532 --> 12:53.863
but why take a risk when you've got a
sure thing in the family business?

12:53.864 --> 12:56.371
I don't wanna spend my
life selling mattresses.

12:56.372 --> 12:58.373
Don't you wanna be
part of a legacy?

12:58.374 --> 13:02.165
Your mother and I are the
mattress King and Queen of Miami.

13:02.166 --> 13:06.562
- You know what that makes you?
- Embarrassed?

13:06.563 --> 13:11.115
You're the Prince of Moon's
Mattress Kingdom, and one day

13:11.116 --> 13:13.758
- that kingdom will be yours to rule.
- Mm-hmm.

13:13.759 --> 13:16.940
But in a few days, he could
have a deal at Starr Records.

13:16.941 --> 13:21.213
Yeah, I'm so close, and
performing's my dream.

13:21.214 --> 13:24.158
You get that from me. I
love to perform too.

13:24.159 --> 13:27.469
- It's true, you do. You do.
- And you still get to do that in our job.

13:27.470 --> 13:32.330
- Have you seen our latest commercial?
- Right.

13:35.032 --> 13:38.794
Come on down to Moon's
Mattress Kingdom.

13:38.795 --> 13:43.719
Where our mattresses are firm
and our prices are soft.

13:43.720 --> 13:48.890
This week we hereby declare
all mattresses half off.

13:48.891 --> 13:51.771
Huh? Come on, son.

13:52.207 --> 13:53.898
Say the slogan with us.

13:53.899 --> 13:59.145
- I don't really want to.
- Oh, come on, Prince Austin.

13:59.146 --> 14:01.863
Moon's Mattress Kingdom.

14:01.864 --> 14:05.541
There's no hassle in our Castle.

14:05.542 --> 14:07.462
Mwah!

14:09.743 --> 14:11.917
Well, son, you've got
a lot to think about.

14:11.918 --> 14:14.192
Yeah, we'll see you
at home, sweetie.

14:14.193 --> 14:17.262
You look so cute in
your little crown.

14:17.263 --> 14:19.783
Your highness.

14:20.043 --> 14:21.823
Hello.

14:21.824 --> 14:23.399
I'm doing the procedure.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.177
Are you sure?

14:25.178 --> 14:29.750
Yeah, I don't want to be the mattress
Prince, and singing's my life.

14:29.751 --> 14:31.986
What if the procedure
doesn't work?

14:31.987 --> 14:34.135
This could end your career.

14:34.136 --> 14:37.859
Then either way
my career's over.

14:37.860 --> 14:40.808
I can't believe I might
never sing again.

14:40.809 --> 14:42.659
I made up my mind.

14:42.660 --> 14:45.434
I have to take this chance.

14:45.435 --> 14:49.900
I don't know what I would do if I
couldn't sing the songs you write for me.

14:49.901 --> 14:52.481
Thanks, Austin.

14:54.773 --> 14:58.433
I'm gonna go call Dr. Grant.

15:04.890 --> 15:07.840
'Ello, I'm Princess Ally.

15:07.841 --> 15:11.488
Oh, of course I'll kiss you, Mr.
Frog.

15:11.489 --> 15:14.549
- Ally!
- Uh, coming.

15:20.092 --> 15:22.885
Oh, I can't wait to see Austin.

15:22.886 --> 15:24.753
It's been two days
since his procedure.

15:24.754 --> 15:26.884
Dez, are you almost done
with those balloons?

15:26.885 --> 15:29.447
Yup, I just blew
up 100 balloons.

15:29.448 --> 15:33.288
Now all I gotta do is tie 'em.

15:36.833 --> 15:39.833
Austin, welcome back!

15:40.494 --> 15:41.609
Welcome back, buddy.

15:41.610 --> 15:45.810
What do you think
of the decorations?

15:46.381 --> 15:48.937
Fine. Really, the
silent treatment?

15:48.938 --> 15:54.488
I just almost sorta nearly blew
up 100 balloons for you. Pf ft!

15:54.489 --> 15:57.446
No, the doctor put Austin
under strict vocal rest

15:57.447 --> 15:59.297
to make sure his
throat heals properly.

15:59.298 --> 16:02.011
He has to remain
silent for 48 hours.

16:02.012 --> 16:03.939
Only 12 more to go.

16:03.940 --> 16:07.875
The doctor says it's crucial
that Austin doesn't say a word.

16:07.876 --> 16:10.756
Got it. What word?

16:11.441 --> 16:13.274
He can't say anything.

16:13.275 --> 16:15.785
Got it. He can't say
the word "anything."

16:15.786 --> 16:18.547
Well, that shouldn't
be too hard.

16:18.548 --> 16:20.437
He can't speak at all.

16:20.438 --> 16:23.858
Maybe you should try that.

16:28.974 --> 16:32.688
I know you can't talk, buddy, so I came
up with a foolproof communication system

16:32.689 --> 16:34.575
using these colored scarves.

16:34.576 --> 16:37.179
It's easy. Just wave the blue
scarf if you're thirsty.

16:37.180 --> 16:39.239
The green is to signal danger.
The red...

16:39.240 --> 16:40.851
Oh, wait. No, the red
is to signal danger.

16:40.852 --> 16:42.883
The green is if you spot a snake.
Or was that the purple?

16:42.884 --> 16:44.842
Anyway, the pink is if
you're late for prom.

16:44.843 --> 16:47.241
Put all three of these
together if you need a coffee.

16:47.242 --> 16:52.762
Yellow? There's a spider on your shirt?!
I'll get it.

16:53.065 --> 16:55.033
I'm gonna get you, buddy. I'm
gonna help you. I'm helping you.

16:55.034 --> 16:57.035
I know spiders are dangerous.
Just let me help you.

16:57.036 --> 17:02.223
Come on. It's okay. It's okay.
Where is it? Where is it?

17:02.224 --> 17:05.376
I brought you some hot soup to
make your throat feel better.

17:05.377 --> 17:06.623
You're doing great.

17:06.624 --> 17:09.300
You only have to be quiet
for six more hours.

17:09.301 --> 17:12.422
How hard can that be?

17:13.952 --> 17:17.852
It's okay. I'll scream for you.

17:38.243 --> 17:41.708
"That girl is checking me out.
Help me."

17:41.709 --> 17:46.029
Oh, I got you. I'll
take care of it.

17:46.948 --> 17:51.398
Quit staring at my friend!
You're freaking him out!

17:51.399 --> 17:54.039
You're welcome.

17:58.896 --> 18:03.167
I wonder if I could not talk for 48 hours.
Granted, I'm not much of a talker.

18:03.168 --> 18:06.908
Sure, I talk sometimes. I'm not
not a talker, but when I do...

18:06.909 --> 18:09.107
Yeah, I couldn't do it.

18:09.108 --> 18:13.763
Only a few hours left. I can't believe you
went two whole days without saying a word.

18:13.764 --> 18:15.580
That's why you're
my best friend.

18:15.581 --> 18:17.741
What up?

18:18.495 --> 18:19.951
Austin, you talked.

18:19.952 --> 18:21.422
I wasn't thinking.

18:21.423 --> 18:24.724
But the 48 hours aren't up yet. Do
you think you ruined your voice?

18:24.725 --> 18:27.447
- I don't know.
- Why do you keep talking?!

18:27.448 --> 18:30.165
Because you keep
asking me questions!

18:30.166 --> 18:31.664
Let's all stop talking.

18:31.665 --> 18:33.844
We'll keep Austin quiet
for a couple more hours,

18:33.845 --> 18:36.526
we'll record the demo and by the
time Jimmy gets here, we'll be...

18:36.527 --> 18:38.093
Uh, guys.

18:38.094 --> 18:39.550
Change of plans, kids.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.083
I'm catching a plane in
an hour, so I wanted

18:41.084 --> 18:45.132
to pop by and get that
demo a little early.

18:45.133 --> 18:47.083
Look over there!

18:47.084 --> 18:48.944
Run!

18:52.293 --> 18:55.962
That's all I got.
Somebody else got a plan?

18:55.963 --> 18:59.959
Look, Mr. Starr, I hate to say
this, but we don't have your demo.

18:59.960 --> 19:02.369
We thought we'd have a couple
more hours to finish it.

19:02.370 --> 19:05.706
Oh, that's too bad. I don't
have a couple more hours.

19:05.707 --> 19:08.965
Guess I won't be
signing you after all.

19:08.966 --> 19:12.626
Mr. Starr, wait, don't leave.

19:14.096 --> 19:16.027
- I'm gonna perform the song live.
- What?

19:16.028 --> 19:17.741
- Huh?
- Cool.

19:17.742 --> 19:21.355
That works. All right,
just make it fast.

19:21.356 --> 19:24.458
Give us five minutes.
We'll be ready.

19:24.459 --> 19:26.493
Dez, you know what to do.

19:26.494 --> 19:29.194
Yes. Yes, I do.

19:30.565 --> 19:33.534
What are you doing? You haven't had
a chance to test out your voice.

19:33.535 --> 19:37.731
What if you permanently damaged it?
What if you can't hit the notes?

19:37.732 --> 19:41.435
Well, we're about to find out.

19:41.436 --> 19:43.896
Hit it, Dez.

19:45.239 --> 19:48.343
<i>Sometimes it feels like
you lost your swag.</i>

19:48.344 --> 19:52.541
<i>You've got a "kick me" sign
covering the skills that you have.</i>

19:52.542 --> 19:56.686
<i>And it all looks wrong
when you're looking down.</i>

19:56.687 --> 19:58.921
<i>You get dizzy doing 360s.</i>

19:58.922 --> 20:01.022
<i>And you can't break out.</i>

20:01.023 --> 20:02.763
<i>Even when you feel like
you ain't all that.</i>

20:02.764 --> 20:04.698
<i>Just don't forget
that I got your back.</i>

20:04.699 --> 20:07.068
<i>Now turn up the beat
and bump that track.</i>

20:07.069 --> 20:08.278
<i>Bump that track.</i>

20:08.279 --> 20:12.161
<i>Yeah, nobody rocks it
the way that you do.</i>

20:12.162 --> 20:14.329
<i>You've got style,
pop your collar.</i>

20:14.330 --> 20:16.217
<i>Because you're all
kinds of cool.</i>

20:16.218 --> 20:18.368
<i>You're legit, you're the boss.</i>

20:18.369 --> 20:20.814
<i>Even when the mic is off.</i>

20:20.815 --> 20:23.583
<i>Nobody rocks it, ro-rocks it.</i>

20:23.584 --> 20:25.275
<i>The way that you do.</i>

20:25.276 --> 20:27.503
<i>No, oh oh oh oh.</i>

20:27.504 --> 20:30.598
<i>The way that you do.
You're off the charts...</i>

20:30.599 --> 20:33.336
- Here comes the high note.
- Shh! Austin's singing.

20:33.337 --> 20:38.197
<i>You've got the fire so
keep burning it... Up!</i>

20:38.198 --> 20:41.801
<i>Nobody rocks it the
way that you do.</i>

20:41.802 --> 20:44.177
<i>You've got style,
pop your collar.</i>

20:44.178 --> 20:46.138
<i>Because you're all
kinds of cool.</i>

20:46.139 --> 20:48.145
<i>You're legit, you're the boss.</i>

20:48.146 --> 20:50.497
<i>Even when the mic is off.</i>

20:50.498 --> 20:53.231
<i>Nobody rocks it, ro-rocks it.</i>

20:53.232 --> 20:56.292
<i>The way that you do.</i>

21:01.221 --> 21:03.824
Austin Moon, I've been in
this business a long time

21:03.825 --> 21:06.478
and talent like yours doesn't
come around every day.

21:06.479 --> 21:11.231
How would you like a
contract with Starr Records?

21:11.232 --> 21:12.905
Well, I'll take that as a yes?

21:12.906 --> 21:14.100
Yes!

21:14.101 --> 21:16.867
Then you have yourself a deal.

21:16.868 --> 21:20.286
- Woo-hoo!
- We always knew this day would come.

21:20.287 --> 21:25.567
That's why we got you a
giant congratulations card.

21:28.014 --> 21:32.863
And once again, no one told me we
were getting anything for you.

21:32.864 --> 21:35.144
Hmm. Mint?

21:43.089 --> 21:46.761
Come on down to Moon's
Mattress Kingdom.

21:46.762 --> 21:51.915
Where our mattresses are firm
and our prices are soft.

21:51.916 --> 21:55.241
This week we hereby
declare all mattresses...

21:55.242 --> 21:57.462
Half off.

21:58.165 --> 22:00.754
Our prices are the best in town.

22:00.755 --> 22:02.589
But don't take it from us.

22:02.590 --> 22:05.129
Take it from Starr Records
recording artist...

22:05.130 --> 22:07.530
Austin Moon.

22:10.532 --> 22:13.377
Yup, their prices are
the best in town.

22:13.378 --> 22:16.714
So come on down to
Moon's Mattress Kingdom.

22:16.715 --> 22:20.615
There's no hassle in our Castle.

22:20.642 --> 22:22.562
Mwah.

22:23.678 --> 22:26.488
Oh, that's my little Prince.

22:26.489 --> 22:28.349
Mom!
