00:04.471 --> 00:08.498
O come let us adore him.

00:08.676 --> 00:12.942
O come let us adore him.

00:13.113 --> 00:18.244
O come let us adore him.

00:18.419 --> 00:24.449
Christ the Lord.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.525
All donations go
to our local soup kitchen.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.252
Sure.

00:29.129 --> 00:31.689
- Here you go.
- Happy holidays, thank you.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.093
- Happy holidays.
- Thank you.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.928
- We appreciate it.
- Have a great night.

00:35.102 --> 00:36.933
- Were you off-key?
- No way.

00:37.104 --> 00:39.299
Did you see the wife
adjusting her hair and makeup

00:39.540 --> 00:40.939
as soon as I turned on the camera?

00:41.108 --> 00:44.475
That's nothing. Last year
a guy tried to slip me his screenplay.

00:44.645 --> 00:47.011
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:48.949 --> 00:50.780
Hey, did we stop
at this house last year?

00:50.951 --> 00:53.317
- No, I don't remember.
- Well, let's try it.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.653
Let's do "Silent Night."

01:00.527 --> 01:01.824
Ready, guys?

01:04.831 --> 01:09.633
Silent night.

01:09.803 --> 01:14.433
Holy night.

01:14.608 --> 01:18.009
All is calm.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.072
What the hell was that?

01:25.953 --> 01:27.750
Come on.

01:29.757 --> 01:30.781
Come on.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.357
- Alice.
- Come on.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.992
Come on, hurry.

01:34.161 --> 01:36.288
Come on, let's go.

01:36.463 --> 01:38.556
Come on.

01:41.702 --> 01:45.194
Please, help me.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.227
Awesome.

02:10.997 --> 02:13.398
Hold on there, little drummer boy.
Let's talk about this.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.325
- Aye, aye, Ebenezer.
- Hetty's never given us anything.

02:16.503 --> 02:17.834
- Why this year?
- Exactly.

02:18.038 --> 02:19.335
She knows I like surprises.

02:19.540 --> 02:22.031
Ever feel like we're struck babysitting
some kid whose parents

02:22.209 --> 02:23.335
won't come and get him?

02:23.544 --> 02:27.810
Sam is like the Grinch
who stole Christmas except for bigger.

02:30.884 --> 02:34.047
Ah, you all have your gifts.

02:34.254 --> 02:36.654
Dare we ask what we did
to deserve this, Hetty?

02:36.857 --> 02:40.691
Rest assured, Mr. Callen,
I never give gifts

02:40.861 --> 02:44.695
unless they perfectly suit
the recipients.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.423
And perfection struck
four times today?

02:50.270 --> 02:53.137
Happy holidays, everyone.

02:54.641 --> 02:57.007
What's everybody doing
for Christmas?

02:57.177 --> 03:00.146
Buy G
as much beer as he can drink.

03:00.347 --> 03:01.575
Explain, please.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.512
I scored two tickets
to the Lakers-Heat.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.014
- Courtside.
- Nice.

03:05.219 --> 03:07.153
Wow, enjoy Kobe and LeBron.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.015
A little jealousy over there,
Deeks?

03:09.223 --> 03:11.191
About you guys, on your man-date,
a little bit.

03:11.358 --> 03:14.452
That's okay, that's okay.
I'll be seeing somebody special.

03:14.661 --> 03:17.687
- Oh, you have a date on Christmas?
- Fact.

03:17.898 --> 03:21.129
More people hook up on
national holidays than any other day.

03:21.301 --> 03:22.359
Look it up.

03:22.569 --> 03:24.594
Where? Player's Almanac?

03:24.805 --> 03:28.104
- How about you?
- Family.

03:28.308 --> 03:29.570
You have family in L. A?

03:29.777 --> 03:33.474
Nope, in, um, Seattle.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.447
Hetty's idea of the perfect gift for me
is a spice rack?

03:39.620 --> 03:42.180
- Nice spice rack.
- If you don't want it, I'll take it.

03:42.389 --> 03:45.051
- No, no, no, that's a nice spice rack.
- I know.

03:45.259 --> 03:48.888
Bought that for her myself.
I bought it for Hetty. Christmas, 2008.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.290
A scented candle?

03:50.464 --> 03:52.762
- It smells like sage.
- Jasmine.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.797
I gave that to Hetty two years ago.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.799
- Same scent?
- Same candle.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.801
- I'll take it.
- What? No, no.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.270
Excuse me, I did not
give that to you. Hand it over.

04:01.442 --> 04:04.138
No, no, you gave it to Hetty,
who gave it to Callen,

04:04.344 --> 04:06.437
who is right now realizing
he has absolutely no use

04:06.647 --> 04:08.205
for a jasmine-scented candle.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.814
I gave those.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.848
Christmas, 2008. l...

04:12.019 --> 04:13.213
I don't believe it.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.911
Cool. Bookends.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.488
- Hetty's a re-gifter.
- Huh.

04:19.526 --> 04:21.084
- Hetty's a re-gifter.
- Ha, ha.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.663
Oh, are you kidding me?
That's what I'm talking about.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.198
That is awesome. Scarf.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.028
Do you know this?
My favorite color.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.669
What?
I gave that to Hetty a year ago.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.931
- It would look better on me.
- Not the point.

04:34.141 --> 04:36.234
- You didn't have to.
- I didn't.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.808
Look, the good news is,

04:37.978 --> 04:40.310
she didn't re-gift that sweater
from last Christmas.

04:40.514 --> 04:43.039
Do you remember with the reindeer
and the snowflakes?

04:43.283 --> 04:44.614
Hey.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.520
That came from me too. Okay?

04:48.689 --> 04:52.284
And maybe she didn't re-gift it
because she liked it.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.192
Yeah.

04:54.361 --> 04:59.128
Or maybe because no one wears
a size extra, extra, extra small but her.

05:01.268 --> 05:02.667
Join me, my friends.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.771
The crime gods
have given us a holiday gift.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.466
Uh, it's from Hetty.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.768
She said she thought
it was the perfect present.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.502
That was me,
three Christmases ago.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.647
Hetty was going
through her goose-hunting phase.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.749
- Nice spice rack.
- I know, I love it.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.578
Meet Lieutenant Lance Talbot.

05:18.785 --> 05:21.253
Recently discharged
Navy intelligence officer.

05:21.421 --> 05:23.981
Why does he look like an extra
from a slasher film?

05:24.191 --> 05:27.558
Well, he tried to revive
one of the victims. So it's not his blood.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.162
The footage is from a group
of Christmas carollers.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.195
They heard gunshots
inside Talbot's house.

05:32.399 --> 05:35.334
According to L.A.P.D.,
he witnessed a shoot-out in his home

05:35.502 --> 05:37.527
that resulted in two men dead.

05:37.738 --> 05:38.796
Why was he discharged?

05:39.006 --> 05:40.206
Post-traumatic stress disorder

05:40.374 --> 05:42.239
he suffered from his deployment
in Afghanistan.

05:42.442 --> 05:43.739
PTSD?

05:43.944 --> 05:46.674
What's a desk jockey like him
doing on the front lines?

05:46.847 --> 05:49.179
During his deployment,
the Defence Intelligence Agency

05:49.349 --> 05:51.249
located a group
of Afghani tribal leaders

05:51.418 --> 05:53.750
willing to work with Americans
against the Taliban.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.165
Taliban found out these leaders
would be marked for death.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.453
Which is why their identities
are highly classified.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.627
Lieutenant Talbot was tasked
with debriefing each one of them.

06:01.828 --> 06:02.852
He knows their names.

06:03.063 --> 06:06.430
If this guy opens his mouth,
the bodies could start piling up.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.931
Who was killed in the shoot-out?

06:08.402 --> 06:09.892
One victim was the Navy corpsman

06:10.070 --> 06:13.130
responsible for administering Talbot's
medication each day.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.438
Ensign Eric Scott.

06:15.642 --> 06:19.544
Now, L.A.P.D. Nailed him
nine years ago for drug possession

06:19.713 --> 06:20.873
but he never did time.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.276
Only family Talbot's
got is an ex-wife

06:23.450 --> 06:25.077
from an annulled marriage
ten years ago.

06:25.252 --> 06:27.652
So the nurse was the one taking care
of him regularly.

06:27.854 --> 06:30.482
The other victim was
John Mancuso.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.055
He's got a history of drub busts.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.749
He's a small-time drug dealer,

06:33.961 --> 06:37.328
but no known connection
to, uh, Lieutenant Talbot.

06:37.497 --> 06:40.398
However,
phone records show regular calls

06:40.567 --> 06:43.161
between Scott and Mancuso
over the past six months.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.268
Are we sure that Talbot's
just a witness?

06:45.472 --> 06:46.905
L.A.P.D. Seems to think so.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.941
He was shot in the hand, but
it could've been a defensive wound.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.304
Put his hand up
to protect himself taking a bullet.

06:52.479 --> 06:54.310
The ER said it was a minor wound.

06:54.481 --> 06:56.972
After being treated,
he was released into police custody.

06:57.150 --> 07:00.142
But as of now, this case is ours.

07:00.387 --> 07:01.445
This case is ours

07:01.622 --> 07:05.023
because NCIS doesn't want him
disclosing classified intel.

07:05.192 --> 07:07.626
Intel that could get our allies
in Afghanistan killed.

07:07.828 --> 07:10.922
We need a forensics report
to determine what really happened.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.258
L.A.P.D. Says it will take
at least three days

07:13.433 --> 07:15.492
for us to get a finalized
crime-scene report.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.433
Three weeks. This time of year,
half of the department's cashing in

07:18.639 --> 07:20.539
on accumulated vacation time.

07:20.707 --> 07:23.767
Does anyone have a ball of string
and duct tape?

07:24.277 --> 07:26.268
That's...

07:26.446 --> 07:27.674
Hold it, please.

07:29.316 --> 07:32.046
Sam is Talbot.
Callen is Scott, the nurse.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.686
Deeks is Mancuso, the drug dealer.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.718
I'm just wondering why I'm the guy
with duct tape on my forehead?

07:36.957 --> 07:38.424
Because it looks good on you.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.115
We're working on bullet trajectories.

07:40.327 --> 07:42.420
Somebody is very official today.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.824
You're still upset
about the spice rack?

07:45.032 --> 07:48.365
I don't run around
giving gifts to just anyone.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.526
It takes a cold-blooded woman
to do me like that.

07:50.704 --> 07:54.470
And you put a lot of thought
into the spice rack and the sweater?

07:54.675 --> 07:56.666
Do you still have
those steak knives I gave you?

07:58.578 --> 08:01.479
- Yes.
- Okay.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.810
- You're visiting family in Seattle, huh?
- Yep.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.646
Interesting.
You've never mentioned them.

08:06.853 --> 08:07.877
You never asked.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.716
- What part of Seattle?
- The west.

08:09.890 --> 08:12.984
That is a direction on a compass,
not a town or suburb.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.957
- You wouldn't know it.
- Yeah, right.

08:15.162 --> 08:18.893
My knowledge of imaginary cities with
imaginary family is, in fact, lacking.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.864
So hey, what are you really doing
for Christmas?

08:22.035 --> 08:23.400
Talbot is sitting at the table.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.905
Scott comes in
to administer his meds as usual.

08:28.075 --> 08:30.236
He uses his own key
to let himself in.

08:30.410 --> 08:34.107
But then Mancuso
arrives unexpectedly.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.780
Scott has a known history
of drug use.

08:36.982 --> 08:38.416
Mancuso's a drug dealer.

08:38.585 --> 08:39.779
Confrontation ensues.

08:39.986 --> 08:42.510
They're both carrying.
They pull out their weapons, open fire.

08:42.722 --> 08:43.883
Chaos breaks out.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.252
Talbot sees his friend
as being threatened.

08:46.426 --> 08:47.791
Lunges at Mancuso.

08:47.994 --> 08:51.088
Mancuso starts firing 9 mm rounds
from his Glock,

08:51.264 --> 08:53.892
hits Scott three times in the torso,

08:54.067 --> 08:57.730
two strays go out the window
and hits Talbot in the hand,

08:57.938 --> 09:02.068
which gives Scott the opening
to aim his Smith and Wesson

09:02.275 --> 09:06.712
.357 for the kill shot.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.642
Scott took three shots to the torso.

09:08.815 --> 09:10.578
He drops down. He bleeds out.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.241
Talbot revived his friend,

09:12.886 --> 09:15.946
which is why he ends up covered
in the nurse's blood and his own.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.886
Right.

09:19.059 --> 09:22.324
But there's an anomaly
that's bugging me.

09:22.529 --> 09:24.429
Scott must have walked
across the room

09:24.598 --> 09:27.499
with three gunshot wounds
to his torso,

09:27.667 --> 09:29.658
in order to execute Mancuso.

09:29.903 --> 09:33.270
I'd say it's a pretty solid chain of events
considering all we had prior to this

09:33.440 --> 09:35.738
was Colonel Mustard
in the study with a candlestick.

09:36.843 --> 09:40.404
The only one who can confirm or deny
the details is Talbot himself.

09:40.614 --> 09:41.672
Let's bring him in.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.909
What? Don't just...

09:46.086 --> 09:48.054
Ouch.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.855
Oh, it burns.

09:51.358 --> 09:52.416
Talbot's cell phone.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.459
Six very angry messages on it,
all from his nurse, Scott.

09:55.662 --> 09:57.926
Said he knew
what Talbot was planning but...

09:58.999 --> 10:02.457
After talking to this guy, I don't think
he's capable of planning a grocery list.

10:02.669 --> 10:05.365
Did Talbot tell you anything
about their relationship?

10:05.572 --> 10:08.268
He said Scott
was the only friend he had.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.471
He's all yours now.
Merry Christmas.

10:11.678 --> 10:12.770
Merry Christmas.

10:14.648 --> 10:15.876
Who are you guys?

10:16.082 --> 10:18.209
Agent Callen. Agent Hanna.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.884
NCIS.

10:21.488 --> 10:24.116
I never thought I'd be glad
to see NCIS show up.

10:24.291 --> 10:28.022
Yeah, I could tell the police
were getting frustrated with me.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.460
My, uh, memory
is not what it used to be.

10:30.664 --> 10:33.326
The doctors say
it's a result of my condition.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.899
We wanna ask you questions
about what happened last night.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.537
- Do you remember anything?
- Just bits and pieces.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.799
The car is just over here.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.015
Talbot.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.222
What's wrong with you?

11:06.433 --> 11:07.832
Who are you guys?

11:08.034 --> 11:09.433
NCIS, remember?

11:10.270 --> 11:12.204
I'm sorry, it's just...

11:12.372 --> 11:14.670
My memory
is not what it used to be.

11:14.875 --> 11:18.038
The doctors tell me
it's a result of my condition.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.539
What happened to my hand?

11:24.860 --> 11:27.556
- Come on.
- Come on.

11:42.467 --> 11:44.560
Hang in there, Lance.

11:51.643 --> 11:54.203
Is there anything else
we should know about him?

11:54.412 --> 11:56.676
Something that might assist us
with this case?

11:57.182 --> 12:00.811
Doesn't doctor-patient confidentiality
mean anything at NCIS these days?

12:01.319 --> 12:04.413
Doctor, there are no cameras
or microphones in this room.

12:04.589 --> 12:05.817
This is off the record.

12:06.424 --> 12:09.825
Anything you know
could make a big difference for him.

12:10.595 --> 12:14.588
He experiences bouts of amnesia
and disorientation on a daily basis.

12:15.166 --> 12:18.033
His grasp of reality
is tenuous at best.

12:18.203 --> 12:19.397
He's not a reliable witness.

12:19.571 --> 12:22.096
What if we take him back
to the crime scene to jog his memory?

12:23.608 --> 12:24.700
I wouldn't recommend that.

12:24.876 --> 12:27.208
There's a strong chance
that if he is re-exposed

12:27.379 --> 12:29.347
it'll trigger a major panic episode.

12:29.548 --> 12:32.312
So we many never know what
happened in that house last night.

12:32.517 --> 12:35.611
This man has no family
and no friends.

12:35.820 --> 12:37.720
The trauma he experienced
while deployed

12:37.889 --> 12:40.687
has driven him
into complete isolation.

12:40.859 --> 12:42.190
Frankly,

12:42.360 --> 12:45.022
forgetting what happened last night
may be the best thing for him.

12:45.230 --> 12:48.199
Has Talbot been taking risperidone
along with benzodiazepines?

12:49.367 --> 12:50.595
As a matter of fact, yes.

12:52.137 --> 12:54.071
I'll talk to him.

12:55.373 --> 12:57.307
I didn't know you had an agent
who was familiar

12:57.475 --> 12:59.602
with the pharmacological
treatment of DSM-IV-TR.

12:59.844 --> 13:01.573
Neither did we.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.907
Thank you for your time, doctor.

13:04.115 --> 13:05.946
No problem.

13:08.853 --> 13:10.150
Who are you?

13:10.355 --> 13:12.915
I'm Kensi. Hi.

13:14.359 --> 13:17.055
Can you tell me about Afghanistan?

13:19.564 --> 13:23.364
Uh, I debriefed tribal leaders.

13:24.603 --> 13:27.595
Men with political power

13:27.806 --> 13:29.899
that were willing to work
with Americans

13:30.075 --> 13:31.872
to stabilize their government.

13:32.611 --> 13:34.670
- That's important work.
- Mm-hm.

13:36.881 --> 13:41.511
I had a unit of Marines assigned
to protect me.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.651
What I knew was so valuable.

13:47.425 --> 13:50.258
- You don't have to say...
- No, that's...

13:52.797 --> 13:54.264
We were ambushed.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.597
It was a kidnap attempt.

13:57.802 --> 14:01.761
The, uh, insurgents,

14:02.774 --> 14:06.540
they, uh, targeted me.

14:07.545 --> 14:10.105
They wanted what was in my head.

14:11.416 --> 14:12.974
Um...

14:15.854 --> 14:19.950
I escaped while those Marines
protected me.

14:20.692 --> 14:23.058
And four of them didn't make it.

14:38.877 --> 14:40.344
Look at me.

14:41.579 --> 14:45.242
I can barely remember them.

14:46.484 --> 14:51.148
Sometimes I see names,
sometimes I see faces

14:51.723 --> 14:54.487
and sometimes I see nothing at all.

14:55.460 --> 14:58.327
If someone were to grab him, they
could force information out of him.

14:58.530 --> 15:01.590
Talbot's a national security breach
waiting to happen.

15:05.336 --> 15:07.463
I know what you're going through.

15:10.408 --> 15:12.876
I have a hard time believing that.

15:35.533 --> 15:38.866
Six years ago,
I was engaged to a Marine.

15:40.371 --> 15:42.896
His name was Jack.

15:44.042 --> 15:46.875
He was stationed in Fallujah.

15:47.045 --> 15:50.071
His unit was tasked
with enforcing curfew.

15:51.082 --> 15:54.518
Shoot-outs and ambushes
every night.

15:57.789 --> 15:59.882
He came back home,

16:02.827 --> 16:04.761
but I knew he wasn't the same.

16:07.332 --> 16:09.732
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

16:11.569 --> 16:13.127
This is news to me.

16:15.173 --> 16:16.663
Me too.

16:18.176 --> 16:22.613
He said life over there was
like falling through the sky.

16:24.916 --> 16:31.321
Constant rush of adrenaline.
Everything felt vivid and real.

16:35.927 --> 16:38.418
And coming home to me...

16:40.698 --> 16:47.160
Coming home to me felt
like hitting the ground.

16:52.877 --> 16:56.108
And I did everything I could.

16:56.948 --> 16:58.472
I...

17:07.959 --> 17:09.983
I worked with his psychiatrist.

17:10.161 --> 17:12.220
I helped with his meds

17:12.396 --> 17:16.299
and I listened,
I always listened, always.

17:20.405 --> 17:22.635
It was Christmas morning...

17:25.376 --> 17:29.870
I woke up and he was gone.

17:32.550 --> 17:34.017
Where did he go?

17:41.326 --> 17:42.384
She's playing him.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.221
She's trying to get him to open up,
right?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.332
Let me take you back to the house.

17:52.036 --> 17:55.369
Being there might help you remember
what happened last night.

17:59.711 --> 18:01.941
You know, your ex was right.

18:03.848 --> 18:07.011
It's exactly
like falling through the sky.

18:10.255 --> 18:14.749
And that's why what
you're suggesting scares me.

18:15.460 --> 18:19.226
I already hit the ground
when I came back from Afghanistan.

18:24.535 --> 18:26.594
What if it happens again?

18:27.305 --> 18:31.674
I will be right there to catch you.

18:39.284 --> 18:40.876
Hey, uh...

18:42.921 --> 18:44.786
You know,
you did all you could to help him.

18:45.556 --> 18:47.820
Wherever Jack is, he knows that.

19:00.571 --> 19:02.801
Wow, and it didn't, um...

19:05.243 --> 19:06.437
Wow.

19:08.579 --> 19:10.012
Go.

19:10.715 --> 19:14.344
Take Deeks with you.
Check in when you get there.

19:30.368 --> 19:33.030
Were you ever, um, tempted
to go looking for him?

19:33.271 --> 19:36.604
Maybe I was hoping one day
he'd come looking for me.

20:00.531 --> 20:02.897
I know this is tough for you.

20:04.869 --> 20:06.894
Uh, I think I'll be okay.

20:07.839 --> 20:09.204
Okay.

20:10.975 --> 20:14.069
Lance, here's something
I don't understand.

20:14.879 --> 20:18.315
Why did Scott
walk all the way over here

20:18.883 --> 20:21.716
to shoot Mancuso
at point-blank range?

20:25.323 --> 20:27.052
Oh, no.

20:35.566 --> 20:38.057
- Are you sure about this?
- Just wait.

20:41.672 --> 20:43.867
I...

20:44.075 --> 20:45.565
I don't know.

20:45.743 --> 20:48.337
There was so much gunshots!
It was a lot of blood!

20:48.946 --> 20:50.277
Please think about this.

20:50.448 --> 20:53.212
It's the only detail
that doesn't make sense to me.

20:55.386 --> 20:57.911
- I can't breathe!
- We have to get him out.

20:58.089 --> 21:01.058
No, wait, wait, wait.

21:02.260 --> 21:05.024
What? What? Tell me.

21:11.335 --> 21:13.326
They didn't kill each other.

21:14.939 --> 21:16.406
I shot them both.

21:37.994 --> 21:40.485
- Where's Talbot right now?
- Boatshed.

21:40.664 --> 21:42.723
We've got two agents
keeping an eye on him.

21:42.899 --> 21:44.298
He says he can't remember anything

21:44.468 --> 21:47.767
other than getting a hold of
Mancuso's gun and pulling the trigger.

21:47.938 --> 21:49.667
Legally speaking, he's not guilty.

21:50.240 --> 21:51.264
He was defending himself.

21:51.441 --> 21:54.001
Forensics show
that Talbot's the victim here.

21:54.177 --> 21:56.805
Sorry to interrupt,
but you'll wanna see this.

21:56.980 --> 22:01.178
This man knows the names of tribal
leaders pivotal to the peace process

22:01.384 --> 22:04.478
and now he's connected
to a double murder.

22:05.088 --> 22:08.683
Go. Brief him now.
I've got calls to make.

22:11.995 --> 22:13.326
So I discovered...

22:14.998 --> 22:18.525
We discovered a connection
between Mancuso and Scott.

22:20.103 --> 22:23.004
L.A.P.D. Found large quantities
of drugs in Scott's car.

22:23.173 --> 22:26.768
Sleeping pills, sedatives, muscle
relaxers and benzodiazepines,

22:26.977 --> 22:28.342
all of which have street value.

22:28.512 --> 22:31.037
And all of which
are used to treat PTSD patients.

22:31.281 --> 22:34.682
Scott's bank accounts
show large cash deposits

22:34.851 --> 22:37.046
that don't match up
with his nurse's salary.

22:37.287 --> 22:38.982
And Talbot's blood test results show

22:39.156 --> 22:41.488
he hasn't been on his medication
for weeks.

22:41.691 --> 22:43.818
What about the patients
under Scott's care?

22:44.027 --> 22:45.688
He was feeding them sugar pills

22:45.862 --> 22:48.695
and selling the actual
pharmaceuticals to John Mancuso.

22:48.932 --> 22:51.492
Fifty-two armed service vets
under that man's care

22:51.668 --> 22:53.465
went months
without proper treatment.

22:53.637 --> 22:56.231
All of this fits our theory. Right?

22:56.439 --> 22:58.134
Mancuso and Scott
had some kind of beef.

22:58.308 --> 23:00.333
The confrontation went down
at Talbot's house.

23:00.544 --> 23:01.636
Guns were drawn.

23:01.811 --> 23:05.542
Talbot must have thought he was back
in Afghanistan and blacked out.

23:05.715 --> 23:09.207
He comes back to his senses,
there's two dead men. He panicked.

23:09.452 --> 23:12.387
So where does this leave the case?

23:13.590 --> 23:16.582
Talbot killed two criminals
in self-defense.

23:16.760 --> 23:19.024
The case is closed.

23:20.363 --> 23:23.161
Deeks, I got it.

23:26.903 --> 23:28.461
Kensi?

23:37.113 --> 23:39.377
I know what you're going through.

23:40.617 --> 23:41.743
I've been there.

23:42.385 --> 23:47.254
I watched Jack slip away.

23:49.759 --> 23:51.727
Maybe I didn't try hard enough.

23:52.362 --> 23:54.523
I don't believe that for one minute.

23:54.931 --> 23:57.593
I know what it's like to have someone
who you care about come back

23:57.801 --> 23:59.928
from deployment a different person.

24:00.870 --> 24:03.737
After all Talbot's been through,

24:03.907 --> 24:07.934
I'm going to do everything
in my power to help him.

24:13.116 --> 24:16.745
Kensi, Talbot's not Jack.

24:19.222 --> 24:23.056
- I was surprised to see you again.
- Why?

24:23.627 --> 24:27.154
You know, back at my house,
there was a moment there

24:27.330 --> 24:31.767
where I almost didn't tell you
what really happened.

24:31.935 --> 24:34.028
You thought you'd go to jail?

24:34.904 --> 24:36.394
No.

24:37.807 --> 24:40.105
I thought you'd give up on me.

24:44.948 --> 24:46.813
You did the right thing.

24:55.292 --> 24:58.318
Wow. Look at that.

24:59.329 --> 25:00.489
You're good.

25:03.300 --> 25:06.827
- The first time my hands...
- Do you have any friends?

25:07.637 --> 25:10.105
Uh... No, not really.

25:10.307 --> 25:12.935
So there's no reason anyone
would be following you?

25:13.710 --> 25:15.371
Following me?

25:16.713 --> 25:18.442
What's going on?

25:18.615 --> 25:22.449
- Please, tell me what's going on.
- Do exactly as I say.

25:22.619 --> 25:26.180
Act like nothing's wrong. Okay?

25:26.356 --> 25:28.881
Stay one step behind me
to my right.

25:32.862 --> 25:36.662
We're approaching a man in a suit,
on our left.

25:36.866 --> 25:38.993
Do you know him?

25:39.169 --> 25:41.797
- No, I've never seen him before.
- Okay.

25:41.971 --> 25:44.997
Oh, man,
I can't believe this is happening.

25:45.208 --> 25:47.233
I need you to stay calm.

25:48.745 --> 25:50.337
Kensi, he's got a gun.

25:53.983 --> 25:55.507
Stay with me! Stay with me!

25:59.856 --> 26:01.824
I'm sure there are two of them.

26:01.991 --> 26:03.720
I didn't see him.

26:05.628 --> 26:07.858
This guy wanted to kill me.

26:08.031 --> 26:09.498
No.

26:09.666 --> 26:11.531
He wanted to kill me.

26:26.949 --> 26:28.109
Thanks.

26:28.283 --> 26:31.047
I'm pretty sure he was with someone.
He's still gotta be out there.

26:32.663 --> 26:34.255
Talbot took a while to calm down.

26:35.591 --> 26:36.615
Eric.

26:36.792 --> 26:39.556
Just pulled the lever
on the facial recognition slot machine

26:39.728 --> 26:42.891
and we've got a winner
on Kensi's cell phone pic.

26:43.098 --> 26:45.896
Behrouz Ghavami,
former member of Takavar.

26:46.101 --> 26:47.159
More specifically,

26:47.369 --> 26:49.496
he was with an urban commando
branch of the Takavar,

26:49.671 --> 26:51.662
Lashgare 23.

26:51.873 --> 26:52.965
Thanks, Eric.

26:53.942 --> 26:56.001
Dead guy's Takavar Lashgare 23.

26:56.244 --> 26:59.008
Iranian Special Military Forces.
Trained to work in pairs.

26:59.181 --> 27:02.173
They want the names of those Afghani
tribal leaders working with our side.

27:03.485 --> 27:06.113
They tried to take me out
so they could grab him.

27:06.321 --> 27:08.380
Just like the kidnap attempt
in Afghanistan.

27:09.091 --> 27:11.025
We need to take him
someplace safe.

27:11.259 --> 27:13.750
In the last 24 hours, Talbot's
shot two guys at his apartment.

27:13.929 --> 27:15.396
Now he's got Iranians chasing him.

27:15.597 --> 27:18.691
It could be a coincidence or a lot more
to this case than we first thought.

27:19.401 --> 27:21.335
Take him to a motel.

27:24.506 --> 27:31.378
If Lashgare 23 is here in Los Angeles,
it's not to sample the Dolmeh Felfel.

27:31.546 --> 27:33.537
Falafel's about as exotic as I get,
Hetty.

27:33.715 --> 27:35.148
That's a pity.

27:35.317 --> 27:37.547
Despite Mr. Talbot's mental state,

27:37.719 --> 27:41.211
they might be able to garner intel
useful to them,

27:41.456 --> 27:43.549
but potentially harmful to us.

27:43.725 --> 27:46.216
I kept watching the footage
from the carollers' video camera,

27:46.428 --> 27:49.864
hoping I'd eventually find something,
which I did.

27:50.065 --> 27:52.033
I like to think of it as Nell's
"Secret Santa."

27:53.001 --> 27:54.559
A black mark.

27:54.736 --> 27:58.137
This is L.A.P.D.'s photos
of the crime scene, same wall.

27:58.340 --> 27:59.864
No mark.

28:00.075 --> 28:02.509
Pull up the photo
of the body positions.

28:05.681 --> 28:08.514
This is where Mancuso fell
after he was shot.

28:09.251 --> 28:12.550
- Head height.
- Coroner confirms his hair was dyed.

28:13.488 --> 28:16.514
- Which explains the mark.
- But not what made it go away.

28:16.725 --> 28:20.092
We need to take a closer look
at Mr. Talbot.

28:20.595 --> 28:22.961
All right, two windows,
a clear view of the parking lot.

28:23.165 --> 28:26.532
Not a single tree, bush or blade
of grass to conceal a foot approach.

28:26.702 --> 28:29.671
It may be functional and dreary
on the outside.

28:29.838 --> 28:34.366
Wait for it.
But once the key has been turned,

28:34.543 --> 28:36.408
a little slice of heaven.

28:42.117 --> 28:46.747
So, uh, kitchenette there,
bathroom right around the corner

28:46.922 --> 28:49.186
and they change these sheets
like clockwork once a week

28:49.357 --> 28:53.191
and free cable except for porn.

28:54.863 --> 28:57.457
It's nice. Classy.

28:57.632 --> 28:59.497
You would know.

29:01.103 --> 29:02.695
So, what do we do now?

29:03.939 --> 29:07.705
Well, uh, we do what most families
do on Christmas Eve.

29:07.876 --> 29:10.037
Watch Uncle Bob get drunk
and pee in the toaster?

29:10.779 --> 29:12.906
How about eat and watch TV?

29:13.081 --> 29:14.810
That's a great idea.
The game just started.

29:15.050 --> 29:20.044
I was thinking more along the lines
of Miracle on 34th Street.

29:20.722 --> 29:21.916
Really?

29:22.090 --> 29:24.149
Actually,
I wouldn't mind watching that.

29:25.293 --> 29:26.317
Really?

29:27.596 --> 29:30.030
Why don't you go get the food,
Deeks?

29:31.767 --> 29:35.168
Yeah, why don't I go get the food

29:35.403 --> 29:37.462
because that's what Deeks does
is get...

29:37.672 --> 29:39.833
Turkey sandwiches
okay for everybody?

29:40.075 --> 29:42.100
The tradition in my house
was ice cream and beer.

29:43.278 --> 29:44.302
Really?

29:44.546 --> 29:46.537
- Don't knock until you've tried it.
- Tried it.

29:46.748 --> 29:49.581
Although it was in seventh grade
and it didn't end pretty for anyone.

29:49.751 --> 29:51.480
Unless of course,
you like Jackson Pollock.

29:51.686 --> 29:54.553
Actually, I love ice cream and beer.

29:58.760 --> 30:00.352
Okay.

30:03.698 --> 30:06.166
Remember Nell mentioned
that Talbot has an ex-wife?

30:06.334 --> 30:08.928
Well, when he was 18,
he married Rochelle Stanton.

30:09.104 --> 30:11.800
A few months into teenage
marital bliss, he calls L.A.P.D.

30:11.973 --> 30:15.170
Reporting she assaulted him.
The marriage was annulled.

30:15.343 --> 30:18.107
Rochelle Stanton scored
on the FBI database hit parade.

30:18.280 --> 30:20.805
She's now married
to one Tagvor Covesian.

30:20.982 --> 30:23.576
Heavy hitter with the Armenian mob
in East Hollywood.

30:23.785 --> 30:26.276
Guess what the bureau's
after him for?

30:26.488 --> 30:29.685
Trafficking in black-market electronics
with Hezbollah.

30:29.891 --> 30:32.018
Iran's biggest terrorist group,
Hezbollah.

30:32.194 --> 30:34.287
They make a fortune
selling counterfeit goods.

30:34.496 --> 30:37.124
We have a possible connection
between Talbot's ex-wife

30:37.299 --> 30:38.630
and the men trying to kidnap him.

30:38.800 --> 30:41.200
Assuming they're working with
Hezbollah not another group.

30:41.403 --> 30:43.064
A friend
of the FBI's surveillance unit

30:43.238 --> 30:46.139
told me that Covesian is hosting
a Christmas Eve football party

30:46.308 --> 30:47.707
for his bookie buddies.

30:47.876 --> 30:49.309
Rochelle Stanton will be there.

30:49.511 --> 30:51.376
We could bring her in
and interrogate her.

30:51.613 --> 30:54.173
She's just gonna lawyer up.
We don't have time for that, Sam.

30:58.153 --> 30:59.415
I count seven.

31:03.658 --> 31:05.649
Definitely packing.

31:09.130 --> 31:11.394
- Eric?
- Just say the word.

31:12.067 --> 31:13.398
We're set.

31:13.568 --> 31:15.399
Okay.

31:15.570 --> 31:16.935
There's the snap.

31:17.172 --> 31:19.367
Quarterback rolls right.

31:19.541 --> 31:21.771
Pump fakes. He has a guy open.

31:22.010 --> 31:24.240
- He throws...
- Now, Eric.

31:26.948 --> 31:28.916
What's going on?

31:29.150 --> 31:31.744
We've definitely got motion
in the backfield.

31:33.388 --> 31:35.356
Call's coming in.

31:36.224 --> 31:37.885
First Class Home
Entertainment Services.

31:38.059 --> 31:40.186
How my I provide you
with excellent service today?

31:40.395 --> 31:42.522
What kind of crap service
am I paying for?

31:42.731 --> 31:45.291
I need somebody out here now!
If someone's here in 5 minutes...

31:47.969 --> 31:51.166
Hurry it up. We missed
the first half of the game already.

31:52.207 --> 31:53.299
I'll check the unit.

31:53.475 --> 31:54.772
Your incoming cable connection?

31:54.943 --> 31:56.808
Back of the house.
My wife can show you.

31:56.978 --> 31:58.707
Move it.

31:59.915 --> 32:01.473
You believe these clowns?

32:01.716 --> 32:04.651
I hope you can get it fixed.
Those guys are pissed.

32:04.819 --> 32:05.877
I'll get right on it.

32:06.621 --> 32:07.815
Why don't you tell me

32:07.989 --> 32:10.890
what your husband's Iranian friends
want with Lance Talbot?

32:12.294 --> 32:14.421
I've got armed agents
all around this house.

32:14.963 --> 32:16.590
Make the wrong decision

32:16.765 --> 32:19.199
a blacked-out game is gonna be
the least of your problems.

32:20.702 --> 32:23.432
Honey? Can I speak to you?

32:23.605 --> 32:25.766
If he's working
with the men trying to kidnap Talbot,

32:25.941 --> 32:28.501
the best thing you can do
is cooperate with us.

32:28.743 --> 32:31.405
- Save yourself the prison sentence.
- What is it?

32:31.579 --> 32:33.774
The appetizers will be ready
in five minutes, baby.

32:34.950 --> 32:36.144
Get back to work.

32:41.523 --> 32:47.223
Tagvor does business with the Iranians
but only on orders from his boss.

32:47.429 --> 32:48.589
He hates them.

32:48.763 --> 32:51.664
His family was exiled
from Tehran in the 1970s.

32:51.833 --> 32:53.266
He won't even meet them in person.

32:53.468 --> 32:56.437
So how the hell would they plot
a kidnapping together?

32:56.604 --> 32:59.198
What was Talbot like
when you knew him?

32:59.374 --> 33:01.672
The son-of-a-bitch
couldn't keep it in his pants.

33:01.843 --> 33:04.641
He had three different girlfriends
on the side for two years

33:04.813 --> 33:06.337
before I found out.

33:06.548 --> 33:09.244
He dropped the assault charges
against you because he felt guilty.

33:09.451 --> 33:12.147
Lance is not capable of feeling guilt.

33:12.320 --> 33:15.847
He was trying to get into the Navy.
Didn't want anything on his record.

33:16.057 --> 33:19.857
Three relationships and he managed
to keep it from you for two years.

33:20.028 --> 33:21.222
He never slipped up?

33:21.396 --> 33:23.261
He remembered birthdays,
phone numbers?

33:23.832 --> 33:26.630
When you're a sociopath
with a photographic memory,

33:26.801 --> 33:28.826
you don't slip up.

33:30.705 --> 33:33.697
Excuse me.
Hey, you check that incoming cable?

33:34.309 --> 33:36.243
Yeah.

33:36.411 --> 33:38.038
Yeah, we're all good here.

33:38.880 --> 33:40.370
Go ahead, Eric.

33:40.782 --> 33:43.216
It's about time!

33:43.785 --> 33:45.377
Good morning, Your Honor.

33:46.855 --> 33:50.416
You do solemnly swear that
the testimony you are about to give...

33:52.060 --> 33:54.893
This better be important.
Kris Kringle is about to go on trial.

33:55.096 --> 33:57.860
There's more to Talbot than we think.
Watch your back.

33:58.800 --> 34:00.597
Yeah.

34:01.302 --> 34:04.294
Oh, my God, really?

34:05.807 --> 34:08.367
Oh, yeah. Right.

34:08.543 --> 34:10.237
Merry Christmas.

34:25.927 --> 34:27.690
Kensi!

34:34.601 --> 34:36.034
Kensi.

34:36.271 --> 34:37.862
Damn it.

34:55.789 --> 35:01.750
I had a dream I was, um, being visited
by the Three Wise Men.

35:02.963 --> 35:06.421
And then I saw Deeks.

35:11.872 --> 35:13.512
- Where's Talbot?
- We're looking for him.

35:13.707 --> 35:15.675
- Are you okay?
- Talk to me, Eric.

35:15.876 --> 35:18.037
L.A.P.D. Reported
a man matching Talbot's description

35:18.212 --> 35:20.578
just carjacked a civilian
two blocks from the motel.

35:20.748 --> 35:21.976
He's in a red Camaro

35:22.249 --> 35:24.547
and I've got traffic cams
on him right now.

35:25.552 --> 35:28.282
Eric's got a visual on Talbot.
Sam and I will go after him.

35:28.455 --> 35:30.423
Stay with Kensi until
the paramedics get here.

35:30.591 --> 35:32.115
- All right.
- Okay, Eric.

35:32.293 --> 35:34.591
- Hurry up, guys, he's moving fast.
- Where is he?

35:34.795 --> 35:36.888
Moving west on Pico,
just past 20th Street.

35:37.064 --> 35:38.326
- Kensi.
- I'm good to go.

35:38.499 --> 35:41.400
I don't think you are and it has nothing
to do with the head wound.

35:42.703 --> 35:45.297
- I'm driving.
- Fine.

35:45.506 --> 35:47.974
Scratch my car,
I'll Bengay your shorts.

35:50.144 --> 35:51.839
He's taking a right on Ocean.

35:52.079 --> 35:53.842
We're on Pico at 7th. Deeks?

35:54.081 --> 35:56.276
On your six, two blocks behind.

35:59.353 --> 36:00.650
Maybe three.

36:04.925 --> 36:07.758
- He's slowing down.
- Santa Monica Pier.

36:31.318 --> 36:32.649
There's the red Camaro.

37:07.788 --> 37:10.052
Got eyes on Talbot.
What's he doing here?

37:10.224 --> 37:11.350
It must be a meet.

37:11.558 --> 37:13.219
Got the right flank.

37:15.796 --> 37:18.162
Let's split up. We'll box him in.

37:20.534 --> 37:22.434
Moving into position.

37:42.523 --> 37:43.683
Talbot just made an exchange.

37:43.857 --> 37:46.223
Took a pack from the other guy
who was at the boardwalk.

37:46.393 --> 37:48.953
He's wearing black pants,
a blue jacket.

37:49.129 --> 37:50.926
Sam,
you and Kensi stay with Talbot.

37:51.131 --> 37:53.190
Deeks and I got the other guy.

37:57.704 --> 37:59.467
He just put a flash drive
in his pocket.

37:59.706 --> 38:02.539
Kensi, stay with him. I'm gonna
loop around and cut him off.

38:02.743 --> 38:04.404
Move in now.

38:28.001 --> 38:29.059
Don't move.

38:29.269 --> 38:30.361
Federal agent.

38:32.606 --> 38:33.800
Honey, come here.

38:36.276 --> 38:37.743
Freeze.

38:44.151 --> 38:46.779
Be careful. Honey, get the kids.

38:47.254 --> 38:49.313
Oh, my God.

39:01.702 --> 39:02.828
You okay?

39:05.906 --> 39:06.964
Yeah.

39:08.976 --> 39:10.034
I'm fine.

39:20.687 --> 39:24.214
You figured it out, didn't you?
How he got it done.

39:24.424 --> 39:26.016
Let's hear it.

39:28.562 --> 39:30.894
Talbot faked his PTSD.

39:31.064 --> 39:34.056
No one would suspect him
of selling classified Intel.

39:34.234 --> 39:36.828
Those angry voicemails
from the nurse on his cell phone?

39:37.037 --> 39:40.336
Scott saw that Talbot's behavior
stayed the same without his meds.

39:40.541 --> 39:43.510
He realized he was faking
and caught onto his plan.

39:43.677 --> 39:46.043
He wanted a cut of Talbot's deal
with the Iranians.

39:46.246 --> 39:49.215
Scott brings in Mancuso as muscle.

39:54.254 --> 39:57.155
Talbot disarms Mancuso
and kills Scott.

39:57.357 --> 40:00.326
He uses Scott's gun
to shoot Mancuso point-blank.

40:03.564 --> 40:06.590
Final touch,
Talbot shoots himself in the hand,

40:06.833 --> 40:08.596
he's covered in his nurse's blood.

40:08.835 --> 40:10.166
He says he's trying to save him.

40:16.777 --> 40:18.404
Throws a wrench in the forensics.

40:18.612 --> 40:20.876
It took 15 minutes for L.A.P.D.
To show up.

40:21.048 --> 40:22.675
Christmas carollers said
it was chaotic.

40:22.849 --> 40:25.579
At some point Talbot slips away,
wipes the black mark off.

40:28.722 --> 40:31.122
That way the crime scene
matches his version of the events.

40:31.358 --> 40:33.189
But when he thought
I was getting suspicious,

40:33.360 --> 40:37.262
he confessed to killing them both,
thinking his PTSD would cover him.

40:38.131 --> 40:39.393
I should have seen through it.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.300
L.A.P.D., the entire U.S. Navy,
his own psychiatrist didn't get it.

40:44.504 --> 40:46.768
What makes you so special?

40:48.709 --> 40:51.234
Picking you up at 11 in the morning.

40:51.411 --> 40:52.901
The game starts at 1.

40:53.080 --> 40:57.107
I'm gonna make sure you still have
those steak knives I gave you last year.

40:57.284 --> 40:59.411
I told you, I still got them.

40:59.586 --> 41:02.214
So it doesn't look like
you're gonna make it to Seattle.

41:02.389 --> 41:04.118
No, Deeks, I'm not going to Seattle.

41:04.291 --> 41:06.418
Since this Christmas Eve
has been so warm and fuzzy,

41:06.593 --> 41:09.061
I say let's keep this party going.

41:09.229 --> 41:11.823
I thought you had a date.

41:12.032 --> 41:13.590
I do.

41:14.167 --> 41:17.796
Marty. It's so nice to see you again.

41:17.971 --> 41:19.802
Who's this pretty young lady friend
of yours?

41:19.973 --> 41:22.271
This is Kensi.
I figured we could use an extra hand.

41:22.442 --> 41:24.603
Thank you, Kensi.
For that you get an apron.

41:24.778 --> 41:27.838
- I get that.
- And you get one too.

41:49.603 --> 41:53.164
Ms. Jones, Merry Christmas.

41:54.107 --> 41:57.941
- Oh. Hetty, you shouldn't have.
- Go ahead.

41:58.145 --> 41:59.772
Open it.

42:02.649 --> 42:06.312
Oh. Well, that's...

42:06.486 --> 42:09.148
- Wow.
- Try it on.

42:10.490 --> 42:13.653
Okay. Okay.

42:15.896 --> 42:17.386
You going home?

42:17.731 --> 42:19.858
Uh, my flight leaves in an hour,

42:20.033 --> 42:22.866
so I'll probably have to go stand-by
on a later one.

42:23.103 --> 42:24.730
Oh, nonsense.

42:24.971 --> 42:25.995
I'll drive you.

42:26.173 --> 42:29.040
- Oh, but it's...
- It's Christmas, Nell.

42:29.209 --> 42:31.609
It's a time for miracles.

42:31.812 --> 42:36.977
And a little talent at the reins
of the sleigh wouldn't hurt either.

42:39.252 --> 42:41.652
Jingle all the way.

42:55.669 --> 42:58.069
Buckle up, my dear.

43:02.876 --> 43:05.106
Hold on, Ms. Jones.

43:05.278 --> 43:07.371
Hetty!
