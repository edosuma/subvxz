- Your principal just called...

00:05.626 --> 00:06.727
- It was Luke!
- It was Zuri!

00:06.751 --> 00:08.209
- It was Ravi!
- It was me!

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
I assume I'm covering for you.

00:13.292 --> 00:15.042
It was all of you.

00:15.083 --> 00:16.167
Apparently you didn't

00:16.168 --> 00:17.250
turn in your money from

00:17.292 --> 00:19.042
- the charity muffin
- sale last month.

00:19.083 --> 00:20.897
The muffins I slaved

00:20.898 --> 00:22.709
over a hot cab ride

00:19.083 --> 00:22.709
to the bakery for!

00:24.375 --> 00:25.480
We didn't turn it in

00:25.481 --> 00:26.584
because...

00:26.918 --> 00:28.042
Because...

00:28.083 --> 00:29.230
Ravi put it in the bank

00:29.231 --> 00:30.375
to earn interest.

00:30.417 --> 00:32.709
I suggested mutual funds,

00:32.710 --> 00:35.000
but no, those are too risky.

00:35.584 --> 00:37.334
- What?
- Okay.

00:37.667 --> 00:38.814
But if you're lying to me,

00:38.815 --> 00:39.959
the next time

00:37.667 --> 00:39.959
you leave your rooms

00:40.000 --> 00:41.188
will be for college.

00:41.189 --> 00:42.375
And wherever you two go.

00:45.334 --> 00:46.584
I am guessing by the

00:46.585 --> 00:47.834
unrepentant fibbery

00:47.876 --> 00:49.084
that none of you

00:49.085 --> 00:50.292
sold your muffins either?

00:50.542 --> 00:52.042
I was going to,

00:52.043 --> 00:53.542
but I couldn't find the right

00:50.542 --> 00:53.542
muffin-selling outfit.

00:53.584 --> 00:55.000
Nothing goes with bran!

00:56.667 --> 00:58.272
And I tried to sell

00:58.273 --> 00:59.876
mine on Butterfly Scout turf.

01:00.083 --> 01:01.230
Those little girls

01:01.231 --> 01:02.375
smashed my muffins

01:02.417 --> 01:03.876
and called me names

01:03.877 --> 01:05.334
that would make

01:02.417 --> 01:05.334
a construction worker blush.

01:07.083 --> 01:08.501
Oh, I just remembered.

01:08.502 --> 01:09.918
Mine are still in my room!

01:11.459 --> 01:13.834
Ta-da! Muffin time!

01:14.417 --> 01:15.876
Luke, those things

01:15.877 --> 01:17.334
are probably hard

01:14.417 --> 01:17.334
as rocks by now.

01:17.375 --> 01:18.564
They're fine.

01:18.565 --> 01:19.751

- looking for an agent to help

- Her find jobs in the business
- you call "show."

give us the money or not?

more per week

than the mayor.

- We get our allowance
- on Sunday.

You know, Mom always

04:47.377 --> 04:48.667
has fundraising parties

04:48.709 --> 04:50.059
- when she needs money
- for her charities.

04:50.083 --> 04:51.584
That's what we should do.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.167
Great idea!

04:53.209 --> 04:54.876
We can charge kids a cover,

04:54.918 --> 04:56.876
- then give all - the proceeds
- To the school.

04:56.918 --> 04:58.667
But if we throw a party here,

04:58.709 --> 05:00.251
then Jessie will know

05:00.252 --> 05:01.792
that we lied right

04:58.709 --> 05:01.792
to her face.

05:01.834 --> 05:04.115
- I got it! We can have it
- at our house in the Hamptons.

05:04.334 --> 05:06.272
Great! But what are we gonna

05:06.273 --> 05:08.209
do about Nanny

05:04.334 --> 05:08.209
McGrounds-A-Lot?

05:09.167 --> 05:10.167
Oh, I wouldn't worry

05:10.168 --> 05:11.168
about Jessie.

05:11.209 --> 05:13.042
- She's been banned
- from the Hamptons

05:13.083 --> 05:14.542
Ever since she

05:14.543 --> 05:16.000
"fell asleep" on

05:13.083 --> 05:16.000
Channing Tatum's front lawn.

05:17.667 --> 05:18.709
Twice.

05:21.959 --> 05:23.876
- Hi, Max?
- Jessie Prescott.

05:23.918 --> 05:26.083
- Uh, a fragile-looking
- Indian boy gave me your card.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.022
What agency

05:30.023 --> 05:31.042
does this guy work

05:29.000 --> 05:31.042
for anyway?

05:31.083 --> 05:32.709
His card says "C.A.E."

05:32.751 --> 05:33.917
Their agents

05:33.918 --> 05:35.083
only represent

05:32.751 --> 05:35.083
the best actors.

05:35.125 --> 05:36.792
- Then what do
- they want with Jessie?

05:37.834 --> 05:40.000
I have absolutely no idea.

05:41.250 --> 05:42.647
Guys, I have a meeting

05:42.648 --> 05:44.042
with an agent!

05:44.083 --> 05:45.709
- And this time,
- he knows about it.

05:49.250 --> 05:50.543
I can't wait

05:50.544 --> 05:51.834
for our Hamptons party!

05:52.083 --> 05:53.792
And I cannot wait to DJ!

05:53.834 --> 05:54.959
I have compiled a list

05:54.960 --> 05:56.083
of the illest party jams

05:56.125 --> 05:57.542
that are sure to

05:57.543 --> 05:58.959
get the house a-rocking.

06:00.292 --> 06:02.209
- Has the Macarena
- hit the States yet?

06:04.209 --> 06:05.543
Guys, did you hear

06:05.544 --> 06:06.876
the horrible news?

06:06.918 --> 06:08.439
Don't worry, we're not gonna

06:08.440 --> 06:09.959
let Ravi play the Macarena.

06:10.375 --> 06:11.729
Or...

06:11.730 --> 06:13.083
"Who Let the Cobras Out"?

06:14.083 --> 06:16.000
It was a huge hit in India!

06:16.042 --> 06:17.521
Based on a very true,

06:17.522 --> 06:19.000
very sad story.

06:20.083 --> 06:21.209
No! Dad just lost

06:21.210 --> 06:22.334
our Hamptons house

06:22.375 --> 06:23.668
to Steven Spielberg

06:23.669 --> 06:24.959
in a game of

06:22.375 --> 06:24.959
rock-paper-scissors.

06:26.083 --> 06:27.563
How many times

06:27.564 --> 06:29.042
have we told him

06:26.083 --> 06:29.042
not to always pick "rock"?

06:29.417 --> 06:31.000
Word gets out!

06:31.792 --> 06:33.064
So, what are we going

06:33.065 --> 06:34.334
to do about raising

06:31.792 --> 06:34.334
that muffin money?

06:34.834 --> 06:35.959
How about we have

06:35.960 --> 06:37.083
an outdoor party?

06:37.125 --> 06:38.268
- We could have it
- on the roof!

06:38.292 --> 06:40.292
- Not now, Luke!
- The smart kids are thinking.

06:42.334 --> 06:43.438
Thank you, Zuri.

06:43.439 --> 06:44.542
Not you.

06:47.375 --> 06:48.522
No, the roof

06:48.523 --> 06:49.667
is a terrible idea.

06:50.125 --> 06:52.250
What if it rains?

06:52.251 --> 06:54.375
Or snows?

06:50.125 --> 06:54.375
Or sharknadoes?

06:56.751 --> 06:57.981
Dodgy attitude,

06:57.982 --> 06:59.209
nervous sweating...

07:00.083 --> 07:01.876
- You're hiding
- something on the roof.

07:01.918 --> 07:03.043
What is it? Candy stash?

07:03.044 --> 07:04.167
Stink bombs?

07:06.167 --> 07:07.417
(COOING)

07:07.459 --> 07:09.167
ALL: Pigeons?

07:11.125 --> 07:12.125
They have been

07:12.126 --> 07:13.126
trained to defend me.

07:13.417 --> 07:15.605
I have a feeling

07:15.606 --> 07:17.792
I might not be popular

07:13.417 --> 07:17.792
in high school.

07:18.459 --> 07:20.376
And you think attack pigeons

07:20.377 --> 07:22.292
are your fast pass out of

07:18.459 --> 07:22.292
Wedgieville?

07:23.959 --> 07:26.000
Actually, the roof is perfect.

07:26.292 --> 07:27.542
All we have to do is

07:27.543 --> 07:28.792
cover up the cage

07:26.292 --> 07:28.792
of flying rats.

07:29.209 --> 07:30.792

07:34.731 --> 07:36.334
what could these

tiny things possibly do...

07:36.375 --> 07:38.250
Ka-kaw!

07:40.876 --> 07:42.250
Hi. Are you Max?

07:42.292 --> 07:43.834
That's me!

Unless you're

07:45.399 --> 07:46.918
a bill collector,

in which case, I'm Tina.

07:49.042 --> 07:50.189
Well,

I'm not a bill collector.

07:49.042 --> 07:51.334
I'm Jessie Prescott,

07:51.375 --> 07:53.209
- and I'm ready
- my screen test.

07:53.250 --> 07:55.000
Great. Let's begin.

07:55.459 --> 07:57.083
Uh. Oh, okay.

07:57.417 --> 07:58.980
(CLEARS THROAT)

07:58.981 --> 08:00.542
Here is a monologue from

07:57.417 --> 08:00.542
my one-woman show,

08:00.584 --> 08:02.292
entitled The Girl Who Was

08:02.293 --> 08:04.000
Too Pretty to Get Asked

08:00.584 --> 08:04.000
to the Dance.

08:06.334 --> 08:08.042
I don't want to hear you talk,

08:08.083 --> 08:09.268
- I just need footage
- of your hands.

08:09.292 --> 08:10.771
And might I say,

08:10.772 --> 08:12.250
they are quite magnificent.

08:15.250 --> 08:16.793
Perfect nail beds,

08:16.794 --> 08:18.334
awesome cuticles...

08:18.375 --> 08:20.042
(GASPS) No knuckle hair.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.404
- Aw... - All right! Back off, Tina!
- I have pepper spray.

08:23.125 --> 08:24.501
Oh, no, no.

08:24.502 --> 08:25.876
I was just looking

08:23.125 --> 08:25.876
at your moneymakers.

08:26.083 --> 08:27.542
What is not clear to you

08:27.543 --> 08:29.000
about the phrase,

08:26.083 --> 08:29.000
"I have pepper spray"?

08:30.584 --> 08:32.042
I thought you were an agent.

08:32.082 --> 08:34.250
I am. For hand models.

08:34.292 --> 08:35.730
You know those commercials

08:35.731 --> 08:37.167
where you see hands

08:34.292 --> 08:37.167
holding something?

08:37.208 --> 08:38.626
I represent the people

08:38.626 --> 08:40.042
attached to those hands.

08:40.082 --> 08:41.188
But your card says

08:41.188 --> 08:42.292
you work at C.A.E.

08:42.958 --> 08:44.480
I do! "Creative

08:44.481 --> 08:46.000
Appendage Employment"!

08:47.083 --> 08:48.563
Oh, you probably

08:48.564 --> 08:50.042
thought it was

08:47.083 --> 08:50.042
the other C.A.E.

08:50.083 --> 08:51.375
Man, I wish!

08:51.417 --> 08:53.338
- Then I wouldn't have
- to work out of the park.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.480
- Sometimes squirrels
- take my lunch.

08:56.542 --> 08:57.876
Listen, Max.

08:57.877 --> 08:59.209
I appreciate your interest,

08:59.250 --> 09:00.647
but I moved to New York

09:00.648 --> 09:02.042
to make my whole body a star.

09:02.417 --> 09:03.709
Uh, you know,

09:03.710 --> 09:05.000
some of these

09:02.417 --> 09:05.000
hand modeling gigs

09:05.042 --> 09:07.000
pay $5,000 each.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.680
- Get these hands a pen!
- Where do I sign?

09:14.959 --> 09:16.143
- JESSIE: Bertram,
- can you help me?

09:16.167 --> 09:17.646
My agent says

09:17.647 --> 09:19.125
I need pictures of my hands

09:16.167 --> 09:19.125
for my portfolio,

09:19.167 --> 09:21.143
- but all I have - is my kindergarten
- Hand turkey.

09:21.167 --> 09:22.605
Which I would really

09:22.606 --> 09:24.042
like to get off

09:21.167 --> 09:24.042
the refrigerator.

09:28.542 --> 09:30.584
You know, Jessie,

09:30.626 --> 09:33.042
glamour shots are so cliche.

09:33.083 --> 09:34.724
- They need to see
- your hands in action.

09:35.334 --> 09:37.250
- No, no, no, don't pose!
- Act natural.

09:38.250 --> 09:39.313
Oh.

09:39.314 --> 09:40.375
Yes! Oh, nice bowl-work.

09:41.083 --> 09:42.209
Yes!

09:42.250 --> 09:43.730
Now get those dirty plates.

09:43.731 --> 09:45.209
Oh! Wonderful!

09:45.250 --> 09:46.268
- Perfect!
- Like this? How's that?

09:46.292 --> 09:47.435
- Yeah! Now put 'em in the sink.
- Okay.

09:47.459 --> 09:49.209
Oh, so natural!

09:49.250 --> 09:50.772
Oh! Now, um, uh,

09:50.773 --> 09:52.292
start wiping down the counter.

09:52.334 --> 09:54.042
- Um, is this,
- is this working for ya?

09:54.083 --> 09:55.459
That is working great!

09:55.500 --> 09:56.772
You gettin' it?

09:56.773 --> 09:58.042
Good! Now, now wipe off

09:55.500 --> 09:58.042
the table.

09:59.083 --> 10:00.584
Yeah, that's it.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.250
Really put your back into it.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.292
Oh, I get it.

10:13.334 --> 10:15.292
- You got a little
- something on your head.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.209
And I'll give you

10:17.210 --> 10:18.334
a hint, it's not hair.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.209
- Okay, so the dance floor
- goes here.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.397
And then the DJ booth

10:25.398 --> 10:26.542
can go right there.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.083
I'm gonna paint it purple.

10:28.125 --> 10:29.375
Hey, kids.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.251
And that, my friends,

10:32.252 --> 10:34.000
is how you divide a decimal.

10:35.542 --> 10:37.272
Guess what?

10:37.273 --> 10:39.000
Actually, don't, don't guess.

10:35.542 --> 10:39.000
It's always insulting.

10:40.542 --> 10:42.501
Anyway, my new agent

10:42.502 --> 10:44.459
just got me a job

10:40.542 --> 10:44.459
on a late-night infomercial!

10:44.500 --> 10:46.042
Nice, Jessie! Up top!

10:46.083 --> 10:48.042
- Wha... (SCREAMS)
- N... Not the hands! Ow!

10:48.584 --> 10:50.042
Hey! Add my hands to the list

10:50.043 --> 10:51.500
of things you cannot touch.

10:57.667 --> 10:58.855
Hey!

10:58.856 --> 11:00.042
If she's gone

10:57.667 --> 11:00.042
tomorrow night,

11:00.083 --> 11:01.602
- that's when
- we should have the party.

11:01.626 --> 11:02.626
You're right!

11:02.627 --> 11:03.626
Quick, everyone text

11:01.626 --> 11:03.626
all of your friends.

11:05.292 --> 11:06.125
(BEEPS)

11:06.167 --> 11:07.167
(DINGS)

11:08.209 --> 11:09.272
Ravi, I already know

11:09.273 --> 11:10.334
about the party.

11:12.125 --> 11:14.209
Oh. Then I am done.

11:17.751 --> 11:19.471
- Guys, want to come
- to a commercial shoot

11:19.500 --> 11:21.375
- And see these
- bad boys in action?

11:21.417 --> 11:22.500
- Nope.
- Uh-uh.

11:22.542 --> 11:24.000
- Meh.
- Pass.

11:25.083 --> 11:26.876
Fine. See if I ever go to one

11:26.877 --> 11:28.667
of your "talent" shows again.

11:33.584 --> 11:34.814
Jessie,

11:34.815 --> 11:36.042
this warm wax treatment

11:36.083 --> 11:37.897
will take you on

11:37.898 --> 11:39.709
a jasmine-scented journey

11:36.083 --> 11:39.709
of relaxation.

11:39.751 --> 11:41.000
JESSIE: Mmm.

11:44.584 --> 11:46.500
That'd be nice.

11:46.542 --> 11:47.772
The last journey my hands

11:47.773 --> 11:49.000
took was into the toilet

11:46.542 --> 11:49.000
to fish out Zuri's cell phone.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.667
- Why can't she ever
- drop it before she goes?

11:53.334 --> 11:55.481
I will now make you

11:55.482 --> 11:57.626
my special brand

11:53.334 --> 11:57.626
of stress-reducing tea

11:58.083 --> 12:00.042
while your eyes

12:00.043 --> 12:02.000
are covered and you

11:58.083 --> 12:02.000
cannot see anything.

12:04.167 --> 12:05.689
Uh, so if you hear

12:05.690 --> 12:07.209
a bunch of noise

12:04.167 --> 12:07.209
and shuffling behind you,

12:07.250 --> 12:08.709
that is what it is.

12:09.083 --> 12:10.147
All part of the vigorous

12:10.148 --> 12:11.209
tea-making process.

12:12.083 --> 12:13.292
Nothing more.

12:13.293 --> 12:14.500
And when you hear the ding,

12:14.542 --> 12:16.500
dip your hands into the wax.

12:17.167 --> 12:19.042
(DINGING)

12:25.209 --> 12:26.250
(SIGHS)

12:26.292 --> 12:27.939
See? Does that not feel...

12:27.940 --> 12:29.584
Dear Gods!

12:31.542 --> 12:33.382
- Nanny mode activated!
- What's the emergency?

12:33.417 --> 12:35.125
- Code red?
- Code blue?

12:36.083 --> 12:37.083
Code purple?

12:37.084 --> 12:38.084
Code purple!

12:40.709 --> 12:42.125
Are things not dire enough

12:42.167 --> 12:43.501
without you

12:43.502 --> 12:44.834
introducing a new code?

12:46.834 --> 12:48.793
It's not coming off!

12:48.794 --> 12:50.751
The commercial shoot

12:46.834 --> 12:50.751
is in two hours!

12:51.083 --> 12:53.042
If it is any consolation,

12:53.083 --> 12:54.688
the color of that hand

12:54.689 --> 12:56.292
really makes your eyes pop!

12:57.417 --> 12:59.185
- I'd throttle you,
- but the purple fingerprints

12:59.209 --> 13:00.609
- Would lead the cops
- right to me!

13:02.000 --> 13:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:11.125 --> 13:12.167
You're late.

13:12.209 --> 13:13.751
Yeah.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.292
We have a little problem. I...

13:15.334 --> 13:16.852
- Just don't make
- a big deal out of it.

13:16.876 --> 13:18.501
Jessie, I've been in the hand

13:18.502 --> 13:20.125
game a long time now,

13:20.167 --> 13:21.876
- and I've seen it all...
- (SCREAMING)

13:24.083 --> 13:25.105
Except that!

13:25.106 --> 13:26.125
Way to play it cool.

13:26.375 --> 13:28.042
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

13:28.083 --> 13:29.500
You are gonna get us fired!

13:29.542 --> 13:31.125
- And if I don't pay rent
- this month,

13:31.167 --> 13:32.167
My mom's totally

13:32.168 --> 13:33.167
gonna kick me out

13:31.167 --> 13:33.167
of her basement!

13:33.876 --> 13:35.814
Oh, that explains

13:35.815 --> 13:37.751
why you smell like mildew

13:33.876 --> 13:37.751
and old couch.

13:42.792 --> 13:43.792
I can't believe

13:43.793 --> 13:44.793
no one came to our party.

13:44.834 --> 13:46.794
- We're never gonna
- make back that muffin money.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.584
Looking back, perhaps

13:48.585 --> 13:50.167
we should not have charged

13:47.000 --> 13:50.167
50 bucks a ticket.

13:51.209 --> 13:52.251
May be people

13:52.252 --> 13:53.292
are just fashionably late.

13:53.667 --> 13:54.875
We passed fashionably

13:54.876 --> 13:56.083
late an hour ago.

13:56.334 --> 13:58.334
Now it is personal.

13:59.125 --> 14:00.313
I can't have Jessie

14:00.314 --> 14:01.500
punish me again.

14:01.542 --> 14:03.417
- I've been grounded
- so many times,

14:03.459 --> 14:04.835
The last video game

14:04.836 --> 14:06.209
I played was Grand Theft

14:03.459 --> 14:06.209
Covered Wagon.

14:11.542 --> 14:12.834
Thank goodness!

14:13.250 --> 14:14.647
My party record remains

14:14.648 --> 14:16.042
as unblemished as my face.

14:17.792 --> 14:19.334
Yeah, thanks to me.

14:19.709 --> 14:21.209
People are only

14:21.210 --> 14:22.709
here because I posted online

14:22.751 --> 14:25.314
that Chase Logan is taking

14:25.315 --> 14:27.876
time off from his world tour

14:22.751 --> 14:27.876
to come to our party.

14:28.250 --> 14:29.355
He is?

14:29.356 --> 14:30.459
How do I look?

14:32.250 --> 14:34.125
- As gullible
- as the rest of these suckers.

14:34.834 --> 14:36.542
'Cause he's not coming.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.084
Uh, Zuri, don't you think

14:38.085 --> 14:39.584
people are going to be

14:36.584 --> 14:39.584
really mad

14:39.626 --> 14:40.813
when they find out

14:40.814 --> 14:42.000
they've been lied to?

14:42.042 --> 14:43.646
Hey, I just handle

14:43.647 --> 14:45.250
promotions.

14:45.292 --> 14:46.606
This is now officially

14:46.607 --> 14:47.918
a dumb kids' problem.

14:51.834 --> 14:53.542
- Ow, ow, ow!
- I think I can see bone!

14:57.584 --> 14:59.167
Can't we just reschedule?

14:59.209 --> 15:01.042
Oh, brilliant idea.

15:01.083 --> 15:02.292
Delaying production

15:02.293 --> 15:03.500
will only cost

15:01.083 --> 15:03.500
an extra $50,000!

15:04.000 --> 15:05.320
- Great. So, like,
- Tuesday then?

15:06.250 --> 15:08.411
- You'll just have - to hide it from them.
- Hide what?

15:08.459 --> 15:10.001
Uh...

15:10.002 --> 15:11.542
My enthusiasm for this job!

15:11.584 --> 15:13.334
- Can't wait
- to get started, sir!

15:14.709 --> 15:15.960
Just hold up the product,

15:15.961 --> 15:17.209
watch your shadows,

15:17.250 --> 15:18.792
- and try not
- to get cut or burned.

15:18.834 --> 15:19.915
- Uh, wait.
- Say what, now?

15:20.417 --> 15:21.626
Okay, bring

15:21.627 --> 15:22.834
in the Kitchen Dragon!

15:25.250 --> 15:26.292
No, no, no...

15:30.000 --> 15:31.084
O-M-G!

15:31.085 --> 15:32.167
I could lose a finger!

15:32.417 --> 15:33.605
If you do,

15:33.606 --> 15:34.792
try and make it the pinkie.

15:35.083 --> 15:36.375
It's not your best finger.

15:37.834 --> 15:38.939
You know, I'm beginning

15:38.940 --> 15:40.042
to see why you

15:37.834 --> 15:40.042
can't afford an office.

15:40.083 --> 15:41.188
Or an apartment.

15:41.189 --> 15:42.292
Or a belt.

15:47.250 --> 15:49.085
Wow, people are ticked off

15:49.086 --> 15:50.918
that Chase Logan's not here.

15:51.167 --> 15:52.584
I'm glad I sent that e-mail

15:52.585 --> 15:54.000
blast from Ravi's account.

15:55.334 --> 15:56.918
What are we gonna do?

15:57.626 --> 15:58.813
Why don't we just throw

15:58.814 --> 16:00.000
Emma's Chase Logan hat

15:57.626 --> 16:00.000
on that mop?

16:00.042 --> 16:01.602
- They have
- the same amount of talent.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.397
(GASPS) I just had

16:05.398 --> 16:07.292
the most brilliant idea!

16:07.334 --> 16:08.355
Whatever it is,

16:08.356 --> 16:09.375
leave me out of it.

16:10.334 --> 16:11.876
And I'm in it.

Hey, hey, hey!

Keep your oily, teenage

16:15.626 --> 16:18.792
hands off of Mr. Logan!

16:19.959 --> 16:21.064
I get 10 percent

16:21.065 --> 16:22.167
of the take,

16:22.209 --> 16:23.688
or I let these girls

16:23.689 --> 16:25.167
rip your lips off

16:22.209 --> 16:25.167
and keep 'em as souvenirs.

16:30.231 --> 16:31.375
using the Kitchen Dragon.

16:29.083 --> 16:31.375
Got it?

16:31.417 --> 16:32.793
I can also add

16:32.794 --> 16:34.167
some of my own stuff.

16:31.417 --> 16:34.167
Improv a little.

16:35.334 --> 16:37.292

17:22.291 --> 17:24.271
Because it's so easy to use,

17:24.271 --> 17:26.250
I only need one!

Oh, uh... Oh, but, uh,

18:22.919 --> 18:24.751
we're still gonna

18:21.083 --> 18:24.751
get paid, right?

18:25.083 --> 18:26.751
- Please?
- If I don't give my mom

Some cash, then

she's gonna give the

basement back to the dog.

18:33.042 --> 18:35.042
Is this a bad time to ask you

18:35.083 --> 18:37.364
- if you can reimburse me
- for the manicure I had to get?

18:38.959 --> 18:40.680
- Can I at least
- have one of those steaks?

Jessie! Amazing news!

18:47.709 --> 18:49.250
The clients aren't happy

18:49.292 --> 18:50.585
you pointed out some

18:50.586 --> 18:51.876
fatal design flaws

18:49.292 --> 18:51.876
in their product,

18:51.918 --> 18:53.147
but they think

18:53.148 --> 18:54.375
you're really pretty.

18:54.417 --> 18:56.643
- And they want you - to star in

Yes! As long as you

19:02.356 --> 19:03.834
don't stick it in

19:00.876 --> 19:03.834
a bucket of paint.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.667
I can't make any promises.

19:18.564 --> 19:20.042
that he's on every talk show,

- shot a documentary
- about himself,

19:21.667 --> 19:22.814

Okay, this is

what we have

20:12.083 --> 20:14.792
been training for:

of the establishment!

20:46.167 --> 20:48.000
Ravi, you saved us!

Well done,

20:50.543 --> 20:52.000
Bradley Pooper and

20:49.083 --> 20:52.000
James Vanderbeak.

20:53.751 --> 20:54.897
Well, I'd say our party

20:54.898 --> 20:56.042
was a big success.

20:56.083 --> 20:57.083
We made a ton of money

20:57.084 --> 20:58.084
and we got out clean.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.626
I'm gonna need a word

21:00.627 --> 21:02.167
with Bradley Pooper.

21:07.083 --> 21:08.083
So, according

21:08.084 --> 21:09.084
to Mrs. Chesterfield,

21:09.125 --> 21:10.563
you had a pigeon

21:10.564 --> 21:12.000
poop party on the roof?

21:13.125 --> 21:14.334
To be fair,

21:14.335 --> 21:15.542
that was not

21:13.125 --> 21:15.542
our original theme.

21:17.083 --> 21:19.042
- The truth is,
- none of us sold our muffins,

21:19.083 --> 21:20.918
- So we threw a party
- to raise the money!

21:21.125 --> 21:22.147
What? So you did lie

21:22.148 --> 21:23.167
about the muffins!

21:23.667 --> 21:25.792
She didn't know about that!

21:25.834 --> 21:27.500
Way to go, blabbermouth.

21:30.083 --> 21:31.938
Forgive me.

21:31.939 --> 21:33.792
My mouth is as incontinent

21:30.083 --> 21:33.792
as my pigeons.

21:34.209 --> 21:35.918
Okay, that's it!

21:35.959 --> 21:37.397
No more TV or Internet

21:37.398 --> 21:38.834
for the rest of your lives.

21:39.125 --> 21:40.563
And your grandkids

21:40.564 --> 21:42.000
have lost their

21:39.125 --> 21:42.000
jetpack privileges!

21:43.083 --> 21:44.563
Yours, too.

21:44.564 --> 21:46.042
(HUFFS) Yeah,

21:43.083 --> 21:46.042
like I'm gonna have kids!

21:47.125 --> 21:49.042
- Well, what
- you're all going to do

21:49.083 --> 21:50.667
- Is go up
- and clean that roof.

21:50.709 --> 21:52.042
You can't make us!

21:52.083 --> 21:53.751
Oh, yeah?

21:54.083 --> 21:55.083
I got a Kitchen Dragon

21:55.084 --> 21:56.083
here and I'm not

21:54.083 --> 21:56.083
afraid to use it.

21:56.125 --> 21:58.046
- Okay, okay! - We're cleaning,
- We're cleaning!

22:01.083 --> 22:02.167
(LAUGHING)

22:02.209 --> 22:04.000
- It is the only appliance
- I'll ever need.

22:08.792 --> 22:10.251
So, just sign here,

22:10.252 --> 22:11.709
and your Kitchen Dragon

22:08.792 --> 22:11.709
contracts will be official.

22:12.167 --> 22:14.083
- Make sure you read
- the fine print.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.563
This butler gig

22:15.564 --> 22:17.000
was only supposed

22:14.125 --> 22:17.000
to be a summer job.

22:20.751 --> 22:23.000
So I guess this is it, huh?

22:24.042 --> 22:25.563
Now that you're big-time,

22:25.564 --> 22:27.083
you'll probably need

22:24.042 --> 22:27.083
a whole-body agent.

22:28.918 --> 22:30.125
I'm gonna miss you.

22:30.167 --> 22:31.918
- You were the best client
- I ever had.

22:31.959 --> 22:33.083
I only had one job.

22:33.125 --> 22:35.000
- That's one more
- than my other clients have!

22:36.125 --> 22:37.668
The truth is,

22:37.669 --> 22:39.209
I'm not a very good agent.

22:39.876 --> 22:41.636
- At least that's
- what my mom keeps saying.

22:42.334 --> 22:44.543
Wait! Max,

22:44.544 --> 22:46.751
you're a great agent.

22:47.167 --> 22:49.042
- You believed in me
- when no one else did.

22:49.083 --> 22:51.167
And she means no one else.

22:51.209 --> 22:53.042
Nobody. Zilch.

22:53.083 --> 22:54.083
Zero-point-zero people.

22:54.084 --> 22:55.084
Yeah, we get it!

22:58.083 --> 23:00.251
Look, you got me

23:00.252 --> 23:02.417
my first commercial,

22:58.083 --> 23:02.417
you fought for me.

23:03.083 --> 23:05.000
- So if you want
- to represent me,

23:05.042 --> 23:06.542
From head to toe,

23:06.543 --> 23:08.042
I would love for you

23:05.042 --> 23:08.042
to be my agent.

23:08.083 --> 23:09.042
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.959
- That's awesome!
- Okay! All right.

23:12.292 --> 23:14.143
- Oh! You guys wouldn't
- happen to have an unused

23:14.167 --> 23:16.042
- Office-shaped
- room available...

23:16.083 --> 23:18.042
No! No more people!

23:18.876 --> 23:20.042
That finger!

23:20.083 --> 23:21.751
It's so commanding!

23:21.792 --> 23:22.876
Shave that knuckle hair

23:22.877 --> 23:23.959
and I can make

23:21.792 --> 23:23.959
you a star, kid!

23:24.209 --> 23:25.772
Really? You mean

23:25.773 --> 23:27.334
I'd never have to wash

23:24.209 --> 23:27.334
another dish?

23:28.083 --> 23:29.167
You don't wash 'em now.
