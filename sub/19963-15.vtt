00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:03.871 --> 00:04.937
(theme song playing)

00:09.110 --> 00:12.378
<i> ¶ I got the wind in my hair</i>
<i> and a fire within ¶</i>

00:12.380 --> 00:14.480
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's</i>
<i> something beginning ¶</i>

00:14.482 --> 00:20.185
<i> ¶ I got a mystery to solve</i>
<i> and excitement to spare ¶</i>

00:20.187 --> 00:23.355
<i> ¶ That beautiful breeze</i>
<i> blowing through ¶</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:28.193
<i> ¶ I'm ready to follow it</i>
<i> who knows where ¶</i>

00:28.195 --> 00:30.896
<i> ¶ I'll get there, I swear ¶</i>

00:43.010 --> 00:44.643
(buoys ringing)

00:50.818 --> 00:52.217
Man:
You're late!

00:52.219 --> 00:54.353
Did you find it?

00:54.355 --> 00:56.221
Remember, lass,

00:56.223 --> 00:58.390
abide the warnings.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.025
Yeah. Warnings.
Totally got it.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.227
Pay heed!

01:02.229 --> 01:05.230
For once you open this box,

01:05.232 --> 01:07.933
your life will never
be the same.

01:07.935 --> 01:10.169
Sure thing.
It's not for me though.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.906
It's for someone very special.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.742
Rapunzel:
Happy birthday, Mom.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.246
Oh! A telescope.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.916
Yeah! We can use it
to watch all the falling stars

01:23.918 --> 01:26.118
during the
Empyrean Shower tonight!

01:26.120 --> 01:28.754
(gasps)
Oh, such a good idea, dear!

01:28.756 --> 01:31.557
-Thank you.
-(laughing)
Open mine next, Mrs. Queen.

01:31.559 --> 01:34.026
Lance, you didn't
need to get me a...

01:34.028 --> 01:35.461
(fly buzzing)

01:35.463 --> 01:37.396
tent.

01:37.398 --> 01:38.630
Thank you so much.

01:38.632 --> 01:39.698
It's for camping!

01:39.700 --> 01:41.200
Queens go camping, right?

01:41.202 --> 01:42.434
Uh, not usually.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.403
Huh. (gasps) Hey!

01:44.405 --> 01:45.804
Speaking of camping,

01:45.806 --> 01:48.273
Eugene and I
are making a whole night

01:48.275 --> 01:49.441
out of watching the shower.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.376
We're actually gonna
camp out overnight.

01:51.378 --> 01:53.112
It's kind of a tradition.

01:53.114 --> 01:54.379
Hey!

01:54.381 --> 01:55.914
Think I can borrow
your tent?

01:55.916 --> 01:57.483
Ahem! Lance!

01:57.485 --> 01:58.884
It's time we had
a little discussion

01:58.886 --> 02:01.453
about royal appropriate
conversation!

02:01.455 --> 02:03.622
And I better pack
for our big night

02:03.624 --> 02:05.390
at Mount Saison,
right, Mom?

02:05.392 --> 02:06.391
Come on, Pascal.

02:08.996 --> 02:11.163
She's certainly excited
for your trip.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.464
Not as much as I am.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.433
My first birthday with Rapunzel,

02:14.435 --> 02:16.168
and it just happens to coincide

02:16.170 --> 02:19.238
with a star shower
that only comes once
every nine years?

02:19.240 --> 02:20.472
It's too perfect.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.408
But mostly, this is
our first trip together.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.811
Everything's been so hectic
since she's come back,

02:25.813 --> 02:29.748
and I'm looking forward
to some nice, quiet
mother/daughter time.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.618
Willow (loudly):
Where's the birthday girl?!

02:32.620 --> 02:34.686
(laughing)

02:34.688 --> 02:36.121
(sighs)

02:36.123 --> 02:37.422
Nigel!

02:37.424 --> 02:40.025
Looking good as always.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.293
See, Stan?

02:41.295 --> 02:44.363
I told you a mustache
would look killer on you.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.265
(squeals)
Freidborg!

02:46.267 --> 02:48.934
Radiant as always.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.602
I hope you haven't
been boring everyone

02:50.604 --> 02:52.704
with those crazy stories
about all the trouble

02:52.706 --> 02:54.173
you and me used to get into!

02:54.175 --> 02:57.442
(laughs, sighs)
She's such a chatterbox.

02:57.444 --> 02:58.544
(squeals happily)

02:58.546 --> 03:00.546
There's my older sister.

03:00.548 --> 03:04.383
(groaning)
Oh, Willow, I had no idea
you were coming.

03:04.385 --> 03:05.984
And miss your birthday?

03:05.986 --> 03:07.553
Well, you have missed
the last six,

03:07.555 --> 03:08.487
but who's counting?

03:08.489 --> 03:10.355
Huh? Has it really
been that many?

03:10.357 --> 03:11.890
Big Fred!

03:13.127 --> 03:16.128
You always gave
the best bear hugs.

03:16.130 --> 03:18.063
Willow! (chuckles)

03:18.065 --> 03:20.165
King Frederic:
What a delightful surprise.

03:20.167 --> 03:23.802
Uh, Your Majesty.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.170
W-what gives?

03:25.172 --> 03:26.805
It's the queen's birthday.

03:26.807 --> 03:29.641
Willow:
These folks should have
the day off to celebrate.

03:29.643 --> 03:33.579
I suppose there is
cause to roister.

03:33.581 --> 03:34.713
(whispers):
Really, Fred.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.548
There's no need to shut
the whole kingdom down.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.050
Did you hear
that everyone?

03:38.052 --> 03:41.420
Willow:
You get the rest
of the day off!

03:41.422 --> 03:43.088
(cheering)

03:43.090 --> 03:44.890
Ari.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.159
I got you something
very special.

03:47.161 --> 03:49.494
Oh, Wilhelmina,

03:49.496 --> 03:50.829
you shouldn't have--

03:50.831 --> 03:53.065
-(exclaims)
-(trills)

03:53.067 --> 03:54.533
Uh, it's, uh...

03:54.535 --> 03:56.768
It's an UUmlaut.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.537
And she's extremely rare.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.439
I found her
on my travels

04:00.441 --> 04:02.407
through the
Neserdnian Empire.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.443
(ringing)

04:05.379 --> 04:07.346
-And what's this?
-Her rattle.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.580
Oh, the guy
who sold it to me

04:08.582 --> 04:10.449
said to make sure that
she has it on her at all times.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.451
I don't know.
Must be a comfort thing.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.019
(cooing)

04:14.021 --> 04:15.921
-Well, this is very--
-(splat)

04:15.923 --> 04:17.856
Oh! Thoughtful.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.525
Now, where's
my long lost niece?

04:20.527 --> 04:23.028
You never wear shoes either?

04:23.030 --> 04:24.429
I've always said,

04:24.431 --> 04:25.931
how can you know
where you stand in the world

04:25.933 --> 04:28.433
if you can't feel the ground
beneath your feet?

04:28.435 --> 04:30.569
-Oh, my.
-(Pascal chirps)

04:30.571 --> 04:32.237
Willow:
'Punzel.

04:32.239 --> 04:35.307
These are ah-mazing!

04:35.309 --> 04:37.643
Aw, thanks, Aunt Willow.

04:37.645 --> 04:40.412
Yes. Rapunzel is
quite the artist.

04:40.414 --> 04:41.880
Well, obviously, Ari.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.783
I mean, this one says so much.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.285
(Pascal chitters)

04:46.287 --> 04:47.886
Sometimes, when I paint,

04:47.888 --> 04:50.222
I tell myself
I'm not painting a picture,

04:50.224 --> 04:52.624
-I am painting a story.
-Painting a story.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.159
-(gasps) Oh my gosh!
-Right?!

04:54.161 --> 04:56.295
-Yes!
-I paint too!

04:56.297 --> 04:58.263
-Well, that's funny.
-You do?

04:58.265 --> 05:00.465
-You two have so much in...
-You know what my
favorite thing to paint is?

05:00.467 --> 05:02.234
Rapunzel:
If you say "dreams"
right now...

05:02.236 --> 05:04.303
Willow:
I was totally
gonna say dreams!

05:04.305 --> 05:06.305
(ringing)

05:06.307 --> 05:08.307
I'm not angry.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.576
I'm irritated.

05:11.578 --> 05:12.644
I love Willow.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.346
She's fun, she's silly.

05:14.348 --> 05:15.781
She's really outgoing.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.849
But she can also be loud,

05:17.851 --> 05:19.184
inconsiderate,

05:19.186 --> 05:20.619
and a little--

05:20.621 --> 05:22.688
-(loud squeaking)
-(exclaims)

05:22.690 --> 05:24.289
(trills)

05:24.291 --> 05:25.524
(cooing)

05:25.526 --> 05:29.094
-Obnoxious.
-(trilling)

05:29.096 --> 05:31.863
I just wish I knew
she was coming.

05:31.865 --> 05:35.000
I-I could have
mentally prepared.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.669
At least I'll get a little
break from her tonight.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.339
Willow will just have
to understand

05:40.341 --> 05:42.541
that Rapunzel and I
made these plans

05:42.543 --> 05:47.012
to watch the Empyrean Shower
together a long time ago.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.547
(trills)

05:50.217 --> 05:53.118
Besides, she won't even
know we're going, unless--

05:53.120 --> 05:54.720
Mom!

05:54.722 --> 05:57.556
Guess who wants to come
to Mount Saison with us?

06:00.127 --> 06:01.727
(ringing)

06:04.865 --> 06:07.032
(birds chirping)

06:11.171 --> 06:12.637
So, the best place
to see the shower

06:12.639 --> 06:15.040
is the southern ridge
at the peak of Mount Saison.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.875
Then the southern ridge it is!

06:16.877 --> 06:19.544
-(cooing)
-Who's a good UUmlaut?

06:19.546 --> 06:22.414
Who's a good UUmlaut?
You are!

06:22.416 --> 06:24.216
-Willow: Yes, you are.
-I thought we'd take this trail.

06:24.218 --> 06:27.552
Rapunzel, oh my goodness,
the view is breathtaking!

06:27.554 --> 06:28.987
Who's fancy?

06:28.989 --> 06:30.589
You're so fancy.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.691
-Now, I timed it out,
so we should...
-I love you!

06:32.693 --> 06:35.861
-Yes, I do!
-...get there just before
the shower begins.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.996
(baby talk)

06:37.998 --> 06:40.132
(irritated):
Willow!

06:41.735 --> 06:43.668
-Are you ready to go?
-Always.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.937
Uh, Ari, look who
you left behind.

06:45.939 --> 06:49.775
-Our little
UUmmy-wuumy peanut!
-(trills)

06:49.777 --> 06:51.443
(ringing)

06:51.445 --> 06:53.078
Thank you, Willow.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.613
I almost forgot.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.747
Oh, my gosh!

06:55.749 --> 06:58.517
I didn't realize
we were so close!

06:58.519 --> 07:02.187
-To where?
-One of my favorite
places in the world!

07:04.258 --> 07:06.625
-(ringing)
-(growls)

07:09.596 --> 07:11.263
(sighs)

07:13.967 --> 07:17.769
Pascal, you're gonna love
this camping trip with the guys!

07:17.771 --> 07:20.238
Yep! It's gonna be
just like old times.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.407
Out in the woods.
No need to worry about rules,

07:22.409 --> 07:24.309
or manners, or anything!

07:24.311 --> 07:26.645
I'm sorry, were those
concerns of yours before?

07:26.647 --> 07:28.246
(chuckling)

07:28.248 --> 07:29.781
Oh! Your Majesty.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.616
Ah! Uh, hello, Your Majesty.

07:31.618 --> 07:35.120
Ah, getting ready
for the big trip, I see.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.622
Yeah! Seeing the
Empyrean Showers.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.090
It's just this little
thing we do.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.625
Little thing?!

07:40.627 --> 07:43.795
It marks the first job
we ever pulled as kids,
your majestic one.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.164
You know how easy it is
to pick someone's pocket

07:46.166 --> 07:48.166
when their eyes
are on the sky?

07:48.168 --> 07:49.801
Lance!

07:49.803 --> 07:53.805
Remember our discussion
about king appropriate stories?

07:53.807 --> 07:56.141
-(Pascal squeaking)
-Looks like fun.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.109
A lot of fun.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.679
Yep. (sighs)

08:00.681 --> 08:02.914
Everyone's having fun.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.983
Hey! How 'bout you
come with us?

08:05.919 --> 08:07.185
What? Me?

08:07.187 --> 08:08.453
No, no, no, no.

08:08.455 --> 08:11.022
I mean, well, sure,
I could use the fresh air.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.824
I'll get my things.

08:12.826 --> 08:13.658
What?

08:13.660 --> 08:14.926
I thought you liked the king.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.329
Oh, I love the king, Lance,
but he's the king.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.130
And if I'm lucky,
my future father-in-law,

08:19.132 --> 08:21.633
so if he's coming with us,
we have to be on
our best behavior.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.001
And by "we," I mean "you."

08:23.003 --> 08:25.170
And by "our best behavior,"
I mean "your best behavior,"

08:25.172 --> 08:27.939
because you cannot
be a total slob
in front of the king!

08:27.941 --> 08:30.208
-Relax, buddy.
-(glass shatters)

08:30.210 --> 08:31.877
King or no king,

08:31.879 --> 08:33.845
it'll just be a bunch
of guys camping,

08:33.847 --> 08:35.480
but if it makes
you feel better,

08:35.482 --> 08:37.182
I'll be a paragon of eti--

08:37.184 --> 08:38.483
(belches)

08:38.485 --> 08:40.552
-...quette.
-I'm sure you will.

08:40.554 --> 08:44.723
Willow:
So, I looked at Arianna,
and said to the guy,

08:44.725 --> 08:46.725
"You keep the monkey.

08:46.727 --> 08:47.959
I'll keep the fez."

08:47.961 --> 08:50.529
(laughter)

08:50.531 --> 08:52.130
But the most
ridiculous thing

08:52.132 --> 08:53.632
that ever happened
to Ari and me?

08:53.634 --> 08:56.034
Ooh! "Ari!"

08:56.036 --> 08:58.870
When we were kids,
I had this idea for this giant

08:58.872 --> 09:01.573
cape slash kite,
I could use to fly.

09:01.575 --> 09:04.142
Oh, Willow! We should
probably be on our way.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.845
I was 98% sure
it was gonna work.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.514
Uh, what about
the other four percent?

09:09.516 --> 09:12.050
That's what big sisters
are for. Am I right?

09:12.052 --> 09:14.653
Back then, (chuckles)

09:14.655 --> 09:16.922
I called her "Dare-ianna."

09:16.924 --> 09:19.057
Because she was
so eager to impress,

09:19.059 --> 09:21.693
she'd do anything I dared.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.261
Long story, short.

09:23.263 --> 09:26.765
Dare-ianna tried it,
but crashed into
our dad's carriage.

09:26.767 --> 09:29.200
(all laughing)

09:29.202 --> 09:31.436
So much for my cape/kite.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.438
(forced laughter)

09:33.440 --> 09:36.741
Just another one of Willow's
hare-brained failures, huh?

09:36.743 --> 09:38.410
(laughter stops)

09:39.780 --> 09:41.947
Awkward.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.785
(ringing)

09:46.787 --> 09:48.853
Uh, we should get going.

09:48.855 --> 09:50.956
We don't want
to miss that shower.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.259
Bye, Dare-ianna.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.794
We'll see ya.

09:55.796 --> 09:58.597
(owl hooting)

10:03.737 --> 10:05.236
I mean, don't get me wrong.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.805
I love Corona.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.306
Yeah, what's not to love?

10:08.308 --> 10:11.743
It's just once you've seen
so much of the world,

10:11.745 --> 10:13.812
it's hard to settle down
in a place like this.

10:13.814 --> 10:16.314
It's too not fun.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.782
(whispers):
I don't see how
anyone could.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.885
Okay, looks like
we're coming up
on the southern ridge.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.053
Woo-hoo!

10:22.055 --> 10:24.656
The Empyrean Shower,
here we come!

10:24.658 --> 10:26.424
I'm gonna go scope
us out a good spot.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.960
Southern ridge, huh?

10:28.962 --> 10:30.795
Yes. Why?

10:30.797 --> 10:33.598
Well, if you really want
Rapunzel to see the shower,

10:33.600 --> 10:36.501
-you ought to go--
-I ought to what, Wilhelmina?

10:37.638 --> 10:39.804
Please, enlighten us.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.173
How can we best
view the shower?

10:42.175 --> 10:45.110
Should we travel to
the Mystic Cliffs of Gushombai?

10:45.112 --> 10:47.345
Ari, is something wrong?

10:47.347 --> 10:49.114
You know what, yes.

10:49.116 --> 10:52.183
As a matter of fact,
something is wrong, Willow.

10:52.185 --> 10:55.120
You roll in like a cyclone,
appropriate my birthday.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.989
You embarrassed me in front
of my family and subjects.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.124
-(ringing)
-(groaning)

10:59.126 --> 11:01.960
And give me this...
Oo... UUmm...

11:01.962 --> 11:03.528
It's a UUmlaut.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.930
-(groans)
-(ringing)

11:05.932 --> 11:07.999
And I thought you'd like it.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.201
No! No, no, no,
you didn't, Willow.

11:10.203 --> 11:13.938
You just like what giving me
a cute, little exotic thing

11:13.940 --> 11:16.608
in front of everybody
says about you!

11:16.610 --> 11:20.545
Did it ever occur to you that
maybe a pet isn't the best gift?

11:20.547 --> 11:22.313
I found a great spot!

11:22.315 --> 11:24.482
I'm guessing not,
because not only

11:24.484 --> 11:26.317
would that take
forethought and restraint,

11:26.319 --> 11:28.019
but it would also
require a grasp

11:28.021 --> 11:30.922
of what having an actual
responsibility means!

11:32.192 --> 11:33.725
I need a minute.

11:36.496 --> 11:41.066
Um, let's hope
Lance and Eugene
are having more fun.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.967
-Lance: Pork chop?
-(fly buzzing)

11:42.969 --> 11:45.904
-(Pascal chitters)
-I kept it warm in my boot.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.372
Lance, I thought we agreed

11:47.374 --> 11:49.174
that because we were
in front of certain company,

11:49.176 --> 11:52.143
that we going to be on our,
meaning "your," best behavior.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.512
-Uh, what do you mean?
-Excellent question.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.881
Just remember,
before you say or do anything,

11:56.883 --> 11:58.049
take a second
and ask yourself,

11:58.051 --> 12:01.086
"Is what I'm about to do
or say inappropriate?"

12:01.088 --> 12:03.621
(swallows)
I'm on it.

12:04.991 --> 12:08.426
(clears throat)
So, Your Majesty,
let me ask you.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.595
How much does a king
pull down a year?

12:10.597 --> 12:11.896
After taxes.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.165
(Eugene yelling,
grunting)

12:14.167 --> 12:15.834
Lance:
Come on, man, be mature!

12:15.836 --> 12:17.469
(grunting)

12:19.573 --> 12:21.706
(exclaiming)

12:21.708 --> 12:23.842
Lance:
See what you did
to the queen's tent?

12:23.844 --> 12:25.076
(Eugene yells)

12:31.918 --> 12:33.952
(sighs)

12:33.954 --> 12:35.520
I'm sorry, Aunt Willow,

12:35.522 --> 12:38.089
but I really think I should
go talk to my mom.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.390
You heard her, 'Punzel.

12:39.392 --> 12:42.127
She needs a minute.
Trust me, she'll be fine.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.562
Don't let it ruin our night.

12:44.564 --> 12:47.365
But it's not "our" night.

12:49.236 --> 12:50.902
(exhales) 'Punzel.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.003
Wait.

12:54.241 --> 12:55.974
(whooshing)

12:57.944 --> 12:59.978
(trills)

13:01.381 --> 13:04.082
(sighs)
You're right, little guy.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.785
This is silly.
We can still
salvage the night.

13:06.787 --> 13:09.354
(whooshing)

13:21.101 --> 13:22.333
(trills)

13:22.335 --> 13:23.768
(ringing)

13:23.770 --> 13:26.171
(groans)
Would you
give it a rest?

13:26.173 --> 13:28.072
(tinkling)

13:33.613 --> 13:35.413
(squeaks)

13:35.415 --> 13:37.515
(growling)

13:40.020 --> 13:42.086
Mom!

13:42.088 --> 13:44.856
I'm so sorry
you missed the shower!

13:44.858 --> 13:47.425
And me too.
If it's any consolation, Ari,

13:47.427 --> 13:49.327
you were right about
the southern ridge.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.863
It was beautiful!

13:51.865 --> 13:55.333
Rapunzel, may I please have
a moment alone with my sister?

14:00.307 --> 14:01.773
I said "sorry."

14:01.775 --> 14:03.474
What else do you want?

14:03.476 --> 14:06.144
Willow, our whole lives,
you've done whatever
you could to show me up,

14:06.146 --> 14:07.312
and honestly,

14:07.314 --> 14:08.880
I've come to accept that.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.048
But you know what?

14:10.050 --> 14:12.050
Not when it comes
to my daughter.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.387
(growling)

14:17.791 --> 14:20.158
Tonight was supposed
to be special!

14:20.160 --> 14:22.026
Uh, it was special.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.562
I'm not the one who stormed off
seconds before the shower.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.698
I didn't storm off, Wilhelmina!

14:26.700 --> 14:28.800
-(growling)
-What's wrong?

14:28.802 --> 14:30.468
-Where's your rattle?
-(snarls)

14:30.470 --> 14:32.470
(snarling, growling)

14:36.142 --> 14:37.208
Oh!

14:37.210 --> 14:39.577
I had a specific plan
for tonight!

14:39.579 --> 14:41.179
Of course, you did.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.248
You've got a plan
for everything!

14:43.250 --> 14:44.682
You know, you think
just because

14:44.684 --> 14:45.917
you've always
got it so together,

14:45.919 --> 14:47.986
that everyone has to do
whatever you say!

14:47.988 --> 14:49.888
(growling)

14:49.890 --> 14:50.989
Oh!

14:50.991 --> 14:54.058
First of all, I never
tell you what to do,

14:54.060 --> 14:55.326
and even if I did,
you'd ignore it

14:55.328 --> 14:57.161
and do whatever
you feel like anyway!

14:59.399 --> 15:00.832
(exclaiming)

15:00.834 --> 15:03.868
You don't think I would love
to have that kind of freedom?

15:03.870 --> 15:06.204
Rapunzel:
Mom? Uh, Aunt Willow?

15:06.206 --> 15:08.506
-Both: What?
-We have a problem.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.946
Willow, what is happening?

15:14.948 --> 15:16.581
Rapunzel:
I guess now
we know what happens

15:16.583 --> 15:18.283
when she doesn't
have her rattle.

15:18.285 --> 15:21.519
You know what?
I'm gonna take
the blame on this one.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.121
I'm the one that
threw the rattle.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.455
I can't let you
take all the blame.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.190
Oh, thank goodness.

15:26.192 --> 15:27.926
You want to split it?
Fifty-fifty?

15:27.928 --> 15:30.128
Sixty-forty?
Like you said,
you threw the rattle.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.430
(snarling intensifies)

15:32.432 --> 15:35.199
-We have to get her rattle
back to her.
-Where is it?

15:38.238 --> 15:39.771
-I see it!
-Great!

15:39.773 --> 15:41.973
-Can we get it?
-Shouldn't be a problem.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.610
(wind whistling)

15:45.612 --> 15:47.612
Are you sure this doesn't hurt?

15:48.748 --> 15:50.615
I'm okay, I'm okay.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.283
Just hurry! (grunts)

15:52.285 --> 15:54.152
Eugene and Lance
are down there.

15:54.154 --> 15:57.722
Wow! The view from
down here is amazing!

15:57.724 --> 16:00.591
It reminds me of the
Mystic Cliffs of Gushombai.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.160
-Just not as--
-Willow!

16:02.162 --> 16:03.628
Oh! Right! The rattle.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.963
Got it!

16:14.674 --> 16:16.174
(tinkling)

16:17.310 --> 16:19.210
(ringing)

16:21.014 --> 16:22.847
(ringing)

16:25.018 --> 16:26.517
-(ringing)
-It's not working!

16:29.656 --> 16:31.823
We have a Plan B, right?

16:33.960 --> 16:35.360
-(trilling)
-(yelps)

16:35.362 --> 16:36.461
(coos)

16:36.463 --> 16:39.964
Well, hello there!
Look at you!

16:39.966 --> 16:41.366
-(low rumbling)
-Little cute--

16:41.368 --> 16:42.533
-(splat)
-(exclaims)

16:42.535 --> 16:44.168
(screams)

16:44.170 --> 16:47.271
(rumbling)

16:47.273 --> 16:49.007
(screams)

16:50.377 --> 16:51.876
Your Majesty, this way! Come on!

16:54.381 --> 16:56.014
(rumbling)

16:58.852 --> 17:00.351
Eugene, I just want
you to know,

17:00.353 --> 17:02.553
I will stop being
so over-overwhelmingly
ill-mannered.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.288
No, no! I need
to yell at you less

17:04.290 --> 17:05.790
when you think
you're being endearing!

17:05.792 --> 17:07.458
And I will try not to be
upset with you,

17:07.460 --> 17:09.994
when you are yelling at me for
thinking I'm being endearing.

17:09.996 --> 17:12.130
(quietly):
This trip was a mistake.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.398
-(Pascal squeaks)
-This way!

17:17.670 --> 17:19.070
Quickly! Up here!

17:19.072 --> 17:20.238
Whoa!

17:32.652 --> 17:35.486
Eugene:
Yeah. I think this is
the worst camping trip ever.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.588
Eugene!

17:37.590 --> 17:39.690
Thank goodness, you're okay!

17:39.692 --> 17:42.060
Arianna, what is going on?

17:42.062 --> 17:43.528
The UUmlaut! I--

17:43.530 --> 17:45.196
I took her rattle away.

17:45.198 --> 17:48.433
Mom, uh, we might not have time
for explanations right now.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.334
(rumbling)

17:52.505 --> 17:55.106
What do we do?
We tried to give her
the rattle back.

17:55.108 --> 17:57.708
No, we tried to give
her copy the rattle back.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.610
I think we have
to find the original.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.579
How are we gonna find
that cute, little fuzzy thing?

18:01.581 --> 18:02.947
It could be anywhere!

18:06.052 --> 18:07.452
Come on, guys.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.787
-(Arianna gasps)
-There's gotta be something
we can do.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.255
Actually...

18:11.257 --> 18:13.458
there might be.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.460
Hand me that rope.
We don't have much time.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.361
(fabric tearing)

18:17.363 --> 18:18.796
(wood splintering)

18:22.802 --> 18:24.168
(Pascal squeaks)

18:30.777 --> 18:32.477
Lance:
I don't know what this is...

18:32.479 --> 18:34.078
but I know
I'm not getting on it.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.481
(ringing)

18:36.483 --> 18:38.483
I just hope we can
get her to hear it!

18:38.485 --> 18:40.284
Here! I made this!

18:42.155 --> 18:43.721
(ringing amplified)

18:43.723 --> 18:45.590
-That'll work.
-(chuckle)

18:45.592 --> 18:47.191
I owe you one birthday gift.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.561
Okay, Will.

18:50.563 --> 18:51.996
It's a two-person job.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.764
-One to steer,
and one to shake.
-(tinkling)

18:53.766 --> 18:55.867
You'd better let me
do the flying this time.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.711
-You ready?
-Let's go.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.229
(cheering)

19:33.273 --> 19:36.174
Oh, come on.
Where are you?

19:36.176 --> 19:37.408
There!

19:38.845 --> 19:40.077
(rumbling)

19:43.016 --> 19:44.715
(ringing loudly)

19:44.717 --> 19:46.417
-(ringing continues)
-(trills)

19:51.824 --> 19:54.525
There she is! Take us in low!

19:57.830 --> 20:00.665
Okay, sis,
now it's all on you.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.400
-No pressure.
-Thanks.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.701
(ringing)

20:03.703 --> 20:04.969
(trills excitedly)

20:04.971 --> 20:06.504
(ringing)

20:06.506 --> 20:07.972
(trills)

20:07.974 --> 20:09.574
(ringing continues)

20:09.576 --> 20:11.409
(trills louder)

20:13.513 --> 20:15.313
(trills)

20:17.550 --> 20:18.583
Did she catch it?

20:20.153 --> 20:21.686
(squeaks triumphantly)

20:21.688 --> 20:23.487
-(cheering)
-Whoo! Way to go, Mom!

20:23.489 --> 20:27.358
Willow:
Nice one, Dare-ianna!

20:27.360 --> 20:30.027
Would you look at that?

20:30.029 --> 20:32.496
(rumbling)

20:32.498 --> 20:34.599
(whooshing)

20:35.935 --> 20:37.835
(whooshing)

20:39.038 --> 20:41.105
-(trills)
-(ringing)

20:44.577 --> 20:46.611
-(ringing)
-(coos)

20:55.622 --> 20:58.823
Bye, Aunt Willow!
Please come back soon.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.728
That was a heck
of a plan, Dare-ianna.

21:03.730 --> 21:07.131
It wouldn't have worked without
your hare-brained cape/kite.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.302
Love you, sis.

21:11.304 --> 21:13.638
-I love you too.
-(ringing)

21:15.875 --> 21:18.276
-Goodbye, my fancy pants.
-(cooing)

21:20.613 --> 21:23.247
Now off to explore
new lands.

21:23.249 --> 21:24.582
Tackle new adventures!

21:24.584 --> 21:26.117
And see new sights!

21:26.119 --> 21:28.486
And then, maybe
I'll have a little lunch.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.454
-Ta-ta for now!
-(horse whinnies)

21:32.825 --> 21:34.458
I'm sorry your birthday
didn't happen

21:34.460 --> 21:36.227
the way you wanted it to.

21:36.229 --> 21:39.797
Well, when am I ever
gonna get a chance
to fly a cape/kite again?

21:39.799 --> 21:42.533
Willow can be a bit
of a handful...

21:43.836 --> 21:47.638
but if was really nice
to get to know Dare-ianna.

21:49.676 --> 21:51.309
And who knows?

21:51.311 --> 21:52.643
Maybe Willow will change!

21:52.645 --> 21:55.646
I mean, she did promise
to take care of that UUmlaut.

21:55.648 --> 21:59.116
(ringing)

21:59.118 --> 22:00.418
(trills)

22:01.854 --> 22:03.688
Both:
<i> Willow!</i>

22:06.526 --> 22:10.594
(theme music playing)

22:10.596 --> 22:13.497
<i> ¶ Now I got my eyes open</i>
<i> and wide ¶</i>

22:13.499 --> 22:16.133
<i> ¶ My heart burnin' like fire ¶</i>

22:16.135 --> 22:18.302
<i> ¶ Feels like I'm so alive ¶</i>

22:18.304 --> 22:20.171
<i> ¶ I'm never goin' back ¶</i>

22:20.173 --> 22:23.007
<i> ¶ Whatever I want now,</i>
<i> I'm gonna chase ¶</i>

22:23.009 --> 22:25.509
<i> ¶ Who I am,</i>
<i> I can't contain it ¶</i>

22:25.511 --> 22:28.846
<i> ¶ I'm not gonna hold it in ¶</i>

22:28.848 --> 22:31.215
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's more of me</i>
<i> to give ¶</i>

22:31.217 --> 22:32.650
<i> ¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

22:32.652 --> 22:33.851
<i> ¶ Oh yeah ¶</i>

22:33.853 --> 22:35.920
<i> ¶ There's more of me to give ¶</i>
