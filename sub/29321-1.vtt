01:58.732 --> 02:00.464
Ugh!

02:20.621 --> 02:23.622
Dude, you knew I had to be up
early for my math test!

02:23.624 --> 02:25.925
And I have to finish
my diorama, dude.

02:25.927 --> 02:27.325
Why didn't you finish it
last night?

02:27.327 --> 02:28.661
Why didn't you study
last night?

02:28.663 --> 02:31.196
Fine. I'm just gonna tell mom
that you went

02:31.198 --> 02:32.932
to Jessica's house last week
and lied about it.

02:32.934 --> 02:34.634
And I'll tell her
that you and Marcy met

02:34.636 --> 02:36.936
Jacob Taylor and Matthew Sutton
at the mall last Saturday.

02:36.938 --> 02:38.940
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, I so would.

02:40.273 --> 02:42.142
Fine, I'll cover
your dish day tomorrow.

02:43.411 --> 02:44.810
My next three dish days.

02:44.812 --> 02:46.912
Two. Final offer.

02:46.914 --> 02:48.182
Done.

02:52.320 --> 02:55.488
Oh, and by the way,
I took a shower last night.

02:58.927 --> 03:01.594
Oh, good day, my lady.

03:07.335 --> 03:09.402
What is the sum
and difference of two cubes?

03:09.404 --> 03:10.737
Ugh!

03:10.739 --> 03:13.442
Um, sum and difference
of two cubes.

03:18.514 --> 03:20.313
Sum and difference
of two cubes.

03:20.315 --> 03:21.350
Oh!

03:22.619 --> 03:24.586
Um, difference.

03:27.723 --> 03:28.657
Ugh!

03:37.534 --> 03:39.500
Hey, watch it!

03:39.502 --> 03:40.868
I barely touched it, relax.

03:40.870 --> 03:42.837
Barely touched it?
You almost ruined it.

03:42.839 --> 03:44.539
Yeah, well, I didn't,
so stop complaining.

03:44.541 --> 03:46.474
Okay, enough, you two.

03:46.476 --> 03:49.110
Addy, you know better.
No bags on the table, ever.

03:49.112 --> 03:52.348
Ella, stop playing with the dog
and eat your breakfast.

03:55.018 --> 03:57.251
- Can I get a bowl?
- You sure can.

03:57.253 --> 03:59.622
You have got two legs
and you know where they are.

04:03.060 --> 04:05.861
- Good morning, everyone.
- Morning, honey.

04:05.863 --> 04:08.664
- Oh, good morning. Thank you.
- There you go.

04:08.666 --> 04:10.967
- Mmm, you look handsome.
- Mmhmm?

04:10.969 --> 04:12.567
Are you showing
that Briarwood house today?

04:12.569 --> 04:16.572
Yes. Yeah, well, I've got
to move on this property.

04:16.574 --> 04:17.507
Good morning, Addy.

04:22.147 --> 04:24.114
Never mind.

04:24.116 --> 04:25.849
Hey, so I was thinking
you know,

04:25.851 --> 04:27.583
the fair is in town
this weekend.

04:27.585 --> 04:29.251
What do say we all go
over tomorrow afternoon?

04:29.253 --> 04:31.353
We can grab some rides,
have some cotton candy.

04:31.355 --> 04:32.589
What do you think?
My treat.

04:32.591 --> 04:34.357
Can I bring Jessica?

04:34.359 --> 04:37.593
Well, Dad and I thought
it would be a family activity.

04:37.595 --> 04:39.495
Yeah.
What do you think, Addy?

04:39.497 --> 04:41.900
I can't. I'm hangin' out
with my dad this weekend.

04:45.670 --> 04:47.038
What?

04:48.273 --> 04:49.939
He's still coming, right?

04:49.941 --> 04:51.508
That's the plan...

04:51.510 --> 04:53.210
But you know your father.

04:53.212 --> 04:55.478
He'll be here.

04:55.480 --> 04:58.549
So since Addy is
not gonna be here,

04:58.551 --> 04:59.818
can I bring Jessica?

05:03.388 --> 05:04.322
Sure.

05:05.457 --> 05:07.758
Okay. Time to go.

05:07.760 --> 05:09.494
I do not want you all
to be late.

05:10.630 --> 05:12.963
- Lunch number 1.
- Thanks.

05:12.965 --> 05:14.398
Lunch number 2.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.633
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

05:15.635 --> 05:16.967
Bye.

05:16.969 --> 05:18.604
- Love you!
- You, too.

05:20.140 --> 05:22.641
I have to turn this in on time
or I won't get an A.

05:22.643 --> 05:24.577
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

05:47.667 --> 05:50.101
I think that math test
literally fried my brains.

05:50.103 --> 05:51.670
It could have been in German

05:51.672 --> 05:53.572
and I still would probably get
the same grade.

05:53.574 --> 05:55.340
- It wasn't that bad.
- Says you.

05:55.342 --> 05:57.210
- What?
- Yeah, you are like Matt Damon

05:57.212 --> 05:59.544
in that movie.
What's it called?

05:59.546 --> 06:01.314
- <i>Bourne Identity?</i>
- No, the one

06:01.316 --> 06:03.683
where he's a math genius.
My parents love it.

06:03.685 --> 06:06.018
Anyway, you're
like the female Matt Damon.

06:06.020 --> 06:07.386
Ew. No, I'm not.

06:07.388 --> 06:09.555
No, don't be sensitive,
you're smart.

06:09.557 --> 06:10.957
I wish I was that smart.

06:10.959 --> 06:12.691
My mom's gonna ground me
for like a week

06:12.693 --> 06:14.492
when she finds out
I bombed this test.

06:14.494 --> 06:15.928
Doesn't your sister
get straight As?

06:15.930 --> 06:17.129
Half-sister.

06:17.131 --> 06:19.465
Grades aren't hereditary,
Nicole.

06:19.467 --> 06:20.499
Whatever.

06:41.190 --> 06:42.191
Hey, Ads.

06:43.192 --> 06:44.159
Hey, Dorian.

06:45.661 --> 06:46.827
Ads?

06:46.829 --> 06:47.897
Stop!

06:49.965 --> 06:52.733
So what are you and your dad
gonna do this weekend?

06:52.735 --> 06:54.568
I don't know.
He got a new apartment,

06:54.570 --> 06:56.204
so we're probably
just gonna hang out there.

06:56.206 --> 06:58.773
And he also says
he has a surprise for me. So...

06:58.775 --> 07:00.507
When's the last time
you saw him?

07:00.509 --> 07:02.175
Um, it's been a while.

07:02.177 --> 07:04.212
I talked to him last weekend
and his band was like opening up

07:04.214 --> 07:05.913
for a band
I've never heard of.

07:05.915 --> 07:08.283
I wish my dad was a singer
in a band.

07:08.285 --> 07:10.718
Tell my mom that and all
she does is complain about him.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.220
Well,
I think your dad's cool.

07:12.222 --> 07:14.390
I mean I love my dad,
but he's an accountant

07:14.392 --> 07:15.823
and that's pretty lame.

07:15.825 --> 07:18.426
- Alright, bye. See you Monday.
- Bye, see you.

07:18.428 --> 07:20.828
So how was your math test?

07:20.830 --> 07:23.065
Ugh, you know.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.732
That bad, huh?

07:24.734 --> 07:26.433
Hopefully, it's fine.

07:26.435 --> 07:27.769
How was your diorama?

07:27.771 --> 07:29.570
It was good.

07:29.572 --> 07:30.772
Good?

07:30.774 --> 07:32.540
Just good?
I thought it was pretty lit.

07:32.542 --> 07:35.311
Thanks.
I spent all week on it.

07:35.313 --> 07:37.112
Is your dad coming tonight?

07:37.114 --> 07:39.048
Yes. Yeah, he is.

07:39.050 --> 07:41.450
Cool. I like your dad.
He's the best.

07:41.452 --> 07:42.985
<i>In sports, the International...</i>

07:42.987 --> 07:44.421
High five.

07:44.423 --> 07:45.921
Oh, sorry, yeah.

07:45.923 --> 07:48.290
Right there, good girl!

07:48.292 --> 07:49.792
Here.

07:52.462 --> 07:53.564
Hey!

08:00.805 --> 08:02.738
There is my princess.

08:02.740 --> 08:05.241
- Hi, Dad.
- Oh, I've missed you.

08:05.243 --> 08:06.475
I missed you, too.

08:06.477 --> 08:07.510
How was tour?

08:07.512 --> 08:09.913
Hey, the tour was a blast.

08:09.915 --> 08:12.915
Five bands,
and the crowds were great,

08:12.917 --> 08:14.583
and they liked us so...

08:14.585 --> 08:15.885
Well, yeah, I play your songs

08:15.887 --> 08:17.653
to my friends all the time
and we love it.

08:17.655 --> 08:19.555
Oh,
that's what I like to hear.

08:19.557 --> 08:20.824
Hey there, Gwendolyn.

08:20.826 --> 08:22.959
- You're looking good.
- Thank you, Robert.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.928
Oh, big James!

08:24.930 --> 08:26.830
- Good to see you, buddy.
- Yeah, you, too.

08:26.832 --> 08:29.433
You, too. Looks like tour life
is treating you well.

08:29.435 --> 08:31.002
- Well, I can't complain.
- Yeah.

08:31.004 --> 08:31.904
I bet.

08:33.139 --> 08:34.472
And Miss Ella,
how are you?

08:34.475 --> 08:36.606
I'm great. Have you met Dally?

08:36.607 --> 08:39.143
I believe I have,
but hello again, Dally.

08:39.145 --> 08:41.778
Oh, I got you guys somethin'.

08:41.780 --> 08:44.782
Um,
thought you might like these.

08:44.784 --> 08:47.985
- Signed by Coral herself.
- You know Coral?

08:47.987 --> 08:49.520
Yeah,
we've been on tour together.

08:49.522 --> 08:52.290
- Sure, I know Coral.
- Dad, this is so cool.

08:52.292 --> 08:54.159
Seriously, Robert,
thank you.

08:54.161 --> 08:55.994
- Anytime. My pleasure.
- Hey.

08:55.996 --> 08:57.528
Uh, can we offer you a drink?

08:57.530 --> 09:00.998
We've got um, apple juice.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.666
Actually,
we should get goin'.

09:02.668 --> 09:04.869
I have a surprise
for my little princess

09:04.871 --> 09:06.871
and I don't want us
to be late. So...

09:06.873 --> 09:09.174
Are you taking me somewhere
for the weekend?

09:09.176 --> 09:10.976
Uh, about the weekend...

09:10.978 --> 09:13.979
Oh boy, here we go again.
What is it this time, Robert?

09:13.981 --> 09:16.148
Mom! Let Dad talk.

09:16.150 --> 09:19.519
I have a three-day festival
that I have to go do,

09:19.521 --> 09:21.954
but I swear
I'll be back Tuesday,

09:21.956 --> 09:24.189
and I'll come pick you up,
and you can stay with me

09:24.191 --> 09:25.556
till I go back on tour.

09:25.558 --> 09:27.325
Okay, yeah, that's fine,
that's great.

09:27.327 --> 09:29.961
Robert, why don't you and I have
a little chat outside?

09:29.963 --> 09:31.364
Mom?

09:31.366 --> 09:32.532
Addy.

09:32.534 --> 09:33.834
It's okay, baby.

09:44.245 --> 09:45.578
What is it?

09:45.580 --> 09:47.679
When are you gonna stop
doing this to her?

09:47.681 --> 09:49.916
I've got one more gig
and I'll be set.

09:49.918 --> 09:52.185
We'll have plenty
of time together after that.

09:52.187 --> 09:54.387
It's always one more gig
with you, Robert.

09:54.389 --> 09:57.090
- It's exactly why we didn't work out.
- Oh!

09:57.092 --> 09:59.226
I got over you
not being a good husband,

09:59.228 --> 10:01.228
I don't know how she's
gonna be able to get over you

10:01.230 --> 10:02.264
not being a good dad.

10:05.367 --> 10:07.303
I'm doing the best I can,
Gwen.

10:13.741 --> 10:15.077
Let's go, princess.

10:21.016 --> 10:21.917
Hug.

10:23.752 --> 10:25.752
We won't be late,
I promise.

10:25.754 --> 10:26.956
Right.
See you later.

Hey, one of your
headlights is out.

11:52.644 --> 11:55.145
Oh, yeah, I know.
I've been meaning to fix that.

11:55.147 --> 11:56.681
It takes
like five minutes to fix.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.649
Well, I procrastinate
on some things.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.016
You mean your life?

12:00.018 --> 12:03.054
Oh, don't be a smart-ass,
come on.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.589
Reminds me though,
remember that game

12:04.591 --> 12:05.990
we used to play
when you were a kid

12:05.992 --> 12:08.259
where you're drivin' along
and see a car

12:08.261 --> 12:10.828
with a headlight out,
do you remember?

12:10.830 --> 12:13.564
No, no, no, God.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.166
Th... cut that's cheating,
come on.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.866
No, it's not.
Those are your rules!

12:16.868 --> 12:18.669
Oh, that's cheating.

12:18.671 --> 12:20.204
- God.
- You're just mad I won.

12:20.206 --> 12:21.906
Oh, okay.

12:23.544 --> 12:24.676
What's all this about?

12:24.678 --> 12:26.811
- You'll see.
- Okay.

12:26.813 --> 12:28.582
Just be patient,
just another second.

12:29.683 --> 12:31.350
Alright.

12:31.352 --> 12:33.085
Prepare yourself.

12:33.087 --> 12:35.586
What am I lookin' at?

12:35.588 --> 12:39.190
Say "hello" to Spanky.

12:39.192 --> 12:42.694
Oh, oh. Hi, Spanky.

12:44.365 --> 12:46.734
- I know. Isn't he cute?
- Hi, buddy.

12:48.469 --> 12:49.901
Dad, why are we here?

12:49.903 --> 12:52.705
I thought you'd enjoy this,
just the two of us.

12:52.707 --> 12:53.805
And Spanky.

12:53.807 --> 12:54.808
And Spanky.

12:56.110 --> 12:58.077
- Is he yours?
- He sure is.

12:58.079 --> 12:59.378
When did you get him?

12:59.380 --> 13:01.748
I got him a couple
of months ago.

13:01.750 --> 13:03.716
My friend Matt couldn't
take care of him anymore,

13:03.718 --> 13:06.519
asked if I'd help out,
and I said, "Sure".

13:06.521 --> 13:08.288
Well, that was
really nice of you.

13:08.290 --> 13:10.590
Well, they take really
good care of him here.

13:10.592 --> 13:12.892
At least, they will
till the end of the month.

13:12.894 --> 13:14.162
Oh, it's just for a month?

13:16.097 --> 13:17.432
I'll think of something.

13:19.034 --> 13:21.868
I know you think
I'm irresponsible.

13:21.870 --> 13:24.637
And I guess
I do some crazy stuff.

13:24.639 --> 13:26.441
I mean I got a miniature horse,
right?

13:28.043 --> 13:29.911
I don't think
you're irresponsible.

13:31.112 --> 13:35.048
Well, I know I do some

13:35.050 --> 13:37.251
random things in my life,

13:37.253 --> 13:42.323
but you, Addy,
are my anchor.

13:42.325 --> 13:45.959
You're the only thing
that keeps me centered at all.

13:45.961 --> 13:47.994
If you weren't around,
I'd have no place

13:47.996 --> 13:50.232
to always come back to.

13:53.869 --> 13:55.304
You might be a little crazy...

13:56.339 --> 13:58.305
...but you're my dad.

13:58.307 --> 14:00.941
You're like the most
important person in my world.

14:00.943 --> 14:02.109
Oh!

14:02.111 --> 14:03.445
Well, you and Mom.

14:03.447 --> 14:05.315
And Ella,
when she's not being annoying.

14:07.150 --> 14:09.050
You give this to Spanky

14:09.052 --> 14:11.253
and I'm gonna give this
to you.

14:12.388 --> 14:14.589
I made this for you.

14:14.591 --> 14:16.424
I know you kids
don't do CDs anymore,

14:16.426 --> 14:17.958
but that's how I roll.

14:17.960 --> 14:19.160
What's on it?

14:19.162 --> 14:21.363
Just some stuff
I've been working on.

14:21.365 --> 14:24.802
And the best of it,
you were the inspiration for.

14:26.370 --> 14:27.369
Thanks, Dad.

14:27.371 --> 14:29.372
Oh.

14:29.374 --> 14:31.207
Thank you, princess.

14:31.209 --> 14:33.976
Okay, let's put Spanky up
and go get some food, okay?

14:33.978 --> 14:35.510
- I'm starving.
- Alright, okay.

14:38.982 --> 14:40.616
I just wanted you
to meet Spanky.

14:40.618 --> 14:41.684
He's adorable, right?

14:41.686 --> 14:43.219
- Yeah.
- Okay.

14:43.221 --> 14:44.720
- Bye, Spanky.
- Bye, buddy.

14:44.722 --> 14:46.655
Yeah, okay,
I'll come see you tomorrow.

14:46.657 --> 14:48.859
Good boy.

14:48.861 --> 14:50.294
Alright.

15:07.912 --> 15:09.912
Thought you were
getting back early.

15:09.914 --> 15:11.548
I know, I'm sorry.

15:11.550 --> 15:13.116
Traffic was bad
on the way back.

15:13.118 --> 15:15.786
Always something with you,
isn't it, Robert?

15:15.788 --> 15:17.755
Mom, that's enough.

15:17.757 --> 15:19.456
It's fine.

15:19.458 --> 15:20.424
Goodnight, Dad.

15:20.426 --> 15:21.659
Goodnight, baby.

15:21.661 --> 15:23.729
- I love you.
- I love you, princess.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.766
I'm sorry to be on edge,

15:29.768 --> 15:32.068
but things are
a little tight around here.

15:32.070 --> 15:34.204
Addy needs new shoes,
a backpack...

15:34.206 --> 15:35.773
I thought James
was doing great.

15:35.775 --> 15:39.677
Well, it's hard! He just started
his own business.

15:39.679 --> 15:41.546
I'll make sure
to send you a check

15:41.548 --> 15:43.281
as soon as I get back
from the festival.

15:43.283 --> 15:45.550
It's not just about a check,
Robert.

15:45.552 --> 15:47.451
She's your daughter,
not James'.

15:47.453 --> 15:51.925
Could we... could we please talk
about this on Tuesday, okay?

15:53.959 --> 15:55.829
Please don't
disappoint her again.

15:57.163 --> 15:58.097
Yes, ma'am.

15:59.733 --> 16:01.600
You don't always have
to treat him this way, you know.

16:01.602 --> 16:03.134
Addy, go to bed.

16:03.136 --> 16:05.904
I know you hate him,
but he's trying, okay?

16:05.906 --> 16:07.239
I don't hate him.

16:07.241 --> 16:08.607
Yeah?

16:08.609 --> 16:10.812
You got a really funny way
of showing it then.

16:16.784 --> 16:21.422
- What was that?
- Nothing. Just Addy being Addy.

17:17.046 --> 17:19.413
Hey, what's up?

17:19.415 --> 17:21.550
<i>You're gonna love this,
check your email.</i>

17:21.551 --> 17:22.486
Okay.

17:25.021 --> 17:29.557
"We never really move on,
we just get used to the pain."

17:31.227 --> 17:33.962
<i>I know. He's gone full emo.</i>

17:33.964 --> 17:35.564
Where did you get this?

17:35.566 --> 17:37.899
<i>He just posted it
on Instagram.</i>

17:37.901 --> 17:39.968
Oh, what are you
like stalking now?

17:39.970 --> 17:42.904
<i>Come on,
I'm doing this for you, Ads.</i>

17:45.309 --> 17:47.010
Mom, can you like knock?

17:49.046 --> 17:50.514
Addy, honey.

17:54.585 --> 17:56.685
Um, I'm gonna call you back,
okay?

17:56.687 --> 17:57.588
<i>Everything o...</i>

17:58.957 --> 18:00.457
Mom, what's wrong?

18:13.604 --> 18:15.505
Addy, honey.

18:18.610 --> 18:21.512
Addy, your father
was in a car accident...

18:23.615 --> 18:25.550
What?

18:31.390 --> 18:32.725
I'm so sorry.

18:38.196 --> 18:39.330
No.

18:41.432 --> 18:42.568
No.

18:44.637 --> 18:46.572
Mom.

20:23.106 --> 20:25.739
Well, Robert never remarried

20:25.741 --> 20:27.507
and didn't have other children,

20:27.509 --> 20:31.145
so the next of kin is you,
Addy.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.683
And w... what does this
all mean exactly?

20:34.916 --> 20:37.317
Well, let's see.

20:37.319 --> 20:42.189
Uh, there is a guitar
signed by various rock artists.

20:42.191 --> 20:45.358
Uh, then there is an original
collection of records,

20:45.360 --> 20:47.530
as well as a vintage
record player.

20:49.365 --> 20:55.706
Uh, there's a checking account
in the balance of $828.92

20:59.509 --> 21:02.779
And lastly,
there is Robert's horse.

21:04.947 --> 21:07.381
- He's given me Spanky?
- What... who's Spanky?

21:07.383 --> 21:09.251
Yes, there is a horse

21:09.253 --> 21:11.620
in Robert's possession
named "Spanky".

21:11.622 --> 21:13.588
Uh, also
one-way transportation costs

21:13.590 --> 21:17.425
have been paid,
along with a bucket of oats

21:17.427 --> 21:20.129
- and a couple of bales of hay.
- Excuse me.

21:20.131 --> 21:22.231
Excuse me,
excuse me, a horse?

21:22.233 --> 21:25.399
Like a... like a real...

21:25.401 --> 21:27.469
Like a... um, horse?

21:27.471 --> 21:29.304
Yes, sir.

21:29.306 --> 21:31.907
Is it legal to keep a horse
in the suburbs?

21:31.909 --> 21:34.243
- He's a miniature horse, James.
- Miniature, okay.

21:34.245 --> 21:36.645
What does it cost to feed
and board a horse?

21:36.647 --> 21:38.480
Does it say in the... in the
will, what it... What it costs?

21:38.482 --> 21:40.249
Is there an instruction manual?

21:40.251 --> 21:42.552
Honey, I think right now
we need to focus

21:42.554 --> 21:47.823
on Robert's wishes
and bring the horse here

21:47.825 --> 21:51.594
until we can figure out
something more suitable for him.

21:51.596 --> 21:53.698
Keep him in the back...
in the backyard?

21:58.336 --> 21:59.704
Alright. Alrighty, then.

22:01.841 --> 22:03.374
So Spanky's ours now?

22:05.010 --> 22:06.579
Technically, he's yours.

22:11.816 --> 22:13.885
So Spanky, huh?

22:15.020 --> 22:15.921
Yep.

22:18.157 --> 22:19.357
That's a funny name.

22:21.460 --> 22:22.828
When did your dad
get a horse?

22:23.863 --> 22:25.462
Like a couple of months ago.

22:25.464 --> 22:27.531
Why?

22:27.533 --> 22:30.168
I don't know. His friend
gave it to him or something.

22:30.170 --> 22:31.669
Enough with the questions.

22:31.671 --> 22:32.772
Okay.

22:44.818 --> 22:47.051
Leave it to Robert
to do something so random.

22:47.053 --> 22:50.655
I still don't know
how he got a horse.

22:50.657 --> 22:52.191
What are we
supposed to do now?

22:52.193 --> 22:53.558
I have no clue.

22:53.560 --> 22:57.029
I'm going over our finances
and it is bad.

22:57.031 --> 23:00.464
We're not gonna be able
to keep this horse for long.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.502
Well, like we have
to figure something out.

23:27.395 --> 23:29.261
We're so sorry, Addy.

23:29.263 --> 23:32.234
If there is anything you need,
let us know.

23:35.270 --> 23:36.238
We're here for you.

24:04.533 --> 24:07.001
Hey, you're home late.

24:07.003 --> 24:09.305
Yeah, I just had to clear
my mind a little bit.

24:10.739 --> 24:14.141
Look. Dally can totally give
a high five now.

24:14.143 --> 24:16.143
Good girl!

24:16.145 --> 24:17.610
So cool, isn't it?

24:17.612 --> 24:20.049
Yes, it's very cool.

24:23.853 --> 24:26.355
Hey, do you maybe
wanna hang out with us?

24:26.357 --> 24:28.290
I could show you
some more tricks.

24:28.292 --> 24:31.760
Listen, Ella, I know you're just
trying to help and everything,

24:31.762 --> 24:35.162
but I just need
some space, okay?

24:35.164 --> 24:36.998
Sure.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.135
Alright,
I'm gonna go to my room now.

25:45.838 --> 25:48.907
I am the pancake king!

25:53.245 --> 25:55.245
Hi.

25:55.247 --> 25:56.182
You're up early.

25:58.250 --> 25:59.716
Wow!

25:59.718 --> 26:02.653
Nice um, pancakes.

26:02.655 --> 26:04.556
Yeah.

26:04.558 --> 26:07.861
I wanted to uh, surprise you
with one of my famous designs.

26:16.269 --> 26:18.602
I know it's hard, Addy.

26:18.604 --> 26:20.271
- Do you?
- I do.

26:20.273 --> 26:23.808
My mom died
when I was about your age.

26:23.810 --> 26:24.744
Oh.

26:25.946 --> 26:27.313
Um, I didn't know that.

26:27.315 --> 26:29.482
No, it's okay.
I don't usually talk about it.

26:29.484 --> 26:31.283
It all happened really fast.

26:31.285 --> 26:35.088
She got sick, and then a few
months later, she was gone.

26:36.289 --> 26:37.691
I'm really sorry, James.

26:39.292 --> 26:41.993
I remember feeling
very withdrawn,

26:41.995 --> 26:43.598
very angry.

26:45.299 --> 26:46.267
Yeah.

26:48.302 --> 26:49.802
Anyway... Ahem.

26:49.804 --> 26:52.104
My mom was
a really good baker,

26:52.106 --> 26:56.243
so now anytime I bake,
I think about her.

26:56.245 --> 26:58.878
So she's gone, but uh...

26:58.880 --> 27:00.579
...she's here whenever I want.

27:00.581 --> 27:02.548
Did she use to make pancakes
like these?

27:02.550 --> 27:04.451
Like these? No.
No, that's all me.

27:04.453 --> 27:06.919
I got to say I think
I crushed these this morning.

27:06.921 --> 27:08.255
Might be my masterpiece.

27:08.257 --> 27:09.857
I almost don't want you
to eat 'em.

27:11.126 --> 27:12.461
You know,
maybe there's something...

27:13.795 --> 27:18.131
...fun that would remind you
of your dad.

27:18.133 --> 27:19.166
Like what?

27:19.168 --> 27:21.034
Could be music.

27:21.036 --> 27:22.238
No.

27:23.771 --> 27:26.139
Every time I hear
one of his songs, I cry.

27:26.141 --> 27:27.340
So...

27:27.342 --> 27:29.209
Did Robert bake?

27:29.211 --> 27:30.477
I don't think so.

27:30.479 --> 27:32.380
Yeah, well, you know,
I'm out of ideas,

27:32.382 --> 27:35.550
but something fun,
something crazy.

27:35.552 --> 27:37.886
It's gonna be up to you
to find out what that is.

27:39.222 --> 27:40.590
Thanks, James.

27:42.392 --> 27:46.793
You
are most welcome, my lady.

27:59.209 --> 28:01.175
You're a cute little horse,
aren't you?

28:04.381 --> 28:06.317
Some surprise Dad left me.

28:08.419 --> 28:11.385
I read online
that horses like carrots.

28:11.387 --> 28:13.424
Do you like carrots?

28:17.394 --> 28:18.529
Dang! Ha, ha.

28:21.031 --> 28:22.731
Wow!

28:22.733 --> 28:24.301
You sure do.

28:27.405 --> 28:29.274
Hmm, let's try something.

28:32.077 --> 28:33.311
You follow me?

28:34.411 --> 28:35.744
Come here.

28:41.686 --> 28:43.954
Alright, let's go over here.

28:45.756 --> 28:48.191
Good job!

28:48.193 --> 28:49.826
Alright, now this way.

28:49.828 --> 28:51.995
Good!

28:51.997 --> 28:53.365
And this way.

28:58.436 --> 29:00.238
Alright, one more time.
Come again.

29:03.408 --> 29:06.443
You did so good!

29:06.445 --> 29:07.380
Another one?

29:12.618 --> 29:13.751
You cleaned me out.

29:13.753 --> 29:15.919
They're all gone.

29:49.155 --> 29:51.222
Hey, what's up?

29:51.224 --> 29:53.124
Can I talk to you
about something?

29:53.126 --> 29:54.795
Sure. Come on in.

29:57.898 --> 29:58.932
Talk to me.

30:01.502 --> 30:05.504
I know it's been really hard
on Addy since her dad died.

30:05.506 --> 30:07.306
I've been trying
to be nice to her,

30:07.308 --> 30:10.642
but it's just really hard.

30:10.644 --> 30:14.012
- I feel like she hates me.
- No, honey.

30:14.014 --> 30:15.781
She doesn't hate you.

30:15.783 --> 30:19.685
She just is going through
a really hard time.

30:19.687 --> 30:23.189
But I think she's starting
to feel a little better.

30:23.191 --> 30:24.523
How do you know that?

30:24.525 --> 30:27.126
Well, I saw her today
with Spanky.

30:27.128 --> 30:29.128
And I think
he's good for her.

30:29.130 --> 30:32.064
You know how Dally makes you
feel better when you're sad?

30:32.066 --> 30:33.400
Hmm.

30:33.402 --> 30:35.436
That's what Spanky
is doing for Addy.

30:38.072 --> 30:41.340
I just wish Addy and I could be
friends again.

30:41.342 --> 30:43.577
- Like before.
- Yeah, well,

30:43.579 --> 30:46.213
some of that has to do
with growing up.

30:46.215 --> 30:47.913
But it will get better,
I promise.

30:47.915 --> 30:50.050
And in the meantime,

30:50.052 --> 30:54.491
the only thing you can do
is be a good sister to her.

30:59.994 --> 31:02.064
- Thanks, Mom.
- Anytime.

31:04.233 --> 31:05.934
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

31:20.718 --> 31:21.719
I made you something.

31:22.918 --> 31:24.487
Oh, thanks, Ella.

31:26.589 --> 31:27.889
Mmm.

31:27.891 --> 31:29.690
I haven't had this
in like forever.

31:29.692 --> 31:31.192
Remember when we had

31:31.194 --> 31:33.528
- that chugging contest when we were little?
- Yeah.

31:33.530 --> 31:35.464
And we had to stay home
from school the whole day,

31:35.466 --> 31:36.632
'cause we were so sick.

31:36.634 --> 31:38.534
I know!
You had like eight glasses.

31:38.536 --> 31:39.601
I had nine.

31:39.603 --> 31:40.602
I beat you by one.

31:40.604 --> 31:42.037
Mom was so mad.

31:42.039 --> 31:43.439
Yeah, she was.

31:43.441 --> 31:45.607
What are you looking at?

31:45.609 --> 31:47.876
I'm doing some
research on horse training.

31:47.878 --> 31:50.412
Spanky really likes carrots,
so I'm gonna use those

31:50.414 --> 31:52.614
- and get him to do stuff.
- Like what?

31:52.616 --> 31:55.617
I don't know. That's what
I'm trying to figure out.

31:55.619 --> 31:57.619
I wanna get Dally
to do some new tricks.

31:57.621 --> 32:01.658
- Like roll over, play dead, and things like that.
- Hmm.

32:01.660 --> 32:04.193
Do you think I could watch you
train Spanky sometime?

32:04.195 --> 32:06.296
Yeah, I'm actually
gonna go outside right now.

32:06.298 --> 32:08.198
- Do you wanna come?
- I'd love that.

32:08.200 --> 32:10.632
- Okay, cool. Bring Dally.
- Dally.

32:10.634 --> 32:13.402
- Come here, girl.
- Dally?

32:13.404 --> 32:14.804
Dally?

32:14.806 --> 32:16.972
She must be around here
somewhere.

32:16.974 --> 32:19.642
Where did she go?

32:19.644 --> 32:20.679
Dally?

32:33.192 --> 32:34.924
Uh, is your dog
lying on my pony?

32:34.926 --> 32:36.061
I think so.

32:38.497 --> 32:39.496
But how?

32:39.498 --> 32:41.066
I have no idea.

32:43.268 --> 32:44.502
- Hey, girl.
- Hey, guys.

32:44.504 --> 32:46.370
How did you get up here?

32:46.372 --> 32:48.706
I don't know about you,
but I think this is pretty cool.

32:48.708 --> 32:50.307
I know.

32:50.309 --> 32:52.746
I've never seen a dog
on top of a horse before.

32:54.681 --> 32:57.482
You think she'll stay
if Spanky starts walking around?

32:57.484 --> 33:00.620
I mean there's only one way
to find out, right?

33:04.590 --> 33:06.290
Hold on!

33:06.292 --> 33:08.192
Come on, Spanky!

33:08.194 --> 33:11.363
She's doing it!
Dally's riding Spanky!

33:11.365 --> 33:12.964
Come here.

33:12.966 --> 33:15.300
- Good jo... oh, cute!
- Are you getting this?

33:15.302 --> 33:17.102
Oh yeah!

33:17.104 --> 33:18.703
Good job, guys!

33:18.705 --> 33:20.305
You did so good!

33:21.809 --> 33:23.542
Alright, should we go
and do more research?

33:23.544 --> 33:24.709
Yeah.

33:24.711 --> 33:25.877
Come on, Dally.

33:25.879 --> 33:27.812
Here, girl.

33:27.814 --> 33:28.813
Come on.

33:28.815 --> 33:30.183
Yay!

33:34.856 --> 33:36.691
Aren't you gonna
come look at this?

33:41.429 --> 33:43.931
Why don't I take it from here?

33:43.933 --> 33:45.199
Okay.

33:48.535 --> 33:49.804
Dally.

33:56.177 --> 33:57.911
Sit.

33:57.913 --> 33:59.312
Good girl!

33:59.314 --> 34:00.716
Okay.

34:02.751 --> 34:03.919
Okay, down.

34:06.154 --> 34:09.523
Awesome. Good job, Dally.

34:09.525 --> 34:10.656
Come on, girl.

34:10.658 --> 34:12.091
Come on. Roll over.

34:12.092 --> 34:13.860
You can do it.

34:13.862 --> 34:15.896
Keep it coming.

34:15.898 --> 34:19.032
Good girl. Amazing, Dally!

34:19.034 --> 34:22.668
See? Even your little sister
can teach you a few things.

34:22.670 --> 34:24.170
Okay, Professor Dunham.

34:24.172 --> 34:25.708
- We gonna do this or what?
- Ha, ha.

34:29.110 --> 34:30.545
Look!

34:30.547 --> 34:33.947
Good girl!
Here you go, here you go!

34:33.949 --> 34:34.850
Yeah.

34:40.289 --> 34:41.791
Hey.

34:43.793 --> 34:45.695
- Oh, bring it.
- Oh!

34:46.795 --> 34:48.663
Go get it. Go.

34:48.665 --> 34:50.431
Yay, girl!

34:50.433 --> 34:52.300
Come on, bring it. Bring it.

34:52.302 --> 34:53.802
Right.

34:53.804 --> 34:55.039
Here.

35:00.744 --> 35:02.143
Come here. Bring it back.

35:02.145 --> 35:04.748
- Bring it... please!
- Come back.

35:07.051 --> 35:08.984
Give it back!

35:08.986 --> 35:10.755
Give it to me.

35:17.428 --> 35:18.863
Drop it.

35:30.841 --> 35:33.411
What is it doing?

35:40.052 --> 35:41.386
Good girl.

35:46.824 --> 35:48.290
Oh!

35:48.292 --> 35:49.193
Oh!

35:56.068 --> 35:58.001
Yay!

35:58.003 --> 35:59.538
Oh!

36:01.740 --> 36:03.373
Dally, load up.

36:03.375 --> 36:04.642
- Yay!
- Yeah!

36:04.644 --> 36:05.812
Good!

36:12.818 --> 36:14.153
What are you doing?

36:26.365 --> 36:27.631
How about when Spanky
was running

36:27.633 --> 36:29.167
and Dally was staying on
perfectly?

36:29.169 --> 36:31.636
He was going pretty fast, too.
I mean it was awesome.

36:31.638 --> 36:34.004
Who has seen a dog
ride a horse before?

36:34.006 --> 36:35.406
I certainly haven't.

36:35.408 --> 36:37.675
- Me neither.
- You know what we should do?

36:37.677 --> 36:39.211
We should make
an Instagram account for them

36:39.213 --> 36:40.611
and we should call it, um...

36:40.613 --> 36:41.779
A Dog and Pony Show.

36:41.781 --> 36:43.682
- Yes!
- I'll make it right now.

36:43.684 --> 36:45.550
I'll post some photos
and videos from today.

36:45.552 --> 36:46.618
Perfect.

36:46.620 --> 36:48.053
Now, which one of you two

36:48.055 --> 36:50.223
- taught Dally to ride Spanky?
- Neither of us.

36:50.225 --> 36:52.524
We just walked outside
and Dally was lying on Spanky.

36:52.526 --> 36:53.827
Crazy, right?

36:55.063 --> 36:56.195
Brilliant!

36:57.931 --> 36:59.363
What?

36:59.365 --> 37:00.834
Oh, Dad!

37:03.303 --> 37:04.770
James?

37:04.772 --> 37:05.839
Yes, honey?

37:10.779 --> 37:11.880
What is it?

37:14.682 --> 37:17.784
I'm really happy that the girls
are having so much fun

37:17.786 --> 37:19.519
with Dally and Spanky.

37:19.521 --> 37:21.556
I think Addy's
getting better...

37:22.957 --> 37:24.957
But...

37:24.959 --> 37:27.460
But I don't think
we can keep Spanky.

37:27.462 --> 37:28.928
You've seen our bank account.

37:28.930 --> 37:30.930
We can't afford a horse.

37:30.932 --> 37:33.133
Look, I get it.

37:33.135 --> 37:35.803
Addy's dad gave her Spanky
and I don't want her to think

37:35.805 --> 37:38.471
we're being insensitive
about that.

37:38.473 --> 37:42.142
But I do think I've found
a place where Spanky can go.

37:42.144 --> 37:44.611
- Really?
- Hmm.

37:44.613 --> 37:46.512
Where?

37:46.514 --> 37:48.748
A guy who's
got a ranch up north,

37:48.750 --> 37:51.151
he's got plenty of space
for Spanky.

37:51.153 --> 37:52.786
We can come meet him whenever.

37:55.024 --> 37:57.457
I don't know
if we can do that to Addy.

37:57.459 --> 38:00.295
Maybe I can just pick up
an extra shift at the practice.

38:00.297 --> 38:03.932
You know that's
only a temporary solution.

38:03.934 --> 38:07.137
I know, but it's a start.

38:10.573 --> 38:12.005
You're right.

38:12.007 --> 38:13.740
And maybe if I close on one
of these houses soon,

38:13.742 --> 38:16.313
that will give us a little extra
breathing room, too.

38:17.814 --> 38:19.747
Thank you for being so good
about this.

38:19.749 --> 38:22.018
Anything
for you and the girls.

39:02.660 --> 39:03.761
Hey, Spanky.

39:05.197 --> 39:06.996
What are you doin' here?

39:06.998 --> 39:08.864
I mean it's been a long day.

39:08.866 --> 39:10.233
You're not too tired?

39:12.037 --> 39:13.171
Oh, is that so?

39:14.740 --> 39:16.406
I had a lot of fun with you,
too.

39:16.408 --> 39:18.543
And we'll keep doing it
for as long as we can.

39:20.846 --> 39:23.646
Alright, well,
I've gotta get some sleep.

39:23.648 --> 39:26.316
We'll work on more stuff
tomorrow. Okay?

39:26.318 --> 39:28.151
As soon as I get back
from school.

39:28.153 --> 39:29.886
Deal?

39:29.888 --> 39:31.755
Alright, deal.

39:31.757 --> 39:33.192
Goodnight, Spanky.

39:54.147 --> 39:56.881
This test was
certainly a mixed result.

39:56.883 --> 40:00.653
Some of you did well,
but a lot of you fell short.

40:11.664 --> 40:13.198
Guys, look at this.

40:13.200 --> 40:15.533
Okay, so we trained Dally
to jump up on Spanky.

40:15.535 --> 40:17.903
And all we have to do is point
to Spanky's back.

40:17.905 --> 40:20.205
And she jumps on his back
just like that?

40:20.207 --> 40:22.274
- Yeah, just like that.
- Cool.

40:22.276 --> 40:23.575
Okay, look at this one.

40:23.577 --> 40:25.744
So all I have to do
is walk over,

40:25.746 --> 40:28.149
and hold out a carrot,
and watch this.

40:31.419 --> 40:33.086
You guys should
totally enter them

40:33.088 --> 40:34.753
into the school talent show.

40:34.755 --> 40:36.054
The talent show?

40:36.056 --> 40:37.823
Yeah. It's coming up
in two weeks.

40:37.825 --> 40:40.926
The first prize is 1,000 bucks
and a bottomless ice cream bowl

40:40.928 --> 40:43.098
at Fifty-Five Flavors.

40:44.531 --> 40:46.099
Hmm.

40:46.101 --> 40:48.334
$1,000.

40:48.336 --> 40:51.840
But what if Spanky you know,
poops on stage?

40:53.174 --> 40:55.041
What are you
talking about?

40:55.043 --> 40:57.344
Horses take massive dumps
all the time.

40:57.346 --> 40:58.978
One time
when I was in New York,

40:58.980 --> 41:00.880
I was in the front seat
on a carriage ride,

41:00.882 --> 41:03.218
trust me, there were some things
you can't unsee.

41:04.686 --> 41:07.287
I think we'll be fine.

41:07.289 --> 41:09.789
Oh my God, I've been waiting
for this all day.

41:09.791 --> 41:12.126
I really wanna try out some
new stuff with Dally and Spanky.

41:12.128 --> 41:13.861
Yeah? Well, guess what?

41:13.863 --> 41:16.697
- Now we have a purpose.
- What do you mean?

41:16.699 --> 41:18.532
My school's talent show.

41:18.534 --> 41:20.534
I think we should enter
Dally and Spanky.

41:20.536 --> 41:23.203
- Are you serious about this?
- Does it look like I'm not?

41:23.205 --> 41:25.806
Addy, this is so cool!

41:25.808 --> 41:28.709
Okay, but I wanna talk to you
about something first, okay?

41:28.711 --> 41:31.545
So I overheard Mom
and James talking last night

41:31.547 --> 41:33.814
and apparently they're
not doing so well with money.

41:33.816 --> 41:35.015
- Really?
- Yeah,

41:35.017 --> 41:36.683
and Spanky
is costing so much.

41:36.685 --> 41:38.819
I don't know if he'll be around
for much longer.

41:38.821 --> 41:41.056
But what if we win
the talent show?

41:41.058 --> 41:42.524
Maybe they'll
change their mind?

41:42.526 --> 41:45.326
Maybe. But I was thinking
was if we win,

41:45.328 --> 41:47.027
we could give them
the prize money.

41:47.029 --> 41:49.563
$1,000 could pay for Spanky's
food for a while, you know?

41:49.565 --> 41:50.764
Yeah, that's fine.

41:50.766 --> 41:52.267
And you're totally cool
with that?

41:52.269 --> 41:55.203
I mean Spanky is
our responsibility now, right?

41:55.205 --> 41:57.372
Yeah, that's right.

41:57.374 --> 41:59.442
But we should at least
keep the ice cream.

41:59.444 --> 42:01.176
Yes, definitely.

42:01.178 --> 42:03.047
I'm so excited about this.

42:05.083 --> 42:06.949
Mom? James?

42:06.951 --> 42:10.285
Hey,
what brings these fair maidens

42:10.287 --> 42:14.622
to our bed chambers
on this fair eve?

42:14.624 --> 42:17.193
Dad,
please don't be weird.

42:17.195 --> 42:19.028
Okay.

42:19.030 --> 42:20.830
No, but seriously we
have something important

42:20.832 --> 42:22.398
we wanna talk
to you guys about.

42:22.400 --> 42:24.266
Okay.

42:24.268 --> 42:27.937
Well, there is this talent show
at Addy's school in two weeks,

42:27.939 --> 42:31.942
and we need your help to get
Dally and Spanky ready for it.

42:31.944 --> 42:33.843
They have been doing so well
with their training

42:33.845 --> 42:36.278
and all we would need help with
is like costumes

42:36.280 --> 42:38.013
and putting the show
together.

42:38.015 --> 42:40.249
We just wanna be more
than a few tricks.

42:40.251 --> 42:41.684
Okay.

42:41.686 --> 42:43.420
Um...

42:43.422 --> 42:44.720
That's a great idea!

42:44.722 --> 42:47.090
Of course, we will help you.

42:47.092 --> 42:48.925
- Thank you!
- Oh!

42:48.927 --> 42:50.627
Also, look.

42:50.629 --> 42:52.430
They have almost
500 followers.

42:52.432 --> 42:54.599
Ooh! Is that good?

42:54.601 --> 42:57.000
Yeah, I mean it's pretty good
for a new page.

42:57.002 --> 42:59.402
Okay, well... Muah.

42:59.404 --> 43:03.208
You and your 500 new followers
get to bed.

43:04.977 --> 43:05.976
Thank you, guys.

43:05.978 --> 43:07.077
Sleep good.

43:07.079 --> 43:08.979
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

43:12.118 --> 43:14.651
Why did you say "yes"?

43:14.653 --> 43:16.254
- They looked so happy.
- Oh.

43:16.256 --> 43:17.788
- Let's go. Come on.
- Yes.

43:17.790 --> 43:19.023
- Come on.
- You two have fun.

43:19.025 --> 43:21.027
Come on, come on.

43:22.228 --> 43:24.262
Come on.
You got this, Dally.

43:24.264 --> 43:25.930
Yeah, hey.

43:29.235 --> 43:30.768
- Look at this.
- That's cute.

43:30.770 --> 43:31.771
Yeah, I like this.

43:34.274 --> 43:36.908
Come on, come on.

43:36.910 --> 43:38.009
No.

44:03.538 --> 44:05.538
Yeah, hey.

44:05.540 --> 44:07.240
Yay, good job!

44:07.242 --> 44:08.243
Here.

44:15.883 --> 44:17.816
That's so cute.
I like that, we'd match.

44:17.818 --> 44:18.817
I do, too.

44:18.819 --> 44:19.753
Yes.

44:21.323 --> 44:22.591
Oh, that's so cute.

44:24.660 --> 44:26.359
Alright.

44:26.361 --> 44:29.197
Now we gotta put it all together
and we have a great show.

44:32.568 --> 44:33.566
- Oh!
- Good girl!

44:33.568 --> 44:34.867
Okay, my turn, my turn.

44:34.869 --> 44:36.202
High five.

44:36.204 --> 44:37.237
Yay!

44:41.743 --> 44:44.478
You look smashing.

44:44.480 --> 44:47.314
Oh, well,
you look pretty good yourself.

44:47.316 --> 44:48.582
You excited
for the girls?

44:48.584 --> 44:49.717
I am. I am.

44:49.719 --> 44:51.185
It's been so nice
feeling like

44:51.187 --> 44:53.187
we've got the family
back together again.

44:53.189 --> 44:56.223
Yeah, it's been a blast
these past couple of weeks, huh?

44:56.225 --> 44:58.225
It has, yeah.

44:58.227 --> 45:00.561
Hey, let's just try
to enjoy tonight, okay?

45:00.563 --> 45:02.696
No stressing about finances
or anything.

45:02.698 --> 45:05.700
Let's just have
a fun family night.

45:05.702 --> 45:07.471
Sounds like a plan,
captain.

45:10.574 --> 45:12.540
Ew, get a room.

45:12.542 --> 45:14.309
This is our room.

45:14.311 --> 45:17.579
- You two look amazing!
- You really do.

45:17.581 --> 45:18.714
Thanks, guys.

45:18.716 --> 45:20.282
Okay.
Are we ready to go?

45:20.284 --> 45:22.149
Yeah, let's get this show
on the road.

45:22.151 --> 45:23.752
- Let's do it!
- Giddy up.

45:23.754 --> 45:24.918
Yee-haw!

45:24.920 --> 45:25.919

You guys are really
getting your money's worth.

50:46.420 --> 50:47.720
What is this,
round 3?

50:47.722 --> 50:49.722
Yes, and I'm gonna ask
for another one,

50:49.724 --> 50:51.123
and get cookies and cream.

50:51.125 --> 50:53.359
All I want is
peanut butter cup.

50:53.361 --> 50:56.730
More and more peanut butter cup.

50:56.732 --> 50:58.229
I am so proud
of you two.

50:58.231 --> 51:01.033
That was quite a show
you put together.

51:01.035 --> 51:03.435
Oh, we couldn't have done it
without you, Mom.

51:03.437 --> 51:05.972
And you, James.

51:05.974 --> 51:08.674
It was a pleasure
to serve you, my lady.

51:08.676 --> 51:12.112
So what do you wanna do
with your prize money?

51:12.114 --> 51:14.848
You wanna go
on a big shopping spree?

51:14.850 --> 51:18.387
Actually, we had
something else in mind.

51:19.922 --> 51:21.056
Oh, no.

51:22.124 --> 51:23.522
Take it, please.

51:23.524 --> 51:25.592
Absolutely not.

51:25.594 --> 51:28.461
This is your money,
you won it.

51:28.463 --> 51:30.864
No, mom.
This our money.

51:30.866 --> 51:32.766
Okay, we all came together
as a family,

51:32.768 --> 51:35.201
and we all had a part
in winning the show tonight.

51:35.203 --> 51:37.004
Me and Ella
already talked about it.

51:37.006 --> 51:39.940
Look, we know that you guys
have been struggling

51:39.942 --> 51:43.144
and Spanky is a burden,
we just want the money to help.

51:50.619 --> 51:52.419
We'll talk about this
later, okay?

51:52.421 --> 51:53.790
Just eat up
your ice cream.

52:15.179 --> 52:16.212
What?

52:18.182 --> 52:19.413
Yeah, I can do that.

52:26.490 --> 52:28.590
Morning, Addy!

52:28.592 --> 52:31.326
- What's going on?
- Addy, this is Mr. Sterling.

52:31.328 --> 52:32.229
Hi, Addy.

52:34.031 --> 52:37.065
Is he here to take away
Spanky?

52:37.067 --> 52:39.334
Uh, l...
let's talk about this inside.

52:39.336 --> 52:41.236
When were you gonna tell me
about this?

52:41.238 --> 52:43.074
Excuse me,
I'll be right back.

52:44.075 --> 52:45.542
Alright.

52:48.146 --> 52:50.012
Addy.

52:50.014 --> 52:51.647
Listen to me.

52:51.649 --> 52:54.350
We had to do this, because
having a horse is not cheap.

52:54.352 --> 52:56.819
But we offered you the money
from the talent show.

52:56.821 --> 52:58.087
And that was
very generous of you,

52:58.089 --> 52:59.521
but it's only gonna
cover expenses

52:59.523 --> 53:01.157
for a couple of months,
if that.

53:01.159 --> 53:04.228
Mom, this is the only thing
I have left from Dad.

53:04.230 --> 53:06.096
- I know.
- Why are you doing this to me?

53:06.098 --> 53:08.065
You're gonna get
to visit Spanky.

53:08.067 --> 53:11.235
He's gonna be very happy
at Mr. Sterling's ranch.

53:11.237 --> 53:12.936
Are they taking him today?

53:12.938 --> 53:14.573
No, not for another week.

53:15.708 --> 53:17.541
Yeah, that's great, thanks.

53:17.543 --> 53:19.777
Addy.

53:24.649 --> 53:26.750
You guys are
something special.

53:26.752 --> 53:27.853
I hope you know that.

53:30.422 --> 53:32.422
I'm not mad at them.

53:32.424 --> 53:34.259
I know they're trying.

53:34.261 --> 53:36.593
But why would they
give you to me

53:36.595 --> 53:39.230
and then take you
away from me?

53:39.232 --> 53:41.431
Why not just tell me
from the start?

53:50.709 --> 53:52.609
Hi.

53:52.611 --> 53:54.279
<i>Hey, you up?</i>

53:54.281 --> 53:56.281
What does it look like?

53:56.283 --> 53:58.817
<i>Okay, someone's in a mood.</i>

53:58.819 --> 54:01.553
<i>Anyway, have you been online
since last night?</i>

54:01.555 --> 54:03.421
No, why?

54:03.423 --> 54:05.423
<i>You guys went viral.</i>

54:05.425 --> 54:08.426
<i>Your videos are blowing up
everywhere right now.</i>

54:08.428 --> 54:10.795
Wait, what? How?

54:10.797 --> 54:13.965
<i>Who cares! Just go look.</i>

54:13.967 --> 54:15.903
Okay, hold on,
hold on, wait.

54:20.373 --> 54:23.108
Oh my God!

54:23.110 --> 54:24.210
Huh.

54:24.212 --> 54:25.546
I can't believe this.

54:26.781 --> 54:28.814
<i>So are you happy?</i>

54:30.651 --> 54:33.886
No, because it doesn't matter.

54:33.888 --> 54:36.522
My parents are giving Spanky
away to some rancher.

54:36.524 --> 54:38.325
<i>What?</i>

54:38.327 --> 54:41.493
<i>But you guys are famous now.</i>

54:41.495 --> 54:44.496
<i>I even found another talent
show for you guys to be in.</i>

54:44.498 --> 54:46.166
<i>Here, I just sent you
the link.</i>

54:46.168 --> 54:47.601
Okay.

54:47.603 --> 54:49.238
<i>Isn't it cool?</i>

54:51.707 --> 54:54.275
Don't you have to like submit
a video or something?

54:54.277 --> 54:56.010
<i>Yeah, what's the big deal?</i>

54:56.012 --> 54:58.611
I am never going to have
enough time

54:58.613 --> 54:59.982
before
they give Spanky away.

55:02.017 --> 55:04.352
<i>Well,
you better get to work then.</i>

55:12.362 --> 55:14.362
Here you go.

55:14.364 --> 55:15.363
Okay, ready?

55:15.365 --> 55:16.364
Down.

55:16.366 --> 55:17.567
Good girl.

55:26.376 --> 55:27.277
Thanks.

55:34.218 --> 55:35.286
There you go.

55:40.891 --> 55:42.293
Here, grab that.

55:43.928 --> 55:45.329
Very clear.

55:47.130 --> 55:48.863
Okay.

55:48.865 --> 55:50.301
Okay.

55:53.938 --> 55:55.306
Okay, ready?

56:00.678 --> 56:03.012
- Oh no. Alright, it's okay.
- Come on.

56:03.014 --> 56:04.715
Let's try again.

56:07.052 --> 56:08.850
- Good job!
- Yay!

56:08.852 --> 56:11.387
- Good job.
- Good job, Spanky.

56:11.389 --> 56:13.922
- Great going, Dally.
- Alright, come on.

56:13.924 --> 56:15.126
One more time.

56:17.594 --> 56:18.727
Oh no, Dally.

56:18.729 --> 56:20.332
Spanky, stop eating.

56:22.000 --> 56:23.766
Come on,
Dally, one more time.

56:23.768 --> 56:26.339
- Yay!
- Come on, Spanky.

56:29.275 --> 56:31.108
Yeah.

56:31.110 --> 56:32.575
Good pony.

56:32.577 --> 56:35.178
One last time.

56:35.180 --> 56:36.480
Go, go, go!

56:40.485 --> 56:41.684
Yay!

56:41.686 --> 56:43.954
- Yay!
- Dally, come here.

56:43.956 --> 56:46.158
- Good job!
- Good job, Dally.

56:47.360 --> 56:49.460
Good job, Dally.

56:49.462 --> 56:51.395
- Good job, girl.
- Good job, Dally.

56:51.397 --> 56:53.497
Nice job, Spanky.

56:53.499 --> 56:55.632
You looked so good.
High five.

56:55.634 --> 56:57.267
Yeah, good girl.

56:57.269 --> 56:58.501
Oh, get it!

56:58.503 --> 56:59.502
Here.

56:59.504 --> 57:00.503
Yeah.

57:00.505 --> 57:01.939
I think they've got it.

57:01.941 --> 57:03.376
And they look pretty good
together, too.

57:10.250 --> 57:11.349
You all set?

57:11.351 --> 57:12.683
Yeah.

57:12.685 --> 57:13.952
Okay.

57:13.954 --> 57:15.487
Action.

57:23.896 --> 57:25.163
Alright.

57:25.165 --> 57:27.499
Okay. Think we got this one.

57:27.501 --> 57:29.501
- Movin' on.
- Good job, girl.

57:29.503 --> 57:30.404
Marcy.

57:32.072 --> 57:33.738
- Marcy?
- What?

57:33.740 --> 57:35.374
Uh, yeah,
where do you want this?

57:35.376 --> 57:37.412
Right here.
Right... right there.

57:47.522 --> 57:49.888
Okay, this is good.

57:49.890 --> 57:52.791
- This is good. Let's roll.
- Oh.

57:52.793 --> 57:54.395
Wow! What's goin' on here?

57:58.534 --> 58:00.699
Hey, guys. Dorian is
helping us make a video

58:00.701 --> 58:02.536
to remember Spanky by
when he's gone.

58:02.538 --> 58:04.837
- Oh, well, that's nice of him.
- Yeah, wow.

58:04.839 --> 58:06.008
Yeah.

58:07.176 --> 58:08.843
Alright, well...

58:10.144 --> 58:11.846
- ...have fun.
- Yeah.

58:23.425 --> 58:25.462
Forecast,
plenty of sunshine...

58:31.568 --> 58:33.233
Are we expecting
someone?

58:33.235 --> 58:35.802
I'm studying for my math test
with Dorian and Marcy.

58:35.804 --> 58:37.804
Don't you remember?

58:37.806 --> 58:39.139
Okay.

58:39.141 --> 58:40.410
Ella,
where are you going?

58:41.478 --> 58:42.644
Just like watching them.

58:46.416 --> 58:48.985
- Hi.
- Hey.

58:53.156 --> 58:56.225
- I'm so ready for this.
- Me, too.

58:56.227 --> 58:58.495
Alright,
we're all set.

59:01.131 --> 59:02.132
Okay.

01:00:02.662 --> 01:00:03.826
Dang!

01:00:03.828 --> 01:00:05.663
That was insane,
Dorian.

01:00:05.665 --> 01:00:07.498
Seriously,
that was so good.

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:10.500
Yeah, you guys
are 100% getting in.

01:00:10.502 --> 01:00:13.671
Cool. You don't think
it's too derivative?

01:00:13.673 --> 01:00:14.938
What?

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:16.105
Never mind.

01:00:17.443 --> 01:00:18.544
Thank you.

01:00:19.778 --> 01:00:21.946
Guys, the video
is due tonight.

01:00:21.948 --> 01:00:23.583
What are you waiting for?

01:00:29.523 --> 01:00:31.556
All we do now
is hope for the best.

01:00:31.558 --> 01:00:33.390
It's all up to
online votes, right?

01:00:33.392 --> 01:00:36.026
Yeah. The top 10
contestants go to LA,

01:00:36.028 --> 01:00:37.897
to the live shows
to compete.

01:01:02.256 --> 01:01:04.024
Look how many likes we have.

01:01:06.728 --> 01:01:09.060
Look, that's a lot, right?

01:01:09.062 --> 01:01:10.363
I don't know.

01:01:10.365 --> 01:01:11.798
I don't know if it's enough.

01:01:13.735 --> 01:01:15.236
Cute.

01:01:16.437 --> 01:01:18.371
Stay, stay.

01:01:18.373 --> 01:01:20.006
Take a selfie.
Get a selfie.

01:01:20.008 --> 01:01:22.742
Hold on,
I'm posting this one first.

01:01:22.744 --> 01:01:24.646
Okay, okay.

01:01:47.902 --> 01:01:49.835
There you are.

01:01:49.837 --> 01:01:52.439
Good morning.

01:01:52.441 --> 01:01:54.641
Addy, this came
for you yesterday.

01:01:54.643 --> 01:01:56.410
I forgot
to give it to you.

01:01:56.412 --> 01:01:57.911
Oh my God!
Addy, open it!

01:01:57.913 --> 01:02:01.148
Look at that.
They know how to talk again.

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:02.883
Is it something
important?

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:04.851
Addy, what are they saying?

01:02:04.853 --> 01:02:06.421
"Dear Addy Thompson,
we are delighted

01:02:06.423 --> 01:02:08.288
to inform you that your
talent show submission video

01:02:08.290 --> 01:02:09.923
has received enough votes
from our viewers

01:02:09.925 --> 01:02:11.458
to satisfy our requirements.

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.427
You are now
one of our top 10 finalists.

01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:15.062
Congratulations. Kelly Banks."

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:16.997
- We got in?
- We got in!

01:02:16.999 --> 01:02:18.501
Yeah, we did it!

01:02:19.835 --> 01:02:21.135
Care to fill us in?

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:23.837
Okay, so here's the deal.

01:02:23.839 --> 01:02:25.473
I was really upset
when I found out

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:26.908
you guys were
gonna get rid of Spanky,

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.777
but then Marcy told us
that our videos

01:02:28.779 --> 01:02:30.345
were blowing up
on the internet

01:02:30.347 --> 01:02:32.246
and that people actually cared
about what we were doing.

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:34.014
Marcy sent us the link
to We Got Talent

01:02:34.016 --> 01:02:36.484
and she wanted us to try it
with Dally and Spanky.

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:39.822
And Dorian helped us with
the submission video and...

01:02:39.824 --> 01:02:42.290
Ta-daa!
We got in!

01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:44.626
And now the top 10
contestants get to go to LA,

01:02:44.628 --> 01:02:47.196
compete live
for the grand prize of...

01:02:47.198 --> 01:02:49.398
$50,000!

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.799
Whoa!

01:02:50.801 --> 01:02:52.534
- Uh!
- When is this all happening?

01:02:52.536 --> 01:02:55.170
In like a week from now.

01:02:55.172 --> 01:02:56.505
Oh!

01:02:56.507 --> 01:02:57.806
Gwen?

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:07.851
I guess
we better call Mr. Sterling.

01:03:07.853 --> 01:03:09.819
Dally and Spanky are going
to Hollywood.

01:03:09.821 --> 01:03:10.722
Yay!

01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:13.823
Come on, come here.

01:03:13.825 --> 01:03:15.761
- Yes!
- Yeah, good girl!

01:03:50.863 --> 01:03:53.064
- Come on, girl.
- Okay.

01:03:54.099 --> 01:03:55.232
Hi!

01:03:55.234 --> 01:03:56.567
Dally and Spanky, right?

01:03:56.569 --> 01:03:58.569
Yes, we are.
I mean...

01:03:58.571 --> 01:04:00.705
They are, but, yeah,
we're all ready to go.

01:04:00.707 --> 01:04:01.773
Great.

01:04:01.775 --> 01:04:03.107
We are so happy
to be here.

01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:04.543
Go for Jocelyn.

01:04:04.545 --> 01:04:06.912
Yeah, okay.
I'll be right there.

01:04:08.047 --> 01:04:08.947
Oh.

01:04:10.216 --> 01:04:12.016
Okay.

01:04:12.018 --> 01:04:13.752
That was a little rude.

01:04:13.754 --> 01:04:16.454
- Welcome to Hollywood.
- Okay, girls, grab a seat.

01:04:16.456 --> 01:04:17.889
Okay.

01:04:17.891 --> 01:04:19.391
Did you guys
watch the videos?

01:04:19.393 --> 01:04:22.928
I saw the dance troupe
and they were amazing.

01:04:22.930 --> 01:04:25.764
- Do you think we have a chance?
- What are you talking about?

01:04:25.766 --> 01:04:27.265
Of course.

01:04:27.267 --> 01:04:29.968
And everybody in here
looking at you well knows it.

01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:31.904
Team Dally and Spanky.

01:04:31.906 --> 01:04:33.841
Team Dally and Spanky.

01:04:58.131 --> 01:05:00.433
I think you two
should get some sleep.

01:05:00.435 --> 01:05:03.202
It's gonna be
a long day tomorrow.

01:05:03.204 --> 01:05:04.770
Hmm.

01:05:04.772 --> 01:05:06.772
I don't know if I'm going
to be able to sleep.

01:05:06.774 --> 01:05:08.274
- Just a little nervous.
- Oh.

01:05:13.682 --> 01:05:16.183
Do you have to deal
with that every night?

01:05:16.185 --> 01:05:17.887
It's the beauty of marriage.

01:05:21.356 --> 01:05:22.290
Mom?

01:05:24.793 --> 01:05:26.927
What if we lose tomorrow?

01:05:26.929 --> 01:05:28.160
Shh!

01:05:28.162 --> 01:05:30.163
I don't even wanna hear that.

01:05:30.165 --> 01:05:32.165
You two have accomplished
more than

01:05:32.167 --> 01:05:33.837
most people
could ever dream of.

01:05:35.471 --> 01:05:37.137
And I want you to know
Dad and I

01:05:37.139 --> 01:05:38.742
have been doing
a lot of talking.

01:05:40.109 --> 01:05:41.876
I want you to think
of Spanky's time

01:05:41.878 --> 01:05:45.846
at Mr. Sterling's ranch
as just a fun extended vacation.

01:05:45.848 --> 01:05:47.581
I'm sure we'll be able
to get him back

01:05:47.583 --> 01:05:49.351
once we get
back on our feet.

01:05:51.655 --> 01:05:54.589
And as for tomorrow,
I want you to...

01:05:54.591 --> 01:05:56.591
To go out there
and show the world

01:05:56.593 --> 01:05:57.928
who Dally and Spanky are.

01:06:00.697 --> 01:06:01.799
Mmm.

01:06:02.934 --> 01:06:04.802
So proud of you.

01:06:30.662 --> 01:06:35.397

Kelly Banks' We Got Talent show!

01:09:26.542 --> 01:09:28.676
You know I... I think
I might start crying right now.

01:09:28.678 --> 01:09:30.078
Oh, well,
here's a tissue, Graham.

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.345
- Thank you.
- And by the way,

01:09:31.348 --> 01:09:32.881
I couldn't agree
with you more.

01:09:32.883 --> 01:09:36.185
Hazel has got talent
and man,

01:09:36.187 --> 01:09:37.853
that song is not
an easy one to do.

01:09:37.854 --> 01:09:39.220
- Not easy at all.
- Mmhmm.

01:09:39.223 --> 01:09:40.423
Let's see her scores.

01:09:43.694 --> 01:09:46.728
Oh, it looks like
everyone agrees with us.

01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:49.564
Lots of 9s and 10s tonight.

01:09:49.566 --> 01:09:50.899
Well, that's it,
I'm gonna call it.

01:09:50.902 --> 01:09:52.466
I can say with confidence

01:09:52.469 --> 01:09:54.637
that a star is born
in sunny Burbank.

01:09:56.407 --> 01:09:57.542
- Amen.
- Great.

01:10:20.331 --> 01:10:21.598
You girls are up next.

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:22.801
- Okay.
- This way.

01:10:45.691 --> 01:10:46.826
We've got this.

01:10:47.961 --> 01:10:49.760
Yeah, I know.

01:10:49.762 --> 01:10:51.295
You guys ready?

01:10:51.297 --> 01:10:52.396
Oh yeah.

01:10:52.398 --> 01:10:53.831
As ready as we'll ever be.

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:56.033
You were so great
out there.

01:10:56.035 --> 01:10:58.668
Thanks. Well, I've been singing
since I was 2.

01:10:58.670 --> 01:11:00.437
Wow, that's amazing!

01:11:00.439 --> 01:11:03.908
How long have you guys
been doing your pony show?

01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:05.509
Um, like a few months.

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:07.346
- Yeah.
- Oh.

01:11:07.348 --> 01:11:09.047
That's great!

01:11:09.049 --> 01:11:10.381
Well, good luck
out there.

01:11:10.383 --> 01:11:12.351
You know,
people love pet shows.

01:11:12.353 --> 01:11:15.556
But judges though,
not so much.

01:11:20.493 --> 01:11:22.927
Um, I'll be right back.

01:11:22.929 --> 01:11:24.395
Can you hold that?

01:11:24.397 --> 01:11:25.332
Addy!

01:11:38.847 --> 01:11:41.047
I'm so sorry, Ella,
but I can't do this.

01:11:41.049 --> 01:11:42.682
You really believe
what she said?

01:11:42.684 --> 01:11:44.549
She was just trying
to intimidate you.

01:11:44.551 --> 01:11:46.319
Well, it worked.

01:11:46.321 --> 01:11:48.587
What I was thinking tryin'
to parade Spanky around

01:11:48.589 --> 01:11:50.522
like it was gonna bring
my dad back.

01:11:50.524 --> 01:11:53.558
Your dad would be
so proud of you.

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:56.095
I feel like that's
why he left you Spanky.

01:11:56.097 --> 01:11:58.197
I just...
I feel so useless.

01:11:58.199 --> 01:12:00.301
What do you mean?

01:12:00.303 --> 01:12:02.236
Look what you did for Spanky.

01:12:02.238 --> 01:12:04.604
And Dally.
And...

01:12:04.606 --> 01:12:06.706
...look what you did for me.

01:12:06.708 --> 01:12:10.777
I feel like I finally have
my big sister back.

01:12:10.779 --> 01:12:13.613
You have got so much talent,
Addy.

01:12:13.615 --> 01:12:15.817
I couldn't have wished
for a better sister.

01:12:20.622 --> 01:12:22.258
You're not so bad yourself.

01:12:26.028 --> 01:12:27.728
I've been looking everywhere
for you two.

01:12:27.730 --> 01:12:29.465
You girls are on
in like 30 seconds.

01:12:33.635 --> 01:12:36.469
Wow, that was so fantastic!

01:12:36.471 --> 01:12:38.272
You guys did awesome!

01:12:38.274 --> 01:12:42.142
Stunning! That performance
was absolutely mesmerizing.

01:12:42.144 --> 01:12:45.213
Well, you know, Tracy,
I think Hazel still has my vote.

01:12:45.215 --> 01:12:48.316
But it's very hard to decide
with so much talent all around.

01:12:48.318 --> 01:12:50.620
Alright, let's turn around
and get your scores.

01:12:54.257 --> 01:12:57.591
Well, looks like you guys
are in 2nd place so far!

01:12:57.593 --> 01:12:59.461
Congrats!

01:12:59.463 --> 01:13:04.466
Up next, we have a sister duo
performing with their dog Dally

01:13:04.468 --> 01:13:06.835
and their miniature horse
Spanky

01:13:06.837 --> 01:13:10.705
for a one-of-a-kind
Dog and Pony show.

01:13:51.116 --> 01:13:53.183
Yeah!

01:13:53.185 --> 01:13:54.086
Right.

01:14:16.608 --> 01:14:17.544
Dally, come here.

01:14:28.121 --> 01:14:29.222
Yay!

01:14:37.363 --> 01:14:38.465
Come on, Spanky.

01:14:45.038 --> 01:14:46.038
Alright, come on,
one more time.

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:46.974
Oh!

01:14:52.713 --> 01:14:53.714
Good pony.

01:15:37.959 --> 01:15:39.093
Come on.

01:16:00.584 --> 01:16:02.116
What do you think, Graham?

01:16:02.118 --> 01:16:04.553
Really, it'd be cruel
not to like those two,

01:16:04.555 --> 01:16:07.657
but what an overload of
cuteness and expertise.

01:17:22.233 --> 01:17:24.635
Good job!

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:29.473
Oh, I love it!

01:17:29.475 --> 01:17:32.945
You girls did amazing!

01:17:37.783 --> 01:17:39.284
Wow, just wow!

01:17:39.286 --> 01:17:41.185
Wasn't that something, Tracy?

01:17:41.187 --> 01:17:44.421
I don't know, Graham, watching
animals is always entertaining.

01:17:44.423 --> 01:17:46.490
But what will
the judges think?

01:17:46.492 --> 01:17:48.058
Will they be impressed
by something

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:49.960
that belongs
on your Facebook feed?

01:17:49.962 --> 01:17:51.763
Well, they certainly
have never seen

01:17:51.765 --> 01:17:53.298
a dog riding a pony
before.

01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:54.965
But it would take someone
with a cold, dead heart

01:17:54.967 --> 01:17:56.934
not to be moved
by that act, Tracy.

01:17:56.936 --> 01:17:59.804
And as you see, the audience
agrees with me again.

01:17:59.806 --> 01:18:02.807
Hmm, that's because they are
just as dumb as you are, Graham.

01:18:02.809 --> 01:18:04.309
Or maybe you're just
a cold-hearted...

01:18:04.311 --> 01:18:05.977
Okay!

01:18:05.979 --> 01:18:08.912
I say let's go take a look
at those scores, shall we?

01:18:08.914 --> 01:18:10.350
Hey, here we go.

01:18:13.086 --> 01:18:14.419
Hey, well,
I'm not great at math,

01:18:14.421 --> 01:18:16.220
but I think
it's safe to say this is

01:18:16.222 --> 01:18:17.989
a close call
between them and Hazel.

01:18:17.991 --> 01:18:21.262
I think Kelly has
the final results now.

01:18:22.997 --> 01:18:26.000
Okay, you girls
did so amazing.

01:18:27.401 --> 01:18:31.336
And our winner is...

01:18:31.338 --> 01:18:33.838
...Hazel Douglas!

01:18:43.685 --> 01:18:45.787
Congratulations, Hazel!

01:18:47.021 --> 01:18:48.690
You did so great!

01:18:50.158 --> 01:18:52.525
Congratulations.

01:18:52.527 --> 01:18:54.594
Let's bring
out top three contestants.

01:18:54.596 --> 01:18:58.065
Come on out, you guys!
You all did so fabulous.

01:19:00.435 --> 01:19:05.540
And let's give it up
one more time for Hazel!

01:19:10.613 --> 01:19:12.114
Good job.

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:16.550
Hey, we could hit
In-N-Out on the way home.

01:19:16.552 --> 01:19:18.819
You guys like that place, yeah?

01:19:18.821 --> 01:19:21.356
You know, I think it's best
we just go straight home.

01:19:22.825 --> 01:19:25.325
Hello, hi, you guys.
How are you doing?

01:19:25.327 --> 01:19:27.228
Well...
We've been better,

01:19:27.230 --> 01:19:29.929
but I think this was
a great adventure for all of us,

01:19:29.931 --> 01:19:31.565
right, girls?

01:19:31.567 --> 01:19:35.503
Oh, you guys did such
an amazing job, you really did.

01:19:35.505 --> 01:19:37.271
Oh, we're grateful
for the opportunity.

01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:40.609
Well, anyway. I didn't just
come by to congratulate you.

01:19:40.611 --> 01:19:43.178
I wanted to introduce you
to my friend Aaron.

01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:45.045
Hey, guys.
Nice to meet you.

01:19:45.047 --> 01:19:47.783
Aaron is a movie producer
who works with the studio,

01:19:47.785 --> 01:19:50.451
and he happened to be
in the audience during our show.

01:19:50.453 --> 01:19:53.422
Yeah, you guys were
just tremendous today.

01:19:53.424 --> 01:19:57.359
Anyway, I will let you guys chat
and congratulations again.

01:19:57.361 --> 01:19:58.693
Bye, everyone.

01:19:58.695 --> 01:20:00.195
Well, I'll talk to you later.

01:20:00.197 --> 01:20:01.296
Alright, sounds good.

01:20:01.298 --> 01:20:03.465
So...

01:20:03.467 --> 01:20:05.670
..how would you guys
like to make a movie?

01:20:07.571 --> 01:20:08.969
We'd love to.

01:20:18.883 --> 01:20:19.950
Everybody ready?

01:20:21.419 --> 01:20:23.018
- Let's get this started.
- So excited.

01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:23.922
I know.

01:20:28.359 --> 01:20:30.428
Spanky, look.

01:20:34.198 --> 01:20:35.531
It's starting. Okay...

01:20:51.550 --> 01:20:53.920
We're rolling, rolling.
Let's start here.

01:20:56.922 --> 01:20:57.823
Come on.

01:21:06.565 --> 01:21:08.298
Yeah.

01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:09.566
Yeah, great.

01:21:09.568 --> 01:21:11.470
And go... well.

01:21:14.574 --> 01:21:16.139
Start going for the...

01:21:16.141 --> 01:21:17.544
Oh, gosh!

01:21:22.548 --> 01:21:24.181
You got an itch?

01:21:25.719 --> 01:21:27.352
Oh, baby.

01:21:27.354 --> 01:21:29.554
Please,
don't bite me or...

01:21:29.556 --> 01:21:31.021
- Dally, this won't...
- Do this way.

01:21:31.023 --> 01:21:32.323
Hey, look
like this way.

01:21:32.325 --> 01:21:33.625
Turn! Dally.

01:21:42.303 --> 01:21:43.835
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:22:03.157 --> 01:22:05.090
Okay, goin' up!

01:22:05.092 --> 01:22:06.093
Oh!

01:22:20.576 --> 01:22:24.244
♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪

01:22:24.246 --> 01:22:27.147
♪ Under my umbrella, ella ♪

01:22:27.149 --> 01:22:29.149
Okay, are you ready?

01:22:29.151 --> 01:22:30.584
- I bet.
- And...

01:22:30.586 --> 01:22:31.920
Hello, Miss Ella.

01:22:34.723 --> 01:22:36.525
My God,
I've been waiting for this all day!

01:22:37.659 --> 01:22:39.025
Wait, let's back up.

01:22:39.027 --> 01:22:40.527
There was a little bit
of noise over there.

01:22:40.529 --> 01:22:42.329
I can tell you
some more tricks.

01:22:44.399 --> 01:22:45.568
Alright, okay.

01:22:50.707 --> 01:22:52.440
- She is terrible!
- Cut.

01:22:52.442 --> 01:22:54.342
Maybe you wanna hang out
with us?

01:22:54.344 --> 01:22:56.944
I could show you
some more tricks.

01:22:56.946 --> 01:22:58.213
Ella,
listen to me.

01:22:59.281 --> 01:23:01.048
Why?

01:23:01.050 --> 01:23:02.850
One more time!

01:23:02.852 --> 01:23:04.218
- Why?
- Still rolling.

01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:06.354
Oh wait, I just looked right
at the camera.

01:23:08.224 --> 01:23:09.791
Stop.
Bloopers.

01:23:09.793 --> 01:23:11.292
Full feeling
and you're setting.

01:23:11.294 --> 01:23:13.394
- Set.
- Camera set.

01:23:13.396 --> 01:23:15.196
- Ai yai yai.
- And...

01:23:15.198 --> 01:23:16.433
- Cut.
- Halt.

01:23:18.302 --> 01:23:20.035
Halt.

01:23:20.037 --> 01:23:22.269
Alright.

01:23:22.271 --> 01:23:23.640
- Mark.
- Alright.

01:23:27.678 --> 01:23:28.946
Mark.

01:23:30.681 --> 01:23:33.315
- Are we rolling?
- Yes.

01:23:33.317 --> 01:23:34.385
You nailed it.
