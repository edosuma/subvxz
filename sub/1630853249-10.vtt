WEBVTT

00:14.715 --> 00:16.350
Oh, come on, you...

00:17.585 --> 00:18.952
Can I gave you a hand?

00:19.087 --> 00:20.788
If I needed a hand,
I'd ask for it,

00:20.921 --> 00:22.456
thank you very much.

00:45.779 --> 00:46.847
There you go, miss. Thanks.

00:49.683 --> 00:51.985
Marion.
How's it going?

00:52.120 --> 00:54.555
Eh. Could be worse.
Brain's still working.

00:54.688 --> 00:56.857
Is it
a pastrami day?

00:56.990 --> 00:58.692
Yeah. Uh, one
and a quarter pounds.

00:58.826 --> 00:59.893
You got it.

01:00.027 --> 01:02.696
Not a pound and a half,
you overshot last time.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.165
Oh. Sorry 'bout that.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.568
What do we
have here?

01:07.701 --> 01:11.205
Extra-sharp
Wisconsin cheddar.

01:11.339 --> 01:13.407
"Extra-sharp," hmm?

01:17.211 --> 01:19.447
Ohh.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.583
You can keep it,
Wisconsin. Ugh.

01:49.743 --> 01:52.112
It wasn't like this
when I came before.

02:05.693 --> 02:07.094
Need some help?

02:07.228 --> 02:08.462
I'm fine!

02:14.067 --> 02:15.803
Are you sure
you don't want
a push?

02:15.936 --> 02:17.205
I'm sure.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.812
What happened
to poor Nippy?

02:24.945 --> 02:26.614
Ah. It was my fault.

02:28.949 --> 02:30.918
I was driving with
the windows open,

02:31.051 --> 02:33.053
you know,
before all this hit.

02:33.187 --> 02:34.788
And, I don't know,
something got into him.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.790
He saw
a cat or something,
but he jumped.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.292
Oh, no.

02:38.426 --> 02:41.495
I pulled right over,
screaming my head off,
"Nippy!"

02:41.629 --> 02:43.964
Ohh.
But he was gone.

02:44.097 --> 02:45.999
Oh, that's terrible.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.501
I hope you find him.

02:48.602 --> 02:49.970
If you could keep
an eye out.

02:50.103 --> 02:51.505
Yeah, I will. Sure.

02:51.639 --> 02:54.242
I-I live right over here
on... On Clementine.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.943
This is my route.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.978
When I can get
this thing going.

03:01.249 --> 03:03.484
Maybe just
a little push.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.488
Well, if you're sure
you don't mind.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.022
Nah. I'm happy
to help.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.169
Okay.
Throw it in neutral.

03:22.303 --> 03:25.005
And one, two, three.

03:28.476 --> 03:29.543
There you go.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.545
Oh, sorry
for the trouble.

03:31.679 --> 03:34.047
Put it back in drive.
Not at all.

03:34.181 --> 03:36.850
Have a nice day.
Yeah, you too.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.486
Hope you find Nippy.

03:38.619 --> 03:39.653
Thank you.

03:43.491 --> 03:46.460
Ohh. What in the world?

03:56.737 --> 03:58.238
How ya doing,
Marion?

03:58.372 --> 03:59.840
Great.
Ah, good.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.509
Are you okay?
Oh, yeah.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.453
Okay, okay, okay.

05:19.587 --> 05:22.289
Actually,
it's my favorite meal
to cook.

05:22.423 --> 05:25.325
Hmm. I like it.
And I think
my secret is...

05:25.459 --> 05:26.894
Ma?

05:27.027 --> 05:29.129
In the kitchen,
Jeffie!

05:29.262 --> 05:30.664
I have a little trick.

05:30.798 --> 05:32.332
I bet
it's the same
we do in my family.

05:32.466 --> 05:33.834
An egg.
I knew it.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.769
And you really work it in.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.705
I mean,
you got to use
your hands.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.072
You are speaking
my language.

05:39.206 --> 05:40.408
Do you cook?

05:40.541 --> 05:42.776
Uh, just
a few favorites,
nothing fancy.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.145
Yeah, simple's best.
I mean, why fuss?

05:45.278 --> 05:49.483
Oh. Jeffie,
this is Mr. Takavic.

05:49.617 --> 05:52.319
Oh, please,
Mr. Takavic
was my father.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.854
Call me Gene.

05:55.556 --> 05:58.926
Don't worry, hon,
he's not an ax murderer.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.394
If he was gonna
chop me to bits

06:00.528 --> 06:01.495
he'd have
done it already.

06:01.629 --> 06:02.663
Right, Gene?

06:06.667 --> 06:10.438
Well, don't just stand there
like a bump on a log, join us.

06:13.340 --> 06:16.309
Sometimes he gets a little
nervous around new people.

06:16.444 --> 06:18.345
Ma...
Well, you do.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.513
Now come on.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.982
Grab a glass
and sit down.

06:33.661 --> 06:35.095
Tell him how
we met, Gene.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.396
Oh, yeah.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.566
Uh, well,
I was looking
for Nippy...

06:38.699 --> 06:39.567
Yeah. His dog,
poor thing.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.001
Well, he ran away.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.070
And Gene here
was putting up posters.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.805
And your mom
was on her way back
from Hansen's.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.107
And my wheels
got stuck in the snow.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.709
Well, that was
before the whole
thing conked out.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.011
Yeah, but Gene here
saved the day.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.214
He even fixed
my dumb scooter...

06:54.347 --> 06:55.348
With duct tape!

06:56.650 --> 06:57.885
Ah.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.420
To Gene.
Come on.

07:00.554 --> 07:01.555
Yeah.
Ahh...

07:05.125 --> 07:05.859
Mm.

07:08.395 --> 07:11.231
So your mom tells me

07:11.364 --> 07:13.033
you're a cab driver?

07:16.003 --> 07:19.372
Have you ever driven
anyone famous?

07:19.507 --> 07:20.841
Oh, he sure did.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.075
Tell him, Jeffie.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.415
Sammy Hagar.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.283
No! The Red Rocker?

07:30.417 --> 07:32.019
Hey, I love him. Hey...

07:32.152 --> 07:35.288
<i>♪ I can't drive 55 ♪</i>

07:35.422 --> 07:36.389
That's it!
Hey!

07:38.091 --> 07:39.927
What was he like?
Big tipper?

07:41.194 --> 07:42.262
I guess.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.432
Mm.
Oh. You know what?
You stay comfy.

07:45.566 --> 07:48.468
I will rescue
this beautiful creation.

07:49.770 --> 07:50.938
Look at that.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.042
Ta-da!

07:55.175 --> 07:56.777
Gene's staying
for dinner.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.027
Dude,
what the fuck?

08:14.161 --> 08:15.629
I know
it's awkward, right?

08:15.763 --> 08:18.766
But you don't have to
call me "Dad." Yet.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.133
I don't know
what this is about,

08:20.267 --> 08:21.669
but all I have to do
is pick up the phone

08:21.802 --> 08:23.336
and it's bye-bye,
Saul Goodman.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.739
Yeah, but you haven't
picked up the phone yet,
have you?

08:25.873 --> 08:27.841
Or tried to
strong-arm me
for cash.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.309
And guess what?
I know why.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.581
Because reward money, blackmail,

08:33.714 --> 08:34.948
that's not gonna
tickle your pickle.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.950
I know what
you really want.

08:37.084 --> 08:38.351
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

08:40.788 --> 08:42.522
You want in the game.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.191
"The game"?
W-What...

08:44.324 --> 08:46.126
What game?

08:46.259 --> 08:48.128
The game.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.363
The one
you've been watching
your entire life.

08:50.497 --> 08:52.700
You got
your nose pressed up
against the glass,

08:52.833 --> 08:54.735
peerin' in while
the big boys play.

08:54.868 --> 08:55.869
Man, speak English.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.470
What the hell
are you talking about?

08:57.605 --> 08:58.706
The game.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.140
It's right there.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.375
You can see it,
but you can't touch it.

09:03.811 --> 09:08.415
The cars,
the clothes,
the cash.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.750
The ladies.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.153
It's about knowing
all the angles,

09:13.286 --> 09:14.688
you know,
putting it all
on the line

09:14.822 --> 09:16.724
and winning big.

09:16.857 --> 09:19.492
But here you are, Jeffie.

09:19.627 --> 09:22.329
Standing outside
with the suckers.

09:22.462 --> 09:24.932
Tryin' to
pay off that cab,
sweatin' the bills,

09:25.065 --> 09:26.466
gettin' older.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.535
It's so close,

09:28.669 --> 09:30.503
but, damn it,
you just can't get in.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.539
Until now.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.808
I can make it happen.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.614
You?

09:41.882 --> 09:43.016
Saul Goodman.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.421
So, here's the deal.

09:48.555 --> 09:51.191
I will show you the game.
And then we're done.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.221

to say thanks. Um...

14:02.775 --> 14:04.644
I'm Gene.
From Cinnabon.

14:04.777 --> 14:06.679
Uh, you called
the EMTs for me

14:06.813 --> 14:08.781
when I...fainted.

14:10.117 --> 14:11.718
Yeah. I remember you.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.386
"Get a lawyer!"

14:13.520 --> 14:16.589
Nick!
Do I detect Cinnabons?

14:16.723 --> 14:18.191
Yeah!

14:18.325 --> 14:20.060
Well, Christ almighty,
get him in here.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.598
I'm sorry about
the lawyer thing.

14:25.732 --> 14:26.666
Just slipped out.

14:30.770 --> 14:31.972
It's a free country.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.686
Hi. Uh, Gene Takavic.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.321

14:48.455 --> 14:51.158
Hey, Gene. I'm Frank.
This is Nick.

14:51.291 --> 14:54.227
Yeah. Nick here, um,
did me a solid,

14:54.361 --> 14:55.996
so, uh...

14:56.129 --> 14:57.597
Well...

15:04.171 --> 15:07.107
Please,

15:07.240 --> 15:09.042
Well, God bless ya.

15:09.176 --> 15:10.410
Well, 9:45.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.512
Nick, you wanna
grab yours to-go?
Sure. Yeah.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.414
He's gotta check the lot.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.416
Yeah.

15:16.549 --> 15:17.550
Thanks.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.687
Uh...

15:20.820 --> 15:22.289
You want to take
a load off?

15:22.422 --> 15:24.357
Grab yourself
a cup of coffee
if you'd like.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.359
Yeah.
Yeah?

15:26.493 --> 15:28.661
Oh.
Okay.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.130
Ohh.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.367
I should not
be doing this.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.578
Hey,
do me a favor,

15:45.712 --> 15:49.182
if you were ever
to cross paths
with my wife, shh.

15:49.316 --> 15:50.383
Oh.

15:50.517 --> 15:51.384
Scout's honor.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.887
Ahh. Oh, man.

15:56.256 --> 15:59.392
I haven't had
one of these
in forever.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.129
Watching my waistline.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.964
Yeah, but every
now and then...
No harm, right?

16:07.600 --> 16:09.402
Oh, wow.

16:11.604 --> 16:12.772
Mmm.

16:24.884 --> 16:28.288
Mmm. Mm-mm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.493
So, did you catch
the game last night?

16:35.362 --> 16:36.429
The game?

16:37.464 --> 16:38.998
What the hell is wrong
with those guys?

16:41.334 --> 16:43.336
I can't even
talk about it.

16:43.470 --> 16:44.937
Mm.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.439
Really thought
this was the year.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.176
Yeah, me too.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.743
Mm.

16:50.877 --> 16:53.780
You know, Texas
wasn't even ranked.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.315
I know.

16:56.283 --> 16:57.850
Play-calling was crazy.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.619
The worst.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.821
Three downs to make
a foot and a half?

17:03.956 --> 17:06.359
How hard can it be?

17:06.493 --> 17:08.761
Well, you can't win
when Martinez
plays like that.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.531
Martinez.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.333
I mean,
what's up with him?

17:14.667 --> 17:15.835
You think
something's off?

17:16.836 --> 17:18.805
Maybe.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.107
Mm.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.975
Next week,
Oklahoma State.

17:23.110 --> 17:25.345
The Okies.
Huh?

17:25.478 --> 17:27.180
Uh, that's what
we called them.

17:27.314 --> 17:30.550
You ever done the drive?
Topeka, Wichita... Nice.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.585
Well,
then you haven't done it.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.053
Can't beat Memorial.

17:34.187 --> 17:35.888
Damn straight.
What do you love most?

17:36.022 --> 17:37.490
Now, that's
a tough one.

17:37.624 --> 17:38.958
You think
Weedon'll come through
on his home turf?

17:39.092 --> 17:40.493
Yeah.
No way!

17:40.627 --> 17:42.495
With that thumb?
Thumb's a dealbreaker.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.864
I'll tell you something.

17:44.997 --> 17:48.168
The Cougar helmet
was the thumb-breaker.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.305
Mmm.
Mm-mm-mmm.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.374
Delicious.

17:54.507 --> 17:55.575
Mmm!

17:59.179 --> 18:00.413
Welp...

18:00.547 --> 18:02.382
I should probably
be heading back.

18:02.515 --> 18:03.716
Well, thanks again.

18:03.850 --> 18:04.984
Oh, it's the least
I could do.

18:05.118 --> 18:06.186
Have a good one.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.554
Come back anytime.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.274
Have a good night, Gene.
Good night, Krista.

19:01.408 --> 19:02.842
Good night.
Good night.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.351
Frank?

19:44.484 --> 19:46.719
Gene, Gene,
the Cinnabon machine.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.121
I could smell ya
coming up the hallway.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.123
Oh, I get that
all the time.

19:51.258 --> 19:52.825
Here you go, guys.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.227
Hey, can I...

19:54.361 --> 19:56.162
Thanks, Gene.
Don't even ask.
Grab a coffee.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.164
That was
one hell of a game, huh?

19:58.298 --> 19:59.699
What were you thinking
at halftime?

19:59.832 --> 20:02.201
Well, uh,
I was thinking,

20:02.335 --> 20:05.037
"Hey, this could, uh...

20:05.171 --> 20:07.073
"This could be
a long one."

20:07.206 --> 20:08.908
And I tell you,
you know who I'm not
bitching about today?

20:09.041 --> 20:11.711
Pelini. Nah.
Pelini. That's...
Yeah, the coach.

20:11.844 --> 20:13.946
You know me.
I go at him when
things are bad,

20:14.080 --> 20:15.648
but when he does
something good,
I'm all about it.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.435
Good night, Gene.
Good night!

20:53.753 --> 20:55.254
They got him in there
for a reason.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.757
Mm-mmm-mmm.
Mmm.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.330
Gentlemen!

21:47.674 --> 21:48.741
I still got it.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.422
Mm-mm-mm-mmm-mmm.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.015
Can I help you, sir?

22:29.148 --> 22:30.349
Oh, yeah.

22:30.483 --> 22:31.584
Uh, no thanks.

22:31.718 --> 22:33.152
I'm just browsing.

22:33.285 --> 22:34.487
Okay. Yeah.

22:44.196 --> 22:49.636
Four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine...

22:53.440 --> 22:54.407
...fourteen...

22:57.109 --> 23:00.813
...fifteen, 17, 18.

23:06.786 --> 23:10.189
Six, seven,
eight, nine, ten.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.468
Two...

23:57.570 --> 24:02.942
Eleven, 12, 13, 14, 15.

24:03.075 --> 24:05.077
All right. And...

24:05.211 --> 24:06.412
Seventeen feet.

24:06.546 --> 24:07.413
Right here.

24:16.556 --> 24:17.824
Ribbon it off.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.058
Come on.

24:19.191 --> 24:20.126
All the way, guys.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.366
Okay.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.569
<i>Check, check,
one, two. One, two.</i>

24:29.702 --> 24:31.403
<i>All right, let's move.</i>

24:31.538 --> 24:33.940
<i>Starting position.
Right down there.</i>

24:37.109 --> 24:38.578
<i>All right, we ready?</i>

24:38.711 --> 24:40.780
<i>And grab your bag!</i>

24:40.913 --> 24:41.948
<i>And go!</i>

24:43.049 --> 24:44.150
<i>That's it!
Move! Move!</i>

24:45.317 --> 24:46.619
<i>Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!</i>

24:46.753 --> 24:48.688
<i>One! Armani suits and run!</i>

24:50.356 --> 24:52.925
<i>Two! Air Jordan
shoes for you!</i>

24:56.228 --> 24:58.698
<i>Three! Linen shirts for free!</i>

25:01.968 --> 25:03.936
<i>Four! Cashmere sweaters
out the door!</i>

25:05.905 --> 25:07.940
<i>Five! Patagonias
to survive!</i>

25:09.709 --> 25:12.111
<i>Six! Swanky sweatsuits
in the mix!</i>

25:12.244 --> 25:14.213
<i>Halt!</i>
Ohh. What?

25:14.781 --> 25:15.882
Too many.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.316
You gotta be precise.

25:17.449 --> 25:19.185
Just three of each.
Why?

25:20.587 --> 25:22.288
And why do I gotta run
around like an asshole?

25:22.421 --> 25:23.489
I already told you.

25:23.623 --> 25:24.657
Three minutes.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.492
Got it?
That's our window.

25:26.626 --> 25:27.860
Yeah, but why
three minutes?

25:29.361 --> 25:30.697
Because at three minutes,

25:30.830 --> 25:32.965
that's when
security sees you
on the cameras

25:33.099 --> 25:35.467
and the cops
haul your ass
to jail, all right?

25:35.602 --> 25:37.469
So let's go.
Wait, there's cameras?

25:37.604 --> 25:39.672
Sure,
there's cameras!

25:39.806 --> 25:41.540
They erase the tapes
every 72 hours.

25:41.674 --> 25:42.875
So that's why you only

25:43.009 --> 25:44.043
take three of each.

25:44.176 --> 25:45.578
And only the pricey stuff.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.714
When the store opens
the next morning,

25:47.847 --> 25:49.248
they won't even know
they were robbed.

25:49.381 --> 25:52.284
By the time
they do inventory,
abracadabra!

25:52.418 --> 25:54.721
No more Jeffie
on the tape, right?

25:54.854 --> 25:58.290
So, three items,
three minutes.

25:58.424 --> 25:59.525
It's easy.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.427
Let's go.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.729
How many of each?

26:02.862 --> 26:04.196
Three.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.532
Pigs get fat,
hogs get slaughtered.

26:06.666 --> 26:07.900
I dunno...

26:10.436 --> 26:11.838
What don't you know?

26:13.706 --> 26:16.042
It's just,
this whole thing...
It seems crazy.

26:16.175 --> 26:18.344
Is this too hot for you?
You know, just say so.

26:18.477 --> 26:19.679
You know what?
Screw it.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.081
"Crazy"?

26:22.214 --> 26:24.050
I'll tell you
what's crazy.

26:24.183 --> 26:25.718
Fifty-year-old
high school
chemistry teacher

26:25.852 --> 26:27.253
comes into my office.

26:27.386 --> 26:31.190
The guy is so broke,
he can't pay
his own mortgage.

26:31.323 --> 26:34.761
One year later,
he's got a pile of cash
as big as a Volkswagen.

26:34.894 --> 26:36.062
That's crazy.

26:37.496 --> 26:38.631
I'll do it.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.033
This sounds good to you?

26:44.336 --> 26:45.537
I think it'll work.

26:45.672 --> 26:47.106
Well, look at you.

26:47.239 --> 26:48.808
You're young.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.410
You're probably, uh,
fast on the feet, huh?

26:51.543 --> 26:53.445
Okay, I-I didn't say
I wouldn't do it.

26:53.579 --> 26:57.950
I just had some questions
about, like, logistics.

26:59.719 --> 27:01.220
Are you in or out?

27:06.458 --> 27:07.559
In.

27:07.694 --> 27:09.395
Okay.

27:09.528 --> 27:10.362
Back to one.

27:12.064 --> 27:14.266
<i>Check, test,
one, two, one, two.</i>

27:14.400 --> 27:17.937
<i>Okay, and ready,
set, action!</i>

27:18.070 --> 27:20.006
<i>Move! Move! Move!</i>

27:20.139 --> 27:22.408
<i>Pick up the pace!
Go! Go! Go!</i>

27:22.541 --> 27:24.944
<i>One! Armani suits and run!</i>

27:25.077 --> 27:27.079
<i>Two! Air Jordan
shoes for you!</i>

27:27.213 --> 27:29.281
<i>Three!
Linen shirts for free!</i>

27:29.415 --> 27:32.251
<i>Four! Cashmere sweaters
out the door!</i>

27:32.384 --> 27:34.486
<i>Five! Patagonias to survive!</i>

27:34.620 --> 27:36.923
<i>Six! Swanky sweatsuits
in the mix!</i>

27:56.575 --> 27:57.643
Barbara?

27:57.710 --> 27:58.110
Yes?

27:59.411 --> 28:02.081
Let's ask maintenance
to give this area a polish.

28:02.214 --> 28:03.783
Got it,
I'll call now.

28:03.916 --> 28:05.151
Thanks.

28:06.252 --> 28:08.020
Okay, then.
Have a good night.

28:08.154 --> 28:09.121
You too.

28:09.255 --> 28:10.857
Excuse me, ma'am?

28:10.990 --> 28:12.658
There's a delivery.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.126
A delivery?

28:17.964 --> 28:19.531
No.

28:19.665 --> 28:20.499
No, no.

28:20.632 --> 28:21.734
Stop.

28:23.269 --> 28:25.204
You are not
leaving that thing
on my loading dock.

28:25.337 --> 28:26.372
No way.

28:28.640 --> 28:31.310
Fourteen twelve
Cottonwood Drive...

28:32.011 --> 28:33.479
Dock... Dock D.

28:33.612 --> 28:34.713
Let me see.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.753
Two-stroke
engine sprayer pumps?

28:40.887 --> 28:42.388
This is
a department store.

28:42.521 --> 28:44.190
Does it look like
we use sprayer
pumps here?

28:45.157 --> 28:46.158
Well, we don't.

28:47.659 --> 28:49.796
I was given
this address, ma'am.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.530
I need to talk
to your supervisor.

28:52.799 --> 28:54.433
Got it. You stay right here.

29:14.686 --> 29:16.923
Dispatch. Steve.

29:17.056 --> 29:18.724
<i>Yes, this is Kathy Deutsch,</i>

29:18.858 --> 29:21.027
<i>I'm the manager
of a Lancaster's in Omaha.</i>

29:21.160 --> 29:23.562
<i>And you guys
just delivered something
that we did not order.</i>

29:23.695 --> 29:25.197
Really?

29:25.331 --> 29:28.434
Your guy brought
a giant wooden crate
onto my loading dock,

29:28.567 --> 29:31.703
seems to be some kind
of spraying system.

29:31.838 --> 29:36.342
The invoice number
is 1-9-6-8-AE35.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.878
Okay, just, uh,
give me a second
to catch up here.

29:39.011 --> 29:41.313
Uh... Uh,
sprayer pump.

29:41.447 --> 29:44.216
Yeah, I think I got it.
Omaha, right?

29:44.350 --> 29:46.552
<i>Yes, but I run
a department store.</i>

29:46.685 --> 29:48.354
<i>We don't sell
anything like that.</i>

29:48.487 --> 29:50.222
<i>Clearly this is a mistake
you need to fix.</i>

29:50.356 --> 29:52.892
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

29:53.025 --> 29:54.660
My boss is gonna just...

29:55.862 --> 29:57.396
Ah, great.

29:57.529 --> 29:59.331
<i>Ricky's booked solid.</i>

29:59.465 --> 30:00.566
Ricky?

30:00.699 --> 30:01.600
<i>He's the driver.</i>

30:05.337 --> 30:08.207
Well, Ricky's just
gonna have to put the
box back on the truck.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.242
<i>Uh, little problem
with that.</i>

30:10.376 --> 30:11.844
<i>Cargo space.</i>

30:11.978 --> 30:13.913
He's got a pickup
at the airport
in an hour.

30:14.046 --> 30:15.647
It's a messy one, too.

30:15.781 --> 30:20.252
It's, uh,
nine hundred pounds
of Spanish mackerel.

30:20.386 --> 30:22.221
Okay. I'm sorry,
but that's not
my problem.

30:22.354 --> 30:24.223
<i>No, I know.
It's just... Wow.</i>

30:24.356 --> 30:26.959
I mean, if he's late,
that's gonna stink.

30:27.093 --> 30:29.328
Pun intended.

30:29.461 --> 30:31.463
Gene?
Everything okay?

30:31.597 --> 30:34.400
Yep. Oh, I'm just, uh,
putting out fires.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.235
It's a delivery issue.

30:36.368 --> 30:37.336
Don't worry. Okay.

30:37.469 --> 30:38.971
I got it.

30:39.105 --> 30:40.672
Sorry.

30:40.806 --> 30:42.674
You still there?
<i>Yes.</i>

30:42.808 --> 30:45.344
Look, I don't know
what to tell you
about your fish issue,

30:45.477 --> 30:47.880
it's just I can't have
a huge box just...

30:48.014 --> 30:50.249
<i>I-I understand. It's just...
I mean, we both have people</i>

30:50.382 --> 30:51.984
we have to answer to, right?

30:53.953 --> 30:55.154
Hey, I've got an idea.

30:55.287 --> 30:57.023
<i>Um, I've got
an extra truck.</i>

30:57.156 --> 30:58.790
<i>I could drive
over there myself.</i>

30:58.925 --> 31:01.360
Great. How long
till you get here?

31:01.493 --> 31:03.862
<i>Well, I'm just over
in Urbandale.</i>

31:03.996 --> 31:07.666
<i>Um, so, if I leave right now,
be there in four hours.</i>

31:07.799 --> 31:09.936
Four hours? No.

31:10.069 --> 31:11.870
<i>No, no, it's fine.
I don't mind the drive.</i>

31:12.004 --> 31:13.805
I'll crank the tunes,
it'll be like old times.

31:13.940 --> 31:16.708
<i>I mean, no, I can't wait
around that long.</i>

31:16.842 --> 31:18.310
<i>We're closing
for the night here.</i>

31:19.811 --> 31:20.812
Oh. Whew.

31:26.352 --> 31:27.686
How's this?

31:27.819 --> 31:28.887
<i>Yeah?</i>

31:29.021 --> 31:30.689
If you promise me that...

31:32.358 --> 31:37.029
Ricky will get back here
by 10:00 a.m. tomorrow...

31:37.163 --> 31:38.830
I'll hold the box overnight.

31:38.965 --> 31:40.199
<i>You would do that?</i>

31:40.332 --> 31:42.501
Oh, my God.
You're a lifesaver.

31:42.634 --> 31:43.769
What's your name again?

31:43.902 --> 31:45.837
<i>Kathy.</i>
Kathy.

31:45.972 --> 31:48.740
Yeah, my guy'll be there,
10:00 a.m. on the dot.

31:48.874 --> 31:50.342
<i>With flowers.</i>

31:50.476 --> 31:53.245
Well, f-flowers
won't be necessary,

31:53.379 --> 31:54.746
but thanks
for the thought.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.349
No, thank you.

32:34.386 --> 32:35.954
G'night, ladies.

32:36.088 --> 32:37.389
'Night.
Good night, Gene.

33:02.048 --> 33:03.149
Gentlemen.
Hey, Gene.

33:03.282 --> 33:05.284
Heya, Gene.

33:05.417 --> 33:07.253
Well, better hit it.

33:07.386 --> 33:09.821
Good luck to Lizzie
on that spelling bee.

33:09.955 --> 33:10.989
She's a little nervous.

33:11.123 --> 33:12.424
Nah, she's gonna
be great.

33:12.558 --> 33:15.161
Yeah.
Hey, Huskers are back.

33:15.294 --> 33:17.763
Ohh.
Probably heard me screaming
all the way in Lincoln.

33:17.896 --> 33:19.198
I was hoarse.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.968
Uh, and Martinez... Ahh.

33:23.102 --> 33:26.172
484 yards? That's
a freshman record! Wow.

33:26.305 --> 33:28.274
You know what?
I love that kid.

33:28.407 --> 33:30.642
Hey, if he and Kinnie
keep it up,

33:30.776 --> 33:32.144
I think they still
got a shot.

33:32.278 --> 33:34.546
Ohh. Your lips
to God's ears.

33:36.082 --> 33:37.449
Ahh. Okay.

33:39.385 --> 33:41.019
Wow. Mmm.

33:43.455 --> 33:44.656
Mm-mm-mmm.

33:48.827 --> 33:50.862
Hm-hmm.

33:50.996 --> 33:52.564
Mm-mm-mmm.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.233
Hello, gorgeous.

33:58.270 --> 33:59.471
Mmm.

34:35.141 --> 34:38.076
One, Armani suits and run.

34:38.210 --> 34:40.512
Armani, Armani, Armani.

34:40.646 --> 34:41.980
Armani.

34:42.114 --> 34:43.048
Armani?

34:43.182 --> 34:44.183
Armani.

34:50.522 --> 34:53.525
Two, Air Jordan shoes for you.

34:57.396 --> 34:58.564
All right.

35:06.372 --> 35:09.074
Three, linen shirts for free.

35:09.208 --> 35:12.278
One, two, three.

35:12.411 --> 35:14.613
Four, cashmere sweaters
out the door.

35:14.746 --> 35:17.549
No. Yes, yes, yes.

35:18.217 --> 35:20.919
One, two, three.

35:21.052 --> 35:25.123
Five, Patagonias to survive.

35:29.228 --> 35:30.429
6,000 more seats.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.464
6,000 more fans.

35:32.598 --> 35:35.133
I don't know.
All those luxury suites?

35:35.267 --> 35:37.569
Start saving now. Hm.

35:37.703 --> 35:39.471
Mm, you see
that interview
with Pelini?

35:39.605 --> 35:41.240
The guy's
feeling his oats.

35:41.373 --> 35:43.074
He can taste it now.

35:43.209 --> 35:45.277
You think he'll ever get
outta Osborne's shadow?

35:45.411 --> 35:47.546
Mm. Osborne...
What a career.

35:47.679 --> 35:48.980
Wow.

35:49.114 --> 35:51.483
I mean, a hall of famer
and a congressman?

35:51.617 --> 35:53.151
Mm. Unbelievable.

35:53.285 --> 35:55.587
Seven, spendy dresses
sent from heaven.

36:01.227 --> 36:02.494
Mm-mm-mmm.

36:02.628 --> 36:04.496
'95 team?

36:04.630 --> 36:06.332
Wow. What a line up.

36:06.465 --> 36:08.800
I mean,
the "I formation."

36:08.934 --> 36:11.303
Well, I'll tell ya,
Pelini could have taken
a page outta that book.

36:11.437 --> 36:13.605
Nine, pricey lingerie is mine.

36:16.041 --> 36:18.310
Ten, calfskin briefcases
for men.

36:19.545 --> 36:21.179
Apples
and oranges,
my friend.

36:21.313 --> 36:22.914
Aw.
Oh, come on.

36:23.048 --> 36:25.817
Osborne had the great
Tommie Frazier.
Frazier. Yeah, sure, sure.

36:25.951 --> 36:27.719
Huh?
Say it with me.

36:27.853 --> 36:31.189
Twelve,
luxury pumps
to un-shelve.

36:31.323 --> 36:33.792
How about
that 44-21 win
against the Buffs?

36:33.925 --> 36:35.894
Ahh. Be still my heart.

36:37.463 --> 36:41.333
Mmm.
Seventy-six-yard pass
to Reggie Baul and...

36:41.467 --> 36:42.801
And never sacked once.

36:42.934 --> 36:45.437
Wow. You have got
quite a memory.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.841
Yeah, well, uh,
I'll tell you what.

36:49.975 --> 36:51.977
I can remember
every stitch
of clothing

36:52.110 --> 36:53.445
I was wearing
during that game,

36:53.579 --> 36:55.146
but ask me what I had
for dinner last night

36:55.281 --> 36:56.848
and
clean slate.

36:56.982 --> 36:58.384
Yeah.
Tell me about it.

37:00.519 --> 37:02.020
Mm.

37:07.859 --> 37:10.028
Well, I tell ya, if you're
not passing the ball,

37:10.161 --> 37:11.229
that's what's
gonna happen.

37:11.863 --> 37:12.864
Mmm.

37:12.998 --> 37:15.367
Eighteen,
Kate Spade's queen.

37:18.003 --> 37:20.171
Nineteen,
Calvin leathers
on the scene.

37:21.507 --> 37:23.342
Twenty, Uggs look funny.

37:27.245 --> 37:30.215
Sure looks pretty,
Huskers red
against that green.

37:30.349 --> 37:31.450
It's like Christmas
out there.

37:37.523 --> 37:40.025
Ahh! Ugh!

37:42.060 --> 37:43.362
You okay?

37:43.495 --> 37:46.432
Mm-hmm. Wrong pipe.

37:46.565 --> 37:48.066
Oh. Oh, okay.

37:49.301 --> 37:52.237
Mmm. Ohh.

37:52.371 --> 37:54.205
So, you think our guys
are gonna move

37:54.340 --> 37:55.707
to the Big Ten
like they're saying?

37:57.242 --> 37:58.610
Big Ten?

37:58.744 --> 37:59.978
Yeah. I mean,
they're just chasing

38:00.111 --> 38:02.247
the, you know,
mighty dollar,
if you ask me.

38:02.381 --> 38:04.983
I mean, both powerhouses,
'course.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.752
But, you know,

38:06.885 --> 38:09.621
you got Oklahoma
and Texas over here.

38:09.755 --> 38:13.625
But Michigan,
Ohio State over there.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.228
I-I don't know.

38:18.397 --> 38:19.465
Guess I like tradition.

38:20.999 --> 38:24.736
Mmm. Mm-mm-mm-mm-mmm-mmm!

38:25.203 --> 38:26.237
So good.

38:26.372 --> 38:28.407
That center. Mm.

38:28.540 --> 38:29.475
Just amazing.

38:29.608 --> 38:31.443
Mm-mm-mmm.

38:31.577 --> 38:33.311
Wow. Mmm.

38:33.445 --> 38:35.481
Oh, God.

38:35.614 --> 38:36.948
What am I doing?

38:38.584 --> 38:39.918
What?

38:40.051 --> 38:42.187
Look at me!
I don't know.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.589
I-I don't know.

38:44.890 --> 38:45.891
Oh, Jesus.

38:46.024 --> 38:46.958
Gene?

38:49.395 --> 38:51.763
Oh, God. You...

38:55.701 --> 38:57.268
You have a wife,
right, Frank?

38:58.269 --> 38:59.104
Well, yeah.
Yeah?

38:59.237 --> 39:00.506
Yeah.

39:00.639 --> 39:01.773
And she's waiting
for you.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.342
Look at me.

39:06.011 --> 39:06.845
I got...

39:07.846 --> 39:09.047
I got no one.

39:11.517 --> 39:13.452
My parents are dead.

39:13.585 --> 39:15.086
Oh.

39:15.220 --> 39:16.688
My brother...

39:22.728 --> 39:23.862
My brother is dead.

39:25.497 --> 39:26.832
I, uh...

39:31.202 --> 39:32.804
I got no wife...

39:34.339 --> 39:36.074
No kids.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.375
No friends.

39:38.477 --> 39:39.845
If I died tonight,

39:41.513 --> 39:42.814
no one would care.

39:44.015 --> 39:45.350
What difference
would it make?

39:45.484 --> 39:46.818
Gene, buddy...

39:47.653 --> 39:49.721
No, I-I-I'm sure

39:49.855 --> 39:51.957
that you
mean a lot to,

39:52.090 --> 39:53.391
you know,
to a lot of...

39:53.525 --> 39:54.660
Lots of people.

39:54.793 --> 39:55.994
If I died tonight...

39:56.127 --> 39:58.630
My landlord would
pack up my stuff.

39:59.631 --> 40:01.066
It'd take him three hours.

40:02.968 --> 40:07.172
And Cinnabon would just
hire a new manager.

40:07.305 --> 40:08.406
Gene who?

40:08.540 --> 40:09.575
Poof!

40:09.708 --> 40:10.876
I'd be gone. I'd be...

40:13.178 --> 40:14.412
A...

40:15.380 --> 40:16.548
A ghost.

40:17.683 --> 40:19.150
Less than a ghost.
I'd be a...

40:19.885 --> 40:22.420
A sha... Shadow.

40:24.890 --> 40:26.825
I'd just be...

40:26.958 --> 40:28.426
Nothing.

40:33.098 --> 40:36.568
I mean, Frank...
What's the point, Frank?

40:42.508 --> 40:45.243
What's the poi...

40:59.758 --> 41:01.893
Ah.

41:02.928 --> 41:05.096
Oh, you...
I'm so sorry.

41:05.230 --> 41:06.998
You didn't
need to hear
any of that.

41:07.132 --> 41:08.634
No, no, no, no, no,
that's... That's okay.

41:08.767 --> 41:10.569
No, that...
That is okay.

41:12.738 --> 41:14.472
Everybody has bad days.

41:14.606 --> 41:16.174
You've felt like this?

41:18.877 --> 41:22.614
No, I mean, not me,
but people.

41:22.748 --> 41:24.315
I-I think
a lot of people.

41:24.449 --> 41:28.253
Yeah, I mean, i-it's just like
life's ups and life's downs.

41:28.386 --> 41:31.256
Yeah.

41:31.389 --> 41:33.291
Hey, you're
not gonna tell
Nick, are you?

41:33.424 --> 41:34.492
Oh.

41:34.626 --> 41:35.927
No, 'course not.

41:37.028 --> 41:39.631
Well, thanks so much
for listening.

41:39.765 --> 41:41.332
Yeah, no, no.
No p... No problem.

43:09.520 --> 43:10.756
I don't know.

43:10.889 --> 43:13.191
I'm thinking maybe
blue or black?

43:13.324 --> 43:14.425
What's the occasion?

43:14.559 --> 43:15.560
My sister's wedding.

43:15.694 --> 43:17.195
Oh, very exciting.

43:17.328 --> 43:18.797
Um, what size
are you?

43:18.930 --> 43:20.699
Usually a 38
or a 40?

43:20.832 --> 43:22.033
Do you want
to try both?

43:22.167 --> 43:23.301
Yeah.
Let's do it.

43:25.737 --> 43:28.439
Sir, do you need help?

43:28.573 --> 43:30.208
I'm good.

43:30.341 --> 43:32.277
Well, Barbara's right here
if you need anything.

43:32.410 --> 43:33.611
Mm-hmm.

43:33.745 --> 43:36.181
Kathy, is this it?
Yes.

43:36.314 --> 43:37.382
Excuse me, ma'am?

43:37.515 --> 43:39.417
Truck's here to pick up
that big box.

43:39.550 --> 43:40.919
Great, thank you.

43:41.052 --> 43:43.121
Uh, the guy
brought flowers.

43:43.254 --> 43:44.622
Really?

44:14.485 --> 44:17.455
Look. Ooh la la!
Ooh la la!

44:19.791 --> 44:21.359
Oh. Check this out.

44:21.492 --> 44:23.094
<i>Buongiorno,</i> ladies!

44:23.228 --> 44:24.162
How much you think
we can get for 'em?

44:24.295 --> 44:26.031
I don't know. Maybe...
Five hundred each?

44:26.164 --> 44:27.298
But shit, man.

44:27.432 --> 44:28.800
Maybe I just
keep 'em for myself.

44:28.934 --> 44:30.501
I've been eyeing
these Jordans.

44:30.635 --> 44:32.103
You guys enjoying
yourselves?

44:34.105 --> 44:35.440
Well, hold onto
that feeling.

44:35.573 --> 44:36.975
'Cause this is it.

44:37.108 --> 44:38.243
Yeah, we know.

44:38.376 --> 44:39.911
Well, in case
you forget...

44:40.045 --> 44:41.279
You transported
stolen goods

44:41.412 --> 44:43.448
with a value exceeding
five thousand dollars.

44:43.581 --> 44:44.950
And the truck
you used to do it

44:45.083 --> 44:47.685
was rented
in Council Bluffs,
across state lines.

44:47.819 --> 44:50.055
You told us to rent
the truck over there...

44:50.188 --> 44:51.522
Theft from
an Interstate Shipment.

44:51.656 --> 44:53.458
Up to ten years.

44:53.591 --> 44:55.693
Transportation
of Stolen Goods.
Another ten years.

44:55.827 --> 44:57.495
Sale of Stolen Goods.
Ten years.

44:57.628 --> 44:59.197
Conspiracy to commit
a federal crime...

44:59.330 --> 45:02.267
Whoa, whoa. "Conspiracy"?
It was your idea.

45:02.400 --> 45:05.336
Yeah. It's called
mutually assured destruction.

45:05.470 --> 45:08.539
So, if I go down,
you go down.

45:09.775 --> 45:10.809
Man, you don't
have to threaten us.

45:10.942 --> 45:13.044
We're all friends here.

45:15.280 --> 45:18.049
I am not your friend.

45:18.183 --> 45:19.550
And if you get greedy
and you decide

45:19.684 --> 45:22.553
to come back for more, don't.

45:22.687 --> 45:24.522
Gene Takavic,
you never heard of him.

45:24.655 --> 45:26.858
The Cottonwood Mall?
You don't go there.

45:26.992 --> 45:28.860
You see me coming,

45:28.994 --> 45:31.296
you cross to the other
side of the street.

45:31.429 --> 45:33.131
Dude...

45:33.264 --> 45:35.500
Now I need you
to say it.
"We're done."

45:38.269 --> 45:40.138
Come on!
Say it.

45:40.271 --> 45:42.540
"We're. Done."

45:42.673 --> 45:44.575
Say it.

45:53.651 --> 45:54.953
We're done.

45:56.988 --> 45:58.189
We're... We're done.

45:59.690 --> 46:00.491
Gene?

46:04.830 --> 46:06.597
Hey, Gene,
I see your car!

46:11.302 --> 46:12.237
Gene?

46:24.615 --> 46:26.551
Well, that's a start.

46:26.684 --> 46:29.120
Looks like your problem
is the master cylinder.

46:29.254 --> 46:31.222
Look at you boys,
hard at work.

46:32.891 --> 46:36.527
Well,
Marion, guys,
I got to get going.

46:36.661 --> 46:38.696
I will take
another look
next time.

46:38.830 --> 46:40.365
Wait a minute.

46:40.498 --> 46:41.933
No, you can't go anywhere
looking like that.

46:42.067 --> 46:44.302
Come on inside
and wash up.

46:44.435 --> 46:45.536
Ma...

46:46.905 --> 46:49.107
Jeffie, don't vex me.
Come on, Gene.

46:49.240 --> 46:50.641
You can help me
with the groceries.

46:50.775 --> 46:52.510
Huh, Gene?
Sounds like a plan.

47:04.422 --> 47:06.324
Nice of you
to help Jeffie with his car.

47:08.960 --> 47:12.563
You might not know it,
but my boy's had
some tough times.

47:12.697 --> 47:17.002
He, uh... He fell in
with a bad crowd
back in Albuquerque.

47:17.135 --> 47:18.836
Albuquerque, huh?

47:20.271 --> 47:22.607
Never been.
Lucky you.

47:22.740 --> 47:25.543
But things
are so much better
for Jeffie here.

47:25.676 --> 47:27.645
Even more so
now that he knows you.

47:28.947 --> 47:30.315
You're a good influence, Gene.

47:31.983 --> 47:33.418
Oh, where's my brain?

47:33.551 --> 47:35.987
I keep forgetting
to ask you about Nippy.

47:38.223 --> 47:39.190
Nippy?

47:39.324 --> 47:40.291
Oh, oh, right.

47:42.427 --> 47:44.095
You're not gonna
believe this, but, uh,

47:44.229 --> 47:47.865
he was with a family
the whole time, just...
Just a few blocks away.

47:47.999 --> 47:49.167
Oh, well,
that's wonderful!

47:49.300 --> 47:51.002
Yeah.
He's in great shape.

47:51.136 --> 47:53.304
So, after all that...

47:54.772 --> 47:56.574
A happy ending.

47:56.707 --> 47:57.708
Oh, well...

48:09.087 --> 48:11.056
Here you go, ma'am.
Thanks.

48:11.189 --> 48:12.523
And looky here.

48:16.594 --> 48:18.363
For you, m'lady.
Thank you.

48:22.233 --> 48:24.669
Hey, Gene, aren't
you taking lunch?

48:24.802 --> 48:26.237
Huh?

48:29.140 --> 48:30.341
Thanks.
