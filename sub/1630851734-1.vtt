00:12.471 --> 00:15.933
MATT SHAKMAN:<i> Welcome</i>
<i>to what is a strange event.</i>

00:16.016 --> 00:20.145
The first live sitcom taping
in Marvel Studios history.

00:20.229 --> 00:21.480
(ALL CHEERING)

00:24.358 --> 00:27.319
I didn't know that I was gonna be able
to do anything like this,

00:27.402 --> 00:29.446
so it just feels like an incredible gift.

00:29.571 --> 00:32.032
Moving through
to the '60s and the '70s now,

00:32.115 --> 00:35.369
<i>and, as we dove into the '80s and '90s,</i>
<i>is really fun.</i>

00:35.452 --> 00:41.041
And then, ending up in a big Marvel,
full widescreen format is the best.

00:41.124 --> 00:44.628
We were first really terrified,
and now I think we're just so excited.

01:02.938 --> 01:06.483
The first time I heard about the concept,
I thought it was brilliant.

01:06.567 --> 01:10.737
<i>We're putting together</i>
<i>so many different genres of television,</i>

01:10.821 --> 01:13.282
and we are putting our own spin on it.

01:13.866 --> 01:16.910
That is something special, baby.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.288
I just think it's gonna be

01:19.371 --> 01:23.250
<i>so shocking, and confusing, and exciting</i>

01:23.333 --> 01:26.753
<i>for our fans to dissect</i>
<i>what we're doing and why,</i>

01:26.837 --> 01:29.173
<i>and for them to try</i>
<i>and get steps ahead of us.</i>

01:29.256 --> 01:34.094
And that's just very cool
and it's very satisfying.

01:34.178 --> 01:36.722
This is for us.

01:36.805 --> 01:39.183
So let me handle it.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.101
What is outside of Westview?

01:41.185 --> 01:45.063
I got a call from Kevin
to come see him in his office.

01:45.147 --> 01:46.690
<i>When I went, "Oh, I'm getting canned."</i>

01:46.773 --> 01:51.111
And I went in, and, much to my surprise,
they pitched this bonkers idea for a show.

01:51.195 --> 01:54.781
And I was immediately in, of course.

01:54.865 --> 01:58.410
And the show has only grown
more bonkers. (CHUCKLES)

02:01.788 --> 02:03.040
You're the new clown?

02:03.582 --> 02:05.250
At least you're already in makeup.

02:07.753 --> 02:09.296
JARVIS: <i>Welcome home, sir.</i>

02:10.214 --> 02:12.925
It's so nice to see you
finally coming out of your shell.

02:13.008 --> 02:15.177
-BETTANY: <i>It's been a crazy ride.</i>
-That was a good one.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.763
Jon Favreau rung me up and...

02:17.846 --> 02:21.141
We had made a movie together
called <i>Wimbledon.</i>

02:21.225 --> 02:22.851
<i>He rung me up and he said,</i>

02:22.935 --> 02:27.856
<i>"I'm making this movie</i>
<i>with Robert Downey, and he's Iron Man.</i>

02:27.940 --> 02:32.361
"And I need sort of
a really boring, personality-less voice

02:32.444 --> 02:34.780
"for the computer that runs his world.

02:34.863 --> 02:38.200
(CHUCKLING)
"And I immediately thought of you, Paul."

02:38.283 --> 02:40.285
Rendering periodic table, sir.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.704
How do you say no
when you're asked so nicely?

02:42.788 --> 02:44.081
(LAUGHS)

02:45.207 --> 02:46.792
Anyway, and it was a great gig.

02:46.875 --> 02:51.505
<i>They'd shot everything</i>
<i>and whatever still needed clarification,</i>

02:51.588 --> 02:55.175
<i>you could always just have JARVIS say,</i>
<i>"The baddies are coming!"</i>

02:55.259 --> 02:57.302
JARVIS:<i> Sir, it appears</i>
<i>that this suit can fly.</i>

02:57.386 --> 02:59.012
Duly noted. Take me to maximum altitude.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.348
BETTANY: <i>And then,</i>
<i>I don't know how the next bit happened.</i>

03:01.431 --> 03:04.726
I guess Joss Whedon had seen me
in some movie,

03:04.810 --> 03:07.396
<i>and figured out a way for me</i>
<i>to actually work for a living,</i>

03:07.479 --> 03:08.897
<i>-if you can call it work.</i>
-(LAUGHS)

03:08.981 --> 03:11.400
So, then that happened.
That was <i>Age of Ultron.</i>

03:11.483 --> 03:12.860
(GLASS BREAKS)

03:17.489 --> 03:18.907
OLSEN: <i>Starting with </i>Ultron,

03:18.991 --> 03:22.494
<i>Marvel really was so excited</i>
<i>to bring Wanda into the MCU.</i>

03:22.578 --> 03:27.749
And was only really
teeing me up for possibilities

03:27.833 --> 03:32.504
<i>that we didn't know if we would actually</i>
<i>fulfill those possibilities or not.</i>

03:32.588 --> 03:35.674
I looked in your head,
and I saw annihilation.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.050
Look again.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.303
So, we would place Easter eggs
in certain places,

03:39.386 --> 03:43.182
whether it's just a glance too long
with Vision or just...

03:43.265 --> 03:46.810
<i>We were trying to play around with that</i>
<i>in </i>Age of Ultron.

03:48.353 --> 03:51.315
<i>I feel like the hand-off</i>
<i>to different directors</i>

03:51.398 --> 03:55.986
<i>have been completely different experiences</i>
<i>for this character specifically.</i>

03:56.069 --> 03:59.573
<i>I think the Russo Brothers</i>
<i>were very honest about,</i>

03:59.656 --> 04:04.328
"You know, I really want this
to be something that you shepherd

04:04.411 --> 04:06.622
<i>"and that you take full ownership of."</i>

04:06.705 --> 04:08.665
<i>And I was like, "Okay." </i>(LAUGHS)

04:08.749 --> 04:13.712
<i>So, I had to choreograph</i>
<i>with this choreographer, Jenny White,</i>

04:13.795 --> 04:16.131
<i>who we brought on in </i>Age of Ultron.

04:16.215 --> 04:18.008
Bring in that energy
and throw it back out.

04:18.091 --> 04:21.803
<i>We just had to figure out</i>
<i>our own place at the same time</i>

04:21.887 --> 04:27.142
while Wanda was trying to figure out
her own place in the Avengers compound

04:27.226 --> 04:29.186
and finding solace in Vision.

04:29.811 --> 04:30.979
Tell me what you feel.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.861
I just feel you.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.948
OLSEN: <i>And I think Paul and I,</i>
<i>we both really believed,</i>

04:41.031 --> 04:46.245
<i>as much as it's fun to be part of the</i>
<i>humor and the playfulness of the Avengers,</i>

04:46.328 --> 04:48.956
we've always... my character specifically,

04:49.039 --> 04:51.625
has also always,
in our relationship together,

04:51.708 --> 04:55.295
<i>we've kind of just created</i>
<i>just an emotional foundation</i>

04:55.379 --> 04:57.965
<i>that doesn't play around</i>
<i>with irony, really.</i>

04:58.048 --> 05:01.009
Which is kind of odd in these movies

05:01.093 --> 05:05.347
when so much is ironic
and funny and fun to watch.

05:05.430 --> 05:09.643
But it's also kind of lovely that it's
told through their strange love story.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.271
We are out of time.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.481
I can't.

05:14.565 --> 05:15.774
VISION: Yes, you can.

05:15.858 --> 05:17.401
It shouldn't be you, but it is.

05:19.444 --> 05:20.654
(BREATHES SHAKILY)

05:23.073 --> 05:24.283
(SIGHS)

05:27.369 --> 05:28.579
I love you.

05:30.581 --> 05:31.582
(SCREAMS)

05:39.464 --> 05:40.465
Hey.

05:40.549 --> 05:42.176
-(CHUCKLES)
-(KISSES)

05:42.885 --> 05:46.638
Now we can begin. Wanda, you pick.

05:46.722 --> 05:48.473
OLSEN: <i>And then moving on to the show</i>

05:48.557 --> 05:51.810
<i>with Mary Livanos, our producer,</i>
<i>and Jac Schaeffer, our creator,</i>

05:51.894 --> 05:55.814
they really honed in on all these things
that were in my head,

05:55.898 --> 06:00.611
and all these inner monologues and threads
and arcs that I kind of just created.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.530
<i>And they just really took it</i>
<i>in such a deep way</i>

06:03.614 --> 06:06.366
<i>and created such beautiful arcs.</i>

06:06.450 --> 06:08.160
Morning, wife! Morning, sons!

06:08.827 --> 06:10.787
Morning, unfamiliar wet animal.

06:10.871 --> 06:11.872
Who's this?

06:11.955 --> 06:15.334
BETTANY: <i>It's such a homage</i>
<i>to the sort of American sitcoms</i>

06:15.417 --> 06:17.836
<i>throughout the 20th century.</i>

06:17.920 --> 06:19.254
What kind of housewife would I be

06:19.338 --> 06:22.716
if I didn't have a gourmet meal for four
just lying about the place?

06:22.799 --> 06:25.052
BETTANY: <i>Jac Schaeffer</i>
<i>has done such a great job.</i>

06:25.552 --> 06:28.680
It's such a little beautiful puzzle box.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.895
SCHAEFFER:<i> I was lucky enough</i>
<i>to be invited to look at the materials</i>

06:34.978 --> 06:36.939
and sort of digest it
and think about it.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.857
<i>And there was so much</i>
<i>that was already there.</i>

06:38.941 --> 06:40.442
<i>This is Kevin Feige's baby.</i>

06:40.526 --> 06:45.113
<i>He loves the show and had some</i>
<i>really distinct ideas and visuals</i>

06:45.197 --> 06:47.157
and things that
they all wanted to achieve.

06:52.955 --> 06:55.207
MARY LIVANOS:<i> Matt Shakman</i>
<i>is just the person to direct</i>

06:55.290 --> 06:58.418
a complicated Rubik's cube
of a show like this.

06:58.502 --> 07:01.505
He runs the Geffen Playhouse back in LA.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.007
<i>He's worked on </i>Game of Thrones.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.801
<i>He's worked on countless sitcoms</i>

07:05.884 --> 07:09.179
<i>and, in fact, starred,</i>
<i>back when he was younger,</i>

07:09.263 --> 07:11.515
<i>in sitcoms as a child actor,</i>

07:11.598 --> 07:14.685
and he is just
the Swiss Army knife of a human

07:14.768 --> 07:16.478
that we need for a show like this.

07:16.562 --> 07:18.814
Hart goes back in. Door slams.

07:19.356 --> 07:20.941
-He goes to the phone!
-(DOOR SLAMS)

07:21.024 --> 07:23.193
We pause here. All right.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.487
And let's continue on
with our ladies over here.

07:25.571 --> 07:28.824
It blew my mind when they pitched me
the concept for the show.

07:29.533 --> 07:33.704
More than just because the idea
is outrageously fun and new,

07:33.787 --> 07:37.165
<i>but also because it felt like it hit</i>
<i>all the parts of my life.</i>

07:37.249 --> 07:40.043
I grew up being on shows from the '80s

07:40.127 --> 07:44.882
like <i>Facts of Life,</i> and <i>Diff'rent Strokes,</i>
<i>Growing Pains,</i> et cetera.

07:44.965 --> 07:48.343
But I've also directed a lot of
large-scale spectacle.

07:48.427 --> 07:52.598
<i>And so, the idea that there existed</i>
<i>a project in the Marvel Universe,</i>

07:52.681 --> 07:55.142
<i>which I'm also an enormous fan of</i>

07:55.225 --> 07:58.812
<i>and dressed up like superheroes from</i>
<i>the Marvel comic books when I was a kid</i>

07:58.896 --> 08:00.314
<i>until they told me I had to stop,</i>

08:00.397 --> 08:03.775
<i>the idea that I could combine</i>
<i>all these things that I've always loved</i>

08:03.859 --> 08:07.029
<i>into one crazy project</i>
<i>was almost too hard to believe.</i>

08:07.112 --> 08:08.197
It's too good to be true.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.865
All right, ready, Janell?

08:09.948 --> 08:11.533
-Yeah.
-All right, let's do it.

08:19.374 --> 08:20.375
And action!

08:20.876 --> 08:22.336
SCHAEFFER: <i>We're starting in the 1950s,</i>

08:22.419 --> 08:26.548
<i>so it was always our dream</i>
<i>that if we did a true multi-camera show,</i>

08:26.632 --> 08:27.966
we would have a live audience.

08:28.050 --> 08:30.469
<i>And we knew it was a risk,</i>
<i>we knew it would be an expense,</i>

08:30.552 --> 08:31.720
<i>almost an indulgence,</i>

08:31.803 --> 08:35.265
<i>but for the actors, for the energy,</i>
<i>and for the crew,</i>

08:35.349 --> 08:37.059
<i>it will be really exciting.</i>

08:37.142 --> 08:39.978
-I've been playing to the audience, so...
-(LAUGHS)

08:40.062 --> 08:43.232
You tell me where the camera is,
and I'll start playing to the camera.

08:45.567 --> 08:49.321
SHAKMAN: <i>So you're on our sitcom stage</i>
<i>for the first episode.</i>

08:49.404 --> 08:52.366
Over there is Vision's office,
where he works,

08:52.449 --> 08:54.493
and he works for a guy named Mr. Hart.

08:54.576 --> 08:58.121
Mr. Hart and his dear lady wife,
Mrs. Hart. (HUFFS)

08:58.205 --> 09:00.290
That's what I just said.
What's wrong with you, son?

09:00.374 --> 09:03.001
-Have you got a screw loose?
-Oh, no, sir, screws all tight, sir.

09:03.085 --> 09:08.590
And then over here, right to your right,
is the house where Wanda and Vision live.

09:08.674 --> 09:12.052
This is their kitchen, over here,
this beautiful blue kitchen.

09:12.135 --> 09:15.222
<i>But when you see it on the show,</i>
<i>it'll be in black and white,</i>

09:15.305 --> 09:17.516
<i>so you won't get to see the color of it.</i>

09:17.599 --> 09:19.935
And then over here is their living room.

09:20.018 --> 09:25.440
So what's a single gal like you doing
rattling around this big house?

09:25.524 --> 09:27.901
Behind you is our live audience seating.

09:27.985 --> 09:29.862
<i>We wanted it to feel period,</i>

09:29.945 --> 09:32.322
<i>so that's why we have</i>
<i>the old wooden chairs</i>

09:32.406 --> 09:35.367
<i>and we've matched the railings</i>
<i>and how it all looks,</i>

09:35.450 --> 09:38.245
<i>because so much of it is about</i>
<i>the audience's experience.</i>

09:38.328 --> 09:40.789
Kevin Feige and I had a lovely lunch
with Dick Van Dyke

09:40.873 --> 09:43.166
shortly before we started
pre-production on the show,

09:43.250 --> 09:46.378
<i>so we could really get in touch</i>
<i>with how they did it</i>

09:46.461 --> 09:50.674
<i>and to be as authentic as we could,</i>
<i>not just in how it would look and feel,</i>

09:50.757 --> 09:52.551
<i>but in how it was put together,</i>

09:52.634 --> 09:54.636
<i>the style, the way they rehearsed,</i>

09:54.720 --> 09:56.889
<i>the way they approached</i>
<i>blocking and shooting.</i>

09:56.972 --> 09:59.850
SCHAEFFER: Wanda would technically
go to a quick change.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.351
She's not gonna do it now.

10:01.435 --> 10:04.313
We'll get the living room dressed.
It's happening.

10:04.396 --> 10:08.609
Then we would light the candles
right at the very end, and we would go.

10:08.692 --> 10:10.694
<i>The Dick Van Dyke Show</i> was theater.

10:10.777 --> 10:11.862
They put it up.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.364
They shot it once
in front of the audience,

10:14.448 --> 10:16.116
like a play, all the way through.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.910
You can feel it when you watch it.

10:17.993 --> 10:20.370
<i>The audience is in it,</i>
<i>like when they're in the theater.</i>

10:20.454 --> 10:21.830
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

10:21.914 --> 10:25.334
<i>The adrenaline, the audience,</i>
<i>and the actors feed off of each other.</i>

10:25.417 --> 10:27.669
<i>That creates something you can't imitate.</i>

10:27.753 --> 10:29.713
That's why we're going
to these great lengths.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.173
Our actors have been wonderful.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.759
I'm a little anxious
about the whole live...

10:33.842 --> 10:39.723
I haven't been in front
of a live audience since 1884.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.016
-Oh, is that right? Oh.
-Yeah.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.519
So, I'm a little anxious
about the whole thing.

10:43.602 --> 10:45.062
Yeah, I would be too.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.105
Still, I just, you know...

10:47.189 --> 10:49.107
Hundred-plus years ago.

10:49.191 --> 10:51.443
-Hundred-plus years ago.
-That's a long time.

10:53.028 --> 10:56.114
MAN: Welcome to <i>WandaVision.</i>
Thank you so much, guys.

10:56.198 --> 10:58.075
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

10:58.158 --> 10:59.868
We're so excited to have you guys.

10:59.952 --> 11:02.079
We've been working hard the last two weeks

11:02.162 --> 11:03.705
on making this happen for you all.

11:03.789 --> 11:08.252
If you guys can give us all the laughter
and all the natural reactions you have

11:08.335 --> 11:10.754
to what we're doing,
we would be most grateful.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.798
Then you will probably hear yourself,

11:12.881 --> 11:15.092
especially if you're one
of those loud laughers...

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

11:16.260 --> 11:18.178
...when you actually
watch the show later on.

11:18.262 --> 11:21.682
I would love to introduce you
to the characters you'll meet today.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.517
-David Lengel.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

11:23.600 --> 11:24.810
Asif Ali.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.520
Debra Jo Rupp.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.021
Fred Melamed.

11:28.105 --> 11:29.648
Kathryn Hahn.

11:29.731 --> 11:32.276
The Vision himself, Paul Bettany.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.195
And, as Wanda Maximoff, Elizabeth Olsen!

11:35.279 --> 11:36.822
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

11:38.615 --> 11:40.784
OLSEN: <i>I mean, I've done theater before,</i>

11:40.868 --> 11:44.037
but shooting a TV show
in front of a live audience

11:44.121 --> 11:47.040
was like a strange meta experience for me

11:47.124 --> 11:49.710
because I grew up on the <i>Full House</i> set

11:49.793 --> 11:52.963
watching these live tapings on Fridays,

11:53.046 --> 11:57.634
<i>never thinking that that would ever be</i>
<i>a form of reality for me.</i>

11:57.718 --> 11:59.052
Guess who?

11:59.136 --> 12:00.846
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

12:00.929 --> 12:02.931
Is that my host behind me?

12:03.015 --> 12:04.641
-It certainly is!
-(SIGHS)

12:04.725 --> 12:06.935
-Lovely to make your acquaintance.
-Yes! (CHUCKLES)

12:07.019 --> 12:10.397
OLSEN: <i>Doing sitcom gave me</i>
<i>so much joy every day.</i>

12:10.480 --> 12:13.400
<i>I think it gave all of us</i>
<i>so much actual joy.</i>

12:13.483 --> 12:14.651
It's really different.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.486
-High-octane.
-It's very authentic,

12:16.570 --> 12:21.992
you know, late '50s sitcom,
and it feels very different.

12:22.075 --> 12:25.120
<i>You have to swing for the fences</i>
<i>and hope that you...</i>

12:25.204 --> 12:26.663
OLSEN: <i>We're playing for an audience.</i>

12:26.747 --> 12:29.291
<i>I feel like in the Marvel films,</i>
<i>it's a cinematic universe,</i>

12:29.374 --> 12:31.627
<i>and this we're playing for laughs.</i>

12:31.710 --> 12:33.754
I've never been allowed to be funny.

12:33.837 --> 12:36.423
This is my first time getting
to be funny as Wanda.

12:36.507 --> 12:37.716
What a gas.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.635
I'm very funny.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.678
-She is enormously funny.
-I'm very funny.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.472
I think I have another idea.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.767
-SHAKMAN: And...
-And then I change.

12:46.850 --> 12:48.810
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

12:51.188 --> 12:53.690
BETTANY: <i>Every member of the crew</i>
<i>was dressed in costumes.</i>

12:53.774 --> 12:55.567
<i>Everybody got into the spirit of it.</i>

12:55.651 --> 12:59.488
<i>And then the audience came in,</i>
<i>and we just went for it.</i>

12:59.571 --> 13:04.284
<i>It was nerve-racking, but I think</i>
<i>it was so rewarding and so funny.</i>

13:04.368 --> 13:05.619
<i>Us running backstage,</i>

13:05.702 --> 13:09.790
bumping into me, or Kathryn Hahn,

<i>Everybody's getting ready</i>
<i>behind doors to come out.</i>

13:13.126 --> 13:14.878
<i>And it was so much fun.</i>

13:14.962 --> 13:17.089
-(OBJECTS CLATTERING)
-Oh, my!

13:17.172 --> 13:18.423
HAHN: <i>That was just a dream.</i>

13:18.507 --> 13:21.176
The costumes are so fabulous.

13:21.260 --> 13:23.387
Mayes, the designer, is such a genius.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.930
That dress!

13:25.013 --> 13:30.727
Yes, the dress! It's... It's so...
It's Sokovian, is what it is! Yes!

13:31.353 --> 13:34.648
It is my favorite period for clothes

13:34.731 --> 13:37.860
<i>because it shows off a waist</i>
<i>if you have a waist.</i>

13:37.943 --> 13:40.362
<i>I have a waist. I have no limbs.</i>

13:40.445 --> 13:42.865
I'm very short, but I have a waist,

13:42.948 --> 13:45.033
so I really like the '50s.
So, that was great.

13:45.117 --> 13:47.744
<i>I kind of like the hair</i>
<i>and I have a magnificent hat.</i>

13:47.828 --> 13:51.498
<i>They had a little table with a whole</i>
<i>bunch of hats, and I just went,</i>

13:51.582 --> 13:53.208
<i>"Could I have that hat, please?"</i>

13:53.292 --> 13:54.918
And it was perfect.

13:55.002 --> 13:59.214
<i>But the '50s undergarments</i>
<i>are not the most comfortable things,</i>

13:59.298 --> 14:00.799
<i>but they help with your posture.</i>

14:00.883 --> 14:03.760
Yeah, I got my Spanx on.
My lifts in my heels.

14:03.844 --> 14:06.388
I've got my Spanx on.
I've got my flats on.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.640
-Ready to go.
-But I'm ready emotionally.

14:08.724 --> 14:10.100
You wanna talk about your butt?

14:10.184 --> 14:13.103
-Yeah, I did, for a second.
-I wanna talk about my dress first.

14:13.187 --> 14:16.064
Um, it makes me have better posture.

14:16.148 --> 14:19.318
And it makes me wanna
walk like this and...

14:19.401 --> 14:21.945
I have exactly the same thing,
but with my fake butt.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.280
-With your fake butt.
-Yeah,

14:23.363 --> 14:25.908
it makes me stand properly,
and wanna do this too.

14:25.991 --> 14:27.075
-This?
-Yeah.

14:27.159 --> 14:29.995
We knew that when we started this show,

14:30.078 --> 14:35.125
the way that we were going to
sell it authentically to an audience

14:35.209 --> 14:38.253
<i>would be with every level of recreation.</i>

14:38.337 --> 14:40.714
<i>So, that includes the camera lenses,</i>

14:40.797 --> 14:44.510
<i>that includes the set decoration,</i>
<i>era-accurate lighting.</i>

14:44.593 --> 14:46.178
SHAKMAN: <i>Jess Hall, who's a brilliant DP,</i>

14:46.261 --> 14:49.640
<i>looked at old original prints</i>
<i>of these television shows,</i>

14:49.723 --> 14:51.183
and he was able to try to match

14:51.266 --> 14:54.436
<i>how closely as we could possibly get</i>
<i>to what it looked like then.</i>

14:54.520 --> 14:55.604
(LAUGHS)

14:55.687 --> 14:57.648
You truly are a pioneer!

14:57.731 --> 14:59.149
SHAKMAN: Action!

15:00.317 --> 15:02.027
Freeze! Swap!

15:05.405 --> 15:06.406
Action!

15:06.490 --> 15:07.699
(GASPS) Oh, no, too much!

15:07.783 --> 15:11.286
We wanted to make sure we approached it
with authenticity and not parody,

15:11.370 --> 15:14.331
and to that end, we wanted
to shoot it the way they shot it.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.709
That means visual effects that would
have been done as special effects.

15:17.793 --> 15:20.254
Luckily, Dan Sudick,
our special effects coordinator,

15:20.337 --> 15:22.798
<i>when I first had my call with him,</i>
<i>when I started this</i>

15:22.881 --> 15:24.633
<i>and I laid out this idea,</i>

15:24.716 --> 15:26.802
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>if he was going to like the idea</i>

15:26.885 --> 15:30.013
or if he'd be, "What're you talking about?
I blow things up!"

15:30.097 --> 15:31.723
He loved it. He started laughing.

15:31.807 --> 15:34.810
<i>He said, "I came up under the guys</i>
<i>who did</i> Bewitched.

15:34.893 --> 15:36.019
<i>"They were my mentors.</i>

15:36.103 --> 15:38.647
<i>"And so, I started my career</i>
<i>doing things on wires.</i>

15:38.730 --> 15:40.524
<i>"I know how to do it. It's a lot of fun."</i>

15:40.607 --> 15:43.235
<i>And so, we have him and his team</i>

15:43.318 --> 15:47.239
<i>doing really complicated puppeteering gags</i>
<i>with wires and rods,</i>

15:47.322 --> 15:50.784
<i>and they're spending just as much time</i>
<i>on that as they are blowing things up.</i>

15:50.868 --> 15:52.244
How can I be of assistance?

15:52.327 --> 15:56.039
Well, the chicken is no longer a chicken,
and the lobsters just flew the coop

15:56.123 --> 15:57.875
so the steak is the last man standing.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.793
OLSEN: <i>I went to theater school.</i>

15:59.877 --> 16:01.962
<i>You study screwball comedies.</i>

16:02.045 --> 16:05.007
You study film noir style of acting,

16:05.090 --> 16:07.509
you feel so stupid
when you're in college. You're like,

16:07.593 --> 16:09.595
"When will I ever do this?
No one makes this."

16:09.678 --> 16:14.057
<i>And so, getting to use all those tools</i>
<i>that you have somewhere in you.</i>

16:14.141 --> 16:15.851
(EXCLAIMS)

16:15.934 --> 16:18.854
Something that I don't really get to do.

16:18.937 --> 16:21.315
-Now, that's romantic.

16:21.398 --> 16:24.568
OLSEN:<i> I think the '50s was the hardest</i>
<i>for me because it was like a warm up.</i>

16:24.651 --> 16:26.445
<i>Once it clicked, it was a blast.</i>

<i>I should've been on a sitcom</i>
<i>all these years.</i>

16:36.079 --> 16:38.582
I... (LAUGHS) I just loved it.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.959
<i>I should have prefaced,</i>
<i>I'm a very shallow person,</i>

16:41.043 --> 16:44.588
so I really rely on people...
(CHUCKLES) people applauding.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.131
-Yes!
-Thank you very much!

16:46.215 --> 16:48.342
-Thank you!
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS AND CHEERS)

16:50.302 --> 16:51.386
Thank you!

16:52.471 --> 16:53.514
MAN: All right!

17:01.730 --> 17:04.816
Part of the challenge
in producing a show like this

17:04.900 --> 17:09.488
is that we really are making one giant
movie in the way that we shoot.

17:09.571 --> 17:13.742
<i>Each day, each week, we're shooting</i>
<i>pivotal moments of the series,</i>

17:13.825 --> 17:18.121
<i>we have to make sure that</i>
<i>the larger story, as a whole, is seamless.</i>

17:18.205 --> 17:23.210
OLSEN: <i>We really created all of</i>
<i>these different characters in the town.</i>

17:23.293 --> 17:24.920
<i>And we have our core cast.</i>

17:26.839 --> 17:29.216
Raspberry or cheese-filled?

17:29.299 --> 17:31.635
Oh, neither for me, thank you.
I don't eat food.

17:31.718 --> 17:36.932
OLSEN: <i>We got the Davids.</i>
<i>We have Asif. We have Emma.</i>

17:37.391 --> 17:38.392
MRS. HART: What brought you here?

17:38.475 --> 17:41.937
How long have you been married?
And why don't you have children yet?

17:42.020 --> 17:43.814
So grateful we have Debra Jo,

17:43.897 --> 17:46.233
<i>who is sitcom-gold</i>

17:46.316 --> 17:48.986
<i>and gets to be a part in our wacky show.</i>

17:49.069 --> 17:53.115
My, um, great nephew basically said

17:53.198 --> 17:56.618
if I did not take the job,
he would never visit me again,

17:56.702 --> 17:58.829
so, I... Well, here I am.

17:58.912 --> 18:04.042
She loved getting to film some of the more
Marvel-y stuff that we did in the finale.

18:04.126 --> 18:07.588
<i>She just thought it was fabulous. </i>(LAUGHS)

18:07.671 --> 18:09.256
I got to do this thing.

18:09.798 --> 18:12.259
Oh, my God! I got to do this thing
where you...

18:12.342 --> 18:13.594
I don't know what it's called.

18:13.677 --> 18:16.555
<i>It's a body scan, okay?</i>
<i>And so you stand...</i>

18:16.638 --> 18:18.140
<i>I took pictures. It's amazing.</i>

18:18.223 --> 18:20.767
But I won't show them to anyone, Marvel.

Kathryn Hahn.

18:27.941 --> 18:30.736
<i>I don't know how I went so long</i>
<i>never working with her.</i>

18:30.819 --> 18:33.071
<i>I've had the greatest time.</i>

18:33.155 --> 18:35.073
You're, like, a monologue early, Kathryn.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.158
I was feeling left out.

18:36.241 --> 18:40.662
OLSEN:<i> The journey with her</i>
<i>consistently throughout the decades</i>

18:40.746 --> 18:44.458
<i>and how the Nosy Neighbor is so prominent.</i>

Spoiler alert!

18:46.084 --> 18:48.587
OLSEN: <i>She nailed all of the layers</i>

18:48.670 --> 18:51.798
<i>that were required of her</i>
<i>and then went beyond.</i>

-SHAKMAN: One more! Still rolling.
-Ready?

18:55.219 --> 18:57.387
This character is like
a blooming onion to me.

18:57.471 --> 19:01.058
I mean, the fact that I was able
to start on the outside

19:01.141 --> 19:03.769
and kind of move into the center

19:03.852 --> 19:07.856
<i>as the episodes go on</i>
<i>was, like, such an actor's dream.</i>

19:07.940 --> 19:10.526
I keep saying
it was like a Tracey Ullman...

19:10.609 --> 19:11.902
Like a Tracey Ullman special.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.404
Well, I was just on my way to Jazzercise

19:14.488 --> 19:18.992
when I heard your brand-new
bundles of joy were on a sleep strike.

19:19.076 --> 19:20.786
HAHN: <i>And the fact that her true center</i>

19:20.869 --> 19:24.706
<i>was this fantastical,</i>
<i>incredible witch, was like...</i>

19:25.207 --> 19:28.544
<i>Who gets to do that?</i>
<i>I remember when it was pitched to me...</i>

19:28.627 --> 19:31.296
It's so exciting to be able
to say this out loud to somebody

19:31.380 --> 19:34.132
'cause I have not been able
to say it to anybody. Um...

19:34.216 --> 19:36.593
<i>But when it was pitched to me, I was like</i>

19:36.677 --> 19:39.513
<i>I could not imagine</i>
<i>a part in the Marvel Universe</i>

<i>that I would have wanted to play more.</i>

-Good times!
-SHAKMAN: And cut!

19:59.491 --> 20:01.201
-Did you hear that?
-No.

20:01.285 --> 20:04.830
It was like a...
a chattering sound, like...

20:07.666 --> 20:08.667
Yeah.

That's my new ice maker,
built right into the fridge.

20:11.962 --> 20:13.672
-Oh!
-(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

20:13.755 --> 20:15.215
You're fancy.

20:15.299 --> 20:20.262
I have wanted to be in the MCU
since the MCU debuted.

20:20.345 --> 20:23.807
<i>I didn't even know</i>
<i>what I was auditioning for.</i>

20:23.891 --> 20:27.102
<i>We all know Marvel is very top secret.</i>

20:27.186 --> 20:29.396
<i>And I was just sent some sides.</i>

20:29.479 --> 20:32.900
I think it was the '70s episode.
So, I was very confused.

20:32.983 --> 20:36.236
<i>It didn't say it was '70s,</i>
<i>but it's high farce.</i>

20:36.320 --> 20:39.865
And I was like,
"What do I do with this? I'm not sure."

20:39.948 --> 20:43.493
Because it's not Marvel
as my mind can process.

20:43.577 --> 20:45.913
And so they sent notes like,

20:45.996 --> 20:48.874
"Just overact. It's okay, just go for it.

20:48.957 --> 20:51.710
"We don't care that you don't feel
that it's grounded.

20:51.793 --> 20:53.378
"That's not what we're looking for."

20:53.462 --> 20:54.796
So, I was like, "Okay."

20:54.880 --> 20:58.675
And I did some very great overacting.

20:58.759 --> 21:00.093
Oh, sugar.

21:00.928 --> 21:02.429
He hired me!

21:02.513 --> 21:04.139
Oh! (CHUCKLES)

21:04.223 --> 21:06.266
Wanda! I landed a promotion.

21:06.350 --> 21:09.770
And now that I've gone all corporate,
I need some office supplies.

21:09.853 --> 21:12.731
I just didn't know,
and I was like, "Okay."

21:12.814 --> 21:14.983
And I let it go for, like, two weeks

21:15.067 --> 21:18.445
because you can't hold these things
too close to your heart

21:18.529 --> 21:20.697
'cause you will get heartbroken
so many times.

21:20.781 --> 21:24.159
<i>But this time, there was no heartbreak.</i>

21:24.243 --> 21:27.329
<i>They called, and they were like,</i>
<i>"Hey, you got the part."</i>

21:27.412 --> 21:30.249
And I'm like, (GASPS)
"What part? What's the part?"

21:30.332 --> 21:33.168
(LAUGHS) I went, "What is it?"
But it's Marvel. Okay.

21:33.669 --> 21:36.046
<i>Before they even told me what it was,</i>

21:36.129 --> 21:38.423
<i>I said to my agent, I was like,</i>

21:38.507 --> 21:40.384
<i>"Oh, my gosh, what if it's Monica Rambeau?</i>

21:40.467 --> 21:43.136
"What if it's Monica Rambeau?"

21:43.220 --> 21:46.682
And then it was Monica Rambeau,
and I lost it.

21:46.765 --> 21:49.977
And I practically tried
to jump off a set of stairs

21:50.060 --> 21:52.479
'cause I thought I could fly.
I was so excited.

21:53.856 --> 21:56.900
<i>So, when we leave</i> Captain Marvel,
<i>Monica is a young girl.</i>

21:56.984 --> 21:59.403
<i>She's got her whole life ahead of her.</i>

21:59.486 --> 22:00.904
-You have to go!
-Monica!

22:00.988 --> 22:04.032
You've a chance to fly the coolest mission
in the history of missions.

22:04.116 --> 22:07.661
You'll give it up to sit on the couch
and watch <i>Fresh Prince</i> with me?

22:07.744 --> 22:09.538
I just think you should consider

22:09.621 --> 22:12.207
what kind of example
you're setting for your daughter.

22:12.291 --> 22:15.085
PARRIS: <i>And when we pick up</i>
<i>with her in</i> WandaVision,

22:15.169 --> 22:19.506
<i>we find out she now works for S.W.O.R.D.,</i>
<i>as a astronaut,</i>

22:19.590 --> 22:25.512
and I feel like we've gotten to a really
great origin story for Monica.

22:28.515 --> 22:32.144
<i>Having the opportunity to play</i>
<i>Monica Rambeau is truly an honor,</i>

22:32.227 --> 22:39.151
and to have a Black female superhero
be on a screen is monumental.

22:39.234 --> 22:41.236
(ALL GRUNTING)

22:42.946 --> 22:45.282
Why didn't anyone tell me the plan?

22:48.577 --> 22:53.874
It's been so amazing to bring Darcy back,
especially in kind of an unexpected way.

22:53.957 --> 22:58.504
<i>You know, the last time we saw Darcy,</i>
<i>she was still Jane Foster's intern</i>

22:58.587 --> 23:00.255
<i>and kind of her friend.</i>

23:00.339 --> 23:01.757
<i>We weren't sure what's going on.</i>

23:01.840 --> 23:04.301
Apparently, she's been going to college
this whole time.

23:04.384 --> 23:06.261
And now she's an astrophysicist.

23:06.345 --> 23:09.932
My equipment registered
an extremely high level of CMBR. That's...

23:10.015 --> 23:12.226
Relic Radiation
dating back to the Big Bang.

23:12.309 --> 23:15.062
Yeah, entwined was a broadcast frequency.

23:15.145 --> 23:17.689
So I had your goons pick me up
a sweet vintage TV.

23:17.773 --> 23:19.483
And when I plug this bad boy in,

23:19.566 --> 23:22.236
the cathode ray tube inside
plucked the signal out of the air

23:22.319 --> 23:24.905
and decoded it
just like in the olden times.

23:24.988 --> 23:26.532
<i>Voilà,</i> sound and picture.

23:26.615 --> 23:29.409
DENNINGS: <i>Randall Park,</i>
<i>obviously, is Jimmy Woo,</i>

23:29.493 --> 23:33.247
<i>and it's been really fun to</i>
<i>kind of have us together in scenes.</i>

23:33.330 --> 23:35.541
<i>They kind of have us with Teyonah Parris.</i>

23:35.624 --> 23:39.002
There's a lot of dark, serious drama,

23:39.086 --> 23:41.505
and it's fun to kind of
have that little break.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.131
You can't go back into the Hex.

23:43.215 --> 23:44.299
Worst case scenario,

23:44.383 --> 23:47.719
Wanda removes my free will
and puts me in ultra-low-rise jeans.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.765
I feel like it's like a family.

23:51.849 --> 23:57.020
It's like a big family. Just to be
a member of the family, it's really cool.

23:57.604 --> 24:00.983
<i>I mean, when I did</i> Ant-man and the Wasp,
<i>I was just happy to be there.</i>

24:01.066 --> 24:02.568
<i>I thought it was gonna be a one-off.</i>

24:02.651 --> 24:04.319
Your school has rules, right?

24:04.403 --> 24:06.280
Like, you can't draw on the walls.

24:06.363 --> 24:08.323
Well, your daddy went to Germany

24:08.407 --> 24:10.534
and drew on the walls
with Captain America.

24:10.617 --> 24:14.997
And that was a violation of Article 16,
paragraph 3 of the Sokovia Accords.

24:15.080 --> 24:18.959
Just to have Jimmy come back
is such a thrill for me

24:19.042 --> 24:21.712
<i>because I just love the character so much.</i>

24:21.795 --> 24:25.132
<i>To have so much of the character</i>
<i>we established in</i> Ant-man and the Wasp

24:25.215 --> 24:29.011
<i>with the magic and the tendency</i>
<i>to want to connect with people</i>

24:29.094 --> 24:33.599
and tell stories about his life,
even when it's not necessarily asked for.

24:33.682 --> 24:37.561
Like all those little things, little seeds
that we planted in <i>Ant-man and the Wasp,</i>

24:37.644 --> 24:40.939
they all kind of get to blossom
in <i>WandaVision.</i>

24:41.023 --> 24:44.776
This isn't a missing person's case,
Captain Rambeau, it's a missing town.

24:45.277 --> 24:47.779
Population 3,892.

24:48.947 --> 24:51.116
Why haven't you gone inside
to investigate?

24:51.617 --> 24:52.951
'Cause it doesn't want me to.

24:56.330 --> 25:00.042
Tonally, <i>WandaVision</i> runs the gamut.

25:00.125 --> 25:02.294
I can't even keep up myself sometimes.
(CHUCKLES)

25:02.377 --> 25:04.254
I'm like, "Which world are we in now?"

25:08.592 --> 25:12.304
OLSEN: <i>For the first episode,</i>
<i>it's the '50s, and it's silly humor,</i>

25:12.387 --> 25:15.265
<i>but it was like really great</i>
<i>physical comedy,</i>

25:15.349 --> 25:19.311
and that bleeds into the '60s,
the second episode, which is <i>Bewitched.</i>

25:19.394 --> 25:22.940
Just mind your P's and Q's
and you're gonna do just fine.

25:23.023 --> 25:24.733
OLSEN: <i>The tone doesn't change too much.</i>

25:24.816 --> 25:26.318
Darling! Oh!

25:26.401 --> 25:30.197
I think we still allow her to just
become more modern of a woman

25:30.280 --> 25:32.199
instead of trying to play the housewife.

25:32.282 --> 25:36.245
Well, thank you for giving me
the strength and the courage.

25:36.328 --> 25:39.540
OLSEN: <i>Thing that we loved so much</i>
<i>in the '50s and in the '60s,</i>

25:39.623 --> 25:42.084
<i>between the marriages in those shows,</i>

25:42.167 --> 25:45.379
is that they were like really funny
and really honest,

25:45.462 --> 25:47.756
<i>and, like, lovely and beautiful</i>
<i>and felt in love.</i>

25:47.840 --> 25:50.175
-Should we put our heads together?
-SHAKMAN: Very cute.

25:50.259 --> 25:52.094
OLSEN:<i> And then we get into the'70s</i>

25:52.177 --> 25:54.388
<i>and it just becomes</i>
<i>this, like,</i> Brady Bunch

25:54.471 --> 25:58.225
<i>kinda creepily, like,</i>
<i>not grounded anymore.</i>

25:58.851 --> 26:01.144
Strangest thing
just happened outside with...

26:01.228 --> 26:02.521
Whoa, Nelly!

26:02.604 --> 26:05.524
BETTANY: <i>It's a surprise initially</i>
<i>that she got pregnant.</i>

26:05.607 --> 26:07.526
We didn't know that that was possible.

26:07.609 --> 26:12.155
<i>It's a magical moment because she's,</i>
<i>sort of, suddenly six months pregnant.</i>

26:12.239 --> 26:14.491
SHAKMAN: If you could
lean in as much as...

26:14.575 --> 26:16.034
I have a belly in front of me.

26:16.118 --> 26:20.956
Her pregnancy is progressing
at an alarming speed. (LAUGHS)

26:21.039 --> 26:23.542
You're at about four months now.
Is that right?

26:24.835 --> 26:26.795
OLSEN: I was so excited to have an episode

26:26.879 --> 26:32.092
where I went through every single stage
of my pregnancy in one day.

26:32.176 --> 26:35.012
That was fabulous. (LAUGHS)

26:35.095 --> 26:37.431
It was so perfect and funny.

26:38.432 --> 26:39.558
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

26:39.641 --> 26:40.851
Vis...

26:40.934 --> 26:42.227
Yes, dear?

26:42.311 --> 26:43.937
I think my water just broke.

26:44.021 --> 26:47.691
We're doing this bit where I'm trying
to hide that I'm pregnant.

26:47.774 --> 26:51.069
<i>And so Monica is over, Teyonah's over.</i>

26:51.153 --> 26:55.866
<i>And I'm switching all these coats</i>
<i>on and off, like, magically.</i>

26:55.949 --> 26:59.620
And I'm in the kitchen and everything's
kind of going bonkers in the kitchen.

26:59.703 --> 27:02.206
I'm trying to hide my belly from her.

27:02.289 --> 27:05.834
<i>And so, I keep magically changing</i>
<i>all of my coats.</i>

27:06.919 --> 27:10.672
So, we'd have to freeze. And then someone
would come on and put on my coat,

27:10.756 --> 27:13.258
then I'd have to freeze again,
then I'd have a contraction.

27:13.926 --> 27:17.179
<i>And there's a moment where</i>
<i>I had to do a double take</i>

27:17.262 --> 27:20.724
and I kept making it like a triple take,
and a quadruple take. (CHUCKLING)

27:20.807 --> 27:24.144
I just kept, like, amping it up each time.

27:24.228 --> 27:27.147
<i>And it was the moment</i>
<i>when Matt came up to me and he said,</i>

27:27.231 --> 27:29.149
<i>"Okay, let's try and keep it...</i>

27:29.233 --> 27:32.611
<i>"I think we're doing too much now,</i>
<i>let's try and keep it to a double take."</i>

27:32.694 --> 27:35.030
And it was the thing
that Matt keeps saying, like,

27:35.113 --> 27:36.782
"Go further, go further!"

27:36.865 --> 27:38.909
And I think that was
when I laughed so hard

27:38.992 --> 27:41.495
because he was telling me to stop.

27:41.578 --> 27:44.623
Vision ran to get the doctor.
He'll be back soon.

27:44.706 --> 27:46.708
BETTANY:<i> Baby's born, and I miss it.</i>

27:46.792 --> 27:50.504
But I'm there for the second baby,
and then, "Oh, my God, they're twins!"

27:51.672 --> 27:55.717
So, yeah, we have twins,
and, uh, they're confusing, too,

27:55.801 --> 27:59.888
because they're born babies,
but very quickly, they're toddlers.

27:59.972 --> 28:01.348
Where are the twins?

28:02.432 --> 28:03.934
-Mommy?
-Daddy?

28:06.436 --> 28:08.272
Wha-- Did y--

28:09.106 --> 28:13.569
And then, very quickly, they are,

28:13.652 --> 28:15.737
you know, sort of ten years old.

28:15.821 --> 28:18.365
We don't think you'll be old enough

28:18.448 --> 28:21.994
to properly care for an animal
until you're at least...

28:22.077 --> 28:23.078
(WHISPERS) Ten.

28:24.288 --> 28:26.331
Ten years old. (CHUCKLES)

28:26.832 --> 28:28.166
SHAKMAN: Look at each other.

28:30.043 --> 28:33.297
-Well, now, hang on there a minute...
-Wait, no, no, no.

28:33.380 --> 28:35.841
VISION: ...you young whippersnappers.
WANDA: No, no, no!

28:35.924 --> 28:37.551
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-(GASPS)

28:37.634 --> 28:40.179
Let's just hope
this dog stays the same size.

28:44.725 --> 28:48.312
This is the '80s, yeah.
So we designed one basic layout,

28:48.395 --> 28:50.898
<i>and then we've just changed it</i>
<i>through the decades.</i>

28:50.981 --> 28:56.028
<i>So, this is still the </i>Dick Van Dyke<i> set,</i>
<i>inspired by </i>Dick Van Dyke<i> kitchen,</i>

28:56.111 --> 28:57.779
<i>but now this is the '80s</i>

28:57.863 --> 29:00.199
inspired by <i>Full House</i>
and <i>Family Ties...</i>

29:00.282 --> 29:02.409
<i>Growing Pains,</i>
shows that we loved from the '80s.

29:02.492 --> 29:03.493
-(BABIES CRYING)
-Now, I know

29:03.577 --> 29:05.287
parents aren't supposed to take shortcuts,

29:05.370 --> 29:08.040
but I think this situation
calls for one, don't you?

29:08.123 --> 29:09.958
SHAKMAN: <i>It's funny now</i>
<i>when you look back at it,</i>

29:10.042 --> 29:14.338
<i>it's a beloved generation</i>
<i>and it's also a self-parodying era as well</i>

29:14.421 --> 29:17.216
<i>because you look at the hair</i>
<i>and the clothes and we all wonder,</i>

29:17.299 --> 29:18.842
"We really thought that was cool?

29:18.926 --> 29:21.053
"How did we ever go outside
looking that way?"

29:21.136 --> 29:23.055
It's almost like we're on a date.

29:23.138 --> 29:24.556
-Almost.
-(CHUCKLES)

29:24.640 --> 29:26.725
With two really cranky chaperones.

29:26.808 --> 29:28.018
(BOTH LAUGH)

29:28.101 --> 29:32.606
My memories of the '80s, as a '90s child,

29:32.689 --> 29:37.236
is that I still got to wear
these beautiful vests and things like this

29:37.319 --> 29:40.822
and had lots of beautiful hats
with big flowers on them.

29:40.906 --> 29:41.949
I just missed it,

29:42.032 --> 29:47.162
but the '80s were a horrible time
of style and hair.

29:47.913 --> 29:51.375
But I really actually am partial
to this wig, I have to say.

29:51.458 --> 29:52.584
-I'm...
-MAN: It's fabulous.

29:52.668 --> 29:54.253
I feel like I'm filled with secrets.

29:56.630 --> 29:59.132
OLSEN: <i>At the end</i>
<i>of the episode in the '80s,</i>

29:59.216 --> 30:00.676
<i>to Wanda's surprise,</i>

30:00.759 --> 30:01.927
she gets a knock at the door.

30:02.010 --> 30:04.972
It was not something
that she consciously did.

30:05.055 --> 30:07.850
<i>And so she's very confused by it.</i>

30:07.933 --> 30:10.727
<i>And the knock on the door</i>
<i>is her brother, Pietro.</i>

30:10.811 --> 30:13.438
But he looks different
because it's Evan Peters. (CHUCKLES)

-TOMMY: No! Ow!
-Get over here!

30:14.773 --> 30:17.234

30:17.317 --> 30:18.986
-Come on!
-(LAUGHTER)

30:19.069 --> 30:22.990
OLSEN: <i>Like, the cool uncle,</i>
<i>who's coming in to stir things up.</i>

30:23.073 --> 30:24.575
Right on, little dude!

30:24.658 --> 30:26.118
Chip off the old Maximoff block.

30:26.201 --> 30:27.369
You've got super speed!

30:27.452 --> 30:28.495
-TOMMY: I do?
-Yeah!

30:28.579 --> 30:30.539
OLSEN: <i>And that's the trope he uses</i>

30:30.622 --> 30:33.542
<i>as part of his relationship</i>
<i>to the sitcom land.</i>

30:33.625 --> 30:35.836
I can't believe
what a bad influence you are.

30:35.919 --> 30:37.337
Who beefed in your borscht?

30:38.297 --> 30:40.591
I'm just trying to do my part. Okay?

30:40.674 --> 30:43.010
Come to town,
create tension with the brother-in-law,

30:43.093 --> 30:45.637
stir up trouble with the rugrats,
and give you grief.

30:45.721 --> 30:49.224
I mean, that's what you wanted, isn't it?

30:50.017 --> 30:51.518
What happened to your accent?

30:51.602 --> 30:52.978
What happened to yours?

30:54.104 --> 30:56.607
I'm thrilled. I'm such a huge fan
of the Marvel Universe.

30:56.690 --> 30:58.984
So, I'm, like...
I'm just excited to be here.

30:59.067 --> 31:03.655
<i>It's, like, the character</i>
<i>is so funny and meta,</i>

31:03.739 --> 31:05.616
<i>and an interesting way to do it.</i>

31:05.699 --> 31:07.743
<i>When Kevin was telling me about it,</i>
<i>I was like,</i>

31:07.826 --> 31:10.787
"Oh, that sounds awesome,
and hilarious, and so weird."

31:10.871 --> 31:13.916
Long lost bro get to squeeze
his stinkin' sister to death or what?

31:13.999 --> 31:15.501
(TV AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

31:16.084 --> 31:18.170

<i>from which to observe</i>

41:35.454 --> 41:36.580
<i>We're in the Marvel world,</i>

41:36.663 --> 41:40.459
so in many ways, you'd expect we would
start with something a bit more stylized

41:40.542 --> 41:42.753
and, sort of, you know, sci-fi.

41:42.836 --> 41:45.005
<i>But we wanted to make it</i>
<i>a little more realistic,</i>

41:45.088 --> 41:46.715
<i>so we started with ideas</i>

41:46.798 --> 41:51.512
<i>of what kind of military response is there</i>
<i>to a disaster, for example,</i>

41:51.595 --> 41:53.597
<i>if it were a chemical attack,</i>

41:53.680 --> 41:55.807
<i>or nuclear attack, or something like that.</i>

41:55.891 --> 41:59.728
<i>And they actually have</i>
<i>these response teams called CBRNs,</i>

41:59.811 --> 42:01.063
<i>which go out and deal with</i>

42:01.146 --> 42:04.107
<i>chemical, biological, radiological</i>
<i>and nuclear threats.</i>

42:04.191 --> 42:05.817
So it's sort of inspired by that.

Now, that said, the building behind me
is a complete hybrid, it isn't...

42:40.060 --> 42:43.522
<i>and space-science people,</i>

42:43.605 --> 42:46.525
and then,
there's my little desk back there.

42:46.608 --> 42:48.527
They gave her her own little corner,

42:48.610 --> 42:54.199
um, where she's basically
cracked the "the magic."

42:54.283 --> 42:58.495
So, you're saying the universe created
a sitcom starring two Avengers?

43:00.038 --> 43:01.582
It's a working theory.

43:01.665 --> 43:04.126
Darcy discovers that there's

43:04.209 --> 43:08.505
basically an old television signal
emanating from the Hex,

43:08.589 --> 43:09.715
<i>from the anomaly.</i>

43:09.798 --> 43:13.760
<i>And she goes, and she grabs an old TV</i>
<i>with a piece of rabbit ears on it,</i>

43:13.844 --> 43:17.055
<i>and she picks up the TV show that</i>
<i>Wanda's broadcasting out from the Hex.</i>

43:17.139 --> 43:23.562
<i>So, what we do is, in each period</i>
<i>that Wanda iterates within the Hex,</i>

43:23.645 --> 43:25.898
<i>we bring in those period TVs.</i>

43:25.981 --> 43:29.860
<i>So you see late '50s, '60s, '70s,</i>
<i>and so on.</i>

43:30.652 --> 43:34.531
Everything might look fake in the TV,
but everything in there is real.

43:34.615 --> 43:36.408
WORTHINGTON:
<i>What's fun is just the contrast.</i>

43:36.491 --> 43:38.952
We started in this very,
sort of, light sitcom world,

43:39.036 --> 43:41.955
which I had never designed before,
so that was fun.

43:42.039 --> 43:45.667
<i>But then,</i>
<i>to then dive right into, sort of,</i>

43:45.751 --> 43:48.837
<i>straight-ahead MCU style,</i>

43:48.921 --> 43:51.256
<i>visual style, acting style,</i>
<i>script, and all that,</i>

43:51.340 --> 43:54.218
<i>just is delightful after all of that,</i>
<i>in a way,</i>

43:54.301 --> 43:57.095
just because, you know,
"Is this all in the same movie?" It is.

43:57.179 --> 43:59.932
Which is great,
but just the design challenges

44:00.015 --> 44:03.310
of having to go from that to this,
that's really fun.

44:06.063 --> 44:10.192
<i>We're at the town square</i>
<i>which is in Hollywood,</i>

44:10.275 --> 44:14.029
<i>so basically, we see that</i>
<i>in six periods pretty extensively.</i>

44:14.112 --> 44:16.990
<i>So much of it is a design challenge</i>
<i>to get all of that right,</i>

44:17.074 --> 44:20.077
<i>to, sort of, express the period,</i>
<i>it's sort of unprecedented.</i>

44:20.160 --> 44:21.370
(APPLAUSE)

44:23.580 --> 44:26.333
<i>Part of the challenge is that</i>
<i>we don't have a shooting schedule</i>

44:26.416 --> 44:29.044
<i>that allows us to shoot for two days,</i>
<i>go away for two days,</i>

44:29.127 --> 44:31.338
<i>turn it around, repaint, come back.</i>

44:31.421 --> 44:33.674
We're doing overnight changeovers.

44:33.757 --> 44:38.011
<i>Which means that we have to basically</i>
<i>define all of the design changes,</i>

44:38.095 --> 44:39.805
<i>all the pieces you're gonna bring in,</i>

44:39.888 --> 44:42.933
<i>design them, build them, paint them,</i>
<i>prefit them probably,</i>

44:43.016 --> 44:44.685
<i>so you know exactly what you're doing,</i>

44:44.768 --> 44:48.397
<i>and everything comes in</i>
<i>almost like LEGO in a certain way.</i>

44:48.480 --> 44:50.691
<i>All these parts come in</i>
<i>and go up very quickly,</i>

44:50.774 --> 44:55.404
<i>'cause you've only got, maybe, 12 hours</i>
<i>to complete this turnaround.</i>

44:57.114 --> 44:58.949
ALL: "For the children!"

45:16.675 --> 45:19.636
OLSEN:<i> The experience of doing the finale</i>

45:20.262 --> 45:23.432
when Wanda, she has to
run through town square,

45:23.515 --> 45:26.143
<i>and she's looking for Agnes, or Agatha,</i>

45:27.019 --> 45:30.731
<i>and all of the people in the town</i>
<i>start to wake up,</i>

45:30.814 --> 45:34.193
<i>and surround her, and crowd her almost,</i>

45:35.194 --> 45:36.945
<i>like, begging her to let them go.</i>

45:37.029 --> 45:40.324
-I can't take this anymore, Wanda, please.
-(VOICES OVERLAPPING)

(SCREAMS)

45:45.913 --> 45:47.289
(WAILS)

45:47.372 --> 45:51.418
It was a very long sequence.
It had quite a climax.

45:51.502 --> 45:54.087
AGNES: I mean,
who is the boss here, Wanda?

45:55.422 --> 45:57.508
Heroes don't torture people.

45:58.175 --> 46:02.429
OLSEN: <i>Getting to do a wide like that,</i>
<i>it feels like a piece of theater.</i>

46:02.513 --> 46:06.850
It felt really satisfying
to do emotionally, I think.

46:06.934 --> 46:09.019
<i>And it just felt epic, like the...</i>

46:09.102 --> 46:13.148
<i>There's some moments when these movies</i>
<i>just feel like so cinematic on the day,</i>

46:13.232 --> 46:16.068
and that just felt really grand.

46:16.151 --> 46:17.402

46:22.115 --> 46:23.909
-(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
-MAN: Run!

46:27.079 --> 46:28.997
What's so special about this script

46:29.081 --> 46:31.959
is that you don't actually know
what is coming from where,

46:32.042 --> 46:34.127
<i>and who is actually the bad person,</i>

46:34.962 --> 46:37.089
<i>and when someone has ulterior motives,</i>

46:37.172 --> 46:39.216
<i>and what's actually happening.</i>

46:39.299 --> 46:42.553
So, sometimes you feel like,

46:42.636 --> 46:44.972
"Well, Wanda is the bad...
She's the villain.

46:45.055 --> 46:49.017
<i>"She has turned</i>
<i>all of these people's lives upside down.</i>

46:49.101 --> 46:50.477
<i>"She's the villain."</i>

46:50.561 --> 46:55.524
Then, you find out that, well,
Agnes is pretty terrible. (CHUCKLES)

46:56.316 --> 47:01.113
<i>She's got her own thing</i>
<i>that she's been brewing the entire time,</i>

47:01.196 --> 47:05.951
<i>and kinda counteracting,</i>
<i>counter-magicking Wanda.</i>

47:06.034 --> 47:09.997
And then you have, um, Hayward,

47:10.873 --> 47:15.460
he's pretty not a very good person.
(CHUCKLES)

47:15.544 --> 47:19.339
<i>And he's got his own agenda</i>
<i>that's throwing...</i>

47:19.423 --> 47:21.592
<i>Everyone has their own agenda,</i>

47:21.675 --> 47:24.261
<i>and what's great is that at some point,</i>

47:24.344 --> 47:26.680
<i>you see it all clash and blow up</i>

47:26.763 --> 47:29.725
into an epic superhero fight,
might I say. (CHUCKLES)

47:31.518 --> 47:34.646
Last one to town square
is a walking pair of mom jeans.

47:34.730 --> 47:36.440
-...burden!
-(GRUNTS)

47:36.523 --> 47:37.774
(GRUNTS)

47:37.858 --> 47:40.444
Usually, I'm like one of
the only flyers. (LAUGHS)

47:40.527 --> 47:43.113
Like, I'm the only one on wires often.

47:43.197 --> 47:46.867
<i>That is something I do a lot</i>
<i>in these films.</i>

47:46.950 --> 47:48.869
(LAUGHTER)

47:49.745 --> 47:51.705
I mean, it looks like a blast.

47:51.788 --> 47:54.833
OLSEN:<i> And so,</i>
<i>I feel like it's the first time</i>

47:54.917 --> 48:00.422
<i>Marvel has had to accommodate</i>
<i>for so many flying sequences.</i>

48:00.506 --> 48:03.383
<i>And it was a real challenge...</i>

48:03.467 --> 48:05.552
<i>I mean, Kathryn's in a ridiculous costume</i>

48:05.636 --> 48:09.056
<i>that is very uncomfortable</i>
<i>to harness and fly in.</i>

48:09.139 --> 48:14.186
But we all just, like,
we're always harnessed

48:14.269 --> 48:16.063
(LAUGHS) <i>like, for the last six weeks.</i>

48:16.647 --> 48:20.817
<i>We've been harnessed quite a bit,</i>
<i>and it was so fun.</i>

48:20.901 --> 48:22.528
It was... I love flying.

48:22.611 --> 48:26.365
I love doing all the flying work,
I really, truly enjoy it so much.

48:26.448 --> 48:28.992
<i>But we... I think it's the first time</i>

48:29.076 --> 48:32.955
<i>I think Marvel's really had to create</i>
<i>a full fight sequence in the air.</i>

48:33.038 --> 48:34.498
(GRUNTS)

48:38.794 --> 48:40.712
(CACKLING)

48:40.796 --> 48:42.548
I think my most gratifying was

48:43.590 --> 48:46.343
<i>when I finally put on Agatha's hero look</i>

48:46.426 --> 48:51.473
<i>and was able to be raised up</i>
<i>in those wires for the first time.</i>

48:51.557 --> 48:53.767
-OLSEN: You look amazing.
-You look amazing.

48:53.851 --> 48:56.186
HAHN:<i> And feel those huge fans on me,</i>

48:56.270 --> 48:59.106
even though it was like
a hundred and something degrees outside.

48:59.189 --> 49:02.943
It was like crazy just to feel
all the work of all these people

49:03.026 --> 49:07.447
<i>that had gone into collaborating,</i>
<i>into helping make her.</i>

49:07.531 --> 49:09.783
You're supposed to be a myth.

49:10.909 --> 49:15.289
A being capable of spontaneous creation,

49:15.372 --> 49:20.836
and here you are,
using it to make breakfast for dinner!

49:20.919 --> 49:25.674
To play the good and the bad,
to play the wicked and the playful,

49:25.757 --> 49:29.052
<i>and to play a villain that's also funny,</i>

49:29.136 --> 49:30.846
<i>it's the best.</i>

49:30.929 --> 49:33.182
There's more. I want it all.

49:33.265 --> 49:36.768
OLSEN:<i> When you're on these big films,</i>
<i>and you get all those pieces moving</i>

49:36.852 --> 49:40.522
that are in the world's control,
it feels really special.

49:40.606 --> 49:41.940
Thanks for the lesson...

49:44.651 --> 49:50.574
but I don't need you to tell me who I am.

49:53.160 --> 49:57.122
The features, as you know,
set a very high bar for the look,

49:57.206 --> 50:02.753
and for the effects to supplement
the story, not overwhelm the story.

50:02.836 --> 50:06.256
<i>That same mandate for the features</i>

50:06.340 --> 50:10.052
was absolutely what they were wanting
to achieve for the streaming service.

50:10.135 --> 50:13.305
<i>Vision himself, he's a digital prosthetic.</i>

50:13.388 --> 50:15.098
<i>Poor Paul, we paint him purple,</i>

50:15.182 --> 50:17.017
<i>and he has to go through</i>
<i>the day like that.</i>

50:17.100 --> 50:20.270
<i>But otherwise,</i>
<i>all the rest of that is a digital effect.</i>

50:20.354 --> 50:25.025
Every time Vision's synthezoid,
that he's got a CG face,

50:25.108 --> 50:28.987
(CHUCKLES) so we would
go back to Matt and say,

50:29.071 --> 50:30.656
"Do you know, for this beat,

50:30.739 --> 50:34.034
"does he really need to be synthezoid?
Could he be human?"

50:34.117 --> 50:36.537
<i>And Matt and Jac would</i>
<i>often come back with,</i>

50:36.620 --> 50:38.288
<i>"Well, he's his true self.</i>

50:38.372 --> 50:42.376
"You know, when he's in his home,
we want specific beats to be synthezoid

50:42.459 --> 50:44.169
"even though they're visual effect shots,

50:44.253 --> 50:47.047
"just because it's who he is
when he's at home with Wanda."

50:47.130 --> 50:51.093
<i>So, we let the story determine</i>
<i>when we'd use the visual effects.</i>

50:51.176 --> 50:54.471
So when we translated Red Vision
into black and white,

50:54.555 --> 50:56.056
he didn't really look like Vision.

50:56.139 --> 50:59.393
We did tests using footage
from the previous films

50:59.476 --> 51:01.687
as my first week on the job.

51:01.770 --> 51:05.190
We knocked on a colorist's door and said,
"Can we see what he looks like?"

51:05.274 --> 51:07.693
<i>And we quickly realized</i>
<i>he would have to be blue.</i>

51:07.776 --> 51:11.321
UNDERDAHL: <i>During the '50s and '60s,</i>
<i>actresses would actually use blue makeup,</i>

51:11.405 --> 51:13.282
<i>blue lipstick</i>
<i>so their lips would appear red.</i>

51:13.365 --> 51:16.076
And lo and behold,
we did the same with Paul,

51:16.159 --> 51:19.204
found the right, uh, shade of blue
during some camera tests,

51:19.288 --> 51:23.125
<i>did a little additional tweaking in the DI</i>
<i>and found a really good target.</i>

51:28.172 --> 51:32.509
What we got to was a place
where we really keep the performance.

51:32.593 --> 51:34.219
<i>Paul is Vision,</i>

51:34.303 --> 51:37.806
<i>and so what we end up doing</i>
<i>is kind of painting out his ears,</i>

51:37.890 --> 51:41.226
<i>and augmenting and tracking CG</i>
<i>onto his body,</i>

51:41.310 --> 51:42.436
but that's him.

51:48.317 --> 51:51.653
UNDERDAHL: <i>Wanda's world</i>
<i>is her safe haven,</i>

51:51.737 --> 51:56.533
so when the Hex takes over
the military base,

51:57.159 --> 52:00.370
<i>it turns into a happy thing, into a...</i>

52:00.454 --> 52:04.166
<i>a kind of absurd thing almost,</i>
<i>which is the circus, which is fun.</i>

52:04.249 --> 52:06.877
For visual effects,
it wasn't necessarily a complicated thing.

52:06.960 --> 52:08.712
You shoot the A side, then the B side,

52:09.296 --> 52:11.089
<i>and then you augment each.</i>

52:14.718 --> 52:18.639
We knew that the Hex had to be a boundary

52:18.722 --> 52:22.184
that kept the townspeople in,

52:22.267 --> 52:25.687
but that was mysterious
to the people on the outside.

52:25.771 --> 52:28.440
<i>We decided early</i>
<i>that it would be more mysterious</i>

52:28.524 --> 52:30.442
<i>if it was an invisible Hex.</i>

52:30.526 --> 52:35.531
<i>And so it helped build tension</i>
<i>and we got to make it look quite cool.</i>

52:35.614 --> 52:41.078
We looked at all different manners
of film boundaries in the past

52:41.161 --> 52:45.332
<i>and decided that we wanted our Hex</i>
<i>to have the language of television.</i>

52:47.209 --> 52:53.048
<i>So, we studied how magnets</i>
<i>were drawn on old CRT televisions</i>

52:53.131 --> 52:56.218
<i>and the magnetization</i>
<i>you would get across the screen,</i>

52:56.301 --> 52:59.805
the pixelization you would get
when you zoomed way into an old TV.

53:00.305 --> 53:03.058
<i>The cathodic lines or those skinny lines</i>
<i>that you would see</i>

53:03.141 --> 53:05.853
<i>in NTSC old, square TVs.</i>

53:05.936 --> 53:08.397
And so we went to photography,

53:08.480 --> 53:12.609
and we found our favorite images
for what this boundary could be,

53:12.693 --> 53:14.486
using the language of television.

53:16.321 --> 53:20.534
<i>Westview was meant</i>
<i>to be Wanda's idyllic town,</i>

53:20.617 --> 53:22.452
<i>so that was a touchstone.</i>

53:22.536 --> 53:27.082
Everything about Wanda's home inside,
outside, and the town they live in,

53:27.165 --> 53:32.045
<i>came from this concept</i>
<i>that she recreated the reality she wanted</i>

53:32.129 --> 53:34.715
<i>from her childhood,</i>
<i>from those television shows.</i>

53:35.757 --> 53:40.512
It's executing a vision to the standard
that Wanda would have wanted.

53:51.815 --> 53:54.943
As far as TV goes,
there is an argument that

53:55.027 --> 53:59.323
<i>Avengers and the Marvel MCU</i>

53:59.406 --> 54:04.661
<i>is the largest</i>
<i>episodic experiment ever, right?</i>

54:04.745 --> 54:09.416
Because it's like these shows
that then have interconnected spin-offs

54:09.499 --> 54:12.336
and then different... Until we culminate.

54:12.419 --> 54:13.670
Spirits lifted.

54:14.129 --> 54:17.216
BETTANY: <i>It has always</i>
<i>been episodic storytelling,</i>

54:17.299 --> 54:20.552
so that didn't feel that different for me.

54:20.636 --> 54:24.181
What feels different
is the focus on Wanda and Vision,

54:24.264 --> 54:26.225
<i>which is really nice after all this time.</i>

54:26.308 --> 54:29.436
OLSEN: <i>I think</i>
<i>the beauty of what Jac Schaeffer,</i>

54:29.520 --> 54:33.482
<i>and Mary Livanos, Matt,</i>
<i>and Feige put together</i>

54:33.565 --> 54:38.153
<i>was a story that can only be told</i>
<i>in the medium of television.</i>

54:38.237 --> 54:41.782
And the way we're telling it
is a complete conversation

54:41.865 --> 54:45.827
<i>of American sitcom hitting against</i>
<i>the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</i>

54:48.080 --> 54:52.459
<i>For Marvel to take the opportunity</i>
<i>to do a television show,</i>

54:52.543 --> 54:57.464
<i>and for the first show to come out to be</i>
<i>an actual love song to American sitcoms,</i>

54:57.548 --> 55:03.095
is so perfect, and it's so perfect
for Wanda's character.

55:05.556 --> 55:09.518
<i>Dick Van Dyke</i> again?
Always "sitcom, sitcom, sitcom..."

55:09.601 --> 55:12.229
The thing that I really loved
at the end of the journey

55:12.312 --> 55:17.192
is, I think it's the first time Wanda
has really accepted who she is

55:17.276 --> 55:20.362
<i>and actually puts to bed so much pain.</i>

55:20.445 --> 55:25.284
<i>And we find her finally having peace</i>
<i>and being okay.</i>

55:25.367 --> 55:26.994
I can't feel you.

55:27.077 --> 55:33.417
I'm so excited now that we've cracked open
this other part of her,

55:33.500 --> 55:37.671
<i>so that there hopefully</i>
<i>could be more stories to tell.</i>

55:37.754 --> 55:43.218
It's been such a gift, and so I really
loved doing this show. (CHUCKLES)

55:43.302 --> 55:44.511
Cut.

55:44.595 --> 55:46.597
MAN: That is a wrap on Lizzy.

55:48.015 --> 55:49.349
VISION:<i> I've never experienced loss</i>

55:49.433 --> 55:53.353
<i>because I've never</i>
<i>had a loved one to lose.</i>

55:55.689 --> 55:56.982
<i>But what is grief...</i>

55:58.525 --> 56:01.570
<i>if not love persevering?</i>
