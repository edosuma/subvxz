00:01.054 --> 00:04.197
Cue the rain.
Ready, action. Rita:
<i>Last week, our final four</i>

00:04.197 --> 00:05.267
<i>had their toughest
challenge yet...</i>

00:05.267 --> 00:07.541
Get the London Look.

00:07.541 --> 00:09.179
<i>...shooting
their Rimmel commercial.</i>

00:09.179 --> 00:10.450
It's like you're doing the line
and turning at the same time.

00:10.450 --> 00:13.191
It's a little
bit whiplash.

00:13.191 --> 00:14.896
<i>With India taking the top
spot for the fifth time.</i>

00:14.896 --> 00:18.708
At the end of the day,
you sold it.

00:18.708 --> 00:20.446
<i>Coryanne and Courtney
onceagain landed in the bottom
two,</i>

00:20.446 --> 00:23.556
<i>and Courtney
was sent home.</i>

00:23.556 --> 00:25.929
When you look back
at your whole body of work,

00:25.929 --> 00:28.102
- you're gonna be so
proud. - Thank you.

00:28.102 --> 00:29.106
<i>Tonight, it's down
to our final three models.</i>

00:29.106 --> 00:33.452
Yay!

00:33.452 --> 00:35.559
<i>They'll need to nail
their fashion spread
for "Paper" magazine.</i>

00:35.559 --> 00:38.902
Let's see some of
those classic poses.

00:38.902 --> 00:41.744
<i>Then stomp it out
on the final runway
for The Blonds.</i>

00:41.744 --> 00:44.752
Drew:
Work, work, work.

00:44.752 --> 00:46.659
<i>Who will become
"America's Next Top Model"?</i>

00:46.659 --> 00:48.664
<i>You're about to find out
right now.</i>

01:44.297 --> 01:49.915
Congratulations.
We have saved the best for last.

01:49.915 --> 01:54.963
Today is the day we're
shooting your multi-page spread
for "Paper" magazine.

01:54.963 --> 01:58.808
India:
It's our final shoot
for "Paper" magazine

01:58.808 --> 02:01.817
<i>and I'm especially
nervous today</i>

02:01.817 --> 02:03.990
because it's our last
chance to impress them.

02:03.990 --> 02:06.029
Today we're going to be
shooting with one of "Paper's"
favorite photographers,

02:06.029 --> 02:09.707
Charlotte Rutherford.
She just shot Blac Chyna for us.

02:09.707 --> 02:10.710
<i>She's done Tinashe. She shot
Amber Rose for us as a series f
feminist icons.</i>

02:12.214 --> 02:16.460
She's amazing.
So you ready?

02:16.460 --> 02:18.968
So let's go.

02:18.968 --> 02:22.111
I wonder what the vibe is.
I don't know.

02:22.111 --> 02:23.850
- I see a lot of fur.
- Look at all those jackets.

02:23.850 --> 02:26.625
The pressure
is definitely on.

02:26.625 --> 02:28.998
<i>Everyone sees "Paper"
magazine on social media,</i>

02:28.998 --> 02:31.171
<i>so I'm confident,
but I'm also, like,
a little scared.</i>

02:31.171 --> 02:34.481
You just never know,
so I'm just grateful
to be here.

02:34.481 --> 02:36.722
Do you think were gonna have
a different outfit
for every page?

02:36.722 --> 02:39.195
- Yeah.
- You know,
this is the final week.

02:39.195 --> 02:41.267
This is our last chance
to show the judges

02:41.267 --> 02:43.207
why we deserve to be
"America's Next Top Model.

02:43.207 --> 02:45.882
I do feel like I have
a lot more to prove.

02:45.882 --> 02:48.055
I gotta show them
that I have a lot to offer,
that I can do this.

02:48.055 --> 02:51.098
Doing four set-ups.
I think multiple looks
per set-up.

02:51.098 --> 02:55.544
And just keep in mind
there's beauty,
there's fashion.

02:55.544 --> 02:58.085
There'll be--
it's gonna be everything.

03:01.060 --> 03:01.194
- We're the last three.
- Ooh.

03:05.708 --> 03:08.382
Next time, it'll
be just one. Crazy.

03:08.382 --> 03:11.960
No one really noticed me in the
<i>beginning of the
competition.</i>

03:11.960 --> 03:14.100
<i>I was being called
fifth or sixth.</i>

03:14.100 --> 03:16.473
Just smack dab
in the middle.

03:16.473 --> 03:18.145
<i>And then the fire
ignited in me</i>

03:18.145 --> 03:19.482
<i>when I was in
the bottom three</i>

03:19.482 --> 03:21.121
<i>for the boxing shoot.</i>

03:21.121 --> 03:23.796
Your style, way better
than Chanel was.

03:23.796 --> 03:25.669
<i>But she steals
the pictures.</i>

03:25.669 --> 03:28.576
This isn't India's shoot,
unfortunately.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.583
India: <i>Since that day, I've
only been called first or
second.</i>

03:30.583 --> 03:32.656
So if I say I'm gonna win this,
I'm gonna win this.

03:35.162 --> 03:35.665
- This is good on you.
Do you like this?
- I love it.

03:39.710 --> 03:42.151
Today is gonna be
a very long day

03:42.151 --> 03:44.156
because we have to shoot
six full pages.

03:44.156 --> 03:46.698
Get in there.
All right, this is where
it really counts.

03:46.698 --> 03:49.573
<i>But what Charlotte's going
to really build out today</i>

03:49.573 --> 03:51.746
<i>it this idea of,
like, being a boss,
but having fun with it.</i>

03:51.746 --> 03:56.326
Have your hand this way
so the phone is like--
yeah. Cheese.

03:56.326 --> 03:58.901
And each time
give different looks.
This is as real as it gets.

03:58.901 --> 04:03.313
Have this hand, like,
more like limp.
Just like-- cute.

04:03.313 --> 04:07.560
Tatiana:
I'm the type of person I feel
like nothing is impossible.

04:07.560 --> 04:10.368
I want an empire.

04:10.368 --> 04:12.441
I want to be able to
provide for everyone that I
love.

04:12.441 --> 04:14.683
<i>So I'm just trying to be
the best that I can be</i>

04:14.683 --> 04:18.059
<i>and hoping and praying</i>

04:18.059 --> 04:19.261
<i>that I will be
America's Next Top Model.</i>

04:19.261 --> 04:22.940
Drew:
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

04:22.940 --> 04:25.313
Coryanne: <i>Going into
the final shoot,</i>

04:25.313 --> 04:27.553
<i>I feel like I'm, like,
surprising myself even.</i>

04:27.553 --> 04:30.128
<i>In the beginning,
I really felt like</i>

04:30.128 --> 04:31.900
<i>"I'm not gonna photograph
nearly as well as all
these girls."</i>

04:31.900 --> 04:34.207
But now when I get in front
of the camera,

04:34.207 --> 04:36.113
I feel like, "This is about
to be a great picture."

04:36.113 --> 04:38.219
Charlotte:
Have the phone in the other hand
so you're mid-conversation.

04:38.219 --> 04:40.827
These are very edgy
for you, Coryanne.

04:40.827 --> 04:42.800
- I like it.
- ( chuckles ) Cute.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.173
- Next.
Go, go, go.
- Let's do it.

04:45.173 --> 04:47.915
I'm ready to work
these pant legs.

04:47.915 --> 04:49.285
I definitely did not see myself
making it this far.

04:49.285 --> 04:52.327
- And now I'm in the top
three. - Yes!

04:52.327 --> 04:55.036
<i>The judges keep saying
that they want consistency,</i>

04:55.036 --> 04:57.109
which is what I am bringing.

04:57.109 --> 05:01.354
- You're breaking the
camera! - ( laughing )

05:01.354 --> 05:03.963
Tatiana:
India, I feel like,
not being in the bottom two,

05:03.963 --> 05:05.935
<i>she's never had that feeling
of being, like,</i>

05:05.935 --> 05:07.540
<i>knocked off
of her high horse,</i>

05:07.540 --> 05:09.111
but I'm definitely not taking
this situation for granted.

05:09.111 --> 05:11.351
I work hard
and I am stronger.

05:11.351 --> 05:14.862
- What's wrong, babe?
- Nothing. I'm just--

05:14.862 --> 05:16.802
- I thought you were
crying. - We thought you were
having a breakdown.

05:16.802 --> 05:21.314
Charlotte: Nice.
Angry, moody vibes.

05:21.314 --> 05:25.193
Tatiana gave us
amazing body shots,

05:25.193 --> 05:27.901
which she normally
doesn't do.

05:27.901 --> 05:29.405
<i>She was really working
her angles</i>

05:29.405 --> 05:31.746
<i>and doing some
really fun things.</i>

05:31.746 --> 05:34.387
<i>but the face was a little bit
less editorial.</i>

05:34.387 --> 05:36.259
Charlotte:
Just like a little bit more
intensity in your face.

05:36.259 --> 05:37.831
So I don't know how it's going
to end up in the edit.

05:37.831 --> 05:41.743
Charlotte: Cute.
Eyes to me.

05:41.743 --> 05:44.383
Tilt your face.
You face is a little like this
right now.

05:44.383 --> 05:47.192
Yeah, there you go.
That's much better.

05:47.192 --> 05:49.767
Face to me.
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:49.767 --> 05:53.110
Yes!
Cool, perfect.

05:53.110 --> 05:55.116
Maybe what if you hold it
with one hand and then
your other hand you're like, ah.

05:55.116 --> 05:58.158
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Work it.

05:58.158 --> 06:01.234
Okay now, Tatiana,
totally robot.

06:01.234 --> 06:03.073
' Cause these aren't,
like, killing it for me.

06:03.073 --> 06:06.316
It's not corny.
It's like Prada.

06:06.316 --> 06:10.294
You know
what I'm saying? Prada.
That's much better.

06:10.294 --> 06:13.003
Coryanne: Tatiana, I feel like
she can only do commercial
and not editorial.

06:13.003 --> 06:16.446
Work with angles
of your face, Coryanne.

06:16.446 --> 06:18.653
Coryanne:
And so I feel like
in the end of it,

06:18.653 --> 06:20.693
it's just gonna be me and
India based on our versatility.

06:20.693 --> 06:22.966
India, I kinda want you to
do a couple where you're, like,
dead face.

06:22.966 --> 06:26.009
It's like you have no
brain. The computer's gonna tell
you what to do.

06:26.009 --> 06:29.351
Give us nothing.
Dead.

06:29.351 --> 06:32.562
I am a computer.

06:32.562 --> 06:34.166
India really started
the day off strong,

06:34.166 --> 06:35.738
<i>but she really started
to fizzle.</i>

06:35.738 --> 06:37.911
The beginning ones
were stronger.

06:37.911 --> 06:39.148
I don't know what
the difference is,

06:39.148 --> 06:40.853
but those were stronger.

06:40.853 --> 06:42.324
And she's just not
hitting it.

06:42.324 --> 06:43.829
I feel like I'm struggling
for some reason.

06:43.829 --> 06:45.835
I don't know
if she's worn down.

06:45.835 --> 06:47.506
<i>I don't know
what's causing it.</i>

06:47.506 --> 06:48.241
And it's so frustrating
'cause I know she has it in her.

06:51.685 --> 06:56.567
I feel like my last couple
of looks were under par.

06:56.567 --> 06:59.375
It's a little bit evil
and it's a little bit like,

06:59.375 --> 07:02.116
"I have nothing
behind these eyeballs.
I am a robot."

07:02.116 --> 07:06.730
India:
As I'm shooting,
I start thinking,

07:06.730 --> 07:08.737
"If I went home, I'd be
super angry with myself."

07:08.737 --> 07:10.910
- Whoo.
- There you go. Done!

07:17.763 --> 07:22.612
This probably is no longer good.
I don't even want to risk that.

07:22.612 --> 07:26.056
I got a big show tomorrow,
you know?

07:26.056 --> 07:28.061
Oh, yeah, yeah.
For The Blonds.

07:28.061 --> 07:29.265
Some little thing
I heard about.

07:29.265 --> 07:32.407
I'm excited to see
what we're wearing.

07:32.407 --> 07:34.280
- I feel like we're
gonna be wearing...
- Metallic bands.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.988
- Dog ( bleep ). Ooh!
- Floor-length gowns.

07:36.988 --> 07:39.595
Guys!
Rita Alert.

07:43.173 --> 07:47.988
Good evening, ladies.
I hope you've all enjoyed

07:47.988 --> 07:50.662
your photo shoot
with "Paper" magazine.

07:50.662 --> 07:52.802
Because tomorrow, you'll be
walking the final runway

07:52.802 --> 07:55.175
to help us determine who
will become the next top model.

07:57.015 --> 08:01.529
Good luck.

08:01.529 --> 08:04.537
Well, ladies,
it's been real.

08:04.537 --> 08:06.042
How do you feel about being
in the top three, India?

08:06.042 --> 08:08.482
Wait,
how about Coryanne first?

08:08.482 --> 08:09.753
I'm gonna be $100,000 richer
real soon.

08:09.753 --> 08:13.330
( gasps )
Take back the mic.

08:13.330 --> 08:15.436
Coryanne is
America's Next Top Model.

08:15.436 --> 08:18.078
<i>Coryanne,
quadruple threat.</i>

08:18.078 --> 08:20.050
Actor, singer,
dancer, model. Host?

08:20.050 --> 08:24.430
- India?
- I'm about to be
$100,000 richer.

08:24.430 --> 08:28.576
- Great, great, great.
- Oh, funny, funny.
You're so cute.

08:28.576 --> 08:31.183
India:
Tomorrow we are walking
in our final runway show,

08:31.183 --> 08:35.362
and I am ready
to kick ass.

08:35.362 --> 08:38.138
I can see myself becoming
America's Next Top Model.

08:38.138 --> 08:41.147
I really can, so my plan
is to win this damn thing.

08:41.147 --> 08:44.791
I came far enough.
I don't want to lose.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.095
No matter what, like,
honestly, I feel like I love you
guys.

08:46.095 --> 08:50.642
- Aww.
- We've come so far.

08:50.642 --> 08:53.182
And the fact that we're here,
we need to, like, represent.

08:53.182 --> 08:55.489
Going into this final
runway, I feel like you have to
be

08:55.489 --> 08:58.131
more than just
an amazing talent.

08:58.131 --> 08:59.301
And I exemplify everything that
<i>the judges are looking
for.</i>

08:59.301 --> 09:02.644
I'm America's Next Top Model.

09:02.644 --> 09:03.647
This is the final.
This is the final.

09:06.022 --> 09:10.167
India:
<i>This is the grand finale.</i>

09:10.167 --> 09:11.805
<i>This is where we prove
who America's Next Top Model
is.</i>

09:11.805 --> 09:15.817
I feel like
your energy's down a bit.
A lot, actually.

09:15.817 --> 09:18.994
Not a bit, a lot.
I've never seen her like this.

09:18.994 --> 09:21.367
I see a winner
like how I see Tyra.

09:21.367 --> 09:23.172
- Well, hello.
- Ahh!

09:42.998 --> 09:48.381
- Hello, ladies.
- Hi.

09:48.381 --> 09:50.521
In about eight hours' time,
this place is going to be
packed full of people

09:50.521 --> 09:54.901
dying to see
the final three models
walk this runway.

09:54.901 --> 09:59.481
Everything comes down
to this.

09:59.481 --> 10:01.453
<i>I'm gonna be nervous,
of course,</i>

10:01.453 --> 10:03.393
but I've got to show
the judges that, you know,

10:03.393 --> 10:05.232
that I've come a long way
and this is who I am

10:05.232 --> 10:07.405
and I'm out of my shell
like they like to say.

10:07.405 --> 10:09.779
And, you know, I'm here.
I'm ready.

10:09.779 --> 10:12.153
Drew:
Tonight will be awesome.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.590
We're gonna have
a live performance.

10:13.590 --> 10:14.994
We'll have video projections.

10:14.994 --> 10:17.401
There'll be
choreographed lights.

10:17.401 --> 10:19.274
And also,
as you can see behind me,
there are three runways.

10:19.274 --> 10:22.250
- One for each of you.
- Girls: Oh.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.991
And you'll also be joined
by some familiar faces.

10:24.991 --> 10:27.699
The 11 girls that you
started this journey with

10:27.699 --> 10:30.140
will be here
and walking the show with you.

10:30.140 --> 10:32.346
And they're already
backstage getting ready.

10:32.346 --> 10:34.988
Ashley:
This is your last chance
to impress us.

10:34.988 --> 10:36.125
And this room is gonna be filled
with top fashion influencers.

10:37.461 --> 10:41.975
We have a lot to do
in a short about of time,

10:41.975 --> 10:43.981
so let's get started.

10:44.884 --> 10:46.053
( all screaming )

10:53.711 --> 10:58.525
- Look at this.
- Oh, my God.

10:58.525 --> 11:02.170
You're in the top three
of "America's Next Top Model."

11:02.170 --> 11:03.908
Yes. Ahh!
I miss you.

11:03.908 --> 11:07.118
I know, I know, I know,
I know.

11:07.118 --> 11:08.689
The final three girls
are all stunning,

11:08.689 --> 11:11.230
<i>but I'd say
Tatiana's my girl.</i>

11:11.230 --> 11:13.837
I'm so proud of you.
I'm so proud of you.

11:13.837 --> 11:15.510
Coryanne:
I got pep talks
from Tash and Cody,

11:18.351 --> 11:19.722
saying things like,
"You got this.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.562
You're everything they want."

11:21.562 --> 11:23.233
I really needed
all the support I could get.

11:23.233 --> 11:24.236
Courtney, you should buy
that. You should own that.

11:24.236 --> 11:27.077
Thanks.
If I was a judge,

11:27.077 --> 11:28.982
<i>I would choose
Coryanne.</i>

11:28.982 --> 11:30.555
She's not only
a beautiful model,

11:30.555 --> 11:32.594
but she knows how to work
with TV.

11:32.594 --> 11:35.335
How did you wake up
feeling this morning?

11:35.335 --> 11:37.073
I don't know.
I'm feeling good.

11:37.073 --> 11:38.445
I think just walking
into this room,

11:38.445 --> 11:40.082
I was like, "Whoa!
We're in the finale."

11:40.082 --> 11:42.456
From the very beginning,
I bonded with India.

11:42.456 --> 11:45.064
So I really want
for her to win.

11:45.064 --> 11:46.970
- Hi, Binta.
- You better win this.

11:46.970 --> 11:48.942
- I will.
- I know you will.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.447
Do it for Seattle.

11:50.447 --> 11:52.320
I know you got it.
Like, I know.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.791
- I hope.
- We all know.
We all know.

11:53.791 --> 11:57.536
Hello.

11:57.536 --> 11:59.642
You know how I said we were
gonna have a live performance?

11:59.642 --> 12:01.815
Well, I just wanted to
introduce you to our performer.

12:01.815 --> 12:06.127
- Tinashe.
- Hi, everyone.

12:06.127 --> 12:09.972
We just featured her
in "Paper" magazine.

12:09.972 --> 12:12.012
Tinashe:
<i>Yeah, that was so fun.</i>

12:12.012 --> 12:13.183
- What are you gonna sing?
- I'm singing "Superlove" today.

12:13.183 --> 12:15.188
So that'll be really fun.

12:15.188 --> 12:17.161
And you ladies
are gonna join me, like,

12:17.161 --> 12:19.032
walking around
where I'm performing,

12:19.032 --> 12:21.340
so I'm super excited
about that.

12:21.340 --> 12:22.544
So you guys can, like,
bring the performance up.

12:22.544 --> 12:25.587
- Good luck.
- All: Thank you.

12:25.587 --> 12:27.726
- I'm so excited.
- Drew: We'll be back.

12:27.726 --> 12:31.002
- It's cute, right? Just
for a little more dimension. -
Yeah. It is.

12:31.002 --> 12:34.212
- Are you guys the
finalists? - Both: Yes.

12:34.212 --> 12:37.053
I'm Tim Stack from "EW."

12:37.053 --> 12:38.559
So Tim is here
from "Entertainment Weekly."

12:38.559 --> 12:40.062
Yeah, and it's so cool
to get interviewed.

12:40.062 --> 12:41.266
I'm just here
to gain a platform,

12:41.266 --> 12:42.904
be able to influence
other people.

12:42.904 --> 12:44.409
<i>Tonight is the one
night that we have</i>

12:44.409 --> 12:46.448
to just show everything
that we've learned

12:46.448 --> 12:48.555
<i>and I know what
I have to do.</i>

12:48.555 --> 12:50.393
So you all seem
like winners right now,

12:50.393 --> 12:52.031
- so good luck.
- Thank you so much.

12:52.031 --> 12:54.473
- Hey, guys,
I have The Blonds!
- ( cheering )

12:54.473 --> 12:58.786
Oh, my God.
The Blonds is such
a cool clothing line.

12:58.786 --> 13:02.731
<i>A lot of metallics
and edgy, loud.</i>

13:02.731 --> 13:05.673
Their outfits are amazing
of course.

13:05.673 --> 13:07.679
This is David and
Phillipe. This is The Blonds.

13:07.679 --> 13:09.952
And they have dressed
every single person
under the sun.

13:09.952 --> 13:13.463
From Gaga to Britney
to Beyoncé to Rita herself.

13:13.463 --> 13:18.277
- Wow.
- And it's their tenth
anniversary.

13:18.277 --> 13:21.186
<i>So this collection
that we're showing</i>

13:21.186 --> 13:22.657
<i>is actually
ten years of amazing designs
that they've created.</i>

13:22.657 --> 13:27.438
So happy to be here
with you girls.

13:27.438 --> 13:28.976
- Can't wait to see you
looking gorgeous.
- Thank you.

13:28.976 --> 13:31.785
So, India and Coryanne,
Tatiana,

13:31.785 --> 13:35.194
if we can grab you guys
and these guys are gonna
fit you.

13:35.194 --> 13:37.401
Do you guys
have a repair kit?

13:40.175 --> 13:41.313
I wanted to put, like,
a quick stitch here.

13:41.313 --> 13:44.890
Good. Cute.
Super cute.

13:44.890 --> 13:47.699
Sorry,
this is gonna be cold.

13:47.699 --> 13:49.036
I was just thinking that.
No worries. Ooh.

13:49.036 --> 13:51.042
- I love the chaos.
- Yeah?

13:51.042 --> 13:51.844
- I love it.
- You live for it.

13:51.844 --> 13:53.383
I live for it.

13:53.383 --> 13:54.954
- She's full of herself.
- I love it.

13:54.954 --> 13:57.394
Boom, boom, boom.

13:58.229 --> 13:59.500
Ladies, what up?

14:03.044 --> 14:06.723
Oh, my God.
You guys look sick.

14:06.723 --> 14:08.895
Oh, my gosh.
I done got goosebumps.
Are you ready?

14:08.895 --> 14:11.403
Pay attention
to what the designer
wants you guys to portray.

14:11.403 --> 14:13.577
How they want you to walk
on the runway.

14:13.577 --> 14:15.381
How they want you
to sell their clothing.

14:15.381 --> 14:16.820
When you go out there,
just remember that this

14:16.820 --> 14:19.159
- is more about savage
glamor. - This is strong.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.433
- Yes, you're strong,
you're powerful.
- You're all queens.

14:21.433 --> 14:24.475
You're not learning anymore.

14:24.475 --> 14:26.013
Now it's time to bring it
and show them that
you're really models.

14:26.013 --> 14:28.321
I want to see
what each of you got.

14:28.321 --> 14:30.327
This runway show,
it's the summation of
this whole competition.

14:30.327 --> 14:32.834
<i>It's everything we've learned
coming into play.</i>

14:32.834 --> 14:34.907
<i>And it's just--
there's a lot.</i>

14:34.907 --> 14:36.746
<i>I'm just scared to go home
this week.</i>

14:36.746 --> 14:38.985
I'm scared
to go home a loser.

14:38.985 --> 14:40.156
I would definitely
relax your arms a little bit,
but you totally got it.

14:40.156 --> 14:43.867
All righty, next.

14:43.867 --> 14:45.171
It's so much stuff
that goes into the show

14:45.171 --> 14:48.381
<i>and so much coordination.</i>

14:48.381 --> 14:50.119
So I definitely want to impress
<i>Stacey with my runway
walk.</i>

14:50.119 --> 14:52.994
Okay, can I say something
real quick?

14:52.994 --> 14:54.164
I feel like your energy
is down a bit.

14:54.164 --> 14:56.506
A lot, actually.
Not a bit, a lot.

14:56.506 --> 14:57.842
Bring more, okay?
I've never seen her like that.

14:57.842 --> 15:00.182
She's usually, like,
really strong and bad-ass.

15:00.182 --> 15:04.696
- Get yours.
- Gotcha.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.536
I've seen you.
Build yourself up
in your mind.

15:06.536 --> 15:08.642
Build that ego like,
"I'm the ( bleep ).

15:08.642 --> 15:10.682
I'm so hot, I'm so fine."
You're in the top three.

15:10.682 --> 15:13.088
- I know, I know.
- Focus right now, okay?

15:13.088 --> 15:15.428
I want you to walk
one more time.
Go, go.

15:15.428 --> 15:18.606
Make sure
to extend your legs more.
Go back again. I want it again.

15:18.606 --> 15:21.914
Tatiana: <i>I was under
a lot of pressure.</i>

15:21.914 --> 15:23.386
This has definitely not
been the easiest journey for me

15:23.386 --> 15:25.960
I mean,
I have so much to lose.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.866
I want more.
Go one more time.

15:27.866 --> 15:29.102
One more time.
No talking, just do.

15:30.742 --> 15:32.479
Drew: All right, guys.
Come on, come on!

15:35.856 --> 15:37.394
India: Backstage,
everyone's screaming
and yelling.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.735
- India! Come this way!
- India.

15:39.735 --> 15:41.373
<i>A lot of tension
was building up.</i>

15:41.373 --> 15:43.647
I was freaking out.

15:43.647 --> 15:45.485
Would I see you on
the cover of "Paper"?

15:45.485 --> 15:47.892
No.

16:06.013 --> 16:11.161
Stacey: Guys, everybody,
I'm gonna send you out now.

16:11.161 --> 16:13.167
Drew: All right, guys,
come on, come on, come on.

16:13.167 --> 16:15.374
All right, guys,
it's packed, packed, packed.

16:15.374 --> 16:18.986
This is what
we're judging in panel.

16:18.986 --> 16:21.325
This runway show
is the grand finale.

16:21.325 --> 16:24.301
This is it.
This is the moment.

16:24.301 --> 16:25.539
This is where we really,
really prove to the judges

16:25.539 --> 16:28.380
who America's
Next Top Model is.

16:28.380 --> 16:29.585
All right, guys.
You ready? You ready?

16:29.585 --> 16:32.024
( music playing )

16:50.412 --> 16:55.126
Tatiana:
Being this close to the end
is, like, insane.

16:55.126 --> 16:58.303
I went from like 1 in 28
to 1 in 3.

16:58.303 --> 17:00.242
So I'm nervous,
but I really, really,
really want to win this

17:00.242 --> 17:03.887
and just stomp it out
on the runway.

17:03.887 --> 17:04.488
Go, go, go.

17:05.793 --> 17:06.595
There's our girl.

17:09.839 --> 17:13.784
Ooh, ooh.

17:13.784 --> 17:15.956
Tatiana:
Tonight, this is it.
I need to bring it.

17:15.956 --> 17:19.299
Okay.

17:19.299 --> 17:20.971
<i>Runway was my thing
since the beginning.</i>

17:20.971 --> 17:22.810
Like, I won the first
runway challenge.

17:22.810 --> 17:24.516
I just-- I love her body.
I think her body is so sick.

17:24.516 --> 17:27.858
<i>I'm here to slay,
and I'm here to do</i>

17:27.858 --> 17:29.932
<i>what I have to do
to win this competition.</i>

17:29.932 --> 17:33.644
<i>♪ We do it

17:33.644 --> 17:36.686

- <i>♪ If it says

being up, down, up, down,

17:41.499 --> 17:43.806
from the bottom to top
all the time.

17:43.806 --> 17:46.046
She looks like she belongs
on the runways right now.

17:46.046 --> 17:48.386
<i>It motivated me
to really be better.</i>

17:48.386 --> 17:50.861
Just gotta pick yourself
right back up.

17:50.861 --> 17:53.201
She just needs to
slow down a little.

17:53.201 --> 17:54.639
You got it, you got it.
There you go.

17:54.639 --> 17:56.546
So I'm just like,
eye on the prize.

Did you see that last look
she gave?

18:02.361 --> 18:05.070
- She looked like a
superstar. - Yes, she did.

18:05.070 --> 18:06.575
Drew:
God, it's like
such a crazy moment.

18:06.575 --> 18:08.515
I know, I know. Don't--
don't stress me out.

18:08.515 --> 18:10.687

18:11.724 --> 18:13.930
Yes, India! Whoo!

18:16.606 --> 18:19.479

I am really feeling
my rocker chick side.

18:21.418 --> 18:23.124
<i>I'm feeling
my boss side.</i>

18:23.124 --> 18:26.300
She is killing the runway.

18:26.300 --> 18:28.808
She is torturing
the runway.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.781
If I become a superstar,
I'm gonna do it by being me

18:30.781 --> 18:34.960
and being myself.

18:34.960 --> 18:35.629

This is the final.

20:19.439 --> 20:21.680
I want to see big energy!

20:21.680 --> 20:23.151
Man:
Guys, I need to put
you guys in order.

20:23.151 --> 20:24.320
Stand by. Listen to me.

20:24.320 --> 20:25.726
Paige! Courtney!

20:25.726 --> 20:28.668
Let's go, let's go,

20:28.668 --> 20:31.175
India:

I was doing great.

20:31.175 --> 20:33.080
<i>But backstage,
everyone's screaming
and yelling.</i>

20:33.080 --> 20:34.653
- India! Come this way.
- India.

20:34.653 --> 20:36.490
A lot of tension
was building up,

20:36.490 --> 20:38.998
so I was freaking out.

20:38.998 --> 20:39.734
Tatiana:
India, she does appear
a little bit nervous,

20:43.044 --> 20:45.886
<i>but this is cutthroat.</i>

20:45.886 --> 20:47.691
<i>I want to win,</i>

20:47.691 --> 20:49.563
so I am just ready
to go in there

20:49.563 --> 20:50.734
- and just kill it.
- Big, big, big!

20:50.734 --> 20:52.538
On your marks, ladies.

20:54.713 --> 20:56.182
The winner of "America's
Next Top Model" is...

21:06.782 --> 21:11.361
Are we in our next look?

21:11.361 --> 21:13.536
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, come on.

21:13.536 --> 21:14.739
Guys, I need to put
you guys in order.

21:14.739 --> 21:17.212
Paige! Courtney!

21:17.212 --> 21:18.282
India: I just hit
the breaking point backstage,

21:20.990 --> 21:24.000
and I took my time,
I breathed,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.306
<i>and I was just like,
"Okay, I'm ready
to win this thing."</i>

21:26.306 --> 21:27.510
Drew:
We're good to start.
Here we go.

21:39.445 --> 21:44.427
Tatiana:
<i>I always had the attitude</i>

21:44.427 --> 21:45.799
<i>like, "I'm going to do
something bigger</i>

21:45.799 --> 21:46.836
<i>and better than myself."</i>

21:46.836 --> 21:48.606
<i>And now I can taste--</i>

21:48.606 --> 21:50.312
the winning-- like,
the prize of $100,000

21:50.312 --> 21:52.451
is definitely insane,

21:52.451 --> 21:53.354
<i>and I will be able
to use that money</i>

21:53.354 --> 21:55.460
<i>towards my business.</i>

21:55.460 --> 21:56.664
<i>It's literally
a dream come true.</i>

21:56.664 --> 21:58.402
Yay, yay, yay!
How'd it go? How'd it go?

21:58.402 --> 21:59.539
Good, good, good.

22:01.981 --> 22:06.226
All right, go, India.

22:06.226 --> 22:07.563
- Wow.
- Yes!

22:09.169 --> 22:11.342
Slay us, honey.
Slay us.

22:11.342 --> 22:13.581
India: I think for
a lot of the girls,

22:13.581 --> 22:16.591
this competition
has made them better models.

22:16.591 --> 22:18.195
<i>And I am as well, but I think
the biggest change for me</i>

22:18.195 --> 22:21.672
has been in my confidence.

22:21.672 --> 22:23.745
The confidence
that she's exuding
is insane.

22:23.745 --> 22:26.019
<i>Even the girls who left
in the beginning</i>

22:26.019 --> 22:28.258
<i>said they didn't know
I was like this</i>

22:28.258 --> 22:30.097
<i>and I've become
a new person.</i>

22:30.097 --> 22:31.234
But I haven't.
I've just come out
of my shell.

22:31.234 --> 22:33.041
( applause )

22:33.041 --> 22:34.243
- Whoa!
- Booyah.

22:34.243 --> 22:36.885
( chattering )

22:36.885 --> 22:38.121
Ooh. The spaz.

22:47.684 --> 22:52.331
Oh!

22:52.331 --> 22:54.504
Coryanne:
<i>To be in the final three,</i>

22:54.504 --> 22:55.842
<i>it makes you feel like
you're in the right place.</i>

22:55.842 --> 22:58.249
This is where
I'm supposed to be.

22:58.249 --> 23:00.088
She is so confident.

23:00.088 --> 23:03.263
<i>It's like, I really did put
all of me in it,</i>

23:03.263 --> 23:04.768
<i>and I want to show everyone
that I do deserve</i>

23:04.768 --> 23:06.674
<i>to be America's Next
Top Model.</i>

23:06.674 --> 23:07.610
Second is just
the first loser.

23:12.124 --> 23:16.637
All right, guys.
You ready, you ready?

23:16.637 --> 23:18.810
This is the final!
This is the final!

23:18.810 --> 23:20.516
I want to see big energy!
Big, big, big, big!

23:20.516 --> 23:23.023
India:
<i>I'm standing there,</i>

23:23.023 --> 23:24.461
<i>my heart going at
a million miles an hour.</i>

23:24.461 --> 23:26.166
Now I have to prove
that I'm the best,

23:26.166 --> 23:28.005
because all of us want it
just as badly as anyone else.

23:28.005 --> 23:30.881
<i>So the only way to show</i>

23:30.881 --> 23:32.317
that you want it more
is to perform.

23:32.317 --> 23:34.190
All right, ladies.
Big, big, big, big.

23:34.190 --> 23:36.731
It's the last one.
Here we go!

23:36.731 --> 23:39.338
( cheering )

23:45.624 --> 23:49.904
Woman:
Okay, Ti-nasty!

23:49.904 --> 23:51.474
Okay, Cory!

23:55.721 --> 23:59.465
Seven on one runway.
Seven on the other.

24:11.067 --> 24:15.279
( cheering )

24:15.279 --> 24:17.419
Amazing, amazing, amazing!

24:20.027 --> 24:20.529
Oh, my gosh.
I feel so good.

24:24.274 --> 24:26.949
I feel so energized.

24:26.949 --> 24:28.486
I did my best,
so that's all that
I can really do.

24:28.486 --> 24:30.158
How do you feel?
You feel good?

24:30.158 --> 24:31.595
- Amazing.
- Oh, my gosh.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.166
I feel amazing.
It's all done.

24:33.166 --> 24:35.774
<i>But if I was not
American's Next Top Model,</i>

24:35.774 --> 24:39.218
that would be a very hard
pill to swallow.

24:39.218 --> 24:41.960
Nobody fell.
You guys did amazing.

24:41.960 --> 24:44.535
The confidence felt
like it was oozing.

24:44.535 --> 24:46.507
I'm going to be fantasizing
and trying to visualize

24:46.507 --> 24:49.750
<i>Rita's in the middle
of the stage and she goes,</i>

24:49.750 --> 24:52.423
( English accent )
"And the winner

24:52.423 --> 24:53.327
of 'America's Next
Top Model' is...

24:53.327 --> 24:55.668
Coryanne!"

24:55.668 --> 24:56.603
You guys, seriously,
I'm proud of us.

25:14.356 --> 25:19.038
Hello, India,
Coryanne, and Tatiana.

25:19.038 --> 25:22.247
Your last week here
has been an incredible one.

25:22.247 --> 25:25.757
First posing
for an actual editorial
for "Paper" magazine,

25:25.757 --> 25:29.503
and then walking
in a major runway show
for The Blonds.

25:29.503 --> 25:33.414
Now, let's say hello
to our amazing judges.

25:33.414 --> 25:36.155
Gorgeous supermodel
and body activist,
Ashley Graham.

25:36.155 --> 25:39.633
Our amazing image
architect to the stars, Law
Roach.

25:39.633 --> 25:44.146
And our incredible
creative consultant

25:44.146 --> 25:45.584
and chief creative officer
at "Paper" magazine,
Drew Elliot.

25:45.584 --> 25:49.763
The winner of
"America's Next Top Model"

25:49.763 --> 25:52.371
will receive $100,000
and be featured

25:52.371 --> 25:55.848
in a commercial
thanks to Rimmel London.

25:55.848 --> 25:58.054
In addition, the winner
will also be featured

25:58.054 --> 26:00.562
in a fashion spread
thanks to "Paper" magazine,

26:00.562 --> 26:02.000
and get an exclusive
one-year talent deal with VH1.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.045
Now, for your
last photo shoot,

26:06.045 --> 26:08.319
you did a multipage
spread for "Paper".

26:08.319 --> 26:10.692
The judges and I
have already reviewed

26:10.692 --> 26:13.367
which one is your best photo.

26:13.367 --> 26:15.707
And after we share
our critiques with you,

26:15.707 --> 26:16.977
one of you will be
eliminated immediately.

26:19.051 --> 26:20.588
Okay, first up, Tatiana.

26:23.263 --> 26:24.734
You look incredible.

26:26.272 --> 26:28.547
You all look incredible.

26:28.547 --> 26:30.952
Should we take a look
at your best photo?

26:30.952 --> 26:33.260
I think you've really
grasped the fact of modeling.

26:33.260 --> 26:36.536
Our issue with you
has always been

26:36.536 --> 26:39.078
what type of model
is Tatiana?

26:39.078 --> 26:40.883
And I think I've always
found you really commercial.

26:40.883 --> 26:43.725
Graham:
I love this picture.

26:43.725 --> 26:45.597
And like Rita said,
we've been curious.

26:45.597 --> 26:47.770
"Can she be editorial
high fashion?"

26:47.770 --> 26:49.642
To me, this is what that
is. I think you look amazing.

26:49.642 --> 26:51.882
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

26:51.882 --> 26:53.253
In the last couple of
weeks I've been saying,

26:53.253 --> 26:54.891
"maybe Tati's
not a makeup girl.

26:54.891 --> 26:56.262
Maybe she doesn't
have the face

26:56.262 --> 26:58.168
that can carry
a lot of makeup."

26:58.168 --> 27:00.107
And I think this picture
fits in the pages of "Paper".

27:00.107 --> 27:03.751
So, congratulations,
Tatiana. You have proven me
wrong.

27:05.356 --> 27:10.437
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

27:10.437 --> 27:12.176
Drew:
<i>I think this look for you
is really great,</i>

27:12.176 --> 27:14.149
because it was showing you
as a boss, which I love.

27:14.149 --> 27:16.523
- Tatiana, thank you so
much. - Thank you guys so much.

27:16.523 --> 27:20.033
Up next, Coryanne.

27:20.033 --> 27:21.437
Should we take a look
at your best photo?

27:23.845 --> 27:26.018
Please?

27:26.018 --> 27:27.523
Rita:
You look a little bit
uncomfortable.

27:27.523 --> 27:28.860
I don't feel a complete
form of confidence

27:28.860 --> 27:31.334
coming out of you
in this photograph.

27:31.334 --> 27:33.039
Graham:
<i>I love this photo.</i>

27:33.039 --> 27:35.045
<i>You look like
you're having fun.</i>

27:35.045 --> 27:36.817
<i>You look like there's a man
that is tied around your leg</i>

27:36.817 --> 27:38.188
and you are like,
"You gotta come get it, honey."

27:38.188 --> 27:40.026
Uh-huh! See?

27:40.026 --> 27:42.735
You are a model.

27:42.735 --> 27:44.072
It's already been
determined for you.

27:44.072 --> 27:45.844
- Wow. Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

27:45.844 --> 27:46.714
Drew:
<i>I really like this photo.</i>

27:46.714 --> 27:48.284
<i>I think it's fun.</i>

27:48.284 --> 27:50.191
I think it's exactly the brief

27:50.191 --> 27:51.562
that was given to you
from the photographer.

27:51.562 --> 27:52.497
I think it's one
of your best pictures.

27:52.497 --> 27:54.403
But when I think about

27:54.403 --> 27:56.008
and I analyze
your body of work,

27:56.008 --> 27:56.843
would I see you on
the cover of "Paper"? No.

27:58.281 --> 28:00.522
Rita:
Thank you so much.

28:02.528 --> 28:04.098
All right, up next, India.

28:04.098 --> 28:05.469
Graham:
<i>I think you're beautiful,</i>

28:08.044 --> 28:09.816
but your actual image
wasn't the strongest.

28:09.816 --> 28:13.326
Rita: For me,
your quality is up there.

28:13.326 --> 28:14.964
You have that thing
that people can't buy,

28:14.964 --> 28:18.843
which is you're
mysterious.

28:18.843 --> 28:20.347
And so keeping that in mind,
great job.

28:20.347 --> 28:23.925
I want to disagree with Rita.

28:23.925 --> 28:25.730
I think the mysteriousness
of you is your downfall.

28:25.730 --> 28:29.475
To become the winner
of this competition

28:29.475 --> 28:31.615
and to exemplify
those three B's,

28:31.615 --> 28:34.189
I think that's where
you have a problem.

28:34.189 --> 28:35.024
I love this photograph.

28:37.933 --> 28:39.271
<i>I agree, the boss, brand,
and business</i>

28:39.271 --> 28:41.211
is a challenge for you.

28:41.211 --> 28:43.851
But what I will say,

28:43.851 --> 28:45.289
you always
take my breath away

28:45.289 --> 28:46.727
every single time
we show your photos.

28:46.727 --> 28:48.464
And you are a superstar.

28:48.464 --> 28:51.976
Thank you, Drew.

28:51.976 --> 28:53.681
India, thank
you very much.

28:53.681 --> 28:55.987
Thank you, guys.

28:55.987 --> 28:57.291
So now that we've reviewed
your "Paper" shoot,

28:57.291 --> 28:59.966
the question is,

28:59.966 --> 29:00.802
which one of you is being
eliminated right now.

29:03.578 --> 29:05.147
The judges have already
deliberated,

29:07.923 --> 29:10.999
and so the name
that I call

29:10.999 --> 29:11.902
will not be moving forward
in this competition.

29:11.902 --> 29:13.071
And that name is...

29:27.080 --> 29:31.394
The judges have already
deliberated,

29:31.394 --> 29:33.968
and so the name
that I call

29:33.968 --> 29:35.138
will not be moving forward
in this competition.

29:35.138 --> 29:36.710
And that name is...

29:37.747 --> 29:39.116
Coryanne.

29:42.427 --> 29:42.594
I'm sorry,
but your journey ends here.

29:45.670 --> 29:47.610
But thank you so much
for being here.

29:47.610 --> 29:50.919
Thank you.

29:50.919 --> 29:52.958
Coryanne:
I feel a little numb,
honestly.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.299
I gave everything that I have
into this competition.

29:55.299 --> 29:58.475
<i>Throughout every
single week,</i>

29:58.475 --> 30:00.982
<i>I grew so much as a model
and a person.</i>

30:00.982 --> 30:04.760
<i>This competition mended my
relationship with my mom,</i>

30:04.760 --> 30:07.636
<i>and the modeling experience
I gained was incredible.</i>

30:07.636 --> 30:11.046
<i>Some models would
work a lifetime</i>

30:11.046 --> 30:12.985
<i>to get to work with some
of the people I did.</i>

30:12.985 --> 30:14.356
<i>And I wasn't meant to be
America's Next Top Model,</i>

30:14.356 --> 30:15.827
<i>but this isn't the end.</i>

30:15.827 --> 30:17.331
You'll see me.

30:17.331 --> 30:19.404
Big things.

30:19.404 --> 30:19.672
Tatiana and India,
will you please step forward?

30:27.094 --> 30:30.705
We will now review
your final runway walk
for The Blonds.

30:30.705 --> 30:34.382
The judges will deliberate
and determine the winner

30:34.382 --> 30:38.562
of "America's Next Top Model".

30:38.562 --> 30:39.698
India, let's take a look
at your runway walk.

30:42.541 --> 30:45.047
Roach:
When you walked out,
we heard applause.

30:45.047 --> 30:46.853
Rita:
<i>Nobody has a round
of applause at a runway.</i>

30:46.853 --> 30:49.862
It is, like, usually dead.

30:49.862 --> 30:51.701
Drew:
The opening of the door--
spectacular,

30:51.701 --> 30:53.775
and you hit that pose
which you are amazing at doing.

30:53.775 --> 30:57.786
There was one point
where you put your hands up

30:57.786 --> 31:00.259
<i>and you didn't commit and
you took them back down.</i>

31:00.259 --> 31:02.500
<i>Inside, I cringed.</i>

31:02.500 --> 31:04.305
But you were like,
"I made a mistake
and here we go!"

31:04.305 --> 31:07.013
Roach:
<i>You crossed your legs</i>

31:07.013 --> 31:08.451
<i>at the end
of the runway one time.</i>

31:08.451 --> 31:09.622
Had that been
a traditional runway,

31:09.622 --> 31:11.327
you would have not
been booked again.

31:11.327 --> 31:14.603
All right, so now
let's move on to Tatiana.

31:14.603 --> 31:17.444
<i>I think that people
were actually in awe of you</i>

31:17.444 --> 31:21.022
because they'd never seen
so much swag walk down a runway.

31:21.022 --> 31:22.928
And that's a testament,
to go back to your personality
and your presence--

31:22.928 --> 31:27.810
- you are a superstar.
- Thank you.

31:27.810 --> 31:30.116
You have shown us throughout
this whole competition

31:30.116 --> 31:33.828
that you are a boss.

31:33.828 --> 31:36.301
Could you book a runway?
A hundred percent.

31:36.301 --> 31:38.508
<i>Would you be the star of
that runway? I don't know.</i>

31:38.508 --> 31:42.688
Rita:
Models, what a journey
you've been on,

31:42.688 --> 31:45.530
but this part of your
journey is coming to an end.

31:45.530 --> 31:48.003
The judges are going to
battle it out,

31:48.003 --> 31:50.209
and when you return,

31:50.209 --> 31:52.149
we will announce

31:52.149 --> 31:53.353
who is
America's Next Top Model.

31:53.353 --> 31:56.395
Thank you.

31:56.395 --> 31:57.599
( whispering )

31:58.869 --> 31:59.370
All right, guys,
we are down to the final two,

32:03.717 --> 32:06.392
and it's time for
our final deliberation.

32:06.392 --> 32:09.434
I will say, as a supermodel,

32:09.434 --> 32:10.739
my personality has gotten
me where I am today.

32:10.739 --> 32:13.581
And every supermodel
that I know,

32:13.581 --> 32:16.757
they have a game plan.

32:16.757 --> 32:18.293
It's not just the fact
that they are a pretty face.

32:18.293 --> 32:20.935
And that's why
I have to say Tatiana.

32:20.935 --> 32:23.410
India, I'd look
at her picture all day.

32:23.410 --> 32:26.786
I will triple like it
every single time
I see it on a timeline.

32:26.786 --> 32:29.562
And, hey,
in a few years' time,

32:29.562 --> 32:32.002
she may be like Tyra--

32:32.002 --> 32:35.278
has her own production
company, has her own show,

32:35.278 --> 32:37.620
is an amazing supermodel

32:37.620 --> 32:40.292
and I see a winner
like how I see Tyra.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.670
We cannot compare
India and Tyra.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.475
- I am sorry.
- India ain't no Tyra.

32:45.475 --> 32:48.686
- Period.
- No one even said that.

32:48.686 --> 32:50.055
You guys need
to chill out.

32:50.055 --> 32:50.289
- Well, hello.
- Aah!

32:52.028 --> 32:57.344
I was in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd just--

32:57.344 --> 32:58.649
It wouldn't be a final
without Miss Queen herself
coming to the final.

32:58.649 --> 33:02.828
Oh!

33:02.828 --> 33:04.131
There's only one
Miss Tyra Banks,

33:04.131 --> 33:05.737
can we just say?

33:05.737 --> 33:07.676
Hi!

33:07.676 --> 33:09.882
Oh!

33:09.882 --> 33:12.089
Are we making a chair
for you up here?

33:12.089 --> 33:13.092
I think we are making
a chair for me up here.

33:13.092 --> 33:15.331
Oh, my gosh!

33:15.331 --> 33:16.937
It is good to be here
with you guys!

33:16.937 --> 33:18.509
I've been watching these girls
and their progress,

33:18.509 --> 33:21.518
and they've come so far.

33:21.518 --> 33:22.754
It has been such
a crazy journey

33:22.754 --> 33:25.194
kind of getting down
to these bottom two.

33:25.194 --> 33:28.169
And I think it's time
we used some Tyra help.

33:28.169 --> 33:32.248
- Don't you think, guys?
- Yes, please! It's too hard.

33:32.248 --> 33:35.124
- I think we saved
the best till last.
- The queen is here.

33:35.124 --> 33:37.229
The queen has arrived,
and now you are here,
this is the thing.

33:37.229 --> 33:41.042
It's like,
what type of winner
are we looking for?

33:41.042 --> 33:43.917
We have a boss in Tatiana.
We have brand in Tatiana.

33:43.917 --> 33:47.929
But then again,
if I had to pick
between a photograph,

33:47.929 --> 33:50.505
<i>of course
it's going to be India.</i>

33:50.505 --> 33:52.477
The thing about these girls,

33:52.477 --> 33:53.947
they both have exactly
what the other girl needs.

33:53.947 --> 33:57.725
Don't you wish you could
just put 'em in a blender?

33:57.725 --> 33:59.599
- Yes.
- But not hurt 'em.

33:59.599 --> 34:00.935
- Right!
- Right!

34:00.935 --> 34:02.941
And so the question is,

34:02.941 --> 34:05.080
do you chose the one
that is the model model

34:05.080 --> 34:07.622
and then put a machine behind
her to make her work?

34:07.622 --> 34:09.962
Or do you chose the one
that is the brand,

34:09.962 --> 34:12.604
business, and boss,

34:12.604 --> 34:14.041
and put a machine
to make her work.

34:14.041 --> 34:16.549
- A model?
- Right.

34:16.549 --> 34:17.619
You know what I'm saying?

34:17.619 --> 34:18.822
Yes. Right now, to me,

34:18.822 --> 34:20.226
it's easier to have the boss,

34:20.226 --> 34:22.132
the brand, the presence.

34:22.132 --> 34:23.468
See, I disagree with that.

34:23.468 --> 34:25.510
Because I think that India

34:25.510 --> 34:27.347
was able to do
the Rimmel London challenge

34:27.347 --> 34:29.019
and she was able to to
the Nikola high fashion one.

34:29.019 --> 34:32.898
So I think that in that
we do have someone

34:32.898 --> 34:34.837
that can be moldable
as that brand,

34:34.837 --> 34:36.006
and then carry a brand,
like, a Kendall Jenner.

34:36.006 --> 34:39.316
Let's talk about Kendall
and Kylie.

34:39.316 --> 34:41.557
Like, I'm a huge fan.

34:41.557 --> 34:43.161
I've defended them publically.

34:43.161 --> 34:45.067
<i>Kendall-- high
fashion girl.</i>

34:45.067 --> 34:46.706
Tall, books all the campaigns,
has a makeup contract.

34:46.706 --> 34:50.718
Kylie--
not a high fashion girl,

34:50.718 --> 34:53.424
but books high fashion stuff
and has a cosmetics line

34:53.424 --> 34:57.070
- that's killing it!
- That's popping.

34:57.070 --> 34:58.609
We have a Kylie
and we have a Kendall.

34:58.609 --> 34:59.711
Law, I want you
to think about

35:01.584 --> 35:04.124
who do you want to dress?

35:04.124 --> 35:06.130
And who do you think
the world would look at

35:06.130 --> 35:08.403
that girl in these clothes
that you put on her,

35:08.403 --> 35:10.979
and they'd want
to buy those clothes?

35:10.979 --> 35:13.051
And then, Drew,
I want you to think about

35:13.051 --> 35:16.094
who do you want in the pages
of "Paper" magazine,

35:16.094 --> 35:18.433
and who do you think
all of your competitors
want to book?

35:18.433 --> 35:22.513
And then
I look to you, Ashley,

35:22.513 --> 35:25.923
which of these two girls

35:25.923 --> 35:27.293
can put the word "super"
in front of "model"

35:27.293 --> 35:30.436
nine months from now?

35:30.436 --> 35:32.342
And, Rita,

35:32.342 --> 35:34.515
I look to you to say

35:34.515 --> 35:36.656
who do you think is more
than just a model?

35:36.656 --> 35:41.135
And in thinking
about those questions,

35:41.135 --> 35:45.480
I leave it to you four
to decide

35:45.480 --> 35:47.689
who is America's Next
Top Model.

35:47.689 --> 35:50.731
And on that, Ty-ty.

35:50.731 --> 35:53.238
- Peace out.
- No!

35:53.238 --> 35:55.077
Don't leave.

35:55.077 --> 35:56.014
Don't leave us, Tyra!

35:56.014 --> 35:58.554
No!

35:58.554 --> 36:00.492
And that is how
you make an exit.

36:00.492 --> 36:01.529
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

36:12.428 --> 36:17.410
Okay, so I guess we really
have to decide now.

36:17.410 --> 36:19.785
Rita: Let's take a look
at their body of work,

36:19.785 --> 36:22.627
<i>starting with India.</i>

36:22.627 --> 36:24.800
<i>If we just go back
to the start,</i>

36:24.800 --> 36:27.742
<i>I'm looking at a girl
that doesn't know what,</i>

36:27.742 --> 36:30.618
<i>who, where,
when to superstar.</i>

36:30.618 --> 36:32.924
She has made
the biggest transformation,

36:32.924 --> 36:34.964
and it's incredible.

36:34.964 --> 36:36.300
India always takes
amazing pictures,

36:36.300 --> 36:38.908
but for me,
not a lot of star quality.

36:38.908 --> 36:41.751
For Tatiana,
it's the total opposite.

36:41.751 --> 36:44.592
They're like
day and night.

36:44.592 --> 36:46.597
Tatiana definitely
has star quality.

36:46.597 --> 36:49.606
Graham:
<i>For me, Tatiana has
the "it" factor.</i>

36:49.606 --> 36:52.014
<i>I'm thinking back to the
Ellen Von Unworth shoot.</i>

36:52.014 --> 36:54.488
<i>She is the boss, the brand,
and the business.</i>

36:54.488 --> 36:57.363
<i>She has the personality,
the style, the swag.</i>

36:57.363 --> 37:01.342
And she is somebody
that I want to be around.

37:01.342 --> 37:03.850
The thing that I think
India's lacking,

37:03.850 --> 37:06.558
is the confidence
to be a persona

37:06.558 --> 37:10.069
that is a "I have it all
and you want to be me."

37:10.069 --> 37:13.546
Over time,
you can create a superstar.

37:13.546 --> 37:16.723
- I believe that.
- She doesn't have it.

37:16.723 --> 37:19.530
- Ooh, she does.
- She does have it.

37:19.530 --> 37:21.704
- I'm telling you.
- Well, I was always told

37:21.704 --> 37:23.743
to never fall in love
with someone's potential.

37:23.743 --> 37:27.722
Take all of Tatiana's
pictures from this competition

37:27.722 --> 37:30.898
and take all of India's
pictures from this competition.

37:30.898 --> 37:33.707
We voted on them
five times for India
and one for Tatiana.

37:33.707 --> 37:37.752
Okay, but it's not just about
having a great photo anymore.

37:37.752 --> 37:40.593
So far what we've heard
from Tatiana

37:40.593 --> 37:42.131
is she wants to sell lotion.

37:42.131 --> 37:44.103
I would take Tatiana.

37:44.103 --> 37:45.608
I would change her
and dress her

37:45.608 --> 37:47.313
and take Tatiana
to Paris Fashion Week.

37:47.313 --> 37:49.286
Not even walk in a show.
Not even be invited to a show.

37:49.286 --> 37:52.094
- Sit front row.
- Not even sit front row.

37:52.094 --> 37:53.901
Just get the paparazzi shots.

37:53.901 --> 37:55.773
And I'll take India,

37:55.773 --> 37:57.778
and I will take her,
and I will redo her,

37:57.778 --> 37:59.550
and I will turn her into
the biggest social media star

37:59.550 --> 38:02.424
on the cover of magazines,

38:02.424 --> 38:03.629
because she already
has what it takes

38:03.629 --> 38:05.301
- to be a model.
- But you're an editor.

38:05.301 --> 38:06.739
And you can sell lotion,
and I will sell a brand.

38:06.739 --> 38:09.178
Make it to top three,
I was like... ( gasps )

38:11.653 --> 38:13.994
Making it to top two,
it's like ( gasps )

38:13.994 --> 38:15.999
- Like, I can't even.
- Top four, it hit me.

38:15.999 --> 38:17.805
I don't know.
It's just insane to be here.

38:17.805 --> 38:20.378
I don't even know
how to explain it.

38:20.378 --> 38:22.050
I just think it's crazy
how different we are,

38:22.050 --> 38:25.060
and they're going to get
pretty much one or the other.

38:25.060 --> 38:29.172
I'm lacking in
certain areas,

38:29.172 --> 38:30.509
you're lacking
in certain areas.

38:30.509 --> 38:32.047
We're flawed in
opposite ways,

38:32.047 --> 38:33.619
but they both
can be worked on.

38:33.619 --> 38:35.156
Yeah.

38:35.156 --> 38:36.293
Have we come
to a decision?

38:36.293 --> 38:38.233
- Yes.
- I think so.

38:38.233 --> 38:39.703
- Oui, madame.
- Okay.

38:39.703 --> 38:41.374
Let's do this.

38:46.157 --> 38:49.767
Will Tatiana and India
please step forward?

38:57.590 --> 39:01.871
Before I announce the winner
of "America's Next Top Model,"

39:01.871 --> 39:06.416
I want to say one thing.

39:06.416 --> 39:06.751
The deliberation
that we've had tonight

39:09.392 --> 39:11.398
was the most
heated and contentious
one we've ever had.

39:11.398 --> 39:14.809
We literally could not
come to a decision.

39:15.711 --> 39:17.550
But we have to pick one winner,

39:20.092 --> 39:21.662
and that winner is...

39:35.671 --> 39:39.918
India.

39:39.918 --> 39:40.820
Congratulations, India.

39:43.127 --> 39:44.833
( muttering )

39:44.833 --> 39:46.704
Oh, my gosh.

39:46.704 --> 39:48.510
Tatiana, come here.

39:50.281 --> 39:53.491
You are a boss.

39:53.491 --> 39:56.066
You have the personality,

39:56.066 --> 39:58.206
you have the drive
and the beauty

39:58.206 --> 40:00.379
to succeed in this business.

40:00.379 --> 40:03.689
We are all
rooting for you.

40:03.689 --> 40:05.728
- Thank you so, so much.
- Thank you so much
for everything.

40:05.728 --> 40:08.537
Tatiana:
Congrats to India, honestly.

40:08.537 --> 40:10.375
Thank you so much,
everybody, for this opportunity.

40:10.375 --> 40:12.549
- Thank you.
- We love you, Tati.

40:12.549 --> 40:14.387
Tatiana:
Seeing India's picture
on the screen,

40:14.387 --> 40:15.223
<i>I mean, I
definitely am sad</i>

40:15.223 --> 40:17.263
that I didn't win.

40:17.263 --> 40:19.202
But at the same time,

40:19.202 --> 40:20.239
<i>I'm ready to take this
and run with it</i>

40:20.239 --> 40:21.074
<i>and see where it goes.</i>

40:21.074 --> 40:22.344
This is not going to be

40:22.344 --> 40:23.248
the last time anyone sees me.

40:23.248 --> 40:24.383
Oh, congratulations.

40:26.423 --> 40:29.766
- I made it.
- You made it!

40:29.766 --> 40:33.779
( squealing )

40:33.779 --> 40:36.086
I'm so proud of you.

40:36.086 --> 40:38.459
India: I cannot believe
this just happened.

40:38.459 --> 40:39.931
I'm just filled
with so much joy.

40:39.931 --> 40:42.070
I'm so proud of myself.

40:42.070 --> 40:43.609
<i>I owe the opportunity
to the judges, really.</i>

40:43.609 --> 40:44.578
<i>They're the ones
who believed in me</i>

40:44.578 --> 40:45.814
and pushed me to improve

40:45.814 --> 40:47.452
and become
America's Next Top Model,

40:47.452 --> 40:49.626
who I am today.

40:49.626 --> 40:50.829
<i>I have a lot
to live up to</i>

40:50.829 --> 40:52.836
<i>and a reputation
to uphold.</i>

40:52.836 --> 40:55.010
<i>I hope to be
on movie screens,</i>

40:55.010 --> 40:57.584
<i>be in the biggest
magazines.</i>

40:57.584 --> 40:59.790
<i>And keep your
eye out for that,</i>

40:59.790 --> 41:01.529
<i>because I'm going to use
all these different things</i>

41:01.529 --> 41:03.000
<i>that I have going in my head
to become a mogul</i>

41:03.000 --> 41:05.808
<i>who has the boss,
business, brand</i>

41:05.808 --> 41:07.046
that they've been looking for
in this competition.

41:07.046 --> 41:09.853
We believe in you.

41:09.853 --> 41:11.124
Your potential,
like I've said throughout
this whole competition,

41:11.124 --> 41:13.464
is through the roof.

41:13.464 --> 41:15.203
Congratulations
on the new season

41:15.203 --> 41:16.641
of "America's Next Top
