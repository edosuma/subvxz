you're an excellent teacher,

And I've continued to

13:36.318 --> 13:39.519
No, it's... (sighs)
I can't fail this class.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.653
Oh, don't sell yourself short,
Mr. Kountze.

13:41.653 --> 13:43.655
I truly believe that you can.

13:43.655 --> 13:45.690
I'm supposed to go to Cornell.

13:45.690 --> 13:47.725
Unlikely.

13:47.725 --> 13:50.332
Please, sir.
My dad's going to flip out.

13:50.332 --> 13:53.632
(students murmuring)

13:55.141 --> 13:57.438
All right. All right.

13:57.438 --> 13:59.671
Uh, in the spirit of the season,

13:59.671 --> 14:01.442
I suppose the most
constructive way

14:01.442 --> 14:03.378
of dealing with
your shortcomings

14:03.378 --> 14:07.019
is to offer a makeup exam.

14:07.019 --> 14:09.615
You'll all get a second run
at this after break.

14:09.615 --> 14:13.124
(students sighing, murmuring)

14:13.124 --> 14:15.929
Of course, it will not
be the same exam.

14:15.929 --> 14:18.129
You will now be responsible
for new material as well.

14:18.129 --> 14:19.856
(students groaning, murmuring)

14:19.856 --> 14:21.858
Your grade will be
an average of the two.

14:21.858 --> 14:24.300
Please open your books
to chapter six.

14:24.300 --> 14:27.270
The Peloponnesian War, gentlemen.

14:27.270 --> 14:28.942
You've already met Pericles.

14:28.942 --> 14:31.571
Now prepare yourselves
to meet Demosthenes.

14:31.571 --> 14:34.310
No offense, sir,
but is this really

14:34.310 --> 14:36.576
the best time to be starting
a new chapter?

14:36.576 --> 14:41.284
I mean, we all appreciate the,
uh, makeup exam gesture,

14:41.284 --> 14:44.221
but our families are here.

14:44.221 --> 14:46.388
You know, most teachers
have already canceled class.

14:46.388 --> 14:48.720
We have chapel in 40 minutes,
then we're out of here.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.426
- Mm.
- I mean,
our heads are elsewhere.

14:51.426 --> 14:54.924
And where exactly
is your head, Mr. Tully?

14:54.924 --> 14:56.629
Um, I don't know.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.070
St. Kitts. (chuckles)

14:58.070 --> 14:59.137
(chuckles)

14:59.137 --> 15:00.501
Yes, indeed.

15:00.501 --> 15:02.503
I see you've brought
your valise.

15:03.506 --> 15:05.308
Spot-on, sir.

15:05.308 --> 15:07.981
It's just that it's been
a really exhausting semester.

15:07.981 --> 15:11.677
Getting into new material now
right before break?

15:11.677 --> 15:14.482
Honestly, it's a little absurd.

15:14.482 --> 15:15.813
Sir.

15:18.851 --> 15:22.028
Well, I would hate to be absurd.

15:22.028 --> 15:25.427
So let's just scuttle
the whole thing, shall we,

15:25.427 --> 15:27.693
and let the original
grades stand.

15:27.693 --> 15:30.135
(students groaning, murmuring)

15:30.135 --> 15:31.697
Uh, excuse me, sir.

15:31.697 --> 15:34.667
I think, uh, we all liked
the first option better.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.768
What'd you say the guy's
name was? Uh, Demosthe-who?

15:36.768 --> 15:39.210
Of course, I still expect you
to be familiar with chapter six

15:39.210 --> 15:42.378
upon your return,
so pack those textbooks, boys.

15:42.378 --> 15:44.380
And if displeased,

15:44.380 --> 15:47.482
take it up with
your champion-- Mr. Tully.

15:48.419 --> 15:50.056
Dismissed.

15:51.092 --> 15:54.654
(whistling
"Ride of the Valkyries")

15:54.654 --> 15:56.491
(students murmuring)

15:56.491 --> 15:58.823
I got us out early, didn't I?

15:59.760 --> 16:01.826
(church organ playing)

16:05.535 --> 16:10.736
CHOIR and CONGREGATION:
♪ Born thy people to deliver ♪

16:10.736 --> 16:15.642
♪ Born a child and yet a king ♪

16:15.642 --> 16:20.548
♪ Born to reign in us forever ♪

16:20.548 --> 16:26.554
♪ Now thy gracious
kingdom bring. ♪

16:28.525 --> 16:29.953
Please be seated.

16:32.595 --> 16:36.432
Welcome, Barton students,
faculty and parents.

16:36.432 --> 16:39.336
I know you're all anxious
to start the holidays.

16:39.336 --> 16:42.273
I can see the boys
shifting in their seats.

16:42.273 --> 16:44.341
- (laughter)
- But before we release you

16:44.341 --> 16:47.443
to your bountiful tables
and the blessings of family,

16:47.443 --> 16:50.083
let us pray for those
less fortunate than we.

16:51.449 --> 16:55.044
Let us remember the poor
and the helpless,

16:55.044 --> 16:58.124
the cold, the hungry
and the oppressed.

16:59.259 --> 17:01.688
Extra reading over vacation
and no makeup test?

17:01.688 --> 17:03.459
Are you fucking kidding me?

17:03.459 --> 17:05.131
Nice work, anus.

17:05.131 --> 17:07.023
Can you not talk, please?
I'm trying to pray.

17:07.023 --> 17:09.025
You better pray
I don't catch you alone,

17:09.025 --> 17:11.731
because I will full-on
nut-punch you.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.304
Tone it down.

17:13.304 --> 17:15.273
- Jesus can hear you.
- PRIEST: ...and all those

17:15.273 --> 17:18.144
who know not
the loving kindness of God.

17:18.144 --> 17:20.311
Sorry to hear about
your mother, Endicott.

17:20.311 --> 17:21.741
What?

17:21.741 --> 17:23.809
Oh. Yes.

17:23.809 --> 17:25.217
Thank you.

17:25.217 --> 17:27.285
Yeah. We're all pulling for her.

17:27.285 --> 17:28.979
PRIEST:
...and your grace.

17:28.979 --> 17:32.983
And finally, let us pray
for the soul of Curtis Lamb,

17:32.983 --> 17:35.656
Barton class of 1969.

17:35.656 --> 17:38.626
Just this year,
Curtis gave his life valiantly

17:38.626 --> 17:40.826
in the service of his country.

17:40.826 --> 17:44.269
And let us once again extend
our deepest condolences

17:44.269 --> 17:47.096
to one of the most cherished
members of the Barton family,

17:47.096 --> 17:48.801
his mother Mary.

17:49.804 --> 17:52.101
Mary, we remember Curtis

17:52.101 --> 17:54.675
as such an outstanding
and promising young man,

17:54.675 --> 17:57.282
and we know this holiday season

17:57.282 --> 18:00.252
will be especially difficult
without him.

18:00.252 --> 18:04.355
Please know that we
accompany you in your grief.

18:05.886 --> 18:08.260
May the all-powerful God
who protected Abraham

18:08.260 --> 18:12.088
when he left his native land
protect all our brave soldiers

18:12.088 --> 18:15.366
until they are delivered
safely home to us.

18:15.366 --> 18:18.028
We ask this through
Christ our Lord.

18:18.028 --> 18:19.469
Amen.

18:19.469 --> 18:21.471
CONGREGATION:
Amen.

18:21.471 --> 18:24.133
I wish you all
a very Merry Christmas.

18:24.133 --> 18:27.510
Or, as the case may be,
a very Happy Hanukkah.

18:27.510 --> 18:29.512
(light laughter)

18:29.512 --> 18:31.580
(organ playing
"Joy to the World")

18:37.819 --> 18:39.852
(quiet chatter)

18:43.022 --> 18:45.693
DR. WOODRUP: Congressman,
Merry Christmas to you.

18:45.693 --> 18:48.828
(overlapping chatter,
Christmas greetings)

18:48.828 --> 18:50.632
Merry Christmas, everyone.

18:50.632 --> 18:52.062
Merry Christmas.

18:52.062 --> 18:53.470
Hey. Good to see you.

18:53.470 --> 18:55.406
Nice to see you.
Merry Christmas.

18:55.406 --> 18:57.507
(chatter continues)

19:02.041 --> 19:03.711
Angus Tully.

19:03.711 --> 19:05.548
You have a phone call.

19:10.918 --> 19:12.885
ANGUS:
<i>You're telling me this now?</i>

19:12.885 --> 19:14.326
JUDY (over phone):
Sweetheart, listen.

19:14.326 --> 19:16.394
I know it's last minute,
and I am...

19:16.394 --> 19:18.396
I'm absolutely heartbroken,

19:18.396 --> 19:20.156
but could you please
see your way

19:20.156 --> 19:23.093
to staying at school over break
just this once?

19:23.093 --> 19:25.095
Stanley has been working
so hard,

19:25.095 --> 19:27.273
and-and we've had no time
for a honeymoon.

19:27.273 --> 19:29.506
You guys have been married
since July.

19:29.506 --> 19:30.936
You've had all these months.

19:30.936 --> 19:32.740
Something's always come up.

19:32.740 --> 19:34.676
I know it's a lot to ask,

19:34.676 --> 19:37.250
but you know
how lonely I've been.

19:37.250 --> 19:38.944
I've been lonely too.

19:38.944 --> 19:40.847
And what about Boston?

19:40.847 --> 19:43.916
You promised on the way
we'd spend some time in Boston.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.083
Angus, listen to me.

19:46.083 --> 19:48.294
This is our new family, okay?

19:48.294 --> 19:50.725
I know you miss your father--
I do, too--

19:50.725 --> 19:53.123
but there's someone new
in my life.

19:53.123 --> 19:55.400
It's just this once, darling.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.028
We'll be together
at spring break,

19:57.028 --> 19:58.436
and we'll have the whole summer.

19:58.436 --> 20:00.196
Fuck the summer,
and fuck Stanley.

20:00.196 --> 20:02.033
Angus.

20:02.033 --> 20:03.639
Are you kidding me?

20:03.639 --> 20:05.410
I'm just supposed to stay here?

20:05.410 --> 20:06.807
(Judy sighs)

20:06.807 --> 20:10.041
Mom, please don't do this.

20:10.041 --> 20:12.109
Please.

20:12.109 --> 20:14.111
PAUL:
<i>I suspect that, like me,</i>

20:14.111 --> 20:16.619
this is not how you wanted
to spend your holidays,

20:16.619 --> 20:19.215
but such are
the vicissitudes of life.

20:19.215 --> 20:21.294
And as Barton men,

20:21.294 --> 20:23.593
we learn to confront
our challenges

20:23.593 --> 20:25.925
with heads held high
and with a spirit

20:25.925 --> 20:27.828
of courage and good fellowship.

20:27.828 --> 20:29.764
Uh, in strict accordance
with the dictates

20:29.764 --> 20:32.371
of the manual, of course.

20:34.606 --> 20:37.838
Mr. Tully,
are you joining us as well?

20:37.838 --> 20:39.774
What happened to St. Kitts?

20:41.008 --> 20:43.316
Something came up.

20:47.553 --> 20:49.487
(suitcase thuds loudly on floor)

20:50.985 --> 20:52.589
(Paul clears throat)

20:52.589 --> 20:54.525
So, for the next two weeks,

20:54.525 --> 20:57.154
we will be following
a standard school schedule...

20:57.154 --> 20:59.464
Sir? Uh, sir, we're on vacation.

20:59.464 --> 21:01.697
...which means we will be
taking our meals together,

21:01.697 --> 21:04.095
and you will observe
regular hours of study.

21:04.095 --> 21:06.768
Study? Are you kidding me?

21:06.768 --> 21:08.605
The Peloponnesian War awaits,
Mr. Kountze.

21:08.605 --> 21:10.299
You and Mr. Tully.

21:10.299 --> 21:12.444
The rest of you can get a jump
on the next semester.

21:12.444 --> 21:14.644
It'll pay off. You'll see.

21:14.644 --> 21:15.975
We're already holding over,

21:15.975 --> 21:17.614
and now we're being
punished for it?

21:17.614 --> 21:20.012
You will be afforded
limited windows for recreation

21:20.012 --> 21:22.212
and supervised
physical activity.

21:22.212 --> 21:24.214
The gym's not even open yet.

21:24.214 --> 21:25.985
Yeah, they've only lacquered
half the floor.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.558
PAUL:
Fresh air will do you good.

21:27.558 --> 21:30.022
It's like 15 degrees outside.

21:30.022 --> 21:33.322
And the Romans bathed naked
in the freezing Tiber.

21:33.322 --> 21:36.061
Adversity builds character,
Mr. Tully.

21:36.061 --> 21:38.536
Uh, speaking of which,
the school will be cutting heat

21:38.536 --> 21:40.373
to dormitories
and faculty housing,

21:40.373 --> 21:42.639
so we'll all be bunking
in the infirmary.

21:42.639 --> 21:44.872
(sighing):
Oh, God. Geez.

21:44.872 --> 21:46.973
("Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht
(Silent Night)" playing)

21:46.973 --> 21:49.305
ANGUS:
This is the most bullshit ever.

21:49.305 --> 21:51.417
If we have to stay,
why'd we have to draw Walleye?

21:51.417 --> 21:53.419
JASON: Uh, you know
he used to be a student, right?

21:53.419 --> 21:55.080
Yeah, that's why he knows
how to inflict

21:55.080 --> 21:57.148
maximum pain on us,
the sadistic fuck.

21:57.148 --> 21:58.886
TEDDY:
At least we didn't draw Decker.

21:58.886 --> 22:01.823
He'd be perving all over us.

22:01.823 --> 22:04.089
ANGUS:
Hey, guys, hold up for a second.

22:06.126 --> 22:07.829
Want one?

22:07.829 --> 22:09.897
TEDDY:
No. I got something else.

22:11.538 --> 22:14.000
Give me that.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.507
Hey, don't smoke that out here.

22:15.507 --> 22:17.102
I don't want to get busted
by Walleye.

22:17.102 --> 22:18.675
TEDDY:
Don't be such a pussy.

22:18.675 --> 22:20.171
ANGUS: I'm not a pussy.
I just don't want

22:20.171 --> 22:22.778
to end up at Fork Union
paying for your mistake.

22:24.144 --> 22:25.616
Teddy Kountze.

22:25.616 --> 22:26.848
Jason Smith.

22:26.848 --> 22:28.751
Yeah, I know who you are.

22:28.751 --> 22:30.720
Want to hit this?

22:30.720 --> 22:32.590
Uh, yeah.

22:35.419 --> 22:37.386
You got a great arm, man.

22:37.386 --> 22:38.926
Yeah, well, it's just football.

22:38.926 --> 22:40.697
So, how'd you get stuck
holding over?

22:40.697 --> 22:42.732
I'm supposed to be skiing
with my folks up at Haystack,

22:42.732 --> 22:44.261
but my dad put his foot down,

22:44.261 --> 22:46.032
said I can't come home
unless I cut my hair.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.067
(scoffs) So why don't you
just cut your hair?

22:48.067 --> 22:49.739
Civil disobedience, man.

22:49.739 --> 22:51.477
ANGUS:
Yeah, right.

22:51.477 --> 22:53.611
JASON: No, he's cool.
It's just a battle of wills.

22:53.611 --> 22:55.646
Still, I was kind of hoping
he'd cave first,

22:55.646 --> 22:58.341
because the powder up at
Haystack is so sweet right now.

22:59.652 --> 23:01.949
What about you, Mr. Moto?

23:01.949 --> 23:03.214
Why are you here?

23:03.214 --> 23:05.117
Uh, no. Uh, my name is Ye-Joon.

23:05.117 --> 23:07.053
Uh, my family is in Korea,

23:07.053 --> 23:09.825
and they think it's too far
for me to travel alone.

23:09.825 --> 23:13.059
I figured it was because your
rickshaw was broken. (laughs)

23:13.059 --> 23:15.633
Uh, what-what's a rickshaw?

23:15.633 --> 23:17.261
- You're an asshole, Kountze.
- (sighs)

23:17.261 --> 23:19.131
Your mind's a cesspool
and a shallow one at that.

23:19.131 --> 23:20.968
Who's the asshole, Tully?

23:20.968 --> 23:22.772
You're the one
who blew up history.

23:22.772 --> 23:24.169
Hey.

23:24.169 --> 23:25.610
What's your story, man?

23:25.610 --> 23:27.436
Alex Ollerman.

23:27.436 --> 23:30.109
I'm here because my parents
are on a mission in Paraguay.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.781
We're LDS.

23:31.781 --> 23:33.651
JASON:
Mormons, right?

23:33.651 --> 23:36.445
Don't you guys wear some kind
of like magic underwear?

23:36.445 --> 23:38.084
ALEX:
That's a common misconception.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.756
Actually, it's called
a temple garment,

23:39.756 --> 23:41.593
and we're only supposed
to wear it when we...

23:41.593 --> 23:43.353
Hey, what's up with the townies?

23:43.353 --> 23:45.762
Hey, what are you doing
with our Christmas tree?

23:45.762 --> 23:48.127
The school sold it back to us.

23:48.127 --> 23:50.261
Scotch pine, still fresh.

23:50.261 --> 23:52.131
MAN 2: Yeah, we're going to
put it back on the lot.

23:52.131 --> 23:53.462
We do it every year.

23:53.462 --> 23:55.332
This is the most bullshit ever.

24:00.911 --> 24:02.614
Hello, Mary. (sighs)

24:02.614 --> 24:04.341
Mr. Hunham.

24:04.341 --> 24:06.882
I heard you got stuck with
babysitting duty this year.

24:06.882 --> 24:08.983
How'd you manage that?

24:08.983 --> 24:10.655
Oh, I don't know.

24:10.655 --> 24:12.888
I suppose I failed someone
who richly deserved it.

24:12.888 --> 24:15.451
Oh, the Osgood kid?

24:15.451 --> 24:17.387
Yeah, he was a real asshole.

24:17.387 --> 24:18.828
Rich and dumb.

24:18.828 --> 24:20.456
Popular combination around here.

24:20.456 --> 24:22.293
It's a plague.

24:22.293 --> 24:23.734
Uh, and you?

24:23.734 --> 24:25.296
You'll be here, too?

24:25.296 --> 24:27.364
All by my lonesome.

24:27.364 --> 24:29.674
My little sister Peggy
and her husband invited me

24:29.674 --> 24:33.975
to go visit them at Roxbury,
but I feel like it's too soon.

24:33.975 --> 24:36.582
Like Curtis will think
that I'm abandoning him.

24:36.582 --> 24:39.343
You know, this is the last place

24:39.343 --> 24:42.313
that my baby and I
were together,

24:42.313 --> 24:44.788
- not including the bus station.
- Yeah.

24:46.418 --> 24:49.155
Well, I look forward
to your fine cooking.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.761
Oh, no, no. Don't do that.

24:50.761 --> 24:53.027
All we've got is
whatever is in that walk-in.

24:53.027 --> 24:55.161
No new deliveries till January.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.866
Hmm.

24:58.529 --> 25:00.397
You mind if I, um...

25:02.269 --> 25:04.104
- You want some of that?
- Mm.

25:04.104 --> 25:06.612
- All right.
- (chuckles) Thank you.

25:06.612 --> 25:08.339
(Paul clears throat)

25:08.339 --> 25:10.506
- You know this is a necessity.

Where's your family?

25:58.092 --> 25:59.665
It's winter, idiot.

25:59.665 --> 26:01.766
Nobody renovates their house
in the winter.

26:01.766 --> 26:03.669
Your parents don't
want you around

you know you're an asshole.

26:13.646 --> 26:16.748
Plus, academically,
you're a disaster.

26:16.748 --> 26:20.477
I mean, if I were your parents,
I'd never want you home again.

Break it up. Break it up.
Break it up.

26:44.470 --> 26:45.843
They weren't fighting.

26:45.843 --> 26:47.471
I see.

26:47.471 --> 26:50.111
And who started it--
the not fighting?

26:50.111 --> 26:51.717
Hmm? Mr. Tully,

26:51.717 --> 26:54.577
perhaps you could shed
some light on the subject.

26:55.580 --> 26:56.986
Mr. Kountze?

26:56.986 --> 26:58.889
Mr. Smith?

26:58.889 --> 27:00.891
Mr. Ollerman?

27:00.891 --> 27:03.289
Mr. Park?

27:03.289 --> 27:07.128
All right, then, uh, we'll
do it like the Roman legions.

27:07.128 --> 27:09.328
Absent a confession,
one man's sin

27:09.328 --> 27:11.330
is every man's suffering.

27:11.330 --> 27:14.366
For every minute
the truth is withheld,

27:14.366 --> 27:17.039
you will all receive
a detention.

27:17.039 --> 27:19.811
And I thought all the Nazis
were hiding in Argentina.

27:19.811 --> 27:21.780
Stifle it, Tully.

27:24.114 --> 27:27.016
Now, uh, in the first
of said detentions,

27:27.016 --> 27:32.186
you will clean the library,
top to bottom.

27:32.186 --> 27:34.254
Scraping the underside
of the desks,

27:34.254 --> 27:37.422
which are caked
with snot and gum

27:37.422 --> 27:41.492
and all manner of ancient,
unspeakable proteins.

27:41.492 --> 27:45.232
Ah, on your hands and knees,
down in the dust,

27:45.232 --> 27:49.236
breathing in the dead skin
of generations of students

27:49.236 --> 27:52.437
and desiccated
cockroach assholes.

27:52.437 --> 27:53.878
It was Kountze!

27:53.878 --> 27:55.913
(Alex panting)

27:55.913 --> 27:57.915
Kountze started it.

27:58.918 --> 28:00.709
Bravo, Mr. Ollerman.

28:00.709 --> 28:03.052
Bravo.

28:04.088 --> 28:07.089
(quiet, indistinct chatter)

28:13.163 --> 28:14.965
(light laughter)

28:21.435 --> 28:23.732
Lovely.

28:23.732 --> 28:25.239
Thank you, Mary.

28:32.820 --> 28:34.611
Didn't we already
have this for lunch?

28:34.611 --> 28:36.217
And it was crappy then.

28:36.217 --> 28:37.790
PAUL:
Consider yourselves lucky.

28:37.790 --> 28:41.717
During the Third Punic campaign,
149 to 146 BC,

28:41.717 --> 28:43.796
the Romans laid siege
to Carthage

28:43.796 --> 28:45.963
for three entire years.

28:45.963 --> 28:47.756
- (door opens)
- By the time it ended,

28:47.756 --> 28:49.901
the Carthaginians
were reduced to eating sand

28:49.901 --> 28:51.903
and drinking their own urine.

28:51.903 --> 28:54.367
Hence the term "punitive."

28:56.305 --> 28:58.008
Uh... (sniffs) Mary?

28:58.008 --> 29:00.175
Maybe you would, uh...

29:00.175 --> 29:02.210
maybe you would care to join us?

29:09.219 --> 29:11.318
No, I'm all right. Thank you.

29:15.896 --> 29:18.754
(door opens and closes)

29:18.754 --> 29:21.966
I mean, I know she's sad
about her son and everything,

29:21.966 --> 29:24.529
but still, she's getting paid
to do a job,

29:24.529 --> 29:27.202
and she should do it well, right?

29:29.041 --> 29:31.272
But I guess, no matter
how bad a cook she is,

29:31.272 --> 29:32.977
now they can never fire her.

29:32.977 --> 29:35.738
Will you shut up!

29:38.347 --> 29:41.282
You have no idea what
that woman has been thr...

29:41.282 --> 29:42.987
(sighs)

29:47.422 --> 29:49.389
You know, Mr. Kountze,
for most people,

29:49.389 --> 29:51.457
life is like a henhouse ladder.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.294
Shitty and short.

29:53.294 --> 29:56.726
You were born lucky.

29:56.726 --> 29:58.904
Maybe someday, you entitled
little degenerates

29:58.904 --> 30:00.466
will appreciate that.

30:00.466 --> 30:03.040
If you don't,
I feel sorry for you

30:03.040 --> 30:05.240
and we will have failed
to do our jobs.

30:05.240 --> 30:07.275

30:55.125 --> 30:57.787
(cheering and applause over TV)

30:57.787 --> 30:59.690
Next question
for five points, girls.

30:59.690 --> 31:02.693
What are the dimensions
of the car you drive most?

31:02.693 --> 31:04.728
And that means width by length.

31:04.728 --> 31:06.730
The dimensions of the car
you drive most. Jerry?

31:06.730 --> 31:08.798
JERRY (over TV):
It's pretty long.

31:08.798 --> 31:11.636
Oh, let's see.
Maybe, uh, 8 by 80?

31:11.636 --> 31:13.737
(laughter over TV)

31:16.742 --> 31:18.148
EUBANKS: What's the name
of your car, Union Pacific?

31:18.148 --> 31:19.545
(Paul clears throat)

31:19.545 --> 31:22.086
- Oh, good evening.
- Good evening.

31:22.086 --> 31:23.813
What's this?

31:23.813 --> 31:25.749
You don't know
<i>The Newlywed Game?</i>

31:25.749 --> 31:27.916
- No.
- What planet
have you been living on?

31:27.916 --> 31:30.094
I don't really watch television.

31:30.094 --> 31:32.228
It's a show where
they ask couples questions

31:32.228 --> 31:34.230
to see how well
they know each other.

31:34.230 --> 31:36.001
That sounds like
courting disaster.

31:36.001 --> 31:39.004
Yeah, that's
the whole damn point.

31:39.004 --> 31:40.665
Sit down.

31:40.665 --> 31:42.172
Come on.

31:42.172 --> 31:44.273
Broaden your horizons.

31:46.937 --> 31:50.246
(sighs)
This is a rerun from July.

31:50.246 --> 31:52.578
Which is why they're playing
for Weber barbecues

31:52.578 --> 31:54.151
and picnic utensils.

31:54.151 --> 31:56.417
- PAUL: Fascinating.
- MARY: Mm-hmm.

31:56.417 --> 31:57.814
EUBANKS: If we ever take
separate vacations,

31:57.814 --> 31:59.288
I am sending my wife to blank...

31:59.288 --> 32:01.994
- Oh. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

32:01.994 --> 32:04.062
(chatter continues over TV)

32:06.462 --> 32:09.694
So, how are the boys?

32:09.694 --> 32:12.400
Broken in body and spirit.

32:13.799 --> 32:17.273
Okay, well, it is the holidays,
so, you know, go easy on them.

32:17.273 --> 32:18.769
Oh, please.

32:18.769 --> 32:21.145
They've had it easy
their whole lives.

32:21.145 --> 32:22.938
You don't know that.

32:22.938 --> 32:24.478
Did you?

32:25.976 --> 32:28.548
Besides, everybody should be
with their people on Christmas.

32:28.548 --> 32:30.286
- WOMAN: Hawaii, probably.
- EUBANKS: Hawaii. All right.

32:30.286 --> 32:31.551
He says he's gonna send you
to Santa Ana

32:31.551 --> 32:33.487
and he's going to Las Vegas.

32:33.487 --> 32:35.027
MAN: Nobody can watch you
in Siberia.

32:35.027 --> 32:36.721
Where are you going?

32:36.721 --> 32:38.888
- To Vegas.
- Las Vegas?

32:38.888 --> 32:41.561
- Yeah.
- (sighs)

32:41.561 --> 32:43.563
- No.
- (audience murmurs, laughs)

32:43.563 --> 32:45.895
Those two are going to get
a divorce.

32:45.895 --> 32:47.534
How do you know?

32:47.534 --> 32:49.668
I recognize that look
of stale disappointment.

32:49.668 --> 32:51.670
- (chuckling)
- She hates him.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.738
Oh.

32:53.738 --> 32:55.806
How long were you married?

32:55.806 --> 32:57.742
I was engaged
to Curtis's father.

32:57.742 --> 33:00.910
- Mm.
- But he died
before I gave birth.

33:00.910 --> 33:02.714
Harold.

33:02.714 --> 33:05.255
He worked in the shipyard.

33:05.255 --> 33:07.752
And one day, they was
carrying this big, uh,

33:07.752 --> 33:11.162
cargo pallet,
and the cable snapped.

33:11.162 --> 33:13.065
Hit him right across the head.

33:15.531 --> 33:17.234
They were good men.

33:17.234 --> 33:18.730
Both of them.

33:18.730 --> 33:22.030
And neither of them
made it to 25.

33:22.030 --> 33:24.604
My baby wasn't even 20.

33:25.937 --> 33:28.212
I'm so sorry.

33:28.212 --> 33:31.215
I took this job
when Curtis was small

33:31.215 --> 33:32.942
because I wanted to ensure

33:32.942 --> 33:35.010
that he was going to have
a good education.

33:35.010 --> 33:37.551
- You know he flourished here.
- Yes. No, he was a great kid.

33:37.551 --> 33:38.948
- I had him one semester.
- Mm-hmm.

33:38.948 --> 33:40.587
Very insightful.

33:40.587 --> 33:42.655
Mm-hmm. He hated you.

33:44.131 --> 33:46.329
He said you were a real asshole.

33:47.398 --> 33:50.399
Well, uh, like I said...
(chuckles)

33:50.399 --> 33:52.500
sharp kid. Insightful.

33:55.769 --> 33:58.737
He had his heart set
on Swarthmore.

33:58.737 --> 34:01.575
And he had the grades,
but I didn't have the money.

34:01.575 --> 34:04.644
Even with financial aid,
it wasn't enough.

34:04.644 --> 34:08.879
So, when he got called up
and no student deferment,

34:08.879 --> 34:10.749
off he went.

49:10.318 --> 49:11.814
Mr. Tully, what are you doing?

49:11.814 --> 49:13.222
Uh, no, no credit card.

49:13.222 --> 49:14.619
I'll pay cash
or traveler's checks.

49:14.619 --> 49:15.950
I didn't say
you could use the phone.

49:15.950 --> 49:17.457
(chuckling):
Okay, I see.

49:17.457 --> 49:18.458
Is there anywhere else
you could recommend?

49:18.458 --> 49:20.031
Maybe downtown or...

49:20.031 --> 49:22.132
- Was that a hotel?
- None of your business.

49:22.132 --> 49:25.135
It is absolutely my business.
I'm looking after you.

49:25.135 --> 49:26.994
Looking after me? Really?

49:26.994 --> 49:29.073
- Like what? Like my warden?
- (scoffs)

49:29.073 --> 49:30.635
Like my butler?

49:30.635 --> 49:32.505
There's nobody here, okay?

49:32.505 --> 49:34.408
Just us two losers
and a grieving mom.

49:34.408 --> 49:36.146
So let's cut the shit.

49:36.146 --> 49:38.148
You stay out of my way,
and I'll stay out of yours.

49:38.148 --> 49:40.007
- That's a detention.
- (groans)

49:40.007 --> 49:41.712
You just earned yourself
a detention, sir.

49:41.712 --> 49:43.516
Now, get back here!

49:43.516 --> 49:46.420
Being here with you is already
one big fucking detention!

49:46.420 --> 49:48.983
Son of a bitch,
that's another detention!

49:48.983 --> 49:50.754
("Deck the Halls" by
The Swingle Singers playing)

49:50.754 --> 49:52.030
Mr. Tully!

49:53.957 --> 49:56.331
I don't know what you're
playing at, Mr. Tully,

49:56.331 --> 49:58.828
but you are courting disaster!

49:58.828 --> 50:01.402
Without exercise,
the body devours itself.

50:01.402 --> 50:04.207
You are careening
towards suspension!

50:04.207 --> 50:05.703
(grumbles)

50:09.115 --> 50:11.148
(panting)

50:16.155 --> 50:18.221
(panting heavily)

50:30.994 --> 50:33.236
Don't even think about it,
Mr. Tully.

50:33.236 --> 50:37.372
You are a hair's breadth
from suspension.

50:37.372 --> 50:40.243
I'll wash my hands of you,
you hear me?

50:40.243 --> 50:42.245
Wash my hands.

50:45.107 --> 50:46.810
Stop right there.

50:46.810 --> 50:50.011
You know the gym is
strictly off-limits.

50:51.421 --> 50:53.388
This is your Rubicon.

50:53.388 --> 50:56.688
Do not cross the Rubicon.

51:09.703 --> 51:12.473
(Angus screaming)

51:16.314 --> 51:18.677
Oh, fuck! Ow!

51:18.677 --> 51:21.317
Jesus, Mr. Hunham! Fuck!

51:22.485 --> 51:23.979
Hurry up! Hurry!

51:23.979 --> 51:26.014
I am hurrying!

51:26.014 --> 51:27.752
I was on thin ice already.

51:27.752 --> 51:29.985
If Woodrup finds out,
the facts won't matter.

51:29.985 --> 51:31.987
- He'll make it my fault.
- It is your fault!

51:31.987 --> 51:33.956
You were supposed to be
looking after me.

51:33.956 --> 51:35.595
I told you to stop.

51:35.595 --> 51:37.333
You said you washed
your hands of me.

51:37.333 --> 51:38.796
No, I meant it metaphorically!

51:38.796 --> 51:40.798
Of course you meant it metaphorically.

51:40.798 --> 51:43.834
What were you going to do,
actually go and wash your hands?

51:43.834 --> 51:45.704
This is the end.

51:45.704 --> 51:48.135
They'll inform the school
who will inform your parents,

51:48.135 --> 51:49.675
and then it's curtains.

51:49.675 --> 51:51.446
(chuckles)

51:51.446 --> 51:53.943
You're gonna get me fired.

51:53.943 --> 51:56.319
You. (scoffs)

51:56.319 --> 51:57.980
I'm the one
that might lose an arm,

51:57.980 --> 52:00.323
and all you can think about
is yourself.

52:00.323 --> 52:01.951
NURSE: If you could
fill this out, please.

52:01.951 --> 52:03.689
Admissions and insurance.

52:06.265 --> 52:08.727
(Paul sighs)

52:08.727 --> 52:10.366
Excuse me.

52:12.502 --> 52:16.064
Is there any way we could skip
this whole insurance thing?

52:16.064 --> 52:17.802
It's just standard procedure.

52:17.802 --> 52:19.540
ANGUS:
I understand, but look, um,

52:19.540 --> 52:21.806
we were over at Squantz Pond
playing hockey,

52:21.806 --> 52:23.247
and I slipped on the ice.

52:23.247 --> 52:24.875
Angus, what are you doing?

52:24.875 --> 52:27.878
My mom told him not to take me,
but I made him.

52:27.878 --> 52:29.385
My folks are divorced.

52:29.385 --> 52:31.145
We don't get to see each other
very often.

52:31.145 --> 52:33.389
She'll be mad as a hornet
if she finds out.

52:33.389 --> 52:34.885
NURSE:
Okay, that's your business,

52:34.885 --> 52:36.590
but we just have
certain protocols.

52:36.590 --> 52:38.328
- Yeah. Protocols.
- Please.

52:38.328 --> 52:40.231
I never get to see my dad.

52:40.231 --> 52:42.728
It was my fault. All mine.

52:42.728 --> 52:45.269
I don't want to get him
in any trouble.

52:45.269 --> 52:48.063
I don't want her dragging you
into court again.

52:48.063 --> 52:50.340
We can skip the insurance thing.

52:50.340 --> 52:52.705
We can pay cash.

52:52.705 --> 52:55.004
Right, Dad?

52:55.004 --> 52:57.347
DOCTOR: So the good news is
nothing's broken,

52:57.347 --> 53:00.009
but you did dislocate
your shoulder pretty badly.

53:00.009 --> 53:01.879
What does that mean?

53:01.879 --> 53:04.849
Well, that means that your arm
has popped out of the socket.

53:04.849 --> 53:07.456
And we just need
to pop it back in.

53:09.053 --> 53:11.229
I'm going to have you lie down.

53:12.760 --> 53:14.727
- Nice and easy.
- Is this going to hurt?

53:14.727 --> 53:16.960
- (groaning)
- Any more than it does now?

53:16.960 --> 53:19.028
Not if you relax.

53:19.028 --> 53:22.636
The key is just to relax
as best as you can.

53:23.639 --> 53:25.100
(Angus continues groaning)

53:25.100 --> 53:27.938
DOCTOR:
Deep breaths. Deep breaths.

53:27.938 --> 53:30.006
(rapid, shuddering breaths)

53:31.680 --> 53:33.383
On the count of three.

53:33.383 --> 53:36.584
One, two, three.

53:36.584 --> 53:38.454
(yelling in pain)

53:41.756 --> 53:43.558
- (joint pops)
- Jesus!

53:43.558 --> 53:46.022
(Angus screams)

53:48.092 --> 53:49.597
Barton men don't do that.

53:49.597 --> 53:50.928
Do what?

53:50.928 --> 53:52.600
Barton men don't lie.

53:52.600 --> 53:54.734
Yeah, well, I had momentum.

53:54.734 --> 53:56.538
PAUL:
Mm-hmm.

54:00.544 --> 54:02.137

54:02.137 --> 54:04.282
We have this prescription.

54:05.714 --> 54:07.241

54:07.241 --> 54:08.913
Uh, give me a couple minutes.

54:08.913 --> 54:10.717
PAUL:
Thank you.

54:11.951 --> 54:14.083
Look, you said, if Woodrup
finds out, you're screwed,

54:14.083 --> 54:15.458
so now he won't find out.

54:15.458 --> 54:17.185
What happens
if your parents inquire?

54:17.185 --> 54:18.857
(scoffs) Never gonna happen.

54:18.857 --> 54:20.155
Trust me.

54:21.796 --> 54:25.292
Okay, then.
This all remains entre nous.

54:25.292 --> 54:27.294
Got it? You know
what entre nous means?

54:27.294 --> 54:29.373
<i>Oui, monsieur.</i>

54:29.373 --> 54:30.836
Now you owe me.

54:30.836 --> 54:32.706
Owe you?

54:32.706 --> 54:35.005
Oh, do not try to leverage me,
Mr. Tully.

54:35.005 --> 54:37.447
All I'm looking for
is a little thank-you

54:37.447 --> 54:39.680
that I did something nice
for you.

54:40.815 --> 54:42.617

- Mm.

54:54.222 --> 54:56.400
- The champagne of beers.
- Oh.

54:58.569 --> 55:01.163
Okay, you ready to order? Oh!

55:01.163 --> 55:03.132

55:03.132 --> 55:04.408
As I live and breathe.

55:04.408 --> 55:06.333
What-what...
what are you doing here?

55:06.333 --> 55:07.906
(laughing):
Oh. Hi, guys.

55:07.906 --> 55:09.842
Yeah, I always pick up
a little extra work

55:09.842 --> 55:11.415
over Thanksgiving and Christmas.

55:11.415 --> 55:13.307
Ah.

55:13.307 --> 55:16.046
Well, um, this is Mr. Tully.

55:16.046 --> 55:18.048
MISS CRANE:
Oh, sure. I know you.

55:18.048 --> 55:19.423

55:19.423 --> 55:21.018
We met outside
Dr. Woodrup's office.

55:21.018 --> 55:23.053
I was wrongly accused
of blowing up a toilet.

55:23.053 --> 55:25.528

the wrongly part.

Um, he'll have a cheeseburger.

MISS CRANE:
Okay.

55:29.730 --> 55:31.028
And a Miller High Life, please.

55:31.028 --> 55:33.030
PAUL:
Uh, no, you will not.

55:33.030 --> 55:35.065
Where do you stand on
Miller High Life, Miss Crane?

55:35.065 --> 55:38.937
Well, like they say,
it's the champagne of beers.

55:38.937 --> 55:40.840
- And she's a professional.
- PAUL: Okay.

55:40.840 --> 55:43.139
MISS CRANE (laughs):
Okay, one cheeseburger.

55:44.549 --> 55:46.175
- And a Coke.
- MISS CRANE: Okay.

55:46.175 --> 55:47.913
I will have a cheeseburger
as well.

55:47.913 --> 55:49.453
MISS CRANE (chuckles):
Two cheeseburgers.

55:49.453 --> 55:52.885
- And a Jim Beam on the rocks.
- Oh. Okay.

55:52.885 --> 55:54.183

Please.

55:54.183 --> 55:57.021
Okay. You got it, guys.

Thank you.

Hmm.

Ouch. You two have chemistry.

That's the Percodan talking.

I don't know,
seeing her like this,

56:09.572 --> 56:10.936

56:10.936 --> 56:13.576
Listen, you hormonal vulgarian,

56:13.576 --> 56:15.974
that woman deserves
your respect,

56:15.974 --> 56:19.582
not your erotic speculation.

56:19.582 --> 56:21.551
Well, may I at least
go to the bathroom?

56:21.551 --> 56:24.246
- (Paul sighs)
- Sir?

56:24.246 --> 56:25.984
You mean the pay phone?

56:34.126 --> 56:35.290
- Okay.
- Ah.

56:35.290 --> 56:36.797
A Coke...

56:36.797 --> 56:38.326
- and a double Jim.
- Oh.

I charged you for a single.

56:39.800 --> 56:41.065
- Thank you.
- (chuckles)

56:41.065 --> 56:43.133
- Chin-chin.
- Mm-hmm.

56:43.133 --> 56:46.070
So, how'd you get stuck
holding over?

56:46.070 --> 56:47.676

Mr. Endicott's year.

56:47.676 --> 56:49.612
(chuckles) No, I know.

56:49.612 --> 56:51.911
Uh, I'm being punished.

56:51.911 --> 56:53.847
Yeah, Dr. Woodrup is, um...

with a dictator complex?

56:58.115 --> 56:59.787
Oops. Um...

56:59.787 --> 57:02.493
Uh, what I meant to say was, uh,

57:02.493 --> 57:05.089
well, he's a lovely
compassionate educator

57:05.089 --> 57:07.531
- with a really groovy beard.
- (both laugh)

57:07.531 --> 57:10.325
Yeah. You know, I've had
a lot of former students

57:10.325 --> 57:12.096
ascend to positions
of authority.

57:12.096 --> 57:14.604
He's the only one
I've ever had to report to.

57:14.604 --> 57:16.430
- He was your student?
- Oh, yes.

57:16.430 --> 57:18.036
My first year teaching,

57:18.036 --> 57:20.170
and he was an asshole even then.

Paul Hunham! Is that you?

01:31:51.274 --> 01:31:52.944
It's Hugh.

01:31:52.944 --> 01:31:55.540
Hugh Cavanaugh.

01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:58.213
Ah, yes. Of course.

01:31:58.213 --> 01:32:00.017
Wow. Hugh Cavanaugh.

01:32:00.017 --> 01:32:01.590
Wow.

01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:03.691
Oh, how are you, Hugh?

01:32:03.691 --> 01:32:06.859
Oh, God, what's it been,
30 years? Um...

01:32:06.859 --> 01:32:09.257
Um, this-this is, uh...
this is my wife Karen.

01:32:09.257 --> 01:32:12.128
Honey, this is Paul Hunham.

01:32:12.128 --> 01:32:14.031
- We went to Harvard together.
- Hi, Paul.

01:32:14.031 --> 01:32:16.704
Yes, we did. Yes, we did.

01:32:16.704 --> 01:32:18.266
Uh, wow.

01:32:18.266 --> 01:32:19.938
Uh, what have you
been up to, Hugh?

01:32:19.938 --> 01:32:22.039
- Uh, still in the area?
- HUGH: Oh, yes. Yes.

01:32:22.039 --> 01:32:23.909
I-I'm still in Boston. Cambridge.

01:32:23.909 --> 01:32:25.405
- Harvard.
- Well...

01:32:25.405 --> 01:32:26.945
He just got tenure. Statistics.

01:32:26.945 --> 01:32:29.079
- Oh, Karen.
- He won't blow his own horn.

01:32:29.079 --> 01:32:31.147
- I have to blow it for him.
- Okay. Well, uh,

01:32:31.147 --> 01:32:32.720
what about you, Paul?

01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:34.381
Oh, still teaching.
We have that in common.

01:32:34.381 --> 01:32:36.119
Uh, history, ancient history.

01:32:36.119 --> 01:32:37.285
- That's great.
- PAUL: Yes.

01:32:37.285 --> 01:32:38.550
That's great. Where?

01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:41.256
Oh, um, abroad, mostly.

01:32:41.256 --> 01:32:43.896
On fellowships,
privately funded fellowships.

01:32:43.896 --> 01:32:45.733
Universities
and private academies.

01:32:45.733 --> 01:32:47.592
Mostly fellowships, you know.

01:32:47.592 --> 01:32:50.265
I'm currently posted
in, um, Antwerp.

01:32:50.265 --> 01:32:52.806
Uh, just back here
for the holidays.

01:32:52.806 --> 01:32:54.841
Ah. So, uh, is this your son?

01:32:54.841 --> 01:32:57.976
- Well, um...
- I'm his nephew, Leonard.

01:32:57.976 --> 01:32:59.780
KAREN:
Nice to meet you, Leonard.

01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:01.507
And he's writing a book
right now.

01:33:01.507 --> 01:33:03.146
Um, tell him about your book,
Uncle Paul.

01:33:03.146 --> 01:33:04.818
(chuckles):
My book.

01:33:04.818 --> 01:33:06.479
It's not a book, really.

01:33:06.479 --> 01:33:08.085
Uh, more of a monograph.

01:33:08.085 --> 01:33:10.186
- It's nothing special.
- Don't be so modest.

01:33:10.186 --> 01:33:12.760
It's about, uh, cameras, right?
Ancient cameras?

01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:14.454
- Oh.
- PAUL: Yes.

01:33:14.454 --> 01:33:17.160
No, what he means, of course,
is the camera obscura.

01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:19.701
You know, the optical
and astronomical tool

01:33:19.701 --> 01:33:22.528
that dates back to the time
of, um, Anaxagoras.

01:33:22.528 --> 01:33:24.200
Tell him the title, Uncle Paul.

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:25.806
He's not interested, Leonard.

01:33:25.806 --> 01:33:27.973
Sure, I am.

01:33:27.973 --> 01:33:29.843

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:39.281
Okay, well, um...

01:33:39.281 --> 01:33:41.987
Paul, I'm just so glad
you landed on your feet.

01:33:42.990 --> 01:33:44.352
You look swell.

01:33:44.352 --> 01:33:46.255
You too. So swell.

01:33:47.863 --> 01:33:50.160
And, uh, we'll keep an eye out
for your book.

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:51.557
- Won't we, honey?
- Yeah.

01:33:51.557 --> 01:33:53.031
- Merry Christmas, Paul.
- Merry Christmas.

01:33:53.031 --> 01:33:55.099
- Bye, Leonard.
- Merry Christmas.

01:33:57.499 --> 01:33:59.466
What the fuck just happened?

01:33:59.466 --> 01:34:02.568
I thought Barton men don't lie.

01:34:02.568 --> 01:34:04.306
Don't get me wrong,
that was fun,

01:34:04.306 --> 01:34:05.846
but you just lied
through your teeth.

01:34:05.846 --> 01:34:07.672
What I say during
a private conversation

01:34:07.672 --> 01:34:09.476
is none of your
goddamn business.

01:34:09.476 --> 01:34:11.148
You are not to judge me.

01:34:11.148 --> 01:34:12.886
It wasn't
a private conversation.

01:34:12.886 --> 01:34:14.415
- The wife and I were there.
- (groans)

01:34:14.415 --> 01:34:16.021
- And I helped you.
- (Paul laughs)

01:34:16.021 --> 01:34:17.858
Why did he ask
if you landed on your feet?

01:34:17.858 --> 01:34:19.519
What is this, Nuremberg?

01:34:19.519 --> 01:34:21.158
- Jesus.
- You're the hard-ass

01:34:21.158 --> 01:34:22.764
constantly telling everybody
not to lie

01:34:22.764 --> 01:34:25.063
and going on and on
about the honor code.

01:34:26.803 --> 01:34:28.836
There was an incident
when I was at Harvard

01:34:28.836 --> 01:34:31.168
with my roommate.

01:34:31.168 --> 01:34:33.071
And?

01:34:33.071 --> 01:34:35.601
He accused me of copying
from his senior thesis.

01:34:35.601 --> 01:34:36.877
Plagiarizing.

01:34:36.877 --> 01:34:38.274
Ah.

01:34:38.274 --> 01:34:41.948
- Well, did you?
- No, he stole from me.

01:34:41.948 --> 01:34:43.576
But that blue-blooded prick's
family

01:34:43.576 --> 01:34:45.446
had allies on the faculty.

01:34:45.446 --> 01:34:47.580
I mean, their last name is on
a library, for Christ's sake.

01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:50.891
So he accused me in order
to sanitize his treachery

01:34:50.891 --> 01:34:54.092
and, uh, they threw me out.

01:34:54.092 --> 01:34:56.457
Wait, so you got kicked out
of Harvard for cheating?

01:34:56.457 --> 01:34:58.591
No, I got kicked out of Harvard
for hitting him.

01:34:58.591 --> 01:35:00.065
- (Paul chuckles)
- You hit him?

01:35:00.065 --> 01:35:01.297
What, like punched him out?

01:35:01.297 --> 01:35:03.629
No, I hit him with a car. Ah.

01:35:03.629 --> 01:35:06.368
You got kicked out of Harvard
for hitting a guy with a car?

01:35:06.368 --> 01:35:07.875
By accident.

01:35:07.875 --> 01:35:10.141
Pint of Jim Beam, please.

01:35:10.141 --> 01:35:13.243
But he broke three ribs,
which was technically his fault

01:35:13.243 --> 01:35:14.882
because he shouldn't have been
in the road.

01:35:14.882 --> 01:35:16.576
CASHIER:
Two dollars, please.

01:35:16.576 --> 01:35:18.611
- Also, he shat himself.
- (cash register bell dings)

01:35:18.611 --> 01:35:20.415
Which was the greater indignity.

01:35:20.415 --> 01:35:22.153
(laughs)

01:35:23.156 --> 01:35:24.584
Here you go, killer.

01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:27.554
(cash register drawer closes)

01:35:27.554 --> 01:35:29.930
ANGUS: So Mr. Hunham
never even graduated college?

01:35:29.930 --> 01:35:31.624
- PAUL: Mm.
- Holy shit.

01:35:31.624 --> 01:35:33.428
You didn't finish up
somewhere else? Who else knows?

01:35:33.428 --> 01:35:35.331
Well, Dr. Greene knew.

01:35:35.331 --> 01:35:37.839
Only Dr. Greene.

01:35:37.839 --> 01:35:40.765
He always believed in me,
so he gave me a job.

01:35:40.765 --> 01:35:44.406
Adjunct faculty,
zero respect and even less pay.

01:35:44.406 --> 01:35:46.243
So nobody batted an eye,

01:35:46.243 --> 01:35:48.443
and I've been at the school
ever since.

01:35:48.443 --> 01:35:50.280
Are you ashamed
at how things turned out?

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:53.250
Not at all.
I'm proud of my work.

01:35:53.250 --> 01:35:55.450
I love history. I love Barton.

01:35:55.450 --> 01:35:57.089
Barton is my life.

01:35:57.089 --> 01:35:59.091
I don't know what I would do
without Barton.

01:35:59.091 --> 01:36:00.862
Why'd you lie to that guy?

01:36:00.862 --> 01:36:03.194
Because I knew he'd relish
the fact that I'm a washout

01:36:03.194 --> 01:36:05.031
and never left
my own high school,

01:36:05.031 --> 01:36:06.758
and he'd probably repeat
that story

01:36:06.758 --> 01:36:08.529
to everybody we used to know,

01:36:08.529 --> 01:36:11.697
so I figured he's not entitled
to my story.

01:36:11.697 --> 01:36:13.138
I am.

01:36:13.138 --> 01:36:15.041
Yeah. Yeah, fuck that guy.

01:36:15.041 --> 01:36:18.143
Yeah, exactly. Fuck that guy.

01:36:20.673 --> 01:36:23.643
But, now, you'll keep
this quiet, right?

01:36:23.643 --> 01:36:25.480
No one is to know.

01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:28.219
I mean no one, Angus.

Here's something
I bet you didn't know.

01:40:14.214 --> 01:40:19.219
Your uniform, festive as it is,
is historically inaccurate.

01:40:19.219 --> 01:40:22.420
Saint Nicholas of Myra
was actually

01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:25.456
a fourth-century Greek Bishop
from what is now Turkey.

01:40:25.456 --> 01:40:28.954
So, uh, a robe and sandals
would be closer to the mark.

01:40:28.954 --> 01:40:32.100
Yeah, but I guess that would be
impractical given the weather

01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:34.630
and all the silly but lucrative
mythology about Santa

01:40:34.630 --> 01:40:38.205

and chimneys and whatnot.

01:40:38.205 --> 01:40:39.965
(chuckles) What can you do?

01:40:39.965 --> 01:40:41.571
As Democritus said,

01:40:41.571 --> 01:40:46.939
<i>"O kósmos alloíosis,
o víos ypólipsis."</i>

01:40:46.939 --> 01:40:51.009
"World is decay.
Life is perception."

01:40:57.457 --> 01:41:00.051
My son.

01:41:00.051 --> 01:41:03.659
To see you again causes
my heart to soar like a hawk.

01:41:03.659 --> 01:41:08.301
Grandfather,
I brought you this present.

01:41:08.301 --> 01:41:10.732
Is this the hat I used to own?

01:41:10.732 --> 01:41:13.273
- (Paul chuckles)
- Except grown softer...

01:41:13.273 --> 01:41:15.275
You know,
this is not only amusing,

01:41:15.275 --> 01:41:17.442
uh, but for a movie,
it's a fairly accurate depiction

01:41:17.442 --> 01:41:19.103
of life among the Cheyenne.

01:41:19.103 --> 01:41:21.281
- Shh!
- Fuck off.

01:41:21.281 --> 01:41:23.415
(in movie):
I saw you in a dream.

01:41:23.415 --> 01:41:25.010
- I'm gonna go use the bathroom.
- Mm-hmm.

01:41:25.010 --> 01:41:26.649
(in movie):
You were drinking from a spring

01:41:26.649 --> 01:41:29.355
that came from
the long nose of an animal.

01:41:29.355 --> 01:41:33.425
I did not recognize the animal.

01:41:33.425 --> 01:41:37.462
Alongside his nose,
he grew two horns.

01:41:37.462 --> 01:41:39.530
(movie continues playing
indistinctly)

01:41:51.511 --> 01:41:53.841
(in movie):
...and smoked on this matter,

01:41:53.841 --> 01:41:56.448
and my decision is...

01:41:56.448 --> 01:41:58.648
Little Big Man has returned.

Or meet you at the hotel.

Come with you where?

01:42:48.227 --> 01:42:50.205
To see my dad.

Your dad?
