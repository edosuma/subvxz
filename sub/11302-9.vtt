WEBVTT

00:06.459 --> 00:07.918
Where'd you learn to
make coffee like this?

00:08.002 --> 00:09.003
Campin'.

00:09.087 --> 00:10.588
I was a Girl Scout.

00:10.671 --> 00:13.006
- A Girl Scout?
- Yeah.

00:13.091 --> 00:14.175
Still got the uniform?

00:17.095 --> 00:18.763
Yeah, but it's too small and
it smells like cookies.

00:18.847 --> 00:20.348
All right, stop.

00:20.431 --> 00:22.641
I know what I want for Christmas.

00:24.227 --> 00:26.354
Colt, you used my towel again, asshole.

00:26.437 --> 00:28.356
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.

00:28.439 --> 00:30.691
It's just so dark up in the
bathroom with the power out,

00:30.775 --> 00:32.192
I don't know what I'm reaching for.

00:33.527 --> 00:35.321
But, full disclosure...

00:35.404 --> 00:36.950
I may have wiped with the sock

00:36.975 --> 00:38.932
that you left outside by the hamper.

00:39.909 --> 00:41.828
Full disclosure, I've
been wearing your socks.

00:43.496 --> 00:45.498
Should I not bring
clothes over here anymore?

00:46.415 --> 00:47.625
- Come on, let's go to work.
- Yeah.

00:47.708 --> 00:49.543
- Thank you, darling.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:49.627 --> 00:50.879
Hey, you wanna meet up tonight?

00:50.962 --> 00:53.589
I don't know. I'm supposed to
hang out with my sister, Darlene.

00:53.672 --> 00:55.313
She just got through
a really bad breakup.

00:55.341 --> 00:57.468
Bad breakup, huh? She sounds hot.

00:59.095 --> 01:00.138
She is hot.

01:00.221 --> 01:02.556
And she finally got rid of that
deadbeat asshole of a boyfriend.

01:02.640 --> 01:03.808
Oh.

01:03.892 --> 01:04.909
Well, would you say

01:04.934 --> 01:07.127
deadbeat assholes are kind of her type?

01:08.187 --> 01:10.690
Hey, she just got out of a relationship.

01:10.774 --> 01:13.276
Yeah, her ex left her right
after the baby was born.

01:13.359 --> 01:15.069
Might be a good change for
her to go out with a nice guy.

01:15.153 --> 01:16.754
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah, so we're in agreement.

01:16.821 --> 01:18.865
She should not go out with Rooster.

01:18.948 --> 01:21.325
Stop, he is a good guy.

01:21.409 --> 01:22.911
Maybe the four of us could go out.

01:22.994 --> 01:24.954
Rooster don't like blind dates, so...

01:25.038 --> 01:26.539
Oh, uh, hell yeah, I do.

01:27.999 --> 01:29.333
I mean, dating is
like fishing, you know?

01:29.417 --> 01:31.294
You can sit on the water
all day and not catch a bite.

01:31.377 --> 01:32.628
But a blind date?

01:32.711 --> 01:33.758
That's like a guy drives up

01:33.784 --> 01:35.296
in a boat and just throws you a fish.

01:36.465 --> 01:39.135
After that, all you gotta
do is clean it and eat it.

01:40.678 --> 01:42.346
You must really hate your sister.

01:43.347 --> 01:45.183
Stop. It'll be fun.

01:46.142 --> 01:48.937
- Promise. I'll tell Darlene.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:49.020 --> 01:50.271
- Call me later.
- Yeah.

01:50.354 --> 01:53.775
Oh, hey, don't forget to look for
that Girl Scout uniform.

01:54.818 --> 01:57.236
Hey, you hear that, pal? It'll be fun.

01:58.321 --> 01:59.948
Hey. Hey.

02:01.240 --> 02:03.617
Yo, come on. You cannot
go out with Darlene.

02:03.701 --> 02:05.453
- Why not?
- 'Cause I've...

02:06.454 --> 02:08.705
got a good thing going
with Heather, and I'd...

02:09.707 --> 02:11.167
I just... I know how you are with women.

02:11.250 --> 02:12.543
You mean awesome?

02:13.419 --> 02:16.630
Yeah, so awesome that
Cindy Wilson keyed your car?

02:16.714 --> 02:18.591
That was an accident.

02:18.674 --> 02:20.230
Yeah, oh, she accidentally wrote,

02:20.255 --> 02:21.994
"Rooster Bennett's got a tiny penis"?

02:23.762 --> 02:26.349
Technically, she wrote, "Rooster
Bennett's got a tiny pen,"

02:26.432 --> 02:27.892
'cause I caught her.

02:29.310 --> 02:32.521
That's why I bought all those tiny
pens just to not confuse anybody.

02:33.189 --> 02:34.440
What about Tammy?

02:34.523 --> 02:36.567
She was so pissed, she
set your underwear on fire.

02:36.650 --> 02:38.569
So? Big deal.

02:38.652 --> 02:40.446
You were still wearing 'em!

02:42.365 --> 02:44.742
Look, man, that was a
long time ago, all right?

02:44.826 --> 02:46.906
I'm not gonna do anything
to mess up you and Heather.

02:47.661 --> 02:49.663
All right. Just behave.

02:49.747 --> 02:51.582
Yeah, that's my middle name.

02:51.665 --> 02:54.710
Jameson "Rooster" "Behave"
"Big Dick" Bennett.

04:07.866 --> 04:10.369
Man, I'm exhausted.

04:10.453 --> 04:11.996
Yeah, me too.

04:12.080 --> 04:12.982
If somebody told me there was

04:13.007 --> 04:14.189
a million dollars out in that field,

04:14.248 --> 04:15.624
I don't know if I could go pick it up.

04:15.708 --> 04:17.375
Still going to the bar, right?

04:17.459 --> 04:18.461
Oh, hell yeah.

04:20.838 --> 04:24.175
How is it that you two are so
tired at the end of every day,

04:24.258 --> 04:26.110
but you still muster enough energy

04:26.135 --> 04:27.827
to go out drinking every night?

04:27.886 --> 04:30.263
'Cause it ain't work when
you're doing something you love.

04:33.059 --> 04:34.102
That Mom?

04:34.185 --> 04:35.811
Yeah.

04:35.894 --> 04:37.355
Said she wanted to talk.

04:37.438 --> 04:39.857
Oh, well, as fun as that sounds,

04:39.941 --> 04:42.986
I'm gonna make like
Colt and abandon this family.

04:44.070 --> 04:46.364
I resent that.

04:46.447 --> 04:49.200
And just to prove a point, I'll
stay out here with you, Dad.

04:51.202 --> 04:52.870
Hey, Ma.

04:52.954 --> 04:55.706
Colt, could we have a minute?

04:55.789 --> 04:57.416
I gave it a shot.

05:02.838 --> 05:05.924
Maggie, I know I said I
could talk, but...

05:06.009 --> 05:07.801
I've been up since 4:00 this morning.

05:09.678 --> 05:11.472
How about we do this another day?

05:11.555 --> 05:13.849
Unless you've got some really good news.

05:13.932 --> 05:16.435
I made us an
appointment to go to counseling.

05:16.519 --> 05:17.853
That wasn't it.

05:19.730 --> 05:21.649
I know you don't wanna
talk about your feelings.

05:21.732 --> 05:24.110
When the guy at the gas
station says, "How you doing?"

05:24.193 --> 05:26.154
you tell him to stop prying.

05:27.196 --> 05:29.198
If I wanted him to know, he'd know.

05:30.449 --> 05:32.035
Okay, well...

05:33.119 --> 05:35.246
I don't wanna get divorced.

05:39.042 --> 05:42.461
Well, I hate talking to
strangers and I hate spending money.

05:42.545 --> 05:44.422
Now you're asking me to do both?

05:44.505 --> 05:46.882
No. We won't have to pay...

05:46.965 --> 05:48.801
and it won't be a total stranger.

05:48.884 --> 05:52.096
Priscilla, in my book
club, she's a licensed therapist.

05:53.056 --> 05:54.723
She helped out Noreen and Will.

05:54.807 --> 05:58.852
Will left Noreen for
Stan at the feed store.

06:00.479 --> 06:03.441
And she helped Will to
realize his true feelings.

06:03.524 --> 06:06.277
I could've told Will that 20 years ago.

06:07.903 --> 06:09.363
I really do think it will help us.

06:09.447 --> 06:11.157
She's an expert on marriage.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.284
And what makes her an expert?

06:13.367 --> 06:15.343
The fact that your book club read

06:15.368 --> 06:16.936
Bridges of Madison County?

06:19.123 --> 06:21.084
This is my busiest time of the year.

06:21.167 --> 06:22.418
I know you're busy.

06:22.501 --> 06:24.503
But there'll always be
a reason to put it off.

06:24.587 --> 06:27.715
All right, we agree. Let's never do it.

06:29.049 --> 06:30.801
You want me to move back in, right?

06:32.178 --> 06:33.262
'Course I do.

06:33.346 --> 06:35.179
Well, the only way that's gonna happen

06:35.203 --> 06:36.706
is if we start connecting more.

06:37.641 --> 06:40.811
I really do think it would
help us to see Priscilla.

06:40.894 --> 06:43.188
And afterwards, I'll treat
you to a burger if you want.

06:43.272 --> 06:46.109
If I'm sharing feelings,
I'm eating steak.

06:47.360 --> 06:49.445
Well, let's see how
the first session goes.

06:49.528 --> 06:51.489
Wait a minute. There's more than one?

07:00.498 --> 07:02.458
So, Darlene, how do you
scratch out a living?

07:02.541 --> 07:04.793
Well, four days a
week, Mom watches the kids

07:04.877 --> 07:06.670
and I work down at the nursing home.

07:06.754 --> 07:07.803
Mostly, my job consists

07:07.828 --> 07:09.697
of dealing with cranky senior citizens.

07:09.757 --> 07:11.592
Mmm-hmm. Hey, mine too.

07:12.885 --> 07:14.262
You guys are ranchers, right?

07:14.345 --> 07:16.013
Yeah, Colt works on my ranch.

07:17.556 --> 07:18.766
You like being a rancher?

07:19.433 --> 07:21.018
Did Jesus like being a carpenter?

07:22.395 --> 07:23.729
What?

07:24.230 --> 07:25.403
No, I'm just saying, you know,

07:25.428 --> 07:26.756
I didn't choose it, it chose me.

07:27.733 --> 07:29.735
I mean, ranching game's tough, you know?

07:29.818 --> 07:31.987
You gotta be strong, muscular,

07:32.070 --> 07:36.117
but also sensitive, gentle, you
know, with a real caring touch.

07:37.326 --> 07:39.537
Are you fucking kidding me?

07:39.620 --> 07:43.374
Well, I may have used some
bold imagery, but I...

07:43.457 --> 07:45.031
My ex just posted a picture

07:45.055 --> 07:47.444
with him and his skanky new girlfriend.

07:47.503 --> 07:49.304
Is that the trashiest
bikini you've ever seen?

07:49.338 --> 07:52.133
Oh, come on, you are
so much hotter than her.

07:52.216 --> 07:54.177
Yeah. Well, they're...
Those are...

07:54.260 --> 07:55.928
That... Those are too big.

07:57.846 --> 07:59.932
I should, uh, probably weigh in on this.

08:01.225 --> 08:02.476
What an ass!

08:02.560 --> 08:04.520
Yeah. What an ass.

08:06.104 --> 08:08.357
Listen, Darlene, forget about him.

08:08.441 --> 08:10.193
We're all having a good time here.

08:11.319 --> 08:13.529
You're right. I'm sorry.

08:13.612 --> 08:16.114
Oh, that's all right. You
know, he's the loser, 'cause...

08:16.199 --> 08:18.784
my date's way prettier than his.

08:18.867 --> 08:21.227
I'm guessing, 'cause I didn't
really get to see the picture.

08:23.121 --> 08:24.372
Are you shitting me?

08:24.457 --> 08:26.083
Is that the Eiffel Tower?

08:26.167 --> 08:28.252
Whoa! He took her to Vegas?

08:29.587 --> 08:32.130
This asshole, the father
of one of my children,

08:32.215 --> 08:34.342
is getting married to this dick garage.

08:35.342 --> 08:37.428
All right,
man, I like this chick.

08:39.054 --> 08:40.306
I'm never getting married.

08:40.389 --> 08:42.419
I'm gonna be one of
those pathetic losers

08:42.445 --> 08:43.750
who lives at home forever.

08:43.808 --> 08:46.187
- Oh, you know, that's just like family...
- There's no shame in that.

08:46.270 --> 08:48.564
- Togetherness is really a move...
- Eff my effing L!

08:49.690 --> 08:51.024
Darlene...

08:54.653 --> 08:56.029
Well, she seems stable.

08:57.573 --> 08:58.866
Yeah, no kidding.

08:59.950 --> 09:02.035
Hey, how's that chick, huh?

09:02.953 --> 09:04.663
She got them tig ol' bitties?

09:05.664 --> 09:07.750
I'm gonna get another round.

09:10.294 --> 09:11.629
Two.

09:11.712 --> 09:13.797
Oh, shit. Hey, Abby.

09:13.881 --> 09:16.842
Hey, Colt. What is all that
yelling coming from your table?

09:16.925 --> 09:20.095
Oh, yeah, Rooster's on a blind date.

09:20.178 --> 09:21.222
Got it.

09:23.557 --> 09:25.559
Uh, where's, uh, Kenny?

09:25.643 --> 09:27.128
On Fridays, she waits here

09:27.153 --> 09:29.379
for him to get off from the Marriott.

09:29.438 --> 09:31.440
And then, they usually go see a movie.

09:34.402 --> 09:36.654
Sorry for me taking an
interest in my friends.

09:39.615 --> 09:41.242
I see you're still with Heather.

09:42.034 --> 09:44.995
So, when you guys go out, does
she order off the kids' menu?

09:46.121 --> 09:48.040
No, as long as they have crayons

09:48.123 --> 09:50.334
so she can draw on the
place mat, she's happy.

09:51.627 --> 09:52.875
What do you do, you just sit around

09:52.899 --> 09:54.111
all day and think these things up?

09:54.171 --> 09:56.674
Yeah, in detention I
run 'em by the kids.

09:57.966 --> 09:59.968
You know, 'cause
they're the same age as Heather.

10:01.429 --> 10:04.432
That one's
mine. I just came up with that.

10:04.515 --> 10:05.683
I'll give you that one.

10:05.766 --> 10:07.017
Hey, uh, I got your text.

10:07.100 --> 10:09.895
Your... your truck's
still making that... noise?

10:09.978 --> 10:12.022
Yeah. I replaced the
fan belt like you said

10:12.105 --> 10:13.857
but, uh, it's still doing it.

10:15.233 --> 10:18.279
Is it like a high
pitch... Like a...

10:18.362 --> 10:20.739
No, it's more like a...

10:23.158 --> 10:24.618
You drivin' a truck or a bear?

10:25.536 --> 10:27.955
Hey, you know what? Bring it by
the house. I'll take a look at it.

10:28.038 --> 10:30.291
- Thanks, I will.
- Yeah.

10:30.999 --> 10:32.418
Don't you have to get back to your date?

10:32.501 --> 10:33.794
He wants to...

10:33.877 --> 10:37.130
but Rooster's date's all
broken up about her ex.

10:39.091 --> 10:40.593
Oh, Hank, you gotta...

10:41.427 --> 10:43.596
Actually, he's right.

10:43.679 --> 10:44.930
Hey. I'll see ya, Ab.

10:45.013 --> 10:46.223
See you.

10:47.433 --> 10:48.517
Hey.

10:48.601 --> 10:50.060
Where's Darlene?

10:50.143 --> 10:53.606
She's really upset. I
think I gotta take her home.

10:53.689 --> 10:54.815
Damn.

10:54.898 --> 10:56.359
That's all right. I'll get her home.

10:56.442 --> 10:58.569
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I don't mind.

10:58.652 --> 11:00.195
You guys have fun.

11:00.278 --> 11:01.530
Thank you.

11:01.614 --> 11:02.571
Um, and once you get her home,

11:02.595 --> 11:03.806
Mom can take care of the rest of it.

11:03.866 --> 11:05.576
- Mmm-hmm.
- I'll get her.

11:08.036 --> 11:09.121
Hey.

11:10.038 --> 11:11.039
Remember what we talked about.

11:11.123 --> 11:13.083
I don't want anything messing
things up with me and Heather.

11:13.166 --> 11:16.253
Relax, man, I will be
a complete gentleman.

11:17.045 --> 11:20.383
Hey, can I borrow a couple
quarters for the condom machine?

11:21.133 --> 11:22.134
Dude!

11:22.217 --> 11:24.512
I'm kidding... I already got some.

11:26.179 --> 11:27.180
Dude!

11:27.264 --> 11:30.100
I'm joking, man. Shit, you
know I don't use condoms.

11:36.982 --> 11:38.066
Hi, Priscilla.

11:38.150 --> 11:39.943
Hi, Maggie. Hello, Beau.

11:40.027 --> 11:42.029
Glad you two decided to come.

11:42.112 --> 11:43.822
I'm not laying on a couch.

11:43.906 --> 11:46.617
Well, I don't even have a couch in here.

11:47.493 --> 11:49.703
What kind of a
therapist doesn't have a couch?

11:53.248 --> 11:56.293
Now, I should start by saying
that, though this is my home,

11:56.376 --> 11:59.004
please consider it a
completely professional place.

11:59.087 --> 12:01.110
Uh, however, I do ask that if you need

12:01.135 --> 12:02.949
to use the restroom, please knock,

12:03.008 --> 12:06.804
as my teenage son, Justin, recently
discovered his body.

12:08.722 --> 12:10.015
Okay, so...

12:10.098 --> 12:12.810
let's talk about your marriage.

12:14.227 --> 12:17.189
I'm not even sure what we
have can be called a marriage.

12:17.898 --> 12:19.399
Real helpful, Beau.

12:19.483 --> 12:21.109
Actually, it's very helpful.

12:21.193 --> 12:22.945
Very good, Beau.

12:23.028 --> 12:25.155
He believes that you
two are not in a marriage.

12:25.238 --> 12:28.992
Now, I encourage you both
to say how you're feeling.

12:29.076 --> 12:31.244
I'm feeling like going home.

12:32.746 --> 12:35.833
Beau, you agreed to come
here. At least give it a chance.

12:35.916 --> 12:37.751
You say you're open to
things, but you're not.

12:37.835 --> 12:39.628
You either shut down or complain.

12:39.712 --> 12:42.840
Good. Wonderful. This is so great.

12:42.923 --> 12:45.468
- Are you gonna keep doing that?
- Doing what?

12:45.551 --> 12:47.470
Saying "good" every time we say

12:47.495 --> 12:49.537
something bad about each other?

12:51.223 --> 12:52.390
Let's try this.

12:52.475 --> 12:54.059
Maggie...

12:54.142 --> 12:56.156
when would you say things started

12:56.182 --> 12:58.254
to go away between the two of you?

12:58.772 --> 12:59.940
Well...

13:00.023 --> 13:01.702
I know that once I bought the bar,

13:01.727 --> 13:02.925
he started to resent me.

13:02.985 --> 13:04.487
Are you serious?

13:05.529 --> 13:07.280
Is that really why we came here?

13:07.364 --> 13:10.784
To rehash stuff that we've
been fighting about for years?

13:10.868 --> 13:12.661
Oh, we don't fight, Beau.

13:12.745 --> 13:14.456
I bring something up, you shut me down,

13:14.481 --> 13:16.105
and that's the end of the discussion.

13:16.164 --> 13:18.291
That's not true.

13:18.375 --> 13:19.752
End of discussion.

13:23.255 --> 13:24.840
Okay, fine.

13:24.923 --> 13:27.843
You wanna talk about
something new? Brenda Sanders.

13:27.926 --> 13:29.344
Oh, here we go.

13:31.597 --> 13:33.140
You gotta be kidding.

13:33.223 --> 13:34.850
You're going to bring up Brenda here?

13:34.933 --> 13:36.644
I told you, I didn't sleep with her.

13:36.727 --> 13:39.021
Well, I had to walk around with
the whole town thinking you did.

13:39.104 --> 13:41.690
- No one thought that.
- Oh, we all did.

13:42.566 --> 13:44.902
You know what? I'm done.

13:46.111 --> 13:48.280
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

13:55.078 --> 13:57.414
Well, that was a good session.

13:57.497 --> 13:59.875
Priscilla, shut the fuck up.

14:03.211 --> 14:04.337
Mornin'.

14:05.005 --> 14:06.089
Hey, Rooster.

14:06.173 --> 14:07.633
Thanks for taking
care of things last night.

14:07.716 --> 14:10.218
Oh, I took care of things
last night, all right.

14:12.470 --> 14:15.223
Wait, after all of that, you
still hooked up with her sister?

14:15.307 --> 14:17.032
No, I did not. I did not, in fact,

14:17.058 --> 14:18.585
hook up with Heather's sister.

14:19.728 --> 14:20.813
Mom?

14:23.106 --> 14:24.316
No!

14:25.651 --> 14:26.777
What are you doing here?

14:26.860 --> 14:29.613
Uh... I'm sorry, sweetie.

14:29.697 --> 14:31.699
I didn't plan for this to happen.

14:32.783 --> 14:34.910
Colt, this is Mary, Heather's mom.

14:34.993 --> 14:36.119
Heather, Mary, uh...

14:36.203 --> 14:37.746
No introduction needed.

14:39.372 --> 14:41.291
Uh, nice to... meet you.

14:42.459 --> 14:45.963
I'm really surprised this
happened, given our conversation.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.132
Yeah, I thought you took Darlene home.

14:49.216 --> 14:50.300
Uh, yes, I did.

14:50.383 --> 14:53.596
And taking her home on my
motorcycle was a bit of a mixed blessing.

14:53.679 --> 14:55.088
The sound of the bike, you know,

14:55.113 --> 14:56.873
kind of drowned out most of her tears.

14:57.975 --> 15:00.060
But then I pulled up to this
light and had to explain to a cop

15:00.143 --> 15:02.563
that I was not, in fact,
kidnapping her. So...

15:04.648 --> 15:07.109
Yeah, he got Darlene
home safe and sound.

15:07.192 --> 15:10.112
He was so sweet. He even
sang her baby a lullaby.

15:10.195 --> 15:13.156
Yeah, Ozzy
Osbourne, "Crazy Train."

15:14.491 --> 15:16.660
Whoo-hoo. All aboard.

15:18.203 --> 15:20.581
And then we started talking.

15:20.664 --> 15:23.834
Turns out, Mary has always
had the hots for the Rooster.

15:23.917 --> 15:25.753
Oh, God... That is not what I said.

15:25.836 --> 15:29.632
What I said was, "The Bennett
men are all very handsome."

15:29.715 --> 15:31.759
- It's true.
- I bowl with your father.

15:32.635 --> 15:34.845
Oh, great. Now my dad's hot.

15:37.305 --> 15:38.682
He really is.

15:40.768 --> 15:42.477
How would you like it if
I said your mom's hot?

15:42.560 --> 15:44.062
Hey, back off.

15:46.649 --> 15:47.858
We talked for hours.

15:47.941 --> 15:49.484
You know, once you
get past "the Rooster,"

15:49.567 --> 15:53.947
Jameson is a really
sweet, smart, sensitive guy.

15:54.031 --> 15:56.574
You can't prove that.

15:57.993 --> 16:00.495
So I offered
him some wine, and...

16:00.578 --> 16:02.956
we started talking about
our lives in Garrison,

16:03.040 --> 16:04.801
and then one thing led
to another and then...

16:04.875 --> 16:06.009
Yeah, we didn't want, you know,

16:06.033 --> 16:07.568
Darlene to wake up and see us, 'cause...

16:07.628 --> 16:10.297
that would be awkward.

16:13.591 --> 16:14.677
Yeah.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.469
That would be awkward.

16:17.763 --> 16:19.556
Well, it's a little hot in here.

16:21.934 --> 16:23.601
Hmm.

16:23.686 --> 16:25.979
Yeah, he gets hot flashes. He's
going through the change.

16:27.355 --> 16:28.523
You know what, honey, um,

16:28.606 --> 16:29.568
why don't you grab your coat

16:29.593 --> 16:30.966
and I'll drop you at home before work?

16:31.026 --> 16:32.027
Okay.

16:32.110 --> 16:33.904
- Hey, where do you work?
- Cracker Barrel.

16:33.987 --> 16:35.238
Oh, shit. Jackpot.

16:37.741 --> 16:38.951
Get us a discount?

16:39.034 --> 16:40.703
You know I can.

16:40.786 --> 16:43.496
I know this is a little
fast, but I think I love you.

16:45.833 --> 16:48.085
- I'll talk to you later.
- Bye, Rooster.

16:48.168 --> 16:49.929
All right, Roth
girls, y'all have a good day.

16:52.297 --> 16:53.590
Ooh.

16:55.050 --> 16:56.093
Hey...

16:57.177 --> 16:58.470
what did you do?

16:58.553 --> 16:59.826
Colt... it would be unsavory

16:59.851 --> 17:01.622
to give you the details of the things

17:01.682 --> 17:03.684
I did to your girlfriend's
mom last night.

17:07.020 --> 17:10.065
You cannot date Heather's mom!

17:10.147 --> 17:12.943
Are you intentionally
trying to fuck up my life?

17:13.026 --> 17:14.987
You don't need my
help to fuck up your life.

17:15.988 --> 17:17.865
Who does that?

17:17.948 --> 17:20.068
I mean, I was cool with
you going out with her sister,

17:20.117 --> 17:21.868
but you don't bang the mom, dude.

17:21.952 --> 17:24.621
Hey, I like the mom, dude.

17:25.413 --> 17:27.332
No, you don't. That's bullshit.

17:27.415 --> 17:29.042
You like any woman
standing in front of you.

17:29.126 --> 17:30.961
You liked her
daughter earlier in the night.

17:31.044 --> 17:33.505
Yeah, that's 'cause her daughter's hot.

17:33.588 --> 17:36.008
But Mary's hot and cool, you know.

17:36.091 --> 17:38.844
Like a sandwich with buffalo
sauce and ranch dressing.

17:40.470 --> 17:43.140
It's my girlfriend's mom!

17:43.223 --> 17:44.201
You know,

17:44.226 --> 17:46.375
you just don't care about
anybody, do you?

17:46.434 --> 17:48.040
Look, man, I'm closer in age to her

17:48.065 --> 17:49.670
than you are to Heather, all right?

17:49.730 --> 17:51.243
You think about it, you're the weirdo

17:51.267 --> 17:52.381
who's dating a 23-year-old.

17:54.442 --> 17:57.195
No, you think about
it, you're an asshole.

17:58.196 --> 17:59.315
That is no way to speak

17:59.340 --> 18:00.847
to your future father-in-law.

18:07.873 --> 18:10.208
Your calves look healthy to me, Beau.

18:10.292 --> 18:13.586
A good thing, too, because
I know if they didn't,

18:13.670 --> 18:15.756
you wouldn't have the
money for me to fix 'em.

18:15.839 --> 18:17.424
You know, I'd insult you back,

18:17.507 --> 18:19.508
but I know you wouldn't
hear it 'cause you're deaf.

18:19.551 --> 18:22.012
- What?
- I said, "Thanks for coming over."

18:23.305 --> 18:24.765
Can I get you some coffee?

18:24.848 --> 18:27.309
Coffee? No...

18:27.392 --> 18:30.145
Whiskey'd be good,
though. That Jim Beam looks fine.

18:30.228 --> 18:33.106
Are you kidding? It's
10:30 in the morning.

18:33.190 --> 18:35.984
I don't know. Phyllis Diller, I guess.

18:48.371 --> 18:49.790
Some weather comin' in.

18:49.873 --> 18:51.749
You feelin' it in your knee?

18:51.834 --> 18:53.626
I see the clouds.

18:53.710 --> 18:55.378
You blind, too?

18:56.213 --> 18:58.491
No, but I wish I
was, then I wouldn't have

18:58.516 --> 19:00.157
to look at your sour old puss.

19:01.176 --> 19:02.970
- Here you go.
- Cheers.

19:04.221 --> 19:06.556
I got somethin' I wanna ask you, Dale.

19:06.639 --> 19:09.267
About as long as you're
pourin', I'm listenin'.

19:10.685 --> 19:13.271
How have you and Charlene stayed
together for so long?

19:13.355 --> 19:15.773
Well, part of it's love...

19:15.858 --> 19:17.567
part of it's hard work.

19:18.276 --> 19:19.830
Big part of it is when she starts

19:19.855 --> 19:21.637
telling me about how her day is goin',

19:21.696 --> 19:24.199
I... I turn my bad ear toward her...

19:24.282 --> 19:29.371
and every once in a while say, "Yep.
Uh-huh. Sure sounds tough."

19:30.497 --> 19:33.917
Well... Maggie and I
are havin' a hard time.

19:34.877 --> 19:37.545
I don't even know what the
right thing to do is anymore.

19:37.629 --> 19:40.590
Yep. Uh-huh. Sure sounds tough.

19:42.759 --> 19:44.094
Damn it, Dale.

19:44.970 --> 19:46.554
You know...

19:46.638 --> 19:49.182
back in the ranch, I had two old horses.

19:49.266 --> 19:51.434
Both over 20 years old.

19:51.518 --> 19:54.229
One of 'em was a mare, one
of 'em was a gelding.

19:54.312 --> 19:56.106
And they were almost inseparable.

19:56.189 --> 19:57.565
I remember those two.

19:57.649 --> 20:00.152
- What?
- I said, "I remember those two."

20:00.235 --> 20:03.571
Well, who cares if you do?
I'm telling the story here.

20:05.532 --> 20:09.036
Well, the mare kept
biting at the gelding's tail.

20:09.119 --> 20:12.747
And the gelding kept stealing
carrots meant for her.

20:12.830 --> 20:15.583
Then one day, she up and died.

20:15.667 --> 20:17.377
Just old age.

20:18.170 --> 20:21.548
Ten days later... the
gelding followed her.

20:22.674 --> 20:24.885
Are you saying that horse
died of a broken heart?

20:24.968 --> 20:27.845
Oh, hell no. It's the worst
case of colic I ever saw.

20:27.930 --> 20:30.098
Probably from all 'em carrots he stole.

20:31.183 --> 20:33.018
I had to put him down.

20:33.101 --> 20:36.438
So, if Maggie dies, I
should avoid eating carrots?

20:37.397 --> 20:38.899
Look, all I'm saying is...

20:40.108 --> 20:42.069
if we care for something...

20:42.152 --> 20:43.728
we sometimes have to put up

20:43.753 --> 20:45.387
with things that annoy us.

20:46.281 --> 20:47.615
Like you and me.

20:48.366 --> 20:50.827
You know, I don't like you one bit.

20:51.536 --> 20:53.538
Well, I don't care for you much, either.

20:54.539 --> 20:56.791
And if you need to talk, let me know.

20:56.874 --> 20:59.252
I'll charge you by the hour.

20:59.336 --> 21:01.254
Yep. Uh-huh.

21:01.338 --> 21:02.923
Sure sounds tough.

21:09.887 --> 21:11.681
Oh, hey, Colt.

21:11.764 --> 21:13.850
Hey, Mrs. Roth.

21:13.934 --> 21:15.865
Oh, come on, you can call me Mary.

21:15.889 --> 21:17.378
I am fucking your brother.

21:17.437 --> 21:20.190
Yeah, your daughter and I are...

21:22.442 --> 21:23.901
I can't say it.

21:26.113 --> 21:28.240
Look, I know today was weird.

21:28.323 --> 21:31.576
Yeah.
It's still kind of weird.

21:31.659 --> 21:32.910
Yeah.

21:32.995 --> 21:34.212
When I was coming down those stairs

21:34.237 --> 21:35.521
with my panties tucked into my purse,

21:35.580 --> 21:38.916
I just thought, "Mary...
this is not your finest hour."

21:39.876 --> 21:40.961
On the other hand...

21:41.044 --> 21:42.587
how often do you get
to do the walk of shame

21:42.670 --> 21:44.511
in front of your
daughter... and her boyfriend?

21:44.589 --> 21:48.426
Huh? I mean, come on, that's
one for the highlight reel.

21:49.761 --> 21:52.514
If you're tryin' to make this
less weird, it ain't working.

21:54.266 --> 21:56.393
I know. You know, if I could
do last night over again,

21:56.476 --> 21:57.727
I would do it differently.

21:57.810 --> 22:00.522
You know? I would talk to Heather.

22:00.605 --> 22:03.086
I would talk to you. I would
make sure y'all were okay with it.

22:03.150 --> 22:06.069
But... honey, that's
not how it happened...

22:06.153 --> 22:07.904
and here we are.

22:09.406 --> 22:11.824
All right, look, if you
want to date a Bennett,

22:11.908 --> 22:14.327
I got a cousin who's a doctor...

22:14.411 --> 22:15.953
I mean, it's true, he's a dent doctor.

22:16.038 --> 22:17.664
He pulls out dents in cars, but...

22:18.581 --> 22:20.250
I mean, still, it's better than Rooster.

22:21.543 --> 22:23.045
Honey, look...

22:23.128 --> 22:25.672
I had my first kid when I was 17.

22:25.755 --> 22:27.697
I mean, it's only recently

22:27.722 --> 22:29.408
I've gotten to live my own life.

22:30.677 --> 22:32.554
I didn't really get to have my 20s.

22:33.763 --> 22:35.307
So that's why you're dating Rooster,

22:35.390 --> 22:36.950
you want to do something you'll regret?

22:38.518 --> 22:40.187
You know what? That's funny.

22:40.270 --> 22:41.646
That's exactly what I told Heather

22:41.729 --> 22:43.490
when she told me she
was dating Colt Bennett.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.402
All right. I get it.

22:48.320 --> 22:51.030
Look, I'm... I'm sure moving forward...

22:51.989 --> 22:54.284
things will get better.

22:54.367 --> 22:56.786
'Sup, amigo?

22:59.372 --> 23:01.166
Yeah, it ain't gettin' better.

23:01.249 --> 23:03.543
Hey, Heather, your
little boyfriend's here.

23:07.547 --> 23:09.091
You two don't stay out too late now.

23:09.174 --> 23:11.634
Come on, babe, Shark
Tank is about to start.

23:16.973 --> 23:18.057
You got a minute?

23:19.517 --> 23:20.768
You know what?

23:20.852 --> 23:23.563
I'm done. Sound familiar?

23:24.397 --> 23:25.565
It does.

23:29.902 --> 23:31.446
Maggie, you annoy me.

23:33.865 --> 23:35.074
Aw, thank you.

23:35.158 --> 23:36.618
Other men bring flowers.

23:38.911 --> 23:40.788
And I know that I annoy you.

23:41.998 --> 23:43.895
But if this is gonna work, we're both

23:43.921 --> 23:45.817
gonna have to put up with some stuff.

23:46.419 --> 23:47.420
All right.

23:48.463 --> 23:50.215
I'm sorry about walking out...

23:51.007 --> 23:53.260
when you brought up Brenda.

23:53.343 --> 23:54.761
What do you want me to say?

23:55.595 --> 23:56.638
I was lost.

23:58.055 --> 23:59.724
You'd just moved out.

23:59.807 --> 24:02.477
I needed to get a haircut. She cut hair.

24:05.021 --> 24:06.689
I was upset over you.

24:07.649 --> 24:09.359
Her husband had just passed.

24:09.442 --> 24:10.818
We talked.

24:11.944 --> 24:13.070
That's it.

24:13.946 --> 24:15.657
I know all that.

24:15.740 --> 24:17.825
I brought up Brenda to prove a point.

24:17.909 --> 24:21.246
When things get
uncomfortable, you shut down.

24:21.329 --> 24:24.123
And I'm afraid if I move
back into that house...

24:24.207 --> 24:26.584
we're gonna go back to the
way we were before I left.

24:28.795 --> 24:30.588
I'm not saying things
are gonna be perfect.

24:30.672 --> 24:33.090
Oh, that was clear when
you told me I annoy you.

24:35.760 --> 24:38.638
I'm a different person
than I was 15 years ago.

24:38.721 --> 24:41.641
And I don't wanna go back
to the way it was, either.

24:41.724 --> 24:44.227
Oh... glad to hear that.

24:47.021 --> 24:48.606
I don't wanna lose you, Mags.

24:50.358 --> 24:52.652
You know, in your whole
life, you only get...

24:52.735 --> 24:55.655
one person who knows you best.

24:56.864 --> 24:58.325
And that's you.

24:58.408 --> 25:00.910
Damn it, Beau.

25:01.869 --> 25:04.205
When did you learn to
say all the right things?

25:05.873 --> 25:07.875
I saw The Bridges of Madison County.

25:14.716 --> 25:16.133
I think your mom is awesome.

25:16.218 --> 25:18.887
It's just that Rooster's... not.

25:18.970 --> 25:22.390
I don't want what's going
on with them to screw us up.

25:23.099 --> 25:24.934
Fine, say they do break up.

25:25.017 --> 25:26.686
Yeah, let's pray they break up.

25:26.769 --> 25:29.314
No, who cares?

25:29.397 --> 25:31.816
They got their thing and we got ours.

25:32.567 --> 25:33.610
I like you.

25:34.402 --> 25:37.822
Nothing's changin'
that, no matter what they do.

25:37.905 --> 25:39.907
Give me a second.

25:39.991 --> 25:42.577
Dear Lord, break 'em up.

25:42.660 --> 25:44.537
Go, Broncos. Amen.

25:45.830 --> 25:48.666
Look, if you're okay
with this, I won't worry.

25:48.750 --> 25:50.668
I might still kick my brother's ass...

25:50.752 --> 25:52.545
but we'll be fine.

25:53.380 --> 25:55.715
- High school phenom, Colt Bennett.
- Oh, yeah.

25:55.798 --> 25:56.883
Your table's ready.

25:58.426 --> 26:00.094
Did you seriously put that as your name?

26:00.177 --> 26:02.221
You want a free
appetizer or not?

26:03.515 --> 26:05.308
Yeah, well, we're already
getting my mom's discount.

26:05.392 --> 26:08.811
Yeah, well, I'm pretty
sure free is cheaper than 40%...

26:08.895 --> 26:10.730
but I'm no mathmagician.

26:11.689 --> 26:13.107
Hey, isn't that Kenny and Abby?

26:13.190 --> 26:15.192
Oh, yeah, it is.

26:15.277 --> 26:16.319
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

26:16.403 --> 26:18.154
Hey, Colt. Hi, Heather.

26:19.113 --> 26:21.198
Uh, oh, Kenny, your, uh,
napkin fell on your lap.

26:23.951 --> 26:25.712
- So, how are you guys doing?
- Good.

26:25.745 --> 26:27.497
Just celebrating our anniversary.

26:27.580 --> 26:29.499
We had our first date
here five years ago.

26:29.582 --> 26:31.584
Yeah, anyway, nice to see you two.

26:31.668 --> 26:32.917
I'm sure you wanna get going

26:32.942 --> 26:34.903
and enjoy a nice
dinner at your own table.

26:34.962 --> 26:36.548
Easy, Ken Dog.

26:36.631 --> 26:38.425
I'm pretty sure this barrel's
big enough for the both of us.

26:39.676 --> 26:41.761
No, I'm sorry. I just meant
that it would be better if...

26:41.844 --> 26:43.805
Oh, look at that. You
got the chocolate...

26:43.888 --> 26:45.139
Fuck me.

26:48.476 --> 26:51.354
Kenny, is that... Are you...

26:51.438 --> 26:52.855
Sweetie...

26:52.939 --> 26:55.567
Uh, this isn't how I
planned it, but, uh...

26:58.277 --> 27:02.699
Ah... you are
smart, you're beautiful...

27:02.782 --> 27:04.951
you're oddly competitive.

27:06.411 --> 27:07.442
You could have picked

27:07.467 --> 27:09.480
anybody in the world, and you chose me.

27:12.417 --> 27:14.920
I love you more than
anything in the world.

27:15.002 --> 27:16.629
Abby Phillips...

27:18.340 --> 27:21.217
will you marry me?

27:21.300 --> 27:23.803
Yes. Of course.

27:29.058 --> 27:30.518
Oh, my God. Congratulations.

27:30.602 --> 27:32.854
Yeah.

27:33.289 --> 27:34.563
Congrats.
