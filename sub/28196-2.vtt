00:00.584 --> 00:01.950
Hi Leah. How are you?

00:02.001 --> 00:03.789
Thank you for agreeing to meet.

00:03.836 --> 00:06.204
I'm just wondering
if you've had some help with this?

00:06.298 --> 00:07.298
So you mean did I cheat?

00:07.466 --> 00:09.753
You're asking that question
over and over again.

00:09.801 --> 00:11.588
What's that?
- Am I good enough?

00:11.762 --> 00:13.594
You stand by what you said?
- Of course.

00:13.639 --> 00:15.346
Cos this isn't your essay at all.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.590
Leah's always had something against me

00:18.185 --> 00:19.301
and I don't know why.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.998
I might not be able to give you a baby.
Does that even bother you?

00:22.022 --> 00:23.022
Cos it bothers me.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.983
- Can I rely on you?
- What'd you mean?

00:27.277 --> 00:28.734
Can you get me Leah Dale's address?

00:29.279 --> 00:30.815
She's such an inspiring lecturer.

00:30.906 --> 00:32.424
She must have picked up so much from you.

00:32.448 --> 00:33.940
Last night our cat died.

00:34.618 --> 00:35.618
Poor Betsy.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.699
You are still not convinced

00:38.747 --> 00:40.659
that we got the right one.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.289
They both look so innocent.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074

00:54.888 --> 00:56.688
You really need to work out
who's on your side

00:56.807 --> 00:58.127
who's lying to you and who isn't.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.850
How can you be so naive, Leah?

01:02.854 --> 01:04.813
How can you sit there with that look
on your face?

01:05.440 --> 01:07.080
As if you've got no idea what's going on.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.032
Why are you lying?

01:16.702 --> 01:17.702
Exactly why would I?

01:56.366 --> 01:57.366
Hi Rose.

01:58.285 --> 01:59.742
Hiya, you alright?
- Yeah.

02:04.499 --> 02:07.162
Can I help or...?
- No I'm... waiting for a mate.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.330
Alright. See you around.

02:13.550 --> 02:14.550
Adam.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.093
Actually...

02:16.261 --> 02:18.021
don't suppose you've got
a couple of minutes?

02:18.055 --> 02:19.055
Yeah, come on up.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.882
No. She doesn't hate you.

02:22.934 --> 02:26.177
She's just got a bit
of a bee in her bonnet at the moment.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.308
I just feel like I'm constantly under attack.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.810
One minute she's apologising,
the next she's so cold.

02:31.193 --> 02:33.185
Well, Leah's got a lot
on her plate at the moment.

02:33.403 --> 02:34.735
Yeah, she told me about your cat.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.238
Mmm.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.898
It's almost like she was accusing me.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.572
Let me speak to her.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.480
I'm sure we can clear this up.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.031
- This at The York?
- Mm-hm.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.007
Didn't have you down
as a fancy dress kinda guy.

02:51.463 --> 02:52.544
Ah. Absolutely.

02:53.465 --> 02:56.503
You're actually unlucky to catch me
on one of the few days when I'm...

02:57.219 --> 02:58.585
wearing normal clothes.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.174
Would you talk to her for me?

03:01.431 --> 03:02.967
Yes, yes, I will.

03:03.767 --> 03:04.883
Maybe we could all go out?

03:05.477 --> 03:07.093
Just chat it through the three of us?

03:08.271 --> 03:11.810
Well, I think I should probably
just speak to her first.

03:12.275 --> 03:16.565
It's just really hard to revise
and having this review hanging over me

03:16.613 --> 03:19.276
I, I understand. I'll talk to her. I promise.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.801
You're not what I thought you'd be like.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.369
Uh...

03:26.623 --> 03:27.863
What did you think I'd be like?

03:27.999 --> 03:30.412
Boring as fuck, like the rest of them.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.973
OK, everyone.
That's more than enough time.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.020
Let's have your thoughts.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.877
There see. Rose lives here in college.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.336
Room twelve.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.516
Uh, do you want me
to take that along to her?

05:00.300 --> 05:03.061
No, it's alright I've got something I need
to discuss with her anyway.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.177
I wish my Paul was romantic like that.

05:07.974 --> 05:11.012
Oh yeah. Well what can I say?
I'm a lucky girl.

05:22.113 --> 05:23.113
Sorry.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.496
Oh, go ahead.

05:36.294 --> 05:37.535
Thanks.
- Rose?

05:38.755 --> 05:39.755
Rose?

07:00.879 --> 07:02.745
Oh shit.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.179
Rose?

07:55.767 --> 07:57.127
Leah, what were you thinking?

07:57.811 --> 07:58.931
Well I didn't plan it did I.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.415
I just went to talk to her
and the cleaner was coming out so I just...

08:01.439 --> 08:03.897
And if you got caught breaking
into a student's room?

08:03.984 --> 08:05.252
I mean, what do you think would happen?

08:05.276 --> 08:07.563
Oh... stop it.
I was in there for two minutes. Less!

08:08.113 --> 08:10.480
Why?
What on earth were you doing in there?

08:11.783 --> 08:12.783
I just...

08:15.996 --> 08:17.532
I thought I might find Betsy's collar.

08:18.415 --> 08:19.415
I know, I know.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.287
It's just it's these little things
that she does.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.046
Like knowing Betsy's name

08:29.009 --> 08:31.843
and sure she could have seen it
on the basket but...

08:32.178 --> 08:35.011
who goes around to people's houses
and notices things like that?

08:36.474 --> 08:37.806
It's literally right there.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.139
I'm not having a go at you.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.438
Do you accept this a massive leap
you're making?

08:46.484 --> 08:48.646
Yes of course.
- And if you're fired?

08:49.946 --> 08:52.654
How lucky are we to work
in the same city? Same university?

08:53.366 --> 08:54.982
Yeah, well that's not gonna happen so...

08:58.121 --> 09:00.141
Look, if there's anything you're unsure
about anything at all

09:00.165 --> 09:01.445
now would be the time to say it.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.373
Why are you making this about us?

09:06.421 --> 09:08.333
Well, have you even read the leaflets?

09:09.007 --> 09:12.045
No, I haven't yet but I will...
- But you're taking your tablets again?

09:14.095 --> 09:16.678
It's like you've stopped trying
without even talking to me.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.123
Do you know how that makes me feel?

09:19.976 --> 09:22.889
OK, I am sorry darling.
I should have talked to you before but I...

09:23.146 --> 09:24.432
You don't need to apologise.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.189
I'm just concerned that this whole...

09:28.359 --> 09:31.818
Rose situation is your way of avoiding
what's going on between you and me

09:31.905 --> 09:33.549
and that scares me a little bit,
that's all.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.573
Right.

10:46.938 --> 10:47.938
Hello, hello.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.355
Someone's been in my room.

10:49.691 --> 10:50.727
What broken in?

10:51.067 --> 10:51.942
Yeah. I think so.

10:51.944 --> 10:53.263
Right, you need to tell security.

10:53.862 --> 10:56.070
Can't you just get me the CCTV
from the corridor?

10:56.156 --> 10:59.570
You're supposed to report the incident
and they'll investigate it properly.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.178
So you don't have access to the footage?

11:01.202 --> 11:03.082
Well I do but I'd lose my job
if they caught me.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.223
Ben, someone's been in my room.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.287
Do you not understand how scared
that makes me feel?

11:08.293 --> 11:09.625
You said you'd always help me.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.046
Yeah, sorry.

11:14.966 --> 11:15.966
I'll look into it.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.134
Promise?

11:18.428 --> 11:20.044
Yeah. I promise.

11:21.556 --> 11:22.556
Thanks, Ben.

11:30.565 --> 11:32.022
Oh, you sneak!

11:34.360 --> 11:36.943
So? Is there any truth in it?

11:37.238 --> 11:38.238
In what?

11:38.448 --> 11:42.112
Do you think that maybe,
on some level you are...

11:43.411 --> 11:45.152
avoiding issues with Adam by...

11:46.289 --> 11:49.407
The only thing that Adam's wanted
to talk about for two years

11:49.709 --> 11:50.916
is getting pregnant.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.373
Cos it's a logistical problem
that he can solve.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.417
Whenever I want to talk about
anything else like...

11:57.217 --> 11:59.069
what we're actually gonna do
with this baby when it gets here

11:59.093 --> 12:00.129
oh he just...

12:00.803 --> 12:04.046
He shuts that conversation down
cos he knows that the less we talk about it

12:04.140 --> 12:06.473
the more likely we are
to fall back to the default position

12:06.559 --> 12:07.845
of me doing everything.

12:10.939 --> 12:11.939
Yeah.

12:17.111 --> 12:20.354
I think we've been trying
for a baby for so long

12:20.865 --> 12:22.697
I've got used to the idea of not having one.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.038
And that's alright.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.329
Come here.
- No it...

12:40.718 --> 12:42.175
How much do you love me, Rose?

12:43.388 --> 12:44.388
Why?

12:44.764 --> 12:46.972
How much do you love me?

12:48.977 --> 12:49.977
Did you get her?

12:50.228 --> 12:51.228
Nailed her.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.521
So you, you do love me then?

12:59.904 --> 13:02.317
Course I do!
You know I do, don't you?

13:29.600 --> 13:30.600
Amy?

13:32.812 --> 13:33.812
Leah.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.648
Aim's.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Leah...

14:52.059 --> 14:54.141
Ooh! You alright?

14:54.268 --> 14:55.509
Yeah I'm fine, I'm fine.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.553
Hurry up! You still coming for lunch?

14:58.064 --> 15:01.603
Erm no. I can't. I've just got,
I've got too much work on.

15:02.110 --> 15:05.274
Well, we've all got work to do, mate,
it's called procrastination.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.408
Leah?

15:11.744 --> 15:12.744
Leah?

15:17.834 --> 15:19.951
I can't find my engagement ring.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.498
Were you definitely wearing it?

15:23.005 --> 15:24.005
Yes.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.291
I put it with my necklace on my purse.

15:27.510 --> 15:28.630
Have you had a look in here?

15:30.471 --> 15:32.929
Can you just... Yes just check.

16:02.253 --> 16:03.253
You're not hungry?

16:03.629 --> 16:04.949
I wish you wouldn't order for me.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.755
I wish you'd turn up on time.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.133
For once in your life.

16:13.181 --> 16:14.181
How's Aunty Pam?

16:18.561 --> 16:19.768
She didn't fancy joining us?

16:25.526 --> 16:27.206
You're a spiteful little girl, aren't you?

16:34.410 --> 16:35.526
She's in a lot of pain.

16:38.915 --> 16:39.915
But...

16:40.833 --> 16:42.324
she's battling.
- Aw.

16:43.294 --> 16:44.294
Send her my love, yeah?

16:48.591 --> 16:51.379
This erm. This essay business.

16:53.471 --> 16:57.431
I imagine that's just you attempting
to embarrass me. Is that it?

16:59.310 --> 17:00.950
No. You've not even asked me
if I cheated.

17:01.562 --> 17:04.349
Well don't come bleating to me
when they chuck you out.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.935
This time you're on your own, OK?

17:08.653 --> 17:09.653
What?

17:10.820 --> 17:11.820
No, come on.

17:12.573 --> 17:14.690
Nothing.
- Come on. What's so bloody funny?

17:16.410 --> 17:17.617
When was I not on my own, Dad?

17:20.830 --> 17:24.040
The emphasis is on World
Literature, need I remind you.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.999
Please ensure that the references
in your dissertation reflect that.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.089
Simply quoting Plato and Nietzsche
will not suffice.

17:32.593 --> 17:36.052
Try using something outside
the recommended reading list.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.008
Surprise me.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.469
Thank you, people.

17:40.726 --> 17:41.726
Good luck.

17:50.278 --> 17:52.478
I thought we were meeting
at the party? What's up?

17:53.781 --> 17:55.113
I've lost my engagement ring.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.945
What? How on earth did you managed that?

17:58.160 --> 17:59.160
Don't get cross.

18:00.663 --> 18:01.995
I think Rose took it.

18:04.375 --> 18:05.491
OK, ask Amy.

18:05.543 --> 18:08.206
We were in the changing rooms
after tennis and it disappeared.

18:09.880 --> 18:14.250
What, so one moment it was there
and the next it was gone?

18:14.510 --> 18:17.218
Well no, not exactly.
But I definitely had it before the game.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.346
A hundred percent?

18:18.681 --> 18:21.799
Yes! And she's mentioned it a few times.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.351
What?

18:23.978 --> 18:24.894
The ring.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.356
Have you any idea how much
that thing cost me?

18:30.401 --> 18:32.142
Yes I...
- How many times have I told you

18:32.194 --> 18:33.651
not to take it off?

18:33.779 --> 18:36.362
And I don't take it off.
- You do, you do.

18:36.532 --> 18:37.989
Wha...
- When you're in the shower.

18:38.409 --> 18:39.489
When you do the washing up.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.827
Flick it around on your desk
while you're working.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.372
I don't do that.

18:44.374 --> 18:46.093
You, you don't even realise
you're doing it.

18:46.709 --> 18:47.709
I'm telling you.

18:47.752 --> 18:49.163
I know that Rose took it.

18:49.503 --> 18:50.584
How do you know?

18:54.550 --> 18:56.416
Because this was in my pocket, right?

18:57.637 --> 19:01.176
This look.
How would that get in there?

19:01.515 --> 19:02.993
It fell in there when you were carrying it.

19:03.017 --> 19:03.975
I don't know.
- Come on!

19:03.977 --> 19:07.765
Look you, you take that ring off
four or five times a day.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.632
I, I've always said you were
gonna lose it and now you have.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.562
Right then.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.352
Don't, no don't do that.

19:19.575 --> 19:24.115
Even if Rose is trying to wind you up,
and I, I don't doubt that she is

19:24.163 --> 19:26.246
a little bit,
but why are you letting her do it?

19:27.958 --> 19:30.746
Just think about what you're accusing her of.
She's just a kid.

19:31.128 --> 19:35.042
She, s-stares at her phone gets drunk
at The York like the rest of them.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.589
The York? Did she say that?

19:41.305 --> 19:43.922
Well, she saw the Halloween photo
on my desk.

19:45.601 --> 19:46.601
Why?

19:46.894 --> 19:50.808
Because The York closed over three years
ago, before she'd even started here.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.563
It's not a crime to go to the pub, Leah.

19:54.860 --> 19:58.103
OK, this is the photo on your desk yes?

19:58.155 --> 19:59.155
Yeah.

19:59.740 --> 20:00.740
No look!

20:01.701 --> 20:04.284
Right, that could be any pub anywhere
in the world.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.069
So how does she know
that that's The York?

20:09.542 --> 20:10.542
Hmm.

20:12.420 --> 20:13.420
Hang on!

20:15.172 --> 20:16.959
Is that? Look!

20:32.982 --> 20:36.100
That is pretty creepy to be fair.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.421
- Thank you!
- Oh don't...

20:37.445 --> 20:39.027
not you as well. She's obsessed!

20:39.238 --> 20:40.196
You know what she did?

20:40.197 --> 20:41.197
Oh Adam.

20:41.198 --> 20:43.281
No, do you know, did she tell you?

20:43.576 --> 20:46.159
She broke into Rose Vaughan's room.

20:46.203 --> 20:49.071
I didn't break in.
The cleaner was coming out!

20:49.540 --> 20:50.540
It's ridiculous.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.449
Yeah well, I mean...
- Excuse me.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.994
Look at that, I mean come on.

20:56.130 --> 20:59.544
Come on...
- Alright I'll admit, doesn't look to good

20:59.592 --> 21:00.628
Oh, thank you.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.636
But... OK, but if you're right
if that's the case.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.712
That means she'd have to be stalking us
for over two years.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.223
How do you explain that?
- Well I can't explain it.

21:08.267 --> 21:12.102
but the facts are that picture was taken
before she was a student here

21:12.146 --> 21:13.762
and she's looking right at us.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.555
Look!
- In our direction.

21:15.649 --> 21:16.649
No at...
- Hiya.

21:21.655 --> 21:22.736
What are you doing here?

21:22.948 --> 21:25.108
Oh, I've been doing silver service
since I started uni.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.609
Dad thought it would be character building.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.764
Oh yeah, he lives round here, doesn't he?

21:28.788 --> 21:30.404
Yeah. About forty minutes away.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.477
So, you must have known the place
pretty well before you came here?

21:33.501 --> 21:34.662
Yeah, I guess so why?

21:35.461 --> 21:36.542
Oh, no reason.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.417
Could I get a top up, please?
- Yeah of course, sorry.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.041
I love your dress!

21:43.844 --> 21:44.844
Thanks very much.

21:45.262 --> 21:47.424
- Anyone else?
- Oh I'm fine. Thanks.

21:47.473 --> 21:48.348
Have a lovely evening!

21:48.350 --> 21:49.590
Thank you.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.394
Ah... she's awful.

21:55.773 --> 21:56.773
Don't be a dick.

21:57.650 --> 21:58.936
I'm not being a dick.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.414
I'd say it's ready to take to publishers.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.685
I think you'll have a lot of interest.

22:15.501 --> 22:16.781
You think people will go for it?

22:16.919 --> 22:17.919
You know I do.

22:20.548 --> 22:22.228
Can't believe this guy hasn't read it yet.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.080
Have a word with yourself, Adam.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.349
Adam?

22:33.018 --> 22:34.018
Sorry?

22:34.270 --> 22:35.670
You still haven't read Leah's book?

22:36.355 --> 22:38.017
Oh err, I'm gonna read it

22:38.107 --> 22:40.770
just as soon as I've finished watching
this series of "Bake Off".

22:40.985 --> 22:42.185
I thought I'd made that clear.

22:43.571 --> 22:45.938
Of course I'm gonna read it.
Looking forward to it.

22:47.741 --> 22:48.857
A long time coming.

22:49.410 --> 22:50.410
She's worked very hard.

22:50.619 --> 22:51.700
Anyone for more wine?

22:51.871 --> 22:53.703
Erm yeah, I'd love some, thank you.

22:54.498 --> 22:55.579
Man after my own heart.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.249
Is that guy bothering you?

22:59.086 --> 23:01.078
Ben? No he's, just a friend.

23:01.422 --> 23:03.209
Are you sure?
- Yeah. Thank you.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.021
You sure you don't want
any more wine, Leah?

23:07.094 --> 23:08.551
No I'm fine. Thank you.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.170
OK, I'll just leave it there then.

23:14.143 --> 23:15.143
Did you see that?

23:15.436 --> 23:16.436
See what?

23:16.645 --> 23:18.511
Did you... did you see that?
- No.

23:19.481 --> 23:20.722
She's wearing my fucking ring.

23:21.358 --> 23:22.358
Where are you going?

23:23.611 --> 23:24.611
Leah!

23:26.155 --> 23:27.155
Rose!

23:30.159 --> 23:31.159
Rose!

23:32.328 --> 23:33.328
Give it to me.

23:33.579 --> 23:35.320
What?
- My ring. Give it to me.

23:35.706 --> 23:36.742
This?
- Yep.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.477
This is my ring?
- So I've never seen you wear a ring before

23:39.501 --> 23:41.993
and then suddenly the same day
that I lose mine

23:42.296 --> 23:44.649
you turn up wearing exactly the same ring?
Is that what you're saying.

23:44.673 --> 23:45.775
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

23:45.799 --> 23:46.799
Show us!

23:47.176 --> 23:48.176
It does look similar.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.924
This is my mum's ring, OK?

23:52.598 --> 23:55.398
I wear it every year on her birthday
and I'm sorry if that offends you.

23:55.559 --> 23:57.391
OK.
Maybe we should go back inside?

23:57.436 --> 23:58.972
Yeah. I'm sorry we'll...

23:59.146 --> 24:01.666
Rose, sorry, maybe if you could just show us
the ring really quickly?

24:01.690 --> 24:03.397
Would that be alright?
- No. Why should I?

24:03.776 --> 24:05.856
There's an engraving on that ring
from you, remember?

24:06.070 --> 24:08.390
Of course, I remember.
- Right, so that will prove it then.

24:10.324 --> 24:13.067
Rose if you don't mind.
It might just help to clear things up?

24:13.369 --> 24:14.576
I'm going inside.

24:18.415 --> 24:19.290
Give me that!

24:19.291 --> 24:20.873
Argh! Leah, what the f...

24:20.918 --> 24:21.918
- Leah!
- Argh!

24:21.961 --> 24:23.327
There, there!

24:23.379 --> 24:25.416
- Oh my God...
- There, look.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.007
You OK?

24:28.133 --> 24:29.133
Let me see.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.422
I knew it. I knew she'd taken it. Look I...

24:32.638 --> 24:33.719
It's very similar.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.056
No, look it's mine

24:35.058 --> 24:36.923
it's, Adam put this engraving on it.

24:41.939 --> 24:43.271
How did you do that?
- Oh...

24:43.649 --> 24:45.060
That's impossible. That's...

24:46.151 --> 24:47.831
I'm so sorry.
- Get her home. Get her home.

24:48.362 --> 24:50.682
It's really, really similar.
- Rose, are you OK? I'm sorry.

24:51.824 --> 24:52.824
I'm so sorry.

24:53.534 --> 24:54.534
Are you alright?

24:59.248 --> 25:00.328
What the hell got into you?

25:09.591 --> 25:11.048
Come on. Let's get you to bed.

25:11.093 --> 25:13.836
I think I can make it
up the stairs myself. Thank you.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.183
What?

25:21.311 --> 25:22.311
I'm going to bed.

25:26.358 --> 25:29.772
She set me up Adam! She's clever!
Can you not see it?

25:29.820 --> 25:32.403
No, I can't! And nor can anybody else.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.106
You're not stupid, Leah!

25:34.408 --> 25:36.365
Can't you see
you're projecting all your anxiety

25:36.410 --> 25:38.618
and stress onto this ridiculous argument.

25:39.913 --> 25:41.950
And I, I, I know we're not good
at the moment.

25:41.999 --> 25:45.288
I know I'm not perfect but at least
I'm trying to confront things head on.

25:45.502 --> 25:46.538
Like an adult.

25:50.090 --> 25:51.376
She scares me, Adam.

25:51.425 --> 25:53.041
Just, ask yourself why?

25:53.510 --> 25:55.718
Why would she do any
of the things that you're saying?

25:56.180 --> 25:57.860
Well, that's what I'm gonna find out.
- No!

25:58.098 --> 25:59.098
You're not!

25:59.224 --> 26:01.056
Because there's nothing to find out!

26:02.061 --> 26:05.520
For once it would be really nice
if you believed me about something.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.601
Just once.
- Yes, just for once I'd appreciate it

26:07.691 --> 26:10.308
if you gave half a shit
about anyone other than yourself!

26:18.160 --> 26:19.241
She didn't steal the ring.

26:20.245 --> 26:21.326
She didn't kill the cat.

26:22.539 --> 26:23.539
Grow the fuck up.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.121
Sandra, hello.

27:51.962 --> 27:53.703
Err it's Adam Dale.

27:56.049 --> 27:58.041
Yeah. I was
wondering, could you give me a...

27:58.552 --> 28:01.966
contact email for a student, please?

28:04.266 --> 28:05.141
Yep.

28:05.143 --> 28:08.180
Freud believed that the mistakes
we make say something about us

28:08.854 --> 28:09.970
about our subconscious.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.979
They're never completely unintentional.

28:13.734 --> 28:14.734
OK?

28:17.154 --> 28:19.737
So when Leah lost the engagement ring
that you bought her.

28:20.741 --> 28:21.741
he would say that

28:23.118 --> 28:25.235
on some level, she did it on purpose.

28:26.955 --> 28:28.742
How is the finger? It's not broken is it?

28:29.416 --> 28:31.453
No, it... it's just a sprain.

28:32.753 --> 28:33.753
It's not that bad.

28:35.881 --> 28:36.881
Argh.

28:37.549 --> 28:41.668
I just want to apologise
on behalf of Leah.

28:41.762 --> 28:47.349
I erm I, I really don't know
what's got in to her.

28:47.517 --> 28:49.597
I'm sure I'm not completely blameless
in all of this.

28:52.272 --> 28:55.856
Well, I think we both know
she's taken things way too far.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.443
And I'm going to have
to have a chat with Stephan

28:58.487 --> 28:59.839
but if any of this should get back to her...

28:59.863 --> 29:01.863
Oh, you don't think
I'm gonna say anything, do you?

29:05.661 --> 29:07.118
You'd be well within your rights.

29:09.539 --> 29:10.620
I would never do that.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.033
Leah is a brilliant teacher.

29:17.130 --> 29:18.962
But I am serious
about us three meeting up.

29:23.220 --> 29:26.180
Well, I'm sure that can be arranged.
I'll have a chat with student liaison.

29:27.307 --> 29:30.846
OK I, I thought something
a bit more like this.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.252
Something social might clear the air.

29:36.650 --> 29:38.607
They do an open mic night
at The Crooked Billet.

29:39.987 --> 29:40.987
It's on tonight.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.443
You could just ask her.

29:46.285 --> 29:49.619
Yeah, I don't think that's gonna happen.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.409
Oh go on, it'll be fun.

29:54.293 --> 29:58.253
I feel on edge all the time. Erm...

30:02.217 --> 30:04.459
Angry. Yesterday I was so angry.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.216
I'm not usually like this.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.682
You mentioned you were back on medication.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.060
Is that helping?

30:13.937 --> 30:15.053
No. Well...

30:16.982 --> 30:18.518
It's helping me to sleep but...

30:19.651 --> 30:22.394
I, I don't know.
I've only just started taking it so...

30:26.033 --> 30:28.992
Have you thought about couple's counselling?

30:31.163 --> 30:32.495
Adam would never do it.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.872
But would you like to do it?

30:41.465 --> 30:44.173
This morning I stood by
and watched him sleeping.

30:44.593 --> 30:46.334
Well, that's quite sweet.

30:47.554 --> 30:50.888
I was wondering what it would be like
to pour hot coffee all over him.

30:52.559 --> 30:53.559
But you didn't.

30:54.353 --> 30:55.353
No.

30:57.439 --> 30:59.772
His alarm went off
before I had the chance.

31:09.159 --> 31:10.900
I guess what I'm asking you is...

31:13.163 --> 31:15.997
if a person that you love keeps
telling you that you're...

31:16.750 --> 31:17.750
neurotic

31:18.835 --> 31:19.835
paranoid.

31:22.297 --> 31:24.289
At what point do you start to believe them?

31:46.488 --> 31:47.673
<i>Hi this is Leah Dale.</i>

31:47.697 --> 31:50.280
I <i>can't get to the phone right now so,
you know what to do.</i>

31:50.992 --> 31:53.075
Err, it's me. Again.

31:55.414 --> 31:56.414
Wondering where you are.

31:57.582 --> 31:58.582
If you're OK.

31:59.418 --> 32:00.618
If you're coming home tonight?

32:03.380 --> 32:04.962
I know you're pissed off, but just...

32:21.273 --> 32:22.273
Fuck it.

32:50.135 --> 32:52.215
Thought it was only alcoholics
who sat alone in pubs?

32:52.637 --> 32:54.048
The best people are alcoholics.

32:55.307 --> 32:56.764
Tried reading this without a drink?

33:03.398 --> 33:04.980
Good point. What you having?

33:05.984 --> 33:06.984
A pint if your buying.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.360
This time.

33:16.953 --> 33:18.239
If I were you

33:18.788 --> 33:22.498
I would move this whole
paragraph up here

33:24.336 --> 33:25.668
Which one?
- This last one.

33:25.712 --> 33:26.712
Move it up there.

33:27.214 --> 33:29.501
You know it's beautifully written
and it nicely sets up

33:29.549 --> 33:31.586
most of what you want to say
in the second section.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.260
Yeah...

33:34.262 --> 33:36.629
Yes, that works.
Thank you for this Dad.

33:39.893 --> 33:41.350
I'm very proud of you, you know?

33:47.651 --> 33:51.110
Hey, pass me that blue book.
I'm sure it'll help.

33:51.154 --> 33:52.770
On the end.
- This one?

33:53.281 --> 33:54.281
Yeah.

33:55.825 --> 33:56.825
Thank you.

33:57.661 --> 34:00.244
Oh, where's that... that photo gone?

34:00.497 --> 34:01.497
Which one?

34:01.623 --> 34:03.785
That one of me and you at my graduation?

34:05.126 --> 34:07.368
Bloody thing fell off the wall
and the frame broke.

34:08.588 --> 34:11.295
You know this last section here, erm.

34:11.675 --> 34:13.074
I don't think you need this at all.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.148
Go on then.
So what would be your song?

34:18.431 --> 34:19.512
What me, up there?

34:20.891 --> 34:24.010
I'm... not really a karaoke kind of guy.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.480
It's not karaoke. It's open mic.

34:28.525 --> 34:29.565
And what's the difference?

34:31.777 --> 34:33.360
Two bottles of wine.

34:34.322 --> 34:35.601
I wish you'd have heard it.

34:38.743 --> 34:43.158
Oh I'm, I'm sorry what did I,
did I miss the next Joni Mitchell?

34:45.833 --> 34:46.870
What?

34:48.628 --> 34:51.027
The boys I usually date don't even know
who Joni Mitchell is.

34:59.306 --> 35:00.763
She was my mum's favourite too.

35:06.396 --> 35:07.807
What happened? With your mum?

35:08.773 --> 35:11.173
- What you really wanna know?
- You really wanna tell me?

35:12.861 --> 35:14.621
She killed herself when I was six years old.

35:17.907 --> 35:18.907
Jesus.

35:19.409 --> 35:21.196
Got drunk. Drove off a cliff.

35:23.705 --> 35:25.662
Ah God. I'm sorry.

35:30.503 --> 35:32.244
My dad and I
were never really close but...

35:33.256 --> 35:34.963
after that we barely spoke for ten years.

35:38.803 --> 35:41.341
Parents. They just don't get it, do they?

35:42.515 --> 35:43.515
About what?

35:44.225 --> 35:46.888
Every word that comes out their mouths
means so much to a kid

35:47.896 --> 35:48.896
they just don't get it.

35:51.858 --> 35:52.858
Should be an advert.

35:55.445 --> 35:56.811
Don't drink and drive.

35:57.739 --> 35:59.321
Don't say mean shit to your kids.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.705
When I have kids,
I'm just gonna tell them nice things

36:09.292 --> 36:10.874
all day, every day.

36:12.671 --> 36:13.671
That's all I'm gonna do.

36:19.302 --> 36:22.045
I shouldn't have drunk so much.

36:22.639 --> 36:25.097
Oh yeah, it's your um
review tomorrow, isn't it?

36:25.433 --> 36:27.220
Yeah...
- You know I could talk to Leah again

36:27.268 --> 36:30.432
and err, see if she'd maybe call it off.

36:30.814 --> 36:34.148
No it's, it's fine it's...
I'm looking forward to it, now.

36:34.693 --> 36:35.979
Clearing my name and all that.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.610
Here. Err take this, for a taxi.

36:38.655 --> 36:40.772
No, it's fine. I'm just gonna walk.
- No. Come on.

36:41.658 --> 36:44.822
It's not far.
- It, it, it. It's late. Take it.

36:50.792 --> 36:51.792
Thank you.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.169
For what?

36:54.212 --> 36:55.373
For this evening. It was fun.

36:58.174 --> 36:59.174
My pleasure.

37:06.391 --> 37:07.723
Well err...

37:09.728 --> 37:13.688
I mean, d'you wanna erm,
come back to mine, for... for a quick...

37:13.732 --> 37:15.268
y'know for a, for a night cap?

37:15.567 --> 37:16.567
Would Leah mind?

37:17.736 --> 37:19.147
She's at her mum's tonight.

37:20.447 --> 37:22.439
Sounds really nice but,
maybe not the best idea.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.652
Course, of course, not a problem.
I need to...

37:25.201 --> 37:26.863
get some sleep. Taxi!

37:28.997 --> 37:30.637
I... I only meant for a drink, obviously.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.331
It was...
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.209
It's just... early start and...

37:36.379 --> 37:37.379
Alright.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.130
Your carriage awaits.

39:30.785 --> 39:32.545
<i>Kind of regretting not coming over now.</i>

39:34.455 --> 39:35.866
Well, erm.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.115
I've just opened a bottle of wine.

39:38.167 --> 39:40.079
I thought only alcoholics drink alone?

39:40.420 --> 39:41.420
<i>Err that's right.</i>

39:41.422 --> 39:44.414
Which is why erm, you should come over

39:45.425 --> 39:49.294
help me finish it, y'know just
for... for my own health reasons.

39:51.472 --> 39:53.179
I'm stressed about the review tomorrow.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.808
<i>Hey. You'll be fine. You're very smart.</i>

39:56.060 --> 39:57.060
So is Leah.

39:57.937 --> 40:02.307
Look. Why don't you jump in a cab?

40:02.609 --> 40:03.850
Come on over. I'll pay for it.

40:04.360 --> 40:05.360
<i>I want to.</i>

40:06.571 --> 40:07.778
But I should get some sleep.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.567
<i>Yeah. OK.</i>

40:09.616 --> 40:10.616
Sure.

40:11.159 --> 40:12.159
<i>Night, Adam.</i>

43:20.765 --> 43:22.222
She's always late.

43:23.518 --> 43:25.158
We'll give her another five minutes then.

44:10.731 --> 44:11.731
Come in.

44:13.151 --> 44:14.151
Hi.

44:14.777 --> 44:15.938
Hi Rose. Take a seat.

44:19.657 --> 44:20.693
Are we ready to start?

44:21.617 --> 44:23.324
I said are we ready to start?

44:27.373 --> 44:28.659
Leah, are you OK?

44:30.418 --> 44:31.418
Leah!
