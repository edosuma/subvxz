00:03.504 --> 00:06.130
What'd you take?
Dawson, track marks.

00:06.298 --> 00:07.715
Previously on Chicago Fire.

00:07.883 --> 00:10.510
Last few weeks
have seen a spike
in fatal overdoses.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.262
We are now approaching
each overdose as a
potential homicide.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.725
Clarice Carthage
and Leslie Shay?
Yes?

00:17.893 --> 00:18.768
You've been served.

00:18.936 --> 00:21.104
What is it?
Petition for full custody.

00:21.271 --> 00:22.730
You two know each other?

00:22.898 --> 00:24.774
I was engaged
to Eric's sister.

00:24.942 --> 00:27.443
The number you have reached
is no longer in service.

00:27.611 --> 00:29.612
You were a coward then
and you're a coward now.

00:29.780 --> 00:32.573
Before this goes
any further south,
why don't you walk away?

00:32.741 --> 00:35.743
You are to be in this house
from 9:00 p.m. To 9:00 a.m.
Every day.

00:35.911 --> 00:38.121
You are not to associate
with any known criminals.

00:38.288 --> 00:39.247
What are you doing?

00:39.415 --> 00:41.749
I'll be back
before my curfew.
Don't worry about it.

00:41.917 --> 00:42.875
I'm worried,
Mom. You're...

00:43.043 --> 00:45.002
I am not going out
to sell crack!

00:45.170 --> 00:46.379
I've never seen you
like this before.

00:46.547 --> 00:47.755
There's this new crew
out of New York...

00:47.923 --> 00:50.258
Those who don't pay,
their girls are getting hit
with bad dope.

00:50.426 --> 00:52.468
That's who I'm trying
to bring down.

00:54.012 --> 00:57.014
Oh my God! Antonio!
Somebody help!

01:03.939 --> 01:05.940
Try not to move.
You're going
to be all right.

01:06.108 --> 01:07.191
You're going to be fine.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.867
Hey! Hey, stop!

01:23.959 --> 01:25.752
Gunshot wounds
to the abdomen
and left chest,

01:25.919 --> 01:27.295
exit under the
arm caught the
axillary artery.

01:27.463 --> 01:28.379
I'll take over on pressure.

01:28.547 --> 01:30.506
He's my brother.
I'm going into the
O.R. With you.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.508
Can't do it. Now.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.429
Got it.
Somebody grab the monitor.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.473
Let's get him up
the hall into four.
Go, go, go!

01:43.353 --> 01:44.771
He's all cleaned
up, Daddy.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.190
Oh, no. I'm not the...
I'm not the... I'm...

01:49.026 --> 01:50.109
Okay.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.445
Oh. Oh.
Okay.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.908
Hey, guy. Hey, bud.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.369
Daddy.

02:01.997 --> 02:03.706
Hey, bud!

02:21.683 --> 02:24.018
Dawson. What happened?

02:25.229 --> 02:26.813
Oh, baby.
I don't know.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.664
I'm not happy about
our fight last night.

02:45.749 --> 02:48.543
It's important to me
that we communicate.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.004
I agree.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.674
I get the sense
you weren't too happy
about me going out

02:54.842 --> 02:56.634
with my friend
Gary last night.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.763
It had nothing to do with...

03:00.931 --> 03:01.681
Gary.

03:01.849 --> 03:05.476
I was worried
about my mother
violating her parole.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.854
- Fine.
- Agreed.

03:11.859 --> 03:15.111
Can we agree
to trust each other?

03:17.322 --> 03:19.657
To discuss things
like two adults?

03:21.743 --> 03:22.743
Yeah.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.705
I'm happy to hear it.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.790
Eat, while they're still warm.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.423
You know something?

03:36.842 --> 03:37.884
You're right.

03:40.262 --> 03:42.263
If we're going to
live together, we
need to get things

03:42.431 --> 03:43.806
out in the open.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.434
So I'm going to ask.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.271
Why'd you do it?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.570
Now you're just being hurtful.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.823
No, I'm asking
a question I need
the answer to.

04:03.368 --> 04:06.787
In 15 years, you've
never told me why.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.665
What made you
go over to Dad's...

04:09.833 --> 04:11.292
You always do this!

04:24.723 --> 04:25.848
He was really cagey.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.768
We were talking
right before
it happened.

04:28.936 --> 04:32.730
He's... he's...
He's lucky that
you were there.

04:33.815 --> 04:34.941
Okay?

04:38.028 --> 04:40.071
Pete, it's fine.
She knows.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.243
Is he out of I.C.U?

04:47.496 --> 04:48.537
No, not yet.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.498
I'm going to go
to the hospital
after shift.

04:50.666 --> 04:51.958
All right,
I'll go with you.

04:54.753 --> 04:55.795
Hey.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.923
I just heard.
How is he?

04:59.883 --> 05:01.342
Uh, he lost
a lot of blood,

05:01.510 --> 05:03.803
so, they're still
doing the transfusions.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.931
I'm so sorry.

05:07.099 --> 05:08.933
Your brother went so
above and beyond for me

05:09.101 --> 05:10.017
with the Voight thing.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.812
If there's anything
I can do just
let me know.

05:13.981 --> 05:14.814
Thank you.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.649
Uh, Chief wanted
me to tell you

05:16.817 --> 05:18.901
there's a police
detective here to
see you in his office

05:19.069 --> 05:20.444
for some
follow-up questions.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.488
Okay.

05:28.954 --> 05:29.870
Dawson, come on in.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.915
This is Detective
Dan Vikan
from Narcotics.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.625
Very sorry to hear
about Antonio.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.043
We got damn
near every cop
in this city

05:36.211 --> 05:37.712
out looking for
who shot him.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.005
Good to know.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.923
Antonio was
looking for the
leader of the crew

05:41.091 --> 05:42.842
that's been putting
out the bad drugs.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.260
He talk to you about that?

05:44.428 --> 05:45.845
'Cause I know you had
a conversation with him

05:46.013 --> 05:47.013
right before he was shot.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.851
He said that
guys from Narcotics

05:52.019 --> 05:53.394
were being territorial

05:53.562 --> 05:55.855
and didn't want
a guy from Vice
taking his collars,

05:56.023 --> 05:58.649
so he was doing
twice the work.

06:01.737 --> 06:03.779
Let's have an.
Honest conversation.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.448
Let's.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.451
Your brother went way
off the reservation
on this one.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.870
You told me you were
here to investigate
the shooter,

06:11.038 --> 06:12.538
not investigate Antonio.

06:12.706 --> 06:13.873
It's all related, Chief.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.458
And unfortunately,
the first step

06:15.625 --> 06:17.168
is to try and sift
through eight
layers of lies

06:17.335 --> 06:19.962
he sold his superiors
and colleagues.
Myself included.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.881
I'd trust my
brother with my life.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.799
I don't know you
from a load of wood.

06:28.930 --> 06:32.892
Your boss has my card
if you decide to change
your mind and help.

06:40.650 --> 06:44.737
I honestly don't know
anything about what's
going on with Antonio.

06:45.864 --> 06:46.906
Okay.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.211
Morning.
Morning.

07:06.468 --> 07:07.676
You still work on boats?

07:07.844 --> 07:08.928
Yeah.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.640
Boater's key. Thanks.

07:12.808 --> 07:14.767
Mmm, you probably
already got one, right?

07:14.935 --> 07:16.310
Always use another.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.814
I was out of
line last shift.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.609
So, uh, that is
half a peace offering.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.236
Accepted.

07:25.403 --> 07:26.612
The other half?

07:26.780 --> 07:28.197
A bribe.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.741
These things cost
seven bucks, man.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.160
Fair enough. Look,

07:35.664 --> 07:37.373
now that I know
what really happened

07:37.541 --> 07:38.958
between you and Renee,

07:39.793 --> 07:41.627
I'm thinking she's
probably been
letting the guilt

07:41.795 --> 07:42.795
beat her up this
whole time.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.173
I got no right
to ask this, but...

07:47.801 --> 07:49.301
I think if you
reached out to her,

07:49.469 --> 07:51.637
it could go a long
way towards turning
things around.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.515
'Cause like I said, man,
we don't hear from her.

07:55.350 --> 07:58.227
Look, this is
her cell number.

07:58.395 --> 08:01.397
At least I think it is.
It's a computerized voice.

08:01.565 --> 08:02.481
I've left messages.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.942
Eric, I don't
even really know
what I would say.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.280
So maybe it's
just best to leave
the past in the past.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.991
Maybe even just
hearing your voice...

08:12.159 --> 08:13.826
It might make a difference.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.087
Hey, chow's up!

08:27.048 --> 08:29.008
Hey, hey! Don't
you even think about it.

08:30.552 --> 08:33.220
Shay, this is that
baby book I was
telling you about.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.681
Lots of good stuff,
swaddling, soothing...

08:35.849 --> 08:36.807
Thanks, Herrmann.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.976
Hey, do you know
if it says anything
about sleep schedules?

08:39.853 --> 08:41.687
I didn't read it.

08:41.855 --> 08:42.688
Hmm.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.232
All right, you're our
guy for construction
on the new bar, right?

08:46.484 --> 08:49.445
I believe the offer was
"free consultation."

08:49.613 --> 08:51.155
Okay. All right, fine.

08:51.323 --> 08:53.699
The inspection
is tomorrow, and then our
new silent partner

08:53.867 --> 08:56.076
is coming over
here later for
a meet-and-greet.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.204
We just got
to make sure that
this guy knows

08:58.371 --> 08:59.705
that we're driving this car.

08:59.873 --> 09:03.709
Go easy. Extra partner
means lower costs
for the rest of us.

09:03.877 --> 09:04.752
I'm with Herrmann.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.004
There's an old
Japanese proverb...

09:07.172 --> 09:09.882
Don't let your
daughter-in-law eat
your autumn eggplants.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.843
What the hell does that mean?

09:13.011 --> 09:14.720
Don't let yourself
be taken advantage of.

09:17.849 --> 09:18.724
Okay.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.809
Engine 51, Truck 81,
Ambulance 61.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.228
Possible drowning.

09:32.739 --> 09:33.739
Right there.

09:40.580 --> 09:44.083
We were playing,
and all of a sudden
Patrick fell in!

09:44.251 --> 09:45.584
Please, help my son!

09:45.752 --> 09:47.753
How long has
he been under?
Three minutes,
maybe more.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.172
Let's get that
straight-frame to the
edge of the lake right now.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.548
Exactly where did he fall in?

09:51.716 --> 09:53.592
Right here.
He came up
for a second,

09:53.760 --> 09:55.261
then he went right
back down again.

10:00.475 --> 10:01.767
Keep feeding me line
until I hit bottom,

10:01.935 --> 10:04.270
then allow six more feet
every time I tug twice,
all right?

10:04.437 --> 10:06.188
When I tug three times,
I've got the kid.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.317
Please, God!
Please find my boy.

10:34.426 --> 10:35.968
All right, he's at the bottom.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.900
Three tugs, he's got him!

10:54.863 --> 10:56.113
Medics, get ready.

10:56.281 --> 10:58.157
Mills, go in the
ambulance as back-up.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.325
Right.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.662
Oh my God.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.998
Is he alive?
Patrick.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.005
Put him
in the rig now!

11:25.268 --> 11:26.310
Pushing epinephrine.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.490
Shay, check
for lung silence.
Yeah.

11:42.994 --> 11:44.370
Come on, Patrick.

11:50.293 --> 11:51.627
Good.
Let's do a pulse check.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.673
Come on,
Patrick. Come on.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.517
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a second.

12:06.684 --> 12:07.851
What?

12:09.562 --> 12:10.521
I have a pulse.

12:10.688 --> 12:11.688
Are you sure?

12:13.191 --> 12:15.317
Yeah. Yeah, pulses!

12:19.531 --> 12:20.697
B.P. Is 60 over 40.

12:40.218 --> 12:42.177
Hey.
Hey.

12:42.345 --> 12:43.554
How's the kid?
Good.

12:43.721 --> 12:44.972
Yeah?
Yeah.

12:45.140 --> 12:47.474
Got him warmed up,
his B.P.'s stabilized.

12:47.642 --> 12:48.892
Lieutenant.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.644
Hey, I just heard
the news. That's great.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.563
Yeah, thanks to you guys.

12:52.730 --> 12:53.730
Um...

12:55.692 --> 12:57.651
I just want you
to know, uh,

12:58.695 --> 12:59.903
I didn't...

13:01.739 --> 13:03.907
My son was in that water,

13:05.034 --> 13:06.577
and I froze.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.579
I did nothing.
Sir...

13:08.746 --> 13:11.165
I don't know why.
I just stood there.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.708
I wanted to move
but my feet wouldn't...

13:12.876 --> 13:14.001
Listen to me.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.796
I've been to thousands
of accident scenes,

13:17.964 --> 13:19.548
and you never know,
any given day,

13:19.716 --> 13:20.632
how someone's
going to react.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.509
Yeah, but I did nothing.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.136
He's my son,
and I did nothing.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.597
That's cold,
dangerous water.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.224
You went in there,
we'd have been
rescuing two.

13:30.101 --> 13:32.519
If you hadn't shown up.
But we did.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.356
And now your boy's
going to be fine.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.237
And you're going
to be here to
take him home.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.073
Okay?

13:47.243 --> 13:48.494
Okay. Thanks.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.254
Let me handle this.

13:59.422 --> 14:00.797
All right.
All right.

14:01.841 --> 14:05.302
Hey!
Hey, Arthur.
Sorry for the wait.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.346
Ah, not a problem.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.640
I appreciate
what you guys do.

14:09.807 --> 14:12.100
We wanted to open
the lines of communication,

14:12.268 --> 14:13.560
and let you know
our perspective

14:13.728 --> 14:15.979
on the whole
partnership thing.

14:16.147 --> 14:18.732
So, with the Latino girl,
we're four, right?

14:18.900 --> 14:21.235
I think that's
actually Latina.

14:21.402 --> 14:22.653
Oh, yeah. Sorry, yeah.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.279
Look, I'm no math major,

14:24.447 --> 14:28.575
but partnership-wise, uh,
that's, 25% stake each. No?

14:28.743 --> 14:29.660
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no.

14:29.827 --> 14:32.454
The old man
definitely did not
say equal partnership.

14:32.622 --> 14:33.539
He said take care of you

14:33.706 --> 14:35.832
based upon what you
brought to the table.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.463
So, construction, hauling,
initial investment...

14:41.631 --> 14:43.173
I don't have a lot of
out-of-pocket money

14:43.341 --> 14:45.717
to do any investing.
I... so...

14:48.012 --> 14:49.846
We're not
talking 25%, then.

14:51.683 --> 14:55.686
Okay, sure. Yeah.
No, I get your point.

14:55.853 --> 14:58.689
Listen, let's
just see what you
bring to the table,

14:58.856 --> 15:02.526
we'll see how it goes
and we'll make sure
that it's fair.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.697
Sounds great.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.115
Uh, look, I got
to get back to work,

15:08.283 --> 15:10.701
but I'll see you tomorrow
at the inspection, huh?

15:10.868 --> 15:12.244
Yeah.
Okay.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.085
Hi, there, little guy.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.712
You know,
Daniel's planning
on using the fact

15:21.879 --> 15:24.423
that I was in therapy
and on anti-depressants

15:24.591 --> 15:27.301
as proof that
I'm mentally unstable.

15:27.468 --> 15:30.345
Screw Daniel.
We're strong enough.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.764
We'll handle whatever
he throws our way.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.726
Well, the lawyer
did say there was
another option.

15:35.893 --> 15:36.935
What?

15:37.895 --> 15:40.731
We could offer
50-50 custody.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.400
Clarice...
I know Daniel
will take it.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.528
You know, and then
we can just end all of this

15:46.696 --> 15:48.071
and focus on
being a family.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.539
Hey, you. Hi.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.377
Okay.

16:23.941 --> 16:24.941
Knock, knock.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.196
Hey.
Hey.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.116
I'd be dead
if you hadn't
been there.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.454
No, you'd have
crawled your way
to the front door.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.039
Has anybody
come talk to you?

16:40.416 --> 16:43.794
Yeah, some detective
from Narcotics named Vikan.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.420
Hey.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.047
He's after my badge.

16:49.092 --> 16:51.176
He's saying you've
gone off the rails.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.511
Look, this started out

16:52.679 --> 16:54.805
as prostitutes getting
a hold of bad dope.

16:54.972 --> 16:58.266
That's a Vice case.
Which is why
I got involved.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.769
Then it turned into
the bad dope being dealt.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.562
That's when
Narcotics came in.

17:02.730 --> 17:03.939
Hey.
Then it became about
that new gang

17:04.107 --> 17:05.065
that I was
telling you about,

17:05.233 --> 17:06.983
trying to push
their way in
and take over.

17:10.988 --> 17:11.988
Laura and the kids?

17:13.574 --> 17:15.409
Department's putting
them in protective custody

17:15.576 --> 17:17.494
until they catch
who tried to kill me.

17:17.662 --> 17:18.787
Have they been threatened?

17:20.581 --> 17:22.999
There's been some
hang ups on our
home phone line.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.216
If this was all about gangs,

17:31.384 --> 17:33.009
there is one cop who
could have helped out.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.389
Don't even think about it.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.509
Uh...

18:16.304 --> 18:19.556
My name is Gabriela...
I know who you are.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.475
What the hell do you want?

18:28.191 --> 18:30.567
My brother,
Antonio Dawson,
he works in Vice.

18:30.735 --> 18:33.570
Yeah, yeah, he's the guy
who put the cuffs on me.

18:33.738 --> 18:35.655
You tell him
I said hi, okay?

18:36.741 --> 18:38.825
Okay, well this involves him.

18:38.993 --> 18:40.410
So if you've got
your panties in a twist

18:40.578 --> 18:42.579
over how he does
his job and that's
a deal breaker for you,

18:42.747 --> 18:43.955
you just say so
and I'll leave.

18:46.334 --> 18:47.709
Continue.

18:50.338 --> 18:51.588
He's investigating
some bad dope

18:51.756 --> 18:53.840
that's been dumped
on prostitutes.

18:54.008 --> 18:55.342
It's about some new gangs...

18:55.510 --> 18:57.344
Look, I've heard
all about that.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.014
He was shot a
couple of days ago.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.851
But this is more than
just him and his family

19:05.019 --> 19:07.729
still having a bullseye
on their chest.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.731
Girls are dying out there.

19:09.899 --> 19:13.610
If my brother was
willing to risk his
life trying to stop it,

19:13.778 --> 19:16.363
I'm willing to risk
mine trying to help him.

19:20.076 --> 19:23.161
My ex-partner
had a thing he
liked to say.

19:23.329 --> 19:24.788
What was the first
thing Adam said

19:24.956 --> 19:26.790
when the good Lord
dropped him in Eden?

19:29.794 --> 19:31.461
What's in it for me?

19:34.048 --> 19:35.632
You know, I came here
on the off chance

19:35.800 --> 19:36.633
that despite what happened,

19:36.801 --> 19:39.928
you might still care
about trying to prevent
people from dying.

19:40.096 --> 19:41.763
I don't know what
your jail situation is.

19:41.931 --> 19:44.766
As a former cop,
I'm assuming
you're segregated, so...

19:46.394 --> 19:48.270
Maybe by helping out
that would go a ways

19:48.437 --> 19:49.938
to getting you some better...

19:50.106 --> 19:51.439
Ah.

19:51.607 --> 19:52.858
I don't know,
accommodations?

19:54.819 --> 19:58.530
Then this conversation
becomes about favors.

20:05.830 --> 20:06.830
Okay.

20:07.832 --> 20:09.165
Okay what?

20:10.793 --> 20:12.919
Okay, you help me,
I'll help you.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.049
You're going
to want to talk
to a guy named T.T.

20:19.176 --> 20:22.971
He operates out of a
two-story on the corner
of 27th and State.

20:23.139 --> 20:25.390
But I wouldn't advise
you come knocking
for him on your own.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.808
Yeah, well I can take
care of myself.

20:27.852 --> 20:28.894
Fine.

20:30.146 --> 20:31.396
Just tell him
Voight sent you,

20:31.564 --> 20:33.815
you're looking for
someone to testify
about the Red Hooks.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.568
That's the gang
your brother was
trying to take down.

20:36.736 --> 20:37.986
T.T. Owes me.

20:38.154 --> 20:41.865
And he's motivated 'cause
the Red Hooks are trying
to move in on his action.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.869
Yeah, okay.
All right, got it.
T.T. Got it.

20:46.829 --> 20:48.872
I'll be seeing you around.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.879
Thanks for your help.

21:02.386 --> 21:03.637
I don't get this
inspector, man.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.555
This bar's been
here for 30 years,

21:05.723 --> 21:07.432
and the old man said
he never had a problem.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.642
Shut up.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.394
So how's it looking?

21:11.562 --> 21:15.148
Unfortunately,
we have issues, main
one being the layout.

21:15.316 --> 21:17.651
Your kitchen and bar area
are too close together.

21:17.818 --> 21:20.403
Mr. Stephanides
said that you've
always approved it.

21:20.571 --> 21:22.864
Ah, well, see, that's
a different situation.

21:23.032 --> 21:25.533
Mr. Stephanides and I
had an understanding.

21:27.036 --> 21:30.246
Okay,
let me handle this.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.180
Oh, God.

21:53.604 --> 21:55.230
What, are you posing
for a calendar?

21:55.398 --> 21:57.691
It's called the
football hold.

21:57.858 --> 21:58.858
Oh!

22:00.444 --> 22:02.862
Thank God he looks
like Clarice.

22:05.825 --> 22:06.700
Was he crying?

22:06.867 --> 22:08.034
No, not too bad.

22:08.869 --> 22:11.371
I must've been
out like a light.
I'm so sorry.

22:11.539 --> 22:14.082
No, it's fine.
Really. I don't mind.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.251
Hey, this attorney
you guys got.

22:16.419 --> 22:17.419
Mmm-hmm.

22:17.586 --> 22:18.878
Do you think he can
locate people?

22:19.755 --> 22:20.755
Like?

22:21.674 --> 22:23.675
Like Renee. Whaley.

22:25.886 --> 22:26.720
Really?

22:26.887 --> 22:28.013
No, it's not like that.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.515
Eric came to me,
asking if I could
reach out.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.726
I guess they've all
tried and failed and...

22:32.893 --> 22:36.229
He gave me a cell number,
I left a message,

22:36.397 --> 22:38.898
Maybe if I just
showed up and...

22:42.903 --> 22:44.738
I don't even know
why I'm talking about this.

22:44.905 --> 22:46.740
You're talking about it
because it might help.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.742
I mean, what would I
even gain from this?

22:48.909 --> 22:49.909
Nothing.

22:51.912 --> 22:52.912
What?

22:53.914 --> 22:54.914
I...

22:56.208 --> 23:00.211
Today at the hospital
you reach out to some
father you've never met but...

23:01.630 --> 23:04.799
You don't want to try
and help out someone
you almost married?

23:38.542 --> 23:41.628
Uh, my name's Gabriela.
I'm looking for T.T.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.385
Why is you asking
around about me, bitch?

23:55.976 --> 23:58.561
Voight. Detective Voight.

23:58.729 --> 24:00.313
He told me to come see you.

24:00.481 --> 24:01.815
You a cop?

24:01.982 --> 24:04.192
I'm Gabriela Dawson.
Firehouse 51.

24:04.360 --> 24:05.527
I need your help.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.821
My brother's a cop
and he was shot last night.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.322
Girls are dying
from bad dope.

24:09.490 --> 24:12.033
You know this 'cause
they're trying to
move in on you.

24:13.994 --> 24:16.996
Voight told me that you can
get somebody to testify
against the Red Hooks.

24:22.336 --> 24:23.837
You come around here again,

24:24.004 --> 24:26.923
I'm going to blow
your head clean off.

24:27.842 --> 24:29.717
Do you understand me?

25:18.601 --> 25:19.684
Renee.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.150
Be right back.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.950
Kelly Severide.

25:37.703 --> 25:38.912
Good seeing you.
How you doing?

25:40.080 --> 25:41.623
What brings you?

25:41.790 --> 25:43.791
Or is this just one hell
of an awkward coincidence.

25:43.959 --> 25:48.630
No, um, I'm working
with Eric at the
same house. 51.

25:48.797 --> 25:49.756
Oh.

25:49.924 --> 25:52.508
And he asked
if I'd come...

25:52.676 --> 25:54.302
I'm doing fine.

25:59.266 --> 26:01.059
Is that what you
came to find out?

26:02.728 --> 26:03.937
I guess so, yeah.

26:04.104 --> 26:06.356
Well your question's
been answered then.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.316
Thanks for your concern.

26:27.795 --> 26:31.214
This is probably
going to come as
a surprise to you.

26:31.382 --> 26:33.675
Jail visitation
logs are monitored.

26:33.842 --> 26:36.761
Certainly those
concerning dirty ex-cops.

26:37.805 --> 26:39.681
I got a call.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.557
Several, in fact.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.601
What's my response
going to be, Gabby?

26:45.980 --> 26:48.606
I went there to see
if Voight would
provide any help

26:48.774 --> 26:50.858
with the
Antonio thing.
Gabby.

26:58.575 --> 27:01.035
I can't do anything about
what you do off-shift,

27:01.203 --> 27:03.121
so I will save my breath.

27:04.248 --> 27:06.249
But I will give you
a bit of advice.

27:06.417 --> 27:08.001
The news on this
is going to travel fast.

27:08.168 --> 27:10.420
It sure as hell
got to me quick.

27:10.587 --> 27:14.799
So, you may want
to bring in a certain
someone from this house

27:16.385 --> 27:18.261
before it gets
on the grapevine,

27:19.138 --> 27:21.306
and he forms
his own opinion.

27:26.270 --> 27:28.646
They tried to
kill Antonio and
for all I know,

27:28.814 --> 27:30.273
they still may want
to finish the job.

27:30.441 --> 27:33.234
Plus, all
those O.D.'s...
Voight tried
to take me out!

27:33.402 --> 27:35.278
He's a liar
and a crook.
I know.

27:35.446 --> 27:37.655
But sometimes you've
got to, you know,

27:37.823 --> 27:39.615
dance with the devil.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.827
Really? Is that
the way it works?

27:44.955 --> 27:48.291
Casey, I didn't
feel like I had
any other choice.

27:49.835 --> 27:52.962
I'm sorry.
Hey. Just do what
you need to do, okay?

27:53.130 --> 27:54.547
I hope it works out.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.024
Hey, Eric.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.692
Kelly.

28:14.860 --> 28:18.071
So um, I saw Renee.

28:18.238 --> 28:19.697
You're kidding.
No.

28:20.991 --> 28:22.367
That's great!

28:23.410 --> 28:24.786
Or was it?

28:24.953 --> 28:26.662
Yeah, no, she's...

28:26.830 --> 28:27.914
She's doing fine.

28:28.082 --> 28:29.707
Where'd you find her?

28:29.875 --> 28:31.376
At this bar she works at.

28:31.543 --> 28:32.627
Cocktail waitress?

28:33.545 --> 28:34.837
Basically, yeah.

28:35.798 --> 28:37.423
She good? She happy?

28:37.591 --> 28:39.008
Yeah, she seems happy.

28:40.928 --> 28:42.720
Thanks.
Mmm-hmm.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.889
Hopefully I'll
hear from her.
Hope so.

28:50.479 --> 28:52.480
Big day! We just
heard the news.

28:52.648 --> 28:53.648
Congratulations.

28:54.650 --> 28:56.818
I think a toast
is in order here. Huh?

28:56.985 --> 28:58.653
This is vodka

28:58.821 --> 29:01.114
my parents brought
back straight from
the homeland.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.741
Now, Herrmann
and I are on duty,

29:03.909 --> 29:09.122
so we can't imbibe,
but don't let
that stop you.

29:14.002 --> 29:15.002
Um...

29:16.130 --> 29:17.380
I'll pass.

29:18.924 --> 29:21.759
If you'll just, uh,
sign where the X's are,

29:21.927 --> 29:23.302
and you'll be all set.

29:25.097 --> 29:28.224
I want to apologize
for any misunderstanding.

29:28.392 --> 29:30.643
I'll get these into
the system right away,

29:30.811 --> 29:33.771
and you'll get your
fully executed copies
in the mail shortly.

29:37.526 --> 29:40.278
You know, I was
thinking about our
first conversation about...

29:41.405 --> 29:43.114
what it is
I bring to the table.

29:44.116 --> 29:47.577
I bring a lot
of intangibles,
I think they call it.

29:47.744 --> 29:52.373
In fact, I'd say
I bring 25% worth.

30:03.051 --> 30:05.011
You got to
stop this now.

30:06.597 --> 30:08.139
You want to
get shot, too?

30:10.142 --> 30:11.309
Just...

30:12.394 --> 30:14.604
Let the
investigation
play itself out.

30:16.273 --> 30:18.149
I think I just
ruined a friendship.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.277
With who?

30:24.239 --> 30:28.242
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Battalion 25, Ambulance 61.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.870
House Collapse.
1600 Block, North Poplar.

30:41.006 --> 30:43.758
The ceiling fell in,
it sounded like thunder.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.677
We'll take a look.
Stay back.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.763
Our upstairs neighbor,
he's a crazy hoarder.

30:48.931 --> 30:50.973
Keeps all these
magazines and newspapers.

30:51.141 --> 30:52.725
We could hear the floor
creaking for months.

30:52.893 --> 30:54.310
Have you seen him?

30:54.478 --> 30:56.229
Ma'am, will you
move to the corner.

30:56.396 --> 30:57.438
This building
is compromised.

30:57.606 --> 30:58.689
Everybody proceed
with caution.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.108
The main level collapsed
into the basement.

31:01.276 --> 31:02.568
We can't get in from here.

31:02.736 --> 31:03.945
Where's the entrance
to the basement?

31:04.112 --> 31:05.738
The door's open.
Oh my God!

31:05.906 --> 31:08.157
My daughter goes
down there with her
boyfriend sometimes.

31:08.325 --> 31:09.492
Okay, we're going in.

31:09.660 --> 31:11.702
Truck Squad, get all the
airbags and cribbing we have.

31:11.870 --> 31:12.870
Get it out here, now!

31:23.840 --> 31:26.175
We need to create a tunnel
using airbags and cribbing.

31:26.343 --> 31:28.928
We'll slide 'em in one
by one, and then we use
the cribbing as support.

31:29.096 --> 31:31.013
Severide,
you're in front.
Call out the line.

31:32.140 --> 31:35.268
All right. Casey, Herrmann,
Capp, Cruz, Hadley, Mills,

31:35.435 --> 31:37.895
you guys are with me,
the rest of you guys,
up to feed the line. Go!

31:56.999 --> 31:58.958
Cribbing!
More cribbing.

32:21.231 --> 32:23.149
All right, up on yellow.

32:42.586 --> 32:44.545
Send the Stokes basket
down the tunnel!

32:44.713 --> 32:45.796
The Stokes basket.

32:45.964 --> 32:49.717
You guys okay?
Yeah, yeah. I think so.

32:50.719 --> 32:55.431
Oh baby! Oh my baby!
There you go.
She's okay, Ma.

32:55.599 --> 32:56.849
Got banged around a little.

33:05.901 --> 33:07.735
There's a young woman
in the briefing room,

33:07.903 --> 33:09.487
who says she
wants to talk to you.

33:16.286 --> 33:17.703
You Gabriela?

33:18.830 --> 33:19.830
I am.

33:21.416 --> 33:23.417
T.T. Told me
to come here.

33:26.088 --> 33:27.672
I'm glad you did.

33:28.632 --> 33:31.092
And I can trust you?

33:31.259 --> 33:33.636
You can.
Because I'm not playing
around, all right?

33:33.804 --> 33:35.805
If I'm going to help,
I need assurances.

33:35.972 --> 33:38.599
I need to get
out of town for
my testimony.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.685
They'll kill me in
a second if they
knew I was here.

33:40.852 --> 33:44.689
Whatever you need.
It'll be taken care of.
You have my word.

33:47.317 --> 33:48.693
What do you know?

33:49.903 --> 33:51.404
Everything.

34:24.980 --> 34:26.897
Hey, partner.

34:43.290 --> 34:44.540
Arthur,

34:47.085 --> 34:49.336
I want to come
clean with you.

34:55.385 --> 34:56.385
All right,

34:56.553 --> 34:58.262
the thing is,
I've got
a checkered history

34:58.430 --> 35:00.181
in terms of
business investments.

35:01.349 --> 35:04.518
Some people,
they hoard broken junk.

35:05.479 --> 35:08.481
Well, I hoard
broken opportunities.

35:09.649 --> 35:14.195
My point is, is that
I'm really looking forward
to owning this bar.

35:15.864 --> 35:18.240
It's an investment
opportunity that

35:18.408 --> 35:20.409
I truly believe

35:20.577 --> 35:21.786
is going to work.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.662
So what's the problem?

35:24.664 --> 35:26.332
You're the problem.

35:27.834 --> 35:32.046
You're a bully, and you
use threats and violence
to intimidate people.

35:32.214 --> 35:34.840
So if you want
to have at it,

35:35.884 --> 35:37.259
and smash up my legs

35:37.427 --> 35:40.679
just like you did
that poor bastard
inspector,

35:40.847 --> 35:42.348
then have at it.

35:44.559 --> 35:45.559
I mean it.

35:46.603 --> 35:47.728
Is that right?

35:48.897 --> 35:50.898
I'm a firefighter, Arthur.

35:52.943 --> 35:56.821
I see a lot of things
that, believe me,
you don't want to see.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.906
I don't get squeamish.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.914
Instead of 25 percent

36:07.916 --> 36:09.083
you get one.

36:09.960 --> 36:13.921
One percent of what
I foresee as being
pretty solid profits,

36:14.840 --> 36:16.048
all for doing nothing

36:16.216 --> 36:18.759
but walking away
from our bar,

36:18.927 --> 36:20.511
and staying away.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.900
I'll expect
my one percent monthly.

36:49.916 --> 36:52.459
Any word back yet
from Daniel on
that 50-50 offer?

36:52.627 --> 36:54.461
No, not yet.
Oh, he'll take it.

36:54.629 --> 36:57.423
It's the best deal
he's going to get
and he knows it.

36:59.342 --> 37:03.220
Well, Wesley's going
to have a good man
in his life, regardless.

37:03.388 --> 37:05.806
That's nice of you to say.

37:05.974 --> 37:07.808
All right, well,
there you have it.

37:07.976 --> 37:10.603
I can keep it in my room
until you're ready
to swap it out.

37:15.650 --> 37:16.483
Eric.

37:16.651 --> 37:18.819
You sure Renee
seemed okay when
you talked to her?

37:18.987 --> 37:20.070
Yeah, why?

37:20.238 --> 37:22.114
I just got a call
from a hospital.

37:22.282 --> 37:23.490
She took
a bunch of pills.

37:35.045 --> 37:37.588
I told you not to go
Gabby on this.

37:38.423 --> 37:39.840
I know you did.

37:42.510 --> 37:45.512
Captain just told
me your girl gave
a full statement,

37:45.680 --> 37:48.140
including the identity
of the shooter.

37:48.308 --> 37:49.558
This ends it, right?

37:49.726 --> 37:51.602
It should.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.729
But what did you
promise Voight?

37:54.689 --> 37:58.525
I told him
I'd return the favor,
whatever that means.

37:59.402 --> 38:01.528
You're in bed with
this guy now, Gabby.

38:01.696 --> 38:02.905
Hey,

38:04.699 --> 38:06.909
someone tried
to kill my brother.

38:08.703 --> 38:10.746
And if you mess
with my family
you mess with me.

38:10.914 --> 38:12.915
I don't regret what I did.

38:14.709 --> 38:16.543
I love you.

38:16.711 --> 38:18.712
And I'm proud
to be your brother.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.064
I'm so sorry, Matt.

38:37.232 --> 38:39.608
Ron and I just kinda
lost track of time,

38:39.776 --> 38:41.026
and something happened
with his car.

38:41.194 --> 38:42.569
I don't know,
it had something to
do with the clutch.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.071
And it broke down on us,

38:44.239 --> 38:45.698
right on the Eisenhower,
of course.

38:45.865 --> 38:49.576
We had to call a tow truck,
go to the service center.

38:49.744 --> 38:53.497
Do you want me to
get the driver's card,
or the receipt?

38:54.749 --> 38:56.750
Yeah. Get them for me.

39:00.338 --> 39:03.257
I don't know
why I even bother.

39:03.425 --> 39:05.592
You have two weeks
to find a new place.

39:05.760 --> 39:06.969
What?

39:07.137 --> 39:09.179
Where am I going to live?
Where am I going to go?

39:09.347 --> 39:10.472
I don't know.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.852
But you've got
two weeks
to figure it out.

39:18.773 --> 39:21.150
He chipped away
at me, you know?

39:22.068 --> 39:24.069
Every day,

39:25.238 --> 39:26.739
your father.

39:30.243 --> 39:33.787
He convinced me
that not only wasn't
I a worthy mother,

39:36.499 --> 39:39.460
I wasn't even
a worthy person.
I believed him.

39:42.047 --> 39:45.632
And then he started
to do it to you every day,

39:45.800 --> 39:48.802
another sidelong
comment,
another criticism.

39:50.805 --> 39:53.098
You remember it,
I know you do.

39:54.267 --> 39:57.644
You started to
internalize it,
and my worst

39:57.812 --> 40:02.107
fear was coming true,
that he was going to do
to you what he did to me.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.696
So that night
he called,

40:08.615 --> 40:09.823
we argued,

40:13.328 --> 40:15.079
and he said something

40:16.122 --> 40:17.539
about you.

40:18.458 --> 40:19.792
Something

40:21.544 --> 40:22.836
so cruel,

40:25.423 --> 40:26.840
and I snapped.

40:30.220 --> 40:32.805
And I went and
I got the gun

40:32.972 --> 40:35.849
out of the box that
he kept in the closet,

40:38.019 --> 40:40.854
and I took
the house key
that you left out,

40:44.776 --> 40:46.652
and I drove across town

40:48.321 --> 40:49.863
and I shot him.

40:53.868 --> 40:55.786
Just to shut him up.

40:57.539 --> 41:01.208
Just to never hear
those words coming
out of his mouth again.

41:04.504 --> 41:06.130
I know what
you're thinking.

41:08.883 --> 41:10.884
I know what
you've thought.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.429
But I know you, Matthew.

41:15.598 --> 41:18.684
You don't have
that kind of anger
inside of you,

41:19.602 --> 41:22.229
that ability to
completely lose control.

41:25.608 --> 41:26.984
You're not me.

41:30.572 --> 41:33.490
And I think that's
what you really
wanted to know.
