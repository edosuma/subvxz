00:08.250 --> 00:09.625
It was pretty cool of Milton's parents

00:09.709 --> 00:11.500
to let him have his party
here at the go-kart track.

00:11.583 --> 00:13.250
It's better than last year
when he had his party

00:13.333 --> 00:14.750
at the same time as his little sister's.

00:14.834 --> 00:16.125
Teddy bear theme in the front yard,

00:16.208 --> 00:17.250
pirate theme in the backyard.

00:17.333 --> 00:19.709
Hey, I thought his sister's pirate party
was a blast.

00:22.166 --> 00:23.083
Whoo.

00:23.166 --> 00:24.875
I think I'm gonna sit it out for a while.

00:24.959 --> 00:27.417
My stomach is up in my throat
after that last ride.

00:27.875 --> 00:29.583
I didn't see you out on the go-kart track.

00:29.917 --> 00:30.875
Oh, I wasn't.

00:30.959 --> 00:32.917
I was over in the rocket ship
by the ball pit.

00:35.959 --> 00:38.083
They should put a safety warning
on that thing.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.709
Guys, you gotta check this out.

00:41.792 --> 00:44.375
The driver in the blue kart
is tearing up the track.

00:47.583 --> 00:49.875
Whoa. It looks like
he might break the course record.

00:49.959 --> 00:51.667
You know, I could have broke
the course record

00:51.750 --> 00:54.792
if Jerry wasn't driving the wrong way
and crashed me into the wall.

00:55.166 --> 00:56.834
Hey, I was going the wrong way

00:56.917 --> 00:58.959
because I dropped my corn dog
at the start line.

00:59.041 --> 01:00.750
And my family lives by a code.

01:04.041 --> 01:05.000
What's that mean?

01:05.083 --> 01:06.333
No corn dog left behind.

01:07.667 --> 01:08.667
Oh, he's on his last lap.

01:08.750 --> 01:09.834
It's gonna be close.

01:11.166 --> 01:12.709
<i>Three minutes and 21 seconds.</i>

01:12.792 --> 01:14.834
<i>that's a new track record, folks.</i>

01:15.125 --> 01:17.166
- Oh. That was awesome.
- That was amazing.

01:18.375 --> 01:19.333
That was Kim?

01:21.291 --> 01:22.625
Kim, you can really drive.

01:22.709 --> 01:24.291
Were you trying
to break the course record?

01:24.333 --> 01:26.083
No, I just really gotta go
to the bathroom.

01:28.959 --> 01:30.667
Yo, check it out. There's my corn dog.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.000
- No, Jerry. No!
- No, Jerry. Don't!

a girl doesn't give a boy a turtleneck

02:39.333 --> 02:41.542
unless she's trying to say something.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Maybe she's trying to say
you have an ugly neck.

02:48.291 --> 02:50.333
Hey, did you guys see
what's in Phil's window?

02:50.375 --> 02:53.250
Oh, are you talking about the cockroaches
trying to claw their way to freedom?

02:54.375 --> 02:56.083
No. This flyer.

02:56.917 --> 02:59.417
Oh, the Junior National 500 Go-kart Race

02:59.500 --> 03:01.250
is being held here
at the Seaford Racetrack.

03:01.333 --> 03:02.417
Kim, you've got to do this.

03:03.041 --> 03:04.917
Guys, do you know how much money
that would take?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.917
I mean, the go-kart, the pit crew,
highlights for my hair.

03:10.125 --> 03:12.208
What? When I win,
I'm gonna look good doing it.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.041
Guys, all we need is a sponsor.

03:15.125 --> 03:16.667
Yeah. That's not gonna be a problem.

03:16.750 --> 03:19.250
Oh, we'll just wait for some crazy man
with a lot of money

03:19.333 --> 03:20.625
to come rolling in here.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.667
I'll have a number seven platter.

03:29.750 --> 03:32.333
Oh, and can you make change
for this giant sapphire?

03:33.375 --> 03:34.792
Oh, you know what? Just keep it.

03:37.333 --> 03:38.625
Oh, good, Milton.

03:38.709 --> 03:41.375
You've finally covered up
that ugly turkey neck of yours.

03:42.959 --> 03:45.583
Bobby, how would you like
to sponsor a go-kart team?

03:45.667 --> 03:47.250
Absolutely not.

03:47.375 --> 03:48.583
We'll put your face on the kart.

03:48.667 --> 03:51.083
I'm in. Daddy loves his face.

Hey, Rudy.

03:59.125 --> 04:01.542
I just came by
to have you sign a petition I'm starting

04:01.625 --> 04:03.834
to name you the world's sexiest sensei.

04:04.333 --> 04:07.375
Uh, I'd have to be pretty full of myself
to sign my own pet...

04:07.458 --> 04:08.291
Do you have a pen?

04:10.458 --> 04:11.333
Yes.

04:11.458 --> 04:12.792
Wait, this is from your school.

04:13.917 --> 04:15.458
You didn't finish your community service?

04:15.542 --> 04:18.000
And now, thanks to your signature,
I won't have to.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.542
Jerry, volunteering is very important.

04:20.625 --> 04:21.458
Everyone should do it.

04:22.000 --> 04:22.834
Let me ask you,

04:22.917 --> 04:25.375
when was the last time
you did something for your fellow man?

04:25.792 --> 04:27.500
I mean, just today, I was at clown burger

04:27.583 --> 04:30.250
and some lady walked away
and left her cheeseburger on the counter.

04:30.375 --> 04:32.709
That's great.
So you ran after her and you gave it back?

04:32.792 --> 04:35.625
Oh, no, I ate it immediately knowing
she wouldn't want it to go to waste.

04:38.750 --> 04:41.583
Jerry, volunteering can be very rewarding.

04:42.166 --> 04:43.875
What was it that you were supposed to do?

04:44.417 --> 04:46.834
I was supposed to bring meals
and help out some old man.

04:46.917 --> 04:49.083
Well, not only are you gonna do it,

04:49.166 --> 04:50.417
but I'm gonna go with you.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.500
Wow, Rudy.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.542
You have a huge heart, huh?

04:53.625 --> 04:54.834
I love helping people.

04:56.208 --> 04:57.834
- Oh, sorry.

04:58.875 --> 04:59.792
Hello, mother?

05:00.709 --> 05:02.834
Ooh. That sounds painful.

05:03.583 --> 05:04.542
No, no, no, I can't.

05:05.083 --> 05:06.000
No, I can't.

05:06.083 --> 05:08.500
Just pack it in ice
and drive yourself to the hospital.

05:11.083 --> 05:12.000
Come on, Jerry.

05:12.083 --> 05:13.250
Let's go help some people.

05:19.166 --> 05:21.083
Oh, hey. Kim, check it out.

05:21.166 --> 05:22.667
When you sign up
for the big race tomorrow,

05:22.750 --> 05:23.875
you get one of these cool pens.

05:25.667 --> 05:27.709
It's a "Vroom Vroom" pen.

05:28.208 --> 05:30.750
Look, Jack, I don't care
about some cheesy pen.

05:30.834 --> 05:33.291
What I care about is you
coming down here to support me.

05:33.417 --> 05:35.250
I mean, it really shows
how important I am to you.

05:35.333 --> 05:37.875
And you just want me to shut up
so you can play with your pen, don't you?

05:37.959 --> 05:39.083
So badly.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.959
Hi, I'm Luc Monaco.

05:43.041 --> 05:44.750
Chairman of the Racing Association.

05:44.834 --> 05:46.250
Looking to sign up for a race, son?

05:46.333 --> 05:49.125
Uh, actually,
uh, I'm gonna be the one racing.

05:49.583 --> 05:50.625
Hence the highlights.

05:51.333 --> 05:52.917
You can't race in this division.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.417
You're a girl. Tell her, dad.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.041
Tad's right. You're a girl!

05:57.625 --> 06:01.125
Which means you have to race
in the girls' division, hon.

06:01.208 --> 06:05.166
But my time is better than almost everyone
in the boys' division, hon.

06:05.875 --> 06:07.834
You could put on
one of those cute little outfits

06:07.917 --> 06:10.041
and wave the checkered flag when I win.

06:11.750 --> 06:13.125
You'd look really good in one--

06:13.208 --> 06:14.291
But that's not the point.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.291
She has every right to race with the guys.

06:17.375 --> 06:18.458
Not gonna happen.

06:19.750 --> 06:20.500
You know,

06:20.583 --> 06:22.667
you may have taken away
my ability to race,

06:22.750 --> 06:24.667
but you will never take away
my "Vroom Vroom" pen.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.125
Those pens are for racers only.

06:28.041 --> 06:28.917
Fine.

06:31.709 --> 06:33.208
One "Vroom Vroom" pen for the little lady.

06:33.250 --> 06:34.667
- Thank you.

06:34.750 --> 06:35.875
You're a smart man.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.417
Hello, Harvey.

06:43.750 --> 06:46.542
I'm Rudy, and this is Jerry.

06:46.625 --> 06:48.583
And we're your volunteers.

06:48.667 --> 06:50.750
I'm not deaf!

06:51.291 --> 06:52.750
And you're late.

06:56.834 --> 07:00.250
This turkey sandwich
is supposed to come with chips.

07:00.333 --> 07:01.417
Uh, it's the boy's fault.

07:02.333 --> 07:03.834
Rudy, you ate those--

07:03.917 --> 07:06.250
Respect your elders, Jerry.

07:06.750 --> 07:07.917
Am I right, Harv?

07:08.000 --> 07:08.834
All right.

07:08.917 --> 07:10.625
Let's just get to your chores.

07:10.709 --> 07:13.041
One of you has to help me with my pottery,

07:13.125 --> 07:14.750
the other one has to plunge the toilet.

07:14.834 --> 07:16.542
Pottery, pottery, pottery!

07:19.583 --> 07:20.875
You don't want to switch, do you?

07:21.333 --> 07:22.917
No, I certainly do not.

07:25.458 --> 07:29.166
All right, you work this with your hands
till you get it nice and soft.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.625
So I can sculpt my cups.

07:31.709 --> 07:32.834
That's my hobby.

07:37.333 --> 07:39.166
You know, this clay feels kind of weird.

07:39.792 --> 07:40.625
What kind is it?

07:40.709 --> 07:41.959
Clay? What clay?

07:42.041 --> 07:43.417
- That's my earwax.

09:32.542 --> 09:34.417

experience than the video game.

If I'd have just made it
around that first wall,

09:59.041 --> 10:00.458
I think I'd have really taken off.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.709
Yeah, right into that second wall.

- No, I'm not.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.667
Kim has no chance
in that crummy rental kart.

10:41.250 --> 10:42.125
Kim.

10:42.917 --> 10:46.333
Would you do me the great favor
of racing my face?

10:47.500 --> 10:48.458
Bobby...

10:49.917 --> 10:51.000
I'd be honored.

10:51.083 --> 10:52.250
All right, guys.

10:52.458 --> 10:53.667
If we're gonna pull this off, Kim,

10:53.750 --> 10:55.500
from now on,
you're gonna have to act like a dude.

10:55.583 --> 10:57.083
Jack, trust me. I got this.

10:57.166 --> 10:58.000
Team Wasabi?

10:59.333 --> 11:00.709
Team Wasabi!

11:00.792 --> 11:03.250
Oh, my gosh, I'm so excited.
This is gonna be so much fun.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.709
I mean, let's do this.

11:11.375 --> 11:13.250
<i>♪ Here we go, let's start the party ♪</i>

11:13.375 --> 11:15.250
<i>♪ Chop it up like it's karate ♪</i>

11:16.959 --> 11:19.500
I can't believe he's got us cleaning out
his refrigerator.

11:19.583 --> 11:21.083
It's disgusting in there.

11:21.417 --> 11:22.333
Oh, I don't know.

11:22.709 --> 11:24.834
Looks like he's got
some pretty interesting eats in here.

11:29.041 --> 11:30.959
Don't leave that refrigerator open.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.458
I have a sample of something
I need to bring to the doctor.

11:37.208 --> 11:40.208
And when you're finished with that,
throw out this box of junk.

11:43.875 --> 11:44.875
Whoa.

11:45.375 --> 11:46.917
Jerry, check it out.

11:47.458 --> 11:50.583
He's got a first edition
Captain Ka-Boom comic book.

11:50.959 --> 11:52.083
Who's Captain Ka-Boom?

11:52.583 --> 11:56.125
Only the toughest, baddest superhero
there ever was.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.208
What's up with his funky utility belt?

11:58.542 --> 11:59.709
No, no, that's his fanny pack.

12:00.041 --> 12:03.166
It's where he keeps his super pixie dust
that he throws into villains' faces.

12:03.458 --> 12:05.917
After he does it, he just giggles
and skips away.

12:07.709 --> 12:08.709
Sounds awesome.

12:09.208 --> 12:11.208
You know, this comic's probably worth
a bunch of money.

12:11.291 --> 12:12.625
We should tell Harvey.

12:13.125 --> 12:14.083
Hey, Harvey.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.333
You know that box?

12:15.417 --> 12:16.458
I said throw it out.

12:16.542 --> 12:17.625
Yeah, but we found something--

12:17.709 --> 12:19.125
I said throw it out, you!

12:23.041 --> 12:25.000
Oh, look!

12:25.667 --> 12:28.125
He's got a Captain Ka-Boom action figure.

12:28.375 --> 12:30.750
Listen, when you pull the string,
he says his catchphrase.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.750
<i>That's it.
You're getting Ka-boomed!</i>

12:42.542 --> 12:43.959
As your official pit crew,

12:44.041 --> 12:46.750
Bobby and I are gonna make your kart
the best it can be.

12:47.083 --> 12:48.083
Come on, Bobby.

12:48.166 --> 12:49.625
Let's rotate the tires.

12:50.041 --> 12:53.208
The key to a good crew
is working together.

12:53.750 --> 12:57.792
Now, Milton and I,
we are a well-oiled machine.

12:57.875 --> 12:58.792
Done.

12:58.875 --> 12:59.834
Nice teamwork.

13:00.792 --> 13:03.917
So you're Team Wasabi's
new driver Cam, huh?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.625
Yeah, he sure is.

13:05.709 --> 13:07.375
That's my boy, cam.

13:07.458 --> 13:08.625
Main man.

13:09.125 --> 13:10.083
He's a guy.

13:10.792 --> 13:12.542
Well, at least this time, you got a dude.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.250
Before you, they had some blonde chick.

13:14.333 --> 13:15.375
I mean, what was she gonna do?

13:15.500 --> 13:16.834
- Ask for directions?
- Right.

13:16.917 --> 13:17.959
Oh, you are gonna--

13:18.041 --> 13:20.250
Uh, I'll tell you this
about that blonde chick.

13:20.375 --> 13:24.000
She was smart and pretty
and knew how to keep her cool.

13:29.250 --> 13:30.959
Whatever. I'm gonna win this thing.

13:31.041 --> 13:32.000
Come on, guys.

13:35.250 --> 13:37.041
Kim, you gotta relax.

13:37.125 --> 13:38.917
You can't let jerks like that get to you.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.125
Oh, he didn't.

13:40.667 --> 13:43.125
I just can't wait to get out there
and take his--

13:44.166 --> 13:46.000
- then I'm gonna--
-

13:46.083 --> 13:48.542
- until he--
-

13:49.542 --> 13:51.041
Now, let's go win this race.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.750
I thought it was best
you boys didn't hear all that.

13:58.083 --> 13:58.875
<i>♪ Hey! ♪</i>

13:59.083 --> 13:59.959
<i>♪ Come on! ♪</i>

14:00.417 --> 14:01.750
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

14:01.834 --> 14:04.250
I can't believe we got a thousand bucks
for that comic.

14:04.375 --> 14:06.417
I'm gonna use my money to buy a jet ski.

14:06.834 --> 14:08.959
I'm gonna look so cool
pulling up to school on it.

14:11.959 --> 14:14.000
I'll just take the rest of Harvey's junk
and throw it out.

14:15.917 --> 14:16.834
Huh.

14:18.750 --> 14:19.750
Look at this.

14:23.709 --> 14:25.166
My dog Ernie.

14:25.250 --> 14:27.500
The best friend a man ever had.

14:28.125 --> 14:29.333
Oh, look at Harvey.

14:29.750 --> 14:31.709
He's doing something
we've never seen him do.

14:32.834 --> 14:34.458
He's smiling.

14:34.792 --> 14:35.709
What?

14:35.750 --> 14:37.500
Well, this must be why he's so miserable.

14:37.583 --> 14:39.375
He lost the only friend he ever had.

14:41.667 --> 14:42.750
That's so sad.

14:44.125 --> 14:45.125
Are you crying?

14:46.041 --> 14:46.875
No.

14:47.542 --> 14:48.959
- Are you?
- No.

14:49.667 --> 14:51.625
Good. Then neither one of us are crying.

15:28.333 --> 15:29.917
Milton, she's not gonna make that turn.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.250
You'd better tell her to slow down.

15:31.667 --> 15:32.500
Kim Cam,

15:32.583 --> 15:34.625
you're coming in hot for a turn and burn.

15:34.709 --> 15:37.417
Don't clutch much.
Watch the throttle, baby needs a bottle.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.291
Gotta slow down the hoedown.

15:39.375 --> 15:40.333
- Give me that.
- What?

15:40.417 --> 15:42.291
Kim, you're going way too fast.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.583
I just said that.

15:44.166 --> 15:46.250
I'm pumping the brakes
but nothing's happening.

15:50.917 --> 15:53.083
She's going too fast.
She's gonna bounce off the wall.

15:53.166 --> 15:54.458
She's not gonna bounce off the wall.

15:55.583 --> 15:57.500
I just bounced off the wall!

16:01.959 --> 16:02.959
Whoa. Slow her down.

16:04.709 --> 16:06.750
Oh, no. Your brake line must be damaged.

16:06.834 --> 16:09.208
Oh, it's more than that.
The brakes are destroyed.

16:09.250 --> 16:10.458
Uh-oh. Is that bad?

16:10.959 --> 16:12.208
It means the race is over.

16:12.250 --> 16:13.375
Oh, did we win?

16:14.500 --> 16:16.500
No, it means Kim can't finish the race.

16:16.583 --> 16:17.417
What?

16:19.375 --> 16:20.834
You're not gonna want to hear this.

16:29.166 --> 16:32.041
It's not really working out with you
and the other genius.

16:32.834 --> 16:36.792
I don't like you, and I requested
a couple of new volunteers.

16:36.875 --> 16:39.959
You poor, lonely old man.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.750
Hey, what are you...

16:41.834 --> 16:44.250
What are you doing? Get off of me!

16:45.333 --> 16:47.250
Look, we know why
you are the way that you are.

16:47.375 --> 16:50.000
You haven't had a real friend
in a very long time.

16:56.125 --> 16:58.333
Harvey, this is your new friend, Casey.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.417
Oh. Look at you, boy.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.000
You're beautiful.

17:02.458 --> 17:03.875
Aw, thank you.

17:03.959 --> 17:04.959
But what about the dog?

17:05.500 --> 17:07.667
I was talking about the dog.

17:08.125 --> 17:10.959
Come to papa. Yeah, yeah.

17:11.959 --> 17:14.834
- Dude.
- Jerry, we did a good thing today.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.375
Hey, you know that feeling
you said I'd get from volunteering?

17:17.959 --> 17:19.250
I'm feeling it right here.

17:19.333 --> 17:20.709
-
<i>No, boy.</i>

17:20.792 --> 17:22.500
<i>No, that's my turkey sandwich.</i>

17:23.250 --> 17:24.583
<i>Why are you looking at me that way?</i>

17:25.542 --> 17:26.375
<i>Down, boy.</i>

17:27.500 --> 17:29.166
Uh, should we go in there and help?

17:32.250 --> 17:34.000
No. We should probably
just call someone for help.

17:34.083 --> 17:34.959
Good call.

17:37.375 --> 17:38.792
Kim, you have no brakes.

17:38.875 --> 17:39.875
You can't race.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.208
But I have to beat Tad.

17:41.250 --> 17:43.375
I'm sorry, but without brakes,
you'll just spin out.

17:43.959 --> 17:44.792
Wait, that's it.

17:45.792 --> 17:48.792
Guys, you know the game I play
at Falafel Phil's called Spin Out?

17:48.875 --> 17:51.667
Really? You think this is a good time
to brag about your high score?

17:51.750 --> 17:54.041
No, listen. Sometimes, in the game,
you lose your brakes

17:54.125 --> 17:55.250
and the only way to make a turn

17:55.333 --> 17:57.500
is by doing something
called the Daytona Drift.

17:57.583 --> 17:59.875
Oh, the Daytona-what-now?

18:00.375 --> 18:02.417
It's a racing move
where you slam on the gas

18:02.500 --> 18:04.333
and yank the steering wheel
away from the turn.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.375
Got it.

18:06.875 --> 18:08.959
No!

18:09.250 --> 18:10.208
Bobby, she'll be fine.

18:10.250 --> 18:11.208
Who cares?

18:11.250 --> 18:13.000
She just ran over all my piggies.

18:38.458 --> 18:39.291
All right, Kim.

18:39.375 --> 18:41.125
You're gaining ground,
but here comes the big turn.

18:41.625 --> 18:43.000
Jack, it's just a game.

18:43.083 --> 18:44.250
This is never gonna work.

18:44.333 --> 18:45.417
Well, you have a better idea?

18:47.834 --> 18:49.208
Start drifting, baby.

18:51.542 --> 18:53.250
Whoa. Ah, give me that.

18:57.750 --> 18:59.917
What happens in the game
if you can't drift?

19:00.000 --> 19:02.375
You slam into the wall
and your car explodes.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.250
Kim, you got this.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.750
-
- Yes!

19:30.041 --> 19:31.750
Kim, you did it. You were amazing.

19:32.792 --> 19:35.208
That was crazy. What were you thinking?

19:35.709 --> 19:36.834
- Whoa!
-

19:39.875 --> 19:40.792
Yes!

19:41.166 --> 19:44.041
That was some of the greatest driving
I have ever seen.

19:44.458 --> 19:45.709
Congratulations, son.

19:46.417 --> 19:47.667
Actually, uh...

19:49.834 --> 19:51.083
- I'm a girl.
-

19:52.500 --> 19:53.792
This dude's a girl?

19:53.875 --> 19:54.917
That's illegal.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.041
You know, so is removing
somebody's brake line.

19:57.125 --> 19:57.959
Tad.

19:58.041 --> 19:59.125
Who cares about her brakes?

19:59.250 --> 20:01.542
She shouldn't have been racing
which means I won.

20:01.625 --> 20:03.375
No, you lost. And you cheated.

20:03.875 --> 20:05.834
I'm suspending you from racing for a year.

20:06.583 --> 20:07.750
The trophy goes to Kim.

20:08.834 --> 20:10.709
From now on, you qualify, you race,

20:10.792 --> 20:13.333
whether you're a boy or a girl.

20:15.959 --> 20:17.667
The good news is I fixed the kart.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.166
I tightened up the brakes
so we'll be ready for the next race.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.208
Uh, but Bobby, you don't know
what you're doing.

20:22.250 --> 20:24.667
I certainly do!

20:29.166 --> 20:30.000
Oh.

20:30.083 --> 20:31.500
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

20:36.250 --> 20:37.291
How's Milton doing?

20:37.917 --> 20:39.083
I don't think he's gonna make it.

20:39.667 --> 20:41.917
Come on, Milton. You can do it.
You're almost there.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.208
Come on, come on.

20:46.458 --> 20:47.333
Oh!

20:48.166 --> 20:51.417
- I did it! I did it!
-

20:51.667 --> 20:53.208
I didn't fall off once.

20:53.583 --> 20:55.500
In your face, Donald.

20:57.125 --> 20:58.375
I'm going again.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.083
Whoa.

21:27.000 --> 21:27.875
<i>Poor soul.</i>

21:31.917 --> 21:32.792
<i>Yes!</i>
