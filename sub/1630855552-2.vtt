WEBVTT

00:46.793 --> 00:48.329
The fuck?

00:53.073 --> 00:55.611
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

01:01.857 --> 01:04.697
What? I don't speak--
what is that, Spanish?

01:04.697 --> 01:06.032
Fuck!

01:06.032 --> 01:08.470
Okay, this isn't real.
This isn't real.

01:08.470 --> 01:10.374
This isn't real.

01:10.374 --> 01:11.810
Oh, shit!

01:11.810 --> 01:13.146
Wha... I'm sorry?

01:13.146 --> 01:15.250
I-I...
Please, just leave me alone.

01:20.595 --> 01:22.398
I don't know
what you're saying, man.

01:22.398 --> 01:24.602
Like, no <i>espa√±ol</i>
or whatever the fuck.

01:32.585 --> 01:34.488
Go on, fucker!

01:36.861 --> 01:39.031
Go on! Shoo!

01:39.031 --> 01:40.868
Whoa. Whoa, whoa,

01:40.868 --> 01:43.139
- whoa, whoa.
- Oh, my God.

01:45.712 --> 01:48.884
So, we meet again,
you Spanish fuck.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.190
AW, fuck you.

01:53.527 --> 01:56.199
Hey. Right over that hill there

01:56.199 --> 01:58.403
is the lost city of gold.

01:58.403 --> 02:00.240
Yeah. Gold.
You like gold, huh?

02:00.240 --> 02:01.677
Go over there.
Indians'll give you

02:01.677 --> 02:03.380
all the gold you want,
don't even charge you.

02:03.380 --> 02:05.483
For free, just handing it out.

02:06.787 --> 02:08.725
You don't fucking
call me a fucking liar...

02:08.725 --> 02:11.095
Look, look.
Look at that. See that?

02:11.095 --> 02:12.899
Made of gold.
Solid gold.

02:12.899 --> 02:14.468
- It's a fucking dick medallion.
- Yeah,

02:14.468 --> 02:16.372
you want some?
Well, fuck you, man.

02:16.372 --> 02:19.445
Go get your own. Fuck you.

02:21.550 --> 02:24.956
What the fuck is going on, man?

02:24.956 --> 02:26.426
Aw, don't mind him.

02:26.426 --> 02:28.430
That fucking idiot
died out here.

02:28.430 --> 02:30.300
Comanches. Killed him.

02:30.300 --> 02:33.273
Never left this place, 'cause
his people didn't pray for him.

02:33.273 --> 02:35.177
Maybe we should pray for him. Yeah.

02:35.177 --> 02:36.613
Oh, Creator,

02:36.613 --> 02:38.383
take pity upon...
I'm just fucking with you.

02:38.383 --> 02:40.154
I'm not gonna pray
for a fucking colonizer.

02:40.154 --> 02:42.191
Am I seeing
more dead spirits, man?

02:42.191 --> 02:43.961
I don't want to see this shit.

02:43.961 --> 02:45.965
- I never asked for it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Bear cub.

02:45.965 --> 02:47.502
Chill down, man.

02:47.502 --> 02:50.240
Fucking take it easy.
This is a sacred place here.

02:50.240 --> 02:52.979
You're standing
on a spirit portal.

02:52.979 --> 02:55.685
Yeah. This is where
the spirits come and relax

02:55.685 --> 02:57.755
when they're not dealing
with little fuckers like you.

02:57.755 --> 02:59.659
We hang out. Yeah, I...
Fuckin', I just was hanging out

02:59.659 --> 03:01.863
with Genghis Khan back there.

03:01.863 --> 03:03.399
I said, "I like your hat,"

03:03.399 --> 03:04.903
and he had to give it to me
like that old way,

03:04.903 --> 03:06.406
that old Indian way.

03:06.406 --> 03:07.976
- Yeah.
- Stupid. It's fucking
stupid, man.

03:07.976 --> 03:09.211
Oh, fucking hold up, man.

03:09.211 --> 03:10.681
Coming, I...
I'm coming with you.

03:10.681 --> 03:12.886
[scoffs] Nice war paint.

03:12.886 --> 03:14.956
Oh, thank you.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.530
Can I have some water?

03:18.530 --> 03:21.402
Oh. Yeah, this is spirit water.

03:21.402 --> 03:24.642
You can't have some
until it's your time.

03:32.124 --> 03:34.329
For the Creator.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.403
But look on
the bright side, Bear.

03:38.403 --> 03:41.008
You made it.

03:41.977 --> 03:43.313
Made it where?

03:43.313 --> 03:45.785
Here. Exactly where
you're supposed to be.

03:45.785 --> 03:49.091
Grandson/Nephew, I did that.

03:49.091 --> 03:51.395
You're the reason I'm stranded
here in the first place.

03:51.395 --> 03:53.433
I know.

03:53.433 --> 03:56.038
It's because
this is your walkabout.

03:56.038 --> 03:57.474
Your inner journey.

03:57.474 --> 04:00.147
Can you please just
tell me what to do?

04:00.147 --> 04:01.984
Aw, you know I can't do that.

04:01.984 --> 04:04.789
I can only give you
cryptic aphorisms.

04:04.789 --> 04:06.894
I don't like it, either,
but I got to report

04:06.894 --> 04:08.631
to the spirit council.

04:08.631 --> 04:11.001
I'm gonna die in this desert.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.772
Can you just give me something?

04:12.772 --> 04:16.178
Give me an answer, man.
Like, just this once.

04:16.980 --> 04:18.951
Okay. All right,
all right, all right.

04:18.951 --> 04:21.222
Just one.

04:21.222 --> 04:23.627
Just keep walking.

04:24.963 --> 04:28.203
Fucking useless.
Like, of course I'm the one

04:28.203 --> 04:30.508
that gets a stupid
fucking spirit ghost

04:30.508 --> 04:32.411
and he turns out to know
absolutely nothing.

04:32.411 --> 04:33.847
Like, come on, man.

04:36.085 --> 04:39.759
This? This is nothing.

04:39.759 --> 04:41.429
Nothing.

04:41.429 --> 04:44.168
When I was a young man,
we would tie our chiefs

04:44.168 --> 04:46.039
to a piece of string
and then tie that to an arrow

04:46.039 --> 04:48.343
and then shoot that arrow
into the ground like that.

04:48.343 --> 04:49.913
As a show of strength

04:49.913 --> 04:52.619
to tell the enemy
that we're not gonna move.

04:52.619 --> 04:55.825
And then, sometimes
we'd cover our body in honey

04:55.825 --> 04:58.196
and blueberries
and-and eagle semen

04:58.196 --> 05:01.837
and just stand there for
the insect nation to take us.

05:01.837 --> 05:03.439
And the olders and the youngers
from the village would come

05:03.439 --> 05:05.945
and they would all feast on us.
It's a sad thing

05:05.945 --> 05:09.653
that we don't suffer for
the people like that no more.

05:09.653 --> 05:12.291
I don't care what you did
a hundred years ago.

05:12.291 --> 05:15.832
I need food and water now
or I'm gonna die.

05:15.832 --> 05:19.104
Hey, Grandson/Nephew,
your emotions here?

05:19.104 --> 05:21.142
Let's-let's bring it down
a little bit, you know?

05:21.142 --> 05:23.581
Let's take a breather,
just take five. You know?

05:23.581 --> 05:25.284
Just breathe in
and let it all out, man.

05:25.284 --> 05:28.022
No wonder you died
at Little Bighorn.

05:28.022 --> 05:31.128
Deep breaths?

05:31.128 --> 05:32.532
A gopher hole?

05:32.532 --> 05:34.569
No wonder why nobody
knows who you are.

05:34.569 --> 05:37.041
There ain't no songs about you.

05:37.041 --> 05:39.946
Look, look,
I-I know you're hangry,

05:39.946 --> 05:42.017
and you're probably close
to your man moon right now,

05:42.017 --> 05:44.354
but you don't mean this.

05:46.092 --> 05:47.529
I mean it.

05:47.529 --> 05:50.233
I don't want to talk to you.

05:50.233 --> 05:52.103
I never did.

05:52.103 --> 05:54.308
You just

05:54.308 --> 05:57.247
pushed your way into my life

05:57.247 --> 05:58.885
and you won't leave.

05:58.885 --> 06:01.590
You're like the opposite
of my dad.

06:01.590 --> 06:05.163
If you want me to go,
I-I can go.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.537
Fuck off, Spirit.

06:21.730 --> 06:24.001
Come on, let's go.

07:02.277 --> 07:04.716
Hello?

07:06.185 --> 07:08.156
Is anybody there?

07:08.156 --> 07:10.828
Here. Drink up.

07:11.496 --> 07:13.433
Go ahead, you can look.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.170
No funny business,

07:15.170 --> 07:18.276
or I'll cut off
your little <i>hushwa</i>

07:18.276 --> 07:21.415
and use it for catfish bait.

07:26.192 --> 07:29.097
Go on. Have some.

07:45.164 --> 07:46.766
Where am I?

07:46.766 --> 07:49.305
You're the youngest one
I've seen.

07:50.273 --> 07:53.079
And they didn't put
a tracking device on you.

07:53.079 --> 07:54.916
I know. I looked.

07:57.254 --> 07:58.557
Is it in your tooth?

07:59.324 --> 08:01.563
I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

08:01.563 --> 08:03.501
I just got lost
trying to get home.

08:03.501 --> 08:05.269
Oh, yeah?

08:07.609 --> 08:09.211
Where's home?

08:10.179 --> 08:11.215
Okern.

08:11.215 --> 08:15.557
Goddamn it!
Motherfuckers found me.

08:16.960 --> 08:17.762
Who?

08:17.762 --> 08:19.565
I used to live in Okern.

08:19.565 --> 08:21.402
You did?

08:21.402 --> 08:22.605
Oh, they're good.

08:22.605 --> 08:24.075
This is good.

08:24.075 --> 08:26.045
Oh, this is real good.

08:26.045 --> 08:28.049
- I'm trying to get
back to Okern, okay?
- They're getting good.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.285
If you want to--
you could just let me go...

08:29.285 --> 08:30.420
and I'll be on my way.

08:30.420 --> 08:32.959
And I got my eye on them, too.

08:32.959 --> 08:35.664
I've seen things
that you can't explain.

08:36.499 --> 08:41.442
Everything's connected.
Everything's connected.

08:48.122 --> 08:51.195
Yeah, I left that place.
Now here you are.

08:51.195 --> 08:54.435
That place came to me.

08:54.435 --> 08:56.540
See this?

08:56.540 --> 09:00.548
UFO sightings all over Oklahoma.

09:00.548 --> 09:02.183
27 in total.

09:02.183 --> 09:04.756
In that same week, there was
a spike in hospitalizations,

09:04.756 --> 09:06.960
mental institutions.

09:06.960 --> 09:11.703
The Sonics all over the state
ran out of Tots.

09:11.703 --> 09:14.909
They do not want the truth
to come out.

09:16.245 --> 09:18.817
I took this photo.

09:20.153 --> 09:23.727
Thing darted around in an oval.

09:23.727 --> 09:26.298
You know what it is?

09:26.298 --> 09:27.568
Photoshop?

09:27.568 --> 09:28.904
All right, who the hell

09:28.904 --> 09:30.574
were you really talking to
out there?

09:30.574 --> 09:31.944
Do you see things?

09:31.944 --> 09:34.482
Maybe them ones
with a mirror suit.

09:34.482 --> 09:36.619
I see a spirit sometimes.

09:36.619 --> 09:38.824
Oh?

09:39.926 --> 09:42.097
What kind of spirit?

09:42.865 --> 09:45.102
He died at the Battle
of Little Bighorn.

09:46.539 --> 09:47.909
Gah...

09:47.909 --> 09:49.846
What the hell would a spirit

09:49.846 --> 09:52.585
from Battle
of the Little Bighorn

09:52.585 --> 09:54.755
be doing here in Oklahoma?

09:57.026 --> 10:01.101
That just doesn't
make any sense.

10:03.741 --> 10:06.145
Can I use your bathroom?

10:06.145 --> 10:08.551
I piss outside.

10:08.551 --> 10:10.219
But if you're too dainty,

10:10.219 --> 10:13.192
you can use the one
down the hall.

10:13.192 --> 10:15.263
On the left.

10:17.802 --> 10:22.912
Thank you.

10:22.912 --> 10:26.018
Hey.
And don't flush.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.804
Fuck! Fuck!

10:44.121 --> 10:45.858
Fuck.

10:45.858 --> 10:49.364
Come on, man,
where you at, where you at?

10:55.544 --> 10:59.318
William Knifeman.
William Knifeman.

10:59.318 --> 11:01.255
William Knifeman?

11:06.733 --> 11:08.671
Why did I think
that was gonna work?

11:08.671 --> 11:10.240
God...

11:10.240 --> 11:11.843
Mm...

11:11.843 --> 11:14.816
You really got to stop
talking to yourself.

11:14.816 --> 11:17.354
People are gonna
think you're nuts.

11:17.354 --> 11:20.861
Follow me.

11:31.783 --> 11:33.152
And don't try to run.

11:33.152 --> 11:36.726
I got trip wires
all around the property.

11:36.726 --> 11:39.331
You're safe here.

11:39.331 --> 11:41.703
Safer than out there.

11:43.239 --> 11:44.642
What's your name?

11:44.642 --> 11:47.047
- Bear.
- Okay, Bear.

11:47.047 --> 11:49.017
Get in.

11:56.533 --> 11:59.271
‚ô™ ‚ô™

12:20.681 --> 12:23.152
Mm. There it is.

12:24.622 --> 12:26.158
Come on.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.819
What is all this?

12:57.588 --> 12:59.357
Eggplant.

13:00.126 --> 13:02.063
You must eat a lot of it.

13:02.063 --> 13:05.070
No, I won't eat it.

13:05.070 --> 13:07.541
It's Star People food.

13:07.541 --> 13:09.713
Came from up there.

13:09.713 --> 13:12.685
They call it Bongpipo.

13:12.685 --> 13:15.289
I don't know why they brought
all of this, but...

13:15.289 --> 13:18.863
I assume it's so they'll have
some food when they come back.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.536
Why do you grow so much of it?

13:22.437 --> 13:24.408
I told you.

13:24.408 --> 13:27.380
It's so I'll have something
to feed the Star People

13:27.380 --> 13:29.384
when they come back.

13:29.384 --> 13:30.855
It's an offering.

13:30.855 --> 13:34.394
People are only concerned
with things they can

13:34.394 --> 13:37.166
see and hear.

13:37.166 --> 13:40.674
But there are other
layers of life

13:40.674 --> 13:43.278
that can't be seen or spoken of.

13:44.281 --> 13:46.085
These need

13:46.085 --> 13:48.691
just as much attention

13:48.691 --> 13:50.259
and just as much care.

13:51.228 --> 13:55.170
So, have you actually
ever seen an alien before?

13:55.170 --> 13:56.940
Alien?

13:56.940 --> 13:58.877
Star Person.

13:58.877 --> 14:01.583
You probably have, too.

14:01.583 --> 14:02.952
See, they don't always appear

14:02.952 --> 14:06.291
the way people think they do.

14:07.829 --> 14:10.132
Sometimes they take
different forms.

14:11.335 --> 14:13.405
And, uh...

14:13.405 --> 14:15.443
sometimes they're, uh...

14:18.015 --> 14:20.086
...they're just a feeling.

14:20.921 --> 14:23.092
If you know what I mean.

14:24.862 --> 14:26.431
Yeah.

14:41.495 --> 14:43.933
This is where I get
my radio signals from.

14:45.571 --> 14:47.173
They talk to you?

14:56.793 --> 14:58.495
Sit.

15:03.606 --> 15:05.711
Oh, boy.

15:13.125 --> 15:15.329
What is this?

15:15.329 --> 15:16.700
Oh,

15:16.700 --> 15:18.369
having you here

15:18.369 --> 15:20.807
made me think
of these old times.

15:20.807 --> 15:22.745
Oh, that's me.

15:23.513 --> 15:26.151
I didn't always
live here, you know.

15:26.151 --> 15:27.855
Ah, there's Mabel.

15:27.855 --> 15:30.293
Are these your friends?

15:30.293 --> 15:32.598
Uh, more like, uh...

15:32.598 --> 15:34.636
more like family.

15:34.636 --> 15:36.438
That's Buchanan.

15:36.438 --> 15:38.309
He used to carry that
big ol' book of poetry

15:38.309 --> 15:40.915
around with him all the time.

15:40.915 --> 15:43.720
And sometimes
he'd read them to me,

15:43.720 --> 15:45.758
uh, Brownie...

15:45.758 --> 15:48.395
and Irene.

15:49.899 --> 15:52.003
Sometimes.

15:52.003 --> 15:54.040
It's...

15:54.040 --> 15:57.681
what's between the words
that's important.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.054
Where are they now?

16:03.861 --> 16:06.398
Where are your friends?

16:07.868 --> 16:09.505
On a bus headed back home.

16:10.473 --> 16:11.709
I missed it.

16:12.678 --> 16:14.682
Did you want to get left?

16:15.917 --> 16:17.287
I wanted to be alone.

16:17.287 --> 16:19.692
Did they not believe you?

16:20.493 --> 16:22.698
Did they take you and shock you?

16:23.733 --> 16:26.272
You know, when they
keep on not believing you,

16:26.272 --> 16:29.444
eventually,
they strap you to a bed

16:29.444 --> 16:33.152
and they put electricity
through your brain because

16:33.152 --> 16:35.624
they don't believe in what we

16:35.624 --> 16:37.628
"don't see or hear."

16:39.331 --> 16:41.503
Did they really shock you?

16:41.503 --> 16:42.972
Oh, yeah.

16:42.972 --> 16:44.542
Lots of times, over the years.

16:44.542 --> 16:48.015
Lot of psych wards
in Kansas, Texas,

16:48.015 --> 16:49.217
all over.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.722
I'm sorry that happened to you.

16:54.461 --> 16:56.464
But my friends believe me.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.470
They do.

16:59.470 --> 17:00.674
Oh?

17:00.674 --> 17:04.615
Well, then what's
your fucking problem?

17:18.744 --> 17:21.214
That reminds me of you.

17:34.207 --> 17:38.448
You're better off
looking up and around.

17:45.563 --> 17:48.469
Ah. Here, try it,
it's full of good minerals.

17:48.469 --> 17:50.875
I'm good. That's disgusting.

17:50.875 --> 17:52.678
You already drank it.

17:52.678 --> 17:54.080
What?

17:54.982 --> 17:56.484
That glass of water, uh,

17:56.484 --> 17:58.489
the coffee was made
with the well water.

17:58.489 --> 18:01.462
- Oh, my gosh, man...
- Oh, well, if your body's

18:01.462 --> 18:03.098
not used to it,
you could experience

18:03.098 --> 18:05.570
- some minor difficulties.
- Like what?

18:05.570 --> 18:09.110
Hell, it turned my tongue black
for a whole month.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.051
Ah.

18:13.051 --> 18:14.722
Take that.

18:14.722 --> 18:16.257
C'mon.

18:17.059 --> 18:18.696
Fuck!

18:21.301 --> 18:22.805
Do you have a phone charger?

18:23.573 --> 18:26.111
Yeah, it's right
next to my flying car.

18:26.111 --> 18:28.448
Now, what the hell would I be
doing with a phone charger?

18:28.448 --> 18:29.952
I don't even have a phone.

18:29.952 --> 18:32.157
Government tracks you that way.

18:34.061 --> 18:36.065
See this?

18:36.065 --> 18:38.704
Now, if anything happens,

18:38.704 --> 18:41.910
you come here. It'll take you
right to the highway.

18:41.910 --> 18:44.381
What do you mean,
if anything happens?

18:44.381 --> 18:48.455
Well, you never know. Do you?

18:50.627 --> 18:52.965
They got spiders in there?

18:52.965 --> 18:54.635
Nah, just snakes.

18:54.635 --> 18:57.574
- Couple of dead cats.
- Ew.

18:57.574 --> 18:59.043
Come on, let's go.

18:59.043 --> 19:01.448
Got something else to show you.

19:11.401 --> 19:13.305
Three quarters of UFO sightings

19:13.305 --> 19:15.777
occur between, uh,

19:15.777 --> 19:18.081
4:00 p.m. and midnight.

19:18.081 --> 19:21.222
They peak between...

19:21.222 --> 19:23.459
9:00 and 10:00.

19:23.459 --> 19:25.296
You think we'll see
something tonight?

19:25.296 --> 19:28.704
Well, in order to observe
the universe,

19:28.704 --> 19:31.108
you must put your back
to the future

19:31.108 --> 19:33.846
and fix your eyes on the past.

19:33.846 --> 19:36.986
Such is the way of nature.

19:37.821 --> 19:40.660
Celestial events
that had occurred long ago,

19:40.660 --> 19:42.396
we still see remnants of them.

19:42.396 --> 19:46.271
Hell, we might not know
what happened until

19:46.271 --> 19:48.844
the light travels
across the galaxy

19:48.844 --> 19:51.214
to show us.

19:52.250 --> 19:55.122
But the universe knows.

19:55.122 --> 19:56.391
It always knows.

19:56.391 --> 19:58.429
We are just

19:58.429 --> 20:00.767
echoes of things
that came before.

20:06.344 --> 20:08.750
Look.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.185
It's the Big Dipper.

20:10.185 --> 20:13.225
That's a boat.

20:13.225 --> 20:15.029
A boat?

20:15.029 --> 20:16.799
- I thought it
was supposed to be--
- Nah, white man

20:16.799 --> 20:19.605
calls it the Big Dipper.
It's a boat.

20:19.605 --> 20:22.978
Helps us on our journey
when we go.

20:22.978 --> 20:25.149
Where does it take us to?

20:25.149 --> 20:28.623
Well, they call it
the Milky Way.

20:28.623 --> 20:32.497
But it's a passageway
to the source.

20:32.497 --> 20:35.069
The source that
created everything.

20:35.069 --> 20:37.407
We are just, uh...

20:37.407 --> 20:39.377
energy manifest.

20:39.377 --> 20:41.649
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ You wouldn't know... ‚ô™</i>

20:41.649 --> 20:43.686
Why did they create us?

20:43.686 --> 20:46.291
Well, to prove a point, I guess.

20:47.059 --> 20:49.297
What kind?

20:50.432 --> 20:52.470
That we could still love.

20:52.470 --> 20:55.811
Through it all.
Life's tough.

20:55.811 --> 20:59.283
We should be proud
that we can still love.

21:01.121 --> 21:02.858
Do you still love?

21:04.394 --> 21:06.331
Yeah, I do.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.507
H-How do they know
that you love them?

21:10.507 --> 21:14.080
They-they don't.
They just feel it.

21:14.948 --> 21:18.088
See, y... love doesn't
have to be received,

21:18.088 --> 21:20.460
it can just, uh...

21:20.460 --> 21:22.463
it can just be.

21:22.463 --> 21:25.269
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ The distant horizons ‚ô™</i>

21:25.269 --> 21:27.675
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ Are a glorious sight... ‚ô™</i>

21:27.675 --> 21:29.210
Never seen the stars
this beautiful.

21:29.210 --> 21:30.647
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ And there's getting lost ‚ô™</i>

21:30.647 --> 21:34.755
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ In the Milky Way at night ‚ô™</i>

21:50.687 --> 21:53.893
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ I got a lightning lasso ‚ô™</i>

21:53.893 --> 21:58.201
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ And my trusty horse Blue ‚ô™</i>

21:58.970 --> 22:03.044
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ I've got
a six-shooter too... ‚ô™</i>

22:05.349 --> 22:08.188
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ I have an old Stetson hat... ‚ô™</i>

22:08.188 --> 22:10.293
You like spaghetti soup?

22:10.293 --> 22:11.662
Yeah.

22:11.662 --> 22:13.933
My grandma
used to make that for me.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.970
Yeah? Mine, too.

22:15.970 --> 22:17.406
Huh.

22:17.406 --> 22:19.177
Would you put the water
in the pot, please?

22:19.177 --> 22:20.413
Yeah, of course.

22:20.413 --> 22:23.251
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ Tumbleweed and buffalo ‚ô™</i>

22:23.251 --> 22:26.625
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ The rivers run wild. ‚ô™</i>

22:31.603 --> 22:33.439
How long have you been out here?

22:36.613 --> 22:40.486
On and off
most of my life, I think.

22:40.486 --> 22:42.958
This was my mom's house.

22:42.958 --> 22:46.231
She was from out this way.
My dad was from out your way.

22:46.231 --> 22:48.134
They still around?

22:49.605 --> 22:52.076
Now what the hell do you think?

22:52.076 --> 22:54.681
They died when I was a kid.

22:54.681 --> 22:57.052
Boarding school raised me.

22:58.523 --> 23:00.727
But, mostly, I've...

23:00.727 --> 23:02.797
been on my own ever since.

23:06.404 --> 23:07.974
I'm sorry.

23:08.943 --> 23:10.947
Don't be.

23:13.185 --> 23:14.988
You know...

23:14.988 --> 23:17.727
I don't like people.

23:18.529 --> 23:20.432
But you're all right.

23:21.368 --> 23:25.544
We're, uh,
kindred spirits, I think.

23:25.544 --> 23:27.380
We see things other people can't

23:27.380 --> 23:30.653
and, uh, people are...

23:30.653 --> 23:32.958
either afraid of it

23:32.958 --> 23:34.294
or they're jealous.

23:34.294 --> 23:36.899
Because it's powerful.

23:36.899 --> 23:38.135
So, uh...

23:38.135 --> 23:40.507
stay as long as you like.

23:40.507 --> 23:42.945
We can partner up on our powers,

23:42.945 --> 23:44.715
work the property,

23:44.715 --> 23:46.819
build up the signal.

23:46.819 --> 23:49.891
And get the eggplants ready.

23:49.891 --> 23:51.996
Eh.

23:58.342 --> 24:01.314
This is XM424987.

24:01.314 --> 24:03.318
Anyone receiving?

24:06.659 --> 24:09.631
This is XM424987.

24:09.631 --> 24:12.771
Anyone receiving?

24:17.914 --> 24:20.620
For fuck's sake,
is anybody receiving?

24:29.070 --> 24:30.740
Oh, shit.

24:30.740 --> 24:32.977
Get down, get down!

24:37.554 --> 24:39.825
They're here.

24:40.794 --> 24:42.363
You're gonna have to go.

24:42.363 --> 24:44.535
Who's here-- the Star People?

24:44.535 --> 24:47.073
There... there are no

24:47.073 --> 24:48.576
separate entities.

24:48.576 --> 24:51.949
There's only things
that rely on one another.

24:52.917 --> 24:54.822
Here.

24:54.822 --> 24:56.057
What?

24:59.598 --> 25:00.634
Fuck are the cops doing here?

25:00.634 --> 25:02.102
I-I'll tell them
nothing happened.

25:02.102 --> 25:04.407
- You didn't even touch me.
- Uh, n-n-- Just go home.

25:04.407 --> 25:06.277
Your people probably miss you.

25:07.981 --> 25:10.419
Maximus.

25:10.419 --> 25:12.089
What?

25:12.089 --> 25:13.859
I believe you.

25:15.162 --> 25:16.231
Good.

25:18.936 --> 25:20.807
Hello.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.482
I've been...

25:25.482 --> 25:27.521
I've been waiting for you.

25:27.521 --> 25:29.156
Here, take these.

25:29.156 --> 25:32.229
Come on, Maximus.
We'll take you back.

25:33.398 --> 25:36.338
I forgot to lock the door.

25:36.338 --> 25:37.941
It's okay.

26:31.582 --> 26:34.554
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ Early blue ‚ô™</i>

26:34.554 --> 26:36.525
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ I see you ‚ô™</i>

26:36.525 --> 26:39.063
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ Through my window ‚ô™</i>

26:42.737 --> 26:44.908
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ Becoming lighter ‚ô™</i>

26:44.908 --> 26:46.545
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ As the sun gets brighter ‚ô™</i>

26:46.545 --> 26:49.818
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ And the night goes away ‚ô™</i>

26:52.858 --> 26:55.564
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ I want to close my eyes ‚ô™</i>

26:55.564 --> 26:59.203
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ And pretend
it's night and quiet ‚ô™</i>

26:59.938 --> 27:02.176
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ So peaceful ‚ô™</i>

27:03.613 --> 27:07.119
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ But the rising sun
starts a day to run ‚ô™</i>

27:07.119 --> 27:10.358
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ Wherever it may go ‚ô™</i>

27:14.702 --> 27:17.807
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ Go run away... ‚ô™</i>

27:20.178 --> 27:22.684
Fuck.

27:40.954 --> 27:43.659
Okay, okay, we got this.

27:57.587 --> 28:01.260
Where the fuck are these dead
cats he's talking about?

28:06.772 --> 28:07.741
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ Go run away... ‚ô™</i>

28:07.741 --> 28:10.412
Yes, yes, yes, yes, fuck yes!

28:12.149 --> 28:13.318
Fuck off.

28:16.190 --> 28:18.629
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ In the morning's light ‚ô™</i>

28:18.629 --> 28:22.770
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ I try to hide from people ‚ô™</i>

28:26.645 --> 28:28.816
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ But it's never right ‚ô™</i>

28:28.816 --> 28:33.258
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ I see my friends at night
and it works out fine ‚ô™</i>

28:37.734 --> 28:41.007
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ Go run away ‚ô™</i>

28:43.044 --> 28:46.050
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ Go run away ‚ô™</i>

28:48.021 --> 28:50.893
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ Go run away ‚ô™</i>

28:50.893 --> 28:53.932
‚ô™<i>‚ô™ From my window. ‚ô™</i>
