WEBVTT

00:03.771 --> 00:05.473
Previously, on ER:

00:05.506 --> 00:07.608
I understand you want
to define yourself as chief...

00:07.641 --> 00:10.511
But?
Is this the way
you want to do it?

00:10.544 --> 00:11.745
I suck!

00:11.779 --> 00:13.281
Nah, you don't suck.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.583
You're...
you're still learning.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.351
LEWIS:
So, how are you doing?

00:17.385 --> 00:19.153
I've processed all of
my feelings of anger,

00:19.187 --> 00:20.821
shame and guilt in an
emotionally safe environment.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.523
I've addressed
the urge to use alcohol.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.158
Oh, and I've consulted both

00:24.192 --> 00:26.094
a shaman and a guru,
so really, I'm all good.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.761
I must've really made
an impression on you--

00:27.795 --> 00:30.131
you didn't even
notice I was gone for a week.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.532
Are you high?

00:38.806 --> 00:40.174
SAM:
Alex, hurry up!

00:40.208 --> 00:41.709
The bus is gonna
be here!

00:41.742 --> 00:43.344
What time do you start?

00:43.377 --> 00:44.845
Noon.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.214
Is Neela on today?

00:46.247 --> 00:47.215
Hmm?

00:47.248 --> 00:48.416
Is Neela on?

00:48.449 --> 00:49.583
I don't know.

00:49.617 --> 00:50.784
I think she is.

00:50.818 --> 00:54.088
Funny how that
keeps working out.

00:54.122 --> 00:54.855
What?

00:54.888 --> 00:56.424
Nothing.

00:56.457 --> 00:59.693
Come on, she's young,
single, lonely.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.329
She's got a crush on you.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.831
I'm her teacher,
she's just trying to learn.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.566
Yeah, I'll bet she is.

01:05.599 --> 01:06.634
Aw, come on.

01:06.667 --> 01:07.701
What, everyone
can see it.

01:07.735 --> 01:08.836
Who's everyone?

01:08.869 --> 01:11.139
Uh, Pratt, Frank,

01:11.172 --> 01:14.175
Jerry, Morris,
Chuny, Haleh.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.344
Even Murray.

01:16.377 --> 01:17.678
Murray?

01:17.711 --> 01:19.280
Yeah, the guy who works
at the roach coach.

01:19.313 --> 01:20.681
It's not
funny, Luka,

01:20.714 --> 01:22.250
and you're doing everything
to encourage it.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.518
Mm. That's not true.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.354
Yeah, well,
it better not be.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.756
Or else I'm going to have
to get into some...

01:28.789 --> 01:30.791
nasty chick fight
with Neela.

01:30.824 --> 01:34.162
In the mud?
Just don't hurt her.

01:34.162 --> 01:38.432
The only person who's going
to get hurt around here is you.

01:38.466 --> 01:39.600
You got it?

01:41.569 --> 01:43.437
Yeah, I think it was April.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.606
But the fact that I need
a calendar to figure it out

01:45.639 --> 01:46.840
is not a good sign.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.209
Did I meet him?

01:48.242 --> 01:50.211
No.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.513
He drove
a motorcycle.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.348
That was his defining
characteristic?

01:54.382 --> 01:55.383
I'm afraid so.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.185
What about you?

01:57.218 --> 02:00.754
Third year, my gross
anatomy instructor.

02:00.788 --> 02:01.922
He was very skilled

02:01.955 --> 02:03.691
at prossecting
the brachial plexus.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.826
You slept with
your instructor?

02:05.859 --> 02:09.197
Dr. Gibson had a very
tender way with cadavers.

02:09.197 --> 02:10.798
And you called
him "Dr. Gibson"?

02:10.830 --> 02:13.367
Only in bed.

02:13.401 --> 02:14.735
So basically,
neither one of us

02:14.768 --> 02:18.439
has got any in
a ridiculously long time.

02:18.472 --> 02:21.375
Well, at least we have work
to keep our minds off...

02:21.409 --> 02:24.578
Men. Romance. Sex.

02:24.612 --> 02:27.281
Yeah, at least
we have that.

02:27.315 --> 02:28.916
KOVAC:
Morning.

02:28.949 --> 02:29.950
Hello, Luka.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.420
Dr. Kovac.

02:32.453 --> 02:33.754
Uh, multiple MVA
on their way in.

02:35.223 --> 02:36.590
Patient satisfaction scores.

02:36.624 --> 02:39.593
We're up .6 points
from two weeks ago.

02:39.627 --> 02:40.661
Is that good?

02:40.694 --> 02:42.263
Yeah, it's good.
Very good.

02:42.296 --> 02:44.632
I'm going to post it.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.500
Um, Carter, I want
to thank you.

02:46.534 --> 02:49.303
I know that my taking over
as chief has been stressful,

02:49.337 --> 02:50.804
and it's been a little
weird for you,

02:50.838 --> 02:53.307
but you've made
the transition a lot easier

02:53.341 --> 02:54.442
and I really appreciate it.

02:54.475 --> 02:55.876
Susan, I can't think of anybody

02:55.909 --> 02:58.779
I'd rather
have as a boss than you.

02:58.812 --> 02:59.847
16-year-old driver

02:59.880 --> 03:01.849
backed into a utility pole.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.251
Okay, hop to.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.718
And don't call me Susan at work.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.287
What happened?

03:06.320 --> 03:08.289
Dad was teaching her
to parallel park.

03:08.322 --> 03:09.990
She just got her
learner's permit.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.592
I got a little bit dizzy.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.261
Maybe I got the pedals mixed up.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.262
CARTER:
Uh-huh.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.665
NEELA:
New scores?

03:17.698 --> 03:19.867
Yep, we don't suck
as bad as we used to.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.435
And maybe by next week
we'll suck a little less.

03:21.469 --> 03:22.970
Must be your
motivational speeches.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.672
We're pairing attendings
with interns.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.474
Abby, you got me.
Neela, you got Kovac.

03:26.507 --> 03:27.941
What?

03:27.975 --> 03:29.643
Yeah, big Croatian guy.
You can't miss him.

03:29.677 --> 03:32.280
We've got a double MVC
rolling in.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.414
Abby, he's all
yours today.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.316
Who?
Hey.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.585
You guys know each
other, right?

03:42.490 --> 03:44.325
Hi.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.926
You know how to clear
a c-spine clinically?

03:45.959 --> 03:48.028
Uh, you mean if it's not tender?

03:48.061 --> 03:49.363
That's a no.

03:49.397 --> 03:50.364
Check the Nexus criteria,

03:50.398 --> 03:51.599
get back
to me tomorrow.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.967
I give you Rodney Dixon
and Amanda Field.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.035
Rear-ended by a truck

03:55.068 --> 03:56.437
while having sex
in his car.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.405
Good vitals
on both.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.606
NEELA:
I'd say.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.308
They stuck together
with super glue?

04:00.308 --> 04:01.642
We tried to disengage
them at the scene, but...

04:01.675 --> 04:03.311
Oh, it's killing me, man.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.878
Broken pelvis plus
uncontrollable lust equals...

04:04.912 --> 04:06.414
( groaning )

04:08.000 --> 04:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:00.368 --> 05:01.402
NEELA:
Chest is clear, belly's benign.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.370
JAKE:
Backseat
of a car, huh?

05:02.403 --> 05:03.671
'66 Mustang Fastback.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.038
I hope it's not totaled.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.441
Fastback? That's
a pretty tight squeeze.

05:07.475 --> 05:08.976
I do Pilates.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.779
It's got a 389 to one rear
gear with a 31 spline axle.

05:11.812 --> 05:12.713
Nice.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.382
You were screwing in
the back of an old Ford?

05:14.415 --> 05:15.616
What were
we supposed to do?

05:15.649 --> 05:16.684
My husband was home.

05:16.717 --> 05:17.951
Oh, God!

05:17.985 --> 05:19.387
Probably a small crack
in the pelvis.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.921
You've got this, right?

05:20.954 --> 05:23.624
Oh, I'm all over it.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.825
We'll give
you some morphine

05:24.858 --> 05:27.127
and wait for
your Viagra to wear off.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.664
Dr. Lewis told me
to present to you today.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.400
She did?

05:32.400 --> 05:34.502
Something about interns having
a primary attending.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.004
Okay.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.672
I hope you'll show me

05:38.706 --> 05:40.107
that combat procedure
you mentioned last shift.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.942
The femoral tear?

05:41.975 --> 05:44.845
Oh, depends on, uh,
whether we get a patient

05:44.878 --> 05:47.080
who needs
emergent central access.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.416
Well, whenever we do.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.517
Uh...

05:49.550 --> 05:51.552
Sorry.

05:51.585 --> 05:54.755
Uh...

05:54.788 --> 05:57.157
Infected anal fissure,
parked in the hallway.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.492
Okay.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.831
Pupils four millimeters
and reactive.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.433
Ten centimeters JVD.

06:05.433 --> 06:06.767
My wife is not
gonna be happy.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.437
It's okay, Dad.
It was my idea.

06:09.437 --> 06:11.171
Take it Mom wasn't aware
of the driving lessons?

06:11.204 --> 06:14.808
If she had it her way, I'd never
be let out of the house.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.544
We're kind of separated for now.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.845
Katie was with me this week.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.113
She take any
medications?

06:20.147 --> 06:21.148
Prednisone,

06:21.181 --> 06:23.050
Tacrilomus...

06:23.083 --> 06:24.485
The anti-rejection drug?

06:24.518 --> 06:26.186
She had a kidney
transplant last year.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.456
I have polycystic
kidney disease.

06:28.456 --> 06:29.623
We were on
the UNOS list

06:29.657 --> 06:31.459
for seven years
waiting for a donor.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.461
I'm a big fan of dialysis.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.463
She's got blood
type O with an 80%

06:35.463 --> 06:37.130
reactive antibody panel.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.599
Tough match.

06:38.632 --> 06:39.833
Yeah, well, finally
got big enough

06:39.867 --> 06:42.135
that I could
give her one of mine.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.804
Your kidney?

06:43.837 --> 06:45.873
What a dad, huh?

06:45.906 --> 06:48.542
Any other meds?

06:48.576 --> 06:51.011
Uh, yeah, she's on an
anti-seizure drug, too.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.013
The PKD gave her
an aneurysm.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.615
Mom's on the way, sweetie.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.584
Thanks.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.552
Okay, a few crackles
at the base.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.590
Bradycardic at 48.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.958
Whoa, peaked T waves,
widened QRS.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.197
Amp of bicarb,
10 cc's of calcium gluconate.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.665
What do you think's going on?

07:11.699 --> 07:15.636
Um, well, low heart
rate, dizziness,

07:15.669 --> 07:19.206
and the EKG changes--
could be hyperkalemia.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.641
What?

07:20.674 --> 07:22.242
No, no, no, that
can't be that.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.777
KOVAC:
Hey, John?

07:23.811 --> 07:25.513
Since the transplant,
her kidney has been fine.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.247
Why don't we wait and see

07:27.280 --> 07:28.549
what the blood tests show and
then we'll take it from there.

07:28.582 --> 07:29.817
Excuse me
for one second.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.053
Do you need
an intern on this?

07:33.086 --> 07:34.788
I got Ray.

07:34.822 --> 07:37.157
Uh, what do you think about
taking Neela instead?

07:37.190 --> 07:38.792
Why, is there a problem?

07:38.826 --> 07:40.127
Just do me a favor, okay?

07:40.160 --> 07:41.562
All right.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.531
Send the Punjabi Powerhouse
my way.

07:43.564 --> 07:44.865
Painless jaundice
in Three

07:44.898 --> 07:46.066
and ulnar styloid
fracture.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.835
I'll take those.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.570
Uh, there was

07:49.603 --> 07:51.004
a little change--
you're with Carter today.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.606
I thought I was with you?

07:52.640 --> 07:53.907
No, he needs you in Trauma One.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.948
Isolated pubic
ramus fracture.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.550
Will I be, you know...
all right?

08:02.550 --> 08:05.586
No cast, no surgery,
just rest and pain meds.

08:05.619 --> 08:06.987
But you're going
to have to be careful

08:07.020 --> 08:08.889
for a couple of weeks
until it heals.

08:08.922 --> 08:09.890
Careful?

08:09.923 --> 08:12.560
Yes, as in "abstinent."

08:12.560 --> 08:14.962
The safest sex of all.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.830
Abstinent? Are you serious?

08:16.864 --> 08:18.198
You can't put any
pressure on your pelvis

08:18.231 --> 08:19.600
or you're going
to end up right back here,

08:19.633 --> 08:21.569
which is not
what we want to see.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.571
So it's the pelvis
we should worry about?

08:23.604 --> 08:24.605
That's right.

08:24.638 --> 08:25.973
But other positions...?

08:26.006 --> 08:27.240
Yeah, sure,
get yourself

08:27.274 --> 08:29.009
a six-pack,
a copy of the Kama Sutra

08:29.042 --> 08:31.311
and shoot out the lights.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.614
Did we do something
to offend her?

08:33.647 --> 08:36.583
Pulse is up to 61,
B.P.'s stable.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.652
Looks like the QRS
complexes are narrowing.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.654
That's good.
That is good.

08:40.688 --> 08:41.855
Lab says the chemistry
machine is down,

08:41.889 --> 08:43.691
it should be up in an hour.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.258
So you can't say yet
if it's a kidney problem?

08:45.292 --> 08:46.860
The urine dip shows
four plus protein,

08:46.894 --> 08:47.928
but we really
won't know anything

08:47.961 --> 08:48.962
until the labs
come back.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.598
I told them to hurry.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.700
Honey, are you okay?

08:52.733 --> 08:55.603
I'm fine, Mom.
It was nothing.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.705
I told you it was too
soon for her to drive.
What were you thinking?

08:57.738 --> 08:59.907
She's 16. She wants
a learner's permit.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.341
You never know when
to stop, do you?

09:01.374 --> 09:03.010
Mom, please.
Let's not do this here.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.845
I need more of Katie's
family history.

09:04.878 --> 09:08.315
Can we all step outside and
give Katie a chance to rest?

09:08.348 --> 09:10.618
I'll be back,
okay, sweetie?

09:15.889 --> 09:17.758
I've been sick for so long,

09:17.791 --> 09:20.728
it just got to be
too much for them.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.230
GABRIEL:
She was on dilantin
for a long time, but, uh,

09:23.263 --> 09:24.765
she didn't like it.

09:24.798 --> 09:25.899
It changed the way she looked.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.267
And she was still having these

09:27.300 --> 09:28.301
breakthrough seizures
once a month.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.970
It was manageable.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.706
No, honey, she had them
at school, in the movies...

09:32.740 --> 09:33.841
She hated it.

09:33.874 --> 09:36.109
So you switched her medication?

09:36.143 --> 09:37.911
Three months ago,
we put her on Zarictal.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.680
It was not my choice.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.181
Zarictal?

09:41.214 --> 09:42.950
Uh, it's new.
And we can't
afford it.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.351
Medicare does
not cover it.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.787
I took a second job
working night security

09:46.820 --> 09:47.921
over at the Maller's
Building.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.322
We lost
our apartment.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.824
She's been doing great.

09:50.858 --> 09:53.193
Katie has been seizure-free
for three months.

09:53.226 --> 09:56.029
No infections,
no febrile illnesses?

09:57.798 --> 10:00.000
Have they switched her
dosage of, uh, Zarictal?

10:00.033 --> 10:01.201
Everything's been steady.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.836
She was doing
fine before.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.004
I don't know why...

10:04.037 --> 10:06.206
She wanted to drive.

10:06.239 --> 10:08.075
Like other kids.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.677
And with the seizures
she couldn't get a license.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.278
We almost
lost her once,

10:11.311 --> 10:15.115
and you're worried about
her being able to drive?

10:16.984 --> 10:19.653
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.789
Look, I don't
want to fight, okay?

10:21.822 --> 10:23.691
I just think it's time
that we accept that fact

10:23.724 --> 10:25.358
that she will never
be totally healthy.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.160
Why? Why should I accept that?
Because that
is the reality.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.429
Not for me.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.264
( sighs )

10:35.002 --> 10:37.170
You have a neurologist?

10:37.204 --> 10:38.338
Yeah, he's been great.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.340
Good. Why don't we
give him a call?

10:40.373 --> 10:42.876
I'd like to talk to him
about the medications.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.247
Sounds like
a hard situation.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.750
I want you to look up this
new drug for me-- Zarictal.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.284
Oh, yeah, I had
a patient on that

10:51.318 --> 10:53.386
last year during my
Internal Medicine rotation.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.822
Really? I never
heard of it before.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.323
Well, it's pretty new.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.091
Expensive, but very
effective for seizure control.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.861
You kids and your
fancy book-learning.

11:00.894 --> 11:01.995
I try to keep up.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.731
Do a PDR and
check a medline.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.198
See if there's anything
about renal dysfunction

11:05.232 --> 11:06.900
associated with the drug.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.071
Hi.
Hi.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.741
This is
George Guidry.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.108
He's got a skin
breakdown

11:15.142 --> 11:18.211
around the shaft
of his penis.

11:18.245 --> 11:19.747
No he doesn't.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.982
I think I do.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.250
Any discharge?

11:23.283 --> 11:24.451
Oh, yeah, definitely.

11:24.484 --> 11:25.886
I'm not talking about that.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.420
No discharge, no fever,
no blisters.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.089
Do you use a condom?

11:29.122 --> 11:30.290
Not since my girlfriend

11:30.323 --> 11:32.092
broke up with me
a few months back.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.928
No vesicles, no chancre,
no lymphadenopathy.

11:34.962 --> 11:39.032
Okay.
Let's take a gander.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.001
You know, I just thought
of something.

11:41.034 --> 11:44.171
Could this be from too much...

11:44.204 --> 11:47.340
You know.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.441
Too much what?

11:50.911 --> 11:52.145
Since Lily left,

11:52.179 --> 11:55.015
I've been lonely,
you know?

11:55.048 --> 11:59.853
Really,
really lonely.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.121
How lonely?

12:01.154 --> 12:04.224
Oh, six, sometimes
seven times a day.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.400
I found a case report

12:13.433 --> 12:14.835
in the Western
Journal of Medicine.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.136
It suggests
a correlation between

12:16.169 --> 12:18.138
renal failure
and Zarictal.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.073
Mm, well, that ain't much.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.409
No, but these might be.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.144
From the Adverse Drug
Coordinator

12:24.177 --> 12:26.313
from the Department
of Health Services.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.448
Three more possible cases
they've forwarded to the FDA.

12:28.481 --> 12:31.018
Four, that could
be a pattern.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.385
The physician relations number

12:32.419 --> 12:34.487
at the Keating-Ward
Pharmaceuticals.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.056
They make Zarictal.

12:36.089 --> 12:39.292
Might as well see
what they can tell us.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.394
Yes.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.063
Hi, this is John Carter.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.833
I'm a physician at
County General in Chicago.

12:45.833 --> 12:46.900
Very well, thank you.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.068
I have
a 16-year-old girl,

12:48.101 --> 12:50.070
status post
renal transplant,

12:50.103 --> 12:53.340
who's been on Zarictal
for three months.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.142
Yes, and I was wondering
if I could talk to somebody

12:55.175 --> 12:58.078
about the incidence
of renal failure.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.147
Yes, I will hold.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.481
( muzak plays )

13:01.514 --> 13:03.083
Does anybody even
listen to that music?

13:03.116 --> 13:04.317
It's terrible.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.519
Carter, GRS is widening
on our PKD girl.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.055
Lots of ectopy.
I'll hold.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.593
Multifocal PVC's,
runs of six.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.028
Push 80 of lidocaine

13:15.062 --> 13:16.163
and mix up a drip
at one mig a minute.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.597
What's going on?

13:17.630 --> 13:19.066
It's possible that
the elevated potassium

13:19.099 --> 13:20.300
is irritating
Katie's heart.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.269
B.U.N. 98, creatinine 12.3,

13:22.302 --> 13:23.971
potassium 7.2.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.073
Sounds like she might
be in kidney failure.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.607
V fib.
Starting compressions.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.209
CARTER:
Okay, charge
the paddles to 200.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.378
She's all right.
It's going to be okay.

13:31.411 --> 13:32.913
I need
everybody clear.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.347
( gasps )

13:36.950 --> 13:37.951
Procainamide's on board.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.019
And clear.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.554
Sinus.
There we go.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.356
All right, set me up
for a femoral Quinton

13:43.390 --> 13:44.892
and call dialysis
for renal orders.

13:44.892 --> 13:46.626
Katie, honey.
Katie, honey.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.162
Yeah, she's responding.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.497
JARVIK:
O2 at 15 liters.

13:50.530 --> 13:51.899
Are you sure
she needs dialysis?

13:51.932 --> 13:53.266
CARTER:
It's the best way

13:53.300 --> 13:54.968
to remove the excess potassium
from her system.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.270
Does that mean she has
to have another transplant?

13:57.304 --> 13:59.606
CARTER:
Uh, that is a distinct
possibility, yes.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.541
Okay, betadine
in the area?

14:01.574 --> 14:03.376
NEELA:
They said they'd be
in contact within a week.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.244
CARTER:
And one per cent lido.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.946
A week?

14:05.979 --> 14:06.914
NEELA:
That's the
standard procedure.

14:06.947 --> 14:07.915
GABRIEL:
What's that?

14:07.915 --> 14:09.282
We telephoned the company

14:09.316 --> 14:10.550
that makes Katie's
seizure medication.

14:10.583 --> 14:11.584
So is it the drugs?

14:11.618 --> 14:13.220
Is that why this
is happening?

14:13.253 --> 14:14.487
The timing
of the med switch

14:14.521 --> 14:16.623
makes me think
it's a possibility, yes.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.058
HANNAH:
So, you mean her kidney's

14:18.091 --> 14:19.459
being damaged
by the Zarictal is it?

14:19.492 --> 14:21.094
Gabriel, Hannah...

14:21.128 --> 14:22.595
I came as soon as I heard.

14:22.629 --> 14:23.596
Is she in status?

14:23.630 --> 14:25.365
No, It's her kidney.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.034
This is Katie's
neurologist,
George Henry.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.238
Dr. Carter, I don't know
if you remember me...

14:31.271 --> 14:32.439
Yeah, how are you,
Henry?

14:32.472 --> 14:34.007
What has it been,
six years?

14:34.041 --> 14:35.642
Give or take.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.244
Can you take them
to the family room?

14:37.277 --> 14:38.445
I'll be right in
to see you in a sec.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.113
Oh, okay.
Yeah, that's fine.

14:40.147 --> 14:41.548
I think I remember the way.

14:41.581 --> 14:45.118
Come on,
it's all right.

14:45.152 --> 14:46.419
JAKE:
I gave pleasure boy

14:46.453 --> 14:48.956
some Neosporin,
the number for a therapist

14:48.989 --> 14:49.957
and sent him packing.

14:49.957 --> 14:51.024
Well done.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.025
How about you?

14:52.059 --> 14:53.160
Everything all right?

14:53.193 --> 14:55.562
Um, yes,
I'm fine. Busy.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.297
Why?

14:57.330 --> 14:59.566
Well, last week,
when I ran into you
on the El platform,

14:59.599 --> 15:02.202
I didn't realize
your situation.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.536
My situation?

15:03.570 --> 15:06.506
It's just that I...

15:06.539 --> 15:08.308
I heard what you
went through last week

15:08.341 --> 15:09.442
and I didn't want you to think
I was insensitive.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.278
Uh, no...

15:11.311 --> 15:15.115
I was happy not
to have to talk
about it actually.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.050
Okay. I guess I'm blowing
that now.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.519
I just...

15:19.552 --> 15:23.090
I want to make sure that there
isn't anything that I can do.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.692
Um, well, that's...
that's nice.

15:25.725 --> 15:29.062
It is. Thank you.
It's, um...

15:29.096 --> 15:31.731
Here's "H" and "P"
and get back to me.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.233
Right.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.669
Why did you put me
with this guy?

15:36.703 --> 15:38.571
When did everybody become
such schedule divas?

15:38.605 --> 15:40.040
Well, I don't need
a med student.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.308
I don't like them
very much

15:41.341 --> 15:42.409
and I'm just better
flying solo.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.044
Is there something wrong
with him?

15:44.077 --> 15:45.512
No, he's excellent.
He's-he's very good.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.713
He's excellent.
I just...

15:46.746 --> 15:48.648
Oh, no,
you like him, don't you?

15:48.681 --> 15:49.649
Okay, you know,
forget it.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.084
Oh, yes, you do,
you do!

15:51.118 --> 15:52.252
You're blushing.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.054
We never had
this conversation.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.156
Hey, haven't you had
enough of doctors?!

15:58.191 --> 16:00.093
Post a message on
the Neurology
and Renal news groups.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.328
Find out if anybody
else has anything

16:01.361 --> 16:02.462
on the drug's renal
toxicity.

16:02.495 --> 16:05.065
That could cause
a bit of a stir.

16:05.098 --> 16:07.334
Yeah... all right.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.302
Just ask
for any information

16:09.336 --> 16:11.204
that might help us best
determine the course
of treatment.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.705
HANNAH:
You heard what he said.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.141
I know. I don't
believe it's the drug.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.243
I think there are
other options...

16:16.276 --> 16:17.610
We have a dialysis tech
coming down

16:17.644 --> 16:19.512
and I called UNOS.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.114
They're going to put Katie
on the list for a new kidney.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.782
John,
that may be premature.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.484
Why don't we do
a biopsy?

16:24.517 --> 16:26.686
This may be a case of
rejection, not failure

16:26.719 --> 16:28.755
and a biopsy
would show us that.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.690
What's the difference?

16:30.723 --> 16:34.427
Well, a drug-induced
failure would require
a transplant.

16:34.461 --> 16:37.430
But, uh, rejection...

16:39.666 --> 16:43.770
Rejection could be reversed
with immunosuppressive agents.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.242
Well, let's do the biopsy.

16:49.276 --> 16:51.711
Okay, I'll put that in motion.

16:51.744 --> 16:54.747
Dr. Henry, can I have a word
with you outside, please?

16:54.781 --> 16:56.716
Excuse me
one second.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.321
Um...

17:01.354 --> 17:03.156
My intern's been doing
a little research.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.656
She's found four cases
of renal failure

17:04.691 --> 17:06.126
in patients on Zarictal.

17:06.159 --> 17:08.494
That doesn't
prove causation.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.530
No, but it gets you
going that way.

17:10.563 --> 17:13.333
Keating-Ward sponsored
a series of Phase Three
clinical trials.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.733
If there was any real risk,

17:14.767 --> 17:16.736
the FDA would never
have approved the drug.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.204
( chuckles )

17:18.238 --> 17:19.806
What, you never heard
of Vioxx or Rezulin?

17:19.839 --> 17:22.142
This is a very successful
anti-seizure medicine.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.743
It has improved Katie's
quality of life
dramatically.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.579
Dr. Carter,
dialysis is here.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.681
All right, will you page Dubenko
to come down for the biopsy?

17:28.715 --> 17:30.783
Sure. These need
your signature.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.286
Well, I hope you're right.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.587
Well, let's
be certain.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.123
You know, John,
I was really surprised

17:36.156 --> 17:37.357
to find you
still working here.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.325
Why is that?

17:38.358 --> 17:40.160
I don't know.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.862
I guess I thought
you would have
moved on by now.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.397
I guess I'm just a masochist

17:44.431 --> 17:45.465
that way.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.134
How about you?

17:47.134 --> 17:49.369
I thought you went
to go do, uh...
bench research.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.171
Yeah, well, I got tired
of it.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.739
You were good at it.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.708
I've got a wife and
two small children now.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.777
That changes
one's priorities.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.312
You mean money?

17:59.346 --> 18:01.214
Yeah, well, my practice
does offer me

18:01.248 --> 18:03.683
three times the salary
of an academic position.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.853
What about you,
huh?

18:06.886 --> 18:08.221
Married?

18:08.255 --> 18:09.822
Children?

18:09.856 --> 18:11.491
Not yet.

18:12.525 --> 18:13.626
Thanks.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.332
I'll find you when
the surgeon comes down.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.476
Are you moonlighting
as a word processor?

18:29.509 --> 18:31.178
Our PKD girl
is on a new drug,

18:31.178 --> 18:32.279
we're trying to get
information on.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.247
Hey, Sam.
Hey, Dr. Lewis.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.348
Morning.

18:35.382 --> 18:36.383
Hi.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.185
Has anyone seen...?

18:39.286 --> 18:41.488
Is that your coffee?

18:41.521 --> 18:43.256
Sorry.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.192
It's the nursing schedule,
not a cocktail napkin.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.260
BARDELLI:
GCS 12, B.P. 60
palp, brady at 52.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.528
KOVAC:
He fell from the roof?

18:48.561 --> 18:49.862
Taking down
his Christmas lights.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.264
He's gonna need
central access.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.599
Need some help?
Yeah, come on down.

18:52.632 --> 18:53.766
Carter doesn't
need you?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.935
Not at the moment, no.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.538
Okay, prime
the rapid infuser.

18:58.571 --> 18:59.806
Can't find a vein,
he's too clamped down.

18:59.839 --> 19:00.807
Pressure only 50.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.275
Heart rate's 42.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.510
Blood in the belly.

19:03.543 --> 19:04.944
He needs access.
He's about to arrest.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.779
Okay, set up for
a saphenous cutdown.

19:06.813 --> 19:10.417
Wouldn't a femoral
be easier to find?
And faster.

19:10.450 --> 19:11.551
It's probably
the same difference,

19:11.584 --> 19:13.553
but okay, femoral tear.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.222
Cool, I've never
done one before.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.323
You'll do the next one.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.790
Scalpel to Neela.
What?

19:17.824 --> 19:18.958
She's along
for the ride.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.227
I promised her.

19:20.227 --> 19:22.462
You promised her?

19:22.495 --> 19:24.464
Ten centimeters vertical slash.

19:25.698 --> 19:26.699
Starting here?

19:26.733 --> 19:27.934
Deep into the sub-Q.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.602
Level one is primed.

19:31.438 --> 19:33.473
Okay, and now you tear...

19:34.774 --> 19:35.908
Whoa.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.444
Got any sterile
surgical markers?

19:37.477 --> 19:38.945
There's the femoral vein.

19:38.978 --> 19:39.879
Cannulate it

19:39.912 --> 19:40.947
with the nine french.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.253
Let me try.

19:46.286 --> 19:46.986
No, I'll get it.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.621
Just reach under.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.862
Neela, focus on the field.

19:55.895 --> 19:56.896
Seldinger technique.

19:56.929 --> 19:57.897
You know what to do.

19:57.930 --> 20:01.234
Two units
ready to go.

20:01.268 --> 20:04.437
Sam, can you ask Dubenko to
come here when he's done?

20:04.471 --> 20:06.306
Yes, sir, Dr. Kovac.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.845
That's the lower lobe of
the kidney, right there.

20:12.879 --> 20:13.980
Mm-hmm,
mark the depth.

20:14.013 --> 20:14.981
Purple okay?

20:15.014 --> 20:16.349
It's my favorite color.

20:16.383 --> 20:17.350
Me, too.

20:17.384 --> 20:18.418
Three centimeters.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.852
They need you next door.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.454
What is this gonna do?

20:21.488 --> 20:23.856
It will tell us if your body
is rejecting the kidney.

20:23.890 --> 20:24.924
Lidocaine.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.626
That's a good thing, honey.

20:26.659 --> 20:27.727
All right, hold still.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.596
Little pinprick here.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.300
There you go.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.368
It would be, like,
20-something

20:35.402 --> 20:37.670
before I can get another one.

20:37.704 --> 20:38.971
No, that's not
gonna happen.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.407
Biopsy gun.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.041
You just need to tell
your immune system

20:42.074 --> 20:43.576
to stop being so picky.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.551
Firing.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.919
( muffled pop )
Dr. Carter,

20:52.952 --> 20:54.521
Dr. Weaver's on
the phone for you.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.589
She sounds kind of...

20:56.623 --> 20:57.590
Kind of what?

20:57.624 --> 20:59.058
Weaver-like.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.428
Um, I'll call her back.

21:01.461 --> 21:02.695
Purple, huh?

21:02.729 --> 21:05.365
I've always been partial
to azure myself.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.666
What's azure?

21:06.699 --> 21:08.668
Like your eyes.

21:08.701 --> 21:09.736
Send that off for
light microscopy,

21:09.769 --> 21:11.371
EM and IF staining.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.843
Pack the wound
with moist gauze.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.345
What do we have here?

21:18.378 --> 21:20.046
Belly bleed needs
a post-op head CT.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.381
And we have FFP thawing.

21:21.414 --> 21:22.949
Send it upstairs.

21:22.982 --> 21:25.418
Pressure's up to 100 systolic,
heart rate's 90.

21:28.788 --> 21:32.024
Dr. Kovac, I, uh...

21:32.058 --> 21:35.027
I never knew it was possible
to transfuse that fast.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.730
Well, that's the beauty of
the central venous cutdown.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.632
Now you know how to do it.

21:42.869 --> 21:44.437
So what made you
recommend Zarictal?

21:44.471 --> 21:46.506
I went to a luncheon
at Northwestern

21:46.539 --> 21:48.541
and I heard a
neurologist present
on the drug's efficacy.

21:48.575 --> 21:49.709
A neurologist
who was probably

21:49.742 --> 21:50.843
a paid consultant
of Keating-Ward.

21:50.877 --> 21:52.445
George.
So what?

21:52.479 --> 21:53.446
Dr. Carter.
It stopped
the seizures.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.014
Is everything all right?

21:55.047 --> 21:58.951
Um... if the biopsy doesn't
give us what we want,

21:58.985 --> 22:02.121
if she needs another kidney...

22:02.154 --> 22:05.124
could I give her my other one?

22:05.157 --> 22:07.059
That would require you
being on dialysis

22:07.093 --> 22:08.060
for the rest of your life.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.529
No, I understand that.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.063
I don't know
that it's even ethical

22:11.097 --> 22:14.401
for someone to donate
their only remaining kidney.

22:14.401 --> 22:17.437
So it's not possible?

22:17.470 --> 22:18.971
I just don't know
of any responsible doctor

22:19.005 --> 22:20.473
that would agree to do it.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.042
Gabe, listen, I...

22:23.075 --> 22:24.811
I know that you're scared.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.614
But let's just take this
one step at a time,

22:27.647 --> 22:28.515
okay?

22:28.548 --> 22:30.016
Okay.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.117
Why don't you go in there
and be with Katie.

22:31.150 --> 22:32.752
JARVIK:
Carter,

22:32.785 --> 22:35.522
some neurologist in Skokie
sent this fax for you.

22:35.555 --> 22:36.723
Thanks.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.695
It's a "Dear Doctor" letter
from the pharmaceutical company.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.697
It says that there have
been isolated cases

22:44.731 --> 22:45.832
of renal failure
on Zarictal.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.099
Yes, I know.

22:47.133 --> 22:48.568
And it recommends
monthly monitoring

22:48.601 --> 22:49.869
of renal function,

22:49.902 --> 22:51.571
which I've been doing
with Katie.

22:51.604 --> 22:53.172
BUN, creatinine.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.474
You got one of these?

22:54.507 --> 22:55.608
Yes, and so did you.

22:55.642 --> 22:56.843
Those letters
were sent out

22:56.876 --> 22:57.910
to every physician
in the country.

22:57.944 --> 22:58.978
They're sent as a caution.

22:59.011 --> 23:00.647
So you knew about this?

23:00.680 --> 23:01.848
Private practitioners
get letters like that

23:01.881 --> 23:03.115
all the time.

23:03.149 --> 23:04.684
I followed
it's recommendations.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.085
But you know what
the biopsy's going to show,

23:06.118 --> 23:07.687
'cause it says so
right here.

23:07.720 --> 23:08.988
Well, I'm hoping
that's not the case.

23:09.021 --> 23:10.690
Dr. Carter,
do you have a moment?

23:12.224 --> 23:13.960
Is there a problem?
No, Kerry, just...

23:13.993 --> 23:15.662
You posted a warning
about Zarictal

23:15.695 --> 23:17.897
on an Internet
message board?

23:19.666 --> 23:21.501
I posted a request
for some information.

23:21.534 --> 23:22.835
I'm getting a lot
of phone calls, John.

23:22.869 --> 23:24.136
I hate getting phone calls.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.205
Two neurologists,
our own head of nephrology,

23:26.238 --> 23:28.107
the regional director
from KW Pharmaceuticals.

23:28.140 --> 23:29.709
I'm just wanted to
be better informed
on a patient.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.578
By jumping to conclusions
based on skimpy evidence?

23:31.611 --> 23:33.513
Whoa. Tell it
to the Milners.

23:33.546 --> 23:34.847
They're gonna need
a new kidney for
their daughter.

23:34.881 --> 23:36.749
You have one sick girl,
that's unfortunate.

23:36.783 --> 23:37.884
The FDA and
the drug companies

23:37.917 --> 23:39.719
have access
to thousands of patients

23:39.752 --> 23:41.053
before they release
a drug to the public.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.589
They didn't use any
renal patients

23:42.622 --> 23:44.491
when they did
their clinical trial.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.058
They can't document
every side effect,
it's not feasible.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.694
You're working
beyond the limits
Are you telling me

23:47.727 --> 23:48.961
of your responsibility.
how to do my job?!

23:48.995 --> 23:49.996
Are you telling me
how to do my job?!

23:50.029 --> 23:51.664
I'm telling you,

23:51.698 --> 23:52.999
Please.
the FDA has an adverse
drug event division...

23:53.032 --> 23:55.101
Which is run by
political appointees...

23:55.134 --> 23:57.103
whose job it is to monitor
these kinds of things...
Please, please, please.

23:57.136 --> 23:58.671
funded by the
drug companies.

23:58.705 --> 24:00.106
...the number one
lobbyist in the country

24:00.139 --> 24:01.207
is the pharmaceutical
industry.
Come here.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.842
Come on.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.012
Pick up a bottle.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.514
Kerry...
Do it.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.018
Pravastatin.

24:12.051 --> 24:14.521
Saves millions from
heart attacks and strokes.

24:14.554 --> 24:15.788
Enoxaparin.
You know what this is?

24:15.822 --> 24:17.690
Yes, I do, it offers
better PE prohylaxis

24:17.724 --> 24:18.791
and allows DVT patients

24:18.825 --> 24:20.226
to be treated
at home.

24:20.259 --> 24:21.894
Linezolid.

24:21.928 --> 24:24.096
Fights off strains of MRSA
that used to be fatal.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.231
Kerry,
I think he gets it.

24:25.264 --> 24:26.833
Does he?
Yeah, he does.

24:26.866 --> 24:28.535
These drugs save lives.

24:28.568 --> 24:29.902
And the companies
that make them

24:29.936 --> 24:31.671
donate over
$20 million in grants

24:31.704 --> 24:33.105
to County's
academic programs.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.141
Without that, we wouldn't
have a hospital.

24:35.174 --> 24:36.275
We'd be standing in
a mini-mall right now.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.610
Oh, so that makes it okay

24:37.644 --> 24:39.178
to suppress
negative test results?

24:39.211 --> 24:40.847
Even at the risk of lives
like that little girl's?

24:40.880 --> 24:42.281
WEAVER:
Putting these
drugs out here

24:42.314 --> 24:44.216
and seeing how they
work is how we learn.

24:44.250 --> 24:45.885
It's how medicine advances.

24:45.918 --> 24:47.887
And that's not naive?

24:47.920 --> 24:50.790
Your job is to take care
of your patients,

24:50.823 --> 24:52.892
not start a crusade.

24:54.761 --> 24:55.928
Susan, you're the boss.

24:55.962 --> 24:57.564
Tell him to keep
his eye on the ball.

24:59.899 --> 25:02.902
No more computer access for you.

25:08.808 --> 25:10.643
It's like I forgot where I was.

25:10.677 --> 25:14.614
I was just looking at him
like he was a huge...

25:14.647 --> 25:15.915
cupcake.

25:15.948 --> 25:17.216
You want one?

25:17.249 --> 25:19.686
Ah, it's just
a metaphor, thanks.

25:19.719 --> 25:25.157
So you have a crush
on Luka?

25:25.191 --> 25:26.893
That's kinda weird.

25:26.926 --> 25:28.661
It's just a crush.

25:28.695 --> 25:31.631
Crushes are by nature
idealized, unrealistic...

25:31.664 --> 25:32.832
What about
Dr. Gibson?

25:32.865 --> 25:37.336
That sounded real,
gross, but real.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.005
My God, you're right.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.172
It's a pattern.

25:40.206 --> 25:41.608
I'm a slut
for authority.

25:41.608 --> 25:43.075
Stop it.

25:43.109 --> 25:44.010
Well, what about you?

25:44.043 --> 25:45.277
What about me?

25:45.311 --> 25:47.279
I heard you punched
your med student.

25:47.313 --> 25:51.651
So? He was bugging me.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.085
So you're hung up
on a subordinate.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.153
No, I'm not.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.622
I have a thing
for a supervisor.

25:55.622 --> 25:56.856
Oh, so what?

25:56.889 --> 25:58.958
I'm like the yin
to your yang?

25:58.991 --> 26:02.061
What are we gonna do?

26:02.094 --> 26:04.263
Ignore it and hope
it goes away.

26:04.296 --> 26:05.732
Right.
No need to discuss it.

26:05.765 --> 26:07.767
No. Denial works.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.205
Hey, Sam, dog bite in three.
I wrote for unasyn.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.674
Put it in the rack
and I'll get to it.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.042
Sam, did you check
on my biopsy results yet?

26:16.075 --> 26:17.910
Oh, yeah. Dubenko's
will be on his way down.

26:17.944 --> 26:19.145
What about my patient
in exam two?

26:19.178 --> 26:20.813
I'm waiting
on a repeat CBC.

26:20.847 --> 26:21.347
Sam?

26:21.380 --> 26:23.215
Done and sent.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.652
Nice seeing you all.

26:29.722 --> 26:32.659
Isometric vacuolization
of the renal tubular cells

26:32.659 --> 26:34.060
consistent
with drug toxicity.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.828
So there's no chance
that this is rejection?

26:35.862 --> 26:39.031
No tubulitis, no edema,
no inflammation.

26:39.065 --> 26:40.099
The girl needs
a new kidney.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.901
And it's from
the new drug?

26:41.934 --> 26:43.169
I'd say so, but, I, um,

26:43.202 --> 26:44.737
I don't want
to encourage you.

26:44.771 --> 26:46.105
Encourage me?

26:46.138 --> 26:47.740
Some of my
colleagues upstairs
were suggesting

26:47.774 --> 26:50.142
that you've been all over
the Internet with this.

26:50.176 --> 26:51.143
Just trying
to be thorough.

26:51.177 --> 26:52.411
Word of friendly advice?

26:52.444 --> 26:54.280
Don't piss off
the money people.

26:55.815 --> 26:58.084
Hi, everybody.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.252
Katie's biopsy results
and unfortunately,

27:00.286 --> 27:02.288
they are not
what we had hoped for.

27:05.792 --> 27:08.294
So it's not rejection?

27:10.062 --> 27:13.766
No. No,
it's irreversibly damaged.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.267
( sighs )

27:18.104 --> 27:21.340
And is this, is this
from the Zarictal?

27:21.373 --> 27:22.909
It could be from
the Tacrolimus

27:22.942 --> 27:23.943
she's been on
since the transplant.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.311
I doubt that.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.079
Her levels have been therapeutic
for two years.

27:30.216 --> 27:33.285
Wow. So, this, uh, this, uh,

27:33.319 --> 27:35.454
uh, drug that I've been working
two jobs to pay for

27:35.487 --> 27:38.090
just to make her life better

27:38.124 --> 27:41.027
has ruined
her donated kidney?

27:43.863 --> 27:45.965
I'm afraid so.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.066
You told me...

27:47.099 --> 27:49.035
You told us
it was working.

27:49.068 --> 27:51.938
Sometimes drug interaction
can only become apparent

27:51.971 --> 27:54.273
after the first year
or two of release.

27:54.306 --> 27:57.744
This couldn't have
been anticipated.

27:57.777 --> 28:00.412
So we're, we're back
to waiting?

28:00.446 --> 28:03.015
UNOS will prioritize
her for a new kidney.

28:03.049 --> 28:05.184
That'll take what, three, four
years, if we're lucky.

28:05.217 --> 28:06.886
Okay,
in the meantime,

28:06.919 --> 28:08.788
what I'd recommend is that
we get a surgeon down here

28:08.821 --> 28:10.823
to see her about creating
a forearm shunt

28:10.857 --> 28:12.458
to facilitate
dialysis access.

28:12.491 --> 28:14.393
We can take care
of that.

28:14.426 --> 28:16.195
So we're back
to where we started.

28:16.228 --> 28:18.898
She'll be on that dialysis
machine all through high school,

28:18.931 --> 28:20.466
through college?

28:20.499 --> 28:22.401
Well, just because it took
a while to get the kidney...

28:22.434 --> 28:23.803
No, It didn't take

28:23.836 --> 28:26.205
"a while."
There wasn't one.

28:26.238 --> 28:28.140
I gave her mine.

28:31.110 --> 28:33.212
( sniffles )

28:42.021 --> 28:43.222
We have given up a lot.

28:47.026 --> 28:48.460
Made a lot of sacrifices.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.997
( sobbing )

28:57.169 --> 29:01.908
You told me
this drug was worth it.

29:18.858 --> 29:19.859
Okay,

29:19.892 --> 29:22.294
uh, show me your incision.

29:22.328 --> 29:25.331
Fifth ICS, anterior
axillary line.

29:25.364 --> 29:26.398
Go for it.

29:30.202 --> 29:32.038
SAM:
Pulse ox is 92
on five liters.

29:36.208 --> 29:38.177
Push that in
just superior
to the rib.

29:42.481 --> 29:43.449
Okay,

29:43.482 --> 29:45.084
spread the clamp.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.518
Sats coming up.

29:48.587 --> 29:52.024
And slip your finger
into the pleural space.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.327
Uh, I lost the tract.

29:55.361 --> 29:58.164
Okay, keep your finger in there,
just guide the tube.

29:59.531 --> 30:01.968
I'm above the rib,
but it won't pass.

30:03.169 --> 30:05.304
There you go.

30:06.572 --> 30:07.874
Okay.

30:10.276 --> 30:12.211
That is where you
want to go.

30:12.244 --> 30:13.212
All right, I got it.

30:13.245 --> 30:14.914
Okay.

30:14.947 --> 30:16.582
Keep advancing.

30:16.615 --> 30:17.950
A little bit deeper,

30:17.984 --> 30:19.318
'cause you want
all the ports

30:19.351 --> 30:20.552
in the pleural space.

30:23.389 --> 30:24.590
Thoroseal's ready.

30:24.623 --> 30:25.591
So is suction.

30:25.624 --> 30:27.293
That's very good.

30:29.561 --> 30:31.163
Hello?

30:32.398 --> 30:36.302
Uh, okay, sew it in.

30:36.335 --> 30:37.369
( air pumping )

30:41.240 --> 30:43.175
Somebody put something
in the water today?

30:43.209 --> 30:47.046
Call it "pulseless
electrical activity
following trauma."

30:47.079 --> 30:48.214
Right.

30:48.247 --> 30:50.516
Change "blade"
into "scalpel."

30:50.549 --> 30:51.417
Don't say "torn."

30:51.450 --> 30:52.484
Say "dissected."

30:52.518 --> 30:54.653
Call it the
"field of exposure."

30:54.686 --> 30:56.555
You left out the size
of the cordis.

30:56.588 --> 30:58.224
Nine french.

30:58.257 --> 30:59.358
Okay, write it down.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.460
And not "blood."

31:01.493 --> 31:03.429
"Packed red cells."

31:03.462 --> 31:05.064
Okay, good job.

31:05.097 --> 31:07.133
Just make the changes
and I'll cosign.

31:07.166 --> 31:08.167
Okay.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.301
Hey, Neela,

31:11.971 --> 31:15.441
I hope I didn't give you
the wrong impression.

31:15.474 --> 31:17.443
You're a resident,
and I'm an attending.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.078
I mean, I want
to help you learn...

31:19.111 --> 31:20.346
Yeah, I-I got it.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.314
I understand. I'm sorry.

31:22.348 --> 31:23.983
It's just, I wouldn't want
anything to get in the way...

31:24.016 --> 31:26.152
I got it, I got it,
I got it. Thanks.

31:41.167 --> 31:42.468
Vitals are stable.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.103
I need to grab
an amp of bicarb.

31:44.136 --> 31:45.371
Okay.

31:47.506 --> 31:49.976
Katie's T-waves
are back to normal

31:50.009 --> 31:52.111
which means her
potassium has
come down.

31:52.144 --> 31:53.980
That's good.

31:54.646 --> 31:57.216
He went to work.

31:57.249 --> 31:58.517
Mr. Milner?

31:58.550 --> 32:00.619
Mm-hmm.

32:00.652 --> 32:04.390
He took
a second job

32:04.423 --> 32:08.460
as a security guard
over at the Jewelry Center

32:08.494 --> 32:13.465
just to try to help pay
for everything, you know?

32:15.767 --> 32:19.571
Nothing means more to him
than Katie getting well.

32:19.605 --> 32:22.374
Nothing.

32:22.408 --> 32:26.245
Her illness
just changed him.

32:26.278 --> 32:27.646
It ruined our marriage.

32:27.679 --> 32:29.648
It's important
to stay optimistic.

32:29.681 --> 32:31.383
( scoffs )

32:31.417 --> 32:34.386
A lot of good things
could still happen,
Mrs. Milner.

32:39.391 --> 32:42.228
MVC with passenger space
intrusion, ETA seven.

32:42.261 --> 32:43.262
Okay, we'll take it.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.296
What's MVC?

32:44.330 --> 32:45.564
"Motor Vehicle Collision."

32:45.597 --> 32:46.598
Another new protocol.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.234
No such thing as an accident.

32:48.267 --> 32:50.269
I liked "MVA."

32:50.302 --> 32:51.737
I like walks
in the springtime.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.472
John, a minute, please?

32:53.505 --> 32:55.041
I'll catch up to you.

32:55.074 --> 32:58.277
Um, I was aware
of the potential
for toxicity,

32:58.310 --> 32:59.478
but it was only one
case report

32:59.511 --> 33:01.047
in an obscure journal.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.714
Well, you could have
found out more than that

33:02.748 --> 33:04.216
doing a simple medline search.

33:04.250 --> 33:06.085
I can't do a medline
search every time

33:06.118 --> 33:08.054
I put a patient
on a new drug.

33:08.087 --> 33:09.655
Besides, I've got 20
patients on Zarictal.

33:09.688 --> 33:10.689
They're all doing well.

33:10.722 --> 33:12.124
20?!
Yes.

33:12.158 --> 33:14.060
What, are you on
the Keating-Ward payroll?

33:14.093 --> 33:16.528
Listen, as part
of an ongoing study,

33:16.562 --> 33:19.631
I send in a monthly update
on each patient's progress.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.233
And they compensate you?

33:21.267 --> 33:23.202
A small stipend
for my time.

33:23.235 --> 33:24.736
Oh-ho.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.572
Hope your medical
malpractice premiums
are paid in full.

33:26.605 --> 33:28.174
No, there's nothing
wrong with it.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.076
I am reimbursed
for helping to
monitor a new drug

33:30.109 --> 33:32.144
by doing thorough
patient evaluations.

33:32.178 --> 33:33.745
But the company will only
pay attention to it

33:33.779 --> 33:35.681
if it says exactly what
they want it to say.

33:35.714 --> 33:38.117
Her seizures stopped.
She was very happy.

33:38.150 --> 33:39.385
The father was thrilled.

33:39.418 --> 33:40.786
Yeah? He's real
thrilled now.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.754
Listen, I am trying to be
a cutting-edge clinician.

33:42.788 --> 33:44.090
Guys?

33:44.090 --> 33:45.657
That's what
the patients want.

33:45.691 --> 33:48.294
I have to offer them
the most efficacious
meds on the market.

33:48.327 --> 33:50.396
That problem is
that last part,
isn't it?

33:50.429 --> 33:52.098
Yo?

33:52.131 --> 33:53.565
What?

33:56.268 --> 33:57.569
( clears throat )

33:57.603 --> 33:58.737
Mr. Milner?

34:01.173 --> 34:04.143
Hey.
Hey.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.411
Uh... ( clears throat )

34:05.444 --> 34:07.413
I was...

34:10.282 --> 34:13.319
I was going to work
and I thought, "Why?"

34:13.351 --> 34:15.420
Whoa!
Whoa!

34:15.454 --> 34:17.123
What is the point now?

34:17.123 --> 34:20.659
Um, Gabe, p-put the gun away.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.663
I put everything
in your hands.

34:24.696 --> 34:25.664
Everything.

34:25.697 --> 34:28.800
And you let her down.

34:28.833 --> 34:32.404
Katie can still live a long,
productive life on dialysis.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.574
CARTER:
Okay, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

34:35.607 --> 34:36.708
Huh?

34:36.742 --> 34:37.576
Why, why, why shouldn't I?

34:37.609 --> 34:38.810
Why shouldn't I?

34:38.844 --> 34:40.279
You know what
we should do right now?

34:40.312 --> 34:42.148
Let's go inside and
see your family.

34:42.181 --> 34:43.181
Come on.

34:43.215 --> 34:44.382
Let's go inside

34:44.416 --> 34:45.851
and we'll see
your family right now.

34:49.721 --> 34:53.725
I want to give my kidney to her.

34:55.393 --> 34:56.594
Okay.

34:56.628 --> 34:58.397
Hey, maybe I was wrong
about that.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.167
Maybe you can be the donor.

35:01.167 --> 35:01.900
You're lying.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.502
I know you're lying.

35:07.473 --> 35:08.840
Fix her, okay?

35:08.874 --> 35:10.342
Yeah.

35:10.376 --> 35:11.677
For me.

35:11.710 --> 35:12.711
Yeah, we're gonna fix her.

35:16.382 --> 35:17.616
( all gasp )

35:17.649 --> 35:19.285
Sats are down to 88.
Can you see the cords?

35:21.553 --> 35:23.255
Lots of blood.

35:23.289 --> 35:24.590
All right, somebody
go find his wife.

35:24.623 --> 35:27.293
Okay, tube.

35:27.326 --> 35:28.594
And get that girl
out of here.

35:28.627 --> 35:31.263
Come on, let's move her
to another room.

35:31.297 --> 35:32.898
Grey matter covers
the occiput.

35:32.931 --> 35:34.266
Why the hell would
he do this?

35:34.300 --> 35:36.202
He was distraught.

35:36.202 --> 35:37.703
Pupils fixed
and dilated.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.871
Pressure's only 80/60.

35:39.905 --> 35:41.340
Start dopamine at 10 mikes.

35:41.373 --> 35:42.808
RASGOTRA:
No gag when I tubed him.

35:42.841 --> 35:44.210
DUBENKO:
No corneal reflex.

35:45.277 --> 35:46.578
Can he regain any function?

35:46.612 --> 35:48.247
No, he's as brain
dead as they come.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.248
I'll go talk to her.

35:49.281 --> 35:51.250
No, no, no,
wait, wait.

35:51.283 --> 35:52.718
Let me.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.486
I'm the family's doctor.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.858
Transplant
coordinator's down.

35:59.891 --> 36:01.560
( cries ):
No! No!

36:01.593 --> 36:02.894
I'm so sorry.

36:02.928 --> 36:04.763
No!
I'm very sorry.

36:04.796 --> 36:06.265
( crying )

36:09.968 --> 36:11.570
HERNANDEZ:
Technically,

36:11.603 --> 36:13.539
there's nobody else
who can give consent.

36:13.572 --> 36:15.941
The girl has a very rare
tissue type, Amparo.

36:15.974 --> 36:17.376
The father is a match.

36:17.409 --> 36:18.910
I've made that
clear to UNOS.

36:18.944 --> 36:21.513
Look, I'm trying to
get them to allow us
to proceed.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.749
For now, keep him on
an FIO2 of a hundred.

36:23.782 --> 36:24.950
And make sure
the girl's NPO

36:24.983 --> 36:26.518
in the hope that
she goes to the O.R.

36:26.552 --> 36:29.355
Just do everything
that you can, okay?
I will.

36:29.388 --> 36:31.257
WEAVER:
Go climb back under
your rock.

36:31.257 --> 36:32.658
Hey, I'm from the Trib.
It's a good paper.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.360
Yeah, right.
You guys endorsed Bush.

36:34.393 --> 36:36.362
Man, a guy shoots himself
in the ambulance bay.

36:36.395 --> 36:37.596
What's next, a plague of frogs?

36:37.629 --> 36:38.997
There's a small gang
of press outside.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.632
Someone from the ER
has to go talk to them,

36:40.666 --> 36:42.334
get them the hell
out of here.

36:42.368 --> 36:44.270
Well, obviously, the guy
was clinically depressed.

36:44.270 --> 36:46.272
All we know is he's
in critical condition.

36:46.272 --> 36:48.507
We can't go into
any details.

36:48.540 --> 36:49.708
( sighs )

36:49.741 --> 36:51.277
Heartfelt sympathy
to the family,

36:51.277 --> 36:52.478
we're doing
everything we can.

36:52.511 --> 36:54.646
You're good
with that, right?

36:54.680 --> 36:56.482
You want me
to talk to them?

36:56.515 --> 36:58.317
You treated
these people.

36:58.350 --> 36:59.885
Just play up the fact
that we're respecting

36:59.918 --> 37:01.920
the family's privacy,
okay?

37:01.953 --> 37:03.389
MAP's only 90.

37:03.422 --> 37:04.823
Can we go up
on the dopamine?

37:04.856 --> 37:07.859
We're maxed out.
I got a P.R.N. for levophed.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.595
Sounds good.

37:11.930 --> 37:14.366
Maybe we need to talk?

37:14.400 --> 37:16.335
Nah, we really don't.

37:17.903 --> 37:19.971
It's just, he helped
me to adjust

37:20.005 --> 37:21.340
coming back to work here.

37:21.373 --> 37:22.774
He made things
a lot easier.

37:22.808 --> 37:25.977
And I guess...

37:26.011 --> 37:30.349
I don't know,
I got confused.

37:30.382 --> 37:33.785
I get confused
every time I look at him.

37:36.555 --> 37:39.491
Did you work on this family?

37:39.525 --> 37:42.461
His daughter, yeah.

37:42.494 --> 37:44.396
I'm sorry.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.667
Levophed's going
at two mikes.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.035
REPORTER:
Does Gabriel Milner

37:50.068 --> 37:51.703
have a daughter being
treated in ER?

37:51.737 --> 37:53.572
( clears throat ):
Yes, he does.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.642
Now, is it true
that she's suffering
from kidney failure?

37:56.675 --> 37:58.344
Uh, I can't say.
REPORTER 2:
Didn't you indicate

37:58.377 --> 38:00.045
that earlier today
on a medical website?

38:00.078 --> 38:02.381
No, I made some general
informational queries...
Abby.

38:02.414 --> 38:03.882
that I can't discuss
the specifics.

38:03.915 --> 38:05.417
Hey.
Hi.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.522
Do you want to go get
something to eat?

38:10.556 --> 38:15.627
I know this awesome
little Ethiopian place.

38:15.661 --> 38:17.563
They make you eat
with your hands,

38:17.596 --> 38:22.434
but I got sterile gloves
in my bag so it's okay.

38:22.468 --> 38:23.702
Dinner...?

38:23.735 --> 38:25.671
Yeah.

38:25.704 --> 38:27.105
No.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.574
But don't take it
personally.

38:30.576 --> 38:32.644
( chuckling )

38:32.678 --> 38:34.546
Okay. Uh...

38:34.580 --> 38:36.615
I'm not really
a subtle guy.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.984
But I was under
the impression

38:39.017 --> 38:41.387
that there's sort of
a thing happening here.

38:41.387 --> 38:44.490
Maybe not a big thing,
but still... a thing.

38:44.523 --> 38:46.024
A thing?

38:46.057 --> 38:50.128
Um... Yeah, yeah,
maybe there's a thing.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.597
But you know what?
It's not...

38:51.630 --> 38:52.764
Nothing's gonna happen.

38:52.798 --> 38:54.466
Why is that?

38:54.500 --> 38:56.067
Well, a lot of reasons,

38:56.101 --> 38:58.470
most of which I won't mention
because I don't feel like

38:58.504 --> 39:00.005
sharing my checkered past
with you...

39:00.038 --> 39:00.972
Why?

39:01.006 --> 39:02.741
or my various neuroses.

39:02.774 --> 39:04.109
But there's one
really big reason

39:04.142 --> 39:06.978
that's a deal breaker
for me.

39:07.012 --> 39:08.880
You miss the beard?

39:08.914 --> 39:10.482
No.

39:10.516 --> 39:12.150
You're my student.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.520
Ah...

39:14.553 --> 39:16.688
I'm grading you.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.724
Uh-huh.

39:18.757 --> 39:21.092
Well, I think that that
is not appropriate.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.563
And have a good night.

39:26.698 --> 39:27.999
You know, um...

39:28.033 --> 39:32.904
what if I was willing
to take an "F" right now?

39:32.938 --> 39:34.940
I forgot to mention to you

39:34.973 --> 39:37.876
that I'm dropping out
of med school.

39:37.909 --> 39:41.580
Yeah, who wants to be
a doctor anyway?

39:43.048 --> 39:45.083
( chuckles )

39:45.116 --> 39:46.918
REPORTER:
Don't you think
it's incumbent upon you

39:46.952 --> 39:49.721
to share the information about
possible fatal side effects

39:49.755 --> 39:51.089
of a popular new drug?

39:54.059 --> 39:57.596
Katie Milner was on Zarictal
for the three months.

39:57.629 --> 39:59.665
And, yes, I believe the drug
ruined her kidney.

39:59.698 --> 40:02.968
"Out of respect for the family,
that's all I can say."

40:03.001 --> 40:04.436
Is that so hard?

40:04.470 --> 40:05.804
They knew it all
already anyway.

40:05.837 --> 40:07.105
No, they didn't.

40:07.138 --> 40:08.607
What you're alleging
is potential slander

40:08.640 --> 40:10.175
that could cost
the hospital millions

40:10.208 --> 40:11.543
in pharmaceutical
support.

40:11.577 --> 40:12.778
What, are you worried
about free pens

40:12.811 --> 40:14.713
and coffee cups
and drug samples?

40:14.746 --> 40:17.516
No, I'm worried
about research,
educational grants,

40:17.549 --> 40:19.618
a little thing that
HIPPA likes to call
"patient confidentiality."

40:19.651 --> 40:20.852
I didn't want to talk to
them in the first place!

40:20.886 --> 40:22.454
"Out of respect
for the family..."

40:22.488 --> 40:24.089
You want to talk to them
next time, then you do it.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.691
It's your damn ER.

40:25.724 --> 40:26.858
You're right.
I will.
Dr. Lewis?

40:26.892 --> 40:28.660
Dr. Weaver.

40:28.694 --> 40:31.229
Oh, I wonder what
she wants to talk
to me about.

40:31.262 --> 40:33.198
It's true, right?

40:33.231 --> 40:36.635
You did a good thing.

40:36.668 --> 40:37.936
( sighs heavily )

40:37.969 --> 40:39.605
You say that
like it matters.

40:41.507 --> 40:42.774
You ready to go?

40:42.808 --> 40:43.809
Yeah.

40:49.615 --> 40:51.182
UNOS gave us the go-ahead.

40:51.216 --> 40:52.684
We're gonna do
the transplant.

40:52.718 --> 40:53.852
Oh, thank God.

40:53.885 --> 40:55.621
They're bringing
Mr. Milner up.

40:55.654 --> 40:57.923
Look, she doesn't know where
the kidney's coming from.

40:57.956 --> 40:58.990
I haven't told her yet.

40:59.024 --> 41:00.626
That can wait.

41:00.659 --> 41:02.728
Let's go inside and talk
with the anesthesiologist.

41:10.602 --> 41:12.704
You a medical student?

41:12.738 --> 41:17.108
First-year resident.

41:17.142 --> 41:19.845
How's that going?

41:19.878 --> 41:23.849
Some days better than others.
I like it well enough.

41:26.885 --> 41:29.120
What do you think
they'll tell Katie?

41:29.154 --> 41:34.693
She'll tell her that
her father loved her.

41:34.726 --> 41:35.994
Maybe too much.

41:42.968 --> 41:45.571
The transplant surgery's
under way.

41:49.340 --> 41:53.645
I can't take responsibility
for how the system works.

41:53.679 --> 41:57.148
But I can try to do
my job better.

41:57.182 --> 41:59.284
That's all
any of us can do.

41:59.317 --> 42:01.086
I don't know why
I was surprised

42:01.119 --> 42:03.121
to find you here.

42:03.154 --> 42:05.190
Of course
you're still here.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.927
Hope we see
each other again

42:08.960 --> 42:11.029
under more favorable
circumstances.

42:11.062 --> 42:14.199
You were always good to me
when I was a student.

42:14.232 --> 42:15.934
I remember that.

42:29.214 --> 42:31.650
Anspaugh wants
to see us and Weaver

42:31.683 --> 42:33.752
in his office
tomorrow morning.

42:33.785 --> 42:35.186
Suture removal
in curtain three.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.355
Hey...

42:37.388 --> 42:41.893
if any of this rolls back
onto you, I'm sorry.

42:46.665 --> 42:47.899
Mr. Klossey.

42:47.933 --> 42:49.067
Hi, doc.

42:49.100 --> 42:50.802
How are you today?

42:50.836 --> 42:52.738
What are we looking
at here?

42:52.771 --> 42:55.641
I did this skiing
on Michigan Avenue.

42:55.674 --> 42:58.209
Cross-country,
during the last big snow.

42:58.243 --> 43:00.245
Little fall, gashed my arm,

43:00.278 --> 43:02.247
but I hadn't done it
in ten years,

43:02.280 --> 43:04.683
so even that felt good.

43:04.716 --> 43:05.851
Why'd you stop?

43:05.884 --> 43:08.654
Arthritis.
I had it bad.

43:08.654 --> 43:09.921
Couldn't bowl,

43:09.955 --> 43:12.190
couldn't sit in
those seats at Wrigley,

43:12.223 --> 43:14.259
take my niece for a walk.

43:14.292 --> 43:17.228
So what happened?

43:17.262 --> 43:20.265
I saw an ad on TV
for Renuvium.

43:20.298 --> 43:23.234
A doc at the clinic
gave me a prescription.

43:23.268 --> 43:25.403
Fixed me right up.

43:25.436 --> 43:26.972
Renuvium?

43:27.005 --> 43:29.775
Yeah. A little red pill,
once in the morning,

43:29.808 --> 43:31.176
let me do all those things

43:31.209 --> 43:33.779
I thought I had
given up forever.

43:33.812 --> 43:35.380
That's something, huh?

43:35.413 --> 43:37.015
Yeah.

43:37.048 --> 43:40.752
Okay, this might hurt
just a little bit.

43:40.786 --> 43:44.255
Damn miracle of medicine,
that's what it is.
