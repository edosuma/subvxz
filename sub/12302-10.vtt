WEBVTT

00:24.186 --> 00:25.907
No, no,

00:26.202 --> 00:27.640
Please

00:33.831 --> 00:35.166
No

00:37.221 --> 00:38.570
No

00:40.939 --> 00:42.390
Oh, my God.

00:44.663 --> 00:46.089
So, did he jump...

00:46.539 --> 00:47.907
or fall, Alexx?

00:48.304 --> 00:49.658
We got a woman across the street

00:49.659 --> 00:51.116
who saw it from her front walk.

00:51.354 --> 00:52.948
He may have dropped
from the third floor.

00:53.099 --> 00:54.303
But she wasn't sure.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.998
Apparently, she's nearsighted and

00:55.999 --> 00:57.431
didn't have her contacts in.

00:57.538 --> 00:58.818
Get an I.D.?

00:58.819 --> 01:00.476
Name is Michael Johnson.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.371
You think it's suicide?

01:03.263 --> 01:04.467
If it was...

01:04.468 --> 01:07.129
this briefcase didn't come
along. There's no damage on it.

01:07.164 --> 01:08.103
Alexx?

01:08.104 --> 01:09.760
In high falls, the tibias are often

01:09.795 --> 01:11.416
driven through the soles of the feet.

01:11.516 --> 01:13.007
His legs are intact.

01:13.355 --> 01:14.746
Minimal trauma to the head.

01:14.747 --> 01:16.336
And wouldn't the head sustain the most

01:16.337 --> 01:17.942
amount of trauma in a fall?

01:17.999 --> 01:20.711
Horatio, this guy's head
should be smashed to pieces.

01:21.059 --> 01:22.961
Looks like his shoulders and back

01:22.962 --> 01:24.410
took the major trauma.

01:24.439 --> 01:25.659
So, what are you saying?

01:25.694 --> 01:26.880
This man didn't fall.

01:26.881 --> 01:28.813
Someone fell on him.

01:30.012 --> 01:31.986
All right, so where's
the guy who crushed him?

01:32.071 --> 01:33.661
You don't fall three stories,

01:33.662 --> 01:35.182
get up and run away.

01:35.210 --> 01:36.559
You do...

01:36.857 --> 01:38.377
if you've got something to hide.

02:27.275 --> 02:29.561
Condo manager didn't
recognize our victim's name.

02:29.760 --> 02:32.373
Michael Johnson is not a resident.

02:32.473 --> 02:35.284
Okay, but she says the jumper
was from the third floor.

02:35.370 --> 02:36.719
Yeah.

02:37.780 --> 02:38.845
Or second.

02:38.860 --> 02:40.791
Yes, and we know she's got bad eyes.

02:41.700 --> 02:42.963
Let me know if you need anything.

02:42.964 --> 02:44.767
Thank you. Alexx, what else?

02:44.824 --> 02:46.273
Look at this, Horatio.

02:46.422 --> 02:47.798
Behind his right ear.

02:47.799 --> 02:48.645
See it?

02:48.680 --> 02:50.114
Looks like some kind of paint.

02:50.895 --> 02:53.551
So, maybe the jumper
transferred it to the victim.

02:59.917 --> 03:02.004
So then we're going to start up there.

03:02.416 --> 03:03.737
Thank you, Alexx.

03:05.321 --> 03:07.152
The tenant in 318 recently

03:07.153 --> 03:08.885
painted their balcony railing.

03:08.985 --> 03:10.334
He didn't. I did.

03:10.348 --> 03:12.151
Guy complained for a week straight.

03:12.265 --> 03:13.841
Said the salt air made it peel.

03:13.891 --> 03:15.552
Well, if we've got the same paint as

03:15.553 --> 03:17.584
on our victim, we've got a jump point.

03:17.740 --> 03:19.330
Or a crime scene.

03:19.572 --> 03:20.730
What's his name again?

03:20.765 --> 03:23.008
Edward Mathis He's a new tenant nice guy

03:23.115 --> 03:24.464
He's a little obsessive.

03:24.577 --> 03:25.621
Can I help you?

03:25.656 --> 03:26.665
Mr. Mathis?

03:27.020 --> 03:28.696
Officer Delko, this is Lieutenant Caine.

03:28.710 --> 03:30.072
Miami-Dade Crime Lab.

03:30.073 --> 03:30.777
Is something wrong?

03:30.812 --> 03:33.425
Mr. Mathis, it appears that
somebody was either pushed

03:33.460 --> 03:34.900
or leapt from your balcony.

03:34.929 --> 03:35.651
You're kidding?

03:35.686 --> 03:36.462
No.

03:37.627 --> 03:38.749
Here, come in.

03:38.784 --> 03:39.871
Thank you.

03:44.105 --> 03:45.426
Paint's still tacky.

03:45.454 --> 03:47.499
Looks like we've got
evidence of activity.

03:47.940 --> 03:49.388
Looks like he fell from here.

03:51.767 --> 03:53.158
Can I see your arms and

03:53.159 --> 03:54.820
the bottom of your shoes, please?

03:55.062 --> 03:56.823
Wait a second. You don't
think I pushed the guy?

03:56.894 --> 03:58.285
Could I see them, please?

03:58.314 --> 03:59.677
Yeah.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.105
We good?

04:07.140 --> 04:07.950
You live here by yourself?

04:07.985 --> 04:08.851
That's right.

04:08.886 --> 04:09.718
Anything missing?

04:09.901 --> 04:11.249
Uh, I don't think so. Place looks

04:11.250 --> 04:12.656
exactly like I left it.

04:12.684 --> 04:15.013
I noticed that somebody's
broken into your desk here.

04:16.675 --> 04:18.052
Son of a...

04:18.152 --> 04:19.471
It was right here.

04:19.515 --> 04:20.594
What's missing?

04:20.629 --> 04:22.447
My ring, my grandmother's ring.

04:22.475 --> 04:24.790
It was a family heirloom,
one of a kind, you know.

04:24.904 --> 04:26.253
Worth almost

04:26.423 --> 04:27.744
100 grand.

04:28.014 --> 04:30.500
We'll do everything we can
to get it back, Mr. Mathis.

04:31.756 --> 04:33.233
My mom's gonna freak.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.434
And my fiancee...

04:35.448 --> 04:37.394
I can't believe I left
the sliding door unlocked.

04:38.047 --> 04:39.779
Look, it's normal. It's the altitude.

04:39.814 --> 04:41.093
It makes people feel safe.

04:41.206 --> 04:42.626
They think burglars can't reach them.

04:42.641 --> 04:44.046
Yeah, well, how did the guy get up here?

04:47.781 --> 04:49.173
I don't think he came up.

04:50.089 --> 04:51.424
I think he came down.

05:02.290 --> 05:03.653
Sir?

05:03.717 --> 05:05.151
Step away from the edge, please.

05:12.714 --> 05:15.099
Turn around, and put
your hands in the air.

05:15.426 --> 05:16.747
Sir?!

05:18.195 --> 05:20.553
Sir, hold it right there!
There's nowhere to go!

05:21.270 --> 05:24.224
Put your hands in the air.
Turn around slowly, right now.

05:24.578 --> 05:25.353
Do it!

05:25.388 --> 05:26.780
They're up.

05:26.974 --> 05:27.782
See 'em?

05:27.817 --> 05:28.637
I see 'em.

05:28.672 --> 05:29.457
They're up.

05:29.492 --> 05:31.381
Walk towards me slowly, right now.

05:31.440 --> 05:32.746
I was just up checking out the view.

05:32.803 --> 05:34.507
Let's go. That wall. Right now.

05:36.012 --> 05:38.072
Up against that wall.
Let me see those hands.

05:38.682 --> 05:39.989
Right now.

05:41.586 --> 05:42.950
It's my side.

05:46.358 --> 05:47.821
That was a mistake.

05:47.863 --> 05:49.638
You understand me? That was a mistake.

05:49.738 --> 05:51.087
Get off me! H.!

05:52.486 --> 05:53.850
Hook him up.

05:54.418 --> 05:56.008
Got something in his pocket, Eric.

05:56.761 --> 05:58.138
That's a carabiner.

06:03.935 --> 06:06.136
Guns, knives, needles?

06:13.877 --> 06:16.021
What's this? This yours?

06:17.129 --> 06:18.591
Eric, bring him over here.

06:22.787 --> 06:25.130
Somebody used this to rappel
down to the third floor

06:25.131 --> 06:26.721
balcony. I want to know who it is.

06:33.558 --> 06:36.213
I don't know. I was just
smoking some weed, man.

06:36.214 --> 06:38.316
Okay, how do you explain
your possession of this?

06:38.997 --> 06:39.772
I found it.

06:39.807 --> 06:41.171
Yeah, I find that hard to believe.

06:41.206 --> 06:42.725
What about the weed? You find that, too?

06:42.754 --> 06:45.168
What about it? Weed's
a misdemeanor, anyway.

06:46.091 --> 06:48.377
So why don't you just write
me a ticket, cut me loose, huh?

06:48.392 --> 06:50.011
We're going to charge this man for

06:50.032 --> 06:51.878
possession, and that's
just for starters.

06:52.134 --> 06:53.483
Take him.

07:01.030 --> 07:02.521
This is the guy from the sidewalk?

07:02.734 --> 07:04.907
Yeah. He's Michael Johnson.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.378
Wife identified him
just a few minutes ago.

07:07.769 --> 07:09.061
Anything besides the paint?

07:09.075 --> 07:11.333
Significant spinal compression.

07:11.603 --> 07:14.301
He's three inches shorter
now than when he was alive.

07:15.267 --> 07:16.616
Is this a laceration?

07:16.651 --> 07:17.597
Yeah,

07:17.632 --> 07:19.223
wound angle's straight down.

07:19.592 --> 07:20.913
Came from above.

07:21.069 --> 07:23.270
It looks like the jumper cut
him with something curved.

07:27.495 --> 07:28.816
Good news is,

07:28.958 --> 07:30.264
you have its shape.

07:30.633 --> 07:32.124
I'll know when I see it.

07:34.794 --> 07:36.271
So, this guy came in with the ring?

07:36.690 --> 07:38.038
You had to park in the front?

07:38.039 --> 07:39.700
I told you to come around the alley.

07:39.814 --> 07:41.305
The alley was blocked.

07:41.958 --> 07:44.089
Could you put your badges
away? I have clients.

07:44.103 --> 07:45.764
Uh, no, we can't.

07:45.821 --> 07:47.156
Where's the suspect?

07:47.924 --> 07:49.572
Security's holding him over here.

07:49.657 --> 07:51.049
Please make this brief.

08:05.274 --> 08:06.680
Edward.

08:07.177 --> 08:08.569
I see you found your ring.

08:08.649 --> 08:10.039
Man, am I glad to see you. You have to

08:10.040 --> 08:11.787
tell these people that ring is mine.

08:11.872 --> 08:13.831
Oh, you lied in a murder investigation.

08:13.832 --> 08:15.565
I don't have to do anything.

08:15.593 --> 08:17.112
Oh, come on. The ring is mine. I can sell

08:17.113 --> 08:18.930
it to an auction house if I want to.

08:19.198 --> 08:20.746
That's an old one, Edward.

08:20.774 --> 08:22.876
Claim something's stolen.
Collect the insurance.

08:22.890 --> 08:25.532
Go out and sell it. Make twice the cash.

08:25.915 --> 08:27.322
It's called fraud.

08:27.911 --> 08:30.183
All right, fine, guilty.

08:30.495 --> 08:32.369
I'm sorry. So what is that? A fine?

08:32.370 --> 08:33.946
Two days in jail? What?

08:33.975 --> 08:35.764
Depends on how involved you are.

08:35.977 --> 08:38.035
What was inside the broken file cabinet?

08:38.520 --> 08:39.884
I told you, nothing.

08:39.927 --> 08:42.014
Why would a thief break into
your house and not take anything?

08:44.528 --> 08:45.891
He was after something else.

08:46.033 --> 08:47.035
What is it?

08:47.070 --> 08:49.086
I guess you'll have to
find the thief and ask him.

08:49.125 --> 08:51.780
All right. You can come
with us until we do.

08:54.379 --> 08:55.814
Hey, you. Got a minute?

08:56.438 --> 08:57.341
Always.

08:57.376 --> 08:59.989
Got wind of a case over in
civil you need to know about

09:00.170 --> 09:01.262
Doug Ramsey?

09:01.263 --> 09:02.641
I arrested him this morning.

09:02.655 --> 09:04.004
On a rooftop, right.

09:04.061 --> 09:05.836
Yeah. So, the story is travelling.

09:05.864 --> 09:08.676
He's filing a lawsuit, Horatio,
against you and the department.

09:08.939 --> 09:10.828
Assault, excessive use of force.

09:10.842 --> 09:13.540
Excessive use of force? The
man tried to take my head off.

09:13.981 --> 09:16.181
Well, his lawyer claims
he has a shoulder injury.

09:16.182 --> 09:17.374
Doctor backs it up.

09:17.375 --> 09:19.576
I don't care what his attorney says.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.920
I know what happened.

09:20.921 --> 09:22.355
Look, I believe you.

09:22.966 --> 09:25.167
I'm just suggesting
you lay low for awhile,

09:25.202 --> 09:26.502
see how this plays out.

09:26.537 --> 09:27.603
I can't do that.

09:28.242 --> 09:29.577
Horatio,

09:29.733 --> 09:31.622
police brutality is serious business.

09:31.750 --> 09:33.084
And so is murder.

09:38.333 --> 09:39.697
Eric Delko been in?

09:39.732 --> 09:41.103
He's...

09:41.529 --> 09:42.764
working.

09:42.778 --> 09:44.298
Well, I need to interview him on this

09:44.348 --> 09:46.947
Doug Ramsey matter. Police
brutality charge against you...

09:46.982 --> 09:48.126
What, are you waiting
by the phone, Rick?

09:48.410 --> 09:49.816
Delko's an eyewitness.

09:49.851 --> 09:50.969
I got questions.

09:51.004 --> 09:52.327
Fair enough, but

09:52.362 --> 09:53.650
make it quick.

09:53.671 --> 09:54.914
Eric

09:54.949 --> 09:56.341
has a real job.

09:58.713 --> 10:00.090
We'll see if you do.

10:07.229 --> 10:08.649
Started on the winch yet?

10:08.691 --> 10:11.176
Actually, I need to clarify casing.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.008
The lab request indicates I need to

10:13.043 --> 10:14.726
swab this for epithelials

10:14.741 --> 10:17.013
Okay, well, you can
start with the cable.

10:18.655 --> 10:21.525
There's gotta be about 20
feet of line wound up in here.

10:21.893 --> 10:24.492
Well, I'm guessing that our
suspect didn't use gloves.

10:30.549 --> 10:32.707
You gonna get Horatio
to sign my overtime slip?

10:32.721 --> 10:34.058
Done.

10:34.752 --> 10:36.059
I'm late for a meeting.

10:41.626 --> 10:44.295
...and Lieutenant Caine
went to investigate the roof.

10:44.494 --> 10:45.801
What time was that?

10:46.667 --> 10:48.030
Approximately 0800.

10:48.591 --> 10:50.479
Okay, when did you get on the roof?

10:51.033 --> 10:52.837
Approximately five to ten minutes after.

10:53.930 --> 10:55.862
Which was it? Was it five or ten?

10:56.387 --> 10:57.736
Remember, you're under oath here.

11:00.222 --> 11:01.515
Ten.

11:01.983 --> 11:03.389
What did you see?

11:04.113 --> 11:06.868
I saw Lieutenant Caine
restraining a suspect

11:07.138 --> 11:09.055
that I now know to be Doug Ramsey.

11:10.494 --> 11:11.943
Well, according to the
victim's statement...

11:11.978 --> 11:13.420
Suspect's statement.

11:13.973 --> 11:15.876
According to the suspect's statement...

11:18.028 --> 11:19.462
According to the

11:19.718 --> 11:21.323
subject's statement,

11:21.820 --> 11:24.731
Lieutenant Caine, without
provocation, assaulted him,

11:24.986 --> 11:26.762
causing him severe bodily injury.

11:27.736 --> 11:29.355
That's BS, and you know it.

11:29.383 --> 11:30.718
BS?

11:31.755 --> 11:33.985
He had Ramsey under
control when I arrived.

11:34.588 --> 11:36.839
So, you did not witness the actions

11:36.874 --> 11:39.942
that resulted in Mr. Ramsey
having a dislocated shoulder?

11:40.524 --> 11:42.441
I didn't see him do
anything to his shoulder.

11:43.102 --> 11:44.849
So, he assaulted Ramsey
before you got there.

11:45.189 --> 11:46.823
There was no assault

11:47.462 --> 11:49.237
on the part of Lieutenant Caine.

11:49.251 --> 11:50.756
As far as you know.

11:50.771 --> 11:52.333
Yes, as far as I know.

11:57.601 --> 11:59.007
He's trained you well.

11:59.774 --> 12:01.137
Trained me to tell the truth.

12:36.347 --> 12:38.392
Valera, have you got
anything on the winch cable?

12:38.406 --> 12:40.934
I just ran the guy Horatio
found on the rooftop.

12:41.019 --> 12:42.411
No match.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.144
What about CODIS?

12:44.179 --> 12:45.401
Just getting there.

12:46.679 --> 12:48.866
Stanley Hemming. He's
got quite a resume.

12:49.576 --> 12:51.138
Three arrests for burglary.

12:51.230 --> 12:53.118
Two convictions. Electronics,

12:53.153 --> 12:54.624
jewellery, artwork.

12:54.652 --> 12:56.811
Looks like Stanley's your Pink Panther.

12:56.868 --> 12:58.870
Looks like he might also be our killer.

12:59.126 --> 13:00.617
I told you.

13:01.958 --> 13:03.989
I don't do rooftops anymore.

13:04.159 --> 13:05.466
Those days are behind me.

13:05.693 --> 13:07.880
Then why did we find your skin cells

13:07.894 --> 13:10.450
on this winch cable at Coastline Condos?

13:10.813 --> 13:13.326
Now, that thing's been missing
from my garage for months.

13:14.107 --> 13:15.769
When P.D. pulled you
out of Dade Memorial,

13:15.804 --> 13:17.487
you were having your ankle checked.

13:17.658 --> 13:18.822
Yes, I

13:18.836 --> 13:20.782
fell on my front doorstep this morning.

13:22.392 --> 13:23.784
Do you have any aspirin?

13:24.224 --> 13:26.298
The doctor says you have
a comminuted fracture.

13:26.553 --> 13:27.860
It's a crushed bone.

13:27.902 --> 13:30.586
Takes a higher fall than your
front step to shatter a bone,

13:30.629 --> 13:31.936
Stan.

13:32.914 --> 13:34.263
Do you know Michael Johnson?

13:35.271 --> 13:36.549
No.

13:37.018 --> 13:37.835
Not good with names.

13:37.870 --> 13:40.781
He's the guy you landed on when you
fell out of a third floor balcony.

13:52.356 --> 13:53.890
What were you trying to steal up there?

13:55.040 --> 13:56.141
Was it worth it?

13:56.176 --> 13:57.951
This is absurd. I'm not saying anything

13:57.965 --> 13:59.741
until my lawyer gets here.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.800
That's fine. We have a warrant

14:01.835 --> 14:03.164
to search

14:03.199 --> 14:05.457
your home, your car, your person.

14:05.570 --> 14:07.331
You can empty your pockets
yourself or we can have

14:07.366 --> 14:09.291
an officer help you.
It's entirely up to you.

14:27.130 --> 14:28.550
It's a glass cutter.

14:32.448 --> 14:33.436
Suction cup.

14:33.471 --> 14:35.047
So no more rooftops, huh?

14:35.587 --> 14:37.092
I install windows for a living.

14:37.234 --> 14:38.583
Sure you do.

14:38.668 --> 14:40.060
How about the other pocket?

15:07.839 --> 15:09.146
Blood.

15:09.373 --> 15:10.970
The man you fell on you also cut

15:11.005 --> 15:12.568
him with something circular.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.886
So this is what all the fuss is about.

15:25.051 --> 15:26.400
DNA just paged me.

15:26.414 --> 15:28.672
Blood on the DVD case
matches our victim.

15:29.183 --> 15:30.583
Puts cat burglar Stan on the roof and

15:30.618 --> 15:32.606
the sidewalk. That's one
charge of manslaughter.

15:33.064 --> 15:34.803
Well, let's see if the disk itself

15:34.838 --> 15:36.543
has anything on it worth stealing.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.135
Oh, yeah.

15:39.170 --> 15:40.519
You like that?

15:40.554 --> 15:41.698
Oh, yeah.

15:42.586 --> 15:44.659
Oh, baby...I could do
this all night long.

15:44.801 --> 15:46.150
Wait the guy zoom in on him.

15:50.482 --> 15:52.172
That's Judge Isaac Greenhill.

15:52.454 --> 15:53.687
Who?

15:53.722 --> 15:56.093
He's a criminal judge. Department Six.

15:56.150 --> 15:57.293
Tough old guy.

15:57.328 --> 15:58.188
Not that tough.

15:58.223 --> 16:00.197
Those handcuffs are made of feathers.

16:00.694 --> 16:02.952
I got a feeling this is
something he doesn't want out.

16:03.809 --> 16:05.513
This is a criminal court
judge we're talking about.

16:05.548 --> 16:06.961
Are we sure about this?

16:06.996 --> 16:07.729
Yes.

16:07.743 --> 16:09.688
Ryan showed me the whole thing. It’s him.

16:09.958 --> 16:11.563
And I just spoke with Yelina. The guy who

16:11.577 --> 16:13.352
owns the condo, Edward Mathis?

16:13.430 --> 16:16.029
Up until six weeks ago, he was
a clerk for Judge Greenhill.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.727
And a clerk's job is to keep
the judge's secrets, right?

16:19.565 --> 16:21.880
So when Mathis left, he
could've taken the DVD

16:21.915 --> 16:23.847
along with the plants, his pictures.

16:24.202 --> 16:25.622
He's been blackmailing his boss.

16:25.650 --> 16:27.724
Till somebody stole it from his condo.

16:27.937 --> 16:29.243
Thank you.

16:30.372 --> 16:32.204
That's why you're the Chief Judge.

16:36.635 --> 16:37.941
Judge Greenhill...

16:39.204 --> 16:40.525
Lieutenant Caine.

16:40.738 --> 16:42.016
Could we have a minute, please?

16:42.051 --> 16:43.138
Yeah, sure.

16:43.152 --> 16:44.182
Rain check on lunch?

16:44.217 --> 16:46.177
Once more, and I demote you.

16:46.944 --> 16:48.293
Please, come on in.

16:51.805 --> 16:54.602
You're looking at two consenting adults.

16:55.184 --> 16:57.428
Been seeing a dominatrix, Judge?

16:57.897 --> 16:59.771
What do you mean, like
some kind of a sicko?

17:00.063 --> 17:02.051
She's a fun girl who
does what I ask her.

17:04.309 --> 17:05.616
How did you get this?

17:05.701 --> 17:07.858
It was stolen from a condo today.

17:08.030 --> 17:10.203
A condo owned by your former clerk,

17:10.411 --> 17:11.817
Edward Mathis.

17:11.887 --> 17:13.194
I did some digging.

17:13.237 --> 17:14.905
Found two cash deposits in

17:14.940 --> 17:16.574
Edward's bank accounts.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.108
Significant sums

17:19.088 --> 17:20.479
with no names attached.

17:20.487 --> 17:22.092
Was he blackmailing you, Judge?

17:22.858 --> 17:24.279
Edward wanted to change careers.

17:24.292 --> 17:26.153
I loaned him money
to make that possible.

17:26.977 --> 17:29.064
Your Honor, Stanley Hemmings

17:29.115 --> 17:30.762
we believe that you paid him

17:31.586 --> 17:33.190
to steal back the DVD.

17:33.743 --> 17:34.590
Who?

17:34.625 --> 17:36.968
A criminal judge has his choice of, uh,

17:37.678 --> 17:39.070
qualified thieves.

17:39.279 --> 17:41.949
Yes, he does, and we
believe that you paid Stanley

17:42.474 --> 17:44.775
to steal back the DVD
with this young lady on it.

17:44.803 --> 17:46.635
The problem is, Your Honor...

17:47.218 --> 17:49.206
is somebody got killed in the process.

17:49.255 --> 17:50.569
And that's felony murder.

17:50.604 --> 17:53.260
We need the name and address of
this young lady on the screen.

17:54.041 --> 17:55.816
Well, I wish I could give it you,

17:56.782 --> 17:59.040
but, uh, her name escapes me right now.

17:59.378 --> 18:01.679
It's not going to escape me.

18:06.550 --> 18:08.623
Slap and tickle on a Saturday afternoon.

18:09.340 --> 18:11.044
Whatever happened to lunch at Tantra?

18:11.640 --> 18:13.756
Saturday? You know
when this was recorded?

18:14.183 --> 18:16.327
Yeah, time and date
are encoded in the disc.

18:22.179 --> 18:23.713
October 30,

18:23.741 --> 18:25.517
2004 is the date.

18:25.914 --> 18:28.911
1:16 p.m. is the time of
the last recorded frame.

18:29.585 --> 18:30.891
Got when.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.149
What about where?

18:33.448 --> 18:34.797
Working on it.

18:37.183 --> 18:39.781
This still from the video
may have elements we can use.

18:40.149 --> 18:42.223
You're right. Window
behind him is unobscured.

18:42.563 --> 18:44.246
The camera exposure's set for indoor.

18:44.281 --> 18:45.929
Everything outside is bleached out.

18:45.964 --> 18:47.321
Can you adjust it?

18:52.108 --> 18:53.422
The blinds are in the way.

18:53.457 --> 18:54.892
I can't make out what
those structures are.

18:54.927 --> 18:56.326
Tyler, push in on that building.

19:00.309 --> 19:02.496
That's a reflection
of the Sagamore Hotel.

19:02.667 --> 19:05.465
Yeah, based on that building's angle,

19:06.473 --> 19:08.433
the Sagamore should be

19:08.660 --> 19:09.924
north of this sex party.

19:09.945 --> 19:11.522
Okay, let's triangulate that.

19:19.907 --> 19:21.426
Her name is Donna Scott.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.946
She's a nice girl. Private.

19:23.713 --> 19:25.559
I think she was doing more than yoga.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.391
All male clients?

19:27.959 --> 19:29.337
Look, she

19:29.346 --> 19:30.788
always pays her rent on time. That's

19:30.823 --> 19:32.485
more than I can say
for a lot of my tenants

19:32.527 --> 19:33.947
I haven't seen her for about a month.

19:34.373 --> 19:36.191
Glad I collect first and last.

19:36.518 --> 19:38.620
No woman leaves town
without her purse and keys.

19:38.733 --> 19:40.054
Not willingly.

19:41.061 --> 19:43.461
Can you tell me exactly
the last time you saw her?

19:44.313 --> 19:45.747
It's important.

19:46.045 --> 19:47.891
Last Saturday in October.

19:48.019 --> 19:49.951
The Miami-North Carolina game.

19:50.149 --> 19:51.533
Big upset.

19:51.568 --> 19:53.073
She locked herself out.

19:53.280 --> 19:55.808
That's around the time
that DVD was recorded.

19:56.070 --> 19:57.519
Yeah, same day.

19:59.550 --> 20:00.927
Hold on.

20:01.737 --> 20:03.086
Do you hear that?

20:06.601 --> 20:08.674
I'm gonna need you to
wait outside, please.

20:40.480 --> 20:42.667
A girl doesn't turn a shower
on clothes she's drying.

20:45.728 --> 20:46.687
Got a theory?

20:46.722 --> 20:48.320
Someone was cleaning
up their mess, maybe.

20:48.355 --> 20:50.258
Ran out without thinking
to turn off the shower?

20:53.723 --> 20:55.286
Wolfe, check this out.

20:58.133 --> 20:59.951
Whoa. Good times.

21:00.952 --> 21:03.764
In that DVD, she was scratching
Judge Greenhill with these.

21:06.562 --> 21:08.294
Yeah, there's blood.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.382
Let's get these to DNA.

21:18.058 --> 21:20.218
I told you. When I was
there, she controlled me.

21:20.253 --> 21:23.377
That's the point. I get tired
of making decisions all day.

21:23.604 --> 21:26.303
Lives in the balance. She
was a nice little vacation.

21:26.729 --> 21:28.674
And you never scratched
your little vacation?

21:28.887 --> 21:29.925
No, I did not.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.892
Then how do you explain her blood

21:32.289 --> 21:33.908
on this little ditty?

21:33.951 --> 21:36.067
I don't know what she did after I left.

21:36.102 --> 21:38.183
What she did after
you left was disappear.

21:38.218 --> 21:39.873
I want to know where she is.

21:39.908 --> 21:42.159
Watch your step, Lieutenant.
We're one door down

21:42.194 --> 21:45.588
from the Chief Judge and you
are throwing accusations at me

21:45.623 --> 21:47.449
with nothing to back them.

21:49.387 --> 21:50.680
Now,

21:50.793 --> 21:52.469
I'm going to dinner with my wife.

21:52.625 --> 21:53.868
Your Honor,

21:53.903 --> 21:55.466
you're a part of this.

21:56.190 --> 21:57.638
My best to your wife.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.897
Rather talk here than at
CSI in front of your people.

22:13.493 --> 22:14.871
I understand that.

22:16.632 --> 22:18.208
I'm not afraid...

22:19.053 --> 22:20.643
of a little geography.

22:21.396 --> 22:22.774
I need a statement

22:22.859 --> 22:24.506
detailing your actions, Lieutenant.

22:24.577 --> 22:25.926
Read my report.

22:25.961 --> 22:26.885
I did.

22:26.920 --> 22:29.363
You left out the part where you
ripped the guy's arm out of the socket

22:29.620 --> 22:32.333
The force that I used
was completely reasonable

22:32.368 --> 22:34.207
under the circumstances, Rick.

22:34.278 --> 22:36.295
Escalating force with an unarmed subject

22:36.330 --> 22:37.524
is always questionable.

22:37.559 --> 22:39.448
Yes, especially with a woman.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.221
Right, Rick?

22:41.334 --> 22:42.109
There is no woman in this case.

22:42.144 --> 22:44.167
There is always a woman in the case,

22:44.202 --> 22:46.191
and you know what I'm talking about.

22:48.037 --> 22:49.656
You're refusing to cooperate.

22:50.955 --> 22:52.554
I'm just curious. Did you ever take my

22:52.589 --> 22:54.136
advice and go to counselling
after Speedle's death?

22:54.171 --> 22:56.579
I will go, if you go.

22:59.398 --> 23:01.031
This is not going away.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.118
No, I would never,

23:03.743 --> 23:05.575
ever let that happen.

23:16.125 --> 23:16.826
Hey.

23:17.197 --> 23:17.994
You got a minute?

23:18.029 --> 23:19.001
Sure.

23:21.161 --> 23:22.002
What's going on?

23:23.147 --> 23:24.022
How you doing?

23:24.868 --> 23:27.540
I'm uh... I'm okay.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.220
I've heard about everything.

23:30.807 --> 23:32.352
I think Stetler's on a witch hunt.

23:32.387 --> 23:33.862
I've got the truth on my side.

23:33.897 --> 23:37.117
I'm just concerned that it's going to
be the bad guy's word against yours.

23:37.152 --> 23:41.063
You know, I was thinking, you have a right
to all documents related to this suit.

23:41.098 --> 23:44.178
I don't want to give Stetler any
more air time than he deserves.

23:44.213 --> 23:45.952
I really want to find Donna Scott.

23:45.987 --> 23:49.446
What if you just let me take a look at
the evidence, see what I can find out.

23:49.680 --> 23:50.913
I would appreciate that,

23:51.247 --> 23:55.879
but I really, right now,
want to find this girl.

23:58.072 --> 24:01.632
Technically Stetler can
have you relieved of duty,

24:01.667 --> 24:03.184
and then we're all in trouble.

24:04.570 --> 24:05.667
Okay.

24:06.634 --> 24:09.228
Okay, take a look and
tell me what you find.

24:09.778 --> 24:10.753
Okay.

24:10.788 --> 24:12.796
Okay, and thank you.

24:16.980 --> 24:17.774
Did you get something?

24:17.809 --> 24:18.761
I did.

24:22.768 --> 24:24.120
Judge Greenhill's case history.

24:24.155 --> 24:26.361
For the last five years, he's
been doing nothing but calendar,

24:26.396 --> 24:28.213
except for two high profiles.

24:28.248 --> 24:29.438
Stan the cat burglar

24:29.473 --> 24:32.041
we already know about,
and the Surfside Strangler.

24:32.085 --> 24:35.853
Right, the Surfside Strangler. The
truck driver who killed prostitutes.

24:39.823 --> 24:40.671
Eight of them.

24:40.706 --> 24:42.418
Buried them in the Everglades.

24:42.453 --> 24:44.130
In a peat bog to be specific.

24:44.165 --> 24:45.483
Preserved their bodies.

24:51.402 --> 24:52.753
Yeah, creep wanted it that way.

24:52.788 --> 24:55.244
Liked to go to the burial
site and visit his prizes.

24:55.279 --> 24:59.549
Okay, so what you're saying is if
Greenhill dumped her body out in the bog...

24:59.584 --> 25:01.476
It'll be blamed on
the Surfside Strangler.

25:01.511 --> 25:03.333
Because the dump sites
were never publicized.

25:03.368 --> 25:05.709
Yeah, and they were even
suppressed in the courtroom.

25:05.744 --> 25:08.921
Only a handful of people know
the location starting with...

25:08.956 --> 25:09.970
Well, besides the judge,

25:10.005 --> 25:12.220
there's the public defender
who moved to Brazil last year,

25:12.255 --> 25:14.294
the assistant prosecutor who
moved to South Carolina...

25:14.329 --> 25:16.333
Right, and the prosecutor
- who was the prosecutor?

25:17.712 --> 25:18.538
Me.

25:18.986 --> 25:19.866
I thought you knew that.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.287
I didn't know that.

25:22.322 --> 25:24.418
You are really sticking
your neck out here.

25:24.453 --> 25:25.505
I'm aware of that.

25:27.049 --> 25:29.975
Judge Greenhill's dangerous,
and very connected.

25:30.595 --> 25:33.237
But if he is involved, it
shouldn't matter, right?

25:35.161 --> 25:36.298
I'm just saying be careful.

25:41.039 --> 25:41.960
You, too.

25:55.696 --> 25:57.971
According the map, the peat
bog should be right up here.

26:36.209 --> 26:37.115
That's all eight victims.

26:37.954 --> 26:41.019
Yeah, well, if I was going to
copy this Surfside freak, I'd...

26:41.054 --> 26:42.082
Put her right in the middle?

26:42.117 --> 26:43.131
Yeah.

26:43.166 --> 26:44.154
Let's do it.

26:54.231 --> 26:56.318
Hey, hold on. Hands first.

26:56.353 --> 26:57.801
We don't know how deep she might be.

27:13.428 --> 27:14.238
Delko.

27:24.058 --> 27:26.003
Looks like the girl from the DVD.

27:27.007 --> 27:28.240
I'll make the calls.

27:45.731 --> 27:48.517
The acidity from the
peat kills any bacteria.

27:48.979 --> 27:50.715
It slows decomp way down.

27:51.380 --> 27:55.124
A body in a place like this,
can stay moist for centuries.

27:55.159 --> 27:56.750
It's what the judge was counting on.

27:56.785 --> 28:00.013
Well, the good news
is, it works both ways.

28:00.048 --> 28:01.406
What preserves the body...

28:02.373 --> 28:03.566
Preserves the evidence.

28:05.794 --> 28:06.665
Hmm...

28:06.700 --> 28:08.145
I've seen this before.

28:08.638 --> 28:09.536
It's vomit.

28:09.571 --> 28:10.287
Hers?

28:12.367 --> 28:13.144
No.

28:13.179 --> 28:14.464
Her mouth is clear.

28:15.145 --> 28:19.018
So if it's the killer's,
he threw up on her.

28:21.208 --> 28:22.528
It means he's not used to killing.

28:30.932 --> 28:33.589
Where's there's vomit, there's bile.

28:35.166 --> 28:36.909
And where there's bile...

28:36.944 --> 28:37.996
There's DNA.

28:39.048 --> 28:39.772
Horatio.

28:39.807 --> 28:40.733
Yeah.

28:40.768 --> 28:41.688
Thank you.

28:41.723 --> 28:43.234
You won't believe this.

28:43.269 --> 28:45.298
Got the results from
the bile on the hair.

28:45.333 --> 28:46.183
Did you get a match?

28:46.218 --> 28:47.971
Yes, but not to Judge Greenhill.

28:48.681 --> 28:51.403
We have come... full circle.

28:52.343 --> 28:53.249
I didn't do it.

28:53.909 --> 28:55.959
Your weak stomach says otherwise.

28:55.994 --> 29:00.784
the vomit we found in the
victim's hair, matches your DNA.

29:03.146 --> 29:04.445
All right, I guess I
should call my lawyer.

29:04.480 --> 29:05.369
You're wasting my time.

29:05.404 --> 29:06.202
What do you mean?

29:06.991 --> 29:12.005
Edward, you are a pawn, and you've been
hired to clean up somebody else's mess.

29:21.568 --> 29:23.327
Now, I want to know who it is.

29:23.362 --> 29:25.246
That's your job, isn't it?

29:26.246 --> 29:31.583
Edward, whoever you are covering
for is about to put you in jail.

29:43.544 --> 29:44.279
Hey what's up

29:44.314 --> 29:46.748
I'm looking through
the roof guy's stuff.

29:46.783 --> 29:49.480
There's no lighter, no matches,

29:49.515 --> 29:52.055
no roach clip, no roach.

29:52.922 --> 29:53.750
Excuse me?

29:53.785 --> 29:55.200
I can't find them.

29:57.200 --> 29:58.919
Okay, I'll play.

30:00.552 --> 30:01.813
Smell this.

30:04.847 --> 30:07.424
Uh... body odor...

30:07.459 --> 30:08.881
fast food...

30:09.929 --> 30:10.763
So?

30:11.676 --> 30:13.469
Guy said he was smoking
dope on the roof.

30:14.703 --> 30:16.370
Not on this shirt. He's lying.

30:22.740 --> 30:24.261
Little lie, big lie.

30:25.295 --> 30:26.243
Where you going?

30:26.278 --> 30:28.034
I need to go see a doctor.

30:28.069 --> 30:31.745
Will you check and see if Valera can
pull any saliva off this narco evidence?

30:32.694 --> 30:33.611
You got it.

30:37.789 --> 30:39.982
Hey, Alexx, I need an unbiased opinion.

30:41.269 --> 30:44.220
People only say that when
they already know the answer

30:44.255 --> 30:46.937
and they're shopping for
someone to agree with them.

30:46.972 --> 30:49.052
You are very smart.

30:49.087 --> 30:50.414
That much I know, honey.

30:50.449 --> 30:52.244
Now what's this about?

30:57.058 --> 30:58.019
Well,

30:59.389 --> 31:03.917
according to this film, there was, in fact,
an anterior dislocation of the shoulder.

31:04.300 --> 31:08.391
When a shoulder is dislocated the
humerus pops out of its socket.

31:08.426 --> 31:12.085
The ball is jammed against the
sharp corner of the glenoid,

31:12.120 --> 31:15.516
making a notch that's
called the Hill-Sachs defect.

31:15.551 --> 31:17.147
And you can see this defect?

31:17.182 --> 31:18.530
Big as the Florida pan.

31:19.640 --> 31:20.802
Wait a minute.

31:21.427 --> 31:22.652
There is something else.

31:22.687 --> 31:27.623
This guy sustained an impaction
fracture of the glenoid neck.

31:28.186 --> 31:29.268
What does that mean?

31:29.745 --> 31:31.240
How much time you got?

31:34.105 --> 31:35.525
Do you recognize these?

31:37.698 --> 31:38.644
Yeah, that's my weed.

31:38.679 --> 31:41.362
And yes, possessing it is illegal.

31:41.958 --> 31:45.430
Still that's no reason for Lieutenant
Caine ripping my arm out of my socket.

31:45.825 --> 31:48.025
So you went to the roof to smoke pot

31:48.060 --> 31:49.873
and you didn't take any matches?

31:50.595 --> 31:51.648
Must have dropped them.

31:52.058 --> 31:54.994
No. We searched the
entire area. Try again.

31:55.029 --> 31:56.272
And you know what else?

31:56.307 --> 31:57.854
Your clothes don't smell like pot.

31:57.889 --> 32:01.549
And there is a very telltale odor of
someone involved in that kind of activity.

32:01.584 --> 32:02.597
I must have lied.

32:03.230 --> 32:04.183
To say the least.

32:05.141 --> 32:08.069
Why don't you explain to me why
Stanley Hemming's saliva's on your pot.

32:09.012 --> 32:09.845
He gave them to me.

32:15.362 --> 32:16.316
Why?

32:18.872 --> 32:20.497
He said he was doing a job,

32:20.532 --> 32:22.950
and that he was too
dinged up to go back.

32:22.985 --> 32:25.327
So he wanted me to go over there
and pick up his climbing stuff.

32:25.362 --> 32:27.671
The reason why he was "dinged up"

32:27.706 --> 32:31.321
is because he fell three stories off
a building and crushed a man to death.

32:38.205 --> 32:39.135
You knew that.

32:39.170 --> 32:42.552
And that's why when Lieutenant Caine
approached you, you disobeyed his orders.

32:43.615 --> 32:44.814
That cop assaulted me.

32:46.336 --> 32:49.905
After your dust up with Lieutenant Caine
you were taken by Officer Payton to booking.

32:49.940 --> 32:52.427
There were no complaints
of injury... to anyone.

32:52.462 --> 32:53.896
So, I tried to tough it out.

32:53.931 --> 32:55.943
Actually, you tried to
make your injuries worse.

32:55.978 --> 32:57.649
Go after a cop.

32:57.384 --> 32:58.404
Collect some money.

32:59.553 --> 33:00.875
That's your word against mine.

33:01.977 --> 33:03.027
Not exactly.

33:03.062 --> 33:04.946
I spoke to a doctor.

33:04.981 --> 33:08.457
You have impaction of the glenoid neck.

33:09.465 --> 33:12.148
Your arm was twisted almost
completely out of its socket,

33:12.183 --> 33:14.932
and the only way to create
that kind of impaction fracture

33:14.967 --> 33:17.931
is by repeated contact
with a very hard surface.

33:17.997 --> 33:22.241
For example, concrete, cinder
block, just like in our holding cell.

33:26.610 --> 33:27.811
You did this to yourself.

33:39.607 --> 33:40.521
It must have hurt.

33:45.238 --> 33:48.039
How about you withdraw your
claim against Lieutenant Caine?

33:54.340 --> 33:55.354
Okay.

33:57.903 --> 33:58.902
What do I have to do?

34:00.845 --> 34:02.142
Call your lawyer.

34:12.204 --> 34:13.101
He's all yours.

34:14.260 --> 34:15.029
Good job.

34:15.716 --> 34:16.438
You know,

34:16.909 --> 34:19.792
the truth was there the whole time
if you had bothered to investigate.

34:20.405 --> 34:21.382
You don't know my job.

34:22.150 --> 34:23.654
Lucky for you, I know mine.

34:29.324 --> 34:30.139
Creepy.

34:31.094 --> 34:33.328
Hard to believe she was
in that bog for a month.

34:33.362 --> 34:34.973
Tannins preserve the body.

34:35.007 --> 34:36.297
You have a cause of death?

34:36.493 --> 34:38.783
She not only looks
perfect, she is perfect.

34:38.818 --> 34:41.234
No internal or external injuries.

34:41.268 --> 34:42.485
Heart's unremarkable.

34:42.521 --> 34:43.753
No brain trauma.

34:43.788 --> 34:45.393
What about asphyxia?

34:45.428 --> 34:47.952
No petechiae, no ligature marks...

34:49.399 --> 34:50.773
unless...

34:52.092 --> 34:53.705
She died before she bruised.

34:54.489 --> 34:55.876
Hand me the UV, please.

35:03.541 --> 35:05.903
No subcu bruising

35:05.938 --> 35:07.086
that I can see.

35:07.645 --> 35:08.421
Hang on, Alexx.

35:08.456 --> 35:10.123
What's... that around her mouth?

35:14.631 --> 35:15.712
She was smothered.

35:22.323 --> 35:23.365
That's not from a hand.

35:23.400 --> 35:25.923
No. No, looks like a...

35:25.958 --> 35:28.225
mark from an oxygen mask.

35:28.580 --> 35:30.798
A mask, but not an oxygen mask.

35:30.833 --> 35:33.406
She used sex toys, right?

35:34.544 --> 35:38.081
Nitrous oxide. That's the way these
things are supposed to enhance pleasure.

35:38.116 --> 35:39.802
This girl got the opposite.

35:39.837 --> 35:41.072
O.D.'d.

35:41.107 --> 35:42.493
Fits.

35:42.528 --> 35:45.556
A nitrous overdose leaves
no specific findings.

35:45.591 --> 35:48.308
Enters the blood through the lungs,

35:48.343 --> 35:49.908
displacing the oxygen.

35:49.943 --> 35:53.838
Travels through the heart, up the
spine to the medulla oblongata.

35:53.873 --> 35:55.876
Binds to the brain stem.

35:55.911 --> 35:57.483
Stopped breathing.

35:57.518 --> 35:59.318
We know what the murder weapon is.

35:59.882 --> 36:02.931
Now we just need to find
out where it came from.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.931
This is the perfect place to
hide sex tapes and murder weapons.

36:09.966 --> 36:12.534
Based on his pad,
everything has its place.

36:21.989 --> 36:24.078
Edward Mathis may have
made our job easier.

36:24.113 --> 36:24.940
He's O.C.D.

36:24.975 --> 36:27.196
Sounds like someone I know.

36:28.556 --> 36:31.874
So, where would you keep
a nitrous oxide canister?

36:54.227 --> 36:55.067
Bingo.

36:57.989 --> 37:01.069
Ha, twisted minds think alike.

37:02.804 --> 37:03.852
Take a look at this.

37:06.499 --> 37:07.376
Good work.

37:57.668 --> 38:01.454
The DNA we found inside the mask,
Eric, is a match to Donna Scott.

38:01.489 --> 38:03.027
So, it's definitely our murder weapon.

38:03.062 --> 38:05.621
That's correct. Now,
all we need is a killer.

38:05.973 --> 38:07.070
Almost there.

38:11.066 --> 38:13.587
Fingerprints belong to...

38:13.622 --> 38:16.642
Whoa. That's not the judge's clerk.

38:16.677 --> 38:19.376
No, but it is a familiar
face, isn't it, Eric?

38:19.411 --> 38:20.841
I'll be in court.

38:21.900 --> 38:22.692
Your Honor.

38:25.222 --> 38:26.142
Oh, Lieutenant.

38:27.752 --> 38:28.914
Got a minute?

38:29.697 --> 38:30.674
Yeah, sure.

38:30.709 --> 38:32.536
Well, I'll leave y'all to your business.

38:32.571 --> 38:36.039
Actually, it's you I
came to see, Judge Ratner.

38:36.074 --> 38:37.302
I beg your pardon?

38:37.337 --> 38:39.438
Donna Scott, gentlemen.

38:40.424 --> 38:42.082
Turns out that you share clerks

38:42.117 --> 38:44.549
and tee times and now a prostitute,

38:44.584 --> 38:47.796
but only of you is responsible
for killing the girl.

38:48.278 --> 38:49.264
Joe, what's he...

38:49.299 --> 38:53.805
She died as a result of an
overdose of nitrous oxide.

38:53.840 --> 38:55.090
Judge Ratner,

38:55.806 --> 38:59.080
your fingerprints were on this
mask, the mask that killed her.

38:59.115 --> 39:00.675
Her DNA is inside.

39:21.201 --> 39:22.033
Donna.

39:25.457 --> 39:26.298
Donna?

39:29.086 --> 39:31.910
Once in trouble, you turned
to your clerk, Edward Mathis.

39:32.763 --> 39:35.866
He was only too happy to
oblige in cleaning up your mess.

39:42.756 --> 39:44.435
I've done a little
checking into your holdings,

39:44.470 --> 39:47.944
and it seems that you've signed your
timeshare in Bal Harbour over to Mathis.

39:49.362 --> 39:50.605
This is ridiculous.

39:51.316 --> 39:54.086
What, you just working your
way around chamber to chamber?

39:54.121 --> 39:56.388
You going to ruin all our
reputations, is that it?

39:57.393 --> 39:59.474
Lieutenant, we're the good guys.

39:59.509 --> 40:00.454
Is that a fact?

40:00.489 --> 40:02.903
Judge Greenhill, are you
aware that Judge Ratner here

40:02.938 --> 40:05.449
was willing to let you take the
fall for this young girl's death?

40:09.490 --> 40:10.611
You're on your own, Joe.

40:10.746 --> 40:13.326
Isaac, where you think you're going?

40:13.361 --> 40:14.414
Isaac!

40:17.663 --> 40:18.923
I'm due on the bench.

40:19.559 --> 40:20.711
You're under arrest.

40:20.746 --> 40:23.962
I'll surrender myself, make bail
and hear the case in the morning.

40:23.997 --> 40:25.726
I don't think you
understand the situation.

40:25.761 --> 40:27.287
No, I don't think you understand, sir.

40:27.948 --> 40:30.061
You see, I'm Chief
Judge of this courthouse.

40:30.096 --> 40:33.846
The way I figure, this goin' take about
three years for this to get to trial.

40:33.881 --> 40:35.702
Hell, five with my friends.

40:35.737 --> 40:36.675
I'm a patient man.

40:36.710 --> 40:38.035
Good. Good, Lieutenant.

40:38.634 --> 40:41.529
In the meantime, you gonna
have how many cases before me?

40:42.176 --> 40:43.486
Are you threatening me?

40:44.575 --> 40:47.501
Oh, your solve record's
about to drop markedly.

40:48.802 --> 40:50.709
I won't forget you, Lieutenant.

40:51.196 --> 40:55.134
And I won't forget
Donna Scott, Your Honor.

41:15.267 --> 41:16.112
Rick.

41:19.992 --> 41:21.251
Looks like you got a pass.

41:21.914 --> 41:23.437
Guy from the roof dropped the charges.

41:23.794 --> 41:25.491
Yes, well, rule number one:

41:25.526 --> 41:27.952
Never mess with Calleigh Duquesne, Rick.

41:29.702 --> 41:32.699
You've been referred to Support
Services for psychiatric counselling.

41:32.739 --> 41:33.652
I don't need counselling.

41:34.298 --> 41:36.213
Your post-traumatic incident interview.

41:36.248 --> 41:38.266
After Speedle's
shooting, you never went.

41:38.301 --> 41:39.418
Neither did you, Rick.

41:41.536 --> 41:42.569
Appointment's Friday.

41:43.105 --> 41:43.987
Mandatory.

41:48.513 --> 41:49.861
No, it's always the same.

41:51.366 --> 41:52.513
I'm in the jewellery store.

41:54.886 --> 41:55.872
It's slow-motion...

41:59.499 --> 42:00.756
I withdraw my weapon.

42:03.038 --> 42:04.023
I brandish it.

42:06.042 --> 42:07.580
I squeeze the trigger...

42:08.706 --> 42:10.562
and... nothing.

42:12.278 --> 42:13.270
Nothing happens.

42:13.305 --> 42:14.501
It jams.

42:15.360 --> 42:17.058
Yours didn't. Speedle's did.

42:18.923 --> 42:19.793
Horatio...

42:20.881 --> 42:22.338
there's nothing you could have done.

42:30.392 --> 42:31.685
I wish I felt that way.

42:51.804 --> 42:52.684
Ma'am.

42:54.979 --> 42:55.894
Sir.
