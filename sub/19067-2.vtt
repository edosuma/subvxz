01:01.478 --> 01:03.814
[Pidge screaming]

01:03.897 --> 01:05.482
What just happened?

01:05.566 --> 01:10.279
-I don't know, but we gotta stay together.
-[both screaming]

01:15.075 --> 01:17.244
[both screaming]

01:17.327 --> 01:18.620
-[beeping]
-[loud crash]

01:18.704 --> 01:20.581
[water bubbling]

01:25.752 --> 01:28.922
-[alarm blaring]
-[groaning]

01:29.006 --> 01:32.926
-Hunk, you okay? Hunk?
-[retching]

01:33.010 --> 01:35.304
-I'm fine.
-You just threw up, didn't you?

01:35.387 --> 01:39.016
Yeah. You would too if you got sucked
out of a wormhole at light speed,

01:39.099 --> 01:41.601
then crash-landed on an ice planet
and ended up underwater.

01:41.685 --> 01:44.604
-That is what happened to me!
-Oh, right.

01:45.856 --> 01:49.526
My main system is down. The crash must
have screwed it up. Does yours work?

01:49.610 --> 01:52.988
I'm on reserve power.
My lion's pretty much dead in the water.

01:53.071 --> 01:57.075
[groans] <i>This situation's bad enough,</i>
<i>Hunk. Don't make it worse with puns.</i>

01:57.159 --> 02:01.622
[Hunk] I'm just shocked we hit a planet.
I thought Pidge said space was 90% empty.

02:01.705 --> 02:04.207
[Lance] Well, apparently,
Pidge's science is wrong.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.919
[Hunk] We need to contact the others
and get back to group immediately.

02:09.003 --> 02:11.965
Hello, anyone? This is Hunk and Lance
of the Yellow and Blue Lions.

02:12.049 --> 02:15.344
-They know the color of our lions!
-Oh, right. Okay, yeah.

02:15.427 --> 02:17.304
I always forget that. My bad.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.309
[groans]

02:22.392 --> 02:25.062
We gotta check for damage
and get these lions running.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.355
-<i>Copy that.</i>
-Oh, good.

02:26.438 --> 02:29.524
The Blue Lion's coming back online now.
Welcome back, beautiful.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.571
Uh...

02:34.655 --> 02:38.116
Hunk, did... did you just see
something swim by?

02:38.200 --> 02:39.868
<i>What? No.</i>

02:42.621 --> 02:47.209
No way! This is going to sound crazy,
but I think I just saw a mermaid.

02:47.292 --> 02:50.754
Oh, boy. Okay, how hard did you
bang your head when we hit the planet?

02:50.837 --> 02:52.756
Dude, I'm serious!
[gasps]

02:52.839 --> 02:56.259
Look! There it is again!
Hey, come here!

02:56.343 --> 02:59.179
Where you going? Hey, slow down!

02:59.262 --> 03:03.475
Lance, knock it off. We have to stay
focused and get to the others...

03:03.558 --> 03:06.937
-You're outside of your lion. Great.
<i>-I know we have to find the others.</i>

03:07.020 --> 03:08.730
<i>I'm just saying maybe this thing can help.</i>

03:08.814 --> 03:12.651
Also, it's a mermaid. A mermaid!
Come on, let's find it.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.570
<i>No. No way. Nope. Not going out there.</i>

03:15.654 --> 03:19.116
Okay, you stay here,
by yourself, in the dark,

03:19.199 --> 03:21.910
all alone in a lion
that's out of commission.

03:21.993 --> 03:23.370
Don't leave me!

03:30.836 --> 03:32.045
Come on!

03:42.139 --> 03:45.726
I can't believe this!
We're really chasing a mermaid.

03:45.809 --> 03:48.520
[giggling]

03:48.603 --> 03:50.480
Hey, wait, wait, wait! We're friendly!

03:50.939 --> 03:52.023
[both gasp]

03:57.863 --> 03:59.281
[both]
Whoa!

03:59.364 --> 04:00.490
-Hello.
-[both scream]

04:00.574 --> 04:02.200
Welcome to my village.

04:02.284 --> 04:04.661
Here, all are safe and warm.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.373
[both scream]

04:08.457 --> 04:12.669
Please, do not startle our guests.
I am Florona.

04:12.753 --> 04:17.173
The almighty Queen Luxia, keeper of
our land, would love to meet with you.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.968
Wait. How did your queen know
we were here?

04:20.051 --> 04:22.095
Queen Luxia knows all.

04:28.602 --> 04:32.439
Lance, I know this mermaid thing is
a dream of yours, but we really gotta go.

04:32.522 --> 04:36.193
We will, big guy, we will,
but let's meet this queen first.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.028
Besides, maybe she can help us.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.072
And, if I just happen to find
the future Mrs. Blue Lion,

04:41.156 --> 04:43.575
well, then that is all right with me.

04:54.795 --> 04:59.216
Space travelers, I am Queen Luxia.

04:59.299 --> 05:03.261
I welcome you to our village
as honored guests.

05:03.345 --> 05:06.264
The honor's all ours.
I'm La-a-a-ance. [grunts]

05:06.348 --> 05:08.683
Uh, Mrs. Queen,
Your Honor, Your Excellence,

05:08.767 --> 05:12.145
I'm Hunk, and me and my buddy here,
we crash-landed on your lovely planet,

05:12.229 --> 05:16.066
but we really need to get back in touch
with our friends who are in space.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.318
Would you possibly have
any way of doing that?

05:18.401 --> 05:22.197
Hunk, Lance,
I can solve all of your problems.

05:22.280 --> 05:26.493
-Here, we are all safe and warm.
-You use magic, don't you?

05:26.576 --> 05:29.955
I bet this castle's a ship.
This castle is a ship, am I right?

05:30.038 --> 05:33.750
-Just don't say anything if I'm right.
-Here, I've brought you these.

05:33.834 --> 05:37.963
The bubble coral will provide you
with all the air you need.

05:38.046 --> 05:41.174
Whoa-ho-ho!

05:41.258 --> 05:42.551
Thank you, Fish Queen.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.888
Huh. Cool.

05:46.972 --> 05:51.601
And rest assured, your space vessels
will be well protected.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.688
Now, please, follow me.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.106
What is that?

05:56.189 --> 06:01.695
That is the giver of life to our people,
the Baku Garden.

06:01.778 --> 06:05.991
When the waters froze over,
we were forced to live down here.

06:06.074 --> 06:09.953
The garden provides us the warmth
and food we need to survive.

06:10.036 --> 06:16.626
Because of it, we are taken care of.
Here, all are safe and warm.

06:17.294 --> 06:20.338
[mermaids giggling]

06:22.549 --> 06:23.550
[giggling]

06:26.928 --> 06:30.599
Your Royalness-- [clears throat]
if I may, this food is amazing.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.517
It's even better
than Balmeran cave bugs.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.477
I'm glad you enjoy it.

06:34.561 --> 06:39.858
It was picked fresh from the Baku Garden.
And I hope you enjoy the entertainment.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.736
[sultry dance music playing]

06:48.199 --> 06:49.743
Whoa.

06:56.207 --> 06:59.961
So, about us getting in contact
with our friends... how can you help us?

07:00.045 --> 07:04.007
Please, let's discuss that
after the dance.

07:12.432 --> 07:16.144
Whoa, this dance is amazing. It's the...

07:16.227 --> 07:18.438
It's the most amazing thing
I've ever seen.

07:18.521 --> 07:21.858
I'm glad you enjoy it.
Put your mind at ease.

07:21.942 --> 07:25.695
Let your consciousness drift
like the tide.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.323
Yes, I will do that.

07:28.406 --> 07:31.826
I... Were-- Weren't we just
talking about something?

07:31.910 --> 07:34.704
You were just telling me
how much you like it here,

07:34.788 --> 07:37.791
how much you wanted to stay forever.

07:37.874 --> 07:42.629
Oh, that's right.
Here, we are all safe and warm.

07:42.712 --> 07:46.007
Lance, I think
we should stay here forever.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.592
Okay.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.889
[snoring]

07:56.643 --> 08:00.480
I don't need pants. I'm a mermaid.

08:06.778 --> 08:08.113
Huh?

08:08.196 --> 08:09.447
Who are...?

08:09.572 --> 08:11.616
[snoring]

08:14.703 --> 08:18.081
[snoring]

08:24.671 --> 08:26.840
Leave him. We have to get out of here.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.394
[sighs, smacks lips]

08:39.477 --> 08:40.562
Hello?

08:40.645 --> 08:44.441
-Good morning. Where am I?
-He's awake.

08:45.900 --> 08:49.279
Why am I blindfolded?
Is this a game?

08:49.362 --> 08:51.406
[gasps]
I like games.

08:54.325 --> 08:58.329
Wait, where am I? Why am I blindfolded?
Is this a game? I hate games!

08:58.413 --> 08:59.289
[grunts]

08:59.372 --> 09:02.584
It's okay. You were mind-swished,
but now we want to--

09:02.667 --> 09:04.127
Kill me? Think again!

09:04.210 --> 09:05.170
[groans]

09:06.504 --> 09:07.964
-[grunts]
-[screaming]

09:08.048 --> 09:09.215
Wait! Come back!

09:10.133 --> 09:11.760
[screams]

09:13.553 --> 09:16.890
[screaming repeatedly]

09:18.683 --> 09:19.559
Huh?

09:20.143 --> 09:22.312
[laughing]

09:22.395 --> 09:23.563
Aw!

09:24.564 --> 09:26.232
[screaming]

09:26.316 --> 09:29.611
-Don't hurt me!
-Please, we are not here to hurt you.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.822
We brought you here to ask
for your help. I am Plaxum.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.408
-Blumfump.
-Swirn.

09:35.492 --> 09:40.330
Are you saying names, or is this some
kind of weird spell you're putting on me?

09:40.413 --> 09:42.999
We believe you are our savior.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.544
You guys think I'm your savior?
What do you want with me?

09:46.628 --> 09:50.048
The queen is mind-swishing everyone,
controlling their thoughts.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.842
We believe you can stop her.

09:55.053 --> 09:56.930
[snoring]

10:00.683 --> 10:01.684
[moans]

10:02.310 --> 10:05.522
Lance? Lance, you around?

10:06.648 --> 10:08.525
Lance?

10:10.193 --> 10:11.778
Is everything all right?

10:11.861 --> 10:15.907
I can't find Lance.
Also, there's a hole in our wall.

10:15.990 --> 10:19.828
There was a break-in.
Those cave-dwellers must have taken him.

10:19.911 --> 10:22.455
Them again? What should we do?

10:22.539 --> 10:24.999
Those meddling mermaids are harmless,

10:25.083 --> 10:27.127
but the air-breather could
prove troublesome

10:27.210 --> 10:29.671
if he doesn't fall back
under our control.

10:29.754 --> 10:33.967
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Who needs to fall
under our control? Is Lance gone?

10:34.050 --> 10:36.719
-We gotta find Lance.
-And we will.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.139
Don't worry your little mind about it.

10:39.222 --> 10:43.977
But first, we need to sit down and eat,
talk, clear our heads.

10:44.060 --> 10:47.939
No, I'm not really sure if I can eat
right now. If Lance has been taken...

10:48.022 --> 10:52.068
[moans]
Oh, boy. That... That is good, though.

10:52.152 --> 10:58.491
See? That's all you need.
Here, we are all safe and warm.

10:59.242 --> 11:00.660
Okay.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.330
They are going to come.

11:04.414 --> 11:09.836
We must destroy what remains of their kind
and bring Lance under our control.

11:09.919 --> 11:14.757
But first, Florona, you were in charge
of watching the air-breathers.

11:14.841 --> 11:18.219
So, now, it is time for you
to take a swim in the garden.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.347
Yes, My Queen.

11:23.558 --> 11:24.809
Wait. Wait a minute. Okay.

11:24.893 --> 11:27.604
You're trying to tell me the queen
is brainwashing people?

11:27.687 --> 11:30.231
But she's so safe and warm.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.692
[Swirn]
What do you remember from yesterday?

11:32.775 --> 11:35.904
I remember we crashed,
saw the mermaids and the village,

11:35.987 --> 11:39.824
then we had dinner,
and then, uh... we, uh...

11:39.908 --> 11:43.995
You can't remember
because you were under her control.

11:44.078 --> 11:47.832
Our theory is, the queen controls minds

11:47.916 --> 11:52.545
by using her voice to strike certain
head switches in your ear pan.

11:52.629 --> 11:56.049
And her magnetic stare locks on
to your eye-to-brain pathway plug.

11:56.132 --> 12:01.471
Plus, her mind-control sonar is always
broadcasting through the waters.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.849
Bong! Bong! Bong!

12:04.933 --> 12:09.145
She trains her people to use hypnotic
movements to lull you under her control.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.730
I do remember a dancer.

12:10.813 --> 12:14.484
Good, because I haven't finished
my picture for that one.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.528
But you see, she was infecting your brain!

12:18.279 --> 12:21.950
Holy crow! I had a mind-controlling
brain infection! [yelps]

12:26.079 --> 12:27.163
[Plaxum]
Sit.

12:27.246 --> 12:30.583
[Blumfump] The entire village
is under the queen's mind control.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.919
The only reason we aren't

12:33.002 --> 12:37.507
is because we wear these jellyfish
that hide our brains from her powers.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.176
It's like we have no brains whatsoever.

12:40.259 --> 12:43.304
You can't control what doesn't exist.

12:43.388 --> 12:44.681
Right. Of course.

12:44.764 --> 12:48.309
-Our heads are completely empty.
-Yeah, I get it.

12:48.393 --> 12:53.773
Many years ago, the queen froze over
the surface by blocking the thermal vents.

12:53.856 --> 12:58.027
She forced everyone to the depths,
where she began to brainwash them.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.196
They became her prisoners.

13:00.279 --> 13:03.324
-What size?
-Eight and seven-eighths aquameters.

13:03.408 --> 13:06.202
But what's the point?
Why mind-control the mermaids?

13:06.285 --> 13:08.621
-To kill them!
-Really?

13:08.705 --> 13:11.082
Well, we don't know that for sure,

13:11.165 --> 13:14.794
but hundreds of mermaids
have disappeared and never come back.

13:21.592 --> 13:26.639
Goodbye, Florona.
It is time to return to the giver of life.

13:41.654 --> 13:45.366
[Swirn] We've tried to take out the queen,
but failed several times.

13:45.450 --> 13:50.163
And every attempt depletes our numbers.
Now, there are only three of us left.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.915
Without you, there is no hope.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.918
-Found one!
-What do you want from me?

13:56.002 --> 13:57.962
We saw the mer-cat you came in.

13:58.046 --> 14:01.382
We think it can stand up
against the queen and her forces.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.301
But first, you'll need one of these.

14:03.384 --> 14:06.429
Now, they sting pretty bad
and don't smell great.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.181
If my theory is correct,

14:08.264 --> 14:12.226
the smelliest ones block
the most mind-control rays.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.395
-Are you a scientist?
-No.

14:14.479 --> 14:17.148
Also, they can sometimes
make your face swell,

14:17.231 --> 14:19.609
and you might experience hearing loss.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.819
Would you just put it on, already?

14:23.988 --> 14:26.949
-[screams] It burns!
-That means it's working!

14:27.033 --> 14:28.951
[groaning]

14:29.035 --> 14:30.620
[mumbling]
So, what's the plan?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.790
Here's what Blumfump came up with.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.375
This is you.

14:35.458 --> 14:39.337
You act like you're still thought-swirled
and get past the guards.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.547
Get your mer-cat and grab the queen.

14:41.631 --> 14:45.635
We'll mount a full-scale attack
on the castle and free the people.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.720
Then, I'll be a hero.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.556
[high voice]
"Oh, Lance, you're so handsome!"

14:50.640 --> 14:51.891
[normal voice]
"And modest."

14:51.974 --> 14:53.893
[high voice]
"Oh, thank you for saving us.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.686
Can I kiss you?"

14:55.770 --> 14:57.438
[normal voice]
"Maybe just a little."

14:57.522 --> 14:59.065
[kissing noises]

14:59.148 --> 15:01.901
Well, now, you're just
making a tree kiss a turtle.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.946
That's a turtle?
But there's an actual turtle right here.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.156
We needed the turtle to play the wall.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.283
If your acting fails you,

15:09.367 --> 15:13.079
this holds three doses of antidote
to use on the guards.

15:13.162 --> 15:16.374
It should interrupt
the queen's mind-control long enough

15:16.457 --> 15:17.834
for you to escape.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.710
I don't think I'll be needing this.

15:19.794 --> 15:24.298
I missed 14 days of the third grade
for a stomachache I never really had.

15:28.302 --> 15:32.640
Hello, mer-guards! Isn't everything
just so safe and warm here?

15:32.723 --> 15:35.685
Anyway, I'm off to my lion--
Oh, come on!

15:39.021 --> 15:40.064
[groans]

15:40.148 --> 15:43.234
I had a feeling you'd come
for your vessel.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.778
Servant, take Lance to the Baku Garden.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.991
[gasps]
Hunk?

15:51.492 --> 15:54.954
Hey, buddy, it's me!
Snap out of it! It's Lance!

15:56.456 --> 15:57.540
[groans]

15:58.666 --> 16:00.251
[yells]
Darn it!

16:01.919 --> 16:03.588
[grunting]

16:04.422 --> 16:06.424
Everyone, capture him!

16:10.178 --> 16:11.804
[grunting]

16:11.888 --> 16:12.847
[yells]

16:14.223 --> 16:15.141
[groans]

16:15.224 --> 16:17.143
[screams, whimpers]

16:18.186 --> 16:21.981
[laughs, grunts]

16:23.024 --> 16:24.525
[screams]

16:25.735 --> 16:27.320
[groans]

16:28.863 --> 16:30.114
[grunting]

16:30.198 --> 16:32.742
Hunk, please! I don't want to hurt you!

16:32.825 --> 16:35.620
Must keep Queen safe and warm.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.330
[grunts]

16:39.165 --> 16:42.877
[squeaking]

16:45.546 --> 16:46.756
[groans]

16:46.839 --> 16:49.050
[whimpering]

16:49.133 --> 16:52.345
[grunting]

16:54.055 --> 16:55.890
[moans]
Whoa!

16:55.973 --> 16:59.977
Whoa! Where am I? What am I doing?
Is that a jellyfish on your head?

17:00.061 --> 17:03.439
Hunk, you've been mind-controlled
by the queen and you're trying to kill me.

17:03.523 --> 17:07.026
-Oh, really? Sorry. My bad.
-We're kind of in the middle of a battle.

17:07.108 --> 17:10.363
-So, I'm going to need your help.
-Got it.

17:11.696 --> 17:13.449
[Lance] Oh!
[Hunk] Uh...

17:14.492 --> 17:16.702
-Uh... Uh...
-[gasps]

17:16.827 --> 17:19.121
-[grunts]
-Huh?

17:25.377 --> 17:27.755
[grunting]

17:31.968 --> 17:33.386
[grunting]

17:34.011 --> 17:37.306
-Now, who are these weirdos?
-Those weirdos are with us.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.642
Come, we must hurry to your mer-cats.

17:42.103 --> 17:44.021
[growls]

17:44.105 --> 17:46.357
-[Lance] You hanging on?
-Yes! Let's go!

17:46.440 --> 17:48.609
-What's the plan?
-We need to grab the queen

17:48.693 --> 17:50.861
and take her to an ice prison
Blumfump built,

17:50.945 --> 17:52.655
where her mind-control powers
will be trapped

17:52.738 --> 17:54.740
because of the thick ice
and the jellyfish.

17:54.824 --> 17:57.326
-Okay, who's that?
-It's Plaxum. Just go with it.

18:00.121 --> 18:01.289
[Hunk]
There she is!

18:03.499 --> 18:04.709
[grunting]

18:07.670 --> 18:09.880
-[grunting]
-[groans]

18:12.216 --> 18:13.467
[Lance]
Got her!

18:17.179 --> 18:20.975
[groans]
Where am I? What's going on?

18:21.058 --> 18:24.270
What's going on is you're not
mind-controlling these people anymore,

18:24.353 --> 18:25.229
Your Majesty.

18:25.313 --> 18:28.649
What? Mind-control? Me?

18:28.733 --> 18:32.320
No! Please, my people are in danger!
You must go back!

18:32.403 --> 18:35.031
-What's going on?
-[Plaxum] <i>Nothing! It's a ruse.</i>

18:35.114 --> 18:38.409
-Are you sure?
-I wasn't controlling anyone.

18:38.492 --> 18:40.286
[gasps]
The Baku!

18:40.369 --> 18:43.122
-She's lying!
-I'm not. Please!

18:43.205 --> 18:47.418
<i>The last thing I remember is that organism</i>
<i>in the garden falling from space.</i>

18:47.501 --> 18:50.421
<i>I went to inspect it.</i>
<i>I thought it was a plant.</i>

18:50.504 --> 18:52.715
[Hunk] <i>Wait a second.</i>
<i>We've been eating that plant.</i>

18:52.798 --> 18:56.636
And it's delicious!
It's so safe and warm.

18:56.719 --> 19:00.514
A-ha! Mind-swishing!
It was the plant the whole time.

19:00.598 --> 19:03.017
And the queen was the first one
to be mind-controlled.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.393
But why?

19:04.477 --> 19:09.857
The Baku has been harvesting us all.
We are its food source.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.275
No way!

19:11.359 --> 19:14.570
I think she's telling the truth.
Look out the window.

19:22.953 --> 19:25.998
[roars]

19:26.999 --> 19:29.669
You two get somewhere safe.
Okay, Hunk, change of plans.

19:29.752 --> 19:33.214
The queen is actually good
and that thing is bad. Let's take it out.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.175
[roars]

19:39.178 --> 19:40.596
[yelling]

19:45.434 --> 19:47.853
That thing's too quick for me.
I can't hit it!

19:47.937 --> 19:49.980
-My lion's not very good in water.
-Really?

19:50.064 --> 19:51.524
My lion's moving better than ever.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.192
There's something
about fighting underwater

19:53.275 --> 19:55.444
that's making me feel
extra quick and powerful.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.947
-I think I know how to stop that thing.
-How?

19:58.030 --> 19:59.907
We gotta stop shooting
where the creature is

19:59.990 --> 20:01.826
and start shooting
where the creature's gonna be.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.203
[growling]

20:05.913 --> 20:06.747
I got it!

20:09.875 --> 20:11.836
[groaning, panting]

20:14.755 --> 20:17.425
[roaring]

20:18.843 --> 20:20.886
[Lance laughs]
Now, the hunter becomes--

20:20.970 --> 20:23.973
-Oh, no, he's free!
-[yelling]

20:26.726 --> 20:29.061
[screams, grunts]

20:29.854 --> 20:31.397
[roars]

20:32.898 --> 20:34.400
[creature screams]

20:45.578 --> 20:46.996
-What?
-[electronic beeping]

20:48.205 --> 20:49.498
Here goes nothing!

20:50.916 --> 20:52.501
[roars]

20:57.214 --> 20:58.758
[screaming]

21:04.054 --> 21:07.057
[Lance] <i>This place is coming down!</i>
<i>Let's get out of here!</i>

21:08.851 --> 21:11.937
[Hunk] <i>Dude, you just dropped</i>
<i>a sonic boom on him!</i>

21:13.939 --> 21:18.235
[Lance] So, Blumfump, the jellyfish,
the magnetic stare, the hypnotic dance...

21:18.319 --> 21:23.115
-You got it all wrong. It was the food.
-Well, I did say they were theories.

21:23.199 --> 21:26.619
Mer-science isn't always about
getting the right answer.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.121
I want to thank you all
for what you've done.

21:29.205 --> 21:33.417
You've freed my people, and I will do
all I can to protect that freedom.

21:33.501 --> 21:38.005
I vow to be the voice of my people.
I beg of you to help.

21:38.088 --> 21:41.467
-Will you be my advisors?
-Of course, Your Highness.

21:41.550 --> 21:45.262
I have some great ideas.
Have you ever heard of electricity?

21:45.346 --> 21:48.557
And I wanted to personally
thank you, Lance.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.601
-Mwah.
-[groans]

21:50.684 --> 21:52.728
Finally, I can remove this thing.

21:57.358 --> 21:59.902
Whoa!
[moaning]

21:59.985 --> 22:02.655
Queen Luxia, the reason
we came here in the first place

22:02.738 --> 22:05.157
was to see if you could help us
find our friends.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.492
Of course.

22:07.660 --> 22:11.288
It has been many years since we have
activated the energy beacon,

22:11.372 --> 22:14.291
but perhaps it is time
to rebuild our civilization

22:14.375 --> 22:17.044
and reach out
to interstellar travelers once again.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.588
Activate energy beacon!

22:29.098 --> 22:30.391
[Pidge]
I see the beacon!

22:31.433 --> 22:34.812
There is a mer-cat in our system
that appears to be heading our way.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.105
[Hunk]
It's the Green Lion!

22:36.188 --> 22:38.649
See, Hunk? I told you they could help us.

22:38.732 --> 22:41.151
Now, the next time I go
swimming after a mermaid,

22:41.235 --> 22:43.404
I hope you won't be complaining
the whole time.

22:43.487 --> 22:44.780
Lesson learned.
