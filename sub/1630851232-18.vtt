00:04.091 --> 00:06.180
<i>- Previously</i>
<i>on "New Amsterdam"...</i>

00:06.223 --> 00:07.659
- My refugee status
is being revoked,

00:07.703 --> 00:09.009
and if I don't fight it,
I'll be sent back to Pakistan.

00:09.052 --> 00:10.488
How much do you need?

00:10.532 --> 00:12.447
- Roofies didn't put you
in that situation.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.144
You did that all on your own.

00:14.188 --> 00:15.885
- How can you--
- And that's infidelity, Iggy.

00:15.928 --> 00:18.192
Emotional infidelity.

00:18.235 --> 00:20.542
What is it?

00:20.585 --> 00:21.543
Speak...

00:21.586 --> 00:23.893
c-c-c...

00:23.936 --> 00:25.764
c-c-can't.

00:26.896 --> 00:28.550
You got this, babe.

00:28.593 --> 00:30.247
You can do it.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.206
Show those fine motor skills
who's boss.

00:47.090 --> 00:50.093
Wow, this looks incredible.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.747
Look how far you've come.

00:54.576 --> 00:57.100
Thank y...

00:57.144 --> 00:58.362
- Thank you,
are you kidding me?

00:58.406 --> 01:00.930
I'm the lucky one.
This is...

01:01.974 --> 01:04.934
And I'm hearing real
improvement in your speech.

01:04.977 --> 01:06.979
- R-r-really?

01:07.023 --> 01:08.894
- Yes, ma'am.
You know what?

01:08.938 --> 01:11.114
Before you know it,
this is all gonna be behind us,

01:11.158 --> 01:12.376
and we're gonna
be back in London.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.117
No ifs, ands, or buts.

01:16.119 --> 01:19.644
No if...

01:22.908 --> 01:26.216
And...buts.

01:26.260 --> 01:28.523
- You're getting there,
you're doing it.

01:28.566 --> 01:30.916
You're doing so great, babe.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.834
Apple.

01:38.446 --> 01:41.884
So now tell me,
"I have the apple."

01:52.503 --> 01:55.332
Apple.

01:55.376 --> 01:58.727
I have the apple.

02:03.819 --> 02:06.735
I, um...

02:11.131 --> 02:13.481
Apple.

02:17.093 --> 02:18.877
I...

02:21.619 --> 02:23.882
I...

02:26.624 --> 02:29.236
- That's two hours.

02:29.279 --> 02:30.976
Great work, Dr. Sharpe.

02:39.028 --> 02:43.337
- Well, we try not to quantify
any stroke victim's recovery.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.817
You're doing all your homework.
You're driven.

02:45.861 --> 02:47.732
That's the focus.

02:52.215 --> 02:56.132
Well, in terms of raw numbers,
your scores are lower today.

02:58.787 --> 02:59.875
Mm.

03:07.274 --> 03:09.885
It's just one day.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.241
Hey, morning.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.069
Morning.

03:20.112 --> 03:21.897
- Oh, yeah, hey,
check it out.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.812
I used our French press

03:23.855 --> 03:26.118
for the first time ever,
and I made some coffee.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.729
To the sophisticated palate,

03:27.772 --> 03:30.732
one will note hints
of chocolate and chicory.

03:30.775 --> 03:32.037
- <i>Pour toi.</i>
- Oh, thank you.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.648
Yeah, you got it.

03:34.953 --> 03:36.781
Hey, babe,

03:36.825 --> 03:38.827
our marriage is the joy
of my life--

03:38.870 --> 03:41.090
- Yeah, I gotta get to work.
- Okay, yeah.

03:41.133 --> 03:42.700
Just please, hang on.

03:42.744 --> 03:46.443
I...I have been looking
for a couples counselor.

03:46.487 --> 03:48.315
- We know all the good ones
in the city.

03:48.358 --> 03:49.925
- It won't be a neutral space.
- Right.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.970
That's why we could go
to this amazing guy

03:52.014 --> 03:54.712
that I found up in Stamford.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.410
- Stamford.
- Yeah.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.542
- It's a 40-minute drive.

03:58.586 --> 04:01.066
- I know.
So, you know, we...

04:01.110 --> 04:04.113
we listen to podcasts
and we figure out the commute

04:04.156 --> 04:05.767
and we figure out
the childcare,

04:05.810 --> 04:07.899
and we figure out all of it,
Martin, because we're worth it,

04:07.943 --> 04:09.901
aren't we?

04:09.945 --> 04:11.381
I just--

04:11.425 --> 04:13.383
I need to fix this, Martin.

04:13.427 --> 04:15.298
I need you
to help me fix this.

04:15.342 --> 04:18.127
- You know what,
put it on my iCal.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.390
Yeah, okay.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.829
Have a good day.

05:19.014 --> 05:20.232
Hey, I know I'm behind.

05:20.276 --> 05:21.538
Just go ahead
and have them start the prep

05:21.582 --> 05:23.497
for Mr. Azad and...

05:24.498 --> 05:27.022
What do you mean he cancelled?

05:28.066 --> 05:31.853
No, no, I'll...
I'll handle it.

05:31.896 --> 05:32.854
Okay.

05:34.159 --> 05:37.337
<i>Mr. Azad,</i>
<i>this surgery isn't optional.</i>

05:37.380 --> 05:38.990
<i>You have pancreatic cancer.</i>

05:39.034 --> 05:40.340
Had.

05:40.383 --> 05:42.211
You cut it out in the first
surgery, remember?

05:42.254 --> 05:45.170
- Right, right, we resected the
tumor in the primary surgery,

05:45.214 --> 05:46.998
<i>but now we need to go back in</i>
<i>to clear the margins.</i>

05:47.042 --> 05:48.957
<i>Otherwise, the cancer</i>
<i>will just come back.</i>

05:49.000 --> 05:52.003
- Always upselling, huh?
- Wait, excuse me?

05:52.047 --> 05:56.094
- After my surgery,
New Amsterdam sent me a bill

05:56.138 --> 06:00.098
for 28 grand
after my insurance paid up.

06:00.142 --> 06:03.145
- What?
Wait, what was the bill for?

06:03.188 --> 06:04.625
You.

06:04.668 --> 06:08.324
It said you were a consulting
surgeon in my case.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.066
You told me
you were in network.

06:11.109 --> 06:13.460
I-I am.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.375
Look, Mr. Azad,
I'll figure out a way

06:15.418 --> 06:18.682
to make this right, but we got
to get you in for surgery now.

06:18.726 --> 06:21.903
- Well, I guess
I can't afford to live.

06:21.946 --> 06:23.600
Consult on that.

06:32.304 --> 06:35.569
- Thanks, but I brought
my own lunch to school.

06:37.092 --> 06:40.400
- It's the first installment
of my loan repayment.

06:40.443 --> 06:43.011
$1,000.

06:43.054 --> 06:45.883
- Leyla, you didn't have to--
- I did.

06:45.927 --> 06:49.539
I'll keep paying you back
whenever I have the money to.

06:50.888 --> 06:53.282
My lawyer said a paper trail
would kill my chances

06:53.325 --> 06:54.631
at a visa, so...

06:54.675 --> 06:57.591
Cash, right.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.464
Do you wanna count it?

07:03.161 --> 07:05.425
No, I don't.

07:06.295 --> 07:08.036
I trust you.

07:10.604 --> 07:14.129
- I'll try to have more
for you next week.

07:19.613 --> 07:20.962
<i>It's Leyla.</i>

07:21.005 --> 07:23.443
Do you know what would
make the situation better?

07:23.486 --> 07:25.575
- Hm?
- Ritalin, booze.

07:25.619 --> 07:27.403
- Sex with a stranger.
- Mm.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.839
- Just so happens
that all the things

07:28.883 --> 07:31.494
that actually work on stress
are sobriety-wreckers.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.801
- What about meditation
and exercise?

07:33.844 --> 07:35.455
- Yeah, I said something
that actually works.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.022
- I mean,
there's got to be some crutch

07:38.066 --> 07:40.547
to help me deal
before I completely lose it.

07:40.590 --> 07:43.985
Oh, wait, here it is.

07:44.028 --> 07:45.508
Gum.

07:45.552 --> 07:48.032
- I found Kyle
in the elevator struggling.

07:48.076 --> 07:49.643
Diaphoretic, tachy,
tachypneic.

07:49.686 --> 07:51.383
- And, <i>madonne,</i>
the diarrhea.

07:51.427 --> 07:52.602
- All right,
let's get you to a room.

07:52.646 --> 07:54.691
- Famous Kyle's.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.258
Best calzones in the city.

07:56.301 --> 07:57.781
- Oh, that's me.
I'm famous Kyle.

07:57.825 --> 07:59.522
- Oh, no way.
- Wait, no way.

07:59.566 --> 08:00.958
That's my favorite spot
in Midtown.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.960
- Famous Kyle's Calzones
is Lower East Side.

08:03.004 --> 08:05.659
Kyle's Original Calzones
are in Midtown.

08:05.702 --> 08:08.792
And the balls on those
rip-off artist bastards

08:08.836 --> 08:12.100
for calling themselves
"original" when--

08:12.143 --> 08:14.363
- You ever had this pain before?
- No.

08:14.406 --> 08:16.147
- Okay, any medical history
I should know about?

08:16.191 --> 08:18.323
- I've got MS.
I've had it for years.

08:18.367 --> 08:20.021
It's been acting up,

08:20.064 --> 08:22.153
so I did
an immune modulator trial

08:22.197 --> 08:23.154
three days ago.

08:23.198 --> 08:25.592
- Azathioprine?
Methotrexate?

08:25.635 --> 08:28.638
It's...fecal transplant.

08:28.682 --> 08:30.466
- For MS?
Is that indicated?

08:30.510 --> 08:32.990
- No. Someone
was way out of line.

08:33.034 --> 08:35.340
I'm sorry,
where did you get this done?

08:35.384 --> 08:37.125
Downstairs.

08:37.168 --> 08:38.648
New Amsterdam.

08:38.692 --> 08:41.303
A Dr. Mia Castries.

08:43.479 --> 08:46.308
Huh.

08:46.351 --> 08:48.789
- Dude!
- Hey, hey, hey!

08:48.832 --> 08:51.226
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

08:51.269 --> 08:52.488
- Ah!
- Hey, no, okay.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.446
- Oh, my gosh!
- Close the door please.

08:54.490 --> 08:55.839
- They started it!
- Hey, hey!

08:55.883 --> 08:57.928
It doesn't matter
who started it.

08:57.972 --> 08:59.190
You can't
physically hurt somebody

08:59.234 --> 09:00.757
because you don't
like what they said.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.324
It's not what they said.

09:02.367 --> 09:05.936
It's what they did.
Isaac--Isaac dumped me.

09:05.980 --> 09:07.068
- It's his fault.
- Oh.

09:07.111 --> 09:08.460
- He started it!
- Okay, okay.

09:08.504 --> 09:09.549
I didn't know that.
I'm sorry.

09:09.592 --> 09:11.246
Heartbreak, that's rough,

09:11.289 --> 09:12.813
but you can talk to me
about it, okay?

09:12.856 --> 09:14.684
No matter how awful it gets.

09:14.728 --> 09:17.034
- The only one who's gonna
feel awful is him.

09:17.078 --> 09:18.949
I'm coming for you, you freak!

09:18.993 --> 09:22.039
- Okay, time out, time out,
time out, come on.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.651
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:29.830 --> 09:32.920
Well, looky here.
What, is it Visitor's Day?

09:32.963 --> 09:34.835
- Actually, I work here.
For Urgent Medicine.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.924
Yeah, lovely little outfit
on the sixth floor.

09:36.967 --> 09:38.839
Nice people, great benefits.

09:38.882 --> 09:41.581
- And UMI is a subcontractor,
so I can't fire you.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.887
- Cute.
- Yeah, isn't it?

09:43.931 --> 09:45.628
You know, the cutest thing
might actually be

09:45.672 --> 09:47.108
UMI's seat
on New Amsterdam's board,

09:47.151 --> 09:50.154
which I believe
meets this afternoon, right?

09:50.198 --> 09:51.852
Which is great for me
because...

09:51.895 --> 09:54.376
I got a lot to say.

09:56.508 --> 09:58.162
Hey, I'll see you there.

09:58.206 --> 09:59.686
Can't wait.

10:03.690 --> 10:06.867
Hey, in my office.

10:09.086 --> 10:11.262
- "Office"
is an ambitious word choice.

10:11.306 --> 10:14.265
- Well, underestimate me
at your own risk.

10:14.309 --> 10:16.964
I have a way to take out
our target once and for all.

10:17.007 --> 10:19.880
In 2004, there was
a huge malpractice suit.

10:19.923 --> 10:21.621
A patient died,
they settled out of court,

10:21.664 --> 10:23.623
and that NDA just expired.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.537
I can take that NDA
to the board

10:25.581 --> 10:27.627
and blow the lid
off this thing.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.759
- We can't.
- I mean, I don't want to

10:29.803 --> 10:31.587
use it either,
but what choice do we have?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.458
- I mean, we can't because
the board's already heard it.

10:33.502 --> 10:35.678
Veronica told the story
at her job interview.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.288
Took full responsibility.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.682
That's what
great politicians do,

10:39.726 --> 10:41.379
turn weakness into strength.

10:41.423 --> 10:43.251
What they don't do
is show up at the OK Corral

10:43.294 --> 10:47.124
at High Noon
with an empty gun.

10:47.168 --> 10:49.866
We still have
the element of surprise.

10:49.910 --> 10:51.825
At least she doesn't
know we're coming for her.

10:55.393 --> 10:57.744
Yeah, well, about that,

10:57.787 --> 11:00.921
she kind of knows.

11:05.186 --> 11:08.145
- Is this your office?
- Rude.

11:08.189 --> 11:10.017
- Patient Oren Azad
got handed

11:10.060 --> 11:12.584
an unjustified bill
from New Amsterdam.

11:12.628 --> 11:15.544
Not only is it unjustified,
it is intentionally predatory.

11:15.587 --> 11:16.893
Well, did he talk to billing?

11:16.937 --> 11:18.373
Sometimes they can
help negotiate that down.

11:18.416 --> 11:20.070
- He did,
and that's where he found out

11:20.114 --> 11:21.724
it was already
referred to collections.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.683
- Yeah, where he can
fight it in court

11:23.726 --> 11:25.075
with a bunch of money
he doesn't have.

11:25.119 --> 11:27.469
- Exactly. But since
you are always the Mozart

11:27.512 --> 11:30.167
of helping people not pay,
I thought maybe a little

11:30.211 --> 11:31.603
"Goodwin special sauce" might--

11:31.647 --> 11:33.736
- Floyd.
- Oh, I like that face.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.738
That's a classic
"Max brings justice

11:35.782 --> 11:37.261
to the people" face
right there.

11:37.305 --> 11:38.872
This is it.

11:38.915 --> 11:41.352
This is what's gonna
finally bring Veronica down.

11:44.921 --> 11:45.356
.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.055
- You know, when somebody
breaks up with you,

11:48.098 --> 11:51.232
it is perfectly natural to feel
a whole well of emotion--

11:51.275 --> 11:52.842
sadness, loss...

11:52.886 --> 11:54.496
Revenge.

11:54.539 --> 11:57.847
The desire to make his pathetic
life an ever-living hell.

11:57.891 --> 12:02.809
- Sure, yeah, that's an emotion
one could feel, yeah.

12:02.852 --> 12:06.116
Why do you think
you're feeling that?

12:06.160 --> 12:08.031
- Because I-I liked him.

12:08.075 --> 12:10.033
I spent my first kiss on him.

12:10.077 --> 12:12.035
Oh.

12:12.079 --> 12:13.341
How was it?

12:13.384 --> 12:15.038
Good?

12:15.082 --> 12:17.301
But then I got confused,

12:17.345 --> 12:19.782
'cause I know
I don't feel things the way

12:19.826 --> 12:21.523
- other people feel things.
- Sure.

12:21.566 --> 12:24.134
- So I decided
I should test it.

12:24.178 --> 12:26.136
- You decided to test it?
How?

12:26.180 --> 12:28.008
- I kissed every other boy
on the inpatient floor

12:28.051 --> 12:29.879
to see how those kisses
made me feel.

12:29.923 --> 12:31.359
Ah.

12:31.402 --> 12:33.535
- And none of them even came
close to kissing Isaac.

12:33.578 --> 12:35.755
His kiss was...different.

12:35.798 --> 12:38.322
I don't know.
He made me feel something.

12:38.366 --> 12:41.108
- Hmm.
- But then he found out.

12:41.151 --> 12:42.805
He should have been happy.

12:42.849 --> 12:45.155
The test proved
his kiss was the best one,

12:45.199 --> 12:48.245
but instead he dumped me

12:48.289 --> 12:50.639
in front of everyone.

12:50.682 --> 12:52.902
And now he's gonna pay.

12:54.295 --> 12:55.905
Did you ever consider

12:55.949 --> 12:59.213
that Isaac might feel another
emotion other than happiness,

12:59.256 --> 13:00.910
after he learned
about the kissing?

13:09.223 --> 13:12.966
If you...hurt a person

13:13.009 --> 13:17.057
that you really like,
even by accident,

13:17.100 --> 13:20.495
can you ever get them back?

13:22.671 --> 13:25.021
Well, all you can do is try.

13:31.549 --> 13:33.900
Mmm, yeah.

13:33.943 --> 13:36.467
And worth coming to
the sixth floor for, huh?

13:36.511 --> 13:37.817
I love this place.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.644
- Best calzones in Brooklyn.
- Oh, yeah.

13:39.688 --> 13:42.604
- No, no, no,
Brooklyn is Classic Kyle's.

13:42.647 --> 13:44.824
Midtown is Original Kyle's.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.043
Famous Kyle's--
the only real Kyle's--

13:47.087 --> 13:49.045
- is Lower East Side.
- All right, thanks, Kyle.

13:49.089 --> 13:50.568
How hard is this?

13:50.612 --> 13:53.484
- Hey, I just heard that
Kyle Vincenzi came back in.

13:53.528 --> 13:55.138
- How's he doing?
- Oh, yeah.

13:55.182 --> 13:56.487
He's doing much better

13:56.531 --> 13:59.839
since I pushed
broad-spectrum antibiotics...

13:59.882 --> 14:03.494
to reverse your unindicated
and dangerous FMT.

14:03.538 --> 14:05.670
- Oh, I think you'll see that
it was indicated,

14:05.714 --> 14:07.150
just not by his MS.

14:07.194 --> 14:09.326
His neuroimmune issues,
his weight issues,

14:09.370 --> 14:10.632
his compulsive behaviors--

14:10.675 --> 14:13.069
they all suggest
a maladaptive gut biome.

14:13.113 --> 14:15.680
- Right, well,
Kyle is my patient now,

14:15.724 --> 14:18.335
so I am gonna treat him
with traditional medicine.

14:18.379 --> 14:19.641
- No, that's what
I've been doing.

14:19.684 --> 14:22.513
- No, what you do
is alternative medicine.

14:22.557 --> 14:24.689
What I do
is traditional medicine.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.430
- No, what you do
is modern medicine.

14:26.474 --> 14:29.520
- Okay, um, I wanna say
awful things to you right now--

14:29.564 --> 14:31.218
I mean, like, way worse
than I've already said--

14:31.261 --> 14:33.002
but I know
that it's not okay

14:33.046 --> 14:34.961
to rip someone's head off
and jump down their throat

14:35.004 --> 14:37.050
just because you disagree
on a diagnosis.

14:37.093 --> 14:39.400
Unfortunately,
I haven't found a better way

14:39.443 --> 14:40.923
to deal
with my negative emotion,

14:40.967 --> 14:44.318
so I suggest you leave very,
very quickly.

14:44.361 --> 14:46.537
I like hot yoga

14:46.581 --> 14:48.888
and a week of a honey elixir
and leafy greens.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.977
- Thank you.
- Feel better.

15:06.644 --> 15:09.038
- Mr. Azad.
- I got nothing to say to you.

15:09.082 --> 15:12.041
- Well, I just came
for a detail.

15:12.085 --> 15:14.565
- You came to me for a detail?
- Yeah.

15:14.609 --> 15:17.394
The, uh, gold package
with the hand wax

15:17.438 --> 15:19.179
should do her right.

15:20.006 --> 15:23.574
- You left in the original V8,
or you chrome it out?

15:23.618 --> 15:26.186
- You know,
I'm not much of a car nut.

15:26.229 --> 15:27.883
With a car like this?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.493
- Oh, yeah,
this belonged to my dad.

15:29.537 --> 15:30.712
You know, he, uh...

15:30.755 --> 15:32.757
I don't have too
many memories of him,

15:32.801 --> 15:35.499
but him showing me
how to clean a car right--

15:35.543 --> 15:37.588
that was one.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.982
- Look, doc, I appreciate
the business,

15:40.026 --> 15:43.551
but I'm still not coming in
for the surgery.

15:43.594 --> 15:46.684
- Look, Mr. Azad,
the surgery's on the house.

15:46.728 --> 15:51.385
No, in fact,
if you get charged one dime,

15:51.428 --> 15:53.691
you get the car.

16:06.313 --> 16:08.489
With me.

16:16.801 --> 16:19.065
You're doing great.

16:19.108 --> 16:22.677
- N-n-not gr...

16:24.418 --> 16:26.072
Helen,

16:26.115 --> 16:29.684
I have seen patients
with your aphasia recover.

16:31.686 --> 16:34.994
I-it can happen any moment.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.648
This beautiful
breakthrough where...

16:40.825 --> 16:43.741
slides right off the tongue,

16:43.785 --> 16:46.614
and your language skills
come flooding back.

16:46.657 --> 16:50.313
That moment could happen
for you right now,

16:50.357 --> 16:52.924
or in a week, or in a year.

16:53.882 --> 16:57.799
I hope it's soon, but, Helen,

16:57.842 --> 17:00.758
you have a mountain to climb.

17:00.802 --> 17:03.544
You're not climbing badly.

17:03.587 --> 17:05.894
You're just climbing.

17:10.986 --> 17:13.249
I've also seen a lot
of benefits

17:13.293 --> 17:16.209
from bringing a partner
to the sessions.

17:16.252 --> 17:19.299
This afternoon,
why don't you bring Max?

17:24.913 --> 17:26.958
- So Reynolds came to me
with this egregious case

17:27.002 --> 17:28.656
of overcharging,
and I looked into it.

17:28.699 --> 17:30.527
It's everywhere.

17:30.571 --> 17:32.007
Veronica
is overcharging patients

17:32.051 --> 17:33.661
and then threatening them
with court

17:33.704 --> 17:35.184
before their stitches
are even out.

17:35.228 --> 17:37.926
Oren Azad wasn't an accident.
He's the plan.

17:37.969 --> 17:39.841
- She'll claim she's doing
what every hospital does.

17:39.884 --> 17:41.277
Yeah, but how much?

17:41.321 --> 17:43.975
Right now, Veronica's
an industry leader in greed.

17:44.019 --> 17:46.369
- The board likes money.
They won't care if it's dirty.

17:46.413 --> 17:48.371
No, but the world will.

17:48.415 --> 17:50.895
- You want to go public,
force the board's hand?

17:50.939 --> 17:53.072
You tell the world
what you just told me,

17:53.115 --> 17:55.335
and the hospital's reputation
will be in tatters.

17:55.378 --> 17:57.337
We'll be synonymous with greed,
poor care,

17:57.380 --> 17:58.729
and we may never recover.

17:58.773 --> 18:01.123
So I need to be sure
you understand

18:01.167 --> 18:03.082
you'd be taking down
New Amsterdam.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.866
- It may be the only way
to save it.

18:11.394 --> 18:11.568
.

18:11.612 --> 18:12.656
Hi.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.617
Big, fat scam right there.
Enjoy.

18:16.660 --> 18:19.924
New Amsterdam is robbing you,
putting profits over patients.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.622
Boycott New Amsterdam today.

18:21.665 --> 18:23.885
Here you go.

18:23.928 --> 18:26.540
- New Amsterdam charges
60 bucks for a Band-Aid?

18:26.583 --> 18:28.281
- Well, that's just
for the little ones.

18:28.324 --> 18:29.673
Imagine what
the regular-sized ones cost.

18:29.717 --> 18:31.588
Urgent Medicine,
however, is different.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.590
Sixth floor.
Come by anytime.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.252
- Hi there.
- Hello.

18:43.296 --> 18:45.602
- Would you like a flyer?
- I'm good, actually.

18:45.646 --> 18:47.735
You know,
you can't project graphics

18:47.778 --> 18:49.302
onto the real estate
of the people

18:49.345 --> 18:50.868
that you're slandering.

18:50.912 --> 18:54.089
- Well, it's only slander
if it's not, uh, true.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.438
- What do you think
I'm gonna do?

18:55.482 --> 18:57.223
I'm just gonna go cower
in my office

18:57.266 --> 18:59.225
or resign in shame?

18:59.268 --> 19:01.923
This isn't going to
accomplish anything, Max.

19:01.966 --> 19:04.360
- Have you checked your
surgical cancellations lately?

19:04.404 --> 19:06.797
'Cause I think we just
picked up 11 of your patients,

19:06.841 --> 19:08.843
and thanks to them,
the world is gonna hear

19:08.886 --> 19:11.324
all about what you've
turned this place into,

19:11.367 --> 19:13.108
and so will the board.

19:17.286 --> 19:19.680
There you go. Enjoy.

19:19.723 --> 19:22.248
And that's...

19:22.291 --> 19:26.208
that's why I'm so sorry, Isaac.

19:26.252 --> 19:29.690
I'm the most sorry
I've ever been

19:29.733 --> 19:31.561
in my entire life.

19:31.605 --> 19:33.215
I know what you're doing.

19:33.259 --> 19:35.696
- Isaac--
- No, she does this, Dr. Frome.

19:35.739 --> 19:37.741
- Juliet's disorder
does make it harder

19:37.785 --> 19:39.482
for her to connect
with other people.

19:39.526 --> 19:42.268
- She had no problem connecting
with everybody else

19:42.311 --> 19:44.618
on the floor behind my back.

19:44.661 --> 19:46.794
- You said
an apology would work.

19:46.837 --> 19:48.796
- No, I didn't.
I said that it was worth a try,

19:48.839 --> 19:52.278
and I never said
it was a guarantee.

19:52.321 --> 19:54.758
- You really
want the truth, Isaac?

19:54.802 --> 19:56.934
You really want honesty?

19:56.978 --> 19:59.502
I guess.

19:59.546 --> 20:04.551
- When we kissed,
I felt like I was gonna...

20:04.594 --> 20:06.335
throw up.

20:06.379 --> 20:10.121
No, but like--
like good...throw up.

20:10.165 --> 20:11.514
I-I don't...

20:11.558 --> 20:16.084
I don't know how else
to describe it, but...

20:16.127 --> 20:18.173
I really liked that feeling.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.437
And I don't want to
lose it or you.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.528
Okay, good, thank you.

20:25.572 --> 20:28.401
Um, Isaac, Juliet has shared
her truth with you,

20:28.444 --> 20:30.925
and I wonder if you might
share yours with her,

20:30.968 --> 20:33.319
even if it's hard.

20:35.712 --> 20:37.932
- I don't wanna
lose you either.

20:39.499 --> 20:41.631
Kissing you felt--well,

20:41.675 --> 20:44.939
not like throwing up exactly,
but...

20:44.982 --> 20:47.246
definitely a stomach thing.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.160
Like...

20:49.204 --> 20:51.337
like being
on a roller coaster.

20:52.381 --> 20:54.949
I kinda feel it right now.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.220
Aw.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.569
- Oh, my God,
mind your business.

21:06.613 --> 21:08.223
- You're right.
I'm sorry, my bad.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.530
As you were.

21:13.402 --> 21:16.449
- Hey.
Hello, gorgeous.

21:16.492 --> 21:18.494
How's therapy going?

21:20.279 --> 21:21.758
Come on.
I'm sure you're crushing it.

21:21.802 --> 21:23.325
You're gonna be doing
Shakespeare in the Park

21:23.369 --> 21:25.284
in no time.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.983
You wanna say something.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.426
- J-just...

21:38.732 --> 21:40.255
H-hi.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.301
Hi.

21:42.344 --> 21:44.303
Love you.

21:47.915 --> 21:49.656
You got this.

21:55.401 --> 21:58.099
- He's tachy and hypotensive.

21:58.142 --> 21:59.405
It's anaphylactic shock.

21:59.448 --> 22:02.364
- Hit him with EPI sub Q.
- On it.

22:02.408 --> 22:03.670
- He must be having
an allergic reaction

22:03.713 --> 22:05.411
to the antibiotics we gave him.

22:05.454 --> 22:07.848
Come on, Kyle.
Come on.

22:07.891 --> 22:10.024
- Okay, BP's rising.
- Heart rate's slowing.

22:10.067 --> 22:13.462
- Okay, you had a bad reaction
Kyle, but you're gonna be okay.

22:13.506 --> 22:14.724
Look at his legs.

22:14.768 --> 22:16.683
That's not
an allergic reaction.

22:16.726 --> 22:19.033
- 2 milligrams of Ativan IV.
- That's not gonna help his MS.

22:19.076 --> 22:20.600
- I don't think
he's got MS at all.

22:20.643 --> 22:23.429
Come on, Kyle, come on.

22:24.299 --> 22:25.822
Spleen fully retracted.

22:25.866 --> 22:28.564
And with that,

22:28.608 --> 22:30.305
the midline margins
of the tumor are clear.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.828
Bravo.

22:31.872 --> 22:34.831
- Let's investigate the
posterior margins on the tail.

22:34.875 --> 22:37.007
Throw us
a little bit more light.

22:40.141 --> 22:42.404
Wait, let me see here...

22:42.448 --> 22:45.102
Damn it!
More tumor remnants.

22:45.146 --> 22:47.496
- Right up against
his superior mesenteric artery.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.629
- If we resect
and the tumor's eroded in,

22:49.672 --> 22:51.195
he'll bleed out in seconds.

22:51.239 --> 22:53.633
We need to get a vascular
surgeon in here to attack that.

22:53.676 --> 22:55.112
- Call in
one of New Amsterdam's.

22:55.156 --> 22:57.071
- His insurance only covers
one consulting surgeon.

22:57.114 --> 22:58.638
New Amsterdam
is out of his network.

22:58.681 --> 23:01.641
- He's gonna get slapped
with a huge bill.

23:01.684 --> 23:04.121
- Well, if we don't get
a specialist in here fast,

23:04.165 --> 23:06.689
he won't be alive to see it.

23:08.474 --> 23:10.301
- Hey, Dr. Christy.
How are my fricatives?

23:10.345 --> 23:12.086
- Exquisite.
You ready to go?

23:12.129 --> 23:14.131
- Ready for...
- For Helen's therapy.

23:14.175 --> 23:16.307
I decided this morning
that you should be there.

23:16.351 --> 23:19.572
- Oh, uh...I'd love that,
but she...

23:19.615 --> 23:21.051
she didn't invite me.

23:21.095 --> 23:23.445
- Well, I'm sure she will
when she sees you.

23:29.712 --> 23:30.017
.

23:33.890 --> 23:35.501
Hey.

23:35.544 --> 23:39.026
I heard you
weren't in art class today.

23:39.069 --> 23:41.071
She dumped me.

23:42.203 --> 23:44.858
Oof, that's rough.

23:45.554 --> 23:49.471
You know, God knows
that affairs of the heart

23:49.515 --> 23:51.821
almost never go
the way we planned.

23:51.865 --> 23:54.476
- This went exactly
how she planned.

23:54.520 --> 23:57.697
She tricked me back and then
humiliated me on purpose.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.350
I'm so stupid.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.178
- Well, Isaac,
are we sure that--

24:01.222 --> 24:02.353
This was an attack.

24:02.397 --> 24:03.964
She waited till
everybody on the floor

24:04.007 --> 24:05.356
was gathered for group,

24:05.400 --> 24:06.793
and then she
stood up on a chair

24:06.836 --> 24:08.447
and yelled
that she was dumping me.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.100
Yeah.

24:10.971 --> 24:12.712
Yeah, that's pretty terrible.

24:12.755 --> 24:15.628
- And she said she was
dumping me because I was gross

24:15.671 --> 24:19.240
and that I kiss like
I'm spitting into her mouth.

24:19.283 --> 24:23.331
And that my breath
smells like armpits.

24:23.374 --> 24:26.247
She said she wanted
to get back together.

24:26.290 --> 24:28.467
Why would she do this?

24:35.082 --> 24:37.171
- This is Dr. Reynolds
at New Amsterdam.

24:37.214 --> 24:41.044
Yes, I'm in need
of a vascular surgeon.

24:41.088 --> 24:43.569
I know it's last-minute,
but, uh...

24:44.874 --> 24:46.963
Yeah, I see. Um...

24:47.007 --> 24:48.878
Do you know
of anyone else I can call?

24:55.102 --> 24:56.886
You're the only one
in Lower Manhattan.

24:58.627 --> 24:59.933
Right.

24:59.976 --> 25:03.806
Okay, no Gold PPO,
but how about Silver?

25:03.850 --> 25:06.243
Bronze? Any other metal?

25:06.287 --> 25:08.811
No, yeah--he's open
on the table right now.

25:08.855 --> 25:10.552
I'm looking at the man's liver.

25:10.596 --> 25:14.425
Hi. You don't know me,
but I know your boyfriend's

25:14.469 --> 25:16.384
sister's husband,
and they told me that--

25:16.427 --> 25:18.821
<i>Wait, I'm desperate here.</i>

25:18.865 --> 25:20.519
And I know it's bullcrap

25:20.562 --> 25:22.695
that the only way
to save a man's life

25:22.738 --> 25:24.174
without bankrupting him

25:24.218 --> 25:26.916
is me cold-calling strangers,

25:26.960 --> 25:28.396
but you're a doctor in America,

25:28.439 --> 25:30.920
so I know you've been
standing where I am right now

25:30.964 --> 25:32.705
and I'm asking you
doctor to doctor,

25:32.748 --> 25:35.925
human to human,
to just drop everything

25:35.969 --> 25:38.537
and save this guy's life.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.103
Please.

25:41.452 --> 25:45.631
Yeah, yeah, sure,
if something opens up.

25:45.674 --> 25:47.241
Okay.

26:05.825 --> 26:09.480
- Okay, Kyle, I just want you
to take some deep breaths

26:09.524 --> 26:13.354
and try to relax as the toxins
are leaving your body.

26:16.183 --> 26:17.837
You can't steal from me.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.360
I took a calzone.

26:19.403 --> 26:21.797
- My patient.
It is unacceptable.

26:21.841 --> 26:23.886
I'm upstairs trying
to figure out a diagnosis,

26:23.930 --> 26:26.323
and you're down here laying
a tea party out on his back.

26:26.367 --> 26:27.760
- It's called cupping.
- Yeah.

26:27.803 --> 26:30.240
Well, what it is not
called is medicine.

26:30.284 --> 26:31.633
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't

26:31.677 --> 26:32.765
report you to the board.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.114
- 'Cause I didn't
steal your patient.

26:34.157 --> 26:35.768
He requested
to be transferred to me.

26:35.811 --> 26:37.508
Why would he do that?

26:37.552 --> 26:39.206
- Because his doctors
keep trying to figure out

26:39.249 --> 26:40.903
if he has this kind of MS
or that kind of infection,

26:40.947 --> 26:42.644
and all he wants
is to feel better.

26:42.688 --> 26:46.169
But I have some good news.
The tea party is working.

26:46.213 --> 26:48.215
It's triggering
some muscle relaxation,

26:48.258 --> 26:50.609
and he's actually feeling
really good right now.

26:52.698 --> 26:55.135
That is good news.

26:55.178 --> 26:56.615
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.921
It's not like you
ripped my head off

26:58.965 --> 27:01.837
and spat down my throat
just because we disagreed.

27:01.881 --> 27:03.317
Wait.

27:04.666 --> 27:05.667
Um...

27:07.234 --> 27:09.802
I've had a really hard stretch.

27:09.845 --> 27:11.455
And, uh...

27:11.499 --> 27:14.633
the things that I used to
rely on to get me through...

27:16.939 --> 27:18.201
Well, they're, um...

27:18.245 --> 27:19.942
turns out
they're not so sustainable.

27:19.986 --> 27:22.815
So I'm lashing out.

27:23.598 --> 27:25.905
I guess I need a new crutch.

27:25.948 --> 27:29.169
Not doing so hot
with the old ones.

27:29.212 --> 27:31.737
Do you know what a crutch is?

27:31.780 --> 27:33.782
I think so.

27:33.826 --> 27:35.566
But you know what,
I've embarrassed myself enough.

27:35.610 --> 27:38.091
So I'm gonna let you tell me.

27:38.134 --> 27:39.658
It's leaning on something

27:39.701 --> 27:41.703
instead of fixing
what's really wrong.

27:41.747 --> 27:47.404
And I only know that because
that was me for a long time.

27:47.448 --> 27:49.755
But, the big irony is,

27:49.798 --> 27:52.061
you think
you're skipping the feelings,

27:52.105 --> 27:54.934
but you're
just prolonging them.

27:54.977 --> 27:58.677
They're still in there
waiting to be let out.

28:04.987 --> 28:07.076
I think the toxins
came out.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.599
What is that?

28:08.643 --> 28:11.646
- That is the best calzone
on the Lower East Side.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.170
I think I know
what's really wrong with him.

28:15.911 --> 28:19.480
Ifs...

28:22.831 --> 28:25.921
N...

28:25.965 --> 28:28.141
no...

28:29.620 --> 28:33.624
But...buts.

28:34.408 --> 28:36.715
- Hey.
- Hi.

28:36.758 --> 28:38.760
W-why...

28:38.804 --> 28:43.591
- Oh, yeah, you weren't
answering my texts, and...

28:43.634 --> 28:44.984
Oh, yeah, sorry.

28:45.027 --> 28:46.550
You're in the zone.
I get it.

28:46.594 --> 28:48.727
But your doctor, I bumped
into her in the hallway.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.685
I think
she wanted me to be here.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.687
Mm.

28:54.820 --> 28:57.344
You, um...

29:00.216 --> 29:01.827
Bus...y.

29:01.870 --> 29:05.395
- No, no, I'm not too busy
for you ever.

29:05.439 --> 29:07.789
Come on,
let's get in there.

29:09.095 --> 29:10.444
Go.

29:10.487 --> 29:12.576
- Go?
Why?

29:14.100 --> 29:16.319
Go.

29:16.363 --> 29:18.495
- Helen,
I don't presume to understand

29:18.539 --> 29:20.671
what you're going through,
but I am trying.

29:20.715 --> 29:23.762
And your doctor wants me--
I wanna be here, okay?

29:23.805 --> 29:26.590
I wanna be here
to support you.

29:26.634 --> 29:28.201
You...

29:28.244 --> 29:31.987
no...

29:32.031 --> 29:34.207
mm.

29:36.557 --> 29:39.778
- S...port.
- How can you say that?

29:39.821 --> 29:43.825
You no...

29:45.392 --> 29:47.176
S-s-see m--

29:47.220 --> 29:48.917
I don't see you?

29:48.961 --> 29:51.833
What are you talking about?
Of course I see you.

29:57.012 --> 30:00.015
W-w-what...

30:00.059 --> 30:02.975
you...

30:03.018 --> 30:05.978
s-s-see?

30:06.021 --> 30:08.850
- I see the most incredible
person I've ever seen.

30:08.894 --> 30:12.114
I see someone who's strong
and amazing and brave.

30:18.207 --> 30:21.863
- Fail.
- No, no, don't say that.

30:21.907 --> 30:24.170
- B-broken.
- You're not broken, Helen.

30:24.213 --> 30:25.475
That's ridiculous.

30:25.519 --> 30:28.130
You're not broken.
You're not broken.

30:28.174 --> 30:32.047
You...

30:32.091 --> 30:34.049
see...

30:34.093 --> 30:35.834
mm...

30:41.927 --> 30:43.624
Perfect.

30:45.452 --> 30:48.411
- I love you.
I love you.

30:48.455 --> 30:51.327
And I'm always
gonna love you, even if--

30:52.372 --> 30:55.723
- N-not...

30:55.766 --> 30:57.856
better...

30:57.899 --> 31:00.336
E--hm.

31:00.380 --> 31:03.731
Ev--ever?

31:03.774 --> 31:06.429
- Mm-hmm.

31:06.473 --> 31:08.692
- Say--
- I'm still gonna love you.

31:08.736 --> 31:10.216
No matter what,
doesn't matter.

31:10.259 --> 31:11.870
Even if--

31:13.393 --> 31:18.093
Even if.
But...you will get better.

31:18.137 --> 31:20.008
I'm not giving up on that.

31:21.967 --> 31:23.969
Are you?

31:27.973 --> 31:29.539
You two ready?

31:35.545 --> 31:39.027
Lea...ving.

31:53.215 --> 31:53.433
.

31:53.476 --> 31:56.827
- And Mr. Azad's margins
are clear.

31:56.871 --> 31:59.178
- Dr. Loh,
you are a literal lifesaver.

31:59.221 --> 32:02.094
- Thank God Floyd got to you.
- It was a near miss.

32:02.137 --> 32:04.705
I had a conflict,
but he's covering for me,

32:04.748 --> 32:06.446
so it all worked out.

32:06.489 --> 32:08.274
What was the conflict?

32:08.317 --> 32:10.885
- "Flowers for Algernon."
What a book.

32:13.757 --> 32:15.150
Yes?

32:15.194 --> 32:17.457
- What were the flowers
supposed to symbolize?

32:18.849 --> 32:21.548
Right, uh...

32:22.853 --> 32:24.290
Celiac disease?

32:24.333 --> 32:25.813
Yeah.

32:25.856 --> 32:27.423
Yes.

32:27.467 --> 32:29.208
- Not MS?
- No.

32:29.251 --> 32:31.993
- But my famous calzones...
- Are making you sick.

32:32.037 --> 32:34.343
- But not because
they're not delicious.

32:34.387 --> 32:35.866
It's the gluten.
Your immune system

32:35.910 --> 32:37.390
is treating it as a threat.

32:37.433 --> 32:39.827
- The inflammation it's
causing is what's triggering

32:39.870 --> 32:42.177
your numbness,
weakness, the rashes--

32:42.221 --> 32:45.833
symptoms almost always
associated with MS.

32:45.876 --> 32:48.009
I'm so sorry, Kyle.

32:48.053 --> 32:50.229
- Why would you be sorry
that he doesn't have MS?

32:50.272 --> 32:51.621
'Cause it's hard to accept

32:51.665 --> 32:54.233
when something you love
is hurting you.

32:54.276 --> 32:56.409
- Are you kidding?
It's great.

32:56.452 --> 32:58.454
I finally have a way
to put daylight

32:58.498 --> 33:01.283
between me
and those other Kyles.

33:01.327 --> 33:03.546
Gluten-free calzones.

33:03.590 --> 33:06.114
It sounds so classy I'll be
able to charge whatever I want.

33:14.993 --> 33:19.040
- Hey, great job
on that diagnosis.

33:23.175 --> 33:27.092
- Something I love
is hurting me.

33:27.135 --> 33:30.356
I'm just not really sure
how to let it out.

33:33.098 --> 33:35.535
How can I help?

33:45.110 --> 33:47.547
- Juliet, come on.
I know you're in there.

33:47.590 --> 33:50.724
We need to talk about
what you did to Isaac.

33:50.767 --> 33:52.465
Fine.

33:54.989 --> 33:57.078
Just get it over with.

33:57.122 --> 33:59.211
- Look,
I know that he hurt you,

33:59.254 --> 34:01.039
and I know that that stings.

34:01.082 --> 34:04.390
But that does not give you
the right to hurt him back,

34:04.433 --> 34:06.218
no matter how bad you want to.

34:06.261 --> 34:08.829
No, no,
that's not gonna work on me.

34:08.872 --> 34:12.093
- I'm not trying to do it!
They just keep coming.

34:12.137 --> 34:16.054
They won't stop.
It's so annoying!

34:16.097 --> 34:18.012
What is happening?

34:18.056 --> 34:19.927
- I think that
it's because deep down,

34:19.970 --> 34:22.364
you still care a lot
for Isaac.

34:22.408 --> 34:24.627
- Well, duh.
Of course I do.

34:24.671 --> 34:28.370
- Why do you think
you hurt him then?

34:28.414 --> 34:32.026
- I was really, really happy
when we got back together.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.376
And I thought
everything was gonna be

34:34.420 --> 34:37.727
the same as it was before.

34:37.771 --> 34:40.034
But he was different with me.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.644
He was distant,

34:41.688 --> 34:47.346
and I knew it was only a matter
of time before I got dumped.

34:49.261 --> 34:52.002
So I wanted to win

34:52.046 --> 34:53.787
before I lost again.

34:53.830 --> 34:56.137
Hmm.

34:56.181 --> 34:58.879
Wow, that must
have felt strange...

34:58.922 --> 35:01.055
first time winning felt bad.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.666
It's my own fault.

35:03.710 --> 35:05.799
How so?

35:05.842 --> 35:08.454
- I'm callous-unemotional.

35:08.497 --> 35:12.458
I'm not supposed to be happy
with someone else.

35:12.501 --> 35:15.374
I'm clinically predisposed
to be alone,

35:15.417 --> 35:18.159
and these feelings prove it.

35:18.203 --> 35:22.120
- Holy moly, did you ever
get this one wrong.

35:23.599 --> 35:26.036
- You making fun of me?
- No.

35:26.080 --> 35:29.301
Feeling like
you're doomed to be alone?

35:29.344 --> 35:31.129
That you screwed things up
so badly

35:31.172 --> 35:32.478
with the one person for you

35:32.521 --> 35:34.480
that you're never
gonna be happy again?

35:34.523 --> 35:36.395
These are big emotions
that everyone feels

35:36.438 --> 35:38.353
when they get broken up with.

35:38.397 --> 35:40.877
Juliet, these are
the most recognizable emotions

35:40.921 --> 35:42.357
you've ever shared with me.

35:42.401 --> 35:43.663
Really?

35:43.706 --> 35:45.708
Yes, really.

35:47.493 --> 35:51.105
But you know what I think
these tears mean?

35:51.149 --> 35:53.238
I think they mean
you're getting better.

35:57.372 --> 36:01.202
- I move to immediately
dismiss Veronica Fuentes

36:01.246 --> 36:02.899
as Medical Director
of New Amsterdam.

36:02.943 --> 36:04.771
Can I get a second?

36:07.165 --> 36:09.645
- Hi--
You started without me?

36:09.689 --> 36:11.691
- Hi, everybody.
- Veronica, welcome.

36:11.734 --> 36:15.085
You are just in time to take
a vote on your termination.

36:15.129 --> 36:17.697
Mm, shame.

36:17.740 --> 36:22.397
Well, I guess I could just
make it easier on everybody

36:22.441 --> 36:25.400
and hand in my resignation.

36:25.444 --> 36:27.402
Wow, that would be great.

36:27.446 --> 36:29.361
But before I do that,

36:29.404 --> 36:32.233
I would like to make
one final proposal.

36:32.277 --> 36:35.845
I would like to acquire
Urgent Medicine Inc.

36:35.889 --> 36:39.545
You see, there's this little
buyout option in the contract,

36:39.588 --> 36:42.548
and call me crazy,
but Max's very weird

36:42.591 --> 36:45.290
and rather ugly
grandstanding today

36:45.333 --> 36:49.424
actually created
a beautiful opportunity for us.

36:49.468 --> 36:54.124
But I want to be very clear--
this is not just a PR win.

36:54.168 --> 36:57.389
This is a huge
financial gain for us

36:57.432 --> 37:00.218
because once we bring back
our former patients,

37:00.261 --> 37:02.089
plus UMI's,

37:02.132 --> 37:05.310
we will be netting
approximately--ooh, let's see,

37:05.353 --> 37:10.228
hmm, maybe about
$3 million a month,

37:10.271 --> 37:12.447
give or take.

37:13.143 --> 37:18.714
I'm sorry, I--who
still wants me to resign?

37:30.378 --> 37:33.773
What happened?

37:33.816 --> 37:36.819
- How do you beat
greed personified?

37:38.604 --> 37:41.302
You give her something to buy.

37:41.346 --> 37:43.435
- She took the bait?
She bought UMI?

37:43.478 --> 37:45.741
- Veronica just bought herself
a Trojan horse.

37:45.785 --> 37:47.308
We are in.

38:23.779 --> 38:25.564
Ignatius Frome?

38:25.607 --> 38:29.045
- Yes, hi.
Iggy, just call me Iggy.

38:29.089 --> 38:31.091
Is your husband joining us?

38:31.134 --> 38:33.572
No, no, I told him not to.

38:33.615 --> 38:35.965
You know,
I was making this about us,

38:36.009 --> 38:38.751
and I think it's really me
that has the work to do, so...

38:38.794 --> 38:40.492
This way.

39:05.430 --> 39:08.041
- You know,
I wouldn't have taken your car.

39:08.084 --> 39:10.435
Why not?

39:10.478 --> 39:12.524
It was your father's.

39:38.114 --> 39:39.899
Hi, I'm, uh,

39:39.942 --> 39:42.031
trying to track down
an employee

39:42.075 --> 39:43.685
who worked there some time ago.

39:55.305 --> 39:57.351
Hey.

40:07.709 --> 40:10.277
"I should have let you
come to my session."

40:12.192 --> 40:17.110
"I was ashamed and embarrassed

40:17.153 --> 40:20.461
"and scared.

40:20.505 --> 40:23.464
"But this is where I am.

40:23.508 --> 40:26.554
This is my journey."

40:33.474 --> 40:37.086
- W-w-will...

40:37.130 --> 40:40.699
y-y-you...

40:40.742 --> 40:42.048
cuh--

40:42.091 --> 40:44.006
- Always.
- ...come?

40:44.050 --> 40:46.052
No ifs, ands, or buts.

40:46.095 --> 40:49.490
Say it with me.
Come on.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.361
- Now?
- Yeah.

40:51.405 --> 40:52.624
Now, come on.
We'll make it fun.

40:52.667 --> 40:54.190
It'll be like
a strip poker version.

40:54.234 --> 40:55.627
Ready? Here we go.

40:55.670 --> 40:59.500
No ifs, ands, or buts.
Your turn.

41:00.849 --> 41:03.417
No...

41:03.461 --> 41:05.985
ifs...

41:06.028 --> 41:07.726
nan--

41:07.769 --> 41:09.597
- And, no, sorry.
That's a mistake.

41:09.641 --> 41:10.990
So that's gonna
cost you a shirt.

41:11.033 --> 41:13.601
- Let's go, shirt off.

41:13.645 --> 41:15.995
I'm waiting.
I got all day.

41:16.038 --> 41:17.518
Here we go.

41:17.562 --> 41:22.392
No ifs, ands, or buts.

41:22.436 --> 41:26.353
Easy, okay?

41:26.396 --> 41:28.747
You got it.

41:28.790 --> 41:31.924
No ifs,

41:31.967 --> 41:34.492
ands,

41:34.535 --> 41:37.756
or...mm...buts.

41:37.799 --> 41:39.279
- So good.

41:39.322 --> 41:40.454
So good.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.848
No...

41:42.891 --> 41:44.850
ifs...

41:44.893 --> 41:48.375
ands or...

41:48.418 --> 41:50.508
- Yeah.
- Buts.

41:50.551 --> 41:52.945
Don't stop now.

41:52.988 --> 41:55.208
No...

41:55.251 --> 41:57.297
ifs...

41:57.340 --> 41:59.560
ands...

41:59.604 --> 42:02.563
or buts.

42:02.607 --> 42:04.347
How good is that?

42:04.391 --> 42:06.436
- That's amazing.

42:07.829 --> 42:10.397
I knew you could do it.
I knew you could do it.

42:10.440 --> 42:11.703
But your shirt is still on,

42:11.746 --> 42:13.574
and you made
a very big mistake,

42:13.618 --> 42:15.402
so I'm gonna need
that shirt off.
