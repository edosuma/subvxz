<i>Previously on Strike Back...</i>

00:01.580 --> 00:03.995
We have a Code One level threat.
Imminent.

00:04.030 --> 00:05.190
Dalton was right.

00:05.225 --> 00:07.470
- Exceptional.
- You got a rough idea of its value?

00:07.505 --> 00:10.190
- 200 thousand.
- Thousand?

00:10.580 --> 00:12.040
- Mike, come in.
- Shit.

00:12.075 --> 00:14.195
- You all right? - Yeah. I checked in
with the embassy doctor.

00:14.225 --> 00:15.880
She's running some tests.

00:15.882 --> 00:17.635
- Old girlfriend?
- Yeah.

00:17.637 --> 00:19.035
Leave it with me.

00:19.070 --> 00:21.040
MacKenna's people are
attacking the embassy.

00:21.075 --> 00:24.960
When it's activated, the cloned drive
broadcasts a unique trackable signal.

00:24.995 --> 00:26.045
- Where?
- Russia.

00:26.080 --> 00:27.525
That's Arkady Ulyanov's backyard.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.290
Because we killed
his son in Colombia.

00:29.890 --> 00:31.735
NATO's operationally compromised

00:31.770 --> 00:35.200
and the whole of Europe is
exposed to an attack by Al-Zuhari.

00:51.080 --> 00:52.870
So, bud, did you want
to ask me anything?

00:53.620 --> 00:55.360
No, Scott, I don't think I do.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.920
So you don't want to ask me
how much those diamonds are worth?

01:04.260 --> 01:05.990
'Cause I think you do.

01:17.480 --> 01:19.390
Did you talk to the doc?

01:20.510 --> 01:22.050
Stress.

01:23.240 --> 01:25.510
It's years of carrying my partner.

01:27.340 --> 01:29.715
I thought I've lost weight.
- You have. You have lost weight.

01:31.990 --> 01:34.770
- You think those guys are lost?
- No.

01:35.440 --> 01:38.070
- Should we go and make some
new friends? - Yeah, I think we should.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.370
What's with the "A" Team?

01:49.620 --> 01:53.710
They don't know you, and they don't want
trouble from Arkady Ulyanov.

01:53.860 --> 01:57.202
- Were you expecting some?
- Ulyanov always gets his cut.

01:57.237 --> 01:58.960
We won't tell if you don't.

02:00.100 --> 02:01.650
Hmm. You got the stuff?

02:06.270 --> 02:09.949
- The best cocaine in Moscow, OK?
- Nice.

02:11.210 --> 02:12.650
The money.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.895
- Did you bring it?
- No, dude. Oh.

02:15.930 --> 02:18.445
- I didn't bring it.
- You were supposed to bring it, dude.

02:18.480 --> 02:20.995
- Man, I didn't bring it.
- Shit. Sorry.

02:21.030 --> 02:23.200
Hey, you don't need to
draw that. It's all right.

02:23.235 --> 02:25.490
Do you guys take a
check or credit cards?

02:26.230 --> 02:28.190
Hey, it's all right. No, no, no.

02:28.760 --> 02:31.125
- You set us up! - You set us up!
- Don't shoot!

02:31.155 --> 02:32.600
No, don't shoot!

02:32.920 --> 02:34.370
Get in the fucking car!

02:36.178 --> 02:37.961
Stop shooting!
Stop shooting!

02:39.002 --> 02:40.362
Stop shooting!

02:40.790 --> 02:44.650
- This really isn't helping my stress.
- Go, go! No, no, don't shoot! Don't shoot!

02:49.060 --> 02:50.640
Jesus Christ!

02:52.100 --> 02:53.501
Stop shooting!
Stop shooting!

02:53.520 --> 02:56.745
What are you saying, "Shoot at us"?
I don't think they're listening, Michael.

02:56.775 --> 03:00.000
- Dying is not part of this mission!
- We are not gonna die, Scott.

03:04.420 --> 03:05.790
Shit!

03:15.510 --> 03:17.755
Whoa, stop shooting! Stop shooting!

03:17.790 --> 03:20.330
- What, you think saying it
in English is gonna help? - What?

03:21.310 --> 03:23.970
Well, you always piss 'em
off with your driving, dude.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.530
You're starting to drive like me!

03:33.360 --> 03:35.110
How long are we gonna keep this up?

03:36.480 --> 03:37.750
Don't!

03:43.010 --> 03:44.640
All right, I think
we should stop now.

03:44.645 --> 03:46.360
- You want to stop?
- Yeah.

03:46.395 --> 03:47.990
All right, hold on.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.960
Next time I'm driving.

04:00.680 --> 04:03.260
We're, uh, we're
looking for the Bolshoi.

Sir, we have confirmation of
Scott and Stonebridge's arrest.

05:33.969 --> 05:37.700
{\an8}SECTION 20, MOSCOW

05:35.115 --> 05:36.420
Copy that.

05:38.480 --> 05:41.980
They're in. I want NATO
and Whitehall online in 5.

05:42.380 --> 05:43.670
Sir.

05:54.580 --> 05:57.620
This bad-guy shit's not
as much fun as I thought it'd be.

05:58.860 --> 06:02.995
48 hours ago, Al-Zuhari terrorists
attacked the British Embassy in Budapest

06:03.000 --> 06:04.835
and cloned a NATO hard drive.

06:04.840 --> 06:09.227
An ID pulse from the clone was detected
when someone attempted to access it.

06:09.262 --> 06:11.420
Well, the hard drive
is totally secure.

06:13.010 --> 06:16.590
<i>The pulse has been traced to
Black Bear Prison, here in Russia.</i>

06:17.080 --> 06:18.891
Welcome to the Bear!

06:20.870 --> 06:25.100
It's privately run. Mafia boss
by the name of Arkady Ulyanov.

06:25.110 --> 06:27.750
Everyone from the Governor
down is on his payroll.

06:28.061 --> 06:29.881
Take them away!

06:32.230 --> 06:36.750
A high-value source has confirmed
Ulyanov is working with Al-Zuhari.

06:37.310 --> 06:39.410
- Strip search!
- What does that mean?

06:39.710 --> 06:41.140
"Americans first."

06:44.841 --> 06:46.700
- Open!
- Fuck you.

06:47.730 --> 06:49.660
Fuck. All right,
all right, all right.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.690
There you go.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.700
- What is this?
- That's your mother's number.

06:56.710 --> 06:58.180
- Damien.
- Huh?

07:03.690 --> 07:05.220
It's going well.

07:06.280 --> 07:09.885
They'd have to pierce 3 firewalls
before they could access the NATO hub.

07:09.925 --> 07:12.830
- There is no way...
- They couldn't, but this man can.

07:13.890 --> 07:16.125
Computer hacker Erik Andersson.

07:16.160 --> 07:21.190
Currently being extradited to the U.S.
for leaking intel on allied operations in Iran.

07:21.420 --> 07:24.640
Andersson was in
a minimum-security prison

07:24.645 --> 07:26.830
until 3 days ago, when he
was transferred to Black Bear.

07:27.140 --> 07:28.490
Fuck! Oh!

07:31.320 --> 07:34.110
You never forget a girl's number.
What's with this one?

07:34.990 --> 07:36.490
This one's different.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.090
Why?

07:38.660 --> 07:40.075
Kinda special.

07:40.110 --> 07:42.250
Make sure you get
behind those ears.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.710
Have you informed the Russians?

07:45.350 --> 07:47.190
Officially, no.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.990
Ulyanov also has half the Federal
Security Service in his pocket.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.260
But I have a man inside
the other half of the FSB.

07:57.100 --> 07:58.500
You were right.

07:58.580 --> 08:01.580
The first firewall was
breached 15 minutes ago.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.835
This Andersson has to be stopped.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.500
My men are already inside
Black Bear with orders

08:06.535 --> 08:08.330
to destroy the drive
and get Andersson out...

08:09.740 --> 08:11.820
or kill him if they can't.

08:26.100 --> 08:28.130
Grab that hard drive
and get out.

08:28.780 --> 08:30.400
Sounds great to me, dude.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.409
There's Andersson.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.940
What the fuck are we
doing in here, anyway?

08:40.440 --> 08:43.559
Ulyanov finds out we're in his prison,
we're dead men walking.

08:43.720 --> 08:44.960
Well...

08:46.980 --> 08:49.210
You want to risk
a little unwanted attention?

08:49.640 --> 08:51.820
- Yeah.
- Let's do the thing.

08:51.870 --> 08:53.600
Why? You always win.

08:53.610 --> 08:55.410
I know. That's why
I like doing it. Come on.

08:56.400 --> 08:57.760
1, 2...

08:58.730 --> 09:00.065
There you go.

09:00.070 --> 09:03.625
I'm gonna snag their fun, strike those guards
over there from Hacker Boy.

09:03.655 --> 09:05.800
- You grab him.
- You want the evil elves?

09:05.810 --> 09:07.180
Yeah.

09:07.660 --> 09:09.550
Yeah, I think it'll do me good.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.470
You sure, Mikey?

09:12.710 --> 09:14.320
- Yeah.
- All right.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.110
Go get 'em.

09:24.310 --> 09:26.920
Gentlemen, excuse me.

09:28.480 --> 09:32.420
- Can't we all just get along?
- Hey, don't you know who the fuck we are?

09:32.455 --> 09:35.390
I know exactly who you are.
Yeah, big tattoos, tiny pricks.

09:35.980 --> 09:38.715
tiny pricks. Yeah, I got
a pretty good idea.

09:39.351 --> 09:40.651
Get him!

10:05.480 --> 10:06.910
Andersson.

10:08.460 --> 10:10.050
Who are you?

10:10.770 --> 10:12.540
We're here to get you out.

10:12.990 --> 10:14.720
How do I know I can trust you?

10:14.750 --> 10:18.710
Well, that intel that
you leaked on ops in Iran?

10:19.370 --> 10:23.980
You held back information on 5 undercover
operatives that would have died otherwise.

10:24.070 --> 10:26.030
Now, who else would know that?

10:29.770 --> 10:32.850
- The NATO hard drive. Where is it?
- I can't help you.

10:34.390 --> 10:36.030
When you're done,
they're gonna kill you.

10:36.065 --> 10:37.660
They have my friends.

10:37.700 --> 10:40.250
If I don't do what they
want, they're all dead.

10:41.100 --> 10:44.285
You think that they're gonna let you
and your friends go when you're finished?

10:45.310 --> 10:48.995
You break through that last firewall, you and
a whole lot of innocent people are gonna die.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.580
That's a fact.

10:52.520 --> 10:56.040
- So, your friends, where are they?
- Hell, I don't know.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.450
I only saw them on a video link.

10:58.670 --> 11:01.025
They were in some
empty swimming pool.

11:01.060 --> 11:03.810
There was a military
insignia on one of the walls.

11:07.170 --> 11:08.820
You buy us some time.

11:09.370 --> 11:11.010
We'll find your friends.

11:11.770 --> 11:13.930
You might want
to look after yours.

11:14.890 --> 11:15.920
Yeah.

11:16.510 --> 11:17.840
Mike!

11:18.170 --> 11:19.560
Mike!

11:20.610 --> 11:21.980
Stop!

11:22.610 --> 11:25.060
Mike, stop!
You're gonna kill him!

11:25.110 --> 11:28.620
Get off. Come here.
Get off him.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.570
Take a deep fuckin' breath.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.640
Give me the phone.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.101
Come here my sweet!

11:41.422 --> 11:43.330
Take him away
and transfer him!

11:44.450 --> 11:47.030
In the Bear, there is
no place for weakness.

11:47.901 --> 11:49.551
Clear the yard!

11:52.880 --> 11:54.520
Say, you want me
to slit your throat?

11:54.555 --> 11:56.010
Fuck off.

12:03.160 --> 12:04.640
They got hostages.

12:05.720 --> 12:08.670
- It's gonna take longer
than we thought. - Yeah.

12:09.290 --> 12:11.270
You think our cover's gonna hold?

12:12.100 --> 12:13.890
If you keep pulling shit like that,

12:14.440 --> 12:15.970
probably not.

12:21.070 --> 12:22.750
Thank you, Doctor.

12:23.270 --> 12:25.880
How are things going
at your facility?

12:26.195 --> 12:28.490
Your work must be
almost finished by now.

12:29.050 --> 12:32.090
Your job is to supply
me with what I need.

12:32.510 --> 12:33.960
Nothing more.

12:34.590 --> 12:38.310
<i>When Andersson is done,
you will see he is transferred.</i>

12:38.345 --> 12:41.190
Of course... Doctor.

12:52.950 --> 12:54.250
Sit.

13:38.560 --> 13:41.340
What the fuck happened out there?
You OK?

13:41.710 --> 13:43.110
I've lost it.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.120
I'm burnt out.

13:46.530 --> 13:48.240
You got to hold it together, Mike.

13:48.340 --> 13:50.440
- Yeah.
- I can't carry you.

13:50.710 --> 13:52.220
Not in here.

13:52.480 --> 13:54.720
How much are the
diamonds worth, Scott?

13:56.470 --> 13:57.890
I'm done.

14:13.910 --> 14:17.580
Oy, you talk about anything
you see or hear in this cell,

14:17.615 --> 14:19.320
you're a dead man,
is that clear?

14:20.690 --> 14:22.970
Not before I cut your throat!

14:25.370 --> 14:27.120
Oh, yeah? Yeah?

14:27.520 --> 14:28.950
Come here.

14:29.020 --> 14:30.360
Sit down.

14:30.420 --> 14:33.075
What else you got here, huh?
Any other little surprises?

14:33.110 --> 14:35.230
- No, leave it!
- Wait. Come on. Stop.

14:42.240 --> 14:43.740
That's nice.

14:44.970 --> 14:46.670
It's not really my color.

14:48.280 --> 14:49.930
What else we got?

14:50.810 --> 14:52.210
Yep.

14:55.140 --> 14:57.560
That is really pretty.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.790
Is it yours?

15:00.980 --> 15:03.740
- Is none of your fucking business!
- Easy.

15:04.550 --> 15:06.480
Whatever gets you through
those long prison nights.

15:06.485 --> 15:08.170
You don't understand.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.550
In Russian prison, they
kill a man for less.

15:10.585 --> 15:13.730
Relax.
Your secret's safe with us.

15:17.420 --> 15:18.880
It's all good.

15:20.140 --> 15:21.750
Then...

15:22.180 --> 15:24.230
I am deaf and blind.

15:26.245 --> 15:29.331
{\an8}INTERNATIONAL BANK, MOSCOW

15:26.980 --> 15:29.300
You wish to transfer all funds

15:29.335 --> 15:31.720
and close each of these accounts?

15:39.310 --> 15:40.970
There is a problem?

15:41.610 --> 15:43.970
Given the amounts, we are

15:43.975 --> 15:46.271
obliged to run some CFT checks.

15:46.305 --> 15:49.960
- After all, I could be a terrorist.
- N-no, but, uh...

15:50.000 --> 15:52.090
Appearances can be deceptive.

16:45.160 --> 16:47.820
The stunt you pulled in the yard.

16:48.530 --> 16:53.210
That could get you transferred
unless you're lucky, or a Muslim.

16:54.350 --> 16:55.740
Why a Muslim?

16:55.760 --> 16:59.360
Don't know, but sometimes,

16:59.620 --> 17:02.145
this Muslim comes with Japanese

17:02.180 --> 17:04.670
to supervise transfers, but...

17:05.190 --> 17:07.280
he never takes his own.

17:07.319 --> 17:08.740
Does he have a name?

17:11.329 --> 17:12.599
Hussan.

17:13.050 --> 17:14.454
Reza Hussan.

17:14.770 --> 17:17.359
- Transferred where?
- Who knows?

17:18.109 --> 17:19.900
But once you're gone,

17:19.980 --> 17:22.589
nobody hears from you again.

17:23.230 --> 17:24.710
Nobody.

17:44.440 --> 17:47.945
Andersson is slowing it down,
but he's halfway through the second firewall.

17:48.440 --> 17:50.455
Check this. Kamali.

17:50.490 --> 17:52.420
My guys picked it up from the FSB.

18:00.300 --> 18:02.725
- What the hell's he doing?
- CIA have no idea.

18:02.730 --> 18:05.190
Van Berg's already
on a flight from Berlin.

18:16.690 --> 18:19.730
- Philip Locke.
- Yeah, it's me.

18:19.890 --> 18:22.450
<i>We got a problem.
We need more time.</i>

18:22.490 --> 18:23.740
Yeah?

18:24.400 --> 18:26.175
He says they're
holding his friends.

18:26.180 --> 18:28.470
He was part of some
kind of hacker commune.

18:28.505 --> 18:30.825
<i>He won't help us till
he knows they're safe.</i>

18:30.860 --> 18:33.940
He's seen them on video
in some emptied-out pool,

18:34.250 --> 18:36.170
military insignia.

18:37.560 --> 18:40.680
Also, you heard of a
guy named Reza Hussan?

18:40.870 --> 18:42.630
He could have
something to do with it,

18:42.665 --> 18:44.552
something about
disappearing prisoners.

18:44.587 --> 18:47.770
- One of Al-Zuhari's key lieutenants.
- Find out what you can.

18:48.830 --> 18:50.210
Listen...

18:50.910 --> 18:53.190
Michael's test
results came through.

18:53.750 --> 18:56.500
<i>He's been exposed
to a neurotoxin, Scott.</i>

18:57.380 --> 18:58.800
<i>How is he?</i>

18:59.380 --> 19:01.070
Any paralysis?

19:01.820 --> 19:03.300
Yeah, maybe.

19:03.310 --> 19:06.310
My advice is you don't tell
him, but it's your call, Scott.

19:07.310 --> 19:09.900
He's probably in the last cycle.
If he is...

19:10.990 --> 19:13.200
<i>he will deteriorate rapidly.</i>

19:13.420 --> 19:15.830
<i>It could be a day,
maybe two.</i>

19:16.250 --> 19:18.440
Any thoughts on what
we should do about that?

19:18.450 --> 19:22.030
Sir...
Kamali contacted Van Berg.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.560
He wants to meet.

19:25.150 --> 19:26.900
There is an antitoxin, Scott.

19:26.910 --> 19:29.900
Yeah, and if your FSB guy doesn't
get us out of here in time?

19:30.105 --> 19:33.112
As soon as we have the hostages,
you'll be the first to know.

19:33.170 --> 19:35.110
Sir? Reza Hussan.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.000
All good, dude.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.620
FSB HQ, MOSCOW

20:14.021 --> 20:15.621
Zukov.

20:16.452 --> 20:17.792
What's this?

20:17.843 --> 20:20.833
Two of the foreigners
in Black Bear.

20:23.210 --> 20:25.175
The men Ulyanov is looking for?

20:25.708 --> 20:27.380
Quietly. Speak English.

20:29.450 --> 20:33.145
He is offering $500,000 each.

20:33.380 --> 20:35.670
You were going to
keep them to yourself.

20:43.180 --> 20:44.570
50-50.

20:52.610 --> 20:55.590
- Mikey, you awake?
- Yeah.

20:56.220 --> 21:00.390
You know those dirty little stones?
They're worth a little south of two mil.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.750
Fuck.

21:06.300 --> 21:08.240
Damien?

21:09.000 --> 21:11.450
You want to tell me what that
phone number was all about?

21:13.320 --> 21:16.500
- Once upon a time, I was an asshole.
- Once upon a time?

21:20.930 --> 21:24.100
There was this girl.
I got her pregnant.

21:25.710 --> 21:28.410
What good was I gonna be
for her or the kid, you know?

21:28.520 --> 21:30.010
Did you walk out on them?

21:36.580 --> 21:37.410
Yeah.

21:39.790 --> 21:41.660
Not my proudest moment.

21:43.764 --> 21:48.210
It's a scary thought,
the idea that you could have a kid.

21:52.600 --> 21:53.610
Mikey.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.080
I got some good news
and I got some bad news.

22:01.450 --> 22:03.820
Good news is you're
not losing your mind.

22:06.650 --> 22:08.390
And what's the bad news?

22:11.280 --> 22:14.460
You're sick.
Really fuckin' sick.

22:17.210 --> 22:20.090
You've been infected with
some kind of neurotoxin.

22:23.260 --> 22:25.410
- You know how your hand's
seizing up? - Yeah.

22:26.020 --> 22:28.390
Pretty soon it's
gonna go to your legs,

22:29.040 --> 22:31.080
and it's gonna get
into your lungs.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.490
It was those shells
at Leatherby's airfield.

22:39.300 --> 22:40.668
How long?

22:44.920 --> 22:46.184
A day.

22:47.030 --> 22:48.350
Maybe two.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.520
Well, that's great.

22:53.520 --> 22:54.850
I'm not crazy.

22:56.610 --> 22:58.170
I'm just fucked.

23:30.950 --> 23:31.880
Locke.

23:32.480 --> 23:35.450
Al-Zuhari ordered me
to close all of his accounts.

23:35.485 --> 23:36.665
This man came with me,

23:36.700 --> 23:41.260
and I'm certain he had orders
to kill me once it was done.

23:41.310 --> 23:43.960
- Why?
- CIA... - I asked him.

23:44.820 --> 23:48.079
Al-Zuhari's people
suspect a traitor.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.770
Oh, what? You think I should have
let him put a bullet through me first.

23:51.805 --> 23:54.150
Yes, I'm fucking sure!

23:57.960 --> 23:59.455
They will kill me.

23:59.490 --> 24:02.590
- I have a child...
- I had two!

24:03.410 --> 24:05.120
I now have one.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.400
Isn't that why we do this, Leo?

24:11.410 --> 24:13.630
You need to give me time.

24:31.180 --> 24:32.890
Get in the car.

24:34.820 --> 24:37.250
- Come on, get in!
- Go, go, go!

24:46.850 --> 24:50.160
- What did I miss? - Andersson's
through to the last firewall,

24:50.230 --> 24:52.220
but the process has slowed.

24:52.260 --> 24:54.445
In the meantime,
we've been monitoring

24:54.480 --> 24:58.160
all movements of military municipal
swimming pools in the area.

24:58.810 --> 25:01.490
This looks promising.
Get me an ID.

25:05.620 --> 25:08.830
OK, we have a possible
match for Reza Hassan.

25:09.230 --> 25:12.950
It's a run-down sports facility
on the outskirts of the city.

25:14.130 --> 25:15.965
That's good enough for me.
Kit up.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.975
- Secure the hostages, then
we can get to Andersson.- Sir.

25:19.010 --> 25:21.210
So, the Governor of Black
Bear's moving prisoners,

25:21.220 --> 25:24.200
and we have a link to Al-Zuhari.

25:24.330 --> 25:27.600
And it's happening now, it might have
something to do with what he's planning.

25:28.910 --> 25:30.865
Arkady Ulyanov owns the prison.

25:30.900 --> 25:33.560
I want you two to meet.
Find out what he knows.

25:34.210 --> 25:35.640
Just a second.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.500
You realize,

25:37.750 --> 25:41.770
in all likelihood, it was
Al-Zuhari who just tried to kill me.

25:42.870 --> 25:45.340
He operates on a
need-to-know basis, right?

25:46.430 --> 25:50.365
What, do you want Ulyanov to know he has a
traitor at the highest level of his operation?

25:51.300 --> 25:53.350
You're the only man
who can do this, Leo.

25:54.470 --> 25:57.640
Yeah.
Thanks.

26:06.970 --> 26:09.699
You think that bomb was meant
for you as well as Van Berg,

26:09.705 --> 26:10.545
and you're thinking...

26:10.580 --> 26:13.540
That Dalton might have got
a few things right, yeah.

26:14.440 --> 26:17.770
He better be on our side 'cause we need all
the friends we can get.

26:20.150 --> 26:23.790
- So, Pushkin, you have
family on the outside? - My wife.

26:25.160 --> 26:28.860
My daughter.
But I will never see them again.

26:28.895 --> 26:31.990
- You want to get out?
- Of course.

26:33.400 --> 26:34.550
Very badly.

26:37.200 --> 26:39.590
You get us to Andersson,
we'll get you outta here.

26:44.370 --> 26:47.320
You do want to see your family
again, don't you, Pushkin?

26:48.880 --> 26:50.350
We're giving you that chance,

26:50.650 --> 26:53.770
even if it's just once,
from across the street.

27:00.770 --> 27:02.580
What do you need?

27:04.200 --> 27:05.755
A distraction.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.940
Oh... you would need a riot.

27:26.600 --> 27:27.960
You are too slow.

27:28.450 --> 27:31.750
This isn't easy. I have
to find another password.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.860
Your colleagues are waiting.

27:34.540 --> 27:36.020
Listen, my friend.

27:36.530 --> 27:40.750
If you put me in a place where
I have to explain failure,

27:41.150 --> 27:45.820
you will look upon their quick
and brutal deaths with envy.

27:55.730 --> 27:58.310
Andersson is kept
in isolation wing.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.650
It can only be accessed
through "B" Wing,

28:00.685 --> 28:02.400
and guarded at all times.

28:02.435 --> 28:05.510
- Keys?
- Only guards at gate have them.

28:06.170 --> 28:07.800
How do you know all this shit?

28:07.890 --> 28:12.355
When I first sent here,
I spend much time in isolation.

28:12.390 --> 28:14.330
So we take out the
guards, we're in.

28:14.550 --> 28:17.270
No. The Vory have
free run of "B" Wing.

28:18.060 --> 28:21.970
- Fuckin' pussies.
- Hmm. Well, not The Wolf.

28:22.005 --> 28:24.780
Ex-special forces.
Spetsnaz.

28:25.450 --> 28:29.640
- And then?
- Another key and 4 more pussies.

28:45.073 --> 28:46.741
Why are you stopping?

28:53.771 --> 28:55.710
What are you doing, Zukov?

28:58.365 --> 29:01.922
Our deal has changed a little.

29:03.509 --> 29:07.580
Okay.
Take 75 percent.

29:08.353 --> 29:10.497
You can still retire.

29:12.434 --> 29:14.375
It's not me who is retiring.

29:15.563 --> 29:21.184
Yes, it is.
Asshole!

29:41.360 --> 29:43.950
They've traced the hostages.
They're on their way now.

29:44.290 --> 29:45.200
Good.

30:02.610 --> 30:03.560
Hello?

30:18.790 --> 30:19.790
Amjad?

30:38.170 --> 30:40.680
Too slow. Too slow! Too slow!

30:40.715 --> 30:42.210
It's a technical fault.

30:42.400 --> 30:45.985
- The proxy drive doesn't answer...
- No, Mr. Andersson.

30:46.020 --> 30:50.420
- Somebody has told you to delay.
- No.

30:50.750 --> 30:54.600
Why else would you delay the program
when you know the consequences?

30:55.390 --> 30:58.680
- You think somebody will save you?
- No.

30:58.690 --> 31:03.210
- That is the only explanation.
- No. I swear.

31:04.150 --> 31:06.960
Call Hassan!
Tell him to give live.

31:11.771 --> 31:14.051
Watch carefully my dear!

31:16.560 --> 31:17.420
Yes.

31:19.440 --> 31:20.650
Yes, everything's...

31:20.685 --> 31:21.890
Reza Hassan.

31:26.733 --> 31:29.190
- Move them up against the wall.
- Move it!

31:29.595 --> 31:31.560
Wait. What are you doing?
What are you doing?

31:39.835 --> 31:42.317
In front of the camera.

31:43.050 --> 31:48.240
Who contacted you?
One of your friends will die.

31:48.460 --> 31:51.360
- Who contacted you?!
- Don't do this.

31:51.395 --> 31:55.035
- Kill the boy.
- No! No!

31:55.070 --> 31:57.945
No! No! Please!

31:57.980 --> 32:00.820
No! Please!

32:00.830 --> 32:03.885
Please! No! Please!

32:03.920 --> 32:06.940
No! No! Please!

32:08.790 --> 32:10.630
- We have to move now.
- Stand down.

32:10.970 --> 32:13.820
If we move when the camera's on,
we compromise Scott and Stonebridge.

32:13.870 --> 32:15.610
- He's a kid.
- Hold.

32:15.890 --> 32:17.610
No! No!

32:17.770 --> 32:20.455
Please, take me! No, please!

32:20.490 --> 32:23.140
- I'm sorry, Anna!
- Shut up!

32:23.175 --> 32:27.320
How touching.
If that is what she wants, let her!

32:46.790 --> 32:48.190
Nothin'.

32:51.680 --> 32:54.790
Who contacted you?

32:58.740 --> 33:00.440
I did it.

33:02.300 --> 33:06.090
I decided to do it.
Nobody asked me to delay.

33:06.600 --> 33:10.910
They're going to kill people.
I can't be a part of that.

33:11.840 --> 33:12.790
So...

33:14.750 --> 33:16.650
you will be a party to this.

33:17.450 --> 33:19.270
- Kill her.
- No!

33:21.874 --> 33:24.712
Cut the link!
Stay here!

33:26.800 --> 33:29.800
Just finish the job
or we will kill the rest.

33:34.730 --> 33:35.910
Camera's off. Go.

33:40.760 --> 33:42.240
I'm on Hassan.

33:42.290 --> 33:45.820
- Hostages acquired, good to go.
- Roger that.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.700
Oh, fuck!

33:56.430 --> 33:59.920
We're on, Mikey.
Are you gonna be all right?

34:02.620 --> 34:03.650
Yeah.

34:07.700 --> 34:09.020
Come on, Pushkin.

34:11.960 --> 34:12.900
Come on.

34:24.025 --> 34:27.185
These prisoners are
to be handed over to FSB.

34:27.186 --> 34:30.360
It's a matter of national security.

34:31.610 --> 34:34.688
Open the fucking gate, imbecile!

34:49.984 --> 34:53.262
What the fuck...
is that on your face?

34:53.263 --> 34:56.576
Maybe you should try it!

35:06.730 --> 35:10.210
- They're gonna kill him.
- Nah, he'll be all right.

35:10.250 --> 35:11.450
Pushkin!

35:17.602 --> 35:19.749
On your knees, bitch!

35:20.970 --> 35:21.880
Pushkin!

35:28.846 --> 35:30.846
Yes, I wear a dress!

35:30.849 --> 35:32.406
I wear make up too.

35:32.416 --> 35:35.889
I'm happy, is that
a problem for you?

35:35.895 --> 35:41.627
But, you're happy to let these
cocksukers keep you locked up!

35:41.670 --> 35:45.517
You say nothing and do nothing,

35:45.788 --> 35:47.924
when your comrades
are taken away.

35:47.928 --> 35:51.697
And then they disappear!

35:51.699 --> 35:55.254
Where are they transferred to?

35:56.409 --> 35:58.992
They're being murdered there!

35:59.677 --> 36:03.030
This is what I say to
Governor Ilyin...

36:03.712 --> 36:06.241
Fuck you!

36:06.276 --> 36:09.349
Trash the place!
Destroy it!

36:10.484 --> 36:12.107
Fuck you Ilyin!

36:27.650 --> 36:30.170
Come here! Pushkin,
come here! Get in, get in!

36:36.570 --> 36:37.810
Let's go, let's go.

36:38.300 --> 36:39.895
Mikey!

36:39.930 --> 36:41.525
Pushkin, put his clothes
on and clean your face.

36:41.560 --> 36:44.130
That was an Oscar-worthy
performance there. Well done, mate.

36:44.165 --> 36:47.200
Now we're gonna play dress-ups.
Come on, come on.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.028
They've broken out of "B" wing.

36:50.029 --> 36:51.858
Use tear gas!

36:59.940 --> 37:01.640
I take it that's The Wolf.

37:02.280 --> 37:03.200
That's him.

37:04.560 --> 37:08.580
- What the fuck's he doing with a shovel?
- Spetsnaz love their shovels.

37:09.580 --> 37:10.480
Here.

37:11.260 --> 37:13.560
- Is better than nothing.
- Fucking kidding me?

37:14.190 --> 37:16.960
You're gonna go get
Andersson. I'll get this guy.

37:18.370 --> 37:21.740
Hey, pal, fight's that way.

37:24.140 --> 37:25.480
What are you gonna
do with that shovel?

37:25.660 --> 37:28.230
Dig up some potatoes and
make some homemade "Vodka"?

37:56.060 --> 37:57.880
You want some?! Huh?!

37:58.100 --> 37:59.100
Back off!

38:00.970 --> 38:02.450
- Mike!
- We're in here. What?

38:05.660 --> 38:08.220
- It's tear gas. Put that on.
- Tear gas coming.

38:08.310 --> 38:09.920
Wrap that around your face.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.450
All right? Let's go.

38:23.670 --> 38:25.451
Use live rounds!

38:29.020 --> 38:31.700
Ilyin? FSB.

38:33.188 --> 38:36.721
- I want these men.
- Are you kidding?

38:37.280 --> 38:39.865
The prison is in lockdown.

38:43.163 --> 38:45.151
Shouldn't you have a partner?

38:47.164 --> 38:50.684
I shot him on the way over.
What's it to you?

38:53.014 --> 38:54.745
You know who I work for?

38:55.288 --> 38:58.742
Take me to them or
I'll shoot you as well!

38:59.361 --> 39:02.040
Open the gate!
Two for isolation.

39:25.060 --> 39:26.990
"B."
Is right through there.

39:41.420 --> 39:43.695
It's too late!
You're too late!

39:43.730 --> 39:46.380
Anna died for nothing,
you fucking bastards!

39:46.415 --> 39:48.242
- Enough!
- You lied to me!

39:48.277 --> 39:50.035
You lied! It's decrypted!

39:50.070 --> 39:52.285
- Calm down.
- It's too late!

39:52.320 --> 39:54.500
- Shut up!
- Sit down! Sit down!

39:59.130 --> 40:02.480
Now calm down.
The rest of your friends are free.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.120
We're gonna get you out of here.

40:05.270 --> 40:07.693
Ilyin.

40:07.695 --> 40:08.814
- On him, Mike?
- Yeah.

40:08.815 --> 40:11.540
- Stay. - Which way?
- This way.

40:15.720 --> 40:18.000
Mikey, I got 5 armed
guards coming at us.

40:22.600 --> 40:23.490
That worked.

40:29.311 --> 40:32.929
- Let's negotiate with them.
- Fuck negotiation!

40:34.390 --> 40:38.270
I am Major Nina Pirogova
from Russian Intelligence Security.

40:38.570 --> 40:42.610
I am unarmed,
and I'm coming in alone.

40:51.420 --> 40:54.290
Unarmed, my ass.
Walk.

40:55.560 --> 40:58.640
There is a man who is very
keen to speak with you.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.080
- Give him the phone.
- Got her?

41:03.600 --> 41:05.340
Yeah, fuck you, Ulyanov.

41:06.330 --> 41:09.040
So, I take it you've
met Major Pirogova.

41:09.075 --> 41:12.810
- Boss.
- Yeah. She's with us.

41:15.240 --> 41:18.670
- You're Locke's inside man?
- I look like a man to you?

41:20.005 --> 41:21.270
My weapon.

41:21.290 --> 41:24.240
Yeah, the hard drive's destroyed,
but we were too late.

41:24.920 --> 41:27.055
No, he already
completed the decryption.

41:27.090 --> 41:28.760
Well, whatever Al-Zuhari
wanted, he's gonna have it.

41:28.795 --> 41:30.640
One second, one second.
What are you doing?

41:30.940 --> 41:34.160
My job is to get you out of here.
I can't do it with him.

41:34.170 --> 41:37.630
- Don't let her do this.
You said you'd get me out. - Shit!

41:39.281 --> 41:41.086
Everything is under control.

41:43.137 --> 41:45.182
This one is for you!

41:47.025 --> 41:48.835
Come on! Come on!

41:52.852 --> 41:54.057
Escort the Major.

41:54.092 --> 41:57.710
We have an escort.
Lose the guns and move.

41:57.730 --> 42:00.560
- Who the fuck is this?
- Pushkin.

42:01.320 --> 42:04.110
- He's with us or you're on your own.
- Philip, we're moving out.

42:04.390 --> 42:06.160
Take your phone, your
phone. Take your phone.

42:08.155 --> 42:09.851
I have it all under control.

42:10.270 --> 42:11.680
Walk.

42:17.730 --> 42:20.930
- Where'd Locke find a guy like you?
- Shut the fuck up.

42:23.677 --> 42:26.177
ULYANOV'S DACHA, MOSCOW

42:51.108 --> 42:52.608
Come in!

42:58.340 --> 43:00.440
What happened at the bank?

43:01.170 --> 43:06.000
Money had to be moved.
These are the final preparations.

43:17.340 --> 43:19.960
Why are you here, Leo, hmm?

43:22.200 --> 43:24.640
To talk to you about
Al-Zuhari's plans.

43:27.080 --> 43:28.208
Go on.

43:29.640 --> 43:32.190
We need something from you.

43:37.670 --> 43:38.610
More?

43:39.020 --> 43:39.930
Well...

43:40.640 --> 43:46.040
in return, I can give you what
you truly want more than anything.

43:48.291 --> 43:50.666
Holster your guns!
Everything is okay.

43:54.090 --> 43:59.010
- How you doing?
- Just brilliant.

43:59.819 --> 44:03.330
The foreigners who arrived today.
These men murdered my son.

44:04.522 --> 44:07.411
Bring them to me! Now!

44:14.163 --> 44:17.281
- Arrest the Major immediately!
- Stop!

44:21.120 --> 44:24.070
- What the fuck?
- Move. They're on to us.

44:24.105 --> 44:25.470
We go this way.

44:32.230 --> 44:33.850
There must be another way.

44:34.550 --> 44:38.460
That's Andersson.
I promised we'd get him out.

44:38.790 --> 44:42.120
He's gone, Mikey.
We got to get you to a hospital.

44:42.610 --> 44:45.450
Pushkin.
That's the transfer vehicle, right?

44:45.485 --> 44:48.840
They're taking him to the same place
they took the others?

44:49.980 --> 44:52.770
Whatever Al-Zuhari's planning,
that must be a part of it, Scott.

44:53.480 --> 44:56.830
- Fine. I'm gone.
- Nobody is going anywhere.

44:57.530 --> 44:58.390
Fuck!

44:59.840 --> 45:03.385
- Get us out of here.
- We're not moving. He's sick.

45:03.420 --> 45:05.175
I'm waiting right here
until he comes back.

45:05.200 --> 45:07.780
I'm getting at least
one of you back alive.

45:07.915 --> 45:10.050
- You're not gonna shoot me, sweetie.
- Yeah?

45:10.980 --> 45:12.440
Try me.

45:12.970 --> 45:14.360
Fucking move!

45:14.600 --> 45:17.530
Pushkin, don't do it.
Pushkin... fuck!

45:28.800 --> 45:30.330
Let's get you out of here.

45:35.987 --> 45:40.275
Shoot them! Shoot them!
Shoot them now!

45:56.340 --> 45:59.590
This lead to part
of building they no longer use.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.730
- It's possible we get out here.
- It's locked.

46:03.800 --> 46:04.710
Come here.

46:06.140 --> 46:07.010
Good shot.

46:07.850 --> 46:09.345
- Stop!
- Come on!

46:09.380 --> 46:10.900
- Go, go.
- Fuck.

46:10.950 --> 46:12.340
- Get in.
- Thank you.

46:12.375 --> 46:13.730
- Go on. Go.
- Thank you!

46:14.605 --> 46:17.133
Stay still!
Don't move!

46:19.659 --> 46:23.250
Don't take this personally, but your plan
could use a little more finesse.
