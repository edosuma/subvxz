WEBVTT

00:02.603 --> 00:05.537
Ugh, why are you dragging us
to church with you?

00:05.539 --> 00:08.440
We were gonna find Jeff the
perfect pair of overalls today.

00:08.442 --> 00:10.976
It's always the chest pocket
that's the dealbreaker.

00:10.978 --> 00:13.312
When it comes to overalls,
you can't settle.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.014
It's why Kris Kross
split up.

00:15.016 --> 00:16.882
It's Wiggity-wiggity-wiggity
sad.

00:16.884 --> 00:20.219
This family goes to church
on Easter, end of story.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.787
Well, Roger's part
of the family.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.022
Why doesn't he have to go?

00:23.024 --> 00:25.524
Roger goes to church,
just not ours.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.026
(upbeat hymn music playing)

00:27.028 --> 00:28.460
¶ You got to have ¶
¶ Power ¶

00:28.462 --> 00:30.462
¶ All you need is ¶
¶ Power ¶

00:30.464 --> 00:32.898
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:32.900 --> 00:34.199
Oh!

00:34.201 --> 00:36.635
Brother Jenkins
is feeling it!

00:36.637 --> 00:39.538
Jesus, take my feet!

00:41.308 --> 00:44.910
Okay, kids, get ready to find
those Easter eggs.

00:44.912 --> 00:46.478
Aren't you too old
for this?

00:46.480 --> 00:48.213
You're never too old
to have fun.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.548
(whistle blows)
(thud!)

00:49.550 --> 00:51.050
(indistinct shouting)
Boy: Over here!

00:51.052 --> 00:52.985
And stay down!

00:57.858 --> 01:01.260
Bow to your leader,
the King of eggs!

01:01.262 --> 01:03.996
Hey, kid in the middle
you're faking!

01:03.998 --> 01:07.232
Aaatomic Easter drop!

01:07.234 --> 01:10.035
(patriotic music plays)

01:10.037 --> 01:12.905
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

01:12.907 --> 01:16.341
¶ I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day ¶

01:16.343 --> 01:19.678
¶ The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

01:19.680 --> 01:23.749
¶ And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race ¶

01:25.686 --> 01:28.954
¶ Oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

01:28.956 --> 01:31.256
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

01:31.258 --> 01:32.591
Aah!

01:33.794 --> 01:37.262
¶<i> Good morning, U.S.A.</i> ¶

01:39.900 --> 01:41.900
Which is why, on this day,

01:41.902 --> 01:44.470
we remember what happened
in Galilee.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.939
Psst!
Red hat!

01:46.941 --> 01:48.207
Red hat!

01:51.612 --> 01:53.745
Stan, who is that?

01:53.747 --> 01:56.582
If I play my cards right,
a new friend.

01:56.584 --> 01:59.284
Mr. Smith, your son
has outgrown Sunday school.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.653
Smart, lady -- get rid
of the one kid who can kind of

02:01.655 --> 02:03.322
go to the bathroom by himself.

02:03.324 --> 02:06.058
-Sit!
-Okay.

02:06.060 --> 02:08.727
So, this is
adult services?

02:08.729 --> 02:10.496
The place is bigger
than I imagined.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.264
Were we supposed to bring
our own cushions, or --

02:12.266 --> 02:13.565
Shh!

02:13.567 --> 02:16.935
And the disciples
found his tomb empty

02:16.937 --> 02:20.172
because he had risen
from the dead, and then --

02:20.174 --> 02:23.108
So -- so Jesus was
like a zombie?

02:23.110 --> 02:24.977
Like in
"The Walking Dead"?

02:24.979 --> 02:27.613
...Shall ye be told
what shall be made...

02:27.615 --> 02:29.248
I wish Chris Hardwick
were here

02:29.250 --> 02:31.517
to giddily explain
these confusing plot points.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.018
Shh!

02:33.020 --> 02:35.187
Doubting Thomas himself
stepped forward...

02:35.189 --> 02:38.190
Doubting Thomas stuck his finger
in Jesus' what?

02:38.192 --> 02:40.692
Am I the only one here who
thinks this is totally weird?!

02:40.694 --> 02:41.960
-Shh!
-Quiet!

02:41.962 --> 02:43.629
-Please!
-Come on!

02:43.631 --> 02:45.764
Is anyone
actually buying this?

02:45.766 --> 02:47.666
Steve, you're destroying
all the groundwork

02:47.668 --> 02:49.535
I laid with red hat.

02:49.537 --> 02:52.004
¶¶

02:52.006 --> 02:54.973
My own son,
a Godless heathen.

02:54.975 --> 02:57.643
Ehh, got to admit,
he made a few good points.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.945
That's it, hash Browns
for believers only.

02:59.947 --> 03:02.147
Okay, dad, if you're such
a good Christian,

03:02.149 --> 03:04.349
why weren't you
paying attention in church?

03:04.351 --> 03:05.984
'Cause I'm already
a believer.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.153
Religion solves all
the big problems for me.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.721
Life after death?
Solved!

03:09.723 --> 03:11.490
Meaning of existence?
Solved!

03:11.492 --> 03:14.459
Now I can spend my time
focusing on things I enjoy,

03:14.461 --> 03:16.995
like complaining about
the terrible service!

03:16.997 --> 03:18.363
What?!

03:18.365 --> 03:21.033
This place sucks.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.368
Now, back
to the big picture.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.571
Imagine life is like
a really hard class

03:25.573 --> 03:28.974
that you're for sure gonna fail,
but then you open your textbook,

03:28.976 --> 03:32.010
and you see some nerd wrote
all the answers in it for you.

03:32.012 --> 03:35.247
Well, this guy you've got
the balls to call a nerd?

03:35.249 --> 03:39.585
That's God,
and your textbook, the Bible.

03:39.587 --> 03:43.322
But it's just a bunch of crazy
folk tales and impossible stuff.

03:43.324 --> 03:46.391
Nonsense. Every word
of the Bible is 100% true.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.493
Oh, really?
And what makes you so sure?

03:48.495 --> 03:50.562
Because it's the greatest book
ever written.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.197
All the best stories
are in there.

03:52.199 --> 03:53.699
Noah's ark,
David and Goliath,

03:53.701 --> 03:55.767
the Princess and the pea,
"Steamboat Willie,"

03:55.769 --> 03:58.237
the story of the rabbit
who stole the children's cereal,

03:58.239 --> 04:00.906
the man who says,
"Now, that's a spicy meatball!"

04:02.343 --> 04:04.076
Uhh, Dad?

04:04.078 --> 04:07.045
Have you ever, you know,
actually<i> read</i> the Bible?

04:07.047 --> 04:09.715
Why would I? That's what
the talking guy at church does.

04:09.717 --> 04:12.217
If there was something
fishy in there, he'd
have caught it by now.

04:12.219 --> 04:13.885
He's obsessed
with that thing.

04:13.887 --> 04:16.255
Well, maybe you should
go read it.
Fine, I will.

04:16.257 --> 04:17.856
In fact,
I tell you what, Steve.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.358
We'll read
the Bible together.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.959
It's about time
someone instilled

04:20.961 --> 04:22.394
a little faith
into you.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.563
(scoffs) Please.
Faith is for suckers.

04:24.565 --> 04:27.532
(gasps dramatically)

04:27.534 --> 04:29.201
Stan?!

04:29.203 --> 04:31.303
(continues gasping)

04:31.305 --> 04:33.472
Daddy,
please stop gasping!

04:33.474 --> 04:34.806
(continues gasping)

04:41.715 --> 04:44.082
Here we are,
the family Bible.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.118
I see you got it
at Waldenbooks.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.619
Yes, Waldenbooks.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.488
Don't you have respect
for anything?

04:49.490 --> 04:51.823
No better place to start than
at the beginning.

04:51.825 --> 04:54.993
"In the beginning -- "
right spot, good start --

04:54.995 --> 04:57.162
"God created
the heavens and the Earth.

04:57.164 --> 05:00.632
On the first day, God separated
light and darkness."

05:00.634 --> 05:02.301
See? Simple enough.
-Hmm.

05:02.303 --> 05:04.670
Well, down here, it says
that on the fourth day,

05:04.672 --> 05:06.338
God created
the sun and stars.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.973
Tell me,
how could light exist

05:07.975 --> 05:09.941
before the sun and stars
were created?

05:09.943 --> 05:11.410
Well, there's got
to be an explanation.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.811
(snaps fingers)
And here it is.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.913
Probably God has lasers.
(lasers blasting)

05:18.085 --> 05:20.419
The Adam and Eve story.

05:20.421 --> 05:23.355
I defy you to find
even a single flaw with this.

05:23.357 --> 05:26.692
It says that Adam lived
to be 930 years old.

05:26.694 --> 05:29.127
That's a big number,
but you got to remember,

05:29.129 --> 05:30.662
this was before doctors,

05:30.664 --> 05:33.165
so cancer and that kind of stuff
didn't exist yet.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.700
Cain was married?

05:34.702 --> 05:36.601
How could Cain
possibly have had a wife

05:36.603 --> 05:38.870
when the only other people
in existence at the time

05:38.872 --> 05:40.439
were his parents
and brother?

05:40.441 --> 05:43.675
Steve, guys like Cain
always end up with the girl.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.711
Scratch that --
still makes no sense.

05:45.713 --> 05:49.014
Um, uh, might have
to come back to that one.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.818
The ark is filled with thousands
upon thousands of animals.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.787
How were each of them fed and
tended to by just eight people?

05:55.789 --> 05:57.889
Uh...

05:57.891 --> 06:01.126
And how did a dove return
with an Olive leaf,

06:01.128 --> 06:03.662
when no Olive tree
could possibly survive

06:03.664 --> 06:05.497
an apocalyptic flood?

06:05.499 --> 06:07.466
Oh, God, I don't know!

06:07.468 --> 06:09.801
And the ark --
a boat this size

06:09.803 --> 06:12.237
could never hold
two of every animal.

06:12.239 --> 06:13.905
The ark would have
to be, like,

06:13.907 --> 06:15.807
the size
of four baseball stadiums.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.042
(creaking)

06:17.044 --> 06:18.510
(cow mooing)
(monkey hooting)

06:18.512 --> 06:20.479
No boat that's big!
I'm drowning!

06:20.481 --> 06:21.980
I'm drowning
in your logic!

06:21.982 --> 06:23.882
Oh, God, my faith.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.385
Everything I believe,
it's all crazy.

06:26.387 --> 06:28.053
It's crazy baloney.

06:28.055 --> 06:31.490
It's not crazy baloney
because crazy baloney is real.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.925
It's called pepperoni.

06:39.333 --> 06:41.433
I don't know
who I am anymore.

06:41.435 --> 06:44.569
Without my faith,
I'm -- I'm nothing.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.171
That's not true.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.707
You're a husband, a father.
-That means nothing!

06:48.709 --> 06:52.444
Stan, maybe you don't need to be
so literal with the Bible.

06:52.446 --> 06:56.348
You know, a lot of people see it
as a set of instructive fables.

06:56.350 --> 06:58.717
Fables? You want me to base
my entire life

06:58.719 --> 07:00.619
on a bunch
of imaginary fairy tales?

07:00.621 --> 07:02.954
That would only make sense
if<i> I</i> was imaginary.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.756
The only problem is I'm real!

07:04.758 --> 07:07.125
I'm as real
as crazy baloney!

07:07.127 --> 07:08.693
(sobs)

07:12.733 --> 07:14.633
It's the end of the world!

07:14.635 --> 07:16.568
-I know.
-You heard, too?

07:16.570 --> 07:19.304
Kraft made their mac and cheese
even cheesier.

07:19.306 --> 07:20.772
I mean,
I haven't tried it yet,

07:20.774 --> 07:22.908
but I'm almost certain
it'll be too cheesy for me.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.376
What?! No!

07:24.378 --> 07:26.545
I lost my faith.
-Oh, that.

07:26.547 --> 07:27.979
Stan, I've been
telling you for years

07:27.981 --> 07:29.247
religion
was a load of bull.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.882
Why didn't you
ever listen to me?

07:30.884 --> 07:32.818
No one likes
to be ignored.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.753
You hurt my feelings,

07:34.755 --> 07:36.655
but I suppose
that's all in the past.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.824
I'm already over it!
-Good for you.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.959
Stan, wake up!
(clapping)

07:40.961 --> 07:42.227
Can't you see?

07:42.229 --> 07:43.662
Without the shackles
of religion,

07:43.664 --> 07:45.163
you're free to do
whatever you want.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.798
Break a commandment,
break all of 'em.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.099
How will that help?

07:48.101 --> 07:50.101
Uh, pleasure --
ever heard of it?

07:50.103 --> 07:51.470
Ever grokked it?

07:51.472 --> 07:53.839
Pleasure is the road
to happiness.

07:53.841 --> 07:56.942
People talk about filling
the void as if it's a bad thing.

07:56.944 --> 08:00.078
It's actually full
of nerve endings.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.348
Okay,
we'll start off small.

08:03.350 --> 08:06.117
Sneak over to the neighbor's
porch and steal the welcome mat.

08:06.119 --> 08:08.320
I don't know, that kind of
sounds like stealing.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.921
And thou shalt not do it,

08:09.923 --> 08:12.524
but that's why
it'll make you feel good.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.864
(giggling)

08:18.866 --> 08:20.465
Whoo,
that did feel good.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.801
Who needs God when you've got
this welcome mat?

08:22.803 --> 08:24.936
Welcome mat's
just the beginning.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.638
We're gonna go
way deeper.

very happy.

(sighs) I tried everything
to fill the void

09:26.233 --> 09:27.699
where my faith used
to be.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.100
I'm lost, Francine.

Everything
is meaningless.

Have you tried meditating?

09:32.706 --> 09:35.607
Hey, Tony, that mouth's not
for giving advice.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.375
Have you seen dad?

09:37.377 --> 09:39.010

09:41.248 --> 09:42.914
at Murray's
Discount Auto Store.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.182
Listen to me.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.184
Your father's
in really bad shape

09:46.186 --> 09:48.787
because of your big-shot ideas
about the Bible.

09:48.789 --> 09:52.591
So you need to find a way
to restore his faith real fast.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.192
Me?
I don't know what to do.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.261
You broke him,
you fix him!

09:56.263 --> 09:58.730
Oh, and stay out
of the basement.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.465
The furnace has been making

10:00.467 --> 10:04.202
a moaning and wet
slapping sound.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.705
(thunder booms)

10:06.707 --> 10:09.207
(keyboard clacking)

10:09.209 --> 10:10.642
Okay, great.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.877
I can just send him
to one of these camps.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.279
Oh.

10:14.281 --> 10:17.215
These are, uh,
gay conversion camps.

10:17.217 --> 10:20.652
Wait a minute,
is that Suck Boy Tony?

10:20.654 --> 10:23.655
(scoffs) They got their work
cut out for them.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.657
Dad?

10:27.961 --> 10:30.128
I've never seen him
like this before.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.564
He's just lying out there
in the pouring rain.

10:32.566 --> 10:35.800
(thunder booms)
The pouring rain!

10:35.802 --> 10:37.969
(keyboard clacking)

10:40.574 --> 10:42.641
It's all meaningless.

10:42.643 --> 10:46.611
There's no point to anything,
not even breathing.

10:46.613 --> 10:48.313
Last one.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.482
(inhales)

10:53.120 --> 10:54.486
(harp music plays)

10:54.488 --> 10:56.154
¶ Hallelujah ¶

10:56.156 --> 10:58.189
¶ Hallelujah ¶
God?

10:58.191 --> 11:00.959
Is that really you?
-No, son.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.528
I'm your brain cells
dying.

11:03.530 --> 11:06.831
You've now forgotten
the word zebra.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.299
(snaps fingers)
-Zebra?

11:08.301 --> 11:10.502
Big whoop. I never heard
that word in my life.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.444
(gasps)
Dad, come inside.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.779
I got something to show you.

11:20.781 --> 11:23.848
Look! It's a gigantic ship
in Korea.

11:23.850 --> 11:28.119
So?
And it's bigger
than four baseball stadiums.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.721
Like the ark.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.456
Wait, is this real?

11:31.458 --> 11:33.858
We thought it was impossible,
but here it is!

11:33.860 --> 11:37.495
So, the ark could be real,
and if the ark's real,

11:37.497 --> 11:39.531
everything else
just falls into place.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.332
-Well...
-I can have my faith!

11:41.334 --> 11:43.068
I can have my faith again!

11:43.070 --> 11:44.369
Stan, you're back!

11:44.371 --> 11:46.504
Of course, I am,
and better than ever.

11:46.506 --> 11:49.641
-(laughs)
-Whoo!

11:49.643 --> 11:52.410
I was hopeless for so long,
but now I can see that God

11:52.412 --> 11:54.679
was only testing
the strength of my faith.

11:54.681 --> 11:56.381
And you
passed the test.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.684
I did, so he revealed to me
through his instrument,

11:59.686 --> 12:02.987
Steve,
the location of the new ark.
Oh, no.

12:02.989 --> 12:05.757
Family, be at peace,
for we must get to the ark

12:05.759 --> 12:09.661
before the floods begin
because I am the new Noah.

12:09.663 --> 12:11.262
Stan?

12:11.264 --> 12:13.031
You've been depressed,

12:13.033 --> 12:17.402
and now you're just swinging
too far in the other direction.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.670
(dog barking)

12:18.672 --> 12:21.573
Listen!
It's a sign.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.241
-It's a bark.
-Exactly.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.609
B-ark!

12:24.611 --> 12:26.544
Just get rid of the "B."
Ark!

12:26.546 --> 12:29.280
(gasps) Wait!
Bring the letter "B" back.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.249
"B" on the ark.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.184
Absolutely hilarious.

12:33.186 --> 12:36.521
Sir, where have you been
all these years?

12:36.523 --> 12:38.523
<i> ¶ Hallelujah ¶</i>

12:38.525 --> 12:40.959
<i> ¶ Hallelujah ¶</i>
Lord, I shall go to Korea...

12:40.961 --> 12:43.061
<i> ¶ Hallelujah ¶</i>
...And carry out
your grand design.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.429
Look out, world!

12:44.431 --> 12:47.432
God and Stan
are back together again!

12:47.434 --> 12:51.102
It's not official till
you change your Facebook status!

12:55.275 --> 12:59.077
Look, dad actually thinks
he's Noah.
Don't worry.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.212
When he sees
that his ark is just

13:01.214 --> 13:04.249
a liquefied natural gas ship,
he'll snap out of it.

13:04.251 --> 13:07.252
And go back to being the dad,
husband, and paid killer

13:07.254 --> 13:09.788
for the U.S. government
we all know and love.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.656
What if this ark thing
is real?

13:11.658 --> 13:12.957
He'll need two goldfish.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.492
Do you think he'll choose me?

13:14.494 --> 13:16.561
Mm, I wouldn't.

13:18.465 --> 13:21.232
Stan...how's it going?

13:21.234 --> 13:23.902
You've just
been smiling peacefully

13:23.904 --> 13:25.436
for 20 hours straight.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.071
Well,
why wouldn't I be smiling?

13:27.073 --> 13:28.873
Everyone's about
to drown except us.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.749
Hey, watch it, buddy!

13:37.751 --> 13:39.083
You watch it.

13:39.085 --> 13:41.085
We have 40 tons
of overalls to unload.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.987
-Overalls?
-Whoa.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.455
You're into overalls,
too?

13:44.457 --> 13:45.990
I've been looking
for the perfect pair,

13:45.992 --> 13:47.492
but it's so hard to find
the right...

13:47.494 --> 13:48.960
Together:
...Chest pocket!

13:48.962 --> 13:52.363
Partner,
follow my lead.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.534
(whistling)

13:58.872 --> 14:00.338
Come on, Jeff!

14:00.340 --> 14:02.907
(whistling)

14:04.678 --> 14:07.512
There's no cone to kick!
-Just get in.

14:07.514 --> 14:11.749
I'll explain on the way why
a second cone isn't important.

14:15.021 --> 14:19.657
There it is --
the ark.

14:19.659 --> 14:21.392
What a sight!

14:21.394 --> 14:26.664
And the crescendo of emotions,
and then, satisfied,

14:26.666 --> 14:29.167
we're ready
to go back to the car.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.669
Are you joking?
No, we got to go on board.

14:31.671 --> 14:34.339
Dad, I'm pretty sure they're
not gonna let us do that.

14:34.341 --> 14:35.673
Man: Ahoy!

14:35.675 --> 14:37.342
Noah!

14:37.344 --> 14:39.611
We've been waiting for you!

14:41.581 --> 14:45.516
Hi, I'm Robert Kim
with Daesong Heavy Industries.

14:45.518 --> 14:49.387
I know it's kind of a shocker,
but this actually is the ark.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.357
God gave Daesong direct orders
to rebuild it.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.259
Well, then, what's the hold-up?
Let's get on board.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.693
Absolutely.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.262
First, though,
in order to get you ready

14:57.264 --> 14:58.730
for the flood,
we need to train you.

14:58.732 --> 15:02.233
Once again,
you're one step ahead.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.435
Sir, you can just follow
these fine folks here,

15:04.437 --> 15:07.272
and we will
get you set up.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.674
You're a great man!
Don't worry.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.542
We know he's not a great man,
and of course,

15:11.544 --> 15:13.344
of course
this isn't the ark.

15:13.346 --> 15:16.114
But -- you just --
and he --

15:16.116 --> 15:17.415
Allow me to explain.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.417
Daesong builds
a lot of big ships,

15:19.419 --> 15:21.619
and each time we do,
it attracts people

15:21.621 --> 15:24.722
who have what is known
as a Noah complex.
Like my dad?

15:24.724 --> 15:27.392
Lunatics like your father
can be a big nuisance,

15:27.394 --> 15:28.693
always sneaking on board,

15:28.695 --> 15:30.595
slithering around
the engine room.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.731
So we came up
with the Noah experience...
(fanfare plays)

15:33.733 --> 15:34.966
...designed
to make people feel like

15:34.968 --> 15:36.467
they're living
through the food.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.603
They go through it,
get it out of their systems,

15:38.605 --> 15:41.205
then everyone heads home
happy and safely away

15:41.207 --> 15:43.041
from our
very expensive ships.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.809
Now if you'll follow me,

15:44.811 --> 15:47.645
we have a wonderful assortment
of Pepperidge Farm cookies

15:47.647 --> 15:49.280
awaiting you
in the family lounge.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.615
Pepperidge Farm?

15:50.617 --> 15:52.417
Well, well, well.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.152
(smacks lips)

15:58.792 --> 16:00.725
(indistinct conversations)

16:00.727 --> 16:02.393
Who are these guys?

16:02.395 --> 16:03.962
Fellow ark seekers,
like yourself.

16:03.964 --> 16:07.899
So, who here is ready to start
our holy adventure?!

16:10.470 --> 16:13.938
Look out!
Here comes the storm!

16:13.940 --> 16:16.507
(thunder booms)

16:18.278 --> 16:19.510
-Whoo-hoo!
-Make it rain!

16:19.512 --> 16:21.279
-All right!
-Yay!

16:21.281 --> 16:23.081
-Yeah!
-All right!

16:23.083 --> 16:26.017
There's something
about this I'm not buying.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.653
Get your animals
to their pens!

16:28.655 --> 16:32.056
Go to your pen,
you striped horse!

16:33.526 --> 16:36.527
Hmm, got to admit
that felt pretty Noah-y.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.430
Now let's see if
the flood waters have receded.

16:44.537 --> 16:45.837
Hoo-ah!

16:45.839 --> 16:48.039
We survived the flood!

16:48.041 --> 16:49.607
It's over!

16:49.609 --> 16:51.275
We did it!

16:51.277 --> 16:53.444
Ark!

16:53.446 --> 16:56.547
-Pretty exciting.
-And it worked!

16:56.549 --> 16:57.815
-Yay!
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

16:57.817 --> 16:59.517
It weeded out
all the fake Noahs.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.119
-Aw, shit.
-Aw, shit.
-Aw, shit.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.487
So you're not
over this?

17:02.489 --> 17:04.188
The whole experience
was a sham!

17:04.190 --> 17:06.391
I mean, sure, the animatronics
were incredible.

17:06.393 --> 17:09.694
Yes, I had the time of my life,
and without question,

17:09.696 --> 17:11.496
these are
top-quality items --

17:11.498 --> 17:13.798
Things I'm going to keep
forever --

17:13.800 --> 17:15.566
But still,
I was lied to!

17:15.568 --> 17:18.069
Yeah, you shouldn't put up
with that!

17:18.071 --> 17:20.471
I know -- let's go home,

17:20.473 --> 17:23.875
and you take a bunch
of antipsychotic medication.

17:23.877 --> 17:26.411
That'll show 'em!
-No! This is happening!

17:26.413 --> 17:29.580
The flood is coming, and we are
going to be on that ark!

17:29.582 --> 17:32.183
Stan, come back!

17:32.185 --> 17:35.586
¶¶

17:35.588 --> 17:37.922
Time to do some Bible thumping!

17:37.924 --> 17:40.324
¶ The Lord said to Noah ¶

17:40.326 --> 17:42.427
¶ There's gonna be
a floody-floody ¶

17:42.429 --> 17:44.729
¶ The Lord said to Noah ¶

17:44.731 --> 17:47.031
¶ There's gonna be
a floody-floody ¶

17:47.033 --> 17:51.536
¶ Get those children
out of the muddy-muddy ¶

17:51.538 --> 17:55.339
¶ Children of the Lord ¶

17:55.341 --> 17:57.575
The ark is ours!

17:57.577 --> 17:59.744
Stan, we got to go.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.280
You just threw
the whole crew in the ocean.

18:02.282 --> 18:05.016
(laughs)

18:05.018 --> 18:06.184
Good work, Stan!

18:06.186 --> 18:07.585
Hey, it just occurred
to me.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.087
There were never fish
aboard the ark.

18:09.089 --> 18:10.621
They stayed
down in the water.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.391
No, no!

18:13.393 --> 18:16.294
You dipshit, there are [bleep]
sharks in there!

18:16.296 --> 18:17.829
(splashing)

18:19.065 --> 18:21.099
(creaking)
Mom, we got to get
out of here!

18:21.101 --> 18:23.634
What?! This is our home
for the next 40 days.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.403
Let's go check it out.
(clank)

18:25.405 --> 18:27.071
Steve,
this must be your room.

18:27.073 --> 18:29.774
Steve: Dad, this is a tank
for liquefied natural gas.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.276
And would you look
at those vaulted ceilings!

18:32.278 --> 18:35.046
Perfect for all
your Cheryl Tiegs posters!

18:35.048 --> 18:37.148
This is the room
where the pipes are.

18:37.150 --> 18:40.284
And this one is where
the extra pipes are.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.120
Oh, and this must be
the main pipe room.

18:42.122 --> 18:45.790
Pipes are very important
on a ship.

18:46.626 --> 18:51.229
Okay, here's the animals,
but still no master bedroom.

18:51.231 --> 18:54.732
There are animals here.
-No way.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.268
There has to be some
logical explanation.

18:57.270 --> 19:00.905
Ah, this manifest says these
animals are from the Busan Zoo

19:00.907 --> 19:03.241
being transported to
the National Zoo of Malaysia.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.842
See?
It all makes sense.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.745
Not really.
Even that is weird.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.080
Why would a zoo use

19:09.082 --> 19:11.449
a natural gas ship
to transport animals?

19:11.451 --> 19:12.750
Because...

19:12.752 --> 19:14.752
(sing-song voice]
we got overalls!

19:14.754 --> 19:16.487
(thunder booms)

19:16.489 --> 19:18.156
It's happening!

19:18.158 --> 19:19.757
We didn't miss nothing.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.192
Stan's still insane!

19:23.930 --> 19:25.763
We have to set sail now!

19:25.765 --> 19:28.466
Stop!
Think for a second!

19:28.468 --> 19:31.335
Are you really about
to steal a boat of animals

19:31.337 --> 19:33.004
and sail off into the ocean?

19:33.006 --> 19:35.773
Listen, I know everything
at this moment

19:35.775 --> 19:37.008
must look crazy to you.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.943
For the last
thousand moments.

19:38.945 --> 19:41.312
But I'm asking you,
all of you,

19:41.314 --> 19:45.550
to take this leap with me,
to have some faith.

19:47.453 --> 19:48.886
I'm staying.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.489
Steve, do you really think
this is the ark?

19:51.491 --> 19:53.157
Look, t-there's a lot
of weird stuff

19:53.159 --> 19:54.859
going on
that I can't explain.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.394
But you have faith.

19:56.396 --> 20:00.331
Yeah, but it's faith in you
'cause you're Dad.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.400
-Well, that's stupid.
-Thanks, Son.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.901
Francine?

20:03.903 --> 20:07.205
Well, I've seen
one miracle today.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.707
You've given Steve
some faith.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.876
That's enough
to make me stay.

20:11.878 --> 20:15.313
Plus, I'd like
to pet the Alpaca I saw.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.248
Hayley?

20:17.250 --> 20:18.849
What do you say,
baby girl?

20:18.851 --> 20:21.252
No way!
This is beyond crazy.

20:21.254 --> 20:23.421
I'll see you when
the police haul you in.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.223
(thunder booms)

20:25.225 --> 20:27.658
(Electricity crackling,
explosions)

20:27.660 --> 20:29.927
Start the damn boat!

20:29.929 --> 20:33.030
(lightning crashes)

20:33.032 --> 20:34.899
(screaming)

20:34.901 --> 20:37.001
Stan, I'm scared!

20:37.003 --> 20:40.504
Don't worry, after every ending
is a new beginning!

20:40.506 --> 20:41.806
Okay!

20:43.243 --> 20:45.009
Please, slow down!

20:45.011 --> 20:46.611
I'll never catch up!

20:46.613 --> 20:48.079
I'll die out here!

20:48.081 --> 20:50.114
(gasps) My bowl!

20:50.116 --> 20:51.682
(splash)

20:51.684 --> 20:54.452
I'll ride out the flood
in my own ark!

20:54.454 --> 20:58.055
Kiss my ass, Stan,
you crazy dick head!

20:58.057 --> 20:59.357
(gasps)

21:02.195 --> 21:04.161
Bye!
Have a beautiful time!
