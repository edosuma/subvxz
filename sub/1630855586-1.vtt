WEBVTT

00:11.762 --> 00:14.515
Here's our orb
It's slightly leaning

00:14.598 --> 00:16.308
Orbiting a star

00:17.059 --> 00:19.728
We find ways to give life meaning

00:19.811 --> 00:21.355
Some might seem bizarre

00:22.314 --> 00:24.566
All we know is that we exist

00:24.650 --> 00:27.528
And it won't be for long
So it helps to put some foot-tubes on

00:27.611 --> 00:29.863
Joy and sadness, courage and fear

00:29.947 --> 00:32.533
Curiosity and anger
On a planet full of danger

00:32.616 --> 00:34.993
And it's only getting stranger
From here

00:44.086 --> 00:47.422
Long ago, our species decided
there could be comfort in the air.

00:47.506 --> 00:48.674
You appear uncomfortable.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.384
Because I am not in the air.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.927
And so, we ascended.

00:52.010 --> 00:55.430
The first flying machines' passengers
were limited to two sensations.

00:55.514 --> 00:57.891
I may die! I may not die!

00:58.976 --> 01:01.812
As flying machines became
larger and stayed in the air longer,

01:01.895 --> 01:03.814
the range of sensations expanded.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.190
I may never die.

01:05.274 --> 01:06.650
I'd love some tiny snacks.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.111
And so, we got even better at flying.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.697
Juice options distract me
from my fear of perishing.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.448
I wish I were next to the window.

01:13.532 --> 01:15.492
Now, flying machines tend
to stay in the air,

01:15.576 --> 01:18.871
filled with beings like you
experiencing many sensations,

01:18.954 --> 01:22.499
including indecision, jealousy,
and even inspiration.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.210
Note that this flying machine
is designed to stay intact,

01:25.294 --> 01:27.462
even if it emergency plops onto liquid.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.715
If your seat is in the peril row,

01:29.798 --> 01:31.633
you must help us take the machine apart.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.802
Your reward is more leg room.

01:33.886 --> 01:36.096
Please refer to the danger menu
in your seat pocket

01:36.180 --> 01:38.140
for further tips on how not to die.

01:38.223 --> 01:41.185
These safety precautions will ensure
that this flight is both comfortable

01:41.268 --> 01:42.769
and free of fatalities.

01:42.853 --> 01:46.023
Enjoy flying in comfort
and statistically probable survival.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.153
Yeah, just scoot over one. Thank you.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.280
Excuse me?

01:54.990 --> 01:56.533
There's no room.

02:02.456 --> 02:05.000
Your comfort supervisor will
now wheel a container through the machine

02:05.083 --> 02:07.294
and toss a tiny snack
onto your pretend table.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.342
-Tiny snack?
-It's so small.

02:13.425 --> 02:14.801
Is mild poison available?

02:14.885 --> 02:17.137
Yes, if you can prove
you've existed long enough.

02:19.806 --> 02:20.807
That's me.

02:20.891 --> 02:23.352
Are you flying
to the Sadlands Music Festival?

02:23.435 --> 02:24.353
How did you know?

02:24.436 --> 02:27.022
Well, I see my favorite band is punctured
on your limbs.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.859
Wow! You got all of them there.

02:30.943 --> 02:34.947
This will be our 14th time seeing
The Four Sensations together.

02:35.030 --> 02:37.366
Their melodies are the saddest.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.535
Yes. We listen to them when we are sad,

02:39.618 --> 02:42.454
and this compounds our sadness,
which makes us happy.

02:42.538 --> 02:44.706
There's a button up here you can press
if you feel discomfort.

02:45.958 --> 02:46.959
Enjoy.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.507
I have many discomforts.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.758
Start with the worst one.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.218
I am hungry.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.719
Plural tiny snacks.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.388
These snacks will make me thirsty.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.058
I am also cold.

03:03.141 --> 03:05.978
The cold air is blasting on you.
You can reduce it.

03:06.061 --> 03:09.189
I like the air but do not want to be cold.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.234
Have I met your expectations?

03:12.317 --> 03:13.944
There is one more discomfort.

03:14.027 --> 03:17.990
The star is in my eyes, and I am reluctant
to reach over this being and--

03:19.324 --> 03:21.743
You are a great
flying machine comfort supervisor.

03:22.286 --> 03:23.120
Gratitude.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.250
A beverage collision.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.919
To another successful
flying machine trip.

03:31.003 --> 03:34.006
Our job challenges and rewards us.

03:34.089 --> 03:36.175
-It challenges us more than you.
-What?

03:36.258 --> 03:39.136
-You're the best at comforting.
-You are equally good at it.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.806
Thank you. Hey, you just comforted me.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.016
It's what we do.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.100
All of us.

03:46.018 --> 03:47.978
And you've never once been summoned
to corporate.

03:49.313 --> 03:50.731
You've been summoned to corporate.

04:16.839 --> 04:17.673
Apologies.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.844
It must appear that I am changing my mind
about using this pen.

04:22.221 --> 04:23.222
I don't understand.

04:24.348 --> 04:26.600
The clicking.
It is an unconscious behavior.

04:27.226 --> 04:28.227
Not anymore.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.853
Which is why I stopped.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.898
Congratulations.

04:34.316 --> 04:36.360
Here's why you've been summoned.

04:36.443 --> 04:40.864
Our data indicates you handle
your responsibilities quite well.

04:41.406 --> 04:45.452
We have chosen to reward you
with more responsibility.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.749
Your scarf is changing color
to denote your new status.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.961
You are now
the air comfort supervisor supervisor.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.257
Obviously the scarf will not change
in function.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.717
What is the scarf's function?

05:00.801 --> 05:04.388
Well, unless your neck is cold, none.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.152
I ride your group roll machine daily.

05:19.695 --> 05:22.948
In case you didn't recognize me
because my scarf has changed.

05:23.532 --> 05:26.410
You got a vocational upgrade?
On the flying machine?

05:26.493 --> 05:28.245
Yes! I was a comfort supervisor,

05:28.328 --> 05:31.456
and now
I'm a comfort supervisor supervisor.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.000
Congratulations.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.711
You're the boss
of the whole vehicle now, like me.

05:35.794 --> 05:36.670
Any advice?

05:36.753 --> 05:39.673
You know, I always tell
new group roll machine operators,

05:39.756 --> 05:42.092
"Remember, you are also a passenger.

05:42.176 --> 05:45.596
If there's a bump in the roll path,
we are all going to feel it together."

05:47.931 --> 05:51.185
I rolled over that bump intentionally
to demonstrate.

05:51.268 --> 05:52.895
I felt that bump too.

05:52.978 --> 05:56.440
It's like we are the same
in our capacity to feel.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.566
-Yeah, okay.
-Wise.

05:57.649 --> 05:58.942
Yeah, great.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.861
Today is one of my favorite days.

06:03.447 --> 06:05.115
And now my favorite song is playing.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.327
Let's make everyone hear it,
regardless of their preference.

06:09.161 --> 06:13.457
I feel like I've been crushed
Under a group roll machine

06:13.540 --> 06:18.003
Is this because of love
Or maybe tainted cuisine

06:18.086 --> 06:22.090
Losing you was always
My most intimate fear

06:22.174 --> 06:25.344
My comfort square is covered in crumbs

06:25.427 --> 06:31.141
-And drowning in tears
-Tears

06:31.225 --> 06:34.811
There's crumbs and there's tears
A bunch of crumbs and they're all wet

06:34.895 --> 06:39.358
-'Cause of tears
-Tears

06:39.441 --> 06:41.735
I'm chewing in my rest slab

06:41.818 --> 06:46.823
To soothe me
While I'm drowning in tears

06:46.907 --> 06:48.992
Thank you, Sadlands Music Festival.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.994
We are The Four Sensations.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.247
I'm Lonely, this is Fragile,

06:53.330 --> 06:56.583
and on the push tones,
we've got Hung Up On Their Ex.

06:59.378 --> 07:00.587
And I'm Drum.

07:00.671 --> 07:03.006
Drum, Drum, Drumâ€¦

07:03.590 --> 07:05.092
You've been an amazing audience.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.094
Those are all the melodies we know.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.178
Go home!

07:11.682 --> 07:16.353
Insincere, insincere, insincere.

07:19.273 --> 07:22.609
You've uncovered our deception.
We do know more music.

07:26.572 --> 07:29.408
One, two, three, let's cry!

07:34.580 --> 07:36.665
Amazing crowd of beings last night.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.041
Incredible.

07:39.918 --> 07:42.671
Beings, I need to discuss a matter
with you.

07:42.754 --> 07:46.175
I have a positive update
and a negative update.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.635
Give us the negative update first.

07:48.719 --> 07:51.221
And that is why I can no longer be part
of this band.

07:54.266 --> 07:57.769
We now realize the positive update
provides crucial context.

07:57.853 --> 07:59.563
I've tumbled into love.

07:59.646 --> 08:00.564
With my ex?

08:00.647 --> 08:03.358
Of course not.
Bandmates before hand mates.

08:03.442 --> 08:07.321
We actually met as young beings.
We've found each other again.

08:09.072 --> 08:13.285
So, you see, if I go on stage
and tell our fans I'm Lonely,

08:13.827 --> 08:15.954
they'll sense that it's a deception.

08:16.038 --> 08:17.289
The joy of my new union

08:17.372 --> 08:21.001
leaves me reluctant to perform melodies
that simulate sadness.

08:21.502 --> 08:25.214
I understand if this news causes actual,
unsimulated sadness.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.428
We will certainly miss having you
in the band.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.138
We're happy that you're happy.

08:33.222 --> 08:37.308
And there will be benefits. For example,
the group can now be on time for things.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.020
Was I the least punctual member?

08:40.102 --> 08:41.647
You were the least predictable.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.690
You still are. For example,

08:43.774 --> 08:47.653
you're announcing your departure
from the band over crisscross floppers.

08:48.612 --> 08:50.948
I regret that I don't know how to depart.

08:51.615 --> 08:54.535
I will always hope
for your continued success and happiness.

08:54.618 --> 08:56.411
You will always be in my thoughts.

08:57.538 --> 08:59.456
I didn't bring currency for breakfast.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.209
We have enough.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.672
If only we were enough.

09:14.805 --> 09:16.765
The Three Sensations?

09:16.849 --> 09:20.185
Observe. The lead melody-creator
of The Four Sensations,

09:20.269 --> 09:22.020
mouth pushing a mystery being.

09:22.104 --> 09:23.689
Mouth pushing so gratifying

09:23.772 --> 09:27.526
that the melody creator is quitting
to focus on it exclusively.

09:27.609 --> 09:32.197
Reactions from fans at the Sadlands
Music Festival were predictably sad.

09:32.281 --> 09:34.116
Can you share your lousy feelings?

09:34.199 --> 09:35.951
We feel devastation.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.953
Their music defined our relationship.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.705
I don't know how we'll continue.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.373
-You don't?
-You do?

09:41.456 --> 09:44.209
I think the orb will keep spinning.

09:44.293 --> 09:46.670
We're sad,
but we'll find a new favorite band.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.422
Will we? How?

09:48.505 --> 09:50.674
By listening to new music.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.426
We have their faces on us.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.220
Despite your curiosity
about the unfolding intrigue,

09:55.304 --> 09:57.973
we will give these beings privacy
to resolve this.

10:02.853 --> 10:05.981
Are we gonna resolve this?

10:06.648 --> 10:09.234
Resolve what, exactly?

10:09.318 --> 10:13.363
The music that links us has ceased
to exist forever.

10:13.447 --> 10:14.907
And you're okay with that?

10:15.407 --> 10:18.368
There is so much music out there.

10:18.911 --> 10:22.873
There's the Mediocre Music Fest
near my life-givers' house this week.

10:23.498 --> 10:25.751
We could go together
and try to find a new band.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.503
I don't want a new band.

10:28.712 --> 10:30.589
I'm seriously confused.

10:30.672 --> 10:33.759
There must be more to this
than just a band breaking up.

10:36.595 --> 10:38.805
Is discomfort present presently?

10:38.889 --> 10:39.890
Yes.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.475
May I have a comfort square?

10:41.558 --> 10:45.062
Apologies. The comfort squares
are dispersed at the launch of the flight.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.396
Tiny snack?

10:46.480 --> 10:47.481
Okay?

10:49.858 --> 10:51.235
A comfort square for you.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.528
Gratitude.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.071
Let's converse less publicly.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.991
You're permitted
to disperse comfort squares on request.

10:58.075 --> 11:00.202
Yeah, I try to avoid running out.

11:00.285 --> 11:03.080
I prefer to exhaust
all comfort squares every flight.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.165
It means comfort was maximized.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.417
Gratitude for the correction.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.713
Are you comfortable?

11:11.797 --> 11:14.466
-Very much.
-That means a passenger isn't.

11:14.550 --> 11:16.093
I mean, the passengers press the button

11:16.176 --> 11:19.179
-when they--
-When they have already felt discomfort.

11:19.263 --> 11:22.140
Our job is to prevent that
before it occurs.

11:22.766 --> 11:24.643
Gratitude for the correction.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.032
Long flight.

11:39.575 --> 11:42.077
Hi, I will have my usual mild poison.

11:43.704 --> 11:46.665
Are you ingesting mild poison here?

11:46.748 --> 11:47.749
We usually do.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.711
We usually express
our work frustrations here.

11:51.753 --> 11:55.048
And I am now your work frustration.

11:55.674 --> 11:56.675
Accurate.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.515
You are still within hearing range.

12:03.599 --> 12:05.684
It defeats the purpose of separation.

12:06.685 --> 12:07.686
Makes sense.

12:10.355 --> 12:14.359
I bumped. Sorry.
That one's on me there, table.

12:14.443 --> 12:17.279
Ouch! Sharp little corner there.

12:17.362 --> 12:22.159
Just gonna scooch this a little
and sit here.

12:23.202 --> 12:24.870
Great.

12:31.502 --> 12:34.713
It would be absurd to separate
because a band separated.

12:34.796 --> 12:37.966
Maybe the band separating
is making us rethink what we're doing.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.678
I'm going to stay at my life-givers'
for a while.

12:42.179 --> 12:44.932
It'll give me a chance
to cleanse my foot fabric-tubes.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.732
I wanna keep
the commemorative beverage cylinders.

12:54.608 --> 12:58.737
You always loved the cylinders
and the way they contained beverages.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.752
Well, you can't do much with one.
Look at these two here.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.754
They are perfect for each other.

13:15.838 --> 13:19.550
I agree.
It's so sad when you break up a pair.

13:20.175 --> 13:22.386
That one looks especially dejected.

13:24.304 --> 13:28.183
Having trouble dealing
With the loss of a collaborator

13:28.267 --> 13:31.895
They were a friend
So we still wanna congratulate or

13:31.979 --> 13:36.108
Mention that we're happy for them
Knowing we'll be sadder later

13:36.191 --> 13:38.819
'Cause what are we without them

13:39.319 --> 13:42.364
Our band is really awful without them

13:44.491 --> 13:46.743
Greetings, Sensations. Successful?

13:46.827 --> 13:47.870
It's questionable.

13:47.953 --> 13:49.079
Here is better news.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.373
There are 200 beings celebrating
something or other,

13:51.456 --> 13:53.625
and they are huge fans
of The Four Sensations

13:53.709 --> 13:56.128
and would love to fly you out
to play or something like that.

13:56.211 --> 13:59.381
We would first like to attempt
to be good on our own, making new songs.

13:59.464 --> 14:02.217
I thought you just tried that and failed.

14:02.301 --> 14:03.385
We don't need to give up

14:03.468 --> 14:06.221
just because we failed
to instantly create a wonderful song.

14:06.722 --> 14:11.476
Wait.
This real feeling of anger and tension,

14:11.560 --> 14:14.062
this is what we need
to write our song about.

14:14.146 --> 14:15.689
Sounds fun?

14:15.772 --> 14:18.525
Yeah. Use that. One, two, three, go.

14:18.609 --> 14:22.613
We've been disassembled
Like a two-wheel foot pusher

14:22.696 --> 14:26.491
If it had four wheels
And then one wheel fell off

14:30.162 --> 14:32.998
Hey! How's the new job going?

14:33.790 --> 14:36.418
My comfort has always derived
from the comfort of others,

14:36.502 --> 14:40.422
but now I'm the source
of my friends' discomfort.

14:41.215 --> 14:43.091
You can't forget to comfort yourself.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.636
Have you tried screaming?

14:46.220 --> 14:48.180
My job is to prevent screams.

14:49.014 --> 14:50.474
Try right now.

14:52.434 --> 14:55.187
I cannot bring myself to scream
on your group roll machine.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.571
Come on. Give it a try.

15:04.655 --> 15:07.449
Don't worry, everybody.
Just screaming for comfort.

15:08.283 --> 15:09.368
-Okay, cool. Great.
-Nice.

15:09.952 --> 15:10.953
Try it.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.040
I know you can improve on that.

15:18.544 --> 15:22.005
Unpleasant emotions!

15:23.674 --> 15:25.425
See? How does that feel?

15:26.009 --> 15:31.515
I feel like maybe I make a better
passenger than a comfort supervisor.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.225
Don't be hard on yourself.

15:33.308 --> 15:35.102
Loudness takes practice.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.396
Like-- Drum!

15:39.773 --> 15:44.862
Oh, no
Will my fractures start to show?

15:46.780 --> 15:50.659
Can my sadness overflow?

15:52.411 --> 15:56.832
Were my best days long ago?

15:57.958 --> 16:02.629
Is my future filled with woe?

16:03.672 --> 16:08.135
Did my happiness plateau?

16:09.261 --> 16:13.140
Will there be a tomorrow?

16:14.099 --> 16:17.561
Have I lost all my cargo?

16:18.896 --> 16:22.441
Yeah. We're ready to give up.

16:23.066 --> 16:26.862
This is good news to me.
And it will be to you too, I think.

16:26.945 --> 16:29.323
It means The Sensations are getting
back on the road.

16:29.406 --> 16:30.991
Where's the performance?

16:31.074 --> 16:32.701
Very, very far away.

16:32.784 --> 16:36.121
So far away that it will cost as much
to fly there as you receive in payment.

16:36.205 --> 16:37.873
We don't do this for profit.

16:37.956 --> 16:40.667
Then we are all doing our jobs very well.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.799
The Four Sensations.

16:47.883 --> 16:50.010
You are my favorite creators
of sad sounds.

16:50.093 --> 16:54.139
We are now The Three Sensations
and no longer capable of pleasing you.

16:54.223 --> 16:56.975
That is confusing and regrettable.
Comfort squares?

16:57.059 --> 17:00.354
There's no square capable
of comforting us now.

17:03.148 --> 17:04.691
That was great when that happened.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.359
I also loved it.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.948
You don't need to behave differently
every time I'm near.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.282
We accept your theory and have our own.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.954
I used to be happy
and make everyone around me happy.

17:17.579 --> 17:19.830
This promotion has made everything bad.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.041
We agree.

17:23.544 --> 17:24.545
Mild turbulence.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.128
Prioritize passenger comfort.

17:27.047 --> 17:27.964
Comfort squares?

17:28.048 --> 17:30.259
-Is the flying machine dismantling?
-It is not.

17:30.342 --> 17:32.010
If it were, would you tell us?

17:32.094 --> 17:33.679
We are here to ensure your comfort.

17:33.762 --> 17:36.723
That response is vague
and I could interpret it as negative.

17:36.807 --> 17:39.351
I have so far not deceived
and I'm moving on to other challenges.

17:39.434 --> 17:40.269
Thank you.

17:40.352 --> 17:42.354
The ordinary function of a flying machine

17:42.437 --> 17:45.190
includes many increases
and decreases in altitude.

17:45.274 --> 17:49.778
But the flying machine should only fall
at the end of a trip,

17:49.862 --> 17:52.573
-slowly and on purpose.
-Correct.

17:52.656 --> 17:54.908
So why is it plummeting now?

17:54.992 --> 17:59.997
-This is unintentional.
-The machine is not doing as intended!

18:00.080 --> 18:01.748
If there were any chance of death,

18:01.832 --> 18:03.959
we would not be serving beverages
and snacks.

18:04.042 --> 18:06.587
Comfort supervisors,
cease all beverage and snack service

18:06.670 --> 18:08.505
and secure yourselves to the walls.

18:08.589 --> 18:10.716
-I will be back.
-Oh, Lorb.

18:11.967 --> 18:15.137
-We're attempting to comfort best we can.
-You have fulfilled that purpose.

18:15.220 --> 18:18.015
They are clearly the least comfortable
passengers in the history of flying.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.892
It's time for you to be comforted.

18:19.975 --> 18:23.270
Strap in.
You have both done a perfect job.

18:23.353 --> 18:24.855
Are you saying that to comfort us?

18:24.938 --> 18:27.691
If I were gifted at deception,
wouldn't we still be friends?

18:36.241 --> 18:40.454
Passengers of this flight,
I am the comfort supervisor supervisor.

18:40.537 --> 18:43.874
I oversee all the comfort
on this entire flying machine.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.501
We are eager to see you succeed.

18:45.584 --> 18:46.793
So am I.

18:46.877 --> 18:49.004
This announcement is discomforting.

18:49.713 --> 18:50.547
Irony.

18:50.631 --> 18:52.508
-Is that irony?
-I'm never sure.

18:52.591 --> 18:53.800
Here's the difficult thing:

18:53.884 --> 18:57.679
Honesty can be discomforting
and comfort can make us dishonest.

18:57.763 --> 19:00.974
For example, I thought you were
the greatest band in the world.

19:01.058 --> 19:03.185
-"Were"?
-Apologies for word selection.

19:03.268 --> 19:05.771
I love my job
and I've always been good at it

19:05.854 --> 19:08.190
because I'm good at enduring discomfort,

19:08.273 --> 19:10.442
which is not always the right thing to do.

19:13.403 --> 19:14.488
All right.

19:15.239 --> 19:19.201
I am very, very uncomfortable right now.

19:19.284 --> 19:21.912
The flying machine
is behaving uncontrollably.

19:21.995 --> 19:25.874
I can either hide that discomfort
and ask you to hide your own,

19:25.958 --> 19:28.168
or we can share it together.

19:28.252 --> 19:32.840
Because whatever is going
to happen is going to happen to us all.

19:32.923 --> 19:38.136
So, my suggestion is, we scream.

19:40.597 --> 19:42.599
No, it can be very comforting.

19:42.683 --> 19:44.309
Here. I'll do it first.

19:48.438 --> 19:49.565
You try it.

19:51.108 --> 19:55.487
I think you can do better than that.
I think you are genuinely terrified.

19:55.571 --> 19:59.408
Imagine the possibility
of everything being over.

19:59.491 --> 20:03.036
Think about all the regrets you'd have,
and scream.

20:07.124 --> 20:10.669
I am particularly disappointed
in the terror expressed from this section.

20:10.752 --> 20:14.339
These beings are supposed
to be professional expressers of emotion.

20:14.423 --> 20:17.259
Listen to their fear. It's really sad.

20:17.342 --> 20:18.927
Scream!

20:20.846 --> 20:23.473
There we go. What are those?

20:23.974 --> 20:26.685
Did you bring those instruments
for decoration or do they have a function?

20:26.768 --> 20:28.228
Show us what you got.

20:30.898 --> 20:34.109
I don't wanna die

20:34.193 --> 20:37.029
My blood pump is engaged
And now I'm ready to fly

20:37.112 --> 20:38.363
'Cause falling can be scary

20:38.447 --> 20:40.616
But what's even worse
Is wasted potential

20:40.699 --> 20:42.826
I believe in my potential

20:42.910 --> 20:45.162
I would like to land on my feet

20:45.245 --> 20:48.165
And I express this
To communicate the feeling I need

20:48.248 --> 20:52.336
Because the highest form of comfort
Is to focus on your own essentials

20:52.419 --> 20:54.546
I am feeling existential

20:54.630 --> 20:57.090
Everybody's screaming now
Because we're afraid

20:57.174 --> 20:59.676
But let's confront our own mortality
On some other day

20:59.760 --> 21:00.677
I wanna live

21:00.761 --> 21:03.597
-I wanna live as long as possible
-Let's live!

21:03.680 --> 21:06.642
-I wanna live as long as possible
-Let's live!

21:06.725 --> 21:11.522
I wanna live
As long as I possibly can now

21:11.605 --> 21:12.731
Let's live!

21:12.814 --> 21:15.234
-I wanna live as long as possible
-Let's live!

21:15.317 --> 21:18.362
-I wanna live as long as possible
-Let's live!

21:18.445 --> 21:23.200
I wanna live
As long as I possibly can now

21:23.283 --> 21:24.326
Let's live!

21:31.166 --> 21:32.543
Definitely not dead.

21:32.626 --> 21:35.170
Comfort supervisors,
you are free to untether from the wall

21:35.254 --> 21:36.797
and distribute mild poison.

21:38.048 --> 21:40.759
Actually, give 'em
whatever poison they want.

21:40.843 --> 21:41.844
Afterward,

21:41.927 --> 21:44.012
we would like
to ingest mild poison with you.

21:44.638 --> 21:45.973
I look forward to it.

21:46.807 --> 21:49.142
-I wanna live!
-I wanna liveâ€¦

21:49.226 --> 21:52.437
That is "I Don't Wanna Die,"
the number-one melody in the region.

21:52.521 --> 21:55.065
I have here with me
newly-renamed melody creators,

21:55.148 --> 21:56.984
The Infinite Sensations.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.986
Beings, why the name change?

21:59.069 --> 22:00.946
Well, there were 67 beings

22:01.029 --> 22:03.323
on the flying machine
when we came up with our new sound.

22:03.407 --> 22:06.994
And we realized there's a lot
of ways to feel. Sixty-seven, at least.

22:07.077 --> 22:10.414
It hardly mattered what you said
because I'm increasing the volume.

22:20.132 --> 22:21.216
Greetings.

22:21.300 --> 22:24.761
Greetings.
How was the Mediocre Music Fest?

22:24.845 --> 22:26.221
It was meh.

22:27.389 --> 22:31.143
I would have enjoyed it if I had
been there with you.

22:31.727 --> 22:33.562
I would have really liked that.

22:35.898 --> 22:37.774
Is it an annual thing?

22:38.317 --> 22:39.818
Let's find out.
