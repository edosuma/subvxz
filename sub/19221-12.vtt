09:09.579 --> 09:11.145
And I'm proud of you.

09:11.147 --> 09:14.215
Really? (laughs)

09:14.217 --> 09:16.684
All right, that's... thank...
'cause I... this whole time,

09:16.686 --> 09:18.819
I-I didn't think you
wanted me to be an artist.

09:18.821 --> 09:21.222
I don't.

09:21.224 --> 09:23.524
I mean, but you got
yourself an actual job.

09:23.526 --> 09:24.925
You know, by now,

09:24.927 --> 09:26.932
I thought you'd be living
in your grandmama's basement,

09:26.971 --> 09:29.230
eating her cookies
and trimming her beard.

09:31.501 --> 09:32.368
Hey, Mr. Wicks.

09:32.423 --> 09:35.069
Uh, I'm Franco's boss,
Arthur Przybyszewski.

09:35.071 --> 09:37.371
(chuckles) The man
who gave my boy a job.

09:37.373 --> 09:38.806
God bless you.

09:38.808 --> 09:41.175
Well, look, I'm really
lucky to have him.

09:41.177 --> 09:42.777
How about this art exhibit?

09:42.779 --> 09:44.378
It's pretty impressive, huh?

09:44.380 --> 09:47.448
Yeah, yeah, I guess
so, if you want a hobby.

09:47.450 --> 09:48.979
You know, I actually used to collect

09:48.988 --> 09:50.588
all the state's quarters.

09:50.594 --> 09:54.028
And then, I would use them
for laundry. (chuckles)

09:54.323 --> 09:58.359
Wisconsin gets your whites the whitest.

09:59.562 --> 10:02.463
Well, Dad, my-my art
is-is more than a hobby.

10:02.465 --> 10:03.731
REGGIE: Oh.

10:03.733 --> 10:05.232
Really?

10:05.234 --> 10:07.068
So how many of these have you sold?

10:07.070 --> 10:07.848
Today?

10:07.949 --> 10:10.171
Ever.

10:10.173 --> 10:13.274
Hey, Reggie, let me
show you a really, uh...

10:13.276 --> 10:15.073
this is my favorite painting over here.

10:15.167 --> 10:18.412
You know that Jesus could skateboard?

10:18.414 --> 10:20.114
Yeah.

10:20.116 --> 10:22.616
The man could walk on water.
Of course he could skateboard.

10:22.618 --> 10:24.051
Yeah.

10:25.788 --> 10:27.254
Still tooting your horn?

10:27.256 --> 10:28.823
Oh, shut up.

10:30.860 --> 10:33.194
Well, maybe when he
gets a look at your art,

10:33.196 --> 10:34.895
- he'll come around.
- (scoffs, laughs)

10:34.897 --> 10:36.530
You haven't dealt with Reggie Wicks.

10:36.532 --> 10:38.507
He thinks all this is a waste of time.

10:38.577 --> 10:41.402
Oh, you can't win with parents.

10:41.404 --> 10:44.805
I became a cop like my dad
to try to get his approval.

10:44.807 --> 10:46.574
And he never gave it.

10:46.576 --> 10:48.642
I remember, on his deathbed,

10:48.644 --> 10:52.747
he finally pulled me
close and he said, "Go..."

10:52.749 --> 10:54.682
Cubs."

10:54.684 --> 10:57.418
- Ooh, that's rough.
- Yeah.

10:57.420 --> 11:00.621
I almost buried his ass
in a White Sox uniform.

11:01.691 --> 11:03.524
You know something, if I could just sell

11:03.526 --> 11:05.059
one of these paintings, then my dad

11:05.061 --> 11:07.128
would have to admit my art is for real.

11:08.931 --> 11:11.532
Let's go. (clears throat)

11:11.534 --> 11:13.740
(in deep voice): Hello.

11:13.771 --> 11:15.670
Uh, you like what you see?

11:15.802 --> 11:18.305
I do. It's great.

11:18.307 --> 11:20.541
Oh, well, you want to buy it?

11:20.543 --> 11:21.809
No, I'm just looking.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.477
But the use of perspective is really...

11:23.479 --> 11:24.879
Yeah, whatever.

11:26.783 --> 11:29.049
Hey, guys, I think he's
gonna need our help.

11:29.051 --> 11:31.152
Well, maybe a couple
of us should swing by,

11:31.154 --> 11:33.788
talk to that gallery owner,
see if she'll come by.

11:33.790 --> 11:36.524
Oh, yeah. And then, maybe
if she liked Franco's art,

11:36.526 --> 11:40.060
she'd offer him a show and
get his dad off his back.

11:40.062 --> 11:43.330
Come on, Fawz. This is
a job for the Dapper Duo.

11:45.401 --> 11:48.235
Do not call us that.

11:48.237 --> 11:52.807
Blazer Boys? Guys in
Ties? Brutes in Suits?

11:52.809 --> 11:55.476
Blazer Boys is fine.

12:00.049 --> 12:03.150
Oh, look at this piece.
The brush strokes...

12:03.152 --> 12:05.419
there are so many of them.

12:07.356 --> 12:09.290
It's stunning, but I
don't find it as arresting

12:09.292 --> 12:13.027
as the pieces we saw at Superior Donuts.

12:13.029 --> 12:15.563
"Arresting," nice. Very douchey.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.332
May I help you, gentlemen?

12:18.334 --> 12:20.935
I don't know.

12:20.937 --> 12:23.070
Nothing here is speaking to us

12:23.072 --> 12:25.915
like the Franco Wicks show
we saw down the street.

12:26.055 --> 12:29.410
Oh, is that the thing
at the, um, donut shop?

12:29.412 --> 12:31.078
Yeah. You should check it out.

12:31.080 --> 12:35.449
That place has some fine
quality, durable art.

12:35.451 --> 12:38.519
Yeah, I don't think so.

12:38.521 --> 12:41.322
No, but perhaps I can
show you two something

12:41.324 --> 12:44.191
that you'll both be happy
to hang in your home.

12:45.795 --> 12:47.461
<i>Our</i> home?

12:47.463 --> 12:49.630
I can see how you might be confused,

12:49.632 --> 12:51.131
but we're not a couple.

12:51.133 --> 12:53.367
Yeah. And if I were going to be gay,

12:53.369 --> 12:56.103
I think I could do better than this.

12:57.640 --> 12:59.579
You'd be lucky to have me.

12:59.665 --> 13:03.577
Please. You look like
Dolly Parton's bodyguard.

13:05.848 --> 13:08.482
All right, well, if it helps,

13:08.484 --> 13:10.885
I find you both unappealing.

13:10.887 --> 13:12.920
Excuse me.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.555
Have you seen me shirtless?

13:14.557 --> 13:16.257
I can get any man I want.

13:16.259 --> 13:18.158
Any man!

13:18.160 --> 13:19.960
You wish.

13:23.099 --> 13:25.399
Well, that did not go well.

13:27.403 --> 13:30.738
That woman's gaydar is way off.

13:32.174 --> 13:34.241
REGGIE: You know what your problem is?

13:34.243 --> 13:35.342
I think you done priced

13:35.344 --> 13:37.011
these little pictures you drew too high.

13:37.013 --> 13:40.414
Why would anybody spend
$80 on a picture of weed,

13:40.416 --> 13:44.318
when they could spend $80 on weed?

13:45.988 --> 13:48.422
You know, I think I made a mistake

13:48.432 --> 13:50.174
inviting Franco's dad.

13:50.214 --> 13:52.927
Well, the important thing is: your
heart was in the right place.

13:52.929 --> 13:54.995
- Mm-hmm.
- Your head is just up your ass.

13:54.997 --> 13:56.664
Hmm?

13:56.666 --> 13:59.600
I mean, maybe I should
tell him that I did it.

13:59.602 --> 14:02.142
How'd you get it further up there?

14:03.139 --> 14:05.606
You... you can't tell him that,

14:05.608 --> 14:07.044
not on his big night.

14:07.050 --> 14:08.876
You're right, you're
right, you're right.

14:08.878 --> 14:10.411
Maybe it'll all work out.

14:10.413 --> 14:12.146
Yeah, absolutely. Right.

14:12.148 --> 14:13.347
Yeah.

14:13.349 --> 14:15.716
This is not gonna work out, James.

14:15.718 --> 14:17.184
Let's head over to that gallery

14:17.186 --> 14:19.453
and see if we can get
her to come over here.

14:19.455 --> 14:22.690
All right. Show these
Blazer Boys how it's done.

14:25.328 --> 14:28.362
It's catching on.

14:28.364 --> 14:31.799
That, right there, that's
why we'll never be a couple.

14:33.235 --> 14:34.935
Look, uh, Franco is really talented,

14:34.937 --> 14:37.037
and it would really mean a lot to him

14:37.039 --> 14:38.238
if you'd stop by.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.792
I'm sorry, I'm just too busy.

14:39.862 --> 14:41.775
Yeah, you know, he just needs a break.

14:41.777 --> 14:43.744
Wouldn't it be great
if you could be the one

14:43.746 --> 14:48.649
to lift him out of
obscurity? The one, to, uh...

14:50.219 --> 14:51.452
What's going on here?

14:51.454 --> 14:53.220
Oh, yes.

14:53.222 --> 14:57.157
It's called <i> Two Pigs, One Badge.</i>

14:57.159 --> 15:01.128
You know, the police have been
getting a really bad rap lately,

15:01.130 --> 15:03.897
and stuff like this
is not helping things.

15:03.899 --> 15:06.467
Yes, but art is meant to
provoke a conversation,

15:06.469 --> 15:11.305
and I think this is a
conversation well worth having.

15:11.307 --> 15:12.272
Mm-hmm.

15:12.274 --> 15:14.068
Well, you are having a conversation

15:14.146 --> 15:16.286
with a cop.

15:16.365 --> 15:18.178
Are you threatening me?

15:18.180 --> 15:19.380
Uh, hey, Randy,

15:19.382 --> 15:22.449
did you check out this giant Jenga?

15:22.451 --> 15:25.686
You snooty jackasses are all alike.

15:25.688 --> 15:28.889
You scoff at law enforcement
until the day you need it.

15:28.891 --> 15:31.291
Okay, I am filming
this. I'm filming this!

15:31.293 --> 15:35.596
And I am filming you,
for being anti-cop.

15:35.598 --> 15:37.765
Okay, now, everybody just stay cool.

15:37.767 --> 15:41.135
Nobody do anything
stupid. Randy, you go now.

15:41.137 --> 15:42.569
Just move quietly. No, no.

15:42.571 --> 15:45.506
Back it up, back it up. You
got that door open? All right.

15:49.211 --> 15:50.310
How'd it go?

15:50.312 --> 15:54.214
Search YouTube for
"Psycho Cop at Art Show."

15:55.866 --> 15:56.999
REGGIE: Hey, hey.

15:57.048 --> 15:58.714
I found one I like.

15:58.763 --> 15:59.862
Really?

16:00.122 --> 16:01.889
Yeah. That's nice.

16:01.891 --> 16:04.858
You know, it's bright,
it's colorful. I love it.

16:04.860 --> 16:08.328
Dad, it's a neon sign that
tells you where the coffee is.

16:08.330 --> 16:10.731
Yeah, I know. How much?

16:10.733 --> 16:14.068
Why'd you even come if
you gonna be like this?

16:14.070 --> 16:17.905
I came here to talk some
sense into your black ass.

16:17.907 --> 16:19.807
To keep you from messing up your life.

16:19.809 --> 16:21.742
God, I wish you'd never
even seen that flyer.

16:21.744 --> 16:23.677
(scoffs) Well, it was
hard for me not to.

16:23.679 --> 16:25.512
Somebody slid it under my damn door.

16:25.514 --> 16:29.191
Maya! She was in charge of the flyers.

16:29.348 --> 16:31.752
It wasn't Maya. It was me.

16:31.754 --> 16:33.808
What?

16:33.848 --> 16:36.490
I'm the one that slipped
that flyer under his door.

16:36.492 --> 16:38.759
How did you get into my building?

16:41.430 --> 16:44.131
You lucky your ass didn't get shot.

16:45.334 --> 16:47.101
Arthur, look, you got to stop
meddling with my life, man.

16:47.103 --> 16:48.135
This thing with my dad,

16:48.137 --> 16:50.437
getting me to do this
stupid-ass art show.

16:50.439 --> 16:51.872
Hold on.

16:51.874 --> 16:54.341
You're the one that's putting
these crazy ideas in his head

16:54.343 --> 16:55.676
about being an artist?

16:55.678 --> 16:57.584
Hey, look, it's not crazy.

16:57.665 --> 16:59.498
You deserve a break.

16:59.648 --> 17:01.595
Because you're really talented.

17:01.626 --> 17:04.318
Listen, the world is
filled with talented people

17:04.319 --> 17:05.685
who can't feed themselves.

17:05.688 --> 17:07.954
I'm trying to get my
boy to be realistic.

17:07.957 --> 17:09.623
Yeah, well, maybe he doesn't need that.

17:09.625 --> 17:10.924
How would you know what he needs?

17:10.925 --> 17:12.559
You're not his father.

17:14.230 --> 17:17.097
Hey, you know something, Arthur?

17:17.098 --> 17:19.031
He's right.

17:19.034 --> 17:21.201
- You ain't my father.
- Huh.

17:21.203 --> 17:25.906
Because unlike my father,
you actually believe in me.

17:25.907 --> 17:28.208
You actually accept who I am.

17:28.210 --> 17:30.310
Uh, hold on, I'm confused.

17:30.312 --> 17:32.546
Um...

17:32.548 --> 17:34.515
Who the hell you mad at?

17:34.517 --> 17:37.851
I'm mad at both of you!

17:37.853 --> 17:39.353
But at least he supports me.

17:39.355 --> 17:41.321
Dad, look, w-whether
you like it or not, man,

17:41.323 --> 17:43.757
I'm-I'm gonna be an artist. Yeah.

17:43.759 --> 17:46.094
So, I'm sick of your voice in my head,

17:46.149 --> 17:49.196
and from now on, I'm
only gonna listen to mine.

17:49.198 --> 17:50.631
Oh.

17:50.633 --> 17:52.833
O-Oh.

17:52.835 --> 17:55.002
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

17:55.004 --> 17:56.737
Okay.

17:56.739 --> 17:59.840
Well, I guess you just gonna
have to learn the hard way.

17:59.842 --> 18:01.375
See you around, son.

18:01.377 --> 18:02.776
Mm-hmm.

18:10.619 --> 18:14.254
Wow, you just faced
your harshest critic.

18:14.256 --> 18:15.956
You're officially an artist.

18:15.958 --> 18:18.058
And no one can tell you any different.

18:18.060 --> 18:20.194
Look who it is.

18:21.030 --> 18:23.230
Except her.

18:23.232 --> 18:27.100
Oh, look, it's all the
maniacs from before.

18:32.101 --> 18:34.223
Maya, how'd you get her to come?

18:34.610 --> 18:36.910
I spent a lot of time in
art galleries growing up,

18:36.912 --> 18:38.378
so I threw around some art lingo,

18:38.380 --> 18:39.947
told her how great Franco was,

18:39.949 --> 18:42.816
agreed to go on a date
with her and here we are.

18:45.688 --> 18:48.088
Just back up a step.

18:48.090 --> 18:49.623
Oh, that.

18:49.625 --> 18:52.793
I'm in grad school, I
should try some stuff.

18:55.698 --> 18:59.099
Interesting work.
Somebody has daddy issues.

18:59.101 --> 19:00.834
Oh, boy, she's good.

19:00.836 --> 19:05.038
But, you clearly have raw talent.

19:05.040 --> 19:07.674
I mean, your composition's
all over the map,

19:07.676 --> 19:09.743
but your imagery's very powerful.

19:09.745 --> 19:10.584
Thank you.

19:10.638 --> 19:12.846
So, he's ready for your gallery, huh?

19:12.848 --> 19:14.548
Oh, God, no.

19:14.550 --> 19:16.416
No, you need to refine your technique,

19:16.418 --> 19:17.985
focus yourself stylistically.

19:17.987 --> 19:19.853
You definitely need to go to art school.

19:19.855 --> 19:21.688
Even then, the odds of
you ever making a living

19:21.690 --> 19:24.157
are, like, one in a thousand.

19:24.159 --> 19:28.662
You've got a long, long
path in front of you.

19:30.266 --> 19:32.699
Wear your hair up Saturday night.

19:38.540 --> 19:40.207
ARTHUR: Hey, Franco.

19:40.209 --> 19:41.441
Yeah?

19:41.443 --> 19:42.909
You all right?

19:42.911 --> 19:45.012
I mean, did you hear her?

19:46.782 --> 19:48.415
I got a path! (laughs)

19:48.417 --> 19:49.916
(laughs): Hey!

19:49.918 --> 19:51.118
That's so great!

19:51.120 --> 19:53.299
- JAMES: That's what I'm talking about!
- Yeah!

19:57.940 --> 19:58.456
ARTHUR: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:58.496 --> 20:00.762
Be careful putting those
back up, they're important.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.600
What, they're just pictures of donuts.

20:02.612 --> 20:04.111
It's a subliminal message.

20:04.113 --> 20:06.413
People will see them and
they'll want to buy donuts.

20:06.415 --> 20:09.416
But that's all you sell.

20:09.418 --> 20:12.219
Why else would people come in?

20:12.221 --> 20:15.956
Must be nice to be young
and know everything.

20:18.861 --> 20:20.794
Franco,

20:20.796 --> 20:22.096
I would like to buy that one.

20:22.098 --> 20:25.232
Really? All right,
I'll-I'll box it up, then.

20:25.234 --> 20:27.901
You don't seem like
the art collector type.

20:27.903 --> 20:29.270
Don't be so surprised.

20:29.272 --> 20:31.272
He's a talented up-and-coming artist.

20:31.274 --> 20:33.374
That could be worth something someday.

20:33.376 --> 20:35.042
And, the value goes up

20:35.044 --> 20:36.277
if the artist dies young,

20:36.279 --> 20:38.479
and with Franco being black
and living in Chicago...

20:38.481 --> 20:40.347
Fawz.

20:41.317 --> 20:43.984
God forbid something
should happen to him.

20:43.986 --> 20:47.554
(coughing)

20:47.556 --> 20:49.723
I'll take that one, too.
