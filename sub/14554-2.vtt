WEBVTT

00:05.706 --> 00:07.975
Knock, knock.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.677
Who's there?

00:09.743 --> 00:13.147
Lilly, knock, knock.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.216
Knock, knock.

00:15.283 --> 00:17.151
Lilly, knock, knock!

00:17.218 --> 00:20.321
Could you answer the door,
please?
I don't want to.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.890
Well, then you have to
say "not home."

00:22.956 --> 00:25.459
Knock, knock.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.761
Not home.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.363
Daddy, knock, knock.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.232
No, no, no.

00:31.299 --> 00:33.101
You didn't want me a minute ago,
so I don't think so.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.303
Please, Daddy, please.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.805
Now Lilly won't now.
Please.

00:37.871 --> 00:38.906
Daddy.

00:38.972 --> 00:40.441
Please?

00:40.508 --> 00:43.043
Knock, knock.

00:43.111 --> 00:44.578
Who's there?

00:44.645 --> 00:46.046
Moo.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.781
Moo who?

00:47.848 --> 00:49.750
I didn't know
you were crying.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.519
Cow.

00:56.890 --> 00:57.958
That's ridiculous.

00:58.025 --> 01:00.194
I have one.
Okay.

01:00.261 --> 01:01.129
Knock, knock.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.730
Who's there?

01:02.796 --> 01:04.598
Who.
Who who?

01:04.665 --> 01:05.599
Hi, owl.

01:07.801 --> 01:09.670
Knock, knock.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.105
Who's there?

01:11.172 --> 01:13.006
Painter.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.208
Painter who?
Painter who?

01:14.275 --> 01:16.477
The painter who painted
both of you as mermaids,

01:16.544 --> 01:18.479
but instead of
being underwater,

01:18.546 --> 01:20.181
it's pee-pee.

01:22.816 --> 01:24.952
What does that
even mean?

01:25.018 --> 01:26.086
I don't--
I don't know, man.

01:26.154 --> 01:27.855
Daddy, you tell one.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.391
Okay.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.560
Knock, knock.
Who's there?

01:38.732 --> 01:40.000
I don't get it.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.202
Okay, Daddy.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.003
Knock, knock.
Who's there?

01:43.070 --> 01:45.273
Chicken.
Chicken who?

01:48.176 --> 01:49.610
I just don't get it.

01:49.677 --> 01:52.246
If you don't get it,
you just don't get it.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.114
But that's not fair.
That's okay, baby.

01:54.182 --> 01:56.950
Tell another one.

01:57.017 --> 01:59.220
I want to tell a joke.

01:59.287 --> 02:01.389
Not a knock-knock one.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.657
Like a riddle.
Okay, go ahead.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.493
I have kids,
and after you have kids,

02:05.559 --> 02:07.261
you reserve your wishes
for your kids.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.696
My kids, I love my kids.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.698
My daughter told me a joke
the other day,

02:10.764 --> 02:13.801
and she tells great jokes.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.969
They're not-- They're not like
anybody else's jokes,

02:16.036 --> 02:17.271
that's why I like them.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.039
I've been doing comedy
for 25 years.

02:19.106 --> 02:20.107
I know every joke.

02:20.174 --> 02:21.709
Even if I haven't heard it.

02:21.775 --> 02:24.512
You start telling me a joke,
I know how it's gonna work.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.814
But her jokes, I have no idea
what's gonna happen.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.682
I have no idea.

02:28.749 --> 02:31.985
This is the joke she told me
the other day, she said,

02:32.052 --> 02:34.788
"Who didn't let the gorilla...

02:38.792 --> 02:40.661
... into the ballet?"

02:40.728 --> 02:43.764
Who didn't let the gorilla
into the ballet?

02:43.831 --> 02:45.699
Already, I love this joke.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.468
I love this joke.

02:47.535 --> 02:50.103
I have not heard this joke.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.105
This is a new joke
for me,

02:52.172 --> 02:54.708
who didn't let
the gorilla into the ballet?

02:54.775 --> 02:56.244
And I said, "Who?"

02:56.310 --> 02:57.678
And she said, "Just the people
who are in charge

02:57.745 --> 02:59.413
of that decision."

03:02.883 --> 03:06.086
Just the folks
who make that assessment.

03:06.153 --> 03:09.523
They-- Their judgment
was that it was--

03:09.590 --> 03:11.559
wasn't a good idea
to let 'em in.

03:11.625 --> 03:15.729
I love this joke
because I picture it.

03:15.796 --> 03:18.599
I-- A whole story's
in my head of

03:18.666 --> 03:20.834
people going
into a ballet theater

03:20.901 --> 03:24.137
and the gorilla's just trying to
text and not make eye contact,

03:24.204 --> 03:26.274
just kinda--

03:26.340 --> 03:28.609
Just trying to go in,
it's cool.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.143
And somebody's--
"Hey, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.179
No, no, no, no--
you, no, no."

03:32.246 --> 03:33.080
"What?"

03:33.146 --> 03:34.648
"Yeah, you."

03:34.715 --> 03:37.951
"Yes, the gorilla,
I'm talking to the gorilla."

03:38.018 --> 03:39.052
"Why not, man?"

03:39.119 --> 03:40.321
"'Cause you're a gorilla,

03:40.388 --> 03:43.357
I don't even have to
say anything."

03:43.424 --> 03:45.493
"Don't I get
any credit for talking

03:45.559 --> 03:48.329
"and wanting to go to
a ballet?

03:48.396 --> 03:50.364
Doesn't that
buy me any credibility?"

03:50.431 --> 03:53.601
"No, man, it's a long show.
It's three hours.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.269
"You're not gonna-- I'm telling
you, you're not gonna make it.

03:55.336 --> 03:58.138
"You're okay now,
but halfway through,

03:58.205 --> 04:00.341
"you're gonna start pounding
on people.

04:00.408 --> 04:03.344
"That's just the way
you guys are, man, I ain't--

04:03.411 --> 04:05.446
I ain't gonna get burned
like that again."

04:08.449 --> 04:10.951
A gorilla kills everybody
at the ballet once,

04:11.018 --> 04:13.321
shame on the gorilla.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.461
When you have children--

04:20.528 --> 04:21.662
Like, I was talking to my
daughter the other day,

04:21.729 --> 04:23.431
and I was talking
to her like this.

04:23.497 --> 04:26.467
I was bent over and I was
talking like this.

04:26.534 --> 04:27.935
I have no idea
what I was talking about.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.670
I think I even forgot while
I was saying it.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.740
I just was upset and I was
talking to her like this.

04:32.806 --> 04:35.576
And she's looking up at me with
this face, like, coping,

04:35.643 --> 04:37.645
like looking at me like--

04:37.711 --> 04:41.549
And I realized,
I'm her first asshole.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.916
Like, I'm the first one.

04:56.330 --> 05:00.801
* Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie *

05:00.868 --> 05:05.673
* Louie, Louie, Louie
Louaaa *

05:05.739 --> 05:10.344
* Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie *

05:10.411 --> 05:15.115
* Louie, Louie
you're gonna cry *

05:15.182 --> 05:19.687
* Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie *

05:19.753 --> 05:24.392
* Louie, Louie, Louie
Louaaa *

05:24.458 --> 05:28.929
* Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie *

05:28.996 --> 05:33.233
* Louie, Louie
you're gonna die *

05:33.300 --> 05:37.170
* Louie, Louie, Louie
Louie... **

05:37.237 --> 05:39.272
My wife and I are
very blessed.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.542
We have no children.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.076
We're not gonna have children.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.178
Refugee kids-- too bad,
I'll write you a check,

05:45.245 --> 05:47.047
but you're not
coming to my house.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.182
No kids.

05:49.249 --> 05:50.551
And people are very cruel

05:50.618 --> 05:52.420
when they meet couples
without children.

05:52.486 --> 05:53.821
They go, "Oh,
you don't have children?

05:53.887 --> 05:55.489
What happened?"

05:55.556 --> 05:56.857
What happened-- I pulled out,
I shot on the sheets,

05:56.924 --> 05:58.926
that's what happened.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.227
Married, buddy?

06:00.293 --> 06:01.595
( man )
Nope.
Nope! That's good.

06:01.662 --> 06:04.297
See that? Energy.
How old are you?

06:04.364 --> 06:05.633
24.

06:05.699 --> 06:09.269
That guy has a young,
nervous penis.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.371
No, when you're
24 and single,

06:11.439 --> 06:12.840
your penis is like
the nervous guy

06:12.906 --> 06:14.742
in the World War II movies
in the foxhole.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.309
Any sound your penis hears--

06:16.376 --> 06:17.811
What was that?

06:17.878 --> 06:21.081
Let's go, let's go,
let's move!

06:21.148 --> 06:23.316
I'm married in my 50s.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.853
My penis is relaxed.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.055
My penis is sitting in a chair,
smoking a pipe,

06:28.121 --> 06:30.424
reading the paper.

06:30.491 --> 06:33.226
My penis is like
Bing Crosby.

06:33.293 --> 06:35.563
Yes, I heard a noise.

06:35.629 --> 06:39.099
Could be a hand,
could be a vagina.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.702
Buh-buh, buh-buh-buh.

06:41.769 --> 06:45.005
You've been very nice,
thank you very much!

06:45.072 --> 06:46.940
Thank you!

06:47.007 --> 06:51.745
Allan Havey!

06:53.113 --> 06:54.915
Allan Havey in the house.

07:01.555 --> 07:04.357
Did you hear about
Dominic Peretti?

07:04.424 --> 07:06.694
Who?

07:06.760 --> 07:10.097
That comic
from Connecticut.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.532
The guitar guy?

07:11.599 --> 07:13.501
With the guitar?
No.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.168
The guy that did
the arms thing?

07:15.235 --> 07:17.571
Gets a chick onstage,
put her arms through his.

07:17.638 --> 07:20.240
Oh, a million guys
do that bit.

07:20.307 --> 07:23.210
You don't remember
Dominic Peretti?

07:23.276 --> 07:26.013
Did he have
an Asian wife?

07:26.079 --> 07:28.448
I don't know.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.651
Anyway, he died.

07:30.718 --> 07:33.587
Really?
Yeah.

07:33.654 --> 07:36.557
That's too bad.

07:36.624 --> 07:39.860
Hey, you want to come over
next week for dinner?

07:39.927 --> 07:42.195
To your house?

07:42.262 --> 07:44.632
Yeah, Debbie'll
cook something.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.667
I don't think your wife
likes me, man.

07:46.734 --> 07:48.368
No, she likes you.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.303
I don't think so.

07:50.370 --> 07:51.572
It was her idea.

07:51.639 --> 07:52.973
She wanted me to ask you.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.675
She did?

07:54.742 --> 07:56.710
She said to
invite you over.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.713
So come over,
have dinner.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.426
Thank you very much.

08:46.493 --> 08:47.995
Thank you very much.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.192
( knocking )

09:54.594 --> 09:55.896
Hey.

09:55.963 --> 09:56.930
Hi.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.331
( Allan )
How you doing, son?

09:58.398 --> 09:59.867
What's going on,
how are you?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.935
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, Debbie,
thanks for having me.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.303
Oh, totally.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.705
Lori.

10:04.772 --> 10:05.939
Hi, Debbie.
Hey.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.141
Lori, how you doing?
Come on in.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.546
Louie, this is Lori.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.282
Lori, this is Louie.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.117
Hi, nice to meet you.
Hi.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.852
Weird.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.120
Why?

10:20.187 --> 10:22.122
We were just both
at the liquor store.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.290
Oh.

10:23.356 --> 10:26.193
Well, let me
get you a drink.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.394
I'll come with.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.336
Sorry.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.271
Allan.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.807
She wanted to set you up.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.274
I knew you wouldn't come.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.744
No, I wouldn't have, man.

10:43.811 --> 10:46.479
Look, just so you know,
this Lori,

10:46.546 --> 10:47.547
she didn't know, either.

10:47.614 --> 10:48.782
This is stupid, though.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.517
This kind of shit
never works.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.986
It's a good dinner,
we'll eat.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.487
You don't have to talk to her
if you don't want to.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.056
We'll go out to a bar.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.958
We'll leave them,
I don't care.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.760
Hey, where's the vodka?

10:59.827 --> 11:01.461
You drank it.
Oh yeah.

11:01.528 --> 11:03.296
I got you here.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.766
That's all I promised her.

11:19.780 --> 11:24.551
So Louie's a comedian
just like Allan.

11:24.617 --> 11:26.386
Yeah?

11:28.488 --> 11:30.190
Yes, I'm a comedian.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.962
Louie.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.230
Why don't you ask Lori
what she does?

11:40.333 --> 11:43.103
What do you do, Lori?

11:43.170 --> 11:45.705
I have a landscaping
company.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.040
I own six trucks.

11:47.107 --> 11:50.110
We cover Northern Jersey
and Nyack.

11:50.177 --> 11:53.680
In the summer, I got
two clam shacks in Sag Harbor.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.115
Wow.

11:55.182 --> 11:57.417
So you like own
your own business?

11:57.484 --> 11:58.786
Yeah.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.788
That's what I just
told you.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.189
( Debbie )
Lori.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.771
( Debbie )
Why did you say not a word
during dinner?

12:17.838 --> 12:19.206
( Allan )
Oh, you want me
to talk now?

12:19.272 --> 12:20.841
Yeah, I do want you
to talk now.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.542
That's bullshit.
No, it's not bullshit.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.511
I was in there
all by myself.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.746
No you weren't,
I was there.
Oh yeah, what did you say?

12:26.814 --> 12:29.549
I'm going out for a smoke.
You want to join me?

12:29.616 --> 12:33.186
Oh, I don't smoke anymore,
but I'll keep you company.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.455
Whatever.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.495
Married people.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.664
They just want to spread
their shit on everybody.

12:44.731 --> 12:47.400
I know.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.736
I don't want a husband.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.505
Last thing I need's
another mouth to feed.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.177
Want to get out of here?

12:57.244 --> 12:58.578
Get a drink?

12:58.645 --> 13:01.214
Yeah.
Yes.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.283
Come on, I'll drive you.
Okay.

13:16.864 --> 13:18.565
Oh yeah.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.534
And you don't
even menstruate.

13:21.601 --> 13:22.870
How do you know?

13:22.936 --> 13:24.371
Well, I just--
Sorry to assume.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.339
You haven't met every guy.
Sorry to assume.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.008
No, but it is.

13:28.075 --> 13:30.077
Like, you don't believe
anything good ever happens.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.444
Yep.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.679
Yep.

13:32.745 --> 13:33.881
And then what makes you--

13:33.947 --> 13:35.715
You know,
and then what happens?

13:35.782 --> 13:36.884
It's not that something
good happens.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.285
It's just that--

13:38.351 --> 13:39.920
No, something good happens
and you feel better

13:39.987 --> 13:41.588
and you forget
that you feel better

13:41.654 --> 13:42.990
'cause it was something--

13:43.056 --> 13:44.591
When does that--
When does that happen?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.659
Mostly, it's really shitty.

13:46.726 --> 13:49.429
I think-- Isn't it like, 90%
of the time, isn't it shitty?

13:49.496 --> 13:50.263
Pretty much.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.705
Why are you so much fun?

13:58.771 --> 14:00.740
Will you marry me?
No!

14:00.807 --> 14:02.342
Woo-hoo!

14:09.016 --> 14:10.617
You're a pisser.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.620
You're a pisser, too.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.957
You are seriously
a pisser.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.426
Whoopsie-daisy.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.194
And a dribbler.

14:24.932 --> 14:27.034
This is the most fun
I've had in a long time.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.069
I know, me too.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.405
The best part about it is

14:32.472 --> 14:35.208
I never have to see
your ( blank ) face again.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.476
I know!

14:43.550 --> 14:45.685
What are you--

14:45.752 --> 14:47.720
Hey, what are you doing?

14:47.787 --> 14:49.622
I'm gonna put out.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.691
Let me blow you.

14:51.758 --> 14:53.326
Seriously?

14:53.393 --> 14:55.262
No, it's a hidden-
camera show.

14:55.328 --> 14:58.431
Come on,
get that thing out.

14:58.498 --> 14:59.967
Okay.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.237
All right.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.647
Good?

15:14.714 --> 15:16.583
Yeah, that was--

15:16.649 --> 15:17.884
That was very good.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.786
Nice.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.621
Okay.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.625
Let's get some payback.

15:25.692 --> 15:26.960
What?

15:27.027 --> 15:29.229
Strap on the feedbag.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.897
Oh.

15:30.964 --> 15:33.633
Yeah.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.368
Um...

15:35.435 --> 15:37.870
Well, I don't really
want to do that.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.340
What?
I don't--

15:40.407 --> 15:42.675
I just don't want to--
I don't want to do it.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.281
Jesus.

15:48.348 --> 15:49.949
Don't tell me you're
one of those guys

15:50.017 --> 15:51.551
that doesn't eat pussy.

15:51.618 --> 15:52.785
No, I do.

15:52.852 --> 15:53.987
I do, I just--

15:54.054 --> 15:55.722
Just not with me?

15:55.788 --> 15:58.158
Yeah, no, not now.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.160
What do you mean
not now?

16:00.227 --> 16:01.961
Well, that's very--
That's very intimate.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.030
I don't really know you.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.364
Intimate?

16:04.431 --> 16:06.766
Me sucking your dick's
not intimate?

16:06.833 --> 16:08.701
Well, no,
apparently not.

16:08.768 --> 16:11.238
I mean, it didn't--
It doesn't seem like
a big deal for you,

16:11.304 --> 16:14.941
but for me, it would be,
to do that, to you.

16:15.008 --> 16:17.010
You gotta be shitting me.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.978
I did you, you're not
doing me, that's not fair.

16:19.046 --> 16:20.313
Well, no, it's just--

16:20.380 --> 16:21.848
We just have different
values about that.

16:21.914 --> 16:23.283
This isn't about values.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.652
I just sucked your dick,
you can eat my pussy.

16:25.718 --> 16:29.056
I'm not gonna do it,
I'm sorry, it's just too soon.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.859
Are you saying
I'm a whore?

16:32.925 --> 16:33.993
No!

16:34.061 --> 16:35.762
Not by how you feel.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.297
That's what you did,
I just--

16:37.364 --> 16:40.900
I'm just saying that if
I had done what you did, I--

16:40.967 --> 16:43.203
I would feel like a whore.

16:43.270 --> 16:44.871
You shouldn't have
said that.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.373
Listen.

16:46.439 --> 16:47.340
Would you really want me
to do that to you

16:47.407 --> 16:48.941
if I didn't
want to do it?

16:49.008 --> 16:52.179
I don't give a shit,
I just want to get off.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.114
You know how many dicks
I sucked

16:54.181 --> 16:56.816
I didn't want to suck,
'cause I'm a good kid?

16:56.883 --> 16:58.218
'Cause I do what's right?

16:58.285 --> 16:59.886
I never left
anyone hanging.

16:59.952 --> 17:02.089
How dare you.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.690
Listen, if this is--

17:03.756 --> 17:06.559
If-- if you blowing me hinged
on my doing that to you,

17:06.626 --> 17:08.595
then you just should
have said something first.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.130
Your sperms are dying

17:10.197 --> 17:14.201
inside my mouth
right now, goddammit.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.403
Louie the gentleman.

17:16.469 --> 17:20.006
What is wrong
with this country?

17:20.073 --> 17:22.342
Just this is--
That's how I feel, it's--

17:22.409 --> 17:23.643
Obama.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.317
I say, this is balls.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.520
I'm gonna say it, this is
freaking balls on you.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.693
I'll tell you what, though.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.662
Wanna make a bet?

17:42.729 --> 17:44.997
What?

17:45.064 --> 17:47.267
I bet you 200 bucks
in about three minutes,

17:47.334 --> 17:49.869
you're gonna be licking
my asshole and my pussy.

17:49.936 --> 17:53.072
What?
I'm serious.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.441
You're gonna be.

17:54.507 --> 17:58.010
You're gonna be licking up
my asshole, my pussy,

17:58.077 --> 17:59.146
all back and forth.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.480
You're gonna be
doing that.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.449
No, I think
you're mistaken.

18:02.515 --> 18:05.152
I don't think it's--
That's not gonna happen.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.787
200 bucks.
Make it 1,000.

18:12.058 --> 18:15.828
You wanna know why
you won't do it?

18:17.897 --> 18:19.832
Why? I told you why.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.368
Oh yeah.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.736
And you're real smart
and make good points.

18:23.803 --> 18:26.539
But I think we both know
what's going on here.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.641
What?

18:28.708 --> 18:30.310
Faggot.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.580
Are you serious?

18:33.646 --> 18:34.914
I'm not gay.

18:34.981 --> 18:36.949
Yeah, you're gay.

18:37.016 --> 18:39.552
That's not gonna work.

18:39.619 --> 18:40.553
That's stupid.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.755
I'm not gay, you know
I'm not gay.

18:42.822 --> 18:45.292
You're gay, mm-hmm.

18:45.358 --> 18:48.060
I think you get girls
to blow you

18:48.127 --> 18:50.797
and you shut your eyes
and think about men.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.932
And then when it's
your turn, lo and behold,

18:52.999 --> 18:54.701
you're disgusted
by the female vagina

18:54.767 --> 18:56.203
because you're gay.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.470
That's not--

18:57.537 --> 18:59.239
That's so stupid,
I'm not gay.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.308
Yeah, you get some tough girl
who chain smokes

19:01.374 --> 19:03.610
to blow you in her truck,

19:03.676 --> 19:05.245
and then you go home
and jerk yourself off

19:05.312 --> 19:06.879
thinking about dick.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.017
Oh, Jesus!

19:11.083 --> 19:12.952
Come on, come on!
Fucking--

19:13.019 --> 19:14.153
Come on!

19:14.221 --> 19:15.488
Lick it, lick it!

19:15.555 --> 19:16.589
Lick it!

19:16.656 --> 19:18.691
Lick it,
I'll break your finger!

19:18.758 --> 19:19.626
Okay, okay.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.769
Oh.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.839
Goddammit,
you are crazy.

19:32.905 --> 19:35.007
You owe me
a thousand bucks.

19:35.074 --> 19:37.277
Well, I don't
have it on me.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.646
That's okay, you can
pay me next time.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.448
You want to
go out again, right?

19:41.514 --> 19:43.616
Yeah, sure.
Okay.

19:54.927 --> 19:57.630
Who told the gorilla

19:57.697 --> 20:00.233
that he couldn't go to
the ballet performance?

20:00.300 --> 20:01.868
What?
What?

20:01.934 --> 20:03.670
Who told the gorilla

20:03.736 --> 20:06.239
that he couldn't go to
the ballet performance?

20:06.306 --> 20:08.541
I don't know, who?

20:08.608 --> 20:10.310
Well...

20:10.377 --> 20:13.079
just whoever
was in charge.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.548
The people in
charge decided

20:15.615 --> 20:18.318
not to put
a gorilla in,

20:18.385 --> 20:19.752
in case there was
problems.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.190
That's really
funny, Jane.

20:24.257 --> 20:26.092
It's a good joke.
Thanks.

20:26.158 --> 20:27.694
Yeah, that's really good.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.562
It's really good.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.265
You guys done eating?

20:32.332 --> 20:33.566
I'm done.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.302
Okay, go do your
homework.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.407
Thank you for making
the nice food, Daddy.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.808
Thank you so much.

20:41.874 --> 20:42.975
Oh, you're welcome.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.744
Oh, no problem.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.613
Yeah, Daddy, it's really nice
how you make food for us

20:46.679 --> 20:49.816
all the time
and clean up afterwards.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.918
Well, jeez, girls.

20:51.984 --> 20:54.321
Your appreciation really makes
it all worth it, you know.
