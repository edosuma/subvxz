<i>Let us praise famous men...</i>

00:44.000 --> 00:46.080
<i>and our fathers that begat us.</i>

00:48.040 --> 00:50.080
<i>All these men...</i>

00:50.160 --> 00:52.400
<i>were honoured in their generations...</i>

00:52.480 --> 00:56.400
<i>and were a glory in their days.</i>

00:56.480 --> 01:00.440
We are here today to give thanks...

01:00.560 --> 01:03.880
for the life of Harold Abrahams.

01:05.519 --> 01:08.480
To honour the legend.

01:09.560 --> 01:12.120
Now there are just two of us...

01:12.200 --> 01:14.720
young Aubrey Montague...

01:14.800 --> 01:17.040
and myself...

01:17.120 --> 01:19.640
who can close our eyes...

01:19.720 --> 01:23.800
and remember those few young men...

01:23.880 --> 01:26.400
with hope in our hearts...

01:26.480 --> 01:30.080
<i>and wings on our heels.</i>

04:07.220 --> 04:10.340
<i>Carlton Hotel, Broadstairs, Kent.</i>

04:10.420 --> 04:12.500
<i>28th June, 1924.</i>

04:12.700 --> 04:17.300
<i>Dear Mum. I'm most awfully sorry about</i>
<i>your cold and the general dreariness.</i>

04:17.380 --> 04:19.940
<i>We're also having</i>
<i>quite bad weather here, too.</i>

04:20.060 --> 04:23.540
<i>Thanks for your letters.</i>
<i>I'm sorry you and Pa are disappointed...</i>

04:23.620 --> 04:27.460
<i>I should be letting the Olympic Games</i>
<i>interfere with my shorthand.</i>

04:27.540 --> 04:31.940
<i>But if you were my age, with a chance</i>
<i>to win the World Championship in Paris...</i>

04:32.020 --> 04:34.380
<i>you would be just as big a fool as I am.</i>

04:34.460 --> 04:39.020
<i>By the way, it's awfully kind of Pa</i>
<i>to finance me here, in spite of my idiocy.</i>

04:39.100 --> 04:43.260
<i>It's marvellous for esprit de corps.</i>
<i>Most of the chaps have managed to get down.</i>

04:43.340 --> 04:46.340
- Cricket, Montague, in the ballroom.
- Now!

04:47.860 --> 04:49.780
No ball!

04:49.860 --> 04:51.940
Come on, Aubrey, the old leg break.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.980
- Howzat!
- Not out.

05:06.060 --> 05:08.580
What? You could hear it
in bloody Bournemouth!

05:08.660 --> 05:11.340
- Come on, Liddell, my innings.
- I didn't touch it.

05:11.420 --> 05:15.140
- You heard the crack of my wrist.
- I saw the bloody thing bend!
- Andy!

05:15.220 --> 05:17.220
No tickle for me.

05:17.300 --> 05:20.380
He's out, I tell you.
You're all deaf and bloody blind.

05:20.460 --> 05:23.180
Aubrey, I ask you, for God's sake!

05:27.220 --> 05:29.300
It's not fair!

05:34.820 --> 05:36.700
All right.

05:40.020 --> 05:42.540
<i>Harold's here. As intense as ever.</i>

05:42.620 --> 05:45.700
<i>Just as he was</i>
<i>on our very first day at Cambridge.</i>

05:45.780 --> 05:47.860
<i>I remember we shared a taxi together.</i>

06:14.980 --> 06:17.060
I'll take these.

06:20.900 --> 06:23.060
- See you inside, Aubrey.
- Right.

06:24.980 --> 06:27.220
Thank you.

06:31.700 --> 06:33.780
- Name, please.
- We're new.

06:33.860 --> 06:36.060
I can see that, laddie. What's your name?

06:36.140 --> 06:38.220
Abrahams. HM.

06:38.860 --> 06:42.540
- Top of the list. Repton. That the one?
- That's it. Left a year ago.

06:42.620 --> 06:46.260
- Been doing your bit, 'ave you? France?
- No. Joined too late.

06:46.340 --> 06:47.980
Bad luck, lad.

06:48.100 --> 06:50.660
Many a dead man
would have liked a share of it.

06:50.740 --> 06:52.820
You're right there, son.

06:53.700 --> 06:56.060
Welcome to Caius.

06:56.980 --> 07:00.620
- Sign here.
- Thank you.

07:00.700 --> 07:04.780
It's across the courtyard,
top right-hand corner, up the stairs.

07:04.860 --> 07:06.300
Thanks.

07:06.380 --> 07:08.020
By the way, what are your names?

07:08.100 --> 07:11.540
Rogers, head porter,
and this is Mr Ratcliffe, my assistant.

07:11.660 --> 07:13.740
Well, Mr Rogers, Ratcliffe...

07:13.820 --> 07:17.180
I ceased to be a "laddie" when
I took up the King's commission.

07:17.260 --> 07:20.580
- Is that clear?
- Yes... Mr Abrahams.

07:20.660 --> 07:22.660
- Quite clear.
- Thank you.

07:22.740 --> 07:25.220
I'd be obliged if you'd remember it.

07:25.340 --> 07:27.420
- See you later.
- Fine.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.820
What's your friend studying, then, son?

07:31.900 --> 07:33.980
Barrack-room law?

07:34.540 --> 07:36.620
I've no idea.

07:36.700 --> 07:38.420
One thing's certain.

07:38.500 --> 07:43.260
A name like Abrahams, he won't be
in the chapel choir, now, will he?

07:43.340 --> 07:45.540
- Name?
- Montague.

07:45.620 --> 07:47.700
- What?
- Montague.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.980
I take the war list...

08:39.059 --> 08:41.140
and I run down it.

08:42.580 --> 08:45.220
Name after name which I cannot read...

08:45.300 --> 08:48.700
and which we, who are older than you...

08:48.780 --> 08:51.460
cannot hear, without emotion.

08:53.020 --> 08:55.980
Names which will be only names to you...

08:56.060 --> 08:58.140
the new college.

08:58.220 --> 09:03.100
But which to us summon up face after face...

09:04.500 --> 09:08.460
full of honesty and goodness...

09:08.540 --> 09:10.420
zeal and vigour...

09:10.500 --> 09:13.300
and intellectual promise.

09:14.860 --> 09:17.100
The flower of a generation.

09:17.180 --> 09:19.220
The glory of England...

09:19.300 --> 09:21.380
and they died for England...

09:21.460 --> 09:23.780
and all that England stands for.

09:24.940 --> 09:29.260
And now by tragic necessity,
their dreams have become yours.

09:30.060 --> 09:33.260
Let me exhort you. Examine yourselves.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.420
Let each of you discover...

09:35.500 --> 09:38.700
where your true chance of greatness lies.

09:39.420 --> 09:41.500
For their sakes...

09:41.620 --> 09:46.060
for the sake of your college
and your country, seize this chance.

09:46.140 --> 09:48.220
Rejoice in it...

09:48.300 --> 09:52.780
and let no power or persuasion
deter you in your task.

09:56.020 --> 09:58.980
<i>Thursday, October 10th, 1919.</i>

09:59.060 --> 10:01.540
<i>My first day at Cambridge was rounded off...</i>

10:01.620 --> 10:04.460
<i>by the freshmen's dinner,</i>
<i>a sumptuous affair.</i>

10:04.540 --> 10:06.780
<i>The master gave us a moving speech...</i>

10:06.860 --> 10:10.540
<i>and I'm now eagerly awaiting</i>
<i>the start of term proper.</i>

10:10.900 --> 10:13.660
Rugby club, golfing society, tennis...

10:13.740 --> 10:16.740
squash club, flora and fauna, philately.

10:16.820 --> 10:18.940
Is that all? You're an idle man!

10:19.020 --> 10:22.940
- I've got to work some time.
- Try bird-watching. You can take a book.

10:23.020 --> 10:25.100
How can I watch if I'm reading a book?

10:25.180 --> 10:28.060
Follow in the footsteps of WG.
Any Yorkshiremen here?

- Can you manage a tenor?

10:51.260 --> 10:54.620
- We're desperately short of tenors.
- Only under torture.

10:54.700 --> 10:57.620
- Aubrey. Sing, do you?
- School choir, that's all.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.180
You, Stallard?

10:59.260 --> 11:01.700
They kicked me out of <i>Ring-a-ring o'Roses.</i>

Sorry about that. We can't all be gifted.

Where were you

Good middle-distance men
don't grow on trees.

11:39.260 --> 11:41.340
I can't vouch for those times.

11:42.700 --> 11:45.740
Taken with the school alarm clock,
most of them.

11:45.820 --> 11:49.140
Give or take a second,
they're good enough for me.

11:49.940 --> 11:53.300
Have you come across a fellow
called Abrahams? HM Abrahams?

11:53.380 --> 11:55.460
He's challenged for the college dash.

11:55.580 --> 11:57.660
What's so special about that?

11:57.740 --> 12:00.540
In all the 700 years, nobody's ever done it.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.180
Right, what do you do?

12:19.380 --> 12:21.740
Right, chaps, thank you! Thank you.

12:22.900 --> 12:25.980
Let it be known that HM Abrahams
of Gonville and Caius...

12:26.060 --> 12:29.060
has formally made challenge
for the college dash.

12:30.540 --> 12:32.260
You show 'em, Harold!

12:32.340 --> 12:34.700
For those not familiar with the rules...

12:34.780 --> 12:38.500
The challenger will attempt
to run around the court perimeter...

12:38.580 --> 12:40.860
to and from a point beneath the clock...

12:40.940 --> 12:43.980
within the time taken
by the clock to strike midday.

12:44.060 --> 12:47.940
A distance traditionally
recognised as one of 188 paces.

12:48.020 --> 12:51.460
I say, Abrahams, what have you got
on your feet? Rockets?

12:51.540 --> 12:53.940
The challenge will commence on the...

12:54.020 --> 12:57.740
- Abrahams, you haven't got a chance!
- Do it for Israel!

12:57.820 --> 13:00.220
The challenge commences
on the stroke of one.

13:00.300 --> 13:03.300
The challenger must finish
before the stroke of 12.

13:03.380 --> 13:05.460
Come on, Abrahams, you swank!

13:05.580 --> 13:08.020
Will the challenger make himself ready?

13:15.780 --> 13:18.780
This Abrahams.
What do you know about him?

13:18.860 --> 13:20.860
Repton chap.

13:20.940 --> 13:22.260
Jewish.

13:22.340 --> 13:25.700
- His father's a financier in the city.
- Financier?

13:25.780 --> 13:28.340
What's that supposed to mean, I wonder?

13:28.420 --> 13:30.500
I imagine he lends money.

13:31.220 --> 13:33.300
Exactly.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.620
And what do they say about the son?

13:35.700 --> 13:38.660
Academically sound. Arrogant.

13:38.740 --> 13:40.740
Defensive to the point of pugnacity.

13:40.860 --> 13:43.420
Mm. As they invariably are.

13:44.060 --> 13:47.020
Yet possessing
a keen sense of duty and loyalty.

13:50.500 --> 13:53.020
Do they say he can run?

13:53.100 --> 13:54.940
Like the wind.

13:59.020 --> 14:02.660
Gentlemen, would you draw back, please?
Away from the course.

14:02.740 --> 14:04.420
Thank you.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.580
Mr Abrahams, your position, please.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.020
Owing to the absence
of any other challenger...

14:10.140 --> 14:12.020
Mr Abrahams will run alone.

14:12.100 --> 14:14.220
Not so, Mr Starter!

14:17.980 --> 14:20.300
Your name and college, if you please, sir.

14:20.380 --> 14:23.300
Lindsay. I race beside my friend here.

14:23.380 --> 14:27.060
We challenge in the name
of Repton, Eton and Caius.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.780
<i>- I didn't know you ran.</i>
- Nor I you.

14:32.860 --> 14:36.620
Some chap just told me about this.
I thought I'd come and push you along.

14:36.740 --> 14:38.260
- Delighted.
- Splendid.

14:38.340 --> 14:39.460
Good luck.

14:39.540 --> 14:42.460
Gentlemen, to your marks, if you please.

14:44.620 --> 14:47.500
Now remember, on the first strike of 12.

15:12.660 --> 15:14.740
Come on!

15:33.260 --> 15:35.140
<i>Eight!</i>

15:36.300 --> 15:38.380
Nine!

15:39.900 --> 15:41.980
Ten!

15:42.940 --> 15:44.540
- <i>Eleven!</i>
- Go on! Go on!

16:01.140 --> 16:03.020
Did they both do it?

16:03.100 --> 16:05.180
I think not.

16:05.260 --> 16:08.700
- Young Lindsay failed by a whisker.
- Pity.

16:08.780 --> 16:12.900
<i>Well, it's been done.</i>
<i>And by a Caius man! You must be very proud.</i>

16:12.980 --> 16:15.060
<i>The first man in seven centuries.</i>

16:15.140 --> 16:20.340
<i>Perhaps they really are</i>
<i>God's chosen people, after all.</i>

16:22.060 --> 16:24.740
<i>I doubt if there's a swifter man</i>
<i>in the kingdom.</i>

16:27.220 --> 16:29.300
Get to your marks.

16:33.620 --> 16:35.900
Get set.

17:12.940 --> 17:17.140
<i>He may be your best friend, Sandy,</i>
<i>but he's my best brother.</i>

17:17.220 --> 17:20.540
<i>I'm thinking of him</i>
<i>and not your blessed athletics team.</i>

17:20.619 --> 17:23.660
<i>His heart's set on following Father</i>
<i>in the mission.</i>

17:23.740 --> 17:26.859
Do you not think he's busy enough
without taking up racing?

17:26.940 --> 17:30.100
He's fast, Jennie.
You've seen him with a ball in his hands.

17:30.180 --> 17:32.340
I've seen him with a Bible in his hands.

17:32.420 --> 17:34.500
And I know which is the most important.

17:34.580 --> 17:36.660
You can't deny him the chance.

17:36.740 --> 17:39.420
Get him on the track, I'm telling you...

17:39.500 --> 17:42.220
Don't tell me, Sandy. I don't want to hear.

17:42.300 --> 17:44.340
Eric's special to me. Precious.

17:44.420 --> 17:48.180
I don't want his work spoilt
with all this running talk, do you hear?

17:57.020 --> 18:00.140
There you are. Well done.

18:08.180 --> 18:10.340
You know, ladies and gentlemen...

18:10.460 --> 18:14.100
one of the compensations
of achieving a certain notoriety...

18:14.180 --> 18:15.900
if only as a rugby player...

18:15.980 --> 18:19.140
is that occasionally
you're asked to give things away.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.620
It's often said that giving beats receiving.

18:23.700 --> 18:25.620
Let me tell you...

18:25.700 --> 18:28.420
the look of delight
on those little boys' faces...

18:28.500 --> 18:33.020
was worth ten of the tin pots gathering
dust on my Edinburgh sideboard.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.100
When we were in China, my father here...

18:37.180 --> 18:41.140
was always waxing lyrical
about his wee home in the glen.

18:41.980 --> 18:44.420
But being oriental-born myself...

18:44.500 --> 18:47.180
like my brothers and my sister here...

18:47.260 --> 18:49.980
I suffered from a natural incredulity.

18:51.100 --> 18:53.180
But looking about me now...

18:53.260 --> 18:55.340
the heather on the hills...

18:56.660 --> 18:58.980
I can see he was right.

18:59.060 --> 19:01.140
It's very special.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.500
Thank you for welcoming us home.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.100
And thank you...

19:09.180 --> 19:12.620
for reminding me that I am,
and will be whilst I breathe...

19:14.540 --> 19:16.900
a Scot.

19:20.780 --> 19:23.060
Mr Provost, sir.

19:23.140 --> 19:25.980
Before you allow Eric here to go...

19:26.380 --> 19:30.420
Is it not true that the main event
of the meeting is still to be run?

19:30.500 --> 19:32.220
<i>It is. Aye.</i>

19:32.300 --> 19:34.500
The 200-yards open championship.

19:34.580 --> 19:38.140
It's the last event
of this gathering, by tradition.

19:38.220 --> 19:41.540
Do you not think,
if we can find him some kit...

19:41.660 --> 19:45.580
we might persuade Scotland's
finest wing to show us his paces?

19:48.700 --> 19:50.780
What do you say, Eric?

20:01.220 --> 20:03.540
<i>To your marks!</i>

20:03.620 --> 20:04.980
Get set!

21:15.300 --> 21:17.820
Didn't I tell you, Eric? Didn't I tell you?

21:22.900 --> 21:25.900
Surely a touch of liberality
would do no harm.

21:25.980 --> 21:29.500
Sandy, the kingdom of God
is not a democracy.

21:29.580 --> 21:32.140
The Lord never seeks re-election.

21:32.220 --> 21:34.900
There's no discussion, no deliberation...

21:34.980 --> 21:37.540
no referenda as to which road to take.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.580
There's one right, one wrong...

21:40.660 --> 21:42.740
one absolute ruler.

21:42.820 --> 21:47.460
- A dictator, you mean.
- Aye, but a benign, loving dictator.

21:47.540 --> 21:50.180
So much for your freedom of choice.

21:50.260 --> 21:52.420
<i>You've still got a choice, Sandy.</i>

21:53.340 --> 21:55.580
Nobody's forcing you to follow it.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.700
Hey, hey!

22:03.900 --> 22:06.060
- Do you know what day it is?
- Yeah.

22:06.140 --> 22:08.220
- Tell me, then.
- Sunday.

22:08.300 --> 22:10.940
The Sabbath's not a day
for playing football, is it?

22:11.020 --> 22:12.580
No.

22:12.660 --> 22:15.940
- Are you up early in the morning?
- Me ma gets me up at seven.

22:16.020 --> 22:18.100
We'll have a game then, then. OK?

22:18.180 --> 22:20.260
Mr Liddell, is it OK if me da comes?

22:20.340 --> 22:22.580
Sure. Bring your whole family.

22:22.660 --> 22:24.740
I'll give ye a five-goal start.

22:24.820 --> 22:27.180
You've got a train to catch at nine.

22:27.300 --> 22:29.380
There's plenty of time.

22:29.460 --> 22:32.940
Do you want the kid to grow up
thinking God's a spoilsport?

22:36.740 --> 22:39.380
If I may, I'd like to propose a toast.

22:39.460 --> 22:41.180
To the Liddell family...

22:41.260 --> 22:43.820
whom I'm fortunate enough
to call my friends.

22:43.900 --> 22:46.780
The Reverend JD, Mrs L, young Ernest.

22:47.660 --> 22:50.740
<i>Bon voyage and safe journey back to China.</i>

22:50.860 --> 22:53.220
May the years ahead be happy and content.

22:53.300 --> 22:56.700
For those who remain,
may God protect them...

22:56.780 --> 22:58.500
inspire them...

22:58.580 --> 23:00.420
and lead them to glory.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.700
Thank you, Sandy. That was very nice.

23:02.780 --> 23:05.580
I'm relying on you now
to keep them all out of mischief.

23:05.660 --> 23:10.060
That I will, Mrs L. If they do transgress,
I'll pop the details on a postcard.

23:10.140 --> 23:13.220
You can read all about it
before you can say Marco Polo.

23:13.300 --> 23:15.460
Cost you a fortune in postage stamps.

23:15.540 --> 23:17.900
Don't worry. I shall protect my investment.

23:17.980 --> 23:21.060
I'm going to rule you with a rod of iron.

23:22.740 --> 23:25.140
We're going to have to watch ourselves!

23:28.820 --> 23:31.020
You're a very lucky young man, Eric.

23:31.100 --> 23:33.380
You're the proud possessor of many gifts.

23:33.460 --> 23:36.380
And it's your sacred duty
to put them to good use.

23:36.460 --> 23:39.980
Dad's right. Run like we know you can,
strong and true.

23:40.060 --> 23:42.940
The mission cannot but gain
by your success.

23:43.980 --> 23:46.580
What we need now is a muscular Christian.

23:47.100 --> 23:49.980
To make folks sit up and notice.

23:50.060 --> 23:52.500
How good are you, Eric?

23:53.260 --> 23:56.820
Sandy reckons he'll run for Scotland
before the month's out.

23:56.900 --> 23:59.460
Then after that... the sky's the limit.

23:59.540 --> 24:01.020
Meaning what?

24:02.020 --> 24:04.100
The Olympic Games, maybe?

24:05.860 --> 24:09.340
Eric, you can praise the Lord
by peeling a spud...

24:09.420 --> 24:11.500
if you peel it to perfection.

24:11.580 --> 24:14.860
Don't compromise.
Compromise is a language of the devil.

24:14.940 --> 24:16.980
Run in God's name...

24:17.100 --> 24:19.700

25:23.840 --> 25:25.880
You came to see a race today.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.040
To see someone win.

25:28.480 --> 25:30.560
It happened to be me.

25:31.320 --> 25:34.280
But I want you to do more
than just watch a race.

25:35.080 --> 25:37.160
I want you to take part in it.

25:38.280 --> 25:42.040
I want to compare faith to running in a race.

25:43.440 --> 25:45.520
It's hard.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.960
It requires concentration of will.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.600
Energy of soul.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.360
You experience elation...

25:54.440 --> 25:56.520
when the winner breaks the tape...

25:57.480 --> 25:59.840
especially if you've got a bet on it.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.760
But how long does that last?

26:03.360 --> 26:05.920
You go home. Maybe your dinner's burnt.

26:07.040 --> 26:09.480
Maybe you haven't got a job.

26:10.720 --> 26:12.800
So who am I to say believe...

26:13.280 --> 26:16.240
have faith, in the face of life's realities?

26:18.040 --> 26:21.120
I would like to give you
something more permanent...

26:21.200 --> 26:23.280
but I can only point the way.

26:23.840 --> 26:26.360
I have no formula for winning the race.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.880
Everyone runs in her own way...

26:29.000 --> 26:31.080
or his own way.

26:31.160 --> 26:35.120
And where does the power come from
to see the race to its end?

26:37.120 --> 26:39.200
From within.

26:39.960 --> 26:42.040
Jesus said...

26:42.120 --> 26:45.800
"Behold, the kingdom of God is within you."

26:48.160 --> 26:51.840
"If with all your hearts ye truly seek me...

26:51.920 --> 26:54.160
ye shall ever surely find me."

26:54.680 --> 26:56.960
If you commit yourself...

26:57.040 --> 26:59.120
to the love of Christ...

27:00.200 --> 27:03.440
then <i>that is how you run a straight race.</i>

27:10.800 --> 27:13.120
Cheers. Thanks for coming.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.320
It's an ache.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.760
A helplessness.

27:33.600 --> 27:35.720
And an anger.

27:39.680 --> 27:41.760
One feels humiliated.

27:47.520 --> 27:51.720
Sometimes I say to myself,
"Steady on, you're imagining all this."

27:52.520 --> 27:54.600
Then I catch that look again.

27:55.560 --> 27:57.640
Catch it on the edge of a remark.

27:58.480 --> 28:00.960
Feel a cold reluctance in a handshake.

28:07.280 --> 28:09.360
That's my father.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.520
A Lithuanian Jew.

28:12.040 --> 28:14.120
He <i>is alien.</i>

28:14.200 --> 28:17.280
- He's as foreign as a frankfurter.
- A kosher one at that!

28:23.440 --> 28:25.520
I love and admire him.

28:26.880 --> 28:28.960
He worships this country.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.320
From nothing, he built what he believed...

28:31.400 --> 28:34.040
was enough to make
true Englishmen of his sons.

28:35.040 --> 28:37.120
My brother's a doctor.

28:41.640 --> 28:43.720
A leader in his field.

28:44.640 --> 28:48.520
- Which one is he?
- That's me with the curls, on his back.

28:53.240 --> 28:55.320
He wanted for nothing.

28:57.680 --> 28:59.680
And here am I.

<i>Setting up shop</i>

29:19.080 --> 29:21.160

29:21.960 --> 29:24.040
This England of his is Christian...

29:24.120 --> 29:26.200
and Anglo-Saxon.

29:26.760 --> 29:28.920
And so are her corridors of power.

29:30.520 --> 29:34.400
And those who stalk them
guard them with jealousy and venom.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.800
You're right to study law.
You're quite an advocate.

29:38.880 --> 29:42.480
A rare ethnic advantage.
It's called the gift of the gab.

29:49.280 --> 29:51.960
So what now? Grin and bear it?

29:52.040 --> 29:54.040
No, Aubrey.

29:54.120 --> 29:56.880

£25, Liddell to win.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.880
Mr Mussabini, I believe.

33:15.960 --> 33:19.160
My name's Keddie. Colonel John Keddie.

33:19.240 --> 33:21.600
- I'm...
- President of the Scottish Three A's.

33:21.720 --> 33:24.480
I know, and I'm glad to know you, sir.

- <i>Monsieur Sam! Bonjour.</i>
<i>- Bonjour.</i>

33:27.480 --> 33:29.120

- OK.

33:29.200 --> 33:30.880
Nasty fall you took.

<i>Enchanté. Good luck.</i>

You're very welcome here, of course.

But we do have a strict amateur code.

33:39.400 --> 33:41.480
Colonel, don't worry your head.

33:41.560 --> 33:43.480
I'm here spectating, that's all.

33:43.560 --> 33:45.920
Good. I felt sure you would understand.

33:47.040 --> 33:49.160
Well, to battle!

33:49.240 --> 33:51.320
I hope you enjoy the games.

33:52.200 --> 33:54.280
Games? You must be joking.

33:54.360 --> 33:56.840
I've seen better-organised riots.

33:56.920 --> 33:59.880
Come on, Scotland!

<i>Vive la France!</i>

Gentlemen, get to your marks.

34:19.719 --> 34:21.280
Get set.

34:33.080 --> 34:35.159
Get up, lad. Get up.

34:40.159 --> 34:42.320
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:46.400 --> 34:48.360
He'll never do it.

34:48.440 --> 34:50.880
Don't you believe it. His head's not back yet.

35:00.680 --> 35:02.800
Come on, Eric!

35:36.640 --> 35:38.720
Get back! Give him air!

35:41.120 --> 35:43.600
Well done, Eric, son. Well done.

35:43.680 --> 35:46.760
He'll be right in a jiffy.
I'll go away and get his clothes.

35:52.160 --> 35:55.720
You take good care
of this lad o' yours, Mr McGrath.

35:55.800 --> 35:59.840
Because if you drop him,
you'll never find another one like this.

35:59.920 --> 36:03.080
It's not the prettiest quarter
I've ever seen, Mr Liddell.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.240
But certainly the bravest.

36:05.320 --> 36:07.440
Get him up. Come on, gently.

36:12.920 --> 36:15.000
Keep your arm around.

36:36.480 --> 36:38.560
Mr Mussabini.

36:40.680 --> 36:42.800
Mr Abrahams, is it?

36:43.480 --> 36:46.000
So you've travelled 300 mile just to see me?

36:46.080 --> 36:47.760
You and Liddell.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.920
I'd heard you were both the best.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.080
And what do you think now?

36:52.160 --> 36:54.240
Eric Liddell?

36:54.320 --> 36:58.000
I've never seen such drive,
such commitment in a runner.

36:58.600 --> 37:00.680
He runs like a wild animal.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.560
He unnerves me.

37:02.640 --> 37:04.440
So he should.

37:04.520 --> 37:07.120
He frightens the living daylights out of me.

37:07.240 --> 37:09.960
I want you to help me take him on.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.760
Tell me, Mr Abrahams. Are you married?

37:14.840 --> 37:16.920
No. Why?

37:17.040 --> 37:18.480
Well...

37:18.560 --> 37:21.360
when the right girl comes along...

37:21.440 --> 37:24.720
how will you feel if she pops the question?

37:27.400 --> 37:29.480
You see, Mr Abrahams...

37:29.560 --> 37:31.520
like the bridegroom...

37:31.600 --> 37:34.120
it's the coach that should do the asking.

37:35.280 --> 37:37.320
Mr Mussabini...

37:37.400 --> 37:39.440
I can run fast.

37:39.560 --> 37:42.400
With your help, I think I can run even faster.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.840
Perhaps faster than any man ever ran.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.680
I want that Olympic medal.

37:48.520 --> 37:50.600
Now, I can see it there.

37:50.680 --> 37:52.880
It's waiting for me.

37:52.960 --> 37:55.040
But I can't get it on my own.

38:01.560 --> 38:04.200
Well, we've an old saying in my game, son.

38:05.160 --> 38:07.360
You can't put in what God's left out.

38:08.240 --> 38:10.200
Now, you leave it to me.

38:10.280 --> 38:13.640
I'll watch you. I'll observe.
And if I think I can help...

38:14.880 --> 38:17.520
if I can see the big prize hanging there...

38:17.600 --> 38:20.120
believe me, I won't waste any time.

38:20.200 --> 38:22.560
When we meet again...

38:22.640 --> 38:24.760
I'll be the one that does the begging.

38:24.840 --> 38:26.800
So you will watch me?

38:26.880 --> 38:28.960
Son, if you're good enough...

38:30.480 --> 38:33.320
I'll take you apart piece by bloody piece.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.080
Thank you.

- Didn't I tell you? Isn't she a peach?
- She's magnificent.

39:50.360 --> 39:52.840
Bravo! Bravo!

40:06.320 --> 40:08.200
I think it's going rather well.

40:08.280 --> 40:11.160
I've never seen this sort of thing,
but I am enjoying it.

40:11.240 --> 40:13.640
- And you, JB?
- I've done better shows myself.

40:13.720 --> 40:16.520
- Do you remember them offhand?
<i>- I don't!</i>

40:16.600 --> 40:18.880
So the stone heart's frail after all.

40:18.960 --> 40:22.200
- Abrahams is smitten, you say?
- Smitten? He's decapitated.

40:22.320 --> 40:25.120
- He won't listen to reason.
- The poor lad's in love!

40:25.240 --> 40:28.480
He's only just set eyes on her.
I've worshipped her for years.

40:28.560 --> 40:31.880
- By the way, where is he now?
- He's gone to ask her out to dinner.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.960
- Has he, by Jove!
- In the interval?!

40:35.800 --> 40:38.800
- Thank you. Mine, I take it?
- Harold.

40:39.880 --> 40:42.000
Lovely.

40:44.640 --> 40:45.680
Well?

40:45.760 --> 40:47.960
- Well what?
- Did you speak to her?

40:48.040 --> 40:49.120
Yes.

40:49.200 --> 40:50.680
- Is she coming?
- Yes.

40:50.800 --> 40:52.960
- To dinner?
- Yes.

40:53.040 --> 40:56.520
Her kid brother is athletics-mad.
Always talking about me!

40:56.640 --> 41:01.160
Monty, you'd better have my glass.
I've a terrible feeling you're going to need it.

41:01.240 --> 41:03.760
Sorry, Monty.

41:10.280 --> 41:12.680
Yes, thank you very much, sir.

41:12.760 --> 41:14.840
Yes, of course I will, sir.

41:19.880 --> 41:22.000
Good evening, Miss Gordon!

41:22.120 --> 41:24.200
A triumph, I hear.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.320
Who was that chap over there?

41:51.760 --> 41:53.840
Music critic of the <i>Star.</i>

41:53.920 --> 41:57.240
- Boring old buffer, really.
- Well, he obviously enjoyed it.

41:57.320 --> 41:59.440
I shouldn't think so.

41:59.520 --> 42:02.760
They always say that.
They save the poison for the print.

42:02.840 --> 42:06.720
- A bit off tonight, I thought.
- What? You were magnificent!

42:06.800 --> 42:08.880
Thank you.

42:08.960 --> 42:13.440
One of my little maids has gone and
got herself preggers with a gondolier.

42:13.520 --> 42:16.760
We had to shove her second on tonight.
The trio...

42:16.840 --> 42:20.720
- Your usual, Miss Gordon?
- Thank you, Toffy.

42:20.800 --> 42:22.920
And you, sir.

42:23.440 --> 42:24.800
Thank you.

42:24.920 --> 42:28.840
This is Mr Abrahams.
He's a very famous runner.

42:28.920 --> 42:31.960
He's trying your special
for the first time tonight.

42:32.040 --> 42:34.840
- I hope you enjoy it, sir.
- I'm sure I shall.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.760
Well, go on then!

42:41.160 --> 42:43.760
It's a secret concoction of Toffy's...

42:43.840 --> 42:45.920
a sort of cocktail <i>de maison...</i>

42:46.000 --> 42:48.320
so you'd jolly well better enjoy it.

42:49.080 --> 42:51.520
- Excellent.
- There, Toffy!

42:51.600 --> 42:54.080
You've won yourself a friend for life.

42:55.320 --> 42:57.400
My favourite, please.

42:59.320 --> 43:01.400
- For two.
- My pleasure.

43:04.360 --> 43:06.440
What have I ordered?

43:06.520 --> 43:08.360
Surprise.

43:08.440 --> 43:10.520
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.

43:17.240 --> 43:20.960
Well... the great Harold Abrahams.

43:21.600 --> 43:23.760
My brother will be insanely jealous.

43:23.840 --> 43:25.920
So will mine.

43:29.720 --> 43:31.800
You don't look very ruthless.

43:31.880 --> 43:33.480
Should I?

43:33.560 --> 43:37.440
According to my brother.
Tim says that's why you always win.

43:38.160 --> 43:40.680
- Why running?
- Why singing?

43:40.760 --> 43:42.760
It's my job.

43:45.240 --> 43:48.520
No, that's silly. I do it because I love it.

43:50.440 --> 43:52.600
Do you love running?

43:52.680 --> 43:56.600
I'm more of an addict.
It's a compulsion. A weapon.

43:56.680 --> 43:59.240
- Against what?
- Being Jewish, I suppose.

44:05.240 --> 44:07.200
You're not serious?!

44:07.280 --> 44:08.720
You're not Jewish...

44:08.840 --> 44:10.920
or you wouldn't ask.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.280
Fiddlesticks!

44:12.360 --> 44:14.440
People don't care.

44:16.640 --> 44:20.680
Anyway, being Jewish
hasn't done you any harm.

44:21.520 --> 44:23.600
I'm what I call semi-deprived.

44:23.680 --> 44:25.960
That sounds clever. What does it mean?

44:26.040 --> 44:29.800
It means they lead me to water,
but they won't let me drink.

44:31.760 --> 44:35.560
You're a funny old stick,
Mr Harold Abrahams.

44:36.640 --> 44:38.720
Funny...

44:38.800 --> 44:40.840
but fascinating.

44:40.920 --> 44:43.120
I'll settle for the fascinating.

44:43.200 --> 44:45.640
Life isn't that gloomy, is it?

44:48.080 --> 44:50.160
Not tonight.

44:53.560 --> 44:55.920
You're so beautiful.

44:57.720 --> 44:59.560
Like you.

44:59.640 --> 45:02.320
<i>Le pied de porc anglais, madame.</i>

45:04.600 --> 45:06.640
Pigs' trotters.

45:06.720 --> 45:08.640
Oh, my God.

45:20.880 --> 45:24.120
<i>The train arriving at platform two...</i>

45:24.200 --> 45:26.640
<i>is the Flying Scotsman from Aberdeen.</i>

45:26.720 --> 45:29.520
7.30, Mr Liddell! 7.30 on t'dot.

45:31.440 --> 45:33.720
There you are, sir. Hot tea and toast.

45:33.800 --> 45:35.200
Great.

45:35.280 --> 45:37.440
- You sleep all right?
- Like a log.

45:37.520 --> 45:40.080
Aye. Must have a clear conscience.

45:40.160 --> 45:42.240
Far from it.

45:42.320 --> 45:45.600
- Are we here?
- Aye, sir. Just pulled in. King's Cross.

45:45.680 --> 45:48.680
Oh, and here's the paper, with your picture in.

45:48.800 --> 45:51.200
Expecting great things, from all accounts.

45:51.280 --> 45:53.360
Are they indeed?

45:54.040 --> 45:56.760
- Here you are.
- Much obliged, sir.

45:56.840 --> 46:00.000
Now, no hurry. You've got
an hour before we kick you out.

46:00.080 --> 46:02.600
- And good luck for this afternoon.
- Thank you.

46:02.680 --> 46:04.880
Come on, sir. Wake up. King's Cross.

46:07.120 --> 46:10.440
Aye, Mr Abrahams. So's the Scot.

47:08.040 --> 47:10.160
Mr Abrahams?

47:11.160 --> 47:13.240
Mr Liddell.

47:14.600 --> 47:17.040
I'd like to wish you the best of success.

47:17.120 --> 47:20.280
Thank you. And may the best man win.

47:28.280 --> 47:30.360
<i>Get to your marks.</i>

47:42.360 --> 47:44.480
Get set.

47:57.560 --> 47:59.640
Extraordinary.

48:50.840 --> 48:52.920
<i>Harold.</i>

48:53.720 --> 48:55.800
Harold.

48:57.920 --> 49:00.040
This is absolutely ridiculous.

49:00.120 --> 49:03.440
It's a race you've lost, not a relative.
Nobody's dead.

49:05.120 --> 49:09.160
For goodness' sake, snap out of it, Harold.
You're behaving like a child.

49:09.240 --> 49:11.400
- I lost.
- I know!

49:12.000 --> 49:14.080
I was there, remember? Watching.

49:17.240 --> 49:19.320
It was marvellous.

49:19.960 --> 49:22.040
You were marvellous.

49:23.160 --> 49:25.520
He was more marvellous, that's all.

49:25.600 --> 49:27.680
On the day, the best man won.

49:27.760 --> 49:29.840
I had to look for him.

49:29.920 --> 49:32.760
It's absolutely fundamental. You never look.

49:34.280 --> 49:38.520
He was ahead. There was nothing you
could have done. He won fair and square.

49:38.600 --> 49:40.480
Well, that's that, Abrahams.

49:40.560 --> 49:43.160
If you can't take a beating, it's for the best.

49:43.240 --> 49:45.320
I don't run to take beatings!

49:47.160 --> 49:48.760
I run to win.

49:48.840 --> 49:50.960
If I can't win, I won't run.

49:52.520 --> 49:54.600
If you don't run, you can't win.

49:55.920 --> 49:58.160
Ring me when you've sorted that one out.

49:58.240 --> 50:00.320
Sybil...

50:01.320 --> 50:02.360
Don't go.

50:06.080 --> 50:08.160
I just don't know what to do.

50:08.240 --> 50:10.320
Try growing up.

50:31.360 --> 50:33.440
Harold.

50:34.080 --> 50:36.160
You're a great man.

50:36.240 --> 50:38.320
You ran like a god.

50:40.240 --> 50:43.320
I was proud of you. Don't make me ashamed.

50:43.400 --> 50:45.480
It's not the losing, Syb.

50:46.600 --> 50:49.320
Eric Liddell's a fine man and a fine runner.

50:49.400 --> 50:51.480
It's me!

50:51.560 --> 50:53.680
After all that work...

50:54.520 --> 50:56.880
now, God knows, what do I aim for?

50:58.720 --> 51:00.960
Beating him the next time.

51:02.600 --> 51:05.120
Sybil, I can't run any faster.

51:08.800 --> 51:10.880
<i>Mr Abrahams!</i>

51:11.680 --> 51:13.360
Mr Abrahams!

51:15.120 --> 51:17.240
I can find you another two yards.

51:28.520 --> 51:30.200
<i>Charlie Paddock.</i>

51:30.280 --> 51:33.520
Californian cannonball.
World's fastest human.

51:33.600 --> 51:35.880
Winner, 100 metres, Olympic Games...

51:35.960 --> 51:38.360
- 1920, Antwerp. Time?
- 10.3.

51:42.560 --> 51:44.680
Jackson Scholz...

51:44.760 --> 51:46.840
the New York Thunderbolt.

51:47.600 --> 51:49.720
Runner-up, Olympic Games, 1920.

51:49.800 --> 51:51.880
Lost by looking right.

51:51.960 --> 51:54.120
Look, here's the finish. You see?

51:54.200 --> 51:56.240
Paddock, leaping past him at the tape?

51:56.320 --> 51:58.520
That glance cost Scholz the race.

51:59.880 --> 52:01.960
- Scholz's fastest?
- 10.3... 4.

52:06.720 --> 52:10.240
Eric Liddell. Well, you know all about him.

52:10.320 --> 52:12.440
Look at them.

52:12.520 --> 52:14.840
Think them. Breathe them.

52:14.920 --> 52:19.040
I want their faces leering at you
every time you shut your eyes.

52:19.120 --> 52:21.800
The Flying Scotsman first.
That bloody well hurt.

52:21.920 --> 52:23.960
What, Eric Liddell?

52:24.040 --> 52:26.120
Well, he's no real problem.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.600
He's a great runner
but he needs to go further out.

52:30.680 --> 52:33.480
- He's no 100-metres man.
- He could have fooled me!

52:33.560 --> 52:35.400
Yeah, he's fast.

52:35.480 --> 52:39.160
But he won't go any faster, not in
the dash, anyway. He's a gut runner.

52:39.240 --> 52:41.320
He's all heart. Digs deep.

52:42.080 --> 52:44.160
A short sprint is run on nerves.

52:44.240 --> 52:47.520
- It's tailor-made for neurotics.
- Thanks very much.

52:47.600 --> 52:51.600
No, I mean it. You can push guts,
bully them, but you can hone nerves.

52:51.680 --> 52:54.960
Paddock, Scholz and Eric Liddell.

52:55.840 --> 52:57.920
Come here a minute, Mr Abrahams.

53:04.080 --> 53:06.760
Now, do you know
why you lost the other day?

53:06.840 --> 53:08.920
Because you're overstriding.

53:09.040 --> 53:11.080
Just a couple of inches. Now...

53:11.160 --> 53:15.040
These coins represent the strides
in your hundred metres.

53:18.560 --> 53:21.720
Have you got another two coins,
Mr Abrahams?

53:24.040 --> 53:26.160
Well, maybe we can find them.

53:26.240 --> 53:28.320
As I said...

53:28.400 --> 53:30.280
overstriding.

53:30.360 --> 53:32.360
Death to the sprinter.

53:33.160 --> 53:35.320
Slap in the face each stride you take.

53:35.440 --> 53:37.520
Knocks you back.

53:38.240 --> 53:40.960
Like that. Like that...

53:41.040 --> 53:43.120
and that!

53:44.360 --> 53:45.600
Now...

53:57.360 --> 54:00.080
I want you to imagine
you're running on hot bricks.

54:00.160 --> 54:03.640
If you leave your feet too long
on the ground, they'll get burnt.

54:03.720 --> 54:07.000
Up, up, up. Light, light, light!
Light as a feather.

54:31.200 --> 54:33.120
Set!

54:59.680 --> 55:02.560
No! Not your head back again!

55:02.640 --> 55:04.480
Get it level! Go and do it again.

55:04.560 --> 55:05.760
That's it!

55:13.400 --> 55:15.480
Faster, come on!

55:15.560 --> 55:17.920
Pass the car! Go on!

55:18.000 --> 55:19.480
Go on! Go on!

55:19.560 --> 55:21.800
Go on, go on, on, on!

55:22.680 --> 55:24.840
Come on, now! Keep it up, come on!

55:26.800 --> 55:29.360
Rhythm, Mr Abrahams, rhythm!

55:54.360 --> 55:58.240
<i>Training, training. All I ever hear is training.</i>

55:58.320 --> 56:01.160
<i>Do you believe in</i>
<i>what we're doing here or not?</i>

56:01.240 --> 56:03.320
Look, Jennie, I'm sorry.

56:05.040 --> 56:07.120
I was late. I apologise.

56:07.200 --> 56:10.360
- It's all very well, Eric.
- Look, I said I was sorry.

56:10.440 --> 56:13.400
To me. It's not me you've insulted.

56:13.480 --> 56:15.560
Away with your bother!

56:15.640 --> 56:18.440
The Lord'll not feel slighted
at the missing of a bus.

56:18.520 --> 56:20.840
Yes, Eric, you missed a bus. But why?

56:20.920 --> 56:23.000
Your mind's not with us any more, son.

56:23.120 --> 56:25.960
It's full of running and starting
and medals and pace.

56:26.080 --> 56:28.920
It's so full of it,
you've no room for standing still.

56:29.040 --> 56:31.520
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie!

56:31.600 --> 56:33.680
Don't fret yourself.

56:34.240 --> 56:36.320
I do fret myself, Eric.

56:36.960 --> 56:39.040
I'm frightened for you.

56:39.120 --> 56:41.800
I'm frightened for what it all might do to you.

56:52.640 --> 56:57.280
<i>Please, Mr Liddell.</i>
Would you sign your name, please?

56:57.400 --> 56:59.240
Surely.

57:01.560 --> 57:03.640
You want to pick yourself a pen?

57:11.280 --> 57:13.360
- There you are.
- Thanks.

57:27.360 --> 57:30.880
Come on, Jennie, let's go for a walk.
I've got something to say.

57:45.040 --> 57:47.640
It's a sight and a half, in't it, Jennie?

57:58.880 --> 58:01.240
Auld Reekie. I'll be sad to leave it.

58:15.160 --> 58:16.960
I've decided.

58:17.600 --> 58:19.680
I'm going back to China.

58:19.800 --> 58:22.400
The missionary service have accepted me.

58:23.400 --> 58:25.720
Oh, I'm so pleased!

58:25.800 --> 58:28.320
But I've got a lot of running to do first.

58:29.440 --> 58:31.560
Jennie...

58:31.640 --> 58:33.960
Jennie, you've got to understand.

58:37.080 --> 58:39.640
I believe that God made me for a purpose.

58:40.560 --> 58:42.720
For China.

58:42.800 --> 58:44.880
But he also made me fast.

58:46.120 --> 58:49.400
And when I run... I feel his pleasure.

58:51.040 --> 58:53.920
To give it up would be
to hold him in contempt.

58:54.960 --> 58:57.080
You were right.

58:57.600 --> 58:59.680
It's not just fun.

59:00.360 --> 59:03.400
To win is to honour him.

59:05.760 --> 59:07.880
Jennie...

59:08.680 --> 59:10.800
Jennie.

59:11.160 --> 59:13.240
I've got my degree to get.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.080
All that work.

59:16.960 --> 59:19.040
Then there's Paris.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.080
The Olympic Games.

59:24.600 --> 59:26.680
There's just not enough of me.

59:28.240 --> 59:31.320
I'm asking you to manage
the mission on your own...

59:31.400 --> 59:33.480
till then.

59:34.520 --> 59:36.600
Will you do that for me, Jennie?

59:54.560 --> 59:56.640
<i>Andy, I've lost him.</i>

59:56.720 --> 59:58.480
Can't reach him.

59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.120
<i>You will, old girl. You will.</i>

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.040
He says he needs to clear his mind of me.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.960
He can't love me and say that.

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.640
Syb.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.240
The world's against him, or so he believes.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.800
Now he's got a chance to prove himself.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:25.160
He can't see or hear anything
beyond that, not even you.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:29.080
It's hard, I know,
but you've just got to try and understand.

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.320
- Why should I?
- Because he's what you want, isn't he?

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:36.400
What about you?

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.520
And Stallard and Aubrey?

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.520
You're still the same.
The chance is there for you too.

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.880
To be <i>a fastest, yes, but not the fastest.</i>

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.240
The fastest man ever before.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.280
Father's never going to learn how to do that.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.400
That's immortality.

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:56.360
Just think what it means to a man like Harold.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:00.080
Well, to me the whole thing's fun.
I don't need that.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.240
"Cast care aside" and all that.

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:07.840
But for Harold, it's a matter of life and death.

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:10.160
- So all I can do is wait?
- 'Fraid so.

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.440
And pray like hell that he wins!

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:15.960
And if he doesn't?

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.840
You mustn't worry, old thing.

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.960
I've never ever seen a man
so smitten as our Harold.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.200
It's just that I'm a little envious, that's all.

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.880
Oh, Andy.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.920
- Your parasol, Miss Gordon.
- Thank you, Mildred.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.520
Good luck tonight.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.720
He's a damned fool!

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.560
I always thought the Irish had all the luck!

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.800
- John, Savoy Theatre.
- Yes, sir.

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:49.960
Splendid.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.160
Mildred, would you get my spikes?

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.360
Ready, my lord!

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.360
Now, Coote, if I shed a drop I want to know.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.520
Touch but not spill, what?

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.120
<i>Life slips by, Abrahams.</i>

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:33.520
<i>Life slips by.</i>

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:38.080
But this fine old university of ours,
she offers some rare consolations.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.240
Beyond measure, sir.

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.920
I can take it, then, that you would
be acutely grieved to discover...

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.760
that any behaviour or action
on your part were causing her grief?

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:50.520
Naturally, sir. I would, deeply.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.680
Good. I was sure of it.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:58.120
Here in Cambridge, we've always
been proud of our athletic prowess.

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:02.320
We believe, we've always believed,
that our games are indispensable...

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.720
in helping to complete
the education of an Englishman.

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.880
They create character.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.760
They foster courage, honesty and leadership.

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:15.480
But most of all,
an unassailable spirit of loyalty...

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.640
comradeship and mutual responsibility.

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:22.920
- Would you agree?
- Yes, sir. I would.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.520
I'm afraid there is a growing suspicion
in the bosom of this university...

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.840
and I tell you this without in any way...

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.200
decrying your achievements,
in which we all rejoice...

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:40.880
that in your enthusiasm for success...

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:44.080
you have perhaps lost sight
of some of these ideals.

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:48.880
May I ask what form
this disloyalty, this betrayal, takes?

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.240
- Oh, hardly betrayal!
- The word grief was mentioned.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.640
It's said that you use a personal coach.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.880
Mr Mussabini, yes.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.040
- Is he Italian?
- Of Italian extraction, yes.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.120
- I see.
- But not all Italian.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:09.120
- I'm relieved to hear it.
- He's half Arab!

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:18.120
Do we take it that you employ this
Mr Mussabini on a professional basis?

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:22.760
Sam Mussabini is the finest,
most advanced...

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:26.160
clearest-thinking athletics coach
in the country.

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.680
I'm honoured to be worthy of his attention.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.840
Nevertheless, he's a professional.

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:33.040
What else would he be? He's the best.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:37.040
But there, Mr Abrahams,
I'm afraid our paths diverge.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:41.640
You see, this university believes
that the way of the amateur...

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:45.120
is the only one to provide
satisfactory results.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.280
I am an amateur.

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.520
You're being trained by a professional.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.000
You've adopted a professional attitude.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:56.720
For the past year, you have concentrated
on developing your own technique...

01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:00.920
in the headlong pursuit,
may I suggest, of individual glory.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.240
Not a policy very conducive to
the fostering of <i>esprit de corps.</i>

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:08.920
I am a Cambridge man first and last.

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:12.280
I am an Englishman first and last.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:17.680
What I have achieved, what I intend
to achieve, is for my family...

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:21.080
my university and my country.

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:25.280
And I bitterly resent
your suggesting otherwise.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.520
Your aim is to win at all costs, is it not?

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:32.320
At all costs, no.
But I do aim to win within the rules.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:35.280
Perhaps you would rather
I played the gentleman and lost?

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:37.920
To playing the tradesman, yes.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:46.640
My dear boy, your approach has been,
if I may say so, a little too plebeian.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.560
You are the elite...

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:52.520
and are therefore expected
to behave as such.

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:03.920
Thank you, sir...

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.760
for your hospitality.

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.520
The evening has been most illuminating.

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:13.920
Good night to you, sir.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.560
You know, gentlemen...

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.800
you yearn for victory, just as I do.

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:25.960
But achieved with
the apparent effortlessness of gods.

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:30.720
Yours are the archaic values
of the prep school playground.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.240
You deceive no one but yourselves.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:37.880
I believe in the pursuit of excellence...

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.440
and I'll carry the future with <i>me.</i>

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.280
Well, there goes your Semite, Hugh.

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.840
A different god.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.640
A different mountain top.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:16.120
<i>Harold! Harold! We're in.</i>

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:20.440
All of us!
You, Henry, Andy and me, we're all in!

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:23.040
You 100 and 200, Andy 400 and hurdles...

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.840
Henry the mile, and me the steeplechase.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.000
Paris, here we come!

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.240
Eric Liddell's picked too.

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:33.320
Rivals under the same flag.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.480
Your chance to get even, eh?

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:37.760
I can't wait.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.320
Welcome to Dover, my Lord Birkenhead.

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.760
Lord Birkenhead,
are the Yanks so well trained...

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.160
that they'll wipe the floor with our boys?

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:49.960
It's certainly true that
the Americans have prepared seriously...

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:52.600
some would say too seriously,
to gain success.

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:57.360
But we feel we may, in our
unsophisticated way, have their match.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:00.160
Sir, do you think
the British team stand a chance...

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:04.960
against such great American athletes
as Charlie Paddock and Jackson Scholz?

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:08.840
You Americans have a number of men
who are rated as world-beaters...

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:13.560
but this contest is in Europe,
not in the rarefied climes of the United States.

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:16.479
Parisian conditions are bound
to be more robust...

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:19.680
more combative and certainly more cavalier.

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:22.840
Lord Birkenhead,
are the Yanks so well trained...

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:25.680
that they will wipe the floor with our boys?

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:28.279
Gentlemen, Abrahams, Liddell and Lindsay...

01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:31.439
We have the men who could
give them a run for their money.

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:37.680
Eric!

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:43.040
Sandy! You haven't come all the way
from Scotland just to see me off, have you?

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.160
I have not. I'm seeing myself off.

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:47.319
Come on, or we'll miss the boat.

01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:51.240
Hey, Mr Liddell! What do you think
of your chances against Abrahams?

01:08:51.319 --> 01:08:53.399
I'll do my best. Can do no less.

01:08:53.479 --> 01:08:55.560
Mr Liddell, sir!

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.200
What about the qualifying heats on Sunday?

01:08:58.279 --> 01:09:00.720
- What did you say?
- On Sunday!

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.279
Do you think you can beat the Americans?

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.680
There's Mr Abrahams! There he is!

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:08.880
- Mr Abrahams!
- Sorry, I've no time...

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.319
Hello, Jeremy.

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:13.120
- Gilbert and Sullivan will win.
- Thanks very much.

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.760
- Harold!
- Sybil.

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:24.279
- I came to wish you luck.
- I'm glad.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:32.319
I understand. I wanted you to know that.

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:36.920
I'll be here when you come back.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.080
<i>Hurry along, Mr Abrahams.</i>
She's about to sail!

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:51.200
I must go. I'll see you in three weeks.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.400
Bye-bye.

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:02.720
Mind your step, sir.
We want you to get there in one piece.

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:50.400
- When did you get to know?
- Did you not read the papers this morning?

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:54.240
The heats for the 100 are on
the Sunday after the opening ceremony...

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.880
the semis and final a couple of days after.

01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:59.560
It's only a heat.

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.920
Does it make all that difference?

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.480
Yeah.

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.640
Yeah, it does.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:20.000
And strong though the temptation may be...

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:24.680
to disport your newly acquired finery
around the streets of Paris...

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:27.720
if they aren't temptation enough...

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:30.720
may I ask you on behalf
of the Olympic Committee...

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.680
to save your sartorial splendour...

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.200
until at least after the opening ceremony.

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:37.920
May I remind you...

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.080
you are the favoured few.

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:43.480
You constitute what is without doubt...

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:47.440
the most powerful athletic force
ever to leave these shores.

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.400
You are to face the world's best...

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:53.240
brown and yellow, white and black...

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:55.440
young and ardent as yourselves...

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.880
fleet of foot and strong of limb...

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:03.120
from every civilised nation
on the face of the earth.

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:05.400
I have no doubt...

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:09.640
that you will acquit yourselves
honourably and... with distinction.

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:15.360
Good luck to you all.

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:34.480
<i>Your mind's not with us any more.</i>

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.600
<i>It's full of sprinting and starting</i>
<i>and medals and pace.</i>

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:40.480
<i>It's so full of it,</i>
<i>you've no room for standing still!</i>

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:43.520
<i>Jennie, Jennie! Don't fret yourself.</i>

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:47.440
<i>I do fret myself, Eric. I'm frightened for you.</i>

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:50.240
<i>I'm frightened what it all might do to you.</i>

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:56.360
<i>- Do you know what day it is?</i>
<i>- Yeah. Sunday.</i>

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:59.800
<i>The Sabbath's not a day</i>
<i>for playing football, is it?</i>

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:06.440
<i>It's an awful step you're taking, Liddell.</i>

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:08.800
<i>The whole of Britain will be watching you.</i>

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:11.360
I don't know that they'll understand.

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.240
I'm not sure that <i>I understand.</i>

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.560
I'm not sure that I do either, sir.

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:25.560
For the last three years
I've devoted myself to my running...

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:27.800
just to be on this ship.

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:29.960
I gave up my rugby.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:32.120
My work has suffered.

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:35.680
And I've deeply hurt someone
I hold very dear.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:39.040
Because I told myself...

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:41.880
if I win, I win for God.

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:46.600
And now I find myself sitting here,
destroying it all.

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:50.360
But I have to.

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.560
To run would be against God's law.

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.360
I was mistaken.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.240
My boy - as things stand, you must not run.

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:07.560
But I want you
to hold your fire for a while, Liddell.

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:09.760
Leave everything to me.

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:14.520
Say nothing. Wait until we get to Paris.

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:17.280
I'll have a word with the French.

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.560
I'm not without a certain pull...

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.760
and we fought in the war together.

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.920
They do owe us something.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.080
I don't understand.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:29.120
They're not a very principled lot, the Frogs.

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.680
But, when faced with a stand like yours...

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.840
one never knows.

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:37.000
I might get through.

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:43.160
I just might possibly persuade them.

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:47.320
The French, sir?

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.480
What can they do?

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:52.320
Shift that bloody heat of yours, of course.

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.480
Good evening.

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:03.000

I'm from Oxford, sir. They wrote to me.

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:31.480
Said as I was over here,
I might as well take part.

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:34.600
- Economical. But can you run?
- I'll give it a try, sir.

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:38.360
- That's the spirit. Best of luck to you.
- Thank you, sir.

He's here to show us what may be done -
and more essentially, what may not be.

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:10.400
Jackson Scholz. How do you do?

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.640
I'm Eric Liddell.

Well, we've heard a lot about you.

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:20.720
Liddell!

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:22.880
Excuse me.

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.600
I was afraid you weren't here.

01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:27.760
I'm afraid I am, sir.

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:30.480
Fine. Do you good.

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:32.680
Take you out of yourself a bit.

01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:35.920
The Prince of Wales would like to meet you.

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:38.600
No.

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:40.760
No. No, sir.

01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:42.360
It wouldn't be right.

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:45.960
Liddell... he is your future king.

01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:48.320
Are you refusing to shake his hand?

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:51.200
Does your arrogance extend that far?

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.200
My arrogance, sir, extends
just as far as my conscience demands.

01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.200
Fine.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:03.760
Then let's hope that's wise enough
to give you room for manoeuvre.

01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.440
All right, sir.

01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:12.680
Splendid. I'll take you to him now.

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:32.560
Your Royal Highness,
may I present Mr Eric Liddell?

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:34.720
Delighted, Liddell. Delighted.

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:37.680
I saw you play for Scotland.
It depressed me no end.

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:40.080
Ran in a couple of tries from your own half.

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:42.120
I believe I did, sir, yes.

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:44.760
Nice to have you on the same side at last.

01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:48.120
Excellent effort of Lindsay's, don't you think?

01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:51.520
- He did well, sir. He did indeed.
- An example to us all.

01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:56.120
Eric, may I introduce
His Grace the Duke of Sutherland...

01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:58.440
president of our Olympic Association?

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:01.680
- How do you do?
- And our chairman, Lord Cadogan.

01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:05.120
<i>Have a seat.</i>

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:08.040
Make yourself comfortable.

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:10.440
Cigar?

01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:13.320
Oh, no, of course. You don't. Nor drink.

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:18.080
Such is the resolution of the young man
you have before you, gentlemen.

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:27.560
Lord Birkenhead has advised us
as to your attitude...

01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:31.400
towards your participation
in the 100-metres heats, Liddell.

01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:34.320
Or would your non-participation
be more accurate?

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:36.480
It would, sir, yes.

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:39.880
We were also consulted as to
how we should approach the French.

01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:44.520
Something we can't allow, going
cap in hand to the Frogs, of all people!

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.680
Simply out of the question.

01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:51.040
A simple matter of national dignity.
Being a patriot, I'm sure you understand.

01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:54.200
I must say, sir,
I felt it was an impractical suggestion.

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.680
Why didn't you damn well say so?

01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:59.040
As an athlete, you value economy of effort.

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:02.800
I wanted to run.
I was desperate enough to try anything.

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:05.360
Well, all that being understood...

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:08.200
we decided to invite you in for a little chat...

01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:11.520
to see if there's any way
we can help resolve the situation.

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:16.160
<i>There's only one solution. That's</i>
for this man to change his mind and run.

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:18.560
<i>Don't state the obvious, Cadogan.</i>

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:23.680
We've to explore ways in which we can help
this young man to reach that decision.

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.120
I'm afraid there are no ways, sir.

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:29.480
I won't run on the Sabbath and that's final.

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:34.200
I intended to confirm this
with Lord Birkenhead tonight...

01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:37.560
even before you called me up
before this inquisition.

01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:39.040
Don't be impertinent.

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:43.680
The impertinence lies with those who
seek to influence a man to deny his beliefs.

01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:47.200
On the contrary, Liddell.
We're appealing to your beliefs.

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:50.600
In your country and your king.
Your loyalty to them.

01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:55.640
Hear, hear.
In my day, it was king first, God after.

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:58.600
And the war to end wars
bitterly proved your point.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:02.440
God made countries. God makes kings...

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.680
and the rules by which they govern.

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:10.480
And those rules say that the Sabbath is his.

01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:13.920
And I for one intend to keep it that way.

01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:19.120
<i>Mr Liddell.</i>

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:22.120
You're a child of your race... as I am.

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:26.760
We share a common heritage,
a common bond, a common... loyalty.

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:30.760
There are times when
we are asked to make sacrifices...

01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:32.920
in the name of that loyalty...

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.520
and without them
our allegiance is worthless.

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:38.840
As I see it, for you...

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:41.720
this is such a time.

01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:44.280
Sir...

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:48.360
God knows, I love my country.

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:51.640
But I can't make that sacrifice.

01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:00.360
<i>Come in!</i>

01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:04.780
Your Royal Highness... Lord Lindsay.

01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:12.940
Your Highness, Cadogan, gentlemen.

01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:15.780
I do apologise for barging in like this.

01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:18.420
The fact is
I am fully aware of Eric's dilemma.

01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:23.340
I wondered if I could be so bold
as to suggest a possible solution.

01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:25.980
<i>Do.</i>

01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:27.740
Yes.

01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:29.900
Another day, another race.

01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:32.060
What the devil's that supposed to mean?

01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:34.340
It's quite simple as a matter of fact, sir.

01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:36.860
The 400 metres. It's on Thursday.

01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:39.020
I've already got my medal.

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:42.940
So why don't you let Eric
take my place in the quarter?

01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:47.460
I think that's a splendid idea.

01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:50.740
Can we allow him to change events
at such short notice?

01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:54.660
That's a matter for the committee.

01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:56.860
We <i>are the committee.</i>

01:30:57.540 --> 01:30:59.620
I think it's a very good idea.

01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:02.060
David?

01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:05.020
All those in favour say aye.

01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:07.060
<i>Aye.</i>

01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:09.220
Liddell?

01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:11.900
- Andy, I...
- A pleasure, old chap.

01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:15.900
Just to see you run.

01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:21.860
Aye.

01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:23.860
<i>Well, that's settled.</i>

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:30.980
A sticky moment, George.

01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:35.060
Thank God for Lindsay.
I thought the lad had us beaten.

01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:37.260
He did have us beaten, FE.

01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:40.580
- And thank God he did.
- I don't quite follow you.

01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:43.580
The lad, as you call him,
is a true man of principle...

01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:45.380
and a true athlete.

01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:48.580
His speed is a mere extension
of his life, its force.

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:51.900
We sought to sever his running
from himself.

01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:54.100
For his country's sake, yes.

01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:56.260
No sake is worth that, FE.

01:31:57.020 --> 01:31:59.460
Least of all a guilty national pride.

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:19.280
<i>"Lindsay makes way for Liddell."</i>

01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:22.280
"400 metres for defecting Scot."

01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:25.080
"'Smacks of fanaticism, ' says official."

01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:27.360
"'Man of principle, ' says primate."

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:29.520
"We should be proud."

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:14.480
- So that's the Olympic Stadium.
- That's it, Sam.

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:16.680
It's as good as being in there, isn't it?

01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:19.600
Better! Seeing as I'm <i>persona non grata.</i>

01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:23.080
Yeah.

01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:26.080
It's tiptop, Mr Abrahams.
You've done a grand job.

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:28.240
If we don't win now, we never will.

01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:31.000
Have I got everything, Sam?
Everything you need?

01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:33.120
Er...

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:38.240
Yes.

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:41.040
All we need now is Sunday.

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:08.040
<i>My text this afternoon</i>
is taken from Isaiah, chapter 40.

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:12.960
Behold.

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:16.200
The nations are as a drop in the bucket...

01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:20.560
<i>and are counted</i>
<i>as the small dust in the balance.</i>

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:26.360
<i>All nations before him are as nothing.</i>

01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:30.440
They are counted to him less than nothing...

01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:32.320
and vanity.

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.880
He bringeth the princes to nothing.

01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:41.560
He maketh the judges of the earth as a vanity.

01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:45.360
Hast thou not known?

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:48.680
<i>Hast thou not heard...</i>

01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:52.840
<i>that the everlasting God, the Lord...</i>

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.440
<i>the creator of the ends of the earth...</i>

01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:57.440
<i>fainteth not...</i>

01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:59.600
<i>neither is weary?</i>

01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:01.800
Juvenile!

01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:08.640
Oldest con in the business.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.080
I know, Sam.

01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:13.760
He giveth power to the faint...

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:16.880
and to them that have no strength...

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:20.160
he increaseth might.

01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:25.600
<i>But they that wait upon the Lord...</i>

01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:28.720
<i>shall renew their strength.</i>

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:31.520
<i>They shall mount up...</i>

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:35.560
with wings, as eagles.

01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:39.760
<i>They shall run...</i>

01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:41.960
<i>and not be weary.</i>

01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:45.480
<i>They shall walk...</i>

01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:48.200
<i>and not faint.</i>

01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:24.920
<i>Do you remember when we first</i>
bumped into each other, old man?

01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:28.520
We shared a taxi, remember?

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:33.320
You made me feel...

01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:36.560
an age old, burdened, sour...

01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:39.320
Even superior.

01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:43.280
That was <i>the miscalculation of my life.</i>

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:47.720
You, Aubrey...

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:50.160
are my most complete man.

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:52.320
You're brave...

01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:54.360
compassionate...

01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:56.440
kind.

01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:58.600
A content man.

01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:00.800
That's your secret.

01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:02.960
Contentment.

01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:06.120
I'm 24 and I've never known it.

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:11.760
I'm forever in pursuit and I don't
even know what it is I'm chasing.

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.520
Aubrey, old chap, I'm scared.

01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:26.560
Sam and I, we've laboured,
rowed and bullied for this.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.080
Day in, day out.

01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:33.200
You've seen us -
chuckled over us, I'll be bound.

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:35.240
Out in all weathers.

01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:37.400
Madmen.

01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:39.920
And for what?

01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:43.200
I was beaten out of sight in the 200.

01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:47.120
Then I let Paddock trick me in the semi.

01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:52.080
Now, in one hour's time,
I'll be out there again.

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:56.480
I'll raise my eyes
and look down that corridor...

01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:01.280
four-feet wide with ten lonely seconds
to justify my whole existence.

01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:06.040
But will I?

01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:13.320
Aubrey, I've known the fear of losing.

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:16.520
But now I'm almost too frightened to win.

01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:26.800
<i>Dear Mr Abrahams.</i>

01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:30.400
<i>You must please pardon</i>
<i>my not coming to see you run...</i>

01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:32.760
<i>much as I would like to do so.</i>

01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:36.920
<i>However, I believe and hope you will win...</i>

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.080
<i>the 100 metres.</i>

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.720
<i>Go out determined to do your best.</i>

01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:43.680
<i>And don't forget...</i>

01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:46.680
<i>drop down at the first stride.</i>

01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:50.400
<i>Get well warmed up...</i>

01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:52.760
<i>and then let the gun release you.</i>

01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:58.320
<i>I should use the springy old six-spike shoes.</i>

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:02.040
<i>All the best of luck.</i>

01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:04.240
<i>From yours truly, Sam Mussabini.</i>

01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:11.280
<i>PS. Please accept the charm.</i>

01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:13.920
<i>My old father swore by it.</i>

01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:22.400
No regrets, Eric,
that you're not down there with them?

01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:26.720
Yeah.

01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:29.840
No doubts, though.

01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:34.000
Your Royal Highness, may I present
Mr Bowman of the United States?

01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:35.960
Mr Bowman.

01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:38.320
- Mr Murchison.
- Mr Murchison.

01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:41.520
And Mr Watson of New Zealand
I believe you know.

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:44.240
- Oh, yes, Mr Watson. How are you?
- Very well, sir.

01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:45.720
Good.

01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:48.760
- Mr Paddock.
- Mr Paddock.

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:52.120
Dinner for your whole team at my club
when we get back to London.

01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:56.040
Now if you win, I pay,
Abrahams wins, you pay, all right?

01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:00.120
Sir, you have yourself a deal.

01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:02.560
Done.

01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:04.840
- The best of luck to you.
- And to you, sir.

01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:07.040
- Mr Scholz.
- Scholz.

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:09.320
And this is our Harold Abrahams.

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:11.600
- Good luck, Abrahams.
- Thank you, sir.

01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:13.960
Do your best. That's all we can expect.

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:17.440
- Good luck, Abrahams.
- Thank you, sir.

01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:19.840
Come on, Charlie!

01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:33.040
Charlie, Charlie, rah rah rah!

01:44:58.080 --> 01:44:59.720
<i>Prêt!</i>

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:01.560
Head down.

01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:03.760
<i>Watch the first stride.</i>

01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:06.720
<i>Go for release.</i>

01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:27.920
<i>Premier...</i>

01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:30.120
<i>numéro 419.</i>

01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:33.920
<i>Abrahams, Grande Bretagne.</i>

01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:40.560
<i>Temps, 10 secondes, trois cinquièmes.</i>

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:44.400
<i>Second, 74.</i>

01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:46.560
<i>Scholz, ةtats Unis.</i>

01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:35.680
Harold!

01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:56.480
My son.

01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:20.360
- Harold!
- Ssh, ssh, ssh!

01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:22.560
Leave him be. The poor fella's whacked.

01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:25.080
- But he won!
- Exactly.

01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:28.520
One of these days, Monty,
you're going to win yourself.

01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:31.080
And it's pretty difficult to swallow.

01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:40.040
Come in.

01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:43.360
Mrs Abrahams just rang, miss.

01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:46.520
The <i>Daily Express.</i>
They've been on from Paris.

01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:48.480
Mr 'Arold. He won!

01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:50.480
She told me to tell you he won!

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.120
Thank you very much, Bill.

01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:59.440
Oh, it's 15 minutes to curtain-up, miss.

01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:15.160
He did it, sir.

01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:22.160
Thank you, Matthews.

01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:25.520
"Abrahams triumphant."

01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:30.280
"Caius College athlete
wins blue riband at Games."

01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:33.880
Just as I expected.

01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:48.640
<i>Yes, you've always thought</i>
of yourself as a ruthless man. Hard.

01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:50.640
Bit of a loner, like me.

01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:55.160
But actually,
you're as soft as a limp pocket.

01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:58.920
Oh, you care.

01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:03.400
Care about things that really matter.

01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:08.040
If you didn't, I wouldn't have come
within a mile of you.

01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:15.000
Do you know who you won for
out there today?

01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:19.800
Us!

01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:22.840
You and old Sam Mussabini.

01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:26.640
I've waited 30 bloody years for this.

01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:29.800
<i>Pardon, messieurs. Il faut partir maintenant.</i>

01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:31.800
<i>Il est trois heures du matin.</i>

01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:32.880
Oh!

01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:36.760
Harold!

01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:41.040
It means the world to me, this, you know.

01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:45.480
And if all the world can do...

01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:49.120
is to want to go home to bed,
then they can go to hell!

01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:52.640
Because we've had today...

01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:54.680
you and me...

01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:56.840
and we've got it for keeps.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.120
So now it's out o' yer system...

01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:03.960
go home to that girl o' yours
and start some bloody living.

01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:05.720
Yes?

01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:19.120
- To Sam Mussabini.
- Oh.

01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:22.000
The greatest trainer in the world.

01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:24.120
Hm?

01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:34.280
<i>Tell him. Get some more.</i>

01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:36.920
<i>Come on, Sam. We're going home.</i>

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.080
<i>The final of the 400 metres.</i>

01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:06.520
<i>Taylor. ةtats Unis.</i>

01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:09.440
<i>Numéro 278.</i>

01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:13.240
Good luck. Don't expect
I'll see you till after the race.

01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:21.400
What's the deal with this guy Liddell?
Is he a problem?

01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:23.560
No problem. He's a flyer.

01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:26.400
He's had two races today already. He'll die.

01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:30.360
Just swing along, you guys, and wait.

01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:35.440
After 300 metres, rigor mortis sets in.

01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:37.640
You'll pull him in on a rope.

01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:44.640
Good luck, Taylor.

01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:47.240
- Watch out for Liddell.
- Coach says no problem.

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:49.480
He's got something personal to prove.

01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:52.320
Something guys like Coach'll
never understand.

01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:58.520
<i>Excuse me.</i>

01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:00.680
Jennie!

01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:06.120
<i>USA! USA! USA!</i>

01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:17.600
It says in the Old Book,
"He that honours me...

01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:20.240
I will honour."

01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:23.000
"Good luck. Jackson Scholz."

01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:27.960
<i>ہ vos marques!</i>

01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:35.480
<i>Prêt!</i>

01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:56.520
<i>So where does the power come from...</i>

01:53:56.600 --> 01:53:58.600
<i>to see the race to its end?</i>

01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:00.240
<i>From within.</i>

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.880
Come on, Liddell!

01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:24.840
<i>Jennie...</i>

01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:27.120
<i>I believe God made me for a purpose.</i>

01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:31.040
<i>But he also made me fast.</i>

01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:34.480
<i>And when I run...</i>

01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:36.640
<i>I feel his pleasure.</i>

01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:18.760
<i>Premier, Liddell. Grande Bretagne.</i>

01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:23.920
<i>47 secondes, trois cinquièmes.</i>

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.600
<i>Nouveau record olympique</i>
<i>et mondial amateur.</i>

01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:54.880

Hm? What's that, old boy?

01:59:04.680 --> 01:59:06.760
He ran them off their feet.
