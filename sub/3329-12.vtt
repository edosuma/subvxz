WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:02.624
Previously on Elementary...

00:02.670 --> 00:04.160
How much heroin
is that?
Oh, that's enough.

00:07.140 --> 00:11.133
Wow.
Please make
yourself at home.

00:11.170 --> 00:13.070
We want you to be as
comfortable here at Leda

00:13.110 --> 00:14.099
as you were at
your old job.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.374
We found your
nutmeg concoction.

00:17.410 --> 00:18.377
What are you talking about?

00:18.410 --> 00:20.219
You dissolve
corpses for money.

00:20.250 --> 00:23.219
GREGSON: Her name is
Melanie Vilkas, 24 years old.

00:23.250 --> 00:24.478
She went missing a few days ago.

00:24.520 --> 00:26.385
And the reason I couldn't
bring Kitty with me?

00:26.420 --> 00:28.285
GREGSON:
Take a look at her back.

00:28.320 --> 00:31.323
They're the same markings
that are on Kitty's back.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.328
This is why I became
a detective--

00:33.360 --> 00:35.157
to hunt this man.
I'm ready.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.394
HOLMES:
Simon de Merville.

00:36.430 --> 00:37.829
Lengthy record.

00:37.870 --> 00:40.566
He's not the man
who raped me.
What?

00:40.600 --> 00:43.330
I'm watching the news-- the man
you were looking for was killed.

00:43.370 --> 00:45.235
Yeah, at least it's over.

00:45.270 --> 00:46.476
Who was that?

00:46.510 --> 00:48.637
My boss at Leda,
Del Gruner. Why?

00:48.680 --> 00:52.116
DEL: And insurance is
a $4 trillion industry.

00:52.150 --> 00:53.139
KI'I'I'Y:
I was wrong, Watson.

00:53.180 --> 00:55.671
De Merville didn't hurt me.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.312
He did.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.299
MAN: Ms. Winter, to what
do I owe the pleasure?

01:06.330 --> 01:11.120
Uh, it's-it's been almost a week
since I sent you my report.

01:11.170 --> 01:12.762
Ijust... I wanted to
know your thoughts.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.337
Not much we don't
already know, hmm?

01:15.370 --> 01:19.579
Latif Malak was taken
on his way home from school

01:19.610 --> 01:21.305
six months ago.

01:21.340 --> 01:23.308
His parents received
a ransom note.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.272
We left it where
the kidnappers asked,

01:25.310 --> 01:27.278
only they never collected it.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.311
And Latif was
never returned.

01:31.320 --> 01:34.255
What did you think of the
bit about the backpack?

01:40.800 --> 01:42.358
This is Latif's backpack,

01:42.400 --> 01:44.129
the one that you found
in the allewNay

01:44.170 --> 01:46.297
that he would cut through on
his way home from school, right?

01:46.340 --> 01:47.693
Where did
you get that?

01:47.740 --> 01:50.607
Only, look at this-- the
chest clasp is closed.

01:50.640 --> 01:53.279
You thought that the bag came
loose during a struggle,

01:53.310 --> 01:55.278
but I defy you
to shake it off anyone

01:55.310 --> 01:57.278
when that clasp is locked.

02:00.420 --> 02:01.910
Someone took Latif
and his backpack,

02:01.950 --> 02:03.508
then once he was stashed,

02:03.550 --> 02:05.780
they came back and they planted
the bag in the allewNay.

02:05.820 --> 02:07.253
Which would mean
that the abduction

02:07.290 --> 02:08.587
happened somewhere else.

02:08.620 --> 02:10.258
Which means that you
haven't actually examined

02:10.290 --> 02:11.154
the real crime scene.

02:11.190 --> 02:13.226
Let's just cut to the chase,
shall we?

02:13.260 --> 02:15.899
You want me to talk
to John Hodge again.

02:15.930 --> 02:17.591
He is a registered sex offender

02:17.630 --> 02:19.769
whose flat Latif would walk by
every single day.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.803
You think that the kidnapper
killed Latif by accident--

02:22.840 --> 02:24.808
that's why he never came back
to retrieve his ransom.

02:24.840 --> 02:27.377
But I think it's because he
already had what he wanted--

02:27.410 --> 02:29.241
Latif.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.339
You're a very pretty
girl, Ms. Winter.

02:31.380 --> 02:33.439
But you're
not police.

02:33.480 --> 02:37.587
You mind your business,
and we'll mind ours, all right?

02:51.770 --> 02:53.761
Problem?

02:54.800 --> 02:56.529
You're just
in my way.

02:58.610 --> 03:00.601
Thank you.

03:07.580 --> 03:09.844
(footsteps approaching)

03:09.890 --> 03:11.846
She's asleep finally.

03:11.890 --> 03:13.414
I'm worried.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.451
These last few days
were a lot.

03:15.490 --> 03:16.980
I think she needs more help
than we can give her.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.227
You think she's wrong
about your employer, Gruner.

03:20.260 --> 03:21.818
Of course she's wrong.

03:21.860 --> 03:24.397
I reached out
to the Osweiler family

03:24.430 --> 03:26.432
shortly after you arrived.

03:27.370 --> 03:28.928
As it turns out,

03:28.970 --> 03:30.938
they did change their
insurance company last year.

03:30.970 --> 03:33.530
Their names should have been
on the list he gave you.

03:33.580 --> 03:35.775
Wait a second,
are you seriously...?

03:35.810 --> 03:37.471
Knowing their address
would have allowed us

03:37.510 --> 03:38.772
to find Simon de Merville
much sooner.

03:38.810 --> 03:41.517
Perhaps even
before he was killed.

03:41.550 --> 03:43.415
You're upset, and so is Kitty,

03:43.450 --> 03:45.281
but if you think
that my new boss

03:45.320 --> 03:46.878
just happens to be the same guy

03:46.920 --> 03:48.717
who took her in London, I...

03:48.760 --> 03:50.728
I am simply raising
the possibility

03:50.760 --> 03:52.352
that nothing
about your relationship

03:52.400 --> 03:54.356
with Gruner "just happened."

03:54.400 --> 03:56.618
That you were targeted.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.797
During your
courtship with Leda,

03:58.830 --> 04:00.639
there were multiple interviews,

04:00.670 --> 04:02.501
multiple background checks,
were there not?

04:03.810 --> 04:06.335
Would have been a very useful
way to gather intelligence.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.404
On what?

04:07.440 --> 04:10.045
Kitty. Me. You.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.945
Imagine you're him.

04:11.980 --> 04:15.347
Five years ago, you took
and tortured an innocent girl.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.348
She escaped.

04:17.390 --> 04:19.358
You don't know
how much she knows

04:19.390 --> 04:21.358
or what she was able
to tell the police.

04:21.390 --> 04:24.882
The only thing that you know
is that you were never caught.

04:24.930 --> 04:26.898
Now, luclq for you,
you're very wealthy.

04:26.930 --> 04:28.488
You can look for her.

04:28.530 --> 04:30.327
You can keep tabs.

04:30.370 --> 04:32.338
What might you think
when you realize

04:32.370 --> 04:34.668
she has taken up
with a renowned detective?

04:34.700 --> 04:36.463
Oh, so this is all about you.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.331
Us.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.530
He realized we were
educating her, shaping her.

04:41.580 --> 04:43.343
How long might it be

04:43.380 --> 04:45.575
before we turned _
our collective attention to him?

04:46.880 --> 04:48.848
Now, there's
strength in numbers.

04:48.880 --> 04:51.849
Killing one of us might
incite the other two.

04:51.890 --> 04:55.849
But giving us an answer
he believed that we sought,

04:55.890 --> 04:57.687
giving us a culprit...

04:57.730 --> 04:59.994
Del framed De Merville?

05:00.030 --> 05:04.069
We don't know why De Merville's
partner attacked him.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.466
Perhaps he was paid to do it.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.468
What if he left
the phone at the bar

05:08.500 --> 05:10.434
that Melanie Vilkas
disappeared from?

05:10.470 --> 05:11.801
She was killed
to make it look

05:11.840 --> 05:13.569
like Kitty's attacker
was in New York.

05:13.610 --> 05:16.738
De Merville would have been
killed to put the matter to bed.

05:16.780 --> 05:20.614
So how, in this scenario,
does Del know the partner?

05:20.650 --> 05:23.016
"In this scenario,"
he's a man of means

05:23.050 --> 05:25.439
and a pervert
of the highest order.

05:25.490 --> 05:26.855
Is it really so hard to imagine

05:26.890 --> 05:28.619
he made friends
with a sex trafficker?

05:28.660 --> 05:30.389
Say you're right.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.022
Say the Osweilers' names did
pop up on the list

05:32.060 --> 05:33.527
that he got from the IRB.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.448
He would have only
taken them off if he knew

05:35.500 --> 05:37.923
the police were looking for
De Merville in Gerritsen Beach.

05:37.970 --> 05:39.699
He needed time to get
to the Osweiler residence

05:39.740 --> 05:41.537
to murder the man himself.

05:41.570 --> 05:43.538
WATSON: We only knew Gerritsen
Beach was significant

05:43.570 --> 05:46.107
because we traced the call that
De Merville made to his sister.

05:46.140 --> 05:47.698
I never told Del about that.

05:47.740 --> 05:49.708
You ever let anyone
at Leda handle your phone?

05:49.750 --> 05:52.719
No.

05:52.750 --> 05:55.810
They gave me
a company phone, though.

05:55.850 --> 05:58.080
(cell phone rings)

06:02.990 --> 06:04.958
Hello.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.821
Joan, it's Del.

06:07.830 --> 06:09.798
I'm gonna have to let you go.

06:09.830 --> 06:11.468
Too much has gone on this week.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.092
It's too bad, really.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.459
For a while there, you were

06:14.500 --> 06:16.502
a great help.

06:31.690 --> 06:33.658
GREGSON:
Del Gruner?

06:33.690 --> 06:35.658
Captain Gregson.

06:35.690 --> 06:37.453
We'd like to ask you
some questions.

06:39.730 --> 06:41.027
No, I'm sorry.

06:41.060 --> 06:42.493
I've never seen
this man before.

06:42.530 --> 06:43.861
His name was
Ervin Bogdani.

06:43.900 --> 06:47.461
He was a sex trafficker
for the Albanian mafia.

06:47.500 --> 06:50.708
He made an attempt on the life
of this man a few days ago.

06:50.740 --> 06:52.708
Recognize him?

06:52.740 --> 06:55.208
I think I do-- he was
in the news this week, right?

06:55.240 --> 06:58.038
He, um, he killed a girl,
left her on a pier.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.674
Captain, are you approaching
anything resembling a point?

07:00.720 --> 07:02.779
GREGSON: Your client is a person
of interest in the murder

07:02.820 --> 07:05.186
of the person he
just mentioned--

07:05.220 --> 07:06.187
Melanie Vilkas.

07:06.220 --> 07:08.586
I watch the news, too.

07:08.620 --> 07:10.588
This is the man
who killed her.

07:10.630 --> 07:13.224
Actually, we're not
so sure about that.

07:13.260 --> 07:15.228
Can we cut to the chase?

07:15.260 --> 07:17.865
The two of you are close
with Joan Watson.

07:17.900 --> 07:19.663
Mr. Gruner fired her
last night.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.839
Now he's a suspect
in a murder case

07:21.870 --> 07:23.167
that's already
been solved.
It's okay, Jim.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.007
I don't mind answering
a few questions.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.008
It's our understanding
that you spent some time

07:27.040 --> 07:28.598
in London five years ago.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.039
We'd acquired a British company.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.672
I was there
for about six months.

07:31.710 --> 07:34.679
During those six months,
another girl was taken.

07:34.720 --> 07:38.508
She was raped, beaten, branded,
just like Melanie.

07:38.550 --> 07:40.586
Only, this girl escaped.

07:40.620 --> 07:42.759
GREGSON: She thought she broke a
few of her attacker's fingers

07:42.790 --> 07:44.519
before she got away.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.926
You broke your right ring
and middle fingers.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.848
I can tell.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.094
They didn't heal right.

07:50.130 --> 07:52.098
Yeah, remember when boxing
was the new jogging?

07:52.130 --> 07:55.167
Well, I, uh, I took on
a heavy bag and lost.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.805
I'm sorry,
but 1-1 have to ask.

07:57.840 --> 08:01.037
I-Is this other girl
named Kitty?

08:01.080 --> 08:03.674
Joan mentioned
her a few times.

08:03.710 --> 08:04.904
Uh... I know

08:04.950 --> 08:06.178
she_su_rvived an attack
Similar to the one

08:06.210 --> 08:06.972
that you're describing.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.614
We're not at liberty
to discuss that.

08:09.650 --> 08:11.242
We're clone here.
Jim...

08:11.290 --> 08:14.259
I'm sorry if your consultant
had her feelings hurt.

08:14.290 --> 08:17.259
But Mr. Gruner is the face
of Leda Insurance.

08:17.290 --> 08:18.985
He works with several
prominent charities.

08:19.030 --> 08:20.998
He's given millions of dollars
and hundreds of hours

08:21.030 --> 08:23.191
of his time, and he was
also a major contributor

08:23.230 --> 08:25.266
to the mayor's last
election campaign.

08:25.300 --> 08:26.858
So unless you want
to explain to Hizzoner

08:26.900 --> 08:28.936
why Del Gruner is suing
the New York Police Department,

08:28.970 --> 08:30.938
I suggest you let
this matter drop.

08:30.970 --> 08:32.733
Gentlemen.

08:37.780 --> 08:39.577
It was all over
his face.

08:41.180 --> 08:42.738
GREGSON:
I know.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.746
BELL: Guy's got us
right where he wants us.

08:44.790 --> 08:47.759
Firing you makes this all
look retaliatory.

08:47.790 --> 08:49.758
Kitty never saw his face,

08:49.790 --> 08:52.281
and her rape kit in London
didn't turn up any viable DNA.

08:52.330 --> 08:54.150
And all the evidence
here in New York points

08:54.200 --> 08:55.599
to Simon de Merville.

08:55.630 --> 08:56.995
I'm not gonna
make it easy

08:57.030 --> 08:58.588
for him to sue
the department.

08:58.630 --> 08:59.995
I'll take a leave
of absence.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.029
Screw that.

09:01.070 --> 09:02.935
We do this, we do it together.

09:02.970 --> 09:04.005
(elevator bell dings)

09:09.850 --> 09:12.842
MAN: This is a 55-year-old male
with weight gain and edema

09:12.880 --> 09:14.768
as well as a history
of hypothyroidism.

09:14.820 --> 09:16.788
(knocking on door)

09:16.820 --> 09:18.617
HOLMES: Kitty Winter?
Hypothyroidism is secondary

09:18.650 --> 09:21.050
to radioactive iodine
for Graves disease many years...

09:21.090 --> 09:22.785
My name's
Sherlock Holmes.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.786
We met yesterday
after a fashion.

09:24.830 --> 09:26.058
You were blocking my
way at Scotland Yard.

09:26.090 --> 09:27.250
I've brought
your tablet back.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.268
How did you get this address?

09:30.300 --> 09:32.063
DCI Hopkins.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.933
He oversees the inspector
you've been harassing-- Davies.

09:34.970 --> 09:37.859
I haven't been harassing anyone.
Yes, you have.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.969
But with good reason--
Davies is a good man,

09:40.010 --> 09:42.171
but he's a limited thinker
and he requires harassment.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.648
Are you a policeman?

09:45.680 --> 09:48.012
No, certainly not.
I'm a consultant.

09:48.050 --> 09:49.847
I'm currently in the employ
of another department,

09:49.890 --> 09:53.155
but I make myself available
to the police when needed.

09:53.190 --> 09:56.626
You make your wage as
a transcriptionist, do you not?

09:56.660 --> 09:59.788
Sounds like
lonely work.

09:59.830 --> 10:02.867
Anyway, I read your report,
and I think you're right.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.265
Latif Malak was not taken
from that alleyway,

10:04.300 --> 10:05.699
he was taken
from somewhere else.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.936
I would very much like
to discuss

10:06.970 --> 10:08.267
the subject with you further,

10:08.300 --> 10:11.303
but preferably not
through a door.

10:11.340 --> 10:13.808
You can keep your knife
pointed at me if you like.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.808
How, how did you...
My sense

10:15.840 --> 10:18.741
from inquiring about you is
that I'm your last and best hope

10:18.780 --> 10:22.887
of finding Latif and bringing
his abductor to justice.

10:25.020 --> 10:26.908
Do you wish my help or not?

10:30.160 --> 10:32.151
(door unlocking)

10:50.250 --> 10:53.139
How are you feeling?

10:53.180 --> 10:54.977
Better. Thank you.

10:55.020 --> 10:56.044
I've eaten already.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.718
These are for you.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.388
I'm not really hungry.

10:59.420 --> 11:01.957
These are for you.

11:01.990 --> 11:03.924
Where's Watson?

11:03.960 --> 11:05.928
She's assisting Captain Gregson
and Detective Bell

11:05.960 --> 11:09.691
with a more thorough
investigation of Del Gruner.

11:09.730 --> 11:12.096
Did you know that "Del" is
short for "Adelbert"?

11:13.500 --> 11:15.365
Small wonder
the man is a sadist.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.078
Shouldn't you be with her?

11:20.110 --> 11:22.135
My place is here with you.

11:22.180 --> 11:24.068
Sherlock...

11:24.110 --> 11:25.998
I'm ashamed of myself.
I allowed you to leave

11:26.050 --> 11:27.119
the morgue
unaccompanied yesterday.

11:27.150 --> 11:28.708
You thought the man who hurt you

11:28.750 --> 11:30.308
was still at large,
and I thought...

11:30.350 --> 11:32.045
(low grunt)

11:32.090 --> 11:34.183
I should've been there.

11:34.220 --> 11:36.279
When you realized who he was.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.328
I'm leaving.

11:40.360 --> 11:42.055
(sniffs)

11:44.330 --> 11:47.163
A few days ago...

11:47.200 --> 11:50.067
you recommended
that I go back to London,

11:50.110 --> 11:51.998
and I should've listened to you.

11:54.010 --> 11:56.899
I wasn't ready
for this, Sherlock.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.168
It's all been
worked out with my mum.

11:59.210 --> 12:00.370
There's a ticket for me at JFK.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.240
I leave at noon.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.088
Ijust...

12:08.120 --> 12:11.021
wanted you to know
that I'm sorry.

12:12.560 --> 12:15.950
For going after
De Merville's sister.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.888
The captain was
right to sack me.

12:17.930 --> 12:20.160
You've been suspended.
There is a difference.

12:22.140 --> 12:24.904
I know now that I can't...

12:24.940 --> 12:27.807
help you.

12:27.840 --> 12:30.047
I'll just distract.

12:31.810 --> 12:33.846
I'll arrange for the police

12:33.880 --> 12:36.940
to take you to the airport.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.148
WATSON:
Hello?

12:47.200 --> 12:49.156
So, it took a lot of visits

12:49.200 --> 12:51.259
to a lot of unsavory places,

12:51.300 --> 12:53.063
but Marcus and I were able
to confirm that no one

12:53.100 --> 12:55.489
from the Albanian mob ordered
a hit on Simon de Merville.

12:55.540 --> 12:56.837
This lends credence

12:56.870 --> 12:58.303
to the idea that Ervin Bogdani

12:58.340 --> 13:00.399
was taking orders
from someone else

13:00.440 --> 13:01.839
when he came at De Merville
with a knife

13:01.880 --> 13:03.177
the other day.
Only there's

13:03.210 --> 13:05.178
no proof to connect
Bogdani to Del.

13:05.210 --> 13:06.370
Stop calling him that, please.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.344
Del?
Del. Del is the man

13:08.380 --> 13:10.041
who hired you.
A friendly face, a facade.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.012
We seek Gruner!

13:12.050 --> 13:14.154
So, what's all this?

13:14.190 --> 13:16.078
Patrons from_ the bar that
Melanie Vilkas disappeared from

13:16.120 --> 13:19.897
recalled seeing Ervin Bogdani
the night of the crime.

13:19.930 --> 13:22.023
He is in all likelihood
the man who took her.

13:22.060 --> 13:24.494
Her murder, on the
other hand, was the work

13:24.530 --> 13:27.135
of the same man
who took Kitty-- Gruner.

13:27.170 --> 13:29.388
Take a look
at the autopsy report.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.499
He revels in his work
and who he is.

13:31.540 --> 13:34.031
I think it's highly unlikely
that he limited himself

13:34.080 --> 13:37.572
to just Kitty and Melanie Vilkas
over the last five years.

13:37.610 --> 13:40.340
But you and Kitty were never
able to identify other victims.

13:40.380 --> 13:43.110
Women with brands
on their backs.

13:43.150 --> 13:45.141
Gruner is a habitual murderer,
it stands to reason

13:45.190 --> 13:47.385
he is also practiced in the art
of disposing of bodies.

13:47.420 --> 13:49.149
He may be so practiced

13:49.190 --> 13:51.226
that no other victims
have ever turned up.

13:51.260 --> 13:53.148
Or they have,
but his various signatures

13:53.200 --> 13:55.054
were deliberately destroyed.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.897
Well, Melanie Vilkas' body
turned up.

13:56.930 --> 13:58.420
He wanted us to find her.

13:58.470 --> 14:01.394
We must identify the victims
he did not wish us to find.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.159
Within these boxes
lie open cases.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.633
Women who were taken and/or
murdered in the New York area

14:06.670 --> 14:09.138
over the last ten years.

14:09.180 --> 14:10.977
Their abductors and
their killers were

14:11.010 --> 14:12.307
never identified.
I will wager at least

14:12.350 --> 14:14.147
some of them
fell victim to Gruner.

14:14.180 --> 14:16.444
If we can cobble together
even a theoretical victim pool,

14:16.480 --> 14:19.210
we may find evidence,
which will undo him.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.616
In other words, we're looking
for a needle in a haystack.

14:21.660 --> 14:24.584
Needles. But yes,
our night will be long.

14:25.660 --> 14:28.128
(sighs)

14:36.100 --> 14:39.137
Did Kitty get to the
airport all right?

14:39.170 --> 14:42.947
She should be arriving
in London shortly.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.311
I wanted to apologize.

14:51.250 --> 14:53.354
You were right about everything.

14:53.390 --> 14:56.518
He lied to me.

14:56.560 --> 15:00.189
It's my fault that
Kitty had to leave.

15:00.230 --> 15:03.267
You were manipulated
by a brilliant psychopath

15:03.300 --> 15:07.066
for whom lying is as autonomic
a process as breathing.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.229
Join the club.

15:10.270 --> 15:12.067
(cell phone dings)

15:13.310 --> 15:15.107
It's Kitty.

15:15.140 --> 15:17.540
She just landed.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.674
*

15:59.750 --> 16:01.513
(gasps)

16:01.560 --> 16:04.586
(groans)

16:04.630 --> 16:07.098
Well, looks like
you made some progress.

16:07.130 --> 16:08.427
After you fell asleep,

16:08.460 --> 16:09.757
I continued going
through the files.

16:09.800 --> 16:10.994
These are the women

16:11.030 --> 16:12.622
who fell into the widest net.

16:12.670 --> 16:14.137
Women who match Kitty's

16:14.170 --> 16:16.195
and Melanie Vilkas'
general appearance

16:16.240 --> 16:19.334
and age, but whose remains
were either never found or

16:19.370 --> 16:21.179
found in such condition
as to potentially obscure

16:21.210 --> 16:23.576
the scarring
from Gruner's brand.

16:23.610 --> 16:26.408
From there, I looked
at the details of each case.

16:26.450 --> 16:28.042
In some, the abductions
did not match

16:28.080 --> 16:29.775
what we believe
to be Gruner's M.O.

16:29.820 --> 16:32.141
The drugging
and stealing away of women.

16:32.190 --> 16:34.010
Others occurred at times
that we can confirm

16:34.060 --> 16:36.119
he was out of the country.

16:36.160 --> 16:38.048
In this way, I've managed
to narrow our search

16:38.090 --> 16:41.594
down to... _
three potential candidates.

16:41.630 --> 16:44.167
Okay, well, like you said last
night, this is all theoretical.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.191
You're basing this all
on Kitty and Melanie Vilkas.

16:46.230 --> 16:48.664
And considering Gruner left
Melanie's body for us to find,

16:48.700 --> 16:52.101
I mean, she could be as false
a lead as Simon de Merville.

16:52.140 --> 16:54.176
It's unlikely the rest
of what Gruner did

16:54.210 --> 16:56.371
to Melanie Vilkas was faked.

16:56.410 --> 16:58.469
A deranged person can
no more choose

16:58.510 --> 17:00.614
their sexual proclivities
than a healthy one.

17:00.650 --> 17:02.447
I'm hoping he made
some strategic error.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.244
Giving away more information
than he intended.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.679
Oh.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.449
What about her? Francine Bianco?
She kind of looks like his type.

17:09.490 --> 17:11.219
And whoever killed
her burned her body.

17:11.260 --> 17:13.558
It could've been Gruner trying
to hide the brand marks.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.227
Why didn't she make the list?

17:15.260 --> 17:16.454
Ms. Bianco was held
by her captor

17:16.500 --> 17:18.058
for almost one year.

17:18.100 --> 17:19.192
Neither Melanie Vilkas

17:19.230 --> 17:20.697
nor any of our three
suspected matches

17:20.740 --> 17:22.139
were held for more
than a month.

17:22.170 --> 17:24.263
Was that really enough
to discount her?

17:24.310 --> 17:25.607
I'm sorry, did you
come up with a better

17:25.640 --> 17:27.107
process of elimination
in your sleep?

17:27.140 --> 17:28.232
You told me to take a break.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.145
These are our strongest leads.

17:30.180 --> 17:31.647
Might Francine Bianco
join their number eventually?

17:31.680 --> 17:33.409
Yes, of course she might.

17:33.450 --> 17:35.213
Gruner might have killed all of
these women or he might have

17:35.250 --> 17:38.139
killed none of them.
I have to start somewhere.

17:38.190 --> 17:41.785
(phone rings)

17:41.820 --> 17:44.220
Detective, you have
myself and Watson.

17:44.260 --> 17:46.148
BELL: _
Hey, I've been turning over
rocks in Gruner's life

17:46.190 --> 17:49.091
and a name jumped out
at me: Tabitha Laird.

17:49.130 --> 17:51.098
Is that someone you
think he killed?

17:51.130 --> 17:53.166
I think it's somebody
he may have wanted to kill.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.599
Tabitha Laird is alive.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.404
I'm on my way
to talk to her right now.

17:57.440 --> 18:00.409
I'm sorry.
Just give me a second, okay?

18:00.440 --> 18:02.635
Hey, hon?

18:02.680 --> 18:05.274
You color Mommy
something nice, okay?

18:12.450 --> 18:14.554
I think there
must be some confusion.

18:14.590 --> 18:17.184
_ I never filed _
a police complaint against Del.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.255
No, Ms. Laird, we know that.
But you work for a charity

18:19.290 --> 18:21.224
for foster kids, right?

18:21.260 --> 18:22.488
Hearth and Home
Foundaﬂon?
That's right.

18:22.530 --> 18:24.122
Del is on the board.

18:24.170 --> 18:25.899
Couple years ago you had
a conversation about him

18:25.930 --> 18:28.262
with another board member.
We wanted to ask you about it.

18:28.300 --> 18:31.269
You talked to Bonnie Kemp.

18:31.310 --> 18:32.834
That was all a mistake.

18:32.870 --> 18:34.337
Del and I are friends now.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.439
She gave the impression
that, at the time,

18:36.480 --> 18:38.300
you thought it was harassment.

18:38.350 --> 18:40.773
Del had just
joined the foundation.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.879
Part of my job was
to get him situated.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.241
There were a couple of...
incidents.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.780
Incidents?

18:46.820 --> 18:48.856
He invited me
to his beach house.

18:48.890 --> 18:50.858
He said I could bring
Jesse and we should

18:50.890 --> 18:52.357
bring our bathing suits.

18:52.390 --> 18:54.722
A few weeks later
he asked again.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.421
I mentioned it to Bonnie
and he apologized

18:56.460 --> 18:58.325
and backed off
the very next day.

18:58.370 --> 19:01.237
It's nothing against him.
He just wasn't my type.

19:01.270 --> 19:04.433
Type is important,
especially to a man like Gruner.

19:04.470 --> 19:07.303
Whatever it is
that you think Del did,

19:07.340 --> 19:08.432
you're wrong.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.345
He's a sweet guy.

19:10.380 --> 19:11.642
He's been very good to me.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.944
Good? How?
Well, in addition

19:13.980 --> 19:15.811
to his work with
the Hearth and Home Foundation,

19:15.850 --> 19:17.488
he funds a scholarship
at a private school

19:17.520 --> 19:19.385
in the city.
Jesse was the recipient

19:19.420 --> 19:21.251
two years ago.

19:21.290 --> 19:24.782
Without Del, I don't know
where I'd be today.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.799
Well, what do you think?

19:27.830 --> 19:30.367
I think she doesn't fit
our victim profile.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.698
She's older than the others.
She's taller, fair-haired.

19:32.730 --> 19:33.958
The most striking
difference, of course,

19:34.000 --> 19:35.661
is that she's still alive.

19:35.700 --> 19:38.260
_ If Gruner wasn't _
stalking her, what was he d0ing?

19:38.310 --> 19:40.574
Like many serial killers,
Gruner's a narcissist.

19:40.610 --> 19:43.374
He saw Tabitha Laird and her son
and he saw an opportunity

19:43.410 --> 19:45.640
to bask in the glory
of his own good deeds.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.648
He doesn't contribute to
charities or fund scholarships

19:47.680 --> 19:49.648
because he's a good person;
he does it 'cause he likes

19:49.680 --> 19:51.841
the attention that he gets.
You said you were looking

19:51.890 --> 19:54.450
into other areas of his life.
I say we cut our losses,

19:54.490 --> 19:55.855
compare whatever else
you've learned with our list

19:55.890 --> 19:57.482
of potential victims, and then

19:57.530 --> 20:00.658
_ see if we can
find a connection.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.589
You gonna tell me why
you asked me to meet you here,

20:03.630 --> 20:05.621
or do I have to guess?

20:08.700 --> 20:11.828
Latif.
He came here straight
from the hospital.

20:11.870 --> 20:15.374
You were wrong about
the pederast Hodge.

20:15.410 --> 20:18.675
The boy's true abductor was
a woman named Baraa Nezain.

20:18.710 --> 20:20.371
Until a few hours
ago, she resided

20:20.420 --> 20:22.945
in the same building
as the Malak family.

20:22.980 --> 20:26.609
She lost her own son
to leukemia in 2012.

20:26.650 --> 20:28.686
Latif was to be the replacement.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.779
She lured him to her
flat, she drugged him,

20:30.830 --> 20:33.321
and she hid him there.
Then she put his backpack

20:33.360 --> 20:35.624
in that alleyway to mislead
the police as to when and where

20:35.660 --> 20:38.663
he was taken_. Just
as you predicted.

20:40.970 --> 20:42.437
He's going
home tonight.

20:42.470 --> 20:43.960
'Cause of you.

20:46.570 --> 20:49.368
No, I thought it was Hodge.
I was positive.

20:49.410 --> 20:51.344
You wished it
to be Hodge.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.642
That's understandable.

20:52.680 --> 20:54.409
You were drawn to this
case because you also

20:54.450 --> 20:56.338
fell victim to a
sexual predator.

20:58.390 --> 21:00.415
I'm sorry. I've known
since our second meeting.

21:00.460 --> 21:03.725
If you are to hone your
skills as an investigator,

21:03.760 --> 21:06.524
you really must know
your blind spots.

21:08.530 --> 21:10.361
How did you take
everything that I told you

21:10.400 --> 21:11.992
and come up with this?

21:12.030 --> 21:14.999
All in good time, Ms. Winter.

21:15.040 --> 21:18.464
Firstly, I've got an offer
I'd like you to consider.

21:27.780 --> 21:29.771
*

21:48.640 --> 21:50.858
(sizzling)

21:57.450 --> 21:59.406
Thanks to all of you,

21:59.450 --> 22:03.739
we were able to find good homes
for more kids in 2014

22:03.790 --> 22:06.543
than in any prior year
of our history.

22:10.560 --> 22:13.529
To talk about what lies ahead,
here is a man

22:13.560 --> 22:16.996
whose generosity
with his money and his time

22:17.030 --> 22:21.467
truly embodies the spirit
of Hearth and Home.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.502
Del Gruner.

22:23.540 --> 22:25.838
Thank you, Warren.
Thank you.

22:30.850 --> 22:34.377
So, this rich guy dies,
and he finds himself

22:34.420 --> 22:37.583
in front of St. Peter
at the Pearly Gates...

22:40.860 --> 22:43.579
I had no idea you were involved
with the foundation.

22:43.630 --> 22:44.779
I wasn't.

22:44.830 --> 22:46.559
But then I saw you'd
be here tonight,

22:46.590 --> 22:47.955
and all of a sudden,
I knew how I wanted to spend

22:48.000 --> 22:49.922
my severance
check from Leda.

22:49.960 --> 22:53.566
Hmm. Well, if you're planning
on making a scene, be my guest.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.136
Just don't expect it
to do any good.

22:56.970 --> 22:59.962
It'll only take a few seconds
for you to be removed.

23:00.010 --> 23:01.898
I'm not here
to make a scene, Del.

23:01.940 --> 23:04.408
I just wanted to tell you
to enjoy it all while it lasts.

23:04.450 --> 23:06.873
(chuckles) And what makes you
think it's not going to last?

23:06.910 --> 23:09.413
Carrie Morse, Stacey Goff,

23:09.450 --> 23:11.680
Vivian Russell--
we know about them.

23:11.720 --> 23:12.982
It's only a matter of time
before we

23:13.960 --> 23:15.484
I'm sorry.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.078
None of those names
ring a bell. Should they?

23:17.120 --> 23:18.451
TABITHA:
Miss Watson.

23:18.490 --> 23:20.754
What are you doing here?

23:20.800 --> 23:22.893
Ms. Laird. Well, Del and I
used to work together.

23:22.930 --> 23:25.125
I saw the foundation_was
hosting an event tonight,

23:25.170 --> 23:26.899
and I thought I'd come
and say hello.

23:26.930 --> 23:28.966
How do you know Joan?
Oh, my colleagues and I

23:29.000 --> 23:30.638
paid her a visit today.

23:30.670 --> 23:32.137
We had a very interesting
conversation.

23:32.170 --> 23:33.603
Actually, we didn't.

23:33.640 --> 23:36.108
Um, they thought you
and I had a problem.

23:36.140 --> 23:38.449
I told them they
couldn't be more wrong.

23:38.480 --> 23:40.471
I was just coming to let you
know the silent auction

23:40.520 --> 23:41.976
is wrapping up, so...

23:42.020 --> 23:43.715
Oh, I was
just leaving.

23:43.750 --> 23:46.810
I wouldn't bid on any vacations
if I were you.

23:52.190 --> 23:55.523
(gasps) _
Let's say I'm anything
like you think I am.

23:55.560 --> 23:59.667
How smart would that make you,
testing me like this?

23:59.700 --> 24:00.997
You should be careful, Del.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.667
We're not in some basement.

24:02.700 --> 24:04.759
I don't have duct tape
around my eyes and wrists.

24:04.810 --> 24:06.562
Let go.

24:06.610 --> 24:07.872
Or we'll find
out how you do

24:07.910 --> 24:10.674
against a woman who can
actually fight back.

24:23.530 --> 24:24.519
WATSON:
I did a 12-week psych rotation,

24:24.560 --> 24:25.720
and I still couldn't tell you

24:25.760 --> 24:27.057
how someone could stand
in the middle

24:27.090 --> 24:28.489
of a charity benefit,
be accused of

24:28.530 --> 24:29.519
a string of murders
and tell jokes.

24:29.560 --> 24:30.697
I'm just as
baffled by you.

24:30.730 --> 24:31.992
You just gave
our adversary

24:32.030 --> 24:33.736
the names we were able
to diVine.

24:33.770 --> 24:35.829
If those women
were indeed his victims,

24:35.870 --> 24:37.838
now he knows our plan.
He can interfere.

24:37.870 --> 24:40.134
We are playing a guessing game.
You know that as well as I do.

24:40.170 --> 24:42.638
I do not guess!
You know what I mean.

24:42.680 --> 24:44.500
Having these women's pictures,
the dates and times

24:44.550 --> 24:46.575
they disappeared-- it's not
the same as physical evidence.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.874
We don't have bodies to autopsy,
crime scenes to visit.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.979
It is a poor detective
who blames her evidence, Watson.

24:51.020 --> 24:52.214
I wanted to see his face.

24:52.250 --> 24:53.683
I wanted to say
those three names

24:53.720 --> 24:55.051
and see what he did.

24:55.090 --> 24:57.524
And?

24:57.560 --> 24:59.152
Nothing.

24:59.190 --> 25:01.556
Yeah, well, that doesn't
mean we're not right.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.727
I did not come here
to scrap the list, okay?

25:03.770 --> 25:05.829
I came here because
I think it is incomplete.

25:05.870 --> 25:08.839
There was one name that did
get a rise out of Gruner.

25:08.870 --> 25:10.633
Tabitha Laird.
She was there tonight.

25:10.670 --> 25:12.228
When he realized
we'd been to see her,

25:12.270 --> 25:13.669
he lost it.

25:13.710 --> 25:15.132
Define "lost it."

25:18.310 --> 25:21.040
I saw him tonight--
the real him.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.608
Tabitha Laird may not fall
into the victim profile

25:24.650 --> 25:26.641
that we cobbled together,
but I am telling you,

25:26.690 --> 25:28.681
he's got plans for her.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.821
Tabitha Laird could not
be more dissimilar

25:31.860 --> 25:34.727
to the three women we
were able to isolate.

25:36.330 --> 25:38.821
Perhaps his interest in her
is genuinely romantic.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.735
There have been serial killers
with wives, girlfriends.

25:40.770 --> 25:42.635
These men are outliers,
but they do exist.

25:42.670 --> 25:44.308
No, we know what Gruner
does to women.

25:44.340 --> 25:46.604
We know what he sees
when he looks at them.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.801
This thing with Tabitha, it's...

25:48.840 --> 25:51.001
I can't explain it,
but there was something there.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.268
Then the only thing
that we know for certain

25:53.310 --> 25:57.019
is that I've wasted a great deal
of time on victimology.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.709
We're going to get Kitty back.

26:04.660 --> 26:06.855
We're going to
take care of this.

26:06.890 --> 26:09.757
She'll come back, and you'll get
to finish what you started.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.597
You should call the captain,

26:14.640 --> 26:16.369
arrange for protective detail
for Tabitha Laird

26:16.400 --> 26:17.731
and her son.

26:17.770 --> 26:19.931
I will revisit
every file in every box.

26:19.970 --> 26:21.631
If she is in
play for Gruner,

26:21.680 --> 26:23.773
then we will need to
broaden our parameters.

26:23.810 --> 26:26.745
We will need women in their 40s,
taller women, women with...

26:29.780 --> 26:30.747
What is it?

26:33.250 --> 26:35.753
You said the director of
the Hearth and Home Foundation

26:35.790 --> 26:38.258
thanked Del Gruner for his six
years of serwce this evening,

26:38.290 --> 26:40.326
did you not?
Yes.

26:40.360 --> 26:42.897
Francine Bianco--
she was taken in April 2008.

26:42.930 --> 26:44.761
Her charred remains
were not found

26:44.800 --> 26:47.325
in a shallow grave
until March 2009.

26:47.370 --> 26:49.133
Right, but I thought
that was the problem.

26:49.170 --> 26:50.706
She was kept for almost a year,

26:50.740 --> 26:52.230
the other women kept
only a few weeks.

26:52.270 --> 26:54.738
What if he intended to only
keep her for a few weeks,

26:54.780 --> 26:56.930
but then her circumstances
changed?

26:56.980 --> 26:59.244
What kind of circumstances?

26:59.280 --> 27:00.816
I don't think Gruner
is interested

27:00.850 --> 27:02.317
in Tabitha Laird at all.

27:02.350 --> 27:04.887
I think he's interested
in her son.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.392
I can't do it.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.694
Oh, then you
can't come in.

27:27.370 --> 27:29.804
(sighs)

27:50.930 --> 27:53.398
*

28:11.490 --> 28:13.446
This method is the only way

28:13.490 --> 28:16.209
to bypass the chain on
a door such as this one.

28:16.260 --> 28:17.818
It is important
that you master it.

28:17.860 --> 28:19.828
Like it's important
that I study tobacco ash

28:19.860 --> 28:22.328
and can distinguish
one form of mold from another.

28:22.360 --> 28:24.123
Do you know
why most investigators fail?

28:24.170 --> 28:25.819
Lack of elastics?

28:25.870 --> 28:27.963
They refuse to extend
their base of knowledge

28:28.000 --> 28:30.468
beyond the bounds of basic
investigative procedure.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.036
Right, but we've been
doing this for weeks.

28:32.070 --> 28:34.129
When do we get
to take on an actual case?

28:34.180 --> 28:35.875
When I decide that you're ready.

28:35.910 --> 28:38.447
Do it again.

28:40.350 --> 28:42.511
You don't look well, you know.

28:42.550 --> 28:44.188
What's my appearance got
to do with anything?

28:44.220 --> 28:46.188
You've been mopey
ever since MI6 fired you.

28:46.220 --> 28:48.984
I think you're taking
your frustrations out on me.

28:49.020 --> 28:52.820
I am gifting you
with an education.

28:52.860 --> 28:54.851
Well, maybe you were just wrong
about me.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.856
Only that can't be it
because you're never wrong.

28:56.900 --> 28:59.494
Watson was much further along
at this point.

28:59.530 --> 29:03.762
Perhaps you're right
about me being wrong.

29:03.810 --> 29:04.959
I was only ever trying
to fix you,

29:05.010 --> 29:07.877
but you seem
to enjoy being broken.

29:11.280 --> 29:13.441
Don't call me again.

29:13.480 --> 29:15.311
Even

29:22.320 --> 29:23.924
Yes, Jesse is adopted.

29:23.960 --> 29:25.928
What does that have
to do with anything?

29:25.960 --> 29:29.020
Did you ever come in contact
with the biological parents?
No,

29:29.060 --> 29:31.369
he was a safe haven baby.
Someone left him at a firehouse.

29:31.400 --> 29:32.799
Why?

29:32.830 --> 29:34.195
We have_reason
to believe

29:34.240 --> 29:36.959
that Jesse's father
might be Del Gruner.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.833
What?
WATSON:
We think he abducted this woman,

29:39.870 --> 29:40.939
Francine Bianco, in 2008.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.971
We think she's

29:43.010 --> 29:45.308
_ J_esse's
biological mother.

29:45.350 --> 29:48.114
This is insane.

29:48.150 --> 29:49.811
Insane would be
a fair assessment.

29:49.850 --> 29:51.386
Mr. Gruner suffers from
what must surely be

29:51.420 --> 29:53.308
clinical narcissism.

29:53.350 --> 29:56.353
That is why, when he realized
he'd impregnated his captive,

29:56.390 --> 29:58.358
he veered from what we believe
to be his pattern.

29:58.390 --> 30:00.824
He, uh...
he'd created something,

30:00.860 --> 30:03.920
a life, and it was his, which
means it meant something to him.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.062
So he spared Ms. Bianco.

30:05.100 --> 30:07.159
At least until she came to term.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.838
That doesn't even make sense.

30:08.870 --> 30:11.862
Why would somebody do all that
just to give him up?

30:11.910 --> 30:14.970
Odds are he didn't know how to
explain suddenly having a child.
HOLMES: His appointment

30:15.010 --> 30:16.170
at the Hearth and
Home Foundation

30:16.210 --> 30:17.871
allowed him access

30:17.910 --> 30:20.879
and a means to, uh,
influence Jesse's life.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.548
He later funded a scholarship
for the same reason.

30:23.580 --> 30:25.548
I would like you to leave.

30:25.590 --> 30:27.956
WATSON:
Please. We know how
difficult this is to hear.

30:27.990 --> 30:29.958
We don't expect you
to take it on faith.

30:29.990 --> 30:32.857
We just want to swab
the inside of Jesse's cheek.

30:32.890 --> 30:35.222
If we're wrong and his DNA
does not match Francine's,

30:35.260 --> 30:36.921
we'll know
within a few hours.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.167
If we're right,
believe us,

30:39.200 --> 30:41.964
you don't want Jesse's
father walking free.

30:46.910 --> 30:49.572
There's no luggage in the house.

30:49.610 --> 30:51.874
Half his clothes are missing.

30:51.910 --> 30:54.879
Del Gruner is not out
buying Cigarettes.

30:54.920 --> 30:57.013
Well, you think he
knew we were coming?

30:57.050 --> 31:01.009
Maybe Tabitha Laird
tipped him off.

31:01.060 --> 31:04.484
He vacated abruptly
a couple of hours ago.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.282
Well, we got
a BOLO out.

31:06.330 --> 31:08.195
Would be nice to monitor
his credit card activity,

31:08.230 --> 31:09.959
but the judge who gave us
the search warrant

31:10.000 --> 31:11.297
was being generous

31:11.330 --> 31:13.969
as it is.
Generous?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.434
Yeah, we got the DNA test
that shows that Jesse Laird

31:16.470 --> 31:20.065
is Francine Bianco's son.
We got Kitty's statements.

31:20.110 --> 31:21.998
Both raise
questions.

31:22.040 --> 31:24.201
But if we want to go hard
after this guy,

31:24.250 --> 31:26.969
we need to pull a solid answer
out of this place.

31:27.010 --> 31:30.377
Well, there has to be a usable
DNA sample in here somewhere.

31:30.420 --> 31:33.082
I've already sent a hairbrush
to the M.E.'s lab for testing.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.985
If Gruner's
the father,

31:35.020 --> 31:37.079
he's cooked--
assuming we can find him.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.326
Well, there must surely
be a clue here

31:38.360 --> 31:39.987
which will help in that regard.

31:40.030 --> 31:41.554
I'll take this floor, Watson,
you take upstairs.

31:52.740 --> 31:56.107
KITTY:
How do you know
when it's ready, Del?

32:01.020 --> 32:02.248
Del?

32:04.450 --> 32:07.044
Talk to
me, Del.

32:09.020 --> 32:11.329
You_ must not like
hearing your name

32:11.360 --> 32:13.999
in the mouth of the person
who's gonna kill you.

32:16.530 --> 32:19.966
I know I didn't.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.729
That's one of the
reasons I changed it.
It wasn't just

32:21.770 --> 32:24.068
so you wouldn't find me, it was
the way that you kept using it.

32:25.470 --> 32:28.701
You're going to die tonight,
quite horribly.

32:30.710 --> 32:32.746
Then I'm gonna dissolve you
in a sink.

32:32.780 --> 32:35.544
Wait!

32:39.190 --> 32:43.456
I just want you to know...

32:43.490 --> 32:47.119
that I never stopped
seeing your face.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.525
Not after that night.

32:48.560 --> 32:51.427
The other girls,

32:51.470 --> 32:55.031
the ones who didn't escape--

32:55.070 --> 32:57.061
well, I saw you.

32:58.170 --> 33:01.606
The bitch who
broke my hand.

33:01.640 --> 33:05.007
You think you went through hell.

33:06.710 --> 33:09.019
Oh, but they suffered more

33:09.050 --> 33:10.642
because of you!

33:12.790 --> 33:14.018
(knocking at door)

33:14.060 --> 33:16.119
Help!

33:16.160 --> 33:17.184
In here! Help!

33:17.220 --> 33:18.721
(grunts)

33:34.110 --> 33:35.099
HOLMES:
It's me.

33:35.140 --> 33:37.574
And it's only me.

33:39.250 --> 33:41.639
Open the door.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.759
I was here once,
you know.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.607
Not literally here,

34:04.640 --> 34:07.131
but where you are
with him.

34:07.170 --> 34:08.671
The man you thought
killed Irene.

34:08.710 --> 34:10.598
I couldn't go through with it.

34:10.640 --> 34:13.177
You had the wrong man,
I have the right one.

34:13.210 --> 34:14.438
Does my nose
deceive me,

34:14.480 --> 34:15.572
or have you laid hands

34:15.620 --> 34:17.349
on some nutmeg concoction?

34:20.450 --> 34:23.510
How did you find me?
Your phone.

34:25.830 --> 34:28.651
So you saw that I hadn't
gone back to London.

34:28.700 --> 34:31.396
I knew you weren't going
the second you told me.

34:32.470 --> 34:34.631
If you knew that I was lying...

34:34.670 --> 34:37.491
You were right the other day.
At the morgue.

34:37.540 --> 34:39.337
When you said
I couldn't possibly know

34:39.370 --> 34:40.564
what you're feeling.

34:42.740 --> 34:45.607
I thought, perhaps,
this was what you needed.

34:45.650 --> 34:47.447
It is.

34:47.480 --> 34:49.675
I was less certain.

34:49.720 --> 34:53.486
So I returned
to the business at hand.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.659
I thought if Watson and I
could bring Gruner to justice

34:55.690 --> 34:57.817
before you acted,
you would be spared the decision

34:57.860 --> 35:00.181
that you have to make
regarding his life.

35:00.230 --> 35:02.551
If, on the other hand,

35:02.600 --> 35:04.818
we could not undo Gruner...

35:07.270 --> 35:09.761
So, why are you here now?

35:11.570 --> 35:15.131
When I returned to London
last year,

35:15.180 --> 35:17.239
I had certain expectations.

35:17.280 --> 35:21.546
Exactly none
of them were met.

35:21.580 --> 35:24.378
Our crossing paths
changed things for me.

35:26.620 --> 35:29.418
You, um...

35:29.460 --> 35:32.452
saved me.

35:34.530 --> 35:37.624
I'd like to return the favor.

35:37.660 --> 35:40.265
This is a favor.

35:40.300 --> 35:41.790
Interfering.

35:43.770 --> 35:46.432
If you decide
that killing Gruner

35:46.470 --> 35:48.904
is going
to make you feel whole again,

35:48.940 --> 35:51.500
I won't stop you.

35:53.680 --> 35:56.444
But I'd be remiss
if I didn't tell you

35:56.480 --> 35:59.449
that we had found a way
to expose him.

35:59.490 --> 36:01.515
What does that have
to do with me?

36:01.560 --> 36:03.858
With what he did to me?

36:03.890 --> 36:06.450
Nothing.

36:06.490 --> 36:08.651
Everything.

36:08.700 --> 36:11.692
Wish I could tell you.

36:15.670 --> 36:18.230
Whatever you decide,

36:18.270 --> 36:20.534
you must understand

36:20.570 --> 36:23.698
that you will always be
special to me.

36:26.450 --> 36:29.669
You will always...

36:29.720 --> 36:32.314
be my friend.

36:58.780 --> 37:02.739
Tonight's your luclq night, Del.

37:06.920 --> 37:09.559
I'm not gonna
kill you after all.

37:12.760 --> 37:16.025
Everything I've shown
you tonight was just...

37:16.060 --> 37:18.267
a mask.

37:18.300 --> 37:20.723
It isn't really me.

37:23.700 --> 37:26.260
You'd know all about
masks, wouldn't you?

37:27.570 --> 37:30.539
You've worn _one
your entire life.

37:30.580 --> 37:33.572
(inhaling)

37:33.610 --> 37:35.840
I've taken mine off.

37:40.090 --> 37:42.718
Now it's your turn.

37:59.770 --> 38:02.603
(sighs)

38:02.640 --> 38:07.339
You want to tell me where
you've been the last few hours?

38:09.750 --> 38:11.945
No.

38:13.820 --> 38:16.380
Tell me she's okay.

38:20.760 --> 38:22.955
(phone ringing)

38:25.700 --> 38:28.021
Captain.

38:28.070 --> 38:30.664
GREGSON:
We got him. Gruner.

38:30.700 --> 38:33.339
We've been trying to ping
his cell phone for hours,

38:33.370 --> 38:35.770
but suddenly it
came back on.

38:35.810 --> 38:38.404
We found him in a
warehouse on Staten Island

38:38.450 --> 38:40.509
tied to a chair.

38:40.550 --> 38:43.678
At first, we thought someone
had ﬁt his head on fire,

38:43.720 --> 38:48.953
but the doctor said it was
some kind of corrosive.

38:48.990 --> 38:52.050
Preliminary lab work
says he is Jesse Laird's

38:52.090 --> 38:55.526
biological father,
and Joan found a book stashed

38:55.560 --> 38:56.993
at his place.
There are pictures

38:57.030 --> 39:00.727
in there that he's not_
gonna be able to explain.

39:00.770 --> 39:02.658
He's gonna wake up

39:02.700 --> 39:04.907
after a few hours,
and right after I tell him

39:04.940 --> 39:07.807
he's under arrest, I'm gonna
ask him who did this to him.

39:07.840 --> 39:11.503
Maybe it's a
name I know.

39:11.550 --> 39:13.677
Maybe it isn't.

39:13.710 --> 39:16.941
Either way, I'm gonna
have to go after them.

39:19.090 --> 39:21.684
Understood.

39:24.190 --> 39:26.829
(phone ringing)

39:32.730 --> 39:35.995
There's some things I need
to wrap up with the captain.

39:41.110 --> 39:42.907
KITTY:
I wanted you to know

39:42.940 --> 39:46.478
that this is the last time
I'll be using this phone.

39:46.510 --> 39:48.774
Thought you'd want to verify

39:48.820 --> 39:52.449
that I really have gone
to the airport this time.

39:52.490 --> 39:54.856
So you have.

39:57.060 --> 39:59.927
Do you think
I did the right thing?

39:59.960 --> 40:04.966
I think you do not have
the stain of a murder upon you.

40:09.600 --> 40:13.502
You say that I saved you,
but the way that I see it...

40:13.540 --> 40:16.134
you gave me everything.

40:18.850 --> 40:21.569
Have you decided
where you're going to go?

40:21.620 --> 40:24.487
Well, somewhere I can use
what you taught me,

40:24.520 --> 40:26.886
somewhere I can help people.

40:26.920 --> 40:30.117
I might reach out to you with
a question every now and again.

40:30.160 --> 40:32.481
I hope that's okay.

40:32.530 --> 40:35.897
I am at your disposal.

40:40.730 --> 40:44.439
Do you know what I haven't said
to anyone in a really long time?

40:46.940 --> 40:49.135
I love you.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.740
(crying): _
Isn't that the saddest thing?

40:51.780 --> 40:54.772
(breath quivers, sniffles)

40:59.190 --> 41:01.784
(fire crackling)

41:05.660 --> 41:07.855
(knocking)

41:09.200 --> 41:11.794
(sniffles)

41:15.570 --> 41:17.788
(sniffles)

41:21.270 --> 41:23.875
(sniffles)

41:27.010 --> 41:30.468
Did you, uh...
you, uh, forget something?

41:32.820 --> 41:36.153
I'm sorry for
leaving last week.

41:36.190 --> 41:38.750
It was a mistake.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.691
You started something with me,

41:44.730 --> 41:47.858
and I'd like you to finish it.

41:50.200 --> 41:53.260
Come back tomorrow
at midday...

41:53.310 --> 41:56.029
and bring some goggles.

41:56.080 --> 41:58.674
And a ladder.

42:03.620 --> 42:06.680
*

42:11.990 --> 42:14.595
(sighs)
