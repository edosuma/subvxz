00:17.582 --> 00:19.236
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:21.108 --> 00:22.718
- I just needed
to change my clothes,

00:22.761 --> 00:25.503
and then I was going
to buy a coffee.

00:25.547 --> 00:28.680
So rude, yelling,
"Bathroom for customers only,"

00:28.724 --> 00:31.118
the whole time I'm in there.

00:31.161 --> 00:33.424
Sorry, I didn't get you
a coffee, mami.

00:33.468 --> 00:35.165
- Coffee's not what I need
right now, T.

00:35.209 --> 00:36.166
- I know.

00:36.210 --> 00:38.690
I'll hook you up tonight, okay?

00:47.221 --> 00:49.092
- You look cold, bae.
I'll keep you warm.

00:49.136 --> 00:50.441
If you pay me.

00:50.485 --> 00:51.747
- Your mama's calling,
it's past your bedtime.

00:51.790 --> 00:54.619
The streets might eat you.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.621
Hang on, I just gotta
go grab my coat,

00:56.665 --> 00:58.667

okay?

00:58.710 --> 01:02.410
- Hey, watch your back, baby.

01:02.453 --> 01:04.803
It is heartless
out here tonight.

01:10.766 --> 01:11.854
- Hey, Daria.

01:11.897 --> 01:13.464
- I've been looking
all over for you.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.466
- Here I am.

01:15.510 --> 01:17.120
- I got you this.

01:18.252 --> 01:20.167
- Thanks.

01:23.474 --> 01:25.302
Got any cash?
I'll pay you back.

01:25.346 --> 01:26.782
It's not for me.
A friend needs it.

01:26.825 --> 01:29.437
- Please, don't.

01:29.480 --> 01:33.484
- Fine.
You hear anything from Mom?

01:33.528 --> 01:35.399
- You know how that goes.

01:35.443 --> 01:37.445
- She doesn't worry about us
at all, does she?

01:37.488 --> 01:40.535
- Well, I worry about you.
Sleeping in hallways?

01:40.578 --> 01:43.451
It's not safe.
Come back with me, please.

01:43.494 --> 01:44.713
- To your dorm?

01:44.756 --> 01:48.325
Nah. I don't belong there.

01:48.369 --> 01:50.327
You were always the smart one.

01:50.371 --> 01:52.590
You get back there,

- Love you.

- Hey, Country.

02:02.905 --> 02:05.821
Quit playing with your knives
and hold this for me.

02:05.864 --> 02:10.434
- You got it.
- Oh, and I need my coat.

02:10.478 --> 02:11.609
- You should eat
something first.

02:11.653 --> 02:14.656

- He'll wait.

02:35.677 --> 02:36.808
He raped me, Daria,

02:36.852 --> 02:38.941
and choked me
and tried to kill me.

02:40.725 --> 02:43.946
I want to come stay with you.
I'll be good, I promise.

02:43.989 --> 02:45.513
I'll get off the drugs.
I really want--

02:45.556 --> 02:47.602
no!

02:47.645 --> 02:51.432
- Scream all you want.
Nobody cares.

02:54.522 --> 02:56.001
- So how'd it go with McGrath?

02:56.045 --> 03:00.223
- He's being respectful
or pretending to be, for now.

03:00.267 --> 03:01.703
At least I don't have to
go over

03:01.746 --> 03:03.444
every one of my cases with him.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.315
- We'll see how long
that lasts.

03:05.359 --> 03:06.664
- I already told him
all of this before.

03:06.708 --> 03:07.970
- I understand.

03:08.013 --> 03:09.232
You don't understand,
my sister is missing.

03:09.276 --> 03:10.320
- So much for a quiet morning.

03:10.364 --> 03:11.669
- She said someone
tried to kill her.

03:11.713 --> 03:12.931
She's not picking up her phone.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.498
I called 911
and no one's listening to me.

03:14.542 --> 03:15.847
- Daria, I'm listening.
- So why are we standing here?

03:15.891 --> 03:17.545
- So what happened?
- I don't know.

03:17.588 --> 03:20.417
I was on patrol, East Harlem,
she jumped in front of the car,

03:20.461 --> 03:21.549
screaming something
about a rape.

03:21.592 --> 03:23.028
- Rollins, Velasco.

03:23.072 --> 03:24.726
- Hi, Captain.
This is Daria Cruz.

03:24.769 --> 03:26.423
She thinks her sister
may be in trouble.

03:26.467 --> 03:27.990
- Officer Tran here
brought her to SVU.

03:28.033 --> 03:29.513
- You did
the right thing, officer.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.167
- Thank you.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.777
- So you can tell your sergeant
that we've got it from here.

03:32.821 --> 03:34.257
Thank you so much.

03:34.301 --> 03:38.348
Okay, Daria, can I ask you

04:42.934 --> 04:44.371
- Last night I was studying.

04:44.414 --> 04:46.590
Usually when Tania calls,
she's asking for drug money.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.331

04:48.375 --> 04:49.550

your sister's number,

04:52.857 --> 04:54.598
- Last night, East Harlem.

04:54.642 --> 04:58.776
- So she lives near there?
- No, she hangs around there.

04:58.820 --> 05:01.997
She's homeless.
She's a survival sex worker.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.738
Our mom took off last spring

05:03.781 --> 05:07.263
and Tania started partying

05:07.307 --> 05:09.004
She's been on a bad spiral.

Do you know anyone
who she hangs out with?

05:14.488 --> 05:18.535
Maybe somebody who knows her
clients or knows her dealer?

that Tania was missing.

05:25.368 --> 05:28.328
Surprised to see NYPD cares.

05:28.371 --> 05:31.026

05:31.069 --> 05:32.549
- Any of these girls know her?

05:34.638 --> 05:36.727
- Snowflake and Missy.

05:36.771 --> 05:40.383
Ladies, these detectives
are looking for Tania.

05:40.427 --> 05:41.993
- I ain't seen her
since, like, forever.

05:42.037 --> 05:44.387
- Maybe she went away
with a date.

05:44.431 --> 05:45.562
We do that sometimes.

05:45.606 --> 05:46.998
- Okay, any particular client?

05:47.042 --> 05:49.740
Maybe a guy who gets rough.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.916
- Like half of these mothers?

05:51.960 --> 05:54.571
- Tania's sister thought
she was looking to score.

05:54.615 --> 05:55.877
You guys know her dealer?

05:55.920 --> 05:57.574
- No, you should
talk to Beauty.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.794
- Any idea where
we might find Beauty?

06:00.969 --> 06:02.666
- Maybe over on Pleasant.

06:05.756 --> 06:08.803
- Some days the whole world
smells like cat pee.

06:08.846 --> 06:11.066

worried about her.

06:11.109 --> 06:12.459
Anything that you can
think of--

06:12.502 --> 06:13.764
- Daria's always worried,

06:13.808 --> 06:15.897
but she can't do
a thing for her.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.421
Keeps coming down here
with snacks and Gatorade

06:18.465 --> 06:20.728
like T's on some kind
of Outward Bound trip.

06:20.771 --> 06:23.078
- I heard you two go on dates
together sometimes.

06:23.121 --> 06:24.427
Have you met anyone weird?

06:24.471 --> 06:26.603
- They're all weird.

06:26.647 --> 06:29.867
T's all right, though.
Taught her how to survive.

06:29.911 --> 06:32.653
Don't go with drunks,
they take too long.

06:32.696 --> 06:35.090
And stay away
from nerdy white guys,

06:35.133 --> 06:38.136
they're always the psychos.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.877
- When's the last time
you saw her?

06:39.921 --> 06:42.750
- Last night, early.

06:42.793 --> 06:45.448
She was headed over
to Country's to get her coat.

06:45.492 --> 06:46.797
She was gonna
meet me back here.

06:46.841 --> 06:49.409
- She never showed.
Did you text her?

06:49.452 --> 06:51.149
- Nah.

06:51.193 --> 06:52.716
Sometimes T starts flying,

06:52.760 --> 06:54.849
and then she's not
gonna land for a while.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.593
"Stay in heaven
long as you can."

06:59.636 --> 07:01.508
That's what I say.

07:04.119 --> 07:05.555
- Is Tania okay?

07:05.599 --> 07:07.470
- You see anybody out there
waiting on her,

07:07.514 --> 07:09.385
like a guy or a vehicle?

07:09.429 --> 07:11.082
- She got a rich daddy
or something?

07:11.126 --> 07:13.128
Look, it was busy last night.

07:13.171 --> 07:17.611
She came in, grabbed her coat,
and she left this.

07:19.177 --> 07:21.005
- And she gave you
that because?

07:21.049 --> 07:23.660
- They stash stuff with me
all the time.

07:23.704 --> 07:27.490
Umbrellas, cereal,
pictures of their mama.

07:27.534 --> 07:31.407
They got no place to stay,
no place to keep their things.

07:35.150 --> 07:37.500

the backpack I gave her.

07:37.544 --> 07:38.675
Where was it?

named Country.

07:40.721 --> 07:43.506
Did Tania ever talk
to you about him?

he looks out for her.

- Oh, good.

08:11.752 --> 08:13.710

in this hallway, keeping warm,

08:17.192 --> 08:18.541

Listen, we understand,

- Not without her bag.

08:34.165 --> 08:35.515
She left it with us

08:35.558 --> 08:37.255

her dealer searching it.

who the dealer is?

08:38.605 --> 08:39.693
- No idea.

She doesn't tell us stuff
like that.

were over 18.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.137
There's not much we can do.

11:00.181 --> 11:02.618
- And nobody went back to the
precinct looking for the girls.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.446
- So no investigation.

11:04.489 --> 11:06.056
- I mean, these women,
they could have been

11:06.100 --> 11:07.275
from out of state, gone home--

11:07.318 --> 11:09.320
- Or ended up in the morgue.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.282
- You asked me to look
for Jane Does matching

11:14.325 --> 11:15.587
the profile you gave me?

11:15.631 --> 11:18.155
- Yeah, dark-haired,
slight women,

11:18.199 --> 11:19.983
most likely sex workers.

11:20.027 --> 11:21.289

my Christmas angels.

11:30.167 --> 11:31.516
The second was maybe
a week later.

11:31.560 --> 11:35.259

- I estimate 18, 19.

11:35.303 --> 11:36.608
From their dentition,

11:36.652 --> 11:38.654
probably drug addicted
on the edge of society.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.308
No access to regular
dental care.

persons report

brought in DNA, not a match.

The second victim was partially
eviscerated post-mortem.

32:57.497 --> 33:01.022
white as a sheet,
flat and quiet, a dead fish.

33:01.066 --> 33:03.024
No way he did anything
to get himself arrested.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.678
- Do you know where he was
last Sunday?

33:04.721 --> 33:06.027
- He said he was going
to the city

33:06.071 --> 33:08.725
to meet a girlfriend,
but that's a lie.

33:08.769 --> 33:10.379
- Why is that, Mrs. Lambert?

33:10.423 --> 33:12.381
-
You take a look at him?

33:14.731 --> 33:17.038
- Mrs. Lambert,
I'm Captain Benson.

33:17.082 --> 33:18.431
How's everything going in here?

33:18.474 --> 33:19.736
- Can Trace and I go home now?

33:19.780 --> 33:21.564
- Mrs. Lambert
was just telling me

33:21.608 --> 33:22.696
Trace is not good with women.

33:22.739 --> 33:25.351
- What I said was,
he's a loser.

33:25.394 --> 33:28.484
This one, he's charming,
but he wasn't listening.

33:28.528 --> 33:32.532
- How about you tell me
about your son, Mrs. Lambert?

33:34.490 --> 33:36.666
- I don't know
why you'd be interested,

33:36.710 --> 33:38.625
but since you're asking.

33:40.279 --> 33:41.280
<i>- No, I don't know her,</i>

33:41.323 --> 33:42.542
I don't know her,
I don't know her.

33:42.585 --> 33:43.760
How many times
I gotta tell you,

33:43.804 --> 33:44.892
they're not my type.

33:44.935 --> 33:47.503
- And what is your type?
- Not that.

33:47.547 --> 33:48.722
Classier, I guess.

33:51.812 --> 33:55.250
- Trace, Captain Benson.

33:55.294 --> 33:57.687
- Trace was just telling us
what kind of women he likes.

33:57.731 --> 34:00.429
- I was just talking to your
mother about the same thing.

34:00.473 --> 34:01.517
- She doesn't know
anything about me.

34:01.561 --> 34:02.692
She shouldn't even be here.

34:02.736 --> 34:04.607
- Okay, you guys want
to take a break?

34:04.651 --> 34:05.608
- Yeah, Cap.

34:05.652 --> 34:06.696
- Okay.

34:12.398 --> 34:15.270
- Look, my mother's
a lonely old lady.

34:15.314 --> 34:16.402
She don't got anybody
to talk to.

34:16.445 --> 34:18.534
- Oh, I got that sense.

34:18.578 --> 34:19.753
She just gave me an earful.

34:19.796 --> 34:22.408
She certainly has a lot
to say about you.

34:22.451 --> 34:25.106
- Like what?

34:25.150 --> 34:28.283
- First of all, she says
that you barely talk to girls.

34:28.327 --> 34:30.459
She says that you're soft.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.637
- I've had girlfriends.

34:34.681 --> 34:37.162
- Like Meredith, right?

34:38.685 --> 34:41.166
She says that you met her
in Connecticut at the carnival.

34:41.209 --> 34:42.384
- That's right.

34:42.428 --> 34:43.472
And my mother met her too.

34:43.516 --> 34:44.647
So my mother's full of crap.

34:44.691 --> 34:46.301
- She mentioned Meredith.

34:46.345 --> 34:50.697
She said that Meredith
felt sorry for you.

34:50.740 --> 34:52.177
- That's not true.

34:52.220 --> 34:54.570
- Your mother and Meredith
talked a lot about you.

34:56.790 --> 35:00.141
Your mother felt that Meredith
was out of your league.

35:00.185 --> 35:01.316
- Meredith loved me.

35:01.360 --> 35:04.406
- She loved you?
- Yes.

35:06.756 --> 35:10.238
- Okay, then where is she?

35:10.282 --> 35:12.588
She leave you?

35:12.632 --> 35:14.547
Or did she try to
and then you killed her?

35:14.590 --> 35:16.679
- I didn't kill anybody.

35:16.723 --> 35:18.420
- That's what your mother said.

35:18.464 --> 35:21.597
She said that you weren't
smart enough

35:21.641 --> 35:24.339
or ambitious enough
to commit a crime like that.

35:24.383 --> 35:28.561
She said that carnival work,
that was sort of your limit.

35:30.824 --> 35:33.261
And as a mother myself, I have
to say...

35:35.220 --> 35:36.569
I agree with her.

35:36.612 --> 35:38.397
- Well, you don't
know me, either.

35:38.440 --> 35:39.441
Do you?

35:42.792 --> 35:45.578
- I know that the guy
that I'm looking for...

35:49.582 --> 35:54.848
Is methodical.

35:54.891 --> 35:58.286
He's intelligent,
he's organized.

36:02.290 --> 36:05.859
He picked women that nobody--
nobody would look for.

36:05.902 --> 36:08.470
He found a location,

36:08.514 --> 36:12.126
and he kept it hidden
for ten years.

36:12.170 --> 36:15.434
Nobody--nobody was onto him.

36:17.784 --> 36:22.571
- So you think this guy that
you're looking for is smart?

36:22.615 --> 36:26.358
- Oh, yeah. I know he is.

36:26.401 --> 36:27.533
But your story--

36:27.576 --> 36:30.666
I mean,
I think your mother's right.

36:32.407 --> 36:34.627
This guy is special.

36:34.670 --> 36:36.672
Trust me, when they find him,

36:36.716 --> 36:38.674
they're gonna make
documentaries about him.

36:40.372 --> 36:41.677
Ten years.

36:41.721 --> 36:44.724
Ten years, and the owner
of the building

36:44.767 --> 36:47.596
had no idea
what was going on in there.

36:47.640 --> 36:51.252
-
How much you know.

36:51.296 --> 36:55.648
The owner, that Chinese guy?
I heard he's dead.

36:55.691 --> 37:00.261
- So you follow
the case closely?

37:00.305 --> 37:01.523
- Yeah.

37:01.567 --> 37:05.745
- All right.
So maybe I underestimated you.

37:05.788 --> 37:07.268
Okay.

37:07.312 --> 37:11.446
Our take, this guy
is not only smart,

37:11.490 --> 37:12.621
but he's lucky.

37:12.665 --> 37:15.842
- No, I think he's smart.
Very smart.

37:17.583 --> 37:20.977
- He's lucky enough to find
an abandoned building

37:21.021 --> 37:23.589
where the owner
just happens to be dead.

37:23.632 --> 37:25.417
- He didn't happen to be dead.

37:27.941 --> 37:29.421
- You knew him?

37:31.336 --> 37:33.860
- It's what I heard.

37:33.903 --> 37:38.299
Listen, the killer pretended
to be a buyer...

37:39.866 --> 37:43.957
Sat down with the landlord
to seal the deal over tea.

37:44.000 --> 37:48.483
"Yum cha," he called it.
Never saw it coming.

37:48.527 --> 37:50.268
- Saw what coming?

37:50.311 --> 37:51.573
- Tea was poisoned.

a heart attack.

Oh yeah, I killed all of them.

Beauty couldn't stop shaking.
