00:38.453 --> 00:39.442
Hey, Peggy Hill.

00:39.487 --> 00:41.648
Thanks for inviting us
to barbecue.

00:41.689 --> 00:44.624
Not to be rude, but is
this name brand soda?

00:44.659 --> 00:45.921
It taste kind of skunky.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.928
Well, of course it's name brand.

00:47.962 --> 00:50.487
It's MegaloMart Private Select.

00:50.532 --> 00:51.692
(sotto voce):
Idiots.

00:51.733 --> 00:53.098
Are the hot dogs ready?

00:53.134 --> 00:55.796
I got a movie to catch
in 12 minutes.

00:55.837 --> 00:56.804
You're leaving?

00:56.838 --> 00:58.738
Aw, this is a couples' event.

00:58.773 --> 01:00.741
And there's this movie
I'm dying to see.

01:00.775 --> 01:04.233
This one's got a Culkin
and a Baldwin in it.

01:04.279 --> 01:06.406
Well, the dogs will be done
in a few seconds.

01:06.447 --> 01:08.972
Oop, they're plumping.

01:09.017 --> 01:15.047
Hey, I was going
to sit there.

01:15.089 --> 01:16.056
Sorry.

01:16.090 --> 01:19.548
You said you were going
to sit there.

01:19.594 --> 01:22.085
Eventually.

01:22.130 --> 01:23.927
(sighs)

01:23.965 --> 01:27.059
Okay, everybody, dogs are up.

01:27.101 --> 01:29.501
Now Bill's in a rush,
so he gets first crack.

01:29.537 --> 01:30.504
I'll be speedy.

01:30.538 --> 01:36.499
Okay, we've got ketchup,
mustard, relish over there...
(gulping)

01:38.813 --> 01:40.974
(munching loudly)

01:41.015 --> 01:42.448
Sweet Jesus.

01:42.483 --> 01:45.680
Whoa, look at him go!

01:45.720 --> 01:49.747
Bill! Bill!
Those dogs are for everyone.

01:49.791 --> 01:56.424
(gulping noisily)

01:56.464 --> 01:59.763
(belches)

01:59.801 --> 02:02.031
That should do it.

02:02.070 --> 02:03.560
Wow.

02:03.605 --> 02:06.972
If there were 13 more dogs
on that platter

02:07.008 --> 02:10.500
Mr. Dauterive would be in the
Guinness Book of
World Records.

02:10.544 --> 02:14.641
And did you see how
excited Bobby was

02:14.682 --> 02:16.650
about that hot dog
eating record?

02:16.684 --> 02:19.915
If he ever puts together
fame and eating...

02:19.954 --> 02:22.479
(shudders):
Well, he might
end up like, uh...

02:22.523 --> 02:25.754
What was the name of that
large comedian who died?

02:25.793 --> 02:26.919
But it's nice for Bill

02:26.961 --> 02:29.225
to finally have something
he's good at.

02:29.263 --> 02:31.959
Might give him a reason
to live, and what not.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.991
What Bill needs is
a healthy relationship.

02:34.035 --> 02:36.503
Look how I turned
your life around.

02:36.537 --> 02:37.504
Now...

02:37.538 --> 02:39.506
Guess what?
I finally got a woman

02:39.540 --> 02:40.507
to agree to go outwith him.

02:40.541 --> 02:42.008
My God, you're kidding.
Who?

02:42.043 --> 02:44.375
Sunny Edmunds,
the new librarian.

02:44.412 --> 02:45.401
The perky one?

02:45.446 --> 02:47.414
No, the one who
won't make change.

02:47.448 --> 02:48.938
Did you try
the perky one?

02:48.983 --> 02:54.751
Yes, I did, and it
took the perk right
out of her.

02:54.789 --> 02:56.450
Yep.

02:56.491 --> 02:59.517
Bill, what the hell
was up with you and
the hot dogs?

02:59.560 --> 03:01.528
That was
the most disgusting thing

03:01.562 --> 03:04.190
I've ever seen in my life
or on the Internet.

03:04.232 --> 03:06.894
I'm sorry. I was in a hurry.

03:06.934 --> 03:08.128
The movie sucked.

03:08.169 --> 03:10.137
We had to wait
a whole three minutes

03:10.171 --> 03:11.331
for Hank to throw
on more dogs.

03:11.372 --> 03:14.205
Does your selfish gluttony
know no end?

03:14.242 --> 03:15.209
No.

03:15.243 --> 03:16.210
Now wait a minute,
Bill.

03:16.244 --> 03:17.871
Eating 12 hot dogs
in a minute

03:17.912 --> 03:20.710
is kind of a...
well, a talent.

03:20.748 --> 03:23.478
Huh. I hadn't thought
of it that way.

03:23.518 --> 03:24.951
DALE:
Nice, Hank.

03:24.986 --> 03:27.352
Do you want him to be
this Lonely pant-load

03:27.388 --> 03:28.980
for the rest of his life?

03:29.023 --> 03:31.184
As a matter of fact,
Peggy's got a gal

03:31.225 --> 03:34.490
who agreed to go out
on a date with Bill.

03:34.529 --> 03:36.429
That's right, an actual woman.

03:36.464 --> 03:37.431
No!

03:37.465 --> 03:40.366
Yep. Dinner.
Tomorrow night.

03:40.401 --> 03:41.732
Maybe you could
figure out

03:41.769 --> 03:45.535
what's causing that,
uh, god-awful smell
in your car.

03:45.573 --> 03:46.870
That was a frog.

03:46.908 --> 03:47.875
I guess I'll get rid of it.

03:47.909 --> 03:52.642
PEGGY:
Oh.

03:52.680 --> 03:53.647
I almost forgot.

03:53.681 --> 03:56.115
At dinner, do not order chicken.

03:56.150 --> 03:58.516
Sunny is terrified of birds.

03:58.553 --> 03:59.781
Roger that.

03:59.821 --> 04:03.120
By the way, I took the
liberty of changing our
dinner reservations

04:03.157 --> 04:04.784
to Pea Soup Swenson's.

04:04.826 --> 04:07.351
I can show off my talent,
as you say.

04:07.395 --> 04:09.295
If you eat ten bowls of soup

04:09.330 --> 04:11.298
everyone at your table
eats free.

04:11.332 --> 04:13.698
Seven!

04:13.735 --> 04:16.533
Aah...

04:16.571 --> 04:18.300
Sunny, you can
order yourself

04:18.339 --> 04:19.897
another whiskey sour.

04:19.940 --> 04:21.909
It's all going to
be on the house

04:21.942 --> 04:23.911
'cause I am a
soup-eating machine.

04:25.980 --> 04:30.041
(slurping)

04:30.084 --> 04:32.382
You promised me
a fat George Clooney.

04:32.420 --> 04:36.015
This is not
a fat George Clooney.

04:36.057 --> 04:38.025
Nine!

04:39.594 --> 04:41.186
Did Sunny go
to the bathroom?

04:41.229 --> 04:43.720
I think I'm wowing her.

04:43.765 --> 04:45.892
(sighs):
She left, Bill.

04:45.933 --> 04:47.195
Did she see a bird?

04:47.235 --> 04:48.202
(Peggy scoffs)

04:48.236 --> 04:49.203
You disgusted her.

04:49.237 --> 04:54.106
WOMAN:
Mmm, I like the
way you eat soup.

04:54.142 --> 04:55.268
Are you making fun of me?

04:55.309 --> 04:57.504
If you are, it's okay,
I just like to know.

04:57.545 --> 04:59.012
Hell, no.

04:59.046 --> 05:00.013
I follow the sport

05:00.047 --> 05:02.015
of competitive eating
very closely.

05:02.049 --> 05:03.641
But I've never
seen you before.

05:03.684 --> 05:05.413
Cyndi Beauchamp. Fan.

05:05.453 --> 05:06.420
Bill Dauterive.

05:06.454 --> 05:08.251
What do you mean by sport?

05:08.289 --> 05:11.486
I figured you were some
dark horse chow hog

05:11.526 --> 05:14.324
in town for the hot dog
eating championship.

05:14.362 --> 05:16.830
Haven't you ever
heard of the IFOCE?

05:16.864 --> 05:19.833
The International
Federation of
Competitive Eating?

05:19.867 --> 05:21.835
Okay, you are
making fun of him.

05:21.869 --> 05:23.131
We get the joke,
ha, ha, ha.

05:23.171 --> 05:24.297
Now move along, lady.

05:24.338 --> 05:26.238
The IFOCE is the real deal.

05:26.274 --> 05:28.538
They're like the NFL
of competitive eating.

05:28.576 --> 05:30.703
You know, Bill,
tomorrow night Dan Vasti...

05:30.745 --> 05:32.713
one of the greats
in the sport...

05:32.747 --> 05:34.715
is having a party
over in McMaynerbury.

05:34.749 --> 05:37.047
You should come.
Meet the other eaters.

05:37.084 --> 05:39.917
Hmm, I never say no
to a party in McMaynerbury.

05:39.954 --> 05:42.115
I have a feeling
about you.

05:42.156 --> 05:44.386
And I have slept with
enough competitive eaters

05:44.425 --> 05:47.394
to know greatness
when I see it.

05:47.428 --> 05:49.089
Thanks.

05:49.130 --> 05:54.966
(lively dance music playing)

05:55.002 --> 06:02.033
All right,
they've got pepper jack.

06:02.076 --> 06:07.912
Mmm. Oh, that's good shrimp.

06:07.949 --> 06:15.253
MAN:
Hey. Easy on
the shrimp.

06:15.289 --> 06:17.120
Save it for
game day, slugger.

06:17.158 --> 06:20.059
It's a real rookie
mistake to get your
grub on at a party.

06:20.094 --> 06:23.427
I'm sorry. This is my first
organized eating function.

06:23.464 --> 06:24.431
It's cool.

06:24.465 --> 06:26.433
Itâ€™s just if everyone here
decided to throw down

06:26.467 --> 06:29.027
I'd go broke.
(laughing)

06:29.070 --> 06:29.968
Dan Vasti.

06:30.004 --> 06:30.971
Bill Dauterive.

06:31.005 --> 06:32.063
Oh!

06:32.106 --> 06:35.234
You're the new gurgitator
Cyndi was telling me about.

06:35.276 --> 06:37.244
I noticed you breathe
through your nose...

06:37.278 --> 06:38.245
that's a good start.

06:38.279 --> 06:43.046
Boy, look at the size
of that trophy.

06:43.084 --> 06:44.642
Won that baby in Munich.

06:44.685 --> 06:45.811
Bratwurst.

06:45.853 --> 06:47.821
And those are
my three consecutive

06:47.855 --> 06:48.822
Mustard Yellow belts.

06:48.856 --> 06:51.256
I was going for four
and then... this.

06:51.292 --> 06:52.657
Massive heart attack.

06:52.693 --> 06:55.457
Triple bypass, 85 stitches,
goat valve.

06:55.496 --> 06:56.793
I'm so sorry.

06:56.831 --> 06:57.798
It's okay.

06:57.832 --> 07:00.198
I'm taking care of myself now.

07:00.234 --> 07:01.201
Red wine.

07:01.235 --> 07:04.363
You know, Bill,
the last big American

07:04.405 --> 07:07.636
to win the Mustard Yellow belt
was Steve Keiner in '99.

07:07.675 --> 07:09.643
Since then,
all the hot dog competitions

07:09.677 --> 07:11.804
have been won
by skinny Japanese guys.

07:11.846 --> 07:14.246
(sighs):
But I still believe
in the big man.

07:14.282 --> 07:15.544
HANK:
Wait a minute.

07:15.583 --> 07:19.485
America isn't
the hot dog champion?

07:19.520 --> 07:21.488
Well, how could you
let that happen?

07:21.522 --> 07:23.490
This whole nation
is stuffing its face.

07:23.524 --> 07:25.651
Can't one of us do it
at record speed?

07:25.693 --> 07:27.786
Yeah, it's unfreakin'
acceptable, man.

07:27.828 --> 07:29.557
Time for America to get cocky.

07:29.597 --> 07:30.586
Amen, brother.

07:30.631 --> 07:31.689
Aah-aah-aah!

07:31.732 --> 07:34.895
Hank Hill,
Bill Dauterive,
this is Kid Rock...

07:34.936 --> 07:37.461
competitive eating's
fan-o numero uno.

07:37.505 --> 07:39.769
Hell, yeah!

07:39.807 --> 07:41.331
(howls)

07:41.375 --> 07:44.276
Huh, I once canceled
a 12-city European tour

07:44.312 --> 07:46.678
to watch this grub gobbler
chow dog.

07:46.714 --> 07:50.616
Hey, Rock, check out
Nozawa between the
two big blondes.

07:50.651 --> 07:52.084
Takeru Nozawa.

07:52.119 --> 07:53.484
The reigning champ.

07:53.521 --> 07:54.488
Eats left

07:54.522 --> 07:55.489
drinks right.

07:55.523 --> 07:57.855
110 pounds
of pure stomach.

07:57.892 --> 07:59.689
50 hot dogs
in 12 minutes.

07:59.727 --> 08:00.694
Not one-five.

08:00.728 --> 08:01.695
Five-oh!

08:01.729 --> 08:02.696
Whoa.

08:02.730 --> 08:03.697
Hank Hill.

08:03.731 --> 08:08.600
Ken Irrawaddy.

08:08.636 --> 08:10.934
So, are you an eater?

08:10.972 --> 08:12.337
Yeah.
Laotian noodle champion.

08:12.373 --> 08:14.341
I'm branching out into hot dogs.

08:14.375 --> 08:15.342
No kidding.

08:15.376 --> 08:16.809
My neighbor's Laotian.

08:16.844 --> 08:19.813
You know a guy named Kahn?

08:19.847 --> 08:21.815
You're going to wear the belt
one day, baby.

08:21.849 --> 08:22.975
Hey, Cyndi.

08:23.017 --> 08:25.178
(scornfully):
Nozawa.

08:25.219 --> 08:28.586
When are you going to drop
these fat American losers

08:28.622 --> 08:30.487
and get with number one?

08:30.524 --> 08:31.491
Hey.

08:31.525 --> 08:33.686
You'd look damn sexy

08:33.727 --> 08:36.993
wearing nothing but
my Mustard Yellow
Championship belt.

08:37.030 --> 08:39.397
You know, I think
your Mustard Yellow belt

08:39.433 --> 08:43.062
is going to look pretty good
around my fat American gut.

08:43.104 --> 08:45.129
Baby, you're not ready yet...
not for Nozawa.

08:45.172 --> 08:46.332
Who are you?

08:46.374 --> 08:48.399
I'm Big Bill Dauterive.

08:48.442 --> 08:51.002
Come next weekend, I'm going
to eat the hell out of you!

08:51.045 --> 08:52.012
Hah! Chump!

08:52.046 --> 08:55.311
You don't know who
you're messing with!

08:55.349 --> 08:56.316
Oh, yeah?

08:56.350 --> 09:00.218
I'll tell you who you're messing
with... the USA!

09:00.254 --> 09:03.246
(chanting):
USA! USA!

09:03.290 --> 09:04.757
BOTH:
USA!

09:04.792 --> 09:10.059
ALL (chanting):
USA! USA!

09:10.097 --> 09:12.327
(chanting continues)

09:12.366 --> 09:14.027
USA! USA!

09:14.068 --> 09:15.228
Breathe and
swallow, Bill!

09:15.269 --> 09:16.236
Breath and swallow!

09:16.270 --> 09:18.238
Come on, you're
eating for America!

09:18.272 --> 09:19.239
I don't get it.

09:19.273 --> 09:21.241
Are you training him
to be an athlete

09:21.275 --> 09:22.902
or a colossal fat-ass?

09:22.943 --> 09:23.910
Dang it, Dale.

09:23.944 --> 09:26.845
When did you get to be
such a Negative Nellie?

09:26.881 --> 09:29.441
Why donâ€™t you try being
a Positive Pete?

09:29.483 --> 09:31.678
KAHN:
Oh, you poor,
deluded redneck.

09:31.719 --> 09:35.120
You actually think
you can eat more hot
dogs than Nozawa? Hah!

09:35.156 --> 09:37.886
Personally, my money
on Ken Irrawaddy...

09:37.925 --> 09:39.984
"The Laotian Commotion."

09:40.027 --> 09:42.188
He the Michael
Jordan of Laos.

09:42.229 --> 09:43.526
HANK:
Keep going, Bill.

09:43.564 --> 09:46.158
You've got to be able
to focus with distractions

09:46.200 --> 09:48.168
no matter how annoying
they are.

09:48.202 --> 09:51.831
Guess you haven't
heard of "Belt
of Fat theory!"

09:51.872 --> 09:53.567
(mumbling):
Belt of fat?

09:53.607 --> 09:56.201
That why fat guys can't keep up
with us skinny Asians.

09:56.243 --> 09:58.643
Your stomachs are trapped
in belt of fat.

09:58.679 --> 10:00.078
Got no room to stretch.

10:00.114 --> 10:02.412
Irrawaddy not only skinny
and flexible

10:02.450 --> 10:05.317
rumor has it
he got two stomachs.

10:05.352 --> 10:07.786
Huh. I met him at a party

10:07.822 --> 10:11.417
and his stomach seemed
perfectly normal.

10:11.459 --> 10:12.426
You met Irrawaddy?!

10:12.460 --> 10:14.860
Was he wearing the scarf
I knit for him?!

10:14.895 --> 10:15.862
BOBBY:
Mom.

10:15.896 --> 10:16.920
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

10:16.964 --> 10:17.931
Yes, what?

10:17.965 --> 10:22.766
Look what I made for
Dad in shop class...
a bird feeder.

10:22.803 --> 10:26.068
Or a shoe box.
I'll let him decide.

10:26.107 --> 10:28.166
HANK:
Throw down those dogs!

10:28.209 --> 10:30.177
Hey, what's
Mr. Dauterive doing?

10:30.211 --> 10:31.405
Whatever it is

10:31.445 --> 10:33.913
it sure is making him popular.

10:33.948 --> 10:35.176
Is he... eating?

10:35.216 --> 10:36.808
Let me see that.

10:36.851 --> 10:38.478
What did you do?

10:38.519 --> 10:41.818
Obviously you need to
work on your adhesives.

10:41.856 --> 10:45.553
I wouldn't show this
to your father just yet.

10:45.593 --> 10:47.117
But-but good try.

10:47.161 --> 10:49.129
Okay, now,
you just need to rank

10:49.163 --> 10:50.653
in the top five
to qualify.

10:50.698 --> 10:53.098
So you don't have to dazzle,
you just have to place.

10:53.134 --> 10:55.728
Remember, Honey Bear,
it's not Roman rules

10:55.769 --> 10:57.896
so whatever you do,
don't vomit.

10:57.938 --> 11:00.168
You keep those doggies
in your tummy

11:00.207 --> 11:02.471
and Cyndi will give
you the nummy-nummy.

11:02.510 --> 11:03.602
(whistle blowing)

11:03.644 --> 11:07.102
Next up, Nozawa
versus Ken Irrawaddy!

11:07.148 --> 11:10.311
(air horn blowing)

11:10.351 --> 11:11.909
Irrawaddy! Irrawaddy!

11:11.952 --> 11:16.048
Kom ak kin kow laoew!

11:16.090 --> 11:18.558
He nod at me! He nod at me!

11:18.592 --> 11:19.889
(whistle blowing)

11:19.927 --> 11:21.724
Mmm, they're
pretty fast.

11:21.762 --> 11:23.730
But here's the Dauterive's
strategy:

11:23.764 --> 11:25.789
Start off slow,
build the momentum

11:25.833 --> 11:28.700
and then kick hard
to the finish line.

11:28.736 --> 11:30.670
Those dogs are going down.

11:30.704 --> 11:31.830
Yeah, baby!

11:31.872 --> 11:35.069
Yeah, strap on the feed bag,
you tragic behemoth.

11:35.109 --> 11:39.773
How many dogs will it take
to make you feel whole inside?

11:39.813 --> 11:40.780
Shut up, Dale!

11:40.814 --> 11:43.612
This man is eating
for his country, Dale.

11:43.651 --> 11:46.381
What you're doing
is treason.

11:46.420 --> 11:48.911
(owling)

11:48.956 --> 11:51.424
Nazawa's down.

11:51.458 --> 11:52.789
Ooh!

11:52.826 --> 11:54.123
I've hear that
sound before.

11:54.161 --> 11:55.389
Hello,
colostomy bag.

11:55.429 --> 11:58.125
(air horn blowing)
Laos rules!

11:58.165 --> 12:02.295
All fall before the
might of Irrawaddy!

12:02.336 --> 12:03.826
(whistle blowing)

12:03.871 --> 12:04.929
Irrawaddy:
25-and-a-quarter.

12:04.972 --> 12:06.940
Irrawaddy is now
leading the pack.

12:06.974 --> 12:09.465
Last contestant:
Dauterive.

12:09.510 --> 12:11.341
You're soloing.

12:11.378 --> 12:12.345
Come on, baby,
focus.

12:12.379 --> 12:15.075
(sighs):
It's go time.

12:15.115 --> 12:17.515
Hail the conquering fat-ass!

12:17.551 --> 12:19.644
A lonely pig gorging himself

12:19.687 --> 12:22.451
on the lips and anuses
of his brothers.

12:22.489 --> 12:23.456
Dale, why don't you shut

12:23.490 --> 12:25.458
your skinny little
no-hot-dog-eating mouth?

12:25.492 --> 12:27.687
You know, I figured out
what your problem is.

12:27.728 --> 12:29.389
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.

12:29.430 --> 12:34.367
I think you're a little jealous
of the Dauterive.

12:34.401 --> 12:35.368
Jealous?!

12:35.402 --> 12:37.165
OFFICIAL:
On your mark...

12:37.204 --> 12:38.262
get set...

12:38.305 --> 12:39.272
go!

12:39.306 --> 12:40.534
Jealous of this?

12:40.574 --> 12:43.873
Any idiot
can eat hot dogs.

12:43.911 --> 12:46.675
It's not a talent.

12:46.714 --> 12:48.011
(munching)

12:48.048 --> 12:50.573
Look, I'll go two at a time.

12:50.618 --> 12:53.212
(munching loudly)

12:53.254 --> 12:54.778
See? It's nothing special.

12:54.822 --> 12:57.484
I can eat three at a time.
Who cares?

12:57.524 --> 12:58.889
He's tri-doggin'!

12:58.926 --> 12:59.893
Come on, Bill.

12:59.927 --> 13:01.019
Wolf it!

13:01.061 --> 13:19.743
(gulping)

13:19.780 --> 13:20.769
(whistle blowing)

13:20.814 --> 13:23.578
Dauterive:
22-and-a-half.

13:23.617 --> 13:26.609
New guy:
34-and-an-eighth!

13:26.654 --> 13:28.246
(crowd gasping)

13:28.289 --> 13:29.256
Congratulations, gentlemen.

13:29.290 --> 13:30.780
You both qualify.

13:30.824 --> 13:32.155
What's your name, gladiator?

13:32.192 --> 13:34.217
Dale Gribble.

13:34.261 --> 13:36.286
(crowd chanting):
Gribble! Gribble! USA!

13:36.330 --> 13:38.525
Gribble! Gribble! USA!

13:38.565 --> 13:40.260
Dude, will you sign my face?

13:40.301 --> 13:43.099
Huh?

13:43.137 --> 13:45.298
What about
the Dauterive?

13:51.378 --> 13:54.711
BILL (sobbing):
Why? Tell me...

13:54.748 --> 13:58.377
why give me a great gift,
only to snatch it away?

13:58.419 --> 14:00.080
What did I do, huh?

14:00.120 --> 14:01.917
D-Did I ask for too much?

14:01.955 --> 14:07.791
Did I fly too close to the sun
on my beautiful hot dog wings?

14:07.828 --> 14:10.797
(yelling):
Why do you like Dale better?!

14:10.831 --> 14:12.264
I hate you!

14:12.299 --> 14:16.929
I'm so sorry,
I didn't mean that.

14:16.970 --> 14:20.064
Please, help me eat
more hot dogs than Dale!

14:20.107 --> 14:21.074
Please!

14:21.108 --> 14:22.075
(whimpers)

14:22.109 --> 14:25.044
Boy, I still
can't get over Dale.

14:25.079 --> 14:26.239
What a dogger.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.407
That little alley of
yours is turning into

14:28.449 --> 14:29.507
quite a freak show.

14:29.550 --> 14:31.484
(sighs)
What do I do now?

14:31.518 --> 14:33.611
Ah, dang it, Bill.

14:33.654 --> 14:35.713
I've got to go
with the winner tomorrow.

14:35.756 --> 14:37.724
This country's honor
is at stake.

14:37.758 --> 14:39.726
Well, I do not know
how much longer

14:39.760 --> 14:40.749
I can keep Bobby away.

14:40.794 --> 14:43.729
Today he heard Bill training,
so I stabbed my thumb

14:43.764 --> 14:45.732
with a ballpoint pen
to distract him.

14:45.766 --> 14:47.290
Good work.
Thank you.

14:47.334 --> 14:48.961
I think it's infected.

14:54.475 --> 14:57.467
So, have you gotten a chance
to read my short story?

14:57.644 --> 15:01.205
I kinda had, uh...
had some stuff to me.

15:01.248 --> 15:02.977
Fresh-baked muffins,
anyone?

15:03.016 --> 15:04.608
You know I love muffins.

15:04.651 --> 15:07.176
Got any cranberry banana
macadamia nut?

15:07.221 --> 15:08.882
Actually,
that's all I've got.

15:08.922 --> 15:11.857
Oh. When it comes to muffins,
I can't help myself.

15:11.892 --> 15:13.223
I'm a muffaholic.

15:13.260 --> 15:16.127
Mmm!

15:16.163 --> 15:17.255
Hey, Hank, Bill baked

15:17.297 --> 15:19.925
fresh cranberry banana
macadamia nut muffins.

15:19.967 --> 15:22.697
Bill, Boomhauer's
allergic to macadamias

15:22.736 --> 15:25.102
and you know
I don't eat cranberries.

15:25.139 --> 15:27.130
We've had this
conversation before.

15:27.174 --> 15:30.905
Wait a minute.

15:30.944 --> 15:34.004
My muffin!

15:34.047 --> 15:36.072
Dang it, don't you see
what he's doing?

15:36.116 --> 15:37.083
He's filling you up

15:37.117 --> 15:39.085
so you won't be able
to compete today.

15:39.119 --> 15:41.815
That is
an outrageous accusation!

15:41.855 --> 15:44.585
You're sabotaging your friend
and your country.

15:44.625 --> 15:47.219
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself.

15:47.261 --> 15:48.728
Yeah, but... um... oh!

15:48.762 --> 15:49.729
I'm sorry!

15:49.763 --> 15:52.129
But what am I supposed to do?

15:52.166 --> 15:53.997
I want to bring home

15:54.034 --> 15:56.264
the Mustard Yellow Belt
to America!

15:56.303 --> 15:57.395
Me! The Dauterive!

15:57.438 --> 15:59.269
Oh, for God sakes, Bill.

15:59.306 --> 16:03.037
I wasn't even planning on going
to the competition.

16:03.076 --> 16:04.043
(sighs)

16:04.077 --> 16:05.044
Dale...

16:05.078 --> 16:06.636
Lady liberty
is a proud woman.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.739
She doesn't like
to ask her boys for help

16:08.782 --> 16:11.114
but when she does blow
the horn of freedom

16:11.151 --> 16:13.813
I tell you, mister...

16:13.854 --> 16:16.322
I'm sorry, Hank, but I'm
not joining that freak show.

16:16.356 --> 16:18.153
How can you say that?

16:18.192 --> 16:20.319
Because I'm a freak!

16:20.360 --> 16:21.327
I know!

16:21.361 --> 16:23.556
I've been there,
and I donâ€™t want to go back!

16:23.597 --> 16:24.564
'Sright.

16:24.598 --> 16:28.500
It was the fifth grade.

16:28.535 --> 16:31.868
I had a touch
of the social anxiety disorder

16:31.905 --> 16:34.669
and medication
was not readily available

16:34.708 --> 16:36.903
or indeed invented yet.

16:36.944 --> 16:39.640
I had a hard time making
connections with people.

16:39.680 --> 16:42.274
GIRL:
Did you see that?

16:42.316 --> 16:45.479
Yuck! That
guy ate a bug!

16:45.519 --> 16:46.486
Eww!

16:46.520 --> 16:47.646
Do it again.

16:47.688 --> 16:51.089
By the next week, I
was putting on shows at recess.

16:51.124 --> 16:55.390
KIDS:
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

16:55.429 --> 16:58.330
I was an eating machine...
crickets, spiders

16:58.365 --> 17:00.196
dung beetles.

17:00.234 --> 17:05.866
I thought I was so cool.

17:05.906 --> 17:07.737
Eat it!

17:07.773 --> 17:10.571
That's so gross!

17:10.611 --> 17:13.375
That is yucky!

17:13.413 --> 17:15.278
Eat more!

17:15.315 --> 17:18.284
What a freak.

17:18.318 --> 17:21.583
Remember, Bill, just because
you have their attention

17:21.622 --> 17:25.319
doesn't mean you have
their respect.

17:25.358 --> 17:28.624
So Bill, I guess
you're America's only hope.

17:28.662 --> 17:29.560
Are you in?

17:29.596 --> 17:30.563
I am so in.

17:30.597 --> 17:31.564
Oh...

17:31.598 --> 17:32.758
Hank?

17:44.678 --> 17:45.872
Is there any chance

17:45.913 --> 17:48.177
I might be able to get
some alone time with Dale and...

17:48.215 --> 17:50.342
"persuade" him?

17:50.384 --> 17:51.976
Keep your
pants on, lady.

17:52.019 --> 17:53.281
My wife's
hotter than you

17:53.320 --> 17:54.651
and she throws
more sex at me

17:54.688 --> 17:57.179
than I know
what to do with.

17:57.224 --> 18:00.557
Cyndi, believe in the big man.

18:00.594 --> 18:01.686
Show me a miracle, baby.

18:01.728 --> 18:07.394
PEGGY:
The outlet mall
is a bit of a drive

18:07.434 --> 18:08.458
but God help me

18:08.502 --> 18:10.470
I love those
discontinued pantsuits.

18:10.504 --> 18:13.234
Hey, look,
the County Fair!

18:13.273 --> 18:16.606
Something about
a hot dog contest.

18:16.643 --> 18:18.611
I could go for a hot dog.

18:18.645 --> 18:19.669
Maybe even two.

18:19.713 --> 18:21.908
Oh, good, here's another sign.

18:21.949 --> 18:23.246
Mom, what are you doing?!

18:23.283 --> 18:24.443
Well, you know,
it just occurred to me...

18:24.484 --> 18:27.612
I have never
taken you fishing!

18:37.364 --> 18:39.491
OFFICIAL:
Gladiators,
hands on the table.

18:39.533 --> 18:41.091
Judges, you ready?

18:41.134 --> 18:42.431
On your mark...

18:42.469 --> 18:43.231
get set...

18:43.270 --> 18:46.899
eat!

18:53.814 --> 18:54.974
Dang it,
Irraawaddy's
already up

18:55.015 --> 18:57.040
two dogs on Bill.

18:57.084 --> 18:58.244
He's got to kick.

18:58.285 --> 18:59.877
Too soon.
He'll flame out!

18:59.920 --> 19:00.784
(air horn blares)

19:00.821 --> 19:02.448
â™ª Laos rules â™ª

19:02.489 --> 19:05.583
â™ª Laos rules! â™ª

19:05.626 --> 19:07.992
Uh, arenâ€™t we supposed
to have fishing rods?

19:08.028 --> 19:09.495
Fishing rods?
(sputters lips)

19:09.529 --> 19:11.895
Have you ever seen a bear
use a fishing rod?

19:11.932 --> 19:14.162
Here, use the tackle
God gave you.

19:14.201 --> 19:16.692
Look, look,
there's a sturgeon!

19:16.737 --> 19:20.264
Slap it out
of the water, Bobby!

19:20.307 --> 19:22.798
Where? I don't see it.

19:22.843 --> 19:28.406
Oh, you're scaring him away with
all your talk, talk, talking!

19:28.448 --> 19:30.439
DAN:
Look, Bill's kicking!

19:30.484 --> 19:31.473
He's kicking!

19:31.518 --> 19:33.008
C'mon, work it!

19:33.053 --> 19:34.020
He's ahead!

19:34.054 --> 19:35.043
Go, Bill!

19:35.088 --> 19:37.750
Attack the dog!
Attack the dog!

19:37.791 --> 19:40.487
(chanting):
USA, USA...

19:40.527 --> 19:43.189
KAHN:
Come on,
Irrawaddy!

19:43.230 --> 19:46.597
Laos is depending
on you!

19:46.633 --> 19:48.658
Dauterive!
Go, Dauterive!

19:48.702 --> 19:52.035
Eat it! Eat it!

19:52.072 --> 19:54.097
(no audio)

19:54.141 --> 19:57.508
DALE:
Is he? Is he?

19:57.544 --> 20:00.206
He is!
He's quitting!

20:00.247 --> 20:02.238
All right, Bill!

20:02.282 --> 20:03.249
No!

20:03.283 --> 20:04.978
Come on, Bill!

20:05.018 --> 20:06.349
USA! USA?

20:06.386 --> 20:08.684
Hank... I'm full.

20:08.722 --> 20:09.689
I know, buddy.

20:09.723 --> 20:11.156
Just another 15 dogs.

20:11.191 --> 20:12.920
But they're laughing at me.

20:12.959 --> 20:14.256
Do I have to keep doing this?

20:14.294 --> 20:15.283
Uh...

20:15.328 --> 20:19.924
I guess it's
for America.

20:23.670 --> 20:25.968
You know, Bill,
America doesn't need to win

20:26.006 --> 20:27.530
every dang thing
to be great.

20:27.574 --> 20:31.066
We've got the Constitution,
two George Bushes

20:31.111 --> 20:32.476
great toilets.

20:32.512 --> 20:35.003
Hell, we played golf
on the moon.

20:35.048 --> 20:38.415
I guess we can let Laos have a
stupid wiener contest, canâ€™t we?

20:38.452 --> 20:44.448
DAN:
What the hell
are you doing?!

20:44.491 --> 20:49.758
Bill, you fool,
there's still time!

20:49.796 --> 20:51.957
Dude, get back in there
and eat like the wind!

20:51.998 --> 20:55.331
Thank you for the hot dogs,
but I've had enough to eat.

20:55.368 --> 20:57.336
I bid you good day.

20:57.370 --> 20:58.837
OFFICIAL:
And the winner...

20:58.872 --> 21:01.272
Ken Irrawaddy,
from Laos!

21:01.308 --> 21:03.071
(air horn blares)

21:03.110 --> 21:06.705
This is the proudest
day of my life!

21:06.747 --> 21:08.078
Oh, that's it!

21:08.115 --> 21:12.142
I'm quitting music
and putting on the bib.

21:12.185 --> 21:13.516
(triumphant shout)

21:13.553 --> 21:16.044
So, uh, things
still on with Cyndi?

21:16.089 --> 21:17.056
No.

21:17.090 --> 21:20.719
Well, at least you got
a little chicka-womp-womp.

21:20.761 --> 21:23.958
Actually, we were
saving it for tonight.

21:23.997 --> 21:26.022
My idea.

21:26.066 --> 21:27.033
Attaboy, Bill.

Yep.
