WEBVTT

00:04.650 --> 00:08.148
So, what do you say, we kill some evil
sons of bitches and we raise hell?

00:11.197 --> 00:12.655
Sam, look out!

00:14.032 --> 00:15.313
Sam!

00:15.492 --> 00:18.492
Offering up your own soul?
- All you gotta do is bring Sam back.

00:18.661 --> 00:21.330
I'll give you one year
and one year only.

00:22.789 --> 00:24.164
I couldn't let him die.

00:24.332 --> 00:26.490
- He's my brother.
- I could throttle you.

00:26.918 --> 00:28.993
I don't care,
I'm gonna get you out of this.

00:29.170 --> 00:30.545
Trap the Crossroads Demon...

00:30.712 --> 00:33.832
...try to welsh our way out of the deal
in any way, you die.

00:37.926 --> 00:39.883
- What kind of blade can kill a demon?
- Aah!

00:40.053 --> 00:41.676
I said there was no such thing.

00:41.845 --> 00:43.256
Who was that masked chick?

00:44.764 --> 00:48.429
Who the hell are you?
- I'm the girl that just saved your ass.

01:12.620 --> 01:14.529
Hey, sweetie.

01:15.455 --> 01:17.578
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:18.833 --> 01:22.367
- Thanks for driving her back here.
- Well, it's not like I had a choice.

01:22.544 --> 01:24.086
She pitched a fit.

01:26.798 --> 01:27.912
Hey, sweetie.

01:29.675 --> 01:31.501
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:31.677 --> 01:32.791
I missed you.

01:32.969 --> 01:36.254
- Okay, but tonight's Dad's night.
- No. I don't like Dad's night.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.138
I don't want Dad to have a night.

01:38.307 --> 01:40.133
Since when?

01:40.308 --> 01:42.680
You used to love going
to your dad's house.

01:42.852 --> 01:44.560
He loves you. He misses you a lot.

01:44.729 --> 01:46.353
But I hate it there.

01:46.522 --> 01:48.561
- You don't hate it.
- Yes, I do. He's mean.

01:48.732 --> 01:52.598
And there are monsters there.
I don't want to go back.

01:52.985 --> 01:55.901
Please don't let the monsters get me.

01:56.445 --> 01:58.484
Okay, sweetie.

01:59.448 --> 02:00.562
Okay.

03:53.246 --> 03:55.202
What do you mean
it won't work, Bobby?

03:55.372 --> 03:56.652
It's a demon-dispelling ritual.

03:59.459 --> 04:01.119
Maybe we got the translation wrong.

04:01.877 --> 04:03.917
We can't let Dean fry in hell while we...

04:05.380 --> 04:08.998
Well, there's gotta be something...
Okay, yeah. No. I gotta go. Never mind.

04:09.759 --> 04:11.003
- Hey.
- Who was that?

04:11.177 --> 04:13.085
Oh, I was just ordering pizza.

04:13.804 --> 04:15.630
You do realize you're in a restaurant?

04:15.805 --> 04:19.966
Yeah. Yeah, oh, yeah.
I just felt like pizza, you know?

04:21.517 --> 04:24.470
Okay, Weirdy McWeirderton.

04:24.645 --> 04:27.313
Ahh. So I think I got something.

04:27.480 --> 04:30.646
- Yeah?
- Cicero, Indiana.

04:30.816 --> 04:32.974
Falls on his own power saw.

04:36.529 --> 04:37.809
And?

04:37.989 --> 04:39.981
What, that's it? One power saw?

04:41.074 --> 04:43.399
Well, yeah.

04:45.328 --> 04:47.486
And you think that this is a case?

04:47.663 --> 04:49.572
Well, I don't know. Could be.

04:49.748 --> 04:52.369
- I don't know, Dean...
- There's something better in...

04:52.542 --> 04:54.499
Better in Cicero than just a case.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.703
- And that is?
- Lisa Braeden.

04:58.838 --> 05:01.507
- Should I even ask?
- Remember that road trip I took...

05:01.674 --> 05:04.165
...eight years ago?
You were in Orlando with Dad...

05:04.343 --> 05:06.833
...wrapping up that Banshee thing.
- Yeah, yeah.

05:07.012 --> 05:08.470
- Five States, five days.
- Yeah.

05:08.638 --> 05:10.132
- Well, kind of.
- Right.

05:10.306 --> 05:12.713
I spent most of my time
in Lisa Braeden's loft.

05:12.891 --> 05:14.302
So let me get this straight.

05:14.476 --> 05:17.725
You wanna drive all the way to Cicero
to hook up with some chick?

05:18.187 --> 05:19.895
She was a yoga teacher.

05:20.064 --> 05:22.020
That was the bendiest weekend
of my life.

05:22.190 --> 05:24.977
Come on, have a heart, huh?
It's my dying wish.

05:25.151 --> 05:27.190
How many dying wishes
are you gonna get?

05:27.361 --> 05:29.484
As many as I can squeeze out.

05:30.697 --> 05:32.937
Come on. Smile, Sam.

05:33.115 --> 05:35.901
God knows I'm gonna be smiling
after 24 hours with Gumby girl.

05:37.618 --> 05:39.907
Gumby girl.

05:40.662 --> 05:42.868
Does that make me Pokey?

05:50.420 --> 05:51.914
Don't wait up for me, Sammy.

05:53.297 --> 05:55.290
Oh, Dean, Dean...

06:37.708 --> 06:39.534
Dean. Heh.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.532
Lisa. How's it going?

06:42.753 --> 06:43.916
Wow. Heh.

06:44.088 --> 06:45.996
So how long's it been?

06:46.172 --> 06:49.042
Eight, going on nine years now.

06:49.216 --> 06:50.924
- Crazy, right?
- Yeah.

06:51.593 --> 06:53.632
So, what are you doing here?

06:53.803 --> 06:58.594
Oh, I was just... I was passing through,
and I couldn't resist.

06:58.765 --> 07:01.256
I remembered that you love surprises.

07:03.269 --> 07:04.928
Yeah.

07:05.521 --> 07:07.312
- Dean Winchester.
- Hm.

07:07.480 --> 07:11.691
Heh. Wow, just wow. Ha-ha.

07:12.443 --> 07:14.482
I'm sorry.
You kind of came at a bad time.

07:14.653 --> 07:16.775
- We're having a party.
- Party?

07:17.989 --> 07:19.187
Well, I love parties.

07:28.873 --> 07:31.280
So who's the party for?

07:31.458 --> 07:33.331
Ben. My son.

07:33.501 --> 07:36.336
- Oh, you have a...?
- Yeah.

07:36.629 --> 07:37.873
That's him.

07:38.046 --> 07:40.798
Yes! AC/DC rules!

07:41.466 --> 07:43.838
Awesome. That is so cool.

07:44.010 --> 07:46.251
- How old...?
- Eight.

07:48.638 --> 07:50.880
Oh, Dean, could you excuse me
a minute?

07:51.057 --> 07:53.464
Yeah, sure, don't mind me.

08:10.279 --> 08:12.236
Did you hear Lisa call him Dean?

08:12.406 --> 08:15.276
- Yeah, why?
- You don't know about Dean?

08:15.450 --> 08:18.949
The Dean?
Best-Night-of-My-Life Dean?

08:19.120 --> 08:20.911
No. Tell me.

08:21.080 --> 08:26.156
Oh, my God.
So they had this crazy, semi-illegal...

08:28.169 --> 08:29.663
Hi.

08:30.170 --> 08:31.498
Hi.

08:31.671 --> 08:33.414
Hello.

08:39.344 --> 08:40.755
Whew.

08:45.349 --> 08:46.760
What's up?

08:46.934 --> 08:48.760
What's up with you?

08:59.986 --> 09:01.978
- So it's your birthday.
- Guilty.

09:03.197 --> 09:06.399
- It's a cool party.
- Dude, it's so freaking sweet.

09:06.574 --> 09:08.863
And this Moonbounce? It's epic.

09:10.327 --> 09:11.571
Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

09:11.744 --> 09:13.783
You know who else thinks
they're awesome?

09:14.204 --> 09:17.288
Chicks. It's like hot-chick city
out there.

09:22.878 --> 09:28.298
Look out, ladies,
here comes trouble. Yee-ha!

09:37.848 --> 09:39.924
So how you holding up?

09:40.809 --> 09:42.718
- Fine.
- Really?

09:43.936 --> 09:46.308
Yeah, you know.

09:48.482 --> 09:49.940
I just...

09:53.486 --> 09:54.979
- Never mind.
- What?

09:59.198 --> 10:00.858
It's just...

10:02.493 --> 10:04.284
I'm worried about Katie.

10:04.453 --> 10:06.943
I think there might be something...

10:07.372 --> 10:08.866
...wrong with her.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.154
Of course there is.

10:10.332 --> 10:12.739
Poor girl just lost her dad,
she's devastated.

10:12.918 --> 10:15.242
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

10:15.837 --> 10:20.462
There is something really wrong
with her.

10:25.385 --> 10:27.792
I'm not sure that Katie...

10:28.888 --> 10:30.263
...is Katie.

10:30.431 --> 10:31.972
What?

10:35.268 --> 10:37.640
I'm not sure that's my daughter.

10:38.604 --> 10:39.979
I know you're grieving.

10:40.147 --> 10:42.554
But you can't talk like that.
Katie needs you now.

10:42.732 --> 10:45.401
- No. You don't understand...
- We're gonna get you help.

10:45.568 --> 10:47.359
It'll be okay.

10:52.406 --> 10:54.197
Katie.

10:54.408 --> 10:56.365
Come on, we're leaving.

10:59.037 --> 11:00.744
Hey.

11:00.913 --> 11:03.202
So I met Ben.

11:06.918 --> 11:09.455
- Cool kid.
Yeah.

11:10.296 --> 11:11.410
Yeah.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.456
You know, I couldn't help
but notice that he's turning 8.

11:18.802 --> 11:20.878
You and me. You know.

11:25.725 --> 11:28.132
You're not trying to ask me
if he's yours?

11:28.310 --> 11:30.101
No, no, of course not.

11:32.855 --> 11:34.515
- He's not, is he?
- What?

11:35.733 --> 11:38.732
- No.
- Right.

11:42.612 --> 11:43.691
Yeah.

11:45.740 --> 11:48.312
Katie, sweetheart, we gotta go, okay?
Come on.

11:50.535 --> 11:52.195
Come on, Katie.

11:53.579 --> 11:55.618
Something wrong with your friend?

11:55.789 --> 11:57.069
She's been through a lot.

11:57.249 --> 11:59.786
Her ex just died
in this horrible accident.

12:00.418 --> 12:01.746
Didn't I read about that?

12:01.919 --> 12:04.670
- The power saw?
- Yeah.

12:04.838 --> 12:08.206
I guess there's been a lot of bad luck
in the neighborhood lately.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.043
What kind of bad luck?

12:27.856 --> 12:29.315
Hello, Sam.

12:36.947 --> 12:39.319
You've been following me
since Lincoln.

12:39.741 --> 12:41.152
Not much gets by you, huh?

12:42.785 --> 12:44.908
Mm. These are amazing.

12:45.079 --> 12:47.320
It's like deep-fried crack. Try some.

12:53.084 --> 12:55.123
That knife you had...

12:55.294 --> 12:56.919
...you can kill demons with that?

12:57.087 --> 13:01.380
Comes in handy when I have to swoop in
and save the damsel in distress.

13:02.091 --> 13:04.000
- Where'd you get it?
- SkyMall.

13:07.262 --> 13:08.673
Why are you following me?

13:08.847 --> 13:11.053
I'm interested in you.

13:13.058 --> 13:14.517
Why?

13:14.685 --> 13:15.799
Because you're tall.

13:16.811 --> 13:19.053
I love a tall man.

13:20.189 --> 13:22.561
And then there's the whole
antichrist thing.

13:22.733 --> 13:25.223
- Excuse me?
- You know, generation of psychic kids.

13:25.402 --> 13:28.485
<i>Yellow-Eyed Demon rounds you up,
Celebrity Deathmatch ensues...</i>

13:28.654 --> 13:31.275
...you're the sole survivor.

13:31.448 --> 13:34.947
- How do you know about that?
- I'm a good hunter.

13:35.451 --> 13:40.278
- So Yellow Eyes had big plans for you.
- Had being the key word.

13:40.455 --> 13:42.033
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right.

13:42.207 --> 13:45.492
Ding-dong, the demon's dead.
Good job with that.

13:46.085 --> 13:48.373
It doesn't change the fact
that you're special.

13:48.545 --> 13:51.498
In that Anthony-Michael-Hall,
ESP-vision kind of way.

13:51.673 --> 13:55.504
No, that stuff's not happening anymore.
Not since Yellow Eyes died.

13:55.676 --> 13:57.549
I'm thinking you're still a big deal.

13:57.719 --> 14:00.423
I mean, after all that business
with your mom.

14:00.596 --> 14:01.627
What about my mom?

14:01.806 --> 14:03.761
You know,
what happened to her friends.

14:08.310 --> 14:11.429
You don't know.

14:12.938 --> 14:17.315
You've got a little bit of catching up
to do, my friend.

14:17.942 --> 14:22.899
So why don't you look
into your mom's pals...

14:23.072 --> 14:26.025
...and then give me a call
and we'll talk again.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.952
And by the way, you do know
there's a job in this town, right?

14:41.294 --> 14:42.788
<i>Hello?
- Dude.</i>

14:42.962 --> 14:44.077
There is a job here.

14:45.798 --> 14:46.960
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

14:47.132 --> 14:48.840
That accident we read in the paper?

14:49.009 --> 14:51.334
Turns out there's more
that never made the paper.

14:51.511 --> 14:53.883
All in this Morning Hill
gated community.

14:54.055 --> 14:57.802
<i>People falling off ladders, drown
in Jacuzzis all over the neighborhood.</i>

14:57.974 --> 14:59.516
<i>- That is weird.
- Something's up.</i>

14:59.684 --> 15:03.052
Something these nice big gates
can't protect them from.

15:21.659 --> 15:23.069
Katie.

15:24.286 --> 15:27.405
- What are you doing?
- Play with me, Mommy.

15:29.332 --> 15:32.202
Okay, sure. Yeah, let's play.

15:32.376 --> 15:34.119
Oh, good.

15:35.044 --> 15:37.333
I love you, Mommy.

15:38.881 --> 15:40.375
I love you too, sweetie.

15:53.392 --> 15:55.349
I'm hungry, Mommy.

15:59.314 --> 16:00.856
Yeah.

16:01.524 --> 16:02.982
Yeah.

16:08.613 --> 16:10.688
Once again,
I'm very sorry to disturb you.

16:10.865 --> 16:13.071
We wanna expedite
that life-insurance policy.

16:13.242 --> 16:15.068
- Of course.
- Okay.

16:16.786 --> 16:18.778
This is where he fell.

16:19.205 --> 16:20.829
I see.

16:20.998 --> 16:22.408
Now, how exactly did he...?

16:22.582 --> 16:25.333
He was just inside,
changing a light bulb.

16:25.501 --> 16:26.995
Must've lost his balance.

16:27.169 --> 16:29.326
- Were you here when this happened?
- I was out.

16:29.503 --> 16:31.626
The only one here
was our daughter, Dakota.

16:31.797 --> 16:33.339
Okay.

16:54.857 --> 16:58.391
Okay, well, I think that's all I need.
I'll get out of your way now.

16:58.568 --> 17:00.192
Okay. Thank you.

17:27.967 --> 17:29.046
Thank you, Mommy.

17:31.094 --> 17:32.885
You eat.

17:33.054 --> 17:35.177
Mommy will be right back.

17:48.774 --> 17:50.019
Mommy?

17:50.192 --> 17:53.145
Just a sec...
Just give Mommy a second.

17:54.111 --> 17:55.274
Let me in.

17:56.947 --> 17:58.904
Mommy?

17:59.783 --> 18:01.063
Let me in.

18:03.411 --> 18:04.786
Mommy.

18:05.621 --> 18:07.992
Let me in!
What are you doing?

18:08.164 --> 18:11.248
- Just give Mommy a minute.
- Let me in! Let me in, let me in!

18:11.417 --> 18:12.615
Let me in!

18:14.169 --> 18:16.541
Let me in! Let me in!

18:16.713 --> 18:19.084
Just give Mommy a minute.

18:33.977 --> 18:36.384
Aren't you just the cutest thing.

18:39.523 --> 18:41.431
Oh, thank you.

18:42.650 --> 18:45.105
Katie, could you put these
in the kitchen, please.

18:49.572 --> 18:52.241
- Katie seems okay considering...
- She's fine. Look...

18:52.408 --> 18:54.613
And you? How are you doing, really?

18:54.784 --> 18:56.028
I'm fine.

18:56.202 --> 18:58.158
We're fine. This isn't a good time...

18:58.328 --> 19:00.404
I wasn't sure
if you're keeping the house...

19:00.580 --> 19:02.537
...or selling. We at Cicero Realty...

19:02.707 --> 19:04.533
Look, I told you it's not a good time.

19:11.464 --> 19:12.958
I want ice cream.

19:13.507 --> 19:16.044
Mommy. Ice cream, please.

19:19.178 --> 19:20.802
Thank you.

19:30.604 --> 19:32.395
Guys.

19:35.149 --> 19:37.058
Hide-and-seek, hide-and-seek.

19:37.526 --> 19:39.234
Hey, Ben.

19:39.403 --> 19:41.609
Hey. You were at my party.

19:41.779 --> 19:43.523
Yeah. Yeah, I'm Dean.

19:53.998 --> 19:56.369
Everything okay? Something wrong?

20:04.172 --> 20:07.088
- That your game they're playing with?
- Ryan borrowed it.

20:07.257 --> 20:08.716
And now he won't give it back.

20:08.883 --> 20:11.041
- You want me to go...?
- No. Don't go there.

20:11.219 --> 20:12.878
Only bitches send a grownup.

20:15.764 --> 20:18.219
- You're not wrong.
- And I am not a bitch.

20:23.020 --> 20:26.186
Is that Humphrey? The one
who needs to lay off the burgers?

20:28.732 --> 20:30.226
Hmm.

20:30.984 --> 20:32.229
Get it. Go excited.

20:32.402 --> 20:34.193
Come on. Come on.

20:34.362 --> 20:36.271
Wait, wait, go back.

20:47.831 --> 20:49.289
Ryan.

20:53.794 --> 20:57.708
- I'd like my game back, please.
- Fine, take it back.

21:07.055 --> 21:08.549
See? Told you guys he was...

21:16.771 --> 21:18.597
Thanks.

21:21.607 --> 21:22.638
Dude. That was awesome.

21:22.816 --> 21:25.437
- Up high. Nice work.
Benjamin Isaac Braeden.

21:25.610 --> 21:27.851
- What's gotten into you?
- He stole my game.

21:28.029 --> 21:29.736
So you kick him? Since when is...?

21:32.908 --> 21:34.947
Did you tell my son
to beat up that kid?

21:35.118 --> 21:36.362
What?

21:36.535 --> 21:38.611
Somebody had to teach him
how to kick a bully in the nads.

21:38.787 --> 21:42.120
- Who asked you to teach him anything?
- Just relax, I...

21:42.290 --> 21:43.535
What are you doing here?

21:43.708 --> 21:45.996
We had one weekend together
a million years ago.

21:46.168 --> 21:48.741
You don't know me.
You have no business with my son.

21:49.379 --> 21:51.834
- Lisa.
- Just leave us alone.

21:56.093 --> 21:57.752
Ben.

22:01.138 --> 22:02.846
Thanks.

22:25.658 --> 22:28.991
I love you most
in the whole wide world, Mommy.

22:29.953 --> 22:33.652
Me too, sweetie. Come on, hold still.

22:46.382 --> 22:47.757
What's wrong, Mommy?

22:49.759 --> 22:52.428
Nothing, sweetie. Nothing.

22:53.679 --> 22:56.679
- Are we going for ice cream now?
- Yep.

22:56.848 --> 22:58.675
We're going for ice cream.

24:55.150 --> 24:56.560
Hi, Mommy.

25:01.654 --> 25:03.278
Can I have that ice cream now?

25:21.920 --> 25:24.078
Something's wrong with the kids
in this town.

25:24.255 --> 25:25.666
Yeah, tell me about it.

25:27.466 --> 25:30.383
So, what do you know
about changelings?

25:30.552 --> 25:33.671
- Evil monster babies?
- No, not necessarily babies.

25:34.138 --> 25:35.597
The kids.

25:35.765 --> 25:37.922
Creepy, stare-at-you-
like-you're-lunch kids?

25:38.100 --> 25:39.594
Yup.

25:41.102 --> 25:43.011
There's one at every victim's house.

25:46.481 --> 25:48.438
Changelings can
perfectly mimic children.

25:48.608 --> 25:51.395
According to lore, they climb
the window, snatch the kid.

25:51.569 --> 25:54.142
There were marks on the windowsill
at one house.

25:54.321 --> 25:55.483
Looked to me like blood.

25:55.655 --> 25:58.062
So changeling grabs the kid,
assumes its form...

25:58.241 --> 26:00.612
<i>...joins the happy fam. Just for kicks?</i>

26:00.784 --> 26:04.034
<i>Not quite.
Changelings feed on the mom.</i>

26:04.204 --> 26:06.030
<i>Synovial fluid.</i>

26:06.205 --> 26:09.787
<i>The moms have these odd bruises
on the back of their necks.</i>

26:15.086 --> 26:18.537
<i>Changelings can drain them for a few
weeks before Mom finally croaks.</i>

26:18.714 --> 26:20.753
And then there's Dad, the babysitter...

26:20.924 --> 26:24.756
Seems like anyone who gets between
a changeling and its food ends up dead.

26:24.928 --> 26:27.086
- Fire's the way to waste them? Great.
- Yep.

26:27.263 --> 26:30.097
Now, we'll just bust in,
drag the kids out, torch them.

26:30.265 --> 26:32.139
That'll play great with the neighbors.

26:32.308 --> 26:33.719
What about the real ones?

26:33.893 --> 26:36.218
According to lore,
they stash them underground.

26:36.395 --> 26:40.013
I don't know why, but if it's true,
real kids might be out there somewhere.

26:40.190 --> 26:41.897
Better start looking.

26:42.066 --> 26:45.565
So any kid
in the neighborhood's vulnerable?

26:45.736 --> 26:47.443
- Yup.
- We gotta make a stop.

26:47.612 --> 26:49.984
- I wanna check on someone.
- Lf the real kids are alive...

26:50.156 --> 26:51.780
...we don't have time to...
- We have to.

26:56.911 --> 26:58.619
- What are you...?
- I was thinking...

26:58.788 --> 27:01.622
...Ben's birthday, I didn't even bring
him a present.

27:01.790 --> 27:03.913
- That's okay.
- No, no. No, I feel terrible.

27:04.084 --> 27:06.242
So here.

27:06.919 --> 27:08.959
Take a long weekend.
Just the two of you.

27:09.129 --> 27:10.623
- On me.
- What?

27:10.797 --> 27:12.837
I hear Six Flags is great
this time of year.

27:13.008 --> 27:15.213
Go now, avoid the traffic. Heh.

27:15.593 --> 27:18.166
Siegfried Houdini. Whose card is this?

27:18.345 --> 27:19.625
Mine.

27:20.722 --> 27:23.213
Never mind. It'll work, I promise.

27:24.724 --> 27:26.467
- You should leave.
- Lisa.

27:26.642 --> 27:28.184
Mommy? What's wrong?

27:28.602 --> 27:30.641
Nothing, Ben, it's cool.

27:30.812 --> 27:33.433
Make him go away, Mommy.

27:38.485 --> 27:40.145
You heard him.

27:40.320 --> 27:43.107
- Get out.
- Lisa.

27:44.073 --> 27:46.646
- I don't think it's a good idea.
- Get out!

28:35.364 --> 28:36.906
They took Ben. He's changed.

28:37.073 --> 28:38.401
What? Are you sure?

28:38.574 --> 28:40.400
I'm sure. I checked his windowsill.

28:40.575 --> 28:42.817
- Blood?
- I don't think it is blood.

28:42.994 --> 28:44.986
I think I know where the kids are.

29:00.341 --> 29:01.799
Red dirt.

29:01.967 --> 29:03.627
That's what was on the window.

29:03.802 --> 29:06.637
You take the front. I'll go around.

30:29.536 --> 30:31.575
Ben? Ben. It's okay.

30:31.746 --> 30:33.655
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

30:36.750 --> 30:38.493
What do you think you're doing?

30:54.639 --> 30:57.212
This is private property.
I'm calling the police.

31:08.941 --> 31:12.025
- You heard me. Get out!
- Just let me get my bag. I'm going.

31:12.194 --> 31:13.652
I don't mean to cause any trouble.

31:20.200 --> 31:21.480
Mommy?

31:22.118 --> 31:23.529
- Ben.
- Play with me.

31:23.703 --> 31:25.909
This isn't funny.
I put you to bed three times.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.202
But I don't wanna go to bed.

31:30.792 --> 31:32.749
That's sweet, hon.

31:36.505 --> 31:37.833
Come on.

31:42.385 --> 31:43.464
All right. Come on.

31:43.636 --> 31:46.422
- I'm hungry.
- Mini pizzas okay?

31:46.596 --> 31:48.802
- Deluxe is all we've got.
- Okay.

31:48.973 --> 31:51.464
That's funny. I thought
we were anti-olives this month.

32:02.651 --> 32:05.320
It's okay.
You're gonna get out of here, all right?

32:09.323 --> 32:10.354
Hurry!

32:11.324 --> 32:12.866
Come on, girls. Come on.

32:13.034 --> 32:14.232
Come on.

32:14.410 --> 32:16.152
Come on. Come on.

32:16.703 --> 32:19.110
All right. Everybody back.
Everybody back.

32:20.247 --> 32:21.990
Cover your eyes! Uhn!

32:25.877 --> 32:28.118
Here. Use this.

32:30.463 --> 32:31.792
All right.

32:31.965 --> 32:33.542
- All right. Come on.
- Him first.

32:33.716 --> 32:36.004
Dean! Dean, there's a mother.

32:36.176 --> 32:38.714
- Mother changeling?
- Gotta get these kids out. Quick.

32:39.346 --> 32:42.595
Right there. There's one more.
You gotta break the lock.

32:42.765 --> 32:45.090
That's why changeling's keeping
the kids alive...

32:45.267 --> 32:46.725
...so Mom can snack on them.

32:48.686 --> 32:50.679
Come on. I got you.

32:53.982 --> 32:55.180
What's wrong, Mommy?

32:55.942 --> 32:57.566
- You're not my son.
- Yes, I am.

32:57.735 --> 32:59.395
- Where's Ben?
- I'm Ben.

33:00.487 --> 33:01.602
I love you, Mommy.

33:15.833 --> 33:18.668
They don't want you
to leave me, Mommy.

33:21.337 --> 33:24.006
Mommy? Mommy.

33:27.843 --> 33:29.917
Let me in!

33:30.886 --> 33:33.720
What are you doing? Let me in!

33:33.888 --> 33:36.176
Let me in, let me in, let me in!

34:00.159 --> 34:02.032
Ben, get them out of here!

34:42.358 --> 34:43.437
Mommy!

34:58.454 --> 34:59.533
Ben?

35:00.414 --> 35:01.612
Ben!

35:01.790 --> 35:03.581
Baby, are you okay?

35:03.750 --> 35:06.075
- I'm okay, Mom.
- Oh, my God.

35:11.506 --> 35:13.000
What the hell just happened?

35:13.174 --> 35:15.250
I'll explain everything
if you want me to...

35:15.426 --> 35:17.217
...but trust me, you probably don't.

35:17.386 --> 35:19.711
Important thing is is that Ben's safe.

35:21.055 --> 35:22.798
Thank you.

35:24.433 --> 35:26.141
Thank you.

35:29.270 --> 35:31.595
I'm gonna give you guys some time.

35:32.398 --> 35:34.189
Come on.

35:42.322 --> 35:44.315
Changelings?

35:45.783 --> 35:48.986
You know how I never mentioned
my job? This is my job.

35:49.662 --> 35:51.120
I so didn't wanna know that.

35:53.581 --> 35:55.240
Do you think he'll be okay?

35:55.415 --> 35:57.123
Yeah, I think he'll be fine.

35:58.376 --> 35:59.407
Okay, seriously.

35:59.585 --> 36:02.420
I mean, you're 100 percent sure
that he is not mine? Right?

36:02.587 --> 36:04.247
You're off the hook.
I did a blood test...

36:04.422 --> 36:06.130
...when he was a baby.
- Oh.

36:06.299 --> 36:09.334
There was this guy.
Some barback in a biker joint.

36:10.677 --> 36:12.716
What? I had a type.

36:13.263 --> 36:16.880
Leather jacket, couple of scars,
no mailing address, I was there.

36:18.267 --> 36:20.591
Guess I was a little wild back then.

36:21.644 --> 36:23.055
Before I became a mom.

36:24.396 --> 36:26.270
So yeah. You can relax.

36:28.191 --> 36:29.685
Good.

36:36.031 --> 36:37.359
You... I...

36:38.616 --> 36:40.324
I swear you look disappointed.

36:45.747 --> 36:47.538
Yeah, I don't know.

36:47.832 --> 36:52.125
It's weird, you know.
Your life, I mean, this house, the kid.

36:52.294 --> 36:55.460
It's not my life, never will be.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.714
Some stuff happened to me
recently and...

37:02.468 --> 37:05.801
Anyway, a guy in my situation,
you start to think, you know.

37:05.971 --> 37:07.299
I'm gonna be gone one day...

37:07.472 --> 37:10.258
...and what am I leaving behind
besides a car? Heh.

37:11.683 --> 37:13.225
I don't know.

37:13.393 --> 37:15.930
Ben may not be your kid...

37:16.562 --> 37:19.349
...but he wouldn't be alive
if it wasn't for you.

37:19.940 --> 37:21.517
That's a lot, if you ask me.

37:30.365 --> 37:32.571
You know, just for the record...

37:33.617 --> 37:34.732
...you got a great kid.

37:36.828 --> 37:38.737
I would have been proud
to be his dad.

37:50.547 --> 37:52.125
Look...

37:52.799 --> 37:55.468
...if you wanna stick around
for a while...

37:56.135 --> 37:57.629
...you're welcome to stay.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.383
I can't.

38:05.309 --> 38:06.637
I got a lot of work to do.

38:06.810 --> 38:08.435
And it's not my life.

38:25.116 --> 38:26.823
Hi, I needed to check some facts...

38:26.992 --> 38:29.613
...with your secretary...

38:29.786 --> 38:33.569
...about a fire that occurred
on November 24th, 2006...

38:33.747 --> 38:35.656
...in Lawrence, Kansas.

38:35.832 --> 38:38.584
Hardecker was his name. Okay. Great.

38:38.751 --> 38:40.542
Trying to find out the date he died.

38:40.711 --> 38:43.581
This is Police Chief Phil Jones.
July 13th.

38:43.755 --> 38:47.455
Can you check the records for me
for a Robert Campbell, July 19th, 2001.

38:48.092 --> 38:51.792
Dead on arrival.
What I'm after is, is cause of death.

38:51.970 --> 38:53.085
Heart condition?

38:53.263 --> 38:57.046
Wasn't he a cardiac surgeon?
Wouldn't he have known about that?

38:57.224 --> 39:00.842
<i>I'm looking for information
on Mrs. Wallace's death.</i>

39:01.019 --> 39:03.889
Two deaths. Who was the other?

39:04.439 --> 39:08.186
Ed Campbell? Any survivors?

39:08.358 --> 39:10.564
No, that's all I needed,
thank you very much.

39:14.905 --> 39:16.779
Oh, my God.

39:19.993 --> 39:21.700
They're dead.

39:22.411 --> 39:23.953
All of them.

39:24.871 --> 39:28.370
All of my mom's friends, her doctor,
her uncle.

39:28.541 --> 39:33.202
Everyone who knew her systematically
wiped off the map one at a time. Heh.

39:33.378 --> 39:37.291
Someone went through a hell of a lot
of trouble trying to cover their tracks.

39:37.714 --> 39:40.714
Yup. Yellow-Eyed Demon.

39:40.883 --> 39:42.128
So, what's your deal?

39:42.301 --> 39:45.800
You show up where I am, you know all
about me, you know all about my mom.

39:45.971 --> 39:47.630
Ha-ha. I already told you, I'm just...

39:47.805 --> 39:50.047
Oh, right. Right. Yeah, yeah.
Just a hunter.

39:50.224 --> 39:54.552
Just some hunter who happens to know
more about my own family than I do.

39:55.979 --> 39:57.805
Just tell me who you are.

39:57.980 --> 40:00.435
- Sam, it...
- Just...

40:00.941 --> 40:02.898
- Tell me who you are.
- It doesn't matter.

40:03.067 --> 40:05.605
Just tell me who you are!

40:10.865 --> 40:12.573
Fine.

40:16.537 --> 40:18.161
Think before going
for that holy water.

40:18.330 --> 40:20.571
- Give me one reason.
- I'm here to help you.

40:20.748 --> 40:24.911
- Is that some kind of joke?
- God's honest truth. Or whatever.

40:25.085 --> 40:27.576
- You're a demon.
- Don't be such a racist.

40:27.754 --> 40:30.244
I'm here because I wanna help you.

40:30.923 --> 40:33.793
And I can if you trust me.

40:33.967 --> 40:35.165
Trust you?

40:35.343 --> 40:36.718
Sam, calm down.

40:36.886 --> 40:40.800
Start talking. All those murders,
what was the demon trying to cover up?

40:40.973 --> 40:42.632
- I don't know.
- What happened to my mother?

40:42.807 --> 40:45.215
I honestly don't know.

40:45.393 --> 40:48.974
That's what I'm trying to find out.
All I know is that it's about you.

40:50.062 --> 40:51.686
What?

40:52.064 --> 40:54.934
Don't you get it, Sam?
It's all about you.

40:55.108 --> 40:56.934
What happened to your mom,
her friends.

40:57.109 --> 40:59.647
They're trying to cover up
what he did to you.

40:59.820 --> 41:01.362
I wanna help you figure it out.

41:01.530 --> 41:04.364
- Why would you wanna help me?
- I have my reasons.

41:04.866 --> 41:06.573
Not all demons are the same, Sam.

41:06.742 --> 41:09.315
Not all of us want the same thing.

41:09.494 --> 41:11.154
Me?

41:11.329 --> 41:13.072
I wanna help you from time to time.

41:13.247 --> 41:14.907
That's all.

41:18.043 --> 41:20.118
And if you let me, heh...

41:20.420 --> 41:22.376
...there's something in it for you.

41:22.880 --> 41:26.213
- What could you possibly...?
- I could help you save your brother.
