00:00.810 --> 00:02.211
-Previously on Empire...
-This is your scarf.

00:02.245 --> 00:04.180
You were wearing it the night
that you killed Shine.

00:04.213 --> 00:06.048
Withdraw your bid for Empire.

00:09.286 --> 00:13.089
-You just gave away Empire!
-I did it for that.

00:13.122 --> 00:15.024
-Why you packing?
-'Cause I'm leaving, Ma.

00:15.057 --> 00:16.526
I need to be nobody
for a minute.

00:16.559 --> 00:19.028
What did you do to me?

00:19.061 --> 00:21.898
-Karma's a bitch.
-(screams)

00:23.433 --> 00:25.635
(people screaming)

00:25.668 --> 00:27.136
I'm pregnant, and it's yours.

00:28.771 --> 00:30.973
Cookie, I want you
to be my wife.

00:31.007 --> 00:34.377
JUDGE: I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

00:34.411 --> 00:37.447
-Hakeem, he's got a gun!
-Dad, what are you doing?!

00:37.480 --> 00:39.782
-No!
-(gunshot)

00:39.816 --> 00:41.751
*

00:57.634 --> 00:59.502
*

01:25.328 --> 01:26.696
(sighs)

01:26.729 --> 01:28.665
*

01:40.510 --> 01:42.412
("Ibiza" playing over laptop)

01:49.251 --> 01:51.521
* Top down, feel the breeze

01:51.554 --> 01:53.556
* Chillin' with the homies
in Ibiza *

01:53.590 --> 01:56.192
* Pipe down, girl, please

01:56.225 --> 01:57.894
* Don't you see the camera?
Say "cheese" *

01:57.927 --> 02:00.196
* Whine down on me

02:00.229 --> 02:02.665
* Shake it like
some new car keys *

02:02.699 --> 02:04.534
* 'Cause right now, I might be *

02:04.567 --> 02:06.569
* 'Bout the flyest one
that you've ever seen *

02:06.603 --> 02:09.372
* I know you do it
for the culture *

02:09.406 --> 02:11.874
* Just come a little closer

02:11.908 --> 02:14.043
* Baby, we can do the most-a

02:14.076 --> 02:16.078
-Hey.
-* Right now, right now,
right now, right now *

02:16.112 --> 02:17.914
* Real money,
I ain't hood rich *

02:17.947 --> 02:20.550
* If you ain't a dummy,
go stupid *

02:20.583 --> 02:22.852
* I got the check, baby,
you can make it run up, run up *

02:22.885 --> 02:24.487
* Run up, run up

02:24.521 --> 02:27.189
* Oh, what we got now?

02:27.223 --> 02:29.392
* Whole thing shut down

02:29.426 --> 02:30.860
* Flames burn to the ground

02:30.893 --> 02:32.161
* Burn up, burn up,
burn up, burn up... *

02:32.194 --> 02:34.063
(music stops)

02:34.096 --> 02:36.399
(music fast-forwards, stops)

02:36.433 --> 02:38.568
(footsteps approaching)

02:38.601 --> 02:40.870
COOKIE:
Damn!

02:40.903 --> 02:43.706
It is hot as hell in here!

02:43.740 --> 02:47.009
Can't we get the AC fixed
or something?

02:47.043 --> 02:49.679
If you got $50,000.

02:49.712 --> 02:52.415
Bump that. I'll sweat it out.

02:52.449 --> 02:55.718
Well, don't forget,
I like you sweaty.

02:55.752 --> 02:58.054
You were supposed to meet me
at the network.

02:58.087 --> 03:01.624
We'd like Lucious to be a judge
on our musical talent show.

03:01.658 --> 03:03.726
We'll write a catchphrase
for Lucious, like, uh,

03:03.760 --> 03:08.030
"Welcome to the dog pound,"
or, uh, "Not now. Not ever."

03:08.064 --> 03:09.766
No, stupid. (chuckles)

03:09.799 --> 03:12.301
"No, stupid"? Yeah.
"No, stupid." I like that.

03:12.334 --> 03:13.870
(executives chuckling)

03:13.903 --> 03:15.605
"No, stupid." You see?
He's sitting there.

03:15.638 --> 03:17.740
He's... I like that.
That's pretty good.

03:17.774 --> 03:20.376
Had me up there looking stupid.

03:20.409 --> 03:22.645
I'm sorry. I-I just,
I can't think about anything

03:22.679 --> 03:26.082
like that until we...
until we get Empire back.

03:26.115 --> 03:28.250
Yeah, well, until then,
we got to stay afloat.

03:28.284 --> 03:30.653
-Now, I'm out here hustling.
-What do you see me doing?

03:30.687 --> 03:33.122
I'm over here
trying to edit this thing, look.

03:33.155 --> 03:35.992
We got millions of dollars
worth of footage

03:36.025 --> 03:39.696
that nobody in the world has;
we can cash in online.

03:41.531 --> 03:43.800
Look at our boy.

03:43.833 --> 03:46.769
You tell me Keem
wasn't meant to do this.

03:51.373 --> 03:54.644
Hmm, that's my baby.

03:54.677 --> 03:57.413
Look, Lucious, we don't have
time to do all of this, okay?

03:57.446 --> 03:59.916
You know how much stuff we got
to do before tomorrow night?

03:59.949 --> 04:02.451
Yeah, I haven't forgotten. We've
been planning it for two years.

04:02.485 --> 04:03.986
Eddie won't see it
coming either.

04:04.020 --> 04:05.822
-(laptop ringing)
-Ooh, Jamal.
-Ah.

04:05.855 --> 04:08.090
-What's up, y'all?
-Hey, baby.

04:08.124 --> 04:10.493
-LUCIOUS: You looking good, son.
-When you coming home, boy?

04:10.527 --> 04:12.161
Ma, London is my home.

04:12.194 --> 04:13.830
-How are you?
-I'm good.

04:13.863 --> 04:15.998
-Yeah, we're great, man.
-How'd you celebrate?

04:16.032 --> 04:17.600
-Celebrate what?
-Are you serious?

04:17.634 --> 04:19.836
Y'all two-year
wedding anniversary. Damn.

04:19.869 --> 04:21.604
-What?
-Uh, oh, we-we, um,

04:21.638 --> 04:23.172
we gonna celebrate this weekend.

04:23.205 --> 04:25.007
Look, how's your love life, huh?

04:25.041 --> 04:27.343
How's, uh, what's his name?

04:27.376 --> 04:29.946
-Ky-Kyle? Kylie? Kale?
-(laughs)

04:29.979 --> 04:32.549
You're so shady. You know good
and well that boy's name is Kai.

04:32.582 --> 04:35.184
I'd remember his name
if I met the boy.

04:35.217 --> 04:38.788
Look, on another note, um, son,
how's your label doing?

04:38.821 --> 04:41.824
Dad, I just signed this rapper
out of Dakar.

04:41.858 --> 04:43.626
(laughs):
He's so dope.

04:43.660 --> 04:45.662
I ain't making no money
or nothing, but whatever.

04:45.695 --> 04:46.896
-I love it.
-Really?

04:46.929 --> 04:49.198
Yeah, well, that sounds
more like a hobby than a job.

04:49.231 --> 04:50.700
I mean, if we could get Eddie

04:50.733 --> 04:52.134
to let you out of
your Empire contract...

04:52.168 --> 04:54.136
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

04:54.170 --> 04:55.972
Y'all up there
taking Eddie to court,

04:56.005 --> 04:57.674
trying to get Empire back;
I don't want none of that.

04:57.707 --> 04:59.976
-I'm good.
-(doorbell rings)

05:00.009 --> 05:01.143
Y'all expecting company?

05:01.177 --> 05:02.979
Uh, something like that.
(chuckles)

05:03.012 --> 05:04.881
JUANITA: Miss Cookie?
Those people are here.

05:04.914 --> 05:06.683
(mouths) Boy, we got to go.

05:06.716 --> 05:08.417
It better not be
another six weeks

05:08.450 --> 05:10.853
-before I hear from your ass.
-All right, I love y'all.

05:10.887 --> 05:13.556
-I love you, too.
-(door opens)

05:13.590 --> 05:16.425
Miss Cookie, my pay--
it's already been five weeks.

05:16.458 --> 05:17.860
COOKIE:
I know, I know.

05:17.894 --> 05:20.362
I got you, I got you,
Juanita, okay?

05:20.396 --> 05:22.832
Friday, I promise. Okay.

05:22.865 --> 05:26.435
(sighs)
We forgot our anniversary.

05:26.468 --> 05:27.770
I'm sorry, baby.

05:27.804 --> 05:30.940
I've just been so busy
trying to scratch out a living.

05:30.973 --> 05:32.274
Happy anniversary.

05:32.308 --> 05:34.043
-Happy annivers...
-(cart rolling)

05:34.076 --> 05:36.445
-Oh, no. Oh, my God.
-Wait.

05:36.478 --> 05:39.415
You said to sell it all,
Miss Cookie.

05:39.448 --> 05:41.618
I know, I know, I know,
but just...

05:41.651 --> 05:44.621
W-Wait, wait, wait.
Why don't you...

05:44.654 --> 05:46.623
wrap that up
and protect it first?

05:46.656 --> 05:49.458
Okay, hey, it's just things,
Lucious. It's just things.

05:49.491 --> 05:51.427
We're better than that.
Hey, put that back.

05:51.460 --> 05:53.730
That's-that's my Derrick Adams.

05:53.763 --> 05:55.431
Gift my husband gave me
for my wedding.

05:55.464 --> 05:57.133
Come here. Come on, baby.

05:57.166 --> 05:59.769
I'm so sick and tired of people
taking things from us.

05:59.802 --> 06:02.538
Now, we tried it the legal way.

06:02.571 --> 06:04.540
I think it's time
we-we got to plan.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.308
Let's go get what's ours.

06:10.079 --> 06:14.483
We get Eddie tomorrow night
at the awards ceremony,

06:14.516 --> 06:17.219
when his security aren't around.

06:17.253 --> 06:19.922
You talked to Andre?
He's gonna get us what we need?

06:19.956 --> 06:23.192
Andre's gonna deliver,
don't you worry about that.

06:26.963 --> 06:28.798
GUARD:
You got 15 minutes!

06:28.831 --> 06:30.166
(indistinct guard radio chatter)

06:30.199 --> 06:31.634
Better keep walking.

06:31.668 --> 06:34.103
-(inmates chattering)
-(weights clanking)

06:44.814 --> 06:46.716
*

06:58.895 --> 07:00.963
*

07:06.335 --> 07:07.937
LUCIOUS:
No, it don't make sense.

07:07.970 --> 07:10.006
I mean, he-he couldn't have
possibly known

07:10.039 --> 07:12.441
that she would fall;
he didn't mean to kill her.

07:12.474 --> 07:14.276
THIRSTY: Yeah, that's why
I got it reduced

07:14.310 --> 07:16.478
to reckless endangerment.

07:16.512 --> 07:19.115
-Two years, man.
-You know I did
everything I could.

07:19.148 --> 07:21.017
All right? This is
the best deal we're gonna get.

07:21.050 --> 07:22.618
Someone caught Andre
spiking Anika's drink

07:22.651 --> 07:25.387
-in a cell phone pic.
-COOKIE: No.

07:25.421 --> 07:27.389
I can handle two years, Ma.

07:27.423 --> 07:29.058
-No.
-You did 17.

07:29.091 --> 07:31.227
And that's why I went,
so you wouldn't have to.

07:31.260 --> 07:33.262
Thirsty got me a good deal, Ma.

07:34.764 --> 07:37.333
Hey. I can do this.

07:39.401 --> 07:43.139
You know why they transferred
you to this hellhole, Steve?

07:43.172 --> 07:45.474
(chuckles)

07:45.507 --> 07:47.176
It was because of me.

07:49.178 --> 07:53.249
Traded in a lot of favors
to get you here.

07:53.282 --> 07:55.651
What do you want?

07:55.684 --> 07:57.219
You were Eddie Barker's
money manager.

07:57.253 --> 07:59.655
You ran that Ponzi scheme
that brought him down.

07:59.688 --> 08:01.557
I didn't do it.

08:05.094 --> 08:07.263
I hope you did it, Steve.

08:07.296 --> 08:11.667
Because if you did,
you have access to what I need,

08:11.700 --> 08:14.336
and then I can get you
back to Club Fed.

08:14.370 --> 08:16.172
Home sweet home.

08:16.205 --> 08:22.044
But, Steve, if you didn't,
you're no use to me.

08:22.078 --> 08:24.413
And that is no good for you.

08:37.459 --> 08:39.395
*

08:47.236 --> 08:50.306
Up, up, up, up, up. No. Down.

08:50.339 --> 08:52.474
Down. Okay, yes.

08:52.508 --> 08:54.743
Right there.
Hold it right there.

08:54.777 --> 08:56.745
(exhales):
Whoa.

08:56.779 --> 08:58.480
-That was good.
-(exhales)

08:58.514 --> 09:00.316
That was good.

09:00.349 --> 09:03.285
-I like a woman
who knows what she wants.
-(laughs)

09:03.319 --> 09:07.056
I really needed that.
We make a good team, Kingsley.

09:07.089 --> 09:10.893
Great things in business
are never done by one person.

09:10.927 --> 09:13.762
Are you really quoting
Steve Jobs after sex?

09:13.796 --> 09:16.732
(chuckles) Aren't you
even a little concerned

09:16.765 --> 09:18.767
-about Eddie catching us?
-No.

09:18.801 --> 09:20.569
He's too busy test-driving
hotel mattresses

09:20.602 --> 09:21.971
with his new assistant.

09:22.004 --> 09:25.607
-So why'd you remarry him?
-Temporary insanity.

09:25.641 --> 09:27.443
Or temporary "strategery."

09:29.445 --> 09:32.681
Look, when Eddie gets tired of

09:32.714 --> 09:36.018
pretending to do actual work
around here, I'm taking over.

09:36.052 --> 09:39.288
You're still singing my praises
in Silicon Valley, right?

09:39.321 --> 09:41.157
I've been known
to sing a note or two.

09:41.190 --> 09:42.624
Good.

09:44.726 --> 09:46.362
So, Glasses, you could go ahead

09:46.395 --> 09:49.165
and confirm my lunch
with Zane's playlist people.

09:49.198 --> 09:50.666
-Thank you so much.
-Mm-hmm.

09:50.699 --> 09:53.135
Ponytail, can you set
a meeting with Eddie

09:53.169 --> 09:55.004
-about upping our radio budget?
-Mm-hmm.

09:55.037 --> 09:57.974
Thank you so much.
And, Man Bun...

09:58.007 --> 10:00.609
yesterday's photo shoot
looked like some weird, like,

10:00.642 --> 10:02.444
Rugrats porno, and I hated it.

10:02.478 --> 10:04.346
-And you need to do better,
and go get it done.
-Mm-hmm.

10:04.380 --> 10:06.715
Thank you. Merci beaucoup. Bye.

10:09.518 --> 10:13.189
Listen up, everybody.
I just got back the P&L reports.

10:13.222 --> 10:17.894
Empire's profits...
are all the way up.

10:17.927 --> 10:19.495
(all cheering)

10:19.528 --> 10:21.964
BECKY:
Yes! Okay, okay.

10:21.998 --> 10:23.299
'Cause that is
all four quarters;

10:23.332 --> 10:25.801
-that is a clean sweep.
-And what do we call that?

10:25.834 --> 10:28.804
BOTH:
Black Girl Magic.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.339
-Yes.
-Yes.

10:30.372 --> 10:32.074
We have to focus.

10:32.108 --> 10:34.376
We have to make sure
that "Ibiza" makes

10:34.410 --> 10:37.379
Best Original Song
at the MVP Movie Awards.

10:37.413 --> 10:39.581
Girl, you know I already
took care of that.

10:39.615 --> 10:41.918
-I basically stroked
everybody involved.
-(laughs)

10:41.951 --> 10:44.386
(whispers): I have carpal tunnel
in both wrists now.

10:44.420 --> 10:46.522
-You nasty. But I like it...
-I am.

10:46.555 --> 10:48.490
...because Eddie hates to lose.

10:48.524 --> 10:49.591
Uh, speaking of Eddie,

10:49.625 --> 10:51.894
he knows that his fellow
nominated producers,

10:51.928 --> 10:54.230
Cookie and Lucious, will be
there that night, too, right?

10:54.263 --> 10:57.766
Please. He knows. Besides,
we doubled up on security.

10:57.799 --> 11:00.002
Perfect. That is exactly
what I was getting after.

11:00.036 --> 11:01.904
And you know what,
I'm just really glad

11:01.938 --> 11:04.706
that "Ibiza's" getting
this kind of attention,

11:04.740 --> 11:06.442
because it was Hakeem
and Tiana's last song

11:06.475 --> 11:08.110
-before the shooting.
-Yeah.

11:08.144 --> 11:11.247
-I just really miss them.
-I know.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.616
*

11:20.456 --> 11:22.591
-(Hakeem grunts)
-BLAKE: No!

11:22.624 --> 11:24.026
-(car alarm wailing)
-(Hakeem coughs)

11:24.060 --> 11:25.061
(Bella crying)

11:25.094 --> 11:26.628
(gunshot)

11:31.100 --> 11:33.970
TIANA: Oh, my God.
Look at me, look at me.

11:34.003 --> 11:35.637
Hakeem, Hakeem.

11:35.671 --> 11:39.308
-Keem! Keem!
-Help! Help!

11:39.341 --> 11:42.378
-Help! Help!
-Help!

11:42.411 --> 11:44.380
Keem! Someone call an ambulance!

11:44.413 --> 11:47.816
(Hakeem coughing)

11:47.849 --> 11:49.218
(clears throat)

11:49.251 --> 11:50.953
-Oh, come on, now.
-(exhales)

11:50.987 --> 11:52.989
Put your mind to it.

11:53.022 --> 11:54.356
Take a deep breath in.

11:55.992 --> 11:57.593
(coughing)

11:57.626 --> 12:00.096
I can't. It hurt, lady.

12:00.129 --> 12:02.298
Hey, losing part of your lung
is tough,

12:02.331 --> 12:04.400
but getting your wind back
isn't impossible.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.068
Don't let some crazy guy's
bullet beat you.

12:06.102 --> 12:08.270
Leave me the hell alone!

12:08.304 --> 12:10.339
(Hakeem coughing)

12:12.141 --> 12:15.677
I think he needs a second.
Please, just give us a minute.

12:15.711 --> 12:18.014
(coughing)

12:18.047 --> 12:20.616
Come here, Bella.

12:20.649 --> 12:22.618
Can you take Bella and Prince
down to the park,

12:22.651 --> 12:24.186
and I'll be there
in a few minutes.

12:24.220 --> 12:26.922
-Okay. Come on, Prince.
-Thank you. (kisses)

12:26.955 --> 12:29.358
-Be good. See you in a second.
-Come on, Bella, let's go.

12:29.391 --> 12:31.593
Mommy will be down soon.

12:31.627 --> 12:33.229
(door closes)

12:35.231 --> 12:38.600
I know that this is hard...

12:38.634 --> 12:41.170
but you can do this.

12:41.203 --> 12:42.804
I thought that
getting back onstage

12:42.838 --> 12:45.041
would be good motivation
for you.

12:45.074 --> 12:47.976
I can't rap, Tee.
I can't hold it.

12:48.010 --> 12:49.978
You'll have a backing track.

12:50.012 --> 12:53.015
You mean lip sync?
My fans would drag me for life.

12:53.049 --> 12:56.352
No, your fans want to see you
back onstage.

12:56.385 --> 12:58.620
They're happy that you're alive.

12:58.654 --> 13:00.022
And you know I need to do this

13:00.056 --> 13:01.823
to get back on
Eddie's good side.

13:01.857 --> 13:04.060
Man, to hell with him and
his Steve Harvey-looking suits.

13:04.093 --> 13:06.895
-Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

13:06.928 --> 13:08.797
Look, Eddie full-on
sidelined me

13:08.830 --> 13:12.134
when he found out
that I was pregnant.

13:12.168 --> 13:17.806
I need to be back on that stage,
in front of the world.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.741
So all this mess can stop.

13:23.445 --> 13:26.048
But I need you
to do it with me.

13:26.082 --> 13:28.517
(sighs)

13:28.550 --> 13:30.018
Okay.

13:30.052 --> 13:31.953
Okay. For you.

13:38.560 --> 13:42.931
Yes, yes, Andre came through
like a champ.

13:42.964 --> 13:44.933
And we got everything we need.

13:44.966 --> 13:48.370
Mm-hmm. I'm on my way back
from the prison now.

13:48.404 --> 13:52.174
Okay, take care.
I'll talk to you soon, babe.

13:52.208 --> 13:53.442
WOMAN:
* They be like, no

13:53.475 --> 13:55.244
* We never seen a chick
so cold *

13:55.277 --> 13:57.012
* Never seen a chain so gold

13:57.045 --> 13:58.747
* Never seen a wrist so froze

13:58.780 --> 14:00.716
* Diamonds on my neck all glow

14:00.749 --> 14:02.918
* So cold

14:02.951 --> 14:04.686
* So

14:04.720 --> 14:06.122
* Shining my light,
I'm the best *

14:06.155 --> 14:07.723
* Never seen nobody like me.

14:07.756 --> 14:09.525
PORSHA:
Cook. Come on, we got to go

14:09.558 --> 14:11.860
-if you want to get
to the awards on time.
-Okay.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.862
And you better not
turn on that driving app.

14:13.895 --> 14:16.098
I'm not paying all them
damn high surging prices.

14:16.132 --> 14:18.800
No, I'm not getting up there.

14:20.269 --> 14:21.970
Porsha, you're doing too much.

14:22.003 --> 14:24.873
This damn car look like
a circus. And fluffy.

14:24.906 --> 14:26.875
-I...
-Come on! I don't wanna hear it!

14:26.908 --> 14:28.977
("Mi Gente" by J Balvin
and Willy William playing)

14:29.010 --> 14:31.180

14:36.084 --> 14:38.387
(lively chatter)

14:38.420 --> 14:39.755
(growls playfully)

14:42.491 --> 14:45.327
-Hey, Lucious!
-Cookie, right here!

14:45.361 --> 14:47.329
Who are you wearing?

14:47.363 --> 14:49.765
*

14:51.667 --> 14:52.601
Hi.

14:54.170 --> 14:56.138
REPORTER:
You two look fabulous.

14:56.172 --> 14:57.673
Seems like retirement is
treating you well.

14:57.706 --> 15:01.510
Yeah, well, you know,
we were, uh, docking our yacht

15:01.543 --> 15:04.780
when we got the info
about the nomination.

15:04.813 --> 15:06.782
(laughs) I love it.

15:06.815 --> 15:08.850
Now, Lucious, we know
you and Eddie Barker

15:08.884 --> 15:10.819
have had some legal tussles
over Empire.

15:10.852 --> 15:12.954
Where do you stand now?

15:12.988 --> 15:15.957
Oh, you know, um,
people squabble,

15:15.991 --> 15:18.994
but at the end of the day,
blood is thicker than water.

15:19.027 --> 15:20.862
He's always gonna be
my brother.

15:20.896 --> 15:22.531
Okay. All right, then, thanks.

15:22.564 --> 15:26.768
And you heard it
from the Lyon's mouth.

15:26.802 --> 15:30.506
-Look at how scared of us he is.
-He should be.

15:30.539 --> 15:32.708
(chuckles) Punk bitch.

15:32.741 --> 15:34.743
-WOMAN: Cookie! Hey, girl!
-Hi.

15:40.982 --> 15:43.985
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

15:44.019 --> 15:45.521
That dress is beautiful.

15:45.554 --> 15:46.955
Who makes it, Balmain?

15:46.988 --> 15:49.991
*

15:50.025 --> 15:51.793
Listen, Cookie,
I just want you to know

15:51.827 --> 15:54.363
that I would have handled things
differently than Eddie.

15:54.396 --> 15:56.164
(chuckles)

15:56.198 --> 15:58.500
Do you think I care

15:58.534 --> 16:01.370
what Eddie's ho
would have done differently?

16:01.403 --> 16:02.871
Girl...

16:02.904 --> 16:05.006
(scoffs)

16:05.040 --> 16:07.142
You know, you should be careful
with the pit stains.

16:07.175 --> 16:09.211
H&M won't take that back.

16:11.580 --> 16:13.549
Too bad you can't
get your money back

16:13.582 --> 16:15.417
for that botched face job.

16:15.451 --> 16:19.087
I can think of somewhere else
you could've used the money.

16:20.922 --> 16:22.891
Can I get champagne?

16:22.924 --> 16:25.994

Best Original Song.

What happened? How's our boy?

18:22.711 --> 18:24.279
Uh... (chuckles)

18:24.312 --> 18:27.449
Well, his ego is bruised, but
the doctor said he'll be okay.

18:27.483 --> 18:30.686
If we could just have the
nominees, please, no security.

18:30.719 --> 18:32.320

Oh.

Sir, your category's coming up
after the commercial break.

We need all the nominees
together for the camera shot.

19:35.417 --> 19:36.952
Oh.

19:36.985 --> 19:40.422
I just wanted to know
why you betrayed Empire.

19:40.456 --> 19:43.091
-Betrayed by raising revenues?
-(scoffs)

19:43.124 --> 19:44.893

Yeah, your money guy told us
that's where you keep

20:13.955 --> 20:16.291
your secret shell company
accounts.

20:16.324 --> 20:18.326
Yeah, money disappears
from Empire,

20:18.359 --> 20:22.063
and then, poof, it ends up
in your Panama account.

20:22.097 --> 20:23.565
-Can't prove it, right?
-Oh, yeah.

20:23.599 --> 20:26.334

20:59.467 --> 21:02.037
And nominated for "Ibiza,"

21:02.070 --> 21:05.641
Lucious Lyon, Cookie Lyon
and Eddie Barker.

21:05.674 --> 21:07.442
-(applause)
-* Oh, what we got now

21:07.475 --> 21:09.778
* Whole thing shut down...

21:09.811 --> 21:13.148
We'll expect a call
from Kelly Patel tomorrow.

21:13.181 --> 21:16.985
And the winner is...

21:17.018 --> 21:18.620
"Ibiza"!

21:18.654 --> 21:22.323
Lucious Lyon, Cookie Lyon
and Eddie Barker.

21:22.357 --> 21:23.458
-(crowd cheering)
-("Ibiza" playing)

21:23.491 --> 21:24.626
Showtime, baby.

21:24.660 --> 21:26.695
* Flames burn to the ground

21:26.728 --> 21:28.764
* Burn up, burn up,
burn up, burn up. *

21:30.666 --> 21:32.568
(shredder whirring)

21:40.075 --> 21:43.912
So, why'd you just leave me
backstage at the awards?

21:43.945 --> 21:45.480
(slurring):
As you can see,

21:45.513 --> 21:47.482
I had some urgent business
to take care of.

21:47.515 --> 21:49.050
What are you, drunk?

21:51.519 --> 21:53.488
(sighs) A little.

21:53.521 --> 21:56.524
(laughs) Maybe a little more
than a little.

21:56.558 --> 21:59.160
So you're stepping down now?

21:59.194 --> 22:00.862
Not gonna give me any warning?

22:00.896 --> 22:02.631
What's going on, Eddie?

22:04.766 --> 22:06.534
(whispers):
We lost.

22:10.305 --> 22:12.273
We lost what?

22:12.307 --> 22:14.009
Everything.

22:14.042 --> 22:17.579
The Lyons discovered
my little indiscretion.

22:17.613 --> 22:20.749
(chuckles) They want
to give me the option

22:20.782 --> 22:24.319
of, like, going to prison or...

22:26.454 --> 22:28.456
...letting them
take over Empire.

22:28.489 --> 22:32.427
Eddie, what did you do?

22:32.460 --> 22:34.362
-How unoriginal is that?
-What did you do?

22:34.395 --> 22:35.631
Seriously? Think about it.

22:35.664 --> 22:37.465
What did you do?

22:37.498 --> 22:41.369
It's okay. Doesn't matter.

22:41.402 --> 22:43.038
What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

22:43.071 --> 22:46.274
-We lost.
-No, no. We didn't lose.

22:46.307 --> 22:49.645
Not "we," "you." You lost.

22:49.678 --> 22:52.881
Tomato, tomahto.

22:52.914 --> 22:55.550
Potato, potahto.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.953
(scoffs):
You really...

22:59.621 --> 23:01.757
Let me tell you something;
I didn't work this hard

23:01.790 --> 23:03.224
to lose everything again.

23:03.258 --> 23:05.460
-Not everything.
-I'm not playing...

23:05.493 --> 23:10.966
You been, like, uh, putting away
a little stash of money.

23:10.999 --> 23:13.134
Couple million, at least.
Use that to stay afloat.

23:13.168 --> 23:15.303
Look, you're not gonna take
all this away from me.

23:15.336 --> 23:17.405
They're not gonna
take it from me.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.274
-I'm the one that's been
running Empire.
-(laughs)

23:19.307 --> 23:21.643
While you just walk around here
like you've been running it.

23:21.677 --> 23:24.145
-I made it a success.
-Come on. Are you serious?

23:24.179 --> 23:25.781
You-- really?

23:25.814 --> 23:28.183
You wasn't running
any a damn well thing.

23:28.216 --> 23:30.585
You should be happy that
you still... half of your looks,

23:30.618 --> 23:33.488
-so you can still ride
on my coattails.
-Okay.

23:33.521 --> 23:36.591
Hold on.

23:36.624 --> 23:40.028
You're right. I'm sorry.
You were running it, baby.

23:40.061 --> 23:41.529
No. Just get off me.

23:41.562 --> 23:43.631
-Come here. Come here.
-Hey.

23:43.665 --> 23:44.833
-Just...
-Hey, whoa, whoa. Stop.

23:44.866 --> 23:46.167
-No, don't you touch me.
-No, like, come on.

23:46.201 --> 23:47.502
-Don't touch me, Eddie.
-Like, you look so pretty.

23:47.535 --> 23:48.937
-I said get off me!
-What's going on?

23:48.970 --> 23:50.772
-What are you doing?
-Get off me!

23:50.806 --> 23:53.041
-(loud thud)
-(gasps)

23:55.010 --> 23:57.145
Eddie.

23:57.178 --> 23:59.514
Okay. Drunk ass.

23:59.547 --> 24:02.183
Help me. I need help.

24:02.217 --> 24:03.819
Help. Help me.

24:10.558 --> 24:12.493
I'm sorry.

24:18.533 --> 24:21.069
I can't help you anymore, Eddie.

24:27.075 --> 24:29.010
*

24:53.134 --> 24:55.070
(shouting)

24:56.404 --> 24:59.274
Lucious! Lucious!

24:59.307 --> 25:01.709
Stop it, Lucious! Stop!

25:01.743 --> 25:03.779
We had his ass!

25:03.812 --> 25:06.681
We had his ass, and then
he gonna turn around and croak?

25:06.714 --> 25:09.684
I know, I know, and he's in hell
right now laughing at us

25:09.717 --> 25:11.519
in that yellow suit.

25:11.552 --> 25:13.088
My God.

25:13.121 --> 25:15.757
And our deal is just
as dead as he is. I know.

25:15.791 --> 25:17.759
What are we gonna do, huh?

25:17.793 --> 25:20.228
We should've never
gave up Empire.

25:20.261 --> 25:22.964
You should've never
gave it away.

25:22.998 --> 25:25.967
I did that to save
your ass from prison.

25:26.001 --> 25:27.435
You think they could've
kept me in there?

25:27.468 --> 25:29.070
What are you, Houdini, huh?

25:29.104 --> 25:31.272
-You was gonna magically
disappear? Escape?
-No.

25:31.306 --> 25:34.575
You're supposed to trust me.
You should've had faith in me!

25:34.609 --> 25:37.212
But you always walking around
here like you got balls

25:37.245 --> 25:39.480
that's bigger than
every-damn-body else.

25:39.514 --> 25:42.317
-You don't!
-Oh. So I'm supposed to bow down

25:42.350 --> 25:44.652
behind you 'cause
you the man, huh?

25:44.685 --> 25:48.723
Lucious, is your ego
that fragile?

25:48.756 --> 25:51.559
You think this is about ego?
This is about my dream.

25:51.592 --> 25:54.996
Empire was my destiny, Cookie.
It was my legacy!

25:55.030 --> 25:57.132
You, you, you!
Everything is you!

25:57.165 --> 25:58.666
-Yeah, 'cause this is about me!
-Oh, okay.

25:58.699 --> 26:00.135
-So I didn't help?
-Empire was mine!

26:00.168 --> 26:02.737
-I didn't help? I didn't help?
-Yeah. What did you do?

26:02.770 --> 26:04.572
I mean, where were you
most of the damn time?

26:04.605 --> 26:06.741
-(chuckles)
-You weren't there
when I built the damn thing.

26:06.774 --> 26:08.343
By the time you got back,

26:08.376 --> 26:11.279
Empire was
a multibillion-dollar business!

26:11.312 --> 26:13.448
You have a very short memory,

26:13.481 --> 26:17.485
Mr. Dwight I Can't Do Music,
Please See My Colors!

26:17.518 --> 26:20.155
You gonna go there...

26:20.188 --> 26:22.290
-Yeah, I'm-a go there!
I'm going there!
-Okay.

26:22.323 --> 26:24.425
All right, Cookie, so maybe
you helped me one time.

26:24.459 --> 26:26.427
-One time, Negro? One time?!
-One time.

26:26.461 --> 26:28.329
-Negro, please. One time?
-One time you helped me!
One time!

26:28.363 --> 26:31.833
-One time?!
-Hello?

26:31.867 --> 26:34.169
(screams)
Jamal? What are you doing here?!

26:34.202 --> 26:37.805
(both laugh)

26:37.839 --> 26:39.640
-Yay.
-You look amazing.

26:39.674 --> 26:41.709
-Uh, stunning.
-COOKIE: Hi.

26:41.742 --> 26:44.112
-Oh, this is, this is Kai.
-Yeah.

26:44.145 --> 26:45.847
-Yes. Hi, Kai. How are you?
-(Kai chuckles)

26:45.881 --> 26:48.783
Thrilled to meet you.
Jamal talks about you every day.

26:48.816 --> 26:51.352
-He better. Shoot, he don't know
how to pick up the phone.
-Ow.

26:51.386 --> 26:53.321
Hey, Dad.

26:53.354 --> 26:55.223
Hey, son.
I'm-I'm sorry I'm sweaty.

26:55.256 --> 26:58.293
-You are. What you got...?
-Forgive me.

26:58.326 --> 27:01.329
-Mr. Lyon, it's a pleasure, sir.
-Uh, no, pleasure's mine.

27:01.362 --> 27:04.399
You're a remarkable reporter,
I mean, impressive stuff.

27:04.432 --> 27:06.134
You go to
dangerous places, man.

27:06.167 --> 27:09.170
-You're the one
who's been watching?
-(laughter)

27:09.204 --> 27:11.806
It's nice to know I'm not
risking my life for nothing.

27:11.839 --> 27:15.911
Well, look, I... I wanted
the family to meet Kai.

27:15.944 --> 27:18.346
-Yes.
-Figured, you know,
since Dre is getting out soon,

27:18.379 --> 27:21.049
it was the perfect time.
Why is it so damn hot in here?

27:21.082 --> 27:24.052
Uh, 'cause we conserving energy,
child. (laughs)

27:24.085 --> 27:26.354
-So y'all gonna stay with us?
-Uh, nah, nah, nah, we gonna,

27:26.387 --> 27:30.191
um, chill at my place, 'cause
I didn't know that y'all were,

27:30.225 --> 27:31.893
-um, renovating and stuff.
-Mm-hmm.

27:31.927 --> 27:33.594
-We're not.
-We are.

27:33.628 --> 27:35.830
I need to step out
and make a call.

27:35.863 --> 27:37.765
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

27:39.267 --> 27:40.368
(door opens)

27:41.937 --> 27:44.272
(door closes)

27:49.810 --> 27:52.547
The hell is going on, y'all?

27:54.715 --> 27:56.584
What happened to the house?

27:59.487 --> 28:02.257
So Empire's gone?

28:02.290 --> 28:04.960
It's just no more? That's it?

28:07.996 --> 28:09.965
Well, praise the Lord.

28:09.998 --> 28:11.799
Praise Jehovah.

28:11.832 --> 28:14.602
Praise Allah. Praise Oshun.

28:14.635 --> 28:16.972
Shoot, praise Zeus,
praise all of the gods.

28:17.005 --> 28:18.473
-Really, Jamal?
-Yes, Ma, I'm serious.

28:18.506 --> 28:20.808
You know what?
The evil king is dead.

28:20.841 --> 28:22.978
So long live
the new king and queen.

28:23.011 --> 28:25.613
-I don't want to hear
none of this.
-No, Dad, listen, man. Come on.

28:25.646 --> 28:27.248
Y'all spent 20 years

28:27.282 --> 28:29.951
building something that
literally ate y'all alive.

28:29.985 --> 28:32.153
Then you lose it,

28:32.187 --> 28:34.822
and you spend two more years
trying to get it back.

28:34.855 --> 28:37.558
You hocking silverware, you...

28:37.592 --> 28:40.495
selling the art that you love
off of your walls.

28:40.528 --> 28:44.265
You're in this hot-ass house.

28:44.299 --> 28:46.634
That's not a dream,
that's a drug.

28:46.667 --> 28:48.636
You can't hold on
to what hurts you.

28:48.669 --> 28:50.838
Let it go.

28:50.871 --> 28:55.176
I don't know two people that
are more dynamic and creative,

28:55.210 --> 28:58.446
so if anybody's gonna build
magic from scratch,

28:58.479 --> 29:01.282
it's gonna be y'all.

29:01.316 --> 29:04.585
-(door closes)
-(sighs)

29:04.619 --> 29:06.587
Oh.

29:06.621 --> 29:10.325
So you finally decided to bring
your ass back up in here, huh?

29:12.393 --> 29:15.163
Hey, Hakeem, how you feeling?

29:15.196 --> 29:16.797
Your lungs still
coughing up blood

29:16.831 --> 29:20.201
from trying to do
my song last night?

29:20.235 --> 29:21.836
Hmm. You got your trophy.

29:21.869 --> 29:24.605
Ain't like you care
about anything else.

29:24.639 --> 29:26.707
(scoffs)

29:27.808 --> 29:29.377
I need another drink.

29:29.410 --> 29:32.180
Hakeem, staying out late
and getting drunk

29:32.213 --> 29:35.483
and getting into fights is not
gonna solve your problems, okay?

29:35.516 --> 29:37.118
-Who you yelling at, Tee?!
-You!

29:37.152 --> 29:40.488
Daddy? Tata?
Why are you shouting?

29:40.521 --> 29:42.690
Hey, babe. High-five.

29:42.723 --> 29:45.193
Look.

29:45.226 --> 29:48.629
Daddy and Tata are just
having a big person talk.

29:48.663 --> 29:50.231
I want you to go
back in the playroom

29:50.265 --> 29:52.633
and play with your toys.

29:52.667 --> 29:54.569
I love you.

29:58.039 --> 29:59.974
Listen.

30:00.007 --> 30:04.545
I need some space
to get myself together.

30:09.784 --> 30:11.786
-(sighs heavily)
-(fan buzzing)

30:18.526 --> 30:22.930
You gonna get a big fat gut,
all that stress eating.

30:22.963 --> 30:25.100
Who cares? It's good.

30:28.803 --> 30:32.039
Well, what about
what Jamal said?

30:32.073 --> 30:36.111
What about what he said?
I mean, look, baby, you...

30:36.144 --> 30:38.113
you can't just make
something happen

30:38.146 --> 30:40.081
just 'cause you want it
to happen.

30:40.115 --> 30:43.084
-It just don't work like that.
-Well, what do you want, huh?

30:43.118 --> 30:45.052
Do you want something new
to happen?

30:45.086 --> 30:48.689
I worked...

30:48.723 --> 30:50.258
We worked...

30:52.093 --> 30:56.964
...so hard and scarified
so much trying to build Empire.

30:56.997 --> 30:58.933
Last I checked, we ain't dead.

31:01.469 --> 31:05.240
But we can't start no label
unless you got some money.

31:05.273 --> 31:07.475
(chuckles softly)
Broke?

31:07.508 --> 31:09.944
Broke ain't ever
stopped us before.

31:09.977 --> 31:11.712
Don't you remember?

31:11.746 --> 31:14.882
For the longest, you were
the only artist at the label,

31:14.915 --> 31:16.451
and look what we've become.

31:16.484 --> 31:19.720
-Chocolate or vanilla?
-(sighs) Chocolate. Look.

31:19.754 --> 31:22.056
All my life, all I wanted
to do was music, Lucious,

31:22.089 --> 31:24.259
and I want to do it
with you, okay?

31:24.292 --> 31:27.128
I mean, if we gonna fly,
then we golden.

31:27.162 --> 31:30.331
But if we gonna fail,
we gonna fall to our own song.

31:30.365 --> 31:32.233
(drawer opens, closes)

31:32.267 --> 31:37.838
What we need is a new sound,
something unexpected, like...

31:37.872 --> 31:41.609
when people heard N.W.A.,
Whitney or Prince

31:41.642 --> 31:43.278
for the first time, you know?

31:43.311 --> 31:45.613
Them them old school heads, man.

31:45.646 --> 31:49.217
Yes, old school
with a new sound.

31:58.659 --> 32:01.362
But that's like trying to find
a needle in a haystack.

32:01.396 --> 32:05.233
You need somebody that just
drops you dead in your tracks.

32:10.571 --> 32:12.807
(laughs softly)

32:12.840 --> 32:14.675
Lucious.

32:16.143 --> 32:17.812
I think I found someone.

32:23.050 --> 32:25.786
-(door buzzes)
-COOKIE:
She must've been in here

32:25.820 --> 32:27.988
visiting her boyfriend
or her brother or something.

32:28.022 --> 32:30.858
Look, you got to help me
find this girl, okay?

32:30.891 --> 32:32.860
Ask a brother in here
about his woman?

32:32.893 --> 32:34.295
You trying to get me killed?

32:34.329 --> 32:37.164
Don't even play
like that, Andre.

32:37.198 --> 32:39.900
Look...

32:39.934 --> 32:43.204
the closer it comes
to you getting out of here,

32:43.238 --> 32:45.373
haters gonna come
out the woodwork.

32:45.406 --> 32:47.675
-Ma...
-Don't you let nothing or nobody

32:47.708 --> 32:51.679
get in the way of you coming
home, 'cause I need you.

32:51.712 --> 32:54.515
I hear you, Mom. Okay?

32:54.549 --> 32:56.251
-Okay.
-Don't worry.

32:56.284 --> 32:58.018
All right.

32:58.052 --> 33:01.922
But while you in here, keep
an eye out for me for this girl.

33:01.956 --> 33:04.292
I need to find out who she is.

33:06.927 --> 33:09.230
Uh, who-who is that?

33:11.198 --> 33:13.434
Social worker.

33:13.468 --> 33:15.503
Can I help you, ma'am?

33:15.536 --> 33:17.438
What's your name?

33:19.907 --> 33:23.210
-Um, Treasure.
-Treasure.

33:23.244 --> 33:25.079
I'm Cookie Lyon.

33:26.881 --> 33:28.483
I'm gonna change your life.

33:42.129 --> 33:44.064
KELLY:
It was a beautiful service.

33:47.134 --> 33:49.770
-I hate to talk business
right now...
-It's okay.

33:49.804 --> 33:52.072
...but I can't afford to let
a ship as big as Empire

33:52.106 --> 33:54.108
float along without a captain.

33:54.141 --> 33:56.544
Yeah.

33:56.577 --> 34:01.081
I'd like you to step in
as Empire's interim CEO.

34:03.518 --> 34:05.386
Wow.

34:05.420 --> 34:07.822
I can't think of a better way
to honor Eddie's legacy.

34:07.855 --> 34:09.223
(sniffles)

34:09.256 --> 34:11.726
Perfect. We'll talk tomorrow.

34:11.759 --> 34:14.128
-Yes.
-Okay.

34:14.161 --> 34:16.096
Thank you.

34:16.130 --> 34:18.098
Take Mrs. Barker home, please.

34:18.132 --> 34:21.035
("I Like That"
by Janelle Monáe playing)

34:32.480 --> 34:35.082
-Excuse me, sir.
-DRIVER: Yes, ma'am.

34:35.115 --> 34:37.251
In the next block,
can you just pull over

34:37.284 --> 34:39.820
-for a moment, please?
-No problem.

34:39.854 --> 34:41.255
Thank you.

34:41.288 --> 34:43.190
*

34:50.064 --> 34:51.432
* I don't really give a ... *

34:51.466 --> 34:54.234
* If I was just the only one
who likes that... *

34:56.637 --> 34:59.540
Okay.

34:59.574 --> 35:01.376
* The chase is on

35:01.409 --> 35:05.480
* Oh, me, oh, me, oh, me,
oh, my... *

35:05.513 --> 35:08.215
Wow. (chuckles)

35:08.248 --> 35:10.217
* Oh, me, oh, me, oh, me,
oh, my *

35:10.250 --> 35:11.452
(sighs)

35:11.486 --> 35:14.555
* I like that.

35:14.589 --> 35:16.857
COOKIE:
Okay, here we go.

35:16.891 --> 35:19.394
Right this way. (chuckles)

35:19.427 --> 35:20.561
Hey, hey.

35:23.197 --> 35:25.566
And who's this?

35:25.600 --> 35:27.167
Manager.

35:27.201 --> 35:30.137
COOKIE: (chuckles) Well,
you know, have a seat, honey.

35:30.170 --> 35:32.072
Um, don't mind the mess.
We are renovating.

35:32.106 --> 35:34.241
Oh, no, it's beautiful.

35:34.274 --> 35:35.643
I like how you like
to keep it toasty in here...

35:35.676 --> 35:37.077
Yeah, it's for the throat,
child. Sit down.

35:37.111 --> 35:38.846
Uh, do you want
anything to drink?

35:38.879 --> 35:40.981
I'll have a vodka tonic,
two cubes.

35:41.015 --> 35:43.350
You know, you people are lucky

35:43.384 --> 35:45.185
that you found my client
when you did.

35:45.219 --> 35:46.821
LUCIOUS:
Wow. I mean...

35:46.854 --> 35:48.756
"us people,"
we weren't even aware

35:48.789 --> 35:52.026
that Treasure
had representation.

35:52.059 --> 35:54.895
Oh, Treasure's been
one of my girls for a long time.

35:54.929 --> 35:57.532
-One of your girls?
-Yeah, I put a lot of time

35:57.565 --> 35:59.734
and money into
this one's career.

35:59.767 --> 36:03.538
Now, look here. Cookie said
that, uh, she heard you

36:03.571 --> 36:06.407
-freestyling in the car.
-Yeah.

36:06.441 --> 36:08.342
So we wondered
what you would sound like

36:08.375 --> 36:10.344
in front of a microphone.

36:10.377 --> 36:13.113
Yeah. Uh, did you write
that song in the car?

36:13.147 --> 36:15.282
-Yeah.
-Why don't you sing that.

36:15.315 --> 36:16.917
Okay.

36:16.951 --> 36:18.619
LUCIOUS:
You ever, um,

36:18.653 --> 36:20.921
-sang into a mic before?
-No, I...

36:20.955 --> 36:23.090
Hey, hey, uh...
do some scales first.

36:23.123 --> 36:26.293
And-and the breathing exercises
I taught you, okay?

36:26.326 --> 36:28.729
(breathing rhythmically)

36:28.763 --> 36:30.598
Joe, no, I-I don't need
to do that. It's okay.

36:30.631 --> 36:34.535
Hey, do what I say, Treasure.
And no back talk. (chuckles)

36:34.569 --> 36:37.304
Yeah, I mean, she's hopeless
if she can't find her breath.

36:37.337 --> 36:39.640
You know? These ghetto kids
with no training.

36:39.674 --> 36:41.141
-(laughs): I tell ya.
-Uh...

36:41.175 --> 36:42.409
LUCIOUS:
You know what?

36:42.443 --> 36:44.579
Um, why don't you and Cookie,

36:44.612 --> 36:47.982
y'all just get comfortable
and get acclimated in there.

36:48.015 --> 36:50.785
You and me, we go, um, out back,
talk about some business?

36:50.818 --> 36:52.620
Oh, I like the sound of that.
(chuckles)

36:52.653 --> 36:54.789
Yes.

36:54.822 --> 36:56.223
Come on, man.

36:56.256 --> 36:58.292
-After you.
-COOKIE: Yeah, we gonna vocalize

36:58.325 --> 37:00.127
and we'll have your drink ready
when you get back,

37:00.160 --> 37:02.930
with the two ice cubes.

37:06.133 --> 37:08.402
-(Treasure sighs)
-(door opens)

37:08.435 --> 37:10.738
-(elevator bell dings)
-But you're not mad
that you came, though?

37:10.771 --> 37:11.972
No, of course not.

37:12.006 --> 37:13.508
Look, I'm not gonna let anything
interfere with us,

37:13.541 --> 37:15.009
not even my crazy-ass family.

37:15.042 --> 37:17.311
I know. Besides, before you know
it, we'll be back in London.

37:17.344 --> 37:19.413
-You damn right we will.
-All right, where do you
want me to put these at?

37:19.446 --> 37:21.816
Who the hell are you
and why you here?!

37:21.849 --> 37:23.484
-JAMAL: What the hell are you
doing, Keem?! Put that down!
-I'm calling the police.

37:23.518 --> 37:24.952
-He just put a gun to my head.
-Okay.

37:24.985 --> 37:26.854
And we in the States, and they
use us for target practice.

37:26.887 --> 37:28.989
Who he?

37:29.023 --> 37:30.958
He is my boyfriend Kai.

37:30.991 --> 37:33.360
I told you about him.

37:33.393 --> 37:35.429
'Sup?

37:35.462 --> 37:39.634
'Sup? I don't much appreciate
guns being pulled on me.

37:39.667 --> 37:42.903
Relax, it ain't even loaded.

37:46.974 --> 37:49.810
It's a beauty.

37:49.844 --> 37:51.746
May I see it?

38:03.524 --> 38:05.726
You missed the one
in the chamber.

38:05.760 --> 38:07.562
Common, deadly mistake.

38:07.595 --> 38:09.063
JAMAL:
Yeah.

38:12.399 --> 38:14.001
What is this, Hakeem?

38:14.034 --> 38:16.136
(sighs)
Going through a rough patch.

38:16.170 --> 38:18.539
I ain't even know
you was gonna be here.

38:18.573 --> 38:20.641
Maybe you would if you actually
would've answered my texts.

38:20.675 --> 38:22.743
HAKEEM: Look, my bad.
I got a new number.

38:22.777 --> 38:24.545
-I really need a place to crash.
-You know that

38:24.579 --> 38:25.913
you can stay here
any time that you want.

38:25.946 --> 38:27.582
But what the hell
is all of this?

38:27.615 --> 38:29.650
What the hell are these guns,
man? What are you going through?

38:29.684 --> 38:31.719
-What are you even thinking?
-Who you screaming at, bruh?!

38:31.752 --> 38:34.321
I'm screaming at you.

38:34.354 --> 38:35.923
You my little brother
and I'm worried about you.

38:35.956 --> 38:37.524
Then why you run off to London?

38:37.558 --> 38:38.893
(sighs)

38:40.961 --> 38:43.864
I came back the second
that I heard that you were shot,

38:43.898 --> 38:45.265
and you know that.

38:45.299 --> 38:48.168
Two days and you were gone.

38:48.202 --> 38:50.838
When you got shot,
I stayed by you.

38:50.871 --> 38:53.708
When you shot Angelo,
who was there with you?

38:53.741 --> 38:56.143
Who was there?

39:03.450 --> 39:05.385
You were.

39:07.221 --> 39:09.456
Nah, man, come here.

39:09.489 --> 39:12.159
You were.

39:21.168 --> 39:23.003
-(door closes)
-(exhales)

39:24.304 --> 39:26.240
-We good?
-LUCIOUS: Unfortunately,

39:26.273 --> 39:28.876
your manager, he's...

39:28.909 --> 39:30.778
He ran into something.

39:30.811 --> 39:32.046
Now, what do you know
about singing?

39:32.079 --> 39:34.915
I... just sing.

39:34.949 --> 39:38.719
Well, keep in mind
that singing is not about

39:38.753 --> 39:40.721
trying to hit
some particular note,

39:40.755 --> 39:44.091
it's about taking
what you feel inside

39:44.124 --> 39:46.761
and sharing that
with everybody around.

39:46.794 --> 39:49.563
Okay, okay, but I...

39:49.596 --> 39:52.399
I don't know if I can
do all that. I'll try.

39:52.432 --> 39:55.469
Well, do you like your job?

39:55.502 --> 39:57.638
No, sir, I don't.
I mean, being in there,

39:57.672 --> 40:00.240
as soon as I walk in,
I feel like I'm a prisoner, too.

40:00.274 --> 40:02.643
I see those men suffering

40:02.677 --> 40:06.146
and being treated like
less than human all the time.

40:06.180 --> 40:08.983
Yeah, well, we want
to hear that in your voice.

40:09.016 --> 40:10.517
Share that with us.

40:12.687 --> 40:14.989
You know, everybody said
I wasn't gonna be good enough...

40:15.022 --> 40:17.858
Okay, okay. You know what?
Girl, we lost Empire.

40:17.892 --> 40:19.293
We lost it. Gone.

40:19.326 --> 40:21.361
But we are still here,

40:21.395 --> 40:22.997
so don't you ever let
nobody stop you

40:23.030 --> 40:25.666
from doing what you were
born to do. Okay?

40:25.700 --> 40:27.367
Now sing the song, child.

40:27.401 --> 40:29.336
LUCIOUS:
I want to feel that.

40:31.471 --> 40:34.474
* Never seen a girl like me

40:34.508 --> 40:36.777
* They'll never put
a hold on me *

40:36.811 --> 40:38.846
* No, I...

40:38.879 --> 40:40.547
* I'll do it all alone *

40:40.580 --> 40:43.483
* I'll do it on my own *

40:43.517 --> 40:45.953
* Nothing ever comes easy

40:45.986 --> 40:48.355
* They told me
it was just a dream *

40:48.388 --> 40:50.224
* But I...

40:50.257 --> 40:54.795
* I'm-a prove 'em wrong *

40:54.829 --> 40:56.496
(heavy R&B track begins)

40:59.666 --> 41:01.802
* Scree,
I don't need your attitude *

41:01.836 --> 41:04.304
* Don't want your goofy-ass man
with the busted shoes *

41:04.338 --> 41:07.241
* I'm walking in bossed up,
got a lot to prove *

41:07.274 --> 41:09.243
* I'm breaking necks with
the way that my body move *

41:09.276 --> 41:12.579
* I know they asking who's that
chick with all the confidence *

41:12.612 --> 41:14.915
* Step into the room
like she owning this *

41:14.949 --> 41:17.384
* I'm coming for your check,
I'm-a garnish it *

41:17.417 --> 41:20.554
* I don't want a piece,
I want all of-- cold *

41:20.587 --> 41:22.823
* Never seen a chick so cold,
never seen a whip so cold *

41:22.857 --> 41:25.659
* Tell me, have you ever seen
a chick so cold? *

41:25.692 --> 41:29.263
* They be like, no,
we never seen a chick so cold *

41:29.296 --> 41:31.832
* Shining my light,
I'm the best *

41:31.866 --> 41:35.202
* Never seen nobody like me

41:35.235 --> 41:37.071
* So cold

41:37.104 --> 41:39.006
* So...

41:39.039 --> 41:41.041
* Shining my light,
I'm the best *

41:41.075 --> 41:44.411
* Never seen nobody like me.

41:44.444 --> 41:46.246
-She's kinda dope,
y'all, seriously.
-Mm-hmm.

41:46.280 --> 41:48.382
-She's really dope.
-Hey, Ma, who the hell is this?

41:48.415 --> 41:51.351
That is Treasure,
and we just signed her.

41:51.385 --> 41:53.353
What you mean, "signed her"?

41:53.387 --> 41:54.755
-Yeah, we started
our own label. Hakeem.
-COOKIE: Yes.

41:54.789 --> 41:56.223
-There you go.
-Thank you.

41:56.256 --> 41:57.958
It's going to be
our new family label.

41:57.992 --> 42:00.961
And we're gonna give
Hakeem time to heal,

42:00.995 --> 42:02.396
and Andre is joining us
when he gets home.

42:02.429 --> 42:04.899
Yeah, and we're
getting you out of

42:04.932 --> 42:06.566
that wack-ass contract
with Empire.

42:06.600 --> 42:07.734
-Mm-hmm.
-JAMAL: Wait, hold up.

42:07.768 --> 42:09.736
(chuckles)
I'm proud of y'all,

42:09.770 --> 42:12.406
I really am, but I got
my own label I'm starting.

42:12.439 --> 42:14.374
I... got my own man.

42:14.408 --> 42:17.144
I got a life
in London to get back to.

42:17.177 --> 42:18.779
Boy, that's a hobby.
You ain't got no check.

42:18.813 --> 42:22.149
You gonna stay here until
at least we launch it, okay?

42:22.182 --> 42:24.151
-Ma...
-Baby.
-LUCIOUS: No, look, Mal, this is

42:24.184 --> 42:25.285
-about the family.
-COOKIE: Yes.

42:25.319 --> 42:27.054
LUCIOUS:
It's for us and about us.

42:27.087 --> 42:28.322
That's right.

42:28.355 --> 42:31.591
And London ain't going nowhere,
and neither is that boy.

42:33.027 --> 42:35.095
Come on. To the Lyons.

42:37.832 --> 42:39.766
May we rise.

42:39.800 --> 42:41.401
Like always.

42:41.435 --> 42:42.736
Come on, clink, clink!

42:42.769 --> 42:44.504
(laughter)

42:51.846 --> 42:53.780
*

43:02.990 --> 43:05.325

I'm sorry.
