you're talking about.

08:54.055 --> 08:55.491
Her name is Vanessa.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.449
She lives in Brooklyn.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.677
- Smoke?
- No, thanks.

09:07.764 --> 09:09.940
It's, uh, a little
early for me.

09:10.027 --> 09:11.899
So how can I help,
Nathaniel?

09:11.986 --> 09:14.466
About last week, um, the money?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.947
I, uh, I might have
overreacted a little.

09:17.034 --> 09:18.427
- A little?
- 'Yeah.'

09:18.514 --> 09:20.603
And hey, if you can

09:20.690 --> 09:22.779
I would love to take you up
on the offer as a loan.

09:22.866 --> 09:24.694
I thought you were getting
the money from somewhere else.

09:24.781 --> 09:27.610
Yeah, well, that person,
um, is asking for a lot.

09:30.613 --> 09:32.572
Well..

09:32.659 --> 09:34.443
I'd love to accommodate you

09:34.530 --> 09:35.923
but when you spurned my offer

09:36.010 --> 09:37.489
I sent the money
to my financial guides.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.491
It's tied up in bonds
for six months.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.668
Oh. Uh, no. That's cool.

09:41.755 --> 09:43.626
I'll just..
I'll find another way.

09:43.713 --> 09:47.195
So, uh, have you seen Blair
and Lord Fauntleroy recently?

09:47.282 --> 09:48.718
No.

09:50.807 --> 09:52.548
- Are you doing okay?
- Mm-hmm.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.681
I'll confess, I've been feeling
a little off my game

09:54.768 --> 09:56.073
[elevator bell dings]

09:56.160 --> 09:58.380
but I'm expecting
a return to form very soon.

09:58.467 --> 10:01.035
Sir, the flight from Tokyo
has landed.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.475
So I can see.

10:10.305 --> 10:11.611
Konnichiwa.

10:14.222 --> 10:16.485
I know it's hot,
but I need everything fitted

10:16.572 --> 10:18.618
and ready for Eleanor
to inspect. Jenny?

10:18.705 --> 10:19.749
Yeah, I know.
I'll clean the atelier

10:19.836 --> 10:20.881
as soon as I'm finished
here, okay?

10:20.968 --> 10:22.622
The bathrooms, too.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.972
Someone decided to give us
a second look at breakfast.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.584
Laurel believes in her interns
paying their dues.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.325
You must really want this.

10:30.412 --> 10:32.109
Why? 'Cause for the past
three months

10:32.196 --> 10:34.895
I've put up with midnight
coffee runs, 15-hour days

10:34.982 --> 10:36.636
cleaning up after
the two in-house bulimics

10:36.723 --> 10:38.202
all so that Eleanor Waldorf

10:38.289 --> 10:40.857
will spend five minutes
looking at my designs?

10:40.944 --> 10:43.164
Yeah. Yeah,
I really, really do.

10:43.251 --> 10:44.339
Okay.

10:45.732 --> 10:48.648
Uh, I feel like
it's not right.

Um, hold on.

Eleanor's plane's on time.

10:57.221 --> 10:59.093
Oh. Alright, I'm gonna
meet her at the penthouse.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.225
I think Blair's
hosting a party there.

11:01.312 --> 11:03.532
If the AC guy comes,
call me. Yes?

11:03.619 --> 11:05.490
I think there might be
something wrong with the dress.

11:11.148 --> 11:14.151
No. This-this is
what Eleanor designed.

11:14.238 --> 11:15.849
Really? Even--

11:15.936 --> 11:17.633
Did you ever see
"Cinderella?"

11:17.720 --> 11:19.243
The cartoon?
Sure.

11:19.330 --> 11:22.116
Remember the little birds
that helped her dress?

11:22.203 --> 11:24.945
Remember how they didn't
offer their opinion?

11:25.032 --> 11:27.730
Try to imagine that
you're one of those birds.

11:27.817 --> 11:30.515

- Yeah.

11:47.228 --> 11:50.274

Oh, God.
You-you agree with her.

11:53.930 --> 11:55.105

She never will

Okay, um, well, look,
this is..

12:32.316 --> 12:33.970
this is both creepy
and none of your business.

12:34.057 --> 12:36.364
So if you could, uh, just go,
please. You can just run along.

12:36.451 --> 12:37.800
Alright, I-I lost her.

12:37.887 --> 12:40.194
They were on a yacht
with some Greek prince.

- Hello.
- Yeah, ignore them.

forgive him

12:44.198 --> 12:45.503
after sleeping with Georgina?

12:45.590 --> 12:47.462
- What?
- What? No. No, this is insane.

12:47.549 --> 12:48.811
- I didn't sleep with Georgina.
- No.

12:48.898 --> 12:49.856
Alright? Please go.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.335
But we're on your side.

12:51.422 --> 12:53.294
Not me. His mouth
kissed Georgina's.

Think about that
the next time--

O-okay. Yeah. Th-that's enough.
Now I'm telling you to go.

12:57.559 --> 12:58.473
Come on. Get out of here. Shoo.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.866

I have to do

I need people around here
that I can trust.

18:05.301 --> 18:07.782
Clean out your station.

18:07.869 --> 18:09.305
What? No.

18:10.263 --> 18:11.742
No, please. You can't--

18:11.829 --> 18:13.614
Oh, yes please, I can.

'And if you are still hoping
for a letter of recommendation'

'Nate!'

18:31.414 --> 18:33.024
- Oh, hey!
- I thought that was you.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.287
A little warm for a run,
isn't it?

18:34.374 --> 18:36.506
Yeah, you know,
I was just, um

18:36.593 --> 18:38.204
had some things
to think about. So.

18:38.291 --> 18:39.683
Hey, will I see you
at Blair's tonight?

18:39.770 --> 18:41.772
Yeah. Uh, you headed
down there now or what?

18:41.859 --> 18:43.861
No, no. I promised the Duchess
I'd pick her up.

18:43.948 --> 18:45.211
Oh, your mother's coming.

18:45.298 --> 18:48.301
Oh, yes. Oh, she and Blair
are fast friends.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.433
I always find them
whispering in a corner.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.479
It's a bit troubling,
come to think of it.

18:52.566 --> 18:54.350
Anyway, uh,
I'll see you tonight.

18:54.437 --> 18:55.960
Thanks, man.

Hey, Vanessa. It's Nate.

19:08.451 --> 19:09.974
Uh, listen

19:10.061 --> 19:12.238
I'm so sorry,
ab-about tonight.

19:12.325 --> 19:13.456
It's just, um..

19:19.767 --> 19:21.290
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:23.074 --> 19:23.988
I thought you and Dan were
leaving for the party.

19:24.075 --> 19:25.729
Yeah. We're supposed to.

19:25.816 --> 19:27.296
He's not still reading
one of those Dan and Serena

19:27.383 --> 19:28.341
should they or shouldn't they
threads, is he?

19:28.428 --> 19:29.342
Last I checked, yeah.

19:30.386 --> 19:31.387
Something's wrong?

19:31.474 --> 19:33.041
I just got a message from Nate.

19:33.128 --> 19:35.565

burden me, the same old story.

19:35.652 --> 19:38.829
I just want to shake him, like,
I can handle it, you know?

19:38.916 --> 19:40.657
Hey. Sorry.
I'm, uh, I'm ready.

19:40.744 --> 19:43.007
So how was public opinion
on the Dan and Serena front?

19:43.094 --> 19:45.184
Oh, well, it turns out
most people think I'm an ass.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.577
But a passionate minority hold
I'm just an idiot.

19:47.664 --> 19:49.449
So.. Are you ready?

19:49.536 --> 19:50.885
Uh, Nate's running late.
I'll just..

19:50.972 --> 19:52.452
I'll meet you there.

19:52.539 --> 19:55.063
- Okay. You sure?
- Yeah.

19:55.150 --> 19:57.892
Uh, you still positive
you don't want me tagging along?

19:57.979 --> 20:00.329
Yeah. No offense, dad,
but I think you, me and Serena..

20:00.416 --> 20:01.983
things are awkward enough.

20:02.070 --> 20:03.550
Well, it's not like
I'd have to be a third wheel.

20:03.637 --> 20:05.682
I can bring a date.

20:05.769 --> 20:07.075
[laughing]

20:07.162 --> 20:08.511
- What?
- No, it's..

you having a date is funny

of the realm of possibility

20:12.211 --> 20:13.473

20:13.560 --> 20:15.997
One day I might surprise you.

20:16.084 --> 20:18.304
- Go.
- See you there.

20:20.523 --> 20:22.569
You know, if you really like
this guy

20:22.656 --> 20:23.657
you should call him.

20:23.744 --> 20:24.745
Tell him how you feel.

20:24.832 --> 20:26.312
The mature response.
Tempting.

20:27.965 --> 20:30.620
Or if you're looking
for something immature

20:30.707 --> 20:33.101
you could tell him you left
the phone in the gallery

20:33.188 --> 20:34.755
and never got the message.

to leave you on your own.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.945
- Oh, thank you, darling.
- My pleasure.

20:51.032 --> 20:53.339
Well, the ancestral home
is next to Balmoral.

20:53.426 --> 20:55.384
Marcus tells
the funniest story

20:55.471 --> 20:57.473
about Harry running naked
across their lawn.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.780
Prince Harry?
I love him.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.042
But you've been
planning on Yale

21:01.129 --> 21:02.826
ever since you
were a little girl.

21:02.913 --> 21:05.046
I know, but Marcus keeps
begging me to consider Oxford.

21:05.133 --> 21:07.004
What a pity.

21:07.091 --> 21:09.180
So much wasted potential.

21:10.312 --> 21:11.618
What are you talking about?

21:11.705 --> 21:14.490
The thing that always
fascinated me about you.

21:14.577 --> 21:17.363
The cool exterior,
the fire below.

21:17.450 --> 21:20.453
You are living proof

Not that it's any
of your business

21:30.550 --> 21:32.552

have an amazing sex life.

- Hmm.

40:49.577 --> 40:50.883
I do.

40:52.841 --> 40:55.409
That's..
That's why I did it.

40:57.367 --> 40:59.239
I don't understand.

41:03.112 --> 41:07.247
She told me
that if Nate left her

41:07.334 --> 41:10.076
she would...go to the FBI

41:10.163 --> 41:13.209
and tell them where
Nate's dad is hiding out.

41:16.822 --> 41:17.997
So..

41:19.172 --> 41:21.522
I really didn't have
a choice.

[Gossip Girl]
Love may fade with the season

41:44.980 --> 41:47.896
but some friendships
are year-round

41:47.983 --> 41:49.942
like you and me.

41:50.029 --> 41:52.292
You know you love me.

41:52.379 --> 41:55.295
XOXO, Gossip Girl.
