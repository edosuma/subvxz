WEBVTT

00:06.354 --> 00:08.878
- For most people, a burrito
is a delicious meal

00:08.921 --> 00:12.012
wrapped in a tortilla
but for one NYPD officer,

00:12.055 --> 00:15.058
it turned out to be a mouse
wrapped in a nightmare.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.625
- So I order a grande steak.

00:16.668 --> 00:18.670
I get back to my car,
take a big bite, and crunch.

00:18.714 --> 00:20.498
That's when I see it--
a dead mouse.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.587
- A dead mouse
that Frank O'Sullivan,

00:22.631 --> 00:24.111
the President
of the Patrolman's Union,

00:24.154 --> 00:26.330
says was put there on purpose.

00:26.374 --> 00:28.593
- This was an act
of political violence

00:28.637 --> 00:33.033
organized by a group of radical
anti-cop Antifa anarchists

00:33.076 --> 00:34.817
working out
of The Burrito Haven.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.514
- This is bogus.

00:36.558 --> 00:39.256
The officer called in a to-go
order under the name Tom.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.389
The restaurant had no idea
he was a cop

00:41.432 --> 00:43.086
when they made the food
or packed the bag.

00:43.130 --> 00:46.263
So, clearly, he wasn't targeted
for "being a police officer."

00:46.307 --> 00:48.048
- I've always wanted
to try mouse meat.

00:48.091 --> 00:50.180
I hear it's really tasty.
- From who?

00:50.224 --> 00:52.139
- The union made it up
as a power move.

00:52.182 --> 00:53.488
O'Sullivan wants me to issue

00:53.531 --> 00:55.533
a statement of public support
for the officer,

00:55.577 --> 00:57.274
to give them
all extra hazard pay

00:57.318 --> 01:00.190
and to wear this
Never Forget Burrito ribbon.

01:00.234 --> 01:01.887
- Weird. It's the exact
same color

01:01.931 --> 01:03.585
as my Color Blind Awareness
ribbon.

01:03.628 --> 01:06.109
- No, it isn't. I won't give in
to any of their demands.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.545
The union is powerful,
but I'm sure

01:07.589 --> 01:09.765
that most of our uniformed
officers understand

01:09.808 --> 01:11.549
this incident is nonsense.

01:11.593 --> 01:15.075
It is, as Peralta would say,
"No big 'whoop.'"

01:15.118 --> 01:16.554
- I appreciate
the shout-out, sir,

01:16.598 --> 01:18.208
but I actually don't pronounce
the H in whoop.

01:18.252 --> 01:21.168
- Sir, all the uniformed
officers just left.

01:21.211 --> 01:22.908
They're staging a walkout.

01:22.952 --> 01:25.389
- Well, it seems I was wrong.

01:25.433 --> 01:28.479
The "whoop" is big after all.

01:28.523 --> 01:29.611
- It is.

01:29.654 --> 01:32.266
Again, though,
there's no H in whoop.

01:32.309 --> 01:33.615
It's silent.

01:33.658 --> 01:35.007
- "Whoop."

01:35.051 --> 01:36.400
- Whoop.
- "Whoop."

01:36.444 --> 01:37.967
- Am I crazy?
How do you say it?

01:38.010 --> 01:39.925
- I say "whoop."
- Okay.

01:42.972 --> 01:49.892
<i>♪</i>

01:59.945 --> 02:02.774
- How is it possible that every
single uniformed officer

02:02.818 --> 02:03.993
got sick at once?

02:04.036 --> 02:05.299
- They're not actually sick.

02:05.342 --> 02:06.561
They aren't actually
allowed to strike,

02:06.604 --> 02:07.910
so they made up
a medical excuse.

02:07.953 --> 02:09.390
It's called a Blue Flu.

02:09.433 --> 02:11.566
- Without uniforms on the
street, crime's gonna go up.

02:11.609 --> 02:12.958
Do we have to negotiate
with the union?

02:13.002 --> 02:15.178
- No. I haven't gone through
decades of hell

02:15.222 --> 02:17.180
to become a captain in the NYPD

02:17.224 --> 02:19.269
just to cave to a clown
like O'Sullivan.

02:19.313 --> 02:21.271
We can't let him win,
and we won't.

02:21.315 --> 02:22.446
- But how?
What are we gonna do?

02:22.490 --> 02:24.318
- I'm initiating
Operation Trident.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.189
- Cool.
Just like the sugarless gum--

02:26.233 --> 02:27.625
because we're gonna
chew them up.

02:27.669 --> 02:30.541
- No, like the famed weapon
of the sea,

02:30.585 --> 02:33.240
forged by the Cyclops
for Poseidon himself.

02:33.283 --> 02:35.981
The trident has three prongs,
like my approach.

02:36.025 --> 02:37.244
- Ah, not to interrupt,

02:37.287 --> 02:38.941
but Aquaman's trident
has five prongs.

02:38.984 --> 02:42.249
- That's absurd.
The prefix tri means three.

02:42.292 --> 02:45.165
What this aquatic-man carries
is better termed a "pentadent."

02:45.208 --> 02:46.557
- No, it's a trident.

02:46.601 --> 02:48.211
They call it that in the
original theatrical release

02:48.255 --> 02:49.821
and the Snyder cut.

02:49.865 --> 02:51.301
So you're 100% wrong,
and everyone's laughing at you.

02:51.345 --> 02:52.476
- Well, regardless,

02:52.520 --> 02:54.174
Operation Trident
has three prongs.

02:54.217 --> 02:55.784
Prong one, Boyle and Peralta.

02:55.827 --> 02:57.438
- Oh, nice,
the most important prong.

02:57.481 --> 02:58.482
- Mm-hmm.
- Wrong.

02:58.526 --> 02:59.744
Prong two, the center prong,

02:59.788 --> 03:01.572
is the most important prong
on a trident.

03:01.616 --> 03:03.008
It's the longest
and straightest

03:03.052 --> 03:04.445
and breaks the least often.

03:04.488 --> 03:05.663
- Are you just mad because

03:05.707 --> 03:07.056
I questioned you
about the Aquaman thing?

03:07.099 --> 03:09.493
- Yes. The officers
all had doctor's notes.

03:09.537 --> 03:10.625
Prove those notes
are fraudulent,

03:10.668 --> 03:12.322
and they'll be forced
back to work.

03:12.366 --> 03:13.845
- We're on it.
- Prong two--

03:13.889 --> 03:16.935
Jeffords and Santiago,
your job is to keep crime down.

03:16.979 --> 03:19.503
Figure out how we police
this precinct with no police.

03:19.547 --> 03:21.766
- Prong two, baby--
the best prong.

03:21.810 --> 03:23.551
- I mean,
we're all in it together.

03:23.594 --> 03:25.248
It's not like this is
a competition between prongs.

03:25.292 --> 03:26.945
- Says the prong
who breaks the most.

03:26.989 --> 03:30.079
- Prong three is proving they
faked the mouse in the burrito.

03:30.122 --> 03:32.516
If we can demonstrate
this was a media stunt,

03:32.560 --> 03:34.605
the uniforms will have to
come back to work.

03:34.649 --> 03:36.694
But this investigation
must be done unofficially

03:36.738 --> 03:39.219
with an investigator from
outside the NYPD,

03:39.262 --> 03:41.569
aka Rosa Diaz.

03:41.612 --> 03:43.614
- It's a good idea,
but she's not gonna like being

03:43.658 --> 03:45.703
one of those dinky side prongs.
- That's a good point.

03:45.747 --> 03:47.792
I'll make hers the sharpest.
Dismissed.

03:47.836 --> 03:50.099
- What? No!
I want to be a sharp prong!

03:50.142 --> 03:51.709
That's not fair!

03:51.753 --> 03:53.842
- All these notes are
from the same doctor.

03:53.885 --> 03:56.279
- Everyone got a blood test,
and they all had mono.

03:56.323 --> 03:57.541
That seems really improbable.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.239
- Yeah, nobody gets mono
at this age.

03:59.282 --> 04:00.501
You get it as an
eight-year-old,

04:00.544 --> 04:01.806
and then you're immune.

04:01.850 --> 04:03.243
- Wait, you get it
as an eight-year-old?

04:03.286 --> 04:04.287
Mono? The kissing disease?

04:04.331 --> 04:05.549
- No, it's
the cousin's disease.

04:05.593 --> 04:06.942
You get it
by kissing your cousins.

04:06.985 --> 04:09.249
Oh, I guess we're both right.
- No.

04:09.292 --> 04:11.555
Wait a minute--
if you're immune,

04:11.599 --> 04:13.601
then you can tell the doctor
you're from the Nine-Nine,

04:13.644 --> 04:15.342
and when he gives you
a mono diagnosis...

04:15.385 --> 04:17.169
- We'll have proof
that his notes are fake.

04:17.213 --> 04:18.562
-
- Wow.

04:18.606 --> 04:20.260
I can't believe all those
lazy childhood afternoons

04:20.303 --> 04:21.913
playing hide the yam
finally paid off.

04:25.047 --> 04:27.615
You see, you take a yam--
- I don't want to know!

04:27.658 --> 04:29.138
- Prong two update--
I brought in

04:29.181 --> 04:31.488
our night-shift detectives
to handle the dispatch calls

04:31.532 --> 04:34.709
and respond to major crimes--

04:34.752 --> 04:37.059
- Sorry. That's Terry's tummy.

04:37.102 --> 04:38.582
I'm feeling a little nauseous.

04:38.626 --> 04:40.149
Must've been something
I had for breakfast.

04:40.192 --> 04:41.933
- Well, do you have to go home,
or can you tough it out?

04:41.977 --> 04:43.935
- So, if Terry goes home,
he's not tough?

04:43.979 --> 04:45.589
- Here we go.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.112
- Lieutenant, we don't have
the time today to make this

04:47.156 --> 04:48.462
about some larger insecurity

04:48.505 --> 04:50.028
you have regarding
your toughness.

04:50.072 --> 04:52.596
- First of all, I'm not
insecure about my toughness.

04:52.640 --> 04:56.208
Secondly, being sick has
nothing to do with being tough.

04:56.252 --> 04:59.516
Thirdly, if I wasn't tough,
would I be daring Amy

04:59.560 --> 05:01.692
to punch me in the stomach?
- Wha--

05:01.736 --> 05:03.433
- Come on, Amy!
Give me your best shot!

05:03.477 --> 05:05.435
- Fine.
Just so that we can move on.

05:09.483 --> 05:11.659
- See? I'm fine.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.400
Now, if you'll excuse me,

05:13.443 --> 05:15.793
I'm gonna go for a walk
in the fresh air

05:15.837 --> 05:18.796
with my best friend,
the trash can.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.407
I'll be back 'cause I'm tough!

05:20.450 --> 05:22.060
- Let's talk quickly
before he returns

05:22.104 --> 05:23.845
and makes this all
about himself again.

05:23.888 --> 05:25.760
- Okay. We can't use uniforms
from other precincts

05:25.803 --> 05:27.152
because they'll call
out sick, too.

05:27.196 --> 05:29.459
So I asked the other captains
in the district

05:29.503 --> 05:30.808
to lend us some detectives.

05:30.852 --> 05:32.027
- Smart.
They have a different union.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.768
- And they each sent us
two people.

05:33.811 --> 05:35.291
They said
they were happy to do it.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.988
- Huh. That's odd.

05:37.032 --> 05:40.862
I wouldn't be happy to give up
two of my detectives, unless--

05:40.905 --> 05:42.080
- Dear God.

05:42.124 --> 05:44.256
They sent us
their Hitchcock-and-Scullys.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.258
- It's a nightmare.

05:46.302 --> 05:47.477
- So you've been
feeling fatigued?

05:47.521 --> 05:49.261
- Yeah. I think I have mono.

05:49.305 --> 05:51.046
I'm from the 99th precinct.

05:51.089 --> 05:52.352
<i>- Ah, yeah, I've heard</i>

05:52.395 --> 05:53.831
<i>they've had some kind
of outbreak there.</i>

05:53.875 --> 05:56.094
- Mm-hmm. So now that you know
where I'm from,

05:56.138 --> 05:57.661
can you just write me a note?

05:57.705 --> 05:59.489
- Uh, no, actually, I need to
order bloodwork

05:59.533 --> 06:01.404
and do a full exam.
- Ah.

06:01.448 --> 06:02.840
- Lift up.
- Oh, yeah.

06:02.884 --> 06:04.712
- Oh. Now, that is interesting.

06:04.755 --> 06:06.844
- Oh, did you find
a sign of mono?

06:06.888 --> 06:08.672
- No, it's your testicle.
- My what?

06:08.716 --> 06:10.326
- The left one is enormous.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.676
<i>- Oh, well, can't one testicle
be larger than the other?</i>

06:12.720 --> 06:15.026
- Well, yes,
but it shouldn't be that large.

06:15.070 --> 06:18.029
And also of concern
is the shape and the color...

06:18.073 --> 06:19.466
- Yeah, that doesn't
sound good.

06:19.509 --> 06:20.641
<i>- And the texture.</i>

06:20.684 --> 06:22.904
Wow! Oh, that is ice cold!

06:25.515 --> 06:27.648
- So...
- So...

06:27.691 --> 06:29.127
- You heard all that?
- I did.

06:29.171 --> 06:30.955
- Even the part where
he's talking about my huge--

06:30.999 --> 06:34.045
- Yep. Yep, yep, yep.
All the parts.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.438
You okay?
- Yeah.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.701
I mean, could be cancer.
Might have spread.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.268
But I'm fine.
I can handle this.

06:39.311 --> 06:40.922
- You sure about that?

06:40.965 --> 06:44.186
'Cause you're still wearing
your hospital gown there, bud.

06:44.229 --> 06:46.971
- So I am.

06:47.015 --> 06:48.712
- Ah, there she is.

06:48.756 --> 06:51.236
My sweet secret prong three.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.673
- What the hell?
- Oh, right.

06:52.716 --> 06:54.805
You weren't there when
I explained Operation Trident.

06:54.849 --> 06:55.980
So, uh, what did you find?

06:56.024 --> 06:57.547
- Nothing yet,
and if you want me

06:57.591 --> 06:59.027
to keep digging,
we need to talk about my fee.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.942
I need cash. Most of
my other work is pro bono.

07:00.985 --> 07:02.900
- This is unofficial.
I can't pay.

07:02.944 --> 07:04.902
- Right, but there is something
you can give me,

07:04.946 --> 07:06.904
something just
as valuable as money.

07:06.948 --> 07:09.646
I want to see your tattoo.
- That's just as valuable?

07:09.690 --> 07:11.953
- It is to Jake. He's offered
a significant reward.

07:11.996 --> 07:14.434
- Wow. It is so ridiculous
how much weight

07:14.477 --> 07:16.087
you've all given
to my silly tattoo,

07:16.131 --> 07:18.481
like it's some huge secret
that I'll take to my grave.

07:18.525 --> 07:19.656
- I notice
you haven't said yes yet.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.353
- 'Cause no one can ever know.

07:21.397 --> 07:22.877
Okay, fine.

07:22.920 --> 07:26.097
If you can prove how that mouse
got into that burrito,

07:26.141 --> 07:27.751
I'll tell you
what my tattoo is.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.840
- I need a photo of it.
- You're a monster.

07:29.884 --> 07:31.451
Wait. I may not have
to deal with you.

07:31.494 --> 07:32.756
Santiago,
how's prong two looking?

07:32.800 --> 07:34.410
- Well, the good news

07:34.454 --> 07:36.456
is the Scully-and-Hitchcocks
actually work well together.

07:36.499 --> 07:37.935
- That is good news.

07:37.979 --> 07:40.285
- The bad news is it's at
making a back-scratch circle.

07:40.329 --> 07:42.287
- I always wondered
what it would be like to have

07:42.331 --> 07:43.724
a tight-knit work family.

07:43.767 --> 07:46.640
Nine-Nine!
Nine-Nine!

07:46.683 --> 07:49.512
- Ah, there they are--
prong one,

07:49.556 --> 07:51.253
my most important prong.

07:51.296 --> 07:53.473
- Oh, thank you. Nice of you
to finally recognize

07:53.516 --> 07:54.822
what our prong brings to this.

07:54.865 --> 07:58.565
- Life is a cruel prank played
on the living.

07:58.608 --> 08:00.697
Death mocks us all.

08:00.741 --> 08:04.484
Time to go tell me son
he'll be an orphan... again.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.834
- So, yeah. Prong one
pretty much broke immediately.

08:06.877 --> 08:08.662
I'm gonna call HR.
Get ahead of that butt.

08:11.012 --> 08:13.231
- Here's where we stand.
The Blue Flu continues.

08:13.275 --> 08:14.711
O'Sullivan and the union
won't budge

08:14.755 --> 08:16.234
on their mouse-burrito demands.

08:16.278 --> 08:18.541
Also, arrests are down.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.674
Santiago, Jeffords, what
on earth happened yesterday?

08:20.717 --> 08:23.111
- The new detectives
won't do anything I ask.

08:23.154 --> 08:25.635
And I've had to work solo.
- Sorry.

08:25.679 --> 08:28.769
I was feeling a little sick,
but I am much better now.

08:28.812 --> 08:30.248
- You look like garbage.

08:30.292 --> 08:32.120
Now, I know you're trying
to tough this out,

08:32.163 --> 08:34.165
but I've always believed
that true toughness

08:34.209 --> 08:36.385
means acknowledging
your own limitations.

08:36.428 --> 08:38.605
It's okay, Terry. Go home.

08:38.648 --> 08:40.868
- Thank you, sir.
I'll be back in a jiffy.

08:42.434 --> 08:44.175
- I can't believe
he bought that drivel.

08:44.219 --> 08:46.569
True toughness means
working through pain.

08:46.613 --> 08:47.701
Everyone knows that.

08:47.744 --> 08:49.572
Peralta, where are we
with the doctor?

08:49.616 --> 08:51.574
- We're gonna tail him and see
if he contacts O'Sullivan.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.707
- Smart. And, uh, what is going
on with Detective Boyle?

08:53.750 --> 08:55.056
Is he okay?

08:55.099 --> 08:56.884
- Oh, you mean why is he
face-deep in cheese?

08:56.927 --> 08:59.408
Yeah, it's made from the milk
of a Balkan donkey

08:59.451 --> 09:01.105
and apparently
it's quite expensive.

09:01.149 --> 09:03.064
- Spent 12 thou on ass cheese.

09:03.107 --> 09:04.500
- Also, he's pretending like

09:04.544 --> 09:06.154
he doesn't know
what ass cheese sounds like.

09:06.197 --> 09:07.590
- Are you sure
he should be working?

09:07.634 --> 09:09.287
- His doctor said
there's nothing to worry about

09:09.331 --> 09:10.680
until we get
the actual test results back.

09:10.724 --> 09:12.464
And Charles said that work

09:12.508 --> 09:13.988
is the only thing keeping him
from thinking about death.

09:14.031 --> 09:16.425
- Coat's to keep me warm...

09:16.468 --> 09:18.035
in my grave.

09:20.037 --> 09:22.170
- I mean, he's not doing great.

09:22.213 --> 09:24.738
- Oh, you guys still
have lunch together?

09:24.781 --> 09:26.043
<i>- Twice a day, every day.</i>

09:26.087 --> 09:27.479
- Look, I need help
figuring out

09:27.523 --> 09:29.264
how to inspire these new guys.

09:29.307 --> 09:30.831
What motivates you?

09:30.874 --> 09:32.397
- Well, I'd do anything
to retire

09:32.441 --> 09:34.704
and spend the rest of my days
with Hitchcock in Brazil.

09:34.748 --> 09:36.140
- Huh. That's actually
pretty helpful.

09:36.184 --> 09:37.620
<i>- That's the dream--</i>

09:37.664 --> 09:39.361
<i>Scully and me on the sex barge
I'm building.</i>

09:39.404 --> 09:40.971
- Okay.
Scully was already helpful.

09:41.015 --> 09:42.059
You don't have to keep talking.

09:42.103 --> 09:43.626
These are pedometers,

09:43.670 --> 09:45.846
which will prove that you're
actually walking your beat.

09:47.238 --> 09:49.240
But whoever gets
the most steps in

09:49.284 --> 09:52.330
will receive
seven days of overtime.

09:52.374 --> 09:56.639
Therefore, you'll be one week
closer to retirement.

09:56.683 --> 09:59.033
- And one week closer
to a couple's massage

09:59.076 --> 10:01.252
with your best friend
on his sex barge.

10:04.212 --> 10:06.127
- Sir, guess what.

10:06.170 --> 10:08.477
- Lieutenant,
I thought you went home.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.522
- I did, but some uniforms
heard that I called out sick,

10:10.566 --> 10:12.524
and they assumed
I was joining the Blue Flu.

10:12.568 --> 10:15.049
They invited me to a meeting
tomorrow to talk strategy.

10:15.092 --> 10:16.616
- You could go record them

10:16.659 --> 10:18.530
admitting that
they don't actually have mono.

10:18.574 --> 10:20.837
That is, if you're up to it.
- Hell, yeah.

10:20.881 --> 10:22.186
Terry's gonna tough it out.

10:22.230 --> 10:24.754
Terry's also gonna drink
some raspberry leaf tea

10:24.798 --> 10:27.235
that Sharon uses to help her
with menstrual cramps.

10:27.278 --> 10:28.540
- Oh, looks like we're
adding a prong.

10:28.584 --> 10:32.153
Operation Trident
is now Operation Fork.

10:32.196 --> 10:34.155
- Isn't there a cooler word
than "fork"?

10:34.198 --> 10:35.635
I mean,
something more like "trident."

10:35.678 --> 10:37.680
- Oh, no, did everyone assume
I was trying to be cool?

10:37.724 --> 10:39.464
Is that why things
are going so poorly?

10:39.508 --> 10:41.510
Damn it,
I've got to call Peralta.

10:41.553 --> 10:44.556
- No, Operation Fork
is definitely not cool.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.428
Uh, yeah, things are
going good here.

10:46.471 --> 10:47.690
We're just staking out
the doctor

10:47.734 --> 10:49.561
and trying to keep
a low profile.

10:49.605 --> 10:53.391
<i>♪ And I'll be
your brightest-- ♪</i>

10:53.435 --> 10:55.393
Sorry about that. Just had
a bit of a noisy neighbor.

10:55.437 --> 10:56.917
<i>- ♪ I'll be--</i>

10:56.960 --> 10:59.049
- You know what, sir?
We have another noisy neighbor.

10:59.093 --> 11:00.703
I'm just gonna call you back.
Bye.

11:00.747 --> 11:03.575
All right, Charles, I get it.
You're scared.

11:03.619 --> 11:06.622
But sometimes it helps
to say our fears out loud.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.058
You know, if you put words
to them,

11:08.102 --> 11:09.277
it can take away
some of their powers.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.887
So come on.

11:10.931 --> 11:13.237
Stop bottling up those fears
and get them out in the open.

11:15.196 --> 11:17.807
- Okay, well...

11:17.851 --> 11:20.592
I'm scared
that whatever's in my testicle

11:20.636 --> 11:22.725
has spread
and that I'm gonna die.

11:22.769 --> 11:26.294
And then I'll never get
to see Nikolaj grow up.

11:26.337 --> 11:29.601
And I won't know
what kind of man he becomes.

11:29.645 --> 11:32.561
Also, my time with you
will be cut short.

11:32.604 --> 11:35.607
No more stakeouts
or drinks after a long shift

11:35.651 --> 11:39.176
or midnight calls when you've
had a breakthrough in a case.

11:39.220 --> 11:41.396
I've always had this image
of us in our 90s

11:41.439 --> 11:44.616
hunting down criminals
at the retirement home.

11:44.660 --> 11:48.316
But I guess that was just
a dumb fantasy...

11:48.359 --> 11:51.101
because soon
I won't be here anymore...

11:51.145 --> 11:52.624
because I'll be dead and gone

11:52.668 --> 11:54.409
and you won't ever
see me again.

11:56.672 --> 11:59.196
Jake, are you crying?
- No.

11:59.240 --> 12:01.329
Yes.

12:04.245 --> 12:05.942
- Diaz,
why the hush-hush meeting?

12:05.986 --> 12:07.378
- Because in one minute,

12:07.422 --> 12:08.858
you're gonna be showing me
your tramp stamp.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.468
- I don't have a tramp stamp.
- Prove it.

12:10.512 --> 12:12.906
Show me your lower back.

12:12.949 --> 12:15.299
- Hmm. Seems I didn't know
what a tramp stamp was.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.084
But I'm not gonna
show you anything

12:17.127 --> 12:18.302
until you've solved the case.

12:18.346 --> 12:19.782
- Surveillance footage
of McCaffery

12:19.826 --> 12:21.436
entering a pet store
and buying a mouse

12:21.479 --> 12:23.046
an hour before he found it
in his burrito.

12:23.090 --> 12:24.961
- He set the whole thing up.

12:25.005 --> 12:27.224
Diaz, you did it.

12:27.268 --> 12:29.226
- And now...

12:29.270 --> 12:30.793
my payment.

12:30.837 --> 12:33.317
- Okay, O'Sullivan,
there's McCaffery

12:33.361 --> 12:34.841
coming out
of Perdue Pet Supplies

12:34.884 --> 12:37.147
with the mouse
that he put in the burrito.

12:37.191 --> 12:38.801
So there's no need
for tactical gear

12:38.845 --> 12:41.804
or a Never Forget Burrito
ribbon or any of that.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.588
You need to call off
the Blue Flu.

12:43.632 --> 12:45.329
- Are you crazy?
My guys are under attack.

12:45.373 --> 12:46.983
- No, I just proved
that it wasn't an attack.

12:47.027 --> 12:48.158
He faked it.

12:48.202 --> 12:49.638
- Not that attack,
this attack--

12:49.681 --> 12:51.379
the one where you call
a policeman a liar.

12:51.422 --> 12:52.684
- He is a liar.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.338
- Oh, dear, my God.
You just did it again.

12:54.382 --> 12:55.862
Do you understand
the worst thing you could do

12:55.905 --> 12:59.343
to another person
is to call that person a liar?

12:59.387 --> 13:01.519
You hate cops. That's a fact.

13:01.563 --> 13:02.956
- I-I-I just thought

13:02.999 --> 13:05.567
the Blue Flu
was about a mouse in a burrito.

13:05.610 --> 13:08.570
- Well, it was, but now it's
about you saying it wasn't.

13:08.613 --> 13:10.137
- That doesn't make any sense.
- So you're calling me stupid?

13:10.180 --> 13:11.878
- That's not what I said!
- You're calling me a liar?

13:11.921 --> 13:13.444
- I just don't know how to talk
to someone like you.

13:13.488 --> 13:15.011
- Someone like me?

13:15.055 --> 13:17.622
Wow.
That's racist.

13:17.666 --> 13:21.278
- Oh, this is a very
frustrating conversation.

13:23.411 --> 13:25.152
- The union can't
be reasoned with.

13:25.195 --> 13:26.849
I need an update.
Prong one?

13:26.893 --> 13:28.198
- More broken than ever.

13:28.242 --> 13:30.026
- Ah, well, I never had
any faith in you anyway.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.854
Santiago,
how's prong two doing?

13:31.898 --> 13:32.899
- We're killing it.

13:32.942 --> 13:34.074
According to the pedometers

13:34.117 --> 13:35.423
I put
on the Hitchcock-and-Scullys,

13:35.466 --> 13:36.685
they're out walking their beat.

13:36.728 --> 13:37.817
And it's all thanks
to these guys.

13:37.860 --> 13:38.948
- Hey. <i>
- Screw you, Amy.</i>

13:38.992 --> 13:40.863
- No, I was complimenting you.

13:40.907 --> 13:43.083
<i>- Well, screw you anyway.
- Yeah.</i>

13:43.126 --> 13:45.128
- As for prong four, Jeffords
is recording

13:45.172 --> 13:47.478
the officers' secret meeting
as we speak.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.959
And I expect he'll be bursting
into my office any minute

13:50.003 --> 13:52.309
with the proof
we need to end the Blue Flu.

13:52.353 --> 13:56.096
- I got the proof we need
to end the Blue Flu.

13:56.139 --> 13:57.749
- Wait, really?
- Why so surprised?

13:57.793 --> 13:59.273
That was the plan.

13:59.316 --> 14:01.101
- Yes, but earlier,
I was talking to the squad,

14:01.144 --> 14:02.972
and I put a lot of pressure
on this moment,

14:03.016 --> 14:04.365
which I then regretted.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.541
I feared I might be hoist
on my own petard.

14:06.584 --> 14:08.151
- No petard hoisting here.

14:08.195 --> 14:09.849
They talked about everything
in front of me--

14:09.892 --> 14:11.241
how they planned
the whole thing,

14:11.285 --> 14:12.939
how long they were gonna
pretend to be sick.

14:12.982 --> 14:14.941
- And you recorded it all,
despite your own illness.

14:14.984 --> 14:16.856
I must say, I'm impressed.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.379
- Because of how tough
I am, right?

14:18.422 --> 14:20.337
- The toughest.

14:20.381 --> 14:22.687
<i>- Okay, first things first.
We got to get--</i>

14:24.559 --> 14:25.865
- What--what is that?

14:25.908 --> 14:27.301
- I had the mic close
to my chest.

14:27.344 --> 14:29.999
So I guess it must have picked
up my stomach noises,

14:30.043 --> 14:31.871
but I'm sure
it stops eventually.

14:33.263 --> 14:36.919
More stomach.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.355
It's all stomach.

14:38.399 --> 14:39.748
- And there it is...

14:39.791 --> 14:41.271
the petard.

14:41.315 --> 14:44.100
- I need your help.
Our arrests are still way down.

14:44.144 --> 14:45.580
But according to
the pedometers,

14:45.623 --> 14:46.929
our Hitchcock-and-Scullys

14:46.973 --> 14:48.713
are out there logging miles
on the beat.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.019
How are they not seeing crimes?

14:50.063 --> 14:51.542
<i>- How do you know
they're walking?</i>

14:51.586 --> 14:52.935
- I just told you--

14:52.979 --> 14:54.458
their pedometer numbers
are through the roof.

14:54.502 --> 14:56.156
- Oh, poor, simple Amy.

14:56.199 --> 14:58.201
It's like you've ever had
to mess with a medical device

14:58.245 --> 15:00.856
in order to trick
your life insurance agent.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.902
Watch and learn.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.207
- They're just using

15:04.251 --> 15:05.948
the massage chairs
to jiggle their pedometers.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.732
<i>- Life always finds a way.</i>

15:07.776 --> 15:10.344
- To do what?
- To do nothing.

15:11.214 --> 15:13.695
- Dr. Mintleman's just
working his normal job

15:13.738 --> 15:15.305
and not being a criminal.

15:15.349 --> 15:17.568
I can't believe this is
how I'm spending my final days.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.222
- Maybe it doesn't have to be.
Screw this case.

15:19.266 --> 15:20.920
What's something
you've always wanted to do?

15:20.963 --> 15:22.225
Do you have a bucket list?

15:22.269 --> 15:23.792
- Well, yeah, but, I mean,
it's only one item.

15:23.835 --> 15:25.054
- Great.
Whatever it is, we're doing it.

15:25.098 --> 15:26.969
- Live to be 110.
- Come on!

15:27.013 --> 15:28.318
- I thought I found a loophole!

15:28.362 --> 15:29.972
-
Okay, how about this?

15:30.016 --> 15:31.800
We go on
a cross-country road trip--

15:31.843 --> 15:33.933
me on a motorcycle,
you in my sidecar?

15:33.976 --> 15:35.543
Or we enter
a cooking competition,

15:35.586 --> 15:38.241
and you "Ratatouille" me from
inside of a giant chef's hat?

15:38.285 --> 15:40.461
I track down Diane Wiest,

15:40.504 --> 15:42.202
and you finally try
and use your hall pass?

15:42.245 --> 15:44.813
You're smiling,
so I guess that one's it.

15:44.856 --> 15:47.250
Oof, going with Wiest, huh?
I got to be honest, Boyle--

15:47.294 --> 15:48.730
I'm not so sure
you can pull that off.

15:48.773 --> 15:49.949
I mean, her career is red hot.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.341
She just did a movie
with Streep.

15:51.385 --> 15:52.995
- No, Jake.
That's not why I'm smiling.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.432
I'm smiling
because you know me so well.

15:55.476 --> 15:57.826
- Yeah, we're best friends.
Of course I know you.

15:57.869 --> 16:00.176
Well, as perfect
as all your ideas were,

16:00.220 --> 16:02.439
nothing tops sitting here
with my best friend.

16:02.483 --> 16:04.746
I mean, why would I want to go
to town on Diane Wiest

16:04.789 --> 16:07.792
when I can go to town with you?

16:07.836 --> 16:09.098
- What?

16:09.142 --> 16:10.795
- Hang out.
Go to town with each other.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.101
It's a common
friendship phrase.

16:12.145 --> 16:13.450
- Haven't heard it.

16:13.494 --> 16:14.669
- Oh.

16:14.712 --> 16:16.932
Oh, God.
It's my biopsy results.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.107
- What does it say?
- I don't know.

16:18.151 --> 16:19.848
I'm too nervous.
I can't read it.

16:21.154 --> 16:23.025
- It's not cancer.
- Not cancer.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.027
- It's an infection,
and it's highly treatable.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.811
- I'm not gonna die?
- You're not gonna die!

16:26.855 --> 16:28.422
- Oh, we got to celebrate.

16:28.465 --> 16:30.424
Does it say if it's safe to
ride a two-person banana boat?

16:30.467 --> 16:32.643
- I don't know. Let me check.
It doesn't say.

16:32.687 --> 16:33.775
- Oh, well...

16:33.818 --> 16:35.472
- And also,
I think just figured out

16:35.516 --> 16:38.258
how all those officers
got their fake diagnoses.

16:38.301 --> 16:39.694
Tell us what's written there.

16:39.737 --> 16:40.912
- Patient's left teste

16:40.956 --> 16:42.784
is gnarled
and shows discoloration.

16:42.827 --> 16:44.133
- No, not that.
There, at the top.

16:44.177 --> 16:46.005
- ShareChem Medical Laboratory.
Yeah, so?

16:46.048 --> 16:47.615
- So we thought it was
the doctor handing out

16:47.658 --> 16:49.095
fake diagnoses, but he's clean.

16:49.138 --> 16:51.053
However, the officers knew you
used ShareChem Lab,

16:51.097 --> 16:53.142
and that lab is owned
by David Share,

16:53.186 --> 16:56.058
brother of Nine-Nine officer
Michael Share.

16:56.102 --> 16:58.147
- The lab faked
the blood results.

16:58.191 --> 17:00.323
None of the officers
are actually sick,

17:00.367 --> 17:02.151
which means they have no excuse
to miss work.

17:02.195 --> 17:03.413
- Well, unfortunately,
that is--

17:03.457 --> 17:05.198
- Stop. I know you're gonna
twist my words

17:05.241 --> 17:07.765
into some vicious attack
on you and the NYPD.

17:07.809 --> 17:09.376
So, before you do that,

17:09.419 --> 17:11.291
I'd like the pleasure of making
the vicious attack myself.

17:11.334 --> 17:12.814
- Sir, your insults
are kind of known

17:12.857 --> 17:14.816
to be little too think-y,
maybe you should just let--

17:14.859 --> 17:17.688
- O'Sullivan,
you are a [bleep],

17:17.732 --> 17:22.084
and I hope your get
shoved right into your

17:22.128 --> 17:24.260
- Wow. Well, that was
definitely not too think-y.

17:24.304 --> 17:26.219
- Okay, okay, okay.
You got me.

17:26.262 --> 17:28.090
The men didn't have mono.
They weren't sick.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.526
- Damn right.
- But they are now.

17:29.570 --> 17:31.006
- What?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.660
- It seems they had a meeting,
and somebody showed up

17:32.703 --> 17:34.836
with a very bad stomach bug
and gave it to everyone there.

17:34.879 --> 17:38.883
I believe the officer's name
was a, uh, Lieutenant Jeffords.

17:38.927 --> 17:40.711
- The petard.

17:40.755 --> 17:44.063
It just won't stop hoisting.

17:46.456 --> 17:48.763
- Hey there, sir. You missed
the morning briefing.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.330
And I see you found
Charles' cheese.

17:50.373 --> 17:52.680
- Mmm, it pairs well
with despair

17:52.723 --> 17:56.336
and also this 1976
Chateau Haut-Brion.

17:56.379 --> 17:58.990
- Doesn't seem like the kind of
bottle you're supposed to chug.

17:59.034 --> 18:00.818
- I bought it
the day I joined the force

18:00.862 --> 18:02.777
with the intent to open it
when I became commissioner.

18:02.820 --> 18:04.344
- Oh, my gosh,
this is big news.

18:04.387 --> 18:05.736
Congratulations, sir.

18:05.780 --> 18:08.043
- No, he's not becoming
commissioner, Scully.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.219
- We can still fight
the Blue Flu.

18:10.263 --> 18:11.916
- It's over, Lieutenant.

18:11.960 --> 18:14.354
I have to cave
to O'Sullivan's demands.

18:14.397 --> 18:15.833
- Sir, you can't give up

18:15.877 --> 18:17.313
on all your hard work
because of one setback.

18:17.357 --> 18:18.836
- I'm a realist.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.491
I knew I wouldn't be able
to fix every problem,

18:21.535 --> 18:24.842
though I always imagined
I could fix some of them.

18:24.886 --> 18:28.716
But as a realist, I can now see
I haven't fixed a damn thing.

18:28.759 --> 18:31.501
The NYPD will never change.

18:31.545 --> 18:33.764
- Sir, if I may--
when I thought I was dying,

18:33.808 --> 18:36.289
all I could think about
was what a disappointment

18:36.332 --> 18:37.725
my life had been.

18:37.768 --> 18:39.509
But then Jake
went to town with me.

18:39.553 --> 18:40.989
- Common friendship phrase.

18:41.032 --> 18:43.252
- And it helped me realize
you can't focus

18:43.296 --> 18:44.993
on the things you didn't do.

18:45.036 --> 18:46.734
Focus on what you did do.

18:46.777 --> 18:49.867
And, more importantly,
focus on who you did it with.

18:49.911 --> 18:52.522
- Boyle, you're
absolutely right.

18:52.566 --> 18:54.437
- I am? My speech turned
your life around?

18:54.481 --> 18:56.396
- No, I found it trite
and uninspiring,

18:56.439 --> 18:57.875
but something you said
resonated.

18:57.919 --> 19:00.704
Focus on the things
you didn't do.

19:00.748 --> 19:02.445
- I said not to focus
on the things you didn't do.

19:02.489 --> 19:03.751
- Again, your speech
meant nothing.

19:03.794 --> 19:05.753
I'm just picking out
individual words.

19:05.796 --> 19:08.582
- Sure, sure, yeah.
- Hot damn.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.584
I know how to end the Blue Flu.

19:10.627 --> 19:12.890
I found a fifth prong.

19:12.934 --> 19:15.415
- So I gather you're ready
to cave to my demands.

19:15.458 --> 19:16.677
- Why would I do that?
- Give me a break.

19:16.720 --> 19:17.895
Your arrests are way down,

19:17.939 --> 19:19.375
and your CompStat numbers
are terrible.

19:19.419 --> 19:21.116
- I think those numbers
look great.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.031
- No, you don't.
- Well, not those numbers.

19:23.074 --> 19:24.902
Obviously, they make it look
like we haven't done much

19:24.946 --> 19:26.034
at all this week.

19:26.077 --> 19:27.818
But a friend of mine told me
something

19:27.862 --> 19:30.169
unintentionally interesting--
focus on what you didn't do.

19:30.212 --> 19:32.736
So here's what
we didn't do this week.

19:32.780 --> 19:35.130
With fewer officers
at our disposal

19:35.174 --> 19:37.741
and none of them trying
to hit CompStat numbers,

19:37.785 --> 19:39.787
we made fewer bad arrests.

19:39.830 --> 19:42.877
Number of complaints
against officers, down 32%.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.922
Number of cases thrown out
at arraignment

19:44.966 --> 19:47.098
for insufficient evidence,
down 34%.

19:47.142 --> 19:49.666
And here's the most
important thing we didn't do.

19:49.710 --> 19:51.929
We didn't make
the community less safe.

19:51.973 --> 19:53.801
Rates of major
and violent crime,

19:53.844 --> 19:55.455
what actually matters,
stayed the same.

19:55.498 --> 19:57.065
- What are you saying?

19:57.108 --> 19:59.415
- I'm saying the Nine-Nine
just became a case study

19:59.459 --> 20:00.721
for how a police force

20:00.764 --> 20:02.723
can work better
with fewer police.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.725
- Are you actually talking
about laying off cops?

20:04.768 --> 20:06.379
- If these numbers persist,
I may have no choice.

20:06.422 --> 20:07.728
- Then I'll just end
the Blue Flu.

20:07.771 --> 20:09.033
- Great. That's what I want.

20:09.077 --> 20:10.600
- Then I won't end
the Blue Flu.

20:10.644 --> 20:12.254
- Great. Fewer cops.
That's what I want.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.213
- You just said that--

20:15.866 --> 20:18.826
This is a very frustrating
conversation.

20:18.869 --> 20:20.349
<i>- I'd like
to officially announce</i>

20:20.393 --> 20:22.003
that the Blue Flu is over.

20:22.046 --> 20:24.005
The uniformed officers
are at work,

20:24.048 --> 20:25.789
and we sent
the Hitchcock-and-Scullys

20:25.833 --> 20:27.138
back to their home precincts.

20:27.182 --> 20:28.618
- So everything's back
to normal?

20:28.662 --> 20:29.967
- No, the opposite.

20:30.011 --> 20:31.839
We're gonna use
what we learned this week

20:31.882 --> 20:33.667
to change the way
the NYPD polices our streets.

20:33.710 --> 20:35.408
- Okay, awesome.
Very inspiring.

20:35.451 --> 20:36.800
Now, on to
more important things.

20:36.844 --> 20:40.761
I have obtained from Rosa
a photograph...

20:40.804 --> 20:42.589
of Captain Holt's tattoo.

20:42.632 --> 20:44.025
Oh.
-

20:44.068 --> 20:45.940
I'm sorry, Captain, but there's
nothing you can do

20:45.983 --> 20:47.289
that will stop me
from revealing

20:47.333 --> 20:52.294
that your secret
and embarrassing tattoo is...

20:52.338 --> 20:54.209
a dot?
- Huh?

20:54.253 --> 20:56.298
- It's a decimal point.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.953
Ah, what a first-thought
mathematical symbol.

20:58.996 --> 21:02.130
Might as well have gotten a
greater-than or equal-to sign.

21:02.173 --> 21:04.437
- I can't believe I spent
$2,000 on a dot.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.177
- You did?
- I know, Amy!

21:06.221 --> 21:08.354
We're both upset
about the same thing!

21:08.397 --> 21:09.790
I got to call Rosa.

21:14.838 --> 21:16.623
- Thank you for giving Peralta
the doctored photo.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.320
- My allegiances are
to the highest bidder.

21:18.364 --> 21:19.843
- And you'll never tell anyone
what you saw?

21:19.887 --> 21:21.280
- They wouldn't believe me
if I did.

21:21.323 --> 21:22.977
I mean, come on, sir.
It's a picture of--

21:23.020 --> 21:25.066
<i>- Not a doctor.
- Shh.</i>
