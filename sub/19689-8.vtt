00:01.033 --> 00:03.313
Previously on Underground...
We catch him tomorrow morning

00:03.337 --> 00:05.117
while he out riding.
Tell him where to meet us

00:05.141 --> 00:08.071
- after everybody gone to sleep.
- Help! Help!

00:08.172 --> 00:10.108
I'm carrying a child!

00:10.133 --> 00:12.917
That don't change nothing.

00:13.071 --> 00:14.929
If I help her kidnap
a number of free black folks,

00:14.953 --> 00:17.333
- she'll let us go.
- You're just a bad man.

00:19.753 --> 00:22.533
Paris is quite different than
it is here, even in the North.

00:22.633 --> 00:25.669
She's sneaky. And she planning to run.

00:26.933 --> 00:28.638
Hide the papers. Run as fast as you can.

01:41.152 --> 01:42.742
Merry Christmas.

01:43.203 --> 01:45.046
Is that what I think it is?

01:45.146 --> 01:47.580
He was passed out on top
of it in the drinking tent.

01:47.680 --> 01:50.000
Thought you might like to see
what he got to say about you.

01:52.020 --> 01:53.484
Sit down.

02:02.385 --> 02:06.101
"The strength of
one hundred warriors sat ready

02:06.126 --> 02:09.112
"at the end of the barrel
of her long-range rifle.

02:09.378 --> 02:11.813
"Ready to declare war
on whatever she ordered.

02:11.913 --> 02:14.025
"And while her convictions
would race like a bullet

02:14.102 --> 02:16.882
"through this complex world...

02:17.870 --> 02:19.609
"her trigger finger was shaky,

02:20.442 --> 02:22.338
"as if cursed

02:22.397 --> 02:24.140
by a singular question..."

02:24.850 --> 02:27.389
"Why haven't I caught Harriet Tubman?"

02:31.093 --> 02:33.013
Get out.

02:34.483 --> 02:35.995
Your plan to break your Black Rose

02:36.108 --> 02:38.236
ain't happening fast enough.

02:38.926 --> 02:41.552
You should be coming after the
queen herself, not her court.

02:41.652 --> 02:43.088
Show this butcher of words

02:43.188 --> 02:45.108
Harriet Tubman's
just another runaway nigger.

02:46.417 --> 02:48.195
Then she'll be a footnote in your story,

02:48.295 --> 02:50.192
instead of the other way around.

02:50.907 --> 02:52.419
Well, that's easier said than done.

02:52.519 --> 02:55.069
We came here because you know
she's workin' in the area.

02:55.169 --> 02:56.758
And if there was a map

02:57.493 --> 02:58.716
to all the safe houses
on the Underground,

02:58.740 --> 03:01.203
maybe that would be a start.

03:02.987 --> 03:04.669
Actually...

03:05.875 --> 03:07.107
there is.

03:09.961 --> 03:11.614
I once heard a song.

03:12.648 --> 03:13.777
I was told

03:13.877 --> 03:16.503
it, came from a man

03:16.603 --> 03:20.097
who wrote it on a prison wall
just before he died.

03:26.423 --> 03:27.866
Each verse

03:27.966 --> 03:29.716
a step along the way north.

03:30.968 --> 03:33.204
The moss. The blue haze.

03:33.304 --> 03:35.031
The wolf. The grave.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.887
They all led to the devil's grin.

03:39.166 --> 03:40.863
Which I ain't never seen.

03:42.093 --> 03:43.610
But if I was...

03:44.079 --> 03:46.490
fortunate enough to have seen that,

03:47.079 --> 03:48.832
then the next part of
the song would've led me

03:48.856 --> 03:51.467
to the angel's light.

03:55.038 --> 03:57.688
Sing it to me.

05:22.129 --> 05:25.140
Please! Not too tight.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.405
Rosalee, Miss Suzanna be clear.

05:27.505 --> 05:30.694
She said she wants you back
in that dress and back to work.

05:32.287 --> 05:33.759
We's could only let the dress out

05:33.784 --> 05:36.791
a little. Means this belly
got to come in a lot.

05:36.891 --> 05:40.366
James! T.R.! It's time to open presents!

05:47.938 --> 05:49.835
Boys!

06:24.544 --> 06:26.570
We should be on land. It's faster.

06:27.151 --> 06:29.122
By now they know she's missin'.

06:30.666 --> 06:32.849
Most likely, their rollers
are on the hunt.

06:47.728 --> 06:49.955
Out here, we're sitting
ducks is all I'm sayin'.

07:02.861 --> 07:05.624
Patty's tasked us both with
retrieving this property.

07:06.350 --> 07:08.137
It wouldn't be favorable
if she got stolen

07:08.237 --> 07:09.865
'cause you and I can't work together.

07:10.543 --> 07:12.000
Be quiet.

07:14.440 --> 07:15.997
Who's Patty?

07:16.912 --> 07:18.566
Patty Cannon?

07:21.458 --> 07:23.290
What's she want with me?

07:29.915 --> 07:31.989
Well, she has business
with your daughter.

07:32.839 --> 07:34.759
Shut your mouth.

07:46.246 --> 07:48.066
That's four dollars for a dozen.

07:48.953 --> 07:51.817
How about I give you two
dollars for a baker's dozen?

07:51.842 --> 07:53.585
Well, sir, everything is priced as is.

07:53.685 --> 07:55.835
And all of it in line
with the free produce movement.

07:55.912 --> 07:58.539
- What does that mean?
- Nothing is made with slave labor.

07:58.639 --> 08:02.033
For example, in these cookies,
we substituted honey for the...

08:02.730 --> 08:03.776
sugar.

08:03.876 --> 08:06.271
That's her. It is.

08:07.834 --> 08:10.746
I'll take all of it.
I'll probably get a toothache,

08:10.846 --> 08:13.169
but it's a sacrifice
I'm willing to make for a cause.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.980
Welcome back.

08:18.821 --> 08:20.641
How was hearing Harriet speak?

08:21.038 --> 08:22.561
Life-changing.

08:22.661 --> 08:24.481
She's inside.

08:24.581 --> 08:27.038
She's come for the money for
Noah and Rosalee's return trip.

08:27.115 --> 08:28.551
Georgia!

08:28.651 --> 08:31.047
Any chance
that you actually will be able

08:31.147 --> 08:32.506
to purchase all of this?

08:32.606 --> 08:33.697
Is it that bad?

08:33.966 --> 08:35.155
It seems that the Christmas spirit

08:35.179 --> 08:37.575
is not inspiring charity this year.

08:37.674 --> 08:39.687
I noticed it was emptier
than usual inside.

08:39.787 --> 08:42.513
Boarders have steadily
declined since the raid.

08:44.446 --> 08:46.238
There have been rumors about me.

08:47.918 --> 08:49.285
Elizabeth Hawkes.

08:49.805 --> 08:52.020
I knew that was you!

08:53.086 --> 08:56.328
Laney. I haven't seen you
in a long time.

08:56.417 --> 08:58.237
And I take full blame for that.

08:58.337 --> 09:00.003
I just want to let you know

09:00.103 --> 09:03.714
Dean and I are deeply sorry
that we missed John's funeral.

09:04.081 --> 09:05.182
We were in India.

09:05.207 --> 09:08.512
Again. The culture there
is just so robust.

09:09.162 --> 09:11.725
Laney, this is my friend Georgia.

09:11.750 --> 09:12.840
Nice to meet you.

09:13.562 --> 09:14.695
You know,

09:14.720 --> 09:16.760
I think what y'all are doing
here is just wonderful.

09:16.899 --> 09:18.727
Helping the Negroes.

09:18.752 --> 09:21.532
And, Elizabeth, I think it's
so noble of you to participate.

09:21.707 --> 09:24.779
And, of course, you as well,
considering your ties to it.

09:26.203 --> 09:27.943
I'm glad you think so,

09:28.043 --> 09:29.286
because we could really use your help.

09:29.310 --> 09:32.627
You know, I tried
reading a book accounting

09:32.727 --> 09:34.239
for the conditions of the slaves, but,

09:34.263 --> 09:37.121
I must confess, I couldn't
get past the first few pages.

09:37.168 --> 09:39.487
What a vile institution slavery is.

09:39.701 --> 09:42.517
Well, any donation that you
could make would go a long way

09:42.575 --> 09:43.704
to helping end it.

09:44.392 --> 09:46.173
I'd love to, of course.

09:46.273 --> 09:47.940
Unfortunately, I can't spend any money

09:48.040 --> 09:49.552
without my husband's blessing.

09:49.652 --> 09:51.741
It's a shame, really. If there's anyone

09:51.841 --> 09:55.120
who can identify with the plight
of the slave, it's us women.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.810
I really should get going.

09:56.910 --> 09:58.730
It was so great to see you.

09:58.830 --> 10:00.496
Maybe we can do tea soon.

10:00.596 --> 10:02.516
Just the two of us.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.260
Help!

10:23.442 --> 10:25.300
You alone?

10:26.610 --> 10:28.584
Who you tell we was here?

10:30.310 --> 10:32.221
You was the only one that knew.

10:32.824 --> 10:34.491
James, he the one...

10:34.551 --> 10:36.601
What about James?

10:37.015 --> 10:38.758
He told!

10:42.468 --> 10:44.518
You blamin' me,

10:44.618 --> 10:47.014
when y'all changed the plan.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.664
What was Rosalee doin' in the big house?

10:48.688 --> 10:51.113
You comin' back, that was the plan.

10:51.138 --> 10:53.135
Miss Suzanna called me up
to the cookhouse to help

10:53.160 --> 10:55.000
- with Christmas dinner.
- Rose thought you turned on us.

10:55.024 --> 10:56.498
It's why she went out there,
got herself caught.

10:56.522 --> 10:58.918
I should've never let you
drag me into this mess.

10:59.018 --> 11:00.454
Y'all crazy!

11:00.554 --> 11:02.960
Comin' back here
while she carryin' a child.

11:08.165 --> 11:09.463
You ain't know.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.323
I got to get her back.

11:16.348 --> 11:17.489
How?

11:17.603 --> 11:20.728
Miss Suzanna ain't never gonna
let her out of the big house.

11:20.753 --> 11:22.251
If it's one thing
I learned on my way

11:22.276 --> 11:24.356
up out of here, power ain't
about places of position.

11:24.403 --> 11:26.050
It's about people.

11:28.012 --> 11:30.408
Yeah, we take the mistress,
we own the house,

11:30.508 --> 11:32.213
walk right out the front door.

11:33.202 --> 11:34.618
Takin' the mistress?

11:34.910 --> 11:36.704
That ain't gonna be easy.

11:36.729 --> 11:38.587
It's gonna be next to impossible.

11:39.264 --> 11:41.414
That's why we need someone
on the inside.

11:49.275 --> 11:52.362
- Now that one.
- Yes, massa.

11:58.299 --> 11:59.935
- Bring me that one.
- Yes, massa.

12:16.848 --> 12:18.284
That will be

12:18.384 --> 12:20.388
perfect with your new pony.

12:20.488 --> 12:22.109
Really? I get my own horse?

12:22.968 --> 12:24.390
You got him a horse?

12:25.263 --> 12:27.485
Perhaps if you hadn't torn
all your church clothes

12:27.510 --> 12:29.110
rolling around in the
dirt like a nigger,

12:29.136 --> 12:31.225
you could have had a
new saddle, as well.

12:31.325 --> 12:32.995
My James behaves himself

12:33.095 --> 12:37.424
like a good little boy,
so, he gets a new horse.

13:19.739 --> 13:21.397
Don't you know

13:21.497 --> 13:22.779
your place?

13:22.879 --> 13:24.277
Nothing's changed.

13:24.377 --> 13:26.873
You're supposed to be in
the cookhouse by now.

13:49.025 --> 13:51.766
Make sure you eat
while you're out there.

13:52.235 --> 13:53.402
I want

13:53.427 --> 13:55.424
my property nice and healthy.

14:02.328 --> 14:04.877
If we can't find
the money for the train,

14:05.426 --> 14:06.989
what will they do?

14:07.014 --> 14:08.988
It'll add about a week to their journey.

14:09.163 --> 14:12.414
And the way they comin',
ain't got many safe houses.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.185
Train tickets

14:14.210 --> 14:15.587
could mean life or death.

14:15.612 --> 14:17.187
Georgia is eating herself out
of a house and home, and then,

14:17.211 --> 14:20.334
people like Laney Briss...
they feel bad, and then

14:20.359 --> 14:22.160
they traipse around the subcontinent,

14:22.185 --> 14:24.105
wasting money to feel cultured.

14:26.273 --> 14:29.437
I am so tired
of begging even good people

14:29.537 --> 14:30.970
to join the fight.

14:32.857 --> 14:34.775
When I had to go back for my father,

14:34.875 --> 14:36.925
I didn't have a penny to my name.

14:38.476 --> 14:40.411
The Lord got it into my head

14:40.436 --> 14:41.940
that I needed to go to the office of

14:41.965 --> 14:46.426
Oliver Johnson in New York City,
ask him for money.

14:46.451 --> 14:47.768
He refused.

14:49.094 --> 14:50.837
Was he an abolitionist?

14:50.862 --> 14:54.167
He was, but for him, $20 was too much.

14:55.739 --> 14:57.421
I refused to accept that.

14:58.003 --> 15:00.522
So I sat there in his office,
night and day.

15:01.020 --> 15:04.162
People passing in and out,
but I wouldn't move.

15:05.444 --> 15:07.433
I believed in the Lord.

15:08.450 --> 15:10.423
In his message and his plan.

15:10.523 --> 15:14.094
And Mr. Johnson ultimately
gave you the money.

15:15.630 --> 15:17.886
Ultimately, I got my $20, and then some,

15:18.360 --> 15:20.292
tucked into my pocket while I slept.

15:20.983 --> 15:24.846
By the people who passed
through, asking about my plight.

15:26.956 --> 15:28.994
That's amazing.

15:31.114 --> 15:33.425
The Lord is on our side.

15:34.292 --> 15:36.277
We just got to do our part.

15:38.062 --> 15:41.093
Sometimes I'm not sure
I understand my part.

15:46.119 --> 15:48.846
When's the last time you prayed?

15:55.899 --> 15:58.464
Yeah.

16:00.474 --> 16:03.062
Miss Suzanna continuing
massa's tradition

16:03.087 --> 16:05.980
of inviting his most exceptional
niggas up for Christmas dinner.

16:06.005 --> 16:08.632
They gonna be in the
big house all night.

16:09.230 --> 16:11.441
One of 'em got to be our inside man.

16:11.595 --> 16:12.733
Tell me what you know

16:12.758 --> 16:15.044
- about this year's guests.
- Mack

16:15.280 --> 16:17.292
be tough as nails.

16:17.846 --> 16:20.012
He's bested men twice his size,

16:20.037 --> 16:21.396
'cause he's strong, for sure,

16:21.421 --> 16:22.728
but mostly 'cause he never give up.

16:22.752 --> 16:24.994
Them rollers get into it,

16:25.262 --> 16:26.506
I'd want him on my side.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.974
Yeah. I remember Josiah.

16:29.101 --> 16:30.921
Smart as a whip.

16:31.021 --> 16:32.841
Knows when to keep his head down.

16:32.941 --> 16:35.718
Wouldn't nobody suspect him
make a move like this.

16:35.743 --> 16:37.102
And there's July.

16:37.127 --> 16:39.024
She run rough with the boys.

16:39.488 --> 16:41.500
Ain't afraid to rub their nose
in the dirt

16:41.525 --> 16:42.984
when she done beat them, neither.

16:43.009 --> 16:44.598
Wouldn't be scared,

16:44.623 --> 16:46.923
things get violent. And Walter.

16:46.995 --> 16:49.007
Walter, he too wild, unpredictable.

16:49.107 --> 16:50.874
He's just as likely to kill Miss Suzanna

16:50.951 --> 16:52.195
if we bring him in on this.

16:52.295 --> 16:54.230
Hell, maybe even if we don't.

16:54.330 --> 16:56.419
Yeah, they all doin' anything they can

16:56.519 --> 16:57.763
to get up to the big house

16:57.863 --> 16:59.183
for a nice dinner with the white folks.

16:59.207 --> 17:02.536
We pick the wrong one, it's over.

17:02.719 --> 17:04.462
Who can you trust

17:04.487 --> 17:06.829
when you can't even trust family?

17:35.488 --> 17:37.215
Can I have some?

17:50.464 --> 17:52.615
I told you the rollers caught up.

17:59.156 --> 18:00.732
The size of that plantation,

18:00.757 --> 18:02.456
we're sure to be outnumbered.

18:06.512 --> 18:07.936
You see 'em?

18:13.927 --> 18:15.847
Goddamn it!

18:35.140 --> 18:37.548
Goddamn it! What the hell
is wrong with you?! -

18:37.573 --> 18:40.353
Now I'm soaked through.
How you gonna escape

18:40.453 --> 18:42.811
if you can't swim?

18:43.471 --> 18:46.113
What's that? What you got?

18:46.641 --> 18:48.955
What...? Well.

18:49.055 --> 18:51.881
I guess you ain't
the only one with a vice.

18:51.981 --> 18:54.824
It's like I'm traveling
with a church revival group.

18:58.818 --> 19:00.253
At least that solves the problem.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.595
Once the withdrawals kick in,

19:04.060 --> 19:07.167
even if she wants to run,
only place she's gonna go is

19:07.267 --> 19:09.163
right back to you.

19:10.039 --> 19:11.160
Get up.

19:13.564 --> 19:15.461
They're trying to cut off the boat.

19:20.528 --> 19:21.987
We got to move back into the trees.

19:24.675 --> 19:26.226
Come on!

19:40.626 --> 19:42.053
Who's there?

19:44.158 --> 19:45.786
Who are you?

19:45.811 --> 19:46.857
Noah.

19:48.982 --> 19:52.857
Good. You know who I am,
so I'm gonna just get to it.

19:54.033 --> 19:56.024
I just found out I'm gonna be a father,

19:56.124 --> 19:57.604
which means you're gonna be an uncle,

19:57.660 --> 19:59.903
so that makes us family.

19:59.928 --> 20:02.071
Me, your sister and my baby's life

20:02.096 --> 20:05.107
she risked for yours
is family, not the Macons.

20:05.494 --> 20:07.299
Miss Suzanna been the one
takin' care of me.

20:07.375 --> 20:08.926
She also the one who put
your sister in Bill's path

20:08.950 --> 20:10.790
to take them lashes for you.
You remember that?

20:11.649 --> 20:13.253
When you ran in front of that wagon?

20:14.002 --> 20:16.011
Your sister took all that hurt for you.

20:16.111 --> 20:18.180
And I know she ain't gonna want
to leave here without you,

20:18.204 --> 20:20.050
even after what you did.

20:20.150 --> 20:23.736
But what you need to know
about me is I protect mines,

20:23.836 --> 20:26.070
- no matter what.
- Why didn't you stop him?

20:26.170 --> 20:29.445
- Who?
- Mr. Bill with the whip?

20:29.545 --> 20:31.516
Why ain't you protect her?

20:34.157 --> 20:35.430
I'm gonna get 'em back.

20:36.531 --> 20:39.042
And I ain't gonna let
nobody stop me, not even you.

20:39.736 --> 20:41.845
So you got a decision to make.

20:42.249 --> 20:44.163
Is you part of this family,

20:44.188 --> 20:45.870
or not?

21:07.388 --> 21:09.207
There's a church
on the other side of the river

21:09.231 --> 21:12.382
- in Covington, St Augustine's.
- I've heard of it.

21:12.482 --> 21:14.322
It's a mouthpiece for the
pro-slavery movement.

21:14.377 --> 21:16.835
They run a small
printing press in the basement,

21:16.911 --> 21:21.045
putting out pieces that link
slavery to godliness.

21:21.145 --> 21:22.955
Now the God I know ain't
support slavery, and ain't

21:22.979 --> 21:26.128
- never be found in place like that.
- Christmas Day.

21:26.182 --> 21:28.616
The church will be filled,
which is both good and bad.

21:28.716 --> 21:32.019
More money, but more eyes watching.

21:33.670 --> 21:35.912
But too many new faces
might draw attention.

21:36.012 --> 21:38.255
Only if they white faces.

21:38.355 --> 21:41.044
It is important on the day

21:41.074 --> 21:45.969
of our Lord's birth to pay
honor to the Christmas star

21:46.069 --> 21:49.342
that pointed the world in his direction.

21:50.176 --> 21:52.115
Unto the manger,

21:52.215 --> 21:54.879
where our pale savior was born,

21:54.979 --> 21:59.219
there came three kings, and
they bestowed upon him gifts.

21:59.939 --> 22:01.551
We'll need a distraction.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.711
- A good one.
- "Nor let us try the Lord,

22:03.811 --> 22:07.324
as some of them did, and were
destroyed by the serpents."

22:07.536 --> 22:10.047
Corinthians 10:9.

22:11.328 --> 22:13.302
From that day forward...

22:14.861 --> 22:17.745
per the Lord's decree...

22:19.584 --> 22:22.864
the people of the Lord became free.

22:36.519 --> 22:38.032
Thieves!

22:38.132 --> 22:39.760
Sinners!

22:39.860 --> 22:43.462
Stealing from the Lord
on the day his son was born!

22:43.562 --> 22:46.484
- You miserable thieves!
- Be quiet, turn around

22:46.584 --> 22:49.011
or I will show you a real sinner.

22:51.727 --> 22:54.722
Ain't nothing wrong with a
little sin for the greater good.

23:07.207 --> 23:08.720
I need to stop for a moment.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.740
No stops.

23:22.874 --> 23:25.424
Looks to me like we're heading north.

23:25.524 --> 23:27.113
With catchers, it's usually
the other way around.

23:27.137 --> 23:29.057
Shut up. Keep moving.

23:39.663 --> 23:41.921
What happened to Rosalee?

23:46.085 --> 23:47.939
How about your boy?

23:48.427 --> 23:49.633
What happened to him?

23:49.733 --> 23:52.589
You was with him the last time.

23:52.689 --> 23:55.377
Ben, wasn't it?

23:57.886 --> 23:59.422
You had two boys, right?

24:00.422 --> 24:01.905
What happened to them?

24:06.728 --> 24:07.780
Shit.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.278
How'd they find us? Shh.

24:09.378 --> 24:11.428
Been covering your tracks?

24:11.528 --> 24:13.448
Of course I did.

24:31.324 --> 24:32.913
Put your gun away, it's just a loon.

24:33.013 --> 24:34.795
Are you sure?

24:35.020 --> 24:37.790
What the hell you doing?
What the hell is this?

24:39.470 --> 24:41.610
Son of a bitch.

24:41.635 --> 24:45.029
Look at this.
She's tearing off scraps.

24:45.171 --> 24:47.131
They could be picking up
this trail she's leaving.

24:47.474 --> 24:49.217
How do you know it ain't them rollers?

24:49.437 --> 24:51.102
Well...

24:51.319 --> 24:52.861
maybe 'cause...

24:55.406 --> 24:57.672
'cause there ain't no trail.

24:58.990 --> 25:01.901
You jumped off that boat
to get us back on land.

25:02.356 --> 25:03.316
Now, how do you know they ain't

25:03.341 --> 25:04.315
gonna be worse to you than we are

25:04.340 --> 25:05.789
if they catch up to us?

25:05.889 --> 25:08.324
They ain't got ambitions on my kin.

25:08.424 --> 25:10.128
You mean I been wet
all damn day for nothing?

25:10.152 --> 25:13.216
I don't give a shit
what Patty wants with you.

25:13.316 --> 25:15.851
You try anything else, and I
will pull the trigger myself.

25:15.902 --> 25:17.822
You hear me?

25:22.510 --> 25:24.430
Let's go.

25:47.393 --> 25:49.174
What are you doing in here?

25:49.785 --> 25:50.864
Cleaning.

25:51.259 --> 25:53.628
I heard my mother tell you to get
wine from the cellar for dinner.

25:53.652 --> 25:55.740
It was whiskey she ask for,
and it wasn't in the cellar,

25:55.764 --> 25:57.542
so I thought it might be here.

25:57.619 --> 25:59.539
It was our father's favorite.

26:04.224 --> 26:06.144
I don't believe you.

26:07.073 --> 26:08.909
Hattie!

26:10.637 --> 26:12.557
Yes, Massa T.R.

26:15.513 --> 26:18.169
You want to hit somebody, hit me.

26:19.645 --> 26:21.696
I'm-a have you whipped for touching me.

26:21.796 --> 26:23.716
Stop it!

26:25.895 --> 26:27.293
Don't you ever tell me what to do.

26:27.393 --> 26:28.791
Mother!

26:28.891 --> 26:30.811
Be quiet.

26:41.179 --> 26:43.642
- Go.
- Yes, Massa James.

26:49.830 --> 26:51.750
Just now you remind me so much of Momma.

26:52.315 --> 26:54.019
Why did you come back here?

26:54.486 --> 26:57.074
For you. To take you away from all this.

26:57.237 --> 26:58.520
Sam got kilt 'cause he ran.

26:58.620 --> 26:59.786
I ain't gonna let nobody hurt you.

26:59.810 --> 27:01.899
I ain't scared of nobody hurting me.

27:02.856 --> 27:05.060
I'm scared of you making
everything bad again.

27:05.740 --> 27:07.594
Before you left, everything was fine.

27:07.694 --> 27:09.614
I was happy.

27:10.752 --> 27:12.226
Sam, Momma...

27:12.326 --> 27:14.140
it's your fault they gone.

27:15.680 --> 27:18.192
I'm sorry, James, I'm sorry.

27:18.217 --> 27:19.653
I know it ain't been easy on you,

27:19.968 --> 27:22.978
but this here, this a lie.

27:23.078 --> 27:25.628
You pretending to be
Miss Suzanna's son is a lie.

27:25.728 --> 27:26.780
You're my brother.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.277
I'm the one that love you.

27:28.937 --> 27:30.857
And I ain't goin' nowhere without you.

27:32.154 --> 27:33.570
I saw Noah.

27:34.786 --> 27:37.032
He say he comin' back for you.

27:38.854 --> 27:42.502
I ain't tellin', but I'm stayin'.

27:46.842 --> 27:48.334
This is my family now.

28:26.308 --> 28:27.833
My boys.

28:29.825 --> 28:31.864
You asked earlier.

28:33.764 --> 28:35.162
What about my boys?

28:35.262 --> 28:37.745
Where are they, how did they fare?

28:39.140 --> 28:41.920
Well, my oldest was hung by the massa,

28:42.020 --> 28:45.991
and my youngest is being raised
by the mistress.

28:46.978 --> 28:49.984
Not a day goes by I don't wonder
which one I let down more.

28:51.971 --> 28:53.272
Sam was my favorite.

28:55.945 --> 28:57.033
He didn't know it,

28:58.131 --> 28:59.767
but he was my heart.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.696
God touched him in a way

29:04.796 --> 29:07.294
that the world would never
have treated him fair.

29:09.826 --> 29:11.430
But James...

29:11.823 --> 29:13.574
that was on me.

29:16.765 --> 29:18.915
After Sam, I grew angry.

29:20.002 --> 29:21.438
Spiteful.

29:22.104 --> 29:25.010
And I hung him, the massa.

29:25.541 --> 29:27.965
I didn't know how it would
affect James, but...

29:30.029 --> 29:32.943
Hell, maybe I did
and I chose not to care.

29:38.646 --> 29:39.818
You daughter.

29:41.219 --> 29:43.292
I had her in my hands.

29:46.902 --> 29:49.242
Had my land paid for.

29:50.966 --> 29:52.517
Could have just walked away

29:52.617 --> 29:54.091
from all of this shit.

29:55.609 --> 29:58.003
Just had to keep pushing.

29:58.837 --> 30:00.246
Keep...

30:02.669 --> 30:03.768
driving.

30:03.868 --> 30:06.581
Get the blacksmith, get the driver.

30:18.555 --> 30:20.035
He got hurt, um...

30:24.309 --> 30:26.268
Took my eyes off him and he got hurt.

30:34.518 --> 30:36.438
I shouldn't've had him with me.

30:38.301 --> 30:40.221
It was selfish.

30:43.256 --> 30:45.944
I might as well have just been
holding that knife myself.

30:49.034 --> 30:53.330
Just wanted to... teach him something.

30:54.362 --> 30:57.286
But I ain't, you know, never got...

30:58.162 --> 31:00.443
I ain't never had nothing.

31:04.051 --> 31:06.046
I... I had nothing to...

31:29.795 --> 31:31.346
Don't matter what we got

31:31.446 --> 31:33.650
or don't got.

31:33.750 --> 31:35.824
We got to give it all to 'em.

31:37.398 --> 31:39.932
They always be our babies.

31:42.044 --> 31:45.055
Time don't get to take that away.

31:46.167 --> 31:47.327
We don't even get that right,

31:47.969 --> 31:50.627
no matter how hard we fail at it.

31:55.542 --> 31:58.453
Maybe the only way to fail 'em...

32:00.301 --> 32:02.221
is to give up on it altogether.

32:25.798 --> 32:26.912
Merry Christmas.

32:26.989 --> 32:28.823
Come. Sit.

32:28.923 --> 32:30.460
Come, come, come.

32:30.560 --> 32:32.457
Here, sit. Sit.

32:32.557 --> 32:34.684
There she is. How was church?

32:34.784 --> 32:37.257
There you go.

32:42.126 --> 32:43.911
The church collection
money was just enough

32:43.956 --> 32:44.759
to get the tickets

32:44.784 --> 32:46.704
for Rosalee's family.

32:47.991 --> 32:50.272
How are we gonna keep the station open?

32:50.745 --> 32:52.883
We'll figure it out.

32:52.983 --> 32:54.458
As long as this house is standing,

32:54.558 --> 32:57.222
it will be a safe haven for runaways.

32:57.322 --> 32:59.496
- Amen.
- Amen.

32:59.521 --> 33:01.117
Merry Christmas, Elizabeth.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.554
Where you going?

33:38.484 --> 33:41.356
I need to relieve myself.

33:43.173 --> 33:45.196
Unless you want me to do it right here.

33:47.778 --> 33:49.456
There's too much fog.

33:49.481 --> 33:52.223
I won't be able to keep my eye on you.

33:53.209 --> 33:55.802
Good thing you got me tied up, then.

33:57.851 --> 33:59.661
Now be quick about it.

34:01.179 --> 34:03.138
Go on.

34:48.829 --> 34:50.748
The hell?

35:00.150 --> 35:01.471
Pullman!

35:01.571 --> 35:03.775
She's running!

35:37.579 --> 35:39.092
Get up. Come on.

35:39.192 --> 35:41.012
Hey.

36:30.123 --> 36:32.096
Here, gonna have to fix your arm.

36:32.196 --> 36:34.424
Go on.

37:14.873 --> 37:18.697
I ain't leavin' this plantation
with you still breathin'.

37:25.741 --> 37:28.060
Get on up, Bill. Come on.

37:48.829 --> 37:50.749
Shit.

37:53.146 --> 37:54.006
Here we go.

37:54.106 --> 37:56.141
Give up.

38:43.879 --> 38:45.123
Good evening, Laney.

38:45.223 --> 38:46.621
Elizabeth.

38:46.721 --> 38:48.272
It's late. What are you...?

38:48.372 --> 38:50.292
I came to collect your donation.

38:51.360 --> 38:53.218
You said you wanted
to get behind the cause,

38:53.318 --> 38:54.754
and I'm here to help you do that.

38:55.732 --> 38:57.788
Elizabeth, it's Christmas,
and my family...

38:57.888 --> 39:00.460
There isn't a better time
to give to those who need.

39:02.242 --> 39:03.893
Listen, I won't be donating

39:03.993 --> 39:05.875
to anything that Georgia woman
is involved with.

39:05.952 --> 39:07.464
So if you excuse me,

39:07.564 --> 39:09.653
I wish you all the luck.

39:09.753 --> 39:12.149
I don't want your wishes or your luck.

39:13.334 --> 39:14.694
I don't want your fake condolences

39:14.755 --> 39:16.652
or your fashion tips from Paris.

39:16.752 --> 39:18.303
They're all empty.

39:18.902 --> 39:20.223
Just like this is.

39:21.048 --> 39:22.834
What I want

39:23.233 --> 39:25.330
is for you to fill it.

39:25.920 --> 39:27.327
With what?

39:27.427 --> 39:29.910
Cash. Coins. Jewelry.
Whatever you've got right now.

39:31.254 --> 39:34.239
You're not the only one
who's heard rumors, Laney.

39:34.339 --> 39:35.929
I've heard a few.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.881
About you and Max Collins.

39:38.972 --> 39:40.216
Trevor Forrest.

39:40.316 --> 39:42.327
And I... I can't remember
the name of the French masseuse.

39:42.351 --> 39:43.403
So what?

39:43.503 --> 39:44.666
You're going to tell Dean

39:44.691 --> 39:46.421
unless I give you a donation? I am.

39:46.422 --> 39:48.856
I'm going to threaten
to tell him every month

39:48.956 --> 39:50.756
when I come back for more money.

39:52.067 --> 39:54.424
I think there's a good person
in there, Laney.

39:54.981 --> 39:57.404
I think you just need help
in finding her.

40:17.818 --> 40:19.738
We're headed south.

40:53.192 --> 40:54.667
Who can you trust

40:54.767 --> 40:57.201
when you can't even trust family?

40:59.948 --> 41:01.269
I'd like to make a toast.

41:01.679 --> 41:04.321
This past year

41:04.421 --> 41:06.532
has challenged all of us.

41:06.946 --> 41:10.199
A series of plagues struck our home

41:10.299 --> 41:12.828
and forced us to reinvent ourselves.

41:13.521 --> 41:15.343
But here we are.

41:15.593 --> 41:16.990
Still standing.

41:17.090 --> 41:20.523
Still smiling, still celebrating.

41:20.623 --> 41:24.133
Tom, God rest his soul, was, perhaps,

41:24.233 --> 41:27.858
not man enough to handle
what the South demanded.

41:27.958 --> 41:29.317
But he will be remembered

41:29.417 --> 41:32.850
as a planter who was
notoriously kind to his slaves.

41:33.809 --> 41:34.976
We carry on his legacy

41:35.076 --> 41:38.025
with this shared Christmas feast

41:38.125 --> 41:40.474
to celebrate the work

41:40.574 --> 41:43.140
that we have all done together.

41:44.369 --> 41:46.289
Who's our inside man?

41:49.210 --> 41:51.354
And despite the interfamily tensions

41:51.454 --> 41:52.918
of the past year,

41:53.018 --> 41:56.249
I feel that we have all grown stronger.

41:56.349 --> 42:00.078
My James is a shining example.

42:00.158 --> 42:02.516
His father's good blood won out

42:02.616 --> 42:04.536
over the bad blood of his mother's.

42:06.371 --> 42:08.806
We can't trust anyone.

42:09.259 --> 42:11.179
Nobody move!

42:13.521 --> 42:15.687
Rose, James, let's go.

42:15.787 --> 42:17.184
Don't hurt her!

42:17.284 --> 42:18.720
Rose!

42:25.118 --> 42:27.164
You won't get far.

42:27.275 --> 42:29.095
James is my son now.

42:29.120 --> 42:31.040
- Get in.
- Hold on.

42:33.588 --> 42:35.623
Let my mother go.

42:37.317 --> 42:39.291
Let her go now.

42:39.331 --> 42:41.226
Easy.

42:53.804 --> 42:55.086
You okay, you hit? You hit?

42:55.111 --> 42:57.031
Rose? You good?

43:08.223 --> 43:12.231
No matter where you go,
my catchers will find you

43:12.331 --> 43:13.844
and drag you back.

43:14.598 --> 43:16.823
Nobody gon' be dragged back here.

43:16.874 --> 43:19.086
'Cause there ain't gon' be
no place to come back to.

43:30.163 --> 43:32.981
No!

43:35.500 --> 43:37.627
No!

43:57.801 --> 43:59.114
We've got cargo.

44:01.227 --> 44:03.086
He saw the lantern in the window.

44:03.186 --> 44:04.775
I directed him through the tunnel.

44:04.875 --> 44:07.079
He's a bit jumpy.

44:07.802 --> 44:09.108
I think he's been through a lot.

44:09.185 --> 44:11.105
Understood.

44:20.705 --> 44:22.678
A friend of a friend sent me.
