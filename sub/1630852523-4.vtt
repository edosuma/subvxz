00:13.972 --> 00:15.890


00:24.274 --> 00:25.650
Call Mom.

00:25.734 --> 00:26.860
<i>Calling Mom.</i>

00:27.444 --> 00:29.529
- <i>Hello?</i>
-Hi, Mommy.

00:29.612 --> 00:31.865

<i>Hi, Baby Dragun. How are you?</i>

00:31.948 --> 00:35.869
Hmm, I'm surviving.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.497
<i>Well, it's a big bad world out there.</i>

00:39.581 --> 00:40.415
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:40.498 --> 00:43.209
Just, like, another day,
another drama as always with me.

00:43.293 --> 00:48.048
There was this little girl, Trisha Paytas,
and she tweeted, basically, down-playing

00:48.131 --> 00:51.593
me having a second season
of my <i>Nikita Unfiltered </i>show,

00:51.676 --> 00:56.264
with like all these like laughing faces
and, like, "Oh, you know, on Snapchat."

00:56.347 --> 00:59.017
And so, I just, like,
tweeted her back, and I was like,

00:59.100 --> 01:02.937
"Yeah, I mean, 30 million views
and a billboard on Sunset."

01:03.021 --> 01:06.232
"But let me go back to filming
my Netflix show, right?" It wasn't even--

01:11.863 --> 01:14.532
I could have come for her,
I really could have.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.993
But I was like,
"Let me try to take the higher road."

01:17.077 --> 01:20.121
And I just stated facts, you know?
Like, that was just a fact.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.332
<i>That's all you gotta do.</i>

01:22.415 --> 01:25.001
<i>There's a lot of people</i>
<i>that make the comments on the sideline,</i>

01:25.085 --> 01:29.464
<i>but very few people</i>
<i>put the work and dedication that it takes.</i>

01:30.465 --> 01:33.468
Okay, look, it was not easy
for me to get to where I am.

01:33.551 --> 01:36.971
No one held my hand,
there was no one I could look up to,

01:37.055 --> 01:39.724
and I think that's what people
get confused a lot about me.

01:39.808 --> 01:42.519
They think I'm problematic
because I'll tweet this,

01:42.602 --> 01:44.270
or I'll do this, or I'll post that,

01:44.354 --> 01:48.608
and I think it's because
I've held back for so long in my life,

01:48.691 --> 01:51.194
and I didn't even think
I would get this far.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.488
So I'm like,
"What's the worst that can happen?"

01:53.571 --> 01:55.907
I think you've seen it
from obviously the early days.

01:55.990 --> 01:59.786
Like, I'm-- I feel like I've always
just had, like, my back against the wall,

01:59.869 --> 02:02.580
and it's always just felt
like the world against me.

02:03.164 --> 02:07.460
You know, me on this damn conquest
to conquer the damn world

02:07.544 --> 02:11.131
is gonna drive me
as like Khaleesi mad queen

02:11.214 --> 02:14.384
burning down this whole damn city
until I get what I want.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.219
-And I'll do it.

02:17.178 --> 02:19.931
If y'all are gonna hate me,
you're gonna really hate me.

02:20.014 --> 02:22.392
But I can take it.
I can take a lot of things.

02:22.475 --> 02:25.687
Once I let go, I aim for the jugular.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.154


02:43.163 --> 02:44.080
Whoo!

02:44.164 --> 02:46.249
-That was sketchy.
-You do that every time.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.877
It feels so good
to be skating right now.

02:49.419 --> 02:52.630
So, Alex, you ready
to get married?

02:52.714 --> 02:55.383
-Why is everyone forgetting this is fake?
-I'm excited.

02:55.466 --> 02:58.136
-Wait, it's fake?
-I'm treating it as real as possible.

02:58.219 --> 03:00.430


03:00.513 --> 03:02.557
So you guys have been asking for a while.

03:02.640 --> 03:07.061
I recently posted a video
where I did 100,000 views less than usual.

03:07.145 --> 03:09.480
I needed something crazier than normal.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.192
And I thought,
how funny would it be to plan a wedding,

03:12.275 --> 03:14.068
and had it in a day?

03:14.152 --> 03:17.197
Kouvr, will you fake marry me
for 24 hours?

03:17.280 --> 03:18.281
I'll marry you.

03:20.658 --> 03:23.286
A fake wedding's great content.
Everyone wants a marriage.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.622
And I think
we'll get a lot of views off that.

03:25.705 --> 03:28.833
If this video goes viral,
I'm taking credit. Such a good idea.

03:28.917 --> 03:33.129
I was having fun with it, I tweeted,
"Hi, this is Alex and my wife Kouvr."

03:35.715 --> 03:37.884
-Go!
-Oh my gosh. Why does he run like that?

03:37.967 --> 03:39.302
I don't know.

03:39.385 --> 03:40.887
He's just gonna eat rocks.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.639
Oh, he pooped. He did.

03:43.431 --> 03:45.433
How do you feel about the fake wedding?

03:45.934 --> 03:46.768
It's great.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.437
-It's great.
-You don't look like it's great.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.481
I just wish it was real. That's all.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.234
It's just my little kid dreams.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.778
Alex having a fake wedding
makes me feel a little hurt,

03:56.861 --> 03:58.821
because it's something that I really want,

03:58.905 --> 04:01.032
and to, like,
fake it is a little messed up.

04:01.115 --> 04:05.119
I definitely don't think he realizes
that it might be toying with my emotions,

04:05.203 --> 04:09.499
'cause he doesn't really think like that,
he just thinks, "Okay. Bit. This is bit."

04:09.582 --> 04:10.500
And that is it.

04:11.542 --> 04:13.920
Does it ever worry you
that he acts like that?

04:14.003 --> 04:15.338
Yeah, kind of.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.966
Like, he clicked-baited
proposing to you, right?

04:18.049 --> 04:19.342
Uh, yeah.

04:19.425 --> 04:22.512
And this is not the first time
he's done something like this.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.597


04:24.681 --> 04:26.516
I love you so much, baby.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.309
Will you…

04:28.393 --> 04:29.978
eat this Ring Pop?

04:30.061 --> 04:31.604
-
-I genuinely hate you.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.400
Definitely is a lot of pressure
on keeping up

04:35.483 --> 04:38.653
with what videos are gonna get
more views than others.

04:38.736 --> 04:41.072
And that's a little bit of a headache,

04:41.155 --> 04:45.201
because Alex always wants to up the stakes
to keep people entertained.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.454
And he knows
that all you want is to get married?

04:48.538 --> 04:50.373
-Yeah.
I would kind of be annoyed.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.250
-I love Alex. Nothing against him.
-Yeah.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.002
I also get it, 'cause it was a bit.

04:54.085 --> 04:56.462
-People don't have fake weddings.
-Weddings.

04:56.546 --> 04:57.797
It's all over the Internet.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.717
-I feel it's pushing it past the point…
-Mm-hmm.

05:01.342 --> 05:03.886
-…of what you should be doing now.
-I think so too.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.763
Almost three years into it, I'm just--

05:05.847 --> 05:06.931
Over it?

05:07.015 --> 05:07.890
Yeah.

05:08.766 --> 05:10.727
You know Kouvr is gonna be so mad.

05:10.810 --> 05:11.644
For what?

05:11.728 --> 05:14.731
She always wanted a real wedding.
You'll fake it to put it--

05:14.814 --> 05:18.609
-We'll get a real wedding eventually.
-Kouvr's not gonna let this go, Alex!

05:18.693 --> 05:20.778
-Yeah.
-I'm not sure how Kouvr feels.

05:20.862 --> 05:23.156
I haven't asked.
I think she's taking it seriously

05:23.239 --> 05:26.117
and buying a super nice dress
and getting makeup and hair done.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.870
It's definitely a different take
on how I'm viewing it,

05:28.953 --> 05:30.747
but as long as she's happy, I don't care.

05:32.123 --> 05:35.626
I'm too immature to be married.
I'm way too young.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.170
How old do you have to be?

05:37.253 --> 05:39.422
-He's saying he's not ready yet.
-Oh.

05:40.214 --> 05:42.675
He just didn't have, like, a childhood.

05:43.176 --> 05:46.971
And so he just, like,
is still in his childhood phase.

05:47.847 --> 05:52.643
I think I'm ready to take that step,
'cause I had to grow up really fast.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.771
Like, I didn't have a dad growing up.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.648
And I took care of my sisters a lot,
I had a single mom.

05:57.732 --> 05:58.775
You feel older.

05:58.858 --> 06:01.527
I definitely do.
Like, I feel like I've been through a lot.

06:01.611 --> 06:05.948
I just want to finally be like--
Feel safe, you know?

06:06.032 --> 06:06.866
Makes sense.

06:07.575 --> 06:10.536
I don't think Kouvr says everything
she needs to say all the time.

06:10.620 --> 06:14.457
I want her…
to stand up for herself a little more.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.460
But I think that,
because she's been left by people,

06:20.296 --> 06:22.423
Of course she'll wait for him,
and do whatever,

06:22.507 --> 06:24.509
but, like, I know she's sad right now.

06:25.009 --> 06:26.260
-Question!
-Yes?

06:26.344 --> 06:27.970
Are we having a bachelor party?

06:28.054 --> 06:29.138
-No.
-Yes!

06:30.223 --> 06:31.349
It's not a real wedding!

06:31.432 --> 06:33.142
-We have to--
-It's not real!

06:45.530 --> 06:46.781
The king is here.

06:46.864 --> 06:49.450
-Get your ass in here. Where you been?

06:49.534 --> 06:50.451
Hi, Grandma.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.121
It's almost your birthday.

06:55.331 --> 06:57.083


06:57.166 --> 06:59.961
This is why I should've stayed
my ass in Encino.

07:01.379 --> 07:04.757
I am from Compton,
South Central, California.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.592
"The Trenches" is what they call it.

07:06.676 --> 07:10.054
It's a blessing because I grew from a,
you know, grounded background,

07:10.138 --> 07:13.474
and I still feel like we should
all remember where we came from.

07:13.558 --> 07:16.102
-We got pictures.
-Don't show those pictures.

07:16.185 --> 07:17.812
What? You were so cute.

07:17.895 --> 07:20.606
Oh my, this is so em--
My forehead is so big. Hide it.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.984
No. We ain't doing
no forehead reveal today.

07:23.067 --> 07:25.820
-Where was this at? You remember?
-Whose car is that?

07:26.571 --> 07:28.156
Your uncle. My brother.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.741
Oh my God. Look at me in the closet.
That's so sad.

07:32.076 --> 07:33.786
I've been through hell and back.

07:33.870 --> 07:37.373
From when I was like, seven years old to,
like, 14 years old, my dad was in jail,

07:37.457 --> 07:41.210
and my mom, she wasn't too fond
about the gay lifestyle.

07:41.294 --> 07:45.131
She kicked me out eventually, when she,
like, accepted the fact that I was gay,

07:45.214 --> 07:46.716
she sent me with my dad

07:46.799 --> 07:49.510
thinking my dad would change me
into a straight male.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.637
And it left me
with a lot of trauma.

07:51.721 --> 07:54.515
That's why I'm funny.
I have a successful YouTube channel,

07:54.599 --> 07:57.393
'cause I have a lot of built-up trauma
from my father and mother.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.520
Stop posting embarrassing pictures of me.

07:59.604 --> 08:00.897
-Oh my God.

08:00.980 --> 08:04.066
My fans are literally making fun of me.
They're bullying me.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.740
But she always accepted me.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.743
-So I came here to call a family meeting.
-Okay.

08:13.826 --> 08:17.246
I just want you all to know
that you guys won't be on my will,

08:17.330 --> 08:19.332
and I'm taking all my money with me.

08:19.415 --> 08:21.667
You're cutting us out the will,
that's cool.

08:21.751 --> 08:24.170
-I have a policy for you and Jaden.

08:24.253 --> 08:25.379
What's your policy?

08:26.088 --> 08:28.674
I ain't telling you
'cause you might have me knocked off.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.929
-You better watch it!
-I can arrange that.

08:33.012 --> 08:36.766
On a serious note,
I love and appreciate you.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.101
Can you help me convince her
to get out of here?

08:39.185 --> 08:42.396
-Tried it. Sorry.
-I will pay for your apartment.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.524
I don't want no damn apartment.

08:44.607 --> 08:48.319
I already had this conversation.
So I'm just… I already tried it.

08:48.402 --> 08:51.322
You need to live for yourself.
Like, we love the 'hood.

08:51.405 --> 08:55.117
You're a humble girl, I get it, but, like,
it's time for her to live on her own.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.370
-She's not--
-This is not Compton.

08:58.412 --> 09:01.499
-This is, it says "Compton, California."
-This is Compton Avenue.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.084
-This is South Central.
-Compton.

09:03.167 --> 09:04.460
No.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.461
Nope.

09:05.545 --> 09:09.173
Since you're on the subject,
you wrote a letter when you were young.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.259
-Do you still have that?
-What did it say?

09:11.342 --> 09:13.761
It said that when I become a rock star,

09:13.844 --> 09:17.682
I'm going to buy my grandma a house,
because my grandma accepts me.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.725
And I was 12 when I wrote that.

09:19.809 --> 09:23.271
And, you know, you really were
there for me and I really appreciate that.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.983
Family's super important.
It just keeps me grounded.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.986
And there's no place like home,
you know what I mean?

09:30.069 --> 09:31.904
Other people forget where they came from.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.909
or how much money you have.

09:36.993 --> 09:40.246
I know where I'm from, bitch.
I ain't never gonna change.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.873
Who's The Temptations? Oh my God.

09:42.957 --> 09:46.085
-"Who's the Temptations?"
-This is an eight-track. You don't know.

09:46.168 --> 09:47.044
What's that?

09:47.128 --> 09:50.214
-You don't know the Temptations?
-I know Ariana Grande.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.925
Did y'all have Apple Music,
Spotify back in the day?

09:53.009 --> 09:55.011
No. This is what we had. See?

09:55.094 --> 09:56.762
-Ooh.
-If by that--

09:56.846 --> 09:59.181
-Is that like a Nintendo 64 game?
-And then--

10:09.900 --> 10:11.277
Patty, that looks so wrong!

10:11.360 --> 10:13.112
-Thomas!
-Oh my God.

10:27.293 --> 10:30.671
Can we just talk about Jake
and his forehead right now?

10:32.882 --> 10:34.717
That moth has been
on his head an hour.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.928
I know. I've tried to hit it
with the pool stick. He won't let me.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.847
Hey,
look who decided to join us.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.807
-What do you mean by that?
-Oh, hello.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.392
You're just never around.

10:45.853 --> 10:46.937
Yeah.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.899
Vinnie's been… He just doesn't do much.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.525
He likes to sit in his room.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.945
It's something where I'm like,
"Vinnie, what are you doing to help out?"

10:55.029 --> 10:57.073
Like, he doesn't like making content.

10:57.156 --> 10:58.491
You're never around.

10:58.574 --> 11:02.662
Why couldn't you just come into my room
or come to me when I'm out in the kitchen

11:02.745 --> 11:05.164
and then say it to my face
instead of during dinner,

11:05.247 --> 11:07.083
-when I'm not there?
-You don't talk.

11:07.166 --> 11:10.002
-I don't talk? I'm talking right now.
-You're always upset.

11:10.711 --> 11:14.340
I am pissed. Absolutely beyond.
No, beyond pissed.

11:14.423 --> 11:15.383
What's wrong?

11:15.466 --> 11:17.301
I just hate everything, and everybody.

11:17.385 --> 11:20.888
Living in a content house,
it can get overwhelming at some points,

11:20.971 --> 11:22.932
because you wanna be alone sometimes,

11:23.015 --> 11:26.894
but also I went
from making just TikTok content,

11:26.977 --> 11:30.940
and maybe streaming for an hour,
to posting every day,

11:31.023 --> 11:33.526
streaming for four to five hours a day.

11:33.609 --> 11:37.988
Making content for TikTok, and Instagram,
and Twitter, and YouTube, and Twitch.

11:38.072 --> 11:41.492
Modeling, photo shoots.
And it takes a toll on you.

11:42.201 --> 11:45.287
The first month you were here,
I filmed maybe six videos with you,

11:45.371 --> 11:48.457
and then I didn't ask you again,
'cause you have the worst attitude.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.502
Your energy is so off,
and it seems like you don't wanna be here.

11:51.585 --> 11:56.132
Why would I share what I'm feeling
to somebody that has that attitude?

11:56.215 --> 11:59.009
We're all here to make content.
That's why we live here.

12:00.720 --> 12:04.348
Okay, I bring in a different audience
because of what I do,

12:04.432 --> 12:07.810
and what I do half the time is I stream,
I make money off of that,

12:07.893 --> 12:09.061
and I can't make TikTok--

12:11.439 --> 12:14.692
I can't make a thirst trap with Thomas.
It would be just awkward.

12:14.775 --> 12:17.862
I do, at times,
wish that I could just stream

12:17.945 --> 12:20.322
and just not have
to worry about anything else.

12:20.406 --> 12:23.659
Him saying, "You're not getting
stuff done. You need to do content."

12:23.743 --> 12:27.288
Coming from him, especially, it's like…
It makes me not want to do it at all.

12:27.371 --> 12:29.790
The whole reason
this brand exists and succeeded

12:29.874 --> 12:31.751
is 'cause it was built on
individual creators

12:31.834 --> 12:33.377
that came together as a group.

12:33.461 --> 12:36.922
Vinnie was already established,
which is why bringing him in helps him,

12:37.006 --> 12:39.967
'cause he gets our audience,
but he also brings in his audience,

12:40.050 --> 12:42.803
where you came from Hype House.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.805
But you're both right, in a sense.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.433
You're right, because you
just have to do your own work

12:47.516 --> 12:49.518
get stuff done,
and you have a stressful life.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.604
You're right,
we all need to work together more,

12:51.687 --> 12:54.648
we all need to film together more,
and that's equal on everyone.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.359
-That's everyone.
-Every person in this house.

12:57.443 --> 13:01.989
It's just a different perspective for me
'cause I worked my ass off to get here.

13:02.072 --> 13:04.950
And as soon as you get here,
you worked for a week, like, happy,

13:05.034 --> 13:06.744
and then, like, on your own.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.473
-

13:30.476 --> 13:32.269
<i>-What?</i>
-Hm…

13:32.353 --> 13:33.646
Do you think I changed?

13:34.230 --> 13:35.064
<i>Like, why?</i>

13:35.773 --> 13:36.690
Come in my room.

13:41.529 --> 13:42.863
What'd you change?

13:42.947 --> 13:45.491
Bitch, why are you wearing
sunglasses in the house

13:45.574 --> 13:47.576
and a robe at 7:22?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.912
I know somewhere around here
there's a camera,

13:49.995 --> 13:52.706
-and I just don't wanna be seen.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.875
Ravon is my best friend
that lives with me,

13:54.959 --> 13:58.003
but the way we met was
he was a fan of me, in fact.

13:58.504 --> 14:01.924
And he made a video where he did this,
like, Carpool Karaoke with me,

14:02.007 --> 14:04.844
he had a cardboard cutout of me,
and it was the funniest thing.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.054
I just wanna say thank you
for coming on my chan--

14:07.137 --> 14:09.348
-Look at him. He's nervous. Oh my God.
-Ooh.

14:10.307 --> 14:13.894
I was like, "You should move to L.A."
He was like, "It's hard to afford it."

14:13.978 --> 14:16.397
I was like, "I like you a lot, live here."

14:16.480 --> 14:18.607
Only person I know who wears a robe.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.776
How do you spell "robe"? R-O-B, right?

14:20.860 --> 14:21.902
-Oh, E.
-R-- What?

14:21.986 --> 14:23.153
That's "robbed."

14:23.237 --> 14:25.197
R-O-B-E. What, you posted that?

14:25.281 --> 14:26.156
Yeah, I did.

14:26.740 --> 14:30.077
So I called your ass in here
because a bitch needs advice.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.412
You saw the Anna Oop video,

14:31.495 --> 14:34.748
where they basically said,
"Larray's career is over in seconds."

14:34.832 --> 14:36.876
This video came out recently about me,

14:36.959 --> 14:40.087
saying I ended my career
because I became friends with some people.

14:40.170 --> 14:43.090
<i> Witness the Downfall</i>
<i>of Larray's Career.</i>

14:43.173 --> 14:46.260
<i>Larray did meet</i>
<i>many new friends once he moved to L.A.</i>

14:46.343 --> 14:49.805
<i>And, surprisingly,</i>
<i>things went downhill from that moment.</i>

14:49.889 --> 14:52.933
<i>Larray started to officially</i>
<i>become a member of the Hype House</i>

14:53.017 --> 14:54.768
<i>just to gain more followers and views.</i>

14:54.852 --> 14:58.439
<i>Some of his OG fan started</i>
<i>accusing Larray of being whitewashed.</i>

14:58.522 --> 15:02.109
<i>You think his personality changed</i>
<i>after hanging out with Nikita</i> <i>Dragun?</i>

15:02.192 --> 15:03.402
<i>Dragun? Dragun?</i>

15:04.194 --> 15:05.779
-That was dramatic.
-So dramatic.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.406
It was good clickbait. I clicked.

15:07.489 --> 15:08.824
-Me too.
-I said, "He's over?"

15:08.908 --> 15:11.994
"Wait, my roommate?"
There may be something in those views.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.666
This YouTube video,
it made me realize, like, "Okay."

15:17.750 --> 15:20.502
Right now I'm canceled by association.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.505
-Did you just make that up?
-Lowkey big brain energy.

15:23.589 --> 15:28.344
My entire race, basically,
the Black community, has disowned me,

15:28.427 --> 15:30.971
which sucks,
because I'm so passionate about it.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.265
I don't want people that been here for me

15:33.349 --> 15:35.517
and, people who support me,
got me where I am today,

15:35.601 --> 15:36.602
feel some type of way,

15:36.685 --> 15:40.773
but I got into a situation where
I associated with problematic people.

15:40.856 --> 15:44.818
The situation that's really
shifting me is because…

15:44.902 --> 15:46.654
Nikita, right?

15:46.737 --> 15:49.740
Everyone says, on the Internet,
that she blackfishes and all that stuff.

15:49.823 --> 15:53.535
The Black community is very upset with me
because I associate with her.

15:53.619 --> 15:56.246
Nikita has been accused
of blackfishing multiple times.

15:56.330 --> 15:59.500
Blackfishing is
a person who is appropriating

15:59.583 --> 16:02.670
having a darker skin tone
or wearing African beads

16:02.753 --> 16:06.757
or doing a hairstyle with braids
or just, honestly, anything

16:07.341 --> 16:10.678
towards the African American community
if you're not Black.

16:10.761 --> 16:13.639
It's very offensive,
and it's kind of ignorant.

16:13.722 --> 16:16.809
When I met her, that was
the first-ever influencer that I met

16:16.892 --> 16:18.686
that was genuinely sweet to me,

16:18.769 --> 16:21.897
and I got so close with her,
and then people want me to drop her.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.317
But then she, like…
Like, it's also, like, one of…

16:25.401 --> 16:27.945
-A girl that's been there for me.
-She's your friend.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.990
I don't know what to do,
I'm not gonna sit here and let

16:31.073 --> 16:35.160
my community, which I would die for,
sit here and think I'm this tarnation.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.412
When you meet new people,

16:36.495 --> 16:39.373
there's a personal side to them
and there's the reputation side.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.542
-Yeah.
-People don't know both.

16:41.625 --> 16:42.501
That's true.

16:42.584 --> 16:45.337
Unlike Nikita,
I handle my problems like an adult.

16:45.421 --> 16:49.133
I'm not gonna ghost her. I love her,
but I can't let her feel like it's okay.

16:49.216 --> 16:51.427
If she doesn't feel
like she's doing wrong,

16:51.510 --> 16:52.845
it's still hurting people,

16:52.928 --> 16:55.973
and it's just ignorant to act
like their feelings don't matter.

16:56.056 --> 16:59.143
You know I'm not a deaf-tone person,
you know this.

17:02.896 --> 17:05.065
and I will try to make change,
that's just me.

17:05.149 --> 17:07.693
That's my morals,
but how do you bring that up?

17:07.776 --> 17:09.737
Like, "Hey! You're looking a little…"

17:09.820 --> 17:11.196
Like, what do I say?

17:11.280 --> 17:12.197
Just tell her.

17:12.281 --> 17:16.118
Just be like, "Nikita, baby, this photo."

17:16.201 --> 17:17.578
"I have a lot of questions."

17:19.371 --> 17:20.748
I'm not gonna lie to you.

17:24.376 --> 17:27.379
I'm about to fart, because it's scary

17:27.463 --> 17:29.089
and I don't know what she'll do.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.466
I'm like, "Hey, babe."

17:30.549 --> 17:33.260
"You're so pretty without a tan.
Let's keep it that way."

17:36.680 --> 17:39.016


17:39.099 --> 17:41.602


17:42.102 --> 17:43.270
Such a big day today.

17:43.353 --> 17:46.523
-Stop saying that.
-It's a huge day.

17:47.608 --> 17:50.611
I don't know
how weddings traditionally work,

17:50.694 --> 17:52.780
but you guys feel free to add an improv.

17:52.863 --> 17:55.157
But a lot of it's already planned out.

17:56.283 --> 17:57.409
My pants don't fit.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.954
-Look it, perfect size.
-Paper. What size is this?

18:01.038 --> 18:02.706
They're really big. They're 40s.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.751
I can't fit--
That's too big. I need, like, 36.

18:07.544 --> 18:08.754
What are you wearing?

18:08.837 --> 18:10.255
-What?
-I like them.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.924
I keep stepping on the dress.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.592
Did you grab me sweatpants?

18:13.675 --> 18:15.844
You said, "Grab any pair of black pants."

18:15.928 --> 18:18.388
I have no pockets.
All my stuff's in my underwear.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.141
I feel like socks with these
is just not okay.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.436
I'm not going in the water,
I'm going to a wedding.

18:33.195 --> 18:36.865
You're getting married!
All in favor of it being real say "Aye!"

18:36.949 --> 18:38.117
Aye!

18:44.706 --> 18:46.583
-Sheesh.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.168


18:48.252 --> 18:49.670
-

18:49.753 --> 18:51.380


18:53.799 --> 18:54.675
Oh God.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.302
Oh God.

18:57.386 --> 18:58.345
'Sup, Vinnie.

18:58.428 --> 18:59.304
What's up?

18:59.388 --> 19:00.389
How you doing?

19:00.472 --> 19:02.141
-Good. How are you?
-Pretty good.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.811
-Came to work out, or what?
-Get some gains in.

19:06.603 --> 19:09.773
-Just wanted to see how you been doing.
-I been good, man.

19:11.733 --> 19:14.778
What about living here?
Any cons about living here?

19:14.862 --> 19:16.947
- Michael?

19:17.030 --> 19:20.409
Michael's one of them.
God, I wanna punch him in the face.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.578
I try not to be
too overbearing with Vinnie

19:22.661 --> 19:25.414
because I know how it feels
to be in his position

19:25.497 --> 19:27.583
when you are the hot thing at the time.

19:27.666 --> 19:31.336
It can start to feel
like everyone is using you.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.173
I think that Vinnie is gonna
be a huge part of Hype House,

19:34.256 --> 19:37.968
so I want him to be more invested,
and him to want to do the things with us.

19:38.051 --> 19:39.720
I want him to want to participate.

19:39.803 --> 19:41.180
Sometimes I forget, too,

19:41.263 --> 19:43.765
you're in the first stage
of blowing up on social media.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.559
-It's like a test.
-Yeah.

19:45.642 --> 19:47.311
Right when you hit that point,

19:47.394 --> 19:50.147
everyone comes after you
to try to tear you down,

19:50.230 --> 19:51.773
because that's just how it is.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.984
Yeah, people that don't have
the bigger picture yet.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.944
-It's messed up.

19:59.573 --> 20:00.449
I hate you.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.287
When do you start training? Next week?

20:05.370 --> 20:07.706
I have to train for the fight,
the boxing match.

20:07.789 --> 20:09.082
That's in May.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.752
TikTokkers versus YouTubers
is a boxing match coming up.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.629
This is a good example of how

20:13.712 --> 20:16.715
an amazing opportunity comes
to someone who is part of Hype House.

20:16.798 --> 20:19.384
I got reached out to
about fighting this kid, Deji,

20:19.468 --> 20:21.929
but I figured
that Vinnie should take that fight,

20:22.012 --> 20:24.556
and it'd be a great way
for him to get a new audience

20:24.640 --> 20:27.309
and a good clout opportunity for him
if it's done right.

20:27.893 --> 20:31.104
I consider Hype House
like a Nickelodeon or like a Disney.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.732
-Mm-hmm.
-If someone was on Nickelodeon,

20:33.815 --> 20:36.902
that was their chance
to hit a young audience,

20:36.985 --> 20:40.489
and they could turn it into something,
look at Ariana Grande.

20:40.572 --> 20:41.990
-Yeah.
- Or Victoria Justice.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.034
Selena Gomez, look how far they came.

20:44.117 --> 20:47.246
I want people that are gonna turn this
into something and go far.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.664
-Yeah.
-But just have fun.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.499
-Yeah.
-It's the point of this.

20:50.582 --> 20:53.043
I'm very appreciative of Thomas.

20:53.126 --> 20:55.879
He takes care of me,
he treats me like his younger brother,

20:55.963 --> 20:57.464
which is something that I needed.

20:57.547 --> 21:00.467
That's one reason
I try to fit in with Hype House,

21:00.550 --> 21:03.720
but also, just because I was given
this opportunity by everybody else.

21:03.804 --> 21:07.933
Like, if everybody else hated me,
it wouldn't be the same.

21:08.016 --> 21:12.688
So I wanna be able to get along
with everybody and appreciate them.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.648
-All right, appreciate it.
-Of course.

21:14.731 --> 21:17.442
And, trust me, you're gonna
wanna get a lock on your door.

21:27.536 --> 21:29.913
Ding-dong! I'm here, bitches!

21:32.791 --> 21:34.251
Why did I get a boner?

21:34.835 --> 21:38.297
I got one too.
I got one, too, for you too.

21:38.380 --> 21:42.926
I have been waiting
to be the flower girl my entire life.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.637
-Okay. Are we going or what?
-Hell, yeah! High-five!

21:45.721 --> 21:48.181
Is it time?
They only hired me for six hours.

21:50.183 --> 21:51.101
My God.

21:51.184 --> 21:53.312
This fake wedding thing
is breaking my heart,

21:53.395 --> 21:59.985
because I just know somewhere deep inside
that gorgeous human being that is Kouvr,

22:00.861 --> 22:02.362
she really wants this wedding.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.239
And I think it's cruel, to be honest.

22:04.323 --> 22:07.034
But at the same time, like,
I guess anything for views.

22:07.909 --> 22:10.746
But damn,
I know she wants that ring, bitch.

22:11.913 --> 22:13.874
Come on. Everyone!
To the wedding!

22:17.919 --> 22:20.797
I definitely don't feel super comfortable,

22:20.881 --> 22:24.426
just because I know it's fake,
but I want it to be real so badly.

22:24.509 --> 22:27.429
And so it kind of
makes my stomach turn a little bit.

22:27.512 --> 22:30.349
It just hurts,
but I'm gonna do it anyways.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.184
It seems like it's fun.

22:32.267 --> 22:35.103
And so I'm just gonna
push through it.

22:35.187 --> 22:38.607
You guys! Attention, Caucasians!

22:38.690 --> 22:40.442
We are going to be starting.

22:54.289 --> 22:57.417
Hi, my name is Paper Connor Yates,
and I am the "offician-ashing."

22:57.501 --> 22:58.794
-"Officianator."
-Offician--

22:58.877 --> 23:00.796
-Offician--
-Officiator.

23:00.879 --> 23:02.547
-Oh my God.
-Officiator.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.841
We are gathered here today… tonight.

23:05.884 --> 23:10.972
…to join this man and this woman
in lov… lovely "mansionary."

23:11.056 --> 23:12.933
-"Matrimony."
-Matrimony.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.685
Some of the groomsmen wrote speeches.

23:15.769 --> 23:19.689
If you have, now is the time for--
Speech your speech.

23:19.773 --> 23:22.275
-I don't have pockets.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.403
As soon as I entered
the home of Hype House,

23:24.486 --> 23:27.989
I found a family that cares…
about watching me get hurt.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.449
-Thank you.

23:29.533 --> 23:30.867
Nice!

23:30.951 --> 23:32.994
It's going exactly
how I expected it to go.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.125
I mean,
this is absolutely fantastic content.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.293
Alex David Dobrik Warren Hughes.

23:40.377 --> 23:45.382
Do you take this woman to be your wife
for as long as you both shall live?

23:47.050 --> 23:48.093
I do.

23:48.677 --> 23:51.096
-Wrong answer.

23:51.680 --> 23:55.976
Kouvr Ukulele
Pineapple Juice Coconut Milk Annon,

23:56.059 --> 24:00.272
do you take this hunk of beautiful meat
to be your husband?

24:00.897 --> 24:03.442
-I do.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.610
-Oh, yeah! That's the man!
-Michael!

24:06.945 --> 24:09.698
All right.
We're back in my speech.

24:09.781 --> 24:10.991
Please join hands.

24:11.074 --> 24:15.495
By virtue of the authority vested to me
by Americanmarriageministries.com,

24:15.579 --> 24:17.581
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

24:18.874 --> 24:22.127
-You may-- You may kiss the bride?
-Oh, wait. You may kiss the bride.

24:34.848 --> 24:36.808
And you can minister your own wedding!

24:36.892 --> 24:38.643
-Thank you.

24:39.269 --> 24:42.189
I definitely couldn't
imagine my life without Alex.

24:42.272 --> 24:44.774
He's the person
that I want to spend my life with.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.526
-Is the lighting okay?
-Yeah.

24:46.610 --> 24:47.486
One more.

24:47.569 --> 24:51.656
But I want to stop
doing bits that blur the line

24:51.740 --> 24:54.993
between social media and the relationship,

24:55.076 --> 24:58.163
'cause it kind of
messes with my head a little bit.

24:58.246 --> 25:00.540
Turn this way, everybody.
Quick for a pic. Ready?

25:00.624 --> 25:03.084
-Alex is married!
-Three, two, one! Boom.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.517
-Hey.
-Hello.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.936
-Did you enjoy yourself?
-Mm-hmm.

25:21.019 --> 25:22.062
Are you sure?

25:22.145 --> 25:24.731
Yeah, it was very real, you know?

25:24.814 --> 25:26.525
I feel like you hated it.

25:26.608 --> 25:30.654
I didn't hate it. I mean,
I wanna get married one of these days.

25:30.737 --> 25:32.989
-"One of these days"?
-One of these days.

25:34.741 --> 25:37.619
-You know it's only what you want.
-No, it's not.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.581
Like how long
would you really make me wait?

25:43.458 --> 25:46.169
I don't want to give you a false timeline.

25:46.670 --> 25:49.297
I don't wanna wait,
like, four or five years.

25:50.298 --> 25:54.135
He thinks that it's all his decision
because I'm ready and he's not.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.887
And so it's whenever he's ready.

25:55.971 --> 25:57.472
But I wanna be happy too.

25:58.473 --> 25:59.933
So, what do you want?

26:00.016 --> 26:03.019
To get married to you
in a reasonable time.

26:03.103 --> 26:05.146
-Okay, you know what I want?
-What?

26:05.230 --> 26:08.024
Is to not worry about that
at the age of 20.

26:08.108 --> 26:09.568
Being a husband and a father,

26:09.651 --> 26:12.112
I've learned from my dad,
is a full-time job.

26:12.195 --> 26:14.406
The issue that I keep battling in my head

26:14.489 --> 26:17.993
is I'm in a full-time job right now,
and I'm in a full-time commitment

26:18.076 --> 26:21.288
of trying to make people laugh
and make people feel a certain way,

26:21.371 --> 26:25.458
and I'm not done, you know,
doing pranks and doing stunts.

26:25.542 --> 26:28.128
I don't wanna be part-time
in my marriage when I have it.

26:28.211 --> 26:29.212
I wanna be fully in.

26:29.296 --> 26:31.631
We've been dating
for almost three years and--

26:31.715 --> 26:35.385
What, we've been dating for two years,
seven months of that was long-distance.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.474
You know? And we've had our rocks--
Rocky back and forths.

26:42.684 --> 26:46.563
I just don't wanna jump
into something so serious in life yet.

26:46.646 --> 26:49.065
I'm not rushing anything.
I just wanna know.

26:49.149 --> 26:51.151
I don't have an answer for you.

27:08.043 --> 27:08.877
Hello?

27:10.629 --> 27:12.464
-Hello?
-<i>Hola</i>.

27:12.547 --> 27:14.174
-Hello?
-Hi.

27:14.257 --> 27:15.425
Hello?

27:15.508 --> 27:16.676
Like, <i>¿cómo estás</i>?

27:16.760 --> 27:18.762
<i>-Bien, bien, ¿y tú?</i>
-Like, <i>sí</i>.

27:18.845 --> 27:19.763
Hey, girl.

27:21.139 --> 27:22.265
Are you editing?

27:22.349 --> 27:24.726
This shirt's giving very much… giving.

27:24.809 --> 27:25.935
-Giving what?
-Titties.

27:26.019 --> 27:27.020
Is it?

27:27.103 --> 27:28.938
It's so weird, 'cause, like, bitch…

27:29.022 --> 27:29.856
What?

27:29.939 --> 27:32.400
…the doctors, you,
your mama did a great job.

27:32.484 --> 27:33.860
You're a pretty bitch.

27:33.943 --> 27:35.403
-Thank you.
-Pretty-ass bitch.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.697
Pretty and problematic.
Write it on my tombstone.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.532
Speaking of problematic!

27:40.241 --> 27:42.160
-What?
-Weird that you say that.

27:42.994 --> 27:45.372
I need a chair, because…

27:46.748 --> 27:48.541
my knees are feeling a little weak.

27:48.625 --> 27:49.959
Is this what therapy is like?

27:50.043 --> 27:51.711
-I've never had therapy.
-I think so.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.088
Intervention vibes, huh?

27:53.171 --> 27:54.172
-Very much.
-Very much.

27:54.255 --> 27:55.715
Is it for me or for you?

27:55.799 --> 27:59.010
There's so much tension, uh…
This just is, like, so weird.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.012
I thought we were here to kumbaya.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.014
Okay. So look…

28:03.598 --> 28:05.350
You're my girl. Right?

28:08.436 --> 28:11.147
I just don't think I can, like…

28:11.231 --> 28:14.693
sit back and just let the Black community
and just everyone on the Internet

28:14.776 --> 28:17.946
say, "Oh, how are you friends
with this person when she blackfishes?"

28:18.029 --> 28:20.573
I see you in person almost all the time.

28:20.657 --> 28:22.784
You don't look like those pictures.

28:22.867 --> 28:26.413
Sometimes people be trolling,
sometimes it is the lighting, the filter.

28:26.996 --> 28:28.373
People are offended by it.

28:28.456 --> 28:31.626
You probably don't feel like
you're in the wrong, but you…

28:31.710 --> 28:33.211
come off as ignorant.

28:33.294 --> 28:36.631
They're just so pissed at me
and hate that I'm friends with people

28:36.715 --> 28:38.591
they think are "problematic."

28:38.675 --> 28:42.053
People do have feelings, and I feel
like I'm validating their feelings,

28:42.137 --> 28:45.306
because I'm just, like,
not speaking up about it,

28:45.390 --> 28:48.351
especially on serious accusations
like this.

28:48.435 --> 28:51.354
This is one thing that like--
I can't defend you on this one.

28:55.942 --> 28:57.110
I don't want to lose her,

28:57.193 --> 29:02.031
but it's either you fix it
or chuck the deuces.

29:02.115 --> 29:02.949
I'm out.
