WEBVTT

00:06.587 --> 00:07.798
Hey, hon,
it looks like

00:07.798 --> 00:09.720
someone finally
bought the Anderson house.

00:09.720 --> 00:11.802
Well, I hope the new neighbors
are a lot nicer.

00:11.802 --> 00:13.434
Did you know
the Andersons demanded

00:13.434 --> 00:15.186
I give them
my casserole dish?

00:15.186 --> 00:16.187
You mean the one
they loaned you

00:16.187 --> 00:17.558
and you never returned?

00:17.558 --> 00:20.191
I'm sorry, I did not realize
I was talking to an Anderson!

00:21.812 --> 00:24.815
Can I have $10
to buy diamonds?

00:24.815 --> 00:27.068
Where are you getting
diamonds for $10?

00:27.068 --> 00:28.569
Probably the same place
where your dad bought

00:28.569 --> 00:30.030
my engagement ring.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.952
Which I wouldn't
trade for anything.

00:31.952 --> 00:34.915
They shove a lot of love
into that tiny stone.

00:37.078 --> 00:39.460
I'm not asking
for real diamonds.

00:39.460 --> 00:41.041
It's so I can level up
in the Diamond Kingdom

00:41.041 --> 00:42.543
game on your tablet.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.505
Well, honey, just enjoy
the free Diamond Kingdom levels

00:44.505 --> 00:45.716
like your father and I do.

00:45.716 --> 00:47.798
But I've already beaten
all those levels.

00:47.798 --> 00:48.799
How did you do it?

00:48.799 --> 00:49.800
Every time
I get to the drawbridge

00:49.800 --> 00:50.971
on the first level,

00:50.971 --> 00:53.094
the Hypno-Troll puts
my wizard into a trance.

00:53.094 --> 00:55.976
He gets swirly eyes.

00:55.976 --> 00:58.729
You can't beat
the Hypno-Troll?

00:58.729 --> 01:00.391
Oh, mommy.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.564
Good morning, Tyler.

01:03.564 --> 01:04.735
Here, grab a plate.
I'll get you some breakfast.

01:04.735 --> 01:06.527
Don't have time.
Egg on hand.

01:09.110 --> 01:10.651
Well, it's better than
when he did it

01:10.651 --> 01:12.113
with the hot soup.

01:13.154 --> 01:15.576
Since I've been taking
accelerated classes

01:15.576 --> 01:17.698
to graduate early
and join the BMX circuit,

01:17.698 --> 01:18.999
I don't have time
for anything else.

01:18.999 --> 01:21.001
I barely have time
for the one thing

01:21.001 --> 01:22.793
that matters
most in the world.

01:22.793 --> 01:23.914
BOTH: Your hair.

01:23.914 --> 01:25.466
Didn't I just say that?

01:27.047 --> 01:29.590
You have to take care
of your hair.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.971
It helps people.

01:30.971 --> 01:33.053
Like that girl
who almost fell into a manhole

01:33.053 --> 01:34.135
but saw your hair
and stopped.

01:34.135 --> 01:35.676
I know.

01:35.676 --> 01:38.479
My hair got to meet
the mayor.

01:38.479 --> 01:41.522
But now I don't even
have time to comb it.

01:41.522 --> 01:43.184
I wish I had someone
to take care of all the things

01:43.184 --> 01:44.064
I don't have time for.

01:44.064 --> 01:45.986
Give me a job helping you.

01:45.986 --> 01:47.898
I need the money
to buy diamonds.

01:47.898 --> 01:49.860
Chloe, the only place
you can afford diamonds

01:49.860 --> 01:51.862
is where dad bought
mom's engagement ring.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.155
And the mall
shut down that kiosk.

01:54.155 --> 01:55.616
It didn't shut down.

01:55.616 --> 01:58.699
They're just selling
seasonal sausage right now.

01:58.699 --> 02:01.542
No, I mean diamonds
for my game.

02:01.542 --> 02:03.954
In that case,
I'll consider hiring you,

02:03.954 --> 02:06.207
but first I need to make sure
you have what it takes.

02:06.207 --> 02:07.798
Let's say
I'm late for school

02:07.798 --> 02:09.920
and I only have 10 seconds
to get dressed.

02:09.920 --> 02:11.131
Which shirt do you choose?

02:11.131 --> 02:12.843
Trick question.
You look great in everything.

02:12.843 --> 02:13.964
And?

02:13.964 --> 02:14.965
You don't care
if you're late for school.

02:14.965 --> 02:17.017
And?
No one else wants the job.

02:17.017 --> 02:18.969
Perfect.
You're hired.

02:18.969 --> 02:19.970
Now go grab me a shirt.

02:19.970 --> 02:21.101
You got it, boss.

02:21.101 --> 02:25.065
Not bad, but try saying it
like a New Jersey tough guy.

02:25.065 --> 02:26.146
You got it, boss.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.228
This is gonna work.

02:30.070 --> 02:32.072
STAN: It looks like
Tyler and Chloe are too busy

02:32.072 --> 02:33.574
to welcome
the new neighbors,

02:33.574 --> 02:35.656
so I guess it's up to me.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.198
I'm gonna go leave
a little present for them

02:37.198 --> 02:38.779
on their front lawn.

02:40.701 --> 02:41.992
Now if you'll excuse me,

02:41.992 --> 02:44.044
I have to eat this
elegant fruit basket

02:44.044 --> 02:46.957
and then go poop
on their front lawn.

03:07.308 --> 03:09.360
I know--

03:09.360 --> 03:10.981
What are you guys
all aflutter about?

03:10.981 --> 03:12.022
I don't flutter.

03:12.022 --> 03:14.275
I circle like a bird of prey.

03:17.238 --> 03:19.700
You know
that freaks me out!

03:21.242 --> 03:23.664
Anyway, we're talking
about the new girl Heather.

03:23.664 --> 03:25.085
Oh, yeah, my parents
said her family

03:25.085 --> 03:26.206
just moved
into the neighborhood,

03:26.206 --> 03:27.958
but I haven't had
the chance to meet her yet.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.750
I heard she's really stylish.

03:29.750 --> 03:30.961
I heard
she's really pretty.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.634
I heard she's really
a cyborg sent from the future.

03:33.634 --> 03:34.835
At least I hope so.

03:34.835 --> 03:37.137
A cyborg rampage is
just what this two-bit town

03:37.137 --> 03:39.009
needs to put it
on the map.

03:41.101 --> 03:42.973
Oh, hey,
that must be her.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.265
She's really stylish.

03:44.265 --> 03:46.016
She's really pretty.

03:46.016 --> 03:48.188
She's really doing a good job
hiding her robotic exoskeleton

03:48.188 --> 03:50.150
under a layer
of human-like skin.

03:50.150 --> 03:51.852
Well played, cyborg.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.025
We'd better enlist her
into our little group

03:55.025 --> 03:56.697
before the chess club
reels her in,

03:56.697 --> 03:59.239
they're always
three moves ahead of us.

04:02.823 --> 04:04.365
Hi, I'm Avery.

04:04.365 --> 04:05.706
You must be Heather.

04:05.706 --> 04:06.997
Yes, I must,

04:06.997 --> 04:08.289
until I'm 18

04:08.289 --> 04:11.171
and can legally change
my name to "Leave Me Alone."

04:11.171 --> 04:14.044
Oh, that's fun.

04:14.044 --> 04:15.045
I'm Lindsay.

04:16.176 --> 04:17.177
And I'm Max.

04:17.177 --> 04:18.429
Big cyborg fan.

04:18.429 --> 04:19.880
If you want to
keep me as a pet

04:19.880 --> 04:23.143
after you guys take over,
I'm totally cool with that.

04:24.435 --> 04:27.267
So welcome to
West Pasadena High.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.149
We'd be happy
to show you around,

04:29.149 --> 04:30.981
introduce you
to my really cool brother.

04:30.981 --> 04:33.063
No time to meet anyone!

04:33.063 --> 04:35.316
Good riding, boss!

04:37.197 --> 04:39.400
I have no idea
who those people are.

04:39.400 --> 04:43.704
Look, I find it best
to be clear up front.

04:43.704 --> 04:45.205
We're not friends.

04:45.205 --> 04:47.708
We're not gonna be friends.

04:47.708 --> 04:50.080
If we are trapped
on a desert island together,

04:50.080 --> 04:51.001
I'd leave.

04:51.001 --> 04:52.002
Like this.

04:55.175 --> 04:57.297
She's not even
pretending to swim.

05:03.093 --> 05:05.095
They are still unloading
the moving van?

05:05.095 --> 05:07.057
How much stuff could
the new neighbors have?

05:07.057 --> 05:09.059
Is that a bagpipe
he's carrying

05:09.059 --> 05:11.101
or a cat in a sweater?

05:11.101 --> 05:12.353
I don't know.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.395
( yowling )

05:14.395 --> 05:16.066
I still don't know.

05:17.197 --> 05:18.359
Come on, what do you say
we go introduce ourselves?

05:18.359 --> 05:19.490
No, no, no, no.

05:19.490 --> 05:21.822
Ellen, think about
what happens every time

05:21.822 --> 05:23.904
we become friends
with our neighbors, huh?

05:23.904 --> 05:26.827
Eventually it goes bad
and then when they see us

05:26.827 --> 05:28.409
getting the mail
or mowing the lawn,

05:28.409 --> 05:30.120
we have to avoid them
by pretending

05:30.120 --> 05:32.082
we're going
through a personal crisis.

05:38.509 --> 05:39.960
All right,
all right.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.422
We'll stay away
from these new neighbors

05:41.422 --> 05:42.883
and there'll never be
any awkwardness.

05:42.883 --> 05:44.094
We'll avoid them completely.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.305
Like my cousins in Irvine.

05:45.305 --> 05:46.927
Yes.
Or my Aunt Tina.

05:46.927 --> 05:48.098
Or my mother's side
of the family.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.309
Or those guys
I used to play golf with.

05:49.309 --> 05:51.061
Or the three book clubs
I dropped out of.

05:51.061 --> 05:52.272
Okay, but this is
going to be hard.

05:52.272 --> 05:54.064
I know.
We're such friendly people.

05:54.064 --> 05:55.185
I know.

05:58.399 --> 05:59.480
Watch out, Mason.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.031
There's the Hypno-Troll.

06:01.031 --> 06:03.984
Use the gnome jelly
and turn yourself into a mirror.

06:03.984 --> 06:05.035
Yes!

06:05.035 --> 06:07.287
You made him
hypnotize himself!

06:07.287 --> 06:09.199
Of course.

06:09.199 --> 06:11.081
Gnome jelly.

06:13.043 --> 06:15.205
All right, Chloe, it's
time to get back to work.

06:15.205 --> 06:17.127
Sorry, Mason,
I have to go to work

06:17.127 --> 06:19.259
so I can make money to buy
diamonds for my video game.

06:19.259 --> 06:20.501
You have a job?

06:20.501 --> 06:23.003
You are a kid, right?

06:23.003 --> 06:25.506
Hey, you wouldn't
buy me the diamonds.

06:25.506 --> 06:28.849
Sisters got to do
for themselves.

06:28.849 --> 06:30.060
Okay.

06:30.060 --> 06:32.563
I have to go to the bathroom
and do for myself.

06:34.475 --> 06:35.686
Wait.

06:35.686 --> 06:36.977
Mason, that's not the way
to the bath--

06:36.977 --> 06:39.399
You love his
free spirit, Chloe.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.152
Don't try to control it.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.614
All right,
I'm gonna start studying

06:43.614 --> 06:46.116
so I need you to do the things
I don't have time for.

06:46.116 --> 06:48.158
Is one of them trimming
your long nose hairs?

06:48.158 --> 06:49.910
What?
I don't have long nose hairs.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.532
You should see it from
where I'm standing.

06:51.532 --> 06:54.294
It's like an octopus
coming down a chimney.

06:55.586 --> 06:57.247
Look, just go get me a snack.

06:57.247 --> 06:59.129
You got it, boss.
Chloe.

06:59.129 --> 07:00.170
You got it, boss!

07:00.170 --> 07:01.462
I love it.

07:03.213 --> 07:05.005
Okay, Tyler,
time to take me

07:05.005 --> 07:06.216
for my afternoon walk.

07:06.216 --> 07:07.968
I'm too busy studying
right now, Stan.

07:07.968 --> 07:09.049
It'll have to wait.

07:09.049 --> 07:11.311
I need my exercise, Tyler.

07:11.311 --> 07:13.353
It's not like
I can take a yoga class,

07:13.353 --> 07:16.056
since Rachel
jacked up the price!

07:17.688 --> 07:20.020
Wow, that's amazing.

07:20.020 --> 07:21.021
Here's the best part.

07:21.021 --> 07:22.613
Those breadsticks
are really fun

07:22.613 --> 07:25.195
to stick into your upper lip
and pretend you're a walrus.

07:25.195 --> 07:26.617
Way ahead of you.

07:27.988 --> 07:29.369
Now take Stan for a walk.

07:29.369 --> 07:30.951
You got it, boss.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.534
You're gonna be very happy
with your performance review.

07:36.076 --> 07:37.998
How did I get up here?

07:40.170 --> 07:42.382
Hold up.
Why are you working for Tyler?

07:42.382 --> 07:44.585
He's paying me to do things
he doesn't have time for.

07:44.585 --> 07:46.677
Oh, like trim his
nose hairs, I hope?

07:46.677 --> 07:50.010
It's like a mop dangling
from a gutter spout.

07:50.010 --> 07:51.261
Right?

07:51.261 --> 07:53.093
Or some spaghetti
being squeezed

07:53.093 --> 07:56.687
out of a drain
pi-uuhhhhh...

07:56.687 --> 08:00.270
What's a drain pi-uuhhhhh?

08:01.271 --> 08:04.364
No, Chloe,
over there, look.

08:08.368 --> 08:09.740
She is the most
amazing creature

08:09.740 --> 08:11.201
I've ever seen.

08:11.201 --> 08:13.073
Words can't describe
how beautiful she is.

08:13.073 --> 08:15.165
But these cartoon
sound effects can.

08:15.165 --> 08:16.957
( whistling, boing )

08:19.580 --> 08:21.121
Hello.

08:21.121 --> 08:22.212
I'm Stan.

08:22.212 --> 08:25.255
I like your puffy parts.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.587
Hey, she didn't leave.

08:26.587 --> 08:29.179
Usually that line
doesn't work so well.

08:29.179 --> 08:31.091
Her name is Princess.

08:31.091 --> 08:32.262
There's a phone number here.

08:32.262 --> 08:34.014
We should call her owners
to come get her.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.095
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:35.095 --> 08:36.516
She's not going anywhere.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.058
She's the love of my life.

08:38.058 --> 08:41.061
And stop petting her.
I saw her first.

08:41.061 --> 08:43.443
You can date her,
I can pet her.

08:43.443 --> 08:45.355
We can make this work.

08:51.111 --> 08:54.244
So were you
bred here in Pasadena?

08:55.455 --> 08:57.117
Ooh, big moment.

08:57.117 --> 08:58.248
The two most
important ladies

08:58.248 --> 08:59.710
in my life
are about to meet.

08:59.710 --> 09:02.502
Avery, Princess.

09:02.502 --> 09:04.504
Princess, Avery.

09:04.504 --> 09:06.006
Hello, Princess.

09:07.337 --> 09:08.719
Paw.

09:08.719 --> 09:09.760
Paw.

09:09.760 --> 09:11.471
She's not being rude.

09:11.471 --> 09:13.473
We just have to work on that.

09:13.473 --> 09:15.846
Well, she's beautiful, Stan.

09:15.846 --> 09:17.598
Oh, I hope you get
along with her owners

09:17.598 --> 09:20.560
'cause things are getting
pretty serious over here.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.103
You guys may be spending
a lot of time together.

09:23.103 --> 09:24.354
Now if you'll excuse me,

09:24.354 --> 09:26.737
it's time for me
to offer Princess dessert.

09:26.737 --> 09:30.320
A choice of squirrel,
creme brulee, or tiramisu.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.492
I hope she picks squirrel.

09:32.492 --> 09:34.695
I don't
have the other two.

09:36.406 --> 09:37.748
So who are her owners?

09:37.748 --> 09:39.159
Oh, Chloe called them.

09:39.159 --> 09:40.040
They're on their way over.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.122
I think they're
our new neighbors.

09:42.122 --> 09:43.583
New neighbors?

09:43.583 --> 09:44.755
( doorbell ringing )

09:44.755 --> 09:46.967
Don't be Heather,

09:46.967 --> 09:48.208
don't be Heather,

09:48.208 --> 09:51.051
don't be-- Heather!

09:51.051 --> 09:52.713
Where's my dog?

09:52.713 --> 09:54.975
How did I get out here?

10:02.142 --> 10:03.814
What's going on here?

10:05.225 --> 10:07.317
We found your dog wandering
the neighborhood.

10:07.317 --> 10:09.529
And you're pretending
they're on a date

10:09.529 --> 10:13.283
with an orange monkey
as the waiter?

10:13.283 --> 10:14.695
That is weird.

10:14.695 --> 10:16.116
No, not at all.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.698
We're pretending
the monkey is an actor

10:17.698 --> 10:21.201
who's just doing this
until he gets his big break.

10:21.201 --> 10:23.583
But I think our dogs
like each other.

10:23.583 --> 10:24.584
Isn't it sweet?

10:24.584 --> 10:25.836
It's gross.

10:25.836 --> 10:27.748
I don't want
my purebred show dog

10:27.748 --> 10:30.380
consorting with a common,
mangy mutt.

10:30.380 --> 10:31.922
I'll have you know

10:31.922 --> 10:34.214
I've been mangefree
since I switched shampoos.

10:34.214 --> 10:37.467
It's also
why I smell like papaya.

10:37.467 --> 10:40.140
Keep your mongrel away
from my Princess

10:40.140 --> 10:41.852
and stay out of my face!

10:41.852 --> 10:45.766
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe
I'll stay out of your face!

10:45.766 --> 10:48.228
That's right, I'm flustered.

10:52.032 --> 10:53.533
Avery, this is terrible.

10:53.533 --> 10:55.445
The love of my life is gone.

10:55.445 --> 10:57.327
I can't eat,
I can't sleep.

10:57.327 --> 10:58.699
It's only been
a couple seconds.

10:58.699 --> 10:59.990
And in those
couple seconds,

10:59.990 --> 11:01.241
have you seen me
eat or sleep?

11:13.714 --> 11:14.715
I got the mail.

11:16.346 --> 11:18.759
Did you fight
a bear for it?

11:18.759 --> 11:20.100
Worse.

11:20.100 --> 11:21.141
I was trying to stay away

11:21.141 --> 11:22.682
from the new neighbors
like we agreed,

11:22.682 --> 11:24.514
but they were outside
and almost saw me.

11:24.514 --> 11:27.067
So I jumped over a fence,
landed in a bush,

11:27.067 --> 11:29.149
and found out
where the raccoons sleep.

11:29.149 --> 11:30.981
And what they do
when a woman falls on them.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.404
Ooh, a dollar off
a car wash.

11:34.404 --> 11:35.525
I was waiting for that.

11:37.077 --> 11:39.449
Oh, look, trust me, Ellen.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.371
Keeping our distance
from the new neighbors

11:41.371 --> 11:43.163
is going to be
worth it in the long run.

11:43.163 --> 11:44.915
What are you doing?

11:44.915 --> 11:47.667
Oh, you can't just walk
around out there.

11:47.667 --> 11:49.379
What if the new neighbors
tried to talk to you?

11:49.379 --> 11:50.881
Did you practice
screaming at them

11:50.881 --> 11:52.132
in a nonsense language

11:52.132 --> 11:53.884
and running away like
we talked about?

11:53.884 --> 11:55.886
( blabbering )

12:00.891 --> 12:01.892
I don't have
time for this.

12:01.892 --> 12:03.974
( blabbering )

12:07.267 --> 12:08.268
You want some coffee?

12:08.268 --> 12:09.269
Yeah.

12:10.520 --> 12:12.312
Okay, Chloe,
I have to study,

12:12.312 --> 12:14.815
but I can't study
when my hair looks this bad.

12:14.815 --> 12:16.526
You know what
you have to do.

12:16.526 --> 12:17.527
Coming right up.

12:22.072 --> 12:23.123
I think I'll go

12:23.123 --> 12:25.325
with the number nine
long handle.

12:26.366 --> 12:27.828
Big Pete.

12:27.828 --> 12:29.169
Excellent choice, sir.

12:30.580 --> 12:32.712
Ow!
Twist and flutter!

12:32.712 --> 12:33.713
Twist and flutter!

12:33.713 --> 12:34.835
Did you learn nothing

12:34.835 --> 12:36.046
from the instructional
training videos

12:36.046 --> 12:37.177
you watched
when I hired you?

12:42.302 --> 12:44.554
Hello again.

12:44.554 --> 12:47.477
If you've made it this far,
you've learnt how to wash up

12:47.477 --> 12:50.350
and get ready
to touch Tyler's hair.

12:50.350 --> 12:52.102
Are you ready
for the big moment?

12:52.102 --> 12:53.103
Oh, Gladys.

12:57.197 --> 12:58.198
Thank you, Gladys.

13:00.070 --> 13:01.952
Thank you, Gladys.

13:01.952 --> 13:03.203
Mom, would you
please leave?

13:06.456 --> 13:08.208
So step one.

13:08.208 --> 13:09.209
How was I, honey?

13:11.171 --> 13:13.173
How did you have time
to make training videos

13:13.173 --> 13:15.005
and you don't have time
to comb your hair?

13:15.005 --> 13:16.506
I'm terrible at time
management.

13:16.506 --> 13:17.677
That's why I need
an assistant.

13:17.677 --> 13:19.469
Bored.

13:20.881 --> 13:22.883
Mason, I'm busy working.

13:22.883 --> 13:24.514
You're always working.

13:26.516 --> 13:28.808
I'm sorry, Tyler.
I have to talk to Mason.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.431
What's our policy
about private conversations

13:31.431 --> 13:32.482
on company time?

13:32.482 --> 13:33.563
I don't know.

13:33.563 --> 13:34.564
All the videos were about
your hair.

13:34.564 --> 13:35.565
Then I guess
you can talk to him.

13:38.528 --> 13:40.861
Mason, you can't
interrupt me at work.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.402
This job is important
to me.

13:42.402 --> 13:43.944
I miss playing with you.

13:43.944 --> 13:45.365
I miss playing
with you, too.

13:45.365 --> 13:47.707
But I just don't have time.

13:47.707 --> 13:49.870
I need an assistant
like Tyler has.

13:49.870 --> 13:52.212
I know.
I'll be your assistant.

13:55.956 --> 13:57.627
Bored.

13:57.627 --> 13:59.589
I miss playing with you.

13:59.589 --> 14:00.630
I'm sorry.

14:00.630 --> 14:02.052
My job is important to me.

14:04.925 --> 14:06.136
Ow!

14:06.136 --> 14:07.387
Be careful with my hair.

14:07.387 --> 14:08.728
Didn't you watch
the videos?

14:12.812 --> 14:13.974
Welcome back.

14:13.974 --> 14:16.186
I hope the chapter on
emergency brushing

14:16.186 --> 14:17.317
didn't scare you too much.

14:18.818 --> 14:20.860
Now let's discuss
some of the more

14:20.860 --> 14:22.362
advanced brush work.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.613
How did I
get here?

14:36.126 --> 14:38.208
Stan, what's wrong?

14:38.208 --> 14:39.499
You haven't looked
this sad

14:39.499 --> 14:41.501
since they decided
Pluto wasn't a planet.

14:41.501 --> 14:44.504
It was the only planet
named after a dog, Avery.

14:44.504 --> 14:45.635
The only one!

14:47.137 --> 14:48.768
But this is even worse.

14:48.768 --> 14:51.221
I went to take Princess out
on our second date,

14:51.221 --> 14:53.223
but her nasty,
rotten owner locked her up

14:53.223 --> 14:54.894
and told me to scat.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.316
At first I was gonna
lay down some...

14:56.316 --> 14:58.318
( gibberish )

15:02.022 --> 15:03.113
But then I realized

15:03.113 --> 15:04.864
that's probably not
what she meant.

15:06.116 --> 15:07.737
I'm sorry.

15:07.737 --> 15:10.790
But maybe it's just not meant
to be with you and Princess.

15:10.790 --> 15:12.202
Maybe it's time
to move on.

15:12.202 --> 15:13.203
I can't.

15:13.203 --> 15:15.205
I've never felt
this way before.

15:15.205 --> 15:17.998
But, Stan, you've dated
every dog in Pasadena,

15:17.998 --> 15:20.800
including a few who looked
suspiciously possumy.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.002
Oh.

15:22.002 --> 15:25.095
So what's so special
about Princess?

15:25.095 --> 15:27.007
Usually I can't connect
with other dogs

15:27.007 --> 15:28.638
because they don't talk.

15:28.638 --> 15:30.850
But it's different
with Princess.

15:30.850 --> 15:31.931
We connect in a way

15:31.931 --> 15:34.014
that I've never
experienced before.

15:34.014 --> 15:36.766
Wow, you're
really serious.

15:36.766 --> 15:38.518
Please, Avery,

15:38.518 --> 15:39.980
can't you just make
friends with Heather?

15:39.980 --> 15:42.482
Then she'll let Princess
and me be together.

15:42.482 --> 15:44.614
I can't make friends
with Heather.

15:44.614 --> 15:46.566
She's evil.
She spits bats.

15:46.566 --> 15:47.567
Her blood is acid.

15:47.567 --> 15:48.989
And she blew me off
in the quad.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.330
Okay, only one of those
things is true.

15:51.781 --> 15:54.624
Please, do whatever
it takes.

15:54.624 --> 15:55.835
You have to make
her like you

15:55.835 --> 15:57.577
so I can be
with Princess.

15:57.577 --> 15:58.578
All right, Stan.

15:58.578 --> 16:00.040
I see how much
this means to you.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.542
So I promise I'll try
and figure something out.

16:02.542 --> 16:04.634
Oh, thank you, Avery.

16:04.634 --> 16:06.586
'Cause I can't go back
to dating possums.

16:06.586 --> 16:08.928
Every time the check comes,
they play dead.

16:08.928 --> 16:10.760
Oh, come on!

16:18.978 --> 16:20.980
We've got to find a way
to get Heather to like us.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.942
Why is it so important
to you?

16:22.942 --> 16:23.983
It's not for me.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.155
It's for Stan.

16:25.155 --> 16:27.107
He really loves her dog.

16:27.107 --> 16:28.318
That's so sweet.

16:28.318 --> 16:30.990
Max, you don't usually
gush over stuff like this.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.493
Not the dumb dogs, I have
candy stuck in my teeth.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.666
If only we knew
more about her,

16:36.666 --> 16:39.039
what her interests are,
what she likes.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.501
Oh, well, I know one thing,
she didn't join chess club,

16:41.501 --> 16:42.882
but she did join
the glee club.

16:42.882 --> 16:44.504
Glee club?

16:44.504 --> 16:45.625
That's it.

16:45.625 --> 16:48.088
We could do
a musical number for her.

16:48.088 --> 16:49.889
She'll appreciate
that we made an effort

16:49.889 --> 16:52.052
to do something she likes
and want to be friends with us.

16:52.052 --> 16:52.972
That's nuts.

16:52.972 --> 16:53.973
You have nuts stuck
in your teeth, too?

16:53.973 --> 16:55.055
No.

17:50.990 --> 17:53.193
I said I don't
want to be friends.

17:53.193 --> 17:55.865
But you joined
the glee club.

17:55.865 --> 17:57.537
You love
musical numbers, right?

17:57.537 --> 18:01.831
I love doing them,
not watching people do them.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.794
So, goodbye.

18:08.168 --> 18:10.970
So there's no audition
for the glee club, is there?

18:10.970 --> 18:12.132
They just let anybody in.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.973
Yeah.

18:13.973 --> 18:15.094
I didn't get in.

18:20.930 --> 18:22.222
The neighbors are
coming up the walk!

18:22.222 --> 18:24.274
I saw them out the window!

18:24.274 --> 18:26.105
They have a casserole!

18:27.687 --> 18:29.108
Let's get out of here!
There's no time!

18:29.108 --> 18:30.990
Hit the deck!
What?

18:30.990 --> 18:31.991
( doorbell ringing )

18:35.865 --> 18:37.237
Please go away.

18:37.237 --> 18:38.908
Please go away.

18:38.908 --> 18:40.790
Please leave
the casserole dish.

18:40.790 --> 18:42.121
Please leave
the casserole dish.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.087
Honey,
what are we doing?

18:48.087 --> 18:49.799
We're going
to all this trouble

18:49.799 --> 18:52.712
to avoid some potential
awkwardness down the line.

18:52.712 --> 18:54.254
And it couldn't be any more
awkward than it is right now.

18:54.254 --> 18:55.555
You're right, Bennett.

18:55.555 --> 18:58.017
Let's just open the door
and talk to them.

18:58.017 --> 19:00.099
I think that's
the mature thing to do.

19:00.099 --> 19:01.140
They're gone.

19:02.812 --> 19:03.933
Yes!

19:03.933 --> 19:05.645
A new casserole dish!

19:08.188 --> 19:10.109
Vegan lasagna?

19:10.109 --> 19:11.150
What did we do to them?

19:16.236 --> 19:18.077
Chloe,
this isn't working.

19:18.077 --> 19:19.829
I wanted you
to be my assistant

19:19.829 --> 19:21.201
but you wanted
to play with Mason.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.162
Well, maybe
you should fire me

19:23.162 --> 19:24.083
and I'll fire Mason.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.245
That's a good idea.

19:25.245 --> 19:26.996
But first,
can you fix this?

19:29.088 --> 19:30.089
How did I get in here?

19:32.131 --> 19:34.794
He has a free spirit, Tyler.

19:34.794 --> 19:36.135
Don't try to control it.

19:37.967 --> 19:40.009
Well, no need to hide
from the neighbors anymore.

19:40.009 --> 19:42.302
Yeah, we realized we were
making things awkward

19:42.302 --> 19:45.064
by trying to avoid
having things be awkward.

19:45.064 --> 19:47.016
So we decided to go
over and talk to them.

19:47.016 --> 19:48.107
So everything
is gonna be okay?

19:48.107 --> 19:49.979
No, it's very awkward.

19:49.979 --> 19:53.152
Apparently, Avery embarrassed
their daughter at school

19:53.152 --> 19:55.194
with some crazy song
and dance number.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.277
And now they want nothing
to do with any of us.

19:57.277 --> 19:59.369
And why is Mason
inside your shirt?

20:01.991 --> 20:03.082
What is wrong
with our kids?

20:03.082 --> 20:04.704
It makes no sense.

20:04.704 --> 20:05.875
We're so normal.

20:12.292 --> 20:13.963
Hey, how'd it go
with Heather?

20:13.963 --> 20:15.004
Are you guys friends?

20:15.004 --> 20:16.135
Can I go see Princess?

20:17.216 --> 20:19.679
I did everything
I could, Stan.

20:19.679 --> 20:21.050
We even tried
to connect over the fact

20:21.050 --> 20:22.011
that she joined
the glee club.

20:22.011 --> 20:23.142
Well, did you do
a production number?

20:23.142 --> 20:24.264
Yes.

20:24.264 --> 20:25.645
Did you have
back-up dancers?

20:25.645 --> 20:26.806
Yes.

20:26.806 --> 20:27.807
Did you leave it all
on the dance floor?

20:27.807 --> 20:28.978
Yes!

20:29.979 --> 20:31.981
Then you've done
everything.

20:35.194 --> 20:37.196
I'm sorry, Stan.

20:37.196 --> 20:38.988
I can't believe
this is happening.

20:44.203 --> 20:49.038
You know, sometimes the most
painful thing is love.

20:49.038 --> 20:51.921
You were there for me
when Wes moved away

20:51.921 --> 20:53.042
and I'm here
for you now.

20:58.007 --> 20:59.258
Don't worry,

20:59.258 --> 21:01.090
I haven't
given up on Princess.

21:01.090 --> 21:03.142
Somehow, someway,

21:03.142 --> 21:06.095
someday, we'll be together.

21:06.095 --> 21:09.939
Until then she can hear me
from Avery's window.

21:09.939 --> 21:13.152
So I'll be sending
my love through song.

21:19.989 --> 21:24.454
♪ Love can be
so very hard ♪

21:24.454 --> 21:27.076
♪ When your
sweetheart's locked up ♪

21:27.076 --> 21:29.288
♪ In your
neighbor's yard ♪

21:29.288 --> 21:31.831
♪ But our souls
are adjoined ♪

21:31.831 --> 21:34.043
♪ And our hearts
are in tune ♪

21:34.043 --> 21:37.006
♪ And tonight
we're howling ♪

21:37.006 --> 21:40.880
♪ At the same full moon ♪

21:44.133 --> 21:45.094
( Princess howling )

21:45.094 --> 21:47.807
There she is.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.059
( howling )

21:50.059 --> 21:52.191
( dogs howling )

21:52.191 --> 21:54.894
Hey, why is
everyone howling?

21:54.894 --> 21:56.736
This isn't for you!

21:56.736 --> 21:58.738
We're having
a moment here!

21:58.738 --> 21:59.859
You write a love song

21:59.859 --> 22:01.280
and every dog thinks
it's about them.
