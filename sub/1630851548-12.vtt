09:07.566 --> 09:09.966
PERSON OF COLOR -- THAT SEEMS

09:10.033 --> 09:11.866
INSANE.

09:11.933 --> 09:13.300
>> I'M TRYING TO GO BACK AND

09:13.366 --> 09:15.833
THINK OF THE WORDS THAT SOMEBODY

09:15.900 --> 09:18.833
WHO IS MEANT TO BE AN EXPERT IN

09:18.900 --> 09:21.466
WOKE LANGUAGE HAS AS ACCEPTABLE

09:21.533 --> 09:21.666
TODAY.

09:21.733 --> 09:23.500
>> Bill: IT IS A WHOLE

09:23.566 --> 09:23.766
LANGUAGE.

09:23.833 --> 09:26.533
>> SAYING IT TOOK AWAY HER

09:26.600 --> 09:27.133
FEELINGS AND SHE'S ENTITLED TO

09:27.200 --> 09:29.933
HER FEELINGS.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.966
AND SHE WAS STRIPPED OF THOSE BY

09:34.033 --> 09:34.733
PIERCE.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.733
AND SHE WAS HAVING MENTAL

09:36.800 --> 09:39.333
PROBLEMS BECAUSE SHE WAS

09:39.400 --> 09:40.233
UNHAPPY, SO HE WAS STRIPPING HER

09:40.300 --> 09:42.533
OF HER FEELINGS WHICH SHE'S

09:42.600 --> 09:43.933
ENTITLED TO.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.800
>> Bill: MEGHAN MARKLE?

09:45.866 --> 09:50.000
>> YES.

09:50.066 --> 09:53.300
>> Bill: IS SHE EVEN AWARE?

09:53.366 --> 09:57.200
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AS YOU KNOW

09:57.266 --> 09:58.933
NOW, I'M SURE WHEN SHE GOT

09:59.000 --> 09:59.833
MARRIED TO PRINCE HARRY, SHE

09:59.900 --> 10:00.900
THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE LIKE

10:01.000 --> 10:03.966
A DISNEY MOVIE, I'M MARRYING A

10:04.033 --> 10:04.200
PRINCE.

10:04.266 --> 10:05.166
>> SHE SAID SHE FELT LIKE THE

10:05.233 --> 10:08.633
LITTLE MERMAID.

10:08.700 --> 10:09.533
[LAUGHTER]

10:09.600 --> 10:10.600
>> Bill: RIGHT, REALITY SETS

10:10.666 --> 10:11.533
IN AND BEING THE PRINCESS IS

10:11.600 --> 10:17.366
REALLY CUTTING THE RIBBON AT

10:17.433 --> 10:19.433
SOME WASTE MANAGEMENT FACILITY

10:19.500 --> 10:24.466
OPENING IN SHITVILLE.

10:24.533 --> 10:25.400
I'M SURE THE ROYAL FAMILY WAS

10:25.466 --> 10:28.400
CALLED TO HER, COULD THAT HAVE

10:28.466 --> 10:30.033
BEEN BECAUSE OF RACISM?

10:30.100 --> 10:30.466
POSSIBLY.

10:30.533 --> 10:35.566
THE OLD BAG IS 100.

10:35.633 --> 10:35.833
[LAUGHTER]

10:35.900 --> 10:38.300
[APPLAUSE]

10:38.366 --> 10:40.266
I THINK THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF

10:40.333 --> 10:41.466
THAT IN THERE, RACE, THEY ARE

10:41.533 --> 10:43.100
FROM THE EMPIRE, THE OLD SCHOOL

10:43.166 --> 10:45.300
BUT ALSO I THINK THEY ARE JUST

10:45.366 --> 10:47.366
COLD, TO EVERY ONE.

10:47.433 --> 10:48.100
>> SHE'S FROM A DIFFERENT

10:48.166 --> 10:48.666
GENERATION.

10:48.733 --> 10:50.433
>> Bill: THEY ARE COLD PEOPLE,

10:50.500 --> 10:52.900
SOME OF IT WAS RACISM AND SOME

10:52.966 --> 10:54.233
SHE PROBABLY TOOK AS RACISM,

10:54.300 --> 10:57.400
THEY ARE COLD TO EVERYBODY, GIR

10:57.466 --> 10:57.600
GIRL.

10:57.666 --> 10:59.900
[APPLAUSE]

10:59.966 --> 11:10.133
>> THEY ARE NOTORIOUSLY NONHUGY.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.866
I GET IT, BECAUSE OF HER AGE,

11:11.933 --> 11:14.800
SHE'S A DIFFERENT GENERATION.

11:14.866 --> 11:15.333
>> Bill: PIERS MORGAN I'VE

11:15.400 --> 11:18.533
HEARD YOU SAY ON REDDIT

11:18.600 --> 11:19.233
SOMEWHERE, THIS IS AN OLD FRIEND

11:19.300 --> 11:22.700
OF YOURS, YOU SAID THAT YOU

11:22.766 --> 11:24.100
SLAPPED HIM.

11:24.166 --> 11:25.666
>> YOU HAD TERRIBLE FIGHTS.

11:25.733 --> 11:27.333
>> Bill: YOU GOT DRUNK

11:27.400 --> 11:29.666
TOGETHER, HE'S SEEN YOUR TITS.

11:29.733 --> 11:34.466
>> JUST ONE.

11:34.533 --> 11:34.733
[LAUGHTER]

11:34.800 --> 11:35.000
[APPLAUSE]

11:35.066 --> 11:39.600
>> Bill: JUST A FRIEND.

11:39.666 --> 11:42.066
>> HE'S JUST A MATE OF MINE.

11:42.133 --> 11:46.633
>> Bill: THEN HOW DID HE SEE A

11:46.700 --> 11:47.100
TIT?

11:47.166 --> 11:47.366
[LAUGHTER]

11:47.433 --> 11:51.133
IT'S A REASONABLE QUESTION.

11:51.200 --> 11:55.300
>> BEHAVE.

11:55.366 --> 11:57.200
SO ANYWAY, YES I DID SLAP

11:57.266 --> 12:00.266
PIERCE, WE HAD A FIGHT ONE NIGHT

12:00.333 --> 12:00.933
AND IT WAS BRILLIANT AND WE MAKE

12:01.000 --> 12:02.433
UP THE NEXT DAY.

12:02.500 --> 12:06.300
>> Bill: RIGHT.

12:06.366 --> 12:08.033
YOU MENTIONED THIS, I HAVE THE

12:08.100 --> 12:11.633
EXACT QUOTE, IT'S FROM ELAINE

12:11.700 --> 12:14.266
WELTER OFF, SHE'S ONE OF YOUR

12:14.333 --> 12:15.966
COHOSTS OR WAS -- I THINK WHEN

12:16.033 --> 12:18.033
YOU DENY A WOMAN OR A WOMAN OF

12:18.100 --> 12:19.700
COLOR THEIR TRUTH AND THEIR

12:19.766 --> 12:20.833
EXPERIENCES, YOU'RE NOT JUST

12:20.900 --> 12:23.100
DENYING THEM, YOU'RE DENYING

12:23.166 --> 12:24.033
EVERY WOMAN OF COLOR WHO SEES

12:24.100 --> 12:27.666
THEM SELVES IN THIS STORY -- TO

12:27.733 --> 12:28.866
DENY A WOMAN, HE'S DOUBTING HER.

12:28.933 --> 12:31.466
THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS DENYING.

12:31.533 --> 12:32.533
YOU'RE ENTITLED TO YOUR THING

12:32.600 --> 12:36.800
AND I'M ENTITLED TO DOUBT.

12:36.866 --> 12:39.200
>> SHE'S ENTITLED TO HER

12:39.266 --> 12:40.366
OPINION, PIERCE IS ENTITLED TO

12:40.433 --> 12:40.533
HIS.

12:40.600 --> 12:44.433
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT

12:44.500 --> 12:47.166
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

12:47.233 --> 12:48.433
YOU'RE ENTITLED TO HAVE A

12:48.500 --> 12:50.600
DISAGREEMENT, DISCUSS IT IN A

12:50.666 --> 12:50.900
NORMAL WAY.

12:50.966 --> 12:54.733
>> Bill: ALL THIS DRAMA OVER

12:54.800 --> 12:56.266
SOMEBODY SAYING "I DON'T AGREE

12:56.333 --> 12:57.233
WITH MY FRIEND BUT HE'S ENTITLED

12:57.300 --> 13:00.300
TO HIS OPINION."

13:00.366 --> 13:01.500
OR EVEN I DO AGREE WITH HIM,

13:01.566 --> 13:06.400
WOULD HAVE BEEN OKAY WITH HIM MN

13:06.466 --> 13:07.066
MY BOOK.

13:07.133 --> 13:08.233
I DIDN'T AGREE WITH EVERYTHING

13:08.300 --> 13:10.666
SHE SAID, SHE SAID HARRY HAD THE

13:10.733 --> 13:12.300
WEIGHT OF THE WORLD ON HIS

13:12.366 --> 13:12.833
SHOULDERS.

13:12.900 --> 13:13.400
IT REALLY?

13:13.466 --> 13:15.900
EAST SIXTH IN LINE FOR A JOB

13:15.966 --> 13:16.733
THAT HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY.

13:16.800 --> 13:21.300
NO POWER.

13:21.366 --> 13:24.066
>> YOU KNOW WHEN THEY SAY WHITE

13:24.133 --> 13:25.933
PRIVILEGE, RIGHT THERE, WITH

13:26.000 --> 13:26.133
HARRY.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.233
RIGHT THERE.

13:28.300 --> 13:31.366
HE IS THE POSTER BOY.

13:31.433 --> 13:33.966
HE SITS THERE AND SAYS DADDY CUT

13:34.033 --> 13:35.233
HIM OFF, SO HE'S NOT ON THE

13:35.300 --> 13:37.566
WAGES ANYMORE.

13:37.633 --> 13:41.833
AND HE WAS BOO-HOO ABOUT IT, YOU

13:41.900 --> 13:45.666
CAN'T FEEL EMPATHY FOR THAT

13:45.733 --> 13:47.433
BECAUSE YOU'RE A HEALTHY,

13:47.500 --> 13:48.766
BRIGHT, EDUCATED YOUNG MAN, YOU

13:48.833 --> 13:50.166
CAN DO EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO

13:50.233 --> 13:51.666
DO, YOUR LIFE IS YOUR OWN.

13:51.733 --> 13:53.100
>> Bill: THEY ARE LIVING IN A

13:53.166 --> 13:55.633
GIANT MANSION NEXT DOOR TO OPEN

13:55.700 --> 13:57.966
>> IS GREAT!

13:58.033 --> 13:59.200
>> Bill: LET'S LET EVERYONE --

13:59.266 --> 14:01.800
>> JUST DO YOUR THING, THAT'S

14:01.866 --> 14:04.300
ALL.

14:04.366 --> 14:04.933
DISAGREEING WITH SOMEBODY DOES

14:05.000 --> 14:07.166
NOT MAKE YOU A RACIST.

14:07.233 --> 14:08.200
>> Bill: OF COURSE NOT, LET'S

14:08.266 --> 14:11.233
GET ON TO THE OTHER PART OF IT

14:11.300 --> 14:11.600
WHICH IS THAT --

14:11.666 --> 14:13.666
[APPLAUSE]

14:13.733 --> 14:15.333
THIS IS THE PART OF THE CULTURE

14:15.400 --> 14:16.533
THAT I'M NOT LOVING WHERE

14:16.600 --> 14:18.500
EVERYONE IS A SNITCH NOW?

14:18.566 --> 14:22.433
IF SOMETHING COMES OUT -- YOUR

14:22.500 --> 14:25.766
CURRENT HOST SAID THEY NEVER

14:25.833 --> 14:29.133
HEARD YOU SAY ANYTHING RACIST

14:29.200 --> 14:32.433
BUT SOME OF THE PAST LADIES,

14:32.500 --> 14:35.966
THEY SAID YOU TALK SHIT.

14:36.033 --> 14:39.400
>> YOU CAN SAY IT.

14:39.466 --> 14:43.566
>> Bill: ASIAN SLUR, LESBIAN

14:43.633 --> 14:49.966
SLUR -- WE DON'T CONDONE ANY BAD

14:50.033 --> 14:51.066
LANGUAGE ANYWHERE BUT I'M JUST

14:51.133 --> 14:53.466
SAYING FIRST OF ALL WE ARE

14:53.533 --> 14:54.033
TALKING ABOUT FOUR LADIES.

14:54.100 --> 14:56.633
I KNOW MEN ARE DOGS.

14:56.700 --> 15:01.466
>> AND WE ARE BITCHES.

15:01.533 --> 15:03.600
>> Bill: YOU SAID IT, NOT ME.

15:03.666 --> 15:09.066
>> THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES.

15:09.133 --> 15:11.400
"JESUS, DID YOU SEE WHAT SHE WAS

15:11.466 --> 15:15.933
JUST WEARING" AND YOU GO "HI,

15:16.000 --> 15:17.033
YOU LOOK GREAT."

15:17.100 --> 15:18.300
>> Bill: YOU ARE OWNING

15:18.366 --> 15:21.033
TALKING SHIT ABOUT THEM.

15:21.100 --> 15:22.433
>> THEY USE THE WRONG TERM.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.766
>> Bill: THEY SAID IT ABOUT

15:23.833 --> 15:31.200
YOU >> I NEVER SAID THAT LEAH

15:31.266 --> 15:33.333
RIMINI -- I DON'T EVEN USE THOSE

15:33.400 --> 15:36.633
WORDS, THEY ARE NOT IN MY

15:36.700 --> 15:38.933
VOCABULARY.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.866
FOR HOLLY, I THINK I SAID IT ALL

15:40.933 --> 15:42.533
WHEN I PRINTED THE TEXT THAT SHE

15:42.600 --> 15:46.233
SENT ME AFTER SHE SAID I GOT HER

15:46.300 --> 15:48.366
FIRED, IN THE TEXT SHE SAYS "I

15:48.433 --> 15:50.933
KNOW IT WAS JULIE, I'M THINKING

15:51.000 --> 15:53.633
OF SUING."

15:53.700 --> 15:54.733
IT'S DISGRUNTLED LADIES.

15:54.800 --> 15:55.666
>> Bill: WHAT ABOUT THIS STORY

15:55.733 --> 15:59.866
NOW THAT I'M READING, ABOUT

15:59.933 --> 16:02.300
SOMEONE WHO IS IRANIAN WHO YOU

16:02.366 --> 16:09.000
CALLED A PERSIAN SOMETHING --

16:09.066 --> 16:10.200
>> THEY GATE CRASHED MY

16:10.266 --> 16:12.600
HUSBAND'S AND MY WEDDING

16:12.666 --> 16:15.033
ANNIVERSARY, THEY WERE NOT

16:15.100 --> 16:15.266
INVITED.

16:15.333 --> 16:17.433
I WAS ON CHEMO.

16:17.500 --> 16:20.700
I DON'T KNOW THIS PERSON.

16:20.766 --> 16:22.866
>> Bill: NOT A GUEST OF THE

16:22.933 --> 16:23.066
GUEST?

16:23.133 --> 16:24.766
>> DON'T KNOW THEM, SHE GATE

16:24.833 --> 16:28.400
CRASHED A PARTY, SHE WON A

16:28.466 --> 16:29.666
RAFFLE WHICH WAS A DIAMOND

16:29.733 --> 16:32.933
NECKLACE AND SHE TOOK IT.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.366
>> Bill: WELL, SHE WON IT.

16:37.433 --> 16:38.600
SHE DID WIN THE RAFFLE ARE YOU

16:38.666 --> 16:41.200
SAYING SHE CHEATED ON THAT TOO?

16:41.266 --> 16:42.766
ANYONE WHO WOULD CRASH A PARTY

16:42.833 --> 16:47.700
WOULD CHEAT ON A RAFFLE.

16:47.766 --> 16:50.233
>> IT WAS A VERY PERSONAL THING,

16:50.300 --> 16:51.100
WE HAD OUR 25TH WEDDING

16:51.166 --> 16:54.266
ANNIVERSARY, I WAS COMING BACK

16:54.333 --> 16:55.200
FROM CANCER, SHE TOOK THE

16:55.266 --> 16:57.233
NECKLACE AND I SAID I'LL TELL

16:57.300 --> 16:59.033
YOU WHAT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I

16:59.100 --> 17:01.433
SAID TO HER BUT IT WASN'T VERY

17:01.500 --> 17:02.200
NICE.

17:02.266 --> 17:03.333
AND I TOLD HER TO BRING THE

17:03.400 --> 17:09.600
FUCKING T NECKLACE NOW YOU BITCH

17:09.666 --> 17:12.100

17:12.433 --> 17:13.066
YOU RUINED MY PARTY, I DON'T

17:13.133 --> 17:15.033
EVEN KNOW YOU.

17:15.100 --> 17:15.600
>> Bill: MAYBE THIS WASN'T

17:15.666 --> 17:20.400
YOUR FINEST HOUR, MY POINT WOULD

17:20.466 --> 17:22.166
BE WE CAN'T JUDGE EVERYBODY BY

17:22.233 --> 17:27.300
THEIR WORST MOMENT.

17:27.366 --> 17:29.800
HOW ABOUT JUST -- I SHOULDN'T DO

17:29.866 --> 17:32.866
THAT, YOU DID ISSUE AN APOLOGY

17:32.933 --> 17:34.900
FOR THIS AND I WAS LIKE I READ

17:34.966 --> 17:36.833
IN IT THE WORDS I'M GOING TO

17:36.900 --> 17:38.300
EDUCATE MYSELF, WE CAN ALL DO

17:38.366 --> 17:40.500
BETTER, OF COURSE, WE CAN ALL DO

17:40.566 --> 17:43.766
BETTER BUT THIS IDEA IN CULTURE

17:43.833 --> 17:44.266
NOW THAT PEOPLE NEED TO

17:44.333 --> 17:47.066
REEDUCATE THEMSELVES,

17:47.133 --> 17:47.600
INDOCTRINATE THEMSELVES.

17:47.666 --> 17:49.933
I'M SORRY, I'M 65, YOUR 68, I

17:50.000 --> 17:52.966
KNOW WHO I AM.

17:53.033 --> 17:56.500
I DON'T NEED REEDUCATION.

17:56.566 --> 17:58.466
DO YOU NEED REEDUCATION?

17:58.533 --> 17:59.866
YOU'VE BEEN AROUND THE WORLD,

17:59.933 --> 18:01.533
YOU'RE MARRIED TO A ROCK STAR,

18:01.600 --> 18:04.466
YOU'VE BEEN WITH THE A-LISTERS

PEOPLE ARE WHO THEY ARE.

18:14.033 --> 18:17.900
>> THIS WORD THEY THROW OUT

18:17.966 --> 18:21.166
ABOUT THE "CANCEL CULTURE" AND

18:21.233 --> 18:21.900
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:22.000 --> 18:31.066
I'M GOING TO BE FINE.

18:31.133 --> 18:31.966
>> Bill: I DON'T READ THE

18:32.033 --> 18:37.433
TABLOIDS EVERY WEEK "EVERYONE IS

18:37.500 --> 18:39.233
LINING UP TO GET SHARON

18:39.300 --> 18:40.200
OSBOURNE'S FIRST INTERVIEW."

18:40.266 --> 18:42.633
WAIT, I'M RIGHT HERE, I DID IT.

18:42.700 --> 18:43.900
DON'T WORRY ABOUT SHARON, SHE'S

18:43.966 --> 18:45.666
NOT LOOKING FOR WORK, IT'S

18:45.733 --> 18:47.200
LOOKING FOR HER.

18:47.266 --> 18:47.733
THERE HAVE BEEN OFFERS FOR

18:47.800 --> 18:51.100
SHARON TO HOST HER OWN SOLO SHOW

18:51.166 --> 18:54.300
EVEN TALKING ABOUT WORKING WITH

18:54.366 --> 18:59.166
PIERS MORGAN ON A LATE NIGHT

18:59.233 --> 19:01.466
POLITICALLY INCORRECT SHOW."

19:01.533 --> 19:03.633
I DONE A SHOW CALLED POLITICALLY

19:03.700 --> 19:04.066
INCORRECT!

19:04.133 --> 19:05.900
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE, HOWEVER I'M

19:05.966 --> 19:07.866
A FIGHTER, I'M FINE, I'M DOING

19:07.933 --> 19:10.800
JUST FINE, WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE

19:10.866 --> 19:12.166
WHO ARE CUT FROM THE KNEES DOWN

19:12.233 --> 19:15.766
AND THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO GO GET

19:15.833 --> 19:17.866
LESSONS ON WHAT POLITICALLY

19:17.933 --> 19:20.166
CORRECT AND HOW TO TALK TO

19:20.233 --> 19:20.400
PEOPLE?

19:20.466 --> 19:23.066
WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM?

19:23.133 --> 19:28.166
IT'S NOT FAIR BECAUSE IT ISN'T

19:28.233 --> 19:30.366
ABOUT BEING A RACIST, IT'S ABOUT

19:30.433 --> 19:34.233
NOT KNOWING WHAT IS CORRECT AND

19:34.300 --> 19:36.033
WOKE FOR YOUR LANGUAGE THAT DAY.

19:36.100 --> 19:37.900
IT CHANGES FROM DAY-TO-DAY, WHAT

19:37.966 --> 19:42.100
IS CORRECT AND WHAT ISN'T.

19:42.166 --> 19:44.833
YOU READ WHITE FRAGILITY.

19:44.900 --> 19:47.033
>> Bill: THAT WOMAN GAVE YOU

19:47.100 --> 19:48.633
THE BOOK WHITE FRAGILITY.

19:48.700 --> 19:50.433
>> I READ IT AND SOME OF IT IS

19:50.500 --> 19:52.000
VERY INFORMATIVE AND THE OTHER

19:52.066 --> 19:54.633
I'M LIKE I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU.

19:54.700 --> 19:55.900
>> Bill: I DON'T HAVE TO AGREE

19:55.966 --> 19:59.000
WITH EVERYTHING.

19:59.066 --> 20:01.733
THE IDEA IS YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES

20:01.800 --> 20:03.233
IF YOU ARE WHITE, YOU ARE EITHER

20:03.300 --> 20:03.833
A RACIST OR A RACIST AND YOU

20:03.900 --> 20:07.266
DON'T KNOW IT.

20:07.333 --> 20:08.100
I'M NOT DOWN WITH THAT.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.033
>> I'M NOT DONE WITH THAT

20:10.100 --> 20:10.266
EITHER.

20:10.333 --> 20:12.066
>> Bill: I KNOW WHO RAISED ME,

20:12.133 --> 20:13.600
I KNOW WHO MY FRIENDS ARE, I

20:13.666 --> 20:17.100
KNOW HOW I'VE TREATED PEOPLE.

20:17.166 --> 20:21.433
>> YOU CANNOT BLANKET ANY RACE,

20:21.500 --> 20:23.833
THERE IS GOOD AND BAD IN EVERY

20:23.900 --> 20:25.066
RACE, YOU DON'T A BLANKET A

20:25.133 --> 20:25.300
BLANKET.

20:25.366 --> 20:28.433
>> Bill: WE'LL SEE YOU ON THE

20:28.500 --> 20:29.266
NEXT SHOW.

20:29.333 --> 20:31.866
SHARON OSBOURNE, EVERYBODY!

20:31.933 --> 20:39.133
LET'S MEET OUR PANEL!

20:39.200 --> 20:40.733

20:43.166 --> 20:45.033
PBS' "GZERO WORLD WITH IAN

20:45.100 --> 20:51.566
BREMMER": IAN BREMMER.

20:51.633 --> 20:53.000
SHE'S THE FORMER SENIOR PENTAGON

20:53.066 --> 20:54.866
OFFICIAL UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA

20:54.933 --> 20:56.500

20:56.566 --> 20:58.300
"TANGLED UP IN BLUE: POLICING

20:58.366 --> 21:05.833
THE AMERICAN CITY": ROSA BROOKS.

21:05.900 --> 21:12.233
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

21:12.300 --> 21:12.833
WITH ALL THE POLICING IN THE

21:12.900 --> 21:15.300
NEWS IN THE LAST WEEK OR SO I

21:15.366 --> 21:17.266
SAID TO MY STAFF CAN YOU BOOK ME

21:17.333 --> 21:18.666
A BRILLIANT JOURNALIST TO QUIT

21:18.733 --> 21:20.366
HER JOB IN HER 40s TO ACTUALLY

21:20.433 --> 21:22.066
BECOME A COP, GIVE ME A LIST.

21:22.133 --> 21:23.366
AND YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE ON THE

21:23.433 --> 21:25.000
LIST.

21:25.066 --> 21:27.166
>> I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ON THE

21:27.233 --> 21:29.066
LIST, I DIDN'T ACTUALLY QUIT MY

21:29.133 --> 21:29.466
JOB.

21:29.533 --> 21:32.200
>> Bill: BUT YOU BECAME A COP.

21:32.266 --> 21:34.033
WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM THAT

21:34.100 --> 21:35.566
EXPERIENCE THAT WOULD HELP US

21:35.633 --> 21:36.400
GET THROUGH THIS DIFFICULT

21:36.466 --> 21:38.733
MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY?

21:38.800 --> 21:41.366
>> HERE'S A DIRTY LITTLE SECRET

21:41.433 --> 21:42.500
ABOUT COPS, THEY DON'T REALLY

21:42.566 --> 21:45.466
GET MUCH TRAINING IN HOW TO USE

21:45.533 --> 21:46.033
THEIR WEAPONS.

21:46.100 --> 21:48.200
WHEN I WENT THROUGH THE POLICE

21:48.266 --> 21:50.833
ACADEMY, WE HAD TWO WEEKS IN

21:50.900 --> 21:53.800
FIREARMS TRAINING, YOU QUALIFY,

21:53.866 --> 21:57.933
YOUR DONE, TWICE A YEAR YOU

21:58.000 --> 21:59.866
REQUALIFY, YOU WATCH A FEW

21:59.933 --> 22:02.366
POWERPOINT SLIDES.

22:02.433 --> 22:05.000
>> Bill: THIS IS WHAT I

22:05.066 --> 22:05.233
THOUGHT.

22:05.300 --> 22:06.333
>> YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE

22:06.400 --> 22:07.833
WALKING AROUND WITH WEAPONS WHO

22:07.900 --> 22:09.533
DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE

22:09.600 --> 22:10.200
DOING.

22:10.266 --> 22:10.800
>> Bill: INTERESTING.

22:10.866 --> 22:12.933
IT SEEMED TO BE THE THEME, A LOT

22:13.000 --> 22:15.666
OF IT IS CYNICISM.

22:15.733 --> 22:17.300
>> YEAH.

22:17.366 --> 22:19.066
>> Bill: IS REALLY THE

22:19.133 --> 22:19.533
OVERARCHING PROBLEM.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.033
RACISM IS PART OF IT, A LOT OF

22:21.100 --> 22:23.633
THINGS ARE PART OF IT BUT THEY

22:23.700 --> 22:25.066
ARE JUST BEATEN DOWN.

22:25.133 --> 22:27.700
>> WE ASKED COPS TO BE SOCIAL

22:27.766 --> 22:29.866
WORKERS AND MEDICS AND WARRIORS

22:29.933 --> 22:30.900
AND MEDIATORS AND ANY ONE OF

22:30.966 --> 22:32.600
THOSE JOBS IS REALLY HARD AND

22:32.666 --> 22:33.333
MOST PEOPLE CAN'T DO ANY ONE OF

22:33.400 --> 22:36.833
THOSE JOBS REALLY WELL.

22:36.900 --> 22:38.366
IF YOU ASKED SOME 25-YEAR-OLDS

22:38.433 --> 22:39.333
DO ALL OF THEM IN THE SAME

22:39.400 --> 22:40.166
10-HOUR SHIFT, THEY ARE GOING TO

22:40.233 --> 22:44.600
DO THEM REALLY BADLY.

22:44.666 --> 22:46.233
SUICIDE KILLS MORE COPS EVERY

22:46.300 --> 22:48.200
SINGLE YEAR THAN EVERY OTHER

22:48.266 --> 22:48.600
BECAUSE COMBINED.

22:48.666 --> 22:50.566
>> Bill: THAT YOU SEE PAT

22:50.633 --> 22:51.333
ROBERTSON IS SPEAKING OUT

22:51.400 --> 22:53.400
AGAINST THE COPS?

22:53.466 --> 22:55.500
>> HE CAME ACROSS AS WOKE IN

22:55.566 --> 22:56.666
THAT INTERVIEW, THE ONLY TIME I

22:56.733 --> 22:58.633
WOULD EVER USE THAT WORD FOR

22:58.700 --> 22:58.800
HIM.

22:58.866 --> 23:01.166
>> Bill: I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S

23:01.233 --> 23:03.900
LITERALLY WOKE.

23:03.966 --> 23:07.800
COME ON.

23:07.866 --> 23:10.200
YOU ALSO SAID YOU THINK MOST

23:10.266 --> 23:11.633
COPS ARE DECENT, COMPASSIONATE

23:11.700 --> 23:13.133
PEOPLE.

23:13.200 --> 23:13.600
I DO TOO.

23:13.666 --> 23:16.066
>> MOST PEOPLE DON'T WAKE UP IN

23:16.133 --> 23:17.400
THE MORNING SAYING I'M GOING TO

23:17.466 --> 23:19.166
FUCK SOME PEOPLE'S LIVES

23:19.233 --> 23:20.400
UP-TO-DATE -- SOME PEOPLE DO BUT

23:20.466 --> 23:21.766
THEY ARE WORKING IN A SYSTEM

23:21.833 --> 23:23.000
THAT EVEN IF YOU ARE A GOOD COP

23:23.066 --> 23:23.766
YOU ARE GOING TO SCREW PEOPLE'S

23:23.833 --> 23:27.200
LIVES UP.

23:27.266 --> 23:28.133
>> Bill: I WAS GRATIFIED TO

23:28.200 --> 23:29.500
SEE IN YOUR BOOK THERE ARE A

23:29.566 --> 23:31.666
NUMBER OF THINGS I'VE BEEN

23:31.733 --> 23:32.766
STAYING HERE FOR MANY YEARS.

23:32.833 --> 23:37.466
I SAID LAST WEEK ON THE SHOW.

23:37.533 --> 23:39.033
IT'S NOT IN THE TOP TEN OF RISKY

23:39.100 --> 23:39.666
JOBS.

23:39.733 --> 23:41.600
WE GET IT, THERE IS DANGER AND

23:41.666 --> 23:43.366
CERTAINLY A LOT OF STRESS.

23:43.433 --> 23:47.033
IT'S RIGHT IN YOUR BOOK, IT'S

23:47.100 --> 23:48.566
NOT IN YOUR TOP TEN.

23:48.633 --> 23:50.100
MY THING IS AT SOME POINT THEY

23:50.166 --> 23:52.133
GOT IN THEIR HEAD THAT IF THEY

23:52.200 --> 23:53.933
ARE IN ANY DANGER AT ALL, JUST

23:54.000 --> 23:56.033
EMPTY THE CLIP INTO WHAT'S

23:56.100 --> 23:58.600
MAKING YOU NERVOUS.

23:58.666 --> 24:00.000
THAT IS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE

24:00.066 --> 24:02.966
WHAT HAS TO STOP.

24:03.033 --> 24:06.666
THEY ARE TOO JITTERY.

24:06.733 --> 24:08.633
AND YOU SAY IT'S PUT IN THEIR

24:08.700 --> 24:08.833
HEAD.

24:08.900 --> 24:10.300
>> YOU WATCH THE VIDEOS OVER AND

24:10.366 --> 24:12.533
OVER OF COPS GETTING KILLED AND

24:12.600 --> 24:15.266
COPS GET KILLED, BUT NOT THAT

24:15.333 --> 24:17.433
MANY OF THEM ACTUALLY GET KILLED

24:17.500 --> 24:18.766
BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE AREN'T

24:18.833 --> 24:19.633
TRYING TO KILL THEM.

24:19.700 --> 24:22.033
BUT IF ALL YOU HEAR OVER AND

24:22.100 --> 24:23.800
OVER IS THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS

24:23.866 --> 24:25.366
A ROUTINE CALL, ANY SITUATION

24:25.433 --> 24:26.400
CAN TURN LETHAL IN A

24:26.466 --> 24:28.600
MILLISECOND, THEN YOU GO INTO

24:28.666 --> 24:29.633
ALL OF YOUR INTERACTIONS PRIMED

24:29.700 --> 24:31.300
TO THINK EVERYBODY IS A THREAT

24:31.366 --> 24:32.600
TO PEER TO SOMEBODY REACHES INTO

24:32.666 --> 24:33.466
THEIR POCKET YOU DON'T THINK

24:33.533 --> 24:35.366
THEY ARE REACHING FOR A TISSUE

24:35.433 --> 24:37.033
OR THEIR PHONE, YOU THINK

24:37.100 --> 24:38.300
THEY'RE GOING TO KILL YOU AND

24:38.366 --> 24:39.933
YOU GET PANICKY COPS WITHOUT

24:40.000 --> 24:40.633
MUCH WEAPONS TRAINING AND THEY

24:40.700 --> 24:43.633
SHOOT AND PEOPLE END UP DEAD.

24:43.700 --> 24:48.100
>> Bill: THIS GUY WHO GOT

24:48.166 --> 24:52.233
TASERED, DID HE EVEN NEED TO BE

24:52.300 --> 24:53.000
TASED?

24:53.066 --> 24:53.766
HE WAS RESISTING ARREST, HE WAS

24:53.833 --> 24:55.733
TRYING TO DRIVE AWAY BUT WAS IT

24:55.800 --> 24:57.533
THAT IMPORTANT TO STOP HIM?

24:57.600 --> 25:01.200
WHAT IF YOU TASED SOMEONE WHILE

25:01.266 --> 25:02.000
THEY'RE DRIVING?

25:02.066 --> 25:03.300
OUT WITH LOOKING AT A WORSE

25:03.366 --> 25:03.666
ACCIDENT?

25:03.733 --> 25:05.433
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF COUNTRIES

25:05.500 --> 25:06.400
AROUND THE WORLD, WEALTHY

25:06.466 --> 25:07.533
DEMOCRACIES WHO HAVE POLICE

25:07.600 --> 25:09.800
FORCES, WE DON'T SEE THIS

25:09.866 --> 25:10.900
PROBLEM.

25:10.966 --> 25:13.066
THIS COUNTRY IS SO INCREDIBLY

25:13.133 --> 25:14.266
DIVIDED.

25:14.333 --> 25:16.000
"A BLUE LIVES MATTER" HAS BECOME

25:16.066 --> 25:19.166
A POLITICAL LITMUS TEST FOR

25:19.233 --> 25:19.633
WHICH COUNTRY IN THE

25:19.700 --> 25:22.533
UNITED STATES YOU ARE A PART OF.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.166
IF YOU REMEMBER THE POLICE

25:24.233 --> 25:24.800
FORCE, YOU'RE AUTOMATICALLY ON

25:24.866 --> 25:27.566
ONE SIDE OF THAT.

25:27.633 --> 25:30.033
THAT MAKES IT SO MUCH HARDER TO

25:30.100 --> 25:31.600
DO THE RIGHT THING OR TO

25:31.666 --> 25:32.566
INTERFERE WHEN SOMEONE HAS THEIR

25:32.633 --> 25:35.300
KNEE ON SOMEONE'S NECK AND IS

25:35.366 --> 25:37.233
TAKING THEIR LIFE.

25:37.300 --> 25:38.666
>> Bill: WE AREN'T REALLY

25:38.733 --> 25:39.633
ALLOWED TO HAVE TWO THOUGHTS IN

25:39.700 --> 25:42.366
OUR HEADS AT THE SAME TIME.

25:42.433 --> 25:43.600
THE TWO THOUGHTS HERE WOULD BE

25:43.666 --> 25:44.233
"THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE

25:44.300 --> 25:46.766
FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO THESE

25:46.833 --> 25:49.633
PEOPLE WHEN THEY GOT SHOT, BUT

25:49.700 --> 25:51.933
IT'S ALSO GOOD ADVICE -- DON'T

25:52.000 --> 25:54.466
RESIST ARREST."

25:54.533 --> 25:57.433
IT'S NOT AN EXCUSE FOR THE COP

25:57.500 --> 26:00.200
SHOOTING THIS PERSON, BUT THAT

26:00.266 --> 26:02.800
JUST NEVER ENDS WELL.

26:02.866 --> 26:05.600
THAT IS NOT THE PLACE TO MAKE

26:05.666 --> 26:05.900
YOUR STAND.

26:05.966 --> 26:08.133
>> ONE THING I THINK PEOPLE LOSE

26:08.200 --> 26:09.333
SIGHT OF -- ALTHOUGH LESS AND

26:09.400 --> 26:11.800
LESS BECAUSE I THINK THE DEBATE

26:11.866 --> 26:12.666
ABOUT POLICING HAS REALLY

26:12.733 --> 26:14.200
CHANGED IN HEALTHY WAYS IN THIS

26:14.266 --> 26:18.900
COUNTRY IS THAT COPS DON'T MAKE

26:18.966 --> 26:20.866
THE LAWS THEY ENFORCE, WE ARE

26:20.933 --> 26:22.600
THE BOZOS WHO VOTE FOR THE BOZOS

26:22.666 --> 26:23.833
WHO MAKE THE STUPID LAWS THAT

26:23.900 --> 26:25.966
LEAD COPS TO ARREST PEOPLE FOR

26:26.033 --> 26:26.633
STUPID STUFF.

26:26.700 --> 26:29.033
>> Bill: LIKE THE AIR

26:29.100 --> 26:29.366
FRESHENER.

26:29.433 --> 26:30.333
OF THESE FUCKING LEGISLATORS SIT

26:30.400 --> 26:32.000
AROUND ALL DAY TRYING TO JUSTIFY

26:32.066 --> 26:34.233
THEIR JOB, RIGHT DUMB LAWS AND

26:34.300 --> 26:35.800
SOMEBODY HAS TO ENFORCE THE LAW.

26:35.866 --> 26:38.766
>> THEY DON'T, ACTUALLY.

26:38.833 --> 26:40.733
HANG ON A SECOND, THERE ARE LAWS

26:40.800 --> 26:42.200
WE DON'T NEED TO ENFORCE BUT IF

26:42.266 --> 26:43.633
WE PASS THEM AND SAY TO THE COPS

26:43.700 --> 26:45.933
YOU DO IT, THEY GO DO IT.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.066
>> Bill: THAT'S WHAT I'M

26:47.133 --> 26:47.300
SAYING.

26:47.366 --> 26:49.100
>> I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS,

26:49.166 --> 26:51.366
YOU ALL MAY REMEMBER, I DID NOT

26:51.433 --> 26:53.700
REMEMBER APRIL 15TH IS WHEN IRS

26:53.766 --> 26:54.266
ESTIMATED TAXES WERE DUE.

26:54.333 --> 26:55.100
>> Bill: NOT THIS YEAR.

26:55.166 --> 26:58.733
>> IF YOU FORGET.

26:58.800 --> 27:00.133
>> Bill: WE GIVE UP ON MONDAY,

27:00.200 --> 27:01.266
WE ARE JUST PRINTING IT.

27:01.333 --> 27:04.100
>> IF YOU MISS THAT DEADLINE,

27:04.166 --> 27:07.200
THE IRS DOESN'T SEND A GUIDE TO

27:07.266 --> 27:08.933
THE FRONT DOOR THE NEXT DAY,

27:09.000 --> 27:09.933
THEY SEND YOU A NASTY LETTER AND

27:10.000 --> 27:11.333
THEY SEND YOU ANOTHER NASTY

27:11.400 --> 27:12.133
LETTER AND ANOTHER NASTY LETTER

27:12.200 --> 27:14.366
AND THAT GOES ON FOR ABOUT SIX

27:14.433 --> 27:14.566
YEARS.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.200
EVENTUALLY YOU MIGHT GET A

27:17.266 --> 27:17.433
SUMMONS.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.500
>> Bill: TELL THAT TO WESLEY

27:19.566 --> 27:20.066
SNIPES.

27:20.133 --> 27:21.800
>> WE'VE DECIDED AS A COUNTRY

27:21.866 --> 27:24.433
THAT WE WANT TO HAVE ARMED

27:24.500 --> 27:26.500
UNIFORMED PEOPLE ENFORCE CIVIL

27:26.566 --> 27:28.700
REGULATIONS AND INEVITABLY THAT

27:28.766 --> 27:31.200
MEANS MORE TRAFFIC STOPS, MORE

27:31.266 --> 27:31.733
PEOPLE DIED BECAUSE THOSE

27:31.800 --> 27:34.000
INTERACTIONS ARE REALLY FRAUGHT.

27:34.066 --> 27:35.433
IT'S CRAZY, WE DON'T NEED TO DO

27:35.500 --> 27:37.833
THAT, WE DON'T NEED TO DO IT AT

27:37.900 --> 27:38.800
ALL.

27:38.866 --> 27:39.800
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO

27:39.866 --> 27:41.233
PULL PEOPLE OVER FOR STUPID

27:41.300 --> 27:41.600
STUFF LIKE THAT.

27:41.666 --> 27:44.933
WE CAN HAVE SPEED CAMERAS AND

27:45.000 --> 27:46.033
CIVILIANS WHO WRITE TICKETS

27:46.100 --> 27:47.366
BASED ON LICENSE PLATE NUMBER,

27:47.433 --> 27:48.300
WE CAN DECIDE THE AIR FRESHENER

27:48.366 --> 27:53.200
IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WH WHEREE

27:53.266 --> 27:54.000
HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT.

27:54.066 --> 27:55.800
>> WE DO KNOW RAISES AN ISSUE,

27:55.866 --> 27:57.466
I'M AWARE OF THE FACT THAT WE

27:57.533 --> 27:58.566
ARE THREE WHITE FOLKS TALKING

27:58.633 --> 27:59.433
ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.800
>> Bill: THAT'S OKAY, THREE

28:01.866 --> 28:02.666
WHITE PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO

28:02.733 --> 28:03.333
TALK.

28:03.400 --> 28:04.966
>> WE ARE ALLOWED TO.

28:05.033 --> 28:06.733
>> Bill: I'M SORRY EVERY SHOW

28:06.800 --> 28:11.200
CAN'T BE A BENETTON AD.

28:11.266 --> 28:13.166
YOU KIND OF ARE -- IT'S ALWAYS

28:13.233 --> 28:15.000
LIKE --

28:15.066 --> 28:16.833
>> IT'S MORE JUST THAT THE

28:16.900 --> 28:19.600
STRUCTURAL RACISM THAT IS IN THE

28:19.666 --> 28:21.333
SYSTEM THAT IS FAR DEEPER THAN

28:21.400 --> 28:22.800
POLICING IS SOMETHING WHERE IF

28:22.866 --> 28:24.266
YOU ARE A BLACK PERSON BEING

28:24.333 --> 28:25.866
PULLED OVER, RESISTING ARREST IS

28:25.933 --> 28:28.833
A HELL OF A LOT MORE DANGEROUS,

28:28.900 --> 28:31.900
THAT'S THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE.

28:31.966 --> 28:32.166
[APPLAUSE]

28:32.233 --> 28:34.300
>> Bill: IT'S SO DEEP IN THE

28:34.366 --> 28:36.733
SYSTEM THAT IN THE FREDDIE GRAY

28:36.800 --> 28:41.400
TRAGEDY, ATROCITY, THE ENTIRE

28:41.466 --> 28:42.800
HIGHER ECHELON WAS BLACK.

28:42.866 --> 28:44.300
THE MAYOR WAS BLACK, THE CHIEF

28:44.366 --> 28:45.500
OF POLICE WERE BLACK, SOME OF

28:45.566 --> 28:47.133
THE OFFICERS -- THAT'S HOW DEEP

28:47.200 --> 28:50.666
THE SYSTEM IT GOES.

28:50.733 --> 28:52.733
RASHIDA TLAIB WHO WAS THE

28:52.800 --> 28:53.466
CONGRESSWOMAN -- I SEE YOU

28:53.533 --> 28:58.266
ROLLING YOUR EYES -- FROM

28:58.333 --> 28:58.600
DETROIT.

28:58.666 --> 28:59.266
THAT'S YOUR TAIL.

28:59.333 --> 29:10.166
>> IT IS MITEL.

29:10.233 --> 29:10.500
MY TELL.

29:10.566 --> 29:12.400
>> Bill: SHE'S CALLING FOR NO

29:12.466 --> 29:13.700
MORE POLICING OR INCARCERATION,

29:13.766 --> 29:14.400
THE CRIMINALS WILL BE ON THE

29:14.466 --> 29:16.833
HONOR SYSTEM?

29:16.900 --> 29:18.333
I THOUGHT D PHONED THE POLICE

29:18.400 --> 29:19.300
WOULD BE A TERRIBLE SLOGAN, BUT

29:19.366 --> 29:21.966
NO POLICE?

29:22.033 --> 29:26.333
THE DEMOCRATS ACHILLES' HEEL --

29:26.400 --> 29:28.066
COMMON SENSE.

29:28.133 --> 29:32.600
COMMON SENSE.

29:32.666 --> 29:33.866
YOU STRIKE PEOPLE AS HAVING NOT

29:33.933 --> 29:35.266
ANY COMMON SENSE WHEN YOU SAY

29:35.333 --> 29:37.633
THINGS -- I'M SORRY.

29:37.700 --> 29:40.266
>> I JUST WISH WE WEREN'T

29:40.333 --> 29:41.766
SPENDING SO MUCH TIME BROADLY IN

29:41.833 --> 29:44.300
THE COUNTRY TREATING RASHIDA

29:44.366 --> 29:48.433
TLAIB AND MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE

29:48.500 --> 29:50.500
AS SOME SORT OF ICONS OF WHERE

29:50.566 --> 29:51.733
THE PARTIES ARE TRYING TO BECOME

29:51.800 --> 29:52.966
ONE OF THE FACE TRYING TO BE CUM

29:53.033 --> 30:00.833
OF ARE SAYING ARE THOROUGHLY

30:00.900 --> 30:03.400
SENSELESS.

30:03.466 --> 30:06.266
>> Bill: THAT'S WHAT THE MEDIA

30:06.333 --> 30:08.566
IS TRYING TO RECOVER.

30:08.633 --> 30:10.466
>> SHE'S GOT A POINT TO.

30:10.533 --> 30:12.400
>> Bill: NO POLICING?

30:12.466 --> 30:13.433
>> TERRIBLE SLOGAN.

30:13.500 --> 30:15.866
>> Bill: THIS IS NO POLICE.

30:15.933 --> 30:19.466
>> EVEN ABOLISH THE POLICE, BAD

30:19.533 --> 30:20.200
SLOGAN.

30:20.266 --> 30:21.366
>> Bill: REALLY BAD POLICY.

30:21.433 --> 30:25.666
>> IF WE GET BEYOND THE

30:25.733 --> 30:28.866
RHETORIC, JUST SAY REIMAGINE

30:28.933 --> 30:31.433
PUBLIC SAFETY, WHAT DO WE NEED

30:31.500 --> 30:32.200
ARMED PEOPLE FOR?

30:32.266 --> 30:34.166
AND SOME THINGS FOR SURE BUT

30:34.233 --> 30:35.166
OTHER THINGS NOT ACTUALLY.

30:35.233 --> 30:36.566
>> Bill: DON'T SAY WHAT YOU

30:36.633 --> 30:38.300
DON'T MEAN, THEN YOU MEAN

30:38.366 --> 30:38.833
REFORM.

30:38.900 --> 30:42.000
THEN YOU MEAN DO IT DIFFERENTLY,

30:42.066 --> 30:44.100
DON'T SAY "ABOLISH."

30:44.166 --> 30:47.033
I DON'T GET THIS ARGUMENT.

30:47.100 --> 30:50.433
READING MY MIND, HERE'S WHAT I

30:50.500 --> 30:51.166
SAY.

30:51.233 --> 30:52.466
>> THEY SAY I'M ONLY KIDDING

30:52.533 --> 30:54.000
ABOUT THE ACTUAL ABOLISH PART

30:54.066 --> 30:55.466
PRETTY QUICKLY, IT'S NOT

30:55.533 --> 30:55.700
HEALTHY.

30:55.766 --> 30:56.166
>> Bill: LET'S GO TO

30:56.233 --> 30:58.033
AFGHANISTAN BECAUSE THIS IS

30:58.100 --> 31:00.200
DEPRESSING AND IT'S GOING TO BE

31:00.266 --> 31:01.533
DEPRESSING.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.166
>> IT'S ALL DEPRESSING.

31:03.233 --> 31:04.800
>> Bill: I'M SORRY, THE FACT

31:04.866 --> 31:07.200
THAT BIDEN DID THIS, I'VE GOT TO

31:07.266 --> 31:08.666
SAY, THIS IS OUR LONGEST WAR IF

31:08.733 --> 31:11.000
YOU DON'T COUNT THE WAR ON

31:11.066 --> 31:13.500
DRUGS.

31:13.566 --> 31:16.466
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

31:16.533 --> 31:17.766
AND I'VE HEARD WE WANTED TO GET

31:17.833 --> 31:21.600
OUT FOR THE LONGEST TIME, I

31:21.666 --> 31:23.233
REMEMBER RON PAUL USED TO SAY

31:23.300 --> 31:24.666
ABOUT IRAQ, WE CAN'T LEAVE, WE

31:24.733 --> 31:25.466
MARCHED INCOME A WE CAN MARCH

31:25.533 --> 31:27.666
RIGHT OUT.

31:27.733 --> 31:30.200
BY GOD, HE WAS RIGHT.

31:30.266 --> 31:32.700
IF WE CAN JUST CLICK OUR HEELS

31:32.766 --> 31:35.233
AND FIND OUT WE COULD ALWAYS GO

31:35.300 --> 31:35.433
HOME.

31:35.500 --> 31:38.066
AND WE CAN.

31:38.133 --> 31:40.233
FINALLY WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WITH

31:40.300 --> 31:42.033
THE BALLS TO SAY I KNOW THE

31:42.100 --> 31:42.966
OTHER SIDE OF THIS IS NOT GOING

31:43.033 --> 31:44.800
TO LOOK GOOD, IT IS GOING TO BE

31:44.866 --> 31:47.200
A BLOODBATH, THEY ARE GOING TO

31:47.266 --> 31:48.666
BE PLAYING SOCCER WITH PEOPLE'S

31:48.733 --> 31:51.233
HEADS 2 MINUTES AFTER WE ARE

31:51.300 --> 31:52.666
GONE.

31:52.733 --> 31:54.833
BUT WHAT HE SEEMS TO BE SAYING

31:54.900 --> 31:55.733
IS FOR 20 YEARS, IT DIDN'T

31:55.800 --> 31:58.000
CHANGE, WE COULD BE THERE

31:58.066 --> 31:59.666
ANOTHER FIVE OR TEN, THE SECOND

31:59.733 --> 32:00.733
WE LEAVE IT'S GOING TO GO BACK

32:00.800 --> 32:03.166
TO THAT, WHAT CAN WE DO?

32:03.233 --> 32:05.966
AS THE CALIBAN SAID YOU HAVE THE

32:06.033 --> 32:08.000
WATCHES, WE HAVE THE TIME.

32:08.066 --> 32:10.400
>> I'M WITH YOU BUT KEEP IN MIND

32:10.466 --> 32:11.966
WE CAN'T GIVE HIM CREDIT YET,

32:12.033 --> 32:14.566
HE'S MADE THE STATEMENT, WE ARE

32:14.633 --> 32:14.866
STILL THERE.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.700
>> Bill: IF HE SAID WE ARE OUT

32:16.766 --> 32:19.800
BY 9/11 AND MADE THAT BIG

32:19.866 --> 32:20.400
ANNOUNCEMENT, BANNER HEADLINES

32:20.466 --> 32:23.166
AND DIDN'T DO IT?

32:23.233 --> 32:24.600
HE'S GONNA DO IT.

32:24.666 --> 32:27.333
THEY WILL BE GONE BY 9/11.

32:27.400 --> 32:30.166
>> BIDEN HAD SAID BEFORE WHEN HE

32:30.233 --> 32:32.033
WAS VICE PRESIDENT THEY WOULD BE

32:32.100 --> 32:34.066
OUT BEFORE THE END OF THE OBAMA

32:34.133 --> 32:34.600
ADMINISTRATION, IT DIDN'T

32:34.666 --> 32:36.133
HAPPEN.

32:36.200 --> 32:38.866
HE'S HE'S THE PRESIDENT NOW,

32:38.933 --> 32:41.400
IT'S MUCH MORE HIM.

32:41.466 --> 32:42.866
TRUMP SAID THEY WANTED TO BE OUT

32:42.933 --> 32:45.333
IN THE CAN GOT KICKED TOO.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.900
20 YEARS, A TRILLION DOLLARS,

32:47.966 --> 32:50.433
2500 AMERICAN SERVICEMEN DEAD,

32:50.500 --> 32:52.266
THERE'S NO QUESTION, THIS IS NOT

32:52.333 --> 32:53.800
A POPULAR POLICY TO CONTINUE FOR

32:53.866 --> 32:54.900
THIS PRESIDENT.

32:54.966 --> 32:56.733
A 70% OF AMERICANS SAY THEY WANT

32:56.800 --> 32:57.400
OUT.

32:57.466 --> 32:58.266
IT'S NOT ALL THAT HARD FOR BIDEN

32:58.333 --> 33:02.966
TO SAY LET'S GET OUT.

33:03.033 --> 33:04.400
>> Bill: IT CERTAINLY WAS HARD

33:04.466 --> 33:06.033
FOR THE LAST TWO GUYS SO I AM

33:06.100 --> 33:08.733
GIVING HIM CREDIT.

33:08.800 --> 33:09.500
HE SEEMS TO BE DOING WHAT THEY

33:09.566 --> 33:13.333
COULDN'T DO.

33:13.400 --> 33:16.166
IT'S THAT SOME CAN COST.

33:16.233 --> 33:18.266
I ALREADY GAVE THE GYPSY

33:18.333 --> 33:19.300
$100,000, I BETTER KEEP GOING

33:19.366 --> 33:21.300
WITH IT.

33:21.366 --> 33:23.566
I'M ALREADY IN IT SO DEEP.

33:23.633 --> 33:25.433
>> IT'S VERY UNFAIR TO

33:25.500 --> 33:26.833
JOE BIDEN, PEOPLE WOULD ALWAYS

33:26.900 --> 33:28.266
QUOTE THAT FORMER DEFENSE

33:28.333 --> 33:30.000
SECRETARY BOB GATES SAYING BIDEN

33:30.066 --> 33:31.666
WAS WRONG ABOUT EVERY ISSUE FOR

33:31.733 --> 33:32.833
DECADES AND I THINK IT TURNS OUT

33:32.900 --> 33:34.566
HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT QUITE A LOT

33:34.633 --> 33:35.333
OF THEM.

33:35.400 --> 33:36.666
THE REST OF US WERE WRONG.

33:36.733 --> 33:39.366
I GIVE HIM A HUGE AMOUNT OF

33:39.433 --> 33:40.133
CREDIT.

33:40.200 --> 33:43.066
>> Bill: I THINK HE WILL BE --

33:43.133 --> 33:44.166
I'M SAYING THIS AFTER LESS THAN

33:44.233 --> 33:46.733
100 DAYS -- HE LOOKS TO ME LIKE

33:46.800 --> 33:50.333
THE PRESIDENT WE WILL COMPARE TO

33:50.400 --> 33:53.366
TRUMAN.

33:53.433 --> 33:55.100
HE SAYS I'M TOO OLD FOR THIS

33:55.166 --> 33:58.766
SHIT, WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?

33:58.833 --> 34:01.933
>> HE'S GOING TO BE REMEMBERED

34:02.000 --> 34:04.233
BORROWING ANY UNFORESEEN CRISES

34:04.300 --> 34:05.133
OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY, HE WILL

34:05.200 --> 34:08.466
BE REMEMBERED FOR THE LARGEST

34:08.533 --> 34:11.566
EXPANSION PROGRAM SINCE THE NEW

34:11.633 --> 34:12.733
DEAL BUT I WILL TELL YOU SAYING

34:12.800 --> 34:16.000
YOU ARE GOING TO GET OUT ON

34:16.066 --> 34:21.366
9/11 -- IF 9/11 IS GOING TO BE A

34:21.433 --> 34:22.666
BIG DEAL AROUND THIS

34:22.733 --> 34:24.300
ANNOUNCEMENT, THE CALIBAN --

34:24.366 --> 34:26.933
LOVE THAT.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.666
>> Bill: HE'S JUST

34:28.733 --> 34:30.833
ACKNOWLEDGING THE FACT THEY

34:30.900 --> 34:37.600
ALREADY WON, HE'S TALKING ABOUT

34:37.666 --> 34:39.000
ZOMBIE LIES, WE COINED THAT TERM

34:39.066 --> 34:40.666
AND I'VE SEEN IT IN OTHER

34:40.733 --> 34:41.433
PLACES.

34:41.500 --> 34:42.833
ONE OF THE ZOMBIE LIES, THESE

34:42.900 --> 34:45.466
ARE LIES THAT ARE PROVEN WRONG A

34:45.533 --> 34:47.733
LONG TIME AGO BUT LIVE ON.

34:47.800 --> 34:49.366
ONE OF THEM WITH THIS IS WHAT WE

34:49.433 --> 34:51.333
NEEDED TO BE THERE TO STOP THE

34:51.400 --> 34:53.200
PLOTTING FOR THE NEXT 9/11.

34:53.266 --> 34:54.700
OKAY, THEY DON'T NEED A COUNTRY

34:54.766 --> 34:56.900
TO PLOT, THEY PLOTTED THE LAST

34:56.966 --> 34:57.500
ONE IN HAMBURG, GERMANY, THEY

34:57.566 --> 34:59.533
JUST NEED A ROOM.

34:59.600 --> 35:00.300
AND THEY HAVE MOST OF

35:00.366 --> 35:02.900
AFGHANISTAN ANYWAY.

35:03.000 --> 35:03.700
ANYONE IN THE WORLD CAN PLOT THE

35:03.766 --> 35:07.233
NEXT 9/11 FROM ANYWHERE, WE

35:07.300 --> 35:08.766
DON'T HAVE TO BE IN AFGHANISTAN

35:08.833 --> 35:10.966
TO STOP THE NEXT PLOT.

35:11.033 --> 35:11.666
IT'S SO STUPID TO.

35:11.733 --> 35:13.266
>> WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEND

35:13.333 --> 35:14.800
IN SPECIAL FORCES, WE HAVE

35:14.866 --> 35:16.866
INTELLIGENCE, IF YOU'RE TRYING

35:16.933 --> 35:17.433
TO STOP TERRORISM, YOU DON'T

35:17.500 --> 35:19.800
NEED TO BE ON THE GROUND.

35:19.866 --> 35:21.533
WE ARE TRYING TO IMPROVE THE

35:21.600 --> 35:22.166
LIVES OF AFGHAN PEOPLE, WE ARE

35:22.233 --> 35:23.500
GOING TO BE THE WORLD'S LEADING

VACCINE EXPORTER IN A FEW

35:25.633 --> 35:26.333

35:26.400 --> 35:29.166

35:29.233 --> 35:30.766
WRITING 20 YEARS, IF THIS WAS A

35:30.833 --> 35:31.433
BAD RELATIONSHIP, THE KIDS WOULD

35:31.500 --> 35:35.733
BE IN COLLEGE BY NOW.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.433
>> THE KIDS WOULD BE AND ARE IN

35:38.500 --> 35:39.300

35:39.366 --> 35:39.933

35:40.000 --> 35:42.133
FOREIGNER GIVES A KID A VACCINE,

35:42.200 --> 35:43.633
YOU KNOW WHAT THE CALIBAN DOES?

35:43.700 --> 35:48.366
THEY CUT OFF THE ARM.

35:48.433 --> 35:49.366
I'M GETTING THAT FROM APOCALYPSE

35:49.433 --> 35:52.033

35:52.100 --> 35:53.333

35:53.400 --> 35:56.433
OR WITHOUT US.

35:56.500 --> 35:57.600
>> Bill: THAT'S WHY IT'S A

35:57.666 --> 35:58.400
GUTSY DECISION BECAUSE THERE IS

35:58.466 --> 36:00.900
GOING TO BE, I HAD TO SAY THAT.

36:00.966 --> 36:04.933
FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO THINK

36:05.000 --> 36:06.233

THE SIGNS THAT WERE HOLDING UP,

36:31.333 --> 36:32.733

36:32.800 --> 36:33.766
THESE ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT

36:33.833 --> 36:37.366

38:06.533 --> 38:06.900
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

38:06.966 --> 38:11.633
IT'S NICE TO KNOW THAT THE HEAD

38:15.766 --> 38:16.533
IVANKA'S WEDDING PLANNER, JUST

38:16.600 --> 38:19.866
LITTLE SIGNS OF NORMALCY.

38:19.933 --> 38:21.366
BASICALLY WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY,

38:21.433 --> 38:22.233
WE HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH

38:22.300 --> 38:24.466
CHINA THESE DAYS.

38:24.533 --> 38:26.133
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY WE ARE

38:26.200 --> 38:27.466
SAYING TO COOPERATE JUST ON THIS

38:27.533 --> 38:28.433
ONE ISSUE.

38:28.500 --> 38:29.433
EVEN IF WE CAN'T COME TO

38:29.500 --> 38:32.166
AGREEMENT ON EVERYTHING ELSE.

38:32.233 --> 38:33.566
IT'S LIKE WHEN MOM AND DAD ARE

38:33.633 --> 38:34.500
DIVORCED AND THEY HATE EACH

38:34.566 --> 38:35.266
OTHER BUT THEY MAKE A TRUCE TO

38:35.333 --> 38:38.100
GO TO THE DAUGHTER'S WEDDING?

38:38.166 --> 38:41.200
WE GOT TO DO THAT WITH CHINA.

38:41.266 --> 38:43.700
IF THE PROBLEM IS IN FOX NEWS

38:43.766 --> 38:47.133
CRAZY LAND, BIDEN IS COMPLETELY

38:47.200 --> 38:48.533
SOFT ON CHINA, HE'S TRYING

38:48.600 --> 38:50.733
HIS BEST FRIEND, THIS IS THEIR

38:50.800 --> 38:52.166
BULLSHIT THEY ARE SELLING NOW.

38:52.233 --> 38:53.133
IT'S TO A POINT WHERE THEY ARE

38:53.200 --> 38:54.466
SAYING WE SHOULD BOYCOTT THE

38:54.533 --> 38:55.633
OLYMPICS WHICH IS IN CHINA, ONE

38:55.700 --> 38:58.033
OF THE NEW ONES COMING UP, ONE

38:58.100 --> 39:00.433
OF THE DELAYED ONES THAT SHE

39:00.500 --> 39:01.666
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BOYCOTT

39:01.733 --> 39:02.000
THE OLYMPICS?

39:02.066 --> 39:04.600
>> NO, WE SHOULD BOYCOTT THE

39:04.666 --> 39:05.966
OLYMPICS BUT THEY ARE VULNERABLE

39:06.033 --> 39:07.433
ON THE OLYMPICS.

39:07.500 --> 39:09.933
BACK IN 2008 WHEN THEY HOSTED

39:10.000 --> 39:11.800
THE BEIJING OLYMPICS THE LAST

39:11.866 --> 39:13.333
TIME, THE BIG DEAL, THE

39:13.400 --> 39:14.600
COMING-OUT PARTY FOR CHINA,

39:14.666 --> 39:16.333
XI JINPING WAS IN CHARGE OF THAT

39:16.400 --> 39:17.200
PERSONALLY.

39:17.266 --> 39:19.233
HE WAS THE GUY FIGURING OUT, HE

39:19.300 --> 39:21.166
KNEW WHERE THE BATHROOMS WERE

39:21.233 --> 39:21.366
GOING.

39:21.433 --> 39:23.166
THIS WASERY PERSONAL.

39:23.233 --> 39:25.200
>> Bill: HE WAS THE

39:25.266 --> 39:26.933
MITT ROMNEY.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.566
>> HE IS DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT

39:29.633 --> 39:31.200
HE'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF

39:31.266 --> 39:32.033
POLITICAL FLACK.

39:32.100 --> 39:33.033
BEHIND THE SCENES YOU GOT

39:33.100 --> 39:34.333
CHINESE LEADERS THAT ARE SAYING

39:34.400 --> 39:36.233
WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE THIS

39:36.300 --> 39:38.166
DOESN'T GO AWRY FOR US?

39:38.233 --> 39:42.500
THAT DOES GIVE US AN OPPORTUNIT

39:42.566 --> 39:43.166
OPPORTUNITY.

39:43.233 --> 39:45.166
I THINK THE FACT THAT IT BIDEN

39:45.233 --> 39:46.566
IS TALKING TO AMERICAN ALLIES

39:46.633 --> 39:47.533
NOT ABOUT BOYCOTTING EVERYTHING

39:47.600 --> 39:49.366
BECAUSE OUR ALLIES WON'T GO

39:49.433 --> 39:49.900
ALONG WITH THIS BUT ABOUT

39:49.966 --> 39:52.766
DIPLOMATIC BOYCOTTS, PROTESTS

39:52.833 --> 39:54.733
THAT SOME OF THE ATHLETES CAN

39:54.800 --> 39:55.366
HAVE, MAKING SURE THAT WHEN WE

39:55.433 --> 39:59.766
GO IN, WE DO WE DON'T DO ALONE.

39:59.833 --> 40:01.500
I THINK THAT MATTERS.

40:01.566 --> 40:02.666
WHEN BIDEN WAS TALKING TO

40:02.733 --> 40:04.733
XI JINPING THE WAY HE PUT THIS

40:04.800 --> 40:05.266
TOGETHER HIS FIRST CALL AS

40:05.333 --> 40:08.233
PRESIDENT IT WAS -- THIS IS NOT

40:08.300 --> 40:09.566
GOING TO BE A COOPERATIVE

40:09.633 --> 40:10.033
RELATIONSHIP, IT IS A

40:10.100 --> 40:13.366
COMPETITIVE RELATIONSHIP.

40:13.433 --> 40:14.166
BUT IF YOU WANT THIS TO BE A

40:14.233 --> 40:16.433
HEALTHY COMPETITION OR AN

40:16.500 --> 40:19.066
UNHEALTHY COMPETITION, IT'S UP

40:19.133 --> 40:21.766
TO YOU.

40:21.833 --> 40:22.933
WE NEED TO SEE FROM THE CHINESE

40:23.000 --> 40:25.566
HOW THEY WANT TO PLAY THAT.

40:25.633 --> 40:27.333
SO FAR, THE MARKS HAVE NOT BEEN

40:27.400 --> 40:27.566
GOOD TO.

40:27.633 --> 40:29.666
>> Bill: BECAUSE THEY ARE

40:29.733 --> 40:30.933
WINNING.

40:31.000 --> 40:31.600
>> NO.

40:31.666 --> 40:32.366
>> Bill: NO?

40:32.433 --> 40:34.200
>> THOSE ARE FIGHTING WORDS.

40:34.266 --> 40:35.533
>> Bill: I DID A THING ABOUT

40:35.600 --> 40:37.266
THIS, IT GOT PICKED UP A LOT, I

40:37.333 --> 40:38.066
KNOW YOU DISAGREED WITH THAT BUT

40:38.133 --> 40:41.166
HERE'S TODAY IN THE PAPER, CHINA

40:41.233 --> 40:43.133
REPORTED ON FRIDAY ITS ECONOMY

40:43.200 --> 40:46.166
GREW BY 18.3% IN THE FIRST THREE

40:46.233 --> 40:49.366
MONTHS OF THE YEAR.

40:49.433 --> 40:51.333
>> IT'S A BIG NUMBER.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.400
>> Bill: THAT'S A VERY BIG

40:53.466 --> 40:53.633
NUMBER.

40:53.700 --> 40:54.200
>> Bill: IT'S COMPARED TO

40:54.266 --> 40:55.900
FIRST QUARTER LAST YEAR WHEN IT

40:55.966 --> 40:57.333
WAS SHUT DOWN.

40:57.400 --> 40:58.600
OUR NUMBERS NEXT QUARTER WILL BE

40:58.666 --> 41:00.200
INCREDIBLY GAUDY WHEN YOU LOOK

41:00.266 --> 41:01.766
AT THE SECOND SECOND QUARTER TO

41:01.833 --> 41:02.633
SECOND QUARTER, IT'S UNIQUE,

41:02.700 --> 41:04.933
IT'S A PANDEMIC.

41:05.000 --> 41:05.966
>> Bill: I UNDERSTAND.

41:06.033 --> 41:08.433
>> THERE ARE BIGGER NUMBERS.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.700
>> Bill: MY POINT ABOUT WHEN

41:10.766 --> 41:12.933
WE WERE A SILLY PEOPLE AS WE

41:13.000 --> 41:15.100
CAN'T SEEM TO DO ANYTHING

41:15.166 --> 41:15.400
ANYMORE.

41:15.466 --> 41:18.666
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT REFORMING

41:18.733 --> 41:18.966
THE POLICE.

41:19.033 --> 41:20.800
CAN WE ACTUALLY DO IT?

41:20.866 --> 41:23.533
WE HAVE HAD SOME GOOD NEWS WITH

41:23.600 --> 41:25.466
BIDEN IN OFFICE BUT WILL WE BE

41:25.533 --> 41:28.033
ABLE TO BUILD RAIL LINES FOR

LESS THAN THIS EXTRAORDINARY

41:35.366 --> 41:36.500
DRAFT PRICE, WILL WE BE ABLE TO

41:36.566 --> 41:38.766
FIX THE POT HOLES, THE MAIL.

I USED TO DEFEND THE

41:40.433 --> 41:42.066
POST OFFICE, NOW, I'M SORRY

41:42.133 --> 41:43.733
GUYS, I CAN'T TRUST YOU.

41:43.800 --> 41:47.600
NOTHING GETS THERE.

41:47.666 --> 41:50.333
WILL WE BE ABLE TO REOPEN

41:50.400 --> 41:51.633
SCHOOLS?

41:51.700 --> 41:53.933
WE DON'T SEEM LIKE WE ARE THE

41:54.000 --> 41:55.700
COUNTRY THAT HAS THE EYE OF THE

41:55.766 --> 41:57.966
TIGER.

41:58.033 --> 42:00.600
>> YOU SAID BIDEN IS TRUMAN, YOU

42:00.666 --> 42:02.000
CAN'T SAY BIDEN'S TREATMENT AT

42:02.066 --> 42:02.733
THE SAME TIME AND SAY WE CAN'T

42:02.800 --> 42:02.933
DO IT.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.500
>> GIVE JOE A LITTLE BIT OF A

42:06.566 --> 42:07.766
CHANCE HERE.

42:12.966 --> 42:14.533
ARGUMENT, EVEN IF HE WAS, ONE

42:14.600 --> 42:15.233
MAN CAN CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE

42:15.300 --> 42:17.933
WHOLE COUNTRY.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.866
>> WE HAVE ALL THOSE OTHER NICE

PEOPLE HANGING AROUND IN

42:20.433 --> 42:21.566
WASHINGTON NOW.

42:21.633 --> 42:27.000
I'M NOT KIDDING.

42:27.066 --> 42:29.200
>> Bill: THINGS ARE DEFINITELY

42:29.266 --> 42:31.166
BETTER.

42:31.233 --> 42:32.566
WHENEVER WE SAY WE ARE GOING TO

42:32.633 --> 42:35.333
DO SOMETHING BIG IT'S LIKE BY

42:35.400 --> 42:39.200
2035 IT'S LIKE OVER FUCKS SAKE.

42:39.266 --> 42:41.933
>> THIS IS BEEN THE WORST CRISIS

42:42.000 --> 42:43.666
IN OUR LIFETIMES NOT JUST THE

42:43.733 --> 42:45.100
U.S., BUT GLOBALLY.

42:45.166 --> 42:45.900
WE'VE DONE A LOT OF THINGS WRONG

42:45.966 --> 42:47.500
WITH THE ECONOMIC RESPONSE

DOMESTICALLY OF THE

42:53.933 --> 42:55.200
THE MOST EFFECTIVE RESPONSE OF

42:55.266 --> 42:57.200
ANY MAJOR ECONOMY IN THE WORLD.

42:57.266 --> 42:58.600
VACCINES, BY FAR THE BEST AND

42:58.666 --> 43:00.366
MOST EFFECTIVE RESPONSE OF ANY

43:00.433 --> 43:01.633
COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD, THE

43:01.700 --> 43:02.966
CHINESE HAVE THE VACCINES AHEAD

43:03.033 --> 43:04.966
OF THE CDC IN CHINA SAYS THEY

43:05.033 --> 43:06.233
DON'T REALLY WORK VERY WELL.

43:06.300 --> 43:08.300
>> Bill: BUT THEY WERE BACK TO

43:08.366 --> 43:09.933
PARTYING WHEN WE WERE STILL

43:10.000 --> 43:10.900
LOCKED DOWN.

43:10.966 --> 43:12.800
>> THAT'S GOOD, THEY WILL BE

43:12.866 --> 43:13.433
DISTRACTED BY THEIR PARTIES AND

43:13.500 --> 43:16.266
WILL WIN.

43:16.333 --> 43:17.833
>> WERE PEOPLE WANT TO INVEST,

43:17.900 --> 43:19.933
THEY ARE COMING TO THE U.S.

43:26.900 --> 43:28.900
THAT'S SIGNIFICANT OR JUST A

43:28.966 --> 43:30.633
COINCIDENCE, IT'S ONLY

THOSE ULTRA-REALISTIC SEX

DON'T SPIN ME WHEN IT COMES TO

49:18.566 --> 49:18.966
MY HEALTH.

49:19.033 --> 49:19.666
OVER THE PAST YEAR, THE COVID

49:19.733 --> 49:20.566
PANDEMIC HAS PROMPTED THE

49:20.633 --> 49:21.400
MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT, THE MEDIA

49:21.466 --> 49:22.133
AND GOVERNMENT TO TAKE A "SCARED

49:22.200 --> 49:25.533
STRAIGHT" APPROACH TO GETTING

49:25.600 --> 49:26.700
THE PUBLIC TO COMPLY WITH THEIR

SCHOOL: "GIVE IT TO ME STRAIGHT,

49:29.566 --> 49:33.333
DOC."

49:33.400 --> 49:34.366
BECAUSE IN THE LONG RUN, THAT

49:34.433 --> 49:35.433
ALWAYS WORKS BETTER THAN "YOU

49:35.500 --> 49:44.000
CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH."

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

[LAUGHTER]

49:57.433 --> 49:59.333

HIGHER THE RATINGS.

50:05.666 --> 50:07.500
RESEARCHERS AT DARTMOUTH BUILT A

50:07.566 --> 50:09.500
DATABASE RECENTLY, MONITORING

50:09.566 --> 50:11.600
THE COVID COVERAGE OF THE MAJOR

50:11.666 --> 50:14.100
NEWS OUTLETS ACROSS THE WORLD

50:14.166 --> 50:15.333
AND FOUND THAT WHILE OTHER

50:15.400 --> 50:16.700
COUNTRIES MIXED THE GOOD NEWS IN

50:16.766 --> 50:18.500
WITH THE BAD, THE U.S. NATIONAL

50:18.566 --> 50:21.033
MEDIA REPORTED ALMOST 90% BAD

50:21.100 --> 50:22.066
NEWS.

50:22.133 --> 50:27.166
EVEN AS THINGS WERE GETTING

50:27.233 --> 50:27.766
BETTER, THE REPORTING REMAINED

50:27.833 --> 50:28.033
NEGATIVE.

50:28.100 --> 50:28.866
AND POLITICIANS?

50:28.933 --> 50:29.866
THEY LIE BECAUSE IT'S THEIR

50:29.933 --> 50:31.966
NATURE TO COVER THEIR ASS SO

50:32.033 --> 50:34.933
THEY DON'T GET BLAMED IF THINGS

50:35.000 --> 50:35.700
GO BADLY.

50:35.766 --> 50:40.700
AND ALSO TO KEEP IN PRACTICE.

[LAUGHTER]

50:41.033 --> 50:41.233

50:43.866 --> 50:47.300
AGENDA TO SPIN US, YOU WIND UP

50:47.366 --> 50:48.633
WITH A BADLY MISINFORMED

50:48.700 --> 50:49.500
POPULATION, INCLUDING ON THE

50:49.566 --> 50:51.166
LEFT.

50:51.233 --> 50:53.066
LIBERALS OFTEN MOCK THE

50:53.133 --> 50:55.700
REPUBLICAN MISINFORMATION

50:55.766 --> 50:57.066
BUBBLE, WHICH OF COURSE, IS VERY

50:57.133 --> 50:58.033
REAL.

50:58.100 --> 50:59.500
ASK ANYONE WHO WORKS AT

50:59.566 --> 51:02.433
HILLARY'S PIZZA PARLOR.

51:02.500 --> 51:03.900
AND WE DO KNOW CONSERVATIVES

51:03.966 --> 51:05.300
HAVE SOME LOOPY IDEAS ABOUT

51:05.366 --> 51:07.300
COVID, LIKE THE THIRD OF

51:07.366 --> 51:08.933
REPUBLICANS WHO BELIEVE IT

51:09.000 --> 51:10.433
COULDN'T BE SPREAD BY SOMEONE

51:10.500 --> 51:12.233
SHOWING NO SYMPTOMS.

51:12.300 --> 51:14.066
BUT WHAT ABOUT LIBERALS - YOU

51:14.133 --> 51:15.733
KNOW, THE HIGH INFORMATION,

BY-THE-SCIENCE PEOPLE?

51:18.100 --> 51:19.066
IN A RECENT GALLUP SURVEY

51:19.133 --> 51:21.166
DEMOCRATS DID MUCH WORSE THAN

51:25.666 --> 51:26.800
THAT SOMEONE WHO GETS COVID WILL

51:26.866 --> 51:32.000

51:32.066 --> 51:33.866
THE ANSWER IS BETWEEN ONE AND

51:33.933 --> 51:35.033
FIVE PERCENT BUT 41% OF

51:35.100 --> 51:35.966
DEMOCRATS THOUGHT IT WAS OVER

CHANGE DENIAL, SHOULDN'T LIBERAL

52:09.300 --> 52:10.766
MEDIA HAVE TO ANSWER FOR: HOW

52:10.833 --> 52:13.133
DID YOUR AUDIENCE WIND UP

52:13.200 --> 52:15.000
BELIEVING SUCH A BUNCH OF CRAP

ABOUT COVID?

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

52:25.266 --> 52:26.900

52:28.300 --> 52:30.566
PUTTING PICTURES OF THE BEACH ON

52:30.633 --> 52:32.200
STORIES ABOUT COVID EVEN THOUGH

52:32.266 --> 52:33.433
IT'S LOOKING INCREASINGLY LIKE

52:33.500 --> 52:34.900
THE BEACH IS THE BEST PLACE TO

52:34.966 --> 52:37.466
AVOID IT.

52:37.533 --> 52:39.000
SUNLIGHT IS THE BEST

52:39.066 --> 52:40.133
DISINFECTANT AND VITAMIN D IS

52:40.200 --> 52:41.466
THE KEY TO A ROBUST IMMUNE

SYSTEM.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.366
TEXAS LIFTED ITS COVID

52:45.433 --> 52:46.666

52:46.733 --> 52:48.533
INFECTION RATES WENT DOWN, IN

52:48.600 --> 52:49.800
PART BECAUSE OF PEOPLE GETTING

52:49.866 --> 52:51.933
OUTSIDE TO LET THE SUN AND WIND

52:52.000 --> 52:59.966
DO THEIR THING.

53:00.500 --> 53:03.400
BUT TO MANY LIBERALS, THAT CAN'T

53:03.466 --> 53:05.066
BE RIGHT, BECAUSE TEXAS AND

53:05.133 --> 53:06.533
BEACH-LOVING FLORIDA HAVE

53:06.600 --> 53:08.900
REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS.

53:08.966 --> 53:12.200
BUT LIFE IS COMPLICATED.

53:12.266 --> 53:13.100

53:35.033 --> 53:36.333

53:38.800 --> 53:40.466

NOTHING, OUR SIDE HAS TO SAY

54:17.133 --> 54:18.900
IT'S EVERYTHING.

54:18.966 --> 54:19.900
TRUMP SAID IT WOULD GO AWAY

54:19.966 --> 54:22.466
"LIKE A MIRACLE" AND WE SAID IT

54:22.533 --> 54:24.700
WAS WORLD WAR Z.

54:24.766 --> 54:26.766
TRUMP SAID WE SHOULD INGEST

54:30.266 --> 54:32.966
LAUGHED, OF COURSE - AND THEN IT

LITERALLY DRENCHING THE FRUIT IN

54:39.800 --> 54:41.733

54:41.800 --> 54:42.800
THAT ALL THAT PARANOIA ABOUT

54:42.866 --> 54:45.166
