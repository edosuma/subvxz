00:03.133 --> 00:03.433
- Previously

00:03.433 --> 00:04.100
- Previously
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

00:05.400 --> 00:07.000
- I want to take you guys
to Solvang.

00:07.033 --> 00:09.000
- I love Solvang.
- So we'll fuel the J.

00:09.033 --> 00:10.367
It's, like, a 20-minute flight.

00:10.400 --> 00:11.767
You can talk to me
about everything.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.500
- Yeah.
- When you do it with Stassi

00:13.533 --> 00:15.333
or Katie, they feel
a bit overwhelmed.

00:15.367 --> 00:17.233
- I shouldn't try
so hard sometimes.

00:17.266 --> 00:19.367
- Are you helping
all your family out?

00:19.400 --> 00:23.467
- Yes. I gave him 5 grand.
My treat, everybody.

00:23.500 --> 00:27.100
all: Thank you.
- Tomorrow, we are gonna go

00:27.133 --> 00:29.133
look
at the engagement party venue

00:29.166 --> 00:30.500
called Inn of the Seventh Ray.

00:30.533 --> 00:33.033
- Oh, my God.
- Like, in my wildest dreams,

00:33.066 --> 00:35.033
I couldn't come up
with something this pretty.

00:35.066 --> 00:38.266
- Cheers, everybody!

I've got a bit of a hangover.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.567
I don't know how--
- Right? I was just about

01:20.600 --> 01:22.200
to say, "How you feeling?"
- I didn't even drink

01:22.233 --> 01:24.066
that much. Those bloody
cocktails they made.

01:24.100 --> 01:25.533
I literally had two.

01:29.600 --> 01:33.233
- Are you smashed?
- No. Not at all.

01:33.266 --> 01:35.533
I don't think I've had
a hangover this bad since,

01:35.567 --> 01:40.567
like, 1985 when we used
to have a house in Ibiza.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.500
Also, I got pregnant
that night.

01:47.467 --> 01:49.433
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hey.

01:49.467 --> 01:52.300
- Hi. I was so badly
behaved last night.

01:52.333 --> 01:54.200
- You were amazing.
- You were so cute, Lisa.

01:54.233 --> 01:55.633
- And we said
it was well-earned.

01:55.667 --> 01:58.066
- It had so much momentum.
It just kept going

01:58.100 --> 01:59.600
and going and going.

01:59.633 --> 02:02.233
We killed it.
Client was happy. Stayed late.

02:02.266 --> 02:06.066
- We were busting our asses.
- Lisa got drunk.

02:06.100 --> 02:08.066
We never ran out of cocktails.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.367
- I think we both
get gold stars.

02:10.400 --> 02:13.300
- It was a total success.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.266
- Let's just take
a breath, right?

02:15.300 --> 02:17.066
We still didn't have gas.

02:17.100 --> 02:19.600
That's why we had to cook
the food at Pump, but then,

02:19.633 --> 02:22.333
once we've got the gas,
then we can train the staff.

02:22.367 --> 02:23.600
- Okay.
- Yeah.

02:23.633 --> 02:25.600
- We've got work to do
in the kitchen.

02:25.633 --> 02:28.333
Work to do in the garden.
The lighting and everything.

02:28.367 --> 02:30.300
You've got to do
more food tasting.

02:30.333 --> 02:33.600
Remember, all those people
were excited by the visuals,

02:33.633 --> 02:35.200
and they weren't
paying to be there,

02:35.233 --> 02:36.533
and it's a very
different situation.

02:36.567 --> 02:38.100
- You're right.
- These guys feel like

02:38.133 --> 02:39.467
they've crossed
the finish line,

02:39.500 --> 02:42.433
but I feel like I'm still
on the starting block.

02:42.467 --> 02:44.667
Well, this is where
the hard work begins.

02:50.266 --> 02:51.467
- Hi.
- Hi, Booboo.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.467
- Hi, hi, hi.
- How are you?

02:54.500 --> 02:56.266
- Hi.

02:56.300 --> 02:59.533
- It's so bright.
- Oh, my God.

02:59.567 --> 03:03.166
Last night.
I mean I just got drunk.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.166
- Are you hungover?
- Mm-hmm.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.533
- Was it fun though?
- It was fun. Where'd you go?

03:08.567 --> 03:11.300
- Lisa didn't want me there,
and I'm like...

03:11.333 --> 03:13.166
- Was there a reason for that?
- "Kay."

03:13.200 --> 03:14.700
- Literally no clue.

03:14.734 --> 03:16.433
Whether Lisa likes it or not,

03:16.467 --> 03:18.600
I'm a part of the Sur family,

03:18.633 --> 03:20.600
and it would be a lot easier
for both of us

03:20.633 --> 03:22.700
if she just accepted it.

03:22.734 --> 03:25.433
- Well, you weren't at Sur
the other night,

03:25.467 --> 03:27.533
but I want
to invite you to Solvang.

03:27.567 --> 03:30.333
I don't know
if you've been there before.

03:30.367 --> 03:31.767
It's like Danish wine country.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.533
- Yes. I need to get
the (BLEEP) out of my house.

03:34.567 --> 03:36.266
- Your travel anxiety
won't kick in if--

03:36.300 --> 03:37.600
- No, not at all.
- No.

03:37.633 --> 03:38.700
We're not taking you
too far, babe.

03:38.734 --> 03:40.333
- Yeah.

03:40.367 --> 03:42.600
- Kristen is a nightmare
to travel with.

03:42.633 --> 03:45.567
Last year in Mexico,
she was an absolute sh-- show.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.367
- Are you ----ing--
- Kristen!

03:48.400 --> 03:50.166
- Stop.
- ----ing Doute.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.533
Look at what you just
did to me.

03:51.567 --> 03:53.166
- What are you doing?
- Are you ----ing kidding

03:53.200 --> 03:54.567
me, Kristen?
This trip is for people

03:54.600 --> 03:56.667
that were there for me
when my dad passed,

03:56.700 --> 03:59.266
and she was one of them,
but she for damn sure

03:59.300 --> 04:01.433
will not be rooming with me.
- I want a girls' trip

04:01.467 --> 04:03.567
where I don't have to go
back to, like, my hotel room

04:03.600 --> 04:05.667
with Carter and fight with him
until, like 5:00 a.m.,

04:05.700 --> 04:07.300
and then, like,
wake up the next morning,

04:07.333 --> 04:08.734
and pretend everything's okay.

04:08.767 --> 04:11.000
- Wait. Hold on. Is it okay?
- Yeah, are you okay?

04:11.033 --> 04:12.734
- You don't have
to talk about it.

04:12.767 --> 04:14.500
- It's not sh---y.
It's, like, I don't what

04:14.533 --> 04:17.000
it--I don't ----ing know.
- I'm sorry, boo.

04:17.033 --> 04:20.433
- Carter and I fight a lot
over dumb sh--.

04:20.467 --> 04:22.400
If you want me to empty
the dishwasher,

04:22.433 --> 04:24.200
I feel like you say,
"Babe, did you empty

04:24.233 --> 04:25.633
the ----ing dishwasher?"

04:25.667 --> 04:27.300
That is when
I immediately am like--

04:27.333 --> 04:28.767
- Okay. When we just took
the dogs for a walk,

04:29.000 --> 04:30.567
before you left, and you come
up: "Take the dogs out again?"

04:30.600 --> 04:32.667
I'm like,
"They've been asleep."

04:32.700 --> 04:34.533
"You need to do this,
and you need to do that."

04:34.567 --> 04:36.300
- You have a household with
a girlfriend and two dogs.

04:36.333 --> 04:37.767
- I know that. And I'm sitting
here helping you take care

04:38.000 --> 04:39.667
of them, but you're
overprotective--

04:39.700 --> 04:41.300
- We share responsibility.
- You got to calm down on it.

04:41.333 --> 04:42.700
You're being overbearing.

04:42.734 --> 04:44.700
- I think it's healthy
to disagree,

04:44.734 --> 04:46.734
but not seven days a week.

04:46.767 --> 04:49.400
- I'm sorry boo.
- It's just, like, a ----ing

04:49.433 --> 04:53.000
communication thing.
- Oh, thank you.

04:53.033 --> 04:55.367
- Did you want a rosé too?
- I'm actually okay,

04:55.400 --> 04:56.734
but do you think
someone will drink it,

04:56.767 --> 04:58.667
at the table if he leaves that?
- Probably.

04:58.700 --> 05:03.300
- A couple months ago
Randall and I got sloshed,

05:03.333 --> 05:06.700
and apparently I was running
around naked screaming

05:06.734 --> 05:08.400
at the top of my lungs,

05:08.433 --> 05:11.000
and I broke
a hurricane-proof window.

05:11.033 --> 05:13.233
I just wanted to make sure
everyone's gonna have fun

05:13.266 --> 05:15.633
on the girls' trip.
Like, let us just sip wine

05:15.667 --> 05:17.300
in Danish wine country.
- I was gonna say.

05:17.333 --> 05:19.433
- Do you sip wine?
- No, but I'll sniff it.

05:19.467 --> 05:22.333
So Rand and I made a pact
that we should probably

05:22.367 --> 05:23.734
stop drinking,
but that doesn't mean

05:23.767 --> 05:26.200
I can't get my bitches drunk.

05:26.233 --> 05:29.467
- Girls' trip.

05:40.100 --> 05:43.667
- This is beautiful.

05:43.700 --> 05:47.367
- This place is pretty AF.
- Oh, my gosh.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.467
Thank you guys for coming.
- Hi, Brittany.

05:49.500 --> 05:50.667
I'm Holly.
- Nice to meet you.

05:50.700 --> 05:53.000
- This is my fiancé, Jax.
- Hi. Jax.

05:53.033 --> 05:54.500
- Hi, Jax. How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

05:54.533 --> 05:56.367
- Have you been here before?
- No.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.300
- No?
- Just looked online. Yeah.

05:58.333 --> 06:00.700
- Katie actually told me
to come and look at this place,

06:00.734 --> 06:02.700
and Stassi's good
at asking questions.

06:05.266 --> 06:07.367
I am planning
my engagement party,

06:07.400 --> 06:08.633
and I really want
something that has, like,

06:08.667 --> 06:11.433
this whimsical,
enchanted forest feel.

06:11.467 --> 06:15.667
I love all the fairy-tale
stuff. Obsessed with fairies.

06:15.700 --> 06:17.500
I thought they were real
when I was growing up.

06:17.533 --> 06:20.700
I was a true believer.

06:20.734 --> 06:22.667
- You can do whatever you want
to the space.

06:22.700 --> 06:24.300
If you want to do
a welcome sign,

06:24.333 --> 06:25.700
or if you want
to do photos up here.

06:25.734 --> 06:27.467
- Fun. I've been buying
decorations off Amazon

06:27.500 --> 06:30.367
for, like, the past month.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.400
- So your guests will enter
down these stairs.

06:32.433 --> 06:36.433
- Oh, my gosh.
- This is freaking magical.

06:36.467 --> 06:38.467
- I know.
- This is exactly

06:38.500 --> 06:40.500
the kind of look I would want.
I'm picturing it at night,

06:40.533 --> 06:42.400
with all the lights.
- And at night, honestly,

06:42.433 --> 06:44.400
the entire place is covered
with twinkle lights.

06:44.433 --> 06:46.700
- This looks really expensive.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.266
- What did you guys envision
for your party? Any idea?

06:51.300 --> 06:52.633
- Did you want to do a dinner,
or did you want to kind

06:52.667 --> 06:54.767
of do it like a table
of just finger food?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.734
- Like, if you're gonna have it

06:56.767 --> 06:58.433
at night, it's gonna be
around dinnertime,

06:58.467 --> 07:00.000
so you're gonna want to have,
like, some food.

07:00.033 --> 07:01.700
- Yeah.
- Brittany is seeing

07:01.734 --> 07:04.667
all the possibilities, and all
I'm seeing is dollar signs,

07:04.700 --> 07:07.000
dollar signs.
- ...cake-cutting fee.

07:07.033 --> 07:08.700
Photo booth.
Parking's all valet.

07:08.734 --> 07:10.033
- Dollar signs. Dollar signs.

07:10.066 --> 07:11.567
- Filet mignon, $50 a person.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.133
- That sounds really expensive.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.367
- Unlimited beer, wine,
champagne. $30 a person.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.100
With soju it's another
$7 a person.

07:17.133 --> 07:18.633
- Beer and wine is fine.

07:18.667 --> 07:21.033
- You guys should have
a specialty soju shot.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.700
- You're welcome
to add on ours.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.433
- We're not even
at the wedding yet.

07:24.467 --> 07:27.400
- The wedding's gonna
be way more.

07:27.433 --> 07:29.033
- Roughly...?
- So here.

07:29.066 --> 07:30.333
- How much is this gonna cost?

07:30.367 --> 07:33.633
- $14,205.

07:33.667 --> 07:35.700
- These things are expensive,
you guys.

07:35.734 --> 07:39.600
- Yep. They are, but he knows
I want it.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.467
- Jax looks like he's sh---ing
his pants.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.100
I mean he's always been cheap.

07:43.133 --> 07:45.033
Like, he stole sunglasses
for Brittany.

07:45.066 --> 07:47.667
He stole a wallet for me.
He used to steal sandwiches

07:47.700 --> 07:49.467
all the time from the gas
station 'cause he didn't want

07:49.500 --> 07:51.166
to buy his own lunch.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.533
Actually, no. I don't know
if that's just, like, cheap

07:53.567 --> 07:56.000
or if that's, like,
maybe he's a klepto.

07:56.033 --> 07:58.066
- Everybody was asking who was
gonna get engaged next,

07:58.100 --> 07:59.600
and I kept saying
Stassi and Beau.

07:59.633 --> 08:01.467
- Oh, yeah. For sure.
- Now I wanna be next.

08:01.500 --> 08:04.667
- We can all start
having babies together.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.467
- I told her that I
want her to wait.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.000
I need you guys to just, like,
wait a little bit,

08:08.033 --> 08:09.433
so we can all be pregnant
at the same time.

08:09.467 --> 08:11.133
- I'm getting older.
I'm, like--

08:11.166 --> 08:13.033
things that come with age,
I'm really starting to feel.

08:13.066 --> 08:14.734
- Well, and taking care
of a kid...

08:14.767 --> 08:16.400
- And he's already 40, right?
- I know. I'm gonna be 40.

08:16.433 --> 08:18.133
I mean I told her
we're starting right away.

08:18.166 --> 08:19.667
- But you have to also...
- Stay sane.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.367
- Get your relationship
ready for it.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.066
- Yeah. Well, we're going
to therapy tomorrow.

08:23.100 --> 08:24.567
- That's great.
- Technically,

08:24.600 --> 08:26.166
if we are getting married
in the Catholic church,

08:26.200 --> 08:27.767
you have to go
to therapy a year ahead.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.700
If you want to get married
in the Catholic church,

08:29.734 --> 08:31.433
you have to get
marriage counseling.

08:31.467 --> 08:32.600
It's always been like that.

08:32.633 --> 08:34.133
The Pope made that rule
I guess.

08:34.166 --> 08:35.767
I don't know.
It's just a rule.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.600
- And, like, I think, like,
a couple's ther--like,

08:37.633 --> 08:39.567
I've never been to therapy,
but I feel like

08:39.600 --> 08:41.667
they can give you, like, advice
and, like, things that can...

08:41.700 --> 08:43.633
- Tools.
- Help us. Yeah. Tools. Hi.

08:43.667 --> 08:46.467
- How are we doing? Good.
So you just go ahead,

08:46.500 --> 08:49.667
and sign there for me.
- Yay. I'm so excited.

08:49.700 --> 08:51.734
- Well, thank you guys.
Congratulations.

08:51.767 --> 08:53.400
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much for coming.

08:53.433 --> 08:54.734
- Thank you.
- All right. Bye, guys.

08:54.767 --> 08:56.200
- We're so excited. Thank you.
- Awesome.

08:56.233 --> 08:58.100
- Katie, such a good idea.
Thank you.

08:58.133 --> 09:01.000
- I'm never gonna be able
to quit Sur.

09:01.033 --> 09:03.233
- Coming up.
- We on the PJ, bitches,

09:03.266 --> 09:05.133
and none of us paid for it!

09:05.166 --> 09:07.000
- Whoo!
- The WiFi password is

09:07.033 --> 09:08.767
"sucks if you're not on a PJ."

09:09.000 --> 09:11.433
I belong here.

09:16.667 --> 09:17.200
- ♪ Wake up ♪

09:26.066 --> 09:28.033
- Are you guys doing okay?

09:35.300 --> 09:36.767
- Brittany.
- Hi, Peter.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.533
- How you doing?
- Good. How you doing, honey?

09:38.567 --> 09:41.600
- Good, good.
- Where you want me?

09:41.633 --> 09:43.300
- Uh, pink room actually.
- Yes.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.700
- Yes. Pink room.
- That's my favorite.

09:44.734 --> 09:46.700
- I know it is. All right.

09:49.133 --> 09:51.567
- I just need to grab
some menus to take back there.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.266
- Hi, babe.
- Hi.

09:53.300 --> 09:55.367
- Hi, ladies. How are we doing?
- Good.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.667
- Good?
- I'd love a cup of tea.

09:57.700 --> 09:59.700
- All right.
- Well, actually I'd love

09:59.734 --> 10:01.600
one of those cocktails,
but I won't.

10:01.633 --> 10:03.600
- I'll get you a cup of tea.

10:03.633 --> 10:05.667
- Sorry. Excuse me.

10:05.700 --> 10:07.667
Hello.
- Hey, boo.

10:07.700 --> 10:10.033
- Hi.
How's it going?

10:10.066 --> 10:13.200
- Good. I'm just stuffing
these menu--I'm, like,

10:13.233 --> 10:14.767
so OCD it's driving me nuts.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.700
- Hi, sexy.
- Can I please be demoted,

10:17.734 --> 10:19.266
so I can show up to work in--
- I know.

10:19.300 --> 10:21.166
- Not that I would look
this good in that.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.300
- No.
It's not that fun sometimes.

10:23.333 --> 10:25.400
- I went and looked at my
wedding venue--or not

10:25.433 --> 10:27.133
wedding venue.
Engagement party venue today.

10:27.166 --> 10:29.266
- Ooh. Oh, my gosh.
I just got chills.

10:29.300 --> 10:30.700
- I know.
- Tell me everything.

10:30.734 --> 10:33.166
- It's at the Inn
of the Seventh Ray.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.700
It, like, looks like
a fairy-tale book.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.233
- Oh, my God.
- I love that.

10:36.266 --> 10:38.567
Britt, epic.
- Three Jack Daniels.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.266
- Three shooters? Okay.
I can do that.

10:41.300 --> 10:43.166
- Are you ready, baby?

10:43.200 --> 10:46.166
Come on. I'm excited
for this guys' night.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.066
- I'm glad actually we're doing
a little staycation,

10:48.100 --> 10:50.200
because I got to be close
to TomTom, in case

10:50.233 --> 10:52.233
any sh-- hits the fan,
you know?

10:52.266 --> 10:55.600
Since the girls are gone,
guys' night is on.

10:55.633 --> 10:59.300
- How many rooms did you get?
- Just one.

10:59.333 --> 11:02.400
It's a king suite.
There's a nice little daybed.

11:02.433 --> 11:05.400
- Can I bring anything?
Pool toys? Dildos?

11:05.433 --> 11:08.066
- Probably some dildos.
- Strippers? Hookers?

11:08.100 --> 11:10.066
- No. None of that.

11:10.100 --> 11:12.300
I would assume that being this
is Jaxon's first guys' night

11:12.333 --> 11:14.400
since he cheated,
he wouldn't do anything

11:14.433 --> 11:17.033
remotely close
to pissing off Brittany.

11:17.066 --> 11:18.433
- Can you imagine me
FaceTiming Brittany,

11:18.467 --> 11:21.000
and there's hookers
in our room?

11:21.033 --> 11:23.367
- I would assume.

11:25.433 --> 11:27.166
- I cannot wait
for this girls' trip.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.066
- Is Lisa here tonight?
- Lisa's here tonight,

11:29.100 --> 11:31.700
and I think--I mean, I haven't
asked her for time off yet.

11:31.734 --> 11:34.367
Has anybody?

11:34.400 --> 11:36.066
All right.
- We'll see what she says.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.667
-  Nervous.

11:37.700 --> 11:40.266
- Are you nervous too?
Wow. Why do we get nervous?

11:40.300 --> 11:42.100
- I know.

11:43.266 --> 11:45.633
- Hi, Lisa.

11:45.667 --> 11:48.000
- Yes? You need something
or you want something.

11:48.033 --> 11:49.367
- Yes.
- I can see that look

11:49.400 --> 11:50.700
on your face.
- I am hoping that I can take

11:50.734 --> 11:53.633
the girls to Solvang,

11:53.667 --> 11:55.734
so we're asking
if we can have it off.

11:55.767 --> 11:58.100
- And we already got our shifts
covered, if you approve it.

11:58.133 --> 12:00.100
- Everything's covered.
- When are you going?

12:00.133 --> 12:03.166
- Wednesday morning,
and we'll be back Friday.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.100
- Well, then you need to be
back Friday evening...

12:05.133 --> 12:06.400
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- 'Cause it's very busy.

12:06.433 --> 12:07.767
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll be back, for sure.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.700
- Okay. 100% promise.
- Promise.

12:09.734 --> 12:11.633
- We have a private jet, so
we can leave whenever we want.

12:11.667 --> 12:13.333
- Oh, of course you do.

12:13.367 --> 12:16.133
Randall must be involved
in this little equation then.

12:16.166 --> 12:18.300
- Yeah. He's a good guy.

12:18.333 --> 12:20.633
- I think Lala is being
a little cavalier

12:20.667 --> 12:23.066
with her job
and her position here.

12:23.100 --> 12:25.367
I feel like I'm almost working
for Lala, you know,

12:25.400 --> 12:27.266
so she can take a private jet.

12:27.300 --> 12:29.400
She needs to kind of
come back down to Earth,

12:29.433 --> 12:31.400
if she's gonna be
part of this situation.

12:31.433 --> 12:33.066
- So we're good?
- Right.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.333
- Okay.
- I got to go, okay?

12:34.367 --> 12:35.734
I'm late.
- Thanks, Lisa.

12:35.767 --> 12:37.100
- All right.
Well, we're gonna go.

12:37.133 --> 12:39.300
Girls' night.
- Yeah.

12:47.734 --> 12:51.400
- Hi.
- Hi. She is down there.

12:51.433 --> 12:53.066
both: Hi.
- How are you?

12:53.100 --> 12:54.300
- I'm good. How are you?
- Good to see you.

12:54.333 --> 12:56.000
- Come on in.
How have you been?

12:56.033 --> 12:57.700
- Well, good.
How have you been?

12:57.734 --> 12:59.300
- Good. Thank you.

12:59.333 --> 13:00.767
- I am going to therapy,
because you know,

13:01.000 --> 13:02.433
Lisa thinks it's gonna be
a good idea

13:02.467 --> 13:04.200
for me
to start talking to somebody.

13:04.233 --> 13:07.300
- You need to be in
some kind of therapy.

13:07.333 --> 13:09.300
- I promise you I will.

13:09.333 --> 13:11.233
In order for me
to get back into Sur,

13:11.266 --> 13:13.000
I need to show
Lisa that I really want this,

13:13.033 --> 13:14.300
to show her that I'm trying.

13:14.333 --> 13:16.500
I'm kind of dealing with
something right now

13:16.533 --> 13:18.200
with my parents.

13:18.233 --> 13:20.467
My mum called me saying like,
"Oh, your dad, like,

13:20.500 --> 13:23.100
owes me this much,
and blah, blah, blah."

13:23.133 --> 13:25.133
Puts it on me pretty much.

13:25.166 --> 13:27.100
My dad tells me
he is looking for a job,

13:27.133 --> 13:30.133
but there is still
a responsibility, you know.

13:30.166 --> 13:32.033
Like the car insurance and sh--
like that,

13:32.066 --> 13:33.333
and it's not for much.

13:33.367 --> 13:35.400
200 here or there, which
I'm sending to my mum

13:35.433 --> 13:37.400
every other day, at this point.

13:37.433 --> 13:39.033
- So you're really
supporting her.

13:39.066 --> 13:40.367
- Yeah.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.133
Back in the day,
when my dad was happily

13:42.166 --> 13:44.700
managing with George Michael
and before my mum,

13:44.734 --> 13:46.500
you know, stopped modeling
they were living

13:46.533 --> 13:48.333
a very lavish lifestyle.

13:48.367 --> 13:51.100
And as I got older,
the nice cars were going.

13:51.133 --> 13:53.333
The nice houses were going,
and then before you know it,

13:53.367 --> 13:56.266
they're fighting
about money 24/7.

13:56.300 --> 13:59.433
You know, it's like,
in my normal head,

13:59.467 --> 14:01.467
like a family is,
like, two incomes.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.734
A mum and dad.
That was my life,

14:03.767 --> 14:08.000
and now it's just completely
flip-turned opposite, right?

14:08.033 --> 14:10.467
And I'm the guy, like,
making the only income.

14:10.500 --> 14:13.033
It's just, like, for God's
sakes, like...it's too much.

14:13.066 --> 14:15.233
- James, that's too much,
James.

14:15.266 --> 14:18.367
The expectations I'm hearing
from you--you've put it

14:18.400 --> 14:20.300
upon your--like,
"I'm the one who's making

14:20.333 --> 14:23.400
the money, so it's on me."
- It sounds so stupid.

14:23.433 --> 14:25.533
When they're happy
or we're all having a good day,

14:25.567 --> 14:28.467
I mean it's just like,
you know, so, so good,

14:28.500 --> 14:31.500
but then it's just like--just
turns so quickly.

14:31.533 --> 14:34.233
- Your mom, she has a lot of
resentment towards your dad.

14:34.266 --> 14:35.567
- Oh, her sh-- is tired.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.266
- She is taking it out--
- She's still very angry.

14:37.300 --> 14:39.166
Very angry.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.000
- Set the boundary. "Mom, you
can't take it out on me."

14:42.033 --> 14:44.200
- I'll say that.
I'll tell her--I'll try that.

14:44.233 --> 14:47.500
- You know?
- Right.

14:47.533 --> 14:49.367
It really is frustrating

14:49.400 --> 14:51.600
when I am financially
helping my mum and my dad,

14:51.633 --> 14:53.600
and then I still get caught
in the crossfire between them,

14:53.633 --> 14:55.533
and I still get
treated like a ----ing child

14:55.567 --> 14:57.133
when I'm the man of the family
right now

14:57.166 --> 14:58.500
keeping
this whole thing together.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.000
All right, Mum...

15:04.200 --> 15:05.567
I need you to hear
something, Mom.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.500
You're not allowed to talk
to me about Dad anymore.

15:07.533 --> 15:09.367
You called me
yelling about Dad,

15:09.400 --> 15:11.133
and how he doesn't pay your
----ing bills,

15:11.166 --> 15:12.533
and then asking me
for more money.

15:12.567 --> 15:14.633
I can't deal with this anymore.
I'm done.

15:14.667 --> 15:18.133
Stop talking about--and what
do you want me to do?

15:18.166 --> 15:21.133
He's your ex-husband!
He's my father.

15:27.333 --> 15:29.033
- I'll provide and provide
and provide

15:29.066 --> 15:30.266
until I can't provide anymore,
and then boom,

15:30.300 --> 15:32.233
another fight, so it's, like,

15:32.266 --> 15:33.600
how are you
stressing my life out,

15:33.633 --> 15:35.400
and I'm financially
helping you?

15:35.433 --> 15:37.400
It's like, for (BLEEP)'s sake,
can I win at some point?

15:37.433 --> 15:39.066
Can I get something back,
please?

15:39.100 --> 15:40.633
You're my ----ing mother.

15:45.433 --> 15:47.200
- Coming up.
- What are you guys gonna do

15:47.233 --> 15:48.533
while I'm gone?
- I'm hanging out with the guys

15:48.567 --> 15:50.633
at the Mondrian.
- Don't disappoint me.

15:50.667 --> 15:53.300
- I should probably cancel
the strippers.

16:05.100 --> 16:07.333
- Bubba, are you jealous?
We're going on a private jet...

16:07.367 --> 16:10.066
- I'm jealous.
- To Solvang, and we're gonna

16:10.100 --> 16:12.200
go wine tasting.
- You guys gonna get

16:12.233 --> 16:15.100
"Girls Gone Wild" style?
- You never know.

16:15.133 --> 16:17.367
both: Come in.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.567
- Oh, hello.
- Hey. What's up, guys?

16:19.600 --> 16:21.333
- Hello.
- Everything's so clean.

16:21.367 --> 16:23.367
There's even, like,
a fresh thing of laundry.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.266
- Thanks for bringing that.
- All right, I'll make

16:25.300 --> 16:27.467
you guys a drink.
- I was just trying to make him

16:27.500 --> 16:29.633
feel jealous of our trip.

16:29.667 --> 16:32.100
- I'm so freaking excited.

16:32.133 --> 16:33.600
- I know, 'cause you've never
been on a private jet.

16:33.633 --> 16:35.500
- No. Never.
- It's, like, so much fun.

16:35.533 --> 16:37.200
- She's been calling it the PJ.

16:37.233 --> 16:38.567
- I used to think Lala was just

16:38.600 --> 16:41.133
some ratchet
little gold digger,

16:41.166 --> 16:44.533
always talking about how she's
flying on PJs here and there.

16:44.567 --> 16:46.367
- Well, I mean if you guys
flew private,

16:46.400 --> 16:47.700
you could always fly out
later, after?

16:47.734 --> 16:49.734
- I'll fly with
the rest of the world.

16:49.767 --> 16:52.266
- Yeah.
- But a couple months ago

16:52.300 --> 16:54.633
I went on a PJ
with her and Randall,

16:54.667 --> 16:58.233
and it was luxurious
as (BLEEP).

16:58.266 --> 17:00.433
- Is it Rand's jet?
- I think he's renting a jet.

17:00.467 --> 17:01.700
- Oh.
- Between Lala and Randall,

17:01.734 --> 17:03.633
they've completely
set up everything.

17:03.667 --> 17:05.266
- There's this whole
rooming situation.

17:05.300 --> 17:07.100
Like, who's rooming with who?

17:07.133 --> 17:08.300
I don't want to room
with Kristen.

17:08.333 --> 17:09.700
- Okay.
I will room with Kristen then.

17:09.734 --> 17:12.100
I can handle her.

17:12.133 --> 17:13.734
- Kristen does not travel
well.

17:13.767 --> 17:16.667
She is such a bad traveler
that when we went

17:16.700 --> 17:21.166
on a girls' trip to Copenhagen
she had such a major freak-out

17:21.200 --> 17:24.333
that she left
and flew back home

17:24.367 --> 17:26.667
instead of coming
with us to Paris.

17:26.700 --> 17:30.433
It's midnight in Paris!
- Whoo!

17:30.467 --> 17:32.266
- That's next level.

17:32.300 --> 17:34.333
- I just hope that
I'm able to, you know, like,

17:34.367 --> 17:36.467
turn my phone off or not pick
up my phone after midnight.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.400
- Yeah. She goes crazy after
midnight usually.

17:38.433 --> 17:39.400
- Yeah.
- That's why she goes

17:39.433 --> 17:42.233
to bed early.

17:42.266 --> 17:44.166
- She is, like, Dr. Jekyll
and Mrs. Hyde.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.767
- I'd rather be a werewolf.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.233
- You want to be a--
- Let me be a werewolf.

17:49.266 --> 17:51.200
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:51.233 --> 17:54.166
- Do whatever you want.

17:58.567 --> 18:02.166
- Oh, is it here?
Okay.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.700
- Hi.
- Hello.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.433
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi. I'm Brittany.

18:05.467 --> 18:06.700
- Lindsey.
- Hi. Good to see you again.

18:06.734 --> 18:08.433
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to see you.

18:08.467 --> 18:10.166
Welcome.
Sit wherever you want.

18:10.200 --> 18:12.266
- Thank you so much.
It feels good in here.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.166
- Welcome.
- Hello.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.734
- Hello. Hi. Hi.
- This is Brittany.

18:15.767 --> 18:17.433
- Yes.
- Hi, Brittany.

18:17.467 --> 18:19.200
- My fiancée.

18:19.233 --> 18:20.567
- Congratulations.
- We're fiancés now.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.633
- We're fiancés.
- Very exciting.

18:22.667 --> 18:24.633
- So that's kind of why
I wanted to come here,

18:24.667 --> 18:27.500
because I've never done therapy
before, so I'm kind of nervous.

18:27.533 --> 18:29.300
- What are you nervous about?
- Oh, just 'cause I don't know,

18:29.333 --> 18:31.767
like,
what goes on or anything, so...

18:32.000 --> 18:33.567
- Like, are we gonna
talk about, like...

18:33.600 --> 18:35.166
- This is my first time.
- Difficult things or like--

18:35.200 --> 18:36.567
- We're actually doing
really good right now.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.567
I've made a change.
A big change I think, right?

18:38.600 --> 18:40.333
- Mm-hmm.
- How's that?

18:40.367 --> 18:43.033
- Just making better choices.
Starting to settle down.

18:43.066 --> 18:44.500
I was a little bit
of a wild child.

18:44.533 --> 18:46.600
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- I'm a little tad bit

18:46.633 --> 18:48.200
hung over.

18:48.233 --> 18:49.600
I ended things
with my girlfriend.

18:49.633 --> 18:51.767
I just don't know
how to have a girlfriend.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.734
I just--I don't know
how to do the right things.

18:53.767 --> 18:57.567
Soon as my father passed way,
like, it, like, was--it kind of

18:57.600 --> 18:59.667
just--okay.
It all cleared up for me.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.533
- I'm sorry. That's sad.
- I know what

19:01.567 --> 19:03.033
I'm supposed to do.
- What are you supposed to do?

19:03.066 --> 19:04.400
- I know how to live.
I know how to do things

19:04.433 --> 19:06.266
the right way now.
We like to stay home

19:06.300 --> 19:07.667
and play games
and laugh, and--

19:07.700 --> 19:09.600
- Be together.
both: Yeah.

19:09.633 --> 19:11.467
- That's great, but I think,
obviously, in any relationship,

19:11.500 --> 19:14.300
there's challenges,
and you know, it's not perfect.

19:14.333 --> 19:15.767
I know about last summer.
I know--you know,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.600
it's just sort of, like,
what needs to be healed?

19:18.633 --> 19:20.233
Do you guys ever talk
about it now?

19:20.266 --> 19:21.333
Like, what happened last year?

19:21.367 --> 19:22.367
- No.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.066
I don't really want to.

19:25.100 --> 19:27.033
- He's done a lot better,
but, like, sometimes,

19:27.066 --> 19:28.633
if we ever have to bring up
our past he's, like,

19:28.667 --> 19:30.066
super shut off about it...
- I don't like talking

19:30.100 --> 19:32.033
about it.
- And, like, doesn't want me

19:32.066 --> 19:34.033
to, like, ever talk about it,
and sometimes that can be hard.

19:34.066 --> 19:35.700
I don't bring up
Jax's cheating last year

19:35.734 --> 19:37.734
hardly at all anymore,

19:37.767 --> 19:40.600
so I want Jax to be able
to talk to me and listen to me.

19:40.633 --> 19:44.400
- I mean, but it's just--
it's like, we've dealt with it.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.233
We've kind of put it to bed.
Haven't we? Or no?

19:46.266 --> 19:47.600
- It doesn't sound like that.
- No, no.

19:47.633 --> 19:49.500
We have, for sure,
but see, like, he gets,

19:49.533 --> 19:51.300
like, tense if it gets
brought up.

19:51.333 --> 19:53.333
- I'm not tense at all,
but I just don't see any reason

19:53.367 --> 19:55.233
to talk about
something like that.

19:55.266 --> 19:56.700
- Well, just because
it's a big thing...

19:56.734 --> 19:58.367
- Because--but we talked about
it so much already, like...

19:58.400 --> 19:59.400
- And we're going
into marriage.

19:59.433 --> 20:00.567
I know, honey. I know.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.033
- What do we need
to talk about?

20:02.066 --> 20:03.233
We're all good.
Planning a wedding.

20:03.266 --> 20:04.734
We're happy.
Period.

20:04.767 --> 20:06.667
- I totally understand,
but you're telling her

20:06.700 --> 20:09.533
basically, "Shut up."
- Yeah.

20:09.567 --> 20:11.667
- And if she's a people
pleaser, then you're gonna

20:11.700 --> 20:13.433
be like, "Okay, fine."
- Yeah.

20:13.467 --> 20:14.767
- And then you're both gonna
know that things are not

20:15.000 --> 20:16.433
really honest between you guys.
- Yeah.

20:16.467 --> 20:18.400
- I just want to make sure
that, like,

20:18.433 --> 20:20.667
if bad things go on between us,
that wouldn't happen again.

20:20.700 --> 20:22.533
Like, he wouldn't cheat or do
any--you know what I mean?

20:22.567 --> 20:24.300
- Yeah.
- Sometimes I'll have days of,

20:24.333 --> 20:26.300
like, resentment.
I can't help that.

20:26.333 --> 20:28.567
- I understand it doesn't feel
good to talk about this stuff,

20:28.600 --> 20:30.266
but it's part of...
- And that's--

20:30.300 --> 20:31.567
- What needs to be healed.
- I mean--okay.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.000
- What? Why are you
rolling your eyes?

20:33.033 --> 20:34.734
- Well, no.
I mean it's just--okay. Okay.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.033
- Tell me. I'm curious.
- It's fine. It's fine.

20:37.066 --> 20:40.033
- So don't get, like,
mad if we go back there.

20:40.066 --> 20:42.100
It's just to move past it.
It's not--

20:42.133 --> 20:44.066
- I'm not mad.
I'm just--I don't understand.

20:44.100 --> 20:45.767
That's all. I'm not mad.
I just don't understand.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.567
It's okay
not to understand something.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.433
I don't understand how going
back to that

20:50.467 --> 20:53.567
can make anything better.
- Yeah.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.567
Like, how do you know that
you wouldn't go back

20:55.600 --> 20:58.467
into those ways, I guess?
- I just know.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.133
- The goal of couples therapy
is talking about

21:00.166 --> 21:02.033
what's really happening
between you guys, and the

21:02.066 --> 21:03.567
question is are you going to
address what's going on,

21:03.600 --> 21:05.367
or are you gonna act
like everything's fine?

21:05.400 --> 21:07.033
- That's what I don't want.
I just want to keep

21:07.066 --> 21:08.567
on the right track.
- Totally, and part of keeping

21:08.600 --> 21:10.000
on the right track is,
like, being really honest

21:10.033 --> 21:11.367
with each other.
- Yeah.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.667
- Not hiding things
from each other.

21:12.700 --> 21:15.100
Just be more transparent.

21:18.734 --> 21:20.600
- Coming up.
- Was I a sh---y mother?

21:20.633 --> 21:23.734
Great vacations. Ralph Lauren.
Burberry.

21:23.767 --> 21:26.500
You took your first steps
at ----ing Tiffany's.

21:33.300 --> 21:33.767
- ♪ I think I need you ♪

21:36.433 --> 21:39.600
♪ Understand I'ma do,
what you think I came for? ♪

21:39.633 --> 21:43.100
♪ I think I should pull you,
you can take it in time ♪

21:43.133 --> 21:46.100
♪ I think I'll just--I think
I'll be fine ♪

21:46.133 --> 21:49.667
- Yeah.

21:49.700 --> 21:53.667
How fire. Whoo.
- Whoo.

21:53.700 --> 21:57.500
Do you think there's, like,
that one little piece of quiet

21:57.533 --> 21:59.433
after the word "for?"
- It could be like,

21:59.467 --> 22:02.667
"What'd you think I came for?
I-I-I-I think I--"

22:02.700 --> 22:04.533
- Yeah. That'd be cute. Yeah.

22:04.567 --> 22:06.100
Recording with James was, like,

22:06.133 --> 22:08.200
a great first-time,
rip the Band-Aid off,

22:08.233 --> 22:11.000
first exposure to being
in a recording studio.

22:11.033 --> 22:13.133
♪ I think I need you ♪

22:13.166 --> 22:16.667
♪ Understand, I'ma do what you
think I came for ♪

22:16.700 --> 22:19.400
- Whoo-hoo!
- So good.

22:19.433 --> 22:21.033
- So much better.

22:21.066 --> 22:22.667
- You've heard
of Ariana Grande.

22:22.700 --> 22:25.233
You better watch out
for Ariana Venti, bitch.

22:25.266 --> 22:28.467
I think it's really fun.
- Thank you.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.133
- Your mom's coming soon.

22:30.166 --> 22:32.433
- Well, how's that going?
Everything with--

22:32.467 --> 22:35.133
both: Family?
- It's all right, you know.

22:35.166 --> 22:37.200
I mean I've started
seeing a therapist,

22:37.233 --> 22:39.133
and I'm just trying
to figure out

22:39.166 --> 22:43.000
how I can avoid future fights
with my mum.

22:43.033 --> 22:44.767
It's like, you know,
"(BLEEP) you.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
(BLEEP) you," down the phone.
It's not good for us,

22:47.033 --> 22:48.700
but I just feel like
some boundaries go--like,

22:48.734 --> 22:51.767
learning how to, you know,
say "no" in the right ways

22:52.000 --> 22:55.166
and have her being able
to not get mad at me.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.066
- Well, good. It sounds like
you're doing

22:57.100 --> 22:58.633
a lot
of good sh-- for yourself.

22:58.667 --> 23:00.600
- He's been going
to the gym a lot.

23:00.633 --> 23:02.567
- Gym and I picked up
golf again.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.500
-  Picked up golf.

23:04.533 --> 23:07.033
You know, James, you can be,
like, sober, and responsible,

23:07.066 --> 23:08.700
and not be a 65-year-old man.

23:08.734 --> 23:10.700
- Yeah.

23:10.734 --> 23:12.700
- "Gone to the
country club today."

23:12.734 --> 23:16.033
- Yeah, basically.

23:16.066 --> 23:19.166
- That's my mama.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.500
both: Hi.
- Oh, my gosh.

23:21.533 --> 23:24.133
- Oh, they meet
for the first time.

23:24.166 --> 23:27.033
- Yeah, lookit.
- Is this your doggy?

23:27.066 --> 23:29.233
- This is my rescue.
- Aww.

23:29.266 --> 23:31.000
- Yes.
- She's so cute.

23:31.033 --> 23:32.700
- She's so sweet.
She has one ear.

23:32.734 --> 23:35.533
She's gonna go pee all over
his furniture right now. Hi.

23:35.567 --> 23:37.166
- Hi.
- How are you?

23:37.200 --> 23:38.633
- Good to see you. Good.
- You guys are making music?

23:38.667 --> 23:41.266
- Yeah, so I'm gonna go, but...
- Bye.

23:41.300 --> 23:43.166
- Bye. Good to see you.
- Thanks for coming over.

23:43.200 --> 23:45.767
What I want for my relationship
with my mom is peace,

23:46.000 --> 23:49.100
and no down-talking,
no shutting someone out,

23:49.133 --> 23:52.166
and actually listening
to me like a ----ing person.

23:52.200 --> 23:54.300
- What you been up to?
Did you go to therapy?

23:54.333 --> 23:55.734
- Yes.

23:55.767 --> 23:58.734
Lots of talking
about family stuff,

23:58.767 --> 24:02.500
and I just think setting
some boundaries

24:02.533 --> 24:06.066
would be a good thing.

24:06.100 --> 24:08.033
Like, you can't talk
to me about Dad.

24:08.066 --> 24:09.533
- Okay.
- Okay?

24:09.567 --> 24:11.066
- No, but you say, "Okay,"
but then, like, we--

24:11.100 --> 24:13.066
- I won't.
- When he pisses you off

24:13.100 --> 24:14.734
or something happened
or he didn't send you

24:14.767 --> 24:16.767
enough money--
- Pause right there.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.533
- What?
- He doesn't send me money.

24:18.567 --> 24:19.567
- He doesn't send you money.
I know...

24:19.600 --> 24:21.000
- No. Let's clarify.
Ever.

24:21.033 --> 24:22.166
- Ever. Right.
- Ever.

24:22.200 --> 24:24.100
'Cause that will make
my blood boil.

24:24.133 --> 24:26.767
He's the one that left me
with my three children with

24:27.000 --> 24:29.633
----ing nothing.
He got his own apartment.

24:29.667 --> 24:32.667
Did his thing.
Went ----ing scuba diving.

24:32.700 --> 24:34.600
- What are you--
- Yes, I'm bitter.

24:34.633 --> 24:37.166
- But like you always do that.
You put me in the middle.

24:37.200 --> 24:38.767
Do you not see that?
And it's not fair.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.567
- You're telling me, "Let's...
create a boundary," right?

24:40.600 --> 24:42.133
- That's the first boundary.
- So let's create it.

24:42.166 --> 24:44.000
Perfect. Done.
- Don't talk to me about Dad.

24:44.033 --> 24:48.233
Second thing is that, if I'm
financially helping anyone,

24:48.266 --> 24:52.567
I want to see what I'm doing.
No, Mum. Don't shake your head.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.100
I'm sending you $200
every three days.

24:55.133 --> 24:57.233
- $200 every three days? No.
- Do you want to see

24:57.266 --> 24:59.133
my PayPal?
- Okay. Fine.

24:59.166 --> 25:00.633
And what do I do
with that money?

25:00.667 --> 25:02.667
I've got Dylan.
I've got Harry.

25:02.700 --> 25:04.600
Was I a sh---y mother?

25:04.633 --> 25:07.667
You went to a £50,000
school--a year, right?

25:07.700 --> 25:12.166
Great vacations. Ralph Lauren.
Burberry. This is bullsh--.

25:12.200 --> 25:15.266
You took your first steps at
----ing Tiffany's.

25:15.300 --> 25:17.233
I'm not telling you
to kiss my ass.

25:17.266 --> 25:18.633
I'm saying, "Say
'thank you, Mum.

25:18.667 --> 25:20.166
You did something for me.'"

25:20.200 --> 25:21.600
- No, that--
- "You're not a total bitch."

25:21.633 --> 25:23.133
Right?
- I'm not saying

25:23.166 --> 25:24.567
that you're a bitch.
- Your mom cares about--

25:24.600 --> 25:25.767
- That's how you're
making me feel.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.533
I feel like a child.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.567
- No. I feel like the child,
and I am the child.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.000
- No. You are. You are.

25:31.033 --> 25:32.166
- And you need
to remember that.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.633
When you first breaking up
with Dad

25:33.667 --> 25:36.000
I was in ----ing hell,
and, like, I'm--

25:36.033 --> 25:37.700
- Oh, and I wasn't?
- No. Oh, but I'm not saying--

25:37.734 --> 25:39.567
- We all were in hell, James.
It wasn't just James' hell.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.600
- I'm just saying my feelings.
- Don't do that, James.

25:41.633 --> 25:43.133
- 'Cause your tone. Your tone.
Your tone.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.166
- Yes, my tone.
- All right, Mum.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.300
I'm asking for
those boundaries.

25:47.333 --> 25:49.200
- What? What?
- Don't involve me

25:49.233 --> 25:51.266
with Dad anymore, and just show
me what I'm helping with.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.600
- Perfect. Perfect.
- Because I see it going

25:52.633 --> 25:54.233
nowhere, and I see
our relationship

25:54.266 --> 25:56.367
going downhill again,
and I don't want that.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.600
- Fine.

26:07.433 --> 26:10.166
- All right, what else
can I pack for this trip?

26:10.200 --> 26:12.734
I am just excited
for my girls' trip.

26:12.767 --> 26:14.266
- What are you doing?
All I know is you're going

26:14.300 --> 26:15.734
on a private jet.
- We're going to "So Vain"

26:15.767 --> 26:18.033
or whatever it's called.
- It's called what?

26:18.066 --> 26:19.300
- "So Vain" or something
like that.

26:19.333 --> 26:21.333
- All you girls
arriving on a private jet

26:21.367 --> 26:23.367
going to a place
called "so vain?"

26:23.400 --> 26:25.200
It couldn't be
any more perfect.

26:25.233 --> 26:29.166
-  "Solvang."
- I like my version better.

26:29.200 --> 26:31.266
- I wanted to kind of let it

26:31.300 --> 26:33.433
rest for, like, 24 hours,

26:33.467 --> 26:35.100
but what'd you think
of therapy?

26:35.133 --> 26:37.400
Was it what you expected?
- I don't know.

26:37.433 --> 26:39.066
I think she said
a lot of things that make

26:39.100 --> 26:40.166
a lot of sense,
so I kind of would like

26:40.200 --> 26:42.734
to go back and see her.

26:42.767 --> 26:46.200
- You probably should go maybe
once or twice by yourself.

26:46.233 --> 26:48.700
- No.
- I don't know.

26:48.734 --> 26:51.700
We'll see how you want
to handle that. I don't know.

26:51.734 --> 26:53.667
- I just thought that it was
pretty good for us.

26:53.700 --> 26:57.333
- Yeah, yeah. I'm down.
- What are you guys gonna do

26:57.367 --> 26:59.667
while I'm gone?
- Well, I'm hanging out

26:59.700 --> 27:02.600
with the guys at the Mondrian.

27:02.633 --> 27:05.133
- Y'all can't let us have
our girl time.

27:05.166 --> 27:07.100
You got to always
do something yourselves.

27:07.133 --> 27:08.333
- You got to understand:

27:08.367 --> 27:10.233
our guys' nights
aren't that nuts.

27:10.266 --> 27:12.233
Let's ----ing party.

27:12.266 --> 27:14.100
There's plenty of women
in here now.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.433
Oh, my God. I want to make you
make out with somebody.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.367
- You did bring girls
back here, Jax.

27:17.400 --> 27:20.233
- You need to get off work.
Come hang out with us.

27:20.266 --> 27:21.767
- Definitely railed the sh--
out of that girl

27:22.000 --> 27:24.767
in the bathroom.
- I like that. Yeah.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
- Don't disappoint me.

27:27.033 --> 27:30.000
I don't want to go back
into those old feelings.

27:30.033 --> 27:31.767
Like, I just can't do that.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.200
- I should probably cancel the
strippers that I hired then.

27:34.233 --> 27:36.667
-  Shut up.

27:39.333 --> 27:41.734
- Coming up.
- Is this just lavender?

27:41.767 --> 27:44.000
'Cause I ate it.

27:44.033 --> 27:45.400
- I promise
we're sophisticated.

27:45.433 --> 27:47.467
- So this is merlot.
- I think merlot

27:47.500 --> 27:49.467
is the basic bitch of wine.

27:55.266 --> 27:56.000
- ♪ I think you're lying

27:56.000 --> 27:56.567
- ♪ I think you're lying
and it's killing me inside ♪

27:58.367 --> 28:00.467
♪ Oh, I know this can't
be right ♪

28:00.500 --> 28:04.233
♪ But I can't let go ♪

28:04.266 --> 28:06.233
- No, no.
It was a large pan--hey.

28:06.266 --> 28:07.467
- Stop flirting.
- I'm not flirting

28:07.500 --> 28:09.166
with anybody.
I was just saying...

28:09.200 --> 28:10.433
- You're always flirting.
- Hi to everybody.

28:10.467 --> 28:12.033
How you doing?
- Good.

28:12.066 --> 28:13.400
- Good?
- What's happening?

28:13.433 --> 28:15.233
- Well, I have a table
in the garden for you.

28:15.266 --> 28:18.066
- My kind of drinks, man.
Jack and ginger. Rum and Coke.

28:18.100 --> 28:21.100
- There you go. There you go.
- I'm a master at those.

28:21.133 --> 28:22.433
- You are.

28:22.467 --> 28:26.133
Two ingredients or less.
Jax Taylor.

28:29.433 --> 28:30.767
- Is Lisa here?
- Yeah.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.367
She's actually in the back.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.500
- Hello.
- How are you?

28:34.533 --> 28:37.133
- How are you?
I'm good. How are you?

28:37.166 --> 28:41.300
- Okay, Jackie. Sit.

28:41.333 --> 28:44.433
- You look beautiful.
- Oh, the lighting.

28:44.467 --> 28:46.600
I make sure everybody
looks beautiful in this place.

28:46.633 --> 28:49.100
- I saw James today,

28:49.133 --> 28:53.300
and I was hoping
he would be working here again.

28:53.333 --> 28:55.233
- Look, I--
- He's gone to therapy.

28:55.266 --> 28:59.066
He's not been drinking.
Lisa, he needs it.

28:59.100 --> 29:01.400
- Going to therapy and not
drinking--it's a start,

29:01.433 --> 29:03.066
and I know he has
to start somewhere,

29:03.100 --> 29:05.266
but he needs to really be
committed to this.

29:05.300 --> 29:08.333
I mean he was in trouble,
and he's got anger issues,

29:08.367 --> 29:10.166
and you see that.
- I know.

29:10.200 --> 29:12.033
He's got a lot of things
that he's got

29:12.066 --> 29:16.000
to come to terms with,
you know, about me and his dad.

29:16.033 --> 29:17.400
You know, a lot
of his anger stems from that.

29:17.433 --> 29:19.400
- But you've got to
help him with that.

29:19.433 --> 29:21.633
- I know, but I have to ask you
something else.

29:21.667 --> 29:24.233
Harry's back from college.

29:26.333 --> 29:29.600
- I love you. Congratulations.
So nice...

29:29.633 --> 29:33.533
- Can he come and bus
two nights a week?

29:33.567 --> 29:39.133
- James has been a major pain
in my arse, and I'm not sure

29:39.166 --> 29:43.133
I want to go through the
same experience with Harry,

29:43.166 --> 29:45.433
but maybe,
if his brother's working too,

29:45.467 --> 29:50.567
James doesn't have to bear the
sole burden of the finances.

29:50.600 --> 29:52.633
I'd like to meet him.
- I'd love for you to meet him.

29:52.667 --> 29:54.500
- I want to help your
situation. I really do.

29:54.533 --> 29:56.200
- You know, thank you.
I want you to meet him,

29:56.233 --> 29:57.567
regardless.
- All right. Good to see you.

29:57.600 --> 30:00.533
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

30:00.567 --> 30:02.433
Love you, Vanderpump.

30:15.266 --> 30:18.166
- 'Sup, bitches?
- Hi.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.233
- Are we ready?

30:20.266 --> 30:22.500
Oh, we got some Dom
on the plane.

30:22.533 --> 30:25.633
Randall? He's the one
paying for the plane.

30:25.667 --> 30:27.567
That's what he does
for the baby.

30:29.433 --> 30:30.633
- Yeah.
- Oh, sh--.

30:30.667 --> 30:32.633
Why did it do that?

30:32.667 --> 30:34.600
- But if Rand were
to be gone tomorrow,

30:34.633 --> 30:36.500
would I be flying private?

30:36.533 --> 30:38.333
Probably, just
with a different guy.

30:38.367 --> 30:40.467
No, I'm just kidding.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.166
But seriously I probably would.

30:43.333 --> 30:46.600
- I guess Kristen--
- Forgot her purse.

30:46.633 --> 30:50.367
- Yeah.
- This morning--okay.

30:50.400 --> 30:53.567
I told Katie that we shouldn't
carpool with Kristen,

30:53.600 --> 30:56.367
because Kristen is always late,
so I'm waiting

30:56.400 --> 30:58.700
and waiting and waiting.
Finally, Katie then responds

30:58.734 --> 31:01.333
that they have to
turn back around,

31:01.367 --> 31:03.700
because she forgot her purse.

31:03.734 --> 31:06.367
But I've never been
on a private jet before,

31:06.400 --> 31:09.533
so I am not going to
let Kristen ruin my trip.

31:09.567 --> 31:13.100
- Oh, my effing God.
I'm on a private jet.

31:13.133 --> 31:15.200
- Hi, baby.
- I'm so excited.

31:15.233 --> 31:18.400
- Ahh!
- The party's here, bitches.

31:18.433 --> 31:20.266
Stassi literally
goes out of her way

31:20.300 --> 31:23.667
to be an asshole to me.
You know what? I am who I am.

31:23.700 --> 31:25.433
- You guys ready to go?
- Everybody.

31:25.467 --> 31:27.700
- Yeah.
- We're mother----ing ready.

31:27.734 --> 31:29.567
- We have some virgins
on the plane.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.233
- Oh, good.
- So I'm popping

31:31.266 --> 31:32.500
all their PJ cherries.
- I'm a virgin.

31:32.533 --> 31:34.367
- Okay.
Well, then we should be safe.

31:37.633 --> 31:40.700
- Hold on to your glasses.
- Hold on to your butts.

31:40.734 --> 31:42.567
- Hold on to your tits,
bitches.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.633
- I don't have a butt!

31:44.667 --> 31:46.500
- My stomach is, like,
literally in my asshole

31:46.533 --> 31:48.667
right now.
Yeah, okay. I'll be all right.

31:48.700 --> 31:50.400
I'm not gonna ruin it
for y'all.

31:50.433 --> 31:53.133
- We on the PJ, bitches,
and none of us paid for it!

31:53.166 --> 31:54.700
all: Whoo!

31:54.734 --> 31:57.633
- I found something for you.

31:58.734 --> 32:00.734
- Hello.

32:03.767 --> 32:06.600
- What's the Wi-Fi code?
- Just try to get on.

32:06.633 --> 32:09.233
You may not have to even--
- The Wi-Fi password is

32:09.266 --> 32:12.633
"sucks if you're not on a PJ."
Capital S.

32:12.667 --> 32:15.166
Look at this.
There's gold hardware.

32:16.400 --> 32:17.667
I said I wasn't
gonna record it.

32:17.700 --> 32:19.700
I was just gonna live
in the moment.

32:19.734 --> 32:22.433
----ing living in the moment.

32:22.467 --> 32:25.266
It's like
I designed this plane.

32:25.300 --> 32:27.600
What the F? Why did I wait
so long to do this?

32:27.633 --> 32:29.467
Now that I've flown
on a private jet,

32:29.500 --> 32:32.166
I'm gonna name my firstborn PJ.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.266
- The water's so clear.
- Okay, ladies.

32:34.300 --> 32:36.300
We've got about six minutes
'til we land,

32:36.333 --> 32:37.500
so if you want to--
- No!

32:37.533 --> 32:38.767
- Six minutes?
- Six minutes!

32:39.000 --> 32:41.333
- I wanna stay up here
forever and ever!

32:41.367 --> 32:43.767
- This has been the best
25 minutes of my life.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.266
- What's up, dude?
How you doing?

32:56.300 --> 32:57.667
- How are you?
- Hey, man. How you doing? Jax.

32:57.700 --> 32:59.300
- This is my brother Harry.
- Harry?

32:59.333 --> 33:00.633
- Yes.
- How you doing?

33:00.667 --> 33:02.300
- You're here early.
Got a big night tonight?

33:02.333 --> 33:04.567
- Yeah. We planned
a guys' night tonight.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.567
- Oh.
- I want to work though, 'cause

33:06.600 --> 33:08.500
I need to make the money, but--
- You guys going drinking?

33:08.533 --> 33:09.700
- I think so.
It's gonna be

33:09.734 --> 33:11.266
one of those rallies.
Those hard nights.

33:11.300 --> 33:12.567
- (BLEEP).

33:12.600 --> 33:14.300
Jax. I feel like he gets
a pleasure

33:14.333 --> 33:15.533
in telling me
there's a guys' night tonight,

33:15.567 --> 33:17.300
and him not having
to invite me?

33:17.333 --> 33:19.200
It must feel ----ing great.

33:19.233 --> 33:21.567
I'm not even gonna let it
bother me, you know.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.567
- I'm looking forward to it,
'cause I need a night out.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.333
So what are you guys up to?

33:25.367 --> 33:26.600
- Got a little interview today.
- Oh, yeah?

33:26.633 --> 33:28.266
- Yeah.
- Bartender? Waiter? Busser?

33:28.300 --> 33:30.233
- Busser.
- My mum actually helped me

33:30.266 --> 33:31.600
get a job at Sur
when I was much younger,

33:31.633 --> 33:33.467
so I'm here for Harry

33:33.500 --> 33:35.400
because it's his interview.
It's a big day for him.

33:35.433 --> 33:36.734
- How's it going?
- Hi.

33:36.767 --> 33:38.633
- You guys good?
- This is my brother Harry.

33:38.667 --> 33:40.200
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

33:40.233 --> 33:41.367
- Ready? Come on.
Come on. Let's go.

33:41.400 --> 33:42.467
- Good luck, man.
Nice to meet you.

33:42.500 --> 33:44.200
- You too.
- All right,

33:44.233 --> 33:45.567
Have a good night tonight.
- See you later. Thanks.

33:50.767 --> 33:52.734
- Hi. Thank you.

33:56.767 --> 33:59.533
- We're gonna go to the hotel
and then have

33:59.567 --> 34:01.767
a little wine tasting,
if you want to pop in,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.767
but tomorrow will be,
like, the full day of wineries.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.367
I've always wanted to go to
Solvang

34:07.400 --> 34:09.266
because I'm obsessed
with the movie Sideways

34:09.300 --> 34:12.400
and I am praying that one of
these bitches gets so drunk

34:12.433 --> 34:15.567
that they drink out of the spit
bucket like Paul Giamatti did.

34:15.600 --> 34:18.467
- I love girls' trips.
- And can I say what I love?

34:18.500 --> 34:20.233
That we're far away.

34:20.266 --> 34:22.533
Like, not too far
that I start freaking out.

34:22.567 --> 34:24.266
- Are you like a Kristen

34:24.300 --> 34:25.600
where you freak out
if you're too far away?

34:25.633 --> 34:27.533
- But this trip's gonna be
badass,

34:27.567 --> 34:29.433
'cause we're in California.
- Okay. No.

34:29.467 --> 34:31.333
I understand that, but Kristen,
you were already,

34:31.367 --> 34:33.667
like, 40 minutes late,
and it stressed me out.

34:33.700 --> 34:36.533
- I'm late a lot. I just am.
- Sometimes there are things

34:36.567 --> 34:38.333
that you just have to do
to be on time

34:38.367 --> 34:42.400
so that other people
aren't late to things.

34:42.433 --> 34:45.367
I spent more time waiting
on the sidewalk for Kristen

34:45.400 --> 34:49.300
to show up this morning
than I did on the PJ.

34:49.333 --> 34:51.533
- You guys, look. We're coming
into the little town.

34:51.567 --> 34:53.100
- Oh, it's so cute.

34:53.133 --> 34:57.433
- I see a windmill.

34:59.700 --> 35:02.000
- Y'all, this is cute.

35:02.033 --> 35:04.700
- Hey, ladies. Checking in?
- Yes, we are.

35:04.734 --> 35:07.533
- Last name please?
- It should be under "Kent."

35:07.567 --> 35:09.600
- Perfect.
Let me get you your room key.

35:09.633 --> 35:12.533
- You guys are--
- I'm not rooming with Stassi.

35:12.567 --> 35:15.266
- You're with me.
Brittany, you're with Lala.

35:15.300 --> 35:17.734
- And Scheana has the...
- Yeah.

35:17.767 --> 35:20.533
- Bachelorette pad
- The bachelorette pad.

35:20.567 --> 35:22.333
- Naturally, I assumed
on this trip

35:22.367 --> 35:24.333
I would room with Ariana,

35:24.367 --> 35:27.467
because she's my bestie,
but I'm being singled out.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.033
I live by myself.

35:29.066 --> 35:31.333
I don't want to room by myself
on a vacation.

35:31.367 --> 35:32.734
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your stay.

35:32.767 --> 35:36.667
- Thank you.
- Yay.

35:36.700 --> 35:39.367
- Oh, my God, it's so cute.
- Whoa!

35:39.400 --> 35:41.600
- It's like a house.
- I can't wait to Instagram

35:41.633 --> 35:46.300
the (BLEEP) out of this...
- Oh, this is adorable.

35:46.333 --> 35:49.433
- It's super cute.
- Oh, it is so cute.

35:49.467 --> 35:51.633
- You have to sleep
by the window, so--

35:51.667 --> 35:55.700
- In case I want to flee
in the middle of the night?

35:55.734 --> 35:58.700
- Oh, my gosh. Holy sh--.
Central air conditioning.

35:58.734 --> 36:01.567
- Oh, and there's
a coffeemaker. Thank God.

36:01.600 --> 36:04.033
- There's wine. Thank God.

36:12.433 --> 36:14.166
- Cute.

36:19.400 --> 36:22.767
Well, I guess it's still
just you and me, Love Frog.

36:26.633 --> 36:28.734
- Coming up.
- I don't need a busboy.

36:28.767 --> 36:31.700
I need a DJ, because you know,
he keep ----ing it up.

36:44.166 --> 36:47.700
- I'm sorry, but Stassi--
she screamed at me, Katie,

36:47.734 --> 36:49.633
in your car.
- I know. I know.

36:49.667 --> 36:51.467
- Packed with four people.
- And I just--I, like--I didn't

36:51.500 --> 36:53.133
want to get involved.
- But then I leave my ----ing

36:53.166 --> 36:55.567
purse on the floor.
By Gibson's potty pad,

36:55.600 --> 36:57.166
because Carter's sleeping.
I have to make sure

36:57.200 --> 37:00.467
my dogs are in the room,
so they don't pee on the rug.

37:00.500 --> 37:03.233
- You would think that because
Kristen is such a bad traveler

37:03.266 --> 37:05.767
that Carter would be willing
to get his ass out of bed

37:06.000 --> 37:09.233
and help her get out the door,
but I guess he don't do that.

37:09.266 --> 37:11.500
So now I have a stressed-out

37:11.533 --> 37:12.767
terrorist traveler

37:13.000 --> 37:14.567
staying in my room with me.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.533
Listen, I get it.
I just think--just drop it.

37:17.567 --> 37:19.467
We're here. Let it go.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.600
- Yeah. I don't want to waste
this trip on that sh--.

37:28.033 --> 37:30.567
- James, how's it going?

37:30.600 --> 37:33.133
It's been a while.
- It feels like forever.

37:33.166 --> 37:35.233
Is Guillermo joining us today?
- Yeah. Guillermo will

37:35.266 --> 37:36.767
be joining us today.
- I thought we got--we had it

37:37.000 --> 37:39.633
lucky with just you.
- Oh, no, no, no.

37:39.667 --> 37:43.000
- Give me the W-9. Let's go.
- How do you like Sur, so far?

37:43.033 --> 37:46.000
- I mean I come here a lot
because he's been here,

37:46.033 --> 37:47.667
so--but I love the environment
here and everything.

37:47.700 --> 37:49.734
- What's happening?
all: Hey.

37:49.767 --> 37:51.700
- Good to see you.
- How you doing, man?

37:51.734 --> 37:54.033
- He's looking for a job,
this one.

37:54.066 --> 37:55.533
- Hopefully, yeah.
- What are you looking for?

37:55.567 --> 37:57.033
- Just a couple nights a week,
honestly.

37:57.066 --> 37:58.700
I just graduated
from school, so--

37:58.734 --> 38:00.700
- You want to be a manager?
- A busser for now and just

38:00.734 --> 38:03.467
kind of maybe work my way up.
- Remember that five years ago?

38:03.500 --> 38:06.033
Five years ago, he was sitting
right there, in the lounge.

38:06.066 --> 38:07.433
I think he said,
"You know, I'm a DJ.

38:07.467 --> 38:09.000
I want to be a DJ,"
and I said to him,

38:09.033 --> 38:10.266
"Well, actually
I don't need a DJ.

38:10.300 --> 38:12.500
I need a busboy."

38:14.500 --> 38:18.066
- Hi, guys. How are you?
- But going back to you.

38:18.100 --> 38:20.166
I don't need a busboy.
You know what I need?

38:20.200 --> 38:23.200
I need a DJ.

38:23.233 --> 38:27.033
Because you know,
he keep ----ing it up.

38:27.066 --> 38:28.700
What I'm gonna do,
because we are friends,

38:28.734 --> 38:30.033
we're gonna bring you over,
okay.

38:30.066 --> 38:31.200
Doesn't mean anything.
- Right.

38:31.233 --> 38:32.300
- You're gonna train,
two week.

38:32.333 --> 38:33.500
I wanna hear from him,

38:33.533 --> 38:34.500
I wanna hear from everybody

38:34.533 --> 38:36.033
- He's a hard worker.

38:36.066 --> 38:38.066
- Yeah, I hear that before,
for you

38:38.100 --> 38:40.200
- Guillermo's like a second
father.

38:40.233 --> 38:42.000
Or a third father, after Ken.

38:42.033 --> 38:44.200
- I guess not everybody
is the same in the family.

38:44.233 --> 38:46.600
- So when he's poking small,
little jabs at me

38:46.633 --> 38:48.467
it feels just like, you know,
a knife going right

38:48.500 --> 38:49.533
into my heart.

38:52.767 --> 38:54.266
- Thank you so much.
- I got to go back, too,

38:54.300 --> 38:56.133
and I'm still looking for DJ.

39:03.133 --> 39:04.233
- James.

39:04.266 --> 39:06.066
- Dude, I'm crying every day.

39:06.100 --> 39:08.533
I'm just not happy right now,
you know?

39:08.567 --> 39:11.600
It feels like someone
that was once proud of me

39:11.633 --> 39:13.633
is just no longer proud
of me anymore.

39:16.266 --> 39:17.567
- You all right, bro?
You work hard--

39:17.600 --> 39:19.033
- So hard, man.
- I know, bro.

39:19.066 --> 39:20.333
You work hard, mate.
- ----ing hell.

39:20.367 --> 39:22.767
- It's all right.
You made a couple mistakes,

39:23.000 --> 39:24.667
bro, but you're all right.
- It just sucks

39:24.700 --> 39:26.233
when he says that to me.
- You work hard. I know,

39:26.266 --> 39:27.734
James. I know.
- It's ----ing heartbreaking.

39:27.767 --> 39:29.633
- I know. I know.
- Everyone's been saying--

39:29.667 --> 39:31.166
- But you know you need
that a little bit, right?

39:31.200 --> 39:32.633
A little bit of tough love,
you know?

39:32.667 --> 39:34.000
You know?

39:34.033 --> 39:35.734
Thank you so much
for your time...

39:35.767 --> 39:37.567
- You're welcome, of course.
- All right. Thank you so much.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.133
- Keep that head up, okay?
- Yeah. I'll see you soon.

39:39.166 --> 39:41.000
Thank you again.
- Yep.

39:41.033 --> 39:42.300
- Good job, all right?
- Thank you for everything.

39:42.333 --> 39:44.133
I love you.

39:46.700 --> 39:48.734
- I'll take
an orange slice too.

39:48.767 --> 39:50.333
Girls, we're going to explore.

39:50.367 --> 39:54.367
We're gonna hit up
a few wineries. Girls' trip.

39:54.400 --> 39:56.300
- I just love how all these
buildings look like

39:56.333 --> 39:58.633
little cottages.
Like, every single one.

39:58.667 --> 40:00.100
- That's what I love
about California,

40:00.133 --> 40:02.266
is that lavender
and rosemary just grow.

40:02.300 --> 40:04.266
- Is that really real lavender?
Oh, wait. That is lavender.

40:04.300 --> 40:06.066
Yeah, she's right.

40:06.100 --> 40:08.633
- Oh, that smells so good.
- What if it's poisonous?

40:08.667 --> 40:11.266
- No, it's not.
It's just lavender. Look.

40:11.300 --> 40:14.633
- That's really cool.
- Kristen, what have you done

40:14.667 --> 40:16.600
with the flowers?
- It's just lavender.

40:16.633 --> 40:18.767
- Even little kids know
not to pick up

40:19.000 --> 40:21.233
an unidentified plant
and eat it.

40:21.266 --> 40:24.033
- You guys, now I'm scared.
Did I eat something poisonous?

40:24.066 --> 40:27.667
- There's definitely ----ing
dog pee on that plant.

40:27.700 --> 40:30.367
- We're going in the windmill.
- Oh!

40:30.400 --> 40:32.600
- Ooh.
- Pretty.

40:32.633 --> 40:34.300
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:34.333 --> 40:37.166
- Welcome to CrossHatch Winery.
- Is this just lavender?

40:37.200 --> 40:39.033
'Cause I ate it.
- Uh, I don't know what that...

40:40.734 --> 40:43.200
- It's outside.
- It looks like sage.

40:43.233 --> 40:46.166
- Oh, I promise
we're sophisticated.

40:46.200 --> 40:48.166
- We have one white that
we're tasting right now.

40:48.200 --> 40:50.333
Our CrossHatch Tone.

40:51.767 --> 40:54.300
So this is merlot.
- I don't like really dry red

40:54.333 --> 40:56.166
wines where, like, I'm like--
- Yeah.

40:56.200 --> 40:57.700
It's not real fruit forward-y.

40:57.734 --> 40:59.734
- I think merlot is
a basic bitch of wine.

40:59.767 --> 41:01.600
- Okay, um..

41:01.633 --> 41:03.100
- Ugh.

41:03.133 --> 41:04.734
Kristen, we're wine tasting.

41:04.767 --> 41:08.033
It's supposed to be a classy,
sort of elegant thing

41:08.066 --> 41:10.400
with your pinky up...

41:10.433 --> 41:13.200
and this is the first winery
of the day.

41:13.233 --> 41:15.300
- Let's keep this train moving.

41:17.200 --> 41:18.734
- It doesn't actually
look like Copenhagen--

41:18.767 --> 41:21.133
like, ----ing fix it.

41:21.166 --> 41:24.200
- Get a hold of yourself.
- All right. Let's do this.

41:24.233 --> 41:26.633
- Oh, it feels good in here.
Hello.

41:26.667 --> 41:29.200
- Hello. How are you?

41:29.233 --> 41:31.033
- Fantastic. How are you?
- Good.

41:31.066 --> 41:33.734
Welcome to Carivintas.
So tasting for everybody?

41:33.767 --> 41:35.700
- Yes, please.
- Yes?

41:37.367 --> 41:39.667
- Cheers.

41:41.433 --> 41:43.166
This is good.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.100
- Really?
- I like wine.

41:45.133 --> 41:47.400
I just--my trainer
doesn't like me to drink it.

41:47.433 --> 41:49.200
- Okay, so what's
your drink of choice?

41:49.233 --> 41:51.100
- Tito's and soda with lemon.

41:51.133 --> 41:52.767
- All my friends are...
- Or just straight tequila.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.767
- Basic bitches with
their Tito's and soda.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.667
- I know.
- You smell lovely.

41:58.367 --> 42:00.200
- You smell the lavender.
- There are telltale signs

42:00.233 --> 42:02.233
that crazy Kristen
is about to come out.

42:02.266 --> 42:04.200
She starts exhibiting
weird behavior.

42:04.233 --> 42:06.000
- Thank you.

42:06.033 --> 42:07.467
- And then she starts
rambling on about things

42:07.500 --> 42:09.767
that you have
no idea what she's saying.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.400
- We'll take another bottle.
Ooh.

42:13.433 --> 42:15.667
- And drinking. A lot.

42:21.133 --> 42:23.066
- Where's our home girl?

42:23.100 --> 42:24.367
- She's on one.

42:24.400 --> 42:25.500
Crazy Kristen?

42:25.533 --> 42:27.333
She's not coming.
She's here.

42:30.767 --> 42:33.133
- Next time on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

42:33.166 --> 42:34.734
- Peter met some girl.

42:34.767 --> 42:36.467
- Are you trying to say
that hos are in the hotel?

42:38.533 --> 42:41.400
- Put them on FaceTime,
and I will tell them to go.

42:41.433 --> 42:43.266
- Here we go. Here we go.

42:43.300 --> 42:45.266
- Your brother hasn't set
the best example.

42:45.300 --> 42:47.300
- I'm my own person,
and I've proved that.

42:47.333 --> 42:49.100
- Well, you haven't proved
it yet.

42:49.133 --> 42:51.233
- I heard that you
and Adam went to Bang Town.

42:51.266 --> 42:52.767
- I'm not talking about Adam
with you guys.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.100
- There's plenty of stuff
we can already, like,

42:54.133 --> 42:56.000
talk sh-- about.

42:56.033 --> 42:57.200
- Sit down. Sit down.
- No!

42:57.233 --> 42:59.100
- Sit your ass
----ing down right now.

42:59.133 --> 43:00.400
- Bye.
- Okay.

43:00.433 --> 43:03.133
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Wow. Here we go.

43:03.166 --> 43:06.233

Rules," go bravotv.com.
