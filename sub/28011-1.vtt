10:06.398 --> 10:08.859
I know. I was there.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.862
But her ship had tech
that could find Inhumans

10:11.945 --> 10:13.822
and Quake's tracking program
taps directly

10:13.906 --> 10:15.908
into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s satellite network.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.534
If we merge them,

10:17.701 --> 10:20.412
we can find every Inhuman
on the planet.

good riddance,

Hala's ship from the water,

Tony Stark grabbed anything
in reach and stashed it away

20:33.859 --> 20:34.985
Oh?

20:36.570 --> 20:38.488
SQUIRREL GIRL: Vegan donuts!
Mm.

20:38.572 --> 20:40.324
-Awesome.
-(CHITTERS)

20:40.407 --> 20:43.702
The best vegan donuts on the
upper-middle-lower-eastside.

20:44.703 --> 20:46.705
Heard what you did fighting
those crazies, kiddo.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.040
I was wrong about you.

20:48.415 --> 20:49.416
Thank you,

20:49.499 --> 20:51.376
and I was wrong
about these donuts.

20:51.627 --> 20:53.837
You live, you learn.

20:53.962 --> 20:55.464
Hey, speaking of living,

20:55.547 --> 20:57.049
I'm happy to have you
on the team,

20:57.132 --> 20:59.134
but you know you still
have to go home, right?

20:59.343 --> 21:00.969
You have to face your dad.

21:01.053 --> 21:03.388
My dad may be a little
easier on Ghost Spider,

21:03.472 --> 21:06.058
but Gwen hasn't
been home in a while.

21:06.141 --> 21:08.185
He's not gonna
forgive me for that.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.521
Gwen, parents don't call kids
every day for weeks

21:10.604 --> 21:11.813
just to yell at them.

21:13.732 --> 21:15.359
If I'm wrong, we'll hang up.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.735
I'll be right here.

21:21.949 --> 21:24.952
(LINE RINGING)

21:29.164 --> 21:32.167
Hi.
Dad?

21:33.210 --> 21:36.129
