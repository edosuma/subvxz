into the lagoon.

got tangled in his leg

out of the blowhole,

Hey! What you doing here?

58:39.683 --> 58:40.749
I'm looking for someone.

58:41.285 --> 58:42.751
I'm someone.

58:42.753 --> 58:44.086
What do you want? I got...

58:45.723 --> 58:47.055
Oh, no. A girl.

58:47.057 --> 58:48.257
We got girls.

58:48.259 --> 58:49.591
A young girl.

58:51.028 --> 58:52.995
All our girls are young, <i> chico.</i>

58:52.997 --> 58:55.731
Really young.
Like, ten years old.

59:00.604 --> 59:02.604
No, no, no!
She's from my neighborhood.

59:02.606 --> 59:04.039
She's a neighbor.
I'm looking after her.

59:04.041 --> 59:06.808
I'm looking after her.
Just looking after her.

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:14.343
Wait for me, stay in the car,

01:00:14.345 --> 01:00:15.644
I'll be right there.

This car was stolen.
It's my car.

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:01.957
Somebody stole my car
and brought it over here.

01:01:01.959 --> 01:01:03.225
I want my car back.

Sir...

...you have my <i> papi</i> 's car.

01:01:25.783 --> 01:01:27.215
I know the crisis
is affecting us all

01:01:27.217 --> 01:01:29.051
in so many ways right now,

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:33.188
but since my older brothers
left the island,

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:35.457
and my mother passed,

01:01:35.458 --> 01:01:37.725
my <i> papi </i> has had to raise me
all by himself.

01:01:37.728 --> 01:01:39.461
And all the time,
he has had to carry on

01:01:39.463 --> 01:01:41.797
cleaning gas station toilets.

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:45.067
I've spent my life in that car.

01:01:45.069 --> 01:01:46.702
That car is my home.

01:01:47.771 --> 01:01:49.838
Please, <i> señor,</i>
don't destroy it.

01:01:54.445 --> 01:01:56.044
[man tapping]

01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:59.948
Okay, I'll give you 400 cash,
right now.

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:06.054
Maybe you should start
buying and selling used cars.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.159
Are you at least gonna thank me?

01:02:29.046 --> 01:02:30.479
[Rafa] Come on,
get out of the car.

01:02:30.481 --> 01:02:32.147
-Get out of the car.
-[Ana] Now what?

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:35.083
Come on, come here.

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:36.485
What do you want me
to thank you for, huh?

01:02:36.487 --> 01:02:37.686
Breaking into my car

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:38.886
and then causing me
to lose my stock?

01:02:38.889 --> 01:02:40.489
Oh, sure,
like that one's on me now.

01:02:40.491 --> 01:02:42.224
Or maybe I should thank you

01:02:42.225 --> 01:02:43.958
for almost getting beaten up
or maybe killed

01:02:43.961 --> 01:02:46.194
because I went into the <i> barrio</i>
looking for you,

01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:48.029
and some thugs
thought I was a pervert.

01:02:48.031 --> 01:02:49.498
-A what?
-[Rafa] A pervert!

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.032
A pervert! Forget it!

01:02:51.034 --> 01:02:53.235
Listen, I'm done going

01:02:53.237 --> 01:02:55.504
throughout this island
acting like a babysitter.

01:02:55.506 --> 01:02:57.773
I know you don't take
responsibility for any--

01:02:57.775 --> 01:02:59.241
Okay, watch me
take responsibility.

01:02:59.243 --> 01:03:01.543
-Let's go.
-Wait!

01:03:01.545 --> 01:03:03.178
-Stop it!
-Come on, let's go. Come on!

-Stop!
-Come on.

-Let go!
-Let's go.

01:03:05.698 --> 01:03:07.181
Come on, I'll show you
a little responsibility.

-[Rafa] Come on.

01:03:08.852 --> 01:03:11.253

is gonna look after you.

'Cause, frankly, right now,
I can't help you anymore.

01:03:19.196 --> 01:03:21.830
And if you're lucky, you're
gonna find some help in there.

01:03:21.832 --> 01:03:23.098
Now, go.

01:03:26.003 --> 01:03:27.335
Fine, you don't think
you need help?

01:03:29.907 --> 01:03:31.173
Well, I do.

[Helen] ¶ <i> Hallelujah </i> ¶

01:03:53.297 --> 01:03:54.963
The gospel tells us

01:03:54.965 --> 01:03:56.998
that Jesus addresses
each individual

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.167
he encounters,
whether rich or poor,

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:02.103
in terms
of their common humanity,

01:04:02.606 --> 01:04:05.841
not in terms
of their bank accounts.

01:04:05.843 --> 01:04:08.376
Reminds me of one
my favorites, John 12.

01:04:08.378 --> 01:04:11.880
We heard how Mary
took an expensive ointment

01:04:11.882 --> 01:04:14.049
to anoint the feet of Jesus.

01:04:14.051 --> 01:04:17.319
"But why was this ointment
not sold for 300 denarii

01:04:17.321 --> 01:04:18.854
and given to the poor?"

01:04:18.856 --> 01:04:20.322
asked his disciples accusingly.

01:04:20.991 --> 01:04:22.591
Despite their protest,

01:04:22.593 --> 01:04:26.027
Jesus received the gift

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:28.463
well worth a year's wages
for most people.

01:04:29.132 --> 01:04:33.602
This is the same Jesus
who was born in a stall,

01:04:33.604 --> 01:04:37.906
the same Jesus
who died on a trash heap.

01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:43.011
What does this
tell us about our Lord?

01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:47.116
It tells us

01:04:47.117 --> 01:04:48.884
that Jesus
in His infinite wisdom,

01:04:48.886 --> 01:04:51.152
His infinite wisdom,

01:04:51.154 --> 01:04:54.089
a wisdom that is
sometimes perplexing,

01:04:54.091 --> 01:04:56.157
yet always greater than ours,

01:04:56.159 --> 01:05:00.161
allowed us
to enjoy the fruits of our labor

01:05:00.163 --> 01:05:01.363
while still on earth.

01:05:01.365 --> 01:05:03.298
[crowd] Amen.

01:05:04.201 --> 01:05:07.335
[Helen] I'm only here with you
a limited time,

01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:10.405
but let me be an example

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:14.643
of what one can achieve
through God's blessing.

01:05:14.645 --> 01:05:17.345
-Can I hear "amen"?
-Amen!

01:05:17.347 --> 01:05:20.682
[Helen] The crisis
that He has sent this island,

01:05:20.684 --> 01:05:24.252
we all share together,
is His will.

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:25.220
[crowd] Amen!

01:05:25.222 --> 01:05:26.354
[Helen] He knows.

01:05:26.356 --> 01:05:28.123
He knows we struggle.

01:05:28.125 --> 01:05:30.125
While across the water

01:05:30.127 --> 01:05:32.127
we imagine the wealth of others.

01:05:32.129 --> 01:05:34.195
[crowd] Amen.

01:05:34.197 --> 01:05:37.666
[Helen] This is God's challenge
to the people of Puerto Rico,

01:05:37.668 --> 01:05:40.235
a challenge we shall overcome.

01:05:40.237 --> 01:05:41.169
[crowd] Amen.

01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:42.170
[Helen] Amen.

01:05:42.172 --> 01:05:43.572
[crowd] Amen.

01:05:43.573 --> 01:05:44.973
[Helen] And remember, remember.

01:05:45.409 --> 01:05:48.143
The more we all give,

01:05:48.145 --> 01:05:49.377
the more we receive.

01:05:49.379 --> 01:05:50.378
-[crowd] Hallelujah!
-Amen.

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.347
[crowd] Amen.

01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:54.950
-Amen!
-[crowd] Amen.

01:05:59.056 --> 01:06:00.088
In a church?

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:02.023
Are you out of your mind?

01:06:02.025 --> 01:06:03.291
Oh, in case you forgot.

01:06:04.728 --> 01:06:06.695
You don't think I could've taken
care of all that by now

01:06:06.697 --> 01:06:07.996
if I hadn't been stuck with you?

01:06:07.998 --> 01:06:09.297
-Stuck with me?
[Rafa] Yes.

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:11.132
You're showing
some hustle around here.

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:12.434
[man] Excuse me, sir?

01:06:15.205 --> 01:06:16.504
[man] Four hundred and ten,

01:06:16.506 --> 01:06:18.039
four hundred and forty,

01:06:18.041 --> 01:06:19.174
four hundred and fifty,

01:06:19.176 --> 01:06:20.709
four hundred and fifty five,

01:06:20.711 --> 01:06:22.177
four hundred and sixty,

01:06:22.179 --> 01:06:23.445
four hundred and seventy...

01:06:23.447 --> 01:06:25.180
[Helen]
Either I just saw somebody

01:06:25.182 --> 01:06:26.715
pretending they couldn't walk

01:06:26.717 --> 01:06:30.051
taking money
from good church-going people

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:33.722
or I'm witnessing a miracle.

01:06:33.724 --> 01:06:34.556
Which is it?

01:06:35.459 --> 01:06:36.992
Miracle?

01:06:38.395 --> 01:06:40.762
As a pastor, it is my duty

01:06:40.764 --> 01:06:42.263
to try to help you
and your daughter.

01:06:42.265 --> 01:06:43.999
Oh, he's not my dad.

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:48.336
What is your relationship
to this child?

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:49.604
-Uncle.
-Neighbor.

01:06:50.273 --> 01:06:52.207
A neighbor
who tries to sell cars.

01:06:52.209 --> 01:06:53.341
I'm more like a family friend.

01:06:54.011 --> 01:06:55.443
No, just neighbor.

01:06:55.445 --> 01:06:57.379
Ana would like to apologize.

01:06:58.081 --> 01:06:59.347
Yes, I'm sure she would.

01:07:00.117 --> 01:07:01.182
I'm sorry.

01:07:02.085 --> 01:07:03.518
The church teaches forgiveness.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.353
And penance.

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:06.588
Fraud is a serious matter.

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.224
[chuckling]
Obviously, she's gonna--

01:07:09.226 --> 01:07:10.458
She's gonna give back the money.

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:13.028
And perhaps a small atonement
could be made,

01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:15.430
if, say, she did a little work
at the church.

01:07:16.166 --> 01:07:18.066
Well, we'd be happy to come back
another time,

01:07:18.068 --> 01:07:19.167
but right now

01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:21.503
I'm kind of in a crisis.

01:07:21.505 --> 01:07:23.338
Or we could call the police.

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:28.209
[door opens]

01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:30.545
[door closes]

01:07:34.251 --> 01:07:35.784
Thank you.

01:07:35.786 --> 01:07:37.185
[Ana] Welcome.

01:07:40.057 --> 01:07:42.123
It's good being on the road.

01:07:42.125 --> 01:07:43.358
Isn't it?

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.193
Why don't we stay here

01:07:45.195 --> 01:07:47.228
and never go back to San Juan?

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.466
You should bring your sons here.

01:07:53.203 --> 01:07:54.569
It'd be really nice.

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:56.087
They have a busy life.

01:07:56.088 --> 01:07:57.604
They have family,
they have kids.

01:07:59.142 --> 01:08:00.408
What are their names?

01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:03.244
Nicolás

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:05.080
and Andrés.

01:08:05.082 --> 01:08:06.347
Why don't you see them?

01:08:09.219 --> 01:08:11.186
You can just get
a flight to Miami

01:08:11.188 --> 01:08:12.687
or get them to get a flight.

01:08:16.393 --> 01:08:17.392
Cheers.

to share her life experiences

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:57.198

accept God's choices for her.

01:09:03.206 --> 01:09:04.471
All right, Ana.

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:06.207
I want you to tell the story

01:09:06.209 --> 01:09:08.243
exactly as we discussed

01:09:08.245 --> 01:09:09.877
about how the church and prayer

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.747
has helped you live
with your disability, okay?

01:09:18.455 --> 01:09:20.354
Thank you, Pastor Helen.

01:09:20.357 --> 01:09:22.689
My name is Zuleika,

01:09:22.692 --> 01:09:24.559
and this is my story.

01:09:25.295 --> 01:09:27.395
When I was five,
my father became a drunk

01:09:27.397 --> 01:09:29.330
and pushed me down some stairs.

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:30.631
I broke my legs.

01:09:31.568 --> 01:09:33.368
They told me
I would never walk again.

01:09:33.904 --> 01:09:35.170
A few days ago,

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:36.470
I met a kind man.

01:09:37.174 --> 01:09:38.939
That's him right there.

01:09:38.942 --> 01:09:41.609
[whispering]

01:09:41.611 --> 01:09:44.444
[Ana] He'd lost everything
through his misguided behavior.

01:09:44.447 --> 01:09:46.247
He was a heavy gambler,

01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:47.948
and he took tablets
for his vagina.

01:09:47.951 --> 01:09:50.318
[laughter]

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:52.487
But he told me
the story of Saint Tino.

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:56.658
One day, Tino was leading
his cow beside a small lagoon

01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:58.726
and the cow slipped on a rock
and fell in,

01:09:59.396 --> 01:10:01.196
pulling Tino with him.

01:10:02.399 --> 01:10:04.232
Tino thought he would drown.

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:09.304
So he put his hands together
and said a prayer.

01:10:12.943 --> 01:10:16.211
Tino stood up and was amazed
to see that he could walk again.

01:10:16.513 --> 01:10:18.613
A few days ago,
I went there myself

01:10:19.282 --> 01:10:21.482
and I gently dipped my legs in,

01:10:21.952 --> 01:10:23.484
and I said a prayer.

01:10:31.628 --> 01:10:35.396
[gasping]

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:36.531
Oh, my God.

01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:39.500
[applause]

01:10:53.617 --> 01:10:56.384
[Helen] What an amazing story.

01:10:56.386 --> 01:10:57.518
Gentlemen.

01:10:57.988 --> 01:11:00.321
Open your hearts, everybody.

01:11:00.323 --> 01:11:01.990
Tell your friends and family

01:11:01.992 --> 01:11:04.993
about what you have seen
and heard today.

01:11:04.995 --> 01:11:09.597
Bring them to our church to hear
this miracle for themselves.

01:11:17.507 --> 01:11:19.707
[Ana] If we get ten percent
for every atonement,

01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:21.643
we can pay Diego on time,

01:11:21.644 --> 01:11:23.578
and I bet I can get her
to raise our cut.

01:11:31.554 --> 01:11:33.755
We're just trying to make it
through the crisis, Rafa.

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:39.460
[sad song plays]

01:11:56.046 --> 01:11:57.645
Come on, let's go. Bedtime.

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:58.613
Good night.

01:12:00.083 --> 01:12:01.316
[Rafa] Ana!

01:12:02.519 --> 01:12:04.319
[Ana] My name is Zuleika,

01:12:05.088 --> 01:12:06.654
and this is my story.

01:12:07.457 --> 01:12:09.724
When I was five,
my father became a drunk

01:12:09.726 --> 01:12:11.859
and, in one
of his drunken rages,

01:12:11.861 --> 01:12:13.795
he pushed me down the stairs.

01:12:13.797 --> 01:12:15.463
I broke my backbone.

01:12:15.865 --> 01:12:18.399
They told me
I would never walk again.

01:12:18.401 --> 01:12:21.636
Until a few days ago, when I
heard the story of Saint Tino,

01:12:21.638 --> 01:12:24.505
a crippled farmer who thought
God had forsaken him

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:27.408
because he was poor
and he couldn't walk well.

01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:29.877
One day, Tino was walking
his favorite cow

01:12:29.879 --> 01:12:32.113
beside a small lagoon

01:12:32.115 --> 01:12:34.615
when the cow slipped on a rock
and fell in,

01:12:34.617 --> 01:12:37.418
pulling Tino with him
into the dark depths.

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:40.088
Tino thought he would drown
because the cow was sinking,

01:12:40.090 --> 01:12:42.557
so he tried to swim,
but he didn't have enough air.

01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:46.094
So then he put his hands
together, he said a prayer.

01:12:46.096 --> 01:12:49.564
And suddenly, the waters
of the well rose up.

01:12:49.566 --> 01:12:51.699
Whoosh...

01:12:51.701 --> 01:12:53.868
And placed him gently
on the grass,

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:56.738
as if God's hands
are made out of water.

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:01.843
[Rafa] Camila!
Wait, let me explain.

01:13:01.845 --> 01:13:04.712
After hearing that story,
I was inspired.

01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:06.514
My friend took me there.

01:13:06.516 --> 01:13:08.716
Using a child to make money?

01:13:09.519 --> 01:13:10.818
No. Listen.

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:13.121
Embezzling? From a church?

01:13:13.123 --> 01:13:14.422
I'm not embezzling from them.

01:13:14.424 --> 01:13:15.590
It's more complicated than that!

01:13:15.592 --> 01:13:18.159
I used to have
feelings for you, Rafael.

01:13:18.161 --> 01:13:21.462
I said a prayer and...

01:13:22.866 --> 01:13:24.832

01:13:24.834 --> 01:13:28.636
[applause]

01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:35.476
Now I understand
why your business went bad.

01:13:35.478 --> 01:13:36.677
Because you're a crook.

01:13:37.147 --> 01:13:38.146
Because you are a crook!

01:13:38.148 --> 01:13:39.747
Listen. Hey! Hey!

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:40.882
Camila.

01:14:36.005 --> 01:14:36.904

01:14:36.906 --> 01:14:38.239
Sir.

01:14:38.241 --> 01:14:38.973
Hey!

01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:40.541
We're done here.

01:14:40.543 --> 01:14:41.742
That's it. We're done.

01:14:41.744 --> 01:14:42.777
Ana. Leave that.

01:14:42.779 --> 01:14:43.878
Hey. Hey. Leave that.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:44.912
Let's go. We're out of here.

01:14:44.914 --> 01:14:47.949
You wanna call the police?
Go ahead. Call the police.

01:14:47.951 --> 01:14:49.750
'Cause what you're doing here
is not only fraud,

01:14:49.752 --> 01:14:51.819
you're taking advantage of
people who don't have anything

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:54.555
which is exactly what's wrong
with this island right now.

01:14:54.557 --> 01:14:57.225
People like you coming in
and taking advantage.

01:14:57.227 --> 01:14:58.092
And where are you from?

01:14:59.963 --> 01:15:01.229
I'm from San Juan.

01:15:01.231 --> 01:15:03.564
-But you're not Puerto Rican.
-I'm from Miami.

01:15:03.566 --> 01:15:05.633
-[Helen] Oh, yeah? Miami-Cuban?
-Yes!

01:15:05.635 --> 01:15:07.235
So you probably came here
to sell cars

01:15:07.237 --> 01:15:09.103
because of
the Puerto Rican tax breaks?

01:15:10.807 --> 01:15:12.907
I came here
for many reasons. Ana.

01:15:12.909 --> 01:15:14.876
But you came here with the hope
of making more money

01:15:14.878 --> 01:15:16.043
and paying less taxes.

01:15:16.045 --> 01:15:17.645
So isn't that taking advantage?

01:15:17.647 --> 01:15:18.880
[Ana] Look, Rafa.

01:15:18.882 --> 01:15:20.882
Helen's given me a great job.

01:15:20.884 --> 01:15:24.051
You never know how much money
there is inside this.

01:15:25.622 --> 01:15:28.256
Ana has decided she wants
to stay with the church

01:15:28.258 --> 01:15:29.857
for our summer camp.

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:30.858
Oh, Ana's decided?

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.059
Yes, she has.

01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:46.532
-Come on, baby.
-I'm so done.

01:41:46.534 --> 01:41:47.600
-Come on.
-So many times.

01:42:07.455 --> 01:42:09.422
Yeah, there you go, tough guy.

01:42:11.226 --> 01:42:13.292
Yeah.

01:42:13.294 --> 01:42:15.161
Looks like your mom's
cleaning house.

01:42:15.163 --> 01:42:16.129
[Ana] Yeah.

01:42:17.198 --> 01:42:18.498
[Rafa] You're not done
with this car yet?

01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:20.299
What's the matter with you?
Come on, let's go.

01:42:21.202 --> 01:42:22.235
Let's go, slowpoke.

01:42:23.304 --> 01:42:24.470
Get a move on.

01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:26.472
Show me some hustle.

01:42:26.474 --> 01:42:28.341
I'll show you some hustle!

01:42:28.343 --> 01:42:29.342
[Rafa laughs]

01:42:29.344 --> 01:42:31.144
This enough hustle?

01:42:31.146 --> 01:42:33.279
-Come on!
-I'll hustle you up.

01:42:33.281 --> 01:42:35.248
I'll give you
something to hustle!

01:43:16.457 --> 01:43:17.490
You know what you need?

01:43:17.492 --> 01:43:18.658
You need a car.

01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:19.926
A cool car,

01:43:19.928 --> 01:43:21.460
a second-hand car

01:43:21.462 --> 01:43:23.563
from Rafa's Quality Cars.

01:43:23.565 --> 01:43:25.264
Name it, we have it!

01:43:25.266 --> 01:43:27.633
We got white cars, one owner.

01:43:27.635 --> 01:43:28.968
We got blue cars

01:43:28.970 --> 01:43:30.636
filled with half a tank of gas,

01:43:30.638 --> 01:43:32.205
four-nine-nine-five.

01:43:32.207 --> 01:43:34.273
We got SUVs, like new,

01:43:34.275 --> 01:43:36.409
nine-nine-three-nine.

01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:38.544
So many cars, we don't know
what to do with them.

01:43:38.546 --> 01:43:41.347
They're cheap,
they're old, they're classic.

01:43:41.349 --> 01:43:43.649
I can wash it for you,
but I can't drive it.

01:43:43.651 --> 01:43:45.218
I'm only eleven!

He doesn't just have
the coolest cars in Puerto Rico,

01:43:49.624 --> 01:43:52.592
but he is the nicest guy,
and you can trust him.

01:43:52.594 --> 01:43:55.394
That's my promise to you.

01:43:55.964 --> 01:43:56.963
