12:41.427 --> 12:44.221
Sorry, Reg.
I got a message from the future.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.598
What future?

12:45.681 --> 12:49.852
My future self told me very explicitly

12:49.935 --> 12:51.604
not to save this world.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.439
[laughing]

12:53.522 --> 12:56.108
You are an arrogant
son of a bitch, aren't you?

12:56.734 --> 12:58.110
"Future you."

12:58.194 --> 12:59.528
"Present you."

12:59.612 --> 13:02.573
The past is
as much a mystery as the future.

13:04.742 --> 13:08.120
You ruined your life once before
by not listening to me.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.247
Are you prepared to do that again?

13:11.999 --> 13:13.125
[Five sighs]

13:14.001 --> 13:16.420
Fine, I'll attend your stupid meeting.

13:16.504 --> 13:17.463
Excellent!

13:17.546 --> 13:18.589
If

13:19.340 --> 13:23.135
you tell me what happened
with you in the Buffalo Suite last night.

13:23.219 --> 13:26.263
Who were you talking to?
Was it Klaus? Was it Ben?

13:26.347 --> 13:27.723
No one. I was alone.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.935
Though I doubt
you were in any condition to remember.

13:31.018 --> 13:33.604
We should go.
Don't want to be late for the meeting.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.732
I would move if I were you.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.818
-What, are you threatening me?
-[rumbling]

13:40.820 --> 13:42.112
Shall we?

13:58.295 --> 14:00.881
-[Klaus] Woo! Five! Yeah!
-[all cheering]

14:00.965 --> 14:02.299
[cheering and whistling]

14:02.383 --> 14:04.301
-Here he is!
-Yeah!

14:04.385 --> 14:07.054
-That speech last night! Wow!
-[Luther] Whoa!

14:07.137 --> 14:09.265
Brought me to tears, you big softy.

14:09.348 --> 14:13.727
I especially liked when you referred to us
as a family bound by destiny and love.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.437
-Yes. That was great.
-Okay. Enough.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.147
It was the booze talking.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.775
In the light of day,
you're all still deplorable.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.694
[Reginald]
And your day's about to get worse.

14:22.820 --> 14:26.031
The Norse had seven sleepers.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.660
The Blackfoot, seven stars.

14:30.411 --> 14:33.622
As a boy,
I heard the legend of the seven bells.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.749
All these stories are the same.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.878
The village is under threat
by flood, by fire,

14:38.961 --> 14:40.880
by a night that never ends.

14:41.422 --> 14:44.633
A shaman brings his disciples
to a sacred cave.

14:44.717 --> 14:48.762
He tells them
if they can ring the seven magic bells,

14:48.846 --> 14:53.434
the village will be saved,
and all will be restored just as it was.

14:55.686 --> 14:56.562
Reggie?

14:57.146 --> 14:59.106
Can we get a little less Brothers Grimm

14:59.189 --> 15:01.358
and more "What the hell does this
have to do with us?"

15:01.442 --> 15:03.861
There is a truth to these myths.

15:04.695 --> 15:07.072
None of you can deny
what's going on around us.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.075
All of existence
will be gone by the end of the day,

15:10.159 --> 15:13.954
but whoever or whatever
wove together space and time,

15:14.038 --> 15:16.707
they left a way
to put things back together

15:16.790 --> 15:19.877
if the universe
ever faced total annihilation.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.760
There is a portal in the universe.

15:27.843 --> 15:30.095
I built this hotel around it,

15:30.179 --> 15:31.513
and on the other side

15:32.389 --> 15:33.223
is the answer.

15:33.307 --> 15:36.477
[dramatic string music playing]

15:39.647 --> 15:41.398
And… we're supposed to, what?

15:41.482 --> 15:44.026
Just stroll in there,
ring some bells, and fix this shit?

15:44.109 --> 15:46.487
Sarcasm aside, you are mostly right.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.447
Except for the guardian.

15:48.530 --> 15:49.531
[loud clang]

15:50.824 --> 15:51.951
[gasps]

15:54.912 --> 15:57.247
-What kind of guardian?
-Kinda guardian that does this.

15:58.540 --> 16:01.001
-He had a sword.
-It is a force to be reckoned with.

16:01.085 --> 16:03.087
See? Yeah. This is where you lose me.

16:03.170 --> 16:06.340
This is where he loses you?
I checked out at the sacred cave.

16:06.423 --> 16:09.885
Why would the builders of this "back door"
need to have a guardian?

16:09.969 --> 16:13.681
Ah! To protect it from people
who want to use it for nefarious means.

16:13.764 --> 16:14.807
[Reginald] Correct, Sloane.

16:14.890 --> 16:18.060
So it's gonna take all of us
to defeat the thing protecting the bells.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.687
You're actually buying his crap?

16:19.770 --> 16:22.106
How is a guardian and bells any crazier

16:22.189 --> 16:24.733
than time-traveling briefcases
and assassins with cartoon masks?

16:24.817 --> 16:26.610
Actually, she's got you there.

16:33.701 --> 16:34.535
I'm in.

16:35.869 --> 16:37.371
I can't do this without you.

16:37.955 --> 16:38.831
[exhales softly]

16:40.207 --> 16:41.834
-Me too.
-Ow.

16:42.918 --> 16:44.253
Do we have a deal?

16:44.336 --> 16:46.380
But I think some of us should stay back.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.258
Like Lila.

16:49.341 --> 16:52.720
Uh… or you can stay, and I can go.

16:53.762 --> 16:57.057
No. This is much bigger than all of us.
Nobody can stay back.

16:57.141 --> 17:01.353
You, my children, are all that stands
between us and oblivion.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.896
Are we ready to go?

17:02.980 --> 17:04.106
Well, I say we vote.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.941
This isn't a democracy.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.359
Dad's calling the shots.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.695
I'm with Viktor. We vote.

17:09.778 --> 17:12.072
The world is ending,
and you want to count hands?

17:12.156 --> 17:13.532
You're asking us to risk our lives.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.826
I think it's only fair
you give us time to discuss it.

17:17.911 --> 17:18.746
Privately.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.417
[scoffs]

17:24.043 --> 17:27.004
-Why don't we meet back here in an hour?
-[Five] Agreed.

17:27.087 --> 17:29.089
-[Diego] Yeah, sure.
-[Lila] Whatever.

17:32.968 --> 17:37.056
"Lila should stay back."
Since when do you make decisions for me?

17:37.139 --> 17:39.725
-[Diego] I was just trying to make sure--
-Is this about the baby?

17:39.808 --> 17:41.935
Of course it's about the baby, all right?

17:42.019 --> 17:44.188
I go in there, I may die.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.941
But if we go in there, succeed,
and things go back to normal,

17:48.025 --> 17:49.985
I want you here with our baby.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.780
-I'm better in a fight than you are.
-First of all, no, you're not.

17:52.863 --> 17:55.741
And-- Whoa.
Lila, this isn't a contest, okay?

17:55.824 --> 17:57.534
We barely made it out last time, right?

17:57.618 --> 17:59.870
I thank God
that I was able to shut that door.

17:59.953 --> 18:03.290
Can you imagine being trapped
on the other side with him?

18:03.373 --> 18:05.125
I don't have to imagine. I was there.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.418
Good. So you'll stay.

18:06.502 --> 18:07.920
Not a chance. I'm going.

18:11.006 --> 18:12.466
Why can't I be right?

18:12.549 --> 18:14.384
Just… Just… Just once?

18:14.468 --> 18:15.385
[Lila sighs]

18:15.469 --> 18:16.678
Look, Diego,

18:17.221 --> 18:20.140
you said you choose me, right?

18:20.224 --> 18:23.310
Well, this is who I am.
I'm a fighter. Just like you.

18:23.393 --> 18:26.313
I only said that
because I thought you'd be nice to me.

18:28.690 --> 18:31.110
If you wanted nice,
you'd be with someone else.

18:35.989 --> 18:37.241

18:39.785 --> 18:40.744

18:40.828 --> 18:42.996
For what? So you can hand me my ass again?

18:43.080 --> 18:44.623
Look, I was really drunk last night.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.792
You don't have to make excuses. I get it.

18:46.875 --> 18:49.628
I am your least favorite sibling.
I ruined your life--

18:49.711 --> 18:51.255
Okay. No, that's not-- [sighs]

18:51.338 --> 18:53.465
Will you just stop and listen, please?

18:58.637 --> 18:59.847
Last night you were right.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.142
Claire and Ray are gone.

19:06.687 --> 19:10.190
But… hating you won't bring them back.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.193
And my pain…

19:15.279 --> 19:17.114
doesn't give me permission to hurt you.

19:17.197 --> 19:20.159
[thunder rumbling]

19:20.993 --> 19:22.369
[voice breaking] But it's real.

19:23.996 --> 19:27.374
And it's something that I have to carry.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.880
Which is why if I don't… [sniffles]

19:33.463 --> 19:37.801
[sighs] If I don't do something,
if I don't… if I don't act now…

19:41.847 --> 19:44.850
it's just another thing
that slips into nothingness.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.019
If we stay here,

19:48.687 --> 19:49.646
we die.

19:51.940 --> 19:55.694
But if we go through the portal, we could…
we could save the universe.

19:56.486 --> 19:59.114
We could save… everybody.

20:00.157 --> 20:03.827
So can we just put our past behind us
and move forward together?

20:05.996 --> 20:07.247
Can you give me that?

20:12.127 --> 20:13.086
[sighs]

20:14.296 --> 20:15.339
I love you.

[Five] Hey.

20:42.032 --> 20:43.700
Hey, how long do we have left?

20:44.284 --> 20:45.452
A couple hours.

20:45.535 --> 20:47.329
Could be more, could be less.

Where's Sloane?

for our end of the world party.

20:52.167 --> 20:54.253
So I guess you guys know
which way you're voting.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.213
You're more than welcome to join us.

20:56.296 --> 20:58.382
I'm still on the fence on that one.

20:58.465 --> 21:01.677
I saw something last night
that I was not supposed to see.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.053
Diego and Lila.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.889
Yeah, they do it on the stairs sometimes.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.683
No, I saw Dad.

21:07.766 --> 21:11.687
He was in his room with someone.
He was making some kind of deal.

21:11.770 --> 21:12.938
Before you ask,

21:13.021 --> 21:15.607
I don't know what the deal was
or who it was with.

There's something Dad's not telling us.

Think about it. When has the old man
ever been straight with us?

in our performance reviews.

[thunderclap]

24:49.779 --> 24:53.325
No, but we know
what we've got if we don't.

24:54.868 --> 24:56.870
We have to go into this together.

24:57.746 --> 24:58.747
Viktor.

24:59.456 --> 25:00.332
A family.

25:01.208 --> 25:04.586
You can't just keep
throwing the word "family" around.

25:04.669 --> 25:05.962
[Viktor] It isn't enough.

25:08.381 --> 25:09.591
I vote stay.

25:12.260 --> 25:13.094
Luther?

25:14.971 --> 25:15.972
Um…

25:17.307 --> 25:21.228
Sloane and I talked, and, well,

25:22.395 --> 25:23.396
we're out.

25:24.481 --> 25:27.150
Look, we wanna spend
whatever time we have left together,

25:27.234 --> 25:33.031
and not fighting some guy with a sword
and ringing bells and stuff.

25:33.990 --> 25:34.908
So…

25:35.867 --> 25:38.036
Well, dead even. Four in, four out.

25:39.829 --> 25:41.456
That leaves you, Number Five.

25:46.670 --> 25:51.174
I saw the future,
and it told me to sit this one out.

25:52.092 --> 25:53.385
I vote stay.

25:54.469 --> 25:56.221
It's time we accept our fate.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.685
[thunder rumbling]

26:05.897 --> 26:07.315
You're all pathetic.

26:07.399 --> 26:11.236
[somber string music playing]

26:12.153 --> 26:14.823
Why can't we go in there,
just the four of us?

26:15.323 --> 26:16.992
That would mean certain failure.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.868
[Reginald] There must be seven.

26:22.789 --> 26:23.790
Children,

26:25.500 --> 26:27.419
I can't say I'm happy with this.

26:29.170 --> 26:32.465
But I see now the blame falls on me.

26:34.634 --> 26:37.804
I failed you when you were young,
and I have failed you now.

26:39.598 --> 26:40.682
And in doing so,

26:40.765 --> 26:43.685
I have doomed the entire universe.

26:46.771 --> 26:49.774
If anyone needs me,
I'll be in the courtyard…

26:52.485 --> 26:53.945
awaiting the end.

26:57.657 --> 26:58.950
Idiots.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.872
Was that a real apology?

27:04.372 --> 27:06.625
The man's never apologized
for anything in his life.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.209
I actually feel bad for him.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.003
Don't worry. It'll pass.

27:13.548 --> 27:14.674
So now what?

27:14.758 --> 27:16.051
We wait for the end.

27:18.136 --> 27:21.014
See you around. It's been interesting.

27:22.015 --> 27:23.350
[thunderclap]

27:23.433 --> 27:25.477
[departing footsteps]

27:41.993 --> 27:43.078

27:48.625 --> 27:54.089
[sobbing]

27:54.172 --> 27:56.466
[inhales, sobs]

28:11.940 --> 28:13.316
[quietly] Oh, heck.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.236
[sighs]

28:16.945 --> 28:18.738
[hinge creaking]

28:21.408 --> 28:22.701
Hey, Dad.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.703
Krug 1968.

28:25.328 --> 28:26.496
Excellent year.

28:26.579 --> 28:29.624
Yeah. One last toast
with Sloane before, um…

28:30.125 --> 28:30.959
Hm.

28:31.042 --> 28:33.628
The ice machine was broken on our floor,
so I, you know…

28:33.712 --> 28:35.797
Hm. [sniffles]

28:36.589 --> 28:37.549
Are you okay?

28:37.632 --> 28:40.218
This is the failure of my life.

28:40.301 --> 28:41.261
[sighs]

28:41.344 --> 28:44.264
I sit here staring at centuries wasted,

28:44.347 --> 28:47.851
all because a different me
was unkind to his children.

28:49.477 --> 28:50.645
[Luther] Listen, Dad.

28:52.021 --> 28:54.315
It's not that simple, all right?

28:54.899 --> 28:57.777
You are so hard to say no to.

28:57.861 --> 28:58.737
You know that?

29:00.280 --> 29:01.448
But I had to.

29:01.531 --> 29:03.742
Luther, the universe
is tearing itself apart.

29:03.825 --> 29:07.412
Yes, I know, I know,
but it's always something, you know?

29:09.122 --> 29:10.874
I lived my whole life for you.

29:12.417 --> 29:15.003
Everything you ever
wanted me to do, I did.

29:16.921 --> 29:18.256
And I won't anymore.

29:21.217 --> 29:22.260
Nor should you.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.473
You're a remarkable man, Luther.

29:28.224 --> 29:30.143
Despite what I put you through,

29:31.853 --> 29:33.313
I hope that you can forgive me.

29:35.148 --> 29:36.149
Will you?

29:40.236 --> 29:42.489
Will you forgive me, son?

29:43.490 --> 29:46.284
[somber string music playing]

29:47.368 --> 29:48.369
Yeah.

29:50.747 --> 29:51.748
Yeah, of course.

29:51.831 --> 29:52.957
Thank you.

29:56.169 --> 29:57.170
Thank you.

30:00.673 --> 30:03.009
I only wish your self-actualization

30:03.092 --> 30:05.887
could have come
at a better time for the universe.

30:06.471 --> 30:07.972
I… I don't understand.

[dramatic string music swelling]

30:13.228 --> 30:16.981
[Luther choking]

30:19.150 --> 30:21.778
-Dad…
-There's an old saying, Luther.

30:22.403 --> 30:25.490
The best way to bring a family together
is at a wedding

30:26.282 --> 30:27.408
or a funeral.

30:28.451 --> 30:29.452
We tried the one.

30:30.203 --> 30:31.955
Now it's time for the other.

30:32.038 --> 30:33.122
[Luther groans]

30:34.749 --> 30:38.044
[choking]

30:43.049 --> 30:44.467
[weeping]

30:45.260 --> 30:47.846
Sloane… Sloane…

30:47.929 --> 30:49.514
I know, I know.

30:50.056 --> 30:52.976
Just as you found love.
It is a terrible shame.

30:54.352 --> 30:57.272
But don't worry.
I'll be sure to look after her.

30:57.355 --> 30:58.773
[shuddering] You…

31:06.948 --> 31:09.450
[choking]

31:09.534 --> 31:13.162
[somber string music playing]

31:23.047 --> 31:24.465
[sighs]

31:41.524 --> 31:42.650
[Viktor] What are you doing?

31:42.734 --> 31:44.986
Eating cereal. Retracing my steps.

31:45.653 --> 31:46.571
Why?

31:46.654 --> 31:48.781
The old man is hiding something.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.453
Yeah, feels like there's a lot of that
going around.

31:56.581 --> 31:59.626
-How do you mean?
-Allison apologized to me.

32:00.126 --> 32:02.337
Okay, and that's suspicious, how?

32:02.420 --> 32:05.340
Last night she was ready
to go ten rounds with me at the wedding,

32:05.423 --> 32:09.135
and this morning
it's all family and Dad and love.

32:09.218 --> 32:12.764
I don't know. Something must have happened
last night, but I don't know what.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.393
[metal clanging]

32:18.770 --> 32:20.146
[Reginald] There is no time.

32:21.105 --> 32:24.359
I can't do this without you.
Do we have a deal?

32:24.442 --> 32:26.569
[dramatic string music swelling]

32:26.653 --> 32:28.404
[Viktor] Five! Five! What?

32:28.488 --> 32:29.864
-It's Allison.
-What is?

32:29.948 --> 32:31.491
[Sloane screams] No!

32:35.662 --> 32:37.830
[sobbing]

32:41.334 --> 32:42.794
[Viktor] Oh my God, Luther.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.213
What happened?

32:45.296 --> 32:47.507
He went to go get ice. I couldn't--

32:47.590 --> 32:48.925
He didn't come back.

32:49.008 --> 32:51.052
[Sloane] I… I don't know.

32:51.135 --> 32:53.513
[Sloane weeping]

32:54.097 --> 32:56.224
It must have been him. The guardian.

32:57.016 --> 33:00.937
She's right. Whatever did this
had a long curved blade.

33:01.020 --> 33:02.730
How… How can you be sure?

33:02.814 --> 33:05.316
I don't know much, but I know knives.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.902
Children, what's going on? [gasps]

33:07.986 --> 33:09.696
Oh God! Luther.

33:09.779 --> 33:11.823
If we attacked first,
he would still be alive.

33:13.241 --> 33:17.036
[Sloane crying]

33:33.344 --> 33:35.596
We had a good run, old girl.

G-Guys? Hey, guys!

33:57.160 --> 33:58.995
[Sloane] What are we gonna do with Luther?

33:59.078 --> 34:01.205
Okay, we're out of time!
The Kugelblitz is here.

34:01.289 --> 34:02.957
Into the passage! It's the only way!

34:03.041 --> 34:04.083
You agreed to stay!

34:04.167 --> 34:05.585
They killed Luther, all right?

34:05.668 --> 34:07.503
-Come on, children! Hurry!
-We can't leave him.

34:07.587 --> 34:09.255
We go now, or we're gonna die.

34:09.338 --> 34:10.798
-No, God.
-[Allison] We have to go!

34:10.882 --> 34:12.091
-Come on.
-[Klaus] Hurry.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.926
-[Reginald] Children! Hurry, please!
-Come on!

34:14.010 --> 34:15.094
[Sloane sobbing]

34:15.178 --> 34:16.554
[Reginald] Go, go, go!

34:16.637 --> 34:19.015
-Come on! What are you waiting for?
-This isn't over!

34:19.932 --> 34:20.808
Get in the tunnel!

34:20.892 --> 34:22.101
Wait! What are you doing?

34:22.185 --> 34:24.812
You've done a fine job
bringing me back into the family fold.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.648
You're just more trouble
than you're worth. Sorry, Klaus.

34:27.732 --> 34:28.816
No, Dad!
