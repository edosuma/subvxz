Aw, scott baggs seems
really vulnerable right now.

00:30.239 --> 00:31.989
-That's hot.
-Hey, mr. Fisch.

00:32.116 --> 00:33.991
Hello, burger lady. Tiny people.

00:34.118 --> 00:35.075
-Hi.
-Hello.

00:35.161 --> 00:36.368
Bob. How are you, bob?

00:36.495 --> 00:37.828
Uh, good?

00:37.913 --> 00:39.663
Good, good, good.

00:39.749 --> 00:41.457
Uh, is this about the rent?

00:41.542 --> 00:43.417
Sorry, linda put
a smiley face on the check.

00:43.502 --> 00:45.836
I-I thought it was too much.
Was it too much?

00:45.963 --> 00:47.796
-Is that why you're here?
-No.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.506
-I enjoyed it.
-I knew it.

00:49.592 --> 00:51.008
What are you doing
this weekend, bob?

00:51.093 --> 00:53.052
Nothing fun or interesting
or cool, right?

00:53.137 --> 00:54.678
Uh, probably not. Why?

00:54.805 --> 00:56.346
Well, I need a private chef.

00:56.432 --> 00:58.724
For private cooking.
At a private location.

00:58.893 --> 01:01.143
And, yes,
you will need to sign this nda.

01:01.187 --> 01:02.811
Nda? "no ding-a-lings allowed"?

01:02.938 --> 01:05.314
Wait, are-are you asking me
to cater an event or something?

01:05.399 --> 01:07.399
-Yes. A camping event.
-Oh, camping.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.984
It's actually more
like fancy camping.

01:09.070 --> 01:11.904
"flancing," I call it, with,
let's just say,

01:11.989 --> 01:14.531
A secret club
of powerful members.

01:14.617 --> 01:15.741
A brotherhood, really.

01:15.868 --> 01:17.859
The blood oath was fun,
but messy.

01:17.912 --> 01:20.370
Mr. Fischoeder,
are you in the illuminati?

01:20.498 --> 01:22.247
You can tell us,
we're on the wait-list.

01:22.333 --> 01:23.499
Ha-ha. No.

01:23.626 --> 01:25.793
Those guys wish
they were in the babylon league.

01:25.878 --> 01:27.628
-The babalong league?
-Babylon.

01:27.713 --> 01:29.838
Like the ancient, uh, thing.

01:29.924 --> 01:31.215
Oh...

01:31.300 --> 01:32.674
Yes, a bunch of powerful men

01:32.802 --> 01:35.260
Letting our hair down
and picking the next president

01:35.387 --> 01:37.805
Over s'mores and cocktails
and naughty jokes.

01:37.890 --> 01:41.016
None of that makes me want to
take this catering gig. Sorry.

01:41.102 --> 01:42.434
Bob, I need you.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.937
I sort of kind of forgot
that we voted last year

01:45.022 --> 01:47.189
To each bring our own chefs
from now on

01:47.274 --> 01:49.608
Since everyone's got
their "dietary restrictions."

01:49.693 --> 01:51.318
And the other members
already picked over

01:51.403 --> 01:53.237
The best chefs in town,
so now I'm asking you.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.155
-Thank you?
-Name your price.

01:55.241 --> 01:56.115
-A billion dollars.
-No.

01:56.242 --> 01:57.449
-A million dollars.
-No.

01:57.535 --> 01:59.284
-A billion dollars.
-She just said that.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.245
How about $973?

02:01.372 --> 02:03.372
-That's very specific.
-It's the price

02:03.457 --> 02:04.832
For a new condenser
for the walk-in,

02:04.959 --> 02:06.917
Which apparently we need.
The one we have is

02:07.035 --> 02:09.128
Ready to go to that walk-in
in the sky.

02:09.213 --> 02:11.463
Right, I guess
ignoring that horrible sound

02:11.549 --> 02:12.673
Isn't gonna fix it.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.216
-Boring, but sold.
-Really?

02:14.301 --> 02:15.509
So, bob, do we have a deal?

02:15.594 --> 02:17.136
Uh, okay.

02:17.263 --> 02:18.679
-I guess I'll do it.
-Yay.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.347
Wait, they said there might
be a storm. Aren't you worried

02:20.432 --> 02:22.224
-About the weather?
-Y-you don't really need

02:22.351 --> 02:24.434
To worry about the weather
when you know the people I know.

02:24.562 --> 02:26.395
-They take care of all that.
-Wait, what?

02:26.564 --> 02:29.314
Oh, and bob, whip up
a custom cocktail, will you?

02:29.400 --> 02:31.441
It-it's kind of...
Part of the whole thing.

02:31.610 --> 02:32.985
Think refreshing, yet sour.

02:33.112 --> 02:36.780
-Manly, yet whimsical.
-Uh, a cocktail. Uh, okay.

02:36.866 --> 02:39.366
And gin. Lots of gin.
And call it something clever.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.243
The things we'll do
for a condenser.

02:41.328 --> 02:42.703
-I mean, you'll do.
-Yup.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.454
Okay, come aboard!

02:44.540 --> 02:46.498
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, put this on.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.709
-[bob] all right.
-Okay, now come aboard.

02:48.794 --> 02:51.128
[bob] but I have a blindfold on.
Uh, I can't see.

02:51.213 --> 02:53.839
[fischoeder]
you should've thought of that
before you put the blindfold on.

02:53.966 --> 02:55.632
[bob]
okay, I'll try-- ow.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.217
-[fischoeder] I don't know why
you stepped there.
-[bob] ow!

02:57.344 --> 02:58.886
[fischoeder]
you're bad at this.

02:59.597 --> 03:01.263
-No peeking.
-I'm not.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.432
-What? Speed up? Okay.
-Aah!

03:03.559 --> 03:04.725
No peeking!

03:04.852 --> 03:06.518
Can I take the blindfold off?

03:06.604 --> 03:09.438
I'd love to be able
to see things again.

03:09.565 --> 03:10.480
Eh, fine.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.943
Oh, my god, we're on a cliff.
Mr. Fischoeder, what if I fell?

03:15.029 --> 03:16.445
Well, that would've
been embarrassing for me.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.864
I'd be the idiot
whose chef fell off the cliff.

03:18.949 --> 03:22.743
So, my, uh, custom cocktail is,
uh, going in my mouth soon?

03:22.828 --> 03:25.704
Yeah. It was actually
kind of fun to come up with.

03:25.789 --> 03:28.081
I-I hope you like it.
It's gin and mint

03:28.167 --> 03:29.666
And a dash of pickle juice.

03:29.793 --> 03:33.003
I call it "the league
of ex-brine-inary gentlemint."

03:33.047 --> 03:35.756
Mmm... I think we should
call it the ring-a-ding.

03:35.841 --> 03:36.965
Mm, fine.

03:37.134 --> 03:38.550
Uh, you know,
I haven't had any reception

03:38.636 --> 03:39.760
Since we got to the island.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.136
Is there a place where I--

03:41.263 --> 03:42.763
Oh, there's no cell phone
reception on the island.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.097
We paid a lot of money for that.

03:44.225 --> 03:45.098
You can make your tiktoks

03:45.226 --> 03:46.350
When you get home, bob.

03:46.435 --> 03:47.476
-That's not what I--
-come, come.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.644
Bring the ring-a-ding!

03:48.729 --> 03:50.020
Yup, yup. Sure.

hammerschmidt.

03:55.778 --> 03:56.777
How were the hearings?

03:56.904 --> 03:59.029
Some people are going to prison.
Not me.

03:59.114 --> 04:02.366
-Brother calvin.
-Downtown randolph brackenbrown.

04:02.493 --> 04:03.700
-There he is.
-Here I am.

Soggie auggie sharfenheimer.
The gang's all here.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.705
Calvin, no chefs
at the sacred circle.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.832
They're supposed
to stay at the tents.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.334
Can I keep him?
The liquor pitcher's

04:12.461 --> 04:14.127
All sweaty;
I don't want to hold it.

04:14.213 --> 04:15.212
Let's have a taste.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.547
The cocktail will
decide his fate.

04:17.633 --> 04:19.675
Oh, uh, okay.

04:19.802 --> 04:21.843
Mmm. Exquisite. He can stay.

04:21.971 --> 04:23.512
Why does
your chef look so familiar?

04:23.639 --> 04:26.056
Was he working the omelet
station at your last sex party?

04:26.183 --> 04:28.183
-What?
-No. Bob's a burger man.

04:28.269 --> 04:29.643
Well, those were good omelets.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.354
And a hell of a sex party.
Just really well-organized.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.107
I went a bit more upscale
with my private chef.

04:35.234 --> 04:37.234
I brought sergio, from sergio.

04:37.361 --> 04:38.610
-Heard of it.
-Me, too.

04:38.696 --> 04:40.487
He's making llama
because I only eat llama now.

04:40.531 --> 04:43.573
-Oh, enough about the llama!
-More llama drama?

04:43.659 --> 04:45.200
Mr. I brought a live llama

04:45.327 --> 04:46.576
Can't seem to talk
about anything else.

04:46.662 --> 04:48.495
-You're gonna
slaughter it here?
-No.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.497
For every one that I eat,
I adopt a live one.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.582
-Some people don't get it.
-Yeah, I don't get it.

04:52.668 --> 04:54.584
-I'm one of those people.
-Sergio gets it.

04:54.712 --> 04:56.211
Well, what do you say,
fellas, shall we, uh,

04:56.255 --> 04:57.629
Tell the chefs to start cooking?

04:57.756 --> 05:00.716
We'll have our feast,
then let out our inner beast.

05:00.801 --> 05:04.177
[August] feast and beast.
I love that they rhyme.

05:05.556 --> 05:08.223
[thunder crashes]

05:08.309 --> 05:11.393
Not bad, burger-meister.
I saw randolph eyeing my dinner.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.145
-He barely touched his llama.
-Oh. Thanks.

05:13.230 --> 05:16.189
-What are you doing, cleaning?
Pfft-- square.
-Yup.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.275
I just took a bunch
of drugs, bob. A bunch.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.901
All mixed together
in a cast-iron cauldron

05:20.029 --> 05:21.611
That we heated over the fire.

05:21.697 --> 05:23.238
That's how people do drugs.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.782
That seems to make sense
for what this is.

05:25.909 --> 05:28.243
-Can you do my face paint?
-Uh, sure.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.787
-Wha-- what's this for?
-Tradition! Ritual!

05:30.914 --> 05:33.540
Make me look like simon lebon
in "hungry like the wolf."

05:33.667 --> 05:35.417
I'm just gonna-- do a stripe.

05:35.502 --> 05:38.628
Oh, you're moving.
So that-- that looks good.

05:38.797 --> 05:41.048
Feeling strong. Very strong.

05:41.133 --> 05:42.341
[wind whooshing]

05:42.468 --> 05:45.218
Whoa. Speaking of strong.
Geez, this is--

05:45.346 --> 05:47.721
It's-- I think
it's about to rain.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.973
-Uh, do you-- do you feel drops?
-It's starting, bob.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.475
It's starting.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.185
-So, this is a storm, I think.
-[dance music playing]

05:53.354 --> 05:54.728
The one you said
wasn't gonna happen?

05:54.813 --> 05:59.232
[fischoeder laughs]
I love electronic dance music!

05:59.401 --> 06:00.567
Great.

06:01.403 --> 06:02.694
Still nothing from your father.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.154
How's he even supposed
to grill burgers

06:04.239 --> 06:05.530
In a storm like this?

06:05.616 --> 06:06.656
When you don't listen
to scotty baggs,

06:06.742 --> 06:07.949
You end up with soggy buns.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.951
He's on a camping weekend
with rich people.

06:10.079 --> 06:11.536
I assume
there are butlers that hold

06:11.663 --> 06:12.996
Umbrellas over all the buns.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.082
Speaking of buns, why are
we not eating post-dinner,

06:15.209 --> 06:16.458
Pre-bedtime snacks right now?

06:16.585 --> 06:18.668
My hand keeps doing this,
but there's nothing in it.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.003
I'll go get something.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.630
I'll go with you
so it's not just crackers.

06:21.799 --> 06:22.756
-No offense.
-What?

06:22.841 --> 06:24.341
We had carrots that one time.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.176
Dad left a lot of bar things.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.844
-It's like we live in
a nightclub now.
-Yeah.

06:27.930 --> 06:30.055
Your dad was sir mix-a-lologist
last night.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.681
It was quite the cocktail party.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.725
If you like a cocktail party
where it's just you

06:33.811 --> 06:36.186
-And the person making drinks.
-Are those a real thing?

06:36.355 --> 06:38.480
I thought cocktail parties were
just in movies and tv shows.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.274
Oh, yeah, someone
invites you to their house,

06:41.360 --> 06:43.443
And they made snacks
and they made a playlist

06:43.570 --> 06:45.320
And you have to pretend
you like their music.

06:45.406 --> 06:46.655
You'll go to them
when you're a little older.

06:46.782 --> 06:48.198
It's how adults socialize.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.158
Until they have kids.
Then you don't do anything.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.952
I don't understand, why is
it called a cocktail party?

06:52.037 --> 06:52.994
Why isn't it called

06:53.122 --> 06:54.329
A "hanging out and talking"
party?

06:54.415 --> 06:55.455
Is that what you guys are doing?

06:55.541 --> 06:57.624
'cause the snacks are...
Taking a while.

06:57.793 --> 06:59.292
Snacks are coming,
they're coming.

06:59.378 --> 07:00.919
They call 'em cocktail parties

07:01.004 --> 07:02.838
Because some grown-ups
have a drink to loosen up.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.173
But don't have too many 'cause
then you don't get invited back.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.134
And don't
monopolize the conversation,

07:07.219 --> 07:08.969
Don't stay too late,
don't get there too early.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.637
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
should I be writing this down?

07:10.764 --> 07:12.139
-You're freaking me out.
-Don't wear brown and black.

07:12.224 --> 07:13.932
Never look into someone's eyes.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.600
Bring your own fork
and briefcase.

07:15.644 --> 07:16.935
-Of course.
Everyone knows that.
-Huh. Huh. Huh...

07:17.062 --> 07:18.687
And leave one
of your shoes as a gift.

07:18.814 --> 07:20.230
-But you got to hide it.
-Aah! I don't get it.

07:20.357 --> 07:21.815
How does everyone know
all this stuff?

07:21.900 --> 07:24.693
No, no, no, don't listen to
them, they're messing with you.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.403
But I can show you everything
you need to know.

07:26.521 --> 07:28.363
You want to have
a mocktail party?

07:28.407 --> 07:30.407
Kids, meet me in
the living room in ten minutes.

07:30.576 --> 07:31.533
Wear something nice.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.410
How much cleavage is
too much cleavage?

07:33.495 --> 07:34.703
-Your call.
-Ooh...

07:34.830 --> 07:36.204
This'll probably be
just as fancy

07:36.248 --> 07:38.081
As the party
your dad's at right now.

07:38.167 --> 07:39.958
[thunder crashes]

07:40.043 --> 07:42.085
Oh, my god, oh, my god.

07:42.921 --> 07:46.006
Huh? What?!

07:46.091 --> 07:48.425
[panting]

07:49.094 --> 07:50.302
[dance music playing]

07:50.429 --> 07:52.137
Mr. Fischoeder,
people are leaving.

07:52.264 --> 07:54.181
Boats are leaving.
They-- they took the llama,

07:54.308 --> 07:56.057
-And they left!
-Bob! Bob!

07:56.143 --> 07:57.684
You're saying too many words.

07:57.769 --> 08:00.061
Close this part,
shake that part.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.689
Look at hubert, he's all hips.
And drugs.

08:02.733 --> 08:04.232
Mr. Fischoeder, I'm worried

08:04.359 --> 08:05.609
That this storm
is gonna get worse,

08:05.736 --> 08:08.320
And we're on an island,
and our phones don't work.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.989
-And that's bad.
-No. That's good.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.491
That's why we're here.

08:12.576 --> 08:13.742
You just don't have
enough face paint on.

08:13.827 --> 08:14.910
It keeps you dry.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.912
Haven't you noticed
I'm completely dry?

08:16.997 --> 08:19.873
-Have you asked yourself
how that's possible?
-Uh-oh.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.626
[all howling]

08:24.004 --> 08:26.004
You are all very stoned.

08:26.089 --> 08:27.797
Okay, I'm gonna
go pack everything

08:27.925 --> 08:29.841
Onto your boat
and then we should go.

08:29.927 --> 08:32.052
And everyone else
should go soon, too.

08:32.137 --> 08:34.846
I will be right back
to get you and whoever

08:34.890 --> 08:37.265
Wants to live tonight, okay?

08:38.769 --> 08:41.436
Oh, boy, tent not looking good.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.980
[grunting]

08:44.107 --> 08:46.441
And the boats are sinking.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.151
Mr. Fischoeder?

08:48.946 --> 08:50.195
Hello?

08:51.073 --> 08:53.073
M-mr. Fischoeder?

08:54.701 --> 08:56.993
Is that blood? Oh, my god.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.537
-Bob.
-Huh?

08:58.664 --> 08:59.663
-Turn off your light.
-What?

08:59.831 --> 09:02.832
-Why?
-Shh. He's hunting us.

09:02.918 --> 09:04.793
He took a bite
out of randolph's arm.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.253
-Who took a bite?
-Hubert.

09:06.338 --> 09:07.963
He's gone completely wild.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.631
He's turned into
some sort of animal

09:09.716 --> 09:10.966
With eddie bauer pants on.

09:11.093 --> 09:13.260
Okay, well, I have to tell you
about your boat.

09:13.345 --> 09:15.637
[growling]

09:15.722 --> 09:17.597
-Oh...
-Shh.

09:18.559 --> 09:20.642
[snarling]

09:20.727 --> 09:22.686
[hubert shouting, growling]

09:22.813 --> 09:25.105
[bob muffled]
oh, my god!

09:29.361 --> 09:31.861
This is awful.
This is so, so awful.

09:31.989 --> 09:33.947
We're trapped
on this island with that?

09:34.074 --> 09:35.657
Why did I say yes to this?

09:35.784 --> 09:37.534
-Ugh, this is gonna get
infected.
-[fischoeder] shush.

09:37.661 --> 09:40.245
-Calvin, you don't have
any antibiotics, do you?
-No.

09:40.330 --> 09:43.540
Seems like kind of a nerdy thing
to pack on a boys' weekend.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.208
Ah, it hurts. Aah!

09:45.335 --> 09:46.710
What's the point of taking drugs

09:46.837 --> 09:48.837
If you feel pain when
someone bites your shoulder?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.130
Should we make
our way to the boats?

09:50.215 --> 09:51.631
This has been fun,
but, bob, I think

09:51.758 --> 09:53.133
You were saying
something about packing up?

09:53.218 --> 09:54.884
There's no boats,
mr. Fischoeder.

09:55.012 --> 09:56.678
That's what I was trying
to tell you.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.263
They're all gone
or they're smashed.

09:58.390 --> 09:59.848
-What? Why didn't you tell me?
-I did!

09:59.933 --> 10:02.517
-You were on drugs.
-Don't blame the drugs!

10:02.561 --> 10:05.437
-What boats are gone? Who left?
-A lot of people.

10:05.564 --> 10:08.189
The private chefs are all gone,
I think. Other people.

10:08.317 --> 10:10.692
They saw the storm and they left
'cause they're smart.

10:10.819 --> 10:12.527
-Who's this guy?
-He's sober.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.529
-Oh...
-Shush.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.364
-[bushes rustling]
-[roars]

10:16.450 --> 10:18.491
-Aah!
-Run!

10:19.328 --> 10:20.535
You're not an animal, hubert!

10:20.662 --> 10:21.745
You're an episcopalian.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.538
[growling]

10:26.918 --> 10:28.043
[hubert howling]

10:28.795 --> 10:31.630
You know what we need?
A couple more ring-a-dings.

10:31.757 --> 10:33.548
[linda]
<i> looking nice.</i>

10:33.634 --> 10:35.550
Looking very sophisticated.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.886
Gene, liking the shorts
with dad's jacket.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.763
Mm-hmm. Business dad-ual.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.806
And I invented
a new way to tie a tie.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.475
It makes the old way
look stupid.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.810
All right, now that we have
some drinks in hand,

10:45.896 --> 10:47.771
Let's do some role-play.
Tina, stand there.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.147
-You're the host.
-I'm the host?

10:49.232 --> 10:50.440
Just for this, just for this.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.776
Okay, I'm the first guest
to arrive. You ready?

10:52.861 --> 10:54.986
-Ding-dong.
-Hello.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.447
Hi, honey. Mwah.
I'm 30 minutes early. Mwah.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.032
Here's a bottle of wine that
someone gave me as a gift.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.492
Is that what you're gonna
wear tonight?

11:00.577 --> 11:02.118
-Um...
-Aren't you gonna put on music?

11:02.162 --> 11:03.828
-Oh...
-Can I help out
with snacks or anything?

11:03.955 --> 11:05.455
-What?
-No? Okay, can I see
what you have

11:05.582 --> 11:06.915
-In the fridge?
I haven't had dinner.
-Wait...

11:07.000 --> 11:08.291
Also, I blocked
your neighbor's driveway.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.251
-He's cool, right? And scene.
-Oh, uh...

11:10.379 --> 11:11.836
Do's and don'ts. Call 'em out.

11:11.922 --> 11:13.421
What did I do right,
what did I do wrong?

11:13.590 --> 11:14.547
Um, you showed up early.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.174
-That's nice.
-No, no, no.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.051
Showing up 30 minutes early
is worse

11:18.220 --> 11:19.678
Than showing up an hour late.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.721
-Aah!
-Just take the time
they tell you to arrive,

11:21.765 --> 11:23.556
Add 30 minutes, and you're good.

11:23.684 --> 11:24.599
What else? Call 'em out!

11:24.685 --> 11:25.809
Don't be like how you were.

11:25.936 --> 11:27.560
More specifically.
What did I do wrong?

11:27.646 --> 11:28.728
Everything after hello?

11:28.814 --> 11:29.938
Correct.
Let's do another one,

11:30.065 --> 11:31.231
Let's do another one.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.607
Louise, stand here.
We're both guests.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.025
You're waiting for the bathroom.

11:34.111 --> 11:35.276
I come up behind you.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.361
Hi, I'm drunk.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.780
Will you hold up
my hair while I puke?

11:38.865 --> 11:40.782
-And scene.
-She seems fun.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.326
Okay, let's stop for a minute.

11:43.412 --> 11:45.328
I can't see where we're going.

11:45.414 --> 11:46.788
But I don't want
to use the lamp

11:46.873 --> 11:48.456
Because the bitey guy
might see us.

11:48.542 --> 11:51.209
-The "bitey guy" has
a name, bob.
-Ugh.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.669
God, I wish we had our guns.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.421
Not to kill him, just
to shoot him a little bit.

11:54.506 --> 11:56.172
Yeah,
why don't you have your guns?

11:56.341 --> 11:57.841
Uh, I thought
that was part of your

11:57.926 --> 11:59.718
-Group dynamic.
-No guns on the island.

11:59.803 --> 12:03.138
Our insurance covers us
for drugs or guns. But not both.

12:03.265 --> 12:04.806
Can we stay here? Are we hidden?

12:04.891 --> 12:06.391
-Uh, I think we're hidden.
-Found you.

12:06.518 --> 12:07.809
-Ah!
-Yeah, we could hear

12:07.894 --> 12:09.310
Your voices all
the way from over there.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.229
You two get bit at all?
Still just me?

12:11.356 --> 12:13.565
-Stop asking that!
-Mosquitos love me, too.
-[twig snaps]

12:13.650 --> 12:15.525
-What was that?
Did you fart, bob?
-No.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.361
That was a twig snapping.
Farts don't sound like that.

12:18.447 --> 12:19.654
Some do.

12:19.781 --> 12:22.073
-[hubert roaring]
-[all cry out]

12:22.200 --> 12:23.616
-That hurts!
-Told you.

12:23.744 --> 12:27.370
-Stop biting us, hubert!
-And put some clothes on.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.539
[hubert howling]

12:29.666 --> 12:32.250
All right. Uh, I think
we have to go on offense.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.169
If we keep running,
he's just gonna keep

12:34.337 --> 12:35.754
Jumping out of the bushes
and biting us.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.589
-"us"? Have you been bitten?
-Oh, hush.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.799
You were pretty pissy
about some of us talking

12:39.885 --> 12:41.509
About our bites
just, like, a moment ago.

12:41.595 --> 12:44.304
-Listen to bob. I'm nominating
him for captain.
-What?

12:44.389 --> 12:46.139
He's the least drugged-up
of all of us.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.348
-Who's bob?
-Me.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.142
But I don't want to be captain.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.143
I just want to live.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.561
Listen, this hubert guy.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.521
Ca-can we catch him somehow?
Trap him?

12:53.607 --> 12:55.440
If we can tie him up
till the drugs wear off

12:55.567 --> 12:57.150
Then all we'll have
to deal with is the storm.

12:57.235 --> 13:00.195
That gives a slightly better
chance of surviving the night.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.572
Trapping hubert. Hmm... Not bad.

13:02.657 --> 13:05.784
-True. Good idea, captain.
-To set a trap we need bait.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.368
[all except bob]
not it!

13:07.454 --> 13:08.203
Wait, what?

13:08.288 --> 13:09.537
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

13:09.664 --> 13:10.830
Bad plan, bad plan!

13:10.957 --> 13:12.582
Just a little more beef
on the eyebrows

13:12.667 --> 13:14.626
To make him seem extra tasty,
and I think we're done.

13:14.753 --> 13:18.213
[August]
I'm giving him a beef mustache
on top of his real mustache.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.799
Clever! And the trap is baited.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.676
No, your captain says no.
No human bait, no human bait.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.595
Sorry, bob, the captain
doesn't have voting rights.

13:25.680 --> 13:29.224
-I'll never forget you, captain.
-Oh, my god.

13:33.355 --> 13:35.230
Guys, please untie me.
I don't like this.

13:35.357 --> 13:36.439
[fischoeder]
don't worry, bob.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.107
We're not gonna
let hubert eat you.

13:38.193 --> 13:39.859
I mean, not all of you.
Just nibble long enough

13:39.986 --> 13:41.945
So that we can grab him
and tie him up.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.196
Ten to 15 bites max.

13:43.281 --> 13:44.614
It's just, the "not it" thing.

13:44.741 --> 13:45.824
I wasn't ready.

13:45.951 --> 13:47.784
Should we count one, two, three?
Do-over?

13:47.911 --> 13:49.702
-[all except bob] one, two,
three, not it!
-Damn it.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.287
[linda]
<i> okay, let's review.</i>

13:51.373 --> 13:52.997
How many drinks do you have
at a cocktail party?

13:53.083 --> 13:55.041
-Depends on your body weight?
-And zodiac sign.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.669
-Your age plus one.
-No, no, no, two and a half.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.921
First one loosens you up.
Second one, nurse it.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.674
Last one, put it down, don't
finish it, you don't need it.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.133
But don't put in on the stereo

14:04.261 --> 14:05.802
Or any furniture where
it's gonna leave a little ring.

14:05.929 --> 14:07.595
Make a big show
of looking for a coaster.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.222
-What's a coaster?
-We don't have any.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.724
But some people do. Some people
care about their furniture.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.643
But where-- where do I put this?

14:13.770 --> 14:14.978
I'm pouring mine in the plant.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.312
No, no, plants don't like
sweet drinks.

14:16.439 --> 14:17.647
-Just hard liquor?
-Tina, hold onto it.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.107
Pretend it's your second.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.441
Okay, let me think, what's next?

14:20.569 --> 14:22.777
Ooh, I'm gonna throw
my keys into the key bowl.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.279
I think it's
something grown-ups do when

14:24.364 --> 14:25.530
They want to meet
sigourney weaver.

14:25.699 --> 14:26.698
I'm loosening my tie.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.867
Dad's missing a wild night.

14:28.994 --> 14:30.034
[straining]

14:30.161 --> 14:32.036
How did you tie this so well?

14:32.122 --> 14:33.079
You're all so stoned.

14:33.164 --> 14:35.456
I had a friendship bracelet
period.

14:35.584 --> 14:36.833
Calvin doesn't wear his.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.751
It just doesn't really go
with anything I own.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.420
-[hubert howling]
-[shushing] quiet.

14:40.505 --> 14:41.880
-Quiet.
-He sounds hungrier.

14:41.965 --> 14:44.465
Guys, guys,
le-let's do this differently.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.175
May-maybe we dig a hole?
Put a tarp across?

14:46.261 --> 14:48.469
-Oh, but who wants
to dig a hole?
-[bob groans]

14:48.513 --> 14:49.679
I should never have come here.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.764
I just needed a new condenser.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.433
Hmm...

14:53.518 --> 14:56.269
I'm gonna go, uh,
put some more meat on him.

14:56.313 --> 14:57.687
I think we missed a few spots.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.981
Give him a beard.
To go with the mustache.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.609
-Here I am, putting meat on you.
-What are you doing?

15:02.736 --> 15:05.111
-I'm taking your wallet
in case he kills you.
-What?

15:05.196 --> 15:07.030
Kidding. I'm untying you.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.407
And some meat there,
and some more meat here.

15:09.534 --> 15:10.950
Thank you. But why?

15:11.077 --> 15:13.536
I don't know.
Guess my buzz is wearing off.

15:13.622 --> 15:15.038
And someone needs to cook
breakfast in the morning.

15:15.165 --> 15:17.165
[hubert roars, howls]

15:17.292 --> 15:18.833
Now hubert sounds horny?

15:18.960 --> 15:22.503
-Go, go, run.
-Ah! You didn't untie my feet.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.297
-I thought it would be funny.
-Aah!

15:24.382 --> 15:26.591
The bait's getting away!
The bait's getting away!

15:26.676 --> 15:28.134
-Calvin?
-Sorry, fellas!

15:28.261 --> 15:30.178
He's my chef. Food before dudes.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.472
-Let's get 'em!
We'll use both as bait!
-Yes!

15:32.599 --> 15:35.642
You hear that, calvin?
You just joined d'bait club.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.477
[August]
oh, that's good.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.104
Oh. Oh, boy.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.356
They seemed really ticked off.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.691
I hope they don't
vote me out of the club.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.944
The kicking-out ceremony
is brutal.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.278
-So much singing.
-Sorry.

15:47.364 --> 15:49.989
But also, this club
doesn't seem great, so...

15:50.075 --> 15:52.951
I can see how the biting thing
has been a bit of a downer.

15:53.078 --> 15:56.079
No, all of it. Your people.
And the way you are.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.748
-And the things you do.
-Quietly run the world?

15:58.833 --> 16:01.334
Really well, with no problems?
We actually have an award party.

16:01.419 --> 16:04.337
We all get trophies. We're gonna
need a chef for that, too, bob.

16:04.422 --> 16:05.672
Oh, don't worry,
it's a different island.

16:05.832 --> 16:06.923
Oh, my goodness, the boathouse!

16:07.092 --> 16:08.383
-What boathouse?
-The one on the other side

16:08.468 --> 16:10.218
Of the island
that has a boat in it.

16:10.345 --> 16:11.636
-You're just
remembering this now?
-Yes.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.346
Well, it's old. No one uses it.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.640
And, uh-- and there
may be just a dinghy there,

16:15.725 --> 16:17.225
But still, worth a shot?
Row home?

16:17.352 --> 16:19.602
-Get to my house tonight
in time for a nightcap?
-[stammers]

16:19.688 --> 16:22.522
I don't think we should go out
in the open ocean in a dinghy.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.983
-In... A bad storm.
-Aw, the weather's calming down.

16:25.068 --> 16:27.402
And it's not exactly
the open ocean.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.988
Yeah, it is. We're, like,
an hour away from the mainland.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.072
More like five minutes.

16:31.199 --> 16:32.573
Maybe 15 in the dinghy.

16:32.701 --> 16:33.908
Depends on who's rowing. Not it.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.411
What? Then why did it
take us so long?

16:36.496 --> 16:38.037
You've never had
a secret island, have you?

16:38.206 --> 16:39.122
You can't blindfold someone and

16:39.249 --> 16:40.373
Then go five minutes away.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.500
-I did a few laps.
-Oh, my god.

16:42.544 --> 16:44.002
Well, do you--
do you think we could

16:44.129 --> 16:45.294
Fit everybody on the dinghy?

16:45.380 --> 16:47.630
Yeah.
Anyway, I think I know the way.

16:47.716 --> 16:49.048
Should we talk and walk,
but quietly?

16:49.134 --> 16:51.426
Because of the multiple
parties hunting us?

16:51.469 --> 16:52.802
Oh, and while
we're walking, maybe, uh,

16:52.887 --> 16:55.179
You can think of a reasonable
partial refund for me

16:55.306 --> 16:57.640
-Since it looks like
you won't be cooking breakfast.
-Ugh.

16:57.726 --> 16:59.308
[hubert howling nearby]

16:59.394 --> 17:00.935
God, I hate that he does that.

17:01.062 --> 17:03.771
No boathouse there.
No boathouse there.

17:03.898 --> 17:05.606
I also hate when you do that.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.026
It makes me think that you don't
know where we're going.

17:08.111 --> 17:09.861
Am I thinking of the right
boathouse? Darn.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.195
And now it's starting
to seem like

17:11.322 --> 17:12.739
-Something I made up.
-What?!

17:12.824 --> 17:15.033
-Well, we had
a nice walk, anyway.
-[bob groaning]

17:15.118 --> 17:16.784
-Oh, there it is!
-Oh.

17:16.828 --> 17:18.369
I'm pretty sure
this is the boathouse

17:18.496 --> 17:20.663
With the dinghy inside.
Wait, was it a dinghy?

17:20.749 --> 17:23.407
Or was it a disco?
Now, that was a cool boathouse.

17:23.501 --> 17:24.584
-Hey!
-What the...

17:24.669 --> 17:27.211
-Quit it!
-Ow!
-Geez, samuel, too far.

17:27.297 --> 17:28.588
Oh, I thought we were doing

17:28.673 --> 17:30.256
The whole
whacky-whacky-stick-thing.

17:30.341 --> 17:32.633
Nope? Okay, well, "sorry."

17:32.719 --> 17:33.926
[fischoeder]
no need. I didn't even feel it.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.428
[bob]
you didn't get hit, I did.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.846
[fischoeder]
oh, well,

17:36.973 --> 17:38.222
-Then apology accepted.
-[bob] oh, my god.

17:42.353 --> 17:43.686
Guys, I really don't like
being tied up.

17:43.813 --> 17:44.896
I tried to express that earlier

17:44.981 --> 17:46.189
When you tied me up
the first time.

17:46.316 --> 17:47.857
Tied up twice in the same day.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.275
Is that a record for you?
Not for me.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.943
And you people are
not listening to me.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.737
There's a boat in the boathouse.
We can use it

17:52.864 --> 17:54.197
To get off the island.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.157
The bait's trying
to trick us again.

17:56.242 --> 17:57.283
Sorry, bait.

17:57.368 --> 17:59.327
Might. There might be
a boat in there.

17:59.454 --> 18:00.453
Stop saying that!

18:00.538 --> 18:02.121
Can someone
just go and look inside?

18:02.248 --> 18:03.873
-All the way over there?
-I'll go.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.583
It's the least bitten thing
I can do.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.627
I can't believe
you were gonna leave us, calvin.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.254
And to think, I was going
to let you taste my llama.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.006
We weren't. We were
gonna get everybody.

18:12.133 --> 18:15.134
-Yeah, everybody... Ish.
-It's here! I call front!

18:15.261 --> 18:17.637
-Wonderful. I call
not-next-to-auggie.
-Hey.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.431
Sorry. It's just,
you know how you are in boats.

18:20.558 --> 18:22.642
Okay, come on,
calvin and calvin's chef.

18:22.727 --> 18:25.478
-You can hop to the boathouse,
right?
-Bye-bye, babylon island.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.522
See you next year!
And good luck to you, hubert,

18:27.649 --> 18:28.606
Wherever you are.

18:28.733 --> 18:29.649
You'll be getting a bill

18:29.734 --> 18:30.942
From my dermatologist!

18:31.069 --> 18:33.778
No, no, guys.
Y-you can't leave your friend.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.154
-Mmm, "friend"?
-I don't know why we're

18:35.281 --> 18:37.115
-Calling him a friend.
-Professional acquaintance.

18:37.242 --> 18:38.533
I am married to his sister.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.576
But can we get going?
Discuss it on the boat?

18:40.703 --> 18:41.953
You-- you can't leave hubert.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.204
He could get hurt.

18:43.331 --> 18:45.373
Or possibly die.
You would all feel bad.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.667
I won't feel that bad.
Because I will be in my bed.

18:47.752 --> 18:49.794
You got to make some
tough decisions sometimes.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.754
You got to be strong,
burger guy.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.214
That's what this island's
all about.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.382
-Mm-hmm.
-Sure.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.425
You guys think
a little compassion is weak?

18:56.469 --> 18:57.885
A little decency?

18:58.012 --> 19:00.138
I-it might not be easy,
but it's definitely strong.

19:00.223 --> 19:01.764
That-that's what I think.

19:01.850 --> 19:03.391
Should we just start backing
towards the boathouse?

19:03.518 --> 19:06.435
-Nod and step, nod and step.
-[groaning]

19:06.563 --> 19:10.022
I think the self-righteous,
high-horsed burger man is right.

19:10.108 --> 19:11.607
It would be wrong,
and not strong,

19:11.734 --> 19:13.192
For us to leave hubert behind.

19:13.352 --> 19:14.318
-Hey.
-Whoa.
-Oh.

19:14.404 --> 19:17.071
And I have an idea that I hate,

19:17.157 --> 19:19.198
But you will all like.

19:19.284 --> 19:21.033
[samuel]
he's right. I really do like it.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.035
-He's just good bait.
-I know.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.370
I kind of want to eat him.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.582

-Thank you.

[hubert snarling]

19:30.044 --> 19:31.752
Oh, here he comes.
And now he's nude.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.462
He's in good shape, isn't he?

19:33.548 --> 19:35.673
Everyone ready?
Everyone ready with the tarp?

19:35.758 --> 19:36.966
You guys don't look ready.

19:37.093 --> 19:39.302
-Where is the tarp?
-Oh, right, the tarp.

19:39.387 --> 19:41.304
-Where did we put that?
-Oh, my god.

19:41.431 --> 19:43.306
-Huh. Huh. Huh. Huh.
-What are you doing in here?

19:43.433 --> 19:45.558
We're practicing how to get
out of a boring conversation.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.977
Which is actually really fun.
You should come back.

19:48.062 --> 19:49.562
I can't, mom, I can't.

19:49.647 --> 19:51.272
I don't know how I'm gonna
remember all this stuff.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.815
I'm never gonna be able
to be an adult.

19:52.901 --> 19:54.442
A-and no one
is ever gonna want me

19:54.611 --> 19:55.651
At their cocktail party.

19:55.737 --> 19:56.903
How am I gonna remember to come

19:57.030 --> 19:58.946
A half-hour late, use a coaster,
don't double-dip,

19:59.073 --> 20:00.406
Ask people questions
about themselves,

20:00.491 --> 20:01.490
Two and a half drink max,

20:01.618 --> 20:03.534
Make sure the bathroom door
is locked

20:03.620 --> 20:05.369
Before you pee, thank the host
and don't be the last one out?

20:05.455 --> 20:07.496
It's too much.
I can't remember it all!

20:07.582 --> 20:09.790
Tina, that was everything
from top to bottom.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.292
-You did it.
-I did?

20:11.377 --> 20:12.960
Did the party move in here?

20:13.046 --> 20:15.087
-Yeah, this is where
the cool kids are.
-Where are they hiding?

20:15.215 --> 20:17.089
Now teach us how
to make nice with the cops

20:17.175 --> 20:18.299
When they come about the noise.

20:18.384 --> 20:19.926
Ooh, yeah, let's do that one.

20:20.011 --> 20:22.178
I'll be the cops.

Hello, officer, does this dance

20:24.224 --> 20:25.848
Make you want to join the party?

20:35.068 --> 20:37.610

20:37.737 --> 20:40.404
-Yup.
-Just send me the doctor's
bill like the rest of them.

20:40.531 --> 20:42.573
Does anyone else want
to go get ice cream?

20:42.700 --> 20:43.741
-Yes.
-Ooh, ice cream.

-Love this guy

20:45.286 --> 20:47.328
-Anyone have any extra pants?
-I'd like to go home.

No. You know where
the secret island is now.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.458
-What?!
-[fischoeder] kidding.

20:52.502 --> 20:53.292
But you do have
to come for ice cream.

20:53.378 --> 20:54.961
It won't be any fun without you.

20:55.088 --> 20:56.629
