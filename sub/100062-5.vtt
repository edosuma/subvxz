WEBVTT

00:02.263 --> 00:04.178
You got tension on me, Evan?
I gotta go deeper.

00:04.221 --> 00:06.658
Deeper?!
Huang, you're a madman!

00:06.702 --> 00:08.095
I don't have a choice.

00:08.138 --> 00:10.662
Your mom insists on putting
all the Halloween decorations

00:10.706 --> 00:11.837
in the back.

00:11.881 --> 00:13.317
Because she hates
the holiday.

00:13.361 --> 00:14.753
Yeah,
that ends this year.

00:14.797 --> 00:15.928
Aah!
Aah!

00:15.972 --> 00:17.060
I dropped the rope,
you're on your own!

00:17.104 --> 00:18.061
No, no, no, it's okay.

00:18.105 --> 00:19.889
It's just
your mom's novel --

00:19.932 --> 00:21.891
"A Case
of a Knife to the Brain."

00:21.934 --> 00:22.718
Scary.

00:22.761 --> 00:23.936
Oh.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.938
You mean the part where
the butler lost all his skin?

00:25.982 --> 00:28.898
No, I mean how many
unsold copies we still have.

00:29.986 --> 00:31.205
Pushing on.

00:36.297 --> 00:38.299
Sandy.

00:38.342 --> 00:40.344
The queen bee
of my haunted house.

00:40.388 --> 00:43.173
Which I realize is confusing
because she's a spider.

00:43.217 --> 00:45.523
Haunted house? That's
your plan to get Mom
on board with Halloween?

00:45.567 --> 00:47.917
I know it's a long shot,
but I got a plan

00:47.960 --> 00:49.440
to make it all about her.

00:49.484 --> 00:51.355
Huh.
She'd like that.

00:51.399 --> 00:54.315
What's the only thing she lovesmore than sensible footwear?

00:54.358 --> 00:55.751
Instilling fear in people.

00:55.794 --> 00:58.188
Which she can do
in her very own haunted house.

00:58.232 --> 00:59.233
Ah.

00:59.276 --> 01:00.799
No.
No crazy house.

01:00.843 --> 01:02.105
It's a hauntedhouse.

01:02.149 --> 01:05.195
Call it whatever you want,
we're not having one here.

01:07.937 --> 01:09.286
You told me to pull
if you were in trouble.

01:09.330 --> 01:11.201
So I'm pulling.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.292
--Captions by VITAC--

Well, think about

01:30.307 --> 01:32.004
I mean, isn't this scary?

01:33.223 --> 01:34.964
What am I looking at?

01:35.007 --> 01:36.183
It's Sandy the spider.

01:36.226 --> 01:38.750
It fused with my Cher wigin the attic heat.

01:38.794 --> 01:40.535
Even Halloween accidents
are beautiful.

01:40.578 --> 01:42.580
Stop using words
that describe me

01:42.624 --> 01:45.279
to get me on board
with your stupid holiday.

01:45.322 --> 01:46.932
Well, I thought you'd love
a haunted house.

01:46.976 --> 01:48.151
Your heart
is fueled by fear.

01:48.195 --> 01:49.370
C'mon, pop out,

01:49.413 --> 01:51.285
scare the pants
off the neighborhood kids.

01:51.328 --> 01:53.635
No to strange kids walking
through our house all night

01:53.678 --> 01:55.419
with their dirty feet.

01:55.463 --> 01:57.378
It's bad enough your mother
doesn't brush her tires.

01:57.421 --> 01:58.727
I don't get it, Jessica.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.598
Your book
was a horror novel.

02:00.642 --> 02:02.165
It scared tens of --

02:02.209 --> 02:04.167
hundreds of people.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.647
Well, Louis,
it's just not for me.

02:05.690 --> 02:09.172
But, to prove that I am not
a total Scrooge --

02:09.216 --> 02:10.869
a real villain
on a real holiday --

02:10.913 --> 02:12.306
I bought you the treats

02:12.349 --> 02:14.221
to hand out
to the costumed beggars!

02:14.264 --> 02:15.396
I knew it!

02:15.439 --> 02:17.180
Somewhere beneath
that hard candy shell

02:17.224 --> 02:18.877
lies a soft, gooey --

02:20.227 --> 02:21.445
Raisins?!

02:21.489 --> 02:22.403
Raisins aren't candy!

02:22.446 --> 02:25.536
It says right on the box --
"nature's candy."

02:25.580 --> 02:27.321
But, Jessica,
the neighborhood knows

02:27.364 --> 02:29.192
I'm a double-barrel
candy man --

02:29.236 --> 02:31.673
Twix, Reese's, Kit Kat.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.849
That's a double double-barrel!
A quad-barrel!

02:33.892 --> 02:35.416
Why is it
when it comes to Halloween,

02:35.459 --> 02:36.330
you never listen to me?

02:36.373 --> 02:37.983
That's not true.

02:38.027 --> 02:39.202
I listen to you.

02:39.246 --> 02:41.030
So are we
on the same page?

02:41.073 --> 02:42.423
Yes.

02:42.466 --> 02:43.641
No spooky house.

02:43.685 --> 02:45.426
Oh, come on!

02:45.469 --> 02:47.341
Hey, our house
will be haunted soon enough

02:47.384 --> 02:48.298
when your mother --

02:49.430 --> 02:51.475
Well, soon enough.

02:56.480 --> 02:59.222
These are like
scrapbook crack.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.484
We've had
some good times.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.051
Yeah, but looking back,

03:02.094 --> 03:04.619
it seems like we've exhausted
all the couples costumes.

03:04.662 --> 03:07.056
Maybe this is the year we can
finally do Frasier and Niles.

03:07.099 --> 03:09.711
I don't want to get
in a big fight over
who gets to be Niles.

03:09.754 --> 03:11.582
The last timeMaris and I got in a fight,

03:11.626 --> 03:14.455
we were roundly shushed bya particularly plucky sommelier.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.631
Talk about whining!

03:18.328 --> 03:20.678
Hey, Eddie,
big Halloween plans?

03:20.722 --> 03:23.246
Eh, I'm too old to 'ween it up.I'm just gonna skip it.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.682
But you boys have fun.

03:24.726 --> 03:26.293
No drugs, okay?

03:26.336 --> 03:27.859
"Too old to 'ween it up"?

03:27.903 --> 03:29.034
You hear that bull?

03:29.078 --> 03:30.906
Yeah.
He's growing up too fast.

03:30.949 --> 03:33.256
He's gonna miss this
when he's gone off to college.

03:35.737 --> 03:37.260
He did make
a great Dusty Bottoms.

03:37.304 --> 03:39.697
And soon, the Three Amigos
will be two.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.395
The Dos Amigos.

03:41.438 --> 03:42.265
Que lastima.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.440
That's it!

03:43.484 --> 03:45.399
That's the answer
to our costume problem.

03:45.442 --> 03:46.835
We bring back the trio.

03:46.878 --> 03:49.054
Three opens up
a world of possibilities.

03:49.098 --> 03:50.360
The 3 Chipmunks.

03:50.404 --> 03:51.448
The 3 Rice Krispie guys.

03:51.492 --> 03:52.493
The 3 states of matter.

03:52.536 --> 03:53.842
Solid, liquid --

03:53.885 --> 03:55.278
Eddie would be gas.Eddie would be gas.

03:55.322 --> 03:56.540
We'll keep thinking.

03:56.584 --> 03:58.194
Until then,we've got to get Eddie on board.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.848
Well, dear brother,

03:59.891 --> 04:01.545
it seems we've bested
another conundrum.

04:01.589 --> 04:03.460
Was that Frasier or Niles?

04:03.504 --> 04:05.549
Frasier.
But from "Cheers."

04:05.593 --> 04:06.768
Before he sold out.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.552
Hmm.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.731
What is our son's friend
doing in our bedroom, Louis?

04:13.775 --> 04:15.385
Afternoon, Mrs. H.

04:15.429 --> 04:16.952
Love the color scheme
in your bedroom --

04:16.995 --> 04:18.562
purple,
the color of royalty.

04:18.606 --> 04:20.564
Don't sit there.

04:20.608 --> 04:21.783
Or anywhere.

04:21.826 --> 04:23.350
Trent's helping me
pick out decorations.

04:23.393 --> 04:24.916
I said no haunted house.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.354
Now who's not listening
about Halloween?

04:27.397 --> 04:28.572
We're not doing it here.

04:28.616 --> 04:30.313
We're doing it at
the restaurant. Cattleman's.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.228
We're calling it
Cattleman's Haunted House.Cattleman's Haunted House.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.490
It's going to be huge.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.971
We need to work triple-timeto get the restaurant decorated,

04:36.014 --> 04:38.016
so I'm gonna need you
to take my place as a judge

04:38.060 --> 04:39.714
at the middle-school
costume competition.

04:39.757 --> 04:42.456
Did that ginger bite you
and infect your brain?

04:42.499 --> 04:43.761
Oh, come on,
you love judging.

04:43.805 --> 04:45.807
I love ajudge.
Judy.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.156
'Cause she's just like me --

04:47.199 --> 04:49.419
petite, brash,
can hold her pee for days.

04:49.463 --> 04:50.464
Judy.

04:50.507 --> 04:52.335
Hey, this wouldn't even be
an issue

04:52.379 --> 04:53.771
if you let me
have my thing here.

04:55.164 --> 04:57.209
I guess an hour of telling kidstheir outfits stink

04:57.253 --> 05:00.125
is better than a full night of
that nonsense in our own home.

05:00.169 --> 05:02.911
Okay, I'll judge
the dumb competition.

05:06.044 --> 05:08.177
You guys gotta knock.
I got a lady now.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.831
We had to knock more
when you didn'thave a lady.

05:09.874 --> 05:12.703
Eddie, do you have
any extra pillowcases

05:12.747 --> 05:14.009
just lying around?

05:14.052 --> 05:15.793
Nah, I stopped using them.
Too much work.

05:15.837 --> 05:17.795
Uch, you're a beast.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.623
We're gonna double bag
this Halloween.

05:19.667 --> 05:22.191
The weight from the candy tore
through our sacks last year.

05:22.234 --> 05:23.323
Continue.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.195
You've been out of the game
for too long.

05:26.238 --> 05:28.589
People hand out
full-size candy now.

05:28.632 --> 05:30.068
You love candy.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.548
I do.

05:32.854 --> 05:35.073
Eh, I'll just eat the leftoversDad doesn't hand out.

05:35.117 --> 05:37.162
Y'know,
trick-or-treat my own pad.

05:37.206 --> 05:39.861
Yeah, about that. Mommyactually
got the candy this year.

05:39.904 --> 05:41.645
She got...raisins.

05:41.689 --> 05:42.951
Chocolate-covered raisins?Nope.

05:42.994 --> 05:44.387
Yogurt-covered raisins?Unh-unh.

05:44.431 --> 05:45.997
White chocolate-covered
raisins?

05:46.041 --> 05:47.172
Worse.

05:47.216 --> 05:48.609
Goldenraisins.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.872
Mom got booger raisins?

05:50.915 --> 05:52.395
Still want to stay home
and chill?

05:52.439 --> 05:53.527
No, I'm in.

05:53.570 --> 05:56.399
But a pillowcase won't do.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.401
I'm gonna air out
Grandma's sleeping bag.

06:00.795 --> 06:03.101
Principal Hunter:
I love a couples costume.

06:03.145 --> 06:05.495
Double the effort,
double the score.

06:05.539 --> 06:07.323
98.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.543
What mighty big scores
you have!

06:09.586 --> 06:10.674
95!

06:10.718 --> 06:12.676
Can I give out
a negative number?

06:12.720 --> 06:14.635
A wolf should not have
a human girlfriend.

06:14.678 --> 06:17.246
It brings up
too many icky questions.

06:17.289 --> 06:18.813
2 points.
1 for each of you. Next.

06:21.511 --> 06:23.513
Thank you for not
using profanity this time,

06:23.557 --> 06:25.515
but can you maybe ease up
on the criticism?

06:25.559 --> 06:27.691
You made SpongeBob
cry through his makeup.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.260
Well, if he were
a believable sponge,

06:31.303 --> 06:32.870
he'd be able
to sop up his tears.

06:36.178 --> 06:38.267
All right, I'm in a pickle here,because I want to ask

06:38.310 --> 06:40.443
if there's more of the costume
under the trench coat,

06:40.487 --> 06:42.706
but if I say that,
I'll be in trouble.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.795
You're a mix of all the people
I see on the bus.

06:44.839 --> 06:47.711
I'm a detective frommy favorite murder-mystery book.

06:47.755 --> 06:50.061
100 out of 100!

06:50.932 --> 06:52.281
You know who she is?

06:52.324 --> 06:53.500
She's Jennifer Hong

06:53.543 --> 06:55.458
from "A Case
of a Knife to the Brain"!

06:55.502 --> 06:56.459
I am!

06:56.503 --> 06:58.287
Are you a fan of the book?

06:58.330 --> 06:59.723
Yes!

06:59.767 --> 07:01.246
Always nice to meet
another Brain-head.

07:01.290 --> 07:03.510
W-- I thought
I was the only one!

07:03.553 --> 07:06.817
Oh...there's more of us
out there.

07:11.735 --> 07:12.954
Yah! Aah!

07:12.997 --> 07:14.303
Louis,
I'm in for Halloween!

07:15.783 --> 07:17.524
Why does it suddenly
smell like your mother?

07:20.701 --> 07:22.746
Ohh! Nothing works!

07:26.663 --> 07:29.361
In for Halloween?
What does that mean?

07:29.405 --> 07:30.537
Oh, wait,
you're tricking me.

07:30.580 --> 07:32.843
No tricks.
All treats.

07:32.887 --> 07:35.498
A little girl
dressed up in the competition

07:35.542 --> 07:36.543
as Jennifer Hong!

07:36.586 --> 07:37.761
From your book?

07:37.805 --> 07:39.589
Come on.
What are the chances?

07:39.633 --> 07:41.504
Are you implying
that nobody read it?

07:42.810 --> 07:43.593
No.

07:43.637 --> 07:44.899
What I mean is,

07:44.942 --> 07:46.553
I find it hard to believe
a little girl would dress up

07:46.596 --> 07:48.337
as a character
from such a...

07:49.338 --> 07:50.644
...gritty novel.
Lotta sex in there.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.646
They made me
cut half of it out.

07:52.689 --> 07:53.864
They say they want real,
and then

07:53.908 --> 07:55.736
when you give it to them,
they don't want it.

07:55.779 --> 07:56.693
I don't know, Jessica.

07:56.737 --> 07:58.521
Maybe the girl was dressed
as something else.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.001
Inspector Gadget,
a flasher.

08:00.044 --> 08:02.133
No,
I will prove it to you.

08:02.177 --> 08:04.788
The girl gave me the address
to a Halloween party tonight.

08:04.832 --> 08:07.008
They're all dressing
as characters from my book!

08:07.051 --> 08:08.705
Multiple children
are doing this?

08:08.749 --> 08:11.752
Apparently it's become
some kind of a cult.

08:11.795 --> 08:12.970
You mean a cult classic?

08:13.014 --> 08:14.929
Exactly.
Like "Heaven's Gate."

08:14.972 --> 08:16.539
Come with me,
you can see for yourself.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.410
I love that
you're into Halloween now,

08:18.454 --> 08:20.674
but I have my haunted house
at Cattleman's to work on.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.589
I have to stop by
the blood bank, get supplies.

08:22.632 --> 08:24.591
If you don't want O-negative,
it's actually pretty cheap.

08:24.634 --> 08:25.940
Louis!

08:25.983 --> 08:29.378
My book is as important to me
as Halloween is to you.

08:29.421 --> 08:31.467
If you come with me,
I'll tell everybody

08:31.511 --> 08:33.034
yougot me on board
with Halloween

08:33.077 --> 08:34.644
and not some little girl.

08:34.688 --> 08:35.602
Hmm.

08:35.645 --> 08:36.907
That does help.

08:36.951 --> 08:38.648
But if I go with you
to find your fans,

08:38.692 --> 08:40.607
you have to go with me
to the restaurant afterwards.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.260
Deal.

08:42.304 --> 08:43.348
Uh, just curious,

08:43.392 --> 08:44.741
but did you make
any kids cry today?

08:44.785 --> 08:46.700
Oh, yeah.
Principal Hunter too.

08:46.743 --> 08:47.831
But that's his own fault

08:47.875 --> 08:49.790
for putting his kid
in the costume contest.

08:49.833 --> 08:50.704
Mm.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.577
I got Grandma's sleeping bag
in the freezer.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.274
Trying to blast the funk out
with a blow-dryer

08:56.318 --> 08:57.580
was the...wrong choice.

09:02.846 --> 09:04.718
What the hell
is going on here, guys?

09:04.761 --> 09:06.720
I wasn't kidding
about the drugs.

09:06.763 --> 09:08.243
I'm surprised
you have to ask.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.288
I'm renowned physician
Dr. Dre.

09:10.332 --> 09:11.812
Emery:
And I'm Snoopy Dog.

09:11.855 --> 09:13.596
You can be Iced Tea.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.729
Did you say "IcedTea"?

09:15.772 --> 09:16.817
It's Ice-T!

09:16.860 --> 09:18.819
We want to do
a brothers costume.

09:18.862 --> 09:21.169
Yeah, we wanna have
a threesome.

09:21.212 --> 09:23.475
O...kay.
So, never say that.

09:23.519 --> 09:26.609
But I would be down
to do a costume with you two.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.263
Well, if we aren't gonna go
as the hard freestylers,

09:28.306 --> 09:29.481
who are we gonna be?

09:29.525 --> 09:30.657
It's Halloween.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.223
All the stores
are out of the good stuff.

09:32.267 --> 09:34.443
Chill. We'll think of it
on the fly, yo!

09:34.486 --> 09:36.663
Chill. We can think of somethingon the fly, yo!

09:37.664 --> 09:39.622
That was a pretty good me
you did there.

09:39.666 --> 09:42.799
Hey, what if we dressed up
as each other?

09:42.843 --> 09:44.540
Yeah, that's actually
not a bad idea.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.628
♪ Yeah

09:45.672 --> 09:47.891
"Not bad"
is my sweet spot.

09:52.330 --> 09:53.462
Grandma!

09:53.505 --> 09:54.637
How'd you get back
in your sleeping bag?

09:54.681 --> 09:56.726
Now I gotta start over!

10:00.730 --> 10:02.123
This is the address
they gave you?

10:02.166 --> 10:03.472
I don't understand.

10:03.515 --> 10:06.257
This makes
perfect sense.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.476
Sure, for a mugging.

10:07.519 --> 10:09.826
She gave me the wrong address
on purpose.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.088
In Chapter 5 of the book,

10:11.132 --> 10:13.221
Jennifer Hong gets a lead
from the lady robot

10:13.264 --> 10:14.788
to the location
of the bazooka factory,

10:14.831 --> 10:16.485
only to find...

10:16.528 --> 10:18.487
an empty lot.

10:18.530 --> 10:20.445
Turns out, the factory
was down the street.

10:20.489 --> 10:21.533
Twist.

10:22.926 --> 10:24.493
It's got to be
one of these houses.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.321
We just got
to "walk the beat,"

10:26.364 --> 10:27.452
"work the case,"

10:27.496 --> 10:28.671
"follow
the bazooka shells."

10:28.715 --> 10:30.760
Jessica, two adults
can't go door-to-door

10:30.804 --> 10:32.109
asking if
a little girl is home.

10:32.153 --> 10:33.894
It's creepy,
even for Halloween.

10:33.937 --> 10:35.417
You're right.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.899
Do you still have
that stuff in the van
for the haunted house?

10:38.942 --> 10:41.031
Yeah, you watched me
pack the whole van by myself,

10:41.075 --> 10:42.293
heckling me to go faster.

10:42.337 --> 10:43.294
Well,
did you go faster?

10:43.338 --> 10:44.731
Yeah.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.256
Hi,
I'm Mad Cow Disease.

10:48.299 --> 10:49.823
And I am
an evil Irish toddler.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.041
Chucky
from "Child's Play."

10:51.085 --> 10:53.914
Speaking of children playing,
does a cute 12-year-old girl

10:53.957 --> 10:56.133
with an active imagination
and a great taste in books

10:56.177 --> 10:57.569
live here?

10:57.613 --> 11:00.485
Uh...what she means is --
trick-or-treat!

11:00.529 --> 11:01.748
Real smooth, Jessica.

11:01.791 --> 11:03.924
One down.

11:03.967 --> 11:04.707
Hong's on the case!

11:04.751 --> 11:06.709
Slow down,
I'm wearing 6-inch hooves!

11:09.625 --> 11:11.758
Wait,
you'redressed as Evan?

11:11.801 --> 11:13.760
I thought Iwas going
as the little man.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.631
No, Eddie,
you're supposed to be Emery

11:15.675 --> 11:16.980
and I'msupposed to
be Evan!

11:17.024 --> 11:18.852
Why'd they give us all
"E" names?

11:18.895 --> 11:20.244
Very confusing!

11:27.034 --> 11:28.122
Who the hell are you?

11:28.165 --> 11:29.427
I'm Evan.

11:29.471 --> 11:30.994
Why are you both
dressed as me?

11:31.038 --> 11:32.213
Because
Emery messed up.

11:32.256 --> 11:33.388
What's yourexcuse?

11:33.431 --> 11:34.737
I was dressing up
as Eddie,

11:34.781 --> 11:36.652
but then I got worried
Emery would feel left out,

11:36.696 --> 11:38.523
and I didn't want
to hurt anyone's feelings,

11:38.567 --> 11:40.525
so I put my own clothes
back on.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.223
Dude, nobody cares
who you dress as.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.138
Yeah,
we wouldn't be upset.

11:44.181 --> 11:45.530
Yeah, bro,
it's all out of love.

11:45.574 --> 11:46.793
Just go change,
and we will too.

11:46.836 --> 11:48.620
Hang on, hang on,
hang on.

11:48.664 --> 11:50.448
Let's not be
too hasty here, fellas.

11:50.492 --> 11:52.407
Not to strum
my own viola here,

11:52.450 --> 11:55.192
but we all do look pretty cute
dressed as me.

11:56.498 --> 11:59.022
Hmm. I did put a lot of thoughtand time into my bangs.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.763
Not to mention
it took me 30 minutes

12:00.807 --> 12:02.199
to stuff myself
into these shorts.

12:02.243 --> 12:04.027
I had to wear
my thinnest underwear.

12:04.071 --> 12:05.420
Look at us.

12:05.463 --> 12:06.813
Three Evans,
one Halloween?

12:08.249 --> 12:10.033
We have to promise
not to run tonight,

12:10.077 --> 12:12.601
because these shorts
are up there.

12:14.429 --> 12:17.345
Jessica, we hit up almost everyhouse in this neighborhood.

12:17.388 --> 12:19.608
I'm starting to think this
Brain-head girl doesn't exist.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.044
Maybe we should just
call it.

12:21.088 --> 12:21.958
Oh, come on!

12:22.002 --> 12:24.221
Just a few more houses,
please?

12:24.265 --> 12:26.049
We've got to be close.

12:26.093 --> 12:27.224
I can feel it in my gut.

12:27.268 --> 12:28.791
That's all the gum. You're not
supposed to swallow it.

12:28.835 --> 12:31.620
Well, they shouldn't have
made it taste so good.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.187
All right, one more house
and then Cattleman's.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.623
Fine.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.062
Trick-or-treat!

12:39.106 --> 12:42.022
Do you happen to have a sister
who likes to read?

12:42.065 --> 12:44.024
Specifically,
adult sci-fi noir?

12:44.067 --> 12:45.939
Oh, you mean
my little sister, Henrietta?

12:45.982 --> 12:47.941
She and her nerd friends
went to the graveyard

12:47.984 --> 12:49.638
to have
some stupid book party.

12:49.681 --> 12:51.988
The graveyard,
of course!

12:52.032 --> 12:53.598
Really?
So you do have a fan club.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.600
Well, a cult.

12:55.644 --> 12:56.993
Thank you for your help.

12:57.037 --> 12:59.430
Take care of these wrappers
for me?

12:59.474 --> 13:01.432
Another
Halloween miracle!

13:01.476 --> 13:03.086
The graveyard is on the way
to the restaurant.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.480
We can go see your
fans and still get to
Cattleman's in time.

13:05.523 --> 13:06.873
We're not going
to the graveyard.

13:06.916 --> 13:07.917
Wait, what?

13:07.961 --> 13:08.962
We're going
to the school.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.224
The school?

13:10.267 --> 13:12.617
No, she specifically said
they're at the graveyard.

13:12.661 --> 13:15.925
Yes, but in my book,
the graveyard isthe school.

13:15.969 --> 13:18.101
That's where the killer
buried all the bodies.

13:18.145 --> 13:19.929
Did you not read the book
till the end?

13:19.973 --> 13:21.235
Of...course I did.

13:21.278 --> 13:24.064
Um, but, again,
I know Halloween,

13:24.107 --> 13:25.892
and no kid
goes to a school today.

13:25.935 --> 13:27.110
Kids go to graveyards.

13:27.154 --> 13:28.459
I am the detective here.

13:28.503 --> 13:30.331
Look, I never
told anyone this,

13:30.374 --> 13:32.637
but Jennifer Hong
is based...

13:32.681 --> 13:34.901
on Jessica Huang.

13:34.944 --> 13:36.859
Okay, fine.
Do whatever you want.

13:36.903 --> 13:39.079
I'm going to my haunted house
at Cattleman's.

13:41.081 --> 13:44.127
Well, instead of a Mad Cow,
you should've been a baby,

13:44.171 --> 13:46.782
because that's
what you're acting like!

13:48.305 --> 13:50.133
Here you go.

13:50.177 --> 13:51.091
Happy Halloween.

13:51.134 --> 13:52.527
How cute.
So cute.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.529
Trick-or-treat!Trick-or-treat!Trick-or-treat!

13:54.572 --> 13:56.357
Hey!

13:56.400 --> 13:59.664
If my instincts are correct,you're Buffy the Vampire Slayer

13:59.708 --> 14:00.491
and...?

14:00.535 --> 14:02.580
And I'm Marvin the angel!

14:02.624 --> 14:03.581
No, it's just Angel.

14:03.625 --> 14:04.931
I don't watch
her programs.

14:04.974 --> 14:07.150
So, guys, uh,
who are you supposed to be?

14:07.194 --> 14:09.152
Why don't you guess?

14:09.196 --> 14:10.371
Why don't you guess?Why don't you guess?

14:10.980 --> 14:12.982
Oh, my God!
Three Evans!

14:13.940 --> 14:16.377
Three Evans,
that'd be Mommy's dream.

14:16.420 --> 14:18.335
Yeah,I can see it now. And I like it.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.816
I'm Evan, and my waistline
doubles as my nipple line.

14:22.078 --> 14:24.385
I organize my undies
by the color of the rainbow!

14:24.428 --> 14:26.300
Oh, what light spectrum
do youuse

14:26.343 --> 14:28.693
to organize
your unmentionables?

14:28.737 --> 14:31.044
I discovered sports
because of Brandi Chastain.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.132
Hey!

14:32.175 --> 14:34.047
And by "sports,"
I mean my anatomy!

14:35.004 --> 14:37.311
I was just trying
to have some fun,

14:37.354 --> 14:39.748
until you mother-brothers
decided to ruin it!

14:41.793 --> 14:43.534
Ooh.
That's a new walk.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.014
I think the joke's over.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.494
Yeah, I know.

14:56.199 --> 14:58.332
Louis, you forgot
the decorations in the van,

14:58.375 --> 15:01.030
so I brought them here
before I went to the school!

15:02.423 --> 15:04.164
Hello?

15:04.207 --> 15:06.122
Louis?

15:08.429 --> 15:11.214
Red!
Don't die on me, damn it!

15:11.258 --> 15:12.128
Aah!

15:12.172 --> 15:13.303
Mrs. Huang?

15:13.347 --> 15:15.175
Ohh! Thank God
you're not dead.

15:15.218 --> 15:17.177
We would have had to disclose
when we sell the place.

15:22.269 --> 15:25.011
What the hell
is going on?

15:26.273 --> 15:28.144
I can't tell you.
Louis swore me to secrecy.

15:28.188 --> 15:29.580
We took a blood oath.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.408
Well, Idid.
Louis is squeamish.

15:31.452 --> 15:33.367
Are you really gonna
make me ask twice?

15:33.410 --> 15:34.585
All right, fine.

15:34.629 --> 15:37.197
I scare easily, and Louis said
I could hang out here,

15:37.240 --> 15:38.981
away from the Halloween madness,if I kept his secret.

15:39.025 --> 15:41.157
That's not what I was asking.
I wanna know --

15:41.201 --> 15:43.159
Why I was sleeping facedown?
Fine!

15:43.203 --> 15:45.640
I have extreme back pain,
and it's the only way
I can get comfortable.

15:45.683 --> 15:47.990
I don't care how you rest.
I want to know w--

15:48.034 --> 15:49.252
How I first hurt my back?

15:49.296 --> 15:51.254
It was 1997,
last day of autumn,

15:51.298 --> 15:52.821
Trish bet me
I couldn't do a handstand.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.214
Tell me...

15:54.257 --> 15:56.781
what Louis...

15:56.825 --> 15:57.782
did.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.001
I'm sorry, I can't.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.003
Well, here we are.

16:01.047 --> 16:02.396
This was bound to happen.

16:02.439 --> 16:05.138
His real wife and his work wife,caught in a conflict.

16:09.055 --> 16:10.360
It would be such a shame

16:10.404 --> 16:13.015
if all of these sugar packets
fell on the floor.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.016
The assistant manager

16:14.060 --> 16:16.410
would have to bend over
and pick them all up.

16:16.453 --> 16:18.368
Oh, you wouldn't.

16:20.762 --> 16:22.372
Oops.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.418
Oh! My L5-S1!

16:24.461 --> 16:26.159
Okay,
I'll tell you everything!

16:30.076 --> 16:31.077
Hey, Grandma.
Nice Cartman.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.862
He notices
when they kill Kenny.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.516
Evan's inside.

16:35.559 --> 16:37.039
He's upset.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.301
I don't even
understand why.

16:38.345 --> 16:40.260
It was his idea
for us to dress up as him.

16:40.303 --> 16:42.044
We were just trying
to have fun.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.915
How would you like it
if I dressed up

16:43.959 --> 16:47.223
like a goofy giant
or Johnny Fragile Hands?

16:47.267 --> 16:48.224
Hmm?

16:48.268 --> 16:49.269
Goofy?!

16:49.312 --> 16:50.444
Fragile?

16:50.487 --> 16:52.098
Delicate, sure,
but fragile?!

16:52.141 --> 16:53.229
You see?

16:53.273 --> 16:55.884
It doesn't feel great
being mocked, does it?

16:58.365 --> 17:00.454
Come on, Emery.
Let's go make this up to him.

17:00.497 --> 17:02.760
Here's your sleeping bag,
G-Ma.

17:02.804 --> 17:06.286
No, Kenny!
This is my pot pie!

17:06.329 --> 17:09.767
Where are my Cheesy Poofs?!
Where are my Cheesy Poofs?!

17:09.811 --> 17:12.292
Screw you guys!
I'm going home!

17:16.818 --> 17:18.211
Jessica: You found us!

17:18.254 --> 17:19.777
Good sleuthing!

17:19.821 --> 17:22.084
It is so nice to see
so many characters

17:22.128 --> 17:24.869
from "A Case of a Knife
to the Brain" in one place!

17:24.913 --> 17:26.958
The one-armed
sea captain...

17:27.002 --> 17:29.091
the clumsy
crane operator...

17:29.135 --> 17:31.485
the anemic
ski instructor...

17:31.528 --> 17:32.964
Bazooka Phil.

17:33.922 --> 17:35.184
In the original draft,

17:35.228 --> 17:37.012
all of these characters
were prostitutes.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.013
Henrietta: What?

17:38.057 --> 17:39.971
Wait,
how do you know that?

17:40.015 --> 17:42.235
Because I am
the original Brain-head.

17:42.278 --> 17:43.236
I wrote it.

17:45.803 --> 17:47.153
It's her!

17:47.196 --> 17:49.764
I can't believe the mind behind"A Case of a Knife to the Brain"

17:49.807 --> 17:50.765
is at our party!

17:50.808 --> 17:52.897
We're all huge fans
of your book.

17:52.941 --> 17:55.248
Ohh! I wish
there were more of you.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.163
Us too!

17:57.206 --> 17:59.295
Well, do you know what helps
boost sales for a work of art?

17:59.339 --> 18:01.906
My idol, Stephen King,

18:01.950 --> 18:04.126
just got hit by a minivan
this summer.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.519
And while he was
in critical condition,

18:05.562 --> 18:07.564
sales of his books
skyrocketed.

18:08.652 --> 18:09.653
What are you saying?

18:10.741 --> 18:12.265
There's a switchblade
in my purse.

18:13.353 --> 18:16.747
Take it out, aim for
the fleshy part of my thigh.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.271
Good luck finding it,
but once you do, just --

18:18.314 --> 18:20.055
All right,
show's over, kids!

18:20.099 --> 18:21.404
She's kidding.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.189
Thank you! Good night!

18:23.232 --> 18:25.147
I set up refreshments
out back.

18:26.540 --> 18:27.976
I knew it!

18:28.019 --> 18:29.369
How did you
figure it out?

18:29.412 --> 18:32.415
Please, Louis,
I'm a detective novelist.

18:32.459 --> 18:33.721
Plus, Trent told me
everything.

18:33.764 --> 18:36.985
I need more confidants
my own age.

18:37.028 --> 18:38.291
Fine,
I planned the whole thing.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.336
I realized no matter
how much I told you,

18:40.380 --> 18:42.599
you'd have to experiencethe magic of Halloween yourself,

18:42.643 --> 18:45.341
so I planted Henrietta
at the costume contest.

18:45.385 --> 18:48.344
Then you lured me
into that wild goose chase,

18:48.388 --> 18:50.346
just to get me to go
trick-or-treating in costume.

18:50.390 --> 18:52.435
Well, you went through more gumthan I expected,

18:52.479 --> 18:53.436
but I saw you having fun.

18:54.916 --> 18:57.962
It wasfun emptying
those "Please take one" bowls.

18:58.006 --> 18:59.094
Idiots.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.313
Honor system?

19:00.356 --> 19:02.315
I'm a demon doll.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.404
It only went wrong
when you didn't listen
about the graveyard.

19:04.447 --> 19:06.362
After that curveball,
I needed an excuse

19:06.406 --> 19:08.451
to get the kids
from the graveyard to here.

19:08.495 --> 19:12.194
Well, you finally got me
to like Halloween.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.196
I just wanted to spend
my favorite holiday

19:14.240 --> 19:15.328
with my favorite person.

19:15.371 --> 19:17.765
I give it
a 76 out of 100.

19:17.808 --> 19:20.333
A passing score.
I'll take it.

19:24.511 --> 19:26.121
Yo, what we did
was mad messed up.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.297
Sorry, let me get my bangs
out of my face

19:28.341 --> 19:30.343
so I can tell you
I'm sorry too.

19:30.386 --> 19:31.822
We took it
a little too far.

19:31.866 --> 19:33.911
Yo, yo, yo, did I tell you
I have a girlfriend

19:33.955 --> 19:34.912
and I like rap music?

19:36.392 --> 19:38.438
That was a pretty good Eddie.

19:38.481 --> 19:40.831
We're sorry. We didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.617
It's okay.
I overreacted.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.227
I didn't mean
to ruin our Halloween.

19:45.271 --> 19:46.359
Ruined?
It's not ruined.

19:46.402 --> 19:48.361
See, the cool thing
about being older

19:48.404 --> 19:50.145
is you can trick-or-treat
waylater.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.451
But who are we
gonna go as?

19:52.756 --> 19:53.714
Hola.

19:58.327 --> 20:00.938
All right!
Some feminine insects!

20:00.982 --> 20:02.592
We're Powerpuff Girls.

20:02.636 --> 20:03.724
Oh.

20:03.767 --> 20:06.030
Well, great costumes,
whatever they are.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.599
Thanks for
handing out candy with me.

20:09.643 --> 20:12.472
It's the least I could do afterall you did for me tonight.

20:12.515 --> 20:13.690
Fun, right?

20:13.734 --> 20:16.606
It's not as dumb
as it looks.

20:16.650 --> 20:17.694
Raisins?!

20:17.738 --> 20:19.914
You ruined my childhood,
bitches!

20:19.957 --> 20:21.916
Oh! What a holiday.

20:21.959 --> 20:24.701
Oh! I just caught one
in my mouth! Gross!

20:24.745 --> 20:27.574
I'll draw their fire.
You go get the big carrots,
and then we'll smack 'em!

20:51.511 --> 20:53.077
Can't say
I feel confident in this.

20:53.121 --> 20:55.863
You? At least you're covered.I'm showing a lot of skin here.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.125
I can't breathe!

20:57.168 --> 20:58.909
I look like
a mariachi Winnie the Pooh!

20:59.823 --> 21:01.477
Mine still fits!

21:01.521 --> 21:03.305
Glad I skipped breakfast.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.786
Sorry, Evan, I don't think
this is gonna work.

21:05.829 --> 21:08.571
Just go grab the sheetfrom our beds and go as ghosts.

21:08.615 --> 21:11.487
Fine, but not before
one last salute

21:11.531 --> 21:13.141
for old times' sake.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.539
All: Hunh!
The Three Amigos!

21:19.582 --> 21:21.758
Something ripped.
But I don't know where.

21:21.802 --> 21:22.803
Close your eyes!

21:26.589 --> 21:28.199
Think that's a good idea.

21:28.243 --> 21:29.549
Hmm.
