WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.407 --> 00:09.342
(Gaz) The Geordie squad are back.

00:09.409 --> 00:11.678
This time, it's gonna be massive.

00:11.745 --> 00:14.247
Fuck off, Newcastle!
(cheering)

00:14.314 --> 00:17.417
We're on a mission
round all the party islands.

00:17.484 --> 00:19.819
(screaming)

00:19.886 --> 00:21.321
(screams)

00:22.355 --> 00:24.624
Things are about to get
Lionel Messi.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.129
There's gonna be pool parties.

00:29.195 --> 00:30.330
Boat parties.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.299
Paint parties.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.735
The biggest parties
of our fucking lives.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.104
More necking on.

00:39.305 --> 00:40.507
Oh, shit.

00:42.108 --> 00:43.610
Shitloads of fucking.

00:46.546 --> 00:49.215
Belly flop! Belly flop!
(laughter)

00:49.282 --> 00:50.850
Let's fucking do this!

00:53.153 --> 00:55.855
There's gonna be carnage.
Fucking little slag!

00:55.922 --> 00:57.957
(screaming, shouting)

00:59.926 --> 01:01.961
Kick-offs.
(screaming)

01:02.028 --> 01:03.663
Marnie, Marnie!

01:03.730 --> 01:05.665
Fuck!
(sobbing)

01:05.732 --> 01:07.467
Drama.
Fuck off!

01:10.069 --> 01:11.704
Oh, my God!
(siren blares)

01:11.771 --> 01:14.107
Let's get fucking mortal!

01:15.408 --> 01:17.877
This is the ultimate
party island crawl.

01:20.447 --> 01:21.448
(farts)

01:21.514 --> 01:24.451
Welcome to the girls' room,
you little radge packet!

01:24.517 --> 01:27.120
Maga, here we come!

01:27.187 --> 01:30.457
Me and Marnie finally banged
and tried to make a go of it,

01:30.523 --> 01:31.724
but it didn't happen.

01:31.791 --> 01:35.628
Hopefully, sun, sea and sand will
help with that this time. Aaron!

01:35.695 --> 01:38.064
Scott's pulled a random.
Let him crack on.

01:38.131 --> 01:41.601
Marnie thinks she looks sexy.
She looks like an idiot. Marnie!

01:41.668 --> 01:43.269
He's such a buzzkill.

01:43.336 --> 01:46.739
I'm taking a chance with Chloe.
Better not let us down. (laughs)

01:46.806 --> 01:48.208
I think I might love him.

01:49.375 --> 01:52.278
I just wanna get you naked
and do things in that shag pad.

01:52.345 --> 01:56.015
Am I seeing things?
Back off, big tits, he's mine.

01:57.550 --> 01:59.652
(sighs) For fuck's sake, Chloe.

01:59.719 --> 02:03.456
No chat-up lines, no compliments,
nothing. You're a dead end, Aaron.

02:03.523 --> 02:05.892
My head's all over the place.
Fuck this shit.

02:07.026 --> 02:10.096
Chicken fucking nuggets?
(shouting)

02:10.163 --> 02:12.899
I am fucking done with her.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.834
Yeah, bitches!

02:17.003 --> 02:19.172
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:19.239 --> 02:21.708
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

02:21.774 --> 02:24.277
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:24.344 --> 02:26.446
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:26.513 --> 02:29.082
I'm radge and I wrap lads
around my little finger.

02:29.148 --> 02:30.984
I'm preened to perfection.

02:31.050 --> 02:32.919
I'm totally crackers me, like.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.455
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:35.522 --> 02:37.423
Me banter's pure naughty.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.559
I'm fit, flirty
and I've got double Fs.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.561
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:53.273 --> 02:55.909
(Holly) Me and Chantelle
slept in the shag pad

02:55.975 --> 02:59.145
cos Chloe kicked off,
cos she thought Marty was flirting.

02:59.212 --> 03:01.447
Me and Marty do not flirt
and that is that.

03:01.514 --> 03:05.818
For her to come at me and say, like,
there's this flirting going on,

03:05.885 --> 03:07.720
and getting me involved in shit,

03:07.787 --> 03:10.156
I just think
it's a bit fucking stupid.

03:10.223 --> 03:12.559
Is Chloe actually being serious?

03:12.625 --> 03:15.094
Like Holly would go
anywhere near Marty.

03:15.161 --> 03:17.564
Chloe, you really need
to sort your head out.

03:17.630 --> 03:22.135
I think she just wants to go acka
for the sake of going acka.

03:22.201 --> 03:24.771
I am enjoying being happy Holly
at the moment.

03:24.837 --> 03:27.707
Bullshit like this brings me down.
I don't need that.

03:30.243 --> 03:31.411
(groaning)

03:33.046 --> 03:35.915
(laughter)

03:36.916 --> 03:40.119
Last night was fucking wicked
till we got back, like.

03:40.186 --> 03:43.122
Last night, me and Chloe
were meant to be in the shag pad.

03:43.189 --> 03:45.625
Instead, she said
I was flirting with Holly

03:45.692 --> 03:47.961
and chucked chicken nuggets
off my face.

03:48.027 --> 03:51.297
Mate, I'm not gonna talk to her again
in my life.

03:51.364 --> 03:55.568
I was even saying to Chloe last
night, Marty, I can't defend her.

03:55.635 --> 03:58.571
At all. Cos there was no reason
to kick off with you.

03:58.638 --> 04:00.506
I do think Chloe was in the wrong.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.376
There's trouble brewing
between the boys and girls.

04:03.443 --> 04:05.144
I'm gonna be stuck in the middle.

04:09.282 --> 04:11.918
That's why Marnie kicked off.
She can fuck off.

04:11.985 --> 04:14.120
Last night,
Marnie said I was a dead end.

04:14.187 --> 04:17.757
But she also said she loves us.
That girl is messed up in the head.

04:17.824 --> 04:18.958
I need to have a chat.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.998
Me and Marty have a connection.

04:25.064 --> 04:27.367
I kicked off
cos I thought he was flirting.

04:27.433 --> 04:30.503
I really like him a lot.
I've still got my guard up, though.

04:30.570 --> 04:31.804
I don't wanna get hurt.

04:31.871 --> 04:35.341
It's proper, like, here.
I can't see anything. It's here.

04:35.408 --> 04:37.744
I can barely see you.
(both laugh)

04:37.810 --> 04:41.648
If Marty likes us,
why isn't he giving me compliments?

04:41.714 --> 04:44.684
I've got loads of nice assets,
and mine are real.

04:44.751 --> 04:48.054
What's happening with Aaron?
We're just both dead stubborn.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.090
And for some reason, we don't work.
It's really weird.

04:51.157 --> 04:53.559
Usually, when I meet a boy,
things develop.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.361
With Aaron, nothing changes.

04:55.428 --> 04:58.564
We're still having
the same pathetic arguments.

05:06.406 --> 05:08.341
(phone rings)

05:08.408 --> 05:10.777
(Holly) The phone's ringing.

05:10.843 --> 05:14.347
A fake-tanned, middle-aged Geordie
bird is about to bark orders.

05:14.414 --> 05:15.948
Hello, Anna.

05:17.884 --> 05:18.918
Mm-hmm.

05:21.888 --> 05:25.258
We are hosting one of the first
big boat parties of the season.

05:25.324 --> 05:26.325
Bring it on.

05:29.562 --> 05:30.897
Right, OK. No bother.

05:30.963 --> 05:32.532
I've never had a boat party,

05:32.598 --> 05:35.334
but I'm a bit nervous
in case I get seasick.

05:35.401 --> 05:37.904
Whitey all over the top deck.
(whooping)

05:37.970 --> 05:40.773
(chanting) Boat party! Boat party!

05:40.840 --> 05:43.209
Bring on this party.
Let's fucking have it.

05:46.813 --> 05:48.147
Get to the harbour,

05:48.214 --> 05:50.817
fuck me, is that Jack Sparrow
and his radgie pals?

05:50.883 --> 05:52.985
Oi, oi. Shiver me timbers.

05:53.052 --> 05:56.055
(Aaron laughs) Really?!

05:56.122 --> 06:00.093
Anna's got us dressed
as fucking pirates. That's not cool.

06:00.159 --> 06:01.561
We look like idiots.

06:01.627 --> 06:03.963
Everyone's whinging
about these costumes,

06:04.030 --> 06:06.265
but all the lasses
pure love the look of me.

06:06.332 --> 06:10.002
Forget the Jolly Roger,
it's all about the naughty todger.

06:12.271 --> 06:15.341
Oi, listen,
let's get ready to fucking party.

06:15.408 --> 06:17.810
Welcome to the pirate ship!

06:17.877 --> 06:20.279
Oi-oi!
(cheering)

06:26.486 --> 06:28.187
The boat party's bouncing.

06:28.254 --> 06:31.824
Now let's do some actual work.
It's time for a drinking game.

06:31.891 --> 06:36.329
We're gonna play a game called,
"Oh, argh, shiver me timbers."

06:36.395 --> 06:37.597
So if I start and I go...

06:37.663 --> 06:40.299
Nathan, I don't know
what you're going on about.

06:40.366 --> 06:42.401
Aaron, your go.
What?

06:42.468 --> 06:45.805
Oh, argh, shiver me timbers.
Oh, argh, shiver me timbers.

06:47.173 --> 06:50.676
Nathan, give it a rest, mate.
This shit is getting boring.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.412
Just say "oh".
Just say "oh" or "argh". Argh.

06:53.479 --> 06:56.415
Argh. It's your turn.
It's coming back.

06:56.482 --> 06:59.185
I'm trying hard
to get this pirate game working,

06:59.252 --> 07:01.287
but no fucker's taking it seriously.

07:01.354 --> 07:05.525
Right, guys. Fuck the game.
Down your drink. Let's get pissed.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.928
(shouts indistinctly)

07:08.995 --> 07:10.563
Anna's done well here.

07:10.630 --> 07:13.399
It makes me wanna
take back every single insult.

07:13.466 --> 07:17.970
But then I think, fuck that. Cheers
for the free fanny and peev, tosser.

07:22.241 --> 07:25.478
I've always fancied a Titanic
moment, like Kate Winstant.

07:25.545 --> 07:27.280
But she didn't get her tits out.

07:36.255 --> 07:38.090
I haven't spoke to Marnie all day,

07:38.157 --> 07:40.293
but she's looking fit
in that costume,

07:40.359 --> 07:42.862
so, howay,
let's get this fucking shit sorted.

07:42.929 --> 07:44.597
If he's gonna piss us off...

07:46.833 --> 07:49.101
Me and Aaron
argued again last night.

07:49.168 --> 07:52.972
I dunno what he's gonna say, but we
need to move forward or leave it.

07:53.039 --> 07:54.540
This could be make or break.

07:54.607 --> 07:58.244
When we are good, we're good,
but when we kick off, it's shite.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.413
I've liked Marnie
from the day I met her.

08:00.479 --> 08:02.548
But we've never made it official.

08:02.615 --> 08:04.884
I think we owe it to ourselves
to give it a go.

08:04.951 --> 08:07.453
I don't get what you want.
What do you want?

08:07.520 --> 08:10.556
Where's it gonna go, Aaron?
I can't continue like this.

08:10.623 --> 08:13.626
You either need to leave us,
or make us your girlfriend.

08:13.693 --> 08:16.762
You should take things
to the next level and you never do.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.267
I'm gonna ask you a question.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.702
Let's fucking do this.

08:22.768 --> 08:24.537
Do you wanna be my girlfriend?

08:24.604 --> 08:27.440
Oh, my God! What the hell?

08:27.506 --> 08:29.709
Yes, I do.
You do?

08:29.775 --> 08:32.611
That's all I ever wanted.
Well, it's took a long time.

08:32.678 --> 08:35.414
Who'd have thought
them words would come out of me?

08:35.481 --> 08:37.917
I'm shocked,
but I'm fucking buzzing.

08:37.984 --> 08:39.919
I need to change my Facebook status.

08:39.986 --> 08:43.022
I can't believe
I'm finally Aaron's girlfriend.

08:43.089 --> 08:45.625
This is massive.
I can't wait to tell the girls.

08:45.691 --> 08:48.427
I've got something to tell yous.
What?

08:48.494 --> 08:50.229
We're together.

08:50.296 --> 08:52.265
(screaming)

08:55.534 --> 08:59.372
I am so happy for Marnie and Aaron.
They're finally in a relationship.

08:59.438 --> 09:00.773
They've made that step.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.576
I've seen yous go from,
like, day one together,

09:03.643 --> 09:06.178
and it makes us emotional
thinking about it.

09:06.245 --> 09:07.880
I could probably cry about it.

09:07.947 --> 09:11.317
It's great to see love on a boat.
Just like the Titanic.

09:11.384 --> 09:15.288
We can't neck on any more, can we?
Yeah, you've gotta stop doing that.

09:17.590 --> 09:19.759
For God's sake.
We can do it on the sly.

09:19.825 --> 09:21.560
I'm gonna have to change my ways.

09:21.627 --> 09:24.864
Shit. I'm already going into this
with a big secret.

09:24.931 --> 09:28.034
I should've told Aaron I was
bisexual when I had the chance.

09:29.535 --> 09:32.338
(Gaz) What?
Everybody's congratulating Marnie.

09:32.405 --> 09:36.108
Wait there. We need to talk to Aaron
and find out what is going on.

09:36.175 --> 09:38.244
Sit down.
This could be a big moment.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.478
Gaz and Scott come up

09:39.545 --> 09:42.848
and it looks like they're gonna
rip the piss clean out of me.

09:44.717 --> 09:48.054
"Do you wanna be my girlfriend?"
And she went, "Yes."

09:48.120 --> 09:49.188
You all right?

09:49.255 --> 09:51.924
I've got a temperature.
He's got a temperature!

09:51.991 --> 09:53.926
Sun stroke. (laughs)

09:53.993 --> 09:56.462
The good thing is,
now I'm in a relationship,

09:56.529 --> 09:57.863
the sex should be on tap.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.333
Mate, it's your decision.
I'm happy for you.

10:00.399 --> 10:02.134
I'll stick by you no matter what.

10:02.201 --> 10:05.104
I don't think Aaron's
thought this through properly.

10:05.171 --> 10:06.973
Now him and Marnie are together,

10:07.039 --> 10:09.976
it means he's gonna get less sex
than he already gets,

10:10.042 --> 10:11.844
which is fucking none.

10:15.748 --> 10:19.652
I'm not ready to go on the pull yet,
but I am used to having a girl.

10:19.719 --> 10:23.789
I'm pissed, Chantelle's looking fit.
Fuck it, I'm gonna flirt.

10:25.391 --> 10:27.259
I'm mortal-drunk on this boat,

10:27.326 --> 10:31.263
and out of all people,
Gary is turning on the charm.

10:33.632 --> 10:36.969
What's going on here, like?
Have I had one too many sangrias?

10:37.036 --> 10:39.839
Or can I see Gaz
cracking on with Chantelle?

10:39.905 --> 10:41.440
Aye, aye, captain.

10:43.576 --> 10:47.346
I'm smashed. All of a sudden,
I find myself with Chantelle. Shit!

10:47.413 --> 10:49.348
This is getting quite interesting.

10:49.415 --> 10:52.885
We're the only single people
that can actually, like, flirt.

10:52.952 --> 10:56.522
Gary's going on about
how he's single, blah, blah, blah.

10:56.589 --> 11:00.926
So, I'm on the boat party, having a
good time. I think we should neck on.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.194
What the fuck?

11:08.968 --> 11:10.169
Oh, shit!

11:11.170 --> 11:14.206
What is going on?
I didn't know they liked each other.

11:16.375 --> 11:19.879
Holly will kick off.
Who ate my fucking chicken nuggets?

11:22.915 --> 11:24.917
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

11:27.987 --> 11:28.187
.

11:30.723 --> 11:30.923
.

11:30.990 --> 11:35.428
(Chloe) Geordie Shore contains
lads and lasses having sex.

11:35.494 --> 11:38.998
If you're easily offended,
do not watch. You have been warned.

11:46.005 --> 11:48.741
Me and the lads are getting ready
for a night out.

11:48.808 --> 11:52.344
I love getting ready, me,
cos it's all I ever fucking do.

11:52.411 --> 11:55.247
If that's what work's like,
I'll work every time.

11:55.314 --> 11:58.084
I had a mint time on that boat
and had a pure radge day.

11:58.150 --> 12:01.987
I don't know if I was pissed really,
but somebody got a girlfriend.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.422
(laughter)

12:03.489 --> 12:05.624
We'll give you the shag pad tonight.

12:05.691 --> 12:09.495
That's right, boys. Now me and
Marnie are boyfriend and girlfriend,

12:09.562 --> 12:12.565
you may as well kiss goodbye
to the shag pad. It's mine.

12:12.631 --> 12:15.968
I could've sworn you were
getting close to Chantelle today.

12:16.035 --> 12:17.203
No lie, kid.

12:17.269 --> 12:20.739
Earlier at the boat party,
Marty's seen me flirt with Chantelle,

12:20.806 --> 12:24.610
but he doesn't know we had
a drunken kiss and I kinda liked it.

12:26.112 --> 12:27.279
Anyway, boys...

12:27.346 --> 12:29.048
(laughter)
On that note...

12:29.115 --> 12:33.052
I've known Gary for a long, long
time and I can always, always tell

12:33.119 --> 12:35.321
when he's being
a shifty little bastard.

12:35.387 --> 12:37.723
Gary, what are you up to?

12:45.431 --> 12:47.066
Ow!
(laughter)

12:47.133 --> 12:50.302
The day has been belter and
I'm looking forward to tonight.

12:50.369 --> 12:53.506
But it feels weird
keeping my kiss with Gary a secret.

12:53.572 --> 12:55.207
You should neck on with Scott.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.976
I've been there and done that.

12:57.042 --> 13:00.012
Like, it really does not
appeal to me whatsoever.

13:00.079 --> 13:05.084
What is the point of Holly getting
"triple Fs" if she's so frigid?

13:05.151 --> 13:07.820
What's wrong with the girl?
At least get fingered.

13:07.887 --> 13:09.855
You have a boyfriend.

13:09.922 --> 13:12.925
Yeah, but, Marns,
he doesn't know about your secret.

13:12.992 --> 13:15.661
He's always known
that I've liked girls, but...

13:15.728 --> 13:20.766
Like, he's never actually heard us
say, "I like girls" in that way.

13:20.833 --> 13:24.303
I feel a bit anxious about Aaron
finding out about my sexuality.

13:24.370 --> 13:27.706
I've waited a long time for this
and I don't want it ruined.

13:27.773 --> 13:29.875
Come on, bitches!

13:31.610 --> 13:33.646
Tonight, we're going in.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.853
We get to the club and it's not
just bouncing, it's glowing.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.922
I think I'm gonna get a tan.

13:46.592 --> 13:49.228
Tonight's the celebration
for Marnie and Aaron.

13:49.295 --> 13:51.263
It may have only taken him
a few years,

13:51.330 --> 13:53.232
but they've finally
put a label on it.

13:55.267 --> 13:57.636
(cheering)

13:57.703 --> 14:01.106
Tonight is all about us.
I don't want nowt to ruin it.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.620
I'm not experienced
in relationships.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.923
But I want Marnie to know
that I only want her kissing me.

14:30.202 --> 14:33.405
Hold on a minute, Aaron. We've
only been together a few hours

14:33.472 --> 14:37.176
and you're dishing out commands.
I asked for a boyfriend, not a pimp.

14:38.143 --> 14:41.680
I've been keeping my lips sealed
about this kiss with Chantelle,

14:41.747 --> 14:44.650
but I'm shit at keeping secrets.
I'm gonna tell Aaron.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.452
He's the only person I can trust.

14:53.792 --> 14:55.961
For fuck's sake, Gary. Spit it out.

15:01.367 --> 15:02.368
(laughs)

15:02.434 --> 15:05.504
Gary and Chantelle are single.
They can do what they want.

15:05.571 --> 15:09.008
I'm not bothered. Holly, on the
other hand, will fucking kick off,

15:09.074 --> 15:11.343
cos Charlotte is Holly's best mate.

15:19.184 --> 15:22.688
(Nathan) I'm watching Gary
and Chantelle. What is going on?

15:22.755 --> 15:25.124
I didn't even know
they liked each other.

15:29.962 --> 15:33.866
I love hanging out with Holly, but
I can tell she's missing Charlotte.

15:36.769 --> 15:40.306
Charlotte is my best friend
and when she's in a better place,

15:40.372 --> 15:43.809
she'll come back to the family
and we'll make more memories.

15:58.991 --> 16:01.327
Chloe went radge
for no reason last night.

16:01.393 --> 16:04.096
I'm not gonna talk to her
until she's apologised.

16:04.163 --> 16:05.464
I'm standing me ground.

16:08.133 --> 16:11.804
Me and Marty haven't spoken all day
and I really need to apologise.

16:11.870 --> 16:14.139
I'm embarrassed
about throwing nuggets

16:14.206 --> 16:16.308
and kicking off
for something stupid.

16:18.110 --> 16:21.347
She best be ready to apologise
or I'm gonna go fucking radge.

16:25.551 --> 16:27.319
(cheers)

16:34.827 --> 16:38.097
So far on this trip I've been
nothing but honest with Chloe.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.133
She keeps throwing it back
in my face. I've had enough.

16:45.070 --> 16:47.339
I go radge because I'm insecure.

16:47.406 --> 16:50.576
I'm trying to stop myself
from getting hurt like in the past.

16:52.711 --> 16:56.482
I wanna make you happy, Marty, but
I can't promise to take things slow.

16:56.548 --> 16:58.684
In fact, I'd rather mish one

16:58.751 --> 17:02.454
and Usain Bolt back to the villa
and give you a medal of my own.

17:05.758 --> 17:06.959
We've had a good night,

17:07.025 --> 17:10.396
but it's time to leave the club
and head home to get some scran.

17:22.273 --> 17:25.277
We get back to the villa
and I am mortal-stinking-drunk.

17:25.344 --> 17:27.713
I can't even walk straight.
I'm going to bed.

17:29.348 --> 17:30.783
We picked up a takeaway

17:30.849 --> 17:33.886
and I cannot wait
to munch on my chicken nuggets.

17:33.952 --> 17:35.721
Where's the chicken nuggets?

17:36.922 --> 17:39.491
Surprise(!)
Chloe has got her tits out again.

17:40.793 --> 17:43.829
No. Who ate my fucking
chicken nuggets? I swear to God.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.398
I've got no idea
where your chicken nuggets are,

17:46.465 --> 17:48.967
but you should try this pizza.
It's delicious.

17:49.034 --> 17:51.603
(laughter)

17:51.670 --> 17:53.605
I fucking hate pizza, me.

17:54.606 --> 17:56.408
Give us a kiss. Give us a kiss.

17:56.475 --> 17:59.745
One of the benefits of being
in a relationship is sex on tap.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.046
I'm buzzing, me.

18:01.113 --> 18:02.881
Goodnight, motherfuckers!

18:07.386 --> 18:11.123
It's late and I'm knackered. I'm
enjoying hanging out with Nathan,

18:11.190 --> 18:13.025
so I'll go to bed in the lads' room.

18:16.028 --> 18:19.565
Once again, I found myself sitting
there in front of Chantelle.

18:19.631 --> 18:22.267
Do you know what it is?
There's nobody here.

18:24.369 --> 18:26.171
A harmless few kisses? Fuck it.

18:28.474 --> 18:30.042
Me and Gary are on the settee,

18:30.108 --> 18:32.644
and next thing you know,
I'm back there again.

18:32.711 --> 18:35.347
This cannot keep happening.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.293
This is what being
in a relationship is about.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.162
Quality sex all the time.

19:01.273 --> 19:03.909
No, Aaron, I'm being serious.
I'm done.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.244
Finish yourself off.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.411
(giggles)

19:08.247 --> 19:11.450
If this is the type of sex
that's gonna be on tap from now on,

19:11.517 --> 19:12.518
I'm fucked.

19:16.388 --> 19:20.092
Ibiza!
Ibiza, here we come!

19:20.158 --> 19:23.161
She's got her tongue
halfway down her throat.

19:23.228 --> 19:25.931
Marty is fucked off.
We're not friends any more.

19:28.066 --> 19:30.068
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

19:32.471 --> 19:32.671
.

19:35.207 --> 19:35.407
.

19:35.474 --> 19:37.776
(Marty)
Warning - Geodie Shore's full-on!

19:37.843 --> 19:41.313
So do not watch if you can't handle
the bad language and sex scenes.

20:06.805 --> 20:08.540
I know. I'm happy for yous.

20:08.607 --> 20:12.644
You know how I love chicken nuggets?
Like, I love Marty the same.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.646
Oh, shit, that's a big 'un!
I know.

20:14.713 --> 20:17.149
Chicken nuggets and Marty
are very similar.

20:17.215 --> 20:19.851
Chicken nuggets taste so good
and so does Marty.

20:19.918 --> 20:20.919
Once he's washed.

20:25.123 --> 20:28.060
Oh, God, I actually
don't feel that hung over today.

20:28.126 --> 20:30.062
Do you remember having sex?
Yeah.

20:30.128 --> 20:33.765
I bet you do, Marnie. You had
your orgasm and fucking rolled over.

20:33.832 --> 20:35.801
I feel fucking used.

20:35.867 --> 20:38.337
Listen, you know
on the boat yesterday?

20:38.403 --> 20:41.773
Everyone was downstairs,
Gary and Chantelle were upstairs

20:41.840 --> 20:45.611
Mm-hmm. And Gary told us last night
that they started necking on.

20:45.677 --> 20:46.745
(laughs)

20:46.812 --> 20:49.848
I can't believe that, Aaron.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.483
What the hell will Holly do?

20:51.550 --> 20:55.087
Gary getting with Chantelle
is gonna hurt Holly and Charlotte.

20:55.153 --> 20:56.788
Shit is gonna hit the fan.

20:56.855 --> 21:00.292
This is literally
gonna start World War II.

21:00.359 --> 21:02.160
(laughs)

21:02.227 --> 21:05.564
Fucking hell, Marns,
what primary school did you go to?

21:09.167 --> 21:10.902
How you feeling this morning?

21:10.969 --> 21:13.972
Bit hung over. That was
one of the best nights I've had.

21:14.039 --> 21:17.342
Everyone was just getting along.
There was no arguments.

21:17.409 --> 21:19.144
Last night was fucking wicked,

21:19.211 --> 21:21.747
but I told Chloe
that we need to take things slow

21:21.813 --> 21:23.615
till I figure out what it is I want.

21:23.682 --> 21:26.084
Morning, guys.
Morning.

21:26.151 --> 21:28.520
The happy couple
are out of the shag pad,

21:28.587 --> 21:31.490
and Marnie is bouncing like Tigger.
I am happy for her.

21:31.556 --> 21:33.659
It's like the morning
after a wedding.

21:33.725 --> 21:35.360
I had a lethal time on that boat.

21:35.427 --> 21:37.029
It was good, wasn't it?

21:37.095 --> 21:40.799
Since I've broke up with Kyle,
these lot think I've been miserable.

21:40.866 --> 21:43.468
But I wanna prove
that happy Holly is back.

21:43.535 --> 21:47.239
I can be fun and spontaneous.
So, I've planned a secret surprise.

21:47.305 --> 21:51.543
Listen, everyone, I've organised us
a trip to an amazing place.

21:51.610 --> 21:54.379
Kebab shop? Disneyland? Bingo?

21:54.446 --> 21:56.381
Ibiza!

21:56.448 --> 21:57.749
(cheering)

21:58.984 --> 22:01.853
This is the best idea
Holly has ever came up with.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.656
Fuck off!
(laughter)

22:04.723 --> 22:05.891
Holly's idea of fun

22:05.957 --> 22:09.294
is having three ice cubes
in her drink instead of two.

22:09.361 --> 22:13.765
But Ibiza? Holly, that's the best
thing I've ever heard you say.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.301
(Chloe) Right, I'm gonna go pack.

22:16.368 --> 22:18.737
What are we waiting for?
Let's book taxis.

22:18.804 --> 22:22.240
Let's get to the airport.
Ibiza, here we come!

22:22.307 --> 22:25.544
We're going to Ibiza!
Ibiza!

22:25.610 --> 22:28.780
I have no doubt that we are
gonna have an amazing few days.

22:28.847 --> 22:32.150
I just hope everyone's as excited
about the accommodation.

22:36.154 --> 22:38.657
Yeah, man. Fuck it! Boss nuts!

22:38.724 --> 22:42.694
Anna, you can fuck off.
We're going to Ibiza. See you later.

22:43.995 --> 22:47.099
Somebody tell Marty
about Ibiza and the dress code,

22:47.165 --> 22:50.769
because by the looks of it, he
thinks we're going on a school trip.

22:50.836 --> 22:53.605
I bet you he's got
a packed lunch in there as well.

22:56.608 --> 22:58.009
Yay!

22:58.076 --> 23:02.314
I am fucking buzzing. Get me on that
plane. I'm gonna dance my dick off.

23:12.924 --> 23:16.628
This is going to be mint.
I know Holly will not let us down.

23:16.695 --> 23:18.230
It's gonna be shwicked.

23:20.932 --> 23:23.201
There's a big massive villa
over there.

23:23.268 --> 23:25.003
Speed boat us to that, man.

23:25.070 --> 23:28.507
Me and the lads reckon Holly's
sorted a pure wicked villa.

23:28.573 --> 23:29.608
W-W-W-Wicked!

23:29.674 --> 23:32.744
Fuck. Are we turning right here?

23:32.811 --> 23:33.979
Wow.

23:34.045 --> 23:36.148
Holly, howay, a campsite?

23:36.214 --> 23:39.785
I know I've got an activity badge
in tying girls in knots,

23:39.851 --> 23:41.386
but do I look like a Beaver?

23:47.626 --> 23:49.327
It's a fucking pink caravan.

23:49.394 --> 23:51.930
What the fuck is this shithole?

23:51.997 --> 23:55.267
There is no way you whinging fuckers
are gonna bring me down.

23:55.333 --> 23:59.638
I have made a last-minute trip
to Ibiza happen. I'm gonna enjoy it.

23:59.704 --> 24:04.409
Just embrace it.
Stop being so miserable.

24:04.476 --> 24:07.012
Holly's right.
We're in Ibiza, for fuck's sake.

24:07.078 --> 24:09.848
So let's get ourselves done up,
looking on fleek,

24:09.915 --> 24:11.583
and smash the strip.

24:13.752 --> 24:15.587
I think tonight's gonna be good.

24:15.654 --> 24:18.723
I'm glad everybody's getting
their head around the camp,

24:18.790 --> 24:21.159
so now we can concentrate
on getting ready.

24:21.226 --> 24:25.197
Marnie, I feel like this is your
first holiday away with Aaron.

24:25.263 --> 24:27.199
Like, it just... It's different

24:27.265 --> 24:31.169
and I'm excited to see
how things go tonight and stuff.

24:31.236 --> 24:34.639
Me and Aaron are in such a good
place. Tonight's gonna be good.

24:36.441 --> 24:39.010
This looked like a bad thing
to start off with.

24:39.077 --> 24:41.847
I think it's cool as fuck.
(Gaz) I do. Really cool.

24:41.913 --> 24:44.149
Well done, Holly.
You've done a great job.

24:44.216 --> 24:47.185
This hippy camp, or whatever it is,
is growing on us.

24:47.252 --> 24:49.788
It's the first time
I've seen her in a good mood.

24:49.855 --> 24:51.256
(laughs)

24:51.323 --> 24:54.292
But it's good to see she's happy.
Course it is.

24:54.359 --> 24:55.961
Since Holly and Kyle broke up,

24:56.027 --> 24:58.697
she's gained a reputation
as a miserable bitch.

24:58.763 --> 25:00.999
This idea has given her
a confidence boost

25:01.066 --> 25:03.268
and she seems to be
in a really good place.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.669
Come on, everyone!

25:04.736 --> 25:06.338
It's our first night in Ibiza,

25:06.404 --> 25:09.107
everyone is buzzing
and tonight is gonna be mint.

25:09.174 --> 25:13.078
At the end of the day, it isn't
work, so let's go and party.

25:14.446 --> 25:18.516
I pure love Ibiza, me.
Tonight, I'm gonna go radge.

25:18.583 --> 25:22.420
I'm gonna be Scotty super-charged,
double-rampaged techno T,

25:22.487 --> 25:24.389
turbo-fucking Timlin. Oi, oi!

25:29.594 --> 25:33.531
We get to the club, the place is
bouncing. Tonight is gonna be wicked.

25:45.543 --> 25:48.179
It's been playing on my mind
about me and Gary.

25:48.246 --> 25:51.216
I just wanna get it off my chest.
So, I tell Marnie.

25:59.691 --> 26:02.327
The best actress award
goes to Marnie Simpson

26:02.394 --> 26:06.131
for her role in pretending to hear
some news she'd already heard.

26:06.197 --> 26:07.632
Thank you very much.

26:28.119 --> 26:30.422
Since we got here,
Marty's ignored us.

26:30.488 --> 26:33.291
There's taking things slowly
and taking the piss.

26:41.199 --> 26:43.501
You know what?
I have always had this side.

26:43.568 --> 26:45.403
I just need to bring it out more.

26:49.474 --> 26:51.009
I know Marty says he likes us,

26:51.076 --> 26:54.145
but at the moment he's acting
like he doesn't want us.

26:54.212 --> 26:57.882
I know what will get his attention.
Necking on with random boys.

26:59.084 --> 27:00.852
Chloe was saying she likes us,

27:00.919 --> 27:04.289
then she went straight into
the crowd and necked on with a lad.

27:04.356 --> 27:05.357
Well, aye.

27:17.268 --> 27:21.773
Fuck. My tactics didn't work. I think
I might have fucked things up.

27:33.585 --> 27:35.620
By Chloe getting with a lad tonight,

27:35.687 --> 27:38.490
that has just allowed me
to go on the fucking razzle.

27:41.693 --> 27:43.461
Marty isn't gonna speak to us.

27:43.528 --> 27:45.764
I'm gonna get mortal
and party instead.

27:53.671 --> 27:57.175
I am mortal-drunk and so is Chloe.
I can't help it.

27:57.242 --> 28:00.245
I just like to kiss her
and dance like idiots.

28:02.080 --> 28:05.617
You've got to be kidding me. I told
Marnie not to kiss Chloe any more.

28:05.683 --> 28:09.087
She's got her tongue halfway down
her throat. What a liberty.

28:16.694 --> 28:19.130
Aaron looks like his head
is about to explode.

28:19.197 --> 28:21.800
We need to get out of here
before shit hits the fan.

28:32.477 --> 28:36.047
That music in there...
that was a different level.

28:36.114 --> 28:38.016
Compare that to Magaluf.

28:38.083 --> 28:42.420
I'm mortal-drunk in the taxi and
I reveal my secret to the others.

28:42.487 --> 28:46.124
Compare that to mine
and Gary's kiss.

28:46.191 --> 28:47.625
You haven't kissed.

28:47.692 --> 28:49.027
When did yous kiss?

28:49.094 --> 28:50.695
No, yous didn't.

28:50.762 --> 28:52.697
You what? Gary's kissed Chantelle?

28:52.764 --> 28:56.000
Why would he do that? Surely he
knows it would piss people off.

28:56.067 --> 28:57.535
Especially Holly.

28:57.602 --> 29:02.607
Chantelle, for me, same for you,
you're single, I'm single.

29:02.674 --> 29:05.009
Wh... Why can't...
Why can't we neck on?

29:05.076 --> 29:09.013
Chantelle's pissed and she just
put me on the spot about our kiss.

29:09.080 --> 29:12.283
It's only a matter of time
before Holly finds out.

29:20.758 --> 29:24.462
Get back to the caravans and I'm
fuming with Marnie for kissing Chloe,

29:24.529 --> 29:26.965
but I'll ignore it
and deal with it tomorrow.

29:27.031 --> 29:28.600
Right, I'm gonna go for a wee.

29:28.666 --> 29:30.768
Ibiza has been fucking amazing.

29:30.835 --> 29:33.705
I've loved it.
I've had a good time with the girls,

29:33.771 --> 29:36.374
a good, old dance with Chloe.
It's time for bed.

29:42.914 --> 29:46.084
So far on this trip, I've been
nothing but honest with Chloe.

29:46.151 --> 29:49.087
She's just thrown it back
in my face. I've had enough.

29:49.154 --> 29:53.324
Your lack of respect has just proven
how much I didn't even know you

29:53.391 --> 29:54.826
in the first place at all.

29:54.893 --> 29:57.862
Just go to sleep.
I'm going to sleep.

29:57.929 --> 30:02.467
We're ju... We're not friends
any more. W-We're not friends?

30:02.534 --> 30:04.969
Did you just say we're not friends?
We're not.

30:05.036 --> 30:07.205
Shit! Marty is really fucked off.

30:07.272 --> 30:10.508
And now he's talking about
not even being friends any more.

30:12.277 --> 30:14.145
I need to fix this situation.

30:14.212 --> 30:17.348
I need to get in that caravan
and give him a kiss. Or a cuddle.

30:17.415 --> 30:20.552
Or a blowie. From Chloe.
That will make the situation right.

30:23.188 --> 30:27.458
Please, go out of here.
I don't understand.

30:27.525 --> 30:29.827
This is a joke.

30:31.996 --> 30:34.065
What the fuck
is wrong with this girl?

30:34.132 --> 30:36.601
Just give me some space
and stop being a weirdo.

30:36.668 --> 30:39.204
Can I get away from you?

30:39.270 --> 30:42.941
The fact that Marty was prepared
to climb out a window to get away

30:43.007 --> 30:45.043
suggests that
it's time to go to bed.

30:58.156 --> 31:01.025
I'll be here for Chloe.
She's one of my best friends.

31:01.092 --> 31:04.529
But The smart thing for her to do now
is go to bed and sleep on it.

31:04.596 --> 31:07.131
Everything will be different
in the morning.

31:23.681 --> 31:26.384
Oh, my God!
Marty's actually pulled a girl.

31:26.451 --> 31:28.353
(screams)

31:31.689 --> 31:34.459
Charlotte's bed's not even
fucking cold yet.

31:34.525 --> 31:36.527
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

31:38.963 --> 31:39.163
.

31:41.666 --> 31:41.899
.

31:41.966 --> 31:44.269
(Nathan)
Alreet? Geordie Shore contains

31:44.335 --> 31:46.371
loads of bad language and sex scenes.

31:46.437 --> 31:47.705
So, it's dead simple.

31:47.772 --> 31:50.108
If you're easily offended,
don't watch.

31:56.214 --> 31:58.683
(Marnie)
I necked on with Chloe again.

32:00.652 --> 32:03.655
You have to take it on the chin.
It's never gonna stop.

32:03.721 --> 32:06.524
Marnie's making a joke about it,
but I'm not happy.

32:06.591 --> 32:09.694
In a relationship, you don't
kiss other people. End of.

32:10.695 --> 32:13.998
What happened last night, Nathan?
I'm dreading knowing.

32:14.065 --> 32:17.602
Once again, you keep kicking off
when he hasn't done anything.

32:17.669 --> 32:20.338
Last night it was you
that went and kissed a boy.

32:20.405 --> 32:21.706
As much as I love Chloe,

32:21.773 --> 32:24.409
she's not doing herself
any favours with Marty.

32:24.475 --> 32:26.377
She might have pushed him too far.

32:26.444 --> 32:29.580
I think I'm gonna have to
just speak to him when I'm sober,

32:29.647 --> 32:32.283
and just tell him we need to talk,

32:32.350 --> 32:34.485
and we need to
tell the complete truth.

32:34.552 --> 32:38.189
I'm sick of booting off, but
I only do it cos I'm so insecure.

32:38.256 --> 32:41.292
I don't believe he likes us,
but I do wanna speak to him.

32:47.465 --> 32:51.135
Last night, Chloe necked on with
a lad and then kicked off at me.

32:51.202 --> 32:55.106
It's got to the point where I'm
jumping out of windows to get away.

32:55.173 --> 32:56.307
She needs help.

32:57.308 --> 33:00.044
Good morning, campers.

33:00.111 --> 33:03.414
I've woken up with Holly.
It's probably the last time.

33:03.481 --> 33:06.851
When she finds out about me
and Gary, she's gonna kick off.

33:06.918 --> 33:10.021
We're going to the beach.
Get your ass up!

33:10.088 --> 33:12.890
I'm fucking frying,
sitting in these caravans.

33:12.957 --> 33:16.594
So I'll get the squad together and
take my pipe for a fucking paddle.

33:21.766 --> 33:25.336
I need to talk to Marnie
because last night, she kissed Chloe.

33:25.403 --> 33:27.772
We're gonna go on a pedalo,
have a nice chat,

33:27.839 --> 33:29.841
and, hopefully, she can't run off.

33:29.907 --> 33:33.678
I don't know whether we're coming
or going, know what I mean? Yeah.

33:33.745 --> 33:36.781
I'm actually relieved
that I'm gonna get a bit of time,

33:36.848 --> 33:39.884
just me and Aaron, to talk
privately. It's what we need.

33:39.951 --> 33:43.488
(exhales heavily) Like, you
kiss Chloe more than you kiss me.

33:43.554 --> 33:47.925
Right. I can't believe we're gonna
go into this. You're like that.

33:47.992 --> 33:51.129
You'd rather spend the night
with Gary. No, Marnie.

33:51.195 --> 33:54.065
Shock. When she's in the wrong,
she can't handle it.

33:54.132 --> 33:56.768
All the lads go,
"She kisses Chloe more than you."

33:56.834 --> 33:58.803
Do you know how embarrassing that is?

33:58.870 --> 34:02.140
Chloe gives us more attention
than what you do.

34:02.206 --> 34:05.009
Aaron's right.
I shouldn't be kissing Chloe.

34:05.076 --> 34:09.179
I fucking hate that he's right,
and I just don't wanna deal with it.

34:09.246 --> 34:13.050
Oh, wow. Once again,
runs away from the situation.

34:14.552 --> 34:17.021
She deserves an award
for that performance.

34:17.088 --> 34:20.291
I love Marnie, but I've got no idea
what goes on in her head.

34:29.367 --> 34:31.835
(insect buzzes, Chloe screams)
Fuck!

34:32.770 --> 34:34.038
It's gone. It's gone.

34:35.106 --> 34:36.607
Right, I'm gonna speak.

34:36.674 --> 34:39.543
I'm sat with Chloe and for once,
I'm gonna speak first.

34:39.610 --> 34:41.344
She's gonna listen to the truth.

34:41.411 --> 34:44.882
Every single night you've given us
a different excuse to hate you.

34:44.949 --> 34:46.484
I feel like I don't know you,

34:46.551 --> 34:49.719
and you're meant to be my best mate,
someone that I fancy.

34:49.786 --> 34:53.658
You say I don't like you, but I've
given you no reason to think that.

34:53.724 --> 34:56.293
There's big trust issues between us.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.663
And all I wanna go back to
is how we were.

34:58.729 --> 35:00.531
But I think I've fucked things up.

35:00.598 --> 35:03.334
I wanna apologise,
cos I've kicked off every night.

35:03.401 --> 35:05.703
That's because I'm scared
of getting hurt.

35:05.770 --> 35:10.007
So, instead, when you fuck things
up, why do you get with someone?

35:10.074 --> 35:12.610
I don't know.
I didn't believe you liked us.

35:12.677 --> 35:14.779
I just thought it was all a game.

35:14.846 --> 35:17.448
That's the weirdest thing
I've heard in my life.

35:17.515 --> 35:20.885
This is it. Like, we're not even
gonna be friends, I don't think.

35:20.952 --> 35:23.120
I think that's a bit too far.
It's not.

35:23.187 --> 35:25.857
You're pissing us off every night
and I'm bored.

35:25.923 --> 35:28.659
Chloe Day and Chloe Night
are two different people.

35:28.726 --> 35:31.062
I can't be arsed with
night-time version.

35:31.128 --> 35:33.264
I'm gonna do my own thing
and crack on.

35:37.201 --> 35:39.537
(Gaz)
The beach was what everyone needed.

35:39.604 --> 35:42.039
Now we need to get ready
for night two in Ibiza.

35:43.040 --> 35:45.376
(screaming, laughter)

35:45.443 --> 35:48.179
I'm getting ready
with the girls and I'm buzzing.

35:48.246 --> 35:51.649
Tonight, let's go fucking radge!

35:52.850 --> 35:55.720
One, two, three!
(all cheer)

35:55.786 --> 36:00.358
We look mint and we smell even
better. Tonight is gonna be wicked.

36:03.361 --> 36:07.164
We're on our way to the club and
there's a massive beacon of light.

36:07.231 --> 36:09.400
It's got our name
written all over it.

36:11.402 --> 36:14.038
I'm not gonna lie,
this sling shot is massive.

36:14.105 --> 36:17.508
But I'm not gonna bottle out.
I'm gonna show Marnie who's boss.

36:17.575 --> 36:21.245
It's been a good life!
(screaming) Marnie!

36:21.312 --> 36:23.147
Oh, my God!
(laughter)

36:24.282 --> 36:26.117
I'm so proud of you, Nathan.

36:26.183 --> 36:29.453
If the boys can do this
and the girls can do this,

36:29.520 --> 36:32.823
I've gotta do it. I don't want to be
the pussy of the group.

36:32.890 --> 36:37.495
(screaming)

36:37.562 --> 36:40.164
Oh, my God! Fucking hell!

36:40.231 --> 36:43.401
I know people wouldn't expect me
to like things like this,

36:43.467 --> 36:45.636
but I fucking love it.
(screaming)

36:45.703 --> 36:48.639
Is it weird
that it's giving us a stiffy?

36:48.706 --> 36:50.007
Nearly blew my dick off.

36:51.275 --> 36:54.679
My hair's still OK, I haven't shit
myself, I haven't been sick.

36:54.745 --> 36:57.114
I'm full of adrenaline.
Get me to a club.

37:00.351 --> 37:03.321
(Aaron) Get to Plastic,
this is what I'm talking about.

37:03.387 --> 37:06.924
Amazing club, tunes are banging.
Let's get fucking smashed.

37:09.627 --> 37:11.829
(cheering)

37:12.863 --> 37:15.866
I had a snog with Chantelle,
but it's not going anywhere.

37:15.933 --> 37:18.636
The sooner I get back on the pull,
the better.

37:20.838 --> 37:23.374
So, I've spotted
these two lethal birds in here.

37:23.441 --> 37:27.845
I'm always on the pull. Yeah, man,
I'm on the pull 365 days a year.

37:27.912 --> 37:30.214
Even Christmas Day,
I'm pulling crackers.

37:30.281 --> 37:34.018
With Scott by my side,
pulling two wicked blonde birds,

37:34.085 --> 37:37.121
I feel so happy. I'm back.

37:37.188 --> 37:40.958
(Chantelle) I'm not arsed that
Gary's necking on with that bird.

37:41.025 --> 37:44.428
But if he thinks he's coming back
to me afterward, he can fuck off.

37:53.638 --> 37:56.707
Most of us know Chantelle and Gaz
kissed at the boat party.

37:56.774 --> 37:59.910
Holly deserves to know.
I think it's best it comes from me.

38:08.686 --> 38:11.455
How the fuck could Gary do that
with somebody else?

38:11.522 --> 38:13.691
Charlotte's bed's not even cold yet.

38:16.994 --> 38:20.865
Please, not now.
I don't really wanna lose my bird.

38:27.972 --> 38:32.176
I was holding on to this grain of
hope that Charlotte might come back.

38:32.243 --> 38:35.880
He's chucked that grain, pissed on
it, stamped on it, set it on fire,

38:35.946 --> 38:39.350
and when she finds out, she'll
never set foot in the door again.

38:55.366 --> 38:58.602
Holly's putting all this on me
and sometimes it's not fair.

38:58.669 --> 39:01.338
Charlotte's moved on.
I'm trying to do the same.

39:01.405 --> 39:03.841
Sometimes, Holly,
just keep your nose out.

39:12.550 --> 39:14.852
I'm not really angry with Chantelle.

39:14.919 --> 39:18.823
She could have shown more respect,
but it's Gary I'm angry with.

39:18.889 --> 39:21.225
He shouldn't be rubbing salt
in the wounds.

39:25.229 --> 39:29.467
Gaz and Scott have got two birds,
so I'm on a one-man patrol.

39:29.533 --> 39:33.304
I seen that bird on the dancefloor
giving us the eye, so why not?

39:37.041 --> 39:38.509
Marty's pulled a girl.

39:38.576 --> 39:43.514
I won't lie, it's gonna kill us. I
need to get my anger out. (screams)

39:46.117 --> 39:49.320
Marty, the prick,
has decided to pull a girl

39:49.386 --> 39:52.757
and break Chloe's heart
into a thousand pieces.

39:52.823 --> 39:54.492
And I am not standing for that.

39:54.558 --> 39:57.061
Be a man and take control.
Get the fuck away!

39:57.128 --> 39:59.864
Aaron needs to get his bird
fucking away from me,

39:59.930 --> 40:01.298
cos she's pissing me off.

40:01.365 --> 40:04.301
Marnie goes over to Marty
and I'm not fucking having it.

40:04.368 --> 40:06.904
There's no way
you're ruining Marty's night.

40:13.844 --> 40:17.248
We can't go on as a couple if he's
not gonna start putting me first.

40:17.314 --> 40:19.049
I should be priority, not Marty.

40:19.116 --> 40:20.818
Aaron, stop it now.

40:20.885 --> 40:23.721
Aaron has interrupted
Marnie's cock block on Marty.

40:23.788 --> 40:27.057
It's best I take over
and make sure this little radgie

40:27.124 --> 40:29.727
doesn't take this lass home
for Chloe's sake.

40:35.866 --> 40:38.002
I've had a wicked time
with this bird,

40:38.068 --> 40:40.771
but seeing Chloe that upset
does bother us a bit,

40:40.838 --> 40:42.473
so I cannot take her back.

40:47.244 --> 40:49.046
Tonight has gone fucking shite.

40:49.113 --> 40:52.149
Someone needs to get me home
before I lose it.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.052
It's time to bounce out of the club

40:55.119 --> 40:57.855
and take these two birds
back to the campsite.

40:59.390 --> 41:02.760
What a night. The lads have pulled,
the girls are kicking off,

41:02.827 --> 41:05.095
and me and Marnie
are arguing once again.

41:07.164 --> 41:09.166
You're girlfriend material?
I am.

41:09.233 --> 41:11.502
Unless he says sorry,
he can fuck off.

41:11.569 --> 41:14.104
Buy a fucking book
on how to be a good boyfriend.

41:14.171 --> 41:16.273
Nah. I'm good. I'm good.

41:20.144 --> 41:24.014
I'm absolutely mortal, I'm foaming.
The best place for me is bed.

41:27.685 --> 41:31.989
Tonight, Holly's staying with me
and I need to go through the rules.

41:32.056 --> 41:35.759
If your skin touches me, you're out.
Never.

41:35.826 --> 41:39.196
If your toes touch me... Never.
...we never speak.

41:39.263 --> 41:41.899
I hate the fact
that Charlotte's not on this trip,

41:41.966 --> 41:45.769
but I respect her decision. I'm glad
I've got Nathan. I'm going to bed.

41:47.304 --> 41:49.573
I tried to give Marnie
my full attention,

41:49.640 --> 41:51.909
but she was too busy
cock-blocking Marty.

41:51.976 --> 41:55.412
Now she's says I'm a shit boyfriend.
Fuck this. I'm off to bed.

41:57.915 --> 42:00.684
Aaron spat his dummy out
and went to bed on his own,

42:00.751 --> 42:03.721
so I'm just gonna
crash with Chantelle.

42:06.323 --> 42:10.127
We get back, Scott gets into his
caravan, I've got my caravan.

42:10.194 --> 42:13.130
This girl doesn't realise
I haven't pulled for a while.

42:13.197 --> 42:14.665
She's in for a treat.

42:14.732 --> 42:18.602
(moaning, panting)

42:18.669 --> 42:21.372
I'm desperate to buck
the arse off this bird.

42:21.438 --> 42:24.975
I'm a bit anxious all three of us
aren't gonna fit at the same time.

42:25.042 --> 42:27.278
Me and my dick
are already tight for space.

42:27.344 --> 42:28.812
(moaning)

42:32.216 --> 42:34.618
(Marty) Tonight has been a disaster.

42:34.685 --> 42:37.288
Gaz and Scott are in their caravans
banging away,

42:37.354 --> 42:39.156
and I'm in my caravan by myself.

42:44.695 --> 42:46.130
I divn't know what to do.

42:46.196 --> 42:49.366
I cannot be with Chloe cos she
doesn't believe that I like her

42:49.433 --> 42:51.869
and I cannot be single
cos she's pure jealous.

42:51.936 --> 42:53.270
(sniffles)

42:55.172 --> 42:56.674
I'm fucked, me, like.

43:00.678 --> 43:03.380
Let's go get fucking mortal.
(clattering)

43:03.447 --> 43:07.217
It's not how you treat a girl.
It's starting to piss us off.

43:07.284 --> 43:08.786
What the actual fuck?

43:08.852 --> 43:12.222
(farts) Welcome to the girls' room,
you little radge packet!

43:12.289 --> 43:13.524
(retches, coughs)

43:13.590 --> 43:14.892
I don't feel too good.

43:14.959 --> 43:19.263
It's our last night in Magaluf
and I wanna go out with a bang.

43:19.330 --> 43:21.732
I've never felt so low
than what I feel now.

43:21.799 --> 43:23.167
I'm done. I'm done.

43:23.233 --> 43:24.535
I can't believe this.

43:24.601 --> 43:27.438
The way I'm feeling,
I don't see us ever coming back.

43:52.429 --> 43:52.629
.
