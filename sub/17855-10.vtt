- [gasps]

00:14.315 --> 00:15.716
I timed it perfectly.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.551
We arrived
at the exact same time.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.320
- Good morning, Penny.
- Good morning.

00:19.353 --> 00:20.554
- I think it's gonna be
a good day.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.356
- You look radiant.
- Oh.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.359
- Oh, my God, Wendy Williams
is gonna love your shoes.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.228
What time is the interview?
- I don't know.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.696
I have to look it up
when we get upstairs.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.264
- Okay.

00:30.298 --> 00:31.532
- I'm just kidding.
It's at 2:00.

00:31.565 --> 00:32.733
Ah, my stomach's
been in knots.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.568
I have been pooping
all night.

00:34.602 --> 00:35.736
- [chuckles]

00:35.769 --> 00:37.238
So, um, I know
that you didn't want

00:37.271 --> 00:39.140
anyone to know
that it's your birthday.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.608
- Oh, Penny, please,
I don't want

00:40.641 --> 00:43.077
some big office party
with awkward cake cutting,

00:43.111 --> 00:45.213
and I can't stand
the faces of everybody

00:45.246 --> 00:47.715
who can't afford to buy me
an expensive gift.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.150
- Well...

00:49.183 --> 00:51.085
I made this for you.

00:51.119 --> 00:52.253
- Ohh.

00:52.286 --> 00:53.554
- Make a wish.

00:53.587 --> 00:54.855
- All right.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.290
Should I close my eyes?

00:56.324 --> 00:58.159
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.260

01:41.502 --> 01:43.804
I like to be active
in my borough.

01:43.837 --> 01:44.905

01:47.575 --> 01:49.243
- Got to stop you
right there.

01:49.277 --> 01:51.345
Those shoes, not even close
to pulling them off.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.646
- Okay, Marcus,
you're not the only person

01:52.680 --> 01:54.282
that gets to dabble in fashion.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.883
- And genders.
- Watch it, ginger.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.485

Guy the Snake Guy
with a 40-foot anaconda,

02:06.494 --> 02:07.895
and last, somehow Todd

02:07.928 --> 02:10.164
got Rosie Perez
to do a "Todd the Tool" sketch.

02:10.198 --> 02:11.699
So whoo!

02:11.732 --> 02:13.334
- I can't wait to see
what tool I get to play.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.702
I'm really hoping for a hammer.

02:14.735 --> 02:17.338
- Pretty great that we
landed Mariska, huh?

02:17.371 --> 02:19.340
- Big "SVU" fan, are we?

02:19.373 --> 02:20.574
- Yeah.
I mean, who isn't?

02:20.608 --> 02:21.942
It's on all day.
She's great.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.911
And the show's great.
It's a win-win.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.213
- Do you think she's pretty?

02:25.246 --> 02:26.380
- Yeah, she's pretty.

02:26.414 --> 02:27.481
- Really pretty?

02:27.515 --> 02:28.849
- Yes, she's really pretty.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.585
- Would you consider yourself
a stalker?

02:31.619 --> 02:32.920
- What?

02:32.953 --> 02:34.755
- Well, it has recently
come to my attention

02:34.788 --> 02:36.724
that I am supposed to be
protecting

02:36.757 --> 02:38.659
the guests of this show

02:38.692 --> 02:39.960
from stalkers.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.463
Now, I want you
to be honest with me.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.333
Do you plan on physically
attacking her?

02:45.366 --> 02:48.502
- No, Phil, I'm not planning
on attacking Mariska.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.571
- I've got my eye on you.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.540
- FYI, uh, Jimmy
talked to Mariska,

02:52.573 --> 02:54.342
and they worked out
a special surprise

02:54.375 --> 02:55.776
for tonight's show.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.678
- Well, what is it?
- Well, I don't know.

02:57.711 --> 02:58.746
Jimmy didn't tell me.

02:58.779 --> 02:59.880
- Great.
You know what?

02:59.913 --> 03:00.914
Fantastic.

03:00.948 --> 03:03.451
I have so much to do today,

03:03.484 --> 03:05.586
I'm happy to have Jimmy
take this off my plate.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.688
- You guys,
it's a really special day today.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.390
- Penny!
- Sorry.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.259
It's just normal special,
nothing big special.

03:11.292 --> 03:14.595
It's just so great to get
to work with you every day,

03:14.628 --> 03:16.564
to share an office
with you every day,

03:16.597 --> 03:19.233
to hang out with you all day,
and learn every day.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.635
- Do you think
she's pretty?

03:21.669 --> 03:23.304
Really pretty?

03:23.337 --> 03:24.838
- Obviously.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.707
- It's recently come
to my attention

03:26.740 --> 03:28.776
that I am supposed
to handle stalkers.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.478
Now I'm gonna ask you,
honestly,

03:30.511 --> 03:33.414
are you planning on
physically attacking her?

03:33.447 --> 03:35.449
*

03:35.483 --> 03:36.750
- Hey, gang.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.886
What are we talking about?

03:38.919 --> 03:40.388
- What's up, Todd?

03:40.421 --> 03:42.823
- You're looking
at a director.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.325
- We're looking at a tool.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.859
- No, no, director.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.528
Jimmy's allowing me to direct

03:47.561 --> 03:48.862
the "Todd the Tool" sketch
today.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.431
- Oh, my God, Todd,
that's huge.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.732
Congrats.
- Thank you.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.033
- Why are you telling us?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.902
- 'Cause we're friends.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.604
- Are we?
- Yeah.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.406
Besides Jimmy, you guys
are like my best friends.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.873
- Aw.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.375
We like you too, Todd.

04:01.409 --> 04:02.776
- Thank you.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.912
- I love the wood detailing
on your costume.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.447
- It's not real wood.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.848
It's too soft.

04:07.881 --> 04:11.885
*

04:11.919 --> 04:13.687
- Oh, Mariska.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.022
Staci. Hi.
- Hi, Staci.

04:15.055 --> 04:18.292
- It's so great
to have you on the show.

04:18.326 --> 04:20.428
I just got a call from Jimmy.
- Yeah.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.396
- Can I actually confirm
that you're okay

04:22.430 --> 04:24.298
being eaten by a snake
on the show?

04:24.332 --> 04:25.799
- Oh.
- Can I confirm this?

04:25.833 --> 04:27.635
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
He called me last night.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.437
He told me all about it.
I'm totally game.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.004
- You weren't, uh, drinking?
- No, don't drink.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.906
- Okay, great.
- But, um, I'm--I'm game.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.342
I'm fun.
I'm fearless.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.410
- This day, of all days,
I can't have

04:36.444 --> 04:37.611
a celebrity die.

04:37.645 --> 04:38.912
- Look, I'm sure
that you have

04:38.946 --> 04:40.514
a million safety protocols
in place.

04:40.548 --> 04:42.015
- We actually don't.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.884
This is the first time
we've done this kind of shtick.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.353
But if you're game...
- Oh. [laughing]

04:45.386 --> 04:46.620
You're funny.

04:46.654 --> 04:47.921
I'm sure
it's gonna be fine.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.990
I'm sure it's
gonna be fine.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.361
[dance music playing]

04:53.394 --> 04:55.329
- Hey, Todd,
what's with the music?

04:55.363 --> 04:57.498
- Uh, Tarantino
directs with music on,

04:57.531 --> 04:59.500
so...pbbt, boom.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.034
- Oh, great.
Thank you.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.470
- Shit gonna get cray.

05:02.503 --> 05:03.937
Hey, Rosie,
how you doing?

05:03.971 --> 05:05.373
- Hi.
- I'm Todd.

05:05.406 --> 05:06.774
How you doing?
- Oh, nice to meet you.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.377
And what do you do?
- Oh, I'm the director.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.844
- Oh, I thought
you were the tool.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.380
- [laughing] Oh, yeah.
- [laughs]

05:12.413 --> 05:13.647
- Let's get this baby
started, huh?

05:13.681 --> 05:15.015
All right.
- Okay.

05:15.048 --> 05:17.985
Um, so what exactly
are we doing in this sketch?

05:18.018 --> 05:21.522
Because all it said
was for us to be...

05:21.555 --> 05:23.691
you know, hilarious
and improv, so...

05:23.724 --> 05:25.058
- Yeah, I wrote that
just for you.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.527
You're gonna be great,
yeah.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.962
Just follow what it said
in the script, okay?

05:28.996 --> 05:30.464
All right, and action.

05:30.498 --> 05:32.065
- Got to wait for camera.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.701
- Oh, sorry.
I knew that.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.035
- Camera's ready.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.437
- And action.
- Wait.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.805
You got wait
for sound too, Todd.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.373
- Yeah, I knew that too.

05:39.407 --> 05:40.774
- Sound speeding.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.510
- And action.
- Uh, last looks, last looks.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.844
- Oh. [laughs]

05:43.877 --> 05:46.680
- All right, good.
She's good.

05:46.714 --> 05:47.781
- And action.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.917
- Sorry.
I'm looking for Staci.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.819
- Uh, yeah,
she's somewhere else.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.087
- Oh, she's probably running
around frantically somewhere.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.923
- Okay, I'll find her.
- Uh, excuse me, Mr. Schumacher.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.891
- Yeah?
- They have no idea who you are.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.159
Mr. Schumacher--
- Joel, please.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.861
- Joel, hi.
I'm Marcus.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.496
I can help you find Staci.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.097
- Hey, Marcus.
I can find her.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.633
- Uh, Mr. Schumacher?

06:05.666 --> 06:07.835
- Rosie Perez.
- You know me?

06:07.868 --> 06:09.169
- Of course.
You're Rosie Perez.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.471
So good to see you.
- Oh.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.406
Oh, nice to see you too.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.442
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.176
But I love all your movies.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.446
- Oh, thank you.
I love all your movies too.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.747
- [nervously]
"Batman & Robin"?

06:19.780 --> 06:20.914
- Yeah.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.650
No.
[both laughing]

06:22.683 --> 06:23.884
- You're not that good
an actress.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.419
[both laughing]

06:25.453 --> 06:27.087
Anyway, it's so great
to see you all.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.723
Uh, you're into a skit
or something and...

06:29.757 --> 06:31.091
- That's right, yeah.
This is "Todd the Tool."

06:31.124 --> 06:33.093
I'm Todd.
- You're Todd the Tool.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.662
Can I watch, or is that--

06:34.695 --> 06:36.764
- Yeah, man.
You're famous.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.499
Sit down.
All right.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.701
This is green screen
back here.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.437
I was thinking, like,
that could be your apartment

06:43.471 --> 06:45.706
or specifically
your bathroom, 'cause--

06:45.739 --> 06:48.008
- Could I just
ask a question?

06:48.041 --> 06:50.010
Is there a script?
- It's all in my, uh--

06:50.043 --> 06:51.579
- So you're just--
you're winging it.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.046
- Yeah.
- Well, could we just

06:53.080 --> 06:54.782
deconstruct this?
Would you mind?

06:54.815 --> 06:57.551
So, Todd the Tool,
where were you born?

06:57.585 --> 06:58.619
- Long Island.

06:58.652 --> 06:59.687
- No, I don't mean you.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.622
I mean your character.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.691
- Oh, uh...

07:03.724 --> 07:05.493
the--the toolbox?

07:05.526 --> 07:07.661
- All right, what is
your purpose, then?

07:07.695 --> 07:08.862
You are a hammer.
- Yeah.

07:08.896 --> 07:09.997
- You're a tool,

07:10.030 --> 07:12.600
so you want to be
of service.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.935
You want to serve
people, right?

07:14.968 --> 07:16.470
- Wait, I--sorry.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.005
This isn't that funny,
you know?

07:18.038 --> 07:19.773
Like, no offense.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.509
I don't think you're really
a comedy director.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.976
I know comedy, though, so...

07:23.010 --> 07:24.478
- Why do you know comedy?

07:24.512 --> 07:25.679
- 'Cause I grew up with Jimmy

07:25.713 --> 07:27.247
and he thinks I'm funny

07:27.280 --> 07:29.249
and I laugh at a lot of things.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.018
- Well, you know,
when we're with our friends,

07:31.051 --> 07:32.753
we all think we're funny,
but it's different

07:32.786 --> 07:34.822
than really doing comedy
for an audience.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.490
- Absolutely, yeah.

07:36.524 --> 07:37.891
- Yeah, I agree too.

07:37.925 --> 07:40.794
Hey, good directors' minds
think alike.

07:40.828 --> 07:44.732
*

07:44.765 --> 07:47.000
- I like your choker.
- Oh, thanks.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.602
I wear it
'cause people like it.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.871
- That's why I wear things.
- Hi. Penny.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.674
- Staci,
this is Guy the Snake Guy.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.008
- Hi, Guy.
- Hi. Guy the Snake Guy.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.810
Nice to see you.
- Please tell me

07:56.844 --> 07:58.612
Mariska Hargitay's not gonna die
on "Nightcap" tonight.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.581
- I can't promise
that she's not gonna be killed.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.115
I mean, it's a big snake,
but, I mean,

08:02.149 --> 08:04.585
that's part of the intrigue,
isn't it, though, yeah?

08:04.618 --> 08:05.953
- [grunts]
- Okay.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.121
I'm here.
What's up in the hood?

08:08.155 --> 08:09.957
- Phil, um,
we're just going over

08:09.990 --> 08:11.592
with Guy the Snake Guy guy

08:11.625 --> 08:13.293
the Mariska Hargitay stunt.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.729
- "Everybody knows
I hate snakes."

08:15.763 --> 08:18.932
That's "Indiana Jones."

08:18.966 --> 08:20.300
- Phil, you need
to pay attention

08:20.333 --> 08:21.969
in case something
goes wrong.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.137
- Ah, I guess
I'll probably be ready.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.273
- Oh, Mariska, hi.
Oh, great.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.208
Um, this is Guy the Snake Guy.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.877
- So excited.
Happy to be here. Huge fan.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.144
- Yeah, you ready to be
a snake's dinner?

08:31.178 --> 08:32.946
- Yeah.
[both laughing]

08:32.980 --> 08:35.215
Funny.
- You sure you want to do this?

08:35.248 --> 08:36.784
- I'm absolutely sure.
It's gonna be fine.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.552
She's got to stop
talking me out of this.

08:38.586 --> 08:39.920
- It's just,
I don't want you to die.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.121
You've got, like,
15 kids.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.723
- I do.
It's gonna be fine.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.291
- Okay, well, Guy,
tell me if I'm wrong,

08:44.324 --> 08:47.027
but don't anacondas
eventually squeeze the life

08:47.060 --> 08:48.629
out of a human being?

08:48.662 --> 08:51.098
- Are you a snake expert
all of a sudden?

08:51.131 --> 08:52.299
- Ah.
- Seriously, Mariska,

08:52.332 --> 08:54.001
in the wild, these anacondas,

08:54.034 --> 08:57.204
they strangle their prey
lifeless and dead, yeah?

08:57.237 --> 08:58.906
And then they devour it.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.207
But not this snake.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.175
I've trained it
to skip the first step.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.311
Perfect. Just don't move.
- Okay, I won't move.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.313
But what--what if--
what if I move?

09:06.346 --> 09:08.248
- Crush your whole body.
It'd be a bloody mess.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.750
I mean horrible.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.184
- Oh, oh, okay.
Well, then I won't.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.286
I won't move.
- Yeah, don't move.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.122
- Okay.
[laughs]

09:15.155 --> 09:16.724
- You can't move.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.859
- Yeah, like, don't move.
Yeah, yeah.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.160
*

09:21.929 --> 09:25.599
[lively trumpet music]

09:25.633 --> 09:27.367
- All right, now,
this is how it's gonna go.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.036
Mariska's laying
down here, yeah?

09:29.069 --> 09:30.804
And I've trained the snake

09:30.838 --> 09:32.706
to start on
the special material

09:32.740 --> 09:35.308
and swallow all the way
up to the top right around here.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.010
You comfortable with that?
- Yep, got it.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.846
- Now, to make sure that you're
good under pressure...

09:38.879 --> 09:40.080
- Mm-hmm.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.381
- I'm gonna pretend
I'm the snake.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.651
Just as a little test, yeah?
- Got it.

09:43.684 --> 09:44.918
- The snake starts out
right here.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.353
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, it's not moving.

09:46.386 --> 09:47.921
What's going on?
How's this gonna work?

09:47.955 --> 09:48.989
I don't know.
Is it asleep?

09:49.022 --> 09:50.223
Bam!
- Oh, God!

09:50.257 --> 09:52.359
- See?
And that's how fast it is.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.361
Right up on your ankles
there, Mariska.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.696
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, a little tight.

09:55.729 --> 09:56.897
A little sticky, a little slimy.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.932
Right up again.
[slurping]

09:58.966 --> 10:00.167
Feel it? Yeah? Yeah?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.702
[hissing]

10:01.735 --> 10:03.303
Ah, it's up on your gams now,
yeah?

10:03.336 --> 10:04.905
That's a little tight, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.339
- Yeah, all right now,
it's coming up here,

10:06.373 --> 10:08.642
and as soon as it reaches
your knees and your thighs,

10:08.676 --> 10:10.277
you start to feel a little
tingle down by your ankles.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.912
Don't panic.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.114
That's the snake's
stomach acid.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.716
And it's gonna tickle.
- Okay.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.317
- But you can't let it
make you move.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.419
- Don't move.
- That goes for everyone.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.321
No moving.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.691
Up, up, and its lips
get swollen

10:23.724 --> 10:26.226
with all of its slobber,
and it's right here.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.828
Yeah, can you handle it?
- Yep.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.763
- And it falls asleep,
Mariska.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.066
[inhales sharply]
And it wakes up.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.768
And it looks in your eyes.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.269
And if it wasn't,
it'll just go right there!

10:36.303 --> 10:37.838
But don't worry,

10:37.871 --> 10:39.439
because I've trained it
not to go farther up.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.108
Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.676
- It knows what to do,
and it starts...

10:42.710 --> 10:44.845
[inhales sharply]
Releasing

10:44.878 --> 10:46.947
back all the way down

10:46.980 --> 10:48.181
till you're free,

10:48.215 --> 10:49.382
and the segment's over.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.818
- Great.
- Brilliant, yeah?

10:50.851 --> 10:52.152
- Yeah.
So I'm ready, right?

10:52.185 --> 10:53.420
- Yeah, I think
you're ready, Mariska.

10:53.453 --> 10:54.855
- Okay.
- That's really impressive.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.123
- Thanks.
- I'm gonna go make sure

10:56.156 --> 10:57.825
the snake's ready.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.293
It's time for its dinner,
and it's pretty cranky.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.231
- Wow, I've got
to hand it to him.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.900
I really believed
he was the snake.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.902
*

11:08.936 --> 11:10.904
- Okay, guys.
so far, so good,

11:10.938 --> 11:12.105
but let's do it again.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.807
Last looks, please.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.909
- Yeah, let's go again.
Last looks.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.979
Go to do some...
[clears throat]

11:19.012 --> 11:21.014
Director's notes here.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.783
Okay, Rosie,
that was great.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.117
Just want to do it
one more time,

11:24.151 --> 11:26.720
and, like, do it, um,
you know, funnier.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.221
- You're telling me
to be funnier?

11:28.255 --> 11:30.290
- Eh, you know, just, like...

11:30.323 --> 11:32.392
funnier, you know?

11:32.425 --> 11:33.894
Like, funnier...
I'm funny.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.395
[chuckles]
Like "White Men Can't Jump."

11:35.428 --> 11:37.030
- Yeah, well,
"White Men Can't Jump"

11:37.064 --> 11:39.032
was an excellent script.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.134
- Well, you know, the script
is really a foundation.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.435
- Great.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.137
- You know, Todd, I'm sorry

11:44.171 --> 11:46.239
if I've been stepping
on your toes, really,

11:46.273 --> 11:49.109
and, I mean,
this is your comedy skit,

11:49.142 --> 11:51.278
and I don't want to piss
on your parade.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.213
- Mr. Schumacher, no,
Todd is trying to say

11:53.246 --> 11:55.115
that he's very grateful
for this opportunity

11:55.148 --> 11:57.050
to learn from a master
like yourself.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.952
- Well, I'm not a master,
but since you said that,

11:58.986 --> 12:00.253
let's go again.

12:00.287 --> 12:01.955
Let's pick up the pace.

12:01.989 --> 12:03.290
[bang]
- Ow.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.092
- Uh, something wrong?

12:05.125 --> 12:06.960
- No, nothing's wrong.

12:06.994 --> 12:08.161
I'm just angry.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.863
- Use it.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.031
*

12:12.332 --> 12:13.500
- Oh, hello.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.268
Welcome to
"The Wendy Williams Show."

12:15.302 --> 12:18.371
- Hi, I'm St--
- Staci Cole, right?

12:18.405 --> 12:20.073
- How did you know?
- It's my job to know

12:20.107 --> 12:22.142
everyone who comes
in and out of here.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.211
Our security guard
will check you in.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.545
- Hi there.
- Oh, hi.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.380
- Oh, can I offer you
something to drink

12:27.414 --> 12:29.817
while you wait--
a macchiato, espresso,

12:29.850 --> 12:31.819
cappuccino,
matcha green tea latte?

12:31.852 --> 12:33.320
- Oh, listen, you don't have
to go out and get me anything.

12:33.353 --> 12:34.387
I'm--
- Oh.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.123
We have a full-time barista.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.859
[all laughing]
- Oh, you do?

12:38.892 --> 12:40.327
All right,
I'll have a chai latte.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.395
- Perfect.
Oh, and help yourself

12:42.429 --> 12:46.066
to any baked gluten-free items
and some fresh fruit.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.267
- Is this always here?

12:47.300 --> 12:48.936
- Of course.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.939
Wendy takes the health
of her employees very seriously.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.107
- Wow.
- [giggles]

12:54.141 --> 12:55.442
- Now, Ms. Cole,
if you wouldn't mind

12:55.475 --> 12:57.244
just placing your thumbprint
there on that pad

12:57.277 --> 13:00.113
and looking directly
into this camera.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.114
- Oh.
[chuckles]

13:01.148 --> 13:02.149
It's like the Pentagon.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.416
- The--oh.

13:03.450 --> 13:06.053
[both laugh]
You're very funny.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.554
- Oh, you've very strong
and capable.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.356
- Well, it's my job
to serve and protect

13:09.389 --> 13:10.924
everyone here at this show.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.425
I take it very seriously,

13:12.459 --> 13:14.294
as each and every employee,
from top to bottom,

13:14.327 --> 13:17.030
is a equally important asset
here at "Wendy Williams."

13:17.064 --> 13:18.498
As Wendy always says,

13:18.531 --> 13:21.401
without any one of us,
this show would be nothing.

13:21.434 --> 13:25.472
- And here is your chai latte,
Ms. Cole.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.274
And Wendy's ready
to see you now.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.142
- Right.
Oh, my God, it's porcelain.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.377
- [laughs]
- Bye now.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.279
- Bye. Bye.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.081
This is exciting.

13:35.615 --> 13:38.451
[lively trumpet music]

13:38.485 --> 13:40.954
- Okay, so I think
when Todd says,

13:40.988 --> 13:42.255
"Hey, I'm Todd the Tool,"

13:42.289 --> 13:43.924
you should, like,
hit my--

13:43.957 --> 13:45.125
- Could I just say one--

13:45.158 --> 13:46.559
- No, you can't.
- All right.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.061
- I'm--jeez.

13:48.095 --> 13:50.230
Enough with your awesome notes,
okay?

13:50.263 --> 13:52.099
I can't do this anymore.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.333
I can't!
It's--

13:53.366 --> 13:55.068
You're not the director,
okay?

13:55.102 --> 13:56.904
I'm the director,
okay?

13:56.937 --> 13:58.071
I'm the funny one!

13:58.105 --> 13:59.973
You're just my sidekick.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.109
I'm the funny one.
America loves me.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.277
"Just sit in the shadows, Todd,

14:04.311 --> 14:06.947
and just be appreciative
for what you've got."

14:06.980 --> 14:08.148
Shut up, Jimmy!

14:08.181 --> 14:09.549
Shut up, man!

14:09.582 --> 14:12.585
This is my thing,
my thing here!

14:12.619 --> 14:15.088
- I am so glad
I was here for that.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.924
- Shut up, Marcus.
- All right.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.292
- I'm sorry.
[sighs and groans]

14:19.326 --> 14:20.627
I'm just upset.

14:20.660 --> 14:23.396
- Could I ask you guys
to step out for a second?

14:23.430 --> 14:24.664
- Absolutely.
- Don't worry, Todd.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.366
They'll be right back.
- Yeah.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.035
Yeah.

14:30.137 --> 14:31.404
- Okay.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.373
Take a deep breath.
Relax.

14:33.406 --> 14:34.541
This has been--
you know,

14:34.574 --> 14:36.009
there's been
a lot of tension,

14:36.043 --> 14:37.244
a lot of stress on you,
I know.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.512
- Yeah.
- I...

14:39.546 --> 14:41.481
I don't think this
is between you and me,

14:41.514 --> 14:43.383
and I'm sorry
if I've stepped on your toes.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.052
- No, no.
- But I think it's between

14:45.085 --> 14:47.287
you and Jimmy.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.656
- Yeah.
- Jimmy's your boss.

14:49.689 --> 14:52.092
And this is his show.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.660
You got to step up,

14:53.693 --> 14:56.163
and you've got to step
out of his shadow.

14:56.196 --> 14:59.099
You be a director

14:59.132 --> 15:01.201
and separate yourself

15:01.234 --> 15:04.604
from trying to please
Jimmy all the time.

15:04.637 --> 15:08.008
- Yeah.
- I want you to finish this skit

15:08.041 --> 15:10.243
and really put
your ass into it.

15:10.277 --> 15:13.046
You can do this.
- Okay.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.447
- Okay?
- Yeah.

15:14.481 --> 15:15.715
Can I give you a hug?

15:15.748 --> 15:17.584
- Sure.
- Aw.

15:17.617 --> 15:20.020
[grunts]
Thank you so much, Jimmy.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.322
Oh.

15:22.355 --> 15:25.458
- I think you've just missed
the whole point of that, Todd.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.560
I'm gonna go watch
Mariska Hargitay

15:27.594 --> 15:29.529
get swallowed by a snake.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.664
I'll send them back in.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.533
- I'm sorry, Mariska.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.168
I'm just having trouble
finding a place to attach this.

15:35.202 --> 15:36.603
- Oh, that's okay.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.705
- You're such a pro.
- [laughs] Thank you.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.640
- You're really pretty.
Anybody ever tell you that?

15:40.673 --> 15:42.009
- Okay.
- I actually don't mind

15:42.042 --> 15:43.376
if this takes
a little bit longer.

15:43.410 --> 15:44.511
- [laughing] Yeah.
It's okay. I got it.

15:44.544 --> 15:45.712
Thanks so much.
- I'm--okay.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.281
- Stand down.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.150
- I've seen every episode
of your show.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.985
- Thank you.
- Hey, stand down.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.653
- Phil, we're talking
here, okay?

15:53.686 --> 15:55.622
- I said stand down!

15:55.655 --> 15:57.257
I've got a Taser
somewhere on me,

15:57.290 --> 15:58.391
and I'm not afraid
to use it.

15:58.425 --> 15:59.592
- What are you doing, Phil?

15:59.626 --> 16:02.095
Phil!
- Is everything okay here?

16:02.129 --> 16:04.397
- Well, things are much safer
now that those two are gone.

16:04.431 --> 16:05.732
- Okay.
- Okay, guys.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.534
So our segment
is up next.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.436
Any last instructions
for Mariska?

16:09.469 --> 16:10.737
- No, I mean,
she looks great.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.605
You look great, Mariska.
Just don't move.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.341
Don't twitch.
Don't move a muscle.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.675
Don't move.
That's all you got to remember.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.210
If the snake begins
to coil around you,

16:17.244 --> 16:18.278
there's literally nothing
I can do.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.546
It's an endangered species.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.081
- Don't you have,
like, a Taser

16:21.114 --> 16:22.249
or something,
a zapper?

16:22.282 --> 16:24.017
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, absolutely.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.585
I'm not an idiot.
But I can't use it.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.520
It's an endangered species.
They'll throw me in jail.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.122
Those PETA bastards
are crazy.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.258
- So I'd just suffocate.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.360
- Uh, yeah.
I mean, you'd pass out,

16:33.393 --> 16:34.561
and, you know,
you'd convulse.

16:34.594 --> 16:35.795
Your eyes go back
in your head,

16:35.828 --> 16:37.264
drooling kind of stuff,
you know?

16:37.297 --> 16:39.732
But yeah, yeah,
you'd die, yeah.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.134
- Okay.
Let's do this.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.135
- All right, guys,
here we go.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.171
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.272
Don't die.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.273
[upbeat music playing]

16:46.306 --> 16:47.407
[cheers and applause]

16:47.440 --> 16:49.376
- So how'd you like
the office

16:49.409 --> 16:51.811
at "The Wendy Williams Show"?

16:51.844 --> 16:53.213
- What are you
talking about?

16:53.246 --> 16:55.115
- You know I know everything.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.384
- It went well.
It went--it went well.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.419
I didn't get it, though.
- Bitch, are you deaf?

16:59.452 --> 17:01.521
Didn't you just hear me say
I know everything?

17:01.554 --> 17:02.822
I know you got that job.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.324
Don't you know
black girls talk?

17:04.357 --> 17:06.193
Wendy is my client.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.760
- It just didn't seem
right for me, you know?

17:07.794 --> 17:10.530
It's so perfect.
It's like a well-oiled machine.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.565
I wouldn't fit in.
- Wendy obviously knows

17:12.599 --> 17:15.402
that you're good at what you do
and that you'd be an asset.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.836
You'd kick ass over there,

17:16.869 --> 17:18.805
and you'd make a lot more money
than you do here,

17:18.838 --> 17:20.807
but it doesn't take a genius
to see that you're too scared

17:20.840 --> 17:22.342
to leave this steaming pile
of shit

17:22.375 --> 17:24.177
you got going on over here.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.146
- Well, I can't leave "Nightcap"
high and dry.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.814
I mean, I've organized
everything,

17:27.847 --> 17:29.749
and Jimmy can't possibly--
- Oh, stop it.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.384
They'd replace you
in 2.5 seconds

17:31.418 --> 17:32.652
without even missing a beat.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.421
There is a Staci Cole
on every street corner

17:34.454 --> 17:36.156
in this city, girl.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.325
- Is this supposed to be
a motivational speech?

17:38.358 --> 17:40.560
- No!
This is a fuckin' wake-up call.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.695
You had the opportunity
for upward mobility,

17:42.729 --> 17:45.398
to work side by side with
a strong and powerful sister

17:45.432 --> 17:48.401
like yourself, and you're
too chickenshit to take it.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.470
You need to do like
that Sheryl Sandberg says

17:50.503 --> 17:52.405
and lean in, bitch!

17:52.439 --> 17:54.407
- [huffs]

17:54.441 --> 17:55.575
Okay.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.377
I'm gonna lean in.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.146
I'm gonna lean in hard.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.248
I'm gonna take that job
at "Wendy Williams."

18:01.281 --> 18:03.716
- Well, it's too late, because
she already hired somebody else.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.552
- What?
- And you are obviously

18:05.585 --> 18:07.520
not ready to leave this place.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.389
[cheers and applause]
- She moved! She moved!

18:09.422 --> 18:10.523
She moved!

18:10.557 --> 18:13.160
- Mariska?
- It encased her!

18:13.193 --> 18:15.162
- Oh, my God!
Get me my scissors!

18:15.195 --> 18:19.399
*

18:19.432 --> 18:20.467
- Hey, good news.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.734
Mariska's gonna be fine.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.170
Her bones are broken

18:23.203 --> 18:24.771
but only on the right side
of her body.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.340
- Well, you know what?
It's not my fault.

18:27.374 --> 18:29.876
It was Jimmy's idea.
My hands are clean.

18:29.909 --> 18:32.379
- Hey, they're requesting us
in the conference room.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.781
- Why?
- Some sort of HR meeting.

18:37.184 --> 18:39.919
- If there's an ice cream cake,
we'd better hurry up.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.355
- Oh, but, Staci, you said
that you didn't want us

18:42.389 --> 18:44.291
to celebrate your birthday--
- Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny,

18:44.324 --> 18:46.326
Penny, Penny, Penny...

18:46.359 --> 18:47.660
[chuckling]

18:47.694 --> 18:49.562
Let's go to the HR meeting.

18:50.763 --> 18:53.266
*

18:53.300 --> 18:55.168
- Uh, there's
nothing planned, Staci.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.869
- All right, I'm gonna
close my eyes.

18:56.903 --> 18:59.672
- No, um, you don't
have to close your eyes.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.409
- [chuckles]
This is actually kind of fun.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.843
- Um...
- All right.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.646
Afternoon meeting?
That's rich.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.648
All right,
I'm gonna open my eyes.

19:08.681 --> 19:09.916
- Probably should.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.489
- [laughs]
Okay.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.191
Okay, Penny.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.960
- No, St--Staci, um--
- Oh, all right.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.230
Hello, Mr. Stripper.

19:23.263 --> 19:24.964
- Uh, I'm Lawrence
from HR.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.633
- What's the matter?
The cop was booked?

19:26.666 --> 19:28.435
Oh, you're Lawrence from HR.

19:28.468 --> 19:29.969
Well, I'm Staci
from Talent.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.305
[laughs] Hey, let's get
this party started.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.506
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey!

19:33.540 --> 19:34.707
- Oh, he's got a boom box.

19:34.741 --> 19:35.975
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop--
- Yeah!

19:36.008 --> 19:37.244
- Whoa! Stop it.
- We're doing it.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.645
Oh, you like it
a different way?

19:38.678 --> 19:40.513
Yeah. Come on, let's go.
- Oh, stop.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.249
[muffled yelling]
- Play with the fun bags!

19:42.282 --> 19:43.650
Play with the fun bags!

19:43.683 --> 19:45.252
Yeah, whoo!
- I'm--

19:45.285 --> 19:48.288
I really am Lawrence
from HR.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.526
- He's really from HR.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.694
- [mouths word]

19:54.727 --> 19:56.296
- [sighs]

20:03.403 --> 20:06.273
- Okay.
- As I was saying,

20:06.306 --> 20:10.543
um, we've had several cases
of interstitial lung disease

20:10.577 --> 20:13.513
in the building,
and we think it's linked

20:13.546 --> 20:16.249
to lead poisoning,

20:16.283 --> 20:17.784
and we need to test everyone.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.587
Yeah, I'm sorry.
And who are you?

20:20.620 --> 20:23.656
- I'm Staci from Talent.

20:23.690 --> 20:26.459
It's my birthday.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.595
- Happy birthday.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.597
If everyone would open
their pamphlets

20:30.630 --> 20:32.799
on "How to Manage
Interstitial Lung Disease

20:32.832 --> 20:34.901
"and Keep Working:
Everything You Need to Know

20:34.934 --> 20:36.669
to Stay Productive and Alive,"

20:36.703 --> 20:38.371
you'll notice
in the left column,

20:38.405 --> 20:40.973
filing for time off,
that is strongly discouraged.

20:41.007 --> 20:44.043
We feel that if you just
rest up over the weekend,

20:44.076 --> 20:45.812
you'll be good to go
on Monday.

20:45.845 --> 20:48.415
I would, however, like
to go over some of the symptoms

20:48.448 --> 20:50.583
you may encounter with ILD.

20:50.617 --> 20:51.918
For starters,
you may experience

20:51.951 --> 20:54.387
loose or bloody stools.
