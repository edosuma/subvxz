01:39.182 --> 01:42.935
Then I took it out to eat it.

01:45.396 --> 01:46.939
It was...

01:48.566 --> 01:50.067
this big.

01:50.777 --> 01:56.740
Yellow, tasty looking sponge cake.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.451
I held it in my bosom all day.

02:01.579 --> 02:06.250
Then I saw a girl carrying
her sister on her back.

02:07.085 --> 02:09.544
Looked obvious
they were starving.

02:10.463 --> 02:16.718
So pale, weak and helpless

02:18.096 --> 02:21.181
I turned away to eat it.

02:21.182 --> 02:26.937
But I ended up giving it to them.

02:28.481 --> 02:32.276
It must've been warm since

02:32.694 --> 02:35.904
I carried it around all day.

02:38.283 --> 02:44.538
I didn't know if I'll ever
have cake like that again.

02:48.585 --> 02:53.463
She gobbled it down and shoved
some in her sisters mouth.

02:54.883 --> 02:58.552
Think God will remember that?

02:58.595 --> 03:00.470
Though its been 30 years?

03:03.224 --> 03:04.474
Absoposilutely.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.810
Remembering is His specialty.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.021
Of course.

03:09.772 --> 03:18.530
That song, Father Can you
play it for me, again?

03:44.265 --> 03:46.099
You can do CPR, right?

03:49.687 --> 03:50.646
Go!

03:53.191 --> 03:54.107
Stop!

03:57.570 --> 03:58.528
Again!

04:10.708 --> 04:11.667
200 Joules.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.013
Charge.

04:28.309 --> 04:31.561
Those who seek direct communication
with God are prone to self-hatred...

04:31.562 --> 04:36.858
The Devil will eat right into you.

04:36.859 --> 04:40.279
As St. Bruno said, 'Suicide
is to die a martyr for Satan.'

04:41.322 --> 04:44.283
It's worse than first degree murder.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.827
It's worth a life sentence...
in hell.

04:49.872 --> 04:52.249
20 Hail Mary's, get
lots of sun

04:52.292 --> 04:53.834
and take a cold shower.

04:54.043 --> 05:00.465
Get Gods help through science
and take some anti-depressants

05:02.677 --> 05:04.136
Stop thinking about
killing yourself.

05:04.137 --> 05:08.265
And... forget the
bastard who dumped you.

05:15.690 --> 05:16.857
Father...

05:18.067 --> 05:21.111
Ill deal with the bastards
and the worldly matters.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.614
You just stick to praying, Father.

05:25.867 --> 05:29.536
Ask the bishop to send
me to Emmanuel Labs, please?

05:31.039 --> 05:36.043
The Vatican does not
approve ofthat experiment.

05:37.587 --> 05:41.757
Sarah died on Monday
even after 8 surgeries.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.634
Hyo-sung went into
a coma yesterday.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.389
It kills me to watch them dying.

05:50.058 --> 05:55.187
No one knows what
really goes on at that lab.

05:57.065 --> 05:59.358
I want to save people.

06:01.861 --> 06:05.197
I told you to go to med school
since you were in the crib,

06:05.239 --> 06:08.533
study ophthalmology,
and heal my eyes.

06:08.576 --> 06:11.203
But Father, I must go and...

06:11.245 --> 06:14.122
Enough! I'll just give you absolution.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.462
Stick to the confession!
Geeze!

06:24.092 --> 06:27.552
Dear patients, I regret not
seeing you before I left.

06:28.763 --> 06:31.431
I was busy preparing
for my sudden vacation.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.644
I packed a bunch ofthings.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.230
But they say to bring my body only.

06:38.231 --> 06:42.234
The monastery prepared a
luxurious hotel for me.

06:42.235 --> 06:45.112
Fr. Emmanuel Memorial
Biochemical Labs
At times like this
I'm glad I joined The Order.

08:58.246 --> 09:02.123
Grant me the following in the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ

09:03.376 --> 09:06.753
Like a leper rotting in flesh,
let all avoid me.

09:07.880 --> 09:12.133
Like a cripple without limbs,
let me not move freely.

09:14.136 --> 09:17.722
Remove my cheeks,
that tears may not roll down them.

09:18.683 --> 09:22.727
Crush my lips and tongue,
that I may not sin with them.

09:23.062 --> 09:26.565
Pull out my nails
that I may grasp nothing.

09:26.607 --> 09:30.235
Let my shoulders and back be bent
that I may carry nothing.

09:32.780 --> 09:36.575
Like a man with tumor in the head
let me lackjudgment.

09:38.077 --> 09:42.038
Ravage my body sworn to chastity
leave me with no pride,

09:42.081 --> 09:44.165
and have me live in shame.

09:45.376 --> 09:47.544
Let no one pray for me.

09:47.587 --> 09:51.923
But only the grace ofthe Lord
Jesus Christ have mercy on me.

10:01.058 --> 10:02.767
A month has gone by already.

10:03.603 --> 10:08.440
Watching the grand view through
the window is more fun than TV.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.068
The hotel owner gave me
her best room,

10:12.069 --> 10:14.446
saying I'm handsome.

10:15.698 --> 10:19.326
Thanks to all the sunlight
my skin is tanned and peeling.

12:06.976 --> 12:09.853
Time of death, 3:31 p.m.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.241
Grant me the following

12:23.284 --> 12:26.161
in the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ.

12:27.288 --> 12:30.957
Like a leper rotting in flesh,
let all avoid me.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.042
Like a cripple without limbs...

12:33.043 --> 12:35.211
His skin...

12:37.173 --> 12:38.590
let me not move freely...

12:40.801 --> 12:42.594
6 months later

12:54.815 --> 12:56.608
Touch my leg, Father!

12:56.650 --> 12:59.611
Please pray for me, Father!

12:59.653 --> 13:01.237
Please, Father?

13:02.072 --> 13:05.074
My daughter has leukemia!

13:19.089 --> 13:21.341
You know how much he talked

13:21.884 --> 13:24.135
Saying the pain is killing him,

13:24.178 --> 13:27.347
but still on and on about
the sponge cakes, this and that.

13:27.389 --> 13:28.348
That very day,

13:29.642 --> 13:34.145
I was about to doze off after a long
night shift when I was paged.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.272
A thought crossed my mind.

13:37.817 --> 13:41.528
What if I walked a little slowly,
just a little.

13:42.279 --> 13:45.240
If he passed away now, he'd only be
two months earlier than expected.

13:46.867 --> 13:50.537
I thought my life would be a lot
more bearable without him.

13:50.538 --> 13:53.414
By the time I arrived
on dragging feet

13:54.875 --> 14:00.129
hypoxia had lead to a brain damage
and he had already gone quiet.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.883
He's been in that state for a year now.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.053
He's still my patient, and.. .

14:09.098 --> 14:11.558
every time I see him, I feel.. .

14:11.559 --> 14:14.686
You feel terrible about it?

14:14.728 --> 14:18.314
Not... terrible,

14:19.275 --> 14:20.942
but uncomfortable.

14:21.735 --> 14:24.863
Thought I'd let him go two months earlier
and he's still around after a year.

14:26.282 --> 14:29.242
It's a miracle that he is still alive.

14:30.077 --> 14:33.872
They say it's thanks to your prayers.

14:41.922 --> 14:44.048
Dermatologists would be
happy to see this.

14:45.092 --> 14:50.138
All the numbers indicate
you're healing up incredibly fast.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.849
What's it like, being a man of miracle?

14:54.727 --> 14:57.729
I've become strangely sensitive
to sound and smell.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.732
It makes me feel dizzy and nauseous.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.943
The symptoms aren't related to EV,

15:05.362 --> 15:07.071
but more like a pregnancy.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.501
I heard...

15:21.754 --> 15:26.507
people are coming to seek prayers
from The Bandaged Saint?

15:27.384 --> 15:29.719
Don't know how that
nonsense started.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.518
Though I did hear
of some people getting cured.

15:39.563 --> 15:42.148
Guess it can have
a psychological effect.

15:43.567 --> 15:47.362
After all, you're the only one
who survived out of 50 volunteers.

15:49.782 --> 15:50.740
Right?

15:53.535 --> 15:58.247
Wow! You're so lucky!

16:14.181 --> 16:17.558
Are you the miracle
survivor out of 500?

16:18.268 --> 16:21.437
My son has cancer!

16:22.481 --> 16:25.066
Please pray for him!

16:26.986 --> 16:31.030
It's just a psychological effect
Theres nothing I can do.

16:35.828 --> 16:36.828
Look.

16:48.590 --> 16:50.049
Channel 9 won't come on, Mom.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.342
Let's pray kids.

16:57.391 --> 17:01.519
Did you ever live in Busan?

17:04.356 --> 17:08.608
We are gathered here
to pray for Kang-woo.

17:10.069 --> 17:12.530
Born under Your grace and love,

17:13.656 --> 17:16.909
embracing even
a wounded street dog...

17:18.078 --> 17:20.538
he was a kind hearted boy.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.624
Remember his goodness
and have mercy on him.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.545
In Jesus' name we pray.

17:27.588 --> 17:28.629
- Amen.
- Amen.

17:31.008 --> 17:37.805
I don't believe in this
but since it's from an old friend...

17:42.853 --> 17:44.645
Now, I recognize you, son.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.231
Sorry. You're a Father, now.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.652
Im sorry, Father.

17:54.948 --> 17:58.076
You used to come over
for noodles.

17:58.118 --> 18:02.371
Fifth grade, right?
You lived at the church orphanage?

18:03.791 --> 18:05.666
My son could never pass stray

18:05.667 --> 18:09.337
cats and was so good
to the orphans.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.924
Your sister was so shy and
ran out whenever I came over.

18:14.551 --> 18:19.138
She had calluses on her feet
and Kang-woo made me touch them.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.355
Her parents rented
a small room in our house.

18:28.941 --> 18:32.443
Her father was
a high school drop out.

18:32.945 --> 18:37.949
This is my blood shed for
you so that sins may be forgiven.

18:38.200 --> 18:43.538
One day, they left her in my room
and said they'd be back soon.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.915
But they never came back!

18:46.959 --> 18:49.710
So I took the three-year-old

18:49.753 --> 18:52.713
in and raised her
like a daughter and puppy.

18:53.173 --> 18:55.550
Happy Hanbok
Shed call me 'mommy'

18:55.968 --> 18:57.844
I'm her mommy-in-law, now.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.641
Marriage was no big deal.

19:04.184 --> 19:07.854
She just moved from sleeping
in my bed to Kang-woo's.

19:11.108 --> 19:15.820
Why'd you buy the laver
at that place again, Mom?

19:16.864 --> 19:24.453
I told you it's no good and
the owner's a cocksucker

19:55.777 --> 19:57.153
You hate Kimbap?

19:58.197 --> 20:01.657
No, I'm sensitive to smell
these days.

20:02.367 --> 20:05.036
I suddenly got a whiff of blood.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.042
Kang-woos home.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.253
- Mom, I caught a cold!
- What?

20:14.296 --> 20:15.671
Hi, Sang-hyun!

20:15.672 --> 20:17.757
I told you
to wear your long johns.

20:17.799 --> 20:20.635
- Were here, too
- Welcome.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.012
My friend the priest.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.265
This is our dam's
manager and his wife.

20:26.266 --> 20:29.727
It's an honor, Father
I'm Young-du

20:29.770 --> 20:32.647
She's a Filipina
so she's Catholic.

20:32.689 --> 20:34.732
Say hello, Evelyn.

20:43.200 --> 20:47.036
- Tae-ju!
- How've you been?

20:53.293 --> 20:56.337
Here comes the Police Chief!

20:56.672 --> 21:01.717
Please, I quit
the force a long time ago.

21:03.136 --> 21:05.638
He's the dam's security
head This is Fr. Hyun, Sang-hyun

21:05.681 --> 21:06.722
Hello.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.349
Do you like fishing Father?

21:08.392 --> 21:13.020
Get on his good side and you
can fish there though its banned.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.731
Daytimes a bit tricky.
Come by at nights.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.859
- Have a seat, Father
- Let's get started.

21:23.490 --> 21:27.910
Koreans don't
appreciate Mahjong.

21:29.955 --> 21:33.124
Would you like to play, Father?

21:33.125 --> 21:36.127
- Sorry. I don't know how
- I see.

21:38.130 --> 21:42.008
Did I tell you about Father Hyun
praying for Kang-woo?

21:43.969 --> 21:47.471
I was standing right
next to my son.

21:47.889 --> 21:52.852
Suddenly, I felt something hot
come down on my head.

21:52.894 --> 21:59.150
I felt tingly all over like
someone was poking me with needles.

22:02.362 --> 22:07.450
Then my boy said
'It feels hot right here, Mom.'

22:10.662 --> 22:13.039
Then the cancer vanished.

22:13.582 --> 22:14.832
It vanished?

22:17.502 --> 22:20.129
You always feel tingly
cuz of your blood pressure.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.757
But I did a biopsyjust in case.

22:25.177 --> 22:29.764
The endoscope showed
it was esophagus cancer.

22:30.390 --> 22:33.100
Women shouldn't
get sedated endoscopes.

22:33.560 --> 22:37.813
Doctors secretly rape them.

22:44.488 --> 22:45.654
I win!

22:46.948 --> 22:49.950
Three closed triplets!

22:50.410 --> 22:51.952
That's 8 points.

22:55.957 --> 22:59.835
Can we turn the heater down?

23:00.587 --> 23:01.545
But I'm cold.

23:04.174 --> 23:05.466
Kang-woo says he's cold!

23:06.760 --> 23:09.929
Thank you very much.

23:36.873 --> 23:38.666
I'm losing so much.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.836
Instead ofthe hot water bag!

24:14.870 --> 24:16.829
I'm going down to get
the lights in the store.

25:29.152 --> 25:30.945
Don't you love our Mahjong gang?

25:35.992 --> 25:38.244
Wednesdays. Mercury. Water.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.829
Oasis! How's that
for our gang's name?

28:46.766 --> 28:49.017
She's a Catholic Veronica.

28:50.270 --> 28:52.229
She was in a bad hit-and-run.

28:54.357 --> 28:56.150
Lost a lot of blood.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.235
She doesn't have much time.

29:03.783 --> 29:05.868
Let this water call to mind
your baptismal sharing...

29:05.910 --> 29:10.038
in Christ's redeeming
passion and resurrection.

29:11.708 --> 29:14.835
Veronica. Make your confession.

29:36.483 --> 29:41.612
By the power the apostolic See
has given me in the name ofthe...

29:41.654 --> 29:43.530
Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit, I grant you

29:43.573 --> 29:44.615
a plenary indulgence and...

29:50.163 --> 29:52.122
pardon for all your sins.

29:52.165 --> 29:53.123
Amen.

29:57.086 --> 29:59.630
Through this holy anointing...

30:01.966 --> 30:04.134
may the Lord in his
love and mercy help you...

30:06.638 --> 30:09.973
with the grace ofthe Holy Spirit.

30:12.560 --> 30:13.644
And...

30:14.813 --> 30:17.272
may the Lord who
frees you from sin...

30:18.191 --> 30:22.236
save you and raise you up.

30:24.364 --> 30:25.239
Amen.

34:22.768 --> 34:24.728
Where'd you wander
offto this time?

34:26.856 --> 34:29.815
I woke up I was at the pharmacy.

34:29.859 --> 34:31.902
And some man walked past.

34:32.862 --> 34:35.155
Aren't there pills
for sleepwalking?

34:36.491 --> 34:39.159
I should lock your room
from the outside.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.911
Should've got me pills
for my cold.

34:42.789 --> 34:43.830
Weren't you cold?

34:44.498 --> 34:46.166
You never catch a cold.

34:49.670 --> 34:51.254
She's a Yeti, Mom.

35:00.848 --> 35:02.808
Smells like
when you had gastritis.

35:03.267 --> 35:05.143
I'll go find the pills.

35:08.189 --> 35:10.357
Must you do this to believe me?

35:14.403 --> 35:17.280
Don't grab my heart so hard.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.842
When I drank Hyo-sung's blood...

35:37.176 --> 35:38.718
the blisters disappeared.

35:39.595 --> 35:41.930
It's as ifthe vampire cells
suppressed EV.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.851
But, it doesn't last very long.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.020
Father...

35:49.856 --> 35:52.649
I didn't choose the blood
that was transfused into me!

35:53.943 --> 35:56.236
You know I went
there to do good!

36:01.868 --> 36:04.619
Now, I thirst after
all sinful pleasures.

36:05.746 --> 36:09.541
But how can I get human
blood without killing!

36:10.209 --> 36:11.168
First...

36:12.044 --> 36:15.005
The Lord said not to worry
about what to eat.

36:15.464 --> 36:17.632
For He feeds even
whe birds in the sky.

36:18.301 --> 36:19.259
Here.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.155
I think I won.

36:41.365 --> 36:43.658
Small four winds!

36:44.285 --> 36:46.536
Closed, halfflush,
bonus 3 points!

36:47.872 --> 36:49.831
30 bucks! You lose!

36:52.960 --> 36:56.546
Some priest.
From Macao or something?

36:56.881 --> 37:02.344
He's the only one
who survived out of 500.

37:02.553 --> 37:04.262
500, yeah right.

37:41.467 --> 37:42.842
When did you go out?

37:43.761 --> 37:45.637
I didn't see you.

38:34.895 --> 38:38.648
It's ah...
kind of an infectious disease.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.109
Scary, isn't it?

38:42.028 --> 38:45.030
How different...
without his glasses.

38:47.783 --> 38:49.451
How can you get infected?

38:51.787 --> 38:54.456
Not through a kiss for sure.

38:54.957 --> 38:57.751
I never kissed
anyone in my life.

39:02.298 --> 39:03.381
Until now.

39:32.244 --> 39:34.662
I don't get shy.

39:36.665 --> 39:38.750
I didn't run out cuz I'm shy.

39:40.086 --> 39:42.962
Back in Busan...

39:44.256 --> 39:46.424
It's cuz I was
sick of everything.

39:51.764 --> 39:56.351
The mom, idiot son,
and the dark, damp house.

39:56.852 --> 39:59.562
The non-stop weepy, old songs.

40:06.695 --> 40:08.738
I waited for you to come.

40:09.782 --> 40:11.950
The orphanage boy...

40:14.245 --> 40:15.870
I waited for you...

40:16.872 --> 40:18.373
when I was young...

40:20.584 --> 40:22.544
cuz the idiot liked you.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.839
When you came,
he left me alone.

40:33.681 --> 40:36.015
I'm not a shy person.

40:49.905 --> 40:51.865
I run out on my bare feet...

40:52.783 --> 40:55.743
to escape from
this hell sooner.

41:05.254 --> 41:07.297
I even run out from my sleep.

41:07.756 --> 41:09.841
They think its sleepwalking.

41:10.259 --> 41:14.471
I feel awake only then
and asleep the rest ofthe time.

42:37.429 --> 42:38.638
Honey!

42:40.349 --> 42:41.391
Tae-ju!

42:41.684 --> 42:42.725
Hot water bag!

42:43.978 --> 42:44.936
Tae-ju?

42:47.147 --> 42:48.398
Tae-ju!

43:21.765 --> 43:23.057
You bitch!

43:23.684 --> 43:25.768
There she goes again.

43:25.769 --> 43:27.645
I fed you and raised you!

43:27.688 --> 43:30.440
Go put her to bed!

43:31.442 --> 43:34.652
You can't even change
your husband's hot water bag?

43:34.695 --> 43:37.864
How dare you!

43:38.282 --> 43:39.324
I win.

43:39.617 --> 43:40.658
Let go!

43:46.165 --> 43:49.834
Stomach troubles?
What took you so long?

43:49.877 --> 43:52.420
Eat up other's money
and you'll get diarrhea.

44:02.598 --> 44:03.514
What's got into you?

44:05.476 --> 44:07.060
This looks fun.

44:08.187 --> 44:10.146
So exciting to touch.

44:12.483 --> 44:14.317
I could do it all night, too.

44:14.360 --> 44:15.943
You don't even know
how to do it.

44:17.237 --> 44:18.321
Me?

44:19.448 --> 44:21.032
I know how to do it.

44:22.159 --> 44:23.326
I'm good.

44:25.788 --> 44:28.498
They are on fire!

44:29.541 --> 44:33.044
I can't wait till next Wednesday.

44:33.087 --> 44:35.338
Then how about Sundays, too?

44:36.715 --> 44:37.757
Why not?

44:38.967 --> 44:39.967
Well...

44:42.179 --> 44:44.972
It's Easter Sunday
I'm staying at the hospital.

44:45.974 --> 44:48.935
It's best to leave things
in wanting.

44:50.771 --> 44:52.313
Did you touch her?

44:53.524 --> 44:55.650
I kissed her and held her.

44:57.986 --> 44:59.237
Undress her?

45:03.075 --> 45:04.951
Not completely.

45:06.161 --> 45:09.163
The Good Book says to
cut offthe hand that sins.. .

45:10.290 --> 45:13.167
but no matter how many times I do.. .
I can't control my heart.

45:14.795 --> 45:15.753
Mom...

45:18.799 --> 45:19.757
I...

45:21.969 --> 45:24.595
can't live like this anymore.

45:26.056 --> 45:27.306
I...

45:29.351 --> 45:32.603
I want to help the needy.

45:36.567 --> 45:40.027
Maybe I can volunteer
at a hospital or something.

45:43.449 --> 45:44.532
On Sundays.

45:48.787 --> 45:50.621
Sin of heart is okay.

45:51.206 --> 45:55.209
That is a common sin
so it can be easily forgiven.

45:55.961 --> 46:00.506
But you must not taint your body with sin.

46:00.549 --> 46:03.050
Once you fall, there's no stopping it.

46:03.469 --> 46:06.345
Keep cutting and cutting.

46:07.055 --> 46:11.601
Cut away anything and everything,
to keep your body from sins.

46:15.981 --> 46:26.240
Holding her is like being in the water.

46:27.534 --> 46:29.619
Almost doesn't feel like a body.

46:33.081 --> 46:35.416
Anyway, I cannot believe it's a sin.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.422
Thank you for coming.

46:42.633 --> 46:44.258
Don't come again.

46:45.469 --> 46:48.346
But I came to help the needy.

46:51.183 --> 46:54.435
Its a bigger sin for a priest.

46:55.479 --> 46:57.772
I'm not Catholic.

46:59.107 --> 47:01.859
To me, you're just a needy,
single man.

47:02.653 --> 47:06.405
We can both go to hell for this.

47:07.157 --> 47:09.617
I don't have faith
Im not going to hell.

47:15.082 --> 47:16.249
But I...

47:19.378 --> 47:21.963
I have a terrible disease.

47:22.005 --> 47:24.549
I'm too damn healthy.

47:25.801 --> 47:28.553
Just once,
I wish I could be sick in bed.

47:55.581 --> 47:56.873
It's okay.

47:58.292 --> 48:02.336
Hyo-sung's in a coma.

48:03.922 --> 48:08.134
Unless his vitals drop
no one will come in here at nights.

49:52.739 --> 49:55.449
Sorry, I hurt you.

49:58.996 --> 50:02.331
No, its good.

50:04.084 --> 50:05.710
Its strange, but good.

50:09.464 --> 50:12.842
Is it supposed to
feel this good?

50:48.503 --> 50:49.920
What's wrong with me?

50:52.758 --> 50:54.717
Are other women like this?

50:57.262 --> 51:00.514
Am I a pervert?

54:39.401 --> 54:40.943
Did you eat?

54:41.695 --> 54:43.862
Ah, yes.

54:45.782 --> 54:48.450
Can we meet
during the day next week?

54:49.869 --> 54:51.453
Daytimes a bit...

54:52.956 --> 54:54.915
We could be together longer.

54:58.586 --> 55:01.839
I don't want to keep my disease
a secret from you.

55:03.300 --> 55:04.925
I am...

55:07.470 --> 55:10.764
a kind of a...

56:00.398 --> 56:02.941
I don't kill anyone you know.

56:03.485 --> 56:05.110
Hyo-sung...

56:05.945 --> 56:08.822
He loved helping the hungry.

56:10.075 --> 56:13.369
He'd offer me his blood,
if he wasn't in a coma.

56:14.579 --> 56:17.748
If you only heard
the sponge cake story.

56:18.875 --> 56:22.669
No one blames someone
for getting hurt in an accident!

56:23.588 --> 56:26.215
No one gets criticized
for having cancer!

56:29.469 --> 56:31.845
I went there to do good!

56:40.563 --> 56:42.731
So what if I'm a vampire?

56:44.692 --> 56:47.945
Did you like me cuz I'm a priest?

56:48.696 --> 56:51.865
Its not that, is it?
That's just myjob.

56:51.866 --> 56:53.659
Being a vampire is
like having different palates...

56:53.701 --> 57:00.207
or different biorhythms
don't you think?

57:00.959 --> 57:04.128
When two people are in love,
does it really matter?

57:05.255 --> 57:06.839
No, what I mean is...

57:08.967 --> 57:10.634
You hate that I'm a vampire?

57:11.261 --> 57:14.471
Think I could've slept
with you if I wasn't?

57:14.472 --> 57:16.932
How could I have sex with you?

57:17.267 --> 57:18.934
As just a priest?

57:22.272 --> 57:23.564
Come with me.

57:23.606 --> 57:25.649
I'll take you away from this hell.

57:29.487 --> 57:32.573
You liked doing it with me
Kang-woo's no fun.

57:38.872 --> 57:39.913
Tae-ju?

57:48.256 --> 57:49.548
What's going on?

57:52.969 --> 57:54.636
The toilet's not flushing.

58:07.650 --> 58:09.193
It's going down now.

58:27.504 --> 58:28.545
Closing time.

59:19.264 --> 59:20.389
Hello?

59:20.431 --> 59:21.848
How can...

59:23.268 --> 59:25.143
someone become a vampire?

59:28.064 --> 59:30.566
Can you catch it through sex?

59:36.155 --> 59:38.657
Can you turn me into one?

01:00:20.575 --> 01:00:25.412
Vampires are...
cuter than I thought.

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:34.338
Can you bend this?

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:37.132
What for?

01:00:56.944 --> 01:00:58.320
Can you jump down from here?

01:01:10.249 --> 01:01:12.042
Too high?

01:01:50.289 --> 01:01:51.540
I'm ready.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.213
Did Kang-woo do that?

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:43.592
Does he hurt you often?

01:02:47.472 --> 01:02:49.139
Not often...

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:55.228
Want me to rip him up
like that coin?

01:03:07.158 --> 01:03:12.621
I lived as their dog
my whole life...

01:03:14.081 --> 01:03:19.628
feeding the idiot, washing him
and even helping him masturbate.

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.756
You know...

01:03:24.175 --> 01:03:26.426
I'm practically a virgin.

01:03:28.262 --> 01:03:29.137
He's...

01:03:30.389 --> 01:03:37.854
Such an idiot, he won't take his medicines
unless I take them first.

01:03:39.774 --> 01:03:46.696
I don't know how I can still be alive
after all the weird medicines I took.

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:59.042
That idiot doesn't like
me doing volunteer work.

01:04:00.378 --> 01:04:02.712
I'll kill them both,
Kang-woo and his mother!

01:04:20.064 --> 01:04:24.442
We don't have much time.
Hold me, now.

01:04:29.365 --> 01:04:32.033
Does it hurt?

01:04:42.086 --> 01:04:45.881
Can't you volunteer
somewhere else?

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.592
Mental hospitals are so scary.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.518
Drink it.

01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:07.944
Can't you go back to the lab?

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:13.241
Ask ifthere's any way
for a cure?

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:18.079
Sunlight is bound to hit me
on my way there.

01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:20.415
Sunlight...

01:05:22.251 --> 01:05:27.213
I wish I can see the sunrise
over the sea before I die.

01:05:29.634 --> 01:05:31.968
What are you thinking!

01:05:33.387 --> 01:05:35.639
Vampires can't see the sunlight!

01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:38.808
I don't care if it's at night.

01:05:39.894 --> 01:05:45.231
The moon, the stars
and even a firefly...

01:05:46.901 --> 01:05:48.735
Be the miracle worker!

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:51.446
Make the blind see!

01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:55.617
Give me the vampire blood!

01:05:56.077 --> 01:05:58.703
It even killed EV!

01:05:59.163 --> 01:06:00.538
Please, Sang-hyun!

01:06:00.539 --> 01:06:03.333
Come here!

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:07.545
Sang-hyun! Father Hyun!

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:10.548
Please!

01:06:11.092 --> 01:06:13.259
Just a little bit, please?

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:19.057
I'm no longer
a priest nor a friar.

01:06:21.185 --> 01:06:23.979
Forget the rules!
Forget the Vatican!

01:06:24.855 --> 01:06:26.523
I'm leaving!

01:06:30.361 --> 01:06:33.029
Father Hyun! Father Hyun!

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:39.619
I don't know
why you wandered astray.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:44.958
But I know you'll get through this.

01:06:46.293 --> 01:06:50.714
I took pity on you
when you were young.

01:06:52.383 --> 01:06:55.260
We had you over for noodles.

01:06:57.179 --> 01:07:01.725
You can stay here
as long as you want.

01:07:02.476 --> 01:07:03.435
Thank you.

01:07:07.648 --> 01:07:09.524
Tae-ju...

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:16.823
She's really good at heart.

01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:24.622
I'm giving the shop
and everything to her.

01:07:27.752 --> 01:07:29.919
Did I do it too hard?

01:07:35.259 --> 01:07:36.718
It's perfect.

01:07:41.265 --> 01:07:43.141
One more time, then?

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:53.443
Why do I always get mixed up
with the freaks?

01:07:54.487 --> 01:07:59.908
One does it once every 5 years
and the other, 5 times a day.. .

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:17.050
Did you think about what I said?

01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:24.640
Let's say I run away with you, Father.

01:08:24.683 --> 01:08:27.060
Told you I'm not a priest anymore!

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:35.652
You can sleep during the day.
There are many people who live like that.

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:38.738
Poets, writers, they all work at night.

01:08:39.573 --> 01:08:45.411
Or, pretend you've been in New York till now,
and haven't got used to the time difference.

01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:48.622
I'll take care of everything at night.

01:08:50.835 --> 01:08:56.714
I feel like I can do anything.
I could drive a night cab.

01:08:58.591 --> 01:09:01.719
And suck the blood off customers
when you get hungry?

01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:04.555
Why would I run away with a cab driver?

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:08.184
When this house will eventually be mine.

01:09:30.957 --> 01:09:32.542
Good night.

01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:34.002
Sweet dreams.

01:10:52.873 --> 01:10:54.249
Get out! Go!

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:58.086
Hurry!

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:03.007
Go! Someone will see you!

01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:13.268
No! Don't!

01:11:32.746 --> 01:11:38.918
? The seagulls flying
in the distance...

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:45.008
? I called, but no response.

01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:50.555
? O, my hometown by the waters
where bright blue stars glisten...

01:11:50.597 --> 01:11:56.853
? in my dreams full of sorrow.

01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:00.898
Remember Tae-ju
when she was young?

01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:04.360
Wasn't she cute?

01:12:05.279 --> 01:12:07.530
When she was 12

01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:10.450
she woke me up
and showed me her panties.

01:12:11.285 --> 01:12:12.535
Said she peed blood.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:18.458
Cuz mom worked her day
and night with needlework.

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:22.045
We cried together all night.

01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:29.552
Planning on taking all night?

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:34.432
It's only 9 o'clock.

01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:39.520
The hospital and police questioning
will take hours.

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:42.815
What ifthe sun comes up?

01:12:57.414 --> 01:12:58.831
I said, no!

01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:01.834
Just a little bit?

01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:06.047
They'll find out with an autopsy!

01:13:08.467 --> 01:13:12.011
Why go somewhere else
for blood?

01:13:12.679 --> 01:13:14.555
We have blood right here.

01:13:16.767 --> 01:13:18.351
Put the knife down.

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:20.728
Yeah, put it down.

01:13:25.484 --> 01:13:27.944
No! Don't come near me!

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:11.047
It's not too late...
If I pull him out now, he'll live.

01:15:12.591 --> 01:15:14.967
Tell me now!
You really want him dead?

01:15:16.803 --> 01:15:20.556
Ifwe do this, it'll make us happy?

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:24.810
For sure.

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:29.023
Really?

01:15:32.569 --> 01:15:35.029
Of course, silly.

01:15:56.677 --> 01:16:01.389
One female. Unconscious.
Well be going soon.

01:16:18.699 --> 01:16:24.412
Don't mention
that I let you fish here.

01:16:25.372 --> 01:16:28.124
I'll take care of everything.

01:16:29.042 --> 01:16:32.545
Such a terrible thing, this.. .

01:16:52.357 --> 01:16:56.944
Hey, what are you doing?

01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:03.909
Accidents happen in the blink of an eye, eh?

01:17:04.328 --> 01:17:07.330
You need the body to close the case.

01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:09.332
You can go home now.

01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:10.499
Can it be so hard to find?

01:17:10.584 --> 01:17:12.418
We'll call you ifwe find him.

01:17:13.587 --> 01:17:16.756
Even ifwe can't,
he'll eventually float up

01:17:17.174 --> 01:17:22.511
It's a lake. He can't go anywhere.
You need to see a dermatologist.

01:17:26.099 --> 01:17:27.058
Wait!

01:17:29.102 --> 01:17:33.314
You'll be fined for fishing in a
restricted area.

01:17:34.941 --> 01:17:35.941
Yes.

01:18:00.467 --> 01:18:03.678
Father Hyun... Father...

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:06.847
He became ill again for our sins!

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:12.395
Grant me the following

01:18:12.437 --> 01:18:15.523
in the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ.

01:18:16.066 --> 01:18:20.736
Like a leper rotting in flesh,
let all avoid me.

01:18:21.279 --> 01:18:24.407
Like a cripple without limbs

01:18:24.449 --> 01:18:27.243
let me not move freely.

01:18:27.869 --> 01:18:29.745
Remove my cheeks

01:18:29.788 --> 01:18:32.748
that tears may
not roll down them.

01:18:35.085 --> 01:18:37.253
There was a house
at the bottom ofthe lake.

01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:39.255
A submerged village.

01:18:40.424 --> 01:18:43.592
I thought he was dead.

01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:48.139
But when I went up
he'd float up, too.

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:50.766
So I put him in a closet
in the house

01:18:50.767 --> 01:18:53.436
and a big rock on his chest.

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:58.149
What if he comes out
and chases me?

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:03.529
I should've put a rock
at the closet door, too.

01:19:04.781 --> 01:19:07.158
Death is the end. Right Father?

01:19:08.368 --> 01:19:09.326
When you're dead, you're dead?

01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:25.050
See?

01:19:27.345 --> 01:19:29.930
Vampires are not immortal.

01:19:31.808 --> 01:19:33.350
You still want my blood?

01:19:36.813 --> 01:19:40.775
You want to see
this dark world that badly?

01:19:42.986 --> 01:19:45.237
You live on other's blood

01:19:45.989 --> 01:19:48.115
but won't give me
a drop of yours!

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.499
Give me absolution and
I'll give it to you.

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:06.842
God the Father of mercies,
has reconciled the world to himself

01:20:07.552 --> 01:20:11.138
through the death
and resurrection of his Son...

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:15.142
and sent the Holy Spirit among us
for the forgiveness of sins;

01:20:15.894 --> 01:20:19.605
through the ministry ofthe Church
may God give you
pardon and peace.. .

01:20:20.148 --> 01:20:23.859
and I absolve you from your sins
in the name ofthe Father...

01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:25.861
and ofthe Son
and ofthe Holy Spirit.

01:20:25.862 --> 01:20:26.862
Amen.

01:20:27.781 --> 01:20:30.241
Let us praise the Lord.

01:20:34.871 --> 01:20:38.123
The Lord's mercy endures forever.

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:44.880
The Lord has forgiven your sins.

01:21:51.489 --> 01:21:54.742
Living as a vampire is like.. .

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:56.076
Well, in one word.. .

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:00.331
I feel like I've been chosen.

01:22:00.957 --> 01:22:04.793
'I wasn't neglected, after all.'

01:22:09.174 --> 01:22:14.053
I feel like I've been given
a special role in this life.

01:22:21.102 --> 01:22:22.436
What role?

01:22:23.104 --> 01:22:24.355
I've no idea.

01:22:25.398 --> 01:22:27.232
Maybe to love a married woman.

01:22:27.984 --> 01:22:29.151
I've no idea.

01:22:31.655 --> 01:22:40.788
If I live truthfully as a vampire,
maybe I'll find out some day.

01:23:07.565 --> 01:23:09.024
Please.

01:23:12.153 --> 01:23:15.239
In the name ofthe Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:17.157
Amen.

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:23.706
I pray to Tae-ju.

01:23:24.457 --> 01:23:27.543
Please wake up
and listen to my prayer.

01:23:30.088 --> 01:23:33.841
I said Kang-woo was drunk
from a bottle of So-ju.

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:36.969
So say the same to the cops.

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:40.806
When this is all over
we will be together.

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:43.726
We must not meet for a while.

01:23:45.979 --> 01:23:50.232
Though my face may seem
cold and rigid...

01:23:50.275 --> 01:23:52.443
my heart only beats for you.

01:23:53.737 --> 01:23:58.907
When we meet again
I believe we'll finally be happy.

01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:03.829
ln the name ofthe Father, the Son
ln the name ofthe Father, the Son

01:24:16.092 --> 01:24:17.051
Father?

01:24:17.927 --> 01:24:19.636
Doing it this way...

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:24.224
feels like Ill live on inside you.

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:16.735
Stop all the...

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:18.070
thinking, longing.

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:24.618
The police needs the body
to close the case.

01:25:26.746 --> 01:25:34.253
Kang-woo couldn't swim, Mrs. Ra
You gotta move on with your life.

01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:36.713
Kang-woo can swim.

01:25:44.597 --> 01:25:46.932
Father Hyun's still not
taking calls?

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.268
It must've been a big shock.

01:25:53.273 --> 01:25:55.607
Still, he could've come
to the funeral.

01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:05.826
Kang-woo!

01:26:10.456 --> 01:26:12.332
I'm Sang-hyun, Ma'am.

01:26:12.375 --> 01:26:13.834
I know I'm all wet but...

01:26:14.294 --> 01:26:15.460
My poor baby.

01:26:16.296 --> 01:26:17.921
What took you so long?

01:26:17.964 --> 01:26:19.756
Why didn't you call?

01:26:20.884 --> 01:26:24.178
Bastard! You son of a bitch!

01:26:26.764 --> 01:26:28.515
- Mrs. Ra!
- Mrs. Ra!

01:26:28.558 --> 01:26:30.142
Wake up Mrs. Ra!

01:26:32.562 --> 01:26:35.814
Drink this, Mrs. Ra!

01:26:39.944 --> 01:26:43.822
This is why we should all watch
our blood pressures.

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:46.241
Watch our drinking.

01:26:46.784 --> 01:26:48.744
And stay away from salty foods.

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:58.253
Let's give Mrs. Ra
our positive energy, Oasis-style.

01:26:58.796 --> 01:27:01.340
Starting with Tae-ju.

01:27:03.843 --> 01:27:05.010
Mom...

01:27:05.929 --> 01:27:09.264
How long's it been?

01:27:51.975 --> 01:27:53.433
Why are you so wet?

01:27:53.851 --> 01:27:54.851
What?

01:27:58.481 --> 01:27:59.564
Is there a leak?

01:28:02.568 --> 01:28:03.944
Whys it so damp?

01:28:09.367 --> 01:28:11.827
Come here and
stop imagining things.

01:28:18.668 --> 01:28:21.128
It's all psychological.

01:28:23.381 --> 01:28:25.757
Stop making a fuss
and will you come here?

01:29:21.856 --> 01:29:23.357
Was he here, too?

01:29:28.571 --> 01:29:29.529
He? Who?

01:29:32.408 --> 01:29:37.746
? Seagulls flying
in the distance...

01:30:48.693 --> 01:30:49.734
Don't fall for it.

01:30:50.486 --> 01:30:52.028
It's all just an illusion.

01:30:52.488 --> 01:30:55.740
It's just psychological.

01:31:37.074 --> 01:31:38.200
How's that?

01:31:45.166 --> 01:31:47.542
You look pretty.. .

01:32:00.765 --> 01:32:02.307
Hello?

01:32:03.768 --> 01:32:08.313
A lie detector?

01:32:28.084 --> 01:32:31.836
Take this for now.. .

01:32:35.132 --> 01:32:41.012
What's this for...?

01:32:41.681 --> 01:32:44.015
She's visiting her parents...

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:51.398
It's not easy for a woman to be alone.. .

01:32:53.859 --> 01:32:58.029
with your body getting all hot, yeah?

01:33:35.901 --> 01:33:36.943
You're going?

01:33:40.948 --> 01:33:44.409
How can someone do it
five times, straight?

01:34:38.172 --> 01:34:41.966
Mom never once
threw me a birthday party.

01:34:50.768 --> 01:34:51.851
How dare you!

01:35:09.787 --> 01:35:14.165
But she always gave me
plenty to eat.

01:35:15.876 --> 01:35:16.960
Then thank her.

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:20.839
Thank you.

01:35:26.262 --> 01:35:30.598
Can't you go to that detective?

01:35:30.683 --> 01:35:32.225
Aren't you thirsty these days?

01:35:37.565 --> 01:35:39.858
I'll throw you
a birthday party this year.

01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:44.320
Really?

01:35:44.363 --> 01:35:46.448
The first birthday party
in my life?

01:35:48.075 --> 01:35:52.871
But...I don't know
when my birthday is.

01:36:07.261 --> 01:36:09.345
But who made you boss?

01:36:10.473 --> 01:36:11.765
Telling me this and that

01:36:11.807 --> 01:36:12.932
and hitting me around.

01:36:14.477 --> 01:36:17.437
Kang-woo never laid
a hand on me.

01:37:03.984 --> 01:37:05.109
Did Kang-woo...

01:37:06.153 --> 01:37:07.695
beat you or not?

01:37:09.448 --> 01:37:11.115
Why does that matter?

01:37:13.285 --> 01:37:14.869
That's why he died!

01:37:15.871 --> 01:37:17.330
Don't make excuses!

01:37:18.374 --> 01:37:20.416
You would've killed him anyway.

01:37:21.001 --> 01:37:24.629
So you can have me for yourself.

01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:28.550
Do you know how hard
I tried not to kill people?

01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:33.513
You can't even begin to imagine!

01:37:35.891 --> 01:37:39.018
A blood thirsty beast
is growling inside me!

01:37:40.062 --> 01:37:43.147
But I tiptoed around
afraid to hurt anyone.

01:37:46.277 --> 01:37:47.944
I killed him cuz of you.

01:37:50.906 --> 01:37:51.865
To save you.

01:37:55.369 --> 01:37:57.245
To save me?

01:38:00.583 --> 01:38:02.709
Then why am I living
a nightmare?

01:38:04.670 --> 01:38:08.423
I stay up trembling
at the thought of

01:38:08.465 --> 01:38:11.718
your cold hand touching me.

01:38:12.344 --> 01:38:13.595
How did this happen?

01:38:21.478 --> 01:38:26.441
Mom!

01:38:27.651 --> 01:38:29.444
I'm done for.

01:38:29.486 --> 01:38:31.362
He's going to kill me.

01:38:32.072 --> 01:38:33.865
Poor Kang-woo...

01:38:34.575 --> 01:38:37.744
My poor, dear mom...

01:38:38.746 --> 01:38:42.957
You treated that devil like a son
and this is what you get?

01:38:44.752 --> 01:38:46.210
Did I do it alone?

01:38:47.463 --> 01:38:49.047
It was your idea.

01:38:55.262 --> 01:38:58.139
No! It was his idea!

01:38:58.182 --> 01:39:00.141
He said he'll kill
the mother and son!

01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:02.810
Honest!

01:39:36.011 --> 01:39:39.263
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

01:39:41.183 --> 01:39:44.435
We were a happy family ofthree
till you infested us!

01:39:44.770 --> 01:39:46.062
You're a germ!

01:39:51.819 --> 01:39:54.821
You said I was cute, you cunt!

01:40:07.584 --> 01:40:09.711
Mommy, mommy...

01:40:10.671 --> 01:40:12.255
Look at me.

01:40:13.590 --> 01:40:15.633
You can't die like this.

01:40:17.094 --> 01:40:18.052
Mom.

01:40:21.724 --> 01:40:24.600
Tell me you forgive me.

01:40:25.269 --> 01:40:26.310
Mom...

01:40:26.729 --> 01:40:28.146
Look at me.

01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:32.734
If you forgive me blink once.

01:40:32.735 --> 01:40:35.528
Just one blink? Please?

01:40:38.741 --> 01:40:41.743
Just once? Please?

01:40:51.503 --> 01:40:52.462
Let's go!

01:40:52.755 --> 01:40:55.798
That devil will suck
all the blood out of you, too!

01:41:00.763 --> 01:41:05.058
Let go!

01:41:12.107 --> 01:41:14.650
Stay back you devil!

01:41:23.786 --> 01:41:25.369
I want to go to Kang-woo.

01:41:26.121 --> 01:41:27.413
Kill me, please.

01:41:27.915 --> 01:41:29.332
You want to go?

01:41:32.461 --> 01:41:34.253
Go to your husband?

01:41:40.844 --> 01:41:41.552
Really?

01:46:24.503 --> 01:46:26.712
Happy birthday, Tae-ju.

01:46:46.983 --> 01:46:48.943
The sun's down already?

01:46:59.496 --> 01:47:03.707
Completely white
just like daylight.

01:48:10.775 --> 01:48:15.029
That's a good girl.

01:48:15.655 --> 01:48:21.952
From now on, we wear shoes
inside the house like in the States.

01:48:21.953 --> 01:48:23.954
Cuz I'm in charge, now.

01:48:25.499 --> 01:48:29.126
You have to
sleep during the day, too.

01:48:29.878 --> 01:48:31.212
And eat at night...

01:48:33.882 --> 01:48:34.840
Did you just move?

01:48:43.475 --> 01:48:45.726
Watch TV while I'm out.

01:48:49.689 --> 01:48:51.815
A scary movies gonna be on.

01:48:54.361 --> 01:48:56.028
You shouldn't look at this.

01:48:59.491 --> 01:49:00.824
Do you love Tae-ju Park?

01:49:04.788 --> 01:49:06.038
Of course not.

01:49:08.708 --> 01:49:12.670
I heard the priest came by
all too often to the house.. .

01:49:14.339 --> 01:49:16.131
what is your relationship with him?

01:49:20.428 --> 01:49:23.389
I didn't like the priest
from the beginning.

01:49:30.272 --> 01:49:31.855
Take a cab home.

01:49:31.856 --> 01:49:33.857
They'll suspect us
ifwe leave together.

01:49:43.368 --> 01:49:49.540
Should it matter which route I take?
I'll get there in time.. .

01:49:49.583 --> 01:49:53.043
I just wondered whereabouts you are.

01:49:53.044 --> 01:49:59.216
I'm going up the hill on the highway.. .

01:49:59.259 --> 01:50:02.052
Why did you want to see so urgently?

01:50:02.053 --> 01:50:05.306
- It's about the polygraph test earlier.. .
- Yeah.

01:50:05.348 --> 01:50:07.850
I just remembered something else.

01:50:07.892 --> 01:50:09.059
You did?

01:50:10.604 --> 01:50:12.563
It's about Father Hyun.. .

01:52:08.763 --> 01:52:10.514
I'm not ashamed at all!

01:52:11.975 --> 01:52:12.933
I told you!

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:14.518
Ill get the blood!

01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:16.854
Stealing from the hospital?

01:52:16.896 --> 01:52:18.605
- There's more.
- What?

01:52:18.690 --> 01:52:20.941
I'm helping people
who want to commit suicide.

01:52:20.984 --> 01:52:23.861
I know many people like that
from listening to confessions.

01:52:24.446 --> 01:52:27.614
If I run out, I'll find more
through the Internet.

01:52:28.783 --> 01:52:34.580
They face death more peacefully
if I help them.

01:52:39.335 --> 01:52:41.503
Iftheyjust give it to you,
what fun is that?

01:52:51.181 --> 01:52:52.848
It tastes much better this way.

01:52:53.808 --> 01:52:55.851
How many has to die
for your taste?

01:52:56.644 --> 01:53:02.149
Maybe around 500?
How's that, Father?

01:53:02.817 --> 01:53:04.610
I told you
I'm not a Father anymore!

01:53:05.278 --> 01:53:08.947
Oh dear, the Father is mad.

01:53:10.074 --> 01:53:13.744
Stop acting so humane!
You're not even human.

01:53:15.789 --> 01:53:16.955
Then what are we?

01:53:16.956 --> 01:53:19.249
We're human-eating beasts
that's what!

01:53:26.466 --> 01:53:28.509
Is it a sin for a fox
to eat a chicken?

01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:56.328
Don't make me regret
saving you.

01:53:57.789 --> 01:54:02.417
Kill me or save me
you'll regret either way.

01:54:03.002 --> 01:54:04.419
We're through!

01:54:15.890 --> 01:54:21.520
I dump him
and he drops me like this?

01:54:30.989 --> 01:54:33.323
You're the only one
I've got, now.

01:54:51.968 --> 01:54:55.596
Then let me eat what I want.

01:54:57.557 --> 01:54:58.599
No!

01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:03.937
No? Even if I die?

01:56:16.678 --> 01:56:20.263
You said women are
safe from EV.

01:56:21.015 --> 01:56:25.435
Your blood is completely
mixed with mine.

01:56:28.356 --> 01:56:30.440
Then, I'm no longer
a woman?

01:56:41.661 --> 01:56:42.828
Hold on.

01:56:47.667 --> 01:56:48.959
I'll get a doctor.

01:57:26.497 --> 01:57:27.622
Hello?

01:57:30.877 --> 01:57:32.252
How do you feel...

01:58:01.282 --> 01:58:02.157
Tae-ju...

01:58:04.368 --> 01:58:06.078
What day is it today?

01:58:15.379 --> 01:58:18.340
The eyes are so telling.

01:58:18.382 --> 01:58:22.928
They can express everything
between yes and no.

01:58:22.929 --> 01:58:26.139
What good is just a yes or no?

01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:30.352
You need a subject and verb
to communicate.

01:58:32.855 --> 01:58:37.067
The subject is
what's being stared at.

01:58:37.777 --> 01:58:40.612
If you stare at something
for over 4 seconds...

01:58:40.947 --> 01:58:44.699
others will automatically
turn to look, too.

01:58:45.576 --> 01:58:46.910
Is that a published theory?

01:58:49.372 --> 01:58:50.914
Haven't had the chance yet.

01:58:52.834 --> 01:58:56.711
I'm an expert at reading the eyes
after 2 years of marriage

01:58:57.964 --> 01:58:59.548
That's why her Korean's
not improving.

01:58:59.590 --> 01:59:02.425
Can you tell
what mom's saying?

01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:04.010
That's what I'm talking about!

01:59:04.595 --> 01:59:08.265
Tae-ju just saw me
peek over at Mrs. Ra.

01:59:08.975 --> 01:59:13.145
She knew what I was going to say,
before I said it.

01:59:13.646 --> 01:59:15.438
By glancing at my eyes.

01:59:17.733 --> 01:59:23.238
Mrs. Ra said I'd win
if I took this piece.

01:59:23.281 --> 01:59:26.241
And that she wants
some Vodka.

01:59:26.284 --> 01:59:27.325
Vodka!

01:59:29.954 --> 01:59:31.538
I win!

01:59:31.873 --> 01:59:33.915
Closed, Self-draw,
bonus 3 points,

01:59:33.958 --> 01:59:35.000
Big three dragons!

01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:38.461
See that?

01:59:39.755 --> 01:59:42.632
Thank you, Mrs. Ra.

01:59:45.219 --> 01:59:47.137
You want to play that bad?

01:59:49.182 --> 01:59:52.642
How about teaming her up
with Evelyn?

01:59:53.644 --> 01:59:57.898
If you blink it means 'yes'.

01:59:58.566 --> 02:00:01.651
A long blink means 'no'.

02:00:02.278 --> 02:00:03.528
Okay?

02:00:03.571 --> 02:00:06.740
Blink if you understand.

02:00:18.211 --> 02:00:19.461
Throw it away.

02:00:20.046 --> 02:00:21.713
Mrs. Ra is back!

02:00:22.256 --> 02:00:24.716
Evelyn? Vodka.

02:00:42.068 --> 02:00:43.109
'D'.

02:00:43.778 --> 02:00:47.113
'D', what?

02:00:47.865 --> 02:00:49.824
You can move
your finger, mom?

02:00:50.868 --> 02:00:52.452
What's wrong with your nail?

02:00:53.371 --> 02:00:59.334
'L' It's another letter!

02:01:00.044 --> 02:01:00.919
What?

02:01:01.128 --> 02:01:04.714
'L, D'.

02:01:05.466 --> 02:01:06.716
Or 'D, L'?

02:01:06.759 --> 02:01:09.552
'D' comes last, 'LD'.

02:01:09.553 --> 02:01:11.429
Maybe she wants the 'LCD' on?

02:01:11.764 --> 02:01:14.099
There's probably
a 'C' somewhere.

02:01:14.141 --> 02:01:16.643
'C'...

02:01:33.577 --> 02:01:34.536
Found it!

02:01:40.459 --> 02:01:42.460
- 'K'!
- 'K'?

02:01:43.963 --> 02:01:45.463
L. D. K?

02:01:54.056 --> 02:01:57.851
Ladies Delaying,
Killing the game.

02:01:59.395 --> 02:02:02.022
'D' comes last! 'KLD'!

02:02:02.023 --> 02:02:04.107
Mrs. Ra, it's 'DKL', right?

02:02:07.862 --> 02:02:09.821
She says, no.

02:02:09.864 --> 02:02:13.908
'KLD'? 'KILLED'?

02:02:15.578 --> 02:02:16.619
I'm right?

02:02:18.664 --> 02:02:21.833
See? It's 'KILLED'!

02:02:23.878 --> 02:02:25.754
Whatever, let's keep
the game alive.

02:02:27.173 --> 02:02:31.926
- Whose turn is it?
- Killed who?

02:02:47.485 --> 02:02:50.111
Mahjong brings back
memories of Kang-woo?

02:02:51.405 --> 02:02:54.449
Mom... it's not your fault.

02:02:54.867 --> 02:02:56.826
He didn't die cuz of you.

02:02:57.244 --> 02:02:59.454
Stop playing and go to bed.

02:03:02.083 --> 02:03:03.750
Tae-ju's so strong.

02:03:12.134 --> 02:03:15.220
Stop torturing yourself

02:03:15.221 --> 02:03:17.097
Look at me, Mrs. Ra.

02:03:17.556 --> 02:03:19.849
It was an accident.

02:03:19.850 --> 02:03:21.935
No one killed Kang-woo.

02:03:54.385 --> 02:03:57.846
It's not like Tae-ju
and Sang-hyun killed...

02:05:20.346 --> 02:05:22.555
Selfish humans.

02:05:24.475 --> 02:05:29.938
Bastards coming to play Mahjong
with a grieving family

02:05:35.569 --> 02:05:36.569
What?

02:05:38.155 --> 02:05:40.657
Why you little shit.

02:05:43.869 --> 02:05:49.415
I'm leaving,
cuz shit smells not scares.

02:06:13.148 --> 02:06:16.150
Honey! No!

02:06:28.956 --> 02:06:30.540
Oh, Young-du.

02:06:31.333 --> 02:06:32.750
Young-du!

02:06:58.611 --> 02:06:59.569
Stop it.

02:07:46.533 --> 02:07:49.952
You easy-blood drinking coward.

02:08:31.787 --> 02:08:35.331
It's cuz he's dead
and the heart stopped pumping.

02:08:38.377 --> 02:08:40.420
Cut offthe ankles and...

02:08:41.046 --> 02:08:47.427
hang them over the bathtub
and let gravity do the rest.

02:08:49.054 --> 02:08:52.515
We can put the blood in tupperware
and keep it in the fridge

02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:59.021
I thought of using a motor pump
but this works best.

02:09:00.190 --> 02:09:02.775
Sucking a little
and throwing the body away is

02:09:05.696 --> 02:09:07.530
treating life too lightly, isn't it?

02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:27.842
Evelyn...

02:09:30.971 --> 02:09:36.601
How could I have made
all those Kimbaps without you?

02:09:37.811 --> 02:09:39.437
It's over now.

02:09:41.273 --> 02:09:42.523
Happy?

02:09:56.079 --> 02:09:57.413
Tae-ju.

02:09:57.456 --> 02:09:59.749
Listen to me carefully.

02:10:03.086 --> 02:10:04.629
Why do I have to run away?

02:10:09.092 --> 02:10:10.343
From my own house?

02:10:10.385 --> 02:10:14.263
Wont they search the house
when they find the 4 people missing?

02:10:25.234 --> 02:10:29.070
While they search around the house,

02:10:29.112 --> 02:10:32.615
ifthey open the wardrobe
and the curtains in daylight,

02:10:32.658 --> 02:10:35.243
then we'll die?

02:10:39.456 --> 02:10:41.123
What are you doing?

02:10:46.547 --> 02:10:48.714
You already had your fill.

02:11:22.291 --> 02:11:23.541
They'll barge into the house

02:11:24.751 --> 02:11:29.714
without dusting offtheir shoes.. .

02:11:32.885 --> 02:11:43.227
What will happen to the house?

02:11:54.281 --> 02:11:55.615
Where are you going?

02:11:56.992 --> 02:11:58.451
The sun's coming up!

02:13:16.071 --> 02:13:18.614
Didn't you have your fill
from Evelyn?

02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:27.248
Won't you ever answer me?

02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:01.201
I wanted to live
with you forever and ever.

02:21:04.956 --> 02:21:06.748
Together again in hell then.

02:21:10.670 --> 02:21:14.047
When you're dead, you're dead.

02:21:16.342 --> 02:21:20.053
It's been fun, Father.
