11:03.537 --> 11:05.665
<i>who says</i>
<i>it's wrong to eat meat.</i>

11:05.748 --> 11:07.291
<i>Is he crazy?</i>

11:07.375 --> 11:09.502
<i>No, just ignorant.</i>

11:09.585 --> 11:10.961
<i>You see,</i>
<i>your crazy friend</i>

11:11.045 --> 11:12.296
<i>never heard</i>
<i>of the "food chain".</i>

11:13.964 --> 11:15.549
<i>Just ask this scientician.</i>

11:15.633 --> 11:16.759
<i>Um...</i>

11:16.842 --> 11:18.803
<i>He'll tell you that in nature</i>

11:18.886 --> 11:21.263
<i>one creature invariably</i>
<i>eats another to survive.</i>

11:21.347 --> 11:23.265
<i>(roaring)</i>

11:23.349 --> 11:25.017
<i>(eagle screeches,</i>
<i>sheep bleats)</i>

11:25.101 --> 11:26.018
<i>(growls)</i>

11:28.062 --> 11:29.563
<i>Don't kid yourself, Jimmy.</i>

11:29.647 --> 11:31.107
<i>If a cow ever got</i>
<i>the chance</i>

11:31.190 --> 11:32.900
<i>he'd eat you and</i>
<i>everyone you care about.</i>

11:37.279 --> 11:41.325
<i>Wow, Mr. McClure,</i>
<i>I was a grade-A moron</i>

11:41.409 --> 11:43.077
<i>to ever question eating meat.</i>

11:43.160 --> 11:46.038
<i>Yes, you were, Jimmy.</i>

11:46.122 --> 11:47.748
<i>Yes, you were.</i>

11:47.832 --> 11:49.834
<i>Ow. You're hurting me.</i>

11:49.917 --> 11:52.461
<i>(mooing)</i>

11:52.545 --> 11:55.673
They can't seriously expect us
to swallow that tripe.

11:55.756 --> 11:58.551
Now, as a special treat courtesy
of our friends at the Meat Council,

11:58.634 --> 12:00.219
please help yourselves
to this tripe.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.054
(cheering)

12:04.056 --> 12:06.016
Stop it!
Stop it!

12:06.100 --> 12:07.101
Don't you realize
you've just been brainwashed

12:07.184 --> 12:08.936
by corporate propaganda?

12:09.019 --> 12:13.107
Apparently my crazy friend here
hasn't heard of the food chain.

12:13.190 --> 12:16.527
Yeah, Lisa's
a grade-A moron.

12:16.610 --> 12:20.072
When I grow up, I'm going
to Bovine University.

12:24.326 --> 12:25.661
Hi, Homer.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.496
Thanks for inviting me
to your barbecue.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.458
Wow, Barney, you brought
a whole beer keg.

12:30.541 --> 12:31.876
Yeah, where can
I fill it up?

13:05.868 --> 13:07.286
Wait, Dad.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.413
Good news, everyone.
You don't have to eat meat.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.665
I made enough gazpacho for all.

13:11.749 --> 13:12.958
(all murmuring)

13:13.042 --> 13:14.335
What is that anyway?

13:14.418 --> 13:17.505
It's tomato soup
served ice cold.

13:17.588 --> 13:21.634
(laughing)

13:21.717 --> 13:22.968
BARNEY: Go back to Russia.

13:33.604 --> 13:37.483
Ah, diagnosis: Delicious.

13:37.566 --> 13:39.693
I've got the prescription
for you, doctor.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.112
Another hot beef
injection.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.405
(laughing)

13:45.366 --> 13:48.494
Hey, Homer, wing me another
one of them, uh...

13:48.577 --> 13:50.663
burgers, would you?

13:50.746 --> 13:54.375
Can't quite seem to... stand up
under my own power anymore.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.252
One whopper for the copper.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.088
Can I have a burger, Dad?

13:59.171 --> 14:00.631
Here you go!

14:00.714 --> 14:02.967
It's bad enough
they're all eating meat.

14:03.050 --> 14:05.469
They don't have
to rub it in my face.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.763
Ah!

14:10.057 --> 14:11.517
Okay, everybody,

14:11.600 --> 14:13.727
it's the moment
you've all been waiting for...

14:13.811 --> 14:16.438
the pig de resistance.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.773
ALL: Ooh!

14:17.857 --> 14:19.233
Ah!

14:19.316 --> 14:21.193
(laughing)

14:21.277 --> 14:22.236
Look at his nose.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.571
Congratulations, Homer.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.739
Your Q's a huge success.

14:25.823 --> 14:29.076
A toast to the host who
can boast the most roast.

14:29.159 --> 14:31.161
(chuckles)
Thanks, Flanders.

14:31.245 --> 14:34.790
I have to agree
that everything certainly--

14:34.874 --> 14:35.916
Huh?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.084
(gasping)

14:37.167 --> 14:39.295
Bart, no!

14:39.378 --> 14:40.296
What?

14:40.379 --> 14:41.589
Sorry. Force of habit.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.716
Lisa, no!

14:46.844 --> 14:48.137
Ah! Oh!

14:55.519 --> 14:56.770
(groaning)

14:58.105 --> 14:59.356
It's just a little dirty.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.524
It's still good.
It's still good.

15:00.608 --> 15:01.650
(honking)

15:04.904 --> 15:06.155
It's just a little slimy.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.573
It's still good.
It's still good.

15:18.584 --> 15:19.835
It's just
a little airborne.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.170
It's still good.
It's still good.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.671
-It's gone.
-I know.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.924
You know, Smithers,
I think I'll donate

15:25.007 --> 15:28.385
a million dollars
to the local orphanage...

15:28.469 --> 15:29.595
when pigs fly.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.388
(both laughing)

15:31.472 --> 15:32.556
That's a good one.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.769
Will you be donating that
million dollars now, sir?

15:36.852 --> 15:38.979
No, I'd still prefer not.

15:45.235 --> 15:47.529
Give it up, Dad--
Piggy ain't coming back.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.575
Lisa, you ruined
my barbecue.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.911
I demand you apologize
this second.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.704
I'm never ever apologizing

15:55.788 --> 15:57.539
because I was standing up
for a just cause

15:57.623 --> 15:59.708
and you were wrong,
wrong, wrong!

15:59.792 --> 16:02.670
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to my room.

16:02.753 --> 16:03.921
That's it!
Go to your room!

16:05.547 --> 16:08.842
Marge, since I'm not
talking to Lisa,

16:08.926 --> 16:11.512
would you please ask her
to pass me the syrup?

16:11.595 --> 16:14.223
Please pass your father
the syrup, Lisa.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.892
Bart, tell Dad I'll
only pass the syrup

16:16.976 --> 16:19.728
if it won't be used
on any meat product.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.188
You dunking your sausages
in that syrup, homeboy?

16:21.271 --> 16:23.524
Marge, tell Bart
I just want to drink

16:23.607 --> 16:25.693
a nice glass of syrup
like I do every morning.

16:25.776 --> 16:26.860
Tell him yourself.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.737
You're ignoring Lisa,
not Bart.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.739
Bart, thank your mother
for pointing that out.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.533
Homer, you're not
not talking to me

16:32.616 --> 16:34.326
and secondly, I heard
what you said.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.453
Lisa, tell your mother
to get off my case.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.330
Dad, Lisa's the one
you're not talking to.

16:38.414 --> 16:39.665
Bart, go to your room.

16:39.748 --> 16:41.291
Why don't you
just eat him, Dad?

16:41.375 --> 16:44.336
I don't need any serving
suggestions from you

16:44.420 --> 16:46.338
you barbecue-wrecking,
know-nothing know-it-all.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.631
That's it!

16:47.715 --> 16:49.550
I can't live in a house

16:49.633 --> 16:51.260
with this
prehistoric carnivore!

16:51.343 --> 16:53.137
I am out of here!

16:56.348 --> 16:57.808
That's it!
Go to your room!

16:59.893 --> 17:01.854
Look, it's Mrs. Potato head.

17:01.937 --> 17:04.273
She has a head
made out of lettuce.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.066
(both laughing)

17:06.150 --> 17:08.527
I can't believe I used
to go out with you.

17:08.610 --> 17:10.654
Are you gonna marry
a carrot, Lisa?

17:10.738 --> 17:13.991
Yes, I'm gonna
marry a carrot.

17:14.074 --> 17:15.409
She admitted it.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.369
She admitted she's gonna
marry a carrot.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.038
I can't believe it.

17:35.721 --> 17:36.722
<i>...your windows.</i>

17:36.805 --> 17:38.724
<i>Mmm! The next--</i>

17:43.187 --> 17:45.022
The whole world wants me
to eat meat.

17:45.105 --> 17:46.648
I can't fight it anymore.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.198
(gasping)

17:59.119 --> 18:00.245
(gulps)

18:00.329 --> 18:02.831
There!
Is everybody happy now?!

18:02.915 --> 18:05.667
I take it from you're yelling
that you like my tofu dogs.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.669
-Tofu?
-Oh, yes.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.004
No meat whatsoever,

18:09.088 --> 18:11.006
and only thrice the fat
of a normal hot dog.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.300
I made the switch
and nobody noticed.

18:13.383 --> 18:14.510
But why, Apu?

18:14.593 --> 18:16.053
Because I'm a vegetarian.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.013
Haven't you ever seen
my T-shirt?

18:20.265 --> 18:21.725
That's cute.

18:21.809 --> 18:24.019
Here, let me show you
something, Lisa.

18:27.981 --> 18:30.359
Wow. A secret staircase.

18:30.442 --> 18:33.195
But what do you do if somebody
wants a non-alcoholic beer?

18:33.278 --> 18:34.196
You know,
it's never come up.

18:40.994 --> 18:43.288
LISA:
Oh, Apu, it's beautiful.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.957
Yes, this is where I come

18:45.040 --> 18:46.583
when I need some refuge
from the modern world

18:46.667 --> 18:50.504
or when I want to see
drive-in movies for free.

18:50.587 --> 18:53.382
I know it is not easy to be
a vegetarian, Lisa.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.050
That's why I ran away
from home.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.718
What? She's leaving home?

18:58.470 --> 19:00.597
Wow. Paul McCartney.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.599
I read about you
in history class

19:02.683 --> 19:03.934
but where's your wife,
Linda?

19:04.017 --> 19:05.227
Right here, Lisa.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.937
Whenever we're in Springfield,

19:07.020 --> 19:08.981
we like to hang out in Apu's
garden in the shade.

19:09.064 --> 19:10.899
We met him in India years ago,

19:10.983 --> 19:12.359
during the Maharishi days.

19:12.442 --> 19:15.028
Back then, I was
known as the fifth Beatle.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.530
Sure you were, Apu.

19:16.613 --> 19:17.656
You know what, Lisa?

19:17.739 --> 19:19.908
Paul and Linda
are vegetarians too.

19:19.992 --> 19:23.287
In fact, Linda has her own
line of vegetarian entrees.

19:23.370 --> 19:26.123
Apu, I'm sure the last thing
they want to talk about is--

19:26.206 --> 19:27.416
We weren't satisfied
with the other

19:27.499 --> 19:29.168
vegetarian meals
on the market.

19:29.251 --> 19:30.627
You'd be surprised how often

19:30.711 --> 19:32.629
you'd find a big hunk
of pork in them.

19:32.713 --> 19:33.672
Ew.

19:33.755 --> 19:34.798
Linda and I both
feel strongly

19:34.882 --> 19:36.508
about animal rights.

19:36.592 --> 19:39.720
In fact, if you play
"Maybe I'm Amazed" backwards,

19:39.803 --> 19:40.804
you'll hear a recipe

19:40.888 --> 19:42.723
for a really ripping
lentil soup.

19:42.806 --> 19:44.474
When will
all those fools learn

19:44.558 --> 19:46.185
that you can be
perfectly healthy

19:46.268 --> 19:49.271
simply eating vegetables,
fruits, grains, and cheese?

19:49.354 --> 19:50.981
Ooh! Cheese.

19:51.064 --> 19:53.025
You don't eat cheese, Apu?

19:53.108 --> 19:56.862
No, I don't eat any food
that comes from an animal.

19:56.945 --> 20:00.490
Oh, then you must
think I'm a monster.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.201
Yes, indeed,
I do think that.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.453
But I learned long ago, Lisa,

20:04.536 --> 20:05.746
to tolerate others

20:05.829 --> 20:07.581
rather than forcing
my beliefs on them.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.041
You know, you can
influence people

20:09.124 --> 20:10.542
without badgering them
always.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.378
It's like Paul's song,
"Live and Let Live."

20:13.462 --> 20:15.047
Actually, it was
"Live and Let Die."

20:15.130 --> 20:17.299
Whatever, whatever,
it had a good rhythm.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.635
I guess I have been pretty hard
on a lot of people,

20:19.718 --> 20:21.720
especially my dad.

20:21.803 --> 20:22.763
Thanks, you guys.

20:22.846 --> 20:24.389
Lisa, before you go,

20:24.473 --> 20:25.807
would you
like to hear a song?

20:25.891 --> 20:27.559
Wow! That'd be great!

20:27.643 --> 20:30.562
Okay. Take it, Apu.

20:48.830 --> 20:51.166
Lisa! Come back before
everyone finds out

20:51.250 --> 20:52.960
what a horrible father I am.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.170
Hi, Dad. Looking for me?

20:55.254 --> 20:56.880
I don't know.
Are you looking for me?

20:56.964 --> 20:58.465
I don't know.

20:58.548 --> 21:01.426
Oh, Lisa...
I was looking for you.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.428
I wanted to apologize.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.305
I don't know exactly
what went wrong

21:05.389 --> 21:06.890
but I know
it's always my fault.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.433
Actually, Dad, this time,
I was wrong...

21:08.517 --> 21:09.434
(gasps)

21:09.518 --> 21:11.186
-Too.
-Oh.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.604
While I was gone, I got
some really good advice

21:12.688 --> 21:14.106
from Paul
and Linda McCartney.

21:14.189 --> 21:17.442
Rock stars-- Is there
anything they don't know?

21:17.526 --> 21:19.695
I still stand
by my beliefs

21:19.778 --> 21:22.239
but I can't defend
what I did.

21:22.322 --> 21:24.700
I'm sorry
I messed up your barbecue.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.785
I understand, honey.

21:26.868 --> 21:29.121
I used to believe in things
when I was a kid.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.333
Come on, I'll give you
a piggyback ride--

21:33.417 --> 21:35.711
Whoops, I mean
a veggie-back ride home.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.129
Come on.
