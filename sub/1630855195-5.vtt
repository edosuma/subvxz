WEBVTT

00:07.206 --> 00:08.172
Everything that went down

00:08.241 --> 00:09.413
in Bali Keys is my fault.

00:09.482 --> 00:10.724
Skipper, there's
a boat following us.

00:10.793 --> 00:11.655
Even at full throttle,
we can't outrun them.

00:11.724 --> 00:13.000
There's an opening!

00:13.068 --> 00:14.896
Shit,
I don't think we're gonna fit.

00:16.344 --> 00:17.896
Everybody down.
Guys, stay quiet.

00:17.965 --> 00:20.206
Where is Denny's
fucking place?

00:21.413 --> 00:23.379
A weak fucking hypocrite.

00:23.448 --> 00:25.000
Joe, you're right.
I am weak.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.655
Pack your shit up.
Get off my boat.

00:26.724 --> 00:28.275
Someone has to tell Lana
that there are certain things

00:28.344 --> 00:30.000
you can't outrun.

00:30.068 --> 00:31.448
To prove to you
that I'm on your side,

00:31.517 --> 00:34.551
I'm not gonna show this photo
to the Australian police.

00:34.620 --> 00:36.724
Why am I the only one
who keeps having these--

00:36.793 --> 00:38.931
these nightmares
about what we did?

00:42.724 --> 00:44.689
We could be heading
right into a tropical storm.

00:44.758 --> 00:46.034
What choice do I have,
wait here

00:46.103 --> 00:48.103
for them to come back
and slit our throats?

00:49.275 --> 00:51.000
Gotta stem the flood.

00:51.068 --> 00:52.448
Give him the signal.

01:01.793 --> 01:02.965
I couldn't stop it.

01:03.034 --> 01:04.103
I'm sorry.

01:18.034 --> 01:19.586
Well done.

01:19.655 --> 01:21.172
I didn't know you could cook.

01:53.758 --> 01:55.482
Kitty, confess.

01:55.551 --> 01:57.068

- Confess!

02:58.103 --> 02:59.310
You OK?

02:59.379 --> 03:01.137
Mm-hmm.

03:01.206 --> 03:02.724
Yeah, I'm fine.

03:12.137 --> 03:13.241
You sure?

03:13.310 --> 03:14.413
Mm.

03:24.310 --> 03:26.931
- One sec.
- Shell!

03:28.758 --> 03:31.275
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

03:31.344 --> 03:34.034
I'm--I gotta--

03:34.103 --> 03:36.000
Shell, I was--

03:36.068 --> 03:37.103
I'm sorry, Shell.

03:37.172 --> 03:38.758
For what?

03:38.827 --> 03:42.241
This bad shit,
it's all my fault.

03:42.310 --> 03:45.448
I--I--you know, I deserve it.
You don't, Shell.

03:45.517 --> 03:46.862
You're a good person.

03:46.931 --> 03:48.689
- How'd he get like this?
- You are a good person.

03:48.758 --> 03:50.793
Well, we--
we were celebrating.

03:50.862 --> 03:53.241
Celebrating what?

03:55.275 --> 03:57.034
- Oh.
- Just being alive.

03:57.103 --> 03:58.965
Whilst you're on watch?

03:59.034 --> 04:02.137
Go. Go, go, go, go.
All right. All right.

04:02.206 --> 04:03.517
Hey.

04:03.586 --> 04:04.862
Heinrich, wake up.

04:04.931 --> 04:06.413
Denny.

04:08.275 --> 04:10.068
Denny.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.931
Hey.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.068
I'm gonna take that.

04:15.137 --> 04:16.379
Do you want some water?

04:16.448 --> 04:17.586
You OK?
Oh.

04:17.655 --> 04:20.172
- Do you want to get up?
- Helen.

04:20.241 --> 04:21.517
Helen, baby.

04:21.586 --> 04:23.413
Oh, come on.
Come on.

04:25.965 --> 04:27.862
I should have just
gotten you a cat

04:27.931 --> 04:29.896
because you always
wanted a fucking cat--

04:29.965 --> 04:31.310
Hey, whoa, whoa.

04:31.379 --> 04:32.965
Hey, hey, hey.

04:33.034 --> 04:35.413
Kitty--Kitty, I'm--
Kitty, I'm sorry.

04:35.482 --> 04:37.862
Come on.
All right, taxi for one.

04:37.931 --> 04:39.275
Come on.

04:39.344 --> 04:40.482
Where are we going?

04:40.551 --> 04:41.413
We're going to bed.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.689
Oh.

04:52.206 --> 04:54.965
Hey! Yeah.

05:14.068 --> 05:15.068
Come on.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.103
And again.

05:37.344 --> 05:39.448
What's he on about?

05:39.517 --> 05:40.965
What does that mean?

05:42.655 --> 05:44.620
That we're fucked, Lana.

05:44.689 --> 05:46.275
Four knots.

05:46.344 --> 05:47.517
Is that good?

05:47.586 --> 05:48.517
No wind.

05:48.586 --> 05:49.896
We can't sail.

05:51.689 --> 05:55.172
Because...
karma stole our wind.

05:55.241 --> 05:57.655
Just stop it
with the karma bullshit

05:57.724 --> 05:59.965
that Joe was banging on
about, please.

06:00.034 --> 06:01.241
No.

06:01.310 --> 06:03.413
No, Kitty.

06:03.482 --> 06:05.448
It wants us.

06:05.517 --> 06:06.655
You're cursed.

06:08.620 --> 06:11.310
This is the curse, is it?

06:11.379 --> 06:13.310
What the hell?

06:13.379 --> 06:15.724
It's for my knee.

06:15.793 --> 06:18.724
And Aaron has a bad knee,
too, does he?

06:18.793 --> 06:20.068
How much did Aaron have?

06:21.724 --> 06:24.275
We're way off course.

06:24.344 --> 06:26.689
What the hell was he doing?

06:26.758 --> 06:28.241
We're being chased, Shell.

06:28.310 --> 06:31.551
He--he wanted to put them
off the scent.

06:31.620 --> 06:35.827
But using most of the fuel
going in the wrong direction.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.413
What the fuck, Aaron?

06:37.482 --> 06:38.758
He got us away, didn't he?

06:38.827 --> 06:40.620
Away from where?

06:40.689 --> 06:42.172
How are we supposed
to get to Palau now?

06:42.241 --> 06:44.931
We're stranded 200 miles
from any land.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.620
We'll use the last
of the fuel to find some wind.

06:52.103 --> 06:53.448
It's too risky.

06:53.517 --> 06:56.620
We could be left out here,
stranded with nothing.

06:58.551 --> 06:59.896
We should wait for the wind,

06:59.965 --> 07:01.586
and it'll give us some time
to check the patch.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.827
Wait to get caught?

07:03.896 --> 07:05.896
That's a bad idea.

07:07.586 --> 07:09.793
All our ideas are bad.

07:12.931 --> 07:14.896
That's what
we're doing, Denny.

07:14.965 --> 07:16.827
If Aaron wakes up
and decides to do

07:16.896 --> 07:19.724
something different, fine.

07:19.793 --> 07:23.103
Until then,
we're doing it my way.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.586
Fine...

07:33.655 --> 07:35.000
Captain.

07:45.482 --> 07:47.172
No more horse tranquilizer.

07:48.689 --> 07:51.413
Hey.
Hey, I need that.

09:17.206 --> 09:18.482
Right.

09:19.965 --> 09:22.724
Oh, I--I know the water

09:22.793 --> 09:24.000
and food supplies
are running low,

09:24.068 --> 09:26.344
but could you check,
see exactly how low?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.517
Confess, Kitty.

09:37.586 --> 09:40.275
Kitty, confess!

10:18.620 --> 10:20.931
How's the patch looking?

10:21.000 --> 10:23.793
It's not pretty,
but it should hold.

10:27.689 --> 10:29.241
Denny, what are we doing?

10:30.827 --> 10:32.620
What do you mean?

10:32.689 --> 10:34.206
I thought we had a plan.

10:34.275 --> 10:35.689
We do.

10:35.758 --> 10:37.344
I'm just worried about Aaron.

10:38.551 --> 10:39.517
This is not good.

10:39.586 --> 10:40.620
He's just drunk.

10:40.689 --> 10:41.655
He'll be fine.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.241
He's an addict, Lana.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.103
Trust me.

10:46.172 --> 10:49.344
When he falls off the wagon,
things get very bad very fast.

10:49.413 --> 10:51.931
That's all the more reason
to get away from him.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.482
When we get to Palau,
and we sell the diamonds--

10:54.551 --> 10:56.172
I mean, he treats you
like shit, anyway.

11:02.965 --> 11:06.413
He's still my brother.

11:06.482 --> 11:08.551
I owe him.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.068
You understand, don't you?

11:16.448 --> 11:17.551
Is she OK?

11:19.965 --> 11:22.000
I don't know.

11:22.068 --> 11:23.689
You can ask her yourself.

11:46.586 --> 11:48.724
It's a bit early.

11:48.793 --> 11:49.965
Never too early.

11:53.931 --> 11:55.862
Is everything OK?

11:59.275 --> 12:01.620
I won't tell Shell
if you don't.

12:07.965 --> 12:09.862
I think we're both
on Lana's shit list.

12:09.931 --> 12:11.034
Mm.

12:19.310 --> 12:21.931
What, do you want me to
apologize for voting you off?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.931
No, hey, it's fine.

12:27.379 --> 12:28.931
No hard feelings.

12:36.793 --> 12:39.172
Since we're...

12:39.241 --> 12:41.620
already in trouble--hold that.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.620
bit more than that.

12:57.689 --> 12:58.689
Just for starters.

13:34.793 --> 13:36.620
Hello?

14:09.034 --> 14:10.620
Don't scream.

14:12.241 --> 14:14.586
After Palau,

14:14.655 --> 14:16.551
after what happened...

14:19.724 --> 14:22.068
We decided to head
straight home.

14:27.517 --> 14:29.931
But the terrorists
must have been tracking us

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
all the way
from the Philippines.

14:37.517 --> 14:39.827
By the time
we spotted them, we--

14:39.896 --> 14:42.000
We couldn't outrun them.

14:48.689 --> 14:51.034
And...

14:51.103 --> 14:53.000
you know, Aaron...

14:58.965 --> 15:01.655
Well, he told everyone to hide
while he got the tender ready.

15:01.724 --> 15:04.482
But they slit his throat before
he could get there, so...

15:09.655 --> 15:12.448
Then they searched the boat
and found the others.

15:17.586 --> 15:20.241
I mean, I was
a fucking coward, Lana.

15:20.310 --> 15:22.413
I stayed hidden,
even when I heard the shots.

15:22.482 --> 15:25.551
And I knew they must
all be dead.

15:25.620 --> 15:28.379
I just...hid.

15:28.448 --> 15:31.448
They had so many guns.

15:31.517 --> 15:32.724
I just--

15:37.655 --> 15:39.724
And then when I came up,
the...

15:39.793 --> 15:42.103
boat was empty.

15:47.689 --> 15:52.379
All the bodies
were in the water, and...

15:52.448 --> 15:55.655
there was blood on the deck,
in the cabin.

15:58.310 --> 16:00.862
And I just
gunned it of there.

16:03.103 --> 16:05.068
'Cause--

16:08.724 --> 16:10.448
I don't know.

16:10.517 --> 16:12.344
I just took the tender
in case they came back.

16:15.344 --> 16:18.448
Fuck.
Keeps going round in my head.

16:20.724 --> 16:23.275
Should I have
done something or--

16:25.793 --> 16:29.517
I don't know.
There were too many of them.

16:35.793 --> 16:38.896
I'm sorry, Lana.

16:38.965 --> 16:41.620
I'm sorry I couldn't save her.

16:57.862 --> 17:00.620
I--

17:00.689 --> 17:03.241
I think I need--
I think I need to go.

17:03.310 --> 17:04.724
I think--

17:10.137 --> 17:11.517
- No, no.
- Wait. Wait.

17:11.586 --> 17:13.068
You need to stay here.

17:13.137 --> 17:16.206
Look, I just need to talk
to her real quick, OK?

17:16.275 --> 17:17.724
She's upset.

17:17.793 --> 17:18.965
Please.

17:23.068 --> 17:24.827
Hey, wait.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.310
Here she is. Here she is.

17:39.586 --> 17:41.551
Are you connected
to the boat?

17:41.620 --> 17:43.310
What happened to the rest?

17:43.379 --> 17:45.482
Are you the only survivor?

17:45.551 --> 17:47.793
Can I just get one quote?

17:47.862 --> 17:49.000
Miss! Miss!

17:50.344 --> 17:52.586
Hey, Lana.

17:52.655 --> 17:54.965
Lana.

17:55.034 --> 17:58.379
It's all right.
Just--just breathe, yeah?

17:58.448 --> 18:00.172
It's OK, all right?

18:00.241 --> 18:03.724
Just--come on.

18:03.793 --> 18:05.517
Just put--put your hands
on the ground.

18:07.413 --> 18:09.344
Just feel the ground.

18:09.413 --> 18:10.862
That's it.

18:10.931 --> 18:12.793
Just feel the ground.

18:12.862 --> 18:13.931
Oh.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.310
Shh, it's OK.

18:15.379 --> 18:17.482
Breathe in.
Breathe in.

18:17.551 --> 18:19.482
Come on.
It's OK.

18:19.551 --> 18:22.275
It's OK.

18:22.344 --> 18:25.448
Oh, Joseph, he was--
he was right.

18:25.517 --> 18:27.862
He was right.

18:30.724 --> 18:32.551
What?

18:34.275 --> 18:36.103
How did you get here?

18:36.172 --> 18:38.620
After Shell dropped me off
at the village,

18:38.689 --> 18:41.827
I swung back over,
and I hid here in the store.

18:41.896 --> 18:43.620
- You're a fucking nut.
- Hey, hey.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.551
You can't tell them I'm here.
Yeah, I can. I have to.

18:45.620 --> 18:47.896
They'll fucking kill me.

18:47.965 --> 18:50.000
Aaron, he's a psychopath.

18:50.068 --> 18:52.896
If you tell him I'm here...

18:52.965 --> 18:54.068
I'm dead.

18:54.137 --> 18:55.724
Don't be stupid.

18:55.793 --> 18:58.241
He's not gonna hurt you.
Are you sure about that?

19:15.758 --> 19:17.310
OK, there's no one here.

19:17.379 --> 19:19.379
You're gonna have
to hide in my cabin.

19:21.068 --> 19:23.310
Come on.

19:29.413 --> 19:31.413
Come on.
Quick, quick, quick.

19:46.379 --> 19:48.965
Whoo!

19:49.034 --> 19:51.241

19:56.862 --> 19:59.034

Hey--

20:21.206 --> 20:22.931
What are you doing?

20:23.000 --> 20:26.793
You know, I couldn't convince
them to rig the sails, but...

20:26.862 --> 20:29.517
maybe they'll listen
to you, Captain.

20:34.620 --> 20:36.689
For God's sakes, Kitty.

20:36.758 --> 20:38.344
Oh, come on.

20:38.413 --> 20:40.448
Gimme it.

20:40.517 --> 20:42.724
Gimme it.

20:42.793 --> 20:44.034
Go on.

20:44.103 --> 20:46.103
- Kitty, stop this.
- Whoo!

20:46.172 --> 20:48.172
Come on.

20:48.241 --> 20:52.310
Come on, all work, no play
makes you so neggy.

20:52.379 --> 20:53.965
Come on, Shell.

20:54.034 --> 20:56.103
Join in.
Captain.

20:56.172 --> 20:57.862
Captain.

20:57.931 --> 21:00.586

- Whoo!

21:00.655 --> 21:02.931
Come on, Shell.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.551
We've got nothing else to do
now we're stranded.

22:08.206 --> 22:10.517
- Ah!
- Hey!

22:43.137 --> 22:44.551
Yeah!

22:51.793 --> 22:53.620
There's no way that you're
gonna make it to Palau

22:53.689 --> 22:55.206
without Aaron seeing you.

22:55.275 --> 22:57.379
I'm really sorry to put you
in this position.

22:57.448 --> 22:59.137
What did you think
was gonna happen?

23:02.103 --> 23:04.172
Maybe I wasn't
really thinking.

23:07.551 --> 23:08.793
Why are you actually here?

23:08.862 --> 23:10.724
I came back for you.

23:13.551 --> 23:15.620
I'm sorry.

23:15.689 --> 23:17.862
I was--I was worried about you.

23:17.931 --> 23:20.517
You're just not safe
with these people.

23:20.586 --> 23:23.137
What are you talking about?

23:23.206 --> 23:26.068
They don't care about
anyone but themselves.

23:27.206 --> 23:29.482
But you're different.

23:29.551 --> 23:31.758
You're a good person.

23:33.241 --> 23:36.482
Where did you get that idea?

23:36.551 --> 23:39.379
The tragedy is,
you can't even see it.

23:47.448 --> 23:49.172
I shouldn't have come here.

23:54.241 --> 23:58.827
I know I have no right
to ask you to help me.

24:01.275 --> 24:02.896
But you're helping me
right now,

24:02.965 --> 24:05.034
which shows
that I was right about you.

24:09.103 --> 24:10.551
Whoo! Whoo!

25:13.620 --> 25:15.310
Hey.

25:15.379 --> 25:17.034
Hey.

25:17.103 --> 25:18.172
You OK?

25:21.103 --> 25:23.206
Yeah, I'm fucking great.

25:36.206 --> 25:38.034
Hello.

25:53.724 --> 25:55.068
How about you?

25:55.137 --> 25:57.689
Oh, no.

25:57.758 --> 25:59.655
No.

25:59.724 --> 26:02.413
We shouldn't leave
anyone out.

26:09.448 --> 26:11.827
Oh, yes.

26:13.551 --> 26:16.965
Fucking kiss him.

26:17.034 --> 26:20.344
Oh! With tongues too.
With tongues.

26:20.413 --> 26:22.275
Doesn't mean anything.

26:25.172 --> 26:26.241
OK.

26:26.310 --> 26:29.103
OK.

26:29.172 --> 26:31.000
Oh, there was tongue,
believe me.

26:31.068 --> 26:34.482
Come on. Come on.
Honey.

26:34.551 --> 26:36.448
So what?

26:36.517 --> 26:38.103
Hey.

26:38.172 --> 26:40.551
Yeah?

26:40.620 --> 26:42.655
That needed to happen.

26:47.206 --> 26:49.413
Mm. My bedtime, I think.

26:51.172 --> 26:52.517
Turn the music off.

26:52.586 --> 26:54.896
Aaron's gonna be cranky enough
when he wakes up.

27:38.344 --> 27:39.448
Fuck.

27:41.206 --> 27:43.379
- He's here?
- Yeah. Hide behind the door.

27:43.448 --> 27:45.482
Get behind the door,
quick, quick, quick.

27:49.931 --> 27:55.068
Hey, I think
I need backup up there.

27:55.137 --> 27:57.931
They're all out of control.

27:59.275 --> 28:00.517
Yeah, well, you're an adult,

28:00.586 --> 28:03.241
so I'm sure you
can handle it yourself.

28:05.896 --> 28:08.206
I am sorry about earlier.

28:11.448 --> 28:15.000
I just got a bit
freaked out by Aaron.

28:16.517 --> 28:17.931
Yeah, sure.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.275
It's fine.

28:21.689 --> 28:24.000
It's just, when he needs me,

28:24.068 --> 28:27.862
I don't know if I can just...

28:27.931 --> 28:29.241
leave him, you know?

28:32.758 --> 28:34.448
Come here, you.

28:36.724 --> 28:39.310
I do want to be with you, Lana.

28:41.862 --> 28:44.068
Look, I--

28:54.551 --> 28:55.655
What?

28:55.724 --> 28:57.586
You are still with me,
aren't you?

28:57.655 --> 28:59.344
Yeah.
Yeah.

28:59.413 --> 29:02.517
I know it's complicated,
but I do need to know...

29:04.172 --> 29:05.551
If you still got my back.

29:05.620 --> 29:07.068
Of course.

29:10.206 --> 29:12.586
I just think Aaron's gonna
wake up in a minute,

29:12.655 --> 29:14.137
so I don't think
we should risk anything.

29:14.206 --> 29:15.172
- You're tired?
- Yeah.

29:15.241 --> 29:16.931
- Me too.
- Tired.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.206
Yeah.

29:19.275 --> 29:20.172
OK.

29:20.241 --> 29:22.655
I'm gonna go to bed.

29:22.724 --> 29:24.379
- Good night.
- Night.

29:24.448 --> 29:25.655
Good night.

29:34.068 --> 29:37.172
- Thank you.
- Fuck you.

29:37.241 --> 29:39.172
You cannot stay in here.

29:39.241 --> 29:42.379
Why?
Because of him?

29:42.448 --> 29:44.103
You know you're not the first
girl he's done this to?

29:44.172 --> 29:45.482
Done what?

29:45.551 --> 29:47.275
Well, the charm,
the exciting secrecy.

29:47.344 --> 29:50.137
Then he gets bored of them,
and they disappear.

29:50.206 --> 29:51.448
Well, I'm still here, so--

29:51.517 --> 29:53.551
Yeah, for now.

29:53.620 --> 29:56.586
Just get out of my way.

29:56.655 --> 29:58.068
I should have known.

29:58.137 --> 29:59.586
You're like the rest of them.

29:59.655 --> 30:00.655
Move.

30:03.344 --> 30:04.965
What?

30:09.172 --> 30:11.689
What do you want?

30:39.275 --> 30:41.206
Lana!

30:41.275 --> 30:42.896
Lana.
Lana!

30:42.965 --> 30:43.862
Lana.
Shh.

30:43.931 --> 30:45.241
Please, Lana.

30:47.448 --> 30:50.103
Kitty.

30:50.172 --> 30:51.724
Kitty. Kit.

30:51.793 --> 30:52.793
Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty.

30:54.379 --> 30:57.137
Kitty.

30:57.206 --> 30:59.482
Aaron!

30:59.551 --> 31:01.310
Oh, what the fuck?

31:06.655 --> 31:09.551
Hey, man, what the fuck
are you doing here?

31:09.620 --> 31:12.413
I see you're still a--
you're still a little--

31:12.482 --> 31:14.931
you're her puppy dog, right?

31:15.000 --> 31:17.896
That's nice.

31:17.965 --> 31:20.172
- Hey, Aaron!
- What the fuck?

31:20.241 --> 31:21.482
That's nice.

31:21.551 --> 31:23.103
Whoa.

31:24.482 --> 31:26.310
You should shut your mouth.

31:28.310 --> 31:29.931
I see you've been
spending too much time

31:30.000 --> 31:32.068
with these Neanderthals.

31:32.137 --> 31:33.724
You start to sound like them.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.551
You're a fucking dick,
you know that?

31:36.620 --> 31:38.000
Shell, he's trying
to wind you up.

31:38.068 --> 31:39.482
Hey, Aaron!

32:06.517 --> 32:07.482
Oh.

32:19.344 --> 32:21.689
Where have you been hiding,
Joseph?

32:28.068 --> 32:30.000
With her?

32:30.068 --> 32:31.827
I hid in the galley store.

32:36.448 --> 32:40.620
Why the fuck would you
do something...

32:40.689 --> 32:42.689
like that, Joseph?

32:45.448 --> 32:47.689
I see.
Oh, that's very fucking sweet.

32:47.758 --> 32:51.448
But as you know,
she's fucking my brother.

32:51.517 --> 32:52.862
Mm.

32:57.068 --> 32:59.275
Well...

33:01.724 --> 33:02.827
Aaron.

33:12.517 --> 33:14.448
I want an answer.

33:16.551 --> 33:20.931
I told you to get the fuck
off my boat, hmm?

33:21.000 --> 33:23.172
Why are you still here?

33:28.586 --> 33:29.827
OK.

33:29.896 --> 33:31.655
Aaron, Aaron, Aaron.
Come on. Come on.

33:31.724 --> 33:33.206
Calm down, man.

33:33.275 --> 33:34.344
Just put the gun down, man.

33:34.413 --> 33:36.034
Calm--just calm down.

33:36.103 --> 33:37.275
I'm here
because I'm guilty too.

33:37.344 --> 33:38.758
I agreed to keep the badge.

33:38.827 --> 33:41.586
I am as responsible for
that boy's death as you are.

33:41.655 --> 33:44.241
It will forever stay with me.

33:44.310 --> 33:46.034
It will haunt us.

33:46.103 --> 33:47.241
And that's why I'm here,

33:47.310 --> 33:50.379
because we can't
run away forever.

33:50.448 --> 33:52.068
You must see that.

33:52.137 --> 33:54.103
We--we have to pay.

33:54.172 --> 33:56.310
We've already given
the money and the jewels back.

33:56.379 --> 33:58.137
I don't need money,
stupid Shell!

33:58.206 --> 33:59.931
I'm talking about justice.
Justice?

34:00.000 --> 34:01.448
So when we get to Palau,

34:01.517 --> 34:03.931
we must hand ourselves in
to the authorities,

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
take our punishment.

34:06.068 --> 34:07.689
In prison?

34:07.758 --> 34:09.793
A small price to pay
for true freedom.

34:09.862 --> 34:12.482
Otherwise, you'll always
be running, Aaron.

34:14.517 --> 34:16.241
Sorry, I am not...

34:16.310 --> 34:17.413
No, no, no.
Wait, wait.

34:17.482 --> 34:18.482
Wait, wait, wait.
Going to prison...

34:18.551 --> 34:19.827
Aaron, no, no.
OK, OK, listen.

34:19.896 --> 34:22.310
For you or anybody else
on this fucking boat.

34:22.379 --> 34:24.586
You have the greatest need
for absolution.

34:26.793 --> 34:29.172
The boy who died is not
the first ghost to haunt you.

34:33.689 --> 34:36.724
And what the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

34:38.275 --> 34:39.241
Hmm?

34:39.310 --> 34:40.862
What's her name?

34:43.034 --> 34:44.655
What's her name?

34:47.000 --> 34:48.517
What's her name?

34:49.965 --> 34:51.931
Was it Helen?

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
Aaron!

34:53.068 --> 34:54.482
Hey, hey, hey.
No.

34:54.551 --> 34:56.827
- Aaron, stop!
- Aaron, get off!

34:56.896 --> 34:58.931
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Aaron. Aaron, no.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.689
No!

35:02.862 --> 35:04.310
- Get up!
- Aaron, no, no, no.

35:04.379 --> 35:05.655
- Stop.
- Up!

35:05.724 --> 35:07.551
Aaron!

35:07.620 --> 35:09.000
No.

35:13.862 --> 35:18.103
He stays in there
until Palau.

35:18.172 --> 35:19.862
No, you can't do that.

35:22.103 --> 35:24.206
If anyone...

35:24.275 --> 35:28.379
tries to let the fucker out...

35:28.448 --> 35:31.896
I will shoot them.

35:35.344 --> 35:37.103
- Put the gun down, Aaron.
- Hmm?

35:37.172 --> 35:40.724
Aaron, put it down, OK?

35:40.793 --> 35:42.310
It's OK.

35:45.482 --> 35:47.965
Just walk away, Lana.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.275
Walk away.

35:53.620 --> 35:56.103
I warn you.
Walk away.

35:56.172 --> 35:57.310
No, no.
Lana, don't.

36:02.827 --> 36:06.241
You're all going to jail,
you fuckers!

36:14.793 --> 36:16.344
Fucker!

36:16.413 --> 36:17.758
Don't move!

36:20.310 --> 36:21.275
Hello!

36:21.344 --> 36:23.137
Mayday.

36:25.793 --> 36:27.482
Mayday!

36:41.103 --> 36:42.241
All right, get down.

36:42.310 --> 36:43.827
Get down.

36:55.586 --> 36:58.379
Where's he gone?

36:58.448 --> 37:01.724
That was nice
and fucking stupid.

37:01.793 --> 37:03.551
You can't just
lock people up.

37:03.620 --> 37:05.172
- Now he's got a gun.
- We need to find him.

37:05.241 --> 37:06.758
I'll get some light.

37:09.068 --> 37:10.448
I'll talk to him.

37:10.517 --> 37:11.827
Sure.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.758
If you find him
before Aaron does, yeah.

37:15.034 --> 37:17.344
Come on, mate.

37:17.413 --> 37:19.379
Joseph.

37:21.793 --> 37:24.172
We should sort this out
together.

37:52.758 --> 37:54.172
♪ When the kids
start singing ♪

37:54.241 --> 37:57.068
♪ And the band
begins to play ♪

38:03.724 --> 38:06.172
Kitty? Kitty? Kitty?

38:13.448 --> 38:15.034
Mum?

38:19.344 --> 38:21.793
Kitty.

38:25.034 --> 38:27.206
Are you OK?

38:27.275 --> 38:28.482
What have you taken?

38:28.551 --> 38:30.000
Right.

38:30.068 --> 38:32.379
Kit.

38:32.448 --> 38:33.965
It's me.

38:36.068 --> 38:37.137
I confess.

38:37.206 --> 38:38.517
No.
No, no.

38:38.586 --> 38:40.517
Mm-hmm.
I'm bad.

38:40.586 --> 38:41.586
No.

38:41.655 --> 38:43.241
I'm a bad person.

38:43.310 --> 38:45.206
No, no, Kitty.

38:45.275 --> 38:47.586
Kitty, it's me.
It's me.

38:47.655 --> 38:49.482
You're safe.

38:49.551 --> 38:50.758
I'm gonna look after you.

38:52.275 --> 38:53.793
Lana?

38:53.862 --> 38:56.172
We're gonna get out.
I just need to find Joseph, OK?

38:58.068 --> 38:59.586
It's gonna be OK.

38:59.655 --> 39:02.000
Stay here.
Just don't move.

39:26.896 --> 39:29.827
Hey, Kitty.
Hey, hey, hey.

39:29.896 --> 39:31.827
Kitty, you saw the mother
of that kid.

39:31.896 --> 39:34.310
- No.
- We're all guilty, Kitty.

39:34.379 --> 39:36.310
- No.
- We're murderers.

39:36.379 --> 39:38.379
No.

39:38.448 --> 39:40.172
Confess.

39:41.310 --> 39:43.275
You are.
You're evil.

39:43.344 --> 39:44.310
Confess.

39:47.379 --> 39:48.448
No!

39:55.482 --> 39:56.862
Where is he?

39:56.931 --> 39:58.620
Where did you see him?

39:58.689 --> 40:00.758
- Starboard!
- Where?

40:00.827 --> 40:02.793
- Starboard!
- Joseph!

40:02.862 --> 40:04.344
- Starboard!
- Where's the light?

40:04.413 --> 40:07.206
- Joseph!
- Joseph!

40:07.275 --> 40:08.724
Joseph!
both: Joseph!

40:08.793 --> 40:10.172
Joseph.
Joseph!

40:10.241 --> 40:11.896
- Well, where was he?
- Joe, where are you?

40:11.965 --> 40:14.965
Can you see him?

40:18.206 --> 40:20.655
- Joseph!
- Joseph.

40:20.724 --> 40:23.413
- Joseph.
- Where'd you see him?

40:23.482 --> 40:25.517
- Joseph!
- Joseph!

40:25.586 --> 40:28.000
Joseph!

40:28.068 --> 40:29.551
He's gone under.
The current dragged him down.

40:29.620 --> 40:30.931
Joseph!

40:31.000 --> 40:32.551
Joseph, can you hear us?

40:34.310 --> 40:35.965
Here's the gun.

40:36.034 --> 40:37.862
Did Joseph fire it?
I don't know.

40:37.931 --> 40:39.034
I just saw him in the water,

40:39.103 --> 40:40.482
but I can't see him
anywhere now.

40:40.551 --> 40:43.034
- Joseph!
- Hurry up. Get the flares.

40:43.103 --> 40:44.517
Come on, Heinrich.
Where are the lights?

40:44.586 --> 40:45.724
Joseph!

40:50.379 --> 40:52.068
Denny, get the tender ready.

40:52.137 --> 40:54.241
We can use it to search.
Yeah.

40:55.275 --> 40:56.758
I'm gonna need more light.

40:56.827 --> 40:58.620
Put up a flare or something.

41:00.620 --> 41:02.655
- Aaron.
- What?

41:06.241 --> 41:07.827
Fire the flare.

41:10.586 --> 41:12.000
- Aaron.
- Yes.

41:13.586 --> 41:15.206
I need help here.

41:15.275 --> 41:17.068
OK?

41:17.137 --> 41:18.103
Good.

41:18.172 --> 41:19.620
Joseph!

41:19.689 --> 41:20.896
- Heinrich, hurry up.
- Yeah.

42:33.137 --> 42:36.137
We need to talk
about what happens now.

42:38.931 --> 42:40.793
We need to keep looking.

42:42.931 --> 42:45.724
He wasn't wearing
a life jacket.

42:45.793 --> 42:48.344
He wouldn't--wouldn't
have survived this long.

42:48.413 --> 42:51.172
Well, we should put out
a signal or an alert.

42:51.241 --> 42:53.724
We do that,

42:53.793 --> 42:56.137
we may end up dead or in jail.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.137
Yeah, but we can't
just leave him.

43:06.206 --> 43:08.862
He shouldn't have been here.

43:19.517 --> 43:21.724
Officially, he wasn't.

43:28.896 --> 43:30.827
He wasn't on the manifest.

43:30.896 --> 43:34.896
According to the logbook,
we left him in the Philippines.

43:42.413 --> 43:44.620
We can't just pretend
that he didn't exist.

43:44.689 --> 43:46.172
We've got to do something.

43:48.448 --> 43:50.034
Heinrich?

43:54.379 --> 43:56.275
Shell, come on.

43:58.379 --> 43:59.965
We need to talk
about what happens now.

44:00.034 --> 44:01.344
- No. There should be a vote.
- No.

44:01.413 --> 44:03.517
- We should vote.
- No, fuck voting.

44:03.586 --> 44:05.172
This is a clear call.

44:05.241 --> 44:07.793
This wind might not last,
and we'll be stuck again.

44:14.206 --> 44:16.379
Come on, Aaron.
There must be something.

44:29.758 --> 44:30.896
Listen to Shell.

44:30.965 --> 44:32.310
Use the wind.

44:32.379 --> 44:33.827
No.

44:33.896 --> 44:35.413
No!

44:37.551 --> 44:39.448
It's my boat.

44:39.517 --> 44:41.931
It's my decision.

44:53.517 --> 44:55.758
Put the gun
where I can't find it.

45:11.068 --> 45:12.896
All right,
let's rig the sails.

45:35.896 --> 45:37.689
Come on.

45:45.586 --> 45:47.344
Hey, someone's got
to get around the side there.

45:47.413 --> 45:48.862
Can we get somebody
on the side?

45:50.206 --> 45:51.517
Do you want a drink?

45:51.586 --> 45:53.172
Mm-mm, no.

45:58.034 --> 46:00.241
I'll get you a tea.

46:07.620 --> 46:09.482
Oh, I'm sorry.

46:09.551 --> 46:11.034
No, you don't need
to be sorry.

46:18.551 --> 46:21.620
Hasn't happened
since Mum left.

46:35.655 --> 46:37.137
Thanks.

46:46.103 --> 46:49.310
Why are you being so nice?

46:49.379 --> 46:52.586
You must hate me
after what I did.

46:52.655 --> 46:54.689
Shit happened.

46:54.758 --> 46:56.344
It's in the past.

46:58.137 --> 47:00.344
And I could never hate you...

47:03.172 --> 47:05.379
Even after what you did.

47:07.344 --> 47:09.310
Those fucking diamonds.

47:09.379 --> 47:10.689
Shh.

47:10.758 --> 47:13.103
I'm gonna tell
the police everything.

47:13.172 --> 47:14.586
It might help them catch
whoever did this.

47:14.655 --> 47:15.827
Let's take a minute
here now, OK?

47:15.896 --> 47:17.206
Tell them it was all me.

47:17.275 --> 47:19.241
I don't care
if they lock me up.

47:19.310 --> 47:23.068
We just took a bag.

47:23.137 --> 47:24.724
That's all we did.

47:31.241 --> 47:33.379
I know, Emma.

47:34.689 --> 47:36.172
Kitty told me.

47:43.275 --> 47:46.620
The police asked about her,

47:46.689 --> 47:49.931
about who the fifth person
on "The Blue" was.

47:52.344 --> 47:54.379
But I gave a different name.

47:56.413 --> 47:59.172
They won't find out
what she did back in the UK.

48:08.551 --> 48:10.689
She said she--

48:16.586 --> 48:21.724
She said she wanted you
to be free...

48:21.793 --> 48:24.965
and happy.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Hey.

48:43.068 --> 48:45.413
You OK?

48:45.482 --> 48:47.206
What?

49:02.172 --> 49:05.551
Joseph. Joseph.
Is--

49:09.275 --> 49:10.724
Where's Joseph?

49:17.344 --> 49:19.137
Where's Joseph?
Did he--

49:24.275 --> 49:26.137
Wait.

49:26.206 --> 49:27.758
Wait, what--

49:30.034 --> 49:33.068
What do you remember

49:33.137 --> 49:34.620
about what happened up there?

49:37.103 --> 49:38.586
Did I--

49:43.206 --> 49:44.827
Did I do something?

49:47.344 --> 49:49.448
Kitty--

49:51.103 --> 49:53.896
Denny, tell me.

50:09.068 --> 50:12.310
I mean, it's not the first
time it's happened, right?

50:28.862 --> 50:31.517
Fuck.

50:45.103 --> 50:46.896
Yeah, OK.

50:50.448 --> 50:54.413
Did I...kill Joseph too?

50:56.793 --> 50:58.551
Did I?

51:12.793 --> 51:14.862
Look, I--

51:21.896 --> 51:23.241
Kitty...

51:26.931 --> 51:29.862
I won't tell...

51:29.931 --> 51:31.482
anyone.

51:32.724 --> 51:34.931
Sadly, based
on the new information

51:35.000 --> 51:36.931
we've just received,
we're not expecting

51:37.000 --> 51:38.896
to find any more survivors.

51:38.965 --> 51:40.448
This is--well, it's...

51:40.517 --> 51:41.758
You don't have to talk
to them if you don't want.

51:41.827 --> 51:43.551
Dennis, I would love
a picture, please.

51:45.172 --> 51:46.344
Is this a criminal
investigation?

51:46.413 --> 51:47.758
Was anybody else involved?

51:47.827 --> 51:49.689
Are you sure that you
can't make a statement?

51:49.758 --> 51:51.965
I know you...

51:52.034 --> 51:54.000
Dennis, can you tell us
what happened on "The Blue"?

51:54.068 --> 51:58.551
Look, I appreciate
you've all got papers to sell.

52:00.103 --> 52:03.000
He tells quite a story--

52:03.068 --> 52:05.137
an attack in the darkness,

52:05.206 --> 52:06.862
ruthless gangsters,

52:06.931 --> 52:10.482
a massacre from which
only he escaped.

52:12.310 --> 52:14.137
I was hoping you
could shed some light

52:14.206 --> 52:16.965
on a bit of a puzzle, though.

52:17.034 --> 52:18.724
The ballistic report says

52:18.793 --> 52:21.482
that all of the bullets
and the bullet holes

52:21.551 --> 52:23.068
found in the boat,

52:23.137 --> 52:27.344
the bullets that must have
been used to kill your friends,

52:27.413 --> 52:30.344
were shot
from a small-bore revolver,

52:30.413 --> 52:32.000
Smith & Wesson.

52:39.827 --> 52:41.965
Usually criminals
among my countrymen

52:42.034 --> 52:46.448
would prefer automatic weapons,
so...

52:46.517 --> 52:48.241
it's strange.

52:50.172 --> 52:52.758
So what are you saying?

52:52.827 --> 52:54.551
Perhaps your friends
didn't perish

52:54.620 --> 52:57.103
in quite the way
he's telling it,

52:57.172 --> 53:00.000
assuming they really are dead.

53:01.689 --> 53:03.068
Why would he lie?

53:03.137 --> 53:05.965
I thought you might know.

53:12.931 --> 53:14.620
No. No.
Denny wouldn't do that.

53:14.689 --> 53:16.896
- You sure?
- Emma?

53:19.137 --> 53:20.655
You got my number.

53:23.448 --> 53:26.586
Let me begin by saying
that these two days--

53:26.655 --> 53:28.103
Look, look, look, look.
There he is. There he is.

53:28.172 --> 53:29.448
There's Dennis and that girl.

53:29.517 --> 53:31.793
Dennis! Dennis!
Can you come here?

53:31.862 --> 53:33.827
Dennis?
Dennis? Dennis, please.

53:33.896 --> 53:35.620
Just one more minute.
Just one more question.

53:37.344 --> 53:38.448
Dennis, please.

53:38.517 --> 53:40.931
Just want to ask one
more question.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.586
No more.

53:42.655 --> 53:44.586
Take them off. Thank you.

53:44.655 --> 53:46.172
Stay there, please.

53:51.689 --> 53:52.931
Mum and Dad are cool.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.137
You can stay as long
as you like.

53:58.206 --> 53:59.758
Thanks.

54:01.172 --> 54:02.896
They're so happy
one of us is alive,

54:02.965 --> 54:06.448
I think they'd agree to...
anything...

54:11.896 --> 54:14.448
Even if I'm not
their first choice.

54:20.103 --> 54:22.827
You must have been
so scared...

54:25.620 --> 54:29.137
All those men with guns.

54:29.206 --> 54:31.448
Yeah.

54:31.517 --> 54:33.344
I can't stop seeing them.

54:42.275 --> 54:44.310
I'm so happy you're here.

54:49.793 --> 54:52.034
I don't know what I'd do
if you weren't.

54:56.310 --> 54:58.172
I'm so glad I'm here too.
