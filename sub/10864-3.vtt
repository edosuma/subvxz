[Laughs]
Nothing special.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.440
Is there anything special
you want to tell me?

01:21.440 --> 01:23.960
Oh. Yeah.

01:23.960 --> 01:25.960
Is, um,
a fresh zit?

Gotcha.

01:28.040 --> 01:29.200
That's OK.

talking about?

01:38.040 --> 01:41.440

at your diary, and...

Um...

01:43.960 --> 01:45.560
This isn't my diary.

01:56.120 --> 01:58.000
It wasn't even hers.

But you thought
it was.

01:59.040 --> 02:01.240
Why did you
do that?

02:01.240 --> 02:02.880
To prove a point.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.400
What, that you
have a death wish?

02:05.400 --> 02:07.560
No. For my story.

I'd say that's
pretty bad.

get to do for fun

How'd he get
so rich?

taking their valuables.

she hit the rocks.

That's when they
started coming for me,

15:08.240 --> 15:10.840
ghosts from
that cursed ship.

15:10.840 --> 15:13.360
I started to time my sleep.

15:13.360 --> 15:18.360
I'd go to sleep long enough
for them to reach my door,

15:18.360 --> 15:20.280
and then I'd wake up

15:20.280 --> 15:23.360
and they'd slide back
into the deep.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.560
I finally couldn't
take it anymore,

15:26.560 --> 15:29.560
so I returned everything
I took from her.

15:29.560 --> 15:32.640
I tossed it all back
into the ocean.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.320
And?

15:34.320 --> 15:36.800
And they kept coming!

15:36.800 --> 15:39.800
It's revenge they want,
not restitution.

15:39.800 --> 15:42.480
You're sure you gave
everything back?

15:42.480 --> 15:44.280
All but what
I traded away.

15:44.280 --> 15:45.680
You traded some away?

15:45.680 --> 15:47.800
Well, I have
quite a collection

15:47.800 --> 15:49.320
of sea-faring memorabilia.

15:49.320 --> 15:51.320
Cost me a handsome sum.

15:51.320 --> 15:54.320
<i>I had to trade some of
the gold from the Del Rio</i>

15:54.320 --> 15:56.320
to get it.

15:56.320 --> 15:57.520
Well, that's it!

15:57.520 --> 15:58.920
Beg your pardon.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.800
You traded some of
the gold from the wreck.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.800
You didn't
give it all back.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.800
Well, I tried to track
the pieces down,

16:06.800 --> 16:08.320
but it was no use.

16:08.320 --> 16:10.800
I couldn't return
all that I took.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.360
Then give them
your collection.

16:13.360 --> 16:14.760
Dean, give it up!

16:14.760 --> 16:16.320
No! Think about it.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.320
If you give back
all that you traded for,

16:19.320 --> 16:21.240
it might
even things up.

16:21.240 --> 16:24.200
He's not gonna throw all
the stuff in the water.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.760
He's loony,
not stupid!

16:25.760 --> 16:28.760
You know something, lad?
You might be right.

16:28.760 --> 16:31.760
This all has to go back!

16:31.760 --> 16:33.880
Every last bit of it.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.920
I don't know who's
crazier, you or him.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.360
Let's get outta here.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.840
You can't leave now!

16:40.840 --> 16:43.680
I need to return
this tonight.

16:43.680 --> 16:44.680
To who?

16:44.680 --> 16:46.480
To the site
of the wreck!

16:46.480 --> 16:48.000
This might just do it!

16:48.000 --> 16:50.240
I need your help
loading the dingy.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.720
No way!

16:52.840 --> 16:54.120
Remember, my friend,

16:54.120 --> 16:56.720
they're after you,
too.

16:56.720 --> 16:59.640
Once they know you,
they're not gonna stop.

17:01.040 --> 17:05.400
I'm not so sure you want to
try going to sleep just yet.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.119
OK. But as soon
as the boat's loaded,

17:08.119 --> 17:09.640
we're outta here!

17:09.640 --> 17:11.599
Ah. Excellent.

17:11.599 --> 17:14.240
Well, now. Uh...

17:14.240 --> 17:16.599
Everything
in that case goes...

17:31.760 --> 17:34.760
Hey, maybe you should
take this in case--

17:38.600 --> 17:39.720
Captain!

17:39.720 --> 17:42.720
And you knocked
my glasses in the water!

17:42.720 --> 17:45.200
Could you be any more
of an idiot?

17:45.200 --> 17:47.200
Come on, man.
Don't go now!

17:47.200 --> 17:48.720
Let's go!
He'll be OK.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.720
We can't just
leave him here.

17:50.720 --> 17:53.040
The Water Demons'll
get him for sure.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.560
But you could
stop them.

17:58.560 --> 17:59.720
Me.

17:59.720 --> 18:01.720
You could take
the stuff back.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.200
What about you?

18:03.200 --> 18:06.200
I can't see without my
glasses. I'd never make it.

18:06.200 --> 18:07.720
Then we'll both go.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.240
Someone's gotta stay and
make sure he stays awake.

18:10.240 --> 18:13.720
If he conks out, the Water
Demons'll get him for sure.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.720
Coming...

18:15.720 --> 18:17.000
They're coming!

18:17.000 --> 18:20.600
<i>You want me to go
out there by myself.</i>

18:20.600 --> 18:23.960
Why don't you just do the right
thing for once in your life?

18:27.280 --> 18:30.280
You keep him awake!

18:49.800 --> 18:51.400
Come on, captain.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.160
Hang in there.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.000
Here's your stuff!

18:59.000 --> 19:01.080
Hope you like it!

19:13.080 --> 19:14.240
Captain!

19:14.240 --> 19:15.720
Captain, wake up!

19:15.720 --> 19:17.800
You gotta stay up,
captain!

19:21.720 --> 19:23.520
Here's the last piece!

19:23.520 --> 19:25.400
Now leave us alone!

19:25.400 --> 19:26.600
Aah!

19:30.920 --> 19:32.120
Aah!

19:32.120 --> 19:33.880
Grave robber!

19:37.680 --> 19:39.200
Captain, please!

20:05.240 --> 20:07.640
[Breathless laughter]

20:12.240 --> 20:14.680
Ah ha ha ha ha!

20:27.200 --> 20:28.600
Did you do it?

20:28.600 --> 20:30.600
Yeah. I dumped it all.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.120
How's he doing?

20:32.120 --> 20:34.960
Not good.
He's out cold.

20:38.200 --> 20:40.120
What are we gonna
do?

20:40.120 --> 20:42.440
We'd better get him
to a doctor.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.440
Looks kinda big.

20:44.440 --> 20:47.120
Let me try to find
my glasses.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.240
Hey, Dean.

20:49.240 --> 20:50.920
He doesn't look
so good.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.680
I gotta find my glasses.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.120
Dean!

20:57.120 --> 20:58.480
Dean!

20:58.480 --> 21:00.400
No! Let him go!

21:00.400 --> 21:03.280
He didn't do anything!
What do you want?

21:03.280 --> 21:05.560
Why don't you
leave us alone?!

21:09.480 --> 21:12.400
Is this it?
Is this what you want?

21:12.400 --> 21:14.640
I'm sorry I took it!
I was wrong!

21:14.640 --> 21:17.440
And the captain was wrong!
We're sorry!

21:22.120 --> 21:24.120
Dean! Oh!

21:30.640 --> 21:33.080
You OK?
I thought you were dead!

21:33.080 --> 21:34.560
[Coughing]

21:34.560 --> 21:36.200
Yeah.

21:39.640 --> 21:40.640
Yeah.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.560
What hit me?

21:47.560 --> 21:49.560
Uh... that's not
important.

21:49.560 --> 21:52.080
How's your head?

21:52.080 --> 21:54.200
It's lumpy.

21:55.440 --> 21:56.960
What happened?

21:58.160 --> 22:00.080
Shawn took it
all back.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.560
It worked.

22:02.560 --> 22:04.680
The demons
are at rest.

22:06.160 --> 22:07.560
Thank you, boys.

22:07.560 --> 22:11.120
Finally, I can sleep
with a clear conscience.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.440
Hey, look!

22:25.600 --> 22:27.560
Dean, look at this.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.520
"Please accept
this $4.90

22:32.520 --> 22:35.520
"as payment for
5 candy bars

22:35.520 --> 22:38.040
and one pack
of gum."

22:38.040 --> 22:40.320
This mean anything
to you?

22:40.320 --> 22:41.560
Yeah.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.640
Kinda does.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.400
The end.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.440
All right!
Good story.

22:52.440 --> 22:55.240
That still doesn't get you
off the hook for the diary.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.720
Samantha: Lay off,
Frank.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.320
Betty Ann:
Come on, Frank.

23:05.080 --> 23:07.520
Hey, whose is this?

23:07.520 --> 23:09.040
It's Tucker's.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.080
Hey!

23:13.080 --> 23:15.040
This is mine.

23:15.040 --> 23:16.800
And this.

23:19.520 --> 23:21.040
It's my magic book.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.480
"Dear Gary,

23:26.480 --> 23:28.960
"thanks for letting me
borrow this stuff.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.960
"Sorry I didn't
ask first.

23:30.960 --> 23:35.000
"P.S. What are you doing
in my knapsack?

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
"Didn't you get anything
out of my story?

23:38.000 --> 23:40.120
Tucker."
