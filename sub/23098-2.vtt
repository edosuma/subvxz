00:05.180 --> 00:08.375
Our world is not always the same.

00:09.660 --> 00:13.116
Hidden from our view lies
a different world...

00:14.340 --> 00:16.476
..creatures utterly unlike us...

00:18.740 --> 00:20.217
..almost alien...

00:22.300 --> 00:26.100
..yet they are more numerous
than any other group on the planet.

00:30.900 --> 00:36.360
Welcome to the fascinating
world of the arthropods - spiders,

00:36.980 --> 00:39.940
scorpions and insects.

00:40.220 --> 00:43.980
Today, we have new camera
techniques that will allow us

00:44.100 --> 00:48.580
to reveal in greater detail
than ever before their lives -

00:48.920 --> 00:52.662
the way they fight and feed
and reproduce.

00:53.420 --> 00:57.460
This series uses specially
developed 3-D camera technology

00:57.580 --> 01:00.780
to study the micro world
in extraordinary detail,

01:01.400 --> 01:04.720
both on location and in specially
constructed environments.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.080
We'll witness the births,
the challenges they face

01:09.300 --> 01:11.500
and the moments when their lives
hang in the balance.

01:13.520 --> 01:16.971
And that may help us
understand how it is that today

01:17.520 --> 01:23.306
over 80% of all animal species
on this planet are arthropods.

01:24.500 --> 01:25.700
In the series,

01:25.920 --> 01:29.240
we'll see the way they have
evolved from the comparative

01:29.360 --> 01:33.760
simplicity of the millipede
to vast colonies that contain

01:33.880 --> 01:36.080
hundreds, even millions,
of individuals.

01:38.280 --> 01:41.600
We'll witness the most extraordinary
transformations

01:41.720 --> 01:43.040
in the animal kingdom.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.840
We'll meet ants that farm,

01:46.960 --> 01:49.360
spiders that can cast their webs...

01:51.160 --> 01:55.960
..and the bug that wears the bodies
of its victims as a disguise.

01:57.640 --> 02:00.920
Welcome to a strange
and dangerous world.

02:19.480 --> 02:22.880
Ever since they first appeared
on land, the arthropods have

02:23.000 --> 02:29.117
been fighting one another -
for territory, a mate and a meal.

02:32.660 --> 02:35.420
To survive,
every living thing must eat

02:35.540 --> 02:39.580
and around 10% of arthropods
eat other arthropods.

03:00.220 --> 03:04.980
Some of the most remarkable hunting
strategies in the animal kingdom

03:05.100 --> 03:07.380
are happening right under our noses.

03:12.480 --> 03:17.480
These are whirligig beetles and they
live on ponds throughout the world.

03:21.240 --> 03:25.880
They use the water's surface very
like radar to detect their prey.

03:37.040 --> 03:40.960
A stick insect held fast to the
water by surface tension.

03:43.920 --> 03:47.120
Its struggles send vibrations
across the water's surface.

03:50.140 --> 03:54.460
The whirligig senses them and puts
its water radar into action.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.960
It spins at a rate of around
12 times a second.

04:09.120 --> 04:13.600
This spinning motion sends tiny
ripples across the water.

04:15.720 --> 04:18.320
These bounce back
from the stick insect.

04:19.800 --> 04:25.280
The whirligig detects the faint
echoes in much the same way as radar

04:25.400 --> 04:27.600
and it closes in on the victim.

04:30.560 --> 04:33.160
Whirligigs all over
the pond join in.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.320
They too have their own water radar.

04:37.300 --> 04:42.020
The stick insect stands little
chance against this voracious horde.

04:46.740 --> 04:49.460
Whirligigs use
the environment to help them

04:49.580 --> 04:51.100
detect the presence of prey...

04:52.740 --> 04:54.300
..but the surface of water

04:54.420 --> 04:57.100
is not the only media for carrying
messages.

05:01.580 --> 05:05.420
Some predators have developed
more sophisticated ways of hunting.

05:09.320 --> 05:12.320
One group of arthropods,
the spiders,

05:12.440 --> 05:16.000
produce a substance so versatile
and so strong

05:16.120 --> 05:21.280
it's used by 30,000
different species - silk.

05:21.400 --> 05:24.720
They use it for a multitude
of different purposes -

05:24.840 --> 05:27.040
for transport, for spinning
a filament that

05:27.160 --> 05:31.440
catches in the wind and then carries
them aloft, as trap lines,

05:31.560 --> 05:34.480
as lining for their nests, but,
above all,

05:34.600 --> 05:36.680
they use it to trap their prey.

05:52.340 --> 05:56.540
These striking patterns of silk
are made by one of the rainforest's

05:56.660 --> 06:02.420
most effective predators - Argiope,
the St Andrew's Cross spider.

06:06.020 --> 06:09.860
Nobody is sure why Argiope
constructs this conspicuous

06:09.980 --> 06:12.460
white silken cross
at the centre of her web.

06:14.520 --> 06:18.240
Some experts think
that it serves as a warning,

06:18.360 --> 06:21.160
but this fly certainly
didn't notice it.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.320
(BUZZING)

06:25.080 --> 06:26.040
(BUZZING STOPS)

06:38.180 --> 06:42.140
Argiope wraps her catch
to prevent it from escaping,

06:42.460 --> 06:47.780
using not web silk, but a different
non-stretch kind...

06:48.100 --> 06:52.645
and then she paralyses it
with her toxic venom.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.859
She'll eat it later.

07:02.540 --> 07:06.820
Soon, another potential victim
strays onto the web -

07:07.940 --> 07:09.980
a Portia spider.

07:25.380 --> 07:27.700
But before Argiope can strike,

07:27.920 --> 07:32.335
Portia retreats
to the edge of the web.

07:40.220 --> 07:44.302
And then she does something
very curious.

07:52.880 --> 07:56.240
She plucks on very carefully
chosen strands.

07:59.400 --> 08:05.237
She creates rhythmic vibrations
that calm Argiope.

08:21.780 --> 08:27.998
Instead of attacking Portia, Argiope
returns to the centre of her web...

08:29.560 --> 08:33.200
..and that is exactly where Portia
wants her...

08:34.520 --> 08:37.520
..because Portia hunts other spiders

08:37.640 --> 08:41.179
and has Argiope in her sights.

08:49.160 --> 08:53.160
She moves off the web,
so that she can survey the scene.

08:56.760 --> 08:59.800
Over many hours,
she moves around the surrounding

08:59.920 --> 09:04.480
branches in search of the best point
to launch an attack.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.411
She uses these robotic movements
to camouflage herself from Argiope.

09:19.200 --> 09:22.560
To poorly sighted creatures,
she probably looks like a thread

09:22.680 --> 09:29.525
fluttering in the wind and this buys
time for her surveillance.

09:35.880 --> 09:40.280
Portia has superb eyesight and she
can judge angles and distances

09:40.400 --> 09:42.780
with great precision.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.400
She's planning to
pounce on Argiope.

10:02.540 --> 10:05.630
She has to be exactly on target.

10:16.740 --> 10:21.040
Her venom kills Argiope instantly.

10:26.900 --> 10:30.700
Like most spiders, she can't eat
solid food, so she pumps

10:30.820 --> 10:36.343
her digestive juices into her prey
and then sucks the corpse dry.

10:54.880 --> 10:59.200
Our planet is home to over
a million species of arthropods.

11:05.460 --> 11:09.540
Today, they outnumber other
animal species four to one.

11:10.820 --> 11:14.100
That's part of their fascination -
their variety.

11:18.780 --> 11:21.300
And that variety is
evident in the predators,

11:21.420 --> 11:24.340
the bugs that hunt other bugs...

11:27.860 --> 11:31.399
..and the most ingenious of all
are the spiders.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.340
Most spiders
capture their prey in a web.

11:38.220 --> 11:41.260
Glue on the silken filaments
traps a victim

11:41.380 --> 11:45.700
and vibrations through them tell
the spider that a meal is waiting.

11:51.400 --> 11:54.960
But webs come in many shapes
and forms and different spiders

11:55.180 --> 11:58.620
have favoured different places
in which to construct them.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.820
The inside of a log is a good place
to catch beetles

12:04.240 --> 12:05.560
and even small reptiles.

12:13.460 --> 12:15.540
This tangle of silk is the home

12:15.760 --> 12:18.720
of one of Australia's
most feared spiders -

12:19.240 --> 12:21.702
the highly venomous redback.

12:23.640 --> 12:27.680
Despite its appearance,
this web is actually highly complex

12:27.800 --> 12:29.520
and very finely engineered.

12:31.480 --> 12:35.680
It contains some of the strongest
silk produced by any spider...

12:37.060 --> 12:39.140
..so strong than she can catch

12:39.260 --> 12:43.380
and transport prey far larger
than herself.

13:03.700 --> 13:08.540
First, she winds strands of silk
around the struggling beetle

13:08.660 --> 13:09.620
to immobilise it.

13:20.220 --> 13:22.940
When the beetle tires, she bites.

13:33.440 --> 13:36.960
She must pull her victim up to
the part of the web where she lives.

13:40.800 --> 13:44.560
She starts snipping
and re-attaching the lines of silk.

13:55.860 --> 13:59.540
These lines are under tension,
they're spring-loaded,

13:59.960 --> 14:04.673
and that allows the redback
to haul huge weights around her web.

14:06.200 --> 14:10.357
The tiny male watches as
she retrieves her catch.

14:18.600 --> 14:21.880
Spider silk is as stretchy
as elastic,

14:22.000 --> 14:24.080
but harder to snap than steel.

14:37.780 --> 14:41.300
As day turns to night and the forest
plunges into darkness,

14:41.420 --> 14:44.020
nocturnal predators are coming
out to hunt.

14:44.640 --> 14:49.040
One of them is Deinopis -
the ogre-faced spider.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.600
She is found throughout the tropics

14:52.720 --> 14:56.988
and she uses silk in a very
different way.

15:00.920 --> 15:04.332
She has turned it into a net.

15:10.680 --> 15:14.240
Her sticklike body makes her hard to
spot amongst the branches.

15:25.520 --> 15:29.720
Her huge central pair of eyes
are 2,000 times more sensitive

15:29.840 --> 15:31.480
than ours.

15:31.600 --> 15:34.600
And to keep it that way,
she completely rebuilds her retina

15:34.720 --> 15:37.477
at the back of each eye
every single day.

15:39.320 --> 15:42.840
They enable her to hunt in almost
complete darkness.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.360
She hangs an inch or so
above the forest floor

15:47.480 --> 15:49.966
from a series of silk lines.

15:58.660 --> 16:00.060
She strikes.

16:03.400 --> 16:06.320
She stretches her net over her
prey...

16:09.080 --> 16:11.960
..and then wraps it in silk to
immobilise it.

16:20.480 --> 16:25.896
At last, she begins a slow
process of digesting her meal.

16:29.400 --> 16:33.160
For her prey, at least,
the end is quick.

16:34.820 --> 16:38.060
Her fast-acting venom
kills almost instantly.

16:39.300 --> 16:44.796
But venom can have other uses
and some victims are not so lucky.

16:49.800 --> 16:54.400
Venom can be used for both
defence and attack,

16:54.520 --> 16:57.680
but some arthropods use
it in a more subtle way.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.967
Not to kill, but to control.

17:04.940 --> 17:07.460
In the woodlands of Africa
and South Asia,

17:07.579 --> 17:11.420
lives a creature that has mastered
the use of venom like few others.

17:15.800 --> 17:19.040
Meet the jewelled cockroach wasp.

17:19.359 --> 17:22.960
Her iridescent body stands out
brightly against the forest floor,

17:23.079 --> 17:27.058
though the purpose of her
bright colouration is not known.

17:31.220 --> 17:36.374
Certainly, any bug that does spot
her will do well to steer clear.

17:40.080 --> 17:43.651
She hunts, but not for herself.

17:47.540 --> 17:52.300
This cockroach is exactly what
she's been looking for.

17:52.898 --> 17:55.618
It's much larger
and stronger than she is.

17:57.820 --> 18:00.980
Nevertheless, she attacks.

18:06.040 --> 18:08.600
She won't kill it.
She wants it alive.

18:24.780 --> 18:29.609
First, she injects it with a venom
that paralyses its front legs.

18:32.380 --> 18:34.780
This prevents it fighting her off.

18:38.540 --> 18:42.180
Now she injects a second venom
directly into its brain.

18:46.420 --> 18:51.786
Amazingly, this instantly stops
the cockroach responding to danger.

18:57.680 --> 19:00.089
It becomes completely docile.

19:07.320 --> 19:10.676
She leads her victim to
an underground burrow.

19:13.620 --> 19:18.000
Here, she'll lay her eggs directly
onto the cockroach's body.

19:22.820 --> 19:25.860
She conceals the burrow's entrance
with leaf litter.

19:25.980 --> 19:30.801
This will stop other predators
finding the cockroach or her lava.

19:41.180 --> 19:45.340
The lava spends five days sucking
the cockroach's body fluids,

19:45.760 --> 19:48.840
then it will burrow inside
and begin to feed.

19:56.300 --> 19:58.900
It eats the least
essential parts first

19:59.120 --> 20:03.080
and saves the nervous system
and the breathing system for last.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.240
A process that takes
ten days or more.

20:12.360 --> 20:17.420
And for all that time the cockroach
is alive and powerless to respond.

20:21.300 --> 20:26.280
Over a period of weeks, the lava
continues to grow and develop

20:26.300 --> 20:29.900
until, eventually, all that remains
of the cockroach

20:30.020 --> 20:31.460
is a dead, empty husk.

20:33.720 --> 20:37.828
And from it emerges
a fully mature adult wasp...

20:39.720 --> 20:43.611
..ready to repeat the gruesome cycle
for itself.

20:51.700 --> 20:55.660
We have seen some of the deadly
ways in which arthropods

20:56.480 --> 20:58.120
prey upon one another.

20:58.820 --> 21:03.390
The way these creatures hunt has
shaped their bodies and their lives.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.560
The struggle for survival amongst
arthropods is often brutal,

21:27.180 --> 21:30.380
but that's a key to their success.

21:30.600 --> 21:34.000
The strongest survive to produce
the next generation.

21:36.120 --> 21:40.160
In the next programme, I'll be
looking at how the desire for sex

21:40.280 --> 21:44.302
has shaped bugs into a
bewildering array of forms.

21:48.160 --> 21:51.191
We'll see how courtship is not
always what it seems.

21:54.380 --> 21:58.740
Some males bribe females into having
sex.

21:58.860 --> 22:00.312
And others trick them.

22:03.100 --> 22:07.180
And we'll see the next generation
of micro-monsters take their first

22:07.300 --> 22:12.164
tentative steps into their small
and often dangerous world.
