02:57.210 --> 02:58.370
Hotel mondial.

02:58.444 --> 02:59.672
Le mondial. Tres bien.

02:59.746 --> 03:00.610
Avec cette pluie ca risque de prendre un

03:05.852 --> 03:08.480
moment. L'autoroute est ferme. A cause

03:09.756 --> 03:12.850
du 14 juillet.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.368
[Do you mind the radio?]

03:23.136 --> 03:24.535
[Do you want me to turn the radio off?]

03:26.573 --> 03:27.369
I don't speak french.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.464
Ah. American?

03:29.609 --> 03:30.439
That's right.

03:30.977 --> 03:34.378
That's good because I speak a little english.

03:34.414 --> 03:37.577
I asked if you mind the radio.
Music. You know.

03:37.650 --> 03:40.312
Super cool.

03:45.758 --> 03:46.656
What time is it?

03:46.726 --> 03:47.852
Time, time, time. I don't know. Daytime.

03:51.764 --> 03:53.322
Are you in town for business?

03:53.733 --> 03:54.256
Yes.

03:56.603 --> 03:59.663
It's a nice hotel. Your hotel.
Very big rooms.

04:04.043 --> 04:05.101
Do you know paris?

04:05.979 --> 04:12.009
I've been here once before.
When I was younger.

04:14.954 --> 04:16.250
Those were the days.

04:18.391 --> 04:19.187
Married?

04:20.125 --> 04:20.922
I beg your pardon?

04:21.793 --> 04:22.726
Do you have a wife?

04:24.364 --> 04:25.262
No.

04:33.673 --> 04:34.298
Why?

04:35.141 --> 04:37.006
Well, if you need a wife for the night...

04:37.343 --> 04:38.173
for business.

04:39.512 --> 04:40.877
I give you my number.

04:42.415 --> 04:46.647
Very nice girl. French.
Like when you were young.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.447
You just tell me and I set it up.

04:53.326 --> 04:54.258
What you laughing at?

04:54.827 --> 04:56.192
You let moises set it up.

05:23.356 --> 05:28.123
Your package... it arrived in the
last night of before last night.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.433
The toilet.

05:36.269 --> 05:39.898
From here you can operate the television.

05:44.110 --> 05:44.769
Merci.

05:44.911 --> 05:45.775
He starts to leave.

05:49.315 --> 05:54.878
Oh, wait.

06:02.895 --> 06:05.125
The bellboy turns around.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.357
What time is it?

06:08.601 --> 06:10.125
What time is it?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.497
Time.

06:12.572 --> 06:16.770
Ah. Yes. Il est presque huit heures

07:45.865 --> 07:46.559
bonjour.

07:50.837 --> 07:51.565
Bonjour.

07:57.443 --> 08:01.379
Wow.
Vous avez une belle chambre. Je ne

08:03.549 --> 08:12.685
ca sera 150 francs de I heure.
Toute la nuit pour 700.
D'avance. Et faudra porter un...

08:15.795 --> 08:16.921
I... don't speak french.

08:20.132 --> 08:21.360
It's okay.

08:23.002 --> 08:28.770
It will be one thousand francs for all night.
In advance.

08:29.642 --> 08:31.473
We can do it now if you want.

08:31.811 --> 08:33.472
Well, let me just dry up.

08:34.580 --> 08:35.910
Okay, but it's not necessary.

09:18.491 --> 09:19.321
What's your name?

09:19.525 --> 09:22.722
Zoe or zoey. Which ever you like.

09:25.831 --> 09:26.729
My name's zed.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.164
That's funny.
We both have z names.

09:32.438 --> 09:33.200
What was that?

09:35.074 --> 09:37.201
You can take those off. The pants.

09:42.515 --> 09:43.675
I'd rather watch you get undressed first.

09:49.622 --> 09:50.281
All right.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.788
Slower.

10:00.666 --> 10:01.189
All right

10:02.835 --> 10:05.736
mister america. Zed.

10:13.245 --> 10:14.303
Slow enough for you?

12:35.788 --> 12:36.516
I'm cold.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.094
Zed?

12:50.569 --> 12:51.331
Yes?

12:53.239 --> 12:55.139
Moises told me you were in
town for business.

12:56.075 --> 12:56.973
Yes.

12:57.710 --> 12:58.836
What kind of business?

13:00.312 --> 13:01.006
Why?

13:02.715 --> 13:04.012
I don't know. I'm just curious.

13:06.185 --> 13:10.178
Do you ask all your clients questions?

13:12.158 --> 13:15.719
No. Just the ones I like.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.325
So you like me?

13:21.901 --> 13:22.492
Yes.

13:23.602 --> 13:24.227
Why?

13:29.575 --> 13:31.600
I run into some real creeps.
You know.

13:33.112 --> 13:36.047
How do you know
I'm a good person?

13:37.550 --> 13:40.485
Body language.
We fit together.

13:41.420 --> 13:46.551
All men and women fit together.
Hell, even some men fit together.

13:51.897 --> 13:56.357
No, but you know, we clicked.
You made me orgasm.

13:57.136 --> 14:00.503
Do you know how often I orgasm with a man
moises sets me up with?

14:03.042 --> 14:04.236
No I don't.

14:11.650 --> 14:12.810
Usually never.
They're almost always fat like pigs.

14:17.957 --> 14:19.447
And you make me feel safe.
That's

14:21.393 --> 14:23.861
something more
important than the orgasm.

14:26.232 --> 14:29.326
An integral part
maybe of the orgasm.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.634
I never really thought of it like that.

14:33.906 --> 14:34.964
Well, its true. Zed nods at this.

14:40.279 --> 14:41.337
Turn off the television.

14:44.316 --> 14:46.307
So I mean it when I tell you zed,

14:48.754 --> 14:50.051
I like you very much.

14:51.423 --> 14:52.481
Well, I like you too zoe.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.321
Honest?

14:57.963 --> 15:00.488
Why? For the same reason?

15:01.967 --> 15:04.765
Any man can orgasm. Even with his own hand.
Zed stares ahead as he thinks of an answer.

15:06.705 --> 15:10.869
Well, I like your honesty.
You're open.

15:12.878 --> 15:14.140
Unlike most prostitutes
I've been with.

15:15.681 --> 15:17.581
She doesn't like the sound of this.
She slaps him.

15:17.783 --> 15:22.914
I am not a prostitute!
Zed is a little surprised at this.

15:25.491 --> 15:29.689
Really?
Can I have my francs back then?

15:30.462 --> 15:31.394
I'm a student.
And to pay for the

15:32.798 --> 15:35.528
classes I became an escort.
It's my

15:35.834 --> 15:37.631
choice to sleep with you.

15:37.736 --> 15:38.828
I see.

15:40.205 --> 15:41.001
What?
You don't understand.

15:41.140 --> 15:42.767
No, I do.

15:43.676 --> 15:44.540
Hey, it's not easy.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.602
I didn't say it was.

15:49.848 --> 15:52.476
I'm here because I want to.

15:53.585 --> 15:54.244
Okay,

16:00.793 --> 16:05.821
okay relax.
What school do you go to?

16:08.133 --> 16:08.963
The centre du art, paris.

16:10.469 --> 16:13.870
That's really interesting.

16:16.675 --> 16:18.438
What kind of art do you study?

16:20.746 --> 16:22.179
Not any of the old shit.

16:23.082 --> 16:23.776
Oh.

16:25.150 --> 16:29.450
I have a day job too.
Three times a week.

16:33.826 --> 16:38.263
But someday there
will be only my art.

16:40.032 --> 16:42.796
What kind of things do you paint?

16:43.869 --> 16:49.330
I don't paint.
I make things. Objects.

16:51.076 --> 16:54.239
Not like sculpture.
Like life... but with

16:55.314 --> 16:57.407
what I do
I do only for the objects.

16:59.084 --> 17:01.143
I d like to see one of these.

17:02.187 --> 17:05.679
What? So you could see the
work of a whore?

17:08.627 --> 17:14.759
Zoey. I'm sorry for calling you a prostitute.
I didn't understand the difference.

17:16.568 --> 17:20.560
The difference is a prostitute would have
lied to you about her orgasm.

18:14.326 --> 18:16.385
What time is it?

18:16.995 --> 18:17.757
I have no idea. Night time.

18:17.963 --> 18:19.294
I'm going to take a shower.

18:20.799 --> 18:21.993
Eric. Come in.

18:27.639 --> 18:28.731
They hug.

18:31.343 --> 18:33.811
What happened to you?
I thought you were going to call.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.014
Oh I see.

18:37.983 --> 18:40.713
You have been busy.

18:40.752 --> 18:42.811
Sorry, I asked the hotel to
give me a wake up call.

18:43.088 --> 18:46.990
That's good, but now I am here.
So let's go. We have a lot to talk about.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.859
What about the girl?

18:50.929 --> 18:51.987
Is she your girlfriend?

18:52.064 --> 18:52.325
No.

18:52.397 --> 18:55.594
Fuck her. She's a dishrag whore.
Kick her out.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.428
I'll let her stay here tonight.

18:57.503 --> 18:58.993
don't be silly.
It's dangerous.

19:13.719 --> 19:14.378
Eric.

19:14.853 --> 19:15.820
don't worry about her.

19:36.041 --> 19:37.702
God damn it!

19:50.656 --> 19:53.056
So tell me, what have you
been up to?

19:54.026 --> 19:55.391
Eric, I liked that girl.

19:55.861 --> 19:58.762
Oh. Well, then why
didn't you stop me.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.024
Because you were
on a rampage.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.693
Look, your whole life you've
done nothing but fuck whores.

20:03.769 --> 20:05.361
A girl like that will
give you aids.

20:06.505 --> 20:08.405
Why don't you find a
nice girl in the suburbs?

20:08.473 --> 20:13.536
Because when you need to get off
you don't want to have to date for months to do it.

20:13.612 --> 20:15.011
Just use your hand like me.

20:17.549 --> 20:20.245
Sometimes you just need
honesty... and security.

20:21.486 --> 20:25.286
I don't understand.
Anyway, it's too late. Get dressed,
lets go out and meet the boys.

20:26.024 --> 20:28.219
Okay, let me take a shower.

20:28.293 --> 20:34.061
No, in paris it's good to
smell like you've been fucking.
It will make them respect you.

20:34.499 --> 20:36.296
Just put on a shirt
and a sport coat.

20:47.613 --> 20:49.706
I'm glad you came.
How long has it been?

20:50.582 --> 20:51.571
11 years.

20:52.451 --> 20:56.444
It's amazing, you know?

20:56.622 --> 21:00.217
Here you are.
One day in america. Now here.

21:04.229 --> 21:07.824
Well, to be honest there really wasn't
much happening for me in the states.

21:08.200 --> 21:12.034
But in paris your old friend
eric has a job for you, so you came.
That's good.

21:12.304 --> 21:13.999
How could
I resist your invitation?

21:14.273 --> 21:15.638
You would have been stupid to.

21:25.484 --> 21:27.111
So what have you been doing here?

21:32.257 --> 21:36.626
After school I spent some time in
algeria studying african philosophy.

21:37.562 --> 21:40.122
And then I bummed around.
You know. For fun.

21:41.199 --> 21:45.863
For a while I worked at le figaro.
The newspaper.

21:46.471 --> 21:48.871
Really?

21:49.574 --> 21:51.565
Yes. With an assumed
masters degree.

21:54.279 --> 21:58.807
And lately we have just been
bombing fascists here in paris.
You know, like terrorists.

22:00.185 --> 22:01.174
Zed looks over at him.

22:50.635 --> 22:51.602
Is that cat dead?

22:52.738 --> 22:56.834
I don't know. I think it's a sleep
but it's been there for days.

23:00.812 --> 23:02.746
I guess it is dead.

23:08.487 --> 23:11.217
They walk into the flat.

23:44.790 --> 23:46.189
Hello.
They all return the greeting.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.249
Okay. This is francois,
ricardo, jean, oliver, and claude. Got it?

23:54.099 --> 23:55.430
They all know who you are.

24:04.142 --> 24:04.767
Beer?

24:05.243 --> 24:06.039
Thanks.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.803
don't think of it. Come. Sit down.

24:21.860 --> 24:25.523
Easy. don't scare him.
He just wants to claim you.

24:26.565 --> 24:29.898
Let me introduce you properly.
This is enrique. The monkey screeches.

24:30.769 --> 24:32.236
He likes to be called chim chim,

24:32.804 --> 24:34.829
but we don't always get what we like... do we?
Again, the hideous creature screeches.

24:36.308 --> 24:36.831
Taistoi!

24:47.552 --> 24:48.541
Do you like hash?

24:51.523 --> 24:54.458
don't sit next to that junkie.

24:59.931 --> 25:02.559
That little shit monkey of yours
pissed on my billy holiday albums.

25:02.634 --> 25:03.965
Next time he's out the door.

25:07.138 --> 25:08.162
Zed, come here.

25:25.056 --> 25:27.320
don't ask me where we got this.

25:29.761 --> 25:33.822
On bastille day, all the banks are closed.
He places his hand on the blueprint.

25:35.066 --> 25:36.431
But this one. Bip.
The banque internationale de paris.

25:36.568 --> 25:40.197
And for being greedy
capitalists perhaps they will remain
closed next bastille day. Yes?

25:45.810 --> 25:47.710
We will go in and
shut the bank down.

25:47.913 --> 25:48.880
Now, look at this.

25:50.749 --> 25:53.149
As you can see,
only one person can start the alarm.

25:54.920 --> 25:57.218
The concierge, at this desk.

25:58.023 --> 25:59.012
We will take care of him.

25:59.090 --> 26:02.992
Then we can close the bank.
No one will know the difference since
every other bank will be closed.

26:03.295 --> 26:05.763
Are you sure
he won't push the alarm?

26:06.331 --> 26:09.596
Ahhh!
He's right next to the door.

26:09.701 --> 26:12.602
We'd have to be totally incompetent
not to stop him. don't worry about that.

26:12.737 --> 26:17.367
Here. This is where they keep the days
reserve cash. Okay fuck that.

26:19.711 --> 26:21.576
There are many vaults downstairs,

26:22.113 --> 26:25.913
but this is the vault we must get into.
This is where the real prize is.

26:25.984 --> 26:27.281
What kind of vault is that?

26:27.352 --> 26:29.115
Ah... swiss made. A caliber.

26:30.455 --> 26:31.513
Caliber?

26:32.824 --> 26:35.952
It'll take three hours.

26:36.027 --> 26:37.358
No, thats too long.

26:37.429 --> 26:38.657
Thats how long itll take.

26:38.730 --> 26:42.188
Well shit. It's too long.
We have to be in and out. Like that.
Or there will be suspicion.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.129
A little time is okay...
but too long and...

26:44.536 --> 26:46.003
well hold on a second.
What's this?

26:48.173 --> 26:48.969
Another vault.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.574
No this.

26:51.876 --> 26:53.605
I don't know...
it connects the two vaults.

26:54.646 --> 26:56.511
Well, what kind of
vault is this other one?

26:56.581 --> 26:58.913
Also swiss,
but this one is a poseidon.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.413
Why would those two
vaults be connected?

27:04.723 --> 27:06.088
I don't know.

27:07.258 --> 27:12.855
Because i can get into this
vault in half an hour. Maybe less.

27:12.964 --> 27:15.831
But this entry way is too
small to get the platen out.

27:15.934 --> 27:17.458
We have a lot of
merchandise in there.

27:17.535 --> 27:22.802
No, don't you see?
We get in through

27:23.174 --> 27:26.473
this secondary vault and take this passage
to the other main vault. From the inside
i could open the caliber vault in five minutes.

27:26.678 --> 27:28.646
You could open
it in five minutes?

27:28.947 --> 27:29.811
From the inside its easy.

27:29.881 --> 27:31.678
Hot damn.
That is our answer.

27:31.783 --> 27:32.477
Okay.

27:34.819 --> 27:36.047
When is bastille day?

27:36.121 --> 27:36.951
Tomorrow.

27:37.022 --> 27:39.752
Tomorrow!?
We're doing this tomorrow?

27:39.924 --> 27:40.982
But of course.

27:41.059 --> 27:42.822
It's impossible.

27:42.927 --> 27:45.623
It's not impossible.
Everyone knows what to do.

27:45.697 --> 27:46.925
I don't know what to do.

27:46.998 --> 27:50.195
You don't need to know shit.
Just get into the vault and we'll do the rest.

27:50.502 --> 27:51.628
I haven't even seen the bank.

27:51.703 --> 27:54.171
Fuck the bank.
Before we do a job we live life.

27:55.407 --> 27:56.897
It's better that way. Okay?

28:02.947 --> 28:03.606
Okay.

28:04.315 --> 28:07.409
Good. Now we do heroin!

29:13.118 --> 29:14.415
Do you want heroin?

29:14.986 --> 29:19.218
No. A little bit of heroin, some hash, a

29:19.624 --> 29:20.682
beer... and you re just right.

29:30.702 --> 29:32.363
Try some.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.237
Its called chasing the dragon.

29:39.077 --> 29:41.341
The chinese have been
doing it for centuries.

29:46.417 --> 29:48.317
I don't think so.

29:48.386 --> 29:50.411
Oh, but you must.

29:51.589 --> 29:54.319
It will make you feel

29:54.492 --> 29:59.293
as though the rest of
the world is in a bubble of glass

29:59.631 --> 30:01.690
and that you're
rubbing up against it

30:01.866 --> 30:04.164
like a bad windshield wiper.

30:26.124 --> 30:28.456
Do you like french cars?

30:30.328 --> 30:30.987
Yes.

30:31.062 --> 30:32.051
I like the cadillac.

30:32.797 --> 30:35.288
Fiftytwo to seventyfive.
Very nice.

30:36.301 --> 30:39.395
Up here you can see
the eiffel tower.

30:40.705 --> 30:42.195
Is tomorrow really
bastille day?

30:42.373 --> 30:45.399
Yes, tomorrow we pull
the biggest job in french history.

30:45.476 --> 30:47.944
And spend the rest
of our lives in

30:49.180 --> 30:51.239
monte carlo.

31:07.398 --> 31:17.239
[Faster, faster... go faster.
Let's beat them!]

31:26.918 --> 31:28.681
Watch it! don't crash my car.

31:40.765 --> 31:43.029
Over here is where the male prostitutes
sell themselves. Do you see?

31:43.334 --> 31:44.824
Fucking fags!

31:57.048 --> 31:58.242
Suce ma bite?!

32:01.753 --> 32:05.849
This is good to have you here.
We could not do this without you.

32:06.024 --> 32:08.686
Everyone has agreed to give you
double shares. That's good.

32:09.060 --> 32:09.890
That's good.

32:38.056 --> 32:39.489
You know i have aids.

32:40.925 --> 32:42.051
From the needle.

32:43.995 --> 32:44.654
Really?

32:46.631 --> 32:49.156
Okay, up here is the
arc de triomphe.

33:45.223 --> 33:46.588
So, how long
have you known eric?

33:58.703 --> 34:00.136
Well, eric's mother is american.

34:00.938 --> 34:02.132
Yeah, and his dad's french.

34:04.876 --> 34:08.869
They're divorced.
And she and his father had some kind of
six month split plan set

34:09.781 --> 34:13.911
up. So every six months he would come
back to the states. We were best friends.
Eventually he and his mother

34:14.385 --> 34:18.219
had a falling out and he stayed here.
It's been... years.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.259
Well, it's good to
have you here. Eric

34:24.862 --> 34:26.193
speaks fairly highly of you.
Say, he

34:27.665 --> 34:30.099
says you're a big fan
of viking films.

34:36.674 --> 34:37.368
Well... i suppose.
I used to be, when i

34:37.442 --> 34:40.842
was young.

34:44.348 --> 34:48.808
Oh they're the best.
Helmets with horns on them. Shit.
Thats fucking genius.

34:56.661 --> 34:59.459
How bout toy jazz?
You like it?

35:01.265 --> 35:03.062
Yeah... i guess.

35:03.301 --> 35:05.895
I love it. Its really good, you know?
Like real music. It has a heart and

35:06.704 --> 35:11.607
culture all it's own. It's, like,
jazz for dwarves... or guys in leiderhosen.

35:12.410 --> 35:16.676
Total purity of essence.

35:24.422 --> 35:25.184
Yeah.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.788
Hungry cannibals'd like it.

35:29.560 --> 35:31.425
Hungry cannibals'd like it!

35:31.629 --> 35:33.426
Here, you must drink
some of this wine,

35:33.498 --> 35:35.466
non merci,
c'est de la merde.

35:35.533 --> 35:36.693
La ferme.
C'est du bon vin.

35:36.767 --> 35:38.394
The fucking english.

35:40.872 --> 35:41.998
Look at him.
He's crazy.

36:36.127 --> 36:38.425
Hey! How was i?

36:39.397 --> 36:41.160
I didn't know you could play.

36:41.232 --> 36:43.598
I can't. But it's easy.
You just slide the thing.

36:52.143 --> 36:53.167
Do you like this place?

36:53.678 --> 36:54.406
Yeah.

36:54.512 --> 37:00.940
Good. This is the real paris.
Here in the cellar. Up there...
on the street, all just street trash.

37:01.018 --> 37:04.510
You have pompidou center,
the eiffel tower... all that tourist shit.

37:04.589 --> 37:07.149
La louvre.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.055
Good god the fucking louvre.

37:08.292 --> 37:10.453
All of that is for the guide buses.

37:11.262 --> 37:13.560
Even the people,
parisians, they are shit.

37:13.731 --> 37:15.528
No one in france likes them.
It's true.

37:15.700 --> 37:20.103
It's ridiculous. Even for us we get this.
But down here... -

37:20.171 --> 37:22.332
. away from everyone up there,
the tourists, the attractions, the fucking

37:22.540 --> 37:23.632
postcards, people change.

37:24.742 --> 37:27.074
They forget, because they can not see,
that they are in paris.

37:28.579 --> 37:31.047
It could be anywhere.
That's right. Down here you have music,
good food

37:31.349 --> 37:32.338
you have the wine.

37:32.984 --> 37:34.246
Even the wine. Its better.

37:34.952 --> 37:36.283
So what do you think?

37:38.990 --> 37:42.926
What do you think of paris?

37:43.060 --> 37:45.324
Well, if this is paris... then i like it.

37:49.233 --> 37:50.495
Good! Lets dance.

37:50.635 --> 37:52.569
No

38:43.354 --> 38:44.844
come on.
don't be a sissy.

38:44.922 --> 38:46.480
Just snort this with your nose.

38:48.659 --> 38:50.422
What's going on?
Why don't you do some?

38:57.034 --> 38:59.594
Should we be doing this
somewhere more private?

38:59.804 --> 39:01.795
Fuck them.
They can get their own.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.868
No, I mean,
is it safe to do it here?

39:07.878 --> 39:09.209
What!?
From the police?

39:13.884 --> 39:16.444
Doing heroin here is
safer than in amsterdam.

39:16.520 --> 39:17.885
I don't know if i should.

39:17.955 --> 39:18.853
But you must.

39:23.227 --> 39:26.492
But if you want to
feel good then why not?

39:26.564 --> 39:27.758
Go on.
You only live once.

41:19.944 --> 41:22.412
Why do you talk to
street trash like that?

41:27.485 --> 41:29.009
Whatever. Come on,
i want to talk to you.

41:37.528 --> 41:38.893
Meaty pussy.

41:57.681 --> 41:58.875
They walk against the wall.

41:59.617 --> 42:00.948
Open your mouth.
Oh god. No more.

42:07.024 --> 42:08.457
Shut up. You need it.
To see paris you need it.

42:23.741 --> 42:24.799
What was that?

42:25.142 --> 42:28.168
It's new. don't sweat it.
I wanted to

42:31.615 --> 42:33.173
tell you zed,
there are others here in

42:35.753 --> 42:40.190
paris, others that could
open that vault.

42:41.292 --> 42:44.352
There are others in germany,
switzerland,

42:44.428 --> 42:45.918
one in belgium...
all could do the job.

42:46.430 --> 42:50.059
I don't need those assholes though.

42:51.502 --> 42:52.901
I have you.

42:53.904 --> 42:57.203
I have the one man
i can trust in the whole world.

42:58.475 --> 43:00.670
My very good friend who

43:03.113 --> 43:04.410
i look up to.
You are the one.

43:05.115 --> 43:07.276
You are the one. Zed

43:10.621 --> 43:11.781
lt's good to see you.

43:14.058 --> 43:15.025
You know what
I'm saying?

43:17.127 --> 43:20.961
What did you give me?

43:21.031 --> 43:23.431
don't sweat it.

43:34.945 --> 43:35.969
We all die.

43:36.046 --> 43:39.482
The important thing is that in
life we experience everything.

43:39.550 --> 43:41.142
You know what I mean?

43:42.586 --> 43:43.450
No.

43:46.056 --> 43:48.388
Tomorrow is the greatest day
of our lives.

43:50.728 --> 43:55.995
The beginning of our lives.
The end of the complication.

43:58.736 --> 44:00.135
Do you have fire?

44:03.207 --> 44:07.906
Before, when we would make a bomb, you know,
to blow up a cafe or something,

44:08.078 --> 44:11.741
it would cost us a weeks wage
working at le fucking figaro.

44:14.685 --> 44:18.621
For me it was one week and
one half week.

44:59.196 --> 45:00.629
Wake up.
Wake up sleepy head.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.222
C'mon.
We have a bank to rob.

45:02.700 --> 45:05.032
Would you like a croissant?
Perhaps some coffee?

45:05.335 --> 45:07.098
I feel like i drank furniture
polish last night.

45:07.171 --> 45:10.106
You did. It was probably the bad
spanish wine you drank. I told you not to.

45:10.174 --> 45:12.972
Okay look, you should get ready.
The bank will be open for three hours today

45:13.043 --> 45:14.237
and traffic will be hell.

45:14.445 --> 45:15.571
My gear... i need it.

45:15.679 --> 45:17.647
Oh, but we went by
your hotel last night.

45:17.715 --> 45:18.682
don't you remember?

45:20.551 --> 45:21.483
We have all your things here.

45:21.552 --> 45:23.713
So get up and
take a shit so we can go.

45:43.407 --> 45:44.339
So how is this going to work?

45:44.408 --> 45:46.467
Simple. We go in.
We get what we want. We come out.

45:47.144 --> 45:50.671
Once we get in we will wear these to
cover our faces. Just in case.

45:50.748 --> 45:52.147
Will they have video cameras?

45:52.216 --> 45:54.616
Oh yes. But we ve taken care
of that. So don't worry.

45:54.685 --> 45:57.916
Everyone knows what to do,
so just do your job and we will all be fine.

45:57.988 --> 45:59.046
So don't worry.

45:59.690 --> 46:00.554
Be happy.

46:02.726 --> 46:03.249
Your gun.

46:03.494 --> 46:03.960
Thanks but no thanks.

46:04.027 --> 46:04.618
You re welcome.

46:17.174 --> 46:19.642
Just follow us. don't say anything.
It will go smooth.

46:20.110 --> 46:23.739
Just like the old days, eh?
Except its no longer the minimart. Yes?

51:23.353 --> 51:24.843
Eric no! I can open the vault!

51:24.921 --> 51:26.115
Shut the fuck up!

52:27.050 --> 52:29.416
don't you ever conflict with me
during work again! Do you hear!?

52:29.486 --> 52:31.215
You didn't have to
shoot any of them!

52:31.287 --> 52:35.087
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were
in charge now. Nobody told me.

52:35.191 --> 52:37.386
If he had opened the vault it
would have saved us a fucking hour.

52:37.460 --> 52:39.553
Eric. It's just that we've gone
from being thieves to murderers.

52:39.896 --> 52:44.094
Oh fuck it doesn't matter!
Here you get the death penalty
just for robbing a federal bank.

52:44.300 --> 52:45.927
I thought the death
penalty was abolished in 1980?

52:46.069 --> 52:48.037
Ohhhh! That's what
they tell you! But who cares?

52:48.671 --> 52:49.763
I need to take a piss.

52:49.839 --> 52:51.534
Why don't you open the vault?

58:38.888 --> 58:42.016
What is it?
What's going on?

58:46.295 --> 58:47.353
I don't know.

59:29.639 --> 59:30.663
Oh shit.

59:31.207 --> 59:34.233
Who gives a damn if they see us or not anyway!
I can't see a fucking think in this!

01:00:01.404 --> 01:00:05.101
This is insane!
I am a U.S. Citizen!

01:00:06.609 --> 01:00:08.668
I'm just here exchanging dollars.

01:00:16.218 --> 01:00:17.947
If it wasn't

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:20.518
for my country you'd all
be speaking German!

01:03:49.064 --> 01:03:49.860
What's going on?

01:03:50.599 --> 01:03:52.191
Nothing.

01:03:52.368 --> 01:03:54.097
They were just scaring them.

01:03:56.872 --> 01:03:58.134
Well, did you tell them
to stay quiet?

01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:02.208
Yes. They're assholes.
Just having fun.

01:04:07.616 --> 01:04:09.550
Its okay.
You can buy another one.

01:04:12.588 --> 01:04:13.714
Cross your fingers.

01:04:23.966 --> 01:04:26.662
Excellent.
What next?

01:04:26.936 --> 01:04:27.903
We find the fuse box.

01:04:28.771 --> 01:04:30.568
Its okay. I'll find it for you. No.
I need to see it myself.

01:04:31.307 --> 01:04:33.036
Close behind him.

01:04:33.108 --> 01:04:36.976
I think it would be better if
I looked for you. I could

01:04:37.046 --> 01:04:38.104
hold on.

01:04:41.784 --> 01:04:43.445
Here she is.

01:04:44.253 --> 01:04:49.190
Okay, you throw this fuse switch off and
then back on when I call to you.

01:04:49.358 --> 01:04:51.155
Any other switch
may set off the alarm.

01:04:52.428 --> 01:04:55.090
Oh, I wouldn't want to do that.

01:04:55.264 --> 01:04:55.889
Got it?

01:04:56.265 --> 01:04:56.856
Got it.

01:05:53.122 --> 01:05:53.747
Ready?!

01:05:55.157 --> 01:05:55.953
Now!

01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:08.329
It worked!

01:06:15.544 --> 01:06:17.671
Oh my god it worked!

01:06:25.888 --> 01:06:28.721
I can get through that lock in a minute.
Then do it. We don't have all day.
Dime store brand. Three minutes max. Good.

01:06:38.133 --> 01:06:38.929
Fuck!

01:06:43.172 --> 01:06:44.400
Another security guard?

01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:46.368
Must be.

01:06:51.447 --> 01:06:52.914
I think I stained my pants.

01:06:53.282 --> 01:06:54.772
Me too.

01:06:55.117 --> 01:06:57.278
What is it?!
I came down to see how

01:06:58.287 --> 01:07:00.517
things were going and heard shots!
Some asshole in the vault.

01:07:06.195 --> 01:07:06.820
We've got guns. Why don't we
just storm in and blast his fucking ass!
It's three against one! Let's give it the old

01:07:06.895 --> 01:07:07.657
quiet!

01:07:08.163 --> 01:07:09.061
I'm just trying to be helpful.

01:07:09.131 --> 01:07:10.758
Just let me think.

01:07:10.833 --> 01:07:12.391
You don't have to snap at me.

01:07:33.322 --> 01:07:34.880
What is this guys problem?

01:08:21.537 --> 01:08:22.196
What the hell are you doing?

01:08:28.042 --> 01:08:28.600
Okay

01:08:29.178 --> 01:08:32.773
that's too much.
Its dangerous.

01:08:32.848 --> 01:08:34.076
I like danger.

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.712
You asshole!
You could have killed us all.

01:09:47.788 --> 01:09:51.316
But I didn't!
Let's go check out the

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:52.852
damage.

01:09:56.865 --> 01:09:57.695
Zed look!

01:09:57.833 --> 01:10:00.097
I beat you!
I opened it in under three minutes.

01:10:04.973 --> 01:10:07.567
Go around and wait
at the main vault door.

01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:09.172
When I tell you, open it up.

01:10:10.412 --> 01:10:12.039
Right. When you tell me,
I'll open it up.

01:10:15.551 --> 01:10:17.348
I'll be at the other vault
waiting for you to call to me.

01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:49.442
We're all rich!

01:11:00.329 --> 01:11:01.057
Look at it!

01:11:30.058 --> 01:11:31.184
I'm going to show the others.

01:11:47.776 --> 01:11:48.743
We're rich!

01:11:51.346 --> 01:11:52.973
We're not out of here yet.

01:11:53.281 --> 01:11:55.476
Yes but We're rich!

01:17:42.464 --> 01:17:43.863
Oliver, now!
Open the vault!

01:18:41.256 --> 01:18:42.348
Do you want to give me a hand?

01:19:40.482 --> 01:19:42.074
Do you think
we should get some cash also?

01:19:44.285 --> 01:19:45.115
What for?

01:19:50.091 --> 01:19:51.786
Money is too easily traceable.

01:19:52.193 --> 01:19:53.660
You'd never be able to spend it.

01:19:54.596 --> 01:19:56.894
And forget about exchanging it.

01:19:57.799 --> 01:20:00.063
That's true.

01:21:11.539 --> 01:21:12.665
Do we have a covering
of some kind?

01:21:13.875 --> 01:21:14.603
A what?

01:21:17.679 --> 01:21:22.810
You know. Something to cover this with.
It'll look kind of conspicuous leaving

01:21:24.686 --> 01:21:28.383
the bank with a platten of gold.
Oh, it won't matter.
The police know what We're up too.

01:21:30.024 --> 01:21:30.854
Police?!

01:21:31.392 --> 01:21:32.381
You don't know?

01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.188
But eric has them under control.

01:21:33.928 --> 01:21:35.122
Zed is frantic.

01:21:35.196 --> 01:21:38.654
No I didn't know!
How many police?

01:22:05.126 --> 01:22:06.058
What the fuck are you doing!?

01:22:39.394 --> 01:22:41.988
Do you really love your bitch
whore girlfriend that much?

01:22:42.263 --> 01:22:43.662
She's really fucked
with your mind.

01:22:43.731 --> 01:22:45.096
Eric... what are you
talking about?

01:22:45.566 --> 01:22:47.796
Look at it.
Its all for us. The smoke.

01:22:48.136 --> 01:22:53.164
The attention. They have no idea
of who they're dealing with.

01:22:53.241 --> 01:22:55.232
They have no idea
what kind of men we are.

01:22:55.443 --> 01:22:58.435
What kind of men are we?

01:22:59.314 --> 01:23:01.009
You can no longer
be in our club.

01:23:02.417 --> 01:23:04.282
You forfeit your
cut of the pie.

01:23:06.454 --> 01:23:10.322
Zed laughs, there's not gonna be
much of a pie to eat.

01:23:11.292 --> 01:23:14.090
What about our friendship?

01:23:20.101 --> 01:23:22.194
Never let a girl
come between two men.

01:24:26.567 --> 01:24:27.261
Zoe...

01:24:31.639 --> 01:24:32.435
my zed.
They've hurt you.

01:24:44.619 --> 01:24:45.881
You're going to be okay.
In many

01:24:46.788 --> 01:24:49.052
through my cheek.

01:24:49.190 --> 01:24:50.452
The police are now laying it on heavy.
Francois comes out of

01:24:51.692 --> 01:24:52.556
the office.

01:24:58.533 --> 01:25:00.364
Oliver! Let's get a hostage!

01:25:01.769 --> 01:25:03.430
This is the end!

01:25:05.573 --> 01:25:06.335
Listen to me.
We're going to lock

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:14.477
ourselves into one of the air tight

01:25:18.286 --> 01:25:20.311
what about the others?

01:25:26.594 --> 01:25:30.792
Listen... there's no gunfire.

01:25:33.668 --> 01:25:34.396
The rear stairs to the lobby level.

01:25:43.578 --> 01:25:46.138
You wanna fuck with me?
You wanna fuck with me?
I'll show you who you're fucking with!

01:25:49.150 --> 01:25:52.677
He starts blasting away.
C'mon, we'll be safer in here.

01:26:20.081 --> 01:26:21.878
What's your girlfriends name?

01:26:22.617 --> 01:26:23.208
Zoe.

01:26:24.519 --> 01:26:25.349
Zoe.

01:26:27.421 --> 01:26:28.820
Zoey spits at him.

01:27:06.127 --> 01:27:07.492
Zed no. I'll kill you.

01:27:07.762 --> 01:27:10.356
It means nothing to me,
our friendship.

01:27:10.932 --> 01:27:13.162
Eric... there's no fucking
way out of here!

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:15.065
Oh but you're wrong.
This is my way out.

01:27:15.136 --> 01:27:17.604
This dime store couge
with her motor driven ass.

01:27:18.272 --> 01:27:19.500
You find your own.

01:27:19.874 --> 01:27:21.603
She tries to get away from
eric but he has a hold on her

01:27:23.678 --> 01:27:26.272
shirt. Come zed...
I'm going to cut you like a sausage.

01:27:26.447 --> 01:27:28.813
Did you see how she ran?
Did you see how

01:27:28.983 --> 01:27:33.044
she ran? She doesn't care about you.
Fucking pussy only cares about pussy.

01:27:35.756 --> 01:27:37.656
What do you say, zed?

01:27:41.629 --> 01:27:43.096
I will kill you.
And once I kill you

01:27:43.264 --> 01:27:44.458
what do you say to that zed?

01:27:45.933 --> 01:27:47.662
Fucking bitch!

01:28:47.094 --> 01:28:48.356
Ox! Where is thy yoke!?

01:28:49.330 --> 01:28:50.957
Fuck both of you.

01:29:07.548 --> 01:29:09.015
Au revoir.

01:29:22.263 --> 01:29:24.060
I give you little kiss. Ciao.

01:31:23.150 --> 01:31:24.048
The hospital?

01:31:26.453 --> 01:31:27.283
No.

01:31:28.622 --> 01:31:29.953
Come on.
I have a car.

01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:43.962
I'm so tired.

01:31:45.339 --> 01:31:46.829
We'll go to my flat.
You can rest there.

01:31:54.315 --> 01:31:55.475
Do you feel pain?

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:01.283
No... it was mostly his blood.

01:32:02.823 --> 01:32:03.812
I have a shower.

01:32:05.159 --> 01:32:06.524
You can clean up there.

01:32:11.599 --> 01:32:12.588
Thank you zoe.

01:32:14.568 --> 01:32:15.626
He looks at her.

01:32:16.704 --> 01:32:18.433
You'll get well. Then I'll show you
the real Paris. They drive away.
