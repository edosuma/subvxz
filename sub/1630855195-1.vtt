Just looking for Emma.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.931
She in?
Yeah.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.793
Emma's just there.
Thank you.

04:58.172 --> 05:00.379
Emma, I'm Detective
Sergeant Christie.

05:00.448 --> 05:03.000
Just wondering if we
could have a chat.

05:10.172 --> 05:11.620
This way, please, Emma.

05:11.689 --> 05:12.620
- Thank.
- Follow me.

05:26.241 --> 05:27.793
Hi, Emma.

05:27.862 --> 05:29.344
I'm Chief Inspector
Sarah Craven.

05:29.413 --> 05:31.137
I'm sorry to keep
you waiting today.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.448
It's OK.

05:32.517 --> 05:34.758
Sitting here is better
than wiping tables.

05:36.379 --> 05:40.931
So you're out here on
holidays from the UK, yeah?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.241
You're working at
Chrystal's Harbourside.

05:42.310 --> 05:44.413
I hear they make
a mean margarita.

05:44.482 --> 05:45.931
I know I'm not
supposed to be working.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.724
I did apply for a visa online.

05:47.793 --> 05:48.931
We're not interested in that.

05:51.862 --> 05:53.586
I spoke to the harbormaster.

05:53.655 --> 05:55.862
He suggested we track you down.

05:55.931 --> 06:00.310
He said you might be familiar
with a yacht called "The Blue."

06:00.379 --> 06:02.241
He reckons you've
been in three or four

06:02.310 --> 06:04.310
times a week asking after it.

06:04.379 --> 06:05.758
It was never
four times a week.

06:06.827 --> 06:07.931
Well, still.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.689
Seems you're anxious.

06:10.758 --> 06:12.551
I'm not-- I'm not anxious.

06:12.620 --> 06:15.344
I just knew that this was her
home port, and if, you know,

06:15.413 --> 06:17.034
they happen to
come this way,

06:17.103 --> 06:19.793
then it might be nice
to catch up.

06:19.862 --> 06:21.689
Oh, so you have
friends on board?

06:21.758 --> 06:24.965
No, I was backpacking in
the Philippines, and I--

06:25.034 --> 06:26.689
I met the crew in a bar.

06:26.758 --> 06:30.724
And we got on, so they asked
me to sail with them for a bit.

06:30.793 --> 06:32.137
And I did.

06:32.206 --> 06:36.137
But I got off the
boat like weeks ago.

06:40.620 --> 06:42.034
Has something happened?

06:42.103 --> 06:44.241
Look, 14 hours
ago a distress call

06:44.310 --> 06:46.896
was picked up from a vessel
identified as "The Blue."

06:46.965 --> 06:48.655
A search was undertaken.

06:48.724 --> 06:49.965
"The Blue" was found.

06:50.034 --> 06:52.724
It was perfectly
seaworthy but completely

06:52.793 --> 06:57.034
empty, no one on board.

06:57.103 --> 06:59.517
So what's happened to them?

06:59.586 --> 07:01.068
That's what we're
trying to find out.

07:01.137 --> 07:02.862
I have four people
who seem to have

07:02.931 --> 07:04.310
disappeared into thin air.

07:04.379 --> 07:06.068
We're gathering
information, anything that

07:06.137 --> 07:08.206
might help the search effort.

07:08.275 --> 07:10.758
So when you got
on board the boat,

07:10.827 --> 07:12.482
you were traveling alone, yeah?

07:12.551 --> 07:15.896
There's no one else you could
put us onto who might help?

07:15.965 --> 07:17.034
No.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.517
I was by myself.

07:18.586 --> 07:20.000
All right, Emma.

07:20.068 --> 07:21.034
Well, maybe we should
move on to the boat

07:21.103 --> 07:22.379
itself, safety standards.

07:22.448 --> 07:23.482
Lana!

07:27.586 --> 07:30.827
Lana.

07:30.896 --> 07:32.793
Ready?
Yeah

07:39.793 --> 07:41.103
Is that some sort of counter?

07:41.172 --> 07:42.655
OK, Bangkok flight.

07:42.724 --> 07:44.310
Over there.
Over there.

07:44.379 --> 07:45.379
It looks like it's going
to leave in like 35 minutes.

07:45.448 --> 07:46.448
Well, then--

07:46.517 --> 07:47.965
No, we're not
going to get on.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.551
- We have to hurry.
- We won't get on.

07:49.620 --> 07:50.931
Even if we buy a ticket
now, we're going to miss it.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.827
Keep sweeping.

07:52.896 --> 07:54.551
Keep an eye on departures.

07:54.620 --> 07:55.965
Just keep sweeping.

07:56.034 --> 07:59.482
Keep checking in with us.
Over.

07:59.551 --> 08:01.172
What do we do?

08:04.482 --> 08:05.586
OK, OK.

08:05.655 --> 08:07.758
Just come with me.

08:07.827 --> 08:12.517
The next departure after
that is 9:30 p.m. to Manila.

08:12.586 --> 08:14.793
Yeah, well,
then--yeah, we'll take it.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.068
Two, please.

08:16.137 --> 08:18.965
OK.
Two to Manila, return.

08:19.034 --> 08:20.620
No, no, no, one-way.

08:20.689 --> 08:21.655
One-way.
Thank you.

08:52.586 --> 08:54.689
We'll be landing in a
couple of hours, I think.

08:54.758 --> 08:57.965
And what then?

08:58.034 --> 09:02.344
We keep moving,
get as far away as we can.

09:07.517 --> 09:10.172
What if this was a mistake?

09:10.241 --> 09:13.517
No. It won't be.

09:20.517 --> 09:25.655
I'm scared.

09:25.724 --> 09:29.517
That stuff back home--
you have to forget about.

09:29.586 --> 09:34.103
Because we're going to be far
away, and we'll be together.

09:34.172 --> 09:36.379
I'll keep us safe.

09:36.448 --> 09:39.689
Promise.

09:39.758 --> 09:42.000
And you got to stop crying.

09:42.068 --> 09:45.586

12:07.586 --> 12:09.413
the one that tried
to chat me up,

12:09.482 --> 12:12.413
he said that snorkeling in
Palawan is like mind-blowing.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.655
Kit, you fucking
hate the sea.

12:14.724 --> 12:15.655
No, I don't.

12:15.724 --> 12:16.689
Yes, you do.

12:16.758 --> 12:18.413
Yeah, maybe a bit.

12:18.482 --> 12:21.241
But if I drown,
you'll just fish me out.

12:21.310 --> 12:24.103
Sorry, madam, but there is a
problem with your credit card.

12:26.655 --> 12:27.896
Sorry?

12:27.965 --> 12:30.689
Yes, your card--
it has been declined.

12:30.758 --> 12:31.793
Really?

12:31.862 --> 12:33.310
I-- I mean, that's a bit--

12:33.379 --> 12:35.068
I used it this morning,
and it-- and it-- and it

12:35.137 --> 12:37.586
worked fine, so.

12:37.655 --> 12:39.724
Perhaps you
have another card.

12:39.793 --> 12:43.344
How do we know it's not
your machine that's broken?

12:43.413 --> 12:46.137
I will try running
it through once more.

12:46.206 --> 12:47.137
Thanks.

12:47.206 --> 12:48.206
Thanks.

13:02.103 --> 13:03.103
We need to try
the other card.

13:03.172 --> 13:04.310
What the fuck has happened?

13:04.379 --> 13:05.379
- Maybe we maxed it out.
- No!

13:05.448 --> 13:06.379
No, I didn't.

13:06.448 --> 13:07.620
I kept track.

13:18.620 --> 13:22.034
Come on.
Come on.

13:22.103 --> 13:23.931
I said if we used
her card this was

13:24.000 --> 13:25.241
going to happen eventually.

13:25.310 --> 13:26.827
Well, what are
we supposed to do?

13:26.896 --> 13:28.275
We need to move.

13:28.344 --> 13:29.896
We need to get as far
away from here as--

13:29.965 --> 13:31.758
But we have no money.

13:31.827 --> 13:34.241
There's some cash hidden
in my shoe back at the hotel.

13:34.310 --> 13:35.862
What if the police
are waiting for us?

13:44.517 --> 13:46.448
That guy I shagged,
that Swedish guy,

13:46.517 --> 13:49.275
he said he has a place in--

13:49.344 --> 13:50.517
in-- in-- in Mindanao.

13:50.586 --> 13:54.896
We'd never find it.

13:54.965 --> 13:55.931
Here, here.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.793
Look.

13:57.862 --> 13:58.862
He said I could stay.

13:58.931 --> 14:00.448
- You.
- No, no.

14:00.517 --> 14:01.793
He would let us both stay.

14:01.862 --> 14:03.827
If I-- if I asked
him, he would.

14:03.896 --> 14:05.000
Mindanao's a
different island.

14:05.068 --> 14:06.034
We'd need to get a ferry.

14:06.103 --> 14:08.000
No.

14:08.068 --> 14:11.482
We chance the hotel, grab
your cash, flop at his place,

14:11.551 --> 14:13.620
and-- and get bar work.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.517
Look.

14:49.586 --> 14:52.965
There's enough in here
to get ferry to Mindanao.

14:53.034 --> 14:55.965
What's that?

15:00.758 --> 15:03.000
Maybe we don't need a ferry.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.517
Excuse me!

15:04.586 --> 15:06.655
A guy over there said he
might be able to help us.

15:06.724 --> 15:09.034
Could you point us
in the direction

15:09.103 --> 15:11.310
of a boat named "The Blue"?

15:11.379 --> 15:14.689
They all look the same to me.

15:14.758 --> 15:15.689
Yeah.

15:15.758 --> 15:17.551
Yeah, I-- I guess I know her.

15:38.793 --> 15:40.689
The skipper doesn't
like the marina crowd,

15:40.758 --> 15:44.068
so he usually moors
further out

15:44.137 --> 15:46.827
away from the wankers.

16:19.896 --> 16:23.275
Michelle!

16:23.344 --> 16:25.655
You've got visitors.

16:25.724 --> 16:30.137
Are you Michelle Wilson?

16:30.206 --> 16:34.482
We found this on the
street in the old town.

16:34.551 --> 16:37.827
We were gonna hand
it to the police,

16:37.896 --> 16:40.068
but we found this
old ticket thing.

16:40.137 --> 16:45.241
So we figured if we found the
boat on the ticket, then yeah.

16:45.310 --> 16:47.172
Fuck.
Thank you.

16:47.241 --> 16:48.413
Thanks.

16:48.482 --> 16:49.517
The money's gone.

16:49.586 --> 16:51.137
Jesus, who cares?

16:51.206 --> 16:52.413
I mean, they brought it back.

16:52.482 --> 16:53.724
That's all that matters.

16:53.793 --> 16:54.517
Thanks.

16:54.586 --> 16:56.172
It's all good.

16:56.241 --> 16:59.448
Yeah, so this is Kitty.

16:59.517 --> 17:01.517
This is Lana.

17:01.586 --> 17:03.172
Joseph.

17:03.241 --> 17:04.448
This is Denny.

17:04.517 --> 17:06.482
Michelle you already met.

17:06.551 --> 17:07.655
Hey, Aaron.

17:07.724 --> 17:09.068
Come up here.

17:09.137 --> 17:10.965
Yeah?

17:11.034 --> 17:12.655
Skipper,
these two found my wallet,

17:12.724 --> 17:14.413
my-- my license, credit cards.

17:14.482 --> 17:17.103
It's all there.

17:17.172 --> 17:19.137
Stroke of luck.

17:19.206 --> 17:20.586
Yeah.

17:20.655 --> 17:22.965
Well, we know what it's
like to get robbed.

17:24.517 --> 17:26.206
Don't we, Lana?

17:26.275 --> 17:28.931
Just after we arrived,
this guy offered us a lift,

17:29.000 --> 17:30.586
and then we put our
bags in his car.

17:30.655 --> 17:32.344
And then he just drove off.

17:32.413 --> 17:33.482
We lost everything.

17:33.551 --> 17:35.206
Well, that sucks, right?

17:35.275 --> 17:39.620
Yeah, it was a bit of a
bummer on the dream holiday.

17:39.689 --> 17:43.103
Maybe we can do
something to help.

17:44.724 --> 17:46.724
Yeah, well, I don't know if
you're going this way but we

17:46.793 --> 17:50.275
really need to get to
Mindanao, and-- and a lift

17:50.344 --> 17:52.689
would be huge.

17:55.482 --> 18:00.931
Well, it just so happens you
are in time for Happy Hour.

18:01.000 --> 18:01.931
Here.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.068
Oh.

18:04.137 --> 18:06.551
Start there, shall we?

18:06.620 --> 18:07.896
See how we go.

18:07.965 --> 18:10.862
Cheers.

18:13.137 --> 18:15.310
This is the crew
list from the last port

18:15.379 --> 18:17.068
of departure in the Solomons.

18:17.137 --> 18:19.275
So if you could just give us
your impressions of the people

18:19.344 --> 18:22.379
that you sailed with, Emma,
then that'd be a big help.

18:22.448 --> 18:23.689
Michelle Wilson?

18:23.758 --> 18:26.793
She's American.

18:26.862 --> 18:29.793
She's smart, like
university smart--

18:29.862 --> 18:31.034
everyone calls her Chelle--

18:31.103 --> 18:34.862
and kind too.

18:36.620 --> 18:37.689
Heinrich Krause?

18:37.758 --> 18:38.793
He fixes things.

18:38.862 --> 18:40.413
He's sort of like the mechanic.

18:40.482 --> 18:43.068
He's a bit of a lad,
always telling stupid jokes.

18:45.172 --> 18:47.586
Dennis Winbourne?

18:49.827 --> 18:52.689
Isn't that Aaron's brother?

18:58.206 --> 18:59.620
I don't know what
else you want me to say.

18:59.689 --> 19:03.172
He-- he was just a guy.

19:03.241 --> 19:04.551
Animal noises.

19:04.620 --> 19:05.931
Ooh-ooh, ah-ah.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.931
Cock-a-doodle-do,
cock-a-doodle-do!

19:09.000 --> 19:10.310
Rawr!

19:10.379 --> 19:11.551
Bah!

19:12.827 --> 19:14.172
Jellyfish?
Who's that?

19:14.241 --> 19:17.137
- That's not a Jellyfish!
- That's you!

19:23.689 --> 19:25.000
Get it, get it, get it.
Ooh!

19:25.068 --> 19:26.310
Don't you waste my good rum!

19:26.379 --> 19:27.310
Oh my God!

19:27.379 --> 19:28.344
It's overrated.

19:28.413 --> 19:30.241
Don't worry.

19:30.310 --> 19:31.275
OK, OK.

19:31.344 --> 19:32.620
It's me, right?

19:32.689 --> 19:34.620
Listen, never have
I-- never have

19:34.689 --> 19:36.275
I ever been in a three-way.

19:36.344 --> 19:37.275
Show me.

19:38.379 --> 19:39.620
Guilty as charged.

19:39.689 --> 19:41.103
No?
Never?

19:41.172 --> 19:42.103
Are you serious?

19:42.172 --> 19:43.379
I'm serious.

19:43.448 --> 19:45.275
I-- I thought you done
three-way, four-way.

19:45.344 --> 19:46.655
I don't know.
Five-way?

19:46.724 --> 19:47.965
Five-way?
No.

19:48.034 --> 19:49.482
No.

19:49.551 --> 19:50.655
I'm-- I'm old-fashioned.

19:50.724 --> 19:53.344
He's a gentleman.

19:53.413 --> 19:54.344
I am a gentleman.

19:54.413 --> 19:55.724
Unlike you.

19:55.793 --> 19:59.241
Mr. Winbourne,
I believe you're up.

19:59.310 --> 20:01.000
What about you?

20:01.068 --> 20:03.310
You haven't drunk all night.

20:03.379 --> 20:04.586
I am drinking.

20:04.655 --> 20:06.413
Ah, but not in the game.

20:06.482 --> 20:08.310
That's because
I'm not playing.

20:08.379 --> 20:09.586
You set down to play.

20:10.655 --> 20:13.206
Shh.

20:16.827 --> 20:18.379
Come on, Aaron.

20:18.448 --> 20:19.586
If she doesn't want to
drink, don't make her drink.

20:19.655 --> 20:20.655
No.

20:20.724 --> 20:22.068
Not everyone-- no drama.

20:22.137 --> 20:23.620
You want in?
All in.

20:23.689 --> 20:24.655
OK.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.206
New game.
Yeah!

20:26.275 --> 20:27.793
Whoa.

20:27.862 --> 20:31.172
the new game is, who's
most likely to, so who's--

20:31.241 --> 20:34.103
who's most likely
to be a virgin and--

20:34.172 --> 20:36.413
Heinrich!

20:36.482 --> 20:38.206
Who's most likely to lose?

20:38.275 --> 20:39.310
Heinrich!

20:39.379 --> 20:40.413
Ah!
Show us, show us.

20:40.482 --> 20:41.448
Heinrich!

20:41.517 --> 20:42.793
Take it off!

20:42.862 --> 20:44.517
- Take it off!
- Come on.

20:44.586 --> 20:45.931
Come on, Heinrich.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.896
- Rock the boat!
- Rock the boat!

20:47.965 --> 20:49.517

No, I was just
looking for the loo.

23:26.827 --> 23:30.517
Well, do you think
it's in my cabin?

23:34.517 --> 23:36.413
Well, come.
I'll show you something.

23:49.965 --> 23:53.344
How come you get a free
pass on all the games?

23:53.413 --> 23:54.379
Not free.

23:54.448 --> 23:57.862
Believe me, I pay.

23:57.931 --> 23:59.758
What's that?

23:59.827 --> 24:02.517
Absinthe.

24:04.517 --> 24:06.413
Is it going to make me
trip out or something?

24:07.448 --> 24:08.931
No.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.827
It's just a myth.

24:10.896 --> 24:13.241
It's just alcohol.

24:14.137 --> 24:16.655
That's a lot of fuss
if it's just booze?

24:16.724 --> 24:22.862
Well, I like fuss.

24:29.517 --> 24:31.241
Did you paint that?

24:37.896 --> 24:39.551
Every boat needs an artist.

24:41.655 --> 24:42.724
Are you Filipino?

24:42.793 --> 24:46.793
Uh, my-- my dad is Filipino.

24:46.862 --> 24:49.068
And my mom is French.

24:51.448 --> 24:54.931
But back home in
France, I'm Asian,

24:55.000 --> 24:57.103
and here in Asia, I'm French.

24:57.172 --> 24:59.275
I don't know, so you tell me.

25:04.551 --> 25:07.172
You're all from
different countries then?

25:09.724 --> 25:11.275
She's Aaron's boat.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.068
The rest of us-- we joined
from different places,

25:13.137 --> 25:16.241
people he meets along the way.

25:18.137 --> 25:20.965
How old are you?

25:21.034 --> 25:22.793
25.

25:22.862 --> 25:25.137
Bullshit.

25:25.206 --> 25:26.965
You're bullshit.

25:28.482 --> 25:31.206
Well, English girls
who travel this way,

25:31.275 --> 25:33.275
most go straight to Phuket,

25:33.344 --> 25:35.896
get fucked up
at the Full Moon Party.

25:35.965 --> 25:38.793
Yet you're in the Philippines.

25:38.862 --> 25:40.241
Why?

25:43.551 --> 25:46.413
I don't know.

25:46.482 --> 25:47.931
Why are you?

25:48.000 --> 25:51.689
I'm running away.

25:51.758 --> 25:53.310
Aren't we all?

26:03.034 --> 26:09.000
Mm. Oh, fuck.

26:09.068 --> 26:12.793
♪ All that I wanted, yeah ♪

26:38.517 --> 26:41.448
Ugh.

26:52.310 --> 26:53.482
Kit.
Kitty.

26:53.551 --> 26:54.482
Oh!

26:54.551 --> 26:56.448
Sorry.

26:56.517 --> 26:58.137
Fuck.

26:58.206 --> 26:59.620
We sailed off.

26:59.689 --> 27:01.000
What?

27:01.068 --> 27:02.655
We're in the
middle of the sea.

27:07.172 --> 27:10.931
I don't even remember
falling asleep.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.275
God, where the fuck are we?

27:32.172 --> 27:35.241
- Stop.
- Sorry, where are we?

27:35.310 --> 27:37.827
On our way to
beautiful Mindanao.

27:37.896 --> 27:40.241
Hope that's OK.

27:40.310 --> 27:42.241
Yeah, that's great.

27:42.310 --> 27:45.275
Yeah, we got a stop off
in Balakid first, pick up

27:45.344 --> 27:46.793
some supplies for New Year's.

27:46.862 --> 27:48.448
Then we're going to head
down the coast a bit,

27:48.517 --> 27:50.034
do a bit of island-hopping.

27:50.103 --> 27:51.655
I'm sure young
Joseph here would

27:51.724 --> 27:53.931
be happy to drop in town.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.517
Or you could just stay on.

27:57.586 --> 27:58.517
Wait.

27:58.586 --> 27:59.724
What?

27:59.793 --> 28:01.275
Do you mean go on
island hopping with you?

28:01.344 --> 28:03.000
Call it our way
of saying thank you for

28:03.068 --> 28:04.862
returning the wallet.

28:10.517 --> 28:13.482
So is that a yes?

28:16.379 --> 28:17.827
Yeah.

28:17.896 --> 28:20.655
- Great.
- Great.

28:20.724 --> 28:22.793
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Sounds good.

28:32.068 --> 28:33.068
Yeah.

28:36.689 --> 28:39.206
There are a few
rules on this boat, OK?

28:39.275 --> 28:41.931
On "The Blue," everything
is held collectively.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.482
All work is shared,
and we all contribute equally.

28:44.551 --> 28:45.793
OK?

28:45.862 --> 28:50.862
That means $50 a week
each for expenses.

28:50.931 --> 28:52.034
Yeah, that sounds fair.

28:52.103 --> 28:53.310
All right.

28:53.379 --> 28:55.172
This will be you.

28:55.241 --> 28:58.034
Mm, it's nice.

28:58.103 --> 29:04.344
Yeah, she's a great old
boat, a little bit creaky.

29:04.413 --> 29:07.448
She leaves a small wake.

29:07.517 --> 29:09.137
You sail on her, I expect
you to do the same.

29:09.206 --> 29:10.689
OK?
We don't waste.

29:10.758 --> 29:11.551
We don't pollute.

29:11.620 --> 29:13.655
And we do not exploit.

29:13.724 --> 29:15.931
That was totally
our philosophy.

29:18.034 --> 29:19.413
OK.

29:19.482 --> 29:23.310
Secondly, all decisions
are made by via a vote.

29:23.379 --> 29:24.793
Except when safety's concerned.

29:24.862 --> 29:26.137
Then I'm in charge,
no questions asked.

29:26.206 --> 29:27.448
Yeah.

29:27.517 --> 29:28.862
I mean,
it's your boat, so sure.

29:28.931 --> 29:29.931
Yeah.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.586
Lastly, and the most important.

29:31.655 --> 29:32.931
No sex on board.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.413
All right?

29:34.482 --> 29:35.724
You want to screw,
you find someone on shore.

29:37.310 --> 29:39.896
Because my crew do not
screw, at least not each other.

29:42.620 --> 29:44.862
Lana?

29:44.931 --> 29:46.586
That's fine.

29:46.655 --> 29:47.620
Good.

29:47.689 --> 29:49.241
OK, well, settle yourselves in.

29:49.310 --> 29:50.689
Dinner's at six.

29:50.758 --> 29:52.310
Thank you.

29:52.379 --> 29:53.931
Treat my boat right, OK?

29:54.000 --> 29:55.758
Don't waste freshwater.

29:55.827 --> 29:57.689
I'll stay happy.

29:57.758 --> 29:58.896
Enjoy.

30:00.448 --> 30:02.103
- Did you see--
- Get off.

30:02.172 --> 30:04.206
Did you see
he's got a ring on his finger?

30:04.275 --> 30:06.000
Yeah, because he's married.

30:06.068 --> 30:07.344
He's a married man.

30:08.931 --> 30:10.758
Where's is his wife then?

30:10.827 --> 30:13.000
Kit, put it away.

30:13.068 --> 30:16.379
Apparently there were
signs of trouble on board,

30:16.448 --> 30:17.965
a fight maybe.

30:18.034 --> 30:21.620
Can you think of anything
that may have caused that?

30:21.689 --> 30:23.724
- Like what?
- I don't know.

30:23.793 --> 30:25.206
I wasn't there.

30:25.275 --> 30:26.896
Maybe something
didn't feel right,

30:26.965 --> 30:29.758
something someone said or did.

30:32.310 --> 30:33.482
Listen, Emma.

30:33.551 --> 30:35.034
If the crew are
in the water, they

30:35.103 --> 30:37.482
have a maximum of 48
hours before they succumb

30:37.551 --> 30:39.275
to hypothermia,
so if there's anything

30:39.344 --> 30:40.724
that you can think of--

30:40.793 --> 30:42.758
I don't know what you
want me to tell you.

30:42.827 --> 30:46.413
They were just a bunch of
travelers having a laugh.

30:55.172 --> 30:57.586
I've put some money away
to cover a week on the boat.

30:57.655 --> 31:01.275
That should get us clothes,
swimsuits, seasick meds.

31:01.344 --> 31:03.000
Won't that leave
us skint again?

31:03.068 --> 31:05.103
I can't keep wearing this.

31:05.172 --> 31:06.862
We're on Mindanao, OK?

31:06.931 --> 31:10.034
We can save the money, get away
tonight before they get back.

31:10.103 --> 31:11.482
No, no.

31:11.551 --> 31:13.172
Lan, on that boat we're
completely off the grid.

31:13.241 --> 31:14.137
For like a week.

31:15.655 --> 31:16.689
Yeah, in a week we'll
be way down south,

31:16.758 --> 31:18.413
like hundreds of
miles from here.

31:18.482 --> 31:20.172
Don't we need a proper plan,

31:20.241 --> 31:21.827
like for what
happens after that?

31:21.896 --> 31:23.551
Ugh, why?

31:23.620 --> 31:25.827
Sooner or later we're
going to get caught.

31:25.896 --> 31:27.931
With no money,
it's probably sooner.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
No.

31:29.068 --> 31:30.586
I won't let that happen.

31:30.655 --> 31:34.586
I know, but island-hopping
through Southeast Asia

31:34.655 --> 31:36.689
on a private bloody
yacht-- that's like

31:36.758 --> 31:39.724
someone else's like life,
someone much luckier than us.

31:39.793 --> 31:41.379
I want to enjoy it
while we can.

31:41.448 --> 31:44.241
Please.
Please.

31:53.827 --> 31:57.137
both: Woo!

31:57.206 --> 31:58.241
Woo!

32:08.103 --> 32:09.172
It's over there.

32:19.689 --> 32:23.517
OK, so you can grab the meds.

32:23.586 --> 32:25.000
Maybe I'll get us
some new clothes,

32:25.068 --> 32:28.000
and then we can meet back
here in 30 minutes?

32:28.068 --> 32:29.275
Cool.

32:29.344 --> 32:30.586
Are you listening to me?

32:30.655 --> 32:31.620
Yes, I am listening.

32:31.689 --> 32:33.034
OK.

32:33.103 --> 32:34.275
See you in a bit.

32:34.344 --> 32:35.310
Bye.

32:35.379 --> 32:37.965
Be safe.

34:12.448 --> 34:15.068
Lana.

34:15.137 --> 34:16.379
Denny.

34:16.448 --> 34:18.275
Here.

34:18.344 --> 34:19.413
Hey, what's up?

34:20.758 --> 34:21.724
The police were shooting
back there.

34:21.793 --> 34:22.862
I don't know what's going on.

34:22.931 --> 34:23.758
Yeah, I heard.

34:23.827 --> 34:25.034
We better get out of here.

34:25.103 --> 34:26.620
- I need to find Kitty.
- Hey, hey.

34:26.689 --> 34:28.206
She would have gone
back to the boat.

34:28.275 --> 34:29.793
What if she hasn't?
What if she's gotten lost?

34:29.862 --> 34:30.862
Then I'll go out
myself and find her.

34:30.931 --> 34:32.206
I promise.

34:32.275 --> 34:33.275
But those cops aren't
good people, so we've

34:33.344 --> 34:37.000
really got to move now.

34:42.068 --> 34:45.586
So were you just meeting up
with an old mate back there?

34:45.655 --> 34:48.965
Yeah, kind of.

34:49.034 --> 34:49.965
All right.

34:50.034 --> 34:51.793
I was picking up a bit of weed.

34:51.862 --> 34:53.655
Sometimes when my shift
ends it's hard to wind down,

34:53.724 --> 34:55.103
and a smoke helps.

34:55.172 --> 34:56.172
But--

34:56.241 --> 34:57.241
Aaron wouldn't like that.

34:57.310 --> 34:59.310
This way.

34:59.379 --> 35:00.482
Particularly not from me.

35:00.551 --> 35:03.103
From me, he expects more.

35:05.793 --> 35:07.310
It's just a big
brother thing, I guess,

35:07.379 --> 35:09.793
a bit like you and Kitty.

35:09.862 --> 35:10.931
She's not my big sister.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.206
Yeah, but she acts it, right?

35:12.275 --> 35:15.586
Like she's always in charge?

35:15.655 --> 35:16.793
It's not like that.

35:16.862 --> 35:18.241
Hey, look, I get it.

35:18.310 --> 35:19.931
You two are close,
just like me and Aaron.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.655
But sometimes you got
to do your own thing,

35:21.724 --> 35:23.586
you know, at bit of
time on your own.

35:23.655 --> 35:25.068
Yeah.

35:25.137 --> 35:28.241
Don't worry, I'm not
going to grass you up.

35:28.310 --> 35:31.689
Never thought you would.

35:31.758 --> 35:33.137
By the way, those earrings--

35:33.206 --> 35:34.344
I feel like I've seen
them somewhere before.

35:35.827 --> 35:37.034
Yeah, I-- I was going
to give them back.

35:37.103 --> 35:38.655
I was just borrowing them.
Don't worry.

35:38.724 --> 35:41.793
I don't grass either.

35:53.931 --> 35:56.275
I thought you'd been shot.

35:56.344 --> 35:59.275
And if you weren't shot,
you know, you'd be lost.

35:59.344 --> 36:00.344
I was.

36:00.413 --> 36:01.482
Denny found me.

36:01.551 --> 36:03.379
Well, hooray for the Denny.

36:03.448 --> 36:04.724
All right.

36:04.793 --> 36:05.896
I'm on dinner
shift, so unless you

36:05.965 --> 36:07.206
want to see Aaron
blow a circuit,

36:07.275 --> 36:08.586
we've got to get back.

36:08.655 --> 36:10.103
I just blown away by how
you guys get around.

36:10.172 --> 36:12.344
I always look like a
dumb, dumbass tourist.

36:12.413 --> 36:14.551
You are
a dumbass tourist.

36:14.620 --> 36:19.103
That was rude.

36:19.172 --> 36:22.413
So what did you guys get up to?

36:22.482 --> 36:23.482
- Today?
- Yeah.

36:55.137 --> 36:57.551
Ahh!

37:09.620 --> 37:10.620
Hello.

37:10.689 --> 37:12.310
Are you all right?

37:12.379 --> 37:16.241
Thank you.

37:19.103 --> 37:23.103
Sometimes I-- I wonder
why I stay on this boat.

37:28.137 --> 37:31.724
Then I see a view
like this, and I know.

37:36.034 --> 37:38.068
Lana, hey, Aaron
wants me to give you

37:38.137 --> 37:40.241
a lesson in helming the boat.

37:41.724 --> 37:43.896
Like steering it?

37:43.965 --> 37:46.172
It'll be painless.

37:46.241 --> 37:50.413
Come on.

37:55.241 --> 37:57.103
All right.

37:57.172 --> 37:58.793
You ready?

37:58.862 --> 38:02.620
First you flick that.

38:02.689 --> 38:03.793
- Should I do it?
- Yeah.

38:03.862 --> 38:04.793
Engine on.

38:06.310 --> 38:08.655
Let it warm up.

38:08.724 --> 38:11.689
Very good.

38:11.758 --> 38:14.758
You want to honk the horn?

38:14.827 --> 38:16.275
Go on.

38:16.344 --> 38:17.862
OK.

38:19.482 --> 38:22.413
A bit longer.

38:23.931 --> 38:27.620
Perfect.
All right, now put into gear.

38:27.689 --> 38:29.965
- OK.
- You see where we are?

38:30.034 --> 38:32.103
♪ Why is it so ♪

38:32.172 --> 38:33.724
OK, ocean navigation
for dummies.

38:33.793 --> 38:35.448
So right now,
it's on autopilot,

38:35.517 --> 38:37.241
so there's not much to do.

38:37.310 --> 38:40.793
But I'm going to turn that off
and give you a feel for it.

38:40.862 --> 38:43.172
Yeah, but what if I crash?

38:43.241 --> 38:45.413
Into what?

38:45.482 --> 38:46.689
You ready?

38:46.758 --> 38:48.448
- Yeah.
- It's off.

38:48.517 --> 38:49.482
You got it?

38:49.551 --> 38:51.724
Quick. Quick.

38:51.793 --> 38:53.241
- OK.
- All right.

38:53.310 --> 38:58.000
So first thing-- she steers a
lot slower than a car.

38:58.068 --> 38:59.689
I don't know how to
drive a car either.

38:59.758 --> 39:01.206
Oh, great.

39:01.275 --> 39:02.862
You don't have any
bad habits to unlearn.

39:02.931 --> 39:04.068
Keep your eye on the island.

39:04.137 --> 39:07.931
♪ Why is it so rotten? ♪

39:09.862 --> 39:12.517
Left.

39:12.586 --> 39:14.551
Yeah, you've got it.

39:14.620 --> 39:15.620
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

39:15.689 --> 39:17.103
Ooh,
it's pulling to the left.

39:17.172 --> 39:19.965
♪ Straight to
the heart with a toy ♪

39:20.034 --> 39:22.724
Spin, spin, spin.

39:22.793 --> 39:23.724
That's it.

39:23.793 --> 39:25.379
It's not a car.

39:25.448 --> 39:27.551
It's nothing like a car,

39:27.620 --> 39:29.896
especially this boat.

39:29.965 --> 39:31.724
All right.
Now we're good.

39:31.793 --> 39:32.896
You're just going to go left.

39:38.724 --> 39:40.344
All right, we're straight.

39:44.172 --> 39:45.827
Do you get signal out here?

39:45.896 --> 39:47.517
A couple of bars.

39:47.586 --> 39:48.551
There's a town over there.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.241
Do you want another drink?

39:55.310 --> 39:56.310
I'm good.

39:56.379 --> 39:57.344
Yeah?

39:57.413 --> 40:00.000
- No.
- OK.

40:56.448 --> 40:59.310
So, Joseph, your
family's religious then?

40:59.379 --> 41:05.034
My father is Catholic, very
Catholic, like many Filipinos.

41:05.103 --> 41:07.655
Before the church came here,
people

41:07.724 --> 41:09.931
used to worship spirits.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.068
Spirits?

41:11.137 --> 41:13.241
Like, what, ghosts?

41:13.310 --> 41:16.068
More like nature gods,
but there is

41:16.137 --> 41:18.655
one island on that coast
that was meant to be

41:18.724 --> 41:20.896
a bridge to the afterlife.

41:20.965 --> 41:22.448
Dayang?

41:24.310 --> 41:28.000
I went out there once
with this local guy.

41:28.068 --> 41:30.344
He wouldn't even
get off the boat.

41:30.413 --> 41:31.689
I did.

41:31.758 --> 41:34.137
But he warned me not
to bring anything back

41:34.206 --> 41:36.827
or I might take
the curse with me.

41:36.896 --> 41:38.931
Did you bring anything back?

41:39.965 --> 41:45.103
A beautiful conch too
irresistible to leave behind.

41:45.172 --> 41:46.620
Where's the conch now?

41:46.689 --> 41:48.517
I gave it to
Heinrich for Christmas,

41:48.586 --> 41:51.862
but I don't think it's
really affected him at all.

41:53.862 --> 41:55.724
- Oh!
- Ah!

41:57.586 --> 41:58.517
Whew!

41:58.586 --> 41:59.620
OK.

41:59.689 --> 42:01.689
So evil and unnecessary.

42:01.758 --> 42:06.551
All right, so you
now give it a spin.

42:06.620 --> 42:07.655
And--

42:07.724 --> 42:09.827
Den, where are we, mate?

42:09.896 --> 42:10.931
Oh, shit, sorry.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.689
I was giving Lana a lesson.

42:12.758 --> 42:14.275
We might have strayed a bit.

42:14.344 --> 42:15.896
A bit?

42:15.965 --> 42:17.413
We've gone out, out, out, out.
Sorry.

42:17.482 --> 42:18.758
Sorry.

42:18.827 --> 42:19.862
Look, we're 45 degrees
off the course I set.

42:19.931 --> 42:20.896
Come on.

42:20.965 --> 42:22.413
How do I know?

42:22.482 --> 42:27.103
Jesus.

42:27.172 --> 42:30.379
Guys, there's a
weird light over there.

42:41.275 --> 42:43.517
Funny flash pattern.

42:43.586 --> 42:45.034
What does that mean?

42:45.103 --> 42:46.137
A light flashing in
a particular sequence

42:46.206 --> 42:47.241
can be a message.

42:47.310 --> 42:49.724
Emergency signal, for instance.

42:53.655 --> 42:55.931
Better check it out.

43:09.689 --> 43:12.137
Trawler, trawler,
this is yacht "The Blue."

43:12.206 --> 43:13.344
Do you copy?

43:13.413 --> 43:14.862
Over.

43:14.931 --> 43:17.965
Trawler, trawler, trawler,
this is yacht "The Blue."

43:18.034 --> 43:18.931
Do you copy?

43:19.000 --> 43:20.689
Over.

43:20.758 --> 43:22.517
Hey!
Hey!

43:23.931 --> 43:24.931
Do you copy?

43:26.103 --> 43:28.034
Over.

43:31.655 --> 43:33.931
Hey!

43:34.000 --> 43:36.655
No response, Chelle?

43:36.724 --> 43:38.137
Do you see anyone?

43:38.206 --> 43:39.172
Why would it just
be sitting out here

43:39.241 --> 43:40.344
in the middle of nowhere?

43:40.413 --> 43:41.655
Hey!

43:41.724 --> 43:43.896
Maybe it was towed
there or something.

43:43.965 --> 43:45.758
- Why would they do that?
- No idea.

43:45.827 --> 43:46.896
Your guess is as good as mine.

43:46.965 --> 43:49.206
Let's take a look.

43:49.275 --> 43:51.344
Denny, is it-- what--

43:51.413 --> 43:53.034
oh my God.
You're insane.

43:53.103 --> 43:54.137
What--

43:54.206 --> 43:56.103
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

43:58.620 --> 44:00.172
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

44:02.758 --> 44:05.034
Den-Den, what the
fuck are you doing?

44:05.103 --> 44:07.517
Taking a look.

44:11.172 --> 44:13.137
They're insane.

44:13.206 --> 44:14.620
What if there's sharks
or-- or jellyfish?

44:14.689 --> 44:16.413
Wait, wait.
What are you doing?

44:16.482 --> 44:17.793
Lana?

44:17.862 --> 44:20.655
Lana!

44:20.724 --> 44:23.758
Lana, what are you doing?

44:23.827 --> 44:25.965
I wanna see what's going on.

44:26.034 --> 44:27.724
Why?

45:41.586 --> 45:42.517
Denny?

45:42.586 --> 45:44.793
Heinrich?

46:02.551 --> 46:05.034
Hey.

46:05.103 --> 46:06.655
What did you find?

46:10.137 --> 46:11.448
Lana.

46:37.862 --> 46:39.344
Help them up, Michelle.

47:01.241 --> 47:04.758
What's going on?

47:24.551 --> 47:26.517
What the fuck is this?

47:26.586 --> 47:28.689
Is that even real?

47:28.758 --> 47:30.241
Rick found it one
of the deck lockers.

47:30.310 --> 47:32.413
Yeah, so what?

47:32.482 --> 47:34.586
So you just took it?

47:34.655 --> 47:36.551
Well, couldn't leave it.

47:36.620 --> 47:38.655
Yeah.
Yeah, you could.

47:41.103 --> 47:43.103
Skipper, that boat
is completely empty.

47:43.172 --> 47:44.689
I mean, there's like not
even the engine inside.

47:44.758 --> 47:46.068
He's right.

47:46.137 --> 47:47.172
It looks like it's been
that way for years.

47:47.241 --> 47:48.137
- Really?
- Yes.

47:48.206 --> 47:49.275
Really?

47:49.344 --> 47:50.172
So what's with the
flashing lights?

47:50.241 --> 47:51.379
You guys.

47:51.448 --> 47:52.379
Aaron, this--
this isn't right.

47:52.448 --> 47:53.620
That's--
Guys, shut up.

47:53.689 --> 47:55.482
I think there's a
boat coming this way.

48:00.103 --> 48:01.896
We got to put that
bag back right now.

48:01.965 --> 48:03.448
Chelle, by the
time we swim across

48:03.517 --> 48:05.068
that boat will be on us.

48:05.137 --> 48:06.517
We should just leave.

48:06.586 --> 48:07.551
I mean, they probably
can't even see us.

48:07.620 --> 48:08.517
We've got to leave now.

48:08.586 --> 48:10.241
No, this is crazy.

48:10.310 --> 48:11.413
We don't know
who's on that boat.

48:11.482 --> 48:12.931
So what?

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
You just want to hang
around and find out?

48:21.137 --> 48:25.655
Aaron, make a call.

48:25.724 --> 48:27.896
All right. Turn all
the fucking lights off.

48:27.965 --> 48:29.068
Let's get out of here.

48:29.137 --> 48:30.241
Aaron.

48:30.310 --> 48:32.344
Turn the fucking lights out.

48:32.413 --> 48:35.068
Figure it out later.

48:48.551 --> 48:50.068
Well, we needed money.

48:50.137 --> 48:53.827
Maybe everything's
going to be all right.

48:53.896 --> 48:56.758
It will be.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.068
All right.

49:03.137 --> 49:04.896
We're going to have
to wind this up.

49:04.965 --> 49:06.862
Before we do, there's
something I'd like you to hear.

49:08.965 --> 49:09.931
Hello?

49:10.000 --> 49:11.206
Can you hear me?

49:11.275 --> 49:13.448
"The Blue." "The Blue."
We need you!

49:13.517 --> 49:15.000
Help!

49:15.068 --> 49:16.896
"MOL Triumph" to "The Blue,"
reading you.

49:16.965 --> 49:18.448
We're in trouble.
Help me.

49:18.517 --> 49:19.482
Can you hear me?

49:19.551 --> 49:20.827
Fuck, can you hear me?

49:20.896 --> 49:22.517
Blue, we are
attempting to respond

49:22.586 --> 49:23.896
to your distress signal.

49:23.965 --> 49:25.620
Are you able to
give your position?

49:25.689 --> 49:27.344
I-- I don't know.

49:27.413 --> 49:28.793
I don't know where.

49:28.862 --> 49:30.034
Oh God.

49:30.103 --> 49:32.103
I-- I-- I don't
know where we are.

49:32.172 --> 49:33.551
Think.
Oh God.

49:33.620 --> 49:36.517
He's dead.
He's dead!

49:36.586 --> 49:39.793
It's just static after that.

49:39.862 --> 49:44.241
That's the recording of the
distress signal I mentioned.

49:44.310 --> 49:47.655
You recognize the voice?

49:48.586 --> 49:50.068
This crew list--

49:50.137 --> 49:54.379
the only woman on it is
Michelle Wilson, American.

49:54.448 --> 49:57.620
It's not Chelle.

49:59.896 --> 50:02.068
Any idea who
it might be then?

50:05.241 --> 50:08.896
No.

50:08.965 --> 50:11.862
I've never heard
that voice before.

50:17.137 --> 50:18.103
All right.

50:18.172 --> 50:22.413
Well, thanks, Emma.

50:22.482 --> 50:24.827
You've been a big help.

50:36.275 --> 50:39.137
Thanks for your time, Emma.

51:04.517 --> 51:05.965
You have rung Kitty.

51:06.034 --> 51:08.862
Did you really
expect me to pick up?

51:08.931 --> 51:12.137
Leave me a message,
and I will call you back.

51:12.206 --> 51:16.034
Kit, I know you
probably won't get this,

51:16.103 --> 51:20.551
but I'm scared.

51:20.620 --> 51:21.620
I'm sorry.

51:21.689 --> 51:22.965
I'm sorry for what I did.

51:23.034 --> 51:25.931
I'm really sorry.

51:43.310 --> 51:47.655
SAR to command,
we spotted something.

51:48.551 --> 51:51.586
We have a body.
