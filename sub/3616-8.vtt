WEBVTT

00:04.499 --> 00:07.276
HEY. WHERE IS EVERYONE?

00:07.376 --> 00:10.613
SURPRISE.

00:10.713 --> 00:12.156
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

00:12.256 --> 00:13.908
THANK YOU.

00:14.008 --> 00:15.282
I SENT EVERYONE AWAY

00:15.382 --> 00:17.203
SO WE COULD CELEBRATE.

00:17.303 --> 00:18.703
WHAT ARE WE CELEBRATING?

00:18.803 --> 00:21.122
COLE. YOU'RE FINALLY
FULLY HUMAN.

00:21.222 --> 00:24.291
NO MORE DEMON HALF

00:24.391 --> 00:26.292
MEANS NO MORE OBSTACLES
FOR OUR RELATIONSHIP.

00:26.392 --> 00:28.587
YAY, US.

00:28.687 --> 00:30.396
MM.

00:31.689 --> 00:33.050
UM, THAT WAS A TOAST,

00:33.150 --> 00:34.801
AND USUALLY
AFTER THE CLINKING PART,

00:34.901 --> 00:36.803
YOU TAKE A LITTLE SIP.

00:36.903 --> 00:38.402
I DON'T KNOW IF SENDING
YOUR SISTERS AWAY
WAS A GOOD IDEA.

00:40.530 --> 00:43.391
I DON'T HAVE POWERS
ANYMORE,

00:43.491 --> 00:45.018
AND I CAN'T PROTECT YOU
IF THERE'S AN ATTACK.

00:45.118 --> 00:47.245
WELL, MY SISTERS
ARE IN CALLING RANGE

00:47.746 --> 00:51.274
AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY,

00:51.374 --> 00:53.000
I AM IN KISSING RANGE.

00:54.416 --> 00:55.794
PHOEBE, YOU DON'T SEEM
TO UNDERSTAND

00:58.339 --> 00:59.906
THAT WITH
THE SOURCE INJURED,

01:00.006 --> 01:01.322
YOU MIGHT BE
IN MORE DANGER
THAN EVER BEFORE.

01:01.423 --> 01:03.785
WELL, YOU DON'T SEEM
TO UNDERSTAND

01:03.885 --> 01:05.286
THAT SOMETIMES
A GIRL NEEDS A NIGHT OFF.

01:05.385 --> 01:08.138
NOW PLEASE, IS THERE
ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO

01:10.349 --> 01:13.543
TO HELP YOU RELAX?

01:13.643 --> 01:16.336
WELL,

01:16.436 --> 01:17.421
THAT HELPS A LITTLE.

01:17.521 --> 01:19.522
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST
KEEP DOING THAT.

01:20.439 --> 01:22.441
IT'S JUST THAT
WITHOUT A STRONG LEADER,

01:24.362 --> 01:26.344
THERE'S ANARCHY
IN THE UNDERWORLD.

01:26.444 --> 01:28.265
WOW, YOU'RE A SWEET TALKER.

01:28.365 --> 01:30.308
DEMONS WHO WOULD
NORMALLY COMPETE
FOR THE SOURCE'S FAVOR--

01:30.408 --> 01:32.601
WILL START BANNING TOGETHER
TO TRY TO TAKE OUT
THE SOURCE.

01:32.701 --> 01:35.896
HONEY, YOU TOLD ME
THIS PART ALREADY.

01:35.996 --> 01:37.730
BUT I'M NOT SURE
YOU GET IT.

01:37.830 --> 01:39.356
DEMONS HOPING
TO REPLACE THE SOURCE

01:39.456 --> 01:41.317
WILL GATHER
FACTIONS OF FOLLOWERS,

01:41.418 --> 01:43.111
AND WHAT BETTER WAY
TO GAIN SUPPORT
FOR YOUR FACTION

01:43.211 --> 01:46.281
THAN TO KILL
THE INFAMOUS
CHARMED ONES?

01:46.381 --> 01:48.364
[DING]

01:48.464 --> 01:50.217
I'LL GET THAT.

01:53.095 --> 01:56.471
AH! OW! DAMN IT!

01:57.181 --> 01:59.392
IS IT BAD? I COULD
CALL FOR LEO.

02:00.851 --> 02:03.003
NO, NO, NO. IT'S FINE.

02:03.104 --> 02:06.379
I USED TO BE ABLE
TO HOLD FIRE IN THE
PALM OF MY HANDS.

02:06.479 --> 02:09.466
WE VANQUISHED
HALF OF YOU.

02:09.566 --> 02:11.094
THAT'S
A HUGE ADJUSTMENT,

02:11.194 --> 02:12.636
BUT I PROMISE

02:12.736 --> 02:14.138
YOU'LL
FIGURE IT OUT.

02:14.238 --> 02:15.597
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT
TOGETHER.

02:15.698 --> 02:18.600
I'M SERIOUS
ABOUT THE FACTIONS, PHOEBE.

02:18.700 --> 02:22.393
IF DEMONS JOIN FORCES...

02:22.493 --> 02:25.064
I PROMISE YOU

02:25.164 --> 02:26.397
I WILL WORRY
ABOUT THE FACTIONS

02:26.497 --> 02:28.066
FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

02:28.166 --> 02:29.943
BUT FOR NOW...

02:30.043 --> 02:32.462
I WANT US
TO JOIN FORCES.

02:36.506 --> 02:39.785
WE MUST JOIN FORCES

02:39.885 --> 02:41.078
WITH THOSE
WE'VE CONSIDERED OUR ENEMIES

02:41.178 --> 02:43.412
IF WE ARE TO DEFEAT--

02:43.512 --> 02:46.182
WE MUST JOIN FORCES.

02:46.558 --> 02:50.020
[SIGHS] DAMN.

03:02.989 --> 03:06.892
JOINING FORCES
WITH OUR FRIENDS
IS SIMPLE.

03:06.992 --> 03:09.435
ONLY BY WORKING
WITH THOSE

03:09.535 --> 03:11.436
WE HAVE CONSIDERED
OUR ENEMIES

03:11.536 --> 03:12.898
WILL WE ACHIEVE
OUR GREATER GOALS.

03:12.998 --> 03:15.775
IN THE COMING DAYS,

03:15.875 --> 03:17.442
WE MUST RISE ABOVE
OUR DIFFERENCES

03:17.542 --> 03:19.862
IF WE'RE TO REACH
THE LEVEL OF OUR
CONVICTIONS.

03:19.962 --> 03:22.298
[CLAPPING]

03:23.006 --> 03:25.468
HA HA HA.

03:26.384 --> 03:27.534
I THINK I CAN USE THAT.

03:27.635 --> 03:29.452
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

03:29.552 --> 03:32.623
WELL,
AS YOU KNOW CONGRESSMAN,
GATHERING A FOLLOWING

03:32.723 --> 03:34.558
REQUIRES INSPIRATION.
I WANT YOUR MUSE.

03:35.809 --> 03:38.395
YOU CAN SEE ME?

03:39.313 --> 03:41.440
MY WHAT?

03:42.564 --> 03:43.941
THE RING OF INSPIRATION.

03:46.027 --> 03:47.428
BUT HOW DID YOU GET IT?

03:47.528 --> 03:49.570
OH, I THINK A MORE IMPORTANT
QUESTION IS, HOW WILL YOU
GET OUT OF IT?

03:54.117 --> 03:57.787
WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING TO?

04:01.664 --> 04:05.026
PLEASE...

04:05.126 --> 04:06.736
COME NOW, I'M DOING YOU
A FAVOR. REALLY.

04:06.836 --> 04:10.256
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE
THAN AN UNINSPIRED POLITICIAN.

04:10.714 --> 04:13.967
AAH!

04:25.601 --> 04:29.006
âª I AM THE SON âª

04:29.106 --> 04:31.607
âª AND THE HEIR âª

04:32.607 --> 04:34.985
âª I AM HUMAN,
AND I NEED TO BE LOVED âª

04:38.613 --> 04:42.451
âª JUST LIKE
EVERYBODY ELSE DOES âª

04:47.330 --> 04:50.958
âª SEE, I'VE ALREADY
WAITED TOO LONG âª

04:52.918 --> 04:56.628
âª AND ALL MY HOPE IS GONE âª

05:40.294 --> 05:44.213
UH, OK, BEV, IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU REALLY WANT.

05:46.132 --> 05:50.051
UH-HUH. BEV, TAKE YES
FOR AN ANSWER.

05:51.386 --> 05:54.663
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

05:54.763 --> 05:56.099
UH, THAT WAS THE LAST
OF THE COFFEE.

05:57.766 --> 06:00.419
I'VE HAD COFFEE.
THIS IS NOT COFFEE.

06:00.519 --> 06:03.255
HAVE YOU SEEN COLE?

06:03.355 --> 06:05.232
HE WENT OUT.
HE SAID HE HAD
SOME ERRANDS TO RUN.

06:05.689 --> 06:08.968
WHAT KIND OF ERRANDS?

06:09.068 --> 06:10.594
HE DIDN'T SAY.

06:10.694 --> 06:13.097
HOW WAS THE BIG DATE?

06:13.197 --> 06:14.597
GREAT. FINE.

06:14.697 --> 06:17.699
IT WAS OK. HE KEPT TALKING
ABOUT DEMONIC FACTIONS
THE WHOLE TIME.

06:19.286 --> 06:23.524
WELL, THAT'S PROBABLY
BECAUSE IT'S EASIER FOR HIM
TO TALK ABOUT DEMONS

06:23.624 --> 06:26.733
THAN WHAT'S REALLY
ON HIS MIND.

06:26.833 --> 06:28.277
WHICH IS?

06:28.377 --> 06:30.278
WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE
GOING TO RECONSIDER
HIS MARRIAGE PROPOSAL,

06:30.379 --> 06:33.613
NOW THAT
HE'S JUST A HUMAN.

06:33.713 --> 06:35.295
WE TALKED ABOUT THAT
AND HE'S TOTALLY FINE
WITH IT. HE GETS IT.

06:35.305 --> 06:37.617
MM-HMM.

06:37.717 --> 06:40.246
WHY, DID HE SAY SOMETHING
TO YOU?

06:40.346 --> 06:42.831
NO. BUT, UH,
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO.

06:42.932 --> 06:45.959
IT'S WRITTEN ALL OVER
HIS FACE.

06:46.059 --> 06:47.561
AND TRUTH BE TOLD,
IT'S RARE FOR A RELATIONSHIP

06:49.145 --> 06:52.673
TO SURVIVE
A REJECTED PROPOSAL.

06:52.773 --> 06:55.801
BUT IT WASN'T REJECTED.
IT WAS JUST POSTPONED.

06:55.901 --> 06:58.654
PIPER, I'M NOT READY.
YOU KNOW THAT.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.682
MM-HMM, I DO.
BUT IT'S NOT MY HEART
THAT'S INVOLVED.

07:02.782 --> 07:05.641
OR MY EGO,
FOR THAT MATTER.

07:05.741 --> 07:07.453
YOU SHOULD
TALK TO HIM...AGAIN.

07:08.246 --> 07:10.456
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

07:11.747 --> 07:12.648
UH, P3.

07:12.748 --> 07:14.775
AT 9:00 IN THE MORNING?
DON'T CLUB KIDS SLEEP IN?

07:14.875 --> 07:18.530
CORPORATE PARTY. BIG MONEY.
TOTAL NIGHTMARE.

07:18.630 --> 07:21.907
UH--UM...

07:22.007 --> 07:24.784
WHAT IF THERE'S AN ATTACK?

07:24.884 --> 07:26.161
AT 9:00 A.M.?
DON'T DEMONS SLEEP IN?

07:26.261 --> 07:28.662
PIPER, COLE THINKS
THAT THE DEMONS ARE GONNA
START BANDING TOGETHER

07:28.762 --> 07:31.832
TO TAKE OUT THE SOURCE.

07:31.932 --> 07:33.501
GREAT. WELL, I SAY
THE ONLY GOOD SOURCE
IS A DEAD SOURCE.

07:33.601 --> 07:36.670
RIGHT, BUT HE ALSO
SEEMS TO THINK

07:36.770 --> 07:38.964
THAT THE BEST WAY
FOR A FACTION LEADER

07:39.064 --> 07:40.672
TO GAIN THE SUPPORT
OF THE DEMONIC MASSES
WOULD BE TO KILL US.

07:40.772 --> 07:43.635
WHO'S GOING TO KILL US?

07:43.735 --> 07:44.969
NO ONE.

07:45.069 --> 07:45.970
THAT'S NEW.

07:46.070 --> 07:47.804
SO, I WAS THINKING,
SINCE YOU'RE
THE POTIONS MASTER,

07:47.904 --> 07:51.766
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING
YOU COULD WHIP UP?

07:51.866 --> 07:53.683
SOME KIND OF PROTECTION
POTION, MAYBE?

07:53.784 --> 07:55.978
PHOEBES, IF THERE WAS
SUCH A THING AS
A PROTECTION POTION,

07:56.079 --> 07:58.898
WE'D BE MIXING IT
IN OUR MORNING COFFEE.

07:58.998 --> 08:00.941
I KNOW, BUT THERE'S
GOTTA BE SOMETHING
THAT WE CAN DO.

08:01.041 --> 08:03.692
AND BY "WE" I MEAN YOU.

08:03.792 --> 08:05.695
WELL, I SAY WE JUST WAIT
UNTIL WE'RE ATTACKED,
LIKE WE USUALLY DO,

08:05.795 --> 08:09.532
AND THEN DEAL WITH IT THEN.

08:09.632 --> 08:11.242
WHO'S ATTACKING US?
NO ONE.

08:11.342 --> 08:13.118
RIGHT ON.
I GET THE WEEKEND OFF.

08:13.219 --> 08:15.703
SEE, NOW THAT IS THE SPIRIT.

08:15.803 --> 08:18.165
PIPER, IF COLE IS RIGHT,
WE HAVE NO IDEA

08:18.265 --> 08:20.459
HOW MANY OF THEM
WE'RE GOING TO BE
UP AGAINST.

08:20.559 --> 08:22.336
SUDDENLY, I'M BEGINNING
TO MISS THE SOURCE.

08:22.436 --> 08:24.711
AND EVEN IF YOU
DON'T THINK WE NEED
THE PROTECTION,

08:24.811 --> 08:26.712
JUST THINK ABOUT COLE.

08:26.812 --> 08:28.174
HE IS A HUMAN BEING
WITH NO MAGICAL POWERS,

08:28.274 --> 08:30.926
LIVING IN A HOUSE
THAT'S CONSTANTLY
UNDER DEMONIC ATTACK.

08:31.026 --> 08:34.054
WELL, I GUESS
I CAN MAKE SOMETHING.

08:34.154 --> 08:37.390
YAY, YAY, YAY!
I LOVE YOU.

08:37.490 --> 08:42.726
<i>AFTER</i> I GO TO THE CLUB.
WE CANNOT AFFORD
TO LOSE THE INCOME.AND I'VE GOT THIS CLIENT
WHO IS INSISTING
ON A LAST-MINUTE THEME,

08:42.826 --> 08:46.189
AND, MAN, DO I HATE THEMES!

08:46.290 --> 08:48.316
OH, I AM SO GOOD
AT THEMES.

08:48.416 --> 08:50.109
MY PROM THEME,
ALMOST PARADISE,
TOTALLY MY IDEA.

08:50.209 --> 08:53.488
AND THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO IMPRESS ME HOW?

08:53.588 --> 08:55.864
ARE YOU MOVING OUT?

08:55.964 --> 08:57.741
NO, JUST CLEANING OUT.

08:57.841 --> 09:00.077
YOUR ART SUPPLIES?

09:00.177 --> 09:01.620
WELL, BETWEEN WITCH WORK
AND WORK WORK,

09:01.720 --> 09:03.329
I JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY TIME ANYMORE.

09:03.430 --> 09:05.081
THIS IS PERFECT.
WE NEED A THEME.

09:05.181 --> 09:08.292
YOU'RE AN ARTISTIC,
CREATIVE TYPE.

09:08.392 --> 09:09.793
A THEME?

09:09.893 --> 09:10.961
YEAH. I'LL EXPLAIN
ON THE WAY.

09:11.061 --> 09:11.962
US THEME, YOU POTION.

09:12.062 --> 09:14.754
ME PEEVED. YOU ANNOYING.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.484
SEE HOW WELL
THIS WORKED OUT?

09:29.911 --> 09:33.771
BACK OFF.
WE'RE ON THE SAME SIDE.

09:33.871 --> 09:37.401
OH, WE ALMOST
KILLED A DEMON.

09:37.501 --> 09:39.902
THE SOURCE WOULD
HAVE OUR HEADS.

09:40.003 --> 09:41.904
MAN, I LOVE
THAT GLAMOURING POWER.

09:42.004 --> 09:43.780
YOU KNOW, I FALL FOR IT
EVERY TIME.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.157
IF YOU WARLOCK SCUM
DON'T MIND,
I'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

09:45.257 --> 09:48.327
OH, BUT SO DO WE...

09:48.427 --> 09:49.745
AND WE'RE GONNA
NEED TO BORROW

09:49.845 --> 09:52.205
THAT LITTLE TRICK
OF YOURS.

09:52.305 --> 09:53.889
AAH!

09:54.599 --> 09:55.890
NICELY DONE!

09:57.892 --> 10:00.129
NOW, USE YOUR NEW POWER
TO KILL THE CHARMED ONES
AND BRING ME BACK THEIRS.

10:00.229 --> 10:03.632
HEY, I THOUGHT WE WERE
TAKING OUT THE WITCHES
TOGETHER.

10:03.732 --> 10:06.884
I HAVE A FACTION TO BUILD,
AND TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.

10:06.984 --> 10:09.345
THERE'S RECRUITING TO DO,
POWERS TO GATHER.

10:09.445 --> 10:12.015
SO, I'M SUPPOSED
TO RISK MY LIFE

10:12.115 --> 10:13.766
SO YOU CAN BECOME
THE SOURCE?

10:13.866 --> 10:15.153
AREN'T YOU TIRED OF LIVING
UNDER DEMONIC RULE...

10:15.163 --> 10:17.853
OF BEING A SECOND-CLASS
CITIZEN? MY FRIEND,

10:17.953 --> 10:20.789
IN THE COMING DAYS,
WE MUST RISE ABOVE
OUR DIFFERENCES

10:20.996 --> 10:24.900
IF WE ARE TO REACH
THE LEVEL OF OUR CONVICTIONS.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.070
AND WHAT DO I
GET OUT OF IT?

10:28.170 --> 10:31.922
A LITTLE INSPIRATION.

10:44.059 --> 10:47.962
BEV, I'M TELLING YOU,
FORTIES NIGHT IS PERFECT.

10:48.062 --> 10:51.674
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.
THE ZOOT SUITS,
THE SADDLE SHOES,

10:51.774 --> 10:54.385
THE PATRIOTISM.
WHAT MORE COULD YOU
ASK FOR?

10:54.485 --> 10:56.844
OH, I JUST DON'T KNOW.

10:56.944 --> 10:59.431
I MEAN, WEREN'T THE FIFTIES
A LITTLE BIT MORE FLASHY?

10:59.531 --> 11:02.200
YEAH, IF YOU WANT
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN
DONE A MILLION TIMES.

11:02.492 --> 11:05.852
EXCUSE ME?

11:05.952 --> 11:06.853
UM...HONESTLY, BEV,

11:06.953 --> 11:09.815
I THINK THE FORTIES
IS YOUR ERA.

11:09.915 --> 11:12.192
I MEAN, YOU ALREADY HAVE
THIS KINDA VERONICA LAKE
THING GOING ON.

11:12.292 --> 11:15.860
[CHUCKLES]
I DO?

11:15.961 --> 11:17.862
OH, YEAH. PEEK-A-BOO
HAIRDO, SOME NICE
PEARL EARRINGS,

11:17.962 --> 11:20.865
YOU'RE A DEAD RINGER.

11:20.965 --> 11:22.718
OH...UM...WELL...THEN...

11:24.968 --> 11:28.872
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
HAS SOME SHOPPING TO DO.

11:28.972 --> 11:30.874
YEP! HERE IS THE NUMBER
FOR THE COSTUME PLACE,

11:30.974 --> 11:33.977
AND TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS
TO DRESS THERE OR BE SQUARE.

11:34.977 --> 11:38.215
THANKS, GIRLS.

11:38.315 --> 11:39.216
WHEW. OH...

11:39.316 --> 11:41.983
IF IT ISN'T
MR. SNEAK-OUT-OF-BED.

11:42.360 --> 11:45.887
YEAH, I HAD SOME STUFF
TO DO.

11:45.987 --> 11:47.098
YEAH? WHAT KINDA STUFF?

11:47.198 --> 11:49.266
WELL...

11:49.366 --> 11:50.393
WHAT--WHAT'S THAT?

11:50.493 --> 11:52.603
OH.

11:52.703 --> 11:54.412
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT?

11:56.331 --> 11:57.273
GET THAT THING
OUT OF HERE.

11:57.373 --> 11:58.898
OH, COME ON. YOU GUYS SEE
WORSE THAN THIS EVERY DAY.

11:58.998 --> 12:01.318
NO, WE SEE DEMONS EVERY DAY.
THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE.

12:01.418 --> 12:04.321
THERE IS HOW?

12:04.421 --> 12:05.572
UH, WELL, FOR ONE THING,
WE'RE NOT LIKELY

12:05.672 --> 12:06.948
TO ACCIDENTALLY
VANQUISH OURSELVES.

12:07.048 --> 12:08.784
WHERE DID YOU GET IT?

12:08.884 --> 12:09.908
WELL, I MAY NOT
BE A DEMON ANYMORE,

12:10.008 --> 12:12.787
BUT I STILL KNOW WHERE
TO FIND THE BAD GUYS.

12:12.887 --> 12:14.912
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
GO FIND THE BAD GUYS

12:15.012 --> 12:17.457
AND GIVE IT BACK
TO THEM?

12:17.557 --> 12:19.137
LOOK, I HAVE TO HAVE
A WAY TO PROTECT MYSELF
AND THE ONE I LOVE.

12:19.147 --> 12:21.586
OK, COLE, I AM NOT
LIVING IN A HOUSE
WITH A GUN.

12:21.686 --> 12:24.021
IT MAKES THINGS
MORE DANGEROUS,
NOT LESS.

12:25.649 --> 12:26.398
HEY.
HEY.

12:29.025 --> 12:29.925
UH, PIPER'S AT HOME.

12:30.025 --> 12:31.512
I KNOW. I JUST TALKED TO HER.
I CAME HERE TO FIND YOU GUYS.

12:31.612 --> 12:33.179
WAS THERE AN ATTACK?
UH, IN A WAY. UH,

12:33.279 --> 12:35.807
MUSES HAVE BEEN DISAPPEARING.
THE ELDERS ARE VERY CONCERNED.

12:35.908 --> 12:38.184
MUSES? THE ONES WHO
INSPIRE CREATIVITY?
THEY'RE REAL?

12:38.284 --> 12:41.855
YES, AND THEY ARE
IN A VERY REAL DANGER.

12:41.955 --> 12:44.022
IT'D BE A POWERFUL EVIL
TO FIND A WAY
TO HURT A MUSE.

12:44.122 --> 12:46.567
FACTIONS.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.209
Phoebe:
WE BETTER GET BACK.

12:49.252 --> 12:50.779
WHAT ABOUT
FORTIES NIGHT?

12:50.879 --> 12:52.572
WE'LL CALL THE DECORATOR
FROM THE CAR.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.030
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL MEET YOU GUYS AT HOME.

12:54.131 --> 12:56.116
I'M GONNA SEE WHAT ELSE
I CAN FIND OUT.

12:56.216 --> 12:58.870
UH, LEO,
BEFORE YOU GO...

12:58.970 --> 13:00.952
WAIT. UM...

13:01.053 --> 13:03.415
COME ON.

13:03.515 --> 13:04.808
CAN YOU ORB THIS
TO MARS, PLEASE?

13:08.394 --> 13:11.939
I WON'T EVEN ASK.

13:27.327 --> 13:30.979
HEY, HOW'S
THE PROTECTION POTION?

13:31.079 --> 13:33.065
NONEXISTENT.

13:33.165 --> 13:34.982
HEY, WE KEPT UP
OUR END OF THE DEAL.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.527
I KNOW. BEV CALLED,
AND SHE'S THRILLED,
AND I THANK YOU,

13:36.627 --> 13:39.029
BUT I THOUGHT WE SHOULD
MOVE ON TO THE MUSES.

13:39.129 --> 13:41.948
MUSES.

13:42.048 --> 13:42.989
WHICH ARE "BEINGS
OF PURE LIGHT

13:43.089 --> 13:45.159
WHOSE SOLE PURPOSE
IS TO INSPIRE
PEOPLE'S PASSION

13:45.259 --> 13:47.620
AND CREATIVITY.

13:47.720 --> 13:48.995
LIKE ANGELS,
THEY GUIDE US

13:49.095 --> 13:50.206
WITH AN UNSEEN HAND
OF INSPIRATION."

13:50.306 --> 13:53.124
WAIT, HOW CAN EVIL
HURT SOMEONE
WHO'S INVISIBLE?

13:53.224 --> 13:56.294
I HAVE NO IDEA.

13:56.394 --> 13:57.629
A GOOD PLACE TO START
WOULD BE TO ASK A MUSE,

13:57.729 --> 14:00.004
BUT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
HOW TO SUMMON ONE.

14:00.104 --> 14:01.883
DO YOU GUYS FEEL THAT?

14:01.983 --> 14:04.343
WHAT?

14:04.443 --> 14:05.944
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S LIKE A, UM...

14:06.110 --> 14:08.530
WOW. IT'S LIKE A--
LIKE A FEELING.

14:11.074 --> 14:14.477
HONEY, WHATCHA LOOKIN' FOR?

14:14.577 --> 14:16.454
I THINK THERE'S A MUSE
SOMEWHERE IN THIS ROOM.

14:20.624 --> 14:24.544
BEING OF CREATIVITY,
SHOW YOURSELF NOW TO ME.

14:24.919 --> 14:28.614
YOUR LIGHT WHICH SHINES
UPON OUR FACE

14:28.714 --> 14:31.174
LET OUR VISION NOW EMBRACE.

14:33.844 --> 14:37.830
I WAS HOPING I COULD
INSPIRE YOU TO DO THAT.
I'M MELODY.

14:37.930 --> 14:41.040
WOW. I'M--I'M PHOEBE.

14:41.140 --> 14:44.043
AND--AND THIS IS, UM--

14:44.143 --> 14:45.044
I KNOW WHO
YOU GIRLS ARE.

14:45.144 --> 14:46.224
I'VE BEEN INSPIRING YOU
YOUR WHOLE LIVES.

14:46.234 --> 14:48.840
NOW I WAS HOPING
YOU CAN HELP ME.

14:48.940 --> 14:50.884
SO, YOU KNOW
WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING
TO THE MUSES.

14:50.984 --> 14:54.178
YES, WE WERE INSPIRING
A SYMPHONY,

14:54.278 --> 14:55.638
AND A FRIEND OF MINE,
A FELLOW MUSE, WAS CAPTURED.

14:55.738 --> 14:59.056
I WAS LUCKY TO GET AWAY.

14:59.156 --> 15:00.433
GET AWAY FROM WHAT?

15:00.533 --> 15:02.060
A WARLOCK CARRYING
THE RING OF INSPIRATION.

15:02.160 --> 15:05.021
Phoebe: THE WHAT?

15:05.121 --> 15:06.146
IT'S A RING THAT
ENABLES THE WEARER

15:06.246 --> 15:07.606
TO SEE AND CAPTURE MUSES.

15:07.706 --> 15:10.693
I MEAN, IT WAS CREATED
BY GOOD MAGIC

15:10.793 --> 15:12.235
TO CHANNEL INSPIRATION
IN TIMES OF GREAT NEED.

15:12.336 --> 15:14.989
A WARLOCK.
IS THAT LIKE A DEMON?

15:15.089 --> 15:17.156
PRETTY MUCH, YEAH.

15:17.256 --> 15:18.741
THAT'S NICE.
MM.

15:18.841 --> 15:20.009
HI. I THOUGHT
YOU WERE ORBING.

15:20.885 --> 15:24.078
WHAT?

15:24.178 --> 15:25.080
MELODY, LEO.
WHITELIGHTER, MUSE.

15:25.180 --> 15:27.416
NICE TO MEET YOU.
WE GO WAY BACK.

15:27.516 --> 15:29.182
OH, RIGHT.
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

15:30.143 --> 15:32.770
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF THE RING OF INSPIRATION?

15:34.064 --> 15:36.048
UH, I THINK SO.
RED JEWEL?

15:36.148 --> 15:38.693
ISN'T THAT SOMETHING
YOU WOULD HAVE NORMALLY
MENTIONED EARLIER?

15:39.275 --> 15:42.154
RIGHT. UM, YEAH.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

15:46.197 --> 15:46.365
LEO?

15:49.326 --> 15:50.561
WHAT?

15:50.661 --> 15:51.829
[GASP]

15:54.039 --> 15:54.665
OH. OH. UHH.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.377
PAIGE, BEHIND YOU!
AAH!

16:09.301 --> 16:12.663
Piper: YOU OK?

16:12.763 --> 16:15.057
UNH. WHAT WAS THAT?

16:16.016 --> 16:18.961
THAT WAS A WARLOCK.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.337
WAS THAT THE WARLOCK
THAT CAPTURED
YOUR FRIEND?

16:20.437 --> 16:23.465
NO.

16:23.565 --> 16:24.841
OH, THEY MUST
BE WORKING TOGETHER.

16:24.941 --> 16:27.844
AND THAT, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN,

16:27.944 --> 16:29.611
IS WHAT YOU CALL
A FACTION.

16:32.781 --> 16:36.768
PIPER, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
WE HAVE TO MAKE A PLAN.

16:36.869 --> 16:38.144
I HAVE A PLAN.
WHICH IS?

16:38.244 --> 16:40.355
TO COOK. NOW THAT
I KNOW WHAT WE'RE
UP AGAINST,

16:40.455 --> 16:42.397
I CAN PRACTICALLY
TASTE THE POTION.

16:42.497 --> 16:44.148
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT DOES, BUT IT TASTES
PRETTY GOOD.

16:44.248 --> 16:46.276
I CAN'T BELIEVE I ALMOST
THREW AWAY MY PAINTS.

16:46.376 --> 16:48.487
I'M GONNA WRITE
A VANQUISHING SPELL.

16:48.587 --> 16:50.404
ACTUALLY, I--I--
I HAVE TO WRITE
A VANQUISHING SPELL.

16:50.504 --> 16:53.741
I--I KEEP HEARING
RHYMING IN MY HEAD,
AND--

16:53.841 --> 16:56.201
ARE--ARE YOU DOING THAT?

16:56.302 --> 16:57.745
OH, NO, YOU'RE
DOING THAT.

16:57.845 --> 16:58.996
I'M JUST HELPING IT
COME OUT.

16:59.096 --> 17:00.747
OH, YES, YOU DO.
WITHOUT A DOUBT.

17:00.848 --> 17:03.708
I THINK I SHOULD
PROBABLY LEAVE.

17:03.808 --> 17:06.210
I'M NOT MEANT
TO STAY IN ONE PLACE
FOR TOO LONG.

17:06.310 --> 17:08.169
INSPIRATION GETS
A LITTLE INTENSE.

17:08.269 --> 17:11.172
OK, BUT THAT'S GOOD.

17:11.271 --> 17:12.728
IF THE WARLOCKS ARE
ENSLAVING OTHER MUSES
TO INSPIRE THEM,

17:12.738 --> 17:15.175
THEN WE NEED
ALL THE HELP
WE CAN GET.

17:15.275 --> 17:16.469
I THINK I KNOW
HOW TO GET THE RING.
YOU DO?

17:16.569 --> 17:19.179
CAN YOU DESCRIBE
THE WARLOCK TO ME?

17:19.279 --> 17:21.641
I THINK SO.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.433
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

17:23.532 --> 17:24.643
AH, I'M GOING TO DRAW HIM.

17:24.742 --> 17:27.020
I THINK LEO SHOULD
ORB ME UNDERGROUND.

17:27.121 --> 17:29.187
WHAT?!

17:29.287 --> 17:30.451
I COULD FIND OUT
WHO THE FACTION LEADER IS.

17:30.461 --> 17:32.943
I MAY NOT HAVE MY POWERS
ANYMORE, BUT I STILL KNOW
THE TERRAIN.

17:33.043 --> 17:36.070
YEAH, AND YOU MAY
JUST FIND YOURSELF
IN EVERLASTING PAIN.

17:36.170 --> 17:38.547
THAT'S A RHYME.
YEAH.

17:39.547 --> 17:41.033
I'M SORRY.
NOW'S NOT THE TIME. OH!

17:41.133 --> 17:43.952
COLE, IF YOU
GO UNDERGROUND,

17:44.052 --> 17:46.121
YOU WILL BE
A SITTING DUCK
WITHOUT YOUR POWERS.

17:46.221 --> 17:47.914
I'M A SITTING DUCK
UP HERE AS WELL.

17:48.014 --> 17:50.749
AT LEAST THIS WAY
I CAN BE USEFUL.

17:50.849 --> 17:53.460
COLE, YOU ARE USEFUL...

17:53.560 --> 17:55.754
ALIVE.

17:55.854 --> 17:57.355
IT'S JUST NOW YOU
HAVE TO BE THE BRAINS
BEHIND THE OPERATION,

17:57.772 --> 18:01.134
NOT THE BRAWN.

18:01.234 --> 18:02.605
WELL, IS THERE
SOME RULE THAT SAYS
I HAVE TO CHOOSE?

18:02.615 --> 18:05.220
WELL, I CAN MAKE ONE UP,
BUT IT WOULD JUST BE A RUSE.

18:05.320 --> 18:08.306
BUT MAYBE I SHOULD
POINT OUT THAT--

18:08.406 --> 18:10.892
I THINK COLE HAS A POINT.

18:10.992 --> 18:12.811
EXCUSE ME?

18:12.911 --> 18:14.227
WELL, HE IS A DEMON, RIGHT?

18:14.327 --> 18:15.229
<i>WAS</i> A DEMON.

18:15.329 --> 18:16.230
BEFORE YOU GET
ANY MORE--

18:16.330 --> 18:18.065
NO, HE WAS A HALF-DEMON
THAT'S PROBABLY LIVED
FOR ABOUT A CENTURY,

18:18.165 --> 18:21.609
SO THAT MEANS
HE KNOWS HIS WAY AROUND
DOWN THERE PRETTY WELL,

18:21.709 --> 18:24.904
AND WE CAN USE
ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET.

18:25.004 --> 18:26.447
LEO--

18:26.548 --> 18:27.614
I THINK WHAT MELODY
IS TRYING TO SAY--

18:27.715 --> 18:29.324
NO, THE POINT IS,
BOUNTY HUNTERS HAVEN'T
BEEN ATTACKING

18:29.424 --> 18:31.493
BECAUSE THEY THINK
HE'S DEAD.

18:31.593 --> 18:33.162
IF HE GOES DOWN
TO THE UNDERWORLD--

18:33.262 --> 18:34.747
I'M STILL HERE!

18:34.847 --> 18:36.246
COLE,
IF YOU GO UNDERGROUND
AND ANYONE SEES YOU,

18:36.346 --> 18:38.499
YOU WILL BE BACK
ON THE DEMONIC RADAR,

18:38.599 --> 18:40.793
ONLY THIS TIME YOU
WILL NOT HAVE ANYTHING
TO PROTECT YOURSELF.

18:40.893 --> 18:43.796
STARTING TO SEEM LIKE
YOU HAVE SOME KIND
OF DEATH WISH.

18:43.896 --> 18:46.298
IT SEEMS TO ME
YOU WON'T BE HAPPY
UNTIL I DON AN APRON

18:46.398 --> 18:48.592
AND BECOME
YOUR HOUSEBOY.

18:48.692 --> 18:49.968
HEY! ALL RIGHT,
HERE IS THE THING, GUYS.

18:50.068 --> 18:52.470
EVERY TIME
THERE IS A MUSE AROUND,

18:52.570 --> 18:54.555
PASSIONS TEND TO RUN
A LITTLE HIGHER.

18:54.655 --> 18:56.264
A LOT HIGHER.

18:56.364 --> 18:57.264
SO LET'S KEEP THAT IN MIND

18:57.365 --> 18:58.726
IN OUR COMMUNICATIONS
WITH EACH OTHER, OK?

18:58.826 --> 19:00.602
PHOEBE, GO WRITE
YOUR SPELL.

19:00.702 --> 19:03.270
PAIGE, DO WHATEVER IT IS
YOU WERE GOING TO DO.

19:03.370 --> 19:06.483
COLE, PLEASE JOIN ME
IN THE KITCHEN

19:06.583 --> 19:08.317
AND TELL ME EVERYTHING
YOU KNOW ABOUT WARLOCKS

19:08.417 --> 19:10.376
SO THAT I CAN
MAKE MY POTION.

19:12.297 --> 19:15.741
WE'LL TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER.

19:15.841 --> 19:18.243
ALLIGATOR.

19:18.343 --> 19:19.677
Piper: COLE!

19:30.353 --> 19:34.465
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
IS WHY A WARLOCK WOULD
EVEN WANT THAT RING.

19:34.565 --> 19:38.469
ARE YOU KIDDING?
EVIL NEVER GETS
TO FEEL

19:38.569 --> 19:40.303
THE MUSE'S
INSPIRATION,

19:40.403 --> 19:42.056
AND I CAN TELL YOU
I'VE NEVER FELT ANYTHING
LIKE IT IN MY LIFE.

19:42.156 --> 19:43.765
WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE?

19:43.865 --> 19:45.350
IT'S LIKE A--
A POWER SURGE.

19:45.450 --> 19:47.392
AN OVERDOSE
OF ADRENALINE.

19:47.492 --> 19:48.937
I CAN TELL YOU
THESE WARLOCKS MUST
BE SUCKING IT UP,

19:49.037 --> 19:50.449
SO WHATEVER IT IS
THAT YOU'RE DOING,
PLEASE DO IT FAST,

19:50.459 --> 19:52.313
BECAUSE I PROMISE
THEY'LL BE BACK.

19:52.413 --> 19:54.024
LOOK, I AM MAKING THIS UP
AS I GO ALONG,

19:54.124 --> 19:56.316
SO, POWER SURGE OR NO,
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
BE PATIENT.

19:56.416 --> 19:58.903
JUST LIKE YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO BE PATIENT
WITH PHOEBE

19:59.003 --> 20:00.696
ON THE MARRIAGE FRONT.

20:00.796 --> 20:01.948
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.

20:02.048 --> 20:05.324
YOU DON'T KNOW SISTERS
VERY WELL, DO YOU?

20:05.424 --> 20:07.426
COLE, YOU'RE STRUGGLING,
RIGHT? TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO BE THIS NEW PERSON?

20:07.636 --> 20:11.497
I THOUGHT WE WERE HERE
TO TALK ABOUT WARLOCKS.

20:11.598 --> 20:14.000
NO.

20:14.100 --> 20:15.333
WHAT YOU DON'T GET
IS THAT PHOEBE IS TRYING

20:15.433 --> 20:17.335
TO DO THE EXACT SAME THING.

20:17.435 --> 20:19.046
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN
THE YOUNGEST SISTER,
THE ETERNAL CHILD,

20:19.146 --> 20:22.549
THE CAREFREE, FUN-LOVING--

20:22.649 --> 20:24.341
AND?
AND IN A MINUTE,

20:24.441 --> 20:26.342
SHE LOST PRU,
DISCOVERED PAIGE,

20:26.443 --> 20:27.846
AND BECAME
THE MIDDLE SISTER.

20:27.946 --> 20:29.345
AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF,
YOU PROPOSE.

20:29.445 --> 20:31.807
THE IDEA OF MARRIAGE,
BEING THAT MUCH
OF A GROWNUP,

20:31.907 --> 20:35.143
IS TERRIFYING TO PHOEBE.

20:35.243 --> 20:36.644
DID SHE SAY THAT?

20:36.745 --> 20:38.021
NO, BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO.
I'M HER BIG SISTER.

20:38.121 --> 20:39.789
I'VE KNOWN HER ONLY,
OH, HER WHOLE LIFE.

20:40.374 --> 20:42.457
CAN I HAVE A WORD?

20:46.087 --> 20:49.239
OOH!

20:49.340 --> 20:50.464
SEE WHAT A LITTLE PATIENCE
WILL GET YOU?

20:50.715 --> 20:53.466
I'M ASKING A FAVOR, LEO.
MAN-TO-MAN.

20:54.468 --> 20:58.205
YOU, UH, WANT ME
TO TALK TO PHOEBE?

20:58.305 --> 21:01.041
I WANT YOU TO ORB ME
UNDERGROUND.

21:01.141 --> 21:03.002
COLE, THAT'S
THE INSPIRATION TALKING.

21:03.102 --> 21:05.377
MAYBE SO, BUT THINK
ABOUT IT, LEO.

21:05.477 --> 21:07.088
THEIR BIG PLAN RIGHT NOW
IS TO DRAW THE WARLOCK.

21:07.188 --> 21:09.257
THEY'RE THE CHARMED ONES.
I TRUST THAT THEY KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

21:09.357 --> 21:12.176
JUST LISTEN TO ME.
I CAN'T BE CERTAIN
BUT I THINK

21:12.276 --> 21:13.969
THAT WARLOCK
USED DEMONIC POWERS.

21:14.069 --> 21:15.846
WHICH MEANS HE
KILLED A DEMON
TO GET THEM?

21:15.946 --> 21:18.388
AREN'T THERE LAWS
AGAINST THAT?

21:18.488 --> 21:19.974
IT'S PUNISHABLE
BY DEATH.

21:20.074 --> 21:21.654
NOW, I KNOW WHERE
THE DEMONS WILL CONVENE
TO DISCUSS THIS TREASON.

21:21.664 --> 21:25.271
THEY PROBABLY KNOW
BY NOW WHICH WARLOCK
IS BEHIND IT.

21:25.371 --> 21:27.622
ALL WE HAVE TO DO...
IS LISTEN.

21:28.124 --> 21:31.651
AND NOT BE SEEN.
WE CAN GO NOW,

21:31.751 --> 21:33.401
AND BE BACK BEFORE
ANYBODY NOTICES.

21:33.501 --> 21:35.280
OH, THEY'RE GONNA NOTICE...

21:35.380 --> 21:37.548
AND THEN THEY'RE
GONNA KILL ME.

21:40.259 --> 21:43.661
"A WARLOCK IS A FUNNY THING,

21:43.761 --> 21:45.788

"AND WHEN WE SAY
THESE WORDS TO HIM,

21:50.184 --> 21:52.753
SOUNDS MORE LIKE A LIMERICK
THAN A SPELL.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.963
DAMN.

21:55.063 --> 21:57.606
I THINK HIS NOSE
WAS A LITTLE LONGER
THAN THAT.

21:58.523 --> 22:00.525
YOUR WORK IS WONDERFUL.

22:01.986 --> 22:03.721
THANKS TO YOU.

22:03.821 --> 22:05.222
NO, PAIGE,
I HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH PRODUCT,

22:05.322 --> 22:07.682
ONLY THE INSPIRATION
TO CREATE IT.

22:07.782 --> 22:09.768
I COULD USE
A LITTLE OF THAT
OVER HERE.

22:09.868 --> 22:12.704
OK. CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND CONCENTRATE.

22:18.167 --> 22:21.443
THANK YOU.

22:21.543 --> 22:22.544
SO, HOW COME
YOU STOPPED PAINTING?

22:25.299 --> 22:26.491
HOW COME YOU STOPPED
INSPIRING ME TO PAINT?

22:26.591 --> 22:28.660
I ALSO HAVE NO CONTROL
OVER THE WILL, PAIGE.

22:28.760 --> 22:31.452
YOU STOPPED PAINTING
BECAUSE YOU STOPPED
CARING ABOUT YOUR ART.

22:31.552 --> 22:34.665
NO, I DIDN'T STOP CARING
ABOUT MY ART.

22:34.765 --> 22:36.875
I JUST, I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS I'M A PERFECTIONIST,

22:36.975 --> 22:40.460
AND ONCE I STOPPED HAVING
ENOUGH TIME TO PRACTICE,

22:40.560 --> 22:43.130
WELL, I JUST KINDA
THREW IN THE TOWEL.

22:43.230 --> 22:45.590
ART ISN'T
ABOUT PERFECTION.

22:45.690 --> 22:46.841
IT'S ABOUT EXPRESSION.

22:46.942 --> 22:49.468
THE KEY IS SIMPLY
TO LOVE IT.

22:49.568 --> 22:52.013
THAT'S THE CALL
I ANSWER.

WOW.

23:20.846 --> 23:24.166
IS THAT HIM?

23:24.266 --> 23:25.251
PRECISELY.

23:25.351 --> 23:26.919
NOW THAT I HAVE
SOMETHING TO FOCUS ON,

23:27.019 --> 23:28.545
I THINK I CAN CALL
FOR THE RING.

23:28.645 --> 23:29.921
OH, THAT'S BRILLIANT.
THE RING WILL ORB TO YOU,

23:30.021 --> 23:31.798
AND THEN IF HE WANTS IT BACK,
HE'LL HAVE TO FOLLOW IT.

23:31.898 --> 23:34.217
WHICH IS WHEN WE HIT HIM
WITH THE POTION.

23:34.317 --> 23:36.428
AND MAKE A HUGE COMMOTION.

23:36.528 --> 23:37.761
RIGHT. THE POTION
WILL FLASH IN HIS EYES,

23:37.861 --> 23:41.265
WHICH ARE VERY SENSITIVE.
THIS SHOULD KEEP HIM
FROM BLINKING

23:41.365 --> 23:43.641

IT'S HOW THE WARLOCKS
GET AROUND.

23:47.829 --> 23:49.604
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST, I DON'T KNOW,

23:49.704 --> 23:51.482
FREEZE HIM,
OR BLOW HIM UP
OR SOMETHING?

23:51.582 --> 23:53.192
WELL, SOMETIMES WARLOCKS
DON'T FREEZE OR BLOW UP.

23:53.292 --> 23:56.361

THEY'D DO THIS.

25:29.751 --> 25:31.027

25:31.127 --> 25:33.611
THE ONLY REASON LEO
WOULDN'T HEAR US CALLING

SAY ANYTHING,

LIKE A JOE TO ME.

AS IN SHE LEFT?

SUCKED INTO A BIG,
RED RING

WHAT WAS IT?

28:10.434 --> 28:12.670

RIGHT. DEVLIN.

28:12.770 --> 28:14.853
OK, SO WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU DOING NOW?

IN THE BRILLIANCE
OF OUR FAILURE.

28:21.736 --> 28:23.760

28:23.861 --> 28:25.762
OH, WELL, I CALLED
FOR THE RING,

28:25.862 --> 28:27.848
IT CAME TO ME AND, UH,
WE SET THE MUSES FREE.

28:27.948 --> 28:30.810
WHICH WAS USELESS
BECAUSE DEVLIN CAME
AND TOOK IT RIGHT BACK

28:30.910 --> 28:34.605
SO HE COULD
CAPTURE THEM ALL AGAIN.

28:34.705 --> 28:36.872
AND HE TOOK OUR OWN MUSE,
AND HE'S GONNA USE
HER INSPIRATION TO KILL US.

28:38.083 --> 28:40.502
OH, THE IRONY.

28:41.544 --> 28:43.165
OK, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN
ON AN INSPIRATION BINGE

28:43.175 --> 28:46.073
AND THAT YOU ARE WIPED OUT,

28:46.173 --> 28:47.616
BUT NOW IS NOT THE TIME
TO GIVE UP.

28:47.716 --> 28:49.826
HE'S RIGHT. DEVLIN
WILL BE BACK SOON,

28:49.926 --> 28:52.579

THAN BEFORE.

THAT ANY WOMAN

29:37.635 --> 29:39.172
WHO WAS TRULY IN LOVE
WOULD REALLY TURN DOWN
A MARRIAGE PROPOSAL.

29:39.182 --> 29:40.912

YOU KNOW ABOUT WOMEN.

29:41.012 --> 29:43.831

SO MUCH THAT WE DON'T
KNOW ABOUT EACH OTHER.

29:43.931 --> 29:46.793
I MEAN, WE DON'T KNOW
THE NEW RULES.

WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS
FOR YOU TO BE HUMAN,

29:48.645 --> 29:50.837

IS THE PROBLEM?

AND I KNOW WE'RE TIRED,

WE CAN JUST LAY DOWN
AND PLAY DEAD.

GONNA HAVE TO PLAY.

HAS THAT RING.

ABOUT SAVING OUR OWN LIVES

TO SAVE MELODY,

31:26.271 --> 31:28.382
THEN GET INSPIRED
TO SAVE YOUR OWN LIFE.

31:28.482 --> 31:30.801
FOR LEO.
FOR ME. FOR PAIGE.

31:30.901 --> 31:33.094
I DON'T CARE HOW YOU DO IT,
JUST DO IT

31:33.194 --> 31:35.972
BECAUSE I GUARANTEE YOU,
DEVLIN IS NOT SITTING
ON HIS BUTT

31:36.072 --> 31:38.850
WAITING FOR INSPIRATION
TO STRIKE.

31:38.950 --> 31:40.933
WE HAVE PROVEN WITH THE LOSS
OF OUR FALLEN COMRADES

31:41.033 --> 31:44.020
THAT WE CAN'T TAKE ON
THE WITCHES AS INDIVIDUALS.

31:44.120 --> 31:46.857

IN NUMBERS, MY FRIENDS,

WELL, IF ANYONE
HAS A BETTER IDEA,
WE'RE OPEN TO IT.

WE NEED THE RING BACK NOW.

SHE'S RIGHT.
WITH ALL THE MUSES AFRAID
TO COME OUT OF HIDING,

32:51.094 --> 32:52.414

THE WHOLE BALANCE,

32:52.514 --> 32:53.997
GIVING EVIL THE UPPER HAND.

32:54.097 --> 32:55.918
I GET THAT,

TO THE UNDERWORLD

32:56.018 --> 32:58.001

IF I'D EVER SEE YOU AGAIN,
