00:51.352 --> 00:54.988
* Country fans, country proud

01:07.768 --> 01:09.002
* Raise my glass

01:09.103 --> 01:10.571
* Say a toast

01:10.671 --> 01:13.807
* To the fans I love the most

01:13.907 --> 01:15.376
* Drink it up

01:15.476 --> 01:17.044
* Sing it out

01:17.145 --> 01:21.048
* Let me hear you country land

01:26.154 --> 01:27.488
You got me good.

01:30.391 --> 01:34.728
* Country fans, country proud

01:36.964 --> 01:39.400
Thank you, Atlanta, I love you.

01:48.008 --> 01:49.210
Nice job, mate.

01:49.310 --> 01:50.344
Wait here, wait a minute.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.713
Noah! Noah! Noah!

01:54.548 --> 01:57.851
- Bring it on back, bring it on
back!

01:57.951 --> 02:00.288
Noah! Noah! Noah!

02:17.538 --> 02:19.207
* I'm not the kind of guy to
settle down *

02:19.307 --> 02:20.674
* Stop and put my roots down

02:20.774 --> 02:23.377
* Baby, I'm a runaway

02:23.477 --> 02:24.778
* Got no undercover

02:24.878 --> 02:26.580
* I'm a rolling like a rolling
stone *

02:26.680 --> 02:28.749
* Never felt the people stay

02:28.849 --> 02:33.854
* Then darling, you walked into
the room *

02:33.954 --> 02:38.259
* Stopped me in my tracks

02:38.359 --> 02:41.195
* And just like that

02:41.295 --> 02:43.331
* I was dreaming 'bout us

02:43.431 --> 02:44.365
* Lovely marriage

02:44.465 --> 02:47.468
* Put a little baby in a baby
carriage *

02:47.568 --> 02:50.404
* Putting our name on an old
mailbox *

02:50.504 --> 02:53.507
* Found a big life right
near your parents *

02:53.607 --> 02:54.642
* I know it sounds weird

02:54.742 --> 02:56.277
* Know it sounds strange

02:56.377 --> 02:59.280
* Girl you got me thinking
I'mma buy you a ring *

02:59.380 --> 03:02.283
* No place on Earth I'd rather
be *

03:02.383 --> 03:04.718
* Than with you, baby

03:04.818 --> 03:08.155
* You're my whole world

03:15.763 --> 03:17.565
How y'all doing?

03:17.665 --> 03:19.166
Thanks for coming out tonight.

03:19.267 --> 03:20.067
How was the show?

03:20.167 --> 03:20.834
You like it, you had a good
time?

03:20.934 --> 03:22.069
Good.

03:22.169 --> 03:25.473
Oh wait, hey, hey, hey, hey,
back up, back up, back up.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.575
Hey, how you doing?

03:28.909 --> 03:31.111
Olivia, that's such a pretty
name.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.246
- Thank you.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.014
- Could we take a picture,
a little selfie there?

03:34.114 --> 03:35.349
All right, get in here.

03:35.449 --> 03:36.784
How big can you smile?

03:36.884 --> 03:37.718
Yeah, there you go.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.119
Hey, that's pretty, thank you so
much.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.188
Hey, thanks for coming
out, man, I appreciate it.

03:41.289 --> 03:42.022
I appreciate it.

03:42.122 --> 03:42.856
Hey, everybody get in here,

03:42.956 --> 03:43.757
let's get one big photo.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.626
Come on, hey, give him your
phone.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.495
All right, everybody
say Noah Bryan on three.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.297
One, two, three.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.098
Noah Bryan!

03:51.198 --> 03:52.032
- Woo!

03:53.100 --> 03:54.067
All right.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.135
- That was amazing.

03:55.235 --> 03:55.969
- How you feeling?

03:56.069 --> 03:58.272
- Good, I'm feeling good.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.207
- That was the best one yet,
Noah.

04:00.308 --> 04:01.208
- Oh, yeah.

04:01.309 --> 04:02.343
- Keep it up, people are
noticing, man.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.344
- They love me.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.278
They love me.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.479
- Now you back that up a little
bit.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.648
Let's not get the cart
before the horse here, right?

04:07.748 --> 04:08.782
- Have a beer.

04:08.882 --> 04:09.917
- What you supposed to
mean by that, Larry?

04:10.017 --> 04:11.084
What's that mean?

04:11.184 --> 04:13.053
- Well, it means you gotta stay
humble.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.288
- I'm humble, man, come on.

04:14.388 --> 04:17.257
- Don't forget, pride always
comes before the fall.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.593
I've seen it before, know what
I'm talking about, alight?

04:19.693 --> 04:21.729
- You ain't getting religious
on me, are you Larry?

04:21.829 --> 04:23.564
- Just talking the truth, kid.

04:23.664 --> 04:26.133
- Oh, I think we should
celebrate.

04:26.233 --> 04:27.835
- Now I think you need to slow
that down.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.703
We got a whole lot more touring
to go.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.539
- You can suit yourself.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.006
- Just looking out for you.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.143
- I got this, man.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.704
- I need to get some gas, boss.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.005
- Can you grab me something
to drink in there, please?

05:05.105 --> 05:05.906
Thank you.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.107
- Non-alcoholic.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.588
How you doing, kid?

05:20.688 --> 05:21.955
- What's that?

05:22.055 --> 05:23.791
- Doing all right, you feeling
good?

05:25.158 --> 05:28.095
- Yeah, yeah I feel real
good, yeah, thank you.

05:30.230 --> 05:31.699
- How are your parents doing?

05:33.300 --> 05:34.668
- My parents?

05:34.768 --> 05:39.773
Uh, they're good as far as I
know, still working the farm.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.877
I'd love to be able to
hire 'em a couple hands

05:43.977 --> 05:45.646
if I could, you know?

05:45.746 --> 05:47.080
- Now that's a good son right
there.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.315
- Yeah, well according to my
daddy,

05:48.416 --> 05:50.618
a good son would have stayed
on the farm to help out.

05:50.718 --> 05:53.153
- You got a gift kid, truly.

05:54.321 --> 05:57.157
A whole lot of people would give
anything

05:57.257 --> 06:01.462
to be able to sing and play
the way you do, God-given.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.267
- I wish you'd tell my daddy
that.

06:13.407 --> 06:16.477
- Lord, we thank you for this
day.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.745
Thanks for blessing our food.

06:17.845 --> 06:20.047
In Jesus' name, Amen.

06:20.147 --> 06:20.981
- Amen.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.455
Just listen to one of his songs.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.659
It'd mean the world to him and
to me.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.326
- I'm not gonna change my mind.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.630
- God knows he's just like you.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.593
* 40 days and 40 nights

07:05.693 --> 07:08.662
* Haven't heard from you in
awhile *

07:08.762 --> 07:13.734
* These tears won't let
up, they just rain down *

07:15.368 --> 07:18.171
* All these feelings, like a
flood *

07:18.271 --> 07:20.808
* Are up against me, rising up

07:20.908 --> 07:24.044
- You need to read this, Noah
James Bryan.

07:24.144 --> 07:27.380
- Come on, Larry, this ain't
the first time someone's

07:27.481 --> 07:29.282
claimed I was their baby daddy.

07:29.382 --> 07:31.084
- It's the first time a lawyer
has said it

07:31.184 --> 07:33.420
and they want you to
take a paternity test.

07:33.521 --> 07:36.089
* The only thing that's called

07:36.189 --> 07:38.792
* Girl, you ain't calling me

07:38.892 --> 07:42.229
* When it rains I pour
me another shot of us *

07:42.329 --> 07:44.231
- I don't even know Charlene
Meyers, man.

07:44.331 --> 07:47.501
Look at this, JJ short for
Jeremiah James,

07:47.601 --> 07:49.169
that's my daddy's name, okay?

07:49.269 --> 07:51.672
They could have been a little
less obvious than that.

07:51.772 --> 07:52.773
That's a fake, brother.

07:52.873 --> 07:55.442
* Drowning my pain down memory
lane *

07:55.543 --> 07:59.046
* Every sip hangs on a bitter
taste *

07:59.146 --> 08:00.581
* I'm missing your lips

08:00.681 --> 08:01.615
* This out of body

08:01.715 --> 08:03.917
- Look man, I know it's a lot to
take in

08:05.085 --> 08:06.754
but if the child is yours,

08:06.854 --> 08:09.022
with the mother having passed
away,

08:09.122 --> 08:10.624
you're the legal guardian.

08:10.724 --> 08:14.061
* When it rains, I pour

08:19.833 --> 08:20.568
Thank you.

08:20.668 --> 08:21.569
Love you, Biloxi.

08:21.669 --> 08:22.770
- Great job, guys.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.337
We take off 07:00 tomorrow.

08:24.437 --> 08:25.639
- Good job, man.

08:25.739 --> 08:26.874
- Hey, come here Noah,
I wanna talk to you.

08:26.974 --> 08:27.708
- What?

08:27.808 --> 08:28.542
- Have a seat.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.610
- What?

08:29.710 --> 08:31.845
- Look, I spoke to the attorney
today.

08:31.945 --> 08:34.582
He wants you to take a
paternity test right away.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.016
If the kid's not yours, you can
move on.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.150
- It's not.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.152
- Well but if it is, you
need to deal with it, man.

08:39.252 --> 08:40.520
- I'm not doing it.

08:40.621 --> 08:41.354
What do you
mean you're not doing it?

08:41.454 --> 08:42.355
- I'm not doing it.

08:42.455 --> 08:43.056
You need to take care
of this

08:43.156 --> 08:43.991
before it gets any bigger.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.726
- I didn't see your name on the
pap-

08:45.826 --> 08:47.127
- Shh.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.196
Quiet down, we don't have
to let the whole room

08:49.296 --> 08:50.497
know about this right now.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.201
- It's not mine.

08:54.301 --> 08:57.771
- Noah, a man can only run
from himself for so long.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.175
- What does that even mean?

09:02.275 --> 09:06.580
- It means no matter where
you go, there you are.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.584
- Well, that sounds like
another country song.

09:10.684 --> 09:11.852
I think I'll write it.

09:11.952 --> 09:12.720
- Paternity test.

09:12.820 --> 09:13.654
- Ain't doing it.

09:18.859 --> 09:19.960
That wasn't so bad.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.194
- That's easy for you to say,

09:21.294 --> 09:24.497
that lady just about tickled
my tonsils with that swab.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.234
- Hey, we leave in an hour, man.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.637
- Going to Little Rock?

09:29.737 --> 09:30.904
- Little Rock.

09:32.372 --> 09:33.373
- Alright.

09:33.473 --> 09:34.374
- You okay?

09:35.375 --> 09:37.210
- Yeah, I'm all right.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.413
- Look, Noah,

09:41.281 --> 09:43.283
I know that your
relationship with your father

09:43.383 --> 09:44.885
isn't the best right now,

09:44.985 --> 09:47.520
and you may even be afraid to be
a dad,

09:47.621 --> 09:50.624
it's a huge responsibility,
but worth every minute.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.663
- I do remember her.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.097
- What's that?

09:57.197 --> 09:59.466
- Charlie, JJ's mom.

10:01.534 --> 10:05.238
She was different than
the rest, you know, she,

10:06.974 --> 10:08.976
she was the kind you write a
song about.

10:10.410 --> 10:11.244
- What happened?

10:13.213 --> 10:14.047
- I don't know.

10:15.315 --> 10:18.686
I mean, she, she was always
backstage,

10:18.786 --> 10:20.420
that little honky talk
remember we used to play at

10:20.520 --> 10:21.588
outside Fayetteville?

10:23.256 --> 10:26.059
I don't know, one day she
just, she never came back.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.495
I never heard from her again.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.701
- Well, either way, God has a
plan.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.807
- I hope you're right, Larry.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.220
You
sure you wanna do this?

10:53.320 --> 10:54.321
- He's a great kid.

11:00.828 --> 11:03.096
JJ, you're gonna come
stay with me for a while.

11:03.196 --> 11:03.931
Would you like that?

11:04.031 --> 11:05.799
- I miss my mom.

11:06.900 --> 11:07.868
- I know, sweetie.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.570
Thanks, bye.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.072
- It's just until we
can establish paternity

11:12.172 --> 11:14.307
unless other family surfaces.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.809
- I know.

11:15.909 --> 11:16.744
- Okay.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.747
- All right, you ready?

11:47.107 --> 11:48.675
- Well, here we go.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.748
You want me to open it?

11:56.349 --> 11:58.185
- No, no, I can do it.

12:08.628 --> 12:09.662
I need a drink first.

12:09.763 --> 12:11.531
- No, no, no, no, have a seat,
Noah,

12:11.631 --> 12:13.566
that's not a good idea.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.175
- I can't do it, you do it.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.991
Come on, what is it?

12:38.091 --> 12:39.259
- Congratulations.

12:39.359 --> 12:43.130
- Yes, I told you I wasn't
that kid's daddy, I told you.

12:45.899 --> 12:49.870
You mean congratulations I'm
not the kid's father, right?

12:49.970 --> 12:51.404
- I'm sorry you feel that way.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.883
- It's over, man, it's over.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.618
This ruins, it's over, my
career's over,

13:05.718 --> 13:07.287
you understand that, right, this
is done?

13:07.387 --> 13:08.121
- No, no, no, no.

13:08.221 --> 13:08.956
This could be a good thing.

13:09.056 --> 13:09.789
- For who?

13:09.890 --> 13:10.790
- Both of you.

13:10.891 --> 13:11.959
- I don't know how to be a
daddy, Larry.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.994
I mean, I can ruin his life.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.764
- It's either you or foster
care.

13:17.865 --> 13:18.598
- I need a drink, man.

13:18.698 --> 13:19.666
- Have a seat, brother.

13:20.600 --> 13:24.037
Look, I don't blame you, this is
tough,

13:24.137 --> 13:26.206
but getting blind drunk ain't
the answer.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.308
- You got a better idea?

13:41.754 --> 13:43.957
- Boy, where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

13:44.892 --> 13:45.926
- My daddy taught me.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.797
'Bout the only thing we could
agree on,

13:50.898 --> 13:51.999
well that and fishing.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.168
- Feeling better?

13:57.104 --> 13:58.972
- No, not really.

14:01.708 --> 14:02.609
What do we do now?

14:03.810 --> 14:08.015
- Well, I reckon it's
time you met your son.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.851
Put some of the tour dates on
hold

14:11.952 --> 14:14.754
to give us time to figure this
out.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.025
- Hi, Noah.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.260
This is Leann Harris from the
Child Protection Services.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.630
We wanna discuss your meeting
with JJ.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.832
We normally do the first
meeting at the facility,

14:25.933 --> 14:28.501
but since it's still pretty new
to him,

14:28.601 --> 14:30.703
we just wanna keep him as
comfortable as possible.

14:30.803 --> 14:34.541
So we would like to have
the meeting at the house.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.048
- Hey, buddy, I'm, I'm,

14:42.549 --> 14:46.453
hey JJ, I'm your, I'm your dad.

14:47.354 --> 14:48.821
Come on, it's not that,
it's gonna be all right,

14:48.922 --> 14:50.157
it's not that big of a deal,

14:50.257 --> 14:53.060
you just tell him who you
are and he says who he is

14:53.160 --> 14:56.997
and hey, hey, nice to meet you,
JJ.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.499
There it is, see that's it,
you're fine.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.705
- You must be Noah.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.274
Hi, I'm Leann.

15:07.374 --> 15:10.443
- Oh, hey, it's, it's nice to
meet you.

15:10.543 --> 15:14.681
- I saw you standing at the
door for the past few minutes.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.783
- Oh, sorry, I was,

15:16.883 --> 15:18.952
I was just trying to, I don't
know-

15:19.052 --> 15:21.088
- Don't worry, it happens to
most.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.090
- Okay, that's good, good.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.557
- Are you ready to meet him?

15:25.658 --> 15:27.827
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.229
- Come on in.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.297
All right, thank you.

15:30.397 --> 15:31.231
- You're welcome.

15:32.865 --> 15:36.869
You want something to
drink, water, coffee, tea?

15:36.970 --> 15:39.439
- No, no, I'm okay, thank you
though.

15:39.539 --> 15:40.673
- Alright.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.942
Yeah, JJ's quite the artist.

15:44.211 --> 15:47.314
- Yeah that's, that's really
good.

15:47.414 --> 15:48.715
- Yeah.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.683
He's in his room, I can go get
him.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.986
- Well, I got, I got this for
JJ.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.721
- Why don't you give that to
him?

15:55.655 --> 15:58.091
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

15:58.191 --> 15:58.925
- Okay.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.793
- I'll be right back.

16:16.543 --> 16:19.046
- I hope so, Larry, I hope so.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.651
- JJ, this is the person
I was telling you about.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.419
Can you say hi to Mr. Bryan?

16:26.519 --> 16:27.720
- Hi, Mr. Bryan.

16:27.820 --> 16:28.721
- Hey there, JJ.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.291
How you doing?

16:31.391 --> 16:32.125
- Good.

16:32.225 --> 16:32.959
- It's nice to meet you.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.227
- Nice to meet you, too.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.831
- Well, I got you something.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.067
- What do you say?

16:40.167 --> 16:41.134
- Thank you.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.269
- You're welcome.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.637
Do you need help?

16:45.705 --> 16:46.539
- Yeah.

16:48.141 --> 16:50.077
- There you go.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.010
What is it?

16:51.111 --> 16:52.779
- LEGOS, love LEGOS.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.348
- Oh good, good, I'm glad.

16:55.448 --> 16:56.883
Good choice.

16:56.983 --> 16:58.385
- Well, I wish I could take
credit,

16:58.485 --> 17:00.287
the lady at the store
recommended it.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.821
- Come on, let's play.

17:01.921 --> 17:04.091
- Oh, you're busy now.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.560
- Okay, well, I guess
we're gonna play LEGOS.

17:07.660 --> 17:08.995
- Yep.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.166
Well, how'd it go?

17:13.266 --> 17:14.901
- It was good, it was good.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.769
We're supposed to have
another meeting tomorrow.

17:20.573 --> 17:21.508
I'm scared, Larry.

17:22.975 --> 17:25.078
- Being a parent can be very
intimidating.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.381
- How'd you do it?

17:29.316 --> 17:33.753
- Well, I didn't do it by
myself.

17:36.022 --> 17:39.959
My wife, God bless her.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.062
She was the anchor.

17:45.698 --> 17:47.167
- I don't have a wife, Larry.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.703
- No, but you got your parents

17:51.704 --> 17:54.006
and a whole lot of people
that care about you.

17:57.844 --> 18:01.013
So when did you
first start playing music?

18:01.114 --> 18:03.416
- First picked up a guitar
when I was like five.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.051
- Wow, that's impressive.

18:05.152 --> 18:06.119
- Yeah.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.788
I found my dad's old guitar

18:08.888 --> 18:10.790
hidden away in the back of the
barn.

18:10.890 --> 18:11.724
- Hidden?

18:12.859 --> 18:14.861
- Yeah, I guess he used to play,
but he,

18:15.895 --> 18:17.797
you know, he didn't
really want that for me.

18:17.897 --> 18:18.931
- Oh.

18:19.031 --> 18:21.334
- Just kind of wanted me
to stay and work the farm.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.503
- Well, he must be very proud of
you now.

18:25.138 --> 18:26.072
- Not really.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.340
- What about your mom?

18:27.440 --> 18:29.309
- Now my mama, she's my biggest
fan.

18:29.409 --> 18:30.443
- I bet she is.

18:32.512 --> 18:33.580
So any siblings?

18:34.747 --> 18:35.948
- Uh...

18:39.051 --> 18:42.155
Yeah, I don't usually talk about
it.

18:42.255 --> 18:42.989
- Oh.

18:43.089 --> 18:43.823
- I'm sorry.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.992
- Oh, no, yeah, of course.

18:46.092 --> 18:48.961
- I'm hungry, when is my food
coming?

18:49.061 --> 18:50.163
- Well, hey, I got an idea.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.164
I'm just throwing it out there,

18:51.264 --> 18:52.799
what if we just skip breakfast
altogether

18:52.899 --> 18:54.567
and we go get us some ice cream?

18:54.667 --> 18:55.902
- What flavor?

18:56.002 --> 18:57.337
- What's your favorite flavor?

18:57.437 --> 18:58.738
- Chocolate.

18:58.838 --> 18:59.939
- That's my favorite flavor.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.708
- Okay, well, let's have
some breakfast first,

19:01.808 --> 19:04.644
and then I know the perfect
place to take you guys.

19:04.744 --> 19:05.645
- Here you go, young man.

19:05.745 --> 19:06.979
- Oh, there it is.
- Thank you.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.047
- And I'll have yours right up.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.517
- All right, you just,
you solved it for us.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.819
I was hoping for ice cream
though, man.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.527
* You can use it

19:20.627 --> 19:22.094
* You can spend it

19:22.195 --> 19:24.030
* You can waste it

19:24.130 --> 19:25.532
* But why would you want to

19:25.632 --> 19:26.833
* Each second

19:26.933 --> 19:28.301
* Every minute

19:28.401 --> 19:32.205
* Is a minute that you get to
hold onto *

19:32.305 --> 19:36.343
* And I don't want to regret
this life *

19:36.443 --> 19:40.146
* I want to spend the rest of my
time *

19:40.247 --> 19:44.551
* Being next to you

19:44.651 --> 19:49.656
* Can we stay right here forever
*

19:51.324 --> 19:55.995
* Stay right here another minute
*

19:56.095 --> 19:57.464
* What's right in front of me

19:57.564 --> 20:00.600
* Having four wheels on the
ground *

20:00.700 --> 20:03.603
* I think I'm ready to slow it
down *

20:03.703 --> 20:07.106
* Can we stay right here

20:12.779 --> 20:14.481
* No, you can't buy it

20:14.581 --> 20:16.148
* Can't rewind it

20:16.249 --> 20:19.619
* You can bottle it up
and save it for later *

20:19.719 --> 20:22.855
* It won't go to plan though

20:22.955 --> 20:26.158
* Life's for living,
can't put it on paper *

20:26.259 --> 20:30.397
* And I don't want to regret
this life *

20:30.497 --> 20:34.100
* I want to spend the rest of my
time *

20:34.200 --> 20:36.202
* Being next to you

20:36.303 --> 20:38.771
- This is fun, Mr. Bryan.

20:38.871 --> 20:42.409
- Yeah, I'm having a good time
too.

20:43.710 --> 20:44.544
Uh...

20:47.947 --> 20:51.351
I, I got something I got to tell
you.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.285
- Okay.

20:58.157 --> 20:59.459
- I'm your dad.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.500
* Can we stay right here

21:15.908 --> 21:18.411
* Right here

21:21.448 --> 21:24.417
So when are
you going back on tour?

21:24.517 --> 21:27.186
- Oh, I'm not exactly sure.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.556
I know my manager is
working on a couple dates.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.123
It could be sooner, I'll keep
you posted,

21:31.223 --> 21:32.325
I'd love for you to come out.

21:32.425 --> 21:33.360
- Yeah, that'd be fun.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.293
- Yeah.

21:35.161 --> 21:36.696
- Have you decided what you're
gonna do?

21:36.796 --> 21:38.565
- Yeah, I want him to live with
me.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.634
- Wow, you sure?

21:43.803 --> 21:44.637
- Yeah.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.574
Yeah, I'm sure.

21:50.510 --> 21:53.212
Look, I understand if you're
concerned

21:53.312 --> 21:55.214
that I might not be able to
handle it,

21:57.149 --> 21:58.351
but I want him to be with me.

21:58.451 --> 22:01.287
I mean, these last few days
have been exactly what I need.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.323
- What you need?

22:05.425 --> 22:06.926
- No, no, that's not-

22:07.026 --> 22:09.729
- This is a little boy's life
who up until a few weeks ago,

22:09.829 --> 22:11.498
had a loving mother.

22:11.598 --> 22:12.832
- That's not what I mean.

22:14.434 --> 22:15.702
I want to be his dad.

22:16.969 --> 22:18.237
I really think I'm ready.

22:20.907 --> 22:23.643
- I would love nothing more
than for you to be ready,

22:23.743 --> 22:28.080
but this precious little
boy, he needs his father.

22:28.180 --> 22:31.350
If you do this, there's no
turning back.

22:32.852 --> 22:33.686
- Yeah, I know.

22:35.488 --> 22:36.322
I know.

22:39.191 --> 22:42.862
He just, he makes me want
to be a better person.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.299
- Well, who's gonna watch
him when you're on stage

22:47.400 --> 22:49.802
or whatever it is you're out
there doing?

22:50.837 --> 22:55.542
- Uh, I don't know.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.378
- Well, what about your parents?

23:02.549 --> 23:03.382
- Uh...

23:06.719 --> 23:07.554
That's tricky.

23:23.302 --> 23:24.036
Well hi, honey.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.071
How are you?

23:25.171 --> 23:26.072
- Hey, mom.

23:28.975 --> 23:30.643
There's something I gotta tell
you.

23:37.149 --> 23:37.884
So how'd it go?

23:37.984 --> 23:39.185
- Ask me how I'm doing, Larry.

23:39.285 --> 23:40.887
- How you doing, Larry?

23:40.987 --> 23:43.189
I'm great, man, I'm
great.

23:43.289 --> 23:44.491
- Hi, hon.

23:44.591 --> 23:45.992
Hi, I'm gonna have
the breakfast special, please.

23:46.092 --> 23:46.993
- You got it, sweetheart.
- Thank you.

23:48.561 --> 23:49.562
So, what's up?

23:49.662 --> 23:51.097
- JJ's gonna come live with me.

23:51.197 --> 23:52.231
- Really?
- Yeah, man.

23:52.331 --> 23:53.700
- Oh Noah, that's great, man.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.702
- I know, I'm excited.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.537
- And you thought your career
was over?

23:57.637 --> 23:58.671
How about that?

23:58.771 --> 24:00.039
- Well, I hope I made the right
decision.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.741
Don't make me second
guess it now, come on.

24:01.841 --> 24:04.143
- You made the right decision.

24:04.243 --> 24:06.078
I got some good news, too.

24:06.178 --> 24:07.747
- Yeah, how good?

24:07.847 --> 24:09.782
- You're opening for Colt Young.

24:10.883 --> 24:11.951
- Wait what?

24:12.051 --> 24:13.385
Do you know how big this is for
us?

24:13.486 --> 24:14.521
Do you know?

24:14.621 --> 24:15.454
Whoo!

24:15.555 --> 24:16.455
Sorry.

24:16.556 --> 24:19.025
I'm going on tour with Colt
Young

24:19.125 --> 24:20.493
and I apologize to everyone,

24:20.593 --> 24:22.862
but if you want to come, let
me know, I'll get you in.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.864
Wait so when do we go?

24:24.964 --> 24:25.898
- Two weeks.

24:25.998 --> 24:27.233
- Two weeks, I knew this was
gonna happen.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.268
I knew it, I could feel it, man.

24:29.368 --> 24:30.336
Hey, can we get two beers?

24:30.436 --> 24:31.270
We celebrating.

24:32.104 --> 24:35.675
- Now I have to be very blunt
here now.

24:35.775 --> 24:37.343
You're gonna have to avoid
drinking

24:37.443 --> 24:39.979
for the duration of the tour,
top to bottom, all right?

24:40.079 --> 24:41.447
- What are you talking about,
man?

24:41.548 --> 24:42.281
Come on.

24:42.381 --> 24:43.482
- Look man,

24:43.583 --> 24:44.984
Colt Young doesn't want
anyone drinking on his tour.

24:45.084 --> 24:47.353
Besides, you're a father now.

24:56.763 --> 24:57.597
- Showtime.

25:15.548 --> 25:17.049
- All right, we're all packed.

25:19.085 --> 25:20.152
- Hey.

25:20.252 --> 25:24.290
Oh, that's a cool bear, what's
his name?

25:24.390 --> 25:27.159
- Charlie, that's my mommy's
name.

25:27.259 --> 25:30.830
- Oh, well that's a beautiful
name.

25:32.331 --> 25:34.100
- All right, you ready to go?

25:34.200 --> 25:35.367
It's okay, honey.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.505
You'll be a good boy

25:39.606 --> 25:41.774
and don't forget those prayers,
okay?

25:41.874 --> 25:45.645
- But I wanna stay with you.

25:45.745 --> 25:46.946
- And I would love that.

25:48.615 --> 25:50.416
But you get to live with Noah,
now.

25:51.450 --> 25:52.551
Okay, he's your daddy?

25:54.220 --> 25:55.822
- Okay, I love you.

26:00.092 --> 26:01.060
- I love you, too.

26:09.001 --> 26:11.170
- Are you ready to go, buddy?

26:11.270 --> 26:13.072
Hey, why don't you take
Charlie back there?

26:14.406 --> 26:15.241
There you go.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.145
You wanna grab your blue bag
there?

26:19.245 --> 26:20.680
Yeah, help him out.

26:22.181 --> 26:26.018
- Well, thanks for everything.

26:27.486 --> 26:28.487
- Yeah, of course.

26:31.123 --> 26:31.958
Take care of him.

26:34.526 --> 26:36.729
- Here I'll-
- Right, I'll get the door.

26:36.829 --> 26:38.197
- Yeah, I'll get this one.

26:38.297 --> 26:40.633
I'll get it all, I can figure it
out.

26:40.733 --> 26:41.934
- You take care, you guys.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.003
- All right, thank you.

26:44.103 --> 26:44.837
- Mmhmm.

26:44.937 --> 26:45.672
You ready?

26:45.772 --> 26:46.505
Yeah.

26:46.605 --> 26:47.439
Let's do it.

27:10.930 --> 27:13.733
Oh hey, hey Dash, come here
buddy.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.735
Come here, hey, hey, hey, how
you doing?

27:15.835 --> 27:17.236
I missed you.

27:17.336 --> 27:18.437
Oh, you okay?

27:19.271 --> 27:20.873
- Yeah, how you doing?
- It's good to see you, mom.

27:20.973 --> 27:21.774
How are you?

27:21.874 --> 27:22.875
- We don't see you for three
months

27:22.975 --> 27:24.911
and now you have a son.

27:25.745 --> 27:27.379
- Surprise.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.081
- Hi there.

27:29.181 --> 27:31.050
- Hey, come on buddy.

27:31.150 --> 27:31.884
Hey dad.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.419
- Noah.

27:33.519 --> 27:34.353
- This is-

27:36.122 --> 27:37.189
- You can say it.

27:37.289 --> 27:39.726
- That's your grandma and
that there's your grandpa.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.394
- Nice to meet you.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.629
- Nice to meet you, JJ.

27:44.530 --> 27:45.264
- Good job, buddy.

27:45.364 --> 27:47.066
- I bet you are hungry.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.268
- Can I have a grilled cheese?

27:49.368 --> 27:51.203
- Oh why yes you can.

27:51.303 --> 27:52.604
- Baby, I got to finish my
chores.

27:52.705 --> 27:54.106
- Okay.

27:54.206 --> 27:55.674
- Dash, come on.

27:55.775 --> 27:58.244
Let's get on
that grilled cheese, you.

28:00.747 --> 28:01.580
You think it's done?

28:01.680 --> 28:02.882
- Yeah.

28:02.982 --> 28:05.918
- Alright, let's give it a shot.

28:10.656 --> 28:11.557
God, that's hot.

28:11.657 --> 28:13.059
Alright, let's go.

28:13.159 --> 28:14.660
Why don't you go sit over there?

28:14.761 --> 28:17.730
Alright, go sit over there for
me.

28:17.830 --> 28:18.664
- Okay.

28:22.234 --> 28:23.502
- There you go.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.874
- Jesus, thank you for this
food.

28:28.841 --> 28:29.942
- Oh.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.744
- Amen.
- Amen.

28:38.150 --> 28:39.685
What's wrong?

28:39.786 --> 28:41.553
- It tastes yucky.

28:41.653 --> 28:42.889
- Yucky?

28:42.989 --> 28:44.323
It's not that bad.

28:44.423 --> 28:48.060
- It's not how Miss LeeAnn makes
it.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.563
- I'm sorry, buddy,
Miss LeeAnn ain't here.

28:51.663 --> 28:54.200
- You're not supposed to
talk with your mouth full.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.702
- Who told you that?

28:56.803 --> 28:57.970
- Miss LeeAnn.

28:58.905 --> 29:00.506
- Miss LeeAnn, huh?

29:01.841 --> 29:02.741
You ain't gonna eat it, are you?

29:02.842 --> 29:04.010
- No.

29:04.110 --> 29:04.877
- I don't blame you.

29:04.977 --> 29:06.879
- Oh, bless your heart.

29:06.979 --> 29:08.314
Wanna go make a proper grilled
cheese?

29:08.414 --> 29:09.415
- Yeah.

29:09.515 --> 29:10.382
- You gonna help me?

29:10.482 --> 29:11.750
- Yeah.

29:11.851 --> 29:12.684
- Oh yeah, good.

29:12.785 --> 29:13.886
- Proper, what's that supposed
to mean?

29:13.986 --> 29:16.755
- You know exactly what it
means.

29:16.856 --> 29:20.126
You, you first, it's...

29:20.226 --> 29:22.161
- It's pretty hot, isn't it?
- Hey there.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.729
I just got off the
phone.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.998
- Hold on, I can't hear you.

29:26.098 --> 29:26.933
Wait.

29:28.367 --> 29:29.869
- And then.

29:29.969 --> 29:30.870
- All right, go ahead.

29:30.970 --> 29:31.938
I just got off the
phone

29:32.038 --> 29:33.906
with Colt Young's manager.

29:34.006 --> 29:34.807
- Yeah?

29:34.907 --> 29:35.574
He's gonna be in
Branson

29:35.674 --> 29:37.176
at a studio recording tomorrow.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.244
- Okay.

29:38.344 --> 29:39.611
He wants us to
stop by for a meeting.

29:40.679 --> 29:41.814
- No yeah, I'll be there.

29:41.914 --> 29:42.748
It's only a couple
hours

29:42.849 --> 29:44.150
from your mama's place.

29:44.250 --> 29:45.351
I'll send you the address.

29:45.451 --> 29:46.853
3:00 PM I'll meet you there.

29:49.355 --> 29:50.656
- Uh...

29:53.292 --> 29:54.894
Yeah, I'm gonna be there.

29:54.994 --> 29:57.163
Okay, I'm gonna call you
on the way, all right.

29:58.564 --> 29:59.565
Hey, mama, I uh-

29:59.665 --> 30:00.833
- Yeah, I'll watch him.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.635
- How'd you hear that?

30:03.735 --> 30:04.937
- Mom's hear everything.

30:06.939 --> 30:07.974
- Can I borrow your car?

30:08.074 --> 30:09.108
- Yeah.

30:09.208 --> 30:10.709
- Thanks mama.

30:10.809 --> 30:11.810
- Now go help your dad.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.345
- No, I got-

30:13.445 --> 30:14.480
- Hey, right now.

30:14.580 --> 30:15.581
- Yes, ma'am.

30:37.904 --> 30:39.805
Good Lord.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.342
Damn.

30:54.786 --> 30:56.288
Need help?

30:56.388 --> 30:59.725
- Uh, yeah, give me a 5/8ths.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.863
- 5/8ths.

31:09.568 --> 31:10.302
Appreciate it.

31:10.402 --> 31:11.470
- Yeah, yeah.

31:13.839 --> 31:14.907
How you been?

31:15.874 --> 31:19.178
- Well the good Lord sees
fit in keeping me breathing

31:19.278 --> 31:21.948
so I reckon I'm doing all right.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.983
- Could be worse, I guess.

31:24.083 --> 31:24.951
Yep.

31:27.119 --> 31:28.787
- What's wrong with it this
time?

31:29.821 --> 31:30.990
- Spark plugs.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.293
Anything else?

31:34.393 --> 31:35.694
- I don't know yet.

31:38.597 --> 31:39.431
- Okay, then.

31:41.533 --> 31:42.634
- Okay, then.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.922
- Hey, what's going on, buddy?

32:37.756 --> 32:38.991
- I'm scared.

32:40.559 --> 32:42.961
- It's just thunder, it's all
right.

32:43.829 --> 32:45.864
- I'm scared, can I sleep with
you?

32:48.134 --> 32:51.670
- Uh, yeah, yeah of course,
buddy.

32:54.773 --> 32:55.841
I'll keep you safe.

32:58.277 --> 32:59.611
- I love you, daddy.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.083
- I love you too, buddy.

33:30.576 --> 33:34.413
- I gotta go number two.

33:34.513 --> 33:35.681
- What?

33:35.781 --> 33:37.283
- I gotta go poop.

33:39.785 --> 33:41.087
- Are you done yet?

33:41.187 --> 33:43.722
Oh, what in world did you eat,
buddy?

33:43.822 --> 33:45.057
- Lots of things.

33:45.157 --> 33:46.358
- I know, it's just a figure of
speech.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.094
- What's a figure of speech?

33:53.165 --> 33:53.999
- Mama!

33:55.067 --> 33:55.901
Mom!

33:57.536 --> 33:59.037
All right so after you
get the bread, then what?

33:59.138 --> 34:00.306
- You butter it.

34:00.406 --> 34:01.240
- Okay.

34:02.108 --> 34:03.942
Is it a lot of butter?

34:04.042 --> 34:05.344
- Just a little bit.

34:05.444 --> 34:06.912
- Just to cover it?

34:07.012 --> 34:09.781
- Look, you're having
grilled cheese for breakfast.

34:09.881 --> 34:11.950
- That's all I know how to make,
mama.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.086
- Kind of looks like JJ's making
it.

34:14.186 --> 34:15.887
- Oh, you're so funny.

34:15.987 --> 34:18.757
Okay, so once you butter
it, then what do you do?

34:18.857 --> 34:21.260
- You get the cheese.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.762
Grilled cheese,
all right, that makes sense.

34:24.796 --> 34:26.098
What, you ain't gonna help us?

34:26.198 --> 34:27.966
- Oh, it looks like you got
this.

34:29.701 --> 34:30.936
- You're not getting one.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.148
All right, this is it.

34:42.248 --> 34:43.849
This is it, it's the moment
you've been waiting for.

34:43.949 --> 34:45.717
You've got this, all right.

34:47.052 --> 34:49.655
Hey, hey there Colt,
it's nice to meet you.

34:49.755 --> 34:50.889
I'm Noah, I'm a big fan of
yours,

34:50.989 --> 34:52.090
have all your music.

34:54.126 --> 34:56.795
Hey there, Mr. Young, big fan of
yours.

34:59.565 --> 35:00.432
Howdy.

35:00.532 --> 35:01.867
No howdy, that's a lot.

35:06.004 --> 35:07.439
Give me a heart attack,
Larry, come on man.

35:07.539 --> 35:08.874
- Hey man, you ready?

35:08.974 --> 35:10.309
- Yeah, yeah.
- You good?

35:10.409 --> 35:11.210
- Well how do I look?

35:11.310 --> 35:12.478
You look good, let's
go.

35:12.578 --> 35:13.312
- You wearing that?

35:13.412 --> 35:14.246
- I'm wearing this.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.416
* Find a spot out in a field

35:17.516 --> 35:19.918
* Talk to God 'bout what is real
*

35:20.018 --> 35:22.621
* When I pray sometimes I kneel
*

35:22.721 --> 35:27.693
* Sometimes I drive, yeah

35:29.961 --> 35:34.933
* Sometimes I drive, yeah

35:35.401 --> 35:37.903
* In the middle of nowhere *

35:38.003 --> 35:40.406
* You take me somewhere

35:40.506 --> 35:44.876
* You take me somewhere

35:44.976 --> 35:47.145
* Gonna roll the windows down

35:47.246 --> 35:49.515
* Find some gospel, crank it
loud *

35:49.615 --> 35:54.586
* Sing it loud, fly away, oh
glory *

35:54.686 --> 35:56.955
* Find a spot out in a field

35:57.055 --> 35:59.491
* Talk to God 'bout what is real
*

35:59.591 --> 36:02.228
* When I pray, sometimes I kneel
*

36:02.328 --> 36:05.397
* Sometimes I drive

36:08.367 --> 36:09.134
- That's a keeper.

36:09.235 --> 36:10.369
Oh, thank you, man.

36:10.469 --> 36:12.037
Hey, you just
had some company come in.

36:12.137 --> 36:12.971
- Oh good deal.

36:13.071 --> 36:15.073
Hey, y'all come on in, send 'em
in.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.942
- All right guys, I'll take
you through right this way.

36:17.042 --> 36:18.444
- After you there, Lar.

36:21.247 --> 36:22.681
- Colt, Larry and Noah here to
see you.

36:22.781 --> 36:23.582
- Hey, Larry.

36:23.682 --> 36:26.252
- Hey, hey, long time, long
time.

36:26.352 --> 36:28.387
Man, you look great for an old
codger.

36:28.487 --> 36:31.690
- Yeah, I got socks older than
you and don't you forget it.

36:31.790 --> 36:32.991
- You must be Noah.

36:33.091 --> 36:33.825
- How you doing?

36:33.925 --> 36:34.660
Nice to meet you, Mr. Young.

36:34.760 --> 36:35.627
- Oh, do not call me Mr. Young.

36:35.727 --> 36:36.928
That makes me feel almost as old
as him.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.430
- Yeah, he is ancient.

36:38.530 --> 36:39.498
He told me to say that, by the
way.

36:39.598 --> 36:40.399
- Okay.

36:40.499 --> 36:41.567
Can I get y'all something to
drink?

36:41.667 --> 36:43.735
- How 'bout some of that sweet
tea?

36:43.835 --> 36:44.670
- Whiskey.

36:46.071 --> 36:46.905
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

36:47.005 --> 36:47.806
I know, I'm kidding.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.007
Sweet tea, water, whatever you
got.

36:49.107 --> 36:51.009
- Brenda, can you bring
us some sweet tea, please?

36:51.109 --> 36:52.110
- Absolutely, you got it.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.379
- Awesome, thank you so much.

36:53.479 --> 36:54.913
- Thanks, Brenda.

36:55.013 --> 36:55.747
- I'm glad you're here.

36:55.847 --> 36:56.582
I love your music.

36:56.682 --> 36:57.816
- Thank you.

36:57.916 --> 36:58.650
- Brought you here just to see
if we fit.

36:58.750 --> 36:59.685
- Yeah, I get that.

36:59.785 --> 37:00.919
- I love this man, he's done a
lot for me.

37:01.019 --> 37:02.888
He even managed me for a little
while.

37:02.988 --> 37:04.189
- You didn't tell me that,
Larry, come on.

37:04.290 --> 37:05.557
- That was years ago.

37:06.425 --> 37:07.926
- There's no drinking on this
tour,

37:08.026 --> 37:10.228
to be blunt, my label
is not gonna have it.

37:10.329 --> 37:11.263
- Yeah, I understand.

37:11.363 --> 37:13.532
- I don't think you
have to worry about him.

37:13.632 --> 37:16.768
- Yeah, if I'm being totally
honest,

37:16.868 --> 37:18.537
I have been known to have a
drink or two,

37:18.637 --> 37:21.907
but I can assure you that
that's all behind me now.

37:22.007 --> 37:23.375
- Good, good.

37:23.475 --> 37:27.045
- Actually, I just just
found out I have a son, so.

37:27.145 --> 37:28.480
- That's really good.

37:28.580 --> 37:31.283
Family's great, it reminds
you of what's important.

37:31.383 --> 37:32.784
So let's talk about this
over some sweet tea,

37:32.884 --> 37:33.719
how about that?

37:33.819 --> 37:34.553
- Let's do it, let's do it.

37:34.653 --> 37:35.621
Love that song, by the way.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.323
- Thank you, man, we only
make hits around here.

37:37.423 --> 37:38.256
- Yeah.

37:39.525 --> 37:40.659
After you, darling.

37:41.527 --> 37:43.261
We did it, Larry, we did it.

37:43.362 --> 37:44.262
You kidding me?

37:44.363 --> 37:45.096
We did it.

37:45.196 --> 37:46.965
Give me some, give me some.

37:47.065 --> 37:47.866
Come here.

37:48.934 --> 37:50.201
We never hugged before this.

37:50.302 --> 37:52.638
- Look man, I'm gonna line up a
few shows

37:52.738 --> 37:55.407
to kind of smooth things out
before we do this, alright?

37:55.507 --> 37:57.343
You could use some smoothness,
all right?

37:57.443 --> 37:58.577
I'll call you tomorrow.

37:58.677 --> 38:00.546
- I think you might need the
smoothness there, brother.

38:01.580 --> 38:04.816
* You know every word, every
line *

38:04.916 --> 38:08.854
* Like a record you grew
up with and memorized me *

38:08.954 --> 38:13.124
* It's easy, you and
me, we sound so good *

38:13.224 --> 38:16.061
* We fit so right

38:16.161 --> 38:19.831
* Like a Sunday drive,
the windows rolled down *

38:19.931 --> 38:23.569
* You're my rhythm, you're my
rock, I get lost and found *

38:23.669 --> 38:27.339
* In your eyes, all the time

38:27.439 --> 38:31.410
* Can't help but love that sound
*

38:31.510 --> 38:36.181
* Want to spin you around
like a needle on vinyl *

38:36.281 --> 38:39.851
* Wearing you down like an old
love song *

38:39.951 --> 38:41.987
* Want to sing along, dance
along *

38:42.087 --> 38:47.092
* Like we never lost a beat

38:47.826 --> 38:51.196
* Over and done but we ain't
broken *

38:51.296 --> 38:54.400
* Lost in a groove, it feels so
good *

38:54.500 --> 38:59.505
* Like a favorite song
going on and on and on *

39:02.173 --> 39:04.976
* I get lost in your touch

39:05.076 --> 39:06.745
* It's a perfect beat

39:06.845 --> 39:10.281
* And your kiss is a song I sing
*

39:10.382 --> 39:14.019
* And your love is a melody

39:14.119 --> 39:17.689
* In the key of you and me

39:21.827 --> 39:22.661
Sorry.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.600
- Oh, I'll take that one.

39:28.700 --> 39:29.535
- You want that one?
- Yes.

39:29.635 --> 39:32.438
- All right there you go.
- Thank you.

39:32.538 --> 39:33.739
- Thanks for coming out.

39:33.839 --> 39:35.173
- Thanks for inviting me.

39:35.273 --> 39:36.007
- Yeah.

39:36.107 --> 39:36.842
- I'm having a good time.

39:36.942 --> 39:38.109
You're really talented.

39:39.411 --> 39:40.245
- Thank you.

39:42.347 --> 39:43.949
- So how's JJ adjusting?

39:45.016 --> 39:47.118
- Oh, he's, he's fantastic.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.887
You know he started calling me
daddy?

39:48.987 --> 39:50.021
- That's incredible.

39:50.121 --> 39:51.389
- Yeah, it's pretty cool.

39:51.490 --> 39:53.391
- I'm really glad your
parents can help out.

39:53.492 --> 39:57.295
- Yeah, I figured out pretty
quickly I needed their help.

39:59.431 --> 40:02.233
- So, any thoughts about
what you're gonna do?

40:03.769 --> 40:06.638
- Yeah, yeah, I mean I'm going
on this tour with Colt Young

40:06.738 --> 40:08.740
and Larry says this is a big
one.

40:09.575 --> 40:10.542
- What about JJ?

40:13.044 --> 40:13.912
- What about him?

40:14.846 --> 40:16.882
- Is he gonna stay on the farm?

40:16.982 --> 40:18.450
- Well yeah.

40:18.550 --> 40:21.286
- How long are you gonna be
gone?

40:22.153 --> 40:23.388
- I don't know.

40:25.123 --> 40:26.224
- Sorry.

40:26.324 --> 40:27.493
- Wait what, what happened?

40:27.593 --> 40:29.961
- No it's just that little
boy's been through so much so I.

40:31.029 --> 40:31.863
- Yeah.

40:33.398 --> 40:37.368
Look, I promise you, I'm
always gonna be there for him,

40:37.469 --> 40:38.804
okay?

40:38.904 --> 40:40.405
Always.

40:40.506 --> 40:42.908
If this tour works out like I
hope,

40:43.008 --> 40:44.142
I'll be able to buy him anything
he wants.

40:44.242 --> 40:46.344
- It's not really about
what you can buy him.

40:52.818 --> 40:54.653
Who's ready
for some line dancing?

40:54.753 --> 40:58.456
* Don't make this complicated

40:58.557 --> 40:59.424
- Shall we?

40:59.525 --> 41:00.425
- Really?

41:00.526 --> 41:01.693
- Yeah, let's do it.

41:01.793 --> 41:02.528
- Okay.

41:02.628 --> 41:03.428
- Do you know how to dance?

41:03.529 --> 41:04.262
- Yeah, do you?

41:04.362 --> 41:05.130
- No.

41:05.230 --> 41:06.197
Let's go.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.967
It's gonna be the fun,
regardless.

41:09.067 --> 41:12.203
* Give me a good song on the
radio *

41:12.303 --> 41:13.905
* Baby I'll let you lead

41:14.005 --> 41:15.741
* I'll let you hold me close

41:15.841 --> 41:19.545
* We'll go all night
in those neon lights *

41:19.645 --> 41:21.146
* I'll be buzzing on your loving
*

41:21.246 --> 41:23.181
* Got me feeling like we're
something *

41:23.281 --> 41:26.484
* You look like a good time

41:26.585 --> 41:28.153
* So don't waste mine

41:28.253 --> 41:30.088
* Yeah, don't waste mine

41:30.188 --> 41:33.592
* You look like a good time

41:33.692 --> 41:35.326
* So don't waste mine

41:35.426 --> 41:37.696
* Yeah, don't waste mine, baby

41:53.579 --> 41:54.746
- I should go.

41:56.181 --> 41:57.182
- All right.

41:58.216 --> 42:01.653
- Okay, this was fun.

42:01.753 --> 42:04.189
- Yeah, this is fun.

42:04.289 --> 42:05.123
- Come on.

42:12.564 --> 42:13.965
- Everything okay?

42:14.065 --> 42:16.401
- Yeah, yeah it's just late.

42:17.603 --> 42:19.537
- Well, thanks for coming.

42:19.638 --> 42:20.371
- Thanks for having me.

42:20.471 --> 42:22.040
I had a really good time.

42:22.140 --> 42:23.709
- I hope I see you soon.

42:25.210 --> 42:26.544
- I'd like that.

42:27.412 --> 42:29.280
- I gotta wrap up here but

42:30.148 --> 42:31.683
can I at least walk you to your
car?

42:31.783 --> 42:33.351
- Yeah, that'd be nice.

42:33.451 --> 42:35.153
- I promise I'll be good.

42:37.756 --> 42:38.724
- Hey buddy.

42:41.526 --> 42:43.228
Well, it's time to go to sleep.

42:44.195 --> 42:46.164
Oh, take your glasses off

42:48.266 --> 42:52.904
and you sleep tight and you
don't let those bedbugs bite.

42:53.004 --> 42:54.505
- When's my daddy coming home?

42:55.874 --> 42:59.945
- Oh, you miss him, don't you?

43:01.579 --> 43:03.248
Yeah, it's okay.

43:03.348 --> 43:04.249
Don't be sad.

43:05.617 --> 43:09.487
You just hold onto your bear
and you close your eyes,

43:10.689 --> 43:13.792
close your eyes and you're
gonna wake up so happy,

43:13.892 --> 43:14.893
I promise.

43:16.461 --> 43:18.129
It's all right, he's coming
back.

43:18.997 --> 43:19.731
Okay.

43:19.831 --> 43:21.466
- Don't worry.

43:30.809 --> 43:33.912
* Song on the radio

43:34.012 --> 43:34.846
Hey dad.

43:40.318 --> 43:43.288
- It has been three days, Noah.

43:44.489 --> 43:45.556
- I told you I had practice
shows.

43:48.927 --> 43:50.862
- Not even a phone call.

43:50.962 --> 43:52.363
Your mother's been worried sick
about you,

43:52.463 --> 43:54.632
your boy's been asking
about you every day.

43:55.834 --> 43:58.003
- Yeah, I told you I
had rehearsals all day

43:58.103 --> 43:59.705
and then I had shows at night.

43:59.805 --> 44:01.506
See I know you don't understand,

44:01.606 --> 44:04.475
but maybe if you came to
one show, you'd get it.

44:04.575 --> 44:07.779
- I've been too busy
working on this farm, Noah,

44:07.879 --> 44:09.848
which you should be doing.

44:12.183 --> 44:14.786
- You know just 'cause you
never had a dream, daddy,

44:16.988 --> 44:18.757
that don't mean I can't.

44:19.858 --> 44:20.959
All I ever wanted

44:22.861 --> 44:24.562
was for you to come see me play.

44:29.334 --> 44:32.670
- I ain't ever gonna come see
you play.

46:04.695 --> 46:06.131
- Joe, where you at, man?

46:06.231 --> 46:07.598
I'm 'bout to go on so

46:07.698 --> 46:10.268
I guess just call Larry whenever
you get this, all right.

46:10.368 --> 46:12.770
Noah, you're on in
five.

46:12.871 --> 46:14.605
Thanks.

46:14.705 --> 46:16.774
- Hey dad, can you talk to Joe?

46:16.875 --> 46:18.076
'Cause I'm 'bout to go on.

46:18.176 --> 46:19.477
If you talk to him, just
tell him to call Larry

46:19.577 --> 46:20.979
'cause he's got his ticket.

46:21.079 --> 46:24.515
Noah, your brother-

46:24.615 --> 46:26.017
- Where is he?

46:26.117 --> 46:30.221
Joe has been
in a bad, bad accident.

46:34.960 --> 46:36.561
- What happened?

46:36.661 --> 46:41.666
We, we
just, we just don't know.

47:35.887 --> 47:37.522
* She's in the front row

47:37.622 --> 47:39.190
* Knows how the songs goes

47:39.290 --> 47:40.358
* Repping that band shirt

47:40.458 --> 47:42.527
* Dancing like there's no
tomorrow *

47:42.627 --> 47:45.130
- We're coming up on the most
demanding part of the tour

47:45.230 --> 47:47.598
and I need you to be at
the top of your game.

47:48.466 --> 47:50.335
- You heard the crowd last
night, man, they love me.

47:50.435 --> 47:53.138
Yeah, I also heard
how pitchy you were last night.

47:53.238 --> 47:54.672
- What do you want me to say,
Larry?

47:54.772 --> 47:56.241
Tell me what to say, I'll say
it.

47:56.341 --> 47:58.910
- I want you to be sober
for this one, okay?

47:59.010 --> 48:02.981
* Let me hear you country loud

48:06.717 --> 48:10.555
- Congratulations, you finally
learned how to sing drunk.

48:11.556 --> 48:12.557
- Are you crazy man, what are
you doing?

48:12.657 --> 48:14.459
- You were supposed to
finish with the new song.

48:15.460 --> 48:16.661
- Well I wasn't feeling it.

48:16.761 --> 48:18.129
- No, you're not feeling a whole
lot of anything these days,

48:18.229 --> 48:19.064
are you?

48:21.299 --> 48:22.333
- Your tempo's off.

48:22.433 --> 48:23.234
- Tempo's fine.

48:23.334 --> 48:24.735
- He's right, that tempo was
fine.

48:24.835 --> 48:26.804
- If I say the tempo's
off, the tempo's off.

48:26.904 --> 48:27.705
- Look, that's the way
we've been playing it

48:27.805 --> 48:28.839
since the start of the tour.

48:28.940 --> 48:30.208
- Oh really, that's the
way you've been playing it

48:30.308 --> 48:31.176
since the start of the tour?

48:31.276 --> 48:32.978
That's cool 'cause you're fired.

48:33.078 --> 48:33.911
- Noah!

48:34.845 --> 48:37.648
* Raise my glass, sing a toast

48:37.748 --> 48:40.685
* To the fans I love the most

48:40.785 --> 48:41.519
I don't want to hear it from
you.

48:41.619 --> 48:42.487
- You're gonna hear it from me.

48:42.587 --> 48:43.621
Where am I supposed to find a
drummer

48:43.721 --> 48:45.490
this late in the game, huh?

48:45.590 --> 48:46.791
- My band, my rules.

48:46.891 --> 48:48.159
- Yeah, but it's my
responsibility

48:48.259 --> 48:50.728
to see to it that you give
your fans a good show.

48:53.298 --> 48:57.302
- You look good!

48:57.402 --> 49:00.638
* Country fans, country proud

49:00.738 --> 49:01.639
You'll figure it out.

49:01.739 --> 49:03.141
- Noah!

49:03.241 --> 49:04.042
- Excuse me.

49:04.142 --> 49:04.875
Have fun.

49:04.976 --> 49:05.977
- Just take five, guys.

49:32.837 --> 49:36.107
* I missed your birthday

49:36.207 --> 49:40.078
* Candles on the cake

49:40.178 --> 49:42.680
* Hold you anyways

49:42.780 --> 49:46.917
* You wish on me

49:47.018 --> 49:49.620
* I missed a lot of things

49:49.720 --> 49:53.624
* For that I'll take the blame

49:53.724 --> 49:55.726
* And I

50:03.801 --> 50:07.772
- Listen up, you're gonna
have to lighten up on the guys

50:07.872 --> 50:09.740
or this whole thing's gonna come
to an end

50:09.840 --> 50:11.309
way sooner than planned.

50:15.246 --> 50:16.347
- Did you replace him?

50:17.215 --> 50:18.649
- I talked him into staying.

50:19.817 --> 50:22.387
- Great, see I knew you'd figure
it out.

50:22.487 --> 50:24.589
- It's not my job to convince
these guys

50:24.689 --> 50:26.624
to put up with your ego.

50:26.724 --> 50:28.426
- That's exactly what your job
is.

50:31.062 --> 50:33.664
- You've become a very angry,
prideful young man lately

50:33.764 --> 50:35.600
and if you don't take a step
back...

50:37.735 --> 50:40.171
- What's gonna happen, Larry?

50:51.182 --> 50:52.283
There you go.

50:54.552 --> 50:56.454
I'll finish the rest.

51:00.958 --> 51:01.792
- Noah!

52:00.718 --> 52:02.387
* I'm not the kind of guy to
settle down *

52:02.487 --> 52:03.854
* Stop and put my roots down

52:03.954 --> 52:06.991
* Baby, I'm a runaway

52:07.091 --> 52:08.092
* Got no undercover

52:08.193 --> 52:09.560
* I'm rolling like a rolling
stone *

52:09.660 --> 52:12.062
* Never felt the need to stay

52:12.163 --> 52:17.202
* And darling, you walked into
the room *

52:17.302 --> 52:21.706
* And stopped me in my tracks

52:21.806 --> 52:24.409
* And just like that

52:24.509 --> 52:27.712
* I was dreaming 'bout
us, love and marriage *

52:27.812 --> 52:30.715
* Put a little baby in the baby
carriage *

52:30.815 --> 52:33.651
* Putting our name on an old
mailbox *

52:33.751 --> 52:36.654
* Find a big life right
near your parents *

52:36.754 --> 52:38.022
* Know it sounds weird

52:38.122 --> 52:39.557
* Know it sounds strange

52:39.657 --> 52:42.460
* Girl, you got me thinking
I'mma buy you a ring *

52:42.560 --> 52:45.563
* No place on Earth I'd rather
be *

52:45.663 --> 52:47.932
* Than with you, baby

52:48.032 --> 52:51.869
* You're my whole world, yeah

54:13.484 --> 54:16.387
Come on, kid, tour's
over.

54:16.487 --> 54:18.456
Leave me alone, Larry.

54:18.556 --> 54:21.191
Why do you do this to
yourself?

54:21.292 --> 54:23.093
I never should have
left.

54:23.193 --> 54:24.194
Left what?

54:26.030 --> 54:28.333
I left when they
needed me the most, man.

54:29.800 --> 54:32.903
Come on man, I'm
taking you back to your parents.

54:33.003 --> 54:33.838
I ain't going back,
man.

54:35.840 --> 54:38.208
Come on, we're
going back to the farm.

54:38.309 --> 54:39.209
Come on, let's go.

54:40.210 --> 54:41.746
Come on, it's alright.

54:43.648 --> 54:44.915
It's all right.

55:00.798 --> 55:02.700
Okay, call me tomorrow.

55:06.303 --> 55:08.539
- I got it, I got it.

55:15.346 --> 55:17.548
Hey, what about your
luggage?

55:42.006 --> 55:44.642
- "One quiet morning fresh and
new,

55:44.742 --> 55:46.777
mama wakes her sleepy cub.

55:46.877 --> 55:48.913
"Come look," she laughs, "it's
everywhere.

55:49.013 --> 55:51.281
God's filled the Earth with
love." "

55:51.382 --> 55:52.650
- See you later, JJ.

55:52.750 --> 55:54.785
- Come read with us, daddy.

55:57.688 --> 56:00.324
- "The ducklings waddled, Todd
was slow.

56:00.425 --> 56:02.493
He won't leave one behind."

56:02.593 --> 56:03.861
We missed you at dinner.

56:04.962 --> 56:06.196
- Yeah, I wasn't hungry.

56:07.164 --> 56:10.200
- You weren't hungry or
you were just too hungover?

56:10.300 --> 56:11.736
- What's hungover?

56:11.836 --> 56:12.570
- It's okay.

56:12.670 --> 56:13.471
It's a big grownup word

56:13.571 --> 56:15.105
that you don't need to know
about.

56:16.507 --> 56:19.209
- Noah, we have told you before

56:19.309 --> 56:21.679
we do not want that poison in
our home.

56:21.779 --> 56:23.380
- What is that supposed to mean?

56:24.348 --> 56:26.551
- Let's go in your room and
finish up.

56:26.651 --> 56:28.653
- No, no, no, don't take him.

56:28.753 --> 56:29.720
He started it in front of him,

56:29.820 --> 56:32.022
no, let him finish it.
- Hey, you stop it.

56:34.859 --> 56:36.093
- You want to drink?

56:36.193 --> 56:37.161
Is that what you want to do?

56:37.261 --> 56:39.063
You want to stay out
all hours of the night?

56:39.163 --> 56:40.097
Well go ahead.

56:40.197 --> 56:43.701
But if you do, you won't be
staying here,

56:43.801 --> 56:45.903
that is what it means.

56:46.003 --> 56:48.138
And you, hey, you,

56:49.740 --> 56:52.376
you have a responsibility
to that little boy.

56:54.512 --> 56:56.914
- Nothing ever changes
with you, does it, daddy?

56:58.449 --> 56:59.183
Oh, can you do this?

56:59.283 --> 57:00.017
Can you do that?

57:00.117 --> 57:00.951
Oh, that's-

57:01.051 --> 57:01.886
- Enough!

57:04.388 --> 57:08.258
You will not disrespect me or
your mama

57:08.358 --> 57:10.895
underneath our own roof, or
anybody else's for that matter.

57:10.995 --> 57:13.397
You left this family when
your brother Joe died

57:13.498 --> 57:14.899
when we needed you the most

57:14.999 --> 57:17.635
to go chasing some kind of pipe
dream.

57:22.507 --> 57:24.141
- You think this is a pipe
dream?

57:25.109 --> 57:26.443
- You don't get it, do you?

57:27.545 --> 57:28.278
- No.

57:28.378 --> 57:30.247
- Do you have any idea

57:30.347 --> 57:32.850
the burden that you have put on
your mama?

57:33.784 --> 57:37.387
You come strolling back into
our lives with a little boy,

57:37.488 --> 57:38.388
a little boy,

57:38.489 --> 57:40.124
because you weren't responsible
enough

57:40.224 --> 57:43.961
and now you want our help, is
that it?

57:47.464 --> 57:48.599
You think that's funny?

57:49.567 --> 57:52.402
Hey, hey, where you going?

57:52.503 --> 57:53.838
- Out from under your roof.

57:54.905 --> 57:56.406
- You...

58:03.347 --> 58:07.184
Father God, just please
give me the strength.

58:08.886 --> 58:13.891
* Yeah, yeah

58:14.091 --> 58:17.127
* So I'll buy a drink and grab a
stool *

58:17.227 --> 58:20.698
* Say hello, keeping my cool

58:20.798 --> 58:24.134
* Eyes on you

58:24.234 --> 58:26.771
* And I'll let the girls
make their rounds *

58:26.871 --> 58:30.207
* But I'll be hanging out over
here *

58:30.307 --> 58:31.341
* They'll be

58:31.441 --> 58:33.844
* Drinking their beer
- Lisa, I need one more.

58:33.944 --> 58:36.113
- Don't you think you've had
enough, Noah?

58:36.213 --> 58:36.947
- No.

58:37.047 --> 58:38.683
- I think you need some coffee.

58:38.783 --> 58:42.419
- Okay, just put whisky in it.

58:42.519 --> 58:46.390
* I'll be sipping on you

58:46.490 --> 58:48.993
- Don't you roll your eyes at
me, Lisa.

58:55.700 --> 58:57.702
- Give it up for Nora Collins.

59:02.506 --> 59:05.142
Who else is feeling brave
tonight?

59:05.242 --> 59:05.976
- Could I get a beer?

59:06.076 --> 59:07.244
- In a minute.

59:08.746 --> 59:10.247
That one's on the house.

59:10.347 --> 59:13.751
- I love you, I love you, I love
you.

59:15.586 --> 59:16.420
Mmm.

59:18.222 --> 59:19.456
- You're Noah Bryan.

59:19.556 --> 59:20.925
- No.

59:21.025 --> 59:21.759
- I love your music.

59:21.859 --> 59:22.593
What are you doing here?

59:22.693 --> 59:23.527
- Thank you.

59:23.628 --> 59:26.263
I was just, I was having a few
drinks.

59:26.363 --> 59:29.299
- Oh, is that Noah Bryan
at the bar over there?

59:29.399 --> 59:32.302
Who wants Noah to come sing us a
song?

59:32.402 --> 59:33.503
Please, sing a song for
me.

59:33.604 --> 59:35.840
- Sorry.

59:35.940 --> 59:37.541
- Here he comes.

59:37.642 --> 59:39.910
Let's give it up, Noah Bryan,
everybody.

59:45.816 --> 59:46.651
Oh sure.

59:48.218 --> 59:50.420
- Uh, I don't have a guitar.

59:50.520 --> 59:51.355
- You can use mine.

59:51.455 --> 59:53.223
- Wow, you're so nice, that was
good.

59:53.323 --> 59:54.324
- Thank you so much.

59:54.424 --> 59:55.225
- You're welcome.

59:55.325 --> 59:57.061
- Oh, he's really cute in
person.

59:58.595 --> 59:59.563
- Whatever.

59:59.664 --> 01:00:01.699
- One more time, let's
make him feel welcome.

01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:04.368
It's Noah Bryan.

01:00:12.009 --> 01:00:17.014
- Okay, I'll sing a I'll sing
a song off my new record.

01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:18.148
Is that okay with you?

01:00:18.248 --> 01:00:19.516
You're okay?

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:20.484
Okay.

01:00:21.786 --> 01:00:25.389
Oh sorry, this ain't
my guitar so it's hard,

01:00:25.489 --> 01:00:26.757
it's weird to play.

01:00:26.857 --> 01:00:28.959
Is this in standard tuning?

01:00:29.059 --> 01:00:29.794
- Yes.

01:00:29.894 --> 01:00:30.728
- It sounds weird.

01:00:31.896 --> 01:00:32.863
Hold on one second.

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:39.870
* You know every word, every
line *

01:00:44.608 --> 01:00:45.676
* Sing

01:00:45.776 --> 01:00:49.914
Oh sorry, my voice is a
little tired from touring.

01:00:50.014 --> 01:00:51.381
- You mean from drinking?

01:00:52.249 --> 01:00:55.085
- No, no, I meant from the tour.

01:00:55.185 --> 01:00:56.821
Thank you for your input.

01:00:56.921 --> 01:00:58.022
- Oh dear, don't.

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:01.992
- Maybe the acoustics
ain't too good back there.

01:01:02.092 --> 01:01:04.428
- Okay, well you're gonna
need to talk to the sound guy,

01:01:04.528 --> 01:01:05.896
not me.

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:10.334
* You know every word, every
line *

01:01:10.434 --> 01:01:13.537
* Like a

01:01:13.637 --> 01:01:16.073
- Nope, worse up front.

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:18.943
- Maybe it's just your
shirt there, brother.

01:01:19.043 --> 01:01:20.677
That thing's weird.

01:01:20.778 --> 01:01:21.578
- Now get off the stage.

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:22.512
You're terrible.

01:01:24.148 --> 01:01:27.718
- Okay, all right, man,
that's not a terrible idea.

01:01:27.818 --> 01:01:30.620
Who, do I give this to you or?

01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:31.555
I can take it.

01:01:31.655 --> 01:01:33.557
- Okay, you really were good
though.

01:01:33.657 --> 01:01:34.458
- So nice to meet you.

01:01:34.558 --> 01:01:37.061
- No, it was nice to meet you.

01:01:42.933 --> 01:01:44.001
- Bye bye, Noah Bryan.

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:50.674
Hey!

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:28.678
- I'm pretty sure I won, though.

01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:33.383
Are those your boots?

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:34.751
- Yep, those are boots.

01:02:34.852 --> 01:02:35.652
Get in the car.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:36.686
- I like it.
- Get in.

01:02:36.787 --> 01:02:38.288
- Ow, ow, my hair!

01:02:40.024 --> 01:02:40.858
Ow!

01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:42.893
Hey!

01:02:45.229 --> 01:02:46.430
Can you get me a beer?

01:02:49.733 --> 01:02:50.968
I need a beer.

01:02:57.641 --> 01:02:59.576
- You haven't said a word
the whole drive over.

01:03:01.078 --> 01:03:02.546
- There ain't nothing to say.

01:03:05.149 --> 01:03:06.283
- How 'bout thanks?

01:03:08.318 --> 01:03:09.186
- Thanks, Larry.

01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:12.356
- You know you really should be
grateful

01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:14.324
I was able to get you out on a
Saturday.

01:03:15.259 --> 01:03:16.160
This isn't funny.

01:03:18.728 --> 01:03:19.563
You should be grateful

01:03:19.663 --> 01:03:20.965
I was able to get you out on a
Saturday

01:03:21.065 --> 01:03:23.500
because the other guy
didn't wanna press charges.

01:03:27.237 --> 01:03:28.372
The label called.

01:03:28.472 --> 01:03:32.776
- Let me guess, they don't
want me on the tour anymore.

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:36.646
- They have a reputation to
protect, Noah.

01:03:38.515 --> 01:03:40.284
And it took a favor from a good
friend

01:03:40.384 --> 01:03:41.751
to get you that interview.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.889
They handed you the biggest
break

01:03:44.989 --> 01:03:45.822
of your career.
- What do you want me to say,

01:03:45.923 --> 01:03:46.756
Larry?

01:03:46.857 --> 01:03:48.492
- You just threw it out the
window.

01:03:48.592 --> 01:03:50.460
You need to deal with whatever
it is

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.329
that's we messing you up.
- Are we done?

01:03:52.429 --> 01:03:55.665
- Yeah, yeah Noah, we're done.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:59.036
I think it's time you
found another manager.

01:04:01.538 --> 01:04:02.539
- That's no problem.

01:04:03.941 --> 01:04:05.442
- It's no problem, huh?

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:07.644
You're still being prideful.

01:04:07.744 --> 01:04:09.079
I've warned you about that.

01:04:10.447 --> 01:04:11.381
- I don't need your God stuff.

01:04:11.481 --> 01:04:13.250
- That's exactly what you need,
right now.

01:04:47.284 --> 01:04:49.219
My, my, where have you
been?

01:04:49.319 --> 01:04:50.154
- Daddy!

01:04:52.122 --> 01:04:54.024
- What happened to you?

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.328
Noah, where's my car?

01:04:59.329 --> 01:05:00.164
Noah!

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:10.607
- Ooh mama, your baking
sure does smell good.

01:05:12.076 --> 01:05:13.243
- Noah's back.

01:05:14.211 --> 01:05:15.379
- Where is he?

01:05:16.713 --> 01:05:17.814
- Just leave him be.

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:21.185
- What do you mean leave him be?

01:05:21.285 --> 01:05:22.119
Okay.

01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:29.126
Hey, little cowboy, what you
doing?

01:05:31.161 --> 01:05:35.565
- That's you, colors and the
rainbow.

01:06:02.459 --> 01:06:04.694
- Are you gonna put Dash in
there?

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:06.063
- Yeah.

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:15.239
- Hey, papa needs to go feed
some horses.

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:17.241
You want to go with me?

01:06:17.341 --> 01:06:18.475
Alright, come on.

01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:20.077
Come on, let's go.

01:06:22.512 --> 01:06:23.847
- Noah?

01:06:26.683 --> 01:06:27.517
Noah!

01:06:29.253 --> 01:06:30.820
What's going on in there?

01:07:15.165 --> 01:07:17.234
- God, please forgive me.

01:07:25.809 --> 01:07:27.043
Hey.

01:07:27.144 --> 01:07:28.645
- Why are you sad?

01:07:30.347 --> 01:07:32.949
- Come here, buddy, I love you.

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:35.385
- Love you, too.

01:07:56.173 --> 01:07:59.109
- You ready to discuss what
happened the other night?

01:08:02.146 --> 01:08:02.979
- No.

01:08:05.982 --> 01:08:07.951
- Ice cream at 7:30 in the
morning?

01:08:08.051 --> 01:08:10.086
- It's better than grilled
cheese, right?

01:08:12.222 --> 01:08:14.191
I spoke to Larry.

01:08:14.291 --> 01:08:15.992
- Of course you did.

01:08:16.092 --> 01:08:17.227
What'd he say?

01:08:17.327 --> 01:08:18.962
- He said a lot, son.

01:08:19.062 --> 01:08:20.664
Sounds like Larry.

01:08:20.764 --> 01:08:22.266
- JJ, sweetie,

01:08:22.366 --> 01:08:24.634
do you mind taking your ice
cream into the living room?

01:08:24.734 --> 01:08:25.969
You can play in there.

01:08:27.271 --> 01:08:28.705
- Okay, GMA.

01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:29.873
- Great.

01:08:29.973 --> 01:08:30.807
Thank you.

01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:40.850
What's going on with you?

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:48.692
- I don't wanna talk about it.

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:50.560
- I didn't raise you in
a good Christian home

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:53.763
for you to go out drinking
and starting fights.

01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:03.873
Go get changed, we're going to
church.

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:05.041
- I'm not going to church, mama.

01:09:05.141 --> 01:09:07.211
- Oh, you're going to church

01:09:07.311 --> 01:09:10.079
and we're gonna pick up my car
on the way.

01:09:42.379 --> 01:09:45.815
- Being a follower of Jesus
will cost you something.

01:09:47.451 --> 01:09:48.952
It may cost you friends,

01:09:51.255 --> 01:09:52.989
it may cost you your job,

01:09:53.089 --> 01:09:55.725
it may even cost you your life.

01:09:57.394 --> 01:10:01.465
But as the Apostle Paul
reminds us in Philippians 3:8,

01:10:01.565 --> 01:10:05.702
"Indeed I count everything a
loss

01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:10.307
for the surpassing work of
knowing Christ Jesus, my Lord."

01:10:12.676 --> 01:10:16.513
I want to sum up today's
sermon with a quote.

01:10:18.615 --> 01:10:20.183
Jesus asked his disciples,

01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:23.387
"What does it profit a man

01:10:24.854 --> 01:10:28.057
to gain the whole world
yet to lose his soul?

01:10:29.626 --> 01:10:33.530
And what will a man give
in exchange for his soul?"

01:10:41.838 --> 01:10:43.006
- Hey.

01:10:43.106 --> 01:10:43.907
- Yeah.

01:10:44.007 --> 01:10:44.908
- Meet me in the attic in 10
minutes.

01:10:45.008 --> 01:10:46.310
- What?

01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:47.311
No mama, I got something
I got to take care of.

01:10:47.411 --> 01:10:48.712
- 10 minutes.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.750
- Yes, ma'am.

01:11:24.748 --> 01:11:25.815
What's going on, mama?

01:11:28.885 --> 01:11:31.721
I want to show
you something, sit down.

01:11:35.392 --> 01:11:36.860
What are these?

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.862
- These are your dad's.

01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:42.799
He was one of the best bull
riders ever.

01:11:46.436 --> 01:11:49.606
I remember the day that he won
this one,

01:11:49.706 --> 01:11:51.240
National Finals Rodeo.

01:11:53.477 --> 01:11:57.447
He was larger than life that
day, still is, you know?

01:12:00.083 --> 01:12:05.154
Anyway, after your
brother was born, I had,

01:12:08.224 --> 01:12:09.893
I had complications

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:13.262
and I was told I could
never have another child

01:12:16.232 --> 01:12:17.834
and then I got pregnant with you

01:12:20.269 --> 01:12:24.340
and it was the happiest day
of my life, your dad's too.

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:28.678
Oh yeah.

01:12:28.778 --> 01:12:33.783
After I told him, his eyes
lit up like a Christmas tree.

01:12:37.487 --> 01:12:39.456
I'll never forget the look on
his face.

01:12:41.658 --> 01:12:43.059
You were our little miracle.

01:12:44.794 --> 01:12:47.230
He never attended
another rodeo after that,

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:51.601
never said why and I didn't ask,

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:54.738
but I knew.

01:12:59.008 --> 01:13:03.713
He gave up his dreams
to care for his family.

01:13:09.486 --> 01:13:10.887
He's a good man, Noah

01:13:15.492 --> 01:13:16.860
and he loves you very much.

01:13:20.764 --> 01:13:22.231
Losing your brother,

01:13:27.170 --> 01:13:28.972
it's been very hard on him.

01:13:31.441 --> 01:13:34.511
Yeah, he was something though,
right?

01:13:36.613 --> 01:13:37.781
Look at these.

01:15:26.389 --> 01:15:28.191
- I miss you, brother.

01:15:34.731 --> 01:15:36.633
I wish you could meet JJ.

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:44.608
He's amazing, you know, just
like you.

01:15:54.417 --> 01:15:55.251
I love you.

01:16:06.362 --> 01:16:09.733
Lord, please forgive my pride

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:13.637
and forgive me for

01:16:16.139 --> 01:16:18.574
leaving my family when
they needed me the most.

01:16:25.749 --> 01:16:27.684
Thank you.

01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:33.790
Thank you.

01:17:13.529 --> 01:17:14.563
Hey pop.

01:17:14.664 --> 01:17:17.834
- Son, grab a bail of
hay, give me some help.

01:17:20.269 --> 01:17:21.104
- No.

01:17:23.773 --> 01:17:24.607
- No?

01:17:26.710 --> 01:17:27.543
- I have a better idea.

01:17:38.621 --> 01:17:39.689
You remember how to do that?

01:17:39.789 --> 01:17:42.358
Oh, I think
I remember a thing or too.

01:17:42.458 --> 01:17:46.195
Dash, come on, come on.

01:17:46.295 --> 01:17:47.430
Come on, buddy.

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:48.798
This way, dad.

01:17:48.898 --> 01:17:49.999
That a boy.

01:17:59.475 --> 01:18:02.211
I remember the first time I
brought you and your brother

01:18:02.311 --> 01:18:03.279
to this spot.

01:18:06.049 --> 01:18:08.684
- Yeah, me too.

01:18:10.854 --> 01:18:11.788
- What was the name

01:18:11.888 --> 01:18:14.824
of that little dog that you used
to have?

01:18:14.924 --> 01:18:16.692
- Oh, Boot.

01:18:16.793 --> 01:18:17.861
- Boot.

01:18:17.961 --> 01:18:19.128
- Yeah.

01:18:19.228 --> 01:18:20.629
- I never could for the life of
me

01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:23.632
figure out why you named that
dog Boot.

01:18:23.733 --> 01:18:26.435
- Because he always liked
to sleep on my boot.

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:28.271
- That's right.

01:18:28.371 --> 01:18:29.873
He was a good one.

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:31.975
- Yeah.

01:18:33.009 --> 01:18:35.779
Yeah, he was, just like you,
dad.

01:18:41.785 --> 01:18:43.086
- What do you mean?

01:18:43.186 --> 01:18:45.454
- Mom showed me all the
belt buckles you won.

01:18:47.991 --> 01:18:51.928
- Man, I told your mother never
to tell you and your brother

01:18:52.028 --> 01:18:53.096
about them.
- Why?

01:18:54.197 --> 01:18:56.065
Why wouldn't you tell us that?

01:18:57.767 --> 01:18:59.735
You gave up your dream.

01:19:03.773 --> 01:19:07.076
- Having you boys, that was my
dream.

01:19:09.946 --> 01:19:11.815
And if I had kept living my
life the way I was doing it

01:19:11.915 --> 01:19:14.417
I wouldn't have been around
you or your mother so.

01:19:19.255 --> 01:19:20.656
- I'm sorry, dad.

01:19:23.326 --> 01:19:25.028
I'm sorry for the way that I
left.

01:19:28.631 --> 01:19:29.833
I just hope you can forgive me.

01:19:33.069 --> 01:19:36.472
- I'd forgive you, son, but
there isn't anything to forgive.

01:19:42.979 --> 01:19:43.913
- I love you, dad.

01:19:53.389 --> 01:19:54.490
- I love you too, son.

01:19:59.195 --> 01:20:00.029
Yeah.

01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:08.872
It's getting late, probably
should head back soon

01:20:08.972 --> 01:20:11.574
after I cast a few more.

01:20:16.079 --> 01:20:19.415
- Oh, that smells amazing, mama.

01:20:19.515 --> 01:20:21.217
I'm so hungry, gimme a little
bite.

01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:23.386
- Hey, you stop it.

01:20:25.021 --> 01:20:26.489
- Somebody coming to dinner?

01:20:26.589 --> 01:20:29.492
Well, why don't you
answer the door and find out?

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:36.165
- Who's coming to dinner, JJ?

01:20:41.938 --> 01:20:45.208
LeeAnn, hey, what's going on?

01:20:45.308 --> 01:20:46.242
- Hey Noah.

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:49.478
- Oh, hey, what are you?

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:51.147
- Your mom invited me

01:20:51.247 --> 01:20:52.949
and besides, I wanted to see JJ.

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:56.319
- Oh, um-

01:20:56.419 --> 01:20:58.354
- Well don't just stand there,
let her in.

01:20:59.655 --> 01:21:00.957
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, come on
in.

01:21:01.057 --> 01:21:02.091
It's good to see you.

01:21:03.026 --> 01:21:03.927
- Hi.

01:21:04.027 --> 01:21:04.928
- Hey.

01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:07.630
Um, how you been?

01:21:08.597 --> 01:21:09.798
- Good.

01:21:09.899 --> 01:21:12.101
You said that you would
come.

01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:13.970
- I told you I would.

01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:15.538
- Yeah, he missed you.

01:21:15.638 --> 01:21:16.906
- I missed him.

01:21:17.773 --> 01:21:20.309
- It's so nice to meet you,
LeeAnn.

01:21:20.409 --> 01:21:21.410
- Nice meeting you, Mrs. Bryan.

01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:23.479
- Noah, you didn't tell
me how pretty she is.

01:21:24.413 --> 01:21:25.148
- You didn't tell me
she was coming to dinner

01:21:25.248 --> 01:21:26.349
so we're even, mama.

01:21:26.449 --> 01:21:29.252
Does anybody want a
chicken leg?

01:21:29.352 --> 01:21:31.720
- I think I'm good.
- I got mine but hey, son,

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:32.555
can I have a roll, please?

01:21:32.655 --> 01:21:33.822
Yeah, dad.

01:21:33.923 --> 01:21:36.392
- Yeah, let me trade you some
potatoes for that, please,

01:21:36.492 --> 01:21:38.327
sir, thank you.

01:21:38.427 --> 01:21:39.162
Appreciate it.

01:21:39.262 --> 01:21:40.263
- You better hand me the butter

01:21:40.363 --> 01:21:42.331
'cause I know he's gonna want
that next.

01:21:42.431 --> 01:21:43.732
- Yes, indeed, yes, indeed.

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:44.968
- Man, this is a lot.

01:21:45.068 --> 01:21:47.270
- LeeAnn, so glad you
could be here with us.

01:21:47.370 --> 01:21:48.404
- I'm so happy to be here.

01:21:48.504 --> 01:21:50.940
- JJ, what'd you do today on the
farm?

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:55.378
- We feeded the cows and
the chickens and the horses.

01:21:55.478 --> 01:21:56.612
Oh that's great, JJ.

01:21:56.712 --> 01:21:58.681
- That's right, what'd you do
with GMA?

01:21:58.781 --> 01:22:00.849
- We went into the garden

01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:03.886
and we picked all different
types of vegetables.

01:22:03.987 --> 01:22:05.154
- Yes, we did.

01:22:05.254 --> 01:22:06.990
- You glad to see Miss LeeAnn,
buddy?

01:22:07.090 --> 01:22:08.524
Yeah.

01:22:08.624 --> 01:22:09.492
- Me too.

01:22:09.592 --> 01:22:11.527
This is a really beautiful
place.

01:22:11.627 --> 01:22:14.363
- Been in the family
for three generations?

01:22:15.231 --> 01:22:18.234
- Yeah, what was it, our
great, great grandfather

01:22:18.334 --> 01:22:19.168
won it in a poker game?

01:22:19.268 --> 01:22:20.303
- No, really?

01:22:20.403 --> 01:22:22.371
- He is just pulling your leg.

01:22:22.471 --> 01:22:23.206
- I'm not.

01:22:23.306 --> 01:22:24.140
Mama.

01:22:25.308 --> 01:22:26.742
- Well, it's very peaceful out
here.

01:22:26.842 --> 01:22:28.577
- Well you are welcome here
anytime,

01:22:28.677 --> 01:22:29.878
I want you to know that.

01:22:36.485 --> 01:22:37.720
- I gotta go pee.

01:22:48.064 --> 01:22:50.133
- So you gonna tell me
what really happened?

01:22:52.401 --> 01:22:56.872
- Well I work at an animal
shelter on the weekends

01:22:56.972 --> 01:22:58.641
and I was helping a dog,

01:23:00.409 --> 01:23:05.481
no, I got in a bar fight and
it was not my best moment.

01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:13.456
- What an amazing place to grow
up in.

01:23:14.357 --> 01:23:17.626
- Yeah, yeah, it really is.

01:23:18.594 --> 01:23:20.296
It's funny, I hated it growing
up.

01:23:21.130 --> 01:23:21.964
- Why?

01:23:24.067 --> 01:23:26.135
- I don't know, I mean I
had to be up every morning

01:23:26.235 --> 01:23:28.637
at 4:00 AM to feed the
chickens and the horses.

01:23:30.406 --> 01:23:31.974
As a kid, that ain't no fun.

01:23:33.276 --> 01:23:37.580
- Yeah, well beats growing
up in a two bedroom apartment

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:39.448
and sharing a room with my
sister.

01:23:41.917 --> 01:23:44.887
- Grass is always greener, I
suppose.

01:23:44.987 --> 01:23:45.954
- Yeah, I guess so.

01:23:48.491 --> 01:23:50.459
- He needs a good girl in his
life.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.896
- Don't go butting into this.

01:23:53.996 --> 01:23:55.598
- Oh I would never.

01:24:00.069 --> 01:24:01.304
- It's a beautiful night.

01:24:02.405 --> 01:24:03.372
- Yes, it is.

01:24:08.177 --> 01:24:10.246
- Is he going to kiss her or
what?

01:24:10.346 --> 01:24:11.514
- Now who's butting in?

01:24:19.322 --> 01:24:23.559
- I had a great time tonight
but I better be going.

01:24:23.659 --> 01:24:25.094
- Do you have to?

01:24:34.837 --> 01:24:36.339
- It was great meeting your
parents.

01:24:36.439 --> 01:24:37.440
They're good people.

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:40.876
- Well I would say you
made quite the impression.

01:24:40.976 --> 01:24:41.944
- Oh really?

01:24:50.119 --> 01:24:53.289
Well maybe we can, I don't know-

01:24:53.389 --> 01:24:55.891
- Yeah, mmhmm, I'd like that.

01:24:58.327 --> 01:24:59.162
- Great.

01:25:03.899 --> 01:25:05.534
- Let me get that for you.

01:25:05.634 --> 01:25:07.203
- Oh well I guess chivalry isn't
dead.

01:25:07.303 --> 01:25:09.004
- Well my mama is watching.

01:25:10.173 --> 01:25:11.574
I'm just kidding.

01:25:13.008 --> 01:25:14.042
You sure I can't drive you home?

01:25:14.143 --> 01:25:15.110
- I'm sure.

01:25:15.211 --> 01:25:17.980
It's not that long of
a drive but thank you.

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:18.914
- Alright.

01:25:19.915 --> 01:25:21.417
JJ was real happy to see you.

01:25:26.622 --> 01:25:27.456
I was too.

01:25:29.158 --> 01:25:34.163
- Yeah, me too.

01:25:35.498 --> 01:25:37.500
Well I better be going.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:38.434
- All right.

01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:08.597
Dash, Dash!

01:26:11.767 --> 01:26:12.601
Come here.

01:26:13.469 --> 01:26:15.037
Good boy, good boy.

01:26:19.442 --> 01:26:20.943
Let me show you how it's done.

01:26:34.423 --> 01:26:35.391
I've been thinking.

01:26:36.459 --> 01:26:37.293
- About what?

01:26:40.463 --> 01:26:41.297
- I was thinking maybe JJ and
I could live here full time.

01:26:47.970 --> 01:26:48.804
- Maybe.

01:26:50.406 --> 01:26:53.442
- I was thinking I could
help out on the farm,

01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:54.377
JJ could learn.

01:26:59.515 --> 01:27:00.349
- Try this.

01:27:08.691 --> 01:27:09.525
- Okay then.

01:27:11.226 --> 01:27:12.160
- Okay then.

01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:18.467
- Smells like rain.

01:27:18.567 --> 01:27:21.036
- Yes, sir, it sure does.

01:27:26.108 --> 01:27:27.910
- He's ready to see you now. Mr.
Walker.

01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:28.844
- Thank you.

01:27:37.853 --> 01:27:39.455
Thanks a lot, Colt.

01:27:39.555 --> 01:27:41.357
- Yeah, I haven't said yes just
yet.

01:27:43.191 --> 01:27:44.026
- What's that?

01:27:44.126 --> 01:27:45.628
- Just watch.

01:27:58.173 --> 01:28:00.943
Kid's got a good right
hook, I'll give him that.

01:28:01.043 --> 01:28:01.977
- He's sober now.

01:28:03.145 --> 01:28:04.046
- Right.

01:28:04.146 --> 01:28:06.382
Listen, I was wild in my youth,

01:28:06.482 --> 01:28:07.783
you were wild in your youth,

01:28:07.883 --> 01:28:09.518
but the industry's changed.

01:28:09.618 --> 01:28:10.919
So have I.

01:28:11.019 --> 01:28:12.187
This?

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:13.789
- Hey, what can I say, Cole?

01:28:13.889 --> 01:28:16.692
The kids got something,
you told me that yourself.

01:28:16.792 --> 01:28:19.928
- Yes, but this image is
not what my fans expect.

01:28:21.497 --> 01:28:25.701
- Okay man, I get it but the
kid deserves a second chance.

01:28:27.069 --> 01:28:28.637
God knows we got ours.

01:28:32.908 --> 01:28:33.742
- Oh man.

01:28:36.545 --> 01:28:38.381
I think your pie might
be better than my mama's.

01:28:38.481 --> 01:28:39.548
- Oh.

01:28:39.648 --> 01:28:41.283
- Don't you tell her I said
that.

01:28:42.184 --> 01:28:43.386
- I still can't believe
a country boy like you

01:28:43.486 --> 01:28:45.454
has never been on a picnic.

01:28:47.356 --> 01:28:49.392
- I was always too busy working
the farm.

01:28:49.492 --> 01:28:50.459
Can't believe a city girl like
you

01:28:50.559 --> 01:28:51.894
can ride a horse that good.

01:28:51.994 --> 01:28:54.096
- I had riding lessons when I
was younger.

01:28:56.732 --> 01:28:58.934
I'm glad you and JJ
are getting along here.

01:28:59.034 --> 01:29:02.405
- Being back here, I can see the
beauty

01:29:02.505 --> 01:29:04.272
in growing up in a place like
this.

01:29:06.509 --> 01:29:07.710
- I'm very glad to hear that.

01:29:10.413 --> 01:29:12.247
- You know I was, I was
thinking,

01:29:13.816 --> 01:29:16.284
it's been so nice getting to
know you.

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:20.389
I don't know I mean I was
thinking maybe

01:29:20.489 --> 01:29:23.592
- Yes, I would love to.

01:29:23.692 --> 01:29:25.160
- You don't even know
what I was gonna say.

01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:27.262
- I would love to spend more
time with you, Noah Bryan.

01:29:30.265 --> 01:29:32.300
- What?

01:29:32.401 --> 01:29:34.136
- You are so beautiful.

01:29:35.438 --> 01:29:37.339
- Is that some country charm?

01:29:49.985 --> 01:29:54.156
- I guess we better get
back, getting feeding time.

01:29:54.256 --> 01:29:55.524
- I'll race ya.

01:29:55.624 --> 01:29:56.925
- Loser feeds the animals?

01:30:47.175 --> 01:30:48.544
- Hey.

01:30:48.644 --> 01:30:49.845
- Hey.

01:30:49.945 --> 01:30:52.981
Hey, what do you think about
getting another horse for JJ?

01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:56.351
I want him to learn to ride.

01:30:58.821 --> 01:30:59.788
- I think so.

01:31:01.389 --> 01:31:02.390
- All right.

01:31:03.826 --> 01:31:06.061
- Son, come here a second.

01:31:09.264 --> 01:31:10.766
- What's going on?

01:31:11.867 --> 01:31:12.901
- Your mama and me,

01:31:14.102 --> 01:31:17.540
we've been wanting to give
you something for a long time.

01:31:19.341 --> 01:31:20.609
- No.

01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:21.443
Go ahead.

01:31:21.544 --> 01:31:22.444
- No dad, I can't.

01:31:22.545 --> 01:31:24.412
- Son, go ahead, open it.

01:31:35.991 --> 01:31:37.392
You got a real talent.

01:31:37.492 --> 01:31:38.727
We've always known it.

01:31:40.929 --> 01:31:43.766
I guess,

01:31:43.866 --> 01:31:45.934
I guess I just didn't wanna lose
you too.

01:31:52.875 --> 01:31:54.042
- Thanks, dad.

01:31:55.177 --> 01:31:57.746
- Now, you go out and shoe 'em.

01:33:01.677 --> 01:33:04.246
It looks comfy.

01:33:04.346 --> 01:33:07.349
- I am so glad that you
found a place nearby.

01:33:07.449 --> 01:33:10.052
- Me too and I'm transferring
to the office in Fayetteville.

01:33:10.152 --> 01:33:14.857
- And I am glad too so you
can look after this one.

01:33:14.957 --> 01:33:16.258
- I intend to.

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:24.332
- Larry?

01:33:24.432 --> 01:33:25.367
Hey kid.

01:33:25.467 --> 01:33:27.302
- Hey, hey, what's up, man?

01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:29.938
I got some good news.

01:33:30.038 --> 01:33:30.873
You got a minute?

01:33:40.115 --> 01:33:42.217
What you think, Dash?

01:33:42.317 --> 01:33:43.218
Waiting on you, bud,

01:33:43.318 --> 01:33:45.320
waiting on you to come up with
the line.

01:33:46.855 --> 01:33:50.058
Here we go, it's the one, be the
one.

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:56.231
* Stepping in when the
pressure's on *

01:33:56.331 --> 01:34:00.602
* Crying tears with the lights
on *

01:34:00.703 --> 01:34:03.071
Would you say with the lights
on?

01:34:03.171 --> 01:34:05.173
Let's try off, then we'll go
back to on.

01:34:05.273 --> 01:34:07.009
I'm saying off, you're saying
on.

01:34:08.576 --> 01:34:09.477
Oh yeah.

01:34:09.577 --> 01:34:14.349
* Stepping in when the
pressure's on *

01:34:14.449 --> 01:34:15.984
- Hello cowboy, what you got?

01:34:16.084 --> 01:34:17.219
- Tony's.

01:34:17.319 --> 01:34:18.153
- Ah.

01:34:19.121 --> 01:34:20.655
Baby, have you seen Noah?

01:34:20.756 --> 01:34:22.024
- He's not out there with you?

01:34:22.124 --> 01:34:24.760
- No and all his chores are
done,

01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:26.561
he's been a big help.

01:34:26.661 --> 01:34:29.397
- And he's been a great
daddy to JJ, right?

01:34:29.497 --> 01:34:32.267
- And he's been a great daddy to
JJ.

01:34:33.168 --> 01:34:34.502
He's being the man.

01:34:35.537 --> 01:34:37.005
- Oh you noticed.

01:34:38.606 --> 01:34:40.743
- Hey, I'm proud of him.

01:34:40.843 --> 01:34:42.277
- Me too.

01:34:42.377 --> 01:34:44.913
- Speaking of which, do
you know where daddy is?

01:34:45.013 --> 01:34:46.548
- He's at the porch.

01:34:46.648 --> 01:34:47.916
- Do you mind going out
there and telling him

01:34:48.016 --> 01:34:49.852
that breakfast is ready?

01:34:49.952 --> 01:34:50.685
- Yes, GMA.

01:34:50.786 --> 01:34:51.787
- Do it quick, quick, quick.

01:34:55.157 --> 01:34:56.524
Hey, those are JJ's.

01:34:57.860 --> 01:34:59.661
You get the big ones.

01:34:59.762 --> 01:35:01.029
Just go sit at the table.

01:35:02.931 --> 01:35:05.768
- Daddy, breakfast is ready.

01:35:05.868 --> 01:35:08.303
- All right buddy, I'll
be in there in a second.

01:35:08.403 --> 01:35:09.471
Hey, come here.

01:35:09.571 --> 01:35:12.074
I need your help 'cause Dash
ain't doing much for me.

01:35:12.174 --> 01:35:13.141
No offense.

01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:16.344
- Daddy.

01:35:16.444 --> 01:35:17.179
- What's that?

01:35:17.279 --> 01:35:19.848
- What does being the man mean?

01:35:21.917 --> 01:35:24.319
- Being the man, being the man.

01:35:24.419 --> 01:35:25.587
I love you, JJ.

01:35:25.687 --> 01:35:28.857
Oh my God, that's it, being the
man.

01:35:30.692 --> 01:35:33.829
Want to know what being the man
means?

01:35:33.929 --> 01:35:38.901
* Being the man is telling the
world that you got it wrong *

01:35:40.568 --> 01:35:43.371
* Being the man

01:35:43.471 --> 01:35:47.375
* Ain't running away, it's
running home *

01:35:47.475 --> 01:35:50.913
* Stepping in when the
pressure's on *

01:35:51.013 --> 01:35:54.116
* Crying tears with the lights
on *

01:35:54.216 --> 01:35:55.617
* Being the man

01:35:55.717 --> 01:35:57.419
There it is, yeah.

01:35:57.519 --> 01:36:02.524
* Being the man

01:36:07.195 --> 01:36:09.998
* Well, I missed your birthdays
*

01:36:10.098 --> 01:36:13.768
* Candles on the cake

01:36:13.869 --> 01:36:18.874
* I hope you didn't
waste your wish on me *

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:22.644
* Well I missed a lot of things
*

01:36:22.744 --> 01:36:25.613
* For that, I'll take the blame
*

01:36:25.713 --> 01:36:28.650
* And I'll spend the rest of my
days *

01:36:28.750 --> 01:36:31.086
* Making it up to you

01:36:31.186 --> 01:36:34.990
* 'Cause sometimes being a man

01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:38.193

that you got it wrong *

* Being the man

01:36:57.846 --> 01:37:00.748
* I'm gonna try to be

01:37:00.849 --> 01:37:03.351
* The kind of man you see in me
*

01:37:03.451 --> 01:37:06.588
* 'Cause I don't want to repeat
*

01:37:06.688 --> 01:37:09.457

* Means telling the world
that you got it wrong *

01:37:56.238 --> 01:37:58.907
* Being the man

01:37:59.007 --> 01:38:02.477
* Ain't running away, it's
running home *

01:38:02.577 --> 01:38:05.180
* Being the man

01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:08.951
* Is telling the world
that you got it wrong *

01:38:09.051 --> 01:38:11.719
* Being the man

01:38:11.819 --> 01:38:15.657
* Ain't running away, it's
running home *

01:38:15.757 --> 01:38:18.826
* Stepping in when the
pressure's on *

01:38:18.927 --> 01:38:21.596
* Crying tears with the lights
on *

01:38:21.696 --> 01:38:24.832
* Being the man

01:38:24.933 --> 01:38:27.569
* Being the man

01:38:27.669 --> 01:38:31.173
* Oh, being the man

01:38:31.273 --> 01:38:34.242
* Being the man

01:38:34.342 --> 01:38:37.279
- Thanks for giving him
a second chance, man.

01:38:37.379 --> 01:38:41.383
- Everybody deserves a
second chance, everybody.

01:39:11.879 --> 01:39:14.016
* You can use it

01:39:14.116 --> 01:39:15.517
* You can spend it

01:39:15.617 --> 01:39:17.219
* You can waste it

01:39:17.319 --> 01:39:18.987
* But why would you want to

01:39:19.087 --> 01:39:21.789
* Each second, every minute

01:39:21.889 --> 01:39:25.493
* Is a memory that you get to
hold onto *

01:39:25.593 --> 01:39:29.564
* And I don't want to regret
this life *

01:39:29.664 --> 01:39:33.535
* I want to spend the rest of my
time *

01:39:33.635 --> 01:39:38.106
* Being next to you

01:39:38.206 --> 01:39:43.211
* Can we stay right here forever
*

01:39:44.779 --> 01:39:47.549
* Stay right here

01:39:47.649 --> 01:39:50.985
* Nothing better than what's
right in front of me *

01:39:51.086 --> 01:39:54.089
* I've got four wheels on the
ground *

01:39:54.189 --> 01:39:57.059
* I think I'm ready to slow it
down *

01:39:57.159 --> 01:40:02.164
* And just stay right here

01:40:06.134 --> 01:40:08.070
* You can't buy it

01:40:08.170 --> 01:40:09.771
* Can't rewind it

01:40:09.871 --> 01:40:12.907
* Can't bottle it up
and save it for later *

01:40:13.007 --> 01:40:16.444
* It won't go to plan though

01:40:16.544 --> 01:40:19.514
* Life's for living
can't put it on paper *

01:40:19.614 --> 01:40:23.585
* And I don't want to regret
this life *

01:40:23.685 --> 01:40:27.955
* I want to spend the rest of my
time *

01:40:28.056 --> 01:40:31.859
* Being next to you

01:40:31.959 --> 01:40:36.964
* Can we stay right here forever
*

01:40:38.766 --> 01:40:41.336
* Stay right here

01:40:41.436 --> 01:40:45.006
* Nothing better than what's
right in front of me *

01:40:45.107 --> 01:40:47.809
* I've got four wheels on the
ground *

01:40:47.909 --> 01:40:51.045
* I think I'm ready to slow it
down *

01:40:51.146 --> 01:40:56.151
* And just stay right here

01:40:57.352 --> 01:41:02.357
* Can we stay right here

01:41:06.928 --> 01:41:10.565
* Right here

01:41:10.665 --> 01:41:13.768
* Right here

01:41:13.868 --> 01:41:18.873
* I don't want to regret this
life *

01:41:19.541 --> 01:41:24.546
* I want to spend the rest of my
time *

01:41:26.281 --> 01:41:31.286
* With you right here forever

01:41:32.487 --> 01:41:35.590
* Can we stay right here

01:41:35.690 --> 01:41:39.060
* Nothing better than what's
right in front of me *

01:41:39.161 --> 01:41:41.963
* I've got four wheels on the
ground *

01:41:42.063 --> 01:41:45.099
* Think I'm ready to slow it
down *

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:45.933
* I'm ready now

01:41:46.033 --> 01:41:51.038
* Can we stay right here

01:41:52.106 --> 01:41:54.942
* Stay right here

01:42:25.673 --> 01:42:30.645
* If I had a dime for every time
*

01:42:31.746 --> 01:42:36.751
* That I worried time away

01:42:38.353 --> 01:42:43.358
* I'd be the richest man you
could find *

01:42:44.659 --> 01:42:49.664
* But I wouldn't be happy

01:42:51.266 --> 01:42:56.271
* I'm always spinning my wheels
*

01:42:57.239 --> 01:43:02.244
* I just need to be right here

01:43:04.145 --> 01:43:06.914
* And try to not blink

01:43:07.014 --> 01:43:07.749
* 'Cause you're mine

01:43:07.849 --> 01:43:09.717
* Miss anything

01:43:09.817 --> 01:43:11.018
* One more time

01:43:11.118 --> 01:43:14.155
* Don't let your head
go before your heart *

01:43:14.256 --> 01:43:17.225
* Wherever you go, there you are
*

01:43:17.325 --> 01:43:19.661
* Soak it all up

01:43:19.761 --> 01:43:22.597
* While you got breath in your
lungs *

01:43:22.697 --> 01:43:24.031
* Live it up

01:43:24.131 --> 01:43:27.001
* Don't let your head
go before your heart *

01:43:27.101 --> 01:43:32.073
* Wherever you go, there you are
*

01:43:36.210 --> 01:43:38.746
* I met a guy

01:43:38.846 --> 01:43:42.417
* He was 89

01:43:42.517 --> 01:43:47.522
* He gave me life advice

01:43:48.756 --> 01:43:53.761
* He said, don't get ahead of
God *

01:43:55.730 --> 01:44:00.735
* He will guide your steps

01:44:01.536 --> 01:44:06.608
* I'm always spinning my wheels
*

01:44:07.675 --> 01:44:12.680
* I just need a be right here

01:44:14.949 --> 01:44:17.852
* And try to not blink
'cause you're mine *

01:44:17.952 --> 01:44:21.423
* Miss any day one more time

01:44:21.523 --> 01:44:24.592
* Don't let your head
go before your heart *

01:44:24.692 --> 01:44:27.662
* Wherever you go, there you are
*

01:44:27.762 --> 01:44:29.797
* Soak it all up

01:44:29.897 --> 01:44:32.967
* While you got breath in your
lungs *

01:44:33.067 --> 01:44:34.068
* Live it up

01:44:34.168 --> 01:44:37.339
* Don't let your head
go before your heart *

01:44:37.439 --> 01:44:42.444
* Wherever you go, there you are
*

01:44:44.011 --> 01:44:47.882
* Wherever you go, there you are
*
