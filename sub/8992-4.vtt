00:01.835 --> 00:03.420
24 hours of detox

00:03.420 --> 00:06.298
and 90 days
at a sober living facility,
effective immediately.

00:06.298 --> 00:08.008
I'm sorry, guys,
I just don't belong here.

00:08.008 --> 00:10.302
No one thinks
they belong here, at first.

00:10.302 --> 00:11.803
Welcome to the fun house.

00:11.803 --> 00:14.514
No one can find out
that I'm in this place.

00:14.514 --> 00:17.142
Hey, babe.
Why did you come to school
with the guidance counselor?

00:17.142 --> 00:19.102
‐What is that?
‐Since when do you care?

00:19.102 --> 00:21.396
I've seen you lick coke
of the ladies' room floor.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.857
We can hang at my place.
Come on.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.859
‐I can't.
‐Why?

00:27.861 --> 00:29.529
‐Who was he?
‐Nobody.

00:29.529 --> 00:32.866
‐We are not old.
‐We used to go to raves
in the '90s,

00:32.866 --> 00:36.036
and now we're
picking out which font is better
for your wedding invitation.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.248
You're potentially putting
your sobriety at risk,
as well as Maddie's.

00:39.248 --> 00:42.417
<i>So, you and Maddie</i>
<i>can't happen. We clear?</i>

00:43.418 --> 00:44.628
Good night, Maddie.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.257
Man on TV:
<i>Oh, this is</i>
<i>absolutely fantastic.</i>

00:48.257 --> 00:50.592
<i>It hearkens back</i>

00:50.592 --> 00:54.096

‐(chuckles)

00:54.096 --> 00:56.014

00:58.517 --> 01:00.686
Maddie: <i>You know</i>

01:00.686 --> 01:03.772

<i>weird things about sobriety?</i>

01:06.358 --> 01:08.694
‐(TV turns off)
<i>‐Figuring out who</i>

01:10.195 --> 01:12.990
Oh my God!
(laughs)

01:12.990 --> 01:16.743
‐What are you doing here?
‐I was in town, missing you.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.620
Three years
and you just now miss me?

01:18.620 --> 01:20.956
Maddie:
<i>You wouldn't think whether</i>
<i>your friends like to party</i>

01:20.956 --> 01:22.207
<i>would be such a huge deal</i>

01:22.207 --> 01:24.001
<i>in your relationship,</i>
<i>but it is.</i>

01:25.752 --> 01:29.006
‐How have you been?
‐(speaking manically)
I've been great!

01:29.006 --> 01:31.091
I mean,
I just started
this new job,

01:31.091 --> 01:33.885
but there's this woman‐‐
oh my God, you would
just totally die

01:33.885 --> 01:35.304
if you had
to hear her voice.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.514
I've really been thinking
that I should just start
my own business,

01:37.514 --> 01:39.308
because I have
so many original ideas,

01:39.308 --> 01:42.269
like a microwave that starts
when you whistle, so you don't
have to get up off the couch.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.229
I don't know.
I just wanna go to Hawaii.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.273
Remember when we used
to talk about going there
all the time?

01:46.273 --> 01:48.066
I just keep picturing myself
on the beach in the sand

01:48.066 --> 01:49.943
with a drink, a ukulele,
a coconut, and naked man.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.404
But‐‐ so,
what's going on with you?

01:52.404 --> 01:55.198
Wait. Before you tell me,
you're never gonna believe
who I ran into.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.408
I heard about Rob.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.287
(nervous chuckle)

02:00.287 --> 02:01.913
Yeah. (sighs)

02:01.913 --> 02:04.124
I kept trying to tell him
that he was gonna...

02:04.124 --> 02:06.084
that he should stop

02:06.084 --> 02:07.794
or at least slow down.

02:09.171 --> 02:10.672
(chuckles)

02:10.672 --> 02:12.633
Why‐‐ why are you here?

02:22.476 --> 02:24.936
I'm here to try
to get you to stop.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.982
I think you should leave.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.818
I think I should stay.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.781
Here is a list of students
who got in early admission.

02:35.781 --> 02:38.200
This is a list of kids
taking a gap year,

02:38.200 --> 02:41.495
and these are the kids
who we pray crawl out of here

02:41.495 --> 02:43.413
with a diploma
between their teeth.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.749
We'll send them
to job fairs, counseling.

02:45.749 --> 02:48.210
You can't save
all the stray dogs, Cynthia.

02:48.210 --> 02:50.712
What kind of thing is that
for a headmaster to say?

02:50.712 --> 02:54.800
We are an elite institution.
Our job is to educate the kids
who want to be educated.

02:54.800 --> 02:58.303
And you can't do that well
when you focus on the screw‐ups.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.641
But I do love
how compassionate you are.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.351
It's definitely one
of your best qualities.

03:05.977 --> 03:08.021
Hey, while I've got you here,

03:08.021 --> 03:09.773
this is a list
of wedding venues.
We really‐‐

03:09.773 --> 03:11.441
Uh, uh, uh. You know the rules.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.568
Business only till four o'clock.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.862
I am very well aware
of the rules.

03:15.862 --> 03:19.950
And even though I find them
deeply annoying at times,

03:19.950 --> 03:23.995
I confess that strong boundaries
are one of your best qualities.

03:23.995 --> 03:26.706
‐What would you say
is the very best?
‐Uh, uh, uh.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.876
Business only
until four o'clock, Headmaster.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.133
(sighs)

03:36.133 --> 03:39.428
Craig:
So, before we conclude‐‐
an announcement.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.513
One of our fellow sober houses

03:41.513 --> 03:43.723
in Los Angeles is
in a bit of a bind,

03:43.723 --> 03:47.853
and they need
to tent for something‐‐
termites, I believe‐‐

03:47.853 --> 03:50.647
and they need a place
to stay for the weekend.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.732
I don't like
where this is going.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.026
We are heaving
with drunks already, Craig.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.236
Where are we gonna
put these people?

03:56.236 --> 03:58.488
On cots in our rooms.
It'll be fun.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.907
The more the merrier.
That's what I always say.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.076
It's just‐‐ it's just
for a couple of days,

04:03.076 --> 04:05.078
and these people
really need our help.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.748
Okay? Let's all find some‐‐
some charity

04:08.748 --> 04:11.126
in our hearts
for our fellow addicts.

04:11.126 --> 04:14.713
‐Destinations Malibu is a very‐‐
‐Destinations Malibu?

04:14.713 --> 04:17.007
As in "$80,000 a month

04:17.007 --> 04:19.885
and can afford more"
Destinations Malibu?

04:19.885 --> 04:23.138
Right. Well, good,
that's decided then.

04:23.138 --> 04:27.976
All right, we have
time for one final share,
and, Maddie, you're up.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.147
Sure. Whatever.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.193
‐Hi, I'm Maddie.
‐All: Hi, Maddie.

04:38.737 --> 04:41.114
You guys know
I'm the only person
in high school here.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.659
It's really been hard.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.914
I know I don't have a job
like most of you guys

04:48.914 --> 04:50.791
or obligations like kids,

04:50.791 --> 04:54.252
but I do have a group
of friends who have sustained me
through some pretty tough times.

04:57.506 --> 05:00.091
Ones I'm usually
in contact with 24/7...

05:01.092 --> 05:03.929
and who I'm now
totally cut off from.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.265
Those guys are my life.

05:10.227 --> 05:13.146
I feel totally cut off
from my life,

05:13.146 --> 05:16.358
and it doesn't feel good.
That's all.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.823
That‐‐ that's good.

05:22.823 --> 05:27.327
Maddie, that's really,
really good.

05:27.327 --> 05:32.958
I know many here
can identify with the isolation
that comes with early sobriety.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.423
Good. Right.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.301
Well, have a great day, people.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.970
‐Keep...
‐All: Coming back.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.721
‐Craig: Yes.
‐Oh, I'll be here.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.723
Maddie,
do you have a minute?

05:49.724 --> 05:51.268
Yeah.

05:51.268 --> 05:54.145
That was a really big deal.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.731
You just shared honestly
with your peers
for the first time.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.733
‐You're letting people in.
‐(chuckles)

05:59.734 --> 06:02.863
To that end, I have decided

06:02.863 --> 06:07.576
that it is time
to give you back... this.

06:07.576 --> 06:12.205
‐Oh my God. Seriously?
‐Yes. Yes.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.333
Seriously. Privileges here
come with improvement,

06:15.333 --> 06:17.043
and I saw real improvement
out there today.

06:18.795 --> 06:19.796
Hey.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.883
‐Good work, Maddie.
‐Thank you.

Whoa! Whoa.

‐What's the matter?
‐I'm a terrible human being.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.997
I'm selfish.
I'm narcissistic.

06:53.997 --> 06:57.125
‐Well, that's practically
a definition of an addict.
‐I'm not an addict!

06:57.125 --> 06:59.878
But I do happen
to be the worst girlfriend
in the world!

06:59.878 --> 07:02.547

No. With the exception
of Molly Ringwald,

ever been without my phone.

08:31.553 --> 08:33.513

I just wanna take
naked selfies and send them

just because I can.

08:37.809 --> 08:38.852
Well, that's a good way

08:38.852 --> 08:40.687
to get back in everyone's
good graces.

Oh. Your benevolence

08:53.199 --> 08:54.617
You're gonna have
to work a little harder,

08:54.617 --> 08:55.869
because he thinks you forgot.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.580
Oh, it's a all part

not in our
Egyptian cotton sheets

10:20.829 --> 10:23.248
and organic
down comforters, right?

10:23.248 --> 10:26.459
Which we had to burn
because of the bedbugs!

10:26.459 --> 10:28.002
I could sue you, you know.

10:31.923 --> 10:35.552
You said termites!
They had to leave their house
because of bedbugs!

10:35.552 --> 10:37.178
‐Whoa! Shh, shh, shh.
‐What?

10:37.178 --> 10:39.806
There is no way that
we can let them stay here.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.767
Yes, there is, okay?
They've all been cleared
of the vermin,

10:42.767 --> 10:46.604
and they're each paying
$5,000 to be here for two days.

10:46.604 --> 10:49.649
All we have to do is keep
the little bedbug issue a secret

10:49.649 --> 10:52.110
and that's $25,000‐‐
enough to fix our roof.

10:52.110 --> 10:55.029
Is that "charity in our hearts
for our fellow addicts," Craig?

10:55.029 --> 10:59.159
It's charity
for our addicts, okay?
We need to fix the roof.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.953
‐No way. It's disgusting.
‐Fine. Fine. Okay.

11:01.953 --> 11:03.913
Okay, none of them
stay in your room.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.833
And‐‐ and you get
the first single room

11:06.833 --> 11:08.209
that opens up
with the next discharge.

11:08.209 --> 11:11.212
Before Vern?
He'll go ballistic.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.464
Yes. Yes. Before Vern.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.802
‐Deal.
‐No one else
can know about this, okay?

11:17.802 --> 11:21.306
Or we're gonna lose the cash.
This is our little secret.

11:21.306 --> 11:22.891
All right?

11:22.891 --> 11:24.017
All right.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.189
(sighs)

11:32.275 --> 11:33.860
I can't believe
I haven't even seen you since‐‐

11:33.860 --> 11:35.904
You put me
in an institution?

11:35.904 --> 11:38.531
Maddie, you know I hate it
as much as you do.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.408
We're doing this for you.

11:40.408 --> 11:43.494
You have no idea
how much I've missed you.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.915
I miss you too.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.541
I really do.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.587
So, you got your phone back.
That's good, right?

11:52.587 --> 11:54.631
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐I'm gonna ask Craig

11:54.631 --> 11:57.842
if it's okay if I start
taking you out for...

11:57.842 --> 11:59.636
more than a couple of hours.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.846
We can‐‐
I'll take time off of work.

12:01.846 --> 12:04.933
We can go have lunch.
We can go do that Korean spa.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.309
Oh. Can we do a regular spa?

12:06.309 --> 12:09.020
I've had enough
of communal nudity
to last me a while.

12:09.020 --> 12:12.440
(laughs) You're the one
who always complained
about being an only child.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.026
I never pictured middle‐aged
addicts as siblings.

12:15.026 --> 12:16.444
Is it that bad?

12:17.737 --> 12:20.406
I can't believe
I'm saying this, but no.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.244
Everyone's really nice.

12:24.244 --> 12:28.122
I'm... getting used to it,
which is good,

12:28.122 --> 12:30.667
seeing as though
I'm not gonna have
any friends any time soon.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.545
Look. What's‐‐
what's going on?

12:34.545 --> 12:37.715
It's Zack's
18th birthday coming up...

12:38.716 --> 12:42.136
which is obviously
a huge deal, and...

12:43.388 --> 12:46.557
he and Ellie have planned
something without me.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.559
Of course
I won't be able to go.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.689
I just feel so cut off
from everyone.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.482
That must be tough.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.945
All I want is
to do something with Zack,

12:58.945 --> 13:00.446
just the two of us.

13:00.446 --> 13:03.783
‐But did you ask Craig?
‐House rules.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.994
I can only leave at night
with a parent‐‐ you.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.955
‐Maddie, you know that I can't‐‐
‐It's all I want,

13:08.955 --> 13:11.165
‐just dinner with Zack.
‐(sighs)

13:11.165 --> 13:13.251
You can pick me up,
you can take me.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.630
We won't drink. I promise.

13:20.758 --> 13:21.968
Please.

13:25.430 --> 13:28.599
If I lose Zack,
if I lose my friends...

13:31.269 --> 13:32.812
then I have nothing.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.154
Three hours, tops.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.657
‐Thank you. (laughs)
‐Oh.

13:47.744 --> 13:50.079
Thank you.
Thanks, Mom.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.667
Paul, there are
two more couples who want

13:54.667 --> 13:57.795
to book La Coletta Manor
on our wedding date.

13:57.795 --> 14:01.007
Remember? It's the one
with the chef's carving station
and all those swans?

14:01.007 --> 14:03.259
(chuckles)
The chefs don't carve
the swans, do they?

14:03.259 --> 14:07.472
Ha ha. We really need
to decide today.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.392
Cynthia, you know
how much I love you, right?

14:11.392 --> 14:15.146
‐I do.
‐I just can't pretend
I understand party stuff.

14:15.146 --> 14:17.774
‐It all looks the same to me.
‐Babe, you can do it.

14:17.774 --> 14:21.861
Pretend! It's no fun doing
all of this stuff by myself.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.363
But I'm a terrible pretender
and you know what I think.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.948
With all of this money,
we could‐‐

14:25.948 --> 14:27.533
we could get a bigger condo.

14:29.577 --> 14:33.372
Listen. To me, the wedding's
just another day.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.375
Spending the rest of my life
with the most amazing
woman in the world?

14:37.460 --> 14:39.212
That's what I'm focused on.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.880
‐Okay?
‐Okay.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.341
So, look... plan away,

14:43.341 --> 14:46.052
go crazy, go nuts...
within our budget.

14:47.095 --> 14:48.471
Okay.

14:51.849 --> 14:55.520
Yes, the Molina‐Morell wedding.
We'll take the silver package.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.855
Woman on phone:
<i>Wonderful! Would you</i>
<i>like to upgrade</i>

14:57.855 --> 15:01.734
<i>from the roses to orchids</i>
<i>and from the beef tenderloin</i>
<i>to beef Wellington?</i>

15:01.734 --> 15:05.238
Yes, we would.
That would be lovely.
Thank you.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.572
<i>‐Hold on one moment.</i>
‐(engine starts)

15:06.572 --> 15:08.908
<i>I'll be back</i>
<i>with a preliminary estimate.</i>

15:08.908 --> 15:12.036
Sure. I have all day.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.122
(jazz music playing
on phone)

15:15.498 --> 15:16.958
(cell phone chimes)

15:16.958 --> 15:18.543
‐Crap.
‐(car honks)

15:18.543 --> 15:19.877
(crashes)

15:23.047 --> 15:25.550
What the hell
were you thinking?

15:25.550 --> 15:27.552
‐What?
‐You pulled behind me,
no warning!

15:27.552 --> 15:29.887
‐Hey, you slammed into me.
‐Yeah, and I wouldn't have

15:29.887 --> 15:31.848
if you'd been using
your eyes to see.

15:31.848 --> 15:34.642
News flash:
Other people exist.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.685
All right, lady.

15:35.685 --> 15:38.229
‐(phone camera clicking)
‐Oh! Oh! (screams)

15:38.229 --> 15:42.441
You have been trying to control,
change, and manipulate me
since sophomore year!

15:42.441 --> 15:46.696
Oh, get over yourself, Vern!
I am not trying to change you.

15:46.696 --> 15:50.950
‐I love you.
‐So, what? All of a sudden,
you want to be my friend again?

15:50.950 --> 15:53.286
‐When you just shut
us all out? All of us?
‐I had to!

15:53.286 --> 15:55.538
‐I needed to!
‐I was your best friend!

15:55.538 --> 15:58.249
And I'm sorry I had to.
I had to draw boundaries.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.960
‐(both shouting)
‐I hate this holier‐than‐thou
attitude, okay?

16:00.960 --> 16:03.379
How many times have
I held your hair while
you barfed in the bathroom?

16:20.438 --> 16:22.982
Let me get this straight.
There is no chef?

16:22.982 --> 16:24.984
‐No.
‐And the guests‐‐

16:24.984 --> 16:28.154
‐Residents.
‐...have to cook all the food
and take turns doing the dishes?

16:28.154 --> 16:30.489
‐Yes!
‐And the dishes don't match?

16:30.489 --> 16:32.241
She's right.
The dishes don't match.

16:32.241 --> 16:35.661
(scoffs) Okay, I don't think
I like this kind of sobriety.

16:41.584 --> 16:44.420
Hey. Need some help?

16:44.420 --> 16:47.089
‐Seriously?
‐Sure. What can I do?

16:47.089 --> 16:48.883
It‐‐ it's so nice of you
to want to help.

16:48.883 --> 16:51.010
I‐‐ I'm just setting the table.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.887
You think we're jerks,
don't you?

16:52.887 --> 16:56.641
I don't. I swear.
I do, but not you.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.976
They don't get it.
They're new to the program.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.145
This isn't my first time
at the rodeo.

17:02.313 --> 17:05.107
I'm so sorry to do this.
I think you're radiant,

17:05.107 --> 17:06.692
and I've seen all your movies,

17:06.692 --> 17:09.028
and I really think
you deserve all those
People's Choice awards.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.740
You smell so nice,
and you're like a millennial
Grace Kelly.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.992
‐So am not.
‐So you is.

17:14.992 --> 17:19.288
‐(both laugh)
‐Do you wanna sit
at my table, baby?

17:19.288 --> 17:21.207
Oh no, don't set one for me.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.709
Oh, you're not coming
to dinner?

17:23.709 --> 17:26.629
I'm on a juice cleanse.
Do you like juicing?

17:26.629 --> 17:28.172
I mean,
it's kind of hard, right?

17:28.172 --> 17:29.757
But it's always better
with a buddy.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.801
Do you wanna be
my juice buddy?

17:37.306 --> 17:40.017
So, a small party
in a hotel suite

17:40.017 --> 17:42.353
‐with dancing
and cake and stuff.
‐(cell phone buzzing)

17:42.353 --> 17:44.272
I mean, doesn't that
sound like fun?

17:44.272 --> 17:48.192
‐Uh‐huh.
‐I mean, you're a guy.
Wouldn't that be fun?

17:48.192 --> 17:49.402
Uh‐huh.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.947
Hmm. Planning this party...

17:52.947 --> 17:55.616
I feel...
back in control.

17:55.616 --> 17:59.245
I actually feel like I have
my real life back.

17:59.245 --> 18:02.206
Your real life.
What does that make
all of us? Pretend?

18:03.749 --> 18:05.876
Okay, practical question.

18:07.253 --> 18:10.172
How are you bankrolling
this shindig?

18:10.172 --> 18:11.799
Zack and I have
a T‐shirt business.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.511
Zack.
That's your boyfriend, right?

18:15.511 --> 18:20.057
No, Zack's the invisible gnome
that lives under my bed
and makes quilts.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.976
Yes, Zack, my boyfriend.

18:22.977 --> 18:26.772
And... your mom
doesn't know about this?

18:26.772 --> 18:29.692
She said we can go to dinner,
but it's his 18th.

18:29.692 --> 18:32.612
I realize
I have to make this epic.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.656
‐Hmm.
‐And you're gonna stay sober?

18:35.656 --> 18:40.286
Seriously, it's one night.
I think I can stay sober
for one night.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.955
Sure.

18:42.955 --> 18:48.044
It's just that this is
the first party you will have
been to since you've been here.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.923
You really think
you're gonna be able to...

18:54.925 --> 18:57.053
just be around
all your friends,

18:57.053 --> 18:59.263
drinking and using
and not be tempted?

19:04.101 --> 19:07.521
Yes. And I find
your complete lack
of confidence in me

19:07.521 --> 19:09.357
highly disruptive
to my sobriety.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.159
(phone camera clicks)

19:20.159 --> 19:22.244
(types)

19:30.086 --> 19:34.799
It's kale, parsley,
and hairy birdnob root.
So clean, right?

19:34.799 --> 19:39.136
‐Uh‐huh.
‐We consume all of this stuff
that's killing us.

19:39.136 --> 19:42.139
It's toxic, carby, and gross.

19:42.139 --> 19:44.642
And we say,
"Ooh, it's so delicious."

19:44.642 --> 19:46.936
And we review it
in restaurants

19:46.936 --> 19:50.356
and pass the recipe
for this gross stuff
around on the Internet.

19:50.356 --> 19:53.776
(scoffs)
We're so screwed up
as a culture.

19:53.776 --> 19:55.444
‐Preach.
‐Mmm.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.698
Okay, can you keep a secret?

20:00.533 --> 20:05.329
I'm auditioning
to be the she‐wolf
in the new <i>Horizon</i> trilogy.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.998
Ah! I love
the <i>Horizon</i> trilogy!

20:07.998 --> 20:10.751
Shut up.
No way. Shut up.

20:10.751 --> 20:13.462
So, I don't think
they really think I can do it.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.381
‐Mmm.
‐I mean, I think
they just called me in

20:15.381 --> 20:17.925
because of all
my bad publicity lately.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.386
To them, I'm just some
"crazy tabloid girl

20:20.386 --> 20:23.013
with three misdemeanors
and two DUI's."

20:23.013 --> 20:26.726
They're wrong. You would be
rhinestone‐encrusted genius.

20:26.726 --> 20:27.727
(gasps)

20:29.019 --> 20:30.479
Crazy idea.

20:30.479 --> 20:33.607
If I get the job,
do you wanna come
to the set with me?

20:33.607 --> 20:38.154
Every day.
You know, run lines,
get my juice, help me out?

20:38.154 --> 20:43.242
I know we've just met,
but I'm an instinctual person.

20:43.242 --> 20:46.203
Every call I make‐‐
my life, my work‐‐

20:46.203 --> 20:48.998
comes from
my most fertile space.

20:48.998 --> 20:51.375
And I think we've got
a connection. Am I right?

20:51.375 --> 20:53.878
Yeah, but we live
in a sober house.

20:53.878 --> 20:56.213
What about all the mandatory
check‐ins and curfews?

20:56.213 --> 20:59.592
There are no mandatory
check‐ins and curfews.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.511
They bring
everything we need to us.

21:04.889 --> 21:06.640
So, what do you think?

21:07.933 --> 21:09.727
I think you need
to get this role.

21:09.727 --> 21:11.896
‐(both laugh)
‐Oh my God.

21:15.232 --> 21:18.861
<i>‐Babe, it's late. What's up?</i>
‐Well, I miss you.

21:18.861 --> 21:22.239
<i>I miss you too.</i>
<i>Wanna hang out</i>
<i>tomorrow night?</i>

21:22.239 --> 21:24.200
I thought you were
going to a concert.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.951
<i>Benji has an extra ticket.</i>

21:25.951 --> 21:28.662
Mmm. I'm sorry, I can't.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.792
‐Maddie, I know
something's up with you.
‐Nothing's up.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.960
<i>No, I know</i>
<i>something is up with you,</i>

21:34.960 --> 21:37.505
<i>and I just need to tell you</i>
<i>that you can tell me anything.</i>

21:37.505 --> 21:40.841
<i>Okay?</i>
<i>You're a tough girl, Mad.</i>

21:40.841 --> 21:42.843
<i>That's one reason</i>
<i>why I love you,</i>

21:42.843 --> 21:44.595
<i>but keeping stuff in?</i>

21:45.888 --> 21:48.766
<i>That ain't good for you.</i>
<i>And I'm right here,</i>

21:48.766 --> 21:50.768
<i>your buddy in crime,</i>
<i>ready to listen.</i>

21:55.314 --> 21:57.650
Hoo. Okay.

21:59.777 --> 22:01.153
Okay.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.532
Here's the thing.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.164
It's nothing.

22:14.583 --> 22:15.960
<i>I love you, Mad.</i>

22:15.960 --> 22:17.628
(stammers)

22:23.717 --> 22:25.261
Love you, too.

22:36.230 --> 22:38.899
I got your 9‐1‐1 text.
What's wrong?

22:38.899 --> 22:41.318
I have to know.

22:41.318 --> 22:43.571
Do my boobs
look weird in this shirt?

22:46.574 --> 22:49.368
I'm telling you
the God's honest truth. Yes.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.370
I know! Right?

22:51.370 --> 22:54.874
Oh my God, it's so good to have
a friend I can finally trust.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.752
I win, as per usual.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.546
‐(laughs) Okay. Relax.
‐Hello.

23:00.546 --> 23:03.507
‐That's‐‐ You're cheating.
‐No, I'm not.

23:03.507 --> 23:04.508
You're...

23:06.302 --> 23:07.344
Oh, hey.

23:09.972 --> 23:13.225
Hi, Rebecca.
How have you been?

23:15.019 --> 23:17.521
Just coming to pick up Maddie.
We're going to dinner.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.150
‐Hi, Mom.
‐Hi.

23:21.150 --> 23:23.027
Oh, you look... nice.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.238
Aw. Thanks, Mom.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.033
Okay, let's go.
I'm starving.

23:29.033 --> 23:31.285
Craig:
Oh, have a great dinner, ladies.

23:31.285 --> 23:33.037
You'll bring me back
some tiramisu, won't you?

23:36.248 --> 23:37.416
Bye.

23:44.715 --> 23:46.717
She's not going to dinner
with her mom, is she?

23:54.391 --> 23:56.977
‐♪ Who wants to pre‐game? ♪
‐♪ Me! ♪

23:56.977 --> 23:59.605
Let's just get this done.
He's supposed to be
here already.

23:59.605 --> 24:02.816
Maddie, Maddie, Maddie,
my friend. It is a party.

24:02.816 --> 24:04.068
(rock music playing)

24:04.068 --> 24:05.527
‐Here you go.
‐(giggles)

24:05.527 --> 24:07.446
‐So excited!
‐I'm so glad, too.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.323
‐Okay, cheers.
‐Mm‐hmm.

24:09.323 --> 24:11.742
‐It's gonna be a fun night.
‐Cheers!

24:12.952 --> 24:14.328
(cell phone buzzes)

24:14.328 --> 24:15.704
They're getting off
the elevator.

24:15.704 --> 24:18.332
‐They're getting
off the elevator.
‐Okay. I will get the door.

24:18.332 --> 24:20.584
‐Okay. Shh, shh!
Time to hide!
‐(music stops)

24:23.087 --> 24:24.254
Shh!

24:26.590 --> 24:28.926
‐Hi, Zack!
‐What's up?

24:28.926 --> 24:32.429
Hey, guys.
Hi, we're just
hanging out here.

24:32.429 --> 24:34.264
Surprise!

24:34.264 --> 24:36.850
(cheering)

24:36.850 --> 24:39.228
‐Happy birthday, babe!
‐(music continues)

24:41.897 --> 24:44.733
‐I thought you'd forgotten.
‐Oh, usually people
pretend to do that

24:44.733 --> 24:47.653
when they throw
a surprise party. Wow.

24:48.904 --> 24:51.031
‐I love you.
‐Happy birthday.

24:56.286 --> 24:59.248
You know, I've been worried
about you, about us.

24:59.248 --> 25:02.251
Well, don't be.
I love us.

25:02.251 --> 25:05.379
Yeah, I'm not now.
No wonder you were missing.

25:05.379 --> 25:07.131
You must've been planning
this for weeks.

25:07.131 --> 25:08.549
‐A'ight.
‐Damn.

25:12.011 --> 25:15.139
Babe, I've been thinking...
about our future.

25:15.139 --> 25:18.225
Maybe we should go
on a road trip this summer,
just the two of us.

25:19.309 --> 25:20.769
That would be great.

25:21.937 --> 25:24.857
And I was e‐‐
and I was even thinking

25:24.857 --> 25:27.609
we could both go
to college in New York.

25:27.609 --> 25:31.196
‐Kinda crazy, right?
‐Whoo! Okay, it's pill time,
you guys.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.365
You know this game.
Everybody picks one.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.577
‐Birthday boy first,
and then Maddie.
‐What the hell.

25:36.577 --> 25:38.537
Track practice doesn't start
for three weeks.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.622
(laughs)

25:46.128 --> 25:50.507
You know, I... don't think
I wanna start with that.

25:50.507 --> 25:52.968
I wanna start
with cocktails.

25:52.968 --> 25:56.513
Go crazy,
go wild. Okay.

25:56.513 --> 25:58.348
Okay. Yes, you guys.

26:01.101 --> 26:04.104
All right, this is
a famous woman in Malibu.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.731
‐Barbie!
‐No, she's a real person.

26:05.731 --> 26:06.774
‐Me!
‐Her.

26:06.774 --> 26:09.193
‐(snorts)
‐What? He said
she was famous.

26:09.193 --> 26:11.236
‐(cell phone chirps)
‐He also said
she was real.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.363
(flatly)
Oh, it's from Olivia.
She's texting me.

26:13.363 --> 26:15.699
‐Is she in the kitchen?
‐She texted you
from the kitchen?

26:15.699 --> 26:18.327
‐It's 50 feet away.
‐She's texted me 20 times today.

26:19.870 --> 26:21.914
‐Suzanne Somers.
‐No, no, no, Barbra Streisand.

26:21.914 --> 26:22.956
‐No, Caitlyn Jenner!
‐Yes!

26:22.956 --> 26:24.666
‐Yes.
‐(chattering)

26:24.666 --> 26:27.544
All right, everybody.

26:27.544 --> 26:31.381
Okay, this is
something you need
in the world.

26:31.381 --> 26:32.382
‐Power.
‐Power.

26:32.382 --> 26:33.801
‐No, this is
something tangible.
‐Friends.

26:33.801 --> 26:36.553
This is something that
the Destinations people have.

26:36.553 --> 26:37.721
‐Class!
‐Respect!

26:37.721 --> 26:40.599
No. Something that
they have but we don't.

26:40.599 --> 26:41.892
Bedbugs!

26:50.567 --> 26:52.152
‐(rock music playing)
‐Hey, want some?

26:52.152 --> 26:53.237
No.

27:16.218 --> 27:18.387
Great party, Mads.
Can I top you off?

27:18.387 --> 27:21.140
I'm good.
Let's do the video.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.808
I can't believe
you made a video.

27:22.808 --> 27:25.602
Since when did you become
sentimental and crafty?

27:25.602 --> 27:27.688
I'm trying some new things.

27:29.314 --> 27:32.025
Are you okay? Are you good?

27:32.025 --> 27:33.902
I don't know.
I've just been getting a vibe

27:33.902 --> 27:35.863
that you're pissed at me
or something.

27:35.863 --> 27:38.490
‐God, no!
‐No?

27:38.490 --> 27:40.492
I've been feeling
the same thing too.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.370
Come here.
(laughs)

27:44.997 --> 27:47.499
I guess we're good.
We're good, right?

27:47.499 --> 27:49.084
We're great.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.964
So, go do your crafty,
sentimental video thing.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.551
Uh, everyone,

27:57.551 --> 28:00.846
can you all gather around?
Come on.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.556
‐(music stops)
‐All: Aww.

28:02.556 --> 28:06.560
I know. Boo‐hoo.
Wah, wah. Please.

28:06.560 --> 28:10.022
Zack, I admittedly was surprised
when you asked me out

28:10.022 --> 28:12.733
five months, eight days
and 19 minutes ago,

28:12.733 --> 28:15.777
‐but hey, who's counting?
‐(laughter)

28:18.030 --> 28:20.532
Zack, I've made this for you.

28:21.575 --> 28:23.160
Happy 18th.

‐Your turn to pick tonight.
‐Yes!

29:12.042 --> 29:15.629
But... no blood,
no horror, and no cop movies...

29:15.629 --> 29:17.381
unless Brad Pitt's in it.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.550
‐So, you wanna watch <i>Seven?</i>
‐Oh yeah.

29:20.550 --> 29:22.094
‐(cell phone rings)
‐Oh.

29:23.345 --> 29:25.722
It's a sponsee.
She's having a day.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.226
You okay? Yeah.

29:30.894 --> 29:34.564
Light a candle, meditate‐‐
do whatever you can
to ground yourself.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.110
Perfect.

29:39.236 --> 29:40.404
Okay, call me tomorrow.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.579
Cynth, were you
texting a sponsee today
when you hit that car?

29:53.542 --> 29:56.086
(sighs) Yeah.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.131
Rikki's son is in trouble again.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.424
It's a really big trigger
for her.

30:00.424 --> 30:02.843
I'm sorry for Rikki, I am,

30:02.843 --> 30:04.928
but my priority is us.

30:04.928 --> 30:07.347
‐Mine too.
‐Is it?

30:09.641 --> 30:12.811
I mean, you're just so busy
with weddings, sponsees,

30:12.811 --> 30:14.521
and the kids at school.
I mean, now you're...

30:15.772 --> 30:18.150
texting and driving.
You could've been killed.

30:18.150 --> 30:21.486
It was a parking lot, Paul,
but it won't happen again.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.780
You know I have commitments,

30:23.780 --> 30:25.615
and you said
you love my compassion.

30:25.615 --> 30:27.451
I do. I do.

30:29.619 --> 30:32.205
You're just up
in so many people's business.

30:33.331 --> 30:35.000
I'm a simple man, Cynth.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.252
I want to go to work
and do a great job,

30:37.252 --> 30:39.755
and the rest of my time
I want to spend with you,

30:39.755 --> 30:42.257
connecting and being happy.

30:42.257 --> 30:44.301
The wedding is
the one thing I wanted,

30:44.301 --> 30:48.263
and AA‐‐ it's not negotiable.
You know that.

30:48.263 --> 30:50.766
Y‐You've been sober
for so many years now,

30:50.766 --> 30:52.768
I guess I just‐‐

30:52.768 --> 30:55.395
I don't understand
why you still have to do this
every single day.

30:56.438 --> 30:58.732
I know you don't.

30:58.732 --> 31:00.484
You can't.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.698
(sighs)

31:11.828 --> 31:13.789
‐Where you going?
‐Nah.

31:13.789 --> 31:15.874
I'm gonna go downstairs
and do some reading.

31:15.874 --> 31:19.669
‐Can't we just talk this out?
‐We will, just not now.

31:19.669 --> 31:21.379
I don't wanna
say anything I'll regret.

31:28.136 --> 31:29.513
(sniffs)

31:29.513 --> 31:31.640
I found you
a top‐notch rehab facility.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.101
I hope they have
a top‐notch refund policy.

31:34.101 --> 31:37.729
‐And when you're outta there...
‐(sniffs)

31:37.729 --> 31:39.231
I know a great sober house.

31:41.650 --> 31:43.235
You can't make me leave here.
(laughs)

31:43.235 --> 31:45.403
You literally can't!
I'm bigger than you!

31:52.786 --> 31:53.912
That's us!

31:56.498 --> 31:58.083
High as freaking kites!

31:58.083 --> 32:00.961
Sarah's gone!
Now Rob is gone!

32:02.462 --> 32:04.714
I'm not gonna be the last one
left alive in that picture.

32:16.852 --> 32:18.186
All right. You win, bitch.

32:26.153 --> 32:28.196
(crying)

32:50.302 --> 32:54.431
‐(rock music playing)
‐(laughing, chatting)

33:19.664 --> 33:21.041
Hey, babe.

33:22.292 --> 33:24.544
‐What's wrong, babe?
‐Nothing.

33:26.046 --> 33:27.422
Good.

33:27.422 --> 33:30.967
Because I've been thinking...

33:30.967 --> 33:33.845
maybe we should
go on a road trip
this summer, huh?

33:33.845 --> 33:36.723
Just me and you. Just us.

33:37.724 --> 33:41.686
And... what do
you think about‐‐

33:41.686 --> 33:45.065
about us both going
to college in New York?

33:49.361 --> 33:50.445
Hey.

34:01.831 --> 34:03.541
I gotta get outta here.

34:18.431 --> 34:21.685
‐Thank you, Wes.
‐(ringing)

34:21.685 --> 34:24.229
‐Cucumber.
‐It's‐‐ it's a scar.

34:24.229 --> 34:26.773
It's a p‐‐ it's a penis!
It's a penis with wings!

34:26.773 --> 34:29.234
It's a World War II
vintage biplane.

34:29.234 --> 34:31.820
Yes! Ugh!

34:32.988 --> 34:34.447
Hello.

34:34.447 --> 34:36.908
Okay. Bye.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.327
Wait. Where are you going?

34:40.412 --> 34:42.998
I have to run an errand.
Do you want to come?

34:42.998 --> 34:44.666
Sure, I need cigarettes,
anyway.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.878
Hairy breasts.

34:48.878 --> 34:52.632
‐Yes! Yes!
‐(laughs) Yeah!

34:52.632 --> 34:54.592
Okay, so when
I go in and get her,
you should wait outside,

34:54.592 --> 34:57.220
because I think
there's gonna be a lot
of drugs and alcohol there,

34:57.220 --> 34:58.847
and you only have
20 days sober.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.682
And you really don't need
to see that right now.

35:00.682 --> 35:02.559
‐It's no problem.
‐You sure?

35:02.559 --> 35:05.353
Absolutely. I haven't had
a drink in five years.

35:05.353 --> 35:07.022
Wait. What?

35:07.022 --> 35:10.025
What about the DUI
and the meltdown?

35:10.025 --> 35:11.943
Why are you living
in a sober house?

35:11.943 --> 35:14.613
‐My publicist's idea.
‐Your publicist?

35:14.613 --> 35:16.740
It's kind of genius, right?

35:16.740 --> 35:18.700
I mean, nobody was talking
about me for years.

35:18.700 --> 35:22.329
I couldn't get an audition.
I had no idea what
I was going to do.

35:22.329 --> 35:24.956
Now, bam,
I'm on every tabloid.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.125
I'm auditioning
for <i>Horizons.</i>

35:28.293 --> 35:31.796
Okay, I'm pressing pause
on this for a second.

35:31.796 --> 35:35.967
You faked a relapse
for attention and publicity?

35:35.967 --> 35:39.554
‐Yup, and it worked.
‐Okay, whatever, dude.

35:39.554 --> 35:40.930
I can't.

35:40.930 --> 35:42.849
This isn't easy, you know.

35:42.849 --> 35:44.851
What? Sobriety?

35:44.851 --> 35:46.603
No, fame.

35:47.687 --> 35:50.398
Sobriety is easy
in comparison.

35:50.398 --> 35:52.817
Yeah, I wouldn't know.

35:52.817 --> 35:53.818
I guess not.

35:55.445 --> 35:59.157
Wait. Do you want
to go to ballet class
on the weekend?

36:02.035 --> 36:03.662
Oh, bollocks!

36:04.788 --> 36:07.165
Two sticks of butter,
one bag of marshmallows.

36:07.165 --> 36:10.001
‐Hey, is Vern around?
‐What? No, no,
he's on an errand.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.462
"Melt them together
over high heat."
Yes, doing that.

36:12.462 --> 36:15.507
You do know that
that's the easiest recipe
in the world, right?

36:15.507 --> 36:19.594
‐Really? Then why on Earth‐‐
‐Well, you've gotta stir it,
otherwise, it's gonna burn

36:19.594 --> 36:21.012
What? It just says
to melt them together.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.682
‐(scoffs)
‐It doesn't say,
"Stir it like hell."

36:23.682 --> 36:25.475
Why didn't it say that?
I would've done that.

36:25.475 --> 36:27.310
I take directions very,
very well.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.604
‐Good. Pour in the cereal.
‐Yes. Yes, Miss Molina.

36:29.604 --> 36:32.607
‐Easy! You're spilling it.
‐Don't‐‐ Okay.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.192
‐(laughs)
‐Is that all right?

36:34.192 --> 36:35.527
‐That's fine.
‐I can interfere?

36:35.527 --> 36:37.821
‐Come on, faster.
‐I feel like one of the kids
at school now.

36:37.821 --> 36:39.656
Now I know why
Maddie didn't like you.

36:42.701 --> 36:43.743
(laughs)

36:43.743 --> 36:46.162
(rock music playing)

36:46.162 --> 36:49.290
Excuse me,
have you seen Maddie Graham?
It's a family emergency.

36:49.290 --> 36:50.709
I'm her uncle.

36:51.960 --> 36:54.254

Wait, wait. Wait.
Did Maddie just leave
with Olivia O'Brien?

37:23.408 --> 37:25.034
(laughs)

37:26.411 --> 37:29.080
Dude, we are so messed up.

Nyla: What?

37:37.213 --> 37:39.048
Wait. No.

37:47.015 --> 37:50.602
You just don't get it, Maddie.
We need each other
to stay sober.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.606
I have three years,
and I need you to help me.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.107
That's how
this house works.

37:57.525 --> 38:00.236
You can't just
keep screwing up like this.
It affects everyone.

38:00.236 --> 38:02.906
‐You most of all.
‐I get it. I do.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.699
He's right, Maddie.

38:04.699 --> 38:08.495
You really think you're entitled
to lecture someone on how
sober living works?

38:08.495 --> 38:09.496
What?

38:12.832 --> 38:13.917
I can't with her.

38:16.377 --> 38:18.171
Do you want to go
