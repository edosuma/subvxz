WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:03.953
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

00:04.040 --> 00:05.474
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

00:05.560 --> 00:07.199
<i>To the outside world,</i>

00:07.280 --> 00:09.192
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist,</i>

00:09.320 --> 00:12.313
<i>but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.400 --> 00:15.154
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.240 --> 00:17.550
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help,</i>

00:17.640 --> 00:19.871
<i>she changed the present,</i>

00:19.960 --> 00:22.475
<i>and now our world is
more dangerous than ever,</i>

00:22.560 --> 00:24.870
<i>and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:28.277
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:28.360 --> 00:29.874
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:29.960 --> 00:30.880
I'll deliver it myself.

00:30.881 --> 00:32.917
<i>That is Eobard Thawne,
the Reverse Flash.</i>

00:33.000 --> 00:34.616
- He killed my mother.
- I didn't know that.

00:34.640 --> 00:36.154
My life is a million times
better

00:36.240 --> 00:37.799
and it's all because of you,
Gracie.

00:40.560 --> 00:42.836
<i>She may never wake.</i>

00:42.920 --> 00:47.836
Every meta will die.

00:47.920 --> 00:49.991
This is a DNA sample
from Cicada.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.992
We can make
a meta-human cure.

00:52.080 --> 00:54.400
What if the key to defeating
him is appealing to his heart?

00:54.480 --> 00:56.551
- How do we do that?
- By saving his child.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.632
<i>We need to wake up Grace.</i>

01:00.800 --> 01:02.000
<i>I want you to think about</i>

01:02.080 --> 01:03.878
<i>the biggest secret
in your life.</i>

01:04.000 --> 01:06.913
The one you keep from
the people that you love

01:07.000 --> 01:09.196
or even from yourself.

01:09.280 --> 01:11.112
I want you to imagine
what would happen

01:11.200 --> 01:14.079
if that secret got out.

01:14.160 --> 01:16.629
Remember when you asked
me that?

01:16.760 --> 01:19.832
<i>I've been using all of
your training.</i>

01:19.920 --> 01:23.880
<i>Steadying my pulse,
managing micro-expressions,</i>

01:23.960 --> 01:25.713
<i>limiting non-congruent
gestures,</i>

01:25.800 --> 01:28.952
<i>destroying any piece
of evidence.</i>

01:29.040 --> 01:32.078
<i>I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.</i>

01:33.400 --> 01:35.596
<i>And not just because of
the risks.</i>

01:38.000 --> 01:41.437
<i>But because the closer
I get to my parents,</i>

01:42.120 --> 01:44.589
<i>the more I feel like
I'm hurting them.</i>

01:45.720 --> 01:47.473
Data entry complete, Gideon.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.957
<i>Thank you, Nora West-Allen.</i>

01:50.040 --> 01:52.350
<i>Shall I send this
to the usual recipient?</i>

01:53.080 --> 01:54.480
Yes.

01:54.560 --> 01:56.677
Send it to Eobard Thawne,

01:56.800 --> 01:59.315
priority level urgent.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.349
You ready for this?

02:06.440 --> 02:08.113
Dad, I'm just... I'm not
fast enough yet.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.840
No backing out now, this is
the biggest race of your life.

02:10.919 --> 02:13.674
- Get ready, set, go!
- Not really. Dad, Dad...

02:13.760 --> 02:16.798
Wait, wait!
Oh, God.

02:18.120 --> 02:20.191
Whoa, whoa.

02:20.280 --> 02:21.953
Gotcha.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.838
This is so embarrassing.

02:23.920 --> 02:28.631
I'm really good at the ice
skating game on my Pocket Pal!

02:28.720 --> 02:30.136
Okay, you're just gonna bend
your knees...

02:30.160 --> 02:31.753
- 'Kay.
- And lean forward a little.

02:31.880 --> 02:33.155
Just, yeah.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.515
Yeah.

02:34.600 --> 02:35.616
- I'm doing it.
- You're doing it.

02:35.640 --> 02:38.280
I'm skating.
This is like schway city, Mom.

02:38.360 --> 02:39.794
Thanks.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.551
Look at you guys.

02:45.640 --> 02:48.109
Such a mom.
What? What about you?

02:48.200 --> 02:50.874
You're the one who sprang
for ice skating and game night.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.634
Yeah, well,
I know when Nora got hurt,

02:53.720 --> 02:55.632
I got a little frustrated.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.960
And now, I mean, we have
an actual plan to stop Cicada.

02:59.040 --> 03:02.078
Waking up his niece
to appeal to his heart.

03:02.200 --> 03:05.637
I know Dwyer's a killer,
but he's still a person,

03:05.720 --> 03:07.473
and he loves Grace
just like we love Nora.

03:07.560 --> 03:08.696
So I don't know.
I just feel like

03:08.720 --> 03:10.440
everything's heading
in the right direction.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.557
Here I come. Coming in.
Here we go.

03:12.640 --> 03:14.136
I'm sorry,
why are you wearing a helmet?

03:14.160 --> 03:15.456
I thought you were made
of rubber.

03:15.480 --> 03:17.136
Somebody's gotta set a good
example for these kids.

03:17.160 --> 03:19.231
Hold on, I thought you grew up
on the ice.

03:19.320 --> 03:20.640
Well, I did, basically.

03:20.760 --> 03:23.320
My mom dated a Zamboni
operator, so...

03:23.400 --> 03:26.677
And I tell you where I'm from
we don't date Zamboni drivers.

03:26.760 --> 03:28.479
Why is that?
Because there are no Zambonis.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.398
How do we clear the ice?
All winter long,

03:30.520 --> 03:32.671
we are on our hands and knees
with a squeegee in hand.

03:32.760 --> 03:33.760
Let me tell you.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.832
Best eight months of
the year for this guy.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.320
It's a really great story,
Sherlock.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.400
Sherloque.

03:38.480 --> 03:39.880
You know,
speaking of squeegeeing,

03:39.960 --> 03:41.256
you know who could use
a good squeegeeing

03:41.280 --> 03:44.432
is Larry Blumenthal.
He's dead.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.557
- Larry Blumenthal is dead?
- Yeah.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.632
The patent registrar across
the hall from you

03:48.720 --> 03:50.518
with the 400 square footage...

03:50.600 --> 03:51.954
And the courtyard views?

03:52.040 --> 03:53.076
Yeah, dead as a doornail.

03:53.160 --> 03:54.896
You can have that place
if you want it. Yours to rent.

03:54.920 --> 03:56.559
What? Oh, my God.
This is perfect.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.791
I mean, my ad revenue has been
up this quarter, so...

03:58.880 --> 04:00.576
Yeah, with the extra space
you'd be able to hire

04:00.600 --> 04:02.353
editors, photographers.

04:02.440 --> 04:05.558
I could turn my blog into
a real newspaper.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.637
Oh, my package has arrived.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.313
What package?

04:09.400 --> 04:11.596
This is the solution
to all our problems.

04:11.680 --> 04:14.320
<i>Allez, les amis.</i>
We must go.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.640
<i>Madames et monsieurs,
may I present to you</i>

04:18.720 --> 04:20.791
<i>La Machine à Mémoire,</i>

04:20.880 --> 04:22.599
or as they say in <i>Amérique,</i>
you know...

04:22.680 --> 04:24.416
- The Memory Machine.
<i>- Oui,</i> Iris.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.716
Memory Machine.
Many times...

04:26.800 --> 04:29.156
I have entered into
people's minds

04:29.240 --> 04:30.959
using this very technology.

04:31.080 --> 04:32.878
From the unfortunate
comatose victims

04:33.000 --> 04:34.673
<i>of the Summerholt Institute
to, yes,</i>

04:34.760 --> 04:36.353
Jervis Tetch himself,

04:36.440 --> 04:38.875
the Terrible Mad Hatter Killer
from Earth-221.

04:38.960 --> 04:42.078
I come back from Tannhauser
for one second,

04:42.160 --> 04:44.994
just borrowing a splicer
for the meta cure

04:45.080 --> 04:46.560
and what do I find?

04:46.680 --> 04:48.558
- This, this...
<i>- Machine à Mémoire.</i>

04:48.680 --> 04:51.832
Whatever. How did you even
get this here from Earth-221?

04:51.920 --> 04:54.276
Well, I used the Forerunner
Multiversal Delivery Service.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.416
You don't use it? You don't
have a gold card like me?

04:56.440 --> 04:58.496
<i>- Maybe I'll get you a discount.</i>
- We don't need a discount.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.352
All right,
we just need to wake up Grace.

05:00.440 --> 05:01.715
This'll wake her up, right?

05:01.800 --> 05:03.917
So in most coma patients,

05:04.000 --> 05:05.832
high traffic areas
of brain activity

05:05.920 --> 05:09.357
go dormant and the low traffic
areas spring to life,

05:09.440 --> 05:11.796
but unfortunately,
Grace isn't normal.

05:11.880 --> 05:14.349
Not only has her coma lasted
longer than the average,

05:14.440 --> 05:16.591
but her consciousness
has isolated itself

05:16.680 --> 05:18.751
into one specific region,

05:18.880 --> 05:20.234
her long-term memories.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.312
It will be so facile,
easy peasy for you.

05:22.400 --> 05:26.599
All you do is you transmit
your brainwaves

05:26.720 --> 05:28.473
into Grace's memories, right?

05:28.560 --> 05:30.438
And then you'll lead
her consciousness

05:30.520 --> 05:33.194
out of a neural nexus portal.

05:33.280 --> 05:35.636
And Grace awakens.

05:35.720 --> 05:37.056
It's sort of like when
Barry woke me up

05:37.080 --> 05:38.673
when the Thinker trapped me.

05:38.760 --> 05:41.275
Surprisingly, that sounds
kind of easy peasy.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.960
As long as Grace's
unusual brain damage

05:44.040 --> 05:46.475
doesn't cause any
unforeseen risks.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.199
This is why I suggest
you travel in pairs

05:48.280 --> 05:49.416
when you're using
this technology.

05:49.440 --> 05:51.909
Every time I enter into
someone's memories

05:52.000 --> 05:54.469
when I use this I went
with my partner for sure.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.075
Your partner's name didn't
happen to be Watson, did it?

05:58.360 --> 06:00.636
No, his name was not Watson.

06:00.720 --> 06:03.076
His name was Watsune.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.416
Yes, together we went through
dozens of minds, together...

06:05.440 --> 06:08.160
until one time I found myself

06:08.240 --> 06:11.153
<i>in a memory of a motel room
in Montreal</i>

06:11.240 --> 06:15.519
where what do I find
but Watsune <i>en flagrant délit</i>

06:15.600 --> 06:18.752
in interpersonal relationship
with my wife,

06:18.840 --> 06:20.797
fourth wife, but still.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.111
You're saying you could see
your partner's memories?

06:23.200 --> 06:27.638
It's a possible side effect
of traveling in pairs.

06:28.600 --> 06:29.716
<i>And speaking of which,</i>

06:29.800 --> 06:31.296
which pairs would like
to volunteer for this mission?

06:31.320 --> 06:32.320
I suggest the speedsters

06:32.400 --> 06:33.616
<i>for this to be accomplished
so quick.</i>

06:33.640 --> 06:36.314
- Yeah.
- Elected.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.576
Hey, if you see a memory of me
stealing a blank Scrabble tile,

06:38.600 --> 06:40.096
it's not what it looks like,
all right?

06:40.120 --> 06:41.839
That's a good one, Dad.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.350
All that is left is to
connect this transceiver disc

06:44.440 --> 06:47.160
to Grace's EEG
and we can transmit.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.310
- Great.
- Great.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.616
All right,
first thing tomorrow,

06:49.640 --> 06:50.960
we save Grace.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.674
Any big plans for
the night off?

06:53.760 --> 06:55.274
I'm gonna crash.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.317
Killer Frost was up
all night watching movies

06:57.400 --> 06:59.835
from her two favorite Johns,
Woo and Hughes.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.196
Huh, I'm more of
a Ford and Waters man myself,

07:02.280 --> 07:05.114
but I will be up all night
yet again working with

07:05.200 --> 07:07.016
the radiated meta-human
sample you guys got me.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.952
There's something missing with
this cure.

07:09.040 --> 07:10.296
All right,
I'll see you guys later.

07:10.320 --> 07:11.549
- All right.
- Night.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.632
You know, there's something
that I'm missing too.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.996
- Your freshly healed hands.
- Odd choice of words.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.800
Well, I'm meeting with
an informant tonight

07:17.880 --> 07:19.837
and he might have a lead
on Dwyer's location,

07:19.920 --> 07:21.957
but I'm not sure
if I should trust him.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.316
So you need me to vibe him.
Look, man.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.711
I should really be working
on this cure.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.992
But my splicer algorithm

07:31.080 --> 07:33.754
won't technically
be done until 3:00 a.m.

07:33.840 --> 07:37.356
Thanks, man, this is,
this is really important work.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.920
Okay.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.279
Okay, Gideon,
how do I hack this thing

07:50.360 --> 07:52.192
so that Dad won't see
my memories?

07:52.280 --> 07:53.714
<i>In any configuration,</i>

07:53.800 --> 07:55.280
<i>if you and Barry Allen
go in together,</i>

07:55.360 --> 07:58.000
<i>you still risk exposing
your memories.</i>

07:58.120 --> 08:00.396
So I can't do anything.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.350
- Gideon, is that...
<i>- Grace Gibbons' brain waves.</i>

08:18.440 --> 08:19.640
<i>It would appear
Sherloque Wells</i>

08:19.720 --> 08:21.393
<i>has planted
the transceiver disc.</i>

08:21.520 --> 08:24.115
So I can go in alone.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.919
And I'll be back before
anyone notices,

08:26.000 --> 08:27.992
but by that time Grace'll be
awake anyway.

08:29.960 --> 08:32.111
<i>Activating brain wave
transmission.</i>

08:32.240 --> 08:35.870
<i>In three, two, one.</i>

08:43.000 --> 08:45.435
CCPD?

08:48.760 --> 08:50.194
<i>Okay, Jonesy,
who's the kid?</i>

08:50.280 --> 08:52.556
<i>We found her in the car
hiding under the seat.</i>

08:52.640 --> 08:54.711
Her parents were at the ATM
when the meta attacked.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.269
Damn.
We located her next of kin?

08:57.360 --> 08:59.033
Maybe an uncle.
Still tracking down

08:59.120 --> 09:00.349
his last known address.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.840
Well, she can't sleep on
this bench.

09:01.880 --> 09:04.190
We've gotta get her
out of here.

09:04.280 --> 09:07.557
God, poor kid.

09:07.640 --> 09:10.519
- Who are you?
- You can see me?

09:10.600 --> 09:13.593
Oh, right,
you're Grace's consciousness

09:13.680 --> 09:16.115
in her old memory.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.197
I'm Nora.

09:18.280 --> 09:21.318
Can you take me
to my parents?

09:21.400 --> 09:24.677
No, um, I can't,

09:24.760 --> 09:27.719
but if you come with me,
I can help you feel better.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.437
You know,

09:31.520 --> 09:35.434
when I was your age,
I had a friend just like this.

09:35.520 --> 09:38.274
I bet he'd like
to feel better too.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.237
Yeah.

09:45.320 --> 09:47.676
Okay.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.958
All right, Gracie,
let's get you through

09:51.040 --> 09:52.872
this portal and out of
your coma

09:52.960 --> 09:55.156
before anyone notices
I snuck in here.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.636
Oh, no.

09:57.720 --> 10:00.280
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.194
Oh, no.

10:04.280 --> 10:05.555
I'm trapped.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.757
We're gonna find
a way out of here, I promise.

10:11.880 --> 10:15.078
I feel like I've been in this
police station for a long time,

10:15.160 --> 10:17.595
and now I'm gonna be here
forever, aren't I?

10:17.720 --> 10:20.519
Just leave me alone.

10:20.640 --> 10:23.075
You know,
when I was your age,

10:23.160 --> 10:25.197
I had to come to this
very same police station

10:25.280 --> 10:27.590
all by myself too.

10:27.680 --> 10:30.320
- It's kind of scary in here.
- I'm not scared.

10:30.440 --> 10:34.150
Well, I was.
I'm scared all the time.

10:34.240 --> 10:37.916
In fact, once, there was
this really bad guy

10:38.000 --> 10:41.152
and he wanted to hurt a whole
lot of people on a plane.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.232
A meta?

10:43.320 --> 10:45.232
But I helped stop him.

10:45.320 --> 10:47.994
- Whoa, really?
- I was terrified, though.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.878
But you know what my secret is?

10:50.000 --> 10:53.596
I just imagine what will happen
after I do the thing.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.956
Do you want to try it?

10:56.040 --> 10:59.317
Okay, close your eyes,

10:59.400 --> 11:03.189
and think about what will
happen once you're out of here.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.749
I'll see Uncle Orlin.

11:07.680 --> 11:11.071
Let's find our way
out of here, okay?

11:11.160 --> 11:13.391
<i>So I can't use "Gazette"?</i>

11:13.480 --> 11:15.119
"Chronicle"?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.435
So the only name that's cleared
is <i>Central City Citizen.</i>

11:21.360 --> 11:23.716
Uh, yeah, yeah, thanks.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.317
Hey, who was that
on the phone?

11:27.320 --> 11:30.279
Um, a lawyer, she was
helping answer some questions

11:30.360 --> 11:32.750
about me starting a newspaper.

11:32.840 --> 11:34.479
That's cool.
What'd she say?

11:35.480 --> 11:36.709
You know, it doesn't matter.

11:36.840 --> 11:39.071
I-I'm actually not sure
that the timing is right,

11:39.160 --> 11:40.958
and I really just want to focus
on team Flash

11:41.040 --> 11:42.952
and stopping Cicada.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.952
Yeah, but...

11:45.040 --> 11:46.793
Oh, hold on.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.234
Hey.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.993
Slow down, slow down.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.878
It's Sherloque.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.599
Nora did what?

11:54.520 --> 11:56.159
Why would Nora go in alone?

11:56.240 --> 11:57.754
And why isn't she out yet?

11:57.840 --> 11:59.920
My working theory is that
Grace's unique brain damage

11:59.960 --> 12:01.633
has caused her brain
to act defensively,

12:01.720 --> 12:03.313
so when it sensed
an outside presence,

12:03.400 --> 12:05.000
it moved all of its
neural nexus pathways

12:05.080 --> 12:08.391
to seal the exits like
a-a quarantine procedure.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.199
Grace's brain thinks
Nora's a pathogen.

12:10.280 --> 12:13.318
Yes, we can expect its
synaptic defense mechanisms

12:13.400 --> 12:16.120
to try and eliminate her.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.800
Remember I told you about
the Mad Hatter?

12:17.840 --> 12:20.435
He was also brain damaged,
so after my dispute with

12:20.520 --> 12:23.115
Watsune and my fourth wife,
Watsune pursued the case

12:23.200 --> 12:25.317
on his own
until the day I found him

12:25.400 --> 12:29.280
hooked up to the
<i>Machine à Mémoire</i> brain-dead.

12:29.360 --> 12:30.635
You knew this was
a possibility?

12:30.720 --> 12:31.949
What happened to easy peasy?

12:32.040 --> 12:35.636
That's why I say go in
in pairs.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.473
Barry, we have to go in
after her.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.559
I looked all over CCPD.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.233
There's no sign of the portal.

12:46.320 --> 12:47.896
<i>How could you have looked
everywhere?</i>

12:47.920 --> 12:49.832
You were gone for about
two seconds.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.639
Well, I'm really fast.

12:51.720 --> 12:54.474
<i>I-I used to run track
in high school.</i>

12:54.560 --> 12:56.677
Go CC Squirrels.

12:56.760 --> 12:59.355
Look, Grace, is there anywhere
else you can take me?

12:59.440 --> 13:01.591
Another memory?

13:12.680 --> 13:14.319
Where are we?

13:14.400 --> 13:15.959
My house.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.195
Uncle Orlin!

13:27.280 --> 13:29.192
Hey!

13:29.280 --> 13:31.954
Aww. Hey, kiddo.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.151
<i>How you doing?
How was your day?</i>

13:35.440 --> 13:36.840
<i>Let me run through
this again.</i>

13:36.960 --> 13:43.070
So Mr. Truck, you said.
You've seen Cicada here?

13:43.160 --> 13:45.755
Dude's been up in here like
a mean fungus.

13:45.840 --> 13:49.356
I see, and how is
the White Russian Hacker?

13:49.440 --> 13:51.397
You wanna focus up here?

13:51.480 --> 13:55.554
So can you tell me,
was he violent?

13:55.640 --> 13:57.518
Hell yeah, every Thursday,

13:57.600 --> 14:00.877
comes in and assaults
anyone in here.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.914
Unnecessary.

14:07.320 --> 14:09.551
But okay.

14:11.800 --> 14:15.680
<i>♪♪ Running, screaming ♪♪</i>

14:15.760 --> 14:20.471
<i>♪♪ The bad clubs in sin ♪♪</i>

14:20.560 --> 14:24.031
<i>♪♪ Ten feet of terror ♪♪</i>

14:29.800 --> 14:34.158
You're talking about
a band named "Sickada"?

14:34.240 --> 14:35.356
Yeah, bro.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.591
You said "that dude"
assaulted people.

14:37.680 --> 14:40.832
He assaults everyone in here
with that terrible music.

14:40.920 --> 14:41.920
Dibs.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.696
Well, that didn't pan out
the way that I hoped.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.313
We will have two
Mother-In-Laws, please.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.596
No, no, no, no. Truck,
thank you for your time.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.353
- I think we're done here.
- One drink.

14:49.440 --> 14:52.000
I'm paying.

14:52.080 --> 14:53.878
One drink,
but only because

14:53.960 --> 14:56.270
you never pay for anything ever
and I'm really curious

14:56.360 --> 14:59.034
to see what hell looks like
frozen over.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.632
We can't warn her
we're coming?

15:02.720 --> 15:05.076
We wanted to install
an emergency beacon,

15:05.160 --> 15:06.160
but it didn't work.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.436
So once you enter,
it'll create a new portal.

15:08.520 --> 15:11.274
You'll only have a few moments
to find Grace and Nora

15:11.360 --> 15:14.159
before Grace's brain tries
to seal it off.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.960
Remember,
if you die in there...

15:17.040 --> 15:21.751
We die out here.
I remember from DeVoe.

15:21.840 --> 15:24.912
We're gonna save her,
I promise.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.879
<i>Commencing
brainwave transmission.</i>

15:29.640 --> 15:31.597
Good luck.

15:39.160 --> 15:41.038
CCPD.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.711
All right, come on.

15:50.920 --> 15:53.480
<i>We found her hiding in
the last car under the seat.</i>

15:53.560 --> 15:55.358
- And her parents?
- No idea.

15:55.440 --> 15:57.193
She was on the Red Line
headed downtown.

15:57.280 --> 15:59.431
Must've jumped the turnstile
at Fourth and Waid.

15:59.560 --> 16:02.951
We can't just let her sleep
on this bench.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.157
Oh, my God. Barry.

16:05.240 --> 16:06.435
Wait, is that...?

16:06.520 --> 16:08.239
Is that Joe West's
granddaughter?

16:08.360 --> 16:10.511
<i>Nora? Hey, Nora.</i>

16:10.600 --> 16:12.512
<i>Someone get her.</i>

16:13.040 --> 16:14.872
I don't think we're
in Grace's memories.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.189
We're in Nora's.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.155
There's been no changes
in Grace's brain activity.

16:27.240 --> 16:28.560
But look.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.472
<i>Nora's brain activity
has tripled.</i>

16:30.560 --> 16:31.960
That means...

16:32.040 --> 16:35.317
Barry and Iris are
in Nora's memories.

16:35.400 --> 16:38.154
How did we end up in Nora's
childhood memories?

16:38.240 --> 16:40.038
I have no idea.
I also have no clue

16:40.120 --> 16:43.591
how we're gonna rescue Nora
from here.

16:43.680 --> 16:47.560
Okay. Okay, we're in a memory
within a memory, right?

16:47.640 --> 16:48.640
Yeah.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.359
So if we went through
a portal, then...

16:50.440 --> 16:52.477
It should take us into Grace.

16:53.520 --> 16:56.160
Okay, yeah, we just have to
wander through Nora's memories

16:56.240 --> 16:58.118
until we find where
the portal went.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.874
Okay.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.917
Maybe she'll lead us
right there.

17:05.960 --> 17:08.236
Whoa.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.753
What happened here?

17:09.880 --> 17:12.759
I guess in Nora's future,
S.T.A.R. Labs is...

17:12.839 --> 17:15.150
- The Flash Museum.
- The Flash Museum.

17:15.240 --> 17:19.200
No way.

17:19.280 --> 17:20.999
Look at this.

17:21.079 --> 17:25.074
Flash toys and Flash phones.

17:25.160 --> 17:29.837
Flash rings.
Are you kidding? Wow.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.718
This is all gonna go
to your head, isn't it?

17:31.800 --> 17:34.395
Oh, you know what?
It looks like it might.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.199
Oh, that is very cute.

17:39.480 --> 17:41.358
Hey, I found her.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.676
You think we can talk to her?

17:45.760 --> 17:47.991
No. I wish.

17:48.080 --> 17:51.596
This might be the only time
I get to see her at this age.

17:52.560 --> 17:53.976
Nora's consciousness
isn't here, though.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.639
It's in Grace.
This is a fixed memory.

17:55.760 --> 17:57.479
We can't interfere.

18:00.560 --> 18:03.314
When I was ten, I wasn't
running away from home.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.176
That's 'cause you were
a good kid.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.600
I ran away all the time.

18:06.680 --> 18:09.559
Yeah, only 'cause you were
trying to see your dad.

18:09.640 --> 18:11.791
Not 'cause you were running
from someone.

18:16.600 --> 18:20.230
Oh, hey, we should keep trying
to find the portal.

18:24.920 --> 18:27.116
Come on, Gracie, no cussing.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.237
Please, can we, please?

18:29.320 --> 18:31.277
Okay, fine.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.671
A rare, old bird is a pelican
whose beak can hold more

18:34.800 --> 18:36.120
than his belly can.

18:36.200 --> 18:39.398
He can hold in his beak
enough food for a week.

18:39.480 --> 18:42.200
But I'm darned if I know
how the hell he can.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.800
Grace, I was thinking maybe
we could go now

18:46.880 --> 18:48.917
and look for the portal?

18:50.280 --> 18:51.555
Is something burning?

18:51.640 --> 18:52.994
Oh, crap.

18:53.080 --> 18:55.754
I mean, crud.

18:55.840 --> 18:57.877
He thinks he takes
care of me now,

18:57.960 --> 18:59.792
but I really take care of him.

19:02.920 --> 19:05.355
<i>Okay, kiddo,
you better eat up.</i>

19:05.440 --> 19:07.477
<i>We've got a big day.</i>

19:07.560 --> 19:08.880
This is...

19:09.000 --> 19:11.356
<i>First we're going
to the zoo...</i>

19:11.440 --> 19:13.432
<i>This is an interesting
doll house.</i>

19:13.520 --> 19:15.352
<i>We're gonna get
ice cream, and then...</i>

19:15.440 --> 19:17.272
Can't forget the fair.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.317
Fair?

19:19.400 --> 19:21.232
Where you got hurt.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.516
Grace, I-I think that's where
the portal is.

19:23.640 --> 19:24.790
Can you take me there?

19:24.880 --> 19:26.792
To the last place
that you remember?

19:28.160 --> 19:29.799
Okay.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.072
Hey, check her out.

19:35.160 --> 19:37.629
She's right up your alley.
You should buy her a drink.

19:37.720 --> 19:40.280
Damn.
Look at that hand stitching.

19:40.360 --> 19:44.798
No, no, I did not come here
to admire jackets.

19:44.880 --> 19:47.554
I came here to vibe
an informant.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.154
Is it just me
or are there a lot

19:49.240 --> 19:51.800
of ladies in leather in here?

19:51.880 --> 19:54.076
Yep, singles night.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.914
It's quite a coincidence.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.514
Is it?

19:58.600 --> 20:00.796
What is it
you're always saying?

20:00.880 --> 20:04.271
- "I smell a mystery"?
- That is trademarked.

20:04.360 --> 20:06.955
I can vibe the anxiety coming
off of you right now.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.157
This whole thing was a setup.

20:09.240 --> 20:12.711
Of course your informant
didn't know Cicada.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.439
I mean, he knew of Cicada.

20:14.520 --> 20:17.399
You lied to me,
you wasted my time

20:17.480 --> 20:19.517
so I could be your wingman
tonight?

20:19.600 --> 20:21.114
No, no, no, dude,
it's not like that.

20:21.240 --> 20:23.550
You know, just when I think
you're growing up,

20:23.640 --> 20:25.393
you go ahead and do something
that shows me

20:25.480 --> 20:27.278
you're just as selfish
as the day we met.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.272
That's for the drinks.

20:29.360 --> 20:31.397
Excuse me.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.560
<i>Wait.</i>

20:37.960 --> 20:40.395
These guys get their own wing?

20:40.480 --> 20:43.120
<i>Who is Cicada?
Officials believe...</i>

20:43.200 --> 20:45.096
Barry, maybe we should keep
looking for the portal.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.520
Yeah.

20:46.640 --> 20:49.280
<i>But when Cicada resurfaced
in 2024</i>

20:49.360 --> 20:51.955
<i>after the Flash vanished,
some were left to speculate</i>

20:52.040 --> 20:54.396
<i>that Cicada is not a man
at all,</i>

20:54.520 --> 20:56.557
<i>but an immortal monster.</i>

20:56.640 --> 20:59.439
<i>All we know for sure
is his body count,</i>

20:59.520 --> 21:02.354
<i>152 victims and rising.</i>

21:02.440 --> 21:04.750
Wait, what?

21:04.840 --> 21:08.356
I knew we never caught Cicada,
but he never stops killing?

21:08.440 --> 21:11.080
<i>Flash did everything
he could,</i>

21:11.160 --> 21:13.720
<i>but Cicada killed more people
than Zoom</i>

21:13.800 --> 21:16.031
<i>or even the Red Death.</i>

21:16.120 --> 21:20.399
<i>And the way the city saw
the Flash, his legacy...</i>

21:21.400 --> 21:23.232
<i>it was never the same.</i>

21:24.720 --> 21:28.634
Nora West-Allen, you are in
serious trouble, young lady.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.160
Grace, what are we
doing here?

21:33.240 --> 21:35.038
You wanted to go
to my last memory.

21:35.120 --> 21:37.715
Yeah, but I thought that was
supposed to be at the fair.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.517
Grace?

21:42.600 --> 21:44.478
Hello?

21:44.560 --> 21:47.234
<i>The destructive phenomenon
emanated from a satellite</i>

21:47.320 --> 21:50.313
<i>that had fallen into
a decaying orbit.</i>

21:50.400 --> 21:51.800
<i>Thankfully,
before the satellite</i>

21:51.880 --> 21:54.315
<i>could strike the city...</i>

21:54.400 --> 21:55.993
How does she remember this?

21:56.080 --> 21:57.594
<i>A catastrophic event...</i>

21:57.680 --> 22:00.320
<i>A new meta was last seen
jumping off a building</i>

22:00.400 --> 22:02.119
<i>in order to evade capture
after...</i>

22:05.800 --> 22:07.792
<i>I'm gonna
make this right, Gracie.</i>

22:07.880 --> 22:12.079
Every meta will die.

22:17.120 --> 22:19.635
Grace, how did you hear Orlin
that night?

22:19.720 --> 22:22.235
- You were in a coma.
- I know.

22:22.360 --> 22:24.158
But I've been listening.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.800
<i>- You have to stop.
- Not until I'm finished.</i>

22:29.880 --> 22:31.234
Did they come after
you tonight?

22:31.320 --> 22:34.199
I killed his partner, Vibe,

22:34.280 --> 22:36.158
<i>but there was
a woman there too,</i>

22:36.240 --> 22:38.152
banged me up pretty bad.

22:38.240 --> 22:39.959
<i>She had speed.</i>

22:40.640 --> 22:43.474
I think she's
the Flash's daughter.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.836
Grace, I don't know
what you think Orlin said...

22:48.920 --> 22:50.832
You said you looked
everywhere.

22:50.920 --> 22:53.435
I get it now.
You have speed.

22:53.520 --> 22:55.398
<i>You're her, aren't you?</i>

22:55.480 --> 22:57.358
You're the Flash's daughter.

22:57.440 --> 22:59.716
You're the one
who hurt my uncle.

23:06.840 --> 23:08.593
Grace, I want to help you.

23:09.760 --> 23:12.719
No, you don't.
Uncle Orlin told me about you.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.837
You and your dad
are trying to hurt him.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.230
Only because he's trying
to hurt other people,

23:17.320 --> 23:18.595
innocent people!

23:20.360 --> 23:21.794
No, he only hurts metas,

23:21.920 --> 23:23.991
like the one who killed
my parents.

23:24.080 --> 23:27.278
Like you!
You're a meta and a liar!

23:27.360 --> 23:28.680
All metas aren't bad.

23:30.920 --> 23:33.958
My uncle is a hero.
He protects people,

23:34.040 --> 23:36.475
and I protect my uncle!

23:39.440 --> 23:42.194
My speed's gone.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.336
<i>Did you think that
you could run away</i>

23:53.360 --> 23:54.816
<i>and I wouldn't figure out
where you went?</i>

23:54.840 --> 23:56.136
It's my job to find out
the truth.

23:56.160 --> 23:57.958
- I'm a reporter.
- You're always a reporter.

23:58.080 --> 23:59.833
Why not be my mom for once?

23:59.920 --> 24:01.877
Oh, yeah?
How's this for being your mom?

24:02.000 --> 24:03.376
You are never coming back
to this place again.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.039
Let's go.

24:05.120 --> 24:07.077
Excuse me,
what is in your pocket?

24:07.160 --> 24:08.992
- Hand that over right now.
- It's not yours.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.800
Well, it is now. There are
consequences to your actions.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.712
Hand it over.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.480
I hate you.

24:20.320 --> 24:22.630
Leave it.
Let's go.

24:25.960 --> 24:28.839
Iris, that wasn't you.

24:31.480 --> 24:34.598
Yeah, but it will be, Barry.

24:35.400 --> 24:36.776
Nora's gonna grow up
hating her mother.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.917
No, she won't. You're gonna
make different choices.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.037
If you don't wanna be that
person that we just saw,

24:41.120 --> 24:42.440
- don't be that person.
- I know.

24:42.520 --> 24:43.776
I know you keep saying that,
Barry,

24:43.800 --> 24:45.439
and that's what I'm trying
to do.

24:45.520 --> 24:47.318
I had a moment today
and I thought that

24:47.400 --> 24:49.357
maybe if I could change
the timeline now,

24:49.440 --> 24:50.874
that even in the smallest way

24:50.960 --> 24:52.553
that... I don't know.

24:52.640 --> 24:55.712
That everything in the future
would be somehow different.

24:55.800 --> 24:58.918
This is why you changed
your mind about the newspaper.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.719
When I talked to the lawyer,

25:00.800 --> 25:04.111
I asked her to check
a dozen potential names,

25:04.200 --> 25:06.476
and guess which one
was the only one that cleared.

25:06.560 --> 25:08.631
The "Central City Citizen."

25:08.720 --> 25:10.632
I know it's got baggage,
but it's just a name.

25:10.720 --> 25:13.110
Is it? I mean, we've been
looking at that front page

25:13.240 --> 25:14.594
for four years.

25:14.680 --> 25:18.071
"Flash Missing,
Vanishes in Crisis."

25:18.200 --> 25:21.238
And I'm the one that writes
that article, Barry.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.754
I just thought that,
I don't know,

25:22.840 --> 25:24.016
maybe if I don't start
the paper, that...

25:24.040 --> 25:25.872
Iris, this is your dream,

25:26.000 --> 25:27.559
and the city needs
somebody like you.

25:27.640 --> 25:29.279
Yeah, but, Barry,
look where it gets us.

25:29.360 --> 25:32.319
These are Nora's memories
right now in this timeline

25:32.400 --> 25:34.392
after she interfered.

25:36.520 --> 25:39.354
Let's keep looking
for the portal, okay?

25:39.440 --> 25:41.477
Nora needs our help.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.079
I'll have whatever
he's having.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.431
All I want to order right now
is a Lyft out of here,

26:01.520 --> 26:04.115
but I get no bars in this bar,

26:04.200 --> 26:06.296
so maybe I'll just have to
leave the old-fashioned way

26:06.320 --> 26:07.549
and breach on out of here.

26:07.640 --> 26:10.155
Look, Cisco, I'm...

26:12.360 --> 26:13.919
Sorry I lied to you.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.354
Don't apologize to me.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.080
Apologize to all
the meta-humans out there

26:17.120 --> 26:18.839
still waiting for a cure,

26:18.920 --> 26:21.674
for their right to choose if
they want these powers or not.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.710
Before I was
The Elongated Man,

26:24.800 --> 26:28.191
when I was just nobody
Ralph Dibny,

26:28.280 --> 26:30.840
I could do whatever I wanted
whenever I wanted,

26:30.920 --> 26:34.118
but I didn't have any friends
to do those things with.

26:35.800 --> 26:38.872
So I just thought if, uh,
we're getting a night off

26:38.960 --> 26:41.077
from stopping Cicada,
we could just

26:41.200 --> 26:43.635
go out and...

26:43.720 --> 26:45.279
have some fun, you know?

26:45.360 --> 26:47.477
And I want that too,

26:47.560 --> 26:51.110
but after we figure out
this cure.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.679
You know,
my mom's friend Doug,

26:54.760 --> 26:56.479
he had a saying.

26:56.560 --> 26:58.313
"If you're always waiting
to live your life,

26:58.400 --> 26:59.914
you're gonna die
before it starts."

27:00.000 --> 27:04.597
And Doug, he would know.
He operated a Zamboni.

27:04.680 --> 27:06.353
May he rest in peace.

27:06.440 --> 27:08.079
All right,
I'ma go outside,

27:08.160 --> 27:09.536
see if I can stretch
my arm high enough

27:09.560 --> 27:12.314
to get you some
cell phone service.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.031
Dark and Stormy
on the house.

27:20.200 --> 27:21.554
Do I look that pathetic?

27:21.640 --> 27:23.996
You look like you belong here
about as much as I do.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.237
Thought I was coming here
for a business meeting.

27:26.320 --> 27:28.391
What do you do,
sell leather?

27:28.480 --> 27:30.597
- Nope.
- Tattoo artist.

27:30.680 --> 27:32.319
- Mm-mm.
- Gun for hire.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.632
Trust me.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.518
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

27:37.600 --> 27:38.920
Well,
I'm a photographer,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.276
so it looks like we're both
a little lost.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.760
So what's your excuse?

27:42.840 --> 27:45.275
Taking pictures hasn't made
me rich, yet,

27:45.360 --> 27:47.113
so I bartend to pay rent.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.600
My sister hooked me up here.

27:48.680 --> 27:50.751
Forgot to mention
I'd be working in hell.

27:52.560 --> 27:54.677
Sisters.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.832
If I looked at the DNA
of two siblings,

27:57.920 --> 28:00.276
one who became a meta
and one who didn't,

28:00.360 --> 28:02.352
I would have a close enough
genetic match

28:02.440 --> 28:03.794
to isolate the part
of the genome

28:03.880 --> 28:05.678
that controls meta-genes.

28:07.080 --> 28:09.436
I'm sorry,
did I just say that out loud?

28:09.520 --> 28:11.477
Yeah, you did.

28:11.560 --> 28:15.315
I-I just... that... I...

28:15.400 --> 28:17.357
- Cisco.
- Kamilla.

28:17.440 --> 28:20.274
<i>- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.</i>

28:20.360 --> 28:21.874
I can't find the portal
anywhere.

28:21.960 --> 28:25.795
I can't even get out of Nora's
memories of this one day.

28:25.880 --> 28:27.280
Barry, get down!

28:41.440 --> 28:43.716
Nora's in trouble.
Grace's defense mechanisms

28:43.800 --> 28:45.075
must be attacking her.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.919
She's not the only one
who's in trouble.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.536
<i>We need to get them
out of there now.</i>

28:50.360 --> 28:52.272
It's Nora's
defense mechanism.

29:07.720 --> 29:09.951
What am I supposed to do now?

29:18.200 --> 29:19.475
Hello?

29:19.560 --> 29:21.552
- Nora, is that you?
<i>- Caitlyn!</i>

29:21.640 --> 29:23.154
Yes, I told you
the M.A.D. 2.0

29:23.280 --> 29:25.078
could complete
your emergency beacon.

29:25.200 --> 29:27.040
Uh, Nora, your parents
went into your memories.

29:27.080 --> 29:28.309
<i>Uh, let me conference them in.</i>

29:28.400 --> 29:30.995
Sorry, my parents went where?

29:47.000 --> 29:48.992
- Iris West-Allan.
- Mom? Dad?

29:49.080 --> 29:50.958
- Nora, are you okay?
<i>- So listen.</i>

29:51.040 --> 29:52.896
- We made an important discovery.
<i>- To get you out of there.</i>

29:52.920 --> 29:55.992
The portals are hidden
in perception gaps.

29:56.080 --> 29:58.470
Things that you remember
the way you want them to be,

29:58.560 --> 29:59.914
not the way they actually were.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.256
<i>'Cause you're in denial
or your perception</i>

30:01.280 --> 30:03.317
<i>was colored by anger
or what have you.</i>

30:03.400 --> 30:05.681
So these defense mechanisms,
they're composed of synapses.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.360
If you can break down the
synapses in the false memory,

30:08.440 --> 30:10.159
<i>that will reveal
the real memory</i>

30:10.240 --> 30:12.835
and the synaptic jolt
will expose the portal.

30:12.920 --> 30:15.560
Okay, so... okay, well,
how do we do that?

30:15.640 --> 30:18.155
Well, uh,
we'll have to call you back.

30:18.240 --> 30:19.310
You're burning up.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.917
Hello?

30:27.400 --> 30:29.437
Perception gaps.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.394
The dollhouse.

30:36.040 --> 30:38.714
How do we know which memories
weren't real?

30:39.480 --> 30:42.791
Of course... Iris,
it's the Hall of Villains.

30:42.880 --> 30:43.880
You and Nora.

30:43.960 --> 30:46.270
Barry, I still dampen
Nora's power.

30:46.360 --> 30:48.033
She still grows up hating me.

30:48.120 --> 30:50.589
- This is my future.
- No, no, it's not.

30:50.680 --> 30:52.831
It's just a memory,
one warped from the perspective

30:52.920 --> 30:55.116
of a sad, angry, little kid
that ran away from home.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.510
Don't you get it? That person
that we saw in there,

30:57.600 --> 30:59.796
the bad mom
that Nora told us about,

30:59.880 --> 31:02.918
she doesn't even exist
in any timeline.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.276
<i>I told you you had to be
different in the future,</i>

31:05.360 --> 31:06.360
but I was wrong.

31:06.440 --> 31:07.999
You don't have to change
who you are.

31:08.080 --> 31:11.232
You don't even have to change
the name of your newspaper.

31:11.320 --> 31:15.234
I know any future with you
in it is gonna be a good one.

31:15.320 --> 31:18.677
You just gotta believe
that too.

31:20.760 --> 31:22.558
What are you doing here?

31:22.640 --> 31:24.791
Please,
this memory isn't real.

31:24.880 --> 31:28.317
Your uncle's house, I don't
think it's really like this.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.119
Okay, better eat up, kiddo.

31:30.240 --> 31:31.240
We got a big day...

31:34.320 --> 31:35.390
Grace, get down!

31:46.160 --> 31:48.038
I don't see
the portal anywhere.

32:00.720 --> 32:02.439
Barry, it's working!

32:10.520 --> 32:12.557
Death. Failure.

32:12.640 --> 32:15.951
Another broken family.

32:16.040 --> 32:20.432
<i>This is the legacy I gave you.</i>

32:22.360 --> 32:24.716
Nobody breaks up my family,
you son of a bitch.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.236
Oh, no.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.957
You dropped your toy.

33:10.040 --> 33:12.157
I just wanted to see
the museum.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.480
I know, honey,
but you ran away.

33:13.560 --> 33:14.914
I didn't know where you went.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.560
I was afraid you could have
gotten hurt.

33:16.600 --> 33:18.876
You said that the museum
reminded you of Dad

33:18.960 --> 33:21.634
<i>'cause Dad was the Flash's
number one fan.</i>

33:21.720 --> 33:24.189
So I wanted to see it

33:24.280 --> 33:28.320
'cause I love the Flash too.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.477
It's not fair.

33:30.560 --> 33:33.871
I know, honey.
I know it's not fair.

33:33.960 --> 33:36.031
I love you, Nora.

33:36.120 --> 33:38.191
<i>Your dad loved you too.</i>

33:38.280 --> 33:40.511
<i>So, so much.</i>

33:43.400 --> 33:44.914
Come here, girl.

33:53.200 --> 33:55.237
<i>Come on. We gotta go.</i>

33:57.680 --> 33:59.512
<i>Let's go get Nora.</i>

33:59.640 --> 34:03.077
Grace, I know you're afraid.

34:03.160 --> 34:05.160
You think that you'll never
be as happy as you were

34:05.200 --> 34:06.395
that day with your uncle.

34:06.520 --> 34:09.672
That's why you try to remember
it as perfect,

34:09.760 --> 34:13.150
but things can be
that good, Grace.

34:13.239 --> 34:17.029
You just have to wake up.

34:18.960 --> 34:21.998
And then you and me
and my parents,

34:22.120 --> 34:24.679
we can all help
your uncle together.

34:26.480 --> 34:28.710
You're a liar.

34:40.360 --> 34:42.317
Grace.

34:42.400 --> 34:44.835
Maybe you don't have anyone
who cares about you,

34:44.920 --> 34:47.674
<i>but I have someone
who cares about me,</i>

34:47.760 --> 34:51.389
and I'm the only one
who can help him.

34:57.560 --> 34:58.994
Mom.

34:59.080 --> 35:01.151
- Hey.
- She's not coming.

35:01.240 --> 35:02.913
- What?
- Hurry!

35:03.000 --> 35:04.070
Come on. Come on.

35:14.760 --> 35:17.116
They're okay.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.120
Neural oscillations
are normal.

35:33.200 --> 35:34.440
You three are
perfectly healthy.

35:34.520 --> 35:35.776
Oh, and we think
we've figured out

35:35.800 --> 35:37.393
how you two ended up
in Nora's brain.

35:37.480 --> 35:39.790
<i>That is a satellite shard</i>

35:39.880 --> 35:42.270
full of dark matter
in Grace's head.

35:42.360 --> 35:43.396
<i>Mon dieu.</i>

35:43.480 --> 35:45.597
<i>Sometimes surgeons
leave a piece of shrapnel</i>

35:45.680 --> 35:48.559
in a patient's brain if
it's too dangerous to remove,

35:48.640 --> 35:50.416
<i>and we think that the dark
matter was seeping out</i>

35:50.440 --> 35:52.591
to create a barrier around
her brain.

35:52.680 --> 35:55.036
We can't go back in
as long as it's there.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.120
It's too dangerous.

35:56.200 --> 35:58.590
Well, we need to find another
way to stop Cicada.

35:58.680 --> 36:01.752
I think I might be able
to help with that.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.119
It's the inside
of Dwyer's house.

36:10.200 --> 36:11.475
<i>Whoa.</i>

36:11.560 --> 36:12.656
- Damn.
<i>- I mean, that's great.</i>

36:12.680 --> 36:14.399
But why did you go in
without us?

36:14.480 --> 36:15.630
<i>We had a plan.</i>

36:15.720 --> 36:18.155
No, I know, um...

36:18.240 --> 36:20.391
You know, just with the machine
being ready

36:20.480 --> 36:22.358
and knowing that Cicada
was still out there

36:22.440 --> 36:25.877
I guess I just, um,
I got a little excessive.

36:25.960 --> 36:29.192
It's not the only reason,
though, right?

36:29.280 --> 36:32.239
It was protecting her secret.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.516
What secret is that?

36:44.880 --> 36:47.600
Well, her feelings for her
mother when she was a child.

36:47.680 --> 36:49.478
Must be painful memories.

36:52.400 --> 36:53.720
Is that correct, Nora?

36:53.800 --> 36:55.314
Yeah, exactly.

36:57.440 --> 37:00.592
Okay, um, let's get started
on this lead.

37:00.680 --> 37:01.909
Good job, Nora.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.434
Thanks.

37:07.640 --> 37:11.429
Monsieur Allen, just for my
records for today's events,

37:11.520 --> 37:16.834
what was the defense mechanism
Nora was using?

37:16.960 --> 37:19.953
It was one of the costumes
from the museum.

37:20.040 --> 37:22.191
What costume?

37:22.280 --> 37:24.272
The Reverse Flash.

37:42.720 --> 37:43.836
<i>Surprise!</i>

37:43.920 --> 37:45.991
Happy first day
in your new office.

37:46.080 --> 37:47.355
You're so sweet.

37:49.120 --> 37:51.396
So have you decided what
you're gonna name the paper?

37:51.480 --> 37:53.119
I don't know.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.795
"Central City Citizen"
has a certain ring to it.

37:55.880 --> 37:59.191
- You sure?
- Yeah, you were right.

37:59.280 --> 38:01.158
Future isn't always
what it seems.

38:01.240 --> 38:02.993
<i>We decide what it gets to be.</i>

38:03.080 --> 38:05.914
So, um, I just have to
tell you one little thing.

38:07.800 --> 38:09.280
See that ledger down there?

38:09.360 --> 38:12.353
That's the year the paper
was founded in my time.

38:12.440 --> 38:13.874
2021.

38:15.400 --> 38:16.595
That's two years from now.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.957
You're changing
the future already.

38:22.240 --> 38:24.880
Hey, um, I gotta find Cisco,

38:24.960 --> 38:26.838
but I'll see you guys later,
all right?

38:26.920 --> 38:28.274
Okay.

38:30.240 --> 38:31.993
Let's head back.

38:34.280 --> 38:36.078
- Mom?
- Yeah?

38:36.160 --> 38:40.234
Dad told me about the memory
that you saw.

38:40.320 --> 38:43.631
I know it wasn't real, Nora,

38:43.720 --> 38:46.519
but it must have come
from a very real place.

38:46.600 --> 38:50.150
You must have been so angry
with me to see me that way.

38:50.240 --> 38:53.153
I was angry all the time.

38:53.240 --> 38:55.755
Angry for not getting
to have a dad,

38:55.840 --> 39:00.915
angry 'cause nobody seemed to
understand what I was feeling.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.913
And it didn't matter
what you did or said, Mom.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.959
I was always gonna be angry
at you...

39:07.040 --> 39:09.680
because you were there.

39:09.760 --> 39:11.752
You were going through
a lot, Nora.

39:11.840 --> 39:14.071
But so were you.

39:14.160 --> 39:15.336
I mean, I thought
you were trying

39:15.360 --> 39:16.874
to stop me from being me,

39:16.960 --> 39:19.475
but you were trying to stop me
from being Dad.

39:19.560 --> 39:22.997
I mean, ending up like him.

39:23.080 --> 39:26.198
You guys had a whole
life together

39:26.280 --> 39:29.751
and a child,
and he vanished.

39:29.840 --> 39:35.120
I-I can't imagine how hard
that must have been for you.

39:35.200 --> 39:37.840
And from that day, you...

39:37.920 --> 39:39.559
you were protecting me.

39:39.640 --> 39:42.394
I-I get that now.

39:43.920 --> 39:46.594
So sorry for the way
that I treated you,

39:46.680 --> 39:51.630
both back then and now
when I first got here.

39:51.720 --> 39:53.200
You didn't deserve that.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.874
Thank you.

40:01.680 --> 40:05.560
You're an amazing woman,
Nora West-Allen.

40:05.640 --> 40:08.235
I will always love you,

40:08.320 --> 40:10.039
past, present, and future.

40:10.120 --> 40:12.589
I love you too, Mom.

40:12.720 --> 40:15.280
<i>It's hard to keep
a secret, but it's a lot easier</i>

40:15.360 --> 40:16.816
<i>when you're reminded
why you're doing it.</i>

40:16.840 --> 40:17.840
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

40:17.920 --> 40:18.920
- Okay.
- Okay.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.720
<i>I met someone who told me
that she would do anything</i>

40:21.800 --> 40:23.598
<i>to protect her family.</i>

40:24.520 --> 40:29.800
She helped me see
that... so would I.

40:30.480 --> 40:34.474
My parents can't know that
you're helping me stop Cicada.

40:34.560 --> 40:36.836
There's too much at risk.

40:36.920 --> 40:40.357
And I'll do anything
to protect them.

40:41.240 --> 40:43.516
Even lie.

40:48.440 --> 40:50.113
<i>Liar.</i>

40:50.200 --> 40:51.634
<i>Liar.</i>

40:51.760 --> 40:55.071
<i>Liar. Liar.</i>

40:55.160 --> 40:57.595
Nora lied to me.

40:59.600 --> 41:00.716
She'll pay.

41:02.640 --> 41:04.438
They'll all pay.

41:10.120 --> 41:11.839
Doug was right.

41:11.920 --> 41:14.230
Going out there,
doing the ice skating thing,

41:14.320 --> 41:16.312
that was definitely
the right thing to do.

41:16.400 --> 41:19.279
Yeah, all Doug,
may he rest in peace.

41:19.360 --> 41:21.431
Let's pour one out
for the guy.

41:21.520 --> 41:23.159
Kamilla?
The bartender?

41:23.240 --> 41:26.153
- Uh, excuse me.
- Dude, nice.

41:26.240 --> 41:27.799
- All right, all right.
- Yeah.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.718
Hey, did you guys
make a breakthrough

41:29.840 --> 41:30.990
with the meta-human cure?

41:31.080 --> 41:33.515
We did.
I managed to locate

41:33.600 --> 41:35.592
a pair
of meta-non-meta siblings,

41:35.720 --> 41:38.918
so this cure,
it's as good as done.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.754
All right, good,
because I've been thinking.

41:43.880 --> 41:45.872
I want to use the cure
on Cicada.

42:12.640 --> 42:14.074
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
