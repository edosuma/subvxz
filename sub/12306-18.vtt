00:00.430 --> 00:01.829
Previously on "stalker"...

00:01.830 --> 00:04.299
Beth: Ray matthews
was just released.

00:04.300 --> 00:05.529
He's targeting my life.

00:05.530 --> 00:06.429
He wants michelle back.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.692
Ray: We have to make
her vulnerable,

00:07.700 --> 00:10.032
Take away her family
here in [.A.

00:10.040 --> 00:11.667
I'm being relieved
of my command.

00:11.670 --> 00:13.308
Jack: So who's
in charge now?

00:13.310 --> 00:15.301
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

00:15.310 --> 00:17.369
I'm trying really
hard to give you

00:17.380 --> 00:18.609
The benefit
of the doubt.

00:18.610 --> 00:19.805
Beth: Tracy,
where are you?

00:19.820 --> 00:20.639
Ray:
Hello, michelle.

00:20.650 --> 00:22.118
Perry: What are you
gonna do to her?

00:22.120 --> 00:23.542
She's gonna bring
me michelle.

00:23.550 --> 00:25.279
Run, run!

00:25.290 --> 00:28.055
Vicky: Ben, I want you
to escort beth home.

00:28.060 --> 00:29.209
Take a unit
with you.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.324
Jack: No sign
of ray or perry.

00:31.330 --> 00:32.286
We found tracy.

00:32.290 --> 00:33.724
Where's beth?
She's home.

00:33.730 --> 00:35.289
No. I heard him.
He wanted you to find me.

00:35.300 --> 00:36.950
That was his plan.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.166
This was
always a distraction.

00:39.170 --> 00:41.730
Ben? No! No!

00:46.410 --> 00:49.129
Aah! Aah!

00:51.980 --> 00:53.869
Weatherman: Chance of showers
through the night,

00:53.880 --> 00:56.645
But it should be cleared up
by morning,

00:56.650 --> 00:58.982
Paving the way
for blue skies.

00:58.990 --> 01:00.845
So get out your
fishing gear

01:00.860 --> 01:02.749
Because tomorrow
will be the day...

01:02.760 --> 01:05.855
[knock on door]

01:05.860 --> 01:07.589
[turns off tv]

01:09.600 --> 01:12.592
[rattling]

01:13.500 --> 01:16.037
Hello?

01:16.040 --> 01:18.099
Ray: Hello?

01:18.110 --> 01:20.738
Who's there?

01:20.740 --> 01:23.380
Uh, I hate
to bother you,

01:23.380 --> 01:26.600
But my car
broke down.

01:26.620 --> 01:29.544
Could--could I use
your phone?

01:29.550 --> 01:33.111
I--I saw that
your light's on.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.519
You know, I'm sure
you're busy,

01:34.520 --> 01:36.557
But, uh, if you
wouldn't mind,

01:36.560 --> 01:37.550
It would just take
a minute.

01:37.560 --> 01:39.528
Don't you have
a--a cell phone?

01:39.530 --> 01:43.626
I do, but I--I just--I can't
get service out here.

01:43.630 --> 01:45.564
Do--do you have
a phone?

01:45.570 --> 01:47.425
I only have
my cell phone.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.762
It's, uh, spotty
out here in the mountains.

01:50.770 --> 01:54.479
Yeah. You're
telling me.

01:54.480 --> 01:56.676
Can I try yours?

01:58.450 --> 02:00.077
How about, uh, I call
for you?

02:00.080 --> 02:02.378
Who do you-- who do
you want me to call?

02:02.380 --> 02:06.385
What was that? I
can't--I can't hear you.

02:06.390 --> 02:09.586
If you can just
open the door.

02:09.590 --> 02:11.149
It's awfully late.
I--I don't know

02:11.160 --> 02:14.824
If anything's gonna
be open now.

02:14.830 --> 02:16.252
I--what am I
gonna do?

02:16.270 --> 02:19.729
I--I got to try,
right?

02:19.740 --> 02:22.789
Sir, if--look. If you
could just open up,

02:22.810 --> 02:26.508
I'd really appreciate
it. Please.

02:43.190 --> 02:44.885
Uh, here.

02:46.530 --> 02:48.589
Thank you.

02:50.830 --> 02:51.763
It's a nice place.

02:51.770 --> 02:53.625
Uh, it's, uh--
it's not mine.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.995
I'm just renting it
for the month.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.933
You by yourself?

03:00.280 --> 03:02.374
Do you have
a signal?

03:02.380 --> 03:04.030
Uh...

03:07.550 --> 03:09.370
No.

03:13.520 --> 03:18.458
Hmm. Well, thanks
for letting me try.

03:20.630 --> 03:22.223
Unh!

03:24.670 --> 03:27.628
[grunting]

03:29.340 --> 03:32.640
[groaning]

03:32.640 --> 03:35.473
[grunting]

04:27.230 --> 04:30.951
Janice: The same. He hasn't
regained consciousness.

04:30.970 --> 04:32.460
But the surgery
was successful?

04:32.470 --> 04:33.960
They were able to
remove the bullet,

04:33.970 --> 04:36.940
But it nicked his subclavian
artery or something.

04:36.940 --> 04:38.430
Time, rest, who knows?

04:38.440 --> 04:40.067
Have you heard
anything about beth?

04:40.080 --> 04:42.572
Nothing. The search
went through the night.

04:42.580 --> 04:43.934
Roadblocks,
door to door.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.406
It's all over the news.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.139
Someone had to seen him.

04:47.150 --> 04:48.970
We're gonna find her.

04:48.980 --> 04:51.847
[cell phones vibrating]

04:52.590 --> 04:54.786
The fbi believes
that ray matthews

04:54.790 --> 04:55.757
Has crossed state lines,

04:55.760 --> 04:57.888
And they will now
be taking control

04:57.890 --> 04:59.119
Of this investigation.

04:59.130 --> 05:02.259
We will assist them
in anything that they need.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.330
Now to give us an update,

05:03.330 --> 05:05.890
Special agent in charge
bill wheeler.

05:05.900 --> 05:06.492
Bill.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.264
Thank you.
As you know,

05:08.270 --> 05:10.659
Every ounce of manpower
available is searching

05:10.670 --> 05:12.809
For lieutenant davis.

05:12.810 --> 05:14.266
Jack: So are we
sidelined or what?

05:14.280 --> 05:16.408
No, but it's kidnapping
and state lines,

05:16.410 --> 05:17.969
So it's
the fbi's case now.

05:17.980 --> 05:19.175
We'll work
alongside them.

05:19.180 --> 05:20.602
We don't know they
crossed state lines.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.076
The fbi has good
reason to believe

05:22.080 --> 05:23.741
That ray has crossed
back into washington state,

05:23.750 --> 05:26.788
But regardless, they have the
manpower and the resources.

05:26.790 --> 05:28.417
This is really
good news for beth.

05:28.420 --> 05:30.081
Now in the meantime,
I've been required

05:30.090 --> 05:32.457
To hand over your
case files and evidence

05:32.460 --> 05:33.985
To their task force
commander.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.627
Sounds like
sidelined to me.

05:35.630 --> 05:37.519
We don't need
that tone.

05:37.530 --> 05:39.168
I know that beth
matters, all right?

05:39.170 --> 05:41.593
Now right now, we can
focus on the psychology.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.467
We need to figure out
where ray took beth.

05:44.470 --> 05:45.801
There has to be
a trail

05:45.810 --> 05:47.107
Of bread crumbs
somewhere.

05:47.110 --> 05:48.600
The psychology of
abduction isn't complicated.

05:48.610 --> 05:50.009
It's all about power
and love.

05:50.010 --> 05:51.478
Once you have someone
within your possession,

05:51.480 --> 05:53.005
They rely on you
for everything,

05:53.020 --> 05:54.203
Including their lives.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.040
Well, ray's been
locked up for 12 years.

05:56.050 --> 05:58.212
He's had plenty of
time to meticulously

05:58.220 --> 05:59.312
Detail a plan.

05:59.320 --> 06:00.446
You mean,
their future together.

06:00.460 --> 06:03.111
Yes. His delusional
idea of their future.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.019
He'll want to isolate
her in captivity.

06:05.030 --> 06:07.453
Eventually, she'll
come to depend on him.

06:07.460 --> 06:08.291
The stockholm syndrome.

06:08.300 --> 06:09.449
Right. So he's
a psychopath

06:09.470 --> 06:11.495
'Who's been in
treatment for years.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.195
What if he believes
that he has been cured

06:13.200 --> 06:15.032
And that he could do
the same thing to beth?

06:15.040 --> 06:16.360
Brainwashing her?

06:16.370 --> 06:17.292
Mm-hmm.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.709
Conditioning her
into living him.

06:18.710 --> 06:20.508
Yeah. If that's the case,
beth will know it.

06:20.510 --> 06:23.730
She'll use his psychology
against him.

06:24.210 --> 06:27.248
News anchor, muffled: The victim
tau lieutenant beth davis

06:27.250 --> 06:29.810
And her likely abductor
ray matthews.

06:29.820 --> 06:31.914
Lieutenant davis was
taken from her home

06:31.920 --> 06:33.809
In los angeles last night.

06:33.820 --> 06:35.811
[clear audio] ray matthews,
who was recently released

06:35.820 --> 06:39.222
From seattle pacific
psychiatric hospital...

06:39.230 --> 06:42.052
Ray: Good morning.
How'd you sleep?

06:42.060 --> 06:44.427
A friend
of lieutenant davis--

06:49.200 --> 06:51.032
Egg whites,

06:51.040 --> 06:54.101
Tomatoes, no cheese.

06:54.110 --> 06:56.101
I remembered.

07:04.250 --> 07:08.118
I know you like more
veggies in your omelet,

07:08.120 --> 07:11.215
But it's not like I can
just rush out to the store.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.881
What happened to ben?

07:13.900 --> 07:15.026
Who?

07:15.030 --> 07:18.091
The detective you
shot at my house.

07:18.100 --> 07:26.008
Oh, the news says he's in
severe but stable condition.

07:34.780 --> 07:39.115
You don't trust me,
do you?

07:39.120 --> 07:41.111
It's not poisoned.

07:41.120 --> 07:44.249
You know I wouldn't do
that to you, right?

07:44.260 --> 07:46.957
You knocked me out
and put me in the trunk

07:46.960 --> 07:48.086
With a dead body.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.158
I'm sorry about that,

07:49.160 --> 07:51.595
But your friend tracy,
she's ok.

07:51.600 --> 07:55.298
You know, you could
thank me for that.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.667
Why did you
kill perry?

07:57.670 --> 08:00.503
Perry became
a liability.

08:00.510 --> 08:02.330
How many others,
ray?

08:02.340 --> 08:03.569
[sighs]

08:03.580 --> 08:07.073
The end justifies
the means.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.172
What is the end?

08:08.180 --> 08:10.171
Do you even know?

08:10.190 --> 08:13.444
You and me together

08:13.460 --> 08:17.090
Like it's always been.

08:17.090 --> 08:18.956
Salt.

08:18.960 --> 08:20.359
You need help.

08:20.360 --> 08:27.369
Yeah. I suffer from
narcissistic personality disorder.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.803
I'm well aware of it.

08:31.810 --> 08:35.030
You can turn this
all around, ray.

08:35.980 --> 08:37.630
Come on. Let me go.

08:37.650 --> 08:40.176
Take these
handcuffs off.

08:41.450 --> 08:44.147
Think I might wait till
you trust me a little more.

08:44.150 --> 08:47.780
I am never going to
trust you.

08:47.790 --> 08:53.320
I've waited 12 years
to be with you,

08:53.330 --> 08:57.028
And I realize I may
have to wait 12 more years

08:57.030 --> 08:59.624
For you to
trust me again,

08:59.640 --> 09:02.359
For you to love me,

09:02.370 --> 09:05.305
I mean, I think if--if
we've established anything

09:05.310 --> 09:09.429
It's that I'm patient.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.201
Wouldn't you agree?

09:19.050 --> 09:21.087
Yeah.

09:21.090 --> 09:22.751
Yeah.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.867
I'm a little hungry
actually.

09:34.870 --> 09:37.066
Well, good.

09:37.070 --> 09:39.607
This is getting cold.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.673
Oh. Napkin.

09:46.680 --> 09:48.671
Unh!

10:11.910 --> 10:13.605
[gasps]

10:18.410 --> 10:21.050
Unh! Ugh!

10:29.320 --> 10:31.084
News anchor: A nationwide
manhunt is underway,

10:31.090 --> 10:34.481
Who took control
of the the investigation

10:34.500 --> 10:35.490
Earlier today.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.457
Janice: It's 3,000 pages
of notes, files,

10:37.470 --> 10:40.622
Medical records, 128
hours of video sessions

10:40.640 --> 10:42.495
With ray and his doctor.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.298
I'm starting
in the notes,

10:44.310 --> 10:46.631
And you can take
the video sessions.

10:46.640 --> 10:48.631
Got it.

10:50.510 --> 10:51.500
Hey.

10:51.510 --> 10:54.150
Move your ass.

10:54.150 --> 10:55.413
You know
the statistics.

10:55.420 --> 10:56.512
We have 48 hours.

10:56.520 --> 10:58.249
The chance of finding
her is less than 50%.

10:58.250 --> 11:00.116
This is a waste
of time.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.350
We could be doing more.

11:02.360 --> 11:03.680
Who is this vicky woman,

11:03.690 --> 11:05.328
And why is she
in charge?

11:05.330 --> 11:07.480
Is that where
you're taking this?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.025
No, I just--
then shut up.

11:09.030 --> 11:10.156
We need to find
beth.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.424
Nothing else
matters, got it?

11:14.670 --> 11:16.331
Ray: If you weren't
so feisty,

11:16.340 --> 11:17.830
I wouldn't have
to do this.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.934
Ray, the man
who lives here--

11:19.940 --> 11:22.671
I saw him.
You killed him.

11:22.680 --> 11:25.445
I put him
in the closet.

11:25.450 --> 11:27.043
This has gone
too far.

11:27.050 --> 11:29.769
I'm gonna get you
some water.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.918
You need to stay
hydrated.

11:38.130 --> 11:41.179
[water running]

11:56.580 --> 12:00.505
I--I know you think
I'm a horrible person,

12:00.520 --> 12:02.375
And maybe I am,

12:02.380 --> 12:04.974
But I don't
have to be.

12:04.990 --> 12:10.087
You have the power
to change me.

12:10.090 --> 12:13.526
How do I do that?

12:13.530 --> 12:15.726
By forgiving me.

12:19.730 --> 12:21.562
Michelle, I'm sorry
for what I did

12:21.570 --> 12:25.359
To your sister
and your family,

12:25.370 --> 12:28.408
For setting that fire.

12:28.410 --> 12:33.177
I never meant
for anyone to die.

12:33.180 --> 12:37.640
It was a stunt
to impress you.

12:38.920 --> 12:42.709
I was gonna run in, and I
was gonna save everybody,

12:42.720 --> 12:45.758
And--and the fire
spread so fast,

12:45.760 --> 12:48.286
It went out
of control.

12:50.560 --> 12:55.339
Please forgive me.
Please.

12:57.140 --> 13:01.099
How am I supposed to
look past that?

13:03.640 --> 13:05.540
I'm sorry.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.173
See?

13:11.890 --> 13:16.919
How can I be so lost if I
know what I did was wrong?

13:16.930 --> 13:19.126
I'm not a psychopath.

13:19.130 --> 13:22.657
The psychopathic mind
knows no remorse.

13:22.660 --> 13:25.630
I'm guilt-ridden
for what I did to you,

13:25.630 --> 13:29.066
And I can be
a better man

13:29.070 --> 13:32.529
If you would believe
in me again.

13:34.510 --> 13:36.831
In time,

13:36.850 --> 13:39.410
You'll forgive me.

13:40.650 --> 13:42.914
Doctor on video: Tell me
why set the fire, ray.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.740
If I could just talk
to michelle myself,

13:44.750 --> 13:47.242
I could--I could
explain to her.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.580
Explain to me, ray.

13:48.590 --> 13:49.989
Why did you
set the fire?

13:49.990 --> 13:52.925
Because I thought
I could control it.

13:52.930 --> 13:55.956
Is that important
to you, control?

13:55.960 --> 13:57.997
You don't understand.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.423
Doctor: Talk to me
about michelle.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.498
I'd much rather talk

14:01.500 --> 14:03.992
About my sheltered
and spoiled upbringing.

14:04.010 --> 14:07.002
You know, I thought we
were making a lot of progress.

14:07.010 --> 14:09.377
Do you still dream
about her?

14:09.380 --> 14:11.439
What does she do
in your dreams?

14:11.450 --> 14:13.009
She's crying mostly

14:13.010 --> 14:15.217
Because she
misses me.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.212
I got nothing.

14:19.220 --> 14:21.211
It's a psycho and
his greatest hits.

14:21.220 --> 14:23.359
Same here,
but ray's demeanor

14:23.360 --> 14:25.556
Did change dramatically
over the years.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.686
Twice weekly
therapy.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.350
And a steady regimen
of antipsychotics.

14:28.360 --> 14:30.897
He's taken every
antipsychotic pill that exists

14:30.900 --> 14:31.992
At one time
or another.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.560
Except for now, he's
completely unmedicated.

14:34.570 --> 14:36.163
He's unbalanced.

14:36.170 --> 14:37.296
He killed that
private eye,

14:37.310 --> 14:39.199
Bashed his head in
over and over again.

14:39.210 --> 14:41.201
Have you been able to
contact his psychiatrist?

14:41.210 --> 14:42.302
He should be on call.

14:42.310 --> 14:43.709
I left a message
at the hospital.

14:43.710 --> 14:48.307
He's on his way to
munich for a conference.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.675
You want some good news?

14:50.690 --> 14:52.715
I'd kill for some.

14:52.720 --> 14:53.846
Ben's awake.

14:53.860 --> 14:56.158
He's weak,
but he's awake.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.412
Vital signs are good.

14:57.430 --> 15:00.422
He's gonna make
a full recovery.

15:01.430 --> 15:06.300
Ray: Do you remember
the high school trip to d.C.?

15:07.170 --> 15:09.093
Oh, the bus ride
that took forever,

15:09.100 --> 15:11.694
And then we only had one
day to see 10 museums.

15:11.710 --> 15:13.667
Well, and I wanted to
go to the space museum,

15:13.680 --> 15:16.331
But all that you
cared about was seeing

15:16.340 --> 15:17.375
The inaugural gowns.

15:17.380 --> 15:20.042
That's not true.
I wanted to see

15:20.050 --> 15:21.279
The declaration
of independence.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.578
No. We skipped that,
and we went to georgetown,

15:23.590 --> 15:26.241
And we found
the "exorcist" steps,

15:26.250 --> 15:27.513
And I let you push
me down them,

15:27.520 --> 15:29.181
And we reenacted the
last scene in the movie.

15:29.190 --> 15:31.215
Right, and everyone
thought we were crazy.

15:31.230 --> 15:33.119
Well, I mean, we're not
the only ones who ever took

15:33.130 --> 15:36.020
A tumble
down those steps.

15:52.280 --> 15:55.944
Maybe it's not
too late for us.

15:58.450 --> 16:02.114
You know, I was hoping
you would say that.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.214
[pops can open]

16:17.300 --> 16:19.200
Ohh.

16:23.410 --> 16:29.076
You're good, michelle,
but not that good.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.174
I'm sorry.

16:31.190 --> 16:32.646
I'm just cold.

16:32.650 --> 16:35.085
Why don't we build
a fire?

16:46.300 --> 16:49.531
Ray: I'm gonna prove
myself to you.

16:49.540 --> 16:52.202
You'll see.

16:52.210 --> 16:55.771
Things can be the way
that they used to be.

17:24.910 --> 17:26.662
Ohh!

17:26.670 --> 17:29.935
Oh, no. No, no.

17:50.030 --> 17:53.330
Janice, come
look at this!

17:55.500 --> 17:58.162
That's very beautiful.

17:58.170 --> 18:00.537
Doctor: Yes, it is.
Very serene.

18:00.540 --> 18:04.909
I--I like the calm--
calm of nature.

18:06.050 --> 18:08.940
Ray's staring at the wall
behind the doctor's head.

18:08.950 --> 18:10.247
Yeah. Some kind
of photograph?

18:10.250 --> 18:12.241
Yeah, but he asks
about it over 9 times.

18:12.250 --> 18:13.843
Does the doctor
every answer?

18:13.860 --> 18:16.852
Is there-- is there any
update on the doctor?

18:16.860 --> 18:18.180
Can--can we ask him?

18:18.190 --> 18:21.285
I can't reach him!

18:21.300 --> 18:23.598
That's all I got.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.762
Hey. I'm doing
worse.

18:25.770 --> 18:27.659
I'm...

18:30.940 --> 18:31.862
He's killed now,

18:31.870 --> 18:33.634
And it's only
gonna escalate.

18:33.640 --> 18:35.734
He wants michelle,
not beth,

18:35.740 --> 18:39.278
If he realizes that he
can't have michelle, he--

18:39.280 --> 18:42.443
Seriously, is this where
you're taking this?

18:42.450 --> 18:46.944
Tears? Blow your nose,
get back to work.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.542
Heh.

18:53.960 --> 18:57.726
Ray: They've got |.A.
Locked down tight.

18:57.730 --> 19:02.236
They have no idea
where we are.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.334
[knock on door]

19:18.990 --> 19:20.242
Who is it?

19:20.260 --> 19:21.341
Hazel down the road.

19:21.360 --> 19:25.251
Introduce myself,
see if you need anything.

19:25.260 --> 19:26.989
You make a sound,

19:27.000 --> 19:30.459
I'm gonna kill her,
you understand?

19:30.470 --> 19:32.598
Just one sec.

19:43.980 --> 19:46.301
No one else
has to die, ray.

19:46.310 --> 19:49.280
Ray!
That's up to you.

19:49.280 --> 19:52.250
If you so much
as cough...

19:55.160 --> 19:56.685
You must be
peter daniels.

19:56.690 --> 19:59.455
Hazel schwartz. I
look after the place.

19:59.460 --> 20:01.280
They usually call me to
bring out the welcome wagon.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.621
I've baked some cookies
for you, chocolate chip.

20:03.630 --> 20:05.223
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

20:05.230 --> 20:07.722
Oh, just a little
personal touch.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.993
I know all the best,
uh, hiking trails.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.061
I'm happy to show
you around.

20:13.070 --> 20:14.401
If you need
something,

20:14.410 --> 20:17.300
Some wood or some
more cookies-- ha ha--

20:17.310 --> 20:19.369
I'm just a half-mile
up the road.

20:19.380 --> 20:22.315
Number 40. Name's
on the mailbox.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.015
It's very nice
of you.

20:24.020 --> 20:26.341
Well, enjoy your
stay, mr. Daniels.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.647
If solitude's
your thing,

20:27.660 --> 20:29.253
You came
to the right place.

20:29.260 --> 20:31.183
Thank you.

20:31.190 --> 20:33.557
[door opens and shuts]

20:35.060 --> 20:36.721
Phew.

20:40.570 --> 20:43.767
That wasn't
so hard, was it?

20:44.440 --> 20:48.434
I knew my michelle
was in there somewhere.

20:51.850 --> 20:54.148
She left her scarf.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.009
Forget about it, ray.
She's gone.

20:57.020 --> 20:58.840
No. I got to go give
it back to her.

20:58.850 --> 21:00.887
I can't risk her
coming back.

21:00.890 --> 21:02.187
You said if I did
what you wanted

21:02.190 --> 21:03.351
You wouldn't hurt her.

21:03.360 --> 21:05.454
And I won't.

21:05.460 --> 21:08.953
You can trust me,
michelle.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.826
All right.

21:37.260 --> 21:39.388
[branch snaps]

21:41.500 --> 21:44.891
Ohh! Mr. Daniels.

21:44.900 --> 21:46.220
You dropped this.
Thank you.

21:46.230 --> 21:47.561
I didn't even miss it.

21:47.570 --> 21:48.423
How sweet.

21:48.440 --> 21:51.592
I'm so sorry,
but I can't risk you

21:51.610 --> 21:54.261
Going home and
turning on your tv.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.429
Excuse me?

21:55.440 --> 21:56.475
Ohh! Go--

21:56.480 --> 22:00.178
Aah! No, no, no, no!

22:00.180 --> 22:03.571
No! Aah! Aah!

22:03.580 --> 22:06.311
[grunting]

22:13.430 --> 22:15.250
Ohh!

22:37.620 --> 22:38.473
[locks door]

22:38.490 --> 22:41.642
What did you do, ray?

22:41.660 --> 22:43.412
Nothing.

22:47.490 --> 22:48.480
I found something.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.729
Did you talk
to ray's doctor?

22:49.730 --> 22:50.959
No, but I started
googling him,

22:50.970 --> 22:52.222
And I found this
article written

22:52.230 --> 22:53.368
About dr. Jacobs
last year.

22:53.370 --> 22:54.565
That's his office
in the photo.

22:54.570 --> 22:56.038
Where the interviews
with ray were conducted.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.530
From where he sat,
I bet that's

22:57.540 --> 22:58.689
The photograph that ray
kept referencing.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.303
You think he's trying
to get to that place?

23:00.310 --> 23:01.505
Think about it.
He was looking at it

23:01.510 --> 23:03.137
Every time he was
talking about michelle.

23:03.140 --> 23:06.701
It's possible that it became
part of his obsession with her.

23:06.710 --> 23:10.647
You're grasping,
jack.

23:10.650 --> 23:12.880
Of course I am.

23:15.020 --> 23:16.681
Isolate the picture,
crop and zoom.

23:16.690 --> 23:19.580
Let's--let's do
an image search.

23:21.560 --> 23:23.198
Send it to ben's
computer.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.429
He has the nsa
retrieval engine.

23:24.430 --> 23:27.070
It's the most
comprehensive.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.375
Wait, wait, wait.
Go--go back.

23:39.380 --> 23:40.939
Right there.
What's that?

23:40.950 --> 23:42.577
Gps data
from the matching image

23:42.580 --> 23:45.447
Should tell us
where it was taken.

23:46.690 --> 23:49.557
Only this section of the
valley has that particular view.

23:49.560 --> 23:50.857
Address puts us
at the corner

23:50.860 --> 23:51.884
Of white oak
and juniper.

23:51.890 --> 23:53.255
Can you run
a property title search

23:53.260 --> 23:54.386
Within a two-mile
radius?

23:54.400 --> 23:55.720
It's all woods up there,

23:55.730 --> 23:57.528
Cabins, second homes,
a perfect place to hide.

23:57.530 --> 24:00.397
There's 26
properties listed.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.697
Oh, my god.
What?

24:01.700 --> 24:04.738
Dr. Phillip jacobs.
32 sagebrush lane.

24:04.740 --> 24:06.560
We could have a county
sheriff do a drive-by.

24:06.570 --> 24:09.369
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You think that's smart?

24:09.380 --> 24:11.030
A couple yokels
showing up at his door?

24:11.050 --> 24:12.973
It could be a christopher
dorner situation.

24:12.980 --> 24:14.209
It could explode.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.040
What are you
suggesting?

24:16.050 --> 24:17.916
We could be there
before dark.

24:17.920 --> 24:19.069
Well, let's talk
to vicky.

24:19.090 --> 24:20.649
No. She'll only
consider it a long shot.

24:20.660 --> 24:21.616
It is a long shot.

24:21.620 --> 24:23.088
She'll do
the same thing.

24:23.090 --> 24:23.989
She'll call ojai,

24:23.990 --> 24:25.412
And they'll send
a deputy.

24:25.430 --> 24:27.057
We go instead. We find
anything, we give a call.

24:27.060 --> 24:28.619
We don't have--
if ray feels threatened,

24:28.630 --> 24:32.419
Half of all stalker - abductions
end in murder-suicides.

24:32.430 --> 24:34.364
It's beth.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.466
Let's go.

24:43.640 --> 24:46.302
Ray: I don't think we
should risk new mexico.

24:46.310 --> 24:49.678
We're only 5 hours
from tijuana.

24:49.680 --> 24:54.117
After we get to mexico,
what do we do?

24:54.120 --> 24:57.055
Well, we further
into baja.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.588
Are you
feeling better?

25:05.300 --> 25:08.861
I'm so sorry
about the old lady.

25:10.600 --> 25:15.766
Tijuana is the busiest
border crossing in the world.

25:15.780 --> 25:18.340
What about mexicali?

25:21.620 --> 25:24.817
Mexicali? Here.

25:24.820 --> 25:27.517
Yeah. We could take
back roads.

25:27.520 --> 25:30.490
There's less people,
so there's fewer chances

25:30.490 --> 25:32.549
Of getting stopped
by law enforcement.

25:32.560 --> 25:35.086
I know
you're playing me.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.525
Am I?

25:39.530 --> 25:40.691
I will do whatever
you want

25:40.700 --> 25:44.489
So that no one else
gets hurt.

25:44.510 --> 25:45.909
If that means going
to mexico with you

25:45.910 --> 25:49.574
And turning into whatever
it is that you want me to be,

25:49.580 --> 25:53.505
Then that's what it is.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.274
Fair enough.

25:59.820 --> 26:02.687
I'm gonna check out
the other car,

26:02.690 --> 26:06.388
See if we can't use it
to get across the border,

26:06.390 --> 26:08.154
And we'll go
by night.

26:08.160 --> 26:11.460
You know,
fewer people.

26:31.790 --> 26:34.589
I knew I couldn't
trust you.

26:36.760 --> 26:39.684
But to what degree?

26:39.690 --> 26:41.784
That was
the question.

26:46.470 --> 26:48.290
Unh!

26:48.300 --> 26:51.031
[grunting]

26:59.880 --> 27:01.848
Ohh!

27:03.880 --> 27:04.870
Aah!

27:04.890 --> 27:06.483
Unh!

27:10.420 --> 27:12.013
Ohh!

27:14.060 --> 27:15.824
Aah!

27:21.840 --> 27:23.729
Aah! Aah!

27:23.740 --> 27:25.629
Stop, stop.

27:25.640 --> 27:28.063
Michelle, stop, ok?

27:28.080 --> 27:30.640
Ok.

27:30.650 --> 27:32.436
Please.
Ok.

27:32.450 --> 27:34.748
Please.
Ok.

27:34.750 --> 27:38.072
Unh! Ohh!

27:38.090 --> 27:39.842
Errgh!

27:39.850 --> 27:43.150
Aah! Aah!

28:14.820 --> 28:15.810
Whoa!

28:15.820 --> 28:16.890
What's going on?

28:16.890 --> 28:18.779
Is this the home
of dr. Phillip jacobs?

28:18.790 --> 28:20.121
He's my dad. Why?

28:20.130 --> 28:21.859
The neighbors
complain?

28:21.860 --> 28:23.123
Dr. Jacobs' son.

28:23.130 --> 28:24.450
Yeah. He's out of
town, so I brought

28:24.470 --> 28:25.892
My girlfriend
and some friends up

28:25.900 --> 28:27.026
For some after
midterm r&r.

28:27.030 --> 28:29.169
When's the last time
you spoke to your father?

28:29.170 --> 28:31.059
Uh, a couple
of days a go.

28:31.070 --> 28:32.299
He's out
of the country.

28:32.310 --> 28:33.960
Have you seen
this man?

28:33.970 --> 28:36.905
He's a former patient of your
father's. You may not be safe here.

28:36.910 --> 28:38.878
I suggest you pack up your
friends and get out of here.

28:38.880 --> 28:39.904
I'll turn
the music dow--

28:39.910 --> 28:42.811
Actually, it's not
a suggestion.

28:42.820 --> 28:44.879
Yeah. OKk.

28:47.920 --> 28:50.287
This tire track.

28:52.030 --> 28:53.555
Wonder if ray
was here,

28:53.560 --> 28:55.551
Pulled off to the
side of the road.

28:55.560 --> 28:58.257
He was watching
the house.

29:01.070 --> 29:02.890
This is the view
from the picture.

29:02.900 --> 29:04.436
When he saw the
house full of college kids,

29:04.440 --> 29:06.329
He pulled back
onto the road.

29:06.340 --> 29:08.536
Looks like he pulled
off in this direction.

29:08.540 --> 29:09.837
What is that north?

29:09.840 --> 29:10.875
Yeah.

29:10.880 --> 29:13.577
He wouldn't abandon
hs fantasy so easily.

29:13.580 --> 29:16.003
No. He'd find
another house.

29:16.020 --> 29:18.739
[panting]

29:24.560 --> 29:26.153
Ohh!

29:40.210 --> 29:44.033
There's too many
properties down this way.

29:44.040 --> 29:48.045
Wait. Look.
One mailbox.

29:48.980 --> 29:51.176
Isolated.

30:28.620 --> 30:30.418
They're unlocked.

30:30.420 --> 30:32.309
She got free.

30:36.030 --> 30:39.056
And it looks like
she kicked his ass.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.207
[cell phone ringing]

30:46.210 --> 30:49.032
We found them.
They're in ojai in a cabin.

30:49.040 --> 30:49.973
Address?

30:49.980 --> 30:50.833
26 old creek road.

30:50.850 --> 30:52.136
Looks like beth
freed herself,

30:52.150 --> 30:54.039
And maybe ray chased
her into the woods.

30:54.050 --> 30:56.610
We're pinpointing
your location.

30:57.280 --> 31:00.682
The task force, hrt,
and swat are en route.

31:00.690 --> 31:03.011
I don't know,
but if he sees us coming,

31:03.020 --> 31:05.057
There's no telling
what he might do.

31:05.060 --> 31:08.724
Jack, beth's safe return
is all that we are after,

31:08.730 --> 31:11.153
Do you
understand me?

31:11.170 --> 31:14.299
Yeah. Keep you posted.

31:14.300 --> 31:17.531
All right. How fast can you
get that chopper up there?

31:17.540 --> 31:18.792
Let's go.

31:18.810 --> 31:20.960
It's getting dark.

31:20.980 --> 31:23.301
Let's split up
and surround him.

31:38.390 --> 31:41.382
[panting]

31:52.070 --> 31:54.038
Janice, you
got anything?

31:54.040 --> 31:55.769
Janice on radio:
Nothing.

31:55.780 --> 31:57.669
Copy.

32:05.420 --> 32:07.616
[leaves rustling]

32:07.620 --> 32:10.920
[footsteps]

32:12.230 --> 32:15.256
[breathing heavily]

32:15.260 --> 32:16.921
[whimpers]

32:25.970 --> 32:28.530
[rocks and dirt clattering]

32:33.780 --> 32:35.043
Beth.

32:35.050 --> 32:37.519
Jack. Jack.

32:40.550 --> 32:42.279
Oh, god.

32:42.290 --> 32:45.658
Oh, god.
Are you ok?

32:45.660 --> 32:48.925
[sobbing]

32:48.930 --> 32:50.056
Where's ray?

32:50.060 --> 32:54.361
He--he's after me.
He has my gun.

32:55.970 --> 32:57.836
You've been shot.

32:57.840 --> 33:00.434
We need to take
care of that.

33:00.440 --> 33:02.408
Come on. Janice,
I found beth.

33:02.410 --> 33:04.629
Jack on radio:
She's been shot.

33:04.650 --> 33:05.833
How bad is it?

33:05.850 --> 33:07.500
She's bleeding.

33:07.510 --> 33:11.071
There's a cabin about 100
yards east of our position.

33:11.090 --> 33:12.478
We'll meet
you there.

33:12.490 --> 33:13.639
Copy that.

33:13.650 --> 33:15.914
[ray whistles]

33:30.600 --> 33:32.136
[knocks on door]

33:32.140 --> 33:34.165
Police!

33:42.520 --> 33:44.272
Police!

33:46.390 --> 33:48.347
Here. Sit down here.

34:03.970 --> 34:05.836
I'll take a look.

34:05.840 --> 34:08.036
You're lucky the bullet
just grazed your thigh.

34:08.040 --> 34:11.829
Now I just need
something to clean it up.

34:11.850 --> 34:15.775
Hey. Thanks
for coming for me.

34:17.520 --> 34:19.443
You're welcome.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.024
You're in luck.

34:30.030 --> 34:32.397
I found
a first-aid kit.

34:39.340 --> 34:41.069
Surprise.

34:43.610 --> 34:46.306
[sirens]

34:56.420 --> 34:57.717
Vicky: OK. This is
where we stand.

34:57.720 --> 35:01.679
We have 3 officers,
one of them possibly injured,

35:01.700 --> 35:03.589
And one suspect.

35:03.600 --> 35:04.749
Set a perimeter.

35:04.770 --> 35:05.851
No one gets through.

35:05.870 --> 35:08.191
I want two-man teams
to spread out

35:08.200 --> 35:11.534
And search every inch
of these woods.

35:11.540 --> 35:14.305
Stay alert,
stay careful.

35:14.310 --> 35:17.280
[indistinct chatter]

35:20.810 --> 35:23.040
You want to be the hero.

35:23.050 --> 35:26.213
You got that look.

35:26.220 --> 35:27.449
Jack: No.

35:27.450 --> 35:29.214
No hero here.

35:29.220 --> 35:30.551
Good. Take out your weapon

35:30.560 --> 35:32.688
And put it
on the ground.

35:35.460 --> 35:37.121
Now!

35:44.640 --> 35:46.335
Slowly.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.139
Kick it over here.

35:55.450 --> 35:57.043
Unh!

36:17.770 --> 36:19.829
Very good.

36:24.110 --> 36:26.374
Man: Agent gregg.

36:26.380 --> 36:28.405
We have a body.

36:36.560 --> 36:39.257
Get a coroner down here.

36:50.540 --> 36:52.065
Tie her tight.

36:52.070 --> 36:53.299
It's no use, ray.

36:53.310 --> 36:54.709
I called in
our location.

36:54.710 --> 36:56.804
Cops are
on their way.

36:57.640 --> 36:58.801
Ray, what are you
planning?

36:58.810 --> 37:01.848
Seems our little trip
to mexico is off,

37:01.850 --> 37:03.818
And I've got to
improvise,

37:03.820 --> 37:05.811
Thanks to you.

37:12.890 --> 37:14.824
Ray, the best thing
for you to do right now

37:14.830 --> 37:16.150
Is turn yourself in.

37:16.160 --> 37:19.653
Yeah. I'm pretty sure
that's a bad idea,

37:19.670 --> 37:21.866
But I've got
a better plan.

37:21.870 --> 37:23.861
Which is?

37:23.870 --> 37:26.532
A tragedy, I'm afraid.

37:26.540 --> 37:29.362
Classic tale
of boy meets girl,

37:29.380 --> 37:30.905
Boy loses girl,

37:30.910 --> 37:32.935
Boy goes postal
and burns down the house.

37:32.950 --> 37:33.906
No, ray. Ray!

37:33.910 --> 37:36.618
I recognize how full
circle this is for you

37:36.620 --> 37:39.442
And how thematic
it is.

37:48.130 --> 37:50.121
Aah!

37:50.130 --> 37:53.862
We didn't make it
in this lifetime, michelle.

37:55.370 --> 37:57.862
Maybe the next.

37:57.870 --> 37:58.940
[flicks lighter]

37:58.940 --> 38:01.910
Ray, no!
Ray, please!

38:01.910 --> 38:02.934
Ray!

38:02.940 --> 38:04.772
Unh!

38:04.780 --> 38:06.874
[gunshot]

38:06.880 --> 38:08.473
Where'd that shot
come from?

38:08.480 --> 38:10.141
Man on radio:
Straight up ahead, ma'am.

38:10.150 --> 38:12.972
Come on. Everyone,
this way!

38:12.990 --> 38:14.480
[coughing]

38:14.490 --> 38:17.209
[grunting]

38:30.270 --> 38:32.534
No!

38:35.980 --> 38:38.472
[coughing]

38:42.920 --> 38:45.673
[coughing]

39:00.330 --> 39:03.197
[jack coughing]

39:08.970 --> 39:10.438
[radio chatter]

39:10.440 --> 39:12.499
Beth! Detective
larsen is still inside!

39:12.510 --> 39:15.002
Go now!
Yes, ma'am!

39:15.020 --> 39:16.203
Secure the perimeter.

39:16.220 --> 39:17.540
Cover the back,
the sides.

39:17.550 --> 39:19.871
Make sure he does not
get away!

39:19.890 --> 39:22.882
[man shouting orders]

39:25.160 --> 39:28.186
[coughing]

39:29.900 --> 39:30.822
Jack.

39:30.830 --> 39:32.457
Man: Hold on!

39:35.030 --> 39:36.623
Ohh!

39:38.200 --> 39:41.409
Vicky: We need paramedics
in here right now!

39:41.410 --> 39:44.710
Are you ok?
Yeah.

39:44.710 --> 39:45.506
[coughs]

39:45.510 --> 39:46.306
Man: Agent gregg,

39:46.310 --> 39:47.641
There's still
a body in there.

39:47.650 --> 39:49.869
We couldn't get
to him.

39:55.320 --> 39:58.858
Woman: give me time

39:58.860 --> 40:04.060
to realize my crime

40:40.370 --> 40:46.230
do you really
want to hurt me?

40:46.240 --> 40:49.130
[coughing]

40:49.140 --> 40:52.371
The paramedics took her
to a local emergency room

40:52.380 --> 40:55.577
To stitch her up,
but she's gonna be ok.

40:55.580 --> 40:59.141
Sorry about racing
off without telling you.

40:59.150 --> 41:00.640
Well, it all worked out
in the end,

41:00.650 --> 41:04.257
So I'd say
let it slide.

41:04.260 --> 41:05.216
One thing.

41:05.230 --> 41:07.426
How'd you get help
here so quickly

41:07.430 --> 41:10.559
Unless you knew
where we were?

41:10.560 --> 41:12.722
You tracked us?

41:12.730 --> 41:15.119
I had a little help
on standby just in case

41:15.140 --> 41:16.722
It was needed.

41:16.740 --> 41:19.664
Look. It was obvious
that you care for beth,

41:19.670 --> 41:21.604
So you were
my best move.

41:21.610 --> 41:25.774
I knew you wouldn't
stop till you found her.

41:25.780 --> 41:27.999
Thank you.

41:28.010 --> 41:33.449
Do you really want
to make me cry?

41:33.450 --> 41:39.412
Precious kisses,
words that burn me

41:39.430 --> 41:43.924
lovers never
ask you why

41:45.200 --> 41:47.123
Beth.

41:47.130 --> 41:49.064
Don't move, please.

41:51.540 --> 41:53.634
What--what happened
to you?

41:53.640 --> 41:56.063
It's such a long story.

41:57.980 --> 42:01.473
Ben, I'm so sorry.

42:01.480 --> 42:03.847
What about ray?

42:03.850 --> 42:05.716
Please tell me
you got him.

42:05.720 --> 42:07.848
Yeah, we got him.

42:12.960 --> 42:14.883
So it's over.

42:18.130 --> 42:20.292
It's over.

42:26.870 --> 42:32.070
Do you really
want to hurt me?
