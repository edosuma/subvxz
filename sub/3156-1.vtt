00:44.277 --> 00:46.178
Hey, old man, you look at me.

00:47.080 --> 00:50.148
I got something to say to you.

00:50.150 --> 00:52.050
Every time we land someplace new,

00:52.052 --> 00:54.986
you say it's gonna be
different, but it ain't.

01:00.493 --> 01:03.929
You mess up a lot,
then you leave a mess

01:03.931 --> 01:06.598
for me and Mama and
Dorothy to clean up

01:06.600 --> 01:09.768
and that ain't right.
That's all I'm saying.

01:09.770 --> 01:12.237
Hell, I do what I gotta do.

01:12.239 --> 01:15.774
You do whatever the hell you want,
whatever you can get away with.

01:19.245 --> 01:22.948
You're just a selfish old drunk.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.218
Yeah, that's what you is.

01:29.722 --> 01:32.090
This place is gonna be after us.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.092
Hell, they'll be on you,

01:34.094 --> 01:36.828
and they're gonna beat your ass.

01:38.264 --> 01:41.600
And I hate to see you go down.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.835
I know you're my daddy.

01:46.539 --> 01:48.540
You know you sure are, ain't you?

01:48.542 --> 01:50.775
I'm talking at you.

01:59.185 --> 02:02.053
What you done this time,

02:02.055 --> 02:03.889
they'll beat your ass to shit.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.625
That's what they're gonna do.

02:08.693 --> 02:10.794
You can count on it.

03:36.282 --> 03:39.737
<i>Service but was looking at some
of the Doppler radar estimates</i>

03:39.763 --> 03:43.455
<i>and it looked as if close to
three inches of rain fell</i>

03:43.857 --> 03:46.157
<i>with a little
thunderstorm complex...</i>

04:01.140 --> 04:03.642
Round 'em up, Junior.

04:03.644 --> 04:07.045
- <i>Yo, it ain't lunchtime yet.
- Round 'em up.</i>

04:07.047 --> 04:08.880
<i>Let's pack up the gear, guys.</i>

04:08.882 --> 04:10.115
<i>Let's get out of here!</i>

04:23.295 --> 04:25.897
One at a time, one at a time.

04:25.899 --> 04:28.066
- Hey, hey, hey... one at a time.
- <i>I'm trying to get situated.</i>

04:28.068 --> 04:32.437
Go, go, go.

04:35.341 --> 04:38.443
Why y'all moving so slow? Looks like
y'all goddamn turtles out there.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.278
It's getting rained on!

04:51.824 --> 04:54.259
<i>Damn, Joe, when you gonna
get that new truck, Joe?</i>

04:54.261 --> 04:57.762
What's wrong with this one?

04:57.764 --> 04:59.898
It's raggedy. You can't
tell what's wrong with it?

04:59.900 --> 05:02.233
- You don't know?
- Yeah...

05:02.235 --> 05:05.036
- think I'd get another one.
- Damn right.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.839
Let me get a cigarette.

05:13.746 --> 05:15.914
I'm gonna have to start
taking this out of your pay.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.254
All right, then.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.156
See you tomorrow
if the sun comes up.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.025
<i>I'll holler at you in the morning.
Let me know.</i>

05:27.027 --> 05:28.993
All right.

05:30.229 --> 05:32.397
Which jersey now?
Pittsburgh yellow?

05:43.876 --> 05:45.844
<i>All right!</i>

06:28.320 --> 06:30.555
You can see the moisture
moving northward

06:30.557 --> 06:33.158
out of Mexico and also
out into the Gulf of Mexico,

06:33.160 --> 06:34.893
meeting up
with this frontal system,

06:34.895 --> 06:37.962
which is slowly being...
been sagging southward.

06:37.964 --> 06:40.532
As we look at temperatures
with the cloud cover,

06:40.534 --> 06:42.433
<i>not as hot as what
we've been seeing,</i>

06:42.435 --> 06:45.170
<i>but the cool-down isn't
related to Canadian air.</i>

06:45.172 --> 06:48.139
<i>Here's some Canadian air over the
northeastern part of the country.</i>

06:48.141 --> 06:50.275
<i>Very high dew points.</i>

06:50.277 --> 06:52.844
<i>This represents a whole lot
of moisture available to us</i>

06:52.846 --> 06:55.880
<i>and to those tall clouds
producing the heavy rains.</i>

06:55.882 --> 06:58.183
<i>So the showers and thunderstorms
during tonight...</i>

07:34.554 --> 07:37.088
- Morning, Junior.
- <i>Morning, Joe.</i>

07:37.090 --> 07:38.528
You going to work this morning?

07:38.554 --> 07:41.125
<i>Shit, Joe. If it's gonna rain,
call me. I'll show up.</i>

07:41.127 --> 07:43.027
What about Shorty?
He get drunk last night?

07:43.029 --> 07:45.597
- <i>Shorty almost got arrested last night.</i>
- What? He what?

07:45.599 --> 07:48.266
<i>- Hell, yeah.</i>

07:50.302 --> 07:53.338
All right. Yeah, I'll be up
at Coleman's in 30 minutes.

07:53.340 --> 07:57.208
- Y'all be ready.
- <i>Bye-bye!</i>

07:57.210 --> 07:58.576
Ooh, Shorty, that was
a rough night last night.

07:58.578 --> 08:00.645
Almost didn't make it
to work this morning, boy.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.548
- I heard some stories.
- You'd be surprised.

08:03.550 --> 08:06.150
Drinking and trying to touch
this lady on the butt.

08:15.628 --> 08:17.395
<i>Here's Joe, y'all.
Here's Joe.</i>

08:17.397 --> 08:19.198
Come on, Joe,
help a brother out, now.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.965
- Good morning, Joe.
- Morning.

08:20.967 --> 08:23.067
Y'all come go with me.

08:23.069 --> 08:24.335
- All right.
- Don't know why, either.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.204
Don't make no sense,
though, you know?

08:27.473 --> 08:29.340
- Morning, John.
- <i>Hello, Joe.</i>

08:29.342 --> 08:31.542
- <i>You want some coffee?</i>
<i>- No, I can get it.</i>

08:31.544 --> 08:35.446
It ain't cold, is it?
It was cold yesterday.

08:37.582 --> 08:40.018
<i>Now let's see, you're Bill, right?</i>

08:40.020 --> 08:41.352
I'm Shorty, he's Bill.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.655
- Where's Sammy today?
- Sammy gone fishing, Joe.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.924
Hell, Sammy told me you fired him.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.592
I fired his ass three
times already.

08:47.594 --> 08:49.527
You tell Sammy I'm gonna
fire him for good

08:49.529 --> 08:51.129
if he don't start
helping me out some.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.598
- Y'all want some coffee?
- Yeah, sure, man.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.467
- See that ball game last night?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

08:56.469 --> 08:58.703
Them boys played
one hell of a game.

08:58.705 --> 09:01.010
<i>- Who won, though?</i>
- We did, of course.

09:01.036 --> 09:03.608
- Shorty, you want some of these wieners?
- I'm good.

09:03.610 --> 09:06.110
Shorty, if you had one like this,
you'd be a bad boy, God damn.

09:06.112 --> 09:08.713
Uh-huh, whatever. You got
one of these right here.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.549
<i>That's a shriveled Slim Jim.</i>

09:11.551 --> 09:13.051
<i>Act like you ain't got
nothing to do today.</i>

09:13.053 --> 09:14.686
Y'all gonna quit pussyfooting
around me today.

09:14.688 --> 09:17.422
You gonna get some work
out of me, Junior.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.357
All right, you're gonna take
the east side over here.

09:19.359 --> 09:20.625
Take the east side over there.

09:20.627 --> 09:22.168
<i>- You all right?
- Yes, sir.</i>

09:22.194 --> 09:25.063
<i>I want you to take the west side
over here today, all right?</i>

09:25.065 --> 09:28.333
Why you looking at me like you retarded?
Get that thing on and go with him.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.969
- <i>Shorty, you all right today?
- Yeah, I'm good, man.</i>

09:30.971 --> 09:33.404
Feeling pretty good? You look
like a goddamn Ghostbuster today.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.074
You all right? You gonna
fight like one today?

09:36.076 --> 09:38.576
- You gonna work like one?
- I work well, my man.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.178
- Huh?
- I'm good.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.347
- All right, don't trip on it.
- Yeah.

09:42.349 --> 09:45.083
Huh? Yeah, you're gonna go bust
a move on me today, Shorty.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.518
Yeah, bust them trees.

11:59.852 --> 12:02.487
<i>A snake!</i>

12:03.522 --> 12:05.189
Better watch it there, man.

12:05.191 --> 12:07.592
I don't know. That
cottonmouth's pretty big.

12:07.594 --> 12:10.161
Look here.

12:11.430 --> 12:13.464
Look at that. Don't
know how big he is.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.399
- Watch it there!
- Watch it, watch it!

12:15.401 --> 12:18.469
- Watch it!
- Ooh!

12:18.471 --> 12:20.905
Hey, Junior.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.574
Whoo-hoo, that's a big one now!

12:23.576 --> 12:26.477
He can be known as the snake god.

12:31.750 --> 12:35.353
Joe, you got nuts of a bear, Joe.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.854
That's what that woman
told me last night...

12:36.856 --> 12:39.924
"I need another snake."
I've seen one today.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.727
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:46.332 --> 12:48.466
That's what that fat woman said.

12:51.537 --> 12:53.538
<i>We got company.</i>

12:57.242 --> 12:58.809
Let me see that snake.

13:00.579 --> 13:03.781
- Ain't he a nice one?
- Mm.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.317
See those fangs?

13:06.319 --> 13:08.853
You get bit by those,
you're gonna die.

13:08.855 --> 13:11.322
You're gonna wanna die.

13:11.324 --> 13:14.725
Y'all don't kill it.
It's my friend.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.360
- Whoa!
- Damn!

13:16.362 --> 13:17.962
<i>Almost throwed it over by me!</i>

13:17.964 --> 13:21.265
Get back to work, y'all.
The show is over with.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.801
- I heard you screaming.
- I wasn't scared. I just move fast.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.304
<i>Whatever.</i>

13:26.306 --> 13:28.206
What y'all doing?
Y'all cutting these trees?

13:29.508 --> 13:31.909
We're killing trees.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.711
What for?

13:33.713 --> 13:36.647
Nedermeyer land.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.784
The owner hires us to
get rid of what's on it

13:39.786 --> 13:44.222
so they can come in
and put strong pines on it.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.791
<i>Nobody wants these trees.</i>
<i>These trees are weak.</i>

13:46.793 --> 13:50.561
<i>They're not good for anything.</i>

13:50.563 --> 13:52.697
These boys will sit down if
I don't stay on their asses.

13:52.699 --> 13:54.599
- Hey, mister.
- Yeah?

13:54.601 --> 13:56.567
<i>I got a question for you.</i>

13:56.569 --> 13:57.835
You see, me and my daddy
just got into town.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.471
I was wondering if
you'd give us a job.

14:00.473 --> 14:04.609
We're looking for work.

14:04.611 --> 14:09.447
- How old are you?
- 15.

14:09.449 --> 14:12.817
Well, you got 45 seconds to
tell me why I should hire you.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.685
I baled hay before,
I worked on a truck.

14:14.687 --> 14:19.790
I picked tomatoes,
zucchini, cucumbers.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.792
Uh, okra. Squash.

14:21.794 --> 14:24.929
All right. You're not
afraid of work. Good.

14:24.931 --> 14:27.465
- What's your name?
- Gary Jones.

14:27.467 --> 14:28.933
I'm Joe.

14:28.935 --> 14:31.002
I pay a day's pay for a day's work.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.304
I pay on Fridays, so you get
a little something today.

14:33.306 --> 14:36.407
- Okay.
- <i>But your first real payday is next Friday.</i>

14:36.409 --> 14:38.843
We start about 6:00 in the morning,

14:38.845 --> 14:41.545
<i>quit at 1:00 or 2:00.</i>

14:41.547 --> 14:43.948
And if we work till dinner or get
rained out, I pay for the whole day.

14:43.950 --> 14:45.950
- Does that sound fair enough?
- Yes, sir.

14:45.952 --> 14:47.685
<i>All right. Follow
this line of trees...</i>

14:47.687 --> 14:50.021
- Yes, sir.
- Close to a half mile back to my truck.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.989
- Juice hatchets are in the back.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

14:51.991 --> 14:54.458
You get yourself one,
fill it up with poison,

14:54.460 --> 14:56.427
come on back same way you went out.

14:56.429 --> 14:57.962
- Yes, sir.
- And don't get lost.

14:57.964 --> 15:00.031
- I won't.
- Hey!

15:02.067 --> 15:04.835
Don't you want to know how
much you're getting paid?

15:04.837 --> 15:06.604
- How you doing?
- Good.

15:06.606 --> 15:07.938
Doing all right?
You ready to work today?

15:07.940 --> 15:09.674
- Yes, sir.
- I'm Junior.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.076
- Gary.
- Well, Gary, I'm gonna be over you today.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.645
Raise your right hand. You're gonna have
to swear you're gonna work hard for me.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.781
Not that hand, your right hand.
Your other right.

15:16.783 --> 15:19.383
Your right hand. There you go.

15:19.385 --> 15:21.419
<i>Put your hand up. You got
to swear on something.</i>

15:21.421 --> 15:24.422
Now you on the all-star team.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.524
- You promise to work hard?
- Yes, sir.

15:26.526 --> 15:29.960
I don't know why Joe chose you.
You must be a good man.

15:29.962 --> 15:32.096
First thing we do
is fill these containers up,

15:32.098 --> 15:33.831
so we just gonna
put it in there like that.

15:33.833 --> 15:36.767
Once we get it filled up
real good, then we on.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.869
- What's in the poison?
- Shit.

15:38.871 --> 15:41.339
Shorty's grandmas
make this in they basement.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.074
I don't know what's in it, but
we ain't gonna worry about it.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.975
I know it works real good.

15:44.977 --> 15:46.877
You thought that was easy
pumping that thing, didn't you?

15:46.879 --> 15:49.080
I made it look easy
'cause I'm a man.

15:49.082 --> 15:52.516
You're a little boy... you got to figure
it out. You see what I'm saying?

15:52.518 --> 15:54.819
There you go. See how
you figured that out?

15:54.821 --> 15:57.788
When you become a man, you gonna
have everything figured out too.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.758
Be careful. Now this
stuff is real poisonous

16:00.760 --> 16:03.427
and if it gets in your eyes,
man, you're out of there.

16:03.429 --> 16:07.732
Just ask Junior.
Now... now here you go.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.568
- Which hand you use?
- Uh, the right.

16:10.570 --> 16:11.450
Okay.

16:12.076 --> 16:14.972
Prime it up a little
bit, keep striking it.

16:14.974 --> 16:18.075
If you hit it hard enough, you only
have to hit it three or four times.

16:20.712 --> 16:23.714
Gotta get angry at the tree,
man. Get mad at it.

16:23.716 --> 16:26.784
Yeah, I like that. Get mad at it.
Keep on working it.

16:26.786 --> 16:29.520
Mad. Work with it, work with it!

16:29.522 --> 16:32.690
Yes, sir. Get it!

16:32.692 --> 16:33.924
Keep on with it, youngster.

16:33.926 --> 16:35.960
I like that, man.

16:35.962 --> 16:38.462
Joe's been around, he's been
around a little bit, man.

16:38.464 --> 16:41.599
He's got some things
up under his belt, man.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.168
So I advise you,
when you do go to Joe,

16:44.170 --> 16:47.505
keep it real with Joe. Don't
lie to him about nothing.

16:47.507 --> 16:50.174
And one thing Joe is real
particular about, man...

16:50.176 --> 16:53.177
don't never look down at the
ground. Look him in the face.

16:53.179 --> 16:56.680
He likes to see a man's eyes.
You... one-on-one.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.717
- That's how Joe is, man.
- Where you from?

16:59.719 --> 17:02.520
- Everywhere.
- Everywhere?

17:02.522 --> 17:04.722
Being a little bitty boy,
you been everywhere, huh?

17:04.723 --> 17:06.891
Was your daddy in the
military or something?

17:06.893 --> 17:11.662
Oh, yeah? All right. You got
a family? All right, then.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.897
You know we ain't gonna cut you
no slack out here, don't you?

17:13.900 --> 17:15.566
Just 'cause you're young now,

17:15.568 --> 17:16.934
you know we ain't
gonna cut no slack.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.569
<i>Everybody pull their
own load, baby.</i>

17:18.570 --> 17:20.538
Once we get this filled up here,

17:20.540 --> 17:23.707
we can kill us about a hundred
trees with this here.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.876
Is killing trees against the law?

17:25.877 --> 17:29.079
Well, the lumber company

17:29.081 --> 17:30.848
can't cut 'em down
unless they dead,

17:30.850 --> 17:32.917
and so the lumber company hire us

17:32.919 --> 17:35.519
to come in and poison the trees

17:35.521 --> 17:38.122
so we can kill 'em and they'll
come in and die theyself.

17:38.124 --> 17:40.057
Yeah, I've been doing this
for a little minute now.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.159
- Welcome to the program.
- Thanks.

17:42.161 --> 17:43.313
It's hard work out here.

17:43.639 --> 17:46.530
The machete crew is the one that
comes through and clears it out.

17:46.532 --> 17:47.798
Chop down at the angles.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.567
Try to get as low as you can.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.603
You gotta clear the path
for your teammates.

17:52.605 --> 17:56.507
Without you, none of
this is gonna happen.

17:56.509 --> 17:59.176
Just keep hammering at it.
Nothing's stopping you.

17:59.178 --> 18:00.678
You have to start out...
you'll probably be

18:00.680 --> 18:02.546
the water man for
a little while, you know?

18:02.548 --> 18:04.181
It's gonna look like you're
doing everything for everybody,

18:04.183 --> 18:07.985
bringing 'em water. At the end,
you'll become a machete vet.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.720
Samurai king, right here.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.056
- Waa-ah!
- Waa-ah!

18:12.058 --> 18:13.958
Welcome to the crew.
You're the youngest.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.559
<i>Gotta crawl 'fore you walk.</i>

18:15.561 --> 18:17.862
Got a lot of energy there.

18:17.864 --> 18:20.831
- Hah!
- There you go.

18:22.133 --> 18:25.936
- Samurai gods!
- Yah!

18:25.938 --> 18:28.005
Crew! When y'all get through
this side over here,

18:28.007 --> 18:29.273
we're going to the west side.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.008
<i>All right.</i>

18:31.010 --> 18:33.878
Hey, Gary, you're
getting too far ahead.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.614
Come on back here.
Help these fellas out.

18:50.762 --> 18:55.599
You know what? You, you and you,
y'all did a good job today.

18:55.601 --> 18:57.167
Why don't y'all
go ahead and get paid,

18:57.169 --> 18:59.870
and I'll see y'all
Monday, all right?

18:59.872 --> 19:00.971
Bill.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.007
- Allan.
- Thank you, sir.

19:03.009 --> 19:07.678
- And Gary, right?
- Yes, sir.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.548
Gary, Gary, Gary.

19:11.850 --> 19:14.285
Come back Monday.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.887
Bring your daddy
if he wants to work.

19:16.889 --> 19:19.857
Yes, sir, I will.

19:19.859 --> 19:22.126
We'll be there. Thanks.

19:55.994 --> 19:57.861
Mama!

19:57.863 --> 20:00.831
Hey, Mama, guess what?

20:01.866 --> 20:04.868
I got us jobs today.

20:04.870 --> 20:08.973
- I got a job today.
- Good for you, baby.

20:15.947 --> 20:19.216
<i>Dorothy!</i>
<i>Dorothy, guess what.</i>

20:19.218 --> 20:22.319
<i>He got one. That's good.</i>

20:33.832 --> 20:38.102
Stop! Sorry.

20:49.748 --> 20:52.316
Got that asshole put away?

20:52.318 --> 20:55.285
Yes, Joe, he's in the back.

20:55.287 --> 20:58.355
That asshole bites me again...

20:58.357 --> 21:00.190
Well, he's got the devil in him.

21:00.192 --> 21:04.194
- Fuck that.
- Come on, baby.

21:10.935 --> 21:13.037
Well, look at that. What's that?

21:13.039 --> 21:17.408
Come here.

21:17.410 --> 21:21.045
A Mexican game show.
That's what I'm talking about.

21:21.047 --> 21:25.349
<i>- Can I fix you something, baby?
- Coke, ice.</i>

21:35.960 --> 21:38.228
Here you go, sweetie.

21:44.803 --> 21:47.971
So what you got
the blues over, Joe?

21:47.973 --> 21:51.308
I'm not so bad.

21:51.310 --> 21:55.179
Want one of my girls?

21:55.181 --> 21:57.414
You want two of my girls?

21:57.416 --> 22:02.486
Not today. Today is a special day.

22:02.488 --> 22:07.324
- It is?
- I only want your company, Merle.

22:12.030 --> 22:16.233
- Why, thank you.
- Come here.

22:16.235 --> 22:19.236
Mmm!

22:21.372 --> 22:24.174
Lace!

22:24.176 --> 22:26.176
- Asshole!
- Lacy!

22:26.178 --> 22:28.912
Put the dog in the back!

22:28.914 --> 22:31.915
I got it. Come on. I got it.

22:31.917 --> 22:33.984
Come on.

22:35.887 --> 22:39.456
You don't need that thing
to take care of you.

22:40.759 --> 22:43.861
Where are you going, Joe?

22:49.100 --> 22:52.870
Girl, get your ass off the floor.

22:52.872 --> 22:56.774
Quit being stupid.

23:16.194 --> 23:19.463
- You see who that was?
- Yes.

23:19.465 --> 23:22.032
Was that World War I or II?
Where'd you get that hat?

23:22.034 --> 23:24.034
- W-W-2.
- Oh, right.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.969
Got it down there at the Army-Navy.

23:25.971 --> 23:28.939
Been making some money over at
Henry's house, throwing the dice.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.908
Yeah, I know. I was gonna go
over there later, clean him out.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.310
Maybe I'll see you there.

23:33.312 --> 23:35.145
I've been doing pretty
good taking the money

23:35.147 --> 23:38.282
from them old ladies that old
blind George hang out with.

23:39.670 --> 23:42.085
<i>Take about 60 or 70% of my winnings</i>

23:42.087 --> 23:44.188
and donate it to
the diabetes research.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.717
- Hmm.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

23:45.743 --> 23:49.326
Then I take the rest of it
and buy war paraphernalia.

23:49.328 --> 23:52.329
One of these days
I'm gonna be a regular GI Joe.

23:52.331 --> 23:54.498
Pow. Fistful of dollars!

23:54.500 --> 23:57.267
Or something like that.

24:10.048 --> 24:11.882
Henry.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.951
In here, Joe!

24:13.953 --> 24:17.855
Hey, Joe. How you been doing?

24:17.857 --> 24:19.139
What are you up to today?

24:19.165 --> 24:21.959
- Who's that?
- <i>Henry's just making a damn mess here.</i>

24:21.961 --> 24:24.228
- What are you trying to do, Henry?
- I don't know.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.035
Yeah, well, I don't think
I'd cut it into a roast.

24:32.037 --> 24:33.604
<i>No.</i>

24:33.606 --> 24:35.038
You can do it any way you want to,

24:35.040 --> 24:36.607
but if it was mine,
I'd cut it into steaks.

24:36.609 --> 24:38.942
Come over here and show
him how to do it, honey.

24:38.944 --> 24:40.978
And Henry, you can sit down there

24:40.980 --> 24:43.080
and tell me a joke
or sing a song or something.

24:43.082 --> 24:45.449
Shit, you might as well just
let Blind George cut it up.

24:45.451 --> 24:49.553
I'm gonna sit down and have me a
cigarette in this wheelchair.

24:49.555 --> 24:53.323
- Couldn't you, George?
- I reckon I could do better than he's doing it.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.925
- Oh, no.
- No.

24:54.927 --> 24:57.661
All right, I'll show you
how to make the steaks.

24:57.663 --> 25:00.497
That'd be good, baby.
I love back scrapple.

25:00.499 --> 25:04.001
That's good. That's enough.

25:12.377 --> 25:14.544
<i>Now look what happened
to the poor thing.</i>

25:14.546 --> 25:17.080
<i>So much blood on the floor.</i>

25:17.082 --> 25:19.516
<i>Oh, God. Oh.</i>

25:24.089 --> 25:26.623
Where'd you get this deer?

25:26.625 --> 25:29.593
It was hung up on
the fence over at Mr. Lee's,

25:29.595 --> 25:33.230
<i>and Henry and I was</i>
<i>coming back from the IHOP,</i>

25:33.232 --> 25:36.266
and I took out my .38
and shot her in the head.

25:36.968 --> 25:38.195
No.

25:38.221 --> 25:41.405
<i>Honey, you use that knife
just like an artist's brush.</i>

25:41.407 --> 25:44.675
<i>I mean, you know what
you're doing, Joe.</i>

25:44.677 --> 25:48.512
<i>Man, look at that. Oh, man.</i>

25:48.514 --> 25:51.014
- There's some good stuff here.
<i>- That is some good stuff.</i>

25:51.016 --> 25:54.284
Now look here.

25:54.286 --> 25:58.655
<i>Man, that is pretty.</i>

25:58.657 --> 26:02.526
Yeah, that's how you do it.
Butterfly steak.

26:02.528 --> 26:04.628
- <i>Wonderful.</i>
<i>- You see how I did that?</i>

26:04.630 --> 26:08.298
Now do it here, here and here.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.067
Y'all can cut up the rest of it.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.102
So, when you gonna
have another crap game?

26:12.104 --> 26:15.439
Uh, tonight. You wanna come by?

26:15.441 --> 26:17.074
- What time?
- 10:00.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.475
We're making a birthday cake.

26:18.877 --> 26:20.031
<i>We?</i>

26:20.057 --> 26:22.245
Joe, you know who's gonna
make the birthday cake.

26:22.247 --> 26:25.015
<i>I'm</i> gonna make a
birthday cake tonight.

26:25.017 --> 26:26.350
Are you, Stacy?

26:26.352 --> 26:28.485
<i>I love you, Henry,
but you know what?</i>

26:28.487 --> 26:30.487
I am the fucking birthday girl here

26:30.489 --> 26:32.522
and I have to make
my own damn cake?

26:32.524 --> 26:34.758
<i>It's not my problem.</i>

26:38.296 --> 26:41.331
<i>I'll make me a birthday
cake, no problem.</i>

26:41.333 --> 26:42.699
I gotta go uptown.
Y'all need anything?

26:42.701 --> 26:45.102
Honey, I think I need
some freezer paper.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.371
Bring me back some
damn freezer paper

26:47.373 --> 26:50.140
<i>and another pack of cigarettes.</i>

26:50.142 --> 26:53.210
- Good stuff.
- We love you, baby.

26:53.212 --> 26:55.045
<i>That back scrapple, that's the part</i>

26:55.047 --> 26:58.148
<i>that basically I only eat.</i>

27:00.218 --> 27:02.085
Hello, Joe!

27:07.626 --> 27:10.060
<i>Hold on, boy!</i>

27:21.773 --> 27:23.573
<i>Joe, you all right?</i>

27:26.110 --> 27:29.513
<i>You know who did that,
that asshole Willie.</i>

27:29.515 --> 27:31.114
<i>He's crazy.</i>

27:31.116 --> 27:34.251
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen,

27:34.253 --> 27:36.686
ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen.

28:10.655 --> 28:13.323
<i>Can we go now?</i>

28:13.325 --> 28:15.492
<i>What you doing?</i>

28:15.494 --> 28:19.229
Where you gonna go?

28:19.231 --> 28:21.531
We're gonna go into town
and get some food. Come on.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.133
Get something to eat with what?

28:23.135 --> 28:25.135
We ain't got hardly nothing here.

28:25.137 --> 28:27.604
Well, it ain't much,
but it's something.

28:27.606 --> 28:31.408
- Come on.
- I ain't getting up.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.777
Are you drunk?

28:33.779 --> 28:36.746
No, I ain't drunk.

28:36.748 --> 28:39.249
- I know you drunk.
- <i>No, I ain't drunk.</i>

28:39.251 --> 28:41.118
You're like, "I ain't drunk."

28:41.120 --> 28:44.154
I ain't take
my medicine today, boy.

28:44.156 --> 28:48.825
- I didn't take my medicine today.
- "I'm just tired."

28:48.827 --> 28:51.595
"I ain't drunk."

28:51.597 --> 28:54.264
- <i>Come on, get up.</i>
<i>- Uh, no.</i>

28:54.266 --> 28:55.499
Come on.

28:55.501 --> 28:59.436
Come on, get up.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.905
Come on, please?
You'll be all right.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.507
Come on. I'll help you up.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.575
You can make it.

29:09.814 --> 29:13.650
Yeah. No... you know what?

29:13.652 --> 29:17.320
I'm gonna sit right here
in the dirt.

29:17.322 --> 29:19.789
I'm gonna teach you
a little about break dancing.

29:19.791 --> 29:21.925
You ever see break dancing before?

29:21.927 --> 29:24.294
You know what "pop" and
you know what "locking" is?

29:24.296 --> 29:25.829
Huh, do you, bud?

29:25.831 --> 29:29.332
Take this hand right here,
pretend it's going over a wave

29:29.334 --> 29:30.934
like you're out there in the ocean.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.702
You floating. Come on, son.

29:32.704 --> 29:34.237
<i>You floating out in the ocean.</i>

29:34.239 --> 29:38.175
Whoa. Tidal wave coming
across the other side.

29:38.177 --> 29:41.344
Here we go. Oh, yeah.
We're waving now.

29:41.346 --> 29:43.780
Bring it back up.
Here comes the big one.

29:43.782 --> 29:48.385
Ow-oo! Yeah. Here it is. Hey! Hey!

29:48.387 --> 29:50.954
Oh, now, now. That shit
ain't funny right there.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.355
That shit ain't funny at all.

29:52.357 --> 29:54.958
I'll come get it now.

29:54.960 --> 29:58.328
You want it. You want it?

29:58.330 --> 29:59.663
I'm not through with my lesson.

29:59.665 --> 30:02.432
Life's lesson. You only
learned about waving.

30:02.434 --> 30:04.201
<i>Popping.</i>
<i>You ever see popping?</i>

30:04.203 --> 30:07.904
Pop. That's pop. You
know what locking is?

30:07.906 --> 30:09.272
I really can't do
a whole lot of locking

30:09.274 --> 30:12.709
unless I'm standing and...

30:12.711 --> 30:13.977
Stand up. Come on.

30:13.979 --> 30:15.845
I don't see myself
doing much of that

30:15.847 --> 30:19.249
in the near future there, son.

30:19.251 --> 30:20.517
I know you drunk 'cause
you about to spill it.

30:20.519 --> 30:23.653
Oh, did I spill it?
I need a pillow.

30:23.655 --> 30:26.623
Ah. There we go.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.558
<i>Yeah.</i>

30:28.560 --> 30:32.295
One, two...

30:41.639 --> 30:43.540
<i>Hey, mister.</i>

30:45.676 --> 30:48.278
Hey, mister.

30:48.280 --> 30:51.514
<i>Can you give me a ride?</i>

30:51.516 --> 30:52.849
Say it again?

30:52.851 --> 30:54.684
Me and my daddy was wondering

30:54.686 --> 30:56.920
if you could give us
a ride back to town.

30:56.922 --> 30:58.555
He ain't feelin' too good.

31:00.759 --> 31:02.425
Shit, yeah.

31:02.427 --> 31:04.794
Yeah, I'll give you boys a ride.

31:04.796 --> 31:06.997
Come on. Where's your daddy at?

31:06.999 --> 31:09.833
He's back that-away.

31:11.602 --> 31:14.037
What you chunk that gun
off the bridge for?

31:17.341 --> 31:20.443
I just threw it.

31:20.445 --> 31:21.945
You know?

31:21.947 --> 31:27.951
Weapons tend to make men
do violent things.

31:27.953 --> 31:31.788
You know, guns...

31:31.790 --> 31:35.292
knives, cannonballs...

31:35.294 --> 31:37.827
little sticks of dynamite.

31:37.829 --> 31:42.999
Hell, even automobiles.

31:45.604 --> 31:49.873
Hey. Come here.

31:49.875 --> 31:52.509
Look at my face.

31:52.511 --> 31:55.312
You see that?

31:55.314 --> 31:57.080
I see it.

31:57.082 --> 31:59.683
I went through a windshield
at 4:00 one morning,

31:59.685 --> 32:02.686
and I don't give a fuck.

32:02.688 --> 32:05.088
<i>Now, folks looking for trouble</i>

32:05.090 --> 32:07.524
<i>tend to find more</i>
<i>than they're after,</i>

32:07.526 --> 32:11.094
and I'll kill his fucking ass
if he ever slaps me again.

32:11.096 --> 32:14.864
- You understand me?
- Who you talking about?

32:14.866 --> 32:17.600
If he ever...

32:17.602 --> 32:22.105
slaps me...

32:22.107 --> 32:23.973
again.

32:34.952 --> 32:38.488
Oh. You got any sisters?

32:38.490 --> 32:42.892
- What?
- Sisters!

32:42.894 --> 32:46.463
You got any sisters?

32:46.465 --> 32:50.633
Is she pretty?

32:50.635 --> 32:52.736
Mister, don't you talk
about my sister.

32:52.738 --> 32:56.106
<i>Oh, well, shit.</i>

32:56.108 --> 32:59.909
You're a tough little
sumbitch, ain't you?

32:59.911 --> 33:01.578
Who the fuck you talking to, huh?

33:01.580 --> 33:03.012
I'm talking to you, mister.

33:03.014 --> 33:05.382
Don't you disrespect my family.

33:07.451 --> 33:08.818
You know what I think?

33:08.820 --> 33:11.421
I think I'm gonna say
whatever the fuck I wanna say.

33:11.423 --> 33:15.091
You get the hell off me, mister.
I ain't done nothing to you.

33:16.994 --> 33:20.563
I don't think I want to
give you that ride no more.

33:20.565 --> 33:23.566
Mm-mm. I think I'm gonna take you

33:23.568 --> 33:25.635
and I'm gonna throw
you off that bridge.

33:25.637 --> 33:27.904
See how you like that, hmm?

33:27.906 --> 33:29.906
Hmm?

33:31.642 --> 33:34.811
Look at me, son. Look at my face.

33:34.813 --> 33:37.013
I went through a windshield
at 4:00 one morning,

33:37.015 --> 33:38.715
and I don't give a fuck.

33:46.958 --> 33:49.459
Look at me, you son of a bitch!

33:49.461 --> 33:52.095
You stupid motherfucker,
you think I'm a kid?

33:52.097 --> 33:53.830
You think I'm a goddamn kid?

33:53.832 --> 33:57.000
I'll beat your ass and
now you know it's true!

35:27.925 --> 35:31.194
Quiet!

35:38.002 --> 35:40.003
<i>Joe!</i>

35:45.743 --> 35:48.912
Joe! Is he gonna bite me?

35:48.914 --> 35:50.613
God damn it, would you shut up?

35:50.615 --> 35:53.716
Shut up and get back under there!
Let these ladies alone.

35:53.718 --> 35:55.718
Git!

35:55.720 --> 35:59.689
Y'all come on. Dog won't bite.

36:04.194 --> 36:06.729
That dog's crazy. What
if you hadn't been here?

36:06.731 --> 36:08.131
If I hadn't been here,

36:08.133 --> 36:09.632
you wouldn't have had no
business in my goddamn yard.

36:09.634 --> 36:11.734
Damn, what happened to you?

36:11.736 --> 36:14.938
Oh, hang on a minute.

36:20.879 --> 36:23.079
The place is a mess, Joe.

36:23.081 --> 36:26.149
<i>I wasn't expecting company.</i>

36:26.151 --> 36:28.952
Well, we was just driving around,

36:28.954 --> 36:31.287
<i>looking for something to do.</i>

36:31.289 --> 36:34.090
Didn't know
if you'd be home or not.

36:35.726 --> 36:36.893
Open up!

37:10.060 --> 37:13.630
Are you all right?

37:13.632 --> 37:17.066
I gotta quit smoking.

37:17.068 --> 37:20.069
What the hell happened to you?

37:21.872 --> 37:24.774
I slapped some asshole the
other night at the bar.

37:24.776 --> 37:26.142
He come back and he shot me.

37:26.144 --> 37:28.711
Jesus, Joe.

37:28.713 --> 37:31.114
What, you and Willie Russell
be running around,

37:31.116 --> 37:32.882
acting like kids again?

37:32.884 --> 37:34.751
It's ridiculous.
I don't even remember

37:34.753 --> 37:36.886
what set you off
in the first place.

37:40.324 --> 37:42.759
Neither do I.

37:42.761 --> 37:46.029
So what was it you
wanted to talk about?

37:46.031 --> 37:47.397
You need some money?

37:47.399 --> 37:51.768
No, nothing like that.

37:56.341 --> 38:01.010
You know that guy Frank? The guy?

38:01.012 --> 38:02.879
He's back in town.

38:02.881 --> 38:04.847
<i>And I don't want</i>
<i>to stay at my mama's.</i>

38:04.849 --> 38:06.182
I thought she run him off.

38:06.184 --> 38:09.018
<i>She did. Twice.</i>

38:09.020 --> 38:11.988
But he called the other night.

38:13.323 --> 38:16.959
Came back begging for forgiveness.

38:16.961 --> 38:18.361
<i>She said he could stay</i>

38:18.363 --> 38:21.230
<i>as long as he promised</i>
<i>to leave me alone.</i>

38:21.232 --> 38:24.067
And he promised.

38:24.069 --> 38:28.838
Just like he always does, but...

38:32.342 --> 38:36.112
Still got your job
up at the cleaners?

38:41.051 --> 38:44.253
- Good.
- <i>I wouldn't even hardly be here.</i>

38:46.323 --> 38:48.491
I could take care of you...

38:49.493 --> 38:51.828
<i>if you let me.</i>

38:53.163 --> 38:56.165
I promise I won't even
tell her where I'm at.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.767
You won't have to. She'll know.

38:57.769 --> 39:01.504
She already called here
40 times looking for you.

39:06.076 --> 39:09.912
You can stay with me
if you need to.

39:09.914 --> 39:15.251
I can't promise you much,
but I'll try to be nice.

39:17.321 --> 39:19.956
One, two, three, six, 11.

39:19.958 --> 39:22.325
Get off your ass. You ain't
nothing but a number.

39:22.327 --> 39:24.160
<i>Let's go, y'all.</i>

39:24.162 --> 39:27.964
<i>Yo, Sam, where you been?
Haven't seen you around.</i>

39:27.966 --> 39:30.032
You in those night school
classes or something?

39:30.034 --> 39:31.434
Not yet.

39:31.436 --> 39:33.970
Doing a little work on the side.

39:33.972 --> 39:36.806
Trying to make a little extra
cash, get my shit together.

39:36.808 --> 39:39.208
- You know what I mean?
- Oh, I know what you mean.

39:39.210 --> 39:42.311
I know. We're just not good enough
for you anymore, are we, Sam?

39:42.313 --> 39:44.247
I didn't say that.

39:44.249 --> 39:47.216
Who these white folks
you got working?

39:47.218 --> 39:51.521
<i>Yeah, I'm not sure. They
need work and I need help.</i>

39:51.523 --> 39:54.357
<i>Young, old, black,</i>
<i>white, red, yellow.</i>

39:54.359 --> 39:56.459
<i>I really don't give a shit, Sammy.</i>

39:56.461 --> 39:59.462
Water. Where's your fucking water?

40:26.924 --> 40:31.527
That's my water there.
Why you drinking my water?

40:31.529 --> 40:33.930
Thirsty, that's why.

40:33.932 --> 40:36.265
That's my personal water.

40:36.267 --> 40:39.502
Why you drinking
my water up like that?

40:39.504 --> 40:43.272
We're gonna have a problem
outta you all day, huh?

40:44.842 --> 40:46.576
If I catch you with my water again,

40:46.578 --> 40:49.345
<i>you're gonna have</i>
<i>a problem outta me.</i>

40:49.347 --> 40:52.381
- Joe sent you down here with me?
- Yeah.

40:52.383 --> 40:54.517
Let me help you with that pack.

40:54.519 --> 40:56.886
The hell you use this thing for?

40:56.888 --> 41:00.289
I'll show you how
to walk through it.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.458
Man, this thing's heavy.

41:02.460 --> 41:06.095
You use this lever right
here to pump out the poison.

41:06.097 --> 41:08.965
You take this hatchet
and hit into the tree.

41:08.967 --> 41:13.236
Let's see what you got.

41:13.238 --> 41:15.371
Hit it right here.

41:15.373 --> 41:16.939
Goddamn thing is leaking all over.

41:16.941 --> 41:18.407
It happens sometimes.
Let's get to work.

41:18.409 --> 41:20.409
Let's hit right here.

41:22.112 --> 41:24.113
This is bullshit right here.

41:25.182 --> 41:26.649
<i>Swing it.</i>

41:26.651 --> 41:29.352
<i>You gotta swing it</i>
<i>harder than that.</i>

41:29.954 --> 41:31.358
<i>Come on, man, get into it.</i>

41:31.384 --> 41:35.057
<i>Man, this is some
stupid-ass shit, man.</i>

41:35.059 --> 41:37.260
You know he can't even talk now.

41:37.262 --> 41:41.964
Y'all niggas... y'all niggas didn't
eat it. I am hungry.

41:41.966 --> 41:43.966
<i>Ain't gonna kill you with
our greenback there.</i>

41:43.968 --> 41:45.193
<i>I don't want to know, Junior.</i>

41:45.219 --> 41:48.104
I don't want to know about your king cobra,
okay? Or whatever you call it.

41:48.106 --> 41:49.746
"Go Go Gadget Tongue,"
that's what he got.

41:52.076 --> 41:53.542
You ever notice that
about your girl, man,

41:53.544 --> 41:55.560
one of her breasts is bigger
than the other one, man?

41:55.586 --> 41:58.247
- Wait a minute.
- No, one sit up here and the
other one sit down here?

41:58.249 --> 42:01.417
<i>No comment, no comment.</i>

42:04.622 --> 42:06.455
- <i>Don't go head first.</i>
<i>- I don't.</i>

42:06.457 --> 42:08.181
<i>Don't go in there head first.</i>

42:08.207 --> 42:11.160
<i>Tell the truth about them drips he
had, man, about that penicillin shot.</i>

42:11.162 --> 42:13.663
<i>That's a lie! That's a damn lie!
That's a damn lie!</i>

42:16.500 --> 42:18.434
Sure is a beautiful day
out here, ain't it?

42:18.436 --> 42:19.969
It's all right.

42:19.971 --> 42:21.370
Sitting here like the
angels sitting there

42:21.372 --> 42:23.973
under this pretty sun.

42:23.975 --> 42:25.641
Maybe I am an angel.

42:25.643 --> 42:27.376
Yeah, but you gotta
go to work on my job.

42:27.378 --> 42:30.012
You ain't on my job working.
Why you not working today?

42:30.014 --> 42:32.048
What, did you come up here
to give me a hard time?

42:32.050 --> 42:33.482
I been looking at you
all goddamn day,

42:33.484 --> 42:34.617
and I see you up here
smoking a goddamn cigarette

42:34.619 --> 42:36.185
watching the goddamn water.

42:36.187 --> 42:37.954
You think you're a pretty
sumbitch out here,

42:37.956 --> 42:39.356
and we gotta come out here to work.

42:39.357 --> 42:41.324
I don't know why you
ain't trying to work.

42:41.326 --> 42:43.292
I done all the work
I'm gonna do today.

42:43.294 --> 42:45.294
So you ain't did shit
all goddamn day.

42:45.296 --> 42:46.696
You ain't done a motherfucking...

42:46.698 --> 42:49.298
- And who are you to tell me?
- I'm your goddamn boss.

42:49.300 --> 42:51.233
As long as you here, I'm your boss.

42:51.235 --> 42:52.601
You ain't my boss, and obviously

42:52.603 --> 42:54.236
you can't even watch
what people are doing,

42:54.238 --> 42:56.072
'cause if you saw anything,

42:56.074 --> 42:57.474
you know I've been working all day.

42:57.475 --> 42:59.108
I've been working all damn day!

42:59.110 --> 43:03.279
Yeah... no, you been on
your ass all goddamn day!

43:03.281 --> 43:04.647
Who's gonna argue with who?

43:04.649 --> 43:05.748
You ain't did shit all goddamn...

43:05.750 --> 43:07.450
I'm trying to get you working!

43:07.452 --> 43:08.517
Man, I worked my ass off!

43:08.519 --> 43:10.486
You ain't did shit all goddamn day!

43:10.488 --> 43:13.522
I told you, get to work! You're gonna
get your ass off my motherfucking job!

43:13.524 --> 43:16.398
Well, you go tell Joe right now!
Go tell him, huh?

43:16.424 --> 43:19.528
Joe goddamn gonna get rid of
you or do something different.

43:19.530 --> 43:21.364
Something gonna change today

43:21.366 --> 43:23.532
'cause tomorrow, we ain't
gonna have this bullshit.

43:23.534 --> 43:25.634
- Are you done?
- Yeah, I'm done with this bullshit.

43:25.636 --> 43:27.303
Good, I'm glad you're done!

43:27.305 --> 43:30.072
I'm glad you're done. Stay done.

43:31.575 --> 43:34.610
Look like you got a yeast
infection on your goddamn face,

43:34.612 --> 43:36.345
you country motherfucker!

43:55.165 --> 43:56.565
Can you make it out of there?

43:56.567 --> 43:59.635
Yeah, I'll make it, I guess.

43:59.637 --> 44:02.304
Goddamn assholes.

44:03.774 --> 44:06.108
Come here, son.

44:06.110 --> 44:07.610
Help me get over this tailgate.

44:07.612 --> 44:09.311
So what time you need us
back in the morning?

44:09.313 --> 44:12.248
I don't need you
back in the morning.

44:12.250 --> 44:13.716
What do you mean
you don't need us back?

44:13.718 --> 44:16.652
We got the job done, didn't we?

44:16.654 --> 44:19.221
This is yours there, son.

44:23.760 --> 44:26.796
We got the job done.
Gary said we got the job.

44:26.798 --> 44:28.397
Joe, I'll do anything you want.

44:28.399 --> 44:32.568
Clear brush anytime, anywhere.
I can do it.

44:32.570 --> 44:34.136
<i>Joe, I'd sure like
to work some more.</i>

44:34.138 --> 44:37.573
Yeah, maybe later.
I'll let you know.

44:41.311 --> 44:43.646
I don't know what you did

44:43.648 --> 44:45.748
<i>that made that man mad, son.</i>

44:45.750 --> 44:48.184
You hear me?

44:55.392 --> 44:57.126
The hell you looking at?

45:11.508 --> 45:15.311
Just another day.

45:15.313 --> 45:17.580
It ain't his fault.

45:17.582 --> 45:22.318
He loves us. Just...

45:22.320 --> 45:25.721
He just goes through a hard time.

45:36.433 --> 45:38.167
Well, I ain't gonna
watch him sit there

45:38.169 --> 45:40.636
and hit you like he
hits me, you hear me?

45:40.638 --> 45:42.638
Okay, Mama?

45:45.142 --> 45:48.711
Ain't supposed to do
that to no one.

45:54.584 --> 45:59.188
<i>You stay with your family.</i>

45:59.190 --> 46:01.724
That's what you need to do.

46:01.726 --> 46:05.327
You need to stay with your family.

46:08.598 --> 46:11.600
Your family's all you got.

46:25.315 --> 46:28.417
What was that?

46:28.419 --> 46:30.719
I don't know.

46:30.721 --> 46:33.956
- Didn't hear no car drive up.
- Probably ain't nobody.

46:33.958 --> 46:36.959
Ain't nobody with
any sense out in this.

46:36.961 --> 46:40.729
<i>- I'm just a medium.</i>
- Can't taste that.

46:44.935 --> 46:48.204
<i>You want to go out tonight?</i>

46:48.206 --> 46:50.773
Not really.

46:52.776 --> 46:56.345
<i>Where do you want to go?</i>

46:56.347 --> 46:58.380
Hmm...

46:58.382 --> 47:02.651
I don't know.

47:02.653 --> 47:04.687
I was just wondering

47:04.689 --> 47:06.689
if we were gonna do something.

47:08.458 --> 47:11.560
I think you work too much.

47:13.697 --> 47:15.664
You should get out.

47:15.666 --> 47:18.334
Do something fun.

47:18.336 --> 47:21.270
I hadn't planned on it.

47:21.272 --> 47:23.872
Unless you want to.

47:28.612 --> 47:31.880
We don't have to.

47:34.285 --> 47:37.353
Ah...

47:37.355 --> 47:38.787
There's someone out there.

47:38.789 --> 47:43.359
No. No, wait. Hold this.

47:53.403 --> 47:55.804
Hey, Joe, can you put that dog up?

47:55.806 --> 47:58.907
Oh, hell, I know who it is.

48:00.610 --> 48:03.879
Boy, you're soaking-ass wet.

48:03.881 --> 48:06.282
What'd you plan to do,
stand there all night?

48:06.284 --> 48:08.550
He should get out
of them wet clothes.

48:08.552 --> 48:10.286
- He'll get sick.
- I'm all right.

48:10.288 --> 48:11.854
I just... I just wanted to come by

48:11.856 --> 48:14.356
- and talk to you about working some more.
- Work?

48:14.358 --> 48:15.824
Don't you see what it's
doing out there?

48:15.826 --> 48:18.527
Yes, sir.

48:18.529 --> 48:21.030
Hey, where's my drink at?
You got any trousers he can wear?

48:21.032 --> 48:22.431
What size waist you got?

48:22.433 --> 48:25.634
I think I have some
cool pants he can wear.

48:27.971 --> 48:30.539
I bet nobody come mess 'round
here with that dog out there.

48:30.541 --> 48:31.974
<i>Well, that's why I got the dog.</i>

48:31.976 --> 48:34.543
The dog won't bother anybody
just walking down the road.

48:34.545 --> 48:36.312
Road ain't dogs.

48:36.314 --> 48:37.579
<i>Dog knows what's dogs.</i>

48:37.581 --> 48:38.847
<i>You could have just walked on off,</i>

48:38.849 --> 48:40.049
<i>the dog wouldn't</i>
<i>have done anything.</i>

48:40.051 --> 48:42.451
All right, here. Try these on.

48:42.453 --> 48:44.920
I think they'll fit you.

48:44.922 --> 48:48.057
The bathroom's this way.

48:48.059 --> 48:49.792
<i>The dog is a good dog.</i>

48:49.794 --> 48:53.429
Yeah. That dog scared
the hell out of me, though.

48:54.564 --> 48:56.432
He's all beat up.

48:56.434 --> 48:59.101
Mm-hmm. His daddy.

48:59.103 --> 49:01.570
Saw him do it.

49:02.839 --> 49:04.573
You what?

49:04.575 --> 49:07.476
What, you just sat there

49:07.478 --> 49:09.745
and watched it, or what?

49:09.747 --> 49:12.748
He's a big kid.

49:14.984 --> 49:18.721
I can't get my hands dirty
in every little thing.

49:18.723 --> 49:20.422
You know how I get.

49:20.424 --> 49:21.990
You're a grown man, Joe.

49:21.992 --> 49:24.360
What is that supposed to mean?

49:24.362 --> 49:26.929
It can mean whatever
you want it to mean.

49:26.931 --> 49:29.631
Don't fool yourself
too much about me.

49:34.637 --> 49:37.673
<i>Hey, there you go.</i>

49:37.675 --> 49:39.007
You look like a million bucks.

49:39.009 --> 49:42.611
<i>Feel better now?</i>

49:42.613 --> 49:45.381
I feel like a hundred bucks.

49:45.383 --> 49:48.517
Come by 'cause I wanted to
talk to you about my job.

49:49.652 --> 49:52.888
I wanna work. I need a job.

49:52.890 --> 49:55.924
My daddy don't care
if he gots a job, but I do.

49:55.926 --> 49:58.894
You'd work in this rain,
wouldn't you?

49:59.896 --> 50:02.431
If you need me to.

50:05.168 --> 50:08.470
Let me slip my shoes on.
I'll run you back home.

50:14.411 --> 50:18.180
Hey, we'll be there
in just a second, okay?

50:19.616 --> 50:21.817
Hey.

50:21.819 --> 50:24.686
You know you don't have to take
no shit from nobody, right?

50:25.722 --> 50:28.023
You know that, right?

50:28.025 --> 50:30.025
Yes, ma'am.

50:30.027 --> 50:34.196
Good. Now let's go.

50:36.900 --> 50:38.834
- How you been, Chris?
- Good, how about you?

50:38.836 --> 50:39.691
Doing all right.

50:39.717 --> 50:42.471
- You still doing the mixed martial arts?
- Yes, sir.

50:42.473 --> 50:44.640
What you doing
out in the rain, Joe?

50:44.642 --> 50:47.743
Oh, I need two pounds of ham

50:47.745 --> 50:50.679
- and a pound of Swiss cheese sliced up.
- All right.

50:50.681 --> 50:51.880
Come on, you get the cheese,
I'll get the ham.

50:51.882 --> 50:56.552
Yes, sir. Looks like every time I get a
little ahead, it starts in raining again.

51:02.792 --> 51:05.994
Here you go.

51:05.996 --> 51:08.163
Well, it's not much. Now look here.

51:08.165 --> 51:10.632
When it dries up,

51:10.634 --> 51:13.068
you come down here early
in the morning, 'fore light,

51:13.070 --> 51:14.956
and I'll pick you up
and take you to work.

51:14.982 --> 51:17.105
We got plenty to do when
the weather gets right.

51:17.107 --> 51:20.242
You got a clock? No, you wouldn't.

51:20.244 --> 51:22.845
All right, I'll find you a
wind-up clock or something.

51:22.847 --> 51:24.146
All right, then.

51:24.148 --> 51:25.747
Thank you, sir.

51:25.749 --> 51:27.749
No, you don't need to call
me "sir" all the time.

51:27.751 --> 51:31.653
I'm your friend, you understand?

51:31.655 --> 51:33.789
All right. Hey, where's his ham?

51:33.791 --> 51:36.158
<i>- Hang on, we're coming.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

51:56.246 --> 51:58.213
Ahem.

52:09.025 --> 52:12.027
What are you thinking, Joe?

52:14.030 --> 52:16.031
Nothing.

52:17.767 --> 52:21.036
There's nothing I can do,
and I hate it.

52:22.205 --> 52:25.674
That's not true.

52:25.676 --> 52:29.044
Yeah, it is.

52:31.015 --> 52:34.816
<i>You look at me like
I can make a move.</i>

52:34.818 --> 52:37.052
<i>What are you thinking when</i>
<i>you look at me like that?</i>

52:37.054 --> 52:40.722
<i>Don't you care?</i>

52:40.724 --> 52:42.190
<i>I don't know who I am.</i>

52:45.262 --> 52:51.767
<i>But I know what keeps
me alive is restraint.</i>

52:51.769 --> 52:55.003
<i>It keeps me out of jail.</i>

52:55.005 --> 52:57.706
<i>Keeps me from hurting people.</i>

53:04.314 --> 53:07.683
Hey.

53:07.685 --> 53:12.621
<i>The mark of some fucked-up
faith that there is a reason.</i>

53:12.623 --> 53:13.755
Thank you.

53:13.757 --> 53:17.059
<i>A reason for all of this.</i>

53:17.061 --> 53:21.063
<i>A reason in most moments
I shouldn't do what I want to do.</i>

53:23.132 --> 53:26.101
<i>I do as I'm told.</i>

53:28.739 --> 53:32.274
<i>These men who bust their asses</i>
<i>work like dogs.</i>

53:33.876 --> 53:37.946
<i>I believe in them,</i>
<i>but every day, they hurt.</i>

53:39.148 --> 53:42.317
<i>They get old, they peel back.</i>

53:45.321 --> 53:48.624
<i>There's no frontier anymore.</i>

53:48.626 --> 53:50.258
Allan.

53:50.260 --> 53:52.694
Clark.

53:52.696 --> 53:55.097
Gary.

53:55.099 --> 53:58.300
<i>And I watch that boy,</i>

53:58.302 --> 54:01.269
<i>and I see someone</i>
<i>who's nothing like me,</i>

54:01.271 --> 54:06.341
<i>but he's a child</i>
<i>folks left behind...</i>

54:06.343 --> 54:09.778
<i>with no defense.</i>

54:09.780 --> 54:14.016
<i>Balanced right there.</i>

54:15.318 --> 54:17.686
What do you want?

54:22.358 --> 54:28.163
<i>- What is it you want?</i>
<i>- Nothing.</i>

54:31.435 --> 54:34.836
<i>Just tell me what I can do.</i>

54:37.340 --> 54:39.741
<i>I like you.</i>

54:42.211 --> 54:45.280
<i>I like you too, but what's
the point in any of it?</i>

54:51.220 --> 54:54.423
<i>Fuck to this day.</i>

54:54.425 --> 54:57.726
<i>I mean, fuck to this day.</i>

55:01.297 --> 55:06.268
<i>It's all just gonna boil up</i>
<i>and wash us away.</i>

55:11.908 --> 55:14.876
<i>And he'll still be here.</i>

55:18.915 --> 55:20.749
<i>Or maybe he won't.</i>

55:30.960 --> 55:33.995
Damn, Joe, why do you keep loading all
these fools in this little truck?

55:33.997 --> 55:35.430
Good to have you
with us again, Sammy.

55:35.432 --> 55:36.898
You drop down any more,
we're gonna have to

55:36.900 --> 55:38.500
get out and push,
and I ain't pushing shit.

55:38.502 --> 55:40.969
I thought you had your
eye on a new truck, Joe.

55:40.971 --> 55:42.738
I ain't getting no new truck.

55:42.740 --> 55:45.240
- You need one.
- No, I don't.

55:45.242 --> 55:47.776
If you get a new truck, how
much you want for this old one?

55:47.778 --> 55:49.444
You mean this old piece of junk?

55:49.446 --> 55:52.781
Smell like somebody done
died up in there. It's nasty.

55:52.783 --> 55:54.182
I don't mind the smell. I like it.

55:54.184 --> 55:56.084
It smells good to me.

55:56.086 --> 55:58.320
Yeah, but this thing...

55:58.322 --> 56:01.490
I spend as much time working
on it as I do driving it.

56:01.492 --> 56:04.326
'Course there ain't
nothing major wrong with it.

56:04.328 --> 56:06.828
Just little shit. You know,
it needs some brakes.

56:06.830 --> 56:08.964
It needs a new...

56:08.966 --> 56:13.168
Joe, come on.

56:13.170 --> 56:15.036
I'll buy it from you.
I'll work my butt off.

56:15.038 --> 56:17.339
I love the truck. You have
to give it to me now.

56:17.341 --> 56:21.009
Well, I mean, it's got
a lot of miles on it.

56:21.011 --> 56:22.911
You'd be better finding
one in town somewhere.

56:22.913 --> 56:25.380
I don't want one in town.
I like that one.

56:26.916 --> 56:29.818
Come on, Joe.

56:31.053 --> 56:33.922
All right. I'll take $900 for it...

56:33.924 --> 56:35.991
if I get a new truck.

56:35.993 --> 56:37.325
All right. Shake hands.

56:37.327 --> 56:39.361
That's what I'm talking about.
Heck, yeah.

56:39.363 --> 56:41.329
<i>All right, hey, y'all, let's go!</i>

57:09.926 --> 57:13.428
Hey, what you got there?

58:46.656 --> 58:48.390
Hey.

58:48.392 --> 58:50.358
I was wondering if maybe
you could tell me

58:50.360 --> 58:52.227
how to get down to Water Valley.

58:52.229 --> 58:55.630
<i>My wife, she's in</i>
<i>the hospital down there.</i>

58:55.632 --> 58:58.199
<i>I just now got here.</i>

58:58.201 --> 59:01.036
<i>You know how far it is?</i>

59:03.472 --> 59:06.174
Is that the highway
that goes to it?

59:06.176 --> 59:09.311
<i>Is it?</i>

59:09.313 --> 59:10.979
What you drinking?

59:10.981 --> 59:14.983
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

59:18.120 --> 59:21.556
You ain't drinking
some wine, are you?

59:21.558 --> 59:23.391
I may.

59:23.393 --> 59:24.960
Yeah, nothing wrong with that.

59:24.962 --> 59:28.129
Some folks think a feller
ought not drink at all,

59:28.131 --> 59:30.598
but a little drink
never hurt nobody.

59:30.600 --> 59:32.968
That's right.

59:32.970 --> 59:36.471
I get me a little drink every now and
then when I'm down at the house,

59:36.473 --> 59:39.074
but the old lady, she raises
so much sand about it,

59:39.076 --> 59:41.743
I don't do a lot
of drinking down there.

59:41.745 --> 59:45.080
I usually wait till I get
uptown like I am now.

59:45.082 --> 59:47.415
Grab me a drink.

59:49.118 --> 59:51.753
She all right?

59:51.755 --> 59:53.621
Yeah, yeah. She is today.

59:53.623 --> 59:58.026
That's why I'm trying to get down there
to Water Valley, go see about her.

59:58.028 --> 01:00:00.161
I was supposed
to have got paid today,

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:03.064
but the old fella,
he never showed up,

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:07.135
you know, so I think I'll
go get me a little drink,

01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:10.438
go down to Water Valley
and go see how she's doing.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.674
She in the hospital?

01:00:12.676 --> 01:00:16.511
Yeah, she's in the hospital.
She got cancer.

01:00:16.513 --> 01:00:19.347
Just eat up with it all over.

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:21.616
You know.

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:24.085
Damn thing, you know,
a person just don't know

01:00:24.087 --> 01:00:25.754
from one day to the next

01:00:25.756 --> 01:00:28.223
which one's gonna be their last.

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:36.097
Well, it's a beautiful
day out there.

01:00:36.099 --> 01:00:38.700
Feeling a little chill in my bones.

01:00:38.702 --> 01:00:41.636
I think it's fixing to rain.

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:44.406
<i>It's probably fixing to rain some.</i>

01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:29.277
<i>Three African painted dogs...</i>

01:02:29.279 --> 01:02:34.816
wild dogs... killed a
three-year-old in the zoo.

01:02:34.818 --> 01:02:39.354
This toddler, he fell
in, hit his head,

01:02:39.356 --> 01:02:42.657
and the dogs got him.

01:02:42.659 --> 01:02:45.860
Where was everybody?

01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:59.807
A little kid.

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:10.852
Hello, Joe.

01:03:10.854 --> 01:03:13.288
How you doing?

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:19.494
Oh. Sumbitch.

01:03:20.529 --> 01:03:24.432
I'll tell you what, buddy.

01:03:24.434 --> 01:03:28.469
All this goddamn back and
forth and back and forth.

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:32.840
I'm fucking over it.

01:03:32.842 --> 01:03:35.343
Yeah, well...

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:42.784
Maybe it's time we just... bygones.

01:03:48.857 --> 01:03:51.693
You know I could have
killed you, right?

01:03:51.695 --> 01:03:53.628
I could have killed you,
but I didn't.

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:57.265
I licked you. I was aiming
for the trees, see?

01:03:57.267 --> 01:03:59.801
That shot was meant
as a warning shot,

01:03:59.803 --> 01:04:02.270
'cause all you keep doing
is embarrassing me

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:05.273
in front of my goddamn friends.

01:04:05.275 --> 01:04:07.375
I mean, hell, the last
time you slapped me,

01:04:07.377 --> 01:04:11.346
there was ladies and gentlemen
present.

01:04:14.283 --> 01:04:15.617
So what's this shit I hear

01:04:15.619 --> 01:04:19.454
about this kid you got
working for you, huh?

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:24.993
Little drifter kid,
about yea big, hmm?

01:04:24.995 --> 01:04:27.428
I don't really
give a shit about him,

01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:31.799
but I suspect you know
where he lives, don't you?

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:34.936
No.

01:04:34.938 --> 01:04:37.805
Huh.

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:40.441
What's wrong, Spooky?

01:04:40.443 --> 01:04:43.344
You still sore at me?

01:04:58.662 --> 01:05:02.830
Christy, call the cops
'fore somebody gets killed.

01:05:02.832 --> 01:05:05.767
Would you do that for me, honey?

01:05:25.821 --> 01:05:28.856
<i>Hold on.</i>

01:05:31.561 --> 01:05:35.430
Get back. Hold it! Hey, Joe.

01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:38.833
- Is Merle around?
- Merle ain't here.

01:05:38.835 --> 01:05:42.103
- You all right?
- I want to get blown, but...

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:44.706
Oh, that's right,
you don't like dogs, do you?

01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:47.575
That's not true. I love dogs.
Just not <i>that</i> dog.

01:05:47.577 --> 01:05:50.511
- That dog is an <i>asshole!</i>
<i>- I'm sorry, Joe.</i>

01:05:50.513 --> 01:05:52.613
Y'all help me get this
fucking dog out of here!

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:57.352
Joe!

01:05:58.787 --> 01:06:00.955
<i>Joe!</i>

01:06:59.648 --> 01:07:00.782
<i>You busy?</i>

01:07:00.784 --> 01:07:02.984
Come on.

01:07:22.604 --> 01:07:25.673
You got any pets?

01:07:25.675 --> 01:07:28.576
- I mean, I had a cat.
- A cat? Wonderful.

01:07:28.578 --> 01:07:30.445
- What's its name?
- Lucy.

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:33.080
- What'd you feed it?
- I don't know, fucking dry food.

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:36.117
- What's your favorite color?
- Red.

01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:37.985
Blow me.

01:07:37.987 --> 01:07:39.987
All right.

01:07:39.989 --> 01:07:42.924
Let me just focus on the snowflake.

01:07:42.926 --> 01:07:45.726
- Snowflake on the wall.
- All right, snowflake.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:06.047
All right, all right, all right.

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:10.818
- I beg your pardon.
- <i>All right, baby.</i>

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:12.954
It's all right.

01:08:15.724 --> 01:08:17.792
You don't have to run off.

01:08:17.794 --> 01:08:20.127
I mean, you can stick
around if you want.

01:08:21.863 --> 01:08:23.264
Joe?

01:08:27.569 --> 01:08:29.871
Dog.

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:16.716
Pull over. Pull over now!

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:47.148
- Come on. Come on, let's go!
- Freeze!

01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:49.283
<i>Don't move!</i>

01:09:49.285 --> 01:09:50.818
<i>Freeze, Joe!</i>

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:53.888
What? Put the gun down.

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:55.890
Be a man about it
and show me what you got.

01:09:55.892 --> 01:09:58.726
- We got you surrounded, Joe.
- Hey, I'm just one dude.

01:09:58.728 --> 01:10:01.095
Freeze, Joe. Put your
hands behind your head.

01:10:01.097 --> 01:10:02.763
Come on, what are you gonna do?

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:04.231
- Look, I don't have nothing on me, man.
- Freeze.

01:10:04.233 --> 01:10:06.767
Why don't you guys
both be like big boys

01:10:06.769 --> 01:10:08.803
and put your guns down
and let's talk about it?

01:10:08.805 --> 01:10:11.072
That's all I'm gonna do. Just
talk about it, all right?

01:10:11.074 --> 01:10:13.174
Come on. Who's gonna cuff me?

01:10:13.176 --> 01:10:16.010
<i>What do you got?</i>
<i>I'm feeling real good today.</i>

01:10:16.012 --> 01:10:19.714
<i>Hey, Joe. You in there, Joe?</i>

01:10:23.885 --> 01:10:26.921
<i>Coming in, Joe.</i>

01:10:28.156 --> 01:10:30.124
<i>Joe here?</i>

01:10:30.126 --> 01:10:34.061
You seen Joe? Huh?

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:35.796
What you think, man?

01:10:35.798 --> 01:10:37.932
You think Joe is gonna
take care of you?

01:10:37.934 --> 01:10:42.403
You think Joe's your daddy?
Is that what you think?

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:45.006
Joe ain't your daddy.
<i>I'm</i> your daddy.

01:10:45.008 --> 01:10:48.976
I'm the one taking care of you.

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:50.745
You got some money?

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:52.880
I know you got some
money hid around here.

01:10:52.882 --> 01:10:54.382
Where's your money at?

01:10:54.384 --> 01:10:57.218
I ain't got no damn money.
Joe didn't give me none today.

01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:59.120
Really?

01:10:59.122 --> 01:11:00.988
Give me some money.

01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:03.991
I just told you,
I ain't got no damn money.

01:11:08.897 --> 01:11:12.767
Ain't got no money, huh?

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:14.135
Got food.

01:11:14.137 --> 01:11:16.170
Got food, goddamn it.

01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:18.205
You got food, but you ain't
got no fucking money.

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:20.174
How did you get the food?

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:30.151
What the hell you stumbling for?

01:11:30.153 --> 01:11:33.020
You can't even take care
of your damn self.

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:41.862
Hey, that's my shit!

01:11:44.299 --> 01:11:46.367
Knock your shit off, boy.

01:11:46.369 --> 01:11:49.003
Knock your shit off.

01:11:50.906 --> 01:11:54.341
Fuck.

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:57.411
You ain't got no
motherfucking money, huh?

01:11:57.413 --> 01:12:00.181
Oh, hey.

01:12:00.183 --> 01:12:01.949
Look at that, huh?

01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:04.185
What you... oh, yeah!

01:12:04.187 --> 01:12:07.988
Yeah, yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:10.291
That's kind of what
I fucking thought.

01:12:10.293 --> 01:12:14.295
- Bring it, motherfucker.
- Get the fuck back off me.

01:12:19.034 --> 01:12:22.236
How's that, huh?

01:12:23.438 --> 01:12:27.441
Just like that, huh?
Just like that.

01:12:27.443 --> 01:12:29.176
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:31.512
<i>What?</i>
<i>Don't seem to be talking...</i>

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:34.315
doing a whole lot
of talking right now.

01:12:34.317 --> 01:12:37.251
Kinda look like you in bad shape.

01:12:37.253 --> 01:12:39.453
Who the hell you think you are? You
ain't my daddy, you motherfucker!

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:42.957
Look at me! You seen what I did to
that motherfucker on the bridge?

01:12:42.959 --> 01:12:44.525
I'll beat your ass!

01:12:49.064 --> 01:12:50.431
Son of a bitch!

01:12:50.433 --> 01:12:53.400
I'm about through messing with you!

01:12:53.402 --> 01:12:55.402
I been out looking
for fucking money!

01:12:55.404 --> 01:12:57.505
I been out looking
for a fucking job

01:12:57.507 --> 01:12:59.840
to feed your worthless
fucking face!

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:04.011
Yeah. You stupid,
little piece of shit.

01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:11.886
Yeah.

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:14.355
<i>I know you got money</i>
<i>hid around here, boy.</i>

01:13:14.357 --> 01:13:17.391
You know what? I'm gonna come back.

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:19.293
I'm gonna get it.

01:13:19.295 --> 01:13:22.463
I'm gonna find it
and I'm gonna get it.

01:13:46.054 --> 01:13:47.922
Hey, wake it up, wake it up.

01:13:47.924 --> 01:13:50.357
Earl, please, give me
a goddamn cigarette, man.

01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:54.195
Please. I'm begging you.

01:13:54.197 --> 01:13:55.896
You're on your way
out of here anyway, man.

01:13:55.898 --> 01:13:57.598
All right.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.067
- I called your bondsman for you.
- Thanks, buddy.

01:14:00.069 --> 01:14:01.468
How come he's getting out of here?

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:06.307
Aw, knock it off, Cokie!
Knock it off!

01:14:06.309 --> 01:14:09.143
Oh, man, thank you so much, buddy.

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.081
Thank you, buddy.

01:14:21.556 --> 01:14:25.526
- What do they got me charged with?
- Shit, a heap. DUI,

01:14:25.528 --> 01:14:28.996
assaulting an officer, resisting arrest.
You want some more shit?

01:14:28.998 --> 01:14:30.564
Oh, oh... you know
where they took my truck?

01:14:30.566 --> 01:14:32.933
There's a kid who wants my truck.

01:14:32.935 --> 01:14:36.270
Wasn't here last night. We
can sure find out, though.

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:41.275
You were, 32 when you went
to the pen the first time.

01:14:41.277 --> 01:14:43.377
What are you now, 48, 49?

01:14:43.379 --> 01:14:47.081
- 48.
- Getting old, Joe.

01:14:47.083 --> 01:14:51.085
Be a lot harder on you every
time from here on out.

01:14:51.087 --> 01:14:54.588
But who am I to tell you
how to live your life?

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:58.158
Yeah. That's a good one.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.061
Come on, man. Come
on, get it together.

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:03.564
Shit, man. You kidding me?

01:15:03.566 --> 01:15:05.599
Yeah, I'd like to get
a number on a...

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:09.069
like, a dog rescue, or...

01:15:10.138 --> 01:15:13.474
You don't have a number
on a dog rescue?

01:15:13.476 --> 01:15:16.944
Well, I'm reporting a lost dog.

01:15:16.946 --> 01:15:20.948
Yeah. It's an American bulldog.

01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:23.183
Brown and white. Female.

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:25.519
90 pounds.

01:15:33.161 --> 01:15:35.296
What are you doing here?

01:15:35.298 --> 01:15:38.198
Um...

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.000
Mr. Coleman told me

01:15:40.002 --> 01:15:42.937
you got into a little
trouble with some cops.

01:15:42.939 --> 01:15:45.306
That all you heard?

01:15:46.942 --> 01:15:50.044
They said you got put
up at that jail too.

01:15:56.451 --> 01:15:58.552
You don't still want
my truck, do you?

01:16:01.623 --> 01:16:04.158
Yes, sir.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:06.160
You do?

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:15.235
They said you got put up
at the big jail one time.

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:19.206
- Coleman told you that?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:16:19.208 --> 01:16:21.742
Yeah, I have.

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:24.244
I did 29 months in the penitentiary

01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:26.513
for assault on a police officer.

01:16:30.618 --> 01:16:35.356
They pulled me over behind
a shopping center uptown.

01:16:35.358 --> 01:16:37.491
This one officer...

01:16:37.493 --> 01:16:40.494
some pretty-boy type guy...
had some issue with me.

01:16:40.496 --> 01:16:42.596
He thought I had something to do
with one of the girls he knew.

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:45.599
I didn't know what the
hell he was talking about.

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:49.203
<i>Then they tried to shoot me</i>

01:16:49.205 --> 01:16:52.039
<i>after I beat the shit</i>
<i>out of all three of them.</i>

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:55.509
Or one did.

01:16:55.511 --> 01:16:58.479
Deputy went for his gun
and I grabbed it.

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:03.017
And...

01:17:03.019 --> 01:17:06.687
well, he was fixing to kill me.
He told me he was.

01:17:09.224 --> 01:17:13.227
All he did was blow
his kneecap off.

01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:15.329
Jackass.

01:17:17.766 --> 01:17:20.034
My dog run off last night.

01:17:20.036 --> 01:17:21.502
You want to go look for her?

01:17:21.504 --> 01:17:23.404
Sure.

01:17:28.109 --> 01:17:29.576
You want me to drive the truck?

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:31.779
You gotta start sometime.

01:17:31.781 --> 01:17:34.381
Don't look at them.
Don't wave to them,

01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:36.383
<i>'cause they know you're guilty
of something when you wave.</i>

01:17:36.385 --> 01:17:37.546
Yes, sir.

01:17:37.772 --> 01:17:41.188
<i>A cop can mess you
up if he wants to.</i>

01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:45.492
Yeah, I made the mistakes, but they're the
ones that won't ever let me live it down.

01:17:47.495 --> 01:17:49.696
Hey, can I buy one of
them beers off you?

01:17:49.698 --> 01:17:53.367
Oh, I don't know. Uh...

01:17:53.369 --> 01:17:57.204
you can <i>drink</i> one of these beers,
but you cannot buy one from me.

01:17:57.206 --> 01:18:00.307
Friends don't ever need
to buy things from me.

01:18:01.743 --> 01:18:04.378
There you go. Nice and cold.

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:06.246
Keep your eyes peeled.

01:18:06.248 --> 01:18:09.116
For the cops or the dog?

01:18:09.118 --> 01:18:09.618
Both.

01:18:13.122 --> 01:18:15.089
"Cops or the dog."

01:18:15.091 --> 01:18:17.291
You hear that?

01:18:17.293 --> 01:18:19.460
That's the sound that
gets the hookers excited

01:18:19.462 --> 01:18:21.261
'cause they know you got cash.

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:23.263
They hear that...

01:18:26.701 --> 01:18:29.369
<i>♪ You can stay just as
long as you like... ♪</i>

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:31.638
You want to learn how
to make a cool face?

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.440
All right, anatomy of a cool face.

01:18:33.442 --> 01:18:35.609
Make a face of pain.

01:18:35.611 --> 01:18:37.778
Now smile.

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:39.880
No, smile on top of the pain.

01:18:39.882 --> 01:18:42.316
Hold the pain. Smile through it.

01:18:42.318 --> 01:18:43.817
You ain't drunk, are you?

01:18:43.819 --> 01:18:45.486
Shit, I better drive.

01:18:45.488 --> 01:18:48.188
You know what, Gary?
You got it made.

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:49.790
Just think about
all the beautiful girls

01:18:49.792 --> 01:18:51.391
you're gonna fuck.

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:54.128
Now, I used to know a girl
who lived around here.

01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:56.363
Shit. Where's my dog?

01:18:56.365 --> 01:18:58.132
I raised that dog from a pup.

01:19:01.436 --> 01:19:03.737
- Dog!
- There's a lot of construction here

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:05.539
'cause they're building
that Hindu temple.

01:19:05.541 --> 01:19:08.542
Gonna have lots
of "Bombanese" kids.

01:19:08.544 --> 01:19:11.512
<i>Little red dots</i>
<i>in the center of their head...</i>

01:19:11.514 --> 01:19:13.447
<i>like a laser beam.</i>

01:19:13.449 --> 01:19:16.517
- Hey!
- <i>You better work on that cool face.</i>

01:19:16.519 --> 01:19:19.319
You gotta stand like you
on land, all right?

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:22.222
Now you make the pain face, right?

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:24.324
You got a lot on your mind.

01:19:24.326 --> 01:19:28.762
Now smile. Yeah, it's like...

01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:30.864
"I got a lot on my mind,
but I can do it.

01:19:30.866 --> 01:19:33.433
<i>I can get through it."</i>
<i>Yeah, there you go.</i>

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:34.868
Yeah, that's cool!

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:37.538
<i>♪ Well, I'll be ready
in the morning, baby ♪</i>

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:41.408
<i>♪ Mmm, don't you worry a bit ♪</i>

01:19:41.410 --> 01:19:44.645
<i>♪ I got a dry place here,</i>
<i>yes, indeed ♪</i>

01:19:44.647 --> 01:19:46.213
<i>♪ And you can have it all... ♪</i>

01:19:46.215 --> 01:19:48.348
The dog weighs a hundred pounds.

01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:50.751
Has long ears, with a docked tail.

01:19:50.753 --> 01:19:52.486
What was that?

01:19:52.488 --> 01:19:55.189
Yes, ma'am, I meant to get
around to doing that,

01:19:55.191 --> 01:19:57.925
but I did a halfway job on my dog.

01:19:57.927 --> 01:19:59.826
- A halfway job?
- <i>Halfway, ma'am.</i>

01:19:59.828 --> 01:20:03.230
- Well, halfway how?
- <i>Halfway.</i>

01:20:03.232 --> 01:20:06.867
- Hello.
- Hello, hello.

01:20:06.869 --> 01:20:09.403
So, I'm missing my dog,
and the dog is...

01:20:09.405 --> 01:20:10.350
you want some of this?

01:20:10.376 --> 01:20:12.239
No, uh-uh. That stuff
will make you crazy.

01:20:12.241 --> 01:20:14.208
<i>Well, I'm a pretty
long way from crazy.</i>

01:20:14.210 --> 01:20:16.877
<i>But my dog's about 100
pounds, brown and white.</i>

01:20:16.879 --> 01:20:19.813
- Looks like a cow.
- Looks like a cow?

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:21.348
- Right.
- You have a dog that looks like a cow?

01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:22.783
Well, it's not that big a deal.

01:20:22.785 --> 01:20:24.918
A lot of dogs look like cows.
But here's the thing.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.687
If you happen to see my dog,

01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:29.856
no matter what time, you call.

01:20:29.858 --> 01:20:32.626
- Day or night. All right?
- Okay.

01:20:32.628 --> 01:20:35.329
Have we already drove past that
place where you last saw your dog?

01:20:35.331 --> 01:20:38.265
- No. Why?
- I think the dog will be there.

01:20:38.267 --> 01:20:41.235
No, the dog run off.

01:20:41.237 --> 01:20:43.503
If I was a dog, that's
where a dog would be.

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:47.541
That's where I would go.

01:20:47.543 --> 01:20:49.977
- You be careful with him, okay?
- All right.

01:20:49.979 --> 01:20:52.479
- Be careful driving, baby.
- Call me.

01:20:52.481 --> 01:20:54.448
- <i>Okay.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

01:21:00.822 --> 01:21:02.990
<i>♪ Look at me, amazed</i>

01:21:02.992 --> 01:21:04.891

01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:11.031
<i>♪ Yes, you do.</i>

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:15.002
I'll be damned.

01:21:24.612 --> 01:21:27.614
No, wait. Wait, don't.

01:21:29.884 --> 01:21:32.419
Huh?

01:21:33.888 --> 01:21:36.790
Aw...

01:21:36.792 --> 01:21:40.327
- The dog likes you.
- She has a lot of scars.

01:21:40.329 --> 01:21:42.829
<i>Yeah. But all the others...</i>

01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:45.832
all the others is dead.

01:21:58.079 --> 01:22:00.814
Thanks for helping me find my dog.

01:22:00.816 --> 01:22:02.883
<i>Yes, sir, no problem.</i>

01:22:02.885 --> 01:22:05.452
You work hard.

01:22:05.454 --> 01:22:07.454
You got a good heart.

01:22:07.456 --> 01:22:10.023
Anybody messes with you,

01:22:10.025 --> 01:22:12.426
you let me know.

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:14.328
I'll fuck 'em up!

01:22:14.330 --> 01:22:16.863
Right.

01:22:17.865 --> 01:22:20.667
Hey...

01:22:23.738 --> 01:22:25.605
Take it.

01:22:26.841 --> 01:22:28.642
You're gonna need it.

01:22:28.644 --> 01:22:31.111
- No.
- To get girls.

01:22:31.113 --> 01:22:33.980
Huh? See? There you go.

01:22:33.982 --> 01:22:35.949
<i>Okay.</i>

01:22:40.521 --> 01:22:46.493
<i>That's it. You got it.</i>

01:22:50.698 --> 01:22:53.700
- <i>Thank you.
- It ain't anything. Go on.</i>

01:22:57.472 --> 01:22:59.573
I'm gonna take this one
to the opera.

01:22:59.575 --> 01:23:03.610
To the opera, yeah.

01:23:07.715 --> 01:23:09.916
Fuck.

01:23:09.918 --> 01:23:12.919
Aw, shit. I don't have a lighter.

01:23:15.524 --> 01:23:17.157
<i>The numbers from yesterday.</i>

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:19.893
<i>We had a high of 92, officially.</i>

01:23:19.895 --> 01:23:24.064
<i>That's two degrees above the
average of 90 for the day.</i>

01:23:24.066 --> 01:23:26.633
<i>68 was our low.</i>

01:23:36.043 --> 01:23:38.178
<i>Temperatures are concerned.</i>

01:23:39.914 --> 01:23:42.549
You got a light?

01:23:42.551 --> 01:23:44.918
- Yeah.
- Hop in.

01:24:02.970 --> 01:24:06.540
Your boy's a good worker.

01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:09.176
That's the hardest fucking
work I ever done in my life.

01:24:09.178 --> 01:24:11.878
Is it?

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:15.816
- Yeah. You paying my boy?
- What?

01:24:15.818 --> 01:24:18.452
- Are you paying my boy?
- Hell, yeah.

01:24:18.454 --> 01:24:20.587
I ain't seen he got paid none.

01:24:20.589 --> 01:24:22.856
<i>Probably saves it</i>
<i>'cause he's smart.</i>

01:24:22.858 --> 01:24:24.891
Buying this GMC off of me.

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:27.794
Doing what?

01:24:27.796 --> 01:24:30.197
- Nothing.
- Yeah.

01:24:30.199 --> 01:24:34.034
He ain't so smart.
He don't know nothing.

01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:37.938
<i>Hell, neither do you.</i>

01:24:40.908 --> 01:24:43.910
I'm gonna shoot you straight.

01:24:47.582 --> 01:24:51.184
That boy works his ass off!

01:24:51.186 --> 01:24:55.589
He's earning money and it's <i>his!</i>

01:24:55.591 --> 01:24:59.125
If this truck's a piece of shit,
you need to get out of it.

01:24:59.127 --> 01:25:01.862
And if I find out something's
happened to that boy,

01:25:01.864 --> 01:25:05.866
I'm gonna whip whoever's ass
had something to do with it.

01:25:06.868 --> 01:25:08.568
Now get the hell away from me

01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:11.071
before I knock what's left
of your fucking teeth out.

01:25:35.897 --> 01:25:38.732
I had the funniest thought today.

01:25:43.671 --> 01:25:46.072
I thought

01:25:46.074 --> 01:25:49.676
maybe you and I
could go out to dinner.

01:25:51.946 --> 01:25:54.614
You know?

01:25:54.616 --> 01:25:57.050
Get all dressed up.

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:02.289
Maybe you could...

01:26:02.291 --> 01:26:05.091
hold the door open for me.

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:17.337
I think that would be nice.

01:26:22.843 --> 01:26:27.581
You pretend to be asleep, but...

01:26:27.583 --> 01:26:31.084
I know you'd cry if
I said the wrong thing.

01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:59.312
<i>You know this place
is condemned, right?</i>

01:26:59.314 --> 01:27:01.381
<i>You can't just take</i>
<i>the boards off windows</i>

01:27:01.383 --> 01:27:03.950
<i>and call a place home.</i>

01:27:07.388 --> 01:27:11.257
Gary, why do you
stick around like this?

01:27:11.259 --> 01:27:15.228
You're old enough, smart
enough to do your own thing.

01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:16.963
What's most important right now

01:27:16.965 --> 01:27:20.233
is me taking care of
Dorothy and Mama,

01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:25.639
'cause... we kind of got a
family problem right now.

01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:32.412
<i>Hey there.</i>

01:27:32.414 --> 01:27:34.948
Hey now.

01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:37.283
Don't talk much, does she?

01:27:37.285 --> 01:27:41.054
- She don't talk at all.
- What do you mean?

01:27:41.056 --> 01:27:44.758
I don't know. Nobody knows.
She just stopped one day.

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:48.161
I mean, she used to would, but...

01:27:54.969 --> 01:27:57.904
<i>Well, hey, I'm ready to
make this deal if you are.</i>

01:27:57.906 --> 01:28:01.041
- Yeah.
- I got my money.

01:28:01.043 --> 01:28:05.111
Hey, "G-Daawg."

01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:09.315
Don't you think
I forgot about it, bud.

01:28:10.851 --> 01:28:14.721
I've been looking for
you and that kid.

01:28:14.723 --> 01:28:17.023
That boy of yours,

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:19.693
he sure thinks he knows something.

01:28:19.695 --> 01:28:21.394
I know you, mister.

01:28:21.396 --> 01:28:24.230
You my friend?

01:28:24.232 --> 01:28:26.866
I ain't your friend.

01:28:26.868 --> 01:28:29.969
Well, you like to make
all them funny faces.

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:31.404
I said, are you my friend?

01:28:31.406 --> 01:28:34.974
Listen, buddy.

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:36.409
I think I know a way

01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:39.412
that you and me can be friends.

01:28:45.886 --> 01:28:48.855
There it is.

01:28:51.292 --> 01:28:53.493
It looks just like your old one.

01:28:53.495 --> 01:28:55.428
It's periwinkle blue. I like it.

01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:59.032
I hope so.

01:28:59.034 --> 01:29:01.901
Well, you got plenty
of gas to get home.

01:29:01.903 --> 01:29:03.403
You might want to stop at Coleman's

01:29:03.405 --> 01:29:06.039
and put a little more in it
if you plan to ride around.

01:29:06.041 --> 01:29:09.142
- Here.
- What's that?

01:29:09.144 --> 01:29:10.343
It's the money for the truck.

01:29:10.345 --> 01:29:13.146
Oh, hell, I ain't worried about that.
You just stick it back in your pocket.

01:29:13.148 --> 01:29:16.149
You're gonna need it for insurance.

01:29:16.151 --> 01:29:18.852
- What's insurance?
- Well, yeah, it's the law.

01:29:18.854 --> 01:29:20.120
You can't drive without insurance.

01:29:20.122 --> 01:29:23.389
You're covered now, but when I sign it
over, you gotta pick up the insurance.

01:29:23.415 --> 01:29:25.525
I'll tell you what. You come
out to the house before long,

01:29:25.527 --> 01:29:28.194
we'll get you fixed up.
I'm gonna go on.

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:29.462
- You gonna be all right?
- Yes, sir.

01:29:29.464 --> 01:29:30.930
<i>All right.</i>

01:29:30.932 --> 01:29:35.835
- Uh, you want me to follow you?
- Nah, I'll be all right.

01:29:38.272 --> 01:29:40.507
Hey, Joe.

01:29:40.509 --> 01:29:41.808
Thanks.

01:31:05.926 --> 01:31:09.162
- Nice truck.
- Thanks.

01:31:09.164 --> 01:31:11.130
<i>You ain't got any tags on it.
You just get it?</i>

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:12.298
Yeah.

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:13.466
You want to breathe
into this for me?

01:31:13.468 --> 01:31:15.001
No, I don't want to
breathe into that.

01:31:15.003 --> 01:31:16.469
<i>Hey. Hey!</i>

01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:19.072
<i>Hey!</i>

01:31:19.074 --> 01:31:20.874
Hey!

01:31:50.537 --> 01:31:52.538
Pull over!

01:31:53.908 --> 01:31:55.308
Pull over!

01:32:05.085 --> 01:32:07.153
God damn it!

01:32:07.155 --> 01:32:08.554
I ain't done a goddamn thing!

01:32:08.556 --> 01:32:10.423
- Stay in your vehicle!
- <i>I ain't drunk!</i>

01:32:10.425 --> 01:32:12.226
You better look for
someone else to mess with,

01:32:12.227 --> 01:32:14.193
- 'cause I did <i>nothing!</i>
- Put your hands behind your back!

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:15.982
If you and your motherfucking friends
keep messing around with me,

01:32:16.008 --> 01:32:18.631
- I'm going to hurt you!
- Put your hands behind your back!

01:32:18.633 --> 01:32:19.632
Come here!

01:32:22.037 --> 01:32:23.703
I guess if I drive off now,
you're gonna get your shotgun

01:32:23.705 --> 01:32:25.104
out of the back and shoot me, huh?

01:32:25.106 --> 01:32:26.239
- No.
- You gonna shoot me?

01:32:26.241 --> 01:32:28.441
- No!
- You can do it.

01:33:07.114 --> 01:33:09.315
That was quick.

01:33:09.317 --> 01:33:13.686
Still got that badass dog?
Yeah. 'Round here somewhere.

01:33:13.688 --> 01:33:16.123
Hold on a minute.

01:33:17.125 --> 01:33:18.491
Don't worry, okay? Don't worry,

01:33:18.493 --> 01:33:22.595
don't worry, don't worry.

01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:24.664
All right.

01:33:26.367 --> 01:33:30.036
Hear you got a new grandbaby.

01:33:30.038 --> 01:33:31.270
I do?

01:33:31.272 --> 01:33:35.408
- Yeah, you didn't know?
- Not till now.

01:33:35.410 --> 01:33:36.776
Huh. Yeah, a little boy.

01:33:36.778 --> 01:33:39.679
Morrissey saw him in church.

01:33:39.681 --> 01:33:43.616
<i>Said he looked just like
you'd expect him to look.</i>

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:49.122
<i>She said he's got your eyes.</i>

01:33:51.625 --> 01:33:53.159
You okay?

01:33:53.161 --> 01:33:56.095
Your son's all grown now, ain't he?

01:33:56.097 --> 01:33:57.563
Yeah. All grown up.

01:33:57.565 --> 01:33:59.699
What's he going into,
law enforcement?

01:33:59.701 --> 01:34:02.668
That's what I heard.

01:34:02.670 --> 01:34:06.406
You got a new man working
for you now, don't you?

01:34:06.408 --> 01:34:09.642
Yes, I do. Believe you've met him.

01:34:09.644 --> 01:34:12.111
Gung-ho fella. A little overeager.

01:34:12.113 --> 01:34:16.149
- He was looking for someone to fuck with.
- <i>Yeah, maybe so.</i>

01:34:16.151 --> 01:34:18.317
<i>I'll have his ass shuffling
papers for a while</i>

01:34:18.319 --> 01:34:21.254
till he learns to
cool down a little bit.

01:34:21.256 --> 01:34:24.690
But that ain't what
I'm worried about.

01:34:24.692 --> 01:34:27.727
Can you pass the hot sauce?

01:34:30.230 --> 01:34:31.497
Let me ask you a question, Joe,

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:34.500
'cause I really want to know.

01:34:34.502 --> 01:34:36.602
Why do you want to go back?

01:34:36.604 --> 01:34:40.173
Why do you want to go back to
the damn penitentiary, man?

01:34:44.611 --> 01:34:47.413
<i>'Cause you can't keep</i>
<i>going to folks' houses,</i>

01:34:47.415 --> 01:34:50.750
<i>killing their dogs, no matter
what else is going on.</i>

01:34:50.752 --> 01:34:53.786
And you can't keep
fistfighting the law.

01:34:53.788 --> 01:34:55.455
Judge won't put up with it.

01:34:55.457 --> 01:34:57.190
He don't have to put up with it.

01:34:57.192 --> 01:34:59.659
That's why they built prisons.

01:35:05.165 --> 01:35:08.134
Now you done got me back
to smoking, damn it.

01:35:08.136 --> 01:35:09.669
<i>I been quit for three weeks.</i>

01:35:13.108 --> 01:35:15.374
I haven't mistreated you, Joe.

01:35:15.376 --> 01:35:18.377
Have I? Tell the truth.

01:35:18.379 --> 01:35:22.782
No, Earl. You stuck up
for me when you could.

01:35:22.784 --> 01:35:25.852
And I used to be as bad as you.

01:35:25.854 --> 01:35:29.489
At one time, you were worse.

01:35:31.259 --> 01:35:34.660
Yeah, but I'm cool now.

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:48.441
Connie, where'd you go, baby?

01:35:50.410 --> 01:35:53.312
Answer the phone next time.

01:35:57.385 --> 01:35:59.852
Hi.

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:28.714
<i>Yo presiento que Joe está aqui.</i>

01:36:28.716 --> 01:36:32.718
Joe, is that you?
<i>¿Estás aqui?</i>

01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:55.975
Yeah, it's me.

01:37:16.296 --> 01:37:18.397
Oh, shit.

01:37:18.399 --> 01:37:20.266
What happened?

01:37:20.268 --> 01:37:22.702
I need to borrow the truck.

01:37:22.704 --> 01:37:24.971
What happened to you?

01:37:24.973 --> 01:37:26.539
I'm gonna kill him.

01:37:26.541 --> 01:37:29.275
I'm gonna kill that
old son of a bitch.

01:37:29.277 --> 01:37:31.711
You think I won't, but I will.

01:37:33.714 --> 01:37:36.349
And I'ma get mine back.

01:37:37.718 --> 01:37:39.552
I just need to borrow that truck.

01:37:39.554 --> 01:37:40.987
Come inside.

01:37:50.397 --> 01:37:52.298
Don't touch me.

01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:54.000
I should have given you
a boxing lesson.

01:37:54.002 --> 01:37:55.768
I don't need no
goddamn boxing lesson.

01:37:55.770 --> 01:37:58.971
I know what to do. I'll
pop him right in the eye.

01:38:00.407 --> 01:38:03.643
He whupped my ass and
threw me out of the truck

01:38:03.645 --> 01:38:05.544
'cause he knew that
I were gonna kill him!

01:38:09.549 --> 01:38:12.451
I can kill his ass.

01:38:12.453 --> 01:38:14.687
I can kill him just
as good as you could.

01:38:14.689 --> 01:38:17.757
I know you could, I know you could.

01:38:17.759 --> 01:38:19.058
I know it.

01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:21.961
But you don't have to do that.

01:38:21.963 --> 01:38:23.829
Okay, son?

01:38:23.831 --> 01:38:26.866
Just stay here with me.

01:38:26.868 --> 01:38:30.436
You'll be safe here.

01:38:30.438 --> 01:38:32.338
Bring your mama and your sister.

01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:35.574
He gots Dorothy.

01:38:35.576 --> 01:38:37.743
He done run off with her.

01:38:37.745 --> 01:38:39.011
He met up with some bad men.

01:38:39.013 --> 01:38:41.547
I heard him talking about it.

01:38:41.549 --> 01:38:44.417
That man with the
scarred-up face...

01:38:44.419 --> 01:38:47.353
the one that I beat
down by the bridge?

01:38:49.389 --> 01:38:52.558
He been looking for me
for what I done did to him.

01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:56.329
She don't hurt nobody, Joe.

01:38:56.331 --> 01:38:59.332
Should have been me.

01:39:03.403 --> 01:39:06.539
Do you know where they took her?

01:39:08.408 --> 01:39:11.377
Gary...

01:39:11.379 --> 01:39:13.379
tell me.

01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:20.119
- Mm-mm.
- Tell me.

01:39:20.121 --> 01:39:23.089
I just need the truck...

01:39:23.091 --> 01:39:25.624
to get <i>me someplace.</i>

01:39:34.401 --> 01:39:37.370
<i>I'm</i> gonna make trouble.

01:39:43.744 --> 01:39:46.612
Meet me outside.

01:40:51.945 --> 01:40:55.147
$30.

01:40:55.149 --> 01:40:57.883
$30 each.

01:41:21.476 --> 01:41:24.577
Hi. Hi.

01:41:24.579 --> 01:41:25.811
How you doing?

01:41:28.216 --> 01:41:30.483
You okay?

01:41:30.485 --> 01:41:32.718
Huh?

01:41:34.254 --> 01:41:36.555
Tell me something.

01:41:36.557 --> 01:41:38.824
You like funny faces?

01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:16.161
<i>If anything happens to me,</i>

01:42:16.163 --> 01:42:18.697
you get your ass
out of the way, you hear?

01:42:18.699 --> 01:42:20.799
You take my truck and get out.

01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:23.235
- Yeah.
- <i>And go get Coleman.</i>

01:42:23.237 --> 01:42:25.304
Yes, sir.

01:42:25.306 --> 01:42:28.807
Tell him to call Earl.

01:42:49.130 --> 01:42:50.296
Shit!

01:42:50.298 --> 01:42:51.764
Oh, no!

01:42:51.766 --> 01:42:54.266
No, no, no, no...

01:43:00.807 --> 01:43:02.741
- Don't move.
- <i>God damn it!</i>

01:43:02.743 --> 01:43:04.276
I'll kill you both if you move.

01:43:04.278 --> 01:43:05.878
Joe, listen to me. This...

01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:07.179
it ain't what it looks like, man.

01:43:07.181 --> 01:43:08.714
I'm telling you.

01:43:08.716 --> 01:43:11.917
- Dorothy! Dorothy!
- Get her out, Gary.

01:43:11.919 --> 01:43:15.721
Take your sister and go. Go! Go!

01:43:15.723 --> 01:43:20.159
You. I don't know you.
Run, before I shoot you.

01:43:20.161 --> 01:43:23.028
No, no, no, no!

01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:25.331
Joe, listen to me.
Just listen to me, okay?

01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:31.303
Gary! Gary!

01:43:32.706 --> 01:43:34.139
- <i>Gary!</i>
<i>- I'll get help, Joe!</i>

01:43:37.111 --> 01:43:38.677
Please.

01:43:42.048 --> 01:43:46.285
God damn it. That girl, she...

01:43:46.287 --> 01:43:48.354
<i>she don't know shit</i>
<i>about shit, man.</i>

01:43:48.356 --> 01:43:50.756
She's just a piece of trash,
just like her daddy,

01:43:50.758 --> 01:43:52.691
and she's gonna be
doing this shit in no time,

01:43:52.693 --> 01:43:54.727
I'm telling you.
I'm telling you, man.

01:43:54.729 --> 01:43:57.229
Look at the moon.

01:44:17.717 --> 01:44:21.820
God damn it!

01:44:22.889 --> 01:44:25.924
<i>Oh, shit! Ah, fuck this shit!</i>

01:44:28.095 --> 01:44:30.763
If you want to shoot me,
go ahead and shoot me.

01:44:30.765 --> 01:44:32.865
I went through a windshield
and I don't give...

01:45:51.277 --> 01:45:54.012
Are you my friend?

01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:50.996
What have you done, Joe?

01:50:15.141 --> 01:50:17.142
<i>Here's what we do.</i>

01:50:17.144 --> 01:50:19.378
<i>We start a little late,
around 8:00 in the morning,</i>

01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:21.546
<i>and we go till 4:00.</i>

01:50:21.548 --> 01:50:23.382
I pay by the week on Fridays.

01:50:23.384 --> 01:50:27.119
Some days we go long and we
run past 40 hours a week.

01:50:27.121 --> 01:50:29.121
I pay time and a half.

01:50:29.123 --> 01:50:31.223
It's hard work.

01:50:31.225 --> 01:50:33.325
I don't like a whole lot
of standing around.

01:50:33.327 --> 01:50:35.227
We'll probably bust our ass

01:50:35.229 --> 01:50:37.496
and get this spread out
by the end of April,

01:50:37.498 --> 01:50:40.032
get out all
the bare root seedlings,

01:50:40.034 --> 01:50:41.366
and sometimes we stake 'em

01:50:41.368 --> 01:50:43.335
if we gotta keep
the little ones stable.

01:50:43.337 --> 01:50:45.203
Most of the time,
we don't need to mess

01:50:45.205 --> 01:50:48.140
with them little piney
seedlings like that.

01:50:48.142 --> 01:50:50.509
I'm gonna have you join
Donnell and his crew

01:50:50.511 --> 01:50:53.045
on the west end of the farm.

01:50:53.047 --> 01:50:55.180
Then, if everything goes
good on that acreage,

01:50:55.182 --> 01:50:57.082
I'll have you help me supervise

01:50:57.084 --> 01:50:59.551
the Monea project next summer.

01:50:59.553 --> 01:51:03.355
Bastards can be hard
to work for sometimes.

01:51:03.357 --> 01:51:05.590
But, hell, if you worked for Joe,

01:51:05.592 --> 01:51:09.227
I think you'll do just fine.

01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:10.762
You got any questions?

01:51:10.764 --> 01:51:12.531
No, sir. When can I start?

01:51:12.533 --> 01:51:14.232
Right now if you're ready.

01:51:14.234 --> 01:51:17.769
Yes, sir.

01:51:17.771 --> 01:51:21.073
- So you knew Joe?
- Yeah, I sure did.

01:51:21.075 --> 01:51:22.841
Joe was a good man.

01:51:22.843 --> 01:51:25.677
Good man to me, anyways.

01:51:25.679 --> 01:51:28.547
He was a good man to me, too.
