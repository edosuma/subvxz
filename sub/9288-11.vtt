00:12.346 --> 00:17.851
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

00:18.152 --> 00:21.422
My wife and daughter have been kidnapped.

00:21.488 --> 00:25.359
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

00:25.492 --> 00:27.328
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.431
This, is the longest day of my life.

00:50.116 --> 00:51.918
Secret Service thinks the photographer...

00:52.118 --> 00:54.620
...may have been in on
the assassination attempt.

00:54.820 --> 00:57.289
He hasn't been seen since the breakfast.

00:57.823 --> 01:00.126
He was using the name "Martin Belkin."

01:00.326 --> 01:02.628
Follow up and report back
to me in 30 minutes.

01:02.828 --> 01:06.332
I promised Division a threat assessment
on Senator Palmer by noon.

01:06.832 --> 01:09.835
Check with Secret Service.
I don't want any overlap.

01:13.339 --> 01:15.341
- Still no sign of Jack?
- Nothing.

01:50.876 --> 01:51.677
Cofell here.

01:51.877 --> 01:53.278
It's Kevin. Something's come up.

01:53.478 --> 01:54.680
Meet me at the Nordhoff garage.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.383
That's inconvenient, I'm already
on my way to the airport.

01:57.583 --> 01:59.385
This can't wait. Meet me there
as soon as possible.

01:59.585 --> 02:00.886
All right.

02:04.890 --> 02:06.692
Mark, I have a change of plans.

02:06.892 --> 02:10.895
I'm meeting someone in the parking garage
at the corner of Nordhoff and Willingham.

02:17.403 --> 02:18.954
You hear me?

02:23.909 --> 02:25.244
Who are you?

02:27.913 --> 02:28.964
Where's Mark?

02:32.751 --> 02:34.920
What's going on here?

02:36.422 --> 02:38.006
Stop the car.

02:39.925 --> 02:41.343
Stop the car!

03:00.946 --> 03:02.948
Give me the phone through the divider.

03:03.148 --> 03:04.950
Easy. Now.

03:14.960 --> 03:18.297
Get up against the door,
and sit on your hands.

03:18.964 --> 03:19.765
Who are you?

03:19.965 --> 03:21.267
What do you want? Money?

03:21.467 --> 03:24.970
I don't have much with me,
but I'm sure I can find some.

03:25.170 --> 03:26.772
Shut up!

03:26.972 --> 03:30.976
My name is Jack Bauer. Since midnight,
my wife and daughter have been missing.

03:31.176 --> 03:33.479
I have reason to believe they're being
held by a colleague of yours.

03:33.979 --> 03:35.447
A man named Gaines.

03:35.981 --> 03:37.483
Where are they?

03:38.484 --> 03:39.985
I don't know what you are talking about.

03:40.402 --> 03:42.571
Where's my wife and daughter?

03:43.989 --> 03:46.292
For God's sakes, I'm just a businessman.

03:46.492 --> 03:50.496
That's right, an ordinary businessman
riding around in a bulletproof limousine.

03:50.696 --> 03:52.998
- Yes, for protection.
- From what?

03:53.198 --> 03:54.500
People like you.

04:03.008 --> 04:04.760
This is your last chance.

04:05.511 --> 04:08.013
Where is my family?

04:10.516 --> 04:13.519
I swear to you, I don't know
what you're talking about.

04:21.192 --> 04:23.028
You're a very good liar.

04:26.532 --> 04:28.033
But I've seen better.

04:30.536 --> 04:31.453
You stay put.

05:09.741 --> 05:10.876
It's Nina Myers.

05:11.076 --> 05:13.128
Hey, it's me. Can you talk?

05:13.328 --> 05:15.380
Let me open a secure line.

05:20.085 --> 05:20.886
Okay, we're clear.

05:21.086 --> 05:23.589
- Has Teri called back yet?
- No.

05:24.089 --> 05:25.891
What's Green doing?

05:26.091 --> 05:28.093
She's making herself at home in your office.

05:28.293 --> 05:30.896
- She talk to you yet?
- Yes.

05:31.096 --> 05:33.399
I told her I severed all ties with you.

05:33.599 --> 05:35.601
From now on, I play on
the side of the angels.

05:35.801 --> 05:38.070
- Did she buy any of it?
- Not a word.

05:38.153 --> 05:39.198
I've got Cofell.

05:39.398 --> 05:40.406
What do you mean "got"?

05:40.606 --> 05:42.908
I've got him in the back of his limousine.

05:43.108 --> 05:45.110
- Has he told you anything?
- I'm working on it.

05:45.310 --> 05:47.413
In other words, you've kidnapped him.

05:47.613 --> 05:50.015
He's the only link to Teri
and Kim that I've got.

05:50.215 --> 05:52.418
You don't even know if he's
the right Ted Cofell.

05:52.618 --> 05:55.120
Every time I talk to you,
you go further out on a limb.

05:55.537 --> 05:57.623
From the second they were
taken, you tell me one thing...

05:57.823 --> 05:59.625
...I could have done differently.

05:59.825 --> 06:01.427
I don't know, I guess you're right.

06:01.627 --> 06:04.630
But, Jack, I don't know how much
longer I can cover for you.

06:04.846 --> 06:05.898
Nina, please.

06:06.098 --> 06:08.934
Just focus and stay calm,
I need you right now.

06:09.134 --> 06:11.937
Look, I don't think Cofell will be
easy to break. I need help.

06:12.137 --> 06:15.140
You want me to put together an interrogation
profile in what? 15 minutes?

06:15.641 --> 06:17.643
I'll give you about five.

06:17.843 --> 06:18.944
Nina.

06:19.144 --> 06:23.148
If I can't break Cofell, I won't be
able to find my family. Do you understand?

06:23.348 --> 06:24.566
I'll do what I can.

06:24.766 --> 06:25.951
Thank you.

06:26.151 --> 06:28.153
I'm gonna look for a place
to lay low for awhile.

06:28.620 --> 06:30.656
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

06:59.685 --> 07:01.987
Your father will find us.

07:02.187 --> 07:04.990
If he doesn't, the people
that work for him will.

07:05.190 --> 07:07.693
How? They don't know where we are.
We don't know where we are.

07:07.893 --> 07:09.695
They were tracing the call, Kim.

07:11.697 --> 07:14.700
Did they find our location before
the battery went dead?

07:14.900 --> 07:16.702
We have to hope that they did, yes.

07:21.206 --> 07:23.208
Sorry about the... phone.

07:29.715 --> 07:31.717
Thank you for helping us.
We were hoping...

07:31.917 --> 07:33.719
I don't want to know anything.

07:33.885 --> 07:36.221
Trust me, it's better for you
if I don't know anything.

07:36.421 --> 07:38.524
What do you mean?

07:38.724 --> 07:42.227
Eli sent me in here to a get
information from you guys.

07:42.427 --> 07:45.480
But, can't tell him what
I don't know, right?

07:45.680 --> 07:48.734
Whatever's going on, don't tell me about it.

07:50.201 --> 07:52.203
What's he gonna do to you?

07:53.204 --> 07:54.205
Rick?

08:10.721 --> 08:12.723
- What'd they say?
- Nothing, man.

08:12.923 --> 08:14.225
Dude, don't hold out on me.

08:14.425 --> 08:15.526
They don't trust me.

08:15.726 --> 08:18.729
I saw the way that kid looks at you,
she must have said something.

08:19.013 --> 08:20.731
Who was the guy I talked to?
Was it her father?

08:21.232 --> 08:23.734
- They wouldn't say.
- You're lying.

08:26.570 --> 08:27.521
Stop it!

08:29.240 --> 08:30.741
Leave him alone.

08:58.602 --> 09:01.772
I was reviewing the report
on the passenger list.

09:01.972 --> 09:03.274
There was an anomaly in first class?

09:03.774 --> 09:05.576
Yeah, the manifest had been
altered to look like..

09:05.776 --> 09:08.279
...there was an empty seat, but
we don't think there was one.

09:08.479 --> 09:10.281
Who was actually in the seat?

09:10.781 --> 09:12.583
The photographer, Martin Belkin.

09:12.783 --> 09:15.436
So the real photographer
was killed in the explosion.

09:15.636 --> 09:18.113
And the assassin took his
place at the breakfast.

09:18.313 --> 09:20.591
He was enough of a look-alike
to fool security.

09:20.791 --> 09:23.794
And, according to Secret Service, he
had a legitimate ID, not a forgery.

09:23.994 --> 09:24.795
How did he get it?

09:25.296 --> 09:27.298
That, we're still working on.

09:32.303 --> 09:35.106
Myers? Hey, it's me.

09:35.306 --> 09:37.558
Hi, Bill, can you hang on a minute?

09:37.758 --> 09:40.010
It's Bill Warner, at the Bureau.

09:40.311 --> 09:41.612
Shall I call him back?

09:41.812 --> 09:43.764
No, I need to speak to him.

09:43.964 --> 09:45.232
Let me have the phone.

09:46.767 --> 09:48.119
Alberta?

09:48.319 --> 09:50.821
I've got something you should
probably take a look at.

09:51.021 --> 09:54.125
Tell Bill I'll call him later.

09:54.325 --> 09:57.828
The hitter's connection to Germany
may actually lead to the Balkans.

09:58.028 --> 09:58.629
All right.

09:58.829 --> 10:01.332
Our sources say our guy is
probably a Macedonian...

10:01.832 --> 10:02.833
Hey, I'm here.

10:03.033 --> 10:05.136
- Bad timing?
- No problem.

10:05.336 --> 10:06.837
I could have used a few more minutes.

10:07.338 --> 10:10.007
I wish I had them. Give me what you've got.

10:10.207 --> 10:12.676
The guy's flight originated in Croatia...

10:12.876 --> 10:15.179
All right, he's the oldest
of three children...

10:15.379 --> 10:17.648
...his father died when he was a boy.

10:17.848 --> 10:20.351
That means he learned responsibility early.

10:20.551 --> 10:23.137
In college at 16. Intelligent.

10:23.337 --> 10:25.156
First in his class.

10:25.356 --> 10:28.008
Vice-president of a company
three years later.

10:28.208 --> 10:30.861
So he's ambitious, driven,
maybe too much so.

10:31.862 --> 10:32.863
He has a heart condition.

10:33.364 --> 10:34.865
I know, I've got his pills.

10:35.199 --> 10:37.184
He's very organized.

10:37.384 --> 10:39.370
No charities, no...

10:40.871 --> 10:43.174
He's not generous with time or money. Anal.

10:43.374 --> 10:45.876
I'm guessing he's passive-aggressive.
Control freak.

10:46.076 --> 10:47.878
So make him sweat it out for a little while.

10:48.379 --> 10:50.381
Assume control, and then behave erratically.

10:50.581 --> 10:52.916
Yeah, one more thing.

10:53.116 --> 10:54.185
A hunch really.

10:54.385 --> 10:56.887
People this tightly wound,
the threat of pain...

10:57.087 --> 10:59.390
...can be more effective
than pain itself.

10:59.590 --> 11:01.192
Okay, I've got it.

11:01.392 --> 11:02.693
This is all just guesswork.

11:02.893 --> 11:04.895
I could have done more with a little time.

11:05.095 --> 11:06.346
Nina, you did great.

11:06.430 --> 11:08.399
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

11:08.899 --> 11:09.400
Okay.

11:59.950 --> 12:01.952
Get up there! Now!

12:06.957 --> 12:08.959
This doesn't have to take long.

12:09.159 --> 12:10.461
It's up to you.

12:12.463 --> 12:15.048
Do you know a man named Penticoff?

12:15.466 --> 12:17.468
How about Alan York?

12:17.668 --> 12:18.469
David Palmer?

12:18.969 --> 12:21.622
Of course. He's running for president.

12:21.822 --> 12:24.275
The attempt on his life has failed.

12:24.475 --> 12:27.478
The perpetrators will be in custody soon.
You've already been implicated.

12:27.678 --> 12:31.732
If you cooperate with me now,
I might be able to help you.

12:31.932 --> 12:35.986
I can only repeat, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

12:39.323 --> 12:41.558
Your hands are sweating.

12:41.758 --> 12:43.794
Of course, I'm scared.

12:43.994 --> 12:46.497
Who are you meeting on your
way to the airport?

12:46.697 --> 12:48.999
A man named Kevin Carroll.

12:49.199 --> 12:50.000
Who is he?

12:50.083 --> 12:52.002
He's a businessman, like myself.

12:52.202 --> 12:53.304
He sells machine tools.

12:53.504 --> 12:55.789
Why were you meeting him
in a parking garage?

12:55.989 --> 12:58.008
It was his choice, I don't know why.

12:59.009 --> 13:01.011
I told you everything I know.

13:09.520 --> 13:10.521
Hey, it's me.

13:11.021 --> 13:13.524
Run a background check on a Kevin Carroll.

13:13.724 --> 13:16.026
Allegedly a machine tools salesman.

13:16.226 --> 13:17.528
Probably an alias.

13:19.029 --> 13:20.030
Yeah.

13:25.903 --> 13:28.038
Let me show you something.

13:47.057 --> 13:49.343
You ever hear about the Russian gulag?

13:49.543 --> 13:50.361
What?

13:50.561 --> 13:54.064
A string of prisons in northern Siberia.

13:54.314 --> 13:57.568
Russians didn't have a lot of
high-tech equipment up there.

13:57.768 --> 14:00.070
So, they had to make do
with what was around.

14:00.270 --> 14:04.375
Sort of like what I'm doing right now.

14:04.575 --> 14:07.911
You probably don't think that I can
force this towel down your throat.

14:08.111 --> 14:10.714
Trust me, I can. All the way.

14:10.914 --> 14:13.900
Except I hold on to this little bit here.

14:14.100 --> 14:17.087
When your stomach starts to digest it...

14:18.589 --> 14:19.890
...I pull it out...

14:20.090 --> 14:22.893
...taking your stomach lining with it.

14:23.093 --> 14:25.596
Most people could take about a week to die.

14:26.096 --> 14:27.898
It's very painful.

14:28.098 --> 14:30.000
What kind of man are you?

14:30.200 --> 14:32.102
I don't want to hurt you...

14:34.104 --> 14:37.107
...but I will do everything I have
to do to protect my family.

14:40.611 --> 14:43.280
I want to show you something.

14:43.480 --> 14:44.781
It's in my wallet.

14:54.791 --> 14:56.293
Open it, please.

15:01.298 --> 15:05.302
I know you want to see your family again,
and I want to see mine...

15:05.502 --> 15:08.105
...more than anything in the world.

15:08.305 --> 15:12.809
Mr. Bauer, believe me, if I knew
something that would help you...

15:14.311 --> 15:15.812
...I would tell you.

15:51.348 --> 15:52.149
Mr. Drazen.

15:52.349 --> 15:53.650
- Found Bauer?
- No.

15:53.850 --> 15:56.219
But we're doing everything possible.
Scanning police frequencies...

15:56.419 --> 15:57.654
...checking hospitals...

15:57.854 --> 16:00.357
...and I'm still expecting to hear
from my contact inside the CTU.

16:00.557 --> 16:03.026
And if Bauer comes here,
as you suggested earlier?

16:03.226 --> 16:05.662
Then, we'll be ready for him.

16:05.862 --> 16:09.366
For an American operation, we thought
we needed an American crew...

16:09.566 --> 16:12.452
...perhaps we undervalued
our own capabilities.

16:15.372 --> 16:17.674
- I'm pulling the plug on you.
- You can't tell me...

16:17.874 --> 16:20.877
You were supposed to frame Bauer
for David Palmer's assassination.

16:21.077 --> 16:22.379
But Palmer's still alive.

16:22.662 --> 16:24.381
You don't even know where Bauer is, correct?

16:24.581 --> 16:26.383
- No, but I..
- You've failed.

16:29.886 --> 16:32.889
For over a year now, you've been
saying how important this is...

16:33.089 --> 16:34.090
...now you're just gonna quit?

16:34.391 --> 16:35.392
Quit?

16:35.892 --> 16:37.644
Of course not.

16:37.844 --> 16:39.696
We have a contingency plan.

16:39.896 --> 16:42.799
Bauer and Palmer will both be dead
by the end of the day.

16:42.999 --> 16:45.902
You never said anything to me
about a contingency plan.

16:46.403 --> 16:48.188
It doesn't involve you.

16:52.409 --> 16:55.412
Just give me a little
more time to find Bauer.

16:55.612 --> 16:56.713
Until...'til noon.

16:56.913 --> 16:58.915
That's not even two hours.

17:01.418 --> 17:03.720
I'll give you 30 minutes.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.723
If you don't find Bauer by then,
I take over.

17:06.923 --> 17:11.928
Your last task will be to kill his wife
and daughter, and pull your people out.

17:29.446 --> 17:32.949
I like your education program,
but with all due respect...

17:33.950 --> 17:35.952
...I do have one or two suggestions.

17:36.152 --> 17:37.954
Well, that's why I'm here.

17:38.955 --> 17:40.957
I'm not one to say that
teachers shouldn't...

17:41.458 --> 17:43.409
...be accountable for
their performance, but...

17:43.493 --> 17:45.628
Would you excuse me for just a moment?

17:45.828 --> 17:46.963
Sure.

17:54.471 --> 17:55.555
Carl.

17:55.755 --> 17:57.274
Hello, David.

17:57.474 --> 18:00.977
Since you fired me from your staff,
I assume this is a social call?

18:01.177 --> 18:03.980
I need to talk to you, in person.

18:04.180 --> 18:04.814
Why is that?

18:05.014 --> 18:07.984
I got a very disturbing call today,
a little while ago.

18:08.485 --> 18:09.786
Oh?

18:09.986 --> 18:12.989
I was told that George Ferragamo's
life may be in danger.

18:13.189 --> 18:15.292
Who told you that, Frank Ames?

18:15.492 --> 18:19.996
You know what an old lady he is,
just don't pay any attention to him.

18:20.196 --> 18:22.215
I need to talk to you, now.

18:22.415 --> 18:24.859
It's a pretty busy day for me, David.

18:25.059 --> 18:27.504
I know a few things about you, Carl.

18:28.004 --> 18:29.506
Things you don't want spread around.

18:29.706 --> 18:31.508
Are you threatening me?

18:32.008 --> 18:34.811
Is that what it's come
to after all these years?

18:35.011 --> 18:38.014
It's come to whatever it takes to
get you over here now.

18:41.017 --> 18:41.818
Where are you?

18:42.018 --> 18:44.020
Grant Elementary, in the Valley.

18:46.022 --> 18:48.107
I'll be there by 11:00.

19:05.041 --> 19:06.843
- Nina Myers.
- Hey, it's me.

19:07.043 --> 19:09.045
You got anything on Kevin Carroll yet?

19:09.245 --> 19:11.548
Yeah, I show six Kevin Carrolls.

19:12.048 --> 19:15.552
One does in fact work for
a machine tool company.

19:15.752 --> 19:17.303
It's a cover. It's gotta be.

19:17.503 --> 19:18.930
There's another possibility.

19:19.130 --> 19:20.357
Maybe he's the wrong Ted Cofell.

19:20.557 --> 19:24.060
No, he was implicated in Jamey's file,
along with Gaines.

19:24.260 --> 19:25.812
That file was partially erased.

19:26.012 --> 19:27.438
We can't rely on its information.

19:27.638 --> 19:28.865
I think you're making a mistake.

19:29.065 --> 19:31.568
There's something about this guy,
this is not a mistake.

19:32.068 --> 19:37.073
Jack, I know you think he's all you've got,
but maybe that's affecting your judgment.

19:39.075 --> 19:40.577
Okay, thanks.

20:07.103 --> 20:10.106
We're going to see
your friend Kevin Carroll.

20:30.426 --> 20:33.429
It looks like they're getting
ready to leave.

20:34.931 --> 20:36.733
Mom, what's wrong?

20:36.933 --> 20:39.235
It's nothing, honey, I'm all right.

20:39.435 --> 20:42.438
Will you stop saying that,
you're not all right.

20:42.638 --> 20:44.240
- What did he do to you?
- Nothing.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.943
I've been having this pain in my stomach.

20:47.827 --> 20:48.745
How bad?

20:48.945 --> 20:50.780
It comes and goes.

20:50.980 --> 20:52.448
I can manage.

20:53.950 --> 20:56.102
- I should go tell somebody.
- No.

20:56.302 --> 20:58.454
- Mom, you need help.
- I said no.

21:02.458 --> 21:05.962
Your father is coming. Until then,
we have to be strong.

21:10.466 --> 21:11.467
Okay.

22:12.028 --> 22:13.329
Thank you.

22:13.529 --> 22:14.831
How's the food?

22:15.031 --> 22:17.300
Oh, better than what we used to eat.

22:17.500 --> 22:20.419
You two went to the same elementary school?

22:20.619 --> 22:23.539
Oh, we've known each other all our lives.

22:23.739 --> 22:26.042
And still as much in love as ever.

22:27.043 --> 22:28.544
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

22:29.045 --> 22:32.048
I am due at another school, but it's
been wonderful to meet you...

22:32.248 --> 22:34.050
...and all those great kids.

22:34.250 --> 22:34.851
Thank you.

22:35.051 --> 22:37.887
- Would you excuse us a second?
- Of course.

22:43.559 --> 22:46.562
I need to know if you've talked to
Carl since I fired him.

22:48.564 --> 22:50.366
Yes, I have.

22:50.566 --> 22:51.868
What did you talk about?

22:52.068 --> 22:55.071
I asked him if he could find a way
to stop Maureen Kingsley...

22:55.271 --> 22:58.574
...from airing the story about Keith.
He said he would.

22:59.575 --> 23:02.378
What did he say exactly?

23:02.578 --> 23:06.082
As near as I can remember,
something about...

23:06.582 --> 23:09.585
...taking care of the evidence
against Keith.

23:15.591 --> 23:17.393
And you didn't think...

23:17.593 --> 23:19.995
...that was worth mentioning to me?

23:20.195 --> 23:22.598
I wasn't sure what he meant, David.

23:25.601 --> 23:29.105
I'm trying to believe that when
you deceived me seven years ago...

23:29.305 --> 23:31.107
...it was a one-time thing.

23:35.111 --> 23:37.113
This isn't making it any easier.

23:38.614 --> 23:40.616
That is so unfair.

23:47.123 --> 23:48.624
See you later.

23:51.127 --> 23:54.130
I don't know if it's important,
but you asked me to check...

23:54.330 --> 23:56.132
...on Jack Bauer, the guy at breakfast.

23:56.332 --> 23:57.133
Yes. What did you find?

23:57.633 --> 24:00.136
Typical agency file.
A lot of gaps. Classified.

24:00.336 --> 24:02.138
Was one of those gaps...

24:02.638 --> 24:04.640
...in the summer about two years ago?

24:05.141 --> 24:06.642
- How'd you know?
- We'll get into that later.

24:07.143 --> 24:10.062
Right now, we've got other things
to deal with.

24:21.657 --> 24:23.659
Move up to the other seat.

24:23.859 --> 24:24.660
Now!

25:02.698 --> 25:07.036
An average businessman, with a
Microtech Halo in his car?

25:10.206 --> 25:12.208
What did you just say?

25:12.408 --> 25:14.010
Say it again...

25:14.210 --> 25:16.712
...or I'll break your other wrist!

25:17.713 --> 25:19.715
This is not Cofell.

25:20.716 --> 25:22.518
You speak Serbian?

25:22.718 --> 25:24.220
What are you, from Belgrade?

25:24.420 --> 25:26.022
You got family there?

25:26.222 --> 25:28.624
You deserve everything
that's happening to you.

25:28.824 --> 25:31.027
What do you know about
what's happening to me?

25:31.227 --> 25:34.230
There's only one thing that
you need to know, Bauer.

25:34.430 --> 25:35.731
You will pay.

25:38.234 --> 25:39.635
You will pay.

25:39.835 --> 25:41.186
Who are you?

25:41.386 --> 25:42.738
Who are you!

25:54.750 --> 25:57.303
What's the matter? Is it your heart?

26:00.756 --> 26:04.260
I got your medicine right here.
All I want is a little information.

26:04.460 --> 26:07.563
Where is my wife and daughter?
Where is my family?

26:07.763 --> 26:11.267
I'll give you the medicine!
Tell me where my family is!

26:20.276 --> 26:22.244
Take the medicine!

26:31.787 --> 26:32.938
No!

26:33.138 --> 26:34.290
No! No!

26:41.797 --> 26:43.299
No! No!

26:45.301 --> 26:46.602
Please!

26:46.802 --> 26:49.105
Where's my family?

26:49.305 --> 26:51.807
Please, where is my wife
and daughter? Please!

26:52.808 --> 26:54.310
Don't die! Don't Die.

27:18.767 --> 27:21.003
Hey, listen to me, okay?

27:21.203 --> 27:24.807
It's not your fault. There's no way
you could have seen that coming.

27:25.307 --> 27:27.610
How am I going to find Teri and Kim?

27:27.810 --> 27:31.513
The man he's meeting, Kevin Carroll,
maybe he knows something.

27:31.713 --> 27:33.816
If he shows up, he's already late.

27:35.818 --> 27:38.821
Nina, there's something very wrong
about this whole situation.

27:39.021 --> 27:41.123
This is not just about David Palmer.

27:41.323 --> 27:43.475
This is personal, they're coming after me.

27:43.675 --> 27:45.828
What's the connection
between you and Palmer?

27:46.028 --> 27:48.330
- Or you and Cofell?
- I don't know!

27:57.539 --> 27:59.642
Look, this is what I want you to do...

27:59.842 --> 28:02.344
...I want you to dig deeper
into Cofell's background.

28:02.544 --> 28:03.896
Check out his extended family.

28:04.096 --> 28:06.623
I also want you to access
my field assignment files.

28:06.823 --> 28:09.351
- They're classified.
- I know, find your way in.

28:09.852 --> 28:12.855
I want you to check out an assignment
two years ago. I was in Belgrade...

28:13.055 --> 28:13.856
...then Kosovo.

28:14.106 --> 28:16.158
It was called Operation Nightfall.

28:16.358 --> 28:18.861
Now, I want you to crosscheck everything
that you find out from that...

28:19.061 --> 28:19.862
...with Cofell's file.

28:20.362 --> 28:21.864
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

28:22.064 --> 28:23.365
Okay, do it now.

28:28.871 --> 28:32.374
Come on, Jack, come on,
pull yourself together.

29:03.271 --> 29:04.773
Hey.

29:06.274 --> 29:07.492
- What's this?
- Nothing.

29:07.692 --> 29:09.744
Just act like you're interested.

29:09.944 --> 29:12.280
Look, Alberta probably thinks
we're already helping Jack, right?

29:12.480 --> 29:13.782
She can't prove it.

29:14.282 --> 29:17.285
Why don't we just come clean,
tell her what's going on?

29:17.786 --> 29:19.120
Jack says no.

29:21.790 --> 29:24.292
Maybe you should stop
thinking about Jack...

29:24.793 --> 29:27.470
...and start thinking about yourself.

29:27.670 --> 29:30.348
It's Jack's family, so it's Jack's call.

29:30.548 --> 29:32.492
After what happened with Jamey...

29:32.692 --> 29:34.636
...we don't know who we can trust.

29:34.836 --> 29:35.804
All right, come on.

29:36.304 --> 29:38.807
Green may be a hard-ass but I
don't think she's dirty.

29:39.007 --> 29:40.609
I agree. But she does things by the book.

29:40.809 --> 29:43.311
If we tell her what's going on,
she'll call Division. Before you know it...

29:43.812 --> 29:45.814
...there's gonna be 30 people in the loop.

29:48.316 --> 29:50.869
If just one of them is another Jamey...

30:10.338 --> 30:11.339
Kim.

30:11.840 --> 30:14.843
Kim, honey. Wake up. You can't fall asleep.

30:15.043 --> 30:16.845
- Come on. Hey.
- Why?

30:17.095 --> 30:19.347
Because if Dad comes, we might
have to move quickly.

30:19.547 --> 30:21.516
- Come on.
- When we need to move, I will.

30:21.850 --> 30:23.852
- No, Kimberly, come on.
- Mom, I'm tired.

30:24.018 --> 30:25.854
I know you're tired. You've been very brave.

30:26.354 --> 30:28.857
You just have to stay that
way a little while longer.

30:29.057 --> 30:30.859
Kimberly, we can't miss our chance.

30:36.531 --> 30:37.365
Are you okay?

30:39.868 --> 30:40.835
Take it.

30:43.371 --> 30:45.373
It's Dan's, he left it in the van.

30:46.374 --> 30:47.375
It's loaded.

30:50.762 --> 30:52.380
It's all I can do.

30:53.882 --> 30:56.885
You know, I'm sorry about
getting you into this.

30:57.385 --> 30:59.187
Sorry about...

31:00.388 --> 31:02.891
I'm sorry about everything.

31:10.899 --> 31:13.401
What are we supposed to do,
shoot our way out?

31:22.410 --> 31:23.795
They're gonna kill us.

31:24.412 --> 31:25.914
This time they mean it.

31:27.415 --> 31:30.418
Oh, God... no.

31:30.919 --> 31:31.920
No.

31:33.137 --> 31:34.055
Hey.

31:34.255 --> 31:36.925
Kimberly, listen to me, we're alive.

31:37.125 --> 31:38.393
Come here.

31:40.428 --> 31:41.730
We're alive.

31:41.930 --> 31:43.732
As long as we're alive...

31:43.932 --> 31:46.935
...I'm not giving up and neither are you.

31:47.936 --> 31:49.437
Right?

31:51.940 --> 31:53.441
Right.

32:35.984 --> 32:37.786
Sorry I'm late.

32:37.986 --> 32:40.488
I had a couple of calls to make.

32:44.993 --> 32:45.994
Hello, Alan.

32:47.412 --> 32:48.997
Or is it Kevin?

32:53.001 --> 32:54.552
Where's my wife?

34:03.037 --> 34:04.539
I want you to check this out.

34:14.047 --> 34:15.049
Wake up.

34:28.563 --> 34:31.065
- Where's my wife?
- She's safe.

34:31.264 --> 34:33.067
- And my daughter?
- Safe.

34:34.569 --> 34:35.520
Where?

34:41.074 --> 34:44.579
Don't make this any harder
than it has to be.

34:45.079 --> 34:47.081
I was just about to say
the same to you.

34:47.281 --> 34:49.083
But I'm the man with the gun.

34:49.583 --> 34:52.703
If you kill me, how are
you gonna find your family?

34:52.902 --> 34:55.089
Who said anything about killing?

34:59.594 --> 35:01.596
I'm pretty good at withstanding pain.

35:03.097 --> 35:06.601
But if you don't get there
soon, it may be too late.

35:08.102 --> 35:11.606
Since you are no longer
any use to us, Jack...

35:13.608 --> 35:17.111
...there's no reason to keep
your family alive.

35:17.311 --> 35:19.614
So, we need to come to an agreement.

35:23.618 --> 35:25.520
I'm listening.

35:25.720 --> 35:27.422
You let me go...

35:27.622 --> 35:29.624
...I tell you where they are.

35:34.629 --> 35:37.131
As soon as I know they're safe...

35:38.633 --> 35:41.636
...I'll let you go.
You got my word on it.

35:42.637 --> 35:45.139
Your word. That works.

35:47.308 --> 35:50.811
We are talking about my family,
do you understand me?

35:52.313 --> 35:54.115
All I want is to get them back.

35:54.315 --> 35:58.319
So, as soon as I know they are safe,
I will let you go.

35:58.519 --> 36:00.321
That is the agreement.

36:03.324 --> 36:06.127
If I say no?

36:06.327 --> 36:10.164
We'll find out how good you really
are at withstanding some pain.

36:20.841 --> 36:22.126
Drive the car.

36:55.376 --> 36:56.877
Your half hour's up.

36:58.379 --> 37:00.681
Kill Bauer's wife and daughter.

37:00.881 --> 37:03.384
Our contingency doesn't involve them.

37:10.891 --> 37:12.393
Eli!

37:21.402 --> 37:23.904
Tell the drivers to make
their final preparations.

37:27.408 --> 37:28.909
Then kill the women.

37:40.921 --> 37:44.425
I'm well aware that all too often these
days, you have to be surrogate parents...

37:44.925 --> 37:46.227
...as well as teachers.

37:46.427 --> 37:49.930
What can be done about that
at the federal level?

37:52.299 --> 37:54.235
That's a good question.

37:54.435 --> 37:57.438
One that Mike has become an expert
on in the last few years...

37:57.638 --> 37:58.739
...haven't you, Mike?

37:58.939 --> 38:02.092
I've been in charge of preparing
our position paper on education...

38:02.292 --> 38:05.446
...and I've reached some conclusions
I think you'll find interesting.

38:05.946 --> 38:06.747
Wonderful.

38:06.947 --> 38:09.950
Studies have proven that
parental involvement...

38:19.460 --> 38:21.378
What's this about Ferragamo?

38:21.962 --> 38:24.923
What difference does it make,
as long as you're protected?

38:25.123 --> 38:28.085
What difference does it make,
that someone may be murdered?

38:28.285 --> 38:29.970
I didn't say anything about murder.

38:30.254 --> 38:32.765
You didn't deny it, either.

38:32.965 --> 38:35.476
Okay, I deny it. Satisfied?

38:37.978 --> 38:39.280
David.

38:39.480 --> 38:43.484
Power has a price and that price
has to be paid. Always.

38:43.684 --> 38:45.486
Spare me the civics lesson.

38:45.686 --> 38:49.406
I will not permit anyone to be harmed
in any way in the name of my candidacy.

38:49.990 --> 38:52.493
You don't permit or not permit anything.

38:52.993 --> 38:54.995
Don't you understand that by now?

38:57.498 --> 38:59.800
These are very serious people, David.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.503
They didn't put all this time
and money behind you...

39:02.703 --> 39:04.805
...to let things fall apart now.

39:05.005 --> 39:08.008
They'll find someone to do
what they need done.

39:09.510 --> 39:11.345
I can't believe you used to work for me.

39:11.545 --> 39:12.813
I never worked for you.

39:13.013 --> 39:16.016
You and I have have always worked for them.

39:23.524 --> 39:24.525
You maybe.

39:26.026 --> 39:27.528
Not me.

39:38.038 --> 39:40.341
Information. How can I direct your call?

39:40.541 --> 39:44.044
Yes. Give me the number on a
Dr. George Ferragamo.

39:44.244 --> 39:46.547
Just put me through immediately, please.

39:57.057 --> 39:59.009
Dad isn't coming, is he?

40:00.060 --> 40:01.562
I don't know, baby.

40:09.570 --> 40:11.872
I guess your time's up.

40:12.072 --> 40:14.074
Don't worry, I'll make it fast.

40:26.587 --> 40:28.005
No!

41:01.622 --> 41:05.626
Whoever knew he came in to kill
us was expecting two shots.

41:05.826 --> 41:07.628
That was the second shot.

41:09.129 --> 41:10.631
What do we do now?

41:13.133 --> 41:14.635
We hide the body.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.174
Come on.

41:32.653 --> 41:34.154
Turn left here.

41:44.665 --> 41:46.166
Where are we headed?

41:48.669 --> 41:50.504
Where are we headed?

41:52.172 --> 41:54.475
Just drive straight.

41:54.675 --> 41:56.677
I'm taking you to your family.

41:57.305 --> 42:03.864
