WEBVTT

00:11.727 --> 00:14.719
-Oh! Easy.
- Sorry. Your neck is tight.

00:15.022 --> 00:18.935
- It's been a tense couple of days.
- Holidays'll do that to you.

00:19.276 --> 00:21.471
This has been the worst Christmas ever.

00:22.821 --> 00:24.812
It all started yesterday.

00:26.283 --> 00:30.754
The only part about Christmas I don't
like is how quickly it's all over.

00:31.121 --> 00:36.195
Yes. Come December 26th,
it's all just a memory,

00:36.585 --> 00:40.260
with nothing but your light
decorating touch to remind us.

00:42.674 --> 00:44.471
Afternoon, all.

00:45.218 --> 00:49.052
That's awfully dangerous, Daphne,
standing under that mistletoe.

00:49.389 --> 00:51.459
That's enough eggnog, Niles.

00:51.725 --> 00:56.276
The oddest thing just happened. I was
walking past that church on Chestnut,

00:56.647 --> 01:00.435
and Eddie assumed we were going inside.

01:00.776 --> 01:03.244
He did the same thing with me yesterday.

01:03.528 --> 01:07.601
- Any idea why he'd do that, Mr Crane?
- He's always doing weird things.

01:07.949 --> 01:11.862
Yesterday we were taking our bath
together and he spent 15 minutes

01:12.204 --> 01:16.914
pushing the soap around with his nose
like an otter. Weird.

01:18.460 --> 01:23.818
Yes. If he gets any weirder,
we'll have to send Eddie to a home.

01:24.216 --> 01:26.776
I'm off. I have
all my Christmas shopping to do.

01:27.052 --> 01:30.328
- All of it?
- I'm not going to settle this year.

01:30.639 --> 01:33.870
I want my gifts
to be remembered and cherished.

01:34.184 --> 01:37.699
Nothing is cherished quite so much
as the gift of laughter.

01:38.021 --> 01:42.458
You'll have to buy that Highway Patrol
bloopers tape yourself.

01:42.818 --> 01:47.653
You can't drink that that way.
The first mistake in eggnog preparation

01:48.657 --> 01:51.808
is failing to garnish it properly
with a dash of nutmeg.

01:52.619 --> 01:54.610
There we are.

01:57.916 --> 02:01.306
The second mistake is placing
the paprika next to the nutmeg

02:01.628 --> 02:03.619
on the spice shelf.

02:05.215 --> 02:09.174
- Mr Crane, are you all right?
- Yes, we're fine, Daphne.

02:10.429 --> 02:13.865
I'm fine. Frasier, before you go,
can I talk to you for a minute?

02:14.182 --> 02:17.538
- Sure. What is it?
- What Daphne was talking about,

02:17.853 --> 02:21.448
there is a reason Eddie knows that
church. I've been taking him there.

02:21.773 --> 02:24.810
I guess the family
that bathes together prays together.

02:25.110 --> 02:28.819
There's this priest, Father Curtis.
He got to know Eddie in the park

02:29.156 --> 02:31.875
and wanted to use him
for the Christmas pageant.

02:32.159 --> 02:35.231
Next thing I know,
he's roped me in to play a shepherd.

02:35.537 --> 02:40.406
Then Dutch gets bronchitis
and I get promoted to a wise man.

02:40.792 --> 02:44.705
Is there a point to this story
looming somewhere on the horizon?

02:45.047 --> 02:48.084
As a wise man, I have to sing a song
but this song's a killer.

02:48.383 --> 02:50.738
I'm going to humiliate myself.

02:51.011 --> 02:53.809
- You just need a rehearsal.
- You think that'd help?

02:54.097 --> 02:57.134
Sure. You're a good singer.
We'll start around eight?

02:57.434 --> 02:59.629
I am a good singer.

02:59.895 --> 03:04.127
Remember those old family picnics when
I used to belt out <i>What's New, Pussycat?</i>

03:06.902 --> 03:10.338
We'll start around seven then.
Niles, hold the elevator.

03:13.492 --> 03:17.405
Boys, this is that song
I was telling you about. <i>O Holy Night.</i>

03:17.746 --> 03:20.180
- Do you know it?
- Of course. It's a classic.

03:20.457 --> 03:22.846
It all builds to that one glorious note.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.268
Yes, that's the note I can't hit.

03:32.552 --> 03:36.431
I practise it and Eddie ends up
burying his head under the pillow.

03:37.224 --> 03:38.543
We'll get you there.

03:38.767 --> 03:41.884
I want it finished
before Daphne gets back.

03:42.187 --> 03:44.747
If she knows about this,
she'll come to the pageant

03:45.023 --> 03:47.014
and I'm nervous enough as it is.

03:47.275 --> 03:49.505
Let's just see
what we have to work with.

03:49.778 --> 03:52.338
Why don't you start here?

03:52.614 --> 03:55.412
And I want to hear you
really attack the note.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:15.137 --> 04:18.254
Sometimes the note
sees the attack coming and retreats.

04:20.309 --> 04:24.621
Shut up! This bozo upstairs, he bangs
on the floor every time I start to sing.

04:24.980 --> 04:28.734
Ignore him. There is another
vocal exercise I remember.

04:29.067 --> 04:31.979
It was useful to me
when I was singing Colonel Fairfax

04:32.279 --> 04:34.554
in <i>Yeoman of the Guard.</i>

04:34.823 --> 04:39.772
You distract yourself with a physical
exercise, thus freeing the voice.

04:40.162 --> 04:43.120
You hit one note,
then you slide up the octave

04:43.415 --> 04:46.612
as you descend slowly
into a crouched position. Observe.

04:52.799 --> 04:54.517
You see, it works.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.957
That's very interesting.
I wonder if the reverse is true.

05:07.439 --> 05:08.872
Try it, Dad.

05:09.107 --> 05:13.544
No, I'm afraid with three of us
doing it, it might look stupid.

05:13.904 --> 05:15.781
Your problem may be psychological.

05:16.031 --> 05:18.784
No, you're convinced
you can't hit this note.

05:19.076 --> 05:20.873
I convinced the guy upstairs, too.

05:21.119 --> 05:24.236
Niles may be right.
You need reinforcement. Try it again.

05:24.539 --> 05:27.497
Try to eliminate any negative thoughts.

05:27.876 --> 05:31.664
All right, let's go. All right here,
Niles. "Fall on your knees", OK?

05:35.300 --> 05:36.779
You've got it, Dad.

05:38.428 --> 05:40.419
I hear sweet music.

05:45.978 --> 05:47.570
Something's divine.

05:50.774 --> 05:52.207
A star is born.

05:53.527 --> 05:55.518
Bring it home now.

06:02.661 --> 06:04.253
Shut up.

06:07.708 --> 06:12.338
- Your shoulders are awfully tight.
- It's been a stressful few days.

06:12.713 --> 06:15.227
- I'd be happy to listen.
- Oh, no.

06:17.467 --> 06:21.904
Well, it started yesterday.
I had something on my mind.

06:23.098 --> 06:25.851
Lucky for me,
Dr Crane's brother was over.

06:26.143 --> 06:28.373
He's always been
such a good friend to me.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.395
- Afternoon, all.
- Hello, Daphne.

06:32.649 --> 06:36.198
That's awfully dangerous
standing under that mistletoe.

06:36.528 --> 06:40.601
- A piece could fall into your eye.
- Let me freshen your drink.

06:40.949 --> 06:43.827
Thank you, Dr Crane.
The oddest thing just happened.

06:44.119 --> 06:46.872
I was walking Eddie
past that church on Chestnut

06:47.164 --> 06:49.883
and Eddie assumed we were going inside.

06:50.167 --> 06:53.796
He did the same thing yesterday
when I was walking him.

06:54.129 --> 06:57.121
Any idea why he'd to do that, Mr Crane?

06:57.424 --> 06:59.619
Nope. Dogs are weird.

07:05.974 --> 07:08.408
- That worries me a bit.
- What does?

07:08.685 --> 07:12.803
I think your father's been going there.
I had an uncle who did the same thing.

07:13.148 --> 07:16.504
He had no interest in church,
then he started going every day.

07:16.818 --> 07:21.130
He had some bad news from his doctor.
He didn't even last a year.

07:21.490 --> 07:24.562
Well, first of all,
I can see you're upset, so come here.

07:27.871 --> 07:30.863
Thank you, Dr Crane.
You're always so supportive.

07:31.166 --> 07:33.157
You're worrying over nothing.

07:33.418 --> 07:37.934
If my father even had a hangnail,
he'd let everyone know about it.

07:38.298 --> 07:41.768
Maybe I've just got myself worked up
remembering my Uncle John.

07:42.177 --> 07:46.090
Just saying his name gets you upset.
Come here. You need a hug.

07:52.646 --> 07:55.399
Mr Crane, are you all right?

07:55.732 --> 07:57.723
We're fine, Daphne.

08:00.237 --> 08:03.627
See? Nothing to worry about.
Well, I have got to run.

08:03.949 --> 08:07.305
Hold the elevator, Niles.
We'll see you soon, Daphne.

08:07.619 --> 08:10.008
Dad? Don't worry.

08:12.958 --> 08:14.949
Niles and I will be there for you.

08:18.171 --> 08:21.243
- What's that about?
- Oh, never mind.

08:21.550 --> 08:23.506
I've got to go lie down.

08:23.760 --> 08:28.311
Mr Crane, did you call Dr Stewart
for the results of your physical?

08:28.682 --> 08:31.401
Yeah, a couple of days ago.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.515
I'm fine.

08:33.770 --> 08:35.169
Come on, Eddie.

08:38.442 --> 08:41.717
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.

08:42.029 --> 08:44.384
It's just all over so fast.

08:49.828 --> 08:52.023
<i>That convinced me I was right.</i>

08:52.289 --> 08:54.484
<i>And the next 24 hours
were a living hell.</i>

08:55.334 --> 08:57.325
<i>The worst came the next day.</i>

08:57.586 --> 09:01.659
I'm terrified about this, Father.
All this came around so sudden.

09:02.007 --> 09:04.362
I'm not prepared.

09:06.136 --> 09:10.049
T ell me again what I'm supposed
to say when I see Jesus the first time.

09:14.394 --> 09:18.307
OK. All right. Well, thank you.
Yeah, I'll see you soon. Bye.

09:19.941 --> 09:20.930
Hi, Daphne.

09:21.652 --> 09:22.880
Hello.

09:24.571 --> 09:27.483
I'm so excited about the gift
I just got for you.

09:27.783 --> 09:31.219
- Great.
- Why don't you open it now?

09:31.536 --> 09:35.654
To tell you the truth, I don't have
much time. I'm kind of on my way out.

09:35.999 --> 09:39.787
Wait, OK, all right.
I'll open it now. Sure, sure.

09:40.128 --> 09:44.121
Don't want to get you upset.
You must be really excited about this.

09:44.466 --> 09:48.823
Wow. It's that sweater. The one
I pointed out to you in the window.

09:49.179 --> 09:52.808
It's great.
I can die a happy man now.

09:54.434 --> 09:56.743
What's the matter? Are you all right?

09:57.562 --> 10:01.874
Mr Crane, I know why you've been going
down to that church.

10:02.234 --> 10:06.227
You're not supposed to know about that.
But why is it making you so upset?

10:06.571 --> 10:08.562
I care about you.

10:08.824 --> 10:12.100
You were going to let this happen
without telling a soul?

10:12.411 --> 10:15.289
I don't want people staring at me
in that church,

10:15.580 --> 10:18.014
stiff as a board,
all that make-up on my face.

10:22.963 --> 10:25.921
So how much time have you got?

10:27.009 --> 10:29.000
About 20 minutes.

10:30.971 --> 10:34.202
- 20 minutes?
- Yeah. Will I be glad when it's over.

10:34.516 --> 10:37.314
This is the last Christmas pageant
I'm signing up for.

10:37.602 --> 10:41.072
- You're in a Christmas pageant?
- Yeah. What'd you think?

10:41.398 --> 10:43.673
- I thought you were dying.
- What?

10:43.942 --> 10:48.015
You just got your test results back,
you're at the church all the time.

10:48.363 --> 10:50.558
- Why are you laughing?
- That's funny.

10:51.033 --> 10:53.911
- I don't think it's so bloody funny.
- Are you kidding?

10:54.202 --> 10:56.238
- I'm dying.
- You will be.

10:56.496 --> 11:00.409
- Daphne, don't do that.
- Don't you tell me what to do.

11:00.751 --> 11:04.187
What kind of house were you
brought up in anyway for God's sake?

11:11.595 --> 11:13.711
You can talk about it if you like.

11:14.598 --> 11:16.987
I'm not ready just yet.

11:23.815 --> 11:27.125
I can't tell you how good that feels.

11:27.444 --> 11:30.402
I don't think I've ever
had a massage like this before.

11:30.697 --> 11:34.007
Well, I'm glad.
As long as you're so relaxed,

11:34.326 --> 11:37.557
maybe I should give you
your Christmas present right now.

11:43.960 --> 11:44.949
Ow!

11:45.337 --> 11:46.850
You woke me up.

11:47.089 --> 11:49.319
Sorry.
I guess this ankle's a bit tender.

11:51.009 --> 11:54.604
Yours would be, too,
if you'd had the day I had.

11:54.930 --> 11:59.128
<i>I'd gone out to do some shopping.
Then I arrived at Frasier's building.</i>

11:59.476 --> 12:02.070
I'm sorry, I don't mean to crowd you.

12:02.354 --> 12:05.232
This is a brand-new,
hand-tailored Italian suit.

12:05.524 --> 12:07.879
It's difficult to get sap out of silk.

12:08.151 --> 12:10.426
Another reason we didn't need this tree.

12:11.947 --> 12:13.938
This thing's a fire hazard.

12:14.574 --> 12:17.884
They make a chemical now
that you can use to fireproof a tree.

12:18.328 --> 12:20.603
It causes cancer.

12:20.872 --> 12:23.386
Happy holidays, then.

12:24.543 --> 12:28.058
- What just happened?
- I think the elevator stopped.

12:28.380 --> 12:30.496
I'm sure we'll get it going in a moment.

12:30.757 --> 12:34.193
We've probably got about 20 minutes
of oxygen.

12:35.220 --> 12:38.417
- Sir, you're going to alarm everyone.
- I work in an ER.

12:38.724 --> 12:42.000
Perhaps you can instruct us
on how to stay cool in a crisis.

12:42.311 --> 12:46.145
I was on duty when the elevator cable
snapped at the Bing building.

12:46.481 --> 12:49.553
They brought those people in
on cookie sheets.

12:52.321 --> 12:54.312
Hello? Is anyone there?

12:54.573 --> 12:55.847
<i>Yeah, who is it?</i>

12:56.074 --> 12:58.190
We're stuck in one of your elevators.

12:58.452 --> 13:01.762
The doors won't open and we're stuck.

13:02.080 --> 13:05.231
- <i>Where are you calling from, sir?</i>
- Elliott Bay Towers.

13:05.542 --> 13:09.330
<i>It could be an hour and a half
before anybody gets there.</i>

13:09.671 --> 13:12.822
My children are alone
upstairs in the apartment.

13:13.133 --> 13:16.170
Haven't got a gas oven up there,
have you?

13:17.638 --> 13:21.153
<i>If somebody climbed through
the trap door on top of your car,</i>

13:21.475 --> 13:25.593
<i>there's a manual release switch
up there that would open up your doors.</i>

13:25.937 --> 13:31.648
- Somebody's got to go up there.
- That's a pretty small opening.

13:32.069 --> 13:36.506
I have more confidence in your wife
than you do. I'll give you a leg up.

13:36.865 --> 13:39.299
It has to be you.

13:41.203 --> 13:43.717
- How do I get up there?
- Climb up the tree.

13:43.997 --> 13:45.032
Oh, come on.

13:45.248 --> 13:47.808
Surely you climbed trees
when you were a boy.

13:48.085 --> 13:50.076
That's Dr Crane's brother.

13:55.217 --> 13:56.206
Fine.

13:57.552 --> 14:00.703
I suppose in times of crisis,
someone must be a hero.

14:01.014 --> 14:06.930
Today that man is Niles Crane. Tomorrow,
it will be my dry-cleaner, Mr Li.

14:11.900 --> 14:14.778
Grab his feet
and we'll push him through.

14:15.070 --> 14:17.061
Not so fast.

14:18.031 --> 14:21.148
Not to worry. I have landed
in a nice soft puddle of grease.

14:23.078 --> 14:25.911
I just have to find the release switch.
Bear with me.

14:28.166 --> 14:30.760
- Quick.
- Did that do anything?

14:32.629 --> 14:33.618
People?

14:35.048 --> 14:37.039
Lady with my coat?

14:39.886 --> 14:41.285
Where did you all go?

14:45.350 --> 14:48.183
Oh, my God.
We're going up! Someone stop this thing!

15:00.324 --> 15:03.361
- Why is that man crawling?
- That's Dr Crane's brother.

15:05.370 --> 15:07.361
<i>I was shaken by what I had done.</i>

15:07.622 --> 15:11.137
<i>But I had composed myself
as I arrived at Frasier's.</i>

15:12.085 --> 15:15.600
<i>It was some time later before
I was able to say what had happened.</i>

15:15.922 --> 15:19.471
I have no idea what you use
to get elevator grease out of silk.

15:19.801 --> 15:22.679
Brown suede
seems to be leeching it out nicely.

15:25.891 --> 15:29.042
Anyway, no Christmas is complete
without a bit of tumult.

15:29.353 --> 15:33.028
But now we can all relax and enjoy
a lovely holiday evening together.

15:33.357 --> 15:34.870
Merry Christmas!

15:39.446 --> 15:42.244
- You sure you want to hear about this?
- Why not?

15:42.532 --> 15:45.126
OK. I've been feeling depressed

15:45.410 --> 15:48.720
because I'm putting on
all this weight. I'm pregnant.

15:49.039 --> 15:51.075
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Roz.

15:51.333 --> 15:54.086
- That's a nice suit.
- Thank you. It's brand-new.

15:54.378 --> 15:56.573
And since you'll be ordering food,

15:56.838 --> 16:00.717
I will go
rather than risk getting it stained.

16:01.051 --> 16:04.202
Is that some kind of crack
about how much I eat?

16:04.513 --> 16:07.550
Absolutely not. It's a crack
about your table manners.

16:08.684 --> 16:11.756
I should go. I've got a couple
of hours before the pageant.

16:12.062 --> 16:16.180
- And I need the time to rehearse.
- Come tomorrow, it'll all be a memory.

16:16.525 --> 16:21.360
But even after it's over, I still have
to make peace with the man upstairs.

16:22.864 --> 16:27.142
Are you sure we have
to do this charity thing this afternoon?

16:27.494 --> 16:30.452
Come on, Roz, it's just an hour
out of your life.

16:30.747 --> 16:33.022
You'll make an adorable Mrs Claus.

16:33.291 --> 16:36.328
Why? Because now I've gotten so fat?

16:41.008 --> 16:44.398
Hello. Why, yes, Mrs Doyle, yes, she is.

16:44.720 --> 16:47.518
Just a moment.
They forwarded her from the office.

16:47.806 --> 16:51.162
Hello, Mom? Yes, I got your message.

16:52.269 --> 16:55.341
Yep, I'm picking you up
at the airport, 10am.

16:55.647 --> 16:57.638
Looking forward to seeing you, too.

16:57.899 --> 17:00.333
- Let me say Merry Christmas.
- Hang on, Mom.

17:00.610 --> 17:02.885
Mrs Doyle.
Hi, happy holidays.

17:03.155 --> 17:05.544
Just a word to the wise.

17:05.824 --> 17:08.384
Roz has put on quite a few
pregnancy pounds of late

17:08.660 --> 17:10.810
and she's really sensitive about it.

17:11.079 --> 17:13.912
I would be careful
what you say to her, all right?

17:14.207 --> 17:16.641
Bye-bye. We'll see you soon. Bye.

17:18.211 --> 17:20.964
I'll meet you over there.
I still have gifts to get.

17:21.256 --> 17:24.726
I still have all of mine to get.
No matter how hard I try,

17:25.051 --> 17:28.442
I can't seem find anything
that seems right this year.

17:28.764 --> 17:32.757
It's really sweet how you're trying
so hard to make all your gifts special.

17:33.101 --> 17:37.060
I'm sorry I've been so cranky.
I'm just nervous about my mom coming.

17:37.397 --> 17:41.436
I'm dreading the big conversation
where I finally tell her I'm pregnant.

17:49.910 --> 17:52.549
- You haven't told her yet?
- No.

17:52.829 --> 17:56.378
It's just not the type of thing
you blurt out over the phone.

17:58.669 --> 18:01.183
I'll let you get that.
I'll see you over there.

18:03.131 --> 18:06.680
Hello? Yes, I had a feeling
you might call back.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.711
I was beginning to worry about you.

18:10.973 --> 18:15.808
I'm on the verge of a complete
breakdown. Shopping was a disaster.

18:16.186 --> 18:19.622
When I went to slip into this darling
costume, my pants split.

18:20.649 --> 18:24.358
And I can't stop thinking about my mom.
How am I going to tell her?

18:24.903 --> 18:29.533
- If you'd like, I can tell her for you.
- She'll be mad I waited three months.

18:29.908 --> 18:32.820
It'd be worse
hearing it from someone else.

18:33.120 --> 18:35.509
- It's possible she already knows.
- No way.

18:35.789 --> 18:40.419
The only person who knows she's spoken
to is you. Oh, my God. Frasier.

18:40.794 --> 18:42.864
OK. Who's first?

18:43.880 --> 18:45.950
I'm going to kill you.

18:46.216 --> 18:50.448
- You're going to kill Santa?
- No, Mrs Claus just wants to kiss me.

18:50.804 --> 18:54.114
Yeah, I'll kiss you. Come here.
I'll kiss you good.

18:56.184 --> 18:58.823
Here, run along. Are you insane?

18:59.104 --> 19:02.733
Roz, you tell your mother everything.
How was I supposed to know?

19:03.066 --> 19:05.580
Hi, Santa. I want a pony for Christmas.

19:05.861 --> 19:08.216
You got it. Now beat it.

19:08.488 --> 19:10.365
- Can't we talk about this later?
- No.

19:10.615 --> 19:11.604
Hi, Santa.

19:11.825 --> 19:15.056
Oh, my God, what are you, 20?
Get out of here.

19:15.370 --> 19:17.361
Try to stay calm.

19:17.622 --> 19:21.934
No, I will not stay calm, because
I am not calm. I am completely freaked.

19:22.294 --> 19:24.603
I am pregnant, and you
told my crazy mother,

19:24.880 --> 19:30.398
and I'm too fat to even be Mrs Santa.
And I hate this holiday.

19:34.514 --> 19:37.233
Mrs Claus was up very late last night.

19:38.727 --> 19:43.039
<i>I still had to stop by Frasier's.
I had to give him his champagne glasses.</i>

19:43.565 --> 19:45.044
Merry Christmas!

19:46.443 --> 19:50.231
Roz, don't go. I'm sorry about
what happened, but it was a mistake.

19:50.572 --> 19:54.087
- You can't stay mad at me.
- I have to face my mother tomorrow.

19:54.409 --> 19:58.197
We can talk about that.
Come on in. Please, come in.

19:58.538 --> 20:01.848
How would it look if I turned
a pregnant lady out on Christmas Eve

20:02.167 --> 20:04.317
when there's so much room
here at the inn?

20:05.462 --> 20:08.022
Niles, Daphne, Roz is here.

20:08.298 --> 20:10.129
- Hi.
- Hello.

20:10.384 --> 20:14.980
Come on, people. Let's liven things up
a little. It's Christmas Eve.

20:15.347 --> 20:19.022
What are the Cranes known for
if not their legendary holiday spirit?

20:19.351 --> 20:22.741
I hate singing, and I hate Christmas,
and I'm going to bed.

20:24.398 --> 20:25.547
Dad, what happened?

20:25.774 --> 20:29.210
I went into my song
and we come up to the high note

20:29.528 --> 20:31.678
and I think
I'm going to hit it for once.

20:31.947 --> 20:37.180
Then I see Eddie with his head
buried in the Christ child's cradle.

20:38.370 --> 20:40.930
He mistook the Christ child
for a chew toy

20:41.206 --> 20:43.640
and grabs hold of it
and starts shaking it.

20:43.917 --> 20:46.636
So, the Virgin Mary
grabs hold of one of his legs.

20:46.920 --> 20:49.798
Eddie loves a good tug of war,
so they're going at it.

20:50.090 --> 20:55.483
Then Eddie goes running out with
half of Bethlehem chasing after him.

20:55.887 --> 20:57.878
I never should have agreed to do it.

20:58.140 --> 21:01.098
- You'd have saved me grief.
- Don't start this again.

21:01.393 --> 21:05.068
- Don't you talk to her like that.
- Let's not say something we'll regret.

21:05.397 --> 21:09.276
- You're one to talk.
- Roz, I know it's hard to forget...

21:11.903 --> 21:13.894
All right! That is enough!

21:15.032 --> 21:18.069
This is the night we celebrate peace
and togetherness!

21:18.410 --> 21:20.640
I will not have that ruined!

21:27.461 --> 21:30.498
I intend to put us all
in the right frame of mind

21:31.798 --> 21:34.358
by giving you all my gift.

21:35.010 --> 21:38.923
I was determined to make my gift
this year a little more meaningful,

21:39.264 --> 21:42.620
and after a great deal of effort,
I believe I have.

21:42.934 --> 21:47.485
My gift does not come from some fancy
store, all wrapped in glittery paper.

21:48.982 --> 21:51.576
My gift comes from my heart.

21:52.903 --> 21:56.782
Tonight I intend to sit each one of you
down and tell you in my own words

21:57.741 --> 22:00.335
exactly how much you mean to me.

22:02.162 --> 22:06.314
That's it? Are you out of your mind?

22:06.667 --> 22:09.420
Or I could get someone over
to give us all massages.

22:09.711 --> 22:11.064
Great!

22:12.589 --> 22:13.942
I'm so tense!

22:14.305 --> 22:20.175
