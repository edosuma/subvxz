WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:03.571
Good morning, Pam.

00:03.604 --> 00:05.506
Oh, welcome back, Andy.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.775
Drew.
I'm Drew now.

00:07.808 --> 00:09.510
Oh...Drew.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.045
Sorry.

00:11.079 --> 00:14.182
Apology not accepted.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.150
Because it wasn't
even necessary

00:16.184 --> 00:18.119
in the first place.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.720
Several weeks ago,

00:19.753 --> 00:22.390
Andy Bernard
had an incident.

00:22.423 --> 00:23.391
Gaaah!

00:23.424 --> 00:24.725
Ohh!

00:24.758 --> 00:27.795
But after five weeks
in anger management,

00:27.828 --> 00:28.796
I'm back.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.664
And I've got a new attitude.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.566
And a new name.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.336
And...a bunch
of new techniques

00:35.369 --> 00:36.837
for dealing
with the grumpies.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.739
Morning, Jim.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.474
Hey, Andy.
How are you, man?

00:40.508 --> 00:42.543
Good. Drew.

00:42.576 --> 00:43.611
What's that?

00:43.644 --> 00:45.179
You can call me Drew.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.081
No, I'm not gonna
call you that.

00:47.881 --> 00:48.849
Cool.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.384
I can't control
what you do.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.820
I can only control
what I do.

00:52.853 --> 00:53.854
Andy.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.689
Drew.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.192
Dwight.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.662
How's it going, man?

01:03.131 --> 01:05.466
Yes, I have decided
to shun Andy Bernard

01:05.499 --> 01:06.867
for the next three years.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.103
Which I'm looking forward to.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.871
It's an Amish technique.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.107
It's like slapping someone
with silence.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.475
I was shunned
from the age of four

01:14.508 --> 01:15.576
until my sixth birthday

01:15.609 --> 01:18.812
for not saving the excess oil
from a can of tuna.

01:18.846 --> 01:22.116
Jim, could you please
inform Andy Bernard

01:22.150 --> 01:24.452
that he is being shunned.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.220
Andy, Dwight says
welcome back,

01:26.254 --> 01:27.821
and he could use a hug.

01:27.855 --> 01:30.158
Okay, tell him
that that's not true.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.559
Dwight says that he actually
doesn't know

01:31.592 --> 01:33.227
one single fact
about bear attacks.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.295
Okay, no, Jim...
You guys.

01:34.328 --> 01:37.765
tell him bears can climb
faster than they can run.

01:37.798 --> 01:38.832
Jim!

01:38.866 --> 01:40.768
Tell him!

01:40.801 --> 01:42.570
Andy...
Nah, that's too far.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.638
Damn you.

01:44.672 --> 01:47.608
[piano rock]

01:47.641 --> 01:56.650
*

02:05.426 --> 02:09.197
(Michael)
Today is safety training day.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.399
Toby is leading ours
upstairs.

02:11.432 --> 02:12.400
Yuck.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.668
But I am giving everyone

02:14.702 --> 02:16.370
a little bit of a treat.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.439
We are going to listen in
on Darryl's presentation

02:18.472 --> 02:19.407
to the warehouse.

02:19.440 --> 02:23.211
And if I know Darryl,
it gonna be zoppity.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.878
Now...

02:24.912 --> 02:27.415
this is the forklift.

02:27.448 --> 02:28.816
You need--you need

02:28.849 --> 02:31.619
a license to operate
this machine.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.355
That means the upstairs
office workers can't drive it.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.756
Quiz. Mike.

02:35.789 --> 02:36.890
Hmm?

02:36.924 --> 02:37.925
Should you drive
the forklift?

02:37.958 --> 02:38.826
I can, and I have.

02:38.859 --> 02:39.827
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

02:39.860 --> 02:40.861
I said should you?

02:40.894 --> 02:42.630
You should not drive it.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.332
You should not
drive the forklift.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.833
You understand?
You're now allowed
to drive the forklift.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.468
It's not safe.
You don't have a license.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.937
Guys, I'm not the only one
who's driven the forklift.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.605
Pudge has driven
the forklift.

02:51.639 --> 02:52.906
Madge.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.508
I thought your name
was Pudge.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.344
No, it's always
been Madge.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.911
Okay.

02:57.945 --> 02:58.979
Um, her.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.649
Her, yes, "her"
is qualified

03:01.682 --> 03:02.850
to work
a dangerous machine.

03:02.883 --> 03:03.884
You are not.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.553
Okay?

03:05.586 --> 03:06.687
Ah...fine.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.721
Do you
understand that?

03:07.755 --> 03:08.722
Yesh.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.691
(Darryl)
We do safety training
every year.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.693
Or after an accident.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.396
We've never made it
a full year.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.864
This particular time,

03:16.897 --> 03:19.900
I was reaching for a supply box
on the top shelf,

03:19.933 --> 03:24.572
when one office worker
who shall remain nameless

03:24.605 --> 03:27.341
kicked the ladder out
from under me and yelled...

03:27.375 --> 03:28.909
"Hey, Darryl,
how's it hangin'?"

03:28.942 --> 03:30.811
[laughing]

03:30.844 --> 03:33.514
And I fell
and busted my ankle and...

03:33.547 --> 03:36.250
I'm legitimately scared
for my workers.

03:36.284 --> 03:40.020
The bailer can flatten
a car engine.

03:40.053 --> 03:43.557
It can cut off your arm
and crush your entire body

03:43.591 --> 03:44.658
without skipping a beat.

03:44.692 --> 03:45.926
Yeah!

03:45.959 --> 03:46.827
It's on.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.330
How many people a year
do you think

03:49.363 --> 03:50.964
get their arms cut off
in a bailer?

03:50.998 --> 03:52.866
Bail 'er?
I hardly know her.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.435
Damn it, Michael,
pay attention, man.

03:54.468 --> 03:55.869
Anybody wanna
take a guess?

03:55.903 --> 03:57.871
Five bucks
says it's over 50.

03:57.905 --> 03:58.872
You really wanna bet?

03:58.906 --> 03:59.940
Anybody?

03:59.973 --> 04:01.275
Ever since
March Madness ended,

04:01.309 --> 04:02.776
I am so bored.

04:02.810 --> 04:03.877
How many?
Okay, you're on.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.879
Ten people, Michael.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.381
Ten people.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.682
Would you like
to be one of them?

04:08.716 --> 04:09.783
No, don't worry about it.

04:09.817 --> 04:10.951
We'll just go
double or nothing.

04:10.984 --> 04:11.919
On what?

04:11.952 --> 04:12.720
I don't know.
We'll figure something out.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.788
What are you guys
talking about?

04:14.822 --> 04:17.391
These are very dangerous
machines down here.

04:17.425 --> 04:20.961
And the upstairs workers,
Michael...

04:20.994 --> 04:22.963
should not go
anywhere near them.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.031
Yes, yes.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.833
But it wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world--

04:25.866 --> 04:27.568
It would be the worst thing
in the world, it would!

04:27.601 --> 04:29.370
What the hell
is wrong with this man?

04:29.403 --> 04:30.938
It's a big, red
trash compactor.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.873
It's not a trash compactor!

04:32.906 --> 04:34.007
It's a bailer.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.076
Okay, I got it!
I got it!

04:36.109 --> 04:37.945
Only on the rarest
of occasions--

04:37.978 --> 04:39.713
No, do not touch it!

04:39.747 --> 04:41.915
There is no occasion for you
to go near this stuff, okay?

04:41.949 --> 04:45.353
Toby now has the floor.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.821
And he is going to try
not to screw this up.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.923
Like everything else
in his life.

04:51.058 --> 04:51.992
Let me rephrase that.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.628
I believe that you can do
safety training

04:54.662 --> 04:56.864
and make it sound
just as good as Darryl.

04:57.865 --> 05:00.067
Here we go!

05:00.100 --> 05:02.803
Okay, um...one thing
you're gonna wanna look out for

05:02.836 --> 05:03.904
is carpal tunnel syndrome.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.606
It's recommended
that you take

05:05.639 --> 05:07.708
a ten-minute break
from typing every hour.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.943
For your circulation, um,

05:09.977 --> 05:11.479
you're gonna wanna get up
out of your chairs,

05:11.512 --> 05:14.081
and, uh, and move around
about ten minutes every hour.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.983
Yes, good, fine.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.585
Like stretching and...

05:17.618 --> 05:18.752
Um...yeah.

05:18.786 --> 05:19.887
Your computer screen

05:19.920 --> 05:21.922
can be a big strain
on your eyes.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.825
So it's also recommended
that you step away

05:24.858 --> 05:26.960
for about--about
ten minutes every hour.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.363
Wow, that is--
that time really adds up.

05:29.397 --> 05:31.765
That's like a half an hour
every hour.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.901
Take them
at the same time.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.002
Okay, you know what?

05:35.035 --> 05:36.637
You're making it
sound kind of lame.

05:36.670 --> 05:40.040
So skip ahead to the really
dangerous stuff.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.943
Like sometimes,
computers can explode.

05:42.976 --> 05:43.977
Can they not?

05:44.011 --> 05:45.012
No, no.

05:45.045 --> 05:49.082
Um, you always want
to keep a sweater or cardigan

05:49.116 --> 05:51.619
of some sort
in case it gets drafty.

05:51.652 --> 05:52.886
What about
a long-sleeved tee?

05:52.920 --> 05:53.887
Well, that'll work.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.489
(Kevin)
Long johns? A shawl?

05:55.523 --> 05:56.924
(Toby)
You know, anything
that warms you.

05:56.957 --> 05:57.858
(Michael)
Okay, you know what?

05:57.891 --> 05:59.960
I think that everybody
is going to vomit

05:59.993 --> 06:01.094
due to boredom.

06:01.128 --> 06:04.064
Sorry, he is very lame.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.967
Um...let's see.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.869
Seasonal affective disorder.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.904
"A depression
that includes weight gain,

06:10.938 --> 06:12.606
"fatigue, irritability,

06:12.640 --> 06:15.008
brought on by the low light
of winter."

06:15.042 --> 06:16.910
Thank God we only had
the bailer to deal with.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.979
Yeah, that dim light
is a bitch, ain't it?

06:19.012 --> 06:20.080
Okay, guys, you know what?

06:20.113 --> 06:21.148
I didn't interrupt

06:21.181 --> 06:22.983
when you were having
your presentation.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.485
Actually, you did.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.854
Yes.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.656
Okay, let's do another one.

06:28.689 --> 06:29.857
This is a good one.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.693
"A particular concern
for office workers

06:32.726 --> 06:34.828
"is a sedimentary lifestyle,

06:34.862 --> 06:36.029
which can contribute--"

06:36.063 --> 06:37.698
Sedentary.

06:37.731 --> 06:42.002
Yes, "which can contribute
to heart disease."

06:42.035 --> 06:44.938
Heart disease kills
more people than bailers.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.974
That's called having
a fat butt, Michael.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.676
Mmm, no, no, it's--

06:48.709 --> 06:51.011
Yeah, yeah.
That's fat butt disease.

06:51.044 --> 06:51.779
That's what you're
suffering from?

06:51.812 --> 06:53.514
No.
Fat butt disease,
Michael?

06:53.547 --> 06:54.615
No, I--

06:54.648 --> 06:56.450
Excuse me, Sea Monster,
you weigh, like, 1,000 pounds.

06:56.484 --> 06:57.718
Yeah, I bet
you'd like to swim

06:57.751 --> 06:58.986
with this sea monster,
wouldn't you?

06:59.019 --> 07:00.721
Ryan!

07:00.754 --> 07:02.089
Dude, please,
tell your girl to shut up.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.157
What?
Kelly, you insulted
the gentleman.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.192
Please, apologize.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.193
Are you kidding me?

07:06.226 --> 07:07.227
All right,
we out of here.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.763
Darryl, I did not walk out
in the middle of yours.

07:09.797 --> 07:10.798
So I--

07:10.831 --> 07:11.932
Yeah, but ours
was real, Michael.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.034
Yes.
That's what we been
trying to tell you, Mike.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.769
It's serious down there.

07:15.803 --> 07:16.970
We do dangerous stuff, man.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.172
This is shenanigans,
foolishness.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.908
NERF ball.

07:20.941 --> 07:24.512
You live a sweet little
NERF-y life.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.179
Sittin' on your biscuit.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.048
Never havin' to risk it.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.085
Okay...

07:35.823 --> 07:37.891
What, NERF
isn't cool anymore?

07:37.925 --> 07:39.927
Darryl thinks
he's such a man

07:39.960 --> 07:41.795
because he works
in a warehouse.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.163
Well, big deal.

07:43.196 --> 07:46.534
I worked in a warehouse--
Men's Wearhouse.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.669
I was a greeter.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.037
I'd like to see Darryl
greet people.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.072
Probably make 'em
feel like wimps.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.007
Not me.
I...

07:56.243 --> 07:59.547
Hello, I'm Michael.
Welcome to Men's Wearhouse.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.682
We have a special
on khaki pants today.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.486
This is one example.

08:07.821 --> 08:08.789
Ten.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.091
Really, ten?
That's your guess?

08:11.124 --> 08:12.593
You're a professional
accountant.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.261
There's, like,
ten green ones.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.295
42.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.129
I'm gonna say 50.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.598
51.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.032
Oh, don't be that person.
Come on, that is lame.

08:19.066 --> 08:20.033
It's a strategy.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.034
It's called being smart.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.069
Thank you.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.103
(Kevin)
Oh, jeez.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.273
I don't know how the whole
betting thing started,

08:26.306 --> 08:27.975
but it's fun.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.042
Ten.
Kev's out.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.043
Damn it!

08:30.077 --> 08:31.712
47, 48, 49!

08:31.745 --> 08:32.713
Jim wins!

08:32.746 --> 08:33.747
Oh!

08:33.781 --> 08:34.815
That is not fair.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.016
He has spent hours
up here

08:36.049 --> 08:37.184
at reception with you.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.920
Hours and hours.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.254
Okay...okay.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.923
(Kevin)
No, constantly--
like, for years.

08:42.956 --> 08:43.991
(Jim)
Okay.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.226
Pam, depression is as scary
as a bailer, right?

08:46.259 --> 08:48.796
I...don't understand
the question.

08:48.829 --> 08:51.131
"Working in a office
can lead to depression

08:51.164 --> 08:53.066
"which can lead
to suicide."

08:54.367 --> 08:57.104
I mean this
is really serious stuff.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.105
Yeah.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.106
I--I--

08:59.139 --> 09:00.173
Nobody commits suicide

09:00.207 --> 09:01.975
because they work
with a bailer.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.011
And yet those guys
are making fun of me.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.279
Calling me a NERF.
That--

09:06.313 --> 09:08.749
It's really hard
to demonstrate depression.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.184
Their safety training
had visuals.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.254
Yeah...you are...

09:14.287 --> 09:16.790
Ah, so right.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.191
They have visual aids.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.994
And all we had were the facts.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.295
You don't go
to the science museum

09:22.329 --> 09:26.166
and get handed a pamphlet
on electricity.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.668
You go to the science museum

09:27.701 --> 09:30.137
and you put your hand
on a metal ball.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.139
Your hair sticks up straight.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.941
And you know science.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.242
So you're okay?

09:35.275 --> 09:37.344
Indubitably.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.313
They use props.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.815
They use visual aids.

09:41.849 --> 09:44.918
And they just made us
look like dopes.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.319
Idiots!

09:46.353 --> 09:48.221
God, what are we gonna do!

09:48.255 --> 09:49.022
I don't know.
I don't know.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.358
Because you know what
our killer is?

09:51.391 --> 09:54.194
Depression.
Wolves.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.228
Depression.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.296
Visual aids.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.965
Yes.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.800
A quilt--
depression quilt?

10:01.835 --> 10:03.804
No time to sew a quilt.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.306
I got it.

10:06.339 --> 10:07.107
Give me the number

10:07.140 --> 10:09.042
for the Giant Big Box
toy store.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.248
You may be asking yourself,

10:15.282 --> 10:17.150
"What am I doing
on a trampoline?"

10:17.184 --> 10:20.120
Well, I thought I'd bounce here
for a while,

10:20.153 --> 10:23.023
relieve some stress,
and then move on with my day.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.157
Not!

10:24.191 --> 10:25.358
Here's the plan.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.661
Dwight is going to gather

10:27.695 --> 10:30.330
all of the office workers
and all of the warehouse guys

10:30.363 --> 10:32.833
and we're going to have
another safety seminar.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.735
Only this time,
where's Michael?

10:34.768 --> 10:35.736
Oh, my God!

10:35.769 --> 10:37.337
He is on the roof!

10:37.370 --> 10:39.072
Now I've got their attention.

10:39.106 --> 10:40.808
I tell them about

10:40.841 --> 10:43.376
the cold hard facts
of depression.

10:43.410 --> 10:44.411
And then I say,

10:44.444 --> 10:47.981
"Hey, you ever seen
a suicide?"

10:48.015 --> 10:49.717
And I jump.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.118
And they freak out.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.921
And they get to see
the dangers of depression

10:53.954 --> 10:55.355
with their own eyes.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.825
Nice side note--
they might think,

10:57.858 --> 10:59.727
hey, I should've been nicer
to Michael.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.162
But that's not why
I'm doing this.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.330
Then I land on the trampoline,

11:03.363 --> 11:05.232
take a couple extra bounces
for fun.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.867
I climb off,
walk around the corner.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.201
Ta-freakin'-da!

11:10.037 --> 11:11.271
So then the next movie
moves to the top of the queue.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.740
So number five becomes
number four.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.074
Number six becomes
number five.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.342
Number three becomes
number two.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.376
Etcetera, etcetera.

11:16.409 --> 11:17.477
And let's just say

11:17.510 --> 11:19.179
that I just sent back
Love Actually,

11:19.212 --> 11:20.180
which was awesome.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.348
And they sent me Uptown Girls,

11:21.381 --> 11:22.716
which is also awesome.

11:22.750 --> 11:23.984
But guess what?

11:24.017 --> 11:25.285
Now I want to see
Love Actually again.

11:25.318 --> 11:26.386
But it's at the bottom
of the queue.

11:26.419 --> 11:27.821
Oh no!
What do I do?

11:27.855 --> 11:29.389
What I do is this:

11:29.422 --> 11:31.224
I go online,
I go "click, click, click,"

11:31.258 --> 11:33.193
and I change the order
of the queue

11:33.226 --> 11:35.328
so that I can see Love Actually
as soon as I want to.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.397
It's so easy, Ryan.

11:37.430 --> 11:40.167
Do you really not know
how Netflix works?

11:41.268 --> 11:42.269
I guess I forgot.

11:43.971 --> 11:45.072
You're such a ditz.

11:46.306 --> 11:49.242
Ryan, well done.
2 minutes, 42 seconds.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.011
Additionally, Pam,
you win ten

11:51.044 --> 11:52.813
because she said "awesome"
12 times.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.848
And Jim, you win five

11:54.882 --> 11:57.317
because she mentioned
six romantic comedies.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.286
(Dwight)
Okay, let's do this thing!

11:59.319 --> 12:00.287
I'll go summon the troops.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.355
Maybe we should test this first,

12:02.389 --> 12:04.057
Letterman-style.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.158
Throw a TV over.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.995
We measured it once.

12:09.296 --> 12:10.931
Go buy some watermelons.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.900
Seedless?

12:12.933 --> 12:14.434
Just...

12:20.273 --> 12:22.509
Creed is eating an apple.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.311
I found a potato.

12:26.013 --> 12:27.114
Hey, Creed.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.315
Hey!

12:28.348 --> 12:29.349
Hi.
Hello.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.358
[whispering]
Yes!

12:38.391 --> 12:39.392
Here you go.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.427
Nice.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.496
(Karen)
I don't know this place

12:43.530 --> 12:44.865
as well as I thought I did.

12:44.898 --> 12:47.400
I'm getting cleaned out.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.501
Ready?
Let's do it.

12:48.535 --> 12:49.536
Drop that sucker.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.372
(Michael)
Yeah, bingo!

12:52.405 --> 12:54.074
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:54.107 --> 12:55.508
Oh, crap!

12:55.542 --> 12:57.544
[car alarm wailing]

12:57.577 --> 12:59.512
Deactivate the car alarm,
clean up the mess.

12:59.546 --> 13:00.580
Okay.

13:00.613 --> 13:01.815
Find out whose car
that is.

13:01.849 --> 13:02.883
If it's Stanley's,

13:02.916 --> 13:04.484
call the offices
of James P. Albini.

13:04.517 --> 13:05.819
See if he handles hate crimes.

13:05.853 --> 13:06.820
Got it.

13:06.854 --> 13:07.821
Also, take apart the trampoline,

13:07.855 --> 13:08.621
stick it in the bailer.

13:08.655 --> 13:09.890
We're not allowed
to use the bailer.

13:10.891 --> 13:11.859
Have Patch do it...

13:11.892 --> 13:12.993
or the sea monster.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.361
I'm on it!

13:14.394 --> 13:16.029
Eh...

13:17.931 --> 13:20.200
I'm temporarily lifting
the shun.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.268
Thank you.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.269
It means nothing.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.236
I need you to do something
for me.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.404
Anything.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.605
Okay, calm down.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.174
I need you to acquire

13:27.207 --> 13:30.243
an inflatable house
and/or castle.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.311
You mean a moon bounce?

13:31.344 --> 13:33.046
What do you think?
You've got an hour.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.614
I'm gonna need petty cash.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.216
Shunning resumed.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.319
Do you--do you want
a drawbridge?

13:39.352 --> 13:40.353
Un-shun.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.891
Yeah, that sounds good.
Re-shun.

13:46.093 --> 13:47.928
(Dwight)
Oh, yeah,
this is much better.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.396
Safer.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.998
An excellent decision.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.000
Yes.
Thank you for seeing that.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.101
When you land,

13:54.134 --> 13:55.502
try and land
like an eight-year-old.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.470
These bouncy castles
are not designed for adults.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.072
I don't know
if I want to do this.

13:59.106 --> 13:59.940
Do you want to do
another test?

13:59.973 --> 14:01.341
I got plenty of watermelons
in my trunk.

14:01.374 --> 14:02.943
No.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.344
No more;
the tests are going terrible.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.279
If we keep doing them,
I'm not gonna want to jump.

14:07.915 --> 14:10.250
This is about doing,
not thinking.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.251
Right, doing!

14:11.284 --> 14:13.253
Totally doing!
It's rock and roll!

14:13.286 --> 14:14.387
Rock and roll!
Yeah!

14:14.421 --> 14:15.622
You're right;
I'm not thinking.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.457
[making electric guitar sounds]

14:17.490 --> 14:18.625
Yes, yeah!

14:18.658 --> 14:21.261
(Dwight)
* Michael is awesome

14:21.294 --> 14:22.395
* Jumpin' of the roof
Whoo!

14:22.429 --> 14:24.364
* Bouncin' on a bouncy bounce
Whoo!

14:24.397 --> 14:25.933
* Show 'em who's boss
Whoo!

14:25.966 --> 14:28.068
* Rip a hole in the sun
Whoo!

14:28.101 --> 14:29.102
I am ready to do this!

14:29.136 --> 14:32.639
[making guitar noises]
I'm ready to make a point!

14:32.672 --> 14:34.307
Hey, guys, listen up.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.309
Michael is up on the roof

14:36.343 --> 14:37.911
and acting strange.

14:37.945 --> 14:40.313
Whoa, what's the situation?

14:40.347 --> 14:42.249
Un-shun.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.251
I think he's suffering
from depression.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.452
Re-shun.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.187
Okay, when's the shunning thing
gonna end?

14:47.220 --> 14:49.256
Un-shun...never!
Re-shun.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.557
I think he wants you all

14:50.590 --> 14:52.125
to come out to the parking lot

14:52.159 --> 14:53.293
and watch him die.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.162
Is it nice outside?

14:55.195 --> 14:56.263
It's gorgeous.
Let's go!

14:56.296 --> 14:57.297
Do I need my jacket?

14:57.330 --> 14:58.932
No, really, it's very nice.

14:58.966 --> 14:59.832
(Dwight)
Come on!

14:59.866 --> 15:00.968
Will I be too warm
in a long sleeve T?

15:01.001 --> 15:03.303
Everyone's gonna be fine
in exactly what they're wearing!

15:03.336 --> 15:04.504
Let's go!

15:07.307 --> 15:08.475
Let's go!

15:13.080 --> 15:14.447
Come on, hurry up, you guys!

15:14.481 --> 15:15.715
My life!

15:15.748 --> 15:18.485
Oh, my life...

15:18.518 --> 15:21.021
Michael, what's wrong?

15:21.054 --> 15:22.522
Everything's wrong.

15:22.555 --> 15:25.258
The stress of my modern office

15:25.292 --> 15:27.961
has caused me to go
into a depression.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.997
Depression?

15:30.030 --> 15:33.166
Isn't that just a fancy word
for feeling bummed out?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.667
Dwight, you ignorant slut.

15:34.701 --> 15:38.205
Depression is
a very serious illness.

15:38.238 --> 15:43.176
Over 32,000 people
commit suicide every year,

15:43.210 --> 15:45.645
according to a 2004 study.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.480
Is that the last year to date
it was available?

15:47.514 --> 15:48.315
Yes.

15:48.348 --> 15:52.585
My head is in such pain
and turmoil!

15:52.619 --> 15:54.487
(Dwight)
Don't do anything rash.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.256
Dwight, where are
the warehouse guys?

15:56.289 --> 15:58.325
I didn't--

16:01.394 --> 16:03.330
I didn't think you need them
for this part.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.398
Okay...that's--

16:05.432 --> 16:07.200
You said to just--
That's the whole point, dummy.

16:07.234 --> 16:09.002
Okay, I'm on it.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.170
Okay.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.240
Attention blue collar workers!

16:14.741 --> 16:16.476
(Pam)
What are the odds
that this

16:16.509 --> 16:18.045
is in any way real?

16:18.078 --> 16:21.014
I'd say, like, 10,000 to 1.

16:21.048 --> 16:24.151
Okay, I'd like ten bucks
on those odds.

16:24.184 --> 16:28.155
If someone gives you
10,000 to 1 on anything,

16:28.188 --> 16:29.722
you take it.

16:29.756 --> 16:33.226
If John Mellencamp
ever wins an Oscar,

16:33.260 --> 16:37.230
I am going to be
a very rich dude.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.732
Michael's up on the roof

16:39.766 --> 16:42.135
and he's acting strange!

16:42.169 --> 16:44.104
Oh, my life!

16:44.137 --> 16:45.438
Michael, what's wrong?

16:45.472 --> 16:47.607
Everything's wrong, Dwight!

16:47.640 --> 16:50.143
The stress of my modern office

16:50.177 --> 16:51.544
has made me depressed.

16:51.578 --> 16:52.579
Depressed?

16:52.612 --> 16:54.081
Isn't that just a fancy word

16:54.114 --> 16:55.548
for feeling bummed out?

16:55.582 --> 16:57.250
Dwight, you ignorant slut.

16:57.284 --> 16:58.185
(Jim)
Well, you know,

16:58.218 --> 17:00.087
the first performance
was a little off.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.621
But I really think
they hit their stride

17:01.654 --> 17:03.290
in the second show.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.691
Um...

17:04.724 --> 17:07.194
Might even bring my parents
tomorrow to the matinee.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.628
(Michael)
And that is why...

17:08.661 --> 17:10.697
Oh, excuse me.
It's my favorite part.

17:10.730 --> 17:11.798
I am going to jump off
this roof.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.733
This is just offensive.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.302
At least we're outside.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.303
(Creed)
Hey, check it out.

17:16.336 --> 17:17.604
There's a castle over there.

17:17.637 --> 17:20.640
Oh, my God.
There is a castle.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.510
(Dwight on megaphone)
No, there's nothing to see
over there, people.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.312
There's nothing to see.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.281
They found the castle, Michael.

17:28.315 --> 17:29.816
Damn it.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.820
Oh, God.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.155
Oh, my God!

17:35.188 --> 17:36.389
He's gonna jump.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.126
Oh.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.228
He's going to kill himself

17:41.261 --> 17:42.429
pretending to kill himself.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.197
Yeah.

17:46.433 --> 17:49.068
Hey, uh, Michael.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.739
Don't jump on
the bouncy castle.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.774
You can't do that

17:54.807 --> 17:57.377
'cause you are going to get
horribly, horribly injured.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.213
Hey, Michael.

18:00.247 --> 18:01.881
I have a present
for you

18:01.914 --> 18:03.483
but you have to come down
and get it.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.085
What is it?

18:06.119 --> 18:08.688
Come down and open it
and you'll see.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.423
Dwight, find out
what the present is.

18:10.457 --> 18:13.160
Okay, uh...
I don't see anything.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.261
She might be bluffing.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.262
(Pam and Jim)
Dwight.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.197
What are you--

18:17.230 --> 18:18.831
Oh.

18:18.865 --> 18:21.134
It's, uh...

18:21.168 --> 18:25.772
A Repliee Q1 Expo
female robot.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.407
They're only available
in Japan.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.209
Dwight, you are such
a liar.

18:29.242 --> 18:30.377
Pam, really, what is it?

18:30.410 --> 18:33.213
Mike, this is the opposite
of safety.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.148
You jump, you're gonna
seriously hurt yourself.

18:35.182 --> 18:38.418
You told me that I lead a...

18:38.451 --> 18:42.255
a cushy, wimpy, NERF life.

18:42.289 --> 18:46.359
Yeah, but I never said
you had nothing to live for.

18:46.393 --> 18:47.827
What do I have
to live for?

18:47.860 --> 18:50.263
A lot...of things.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.302
Uh, you, uh...

19:00.807 --> 19:02.375
What about Jan?

19:02.409 --> 19:05.945
Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan,
man.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.181
It's going good, right?

19:08.215 --> 19:11.384
(Michael)
It's complicated with Jan.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.785
And I don't know
where I stand

19:12.819 --> 19:14.821
or what I want.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.390
The sex isn't nearly as good
as it used to be.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.526
Mike...

19:19.559 --> 19:20.827
you're a very brave man.

19:20.860 --> 19:24.431
I mean, it takes courage
just to be you.

19:24.464 --> 19:27.634
To get out of bed
every single day

19:27.667 --> 19:31.204
knowing full well
you gotta be you.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.440
Do you really mean that?

19:33.473 --> 19:35.375
I couldn't do it.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.777
I ain't that strong
and I ain't that brave.

19:37.810 --> 19:38.878
I'm braver than you?

19:38.911 --> 19:40.980
Way braver!

19:41.013 --> 19:42.482
You Braveheart, man.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.654
I Braveheart.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.258
I am.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.392
Come on down, okay?

19:52.425 --> 19:54.927
Okay.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.330
Pam, I'm coming down
to get my present.

19:58.798 --> 20:02.769
(Michael)
An office is as safe
as the people in it.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.604
And sometimes those people

20:04.637 --> 20:07.006
can drive you to do
crazy things

20:07.039 --> 20:11.244
to show the dangers
of the office.

20:11.278 --> 20:14.447
That's the danger
I found myself in today.

20:14.481 --> 20:18.751
I saved a life--my own.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.553
Am I a hero?

20:24.491 --> 20:25.592
I really can't say.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.226
But, yes.
