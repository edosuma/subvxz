WEBVTT

00:02.003 --> 00:03.669
Hi, everyone, I'm home.

00:03.671 --> 00:05.871
Hi, honey,
supper's almost ready.

00:05.873 --> 00:07.172
Great. I'm starved.

00:07.174 --> 00:09.441
What's in the box, Willie?

00:09.443 --> 00:12.277
I'm fine, Alf.
How are you?

00:12.279 --> 00:16.648
Racked with curiosity,
cloaked in conundrum

00:16.650 --> 00:19.218
and carrying a thesaurus.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.053
Now, what's in that box?

00:21.055 --> 00:25.224
Did you ever hear the expression
"Curiosity killed the cat?"

00:25.226 --> 00:28.494
Yeah, it's usually
followed by the expression

00:28.496 --> 00:30.763
"Pass the plum sauce."

00:32.033 --> 00:33.832
Hey, dad, what's in the box?

00:33.834 --> 00:37.236
It's a dead cat, B.
I'll split it with ya.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.705
It's<i> not</i> a dead cat.

00:39.707 --> 00:43.709
But I think it is something
that you and Brian will enjoy.

00:43.711 --> 00:46.111
Is it the remains
of the Elephant Man?

00:47.915 --> 00:50.315
It's a tent!

00:50.317 --> 00:53.819
I thought you might enjoy
camping out in the backyard.

00:53.821 --> 00:57.322
Why? The refrigerator
and bathroom are in here.

00:58.893 --> 01:02.094
Look, uh, you're gonna
get to stay in the backyard

01:02.096 --> 01:05.597
in this tent
for a couple of days.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.166
Why?

01:07.168 --> 01:09.201
Because my Uncle Albert called

01:09.203 --> 01:10.936
he's coming for a visit.

01:10.938 --> 01:13.072
- Oh, no.
- Uncle Albert?

01:13.074 --> 01:15.541
Why is he coming?
He doesn't even like it here.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.743
All he does is complain.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.612
Well, it's not like
this place is Shangri-La.

01:21.916 --> 01:24.917
[theme music]

01:53.380 --> 01:56.648
[music continues]

02:24.278 --> 02:26.845
[instrumental music]

02:28.749 --> 02:31.583
Willie, we voted
fair and square.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.619
Uncle Albert
stays in the tent.

02:33.621 --> 02:37.356
No, you're staying
in the tent, ALF.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.691
Well, I don't wanna
sleep out here.

02:39.693 --> 02:43.428
This place is swarming
with armored leeches.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.330
Those are snails.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.766
I don't care if they're
slugs with hunchbacks

02:47.768 --> 02:50.836
I'm not sleeping out here.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.972
Look, ALF, we always
make you stay in the garage.

02:53.974 --> 02:57.342
I thought sleeping in a tent
would be a nice change of pace.

02:57.344 --> 03:00.045
Yeah. Listen,
Will and testament.

03:00.047 --> 03:02.548
Since Uncle Albert
is such a pain

03:02.550 --> 03:05.817
why don't you
just tell the guy to bug off?

03:05.819 --> 03:08.787
Oh, I can't do that, ALF.
He's family.

03:08.789 --> 03:11.957
Fine. Now you're stuck
with an unwanted house guest.

03:11.959 --> 03:15.394
Isn't it strange how that
pattern keeps repeating itself?

03:16.330 --> 03:19.631
Why? Kate's mother's coming too?

03:19.633 --> 03:22.734
- Let's just put up the tent.
- Fine.

03:22.736 --> 03:25.103
Why is it taking so long?

03:29.977 --> 03:31.043
[sighs]

03:31.045 --> 03:33.979
It's taking so long
because you keep undoing

03:33.981 --> 03:35.948
everything I'm doing.

03:38.586 --> 03:42.321
Would you please hand me..

03:42.323 --> 03:44.456
"...a box of wing nuts?"

03:46.093 --> 03:47.993
Wing nuts?

03:47.995 --> 03:51.430
Uh...I'm afraid
I've eaten them.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.768
You ate a box of wing nuts?

03:57.705 --> 03:59.972
I thought it said walnuts.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.576
Don't bother looking for the
package marked Tent Stakes.

04:06.614 --> 04:09.982
I think I'd better just finish,
finish this by myself.

04:11.418 --> 04:12.584
Fine.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.921
I'll be over here
if you need me.

04:15.923 --> 04:19.191
I'll keep that in mind
in case things go too<i> smoothly.</i>

04:20.728 --> 04:23.295
Hi, guys.
How's it goin'?

04:23.297 --> 04:27.099
Fine. Except ALF's
digested most of the<i> parts.</i>

04:30.137 --> 04:33.305
Willie, what happens
if the ball hits the paddle?

04:35.376 --> 04:38.944
I don't think
you'll have to worry about it.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.446
Willie, Uncle Albert
just called.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.548
He's not coming?

04:43.550 --> 04:45.317
He's coming.

04:45.319 --> 04:48.887
He wants to know
what shoe size you wear.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.323
Oh, right, why bother
to bring shoes

04:51.325 --> 04:52.658
when he can borrow mine.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.127
- Ah.
- What a mooch.

04:55.129 --> 04:57.996
Now, whose shoes
am I supposed to wear?

05:04.338 --> 05:07.506
He also wants to know
my dress size.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.574
Maybe he wants to buy us gifts.

05:09.576 --> 05:12.944
Gifts, schmifts.
The guy sounds like a pervert.

05:12.946 --> 05:16.315
I guess I'll have to
pound some sense into him.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.583
You're not to
beat the house guests, ALF.

05:18.585 --> 05:20.952
Not even Uncle Albert.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.655
Well, this guy sounds
like a real monkey's uncle.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.325
No offense, Willie.

05:26.327 --> 05:29.361
Oh, you're right.
He, he's terrible.

05:29.363 --> 05:32.864
He's no sooner in the door then,
"Hey, it's freezing in here.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.334
"Turn up the heat.
What's that stink?

05:35.336 --> 05:36.968
"Is that you cooking, Kate?

05:36.970 --> 05:39.204
Uh, by the way,
I'm gonna stay another week."

05:39.206 --> 05:42.874
Wow! What a great impression
of Bette Davis.

05:45.179 --> 05:49.348
Willie, I can't
stay in that tent.

05:49.350 --> 05:52.017
I'm deathly afraid
of the outdoors.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.519
I once got caught
in a meteor shower

05:54.521 --> 05:56.688
without my umbrella.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.825
- Nice try, ALF.
- Thanks.

05:59.827 --> 06:02.461
I was gonna faint,
but I think I made my point.

06:03.564 --> 06:06.231
Too bad we didn't buy it.

06:06.233 --> 06:07.399
You didn't?

06:07.401 --> 06:09.601
[gasps]

06:11.372 --> 06:13.605
ALF, you fainted on a snail.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.275
Whoa. Whoa.

06:18.579 --> 06:21.580
[instrumental music]

06:24.385 --> 06:26.918
Chocolate cake.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.653
Check.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.856
Chocolate ice cream.

06:30.858 --> 06:33.158
Check.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.626
Chocolate pudding.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.429
Check.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.932
- Acne pads.
- Check.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.870
What are you guys doing?

06:44.872 --> 06:47.339
ALF's teaching me
how to be a box boy.

06:48.409 --> 06:50.575
I'm collecting refreshments

06:50.577 --> 06:52.444
for my stay under the big top.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.880
ALF, it's only for two days.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.682
Well, that's why
I'm not bringing my toothbrush.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.251
(Willie)
'Hi, everyone.'

06:59.253 --> 07:01.453
(Kate)
'We're back with Uncle Albert!'

07:01.455 --> 07:03.789
Why do they walk
into a house yelling?

07:03.791 --> 07:06.525
That's a signal
for you to get into the tent.

07:06.527 --> 07:09.761
Oh. And here I thought
they were going deaf.

07:11.598 --> 07:15.167
[sighs]
Well, Bri, let's put a smile on
for the old fogey.

07:18.405 --> 07:19.771
Oh, slippers.

07:19.773 --> 07:23.475
How thoughtful,
and how unexpected.

07:23.477 --> 07:26.578
Uncle Albert,
this dress is gorgeous!

07:26.580 --> 07:28.613
Yeah, I know.
I picked it out myself.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.315
Oh!

07:30.317 --> 07:31.917
(Albert)
Oh.

07:31.919 --> 07:34.853
Would you look
at these beautiful children!

07:37.624 --> 07:39.090
Us?

07:39.092 --> 07:43.462
Lynn, you've blossomed
into a lovely young lady.

07:43.464 --> 07:46.097
Well, thank you, Uncle Albert.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.500
It's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

07:48.502 --> 07:51.136
Or anyone.

07:51.138 --> 07:54.473
- And, Brian..
- You remembered my name.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.508
Well, of course I did, Brian.

07:56.510 --> 08:00.512
- Here, give me a five.
- I don't have $5.

08:00.514 --> 08:03.081
Oh-oh, the Tanner wit.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.250
First I've heard of it.

08:05.252 --> 08:09.754
Brian, how would you like
an Angels' baseball hat, huh?

08:09.756 --> 08:13.692
- How much?
- Come on, it's free!

08:13.694 --> 08:15.260
Thanks, Uncle Albert!

08:15.262 --> 08:17.162
I'm gonna go show A..

08:17.164 --> 08:19.564
The guy in the tent.

08:21.335 --> 08:22.934
The guy in the tent?

08:22.936 --> 08:26.705
- Uh..
- He has an imaginary friend.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.039
Oh.

08:28.041 --> 08:31.977
Now, Lynn,
guess where this is from.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.979
You found it on a bus?

08:33.981 --> 08:36.548
No. It's from Gucci's.

08:36.550 --> 08:37.782
Gucci?

08:37.784 --> 08:39.784
Well, what happened
to the army-navy store?

08:39.786 --> 08:42.354
Oh, not anymore.
Not for my Lynnie.

08:42.356 --> 08:46.391
- Well...thanks.
- It's my pleasure.

08:46.393 --> 08:48.727
Now, let's all go
to dinner, huh?

08:48.729 --> 08:52.330
- Oh, I, uh--
- Don't worry. The tab's on me.

08:52.332 --> 08:55.467
Oh, but I'm not payin'
for Brian's invisible friend.

08:56.803 --> 08:59.471
[instrumental music]

09:00.908 --> 09:04.209
Oh, could you believe
the size of that dinner check?

09:04.211 --> 09:07.412
And Uncle Albert
left a 30 percent tip.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.714
He usually
only leaves 30 cents.

09:09.716 --> 09:13.652
Oh. What are we gonna do
with all those leftovers?

09:13.654 --> 09:15.387
[ALF burps]

09:16.924 --> 09:19.491
I think they may have been
taken care of.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.460
Meatball?

09:23.730 --> 09:25.030
No, thank you.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.198
ALF, did you eat
all of that food?

09:27.200 --> 09:30.669
Yeah, and for the first time
in my life

09:30.671 --> 09:33.572
I actually feel full.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.574
Why aren't you out in that tent?

09:35.576 --> 09:37.842
It's too dangerous out there.

09:37.844 --> 09:39.744
I had to kill
a 50-foot water snake

09:39.746 --> 09:42.447
with my pocket knife.

09:42.449 --> 09:45.450
There, there are no
50-foot water snakes

09:45.452 --> 09:46.551
in the backyard.

09:46.553 --> 09:49.354
I'm tellin' ya,
it was bright green

09:49.356 --> 09:50.789
and it spit water.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.191
Psst. Psst.

09:53.193 --> 09:56.394
That was my new garden hose.

09:56.396 --> 09:59.998
Well, no wonder
it was sucking on the spigot.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.769
Go on. Go back to the tent.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.072
I can't. I'm bored.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.441
I need companionship.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.543
I need a woman.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.712
What?

10:13.714 --> 10:16.948
I'm desperate. Species is
no longer a priority.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.085
Alf..

10:20.087 --> 10:22.287
You only have to
stay in that tent one more day.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.890
Uncle Albert is leaving
tomorrow night.

10:25.892 --> 10:28.093
That's not soon enough.

10:28.095 --> 10:30.595
Look, I have to go grocery
shopping tomorrow morning.

10:30.597 --> 10:32.831
That leaves you and Uncle Albert
alone in the house.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.065
I want you to promise me

10:34.067 --> 10:36.835
that you will stay zipped
into that tent.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.737
But I'll miss my soaps.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.305
- Tsk.
- You don't watch soaps.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.807
[sighs]
He means the one
where the coyote

10:42.809 --> 10:45.043
tries to catch the road runner.

10:45.612 --> 10:46.911
Exactly.

10:46.913 --> 10:50.515
One Friday, the coyote
fell off an 80-foot cliff.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.852
I've gotta see if he survived.

10:55.288 --> 10:58.690
Well, he's not
made of iron, people.

10:58.692 --> 10:59.858
[instrumental music]

10:59.860 --> 11:01.660
(Albert)
'Let's go in the kitchen, huh?'

11:01.662 --> 11:04.462
I'll make you breakfast.

11:04.464 --> 11:07.766
Katie, why are you
washing the dishes?

11:08.802 --> 11:11.403
- They're dirty?
- Here, let me do that.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.877
Uncle Albert, could,
could I ask you a question?

11:18.879 --> 11:20.045
Shoot.

11:20.047 --> 11:23.148
- What's wrong with you?
- Wrong?

11:23.150 --> 11:25.116
Why are you acting so nice?

11:25.118 --> 11:27.719
Yeah, the dinner
and the cab rides

11:27.721 --> 11:31.956
and the Gucci and the slippers
and the 30 percent tip.

11:31.958 --> 11:34.059
Alright, alright,
I'll tell you.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.727
Come on, sit down.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.796
I<i> have</i> changed.

11:37.798 --> 11:40.865
It all began when they took me
to the hospital..

11:40.867 --> 11:43.902
...after my heart attack.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.737
We didn't know
you had a heart attack.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.138
Who did?

11:47.140 --> 11:50.742
Nobody missed me,
so nobody checked on me.

11:50.744 --> 11:53.044
I was flat on my back
for a month.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.880
No visitors.
You know, no get-well cards.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.749
Not a phone call even.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.517
And that's when
I began to realize

11:59.519 --> 12:01.820
what a louse
I must have been.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.825
I realized
I had to mend my ways.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.728
That's why I came.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.896
Well, you're off
to a good start.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.199
We hardly remember the old you.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.534
Thanks, Katie,
that's what I wanted to hear.

12:16.536 --> 12:19.003
Now, you two go on,
before the old me comes back.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.338
Well, we wouldn't want
that to happen.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.340
Go on. I've got
tuna fish to make.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.776
Okay. Uh, see you after work.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.177
I'll be back in a little while.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.212
Come on, now you're making me

12:27.214 --> 12:28.913
feel all squishy inside.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.249
Get out of here, will ya?

12:36.223 --> 12:39.491
[comical music on T.V.]

12:50.637 --> 12:53.671
[music continues]

13:07.654 --> 13:09.687
Care for a cookie?

13:14.828 --> 13:17.328
Alright, after your nap.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.901
[instrumental music]

13:24.271 --> 13:27.272
[telephone rings]

13:27.274 --> 13:29.707
Hello, social services.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.410
Hold, please.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.979
Hey, Willie,
call for you on line four.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.915
Sounds like Sammy Davis Jr.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.288
Hello.

13:43.290 --> 13:47.492
Hey, man, how'd you like
this clever ruse?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.027
(Willie)
Why are you
calling me at work?

13:49.029 --> 13:52.030
You promised
to stay in the tent!

13:55.502 --> 13:58.837
But we're out of canned peaches.

13:58.839 --> 14:02.006
You.. You called me for peaches?

14:02.008 --> 14:06.377
Well, I also need grape leaves,
yellow cellophane.

14:06.379 --> 14:09.881
- And a tag for the toe.
- A tag for the what?

14:09.883 --> 14:11.883
(ALF)
'You're not writing
this down, are you?'

14:11.885 --> 14:14.819
No, I'm not!
What is this all about?

14:14.821 --> 14:17.322
Alright, it was
gonna be a surprise

14:17.324 --> 14:20.592
but Uncle Albert's dead.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.327
What?

14:22.329 --> 14:23.895
Hey, hey, don't worry.

14:23.897 --> 14:26.865
I've already started
the embalming process.

14:26.867 --> 14:29.133
That's why I need the peaches.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.204
Wait!

14:34.674 --> 14:37.742
Willie, is it true Sammy
is going on the road again?

14:39.212 --> 14:42.213
[instrumental music]

14:42.215 --> 14:43.615
[door opens]

14:45.986 --> 14:48.987
ALF...what is going on here?

14:49.990 --> 14:51.356
We're celebrating.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.024
Uncle Albert is gone.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.826
[rattling]

14:56.329 --> 14:59.163
He left without saying goodbye?

14:59.165 --> 15:01.766
It was rather sudden.

15:01.768 --> 15:02.934
Kate.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.003
Kate.

15:06.239 --> 15:09.007
Where are my peaches?

15:09.009 --> 15:11.009
Is it true about Uncle Albert?

15:11.011 --> 15:12.377
Well, apparently so.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.946
[scoffs]
I mean, talk about
the perfect guest..

15:14.948 --> 15:16.281
He came, he was nice

15:16.283 --> 15:19.183
and he left before
we got tired of him.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.386
Oh, Kate, please.

15:21.388 --> 15:24.789
Hey, come on, man! Lighten up.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.958
Here, have a hat.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.961
Have you no respect
for the dead?

15:29.963 --> 15:32.196
Dead?

15:32.198 --> 15:35.333
ALF, you said
Uncle Albert was gone.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.603
You thought he left?

15:40.140 --> 15:42.273
- Oh, my God.
- What happened?

15:42.275 --> 15:45.143
ALF, exactly what happened?

15:45.145 --> 15:48.379
Well, I was in the tent
watching T.V..

15:49.382 --> 15:52.283
Incidentally,
the coyote did survive.

15:53.820 --> 15:57.422
...when Uncle Albert
stuck is head in.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.824
- He saw you?
- Yeah.

15:59.826 --> 16:01.392
I offered him
one of Kate's cookies

16:01.394 --> 16:03.828
but he keeled over.

16:06.933 --> 16:09.067
Hey, don't take it personally.

16:09.069 --> 16:12.437
Some people
just don't have a sweet tooth.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.138
Speaking of which

16:14.140 --> 16:16.341
did you get those
canned peaches, Willie?

16:16.343 --> 16:19.043
I need to finish
basting the deceased.

16:23.650 --> 16:27.485
Hey, hey, let the guy
marinate in peace.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.524
Hey!

16:34.594 --> 16:38.162
- Are we having a party?
- I'm trying to.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.098
This isn't a party.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.199
Sure it is!

16:41.201 --> 16:43.434
It's just like a birthday party

16:43.436 --> 16:46.871
only someone else
has to blow out the candles.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.045
It, it's true.

16:55.482 --> 16:58.649
- Told ya.
- Told ya what?

16:58.651 --> 17:00.051
Brian..

17:01.688 --> 17:03.621
Brian..

17:05.058 --> 17:08.226
Un-Uncle Albert..

17:08.228 --> 17:10.361
...ha-has passed away.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.231
What?

17:13.233 --> 17:14.899
He's gone.

17:14.901 --> 17:17.201
Sleeps with the peaches.

17:17.203 --> 17:20.038
He's a forest lawn jockey.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.874
ALF, you're upsetting Brian.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.409
No, he's not.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.878
Thattaway, Brian!

17:26.880 --> 17:28.479
Death is a happy time.

17:28.481 --> 17:31.482
A time to...to celebrate.

17:37.090 --> 17:40.091
Well, at least on Melmac it was.

17:41.428 --> 17:44.095
This is not Melmac,
this is Earth.

17:44.097 --> 17:46.964
And on Earth,
death is a very sad occasion.

17:47.934 --> 17:50.234
Really?

17:50.236 --> 17:51.269
Well..

17:51.271 --> 17:53.037
I guess few of
the things I've said

17:53.039 --> 17:56.174
could be interpreted
as somewhat tasteless.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.510
I don't get it.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.946
Am I supposed to be
sad or happy?

18:03.917 --> 18:05.550
Sad.

18:05.552 --> 18:08.419
Brian, someone
who loved you is gone.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.122
I say happy.

18:11.124 --> 18:14.092
Look at it from
Uncle Albert's point of view.

18:14.094 --> 18:16.127
He'll never be sad again.

18:16.129 --> 18:19.063
Or tired...or hungry.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.631
Or late for work!

18:20.633 --> 18:23.434
His time came, and he went.

18:25.905 --> 18:28.573
I-I can't help think
it was my fault.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.775
I should have been more careful.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.377
I put ALF in the tent,
now Albert saw him

18:33.379 --> 18:36.914
and he, he probably
died of shock.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.583
Hey, come on.

18:38.585 --> 18:41.486
Don't blame yourself, Willie.

18:41.488 --> 18:44.322
Gosh, if anyone
killed Uncle Albert..

18:47.127 --> 18:49.026
...it was me.

18:49.996 --> 18:53.030
[instrumental music]

18:59.139 --> 19:03.040
Kate, you think this tie
is too loud for a funeral?

19:04.978 --> 19:07.178
Willie, the tie is black.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.579
It's charcoal.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.681
It's fine.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.017
How you guys holding up?

19:13.019 --> 19:15.319
[sighs]
Okay, I guess.

19:15.321 --> 19:19.157
It just doesn't seem fair
that Uncle Albert had to go now

19:19.159 --> 19:22.193
just, just when he was learning
how to be a good person.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.328
I know. How's ALF taking it?

19:24.330 --> 19:27.331
Oh, not too well. He still
thinks it was his fault.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.267
But it's not,
he couldn't help it

19:29.269 --> 19:31.269
if Uncle Albert
stuck his head in the tent.

19:31.271 --> 19:34.272
I told him that but he said that
his looks were lethal

19:34.274 --> 19:37.341
and we should get him
a permit for his face.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.544
- I'll try talking to him.
- 'Thanks, honey.'

19:39.546 --> 19:41.445
(Kate)
'Willie, we really should go.'

19:41.447 --> 19:45.183
Now, if you need us, we'll be
at the Waxman Funeral Parlor.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.251
Okay, have fun.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.188
Sorry.

19:50.190 --> 19:53.124
[somber music]

19:57.830 --> 19:59.664
ALF?

19:59.666 --> 20:01.199
ALF, are you in there?

20:01.201 --> 20:03.401
(ALF)
'Go away.'

20:03.403 --> 20:06.370
I brought you some banana bread.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.239
ALF, please come out of there.

20:08.241 --> 20:11.242
'No! If you see me, you'll die.'

20:11.244 --> 20:13.477
[chuckles]
I've already seen you.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.746
I know what you look like.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.119
ALF..

20:23.423 --> 20:26.390
I'm double-bagged
for your protection.

20:26.392 --> 20:29.393
Come on.
Eat some banana bread.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.696
I'm not hungry.

20:31.698 --> 20:34.432
You really are upset.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.434
What was death like on Melmac?

20:36.436 --> 20:38.336
Predictable.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.404
Everyone died at the same age.

20:40.406 --> 20:43.107
Six hundred and fifty.

20:43.109 --> 20:44.709
There were no surprises.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.210
And you could plan.

20:46.212 --> 20:48.946
You could stock up
on fruit and things?

20:50.450 --> 20:51.849
Exactly.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.517
And the week before you go

20:53.519 --> 20:55.987
you give away
your personal belongings.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.856
The year before you go..

20:58.858 --> 21:01.092
...your credit cards
are canceled.

21:02.262 --> 21:05.896
I'd be afraid to know
exactly when I was gonna die.

21:05.898 --> 21:08.599
Hey, I'd be afraid not to know.

21:09.702 --> 21:13.237
That's why I feel
so bad about Uncle Albert.

21:13.239 --> 21:15.306
I took him before his time.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.542
Thanks to me..

21:18.544 --> 21:21.445
...he didn't have a chance
to wrap things up.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.281
Yes, he did.

21:23.283 --> 21:25.249
What are you talkin' about?

21:25.251 --> 21:27.752
See, Uncle Albert
came here to make amends

21:27.754 --> 21:30.821
to show us that he really
could be a nice guy.

21:30.823 --> 21:33.124
A lot of people
don't get a chance to do that.

21:33.126 --> 21:35.293
But he did.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.228
- Really?
- Really.

21:38.331 --> 21:40.064
Well, if that's true

21:40.066 --> 21:42.633
then I'll get over
this eventually.

21:42.635 --> 21:46.971
But I'd still like
to stay in this box awhile.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.506
I understand.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.341
You need some time to think.

21:50.343 --> 21:51.909
Yeah.

21:56.349 --> 21:58.416
Oh, hey, Lynn?

21:58.418 --> 22:00.651
You<i> could</i> leave
that banana bread.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.600
Hey, you're outta your box.

22:16.602 --> 22:18.869
Yeah. How was the funeral?

22:20.106 --> 22:24.141
Oh, not so bad
as I thought it would be.

22:24.143 --> 22:27.778
When I first got there,
I-I was feeling pretty down.

22:27.780 --> 22:30.114
But then I-I started thinking

22:30.116 --> 22:33.617
about the last few days
with Uncle Albert

22:33.619 --> 22:35.820
and I-I started remembering

22:35.822 --> 22:38.622
some of the things
that you'd said.

22:38.624 --> 22:41.826
[chuckles]
You know, I had to smile..

22:41.828 --> 22:43.627
...because I- I
could see him now

22:43.629 --> 22:46.630
in an entirely different light.

22:46.632 --> 22:50.468
He, he didn't have
a care in the world.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.803
I, I actually felt
happy for him.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.807
Spoken like a true Melmackian.

22:57.643 --> 22:59.009
I'll bet..

22:59.011 --> 23:01.645
...I'll bet
he's up there right now

23:01.647 --> 23:03.714
listening to us.

23:05.017 --> 23:07.551
Uncle Albert..

23:07.553 --> 23:09.653
...thanks for stopping by.

23:12.225 --> 23:15.993
So, ALF,
what are you doing out here?

23:15.995 --> 23:19.430
Well, pondering our place

23:19.432 --> 23:22.233
in the vastness of the universe.

23:23.436 --> 23:24.869
It is humbling.

23:24.871 --> 23:26.504
You know, it's been said

23:26.506 --> 23:27.772
"A man's life is but

23:27.774 --> 23:31.342
a small parenthesis
in eternity."

23:32.578 --> 23:34.612
Looking at the stars..

23:34.614 --> 23:37.248
...makes one realize
how inconsequential

23:37.250 --> 23:39.083
we all really are.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.451
Yeah.

23:40.453 --> 23:43.354
It also gives
one a crick in one's neck.

23:44.457 --> 23:47.358
Could you, uh,
push my head down?

23:50.430 --> 23:52.963
[screams]
A, a snail!

23:56.102 --> 23:57.635
Thanks.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.870
That's more like it.

24:02.608 --> 24:05.843
[theme music]

24:30.570 --> 24:33.204
