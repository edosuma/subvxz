01:59.000 --> 02:00.335
- You like it?
- All right.

02:00.418 --> 02:01.795
I need to go. My dad's here.

02:01.878 --> 02:03.338
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah.

02:11.388 --> 02:13.306
This is the dress. Do you like it?

02:13.390 --> 02:16.518
We've got to hurry. Everyone's going.
There's only two left in my size.

02:18.937 --> 02:20.480
Come on, Dad, let's go.

02:29.823 --> 02:31.241
When do I meet him?

02:32.534 --> 02:33.827
His name's Chappy.

02:33.910 --> 02:34.971
On the football team and very...

02:34.995 --> 02:36.955
- Chubby?
- Chappy.

02:37.747 --> 02:39.547
You'll meet when he picks me up
for the dance.

02:40.125 --> 02:41.125
Not before?

02:41.168 --> 02:43.336
Dad, you really need to go faster.

02:45.672 --> 02:47.299
Will he drive you to the dance?

02:47.674 --> 02:49.176
He's rented a limo.

02:50.093 --> 02:51.469
So he won't drive you?

02:51.928 --> 02:55.515
Limos come with drivers. So stop worrying.

03:01.730 --> 03:04.649
It's a nice dress. You'll be very pretty.

03:05.066 --> 03:06.484
I want you to like it.

03:30.592 --> 03:32.361
- I'm getting out.
- No, no, no. Wait until I park.

03:32.385 --> 03:33.803
Everyone's already inside.

03:34.971 --> 03:37.724
Fan, careful crossing the street!

04:13.301 --> 04:14.301
You stupid...

05:23.663 --> 05:25.206
Metro desk, Ian Wood.

05:25.290 --> 05:26.916
Listen carefully.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.668
An action wing of the Authentic IRA

05:28.752 --> 05:31.713
has just exploded a bomb
at the OBT Bank in Knightsbridge.

05:32.797 --> 05:34.341
The code word is "Phoenix."

05:35.050 --> 05:37.218
Britain's banks are now targets
for the Authentic IRA.

05:37.969 --> 05:41.181
The bombings will continue as long as
Britain's financial criminal institutions

05:41.264 --> 05:44.684
persist in their support of the illegal
occupation of Northern Ireland.

05:52.108 --> 05:54.611
A bomb just went off,
an OBT Bank in Knightsbridge.

05:54.694 --> 05:57.548
A group called the Authentic IRA just
phoned it in. They're claiming credit.

05:57.572 --> 05:58.782
Who's the Authentic IRA?

05:58.948 --> 06:00.116
No idea. Never heard of them.

06:01.326 --> 06:05.121
Christ. There goes the Peace Accord
right back in the shit.

06:05.997 --> 06:09.000
Listen up. A bank has just
been bombed in Knightsbridge.

06:09.084 --> 06:12.754
A group calling itself
the Authentic IRA just phoned it in.

06:12.837 --> 06:14.839
I want to know who they are,
who's behind them.

06:14.923 --> 06:16.841
Call the Met, Sinn Fein,
monitor the blogs.

06:16.925 --> 06:20.053
Is it the IRA or is it something else?
ISIS? Al-Qaeda?

06:20.762 --> 06:22.402
What are you waiting for? Get over there.

06:35.235 --> 06:37.362
...have asked
a number of police officials

06:37.445 --> 06:39.325
for current estimates
on the dead and wounded...

07:30.915 --> 07:33.376
This is a major incident
that they're treating

07:33.460 --> 07:35.587
as a possible terrorist attack.

07:35.670 --> 07:37.881
The bomb went off at exactly...

07:37.964 --> 07:40.049
...4:15 GMT in Knightsbridge.

07:40.133 --> 07:42.218
One theory on the cause of the blast

07:42.302 --> 07:45.096
was that it may have been
a gasoline explosion underground.

07:46.014 --> 07:48.099
How many? How many I get?

07:48.892 --> 07:51.519
Twelve dead so far,
three times as many injured.

07:51.603 --> 07:54.898
The explosion was centered
at the OBT Bank Branch in Knightsbridge.

07:54.981 --> 07:57.692
There was no warning and police
were taken completely by surprise.

07:57.775 --> 07:59.611
Fuck warnings. That'll teach 'em.

08:02.906 --> 08:04.157
Any problems?

08:06.743 --> 08:09.037
- No.
- We should be moving.

08:09.496 --> 08:10.497
That's normal procedure.

08:10.580 --> 08:14.250
Every cop, hotel, and landlady in London
is now looking for the Irishman.

08:15.043 --> 08:19.005
This place is safe,
so long as we stay put.

08:39.484 --> 08:41.778
Could I go to jail
if I murdered your phone?

08:43.530 --> 08:48.368
Destruction of government property?
Absolutely.

08:48.451 --> 08:52.038
Too bad. What's the time?

08:52.455 --> 08:54.958
Almost 10:00. Ten more minutes.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.669
Um, I'll miss my flight.

08:58.545 --> 09:03.925
Let's stay here,
door locked, blinds down...

09:04.592 --> 09:06.302
Room service for a week.

09:07.554 --> 09:08.555
Sound good?

09:08.930 --> 09:10.682
And your work, Deputy Minister?

09:12.058 --> 09:14.060
An acute case of food poisoning.

09:16.938 --> 09:19.107
You need to work on your excuses, darling.

09:42.505 --> 09:44.549
Jesus Christ.

09:45.091 --> 09:47.218
There's been an IRA bombing in London.

09:48.344 --> 09:49.929
Scores dead and injured.

09:58.479 --> 10:00.106
- Yes?
- Jesus, Liam.

10:00.231 --> 10:03.568
Half the world's trying to find you.
Do you even know what's happened?

10:03.651 --> 10:04.902
Yes, yes, yes, I heard.

10:04.986 --> 10:07.322
I've been trying you for hours.
Where've you been?

10:08.197 --> 10:09.115
Meetings.

10:09.198 --> 10:11.200
- Meetings?
- Aye.

10:12.452 --> 10:14.037
And last night?

10:14.746 --> 10:16.748
You didn't come home. I was worried.

10:17.665 --> 10:22.211
Came in late, left early.
Lot of work to catch up on.

10:24.088 --> 10:25.923
But the guest room wasn't slept in.

10:26.007 --> 10:27.550
Who said I slept?

10:27.634 --> 10:28.801
Oh, cut the crap, Liam.

10:29.302 --> 10:30.928
You didn't come home, plain and simple.

10:31.012 --> 10:32.513
And what if I didn't!

10:33.139 --> 10:36.017
Look, I've got a lot to deal with, OK?

10:36.309 --> 10:38.353
So, don't wait up, and don't be worried.

10:40.229 --> 10:43.566
Sunday is the 20th anniversary
of my brother's death.

10:45.276 --> 10:48.029
Saint Mary's is dedicating
a mass to him, so...

10:48.112 --> 10:50.990
I'll have Beth put it in the calendar, OK?
We'll talk later.

10:52.867 --> 10:53.910
Oh, Jesus.

12:26.627 --> 12:29.213
Yes, I understand
the need for swift action.

12:29.297 --> 12:32.341
But until we can identify the threat,
there's not much we can do.

12:32.842 --> 12:35.261
Well, you have your finger
on the pulse over there, Liam.

12:35.344 --> 12:36.554
We're depending on you.

12:36.637 --> 12:40.016
Anything you can provide, anything at all,
would be a tremendous help.

12:40.224 --> 12:41.726
I'm meeting the Council now.

12:41.809 --> 12:44.645
I'll shake the trees as hard
as I can and see what falls.

12:44.729 --> 12:46.772
But, Kate, this is crucial.

12:46.856 --> 12:49.400
We've managed to keep the lid on this
for 19 years now.

12:49.734 --> 12:53.738
But there are new upstarts in the ranks
pressing for the way things were.

12:53.821 --> 12:55.114
I could use something now.

12:55.865 --> 12:57.867
And you know what I'm referring to.

12:58.993 --> 13:00.495
The Royal Pardons.

13:01.954 --> 13:05.124
I remember your list, the 40 "On-the-Runs."
Are we really back to that?

13:05.208 --> 13:07.376
My cousin's on that list.

13:07.502 --> 13:10.588
He hasn't even been convicted
of any paramilitary offenses.

13:10.671 --> 13:14.300
These people are suspects
in many things, including murder.

13:14.383 --> 13:17.678
These people are critical
to holding the peace together now.

13:18.554 --> 13:21.849
A few letters of pardon
would be a small gesture.

13:21.933 --> 13:24.143
We keep it quiet.

13:24.227 --> 13:26.562
But knowing it's been considered,
gives me leeway

13:26.646 --> 13:29.232
to press certain men
for something in return.

13:30.024 --> 13:31.776
As Irish Deputy Minister,

13:31.901 --> 13:33.754
you have served the British
government honorably,

13:33.778 --> 13:35.404
which hasn't always been easy.

13:35.488 --> 13:37.698
But appeasement is a dangerous thing.

13:37.782 --> 13:40.034
These are longstanding issues.

13:40.117 --> 13:42.054
That if addressed now
would smack of appeasement.

13:42.078 --> 13:43.621
I need something, Kate.

13:43.746 --> 13:47.041
The newer members haven't
lived the bloodshed and are easily swayed.

13:47.124 --> 13:49.252
I'm trying to hold this together.

13:49.335 --> 13:52.964
A gesture is all.
It would make a difference.

13:53.673 --> 13:54.882
I'll consider it.

13:57.176 --> 14:00.513
But I want something first,
something real.

14:01.889 --> 14:02.890
Understood.

14:29.333 --> 14:30.334
Hello?

14:37.383 --> 14:39.552
We're closed. We open at 12:00.

14:39.635 --> 14:42.471
Uh, we're looking for the owner,
a Mr. Quin Minh?

14:43.681 --> 14:44.807
Quan.

14:45.308 --> 14:46.434
Upstairs.

14:49.395 --> 14:52.815
They were found on site,
not far from your daughter's body.

14:53.357 --> 14:55.651
Can you positively identify them as hers?

14:57.445 --> 14:58.696
Who did this?

14:59.739 --> 15:02.325
As of now, sir, we don't know,
but we're going to find out.

15:04.118 --> 15:05.369
Why my daughter?

15:07.705 --> 15:09.457
Is there someone we can call

15:09.540 --> 15:11.375
to come and be with you, Mr. Quan?

15:16.881 --> 15:18.341
I have no more family.

15:24.263 --> 15:26.891
These bombers, will you catch them?

15:26.974 --> 15:27.974
Yes.

15:29.310 --> 15:30.978
Will they get punished?

15:31.062 --> 15:32.813
Yes, they certainly will.

15:33.856 --> 15:35.566
We'll let ourselves out.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.169
Ah, good morning, Hugh. Thanks for coming.

15:55.252 --> 15:56.337
Been a long time, Liam.

15:56.420 --> 15:59.131
It's been a long time, indeed.
Go on, take a chair, there.

15:59.840 --> 16:00.883
All right, Hugh?

16:01.384 --> 16:03.010
Now that we're all here,

16:03.719 --> 16:06.847
does anyone know
who this Authentic IRA is?

16:08.808 --> 16:10.685
Are they even part of the IRA?

16:11.769 --> 16:16.273
Some new upstarts
or something else entirely? Hmm?

16:17.441 --> 16:21.237
They're trying to undermine everything
we've achieved over the last 19 years.

16:21.320 --> 16:22.655
Well, I won't have it.

16:22.989 --> 16:26.617
They don't have the support of the people
who said no to the violence.

16:27.201 --> 16:29.161
Our mandate's to uphold that choice

16:29.245 --> 16:31.455
and maintain the Peace Accord
no matter what.

16:31.539 --> 16:32.623
Are we in agreement?

16:32.707 --> 16:35.501
There's a lot of support for their actions
amongst the younger ranks.

16:35.626 --> 16:36.794
Hotheads.

16:37.294 --> 16:40.256
Hotheads who don't remember
or know any better.

16:40.339 --> 16:42.675
You were once one of those hotheads, Liam.

16:43.050 --> 16:44.050
Aye.

16:44.510 --> 16:46.554
Long ago, when it was the only way.

16:46.637 --> 16:47.930
And what did it give us?

16:48.305 --> 16:50.641
More graves than I care to remember.

16:51.225 --> 16:54.228
This bombing rivals Omagh
with its civilian deaths.

16:54.395 --> 16:58.149
It's unacceptable, anytime, anywhere!

16:58.232 --> 17:00.401
And do you think the bombers
come from our ranks?

17:00.484 --> 17:02.528
The Brits ID'd the explosive.

17:03.738 --> 17:06.281
Czech-made Semtex from our dumps.

17:06.866 --> 17:09.160
They also used our code word.

17:09.577 --> 17:12.079
Which means they have
a contact in our command.

17:12.621 --> 17:14.540
Maybe someone in this room.

17:18.794 --> 17:20.796
They're trying to divide us,

17:20.880 --> 17:24.425
put the Brits back on the streets again,
stir up the troubles all over again.

17:24.508 --> 17:25.800
Well, I won't have it!

17:25.885 --> 17:29.305
I want a complete check
of all the arms dumps here and abroad,

17:29.388 --> 17:30.681
everything verified,

17:30.765 --> 17:33.309
guns, Semtex, the whole fuckin' lot.

17:33.392 --> 17:36.395
- Jesus, you can't be serious.
- Never been more so, Patty.

17:36.729 --> 17:38.856
We check 'em, and if something's missing,

17:38.939 --> 17:41.442
we trace it back
to those who knew the location.

17:42.485 --> 17:45.029
And then we deal with this internally.

17:45.279 --> 17:47.656
Unless someone here's got a better idea.

17:47.907 --> 17:49.366
What do we get in return?

17:49.784 --> 17:50.910
Peace.

17:52.661 --> 17:54.163
Is that so bad, Brennan?

17:54.955 --> 17:57.458
Haven't you paid enough in family blood?

17:59.210 --> 18:01.837
So, unless you all
want to trash what we have,

18:01.921 --> 18:04.673
I need your full support and respect.

18:04.757 --> 18:07.635
I want a complete list
of all the stocks within the week,

18:07.718 --> 18:10.763
along with their locations,
and everyone who knows where they are.

18:10.846 --> 18:12.848
And no fuckin' exceptions!

18:26.320 --> 18:27.404
Show me.

18:27.905 --> 18:31.617
We backtracked 47 minutes.
Clearly anticipated the CCTV.

18:31.700 --> 18:34.245
He circled London for quite some time
prior to the bombing.

18:34.328 --> 18:36.330
Now, this is the first
CC feed we have on him.

18:36.831 --> 18:40.334
Heading southbound on the A413
near Wendover at 10:53 a.m.

18:40.918 --> 18:43.462
We retrieved the serial number
from the bike's frame.

18:43.546 --> 18:46.257
It was reported stolen
in Reading the night before.

18:46.340 --> 18:49.510
The license plates were also stolen
from another bike in Reading.

18:49.593 --> 18:51.220
What about phone calls?

18:51.303 --> 18:53.472
Assuming that the bomb
was phone-activated,

18:53.556 --> 18:55.891
we've dumped the five closest towers
to the blast zone

18:55.975 --> 18:57.434
trying to ID any call terminating

18:57.643 --> 18:58.745
at the time of the incident.

18:58.769 --> 18:59.895
Sorry. Excuse me.

19:00.312 --> 19:01.312
Yup.

19:02.898 --> 19:04.024
For you.

19:04.525 --> 19:06.569
- Bromley.
- He's here again, sir.

19:06.694 --> 19:08.863
- The Chinese man.
- What?

19:08.946 --> 19:11.740
The Chinaman.
It's five days in a row, now.

19:11.824 --> 19:13.826
Christ. Tell him I'm busy.

19:13.909 --> 19:16.620
I did, and he said he'd wait, again.

19:18.080 --> 19:22.168
I assure you, this investigation
is our top priority, Mr. Quan.

19:23.085 --> 19:25.629
And we're doing all we can
and pursuing every possible lead

19:25.713 --> 19:27.273
to find those who killed your daughter.

19:32.386 --> 19:34.471
But they're a difficult people to catch.

19:35.347 --> 19:36.765
And it may take some time.

19:37.558 --> 19:39.226
I need you to understand that.

19:39.310 --> 19:41.896
You must catch these men,
Commander Bromley.

19:41.979 --> 19:44.607
Again, it's our top priority.

19:51.697 --> 19:53.490
Twenty thousand pound.

19:55.326 --> 19:58.787
All I have for the names of the bombers.

20:01.290 --> 20:04.501
- I'm sorry, but we can't take this.
- Then please tell me...

20:05.294 --> 20:08.088
Just give me the name
of someone in the IRA.

20:08.172 --> 20:12.635
To be clear, these are vicious men
who take pride in their atrocities.

20:13.302 --> 20:16.764
Any attempt by you to contact them
is likely to end very badly.

20:17.431 --> 20:19.141
This is our work, not yours.

20:20.100 --> 20:21.518
You need to be patient.

20:28.234 --> 20:30.194
How long have you been
in this country, Mr. Quan?

20:31.862 --> 20:35.074
Since 1984. I'm a British citizen.

20:35.699 --> 20:37.952
You were born in Guangxi, China.

20:40.287 --> 20:42.873
Yes. I'm Chinese Nung.

20:42.957 --> 20:45.334
I work in Saigon after the war.

20:45.417 --> 20:46.919
We escaped to Singapore.

20:47.836 --> 20:49.630
Then we immigrate here.

20:51.674 --> 20:53.884
You had two daughters
before Fan.

20:54.802 --> 20:56.887
Both killed during the escape.

20:57.471 --> 20:58.889
And your wife?

20:59.348 --> 21:00.432
Where is she now?

21:03.227 --> 21:05.479
She died, giving birth to Fan.

21:08.774 --> 21:10.609
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

21:13.320 --> 21:16.073
But you mustn't keep coming here
on a daily basis.

21:16.532 --> 21:21.328
It doesn't help, and diverts time
and resources from our investigation.

21:24.164 --> 21:25.374
Do you understand?

21:28.919 --> 21:31.672
Yes. I understand.

21:34.758 --> 21:37.886
Thank you for seeing me,
Commander Bromley.

21:49.064 --> 21:51.275
After three weeks
of investigations,

21:51.358 --> 21:54.153
there's little in the way
of solid leads that I'm aware of.

21:54.236 --> 21:56.405
The public is looking for reassurance.

21:56.864 --> 22:00.200
One leading politician
who somberly may have answers,

22:00.284 --> 22:03.203
lies uncomfortably
at the center of this storm.

22:03.287 --> 22:05.873
We go now to an interview
I recorded earlier in Belfast

22:05.956 --> 22:07.750
with Deputy Minister Liam Hennessy.

22:09.293 --> 22:10.627
Deputy Minister Hennessy,

22:10.711 --> 22:12.671
you've publicly condemned the bombings.

22:12.755 --> 22:14.590
Yet, as a former leader of Sinn Fein

22:14.673 --> 22:16.258
and a member of the IRA,

22:16.342 --> 22:18.886
you took part in similar events years ago.

22:18.969 --> 22:23.265
What's the essential difference between
those acts you were involved in then

22:23.349 --> 22:25.434
and what's happened in London recently?

22:25.517 --> 22:29.313
Hope. We had none,
just years of vengeance.

22:30.564 --> 22:32.524
We needed to break the cycle,

22:32.608 --> 22:35.736
so we committed
to a political path which lead to...

22:35.819 --> 22:37.219
I've made you tea.

22:38.405 --> 22:39.990
So, if you say "hope,"

22:40.074 --> 22:43.410
why are these IRA men,
who come from your own ranks,

22:43.494 --> 22:45.412
returning to the bombings?

22:45.496 --> 22:50.042
I can say with reasonable certainty
that the IRA are not behind this.

22:50.250 --> 22:53.378
They stand firmly behind
the agreement and the promises...

22:53.462 --> 22:55.231
You can't be like this anymore.

22:55.255 --> 22:56.799
You should eat something.

22:58.884 --> 23:00.427
I'm getting you some noodles.

23:03.764 --> 23:06.391
So, you're saying
possibly it's a financial problem

23:06.475 --> 23:07.976
rather than a political one.

23:08.727 --> 23:12.022
People look for scapegoats, for a way out.

23:12.106 --> 23:14.066
And for some, they are more than happy

23:14.149 --> 23:17.361
to resort to violence,
to upset the status quo.

23:24.368 --> 23:28.539
Prepared for your signature.
They absolutely must be signed now.

23:28.622 --> 23:31.166
What's the latest reaction
on social media?

23:31.250 --> 23:33.627
Same as before. Fear and anger.

23:33.710 --> 23:35.045
Anger directed at whom?

23:35.129 --> 23:37.172
From the Prime Minister on down.

23:37.673 --> 23:39.967
CNN and The Irish Times
want interviews with you.

23:40.134 --> 23:42.052
You can do tonight
or tomorrow morning at 8:00.

23:42.136 --> 23:44.346
Tomorrow morning by phone. What else?

23:44.763 --> 23:46.515
You've a call waitin' on Line Two.

23:46.598 --> 23:48.851
- Waiting?
- For 30 minutes now.

23:48.934 --> 23:51.812
A Mr. Quan from London, very insistent.

23:51.895 --> 23:55.107
- What does he want?
- His daughter was killed in the bombing.

23:55.190 --> 23:58.277
I tried my best to console him,
but he really just wants to speak to you.

23:58.360 --> 24:01.363
- He saw ya on TV.
- Oh, Christ, Beth.

24:01.446 --> 24:03.824
Civic duty. Take it and be done.

24:09.163 --> 24:11.874
This is Liam Hennessy. How may I help you?

24:11.957 --> 24:15.294
Mr. Hennessy,
tell me who killed my daughter?

24:15.544 --> 24:18.755
What on Earth makes you think
I know who killed your daughter?

24:19.381 --> 24:21.884
Because, you are the First Deputy Minister

24:22.050 --> 24:25.679
and advisor to Sinn Fein,
and a former IRA member.

24:26.555 --> 24:30.392
I am truly sad for your loss, Mr. Quan.
I have a daughter myself.

24:30.475 --> 24:33.478
And I condemn these acts of violence,
but I can't help you.

24:33.812 --> 24:35.272
Then please tell me someone

24:35.355 --> 24:38.650
who might know the names of the bombers,
someone I can talk to.

24:39.776 --> 24:43.030
I don't have any connections
to those sorts of people. I'm sorry.

24:43.113 --> 24:45.199
I don't believe you, Mr. Hennessy.

24:45.282 --> 24:47.284
You are very powerful man.

24:47.367 --> 24:50.704
Well, I work for the government
and our elected officials.

24:50.787 --> 24:52.706
I do not work for terrorists.

24:53.165 --> 24:57.502
IRA politics and terrorism
are different ends of the same snake.

24:58.086 --> 25:00.380
Whichever end you grab,
you still grab a snake.

25:00.589 --> 25:03.091
It makes a great deal
of difference which end you grab,

25:03.175 --> 25:04.885
because one end will bite.

25:05.677 --> 25:09.598
Again, I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Quan.

25:09.681 --> 25:10.682
Good day.

26:02.150 --> 26:03.590
What are you doing?

26:05.279 --> 26:07.197
You have to stop this.

26:10.659 --> 26:12.369
This wasn't your fault.

26:14.621 --> 26:16.623
I failed them.

26:22.379 --> 26:23.755
What's this?

26:24.089 --> 26:26.883
The restaurant is now yours.

26:27.592 --> 26:30.762
You've been a good friend to me, Lam.

26:32.264 --> 26:33.682
No more of this talk.

26:35.017 --> 26:36.101
Look at me.

26:40.230 --> 26:43.275
I'm not going home. I'm staying the night.
I will sleep on the couch.

26:43.483 --> 26:45.902
And on Monday,
I'm taking you to see someone.

26:46.028 --> 26:48.947
Someone to help you.
But no more of this talk. OK?

26:53.660 --> 26:56.830
Quan!

28:03.980 --> 28:07.067
I've been calling you
all night. Where were you?

28:07.442 --> 28:08.902
What are you going to do?

28:10.946 --> 28:12.155
When will you come back?

29:22.601 --> 29:23.977
You have a room?

29:24.060 --> 29:27.147
These are important documents
that we must have today.

29:27.981 --> 29:29.816
Yes, I will keep trying
the sender because,

29:29.900 --> 29:32.652
apparently there's nothing else I can do,
which I find strange

29:32.736 --> 29:35.280
and certainly not the service
I've come to expect.

29:36.323 --> 29:40.494
Yes, 329174-N for November.

29:41.661 --> 29:43.997
You tell your supervisor
I'll be calling back.

29:44.206 --> 29:45.207
Good day.

29:46.708 --> 29:48.210
Yes? May I help you?

29:48.585 --> 29:51.004
Please, I would like to
speak to Mr. Hennessy.

29:51.171 --> 29:53.381
- And your name?
- Ngoc Minh Quan.

29:54.299 --> 29:55.659
You're the one who's been phoning.

29:55.967 --> 29:57.594
Yes. I phoned many times.

29:58.595 --> 30:01.306
I'm afraid the Deputy Minister is busy
and won't be able to see you.

30:02.557 --> 30:05.143
- I will wait.
- No, you must leave.

30:05.727 --> 30:07.395
Best do as the lady says.

30:07.979 --> 30:10.315
He's been phoning up
at all hours asking for Liam.

30:10.440 --> 30:11.316
He won't take no for an answer.

30:11.399 --> 30:12.442
Just groceries.

30:14.653 --> 30:17.322
Go now, before we make ya.

30:19.199 --> 30:21.326
- No. I'm wait.
- Right.

30:27.999 --> 30:30.252
It's the man who's been
phoning you from London.

30:30.335 --> 30:33.213
He's got a knife on him.
One of those Swiss Army types.

30:34.464 --> 30:36.424
Well, take it off him.

30:36.842 --> 30:39.886
Jesus, how much damage
can he do with you two around?

30:40.220 --> 30:41.304
Let him be.

30:42.180 --> 30:43.699
As I explained before...

30:43.723 --> 30:45.809
...I don't know who the bombers are.

30:45.892 --> 30:48.728
I realize you're angry,
but there's not much I can do.

30:48.979 --> 30:51.356
It's also very dangerous
for you to be here.

30:52.482 --> 30:56.027
People in Belfast
won't take kindly to your accusations.

30:56.778 --> 30:58.530
If you do not know who they are,

30:59.573 --> 31:01.324
I would like you to please find out.

31:07.163 --> 31:09.875
I haven't been affiliated
with the IRA for 30 years.

31:09.958 --> 31:13.086
When I was,
I fought hard against the violence.

31:13.169 --> 31:15.380
I went to prison
for what I did and paid my debt.

31:16.172 --> 31:18.925
Now I serve the politics of both sides,

31:19.009 --> 31:21.428
trying to heal the wounds
and bridge the divide.

31:22.762 --> 31:28.184
Again, my sincere condolences,
but there's nothing I can do.

31:28.935 --> 31:31.938
What if your wife and daughter
were killed by bomb?

31:34.566 --> 31:37.319
I'd do everything in my power
to get justice.

31:37.694 --> 31:41.072
So, I've chosen you, Mr. Hennessy.

31:41.656 --> 31:43.992
You will tell me who killed my child.

31:44.075 --> 31:47.412
Again, I don't know.

31:51.041 --> 31:52.584
You will change your mind.

31:56.087 --> 31:59.090
Thank you for seeing me,
First Minister Hennessy.

33:14.207 --> 33:16.710
I'm sorry, Liam. He took me by surprise.

33:26.511 --> 33:29.180
You're OK, Beth. OK, you're OK.

33:29.264 --> 33:30.974
Take her, take her.

33:31.057 --> 33:33.643
- Murphy, have the boys check the building.
- Right.

33:34.019 --> 33:35.020
Jesus.

33:47.949 --> 33:49.701
Would you like a whiskey, Inspector?

33:50.285 --> 33:51.953
No, thank you.

33:55.540 --> 33:58.626
I suppose it would be a waste of time
asking who might've done this.

34:00.003 --> 34:01.755
No one comes to mind.

34:03.089 --> 34:06.760
Well, it appears to have been
nothing more than a warning.

34:07.135 --> 34:09.094
Fortunately, it wasn't a serious bomb.

34:09.804 --> 34:12.139
If it had been, we wouldn't
be here talking, would we?

34:13.891 --> 34:17.896
Feel free to reach out,
should you have the unexpected urge.

34:19.105 --> 34:21.690
I'll feed the press a gas leak story
in the meantime.

34:22.275 --> 34:24.985
Fair enough. Thanks very much, Inspector.

34:27.739 --> 34:28.739
Hello?

34:31.534 --> 34:32.534
It's him.

34:38.708 --> 34:41.503
You come to my office
and plant a fucking bomb?

34:41.753 --> 34:43.963
- Have you changed your mind?
- Changed my mind?

34:44.047 --> 34:46.132
Are you out of your fuckin' tree?

34:46.216 --> 34:48.342
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

34:48.426 --> 34:49.636
But you'll soon find out.

34:49.719 --> 34:50.887
Give me the names.

34:50.969 --> 34:53.514
I'll tell you what.
Let's meet face-to-face.

34:53.598 --> 34:54.598
We'll settle...

34:56.434 --> 34:58.937
The fuckin' wanker
threatened me and hung up.

35:02.107 --> 35:04.859
Right. Let's check all the hotels
and guest houses.

35:04.943 --> 35:06.402
He won't be hard to find.

35:08.988 --> 35:10.031
Fuckin' Chinaman.

35:14.327 --> 35:16.037
Uncle Liam? What's up?

35:21.292 --> 35:22.293
I'll be there.

36:33.907 --> 36:36.409
Stop! Hold it, hold it,
hold it! Don't move!

36:36.492 --> 36:39.704
Don't move! She's wired to blow!

37:18.034 --> 37:20.328
Two sets of wires
ten-foot long,

37:20.411 --> 37:23.122
soldered to that light bulb
and covered with ground-up match heads.

37:23.957 --> 37:25.750
Gives an extra kick.

37:26.125 --> 37:28.211
Not needed, but a nice touch.

37:28.711 --> 37:30.838
Crude, effective, and easy to spot.

37:30.922 --> 37:32.507
So, he wanted us to see it.

37:32.674 --> 37:35.236
Well, it wasn't in the tank,
so it wouldn't have worked.

37:35.260 --> 37:37.053
He just wants you to know
he can get to ya.

37:39.597 --> 37:40.598
Micky.

37:41.933 --> 37:44.978
We found him.
A B&amp;B in Wellington Park.

37:45.770 --> 37:47.438
- They found him.
- Grab him.

37:47.522 --> 37:50.817
Drag him out of Belfast.
Discourage him from returning.

37:51.317 --> 37:52.670
Wait for me. I'm on my way.

37:54.612 --> 37:56.281
Hello.

37:56.364 --> 37:58.574
I hear your office was bombed.

37:58.658 --> 38:02.036
Hardly.
It was the toilet in the hall.

38:02.370 --> 38:04.789
An Asian man in his 60s with a grudge.

38:05.039 --> 38:06.291
It's all being taken care of.

38:06.499 --> 38:07.500
Why'd he do it?

38:07.583 --> 38:11.170
His child died in the bank bombing.
He thinks I know who did it.

38:11.254 --> 38:13.131
He's not the only one of that mind.

38:13.423 --> 38:16.926
- So, where are we with the pardons?
- Lots of resistance.

38:17.093 --> 38:20.555
But, if you give us something useful,
things might turn in your favor.

38:20.722 --> 38:23.391
I may have a lead. I'm pursuing it.

38:24.892 --> 38:27.979
Well, let's hope it bears fruit.
People here want heads.

38:28.438 --> 38:30.773
The dogs won't stay leashed much longer.

38:42.702 --> 38:44.037
Top floor on the right.

40:51.080 --> 40:52.582
Fuckin' get him!

41:18.316 --> 41:21.235
Christ Almighty,
are you dumb and blind?

41:21.527 --> 41:23.696
An old man making fools
out of the lot of you

41:23.779 --> 41:26.491
and he's still running around
out there, for God's sake.

41:26.574 --> 41:28.826
You are four men. Four.

41:28.910 --> 41:30.870
We had him cornered,
then he jumped off the roof

41:30.953 --> 41:32.705
and slid down like some fuckin' monkey.

41:32.788 --> 41:33.831
What is goin' on?

41:36.542 --> 41:39.045
Pack your bag. You're going to the farm.

41:40.463 --> 41:41.464
Go on.

41:42.048 --> 41:43.216
Get your things.

41:47.803 --> 41:49.643
- You all right, Sean?
- Hi, Christy.

41:49.889 --> 41:51.307
Go on through, he's expecting ya.

41:55.603 --> 41:58.606
Beat ya up. Come on in
and have a drink, for God's sake.

41:58.689 --> 42:00.233
Well, look at ya.

42:00.316 --> 42:02.252
- Jesus, the place looks well.
- It's not bad, is it?

42:02.276 --> 42:04.276
- No.
- You're a sight for sore eyes.

42:04.320 --> 42:05.821
So, how is New York treatin' ya?

42:05.905 --> 42:08.991
- Ah, it's cold.
- Uh-huh.

42:09.659 --> 42:12.954
Look, Murphy filled me in, there.
That bloody Chinaman.

42:13.037 --> 42:15.498
He set off a bomb in my office,

42:15.581 --> 42:18.167
put one in my Jag, and beat the bejesus
out of Mick and Jimmy.

42:18.251 --> 42:23.839
- Do you want me to handle him?
- No. That's Kavanagh's problem.

42:25.716 --> 42:28.636
I need your help with the London bombing.

42:30.263 --> 42:32.014
Any idea who's behind it yet?

42:34.308 --> 42:35.309
Not at all.

42:36.477 --> 42:38.604
- Well, the Yanks aren't happy, Liam.
- Mm...

42:38.688 --> 42:40.374
Dead women and kids
all over the news.

42:40.398 --> 42:41.941
Any fundraising now is impossible.

42:42.024 --> 42:44.860
Yeah, this is not about fundraising, Sean.

42:44.944 --> 42:47.196
I need you to go to London
and meet someone...

42:48.281 --> 42:51.784
A Richard Bromley in SO15.

42:53.160 --> 42:54.203
SO15?

42:54.287 --> 42:56.539
He needs to know the bombings aren't ours,

42:56.622 --> 42:59.750
and that we're working the problem hard,
but we need his help.

43:00.001 --> 43:00.835
Why me?

43:00.918 --> 43:03.754
You're a decorated Ranger
in the Royal Irish Regiment.

43:04.380 --> 43:08.301
Bromley will respect you as much
as he's capable of respecting any of us.

43:09.135 --> 43:12.722
Should anyone find out
that we're talking to the Brits,

43:12.805 --> 43:15.891
to go after one of our own, rogue or not,

43:16.559 --> 43:18.060
there'll be the devil to pay.

43:20.021 --> 43:21.814
So, can I count on you, Sean...

43:22.398 --> 43:24.066
to be discreet?

43:25.610 --> 43:26.861
Of course.

44:12.907 --> 44:14.241
Right this way, sir.

44:14.325 --> 44:15.326
Thank you very much.

44:26.629 --> 44:27.755
You took your time.

44:28.839 --> 44:31.717
I just had to put out
the odd fire here and there.

44:38.849 --> 44:39.975
I'll be back in a minute.

44:40.059 --> 44:41.060
I'll be right here.

44:55.032 --> 44:56.032
Jesus.

45:24.437 --> 45:25.479
Mr. Morrison.

45:29.316 --> 45:30.693
Commander Bromley.

45:33.028 --> 45:35.197
- We're not responsible.
- Really?

45:35.281 --> 45:38.200
Forensic evidence and the use
of your code word suggests otherwise.

45:38.325 --> 45:40.995
It's a renegade unit.
We don't know who they are yet.

45:41.078 --> 45:42.913
You're telling me
there's an active IRA unit

45:42.997 --> 45:44.307
on the loose you know nothing about?

45:44.331 --> 45:45.331
Yes, I am.

45:45.624 --> 45:46.917
And the Semtex?

45:47.418 --> 45:48.728
They're raiding our dumps.

45:48.752 --> 45:50.872
Dumps that were
all given up for the Accord?

45:51.422 --> 45:52.840
And your code word?

45:52.923 --> 45:55.885
They're being helped by someone
in our command, Belfast or Dublin.

45:55.968 --> 45:57.511
So, what do you want, Mr. Morrison?

45:58.512 --> 45:59.805
We've a plan.

45:59.889 --> 46:02.308
Different codes will be given
to each member of command.

46:02.433 --> 46:04.327
When the bombers claim credit
for the next attack,

46:04.351 --> 46:06.187
you'll tell us which word they use.

46:06.687 --> 46:08.457
Then we'll know who gave
the orders and then we end it.

46:08.481 --> 46:10.065
Who else is involved in this plan?

46:10.316 --> 46:11.609
Liam Hennessy.

46:11.901 --> 46:14.153
So, you can appreciate
the need for discretion.

46:14.236 --> 46:15.996
Only Liam knows
who will be given which word.

46:16.030 --> 46:18.866
So, Hennessy will personally work with us
to take out an IRA cell?

46:18.949 --> 46:21.202
- A rogue cell.
- Your people, nonetheless.

46:23.746 --> 46:25.080
I've one condition.

46:27.166 --> 46:29.752
When Hennessy finds the bombers,
he tells me directly.

46:30.085 --> 46:32.588
Then we take them down. Not you.

46:33.714 --> 46:35.299
This is non-negotiable.

47:00.199 --> 47:01.759
We found some plastic bags in his room.

47:02.451 --> 47:04.954
Based on what I saw,
he's brewed up some nitroglycerin,

47:05.037 --> 47:08.332
mixed it with weed killer, packed it
into some plastic plumbing pipes.

47:08.624 --> 47:10.167
How much damage can he do?

47:10.251 --> 47:13.671
I'm guessing he's made four bombs,
each enough to blow up a lorry.

47:13.754 --> 47:14.755
Jesus.

47:14.838 --> 47:17.800
Knows what he's doing.
I've half the city looking for him.

47:17.883 --> 47:20.427
When he surfaces in Belfast,
we'll find him.

47:21.303 --> 47:22.596
You'll be safe here.

47:23.430 --> 47:27.142
Aye. I wouldn't count on it.

49:34.478 --> 49:35.479
Benny!

50:47.926 --> 50:49.845
Jesus Christ!

50:51.930 --> 50:53.557
Move it! Move it!

51:05.277 --> 51:09.782
Jesus. He roughed up Benny and Sean.
They'll be fine.

51:10.115 --> 51:12.201
Get more men from Belfast.

51:12.451 --> 51:15.746
I've underestimated him.
It won't happen again.

51:28.884 --> 51:30.219
It's another warning, Liam?

51:30.302 --> 51:33.138
Aye. Nothing I can't handle.

51:33.472 --> 51:35.641
First Belfast, now here.

51:35.724 --> 51:37.601
How in God's name
are you handling anything?

51:37.851 --> 51:39.394
The problem's being dealt with.

51:40.145 --> 51:42.272
He is destroying our farmhouse,

51:42.356 --> 51:45.317
intent on God knows what,
and you're calling it a problem?

51:46.068 --> 51:48.529
God, you can be so pompous sometimes.

51:48.612 --> 51:51.156
I'm leaving for London.
Gonna stay at Keri's.

51:51.240 --> 51:52.616
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

51:52.699 --> 51:55.118
Well, I wasn't asking for your permission.

51:55.202 --> 51:58.121
He's hardly likely to know
about our daughter's flat, and besides,

51:58.205 --> 51:59.623
it's you he's after, not me.

51:59.706 --> 52:01.643
Well, the point is,
if he knows about the farmhouse,

52:01.667 --> 52:04.294
I assume he knows about Keri's flat.

52:04.378 --> 52:05.546
It's not worth the risk.

52:05.629 --> 52:08.069
Well then, you're just gonna
have to handle it, like you said.

52:10.008 --> 52:13.637
I remember a time when you would've
dealt with this, properly,

52:13.720 --> 52:15.138
and other things, too.

52:16.181 --> 52:17.641
But those days are gone.

52:50.424 --> 52:52.509
Weighs a bit more,
but shouldn't be noticeable.

52:53.635 --> 52:56.638
All I'm adding is the Semtex,
a micro-chip and a few inches of wire.

52:57.639 --> 52:58.473
It looks good.

52:58.599 --> 53:02.394
Tricky part will be getting it through
the scanner, but, we'll find a way.

53:02.728 --> 53:03.854
And if it's turned on?

53:04.688 --> 53:07.316
Shorter battery life,
but it'll work, no problem.

53:07.399 --> 53:08.650
Any idea which plane yet?

53:08.734 --> 53:12.321
No. We don't want to hit a flight
with any Irish on board.

53:12.571 --> 53:15.949
One in the queen's fleet'd be best.
We just need the right mule.

53:20.329 --> 53:21.955
Code word has changed...

53:22.956 --> 53:24.291
As of tonight.

53:27.294 --> 53:29.379
My news editor's a complete twat.

53:29.463 --> 53:33.133
Spends as much on a pair of shoes as I get
for eight hours writing crap like this.

53:33.216 --> 53:34.217
Makes perfect sense.

53:35.010 --> 53:37.346
Who doesn't like a new pair of sexy shoes?

53:37.846 --> 53:41.391
You should try a real whiskey.
Two Jamesons, single malt.

53:44.478 --> 53:47.481
"Wife Attacks
Husband's Transgender Lover."

53:47.648 --> 53:49.399
Some serious news you're writing there.

53:49.858 --> 53:52.945
Well, if it pays, I'll write it.

53:53.028 --> 53:54.748
Beats being knee-deep
in a bloody bomb site.

53:55.822 --> 53:58.325
- So, what do you do?
- Wealth management.

54:07.834 --> 54:08.877
I'm Maggie.

54:09.086 --> 54:10.212
Ian.

54:15.133 --> 54:17.052
All right.
I'll call if we need more.

54:17.177 --> 54:19.217
- Thanks, Mary.
- All right, thanks. Bye.

54:21.056 --> 54:23.392
Six more men
are on their way from Belfast.

54:23.475 --> 54:25.662
When they get here, they'll relieve
the fellas who've been up all night.

54:25.686 --> 54:26.829
Is it enough to secure the farm?

54:26.853 --> 54:30.273
Secure as it can be.
It's 20 total working two shifts.

54:31.692 --> 54:34.277
All right. You're flying
to London today with Mary.

54:34.361 --> 54:36.005
- Right, yeah.
- That's completely unnecessary.

54:36.029 --> 54:38.615
Get her into Keri's flat,
then move them into a hotel.

54:38.699 --> 54:40.117
I can manage this, all right?

54:40.200 --> 54:41.702
I'll not be debating this!

54:42.494 --> 54:44.329
Nick's gonna fill up the Jag.

54:44.413 --> 54:45.872
You're leaving...

55:04.474 --> 55:05.754
Take him to the hospital.

55:06.018 --> 55:08.395
- Get Mary to the airport. Go.
- Right.

55:14.860 --> 55:17.404
Buried nitro bomb, detonated by remote.

55:19.156 --> 55:20.699
He needed a line of sight.

55:21.658 --> 55:23.660
Those woods, that's where I'd be.

55:24.619 --> 55:27.539
- Go.
- Sean! Mick! Get in the car.

55:27.622 --> 55:28.790
Go, go, go!

55:50.270 --> 55:51.563
Come on. Go, go, go!

55:58.028 --> 56:01.198
You guys spread out.
I'll take the high ground.

56:52.541 --> 56:53.583
Names!

57:21.027 --> 57:22.571
Jesus Christ!

57:22.988 --> 57:25.448
One ol' man running circles
around the lot of us.

57:26.658 --> 57:27.659
Why is it so hard?

57:28.493 --> 57:30.620
He's ahead of us every step of the way.

57:31.663 --> 57:32.663
We need more men.

57:33.039 --> 57:34.833
We need 100 more men, at least.

57:34.958 --> 57:37.752
And if we did that,
we'd have the whole of Belfast against us.

57:40.505 --> 57:43.550
Bring in a tracker,
someone who knows the woods,

57:43.633 --> 57:45.051
and beat him at his own game.

57:46.386 --> 57:47.804
My nephew?

57:47.888 --> 57:50.515
Aye. If you can spare him.

58:19.920 --> 58:21.004
Come on.

58:29.137 --> 58:30.847
How's Keri? Where is she?

58:30.931 --> 58:31.932
Out.

58:33.225 --> 58:35.060
You're a wee bit early,
but I'm nearly ready.

58:35.727 --> 58:37.938
Have you a restaurant in mind?

58:38.021 --> 58:39.731
Haven't given it much thought.

58:41.983 --> 58:45.070
So, what urgencies
bring my nephew all the way to London?

58:46.530 --> 58:47.656
A few personal matters.

58:48.990 --> 58:50.784
I'm glad I made the list.

58:53.537 --> 58:55.789
Mm. I think that works.

58:56.456 --> 58:57.749
What do you think?

59:22.857 --> 59:24.734
You've gotta be kiddin'.

59:29.781 --> 59:32.951
- Liam?
- Tell Bromley I'll accept his terms.

59:33.451 --> 59:34.578
I'll pass it on.

59:34.661 --> 59:37.205
I've given out the code words.
Now we wait.

59:38.999 --> 59:40.709
Quan hit us again.

59:41.668 --> 59:43.962
Blew up the Jag,
put Billy in the hospital.

59:44.212 --> 59:45.839
Kavanagh and the boys went after him.

59:46.089 --> 59:50.218
The wee shitey injured three more men.
Punji sticks, if you can believe that.

59:50.302 --> 59:53.555
Liam, it sounds like he's trained.
Maybe Special Forces.

59:53.638 --> 59:55.078
Which brings me to the point.

59:55.265 --> 59:58.852
I need a tracker, Sean.
Can you give us a hand?

59:59.728 --> 01:00:01.980
- I'll take a morning flight.
- Good man.

01:00:10.322 --> 01:00:14.492
Hey. How'd he sound?

01:00:16.244 --> 01:00:17.329
Worried.

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.123
He's got a lot going on.

01:00:20.373 --> 01:00:22.573
Well, if he doesn't
find the bombers, the Accord's dead.

01:00:22.792 --> 01:00:24.502
And politically, so's he.

01:00:27.088 --> 01:00:28.548
Do you think he'll find them?

01:00:29.758 --> 01:00:31.092
Yeah, if there's another blast.

01:00:33.303 --> 01:00:35.347
The code word will lead us to
who's running them.

01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:38.016
He's finished.
The code word won't save him.

01:00:39.267 --> 01:00:41.519
What the Council needs is new blood...

01:00:42.228 --> 01:00:44.439
someone stronger, like you.

01:00:45.774 --> 01:00:47.776
He's afraid to use his power.

01:00:47.859 --> 01:00:51.237
He's just a washed-up old man
trying to hold onto whatever he can.

01:00:56.618 --> 01:00:59.371
I've never forgiven him
for my brother Patrick.

01:01:00.497 --> 01:01:02.415
Liam found out who killed him.

01:01:03.958 --> 01:01:07.712
A UVF death squad. Four men.

01:01:09.839 --> 01:01:13.551
I told Liam to kill them
before they got to court.

01:01:13.635 --> 01:01:15.136
But he said no.

01:01:16.012 --> 01:01:18.348
That the time for revenge is past.

01:01:19.891 --> 01:01:22.936
So, my Patrick is dead and buried,

01:01:23.019 --> 01:01:26.231
and they're sitting in jail now,
all four of them,

01:01:26.314 --> 01:01:28.525
taking classes at the open university.

01:01:29.776 --> 01:01:33.947
It's not right. It's not.

01:04:13.481 --> 01:04:15.066
Hugh McGrath's here.

01:04:22.073 --> 01:04:24.117
I heard you're checking my dumps.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:27.245
We're checking everyone's. No exceptions.

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:29.914
Four came up short. Two were yours.

01:04:30.373 --> 01:04:32.041
Ten kilos of Semtex missing.

01:04:32.125 --> 01:04:35.670
What in God's name are you doing?
My dumps were off-limits.

01:04:35.753 --> 01:04:37.046
We were clear in that. Remember?

01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:38.381
You were at the meeting.

01:04:38.923 --> 01:04:40.943
If you knew they were short,
you should've handled it.

01:04:40.967 --> 01:04:44.554
They were in perfect order.
I checked 'em myself, and that's a fact.

01:04:47.515 --> 01:04:50.476
Christ, Liam, so the committee
knows it's my Semtex?

01:04:54.814 --> 01:04:58.026
Don't know who we can
trust anymore. Do we?

01:04:58.526 --> 01:05:00.028
Trust, or fear?

01:05:01.195 --> 01:05:03.323
In your case, mostly fear.

01:05:03.781 --> 01:05:05.742
Simple and brutal, like my da taught me.

01:05:07.744 --> 01:05:11.664
Look, we have an opportunity here, Liam,
if you take the lead.

01:05:11.873 --> 01:05:13.313
This Chinaman isn't helping matters,

01:05:13.374 --> 01:05:14.935
but let me get some locals
to hunt him down.

01:05:14.959 --> 01:05:16.878
- How much do you know?
- Plenty.

01:05:16.961 --> 01:05:19.422
Bomb in your office. Your farm. Your car.

01:05:19.505 --> 01:05:22.467
Mary and your daughter hiding out
in a London hotel, a bloody mess, it is.

01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:25.887
And the men sense weakness, as do the UVF.

01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:29.641
You should be back in Belfast,
out in front, taking charge.

01:05:29.933 --> 01:05:32.685
- Look, I'm no politician...
- What're you trying to say?

01:05:33.561 --> 01:05:34.812
The bombing.

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:39.734
A few quiet words of encouragement
would soothe the ranks.

01:05:40.026 --> 01:05:41.235
"Encouragement"?

01:05:41.444 --> 01:05:42.987
They kill civilians by the buckets.

01:05:43.071 --> 01:05:47.283
They went a bit far, I know,
but they have given us real momentum.

01:05:47.367 --> 01:05:48.743
The Brits are on the ropes.

01:05:48.826 --> 01:05:52.872
Jesus Christ, I said hit a few
financial targets. That's it.

01:05:52.956 --> 01:05:55.541
No one gets hurt.
That's what we agreed to.

01:05:55.625 --> 01:05:58.670
- You gave me your word.
- And by God, I kept it.

01:05:58.753 --> 01:06:02.340
I don't know who they are,
don't even know who's controlling 'em.

01:06:02.423 --> 01:06:03.716
And that's the way it has to be.

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.844
Because, if something goes wrong,
they could trace 'em straight back to us.

01:06:06.928 --> 01:06:11.015
Go wrong? This wasn't the fuckin' plan.
I needed this to get our people back.

01:06:11.224 --> 01:06:15.687
- You and I have spent our whole lifetime...
- You don't give a shit about those men.

01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:17.981
You needed the bombing
to shore up the election,

01:06:18.064 --> 01:06:19.941
to prop up your weakness in the ranks.

01:06:20.024 --> 01:06:24.904
Well, guess what?
In the fog o' war, plans fuckin' change.

01:06:26.155 --> 01:06:30.118
Now, I stood by you
when you put fire into the lads.

01:06:30.201 --> 01:06:33.329
M62, Aldershot, Mountbatten.

01:06:33.413 --> 01:06:35.623
You were calling for an escalation then,
right enough.

01:06:35.707 --> 01:06:37.959
Those days are long gone!

01:06:39.002 --> 01:06:41.504
That's not what I heard a few months ago.

01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:47.427
I heard the old Liam,
a man back on track with a plan.

01:06:49.971 --> 01:06:52.765
You haven't forgotten
what we're fighting for, have ya?

01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:54.767
You question my loyalty?

01:06:55.601 --> 01:06:59.814
I buried my brother-in-law,
before that my da and my two cousins.

01:06:59.897 --> 01:07:03.276
We spilt our fair share of blood
struggling for united Ireland,

01:07:03.359 --> 01:07:05.403
not profiting off a divided one.

01:07:05.486 --> 01:07:08.606
So, don't fucking go asking me again
if I've forgotten what we're fighting for.

01:07:08.656 --> 01:07:11.136
If there's anyone profiteering
around here, it's you,

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:15.663
sitting in your fancy houses,
cozying up to the Brits.

01:07:16.456 --> 01:07:18.082
You're not the Liam I once knew.

01:07:18.166 --> 01:07:19.667
You want the old me, huh?

01:07:19.917 --> 01:07:22.587
The Butcher of the Bogside,
is that what you want?

01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:23.838
Well then, hear this.

01:07:23.921 --> 01:07:26.090
You reel in those fuckin' cunts
and end it,

01:07:26.174 --> 01:07:28.843
or by God, I'll bury the lot of yas.

01:07:30.803 --> 01:07:33.848
Right. I'm going now.

01:07:34.057 --> 01:07:35.892
I'll be at my farm if you need me.

01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:39.520
And take care of that Committee issue.

01:07:39.604 --> 01:07:43.941
We don't want them jumping to the wrong
conclusion about that Semtex. Do we?

01:07:50.198 --> 01:07:51.449
Yeah.

01:07:55.578 --> 01:07:58.331
Do you or any of the men know
where Mary's staying in London?

01:07:58.414 --> 01:08:00.333
No. No one, but Murphy.

01:08:00.416 --> 01:08:02.877
Hmm. McGrath knows where she's hiding.

01:08:04.003 --> 01:08:05.630
I wanna know how.

01:08:24.398 --> 01:08:27.234
What a day, Charlie.

01:08:28.444 --> 01:08:30.822
What a day. Come on now, let's go.

01:08:36.327 --> 01:08:37.787
Come on, Charlie, up you get.

01:08:38.830 --> 01:08:39.830
Charlie.

01:09:11.529 --> 01:09:12.697
You killed my dog?

01:09:13.029 --> 01:09:15.241
Dog's fine. Just sleeping.

01:09:16.325 --> 01:09:17.410
Sit.

01:09:26.335 --> 01:09:27.420
I'm wearing a bomb.

01:09:28.379 --> 01:09:32.675
Anyone comes in,
I touch it one, then we die.

01:09:32.758 --> 01:09:33.759
Now, give me the names.

01:09:33.843 --> 01:09:37.638
They claim they're the IRA,
but I don't know who they really are.

01:09:37.721 --> 01:09:40.349
I'm doing everything I can
to find out who's responsible.

01:09:40.433 --> 01:09:41.743
You're lying! Who killed my daughter?

01:09:41.767 --> 01:09:44.437
I'm sorry. I truly don't know yet.

01:09:51.027 --> 01:09:53.946
The explosives the bombers use,
it's Semtex-H?

01:09:54.322 --> 01:09:57.700
Yes. Yes. You know about Semtex?

01:09:58.743 --> 01:10:00.203
I know Semtex-H.

01:10:00.703 --> 01:10:03.331
During the war,
Czechs make for the Viet Cong.

01:10:03.414 --> 01:10:04.707
Good for bombs and traps.

01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:06.626
- In Vietnam?
- Yes.

01:10:07.335 --> 01:10:10.129
Many American people died by Semtex-H.

01:10:10.213 --> 01:10:13.049
Now, IRA use to kill my daughter.

01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:15.509
That's ironic.

01:10:16.761 --> 01:10:20.681
I've read your history.
We both know about war.

01:10:20.765 --> 01:10:24.018
We've both tried to put it behind us.
You and me, we're alike.

01:10:25.561 --> 01:10:29.440
We are nothing alike. You're nothing!
You kill women and children! Names!

01:10:29.523 --> 01:10:31.609
To Almighty God, I don't know!

01:10:31.692 --> 01:10:34.654
Wait! Wait. I've set a trap for them
when they use the next bomb.

01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:37.323
When they claim responsibility
for the next bombing,

01:10:37.406 --> 01:10:40.993
they'll use a code word,
telling the police they're IRA.

01:10:41.994 --> 01:10:43.913
I've changed that code word.

01:10:43.996 --> 01:10:46.874
So, when they use it, I'll know.

01:10:53.923 --> 01:10:55.174
You have one day.

01:10:57.551 --> 01:10:59.231
What if they don't set off a bomb by then?

01:11:00.930 --> 01:11:02.265
Twenty-four hours.

01:11:05.518 --> 01:11:09.397
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Sweet Jesus.

01:11:12.483 --> 01:11:13.963
We missed it the first time...

01:11:14.527 --> 01:11:16.487
But ran a reconfiguration through RAPTOR,

01:11:16.570 --> 01:11:19.532
and the image's anomalies
and architecture became more apparent.

01:11:19.865 --> 01:11:22.702
Now there, look, the back of his hand.

01:11:22.785 --> 01:11:25.246
- Hmm.
- Looks like a burn or a birthmark.

01:11:25.579 --> 01:11:26.872
We're running comparatives now.

01:11:26.956 --> 01:11:29.709
So, it's a bit more time,
but we'll get it.

01:11:34.547 --> 01:11:37.258
Come on. Come on.

01:11:47.018 --> 01:11:47.935
OK.

01:11:48.019 --> 01:11:49.145
There you go.

01:12:54.585 --> 01:12:57.421
- Good morning, Sean. Thanks for coming.
- Are you all right?

01:12:57.505 --> 01:13:00.257
Well, I've been better.
There's been another bombing.

01:13:00.341 --> 01:13:02.676
- Yeah, I just heard.
- Aye, a London bus.

01:13:02.843 --> 01:13:04.929
- Has Bromley phoned?
- No. Not yet.

01:13:05.179 --> 01:13:07.619
McGrath's on his way with some locals.
They'll give ya a hand.

01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:10.684
No, I don't need them. I'll handle it.

01:13:10.768 --> 01:13:11.769
Good man.

01:13:30.079 --> 01:13:30.955
Hennessy.

01:13:31.038 --> 01:13:34.625
They called, but didn't give a code word.
What the hell's going on?

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.544
Maybe it wasn't them.

01:13:36.919 --> 01:13:39.004
Press Association took the call.

01:13:39.088 --> 01:13:41.733
A man with an Irish accent said
there'd be no more fuckin' cooperation

01:13:41.757 --> 01:13:43.277
with the Brits and no more code words.

01:13:43.551 --> 01:13:46.137
He knew exactly which bus
and how much explosive was used.

01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:48.347
And it's been ID'd as your Semtex again.

01:13:48.431 --> 01:13:51.851
Either someone talked,
warned them off, or you're playing me.

01:13:51.934 --> 01:13:56.981
Only two people knew what was happening...
Myself and Morrison.

01:13:57.314 --> 01:13:59.358
Like I said, one of you can't be trusted.

01:13:59.775 --> 01:14:02.445
Send me a number where
I can reach you day or night.

01:14:03.612 --> 01:14:05.906
I'll call the moment I have something.

01:14:06.323 --> 01:14:07.741
It better be soon,

01:14:07.825 --> 01:14:10.586
or you'll feel a backlash the likes
of which you've never felt before.

01:14:15.124 --> 01:14:16.542
A bus now.

01:14:16.625 --> 01:14:19.295
For God's sake,
16 dead, twice that injured.

01:14:19.378 --> 01:14:20.838
I'm sorry.

01:14:21.213 --> 01:14:24.008
I had a plan to nail the bastards.
Didn't work.

01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:27.052
I've just come
from Downing Street.

01:14:27.595 --> 01:14:29.013
The PM will consider the pardons,

01:14:29.096 --> 01:14:31.474
but only if you give up
the bombers immediately.

01:14:31.682 --> 01:14:33.893
And how in God's name do I do that?

01:14:33.976 --> 01:14:35.436
Find a way.

01:14:35.519 --> 01:14:39.190
Plans are afoot to put the paratroops
back on your streets in 48 hours.

01:14:39.482 --> 01:14:41.066
Belfast will erupt.

01:14:41.150 --> 01:14:43.611
You'll give the bombers
exactly what they want.

01:14:43.694 --> 01:14:46.530
Well, it's out of my hands now.
Call when you have something.

01:14:46.906 --> 01:14:48.508
I'm heading for a conference
in Rome tomorrow.

01:14:48.532 --> 01:14:50.284
I'll have my cell at all times.

01:15:09.553 --> 01:15:12.473
How was London? Is Mary OK?

01:15:13.641 --> 01:15:15.893
You said to keep an eye on her,

01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:18.604
and make sure she and Keri were kept safe.

01:15:22.441 --> 01:15:26.278
I spent some time in her hotel lobby
watching the comings and goings, you know?

01:15:26.654 --> 01:15:28.155
She had no idea I was there.

01:15:30.032 --> 01:15:31.450
And your nephew turns up.

01:15:33.369 --> 01:15:34.912
He spent two hours in her room.

01:15:37.164 --> 01:15:40.417
- He spent two hours in Mary's room?
- Aye.

01:15:40.918 --> 01:15:41.919
And after he goes,

01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:44.880
Mary comes down,

01:15:45.756 --> 01:15:47.967
and calls Hugh McGrath on the lobby phone.

01:16:10.573 --> 01:16:11.740
It's done.

01:16:18.289 --> 01:16:21.875
Unless they take it apart,
there's no way to know it's been modified.

01:16:22.001 --> 01:16:24.211
Fuckin' brilliant. What'll set it off?

01:16:24.295 --> 01:16:25.504
The internal clock.

01:16:25.588 --> 01:16:27.339
I'll input the time
once we know the flight.

01:16:27.423 --> 01:16:29.883
There's a security conference
in Rome tomorrow.

01:16:29.967 --> 01:16:33.554
All the top MPs and security people are
flying there on three lunchtime flights.

01:16:33.637 --> 01:16:35.681
Perfect. What about our mule?

01:16:36.432 --> 01:16:37.891
Sara just confirmed he's going.

01:16:38.934 --> 01:16:41.228
We then ran the burn-mark
through the database.

01:16:41.312 --> 01:16:43.272
We got a positive hit
on a Patrick O'Reilly,

01:16:43.355 --> 01:16:45.065
age 29, from Belfast.

01:16:45.649 --> 01:16:49.111
O'Reilly had one prior for a domestic
abuse incident three years back.

01:16:49.194 --> 01:16:50.738
Did two months in Hydebank.

01:16:51.363 --> 01:16:54.533
We entered O'Reilly
into the facial rec bank for matches.

01:16:54.617 --> 01:16:55.909
We got a hit.

01:16:58.245 --> 01:17:01.540
That's him in a Dublin pub
with an IRA member four weeks ago.

01:17:01.957 --> 01:17:04.793
It's a known IRA meeting place
we've had under surveillance for years.

01:17:08.756 --> 01:17:10.108
And the other two with him?

01:17:10.132 --> 01:17:11.972
I was about to get to them,
Minister.

01:17:12.051 --> 01:17:14.678
That and a woman we've just ID'd
at the bus explosion.

01:17:21.727 --> 01:17:22.727
Yes.

01:17:23.145 --> 01:17:24.938
Your mole's Hugh McGrath.

01:17:27.024 --> 01:17:28.317
Did you hear me, Hennessy?

01:17:29.234 --> 01:17:30.778
Are you sure now?

01:17:30.944 --> 01:17:31.945
Quite.

01:17:32.988 --> 01:17:36.408
We've ID'd the Knightsbridge bomber
as Patrick O'Reilly of Belfast.

01:17:36.492 --> 01:17:40.245
Three weeks ago, Mr. O'Reilly was observed
meeting Hugh McGrath in a Dublin pub.

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:42.915
Where's McGrath and O'Reilly now?

01:17:44.333 --> 01:17:45.918
I don't know O'Reilly.

01:17:47.002 --> 01:17:48.587
I haven't seen McGrath.

01:17:48.671 --> 01:17:50.381
Let me help you with McGrath.

01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:55.052
His phone's GPS puts him
52 meters south of you.

01:17:55.135 --> 01:17:57.429
I'm watching him coming up your drive.

01:17:58.347 --> 01:17:59.765
So, let's cut the shit.

01:18:00.641 --> 01:18:03.519
There's a Chinook airborne
right now with a 12-man team.

01:18:03.602 --> 01:18:07.189
They'll land on your farm in 30 minutes
to take McGrath into custody.

01:18:07.272 --> 01:18:10.275
I needn't tell you how that'll go,
nor how your cozy relationship with him

01:18:10.359 --> 01:18:11.902
will sink your career...

01:18:12.152 --> 01:18:13.404
This time for good.

01:18:15.406 --> 01:18:16.407
Or?

01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:18.742
Question McGrath your way
and get what I need.

01:18:19.201 --> 01:18:20.661
Names and locations of everyone.

01:18:20.994 --> 01:18:23.455
You can't save him,
but maybe you can save yourself.

01:18:23.539 --> 01:18:26.667
Thirty minutes, get what I need,
I'll turn them around.

01:18:28.794 --> 01:18:29.794
Jim.

01:18:34.967 --> 01:18:39.304
Send McGrath's men to the trailhead,
see if Sean needs any help.

01:18:48.313 --> 01:18:49.690
Give me your phone.

01:18:49.773 --> 01:18:51.501
- What the hell?
- Give me your phone.

01:18:53.318 --> 01:18:56.113
Get your ass in that chair there,
you motherfucker.

01:18:58.031 --> 01:19:00.075
- A London bus, for Christ sake!
- Now hold on.

01:19:00.159 --> 01:19:01.452
Not even fuckin' warnings!

01:19:02.035 --> 01:19:03.579
Sixteen dead.

01:19:03.662 --> 01:19:06.373
You stabbed me in the back
and sanctioned this bloodbath

01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:07.916
to get your war back on.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.669
The plan had no balls.

01:19:10.753 --> 01:19:12.838
This wasn't a Bombing Light campaign.

01:19:12.921 --> 01:19:14.882
You said hurt 'em, and hurt 'em we did.

01:19:14.965 --> 01:19:16.675
By killing women and children?

01:19:17.426 --> 01:19:19.511
You can't restrain yourself.

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:21.346
You never could. Well, it's over.

01:19:22.848 --> 01:19:25.350
Their names, aliases, and location.

01:19:25.434 --> 01:19:28.937
You know I can't do that.

01:19:29.104 --> 01:19:30.856
That's me being nice.

01:19:30.939 --> 01:19:33.484
Now write. And it better match
what I already know.

01:19:33.567 --> 01:19:37.237
By God, I'll take you apart
joint by joint!

01:19:37.946 --> 01:19:39.448
You used me.

01:19:39.698 --> 01:19:43.202
You wanted the pardons
for your own political gain.

01:19:43.285 --> 01:19:45.329
You're a disgrace to the cause.

01:19:48.081 --> 01:19:49.374
Four men and a woman.

01:19:53.962 --> 01:19:55.297
Maggie Dunn?

01:19:55.506 --> 01:19:58.467
Aye. You call her that.

01:19:59.343 --> 01:20:01.595
Sara Mackay's her real name.

01:20:04.431 --> 01:20:05.849
She works for you?

01:20:06.725 --> 01:20:08.268
Bloody right.

01:20:08.352 --> 01:20:09.686
Checks and balances.

01:20:13.315 --> 01:20:18.487
An insurance policy,
in case you lose your nerve,

01:20:18.570 --> 01:20:22.407
which you have.
So now, if they take the lads,

01:20:23.325 --> 01:20:26.453
she will lead them straight back to you.

01:20:27.079 --> 01:20:29.248
Not so easy anymore now, is it?

01:20:29.665 --> 01:20:32.960
SO15 will be here
in 20 minutes to take you in.

01:20:33.919 --> 01:20:35.838
We both know that can't happen.

01:20:36.713 --> 01:20:41.260
You gave me up to the Brits?

01:20:41.593 --> 01:20:45.013
You tout bastard!

01:20:45.097 --> 01:20:46.682
You gave yourself up.

01:20:47.474 --> 01:20:51.186
They've got surveillance of you
in an IRA pub with a Pat O'Reilly,

01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:53.313
who they ID'd as the Knightsbridge bomber.

01:20:53.564 --> 01:20:56.316
And thanks to your GPS phone,
they tracked you here.

01:21:00.696 --> 01:21:02.489
You broke every rule, Hughie.

01:21:04.324 --> 01:21:08.370
And now I'm left to clean up your mess
as I have for the past 30 years.

01:21:13.584 --> 01:21:14.626
A final thing.

01:21:17.004 --> 01:21:18.004
My wife?

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:20.841
What about her?

01:21:27.014 --> 01:21:31.643
She hates you because of her brother.

01:21:32.519 --> 01:21:34.146
And so she reached out to me.

01:21:34.354 --> 01:21:38.025
So, yes, I helped her...

01:21:38.859 --> 01:21:40.027
And she helped me.

01:21:58.503 --> 01:22:00.589
- Yes.
- Bromley.

01:22:01.673 --> 01:22:03.008
I got your names.

01:22:12.893 --> 01:22:14.978
Oh, shit, I'm late. I've got to go.

01:22:17.230 --> 01:22:18.273
Did you cum?

01:22:18.398 --> 01:22:21.652
No.
I'm not a three-second wonder like you.

01:23:06.863 --> 01:23:09.992
Well, keep wearing that shirt,
I'll be a two-second wonder.

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:11.910
You're gonna have to get used to it.

01:23:15.497 --> 01:23:17.499
Practice, practice, practice.

01:23:27.926 --> 01:23:28.927
I'm close.

01:23:29.094 --> 01:23:33.181
McGrath confessed.
It was his op all along.

01:23:33.306 --> 01:23:38.020
I've got the bombers' names and location.
I'll text you the info. You may need it.

01:23:38.103 --> 01:23:41.356
The one that killed Quan's daughter
is Pat O'Reilly.

01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:43.483
He's got a burn-mark on his right hand.

01:23:43.567 --> 01:23:48.613
Either way, Sean, you end this, now.

01:23:49.072 --> 01:23:51.241
- You hear me?
- Understood.

01:25:25.377 --> 01:25:27.129
You know why you're still alive?

01:25:27.379 --> 01:25:30.298
You want the names?

01:25:31.341 --> 01:25:36.054
They're in the phone.
The last text, code 7741.

01:25:38.181 --> 01:25:40.183
Five names and their location in London.

01:25:41.309 --> 01:25:43.603
O'Reilly set the bomb
that killed your daughter.

01:25:45.063 --> 01:25:47.190
He's got a burn-mark on his right hand.

01:25:48.483 --> 01:25:50.235
You fought in the army.

01:25:50.610 --> 01:25:53.780
Iraq. Royal Irish Regiment.

01:25:55.031 --> 01:25:56.241
Two tours, Special Forces.

01:25:59.744 --> 01:26:03.123
You're Catholic,
but you fought for British. Why?

01:26:03.206 --> 01:26:04.749
I fought for the regiment.

01:26:06.334 --> 01:26:09.629
Out there, religion didn't matter.
We were all the same. That's it.

01:26:11.798 --> 01:26:12.966
Family?

01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:14.634
A brother.

01:26:16.428 --> 01:26:17.846
The rest have passed away.

01:26:58.470 --> 01:27:00.847
Come in.

01:27:04.976 --> 01:27:06.311
Take a seat, Sean.

01:27:10.273 --> 01:27:13.610
Aye. You look like
you've been through the wars.

01:27:13.902 --> 01:27:17.239
Aye. Quan got the drop on me.

01:27:18.531 --> 01:27:21.201
I gave him the names,
he took my things and let me go.

01:27:21.993 --> 01:27:23.995
When the bombers called in about the bus,

01:27:25.163 --> 01:27:27.290
they didn't use a code word,

01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:29.292
because someone tipped them off.

01:27:30.543 --> 01:27:34.130
Only two people knew
the reason for the code change.

01:27:34.881 --> 01:27:37.259
You and me.

01:27:37.342 --> 01:27:40.595
Liam, I didn't tell anyone. I swear.
I spoke to Bromley, and that was it.

01:27:41.096 --> 01:27:44.599
What if I told you I had Murphy stay

01:27:44.683 --> 01:27:46.685
and watch Mary in London?

01:27:50.730 --> 01:27:52.816
My own flesh and blood.

01:27:53.275 --> 01:27:54.192
Liam, I'm so sorry.

01:27:54.276 --> 01:27:56.528
I don't wanna know
what happened in that room.

01:27:58.405 --> 01:28:02.075
All I wanna know is, what was discussed

01:28:02.158 --> 01:28:05.745
when your sweet Aunt Mary was with you?

01:28:05.829 --> 01:28:08.206
Did she say she was involved
with McGrath and the bombers?

01:28:08.290 --> 01:28:09.332
No. Never.

01:28:10.375 --> 01:28:12.395
She was upset about her brother
and kept on about that.

01:28:12.419 --> 01:28:14.897
When you and I were talking
about the code word, she asked about 'em,

01:28:14.921 --> 01:28:16.232
but she never let on about McGrath.

01:28:16.256 --> 01:28:18.425
Oh, so, she could hear us on the phone?

01:28:18.508 --> 01:28:20.844
No, it was only after our call
she mentioned the code word.

01:28:20.927 --> 01:28:23.847
- She thought they wouldn't be of use.
- So, she steered the conversation?

01:28:24.139 --> 01:28:25.640
Well, yes, I guess she did.

01:28:25.724 --> 01:28:28.810
Ah. A good manipulator, she is.

01:28:28.893 --> 01:28:30.061
So, she told the bombers?

01:28:30.145 --> 01:28:33.106
She told McGrath, McGrath told them.

01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:34.691
Thick as thieves, they were.

01:28:35.442 --> 01:28:38.194
She tricked the information
out of ya, Sean.

01:28:39.571 --> 01:28:41.323
She used you.

01:28:42.115 --> 01:28:43.408
- Liam, I...
- Shut up!

01:28:55.962 --> 01:28:57.839
Bury that pig in the sow-pen.

01:28:59.299 --> 01:29:01.926
And after that,
I have one final task for you.

01:29:03.261 --> 01:29:04.679
And when that's done...

01:29:07.307 --> 01:29:09.059
go back to New York, son.

01:29:37.962 --> 01:29:39.005
Thank you.

01:29:48.556 --> 01:29:51.851
Zero, this is Alpha Two.
Echo One toward target house.

01:29:52.477 --> 01:29:54.979
Zero. Echo One's
toward the target house. Copy.

01:29:55.688 --> 01:29:58.650
Echo One has entered
the target house and unsighted to me.

01:29:59.317 --> 01:30:02.278
Zero. Echo One is in target house
and unsighted to you. Copy.

01:30:02.362 --> 01:30:03.655
Thank Christ for that.

01:30:05.073 --> 01:30:08.243
Sierra call signs. Confirm when Echo One
is complete in target house.

01:30:08.326 --> 01:30:09.911
Sierra Two, roger that.

01:30:11.538 --> 01:30:13.081
Sierra Three, roger that.

01:30:19.921 --> 01:30:21.214
X-Ray One on balcony.

01:30:25.176 --> 01:30:26.856
Echo One approaching front door.

01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:42.944
How'd it go?

01:30:43.945 --> 01:30:44.946
It's done.

01:30:52.579 --> 01:30:55.139
I have visual. X-Ray One
and Echo One have left the room.

01:30:55.165 --> 01:30:56.624
All other X-Rays remain.

01:31:07.802 --> 01:31:08.970
Zero, this is Alpha Two.

01:31:09.053 --> 01:31:11.598
One unknown Echo and two children
entering the target house.

01:31:11.764 --> 01:31:12.764
Roger that.

01:31:34.913 --> 01:31:36.164
He's a slobbering oaf.

01:31:36.539 --> 01:31:37.539
It had to be done.

01:31:38.541 --> 01:31:40.793
I had to shag him.
It was fuckin' disgusting.

01:31:41.419 --> 01:31:43.463
Look, I know what you
went through. All right?

01:31:43.546 --> 01:31:45.173
Do ya, Denis? Do ya really?

01:31:45.882 --> 01:31:48.194
Well, maybe for the next bomb,
you can set up a gay Magistrate.

01:31:48.218 --> 01:31:49.469
How would that be?

01:31:50.053 --> 01:31:51.429
Taking a shower.

01:31:53.890 --> 01:31:54.890
Next.

01:32:14.202 --> 01:32:15.762
X-Ray One entering living room.

01:32:17.497 --> 01:32:19.832
All X-Rays now complete in living room.

01:32:20.625 --> 01:32:22.627
All call signs
move to your final rendezvous.

01:33:02.417 --> 01:33:04.669
X-Rays and Echo complete in living room.

01:33:14.679 --> 01:33:17.307
We've lost visual.
Echo One has closed the blinds.

01:33:18.016 --> 01:33:19.892
Fox One, you have control.

01:33:19.976 --> 01:33:21.978
Roger that. I have control.

01:33:22.061 --> 01:33:23.604
Standby. Standby.

01:33:27.859 --> 01:33:29.235
Stop, stop, stop!

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:30.403
Wait!

01:33:37.493 --> 01:33:39.871
Sierra call signs, report what's going on.

01:33:39.954 --> 01:33:42.123
I've two unknowns
at the front door. Wait.

01:33:42.206 --> 01:33:44.834
Sorry for the bother,
but there's a gas leak in the building,

01:33:44.917 --> 01:33:47.962
and the gas man
needs entry for an inspection.

01:33:48.087 --> 01:33:51.090
Our gas works fine. There's no problem.

01:33:51.924 --> 01:33:53.968
He needs to inspect
all the flats, regardless.

01:33:54.052 --> 01:33:56.721
He won't take a moment,
and it is an emergency.

01:34:01.225 --> 01:34:03.853
It's quite important, Mr. Upton.

01:34:03.936 --> 01:34:06.564
By law, I'm allowed to use my own key.

01:34:06.647 --> 01:34:09.984
All right. Just a second.

01:34:22.997 --> 01:34:25.309
Come down when you're done,
and I'll take you to the next flat.

01:34:25.333 --> 01:34:27.001
Thank you. I will be very fast.

01:34:32.757 --> 01:34:33.841
This way.

01:34:56.989 --> 01:34:58.366
Can I see the boiler, please?

01:34:58.449 --> 01:35:00.576
Would you mind
putting your bag on the table?

01:35:07.625 --> 01:35:08.709
Open it up.

01:35:20.054 --> 01:35:21.054
All right.

01:35:41.868 --> 01:35:43.911
All call signs, standby, standby.

01:37:26.722 --> 01:37:27.765
All call signs, go!

01:37:38.943 --> 01:37:40.695
Get down! Get down!

01:37:40.778 --> 01:37:43.447
Get down! Get down! Get down!

01:37:45.741 --> 01:37:46.867
Room clear!

01:37:51.789 --> 01:37:52.789
X-Rays down.

01:37:52.832 --> 01:37:54.417
What about Echo?

01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:56.043
She's alive, under control.

01:37:57.503 --> 01:37:58.588
Who planned this?

01:37:59.297 --> 01:38:00.381
Go fuck yourself.

01:38:07.221 --> 01:38:08.848
What's this, eh? Your next bomb?

01:38:09.015 --> 01:38:10.141
Go fuck yourself.

01:38:15.187 --> 01:38:16.772
Talk, you rotten slag!

01:38:25.281 --> 01:38:26.741
It's too late.

01:38:28.409 --> 01:38:30.953
Nine minutes it blows. No time to land.

01:38:31.037 --> 01:38:35.249
What's that? A plane? Which plane?

01:38:35.333 --> 01:38:36.542
Which plane?

01:38:37.168 --> 01:38:38.586
Open her shirt.

01:38:46.344 --> 01:38:47.511
This is how it works.

01:38:48.929 --> 01:38:52.224
I ask questions. You answer.

01:38:52.892 --> 01:38:57.897
That's right. Flight 136 to Rome.
Passenger name Ian Wood.

01:38:57.980 --> 01:38:58.980
Bomb's in his laptop.

01:38:59.273 --> 01:39:01.400
Set to go off at 3:00 p.m. exactly.

01:39:01.484 --> 01:39:04.111
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be advised.

01:39:04.195 --> 01:39:07.615
Flight 136 to Rome
has been further delayed.

01:39:07.698 --> 01:39:09.742
We apologize for the inconvenience.

01:39:09.825 --> 01:39:12.161
Again, Flight 136 to Rome...

01:39:12.244 --> 01:39:15.164
Ian Wood!
Is there an Ian Wood here?

01:39:15.247 --> 01:39:17.541
Ian Wood! Ian Wood?

01:39:17.625 --> 01:39:20.336
Is there an Ian Wood here? Ian Wood?

01:39:21.087 --> 01:39:25.257
Ian Wood? Ian Wood? Ian Wood?

01:39:26.676 --> 01:39:28.594
What's going on? What's going on?

01:39:28.678 --> 01:39:30.930
They're looking for someone
named Ian Wood.

01:39:31.013 --> 01:39:33.140
That's me. I'm Ian Wood.

01:39:33.224 --> 01:39:35.017
Ian Wood!

01:39:35.101 --> 01:39:36.143
I'm Ian Wood.

01:39:37.561 --> 01:39:39.121
- Is that your laptop?
- Yeah.

01:39:41.148 --> 01:39:43.109
Move! Move! Move!

01:39:43.192 --> 01:39:45.986
Get down! Get down! Get down! Get down!

01:39:46.445 --> 01:39:48.322
Get down! Get down!

01:39:48.823 --> 01:39:50.533
Get down! Get down!

01:39:50.616 --> 01:39:52.159
Move! Move!

01:39:52.243 --> 01:39:53.786
Get down! Get down! Move!

01:39:53.869 --> 01:39:58.374
Get outta the way! Get out!
Move here! Get out!

01:39:59.917 --> 01:40:00.918
Move!

01:40:21.814 --> 01:40:25.568
She said a gas man turned up
with an assault gun, a Chinaman.

01:40:25.651 --> 01:40:28.946
Started shooting, killed everyone but her,
and then walked out the door.

01:40:29.029 --> 01:40:30.489
She said he was a Chinaman?

01:40:30.573 --> 01:40:32.533
Affirmative. About 60 years old.

01:40:32.616 --> 01:40:34.428
Just got word
the device is neutralized.

01:40:34.452 --> 01:40:37.621
Good work. Fox Hunt is now terminated.

01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:39.415
No loose ends.

01:40:39.498 --> 01:40:40.958
Understood.

01:40:51.719 --> 01:40:55.139
It's Bromley. I need an AP
out to all city-district units

01:40:55.222 --> 01:40:57.725
from Wapping High Street to the A1203.

01:40:58.893 --> 01:41:03.856
Suspect's an Asian male, 61 years of age,
five feet, eight inches, 11 stone.

01:41:04.523 --> 01:41:06.400
His name's Ngoc Minh Quan.

01:41:06.525 --> 01:41:09.612
He's armed
and has U.S. Special Forces training.

01:41:09.695 --> 01:41:11.447
Use extreme caution.

01:41:40.351 --> 01:41:41.351
Yes.

01:41:41.435 --> 01:41:44.313
I was on the flight
they targeted to blow up.

01:41:44.396 --> 01:41:46.249
Because of your timely information,
we stopped it.

01:41:46.273 --> 01:41:47.942
I wanted to thank you personally.

01:41:49.527 --> 01:41:51.111
Thank God you're OK.

01:41:51.570 --> 01:41:54.657
The bombers were neutralized,
even Sara McKay,

01:41:55.074 --> 01:41:57.409
whom you called "Maggie."

01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:03.332
She gave a reporter the bomb
that was to have been put on my flight.

01:42:03.624 --> 01:42:05.793
She also carried out the bus carnage,

01:42:05.918 --> 01:42:10.548
and is directly connected to you,
and McGrath.

01:42:11.090 --> 01:42:13.843
We have call-pens going
to and from her off the cell tower

01:42:13.926 --> 01:42:15.511
by your farm and town homes.

01:42:15.594 --> 01:42:18.138
That's 250 precision locations
and activations

01:42:18.222 --> 01:42:20.808
- consistent with your mutual activities.
- Katherine...

01:42:20.891 --> 01:42:24.103
I've spoken to the PM.
He's agreed to keep you in office for now.

01:42:24.186 --> 01:42:27.022
I'm issuing pardons
for five On-the-Runs, one is your cousin.

01:42:27.106 --> 01:42:30.734
But, make no mistake,
Deputy First Minister, you are ours now.

01:42:32.027 --> 01:42:33.779
I say jump, you say where.

01:42:34.655 --> 01:42:36.407
You're on the next flight back to London.

01:42:36.490 --> 01:42:39.535
Tomorrow you'll brief
SO15 and myself on everything you know.

01:42:40.744 --> 01:42:42.329
All of it.

01:43:36.175 --> 01:43:37.217
Good evening, sir.

01:44:16.131 --> 01:44:17.174
How did you find me?

01:44:18.926 --> 01:44:20.678
I gave you the names, like I said.

01:44:24.807 --> 01:44:29.311
This woman, she's a bomber.
You lie. You plan everything.

01:44:30.813 --> 01:44:32.231
For whatever it's worth...

01:44:33.857 --> 01:44:36.318
I never intended to hurt your daughter

01:44:37.319 --> 01:44:38.946
or any of those people.

01:44:41.907 --> 01:44:43.075
Send.

01:44:45.285 --> 01:44:46.286
Do it!

01:45:02.261 --> 01:45:05.097
It's now on the Internet,
you and your mistress.

01:45:05.848 --> 01:45:08.225
The whole world will know
you are a terrorist.

01:45:10.894 --> 01:45:12.563
Good-bye, Mr. Hennessy.

01:46:02.696 --> 01:46:03.739
Yes?

01:46:03.822 --> 01:46:06.533
It's Landesman, sir, in S-11.
I've got him.

01:46:06.617 --> 01:46:07.618
Where?

01:46:07.701 --> 01:46:10.746
The Happy Peacock Takeaway.
He's returned.

01:46:10.829 --> 01:46:12.498
Do I send in a team?

01:46:13.916 --> 01:46:15.042
No.

01:46:16.418 --> 01:46:18.420
I believe we owe this chap something.

01:46:18.921 --> 01:46:22.508
Keep back for now.
Observe and report only.

01:46:22.591 --> 01:46:23.592
Yes, sir.
