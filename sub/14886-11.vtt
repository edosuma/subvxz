apologize for my husband.

Balki, it only gets better.
You haven't seen anything yet.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.604
Wait till we get to Madison.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.405
My mom will open the front door

03:25.438 --> 03:26.740
and there'll
be the smell of hot‐‐

03:26.773 --> 03:28.374
Hot apple cider on the stove

03:28.408 --> 03:30.877
and date‐nut bread
baking in the oven.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.412
Right, there'll be a roaring‐‐

03:32.445 --> 03:33.847

03:33.880 --> 03:35.682
and the whole family

this is gonna be

is good, wait till

04:29.002 --> 04:31.838

the snow is better in Madison.

You're gonna love
Christmas morning.

My mom always tries to trick us
by setting the clocks back

04:41.014 --> 04:43.584
but you can't fool nine kids.

Oh.

04:45.018 --> 04:47.688
And you know what this year is?

04:49.656 --> 04:50.891
1986?

04:52.959 --> 04:55.328
Well, yes, it is.

Aah, aah, oh.

What I meant was, this year,
I'm the Christmas boy.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.873
Well, of course you are.
Don't be ridiculous.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.876
What is that?

05:09.910 --> 05:12.546
It's my turn
to hand out the presents.

05:12.579 --> 05:14.715
I've waited nine years
for it to be my turn again.

05:16.449 --> 05:18.652
Boy, I love Christmas
with my family.

05:20.053 --> 05:22.422
This is the, the first, uh

05:22.455 --> 05:24.891
Christmas I'm going
to be away from my family.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.493
And, uh, I'm going to miss

05:27.528 --> 05:29.796
my little nieces
and nephews laughing

05:29.830 --> 05:32.566
and the smell of baklava
in the kitchen

05:34.134 --> 05:37.604
and the joy of decorating
the Christmas turtle.

05:37.638 --> 05:41.942
Well, of course you're
gonna miss all that.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.409
Anyone would.

05:45.111 --> 05:47.514
Did you say Christmas turtle?

05:49.049 --> 05:50.684
Well, of course.

05:50.717 --> 05:52.686
On Mypos, at Christmas

05:52.719 --> 05:54.888
the whole family
goes down to the seashore

05:54.921 --> 05:58.625
and we catch a big sea turtle,
we bring it home

05:58.659 --> 06:01.427
and we decorate
with, uh, glass balls

06:01.461 --> 06:04.731
and, uh, angels
and little strips of tinfoil

06:04.765 --> 06:05.999
but you wouldn't know
about those things.

06:06.032 --> 06:06.967
Anyway..

06:08.702 --> 06:11.071
...the day after Christmas,
we take him back

06:11.104 --> 06:13.740
and put him in the ocean
and he swim away.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.776
But the same turtle keeps

06:15.809 --> 06:18.712
coming back
to us every Christmas.

06:18.745 --> 06:21.948
And...I'm gonna miss Bernie.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.483
[crying]

06:28.088 --> 06:29.155
You know what
I can't understand?

06:29.189 --> 06:32.626
Why do American decorate trees
instead of turtles?

06:34.160 --> 06:36.697
Well, one good reason is a tree

06:36.730 --> 06:39.099
won't slowly crawl
out of the living room.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.103
That's what
the Christmas lettuce is for.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.745
I'm gonna miss those things.

06:51.778 --> 06:53.514
Well, hey, buddy, I know

06:53.547 --> 06:55.649
Christmas isn't gonna be
the same for you

06:55.682 --> 06:58.451
but it could be just as good.

06:58.484 --> 07:00.721
Sometimes, you have to adjust

07:00.754 --> 07:04.024
to the changes
in your life and move on.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.796
Thank you for inviting me
to share your Christmas.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.665
Well, I wouldn't have
it any other way.

just thought we'd say goodbye.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.908
‐ Well, have a wonderful trip.
‐ Oh, we will.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.645
With the storm coming in,
the skiing's gonna be terrific.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.513
Yeah, I always heard
it was better with snow.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.817
Have a merry Christmas.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.187
Mistletoe.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.056
It's an old tradition.

08:43.089 --> 08:45.826
You hang it over the door
and women have to kiss you.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.031
What a gimmick.

08:54.968 --> 08:58.038
Why don't we hang
it up all year long?

08:58.071 --> 09:00.807
Unfortunately, it
only works at Christmas.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.009
‐ Then I'm takin' it with us.
‐ Huh.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.714
Well, you all packed?

09:07.748 --> 09:09.783
‐ Let's go to Madison.
‐ Right.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.217
Let me call first.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.887
No point in sitting at the
airport if our plane is late.

you talking about?

Uh, eh, mom, please,
whatever you do

10:15.448 --> 10:18.785

be the Christmas boy.

of ways to get there

10:59.092 --> 11:00.193

11:00.226 --> 11:02.929
Balki, we're going to get there.

to hand out the presents

and it won't be my
turn again until 1995.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.329
There's got to be
a way to get there.

just take your car.

12:30.316 --> 12:33.019
Why am I doing all the pushing?

12:33.053 --> 12:35.956
Because I'm the better driver.

12:35.989 --> 12:38.191
Is that why
we're on the sidewalk?

12:38.224 --> 12:41.528
This car isn't going anywhere
till spring. Let's go home.

12:41.562 --> 12:45.165
I can't believe this
is happening to me.

12:45.198 --> 12:48.802
They call these snow tires.

12:48.835 --> 12:53.006
‐ Look, a Christmas tree store.
‐ What good is that gonna do us?

12:53.039 --> 12:55.008
We'll be.. We're not going
to get to Madison.

12:55.041 --> 12:57.443
So we're going to have our
Christmas right here in Chicago.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.780
‐ I don't see how.
‐ Just watch.

13:09.856 --> 13:11.391
Yeah?

13:11.424 --> 13:12.626
We want a tree.

13:12.659 --> 13:16.029
What, are you kidding? I sold
the last one four hours ago.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.164
I'm havin' dinner.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.534
Come on, Balki,
the man's eating.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.235
Please, I want a tree.

13:22.268 --> 13:27.007
(female #1)
'Marvin, in or out,
just close the door.'

13:27.040 --> 13:29.442
I knew we should never
have moved in with her mother.

13:31.111 --> 13:34.280
Look, guys, I'd like to help
you, but I got nothin' here.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.249
What about that tree?

13:43.924 --> 13:46.326
Balki, when they
chopped that tree down

13:46.359 --> 13:49.930
it was a mercy killing.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.198
I think it will perk up
once we put it in water.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.568
Oh, right, let's buy it
and throw it in Lake Michigan.

13:56.570 --> 13:59.072
You're in a bad mood,
aren't you?

13:59.105 --> 14:00.641
He's leaning in that direction.

14:00.674 --> 14:04.444
Look, you guys want this tree?
You got it, it's yours.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.046
I'm freezin' to death out here.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.147
Thank you.

14:08.982 --> 14:12.619
Balki, this will
never be a Christmas tree.

14:12.653 --> 14:14.888
Cousin, it's not perfect,
but, but it'll be pretty

14:14.921 --> 14:16.389
when it's decorated.

14:16.422 --> 14:19.660
No matter what we do,
it's not gonna be Christmas.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.095
It's just not there.

14:22.128 --> 14:23.964
What's not there?

14:23.997 --> 14:25.666
The Christmas feeling.

14:25.699 --> 14:28.168
Cousin, you're going to
get the Christmas feeling

14:28.201 --> 14:30.103
when we take this home
and decorate it

14:30.136 --> 14:31.672
it'll be beautiful, you'll see.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.540
Fine, you do that.

14:33.574 --> 14:35.475
Have yourself
a merry little Christmas.

14:35.509 --> 14:37.644
I'm goin' for a walk.

14:37.678 --> 14:40.146
‐ I'm going with you.
‐ No.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.482
I wanna be alone.

14:43.984 --> 14:46.486

15:33.066 --> 15:34.968
Ho, ho, ho!

15:42.208 --> 15:45.278
I'm Balki Claus.
Merry Christmas!

15:48.248 --> 15:50.083
It was the night
before Christmas

15:50.116 --> 15:52.185
and all through the house..

15:57.123 --> 15:58.158
[exhales]

16:00.126 --> 16:02.195
...not a creature was stirring.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.632
Not even a mouse.

16:05.666 --> 16:09.269
When, what to my
wondering eyes should appear

16:10.671 --> 16:14.240
but a little tiny sleigh
and eight tiny reindeer.

16:15.075 --> 16:18.244
On Dancer, on Prancer

16:18.278 --> 16:20.480
and on Donna Dixon.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.787
On Comet, on Cupid

16:26.820 --> 16:29.322
on Reagan, on Nixon.

16:36.630 --> 16:40.300
Feel free to jump in any time.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.202
Where did you
get that Santa suit?

16:42.235 --> 16:44.705
The same place I got
all these great decorations.

16:44.738 --> 16:48.074
Downstairs in our
very own Ritz Discount Store.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.677
Look. What do you think?

16:50.711 --> 16:53.279
Think the proper thing
to do is to cover

16:53.313 --> 16:54.681
the tree with a sheet.

16:54.715 --> 16:57.183
Let it rest in peace.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.451
Of course, it's
no Christmas turtle

16:58.484 --> 16:59.653
but wait till
I turn on the lights.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.689
Cover your eyes.

17:02.723 --> 17:04.190
Cover.

17:04.223 --> 17:05.358
Cover.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.531
Okay, okay.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.640
The, the lights don't work.

17:19.673 --> 17:22.509
‐ They always work in Madison.
‐ Okay, wait, wait.

17:22.542 --> 17:23.510
I.. There's more.

17:23.544 --> 17:25.078
I finally found a food store

17:25.111 --> 17:25.811
that's open on Christmas Eve.

17:25.846 --> 17:27.313
We're going to have

17:27.347 --> 17:29.816
a big Christmas dinner
after all.

17:29.850 --> 17:32.485
We got potato knishes,
gefilte fish

17:32.519 --> 17:34.588
matzo ball soup and brisket.

17:40.426 --> 17:41.828
‐ I'm not hungry.
‐ Okay.

17:41.862 --> 17:43.496
We sing Christmas carols.

17:43.530 --> 17:47.300
‐ I don't feel like singing.
‐ Okay, we'll string popcorns.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.570
We'll do any of
the things you do in Madison.

17:49.603 --> 17:51.605
Balki, you wanna do something
to help me celebrate Christmas?

17:51.638 --> 17:53.106
More than anything in the world.

17:53.139 --> 17:55.075
Then leave me alone.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.382
Okay.

18:02.415 --> 18:05.185
Now you're making Balki mad.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.258
I'm busting my buttocks trying
to make a nice Christmas

18:12.292 --> 18:14.460
for you

18:14.494 --> 18:17.130
and all I get
is "Bah, hambugger."

18:24.905 --> 18:27.440
You're acting just
like Ebenezer Stooge.

18:29.810 --> 18:31.377
I'm sorry you can't
have Christmas

18:31.411 --> 18:32.513
at home with your family.

18:32.546 --> 18:33.647
What about me?

18:33.680 --> 18:37.383
You think I don't miss Christmas
on Mypos with my family?

18:37.417 --> 18:39.485
'Passing the Christmas Bota bag'

18:39.520 --> 18:41.722
roasting radishes
over an open fire.

18:43.824 --> 18:45.458
Roasting radishes?

18:47.794 --> 18:49.730
You're the one that
told me that, that I have

18:49.763 --> 18:52.533
to adjust to changes
in my life and move on.

18:52.566 --> 18:54.701
You give
real good advice, but when

18:54.735 --> 18:57.437
the table's upside down,
you act like a big baby.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.875
Maybe it's time you grow up.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.443
I don't wanna.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.549
Well, you're gonna have‐ta.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.387
Just because
this Christmas is‐is different

19:14.420 --> 19:16.523
doesn't mean it can't be good.

19:16.557 --> 19:18.258
And that's another
thing you told me.

19:18.291 --> 19:21.461
Why am I telling this to you?

19:21.494 --> 19:23.864
Balki, I‐I know what you're
saying and I know it's true

19:23.897 --> 19:26.533
but it's just not
that easy to let it go.

19:26.567 --> 19:30.203
Maybe you can and‐and I admire
you for that, but I can't.

19:31.572 --> 19:35.542
It just doesn't
feel like Christmas.

19:35.576 --> 19:39.513
Okay, maybe the feeling
will come if we open presents.

19:39.546 --> 19:43.283
No, no, no. We always open the
presents on Christmas morning.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.484
Look.

19:47.888 --> 19:52.492
I'm Santa Claus and I
say we open the presents now.

19:55.696 --> 19:56.296
Okay.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.534
You can be the Christmas boy.

20:16.950 --> 20:18.451
‐ That's yours.
‐ Hm.

20:25.526 --> 20:27.227
Hmm‐mm.

20:28.729 --> 20:30.330
‐ You go first.
‐ Okay.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.298
I was hoping you'd say that.

20:37.871 --> 20:40.006
Oh!

20:40.040 --> 20:42.242
A home entertainment center.

20:47.814 --> 20:50.817
And a Wayne Newton tape.

20:52.553 --> 20:54.621
You read my letter to Santa.

20:54.655 --> 20:56.590
Well, yeah, I did.

20:57.758 --> 20:59.560
Thank you.

20:59.593 --> 21:00.761
You're welcome.

21:00.794 --> 21:01.528
Your.

21:19.412 --> 21:22.816
Balki, this is beautiful.

21:22.849 --> 21:24.818
I make it myself.

21:25.819 --> 21:27.754
You made this?

21:27.788 --> 21:30.490
I started it the night
I come here to America

21:30.524 --> 21:32.526
and you took me in.

21:32.559 --> 21:34.394
And every night
after you go to sleep

21:34.427 --> 21:36.597
I work on it for one hour.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.633
So Happy Birthday.

21:45.371 --> 21:46.940
That what we say on Mypos.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.810
Because Christmas
is not just Christmas turtles

21:49.843 --> 21:52.579
and presents, it's also
the birthday of Baby Jesus.

21:55.015 --> 21:58.484
Yeah, I guess I forgot that too.

21:58.519 --> 22:00.687
But the sheepherders
never forget it.

22:00.721 --> 22:02.889
We were the first ones
to get the news, you know.

22:08.529 --> 22:10.463

Thank you, Balki.
Thank you very much.

22:12.799 --> 22:13.567
[sniffles]

22:14.901 --> 22:17.037
Are you okay?

22:17.070 --> 22:18.004
Yeah.

22:20.406 --> 22:23.710
[inhales]
I was just
remembering a, a Christmas

22:23.744 --> 22:27.147
when I was six years old.

22:27.180 --> 22:30.751
It was the first time
that‐that I realized that my dad

22:30.784 --> 22:32.553
buying presents
for my mom and saying

22:32.586 --> 22:35.556
they were from me wasn't enough.

22:35.589 --> 22:37.991
I, I wanted to get
her something myself

22:38.024 --> 22:39.893
but I didn't have any money

22:39.926 --> 22:42.896
so I made her a, a potholder.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.731
[chuckles]

22:44.765 --> 22:47.167
And it was really pretty ugly.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.536
[laughs]

22:49.570 --> 22:54.040
But when she saw it, she,
she cried and she hugged me

22:54.074 --> 22:56.877
and she told me it was
the nicest Christmas present

22:56.910 --> 23:00.113
anybody had ever given her.

23:00.146 --> 23:03.684
And I didn't really understand
what she meant till now.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.688
[crying]
Balki, this is
the nicest present

23:07.721 --> 23:09.623
anybody's ever given me.

[melancholic music]

Something's happening.

23:21.768 --> 23:22.703
What?

23:24.638 --> 23:26.472
Yes, there it is.

23:26.507 --> 23:28.642
There what is?

23:28.675 --> 23:30.711
It's the Christmas feeling.

23:30.744 --> 23:31.645
It's back.

The, the Christmas lights
come on.

23:39.485 --> 23:41.454
It's a Christmas miracle.

23:44.825 --> 23:46.693
You know, Balki,
I thought I was missing

and my friends.
