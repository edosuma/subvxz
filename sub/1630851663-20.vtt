that we lived in,

03:12.893 --> 03:15.395
which was basically the size
of, like, a litter box.

So it was actually Mooky
that came up with this product.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.600
He started taking
a little red ball

of a folding bookstand

around, grabbed a box cutter,

it was pretty much
like a hobby project.

It was selling
about like 20,000 a year.

for the customers.

want you to at least

06:01.761 --> 06:03.930
your motivation
is great and honorable,

-I appreciate it. Thank you.
-You're welcome, Andrey.

06:12.572 --> 06:14.608

It's the partner.

06:51.177 --> 06:53.146
we've just sold
to Hickory Farms.

06:53.146 --> 06:55.515
I never had equity,
but we were so incentivized

06:55.515 --> 06:57.050
to make the sales grow

06:57.050 --> 06:59.152
because I was getting
a royalty off every jar

that we turned it
into the number-one brand

17:16.802 --> 17:19.505
And what I wanted to do
was be in business for myself.

17:19.505 --> 17:20.840
We met in 2008,

17:20.840 --> 17:23.309
and within a few years,
we had three businesses.

17:23.309 --> 17:25.144
Wow.
We wanted to start

17:25.144 --> 17:27.346
an online retail store,
and so that's what we did.

17:27.346 --> 17:29.482
We took $300,
invested in some products.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.951
We would sell it,
take the profits,

17:31.951 --> 17:33.352
reinvest it,
and grew the business.

17:33.352 --> 17:34.820
Mindy: And then
we built that business

17:34.820 --> 17:36.689
to do over $8 million
in sales.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.758
-What?!
-Wow!

17:38.758 --> 17:40.526
-And where's that business now?
-What were you selling?

17:40.526 --> 17:43.262
So, shortly after
we hit that marker,

17:43.262 --> 17:46.566
we realized that that business
model was no longer sustainable

17:46.566 --> 17:48.267
for one of the biggest
selling platforms online,

17:48.267 --> 17:51.003
which I'm sure you could
figure out who that is.

17:51.003 --> 17:53.406
And then our reluctant
potty trainer, Ruby,

17:53.406 --> 17:54.674
starts to come into play.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.909
So being seasoned
entrepreneurs,

17:56.909 --> 17:59.211
we knew that we needed
to create something

17:59.211 --> 18:01.080
that was proprietary
to us,

18:01.080 --> 18:03.382
so no one else could
basically knock us off.

18:03.382 --> 18:05.751
And then Brandon thought
of this genius idea.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.820
I was looking at this
potty-training chart

18:07.820 --> 18:10.656
that my wife made,
and the chart was completed,

18:10.656 --> 18:14.660
and I missed buying the toy
to reward Ruby here.

18:14.660 --> 18:15.728
And I was looking at it,

18:15.728 --> 18:17.330
and I thought it looked
like a calendar.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.998
And I said, "Hey, honey,
why don't we make

18:18.998 --> 18:21.834
a potty-training
Advent chart?"

18:21.834 --> 18:23.069
Brilliant!

18:23.069 --> 18:24.770
So, what did you make
on the $300,000?

18:24.770 --> 18:26.872
We should profit
about $92,000 this year.

18:26.872 --> 18:28.107
-Wow.
-Good for you.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.809

And we're running about

18:29.809 --> 18:31.611
a net income of about 15%
for this year.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.946
Good for you.
Next year, on the track
we're going,

18:33.946 --> 18:36.182
we should do about 20 --
we should be hitting 20%.

18:36.182 --> 18:38.985
Well, also know that we are
all-in on this, as well.

18:38.985 --> 18:41.754
So, we saved a lot of money
from that other business

18:41.754 --> 18:43.089

18:43.089 --> 18:45.758
So we've been living off of
our savings this whole time.

any income for over two years.
