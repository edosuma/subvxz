00:02.569 --> 00:04.671
{\an5}(Nina Parker)
On "Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood
The Reunion"...

00:04.738 --> 00:07.574
it's lights, camera, drama.

00:07.640 --> 00:09.843
{\an5}Bitch, you a (bleep)
side ho.

00:07.640 --> 00:09.843
Aw, (bleep).

00:09.909 --> 00:12.145
No! (Bleep) her!

00:12.212 --> 00:13.346
Don't let this dress fool you!

00:13.413 --> 00:15.115
(Nina)
Emotions run high,

00:15.181 --> 00:16.783
when tea gets spilled...

00:16.850 --> 00:19.085
{\an5}You're on this stage
because of me.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.085
Who you talking to?

00:19.152 --> 00:21.154
{\an5}"I want you to kick this (bleep)
out and I'm getting back
in the bed with you."

00:21.221 --> 00:24.557
{\an5}What, she got (bleep)
two months ago, so what?

00:21.221 --> 00:24.557
My (bleep) good.

00:24.624 --> 00:26.226
Nikki, why you snitch
on a homie?

00:28.128 --> 00:30.163
(Nina)
...exes become enemies...

00:30.230 --> 00:32.332
(Bleep) doesn't
always work out.

00:32.399 --> 00:34.367
Who's ass did you beat?

00:34.434 --> 00:36.369
I know he was (bleep) up
for that (bleep).

00:36.436 --> 00:37.604
I'm done.

00:37.670 --> 00:39.839
(Nina)
...talking turns to tears...

00:39.906 --> 00:42.242
{\an1}These mother (bleep) want to
sit here and judge me?

00:42.308 --> 00:43.676
{\an1}(Moniece)
Aww, Nikki.

00:43.743 --> 00:46.246
He lied to me about being gay.

00:46.312 --> 00:47.947
(sobbing)

00:48.014 --> 00:49.916
(Nina)
...some accusations

00:49.983 --> 00:53.353
are just too hot
to handle.

00:53.420 --> 00:55.955
Hazel tried to shame me
for being gay.

00:56.022 --> 00:58.224
{\an5}Eat that, bitch.

00:56.022 --> 00:58.224
If nobody speaks up, I will.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.193
{\an1}I'm not gonna condone
bitch (bleep).

01:00.260 --> 01:03.096
{\an5}What's that, Rich?
My girl on some bitch?

01:00.260 --> 01:03.096
Ray, sit down.

01:03.163 --> 01:04.596
♪♪

01:04.664 --> 01:07.867
{\an5}(Nina)
And tonight on part one
of "The Reunion"...

01:07.934 --> 01:10.470
the cast glitters,
but their relationships

01:10.537 --> 01:12.472
are far from gold.

01:12.539 --> 01:14.174
Are you guys engaged?

01:14.240 --> 01:16.176
{\an5}That's not a relationship.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.176
I don't give a (bleep).

01:16.242 --> 01:18.445
Now where do we stand?
'Cause I'm still confused.

01:18.511 --> 01:21.047
{\an5}(Nina)
...the shade
is almost too real.

01:21.114 --> 01:22.515
You don't even have
a roof over your head.

01:22.582 --> 01:25.018
{\an5}You have TMZ on speed dial.

01:22.582 --> 01:25.018
Damn.

01:26.619 --> 01:29.055
(woman)
Plus, a betrayal bombshell

01:29.122 --> 01:33.092
we never saw coming.

01:33.159 --> 01:36.596
"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood
The Reunion" starts now.

01:36.663 --> 01:38.665
Don't tell me you didn't know,
'cause you know.

01:38.731 --> 01:41.668
{\an5}I'll (bleep) you up, ho!

01:38.731 --> 01:41.668
(Bleep) you, bitch!

01:54.781 --> 01:58.284
{\an5}(Nina)
Welcome to part one of "Love &amp;
Hip Hop Hollywood The Reunion."

01:58.351 --> 02:01.054
{\an8}I'm your host Nina Parker
and I hope you are ready

02:01.120 --> 02:02.889
{\an8}to feel the California
love tonight.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.625
Now, nobody serves up drama
quite like Hollywood,

02:05.692 --> 02:07.927
and this season
was no exception.

02:07.994 --> 02:10.697
And now, please give
a warm welcome

02:10.763 --> 02:13.233
to the cast of
"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood."

02:13.299 --> 02:16.069
{\an5}(cheering and applause)

02:13.299 --> 02:16.069
Joining me on stage are,

02:16.135 --> 02:18.638
Ray J, Teairra,

02:18.705 --> 02:21.007
Princess, Moniece,

02:21.074 --> 02:23.476
Nikki, Fizz,

02:23.543 --> 02:26.045
Brandi, and Hazel.

02:26.112 --> 02:29.983
And kicking it on the couches
are, Rich Dollaz,

02:30.049 --> 02:32.418
Willie, Max,

02:32.485 --> 02:36.489
Shanda, Amber, Milan,

02:36.556 --> 02:40.994
Soulja Boy, and Miles.

02:41.060 --> 02:43.630
{\an1}Where Omarion at?
Where Omarion and Apryl at?

02:43.696 --> 02:45.365
I was getting to that.

02:45.431 --> 02:47.700
Omarion and Apryl were "pose"
to be here tonight.

02:47.767 --> 02:51.704
{\an5}So, Fizz, I know
you're close with Omarion,
have you spoken to them?

02:51.771 --> 02:54.007
{\an8}Yeah, you know, he's just
focused on his music right now

02:54.073 --> 02:56.843
{\an8}and just got off a big tour,
so he trying to rest up.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.546
{\an5}(Nina) We're sad the touring
schedule prevented them
from being here tonight.

02:59.612 --> 03:01.314
{\an5}(Ray J)
Oh, they "pose" to be here?
Oh, I get it.

03:01.381 --> 03:03.216
{\an5}You got that?

03:01.381 --> 03:03.216
Oh, I got it.

03:03.283 --> 03:05.952
All right, so there is
a lot to talk about tonight,

03:06.019 --> 03:08.721
so make sure you make those
social media timelines

03:08.788 --> 03:11.524
{\an8}bling with
the hashtag #LHHReunion

03:11.591 --> 03:13.226
{\an8}and the cast has been doing

03:13.293 --> 03:15.295
{\an8}a lot of thumb-thugging
on social media,

03:15.361 --> 03:18.531
so they will definitely get
a chance to publicly clap back

03:18.598 --> 03:21.901
at some of those shots fired
throughout the evening.

03:21.968 --> 03:23.803
Aw, (bleep).

03:23.870 --> 03:26.839
{\an5}(Nina)
So we are gonna dive right in
with Ray J and Princess.

03:26.906 --> 03:29.776
Now, their lease on love
almost expired this season.

03:29.842 --> 03:32.412
Shortly after things
with his apartment blew up,

03:32.478 --> 03:34.981
Princess evicted Ray J
from her heart,

03:35.048 --> 03:37.317
{\an1}leaving him wondering
if she would ever

03:37.383 --> 03:39.852
{\an1}move back into his life,
check it out.

03:39.919 --> 03:41.988
{\an5}(Princess)
I'm so done with Ray
at this point.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.223
Like, I caught him trying to
hook up with strippers,

03:44.290 --> 03:46.960
{\an8}and when I confronted him about
it, we got into a huge fight.

03:47.026 --> 03:49.862
{\an8}And when the police came,
I'm the one that went to jail.

03:49.929 --> 03:52.098
{\an8}What do I gotta do
to bring you back home?

03:52.165 --> 03:54.634
{\an7}First, you can start off by
getting rid of your apartment.

03:54.701 --> 03:56.169
{\an8}I (bleep) love you,
I want to be with you.

03:56.235 --> 03:57.737
{\an8}(Bleep) that apartment.

03:57.804 --> 03:59.606
{\an8}♪♪

04:00.707 --> 04:03.643
{\an8}(man) A-P-T.

04:00.707 --> 04:03.643
{\an8}(woman) A-P-T...

04:06.346 --> 04:07.614
{\an8}Oh!

04:07.680 --> 04:10.183
{\an7}Yo, baby, chill.
What the (bleep) is you doing?

04:10.249 --> 04:12.885
{\an7}So you don't want to be
with me no more?

04:12.952 --> 04:14.887
{\an8}I've lost
my respect for you.

04:16.789 --> 04:18.491
{\an8}You a bitch-ass (bleep).

04:18.558 --> 04:21.293
{\an8}I got this house
for you and me.

04:18.558 --> 04:21.293
{\an5}You bought a house?

04:21.361 --> 04:23.029
{\an8}I'm done with that
crazy (bleep) I do.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.431
{\an8}(Ray J)
I want to give her
something special

04:25.498 --> 04:28.534
{\an8}so when she looks in my eyes,
she sees her future,

04:28.601 --> 04:30.770
{\an8}our future, together.

04:30.837 --> 04:33.006
{\an8}(cheering and applause)

04:34.907 --> 04:36.676
(Nina)
That's a big step.

04:36.743 --> 04:38.611
Now, Princess,
Ray J gave you a ring.

04:38.678 --> 04:41.414
{\an8}Can you let me know,
are you guys engaged?

04:41.481 --> 04:42.982
{\an8}Yes, we are.

04:43.049 --> 04:45.485
(man)
Nice. Nice.

04:47.820 --> 04:50.256
Princess, let's backtrack
just a little bit,

04:50.323 --> 04:52.959
because we want to talk about
New Orleans a little bit.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.927
So Princess says
that you ditched her

04:54.994 --> 04:57.330
to go to a party
with strippers?

04:57.397 --> 05:00.366
{\an5}No, that's not what happened.

04:57.397 --> 05:00.366
No, I was at the strip club.

05:00.433 --> 05:03.569
I was in the hotel, waiting for
him to bring me some soul food.

05:03.636 --> 05:04.737
I (bleep) up.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.073
{\an8}My friends told me
to meet them somewhere

05:07.140 --> 05:08.908
{\an8}and I was gonna be
like 10 minutes.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.908
{\an4}Okay.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.377
And then when I got in there--
when I got in there,

05:11.444 --> 05:12.979
I was in there all night.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.847
Look, I was already
on probation,

05:14.914 --> 05:17.383
{\an1}so when we had got into it,
it got, like, heated.

05:17.450 --> 05:20.453
When the police came,
I was like,

05:20.520 --> 05:22.422
{\an1}I don't know what's going on,
I don't remember nothing.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.824
And so since I wasn't
cooperating with them,

05:24.891 --> 05:26.025
they were like,
we're taking you.

05:26.092 --> 05:28.094
What-- Legally,
where do you stand now?

05:28.161 --> 05:29.962
{\an5}She's straight.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.962
They-- Actually,
they dropped the case.

05:30.029 --> 05:32.398
{\an5}They dropped the case, okay.

05:30.029 --> 05:32.398
{\an3}Yeah.

05:32.465 --> 05:34.701
When you guys were...

05:34.767 --> 05:36.836
{\an1}I (bleep) up.
I told you I (bleep) up.

05:36.903 --> 05:38.938
{\an3}Stop.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.274
{\an4}She didn't buy that one.
That was a TV apology.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.274
{\an3}No.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.109
Now, she accused you of
letting her get arrested

05:43.176 --> 05:45.878
and lying to the press,
is that something you do?

05:45.945 --> 05:48.981
{\an5}Do you leak stories?

05:45.945 --> 05:48.981
How can a story get leaked?

05:49.048 --> 05:51.184
{\an1}Like, we tried to hide it for,
like, two weeks,

05:51.250 --> 05:53.352
{\an1}and then it came out
some other kind of way.

05:53.419 --> 05:54.721
You know what I'm saying?

05:54.787 --> 05:56.322
Teairra, you had a comment
about this during the show.

05:56.389 --> 05:57.957
{\an4}Mm-hmm.

05:56.389 --> 05:57.957
Does he leak stories
to the press?

05:58.024 --> 05:59.992
{\an5}It's the truth, it's the truth.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.992
{\an3}Okay.

06:00.059 --> 06:02.261
I mean, just 'cause people care
about what I do in the press

06:02.328 --> 06:04.530
more than what she does in
the press, doesn't mean like--

06:04.597 --> 06:05.998
You know what I'm saying?
I can't--

06:06.065 --> 06:07.467
You know what I'm saying?

06:07.533 --> 06:08.935
Like, it just doesn't work
like that, I don't--

06:09.001 --> 06:11.037
{\an7}No, it's just because
you have TMZ on speed dial.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.638
{\an8}How do I have TMZ
on speed dial?

06:11.104 --> 06:12.638
{\an5}'Cause you do.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.407
{\an1}Why am I leaking
bad stories about me?

06:14.474 --> 06:16.442
{\an5}It doesn't make any sense.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.442
Okay, I got you.

06:16.509 --> 06:17.844
{\an5}That's all I'm saying.

06:16.509 --> 06:17.844
I understand.

06:17.910 --> 06:19.545
{\an1}After last season's feuds,
Teairra and Princess

06:19.612 --> 06:21.914
shocked us by having
a heart-to-heart.

06:21.981 --> 06:24.717
They even had a brief friendship
until Teairra decided

06:24.784 --> 06:27.320
to meddle in Princess'
relationship with Ray

06:27.386 --> 06:30.456
by keeping her enemies close
and her phone closer.

06:30.523 --> 06:32.125
Take a look.

06:32.191 --> 06:33.760
All the (bleep) that
I've been hearing in the news

06:33.826 --> 06:35.995
{\an4}about you and him is that--
All violence.

06:33.826 --> 06:35.995
{\an3}Not true.

06:36.062 --> 06:39.565
{\an5}He took that and ran with it.

06:36.062 --> 06:39.565
You don't want that.

06:39.632 --> 06:41.701
You good?

06:41.768 --> 06:44.670
{\an7}I feel like we could,
you know...

06:44.737 --> 06:45.838
{\an9}Be friends?

06:44.737 --> 06:45.838
{\an7}Yes.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.875
{\an9}Say it.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.875
{\an8}Yeah, be friends.

06:48.941 --> 06:51.244
{\an7}Well, tonight, Drake's
having a party at his house,

06:51.310 --> 06:53.112
{\an8}if you want to roll,
you can roll.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.948
{\an8}(Teairra)
What a surprise,
I keep Princess out all night,

06:56.015 --> 06:59.485
{\an8}and right on cue, the next day,
Ray is blowing up my phone.

06:59.552 --> 07:01.854
{\an7}You know, we just start talking
and it just went where it went,
you know?

07:01.921 --> 07:03.790
{\an8}Where did it go, though?

07:01.921 --> 07:03.790
{\an8}She seemed very stressed out,

07:03.856 --> 07:05.424
{\an7}Ray, I don't know what
y'all going through.

07:05.491 --> 07:08.261
{\an8}Ray J's relationship was
in trouble before I started

07:08.327 --> 07:09.695
{\an8}getting friendly
with Princess,

07:09.762 --> 07:12.298
{\an8}but I'm sure I can speed up
the breakup process.

07:12.365 --> 07:15.401
{\an7}How the hell he find
that (bleep) out, Princess?

07:12.365 --> 07:15.401
{\an5}How you think he found out?

07:15.468 --> 07:17.069
{\an8}What I'm gonna do is...

07:17.136 --> 07:19.105
{\an8}What you about to do?

07:17.136 --> 07:19.105
{\an8}...the rat trap.

07:19.172 --> 07:22.241
{\an8}If Ray finds out about
this little invitation
that I gave to Teairra,

07:22.308 --> 07:24.210
{\an8}then I know that girl
is playing games.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.711
{\an8}Have you been
in contact with Ray.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.713
{\an8}Yeah, I sent him
a text message.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.081
{\an8}You're unloyal
to everybody

07:29.148 --> 07:31.117
{\an8}because you (bleep)
everybody's (bleep).

07:31.184 --> 07:32.785
{\an8}Oh, and what do you do?

07:32.852 --> 07:34.353
{\an8}(Brandi)
I can't watch this.

07:34.420 --> 07:36.088
{\an9}Bitch.

07:34.420 --> 07:36.088
{\an8}Bitch, I'll (bleep) you up.

07:36.155 --> 07:37.790
{\an8}Don't (bleep) with me.

07:37.857 --> 07:39.292
{\an8}You're (bleep) nasty.

07:39.358 --> 07:41.060
{\an8}You got me (bleep) up.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.963
{\an8}(cheering and applause)

07:44.030 --> 07:46.566
{\an5}(Nina)
Teairra, when you
saw her in tears

07:46.632 --> 07:48.434
and you guys
really squashed it,

07:48.501 --> 07:50.703
why not leave it at that
and move forward?

07:50.770 --> 07:52.538
{\an5}It just went a little left.

07:50.770 --> 07:52.538
{\an3}Okay.

07:52.605 --> 07:55.775
{\an5}So, Ray, when you found out
that Teairra was hanging
with Princess,

07:55.842 --> 07:58.277
kind of asked her to report
back to you a little bit.

07:58.344 --> 08:00.613
So do you feel responsible
for kind of

08:00.680 --> 08:02.849
fueling it a little
further than it went?

08:02.915 --> 08:05.985
{\an1}She started saying,
"You hurt, huh?

08:06.052 --> 08:07.687
"I can tell it in your tone.

08:07.753 --> 08:10.289
You feel like..."

08:10.356 --> 08:12.058
Then she go,
"You know what?

08:12.124 --> 08:13.826
"Soon as I found out
all the information,

08:13.893 --> 08:16.596
{\an5}I want you to kick this (bleep)
out and I'm getting back
in the bed with you."

08:16.662 --> 08:19.165
{\an5}(audience oohing)

08:16.662 --> 08:19.165
I never said that.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.100
{\an5}You told me, just make sure--

08:19.232 --> 08:21.100
Be back in the bed?

08:21.167 --> 08:23.035
{\an1}Oh, I'm gonna be back in
the bed with you? No, (bleep).

08:23.102 --> 08:26.038
{\an5}We gonna (bleep), like,
if I wanted to say something,
that's what I would have said.

08:26.105 --> 08:27.640
(Nina)
Okay.

08:27.707 --> 08:29.609
Well, now it is time
for a clap back.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.345
During a "Check Yourself"
segment on VH1.com,

08:32.410 --> 08:34.547
Moniece felt
a certain type of way

08:34.614 --> 08:36.414
when watching Princess
confront Teairra.

08:36.482 --> 08:37.884
Check it out.

08:37.950 --> 08:39.784
{\an8}He does not want
your fat ass!

08:39.852 --> 08:43.489
{\an8}Bitch!

08:39.852 --> 08:43.489
{\an8}Yeah, fat ass!
He don't want you!

08:43.556 --> 08:45.391
{\an8}What does she mean
he's not gonna want her?

08:45.458 --> 08:47.059
{\an8}He doesn't even
want you, bitch.

08:47.126 --> 08:49.595
{\an8}Why do you think he's made you
sit in the house for two years?

08:49.662 --> 08:51.697
{\an8}(audience oohing)

08:51.764 --> 08:54.634
{\an5}(Nina)
Princess, we are giving you
an opportunity to clap back

08:54.700 --> 08:56.469
at that if you would
like to.

08:56.535 --> 08:58.504
I don't even know you, but
you've been going on interviews

08:58.571 --> 09:01.274
for the past two years
speaking about me,

09:01.340 --> 09:03.309
saying I don't have no backbone.
Like, you don't know me.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.645
{\an8}You know, that scene,
she said some things

09:05.711 --> 09:07.480
{\an8}that were triggers for me.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.480
{\an8}Okay.

09:07.546 --> 09:10.349
{\an5}What was the comment?

09:07.546 --> 09:10.349
Something along the lines of,

09:10.416 --> 09:12.184
"You have a baby,
you don't even--

09:12.251 --> 09:15.288
{\an5}Go take care of
your son, bitch."

09:12.251 --> 09:15.288
I did not say that.

09:15.354 --> 09:18.024
{\an1}You don't even have a roof over
your head to speak about me.

09:18.090 --> 09:19.659
{\an5}And the only thing I said--

09:18.090 --> 09:19.659
(audience shouting)

09:19.725 --> 09:22.628
{\an5}(Teairra)
She has a house,
she has a house.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.864
{\an5}Never said nothing about you.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.864
Beano, Beano.

09:24.931 --> 09:27.166
Beano, Beano, Beano.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.935
That's my safe word.

09:29.001 --> 09:30.836
{\an5}She's gonna take a moment.

09:29.001 --> 09:30.836
(Teairra) Take a moment.

09:30.903 --> 09:33.005
{\an1}I didn't know
what she was doing.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.708
{\an5}We not fighting today.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.708
(Princess) Sit down.

09:35.775 --> 09:37.343
(applause)

09:37.410 --> 09:39.211
{\an5}(Ray J)
I'm saying is,
Moniece talk a lot of (bleep)

09:39.278 --> 09:40.513
with people she can pick on.

09:40.579 --> 09:43.282
When people she can't pick on,
then she want to--

09:43.349 --> 09:46.085
{\an5}(Rich)
Whoa, whoa, what we not
gonna do is do that.

09:46.152 --> 09:48.487
{\an8}What we not gonna do
is do that.

09:48.554 --> 09:49.855
(cheering and applause)

09:49.922 --> 09:51.624
All right?
Like, come on.

09:51.691 --> 09:53.359
As long as she
(bleep) with me,

09:53.426 --> 09:56.228
she gonna have a roof
because I'm Rich.

09:56.295 --> 09:58.664
So I will provide that,
always.

09:58.731 --> 10:02.101
At this point in time, me and
Moniece aren't even together,

10:02.168 --> 10:05.204
but we're not gonna
condone (bleep).

10:05.271 --> 10:08.074
(Ray J)
And what's that?

10:08.140 --> 10:09.842
Hold on.
What's that, Rich?

10:09.909 --> 10:11.711
What's that?
What is that?

10:11.777 --> 10:14.013
What--
My girl on some (bleep)?

10:14.080 --> 10:16.682
{\an5}Ray, sit down.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.682
What's (bleep)?

10:18.250 --> 10:19.919
What's-- what's--
what's (bleep), though?

10:19.986 --> 10:22.221
{\an5}(Nina) Let's talk, let's talk.

10:19.986 --> 10:22.221
(Rich) What I won't allow

10:22.288 --> 10:25.291
is for people to berate her
with stuff that's not true.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.493
{\an5}Okay, so what I won't allow--

10:25.358 --> 10:27.493
She does-- she does have custody

10:27.560 --> 10:30.496
and she does work with Fizz
on their relationship

10:30.563 --> 10:32.365
as regards to their child.

10:32.431 --> 10:33.766
Fizz, you had something
you wanted to clear up?

10:33.833 --> 10:35.768
She definitely got
a roof over her head.

10:35.835 --> 10:38.170
{\an5}She has a roof over her head.

10:35.835 --> 10:38.170
(applause)

10:38.237 --> 10:40.773
{\an5}(Nina)
I know that you guys have
your own issues with Moniece,

10:40.840 --> 10:42.708
{\an8}but we're gonna discuss
this a little bit later.

10:42.775 --> 10:44.343
{\an8}She's not here right now
to defend herself,

10:44.410 --> 10:46.746
{\an8}so she is watching,
but she needed a moment.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.615
{\an8}But first, it's time for
tonight's hashtag battle.

10:49.682 --> 10:52.318
{\an5}Now, a lot of the guys here
messed up in their
relationships,

10:52.385 --> 10:55.588
{\an5}so which one do you think
belongs in the dog house
the most?

10:55.654 --> 10:58.357
{\an5}Soulja Boy.

10:55.654 --> 10:58.357
If you think ring-throwing Max

10:58.424 --> 11:00.926
deserves it,
hashtag #MaxDog,

11:00.993 --> 11:04.063
if you think A-P-T
party-throwing Ray J

11:04.130 --> 11:06.999
belongs there,
hashtag #RayDog,

11:07.066 --> 11:09.869
and if you thing two-timing
Soulja needs to go,

11:09.935 --> 11:13.272
hashtag #SouljaDog.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.241
We'll reveal the winner
later in the show.

11:15.307 --> 11:16.275
{\an5}Congratulations.

11:15.307 --> 11:16.275
It's time for a break.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.610
Y'all tripping.

11:17.676 --> 11:19.178
{\an5}(Nina)
Now that Richie D
has called it quits,

11:19.245 --> 11:22.415
are Fizz and Moniece ready
to give love another try?

11:22.481 --> 11:24.183
Find out when we return.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.185
Stop it.

11:27.987 --> 11:30.723
{\an8}These mother(bleep) want to
sit here and judge me?

11:30.790 --> 11:32.925
{\an8}I didn't Richie D
this situation.

11:32.992 --> 11:34.627
{\an8}If nobody speaks up, I will.

11:34.693 --> 11:37.430
{\an8}Please don't make excuses,
ever, about being a mother.

11:37.496 --> 11:39.532
{\an8}Who you talking to?

11:37.496 --> 11:39.532
{\an8}You are not--

11:39.598 --> 11:40.666
{\an8}You don't want that!

11:48.441 --> 11:51.677
{\an8}Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood The Reunion."

11:51.744 --> 11:54.980
{\an8}I'm Nina Parker,
joined now by Rich Dollaz.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.649
Moniece is back with us.

11:56.715 --> 11:58.017
Are you okay?
You good?

11:58.084 --> 12:00.619
All right,
and her mom, Marla.

12:00.686 --> 12:04.090
All right, now,
a lot of people were shocked

12:04.156 --> 12:06.459
when Rich Dollaz ditched
the New York Creep Squad

12:06.525 --> 12:08.761
for the L.A. life
with Moniece.

12:08.828 --> 12:11.597
Things with the couple were good
until Marla started questioning

12:11.664 --> 12:14.533
Richie D's past,
which jeopardized their future.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.968
Watch.

12:16.035 --> 12:17.903
Slaughter!

12:17.970 --> 12:20.973
{\an1}I'm in love with none other
than Richie D.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.142
{\an4}I'm here.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.142
Love you.

12:23.209 --> 12:26.645
{\an7}I'm thinking
you should stay...

12:26.712 --> 12:28.280
{\an8}forever.

12:31.383 --> 12:33.185
{\an8}I'm bicoastal right now.

12:31.383 --> 12:33.185
{\an8}I don't like it.

12:33.252 --> 12:36.856
{\an7}And we're working on making this
a much bigger situation.

12:39.291 --> 12:41.260
{\an8}(Rich)
So after the first week
here with Mo-Mo,

12:41.327 --> 12:42.828
{\an8}I went back to New York,
and you know what?

12:42.895 --> 12:44.163
{\an8}I couldn't stop
thinking about her.

12:44.230 --> 12:46.065
{\an8}So I've decided to go ahead
and take the plunge.

12:46.132 --> 12:48.067
{\an8}Who would have thought?

12:48.134 --> 12:49.735
{\an7}Well, I'm really happy,
and I'm even happier

12:49.802 --> 12:51.437
{\an7}that we're going to dinner
with my mom.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.205
{\an7}Surprise!

12:53.272 --> 12:56.876
{\an7}The child support thing came up
during my investigation,

12:56.942 --> 12:58.744
{\an7}and that's
a big thing for me.

12:58.811 --> 13:01.413
{\an8}Let's move on from that.

12:58.811 --> 13:01.413
{\an8}I don't know you.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.983
{\an8}You don't know me to
question my relationships.

13:04.049 --> 13:06.385
{\an8}(Moniece)
I was really hoping,
that for one night,

13:06.452 --> 13:09.388
{\an8}my mom could put her guns away,
but I guess not.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.590
Ahh!

13:11.657 --> 13:13.559
{\an8}(cheering and applause)

13:16.228 --> 13:17.930
{\an1}Whoo!
Turn up, turn up!

13:17.997 --> 13:19.832
{\an5}(Nina)
So, Rich, what was it
about Moniece

13:19.899 --> 13:23.636
that made you really want to
start to change your ways?

13:23.702 --> 13:25.771
{\an8}I mean, initially, we just--

13:25.838 --> 13:27.806
{\an8}we connected,
so we started hanging out.

13:27.873 --> 13:29.241
{\an8}It was just a good vibe.

13:27.873 --> 13:29.241
{\an9}Okay.

13:29.308 --> 13:30.776
{\an8}You know what I'm saying?

13:30.843 --> 13:32.511
So couple that with
the fact that, you know,

13:32.578 --> 13:34.647
she's an attractive woman
and it's like okay, well,

13:34.713 --> 13:36.115
{\an1}she seems like she's got
her (bleep) together.

13:36.182 --> 13:38.050
Let's see what's up.

13:38.117 --> 13:39.485
{\an1}And that's kind of
how it started.

13:39.552 --> 13:42.955
Moniece, we know, you know, Rich
has been on "Love &amp; Hip Hop"

13:43.022 --> 13:46.091
and he is known for being
affiliated with the Creep Squad.

13:46.158 --> 13:49.195
{\an5}Did that ever concern you?

13:46.158 --> 13:49.195
Creep Squad!

13:49.261 --> 13:50.362
It's what we do.

13:50.429 --> 13:52.464
{\an8}No, it didn't
really concern me

13:52.531 --> 13:55.334
{\an8}because everyone has a past.

13:52.531 --> 13:55.334
{\an8}Right.

13:55.401 --> 13:58.671
And I didn't want to judge him
based off of that,

13:58.737 --> 14:02.408
{\an5}I only wanted to judge him
based off of how he treated me.

13:58.737 --> 14:02.408
{\an1}Okay.

14:02.474 --> 14:05.211
(applause)

14:05.277 --> 14:07.813
Now, Marla,
I know that you had

14:07.880 --> 14:09.782
reservations about Rich
from the beginning.

14:09.848 --> 14:11.984
Um, it seemed like you were--

14:12.051 --> 14:14.553
you looked at the Internet
and pre-judged him.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.589
Why trust that before

14:16.655 --> 14:18.857
having an actual
conversation with him?

14:18.924 --> 14:21.160
Um, I really
didn't think,

14:21.227 --> 14:23.195
{\an8}even in what I was asking,

14:23.262 --> 14:25.764
{\an5}would be so offensive
because it was public.

14:23.262 --> 14:25.764
{\an1}Okay.

14:25.831 --> 14:29.435
Rich has
a "self-proclaimed" title

14:29.501 --> 14:31.804
as you guys are all yelling out,
"Creep Squad"!

14:31.870 --> 14:35.641
So to me, that is what
he was saying he was.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.343
{\an5}Mmm.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.343
You have a response, Rich?
I'm hearing you over here.

14:37.409 --> 14:38.811
{\an1}Well,
this is my thing.

14:38.877 --> 14:42.448
I'm not gonna sit here and say
that Marla is 100% wrong.

14:42.514 --> 14:45.417
I just think there's
a method to the madness,

14:45.484 --> 14:47.186
but the delivery sucks.

14:47.253 --> 14:49.822
I pay $3,000 a week
child support.

14:49.888 --> 14:51.557
Understand that.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.592
I didn't say $3,000 a month.

14:53.659 --> 14:57.463
I didn't say $3,000--
I said $3,000 a week, okay?

14:57.529 --> 14:59.431
That's 156 a year.

14:59.498 --> 15:00.733
(Teairra)
That's absurd.

15:00.799 --> 15:02.101
{\an5}(Rich)
Understand.
'Cause you know what?

15:02.167 --> 15:04.169
Shade Room is gonna post
100 Ray J (bleep),

15:04.236 --> 15:07.239
Soulja Boy gonna do something,
but for five minutes,

15:07.306 --> 15:10.643
nobody wants to do the real
research about what's going on.

15:10.709 --> 15:13.679
{\an5}Okay. All right, now,
Rich may have thought
Moniece was the one,

15:13.746 --> 15:16.949
{\an5}but when Nikki found out
she wanted a dab of
Fizz's Good Lotion,

15:17.016 --> 15:19.585
she pumped that information
right back to Rich

15:19.652 --> 15:22.388
and it didn't go smoothly.
Watch.

15:22.454 --> 15:25.924

Meet with baby daddy.

15:25.991 --> 15:29.561
{\an8}Well, the blasé-blasé
is ring shopping.

I have to tell you something.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.403
{\an4}What?

15:37.469 --> 15:39.972
{\an8}I still love you,
I will always love you,

15:40.039 --> 15:43.208
{\an8}and all these feelings
are coming up.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.878

I never left?

15:45.944 --> 15:48.347

15:51.884 --> 15:53.719
{\an8}I saw Fizz
and he was like,

15:53.786 --> 15:56.188
{\an7}you know, "Moniece was
getting really emotional today

15:56.255 --> 15:58.390
{\an8}and admitted to me she was
still in love with me."

15:58.457 --> 15:59.725
{\an9}What?

15:59.792 --> 16:02.394
{\an8}Your girl is in love
with her baby daddy.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.730
{\an7}Now, here I am
with this in hand,

16:04.797 --> 16:07.933
{\an7}coming here to tell you that
I want you to be mine forever,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.569
{\an7}and I got some (bleep)
news about a (bleep)

16:10.636 --> 16:12.705
{\an7}who-- who--
You needed closure for that.

16:12.771 --> 16:14.373
{\an8}So it wasn't about me.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.208
{\an7}It wasn't about
moving forward with me.

16:16.275 --> 16:18.077
{\an7}It wasn't about
none of that!

16:18.143 --> 16:21.213
{\an7}Tell that (bleep) to give you
the mother(bleep) ring!

16:21.280 --> 16:22.915
{\an8}(audience oohing)

16:22.981 --> 16:25.718
All right, Moniece,
let me ask you this.

16:25.784 --> 16:27.986
I would like to take
the time to clarify,

16:28.053 --> 16:30.022
in that scene,
when you hear me say,

16:30.089 --> 16:31.223
"What if I had never left?"

16:31.290 --> 16:33.592
I said to Dreux several times,

16:33.659 --> 16:36.929
{\an1}I'm not here to tell you that
I want a relationship with you,

16:36.995 --> 16:39.765
I'm here to tell you that
this is my first time

16:39.832 --> 16:42.735
that I get to actually
grieve this relationship

16:42.801 --> 16:45.671
and bring closure to this
because I'm ready to move on.

16:45.738 --> 16:48.207
I was fighting by myself.

16:48.273 --> 16:52.644
So what I felt
didn't matter.

16:52.711 --> 16:56.281
I didn't have time
to consider me.

16:56.348 --> 16:59.351
And these mother(bleep) want
to sit here and judge me?

16:59.418 --> 17:02.588
I was on a bus
to go see my son,

17:02.654 --> 17:04.256
because I went from
having my son

17:04.323 --> 17:06.692
six days a week
to six hours a week.

17:06.759 --> 17:10.396
I didn't pop that baby out
and say, here you go.

17:10.462 --> 17:11.964
I had no one.

17:12.030 --> 17:14.199
So now, I can say this.

17:14.266 --> 17:17.803
I'm always gonna love him,
or Kameron wouldn't be here.

17:17.869 --> 17:20.372
{\an5}But it wasn't in the place
that it was perceived.

17:17.869 --> 17:20.372
It was not like-- No.

17:20.439 --> 17:22.441
Rich, she's saying that
it was a closure conversation.

17:22.508 --> 17:23.976
{\an5}Does that--

17:22.508 --> 17:23.976
{\an3}No.

17:24.041 --> 17:27.512
{\an5}Were you aware of that?

17:24.041 --> 17:27.512
I'm very aware of
the conversation.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.214
I moved to L.A.

17:29.281 --> 17:31.350
I didn't Richie D
this situation.

17:31.417 --> 17:34.286
I came out here and did
the right thing by Moniece,

17:34.353 --> 17:37.556
every (bleep) step of the way,
so let's be clear.

17:37.623 --> 17:39.091
I love this girl.

17:39.158 --> 17:41.293
{\an5}(audience awwing)

17:39.158 --> 17:41.293
And that's never been an issue.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.529
That's never been an issue.

17:43.595 --> 17:47.266
{\an5}But (bleep) doesn't
always work out.

17:43.595 --> 17:47.266
Okay.

17:47.332 --> 17:48.934
Moniece, from the information
that Rich gathered,

17:49.001 --> 17:50.469
he decided to end
the relationship.

17:50.536 --> 17:51.804
But then later,
on social media,

17:51.870 --> 17:53.906
you insinuated that
you guys were engaged.

17:53.972 --> 17:55.841
Can you clear that up?

17:55.908 --> 17:58.143
We were repairing
the relationship.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.846
He texts me, said he
wanted to marry me,

18:00.913 --> 18:04.817
wanted to get engaged, and that
was where I thought we were.

18:04.883 --> 18:07.219
{\an5}(Nina)
So you guys got back together.

18:04.883 --> 18:07.219
Yeah.

18:07.286 --> 18:09.188
But then earlier,
you know, when I departed,

18:09.254 --> 18:12.691
and I was watching backstage,
he said we weren't together.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.693
I knew that
we were on the rocks,

18:14.760 --> 18:16.762
{\an1}I knew that things were shaky,
but I thought we were

18:16.829 --> 18:19.698
working things out,
but apparently, I was wrong.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.000
{\an5}(audience awwing)

18:19.765 --> 18:22.000
Um...

18:22.067 --> 18:23.902
{\an5}(Nina)
She's saying she didn't know
you guys were broken up.

18:23.969 --> 18:25.204
Were you aware of that?

18:25.270 --> 18:27.306
Me and Moniece been
on the rocks for a minute now.

18:27.372 --> 18:29.508
{\an5}But she's saying--

18:27.372 --> 18:29.508
{\an1}On the rocks is not broken up,
I didn't know--

18:29.575 --> 18:30.909
On the rocks
and broken up is different.

18:30.976 --> 18:32.744
{\an1}At that moment that I feel
(bleep) is going left,

18:32.811 --> 18:34.480
{\an1}then I might-- then
I need to act on that.

18:34.546 --> 18:37.749
{\an8}When did it begin to get
rocky for you and Moniece

18:37.816 --> 18:39.985
{\an5}if it didn't start
with Nikki?

18:37.816 --> 18:39.985
That's part of it.

18:40.052 --> 18:41.386
{\an1}Don't say it had something
to do with Nikki, 'cause, baby,

18:41.453 --> 18:42.921
{\an1}you knew before Nikki
even popped into--

18:42.988 --> 18:44.223
Yo, don't--
don't flatter yourself.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.824
{\an5}(Nina)
All right, Fizz,
do you think

18:45.891 --> 18:47.493
that his interest in her
was genuine

18:47.559 --> 18:48.961
{\an8}or do you think he was
being an opportunist?

18:49.027 --> 18:50.329
{\an8}I do, I sat down with him,
we talked on the phone.

18:50.395 --> 18:51.797
{\an7}But he e-mailed you saying that
he was looking for a way out,

18:51.864 --> 18:53.599
{\an8}so that's a lie.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.599
{\an8}(Fizz)
No, no, no. No, no, no.

18:53.665 --> 18:55.000
{\an5}That's a lie.

18:53.665 --> 18:55.000
No, no, no.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.435
{\an5}What do you mean "no, no, no"?

18:55.067 --> 18:56.435
(Nina) There was an e-mail?

18:56.502 --> 18:57.769
{\an5}That's wrong.

18:56.502 --> 18:57.769
No, let me finish.

18:57.836 --> 18:59.805
{\an4}If nobody speaks up,
I will, because--

18:57.836 --> 18:59.805
Let me finish.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.607
{\an1}That's the mother of your child,
you gotta protect her.

19:01.673 --> 19:03.442
If you don't, I will,
because that's wrong.

19:03.509 --> 19:05.911
{\an5}When me and him had our talk--
when me and him had our talk.

19:03.509 --> 19:05.911
(Nina) Yes.

19:05.978 --> 19:10.148
He said, "Yo, Moniece came to
me, she feels like maybe she--

19:10.215 --> 19:11.917
"It might still be something
there because of the way

19:11.984 --> 19:13.785
that you're supporting
her now."

19:13.852 --> 19:16.522
{\an5}I said, "I'm not trying to be
back in a relationship
with Moniece."

19:16.588 --> 19:18.991
After I said this,
he said, "All right, bro,

19:19.057 --> 19:21.260
{\an5}I'm trying to figure things
out 'cause this could
be my way out."

19:21.326 --> 19:24.229
{\an5}Thank you. That's wrong.

19:21.326 --> 19:24.229
When he said that,
I felt like it came from--

19:24.296 --> 19:26.398
{\an5}When he said that--

19:24.296 --> 19:26.398
That don't seem like
genuine to me.

19:26.465 --> 19:28.300
{\an5}Rich, there's a question
I want to know.

19:26.465 --> 19:28.300
You have a question for Rich?

19:28.367 --> 19:30.802
I just got a question
for this whole situation.

19:30.869 --> 19:33.639
{\an5}Nikki, why you snitch
on the homie, man?

19:30.869 --> 19:33.639
(audience oohing)

19:33.705 --> 19:35.874
If this man is telling you,
"That's my way out,"

19:35.941 --> 19:37.309
that don't seem
genuine to me.

19:37.376 --> 19:39.545
{\an1}So your job,
as being in her life,

19:39.611 --> 19:41.747
is to let her know,
to protect her.

19:41.813 --> 19:43.715
What I will say is this.

19:43.782 --> 19:47.920
I don't need
no mother(bleep) help

19:47.986 --> 19:50.722
getting out of
a goddamn relationship

19:50.789 --> 19:52.257
I don't want to be in.

19:52.324 --> 19:54.326
So then where do we stand?
'Cause I'm still confused.

19:54.393 --> 19:55.994
{\an3}What I said

19:56.061 --> 19:58.063
is that (bleep)
has to change

19:58.130 --> 20:00.232
{\an5}towards certain things.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.232
But she's asking you,
where do you stand?

20:00.299 --> 20:01.900
So do you want me to say,
yo, I love her?

20:01.967 --> 20:03.502
{\an1}(Bleep).
Yeah, I said it already.

20:03.569 --> 20:05.203
Do you want me to say
that we're together?

20:05.270 --> 20:07.639
No, we're not!

20:07.706 --> 20:09.942
All right, I know
there's a lot to talk about

20:10.008 --> 20:11.944
{\an5}and it sounds like
Moniece and Rich have
a lot to still discuss,

20:12.010 --> 20:13.545
but we have to take a break.

20:13.612 --> 20:15.414
When we return,
Miles and Milan

20:15.480 --> 20:17.215
brought their love
into the spotlight,

20:17.282 --> 20:19.351
but could their relationship
stand the heat?

20:19.418 --> 20:21.186
Find out next.

20:25.824 --> 20:27.693
{\an7}And you know he was
(bleep) up for that (bleep).

20:27.759 --> 20:29.695
{\an8}You're not a man,
you're not a black man.

20:29.761 --> 20:32.397
{\an8}My mother doesn't
even talk to me.

20:32.464 --> 20:35.400
{\an8}You know my sex was good,
so stop fronting that (bleep).

20:41.740 --> 20:43.175
{\an8}(cheering and applause)

20:43.241 --> 20:46.144
{\an8}Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood The Reunion."

20:46.211 --> 20:49.181
{\an8}Joining us on stage
are Miles,

20:49.247 --> 20:52.184
{\an8}Milan, and Amber.
Welcome, you guys.

20:52.250 --> 20:53.852
{\an8}(cheering and applause)

20:53.919 --> 20:57.089
{\an8}When we met Miles, he had
a place in Milan's heart

20:57.155 --> 20:59.124
{\an8}but was still
living in the closet.

20:59.191 --> 21:00.859
{\an8}Fed up with being
secret lovers,

21:00.926 --> 21:04.596
Milan wanted Miles to either
come out or get out of his life.

21:04.663 --> 21:06.131
Watch.

21:06.198 --> 21:09.234
Truth is I've been pushing
Amber away for a reason.

21:09.301 --> 21:10.702
{\an8}I fell in love
with somebody else.

21:12.404 --> 21:15.907
{\an8}What up, babe?

21:15.974 --> 21:19.478
{\an8}It's Milan.
I haven't told anybody
about our relationship.

21:19.544 --> 21:21.780
{\an8}(Milan)
In this hip-hop game,
image is everything

21:21.847 --> 21:23.215
{\an8}and you gotta play the part.

21:23.281 --> 21:25.450
{\an8}So the only place me and Miles
can go to without any suspicion

21:25.517 --> 21:26.451
{\an8}is to a strip club.

21:26.518 --> 21:27.719
{\an8}I'm tired of this (bleep).

21:27.786 --> 21:29.554
{\an7}I don't want to be
your (bleep) secret anymore

21:29.621 --> 21:31.289
{\an8}and you're not gonna
keep linger me on--

21:31.356 --> 21:33.358
{\an8}You're not my secret,
you're not my secret.

21:33.425 --> 21:35.327
{\an7}How am I not your--
how am I not a secret?

21:33.425 --> 21:35.327
{\an6}(Bleep).

21:35.394 --> 21:38.130
{\an8}I feel like he doesn't
understand me

21:38.196 --> 21:40.866
{\an8}and my side of things
and where I'm coming from,

21:40.932 --> 21:43.101
{\an8}when it's my family,
it's my religion.

21:43.168 --> 21:45.237
{\an8}Right, but his heart
is involved, Miles.

21:43.168 --> 21:45.237
{\an5}What do you do?

21:45.303 --> 21:47.873
{\an7}How do you still have respect
and be out in this game?

21:47.939 --> 21:49.274
{\an8}Let's get matching tattoos.

21:49.341 --> 21:51.176
{\an8}That's my stamp on you,
that's your stamp on me.

21:51.243 --> 21:52.511
{\an8}I already got it.

21:52.577 --> 21:54.413
{\an8}(Milan)
I cannot believe he did that.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.682
{\an8}I don't know who this person is,
but I'm loving it.

21:56.748 --> 21:59.051
{\an8}Listen, I don't have nothing
against this girl Amber.

21:59.117 --> 22:01.186
{\an8}But let's be clear,
she is his ex.

22:01.253 --> 22:02.587
{\an8}I'm gonna tell her when
I'm ready to tell her.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.256
{\an8}How about that?

22:02.654 --> 22:04.256
{\an8}It needs to be soon.

22:04.322 --> 22:05.957
{\an8}Or I'm gonna call her
and tell her myself.

22:06.024 --> 22:07.526
{\an8}(Miles)
I know Milan is right.

22:07.592 --> 22:09.928
{\an8}I do need to tell Amber
and I need to do it now,

22:09.995 --> 22:11.196
{\an8}while it's still
my decision,

22:11.263 --> 22:12.998
{\an8}before she hears it
from somebody else.

22:14.933 --> 22:18.103
(cheering and applause)

22:18.170 --> 22:20.572
So, Miles,
let me ask you.

22:20.639 --> 22:23.375
When you first met Milan, were
you instantly attracted to him?

22:23.442 --> 22:25.744
{\an1}Uh, yeah,
I was.

22:25.811 --> 22:27.112
{\an8}I was, definitely.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.181
{\an8}We met at, um,
at a club in Hollywood.

22:29.247 --> 22:32.517
And I seen him around
and I just kinda, like,

22:32.584 --> 22:35.120
finagled my way
into getting his number.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.022
{\an5}You know, things
just went from there.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.022
(Nina) Okay.

22:37.089 --> 22:39.691
Milan, now, I know that
it was a struggle for you

22:39.758 --> 22:42.728
because you guys were together
for almost two years.

22:42.794 --> 22:44.963
{\an5}Two-and-a-half years.

22:42.794 --> 22:44.963
For almost two-and-a-half years.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.032
{\an1}And you had to
basically hide it.

22:47.099 --> 22:49.434
{\an1}How difficult
was that at times?

22:49.501 --> 22:52.337
{\an1}You know, it's hard to be
in love with someone and be--

22:52.404 --> 22:54.673
{\an1}only time you see him is in
your house or in your bedroom

22:54.740 --> 22:56.041
and then they leave.

22:56.108 --> 22:58.076
{\an8}You don't get
anything else out of--

22:58.143 --> 22:59.511
{\an8}but watching a movie and sex.

22:59.578 --> 23:01.113
{\an8}You know,
that's not a relationship.

23:01.179 --> 23:03.982
And I don't think it was fair to
be in that position for so long.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.518
{\an5}Amber, let me
ask you a question.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.518
Yes.

23:06.585 --> 23:08.754
Were you ever
concerned before

23:08.820 --> 23:10.622
{\an8}about this friendship
with Milan?

23:10.689 --> 23:12.224
{\an8}Absolutely not.

23:12.290 --> 23:13.458
{\an8}You weren't.

23:12.290 --> 23:13.458
{\an8}No.

23:13.525 --> 23:14.793
All right.

23:14.860 --> 23:17.295
Miles boldly brought his truth
out into the daylight

23:17.362 --> 23:19.531
when he came out to Amber
and his family,

23:19.598 --> 23:21.867
but unfortunately,
the way they reacted

23:21.933 --> 23:24.402
is exactly why he kept
his secret in the dark.

23:24.469 --> 23:25.804
Watch.

23:25.871 --> 23:28.373
I just have to
figure things out.

23:28.440 --> 23:31.943
{\an8}Um, I've had...

23:34.045 --> 23:38.416
{\an8}feelings of attraction
towards the same sex.

23:42.287 --> 23:45.023
{\an8}And I've been
in a relationship.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.828
{\an8}(Amber sobbing)

23:52.297 --> 23:55.133
{\an8}I have to go
to the bathroom.

23:52.297 --> 23:55.133
{\an5}Everybody was right!

23:55.200 --> 23:57.202
{\an7}Miles?

23:55.200 --> 23:57.202
{\an8}No!

23:57.269 --> 24:01.039
{\an8}I want to call my mom!

24:01.106 --> 24:04.109
{\an7}Look at-- She's in pain,
so you need to go be there.

24:04.176 --> 24:05.577
{\an8}Leave me alone!

24:05.644 --> 24:07.112
{\an8}Leave me alone, then!

24:07.179 --> 24:09.114
{\an8}Amber.

24:07.179 --> 24:09.114
{\an8}I'm telling everybody.

24:09.181 --> 24:10.649
{\an8}I'm telling everybody
that you did this.

24:10.715 --> 24:12.617
{\an8}I'm telling my mom,
I'm telling everybody.

24:12.684 --> 24:14.653
{\an8}Leave me alone!

24:14.719 --> 24:18.423
{\an8}Recently, I've been
dating a guy.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.726
{\an8}But you sleep with men.

24:21.793 --> 24:25.063
{\an8}I have.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.098
{\an8}We have morals.

24:27.165 --> 24:29.334
{\an8}So what, you just
saying (bleep) God?

24:29.401 --> 24:32.103
{\an8}Is that what you saying?

24:29.401 --> 24:32.103
{\an8}Not at all.

24:32.170 --> 24:33.905
{\an8}We are your family.

24:33.972 --> 24:37.342
{\an7}We don't want to see our little
brother going down a path.

24:37.409 --> 24:39.945
{\an8}We want nieces and nephews.

24:40.011 --> 24:41.613
{\an8}We want to see you
with a wife.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.515
{\an8}Make better decisions, Miles.

24:43.582 --> 24:46.685
{\an8}Telling you guys is the hardest
thing I've ever done in my life.

24:46.751 --> 24:49.287
{\an8}(cheering and applause)

24:49.354 --> 24:51.756
{\an5}(Nina)
Now, please
welcome to the show,

24:51.823 --> 24:56.027
Miles' sister Charmagne
and Amber's sister Angel.

24:57.529 --> 25:00.098
Now, I know this is very
emotional for all of you.

25:00.165 --> 25:03.301
Amber, you had a very raw

25:03.368 --> 25:07.005
and emotional reaction
to Miles coming out to you.

25:07.072 --> 25:09.975
How did it make you feel
to re-watch that?

25:10.041 --> 25:12.844
Well...

25:14.946 --> 25:16.781
it does hurt me

25:16.848 --> 25:20.118
to watch that replay,
you know?

25:20.185 --> 25:22.520
Because I know how bad
I hurt that day.

25:22.587 --> 25:24.422
You know,
I felt embarrassed.

25:24.489 --> 25:27.192
You know, I felt like--
I felt like (bleep).

25:27.259 --> 25:30.295
{\an1}And it really hurt me
because, like,

25:30.362 --> 25:33.531
{\an1}not only were you with me
for 10 years plus,

25:33.598 --> 25:36.534
{\an1}you know,
you're my best friend.

25:36.601 --> 25:40.238
You cannot come and tell me
something so-- so deep?

25:40.305 --> 25:41.873
So I felt super played.

25:41.940 --> 25:44.309
Then I just start thinking
about, like, my daughter Zoe,

25:44.376 --> 25:47.445
like why would you do
that for her?

25:47.512 --> 25:49.681
Like...

25:49.748 --> 25:52.517
(Miles)
I'm sorry.

25:52.584 --> 25:54.519
I apologize.

25:54.586 --> 25:56.288
What really put the nail
in the coffin for you?

25:56.354 --> 25:59.357
The fact that he was admitting
to being attracted to men?

25:59.424 --> 26:02.527
Or was it that he was already
in another relationship?

26:05.263 --> 26:06.898
I'll give you a minute.

26:08.333 --> 26:09.734
'Cause I said I wasn't
gonna cry today.

26:09.801 --> 26:12.203
{\an1}And I'm not gonna cry
no more over him.

26:12.270 --> 26:14.572
{\an5}(scattered applause)

26:12.270 --> 26:14.572
Yep.

26:14.639 --> 26:18.009
Um, so...

26:18.076 --> 26:21.046
Okay, it wasn't the fact
that he was gay,

26:21.112 --> 26:23.381
but it was the fact

26:23.448 --> 26:26.084
that he lied to me
about being gay.

26:26.151 --> 26:28.186
And I would never
sit up here, ever,

26:28.253 --> 26:30.989
{\an1}and like, and ever down
him for that (bleep)

26:31.056 --> 26:34.159
{\an4}and look down on him
or talk about him because
of that (bleep).

26:34.225 --> 26:35.460
Never.

26:35.527 --> 26:38.663
{\an1}But how he played me,
that's where he (bleep) up.

26:38.730 --> 26:40.932
{\an1}And he know he was
(bleep) up for that (bleep).

26:40.999 --> 26:44.002
{\an8}Also with her having her
daughter in his life--

26:44.069 --> 26:45.603
{\an8}I got a 12-year-old
daughter!

26:45.670 --> 26:48.273
I have a baby that looks
at this man like a daddy!

26:48.340 --> 26:49.841
My baby daddy got murdered!

26:49.908 --> 26:51.509
And ever since then,
Miles been there for her,

26:51.576 --> 26:53.078
so don't nobody
(bleep) with me.

26:53.144 --> 26:55.213
Nobody-- nobody say nothing.

26:55.280 --> 26:58.516
Nobody.

26:58.583 --> 26:59.918
I'm sorry.

26:59.985 --> 27:01.353
I didn't know
how to tell you.

27:01.419 --> 27:02.954
{\an1}No, and I know that,
I know that.

27:03.021 --> 27:05.724
{\an5}I know that.

27:03.021 --> 27:05.724
I didn't-- I was still
dealing with it myself.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.092
My family didn't know.

27:07.158 --> 27:09.027
I know we're best friends,
but you're not a man,

27:09.094 --> 27:10.328
you're not a black man,

27:10.395 --> 27:12.030
you don't have all these
straight homeboys

27:12.097 --> 27:13.865
{\an5}and you're not a rapper.

27:12.097 --> 27:13.865
And I get that.

27:13.932 --> 27:15.333
Because it takes
a lot of courage.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.936
It takes a lot of courage
to do what you did, a lot.

27:18.003 --> 27:19.371
I give that to you.

27:19.437 --> 27:21.072
{\an1}But I'm not gonna
sugarcoat it

27:21.139 --> 27:22.941
{\an1}and pat you on the back
for sitting there

27:23.008 --> 27:24.709
and not telling me (bleep).

27:24.776 --> 27:25.977
I don't give a (bleep).

27:26.044 --> 27:27.712
{\an5}(Nina)
Milan, based on
your experience,

27:27.779 --> 27:29.214
could you understand
why it was so difficult

27:29.280 --> 27:31.649
{\an5}for Miles to come out?

27:29.280 --> 27:31.649
Absolutely, absolutely.

27:31.716 --> 27:34.219
Of course, it's gonna-- it's
hard for anybody to come out.

27:34.285 --> 27:37.789
You know, that's a difficult
thing in life to tell anyone--

27:37.856 --> 27:40.191
your family,
your friends, and we--

27:40.258 --> 27:42.027
The majority of these people
in our audience

27:42.093 --> 27:44.763
are African-American descent
or a minority descent,

27:44.829 --> 27:47.298
and in our culture,
being gay is a derogatory

27:47.365 --> 27:49.267
and it's a defamation
of a character.

27:49.334 --> 27:51.936
My mother doesn't
even talk to me.

27:52.003 --> 27:54.839
{\an1}Right. You're saying,
for the situation--

27:54.906 --> 27:56.741
Just in general,
for anybody that's gay,

27:56.808 --> 27:58.777
we have to go through
too much (bleep) for nothing,

27:58.843 --> 28:00.812
for being who we are,
who we were born.

28:00.879 --> 28:02.714
It's-- it's not right.

28:02.781 --> 28:04.449
(applause)

28:04.516 --> 28:07.886
{\an4}(Charmagne)
I understand Amber, Amber's
like a little sister to me.

28:07.952 --> 28:10.455
{\an8}But at the same time,
I understand Miles,

28:10.522 --> 28:12.290
because it's
a touchy subject.

28:12.357 --> 28:13.825
{\an5}(Angel)
Let's think about the woman
in this situation.

28:13.892 --> 28:15.827
{\an5}(Teairra) To accept it.

28:13.892 --> 28:15.827
Who nobody-- Yeah.

28:15.894 --> 28:17.896
{\an1}Who nobody has acknowledged
through this whole thing?

28:17.962 --> 28:19.764
{\an8}I have, I have.

28:17.962 --> 28:19.764
{\an7}She's gone through
a lot of pain.

28:19.831 --> 28:20.899
{\an7}No, but a lot of people
bash her, too.

28:20.965 --> 28:22.434
Now, Angel, let me ask you.

28:22.500 --> 28:25.370
Miles was close with your
family for very many years.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.872
{\an5}He's still close.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.872
Will that continue?

28:27.939 --> 28:29.441
Will you guys continue
to love and support him?

28:29.507 --> 28:31.609
{\an1}We accept Miles, you know,
we call you family.

28:31.676 --> 28:33.778
{\an1}If we go through a rough patch,
we go through it.

28:33.845 --> 28:35.713
{\an1}After the rough patch,
we still love you.

28:35.780 --> 28:39.317
{\an5}I love to see that
there's still a lot of
love and strong bonds here.

28:39.384 --> 28:43.054
{\an5}Now, Miles, do you feel
like you would have handled
anything differently?

28:43.121 --> 28:44.956
I know he deserved
for me to tell her,

28:45.023 --> 28:47.659
she deserved to know,
and I owed it to myself, so...

28:47.725 --> 28:49.160
I just did the best
that I could.

28:49.227 --> 28:50.829
There's no manual to this,
you know?

28:50.895 --> 28:52.664
You did amazing, baby.

28:52.730 --> 28:56.034
You did amazing,
you did amazing, yes.

28:56.101 --> 28:59.237
Coming up, are Max and Brandi's
rings on their fingers?

28:59.304 --> 29:01.573
Or chilling somewhere
in the neighbor's bushes?

29:01.639 --> 29:05.210
Find out when "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood The Reunion" returns.

29:05.276 --> 29:07.045
(cheering and applause)

29:08.313 --> 29:10.281
{\an8}Why does she think
you're a bad influence?

29:10.348 --> 29:12.016
{\an8}I'm sorry.
Don't defend these hoes.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.017
{\an8}(audience oohing)

29:13.084 --> 29:14.652
{\an8}Why are you talking to me?

29:14.719 --> 29:16.354
{\an8}I don't want to hear
anything that she has to say.

29:24.863 --> 29:26.764
(cheering and applause)

29:31.202 --> 29:33.938
{\an8}Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood The Reunion."

29:34.005 --> 29:37.008
This season, we met
Brandi and Max Lux,

29:37.075 --> 29:39.344
whose marriage began
to falter for two reasons--

29:39.410 --> 29:42.480
Max wasn't always
wearing his wedding ring

29:42.547 --> 29:45.783
and Brandi was always
wearing her crazy.

29:45.850 --> 29:46.985
Take a look.

29:47.051 --> 29:48.887
{\an8}Hey, babe.
What are you doing?

29:48.953 --> 29:50.488
{\an8}Getting ready to hit the stu'.

29:50.555 --> 29:52.157
{\an8}You're missing something.

29:52.223 --> 29:54.425
{\an8}What?

29:52.223 --> 29:54.425
{\an9}Your ring.

29:54.492 --> 29:56.794
{\an8}Oh, yeah, I got my ring, too.

29:56.861 --> 29:58.263
{\an8}Bing.

29:58.329 --> 30:00.899
{\an7}Bitch, get your mother(bleep)
arm off my husband.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.233
{\an8}Oh, you didn't know?

30:00.965 --> 30:02.233
{\an8}Babe, babe...

30:02.300 --> 30:03.635
{\an8}You didn't know he was married?

30:03.701 --> 30:05.336
{\an7}You wanna know why you don't
know he's (bleep) married?

30:05.403 --> 30:06.804
{\an8}You wanna know why?

30:05.403 --> 30:06.804
{\an8}(Ray J)
Hold on, wait, wait, wait!

30:06.871 --> 30:09.307
{\an8}This is why the bitch doesn't
know you're (bleep) married!

30:09.374 --> 30:10.542
{\an8}Why don't you wear your ring?

30:10.608 --> 30:12.477
{\an8}Listen, listen...

30:10.608 --> 30:12.477
{\an8}I'm not listening!

30:12.544 --> 30:13.978
{\an8}You answer the question!

30:12.544 --> 30:13.978
{\an8}All right.

30:14.045 --> 30:15.213
{\an8}Let me tell you something.

30:15.280 --> 30:16.381
{\an7}Since you care about
this ring so much.

30:15.280 --> 30:16.381
{\an6}Mm-hmm.

30:16.447 --> 30:18.183
{\an8}You can have it.

30:18.249 --> 30:19.484
{\an8}100.

30:19.551 --> 30:22.153
{\an8}Max, don't do that!

30:22.220 --> 30:24.289
{\an8}Get that--
go get that ring.

30:24.355 --> 30:27.192
{\an7}I swear to God, if you get in
that car and drive off, I--

30:36.100 --> 30:39.470
{\an8}(Nina)
All right, Brandi,
okay, I have to ask you,

30:39.537 --> 30:42.307
{\an8}what did you think
you were gonna do jumping
in front of that big SUV?

30:42.373 --> 30:44.242
{\an8}I was so angry,

30:44.309 --> 30:47.645
{\an8}I didn't have my--
my best mind state on,

30:47.712 --> 30:50.348
to realize, bitch,
what is you thinking?

30:50.415 --> 30:51.983
He's gonna reverse
on your ass.

30:52.050 --> 30:53.651
He know he's so lucky.

30:53.718 --> 30:55.820
Because, honey, if I would
have had some shorts on,

30:55.887 --> 30:58.289
I would have been all up on
the top of that damn car.

30:58.356 --> 30:59.624
{\an5}(Nina)
I was gonna say, I don't
put it past you to drive--

30:59.691 --> 31:01.025
{\an5}ride on top of the car.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.025
Yes.

31:01.092 --> 31:03.494
Girl, I would have been the
Incredible Hulk up in that mug.

31:03.561 --> 31:04.963
She definitely been on the top
of the Bentley before.

31:05.029 --> 31:06.698
No shame, but a girl gotta do
what they gotta do sometimes.

31:06.764 --> 31:08.800
(Nina)
Let me ask you this.

31:08.866 --> 31:10.435
Do you regret
not wearing your ring?

31:10.501 --> 31:13.071
{\an8}I understand why I did it,
but I regret it for her,

31:13.137 --> 31:15.039
{\an8}because it's disrespectful
to her.

31:13.137 --> 31:15.039
{\an5}Okay.

31:15.106 --> 31:16.541
You know, when you
in a relationship,

31:16.608 --> 31:18.743
you do (bleep) that bothers
people when they bother you.

31:18.810 --> 31:22.080
{\an5}Now, Shanda, I know
that you're married,
you guys are both married.

31:22.146 --> 31:24.616
So would you react the same way
if he threw your ring?

31:24.682 --> 31:26.851
Well, we don't normally
wear our rings,

31:26.918 --> 31:29.787
{\an5}so you know, it doesn't-- I
don't think a ring, you know...

31:26.918 --> 31:29.787
I'm the only--

31:29.854 --> 31:32.490
(laughter)

31:32.557 --> 31:34.459
A ring means nothing.
You can have a ring on.

31:34.525 --> 31:36.527
They gravitate
to a man with rings.

31:36.594 --> 31:39.931
You're right, the females
gravitate quickly to the rings,

31:39.998 --> 31:43.067
but, bitch, don't tell me you
didn't know, 'cause you know.

31:43.134 --> 31:46.337
So when you gravitate
and you prepare to gravitate,

31:46.404 --> 31:50.441
{\an5}be prepared to get
what comes to gravitation,
when your ass...

31:52.110 --> 31:55.046
(Nina)
That's fair. That's fair.

31:55.113 --> 31:58.383
{\an8}Every girl in the studio, that
be in the studio, ain't a ho.

31:58.449 --> 32:00.184
I'm sorry,
don't defend these hoes.

32:00.251 --> 32:01.953
Brandi has said
that she gets nervous

32:02.020 --> 32:04.389
when Max is in
the studio with you.

32:04.455 --> 32:06.124
Why does she think
you're a bad influence?

32:06.190 --> 32:08.192
{\an5}'Cause he is.

32:06.190 --> 32:08.192
(audience oohing)

32:10.928 --> 32:12.964
(laughter)

32:13.031 --> 32:14.732
{\an5}(Nina) Brandi, let me
ask you a question.

32:13.031 --> 32:14.732
Yes, Nina.

32:14.799 --> 32:16.601
Do you have any tips
for Princess

32:16.668 --> 32:17.802
if she's gonna ever pop up?

32:17.869 --> 32:19.737
Do you have any tips of
camouflage or anything?

32:19.804 --> 32:21.406
{\an5}(Ray J) Princess don't pop up.

32:19.804 --> 32:21.406
Princess don't pop up,

32:21.472 --> 32:23.574
but she know if she ever--
ever gets that thought,

32:23.641 --> 32:26.644
I'm the first person
you call.

32:26.711 --> 32:28.746
'Cause ain't nobody do it better
than me when it comes...

32:28.813 --> 32:30.848
(laughter)

32:33.117 --> 32:34.652
They want to give a kiss
to each other,

32:34.719 --> 32:36.554
Max Lux and Little Brandi,
a real kiss.

32:36.621 --> 32:38.022
Oh, my God.
Let me take my hat off.

32:38.089 --> 32:40.992
{\an5}(audience awwing)

32:38.089 --> 32:40.992
And y'all got the rings on!

32:41.059 --> 32:44.495
Rings gonna change today.

32:44.562 --> 32:46.230
Love is in the building,
now, coming up,

32:46.297 --> 32:50.001
Fizz took a bite of
both Kamiah and Nikki.

32:50.068 --> 32:52.370
Is bringing them together
a recipe for disaster?

32:52.437 --> 32:55.873
We'll see when "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood The Reunion" returns.

32:55.940 --> 32:57.842
(cheering and applause)

33:00.845 --> 33:04.849
{\an8}Do you think it's disrespectful
to refer to women as appetizers?

33:04.916 --> 33:07.018
{\an8}(audience awwing)

33:04.916 --> 33:07.018
{\an8}Aww, Nikki.

33:08.386 --> 33:10.655
{\an8}I'm a good mom!
You can learn something.

33:10.722 --> 33:12.557
{\an8}Who you talking to?

33:10.722 --> 33:12.557
{\an8}(overlapping shouting)

33:20.365 --> 33:22.633
(cheering and applause)

33:22.700 --> 33:25.837
{\an5}(Nina) Welcome back to part one
of "Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood
The Reunion."

33:25.903 --> 33:28.740
{\an8}I'm Nina Parker
and join me in welcoming

33:28.806 --> 33:31.642
{\an8}Fizz, Kamiah,
and Nikki to the stage.

33:31.709 --> 33:34.979
{\an5}Miss Nikki Baby.

33:31.709 --> 33:34.979
Miss Nikki Baby, okay.

33:35.046 --> 33:38.616
Now, it's time to talk about
Fizz' hunger for the ladies.

33:38.683 --> 33:41.486
Now, he initially chose
Kamiah as his appetizer.

33:41.552 --> 33:44.455
{\an5}Creep Squad!

33:41.552 --> 33:44.455
But when he got
a taste of Nikki,

33:44.522 --> 33:46.758
he made her his main course.

33:46.824 --> 33:48.493
Let's have a look.

33:48.559 --> 33:51.095
{\an5}(Fizz)
Kamiah is a model that I've been
dating, nothing too serious.

33:51.162 --> 33:53.965
This weekend, I was out of town,
so I left her my key

33:54.031 --> 33:56.234
so she could crash at my pad
for a few days.

33:56.300 --> 33:57.635
Yo, what the (bleep)?

33:57.702 --> 33:59.871
{\an8}I left Kamiah my key
and I come back home

33:59.937 --> 34:02.273
{\an8}to a completely different crib
than the one I left.

34:02.340 --> 34:03.741
{\an8}I don't know
where Kamiah is at,

34:03.808 --> 34:06.944
{\an8}but her moving her stuff
in was not in my game book.

34:07.011 --> 34:08.946
{\an7}You been to a restaurant,
you get those, like...

34:09.013 --> 34:10.848
{\an7}that one appetizer you like,
and then you got, like,

34:10.915 --> 34:12.817
{\an8}a main course that
you stick to, too?

34:12.884 --> 34:14.518
{\an8}You're referring to me as the
appetizer or the main course?

34:14.585 --> 34:16.254
{\an8}No, I'm saying, I'm not
ready for my main course

34:16.320 --> 34:18.523
{\an8}and I'm having appetizers
right now, I'm sampling.

34:18.589 --> 34:19.556
{\an8}You're being disrespectful
about it is my thing.

34:19.623 --> 34:21.192
{\an8}I'm not being disrespectful.

34:19.623 --> 34:21.192
{\an9}You are.

34:21.259 --> 34:23.828
{\an7}If you want to sit here and date
me while I'm dating around,

34:23.895 --> 34:26.898
{\an8}then that's up to you.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.898
{\an8}And I'm making
the decision not to.

34:26.964 --> 34:30.001
{\an8}So you're off the menu?

34:26.964 --> 34:30.001
{\an8}I'm not an appetizer,
I'll tell you that.

34:30.067 --> 34:33.670
{\an8}So you're not with Fizz anymore?

34:30.067 --> 34:33.670
{\an8}He compared me to an appetizer.

34:33.737 --> 34:35.907
{\an7}And I'm just looking at him
like, (bleep), what?

34:35.973 --> 34:40.178
{\an8}How was the sex?

34:35.973 --> 34:40.178
{\an7}When he was able to get it up,
it was... it was decent.

34:40.244 --> 34:44.916
{\an7}Kamiah actually said
the sex wasn't all that.

34:40.244 --> 34:44.916
{\an6}Really?

34:44.982 --> 34:47.351
{\an8}Because after the first time,
her legs were shaking

34:47.418 --> 34:50.121
{\an8}and the girl wouldn't even
get out of bed talking about,
"It was too good."

34:50.188 --> 34:53.024
{\an8}What's up with your little
situation with, you know,
Miss Kamiah?

34:53.090 --> 34:54.358
{\an8}That's done already.

34:54.425 --> 34:56.060
{\an7}I just really gotta
get her stuff out my house.

34:56.127 --> 34:58.596
{\an8}I made you a gift to take
to the next man's house.

34:58.663 --> 35:00.631
{\an7}Oh, really?
This is what you made me--

35:00.698 --> 35:02.467
{\an8}Take it to your house.

35:00.698 --> 35:02.467
{\an8}Hold up, hold up.

35:02.533 --> 35:04.135
{\an8}You need to get your--

35:04.202 --> 35:05.269
{\an8}I'm not taking it
to no man's house.

35:04.202 --> 35:05.269
{\an5}Don't touch me.

35:05.336 --> 35:07.004
{\an8}No, you need to go.

35:05.336 --> 35:07.004
{\an8}Don't (bleep) touch me.

35:07.071 --> 35:08.739
{\an8}Get up out of here.

35:07.071 --> 35:08.739
{\an8}You're not gonna touch me.

35:08.806 --> 35:10.775
{\an8}You're not gonna touch me!

35:08.806 --> 35:10.775
{\an8}Get up out of here,
stupid-ass (bleep).

35:10.842 --> 35:13.144
{\an8}Stupid-ass (bleep).

35:10.842 --> 35:13.144
{\an8}Nikki can get some more surgery.

35:13.211 --> 35:15.480
{\an8}She needs it,
ugly-ass bitch.

35:15.546 --> 35:17.548
{\an8}(cheering and applause)

35:17.615 --> 35:20.284
I'm a pretty-ass bitch,
but, okay.

35:22.653 --> 35:24.722
All right, Fizz,
I have to start with you.

35:24.789 --> 35:29.293
Do you think it's disrespectful
to refer to women as appetizers?

35:29.360 --> 35:31.662
{\an8}That's not what I was
referring to her as, per--

35:31.729 --> 35:33.130
{\an5}Not like-- like--

35:31.729 --> 35:33.130
Aww.

35:33.197 --> 35:35.766
I was just trying to give her
a metaphor as to what it was,

35:35.833 --> 35:38.035
{\an7}because I felt like
she knew what it was.

35:35.833 --> 35:38.035
{\an5}It was a horrible metaphor.

35:38.102 --> 35:40.438
But I do want to
sincerely apologize

35:40.505 --> 35:43.040
{\an4}if you took it that way,
you know, for calling
you an appetizer,

35:43.107 --> 35:44.842
{\an4}'cause if I had a daughter,
that's the last thing
I would want,

35:44.909 --> 35:48.412
{\an5}her to be on any menu.

35:44.909 --> 35:48.412
All right, I appreciate that.

35:48.479 --> 35:51.148
Nikki, did that--
did that concept bother you?

35:51.215 --> 35:53.217
It's a metaphor,
like, I'm a rapper--

35:53.284 --> 35:55.453
{\an5}Hello, we're talking to Nikki.

35:53.284 --> 35:55.453
Like when does that get
misconstrued, you feel me?

35:55.520 --> 35:57.021
Wait a minute.

35:57.088 --> 35:58.489
But flip it, though.

35:58.556 --> 35:59.891
I mean, I understand you guys
are in a different situation,

35:59.957 --> 36:01.459
but if the roles
were reversed--

36:01.526 --> 36:04.095
{\an8}Yeah, it is rude, for sure,
for sure, 'cause we're not food.

36:04.161 --> 36:05.730
{\an8}We-- we're real people,
you know what I'm saying?

36:05.796 --> 36:07.398
{\an5}Like, it is rude.

36:05.796 --> 36:07.398
(Nina) All right.

36:07.465 --> 36:09.200
Now, I want to get to you,
Kamiah, a little bit.

36:09.267 --> 36:10.835
Now, how long did
you and Fizz date?

36:10.902 --> 36:13.638
{\an5}Um, not long.
It was short.

36:10.902 --> 36:13.638
Very short? Okay.

36:13.704 --> 36:16.674
{\an5}You said that she misinterpreted
the relationship stuff.

36:13.704 --> 36:16.674
Right.

36:16.741 --> 36:19.744
{\an1}Um, well, like, you know,
I'm a really nice dude

36:19.810 --> 36:22.413
and through conversation
that me and her had,

36:22.480 --> 36:24.682
you know, she was going
through some things at home,

36:24.749 --> 36:28.152
so on my time away from home,
being out of state,

36:28.219 --> 36:31.956
{\an5}doing what I was doing,
I offered my house to her.

36:28.219 --> 36:31.956
{\an3}Okay.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.958
{\an5}To be able to get away
from the madness that
she was going through.

36:34.025 --> 36:36.360
So you're saying, it was--
you were offering her home,

36:36.427 --> 36:38.362
not as a relationship,
but as more of a safety house

36:38.429 --> 36:39.897
{\an5}for her while she was going
through something.

36:38.429 --> 36:39.897
Exactly. Absolutely.

36:39.964 --> 36:41.265
Is that true?

36:41.332 --> 36:44.969
Um, I think it was a little bit
misunderstood, obviously.

36:45.036 --> 36:47.171
{\an5}Um...

36:45.036 --> 36:47.171
And you know my sex was good,

36:47.238 --> 36:49.907
{\an5}so stop fronting
on that (bleep).

36:47.238 --> 36:49.907
I'm not speaking on that.

36:49.974 --> 36:51.809
{\an5}You won't speak on that?

36:49.974 --> 36:51.809
I'm not speaking on that.

36:51.876 --> 36:54.412
{\an5}Okay.

36:51.876 --> 36:54.412
Don't front on that.

36:54.478 --> 36:57.048
{\an1}And you know what, I just want
to say, first and foremost,

36:57.114 --> 36:59.283
in me taking to
Jason Lee about that,

36:59.350 --> 37:00.818
it was not the time
and the place

37:00.885 --> 37:03.054
{\an1}and I'm woman enough to say
that and I apologize for that.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.655
{\an5}Is that good enough for you?

37:03.120 --> 37:04.655
I'll leave it at that.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.557
My (bleep) good.

37:06.624 --> 37:08.092
(laughter)

37:08.159 --> 37:11.562
Where do you guys stand now
with your dating situation?

37:11.629 --> 37:15.166
We're still dating. You know,
I lost my brother this year.

37:15.232 --> 37:16.667
{\an1}I've been through a lot
of stuff, and I told him,

37:16.734 --> 37:18.069
{\an1}I was very open
with him about that.

37:18.135 --> 37:20.871
{\an1}So I couldn't invest
my feelings into a man

37:20.938 --> 37:24.842
because I went through a lot
in my life and he knew that.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.510
{\an5}(Brandi)
It's okay, Nikki.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.510
Aww, Nikki.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.813
It's okay, Nikki.

37:28.879 --> 37:32.183
{\an5}(Brandi) Oh, my God.

37:28.879 --> 37:32.183
(Fizz) Relax, man.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.818
{\an5}(Nina)
She's a little upset
about her brother right now,

37:33.884 --> 37:37.221
she's just having a moment.

37:37.288 --> 37:39.357
{\an5}I know, I know, Brandi--

37:37.288 --> 37:39.357
I'm gonna come back.

37:39.423 --> 37:41.559
{\an5}Let me go, let me go back.

37:39.423 --> 37:41.559
Okay, you know I love you.

37:41.626 --> 37:44.261
{\an5}(Nina)
I think she's upset,
give her a minute.

37:44.328 --> 37:46.097
{\an5}I swear to God...

37:44.328 --> 37:46.097
(Nina) All right.

37:46.163 --> 37:47.798
Okay, Nikki needed a moment.

37:47.865 --> 37:48.833
We're gonna take a break.

37:48.899 --> 37:50.635
There's much more
to talk about,

37:50.701 --> 37:51.869
so keep it locked
right here.

37:51.936 --> 37:54.205
It's "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood The Reunion."

37:54.271 --> 37:56.173
(cheering and applause)

37:57.475 --> 38:00.011
{\an8}All they got is you.

37:57.475 --> 38:00.011
{\an8}Why are you talking to me?

38:00.077 --> 38:01.512
{\an8}Why are you talking to me?

38:01.579 --> 38:03.781
{\an8}Because I'm a mother!

38:01.579 --> 38:03.781
{\an8}You're not my son's mother!

38:03.848 --> 38:06.617
{\an8}Bitch, you are not
my child's mother!

38:13.357 --> 38:15.259
(cheering and applause)

38:17.194 --> 38:20.398
{\an5}Welcome back to
part one of "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood The Reunion."

38:20.464 --> 38:23.467
{\an8}Fizz talked a lot this season
about his menu of ladies,

38:23.534 --> 38:25.436
{\an8}but another thing on his plate

38:25.503 --> 38:28.005
was being a full-time dad
to he and Moniece's son, Kam.

38:28.072 --> 38:29.674
Now, initially,
Fizz felt

38:29.740 --> 38:31.308
Moniece wasn't
pulling her own weight,

38:31.375 --> 38:33.911
but once he realized
how much her mom Marla

38:33.978 --> 38:35.546
was weighing on her,

38:35.613 --> 38:37.515
he was there
to lighten the load.

38:37.581 --> 38:40.251
{\an5}(Marla)
Moniece's priorities
are out of line.

38:40.317 --> 38:43.454
Moniece has go to
hone it in, bring it in,

38:43.521 --> 38:45.056
and make Kameron
her priority.

38:45.122 --> 38:47.591
{\an8}Get your ass
into the courtroom,

38:47.658 --> 38:49.126
{\an8}get full custody.

38:49.193 --> 38:51.328
{\an7}I'm not trying to take
Kameron away from his mom.

38:51.395 --> 38:54.065
{\an7}And to be sitting here
trying to help her

38:54.131 --> 38:56.333
{\an7}(bleep) get into
my son's life,

38:56.400 --> 38:58.202
{\an8}that (bleep) hurts, man.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.202
{\an9}I get you.

38:58.269 --> 39:00.404
{\an7}If you gonna be a parent
to Moniece, Marla,

39:00.471 --> 39:03.741
{\an8}I feel like you should support
her through her demise, period.

39:03.808 --> 39:05.443
{\an8}You have to understand this.

39:05.509 --> 39:06.877
{\an8}Like, seriously.

39:06.944 --> 39:10.281
{\an7}Your mom told me yesterday
to take you to court.

39:10.347 --> 39:13.117
{\an8}(Moniece)
I'd like to be able to say
that I can't believe

39:13.184 --> 39:14.552
{\an8}that my own mother
would tell Dreux

39:14.618 --> 39:17.455
{\an8}to take my son away from me,
but I do.

39:17.521 --> 39:19.657
{\an8}And hearing it yet again
makes me feel

39:19.724 --> 39:21.659
{\an8}like I'm always gonna be
fighting on my own.

39:26.797 --> 39:30.134
Now, Marla, you said that
Moniece does not prioritize Kam.

39:30.201 --> 39:33.537
{\an8}You have to force yourself
to make these little people

39:33.604 --> 39:35.773
{\an8}your first thing, always.

39:35.840 --> 39:38.075
{\an5}(Brandi)
Nothing ever comes
before your child.

39:38.142 --> 39:39.977
Nothing, nothing,
nothing, nothing.

39:40.044 --> 39:41.812
{\an1}Hold on.
And I'm not-- and I'm not--

39:41.879 --> 39:44.915
{\an5}I'm not talking about her,
I'm saying, in general.

39:41.879 --> 39:44.915
Me either, yes, yes.

39:44.982 --> 39:47.618
{\an1}And I'm speaking up
as a single mom, too.

39:47.685 --> 39:49.553
{\an8}You know,
when Kameron was born,

39:49.620 --> 39:51.789
{\an5}my parents weren't
gonna be getting up
in the middle of the night,

39:51.856 --> 39:53.290
{\an5}they weren't gonna be--

39:51.856 --> 39:53.290
They don't need to.

39:53.357 --> 39:54.992
Because they didn't
make the baby.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.794
{\an5}(Moniece)
They weren't gonna be putting
their dreams on hold.

39:56.861 --> 39:58.362
{\an5}This was my decision.

39:56.861 --> 39:58.362
Why would they do that?

39:58.429 --> 39:59.830
(Moniece)
So I was gonna deal with it.

39:59.897 --> 40:02.933
{\an5}(Shanda)
But you should, but you should!

39:59.897 --> 40:02.933
That's what mothers do.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.802
I don't want to hear anything
that she has to say.

40:04.869 --> 40:07.772
{\an1}Please don't make excuses ever
about being a mother.

40:07.838 --> 40:09.507
{\an4}To nobody.

40:07.838 --> 40:09.507
Cold day in hell,

40:09.573 --> 40:12.009
{\an1}I'll never put my child
second to nothing.

40:12.076 --> 40:14.278
{\an1}I don't care if
I'm struggling and broke.

40:14.345 --> 40:18.215
(overlapping shouting)

40:18.282 --> 40:21.318
{\an1}And I don't want any respect
or clapping, I choose my child.

40:21.385 --> 40:23.554
{\an5}All he got is you.

40:21.385 --> 40:23.554
He only has you guys.

40:23.621 --> 40:25.790
Why are you talking to me?
Why are you talking to me?

40:25.856 --> 40:27.291
{\an5}Because I'm a mother.

40:25.856 --> 40:27.291
Who you talking to?

40:27.358 --> 40:30.094
(overlapping shouting)

40:30.161 --> 40:31.729
(Bleep).

40:31.796 --> 40:34.198
(shouting continues)

40:34.265 --> 40:37.301
{\an5}(Bleep)!

40:34.265 --> 40:37.301
(Bleep)!
