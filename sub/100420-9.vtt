00:14.431 --> 00:16.141
<i>What is acting?</i>

00:17.100 --> 00:18.101
<i>Anyone?</i>

00:19.144 --> 00:20.437
<i>-Anyone?</i>

00:20.979 --> 00:26.484
Acting is about leaving everything behind,
and...

00:27.193 --> 00:30.113
And becoming something completely new.

00:30.238 --> 00:32.157
What is acting? Anyone?

00:32.240 --> 00:35.326
Acting is about
leaving everything behind, and...

00:36.953 --> 00:38.830
becoming something completely new.

00:45.253 --> 00:48.298
Becoming something completely new.

00:48.381 --> 00:49.466
Huh?

00:49.549 --> 00:51.009
Hey-o!

00:51.092 --> 00:53.845
Oh...

01:03.104 --> 01:04.647
What is acting?

01:05.023 --> 01:06.024
Anyone?

01:06.566 --> 01:07.609
Anyone?

01:07.776 --> 01:13.239
Acting is about leaving everything behind
and becoming something completely new.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.160
Nailed it.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.335
And that's a Sharpie.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.110
Good morning,
my name is Professor Horseman,

02:32.193 --> 02:33.987
which will remain
on that whiteboard forever,

02:34.070 --> 02:36.489
and this is Intermediate Scene Study.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.658
What is acting? Anyone?

02:38.741 --> 02:41.119
- Ooh!
-Oh! Okay. You.

02:41.202 --> 02:42.787
According to Stanislothski,

02:42.871 --> 02:45.415
acting is the desire
to create inside of oneself

02:45.498 --> 02:47.333
another, deeper, more interesting life

02:47.417 --> 02:49.419
than the one
that actually surrounds him...

02:49.502 --> 02:50.336
or her.

02:50.420 --> 02:53.214
-Oh, okay, yes, but also... Yes?
- Oh!

02:53.298 --> 02:57.051
Meisner would say, "Acting is behaving
truthfully under imaginary circumstances."

02:57.135 --> 03:00.054
Acting is behaving truthfully
under imaginary circumstances.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.932
Uh, okay, wow. So, that's acting.
But what is--?

03:03.016 --> 03:06.895
Guys, I'm concerned this class
is getting very theory-qua-theory...

03:06.978 --> 03:07.937
I was about to say that.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.232
...when technique should be a means
toward a more engaging art.

03:11.316 --> 03:14.319
-Well, quite astute.
-Sorry, horse professor. What's acting?

03:14.402 --> 03:15.278
Um...

03:15.904 --> 03:17.780
Acting is the, um...

03:18.698 --> 03:19.866
Acting is...

03:20.617 --> 03:21.534
Uh...

03:22.035 --> 03:25.997
I don't know what acting is.
I don't know what I'm doing.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.165
I shouldn't be here.

03:27.248 --> 03:28.958
- Wow.
- Oh!

03:29.626 --> 03:33.046
No, I don't want to quit.
I'm acting! That's acting.

03:33.129 --> 03:33.963
Oh!

03:34.047 --> 03:35.757
Class dismissed.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.801
But we still have
an hour and 20 minutes left.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.595
Yes. Again, I was acting.

03:40.678 --> 03:41.930
You sounded serious.

03:42.013 --> 03:45.016
Instead of judging my acting,
how about you act and I judge you?

03:45.350 --> 03:46.601
-For real?
-Yeah. Good point.

03:46.684 --> 03:49.187
We could show you the scenes
we were working on last semester.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.939
Uh, sure.

03:51.981 --> 03:54.567
-This is from "Kablammo, Mother."
-Whenever you're ready.

03:55.193 --> 03:59.405
Mama, where's Daddy's old World War II
grenade with the pin still in it?

03:59.489 --> 04:02.408
Why would you want
an old thing like that?

04:02.492 --> 04:07.413
Tonight, I intend to explode myself.
Where are the extra towels?

04:07.497 --> 04:08.957
-Okay, okay. Stop, stop.
-What?

04:09.040 --> 04:11.834
-Does this play take place in England?
- No.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.920
So why are you talking
with an English accent?

04:14.087 --> 04:15.129
I'm acting.

04:15.213 --> 04:18.758
Just as an exercise,
maybe use your normal voice.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.844
And Tawnie, when you're telling
your mother you're gonna kill yourself,

04:21.928 --> 04:24.389
the next line is,
"Where are the extra towels," right?

04:24.472 --> 04:26.057
And the character's being very casual,

04:26.140 --> 04:29.185
so maybe she should also be casual
when she says she's gonna kill herself.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.854
Like it's a big deal,
but it's not a big deal for her.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.149
-Like that's the irony of the scene.
-Whoa! That's really smart.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.944
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

04:38.152 --> 04:40.113
Okay, let's see it again.

04:40.655 --> 04:44.158
So, darling, what fun and games
shall we play?

04:44.242 --> 04:45.952
Shall we play Scattergories?

04:46.035 --> 04:48.371
I detest Scattergories!

04:48.454 --> 04:51.499
Whatever the prompt,
you always answer in vague allusions

04:51.582 --> 04:53.459
to the baby we never had!

04:53.543 --> 04:55.420
Stop. You're both talking to the audience.

04:55.503 --> 04:58.631
I want you to talk to each other,
you're having a conversation.

04:59.340 --> 05:03.011
-Hey! Who's you?
-Who's me? Screw you is who's me!

05:03.094 --> 05:06.514
I got the leads.
The Gooba Gooberry Falls leads.

05:06.597 --> 05:09.017
Mm! Them's them good leads.

05:09.100 --> 05:12.729
-Hubba hubba, I'm horny for leads!
-Okay, here's my question for you.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.064
Does your character
know he's horny for leads,

05:15.148 --> 05:17.025
or is he discovering it?

05:17.483 --> 05:19.610
Who's next? Great. What's the scene?

05:19.694 --> 05:21.738
The scene is I'm late for my next class.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.698
We were supposed to get out
20 minutes ago.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.616
Oh, shit. Sorry. See you Wednesday.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.744
Great work today. Way to go, team.

05:27.827 --> 05:30.747
We did it. That was great, huh?
How good was I?

05:36.753 --> 05:40.381
Whitfield, we've been here six weeks.
How do you think this is going?

05:40.465 --> 05:43.843
-I think I'm crushing it.
-Wow, okay. Well, I admire the confidence.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.887
I know you're an acting major.

05:45.970 --> 05:50.808
And I guess I just-- I wanted to make sure
that you're taking other classes.

05:50.892 --> 05:54.228
Like, Economics,
or maybe a plumbing course.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.147
Or rental car cashier class? I don't know.

05:56.230 --> 05:58.775
What would you want to do
if the acting thing doesn't work out?

05:58.858 --> 06:00.651
Hold up, do you think
I'm not a good actor?

06:00.735 --> 06:01.611
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:01.694 --> 06:05.114
You said "Not a good actor."
But now that you've said it...

06:05.198 --> 06:07.950
Some would say there are no bad actors,
only bad teachers.

06:08.034 --> 06:11.120
What about Jason Segel?
He was a bad actor in <i>Bad Teacher.</i>

06:11.204 --> 06:13.331
I am a wonderful actor.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.084
You'll see.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.668
-Okay.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.215
She knew I was drunk,

06:22.298 --> 06:24.634
but she still let me drive off
with Jonathan.

06:24.717 --> 06:27.095
Whoa, oh! I'm a drunk!

06:27.178 --> 06:28.679
Jesus, I had no idea, I--

06:28.763 --> 06:30.932
Booze has taken everything from me.

06:31.015 --> 06:34.185
-My job as an airline pilot, my wife.
-Huh? What the--?

06:34.268 --> 06:35.311
Those two things.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.146
Okay. I see what's happening.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.066
Sorry, everybody.
This is one of my acting students.

06:40.149 --> 06:42.110
-He's trying to, um--
-Who's Whitfield?

06:42.193 --> 06:45.196
-Nobody said "Whitfield."
-My name is Whip Whitaker.

06:45.279 --> 06:48.491
-Did you follow me here?
-I drank the vodka bottles on the plane.

06:48.574 --> 06:52.161
Drove the plane upside-downsy.
Yeah, I'm drunk now.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.287
-Wow.
-No, don't--

06:53.371 --> 06:54.539
We've all been there, man.

06:54.622 --> 06:57.333
He hasn't been there.
That's the plot of the movie <i>Flight.</i>

06:57.417 --> 06:59.043
Glug, glug, glug.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.337
-That wet the ol' whistle.
-So sorry, everyone.

07:01.421 --> 07:05.675
Now I'm completely over the 0.8 percent
blood alcohol level.

07:05.758 --> 07:08.428
-I'm in trouble. I am wasted.
-This is very disrespectful.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.972
-Hammered...
-We work hard to create a safe space here.

07:11.055 --> 07:13.766
-...tanked, blitzed...
-So sorry about that. I recognize that.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.561
-...Irish, canned, smashed...
-I value this room, just know that.

07:16.644 --> 07:19.772
-...annihilated, laced, faded.
-Really sorry about all of this.

07:19.856 --> 07:23.276
-So sorry.
-In conclusion, I am a drunk.

07:23.359 --> 07:25.987
The big D.

07:26.112 --> 07:30.575
-Fine. Shut up. You're a drunk.
-Aha! Wrong, I was acting!

07:30.700 --> 07:33.995
It appears the student
has become the student-er.

07:36.205 --> 07:38.166
Wow, an actor.

07:42.587 --> 07:45.006
-Uh...

07:50.011 --> 07:53.598
Foul! That fowl fouled, ref!
Where's the whistle?

07:53.764 --> 07:56.976
-Ugh!
-There are women tossing women everywhere!

07:57.059 --> 07:59.604
What is this, the Running of the Brides
at Filene's Basement?

07:59.687 --> 08:01.063
Who's with me?

08:03.483 --> 08:04.317
Okay.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.236
-Um, they're allowed to do that in rugby.
-What? Really?

08:07.320 --> 08:10.239
Also, nobody knows
what Filene's Basement is.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.575
That's a shame. You definitely paid
too much for that coat.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.744
-Oh, is it over? Did we win?

08:17.163 --> 08:19.874
Hey, you're really good.
I think.

08:19.957 --> 08:23.753
Don't feel like you have to come
to these things if it's not your thing.

08:23.836 --> 08:26.839
No, I liked it. Look at us. Doing college.

08:26.923 --> 08:31.677
I'm just saying you have your things
and I have my things. It's okay.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.804
-You wanna get something to eat?
-I-I can't.

08:33.888 --> 08:36.766
When we win,
we all go to Conspiracy to celebrate.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.560
-Sounds fun. Can I join you?
-I don't think you should.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.146
It's a bar,
and there will be alcohol there.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.856
-That's okay.
-And young girls.

08:43.940 --> 08:47.777
-What's that have to do with anything?
-Nothing. Just stating a fact.

08:48.402 --> 08:51.489
-Okay. Well, then, I guess I'll see you.
-Wouldn't wanna be you!

08:51.572 --> 08:53.616
But I would. You're cool.

08:54.492 --> 08:55.576
Thank you.

08:56.452 --> 08:57.411
Hmm.

09:01.499 --> 09:04.710
Yes, good. Keep doing what they're doing.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.213
Tawnie,
you're Hollyhock's best friend...

09:07.296 --> 09:09.423
-We're actually in a fight right now.
-Again?

09:09.507 --> 09:11.717
Our fights are like Adele songs.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.345
All kind of the same one,
but with different specifics.

09:14.428 --> 09:17.932
-Well, do you understand this rugby thing?
-Uh, honestly? No.

09:18.015 --> 09:21.435
She came back from winter break
super aggro, but that's Hollyhock, right?

09:21.519 --> 09:23.854
Suddenly, she decides,
"This is what I'm all about now,

09:23.938 --> 09:25.815
and everyone else
just has to get on board."

09:25.898 --> 09:27.441
What are we supposed to do with that?

09:27.525 --> 09:30.945
-Whoa!
-I guess... get on board.

09:32.863 --> 09:34.574
Get it out, get it-- Yes, nice.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.576
Nice run! Very nice!

09:36.659 --> 09:38.494
Touchdown! That's my sister!

09:38.578 --> 09:39.537
Good try!

09:39.620 --> 09:41.330
Try? She did it. She scored.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.790
It's called a try.

09:42.873 --> 09:44.625
Try to keep up.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.545
-Hey! Hey!

09:50.464 --> 09:51.382
-Yeah!
-Yes, Cardinals!

09:51.465 --> 09:52.967
-All right!
-All right!

09:57.096 --> 09:59.557
The two teams applaud each other,
and then the referees.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.559
As is customary. See footnote.

10:01.642 --> 10:02.977
We know.

10:03.728 --> 10:04.562
What's up, rugger?

10:04.645 --> 10:06.897
Two tries, two conversions,
and a drop goal?

10:06.981 --> 10:08.774
Jonah Lomu over here.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.860
-Great game, Hock.
-Oh, Hock.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.987
I like it.
Can I get a nickname too, Regina?

10:13.070 --> 10:16.198
How about, "Professor Horseman,
adult faculty member"?

10:16.282 --> 10:18.868
-We have to go.
-Yeah, go.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.370
Go. See you.
See you on the scrumming pitch.

10:22.371 --> 10:24.373
W-E-S-leyan!

10:24.457 --> 10:26.334
We will rock and maul and win!

10:26.417 --> 10:27.918
Wait. Where's Hollyhock?

10:28.002 --> 10:31.589
You mean Hollyhock
Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero...

10:34.342 --> 10:36.093
Hey. What the hell? You quit rugby?

10:36.177 --> 10:39.055
God. You sound like three of my dads.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.349
-The other five were relieved.
-You were good.

10:41.432 --> 10:45.436
I need to focus on my studies.
I'm not just here to get my ya-yas out.

10:45.519 --> 10:47.355
Yeah, but rugby's our thing.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.858
Okay, then I guess we'll just--
We'll find a new thing.

10:50.941 --> 10:54.695
How about my thing is reading
<i>Gender Trouble </i>by Judith Butler,

10:54.779 --> 10:56.989
and your thing is being a teacher?

10:57.073 --> 10:57.990
Are you okay?

10:58.074 --> 11:00.826
I'm just busy with school stuff.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.828
You got your showcase in a couple weeks?

11:02.912 --> 11:04.705
"An Evening of Modern American Scenes"?

11:04.789 --> 11:06.957
Yeah. I'll-- I'll go to that.

11:07.041 --> 11:10.294
-Great. I'll see you then.
-Yeah, see you then.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.754
Not if I see you first--!

11:18.427 --> 11:19.428
-Hello?
-Hey, listen.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.722
-It's your very good accountant, Gaz.
-Hey, Gaz.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.933
I just noticed you spent
a lot of money last year.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.977
-Did you go to rehab? Like, a lot?
-You just noticed that?

11:27.061 --> 11:30.523
I've got a ton of clients, okay?
And this was a big cocaine year for me.

11:30.606 --> 11:33.067
But we're fine. Just make another movie,
and you'll be fine.

11:33.150 --> 11:34.402
-You're working on a movie?
<i>-No.</i>

11:34.485 --> 11:36.487
Actually, I'm a college professor now.

11:36.570 --> 11:38.572
What, do you hate money?

11:38.656 --> 11:40.241
-<i>Gaz...</i>
-Ah, no, no, no, it's fine.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.535
Basically, we're fine.
As I told my wife before she left me,

11:42.618 --> 11:44.704
I'm not worried,
and you shouldn't be either.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.414
We may need to unload some assets, though.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.249
-You still own that restaurant?
-Elefante?

11:48.332 --> 11:51.377
I'd love to dump that money pit,
but what idiot would buy it?

11:51.585 --> 11:56.340
-Sold! On this arrangement.
-Of course you're sold. It was your idea.

11:56.507 --> 11:59.218
Explain it to me one more time?

11:59.301 --> 12:01.053
Okay. You'll spend a lot of time

12:01.137 --> 12:03.806
with international superstar
sex symbol, Joey Pogo,

12:03.889 --> 12:05.683
building a close emotional bond.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.268
After you've established that connection,

12:07.351 --> 12:10.396
you'll share one magical evening
of intimate sexual congress,

12:10.479 --> 12:11.939
after which, we'll finally be even.

12:12.022 --> 12:15.735
You'll marry me, and the two of you
will never see each other again.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.862
-Well, I guess it's worth a try.
-♪ <i>Who's that dog? ♪</i>

12:17.945 --> 12:19.155
<i>-♪ Mr. Peanutbutter ♪</i>
-Excuse me.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.364
-Hello? No?

12:20.448 --> 12:22.158
Really? Wow, hold on a sec.

12:22.324 --> 12:23.993
Pickles, should I buy Elefante?

12:24.076 --> 12:27.288
Ooh! Then you'd be my husband and my boss.

12:27.371 --> 12:29.206
Like Ike and Tina Turn-- No.

12:29.290 --> 12:32.084
-Well, I'm sure there are good examples.
-There must be.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.211
But buying a restaurant's
a big commitment.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.797
What if I went in on it with you?
I like food.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.508
Great idea, Joey Pogo. I'm in!

12:39.592 --> 12:42.511
On you being in. On it. With me.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.722
I've got big ideas for this place.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.932
One word-- lazy Susans.

12:47.016 --> 12:47.892
Hold on.

12:47.975 --> 12:52.646
Before we make any rash decisions,
should we maybe consider the long-term...

12:52.730 --> 12:56.025
Pickles, this guy on the phone
is waiting, and I don't want to be rude.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.444
Sorry. Of course.
Finish your conversation.

12:58.527 --> 13:00.154
-Sold!

13:00.237 --> 13:02.239
-Now, you were saying?
-...ramifications.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.033
Lazy Susans.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.913
Oh, Heidi,
you'll never bag a man

13:08.996 --> 13:10.623
with all your talk of feminism,

13:10.706 --> 13:13.876
and your grandfather in Switzerland,
and all your little goat friends--

13:13.959 --> 13:16.796
Stop. Terry, this character is 28.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.381
Is that what you think
a 28-year-old sounds like?

13:19.465 --> 13:20.841
I mean, yes?

13:20.925 --> 13:23.135
You do the same old-man voice
for every character.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.387
Gotta have a gimmick if I'm gonna make it
in the show business.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.847
In "the show business,"

13:26.931 --> 13:29.892
when they have old man characters,
they cast real old men.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.352
-I'll show you.
-Please don't.

13:31.435 --> 13:33.646
You'll see.

13:33.729 --> 13:36.065
We still have 20 minutes of class left.

13:38.108 --> 13:42.071
I'd driven across that bridge drunk
hundreds of times, but never on black ice.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.031
- Back in my day,

13:44.114 --> 13:47.284
-we called that "the hidden slipperies."
-Oh, no.

13:47.368 --> 13:50.120
But we didn't go to meetings
and talk about our problems.

13:50.204 --> 13:53.749
-No, we made moonshine in bathtubs.
-Please leave. Now.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.000
-Who's Terry?
-Nobody said Terry.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.753
Mind if I sit a spell?
These old bones need a rest.

13:57.837 --> 13:58.754
Sure, take it easy.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.048
Everyone, this is another one
of my students.

14:01.131 --> 14:04.468
I'm very sorry, I have no idea
why they think this is gonna impress me.

14:04.552 --> 14:07.221
I just relieved myself in my adult diaper.

14:07.304 --> 14:08.138
Terry...

14:08.222 --> 14:12.434
Here I am, in the twilight of my years,
having drunk it all away.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.603
-My job as an airline pilot...
-Wow.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.772
-My son...
-You don't have a son.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.358
Not anymore I don't,
because I abandoned him.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.068
I abandoned my boy!

14:21.151 --> 14:22.862
- Papa?
-My boy!

14:22.945 --> 14:25.114
-Oh, my God.
-Papa? Is that you?

14:25.197 --> 14:28.701
I've gone blind, me has,
from working in the distillery!

14:28.784 --> 14:30.244
Oh, my sweet child!

14:31.453 --> 14:32.454
Ugh.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.544
Todd, why don't you and Ruthie
go for a stroll

14:38.627 --> 14:40.296
while I talk to these acting students?

14:40.379 --> 14:43.299
She's just a baby, and I don't want
to expose her to too much desperation.

14:43.382 --> 14:46.051
-You got it, boss.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.387
Today, we have a very special guest.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.514
This is my friend, Princess Carolyn,

14:50.598 --> 14:55.019
who was nice enough to come here
to talk about the business of acting.

14:55.102 --> 14:57.771
So, please do not embarrass me.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.356
Oh, no.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.067
How many months
until people get discovered, usually?

15:02.151 --> 15:05.070
One? Two?  Three?

15:05.529 --> 15:09.742
This is more of a comment than a question,
but I've seen every Robert Altman movie.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.786
What's the best diner to be discovered in
drinking a milkshake?

15:13.829 --> 15:17.666
What if I want to do nudity?
Do I still have to sign a waiver?

15:18.042 --> 15:18.876
Huh!

15:21.211 --> 15:22.212
Whoo!

15:23.839 --> 15:25.799
Hey, who's the kid
that didn't ask a question?

15:25.883 --> 15:28.052
-The brooding kid in the back.
-Oh, that's Stan.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.219
That kid's got it.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.638
The look, the sauce,

15:30.721 --> 15:33.682
the power to make me feel
like a 13-year-old girl,

15:33.766 --> 15:36.101
and to make a 13-year-old girl
feel like a woman.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.311
I wanna cast him.

15:37.394 --> 15:38.979
-You haven't even seen him act.
-Is he good?

15:39.688 --> 15:42.149
He's the best actor I got.

15:42.232 --> 15:44.401
I had my doubts
when he did the scene from <i>Proof,</i>

15:44.485 --> 15:47.112
but when he did the scene from <i>Doubt,</i>
I thought, "There's the proof."

15:47.321 --> 15:48.572
-I have to sign him.
-No.

15:48.656 --> 15:51.116
Stan needs to finish school.
He's a sophomore.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.619
Great! A legal adult but he looks young.

15:53.702 --> 15:56.830
He can play all the roles that other
young, impressionable actors can't

15:56.914 --> 15:59.792
because they keep ODing,
or going to prison, or going to rehab,

15:59.875 --> 16:00.960
or killing themselves.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.921
-No, he's not ready.
-Why don't we let Stan decide?

16:05.255 --> 16:07.174
I want to be your manager.

16:07.257 --> 16:11.929
And I can get you Brooding Birthday Boy
on "Birthday Dad" right now.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.847
Stan, LA's not going anywhere.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.558
But you need an education,
something to keep you grounded.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.561
Stan, look at me.
You have an opportunity now.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.439
What do you need, a piece of paper?
You're done with this place.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.608
Stan? Stan. Stan, Stan.

16:24.692 --> 16:28.612
One day, you're gonna look back
and realize these days on campus,

16:28.696 --> 16:31.281
they were the last days
you were truly free.

16:31.365 --> 16:32.241
You want "free"?

16:32.324 --> 16:35.327
Check out the Smirnoff Ice gifting suite
at the <i>Emmy Awards</i> after-party!

16:35.411 --> 16:38.831
My whole career, all I wanted
was to get to a place like this,

16:38.914 --> 16:39.999
and I didn't even know it.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.084
Out there, there's nothing to protect you.

16:42.167 --> 16:45.754
No, but there's a Patagonia jacket
that says "Birthday Dad" on it

16:45.838 --> 16:47.923
that you get from being on "Birthday Dad."

16:48.007 --> 16:51.802
We're safe here, Stan.
Please, don't make the mistake I did.

16:52.011 --> 16:55.723
Come on, you'll get your own chair
with your name on it!

16:55.806 --> 16:59.518
- Damn it.
-Oh, good boy. Yes, he's a good boy.

16:59.601 --> 17:01.937
Okay, first thing,
we're gonna get these teeth fixed.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.243
Marshmallow?

17:18.454 --> 17:20.205
Thanks!

17:20.289 --> 17:21.373
That was for the child.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.417
Oh, should've specified.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.211
If she can abstain from eating
the marshmallow for 15 minutes,

17:26.295 --> 17:28.130
she'll receive an even bigger reward.

17:28.213 --> 17:31.341
An even bigger reward than a marshmallow?

17:31.425 --> 17:33.635
Remember these times, Ruthie.

17:33.719 --> 17:34.720
Mm-hmm.

17:39.349 --> 17:41.602
-Go Todd for Maude!
-You're sitting in front of a marshmallow,

17:41.685 --> 17:44.063
and if you don't eat it,
you get a bigger reward in 15 minutes.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.856
-What do you do?
-Don't be a sucker, Todd.

17:45.939 --> 17:46.982
Eat the marshmallow.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.193
Who knows what the world's gonna be like
in 15 minutes?

17:49.276 --> 17:50.611
That's all I needed to hear.

17:50.694 --> 17:51.945
-Thanks, Maude.

17:54.114 --> 17:58.285
Oh, no! What have I done?
We've got to find another marshmallow!

17:58.368 --> 18:00.537
-Hey, Todd. You've got the Maude Squad.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.414
Just kidding, it's just Maude.
I don't have a squad.

18:02.498 --> 18:03.999
Maude? I didn't go to college.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.210
-Where can I get a marshmallow?
-The dining hall?

18:06.293 --> 18:09.421
Dining hall?
This is Wesleyan, not Hogwarts.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.424
What's in a marshmallow anyway?
Maybe I can make one.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.468
I think they're mostly chemicals.

18:14.551 --> 18:16.762
To the chemistry lab!

18:19.014 --> 18:22.101
- You! Make me a marshmallow!

18:22.184 --> 18:24.394
I'm trying to cure brain cancer.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.480
That's not important right now!

18:26.563 --> 18:27.981
If I don't get a new marshmallow,

18:28.065 --> 18:30.651
some psychiatrist
is gonna get mad at this baby.

18:30.734 --> 18:31.944
A psychiatrist?

18:32.027 --> 18:35.072
I am so sick of the soft sciences
wagging the dog

18:35.155 --> 18:37.366
in conversations
of behavioral development.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.867
Let's teach them a lesson!

18:52.923 --> 18:55.801
-I'm sorry, but the experiment's over.
-What? Why?

18:55.884 --> 18:58.804
Because you ate the marshmallow.
Good day, sir.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.222
Doctor?

19:03.642 --> 19:04.476
You did it!

19:04.560 --> 19:09.481
Hello, my name is Willie Wesleyan,
and you've won the school, my boy!

19:09.565 --> 19:12.526
Wesleyan University is yours.

19:12.609 --> 19:13.986
What? Why?

19:14.069 --> 19:17.447
Somebody needs to keep
that stuffy old board of trustees in check

19:17.531 --> 19:19.992
once I've shed this mortal skin.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.286
-Oh...
-Sorry about that.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.872
We're doing LSD research
in the room next door.

19:24.955 --> 19:27.875
-Come on, Mr. Phillips. Time to go.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.751
The frozzleberries
taste like banozzleberries!

19:29.835 --> 19:33.338
Yes, Mr. Phillips,
everything tastes like something.

19:35.090 --> 19:37.551
So this is college.

19:42.389 --> 19:45.851
-You wanted to see me?
-Amy, yeah. Um, have a seat.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.936
So we're nearing
the end of the semester here,

19:48.020 --> 19:50.856
and I'm putting together the cast sheet
for the student showcase.

19:50.939 --> 19:53.567
-Uh-huh.
-This showcase is a big deal.

19:53.650 --> 19:57.738
This might sound crazy coming from
famous television star, BoJack Horseman,

19:57.821 --> 20:00.949
but in some ways,
this showcase means even more to me

20:01.033 --> 20:04.161
than the very popular TV shows
that, again, I was the star of.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.246
-It means a lot to me, too.
-Does it?

20:06.330 --> 20:07.706
'Cause you've been missing
a lot of classes.

20:07.789 --> 20:10.459
And forgetting your lines.
You seem tired all the time, and...

20:10.542 --> 20:12.711
I can be better. I'll prove it.

20:13.003 --> 20:13.921
Okay.

20:15.088 --> 20:18.258
As the water rose, I remember
fumbling through the glove compartment,

20:18.342 --> 20:20.552
just praying
that I could find a pin hammer

20:20.636 --> 20:22.346
so I could shatter the window.

20:22.429 --> 20:26.058
-Uh, excuse me, is this...
-No. Nope, no, no, no. Get out of here.

20:26.141 --> 20:27.309
-This has to stop.
-What?

20:27.392 --> 20:30.729
This is a place for people who are serious
about making a change,

20:30.854 --> 20:33.982
not for desperate acting students
pretending to have problems, Amy.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.359
I was just trying to get help!

20:35.442 --> 20:36.818
-Oof!

20:36.902 --> 20:38.904
Oh! Oops! That was...

20:40.989 --> 20:41.990
Oops.

20:49.623 --> 20:53.418
-Hey, do you know what this show's about?
-I think it's about to start.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.754
So keep your rugby voice
on the field, okay?

20:55.837 --> 20:59.341
It turns out my hypothesis was correct.
Kids love marshmallows.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.425
You don't say.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.094
You still working on that memoir?

21:02.177 --> 21:04.263
Well, funny story about that...

21:04.346 --> 21:09.351
Oh, I love when stories start like that!
Ooh! You should put this one in your book.

21:11.395 --> 21:12.729
Where the hell is she?

21:13.105 --> 21:15.691
Horse professor, we're ready when you are.

21:17.859 --> 21:18.902
Lights.

21:21.405 --> 21:22.739
-Hello.

21:22.823 --> 21:25.659
Thank you. Oh, wow, thank you.
That's very nice, thank you.

21:25.742 --> 21:28.870
Welcome to
"An Evening of Modern American Scenes."

21:28.954 --> 21:31.498
The students are very excited
to perform for you tonight.

21:31.581 --> 21:34.793
They've come such a long way
over the course of the semester.

21:34.876 --> 21:38.463
Like, a really-- a really long way.
They were very bad before.

21:38.547 --> 21:39.631
But now...

21:40.048 --> 21:42.884
Well, I mean,
you'll see for yourself, uh...

21:42.968 --> 21:45.595
But, um, I'm proud of them.

21:46.179 --> 21:50.225
Anyway, first up is a scene
from Sam German-Shepherd's "Real America."

21:53.770 --> 21:55.814
You think real America's
all about cowboys?

21:56.815 --> 22:00.277
Well, I say real America's about business!
And capitalism!

22:00.360 --> 22:02.029
- <i>Hey, it's Hollyhock.</i>
-Ugh!

22:02.112 --> 22:04.573
<i>-Leave a message, if you're a hundred.</i>
-God damn it.

22:04.656 --> 22:08.201
I'm starting to think the real America
is me kicking your ass!

22:12.414 --> 22:15.083
BoJack? Oh, shit, your showcase!

22:15.167 --> 22:17.044
Tawnie's gonna be so pissed!

22:17.127 --> 22:19.755
Forget Tawnie. I'm pissed!
And it's happening right now.

22:19.838 --> 22:21.381
I'm sorry. I forgot.

22:21.465 --> 22:25.969
I know your students just have to do
a scene, but I have multiple final papers.

22:26.053 --> 22:28.930
If you're implying
acting is a bullshit major, you're right.

22:29.014 --> 22:31.850
But people came all the way
from California to see my showcase.

22:31.933 --> 22:34.770
From Chicago.
You can't even walk across campus?

22:34.853 --> 22:36.980
Okay, let me put some pants on.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.941
-You've been avoiding me all semester.
-I just have a lot going on.

22:40.025 --> 22:42.152
I go to school here.
I'm a college student.

22:42.235 --> 22:45.155
-I thought I'd see you more.
-This was mine before you got here.

22:45.238 --> 22:49.785
This was my life, my world,
and you just, like, live here now.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.995
And you could have asked me, by the way.

22:52.079 --> 22:54.956
Okay, I'm sorry.
I guess I thought my sister...

22:55.040 --> 22:57.918
No, don't say that.
Like it means something.

22:58.001 --> 23:00.921
-It does mean something.
-We don't know each other, really.

23:01.004 --> 23:04.049
-What?
-No, I'm just saying it's fine.

23:04.132 --> 23:08.970
I had a life before I met you,
and you had a life before you met me.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.347
I don't want that life.

23:10.430 --> 23:14.518
That life, that person?
That's not who I am, I...

23:15.727 --> 23:18.146
I'm sorry I came here
without asking you first.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.314
That was selfish.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.608
Okay. Thank you.

23:21.691 --> 23:24.986
If this is too weird for you,
I don't have to come back next semester.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.114
I can get a job somewhere else.

23:27.197 --> 23:30.033
Tawnie says you're a really good teacher.

23:30.117 --> 23:32.911
She did? Huh.
I thought you were in a fight.

23:32.994 --> 23:35.038
Yeah, but I still love her.

23:35.831 --> 23:36.665
Are we in a fight?

23:37.165 --> 23:39.501
Yeah, but...

23:39.709 --> 23:40.544
Yeah.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.879
I should get back to the show.

23:42.963 --> 23:47.134
If you want to come back in the fall,
that could be cool.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.301
-Yeah?
-Just...

23:48.385 --> 23:50.595
We need to take things slow, you know?

23:51.721 --> 23:53.932
Yeah. I know.

23:54.599 --> 23:55.684
Thanks.

23:55.976 --> 24:00.480
<i>And in that moment,</i>
<i>I knew this was my home.</i>

24:02.274 --> 24:03.942
<i>And as long as I was here,</i>

24:05.277 --> 24:06.528
<i>I'd be safe.</i>

24:07.696 --> 24:09.656
-But then again, what do I know?

24:09.739 --> 24:14.202
I'm just a 15-year-old boy
living in Brighton Beach.

24:21.168 --> 24:22.377
Yeah!

24:23.879 --> 24:24.796
Horse professor.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.506
-Come on. Get up here.
-No, no, no.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.675
-Get up here.
-No, no, no. Come on.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.346
Thank you.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.765
Thank you so much.

24:53.700 --> 24:54.784
Uh... Hello?

24:54.868 --> 24:56.995
-You need to stop this.
-What?

24:57.078 --> 25:00.415
The reporters who keep trying
to get Penny to tell her story.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.458
What-- What reporters?

25:01.541 --> 25:04.628
Whatever they're doing,
I don't want to be included, okay?

25:04.711 --> 25:06.922
I don't want my daughter to be included.

25:07.005 --> 25:09.216
Charlotte, I swear, I don't know
what you're talking about.

25:09.466 --> 25:11.176
