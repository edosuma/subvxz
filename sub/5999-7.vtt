00:00.039 --> 00:02.274
Previously on "Manhattan"...

00:02.309 --> 00:03.809
You didn't congratulate me.

00:03.844 --> 00:06.285
For what, getting the
lead in a racialist play?

00:06.310 --> 00:07.910
You need to lay off that pitch pipe.

00:07.935 --> 00:09.768
It's cutting off the oxygen to your brain.

00:09.804 --> 00:12.471
We should be studying the
radiological effects of the test.

00:12.506 --> 00:15.474
I swallowed 24 micrograms
of plutonium in 1943.

00:15.509 --> 00:17.409
I still make the geiger counter sing.

00:17.444 --> 00:19.411
Liza: I have followed
your orders to the letter.

00:19.446 --> 00:21.613
I haven't spoken to my
husband in months, as you know.

00:21.649 --> 00:23.248
You want me to grand you access

00:23.284 --> 00:25.673
to the most secure site
in the Western hemisphere

00:25.698 --> 00:26.706
so that you can...

00:26.731 --> 00:29.198
Determine the health effects
of atomic radiation and debris.

00:29.531 --> 00:31.264
Oh, Jesus, Helen.

00:31.299 --> 00:33.232
You owe me a lot more than a whiskey sour.

00:33.268 --> 00:34.934
Uh, that drink was actually for me.

00:34.969 --> 00:38.237
Come to G group. We need you. I need you.

00:38.273 --> 00:40.139
If you believe we have
a moral responsibility

00:40.175 --> 00:43.276
for the future of what we
are building here, follow me.

00:44.893 --> 00:46.612
Meeks: If we are the only ones who have it,

00:46.648 --> 00:48.848
we'll probably blow up the world.

00:48.883 --> 00:51.017
But if Stalin has a
bomb in his pocket, too,

00:51.052 --> 00:52.952
it's a stalemate. Nobody dies.

00:52.987 --> 00:54.587

00:54.622 --> 00:56.722

01:47.773 --> 01:49.506
Tell.

01:49.714 --> 01:52.715
- Over by the pueblo.

Uh-huh.

02:00.417 --> 02:02.969
A dead security agent

02:02.994 --> 02:04.464
Fay: Mm-hmm.

02:04.489 --> 02:06.129

02:09.340 --> 02:11.306
Dot: I don't know. Praying to it.

02:11.342 --> 02:13.075
She probably thinks it's a God.

02:13.110 --> 02:15.410
(Laughing)

02:17.948 --> 02:19.815
My son saw something.

02:21.585 --> 02:23.619
What do you mean, something?

02:25.856 --> 02:27.356
Someone.

03:06.397 --> 03:09.364
Pablo, if we put the man
you saw in front of you,

03:09.400 --> 03:11.633
would you be able to recognize him?

03:19.009 --> 03:21.410
Do you think we could bury the tomahawk?

03:23.013 --> 03:24.980
Well, you may have bollixed
your precious career,

03:25.015 --> 03:27.382
but at least you can say you
stood on the right side of history.

03:27.418 --> 03:29.184
I'm really not in the mood, Paul.

03:29.220 --> 03:32.011
No, I mean it. I wouldn't
have had the stones.

03:32.425 --> 03:33.655
Seriously.

03:45.102 --> 03:47.018
Darrow: Dr. Sinclair.

03:49.073 --> 03:51.540
Would you come with me, please?

04:04.688 --> 04:06.666
(Door closes)

04:07.891 --> 04:10.058
Well, I suppose we all saw that coming.

Mrs. Isaacs isn't there, I hope.

05:04.006 --> 05:06.006
Good.

05:06.041 --> 05:08.909
Probably off reading some
Agatha Christie novel, isn't she?

05:08.944 --> 05:10.177
Go on, then. Put me through.

05:12.977 --> 05:16.985
(Door opens, closes)

05:29.532 --> 05:31.745
Morning, Dr. Sinclair.

05:32.401 --> 05:34.701
I thought maybe we'd seen the last of you.

05:34.737 --> 05:36.503
Sorry to disappoint.

05:36.539 --> 05:39.940
Colonel's got you packing
his lunchbox, has he?

05:39.975 --> 05:41.942
We're all somebody's houseboy, I guess.

05:41.977 --> 05:43.885
You're Dr. Hogarth's, right?

05:44.980 --> 05:47.347
That why you're here so
early? Fetching his coffee?

05:49.184 --> 05:51.919
We brits prefer tea, actually.

06:00.062 --> 06:01.795
(Door closes)

06:01.830 --> 06:05.065
- Clubfoots?
- Yeah, my great uncle had it.

06:05.100 --> 06:07.668
The doctor says it runs in families.

06:07.703 --> 06:09.503
I mean, it can't run very fast.

06:09.538 --> 06:13.040
Fritzie! I don't care
if our kids have no feet

06:13.075 --> 06:14.975
as long as they're ours.

06:15.010 --> 06:16.977
Okay, but if you get pregnant,

06:17.012 --> 06:18.745
they'll kick you out of the army.

06:18.781 --> 06:20.547
You keep telling me the war
will be over by fall anyway.

06:20.583 --> 06:22.282
Well, you know, I'm prone to hyperbole.

06:23.786 --> 06:25.720
Don't you want children?

06:26.388 --> 06:28.355
I mean, is this because
of my old night job?

06:28.390 --> 06:30.357
No! No, no, no, no.

06:30.392 --> 06:33.760
Having kids with you is the number
one thing that I want out of life.

06:33.796 --> 06:37.030
I just wonder if maybe
we should, you know, wait.

06:37.066 --> 06:39.266
See what my prospects
are like after the war.

06:39.301 --> 06:42.065
Why do I feel like there's
something you're not telling me?

06:44.406 --> 06:48.675
Okay, um, the doc,

06:48.711 --> 06:51.511
he did give me some other bad news.

06:51.547 --> 06:53.647
He said...

06:56.051 --> 06:58.652
That I need to lose a few pounds.

07:00.422 --> 07:01.888
Oh.

07:01.924 --> 07:03.523
I don't want you to lose a single ounce.

07:03.559 --> 07:05.225
Mm-hmm.

07:05.260 --> 07:06.760
- Well.
- Well, except the mustache.

07:06.795 --> 07:08.395
- It's a little... 
- What?

07:08.430 --> 07:09.596
Scratchy.

07:09.632 --> 07:11.898
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

07:11.934 --> 07:13.400

07:13.435 --> 07:16.036
Fritz: Hey! Look! Clark Gable!

07:16.071 --> 07:17.604
Are you two skipping school?

07:17.640 --> 07:19.239
No, I'm off to the desert.

07:19.274 --> 07:21.141
But I'll be back in time
to see you on the boards.

07:21.176 --> 07:22.876
That's theater lingo, right?

07:22.911 --> 07:25.245
Well, at this rate, I might
not make it to opening night.

07:25.280 --> 07:27.414
Well, hey, if you get stage
fright, just picture everyone naked.

07:27.449 --> 07:28.582
Except Jeannie.

07:28.617 --> 07:30.996
I got to go, boys.

07:31.021 --> 07:32.252
- Bye-bye.
- See you Friday.

07:32.287 --> 07:34.287
- Bye.
- Bye!

07:36.291 --> 07:37.706
Hey.

07:38.549 --> 07:40.761
The doctor says I still
got three or four micrograms

07:40.796 --> 07:43.114
swimming around in my gut.

07:44.099 --> 07:47.134
How do you tell your wife that you
could have a kid with three heads?

07:47.169 --> 07:50.437
Well, just be honest.

07:50.472 --> 07:52.315
You guys love each other.

07:52.340 --> 07:53.764
You'll figure it out.

Okay. Thanks.

08:25.708 --> 08:28.709
Wait. What... what exactly did he see?

08:30.308 --> 08:32.842
He said that he saw a guy
bury a box in the desert.

08:32.866 --> 08:34.514
What was a little kid
doing out in the desert?

08:34.549 --> 08:36.316
They live there. That's not the point.

08:36.351 --> 08:38.118
Well, who's to say he'd recognize me?

08:38.153 --> 08:39.686
And even if he did, what did he see?

08:39.722 --> 08:42.322
He saw me bury a candy
bar. What does that prove?

08:42.357 --> 08:45.525
A candy bar with code written on
the wrapper in your handwriting.

08:45.561 --> 08:48.128
It's just a matter of time
before they recognize you.

08:48.163 --> 08:51.131
Here. Take this. Say you're
taking a day trip to Santa Fe

08:51.166 --> 08:52.699
and then cross the Texas border.

08:52.735 --> 08:54.901
What's in Texas?

08:54.937 --> 08:56.803
There is a motel called
the Palmetto in el Paso

08:56.839 --> 08:58.488
and someone's gonna meet you there.

08:59.059 --> 09:02.324
If I disappear, I'm gonna look guilty.

09:02.544 --> 09:04.752
You are guilty.

09:05.380 --> 09:07.047
When do I come back?

09:10.119 --> 09:12.919
Oh. No. No, no, no.

09:12.955 --> 09:16.923
No, no, no. This is... this is insane.

09:16.959 --> 09:18.358
I can't just...

09:18.393 --> 09:19.693
I can't walk away from my life.

09:19.728 --> 09:22.028

09:33.776 --> 09:35.041
It's not protocol.

09:35.493 --> 09:37.744
What about you and me?

09:37.780 --> 09:39.146
Was that protocol?

10:01.973 --> 10:03.970
An intelligence officer was killed.

10:04.006 --> 10:07.207
I assumed you wouldn't have
asked me to assay this box

10:07.242 --> 10:08.308
unless it were evidence.

10:08.343 --> 10:09.643
(Opera continues)

10:09.678 --> 10:11.244
You found polonium?

10:11.280 --> 10:13.580
Refined from bismuth and
manufactured in Dayton, Ohio.

10:13.615 --> 10:16.416
The only men on this
hill with any use for it

10:26.829 --> 10:29.796
Colonel, why come to me?

10:29.832 --> 10:31.131
I read your file.

10:31.166 --> 10:33.014
You're a man who doesn't cut corners.

10:33.836 --> 10:35.735
But how do you know I'm not the traitor?

10:35.771 --> 10:37.237
Most people on this
hill take one look at me

10:37.272 --> 10:38.939
and assume I'm some kind of criminal.

10:38.974 --> 10:42.242
Which would diminish your
utility as a spy, I'd imagine.

10:42.277 --> 10:43.643
You so much as jaywalked,

10:43.679 --> 10:47.247
I'd have a dozen well-meaning
bigots in here calling for your head.

10:47.282 --> 10:50.250
In my experience, bigots
don't often mean well.

10:50.285 --> 10:51.818
Hmm.

10:51.854 --> 10:55.188
Your dedication will be
rewarded, Dr. Sinclair.

11:05.667 --> 11:07.767
Linda: That lake where they
found the murdered body?

11:07.803 --> 11:09.269
It's a reservoir.

11:11.073 --> 11:13.840
Of course, the fish picked him
clean like an all-you-can-eat buffet.

11:13.876 --> 11:16.076
Hey. Little pitchers...

11:19.882 --> 11:22.736
Hey, she's not scaring you, is she?

11:23.685 --> 11:25.892
Me neither. You want to know why?

11:27.222 --> 11:29.141
Well...

11:30.525 --> 11:33.493
You see this lady? This is Athena.

11:33.528 --> 11:35.061
She's a famous warrior

11:35.097 --> 11:37.297
and she watches over
the women's army corps.

11:37.332 --> 11:40.700
As long as I wear this, no one can hurt me.

11:40.736 --> 11:43.045
You want to try it? Okay.

11:45.702 --> 11:47.468
Now you don't have to worry.

11:47.493 --> 11:49.874
If you see the man, you
know you're protected.

11:54.082 --> 11:56.016
Thank you.

12:00.355 --> 12:02.022
Okay, I'm sorry.

12:02.057 --> 12:04.891
Colonel's revoked all
passage for tech area staff.

12:04.927 --> 12:06.593
Since when?

12:06.628 --> 12:08.862
There's no travel off the
hill till further notice.

12:08.897 --> 12:10.530
(Whistles)

12:10.565 --> 12:12.365
Yeah. Back up.

12:26.793 --> 12:28.835
Nora: They stopped him at the gate,

12:28.953 --> 12:30.752
but he can't hide out in his room forever.

12:30.788 --> 12:33.822
He's got work and he's
the lead in the play.

12:33.858 --> 12:35.624
You sure the boy saw him?

12:35.659 --> 12:38.084
- They seem sure.
- (Scoffs)

12:38.109 --> 12:40.095
But he's not as green as you think.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.219
He might be able to talk his way out of it.

12:43.501 --> 12:46.034
There's a cathedral in Santa Fe.

12:46.070 --> 12:49.848
Basilica of St. Francis. Do you know it?

12:50.307 --> 12:52.474
I've not had a lot of time for sightseeing.

12:52.510 --> 12:53.842
It's the third church

12:53.878 --> 12:56.478
to be built on the same plot of land.

12:56.514 --> 12:58.146
The first one, the pueblo tore down

12:58.182 --> 12:59.481
when they threw out the Spanish...

12:59.517 --> 13:02.239
And God.

13:02.686 --> 13:05.854
The Spanish come back a few years later,

13:05.890 --> 13:07.155
build a bigger church.

13:07.191 --> 13:09.558
Then tear that one down themselves,

13:09.593 --> 13:11.718
build an even bigger one.

13:12.329 --> 13:14.296
Now God can really put his feet up.

13:14.331 --> 13:15.864
What is the punch line?

13:15.900 --> 13:17.833
Sometimes you have to
burn what you've built

13:18.324 --> 13:19.523
if you want to grow.

13:19.548 --> 13:21.147
We need him.

13:22.540 --> 13:25.073
"Brooklyn." No ideology.

13:25.109 --> 13:28.076
No beliefs beyond himself.
Thinks he's in a spy picture.

13:28.112 --> 13:31.013
- He's done well.
- Then what are we doing here?

13:32.023 --> 13:33.882
In the kremlin, there's a list of names.

13:33.918 --> 13:36.318
Mine's there. Yours, too.

13:36.629 --> 13:38.362
Our whole family. If we fail...

13:38.387 --> 13:39.686
I know!

13:41.125 --> 13:42.821
Of course.

13:44.028 --> 13:45.727
I'm sorry.

13:48.492 --> 13:50.827
You can't burn what you haven't yet built.

13:51.591 --> 13:52.957
The test is in two months.

13:52.982 --> 13:55.203
Let me stop it.

13:55.239 --> 13:57.406
Let us.

13:57.441 --> 13:59.370
I need him.

14:00.084 --> 14:01.945
And you're wrong. He
does believe in something.

14:01.970 --> 14:03.718
- What?
- Me.

14:07.952 --> 14:10.118
My little girl.

14:13.757 --> 14:15.591
I already have one.

14:16.453 --> 14:18.160
They're not for you.

14:43.988 --> 14:47.052
(Indistinct chatter)

14:47.114 --> 14:49.157
Fritz: You've got to lift with your hams.

14:49.193 --> 14:52.160
Trust me, you do not want to slip a disc.

14:52.196 --> 14:55.263
Anyway, it was an official announcement.

14:55.299 --> 14:57.766
All tech area staff now
qualify for hazard pay.

14:57.801 --> 14:59.401
20 cents an hour.

14:59.436 --> 15:01.603
So you didn't blow off
your career for nothing.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.972
We walked out for a seat
on the target committee,

15:04.008 --> 15:06.775
- not for pocket change.
- I know, but still.

15:06.810 --> 15:08.777
It was bad timing, plain and simple.

15:08.812 --> 15:11.234
Everyone's all broken up about FDR

15:11.375 --> 15:14.909
and Truman is not going to listen
to a bunch of pinko scientists.

15:14.945 --> 15:16.578
That man is a strike breaker.

15:16.613 --> 15:19.212
So nobody cares if there is no Nazi bomb?

15:19.237 --> 15:21.237
Well, we don't know that
there's no Nazi bomb.

15:21.262 --> 15:22.728
We just don't know that there is one.

15:22.753 --> 15:25.091
Which is a good thing, right?

15:25.434 --> 15:26.866
I mean, look on the bright side.

15:26.891 --> 15:28.590
The colonel didn't court-martial you.

15:28.615 --> 15:30.848
Which, by the way, why didn't he?

15:32.621 --> 15:34.387
I should probably skedaddle.

15:34.423 --> 15:36.022
She must be here by now.

15:36.058 --> 15:38.391
All right, well, send her my regards.

15:38.427 --> 15:40.026
Will do.

15:40.062 --> 15:42.228
Lift with your hams!

16:05.887 --> 16:07.854
Liza: Look at this place!

16:07.889 --> 16:09.856
Must be 100,000 acres.

16:09.891 --> 16:11.958
Fritz: 270,000, give or take.

16:11.993 --> 16:14.060
We've got 20 miles of roads,

16:14.096 --> 16:16.062
200 miles of telephone wires,

16:16.098 --> 16:18.264
a polo league, three barracks...

16:18.300 --> 16:20.066
Great. Plenty of manpower.

16:20.102 --> 16:22.068
I'm going to need some research assistants.

16:22.104 --> 16:25.238
Oh, well, it's not quite that easy.

16:25.273 --> 16:26.606
All resources need to be approved

16:26.641 --> 16:28.875
by the experiment review board.

16:28.910 --> 16:31.044
And who's the head of the
experiment review board?

16:31.079 --> 16:32.594
Um...

16:38.687 --> 16:40.806
Dr. Winter.

16:41.823 --> 16:43.256
Good to have you on the payroll.

16:43.291 --> 16:45.325
I really appreciate the opportunity.

16:45.360 --> 16:49.662
I understand that you and my
husband had your differences.

16:49.698 --> 16:51.168
Is he still your husband?

16:52.501 --> 16:53.900
Fritz may have explained to you

16:53.935 --> 16:55.335
that I'm looking to establish a baseline...

16:55.370 --> 16:56.803
Two GIs,

16:56.838 --> 16:59.739
as long as they're not assigned
to a higher priority project.

16:59.774 --> 17:01.908
And they're all higher priority.

17:01.943 --> 17:05.482
- No offense.
- None taken.

17:07.516 --> 17:08.948
Welcome to Trinity.

17:10.719 --> 17:13.286
They called in 23 guys
for a mandatory blood test,

17:13.320 --> 17:15.188
everyone who had access to polonium.

17:15.223 --> 17:17.917
They're saying that it's
an excess of caution.

17:18.282 --> 17:19.692
It could be nothing.

17:19.728 --> 17:22.494
It's a lineup. They found
traces of it on the box.

17:22.531 --> 17:24.212
Must have been on your hands.

17:26.667 --> 17:28.146
We have a day.

17:28.803 --> 17:30.426
For what?

17:31.306 --> 17:33.173
Is this...

17:34.409 --> 17:35.708
First you tell me to run

17:35.744 --> 17:37.277
and now I'm supposed to kill myself?

17:37.312 --> 17:39.946
- Jesus.
- Calm down.

17:39.981 --> 17:41.522
It's a last resort.

17:41.983 --> 17:44.150
But an intelligence officer is dead,

17:44.186 --> 17:46.152
and you gift wrapped American's
best kept secret for the Soviets.

17:46.188 --> 17:48.021
So if they catch you,
you're going to want it.

17:48.056 --> 17:50.523
- I have one, too.
- Oh, great.

17:50.559 --> 17:52.392
They can bury us side by
side like Romeo and Juliet,

17:52.427 --> 17:54.160
or didn't you read that one?

17:54.196 --> 17:56.795
They can't bury you if
they can't identify you.

17:57.933 --> 17:59.532
I'm taking care of it.

18:07.342 --> 18:09.576
Meeks: Poison?

18:09.611 --> 18:11.255
Absolutely not.

18:12.013 --> 18:13.746
He's just a boy.

18:13.782 --> 18:15.348
I'll turn myself in

18:15.383 --> 18:17.350
before I let you take
care of a 10-year-old boy.

18:17.385 --> 18:19.319
How many 10-year-olds do
you think are in Tokyo?

18:19.354 --> 18:21.354
- Oh, God.
- Or Yokohama?

18:21.389 --> 18:23.189
You're the only person
that can stop Harry Truman

18:23.225 --> 18:24.991
from taking care of them.

18:25.026 --> 18:27.560
You're a scientist. That's simple math.

18:27.596 --> 18:29.195
Oh, you can't make an omelet

18:29.231 --> 18:30.763
without poisoning an
Indian kid, is that it?

18:30.799 --> 18:32.265
I'm not asking your permission.

18:32.300 --> 18:34.000
That's exactly what you're doing.

18:34.035 --> 18:36.002
Why else would you even
be here telling me this?

18:36.037 --> 18:39.005
Just give me 12 hours. 12 hours.

18:39.040 --> 18:40.373
- All right?
- Why?

18:40.408 --> 18:42.242
What are you going to do?

19:01.396 --> 19:03.396
It's an ecological survey.

19:03.431 --> 19:05.798
We're measuring the presence
of certain substances

19:05.834 --> 19:07.800
in the native plants and animals

19:07.836 --> 19:10.621
to assess the implications of the, um...

19:11.840 --> 19:13.273
Of the device.

19:15.277 --> 19:16.643
Implications?

19:16.678 --> 19:18.411
On a bunch of coyotes and tumbleweeds?

19:18.446 --> 19:21.814
At the moment, we call
this a scientific control

19:21.850 --> 19:23.816
- so that after the test... 
- Look, lady.

19:23.852 --> 19:25.885
It's Uncle Sam's nickel.
What do you want us to do?

19:25.920 --> 19:29.255
You're each responsible for
a particular set of specimens.

19:29.291 --> 19:32.058
I want you to collect them,
I want you to bag them,

19:32.093 --> 19:34.627
and I want you to catalog
exactly where you found them.

19:34.663 --> 19:36.329
Frank: Like a scavenger hunt.

19:37.332 --> 19:39.098
Beats digging latrines.

19:40.468 --> 19:43.102
Yes, it's like a scavenger hunt...

19:43.138 --> 19:45.016
For science.

19:45.674 --> 19:47.173
Can you give us a moment?

19:49.907 --> 19:51.277
What are you doing here?

19:51.313 --> 19:53.140
Just wanted to see you.

19:53.882 --> 19:55.315
Well, now you have.

19:56.318 --> 19:57.987
You testing for calcium?

19:59.020 --> 20:01.654
And iodine and rhodium.

20:01.690 --> 20:03.189
What about strontium?

20:03.224 --> 20:04.857
It's just a hunch,

20:04.893 --> 20:07.327
but it could be nuclear by-product.

20:11.499 --> 20:13.550
So you still seeing Joe Pulitzer?

20:14.035 --> 20:16.102
I'm sorry.

20:16.137 --> 20:18.871
- What are you doing here?
- I'm volunteering.

20:18.907 --> 20:21.341
I understand this work better
than anyone else out there.

20:21.376 --> 20:23.309
I believe in it. I can help you.

20:23.345 --> 20:25.178
And do you imagine just because

20:25.213 --> 20:26.612
we're in a different part of the desert

20:26.648 --> 20:28.448
that colonel Darrow won't find out?

20:28.483 --> 20:30.316
Who cares if he does?

20:30.352 --> 20:32.384
Let him ship me off to Borneo.

20:33.154 --> 20:35.288
You really don't get it, do you?

20:35.323 --> 20:37.918
This is my work that
you're putting at risk.

20:38.727 --> 20:41.894
I'm finally doing something that matters

20:41.930 --> 20:46.038
and you are handing colonel
Darrow an excuse to shut me down.

20:47.168 --> 20:50.207
Frank, I saw your hospital admission slip.

20:51.172 --> 20:53.339
Criticality experiments?

20:53.375 --> 20:55.708
- Radiation exposure?
- Liza...

20:55.744 --> 20:57.510
If you have a death wish, that's fine.

20:57.545 --> 20:59.746
That's your business.

21:01.349 --> 21:03.549
But keep it away from mine.

21:08.189 --> 21:09.722
Hurt me again.

21:09.758 --> 21:11.391
It's "hit me again."

21:12.672 --> 21:14.438
Give me a drink.

21:14.763 --> 21:17.730
Sweetheart, I'm a little busy.

21:17.766 --> 21:19.766
Don't sweetheart me.

21:28.209 --> 21:30.610
I did this at serious risk to my pants.

21:32.163 --> 21:33.695
Your pants are safe.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.626
I want nothing to do with
any pants except my own.

21:35.651 --> 21:38.018
So thank you, but, no, thank you.

21:38.987 --> 21:40.420
But thanks.

21:48.596 --> 21:50.396
I'm sorry.

21:50.432 --> 21:51.764
English is my second language.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.567
What I meant was scram.

21:54.602 --> 21:57.550
Stan Javits. And you're Helen?

21:58.807 --> 22:00.973
Your reputation precedes you.

22:01.009 --> 22:03.209
Really? What reputation is that?

22:03.244 --> 22:05.211
The woman who got
herself fired from G group

22:05.246 --> 22:07.213
in less than 24 hours?

22:07.248 --> 22:08.815
Dr. Helen Prins,

22:08.850 --> 22:11.451
the first author on that
thorium paper in '38.

22:13.668 --> 22:14.787
That was very precise work.

22:14.823 --> 22:16.255
That was nicely done.

22:20.462 --> 22:22.495
What are you, a metallurgist?

22:22.530 --> 22:23.996
A chemist?

22:24.032 --> 22:26.632
A lawyer. Patents.

22:28.269 --> 22:31.003
What? You thought you
guys would come up here

22:31.039 --> 22:33.659
and invent all this great
stuff and not attract lawyers?

22:34.275 --> 22:36.943
You can't have a picnic without ants.

22:38.646 --> 22:41.848
You read my thorium paper?

22:42.777 --> 22:45.318
You guys unlock the secrets of the universe

22:45.353 --> 22:49.455
and the government hires me
to lock them back up again.

22:49.491 --> 22:51.286
Right.

22:52.494 --> 22:54.121
Anyway...

22:57.065 --> 22:58.498
Consider me a fan.

23:12.881 --> 23:15.023
Excuse me, is he in?

23:15.048 --> 23:16.448
Thank you.

23:20.688 --> 23:22.555
Mrs. Isaacs, come in.

23:27.328 --> 23:28.861
Colonel, I'm sorry to bother you,

23:28.897 --> 23:31.664
but I didn't know who else to ask.

23:31.699 --> 23:33.571
I need an address.

23:34.102 --> 23:35.334
For whom?

23:35.370 --> 23:37.670
For a woman who died last year.

23:37.705 --> 23:39.805
I'm trying to contact her next of kin.

23:39.841 --> 23:42.875
This woman, she was a friend of yours?

23:42.911 --> 23:44.677
Not of mine.

23:44.712 --> 23:48.314
Of Dr. Oppenheimer, actually.

23:48.349 --> 23:50.349
Her name is Jean Tatlock.

23:52.053 --> 23:55.688
I was wondering if maybe you had a file

23:55.723 --> 23:57.323
or some kind of record.

23:57.358 --> 23:59.392
And why would you want that?

23:59.427 --> 24:00.726
Because...

24:05.567 --> 24:09.602
Because I'm responsible for her death, sir.

24:11.372 --> 24:13.024
I, um...

24:13.741 --> 24:16.709
I spoke with Miss Tatlock on the telephone

24:16.744 --> 24:20.346
shortly before she took her life,

24:20.381 --> 24:24.684
and I said some cruel things.

24:24.719 --> 24:28.287
And I believe, given her mental state,

24:28.323 --> 24:31.925
that I left her no choice.

24:33.931 --> 24:36.729
Have you discussed this with your husband?

24:38.166 --> 24:39.604
No, sir.

24:40.168 --> 24:42.935
But what I did, it was pesha,

24:42.971 --> 24:46.284
a deliberate sin against another person,

24:47.175 --> 24:50.009
and it's the most unforgivable kind.

24:51.179 --> 24:55.243
And... it...

24:56.417 --> 24:59.418
That's why God took my child.

25:01.990 --> 25:05.157
And that's why you want to
contact Miss Tatlock's family?

25:05.193 --> 25:06.492
To repent?

25:09.430 --> 25:11.266
I have money.

25:11.799 --> 25:14.400
(Voice breaks) I have more
money than I'll ever need,

25:14.435 --> 25:16.702
and I would like them to have it.

25:19.641 --> 25:21.397
Buying penance.

25:21.809 --> 25:24.647
The catholics tried that
for a while. Didn't work out.

25:25.213 --> 25:26.688
Well...

25:27.548 --> 25:29.649
Do you know where this war began?

25:32.020 --> 25:33.619
Poland?

25:33.655 --> 25:36.188
It began on another hill, in another desert

25:36.224 --> 25:38.090
3,000 years ago.

25:38.828 --> 25:41.627
All our sacrifices, yours, mine,

25:41.663 --> 25:45.197
Dr. Oppenheimer's, they
happen for a reason.

25:45.233 --> 25:48.567
We were put here to
finish what Moses started.

25:50.038 --> 25:52.772
I'm not sure I take your meaning.

25:53.968 --> 25:57.728
God doesn't accept the
US dollar, Mrs. Isaacs,

25:58.046 --> 26:00.846
but there are other paths to redemption.

26:07.221 --> 26:09.488
(Dog barks)

26:12.493 --> 26:14.393
Is this the Harper residence?

26:14.429 --> 26:16.529
Mr. and Mrs. are out.

26:16.564 --> 26:18.464
It's about your son.

26:18.499 --> 26:19.832
I've been assigned to his case.

26:23.271 --> 26:24.603
His case?

26:27.275 --> 26:31.043
Pablo is a witness to a very serious crime.

26:31.079 --> 26:34.480
If he can, in fact, identify a suspect,

26:34.515 --> 26:37.249
it won't be safe for him to return home...

26:37.285 --> 26:38.517
Ever.

26:39.721 --> 26:42.054
The colonel didn't tell us this.

26:42.090 --> 26:45.491
Well, the army has never
been a friend to your people,

26:45.526 --> 26:47.693
has it, Mrs. Ortiz?

26:47.729 --> 26:50.262
But that's where I come in.

26:50.298 --> 26:52.264
In appreciation for Pablo's help...

26:52.300 --> 26:54.567
Again assuming that he does help...

26:54.602 --> 26:57.103
The bureau of Indian affairs
has secured a place for him

26:57.138 --> 26:59.138
at one of our boarding academies.

26:59.899 --> 27:02.633
Do you know where
Pennsylvania is, Mrs. Ortiz?

27:02.910 --> 27:04.710
Near New York.

27:04.746 --> 27:07.513
So you know that it's very far away

27:07.548 --> 27:11.283
and you may not see your son
again for a very long time.

27:11.326 --> 27:13.889
But I can assure you

27:13.929 --> 27:17.590
he will have a better life.

27:18.386 --> 27:20.893
A new American name, new clothes.

27:20.928 --> 27:25.685
By the time he graduates,
you won't even recognize him.

27:26.334 --> 27:30.936
That is, if he identifies a suspect.

27:33.341 --> 27:38.444
But if my son can't remember
the man that he saw...

27:39.781 --> 27:41.313
Well, in that case,

27:41.349 --> 27:42.915
I'm afraid that we'd have no reason

27:42.950 --> 27:45.551
to send him to the academy.

27:45.586 --> 27:48.789
He'd stay here with you.

27:49.590 --> 27:52.558
I've never seen a BIA
man on the hill before.

27:53.718 --> 27:58.564
Yes. It's new protocol
under president Truman.

27:58.599 --> 28:01.400
I think I'd like to see your credentials.

28:01.435 --> 28:03.235
Excuse me?

28:03.271 --> 28:06.739
Or we could go discuss this with the army.

28:06.774 --> 28:10.142
Okay. Easy.

28:10.178 --> 28:12.178
Easy.

28:21.622 --> 28:23.589
I'm trying to help you.

28:23.624 --> 28:25.758
If you say another word
to anyone, you're dead.

28:25.793 --> 28:27.626
Your kid, too.

28:55.829 --> 28:57.829
You don't like hamburgers?

28:59.400 --> 29:01.600
You know, Hitler's a vegetarian.

29:03.037 --> 29:04.403
Fine.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.001
Do you like grilled cheese?

29:08.026 --> 29:10.326
Okay, I'll get you some.

29:16.417 --> 29:18.617
Linda taking good care of you?

29:24.280 --> 29:26.080
It's too sweet for me.

29:26.174 --> 29:27.426
I don't have the teeth for it,

29:27.461 --> 29:28.593
but go ahead and have it.

29:28.629 --> 29:30.279
Man: Giddy-up, Palomino.

29:39.440 --> 29:42.107
Probably no sodie pop in the teepees.

29:49.149 --> 29:51.550
(Knocking on door)

29:54.088 --> 29:55.958
Jim Meeks?

29:56.890 --> 29:58.794
Supposed to take you to the medical clinic.

30:00.661 --> 30:04.129
Now we need an MP escort
to a doctor's appointment?

30:17.978 --> 30:21.847
(Babies crying)

30:36.096 --> 30:38.497
(Door opens)

30:51.145 --> 30:53.560
Woman: Thank you very much, Mr. Shaw.

30:55.115 --> 30:56.815
Antrim?

30:58.685 --> 31:00.652
Right this way.

31:08.729 --> 31:11.596
Man: So what's the plot?

31:11.632 --> 31:14.466
- Huh?
- The Gilbert and Sullivan?

31:14.501 --> 31:16.802
Don't tell me you're getting
opening night jitters.

31:16.837 --> 31:18.336
No, mm-mm.

31:21.008 --> 31:23.075
Turn to your left, please.

31:25.546 --> 31:27.546
Now your right.

31:28.816 --> 31:30.549
Darrow: Face forward.

31:33.754 --> 31:35.554
Pablo?

31:36.557 --> 31:38.557
Thank you, Dr. Antrim.

31:50.571 --> 31:52.604
Woman: Cafferty?

31:55.742 --> 31:57.409
Do you know how many GIs have died

31:57.444 --> 31:59.578
while we've been camped
out in that waiting room?

32:01.381 --> 32:03.515
Oh. Colonel Darrow.

32:03.550 --> 32:06.384
Hi, I'm Jim Meeks. It's nice to...

32:08.388 --> 32:11.356
Jeez. I'm sorry.

32:11.820 --> 32:14.454
I'm all thumbs.

32:28.242 --> 32:29.908
Darrow: Pablo?

32:31.812 --> 32:34.045
Thank you, Mr. Meeks.

32:37.251 --> 32:40.267
So you couldn't find sagebrush...

32:40.408 --> 32:41.786
In the desert?

32:41.822 --> 32:43.299
Nope.

32:43.324 --> 32:45.878
And I have a conscientious
objection to killing rabbits.

32:45.893 --> 32:47.438
I mean, what's the...

32:48.762 --> 32:50.629
So who did this?

33:05.653 --> 33:07.751
(Sighs)

33:16.290 --> 33:17.706
Abby?

33:18.458 --> 33:19.824
Is the power out?

33:19.860 --> 33:21.259
The rest of the block's lit.

33:21.295 --> 33:22.627
It's shabbat.

33:22.663 --> 33:26.631
I forgot to turn the
lights on before sundown.

33:26.667 --> 33:28.146
Sorry.

33:28.262 --> 33:31.263
So now we're spending our
weekends in the stone age?

33:34.875 --> 33:36.508
We're going to be late for the play.

33:36.543 --> 33:39.781
What if we didn't go back to Brookline

33:40.480 --> 33:41.937
when the war's over?

33:41.962 --> 33:45.269
You want to stay on the
hill? It'll be a ghost town.

33:46.118 --> 33:48.051
What if we went abroad?

33:48.322 --> 33:51.152
To Palestine?

33:53.894 --> 33:56.094
- What? Abby... 
- Colonel Darrow says

33:56.129 --> 33:58.129
that we'll never be truly safe

33:58.165 --> 34:00.886
until all the world's Jews
are gathered in Jerusalem.

34:00.911 --> 34:03.612
Since when do you talk to colonel Darrow?

34:04.137 --> 34:06.805
- I went to see him.
- About the promised land?

34:07.335 --> 34:09.802
About Jean Tatlock.

34:11.511 --> 34:14.346
The day she died, I
called her on the telephone

34:14.380 --> 34:17.505
and I said some terrible things.

34:18.150 --> 34:20.725
Unforgivable things.

34:22.522 --> 34:26.400
I thought that if she broke things
off with Oppenheimer, then...

34:28.728 --> 34:30.859
- But then she... 
- Abby.

34:31.331 --> 34:32.664
Whatever you said to her, it's...

34:32.699 --> 34:35.233
It's the reason we lost the baby.

34:36.370 --> 34:37.771
No.

34:38.938 --> 34:41.406
No, that was no one's fault.

34:44.745 --> 34:46.911
You spend your entire life

34:46.947 --> 34:48.880
pondering the mysteries of the universe.

34:48.915 --> 34:50.739
And then our child dies...

34:52.552 --> 34:54.319
And you don't even ask why?

34:54.353 --> 34:57.355
Why some guy in the clouds punishes you

34:57.391 --> 35:00.091
- for something you didn't do.
- For something I did do.

35:00.127 --> 35:01.559
I killed a woman.

35:01.595 --> 35:04.396
No, Abby. No, you didn't.

35:06.767 --> 35:09.567
Listen to me. Hey.

35:15.575 --> 35:19.077
I wish I knew how to explain this.

35:22.582 --> 35:24.661
She was a sick woman.

35:25.218 --> 35:29.220
She drowned herself. End of story.

35:33.727 --> 35:35.560
Stay away from colonel Darrow.

35:35.595 --> 35:37.329
He's not your friend.

35:39.800 --> 35:42.233
I told him you wouldn't understand.

35:49.609 --> 35:52.352
Is that the man you remember?

35:53.013 --> 35:56.014
You did very well today, Pablo. Gracias.

35:58.251 --> 36:00.018
Take him back to his mother.

36:02.676 --> 36:04.074
Our hero.

36:04.207 --> 36:05.551
You ready to go?

36:07.294 --> 36:10.628
(Vocalizing)

36:23.276 --> 36:25.410
Uh, have you seen my pitch pipe?

36:25.445 --> 36:26.810
No, sorry.

36:31.485 --> 36:33.251
Jeannie: He was a trooper.

36:33.286 --> 36:36.254
You got a good kid, Mrs. Ortiz.

36:36.289 --> 36:39.290
If the colonel needs him again,
we'll send a jeep to the pueblo.

36:40.460 --> 36:42.093
Is something wrong?

36:42.129 --> 36:44.748
We're not coming back to this place.

36:45.298 --> 36:47.031
Mrs. Ortiz, I'm so sorry. I don't...

36:47.067 --> 36:48.666
He didn't see anything.

36:48.702 --> 36:51.469
We don't want any trouble
from the army, from anyone.

36:51.505 --> 36:52.837
They're gonna hurt him.

36:52.873 --> 36:54.709
Who?

36:55.308 --> 36:57.275
Did someone threaten you?

36:57.310 --> 36:59.552
(Playing pitch pipe)

37:07.087 --> 37:08.520
Hey.

37:10.524 --> 37:12.056
Where did you get this?

37:17.330 --> 37:19.531
Mrs. Ortiz.

37:24.838 --> 37:27.739
(Chattering)

37:29.843 --> 37:32.076
Oh, it's just we haven't
seen each other in two days.

37:32.112 --> 37:34.145
That's like a month in newlywed time.

37:34.181 --> 37:37.382
Oh, look. If it isn't my new neighbor.

37:37.417 --> 37:39.818
- Helen: Huh?
- Crosley: Did you not hear?

37:39.853 --> 37:42.353
The army moved Dr. Sinclair
out of his tar paper shack

37:42.389 --> 37:44.222
into the room next to mine.

37:44.257 --> 37:47.806
Seems he's connected to some
very well-placed friends now.

37:48.177 --> 37:49.727
Well, you got to take your friends

37:49.763 --> 37:51.696
where you can get them around here.

37:54.734 --> 37:56.167
Hi.

37:56.203 --> 37:58.192
Oh! There she is.

37:59.206 --> 38:01.028
Me!

38:01.608 --> 38:03.374
Jeannie!

38:05.145 --> 38:06.911
- Hi!
- Hi.

38:06.947 --> 38:09.581
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

38:10.617 --> 38:12.917

40:02.626 --> 40:04.192
You all right?

40:06.196 --> 40:07.929
I'm just feeling a little off.

40:07.964 --> 40:09.764
Well, I'll walk you home.

40:09.799 --> 40:11.599
No, no, no. Stay. Stay.

40:11.635 --> 40:13.334
No, Meeks won't mind.

40:13.370 --> 40:15.169
It's just a little headache.

40:15.205 --> 40:16.628
Okay.

40:16.653 --> 40:18.212
I'll see you later.

40:19.142 --> 40:21.044
All right.

40:21.069 --> 40:23.235
Bye.

40:23.847 --> 40:26.481
(Vocalizing)

40:28.607 --> 40:29.973
(Knocks)

40:30.009 --> 40:31.408
Jeannie!

40:31.444 --> 40:32.976
I need to ask you something.

40:33.012 --> 40:34.778
Uh, sure.

40:34.814 --> 40:37.014
Maybe after the show?

40:38.451 --> 40:40.284
God. Thank you.

40:40.319 --> 40:42.219
Where did you find this?

40:42.254 --> 40:44.026
Outside a house in row F.

40:44.852 --> 40:46.118
Huh.

40:46.143 --> 40:47.937
I found it when I dropped that Indian boy

40:47.962 --> 40:49.461
off with his mother.

40:50.830 --> 40:52.796
Indian boy?

40:52.832 --> 40:54.828
- Oh, you mean... 
- She was scared.

40:55.468 --> 40:56.934
Somebody scared her.

40:56.969 --> 41:00.003
(Mutters)

41:00.039 --> 41:05.609
I guess somebody must have, uh, stolen it.

41:08.280 --> 41:10.080
What were you doing there, Jim?

41:10.116 --> 41:12.330
What was I...

41:12.852 --> 41:15.586
- You have lost me, Jeannie.
- Man: Five minutes.

41:15.621 --> 41:19.256
- Five minutes to curtain.
- That's act two.

41:19.291 --> 41:20.858
Look, I got to...

41:20.893 --> 41:23.026
Listen, maybe after the show...

41:23.062 --> 41:25.295
Hey. Jeannie.

41:25.331 --> 41:27.030
Jeannie.

41:27.066 --> 41:28.599
Jeannie, wait, wait, wait.

41:28.634 --> 41:30.267
Jeannie! Wait, wait!

41:30.302 --> 41:31.779
Don't.

41:32.872 --> 41:35.029
Are you a spy, Jim?

41:35.450 --> 41:37.441
Are you the one the
colonel's been looking for?

41:38.484 --> 41:40.277
Jesus.

41:40.312 --> 41:41.845
You killed that man,

41:41.881 --> 41:43.347
the one that they say...

41:43.382 --> 41:44.681
No, no. No, no, no.

41:44.717 --> 41:46.784
I didn't... I didn't kill anybody.

41:46.819 --> 41:48.952
But you are a spy.

41:49.835 --> 41:51.889
Uh...

41:52.892 --> 41:54.293
Fritz!

41:55.694 --> 41:58.529
Fritz got me into it.

41:59.999 --> 42:01.182
What?

42:01.590 --> 42:03.867
Before he met you,

42:03.903 --> 42:06.503
Fritz was a different person,

42:06.539 --> 42:11.308
and he... well, we were just
trying to do the right thing.

42:11.343 --> 42:13.177
No, he would have told me.

42:13.212 --> 42:14.812
He couldn't.

42:14.847 --> 42:16.113
You'd be an accessory.

42:18.117 --> 42:19.516
I mean, don't you get

42:19.552 --> 42:21.151
how much he loves you?

42:22.354 --> 42:25.088
It kills him to lie to you.

42:25.124 --> 42:26.890
That... I don't believe you.

42:26.926 --> 42:29.092
Well, then why did you come to me first?

42:29.128 --> 42:31.361
Why not just tell Fritz?

42:35.367 --> 42:38.035
Is this why he doesn't want to have kids?

42:40.372 --> 42:42.226
Can you blame him?

42:42.575 --> 42:44.256
The spot that he's in?

42:47.648 --> 42:51.488
It's okay. It's okay.

42:52.384 --> 42:53.917
When the war's over,

42:53.953 --> 42:56.119
this all goes away.

42:56.155 --> 42:58.922
You two can go off, have a family,

42:59.391 --> 43:04.194
but for now, you can't
tell Fritz what you know.

43:04.230 --> 43:06.396
You have to trust me.

43:07.967 --> 43:09.377
Okay?

43:12.771 --> 43:15.205
Fritz was never a different person.

43:16.384 --> 43:18.575
You're the different person, Jim.

43:18.611 --> 43:20.983
- Jeannie.
- And you're a liar.

43:21.324 --> 43:22.923
Your best friend...

43:22.948 --> 43:25.270
You would say those things
about your best friend,

43:25.284 --> 43:26.750
to his wife?

43:26.785 --> 43:28.252
I think that you're confused.

43:28.287 --> 43:30.053
No. Stay... stay away from me.

43:30.089 --> 43:32.068
Jeannie. Jeannie.

43:32.093 --> 43:33.216
(Sobbing)

43:33.241 --> 43:35.108
- Jeannie, wait!
- Jim.

43:37.196 --> 43:39.782
- (Cheers and applause )
- They're starting.

43:40.490 --> 43:41.589
I'll handle this.

43:42.010 --> 43:43.267
What are you going to do?

43:43.302 --> 43:46.436

44:08.994 --> 44:12.229

obliged to sit half a mile off.

44:16.035 --> 44:19.670
