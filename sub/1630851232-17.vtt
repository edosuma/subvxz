00:04.830 --> 00:06.528
<i>- Previously</i>
<i>on "New Amsterdam"...</i>

00:06.571 --> 00:08.051
Half our karaoke party
is missing.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.922
<i>Elizabeth.</i>

00:09.966 --> 00:11.837
- <i>Mia.</i>

00:11.881 --> 00:12.838
Now Trevor.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.016
Casey.

00:16.059 --> 00:17.800
- Ronnie,
pull the car over now.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.151
- Why is it just
those four missing?

00:21.195 --> 00:22.674
It's not just four.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.219
Helen!

00:45.262 --> 00:46.916
Helen.

00:46.959 --> 00:49.136
Hey, hey, Helen! Helen!

00:49.179 --> 00:50.876
Helen!

00:50.920 --> 00:53.096
Helen.

00:53.140 --> 00:55.881
Hey, Helen.
Talk to me.

00:55.925 --> 00:57.187
Helen, hey!

00:57.231 --> 00:59.015
Talk to me.
Helen, please.

01:00.321 --> 01:02.149
Hey, help!
I found her on the floor.

01:02.192 --> 01:03.585
It's, uh, shallow breathing.

01:03.628 --> 01:05.065
A weak pulse.

01:06.762 --> 01:07.806
- Get me a finger-stick

01:07.850 --> 01:08.894
blood sugar stat.

01:08.938 --> 01:09.982
Pupils equal round reactive.

01:10.026 --> 01:11.897
DTR's intact bilaterally.

01:25.433 --> 01:27.913
- Hi, this is Dr. Bloom
from New Amsterdam Hospital.

01:27.957 --> 01:30.220
I'm trying to track down
a veteran in your system.

01:30.264 --> 01:31.787
Uh, Ronnie Cooper.

01:31.830 --> 01:33.441
<i>Hi, this is Trevor.</i>

01:33.484 --> 01:34.398
<i>You know what to do.</i>

01:34.442 --> 01:35.704
Hi, Trevor, it's me.

01:35.747 --> 01:37.749
Would you please call me
as soon as you get this?

01:37.793 --> 01:41.797
I'm, uh,
I'm getting worried over here.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.103
Okay, thank you.
Bye-bye.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.196
This is her bike.

01:49.239 --> 01:52.982
Mia! Mia!

01:57.073 --> 01:58.335
All right, let's fan out.

01:58.379 --> 01:59.380
She's out here somewhere.

02:11.522 --> 02:13.089
- Uh, hello?
<i>- Ronnie?</i>

02:13.133 --> 02:14.960
Ronnie Cooper, where are you?

02:15.004 --> 02:16.919
- Do you need help?

02:16.962 --> 02:18.268
What a night.

02:18.312 --> 02:20.140
- Is Casey with you?
<i>- Casey?</i>

02:20.183 --> 02:21.793
I don't--

02:23.926 --> 02:25.928
- Who is this?
<i>- Dr. Lauren Bloom.</i>

02:25.971 --> 02:28.060
You were with my friend
Casey Acosta last night

02:28.104 --> 02:29.192
and now we can't find him.

02:29.236 --> 02:30.802
- Is he--is he with you?
- Uh, no, ma'am.

02:30.846 --> 02:34.458
We, uh...we kinda
got into it last night.

02:34.502 --> 02:36.504
And, uh,
we almost got into an accident

02:36.547 --> 02:38.897
<i>and he just bounced.</i>
<i>Who is this again?</i>

02:38.941 --> 02:41.422
- Dr. Lauren Bloom
from New Amsterdam Hospital.

02:41.465 --> 02:42.640
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

02:42.684 --> 02:46.078
I did--I did see Casey
last night.

02:46.122 --> 02:49.169
We, uh, we went for a drive.

02:49.212 --> 02:52.694
- A drive where?
<i>- Well, uh--</i>

02:52.737 --> 02:54.304
- What's wrong?
- Casey's missing.

02:54.348 --> 02:55.697
I'm going out to find him.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.916
- Out,
like out of the hospital?

02:57.960 --> 02:59.135
Then I'm going with you.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.616
Okay, is there any landmarks?

03:01.659 --> 03:03.183
Tell me where
you last were there.

03:03.226 --> 03:05.141
Mia! Mia!

03:06.490 --> 03:09.319
Hey, I got her.
I got her.

03:09.363 --> 03:10.668
- Damn it.
- Trauma?

03:10.712 --> 03:12.104
- Not that I can see,
but she's hypothermic

03:12.148 --> 03:13.193
and we gotta get her
out of here now.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.766
- Oh, my God!
- Oh.

03:21.810 --> 03:24.073
Make sure
we're the only ones here.

03:24.116 --> 03:26.031
Uh, Karen, come look at this.

03:26.075 --> 03:27.294
Oh, my God.

03:27.337 --> 03:28.904
- Ah-ah, just lie there.
Don't move.

03:28.947 --> 03:30.253
I'm calling an ambulance.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.081
- The apartment's all clear.
- Thank you.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.049
- Helen.

03:44.093 --> 03:45.660
- M--Max.

03:45.703 --> 03:47.705
Hey, easy.

03:47.749 --> 03:49.620
Easy, tiger.

03:49.664 --> 03:53.015
It hurts...

03:53.058 --> 03:54.930
everywhere.

03:54.973 --> 03:57.324
What happened?

03:57.367 --> 03:59.543
- We found Thanatophol
in your blood.

03:59.587 --> 04:01.806
Happened last night at the bar.

04:01.850 --> 04:04.026
- My drink was spiked?
- Not just yours.

04:04.069 --> 04:07.029
It happened to Wilder,
Trevor, Mia, Casey.

04:07.072 --> 04:08.639
- Oh, my God.
- We're getting the word out

04:08.683 --> 04:10.337
to everybody, but right now
you're my priority,

04:10.380 --> 04:13.296
which means
getting you fluids and rest.

04:13.340 --> 04:17.039
- Oh, I'd rest a lot easier
if my leg wasn't killing me.

04:17.082 --> 04:18.083
Which one?

04:18.127 --> 04:19.302
The left one.

04:24.829 --> 04:26.788
That bad?

04:26.831 --> 04:28.311
We got more of her labs back.

04:28.355 --> 04:29.573
Her D-dimer's high.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.271
So's your protein.

04:31.314 --> 04:32.446
You're at 12 grams
per deciliter.

04:32.489 --> 04:34.317
- What's--what's
my platelet count?

04:34.361 --> 04:38.103
Uh, you're down to 25,000.

04:38.147 --> 04:40.236
I am ripe for severe DIC.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.498
- You could have clots
everywhere.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.935
You need a body scan now.
Walsh, let's move.

04:43.979 --> 04:45.415
<i>- Doing great, babe.</i>

04:45.459 --> 04:46.938
You're almost done.

04:53.815 --> 04:54.859
How's it look?

05:02.302 --> 05:03.868
Max?

05:10.005 --> 05:11.702
Max, what do you see?

05:11.746 --> 05:14.618
<i>Please just--just tell me.</i>

05:14.662 --> 05:18.230
Uh, you have multiple clots.

05:18.274 --> 05:21.495
In multiple arteries.

05:24.933 --> 05:25.934
Where are they?

05:27.414 --> 05:29.285
Renal.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.461
<i>And hepatic.</i>

05:31.505 --> 05:33.463
- Two surgeries,
that's not too bad.

05:33.507 --> 05:34.551
And gastric.

05:37.032 --> 05:38.163
And ovarian.

05:40.514 --> 05:42.211
<i>And uterine.</i>

05:46.520 --> 05:50.175
So that's three more.

05:50.219 --> 05:52.047
Including a hysterectomy.

05:54.484 --> 05:56.051
Yeah.

06:06.888 --> 06:07.062
.

06:09.238 --> 06:10.935
<i>Hello?</i>

06:10.979 --> 06:12.850
- Trevor, hi.
Oh, my God.

06:12.894 --> 06:13.982
<i>Hey, boss.</i>

06:14.025 --> 06:15.244
- <i>Got your messages.</i>
- Yeah.

06:15.287 --> 06:16.419
Yeah.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.464
Uh, where are you?

06:17.507 --> 06:18.813
Baptist Hospital.

06:18.856 --> 06:19.944
I swear to you
I'm not cheating on you, mate.

06:19.988 --> 06:22.164
It's where
the paramedics took me.

06:22.207 --> 06:23.383
So I'm sure you know by now

06:23.426 --> 06:24.601
that you were drugged
last night.

06:24.645 --> 06:25.994
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Wasn't just you though.

06:26.037 --> 06:27.691
A bunch of us got dosed
unfortunately.

06:27.735 --> 06:28.953
<i>- Damn.</i>
<i>The last thing I recall</i>

06:28.997 --> 06:30.433
<i>I was on the train home.</i>

06:30.477 --> 06:33.001
Good Samaritans found me
passed out like a real derro.

06:33.044 --> 06:35.220
They called 911 and I'm here.

06:35.264 --> 06:36.526
- And are you hurt?
Are you okay?

06:36.570 --> 06:37.527
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

06:37.571 --> 06:39.007
I'm fine.
I promise.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.095
Thank you for checking up
on me.

06:40.138 --> 06:41.749
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, of course.

06:41.792 --> 06:44.360
I've been, you know,
I've been really worried.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.753
Uh, mind has been racing.

06:45.796 --> 06:48.495
Can I ask, um...

06:48.538 --> 06:50.410
one thing?
Uh.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.455
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- This is gonna sound stupid.

06:52.499 --> 06:55.676
<i>I have a little bit</i>
<i>of the old brain fog myself</i>

06:55.719 --> 06:58.635
from the uh, you know...

06:58.679 --> 07:00.985
Did, uh...

07:01.029 --> 07:04.685
did anything happen last night?

07:07.209 --> 07:08.689
Happen?

07:10.386 --> 07:13.084
Yeah, happen.

07:13.128 --> 07:15.870
You know,
anything less than professional

07:15.913 --> 07:17.524
between you and I?

07:19.961 --> 07:22.529
- Sounds like you got it worse
than me, mate.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.226
Nothing happened.

07:24.269 --> 07:25.575
Nothing?

07:25.619 --> 07:27.098
Some rocking karaoke,

07:27.142 --> 07:28.796
<i>lovely late-night</i>
<i>conversation.</i>

07:28.839 --> 07:30.711
That was it.
We parted ways.

07:30.754 --> 07:32.277
And, uh, that's it?

07:32.321 --> 07:33.496
<i>That's it.</i>

07:34.845 --> 07:36.412
- Oh, well, that's good.
<i>- Yes.</i>

07:36.456 --> 07:37.848
- That's good.
That's, uh, great.

07:37.892 --> 07:40.155
I mean, all, you know,
all druggings aside.

07:40.198 --> 07:41.330
<i>Yes.</i>

07:41.373 --> 07:42.984
- Okay, well, you rest up
and feel better.

07:43.027 --> 07:45.029
And, uh, just let me know
when they release you, okay?

07:45.073 --> 07:46.944
<i>- Right-o.</i>
- Okay.

07:46.988 --> 07:48.468
- Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

08:01.002 --> 08:02.307
Hey, babe.
What are you--

08:04.222 --> 08:05.789
- Sameera has
her parent-teacher conference

08:05.833 --> 08:07.748
- tonight.
- Yeah. Yes, of course.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.445
Yeah, yeah, I, um.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.448
Yeah, I didn't forget.
I just--it's been a crazy day.

08:14.276 --> 08:15.756
I, uh...

08:22.414 --> 08:24.504
Core temp's 79.

08:24.547 --> 08:27.245
- Here, grab the far end
of this warming blanket.

08:27.289 --> 08:29.030
Hook her up
to a Level 1 rapid infuser.

08:29.073 --> 08:30.945
She'll need Amp, Gent,
and Dranova.

08:30.988 --> 08:32.903
- Not Dranova.
Chart says she's allergic.

08:32.947 --> 08:35.558
- Severe flushing.
- Well, make it Vancomycin.

08:35.602 --> 08:36.646
Watch it.

08:43.479 --> 08:44.915
All right, she's okay.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.264
All right, look, everyone,

08:46.308 --> 08:48.136
we're gonna have
to be very careful, all right?

08:48.179 --> 08:50.138
Just one bump could stop
her heart.

08:50.181 --> 08:53.228
And we won't be able to restart
it until she's warmed up.

08:53.271 --> 08:54.534
Okay?

08:56.274 --> 08:59.539
- I'm not having
a hysterectomy.

08:59.582 --> 09:00.975
Your uterus could rupture.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.846
Yes, I know.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.195
I know
that the clots are a problem

09:04.239 --> 09:06.197
and that I have to do something
about them.

09:06.241 --> 09:08.852
But I wanna try something
less invasive.

09:08.896 --> 09:10.593
I'm gonna try
and break them up,

09:10.637 --> 09:13.378
so can you put me on a regimen
of Platazel?

09:13.422 --> 09:16.643
- Platazel could lead
to uncontrollable bleeding.

09:16.686 --> 09:19.254
- As a hematologist,
I am aware of the risk.

09:19.297 --> 09:22.039
- Yeah, and this seems like
an unnecessary one.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.259
And surgery would mitigate
a lot of these issues.

09:24.302 --> 09:26.827
- Yeah, and it will
permanently change my body

09:26.870 --> 09:28.132
in dozens of ways.

09:28.176 --> 09:30.221
I'm on your side.

09:33.877 --> 09:36.880
I'm on your side.

09:36.924 --> 09:38.578
I know.

09:38.621 --> 09:42.016
A hysterectomy.

09:42.059 --> 09:46.194
That's gonna permanently
change my future.

09:46.237 --> 09:50.198
It's gonna change
my personality.

09:50.241 --> 09:54.158
And I can't help but think
of the fact

09:54.202 --> 09:56.204
that hysterectomies,

09:56.247 --> 09:59.163
they've been overperformed
for decades

09:59.207 --> 10:01.818
on people who look like me.

10:03.646 --> 10:06.214
'Cause if we're talking
about risks,

10:06.257 --> 10:08.085
well, that's feeling
pretty risky to me.

10:08.129 --> 10:10.697
And none of that
is gonna be mitigated.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.350
I hear you.

10:12.394 --> 10:15.440
I do, but we're talking
about your case.

10:15.484 --> 10:17.399
Your body had
an extreme reaction

10:17.442 --> 10:20.924
to the Thanatophol,
and you wanna add Platazel,

10:20.968 --> 10:23.231
which is long-acting.

10:23.274 --> 10:26.016
And if it doesn't work,
then we're gonna have

10:26.060 --> 10:27.714
to rush you
into an even riskier surgery.

10:27.757 --> 10:29.193
- Max, please.
- And I don't wanna do that.

10:29.237 --> 10:32.109
Please don't be my doctor.

10:32.153 --> 10:34.721
Be my partner.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.958
That should do it.

10:56.438 --> 10:58.919
Thanatophol. Oh, my God.

10:58.962 --> 11:01.225
What is that?

11:01.269 --> 11:03.488
It's like a roofie on steroids.

11:03.532 --> 11:07.536
- Someone really wanted
to knock you all on your asses.

11:07.579 --> 11:09.930
- Or kill us.
- Who would do this?

11:09.973 --> 11:12.628
I'm calling the police.
You rest.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.022
- I'm gonna order a CT scan
of your head.

11:15.065 --> 11:17.285
Be right back.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.959
- Yes.
That's right, officer.

11:39.002 --> 11:40.700
Thank you.

11:46.836 --> 11:47.968
Elizabeth?

11:49.752 --> 11:51.058
You think he's near here?

11:51.101 --> 11:53.538
- This is where his idiot
friend said he left him.

11:53.582 --> 11:55.149
Casey!

11:55.192 --> 11:58.239
Okay, uh, let's just look
for any sign of him.

11:58.282 --> 12:00.502
His wallet is like old,
and brown, and crappy,

12:00.545 --> 12:03.810
and his phone is like
from 2017.

12:03.853 --> 12:05.246
Lauren, we'll find him, okay?

12:07.248 --> 12:09.206
Yeah, okay.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.169
So talk to me.

12:15.212 --> 12:16.344
What's going on with your visa?

12:16.387 --> 12:17.867
You don't wanna know.

12:17.911 --> 12:19.521
Of course I do.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.526
- There was a glitch
in my paperwork.

12:24.569 --> 12:26.136
And I never got any
of the notices

12:26.180 --> 12:28.965
because I was living in my car.

12:29.009 --> 12:31.881
And in the middle of all that,
my case officer changed.

12:33.796 --> 12:37.713
Bottom line, my refugee status
is being revoked.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.542
And if I don't fight it,
I'll be sent back to Pakistan.

12:40.585 --> 12:43.023
- You need to contact
Legal Aid immediately

12:43.066 --> 12:44.894
- and tell them.
- I did.

12:44.938 --> 12:45.939
They're backed up for years.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.027
Pro bono programs?

12:47.070 --> 12:48.158
Same.

12:48.202 --> 12:49.464
With the new laws,

12:49.507 --> 12:51.771
I'm not the only one
this is happening to.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.903
Leyla, you need a lawyer.

12:56.036 --> 12:57.951
I know.

12:57.994 --> 13:00.301
I know, I know, but just...

13:07.395 --> 13:09.049
How much do you need?

13:11.921 --> 13:14.794
$10,000.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.578
Just for the retainer.

13:19.189 --> 13:21.278
And then
another $10,000 a month.

13:25.935 --> 13:28.372
I hate to ask you.

13:28.416 --> 13:29.939
I don't know who else.

13:35.466 --> 13:36.816
Is that his UMI ID?

13:48.566 --> 13:50.612
Lauren!

13:50.655 --> 13:53.310
Casey!

13:53.354 --> 13:55.835
Casey, Casey.

13:55.878 --> 13:58.098
Oh, God.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.578
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

14:00.622 --> 14:01.579
Oh, God.

14:03.886 --> 14:04.104
.

14:04.147 --> 14:06.541
- Okay, it looks like
the screwdriver sealed up

14:06.584 --> 14:07.455
- the wound, thank God.
- Pulse is thready.

14:07.498 --> 14:08.412
Feeling like 45 beats a minute.

14:08.456 --> 14:09.718
Okay, that's something.

14:09.761 --> 14:11.502
Casey?
Casey, can you hear me?

14:11.546 --> 14:13.722
No, no. Just get away.

14:13.765 --> 14:15.506
- No, no, no, no!
Damn it, damn it!

14:15.550 --> 14:16.943
- Oh, my God.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.945
- He's bleeding out.
- I need a suture.

14:18.988 --> 14:21.643
Anything.
Anything to seal up the wound.

14:22.731 --> 14:23.950
- Okay.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.168
I need you to stay still,
buddy.

14:25.212 --> 14:27.344
Okay?

14:27.388 --> 14:28.476
Okay.

14:28.519 --> 14:30.347
- You find anything?
- Not yet!

14:31.871 --> 14:33.873
- What the hell happened
to you?

14:33.916 --> 14:34.961
Mugged.

14:35.004 --> 14:36.179
- Okay, you know
there are easier ways

14:36.223 --> 14:38.355
to get a day off, right?

14:38.399 --> 14:40.662
Found something.

14:40.705 --> 14:42.185
- Good.
- Cardboard.

14:42.229 --> 14:45.493
Egg crate foam, and...

14:45.536 --> 14:46.494
A caulking gun?

14:46.537 --> 14:49.366
It works on tiles.

14:49.410 --> 14:50.759
What the hell?

14:50.802 --> 14:53.240
Here goes nothing.

14:53.283 --> 14:54.371
Okay.

14:54.415 --> 14:57.766
Releasing in one, two, three.

14:59.594 --> 15:01.378
- Okay.

15:01.422 --> 15:03.250
- Okay, I just need
to get in that hole.

15:05.774 --> 15:07.776
- Got it.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.082
Well, the bleeding's stopped.

15:09.996 --> 15:12.215
- For now.
Call 911.

15:12.259 --> 15:13.260
Okay.

15:13.303 --> 15:14.609
You're gonna be okay.

15:16.828 --> 15:18.352
- Come on.
Stay with me, buddy.

15:18.395 --> 15:20.223
Come on.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.272
- Mr. Higbee says, "If you're
not early, you're late."

15:25.315 --> 15:27.752
- Oh, Mr. Higbee sounds like
a real stickler.

15:27.796 --> 15:29.929
- We'll make it in time, hon.
Don't worry.

15:31.843 --> 15:33.193
- Hey, nothing happened.
Okay?

15:33.236 --> 15:36.239
- Uh, our daughter is ten feet
in front of us.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.893
I know.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.113
I'm just saying that whatever
you think you overheard

15:40.156 --> 15:42.506
back there, it was not
what it sounded like, okay?

15:42.550 --> 15:43.768
- No?
- No, no, no.

15:43.812 --> 15:45.857
- 'Cause it sounded like
you hired Trevor,

15:45.901 --> 15:48.077
the guy who hit on you
during his interview,

15:48.121 --> 15:50.688
the guy we both agreed
you shouldn't hire.

15:50.732 --> 15:52.081
Okay, yeah.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.822
That--that part is exactly
what it sounded like.

15:53.865 --> 15:55.867
- But the rest of it--
- Stop. Just stop.

15:55.911 --> 15:57.826
- Honey, please--
- No, no, I am not gonna have

15:57.869 --> 16:00.263
a conversation with you
about your infidelity

16:00.307 --> 16:03.788
out on the street between here
and PS 144, so just park it.

16:03.832 --> 16:05.921
If not for me,
then for our daughter.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.967
Hurry up, you slowpokes.

16:08.010 --> 16:10.621
Hey, coming, hon.

16:17.672 --> 16:18.760
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:18.803 --> 16:21.197
We should talk.

16:21.241 --> 16:24.026
Yeah.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.550
Uh.

16:26.594 --> 16:27.769
Whew.

16:27.812 --> 16:29.292
Where to begin?

16:29.336 --> 16:31.860
I don't know.

16:31.903 --> 16:34.819
I just found out.

16:34.863 --> 16:37.039
I've been spinning and I--

16:37.083 --> 16:39.433
Look, since the baby's mine,

16:39.476 --> 16:42.262
then I think it's only right

16:42.305 --> 16:46.701
that you and I raise the child
together.

16:46.744 --> 16:49.008
Claude can take the job
in Denver

16:49.051 --> 16:51.532
and, you know,
we can stay together.

16:51.575 --> 16:53.273
Floyd...

16:57.712 --> 17:01.585
I'm not leaving Claude.

17:01.629 --> 17:03.413
Right.

17:03.457 --> 17:06.808
I mean...

17:06.851 --> 17:09.202
is there any way

17:09.245 --> 17:12.814
the three of us
could raise the baby together?

17:12.857 --> 17:14.381
And what, I move to Denver?

17:14.424 --> 17:18.080
Would we go to church together?

17:18.124 --> 17:20.648
- Thanksgivings?

17:20.691 --> 17:22.302
That does sound--

17:22.345 --> 17:23.694
Yeah, crazy.

17:23.738 --> 17:26.045
Yeah.

17:28.438 --> 17:31.050
I mean,

17:31.093 --> 17:34.053
Claude and I could
raise the baby without--

17:34.096 --> 17:37.404
- No, no, mm-mm.
Definitely not.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.495
Yeah, I didn't think so.

17:41.538 --> 17:44.193
I just, you know,
I had to--

17:44.237 --> 17:46.065
- I had to--
- Any other options?

17:50.112 --> 17:53.637
I mean, I could, um...

17:53.681 --> 17:55.900
I could terminate
the pregnancy.

17:58.686 --> 18:02.385
Then there would be nothing
tying us together.

18:05.432 --> 18:08.696
Do you want that?

18:08.739 --> 18:10.263
No.

18:12.047 --> 18:16.834
This baby is a miracle.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.582
- Then where do we go
from here?

18:32.546 --> 18:36.027
- So I just spoke to Dr. Malvo,
who told me

18:36.071 --> 18:39.814
that the clot busting
is working.

18:39.857 --> 18:41.250
Yeah.

18:41.294 --> 18:43.818
- Yeah.
You don't seem, uh, elated.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.345
- It's just
this isn't quite how I imagined

18:49.389 --> 18:52.348
our first ultrasound
as a couple.

18:52.392 --> 18:53.697
Yeah.

18:53.741 --> 18:55.612
Totally thought
it would be your gallbladder.

19:03.664 --> 19:05.535
Look, I know
that we haven't discussed this,

19:05.579 --> 19:07.972
and I don't mean
to just spring it on you--

19:08.016 --> 19:10.018
I wanna have a baby with you.

19:21.247 --> 19:26.861
- I mean, who even knows
if it's possible.

19:26.904 --> 19:28.515
Frozen eggs.
Your cancer.

19:28.558 --> 19:29.820
- Let's not go there right now.
- My--

19:29.864 --> 19:32.562
- Let's just live
in the possibility.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.003
- Luna would love it.

19:39.047 --> 19:41.484
Big sister, are you kidding?

19:41.528 --> 19:44.226
- And we already have like
a million baby clothes.

19:44.270 --> 19:45.793
- Yeah, and a crib.
Got that.

19:45.836 --> 19:47.490
- The baby practically
pays for itself.

19:47.534 --> 19:50.754
- Yeah, and this baby would be
a little mini-you,

19:50.798 --> 19:53.670
so, you know,
freaking adorable.

19:58.240 --> 20:01.200
I had a whole plan.

20:01.243 --> 20:02.984
I had a whole plan
to propose to you.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.814
- Excuse me?
- Mm-hmm.

20:06.857 --> 20:08.381
Nice reservations
at this fancy restaurant

20:08.424 --> 20:09.382
and a walk through
New York City

20:09.425 --> 20:10.600
in the moonlight
and everything.

20:10.644 --> 20:11.514
You know, I even got a ring.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.693
- Max?
- But--

20:16.737 --> 20:17.738
Screw it.

20:20.001 --> 20:21.829
Maybe this place
is as good as any.

20:24.266 --> 20:27.487
Will you make me
the happiest man

20:27.530 --> 20:29.967
in this whole ICU?

20:33.144 --> 20:34.145
Will you marry me?

20:34.189 --> 20:36.974
Yes.

20:37.018 --> 20:41.501
Yes, yes, yes.

20:41.544 --> 20:43.764
Oh, my God.

20:43.807 --> 20:46.157
Wait, you--you got a ring?

20:46.201 --> 20:47.376
- Yeah, I got a ring.
I got a ring.

20:47.420 --> 20:49.335
It's nice.
Should I get it?

20:49.378 --> 20:50.510
- Yeah.
- I should?

20:50.553 --> 20:51.859
- I should go get it, okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

20:51.902 --> 20:52.773
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
I'm gonna get it.

20:52.816 --> 20:54.165
I'm getting the ring.

20:54.209 --> 20:57.125
- Yeah.

21:05.916 --> 21:06.090
.

21:06.134 --> 21:07.570
<i>Okay, so somehow</i>

21:07.614 --> 21:09.137
<i>this is now my fault?</i>

21:09.180 --> 21:10.486
<i>- I'm not--no, I didn't.</i>
<i>I'm not saying that.</i>

21:10.530 --> 21:12.183
<i>Okay, and look, surprise.</i>

21:12.227 --> 21:13.924
<i>- Say that.</i>
<i>- He has once again steered</i>

21:13.968 --> 21:15.578
the fight away
from the real issue at hand.

21:15.622 --> 21:17.014
- The real issue?
- Yeah.

21:17.058 --> 21:18.581
- No, the real issue,
as I see it,

21:18.625 --> 21:21.497
is that you have
a ton of hot gay friends

21:21.541 --> 21:23.064
- and I have never once--
- What?

21:23.107 --> 21:24.674
- Insinuated that you might be
sleeping with one of them.

21:24.718 --> 21:25.936
But that's exactly
where you went with me.

21:25.980 --> 21:27.503
That's the first place
your mind went.

21:27.547 --> 21:29.331
- My friends' hotness
isn't a secret.

21:29.375 --> 21:32.334
You and I talk about
how guys look all the time.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.510
- Yes.
- Yet this guy has been

21:34.554 --> 21:36.033
in your life for months,

21:36.077 --> 21:38.906
yet you've never mentioned him
once.

21:38.949 --> 21:42.866
- Because...
it wasn't important.

21:42.910 --> 21:45.521
- And yet you go out with him
one night and the next morning

21:45.565 --> 21:46.740
you're worried something
might've happened

21:46.783 --> 21:48.089
- between the two of you.
- Because--

21:48.132 --> 21:50.309
- The roofies didn't put you
in that situation.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.267
- You did that all on your own.
- How can you--

21:52.311 --> 21:53.529
And that's infidelity, Iggy.

21:53.573 --> 21:55.226
Emotional infidelity.

21:55.270 --> 21:57.968
Stop using that word.

21:58.012 --> 22:01.015
I--it's banter.

22:01.058 --> 22:02.843
It's banter, Martin.

22:02.886 --> 22:03.974
Over coffee.

22:04.018 --> 22:06.455
That's the extent
of our relationship.

22:06.499 --> 22:07.761
All right?

22:07.804 --> 22:09.240
I don't even know
the guy's last name.

22:09.284 --> 22:12.896
Does it bring me pleasure
that this handsome guy

22:12.940 --> 22:14.898
flirts with me?
Yeah, sure, I'm a human being.

22:14.942 --> 22:17.292
- But it's harmless.
- But it isn't harmless!

22:19.512 --> 22:21.775
Lower your voice.

22:21.818 --> 22:23.080
You're gonna scare the kids.

22:23.124 --> 22:25.909
Jesus.

22:25.953 --> 22:27.737
- You've been different
these past few weeks.

22:27.781 --> 22:29.870
I've noticed it.
The kids have noticed it.

22:29.913 --> 22:33.482
- No.
- You've been happier.

22:33.526 --> 22:36.398
And I just assumed
it was you getting back

22:36.442 --> 22:37.530
in the saddle again.

22:37.573 --> 22:43.187
Finding joy
in this amazing life

22:43.231 --> 22:44.667
that we've built together.

22:47.627 --> 22:50.456
I even thought...

22:50.499 --> 22:52.196
maybe it was me.

22:54.764 --> 22:56.113
No, but the thing
that's been bringing you

22:56.157 --> 22:57.767
all this joy
these past few weeks

22:57.811 --> 22:59.465
is flirting with another man
at work

22:59.508 --> 23:01.292
and then lying about it.

23:03.556 --> 23:06.297
Martin.

23:06.341 --> 23:08.952
That's...

23:08.996 --> 23:09.997
Come on.

23:12.695 --> 23:14.784
- If you still think
that's nothing,

23:14.828 --> 23:17.526
you're not just lying to me.

23:17.570 --> 23:19.310
Excuse me.
Someone's gotta start dinner.

23:33.934 --> 23:35.936
You're gonna be okay.

23:37.198 --> 23:40.462
- Don't do that.

23:40.506 --> 23:42.029
You know why
you're gonna be okay?

23:42.072 --> 23:46.686
Because I wore
a freaking taco hat for you

23:46.729 --> 23:48.514
and that can't be
the last humiliating thing

23:48.557 --> 23:51.342
that you make me do, okay?

23:53.562 --> 23:59.699
- It makes me really happy
to see you and Leyla together.

23:59.742 --> 24:03.485
- Yeah, I mean,
she's talking to me again.

24:03.529 --> 24:05.966
Voluntarily, so...

24:06.009 --> 24:07.184
yeah,
I feel pretty good about it.

24:07.228 --> 24:08.795
Wow.

24:08.838 --> 24:14.540
If I die, you're gonna feel
really bad about lying to me.

24:14.583 --> 24:16.498
You are not gonna die.

24:17.804 --> 24:21.285
My BP is 87/40.

24:21.329 --> 24:23.505
I've lost one
and a half units of blood

24:23.549 --> 24:24.941
and the only thing
that's keeping me

24:24.985 --> 24:26.769
from completely
bleeding out is...

24:26.813 --> 24:29.511
Plumber's caulk.

24:31.557 --> 24:35.648
If I was some random patient
that got wheeled into your ED,

24:35.691 --> 24:38.738
I don't think you'd be so sure
about how this is gonna go.

24:41.654 --> 24:44.439
Is that right?

24:44.483 --> 24:47.268
Just level with me here.

24:55.929 --> 24:59.672
- Leyla's immigration status
is in trouble

24:59.715 --> 25:02.283
and she has asked me for money.

25:02.326 --> 25:03.414
- Mm-hmm.

25:03.458 --> 25:05.199
Like a lot.

25:05.242 --> 25:09.377
- The good news
is you have a lot of it.

25:09.420 --> 25:13.860
- If I give it to her,
then she'll get to stay.

25:13.903 --> 25:16.253
But then our entire
relationship is transactional

25:16.297 --> 25:21.476
and eventually,
she's gonna resent me for it.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.000
And if you don't?

25:24.044 --> 25:26.699
- Well, then she's gonna have
to leave the country.

25:26.742 --> 25:28.352
And I'm never gonna see her
again.

25:28.396 --> 25:30.572
- Guess money doesn't solve
every problem.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.882
- That would appear
to be the case.

25:38.101 --> 25:40.277
- How many?
- Four times.

25:40.321 --> 25:41.757
Clear.

25:46.327 --> 25:48.764
Four, five, six, seven.

25:48.808 --> 25:49.852
- Okay, we're going again.
- Eight.

25:49.896 --> 25:51.332
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

25:51.375 --> 25:53.943
Her body temp's 92.
Still too cold.

25:53.987 --> 25:55.336
Look, her heart
is not going to restart

25:55.379 --> 25:57.077
until we get her
to a normal body temp.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.600
- That's what we've been doing.
- Well, we need fast acting.

25:58.644 --> 26:00.820
Five, six, seven.

26:00.863 --> 26:02.952
Let's get the 12 point ready.

26:02.996 --> 26:04.650
- Give her 10ccs of Dranova.
IV push.

26:04.693 --> 26:05.781
- Wait. No, wait.
No, no.

26:05.825 --> 26:07.391
It--she's allergic to Dranova.

26:07.435 --> 26:09.002
- An allergic reaction
will raise her body temp.

26:09.045 --> 26:11.482
- Yeah, or it'll kill her.
- So will arguing with me.

26:11.526 --> 26:12.614
Just do it.

26:26.236 --> 26:27.063
Your call, chief.

26:27.107 --> 26:30.414
Six, seven, eight, nine.

26:46.213 --> 26:47.693
Hey.

26:47.736 --> 26:49.695
Doc from last night,
what can I get you?

26:49.738 --> 26:51.522
Why?

26:51.566 --> 26:52.741
Why what?

26:54.656 --> 26:55.831
Hey!

26:55.875 --> 26:57.224
Lady, what the hell?

27:06.059 --> 27:07.103
Look, look, look.

27:07.147 --> 27:08.539
I don't know
what you're saying,

27:08.583 --> 27:10.106
but you gotta get out of here.

27:10.150 --> 27:11.151
Hey.

27:11.194 --> 27:12.543
- Stop! Stop!
- What?

27:12.587 --> 27:13.675
- Sto--
- Why?

27:13.719 --> 27:14.676
Okay, you wanna know why?

27:14.720 --> 27:16.199
Yeah.

27:18.506 --> 27:20.856
You doctors.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.379
Everybody says you're heroes.

27:22.423 --> 27:24.077
You're no hero, okay?

27:24.120 --> 27:26.427
I got COVID, and it was nothing
but a bad cold.

27:26.470 --> 27:29.343
But you doctors,
you exaggerated everything.

27:29.386 --> 27:31.562
You scared people.
You shut down businesses.

27:31.606 --> 27:33.782
I was outta work for 18 months!

27:33.826 --> 27:34.783
Because of you.

27:36.132 --> 27:39.614
- You didn't lose your job,
did you?

27:39.658 --> 27:42.704
You know what it's like to owe
a year of back rent, huh?

27:42.748 --> 27:43.792
Huh?

27:43.836 --> 27:45.881
Elizabeth?

27:45.925 --> 27:47.927
- Yeah. Yeah, I did it. I
drugged you

27:47.970 --> 27:49.232
and I hope you suffer
the same way I suffered!

27:49.276 --> 27:50.799
- Stop right there.
Stop right there.

27:50.843 --> 27:51.931
Back off.

27:51.974 --> 27:53.236
He did it!

27:53.280 --> 27:54.716
He...

27:54.760 --> 27:57.719
- Elizabeth?
Elizabeth!

27:57.763 --> 28:00.591
- Elizabeth.
- Call an ambulance.

28:03.290 --> 28:06.075
- Give me a tidal volume 700,
respiratory rate 12.

28:06.119 --> 28:07.598
- Lyn, what happened?
- And five PEEP.

28:07.642 --> 28:09.731
One of the clots broke free
and is lodged in her lung.

28:09.775 --> 28:12.473
We need to do an embolectomy
now or she's going to die.

28:18.305 --> 28:18.479
.

28:23.397 --> 28:24.354
- All right, it's working.

28:24.398 --> 28:25.747
Body temp's at 95.3.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.575
- She's in full anaphylactic
shock, Dr. Reynolds.

28:27.618 --> 28:29.490
We need to reverse
the allergic reaction now.

28:29.533 --> 28:32.319
- She's not warm enough for us
to shock her heart yet.

28:32.362 --> 28:33.886
Her airways are closing.

28:33.929 --> 28:35.235
Here, I'm reversing it.

28:35.278 --> 28:37.063
No, she's at 96.7, all right?

28:37.106 --> 28:38.064
She's getting there, Walsh.

28:38.107 --> 28:39.108
All right, she's getting there.

28:39.152 --> 28:40.501
O sats are tanking.

28:40.544 --> 28:42.459
- 98.
- This is killing her.

28:42.503 --> 28:44.766
- Come on.
Come on, Mia.

28:44.810 --> 28:45.724
- 99.
- Now!

28:45.767 --> 28:47.769
Paddles.
Clear.

28:53.122 --> 28:54.863
I'm going again.

28:54.907 --> 28:55.908
Clear.

29:06.483 --> 29:07.789
Got a pulse.

29:07.833 --> 29:10.226
EpiPen.

29:10.270 --> 29:11.793
Give her the EpiPen!
What are you waiting on?

29:16.319 --> 29:19.453
Airways clearing.

29:19.496 --> 29:22.412
O2 sats are rising.

29:22.456 --> 29:24.893
She's gonna make it.

29:26.329 --> 29:27.504
How 'bout you?

29:34.990 --> 29:38.777
Caulk?

29:38.820 --> 29:40.648
<i>- Yeah, seemed better than</i>
<i>a hammer and nails.</i>

29:43.782 --> 29:45.000
<i>Jeez,</i>
<i>no one in this department</i>

29:45.044 --> 29:46.741
<i>got a sense of humor?</i>

29:46.785 --> 29:51.137
- And looks like
the carotid artery's intact.

29:51.180 --> 29:52.747
That's a relief.

30:03.366 --> 30:06.848
I'm so sorry.

30:06.892 --> 30:12.419
I swear I'm not trying to take
advantage of your feelings or--

30:12.462 --> 30:14.290
- I would never think
that about you.

30:16.640 --> 30:21.602
Things between us
are complicated.

30:21.645 --> 30:22.690
Over.

30:25.214 --> 30:26.433
But I'm in awe of you.

30:28.565 --> 30:31.394
Starting out in a new country.

30:31.438 --> 30:33.744
Never backing down.

30:33.788 --> 30:38.271
Even when faced with obstacles
that would probably break me.

30:41.927 --> 30:43.885
I love you.

30:43.929 --> 30:48.281
And not just in the way that
I know that I need to get over.

30:51.110 --> 30:54.113
I love you as a person.

30:54.156 --> 30:57.290
And I wanna do whatever I can
to help you be that person.

31:00.771 --> 31:02.817
I'll give you whatever money
you need.

31:06.603 --> 31:07.909
Thank you, Lauren.

31:09.824 --> 31:12.914
Thank you so much.

31:12.958 --> 31:14.089
Thank you.

31:14.133 --> 31:16.048
<i>- Advancing</i>
<i>the embolectomy catheter</i>

31:16.091 --> 31:18.050
through the subclavian artery.

31:22.445 --> 31:23.969
Headed for the right atrium.

31:27.494 --> 31:28.756
Oxygenation's falling.

31:28.799 --> 31:30.366
You gotta get the clot
out of her lungs.

31:30.410 --> 31:32.760
- And smoothly through
the tricuspid valve.

31:32.803 --> 31:34.109
- Careful, careful.
You're touching the wall

31:34.153 --> 31:35.415
- of the right ventricle.
- I'm pulling back.

31:35.458 --> 31:36.982
No, push through.

31:37.025 --> 31:38.897
The only way to get
to that clot is to push through

31:38.940 --> 31:40.768
- the heart.
- If I advance any further,

31:40.811 --> 31:42.248
she could have
a cardiac arrest.

31:42.291 --> 31:43.162
- If you don't
get that clot out,

31:43.205 --> 31:45.468
she's not gonna make it.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.211
If her heart stops,
I'll restart it.

31:49.255 --> 31:50.343
- You'll only have
a few seconds.

31:51.997 --> 31:55.435
- I know. I'm ready.
I'm not gonna lose her.

31:55.478 --> 31:56.436
Advancing catheter.

32:02.007 --> 32:03.182
It's all right.

32:03.225 --> 32:05.271
Just a few irregular beats.

32:05.314 --> 32:07.099
You got it.

32:12.756 --> 32:13.975
Made it.

32:16.108 --> 32:17.674
I'm at the clot.

32:17.718 --> 32:21.940
Activating embolectomy.

32:21.983 --> 32:23.942
Okay, got it.

32:23.985 --> 32:27.902
- Oxygenation is stabilizing.
That's...

32:27.946 --> 32:29.121
that's great, Lyn.

32:29.164 --> 32:31.340
Now comes the hard part.

32:31.384 --> 32:33.647
The catheter's gotta go out
the way it came.

32:33.690 --> 32:36.302
- Ready?
- Yeah.

32:36.345 --> 32:39.044
Out of the lung.

32:39.087 --> 32:42.569
Approaching the heart.

32:42.612 --> 32:44.527
And through the pulmonic valve.

32:47.182 --> 32:48.531
- V-fib arrest.

32:54.363 --> 32:55.974
- Normal pulse.

32:56.017 --> 32:57.976
Good rhythm.

32:58.019 --> 32:59.020
And the catheter?

32:59.064 --> 33:00.500
It's out.

33:10.379 --> 33:11.554
That was close.

33:11.598 --> 33:13.469
She made it.

33:13.513 --> 33:15.950
- She's gonna be okay.
- Thank you, Lyn.

33:23.175 --> 33:25.046
Mm.

33:28.397 --> 33:30.704
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:30.747 --> 33:32.227
Surgeon says
you're gonna be fine.

33:32.271 --> 33:33.881
Be out of here in no time.

33:33.924 --> 33:37.580
- But, uh, going back
and confronting the bartender

33:37.624 --> 33:39.887
all by yourself...

33:39.930 --> 33:41.845
is not one of your best ideas.

33:46.285 --> 33:48.200
When did everything change?

33:48.243 --> 33:50.854
What?

33:50.898 --> 33:53.379
- Do you remember
the--the parades?

33:55.120 --> 33:59.080
- Celebrating
healthcare workers.

33:59.124 --> 34:03.563
Spontaneous applause throughout
the city every night.

34:03.606 --> 34:05.956
- And now.
- And now.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.091
The hospital is full
of unvaccinated people

34:10.135 --> 34:11.962
who hate us.

34:14.182 --> 34:15.923
We've become the enemy.

34:15.966 --> 34:19.231
- For trying.
- For trying to help.

34:19.274 --> 34:20.493
I know.

34:25.715 --> 34:29.980
- I used to wear my scrubs
home from work.

34:32.896 --> 34:37.597
Now before I walk home,

34:37.640 --> 34:40.774
I put on regular clothes.

34:40.817 --> 34:44.386
I don't want people to know
that I'm a doctor.

34:44.430 --> 34:46.432
Because...

34:49.565 --> 34:53.265
- Because I'm afraid
that I will be attacked.

34:59.575 --> 35:00.794
How can I...

35:00.837 --> 35:04.189
- How can I--can I have hope

35:04.232 --> 35:08.062
in a world like this?

35:08.106 --> 35:10.456
I'm sorry, kid.

35:10.499 --> 35:12.980
But you're the hope.

35:13.023 --> 35:14.677
It's just you.

35:14.721 --> 35:16.679
That's all you got.

35:37.700 --> 35:40.660
- I heard
you saved Helen's life.

35:40.703 --> 35:42.183
I heard you saved Mia's.

35:56.284 --> 35:59.374
You know, my, uh...

35:59.418 --> 36:02.464
dad wasn't around much.

36:05.815 --> 36:09.558
My mom raised me and...

36:09.602 --> 36:10.603
Believe me,

36:10.646 --> 36:13.258
she's a force, but...

36:13.301 --> 36:18.654
somehow it was my dad
who made me who I am

36:18.698 --> 36:21.222
through his absence.

36:21.266 --> 36:23.877
You know?

36:23.920 --> 36:26.749
And because of that,

36:26.793 --> 36:31.232
I so want to be a father.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.582
A good father.

36:35.541 --> 36:40.023
I mean, it's shaped...

36:40.067 --> 36:42.548
everything I am.

36:42.591 --> 36:44.941
Everything I've done.

36:48.249 --> 36:54.124
So there's no way I could
abandon my own child.

37:03.090 --> 37:10.097
But if that child
had you and Claude...

37:12.012 --> 37:15.450
I wouldn't be abandoning
that child at all.

37:20.716 --> 37:22.544
'Cause they would have
a wonderful mother.

37:25.765 --> 37:27.767
And a wonderful father.

37:31.988 --> 37:36.123
And be raised in a home
filled with joy and love.

37:40.997 --> 37:44.740
- Floyd, are you saying--
- I just ask

37:44.784 --> 37:46.307
that when the time is right...

37:49.267 --> 37:52.748
I get to tell our child
who I am.

37:57.666 --> 37:59.625
I get to be in their life.

38:15.205 --> 38:18.339
'Cause I just--
I just want them to know

38:18.383 --> 38:22.778
that we were united in love.

38:25.868 --> 38:29.568
Trying to make something
bigger and better

38:29.611 --> 38:31.483
than our parents did.

38:37.837 --> 38:39.360
It didn't work out for us.

38:43.538 --> 38:45.627
But look what did work.

38:46.933 --> 38:48.543
A little miracle.

38:50.893 --> 38:53.679
Just like you said.

40:51.361 --> 40:54.016
There she is.

40:55.757 --> 40:56.889
Hey.

40:59.021 --> 41:00.370
They got the clots.

41:01.763 --> 41:03.025
They got all of them.

41:05.898 --> 41:08.640
Now that that is out
of the way,

41:08.683 --> 41:11.686
I, um...

41:11.730 --> 41:13.514
I got you this.

41:20.652 --> 41:24.046
I had it made just for you.

41:32.533 --> 41:36.755
- Mm.

41:42.674 --> 41:45.459
Hm.

41:45.503 --> 41:48.549
What?

41:53.902 --> 41:56.165
- Hm.
- What is it?

41:56.209 --> 41:59.560
S-s-s-speak.

41:59.604 --> 42:04.478
C-c-c-can't...

42:04.522 --> 42:07.525
C-c-c...

42:07.568 --> 42:09.744
C-c-can't...

42:11.616 --> 42:14.444
- Hey.

42:14.488 --> 42:15.576
It's okay.

42:15.620 --> 42:17.317
It's okay, it's okay.

42:17.360 --> 42:19.580
- Hey!
