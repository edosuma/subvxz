01:03.981 --> 01:06.111
- Lunch is almost up, honey.
- Okay.

01:25.836 --> 01:26.836
Hmm.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.500
Yes?

02:06.585 --> 02:07.745
I thought it wasn't a date.

02:07.837 --> 02:09.757
It wasn't, and it isn't.

02:09.839 --> 02:12.879
Thought you said he was just another
smooth-talking brother.

02:12.967 --> 02:16.387
Going to an awful lot of trouble
for just another smooth-talker.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.890
Mom, you know I try to look my best

02:18.973 --> 02:21.393
no matter where I go
or who I'm going with.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.481
It's fun to look pretty.

02:26.939 --> 02:29.609
- He's a colleague.
- Okay, if you say so.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.509
- Hello?
- Hi, Bar.

02:51.589 --> 02:53.169
Aren't you supposed to be on your date?

02:53.924 --> 02:56.474
I've got a few minutes
before I need to leave.

02:57.011 --> 02:59.100
You're not checking up on me now,
are you, Toot?

02:59.180 --> 03:00.220
Well, maybe I am.

03:00.306 --> 03:03.016
But it's a grandmother's God-given right.

03:03.100 --> 03:06.398
You have a bad habit of being late,
and if you're late to the first date,

03:06.478 --> 03:08.608
I can promise you there won't be a second.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.279
I won't be late. I appreciate it.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.316
- How's Gramps?
- How's Gramps? He's Gramps.

03:15.279 --> 03:17.909
He's got his bridge game
on Tuesdays and Thursdays,

03:17.990 --> 03:20.660
golf on the weekends,
but when he's home and bored,

03:20.743 --> 03:22.748
well, what can I say, Bar,
he drives me up the wall.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.714
- Well, thank you, baby.
- Of course.

03:35.341 --> 03:38.139
So, where you going looking so raggedy?

03:38.219 --> 03:40.969
- Girl's got herself a date.
- Mm.

03:41.055 --> 03:42.845
It's not a date, Daddy.

03:42.932 --> 03:47.064
He's the summer associate I told y'all
about, the one from Harvard Law.

03:47.144 --> 03:51.861
I mentioned I worked legal aid,
and he invited me to a community event

03:51.941 --> 03:53.441
- at the Gardens.
- Huh?

03:53.525 --> 03:55.395
Yeah, 'cause it doesn't get more romantic

03:55.486 --> 03:58.316
than broken plumbing
and underfunded schools.

04:00.032 --> 04:02.121
TAnd tell me the young lady's name again.

04:02.201 --> 04:03.911
Michelle Robinson.

04:03.994 --> 04:06.164
She's my advisor at the firm, remember?

04:06.247 --> 04:08.037
And tell me again what she looks like.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.036
Well, she's tall.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.496
Ah. What else?

04:12.586 --> 04:14.046
What else would you like to know?

04:14.129 --> 04:16.418
Well, where's she from?

04:16.507 --> 04:17.627
Chicago.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.886
Uh-huh. Which part?

04:19.969 --> 04:21.548
The side that's predominantly black.

04:21.637 --> 04:23.177
Okay, so she's...

04:23.264 --> 04:26.312
Yes, Toot, her skin is
of the darker persuasion.

04:26.392 --> 04:27.432
Good.

04:27.518 --> 04:29.938
So long as you're happy, Bar,
that's all that really matters.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.270
Thanks, Toot.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.185
Now, I gotta go, or I will be late.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.778
Okay, love you.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.488
I love you, too.

04:38.570 --> 04:41.320
- So, what's this boy's name?
- Barack Obama.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.202
Barack-a-what-a?

04:43.284 --> 04:44.330
He's half-white.

04:45.494 --> 04:48.964
His father's from Kenya
and his mother's white.

04:49.665 --> 04:52.415
So, why isn't this a date?

04:53.168 --> 04:55.248
We work together. It's inappropriate.

04:55.337 --> 04:58.757
Mm. Maybe, but you are
spending the day with him.

04:58.841 --> 05:01.181
Yeah, the meeting sounded interesting.

05:02.094 --> 05:04.600
Well, even if it's not a date,

05:04.680 --> 05:08.057
the least thing you could've done
is run a brush through your hair.

05:13.397 --> 05:14.977
You look real nice, Meesh.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.150
Thank you, Daddy.

05:26.243 --> 05:27.790
This heat, this heat, this heat!

05:27.870 --> 05:29.959
Hey, uh, women wearing the freeze hairdos,

05:30.039 --> 05:31.959
y'all doing that to keep cool
during the summer?

05:32.041 --> 05:33.420
Sounds like a plan to me.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.670
What are you doing to keep cool?

05:34.752 --> 05:36.590
What are you doing to beat this heat?

05:36.670 --> 05:38.590
Speaking of hot, hot, hot!

05:38.672 --> 05:41.378
Janet's bring the heat
with the number one single in the country.

05:41.467 --> 05:43.467
I miss it so much when I don't hear it.

05:43.552 --> 05:44.722
I know you do, too.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.642
So I'm playing it for me and for you.

06:32.101 --> 06:34.021
# Shot #

06:34.728 --> 06:38.268
# Like an arrow going through my heart #

06:38.941 --> 06:41.861
# That's the pain I feel #

06:42.945 --> 06:46.615
# I feel whenever we're apart #

06:47.282 --> 06:51.122
# Not to say that I'm in love with you #

06:51.203 --> 06:54.043
# But who's to say that I'm not? #

06:55.499 --> 06:58.629
# I just know that it feels wrong #

06:58.710 --> 07:00.750
# When I'm away too long #

07:00.838 --> 07:03.718
# It makes my body hot #

07:03.799 --> 07:05.839
# So let me tell ya, baby #

07:05.926 --> 07:07.966
# I'll tell your mama #

07:08.053 --> 07:10.263
# I'll tell your friends #

07:10.347 --> 07:13.727
# I'll tell anyone whose heart
can comprehend #

07:13.809 --> 07:16.059
# Send it in a letter, baby #

07:16.145 --> 07:18.355
# Tell you on the phone #

07:18.439 --> 07:21.689
# I'm not the kind of girl
who likes to be alone #

07:21.775 --> 07:23.485
# I miss you much #

07:23.569 --> 07:25.609
# Oh, boy, I miss you much #

07:25.696 --> 07:27.656
# I really miss you much #

07:27.739 --> 07:29.869
# M-I-S-S you much #

07:29.950 --> 07:33.660
# I miss you much, baby #

07:33.745 --> 07:35.825
# I really miss you much #

07:35.914 --> 07:38.712
# M-I-S-S you much #

07:38.792 --> 07:41.172
# I'm rushing home #

07:41.253 --> 07:44.213
# Just as soon as I can #

07:45.716 --> 07:48.676
# I'm rushing home to see
your smiling face #

07:48.760 --> 07:50.800
# And feel your warm embrace #

07:50.888 --> 07:53.678
# It makes feel so g-g-g-good #

07:53.765 --> 07:56.475
# So I'll tell you, baby #

07:56.560 --> 08:00.310
# I'll tell your mama,
I'll tell your friends #

08:00.397 --> 08:03.687
# I'll tell anyone whose heart
can comprehend #

08:03.775 --> 08:08.485
# Send it in a letter, baby,
tell you on the phone #

08:08.572 --> 08:11.582
# I'm not the kinda girl
who likes to be alone... #

08:51.281 --> 08:53.701
- Hi.
- Hello.

09:06.630 --> 09:09.300
- You're late.
- I was hoping you wouldn't notice.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.513
It's okay, I expected it.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.393
You were late for your first day of work.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.681
- You noticed that, too.
- Yeah.

09:16.765 --> 09:19.805
I'm your advisor, I'm supposed to notice.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.319
- Do you live here alone?
- No.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.779
No, this is my family's house.

09:27.859 --> 09:31.819
My parents still live here
and, apparently, so do I.

09:34.449 --> 09:35.699
Should we?

09:35.784 --> 09:37.744
Oh, uh, yeah. Car's down this way.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.346
- All set?
- Mm-hmm.

10:19.369 --> 10:23.869
# I can tell you how I feel about you... #

10:23.957 --> 10:26.077
You're on that account, right?

10:26.168 --> 10:27.918
- Which account?
- Bottlecap?

10:28.837 --> 10:29.877
Yeah.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.301
Everything cool?

10:31.381 --> 10:33.261
Why, what did you hear?

10:33.342 --> 10:35.889
Some of the juniors said
you weren't happy with the work.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.099
They're wrong.

10:37.179 --> 10:38.429
They weren't disparaging you.

10:38.513 --> 10:41.562
They were impressed that
an associate stood up for herself

10:41.642 --> 10:43.142
the way you did.

10:43.935 --> 10:47.145
It's not the work. I mean, it is the work.

10:47.230 --> 10:50.320
It's tedious, but that's to be expected.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.860
Second year associates get the grunt work.

10:52.944 --> 10:54.614
I can live with that.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.865
I'll complain about it,
but I can live with it.

10:57.949 --> 11:01.289
It's the trademark suit
that's got me fuming.

11:01.370 --> 11:03.410
I take it you did not agree
with the judge's decision.

11:03.497 --> 11:06.167
I completely agreed
with the judge's decision.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.544
And I told Thompson six months ago

11:09.628 --> 11:12.338
that we would lose if we tried it
like a trademark dispute.

11:12.422 --> 11:16.432
I was basically silenced for
voicing a dissenting opinion.

11:16.927 --> 11:19.927
Hmm. There's no real
contribution at our level.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.767
There's only the illusion of contribution.

11:23.767 --> 11:25.887
Get ready, buster. You're on deck.

11:31.066 --> 11:34.276
Are you sure it's the firm
you're frustrated with?

11:35.529 --> 11:37.449
Shouldn't we be getting to the meeting?

11:37.531 --> 11:39.911
We have some time.
It's not for another few hours.

11:39.991 --> 11:40.991
What?

11:41.076 --> 11:42.736
I thought we'd swing by the Arts Center.

11:42.828 --> 11:44.618
There's an Afrocentric exhibit
that's supposed to be...

11:44.705 --> 11:46.915
Wait. What is this?

11:46.998 --> 11:49.128
What is this? I don't know.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.963
I mean, taken at face value, that's
a pretty existential question, Michelle.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.335
What happened to the meeting?

11:55.465 --> 11:56.715
It doesn't start till 4:00,

11:56.800 --> 11:59.550
so I thought we'd see some paintings,
maybe grab a bite to eat.

12:01.596 --> 12:04.176
We don't have to.

12:04.641 --> 12:07.689
Barack, you seem like a really sweet guy.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.979
But how many times do I have to tell you?

12:10.063 --> 12:11.693
We're not going out together.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.476
Well, Michelle, thank you for saying that.

12:14.568 --> 12:17.779
You seem like a real sweet girl,
but I have to correct you.

12:17.863 --> 12:20.533
We are in fact out,
and we are in fact together.

12:20.615 --> 12:23.945
But not on a date. This is not a date.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.575
It doesn't have to be.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.912
Barack, I don't want it to be.

12:27.998 --> 12:30.418
You know, usually women I meet
are willing to look past

12:30.500 --> 12:33.210
my hideous appearance
and get to know the real me.

12:33.295 --> 12:35.798
If I thought you were hideous,
I wouldn't have set you up with Gina.

12:35.881 --> 12:37.511
Gina's very attractive.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.721
Now that's true. Gina is very attractive.

12:40.844 --> 12:41.974
This is not a date.

12:43.555 --> 12:45.925
That's okay. I'll go at your pace.

12:46.016 --> 12:50.063
Barack, there's no pace to go at because
there's no anything to speak of.

12:50.145 --> 12:52.555
I am your advisor at our law firm.

12:52.647 --> 12:55.187
- It would be tacky.
- You keep saying that.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.485
- And you keep ignoring it.
- For good reason.

12:57.569 --> 13:01.410
You're my advisor insomuch as you introduced
me around at the beginning of the month,

13:01.490 --> 13:03.070
and you showed me
how to use the copy machine.

13:03.158 --> 13:04.788
Which, by the way,
I still can't figure out.

13:04.868 --> 13:06.948
So, some advisor.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.247
Secondly.

13:08.330 --> 13:11.210
It's not "our" law firm.
It's your law firm.

13:11.833 --> 13:12.921
I'm just here for the summer.

13:13.001 --> 13:15.591
And while you're here, it's inappropriate.

13:16.087 --> 13:19.010
So you think I'm attractive enough
to set up with your prettiest friend...

13:19.090 --> 13:20.090
You think she's that pretty?

13:20.175 --> 13:21.755
You and I share
a lot of the same interests.

13:21.843 --> 13:24.013
- I don't know that that's true.
- We both love Chicago.

13:24.095 --> 13:26.805
I get it.
You think we have a lot in common.

13:26.890 --> 13:29.430
And maybe we do, maybe we can be friends.

13:29.518 --> 13:32.478
But if you can't understand this,
then you can't understand me.

13:32.938 --> 13:36.608
It's hard enough being a woman
at a giant corporate law firm.

13:36.691 --> 13:40.151
For all the talk of equality that
goes around and all those filled quotas,

13:40.237 --> 13:42.447
I'm still surrounded by mostly men.

13:42.531 --> 13:46.241
So I gotta work just a little bit harder
to earn everyone's respect.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.246
I gotta work a little bit harder
to be taken seriously.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.329
Now add on that I'm black.

13:51.414 --> 13:54.838
All that extra work I put in
to compensate for being a woman?

13:54.918 --> 13:58.628
Being black erases that
and brings me back down to zero.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.173
So now I'm working double-time

14:00.257 --> 14:02.967
just to be seen for who I am
and what I'm capable of.

14:03.051 --> 14:05.801
Now, how's it gonna look
to a guy like Thompson

14:05.887 --> 14:08.387
if I swoop in and start dating
the first cute black guy

14:08.473 --> 14:10.479
who walks through the firm's doors?

14:10.559 --> 14:13.349
The liberal-minded people
will think it's precious,

14:13.436 --> 14:16.516
and the close-minded people
will think it's pathetic.

14:19.943 --> 14:23.113
- You think I'm cute?
- I didn't say that.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.366
Some of the secretaries
described you that way.

14:25.448 --> 14:27.198
Nice dodge. Listen, listen.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.581
We're a few blocks away.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.371
Why don't we go in
and check out the exhibit?

14:31.454 --> 14:33.668
I'd still like us to go
to the meeting a little later.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.828
It would mean a lot to me.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.915
Okay, it's not a date.

14:40.589 --> 14:43.049
- Fine.
- Until you say it is.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.946
Oh. That's Ernie Barnes.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.494
You read that in a brochure?

15:09.576 --> 15:12.616
No, I'd spot a Barnes a mile away.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.920
You know, Barnes
is a real interesting brother.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.250
Did you watch "Good Times"?

15:18.335 --> 15:20.495
- Not a family staple.
- Really?

15:21.379 --> 15:23.839
There was a black family in Chicago
that didn't watch "Good Times"?

15:24.633 --> 15:28.348
We are more of a "Brady Bunch,"
"Dick Van Dyke" kind of family.

15:28.428 --> 15:32.220
Those kids on Euclid Avenue, man,
I'm telling you, they had it good.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.306
Dy-no-mite!

15:38.730 --> 15:40.110
Do you remember that?

15:40.190 --> 15:42.360
Yes, I remember the line.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.952
- That character's name was J.J.
- Right.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.907
He was kind of a screw-up.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.831
Would steal here and there,
couldn't read or write, talked jive.

15:53.036 --> 15:55.746
You know, just a bad TV stereotype, right?

15:55.830 --> 15:57.250
Mm-hmm.

15:57.749 --> 16:02.296
But, see, as the show progressed,
J.J. developed this interest in painting.

16:03.380 --> 16:06.264
As it turned out,
he actually had a lot of talent.

16:07.258 --> 16:08.928
But he didn't take it seriously.

16:10.261 --> 16:14.348
Not until his dad,
who was this tough blue-collar guy,

16:14.432 --> 16:16.482
encouraged him to keep painting.

16:17.060 --> 16:20.690
He saw it as his son's
only way out of the projects.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.742
- What did he paint?
- Black ghetto life.

16:26.903 --> 16:30.913
They were crisp,
exaggerated, very colorful.

16:31.908 --> 16:34.698
His style was a lot like these.

16:36.705 --> 16:40.251
That's because Ernie Barnes
did all the paintings for the show.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.335
Hmm.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.100
My brother would love this.

16:59.769 --> 17:02.109
- Craig, right?
- Yeah.

17:02.981 --> 17:04.320
How did you know?

17:04.941 --> 17:08.448
I may have overheard you
talking about him at the office.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.738
Stalker.

17:10.821 --> 17:13.369
Yeah, but who's the bigger Looney Tune,

17:13.450 --> 17:16.998
the stalker or victim who willingly
goes to a museum with the stalker?

17:17.078 --> 17:18.407
Willingly?

17:19.289 --> 17:23.079
I'm more inclined to describe
this as a hostage situation.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.088
I'm that bad, huh?

17:25.170 --> 17:26.380
Oh, hush.

17:29.299 --> 17:30.509
Craig shoot hoops?

17:31.176 --> 17:32.506
He's decent.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.809
Pickup games? Office league?

17:35.889 --> 17:38.349
He's an assistant coach at Illinois Tech.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.305
No kidding.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.941
I assume he played ball at school?

17:44.022 --> 17:48.399
Yeah, at Princeton, and then
for a couple of years in the BBL.

17:48.485 --> 17:52.025
He actually got drafted by the Sixers,
but they never played him.

17:52.113 --> 17:54.493
What?

17:55.158 --> 17:58.658
I'd say "decent ballplayer"
is a gross understatement.

18:01.164 --> 18:03.003
He was decent.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.503
Great is NBA.

18:04.584 --> 18:07.173
Uh, no. Good is college.

18:07.253 --> 18:10.593
Great is your brother. Super-human is NBA.

18:12.634 --> 18:14.180
I think I came to my realization

18:14.260 --> 18:16.890
when I missed varsity
my junior year of high school.

18:17.847 --> 18:19.767
Cut class for a week after that.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.059
Why?

18:21.142 --> 18:22.692
Oh, I was hapa.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.556
So in everyone's eyes,

18:24.646 --> 18:28.396
I shouldn't have just made the team,
I should've been the best.

18:28.483 --> 18:29.779
What's "hapa"?

18:29.859 --> 18:31.779
Hawaiian for "mixed."

18:31.861 --> 18:32.861
Hmm.

18:35.907 --> 18:39.287
Maybe they didn't expect you
to be the best.

18:39.369 --> 18:42.369
Maybe you put that expectation
on yourself.

18:57.679 --> 19:00.059
Makes me think of Gwendolyn Brooks.

19:02.225 --> 19:03.885
"The pool players.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.109
Seven at the Golden Shovel.

19:10.441 --> 19:11.481
We real cool.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.702
We left school.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.157
We lurk late.

19:17.866 --> 19:20.076
We strike straight.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.200
We sing sin.

19:23.246 --> 19:25.076
We thin gin.

19:26.249 --> 19:27.999
We jazz June.

19:29.544 --> 19:31.254
- We die soon."
- "Die soon."

19:34.132 --> 19:36.012
Room Ful A'Sistahs.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.095
What do you like about this one?

19:39.929 --> 19:43.519
I guess it reminds me
of our house on Sundays.

19:44.684 --> 19:48.274
The boys would be upstairs
watching football,

19:48.354 --> 19:52.028
and the girls would be downstairs
singing around the piano.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.028
- You sing?
- I play.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.400
- Any good?
- I'm not bad.

19:57.280 --> 20:01.911
My aunt Robbie was a piano teacher,
so I started young.

20:01.993 --> 20:04.163
- How old?
- Four.

20:05.079 --> 20:08.419
- That's young.
- Not for my mom.

20:09.167 --> 20:12.207
She started us early on everything.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.763
Reading...

20:15.632 --> 20:17.132
French lessons.

20:17.217 --> 20:19.087
- You speak French?
- Mm.

20:19.177 --> 20:20.757
Are you fluent?

20:20.845 --> 20:22.505
I know a few words.

20:23.598 --> 20:26.058
I never would've taken you for a Frenchie.

20:26.142 --> 20:28.352
I mean, any other language but French.

20:28.436 --> 20:31.976
It's just so... sentimental.

20:33.483 --> 20:36.243
Il Ne faut pas Se fier aux apparences.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.280
What does that mean?

20:39.364 --> 20:43.034
It means, things are not
always as they appear.

21:50.018 --> 21:52.898
- Turkey on rye coming right up.
- Thanks.

21:53.604 --> 21:55.274
Here.

21:55.356 --> 21:57.356
It's on me.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.738
Okay, okay.

22:04.574 --> 22:08.287
And now, the grand finale.

22:11.122 --> 22:12.669
What, no good?

22:12.749 --> 22:16.749
That was sweet of you,
but I don't like pie.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.546
No, you're mistaken.

22:18.629 --> 22:22.299
This is not a slice of pie,
this is a slice of heaven.

22:23.509 --> 22:24.509
Mm.

22:25.970 --> 22:27.350
Who doesn't like pie?

22:27.430 --> 22:29.470
I'm an ice cream kind of girl.

22:29.557 --> 22:31.847
Oh, yeah?

22:31.934 --> 22:35.064
- Which flavor?
- Chocolate.

22:36.689 --> 22:37.689
Ugh!

22:38.733 --> 22:41.113
What, you don't like chocolate ice cream?

22:41.194 --> 22:42.949
I don't like ice cream, period.

22:43.029 --> 22:45.909
Now that's weirder than not liking pie.

22:45.990 --> 22:49.330
Not when you spent a summer in high school
working at Baskin-Robbins, it's not.

22:49.410 --> 22:50.870
I overdid it.

22:52.205 --> 22:54.665
They had Baskin-Robbins in Hawaii?

22:54.749 --> 22:57.669
You do know Hawaii is part of
these here United States, don't you?

22:58.628 --> 23:01.088
It just seems so foreign.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.430
Honolulu's pretty normal.

23:05.510 --> 23:08.100
Played hoops all day.
Went to a good school.

23:09.847 --> 23:12.267
Then again, there's a lot
about my high school years

23:12.350 --> 23:13.890
I do not remember.

23:15.019 --> 23:16.059
Why?

23:16.687 --> 23:20.527
Let's just say a lot of it
got lost in a cloudy haze.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.244
Oh.

23:23.444 --> 23:25.992
Because you smoked a lot of marijuana?

23:26.072 --> 23:29.492
Yes, because I smoked a lot of marijuana.

23:33.830 --> 23:35.500
I had a lot of growing up to do.

23:59.063 --> 24:01.819
One time, when I was nine years old,

24:01.899 --> 24:06.449
I go to this girl's birthday party,
and I show up, and it's me and 20 girls.

24:06.529 --> 24:08.319
I'm the only boy there.

24:08.406 --> 24:11.739
When I asked them why,
they all just started laughing at me.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.369
I remember running all the way home.
I was mortified.

24:16.372 --> 24:17.792
What made you think of that?

24:17.874 --> 24:20.004
I don't know, just popped in my head.

24:20.084 --> 24:21.504
I could never figure it out.

24:22.920 --> 24:26.590
Hey, you're a smart lady.
Why were they laughing at me?

24:27.133 --> 24:29.138
They probably had crushes on you.

24:29.218 --> 24:30.258
Hmm.

24:30.344 --> 24:33.851
I mean, everything's backwards
when you're little.

24:33.931 --> 24:36.181
When a boy likes you, he pulls your hair.

24:36.267 --> 24:39.147
When you like a boy,
you kick him in the shins.

24:39.228 --> 24:40.858
You do any shin-kicking back in the day?

24:40.938 --> 24:46.190
If you were on the playground,
and you were brown and cute, watch out.

24:46.277 --> 24:48.357
You, uh...

24:48.446 --> 24:50.406
doing any shin-kicking these days?

24:51.240 --> 24:53.329
Are you inquiring about my personal life?

24:53.409 --> 24:54.829
I might be.

24:55.870 --> 24:58.080
Well, the answer is no.

24:59.957 --> 25:01.787
Tell me more about your...

25:02.793 --> 25:04.753
grade-school Casanova years.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.665
No, no, I couldn't have been less popular.

25:08.758 --> 25:13.345
The kids in Indonesia used to throw me
in the swamp and call me "Blackberry."

25:13.429 --> 25:14.559
Indonesia?

25:14.639 --> 25:16.849
Yeah, I lived in Jakarta for a few years.

25:17.600 --> 25:20.690
I'm not kidding.
We had crocodiles in the backyard.

25:21.604 --> 25:23.524
But...

25:23.606 --> 25:27.146
but why were you living there?
I mean, how did you end up there?

25:27.234 --> 25:31.658
Lolo, my mother's ex-husband,
was from there and went back for work.

25:31.739 --> 25:34.579
- We went with him.
- But where was your dad?

25:36.911 --> 25:38.371
He was back in Kenya.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.120
And you didn't wanna live with him?

25:44.794 --> 25:46.344
It wasn't an option.

25:56.806 --> 25:59.306
Anyway, I didn't have
to suffer at the hands

25:59.392 --> 26:02.189
of my Indonesian tormentors for long.

26:02.269 --> 26:04.649
I moved back to Hawaii when I was 10.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.980
My mother wanted me
to get a better education.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.897
Well, did you?

26:10.987 --> 26:12.357
I don't know.

26:12.446 --> 26:15.236
How would you rate my level of education?

26:17.326 --> 26:20.656
You're like that jive-talking
stereotype from "Good Times."

26:22.707 --> 26:24.037
So, what about you?

26:25.626 --> 26:27.086
What about me?

26:27.169 --> 26:29.259
You're Ivy League through and through.

26:30.131 --> 26:32.011
Craig got the natural smarts.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.221
I just worked my butt off.

26:34.301 --> 26:35.890
I'm sure your mother made sure of that.

26:35.970 --> 26:37.680
She never had to.

26:37.763 --> 26:41.433
Education was always priority number one.

26:41.517 --> 26:43.887
My dad would stand for nothing less.

26:43.978 --> 26:46.806
And there was no way Craig
and I were gonna disappoint him.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.033
What's he like?

26:51.068 --> 26:53.488
He's the greatest man in the world.

26:55.406 --> 27:00.162
He told us from day one,
education was the key to our happiness,

27:00.244 --> 27:02.164
and he didn't let us forget it.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.210
What's he do for a living?

27:05.291 --> 27:08.291
Operations engineer
for the Water Department.

27:08.377 --> 27:10.587
Basically, he fixes the boilers.

27:10.671 --> 27:12.718
He's been there since '68.

27:12.798 --> 27:15.378
That must be
where you get your work ethic.

27:16.552 --> 27:18.849
You don't know the half of it.

27:18.929 --> 27:20.639
Well, tell me, then.

27:22.349 --> 27:24.139
You're asking a lot of questions.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.274
You don't have to answer them, Michelle.

27:32.276 --> 27:35.026
Can you keep what's said
outside the office...

27:36.363 --> 27:38.413
outside the office?

27:39.950 --> 27:43.330
Michelle, I've been trying to get you
outside the office for a month now.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.170
I'm serious.

27:48.084 --> 27:50.384
Yes, absolutely.

27:54.965 --> 27:56.795
My dad has MS.

27:59.637 --> 28:01.557
That why you live at home?

28:01.639 --> 28:04.429
It's better to be there and to help out.

28:05.434 --> 28:06.984
He's on crutches now.

28:08.646 --> 28:12.106
Still gets himself to work every day.

28:16.946 --> 28:19.736
You know, they're lucky
to have a daughter like you.

28:21.283 --> 28:23.663
I'm lucky to have parents like them.

28:31.794 --> 28:33.254
Is your mother still alive?

28:34.004 --> 28:36.802
Oh, yeah. Still in Jakarta.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.512
She's a wonderful lady.

28:38.592 --> 28:40.181
But you don't see her much.

28:40.261 --> 28:42.301
No, she has her own life.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.558
But she's brilliant, warm...

28:45.307 --> 28:46.677
Truly wonderful.

28:47.643 --> 28:49.940
- And she's white.
- Snow white.

28:50.020 --> 28:51.940
Born in Wichita, Kansas.

28:52.022 --> 28:53.902
- You were born in '60?
- '61.

28:54.984 --> 28:56.034
Hmm.

28:57.862 --> 29:00.322
A white woman and a black man

29:00.406 --> 29:03.616
getting married
and having a kid back then.

29:03.701 --> 29:05.491
They were ahead of their time.

29:06.287 --> 29:08.867
You want the God's honest truth
about my folks?

29:08.956 --> 29:10.666
- Sure.
- Okay.

29:10.749 --> 29:14.419
My mother thought Harry Belafonte
was the most handsome man

29:14.503 --> 29:16.258
on the face of the planet.

29:16.338 --> 29:18.798
Yeah, I'd say chocolate
was her favorite flavor, too.

29:20.843 --> 29:21.931
No, really.

29:22.011 --> 29:23.721
I think their attraction was that simple.

29:24.972 --> 29:29.938
My father looked like Nat King Cole,
and my mother looked like Patsy Cline.

30:27.910 --> 30:28.950
Whoo!

30:57.940 --> 30:59.610
Not bad at all, Miss Robinson.

30:59.692 --> 31:01.612
Those drummers were incredible.

31:01.694 --> 31:02.904
- Yeah, they were.
- Mm.

31:02.987 --> 31:04.027
I wonder if they were African.

31:04.113 --> 31:05.910
- Why?
- Well, it could be a ritual.

31:05.990 --> 31:08.910
I was part of one while visiting
my family's village in Kenya.

31:08.993 --> 31:10.703
What were the rituals for?

31:11.495 --> 31:12.955
Prayer, mostly.

31:14.123 --> 31:16.462
Hey, do you believe in God?

31:16.542 --> 31:19.042
You like to go straight
for the jugular, don't you?

31:19.128 --> 31:20.378
You have a real nice jugular.

31:20.462 --> 31:22.802
- Real defined, real sexy.
- Watch it now.

31:23.716 --> 31:27.046
Growing up, we went to church
on Sundays, but...

31:27.761 --> 31:28.849
I don't know.

31:28.929 --> 31:32.429
I believe in some sort of guiding spirit.

31:32.516 --> 31:36.436
But I also think God helps
those who help themselves.

31:36.520 --> 31:39.020
I think I saw that
on a bumper sticker somewhere.

31:39.106 --> 31:41.356
- That's how you know it's good.
- Ah.

31:41.942 --> 31:44.072
And your religious proclivities?

31:44.153 --> 31:46.863
Let's just say I'm still evolving.

31:46.947 --> 31:49.197
- What were you raised?
- Nothing, really.

31:49.283 --> 31:51.703
My mom didn't associate
with any one religion.

31:51.785 --> 31:54.575
And your father, was he like you?

31:55.164 --> 31:59.251
About the only thing my father and I had
in common is that we both went to Harvard.

31:59.335 --> 32:01.335
The only difference is, he got kicked out.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.010
You still got two years.

32:03.756 --> 32:06.126
Think that's enough time for me
to develop a drinking problem

32:06.216 --> 32:08.546
and burn through all my student loans?

32:09.762 --> 32:11.722
You don't like talking about him.

32:11.805 --> 32:13.515
There isn't much to say, unfortunately.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.059
That can't be true.

32:16.185 --> 32:17.385
It is true.

32:17.478 --> 32:19.058
His life was incomplete.

32:19.563 --> 32:21.153
In every imaginable way.

32:21.774 --> 32:24.904
He married my mother,
they had me, he left.

32:25.569 --> 32:28.489
Went to Harvard, got kicked out,
never got his Ph.D.

32:29.198 --> 32:32.658
Got a job at the Kenyan
government, got fired.

32:33.202 --> 32:35.202
Never found a stable job again.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.707
Had a few too many drinks
at a bar one night,

32:37.790 --> 32:40.580
got behind the wheel, never made it home.

32:41.794 --> 32:44.514
He died when he was 46.
His life was incomplete.

32:45.881 --> 32:47.761
Even his tombstone is blank.

32:47.841 --> 32:49.680
No one bothered to have it engraved.

32:49.760 --> 32:52.599
No one bothered?
All that family over there?

32:52.679 --> 32:54.599
No one had the money.

32:59.061 --> 33:00.561
You'll do it.

33:01.397 --> 33:05.153
When you have the money, you'll go
back there and have his name engraved.

33:07.444 --> 33:09.658
You think you know me well enough
to make that prediction?

33:09.738 --> 33:11.198
No.

33:11.281 --> 33:13.579
But I am a pretty hopeful person,

33:13.659 --> 33:17.409
so I'll just say, I hope you do it.

33:24.837 --> 33:26.507
We should probably get to the meeting.

33:30.259 --> 33:32.509
- # The world is yours #
- # Hey, young world #

33:32.594 --> 33:35.724
- # The world is yours #
- # Young world, young world #

33:35.806 --> 33:39.266
- # The world is yours #
- # Young world #

33:40.519 --> 33:43.108
# It may cause concern #

33:44.940 --> 33:46.900
...Denby of "New York" magazine

33:46.984 --> 33:50.199
thinks Spike Lee's new picture
is gonna cause them black folk to riot,

33:50.279 --> 33:53.449
but Chicago's native son Roger Ebert
calls it a masterpiece.

33:53.532 --> 33:54.742
Have you seen it? Who's seen it?

33:54.825 --> 33:56.695
What's the good word? You rioting yet?

33:56.785 --> 33:59.365
Hit the phones and let me know,
and if you haven't checked it out yet,

33:59.455 --> 34:01.495
do the right thing and see it now!

34:02.374 --> 34:03.754
Dying to see this movie.

34:03.834 --> 34:06.382
Sounds interesting enough.

34:06.462 --> 34:08.882
Blick, Thompson, and Cohen
were talking about it in the office.

34:08.964 --> 34:12.012
And Thompson said the film
might be racist towards white people.

34:12.092 --> 34:13.472
No, he didn't.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.302
He didn't mean anything by it.

34:15.888 --> 34:18.178
He's just a little
out of touch, that's all.

34:19.141 --> 34:21.938
I'm just tired of being
two different people.

34:22.018 --> 34:24.730
I played that game at Princeton,
and I played it again at Harvard.

34:25.481 --> 34:28.225
There were white kids at school
who would talk to me in class,

34:28.317 --> 34:31.987
but if I saw them out on the quad,
and they were with their other friends,

34:32.070 --> 34:34.909
they would walk right past me
without so much as a nod.

34:34.989 --> 34:38.370
Now, obviously, the firm is not like that

34:38.452 --> 34:41.542
but sometimes when I'm leaving
Southside in the morning,

34:41.621 --> 34:44.920
headed for the Loop,
I feel like I'm leaving Planet Black

34:45.000 --> 34:46.880
and landing on Planet White.

34:48.462 --> 34:51.922
Come on, you got wooed, just like me.

34:52.007 --> 34:53.547
You got wined and dined.

34:53.634 --> 34:56.389
You saw the corporate culture,
the racial culture.

34:56.469 --> 34:58.560
You knew the score,
and you still said yes.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.595
You sure it's the firm
you're frustrated with?

35:01.683 --> 35:03.939
That's the second time
you've asked me that question.

35:04.019 --> 35:06.149
It's the second time
you haven't answered it.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.653
What are you suggesting?

35:09.733 --> 35:11.863
Take the Bottlecap case as an example.

35:11.944 --> 35:15.993
Once you made your point,
why bother pressing further?

35:16.073 --> 35:19.283
- To try and get through to Thompson.
- Come on, you knew you wouldn't.

35:19.368 --> 35:21.448
Like you said,
you're a second year associate.

35:21.537 --> 35:23.287
Thompson wants you doing research,

35:23.372 --> 35:25.461
interfacing with the clients,
preparing his arguments.

35:25.541 --> 35:27.581
- The grunt work, right?
- Right.

35:27.668 --> 35:29.878
But if I don't speak up,
what's the alternative?

35:29.962 --> 35:32.301
Shut my mouth
and sit there looking pretty?

35:32.381 --> 35:34.261
First of all, you always
sit there looking pretty.

35:34.341 --> 35:37.551
Second of all, I'm not suggesting
you silence yourself.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.506
I'm just wondering why you chose
to work at a corporate firm

35:40.597 --> 35:42.677
where you knew your silence
would be expected.

35:43.433 --> 35:45.481
And really what I'm wondering is why

35:45.561 --> 35:47.561
you're wasting the fight
you have inside you

35:47.646 --> 35:50.606
on battles you can't win
and issues you don't care about?

35:52.025 --> 35:53.605
Excuse me?

35:54.987 --> 35:57.947
You think because we spend
one afternoon together

35:58.031 --> 36:00.201
and you tried to buy me a sandwich,

36:00.284 --> 36:03.504
you're entitled to pass judgment
on the choices I made in my life?

36:04.580 --> 36:07.370
- You think I'm wasting my life.
- Now, I never used those words.

36:07.457 --> 36:09.627
You didn't have to use those words.

36:09.710 --> 36:13.090
You used other ones,
and they stung just as much.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.381
Why?

36:14.464 --> 36:17.804
If you really loved what you were doing,
would you be bothered by what I said?

36:18.594 --> 36:19.848
No.

36:19.928 --> 36:22.678
You'd tell me to go screw myself,
and you'd go on your merry way,

36:22.764 --> 36:25.521
making tons of cash and doing trademark
law for the rest of your life.

36:25.601 --> 36:28.061
And how do you know that's
not exactly what I plan to do?

36:28.145 --> 36:31.355
Because you spent two years
of law school in Gannett House,

36:31.440 --> 36:33.860
working pro Bono cases
for poor, single moms.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.652
And my guess is that it kills you

36:35.736 --> 36:38.446
to know you can't put
the same passion and intelligence

36:38.530 --> 36:40.450
towards cases that
actually mean something.

36:41.783 --> 36:45.913
You're more than welcome to
pass judgment on your own father.

36:45.996 --> 36:49.036
You know what, you're more than
welcome to pass judgment on me.

36:50.417 --> 36:54.835
But quite frankly, it sounds like you
know me about as little as you knew him.

36:54.921 --> 36:56.631
- Michelle...
- And the biggest offense is,

36:56.715 --> 36:59.255
this is coming from a guy
who quit community organizing

36:59.343 --> 37:03.600
for Harvard Law, only to take a summer
position at the same corporate firm

37:03.680 --> 37:05.390
he's railing against.

37:07.059 --> 37:10.149
Now that is the height of hypocrisy.

37:13.190 --> 37:15.320
I apologize. I meant no offense.

39:28.783 --> 39:30.163
Barack!

39:31.828 --> 39:32.908
Ladies!

39:33.788 --> 39:34.788
Hey!

39:35.916 --> 39:37.166
Oh...

39:37.709 --> 39:39.539
So happy to see you guys.

39:39.628 --> 39:40.878
Looks like we got a full house today.

39:40.962 --> 39:42.759
Well, everyone heard
you was coming, Barack.

39:42.839 --> 39:45.719
We all wanted to get a look at
our Harvard man all grown up.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.050
Does a year and a half change a man?

39:47.135 --> 39:50.305
No, but apparently it gets you a lady.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.268
And finally a sista.

39:52.349 --> 39:53.889
How you doing, sweetie?

39:53.975 --> 39:56.385
- My name's Bernadette.
- Oh! I'm Michelle.

39:56.478 --> 39:57.848
Very nice to meet you.

39:57.938 --> 39:59.768
- I'm Janice.
- Hi.

39:59.856 --> 40:02.476
We was your boyfriend's ladies
while he was working here in the Gardens.

40:02.567 --> 40:05.317
- Oh, we're not...
- Platonic ladies, Janice.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.033
Don't go giving her any ideas.

40:08.114 --> 40:09.870
We did everything together.

40:09.950 --> 40:11.538
Except the sexy stuff.

40:11.618 --> 40:15.208
Hmm. Now this is a real man
you got yourself here.

40:15.830 --> 40:17.580
Just going right over there.

40:21.836 --> 40:23.416
Tommy, my man!

40:23.505 --> 40:25.295
B!

40:26.049 --> 40:27.429
Oh, it's so good to see you.

40:27.509 --> 40:29.009
Yo, Rafiqa!

40:29.094 --> 40:31.892
This Barack's woman, Michelle.

40:31.972 --> 40:33.560
- He done well for himself.
- Mm-hmm.

40:33.640 --> 40:34.850
Welcome.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.730
Janice, we're not together.

40:36.810 --> 40:38.350
You say this Barack's girl?

40:38.436 --> 40:41.356
No, Kyle, this Barack's woman, Michelle.

40:41.439 --> 40:42.729
Y'all married and shit?

40:42.816 --> 40:45.856
Kyle, watch your mouth.
Your ass in church.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.067
Y'all married?

40:51.157 --> 40:53.827
No. We're not together.

40:53.910 --> 40:55.040
At all.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.826
Let me tell you a little
something about Barack.

41:02.210 --> 41:04.500
My son LaJuan wanted to be in the Navy

41:04.588 --> 41:07.418
since he was playing
with toy boats in the tub.

41:08.008 --> 41:10.888
But growing up in the Gardens, ooh!

41:10.969 --> 41:13.259
Little by little,
the place was getting to him,

41:13.346 --> 41:15.466
and he was starting to get the same ideas

41:15.557 --> 41:17.977
as every other young Negro around here.

41:18.059 --> 41:21.099
Thinking there ain't no place
for 'em outside these walls.

41:21.187 --> 41:23.727
And even if there was, ain't no way out.

41:24.691 --> 41:26.231
Well, in comes Barack.

41:26.943 --> 41:30.492
And every time he come by
the house to talk business,

41:30.572 --> 41:36.122
he sets aside a little time to talk
with my LaJuan about Navy boats.

41:36.202 --> 41:38.792
I don't even know
how Barack knew about Navy boats.

41:38.872 --> 41:41.292
And he could've been
making up names, for all I know.

41:41.374 --> 41:44.964
The USS this and the USS that.

41:45.503 --> 41:47.259
Didn't matter.

41:47.339 --> 41:49.379
He kept LaJuan interested.

41:50.675 --> 41:54.716
He told my boy that he could be anything

41:54.804 --> 41:56.354
if he worked hard enough.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.845
You see, he didn't have
a father to tell him that.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.188
And you know what?

42:07.651 --> 42:10.111
- He made it out.
- Mm, mm.

42:10.195 --> 42:13.985
My son is sailing across the seas

42:14.074 --> 42:16.788
on the "USS Dakota."

42:16.868 --> 42:21.830
Looking all fly and professional
in his military uniform.

42:21.915 --> 42:25.165
Hands off, girl.
That's my boy you talking about.

42:32.008 --> 42:34.088
Afternoon, everybody. Afternoon.

42:34.177 --> 42:36.097
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon.

42:36.179 --> 42:37.639
Right, right, right. Okay now.

42:37.722 --> 42:39.972
Today, you know we here to
discuss the Community Center.

42:40.058 --> 42:42.268
What Community Center?

42:42.352 --> 42:43.440
Look, I know.

42:43.520 --> 42:45.609
I know the city's decision was
a disappointment, all right?

42:45.689 --> 42:48.479
No, Tommy, it was more
than a disappointment.

42:48.566 --> 42:51.736
It was six months of our lives
down the drain.

42:54.948 --> 42:57.118
Okay, hold on. Everybody, just hold on.

42:57.200 --> 42:59.910
It was a disappointment.
But it wasn't all bad.

42:59.994 --> 43:02.208
See, now we got ourselves
not one, not two,

43:02.288 --> 43:04.668
but three foundations to fund
our Community Center programs

43:04.749 --> 43:07.499
when the time is right,
and I got that in writing.

43:08.878 --> 43:11.758
Now, how in God's name
are they supposed to fund

43:11.840 --> 43:15.220
our Community Center programs
when we ain't got no Community Center?

43:15.301 --> 43:17.511
That's right. That's right.

43:17.595 --> 43:20.515
Well, that's the dilemma
we here today to solve.

43:20.598 --> 43:24.098
Now, what we have to do first is take
a look at why the City Council said no.

43:24.185 --> 43:26.805
Well, what difference does it make?
They say no to everything we ask for.

43:26.896 --> 43:28.896
Now, that's just not always true, Curtis.

43:28.982 --> 43:31.232
Now, we got that
job center up and running.

43:31.317 --> 43:33.987
We got people's apartments
on hold for them while they rehabbing.

43:34.070 --> 43:35.780
Look, all I know is this,

43:35.864 --> 43:38.662
Senator Torrance got himself a state grant

43:38.742 --> 43:41.492
to build a church
that he's gonna preach in,

43:41.578 --> 43:43.788
and Alderman Said helped him get it.

43:45.957 --> 43:49.537
Meanwhile, my little girls
can't go but a mile up the road

43:49.627 --> 43:52.257
to play for all the gangs
running around the Gardens,

43:52.338 --> 43:55.258
pushing they drugs,
littering they garbage,

43:55.341 --> 43:58.761
shooting they guns like this
is the Wild West or something.

43:58.845 --> 44:02.095
Shoot, our kids can't even
go play in they friends' house

44:02.182 --> 44:04.562
across the street at the Gates.

44:05.351 --> 44:09.857
The Senator got himself a church,
our kids got themselves the shaft.

44:15.653 --> 44:17.200
Okay, okay, okay!

44:17.280 --> 44:21.786
There's a lot of issues to address,
and I know better than anyone else.

44:22.619 --> 44:24.749
Come on, I've devoted my life
to helping this community,

44:24.829 --> 44:26.918
- but we got to stay focused.
- That's right.

44:26.998 --> 44:29.998
Look, we got to take our anger
and channel it towards the goals we set,

44:30.084 --> 44:32.714
and right now that's the Community Center.

44:32.796 --> 44:34.296
Now, you know from past experiences,

44:34.380 --> 44:37.010
we got things done because
we honed in on one issue,

44:37.091 --> 44:40.799
we pressed, we squeezed, and we
screamed until somebody finally listened.

44:40.887 --> 44:43.137
It's taking too long.
We tired of screaming.

44:43.223 --> 44:45.483
- Well, then ain't nothing gonna change.
- Well, maybe it can't.

44:47.435 --> 44:48.685
Huh?

44:53.191 --> 44:54.531
Look, I disagree.

44:56.694 --> 45:00.318
And I'm sure our guest here
disagrees, too, because I seem to recall

45:00.406 --> 45:04.491
when he was standing here in my position,
by this podium, a year and a half ago,

45:04.577 --> 45:05.697
y'all got something done.

45:06.412 --> 45:08.462
I seem to recall, with his guidance...

45:09.457 --> 45:13.037
your patience and persistence, y'all
got that asbestos problem cleared up.

45:14.295 --> 45:17.835
Got them toilets fixed. The pipes cleaned.

45:19.050 --> 45:22.010
Now, I know when times were tough,
this brother right here...

45:23.429 --> 45:25.139
had a lot of motivational words for us.

45:25.223 --> 45:28.062
And I'm gonna ask him to come up
and say a few right now.

45:28.142 --> 45:30.852
'Cause I'm gonna tell you something,
we might be down for the count...

45:32.897 --> 45:34.357
but we ain't out.

45:37.235 --> 45:39.945
Brother Barack, would you come on up?

45:43.199 --> 45:45.739
- It's all you.
- Thanks, bro. Thank you.

45:48.162 --> 45:49.332
Thank you.

45:51.541 --> 45:52.831
It's good to be back.

45:54.669 --> 45:56.459
It's good to see all of you.

45:57.422 --> 45:59.922
I missed that musty smell up here.

46:01.885 --> 46:05.386
Looks like Pastor Mike hasn't gotten
around to filling in that hole in the roof.

46:05.471 --> 46:06.601
No.

46:06.681 --> 46:09.271
Think we're gonna have to organize
a meeting just to get that leak fixed.

46:13.146 --> 46:14.396
But listen.

46:17.233 --> 46:19.993
I, uh... I feel your pain.

46:21.738 --> 46:22.778
I do.

46:22.864 --> 46:24.244
It's...

46:24.324 --> 46:25.624
It's a part of me now, that pain.

46:27.410 --> 46:29.830
Sometimes it hits me like a heart attack,

46:29.913 --> 46:32.923
hundreds of miles away
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

46:34.709 --> 46:38.459
Now, I could be listening to
a lecture in class,

46:38.546 --> 46:40.586
or studying in the library...

46:41.883 --> 46:44.053
or watching a movie,
or talking to a friend...

46:45.094 --> 46:46.764
and I think of all of you.

46:48.514 --> 46:51.394
I may have gone on to
a different life at Harvard...

46:51.893 --> 46:53.813
but you know what I've realized?

46:56.773 --> 46:59.443
I never left the Gardens.

47:00.652 --> 47:02.532
Now...

47:02.612 --> 47:04.492
Tommy deserves some credit here, folks.

47:05.323 --> 47:07.533
Our fight with the City Council
two years ago

47:07.617 --> 47:11.866
was proof that these victories do not
come easy, and they don't come big.

47:12.580 --> 47:14.250
They are few and far between.

47:15.917 --> 47:18.247
But you gotta use them
like building blocks.

47:18.920 --> 47:22.838
One by one, one on top
of the other, and little by little...

47:23.591 --> 47:25.091
you got yourself a building.

47:25.969 --> 47:27.679
And that's exactly
what you need in this case,

47:27.762 --> 47:30.522
is a building for your Community Center.

47:31.140 --> 47:33.350
Now, I feel your disappointment.

47:35.520 --> 47:37.190
But the truth is...

47:38.564 --> 47:40.361
you're in a good position right now.

47:41.484 --> 47:42.989
Still ain't got no Community Center!

47:43.069 --> 47:44.359
All right, all right. All right.

47:45.279 --> 47:47.909
Tommy got funding pledges. That's real.

47:47.991 --> 47:50.201
That's money down the line,
and that's hard to secure.

47:51.452 --> 47:54.584
Now, I know it's not the whole package,
but think about it.

47:55.331 --> 47:56.921
Now all you need is a building.

47:57.792 --> 47:59.252
You're halfway there.

47:59.961 --> 48:02.211
Now, the Council said no to the building,

48:02.296 --> 48:04.256
but that was before
you had funding pledges

48:04.340 --> 48:07.300
secured with the help
of Brother Tommy here.

48:08.511 --> 48:10.891
So now, when you remount your campaign...

48:11.681 --> 48:13.728
you have something to bring to the table.

48:13.808 --> 48:15.058
You're contributing.

48:15.143 --> 48:18.103
And the folks downtown
like to see us contributing.

48:18.187 --> 48:21.267
Makes 'em feel like the money they
give you is gonna be put to good use.

48:22.150 --> 48:23.940
Just wanna know that you care.

48:25.153 --> 48:29.573
And Tommy's right when he says we need
to take a look at why they said no.

48:29.657 --> 48:31.237
Not because it's the right decision,

48:31.325 --> 48:33.995
but because you've gotta understand
where they're coming from.

48:34.537 --> 48:37.827
You've gotta understand the city's
motivations, its self-interest

48:37.915 --> 48:40.585
in order to align them with your own.

48:41.919 --> 48:44.799
We turn self-interest
into mutual interest.

48:45.965 --> 48:49.545
So, let's give the council members

48:49.635 --> 48:51.425
the benefit of the doubt for a moment.

48:52.680 --> 48:55.430
Let's say they want you
to have your Community Center.

48:59.854 --> 49:02.274
Okay, okay. But let's say for a moment

49:02.356 --> 49:04.646
that we got some
good folks on that Council,

49:04.734 --> 49:07.532
and they'd like to see your kids
have a place to go after school and play.

49:07.612 --> 49:08.652
Yeah, right.

49:08.738 --> 49:11.238
Now, I believe there probably are a few.

49:11.991 --> 49:13.991
So, if we've got some
good-hearted folks there...

49:15.495 --> 49:18.245
why can't they get your
funding request approved?

49:19.040 --> 49:21.250
Getting paid to say no.

49:21.334 --> 49:23.840
Okay, Curtis, I hear you, I hear you.

49:23.920 --> 49:26.210
- Anyone else?
- Don't care enough.

49:26.297 --> 49:29.337
All right. Any other ideas?

49:30.176 --> 49:31.796
Maybe they don't think they can.

49:36.474 --> 49:37.934
That's what I'm thinking, Kyle.

49:39.852 --> 49:42.232
I don't think they believe
they can get it done.

49:42.313 --> 49:43.563
Even if they wanted to.

49:44.524 --> 49:46.654
They know developers don't
wanna build in the Gardens.

49:47.693 --> 49:51.451
There's nothing in it for them.
No stores. No economy.

49:51.531 --> 49:54.451
These council members don't necessarily
want the answer to be no,

49:54.534 --> 49:56.414
they just believe it will be.

49:56.494 --> 49:59.083
So, what are you proposing, Barack,
that we build the damn thing ourselves?

49:59.163 --> 50:01.463
Almost. Almost, Curtis.

50:02.041 --> 50:05.001
Now, Tommy and I have
been discussing this.

50:05.086 --> 50:09.625
And we both think you might wanna
consider changing the goal slightly.

50:10.174 --> 50:13.304
Refocus your efforts on
obtaining a land designation.

50:14.929 --> 50:16.349
Now, if you control the land...

50:17.473 --> 50:21.063
you can cut a deal with one developer
to build everything in the area...

50:22.061 --> 50:26.652
on the condition that one of the buildings
be the Community Center.

50:27.775 --> 50:31.445
Now, that's more jobs, more stores,

50:31.529 --> 50:34.239
and a Community Center for your children.

50:34.323 --> 50:37.121
They just gonna say no
like they say no to everything else!

50:37.201 --> 50:40.121
Now, we gotta stop thinking the word
"no" is the end of the line, Curtis.

50:40.955 --> 50:42.955
"No" is just a word.

50:43.040 --> 50:45.920
You flip those letters around,
you get an entirely different word.

50:47.128 --> 50:49.918
- "On."
- That's right.

50:50.006 --> 50:52.426
As in "carry on."

50:53.593 --> 50:55.303
Say it with me now.

50:55.386 --> 50:57.466
- Carry on!
- Carry on!

50:57.555 --> 50:59.925
- They say no, we say...
- Carry on.

51:00.016 --> 51:02.976
- They say no, we say...
- Carry on!

51:06.814 --> 51:09.364
That's it! There you go!

51:21.954 --> 51:24.334
- Harold Washington...
- My man.

51:25.416 --> 51:28.836
Harold Washington was one of
the reasons I moved to Chicago.

51:30.421 --> 51:33.171
When I first came here, every barbershop

51:33.257 --> 51:36.257
and chicken shack on the Southside
had a squeaky-clean picture of him

51:36.344 --> 51:37.974
hanging up on the wall
for everyone to see.

51:38.054 --> 51:40.514
- You right about that.
- Still do.

51:40.598 --> 51:42.348
Chicago's first black mayor.

51:43.517 --> 51:45.897
- He was our mayor.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

51:46.604 --> 51:50.734
But even Mayor Washington
disappointed in some respects.

51:52.401 --> 51:54.951
He had to face the great
truth of our country...

51:56.197 --> 51:58.157
that it's not easy to get things done.

52:00.284 --> 52:02.454
The founders made it that way on purpose.

52:03.537 --> 52:04.907
They made it messy...

52:06.165 --> 52:11.166
so that no one law,
no one government, no one man

52:11.253 --> 52:13.763
could decide the fate of
everything and everyone.

52:19.220 --> 52:20.930
In very simple terms...

52:22.306 --> 52:25.426
we got a heck of a lot of different people

52:25.518 --> 52:27.808
with a heck of a lot of different agendas.

52:28.896 --> 52:32.146
But I also believe
that people, most people...

52:33.150 --> 52:36.400
are basically, at their core, good people.

52:38.364 --> 52:42.244
And so, if at first we don't
understand their agenda...

52:42.952 --> 52:46.042
the City Council, the Alderman,
the State Senator...

52:48.249 --> 52:52.548
we have to try our hardest
to understand who they are

52:52.628 --> 52:54.338
and what they need.

52:59.301 --> 53:00.891
We have to let go of judgment.

53:05.266 --> 53:06.846
That's a lesson...

53:09.395 --> 53:12.305
I learned today from a friend.

53:16.277 --> 53:18.277
No matter what we think about someone...

53:20.072 --> 53:22.282
we never truly know what it's like

53:22.366 --> 53:23.946
to walk in their shoes.

53:26.704 --> 53:28.214
But we have to try.

53:30.916 --> 53:34.036
Whether it's a colleague,
a family member...

53:34.837 --> 53:38.007
or a particular opponent,
especially our opponents.

53:39.967 --> 53:43.047
Because where their needs
align with our needs...

53:44.805 --> 53:46.595
is where things get done.

53:49.477 --> 53:50.897
That's America.

53:53.314 --> 53:55.074
Just a bunch of different states.

53:55.983 --> 53:57.943
States of land, states of mind...

53:58.819 --> 54:00.569
states of people.

54:02.364 --> 54:04.454
And it's up to us, all of us...

54:05.659 --> 54:09.659
to keep all those different states...

54:11.499 --> 54:12.789
united.

54:35.272 --> 54:37.319
Thanks for inviting me.

54:37.399 --> 54:40.952
It's been a while since I've had that
kind of connection to real-life struggle.

54:41.821 --> 54:42.821
Me, too.

54:46.325 --> 54:49.865
In high school, my typing
teacher gave me an A minus.

54:52.498 --> 54:56.538
I wrote her a letter every day
until she changed it to an A.

54:58.379 --> 55:00.169
I celebrated all day long.

55:01.799 --> 55:04.589
But that night, I couldn't sleep.

55:05.761 --> 55:09.601
I kept asking myself over and over again,

55:09.682 --> 55:11.812
"Did I even deserve the A?"

55:14.186 --> 55:16.646
Sometimes I forget why I'm fighting.

55:18.190 --> 55:20.230
Or even that I am fighting.

55:22.069 --> 55:25.989
I didn't know I was wrestling
with myself about the firm.

55:30.202 --> 55:31.502
I understand that.

55:35.541 --> 55:37.291
You think you're real smooth, don't you?

55:37.376 --> 55:38.836
Why?

55:38.919 --> 55:41.008
Did you know you were speaking today?

55:41.088 --> 55:42.088
No.

55:43.757 --> 55:45.717
Well, not exactly.

55:47.970 --> 55:50.180
I knew there was a decent chance, yeah.

55:51.056 --> 55:52.516
Mm-hmm.

55:52.600 --> 55:55.190
Pretty good setting to bring a girl.

55:56.186 --> 55:58.726
Surrounded by people who adore you.

55:59.857 --> 56:02.317
People who might tell this
girl heart-tugging stories

56:02.401 --> 56:05.401
about how inspired their sons
to join the Navy.

56:06.989 --> 56:11.489
And an inspirational speech that had
everybody in awe, Mr. Obama.

56:13.787 --> 56:14.957
Including you?

56:27.885 --> 56:30.385
It wasn't bad.

56:30.471 --> 56:33.060
You sounded a little professorial.

56:36.644 --> 56:40.234
But you definitely have
a knack for making speeches.

56:42.816 --> 56:44.106
Thank you.

56:48.989 --> 56:53.040
You know, that being said, it didn't hurt
to take you there on our first date.

56:54.536 --> 56:57.076
- Our first what?
- You heard me.

57:00.501 --> 57:04.166
You must have misspoken
because according to you,

57:04.254 --> 57:07.014
this isn't a date until I say so.

57:09.385 --> 57:13.309
You know, if you don't wanna spend any more
time with me today, I'll respect that.

57:13.389 --> 57:16.679
I won't like it,
but I'll respect your wishes.

57:21.105 --> 57:23.975
But if you wanna keep hanging...

57:24.525 --> 57:27.565
let's call it a date
and move on to the next event.

57:27.653 --> 57:31.283
- Next event?
- Drinks and a movie.

57:34.243 --> 57:35.953
You think you're real smooth.

57:36.036 --> 57:38.616
And real cute.

57:40.290 --> 57:42.880
I don't know about the "cute" part.

57:42.960 --> 57:45.460
I mean, they did look good on Dumbo.

57:47.214 --> 57:48.674
Well, I'd rather be Dumbo
than the Wicked Queen.

57:48.757 --> 57:50.297
Wicked Queen?

57:50.384 --> 57:53.432
Now, you can't just say
any old wicked queen.

57:53.512 --> 57:55.682
From which movie?

58:03.022 --> 58:04.568
- There you go.
- Thanks, Steve.

58:04.648 --> 58:08.898
# Why can't nobody love me #

58:10.237 --> 58:13.317
# Like my baby does? #

58:16.076 --> 58:19.576
# Young girl turned out to be two times #

58:19.663 --> 58:22.123
# Twice the woman #

58:22.207 --> 58:24.537
# That I thought she was... #

58:24.752 --> 58:27.462
Don't even come at me
with that "Innervisions" nonsense.

58:27.546 --> 58:29.086
It's a better album all around.

58:29.173 --> 58:31.679
"You and I," "Sunshine of My Life,"

58:31.759 --> 58:33.009
"Superstition."

58:33.093 --> 58:34.890
- All great songs.
- His best.

58:34.970 --> 58:36.350
Not better than "Higher Ground."

58:36.430 --> 58:39.100
"Talking Book" was
the first album I ever heard,

58:39.183 --> 58:41.689
and if it was the last,
I'd be set for life.

58:41.769 --> 58:44.479
- That's how brilliant it is.
- Uh-uh.

58:44.563 --> 58:46.153
Man!

58:46.815 --> 58:50.315
Well, at least we can agree
that Stevie is the best.

58:50.402 --> 58:53.822
- Mm.
- At least we can start from there.

58:59.453 --> 59:03.502
Okay, so what about
that moment in the church

59:03.582 --> 59:05.712
before the meeting?

59:05.793 --> 59:06.922
Which?

59:07.002 --> 59:11.417
I think Bernadette said it,
about you finally dating a sister.

59:13.342 --> 59:15.889
Who knows with those two.
They love to gossip.

59:15.969 --> 59:17.969
- Is it true?
- Is what true?

59:18.055 --> 59:19.635
That you never date black women.

59:19.723 --> 59:21.103
Not true.

59:21.183 --> 59:22.813
But you did date white women?

59:23.769 --> 59:26.689
I've dated a couple of white women, yes.

59:26.772 --> 59:28.612
And which do you prefer?

59:32.945 --> 59:35.565
Come on, buster,
now it's your turn to ante up.

59:42.162 --> 59:44.922
My girlfriend at Columbia was white.

59:45.833 --> 59:47.423
It was pretty serious.

59:48.168 --> 59:50.378
- What was her name?
- Jennifer.

59:51.797 --> 59:53.627
How long were you with Jennifer?

59:54.174 --> 59:56.434
A little over two years.

59:57.261 --> 59:58.931
Mm-hmm...

01:00:03.475 --> 01:00:07.145
Columbia was a strange time in my life.

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:12.727
I was reading a lot, figuring
stuff out, had very few friends.

01:00:12.818 --> 01:00:15.528
- Except for Jennifer.
- Exactly.

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:18.277
She was lovely.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:20.449
She really was.

01:00:21.702 --> 01:00:23.791
She was very caring.

01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:25.411
Kept me company when I was lonely.

01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:31.381
We fell into that private little universe

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:32.711
couples can fall into,

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:36.381
where you develop your own kind of
language and customs, you know?

01:00:38.427 --> 01:00:42.351
I've never had that with anyone
other than my own family.

01:00:42.431 --> 01:00:43.561
It's nice.

01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:51.729
Anyway...

01:00:52.733 --> 01:00:57.741
when we went to visit her family,
they were incredibly gracious to me.

01:00:57.821 --> 01:01:01.618
Very nice, open-minded people,
but, you know, I looked around

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:04.160
at all the pictures
on the walls, you know...

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:06.828
all the white faces...

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:12.127
and I knew I couldn't spend any more
of my life living as an outsider.

01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:17.629
Does that answer your question?

01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:21.219
So, why did you come to Chicago?

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.970
- To try and make a difference.
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:28.805
Thought I would, too.

01:01:28.894 --> 01:01:32.901
I thought maybe I'd work civil cases,

01:01:32.981 --> 01:01:35.611
help women, empower them.

01:01:37.778 --> 01:01:42.120
Being at that meeting today
aroused some of those old dreams.

01:01:43.241 --> 01:01:44.991
Lit some kind of fire.

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:48.790
But those last couple years,

01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:53.126
the corporate firms descend upon
the campus like a pack of wolves.

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:56.211
And they're so appealing.

01:01:57.631 --> 01:02:02.465
I wanted to be in a position to pay
off my loans, pay my folks back.

01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:04.261
Live a little.

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:06.428
Enjoy life.

01:02:06.515 --> 01:02:07.765
There's nothing wrong with that.

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:11.098
There's nothing wrong with it
until there is.

01:02:11.186 --> 01:02:12.726
Yeah. I know what you mean.

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:17.188
I feel like something else
is pulling at me.

01:02:17.776 --> 01:02:19.316
I wonder if I can write books,

01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:23.201
or hold a position
of influence in civil rights.

01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:25.531
- Politics?
- Maybe.

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:30.622
I just wanna do more.

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:33.038
Yeah, so do I.

01:02:35.002 --> 01:02:37.342
And maybe just wanting it
is enough for now.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:46.513
Whatever I end up doing,
I take comfort in knowing

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:48.516
I can't do much worse than my dad did.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:55.482
That doesn't sound like the same guy
who gave that fancy speech earlier.

01:02:56.732 --> 01:02:59.782
The one who talked about
letting go of judgment.

01:03:03.363 --> 01:03:06.413
I've noticed how you talk
about your father.

01:03:08.035 --> 01:03:10.155
Such an angry way to live your life.

01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:13.168
Judging him.

01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:15.328
Living your life against his.

01:03:16.752 --> 01:03:18.802
You're still fighting him.

01:03:19.755 --> 01:03:21.665
But he's not here anymore.

01:03:24.551 --> 01:03:28.221
You said earlier you felt
his life was incomplete.

01:03:30.348 --> 01:03:33.058
Every father's life is incomplete.

01:03:33.769 --> 01:03:35.479
That's why they have sons...

01:03:37.064 --> 01:03:38.734
to finish what they started.

01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:46.660
You know, my grandfather
was not a very generous man.

01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:50.331
He could've helped my dad through college.

01:03:51.078 --> 01:03:54.998
But he was so terrified
of getting into debt,

01:03:55.082 --> 01:03:57.962
he refused to lend him any money.

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:02.922
So my dad had to drop out
of school after a year.

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:09.389
It took a while,
but he forgave my grandfather.

01:04:12.099 --> 01:04:14.179
Then he got his job with the city...

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:19.151
and he has spent the rest of his life
working in that boiler room,

01:04:19.231 --> 01:04:23.528
making sure not to do to his kids
what his father did to him.

01:04:26.988 --> 01:04:28.868
You have to forgive your father...

01:04:30.826 --> 01:04:33.366
so your anger doesn't turn you into him.

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:37.332
You have to forgive him...

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:41.125
so you can be better than him.

01:04:43.004 --> 01:04:44.974
That's what he would want.

01:05:07.154 --> 01:05:09.954
- Get his arm! Get his arm!
- Gary, that's enough!

01:05:11.032 --> 01:05:13.082
Gary, that's enough, man!

01:05:14.578 --> 01:05:16.538
- Gary, that's enough!
- Shut up!

01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:20.827
Radio Raheem! Radio Raheem!

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:22.877
- No!
- Radio!

01:05:24.296 --> 01:05:26.716
Radio Raheem! Radio Raheem!

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:50.606
What's the matter?

01:05:50.697 --> 01:05:52.567
Be careful. I feel a riot coming on.

01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:54.367
Oh!

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:56.371
- I'm gonna use the restroom.
- Okay.

01:06:08.215 --> 01:06:09.585
Michelle?

01:06:10.217 --> 01:06:13.597
It is you. Your height gave you away.

01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:16.258
Avery.

01:06:17.182 --> 01:06:18.522
What are you doing here?

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:21.057
Uh... Picking up groceries.

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:23.400
What do you think? We came to the movies.

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.770
- You did?
- Yeah.

01:06:24.856 --> 01:06:27.726
We partners do that from time to time.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:32.027
And on occasion, we bring along our wives.

01:06:32.113 --> 01:06:37.286
Laura, this is Michelle Robinson,
one of our more tenacious associates.

01:06:37.369 --> 01:06:38.999
Michelle, this is my wife Laura.

01:06:39.079 --> 01:06:40.619
So pleased to make your acquaintance.

01:06:40.705 --> 01:06:41.825
Likewise. Likewise.

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:45.245
I think Avery mentions you
at least a dozen times a day.

01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:47.591
Are you here alone?

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:49.171
Me? Um...

01:06:49.256 --> 01:06:51.626
I'm with a friend.

01:06:51.716 --> 01:06:54.586
Actually, I have to go.

01:06:54.678 --> 01:06:56.548
What did you think of the film?

01:06:56.638 --> 01:06:58.928
What did I think? I liked it.

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:02.135
All the hoopla leading up to it,
I had to see for myself.

01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:06.645
- Oh, what did you think?
- Compelling.

01:07:06.731 --> 01:07:09.611
Though the ending was puzzling
and more than a little infuriating.

01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:17.329
Barack!

01:07:17.409 --> 01:07:18.699
- Avery!
- Wow!

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:21.285
Having a Sidley Austin reunion here.

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:23.541
We just came from a community meeting

01:07:23.623 --> 01:07:25.083
that we attended as colleagues
and friends,

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:27.376
and just thought it might be a good idea
to stop and see the movie

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.550
since it's something
everybody was talking about.

01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:34.301
Um...

01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:36.640
Thank you for that
illuminating explanation.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:39.260
Laura, this is one
of our summer associates,

01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:42.847
a very talented young man, Barack Obama.

01:07:42.934 --> 01:07:44.314
Very pleased to make your acquaintance.

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:46.274
Pleasure's all mine.

01:07:49.983 --> 01:07:51.943
So, you got around to
seeing the movie, I take it?

01:07:52.027 --> 01:07:52.987
Yes, yes, we did.

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:56.905
In fact, I was just explaining to Michelle
how angry that ending made me.

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:59.780
Why would the delivery man
have thrown the trash can

01:07:59.868 --> 01:08:01.448
through his employer's window?

01:08:01.536 --> 01:08:04.616
He must've known his actions
would cause the mob to riot.

01:08:04.706 --> 01:08:06.206
Seemed totally irrational.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.250
Let me put it to you another way, Avery.

01:08:09.336 --> 01:08:10.706
I'm all ears.

01:08:10.795 --> 01:08:13.005
If Mookie hadn't thrown the trash can,

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:15.509
maybe the crowd would've
turned on Sal and his sons.

01:08:15.592 --> 01:08:17.301
So instead of the store being destroyed...

01:08:18.053 --> 01:08:19.723
they might be dead.

01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:23.103
And Mookie knew the insurance
would cover the damage to the store.

01:08:23.183 --> 01:08:24.603
He was saving Sal's life.

01:08:25.769 --> 01:08:28.099
I never would've considered
that perspective, Barack.

01:08:28.188 --> 01:08:31.068
See, that's why we need
a guy like you full-time.

01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:34.569
Michelle, make sure
to treat him real good.

01:08:34.652 --> 01:08:37.032
We want him sticking around.

01:08:37.988 --> 01:08:40.238
- We'll see you both Monday.
- Good night.

01:08:40.325 --> 01:08:41.944
- Good night.
- Night.

01:08:48.582 --> 01:08:51.712
You know I only said that
to make Avery feel better.

01:08:51.795 --> 01:08:54.335
Mookie threw that trash can
'cause he was fucking angry.

01:08:58.051 --> 01:09:00.350
What a coincidence seeing him here.

01:09:01.179 --> 01:09:02.719
It's really wild.

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:06.426
It wasn't a coincidence.
It was cosmic justice.

01:09:07.769 --> 01:09:10.439
I knew damn well going out with you
was the wrong thing to do.

01:09:10.522 --> 01:09:11.522
Pun intended.

01:09:11.606 --> 01:09:13.895
And don't even try to
convince me otherwise, Barack,

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:16.783
because there is nothing you can say.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:19.279
Nothing?

01:09:19.363 --> 01:09:22.577
I can't tell you that Avery doesn't give
a hoot about seeing the two of us out?

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.698
"Make sure to treat him real good."

01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:28.326
That was not okay, Barack, by any measure.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.627
It was smarmy.

01:09:30.707 --> 01:09:33.207
You don't think
that was laced with anything?

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:35.964
You don't think he meant anything by that?

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:39.256
Maybe he did. So what?

01:09:40.801 --> 01:09:44.256
First thing Monday morning he is gonna
spread this juicy little anecdote

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:47.057
around the office like wildfire.

01:09:47.142 --> 01:09:48.229
You know, none of this would've happened

01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:50.899
if you had just respected
the boundaries I laid out.

01:09:50.979 --> 01:09:52.519
But you refused.

01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:55.435
You didn't respect
our working relationship.

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:57.605
And now that's all there's going to be.

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:02.510
I don't want any...

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:21.435
It's pretty good.

01:13:21.522 --> 01:13:22.772
You want some?

01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:25.897
Sure.

01:16:48.396 --> 01:16:54.526
# What goes underneath your armor #

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:59.118
# Underneath your clothes #

01:16:59.198 --> 01:17:03.368
# Do you know? #

01:17:04.704 --> 01:17:08.834
# Let's find out together #

01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:14.586
# Let's find what we're looking for #

01:17:15.756 --> 01:17:19.006
# We'll explore #

01:17:20.678 --> 01:17:25.058
# Leave your house of mirrors #

01:17:25.141 --> 01:17:28.191
# Hear me out #

01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:32.816
# Fear no consequence #

01:17:32.899 --> 01:17:36.859
# Forget your doubts #

01:17:39.322 --> 01:17:43.582
# I don't know where the road leads #

01:17:47.413 --> 01:17:52.843
# You don't know
if I'll break your heart #

01:17:55.588 --> 01:18:00.548
# We don't know how the winds will blow #

01:18:00.635 --> 01:18:04.175
# And we won't know #

01:18:04.263 --> 01:18:08.229
# We won't go #

01:18:08.309 --> 01:18:12.939
# Unless we start #

01:18:15.775 --> 01:18:20.905
# Ooh, start #

01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:29.709
# Fall into the sea #

01:18:29.789 --> 01:18:34.088
# Of possibility #

01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:36.878
# And hope #

01:18:36.963 --> 01:18:41.303
# Letting go #

01:18:42.301 --> 01:18:46.011
# Float away with me #

01:18:46.097 --> 01:18:52.647
# Until we can't see any coast #

01:18:53.396 --> 01:18:57.646
# That we know #

01:18:58.526 --> 01:19:02.276
# Hold on tight until #

01:19:02.363 --> 01:19:06.579
# We become one #

01:19:06.659 --> 01:19:09.869
# Find our island #

01:20:21.734 --> 01:20:26.244
# And I don't know where the road leads #

01:20:27.198 --> 01:20:30.078
# Ooh #

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:35.159
