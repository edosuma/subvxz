WEBVTT

00:15.724 --> 00:16.933
Skadoosh.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.039
Send in my two o'clock.

00:52.385 --> 00:55.638
Your Highness,
we come before you with terrible tidings.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.391
Okay, yeah. What is it? What is it?

00:58.475 --> 01:01.436
We were collecting criminals
for the daily dungeon roundup,

01:01.519 --> 01:03.021
when we were ambushed.

01:03.104 --> 01:03.938
It was…

01:04.022 --> 01:05.940
the Dragon Master.

01:06.816 --> 01:09.069
The former Dragon Master.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.654
Yes, of course, Your Majesty.

01:11.738 --> 01:15.533
Attacking my men.
It feels like he's attacking me!

01:15.617 --> 01:17.327
Would you agree that an attack on you

01:17.410 --> 01:19.746
is just as bad as
an attack on me, personally?

01:19.829 --> 01:22.082
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.

01:22.165 --> 01:25.752
Yep, Po is attacking me,
and that means he's attacking China.

01:25.835 --> 01:29.339
I'd give him a pass, but China?
China won't stand for it.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.800
He is the most powerful warrior
in the land.

01:31.883 --> 01:33.468
What can we do against such might?

01:33.551 --> 01:35.720
You shall do nothing.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.388
You have failed.

01:39.641 --> 01:40.975
We need…

01:45.522 --> 01:47.065
The Forbidden Company!

01:53.363 --> 01:55.406
But, sir, they're forbidden.

01:56.157 --> 01:58.368
Can't unring the chime, so…

02:14.092 --> 02:15.552
It is with a heavy heart

02:15.635 --> 02:19.806
that we send the Forbidden Company
to bring in the former Dragon Master.

02:19.889 --> 02:24.519
Find him, and bring him to me
to face my incomparable judgment.

02:24.602 --> 02:26.479
Oh, and do that spit thing.

02:31.609 --> 02:34.445
Oof. Wouldn't wanna kiss those lips.

02:35.029 --> 02:38.032
-This is going to be fun.

02:48.626 --> 02:52.213
Master Long-Tooth,
the keeper of the Whip of Endless Flame!

02:52.297 --> 02:54.549
Where does your journey lead us?

02:55.133 --> 02:56.467
This children's picture book

02:56.551 --> 02:59.596
is what you're using
to guide my most sacred quest?

02:59.679 --> 03:01.639
Children's picture book?

03:01.723 --> 03:04.142
Children's picture book?! No!

03:04.225 --> 03:07.145
The Time Before Time Saga is for all ages!

03:07.228 --> 03:09.898
That's just what they tell you
to sell more copies.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.195
Thank you, buddy.

03:16.863 --> 03:20.575
You must have had a story you read as
a kid that's followed you your whole life.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.535
Something your parents read you to sleep?

03:22.619 --> 03:25.580
What makes you think this story
is based on the Tianshang Weapons?

03:25.663 --> 03:28.666
Oh, man,
I'm so glad you asked.

03:28.750 --> 03:32.921
-Oh no.
-For the answer is in the pages.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.258
It was the time before times,

03:37.342 --> 03:40.303
when the old world was
still newer than old and new.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.264
-What does that mean?
-Doesn't matter. Sounds cool.

03:44.390 --> 03:47.101
Master Long-Tooth was
one of the most powerful warriors

03:47.185 --> 03:48.686
to fight in the Great War.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.189
She wielded the Whip of Endless Flame,

03:51.272 --> 03:53.691
which burned so bright
it could cut through the Earth!

03:54.984 --> 03:56.653
Sound familiar?

03:57.237 --> 03:58.738
Yes.

03:58.821 --> 04:00.406
Anyway, she was the coolest.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.785
When the Great War ended,
the whole world was broken.

04:11.459 --> 04:15.129
She realized that the whip was
too powerful for any warrior to wield.

04:15.213 --> 04:16.839
It had to be destroyed.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.677
That would be her quest,
and her greatest challenge.

04:21.344 --> 04:25.556
So no one would find it
and use its evil power ever again!

04:25.640 --> 04:29.185
Again, again, again…

04:29.269 --> 04:30.311
That's it?

04:30.395 --> 04:33.815
Well… Yeah, I mean, it's a lot cooler
when you actually read it.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.321
The Great War broke the world,
just like in the scroll.

04:41.155 --> 04:43.658
The author, Li Gao,
is a huge history buff.

04:43.741 --> 04:45.702
He's clearly based
Master Long-Tooth's whip

04:45.785 --> 04:47.662
on one of the Tianshang Weapons.

04:47.745 --> 04:51.332
We just need the final issue
to find out where she hid it. But…

04:51.416 --> 04:54.335
-So surprised there's a "but."
-It hasn't been released yet.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.463
So - big idea
that makes me super valuable -

04:57.547 --> 04:59.757
we're gonna go talk to the author himself.

04:59.841 --> 05:00.842
Wonderful.

05:00.925 --> 05:04.846
I do so love to put my trust into
the hands of children's entertainment.

05:04.929 --> 05:06.306
Hard same!

05:08.141 --> 05:09.475
Uh, hangin'.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.283
Li Gao is infamously secretive.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.827
He's only revealed
the location of his workshop

05:27.910 --> 05:30.413
to the Time Before Time Saga Fan Club.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.832
Lucky for you, I'm a member.

05:32.915 --> 05:33.916
So lucky.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.215
-Whoa!

05:44.218 --> 05:47.346
This is even better than I imagined.

05:47.430 --> 05:51.267
Is this one of those dreadful fairs
they had during the Renaissance? Ugh!

05:52.852 --> 05:55.605
Hardcore fans gather here
and celebrate all the time.

05:55.688 --> 05:58.983
I can't wait!

05:59.067 --> 06:01.069
Well, you're gonna have to.

06:01.944 --> 06:04.697
I'm wanted by the Emperor?

06:05.364 --> 06:08.534
I've always wanted to be wanted,
but not like this.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.620
If they catch you,
they'll take me as well,

06:10.703 --> 06:13.122
and I can't let anything
get in the way of my mission.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.958
Stay hidden.
I'll talk to the author myself.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.810
Who puts wanted posters on a ceiling?

06:39.941 --> 06:43.027
-Hm…

06:44.445 --> 06:46.656
-Hiyah!

06:46.739 --> 06:47.573
Subtle.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.992
And who exactly are you supposed to be?

06:50.076 --> 06:51.702
-I am…

06:51.786 --> 06:54.122
-Master Bamboozle!

06:55.414 --> 06:57.458
You've been bamboozled.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.544
Sweet. Yeah.

07:00.211 --> 07:01.629
Master B is a fan favorite.

07:01.712 --> 07:04.298
With this costume,
I blend in even more than you do.

07:04.382 --> 07:07.552
Fine. But keep a low profile.

07:19.230 --> 07:23.693
Ooh, limited edition comics.
If we each get one, we can be twinsies.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.154
Oh!

07:28.489 --> 07:31.659
They made the dumplings
look like Master Trillobite!

07:31.742 --> 07:34.245
They're Trillo-bite-sized. Huh?

07:34.328 --> 07:36.831
Po! I told you to keep--

07:39.167 --> 07:42.587
While you're buying dumplings
that look like your favorite fake people,

07:42.670 --> 07:45.506
my home and my real people are in danger.

07:46.382 --> 07:49.844
-Enough with this absurd comic book!

07:52.221 --> 07:55.183
Now look who's drawing
too much attention.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.518
Cool armor!

08:00.438 --> 08:01.981
Whoa! Is that a costume of--

08:02.064 --> 08:04.901
Master Mastodon, from book seven.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.319
Made it myself.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.696
Nice Bamboozle.

08:09.405 --> 08:10.406
You wanna fight?

08:10.990 --> 08:14.577
Master Mastodon,
have mercy!

08:17.205 --> 08:19.665
I win, I get your armor.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.923
Whoa! It's metal!

08:30.468 --> 08:32.053
Did you make that?

08:34.639 --> 08:37.475
You're a real warrior, aren't you?

08:41.229 --> 08:43.397
Ow! Hey!

08:44.106 --> 08:46.567
You let someone actually touch your sword?

08:46.651 --> 08:49.487
She's a little girl. I'm not a monster.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.489
See? This stuff isn't all bad.

08:51.572 --> 08:54.158
Po. Focus on the plan ahead.

08:55.785 --> 08:58.037
-Cool, cool, cool.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.540
Totally cool.
I'm fully on mission right now--

09:01.040 --> 09:01.999
What?!

09:02.083 --> 09:03.751
That's it.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.171
Gao's workshop!

09:30.778 --> 09:32.738
Hey, my cart!

09:34.198 --> 09:37.577
I've been dreaming
about this day since I was a kid.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.415
Gao can tell us where the Lost City is,
he'll sign my book,

09:42.498 --> 09:46.210
then he'll probably wanna write a series
about Wandering Po and Wandering Blade,

09:46.294 --> 09:48.838
sign a few more books,
and then it's back on track.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.340
You're not getting that signed.

09:51.424 --> 09:55.136
I'd think someone in
a Bamboozle costume would know.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.220
Know what?

09:56.762 --> 09:59.223
Gao died three months ago.

10:02.351 --> 10:04.520
I thought you were
a fan of this author's works?

10:04.604 --> 10:07.523
I was. I-I am! I just…

10:08.107 --> 10:11.068
Wow. This is so sad.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.404
Will you people just go home?!

10:13.487 --> 10:18.200
My father is dead.
There are no more books. It's done!

10:18.284 --> 10:21.454
So get out of here and leave me alone!

10:24.040 --> 10:25.750
Gao has a son?

10:25.833 --> 10:27.168
Gao has a son!

10:27.251 --> 10:29.462
Maybe he knows
the location of the Lost City.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.800
Hi there. Huge fan of--

10:36.636 --> 10:38.679
No, no, no, you don't understand.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.598
We're on a mission--

10:41.641 --> 10:45.811
You fans think you own my father.
But you don't.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.563
He's my dad.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.733
I just want some peace and quiet.

10:50.816 --> 10:54.779
So get away from my house,
before I sound the alarm!

10:57.573 --> 11:00.701
You don't understand.
We're on a mission to stop

11:00.785 --> 11:03.704
the Whip of Endless Flame
from falling into the wrong hands.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.832
Everything Master Long-Tooth
worked for is at stake.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.168
Your father knew where that whip ended up,

11:09.251 --> 11:11.754
and if the final issue
is in that workshop,

11:11.837 --> 11:13.756
it could save China!

11:16.092 --> 11:19.220
Oh, it's always life and death
with you fanboys.

11:19.303 --> 11:23.057
Mark my words:
no one is getting into that workshop,

11:23.140 --> 11:26.394
and no one will ever touch
that final issue.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.526
-Oh, man…

11:33.609 --> 11:36.195
-What are you so happy about?

11:36.278 --> 11:37.822
Weren't you listening?

11:37.905 --> 11:41.033
He just admitted
the final issue is up there.

11:41.117 --> 11:41.951
Blade, we--

11:42.451 --> 11:44.328
-Blade?

11:48.124 --> 11:49.834
Blade, what are you doing?!

12:08.018 --> 12:08.853
Sh!

12:15.651 --> 12:17.903
Awesome!

12:18.487 --> 12:19.822
Stay focused.

12:19.905 --> 12:22.450
We just need to find the book and get out.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.742
Whatever you say.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.176
Are you kidding me?

12:40.759 --> 12:43.471
Invading my father's workspace?

12:43.554 --> 12:45.097
Enough is enough.

12:45.681 --> 12:47.475
I'm sounding the alarm.

13:07.077 --> 13:08.120
Please! Gao Junior.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.705
It's Lao.

13:09.788 --> 13:12.124
Lao. Everything
your dad wrote about is real.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.418
If we don't read that comic,
we're all gonna die.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.670
You really are crazy, aren't you?

13:17.254 --> 13:18.797
We just want to read it.

13:22.259 --> 13:23.469
Unhand that!

13:25.346 --> 13:26.347
-Wait!

13:29.808 --> 13:30.643
No! No!

13:30.726 --> 13:34.563
Please.
You gotta help us stop the two weasels.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.732
-If they--

13:39.818 --> 13:41.654
-No!
-No!

13:43.155 --> 13:45.074
I haven't read it yet.

13:45.157 --> 13:46.992
I haven't read it yet!

13:48.744 --> 13:51.121
You haven't read your dad's final comic?

13:55.251 --> 13:59.088
My dad and I,
we always read the first drafts together.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.840
But then… he died.

14:02.841 --> 14:06.262
This is
the last thing of his I'll ever read.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.182
And I'm just not ready for it to be over.

14:10.266 --> 14:13.727
Now, get out. Get out!

14:21.193 --> 14:22.027
Please.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.280
It's all I have of my father.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.158
This sword belonged to my brother.

14:28.742 --> 14:30.411
It's all I have left of him.

14:33.122 --> 14:38.460
It always seemed too precious to wield,
so for years, I didn't.

14:39.503 --> 14:40.629
It was his sword,

14:40.713 --> 14:41.964
not mine.

14:42.506 --> 14:47.261
And if I were to use it, it would mean
he really wasn't coming back.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.890
But this sword
was meant to be swung.

14:50.973 --> 14:55.185
Its purpose is to defend the helpless,
the way my brother did.

14:56.854 --> 14:59.398
And books are meant to be read.

15:06.238 --> 15:08.574
Lao, son of Gao.

15:09.158 --> 15:12.328
Your father may have written
something that could save the world.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.414
Please, let us read this book.

15:19.084 --> 15:19.919
Would…

15:20.002 --> 15:22.171
Would you like to read it with me?

15:23.631 --> 15:25.507
It would be an honor.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.262
Not you.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.389
Uh, okay, okay. Just, you know,

15:32.473 --> 15:35.309
read it out loud and
describe the pictures real good?

15:42.566 --> 15:46.111
At long last,
Master Long-Tooth reached the Lost City.

15:47.237 --> 15:49.448
She was ready to seal the whip away,

15:49.531 --> 15:52.534
bury it deep
where it would be lost to time.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.537
But then, she received a vision.

15:56.163 --> 15:59.375
Simply hiding the whip
would be a fool's mistake.

15:59.458 --> 16:02.461
Unless she shared
knowledge of this weapon's danger,

16:02.544 --> 16:05.506
future generations
would inevitably find it,

16:05.589 --> 16:07.508
and repeat her mistakes.

16:08.133 --> 16:13.180
Instead, she passed her tale on
to the people of the Lost City,

16:13.263 --> 16:16.725
who watched over
the endless flame forevermore.

16:17.267 --> 16:20.354
For the only way
to truly complete a story…

16:23.107 --> 16:26.110
"…is to share it with others."

16:35.494 --> 16:37.830
I shouldn't keep his work to myself.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.373
It deserves to be shared.

16:39.873 --> 16:41.458
Mm-hm.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.003
Thank you, brave warrior.

16:44.586 --> 16:45.421
And you,

16:45.504 --> 16:46.463
loud nerd.

16:46.964 --> 16:47.798
Hey…

16:47.881 --> 16:51.844
Lao. The book mentions
a Lost City where the whip is hidden.

16:52.386 --> 16:54.722
Do you think your father
knew how to get there?

16:56.890 --> 16:58.475
Hm…

16:59.393 --> 17:00.269
Oh?

17:02.771 --> 17:03.689
Oh…

17:15.701 --> 17:17.536
I knew this looked familiar.

17:18.537 --> 17:22.958
In the Endless Desert, a hundred miles
south of here, past the spice market,

17:23.042 --> 17:26.628
there's a mountain range
that looks just like this.

17:28.130 --> 17:31.633
My dad used to take me
all the time when I was a kid.

17:32.634 --> 17:34.970
He must have known I'd recognize it.

17:37.639 --> 17:40.684
Dad stuff,
and geeky Easter eggs.

17:41.185 --> 17:44.146
Kill me. Aw, man.

17:46.106 --> 17:47.357
Walk the road south

17:47.441 --> 17:51.278
until you see a mountain range
that looks just like this one.

17:51.361 --> 17:54.698
Once you cross it,
I bet you'll find your city.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.369
This map is for you.

17:59.453 --> 18:02.831
-The rest is for everyone else.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.965
You know, this isn't half bad.

18:12.049 --> 18:14.259
He has
a flourish for fight scenes.

18:14.843 --> 18:17.387
It was cool
seeing you open up today.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.681
To Lao. To that little girl.

18:20.516 --> 18:24.520
You know, if you ever wanna
talk about stuff with me, you can.

18:24.603 --> 18:25.854
I mean, I'm right here.

18:26.438 --> 18:27.940
What are you scheming?

18:28.023 --> 18:29.024
I mean, I think…

18:29.733 --> 18:30.567
thought…

18:30.651 --> 18:32.111
we were becoming friends?

18:32.611 --> 18:36.281
All that stuff, talking, sharing things
with each other, that's what friends do.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.790
I was eight years old
when my brother died.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.836
He was trying to arrest
Klaus and Veruca, and they--

18:49.503 --> 18:52.631
-They killed him. Right in front of me.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.425
I'm finishing what my brother could not.

18:55.509 --> 18:57.678
So I can't be your friend, Po.

18:57.761 --> 19:00.973
Because if I ever had to choose
between you and the mission,

19:01.056 --> 19:02.516
it will be the mission.

19:02.599 --> 19:04.017
Every time.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.396
I'm sorry.

19:08.730 --> 19:10.149
I'm sorry too.

19:10.232 --> 19:13.443
-Dragon Master!

19:33.338 --> 19:35.132
More of your Emperor's men?

19:35.215 --> 19:37.718
The toughest and most forbidden he's got.

19:37.801 --> 19:41.346
We are the Forbidden Company,
and you are under arrest,

19:41.430 --> 19:43.724
Dragon Master.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.809
There's no Dragon Master here.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.437
-This is… Master Bamboozle.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.480
-You've been…
-Ah!

19:50.564 --> 19:52.441
-Bamboozled.

19:54.526 --> 19:58.280
Uh, guys, this is all
a big misunderstanding.

19:58.363 --> 20:02.201
I'm trying to save China.
I'm trying to do my job.

20:08.790 --> 20:11.460
Hey! Watch the civilians!

20:47.329 --> 20:48.163
Whoa!

21:19.569 --> 21:21.321
You messed with the wrong lady.

21:21.405 --> 21:22.948
She's a knight.

21:43.343 --> 21:44.636
Blade!

22:02.863 --> 22:05.907
Leave her. We just need the panda.

22:23.508 --> 22:26.261
If I ever had to choose
between you and the mission…

22:31.099 --> 22:32.517
It will be the mission.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.561
Every time.

22:35.854 --> 22:36.688
Blade?
