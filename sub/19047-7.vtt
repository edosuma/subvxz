- Yeah. I did--
I did every one of 'em.

19:46.386 --> 19:49.320
I even did one while she
was wrapping up right here.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.355
Look.

[ Laughing ]

19:53.927 --> 19:58.329
- Why did you do that, dude?
- Because poop is funny.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.864
[ Laughing ]

19:59.866 --> 20:03.067
- Well, I guess poop
is pretty funny.
- Poop is funny.

20:03.069 --> 20:05.336
Poopin' on the floor
like that--
That was a good one.

20:05.338 --> 20:09.974
You know what?
Well played, my man.
Very well played.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.610
[ Laughing ]
That's funny.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.545
I hate my life.
Yeah.

20:14.547 --> 20:17.415
Seriously, dude.
Don't ever poop
in our bed again.
