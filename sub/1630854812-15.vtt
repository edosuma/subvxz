that was going on,

03:03.150 --> 03:04.151
why would she pick that up?

03:04.218 --> 03:06.019
- A bed of roses.

03:06.086 --> 03:07.487
Thanks, babe.

the [bleep] craziness tonight,

Shh. No.

03:29.576 --> 03:31.945
No.
It's just with us right now.

03:32.012 --> 03:35.315
And she was gonna live with
the engagement tonight only.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.618
- Yeah.
- She wants the smoke tomorrow.

03:37.684 --> 03:40.721
- I don't know why she
would want smoke with JWOWW.

03:40.787 --> 03:42.189
- It never ends with that girl.

03:42.256 --> 03:43.790
It's like the end of the movie
when the villain dies,

03:43.857 --> 03:45.425
and then, like,
at the last scene, like,

03:45.492 --> 03:46.660
put their hand up.

03:46.727 --> 03:47.995

Like, I wanna go to bed.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.434
I want no part of this.

03:54.501 --> 03:57.037
Well, maybe next year,
I'll have a--

03:57.104 --> 03:58.172
a real birthday.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.373
You know, right?

03:59.439 --> 04:00.407
From when they said
happy birthday,

04:00.474 --> 04:01.842
we went on the stripper bus.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.243
We sat down at the restaurant.

04:03.310 --> 04:04.278
I had a good run.

04:04.344 --> 04:05.746
It was a--it was a good 36,

04:05.812 --> 04:07.181
37 minutes of a birthday.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.150
The strippers were all right.

04:10.217 --> 04:11.552
- Can I just touch
on one thing, though?

04:11.618 --> 04:14.454
- Sure.
- I hate to be like, like--

04:14.521 --> 04:16.390
but it was a thing.

04:16.456 --> 04:17.591

04:17.658 --> 04:20.027
We just met this guy.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.128
- How long have
you had the ring?

04:21.195 --> 04:22.796
I have to know.

04:22.863 --> 04:26.166
We went from a stripper bus
to this.

04:26.233 --> 04:27.868
[laughs]

04:27.935 --> 04:30.337
- I saw it
with my own two eyes.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.372
I'm trying to not think
about what happened

04:32.439 --> 04:33.740
with Jenni and Zack.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.476
I'm like, just full-on
pissed off at this point,

04:36.543 --> 04:39.079
that Jenni has ruined
another moment for me.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.747
We just got engaged,

04:40.814 --> 04:44.718
and I'm trying
to [bleep] explain myself.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.153
Why would I do that?

04:46.220 --> 04:47.421
- It was kind of like
we gave them, like,

04:47.487 --> 04:48.956
a crash course
of our relationship.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.757
- You wanna get married
on the stripper bus?

04:52.426 --> 04:54.461
When are you taking out
your IUD?

04:54.528 --> 04:55.629

04:55.696 --> 04:57.164

knocked up soon.

- Right.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.438
- I don't care if I know you
for 24 hours.

05:04.505 --> 05:05.906
I wanna marry you,
I wanna marry you.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.008

05:12.713 --> 05:13.814
That's sad.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.649
She could act
like it's not real.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.217
She could say
I'm a [bleep] liar

05:17.284 --> 05:18.218
all she wants.

05:18.285 --> 05:19.620
- Well, that's on them.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.221
- But you and I saw
what we saw.

05:21.288 --> 05:22.556
- Correct.

05:22.623 --> 05:23.991
- I just wanted to just
bring up one more thing.

I have to [bleep] do it
for my own sanity.

05:31.265 --> 05:32.599
Because I can't keep
living like this.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.034
- I wouldn't even sweat it.
- And another thing,

05:34.101 --> 05:35.903

one more thing.

07:14.168 --> 07:19.406
- I cannot [bleep] believe
what happened.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.241
- Yeah, that was wild.

07:21.308 --> 07:22.609
- I can't believe it.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.011
We just met him.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.646
We just burned
her wedding dress.

07:25.712 --> 07:26.813
- Did you hear him say,

07:26.880 --> 07:27.981
"I was gonna do it
the other day"?

07:28.048 --> 07:29.383
But like, when,

07:29.449 --> 07:31.585
when we were in the [bleep]
cemetery in cloaks,

07:31.652 --> 07:33.420
burning her wedding dress?

07:33.487 --> 07:34.588
Like--

07:34.655 --> 07:35.856
- There was beef
in the streeters.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.024
- What do you mean?

07:37.090 --> 07:38.358
- Beef in the streets.

07:38.425 --> 07:40.227
- Again?
What happened?

07:40.294 --> 07:42.229
- Angelina was just
proposed to,

07:42.296 --> 07:45.566
but then she goes,

07:45.632 --> 07:47.668
"I looked at a snapshot
in the room,

07:47.734 --> 07:52.039
"and Jenni and Zack
wasn't happy for me.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.608
And I want to say something."

07:54.675 --> 07:57.411
And she was, like,
emphatic about it.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.912
We're gonna have to fix this.
- Don't.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.582
- You know what I mean?
I have to at least tell Jenni.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.183
I think it could be
a simple conversation.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.419
I really do.
- No, you're not telling Jenni.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.653
You're gonna tell Jenni?

08:06.720 --> 08:09.523
- You know, any more time
that elapses,

08:09.590 --> 08:12.192
it turns to me not being
a good friend.

08:12.259 --> 08:15.062
And if we were to leave NOLA
with some unsettled beef,

08:15.128 --> 08:18.098
or something
that I withheld from Jenni,

08:18.165 --> 08:19.333
that's not a good situation.

08:19.399 --> 08:20.934
- Why do you have
to be the mediator?

08:21.001 --> 08:22.703
Let someone else mediate.

08:22.769 --> 08:24.571
- So we just planned
her divorce party.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.173
Now we gotta plan a wedding?

08:26.240 --> 08:29.142
I'm not--I'm not gonna be
a [bleep] bridesmaid.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.911
I'm sitting it out.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.079
Nope.

08:32.145 --> 08:37.117
- I think a conversation
should be had.

08:37.184 --> 08:40.153
And if it goes well,
we'll be fine.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.722
[suspenseful music]

08:41.788 --> 08:42.856
- No.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.191
Oh, my God.

08:44.258 --> 08:45.759
It's like a dangerous position
for you to be in.

08:45.826 --> 08:46.927
- It is.

08:46.994 --> 08:47.861
- I might have
to go back to sleep.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.162
- It was the craziest thing.

08:49.229 --> 08:52.499
I sat my ass
in the [bleep] chair,

08:52.566 --> 08:55.169
and immediately,
my [bleep] vision

08:55.235 --> 08:56.503
went zoot, like that.

08:56.570 --> 08:59.139
And I was like,
there it is, shade.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.974
She was not happy for me.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.543
You didn't have to be
a brain surgeon.

09:02.609 --> 09:03.944
Like, I felt it.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.013
- [clears throat]

09:06.079 --> 09:07.648
[dramatic music]

09:07.714 --> 09:08.916
Oh, my goodness.

09:08.982 --> 09:12.052
Who knew that NOLA would
bring out the mediation?

09:12.119 --> 09:14.454
[line trilling]
And after all this time,

09:14.521 --> 09:16.990
I think it's time
to throw my cape on

09:17.057 --> 09:18.425
and save this [bleep].

09:20.794 --> 09:22.362
- Hello, neighbor.

09:22.429 --> 09:23.597
- Hi, neighbor.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.799
Uh, can you meet me
at the cast suite?

09:25.866 --> 09:27.501
- Yeah, sure can.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.703
- All right, boo.
Bye.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.806
We are going to address
everything here in NOLA.

09:32.873 --> 09:36.810
No extra baggage will be
on the plane back to Jersey.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.779

09:44.318 --> 09:46.086
- Just when you thought
the beef was over,

09:46.153 --> 09:47.387
they pulled you back in.

09:47.454 --> 09:50.490
- I was never [bleep]
negative one second!

09:50.557 --> 09:51.959
- Don't.
Don't take it this far.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.994
- I saw the shade.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.262
- That's not what happened.

09:55.329 --> 09:57.164
- This is the wedding
all over again.

09:57.231 --> 09:58.699
- Here I am again,
being the wrong one.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.234
- It seems like you want
the smoke right now.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.536

10:18.385 --> 10:19.419
Goodbye.

10:20.687 --> 10:21.855
- Nicole?

10:21.922 --> 10:23.190
- Dee?
- Hey.

10:23.257 --> 10:24.925
My goodness, what a night.

10:24.992 --> 10:25.959
- It was fun.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.160
Angelina's engaged.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.363
- What the hell?
- What the [bleep]?

10:29.429 --> 10:30.364
That's weird.
- I mean,

10:30.430 --> 10:31.365
I'm really happy for her.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.466
- I'm so happy for her.

10:32.533 --> 10:33.634
I love Vinny.

10:33.700 --> 10:34.868
But that was crazy.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.436
- Yeah, I wasn't expecting it.

10:36.503 --> 10:37.638
- Engaged?

10:37.704 --> 10:39.439
Like, she just met this guy.

10:39.506 --> 10:41.742
- They move fast
over there in Staten Island.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.310
- Oh, good morning.
- Good morning.

10:43.377 --> 10:44.578
What's happening?
- Bruh,

10:44.645 --> 10:46.213
where did you disappear
to last night,

10:46.280 --> 10:48.448
for, like, 17 hours?

10:48.515 --> 10:49.550
What happened?
Where did--

10:49.616 --> 10:50.984
you were outside with Angelina?

10:51.051 --> 10:53.787
- Yes.
I was trying to, um,

10:53.854 --> 10:56.790
like, button up
this vacation and--

10:56.857 --> 10:58.859
- End on a positive?
- Yes.

10:58.926 --> 11:02.663
She apologized for, uh,
some of the arguments

11:02.729 --> 11:04.798
that we have gotten over
the past couple of weeks.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.099
- Oh, great.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.503
I am so happy
Angelina apologized to Mike.

11:09.570 --> 11:11.171
There is no more drama.

11:11.238 --> 11:13.807
We can all go home,
like, happy.

11:13.874 --> 11:17.344
- It was just what happened
after that which was weird.

11:17.411 --> 11:19.746
- What happened?

11:19.813 --> 11:20.914
- She was like, "Listen.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.817
When Vinny got down
on one knee,"

11:23.884 --> 11:26.920
she said, "I took
a snapshot of the room."

11:26.987 --> 11:28.522
- Oh, my God!

11:28.589 --> 11:32.860
- Oh, my God!

11:32.926 --> 11:34.728
- [bleep] off.
- No.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.730
- She goes,
"Lauren was crying."

11:36.797 --> 11:38.031
- Oh, my God.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.533
- "Deena and Chris:
happy for me."

11:39.600 --> 11:42.002
- Yeah!

11:42.069 --> 11:43.871
- She goes,
"Pauly: happy.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.639
Our Vinny: sad."
- Aww.

11:45.706 --> 11:48.041
- Which, obviously, it's funny.
- Yeah.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.277
- Then she went
to you and Zack.

11:50.344 --> 11:52.212
And she said--
- I was like this.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.881
[indistinct shouting]

11:53.947 --> 11:55.649
- She goes, "Jenni?

11:55.716 --> 11:56.984
She wasn't happy for me."

11:57.050 --> 11:59.019
She was like,
"Jenni and Zack are a hater."

11:59.086 --> 12:00.287
- Hater?
- Yeah.

12:00.354 --> 12:01.889
- I was shocked!

12:01.955 --> 12:05.092
- I'm like, "Listen, I came
out here to button this up."

12:05.158 --> 12:06.226
- Yeah.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.961
- "And now you're"--

12:08.028 --> 12:09.263
- Re-stirring new [bleep]...
- Yes.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.464
Yes.
- As we're leaving.

12:10.531 --> 12:12.699
It's like she settled
beef with Mike

12:12.766 --> 12:15.536
and then, like,
played Ping-Pong in her head

12:15.602 --> 12:17.538
to find someone else
to have a problem with.

12:17.604 --> 12:18.939
Like, she can't be happy.

12:19.006 --> 12:20.941
Who's taking a snapshot
of everyone in the room

12:21.008 --> 12:22.342
to get their feelers?

12:22.409 --> 12:24.144
I would be in the moment.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.313
- Yeah, last night,
when Mike and I were outside

12:26.380 --> 12:28.849
for an hour,
I was telling Mike how I felt.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.250
But I kept saying to him,

12:30.317 --> 12:32.252
"Do not say anything
to anybody."

12:32.319 --> 12:34.354
Please, don't say anything.
Don't say nothing.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.690
- She says, quote, unquote,
"I want all the smoke."

12:36.757 --> 12:38.225
I was like,
"Yo are you serious?"

12:38.292 --> 12:39.459
- [sighs]
- Like, "With JWOWW?"

12:39.526 --> 12:41.161
- Then I quit.
- No, no.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.162
But no, but then--

12:42.229 --> 12:43.197
- No, but I'm literally like,

12:43.263 --> 12:44.531
I just quit.
- No. No. No.

12:44.598 --> 12:47.167
- I was genuinely happy
for her last night.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.203
I--I don't know
where the [bleep]

12:49.269 --> 12:50.771
this is coming from.

12:50.838 --> 12:53.307
Like, I have no idea
what the [bleep] I did wrong.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.809
If you took a true snapshot
of the room,

12:55.876 --> 12:57.744
I'm pretty sure
I shedded two tears.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.947
So if you wanna ignore
all of that

13:00.013 --> 13:02.316
and take a snapshot
of another moment,

13:02.382 --> 13:04.518
or whatever you wanna do,
or the fact

13:04.585 --> 13:07.554
that I was dumbfounded
like everyone else, so be it.

13:07.621 --> 13:10.157
- Everyone's faces looked,
like, super shocked.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.558
- I think we were super shocked

13:11.625 --> 13:13.060
'cause it was the first time
we met him.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.261
- Yes.
- And then they're engaged.

13:14.328 --> 13:16.196
And she doesn't really
tell us anything.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.464
- It was just crazy.
We were just--

13:17.531 --> 13:19.499
she just burned the dress.

13:19.566 --> 13:20.667
He should have got down
on one knee

13:20.734 --> 13:22.102
while they were burning
the dress.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.437
- I was thinking that, too.
But it was at a cemetery.

13:23.504 --> 13:24.771
It might be weird.
- Yeah.

13:24.838 --> 13:27.207
- I still think we can fix it.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.775
- I don't wanna fix it.
- Come on.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.244
- I don't wanna fix it.
- Come on.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.411
- I don't wanna.
I just wanna go home.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.746
I wanna take my kids
to the store.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.114
- Come on.
- I promised them.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.549
- You can't leave like that.
That's ridiculous.

13:35.616 --> 13:38.018
- No, I can.
I'm over it.

13:38.085 --> 13:40.487
- I just felt that,
out of the whole entire table,

13:40.554 --> 13:43.156
Jenni and I went
through similar situations.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.958
- It's almost, you guys
are in the same shoes.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.093
- Same shoes.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.395
- Maybe you have
to speak your mind to it

13:48.462 --> 13:49.930
and tell her how you feel.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.265
- Yeah.
- I think that would help.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.766
- I do think,
at some point,

13:52.833 --> 13:54.368
Jenni and I have to have
a conversation.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.503
Because here we are
again, you know?

13:56.570 --> 13:58.071
But this is a different beast.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.540
- If anyone should say
something, it should be you

13:59.606 --> 14:01.208
'cause it's how you felt.

14:01.275 --> 14:02.643
- Exactly.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.244
- I think I'm gonna take
my mic off

14:04.311 --> 14:05.479
and get my kids and leave.

14:05.546 --> 14:07.214
- I--I--I think
it's more of just--

14:07.281 --> 14:08.782
- I'm not doing this.
- Yeah.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.350
- I'm not being part of it.

14:10.417 --> 14:13.620
And my mic can be put down,
and I will go home peacefully.

14:13.687 --> 14:14.955
[dramatic music]

14:15.022 --> 14:16.723
- Okay.
I--I'm--

14:16.790 --> 14:18.525
- Because this ain't it.
- I'm hearing you.

14:18.592 --> 14:20.227
I'm hearing you.
- She should be happy.

14:20.294 --> 14:22.229
- I'm hearing you.
- Everyone's happy for her.

14:22.296 --> 14:24.731
You have no idea

14:24.798 --> 14:26.300
how angry I am right now.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.335
And I'm just tired of it.

14:28.402 --> 14:30.137
I'm tired of it.

14:30.204 --> 14:31.672
I am not getting dragged down

14:31.738 --> 14:33.640
into one of her weddings again.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.008
I'm done.

14:35.075 --> 14:38.579
- Jenni is getting
visibly upset right now.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.047
I don't think you need
to take it this far.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.348
I think it's just
a simple conversation.

14:41.415 --> 14:43.350
- But, like, why is it--
- Don't take it this far.

- I love you, Ange.

21:48.308 --> 21:50.043
- And then Zack did say,

21:50.110 --> 21:51.712
"Wait, how long you been
with her for?"

21:51.778 --> 21:54.648
- How long have you guys
officially been together?

21:54.715 --> 21:57.484
- Then, I look across from you,
and you said to Vin,

21:57.551 --> 21:59.386
"When did you get that ring?"

21:59.453 --> 22:00.521
- How long have
you had the ring?

22:00.587 --> 22:01.755
I have to know.
- I just got it

22:01.822 --> 22:03.123
right before I left,
just in time.

22:03.190 --> 22:04.958
- Is that a bad question
to ask?

22:05.025 --> 22:06.059
- I don't know.
We just--

22:06.126 --> 22:07.194
I just felt like--

22:07.261 --> 22:08.562
- You're spiraling
in your head.

22:08.629 --> 22:10.063
Nothing is negative here.
- I just wanted to know

22:10.130 --> 22:11.632
how long he had it planned for.
- We were just asking

22:11.698 --> 22:13.734
normal questions that I would
ask one of my best friends.

22:13.800 --> 22:14.701
- I know you guys were
all in shock.

22:14.768 --> 22:15.969
- When'd you get the ring?

22:16.036 --> 22:17.004
- Do you believe
Angelina's engaged?

22:17.070 --> 22:18.172
- She's like, I need someone

22:18.238 --> 22:19.706
to pick up
the [bleep] cat litter.

22:19.773 --> 22:21.475
It's just like--

22:21.542 --> 22:22.776
- Yeah.

22:22.843 --> 22:24.711
- This is the wedding
all over again.

22:24.778 --> 22:26.847
- It's not.
- It is.

22:26.914 --> 22:27.981
- I just feel like
this is, like,

22:28.048 --> 22:29.716
a repeat of, like, the wedding.

22:29.783 --> 22:31.585
Like, yes, we [bleep] up
with the speech,

22:31.652 --> 22:32.719
but then, like,

22:32.786 --> 22:34.821
it just consumed
her whole night.

22:34.888 --> 22:36.089
- That was so [bleep]-up.

22:36.156 --> 22:37.524
That's [bleep] gross!

22:37.591 --> 22:39.059
- Ange, calm down.
I don't wanna ruin our wedding.

22:39.126 --> 22:41.528
- Can you take your camera crew
out of my [bleep] face?

22:41.595 --> 22:43.530
- So I feel like this is
happening again,

22:43.597 --> 22:46.200
where she thinks Jenni was,
like, mad.

22:46.266 --> 22:48.001
- When I got,
like, proposed to,

22:48.068 --> 22:50.270
Jenni and Zack were, like,
a little weirded out.

22:50.337 --> 22:51.538
- Oh, snap.

22:51.605 --> 22:53.307
- What the [bleep]?
Are you kidding me?

22:53.373 --> 22:54.775
- Then that ruined
her whole engagement night.

22:54.842 --> 22:56.043
- You got engaged.

22:56.109 --> 22:57.611
You should have just
enjoyed your night.

22:57.678 --> 22:59.213
You're in your own head, Ange.

22:59.279 --> 23:01.048
Like, what is
happening here?

23:01.114 --> 23:03.617
Honestly, I just feel like
I'm in the twilight zone.

23:03.684 --> 23:04.918
- Jenni,
you were looking at me,

23:04.985 --> 23:06.320
and I was, like,
looking at you,

23:06.386 --> 23:07.521
and you were looking at me,
and I was like,

23:07.588 --> 23:08.755
what the actual--is she mad?

23:08.822 --> 23:09.823
Like, is she upset about this?

23:09.890 --> 23:11.158
Like, I did think that.

23:11.225 --> 23:13.193
- Angelina, I'm sorry,
but none of that is real.

23:13.260 --> 23:15.195
It's in your head.
- These are my feelings though.

23:15.262 --> 23:16.697
- I know.
I think your--

23:16.763 --> 23:18.232
that's not real.

23:18.298 --> 23:19.533
- Okay, whatever.

23:19.600 --> 23:20.667
I know what I know.

23:20.734 --> 23:22.102
- Angelina, you said you kept

23:22.169 --> 23:23.403
this relationship private

23:23.470 --> 23:25.172
and you didn't tell us
on purpose.

23:25.239 --> 23:28.041
So how were we supposed
to know when you got together?

23:28.108 --> 23:29.643
We just met him yesterday.

23:29.710 --> 23:32.713
We were truly wondering,
when did you meet him?

23:32.779 --> 23:34.147
When did you start dating?

23:34.214 --> 23:35.816
- When you know, you know.
It doesn't matter.

23:35.883 --> 23:37.017
I could meet him yesterday.
- I said that.

23:37.084 --> 23:38.218
But I said that.
- But we're not judging.

23:38.285 --> 23:39.219
- I just said that.

23:39.286 --> 23:40.587
- I hate
when this family fights.

23:40.654 --> 23:44.491
And I'm frustrated
because I am so confused.

23:44.558 --> 23:45.792
- We want you to be happy.

23:45.859 --> 23:47.027
- I'm not trying
to make this a big thing.

23:47.094 --> 23:48.862
I'm really not.
It was just, I felt--

23:48.929 --> 23:50.731
- But it is when you went
to Mike instead of her.

23:50.797 --> 23:52.833
- Well, of course I--
he pulled me outside.

23:52.900 --> 23:54.201
And immediately,
he was the only one

23:54.268 --> 23:56.570
that was there next to me,
so I was like, wait.

23:56.637 --> 23:58.605
Did I just see--like,
did I hear that, see that?

23:58.672 --> 24:01.275
- Okay, but then, go to her.
- It's not fair to me.

24:01.341 --> 24:03.610
Like, we're trying to get
to know someone we just met...

24:03.677 --> 24:04.778
Oh, hi.
Nice to meet you.

24:04.845 --> 24:06.213
- Nice to meet you.
How you doing?

24:06.280 --> 24:08.649
- That proposed to you
on our roommate's birthday.

24:08.715 --> 24:10.617
- It's Vinny's birthday!

24:10.684 --> 24:11.818
- I love you, Ange.

24:11.885 --> 24:14.087
And I hope that you'll
marry me.

24:14.154 --> 24:16.023
- Call us curious
because we're trying

24:16.089 --> 24:19.059
to get to know someone
that just inserted himself

24:19.126 --> 24:20.460
into this family.

24:20.527 --> 24:23.530
- The thing is,
is that when Zack acts like,

24:23.597 --> 24:25.399
"Wait, how long have
you guys been together?"--

24:25.465 --> 24:27.668
- But truly, me and Zack
just met him yesterday.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.169
- I know.
And I get that.

24:29.236 --> 24:31.171
- We were all just genuinely
happy for you, honestly.

24:31.238 --> 24:32.673
- And that's what I want.
I want that.

24:32.739 --> 24:33.841
- But that is it!

24:33.907 --> 24:35.442
That's it!

24:35.509 --> 24:37.010
- Then--
then I'm a [bleep], then.

24:37.077 --> 24:40.280
I'm a psycho.
- Everybody is [bleep] happy!

24:40.347 --> 24:42.216
- I think we were all happy--
happy for her

24:42.282 --> 24:44.251
and a certain level of shock,
as well.

24:44.318 --> 24:46.086
- For sure. For sure.
- Everyone was shocked.

24:46.153 --> 24:47.654
I think it's just,
for some reason,

24:47.721 --> 24:49.456
still singling out Jenni.

24:49.523 --> 24:50.624
Like, why?

24:50.691 --> 24:51.825
- I just don't know
what happens now.

24:51.892 --> 24:53.227
- Well, I can tell you
what happens now.

24:53.293 --> 24:54.394
- What?
- She can stay and get

24:54.461 --> 24:55.729
her ass beat...
both: Stay and get

24:55.796 --> 24:57.030
her ass beat,
or stay and get her ass beat.

24:57.097 --> 24:58.765
- I mean, yes.
- You know what I'm saying?

24:58.832 --> 25:01.201
There's only three options.
There's three options.

25:01.268 --> 25:02.970
- Let's do a flashback
to Miami.

25:03.036 --> 25:04.438
- I wanna be cool
with everyone here.

25:04.505 --> 25:05.939
I don't even want any problems.

25:06.006 --> 25:07.875
- But you can't be cool
if you keep talking [bleep].

25:07.941 --> 25:09.243
- I'm telling you,
I'm not talking [bleep].

25:09.309 --> 25:10.444
- You wanna get
your [bleep] beat,

25:10.511 --> 25:11.645
you get your [bleep] beat.

25:11.712 --> 25:12.946
You can stay,
get your [bleep] beat,

25:13.013 --> 25:14.047
you can stay and get
your [bleep] ass beat.

25:14.114 --> 25:14.982
- Okay.
- You can stay and get

25:15.048 --> 25:16.216
your [bleep] ass beat.

25:16.283 --> 25:17.518
- All right, okay.
- Plain and simple.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.786
- I don't know where
we go from here, boys.

25:19.853 --> 25:21.655
- I say we go
to Newark Airport.

25:21.722 --> 25:22.656
- Yeah.

25:22.723 --> 25:24.491
- Not one person feels...

25:24.558 --> 25:25.592
- Not one person said
anything negative.

25:25.659 --> 25:27.194
- Any way the way
you're feeling.

25:27.261 --> 25:28.595
- Okay.
- You're doing what you did

25:28.662 --> 25:29.596
at your wedding night.

25:29.663 --> 25:31.031
- I didn't, though.
I'm not.

25:31.098 --> 25:32.399
- You're sabotaging
your own happiness right now.

25:32.466 --> 25:33.567
- But I'm not.
- But she's taking me

25:33.634 --> 25:34.568
and Zack down with her.
- You are.

25:34.635 --> 25:35.869
- Where are the girls?

25:35.936 --> 25:37.538
- Deena said they were going
to the suite.

25:37.604 --> 25:39.473
- Dude, why are we always
the ones that--

25:39.540 --> 25:40.941
- Get left in the dark?
- Yeah.

25:41.008 --> 25:42.643
- Pauly said
he was gonna text us,

25:42.709 --> 25:44.111
but I never got a text.

25:44.178 --> 25:46.246
- We're on a highway
over open water.

25:46.313 --> 25:47.347
We're not sure
where we're going.

25:47.414 --> 25:49.116
We do not have clear direction.

25:49.183 --> 25:50.984
It's a lot like San Diego.
Do you remember that?

25:51.051 --> 25:53.020
I texted Jenni an hour ago,
at this point.

25:53.086 --> 25:54.488
Should we call them?

25:54.555 --> 25:55.956
- They're probably
just catching up.

25:56.023 --> 25:58.458
- And then they were all
in the room, fighting?

25:58.525 --> 26:00.527
- This whole trip,
there was no big beefs.

26:00.594 --> 26:02.429
- No.
- It's the last day.

26:02.496 --> 26:03.830
Like, this is check-out day.

26:03.897 --> 26:06.266
- Nobody knows about
your relationship, Ange.

26:06.333 --> 26:08.435
We're just trying to know it.
That's it.

26:08.502 --> 26:10.070
- Why are you crying right now?

26:10.137 --> 26:11.104
- Because you hurt her!

26:11.171 --> 26:12.472
- I'm not trying
to take you down.

26:12.539 --> 26:14.374
- ♪♪ And it's all
just a little bit ♪♪

26:14.441 --> 26:16.610
♪♪ Of history repeating ♪♪

26:23.083 --> 26:25.319
- ♪♪ You better do it,
do it, do it ♪♪

26:25.385 --> 26:27.221
♪♪ Do it, do it, do it ♪♪

26:27.287 --> 26:29.556
- Ange, if you have
an issue with any of us,

26:29.623 --> 26:31.825
you feel a certain way,
come to us.

26:31.892 --> 26:33.193
- I understand.
- If I'm, like, annoyed

26:33.260 --> 26:34.428
with her, I'd be like...
- But when I was outside--

26:34.494 --> 26:35.896
- I'm annoyed.
- In my mind,

26:35.963 --> 26:38.198
I was thinking about all of it
as it was going down.

26:38.265 --> 26:39.633
- Spiraling in your head,
like you do.

26:39.700 --> 26:41.068
- It's not even--
I would say, maybe spiraling,

26:41.134 --> 26:42.636
but I would say, also,
I'm thinking about,

26:42.703 --> 26:44.037
like, did that just happen?

26:44.104 --> 26:46.173
I watched everything
transpire around the table.

26:46.240 --> 26:47.641
I watched it, Mike.
- Wow.

26:47.708 --> 26:50.944
- But Jenni and Zack--it
wasn't like, happiness for me.

26:51.011 --> 26:52.145
- I feel you.

26:52.212 --> 26:53.580
- Who the [bleep]
is anyone to judge?

26:53.647 --> 26:55.215
- Okay, and if it's really
annoying you

26:55.282 --> 26:56.617
and it's in your head,
you go up to her.

26:56.683 --> 26:58.252
- You guys were--I understand,
but you know what?

26:58.318 --> 26:59.620
I'm sorry.
Am I wrong?

26:59.686 --> 27:01.488
Like, here I am again,
being the wrong one.

27:01.555 --> 27:02.956
Like, I'm sorry
I didn't pull her aside.

27:03.023 --> 27:04.892
- Angelina, stop.
- But these are my feelings.

27:04.958 --> 27:06.260
Stop trying
to [bleep] take away

27:06.326 --> 27:07.494
my feelings just like Mike.

27:07.561 --> 27:08.662
- [bleep] your feelings,
Angelina.

27:08.729 --> 27:11.131
You just ruined
everything for me.

27:11.198 --> 27:12.499
You wanna talk
about feelings?

27:12.566 --> 27:13.734
Choke on those.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.068
- Stop trying to take away
my feelings.

27:15.135 --> 27:16.370
- We're not trying
to take away your feelings.

27:16.436 --> 27:18.305
- I can't believe
she's still looking for beef

27:18.372 --> 27:19.606
with Jenni out of nowhere.

27:19.673 --> 27:21.275
- I think it could be
easily solved.

27:21.341 --> 27:22.543
- No.
- No?

27:22.609 --> 27:23.544
- How?
- No.

27:23.610 --> 27:24.711
It's been, like, 15 years.

27:24.778 --> 27:26.013
This [bleep]
never getting solved.

27:26.079 --> 27:28.015
- We genuinely love you
and this is crazy.

27:28.081 --> 27:29.349
- Okay.

27:29.416 --> 27:32.686
- I bet you the girls are
trying to plan, like,

27:32.753 --> 27:34.454
like a real engagement party.

27:34.521 --> 27:36.823
- Like, instead of enjoying
your engagement night,

27:36.890 --> 27:38.959
you're pinning in
and not even in the club

27:39.026 --> 27:40.127
with your fiancé.

27:40.194 --> 27:41.495
You're outside,

27:41.562 --> 27:44.064
talking about
how Jenni's not happy for you.

27:44.131 --> 27:47.100
- Or Angelina might
be talking about, like,

27:47.167 --> 27:49.136
what she did
the first time around

27:49.203 --> 27:50.938
that maybe she won't do, or--

27:51.004 --> 27:52.906
- That's a good point.
- You know?

27:52.973 --> 27:57.211
- You mean she doesn't wanna
get [bleep] Dutch ovened?

27:57.277 --> 27:59.279
- Okay, Angelina,
say all the things

27:59.346 --> 28:00.647
that you hated
in your marriage.

28:00.714 --> 28:02.015
This is your funeral.

28:02.082 --> 28:04.384
- I never want a man again
that Dutch ovens me.

28:04.451 --> 28:05.385
- Wait.
Wait.

28:05.452 --> 28:07.087
- [bleep] got very specific.

28:07.154 --> 28:09.122
- We're literally dressed
in cloaks around a fire

28:09.189 --> 28:10.724
and she's talking
about Dutch ovens.

28:10.791 --> 28:12.459
[laughter]

28:12.526 --> 28:15.295
- And then 2.0 was like,
yup, I'll propose to that.

28:15.362 --> 28:16.997
- It was a very nice moment.

28:17.064 --> 28:18.599
We don't know Vinny that well.
- I get it.

28:18.665 --> 28:20.000
I get it.
- But we're happy

28:20.067 --> 28:21.168
that you're happy.

28:21.235 --> 28:22.503
- Yeah.
- I just want--

28:22.569 --> 28:24.404
- We just didn't expect him
to propose to you.

28:24.471 --> 28:25.772
But we're happy for you.

28:25.839 --> 28:27.474
- Yeah, we're so happy.
- Nothing is negative.

28:27.541 --> 28:29.243
There's no negativity.
- Love is a crazy thing.

28:29.309 --> 28:31.345
- There's no negativity at all.
- It's crazy.

28:31.411 --> 28:32.613
- I just don't wanna
see you cry.

28:32.679 --> 28:34.581
I'm upset that--
I'm upset that you're upset.

28:34.648 --> 28:36.483
Like, I can't--like, I sat--
I'm like--

28:36.550 --> 28:37.784
[tense music]

28:37.851 --> 28:39.853
It's like, all right.

28:39.920 --> 28:42.155
Sorry I made you cry.

28:42.222 --> 28:43.924
Sorry--here I am, again,

28:43.991 --> 28:46.326
saying sorry for things

28:46.393 --> 28:48.395
that I shouldn't
be saying sorry for

28:48.462 --> 28:49.997
and eating crow.

28:50.063 --> 28:51.932
I'm always eating crow.

28:51.999 --> 28:54.635
- I just think moving forward,
if you have any, like,

28:54.701 --> 28:58.505
weird feeling about any of us,
just, like, come up to us

28:58.572 --> 29:00.340
and be like, are we good?

29:00.407 --> 29:01.642
- Yeah, I should have--
- Like, this I how I felt.

29:01.708 --> 29:02.709
- I should have came up
to you last night

29:02.776 --> 29:03.644
and said, "Are we good?"
- Yeah.

29:03.710 --> 29:04.711
- But I didn't.

29:04.778 --> 29:05.646
- And then she would have
told you,

29:05.712 --> 29:06.847
"I'm genuinely happy."

29:06.914 --> 29:08.048
You know?
- Yeah.

29:08.115 --> 29:09.816
- We were all so happy.

29:09.883 --> 29:10.951
- I think that all of us,

29:11.018 --> 29:14.121
if we all get together
as a unit,

29:14.188 --> 29:15.556
we can solve this thing.

29:15.622 --> 29:16.657
- I don't know what to do.

29:16.723 --> 29:18.025
- It's the not knowing for me.

29:18.091 --> 29:19.560
- [laughing] Yeah.

29:19.626 --> 29:21.328
It's the drama for me.

29:21.395 --> 29:22.829
I mean, I thought
this trip was over.

29:22.896 --> 29:23.964
Like, I have a plane to catch.

29:24.031 --> 29:25.966
Like, miss me with that drama.

29:26.033 --> 29:27.201
- I think we got
to check on the ladies.

29:27.267 --> 29:28.468
- Yeah, let's see
where their heads are at.

29:28.535 --> 29:29.703
- Yep.

29:29.770 --> 29:32.372
I'm trying to leave NOLA
on positive vibes.

29:32.439 --> 29:34.041
- I hope they're not fighting.
- What can go wrong?

29:34.107 --> 29:36.543
- There's gotta be a solution
to this situation here.

29:36.610 --> 29:38.078
- Hey, boys.
- That's it.

29:38.145 --> 29:39.947
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

29:40.013 --> 29:41.415
- What y'all talking about?

29:45.719 --> 29:46.687
[tense electronic music]

29:46.753 --> 29:48.222
- Definitely bad vibes

29:48.288 --> 29:49.389
in this room right now.

29:49.456 --> 29:50.824
- Before we leave
and get out of here,

29:50.891 --> 29:52.659
did I not say something
to you about,

29:52.726 --> 29:53.994
please don't say anything?

29:54.061 --> 29:55.829
- Oh! Yes!
- Whoa!

29:55.896 --> 29:57.898
- Don't say nothing.
Please, don't say anything.

29:57.965 --> 29:59.266
You might have, like,
a big mouth,

29:59.333 --> 30:01.201
but like, just don't say
anything right now.

30:01.268 --> 30:03.303
- Funny, he left that part out.
- What are you talking about?

30:03.370 --> 30:04.738
- Oh, it's about to get good.
- Yeah.

30:04.805 --> 30:06.340
- I'm an idiot.
- No, no.

30:06.406 --> 30:07.541
- Because you brought me
outside

30:07.608 --> 30:09.243
and we had
a conversation about us.

30:09.309 --> 30:10.644
And then I'm thinking
to myself,

30:10.711 --> 30:12.346
I can trust you
with information.

30:12.412 --> 30:14.781
And I can't.
both: Oh!

30:14.848 --> 30:16.683
- Yeah!
- I knew it. I knew it.

30:16.750 --> 30:18.285
- This is the beef I want.
- I knew it. I knew it.

30:18.352 --> 30:19.386
- This is the beef I want.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:19.453 --> 30:20.554
- I knew it. I knew it.

30:20.621 --> 30:21.655
- Yeah.
Yeah, get him.

30:21.722 --> 30:22.956
Get him.
Get him, Ange.

30:23.023 --> 30:25.459
Angelina says that
she can't trust Mike.

30:25.526 --> 30:26.793
But who trusts Mike?

30:26.860 --> 30:28.095
- The [bleep]?
- You two got a track record.

30:28.161 --> 30:29.396
- Yeah.
- You should have definitely--

30:29.463 --> 30:30.664
- I should have
definitely thought that.

30:30.731 --> 30:31.965
- You guys should have
a lawyer present.

30:32.032 --> 30:33.267
- I'm an idiot.

30:33.333 --> 30:35.769
- I tried to handle this
the best I could.

30:35.836 --> 30:38.405
And I felt the more time
that it went by

30:38.472 --> 30:39.806
and me not tell JWOWW,

30:39.873 --> 30:41.241
I was not being
a good friend to her.

30:41.308 --> 30:44.011
And that's the truth
of the matter, okay?

30:44.077 --> 30:45.279
- But then what about
what I asked you?

30:45.345 --> 30:46.547
You weren't being
a good friend to me.

30:46.613 --> 30:48.215
both: Oh!
- No. No, no, no.

30:48.282 --> 30:49.716
I was. I--

30:49.783 --> 30:50.984
- Here we are again.

30:51.051 --> 30:52.119
- JWOWW comes first.
- I knew it.

30:52.186 --> 30:53.353
I knew it.
- JWOWW comes first.

30:53.420 --> 30:54.488
- There's no beef right now.

30:54.555 --> 30:56.323
You're about to get
confrontational?

30:56.390 --> 30:57.791
You don't want smoke from me.

30:57.858 --> 30:59.259
both: Oh!

30:59.326 --> 31:01.261
- Mike, you don't want
no [bleep] smoke with me, bro.

31:01.328 --> 31:02.529
Like, get the hell out of here.

31:02.596 --> 31:03.897
- It seems like you want
the smoke right now.

31:03.964 --> 31:06.166
- Oh, I want--
paws up, [bleep]!

31:06.233 --> 31:08.368
Paws up, [bleep]!

31:08.435 --> 31:10.737
- I don't know where we go
from here because of Jenni.

31:10.804 --> 31:12.005
She's distraught right now.

31:12.072 --> 31:13.207
- Jesus Christ.

31:13.273 --> 31:14.541
Two of us are going
in the elevator.

31:14.608 --> 31:15.909
Only one of us mother[bleep]
are coming out.

31:15.976 --> 31:18.212
- Why does she do this?
- Right?

31:18.278 --> 31:19.680
- What a cluster[bleep].

31:19.746 --> 31:21.248
- You all right?
- No.

31:21.315 --> 31:22.883
No, not even close.

31:29.389 --> 31:33.026
- ♪♪ Yeah, I'm outta my mind ♪♪

31:33.093 --> 31:35.562
♪♪ I'm outta my mind ♪♪

31:35.629 --> 31:37.497
- Like, I have never seen
this side of Angelina.

31:37.564 --> 31:41.802
I haven't seen her
with someone who, like,

31:41.869 --> 31:45.305
calms her down and, like,
she's normal.

31:46.273 --> 31:47.541
- I don't know, man.

31:47.608 --> 31:49.243
- I did not mean it
to get to this at all.

31:49.309 --> 31:52.112
I'm like-- I told you
not to [bleep] make it a--

31:52.179 --> 31:53.714
like, how did you explain it
to them?

31:53.780 --> 31:55.649
- Angelina's like, playing
whack-a-mole right now.

31:55.716 --> 31:58.051
It's like Jenni, Mike,
Jenni, Mike.

31:58.118 --> 31:59.786
- I thought that we made up
last night.

31:59.853 --> 32:01.021
- Uh--
- It seems like you want

32:01.088 --> 32:02.022
the smoke right now.

32:02.089 --> 32:03.524
- Oh.
- Yo!

32:03.590 --> 32:04.758
- Wait, wait, wait.

32:04.825 --> 32:06.226
You don't want smoke
from me, actually.

32:06.293 --> 32:07.594
- He can't help it.
- Oh, wow.

32:07.661 --> 32:08.996
- He can't help himself.

32:09.062 --> 32:10.230
- Two of us are going
in the elevator.

32:10.297 --> 32:11.431
Only one of us [bleep]
are coming out.

32:11.498 --> 32:12.432
- Yo.

32:12.499 --> 32:13.901
How did Angelina being engaged

32:13.967 --> 32:16.503
for the fourth time turn
into World War III?

32:16.570 --> 32:17.938
- Uh-huh.
- Just listen to me.

32:18.005 --> 32:20.774
I said that I am not going
to say anything tonight

32:20.841 --> 32:22.976
because we're going
to stay positive.

32:23.043 --> 32:24.578
You just got engaged, too.

32:24.645 --> 32:27.080
Let's live in that moment.
I said--

32:27.147 --> 32:28.582
- For five to six
business hours.

32:28.649 --> 32:30.350
- No.
- Yeah, and that was about it.

32:30.417 --> 32:32.052
- And then you said,
"As long as you don't

32:32.119 --> 32:34.288
tell JWOWW tonight"--

32:34.354 --> 32:36.823
- So did you wake up and run
and then, like...

32:36.890 --> 32:38.692
- No.
- Immediately, like group text?

32:38.759 --> 32:39.860
- No.

32:39.927 --> 32:41.762
- Of course, you know,
I was a fool

32:41.828 --> 32:43.897
to believe that Mike would keep
his [bleep] mouth shut.

32:43.964 --> 32:45.599
He lives and breathes
for this [bleep].

32:45.666 --> 32:46.733
- The coffee in the morning?

32:46.800 --> 32:48.702
Ah, it's gonna be a good day.

32:48.769 --> 32:50.204
I think I smell it in the air.

32:50.270 --> 32:52.105
He's like--
- Oh, my God.

32:52.172 --> 32:53.207
- All right, stop it.

32:53.273 --> 32:54.875
- I can't wait.
- Is Jenni awake?

32:54.942 --> 32:57.077
- His wheels were turning,
boy, all night.

32:57.144 --> 33:00.547
You woke up like Dr. Evil,
drinking your coffee, going,

33:00.614 --> 33:03.150
"Ha, when am I gonna start
this [bleep]?"

33:03.217 --> 33:05.986
- I told you, I let you sit

33:06.053 --> 33:07.554
for the night
with the engagement.

33:07.621 --> 33:09.022
We took it positive,
even in the conversation--

33:09.089 --> 33:10.357
- He gave you the night.
Give him that.

33:10.424 --> 33:11.391
He gave you the night.
- Thank you for that.

33:11.458 --> 33:12.793
I appreciate you.
- And also,

33:12.860 --> 33:14.728
I was trying
to leave this trip in NOLA

33:14.795 --> 33:16.230
on a positive note.
- I don't know.

33:16.296 --> 33:17.598
I don't know.
- I think I kept--

33:17.664 --> 33:18.699
- It sounds like you're
telling yourself that.

33:18.765 --> 33:20.334
- I--God.
- I don't know.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.236
- God!
- I don't know.

33:24.404 --> 33:25.672
- [laughs]
- Don't--

33:25.739 --> 33:26.874
- I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

33:26.940 --> 33:29.042
- Yo.
- It's been a trip.

33:29.109 --> 33:30.844
I actually have to go
because of my flight.

33:30.911 --> 33:32.946
Don't get me wrong,
I had a great trip.

33:33.013 --> 33:35.883
It was so much fun celebrating
all the celebrations.

- Bye, I love you.

ending it like this?

33:56.937 --> 33:58.238
Okay?
- Wow, you see that?

33:58.305 --> 33:59.873
- Yeah?
- I don't think she's okay.

- Ooh.

34:09.416 --> 34:11.084

by all of this.

34:11.151 --> 34:13.954
And I'm just like--
everything happened so quickly.

34:14.021 --> 34:17.291
I'm very, very, very sorry
if I made you feel hurt,

34:17.357 --> 34:19.259
if I hurt you
in any type of way.

I can't, man.
