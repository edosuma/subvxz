WEBVTT

00:01.542 --> 00:03.834
PREVIOUSLY ON
DAWSON'S CREEK...

00:03.834 --> 00:04.834
JOEY, WE WON...

00:04.834 --> 00:05.834
THE BOSTON
FILM FESTIVAL.

00:05.834 --> 00:08.291
I WAS HOPING THAT YOU
WOULD PRODUCE AGAIN.

00:08.291 --> 00:09.917
I DON'T THINK I CAN.
I...

00:09.917 --> 00:12.708
MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR
A LITTLE IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR

00:12.708 --> 00:13.667
FOR A CHANGE, DAWSON.

00:13.667 --> 00:16.000
[LAUGHS]

00:16.000 --> 00:18.291
ONE MINUTE YOU'RE
LAUGHING, AND THE NEXT
YOU'RE IN TEARS.

00:18.291 --> 00:20.000
I'M FINE, JACK.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.291
MAYBE IT'S TIME YOU WENT
BACK ON YOUR MEDICATION.

00:22.291 --> 00:25.417
MY MOTHER AND MY SISTER,
THEY DEPEND ON ME
TO BE THE ROCK. ME.

00:25.417 --> 00:26.333
I UNDERSTAND IT.

00:26.333 --> 00:28.041
I JUST WISH YOU'D
LET ME HELP YOU.

00:32.667 --> 00:34.500
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE SAYING THIS.

00:34.500 --> 00:38.834
I MEAN, AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
OF HIDING BEHIND HIGHBROW
ANALYTICAL POSTURING--

00:38.834 --> 00:41.500
I'M SAYING IT.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.917
I LOVE YOU.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.291
I--I KNOW
IT'S NONSENSICAL.

00:45.291 --> 00:46.875
"NONSENSICAL"? IT'S INSANE.

00:46.875 --> 00:48.667
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR 15 YEARS.

00:48.667 --> 00:51.625
YOU COULDN'T FIND SOME OTHER
TIME TO FREUDIAN SLIP THIS CAT
OUT OF THE BAG?

00:51.625 --> 00:54.375
I'VE WANTED TO...
SO MANY TIMES.

00:54.375 --> 00:57.000
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW LONG I'VE BEEN
WRESTLING INTERNALLY

00:57.000 --> 00:59.625
WITH THE PSYCHOLOGICAL
REPERCUSSIONS
OF MY FEELINGS.

00:59.625 --> 01:01.041
I NEED SOME TIME TO PROCESS.

01:01.041 --> 01:05.000
I MEAN, MY ELECTRICAL SYNAPSES
ARE ON OVERLOAD HERE.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.875
MY BRAIN IS TELLING ME
ONE THING, BUT MY HEART,

01:07.875 --> 01:09.166
IT SAYS ANOTHER.

01:09.166 --> 01:12.834
IT'S TELLING ME THAT I SHOULD
CONSIDER THE UNEQUIVOCAL,

01:12.834 --> 01:16.542
HIGHLY IRRATIONAL,
POSSIBLY DAMAGING
PROPOSITION OF...

01:16.542 --> 01:18.542
OF LOVING YOU BACK.

01:18.542 --> 01:23.166
WAIT...

01:27.041 --> 01:28.291
YOU MISSED A LINE.

01:28.291 --> 01:30.250
YOU FORGOT
HYPNOTICALLY SCARRING...

01:30.250 --> 01:32.125
SO IF YOU WANT IT DONE
RIGHT, YOU GET AN ACTOR.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.041
I'M NOT EXACTLY COMFORTABLE
PLAYING THE GIRL HERE.

01:34.041 --> 01:35.458
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

01:35.458 --> 01:38.083
I MEAN, DO YOU
THINK IT WOULD MAKE
A GOOD MOVIE?

01:38.083 --> 01:40.542
YOU WRITE
IN TOO MANY SYLLABLES.

01:40.542 --> 01:42.417
AND WHAT'S WITH ALL THIS
PSYCHOBABBLE INSIGHT?

01:42.417 --> 01:43.750
HOW MANY TEENAGERS
DO YOU KNOW
THAT TALK LIKE THAT?

01:43.750 --> 01:47.542
SYLLABLES ASIDE,
DO YOU THINK IT WILL
MAKE A GOOD MOVIE?

01:47.542 --> 01:51.083
YEAH, YEAH. HOWEVER,
YOU DID MAKE JOEY A LITTLE
BIT ON THE ANGRY SIDE,

01:51.083 --> 01:52.291
EVEN FOR HER.

01:52.291 --> 01:53.250
[LAUGHS]

01:53.250 --> 01:54.875
THAT'S NOT JOEY.

01:54.875 --> 01:57.375
RIGHT. THAT'S NOT JOEY,
THE GUY'S NOT YOU,

01:57.375 --> 01:59.750
AND YOU'RE NOT DISSECTING
YOU TWO'S RELATIONSHIP
ON THE PAGE

01:59.750 --> 02:02.417
JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER
NARCISSISTIC WRITER
THROUGH HISTORY.

02:02.417 --> 02:05.250
JUST TELL ME
WHAT YOU THINK.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.917
WELL, I THINK IT'S DARK.

02:06.917 --> 02:08.125
IT'S OBTUSE.

02:08.125 --> 02:09.875
IT'S VERY UN-DAWSON LEERY.

02:10.875 --> 02:12.291
THANK YOU.

02:12.291 --> 02:16.417
I...THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO WRITE
SOMETHING

02:16.417 --> 02:17.750
THAT'S NOT
JUST PLOT DRIVEN,

02:17.750 --> 02:19.458
BUT ALSO
EMOTIONALLY DRIVEN.

02:19.458 --> 02:23.208
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'RE EVOLVING AS
AN ARTIST.

02:23.208 --> 02:25.542
IT'S ABOUT TIME I TOOK
SOME RISKS, YOU KNOW.

02:25.542 --> 02:26.792
RIDE THE EDGE A LITTLE.

02:26.792 --> 02:30.375
WELL,
IF THAT'S THE CASE,
I DO HAVE ONE NOTE.

02:30.375 --> 02:32.500
WHICH IS?

02:32.500 --> 02:34.625
WHY DON'T THEY HAVE SEX?

02:34.625 --> 02:36.625
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU AND
JOEY NEVER DID
IN REAL LIFE,

02:36.625 --> 02:37.583
BUT THIS IS A FILM.

02:37.583 --> 02:38.458
YOU CAN WRITE IT ANY WAY
YOU WANT.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.792
YOU KNOW,
TAKE THE RISKY PLUNGE.

02:40.792 --> 02:42.375
AH, SEE, I HAVE.

02:42.375 --> 02:44.750
HOW MANY MOVIES DO YOU
SEE WHERE A BUNCH
OF HORNY TEENAGERS

02:44.750 --> 02:47.333
JUST GO AT IT
LIKE RABBITS? HUH?

02:47.333 --> 02:48.583
I MEAN, THAT'S
THE SAFE CHOICE.

02:48.583 --> 02:52.959
THE RISKY, EDGIER CHOICE
IS TO HAVE THEM NOT DO IT.

02:52.959 --> 02:56.959
ONLY YOU TAKE YOUR
VIRGINAL INSECURITIES
AND FEAR OF DEFLOWERMENT

02:56.959 --> 02:58.500
AND TURN THEM INTO
RISKY, EDGY BEHAVIOR.

02:58.500 --> 03:01.333
OH, YEAH, I HAVE NO
PROBLEM BEING A VIRGIN.

03:01.333 --> 03:04.959
I'M SORRY IF MY...CONFIDENCE
AND MY CONVICTIONS
DISCOMBOBULATE YOU.

03:04.959 --> 03:08.291
"DISCOMBOBULATE"?

03:08.291 --> 03:09.834
HOW MANY SYLLABLES
IS THAT?

03:59.959 --> 04:03.333
[♪♪♪]

04:13.625 --> 04:16.625
Jen: HEY, WE'RE
HOLDING AUDITIONS
FOR A MOVIE TODAY

04:16.625 --> 04:17.666
HOPE YOU CAN MAKE IT.

04:17.666 --> 04:18.834
HEY.
HEY, YOU.

04:18.834 --> 04:20.750
SO HOW'S INTEREST?
ARE WE GONNA HAVE
A TURNOUT?

04:20.750 --> 04:22.166
AS A FIRST-TIME PRODUCER,

04:22.166 --> 04:25.083
MY INSTINCTS TELL ME WE'RE
GONNA HAVE A HUGE TURNOUT,
DAWSON.

04:25.083 --> 04:26.291
COOL.

04:26.291 --> 04:26.959
WE'RE HOLDING AUDITIONS
FOR A MOVIE TODAY.

04:26.959 --> 04:29.208
COME ON BY, ALL RIGHT?

04:29.208 --> 04:30.750
YOU'RE SUCH A NATURAL.
YOU'RE SO GOOD AT THIS.

04:30.750 --> 04:32.000
OH, THANKS.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.583
DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH.
I MEAN, I'M NO JOEY.
PLEASE.

04:34.583 --> 04:37.375
SHE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY EXPERIENCE EITHER
WHEN SHE FIRST STARTED.

04:37.375 --> 04:38.333
YOU'RE GONNA BE GOOD.

04:38.333 --> 04:40.667
I HAVE THE UTMOST
CONFIDENCE IN YOU.

04:40.667 --> 04:44.667
WHY, THANK YOU.
MR. WRITER SLASH DIRECTOR.

04:44.667 --> 04:45.792
[LAUGHS]

04:45.792 --> 04:47.834
HEY, BE SURE YOU GET
A FLIER TO JAMES LOWELL.

04:47.834 --> 04:49.000
HE'D BE PERFECT FOR
THE LEAD.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.125
EW!
EW?

04:52.125 --> 04:54.583
JEN, HE'S LIKE
THE CLASSIC LEADING GUY.

04:54.583 --> 04:56.917
HE'S KIND, HE'S FUNNY,
HE'S SELF-EFFACING.

04:56.917 --> 04:58.458
HE'S LIKE JIMMY STEWART
MEETS TOM HANKS.

04:58.458 --> 05:02.500
YEAH, AND ABOUT AS SEXY
AS A BUCKET, DAWSON.

05:02.500 --> 05:03.542
OK.

05:03.542 --> 05:06.542
NOW, DAVE FACHELLI,
THAT'S A LEADING MAN.

05:06.542 --> 05:07.542
EXCUSE ME?

05:07.542 --> 05:10.208
YEAH, HE'S LIKE DARK
AND BROODING AND...

05:10.208 --> 05:14.458
RAY LIOTTA MEETS--
SEWER RAT. NO WAY.

05:14.458 --> 05:16.625
I'M JUST SAYING HE'S GOT
A CERTAIN...APPEAL.

05:16.625 --> 05:19.625
I MEAN, PEOPLE DON'T
NECESSARILY GO TO THE MOVIES

05:19.625 --> 05:22.500
TO SEE THEIR KIND, SWEET,
NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.959
THEY GO TO SEE THAT
SLIGHTLY DANGEROUS GUY

05:24.959 --> 05:26.583
THAT THEY DESPERATELY
WANT TO SLEEP WITH,

05:26.583 --> 05:28.375
BUT NEVER WILL IN REAL LIFE.

05:28.375 --> 05:31.291
SEXY WILL ALWAYS
WIN OUT OVER NICE.

05:31.291 --> 05:34.583
I'M JUST SAYING THAT
EVERYBODY CASTS TOM HANKS,
YOU KNOW?

05:34.583 --> 05:37.625
TRY AND MAKE
A LESS OBVIOUS CHOICE.

05:37.625 --> 05:38.625
HEY, MOVIE AUDITIONS TODAY.

05:40.125 --> 05:43.417
[♪♪♪]

05:48.417 --> 05:49.750
[CLEARS THROAT]

05:49.750 --> 05:52.041
HEY! WHAT'S THIS?

05:52.041 --> 05:55.208
THE RESULTS OF
PACEY WITTER'S HIV TEST.

05:55.208 --> 05:57.166
YOU GOT TESTED?

05:57.166 --> 05:58.500
YOU TOLD ME TO.

05:58.500 --> 05:59.583
BUT YOU ARGUED WITH ME.

05:59.583 --> 06:01.375
ANDIE, I ALWAYS ARGUE
WITH YOU.

06:01.375 --> 06:02.708
IT DOESN'T MEAN
I DON'T LISTEN.

06:04.625 --> 06:05.750
AND...?

06:05.750 --> 06:06.583
AND IT'S NEGATIVE,

06:06.583 --> 06:08.792
WHICH IS POSITIVE
IN MY BOOK.

06:08.792 --> 06:11.500
CONGRATULATIONS.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

06:11.500 --> 06:14.166
GETTING TESTED WAS...
VERY RESPONSIBLE OF YOU.

06:16.458 --> 06:19.750
JUST DON'T THINK THAT,
YOU KNOW, NOW THAT YOU
GOT TESTED THAT, UM...

06:19.750 --> 06:20.875
WE'RE GOING TO...

06:20.875 --> 06:23.458
YOU KNOW.

06:23.458 --> 06:25.208
WHAT?

06:25.208 --> 06:26.375
YOU KNOW.

06:26.375 --> 06:30.834
NO, ANDIE, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

06:30.834 --> 06:34.375
OK, UM...YOU KNOW,
WE HAVEN'T BEEN VERY...

06:34.375 --> 06:35.708
PHYSICAL...OR ANYTHING.

06:35.708 --> 06:39.500
AND, UM...I'M NOT OPPOSED
TO US BECOMING MORE...

06:39.500 --> 06:41.083
INTIMATE, BUT I
JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

06:41.083 --> 06:43.041
THAT EVERYTHING'S GOT ITS
PERFECT PLACE AND TIME, OK?

06:43.041 --> 06:44.375
I DIDN'T GET TESTED

06:44.375 --> 06:46.708
TO ENGAGE IN ANY
UNINHIBITED SCRUMPING
WITH YOU.

06:46.708 --> 06:48.417
I GOT TESTED FOR ME.

06:48.417 --> 06:49.875
I DON'T WANT TO JUMP
IN THE SACK WITH YOU.

06:49.875 --> 06:51.458
OH.

06:51.458 --> 06:53.458
WELL, WHY NOT EXACTLY?
I MEAN...

06:53.458 --> 06:55.208
DO YOU NOT FIND ME
ATTRACTIVE?

06:55.208 --> 06:57.667
OF COURSE I FIND YOU
ATTRACTIVE, ANDIE.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.458
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO?

06:59.458 --> 07:01.917
DO YOU WANT TO?

07:01.917 --> 07:04.375
I ASKED YOU.

07:04.375 --> 07:06.041
WELL, I'M ASKING YOU
BACK.

07:06.041 --> 07:10.500
YOU FIRST.

07:10.500 --> 07:14.417
I'D LIKE TO SCRUMP WITH
YOU ANY DAY OF THE WEEK,

07:14.417 --> 07:16.583
BUT...WE'VE GOT ALL
THE TIME IN THE WORLD.

07:16.583 --> 07:18.708
THERE'S NO NEED TO RUSH
INTO ANYTHING.

07:18.708 --> 07:22.708
I KNOW. I HEAR YOU,
AND I CONCUR.

07:22.708 --> 07:24.708
WELL...GOOD.

07:24.708 --> 07:27.250
BUT IF IT WERE THE RIGHT
TIME AND PLACE,

07:27.250 --> 07:28.166
YOU WOULD WANT TO, RIGHT?

07:28.166 --> 07:30.417
OH, HELL, YES.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.625
OK. GOOD. TILL THEN.

07:35.583 --> 07:36.542
UNTIL.

07:40.959 --> 07:42.625
HEY.
HEY.

07:42.625 --> 07:43.083
MOVIE AUDITIONS.

07:43.083 --> 07:45.000
ART CLASS.

07:46.583 --> 07:49.458
I SEE YOU GRADUATED
FROM FRUIT BOWLS.

07:49.458 --> 07:52.458
WE'RE DOING LIFE
SKETCHING. NUDE MODELS.

07:52.458 --> 07:55.834
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SEE
THE HUMAN FORM AS A MASS
OF LINES AND SHADOWS.

07:55.834 --> 07:58.041
REALLY?

07:58.041 --> 07:59.583
I'M WORKING ON IT.

07:59.583 --> 08:01.166
AND HE JUST POSES FOR YOU?

08:01.166 --> 08:02.000
YEAH.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.375
DO YOU FIND THAT
UNCOMFORTABLE?

08:03.375 --> 08:05.291
JUST SITTING IN A ROOM
WITH SOME GUY COMPLETELY
IN THE BUFF

08:05.291 --> 08:07.125
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU?

08:07.125 --> 08:08.708
NO.

08:08.708 --> 08:09.708
DOES HE LIKE...

08:09.708 --> 08:11.625
TALK OR ANYTHING?

08:11.625 --> 08:13.125
OH, YEAH. HE SINGS,
TELLS JOKES,

08:13.125 --> 08:14.125
DOES A LITTLE SOFT SHOE.

08:14.125 --> 08:16.000
NO, HE DOESN'T TALK,
DAWSON.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.291
HE'S A MODEL.
HE SITS THERE.

08:17.291 --> 08:19.750
HE JUST TAKES BREAKS
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

08:19.750 --> 08:22.708
AND LITTLE JOEY POTTER
DOESN'T BLUSH?

08:22.708 --> 08:24.708
NO.

08:24.708 --> 08:27.792
NOT EVEN A LITTLE?

08:27.792 --> 08:28.291
MAYBE A LITTLE.

08:28.291 --> 08:29.667
JUST A LITTLE?

08:32.250 --> 08:33.582
OK, I'VE
BROKEN 12 PENCILS,

08:33.582 --> 08:35.750
BUT IT'S GETTING BETTER.

08:35.750 --> 08:36.667
YOU'D BE SURPRISED,
DAWSON. I'M CHANGING.

08:36.667 --> 08:39.750
I'M NOT LITTLE
JOEY POTTER ANYMORE.

08:39.750 --> 08:42.125
NO, YOU'RE CERTAINLY NOT.

08:46.667 --> 08:47.166
Jen: AUDITIONS.

08:47.166 --> 08:50.166
COME, PLEASE.

08:50.166 --> 08:53.166
JEN'S YOUR PRODUCER.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.041
Jen: AUDITIONS TODAY.

08:54.041 --> 08:56.750
YEAH, YEAH.
I MEAN, YOU'RE BUSY.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.000
SO WHAT'S YOUR MOVIE
ABOUT?

09:02.000 --> 09:05.708
UM...

09:05.708 --> 09:08.333
A YOUNG BOY COMES OF AGE
IN A--IN A SMALL TOWN.

09:08.333 --> 09:11.041
WELL, GOOD LUCK WITH IT,
DAWSON.

09:11.041 --> 09:12.083
THANK YOU. YEAH, GOTTA GO.

09:12.083 --> 09:13.375
TIME IS MONEY.

09:13.375 --> 09:16.458
[♪♪♪]

09:17.667 --> 09:21.208
HEY, YOU GONNA AUDITION
FOR DAWSON'S MOVIE?

09:21.208 --> 09:24.291
PARTICIPATE
IN DAWSON LEERY'S
LAME HOME VIDEO PROJECT?

09:24.291 --> 09:25.458
DOUBTFUL. WHY, ARE YOU?

09:25.458 --> 09:27.750
I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT.

09:27.750 --> 09:29.875
I GOT THE AUDITION PIECE.
I WAS LOOKING THROUGH IT.

09:29.875 --> 09:32.750
AND HE'S GOT FINANCING.
HE'S GONNA DO THE FESTIVAL
CIRCUIT.

09:32.750 --> 09:35.166
IT COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR SOME HOLLYWOOD-TYPE
EXPOSURE.

09:35.166 --> 09:39.417
YEAH, RIGHT. ARE YOU
HAVING DELUSIONS
OF BRAD PITTITIS?

09:39.417 --> 09:41.250
I THINK I'D MAKE A PRETTY
GOOD ACTOR ACTUALLY.

09:41.250 --> 09:45.291
AND ACTORS GET ACTION.
I MEAN, I FORESEE
A NON-STOP PARTY.

09:45.291 --> 09:47.250
I WAS THINKING MAYBE YOU
AND I COULD READ TOGETHER.

09:47.250 --> 09:48.333
YOU AND ME?

09:48.333 --> 09:49.333
YEAH, COME ON.

09:49.333 --> 09:51.708
I THINK WE'D HAVE SOME
SERIOUS CHEMISTRY.

09:51.708 --> 09:53.959
COME ON,
AUDITION WITH ME.

09:53.959 --> 09:55.000
SALIVATE ELSEWHERE.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.250
I COULDN'T BE LESS
INTERESTED.

10:02.625 --> 10:04.542
WOW!

10:04.542 --> 10:06.083
DON'T LOOK.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.417
I'VE SEEN A NAKED GUY
BEFORE, JOEY.

10:07.417 --> 10:10.250
YEAH, BUT NOT DRAWN
WITH THE TALENT
OF A SECOND GRADER.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.875
TRUST ME. I'M DOING
YOUR EYES A FAVOR.

10:11.875 --> 10:13.750
COME ON. LET ME SEE.
LET ME SEE.

10:13.750 --> 10:16.667
WOW! IT'S GOOD USE
OF LIGHT AND DARK,

10:16.667 --> 10:18.291
ESPECIALLY AROUND THE SIDE.

10:18.291 --> 10:19.500
I MEAN, IT'S VERY DRAMATIC.

10:19.500 --> 10:20.166
SHADING'S EXCELLENT.

10:20.166 --> 10:22.375
REALLY?

10:22.375 --> 10:23.333
YEAH.

10:23.333 --> 10:24.708
THE LINES ARE STRONG.

10:24.708 --> 10:27.792
UH, EVERYTHING SEEMS TO...
BE IN PROPORTION.

10:27.792 --> 10:31.125
UH...THE REALNESS--

10:31.125 --> 10:32.333
OH! GOD, JOEY!

10:32.333 --> 10:36.667
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

10:36.667 --> 10:38.125
Joey:
I GOTTA GO.

10:38.125 --> 10:41.625
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE SAYING THIS
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS

10:41.625 --> 10:44.458
OF HIDING BEHIND HIGHBROW
ANALYTICAL POSSUMING--

10:44.458 --> 10:46.291
Boy: I LOVE YOU.

10:46.291 --> 10:48.000
I KNOW IT'S NONSENSICAL.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.583
NONSENSICAL? IT'S INSANE!

10:49.583 --> 10:51.208
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR 15 YEARS.

10:51.208 --> 10:53.375
SOMEWHERE IN THERE YOU
COULDN'T FIND THE TIME
TO FREUDIAN SLIP--

10:53.375 --> 10:57.375
SO MANY TIMES, BUT YOU
DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
I'VE WRESTLED INTERNALLY

10:57.375 --> 11:01.500
WITH THE PSYCHOLOGICAL
REPERCUSSIONS
OF MY FEELINGS--

11:01.500 --> 11:05.625
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING
INTERNALLY

11:05.625 --> 11:07.792
WITH MY PSYCHOLOGICAL
REPRODUCTIONS--

11:07.792 --> 11:09.542
BUT MY HEART SAYS
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

11:09.542 --> 11:13.375
THAT I SHOULD CONSIDER
THE UNEQUIVOCAL,
POSSIBLY DAMAGING,

11:13.375 --> 11:18.083
HIGHLY IRRATIONAL,
HYPNOTICALLY SCARRING
PROPOSITION OF...

11:18.083 --> 11:20.542
OF LOVING YOU BACK.

11:20.542 --> 11:22.875
COOL.

11:26.166 --> 11:28.291
[♪♪♪]

11:36.166 --> 11:36.834
LISTEN, I'M SORRY.

11:36.834 --> 11:39.750
UH...CAN YOU SAVE IT?

11:42.000 --> 11:42.959
OH, GOD.

11:42.959 --> 11:45.625
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
I-I'M SORRY. I MEAN...

11:45.625 --> 11:47.083
CAN I DO ANYTHING? WHAT?

11:47.083 --> 11:49.500
THERE'S NOTHING YOU
CAN DO, JACK. IT'S DUE THURSDAY.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.208
I'M ALREADY
THE YOUNGEST AND LEAST-
EXPERIENCED IN THE CLASS,

11:51.208 --> 11:53.417
AND NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW UP
WITH AN INCOMPLETE ASSIGNMENT.

11:53.417 --> 11:55.750
CAN YOU REDRAW IT?

11:55.750 --> 11:57.959
NOT FROM MEMORY. I MEAN,
THIS IS A NUDE MAN, JACK.

11:57.959 --> 12:02.208
I CAN'T JUST RECALL IT
FROM THIN AIR.

12:02.208 --> 12:03.250
THE--THE POSE,

12:03.250 --> 12:06.417
THE COMPOSITION,
THE LIGHT, THE SHADOWS...

12:06.417 --> 12:08.583
I JUST CAN'T RECREATE THAT.

12:08.583 --> 12:11.291
UM...

12:11.291 --> 12:13.250
LET ME POSE FOR YOU.

12:13.250 --> 12:13.875
WHAT?

12:13.875 --> 12:15.375
YEAH. NO, I'M SERIOUS.

12:15.375 --> 12:16.792
LET ME POSE FOR YOU.
NO BIG DEAL.

12:16.792 --> 12:19.083
YOU WANT TO POSE FOR ME
NAKED?

12:19.083 --> 12:21.708
UH-HUH. YEAH.

12:21.708 --> 12:23.375
UH, LET ME
THINK ABOUT THAT.

12:23.375 --> 12:24.959
NO.

12:24.959 --> 12:26.875
Jack: WELL...

12:26.875 --> 12:29.792
OK, UH, UH, OK,
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU
DON'T TURN IT IN?

12:29.792 --> 12:32.917
I GET AN "F," NOT
TO MENTION EMBARRASSMENT

12:32.917 --> 12:34.917
AND FEELINGS
OF TREMENDOUS INADEQUACY.

12:34.917 --> 12:36.417
THAT'S IT.
I'M POSING FOR YOU.

12:36.417 --> 12:38.000
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.750
FREAKED ABOUT
SEEING ME NAKED?

12:39.750 --> 12:42.917
AH, THE "JOEY'S A PRUDE"
TACTIC. CLEVER, BUT WRONG.

12:42.917 --> 12:44.166
ALL RIGHT. WELL THEN,
WHAT IS IT?

12:44.166 --> 12:46.375
I MEAN, YOU SCARED
IT MIGHT GET SEXUAL
OR SOMETHING?

12:46.375 --> 12:49.792
YOU KNOW, BELIEVE IT
OR NOT, JACK,

12:49.792 --> 12:51.250
NOT EVERY MOMENT WITH YOU
IS SEXUALLY CHARGED.

12:51.250 --> 12:52.917
SORRY.

12:52.917 --> 12:55.417
WELL, THEN THERE
SHOULD BE NO PROBLEM.

12:55.417 --> 12:56.875
COME ON, LOOK,
I FEEL AWFUL ABOUT THIS.

12:56.875 --> 12:59.291
I DON'T WANT YOU FAILING
YOUR FIRST ART PROJECT
BECAUSE OF ME,

12:59.291 --> 13:00.458
SO LET ME HELP YOU.

13:00.458 --> 13:01.875
YOU'RE SERIOUS,
AREN'T YOU?

13:01.875 --> 13:03.125
I'M DEAD SERIOUS.

13:03.125 --> 13:04.917
I HAVE HUGE GUILT
ABOUT THINGS LIKE THIS.

13:04.917 --> 13:07.417
SO DON'T FEEL WEIRD
'CAUSE I DON'T.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.166
I DON'T KNOW, JACK.

13:10.166 --> 13:11.583
I DON'T THINK THIS
IS A GOOD THING FOR US.
I MEAN WE SHOULD--

13:11.583 --> 13:14.041
STRICTLY
PROFESSIONAL, OK?

13:14.041 --> 13:16.166
I MEAN, COME ON, JOEY,
THIS IS YOUR ART.

13:17.583 --> 13:19.041
WELL...

13:19.041 --> 13:21.542
I GUESS THE MALE FORM
IS JUST THE MALE FORM.

13:21.542 --> 13:22.625
GOOD. IT'S SETTLED.

13:22.625 --> 13:24.708
I'LL BE BY YOUR HOUSE
TOMORROW AROUND 7:00.

13:27.291 --> 13:28.458

CAREFUL OF THE DOSAGE.
I PUT A PAMPHLET IN THERE
FOR YOU.

13:55.375 --> 13:58.166
I'M FAMILIAR WITH
THE DRUG, THANK YOU.

13:58.166 --> 13:59.583
HEY, THERE, McPHEE.

UH, "ANDREA McPHEE.
TAKE 2 TABLETS DAILY
AS DIRECTED.

14:11.166 --> 14:13.000

14:13.000 --> 14:15.375
ZANAX. THAT'S, UH...

14:15.375 --> 14:17.834
THAT'S FOR SEVERE
DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY,
RIGHT?

14:17.834 --> 14:19.834
IT'S LIKE PROZAC, SO...

14:19.834 --> 14:23.458
UH, IT'S MY MOM'S.
WE HAVE THE SAME
FIRST NAME--ANDREA.

14:23.458 --> 14:26.125

ABOUT HER.

14:26.125 --> 14:27.375
YEAH, YEAH,

14:37.500 --> 14:39.542
I WAS JUST PICKING UP
SOME STUFF.

14:39.542 --> 14:44.208

CONDOM SECTION?

14:44.208 --> 14:46.458
[STUMBLING]

14:46.458 --> 14:47.959
I HAD NO IDEA.

14:47.959 --> 14:49.625
IT'S VERY ODD,
DON'T YOU THINK?

14:49.625 --> 14:52.458
YOU DON'T THINK THIS
IS A SIGN, LIKE THE LOVE
GODS ARE TRYIN' TO...

14:52.458 --> 14:54.375
HELP US OUT OR--

14:54.375 --> 14:56.542
NO, I THINK
THAT WOULD BE YOU.

14:56.542 --> 14:58.458
I'M JUST ENGAGING
IN A LITTLE INNUENDO

14:58.458 --> 14:59.458
IN THE HOPES
THAT MAYBE SOMEDAY

14:59.458 --> 15:01.542
IT'LL LEAD TO SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE...

15:01.542 --> 15:02.625
TANGIBLE.

15:02.625 --> 15:06.875

I'M ENTIRELY PREPARED YET.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.750

EXTRA PLEASURE."

15:22.542 --> 15:25.125
YEAH, HOW WOULD THEY KNOW?

15:25.125 --> 15:26.667
MAYBE THEY'RE DESIGNED
BY WOMEN.

15:26.667 --> 15:32.291
OH. GOOD POINT.

15:32.291 --> 15:34.083
SO, UH...
SHOULD WE GET SOME?

15:44.625 --> 15:46.750
ARE YOU BEING SERIOUS?

15:46.750 --> 15:49.417
IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA
TO HAVE THEM ON STAND-BY.

15:49.417 --> 15:51.917
I MEAN, WE CAN BE ADULTS
ABOUT THIS.

15:51.917 --> 15:52.667
UH...

15:52.667 --> 15:54.750
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.250

ELSE I CAN READ WITH?

15:56.250 --> 15:57.708

WE'RE SHORT ON TIME.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.625
IF YOU COULD JUST START
AT PAGE 3, THAT'D BE GREAT.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.834

BUT CAN I JUST ASK
A QUICK QUESTION?

16:01.834 --> 16:02.625
WHAT IS IT, CHRIS?

16:02.625 --> 16:04.083
I JUST...

16:04.083 --> 16:06.959

THEY DON'T EVER DO IT.

16:06.959 --> 16:09.542
I MEAN, YOU HAVE ALL
THE HOT FOREPLAY STUFF,

16:09.542 --> 16:10.959
BUT THEY NEVER HOOK UP.

16:10.959 --> 16:12.333
RIGHT.

16:12.333 --> 16:15.792
WELL, SEE, YOUR CHARACTER
BELIEVES THAT SOMETIMES
TRUE LOVE

16:15.792 --> 16:17.959
GOES BEYOND THAT WHICH
IS MERELY PHYSICAL.

16:17.959 --> 16:19.041
Chris: YEAH.

16:19.041 --> 16:20.792
YOU SEE, THAT'S JUST
THE PART I DON'T GET.

16:20.792 --> 16:23.458
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
DAWSON, I THINK YOU
SHOULD RETHINK THAT PART.

16:23.458 --> 16:24.625
IT'S A LITTLE HEADY.

16:24.625 --> 16:25.834
OK, UH, YOU KNOW,
YOU GUYS,

16:25.834 --> 16:28.875
WHY DON'T WE JUST
KEEP MOVING WITH
THE SCENE, OK?

16:32.583 --> 16:35.834
I'VE WANTED TO...

16:35.834 --> 16:37.333
SO MANY TIMES.

16:37.333 --> 16:39.291
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
I'VE WRESTLED INTERNALLY

16:39.291 --> 16:42.333

REPERCUSSIONS
OF MY FEELINGS.

16:42.333 --> 16:45.208

TO PROCESS HERE.

16:45.208 --> 16:47.250
MY ELECTRICAL SYNAPSES
ARE ON OVERLOAD.

16:47.250 --> 16:50.208
MY BRAIN SAYS ONE THING,
BUT MY HEART
SAYS SOMETHING ELSE.

16:50.208 --> 16:52.083
THAT I SHOULD CONSIDER
THE UNEQUIVOCAL,

16:52.083 --> 16:54.583
POSSIBLY DAMAGING,
HIGHLY IRRATIONAL,

16:54.583 --> 16:56.667
HYPNOTICALLY SCARRING,
PROPOSITION OF...

16:56.667 --> 16:58.625
OF LOVING YOU BACK.

16:58.625 --> 16:59.834
WAIT.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.625
UNH...

17:02.625 --> 17:04.791
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT,
YOU LUG-NECKED FREAK?

17:04.791 --> 17:06.208
A KISS.

17:06.208 --> 17:07.290
IT'S IN THE SCRIPT.

17:07.290 --> 17:09.125
THAT WAS YOUR TONGUE
IN MY MOUTH.

17:09.125 --> 17:12.165
SORRY, I WAS JUST
GETTING INTO THE ROLE.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.333
NO, YOU WERE TRYING
TO GET INTO MY PANTS.

17:14.333 --> 17:15.916
GOD, I'M GOING TO BE SICK.

17:19.791 --> 17:22.250
SHALL I CONTINUE?

17:22.250 --> 17:25.916
THAT'LL BE ALL.
THANK YOU.

17:25.916 --> 17:27.666
I'VE PUT LOTS OF FANTASY
THOUGHT INTO THIS,

17:27.666 --> 17:30.875
AND I WANT MY FIRST TIME
TO BE SPECIAL.

17:30.875 --> 17:32.208
YOU KNOW,
THE PERFECT EVENING.

17:32.208 --> 17:35.125
LIKE, DINNER AT A FRENCH
RESTAURANT,

17:35.125 --> 17:39.041
A ROMANTIC AFTER-DINNER
STROLL BY THE DOCK,

17:39.041 --> 17:41.875
AND THEN ONTO A NICE
HISTORIC BED AND BREAKFAST.

17:41.875 --> 17:44.083
A BED AND BREAKFAST?

17:44.083 --> 17:46.375
IT'S MY FANTASY,
GO WITH IT.

17:46.375 --> 17:48.625
LAVENDER CANDLES...AND, UH,

17:48.625 --> 17:52.125
SINATRA, OR SOMEBODY EQUALLY
AS OLD-STYLE AND ROMANTIC.

17:52.125 --> 17:55.375
OK. SCHEDULE
IN BATHROOM BREAKS,

17:55.375 --> 17:57.375
OR DOES THE POOR GUY
HAVE TO HOLD IT
ALL EVENING?

17:57.375 --> 18:00.875
OK, I'M SORRY, BUT DECIDING
TO LOSE MY VIRGINITY

18:00.875 --> 18:03.125
IS A HUGE DEAL, OK?

18:03.125 --> 18:06.333
I MEAN, I DIDN'T HOLD
ONTO IT FOR 16 YEARS

18:06.333 --> 18:08.625
JUST TO LOSE IT IN ONE
DRUNK FLEETING MOMENT

18:08.625 --> 18:11.667
IN SOME SKANKY BACK SEAT
OF A LATE MODEL AMERICAN
CAR, OK?

18:11.667 --> 18:13.417
DAMN!

18:13.417 --> 18:16.208
SOMEBODY'S
LEAKING ALL MY BEST
LOVEMAKING SECRETS.

18:18.041 --> 18:20.250
IT'S JUST THAT...

18:20.250 --> 18:23.375
I'M GOING TO REMEMBER THIS
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

18:23.375 --> 18:26.208
AND I JUST THINK THAT
IF WE PUT A LITTLE PLANNING
INTO IT,

18:26.208 --> 18:28.041
TO ENSURE THAT
IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING,

18:28.041 --> 18:29.333
IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE.

18:29.333 --> 18:34.000
I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
THE FIRST TIME IS.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.708
BELIEVE ME,
OF ALL PEOPLE, I KNOW.

18:36.708 --> 18:38.291
AND I KNOW
WITH MY TAINTED PAST,

18:38.291 --> 18:42.000
I MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST
LIKELY OF CANDIDATES,

18:42.000 --> 18:45.208
BUT IF AND WHEN
YOU DO DECIDE IT'S
THE RIGHT TIME FOR YOU,

18:45.208 --> 18:47.125
I'D REALLY
LIKE TO BE THE ONE

18:47.125 --> 18:49.125
THAT HELPS TO MAKE IT
A MEMORABLE EVENING.

18:51.792 --> 18:54.792
WELL, WHEN YOU
TALK LIKE THAT,

18:54.792 --> 18:57.291
IT MAKES ME
WANT TO JUMP YOU.

18:57.291 --> 18:58.708
OH, REALLY?

18:58.708 --> 18:59.792
YES.

IT'S JUST SO FRUSTRATING

19:18.834 --> 19:20.500
TO HAVE THIS DREAM
OF MAKING THIS MOVIE,

19:20.500 --> 19:21.667
TO ACTUALLY GET THE MONEY
TO MAKE THE MOVIE,

19:21.667 --> 19:25.875
AND THEN REALIZING THAT
IT STILL MIGHT NOT HAPPEN.

19:25.875 --> 19:27.834
JUST LIKE IN THE SCRIPT.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.792
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:30.792 --> 19:32.333
I MEAN, YOU AND JOEY.

19:32.333 --> 19:36.417
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HER
FOR 15 YEARS,

19:36.417 --> 19:39.333
AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE
JUST ABOUT TO HAVE HER,

19:39.333 --> 19:41.792
YOU LOSE HER. TRAGIC.

19:41.792 --> 19:45.375
THE SCRIPT
IS NOT ABOUT JOEY.

IT READS LIKE
AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY.

19:48.166 --> 19:51.500

I THOUGHT THAT...

19:51.500 --> 19:53.291
WE HAD SOMETHING, TOO,
BUT...

19:53.291 --> 19:55.625
EVEN WITH MY FLAIR
FOR THE DRAMATIC,

19:55.625 --> 19:57.458

YOU SOMETHING, DAWSON--

WELL, WE JUST ATE
AT PETITE LA BISTRO,

32:48.875 --> 32:50.917
THEN WE WENT FOR A STROLL
ALONG THE DOCKS...

32:50.917 --> 32:53.959
BLINDFOLDED,
I MIGHT ADD.

32:53.959 --> 32:55.375
SO THINK ABOUT IT.

32:55.375 --> 32:57.250
THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE
WE COULD BE RIGHT NOW,
ISN'T THERE?

33:00.125 --> 33:03.959
PACEY, IF I TAKE OFF THIS
BLINDFOLD AND WE'RE STANDING
IN A BED AND BREAKFAST,

33:03.959 --> 33:05.959
YOU'RE DEAD.

33:05.959 --> 33:11.417
WELL...DISPOSE
OF MY REMAINS NOW.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.458
OH, OH, OH, PACEY.

33:16.458 --> 33:20.291
GOD, I DON'T KNOW
WHETHER TO BE TOUCHED

33:20.291 --> 33:22.500
OR TERRIFIED.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.083
HEY, LISTEN,

33:25.083 --> 33:29.667
YOU KNOW, THIS NIGHT WAS NOT
DESIGNED TO REACH THE VERDICT
OF DOING IT.

33:29.667 --> 33:31.291
I JUST--I WANTED TO GIVE YOU
YOUR FANTASY EVENING.

33:31.291 --> 33:35.667
YOU KNOW, A FRENCH DINNER,
A STROLL ALONG THE DOCKS,
A BED AND BREAKFAST,

33:35.667 --> 33:37.834
ROMANTIC MUSIC.

33:37.834 --> 33:41.125
WE CAN SAVE DOING IT
FOR ANOTHER TIME.

33:41.125 --> 33:43.500
THIS IS
A STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS.

33:43.500 --> 33:46.667
FOR ME, TOO.

33:46.667 --> 33:48.834
OH, PACEY.

33:48.834 --> 33:51.667
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

33:51.667 --> 33:56.708
I...I REALLY WANT
TO DO THIS. I MEAN...

33:56.708 --> 34:00.333
I'D BE LYING
IF I SAID I DIDN'T.

34:00.333 --> 34:05.250
AND...YOU'RE REALLY
SPECIAL TO ME.

34:05.250 --> 34:08.083
BUT, UH, I...

34:08.083 --> 34:10.417
I DON'T--I DON'T THINK
I'M READY FOR THIS
RIGHT NOW.

34:10.417 --> 34:13.041
I MEAN, THERE'S SO MUCH
THAT'S GOING ON THAT
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT,

34:13.041 --> 34:15.208
AND THAT I CAN'T EVEN
BEGIN TO TELL YOU,
UM, I--I...

34:15.208 --> 34:17.792
I CAN'T DO THIS.
I-I'M SORRY, PACEY.

34:17.792 --> 34:18.750
IT'S OK.

34:18.750 --> 34:19.750
I CAN'T DO THIS.

34:19.750 --> 34:21.708
WHY? DON'T WORRY.

34:21.708 --> 34:24.458
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
I TOLD YOU.

34:24.458 --> 34:27.750
WE CAN WAIT. HONESTLY...

34:27.750 --> 34:31.333
I THINK I BROUGHT YOU HERE
TONIGHT AS MUCH FOR ME
AS I DID FOR YOU.

34:31.333 --> 34:36.583
I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU
YOUR FANTASY EVENING,
YOU KNOW, SO...

34:36.583 --> 34:38.208
PLEASE DON'T BE UPSET
WITH ME.

34:38.208 --> 34:40.375
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR ME,

34:40.375 --> 34:41.375
JUST BEING IN MY LIFE.

34:41.375 --> 34:42.958
I MEAN, YOU MAKE ME FEEL

34:42.958 --> 34:46.041
LIKE MAYBE THERE'S HOPE

34:46.041 --> 34:48.750
FOR MY PATHETIC EXISTENCE,

34:48.750 --> 34:52.250
AND I DON'T HAVE TO SLEEP
WITH YOU TO FEEL THAT.

34:52.250 --> 34:55.083
I FEEL IT RIGHT NOW,

34:55.083 --> 34:55.833
JUST HOLDING YOU IN MY ARMS.

34:55.833 --> 35:00.750
GOD, I AM SO LUCKY.

35:02.083 --> 35:04.375
YOU KNOW WHAT, WITTER?

35:04.375 --> 35:06.208
YOU MAKE ME
WANT TO DO IT.

35:16.875 --> 35:19.000
[♪♪♪]

36:16.250 --> 36:18.667
LISTEN, I'M REALLY SORRY.

36:18.667 --> 36:20.834
LISTEN, JACK,
IT'S OK, YOU KNOW,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

36:20.834 --> 36:22.291
STUFF HAPPENS.

36:22.291 --> 36:24.375
ALTHOUGH NOT USUALLY
THAT KIND OF STUFF

36:24.375 --> 36:27.000
AND USUALLY NOT IN THE
POTTER LIVING ROOM.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.750
I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD
BE SUCH A BIG DEAL FOR ME
TO POSE FOR YOU.

36:28.750 --> 36:32.041
YEAH, WELL...

36:32.041 --> 36:34.208
LISTEN, UM...

36:34.208 --> 36:36.583
IS THIS GONNA
SCREW THINGS UP WITH US?

36:36.583 --> 36:40.083
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

36:40.083 --> 36:42.834
WELL, I MEAN, I DIDN'T
WANT TO BRING SEX IN THIS
EVENING, YOU KNOW.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.333
ALL I WANTED TO DO
WAS HELP YOU.

36:44.333 --> 36:47.000
UH, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO THINK 'CAUSE A...

36:47.000 --> 36:50.250
ALL THIS STUFF...

36:50.250 --> 36:53.166
HERE WE GO AGAIN.
SOCIAL FLAW.

36:53.166 --> 36:54.667
WELL, LET'S BE HONEST
WITH OURSELVES.

36:54.667 --> 36:57.792
YES, WE BOTH CAME
IN HERE WITH THE NOBLEST
OF INTENTIONS.

36:57.792 --> 37:01.500
BUT, YOU KNOW,
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
WE'RE BOTH HUMAN,

37:01.500 --> 37:04.083
AND...THERE'S SOMETHING
BETWEEN US THAT'S...

37:04.083 --> 37:08.500
YOU KNOW, IT'S A...

37:08.500 --> 37:11.083
UH...

37:11.083 --> 37:12.875
IS YOUR SOCIAL FLAW
CONTAGIOUS?

37:12.875 --> 37:14.917
UH, YEAH...

37:14.917 --> 37:17.083
GOD, I WAS SO NAIVE
TO THINK THAT THIS WAS
A GOOD IDEA.

37:17.083 --> 37:18.917
NO, I TAKE
FULL RESPONSIBILITY

37:18.917 --> 37:19.959
FOR THIS EVENING'S
TURN OF EVENTS.

37:19.959 --> 37:23.750
I MEAN, IT'S MY FAULT.
I ASKED TO HEAR IT.

37:23.750 --> 37:24.875
THAT'S TRUE.

37:24.875 --> 37:27.792
ACTUALLY, I THINK--
I THINK IT WAS YOUR FAULT.

37:32.375 --> 37:37.792
IT'S...IT'S
JUST THAT, UH...
I DON'T KNOW.

37:37.792 --> 37:41.542
TONIGHT WAS A BIG STEP
IN THE LIFE OF LITTLE
JOEY POTTER.

37:41.542 --> 37:44.250
SHE DIDN'T FEEL
SO LITTLE TONIGHT.

37:44.250 --> 37:49.583
I GUESS I JUST TRIED
TO BITE OFF A TAD
TOO MUCH.

37:49.583 --> 37:53.041
WELL, YOU WERE CURIOUS.

37:53.041 --> 37:55.333
YEAH.

37:55.333 --> 37:58.542
FOR ALL THE BIG WORDS
AND NOT WANTING TO HEAR
THE GORY DETAILS,

37:58.542 --> 38:01.417
I GUESS
I'M JUST WRESTLING
WITH MY HORMONES

38:01.417 --> 38:04.166
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

38:06.083 --> 38:09.291
WELL, UM, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU EVER WANT TO, UH,

38:09.291 --> 38:12.834
EXPLORE YOUR CURIOSITY...

38:12.834 --> 38:14.708
I'M AVAILABLE.

38:16.959 --> 38:18.875
FIRST YOU'RE A MODEL,
NOW YOU'RE A TOUR GUIDE.

38:18.875 --> 38:21.417
NO.

38:21.417 --> 38:25.291
I'M JUST A GUY WHO...

38:25.291 --> 38:26.542
FINDS IT REALLY HARD
NOT TO WANT TO HOLD YOU.

38:27.959 --> 38:31.458
AND TOUCH YOU.

38:31.458 --> 38:34.250
AND I DIDN'T REALLY REALIZE
THAT UNTIL TONIGHT

38:34.250 --> 38:38.208
WHEN IT WAS COMPLETELY
FORBIDDEN.

38:41.333 --> 38:44.417
YOU HAVE
YOUR CLOTHES ON NOW.

38:45.667 --> 38:48.375
YOU'RE SAYING
IT'S NOT FORBIDDEN?

38:48.375 --> 38:52.667
NO. I'M JUST SAYING
IT'S, UM...

38:52.667 --> 38:55.625
IT'S NOT AS SCARY.

38:55.625 --> 38:57.000
GEE, THANKS.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.041
NO, UH...

38:59.041 --> 39:02.500
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

39:02.500 --> 39:07.375
I THINK THAT, UH,
2 SCARED PEOPLE...

39:07.375 --> 39:10.041
CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT.

39:10.041 --> 39:13.250
MEANING?

39:13.250 --> 39:17.542
MEANING THAT TONIGHT
WAS A NIGHT OF FIRSTS,

39:17.542 --> 39:21.166
AND THERE'S NO REASON
THAT IT HAS TO STOP.

39:26.750 --> 39:29.542
[♪♪♪]

39:49.875 --> 39:51.542
[RUSTLING]

39:51.542 --> 39:54.375
DAWSON?

39:54.375 --> 39:58.250
DAWSON, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

40:01.333 --> 40:03.375
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT

40:03.375 --> 40:05.291
MOTIVE AND INTENT.

40:05.291 --> 40:08.792
AND LOVE VS. HURT VS.
LUST VS. DISTRACTION.

40:08.792 --> 40:10.917
AND?

40:20.250 --> 40:25.083
DON'T ASK MY MOTIVE.

40:25.083 --> 40:26.625
I KNOW BETTER.

40:33.625 --> 40:34.125
UM...

40:34.125 --> 40:35.583
WHAT'S WRONG?

40:35.583 --> 40:39.708
UH...YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BELIEVE THIS--

40:39.708 --> 40:43.250
FRANKLY, I DON'T
REALLY BELIEVE IT, BUT...

40:43.250 --> 40:47.667
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

40:47.667 --> 40:50.458
YEAH, I SAID THAT OUT LOUD,
RIGHT?

40:50.458 --> 40:51.834
YOU DON'T WANT TO?

40:51.834 --> 40:57.083
UH, NO, NO, I DO.
GOD, DO I, BUT...

40:57.083 --> 40:58.417
SO?

40:58.417 --> 41:01.625
SO, FOR ONCE, PACEY WITTER'S
RAGING HORMONES

41:01.625 --> 41:04.125
AREN'T GOING TO DO
ALL THE TALKING.

41:04.125 --> 41:08.375
AND FOR ONCE, I'M GONNA
DO THE RIGHT THING AND...

41:08.375 --> 41:10.625
WE'RE NOT READY
FOR THIS, ANDIE.

41:10.625 --> 41:12.959
B-BUT I MIGHT BE READY
AND--

41:12.959 --> 41:16.792
AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING
LIKE A REALLY CHEESY
AFTER SCHOOL SPECIAL,

41:16.792 --> 41:19.458
WHEN YOU'RE REALLY READY,
YOU'LL KNOW,

41:19.458 --> 41:22.166
AND THEN WE'LL DO THIS.

41:22.166 --> 41:23.917
THEN WE'LL DO THIS
TILL THE COWS COME HOME.

41:23.917 --> 41:26.417
BUT THIS THING
IS WAY TOO IMPORTANT

41:26.417 --> 41:28.375
FOR ME TO JUST FALL BACK ON
THE OLD "DO NOW, THINK LATER"

41:28.375 --> 41:29.708
PACEY WITTER APPROACH.

41:29.708 --> 41:34.792
YOU KNOW WHAT THE REALLY
RISKY THING FOR ME TO DO IS?

41:34.792 --> 41:37.208
IT'S TO NOT HAVE SEX.

41:37.208 --> 41:41.083
I MEAN, MAYBE THAT WAY
I'LL HAVE SOME SEMBLANCE
OF A REAL RELATIONSHIP.

41:41.083 --> 41:41.708
SO...

41:47.166 --> 41:50.125
YOU TAKE ALL
THE TIME YOU NEED,

41:50.125 --> 41:51.750
'CAUSE I'LL BE HERE.

THERE YOU GO AGAIN,
PACEY.

41:59.208 --> 42:00.667

TO DO IT EVEN MORE.

42:00.667 --> 42:03.500

OF MY EVIL PLAN.

42:03.500 --> 42:04.792
