Big Fish - YIFY

00:55.630 --> 00:58.760
There are some fish
that cannot be caught.

01:00.640 --> 01:03.680
It's not that they're faster
or stronger than other fish.

01:04.140 --> 01:07.270
They're just touched
by something extra.

01:08.650 --> 01:11.320
One such fish was The Beast.

01:12.650 --> 01:16.660
And by the time I was born
he was already a legend.

01:17.160 --> 01:21.620
He'd passed up more $ 100 lures
than any fish in Alabama.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.580
Some said that fish was
the ghost of a thief...

01:26.170 --> 01:29.000
...who'd drowned in that river
60 years before.

01:30.670 --> 01:35.380
Others claimed he was a dinosaur
left over from the "Cruaceous" Period.

01:35.670 --> 01:39.510
I didn't put any stock into
such speculation or superstition.

01:39.680 --> 01:42.430
All I knew was I'd been trying
to catch that fish...

01:42.680 --> 01:45.270
...since I was a boy
no bigger than you.

01:45.680 --> 01:48.190
And on the day you were born...

01:48.190 --> 01:51.150
Well, that was the day
I finally caught him.

01:53.690 --> 01:54.690
Now, I'd tried everything on it:

01:55.190 --> 01:58.820
Worms, lures, peanut butter,
peanut butter and cheese.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.660
But on that day I had a revelation:

02:01.700 --> 02:06.540
If that fish was Henry Walls' ghost,
then the usual bait wasn't gonna work.

02:06.710 --> 02:11.340
I was gonna have to use something
he truly desired.

02:12.210 --> 02:14.710
- Your finger?
- Gold.

02:15.210 --> 02:18.380
Now, I tied my ring onto
the strongest line they made...

02:18.720 --> 02:23.560
...strong enough to hold up a bridge,
they said, if only for a few minutes.

02:24.220 --> 02:26.850
And then I cast upriver.

02:29.730 --> 02:34.360
The Beast jumped up and grabbed it
before it even hit the water.

02:34.730 --> 02:39.280
And just as fast,
he snapped clean through that line.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.780
Well, you can see my predicament.

02:41.240 --> 02:45.200
My wedding ring,
the symbol of fidelity to my wife...

02:45.240 --> 02:47.790
...soon to be mother of my child...
- Make him stop.

02:48.250 --> 02:50.670
...was now lost in the gut
of an uncatchable fish.

02:51.250 --> 02:52.580
What did you do?

02:53.250 --> 02:56.420
I followed that fish upriver
and downriver.

02:58.260 --> 03:00.550
This fish, The Beast...

03:00.760 --> 03:06.680
...the whole time we were calling it
a him, when in fact it was a her.

03:06.770 --> 03:09.180
It was fat with eggs
it was gonna lay any day.

03:09.270 --> 03:11.770
Now, I was in a situation.

03:12.270 --> 03:15.730
I could gut that fish
and get my wedding ring back...

03:16.280 --> 03:21.240
...but in doing so I'd be killing the
smartest catfish in the Ashton River.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.570
Did I want to deprive
my son the chance...

03:23.780 --> 03:26.790
...to catch a fish like this
of his own?

03:27.790 --> 03:29.620
This ladyfish and I...

03:29.790 --> 03:34.330
- Well, we had the same destiny.
- "We were part of the same equation."

03:35.290 --> 03:37.340
Now, you may well ask...

03:37.800 --> 03:41.550
Oh, darling, darling,
it's still your night.

03:41.800 --> 03:47.680
...why did it strike so quick on gold
when nothing else would attract it?

03:47.810 --> 03:50.890
That was the lesson
I learned that day...

03:50.890 --> 03:53.810
...the day my son was born.

03:54.310 --> 04:00.320
Sometimes the only way to catch
an uncatchable woman...

04:00.320 --> 04:03.740
...is to offer her a wedding ring.

04:12.330 --> 04:15.080
What, a father's not allowed
to talk about his son?

04:15.330 --> 04:17.170
I'm a footnote in that story, Dad...

04:17.340 --> 04:23.430
...the context for your great adventure,
which never happened, incidentally.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.430
You were selling novelty products
in Wichita when I was born.

04:26.850 --> 04:29.470
Come on, Will.
Everyone loves that story!

04:29.470 --> 04:33.640
They don't. I don't love that story. Not
anymore. Not after a thousand times!

04:33.850 --> 04:37.770
I know every punch line, Dad.
I can tell them as well as you can!

04:38.860 --> 04:41.440
For one night,
one night in your entire life...

04:41.860 --> 04:44.950
...the universe did not revolve
around Edward Bloom.

04:44.950 --> 04:49.370
- How can you not understand that?
- I'm sorry to embarrass you.

04:49.370 --> 04:53.250
You're embarrassing yourself, Dad.
You just don't see it.

04:55.370 --> 04:59.380
After that night, I didn't speak
to my father again for three years.

05:04.880 --> 05:08.850
William Bloom, United Press
International. If I could just...

05:12.890 --> 05:15.640
We communicated indirectly, I guess.

05:15.640 --> 05:19.360
In her letters and Christmas cards,
my mother wrote for both of them.

05:19.900 --> 05:24.820
And when I'd call, she'd say Dad was
out driving or swimming in the pool.

05:24.900 --> 05:27.910
True to form, we never
talked about not talking.

05:30.910 --> 05:34.620
The truth is, I didn't see anything
of myself in my father.

05:34.910 --> 05:38.170
And I don't think he saw anything
of himself in me.

05:41.920 --> 05:46.050
We were like strangers
who knew each other very well.

05:50.430 --> 05:52.680
In telling the story
of my father's life...

05:52.930 --> 05:57.480
...it's impossible to separate fact
from fiction, the man from the myth.

06:00.940 --> 06:03.940
The best I can do
is to tell it the way he told me.

06:05.940 --> 06:09.700
It doesn't always make sense,
and most of it never happened.

06:34.970 --> 06:36.980
Give me back my ring!

06:49.990 --> 06:50.910
Thank you!

06:51.490 --> 06:54.620
But that's what kind of story this is.

07:03.500 --> 07:06.710
His birth would set the pace
for his unlikely life.

07:07.010 --> 07:10.010
No longer than most men's,
but larger.

07:10.010 --> 07:12.470
And as strange as his stories got...

07:12.510 --> 07:15.930
...the endings were always
the most surprising of all.

07:43.040 --> 07:45.840
Yes. Yes, he's here.

07:46.550 --> 07:48.340
It's your mother.

07:55.550 --> 07:57.970
And what does Dr. Bennett say?

07:59.560 --> 08:01.440
No, sure, I'll talk to him.

08:02.560 --> 08:04.520
Yeah, I'll wait.

08:05.060 --> 08:06.650
It's bad?

08:06.650 --> 08:10.610
Yeah, it's more than they thought.
They're gonna stop chemo.

08:11.570 --> 08:14.280
- You need to go.
- Probably tonight.

08:15.570 --> 08:18.660
- I'm going with you.
- No, no, no. You shouldn't.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.870
I'm going with you.

08:50.110 --> 08:51.940
Now, which one's it gonna be?

08:52.110 --> 08:54.990
"Monkey in a Barn,"
or "Dog in the Road"?

08:55.360 --> 08:56.030
The one about the witch.

08:55.610 --> 08:56.990
The one about the witch.

09:00.620 --> 09:04.250
- You get nightmares.
- But I'm not scared.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.710
Well, neither was I, at first.

09:09.130 --> 09:12.050
Now, this took place
in the swamp outside of Ashton.

09:12.130 --> 09:16.800
Children weren't allowed in the swamp
on account of the snakes, spiders...

09:17.140 --> 09:21.770
...and quicksand that would swallow
you up before you could even scream.

09:22.140 --> 09:24.270
There were five of us
out there that night:

09:24.640 --> 09:27.940
Me, Ruthie, Wilbur Freely...

09:28.150 --> 09:31.820
...and the Price Brothers,
Don and Zacky.

09:32.150 --> 09:35.950
And not one of us knew
what was in store.

09:36.660 --> 09:40.780
It's common knowledge that most
towns of a certain size have a witch...

09:41.160 --> 09:43.290
...if only to eat
misbehaving children...

09:43.290 --> 09:46.620
...and the occasional puppy
who wanders into her yard.

09:46.670 --> 09:49.750
Witches use those bones
to cast spells and curses...

09:50.170 --> 09:52.670
...and make the land infertile.

09:52.670 --> 09:56.760
- Is it true she got a glass eye?
- I heard she got it from gypsies.

09:56.760 --> 09:58.800
- What's a gypsy?
- Your momma's a gypsy.

09:59.180 --> 10:00.600
Your momma's a bitch.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.850
You shouldn't swear.
There's ladies present.

10:03.180 --> 10:04.350
- Shit.
- Damn.

10:05.180 --> 10:05.680
Screw.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.730
Turn off your flashlights.
She'll see you!

10:08.190 --> 10:10.860
Yet of all the witches in Alabama...

10:10.960 --> 10:13.610
...there was one who was said
to be the most feared.

10:13.690 --> 10:17.740
For she had one glass eye which
was said to contain mystical powers.

10:18.200 --> 10:22.030
I heard if you look right at it,
you'll see how you're gonna die.

10:22.200 --> 10:25.910
That's bull-S-H-l-T, that is.
She's not even a real witch.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.250
If you're so sure, go get that eye.

10:28.250 --> 10:32.840
I heard she keeps it in a box on her
night table. Or are you too scared?

10:33.210 --> 10:35.340
I'll go in right now and get that eye.

10:35.710 --> 10:37.840
- Then do it.
- Fine, I will.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.640
- Fine, you do it.
- Fine, I'm doing it.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.890
Edward, don't!

10:43.220 --> 10:47.180
She'll make soap out of you.
That's what she does.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.900
She makes soap out of people.

11:39.780 --> 11:42.030
Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom...

11:42.280 --> 11:44.950
...and there's some folks
like to see your eye.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.260
- You get The Eye?
- I brought it.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.380
Let's see it.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.180
Whoa, help!

12:18.820 --> 12:22.990
I saw how I was gonna die.
I was old and I fell.

12:23.820 --> 12:26.160
I wasn't old at all.

12:33.830 --> 12:37.130
I was thinking about death and all.
About seeing how you're gonna die.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.170
I mean, on one hand,
if dying was all you thought about...

12:41.340 --> 12:43.090
...it could kind of screw you up.

12:43.340 --> 12:47.100
But it could kind of help you,
couldn't it?

12:47.350 --> 12:51.390
Because, everything else,
you'd know you could survive.

12:53.850 --> 12:56.900
I guess I'm saying I'd like to know.

13:08.870 --> 13:10.870
That's how I go.

13:33.390 --> 13:34.480
Hi, Mom.

13:40.400 --> 13:45.490
- Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
- Yes. He's up with your father now.

13:45.900 --> 13:49.280
- And how is he?
- Well... No, I got it.

13:49.410 --> 13:53.410
He's impossible. He won't eat.
Because he doesn't eat, he's weaker.

13:53.910 --> 13:55.960
Because he's weak,
he doesn't want to eat.

13:55.960 --> 14:00.790
- How much time does he have left?
- You don't talk about that.

14:01.420 --> 14:03.920
Not yet.

14:04.420 --> 14:06.010
Will.

14:06.930 --> 14:09.930
Dr. Bennett. Oh, it's good to see you.

14:10.430 --> 14:13.720
My wife, Josephine.

14:13.930 --> 14:15.180
A pleasure.

14:16.440 --> 14:19.400
- You're seven months.
- To the day!

14:21.440 --> 14:22.610
It's a boy.

14:25.440 --> 14:31.070
Try to get him to drink one of these.
He won't, but go ahead and try.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.160
Dad?

15:29.510 --> 15:31.930
You want some water?

15:48.530 --> 15:52.490
- You are in for a surprise.
- Am I?

15:52.530 --> 15:55.330
Having a kid changes everything.

15:55.530 --> 15:59.330
There's the diapers and the burping
and the midnight feeding.

15:59.540 --> 16:02.540
- Did you do any of that?
- No.

16:03.540 --> 16:05.540
But I hear it's terrible.

16:06.040 --> 16:11.220
Then you spend years trying
to corrupt and mislead this child...

16:11.220 --> 16:16.100
...fill its head with nonsense,
and still it turns out perfectly fine.

16:16.560 --> 16:21.190
- You think I'm up for it?
- You learned from the best.

16:25.060 --> 16:27.480
Drink half the can.
I'll tell Mom you drank it all.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.530
Everyone wins.

16:30.070 --> 16:33.990
People needn't worry so much.
It's not my time yet.

16:34.070 --> 16:36.030
This is not how I go.

16:36.070 --> 16:40.200
- Really?
- Truly. I saw it in The Eye.

16:41.080 --> 16:44.370
- The old lady by the swamp?
- She was a witch.

16:44.580 --> 16:47.250
No, she was old and probably senile.

16:47.590 --> 16:52.720
I saw my death in that eye,
and this isn't how it happens.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.800
So how does it happen?

16:55.090 --> 16:59.520
Surprise ending.
Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.440
Your mother thought
we wouldn't talk again.

17:03.600 --> 17:06.400
Look at us. We're talking fine.

17:06.610 --> 17:08.440
We're storytellers, both of us.

17:08.610 --> 17:14.150
I speak mine out,
you write yours down. Same thing.

17:15.610 --> 17:17.280
Dad...

17:20.120 --> 17:22.620
I hope to talk about some things
while I'm here.

17:23.620 --> 17:25.250
You mean while I'm here.

17:25.620 --> 17:29.380
I just want to know
the true versions of things:

17:29.630 --> 17:32.420
Events. Stories.

17:32.630 --> 17:33.970
You.

17:45.640 --> 17:48.270
Your mother hasn't been
keeping up the pool.

17:48.270 --> 17:51.980
- lf you wanted to, you could fix it.
- Yeah, I will.

17:52.150 --> 17:55.280
- You know where the chemicals are?
- I did it when you were gone.

17:55.650 --> 18:01.620
I was never much for being
at home, Will. Too confining.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.710
And this here, being stuck in bed...

18:05.160 --> 18:08.540
Dying is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

18:09.670 --> 18:15.380
- I thought you said you weren't dying.
- I said this isn't how I go.

18:15.380 --> 18:19.090
The last part is much more unusual.

18:19.680 --> 18:21.930
Trust me on that.

18:54.710 --> 18:57.670
Dr. Bennett said I have
to stay at home for a week.

18:57.720 --> 19:01.430
Oh, that's nothing. Once,
I had to stay in bed for three years.

19:01.720 --> 19:04.890
- Did you have the chickenpox?
- I wish.

19:24.240 --> 19:27.000
Truth is, no one quite knew
what was wrong.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.620
Most times a person
grows up gradually...

19:30.250 --> 19:32.540
...while I found myself in a hurry.

19:35.750 --> 19:39.880
My muscles and my bones couldn't
keep up with my body's ambition.

19:40.260 --> 19:43.300
So I spent the better part
of three years confined to my bed...

19:43.760 --> 19:47.680
...with the encyclopedia being
my only means of exploration.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.770
I had made it all the way to the G's...

19:50.270 --> 19:52.940
...hoping to find an answer
to my "gigantificationism"...

19:53.770 --> 19:56.860
...when I uncovered an article
about the common goldfish.

19:57.280 --> 20:00.700
"Kept in a small bowl,
the goldfish will remain small.

20:01.280 --> 20:02.530
With more space...

20:02.780 --> 20:06.620
...the fish will grow double, triple,
or quadruple its size."

20:06.790 --> 20:10.000
It occurred to me then that perhaps
the reason for my growth...

20:10.290 --> 20:12.420
...was that I was intended
for larger things.

20:12.790 --> 20:16.380
After all, a giant man can't have
an ordinary-sized life.

20:17.800 --> 20:21.180
As soon as my bones had settled
in their adult configuration...

20:21.300 --> 20:26.260
...I set upon my plan to make
a bigger place for myself in Ashton.

20:26.310 --> 20:27.470
Tigers, go!

20:43.320 --> 20:44.910
Edward Bloom!

21:27.870 --> 21:31.870
Doggy! My doggy!
My doggy's trapped!

21:40.880 --> 21:43.880
I was the biggest thing
Ashton had ever seen.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.890
Until one day, a stranger arrived.

22:02.900 --> 22:07.570
Calm down. Calm down, everybody.
Calm down. That's enough.

22:07.910 --> 22:11.700
- Mr. Mayor, he ate an entire corn field.
- He ate my dog.

22:11.910 --> 22:14.540
If you ain't gonna stop him, mayor,
we will.

22:14.540 --> 22:17.420
I won't have mob violence
in this town.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.840
Now, has someone tried
talking to him?

22:19.920 --> 22:22.590
- You can't reason with him.
- He's a monster.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.630
I'll do it.

22:38.940 --> 22:41.360
I'll talk to him.
See if I can get him to go.

22:41.440 --> 22:43.730
That creature could crush you
without trying.

22:44.440 --> 22:47.450
Oh, trust me, he'll have to try.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.850
Hello?

23:24.980 --> 23:27.780
My name is Edward Bloom,
and I wanna talk to you!

23:28.490 --> 23:30.780
Go away!

23:32.990 --> 23:36.040
Now, I'm not going anywhere
until you show yourself!

23:36.040 --> 23:39.000
I said, go away!

23:59.520 --> 24:01.850
Armed with the foreknowledge
of my own death...

24:02.020 --> 24:04.110
...I knew the giant couldn't kill me.

24:06.530 --> 24:09.740
All the same, I preferred to keep
my bones unbroken.

24:10.030 --> 24:11.990
Why are you here?

24:14.030 --> 24:14.910
So you can eat me.

24:15.530 --> 24:19.290
The town decided to send
a human sacrifice and I volunteered.

24:20.040 --> 24:23.000
My arms are a little stringy, but
there's some good eating in my legs.

24:23.040 --> 24:26.880
I mean, I'd be tempted
to eat them myself.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.590
So I guess, well...

24:31.050 --> 24:35.220
If you'd just get it over with quick,
because I'm not much for pain, really.

24:47.570 --> 24:51.150
Oh, come on! I can't go back!
I'm a human sacrifice!

24:52.070 --> 24:53.950
If I go back,
they'll think I'm a coward.

24:54.070 --> 24:56.700
I'd rather be dinner than a coward.

24:57.580 --> 24:58.700
Here.

24:59.080 --> 25:02.120
You can start with my hand.
It'll be an appetizer.

25:02.580 --> 25:06.790
I don't want to eat you.
I don't want to eat anybody.

25:06.790 --> 25:10.630
I just get so hungry.
I'm just too big.

25:12.090 --> 25:14.890
Did you ever think that
maybe you're not too big...

25:15.090 --> 25:17.180
...but maybe this town
is just too small?

25:17.180 --> 25:19.970
I've heard in real cities
there are buildings so tall...

25:20.100 --> 25:22.430
...you can't even see
the tops of them.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.980
- Really?
- Oh, I wouldn't lie to you.

25:25.100 --> 25:27.520
And all-you-can-eat buffets.

25:27.610 --> 25:30.570
- Now, you can eat a lot, can't you?
- I can.

25:30.610 --> 25:33.530
So why are you wasting your time
in a small town?

25:34.110 --> 25:37.160
You're a big man.
You should be in a big city.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.240
You're just trying to get me
to leave, aren't you?

25:40.620 --> 25:44.040
- What's your name, giant?
- Karl.

25:44.120 --> 25:47.630
Well, mine's Edward.
And truthfully...

25:48.130 --> 25:51.920
Well, I do want you to leave, Karl.
But I want to leave with you.

25:52.130 --> 25:54.930
I mean, you think this town
is too small for you?

25:55.130 --> 25:58.180
Well, it's too small for a man
of my ambition.

25:58.180 --> 26:01.270
So, what do you say? Join me?

26:04.640 --> 26:05.770
Okay.

26:07.150 --> 26:08.690
Okay.

26:08.690 --> 26:11.780
Now, first, we gotta
get you ready for the city.

26:28.670 --> 26:32.880
Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton...

26:33.170 --> 26:36.720
...it's with a heavy heart
that we see you go.

26:37.180 --> 26:39.850
But take with you
this key to the city...

26:39.850 --> 26:42.600
...and know that any time
you want to come back...

26:42.680 --> 26:45.730
...all our doors are open to you.

26:54.690 --> 26:58.700
That afternoon as I left Ashton,
everyone seemed to have advice.

26:58.700 --> 27:01.830
Find yourself a nice girl, now!

27:02.200 --> 27:05.200
Watch your pride, Edward Bloom!

27:05.200 --> 27:09.920
But there was one person whose
counsel I held above all others.

27:13.710 --> 27:16.300
She said that the biggest fish
in the river...

27:17.220 --> 27:19.840
...gets that way
by never being caught.

27:24.220 --> 27:27.680
- What'd she say?
- Beats me.

27:40.240 --> 27:41.370
There were two roads out of Ashton:

27:42.240 --> 27:44.620
A new one which was paved
and an older one that wasn't.

27:44.740 --> 27:46.750
People didn't use
the old one anymore...

27:46.750 --> 27:49.540
...and it had developed a reputation
for being haunted.

27:49.750 --> 27:52.880
Well, since I had no intention
of ever returning to Ashton...

27:53.250 --> 27:57.380
...this seemed as good a time as any
to find out what lay down that old one.

27:57.760 --> 28:02.340
- You know anyone who's taken it?
- That poet, Norther Winslow, did.

28:02.760 --> 28:05.140
He was going to Paris, France.

28:05.260 --> 28:08.770
I guess he liked it.
No one ever heard from him again.

28:09.270 --> 28:11.350
I'll tell you what.
You go the other way.

28:11.350 --> 28:14.900
I'll cut through here,
and I'll meet you on the far side.

28:16.280 --> 28:19.320
You're just trying to run away,
aren't you?

28:20.780 --> 28:21.950
Here.

28:23.280 --> 28:26.540
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.

29:05.820 --> 29:08.330
Why, you son of a...

29:34.350 --> 29:36.360
Now, there comes a point
when a reasonable man...

29:36.360 --> 29:41.150
...will swallow his pride and admit
that he's made a terrible mistake.

29:41.360 --> 29:46.280
The truth is,
I was never a reasonable man.

29:47.370 --> 29:50.080
And what I recall of
Sunday school was that...

29:50.370 --> 29:55.420
...the more difficult something is,
the more rewarding it is in the end.

30:54.600 --> 30:57.140
Friend! Welcome to you!

30:58.100 --> 31:01.060
- What's your name?
- Edward Bloom.

31:02.110 --> 31:05.110
- "Bloom" like a flower?
- Yes.

31:05.110 --> 31:09.160
Oh, here! Here you are, right here.
"Edward Bloom."

31:09.620 --> 31:11.990
We weren't expecting you yet.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.160
- You were expecting me?
- Not yet.

31:14.620 --> 31:19.250
- You must've taken a shortcut.
- Why, yes, I did. It almost killed me.

31:19.630 --> 31:23.670
Life will do that to you.
And truthfully, the long way is easier.

31:24.130 --> 31:26.970
- But it's longer.
- Much longer.

31:27.130 --> 31:30.010
And you're here now,
and that's what matters.

31:30.140 --> 31:31.260
What is this place?

31:31.640 --> 31:34.930
The town of Spectre.
Best-kept secret in Alabama!

31:35.140 --> 31:38.440
Now, it says here
you're from Ashton, right?

31:38.640 --> 31:42.020
Last person we had from Ashton
was Norther Winslow.

31:42.150 --> 31:44.070
The poet?
Whatever happened to him?

31:44.150 --> 31:48.400
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink.
I'll tell you all about it.

31:49.150 --> 31:50.360
Hell, I'll have him tell you!

31:51.160 --> 31:54.200
I have to meet somebody,
and I'm already running late.

31:54.200 --> 31:58.040
Now, son, I already told you.
You're early.

32:32.700 --> 32:35.740
Now, tell me if that isn't
the best pie you ever ate.

32:36.700 --> 32:37.660
It truly is.

32:42.210 --> 32:46.380
Well, everything tastes better here.
Even the water is sweet.

32:48.210 --> 32:51.380
Never gets too hot,
too cold, too humid.

32:52.220 --> 32:55.300
At night, the wind goes through
the trees where you'd swear...

32:55.720 --> 32:59.390
...there was a whole symphony
out there playing just for you.

33:02.230 --> 33:03.980
Hey! Jenny!

33:05.230 --> 33:06.520
Come back here!

33:12.240 --> 33:13.530
Jenny!

33:29.250 --> 33:31.010
Hey, I need those.

33:31.760 --> 33:35.180
- There is no softer ground than town.
- That almost rhymes.

33:35.260 --> 33:37.600
He's our poet laureate. Come on.

33:41.270 --> 33:44.650
I agreed to spend the afternoon,
if only to understand...

33:45.270 --> 33:49.440
...the mystery of how a place could
feel so strange and yet so familiar.

33:53.780 --> 33:56.370
I've been working on this poem
for 12 years.

33:56.370 --> 33:58.030
Really?

33:58.280 --> 34:03.540
There's a lot of expectation.
I don't wanna disappoint my fans.

34:03.790 --> 34:05.250
May I?

34:25.810 --> 34:27.440
It's only three lines long.

34:30.820 --> 34:34.110
This is why you should never show
a work in progress.

35:29.880 --> 35:31.840
I got him!

35:47.390 --> 35:49.060
There's leeches in there.

35:49.900 --> 35:52.860
- Did you see that woman?
- What did she look like?

35:53.400 --> 35:56.690
- Well, she was...
- Was she naked?

35:58.900 --> 36:00.450
Yes, she was.

36:00.450 --> 36:04.580
It's not a woman. It's a fish.
No one ever catches her.

36:05.410 --> 36:07.450
Fish looks different
to different people.

36:07.910 --> 36:11.710
My daddy said it looked like the
coon dog he had when he was a kid...

36:12.420 --> 36:14.460
...back from the dead.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.760
Oh, darn.

36:21.930 --> 36:24.260
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

36:24.430 --> 36:28.430
I'm 8. That means when I'm 18,
you'll be 28.

36:28.430 --> 36:33.190
- And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
- You're pretty good at arithmetic.

36:33.440 --> 36:37.820
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48.
That's not much difference at all.

36:37.940 --> 36:40.740
Sure is a lot now, though, huh?

37:14.480 --> 37:17.150
Hey, Edward!

37:30.500 --> 37:32.580
I love Spectre...

37:38.500 --> 37:40.420
Excuse me.

37:46.510 --> 37:49.810
Jenny thinks you're quite a catch.
We all do.

37:51.020 --> 37:52.560
What?

37:52.560 --> 37:55.650
I said, you're quite a catch.

38:18.040 --> 38:19.800
I have to leave.

38:23.550 --> 38:24.800
Tonight.

38:25.550 --> 38:26.720
Why?

38:28.050 --> 38:30.390
This town is more than any man
could ask for.

38:31.060 --> 38:34.600
And if I were to end up here,
I would consider myself lucky.

38:34.600 --> 38:38.440
But the truth is, I'm just not ready
to end up anywhere.

38:39.060 --> 38:40.730
But no one's ever left.

38:42.070 --> 38:45.450
How are you gonna make it
without your shoes?

38:45.570 --> 38:48.030
Well, I suspect it will hurt. A lot.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.710
Now, I'm sorry, but...
Well, goodbye.

38:58.580 --> 39:02.090
- You won't find a better place.
- I don't expect to.

39:07.590 --> 39:09.260
Promise me you'll come back.

39:10.600 --> 39:15.390
I promise. Someday.
When I'm really supposed to.

39:46.630 --> 39:49.930
That night,
I reached two conclusions.

39:50.140 --> 39:55.060
The first was that a dangerous path
is made much worse by darkness.

39:56.140 --> 40:00.150
The second was that I was
hopelessly and irrevocably lost.

40:00.650 --> 40:03.610
These woods would become
my graveyard.

40:05.650 --> 40:10.530
As difficult as it was to reach Spectre,
I was fated to get there eventually.

40:11.160 --> 40:15.080
After all, no man can avoid
reaching the end of his life.

40:29.170 --> 40:33.510
And then I realized
this wasn't the end of my life.

40:33.680 --> 40:36.640
This isn't how I die.

40:53.700 --> 40:54.910
Friend.

40:55.700 --> 40:59.830
- What happened to your shoes?
- They kind of got ahead of me.

41:16.220 --> 41:19.390
I don't know if you saw it,
but Josephine had some photos...

41:19.730 --> 41:21.140
...in the most recent Newsweek.

41:23.730 --> 41:25.060
Really?

41:25.230 --> 41:26.610
That's just wonderful.

41:29.230 --> 41:33.030
I spent a week in Morocco
for the story. It was incredible.

41:33.240 --> 41:37.740
Oh. We'll have to pick up a copy.

41:47.750 --> 41:50.760
I don't know if you're aware of this,
Josephine...

41:52.260 --> 41:56.800
...but African parrots, in their native
Congo, they speak only French.

41:57.760 --> 41:58.930
Really?

41:59.770 --> 42:02.980
You're lucky to get four words
out of them in English.

42:03.270 --> 42:06.100
But if you were to walk
through the jungle...

42:06.270 --> 42:09.980
...you'd hear them speaking
the most elaborate French.

42:10.780 --> 42:15.860
Those parrots talk about everything.
Politics, movies, fashion.

42:15.860 --> 42:18.450
Everything but religion.

42:19.790 --> 42:20.990
Why not religion, Dad?

42:21.790 --> 42:26.250
It's rude to talk about religion. You
never know who you're gonna offend.

42:31.800 --> 42:34.930
Josephine actually went
to the Congo last year.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.760
Oh, so you know.

42:54.320 --> 42:56.780
Hello.

42:56.820 --> 42:59.070
Hi. How are you feeling?

43:00.330 --> 43:04.160
Oh, I was dreaming.

43:04.330 --> 43:07.500
What were you dreaming about?

43:07.830 --> 43:10.790
Oh, I don't usually remember...

43:10.840 --> 43:15.090
...unless they're especially portentous.
Do you know what that word means?

43:15.840 --> 43:18.470
It means when you dream about
something that's gonna happen.

43:19.340 --> 43:21.850
Like one night, I had a dream...

43:21.850 --> 43:26.640
...where this crow came and said:

43:26.850 --> 43:29.400
"Your aunt is gonna die."

43:30.860 --> 43:33.980
I was so scared,
I woke up my parents...

43:33.980 --> 43:37.990
...but they said it was just a dream
and to get back to bed.

43:38.360 --> 43:41.910
But the next morning,
my Aunt Stacy was dead.

43:42.370 --> 43:44.290
That's terrible.

43:44.370 --> 43:50.080
Terrible for her, but think about me,
young boy with that kind of power.

43:50.380 --> 43:55.050
Wasn't three weeks later when the
crow came back to me in a dream...

43:55.050 --> 43:59.590
...and said, "Your daddy's gonna die."

44:01.390 --> 44:02.850
I didn't know what to do.

44:02.890 --> 44:06.520
I finally told my father, but he said:

44:06.890 --> 44:12.690
"Oh, not to worry."
But I could see he was rattled.

44:12.900 --> 44:15.690
The next morning, he wasn't himself.

44:15.900 --> 44:20.320
Kept looking around, waiting for
something to drop on his head.

44:20.910 --> 44:25.910
Because the crow didn't say how it
was gonna happen, just those words:

44:25.910 --> 44:28.040
"Your daddy's gonna die."

44:28.910 --> 44:34.800
Well, he left home early
and was gone a long time.

44:34.920 --> 44:37.670
When he finally came back,
he looked terrible...

44:37.920 --> 44:41.090
...like he was waiting
for the ax to fall all day.

44:41.930 --> 44:43.680
He said to my mother:

44:43.930 --> 44:47.680
"I've just had the worst day of my life."

44:47.930 --> 44:51.850
"You think you've had a bad day?"
she said.

44:51.940 --> 44:56.980
"This morning, the milkman
dropped dead on the porch."

44:59.440 --> 45:03.740
Because, see, my mother
was banging the milkman.

45:05.450 --> 45:10.120
- Can I take your picture?
- Oh, you don't need a picture.

45:10.120 --> 45:14.080
Just look up the word "handsome"
in the dictionary.

45:14.460 --> 45:15.670
Please?

45:17.460 --> 45:18.960
All right.

45:22.470 --> 45:24.470
I have photos of the wedding
to show you.

45:24.970 --> 45:26.970
There is a great one
of you and my father.

45:33.480 --> 45:38.110
I want to see pictures of your wedding.
I've never seen any.

45:38.110 --> 45:41.610
That's because we didn't have
a proper wedding.

45:41.990 --> 45:45.240
Your mother-in-law was
never supposed to marry me.

45:45.490 --> 45:49.290
- She was engaged to somebody else.
- I never knew.

45:49.490 --> 45:52.120
Will never told you?

45:52.500 --> 45:54.790
Probably just as well.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.630
He would have told it wrong, anyway.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.130
All the facts, none of the flavor.

46:01.510 --> 46:05.180
Oh. So this is a tall tale.

46:06.010 --> 46:09.310
Well, it's not a short one.

46:12.020 --> 46:13.890
I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.

46:14.020 --> 46:14.650
I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.

46:15.100 --> 46:16.940
I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.

46:17.020 --> 46:19.900
Not knowing what
that would be exactly...

46:20.030 --> 46:24.860
...I explored every opportunity
that presented itself.

46:54.060 --> 46:57.810
Coco! Coco! There they are.

46:59.060 --> 47:02.360
Ladies and gentlemen!

47:03.070 --> 47:06.660
You may think
you've seen the unusual.

47:07.570 --> 47:12.200
You may think you've seen the bizarre.

47:13.080 --> 47:17.880
But I've traveled
to the five corners of the world...

47:18.080 --> 47:25.050
...and let me tell you,
I've never seen anything like this!

47:30.100 --> 47:32.060
When I met this man...

47:32.600 --> 47:35.270
...he was picking oranges in Florida.

47:35.270 --> 47:39.060
His fellow workers called him
El Penumbra. "The Shadow."

47:41.110 --> 47:43.570
Because when you worked
beside him...

47:44.110 --> 47:46.240
...he blocked out the daylight!

47:47.110 --> 47:51.070
Not to alarm you, ma'am,
but if this man wanted to...

47:51.620 --> 47:56.080
...he could crush your head
between his toes...

47:56.120 --> 47:59.540
...like a tiny walnut.
But he won't do it.

48:00.130 --> 48:02.250
No. No, ladies and gentlemen...

48:02.630 --> 48:04.670
...he will not hurt her...

48:05.130 --> 48:08.550
...because he is our own gentle giant.

48:10.140 --> 48:16.230
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Colossus!

49:40.730 --> 49:44.350
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls...

49:44.350 --> 49:46.520
...thank y'all for coming.

49:47.730 --> 49:50.610
Drive home safely, everyone.
Thank you for coming.

49:51.240 --> 49:54.740
It was on that night
Karl met his destiny.

49:55.740 --> 49:58.490
And I met mine, almost.

49:58.740 --> 50:03.540
They say when you meet
the love of your life, time stops.

50:03.750 --> 50:05.250
And that's true.

50:50.300 --> 50:53.340
What they don't tell you
is that once time starts again...

50:54.300 --> 50:57.930
...it moves extra fast to catch up.

51:30.840 --> 51:32.300
What's your name?

51:33.340 --> 51:37.220
- It's Karl.
- Karl.

51:42.850 --> 51:48.400
Tell me, Karl, have you ever heard
the term "involuntary servitude"?

51:48.400 --> 51:51.150
- No.
- "Unconscionable contract"?

51:53.360 --> 51:56.200
- Nope.
- Great.

51:56.360 --> 51:58.360
Here you go.

51:59.870 --> 52:01.580
Here you are.

52:04.870 --> 52:07.620
Mr. Soggybottom,
come down this here...

52:07.870 --> 52:10.040
...so he can use your back
to sign on it.

52:22.890 --> 52:25.020
Okay. Thank you. Yeah.

52:26.390 --> 52:28.270
Hey, kid.

52:28.390 --> 52:31.690
- Your friend just made himself a star.
- Oh, that's great.

52:34.400 --> 52:36.490
- My attorney, Mr. Soggybottom.
- Good to meet you.

52:36.900 --> 52:38.530
Pleased to meet you.

52:43.410 --> 52:46.410
What's the matter? I haven't
seen a customer so depressed...

52:46.910 --> 52:50.210
...since the elephant sat
on that farmer's wife.

52:51.420 --> 52:53.500
"Depressed"?

52:55.420 --> 52:57.710
See? The big guy likes it.

52:58.420 --> 53:00.430
I just saw the woman I'm gonna marry.

53:00.430 --> 53:03.470
I know it. But I lost her.

53:04.930 --> 53:06.310
Oh, tough break.

53:06.430 --> 53:10.270
Well, most men have to get married
before they lose their wives.

53:10.390 --> 53:15.480
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
looking for her. That or die alone.

53:15.940 --> 53:17.780
Damn, kid.

53:20.950 --> 53:23.410
Let me guess. Real pretty?

53:24.410 --> 53:26.290
Reddish-blondish hair?

53:28.410 --> 53:29.710
Blue dress?

53:30.960 --> 53:32.420
Yeah!

53:32.960 --> 53:35.920
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.

53:35.960 --> 53:38.090
Who is she? Where does she live?

53:38.420 --> 53:41.260
Forget it. Don't waste your time.
She's out of your league.

53:41.430 --> 53:44.800
- What? You don't even know me.
- Sure I do.

53:44.970 --> 53:49.470
You were hot shit back in Hickville, but
here in the real world, you got squat.

53:49.470 --> 53:51.390
You don't have a plan or a job.

53:51.980 --> 53:54.440
Nothing except the clothes
on your back.

53:54.440 --> 53:57.360
Well, I have a whole backpack
full of clothes.

53:58.980 --> 54:01.740
Oh, someone stole my backpack.

54:02.450 --> 54:06.410
You were a big fish in a small pond,
but this here is the ocean...

54:06.450 --> 54:08.910
...and you're drowning.
Go back to Puddleville.

54:09.450 --> 54:12.500
- You'll be happy there.
- You say I don't have a plan. I do.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.630
I'll find that girl, marry her,
and spend the rest of my life with her.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.710
I don't have a job, but I would
have a job if you gave me one.

54:21.010 --> 54:22.970
And I may not have much...

54:23.010 --> 54:26.680
...but I have more determination
than any man you're likely to meet.

54:29.010 --> 54:32.640
I'm sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Come on, big boy.

54:33.480 --> 54:35.810
Wait. Look, I'll work
night and day for you...

54:36.480 --> 54:37.650
...and you won't have to pay me.

54:40.030 --> 54:42.990
You just have to tell me who she is.

54:46.490 --> 54:48.490
Every month you work for me...

54:48.490 --> 54:51.830
...l'll tell you one thing about her.
That's my final offer.

54:56.040 --> 54:58.590
Let's get started.

55:12.060 --> 55:15.690
From that moment on, I did everything
Mr. Calloway asked.

55:15.690 --> 55:18.440
I'd go three days
without stopping to eat.

55:18.520 --> 55:21.190
And four days without sleeping.

55:21.530 --> 55:24.360
What kept me going was
the promise of meeting the girl...

55:24.530 --> 55:25.740
...who would be my wife.

55:33.540 --> 55:35.870
Stick together, that's the way
it's gonna be.

55:36.080 --> 55:39.920
- The way it was, and the way it will be.
- Mr. Calloway, sir?

55:40.090 --> 55:41.630
It's been a month today.

55:44.090 --> 55:47.220
This girl, the love of your life...

55:48.090 --> 55:52.640
...her favorite flowers are daffodils.

55:53.560 --> 55:57.520
- So get that stuff...
- Daffodils.

55:58.560 --> 56:00.900
Daffodils.

56:02.570 --> 56:04.740
Daffodils.

56:10.570 --> 56:12.240
True to his word...

56:12.580 --> 56:15.200
...every month Amos would tell me
something new...

56:15.580 --> 56:17.870
...about the woman of my dreams.

56:18.120 --> 56:21.000
Enjoy yourselves, enjoy yourselves.

56:21.130 --> 56:22.670
She's going to college.

56:23.130 --> 56:27.300
College. She's going to college.

56:37.600 --> 56:38.980
She likes music.

56:39.600 --> 56:43.400
Music. She likes music.

56:48.150 --> 56:50.160
Over the months, I learned a lot
about the woman I would marry...

56:50.160 --> 56:52.780
Over the months, I learned a lot
about the woman I would marry...

56:52.780 --> 56:55.740
...but not her name,
and not where to find her.

56:55.740 --> 57:00.370
That time had come.
I couldn't wait any longer.

57:11.640 --> 57:13.850
Mr. Calloway?

57:16.180 --> 57:19.560
It's Edward Bloom.
I need to talk to you.

57:23.650 --> 57:25.980
Mr. Calloway?

58:00.230 --> 58:01.890
No. Wait!

58:19.700 --> 58:24.170
That night, I discovered that most
things you consider evil or wicked...

58:24.250 --> 58:28.090
...are simply lonely and lacking
in social niceties.

59:02.750 --> 59:04.830
Didn't kill anything, did I?

59:05.750 --> 59:10.090
A few rabbits. But I think one of them
was already dead.

59:13.300 --> 59:16.260
That would explain the indigestion.

59:23.770 --> 59:25.690
Thank you.

59:27.770 --> 59:29.610
I was wrong about you, kid.

59:29.770 --> 59:33.110
You may not have much,
but what you got, you got a lot of.

59:33.780 --> 59:36.110
You could get any girl.

59:36.320 --> 59:38.280
There's only one I want.

59:42.790 --> 59:44.040
Her name...

59:47.790 --> 59:49.920
...is Sandra Templeton.

59:51.800 --> 59:54.760
She goes to Auburn.

59:54.800 --> 59:59.050
Semester's almost over,
so you better hurry.

59:59.340 --> 1:00:00.850
Thank you. Thank you.

1:00:01.810 --> 1:00:04.220
- Good luck, kid!
- Thank you, sir!

1:00:16.950 --> 1:00:17.280
- Bye, now.
- Bye, Edward.

1:00:20.990 --> 1:00:24.330
After saying my goodbyes,
I hopped three trains...

1:00:24.540 --> 1:00:27.960
...to get to Auburn that afternoon.

1:01:03.030 --> 1:01:06.870
You don't know me,
but my name is Edward Bloom...

1:01:07.040 --> 1:01:08.330
...and I love you.

1:01:10.040 --> 1:01:13.790
I've spent the last three years
working to find out who you are.

1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:18.260
I've been shot, stabbed, and trampled
a few times. I broke my ribs twice.

1:01:18.590 --> 1:01:21.550
But it's all been worth it
to see you here now...

1:01:22.050 --> 1:01:25.010
...and to finally get to talk to you.

1:01:25.060 --> 1:01:27.350
Because I'm destined to marry you.

1:01:28.060 --> 1:01:34.020
I knew it when I saw you at the circus,
and I know it now more than ever.

1:01:36.070 --> 1:01:39.400
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have to apologize to me.

1:01:39.400 --> 1:01:41.490
I'm the luckiest person
you'll find today.

1:01:42.070 --> 1:01:45.160
No, I'm sorry I'm engaged
to be married.

1:01:52.080 --> 1:01:55.210
But you're wrong. I do know you.

1:01:55.630 --> 1:01:57.590
At least by reputation.

1:01:58.630 --> 1:02:01.090
Edward Bloom from Ashton.

1:02:01.090 --> 1:02:05.550
See, I'm actually engaged
to a boy from Ashton. Don Price.

1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:09.180
He was a few years older than you.

1:02:20.110 --> 1:02:21.490
Well...

1:02:24.110 --> 1:02:25.200
Congratulations.

1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:30.700
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

1:02:36.130 --> 1:02:39.170
Stop it! It's not funny.

1:02:40.130 --> 1:02:42.260
That poor boy.

1:02:42.670 --> 1:02:45.760
Fate has a cruel way
of circling around on you.

1:02:46.140 --> 1:02:48.140
After all this work to leave Ashton...

1:02:48.140 --> 1:02:53.640
...the girl I love was now engaged
to one of its biggest jerks.

1:02:54.140 --> 1:02:56.310
There's a time when a man
needs to fight...

1:02:56.310 --> 1:02:59.690
...and a time when he needs to accept
that his destiny's lost...

1:03:00.150 --> 1:03:04.240
...the ship has sailed,
and that only a fool will continue.

1:03:04.240 --> 1:03:07.370
Truth is, I've always been a fool.

1:03:08.700 --> 1:03:13.410
Sandra Templeton, I love you,
and I will marry you!

1:03:18.290 --> 1:03:18.590
So as you can see, if we apply
these rules to our everyday life...

1:03:22.170 --> 1:03:25.090
...supply and demand
makes much more sense.

1:03:25.180 --> 1:03:29.140
Take a look at the next graph, and the
import of this will be even stronger...

1:03:38.190 --> 1:03:40.900
- for three hours.

1:03:40.900 --> 1:03:42.570
Look!

1:04:13.720 --> 1:04:16.890
- Daffodils!
- They're your favorite flower.

1:04:17.230 --> 1:04:18.730
How did you get so many?

1:04:19.730 --> 1:04:21.320
I called everywhere in five states.

1:04:21.730 --> 1:04:24.690
I told them it was the only way
to get my wife to marry me.

1:04:26.740 --> 1:04:28.490
You don't even know me.

1:04:29.240 --> 1:04:31.740
I have the rest of my life to find out.

1:04:32.740 --> 1:04:34.410
Sandra!

1:04:36.750 --> 1:04:38.920
It's Don. Promise you won't hurt him.

1:04:38.920 --> 1:04:41.710
If that's what you want, I swear to it.

1:04:42.250 --> 1:04:44.590
- Bloom?
- Don.

1:04:45.760 --> 1:04:50.050
What the hell are you doing?
This is my girl. Mine!

1:04:50.260 --> 1:04:52.890
I wasn't aware
that she belonged to anyone.

1:04:55.770 --> 1:04:58.770
What's the matter?
Are you too scared to fight back?

1:04:59.270 --> 1:05:00.940
I promised I wouldn't.

1:05:01.770 --> 1:05:04.570
Stop it!

1:05:04.780 --> 1:05:05.980
Don, stop!

1:05:06.780 --> 1:05:11.820
While I took the beating of a lifetime,
Don Price was ultimately defeated.

1:05:11.820 --> 1:05:16.580
All the physical activity had worsened
a congenital valve defect.

1:05:16.790 --> 1:05:18.910
Put simply, his heart
wasn't strong enough.

1:05:31.800 --> 1:05:34.140
Don! I will never marry you.

1:05:34.810 --> 1:05:37.520
What?
You mean, you love this guy?

1:05:37.810 --> 1:05:40.940
He's almost a stranger,
and I prefer him to you.

1:06:09.340 --> 1:06:14.800
As it turned out, Sandra was able to
keep her same date at the chapel.

1:06:14.850 --> 1:06:17.970
Only the groom had changed.

1:06:18.850 --> 1:06:22.850
I thought you said you didn't
have a church wedding.

1:06:22.850 --> 1:06:25.940
We were all set to,
but there was a complication.

1:06:29.860 --> 1:06:33.610
Is it the medicine
that's making you thirsty?

1:06:34.870 --> 1:06:37.950
Truth is,
I've been thirsty my whole life.

1:06:38.870 --> 1:06:41.460
Never really known why.

1:06:42.870 --> 1:06:45.040
There was a time when I was 11...

1:06:45.040 --> 1:06:46.790
You were talking about your wedding.

1:06:47.380 --> 1:06:51.300
I didn't forget.
I was just working on a tangent.

1:06:51.880 --> 1:06:55.090
You see, most men, they'll tell you
a story straight through.

1:06:55.390 --> 1:06:59.140
It won't be complicated,
but it won't be interesting, either.

1:06:59.890 --> 1:07:01.270
I like your stories.

1:07:01.270 --> 1:07:01.390
And I like you.

1:07:01.890 --> 1:07:03.270
And I like you.

1:07:03.270 --> 1:07:03.690
Well, when you work for the circus,
you don't have a regular address.

1:07:04.140 --> 1:07:07.770
Well, when you work for the circus,
you don't have a regular address.

1:07:07.900 --> 1:07:11.030
So after three years,
there was a lot of undelivered mail.

1:07:11.900 --> 1:07:14.780
During the four weeks
I was in the hospital...

1:07:14.910 --> 1:07:17.370
...the postmaster
finally caught up with me.

1:07:17.410 --> 1:07:20.830
And it seems that while my heart
belonged to Sandra...

1:07:20.910 --> 1:07:26.580
...the rest of my body belonged
to the U.S. government.

1:07:43.930 --> 1:07:47.770
A hitch in the Army was up to
three years at that point...

1:07:47.940 --> 1:07:50.940
...and having waited three years
just to meet Sandra...

1:07:50.940 --> 1:07:54.900
...I knew I couldn't survive
being away from her that long.

1:07:54.950 --> 1:07:58.030
So I took every hazardous
assignment I could find...

1:07:58.450 --> 1:08:02.870
...with the hope of getting
my time down to less than a year.

1:08:02.950 --> 1:08:05.370
Go! Go!

1:08:07.960 --> 1:08:09.960
When I was offered
a secret mission...

1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:13.880
...to steal the plans for
the Wong Kai Tang power plant...

1:08:14.460 --> 1:08:17.760
...I jumped at the chance
to serve my country.

1:08:20.970 --> 1:08:23.140
Go! Go!

1:10:18.590 --> 1:10:21.130
Any of you got needs?

1:12:06.700 --> 1:12:08.700
How could you miss your cue?

1:12:09.200 --> 1:12:13.160
You make me look like a fool
out there alone.

1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:14.790
You weren't alone!

1:12:17.210 --> 1:12:18.330
Who the hell are you?

1:12:18.330 --> 1:12:20.000
I'm not going to hurt you.

1:12:20.210 --> 1:12:21.170
Damn right you're not.

1:12:21.710 --> 1:12:22.670
GUARD!

1:12:24.210 --> 1:12:25.880
Tell your men not to bother us!

1:12:26.220 --> 1:12:27.470
And close that curtain!

1:12:30.220 --> 1:12:32.310
Please, I need your help.

1:12:33.220 --> 1:12:35.640
What makes you think we'll help you?

1:12:44.230 --> 1:12:49.280
Over the next hour, I described
my love for Sandra K. Templeton...

1:12:49.280 --> 1:12:52.120
...and the ordeal that brought me
before them.

1:12:52.240 --> 1:12:55.700
As it had always been,
this love was my salvation.

1:12:56.250 --> 1:12:58.330
It was destined to be.

1:12:58.330 --> 1:13:01.340
We put together an elaborate
plan for escape...

1:13:01.750 --> 1:13:03.880
...involving a whaling ship
to Russia...

1:13:04.250 --> 1:13:08.300
...a barge to Cuba,
and a small, dirty canoe to Miami.

1:13:08.300 --> 1:13:11.510
We all knew it would be dangerous.

1:13:12.260 --> 1:13:14.640
And what are we supposed to do
when we get to America?

1:13:15.270 --> 1:13:16.520
I can get you bookings.

1:13:17.270 --> 1:13:19.600
I know the biggest man
in show business.

1:13:20.770 --> 1:13:21.770
Bob Hope?!

1:13:22.270 --> 1:13:23.230
Bigger.

1:13:27.280 --> 1:13:28.150
Ready?

1:13:31.280 --> 1:13:35.120
And so the twins and I
began our arduous journey...

1:13:35.290 --> 1:13:37.200
...halfway around the world.

1:13:37.290 --> 1:13:41.750
Unfortunately, there was no way
to send a message back to America.

1:13:41.790 --> 1:13:45.750
And so it was no surprise
that the Army believed I was dead.

1:14:02.310 --> 1:14:04.730
No, God!

1:14:06.320 --> 1:14:10.610
After four months, Sandra had gotten
over the worst of the nightmares.

1:14:11.320 --> 1:14:15.160
When the phone rang, she didn't think
it was somehow me calling her.

1:14:15.330 --> 1:14:20.160
When a car drove past, she didn't
get up to check out the window.

1:14:55.370 --> 1:14:58.450
I talked with your father last night.

1:15:01.870 --> 1:15:05.000
You never told me
how your parents met.

1:15:05.380 --> 1:15:07.340
They met at Auburn.

1:15:07.380 --> 1:15:11.170
What about the details?
How they fell in love.

1:15:11.380 --> 1:15:13.300
The circus. The war.

1:15:13.380 --> 1:15:15.300
You never told me any of that.

1:15:15.390 --> 1:15:17.470
That's because most of it
never happened.

1:15:19.390 --> 1:15:21.520
But it's romantic.

1:15:24.900 --> 1:15:27.360
- What?
- What, I know better...

1:15:27.900 --> 1:15:31.190
...than to argue romance
with a French woman.

1:15:32.400 --> 1:15:34.360
Do you love your father?

1:15:34.910 --> 1:15:38.530
Everyone loves my father.
He's a very likable guy.

1:15:39.910 --> 1:15:41.500
Do you love him?

1:15:46.420 --> 1:15:48.380
You have to understand.

1:15:48.420 --> 1:15:52.210
When I was growing up,
he was gone more than he was there.

1:15:52.420 --> 1:15:56.390
And I started thinking maybe he's got
this second life somewhere else.

1:15:57.430 --> 1:16:00.220
Another family, another house.

1:16:00.430 --> 1:16:03.640
And he leaves us
and goes to them.

1:16:03.930 --> 1:16:05.560
Or, or...

1:16:07.940 --> 1:16:12.400
Or maybe there is no second family.
Maybe he never wanted a family.

1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:17.410
Whatever it is, he likes his second life
better and he tells his stories...

1:16:17.950 --> 1:16:20.490
...because he can't stand
this boring place.

1:16:20.490 --> 1:16:23.500
- But it's not true.
- Well, what's true?

1:16:25.460 --> 1:16:28.250
He's never told me
a single true thing.

1:16:30.460 --> 1:16:31.880
Look, hey...

1:16:33.460 --> 1:16:36.260
I know why you like him.

1:16:36.470 --> 1:16:39.720
I know why everyone likes him.

1:16:39.970 --> 1:16:43.180
But I need you to tell me
that I'm not crazy.

1:16:43.470 --> 1:16:46.350
Oh, you're not.

1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:51.230
And I think you should talk to him.

1:16:56.490 --> 1:16:59.570
Larry Puckett's Chevrolet
lets the customer do the talking.

1:16:59.570 --> 1:17:03.200
Larry Puckett's GM-certified vehicles
are under factory warranty.

1:17:03.490 --> 1:17:07.500
And you can save up to 40 percent
off the original MSRP.

1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:10.710
- Did I ever tell you about...?
- Yes.

1:17:11.500 --> 1:17:15.010
The maple tree and the Buick?
We've heard it.

1:17:17.510 --> 1:17:21.050
I know someone who hasn't.

1:17:21.510 --> 1:17:24.970
- The...
- Tree fell on the car, spilling the syrup.

1:17:25.020 --> 1:17:28.440
Which attracted the flies,
which got stuck to it...

1:17:28.520 --> 1:17:31.520
...and flew off with the whole car.

1:17:36.530 --> 1:17:39.910
But the real story
is how I got the car.

1:17:40.530 --> 1:17:41.820
- You see...
- Dad?

1:17:42.030 --> 1:17:43.530
Son.

1:17:43.530 --> 1:17:45.490
Can we talk?

1:17:48.040 --> 1:17:50.330
I think I'll get started
on these dishes.

1:17:50.540 --> 1:17:52.670
I'll help you.

1:18:08.560 --> 1:18:11.810
- You know about icebergs, Dad?
- Do I?

1:18:11.810 --> 1:18:14.060
I saw an iceberg once.

1:18:14.570 --> 1:18:17.780
They were hauling it down to Texas
for drinking water.

1:18:18.070 --> 1:18:22.070
They didn't count on there being
an elephant frozen inside.

1:18:22.070 --> 1:18:24.700
- The woolly kind. A mammoth.
- Dad!

1:18:25.580 --> 1:18:27.290
What?

1:18:29.080 --> 1:18:31.540
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.

1:18:31.580 --> 1:18:34.080
Well, you shouldn't have started
with a question...

1:18:34.590 --> 1:18:36.300
...because people
want to answer questions.

1:18:36.590 --> 1:18:40.220
You should've started with,
"The thing about icebergs is..."

1:18:40.590 --> 1:18:43.890
Okay, okay. The thing about
icebergs is you only see 10 percent.

1:18:44.090 --> 1:18:47.560
The other 90 percent is below
the water where you can't see it.

1:18:47.600 --> 1:18:49.600
And that's...

1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:52.390
...what it is with you, Dad.

1:18:52.600 --> 1:18:55.360
I am only seeing this little bit...

1:18:55.610 --> 1:18:57.440
...that sticks above the water.

1:18:57.610 --> 1:19:00.690
Oh, you're only seeing down
to my nose? My chin? My...

1:19:01.110 --> 1:19:04.030
Dad, I have no idea who you are...

1:19:04.110 --> 1:19:07.240
...because you've never told me
a single fact.

1:19:07.620 --> 1:19:11.830
I've told you a thousand facts, Will.
That's what I do, I tell stories!

1:19:11.830 --> 1:19:15.080
You tell... lies, Dad.

1:19:15.630 --> 1:19:16.840
You tell amusing lies.

1:19:16.840 --> 1:19:19.670
Stories are what you tell
a 5-year-old at bedtime.

1:19:20.130 --> 1:19:22.800
They're not elaborate mythologies
that you maintain...

1:19:23.630 --> 1:19:25.720
...when your son is 10 and 15
and 20 and 30.

1:19:25.720 --> 1:19:28.510
And I believed you.

1:19:30.640 --> 1:19:33.980
I believed your stories
so much longer than I should have.

1:19:34.140 --> 1:19:37.190
Then when I realized
everything you said was impossible...

1:19:37.190 --> 1:19:39.270
...I felt like a fool
to have trusted you.

1:19:39.650 --> 1:19:41.820
You're like Santa Claus
and the Easter Bunny.

1:19:42.150 --> 1:19:43.990
Just as charming and just as fake.

1:19:44.150 --> 1:19:46.490
You think I'm fake.

1:19:47.660 --> 1:19:51.750
Only on the surface, Dad.
But it's all I've ever seen.

1:19:53.660 --> 1:19:55.370
Look.

1:19:56.670 --> 1:19:59.170
I'm about to have...

1:19:59.670 --> 1:20:00.800
...a kid of my own.

1:20:01.170 --> 1:20:03.720
It would kill me
if he went through his whole life...

1:20:04.170 --> 1:20:06.300
...never understanding me.

1:20:06.680 --> 1:20:08.970
It would kill you, huh?

1:20:10.680 --> 1:20:14.270
What do you want, Will?
Who do you want me to be?

1:20:14.690 --> 1:20:16.400
Just yourself.

1:20:16.400 --> 1:20:19.820
Good, bad, everything.
Just show me who you are for once.

1:20:20.190 --> 1:20:23.240
I've been nothing but myself
since the day I was born.

1:20:23.690 --> 1:20:28.120
And if you can't see that,
it's your failing, not mine!

1:20:59.230 --> 1:21:03.690
Your father decided
that he needed to have an office...

1:21:04.230 --> 1:21:07.610
...and, of course, it wouldn't do
to have it in the house.

1:21:07.740 --> 1:21:09.110
So...

1:21:10.740 --> 1:21:15.410
You'll know better than me
what's important.

1:21:25.760 --> 1:21:27.840
What is it?

1:21:29.260 --> 1:21:31.220
It was during the war.

1:21:31.260 --> 1:21:35.140
Your father went missing.
They thought he was dead.

1:21:36.270 --> 1:21:38.560
Oh, that really happened?

1:21:38.770 --> 1:21:42.560
Not everything your father says
is a complete fabrication.

1:21:44.270 --> 1:21:47.240
I think I'll go check on him.

1:21:49.780 --> 1:21:51.780
I need to lie down for a bit.

1:21:52.280 --> 1:21:54.910
Okay, go.

1:22:09.800 --> 1:22:14.720
After the war, the sons of Alabama
returned home, looking for work.

1:22:14.810 --> 1:22:16.600
Each had the advantage over me.

1:22:16.600 --> 1:22:19.770
They were alive,
while I was officially deceased.

1:22:20.310 --> 1:22:22.100
With my prospects few...

1:22:22.310 --> 1:22:26.110
...I took a job as a traveling salesman.
It suited me.

1:22:26.120 --> 1:22:28.900
If there was one thing
you can say about Edward Bloom...

1:22:29.320 --> 1:22:31.450
...it's that I am a social person.

1:22:32.820 --> 1:22:35.870
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

1:22:36.330 --> 1:22:38.790
I could be gone
for weeks at a time.

1:22:39.330 --> 1:22:42.250
But every other Friday,
I put all the money I made...

1:22:42.330 --> 1:22:45.790
...into an account set aside
for a proper house...

1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:48.170
...with a white picket fence.

1:22:53.840 --> 1:22:57.430
I'd like a moment of your time
to tell you about my new product...

1:22:57.850 --> 1:23:00.100
...the Handi-matic.

1:23:15.870 --> 1:23:19.080
A few years later, I added
other products and other cities...

1:23:19.080 --> 1:23:22.460
...until my territory stretched from
the coast to western Texas.

1:23:47.400 --> 1:23:48.770
Edward?

1:23:48.900 --> 1:23:50.570
Edward Bloom!

1:23:50.900 --> 1:23:52.570
It's me, Norther Winslow.

1:23:52.900 --> 1:23:54.780
I don't believe it.

1:23:54.910 --> 1:23:59.120
I was astonished to see the greatest
poet of both Ashton and Spectre...

1:23:59.410 --> 1:24:01.290
...all the way out in Texas.

1:24:01.410 --> 1:24:05.290
I want you to know, when you left
Spectre, it opened my eyes.

1:24:05.420 --> 1:24:08.920
There was a whole life out there
that I was not living.

1:24:08.920 --> 1:24:10.460
So I traveled.

1:24:10.920 --> 1:24:14.010
I saw France, Africa,
half of South America.

1:24:14.010 --> 1:24:16.590
Every day, a new adventure.
That's my motto.

1:24:16.930 --> 1:24:19.010
That's great, Norther.
I'm happy for you.

1:24:19.430 --> 1:24:21.810
What are you doing now?

1:24:22.930 --> 1:24:24.390
I'm robbing this place.

1:24:28.440 --> 1:24:30.190
All right, everybody down!

1:24:31.940 --> 1:24:35.150
Hey!
Just slide that over.

1:24:41.450 --> 1:24:44.250
- Would you mind grabbing that?
- What?

1:24:44.960 --> 1:24:45.830
The gun.

1:24:47.960 --> 1:24:49.790
I'm gonna be cleaning out
the cash drawers...

1:24:49.960 --> 1:24:54.090
...and my associate here
is gonna handle the vault.

1:25:00.470 --> 1:25:03.970
All right, you!
You help my friend, okay?

1:25:04.470 --> 1:25:06.020
Let's go!

1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:27.920
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I am.

1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:31.080
I really just don't want anyone
to get hurt.

1:25:31.500 --> 1:25:33.420
It's not that.

1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:35.960
It's just...

1:25:41.510 --> 1:25:42.970
There's no money.

1:25:44.010 --> 1:25:47.890
We're completely bankrupt.
Don't tell anybody.

1:25:48.020 --> 1:25:51.980
It turned out that the Savings & Loan
had already been robbed...

1:25:52.020 --> 1:25:56.610
...not by armed bandits, but
by speculators in Texas real estate.

1:25:57.030 --> 1:25:58.990
All right, let's go!

1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:12.040
Norther!

1:26:31.560 --> 1:26:34.360
Yeah! There's gotta be
close to $400 here!

1:26:34.570 --> 1:26:36.980
And that's just from the drawers.

1:26:37.070 --> 1:26:39.610
Let's see what you got
from the vault.

1:26:49.580 --> 1:26:52.040
This is it? The whole vault?

1:26:52.580 --> 1:26:55.040
I'm afraid so.

1:26:58.090 --> 1:26:59.760
It's got your deposit slip on it.

1:26:59.760 --> 1:27:01.550
Well, I just didn't want you
leaving empty-handed.

1:27:02.590 --> 1:27:06.180
There's something you should know.
The reason they don't have money...

1:27:06.600 --> 1:27:09.770
I told Norther about
the vagaries of Texas oil money...

1:27:10.100 --> 1:27:12.980
...and its effect on real-estate prices...

1:27:13.100 --> 1:27:16.190
...and how lax enforcement
of fiduciary process...

1:27:16.610 --> 1:27:20.400
...had made savings and loans
particularly vulnerable.

1:27:20.610 --> 1:27:25.410
Hearing this news,
Norther was left with one conclusion:

1:27:25.620 --> 1:27:29.080
I should go to Wall Street.
That's where all the money is.

1:27:29.120 --> 1:27:32.580
I knew then that while my days
as a criminal were over...

1:27:32.620 --> 1:27:33.790
Thanks for the hand!

1:27:34.120 --> 1:27:36.080
...Norther's were just beginning.

1:27:36.130 --> 1:27:38.630
When Norther made
his first million dollars...

1:27:38.630 --> 1:27:40.840
...he sent me a check for 10,000.

1:27:41.130 --> 1:27:45.180
I protested, but he said it was my fee
as his career advisor.

1:27:45.640 --> 1:27:49.060
It was enough to buy my wife
a proper house...

1:27:49.140 --> 1:27:51.100
...with a white picket fence.

1:27:51.140 --> 1:27:55.270
And for that, it was all the riches
a man could ever want.

1:28:29.180 --> 1:28:31.100
I was drying out.

1:28:32.680 --> 1:28:35.100
I see.

1:28:37.190 --> 1:28:41.320
I think we ought to get you
a plant mister...

1:28:41.320 --> 1:28:43.990
...so we can just spray you
like a fern.

1:29:10.220 --> 1:29:12.560
Come, now.

1:29:16.730 --> 1:29:20.020
I don't think I'll ever dry out.

1:30:18.290 --> 1:30:21.250
You carry on. I'll see...

1:30:26.300 --> 1:30:28.090
Hello.

1:30:28.300 --> 1:30:32.220
- Are you Jennifer Hill?
- I am.

1:30:32.300 --> 1:30:34.600
And you're Will.

1:30:34.810 --> 1:30:37.770
I've seen a picture of you.
That's how I recognize you.

1:30:40.310 --> 1:30:43.020
Listen, Kenny,
why don't we skip the lesson today?

1:30:43.310 --> 1:30:45.520
We can go again next week.

1:30:45.820 --> 1:30:47.780
Do I have to give it back to my mom?

1:30:48.320 --> 1:30:50.740
Well, I won't tell her if you won't.

1:31:01.920 --> 1:31:03.250
How did you know my father?

1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:06.040
Well, this was on his sales route...

1:31:06.040 --> 1:31:10.010
...so he was through here all the time,
and everyone in town knew him.

1:31:10.510 --> 1:31:12.510
Were you having an affair?

1:31:15.010 --> 1:31:17.310
Wow. Wow, you just said it.

1:31:18.020 --> 1:31:21.730
I was expecting to dance
around this for another half-hour.

1:31:23.520 --> 1:31:26.520
I've seen him with women.
He flirts. He always has.

1:31:27.020 --> 1:31:31.240
And on some level,
I just presumed that he was...

1:31:31.240 --> 1:31:34.410
...cheating on my mom.
I just never had proof.

1:31:37.530 --> 1:31:39.410
Well, can I ask you a question?

1:31:39.540 --> 1:31:42.330
If you found this deed,
why didn't you just ask Eddie?

1:31:43.040 --> 1:31:45.290
Because he's dying.

1:31:54.550 --> 1:31:59.390
Look, I don't know how much
you want to know about any of this.

1:31:59.390 --> 1:32:01.100
You have one image of your father...

1:32:01.560 --> 1:32:03.770
...and it'd be wrong of me
to change it...

1:32:04.060 --> 1:32:05.650
...especially this late in the game.

1:32:06.060 --> 1:32:08.360
My father talked about things
he never did...

1:32:08.570 --> 1:32:12.150
...and I'm sure he did a lot of things
that he never talked about.

1:32:12.150 --> 1:32:14.030
I'm just trying to reconcile the two.

1:32:17.570 --> 1:32:20.660
The first thing
you have to understand...

1:32:21.080 --> 1:32:23.870
...is that your father
never meant to end up here.

1:32:24.580 --> 1:32:25.870
Yet he did.

1:32:26.080 --> 1:32:27.630
Twice.

1:32:28.090 --> 1:32:30.500
The first time, he was early.

1:32:31.090 --> 1:32:33.090
The second time, he was late.

1:32:35.090 --> 1:32:39.010
Those days, your father was working
for himself.

1:32:39.100 --> 1:32:42.020
If there's one thing you could
say about Edward Bloom...

1:32:42.600 --> 1:32:47.560
...it's that he was a social person,
and people took a liking to him.

1:32:47.600 --> 1:32:50.730
One night, he was returning
from three weeks on the road...

1:32:51.610 --> 1:32:54.650
...when he hit a thunderstorm
unlike any in his life.

1:34:43.220 --> 1:34:45.600
Fate has a way of circling back
on a man...

1:34:45.720 --> 1:34:47.770
...and taking him by surprise.

1:34:52.730 --> 1:34:56.400
A man sees things differently
at different times in his life.

1:34:56.400 --> 1:35:00.200
This town didn't seem the same
now that he was older.

1:35:01.740 --> 1:35:05.330
A new road had brought
the outside world to Spectre...

1:35:05.330 --> 1:35:08.330
...and with it, banks, liens and debt.

1:35:08.750 --> 1:35:13.540
Almost everywhere you looked,
people were bankrupt.

1:35:14.750 --> 1:35:18.050
The auction today
is for the town of Spectre.

1:35:18.260 --> 1:35:20.840
- The opening bid will be $ 10,000.
- So Edward Bloom...

1:35:21.260 --> 1:35:23.590
...decided to buy the town.
- 50,000.

1:35:27.760 --> 1:35:31.100
- I couldn't believe my eyes...
- He was never a wealthy man...

1:35:31.270 --> 1:35:36.400
...but he had made other men rich,
and now he asked for their favors.

1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:41.240
- I'm trying to save...
- Most of them hadn't seen Spectre.

1:35:41.780 --> 1:35:44.950
They only had Edward's words
to describe it.

1:35:44.950 --> 1:35:48.160
That's all he needed.
He sold them on the dream.

1:35:48.790 --> 1:35:51.500
So first he bought the farms.

1:35:51.500 --> 1:35:55.170
Then he bought the houses.
And then he bought the stores.

1:35:55.790 --> 1:36:00.840
Whatever he bought, the people were
not asked to leave or pay rent.

1:36:01.300 --> 1:36:04.010
They were just asked to keep
doing as they were doing.

1:36:04.300 --> 1:36:08.260
In that way, he could make sure
the town would never die.

1:36:10.810 --> 1:36:16.190
Within six months, his trust had
purchased the entire town.

1:36:16.310 --> 1:36:18.860
With one exception.

1:36:43.340 --> 1:36:46.340
You must be Edward Bloom.

1:36:46.340 --> 1:36:47.510
How do you know?

1:36:48.350 --> 1:36:50.930
No one would come out here
unless they had business.

1:36:51.350 --> 1:36:54.180
And no one would have business
with me except for you.

1:36:54.350 --> 1:36:56.600
You're buying the town.

1:36:57.860 --> 1:37:01.860
Apparently I overlooked this one
piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that.

1:37:01.860 --> 1:37:06.700
In order for the town to be preserved,
the trust must own it, in its entirety.

1:37:06.860 --> 1:37:08.320
And so I've heard.

1:37:08.370 --> 1:37:11.700
I'll offer you more than it's worth.
And you won't have to move.

1:37:11.870 --> 1:37:15.370
Nothing will change except the name
on the deed, you have my word.

1:37:15.870 --> 1:37:18.580
Now, let me get this straight.

1:37:18.580 --> 1:37:21.210
You buy the swamp from me,
but I'll stay in it?

1:37:21.380 --> 1:37:23.880
You'll own the house,
but it'll still be mine?

1:37:24.380 --> 1:37:28.220
I'll be here, and you'll come and go as
you please to one place or another.

1:37:28.390 --> 1:37:30.300
Do I have that right?

1:37:30.390 --> 1:37:32.850
In so many words, yes.

1:37:33.890 --> 1:37:35.850
Yeah, then I don't think so,
Mr. Bloom.

1:37:36.890 --> 1:37:39.860
If nothing's gonna change,
I'd just as soon it not change...

1:37:39.900 --> 1:37:42.860
...in the way things haven't been
changing all this time.

1:37:43.900 --> 1:37:48.700
It's not like you'll lose anything.
You can ask anyone in town.

1:37:50.410 --> 1:37:52.620
Why are you buying this land,
Mr. Bloom?

1:37:52.910 --> 1:37:54.490
Some sort of midlife crisis?

1:37:55.410 --> 1:37:57.870
Instead of buying a convertible,
you buy a town?

1:37:58.420 --> 1:38:00.500
Helping people makes me happy.

1:38:01.420 --> 1:38:04.510
I'm not convinced
you should be happy.

1:38:04.920 --> 1:38:08.880
- I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
- No.

1:38:08.930 --> 1:38:10.840
You did exactly what you promised.

1:38:11.430 --> 1:38:15.890
You came back.
I was just expecting you sooner.

1:38:23.440 --> 1:38:24.900
You're Beamen's daughter.

1:38:26.940 --> 1:38:29.700
Your name's different.
Did you get married?

1:38:30.450 --> 1:38:35.490
I was 18. He was 28.
Turns out that was a big difference.

1:38:44.960 --> 1:38:48.800
I won't be selling you this house,
Mr. Bloom.

1:38:49.470 --> 1:38:51.010
I see.

1:38:51.970 --> 1:38:55.390
Well, thank you for your time.

1:39:05.480 --> 1:39:08.570
- It's stuck.
- Yeah.

1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:22.040
- Oh, I'm so sorry! l...
- It's okay. Just leave it.

1:39:22.500 --> 1:39:24.840
- No, I'll...
- Please! Just go.

1:39:26.500 --> 1:39:28.800
- But...
- Go.

1:39:31.010 --> 1:39:35.800
Most men in that situation would
accept their failure and move on.

1:39:36.010 --> 1:39:38.060
But Edward was not like most men.

1:39:38.060 --> 1:39:38.560
But Edward was not like most men.

1:39:48.530 --> 1:39:49.860
Hold!

1:39:54.030 --> 1:39:56.160
They both had completely
different characters but...

1:39:57.030 --> 1:39:59.080
...well, just one pair of legs.

1:40:09.550 --> 1:40:12.970
As the months passed, he found
more and more things to fix...

1:40:13.050 --> 1:40:16.930
...until the shack no longer
resembled itself.

1:40:33.070 --> 1:40:37.280
Of course, the best part
was coming up with the new material.

1:40:38.080 --> 1:40:40.620
By the time the twins and I
had got to Havana...

1:40:40.620 --> 1:40:46.250
...we'd worked out a new routine,
using only a ukulele and a harmonica.

1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:09.060
- Well...
- You could leave it there.

1:41:26.620 --> 1:41:28.080
No.

1:41:38.640 --> 1:41:40.390
Now, don't.

1:41:41.140 --> 1:41:45.730
Don't be embarrassed. I should never
have let you think that...

1:41:47.140 --> 1:41:49.270
I'm in love with my wife.

1:41:50.150 --> 1:41:52.110
Yeah, I know.

1:41:52.650 --> 1:41:55.440
And from the first day I saw her
until the day I die...

1:41:55.650 --> 1:41:57.700
...she's the only one.

1:41:58.660 --> 1:42:01.120
Lucky girl.

1:42:01.660 --> 1:42:04.830
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.

1:42:12.170 --> 1:42:14.590
Wait! Edward.

1:42:56.210 --> 1:42:59.130
One day, Edward Bloom left...

1:42:59.220 --> 1:43:03.050
...and never returned
to the town he'd saved.

1:43:15.730 --> 1:43:17.690
As for the girl...

1:43:17.730 --> 1:43:20.240
...the common belief
was that she'd become a witch...

1:43:21.240 --> 1:43:23.030
...and crazy at that.

1:43:24.240 --> 1:43:27.740
She became something
of a legend herself.

1:43:29.250 --> 1:43:34.000
And the story ended where it began.

1:43:34.750 --> 1:43:37.800
Logically, you couldn't be
the witch, because she was...

1:43:37.800 --> 1:43:38.920
...old when he was young.

1:43:39.260 --> 1:43:42.550
Well, it's logical if you think
like your father.

1:43:43.260 --> 1:43:47.140
See, to him there's only
two women:

1:43:47.760 --> 1:43:49.220
Your mother...

1:43:49.270 --> 1:43:50.930
...and everyone else.

1:43:50.930 --> 1:43:52.640
And one day...

1:43:53.270 --> 1:43:57.610
...I realized I was in love with a man
who could never love me back.

1:43:58.280 --> 1:44:01.240
I was living in a fairy tale.

1:44:01.780 --> 1:44:04.030
I'm not sure I should've told you
any of this.

1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:06.870
No, no, no, I wanted to know. I'm...

1:44:07.280 --> 1:44:08.620
I'm glad I know.

1:44:09.290 --> 1:44:12.540
I wanted to be as important to him
as you were.

1:44:13.290 --> 1:44:15.080
And I'm...

1:44:15.290 --> 1:44:17.710
I was never gonna be.

1:44:20.300 --> 1:44:21.880
I was make-believe.

1:44:23.300 --> 1:44:28.220
And his other life, you...

1:44:28.310 --> 1:44:29.890
You were real.

1:44:54.330 --> 1:44:55.960
Mom?

1:44:56.830 --> 1:44:58.670
Josephine?

1:45:00.840 --> 1:45:02.260
Josephine?

1:45:16.350 --> 1:45:18.400
Will!

1:45:19.360 --> 1:45:20.730
What happened?

1:45:20.860 --> 1:45:22.440
Your father had a stroke.

1:45:23.360 --> 1:45:25.950
He's upstairs with your mom
and Dr. Bennett.

1:45:25.950 --> 1:45:27.110
Is he gonna be okay?

1:45:35.370 --> 1:45:37.420
I don't suppose that I could...

1:45:37.420 --> 1:45:39.920
...stay here with him.
I mean, in case...

1:45:40.880 --> 1:45:43.800
In case he wakes up,
I really ought to be here.

1:45:43.880 --> 1:45:45.090
I'll stay.

1:45:46.380 --> 1:45:49.340
Why don't you go home with
Josephine. I'll stay tonight.

1:45:51.390 --> 1:45:54.350
- Is that okay?
- Fine.

1:45:56.890 --> 1:45:59.810
Will, you'll call if there's any...?

1:46:00.400 --> 1:46:03.480
I will. I will. I'll call.

1:46:04.900 --> 1:46:08.860
- Do you want some time with Dad?
- Yes. Thank you.

1:47:12.970 --> 1:47:16.390
Glad to see you're not trying
to have a heartfelt talk.

1:47:19.480 --> 1:47:22.060
One of my greatest
annoyances is when...

1:47:22.480 --> 1:47:25.400
...people try to talk to those
who can't hear them.

1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:27.570
Well, we have an advantage.

1:47:27.990 --> 1:47:30.070
My father and I never talk.

1:47:36.990 --> 1:47:40.080
Your father ever tell you
about the day you were born?

1:47:40.080 --> 1:47:43.290
Yeah, a thousand times.
He caught an uncatchable fish.

1:47:43.500 --> 1:47:47.460
Not that. The real story.
He ever tell you that?

1:47:48.010 --> 1:47:49.630
No.

1:47:50.010 --> 1:47:53.340
Well, your mother came in about
3 in the afternoon.

1:47:53.510 --> 1:47:58.180
Her neighbor drove her, on account of
your father was away on business...

1:47:58.180 --> 1:47:59.470
...in Wichita.

1:48:00.520 --> 1:48:04.270
You were born a week early,
but there were no complications.

1:48:04.520 --> 1:48:10.240
It was a perfect delivery.
Your father was sorry not to be there.

1:48:10.530 --> 1:48:15.280
But it wasn't the custom then for men
to be in the room for deliveries...

1:48:15.530 --> 1:48:19.700
...so I can't see how it would've been
much different had he been there.

1:48:20.040 --> 1:48:22.620
And that's the real story
of how you were born.

1:48:23.540 --> 1:48:25.830
Not very exciting, is it?

1:48:26.040 --> 1:48:29.920
And I suppose if I had to choose
between the true version...

1:48:30.050 --> 1:48:34.470
...and an elaborate one involving
a fish and a wedding ring...

1:48:34.550 --> 1:48:36.510
...I might choose the fancy version.

1:48:37.550 --> 1:48:39.520
But, then that's just me.

1:48:40.560 --> 1:48:42.560
I kind of liked your version.

1:49:04.580 --> 1:49:06.210
Dad?

1:49:08.090 --> 1:49:11.550
Hey, Dad? Hey, you want me
to get the nurse?

1:49:13.590 --> 1:49:16.640
What do you want? What can I do?
What can I get?

1:49:17.090 --> 1:49:19.470
You want some water?

1:49:20.100 --> 1:49:21.520
You want a bit of water?

1:49:24.600 --> 1:49:27.350
The river.

1:49:28.610 --> 1:49:30.480
The river?

1:49:31.110 --> 1:49:35.200
Tell me how it happens.

1:49:37.110 --> 1:49:39.990
How what happens?

1:49:40.120 --> 1:49:42.450
How I go.

1:49:46.620 --> 1:49:49.170
You mean what you saw in The Eye?

1:50:03.140 --> 1:50:06.390
I don't know that story, Dad.
You never told me that one.

1:50:09.650 --> 1:50:12.650
Okay. Hey, okay, I'll try.

1:50:12.650 --> 1:50:15.280
I need your help.
Tell me how it starts.

1:50:17.650 --> 1:50:21.330
Like this.

1:50:21.660 --> 1:50:23.660
Okay. Okay.

1:50:26.160 --> 1:50:29.500
Okay, so it's in the morning...

1:50:29.670 --> 1:50:33.710
...and you and I are in the hospital,
and I've fallen asleep. And I wake up...

1:50:34.170 --> 1:50:37.470
...and I see you,
and somehow you're better.

1:50:38.180 --> 1:50:39.340
Dad?

1:50:39.340 --> 1:50:41.140
You're different.

1:50:42.180 --> 1:50:45.140
- Dad.
- Let's get out of here.

1:50:45.180 --> 1:50:46.390
Then I say:

1:50:46.680 --> 1:50:48.190
Dad, you're in no condition...

1:50:48.190 --> 1:50:50.480
Get that wheelchair.

1:50:53.190 --> 1:50:55.230
Hurry up! We haven't much time!

1:50:55.230 --> 1:50:57.490
Once we get off this floor,
we're in the clear.

1:50:57.690 --> 1:50:59.400
And we get in the wheelchair...

1:50:59.700 --> 1:51:03.160
- Faster!
...like we're escaping the hospital.

1:51:03.200 --> 1:51:05.160
What are you doing?

1:51:05.200 --> 1:51:07.410
We pass Dr. Bennett,
who tries to slow us down.

1:51:07.700 --> 1:51:10.670
- Stop them!
- We're flying down the hall.

1:51:10.710 --> 1:51:12.670
Orderly after orderly is chasing us.

1:51:13.210 --> 1:51:15.130
Mom and Josephine
are at the end.

1:51:15.210 --> 1:51:18.170
No time to explain! Stall them!

1:51:23.720 --> 1:51:25.680
We come flying out
over the curb...

1:51:25.720 --> 1:51:30.190
...and your old red Charger is there.
But it's new. Brand-new.

1:51:30.730 --> 1:51:32.980
And I pick you up...

1:51:32.980 --> 1:51:36.400
...and somehow you hardly weigh
anything. I can't explain it.

1:51:40.740 --> 1:51:43.490
Leave it! We don't need it!

1:51:45.740 --> 1:51:48.200
Water. I need water.

1:51:51.250 --> 1:51:53.210
- Where are we going?
- The river.

1:52:00.260 --> 1:52:02.630
And we have to take Glenville
to avoid traffic...

1:52:02.760 --> 1:52:05.550
...because the damn church
people drive too slow.

1:52:46.800 --> 1:52:51.980
And as we get close to the river...

1:53:00.320 --> 1:53:02.440
He's here!

1:53:02.820 --> 1:53:05.660
...we see that everybody
is already there.

1:53:22.340 --> 1:53:23.800
And I mean...

1:53:25.340 --> 1:53:26.510
...everyone.

1:53:38.860 --> 1:53:41.610
It's unbelievable.

1:53:42.360 --> 1:53:47.110
The story of my life.

1:53:54.870 --> 1:53:57.790
The strange thing is, there's
not a sad face to be found.

1:53:57.880 --> 1:54:00.460
Everyone is just so glad
to see you...

1:54:01.880 --> 1:54:04.090
...and send you off right.

1:54:04.090 --> 1:54:09.510
Goodbye, everybody!
Farewell! Adieu!

1:54:20.900 --> 1:54:23.480
My girl in the river.

1:55:34.970 --> 1:55:37.810
You become what you always were.

1:55:39.480 --> 1:55:41.770
A very big fish.

1:55:46.980 --> 1:55:49.400
And that's how it happens.

1:55:50.990 --> 1:55:52.780
Yeah.

1:55:55.490 --> 1:55:57.660
Exactly.

1:56:40.040 --> 1:56:41.750
Mom?

1:58:08.630 --> 1:58:11.800
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not be in want.

1:58:12.130 --> 1:58:15.880
He makes me to lie down
in green pastures.

1:58:15.880 --> 1:58:18.550
He leads me beside the quiet waters.

1:58:18.640 --> 1:58:20.600
He restores my soul.

1:58:21.140 --> 1:58:25.100
He guides me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

1:58:25.640 --> 1:58:28.810
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

1:58:29.150 --> 1:58:31.820
...I will fear no evil,
for you are with me.

1:58:31.820 --> 1:58:35.900
Surely goodness and love will
follow me all the days of my life.

1:59:23.200 --> 1:59:27.830
Have you ever heard a joke so many
times you've forgotten why it's funny?

1:59:27.830 --> 1:59:31.710
And then you hear it again
and suddenly it's new.

1:59:32.210 --> 1:59:35.300
You remember why you loved it
in the first place.

1:59:37.210 --> 1:59:40.300
So he said he'll fight the giant
who was 15 feet tall!

1:59:40.300 --> 1:59:43.680
- No way!
- Dad! That's right, isn't it?

1:59:44.220 --> 1:59:45.470
Pretty much.

1:59:45.720 --> 1:59:47.850
See? So he was a giant.

1:59:47.850 --> 1:59:50.100
That was my father's final joke,
I guess.

1:59:50.730 --> 1:59:56.480
A man tells his stories so many times
that he becomes the stories.

1:59:57.730 --> 1:59:59.990
They live on after him.

2:00:02.740 --> 2:00:05.990
And in that way,
he becomes immortal.

2:00:17.990 --> 2:00:28.990
