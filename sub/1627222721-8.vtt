00:01.001 --> 00:03.420
<i>I'm escalating this to a threat
level zeta, possibly epsilon.</i>

00:03.420 --> 00:05.755
I'm not familiar with your threat levels.

00:05.755 --> 00:08.174
<i>Curtain's organization
is expanding rapidly.</i>

00:08.174 --> 00:10.218
<i>And more people have fallen
into waking comae.</i>

00:10.218 --> 00:13.138
<i>Apparently, all of them
had complained of stiff necks.</i>

00:13.138 --> 00:15.348
There's a small chance
this is a repercussion of the program.

00:15.348 --> 00:18.435
- <i>Why is Constance... smiling?</i>
- <i>Curtain did it.</i>

00:18.435 --> 00:20.228
She was acting suspiciously nice to me.

00:20.228 --> 00:21.771
<i>We just want them to be themselves.</i>

00:21.771 --> 00:23.231
<i>Garrison's notebook?</i>

00:23.231 --> 00:25.734
<i>If anyone knows how to reverse this,
it's her.</i>

00:25.734 --> 00:27.027
<i>I call it the Wetherall Worldview Wash.</i>

00:27.027 --> 00:29.195
<i>Could shock the photoreceptors in the eye.</i>

00:29.195 --> 00:31.948
- It can jar the brain into resetting.
- Turn the knob.

00:32.991 --> 00:34.534
<i>He didn't turn the knob in time.</i>

00:35.201 --> 00:37.287
We have to remove Curtain immediately.

00:38.455 --> 00:42.292
<i>It's a healthy dose of duskwort.
It should last for hours.</i>

00:43.001 --> 00:45.587
<i>Good. Because we have
a long drive ahead of us.</i>

00:55.930 --> 00:58.975
- There.
- What? Can you be more specific?

00:58.975 --> 01:00.351
Bear left at the Hand Tree.

01:00.351 --> 01:02.645
- The what?
- The tree that looks like a hand?

01:02.645 --> 01:04.606
The Hand Tree. Milligan, left, left!

01:10.570 --> 01:13.656
Sorry. I'm having feelings.

01:23.792 --> 01:27.003
- Oh, this is the safe house?
- Potentially.

01:44.687 --> 01:46.731
Well, well, well.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.818
Well, well, well, well... Well.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.528
Hello, Mother.

01:51.528 --> 01:54.906
Mother? Oh, my.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.241
- This is delightful.
- This is delightful.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.827
Hello, Number.

01:59.410 --> 02:02.038
- Number?
- Number's her first name.

02:03.331 --> 02:05.750
I'm glad I can still recognize you.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.878
Mom has been really brave
about your abandonment.

02:09.420 --> 02:10.547
Really brave.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.133
Everyone, meet my family.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.760
My mother, Rowena.

02:15.760 --> 02:18.138
- My sister, Charity...
- Hello.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.681
And my brother...

02:21.975 --> 02:25.895
My sister, Charity, and Madame Chops.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.107
I'm pleased to meet you both.

02:29.107 --> 02:32.652
And my brother... One.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.279
One? Two?

02:34.779 --> 02:38.074
So why have you come crawling back?

02:38.575 --> 02:39.826
What do you need?

02:39.826 --> 02:41.744
We need your...

02:43.746 --> 02:44.873
...your help.

02:49.669 --> 02:53.506
Make sure the other cars don't lose us.
It's going to get treacherous.

02:53.506 --> 02:54.924
- Approved.
- Yes, do that.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.634
That's unnecessary.

02:56.634 --> 02:58.720
I have authority as interim director to...

02:58.720 --> 03:00.680
- Self-appointed.
- Not official.

03:01.055 --> 03:02.724
Keep driving, Erika.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.351
Approved.

03:05.351 --> 03:08.479
You have absconded with a mastermind?

03:08.479 --> 03:10.440
An evil mastermind, yes.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.400
And you brought them to our house?

03:12.400 --> 03:14.277
- Can we see him?
- Or her.

03:14.944 --> 03:19.490
Actually, he is my brother and I do think
evil is a bit overexuberant.

03:19.490 --> 03:23.536
But allow me to say that I think
you should be very proud of Number Two.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.414
She is one of the finest human beings
I have ever known.

03:26.414 --> 03:27.999
- She's wonderful.
- Indeed.

03:27.999 --> 03:31.544
It's a relief to hear that my sister
has finally sustained some friendships.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.713
- One!
- I was being sincere.

03:33.713 --> 03:36.049
He was being nice to you.
Don't jump down his throat.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.927
- Of course, you'd take his side.
- Here we go again.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.720
- She named you "One."
- Yes.

03:40.720 --> 03:44.974
- You're the youngest!
- It had a nice ring. A nice ring.

03:47.602 --> 03:51.981
We need a place to stay. A safe house.
We're being hunted.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.108
Convenient.

03:55.818 --> 03:59.030
- So, this is family life?
- Looks like it.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.449
We have to rebuild the Worldview Wash.

04:01.449 --> 04:05.787
Who knows how long Constance
and Mr. Benedict have before they go dark.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.998
We need components, power tools.

04:09.707 --> 04:11.417
- We have tools.
- Oh, my God.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.919
Components too.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.880
Your attention, please.

04:16.506 --> 04:20.260
I have decided that you can stay.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.344
Oh.

04:21.344 --> 04:24.555
But you will have to work for your supper.

04:24.555 --> 04:28.226
We're very far behind on the additions.

04:28.810 --> 04:32.021
This house already
has 17 bedrooms, Mother.

04:32.021 --> 04:34.607
We quarry our own rock.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.819
It's time-consuming but fulfilling.

04:37.819 --> 04:41.990
I am gaining so much understanding.

04:42.907 --> 04:45.618
- We need to get Curtain out of the truck.
- Uh-huh.

04:58.548 --> 05:02.010
It's so fun to see you all run around.
So busy.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.512
We could use some help. This is for you.

05:04.512 --> 05:06.764
Oh, don't do it on my account.

05:06.764 --> 05:09.684
You might be just hours
from going comatose.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.019
I feel amazing.

05:12.770 --> 05:14.397
I need a better lens.

05:14.981 --> 05:19.569
Things that reflect, refract, and relay,
are in that cabinet.

05:19.569 --> 05:23.990
Here, things that connect,
confound, and contour.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.366
Over there are...

05:27.493 --> 05:28.453
nails.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.708
What happens when Curtain wakes up?

05:33.708 --> 05:36.377
Mr. Benedict is convinced
he can reach him.

05:36.377 --> 05:39.172
Of course, he's going to say that.
He's happy.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.257
It didn't work last time.

05:41.257 --> 05:44.886
I don't see how talking to Dr. Curtain
is going to stop him.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.554
And we need to stop him.

05:46.554 --> 05:48.056
He's the bad guy.

05:48.056 --> 05:51.059
- But Mr. Benedict wants to...
- To save him.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.143
Yeah.

05:53.353 --> 05:57.607
Maybe we need to save the bad guy
if we can.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.902
Maybe that's the only way to really win.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.047
How are you feeling?

06:24.092 --> 06:25.468
Yeah, I'm...

06:28.596 --> 06:29.639
Inspired.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.599
And betrayed.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.267
What?

06:35.061 --> 06:37.355
You drugged me? Knocked me out?

06:37.355 --> 06:38.648
Blowdart.

06:38.648 --> 06:42.235
Oh, how crude. That's beneath you.

06:42.235 --> 06:45.196
I felt I had to get you out of there.

06:45.196 --> 06:48.366
Away from the acolytes and the yes men.

06:48.366 --> 06:49.992
Nathaniel, what you're doing...

06:49.992 --> 06:52.370
Is helping people. It helped you.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.038
No, it's artificial.

06:54.539 --> 06:59.377
And, and yes, it does feel so good,
but it's not helping anyone.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.170
In fact, it's quite harmful.

07:01.170 --> 07:04.298
People are going blank,
they're going catatonic.

07:04.298 --> 07:06.843
There's no concrete evidence
that my system is causing...

07:06.843 --> 07:10.888
I saw it. And I know you saw it, too.
You're in denial.

07:11.597 --> 07:13.808
You're not thinking about anyone.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.977
It's still about control for you.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.396
Oh, please. You don't know me
as well as you think you do.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.773
Oh, well, I thought I did,
but maybe I was wrong.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.109
Either way,
I can't let you do this any longer.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.528
Oh, you don't have a choice.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.864
My people are already on their way.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.700
Well, they'll never find us.
We are far off the grid.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.370
We're ten miles from the French border
in southwestern Luxembourg.

07:36.205 --> 07:37.832
You think I didn't do my homework,

07:37.832 --> 07:40.960
that I didn't anticipate every move
you might make?

07:41.919 --> 07:43.713
That's more, like, 12 miles.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.215
So, they'll be five minutes later.

07:49.802 --> 07:52.054
- What's that?
- What?

07:52.638 --> 07:54.515
- Your neck, what's wrong?
- Oh, nothing.

07:54.515 --> 07:55.892
Your people tackled me, so...

07:55.892 --> 07:59.020
- How long has it been like that?
- A few days. What does it matter?

07:59.020 --> 08:02.523
- Stop trying to change the subject.
- This is the subject. I'm just asking you.

08:02.523 --> 08:04.317
How long has it been like that?

08:06.194 --> 08:07.278
Nicholas.

08:12.825 --> 08:13.784
Nicholas?

09:24.689 --> 09:27.149
You seem to have found an agreeable group.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.195
Have you adopted any of those children?

09:31.946 --> 09:33.030
I have not.

09:33.197 --> 09:34.448
They seem nice.

09:35.074 --> 09:35.908
Orphans?

09:36.993 --> 09:43.040
I sense an orphan's appreciation
of what it means to have a loving home.

09:46.168 --> 09:52.258
I've often wondered how you were managing
in the chaotic nightmare of... out there.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.051
It's not that chaotic.

09:54.051 --> 09:57.513
Well, in normal times.
Right now, it's pretty chaotic.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.099
It would have been nice to hear from you.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.560
Well, you never pick up the phone, ever.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.353
I find it a nuisance.

10:04.353 --> 10:09.442
Anyway, no time to catch up, really.
Work to do.

10:10.568 --> 10:11.777
Hm.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.571
This is nice.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.823
Been saving it for you.

10:17.241 --> 10:18.451
Thank you.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.036
Balance is off for me.

10:20.036 --> 10:24.123
Thought it might play better
with your weird swinging pattern.

10:24.790 --> 10:25.833
Thank you.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.753
And by the way, I sent letters.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.254
You could have written back.

10:30.254 --> 10:33.841
I'm not going to sleuth out
my own daughter's address.

10:33.841 --> 10:35.968
It's right there on the envelope.

10:35.968 --> 10:39.263
Some of us are happy right where we are.

10:40.723 --> 10:43.267
But not all of us.

10:49.565 --> 10:52.401
And you never wanna leave? Ever?

10:52.401 --> 10:55.112
There's too much to do here.

10:55.112 --> 11:00.284
And though I know you believe it,
different does not equal better.

11:00.284 --> 11:03.037
It's perfectly normal
to want to see the world.

11:03.037 --> 11:04.455
To meet new people.

11:05.039 --> 11:08.751
New people. Terrible priorities.

11:09.585 --> 11:11.879
I suppose the correct priority would be
to build yourself

11:11.879 --> 11:14.715
a prison of spare bedrooms.

11:18.552 --> 11:22.515
May I offer an observation?

11:22.515 --> 11:24.684
You mean Mind Tricks?

11:25.559 --> 11:28.354
If given a decade,
I think I can solve this.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.649
But I have to make defensive preparations.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.151
Do you have a map of the property?

11:34.151 --> 11:36.320
Of course, I have a detailed map
of the property.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.699
It's in the foyer, framed.
You can take it down.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.158
One can show you.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.410
No problem.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.286
One,

11:44.286 --> 11:47.832
do you find this lifestyle stifling?

11:47.832 --> 11:48.958
No!

11:50.209 --> 11:52.002
I was just on the ham radio.

11:52.002 --> 11:55.715
Great way to stay in touch
while staying right here.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.717
World at your fingertips.

11:57.717 --> 12:01.095
Anyway, old Vandenpuig
said the funniest thing.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.597
There are people in town asking about us.

12:04.181 --> 12:05.558
More new people?

12:05.558 --> 12:06.475
Grey people.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.769
We've been found.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.355
Milligan!

12:17.111 --> 12:19.113
Nicholas?

12:20.322 --> 12:23.242
I need you to wake up.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.202
Wake up!

12:29.206 --> 12:31.459
I know it looks messy right now,
but we're trying to...

12:31.459 --> 12:34.712
- No time. The greys are coming.
- Okay. The property is defensible.

12:34.712 --> 12:37.590
I have many ideas,
but we will need everyone.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.049
- Got it.
- Okay.

12:39.049 --> 12:40.801
Why must we have conflict?

12:41.177 --> 12:43.137
Okay. Everyone, except perhaps Constance.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.639
We could really use her mind power
about now.

12:45.639 --> 12:47.308
- We're about to be attacked.
- Kate.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.560
It's not something I can choose to do.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.354
It just happens
and I'm completely fine with that.

12:52.354 --> 12:55.024
Sticky, Reynie, Kate, Dipika.
We have work to do.

12:55.024 --> 12:58.360
Constance, go back into the main house
for your own safety.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.112
Maybe I'd rather take a walk.

13:00.112 --> 13:04.033
There's a lovely 2,000-piece
jigsaw puzzle inside.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.243
Oh, intriguing.

13:36.816 --> 13:37.817
Please.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.196
Please, I don't know what to do.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.741
You have to come back.

13:48.494 --> 13:51.914
You were right.
This is about control, it always has been.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.000
And yes, I did know it was wrong.

13:55.793 --> 13:58.170
But somehow I thought
if I convinced you that it was good,

13:58.170 --> 13:59.839
then you would think I was good.

14:00.297 --> 14:03.175
You have to come back.

14:03.175 --> 14:05.469
You have to fix this, fix us.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.304
You have to make things right.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.100
I love you, Nicholas.

14:12.893 --> 14:15.020
Oh, I wish we could have
gotten here sooner.

14:26.156 --> 14:27.449
You were faking it?

14:31.412 --> 14:32.830
<i>♪ Oh, Momma ♪</i>

16:06.799 --> 16:07.716
Why?

16:07.716 --> 16:10.219
I knew the only way to get through to you
is if you thought you lost me.

16:12.638 --> 16:13.639
How?

16:14.348 --> 16:18.519
The children, they, uh, fashioned
a device to reverse the happiness.

16:18.519 --> 16:21.146
<i>And before it was broken,
the device actually worked on me.</i>

16:21.146 --> 16:22.940
It's a fact I chose to hide.

16:22.940 --> 16:26.026
A devious plan. I have to respect it.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.737
But it changes nothing.

16:29.488 --> 16:31.699
- I don't believe you.
- You don't?

16:31.699 --> 16:36.578
Even if you don't admit it,
what you felt a moment ago, that was real.

16:37.287 --> 16:40.207
More real than anything you could create.

16:40.833 --> 16:44.878
And whether it was happiness or sadness
or anything in between,

16:44.878 --> 16:46.880
it was true emotion.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.549
And it's essential.

16:48.549 --> 16:51.427
It's what I finally can feel
standing in front of you.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.429
A swirl of emotions, good or bad,

16:53.429 --> 16:57.266
and it is more valuable to me than gold.

16:59.727 --> 17:00.978
And I'm sorry.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.022
For what?

17:03.022 --> 17:06.275
The blowdart. I know it hurt.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.249
They're here.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.358
This is my daughter!

17:48.567 --> 17:52.029
- And while she is not perfect...
- Not relevant.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.572
...neither am I!

17:53.572 --> 17:55.908
It's a two-way street!

17:55.908 --> 17:58.368
Perfectly said, my beautiful son.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.705
Back off.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.791
This is my home.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.469
Stop.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.096
Stand down.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.434
Stand down, all of you.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.854
- What?
- I don't understand.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.940
We're here to save you, sir.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.942
No, you can't save me.
I've already been saved.

18:31.902 --> 18:33.362
By my brother.

18:36.573 --> 18:39.701
- Sir?
- Yes, he helped me see that I...

18:39.701 --> 18:41.703
possibly have been approaching things
the wrong way.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.664
And if you told me I would never say
something like that,

18:43.664 --> 18:45.415
well, I would never say something
like that, but here we are.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.754
Now, you're free to go
to find your own path.

18:50.754 --> 18:52.005
That doesn't make any sense.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.258
It has to be some sort of code.

18:54.258 --> 18:57.136
- Is he blinking in code?
- I think I see him blinking in code.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.388
You're released from service.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.932
- Are you saying don't believe you?
- I'm not.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.476
No, I'm... Stop.

19:06.311 --> 19:07.354
Jackson.

19:10.941 --> 19:12.317
The door is open.

19:12.317 --> 19:15.737
Please, discover who you are.

19:16.280 --> 19:19.074
I urge you to find your own happiness.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.826
It's what we all deserve.

19:22.161 --> 19:25.998
I, I...

19:27.166 --> 19:28.417
- I...
- I...

19:28.417 --> 19:30.919
- Uh, I, I, I, uh...
- I, I, I...

19:30.919 --> 19:32.754
- I, uh...
- I, I...

19:35.340 --> 19:38.552
- Your philosophy will live on!
- Even without you!

19:38.552 --> 19:39.928
Don't want it to.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.518
I...

19:50.856 --> 19:53.066
I'm just not clever with words.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.949
I'll go check on Constance.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.455
Well, what can I do?

20:06.455 --> 20:08.040
Are you handy?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.541
I don't understand the question.

20:09.541 --> 20:10.834
Grab a hammer.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.003
It's ready.

20:14.421 --> 20:16.965
Mr. Benedict! Number Two!

20:26.141 --> 20:27.935
This is how I found her.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.104
I'm responsible for this.

20:31.104 --> 20:32.648
So I'll fix it.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.066
No.

20:35.359 --> 20:36.818
We both will.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.830
Come on, please.
There has to be a solution.

20:49.706 --> 20:51.541
Are we sure about the light box?

20:51.541 --> 20:54.002
Yes, my doctor tried something similar.

20:54.002 --> 20:57.172
It only works
before they become like this.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.467
However, what if we insert an electrode

21:00.467 --> 21:02.469
into the right hemisphere
of the frontal lobe...

21:02.469 --> 21:05.180
She would lose all function
in her left side.

21:05.889 --> 21:07.307
Well, there are worse things.

21:07.307 --> 21:08.475
Well...

21:08.725 --> 21:10.227
I know. I know.

21:10.978 --> 21:13.105
But this was ultimately
a mechanical process,

21:13.105 --> 21:14.481
there has to be a similar fix.

21:16.316 --> 21:18.318
- What if there isn't?
- Oh, well, that's helpful.

21:18.318 --> 21:22.072
What I mean is,
what if the fix is emotional?

21:22.072 --> 21:23.448
Oh, skeptical.

21:23.448 --> 21:26.702
Your process triggers
an artificial happiness, yes?

21:27.869 --> 21:29.246
What happens to the real happiness?

21:29.371 --> 21:30.956
- The real joy?
- Nothing?

21:30.956 --> 21:34.042
Exactly. It's buried, tamped down.

21:34.042 --> 21:36.420
Unprocessed to the point
where it fries the pathway

21:36.420 --> 21:39.631
and leaves you unable to feel anything.

21:39.631 --> 21:44.553
I propose we attempt
to rebuild that pathway.

21:45.304 --> 21:48.515
That road back to happiness.

21:48.974 --> 21:50.225
How?

21:52.602 --> 21:53.478
So...

21:54.438 --> 21:55.480
what do we do?

21:55.480 --> 22:00.110
We're trying to restore Constance's
ability to feel happiness.

22:00.694 --> 22:01.987
Or anything.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.740
And as the people she cares most about
in this world,

22:05.449 --> 22:08.702
I think you three are
in the best position to help.

22:08.702 --> 22:12.706
Returning to my original question.
What do we do?

22:12.706 --> 22:15.000
Just be yourselves. Talk to her.

22:15.834 --> 22:18.545
You are the ones who make her happy.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.505
- We do?
- Yes.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.344
Um, hey, Constance.
I assume you can hear us, right?

22:25.344 --> 22:28.347
I mean, look,
you're not always the nicest person...

22:28.347 --> 22:29.681
- Kate.
- What are you doing?

22:29.681 --> 22:31.266
I'm getting to my point.

22:31.850 --> 22:35.520
Which is that despite
the relentless crabbiness,

22:35.520 --> 22:37.939
we actually all love
spending time with you.

22:41.068 --> 22:42.235
Next.

22:44.863 --> 22:49.117
Remember that time you broke
The Whisperer with your brain?

22:49.659 --> 22:52.996
That was fun, right? Good times.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.540
So, um...

22:56.458 --> 22:59.586
let's make more memories.

22:59.586 --> 23:02.714
Friendship? Laughter? Fun?

23:03.256 --> 23:05.217
You're just listing pleasant words.

23:05.217 --> 23:11.515
Constance, we really want you back.
Please. We love you.

23:15.310 --> 23:16.937
We're not making her happy.

23:16.937 --> 23:18.730
We're annoying her.

23:19.815 --> 23:20.982
Maybe that's it.

23:22.275 --> 23:24.403
What does Constance like to do
more than anything?

23:25.028 --> 23:26.988
- Insult us?
- Exactly.

23:27.447 --> 23:29.032
It's what makes her happy.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.700
It's how she shows love.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.578
Unconventional, but true.

23:33.578 --> 23:35.622
So let's get her to insult us.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.084
- She can't talk.
- Not right now.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.128
But what if we make it irresistible?

23:41.586 --> 23:45.090
- If I were to say, how much I like hugs...
- Ugh.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.008
...how long do you think she could resist?

23:47.008 --> 23:49.052
It goes against her biology.

23:49.761 --> 23:50.846
Constance.

23:50.846 --> 23:53.849
I love hugging. I love it.

23:59.104 --> 24:02.566
Have you seen the livery
on the new German maglev trains?

24:02.566 --> 24:05.110
Blue vertical stripes. I'm freaking out.

24:09.990 --> 24:12.242
You know what the great thing
about my bucket is?

24:12.242 --> 24:16.455
It's that it's not tied
to any emotional need.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.666
It's just a totally logical way
of being prepared.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.296
- Go, go, go.
- Hey, Kate,

24:24.296 --> 24:26.590
who's your favorite rhyming poet?

24:26.590 --> 24:28.967
Do I have to pick just one?

24:28.967 --> 24:30.385
They're all great.

24:32.512 --> 24:34.473
<i>The woods are lovely, dark, and deep.</i>

24:34.473 --> 24:38.310
<i>But I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep.</i>

24:38.310 --> 24:41.897
<i>Success is counted sweetest
by those who ne'er succeed.</i>

24:41.897 --> 24:46.067
<i>To comprehend a nectar
requires the sorest need.</i>

24:46.067 --> 24:49.029
<i>Do not go gentle into that good night.</i>

24:49.029 --> 24:51.865
<i>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</i>

24:51.865 --> 24:56.203
"Whan that Aprille with his shoures soote.

24:56.786 --> 25:01.875
The droghte of Marc
hath perced to the roote."

25:02.501 --> 25:04.961
You know what I love in this world
more than anything?

25:04.961 --> 25:06.588
More than hugging?

25:07.130 --> 25:12.010
I love a big, bright, sumptuous...

25:12.636 --> 25:14.221
sweater vest.

25:17.599 --> 25:20.477
I'd rather be in a coma
than listen to this.

25:21.436 --> 25:23.063
She's back.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.397
Constance!

25:25.065 --> 25:27.067
- Oh, god.
- No, no.

25:27.067 --> 25:29.110
No hugging. No hugging.

25:29.110 --> 25:30.362
No...

25:45.168 --> 25:47.504
Thank you for helping us.

25:47.504 --> 25:51.633
Thank you for saying goodbye
before abandoning us again.

25:52.467 --> 25:54.636
Is it abandonment if you say goodbye?

25:55.303 --> 25:56.429
How about this?

25:56.429 --> 25:58.598
You all come visit me in Stonetown.

25:58.598 --> 26:00.475
I'd love to show you my other home.

26:00.850 --> 26:03.353
- Maybe leave Madame Chops here.
- Nope.

26:03.353 --> 26:05.105
Maybe a protective sleeve?

26:06.481 --> 26:07.482
We'll see.

26:09.276 --> 26:11.444
Oh, hello.

26:12.070 --> 26:12.904
Hello.

26:14.447 --> 26:16.116
Well...

26:16.575 --> 26:18.285
Back to the compound?

26:18.285 --> 26:19.494
Oh, yes.

26:20.078 --> 26:23.665
Between this and what you figured out
with Constance, we...

26:23.665 --> 26:26.459
we have the template to unwind this, so...

26:27.544 --> 26:28.878
I need to get to work.

26:29.337 --> 26:30.755
It's good to have you back.

26:31.464 --> 26:33.216
Yes.

26:36.761 --> 26:37.762
Yeah.

27:00.452 --> 27:05.373
Well, I think I lost a bit
of perspective on this one.

27:05.373 --> 27:07.125
Happens to the best of us.

27:07.125 --> 27:11.546
Still, this organization needs
more than just one perspective.

27:11.838 --> 27:13.214
So if you're willing,

27:13.214 --> 27:15.634
I'd like the two of you to step
into a leadership role.

27:17.761 --> 27:19.137
We'd love to.

27:19.679 --> 27:23.099
- Oh, in about five weeks.
- What?

27:24.601 --> 27:25.644
Five.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.937
Is this something
that I'm not invited to, or...

27:27.937 --> 27:29.022
- No.
- No?

27:32.192 --> 27:33.026
Kate.

27:34.277 --> 27:37.364
You'll be delighted to hear that
I am not going to ask

27:37.364 --> 27:39.157
if you need a jacket.

27:39.157 --> 27:40.784
I appreciate that,

27:40.784 --> 27:44.204
but I really don't mind
if you do sometimes.

27:46.206 --> 27:47.832
Let's go see Madge.

27:50.835 --> 27:53.630
Okay. I was a little needy.

27:54.422 --> 27:55.632
None of this is easy.

27:56.883 --> 27:59.761
I want you to know I'm really glad
you found your place at Boatwright.

28:00.970 --> 28:02.597
I've got two places.

28:10.438 --> 28:13.066
Come, come. That's it.

28:30.041 --> 28:34.337
<i>♪ I love, I love
I'm ready to love, yeah ♪</i>

28:35.380 --> 28:37.507
