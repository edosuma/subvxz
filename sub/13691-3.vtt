Too London.

00:16.513 --> 00:18.390
Toot, toot!

00:18.474 --> 00:20.059
Have you told him yet?

00:20.142 --> 00:22.936
Old H has got everything
under control, dear.

00:23.020 --> 00:26.023
-That's exactly
what's worrying me.
-Toot!

00:32.154 --> 00:34.073
-Too Hector.
-What?

00:41.121 --> 00:43.665
MOLLY: You haven't, have you?
HECTOR: What?

00:43.749 --> 00:45.250
Have you?

00:45.334 --> 00:49.421
(IMITATING PA)
Train now approaching
Doncaster station...

00:49.505 --> 00:50.923
Have you?

00:51.006 --> 00:54.134
Molly, please!
That train was just
going into the station!

01:07.980 --> 01:10.109
Well.

01:15.823 --> 01:17.282
There now.

01:18.826 --> 01:21.328
Aren't we the dog's whatsits?

01:21.412 --> 01:24.873
-Think it'll do?
-Archie, son...

01:24.957 --> 01:27.251
in that suit, with that look,

01:27.334 --> 01:30.920
you could sell Sunday trading
to a kirk full of
wee free ministers.

01:38.554 --> 01:40.639
-Your papers.
-Thank you.

01:40.723 --> 01:43.350
-Plans.
-Mother, please!

01:43.433 --> 01:44.893
Hold still.

01:44.977 --> 01:47.229
Your father has
something to say to you.
Haven't you, Hector?

01:47.311 --> 01:50.232
Oh, yes. Archie, Archie...

01:53.444 --> 01:55.446
Give them hell.
Knock 'em dead.

01:56.905 --> 02:00.200
Thanks. Thanks, everyone.

02:02.745 --> 02:04.830
Well?

02:04.913 --> 02:07.374
I told him I'd
tell him tomorrow.

02:50.167 --> 02:51.835
(OWL HOOTING)

02:51.919 --> 02:54.671
She was shot by
a gamekeeper a while ago.

02:54.755 --> 02:57.674
So now we have to look
after her because she can't
survive on her own.

02:57.758 --> 03:00.135
GIRL:
Are you going to keep her?

03:00.219 --> 03:03.972
Only until she's better.
Because wild things
belong in the wild.

03:04.932 --> 03:06.934
What does she eat, worms?

03:07.017 --> 03:09.061
No, bigger than worms.
She eats mice...

03:09.144 --> 03:10.521
(OWL HOOTING)

03:10.604 --> 03:12.856
Excuse me, who's giving
this lesson, you or me?

03:12.940 --> 03:15.317
She eats mice and shrews
and little animals like that.

03:15.401 --> 03:18.862
ALL: Ew!
GIRL: That's cruel!

03:18.946 --> 03:20.656
Well, that's life, I'm afraid.

03:20.739 --> 03:25.202
The strong devour the weak,
the old get
consumed by the new.

03:25.285 --> 03:27.204
It's called natural selection.

03:37.840 --> 03:42.970
Tea. You've no need to
go chucking the baby out
with the bath water.

03:43.053 --> 03:44.638
Fergal only
needs a small patch.

03:44.722 --> 03:48.559
I have to make
a proper space for boy wonder.
Archie's orders.

03:48.642 --> 03:53.105
-Well, why don't you
let me look after it?
-No, Lexie, just leave it.

03:53.188 --> 03:55.357
I have to clear
this space out anyway.

03:55.441 --> 03:59.570
No point in hanging onto
things when you haven't got
a use for them, is there?

04:23.260 --> 04:26.764
Sorry I'm late, Archie.
I got held up at school.

04:26.847 --> 04:28.265
You do too much
for those kids.

04:28.348 --> 04:32.311
-It wasn't me. It was Fergal.
-Oh.

04:32.394 --> 04:36.732
He was showing them his owl.
They wouldn't let him leave.

04:36.815 --> 04:39.651
-He really is quite something.
-I know.

04:39.735 --> 04:41.153
He's a great find.

04:41.236 --> 04:45.157
Now, have you met
our chair Edith Rankin?

04:45.240 --> 04:47.618
No,
I've never had the pleasure.

04:47.701 --> 04:50.287
Well,
you're in for a treat, then.

04:50.371 --> 04:54.208
The committee goes through
all the new grant
applications one by one.

04:54.291 --> 04:58.837
You come in and make
your pitch, then you leave
and we decide, okay?

04:58.921 --> 05:00.089
Fine.

05:02.341 --> 05:05.344
Archie, the project is sound.

05:05.427 --> 05:08.389
You shouldn't have
anything to worry about.

05:10.516 --> 05:11.850
All right.

05:25.197 --> 05:26.782
(CAR APPROACHING)

05:30.869 --> 05:33.497
FERGAL: Right,
let's get this bird out.

05:33.580 --> 05:35.958
Let's have a look at her,
see if she
survived the journey.

05:36.041 --> 05:38.627
We'll get her aviary finished
and get her a decent fly-out.

05:38.711 --> 05:41.088
-Can I hold her?
-Of course you can, yeah.

05:41.171 --> 05:44.591
Put on the gauntlet.
All yours.

05:45.676 --> 05:47.469
See this, Lexie?

05:47.552 --> 05:49.972
Best looking
bird on the estate.

05:50.055 --> 05:52.558
Just watch she doesn't
mistake you for lunch.

05:52.641 --> 05:55.728
I hear she's partial
to a wee chipolata.

05:55.811 --> 06:00.774
Duncan, can you give us a hand
to get that place cleaned up?

06:00.858 --> 06:03.610
I'm finishing
the aviary with Fergal.

06:03.694 --> 06:06.113
No, no, that's all right,
Duncan, give Golly a hand.

06:06.196 --> 06:08.115
It's not gonna
take long, is it?

06:08.198 --> 06:09.825
Couple of hours
I should think.

06:09.908 --> 06:12.953
-Grand. No problem.
-Good.

06:13.037 --> 06:15.372
It's okay, here.

06:15.456 --> 06:20.711
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the Glenbogle
Adventure Centre.

06:20.794 --> 06:23.630
A nature walk through
a Caledonian pine forest,

06:23.714 --> 06:25.758
a cycle ride around the loch,

06:25.841 --> 06:29.553
boating, a visit to
our Wildlife Rescue Unit,

06:29.636 --> 06:32.723
finishing up with a cup of tea
at the Visitor's Centre Cafe.

06:32.806 --> 06:35.684
-Now, all of these things...
-EDITH: How much?

06:35.768 --> 06:38.312
-I'm sorry?
-How much do you want?

06:38.395 --> 06:41.356
Um, Â£8,000.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.734
Thank you, Mr MacDonald.

06:46.111 --> 06:48.197
That's all for now.

06:50.824 --> 06:53.077
Oh. Thank you.

06:58.415 --> 07:01.835
Um...on a personal note,

07:01.919 --> 07:05.506
I have spent the last six
months working on this
plan for Glenbogle.

07:05.589 --> 07:09.009
It's my...my
vision for the future.

07:09.093 --> 07:14.014
This grant will help us create
a resource that we can all
be proud of for years to come.

07:15.974 --> 07:18.102
It's... It's in your hands.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.480
Thank you, Mr MacDonald.

07:21.563 --> 07:23.816
If you'll just wait outside.

07:25.359 --> 07:26.735
Right.

07:33.826 --> 07:35.577
(DOOR CLOSES)

07:38.622 --> 07:46.046
A remarkable young man.
Well-presented scheme.
Forward-looking.

07:46.130 --> 07:52.553
And it's
certainly very ambitious.
Quite remarkable...

07:52.636 --> 07:56.223
that he has the nerve
to come
cap-in-hand to ask for money

07:56.306 --> 08:00.060
to line his own pockets
when he owns half the county.

08:00.144 --> 08:04.189
With respect,
this scheme won't
just help the estate.

08:04.273 --> 08:06.400
It'll bring more
visitors to the area,

08:06.483 --> 08:09.653
which will benefit every
business from the petrol
station to the newsagent.

08:09.737 --> 08:13.198
Are you forgetting there's
hardly room to park in
the village as it is?

08:13.282 --> 08:16.827
We'll end up engulfed by
theme-park seeking tourists.

08:16.910 --> 08:19.413
But we need more tourists.

08:19.496 --> 08:24.209
We don't need half our annual
budget spent creating
a Scottish Disneyland.

08:25.878 --> 08:27.963
Well,
what'll you spend on, then?

08:28.047 --> 08:31.300
Naff pottery shops
and shortbread tins.

08:32.176 --> 08:34.135
We'll go to the vote.

08:35.763 --> 08:39.058
All those in
favour of rejection?

08:46.523 --> 08:53.154
-Miss Finlay?
-No. I'll not vote.

08:53.238 --> 08:57.325
And I'll bring it up
at the full council
meeting on Monday.

08:57.409 --> 08:59.495
Miss Finlay...

08:59.578 --> 09:02.538
might I have a word
with you in my office?

09:28.023 --> 09:29.316
Blimey.

09:39.993 --> 09:43.956
You are a regular
visitor to Glenbogle House.

09:44.039 --> 09:47.042
-I would never
allow my personal...
-I have a record here

09:47.126 --> 09:50.087
of your voting pattern
since you were elected.

09:50.170 --> 09:51.630
What?

09:51.714 --> 09:55.592
You argued for the upgrading
of the Glenbogle estate road.

09:55.676 --> 09:57.344
Yes, but that was
for the benefit...

09:57.428 --> 10:01.390
You proposed the installation
of a new filter
plant on the loch.

10:01.473 --> 10:02.975
We all needed the water.

10:03.058 --> 10:08.021
On the sports committee,
you argued against
the chair's advice,

10:08.105 --> 10:12.067
that the sum of
Â£200 was awarded
for the Hill Race.

10:12.735 --> 10:14.695
And so on.

10:14.778 --> 10:18.365
I'm proud of my voting record.
I've got nothing
to be ashamed of.

10:18.449 --> 10:21.201
Admit it, Miss Finlay.

10:21.285 --> 10:26.540
He has made a stooge of you
and it's there for all to see.

10:26.623 --> 10:28.292
I make my own decisions.

10:28.375 --> 10:31.712
Then listen very
carefully to me.

10:31.795 --> 10:35.716
You've got a great
future here, Katrina.

10:36.633 --> 10:38.927
It would be a terrible shame

10:39.011 --> 10:42.431
to see it blighted by
allegations of bias.

10:45.726 --> 10:49.897
So, I will ask you again,

10:49.980 --> 10:52.983
are you for or
against this plan?

11:05.704 --> 11:07.373
Archie, I'm sorry.

11:07.456 --> 11:10.250
-You didn't even vote for it.
-I couldn't do
a thing about it.

11:10.334 --> 11:12.252
Well, I can.
You can tell your cronies

11:12.336 --> 11:14.880
that I'll be back for
the full council
meeting on Monday.

11:14.963 --> 11:17.216
They're not my cronies.

11:17.299 --> 11:21.178
Don't kid yourself, Katrina.
That's exactly what they are
until you stand up to them.

11:55.504 --> 11:56.797
(SIGHING)

11:59.883 --> 12:01.051
Right.

12:07.683 --> 12:09.893
Ah, Duncan, you're a wonder.

12:11.520 --> 12:15.774
Right, let's get
that heather burnt up
at the north crag.

12:15.858 --> 12:17.568
-Aye.
-Something wrong
with your wrist, laddie?

12:17.651 --> 12:20.195
No, it's just that
Fergal said that we should...

12:20.279 --> 12:24.074
-You all right, Duncan?
-Ah. Aye, Fergal. Then
again it's just between...

12:24.158 --> 12:26.660
I haven't quite
finished with the boy yet.

12:28.412 --> 12:30.080
So much to do.

12:30.164 --> 12:33.751
Fair is fair, Golly.
I said two hours, you know.

12:33.834 --> 12:36.712
What's so important you
have to drag the lad
away from real work?

12:36.795 --> 12:38.756
I can't build
the aviary single-handed.

12:38.839 --> 12:40.716
Aviary. Give me strength.

12:40.799 --> 12:44.428
Yeah, well, I know you prefer
taking life rather than
preserving it so...

12:44.511 --> 12:46.430
Listen son, I've forgotten
more about conservation

12:46.513 --> 12:48.223
than you ever learned
at your precious universities.

12:48.307 --> 12:50.934
-Oh, come on, lads...
-Okay, Duncan!

12:52.853 --> 12:54.104
Let's go.

12:55.731 --> 12:56.982
Golly!

12:58.567 --> 13:01.403
I don't want to
fight with you.

13:01.487 --> 13:04.865
But Duncan's my deputy
and we got a lot
to get done today.

13:04.948 --> 13:09.078
Now, Archie specifically asked
us to get this aviary up and
running as soon as possible.

13:09.161 --> 13:11.246
That's right enough.

13:13.290 --> 13:17.711
-Well, so he did.
-So let's rock and roll.

13:42.111 --> 13:44.696
I want to know why you voted
against Archie's plan.

13:44.780 --> 13:48.283
-You know why.
-No, I don't know why.

13:50.077 --> 13:51.829
You obviously liked it.

13:51.912 --> 13:55.374
And so did the others.
Why don't you stand up to her?

13:55.457 --> 13:58.711
-It's complicated.
-Then explain it to me.

13:58.794 --> 14:01.964
I was left
completely isolated there.

14:02.047 --> 14:04.383
What are you all so afraid of?

14:08.011 --> 14:10.472
You'd better come inside.

14:15.310 --> 14:18.772
Yes! Yes! Yes!

14:18.856 --> 14:21.316
How long did it
take us to prepare
that presentation, Mother?

14:21.400 --> 14:23.193
Oh, weeks, darling.

14:23.277 --> 14:26.071
And how long did it
take them to reject it?

14:26.155 --> 14:31.243
-So you didn't
get the grant, then?
-No, but I will. I will.

14:32.619 --> 14:34.997
Hello, is that
the Press and Journal?

14:35.080 --> 14:38.667
Yes, I was wondering if you're
aware that we have
a council committed

14:38.751 --> 14:40.961
to destroying local tourism.

14:41.045 --> 14:42.671
Mother, what are you doing?

14:42.755 --> 14:45.215
Stopping you making
a fool of yourself.

14:45.299 --> 14:47.426
Look, I will get that grant
even if it means I have to

14:47.509 --> 14:49.219
take it to the
Scottish Parliament.

14:49.303 --> 14:51.013
You could take it to
the United Nations,

14:51.096 --> 14:53.474
but that committee
still wouldn't give
you a bean.

14:53.557 --> 14:55.642
Why?

14:55.726 --> 14:59.688
-Because it's
chaired by Edith Rankin.
-And what's that to me?

14:59.772 --> 15:02.983
I think you'd better
speak to your father.

15:03.067 --> 15:04.610
Right.

15:05.819 --> 15:07.321
Father?

15:07.404 --> 15:10.532
-Have you ever bowled,
Miss Finlay?
-No.

15:10.616 --> 15:13.118
Crown green bowling.

15:13.202 --> 15:17.873
The smell of new-mown grass,
the click of ebony on ebony.

15:24.171 --> 15:30.761
I was the president of
Glenbogle Bowling Club
in its glory year.1961.

15:30.844 --> 15:36.767
We didn't have a green of our
own then, which meant we
couldn't join the league.

15:36.850 --> 15:39.978
So, we decided to build one.

15:47.069 --> 15:49.071
I found the perfect site.

15:49.154 --> 15:53.659
Two hectares of virgin
turf overlooking the loch.

15:53.742 --> 15:56.620
It would've been
the best in the Highlands.

15:58.914 --> 16:02.501
Edith was against it.

16:02.584 --> 16:08.507
She said the money would
pay for an electronic voting
system for our chamber.

16:10.843 --> 16:13.887
So I took a stand.

16:16.765 --> 16:20.853
I took her on. Head to head.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.396
And what happened?

16:23.272 --> 16:25.607
She destroyed me.

16:25.691 --> 16:30.904
For the next 15 years,
I was in charge of public
toilets and litter bins.

16:32.865 --> 16:35.367
Take my word for it.

16:35.451 --> 16:40.664
If you want to stay
a councillor in Glenbogle,
you must keep your mouth shut.

16:41.582 --> 16:43.792
And your ears open.

16:52.718 --> 16:54.595
Father?

17:02.144 --> 17:04.021
Father?

17:05.897 --> 17:08.400
Father, are you up there?

17:15.699 --> 17:17.576
Father?

17:42.059 --> 17:45.354
I haven't been in
this old place for years.

17:45.437 --> 17:49.565
Splendid, isn't it?
My little den.

17:49.650 --> 17:53.236
What do I need to
know about Edith Rankin?

17:53.320 --> 17:57.449
Your mother wants to turn it
into some glorified cupboard,
but...

17:57.533 --> 17:59.159
I wouldn't change
it for the world.

17:59.243 --> 18:01.203
Edith Rankin.

18:02.328 --> 18:04.623
I think I need some air.

18:04.705 --> 18:06.709
Father...

18:06.791 --> 18:08.252
Oh.

18:10.254 --> 18:11.964
Oh, yes.

18:12.047 --> 18:14.341
Edith and I were at
primary school together.

18:14.425 --> 18:19.012
She used to come up here,
in her father's delivery van,
with the groceries.

18:19.096 --> 18:22.474
She was quite a tomboy.
Very, um, resourceful.

18:23.517 --> 18:24.977
And?

18:25.060 --> 18:29.648
-Well,
we grew up, stayed friends.
-Just friends?

18:29.732 --> 18:32.443
I'd see her at the odd dance.

18:32.526 --> 18:34.778
-Did you?
-No, I most certainly did not!

18:34.862 --> 18:36.029
I behaved honourably
throughout.

18:36.113 --> 18:38.615
There must be
more to it than that.

18:38.699 --> 18:42.911
Well, she may have had
a bit of a crush on me.

18:42.995 --> 18:45.664
Anyway, when I was
18 I went off to the army,

18:45.748 --> 18:47.958
came back four years
later married to your mother.

18:48.042 --> 18:50.711
Edith seemed to take the hump
at the whole family.

18:50.794 --> 18:53.338
"Never darken my
doors again," all that.

18:53.422 --> 18:57.384
She even hissed at
me in the street.
Profoundly embarrassing.

18:57.468 --> 18:59.887
When was this? When did
you last speak to her?

18:59.970 --> 19:01.930
1962.

19:02.014 --> 19:03.140
(SIGHING)

19:12.483 --> 19:15.986
You all right to finish up
here, Duncan? Because I've got
to get moving now.

19:16.070 --> 19:18.697
Aye.

19:18.781 --> 19:23.786
Um... Is this not a bit
big for just the one owl?

19:24.870 --> 19:30.125
Right.
Do you know what this...

19:30.209 --> 19:33.587
-You have no idea what
I'm up to here, do you?
-No.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.634
You better come with me.

19:46.850 --> 19:48.852
FERGAL: From this point here,

19:48.936 --> 19:53.565
to the north tip of the estate
and over to the loch,
that's 45,000 acres, right?

19:53.649 --> 19:55.192
DUNCAN: Aye.

19:55.275 --> 19:57.861
For too long, Duncan,
this land has been
a killing ground.

19:57.945 --> 20:02.366
If it moves,
stalk it, catch it, shoot it.

20:02.449 --> 20:05.619
-Those days are over.
-Yeah?

20:05.703 --> 20:08.122
With a bit of imagination
and a lot of hard work,

20:08.205 --> 20:12.418
Glenbogle could be
the premier wildlife
reserve of Scotland.

20:12.501 --> 20:15.504
We could reintroduce species
that have been driven out.

20:15.587 --> 20:19.758
Sea eagles,
red squirrels, otters.

20:19.842 --> 20:22.428
All running wild in
their own habitat.

20:22.511 --> 20:24.596
But what about
the stalking and the grouse?

20:24.680 --> 20:30.352
No. No, forget that, Duncan.
I'm talking about the future
here, okay, not the past.

20:30.436 --> 20:34.523
But to make it happen,
I need something.

20:35.816 --> 20:39.069
-What?
-Your support.

20:40.070 --> 20:43.031
-Me?
-100%.

20:44.366 --> 20:46.076
Are you up for it?

20:46.160 --> 20:49.455
Am... You bet!

20:49.538 --> 20:54.126
Good on you!
Now get that aviary finished.

20:57.713 --> 21:03.427
-Hey,
Fergal, you forgot your DGPS!
-Keep it. It's yours!

21:08.223 --> 21:11.727
Believe me, Archie, I...
I'm truly, truly sorry.

21:11.810 --> 21:14.229
If there's anything
I could do, I would.

21:14.313 --> 21:17.191
-There is
something you can do.
-Yes?

21:17.274 --> 21:19.109
You can call on Edith Rankin,

21:19.193 --> 21:21.737
apologise to her, and
get her to back the scheme.

21:21.820 --> 21:25.657
Call on her?
You can't ask me to do that.

21:25.741 --> 21:27.576
I can and you will.

21:27.659 --> 21:29.536
I absolutely will not!

21:29.620 --> 21:33.540
Under no circumstances
will I approach
that desiccated harpy!

21:37.127 --> 21:38.921
Let... Let go!

21:39.004 --> 21:41.548
-Come on!
-How dare you!

21:41.632 --> 21:46.845
I didn't drive through
Aden on a Bren gun tank
to be treated like this!

21:46.929 --> 21:48.806
Get in,
Mother, maximum security!

21:48.889 --> 21:53.185
Oh, no, you don't!
Now here's a rose for her.
She'll like that.

21:58.232 --> 22:03.445
They're terrified of her.
Who can blame them?

22:03.529 --> 22:08.575
She's completely
stitched me up.
I was totally useless.

22:08.659 --> 22:11.662
-You're not useless.
-Yes, I am.

22:11.745 --> 22:16.250
Look, you went down in the
first round, just count to
eight and come up punching.

22:16.333 --> 22:20.254
Golly, I'm so angry.
There's nothing I
can do about it.

22:20.337 --> 22:23.090
-Yes, there is.
-What?

22:23.173 --> 22:28.262
A man once said,
"Don't get mad,
get even," right?

22:28.345 --> 22:32.057
So if she's got files on you,
you get a filing
cabinet on her.

22:32.141 --> 22:33.851
If she threatens you with
public embarrassment,

22:33.934 --> 22:37.271
you promise her
public humiliation.

22:37.354 --> 22:41.692
-That's the way to
deal with Rankin.
-Right.

22:41.775 --> 22:45.779
Although, speaking personally
for myself, I don't think he
got it quite right.

22:45.863 --> 22:51.034
Because what I say is,
"Get mad and then get even."

23:28.781 --> 23:32.576
-Father, there's no
point in complaining.
-All right!

23:34.661 --> 23:36.080
-Come on.
-Outrageous!

23:36.163 --> 23:38.582
This is bally abduction,
you do realise that!

23:38.665 --> 23:41.418
-No, stop that nonsense.
-Father, come on, this way.

23:41.502 --> 23:43.796
-I don't know what to say!
-I've told you
what to say to her!

23:43.879 --> 23:47.049
-I was going fishing today!
-Behave yourself!
Behave yourself!

23:47.132 --> 23:50.094
Ring the bell. The bell.

23:56.308 --> 23:58.268
(DOORBELL RINGING)

24:16.453 --> 24:20.916
-Hello, Edie.
-Hello, Biscuit.

24:20.999 --> 24:25.087
Biscuit? Oh! Biscuit.

24:25.170 --> 24:28.924
I...
Just popped over for a chat.

25:09.048 --> 25:12.426
Aye,
you made a fine job of this.

25:13.594 --> 25:16.805
Aye. Well...

25:16.889 --> 25:21.560
-Listen, Golly,
I wanted to say sorry...
-Oh, pish, laddie.

25:21.643 --> 25:23.645
It should be me
apologising to you.

25:23.729 --> 25:25.856
Me and the lad Fergal
hammering away like that,

25:25.939 --> 25:28.984
put you in a... Put you
in a difficult position.

25:30.778 --> 25:33.447
-Well...
-No, no excuses, it's just...

25:33.530 --> 25:38.827
when you get to my age,
it's... difficult adapting
to changes, you know.

25:38.911 --> 25:43.332
Especially when you're
losing the company of
a really good friend.

25:43.415 --> 25:45.667
-Me?
-Look, uh...

25:45.751 --> 25:51.048
I'd like to give you this,
wish you all the best in
your... In your new job.

25:56.220 --> 25:57.554
You got that from your father.

25:57.638 --> 26:01.433
Aye.
He got it from his. Here.

26:07.773 --> 26:09.525
It's beautiful,
but I couldn't...

26:09.608 --> 26:12.152
Who else am I
gonna give it to, son?

26:12.236 --> 26:16.573
I don't know what to say.

26:16.657 --> 26:21.662
Uh, look,
I'd better get on my way.
Heather won't burn by itself.

26:24.415 --> 26:26.792
All right, I'll see you.

26:29.211 --> 26:32.881
Golly! Hang on a minute.
I'll give you a hand.

26:32.965 --> 26:34.967
No, no, no, no,
I don't... I don't want you...

26:35.050 --> 26:37.302
I don't want to put
you to any trouble.

26:37.386 --> 26:41.682
Och, away.
An hour won't matter.

26:41.765 --> 26:43.851
Okay. Grand.

27:09.918 --> 27:12.463
So...

27:12.546 --> 27:15.632
to what do I
owe this pleasure?

27:15.716 --> 27:16.800
Er...

27:16.884 --> 27:21.388
-Still one lump?
-Oh! Yes, of course.

27:21.472 --> 27:26.643
(CLEARING THROAT)
To tell the truth,
Edith, it's about the boy.

27:26.727 --> 27:31.732
-Archie. Fine young lad.
-Indeed.
We're all very proud of him.

27:31.815 --> 27:36.862
He, uh, intends to resubmit
his plans for the estate to
the full council.

27:36.945 --> 27:41.158
Yes, I heard him. Shouting
as much in the street.

27:41.241 --> 27:43.952
He's a very
passionate young man, Edith.

27:44.036 --> 27:47.373
I can't overstate
how important this
project is to him.

27:47.456 --> 27:51.627
I mean, if this fails,
I don't know
where we're gonna go.

27:53.379 --> 27:56.006
-You remembered!
-Pardon?

27:56.090 --> 28:00.552
The rose of Glenbogle.
From your mother's garden.

28:02.304 --> 28:05.182
Oh, yes, of course!

28:07.559 --> 28:11.271
The 13th of August, 1958.

28:12.898 --> 28:16.860
-Yes...
-The night you
left for the army.

28:16.944 --> 28:21.698
And your family held
a ball at Glenbogle
in honour of you.

28:21.782 --> 28:23.158
Happy days.

28:23.242 --> 28:26.787
We danced
the buckles off our shoes!

28:26.870 --> 28:30.958
And after the last waltz,
you took me out to the garden.

28:31.041 --> 28:35.671
We held hands
and looked at
the moonlight on the loch,

28:35.754 --> 28:38.924
and you swore you'd return.

28:40.092 --> 28:44.179
And,
aye, you plucked me a rose.

28:44.263 --> 28:48.016
As a token. As a promise.

28:49.852 --> 28:52.688
And I waited, Hector.

28:52.771 --> 28:56.316
I had offers, but I waited.

28:57.526 --> 29:02.698
Four years. Four long years.

29:03.866 --> 29:08.996
And then you came back.
Married.

29:09.079 --> 29:14.293
You walked into my father's
shop and do you
remember what you said?

29:16.462 --> 29:19.423
"Half a pound of beef links."

29:20.591 --> 29:23.969
-Half a pound...
-Of beef links.

29:24.053 --> 29:28.182
You broke my heart,
Hector Naismith MacDonald.

29:28.265 --> 29:33.312
-Oh, come on now. Steady on.
-Not one word! For 40 years!

29:33.395 --> 29:38.734
Not one Christmas card!
Not one glance in the street!

29:38.817 --> 29:44.531
And now you have the
barefaced gall to come here
pleading for money?

29:44.615 --> 29:48.660
Well, let me tell you,
hell will freeze over

29:48.744 --> 29:52.164
before one penny
piece of council money

29:52.247 --> 29:56.001
is spent
in the cursed
environs of Glenbogle House!

30:25.906 --> 30:27.741
BOTH: Well?

30:27.825 --> 30:30.160
I think
the rose was a mistake.

30:45.676 --> 30:47.261
(OWL SQUAWKING)

30:55.436 --> 31:00.315
Okay, we should have this done
by 6:00 and then we'll head
for a wee dram, Duncan.

31:00.399 --> 31:02.192
I'm up for that, Golly!

31:02.276 --> 31:05.988
You know,
it's good to be away up here.

31:06.071 --> 31:10.951
-I mean, out from the house.
-Then there'll be more
to do tomorrow, laddie.

31:11.034 --> 31:13.245
Well, you can count me in.

31:25.466 --> 31:28.218
FERGAL:
What are you doing up here?
GOLLY: He's working with me.

31:28.302 --> 31:30.846
-The owl's escaped!
-What?

31:30.929 --> 31:34.725
Well, if you're daft enough
to keep vermin in cages,
what do you expect?

31:34.808 --> 31:37.436
The owl's got out and
you're gonna find her.
So come on!

31:37.519 --> 31:40.064
Is that what you
call authority?
Shouting at the boy?

31:40.147 --> 31:41.857
-What?
-Bellowing at him.

31:41.940 --> 31:43.901
Do you think that'll
make him do what you want?

31:43.984 --> 31:46.862
Well, I don't know
how you got him up here,
but I bet it wasn't his idea!

31:46.945 --> 31:52.117
-You'd lose your bet, laddie.
-Okay, then. All right,
let's see, shall we?

31:53.160 --> 31:55.621
Duncan!

31:55.704 --> 31:59.583
Dunc, my man.
What do you want to do?

31:59.666 --> 32:02.461
Do you want to stay
here and play with fire,

32:02.544 --> 32:07.383
or do you want to come with me
and really do something
useful with your life?

32:07.466 --> 32:10.094
-I...
-What's it gonna be?

32:14.264 --> 32:16.558
Aw, this isn't right!

32:19.269 --> 32:23.482
GOLLY: Duncan!
FERGAL: Duncan!
Duncan, come back!

32:53.929 --> 32:55.764
Lexie.

33:02.896 --> 33:06.275
-No, go on.
-No, it's okay.

33:14.700 --> 33:17.619
Why do you never see
two owls in the rain?

33:20.164 --> 33:24.585
Because it's too wet
to woo, too wet to woo!

33:31.050 --> 33:33.135
Please yourselves.

34:12.674 --> 34:14.467
Duncan!

34:16.719 --> 34:18.263
(BANGING ON DOOR)

34:18.347 --> 34:23.560
Come on, Duncan!
I've got food for you.

34:25.813 --> 34:30.150
The owl might come back.
Okay? Please yourself.

34:54.341 --> 34:58.762
Not a peep out of him.
Poor lad'll starve if
he carries on like this.

35:01.265 --> 35:04.017
I hope you two are
proud of yourselves.

35:15.279 --> 35:19.783
Oh, Archie. Go to your bed.

35:19.867 --> 35:22.453
I can't sleep, Mother.

35:22.536 --> 35:25.956
Don't worry about the grant.
Something will turn up.

35:27.124 --> 35:29.752
I wish I had your optimism.

35:29.835 --> 35:34.797
But you've got determination.
If anyone can do it, you can.

35:37.176 --> 35:39.136
Don't stay up too late.

35:41.388 --> 35:44.016
Good night, Mother.

36:24.556 --> 36:27.434
Archie? Archie, wake up.

36:29.728 --> 36:34.608
-Oh, hi.
-Here, take this.
You're going to need it.

36:36.610 --> 36:40.197
The woman has
consistently bullied,
pressurised and subverted

36:40.280 --> 36:43.492
every single
member of this committee
at one time or another.

36:43.575 --> 36:47.996
Look at this. Alistair's
bowling green, rejected.

36:48.080 --> 36:51.834
The post office extension,
and look,
the new florist conservatory,

36:51.917 --> 36:54.962
and
the butcher's street display,
all got the same treatment.

36:55.045 --> 36:59.800
But every single scheme
that had her name
on it, got passed.

36:59.883 --> 37:05.764
Look at this.
And this, and this.

37:05.848 --> 37:08.726
This is all very interesting,
Katrina,
but what good will it do me?

37:08.809 --> 37:10.686
They're far too scared of her.

37:10.769 --> 37:14.982
But don't you see?
They all must
have an axe to grind.

37:15.065 --> 37:17.276
If we can persuade
them to pull together,

37:17.359 --> 37:20.946
we could get them to overthrow
her and Rankin would
lose her power.

37:21.029 --> 37:25.576
All we have to do is
nobble the committee
before the meeting.

37:25.659 --> 37:27.703
You're becoming devious,
Miss Finlay.

37:27.786 --> 37:30.289
No, I'm not.
I'm becoming a politician.

37:47.097 --> 37:48.807
Come on, Duncan!

37:51.727 --> 37:55.189
Duncan? Duncan!

38:02.196 --> 38:03.530
(BIRDS FLUTTERING)

38:03.614 --> 38:04.990
Dash!

38:07.409 --> 38:09.161
(BIRD SQUAWKING)

38:09.244 --> 38:12.456
-LEXIE:
Have you two seen Duncan?
-Not since last night.

38:12.539 --> 38:14.833
I saw him heading
up towards Benbogle.

38:14.917 --> 38:17.503
-We better get after him.
-When we find
him we'll call you.

38:17.586 --> 38:21.131
-Hold on! I'm coming with you.
-What happens
if he calls here?

38:21.215 --> 38:24.802
Would you mind buzzing off?
You're in my line of fire.

38:24.885 --> 38:26.387
Come on.

38:32.893 --> 38:34.937
Bull's-eye!

38:54.456 --> 38:57.501
KATRINA: We just
have to have the courage
to stick together.

38:57.584 --> 39:00.379
-And the others have agreed?
-Yes.

39:00.462 --> 39:05.008
Only on the condition
that you vote with us.
They respect you.

39:05.092 --> 39:10.139
Edith will be devastated.
The council's her whole life.

39:10.222 --> 39:13.726
-I could never
hurt her in that way.
-She'd get over it.

39:13.809 --> 39:17.271
What if the motion failed?
I've got a lot to lose.

39:18.063 --> 39:19.898
And a lot to gain.

39:19.982 --> 39:22.317
If you could just
stand up to her now,
who knows what might happen?

39:22.401 --> 39:27.531
Imagine how proud your old
mates would be as you unveiled
the Glenbogle Bowling Green.

39:27.614 --> 39:31.827
The smell of newly-mown grass,
the click of ebony on ebony...

39:36.081 --> 39:39.418
It's too risky.

39:39.501 --> 39:44.089
Just think about it,
Alistair, please.
You could really help us out.

40:01.690 --> 40:04.651
FERGAL: Duncan!

40:07.446 --> 40:09.615
Duncan!

40:17.539 --> 40:20.250
Duncan!

40:51.031 --> 40:55.536
So, that concludes all
the business of the day.

40:55.619 --> 40:59.623
No. No, it doesn't.

40:59.707 --> 41:03.669
I'd like to propose an appeal
to reverse the decision of
the Tourism Committee

41:03.752 --> 41:06.630
on the matter of the Glenbogle
Adventure Centre.

41:06.714 --> 41:09.675
I understood we had
resolved that matter.

41:09.758 --> 41:11.719
Not to my satisfaction.

41:12.636 --> 41:13.929
(CROWD MURMURING)

41:14.888 --> 41:16.306
Silence!

41:18.851 --> 41:20.978
Well, do I hear a seconder?

41:23.772 --> 41:26.275
No? Grand.

41:26.358 --> 41:31.196
Perhaps in the future
you won't waste our time
with pointless interruptions.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.741
So you can get
your way as usual?

41:33.824 --> 41:35.909
I mean, that's what
we're all here for, isn't it?

41:35.993 --> 41:39.580
I don't have to justify
anything to you, madam.

41:39.663 --> 41:42.833
I have given my
life to this council.

41:42.916 --> 41:47.254
There is not one
decision we've ever taken
that I can't defend.

41:47.337 --> 41:50.883
-What about the extension
to the post office?
-Too disruptive.

41:50.966 --> 41:52.551
Or the conservatory
at the florist's?

41:52.634 --> 41:56.013
Too
distracting for motorists.

41:56.096 --> 42:01.977
-What about the new
crown bowling green?
-Too damn childish.

42:02.061 --> 42:06.648
Time after time,
I have been forced to
make unpopular decisions,

42:06.732 --> 42:10.444
but my judgement has
always been proved right.

42:10.527 --> 42:15.574
Even Mr Reid has to agree
that my analogue
conferencing network

42:15.657 --> 42:17.367
is a damn sight more useful

42:17.451 --> 42:21.997
than a silly patch of grass
and some overgrown marbles.

42:22.081 --> 42:27.044
Enough! Enough. How dare you!

42:27.127 --> 42:31.965
How dare you dismiss the hopes
and dreams of good
and decent people?

42:32.049 --> 42:36.804
I'll second Miss Finlay's
motion, with pleasure!

42:36.887 --> 42:39.848
If we don't support
our local youngsters...

42:39.932 --> 42:43.769
We deserve less respect
than the dogs in the street!

42:44.686 --> 42:46.230
I move to the vote.

43:05.708 --> 43:07.584
The motion is passed.

43:08.419 --> 43:09.962
(CROWD CHEERING)

43:17.261 --> 43:19.596
So... What now?

43:20.389 --> 43:22.099
Right, uh...

43:23.392 --> 43:27.062
You try over there.
I'll go up here.

43:27.146 --> 43:30.357
-I'll go up here.
The road's easier.
-What?

43:30.441 --> 43:35.070
-I'll go up here.
That way's easier.
-What do you mean?

43:35.154 --> 43:36.488
I'm just saying
this way's steeper.

43:36.572 --> 43:40.659
You saying I can't
manage a wee bitty hill?

43:40.743 --> 43:45.164
Well, let's face it, Golly,
you're no spring chicken.

43:45.247 --> 43:48.083
I've just about had it
with your smart wee remarks.

43:48.167 --> 43:50.878
Yeah? So what are
we gonna do about it?

43:50.961 --> 43:54.298
-Suppose we
settle it here and now?
-All right.

43:57.384 --> 44:02.890
Look at you!
You're pathetic! Both of you!

44:02.973 --> 44:08.103
The whole place is
turning into a midden
and all you can do is fight.

44:08.187 --> 44:11.315
You seem to think I'm
some sort of village idiot

44:11.398 --> 44:16.487
that can be bribed
into supporting you!
Well, I'm not!

44:16.570 --> 44:22.493
Here's your fancy global
positioning and there's your
hand-tooled gun!

44:22.576 --> 44:26.914
If we can't work together,
all of us,

44:26.997 --> 44:29.833
then the estate's
gonna go belly up,

44:29.917 --> 44:33.504
and it's gonna be your fault!

44:37.591 --> 44:39.676
I'm away to see Archie.

44:39.760 --> 44:43.389
I've got the owl, Lex.
Would you give
me a lift, please?

45:07.788 --> 45:10.499
Come to rub salt in, have you?

45:10.582 --> 45:14.378
No, not at all. Actually...

45:16.714 --> 45:19.967
We've come to invite
you to a celebration.

45:20.050 --> 45:23.053
So that I can be
paraded in defeat.

45:23.137 --> 45:25.681
There are no winners
or losers here, Edith.

45:25.764 --> 45:30.519
You don't know politics,
Katrina.
It's a cruel business.

45:30.602 --> 45:34.148
I want to work with you.
Not against you.

45:34.231 --> 45:39.528
You've got so much to offer.
Please come with us.

45:39.611 --> 45:43.866
To that house?
I could never go back there.

45:44.825 --> 45:46.118
Never.

45:54.168 --> 45:59.339
Miss Rankin,
I know how you must feel.

45:59.423 --> 46:02.926
There's no pain like old pain,

46:03.010 --> 46:08.057
twisting inside you, buried
so deep that nothing or
nobody can touch it.

46:09.141 --> 46:10.434
I know.

46:11.935 --> 46:14.646
And we can't
change the past, can we?

46:17.107 --> 46:22.988
But we can hope
for a better future
and try to enjoy the present.

46:23.072 --> 46:27.993
I'd be honoured if you'd come
to my home and grace us
with your presence.

46:29.244 --> 46:30.454
Please.

46:34.958 --> 46:39.630
-To the Glenbogle
Adventure Centre!
-ALL: Cheers.

46:39.713 --> 46:42.549
I knew the lad had it in him.
I told you I had it
all under control.

46:42.633 --> 46:48.931
Of course you did, dear.
Ah. The heroes return!

46:49.014 --> 46:52.559
Anybody wants a sherbet,
sherbet is right here.
Help yourselves.

46:55.813 --> 46:57.648
-Come here.
-Watch it...

46:58.941 --> 47:00.901
Somebody wants
to speak to you.

47:00.984 --> 47:03.404
Oh, for heaven's sake,
can't you see I'm
engaged in vital war work?

47:03.487 --> 47:05.656
In the garden now.

47:05.739 --> 47:07.157
-Oh.
-Go on.

47:10.202 --> 47:12.871
-Beer?
-Sure.

47:54.371 --> 47:59.209
-Edie.
-Hello, Biscuit.

47:59.293 --> 48:03.380
Edie, I'd like to
apologise for my behaviour
all those years ago.

48:04.214 --> 48:07.342
I'm truly, truly sorry.

48:07.426 --> 48:12.723
I haven't seen this
view for 40 years.
It's such a waste.

48:13.682 --> 48:16.143
Such a waste.

48:16.226 --> 48:19.188
I... I knew you
had feelings for me

48:19.271 --> 48:23.317
and...I took fright, I
suppose. That's why I
never made contact.

48:23.400 --> 48:27.738
Damn callous of me.
Will you...
Will you try to forgive me?

48:32.951 --> 48:36.538
Yes, Hector. I will.

48:37.623 --> 48:40.709
Welcome back to Glenbogle.

48:41.627 --> 48:43.295
Come here.

48:49.385 --> 48:50.803
Shall we go in?

48:59.103 --> 49:03.273
You were
magnificent in there today.
I owe you everything.

49:03.357 --> 49:07.319
No, you don't.
I was just helping out
one of my constituents.

49:08.153 --> 49:09.905
Is that all it was?

49:17.538 --> 49:23.085
Sorry to be a party pooper,
Archie. You ready?

49:23.168 --> 49:25.587
Fergal's taking
me out to dinner.

49:25.671 --> 49:30.050
Oh. Right. Well...

49:30.134 --> 49:34.680
-Well, uh, enjoy yourselves.
-We will. See you later.

49:46.483 --> 49:48.694
Welcome, Edith, welcome.

49:48.777 --> 49:50.612
-Thank you.
-LEXIE: Music!

49:58.203 --> 50:02.166
Come on! Come on!
Arch, come dance. Come on!

50:16.889 --> 50:18.057
May I?
