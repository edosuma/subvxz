WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:02.770
April:  PREVIOUSLY ON
CHASING LIFE...

00:03.003 --> 00:04.637
HOW DID THE MEETING GO
YESTERDAY FOR THE NEW
CLINICAL TRIAL?

00:04.671 --> 00:06.373
IT WASN'T THE OUTCOME
WE'D HOPED FOR,

00:06.407 --> 00:09.609
BUT I HAVE A MEETING
REGARDING A SIMILAR TRIAL
FROM NORATIS.

00:09.643 --> 00:13.413
WHEN I TOLD ANDREW AND MARIAH
THAT I DIDN'T SEE YOU LIKE THAT,

00:13.446 --> 00:15.215
IT'S NOT THAT I COULDN'T.

00:15.249 --> 00:18.051
IT'S THAT I DON'T LET MYSELF

00:18.085 --> 00:19.320
BECAUSE...

00:19.353 --> 00:20.754
WHAT COULD WE DO ABOUT IT?

00:20.788 --> 00:22.455
CAN I READ THAT BOOK
THAT YOU WERE TELLING
ME ABOUT?

00:22.489 --> 00:24.225
April:
IT'S MY ONLY COPY, SO...

00:24.257 --> 00:25.760
I WILL BE CAREFUL WITH IT.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.396
Operator:
911, what's your emergency?

00:28.428 --> 00:31.498
MY HUSBAND,
HE'S NOT BREATHING.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.634
I CAN'T LIVE
WITHOUT HIM.

01:00.561 --> 01:03.229
THANK YOU FOR COMING BY,
MR. BEGLEY. I'LL SHOW YOU OUT.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.269
(door opens)

01:10.403 --> 01:11.605
(door closes)

01:16.210 --> 01:17.545
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

01:19.447 --> 01:21.515
UM... OVERWHELMED.

01:21.549 --> 01:23.117
JUST...

01:23.150 --> 01:25.453
-IT'S...
-IT'S VERY BITTERSWEET.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.820
YOUR HUSBAND DIES,

01:26.853 --> 01:28.588
BUT YOU INHERIT THIS MONEY.

01:28.621 --> 01:29.623
I DON'T WANT IT.

01:29.656 --> 01:32.526
I THINK I SHOULD
JUST GIVE IT BACK.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.593
AW, HONEY.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.563
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER
WHEN YOUR DAD DIED

01:35.596 --> 01:37.664
AND HIS LIFE INSURANCE
MONEY CAME IN.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.233
I FELT SO STRANGE.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.534
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T FEEL
BAD ABOUT THIS.

01:41.569 --> 01:44.638
IT'S A NICE NEST EGG,
AND IT IS WHAT LEO WANTED.

01:44.671 --> 01:47.508
I GUESS.

01:47.540 --> 01:50.844
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT
TO TALK TO SOMEBODY,
I CAN FIND--

01:50.878 --> 01:52.746
MOM, TOLD YOU I DON'T
WANT TO GO TO THERAPY.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.783
OKAY, IT'S JUST THAT
WITH YOU CRASHING
AT BETH'S ALL WEEK,

01:55.816 --> 01:59.152
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO SEE
HOW YOU'RE DOING.

01:59.186 --> 02:00.521
I WORRY ABOUT YOU.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.188
I'M FINE.

02:02.222 --> 02:03.557
REALLY.

02:05.692 --> 02:09.295
THOUGH, WE SHOULD PROBABLY
SELL LEO'S MOTORCYCLE.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.532
IT FEELS KIND OF WEIRD
SELLING ANY OF HIS STUFF.

02:11.564 --> 02:13.700
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU CAN RIDE IT, SO...

02:13.734 --> 02:15.536
WHAT'S THE POINT?

02:18.271 --> 02:20.274
Beth: DO YOU, LIKE,
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA DO WITH THE MONEY?

02:20.306 --> 02:21.542
April:
NO IDEA.

02:21.574 --> 02:23.343
I'D PROBABLY BLOW IT
ALL ON ETSY.

02:23.377 --> 02:24.745
I'M SO BAD WITH MONEY.

02:24.777 --> 02:26.680
BUT YOU, YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE.

02:26.713 --> 02:28.848
YOU SHOULD LIKE,
RENT YOUR OWN PLACE.

02:28.883 --> 02:31.384
I MEAN... (sighs)

02:31.418 --> 02:33.486
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I LOVED HAVING YOU
STAY WITH ME.

02:33.521 --> 02:35.288
WHICH I SO APPRECIATE.

02:35.322 --> 02:38.825
I MEAN, YOU'VE SAVED ME
FROM HAVING MY MOM'S
CONCERNED FACE

02:38.859 --> 02:40.860
PEER DOWN ON ME 24/7.

02:40.895 --> 02:42.795
OH!

02:42.829 --> 02:45.365
YOU'RE RIGHT, THOUGH.
I SHOULD PROBABLY START
LOOKING FOR MY OWN PLACE.

02:45.399 --> 02:48.301
YOU KNOW, ONCE BRENNA
GRADUATES, IT WILL ONLY
BE ME AND MOM AT THE HOUSE,

02:48.335 --> 02:51.204
AND SO NOT INTERESTED
IN GOING ALL  GREY GARDENS
WITH HER.

02:51.237 --> 02:53.373
WELL WHY NOT? YOU'D MAKE
A GREAT LITTLE EDIE.

02:53.406 --> 02:54.741
YOU ALREADY KNOW
HOW TO PULL OFF
A HEAD-WRAP.

02:57.243 --> 02:59.612
HOW ABOUT YOU?
HOW DID JACLYN LIKE
THAT DESIGN YOU SHOWED HER?

02:59.646 --> 03:02.716
AND... HOW WAS YOUR DATE
LAST NIGHT WITH JOSH?

03:02.750 --> 03:04.183
HAVE YOU GUYS
DONE IT YET?

03:04.217 --> 03:05.652
WORK'S GOOD,
JOSH IS GOOD.

03:05.686 --> 03:06.854
ALL'S GOOD, YUP.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.354
AND I REALLY NEED
A COFFEE.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.424
I'M FINALLY AT THE AGE
WHERE I TOTALLY GET
THOSE MUGS

03:10.456 --> 03:13.193
THAT ARE LIKE,
"DON'T TALK TO ME UNTIL
I'VE HAD MY MORNING COFFEE."

03:13.227 --> 03:15.396
AND IT'S LIKE,
SO SAD AND...

03:21.735 --> 03:23.971
LEO AND I USED TO ALWAYS
WALK DOWN THIS STREET
AND LAUGH

03:24.204 --> 03:26.372
AT THE RIDICULOUS THINGS
IN THE WINDOWS.

03:26.407 --> 03:27.608
THOUGH, I DID ALWAYS SAY,

03:27.640 --> 03:29.576
I WOULDN'T MIND
A PAIR OF LOUBOUTINS.

03:29.610 --> 03:30.843
YEAH, WHO WOULDN'T?

03:30.877 --> 03:32.680
THEY COST LIKE...
A FORTUNE.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.216
(sighs)

03:36.250 --> 03:38.284
BETH, YOU'VE BEEN
AN AMAZING FRIEND TO ME
THIS PAST WEEK,

03:38.319 --> 03:39.954
AND I THINK YOU
DESERVE A GIFT.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.358
(chuckles)

03:44.390 --> 03:47.394
I THINK WE BOTH
DESERVE GIFTS.

03:47.427 --> 03:49.530
-OH, MY GOD,
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
-(chuckles)

03:49.562 --> 03:51.564
-OH, MY GOD, APRIL!
-LET'S DO IT.

03:51.598 --> 03:55.235
-(theme music playing)
- ♪ YOU BET YOUR SOUL, HONEY ♪

03:55.269 --> 03:57.871
♪ YOU BET YOUR SOUL ♪

03:57.905 --> 04:02.909
♪ JUST RIGHT ♪

04:02.943 --> 04:07.881
♪ YOU COULD STAY ALL NIGHT
AND NEVER WANNA GO HOME ♪

04:07.914 --> 04:09.917
♪ 'CAUSE WE CAN'T STOP ♪

04:09.949 --> 04:11.618
♪ WE WON'T STOP ♪

04:13.787 --> 04:16.523
THOSE REALLY ARE
BEAUTIFUL SHOES.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.725
I'M SO GLAD
YOU TREATED YOURSELF.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.259
WELL, I FIGURED I MIGHT
AS WELL, RIGHT?

04:20.293 --> 04:21.928
-(knock on door)
-APRIL CARVER?

04:21.961 --> 04:24.932
HI, I'M DR. ALEX BARRATT.

04:24.964 --> 04:27.768
-HI.
-CONGRATS ON GETTING
INTO THIS TRIAL.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.603
I HEAR IT WAS COMPETITIVE.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.971
VERY.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.805
YEAH, LIKE YOU
HAVE NO IDEA.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.576
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN--
IT WAS... HARD.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.978
I'M SORRY, I'M SARA.

04:38.012 --> 04:40.447
-HI.
-HI.

04:43.449 --> 04:44.817
SORRY, CONTINUE.

04:44.851 --> 04:46.987
WELL, IT WAS PROBABLY
COMPETITIVE

04:47.021 --> 04:48.689
BECAUSE NORATIS
AND I ARE BOTH

04:48.721 --> 04:51.425
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT
THE POSSIBLE RESULTS
THE TRIAL COULD YIELD.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.726
IT'D BE GREAT
TO GET YOU STARTED TODAY.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.863
WHAT'S THE MEDICAL
KIT FOR?

04:56.896 --> 04:58.432
IT CONTAINS
THE SYRINGES.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.632
NEEDLES?

04:59.667 --> 05:01.735
THE TRIAL IS
A THREE-STEP PROCEDURE,

05:01.769 --> 05:03.336
TO BE DONE TWICE A DAY.

05:03.370 --> 05:05.639
FIRST, YOU'LL START
WITH A STEROID TO STAVE
OFF THE NAUSEA

05:05.673 --> 05:07.408
THAT THE TRIAL COULD CAUSE.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.978
THEN YOU'LL INJECT YOURSELF
WITH A MICROTUBULE INHIBITOR
CHEMO SHOT,

05:11.011 --> 05:12.946
FINALLY FOLLOWED BY

05:12.980 --> 05:15.382
A TYROSINE-KINASE INHIBITOR.

05:15.415 --> 05:18.786
TKI, AS THE COOL KIDS CALL IT.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.889
APRIL'S A TAD QUEASY
ABOUT BLOOD AND NEEDLES.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.490
IT'S OKAY.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.559
IF I HAVE TO STICK MYSELF
WITH A NEEDLE TWICE A DAY,

05:25.591 --> 05:26.694
THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.728
I'M READY TO START THIS TRIAL.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.730
I WANT TO GET BETTER.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.533
GOOD.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.872
THAT DR. BARRATT
IS LIKE McDREAMY.

05:39.906 --> 05:41.507
McDREAMY'S DEAD, MOM.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.110
WELL, HE'S LIKE McSTEAMY.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.612
DEAD TOO.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.413
WELL, HE SEEMS NICE.

05:47.447 --> 05:48.649
YEAH.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.651
THIS TRIAL IS GONNA BE INTENSE

05:50.683 --> 05:52.452
AND PRETTY TAXING ON YOU.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.487
I KNOW.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.656
YOU KNOW, I GET THAT
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO
THE ONE-ON-ONE THERAPY,

05:56.689 --> 06:00.026
BUT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE NOW'S
NOT A BAD TIME TO AT LEAST
GO BACK INTO SUPPORT GROUP.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.428
YOU KNOW, IT COULD BE HELPFUL
TO BE AROUND PEOPLE

06:02.463 --> 06:04.363
WHO CAN EMPATHIZE
WITH WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

06:04.398 --> 06:06.666
THAT'S NOT A HORRIBLE IDEA.

06:06.699 --> 06:10.069
SEE? I CAN HAVE
SOME NOT-HORRIBLE IDEAS.

06:10.103 --> 06:13.473
HEY, WHAT ABOUT
GEORGE O'MALLEY?
IS HE STILL ALIVE?

06:13.507 --> 06:14.742
NO.

06:18.612 --> 06:19.947
(knocking)

06:21.115 --> 06:22.382
HI.

06:22.415 --> 06:23.684
HI, I'M BRENNA.

06:23.716 --> 06:26.386
I FIGURED SINCE FINN
WASN'T IN SCHOOL TODAY,

06:26.420 --> 06:27.687
I'D BRING OVER
HIS ASSIGNMENTS.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.423
THAT'S SO SWEET OF YOU.

06:29.456 --> 06:31.024
-YOU'RE THE ONE WITH
THE SICK SISTER, RIGHT?
-(kids yelling)

06:31.057 --> 06:33.427
-MOM!
-CONNOR! RORY!

06:33.459 --> 06:34.728
IS FINN ALL RIGHT?

06:34.762 --> 06:37.697
YEAH. HE'S COME DOWN
WITH SOMETHING, BUT...

06:37.730 --> 06:39.766
(kids screaming)

06:39.800 --> 06:41.067
HE'S IN THERE.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.437
I NEED TO MAKE SURE
THAT NOBODY'S BEEN MANGLED

06:43.470 --> 06:45.538
OR KILLED. YOU NEVER KNOW
IN THIS HOUSE.

06:48.975 --> 06:50.843
(TV playing on iPad)

06:50.877 --> 06:53.747
GILMORE GIRLS?  REALLY?

06:53.781 --> 06:55.816
I DON'T KNOW WHY
THAT'S ON THERE.

06:55.848 --> 06:57.151
OH.

06:57.183 --> 07:00.420
SO YOUR MOM SAID
THAT YOU'VE COME DOWN
WITH SOMETHING?

07:00.454 --> 07:02.723
THAT'S A NICE WAY
OF PUTTING IT.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.423
I HAVE GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST.

07:04.458 --> 07:05.725
-IT'S WHEN--
-YEAH, I KNOW.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.927
IT'S WHEN THE DONOR CELLS

07:07.961 --> 07:10.129
FROM THE TRANSPLANT ATTACK
THE BODY, RIGHT?

07:10.163 --> 07:11.964
YUP, IT'S FUN STUFF

07:11.999 --> 07:15.601
WITH SOME EXCITING SIDE EFFECTS
LIKE PUKING, A RASH,

07:15.636 --> 07:17.805
GOING TO THE BATHROOM A LOT,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.038
EW!

07:19.072 --> 07:20.473
NO OFFENSE.

07:20.507 --> 07:21.809
NONE TAKEN.

07:21.841 --> 07:23.009
YEAH.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.944
THIS THING CAN GO AWAY
WITH THE RIGHT DRUGS,

07:24.978 --> 07:28.615
BUT NONE OF THE ONES MY DOCTORS
ARE PRESCRIBING SEEM TO BE
WORKING, SO...

07:30.483 --> 07:32.619
I'M SURE THEY'LL FIGURE OUT
SOMETHING SOON.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.588
THEY KEPT ME ALIVE
THIS LONG.

07:35.822 --> 07:37.591
SO THAT MEANS
YOU'RE IN LUCK.

07:37.624 --> 07:38.692
I WON'T BE ABLE
TO SEE YOUR SHOW

07:38.725 --> 07:41.661
AT THE AUTEUR SHOWCASE
TOMORROW NIGHT.

07:41.694 --> 07:43.596
AW, SHUCKS!

07:43.629 --> 07:46.233
THAT'S TOO BAD.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.769
OKAY, HEY, I REALLY WAS
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.504
I PICKED OUT A HOODIE
AND EVERYTHING.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.507
IT'S REALLY NO BIG DEAL.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.808
BUT... IT IS.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.744
I MEAN, I KNOW
YOU'RE NERVOUS ABOUT IT

07:57.778 --> 07:59.245
AND YOU WANT TO DO IT ALONE,

07:59.478 --> 08:01.682
BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD
INVITE FORD?

08:01.714 --> 08:05.485
OR MAYBE SOME OF YOUR...

08:05.519 --> 08:07.187
I'M GONNA TRY TO GET IT
RIGHT THIS TIME,

08:07.221 --> 08:11.625
LGBT Q... A...

08:12.925 --> 08:15.596
I FRIENDS?

08:15.629 --> 08:16.730
NAILED IT!

08:16.762 --> 08:18.130
YES!

08:18.165 --> 08:21.768
I'M NOT SO SURE THAT I WANT
TO SUBJECT PEOPLE TO THE MOVIE.

08:21.802 --> 08:25.672
REALLY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.106
SO, FINN, JUST A QUESTION,

08:27.139 --> 08:28.809
WHO'S YOUR FAVORITE
GILMORE GIRL?

08:28.841 --> 08:30.543
LORELAI, OBVIOUSLY.

08:30.576 --> 08:32.745
MM-HMM, YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

08:36.549 --> 08:38.085
IT WAS DEFINITELY
A PUNCH TO THE GUT

08:38.118 --> 08:39.986
WHEN THE DOCTORS
TOLD ME THE NEWS.

08:40.019 --> 08:43.023
BUT I BELIEVE EVERYTHING
HAPPENS FOR A REASON

08:43.056 --> 08:46.860
AND I'VE DECIDED I'M GONNA
STAY POSITIVE.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.562
I WILL GET BETTER.

08:48.595 --> 08:50.596
YOU ARE GONNA KICK
CANCER'S BUTT, CARLY.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.967
WELL, IT'S ONLY WHEN WE'RE FACED
WITH OUR GREATEST OBSTACLES

08:55.001 --> 08:57.169
DO WE TRULY LEARN
JUST HOW STRONG WE REALLY ARE.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.206
YEAH, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.642
TALK ABOUT STRONG...

09:01.674 --> 09:03.043
APRIL'S BACK.

09:03.076 --> 09:06.613
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT TODAY?

09:06.647 --> 09:08.048
NO, I THINK I'M OKAY.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.650
WHAT ABOUT YOU, CARLY?

09:10.683 --> 09:13.653
ANY OTHER THOUGHTS
OR QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP?

09:13.687 --> 09:15.721
UH... YEAH.

09:15.755 --> 09:18.991
I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOU GUYS
DO ABOUT TELLING PEOPLE?

09:19.025 --> 09:22.296
(voice fading) DID YOU
JUST UPDATE YOUR STATUS
THAT YOU HAD CANCER?

09:25.698 --> 09:27.967

BECAUSE I WOULD TOTALLY
BUY YOU ONE.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.905
I DON'T THINK
THOSE WOULD GO OVER
TOO GREAT AT PUBLIC SCHOOL.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.640
WHAT ABOUT AT CHARTON?

10:41.674 --> 10:44.644
IF YOU WANTED TO REENROLL,
I'D BE HAPPY TO HELP.

10:44.677 --> 10:47.681
WOW.
THANK YOU.

10:47.713 --> 10:52.085
UM, BUT I ALREADY MADE
MY DRAMATIC EXIT FROM CHARTON.

10:52.119 --> 10:55.087
IT WOULD BE WEIRD GOING BACK.

10:55.121 --> 10:59.192
OKAY. WELL, I HAVE
ALL THIS MONEY NOW,
SO IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.

10:59.225 --> 11:02.428
-HI!
-HI.

11:02.662 --> 11:06.133
HEY, APRIL'S HAVING DINNER
WITH US. GREAT.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.368
SO HOW WAS SUPPORT GROUP?

11:08.402 --> 11:10.770
IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME.

11:10.803 --> 11:13.740
JUST FELT LIKE PEOPLE
WERE SITTING AROUND,
SPOUTING OFF

11:13.774 --> 11:16.676
THINGS THEY WROTE
ON MOTIVATIONAL POSTERS.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.677
THAT'S A SHAME.

11:18.711 --> 11:21.715
WELL, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY
GROUP THERAPY.

11:21.748 --> 11:23.783
IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT
FROM SUPPORT GROUP.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.818
THEY HAVE A LEADER,
AND SOME OF MY CLIENTS--

11:25.851 --> 11:27.320
THEY DON'T HAVE THAT
AT THE NORTH END HEALTH CENTER.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.423
April:
IT'S FINE, MOM.
I TRIED.

11:29.456 --> 11:32.793
11:05 PM. SOUTH STATION. GOT IT.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.729
YEAH. WAIT, WHAT?

11:35.761 --> 11:37.798
YES, I'M WRITING IT DOWN.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.131
YEAH. OKAY.

11:39.165 --> 11:41.467
ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.736
-ALL RIGHT. BYE, MAE.
-EVERYTHING COOL?

11:43.769 --> 11:45.072
YEAH. EVERYTHING'S FINE.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.307
I'M JUST COORDINATING
MAE'S TRAVEL TO BOSTON.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.176
HER CONFERENCE
IN NEW YORK IS GOING GREAT.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.044
ARE YOU GUYS SURE IT'S OKAY
IF SHE STAYS HERE?

11:52.078 --> 11:57.149
-IT'S MY LAST NIGHT IN TOWN
AND I DON'T WANNA FIND HER--
-YEAH. OF COURSE.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.852
WOW. JUDGING
FROM ALL THIS FOOD,

11:59.885 --> 12:02.188
LOOKS LIKE I BETTER GO
PUT ON SOME SWEATS.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.424
HOW YOU DOING, KID?

12:05.458 --> 12:06.826
GOOD.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.360
I'M FEELING BETTER. THANKS.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.297
OKAY.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.465
WE'RE GONNA
MISS YOU, UNCLE GEORGE.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.500
WELL, I WILL BE BACK.

12:13.732 --> 12:17.504
ACTUALLY, COULD YOU DO
ME A FAVOR BEFORE YOU GO?

12:17.736 --> 12:19.905
A FRIEND FROM SCHOOL
HAS LYMPHOMA

12:19.940 --> 12:23.009
AND HE HAD A TRANSPLANT
A FEW MONTHS AGO,

12:23.043 --> 12:25.778
BUT NOW HE HAS
GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE

12:25.812 --> 12:28.248
AND NONE OF THE MEDS
THAT HIS DOCTORS ARE GIVING
HIM ARE WORKING.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.384
SO, SINCE YOU'RE...

12:31.418 --> 12:34.019
LIKE, THE BEST PEDIATRIC
ONCOLOGIST IN THE WORLD...

12:34.053 --> 12:36.222
-YEAH...
-MAYBE YOU COULD HELP HIM?

12:36.255 --> 12:39.259
I APPRECIATE YOU
PUTTING "IN THE WORLD" THERE,

12:39.292 --> 12:40.860
BUT NO NEED.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.028
I SPECIALIZE
IN GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST,

12:42.062 --> 12:43.797
SO I'LL DEFINITELY TAKE
A LOOK AT YOUR FRIEND,

12:43.830 --> 12:44.865
SO DON'T WORRY.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.832
WE'RE GONNA
FIGURE EVERYTHING OUT.

12:46.866 --> 12:48.768
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

13:25.538 --> 13:28.508
OH, I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU WERE IN HERE.

13:28.542 --> 13:30.243
HEY, BRENN.

13:32.278 --> 13:34.914
-SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT FINN.
-THANKS...

13:34.947 --> 13:37.850
BUT I'VE BEEN READING
ABOUT GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST,

13:37.884 --> 13:39.919
AND AS LONG AS
IT'S TREATED RIGHT,

13:39.952 --> 13:42.022
-HE SHOULD BE FINE.
-HOPEFULLY.

13:42.054 --> 13:43.856
WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT WE BOTH

13:43.889 --> 13:46.259
DATE GUYS WITH CANCER?

13:46.293 --> 13:48.128
WELL, FINN AND I
AREN'T DATING.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.197
'CAUSE IF FINN DIES,
THEN ALL THREE CARVER WOMEN

13:50.230 --> 13:51.932
WOULD OFFICIALLY
BE BLACK WIDOWS.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.466
MOVE OVER, SCARJO.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.905
EVERYONE HAVING FUN?

13:59.940 --> 14:01.341
YES, APRIL.
FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME,

14:01.374 --> 14:03.210
-WE'RE HAVING FUN.
-WELL, I'M JUST MAKING SURE.

14:03.243 --> 14:04.610
DOES ANYBODY NEED REFILLS

14:04.844 --> 14:06.011
OR MORE APPETIZERS?

14:06.046 --> 14:07.279
I COULD GO FOR
SOME MOZZARELLA STICKS.

14:07.313 --> 14:08.881
I REALLY LOVE MOZZARELLA STICKS.

14:08.914 --> 14:10.583
SOMETIMES I THINK I LOVE
THEM MORE THAN I LOVE SEX.

14:10.616 --> 14:12.384
-THAT'S PSYCHOTIC.
-OH, YOU'RE INSANE.

14:12.418 --> 14:14.486
Beth:
NO. I GET IT, GUPTA.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.190
I'VE HAD BAD SEX,
BUT I'VE NEVER HAD
A BAD MOZZARELLA STICK.

14:19.458 --> 14:20.594
HOW WOULD YOU COMPARE

14:20.626 --> 14:23.196
YOUR NEW LOVER, JOSH,
TO CHEESE STICKS?

14:23.230 --> 14:24.397
AND LIKE,
WHY ISN'T HE HERE?

14:24.431 --> 14:25.498
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT HIM NONSTOP.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.500
SO HOW YOU
HOLDING UP, APRIL?

14:27.533 --> 14:31.538
WELL, I'M A 25-YEAR-OLD
WIDOW WITH CANCER,

14:31.571 --> 14:33.639
BUT SURPRISINGLY,
I'M NOT SO BAD.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.610
YOU KNOW, HOW CAN I BE WHEN
I'M SURROUNDED BY MY FRIENDS?

14:36.643 --> 14:38.311
THAT'S REALLY GOOD TO HEAR.

14:38.345 --> 14:39.479
NOW, LET'S GET DOWN
TO BUSINESS.

14:39.511 --> 14:40.547
HOW MUCH MONEY DID YOU GET?

14:40.580 --> 14:42.349
-DANNY, COME ON.
-WHAT?

14:42.381 --> 14:44.049
I'M NEW MONEY,
I MINORED IN ECONOMICS.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.418
-LET ME BE GAUCHE.
-IN THE WORDS OF SALT 'N PEPA,

14:46.452 --> 14:47.586
"NONE OF YO BUSINESS."

14:47.620 --> 14:49.121
-OH...
-(laughter)

14:49.154 --> 14:51.524
BUT I WANT TO SHARE
THE WEALTH WITH MY GOOD FRIENDS.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.493
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN
THE ABSOLUTE BEST LATELY

14:53.525 --> 14:56.596
AND AS A THANK YOU,
I THINK WE SHOULD
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.298
IT MAKES ME HAPPY
FOR OTHERS TO JOIN IN
ON THE FUN,

14:59.331 --> 15:01.967
AND IT'S DEFINITELY
WHAT LEO WOULD WANT.

15:02.001 --> 15:05.504
SO, ALONG WITH TWO ORDERS
OF MOZZARELLA STICKS...

15:05.538 --> 15:08.575
WHAT IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST
BOOZE THIS PLACE HAS
ON THE MENU?

15:08.607 --> 15:11.110
I BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE
A BOTTLE OF CRISTAL.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.178
BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE,
NO ONE IN THE HISTORY

15:13.212 --> 15:14.681
OF THE CHARLES
HAS EVER ORDERED ONE.

15:14.913 --> 15:17.182
LOOKS LIKE
THAT'S GONNA CHANGE TONIGHT.

I DON'T WANNA GO HOME YET.

16:04.563 --> 16:08.668
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT IS 1:45
AND WE SHOULD PROBABLY--

16:08.701 --> 16:11.638
DO YOU GUYS WANT
THIS PARTY TO END?

16:11.671 --> 16:14.206
-All: NO, NO.
-April: GOOD.

16:14.240 --> 16:17.177
I'M GONNA GO TALK
TO THE BARTENDER.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.411
OH, BE CAREFUL.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.046
THAT'S CHRIS. HE'S A DOUCHE.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.514
-HI!
-CLOSING OUT?

16:21.548 --> 16:22.649
WHAT'S YOUR LAST NAME?

16:22.682 --> 16:24.683
NO. ACTUALLY, I HAVE A REQUEST.

16:24.717 --> 16:27.019
MY FRIENDS AND I ARE
HAVING SUCH A GOOD TIME

16:27.052 --> 16:28.654
AND WE'RE NOT READY FOR
THE NIGHT TO BE OVER JUST YET.

16:28.687 --> 16:31.557
IS THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN STAY
OPEN JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER?

16:31.591 --> 16:33.293
OH, NICE TRY, BUT NO CAN DO.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.594
April:
PRETTY PLEASE?

16:34.626 --> 16:36.196
SORRY.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.730
(whispers)
MONEY.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.336
IN EXCHANGE
FOR YOUR TROUBLES,
HOW MUCH--

16:44.370 --> 16:45.605
PUT YOUR WALLET AWAY,
TWIGGY.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.506
WE CLOSE AT 2:00.
IT'S A STRICT RULE

16:47.539 --> 16:48.774
AND I AIN'T BENDING IT FOR YOU.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.110
OKAY.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.577
WELL, CAN I TALK TO THE OWNER?

16:51.610 --> 16:53.178
-MAYBE HE OR SHE--
-I AM THE OWNER.

16:53.212 --> 16:55.548
April:
LOOK, I'M A VERY LOYAL CUSTOMER

16:55.581 --> 16:57.649
AND I COME HERE
ALL THE TIME.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.219
DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?

16:59.251 --> 17:01.653
AND I BOUGHT TWO BOTTLES
OF CRISTAL TONIGHT!

17:01.687 --> 17:03.490
-IS THERE NOTHING YOU CAN DO?
-NO, THERE'S NOT.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.025
-SO CLOSE OUT AND GET OUT.
AND I'M NOT SAYING IT AGAIN.
-IT'S OKAY.

17:06.058 --> 17:08.627
-WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, DUDE?
YOU'RE BEING VERY RUDE.
-(laughs)

17:08.661 --> 17:09.762
-LET'S JUST GO.
-NO, NO.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.564
I'M TALKING
TO MR. CHARLES HIMSELF HERE

17:11.597 --> 17:15.167
-AND MIGHT I SAY,
HE'S A BIT OF AN ASS--
-OKAY. LET'S GO.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.636
NO! I'M NEVER COMING BACK HERE
AGAIN AND I'M GONNA TELL

17:17.670 --> 17:19.471
ALL MY FRIENDS NEVER
TO COME BACK HERE AGAIN.

17:19.506 --> 17:22.174
THE CHARLES IS OVER!

17:22.208 --> 17:24.510
-I'M SO SORRY.
-Dominic: I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW.

17:38.758 --> 17:39.826
MORNING.

17:42.127 --> 17:43.328
MORNING.

17:43.363 --> 17:46.165
SO, LAST NIGHT WAS INTERESTING.

17:47.500 --> 17:48.601
IT WAS.

17:48.634 --> 17:50.769
HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

17:50.804 --> 17:54.641
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU'RE NOT,
LIKE, OKAY-OKAY, BUT...

17:54.673 --> 17:56.276
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

17:56.308 --> 17:58.811
THE SPENDING, THE OUTBURSTS...

17:58.845 --> 18:00.680
-IS THERE ANYTHING THAT--
-NO, BETH.

18:00.712 --> 18:02.615
YOU KNOW LAST NIGHT
WAS EXTREMELY

18:02.648 --> 18:04.150
OUT OF CHARACTER FOR ME.

18:04.183 --> 18:05.351
I MEAN...

18:06.653 --> 18:08.488
EVERYTHING'S JUST BEEN SO HARD.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.256
I HAVEN'T BEEN
FEELING LIKE MYSELF.

18:10.289 --> 18:12.692
I GOT TOO DRUNK AND...

18:12.724 --> 18:15.627
HONESTLY, I DIDN'T
WANT THE NIGHT TO END.

18:20.232 --> 18:21.567
WELL...

18:21.601 --> 18:23.603
I GUESS YOU'RE ALLOWED
SOME, YOU KNOW,

18:23.635 --> 18:25.637
UNCHARACTERISTIC ACTIONS,
EVEN IF THAT MEANS

18:25.672 --> 18:28.775
WE CAN'T GO BACK
TO THE CHARLES ANYTIME SOON.

18:29.808 --> 18:32.644
-UGH. I'M SORRY.
-(laughs)

18:32.679 --> 18:34.614
(both laughing)

18:34.646 --> 18:37.717
HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY WE JUST DO
SOMETHING LOW-KEY TONIGHT?

18:37.750 --> 18:39.719
YOU KNOW, TAKE OUT
FROM ANNA'S TAQUERIA

18:39.751 --> 18:41.788
BETTE MIDLER
MOVIE MARATHON?

18:41.820 --> 18:43.722
NO  BEACHES .

18:43.756 --> 18:45.191
NO  BEACHES .

18:50.829 --> 18:54.366
George:
OKAY. I SPOKE WITH YOUR DOCTOR
AND AGREE THAT IT WAS

18:54.400 --> 18:56.702
WISE TO PRESCRIBE STEROIDS
WHILE YOU'RE ALSO ON TAC.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.904
THEY'RE USUALLY RELIABLE,
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE

18:59.137 --> 19:01.641
YOUR BODY IS NOT RESPONDING
THE WAY IT SHOULD.

19:01.673 --> 19:02.741
WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

19:02.775 --> 19:04.911
MY BODY JUST LOVES TO GO ROGUE.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.714
ALL RIGHT. WELL, WE'RE GONNA
TRY YOU ON SIROLIMUS.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.750
IT'S A BIT MORE POTENT
AND SLIGHTLY OUT OF THE BOX
IN THE REALM

19:11.784 --> 19:13.920
OF GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST
DISEASE TREATMENT.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.221
BUT I'VE HAD PATIENTS
WHO HAVE DONE VERY WELL ON IT.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.690
THANK YOU SO MUCH, DR. CARVER.

19:17.723 --> 19:20.326
-SURE.
-CALL HIM GEORGE.

19:20.359 --> 19:22.362
NOT TO GET AHEAD
OF OURSELVES, BUT...

19:22.394 --> 19:24.730
I'M GONNA HAVE TO TALK
TO YOUR DAD ABOUT THIS, FINN.

19:24.763 --> 19:26.766
I DON'T KNOW
IF WE CAN AFFORD IT ALL.

19:26.798 --> 19:27.901
George:
UM...

19:27.933 --> 19:30.737
THIS VISIT IS ON
THE HOUSE, MRS. MADILL.

19:30.769 --> 19:32.872
THE DRUG SHOULD BE COVERED
BY YOUR INSURANCE PLAN

19:32.905 --> 19:34.473
AND IF IT'S NOT,

19:34.507 --> 19:36.476
CALL ME AND WE'LL WORK
SOMETHING OUT.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.443
-Kid: GIVE IT BACK!
-(glass shatters)

19:38.478 --> 19:40.579
-Kid: I'M GONNA TELL!
-(sighs) I GOTTA GO
CHECK ON THE BOYS.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.382
-George: MRS.--
-THANK YOU.

19:45.518 --> 19:48.654
OKAY. THE MEDICATION SHOULD
KICK IN IN ABOUT THREE DAYS.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.223
I'M GUESSING THAT MEANS
NO PUBLIC OUTINGS ANY TIME SOON?

19:51.257 --> 19:53.425
NO. NOT UNTIL
THE SYMPTOMS SUBSIDE.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.595
DAMN. SORRY, BRENNA.

19:55.627 --> 19:58.698
DID YOU END UP INVITING
ANYONE TO THAT SHOWCASE?

19:58.730 --> 19:59.965
HOW ABOUT ANDREW AND TJ?

20:00.199 --> 20:01.733
I'M SURE THEY'D
BE INTO AUTEUR FILMS.

20:01.768 --> 20:02.868
(scoffs)

20:02.902 --> 20:05.605
IT'S NOT PRETENTIOUS ENOUGH
FOR ANDREW

20:05.637 --> 20:07.272
AND NOT DUMB ENOUGH
FOR TJ,

20:07.307 --> 20:08.540
-SO...
-OH.

20:08.575 --> 20:09.709
Brenna:
IT'S FINE. I'LL JUST--
I'LL GO ALONE.

20:09.741 --> 20:11.778
WAIT, SORRY.
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT A SHOWCASE?

20:11.810 --> 20:12.744
IT'S NOTHING.

20:12.778 --> 20:14.681
Finn:
SHE'S BEING MODEST.

20:14.713 --> 20:15.882
HER SHORT FILM IS DEBUTING

20:15.914 --> 20:17.482
AT THE SCREENING
AT NORTHEASTERN.

20:17.517 --> 20:18.785
THERE'S EVEN A Q&A AFTERWARDS.

20:18.817 --> 20:20.752
YOUR FIRST MOVIE PREMIERE?

20:20.787 --> 20:23.890
-THAT'S HUGE.
-I KNOW. I KEEP SAYING THAT.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.758
ANYONE COULD HAVE GOTTEN IN.

20:25.791 --> 20:27.660
REALLY. IT'S WHATEVER.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.597
WELL, YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN
WANTING TO EXPAND,

20:31.631 --> 20:33.499
START WORKING WITH PEOPLE
WHO ARE DEALING WITH MORE

20:33.532 --> 20:36.935
DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES AND,
YOU KNOW, REALLY NEED MY HELP.

20:36.970 --> 20:38.770
SO YOU DON'T MIND?

20:38.805 --> 20:40.472
NOT AT ALL.

20:40.506 --> 20:42.674
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAYBE...

20:42.709 --> 20:44.810
MAYBE GROUP THERAPY
IS A BETTER ALTERNATIVE

20:44.844 --> 20:46.546
THAN SUPPORT GROUP.
I DON'T KNOW.

20:46.578 --> 20:47.713
OKAY. GOOD.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.449
BECAUSE I ALREADY
SPOKE TO SHIREEN

20:49.481 --> 20:50.750
AT THE NORTH END HEALTH CENTER.

20:50.782 --> 20:52.518
-OF COURSE YOU DID.
-AND I'D LOVE YOU TO CONSIDER

20:52.551 --> 20:54.621
COMING TO THE FIRST
SESSION I'M LEADING.

20:54.653 --> 20:55.922
IT MIGHT BE USEFUL.

20:55.954 --> 20:58.458
PLUS, IT'D BE A WAY FOR US
TO SPEND SOME TIME TOGETHER.

20:58.490 --> 20:59.525
I MISS YOU.

20:59.558 --> 21:02.028
I MISS YOU, TOO,
BUT I REALLY NEED TO GO.

21:02.260 --> 21:04.463
OH. WELL, YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO GO

21:04.497 --> 21:05.932
WITH YOU TO
YOUR APPOINTMENT TODAY?

21:05.964 --> 21:08.768
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET USED TO
DOING THESE THINGS ON MY OWN.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.305
OH. OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

21:12.337 --> 21:13.439
(door closes)

21:13.472 --> 21:15.407
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

21:18.644 --> 21:21.980
SO, HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING
WITH THE INJECTION PROCESS?

21:22.015 --> 21:23.415
GOOD.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.518
I MEAN, IT'LL TAKE SOME
TIME GETTING USED TO.

21:25.550 --> 21:27.720
WELL, YOU'LL BE
A PRO IN NO TIME.

21:27.753 --> 21:29.922
HOW ARE YOU FEELING OTHERWISE?

21:29.955 --> 21:32.759
UM... I'M NOT FEELING GREAT.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.693
WHAT? ARE YOU NAUSEOUS?
LIGHT-HEADED?

21:34.727 --> 21:36.061
NO, NO. NOTHING LIKE THAT.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.630
IT'S JUST...

21:37.663 --> 21:39.632
HAVEN'T BEEN
FEELING LIKE MYSELF.

21:39.665 --> 21:41.701
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S PERSONAL STUFF

21:41.733 --> 21:44.369
OR THE CANCER
OR MAYBE THE DRUGS,

21:44.403 --> 21:46.873
BUT... LAST NIGHT,
I KIND OF ACTED WEIRD.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.676
WELL, THE STEROIDS
CAN ALTER YOUR MOOD

21:50.710 --> 21:52.577
AND INCREASE YOUR APPETITE.

21:52.612 --> 21:55.314
I DID EAT, LIKE,
TEN MOZZARELLA
STICKS LAST NIGHT.

21:55.347 --> 21:56.348
WELL, HOW CAN YOU NOT?

21:56.382 --> 21:57.884
MOZZARELLA STICKS ARE THE BEST.

21:57.916 --> 22:00.752
BUT IT IS A LITTLE UNUSUAL
FOR THE DRUGS TO HAVE

22:00.787 --> 22:02.855
SUCH STRONG EFFECTS SO QUICKLY.

22:02.888 --> 22:05.657
SO, WHY DON'T WE TAKE
YOU OFF THE STEROIDS,

22:05.692 --> 22:06.759
SEE HOW YOU FEEL.

22:06.792 --> 22:07.926
I MEAN, THEY'RE MAINLY
JUST TO KEEP

22:07.960 --> 22:10.630
THE OTHER DRUG SIDE EFFECTS
AT BAY.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.664
IF YOU START TO FEEL SICK,
WE'LL PUT YOU BACK ON THEM.

22:12.699 --> 22:13.833
SOUND GOOD?

22:13.865 --> 22:15.768
I'LL TRY ANYTHING.

22:50.769 --> 22:53.072
-HEY.
-HEY.

22:53.105 --> 22:55.942
IS THAT A NEW HEAVY DUTY
CANCER MASK OR--

22:55.974 --> 22:58.611
NO. THAT IS
MY MOTORCYCLE HELMET.

22:58.644 --> 22:59.912
APRIL CARVER RODE
A MOTORCYCLE?

22:59.945 --> 23:01.446
MM-HMM.

23:01.480 --> 23:05.417
APRIL CARVER, WHO HAS CANCER,
RODE A MOTORCYCLE?

23:05.451 --> 23:07.019
YEAH. WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

23:10.088 --> 23:13.692
OH! SO THE REASON I WENT
ALL KIND OF WEIRD LAST NIGHT

23:13.726 --> 23:14.861
WAS BECAUSE OF THE STEROIDS

23:14.894 --> 23:17.130
THEY HAD ME ON
FOR THE NEW CLINICAL TRIAL.

23:17.163 --> 23:19.164
-I'M OFF THEM NOW.
EVERYTHING'S GOOD.
-GREAT.

23:19.397 --> 23:21.933
OKAY, MOVIE TIME.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.702
I'M THINKING WE SHOULD
START WITH  BIG BUSINESS .

23:23.736 --> 23:25.704
YOU KNOW, BETTE'S OUTFITS
ARE TO DIE FOR.

23:25.738 --> 23:26.705
AND LILY TOMLIN?

23:26.739 --> 23:29.442
OH, MY GOD.
A COMEDIC GENIUS.

23:29.474 --> 23:30.777
YOU KNOW, I DON'T--

23:30.809 --> 23:32.177
I'M NOT SURE I WANNA
WATCH A MOVIE TONIGHT.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.180
FRIENDS  THANKSGIVING EPISODES?

23:34.413 --> 23:35.781
ACTUALLY, I JUST...

23:35.815 --> 23:37.549
I DON'T WANNA STAY IN.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.652
COULD WE GO OUT?
LET'S GO OUT. LET'S GO DANCING.

23:39.684 --> 23:40.819
UH...

23:40.853 --> 23:42.521
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

23:42.555 --> 23:43.990
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
AFTER LAST NIGHT...

23:44.022 --> 23:45.958
-IT MIGHT BE BETTER
TO JUST TAKE IT EASY.
-NO.

23:45.991 --> 23:48.193
TAKING IT EASY IS EXACTLY
WHAT I DON'T WANT

23:48.426 --> 23:49.828
TO BE DOING RIGHT NOW.
I WANT...

23:49.862 --> 23:53.065
I WANT TO BE SURROUNDED
BY PEOPLE JUST DOING SOMETHING.

23:53.098 --> 23:55.433
-ANYTHING.
-AND YOU'RE OFF THE STEROIDS?

23:55.468 --> 23:56.635
YEAH, BUT THAT'S
NOT EVEN THE POINT.

23:56.669 --> 23:57.903
I JUST-- I WANNA
GET OUT OF HERE.

23:57.936 --> 24:00.071
I HAVE ALL THIS MONEY NOW
AND THE WORLD IS OURS.

24:00.105 --> 24:01.874
YOU KNOW, I HAVE AN IDEA.

24:01.907 --> 24:03.209
LET'S TAKE OUT THE MOTORCYCLE.

24:03.442 --> 24:07.579
OKAY, YOU'RE OFFICIALLY
ACTING LIKE A CRAZY PERSON.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.781
WHY? 'CAUSE I WANT
TO RIDE MY MOTORCYCLE?

24:09.816 --> 24:12.951
-YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A LICENSE.
-LEO TAUGHT ME THE BASICS.

24:16.855 --> 24:18.691
LOOK, I'M JUST TRYING
TO DO WHATEVER I CAN

24:18.723 --> 24:20.125
TO MAKE MYSELF HAPPY
AND FEEL BETTER.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.493
AND THIS IS
WHAT I WANT TO DO.

24:21.527 --> 24:23.028
WHY CAN'T YOU GET THAT?

24:26.499 --> 24:27.732
APRIL...

24:30.236 --> 24:31.737
I HAVE BEEN TRYING
TO KEEP YOU BUSY

24:31.770 --> 24:32.971
THESE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS

24:33.005 --> 24:35.607
AND BE THERE FOR YOU, BUT...

24:35.641 --> 24:37.542
YOU'RE LIKE, REALLY OUT THERE.

24:37.576 --> 24:40.046
OKAY? AND I'M SORRY
TO SAY THIS, BUT...

24:40.078 --> 24:42.480
YOU CAN'T LIVE
LIKE THIS FOREVER.

24:42.515 --> 24:44.182
SOMEDAY YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GET OVER IT.

24:46.051 --> 24:47.886
GET OVER MY DEAD HUSBAND?

24:49.055 --> 24:50.088
REALLY? WOW.

24:50.122 --> 24:52.557
GOD, BETH.
YOU... YOU NAILED IT.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.693
WHY THE HELL HADN'T
I THOUGHT OF THAT?

25:01.701 --> 25:04.170
(rock music playing)

25:04.202 --> 25:07.874
(lively chattering)

25:13.880 --> 25:16.249
HEY, DRINK MORE.
I BOUGHT YOU ANOTHER ONE.

25:16.281 --> 25:18.683
-MM.
-THERE WE GO.

25:21.653 --> 25:23.154
ALL RIGHT, LIKE, WE DON'T
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT

25:23.189 --> 25:25.156
OR ANYTHING, BUT I JUST...

25:25.191 --> 25:26.692
WANTED TO SAY
I'M SORRY ABOUT LEO.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.560
THANKS.

25:28.594 --> 25:30.596
BUT I SEE
YOU'RE TRYING NEW THINGS.

25:30.630 --> 25:33.865
-YEAH.
-WHICH I UNDERSTAND.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.234
WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH,
YOU GO OUTSIDE
YOUR COMFORT ZONE.

25:36.269 --> 25:39.070
I GUESS YOU'RE MORE OF A BAD-ASS
THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

25:39.105 --> 25:40.873
BUT I AM CLEARLY
MORE OF A BAD-ASS.

25:40.906 --> 25:42.307
-CLEARLY.
-THANK YOU.

25:42.540 --> 25:44.542
THOUGH I AM STARTING
TO UNDERSTAND WHY

25:44.576 --> 25:46.746
YOU CAN SOMETIMES
BE THE WAY YOU ARE.

25:46.778 --> 25:48.914
-OH, LIKE A BITCH?
-I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

25:48.948 --> 25:51.116
OKAY. I AM A BITCH.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.751
BLAME THE CANCER.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.720
BEFORE THAT,
I WAS WEAK AND MISERABLE.

25:54.753 --> 25:55.688
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.957
I WAS VERY DIFFERENT.

25:57.990 --> 26:01.626
I HAD A SKETCHY BOYFRIEND
AND AN EMOTIONALLY DRAINING JOB

26:01.661 --> 26:04.630
AND I LIVED WITH MY NEEDY MOM

26:04.663 --> 26:06.265
WHO I WAS CONSTANTLY
FIGHTING WITH.

26:06.298 --> 26:09.101
SO WHEN I WAS DIAGNOSED,
I DECIDED TO MAKE

26:09.134 --> 26:12.305
THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY
IN MY LIFE... ME.

26:12.337 --> 26:14.339
-NOT A BAD PRIORITY.
-MM-HMM.

26:14.573 --> 26:15.942
YEAH, I DUMPED THE BOYFRIEND,
QUIT THE JOB,

26:15.974 --> 26:17.609
AND AS SOON
AS I WAS WELL ENOUGH,

26:17.643 --> 26:19.077
I MOVED OUT.

26:19.111 --> 26:22.114
I JUST HAD TO DO
WHAT I REALLY WANTED.

26:22.147 --> 26:24.616
HOW DID THAT FEEL?

26:24.650 --> 26:26.117
(laughs)
IT WAS A PROCESS.

26:26.152 --> 26:28.153
I WENT THROUGH A LOT OF PHASES.

26:28.186 --> 26:30.823
I BECAME SPIRITUAL...

26:30.855 --> 26:33.792
(laughs)
AND I WAS A DRUGGIE.

26:33.826 --> 26:35.927
-HMM.
-MOSTLY HALLUCINOGENS.

26:35.961 --> 26:39.164
BUT... (sighs) MUSHROOMS.

26:39.198 --> 26:40.700
(both laugh)

26:40.732 --> 26:41.968
AND A WORLD TRAVELER.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.271
I'VE BEEN SO MANY DIFFERENT
PEOPLE SINCE I GOT SICK.

26:46.305 --> 26:48.773
AND I'VE EXPERIENCED
SO MANY THINGS

26:48.807 --> 26:51.143
I WOULDN'T HAVE,
AND THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

26:51.176 --> 26:55.314
WHICH IS SO WEIRD
'CAUSE LIKE, I HAD TO...

26:55.347 --> 26:57.817
GET CANCER TO BE HAPPY. IT'S...

26:57.849 --> 26:59.384
I'M JEALOUS.

26:59.617 --> 27:01.386
I'D KILL TO BE HAPPY AGAIN.

27:01.619 --> 27:03.288
LIKE THAT GUY.

27:03.321 --> 27:05.857
I MEAN, HE LOOKS LIKE
HE DOESN'T HAVE CARE
IN THE WORLD.

27:05.891 --> 27:08.994
OH. THAT'S PROBABLY
BECAUSE HE'S ROLLING.

27:09.028 --> 27:12.832
-HMM?
-ON ECSTASY, YOU NERD.

27:12.865 --> 27:14.133
(laughs)

27:16.868 --> 27:17.903
IS THERE ANY DANGER

27:17.936 --> 27:21.007
IN DOING ECSTASY
IF YOU HAVE CANCER?

27:21.039 --> 27:23.209
IF THERE WERE,
I'D PROBABLY BE DEAD.

27:24.977 --> 27:29.848
♪ LOVE IS STILL A MAGIC AFFAIR ♪

27:29.882 --> 27:32.050
♪ MY DEAR ♪

27:41.760 --> 27:42.761
AND NOW, I'D LIKE
TO OPEN THE FLOOR

27:42.795 --> 27:44.262
TO QUESTIONS
FOR BRENNA CARVER,

27:44.296 --> 27:46.766
THE WRITER AND DIRECTOR
OF  ME, YOU, AND NIGEL.

27:56.776 --> 27:57.910
AH, YES. YOU, SIR.

27:59.045 --> 28:01.814
HI, UM...

28:01.846 --> 28:03.115
LOVE THE MOVIE.

28:03.148 --> 28:04.250
WHAT AN ENDING.

28:04.282 --> 28:05.917
UM... I THOUGHT YOU MADE SOME

28:05.951 --> 28:09.154
REALLY INTERESTING CHOICES
AS A DIRECTOR.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.089
COULD YOU JUST TELL US MORE
ABOUT WHAT INSPIRED

28:11.123 --> 28:13.392
YOU TO MAKE THIS SHORT FILM?

28:13.425 --> 28:15.394
THANKS. UM...

28:15.428 --> 28:20.465
WELL, I WAS REALLY INFLUENCED
BY THE WORKS OF JEAN-LUC GODARD,

28:20.699 --> 28:23.469
INGMAR BERGMAN
AND AMY HECKERLING...

28:25.971 --> 28:27.239
(knocking)

28:30.009 --> 28:31.309
HEY.

28:31.343 --> 28:32.811
HEY, SARA.

28:32.845 --> 28:34.747
UM... IS APRIL HOME?

28:34.779 --> 28:36.082
NO, SHE'S NOT.

28:36.115 --> 28:38.851
SHE TEXTED TO SAY
SHE WENT OUT WITH VANESSA.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.786
I ASSUMED YOU WERE WITH THEM.

28:42.188 --> 28:44.123
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

28:47.058 --> 28:48.827
COME ON IN.

28:50.863 --> 28:53.833
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'VE TRIED
BEING THERE FOR APRIL, BUT...

28:53.865 --> 28:55.101
I FEEL LIKE
I CAN'T LET HER...

28:55.134 --> 28:58.203
IN ON WHAT'S GOING ON
IN MY LIFE.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.838
WHY NOT?

28:59.872 --> 29:01.840
WELL, I FEEL TOO GUILTY.

29:01.874 --> 29:03.509
HOW CAN I TELL HER

29:03.741 --> 29:06.178
THAT JACLYN'S LETTING ME DESIGN
MY OWN COCKTAIL DRESS AT WORK

29:06.211 --> 29:08.079
WHEN SHE'S UNEMPLOYED?

29:08.114 --> 29:11.282
AND HOW CAN I TELL HER
THAT I'M TOTALLY FALLING

29:11.317 --> 29:15.753
FOR JOSH WHEN THE LOVE
OF HER LIFE JUST DIED?

29:15.788 --> 29:17.123
(sniffles)

29:18.990 --> 29:22.894
I GET THAT
YOU THINK TALKING TO APRIL

29:22.928 --> 29:25.431
ABOUT ALL THE GREAT THINGS
YOU HAVE GOING ON

29:25.463 --> 29:27.532
MIGHT COME OFF
AS INCONSIDERATE, BUT...

29:27.766 --> 29:30.502
YOU SHOULD NOT FEEL BAD

29:30.536 --> 29:32.037
ABOUT BEING EXCITED.

29:32.070 --> 29:33.905
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE A LIFE.

29:35.773 --> 29:38.777
YOU SURE I WOULDN'T SOUND
LIKE JUST SOME THOUGHTLESS JERK?

29:38.810 --> 29:40.145
NO!

29:40.179 --> 29:41.814
YOU DESERVE TO BE HAPPY

29:41.846 --> 29:44.782
AND APRIL WANTS
THAT FOR YOU.

29:44.817 --> 29:45.984
JUST LIKE YOU WERE HAPPY

29:46.018 --> 29:49.355
FOR HER WHEN SHE GOT
HER FIRST BYLINE, OR...

29:49.387 --> 29:51.789
YOU KNOW, WHEN
SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH LEO.

29:51.824 --> 29:54.492
FRIENDSHIPS ARE ABOUT
SUPPORTING ONE ANOTHER

29:54.527 --> 29:58.063
THROUGH THE GOOD TIMES
AN THE BAD, AND...

29:58.096 --> 30:00.231
EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN.

30:00.266 --> 30:01.333
(sighs)

30:01.366 --> 30:03.368
GEEZ. YOU ARE GOOD, SARA.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.837
DO YOU TAKE OBAMACARE?

30:05.871 --> 30:06.971
(laughs)

30:13.345 --> 30:14.913
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

30:14.946 --> 30:18.349
-I GOTTA ASK.
-OH, MY GOD. (laughs)

30:18.384 --> 30:20.219
HI.

30:20.251 --> 30:21.519
HEY, PRETTY PIXIE.

30:21.554 --> 30:24.088
OH, YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU COULD USE THIS.

30:25.356 --> 30:28.059
UM... YOU SEEM GENEROUS.

30:28.093 --> 30:31.462
PERHAPS YOU'D CARE
TO SHARE MORE?

30:31.497 --> 30:34.066
OH. OH, DAMN.
I WISH I COULD.

30:34.098 --> 30:35.201
I ONLY HAVE TWO LEFT
AND THEY NEED

30:35.233 --> 30:38.103
TO LAST ME FOR A WHILE.

30:38.136 --> 30:39.872
-I'M SO SORRY.
-UM...

30:39.904 --> 30:44.009
LET ME MAKE IT UP TO YOU...
AND YOU ARE REALLY SOFT.

30:44.042 --> 30:46.177
-HOW MUCH?
-NOT FOR SALE, SUNSHINE.

30:47.613 --> 30:48.948
$300 BUCKS?

30:50.883 --> 30:52.984
$300 FOR TWO ECSTASY TABS?

30:53.018 --> 30:54.118
YEAH.

30:54.153 --> 30:56.188
YOU'RE ON.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

30:56.221 --> 30:58.557
(laughs)

30:58.590 --> 31:00.058
(laughs)

31:04.462 --> 31:06.365
WOW.

31:06.397 --> 31:08.433
WHAT A MOVIE, BRENNA.

31:08.467 --> 31:10.035
SO IMPRESSIVE.

31:10.068 --> 31:12.904
JUST TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,
I'M NOT SURE WHAT KIND OF FUTURE

31:12.938 --> 31:14.038
FORD HAS AS AN ACTRESS.

31:14.073 --> 31:15.607
SHE'S NOT EXACTLY MERYL STREEP.

31:15.641 --> 31:19.912
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, NEPOTISM
IS A HUGE PROBLEM IN THE ARTS.

31:19.944 --> 31:21.247
(both laugh)

31:21.279 --> 31:22.513
AND I'M SORRY
IF YOU'RE MAD AT ME

31:22.548 --> 31:24.148
FOR COMING HERE UNANNOUNCED,
BUT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT

31:24.182 --> 31:25.416
NEED SOMEBODY
IN THE AUDIENCE.

31:25.451 --> 31:27.519
IT WAS NICE TO SEE
A FAMILIAR FACE.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.954
I WAS JUST
SO NERVOUS FOR TONIGHT.

31:29.989 --> 31:32.023
BUT IF YOU'RE SERIOUS
ABOUT BEING A FILMMAKER,

31:32.057 --> 31:33.157
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO LEARN

31:33.192 --> 31:36.095
TO PRESENT YOUR MOVIES
WITH PRIDE.

31:37.296 --> 31:41.500
-EVEN IF THEY MIGHT SUCK?
-WELL, YOU CAN'T REALLY
LOOK AT IT LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW?

31:41.532 --> 31:44.603
I'VE NOTICED IN SAN FRANCISCO
THAT ART IS... IS EVERYWHERE.

31:44.636 --> 31:47.605
EVERYBODY PUTS THEIR STUFF
OUT THERE WITH SUCH CONFIDENCE.

31:47.640 --> 31:50.909
WITHOUT ANY FEAR OF REJECTION
AND THAT'S JUST WHAT ARTISTS DO.

31:50.942 --> 31:54.078
YEAH, I GUESS I NEED
TO WORK ON THAT.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.615
IT APPLIES TO ANYTHING
THAT YOU WOULD PURSUE.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.549
I MEAN, I CANNOT EVEN TELL
YOU HOW NERVOUS I WAS

31:58.584 --> 32:01.185
RIGHT BEFORE FOR MY FIRST
MEDICAL PRESENTATION

32:01.220 --> 32:05.590
ON RHABDOMYOSARCOMA
AT THE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM

32:05.624 --> 32:07.625
FOR PEDIATRIC CANCER
IN DUBROVNIK.

32:07.660 --> 32:11.063
OKAY, THAT WAS NOT EVEN ENGLISH.

32:11.096 --> 32:12.096
(both laugh)

32:12.131 --> 32:13.665
BUT, UH...

32:13.699 --> 32:15.334
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

32:15.366 --> 32:16.701
YEAH.

32:16.934 --> 32:18.069
WELL YOU KNOW,
WE'VE GOT SOME TIME

32:18.103 --> 32:19.704
BEFORE I HAVE TO PICK UP
MAE FROM THE STATION,

32:19.938 --> 32:22.641
SO WHY DON'T WE GET
SOME ICE CREAM TO CELEBRATE?

32:22.674 --> 32:23.976
JP LICKS?

32:24.009 --> 32:25.144
SURE.

32:25.176 --> 32:26.545
OKAY.

32:26.577 --> 32:27.712
♪ I COULDN'T FAKE IT ♪

32:27.945 --> 32:29.213
♪ NO, I COULDN'T MAKE IT ♪

32:29.248 --> 32:31.717

32:42.728 --> 32:44.563
-MM.
-MM.

32:44.596 --> 32:46.230
YOUR HEAD FEELS LIKE
THE INSIDE OF AN UGG BOOT.

32:46.265 --> 32:49.134
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

32:49.167 --> 32:53.105
WHY? IT FEELS SO INCREDIBLE.

32:53.137 --> 32:54.573
-OH, WOW.
-IT'S LIKE...

32:54.605 --> 32:57.375
IT'S LIKE PURE ECSTASY.

32:57.409 --> 32:58.676
OH WELL.

32:58.711 --> 33:00.712
OH, MY GOD...

33:00.746 --> 33:02.448
I DID ECSTASY.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.615
(laughs)

33:03.648 --> 33:05.517
YEAH.

33:05.550 --> 33:08.186
-ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT THE OTHER PILL?
-YES. YES.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.756
LIKE I SAID, AMPHETAMINES
ARE SO 2012 FOR ME.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.758
OH, MY GOD. YOUR LOSS.

33:12.990 --> 33:15.426
I'VE NEVER FELT THIS GOOD
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

33:16.994 --> 33:18.564
I FEEL HAPPY.

33:18.596 --> 33:22.166
IT HURTS TO SMILE,
I MEAN, IT FEELS LIKE-- (gasps)

33:22.201 --> 33:23.469
AM I A DRUGGIE NOW?

33:23.501 --> 33:24.702
UH, HARDLY.

33:24.737 --> 33:27.205
HEY LOOK, MY CANCER
IS MAKING ME SUPER TIRED.

33:27.239 --> 33:29.741
MINE'S NOT.
I'M GONNA STAY UP ALL NIGHT.

33:29.775 --> 33:32.510
-AND WE'RE TWIRLING AGAIN.
-YEP.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.249
-HEY, HEY.
-Vanessa: HI.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.419
JUST LET ME BARGE
ON IN HERE.

33:40.451 --> 33:42.587
YOU GOOD?
WELL, THANK YOU

33:42.621 --> 33:46.057
FOR LETTING ME DROP OFF
APRIL'S ECSTASY-IMPAIRED ASS.

33:46.090 --> 33:48.093
SHE DID NOT WANT
TO GO TO BETH'S.

33:48.126 --> 33:50.328
YEAH, AND I CAN'T GO HOME.

33:50.362 --> 33:51.763
MY MOM WOULD BE
SO DISAPPOINTED

33:51.797 --> 33:53.132
IF SHE SAW ME LIKE THIS.

33:53.164 --> 33:54.665
WANT ME TO TEXT HER
THAT YOU'RE CRASHING HERE?

33:56.634 --> 33:58.403
YES. YES.

33:58.436 --> 34:02.340
SHE WOULD TOTALLY KNOW
THAT I WAS HIGH IF I TEXTED HER.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.143
I'LL START MAKING
UP THE COUCH, TOO.

34:04.175 --> 34:07.479
OKAY, I'M OUT,
BUT FUN TIMES.

34:07.512 --> 34:09.248
WAIT, VANESSA.

34:12.550 --> 34:15.586
-SORRY I--
-OKAY. BYE.

34:15.621 --> 34:17.755
GOOD LUCK WITH THIS ONE!

34:25.164 --> 34:26.364
OKAY.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.699
MM.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.302
I ALWAYS COME HERE
WHEN I'M HIGH.

34:30.335 --> 34:32.670
AND YOU ALWAYS
TAKE CARE OF ME.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.210
SENT.

34:38.242 --> 34:39.244
(giggling)

34:44.315 --> 34:45.818
I TOOK ECSTASY TONIGHT.

34:45.851 --> 34:48.420
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

34:48.454 --> 34:50.155
THAT'S PRETTY CRAZY.

34:50.188 --> 34:51.789
MM-HMM.

34:51.824 --> 34:53.759
I HAVE ANOTHER PILL
IF YOU WANT IT.

34:55.626 --> 34:56.695
I THINK I'M GOOD.

34:58.329 --> 35:01.432
YOU SURE?
BECAUSE IT FEELS AMAZING.

35:01.467 --> 35:04.436
I NEVER WANT TO
STOP FEELING AMAZING.

35:05.804 --> 35:08.239
DON'T YOU WANT TO FEEL AMAZING?

35:13.612 --> 35:14.847
HM?

35:17.682 --> 35:18.817
HM?

35:22.753 --> 35:23.889
HERE.

35:24.121 --> 35:25.657
HUG THIS.

35:28.659 --> 35:29.661
IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

35:29.695 --> 35:30.829
-TRUST ME...
-MM.

35:32.431 --> 35:33.664
I'VE BEEN THERE.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.235
I'LL GRAB YOU SOME WATER.

36:31.722 --> 36:32.791
(phone vibrating)

36:38.630 --> 36:39.831
(phone vibrating)

36:42.701 --> 36:44.670
APRIL, ARE YOU OKAY?

36:46.804 --> 36:47.905
(sobbing)

36:47.940 --> 36:49.807
NO, MOM.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.411
I'm not okay.

36:52.443 --> 36:54.478
(sobbing)

36:54.512 --> 36:57.748
I MISS HIM
SO MUCH IT HURTS.

36:59.483 --> 37:00.518
(sobbing)

37:00.552 --> 37:02.487
IT HURTS SO BADLY.

37:05.389 --> 37:07.592
WILL THIS PAIN EVER GO AWAY?

37:07.626 --> 37:09.961
Is it gonna be
like this forever?

37:09.994 --> 37:11.929
OH, HONEY.

37:11.963 --> 37:14.699
I'm trying not to think
about it all, but...

37:14.733 --> 37:16.568
no matter how hard

37:16.601 --> 37:19.704
I TRY TO DISTRACT MYSELF...

37:19.737 --> 37:23.307
NOTHING MAKES ME FEEL BETTER.

37:23.342 --> 37:25.543
You'll always miss Leo...

37:29.447 --> 37:32.483
but eventually,
it'll get easier...

37:32.516 --> 37:34.853
AND THE ACHING WILL HURT LESS.

37:34.885 --> 37:36.755
I PROMISE.

37:39.557 --> 37:42.527
It's gonna take time,

37:42.561 --> 37:44.730
but it's good that
you're talking about it.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.465
Keeping it inside...

37:47.498 --> 37:49.867
-IT ISN'T HEALTHY.
-Yeah.

37:49.900 --> 37:51.637
YOU'RE RIGHT.

37:51.670 --> 37:53.005
You want me to come
pick you up?

37:54.806 --> 37:56.708
NO, IT'S OKAY. I JUST...

37:57.943 --> 37:59.744
CAN YOU STAY ON THE PHONE
WITH ME, PLEASE?

37:59.777 --> 38:01.545
OF COURSE, HONEY.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.717
-(sighs)
-(sniffles)

38:26.704 --> 38:28.639
MORNING.

38:28.673 --> 38:31.076
HI. UM... ARE YOU PLAYING AGAIN?

38:31.309 --> 38:33.311
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
JUST MESSING AROUND.

38:33.344 --> 38:35.012
COOL. WELL, I WAS JUST...

38:35.047 --> 38:36.547
HEADING OUT.

38:36.581 --> 38:38.717
I WAS HOPING
I WOULDN'T CATCH YOU.

38:38.750 --> 38:41.353
SORRY FOR JUST...
SHOWING UP LAST NIGHT.

38:41.385 --> 38:44.389
-THERE WAS--
-HEY, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT. REALLY.

38:46.858 --> 38:49.994
-WHAT'S THAT?
-THAT IS THE OTHER ECSTASY PILL.

38:50.027 --> 38:52.530
I NEVER WANT
TO DO IT AGAIN. EVER.

38:52.563 --> 38:53.831
I LEARNED MY LESSON.

38:53.864 --> 38:55.666
THE HIGH WAS...

38:55.701 --> 38:56.867
REALLY HIGH.

38:56.902 --> 38:58.536
BUT THE LOW WAS...

38:58.570 --> 39:00.005
PRETTY TERRIBLE.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.909
I SHOULD DO DARE LECTURES, HUH?

39:06.677 --> 39:07.713
HEY...

39:11.349 --> 39:12.784
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
ME SAYING THIS,

39:12.818 --> 39:15.420
BUT THESE LAST FEW DAYS...

39:15.454 --> 39:16.588
HASN'T BEEN YOU.

39:18.056 --> 39:19.824
AND I GET THINGS
HAVEN'T BEEN EASY, BUT...

39:19.858 --> 39:22.393
YOU GOTTA GET
YOUR LIFE BACK, APRIL.

39:23.762 --> 39:24.963
WRITE YOUR BOOK.

39:26.030 --> 39:29.101
TAKE BACK THAT PASSION
YOU HAVE FOR IT.

39:29.134 --> 39:30.802
BE THE PERSON
I KNOW YOU ARE.

39:34.940 --> 39:38.076
Reporter:
WINTER STORM PAM SHOULD HIT
NEW YORK LATER TODAY,

39:38.110 --> 39:40.512
DUMPING AT LEAST A FOOT OF SNOW.

39:40.545 --> 39:42.713
-FROM THERE IT WILL HEAD
TOWARDS THE ATLANTIC,
-(footsteps)

39:42.748 --> 39:45.851
-WHERE IT WILL PETER OUT
JUST MISSING...
-MORNING, BRENNA.

39:45.884 --> 39:46.918
HI. CAN YOU SIGN THIS?

39:49.554 --> 39:52.724
"UC BERKELY SUMMER
FILMMAKING PROGRAM"?

39:52.757 --> 39:54.760
I'M GONNA APPLY
AND THEN MAYBE MOVE

39:54.793 --> 39:56.094
TO SAN FRANCISCO
AFTER HIGH SCHOOL.

39:56.128 --> 39:57.728
THE CITY SEEMS SO COOL

39:57.762 --> 39:59.463
AND THE FILM SCENE
IS REALLY GROWING.

39:59.498 --> 40:00.931
WH-- THAT'S SO FAR!

40:00.965 --> 40:02.800
BUT UNCLE GEORGE LIVES THERE.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.170
AND-- I... I GOTTA
GET TO SCHOOL

40:06.403 --> 40:08.405
BUT, UM, I'LL JUST--
I'LL GET THAT FROM YOU LATER.

40:08.440 --> 40:09.474
BYE, MOM.

40:10.842 --> 40:12.577
(door opens)

40:12.610 --> 40:13.878
(door closes)

40:13.911 --> 40:16.081
-(knocking)
-(door opening)

40:17.815 --> 40:18.849
IS BETH HOME?

40:18.884 --> 40:20.885
NICE TO SEE YOU TOO, APRIL.

40:20.918 --> 40:23.621
-SHE'S AT WORK ALREADY.
-IT'S ALL RIGHT.

40:23.655 --> 40:25.990
UM, I JUST CAME OVER
TO APOLOGIZE.

40:26.023 --> 40:27.893
WE GOT INTO
A BIG FIGHT LAST NIGHT

40:27.925 --> 40:29.126
AND I FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT IT...

40:29.161 --> 40:30.795
AS WELL AS ABOUT EVERYTHING

40:30.829 --> 40:32.063
I'VE BEEN DOING
IN THE PAST FEW DAYS.

40:32.097 --> 40:33.130
YEAH.

40:33.164 --> 40:35.666
I HAD TO LIE
TO CHRIS AT THE CHARLES

40:35.699 --> 40:37.768
AND SAY I'D NEVER MET
YOU BEFORE THAT NIGHT.

40:37.802 --> 40:39.137
I'M SORRY.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.505
BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE
I WANTED TO KEEP MY JOB.

40:41.539 --> 40:43.574
PERSONALLY...

40:43.608 --> 40:44.976
I THINK YOU GET A FREE PASS

40:45.010 --> 40:46.945
AFTER EVERYTHING
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.

40:46.978 --> 40:49.079
THANK YOU, BUT...

40:52.184 --> 40:53.885
I DON'T REALLY LIKE
ME RIGHT NOW.

40:53.918 --> 40:56.954
YOU KNOW,
WHO HAVE I BECOME?

40:56.987 --> 40:59.724
BLOWING ALL THIS MONEY
AND TAKING DRUGS?

40:59.757 --> 41:01.827
I MEAN, IT'S ALL
SO REPREHENSIBLE.

41:02.893 --> 41:04.695
KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE
WHAT OUR DAD WAS DOING

41:04.728 --> 41:06.130
THE YEAR BEFORE HE DIED.

41:06.164 --> 41:08.800
HM. IT DOES.

41:08.833 --> 41:10.902
AND THE WHOLE TIME,
I WAS MAD AT HIM

41:10.936 --> 41:13.237
FOR HIS CRAZY BEHAVIOR
AND... HERE I AM,

41:13.471 --> 41:16.007
DOING THE EXACT SAME THING.

41:17.108 --> 41:18.976
I GUESS I REALLY
AM MY FATHER'S DAUGHTER.

41:19.010 --> 41:21.980
APRIL, YOU ARE
NOTHING LIKE OUR DAD.

41:22.012 --> 41:24.014
MAYBE I AM.

41:24.048 --> 41:26.784
MAYBE GOOD PEOPLE
CAN DO BAD THINGS

41:26.818 --> 41:28.485
IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS.

41:28.519 --> 41:30.588
YOU KNOW,
WITH THE WAY I'M ACTING
BECAUSE LEO DIED AND...

41:30.621 --> 41:33.090
THE WAY DAD WAS ACTING
BECAUSE YOUR MOM WAS PRESSURING

41:33.123 --> 41:34.159
HIM TO BE WITH HER, SO...

41:34.192 --> 41:36.695
MY MOM NEVER WANTED
TO BE WITH DAD.

41:36.728 --> 41:39.197
SHE'S BEEN HAPPILY DATING
THIS CUBAN ARCHITECT

41:39.231 --> 41:41.532
NAMED MARCO FOR LIKE, EVER.

41:41.565 --> 41:42.967
LONG BEFORE DAD DIED.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.034
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

41:45.170 --> 41:46.271
GEORGE.

41:59.583 --> 42:00.684
HEY.

42:00.719 --> 42:01.920
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HOME.

42:03.922 --> 42:04.989
WE NEED TO TALK.

42:11.528 --> 42:13.664
