WEBVTT

00:10.040 --> 00:11.900
One 3âD knitter.
Check.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.300
Five boxes
of freezeâdried taquitos.
Check.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.300
Oh, sweet!
They've got carne asada!

00:16.400 --> 00:17.820
You want one?
No, dude.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.920
If Benson catches us
taking a snack break

00:19.760 --> 00:21.840
instead of doing inventory,
he's gonna flip his lid.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.020
Now, come on.
What's next?

00:23.120 --> 00:25.940
Fine.
One, uh, uh...

00:26.040 --> 00:27.740
What the heck
is this thing?

00:27.840 --> 00:31.500
I don't know.
Hmm. HmâHmâHm!

00:31.600 --> 00:33.220
Rigby! Are you okay?!

00:33.320 --> 00:35.540
Rigby?
Oh, no. Oh, no.

00:35.640 --> 00:37.220
Oh, Rigby!

00:37.320 --> 00:38.340
Dude!
( Screams )

00:38.440 --> 00:39.940
Don't do that!

00:40.040 --> 00:41.860
Wait, how'd you get
all the way over there?

00:41.960 --> 00:43.260
I don't know.

00:43.360 --> 00:45.360
I was over here, and there was
this flash of light,

00:44.640 --> 00:46.640
and then
I was over there...

00:45.800 --> 00:47.100
in that other pod.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.940
Dude, do you realize
what this is?!

00:50.040 --> 00:52.620
Teleporter!

00:52.720 --> 00:55.300
( Cheering )

00:55.400 --> 00:57.220
Hwah!

00:57.320 --> 00:58.860
Aagh!
Yeah!

00:58.960 --> 01:01.020
( Laughing )

01:01.120 --> 01:02.140
Hwah!

01:02.240 --> 01:04.240
( Laughing )
( Grunts )

01:10.760 --> 01:13.540
( Laughing )

01:13.640 --> 01:16.420
Okay. Okay.
Oh, watch this!
No, it's my turn!

01:16.520 --> 01:18.520
Dude,
this'll just take a sec!

01:17.800 --> 01:19.300
No!
Aagh, Rigby!

01:19.400 --> 01:21.340
Will you chill, man?!
Geez!

01:21.440 --> 01:24.160
No! I want to go!

01:26.400 --> 01:28.400
Dude, I don't think we're
supposed to go through together.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.300
What
are you talking about?
I don't know.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.760
What if we got messed up
or something?
Whatever, man,
we're fine.

01:32.840 --> 01:34.980
Still, I just don't think
it's a good ââ aagh!

01:35.080 --> 01:37.340
What?
Dude, your butt!

01:37.440 --> 01:39.460
Aw, what?!
I got your butt!

01:39.560 --> 01:41.780
Oh, great!
Now I'm the oneâcheek wonder.

01:41.880 --> 01:43.340
I don't want
your messed up butt.

01:43.440 --> 01:45.180
Don't make fun
of my butt.
Yeah, whatever.

01:45.280 --> 01:47.180
What are we gonna do
about this?!
I don't know.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.440
Maybe if we go through again,
we'll change back?
Good idea.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.860
Man, how do you walk around
with this thing?

01:51.960 --> 01:53.900
It's all lopsided.
You're lopsided!

01:54.000 --> 01:56.140
What is going on in here!?
Look at this mess!

01:56.240 --> 01:58.700
I knew I couldn't trust you guys
with inventory.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.800
No, Benson,
we're almost done!

02:00.040 --> 02:03.180
No. You <i>aredone.</i>
And what is this?

02:03.280 --> 02:05.280
What is what? I don't know
what you're talking about.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.920
Yeah, Benson,
it's a free country.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.260
Whatever.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.940
Just go outside
and rake the leaves.

02:09.040 --> 02:11.220
Aw, come on!
Just give us five minutes!

02:11.320 --> 02:14.280
No, now! Move it!

02:19.880 --> 02:21.340
( Sighs )

02:21.440 --> 02:23.780
Of all the idiotic things
I gotta deal with today.

02:23.880 --> 02:25.420
Aw, man!
He locked the door.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.460
Dude, we gotta get Benson's keys
so we can get back in there.

02:28.560 --> 02:31.140
Man: <i>We all know ghosts</i>
<i>are totally real...</i>

02:31.240 --> 02:34.540
<i>Oooh!</i>
<i>Agh! Carlos, get help!</i>

02:34.640 --> 02:37.380
<i>...and they're coming for you</i>
<i>on Earth!</i>

02:37.480 --> 02:40.220
<i>But what about in space?!</i>

02:40.320 --> 02:42.540
<i>We'll find out ââ</i>
<i>on tonight's episode</i>

02:42.640 --> 02:45.660
<i>of "Ghosts Are Totally Real</i>
<i>and They're Coming for You!"</i>

02:45.760 --> 02:47.740
( Scoffs )
Bunch of bologna.

02:47.840 --> 02:51.060
Oh! Not you, Sammy!

02:51.160 --> 02:53.940
You're beautiful.

02:54.040 --> 02:57.080
( Volume increases )

03:00.440 --> 03:02.060
Hey, what do you think
he's watching?

03:02.160 --> 03:04.620
Dude, we're doing a thing
right now!

03:04.720 --> 03:07.140
Get your head in the game.
Sheesh. Sorry.

03:07.240 --> 03:08.900
Those ghosts just look
totally real

03:09.000 --> 03:10.820
and, like,
they're coming for that guy!

03:10.920 --> 03:13.820
It looks good!
We should ask him to tape it.

03:13.920 --> 03:16.060
Dude. ( Groans )

03:16.160 --> 03:18.160
You see the keys
to the Domeâitory anywhere?

03:17.800 --> 03:20.540
Hmm.
Oh, yeah, there they are!

03:20.640 --> 03:22.640
They're sitting
right next to him!

03:22.080 --> 03:24.080
Aw!
You gotta be kidding me!

03:23.240 --> 03:24.740
We're never
getting those keys.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.840
Benson probably
sleeps with those things!

03:25.880 --> 03:27.220
Ow!

03:27.320 --> 03:28.900
( Sighs )
It's hopeless.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
I guess we should start getting
used to these new butts.

03:30.760 --> 03:31.860
Welp, I gotta use it.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.620
Ew! No, dude!

03:33.720 --> 03:37.140
We're getting those keys,
and I'm getting my butt back!

03:37.240 --> 03:40.980
Hola, bros. What's goingââ
( Shrieks )

03:41.080 --> 03:43.180
Why are yourââ
( Muffled shouting )

03:43.280 --> 03:44.780
Shh!

03:44.880 --> 03:46.340
Hmm.

03:46.440 --> 03:47.740
I think he's gone.

03:47.840 --> 03:50.020
Bros, what happened
to your butts?!

03:50.120 --> 03:52.120
We were taking inventory
in the Domeâitory,

03:51.840 --> 03:53.840
and we found these teleporters,
but we accidentally ââ

03:53.800 --> 03:55.420
Oh! Say no more!

03:55.520 --> 03:57.940
I'm a licensed teleportation
technician!

03:58.040 --> 03:59.260
What?!
No, you're not!

03:59.360 --> 04:00.540
Yeah, bro!

04:00.640 --> 04:02.340
It was part of
my Space Tree training!

04:02.440 --> 04:04.060
You have to
calibrate the machine

04:04.160 --> 04:06.600
when you're teleporting more
than one sentient life form!

04:06.680 --> 04:08.220
Uh, no doy!

04:08.320 --> 04:10.320
Well, it doesn't matter
if we can't get those keys!

04:10.200 --> 04:12.200
Well, you guys
better hurry.

04:11.480 --> 04:13.620
The genetic mutation
is only gonna continue

04:13.720 --> 04:15.720
until you completely transform
into each other.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.800
That's not gonna happen to us,
is it?

04:17.200 --> 04:18.660
No, dude.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.760
That's the kind of stuff
that happens in dumb movies!

04:20.400 --> 04:21.540
This is real life!

04:21.640 --> 04:24.580
Those kind of things
don't happen in real life!

04:24.680 --> 04:26.660
What?!

04:26.760 --> 04:28.180
( Screams )
( Screams )

04:28.280 --> 04:31.040
( Screams )
( All screaming )

04:33.000 --> 04:34.260
We gotta get those keys.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.820
Man:
<i>They feed off the fear</i>

04:35.920 --> 04:37.920
<i>of the unfortunate</i>
<i>spaceâfairing souls</i>

04:37.880 --> 04:40.580
<i>who cross their paths.</i>

04:40.680 --> 04:41.980
That's ââ what the?!
Hey!

04:42.080 --> 04:43.660
( Screams )
( Loud crash )

04:43.760 --> 04:46.180
Aw, come on ââ seriously?!

04:46.280 --> 04:48.340
Hello?
Is someone there?

04:48.440 --> 04:49.540
Oof!
( Grunting )

04:49.640 --> 04:51.540
Hey!

04:51.640 --> 04:54.340
Spaceâghosts aren't real.
Spaceâghosts aren't real.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.440
I got the keys.
Let's roll!

04:59.240 --> 05:01.260
Okay, let's get this
over with already!

05:01.360 --> 05:03.360
Muscle Man
better be right about this.

05:05.160 --> 05:07.160
( Screaming )

05:10.520 --> 05:13.300
Hey, I think it worked!
Uh...

05:13.400 --> 05:16.940
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Dude! Now it's even worse!

05:17.040 --> 05:19.100
I don't know, man.
I'm kind of into it.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.700
I'm finally as tall
as my brother.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.180
Eat it, Don,
where ever you are!

05:22.280 --> 05:25.620
No, what?! This is terrible!
Look at me, dude!

05:25.720 --> 05:27.500
I'm a short, tiny freak!

05:27.600 --> 05:29.100
Oh, so <i>that's</i>
what you think of me?!

05:29.200 --> 05:30.940
Aw, come on!
That's not what I meant!

05:31.040 --> 05:32.500
Oh, I knew what you meant!

05:32.600 --> 05:34.600
You don't like being
in my shoes!

05:33.840 --> 05:36.780
I just want to be me again!
It's not fair!

05:36.880 --> 05:38.540
( Sighs )
You're right, it's not fair.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.620
We should play punchies
for it.

05:40.720 --> 05:41.540
Huh?

05:41.640 --> 05:42.900
( Groans )

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
I guess we'll stay like this,
then.

05:44.160 --> 05:47.940
( Groans )
Rigby, no!

05:48.040 --> 05:49.940
Come back, Rigby!

05:50.040 --> 05:52.920
( Laughing )

05:58.240 --> 05:59.820
Yeah!

05:59.920 --> 06:01.260
( Growls )

06:01.360 --> 06:04.220
( Grunts )
Stupid stubby legs!

06:04.320 --> 06:06.540
Hey, Fives, should I throw
these astronaut diapers

06:06.640 --> 06:08.060
in with the raw sewage?

06:08.160 --> 06:11.060
Yeah!
Anything that has moisture.
( Grunts )

06:11.160 --> 06:13.820
Hi Five:
And now, through the magic
of reverse osmosis,

06:13.920 --> 06:16.540
you'd never know
this used to be waste water!

06:16.640 --> 06:19.260
( Gulping )
( Laughing )

06:19.360 --> 06:20.380
Did you see that?!

06:20.480 --> 06:22.220
Was there something
in the water?

06:22.320 --> 06:24.320
I might need to replace
the filter.

06:23.640 --> 06:25.700
( Growling )

06:25.800 --> 06:27.220
( Laughing )

06:27.320 --> 06:29.340
( Growls )

06:29.440 --> 06:31.420
Oof! Huh?

06:31.520 --> 06:35.140
Where did I put my keys?!
( Sighs )

06:35.240 --> 06:37.500
Let's see,
I was watching TV...

06:37.600 --> 06:38.940
Did they fall
into the couch?

06:39.040 --> 06:41.940
Okay, fun's over, Rigby.
Let's go back to the teleporter.

06:42.040 --> 06:44.580
No way, man!
This is great!
Come on, dude.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.600
I don't want to be stuck
in your weak little body!

06:46.680 --> 06:49.220
Me, neither!
( Grunting )

06:49.320 --> 06:52.100
Go back!
Never!

06:52.200 --> 06:53.980
Muscle Man:
Unbelievable! Ugh!

06:54.080 --> 06:56.020
I can't even count
how many protocols

06:56.120 --> 06:59.220
in the teleporter code of ethics
you two are breaking right now.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.460
We need to get you guys
switched back, stat!

07:01.560 --> 07:03.780
Dude, I know.
Try telling Rigby that.

07:03.880 --> 07:05.780
No way, man!
This is the new me.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.660
I'm never losing at punchies
again.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.100
No, bro,
this is not natural.

07:10.200 --> 07:13.220
You see, when I became a
licensed teleporter technician,

07:13.320 --> 07:14.900
I took a sacred oath.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.140
And right now,
you're making a mockery

07:17.240 --> 07:18.780
of everything I stand for!

07:18.880 --> 07:20.260
( Growls )

07:20.360 --> 07:22.700
( Grunting )

07:22.800 --> 07:24.820
Mordecai, get his legs!

07:24.920 --> 07:26.740
No, no!

07:26.840 --> 07:28.580
( Groaning )
Let me go!

07:28.680 --> 07:30.620
Shut it, Rigby!
Muscle Man, how's it going?

07:30.720 --> 07:31.820
Almost got it.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.420
Okay, baby, talk to me.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.020
Let's make this right.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.340
( Grunting )
Dude,
will you knock it off!?

07:37.440 --> 07:39.060
( Gasps )
Muscle Man!

07:39.160 --> 07:40.140
Rigby, chill!

07:40.240 --> 07:41.420
( Grunting )

07:41.520 --> 07:43.340
Shove him
into the teleporter!

07:43.440 --> 07:45.660
Step back!

07:45.760 --> 07:47.880
( Slowed )
Huh? No, bro!

07:53.560 --> 07:56.380
( Coughing )

07:56.480 --> 07:59.220
Aw, yeah!
Whooâhoo! It worked!

07:59.320 --> 08:01.100
Hey, Rigby, stop pouting
and get out here!

08:01.200 --> 08:04.080
( Groaning loudly )

08:06.440 --> 08:07.980
What the...?!

08:08.080 --> 08:11.080
( Dramatic music plays )

08:14.640 --> 08:15.580
( Roars )

08:15.680 --> 08:17.220
( Screams )
Oh, no, bro!

08:17.320 --> 08:20.100
( Grunts )

08:20.200 --> 08:21.700
Play punchies?

08:21.800 --> 08:23.620
Dude, no!
Eh?

08:23.720 --> 08:26.600
( Laughing )

08:31.760 --> 08:33.540
Ooh!

08:33.640 --> 08:34.940
Muscle Man:
( Groans )

08:35.040 --> 08:36.900
Muscle Man,
are you okay?!
Yeah.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.900
Dude, what the heck happened
to Rigby?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.740
I didn't calibrate the machine
for three people, bro.

08:41.840 --> 08:44.260
Him pulling me in there
threw everything off.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.560
We gotta catch him and switch
him back before he gets worse.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.180
But we're gonna need
some bait.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.580
Mmâhmm.

08:49.680 --> 08:52.000
I think I've got an idea.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.620
It's better this way!
We're strong now!

09:00.720 --> 09:03.700
No, what?! No!
We're perfect!

09:03.800 --> 09:05.800
Shh!

09:06.880 --> 09:08.340
( Grunts )

09:08.440 --> 09:10.440
( Roars )

09:16.800 --> 09:19.220
Huh?
( Growls )

09:19.320 --> 09:21.320
Get back here!

09:22.560 --> 09:24.100
( Panting )

09:24.200 --> 09:27.760
( Grunting )

09:33.240 --> 09:35.620
Hey, Eileen, what do you think
of my new ripped bod?

09:35.720 --> 09:36.900
( Screams )

09:37.000 --> 09:38.100
Yeah, she loves it.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.060
( Grunts )

09:39.160 --> 09:40.380
( Roars )

09:45.760 --> 09:47.780
Huh?

09:47.880 --> 09:48.940
Huh?

09:49.040 --> 09:51.040
( Laughs )

09:52.760 --> 09:54.340
( Grunts )

09:54.440 --> 09:56.020
( Glass shatters )

09:56.120 --> 09:58.400
Whoa!

10:01.520 --> 10:04.060
( Grunts )

10:04.160 --> 10:06.900
I got you, bro!
What the heck, Rigby?!

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
You know how long it took us
to make that trap?

10:08.960 --> 10:10.500
Not cool, dude.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.600
I might've gotten
a little carried away.
Ya think?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.860
Come help us
put these teleporters back

10:13.960 --> 10:15.620
before Benson notices
they're gone.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.960
( Sighs )
Yeah, I'll be right there.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.300
( Exhales )

10:22.400 --> 10:24.860
I can do this!

10:24.960 --> 10:26.300
( Growls )

10:26.400 --> 10:29.300
( Grunting )

10:29.400 --> 10:30.980
Oof!

10:31.080 --> 10:33.700
( Groans )

10:47.640 --> 10:50.440
( Laughing )
