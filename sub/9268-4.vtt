00:36.773 --> 00:38.053
Hello?

00:39.933 --> 00:41.333
Hello?

01:40.093 --> 01:43.092
It'll be nice having
a German visiting.

01:43.093 --> 01:45.252
Very nice indeed.

01:45.253 --> 01:48.813
I'm sure he'll know where he is
without the flag. Oh!

01:52.229 --> 01:53.709
Sid?!

01:58.549 --> 01:59.829
Father, I think that's him.

02:03.229 --> 02:06.628
Father Franc, I presume?
Father Brown.

02:06.629 --> 02:10.467
Mrs McCarthy, parish secretary.
Welcome.

02:10.469 --> 02:11.628
Good morning.

02:11.629 --> 02:13.307
Bishop Talbot sends his apologies.

02:13.308 --> 02:14.907
He did so want to meet you himself

02:14.908 --> 02:17.669
but, unfortunately,
a diocesan matter came up.

02:17.670 --> 02:20.349
NOT that he resents Germans.

02:22.349 --> 02:24.868
So, ich bin dein host!

02:24.869 --> 02:26.668
Ah...

02:26.669 --> 02:29.789
danke shoen.
Father, English, please.

02:32.149 --> 02:33.429
Shall we?

02:42.749 --> 02:46.148
Who'd have thought it,
the train was on time!

02:46.149 --> 02:48.749
Ja, I heard it's quite
a rarity in England.

02:48.750 --> 02:52.228
Our trains run like clockwork,
actually, Father.

02:52.229 --> 02:53.508
Ja, of course,

02:53.509 --> 02:56.229
and we have Britain to thank
for the Industrial Revolution.

02:56.230 --> 02:57.348
Yes.

02:57.349 --> 03:01.428
Such a pity so many of
our great factories were destroyed.

03:01.429 --> 03:05.149
I think I should warn you that
the war is still a painful memory

03:05.150 --> 03:07.188
for some of our parishioners.

03:07.189 --> 03:10.468
No-one blames you personally,
of course.

03:10.469 --> 03:14.349
We are very excited about
your Mass for Peace on Tuesday...

03:14.350 --> 03:15.429
are you?

03:17.109 --> 03:19.788
Are you excited, Father Franc?

03:19.789 --> 03:20.829
My Gott!

03:23.149 --> 03:24.629
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

03:32.269 --> 03:35.428
I just heard this... moaning...

03:35.429 --> 03:36.509
and there he was.

03:38.029 --> 03:40.587
Father Brown,
thank heavens you're here.

03:40.588 --> 03:41.749
This is a crime scene.

03:42.789 --> 03:44.869
It's all right, they're with me.

03:47.269 --> 03:50.109
He's still alive.
Your presence is not required.

03:52.589 --> 03:54.029
Although I suspect...

03:55.989 --> 03:57.988
if you check...

03:57.989 --> 04:00.549
you'll find a carriage
with a shattered window.

04:00.550 --> 04:04.108
The proximity to the viaduct
hadn't escaped me.

04:04.109 --> 04:08.269
Stripped? On a train?!
What WAS he up to?

04:11.429 --> 04:14.028
Any clues as to who he is? No.

04:14.029 --> 04:15.987
Now, I really must ask you to leave

04:15.988 --> 04:18.309
and please take your colleague
with you.

04:24.149 --> 04:25.709
Perhaps a nice cup of tea?

04:25.710 --> 04:30.268
Father... what if he dies
without being identified?

04:30.269 --> 04:33.027
I'm sure the Inspector
will do all he can.

04:33.028 --> 04:36.709
But what if he has a family
out there, worried sick about him?

04:36.710 --> 04:38.309
We'll be late for mass.

04:44.909 --> 04:48.187
Father Franc has travelled all
the way from Germany to visit us.

04:48.188 --> 04:50.987
Is that what they call
an invasion these days?

04:50.988 --> 04:53.627
His parishioners in Berlin bear
many of the scars

04:53.628 --> 04:55.347
that have marked our families.

04:55.348 --> 04:58.829
I trust you will all attend
his Mass for Peace on Tuesday.

05:00.549 --> 05:07.069
And let's not forget Father Franc's
welcome soiree this evening. Mm!

05:08.789 --> 05:11.828
A seasonal buffet will be provided.

05:11.829 --> 05:14.469
Ah, Annie, welcome back.

05:15.469 --> 05:17.469
I'm so glad you could join us today.

05:17.470 --> 05:20.989
Don't be... I only come
to get up people's noses.

05:23.389 --> 05:30.108
A month in prison has once again
failed to reform that woman. Yes.

05:30.109 --> 05:33.707
Well, Annie's life has not
been blessed with opportunity.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.949
Well, that's hardly an excuse for...

05:38.269 --> 05:40.788
Yes, Mrs McCarthy?

05:40.789 --> 05:42.388
Bad manners.

05:42.389 --> 05:43.589
No, of course not...

05:44.749 --> 05:47.069
but it does explain
her prostitution.

05:52.149 --> 05:53.908
God bless, Father.

05:53.909 --> 05:56.869
I noticed you were on the train
this morning. Yes?

05:56.870 --> 06:00.828
Did you spot anything suspicious
in your journey? No.

06:00.829 --> 06:04.269
I slept the whole way.
If you'll excuse me, Father.

06:04.270 --> 06:06.388
Annie!

06:06.389 --> 06:07.509
Oh.

06:08.749 --> 06:10.867
Prison food make you thin again.

06:10.868 --> 06:13.427
I finish cleaning
and I cook for you.

06:13.428 --> 06:15.109
Never offered to cook for me!

06:15.110 --> 06:18.108
Cos you eat with your mouth open.

06:18.109 --> 06:22.788
Have you seen who's staying
at the presbytery? Lucky girl.

06:22.789 --> 06:24.467
Susie, no, you don't want to...

06:24.468 --> 06:28.707
Are you Father Brown's guest?
Hello. I'm Susie, his housekeeper.

06:28.708 --> 06:32.029
Guten morgen, erm... Morning.
Pleased to meet you.

06:35.309 --> 06:37.428
Susie, I said...

06:37.429 --> 06:40.948
So... now I scrub floor for Germans?

06:40.949 --> 06:44.428
Poland help you to win war and...

06:44.429 --> 06:47.189
right now I see Poland
means nothing to you people.

06:47.190 --> 06:50.628
Well, I didn't...
Hang on a second, Susie! Sid!

06:50.629 --> 06:52.949
Oh, brilliant! May have a word?

06:54.229 --> 06:56.028
Do you know this man?

06:56.029 --> 06:58.149
If you paid your artist, I might do.

06:59.869 --> 07:01.788
Hm.

07:01.789 --> 07:04.627
I hear you were on the train.
Did you see anything suspicious?

07:04.628 --> 07:06.667
I did see Annie Mace
coming out of first class.

07:06.668 --> 07:08.667
I suspect she didn't have a ticket.

07:08.668 --> 07:11.787
Hm! A man was pushed
from the first class carriage.

07:11.788 --> 07:14.829
Where did Annie get to?
Um, she was here a moment ago.

07:15.829 --> 07:17.947
Right, I'll need
a witness statement.

07:17.948 --> 07:21.067
Any chance we could just forget
what I just said?

07:21.068 --> 07:24.027
Annie has problems with the police.
Perhaps I should speak to her?

07:24.028 --> 07:26.909
Best to keep out of
the investigation, eh, Father?

07:34.069 --> 07:35.709
Mrs McCarthy? Oh.

07:37.029 --> 07:38.908
The Good Samaritan.

07:38.909 --> 07:40.669
There's a parable I hold dear.

07:46.109 --> 07:49.309
All alone, Father. Who is he?

07:52.109 --> 07:55.108
The body carries a thousand clues.

07:55.109 --> 07:57.428
The red mark on your nose

07:57.429 --> 08:00.868
tells me you were reading
into the early hours.

08:00.869 --> 08:02.468
Well, it's true.

08:02.469 --> 08:05.389
The Gospel of Luke
never fails to enthral.

08:06.949 --> 08:10.708
I expect Bill has a wife somewhere,
worried to death.

08:10.709 --> 08:12.788
Bill?

08:12.789 --> 08:14.309
I had to give him a name.

08:15.749 --> 08:21.188
Now, I promised Mrs Murphy
a light tea before this soiree.

08:21.189 --> 08:24.229
Her majesty's buffet fare
agrees with neither of us.

08:25.749 --> 08:26.869
Father?

08:27.909 --> 08:29.589
I need to speak to Annie Mace.

08:33.909 --> 08:35.669
Oh, what about this one?

08:36.708 --> 08:39.029
Lubie twoj usmiech.

08:40.549 --> 08:43.509
What?! What are you laughing at?
I just said, "I like your smile."

08:43.510 --> 08:46.148
In which language? Ooh-hoo!

08:46.149 --> 08:49.909
I'm going to make you your own little
bit of Poland, just like home.

08:58.509 --> 09:01.308
Listen, why don't you go see Annie?
Eh?

09:01.309 --> 09:04.309
Her lady prison yarns
are always a good laugh.

09:04.310 --> 09:06.188
No, I do my job properly.

09:06.189 --> 09:08.349
Since when? Sid, please.

09:15.469 --> 09:17.549
I'd stay out of her way,
if I was you.

09:24.269 --> 09:26.788
So where in Poland are you from?

09:26.789 --> 09:28.869
I'm just here to clean. All right?

09:35.429 --> 09:37.707
I was hoping it might take
more than a few hours

09:37.708 --> 09:38.947
before I saw you, Annie.

09:38.948 --> 09:40.669
No, you weren't. You love it.

09:42.709 --> 09:45.987
A witness saw you leave the
first class carriage in distress.

09:45.988 --> 09:48.387
I didn't budge from
the delights of third class.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.347
A man was pushed from
the first class carriage

09:50.348 --> 09:52.987
shortly before the train
reached Kembleford.

09:52.988 --> 09:55.427
Let's cut to the chase, Inspector...

09:55.428 --> 09:58.187
we both know you've only brought
me here for one thing.

09:58.188 --> 10:02.587
You do realise you're a suspect in
an attempted murder investigation?

10:02.588 --> 10:06.149
Ten years ago, you... THAT was
self defence and you know it.

10:07.189 --> 10:09.069
I won't be made the scapegoat
for this.

10:09.070 --> 10:12.228
Your weekly visitor, sir. Oh!

10:12.229 --> 10:13.389
He says it's urgent.

10:23.429 --> 10:25.868
We gave Micky Spratt a ticking off.

10:25.869 --> 10:28.829
His mum says he won't be drawing
rude things on your cart again.

10:28.830 --> 10:30.389
I was on that train.

10:31.789 --> 10:35.949
Is there something you'd like
to tell me, Christy? Not especially.

10:35.950 --> 10:37.908
I was in third class.

10:37.909 --> 10:40.188
I didn't see anything suspicious.

10:40.189 --> 10:42.229
Right... thank you.

10:46.269 --> 10:49.029
Christy, did you happen
to see Annie Mace at all?

10:50.629 --> 10:54.028
I was worried because
she was sitting close by.

10:54.029 --> 10:57.388
You hear stories about
her pinching stuff.

10:57.389 --> 10:59.789
Did she leave the carriage
or seem distressed?

10:59.790 --> 11:03.108
No. She didn't leave her seat once.

11:03.109 --> 11:06.349
We've a witness who's certain
she did. I'm very sure she didn't.

11:07.349 --> 11:09.389
So my witness is lying then?

11:13.669 --> 11:16.948
I feel certain Bill
is a good Christian man.

11:16.949 --> 11:19.267
The look of peace
that came over his face

11:19.268 --> 11:21.347
when I read to him from Corinthians.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.907
Are you quite sure?
He was found almost naked.

11:23.908 --> 11:25.507
Have you seen Annie at all?

11:25.508 --> 11:28.467
Not yet. Oh, she'll be here.
Hello, how are you?

11:28.468 --> 11:31.749
One whiff of free food
and she's like a rat up a drainpipe.

11:31.750 --> 11:34.468
Oh, talk of the devil.

11:34.469 --> 11:37.668
Unlike Miss Mace
to be free of an evening!

11:37.669 --> 11:41.669
So nice of Lady Felicia to wheel out
the old folk before they die.

11:41.670 --> 11:42.788
Oh!

11:42.789 --> 11:46.589
If Mrs McCarthy had soiree the only
guests would be her and a cat!

11:46.590 --> 11:50.029
How lovely you both look. Liar.

11:51.189 --> 11:53.869
Annie, Sid tells me you may
have witnessed something

11:53.870 --> 11:57.028
in the first class carriage. No.

11:57.029 --> 12:01.828
The man in tree?
Are you a witness? Course not!

12:01.829 --> 12:06.348
Maybe you could speak to her?
Why is everyone pointing finger?

12:06.349 --> 12:10.109
She was so nice to me when I come
here. She would not push man.

12:23.829 --> 12:25.229
Remember your promise.

12:29.189 --> 12:36.229
Ladies and gentlemen, our most
welcome German guest, Father Franc!

12:41.749 --> 12:43.588
Er, hello...

12:43.589 --> 12:47.828
thank you for this wonderful, um...
soiree, Lady Felicia.

12:47.829 --> 12:49.588
Hear, hear!

12:49.589 --> 12:53.669
And thank you all for welcoming me
to your beautiful country.

12:53.670 --> 12:55.629
Has he seen Coventry? Hm?

12:56.749 --> 12:59.469
Well, thank you for coming and...

13:05.389 --> 13:07.429
Form an orderly queue, ladies!

13:07.430 --> 13:08.829
Eh?

13:14.629 --> 13:18.069
Annie seems to think she DIDN'T
witness anything on the train.

13:18.070 --> 13:22.028
You are having a laugh?
Father, there is a free buffet.

13:22.029 --> 13:23.869
Let your hair down for once.

13:27.309 --> 13:28.748
So...

13:28.749 --> 13:32.069
better get in early if you want
to ride on my "motor-sicle".

13:33.309 --> 13:36.828
It's not motorcycle,
it's "motor-sicle"!

13:36.829 --> 13:38.348
Looks expensive.

13:38.349 --> 13:41.229
Well, that's the fruits
of hard graft, darling. Good evening.

13:43.829 --> 13:46.227
I apologise. I approached uninvited.

13:46.228 --> 13:47.829
Didn't stop you in Poland, did it?

13:47.830 --> 13:50.468
Oh, what have you done?

13:50.469 --> 13:52.668
Ow! Here you are, let me. No!

13:52.669 --> 13:54.107
It needs to be cleaned.

13:54.108 --> 13:57.069
It's, it's fine.
It's OK, come on. It's fine.

14:03.109 --> 14:05.029
A respectable
member of the community

14:05.030 --> 14:08.148
has contradicted
your witness statement.

14:08.149 --> 14:11.828
Apparently Annie Mace
didn't move from third class.

14:11.829 --> 14:14.547
And I hear that contraption
outside's yours? Mm-hm.

14:14.548 --> 14:17.547
How did you afford it?
My granny gave me 50 quid.

14:17.548 --> 14:20.067
Your grandmother in Southampton?
Who you've just visited?

14:20.068 --> 14:22.547
Yeah, my dear old granny
in Southampton.

14:22.548 --> 14:25.069
Well, you see we think the man,
given his stripped state,

14:25.070 --> 14:27.428
was a victim of theft.

14:27.429 --> 14:30.188
Anything you want to tell me? No.

14:30.189 --> 14:31.469
You sure? Yep!

14:33.509 --> 14:36.549
Fine. That'll be all... for now.

14:41.309 --> 14:44.469
You're not suggesting Sid
had anything to do with this?

14:46.109 --> 14:49.347
Was it Christy who contradicted
Sid's statement, by any chance?

14:49.348 --> 14:51.467
You've a personal interest, Father.

14:51.468 --> 14:53.747
So best keep your distance
this time.

14:53.748 --> 14:57.189
Unless you want to find yourself
on the wrong side of the law?

14:59.669 --> 15:01.669
Ah, keep it up, keep it up! Up!

15:04.389 --> 15:05.429
OK...

15:06.669 --> 15:08.229
I don't need your help.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.188
There.

15:15.189 --> 15:17.389
I don't need your help!

15:21.109 --> 15:22.629
My apologies for helping.

15:30.669 --> 15:34.028
Have you given Christy
cause for a vendetta?

15:34.029 --> 15:36.508
Sid, have you cheated him?

15:36.509 --> 15:38.348
No more than usual.

15:38.349 --> 15:40.989
Are you telling me everything?
What about the money for this?

15:40.990 --> 15:43.668
Oh, shall I wheel Granny down here?

15:43.669 --> 15:46.669
Yeah, that's right, I'll get her to
do a broadcast on Mrs M's bullhorn.

15:46.670 --> 15:48.188
She gave me 50 quid.

15:48.189 --> 15:50.387
Well, I'm sure a telephone call
to your grandmother

15:50.388 --> 15:52.307
would quell Valentine's suspicions.

15:52.308 --> 15:55.547
No, Granny don't have a telephone.
They're the devil's work, apparently.

15:55.548 --> 15:57.307
A visit from our local
police officer

15:57.308 --> 15:58.947
is no doubt being arranged then.

15:58.948 --> 16:01.309
Fret not, Father.
It's all in hand.

16:01.310 --> 16:04.708
The inspector knows
you're up to something.

16:04.709 --> 16:07.507
If you don't tell me
what it is, I can't help you!

16:07.508 --> 16:10.749
I'm beginning to think
that you don't trust me, Father.

16:25.909 --> 16:27.869
Rag and bone!

16:29.389 --> 16:30.908
Christy!

16:30.909 --> 16:32.669
Whoa. How's business?

16:33.949 --> 16:35.308
Mustn't grumble.

16:35.309 --> 16:38.148
Yes, well, um,
I'm glad I've caught you.

16:38.149 --> 16:40.028
I'm a little confused.

16:40.029 --> 16:43.027
I seem to recall that you said
you were asleep on the train,

16:43.028 --> 16:45.989
yet I believe you provided
Annie Mace with an alibi?

16:47.109 --> 16:49.588
I'm a Christian man, Father.

16:49.589 --> 16:51.709
I've never once spoken
to that woman.

17:10.069 --> 17:12.627
I've brought you some provisions!

17:12.628 --> 17:16.868
Chunk of cheese...
couple of tins of apricots. Hm?

17:24.108 --> 17:25.989
Just till you find your feet, eh?

17:27.029 --> 17:30.988
Ta. I'm as parched as the Sahara.

17:30.989 --> 17:35.148
Might I trouble you for a cup
of tea? My taps don't work.

17:35.149 --> 17:38.347
Would you like me to see if I could
do anything about that?

17:38.348 --> 17:41.669
As long as you're not here to ask me
any more stupid questions!

17:51.349 --> 17:53.548
Where's Mrs McCarthy?

17:53.549 --> 17:55.308
In the hospital.

17:55.309 --> 17:57.989
She wants the man
to have company when he wakes.

18:01.429 --> 18:02.469
Ahh!

18:06.389 --> 18:07.708
Ah.

18:07.709 --> 18:09.549
Oh! Come on.

18:10.629 --> 18:11.749
OK.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.189
OK.

18:30.189 --> 18:31.709
You are like a doctor...

18:33.349 --> 18:35.069
face all serious.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.148
Yeah?

18:38.149 --> 18:42.149
If your hand went green
and fell off, it would be serious.

18:43.189 --> 18:46.188
Only half floor would get scrubbed!

18:46.189 --> 18:48.149
You're a funny Polish girl.

18:50.149 --> 18:52.788
You don't know I funny...

18:52.789 --> 18:53.829
you don't know me.

18:56.589 --> 18:59.508
It's... OK for us to share a joke.

18:59.509 --> 19:01.349
I never share joke with you.

19:05.629 --> 19:09.148
You ain't going to find
anything in there. Indeed.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.947
If they were
the man's missing clothes

19:10.948 --> 19:12.827
they've clearly burned
to a cinder.

19:12.828 --> 19:15.749
Oh, that's a shame, you're going
to have to take my word for it.

19:15.750 --> 19:18.068
But I did find something useful...

19:18.069 --> 19:20.349
at the post office.
Oi, that is private!

19:22.109 --> 19:24.309
A concerned worker passed it to me.

19:26.509 --> 19:29.868
"Dear Granny, thank you for socks.

19:29.869 --> 19:33.508
"If the police knock,
tell them you gave me 50 quid.

19:33.509 --> 19:36.028
"Sidney."

19:36.029 --> 19:41.508
A stripped man is pushed from
a train, you step off £50 richer.

19:41.509 --> 19:44.267
You robbed him. Things got
out of hand, didn't they?

19:44.268 --> 19:46.547
Thought pinning the blame
on a soft target like Annie

19:46.548 --> 19:47.707
would get you off the hook?

19:47.708 --> 19:49.669
Sorry, where does it say that
in the telegram?

19:49.670 --> 19:54.028
Sid, I'm giving you an opportunity
to tell the truth.

19:54.029 --> 19:56.669
The judge will go far easier
on you if you do.

19:59.469 --> 20:01.028
I didn't do anything.

20:01.029 --> 20:02.867
Well, the victim's getting better

20:02.868 --> 20:04.947
so, hopefully, he can confirm
that soon enough.

20:04.948 --> 20:07.307
Oh, that's good,
he'll put you straight then.

20:07.308 --> 20:10.267
In the meantime, you'll do your
defence a great deal of good

20:10.268 --> 20:11.907
if you let me take a look around.

20:11.908 --> 20:13.829
Shame you haven't got a warrant then.

20:22.669 --> 20:26.708
Just one more superhuman
effort and...

20:26.709 --> 20:27.789
Ah!

20:28.869 --> 20:30.109
Let there be water.

20:31.109 --> 20:33.708
Call the Pope, it's a miracle!

20:33.709 --> 20:36.429
So, you do believe, then? Steady on.

20:38.549 --> 20:41.069
I suspect you come
to church for more

20:41.070 --> 20:44.188
than just getting up
Mrs McCarthy's nose.

20:44.189 --> 20:46.549
Although, I can imagine
how that would appeal!

20:50.589 --> 20:53.989
Not everybody there wants
to judge you, you know?

20:53.990 --> 20:56.628
Do you believe in unicorns too?

20:56.629 --> 20:59.389
There's men in your parish turn
their noses up then visit me.

20:59.390 --> 21:00.948
Family men.

21:00.949 --> 21:03.547
That bank manager, he went too far,
I had to hurt him.

21:03.548 --> 21:07.309
Did anyone believe me?
Who visits you? Where do I start?

21:08.629 --> 21:12.748
Mr Parnell, Mr Croker -
all pillars of the community.

21:12.749 --> 21:13.868
Christy Nolan?

21:13.869 --> 21:15.867
Never even spoken to Christy Nolan.

21:15.868 --> 21:18.949
You seem anxious to defend someone
you've never spoken to.

21:22.149 --> 21:25.789
There were scratch marks on the
man's face. Did you do that, Annie?

21:27.069 --> 21:30.429
I'm not going back inside
for the likes of him. Likes of who?

21:30.430 --> 21:33.829
I said no questions!
Who is he? Look, GET OUT!

21:36.229 --> 21:38.067
Who is he Annie? What did he do?

21:38.068 --> 21:41.469
Dirty old priest. In all my time
I've never heard such filth.

21:41.470 --> 21:43.428
You ought to be ASHAMED!

21:43.429 --> 21:44.787
We were just talking.

21:44.788 --> 21:47.109
It's the talkers
with the sickest minds!

21:50.949 --> 21:52.549
Good morning to you.

21:56.349 --> 21:59.869
I believe the police
are doing everything they can...

21:59.870 --> 22:01.869
to locate your loved ones.

22:05.149 --> 22:08.989
Now, with a little more effort,
you could be awake by teatime

22:08.990 --> 22:12.549
and then, well,
we could be properly introduced.

22:14.949 --> 22:19.188
If, however, you wake after
four o'clock I shall not be here

22:19.189 --> 22:23.189
because my casserole
needs two hours on the stove.

22:32.269 --> 22:33.789
One moment, Bill.

22:42.509 --> 22:44.907
I just wanted to see how
Bill is bearing up.

22:44.908 --> 22:46.867
I thought I might read to him.

22:46.868 --> 22:51.147
It'll be the Bible that rouses him
from his coma, thank you very much.

22:51.148 --> 22:53.187
I'm sure there's room
for two to mop his brow.

22:53.188 --> 22:57.507
He's far too poorly to have his room
turned in to a Piccadilly Circus.

22:57.508 --> 22:59.747
I heard his health
has improved a great deal.

22:59.748 --> 23:03.227
The nurses tell me he's quite
dashing under his... injuries.

23:03.228 --> 23:05.509
I wonder what he was doing
on that train?

23:08.309 --> 23:10.588
Bill is a FAMILY man!

23:10.589 --> 23:14.149
Is being almost naked
in first class a family pursuit?

23:15.989 --> 23:17.309
What was that?

23:19.349 --> 23:21.188
Sweet Jesus!

23:21.189 --> 23:22.948
Oh, Bill! Bill!

23:22.949 --> 23:25.748
What? What?

23:25.749 --> 23:29.308
Well, don't just stand there,
get a doctor!

23:29.309 --> 23:30.589
Doctor! DOCTOR!

23:32.429 --> 23:33.949
'DOCTOR!'

23:42.069 --> 23:46.548
The window was wide open,
the pillow was on the ground.

23:46.549 --> 23:50.949
The doctor thinks it's unlikely
he'll survive such a heart attack.

23:53.069 --> 23:56.387
The culprit must have come back
to finish the job.

23:56.388 --> 23:59.749
Perhaps it was careless of me to
inform Sid of his improved health?

23:59.750 --> 24:02.948
For goodness' sake! It was not Sid.

24:02.949 --> 24:05.228
It wasn't Sid.

24:05.229 --> 24:07.429
Well, did you see
who attacked the man?

24:09.029 --> 24:11.907
Either of you? I may have done,
had I not been delayed.

24:11.908 --> 24:15.629
Inspector I must insist
that you speak to Christy Nolan

24:15.630 --> 24:17.588
and Annie Mace once more.

24:17.589 --> 24:19.068
They know something.

24:19.069 --> 24:21.629
They acted very strangely
when I questioned them.

24:21.630 --> 24:23.628
I've spoken to them already.

24:23.629 --> 24:26.269
Father has given you
valuable information

24:26.270 --> 24:29.148
and duty compels you to use it!

24:29.149 --> 24:33.908
Unless, of course, a nameless victim
isn't worth your best efforts?

24:33.909 --> 24:35.189
Is that the case?

24:36.349 --> 24:37.589
Inspector?

24:39.949 --> 24:44.788
All right, I'll speak to them,
one more time... but that's it.

24:44.789 --> 24:46.229
That's all we're asking.

25:05.989 --> 25:08.507
Is this payback for them
carriage clocks?

25:08.508 --> 25:12.229
You'll get off the hook, you always
do. You said you were asleep!

25:12.230 --> 25:13.348
I got confused.

25:13.349 --> 25:16.307
Ah, you got confused about
whether you were awake or not?

25:16.308 --> 25:19.467
I saw her come out of first class!
You'll be all right, Sid.

25:19.468 --> 25:20.789
Only if you tell the truth.

25:20.790 --> 25:23.868
I have! I'm a Christian man.

25:23.869 --> 25:26.707
He's at death's door. Now,
if he dies, I face a murder charge.

25:26.708 --> 25:29.189
Now you tell the Inspector
you got it wrong!

25:34.909 --> 25:37.629
Witness intimidation and no alibi
for the murder attempts.

25:37.630 --> 25:41.268
I'd say that was enough
for a search warrant.

25:41.269 --> 25:44.507
Sid! Thanks for sending
the Inspector round, Father.

25:44.508 --> 25:48.307
Annie said you'd been harassing her.
I did what you asked, now back off!

25:48.308 --> 25:49.467
I can't just do nothing!

25:49.468 --> 25:54.027
Because you're certain of Sid's
innocence because he's your friend.

25:54.028 --> 25:55.547
So I'm certain of his innocence?

25:55.548 --> 25:57.587
Conduct likely to cause
a breach of the peace

25:57.588 --> 25:59.107
is a serious of fence, Father.

25:59.108 --> 26:02.349
I've told Miss Mace and Mr Nolan
you won't be bothering them again.

26:07.669 --> 26:09.269
Oh, Father Franc?

26:10.949 --> 26:14.269
It's my duty to visit
with the sick. May I?

26:18.589 --> 26:22.548
Let's hope Bill is comfortable
with such familiarity.

26:22.549 --> 26:24.868
Well, he looks at peace.

26:24.869 --> 26:27.909
You presence has clearly been
of great comfort to him.

26:29.429 --> 26:32.549
You seem tired, Mrs McCarthy.
Why don't you go home and rest?

26:32.550 --> 26:34.908
I'll stay a while yet.

26:34.909 --> 26:36.988
He hasn't got much longer.

26:36.989 --> 26:41.188
Well, I am happy
to stay with him. No.

26:41.189 --> 26:44.788
He's grown accustomed to me,
I think, and, well...

26:44.789 --> 26:46.549
I'd like to be here when he...

26:48.229 --> 26:51.949
Maybe you do not wish to return
to the presbytery just yet?

26:53.309 --> 26:56.789
I'm sorry? Well, I imagine young
Susie may not have given you

26:56.790 --> 26:59.388
the warmest of welcomes...

26:59.389 --> 27:01.629
and... I must confess, neither did I.

27:02.829 --> 27:06.109
But you mustn't take her cold front
too much to heart.

27:06.110 --> 27:08.268
Losing her father in the war...

27:08.269 --> 27:13.149
She's not one to make a fuss
but those scars run very deep.

27:14.949 --> 27:16.188
Look again!

27:16.189 --> 27:17.789
There's nothing here, sir!

27:25.829 --> 27:29.189
Now... what would Sid have to pawn?

27:30.389 --> 27:32.589
Rag and bone!

27:34.189 --> 27:35.549
Whoa.

27:36.909 --> 27:40.668
Inspector says I'm to call
if you harass me, Father.

27:40.669 --> 27:42.868
Wouldn't dream of it!

27:42.869 --> 27:45.709
I wanted to sell you a painting.
One of mine.

27:45.710 --> 27:47.748
All right, then.

27:47.749 --> 27:51.629
St Michael.
An inspiration to us all. Indeed.

27:52.629 --> 27:56.988
None of us are holy
and we all have battles to face.

27:56.989 --> 28:01.149
But holiness is what we mortals
must strive for, Father.

28:03.669 --> 28:06.269
Many of the saints lived
scandalous lives...

28:07.589 --> 28:10.027
it was only when they were
most burdened

28:10.028 --> 28:13.069
that they found the grace
to turn their lives around.

28:14.309 --> 28:17.909
You must get very lonely riding
around on that cart all day?

28:19.229 --> 28:22.149
We all know how much
you miss your mother.

28:22.150 --> 28:24.708
Perhaps in your loneliness...

28:24.709 --> 28:27.629
you have sought company? No.

28:28.709 --> 28:30.989
Perhaps you sought
company from Annie...?

28:32.709 --> 28:35.469
And feel pressured to provide her
with an alibi

28:35.470 --> 28:40.229
so that she doesn't reveal
your relationship? Christy...

28:41.229 --> 28:43.828
I won't tell anybody!

28:43.829 --> 28:47.548
Put the phone down.
Police, please. Christy...

28:47.549 --> 28:49.948
find strength in honesty.

28:49.949 --> 28:53.988
They're asking if a crime
is being committed now.

28:53.989 --> 28:55.269
Well, um...

28:56.509 --> 28:59.109
Mm. Yes, it's an emergency!

29:08.149 --> 29:10.189
I know what happened now, Susie.

29:12.269 --> 29:13.509
About what?

29:15.429 --> 29:16.709
Your father...

29:18.229 --> 29:19.828
I'm so sorry.

29:19.829 --> 29:21.788
Why?

29:21.789 --> 29:24.429
It wasn't you, was it? No.

29:25.709 --> 29:27.908
But, um...

29:27.909 --> 29:30.829
you feel guilty even
looking at me, don't you?

29:31.869 --> 29:33.269
You do not understand.

29:33.270 --> 29:34.749
Of course I do!

29:35.869 --> 29:37.709
I've buried many friends...

29:38.989 --> 29:40.708
and family.

29:40.709 --> 29:41.989
You lost people?

29:46.349 --> 29:47.589
And...

29:48.989 --> 29:51.468
the ones who survive...

29:51.469 --> 29:53.469
people I love, good people...

29:54.829 --> 29:58.029
they're hated by you - everyone.

30:09.269 --> 30:10.709
I don't like to hate...

30:12.269 --> 30:15.309
but we can not pretend
nothing happened.

30:17.869 --> 30:20.949
But we can stop it from killing
all that is good in us...

30:21.949 --> 30:23.869
or else they all died for nothing.

30:27.509 --> 30:31.109
So long time I wait
to feel better...

30:34.589 --> 30:36.189
I miss my parents.

30:38.229 --> 30:39.669
Ja.

30:40.709 --> 30:42.149
I miss my family too.

30:47.989 --> 30:51.309
But maybe something good
will come from all that bad?

31:09.709 --> 31:12.349
We retrieved this
from the pawnbroker...

31:14.789 --> 31:19.468
funny thing is, it's covered
in the man's fingerprints...

31:19.469 --> 31:20.789
and yours.

31:27.149 --> 31:29.587
Right, I'll tell you the truth.
You've had your chance.

31:29.588 --> 31:31.547
No, look, I found it in a bin.
Of course you did.

31:31.548 --> 31:33.869
This is why I couldn't
be honest with you!

31:33.870 --> 31:35.588
Sid. Don't.

31:35.589 --> 31:36.947
Do not do this to me.

31:36.948 --> 31:39.429
I've no choice but to charge you
with attempted murder.

31:43.349 --> 31:46.349
It's hardly a breach of the peace.
I was only talking.

31:46.350 --> 31:49.588
The inspector made himself clear,
Father.

31:49.589 --> 31:51.149
Let's not be too hasty.

31:51.150 --> 31:52.428
Father Brown...

31:52.429 --> 31:55.587
you harassed Christy Nolan
despite being warned not to.

31:55.588 --> 31:57.507
This will be used as evidence.

31:57.508 --> 32:02.029
If you give me any further cause
to charge you... Sid is innocent.

32:02.030 --> 32:04.908
Sid's prints are
on the man's wallet.

32:04.909 --> 32:07.549
He gave a false statement,
threatened a witness,

32:07.550 --> 32:10.068
he asked his granny to lie... Hmm.

32:10.069 --> 32:13.187
And he has no alibi
for either murder attempt.

32:13.188 --> 32:15.707
You're heading for
a criminal record yourself,

32:15.708 --> 32:18.187
what more is it going to take
before you accept the truth?

32:18.188 --> 32:20.867
There must be
a reasonable explanation.

32:20.868 --> 32:25.547
If it wasn't Sid in that cell you'd
believe their guilt as much as I do.

32:25.548 --> 32:28.707
There's a poor man at death's door,
his family deserves justice.

32:28.708 --> 32:30.789
You're trying to stop them
getting that.

32:30.790 --> 32:32.428
The truth is...

32:32.429 --> 32:34.309
Sid went too far this time.

32:36.749 --> 32:39.109
Tell the judge
he's a good boy at heart.

32:52.229 --> 32:53.948
Where is Sid?

32:53.949 --> 32:56.029
I'm afraid he may not
be coming back.

32:56.030 --> 32:57.069
No!

32:59.189 --> 33:02.027
I'll talk to Annie.
Find out what she knows.

33:02.028 --> 33:05.789
It's best we let the police
do their job. How can you say that?

33:05.790 --> 33:10.508
Maybe, maybe Annie's boyfriend
do it, maybe he is big thug?

33:10.509 --> 33:14.428
Boyfriend? I don't know him,
she keep secret.

33:14.429 --> 33:17.029
Annie didn't have a boyfriend
on the train...

33:18.709 --> 33:20.189
Of course!

33:21.589 --> 33:23.389
Where's Mrs McCarthy?

33:33.149 --> 33:36.869
We have bags of highly desirable
antiques from our spring clean

33:36.870 --> 33:38.268
in the kitchen.

33:38.269 --> 33:40.148
Mass is about to start.

33:40.149 --> 33:43.309
This fiasco hardly counts
as the Sabbath. Come along!

33:44.749 --> 33:46.309
I feel sick.

33:48.229 --> 33:52.588
If you don't come to Mass,
people might say that you push man.

33:52.589 --> 33:53.749
You want that?

33:55.589 --> 33:58.949
Come, we'll make you some tea first,
calm your nerves.

34:00.229 --> 34:02.949
I'll give you a shilling
for the lot.

34:08.629 --> 34:10.828
I'm going to the police!

34:10.829 --> 34:13.427
Sid has been charged,
he's on his way to court,

34:13.428 --> 34:15.306
the police are confident
of their case

34:15.308 --> 34:17.429
and, if the man dies, Sid will hang.

34:20.228 --> 34:23.627
You attacked a man before.
That was self defence, I told you!

34:23.628 --> 34:25.867
Prostitutes are not known
for their honesty.

34:25.868 --> 34:28.629
Don't you dare talk to her
like that! Forgive me.

34:30.589 --> 34:34.549
You gave her an alibi because
she's your girlfriend, isn't she?

34:35.708 --> 34:37.469
Christy don't like that word.

34:37.469 --> 34:39.828
I won't tell anybody...

34:39.829 --> 34:43.069
but I need to know the truth
about the man.

34:45.109 --> 34:48.708
Do you want Sid's death
on your conscience?

34:51.069 --> 34:54.108
The man pulled me into his carriage.

34:54.109 --> 34:56.987
Must have known my sort,
thought I was fair game.

34:56.987 --> 34:59.307
I scratched him, ran, but that's all!

34:59.308 --> 35:02.667
What happened then, Christy?
Did you confront him?

35:02.668 --> 35:04.869
She didn't tell me
till we got off the train.

35:04.870 --> 35:07.268
I didn't want any bother.

35:07.269 --> 35:10.349
I didn't think telling a fib
would get Sid in trouble.

35:12.909 --> 35:15.948
Will you tell the truth
to the Inspector?

35:15.949 --> 35:18.349
I'm sure he'll be discrete
and it would help Sid.

35:23.029 --> 35:26.587
I did want to tell you but I didn't
think you'd believe me,

35:26.588 --> 35:28.349
what with the man's standing.

35:28.350 --> 35:29.389
Standing?

35:33.509 --> 35:35.469
Bad things have happened...

35:36.749 --> 35:37.789
but...

35:40.189 --> 35:42.309
good things can come from bad.

35:43.829 --> 35:46.789
Peace... can end pain...

35:48.509 --> 35:51.789
hating your enemy
does not bring your enemy pain,

35:51.790 --> 35:54.748
it brings us pain.

35:54.749 --> 35:58.189
It stops us from receiving love.

36:02.029 --> 36:03.309
To quote Sunday's...

36:05.429 --> 36:06.469
hymn...

36:08.909 --> 36:11.867
And it's the message of the mass
each week to go in peace,

36:11.868 --> 36:13.109
loving God and what?

36:20.349 --> 36:23.989
To go in peace,
loving God and, what, Father?

36:26.749 --> 36:28.389
Um, well...

36:30.109 --> 36:35.108
I-in Germany, the expression
is to go in peace, loving God

36:35.109 --> 36:37.389
and... be fruitful.

36:38.509 --> 36:40.308
Fruitful?

36:40.309 --> 36:44.069
The Roman Catholic Church urges
"fruitfulness" on the faithful?

36:45.469 --> 36:49.469
What cultish gibberings
is he spreading in the Lord's house?

36:49.470 --> 36:52.308
By night, he revels in...

36:52.309 --> 36:54.508
unholy affections...

36:54.509 --> 36:56.388
by day he mocks the creed.

36:56.389 --> 37:00.709
Is this what passes for
a Catholic priest in Germany?

37:12.949 --> 37:16.548
What's happening?!
Call the police to the hospital.

37:16.549 --> 37:17.909
Forgive me, Lord.

37:35.909 --> 37:38.629
There were little signs
along the way...

37:38.630 --> 37:42.188
your blasphemy when you saw the body

37:42.189 --> 37:44.588
and your subsequent unease.

37:44.589 --> 37:47.989
And then, of course,
your fondness for Susie.

37:49.069 --> 37:50.828
He's Father Franc...

37:50.829 --> 37:52.149
and who are you?

37:57.229 --> 37:58.389
I am no-one any more.

37:59.589 --> 38:01.668
You are a man...

38:01.669 --> 38:03.668
with a free will.

38:03.669 --> 38:05.309
Responsible for your actions.

38:05.310 --> 38:07.628
He never took responsibility.

38:07.629 --> 38:11.509
As things stand...
you are no better than him.

38:12.949 --> 38:14.908
Yes, I am!

38:14.909 --> 38:16.709
Then put that pillow down...

38:18.189 --> 38:19.309
and confess.

38:30.429 --> 38:32.389
My name is Wilhelm...

38:34.669 --> 38:37.268
I was a doctor.

38:37.269 --> 38:41.828
I was put in prison
for opposing the Nazis...

38:41.829 --> 38:46.748
and then HE slaughtered my wife
to punish me.

38:46.749 --> 38:48.748
Just because he could.

38:48.749 --> 38:50.109
I'm so sorry.

38:51.749 --> 38:55.667
I did everything the right way,
I campaigned for his capture

38:55.668 --> 38:57.349
but he denied everything...

38:58.349 --> 39:02.828
and then I found out he'd worked
his way into the Priesthood.

39:02.829 --> 39:04.629
And you followed him here?

39:07.189 --> 39:09.149
All the way from Germany...

39:20.309 --> 39:24.148
'..and there he was...
Franz Prepffler -

39:24.149 --> 39:26.188
'Nazi...

39:26.189 --> 39:27.708
killer...

39:27.709 --> 39:28.749
monster.'

39:35.229 --> 39:36.909
He didn't remember me...

39:38.629 --> 39:41.748
'..but his pride
was too great to resist.

39:41.749 --> 39:46.388
'I praised the glorious Nazis,
their courage,

39:46.389 --> 39:48.029
'and he soon joined in.'

39:49.389 --> 39:54.589
He was... so... proud of his cruelty.

39:55.909 --> 39:57.788
I could listen to no more.

39:57.789 --> 40:01.509
He killed my wife,
he would tell the truth...

40:03.509 --> 40:06.949
'..but... he just laughed at me...'

40:12.469 --> 40:14.269
The red mist descended.

40:19.429 --> 40:23.988
'I thought I'd killed him.
It was not what I'd intended.'

40:23.989 --> 40:26.909
But I needed to get off the train
so I stripped him,

40:26.910 --> 40:28.668
I took his cassock.

40:28.669 --> 40:32.309
It's hard to catch a killer when you
don't know who the victim is.

40:35.749 --> 40:38.669
'So I pushed him from the train.'

40:41.109 --> 40:43.708
'I found Prepffler's wallet.

40:43.709 --> 40:45.347
'I didn't want his money.

40:45.348 --> 40:48.107
'Even wearing his clothes
made me sick.'

40:48.108 --> 40:49.829
'Trust Sid to sniff it out.'

40:52.789 --> 40:54.269
'I wanted to get away...'

40:56.109 --> 40:57.348
There he is.

40:57.349 --> 40:59.268
'..But there you were.'

40:59.269 --> 41:01.068
Father Franc, I presume?

41:01.069 --> 41:02.348
Father Brown.

41:02.349 --> 41:06.749
I just wanted him to regret
what he had done.

41:09.509 --> 41:12.187
When he was found in that tree,
I had to stay and finish it.

41:12.188 --> 41:13.347
He knew who I was.

41:13.348 --> 41:15.589
You tried to kill him
yesterday? Ja.

41:15.590 --> 41:17.669
Du...

41:20.509 --> 41:22.469
It is his heart.

41:25.989 --> 41:27.989
Your enemy's life or your liberty?

41:27.990 --> 41:31.628
No I can't,
I can't go back to prison.

41:31.629 --> 41:34.948
What kind of man are you?
Killer or Doctor?

41:34.949 --> 41:36.789
I'm not like him! Prove it.

41:52.269 --> 41:53.549
What are you doing?

41:53.550 --> 41:55.829
Trust me, it's his only chance.

42:00.989 --> 42:02.309
Come on!

42:06.229 --> 42:07.989
He has a rhythm.

42:13.669 --> 42:15.347
You did the right thing. 'Police!'

42:15.348 --> 42:17.829
He was never going to say sorry,
I must have known that.

42:17.830 --> 42:19.828
Police, open this door!

42:19.829 --> 42:21.348
I almost killed a man.

42:21.349 --> 42:23.107
I don't see an evil man
in front of me.

42:23.108 --> 42:25.507
I see a man who has suffered more
than I can comprehend.

42:25.508 --> 42:27.709
How you live your life
from this moment onwards

42:27.710 --> 42:29.748
is what really matters.

42:29.749 --> 42:31.509
Open this door, now!

42:34.789 --> 42:35.829
Open...

42:39.429 --> 42:41.069
Where's the priest?

42:42.749 --> 42:45.149
That's him, there.

42:51.109 --> 42:53.789
I thought you might like
a nice cup of tea?

42:55.109 --> 42:58.428
It's true, you lusted after a priest

42:58.429 --> 43:01.989
but, in the end, it turned out
he wasn't a priest, so no harm done!

43:03.029 --> 43:06.708
Our brave hero
of false imprisonment returns.

43:06.709 --> 43:09.988
Ah, well, now, next time
you find a wallet...

43:09.989 --> 43:13.029
I know, I know...
..you be sure and hand it in!

43:13.030 --> 43:16.469
I heard you bought
some friezes for a Nazi.

43:17.629 --> 43:21.988
Yes, but he was arrested
before he had time to enjoy them.

43:21.989 --> 43:25.869
Mrs McCarthy, why don't you make Sid
a nice, soothing cup of tea? Mm.

43:31.309 --> 43:35.629
Brakowalo mi twojego usmiechu...?

43:40.229 --> 43:41.949
I missed your smile too.

43:50.669 --> 43:54.028
Don't think that your friendship
wasn't real.

43:54.029 --> 43:58.028
I'm sure Wilhelm
cared for you a great deal.

43:58.029 --> 43:59.788
I hope so.

43:59.789 --> 44:05.108
Rag and bone!
Any rag and bone!

44:05.109 --> 44:06.549
Yeah, it's me.

44:07.589 --> 44:10.308
Cat got your tongue?

44:10.309 --> 44:14.228
They don't care that people talk?
Not any more.

44:14.229 --> 44:15.789
They look so happy.

44:17.309 --> 44:19.109
You will be too. Given time.

44:20.869 --> 44:24.149
I hope you don't mean Sid?
Sid? Sid who?!

44:25.589 --> 44:27.348
Father...

44:27.349 --> 44:28.949
No, of course not.
