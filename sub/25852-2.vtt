<i>[Although inspired by true events,
the characters and cases are fictional.]</i>

01:03.800 --> 01:05.910
I'll tell you something funny.

01:07.080 --> 01:10.490
Do you know how
Inuit people catch wolves?

01:10.490 --> 01:13.730
They stick their spears into
the ground on the coldest day.

01:13.730 --> 01:16.530
And they bloody it with the blood
of an animal they just killed.

01:16.530 --> 01:19.370
The exhausted and hungry
wolves will approach it.

01:19.370 --> 01:23.360
Not even realizing their tongues are
getting cut, they'll lick at the blood.

01:23.360 --> 01:24.830
And in the end...

01:26.440 --> 01:28.900
What do you think happens?

01:32.090 --> 01:35.050
Its tongue gets cut off, and it dies.

01:35.840 --> 01:37.770
Just like you.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.890
What are you doing?

01:50.890 --> 01:52.960
- Stop!
- Let go.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.960
Stop, it's too late!

02:06.240 --> 02:09.759
We found someone next to
the car we've been tracking!

02:09.759 --> 02:11.140
We need the rescue squads...

02:11.140 --> 02:14.610
The tow truck Jang Soo Bok was driving
hit a guardrail and fell down.

02:14.610 --> 02:17.380
Because Do Kang Woo
chased him too closely?

02:17.380 --> 02:21.310
Yes, that's possible.

02:23.130 --> 02:25.500
This jerk, again...

02:33.430 --> 02:35.140
Excuse me!

02:38.290 --> 02:40.110
That's dangerous!

02:55.400 --> 02:57.560
- Seriously...
- Are you crazy?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.200
Let go!

03:04.000 --> 03:06.380
The engine sounds dangerous.

03:06.380 --> 03:08.280
It may blow up!

03:08.280 --> 03:10.800
The car will blow up.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.670
Let go!

03:17.830 --> 03:19.390
Damn it!

03:23.890 --> 03:26.200
You know what you just did?

03:26.200 --> 03:30.700
You just destroyed the accelerating
device the real culprit installed!

03:30.700 --> 03:33.600
What are you saying?
Why would Jang Soo Bok...

03:33.600 --> 03:36.060
<i>Director, according to Agent Jin</i>

03:36.060 --> 03:40.160
Jang Soo Bok is computer illiterate,
there must be someone else behind him.

03:40.160 --> 03:45.210
<i>Then the real culprit killed him
knowing that we were after him?</i>

03:45.210 --> 03:48.940
- His heartbeat is dropping.
- Where's the ambulance?

03:48.940 --> 03:51.520
Where's the damn ambulance?

03:51.520 --> 03:53.750
Get Jang Soo Bok to talk

03:53.750 --> 03:57.280
and arrest Do Kang Woo
as the suspect in this case!

03:57.280 --> 03:59.620
But we don't have a warrant...

03:59.620 --> 04:01.520
Just put him away!

04:02.540 --> 04:05.450
I'll get the warrant from the prosecutor.

04:05.450 --> 04:11.750
I'll make sure he's dismissed for good
this time, no matter what it takes.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.450
<i>Yes, Sir.</i>

04:21.279 --> 04:25.280
You have no right to die.
Open your eyes.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.610
Open your eyes!

04:26.610 --> 04:29.630
It's that bastard
from three years ago, right?

04:29.630 --> 04:33.780
Stop yelling. I did it all by myself.

04:33.780 --> 04:36.760
Don't give me that.
You didn't do this alone.

04:36.760 --> 04:39.550
He put you up to it.
Come on, say it!

04:39.550 --> 04:41.190
What are you doing?
He already confessed!

04:41.190 --> 04:44.800
<i>His vocal cords are damaged by
the fire, but his voice is still stable.</i>

04:44.800 --> 04:47.550
<i>He must believe in what he's saying.</i>

04:47.550 --> 04:49.440
Let go of me!

04:49.440 --> 04:53.240
- What's going on?
- He already confessed he did it

04:53.240 --> 04:55.760
but he keeps trying
to accuse him otherwise.

04:55.760 --> 04:58.060
Please stop!

04:58.060 --> 05:02.030
We were just told they found
evidence at Jang Soo Bok's house.

05:02.030 --> 05:06.030
If you hadn't tailgated him like that,
this wouldn't have happened.

05:06.030 --> 05:10.360
- What?
- You're under arrest. Get him.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.990
What did you say? Let go!

05:12.990 --> 05:14.700
Let go!

05:15.390 --> 05:17.700
Do you even know what you just did?

05:17.700 --> 05:20.780
You just lost the psycho who
finally came back after three years.

05:20.780 --> 05:24.770
He'll hunt people for the next month,
then disappear again.

05:24.770 --> 05:28.700
Because of you,
many innocent people will die!

05:28.700 --> 05:31.260
Idiots.

05:31.260 --> 05:33.920
You call yourselves cops?

05:34.150 --> 05:35.860
What is he saying?

05:37.480 --> 05:42.770
<i>And he threatened to kill anyone who
messed with him. He's a complete lunatic.</i>

05:42.770 --> 05:45.780
<i>He definitely had anger issues
towards cops and others.</i>

05:45.780 --> 05:48.220
<i>He's lived as a loner</i>

05:48.220 --> 05:51.490
<i>and the culprit could have
manipulated that to approach him.</i>

05:51.490 --> 05:54.240
Mr. Jang Soo Bok, listen carefully.

05:54.240 --> 05:58.390
The man who put you up to this
was the first to ever help you, right?

06:02.590 --> 06:05.590
<i>Stop acting like you know.</i>

06:07.260 --> 06:10.200
"You know nothing."

06:10.200 --> 06:14.880
Yeah, I don't know much,
but I do know he was trying to kill you.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.380
Right?

06:21.000 --> 06:24.460
<i>What's going on?
His voice just went quiet.</i>

06:28.470 --> 06:30.510
<i>I can't hear his voice.</i>

06:30.510 --> 06:32.350
<i>What is he saying?</i>

06:36.380 --> 06:38.760
"My friend is here."

06:38.760 --> 06:40.800
"The hunt will begin."

06:41.890 --> 06:43.800
The hunt?

06:43.800 --> 06:46.330
What do you mean by the hunt?
What do you mean?

06:46.330 --> 06:48.130
Are you saying he's here?

06:48.130 --> 06:51.210
What's his name?
Does he live in Poongsan?

06:53.070 --> 06:56.210
<i>He reacted when I asked
if he lives in Poongsan.</i>

06:56.210 --> 06:58.580
<i>What's this sound?</i>

06:58.580 --> 07:02.300
<i>After the snapping sound began,
he began to laugh.</i>

07:02.300 --> 07:06.200
<i>"My friend is here"...
Is he around here now?</i>

07:10.390 --> 07:14.040
<i>I'm sure there's an accomplice,
one who made Jang Soo Bok to do all this.</i>

07:14.040 --> 07:17.660
<i>He made Jang Soo Bok believe in him
even at the moment of his death.</i>

07:17.660 --> 07:20.340
He's here now, right?

07:20.340 --> 07:23.050
Answer me! Where is he?

07:23.250 --> 07:25.660
Where is he? Answer me!

07:25.660 --> 07:27.820
- Where is he?
- What are you doing?

07:27.820 --> 07:31.130
Calm down, please don't do this.

07:33.890 --> 07:37.480
- Locate Jang Soo Bok's home and go.
- Look at you.

07:39.800 --> 07:43.690
Even if we find his house,
the cops must have searched it already.

07:43.690 --> 07:47.200
When the second search is over,
they'll take some break time.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.700
Let's go in then.
I'm sure they missed something.

07:51.430 --> 07:54.450
Wait, there's something here!

07:54.450 --> 07:57.160
I think she's saying
there's something there.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.590
Yeah right, she's just trying
to act like she did something.

07:59.590 --> 08:05.220
Still, the fact that she came here
means she's got pretty good intuition.

08:05.220 --> 08:07.890
Maybe you should hear her out.
If it weren't for her...

08:07.890 --> 08:10.320
your handsome face would have burned up.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.010
Let go!

08:12.520 --> 08:15.800
- I have to get him.
- The engine sounds dangerous.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.480
It may blow up!

08:23.000 --> 08:25.040
Find out Jang Soo Bok's address.

08:26.770 --> 08:28.840
Director Kang!

08:31.500 --> 08:34.970
Jang Soo Bok... just died.

08:40.090 --> 08:44.200
<i>[8:00 p.m.: Suspect Jang Soo Bok
in Jang Kyung Hak's murder case dies.]</i>

08:59.490 --> 09:04.490
<i>[Voice 2]</i>

09:04.490 --> 09:05.720
<i>An unbelievable story.</i>

09:05.720 --> 09:08.600
<i>- All information revealed.
- After kidnapping little girls</i>

09:08.600 --> 09:14.010
<i>a teen murdered them. Apparently
he was part of an online community...</i>

09:14.010 --> 09:16.920
<i>Another shocking news story.</i>

09:17.550 --> 09:20.210
<i>[Episode 2:
The Hunt Begins]</i>

09:20.210 --> 09:22.260
<i>["There is no hunting
like the hunting of man..."]</i>

09:22.260 --> 09:25.660
<i>["and those who have hunted
armed men long enough and liked it"]</i>

09:25.660 --> 09:28.200
<i>["never care for
anything else thereafter."]</i>

09:28.200 --> 09:30.300
<i>[Ernest Hemingway]</i>

09:31.300 --> 09:34.940
Name, Do Kang Woo. Age 37.
Ranked as an inspector.

09:34.940 --> 09:38.350
He lived in Japan until he was in
the third grade, and moved to Korea then.

09:38.350 --> 09:42.410
He was a top detective, but he had
no social skills, so he had many enemies.

09:42.410 --> 09:47.740
And he read the culprits' minds so well
there were rumors he was a psychopath.

09:47.740 --> 09:49.430
- A psychopath?
- Yes.

09:49.430 --> 09:53.270
A 14-year-old addicted to video games
killed his grandmother

09:53.270 --> 09:55.250
and he was able to find
her corpse right away.

09:55.250 --> 09:59.810
And for another case, he found evidence
even the forensics team couldn't.

09:59.810 --> 10:04.090
- Who is the man that was next to him?
- His name is Kwak Dok Ki.

10:04.090 --> 10:08.370
Age 24. He has five records for fraud.
He seems to be the informant.

10:08.370 --> 10:11.400
- 24 years old?
- Director.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.850
I just received the report
on Poongsan case.

10:13.850 --> 10:17.470
According to the report, there is
no doubt Detective Do is the culprit.

10:20.590 --> 10:23.500
It's completely different
from Detective Do's statements.

10:23.500 --> 10:26.830
He denied receiving funds,
or even ever seeing an account.

10:26.830 --> 10:30.630
He says he had a fight with
Detective Na, and on his way back

10:30.630 --> 10:33.430
someone hit him from the back,
and when he regained consciousness

10:33.430 --> 10:37.840
<i>some big guy was cutting off a wrist
and putting it into a box with a star.</i>

10:37.840 --> 10:44.330
<i>A man about 173 centimeters tall
and wearing a mask was taking photos.</i>

10:44.330 --> 10:47.490
The main murder weapon,
pruning shears, disappeared.

10:47.490 --> 10:50.630
And a disabled man in a welfare facility
named Jo Young Suk

10:50.630 --> 10:54.340
confessed to it and committed suicide,
so Detective Do was released.

10:54.340 --> 10:56.740
<i>That bastard is more than
capable of doing that.</i>

10:56.740 --> 10:59.920
<i>But why did he let
Detective Do Kang Woo live?</i>

11:00.900 --> 11:03.620
Do Kang Woo's account into where
the alleged bribe money was sent...

11:03.620 --> 11:04.630
- Yes.
- Look into it.

11:04.630 --> 11:06.800
- Sure. Yes.
- And check Na Hyung Joon's account too.

11:08.930 --> 11:11.850
Director Kang, we just got a call
from Poongsan Police.

11:11.850 --> 11:15.370
They're starting the emergency briefing
on Mount Gang Oh case at 7:00 p.m.

11:15.370 --> 11:18.090
They'll conclude that Jang Soo Bok
was the sole culprit in the case.

11:19.490 --> 11:21.490
Yes, Chief Na.

11:21.490 --> 11:25.130
For now, there's not much change
from the first inspection.

11:25.130 --> 11:28.610
You should proceed with the briefing.
We'll call you if we find anything else.

11:28.610 --> 11:30.300
- Okay.
- Dok Ki.

11:30.900 --> 11:32.400
Let's go.

11:35.520 --> 11:39.990
- Yeah, are you okay?
- Let's go.

11:56.920 --> 11:58.500
What's this stench?

11:59.900 --> 12:03.050
Is there a dead body in there?

12:07.960 --> 12:11.140
Is this a dumpster?

12:16.800 --> 12:22.140
How could anyone live like this?

12:22.140 --> 12:24.340
<i>Only two months after
leaving the prison</i>

12:24.340 --> 12:27.410
<i>he was assigned this mission,
and he threw himself a party.</i>

12:27.410 --> 12:32.730
<i>I'm sure he thought he would
just have to do as he was told.</i>

12:40.910 --> 12:44.110
Wow, he's got some good stuff.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.490
<i>He readjusted the pictures several
times to get the spacing perfect.</i>

13:03.990 --> 13:06.400
<i>He snuck in here to tape everything up.</i>

13:08.400 --> 13:11.470
<i>Typical of someone with OCD.</i>

13:22.900 --> 13:25.360
The landlord said
no one ever came by, right?

13:25.360 --> 13:29.700
Yeah, that the Chinese food delivery guy
is the only one who ever came by.

13:30.590 --> 13:32.530
<i>[Chinese Food: Gong Won Jang]</i>

13:32.530 --> 13:34.900
<i>We will start the emergency briefing</i>

13:34.900 --> 13:37.600
<i>on the kidnap and murder case
of Captain Jang Kyung Hak.</i>

13:43.080 --> 13:48.290
Last September, Jang Soo Bok was arrested
by the Seoungun Golden Time Team.

13:48.290 --> 13:53.540
Out of rage at the cops, particularly the
Golden Time Team, he planned the crime.

13:53.540 --> 13:58.040
Yesterday when the attempted bombing
happened at Samsu Station around 5 p.m.

13:58.040 --> 14:01.690
<i>he knew Captain Jang was off,
and would be leaving from his home.</i>

14:01.690 --> 14:04.660
<i>He attacked him with a taser,
and kidnapped him.</i>

14:04.660 --> 14:09.760
Director Kang of the 911 call center
spoke to him while commanding the case

14:09.760 --> 14:12.490
and though she sensed
something strange...

14:12.490 --> 14:15.680
she never followed up with him.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.990
Around 5:30 p.m.,
near a bus station at Mount Gang Oh

14:18.990 --> 14:23.080
Jang Soo Bok injected
the sedative Xanax into Captain Jang

14:23.080 --> 14:27.420
<i>paralyzing his body, and made it look as
if he had overdosed and caused the crash.</i>

14:27.420 --> 14:31.090
Knowing he could control acceleration
by hacking into the engine system

14:31.090 --> 14:34.510
he even posted about this online,
and planned out his crime.

14:34.510 --> 14:40.000
Further, he joined a hiking club
to gather information on the victims.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.250
I've never heard of such a wicked man
in the 30 years of my career.

14:43.250 --> 14:47.160
Don't drag this on.
We can't let a cop become a victim.

14:47.160 --> 14:49.730
Finish the necessary investigations,
and close the case.

14:49.730 --> 14:53.190
- Yes, I'll close it as soon as possible.
- Okay.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.960
Wait.

14:57.560 --> 15:00.560
I'm Director Kang Kwon Joo
from the Seongun 911 call center.

15:00.560 --> 15:03.190
Why are you ignoring
the possibility of an accomplice?

15:03.190 --> 15:05.090
According to Detective Do...

15:05.090 --> 15:07.810
the real culprit used Jang Soo Bok
and then killed him.

15:07.810 --> 15:11.990
And according to the prison records
on Jang, he was computer illiterate.

15:11.990 --> 15:14.990
It's doubtful he would be
able to post such expert info--

15:14.990 --> 15:16.780
Listen, Director Kang.

15:16.780 --> 15:21.880
Don't you know Do was the suspect in
the unsolved case from three years ago?

15:21.880 --> 15:27.730
He was released due to lack of evidence,
but everything about him is corrupt.

15:28.620 --> 15:32.590
Isn't the basis of all investigations
an unbiased standpoint?

15:33.990 --> 15:36.570
If we're missing out on this real culprit

15:36.570 --> 15:38.740
there will be more victims.

15:38.850 --> 15:42.790
You came here to prove that
my investigation was biased and faulty?

15:42.790 --> 15:44.490
Hey...

15:44.490 --> 15:47.400
That's enough.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.320
You're Director Kang Kwon Joo?

15:49.320 --> 15:53.020
I understand you are upset and hurt
at the loss of your partner.

15:53.020 --> 15:56.480
But the evidence here is very clear.

15:56.480 --> 16:00.300
And the case from three years ago
is very dear to our hearts.

16:00.300 --> 16:02.940
There are manners that should
be kept between officers.

16:02.940 --> 16:04.990
Please watch what you say.

16:04.990 --> 16:08.620
I think we're done here.
Let's wrap this up.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.560
Commissioner.

16:18.990 --> 16:22.590
I don't know what that punk said, but
he's got you wrapped around his finger.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.820
Watch what you say.

16:27.900 --> 16:29.170
What's this?

16:29.170 --> 16:34.120
You're the one who came here to ruin
my briefing, just by hearing Do's words!

16:34.120 --> 16:37.110
Do you even know anything about him?

16:37.110 --> 16:41.100
He was bribed
and he betrayed his partner...

16:42.300 --> 16:45.200
He murdered his partner...

16:45.200 --> 16:49.490
and in order to be reinstated,
he's digging around this case!

16:50.490 --> 16:51.930
He's the lowest of the low.

16:51.930 --> 16:55.100
I just saw the case report
on Detective Na before coming.

16:55.100 --> 16:59.800
A current officer consistently testified
that he saw an accomplice.

16:59.800 --> 17:03.230
Shouldn't you have tried to look
at the case from a different angle?

17:09.109 --> 17:13.200
Your guilty conscience
must be driving you mad.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.910
Do you think we're stupid?

17:14.910 --> 17:19.150
The day Do Kang Woo
beat up the guard and disappeared

17:19.150 --> 17:22.000
those pruning shears, the evidence
of that murder, also disappeared.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.099
And his mother's cafe debts
were paid off after that day, too.

17:26.099 --> 17:30.070
I thought you were competent,
hearing how successful your team is.

17:30.070 --> 17:31.580
How disappointing.

17:31.580 --> 17:34.860
All you do is sit around the center,
passing out orders.

17:34.860 --> 17:37.660
What would you know about
what happens at the scene?

17:38.490 --> 17:42.450
Just keep sitting around,
talking into the mic.

17:47.490 --> 17:51.900
<i>He's completely convinced Do Kang Woo's
guilty, it's impossible to convince him.</i>

17:53.780 --> 17:55.410
Are you okay?

17:55.410 --> 17:57.280
When is Do Kang Woo's
arrest warrant coming out?

17:57.280 --> 18:00.010
Prosecutor Han said
it will be issued soon.

18:00.010 --> 18:02.580
- Put him away as soon as it's out.
- Yes, Sir.

18:03.400 --> 18:07.210
- Hey, where is Captain Do right now?
- I know he's not at his house.

18:07.210 --> 18:11.100
Damn, do you think he went
to Jang Soo Bok's house?

18:11.100 --> 18:13.800
- I doubt that.
- You never know.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.030
Let's go.

18:21.790 --> 18:24.070
Agent Jin, did you find out
about the account?

18:24.070 --> 18:26.210
<i>I'm looking into it right now.</i>

18:26.210 --> 18:27.900
Okay, please hurry.

18:33.200 --> 18:37.850
- Yes, Detective Park.
- Director, I'm at the captain's funeral.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.890
His wife isn't doing too well.

18:42.890 --> 18:44.810
Okay.

18:47.490 --> 18:50.120
<i>Do you deliver often
to Greentel apartment 201?</i>

18:50.120 --> 18:55.490
Greentel apartment 201?
Oh man, he's the worst...

18:55.490 --> 18:57.690
He puts out all types of trash
with the empty plates

18:57.690 --> 19:00.620
and I hear the moaning
from his porn all the time.

19:02.490 --> 19:04.200
Nobody ever goes there to visit him?

19:04.200 --> 19:07.100
Who would go there?
That's a skin disease waiting to happen.

19:08.590 --> 19:12.180
But why do you ask?
He's done it, huh?

19:12.180 --> 19:14.630
He looks like a criminal.

19:18.600 --> 19:26.350
Actually, thinking about it...
I think someone did come to see him...

19:40.190 --> 19:43.190
If you mess around,
I'll break a bone.

19:43.190 --> 19:47.360
Why would I mess around
with you, Detective?

19:48.520 --> 19:53.440
A few days ago when it was pouring,
I went there for a delivery.

19:53.440 --> 19:57.510
His DVD player was broken,
so he asked me to fix it.

19:57.510 --> 20:02.410
I was so shocked.
Who watches porn on DVD anymore?

20:02.410 --> 20:04.900
And it was such perverted porn.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.530
Yeah.

20:14.530 --> 20:17.290
You're on patrol,
and you want to stop by?

20:17.290 --> 20:20.020
If I can't believe you,
who can I believe, Friend?

20:20.020 --> 20:23.230
And you're a cop at that. Yeah.

20:23.230 --> 20:26.250
<i>I thought he was a complete lowlife,
but apparently he had a cop friend.</i>

20:26.250 --> 20:28.220
He's got a cop friend?

20:28.220 --> 20:29.870
A cop?

20:30.870 --> 20:33.320
- Are you sure he said he's a cop?
- Yes.

20:33.320 --> 20:40.290
I'm sure he said, "You're on patrol,
and you want to stop by?"

20:41.790 --> 20:43.290
On patrol?

20:45.200 --> 20:47.800
- Anything else?
- That's all.

20:47.800 --> 20:51.550
I guess he noticed that I was listening,
and he told me to get out.

20:59.700 --> 21:02.790
If you think of anything else,
call me right away.

21:06.490 --> 21:10.800
<i>Knowing he despises cops, he disguised
himself as one, and approached him...</i>

21:15.530 --> 21:17.600
Dok Ki, the main culprit...

21:21.900 --> 21:25.300
Seriously, this lazy kid...

21:30.400 --> 21:33.080
Captain Do, for manslaughter of
Jang Soo Bok

21:33.080 --> 21:36.330
and for violating the public
officials act, you are under arrest.

21:37.950 --> 21:40.560
Don't you learn anything?

21:40.560 --> 21:42.090
Let go.

21:43.290 --> 21:45.920
We got the warrant from the court.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.410
Prosecutor Han is out to get you.

21:51.320 --> 21:54.800
- This will be tough for you.
- You're all losing your minds now?

21:55.900 --> 21:57.970
I said let go!

21:57.970 --> 21:59.590
You want a beatdown?

22:00.620 --> 22:04.700
Hey, you'll dislocate his shoulder.
You don't want that.

22:04.740 --> 22:07.410
- Damn.
- Come with us.

22:26.600 --> 22:29.150
You must have run over because of me.

22:29.150 --> 22:33.760
- No, don't...
- No, I have a lot to do.

22:38.490 --> 22:41.810
You got hurt trying to get him?

22:44.790 --> 22:46.560
I'm sorry.

22:46.560 --> 22:50.720
I should have called him right back...

22:50.720 --> 22:52.880
Don't say that.

22:52.880 --> 22:57.440
You made the right decision
as the director of the call center.

22:58.800 --> 23:03.200
When I was looking at my husband before,
I almost didn't recognize him.

23:04.290 --> 23:06.600
They say with that much
of the drug injected

23:06.600 --> 23:09.420
the body just gets completely paralyzed.

23:10.400 --> 23:15.130
<i>But to the point that his
capillaries burst all over his body...</i>

23:16.780 --> 23:20.300
he tried his best to turn the car.

23:21.910 --> 23:25.160
He must have wanted it that badly....

23:26.290 --> 23:29.400
To save those hikers.

23:39.490 --> 23:41.600
My husband...

23:43.290 --> 23:47.290
was so happy when he got the offer
to return to Golden Time Team.

23:49.100 --> 23:54.720
You and Captain Moo Jin Hyuk
gave him the chance to save lives

23:54.720 --> 23:59.230
and he was so grateful for that.

23:59.230 --> 24:01.300
So grateful.

24:16.490 --> 24:18.510
I should go out.

24:20.070 --> 24:22.340
We'll help you.

24:26.690 --> 24:29.200
Kwon Joo.

24:29.200 --> 24:32.290
Promise me one thing.

24:32.290 --> 24:35.240
Don't get hurt.

24:35.240 --> 24:39.960
And no matter what happens,
please protect the Golden Time Team.

25:05.230 --> 25:11.400
To the point that his
capillaries burst all over his body...

25:11.400 --> 25:14.490
he tried his best to turn the car.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.400
He must have wanted it that badly...

25:20.700 --> 25:24.620
To save those hikers.

26:00.790 --> 26:03.990
I heard the real culprit
may still be on the loose.

26:06.400 --> 26:08.320
Please get him.

26:09.530 --> 26:11.100
Please.

26:22.290 --> 26:27.900
<i>[Our captain who always gave his all.
- The Golden Time Team]</i>

26:37.290 --> 26:40.630
<i>I'll get you no matter what it takes.</i>

26:40.630 --> 26:42.850
<i>Don't forget it.</i>

26:42.850 --> 26:48.010
<i>I'll make you regret messing
with our Golden Time Team.</i>

26:53.970 --> 26:56.190
- Director Kang.
- Yeah, Agent Jin.

26:56.190 --> 26:58.000
<i>I looked into what you asked before.</i>

26:58.000 --> 27:02.790
It's true that unidentified funds came
into Do's account, but something's odd.

27:02.790 --> 27:07.410
<i>The day he opened his Daehan bank account
at Hawol Poongsan branch in February 2015</i>

27:07.410 --> 27:10.450
he was actually on
a business trip to Seoul.

27:10.450 --> 27:12.960
<i>And hearing how brilliant he was</i>

27:12.960 --> 27:15.920
<i>why would he transfer
the funds into his own account?</i>

27:15.920 --> 27:19.220
- Detective Na seems more suspicious.
- Suspicious?

27:19.220 --> 27:21.690
<i>He made a virtual account
three years ago for bitcoins.</i>

27:21.690 --> 27:26.390
<i>And the funds were withdrawn
on the day of his son's operation.</i>

27:26.390 --> 27:28.250
This is just speculation...

27:28.250 --> 27:34.730
<i>What if Detective Na stole his
partner's seal to open up an account</i>

27:34.730 --> 27:37.730
<i>and someone concealed that
fact during the investigation?</i>

27:37.730 --> 27:39.790
<i>Hold on...</i>

27:39.790 --> 27:42.950
<i>Then, to protect Detective Na's honor...</i>

27:42.950 --> 27:46.190
<i>did Detective Do conceal that fact?</i>

27:46.190 --> 27:48.670
<i>It's certainly possible.</i>

27:48.670 --> 27:52.850
<i>Then there's only one way
to get to the bottom of this case.</i>

27:54.720 --> 27:57.490
<i>I need to partner up with
the one who knows the truth.</i>

27:59.900 --> 28:03.710
Agent Park, find out
where Detective Do is right now.

28:03.710 --> 28:08.000
<i>The courts just issued a warrant for him.</i>

28:08.000 --> 28:11.250
He's in jail now after being arrested
in front of Jang Soo Bok's house.

28:11.250 --> 28:16.430
<i>Chief Na must have put him away for
interfering with Jang Soo Bok's case.</i>

28:16.430 --> 28:19.360
The warrant was issued by
Prosecutor Han Min Hyuk.

28:19.360 --> 28:23.540
<i>He was the one in charge of Na's case
three years ago, and he detests Do.</i>

28:23.540 --> 28:27.150
<i>After Do was released,
he lost his chance at a promotion.</i>

28:27.150 --> 28:29.380
<i>It seems like he's out to get him.</i>

28:29.380 --> 28:31.140
Okay.

28:35.200 --> 28:39.400
<i>Officer, why are we in jail?</i>

28:39.400 --> 28:41.900
Ask anybody on the streets.

28:41.900 --> 28:46.820
We were helping you to catch the culprit,
so how can you repay us like this?

28:46.820 --> 28:51.780
I'm talking, don't walk away.
Are you a thug or something?

28:51.780 --> 28:54.040
Damn...

28:58.400 --> 29:00.190
I'm dead...

29:03.350 --> 29:05.540
What a mess.

29:12.300 --> 29:16.850
Kang Woo, you're thinking of
a way to get out of here, right?

29:16.850 --> 29:19.740
Be quiet, don't bother me.

29:19.740 --> 29:24.960
I mean if the government finds out
we've been doing things in secret--

29:24.960 --> 29:28.030
- I told you to shut up.
- Yes.

29:28.030 --> 29:32.620
Captain Do, if you had stopped,
it wouldn't have gotten this far.

29:32.620 --> 29:34.990
What's this?

29:34.990 --> 29:39.200
Detective Yang,
just give me a week's time.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.880
I'll get that scumbag
if you give me a week.

29:41.880 --> 29:45.950
The only thing I can say to you
is to find a good lawyer.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.480
This is my first and last request.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.620
I'll get him in a week's time.

29:50.620 --> 29:54.060
- You know me, have I ever been wrong?
- That's exactly why.

29:54.060 --> 29:58.680
That's why I can't trust you.
Please acknowledge it.

29:58.680 --> 30:02.750
- Hey.
- It's all finished now.

30:02.750 --> 30:05.700
Hey. Hey!

30:07.160 --> 30:10.490
I need to get that psycho!

30:10.490 --> 30:13.490
Will you only come to your senses
after the cops get killed one by one?

30:13.490 --> 30:17.030
You may be his next target!

30:17.030 --> 30:18.950
Damn it!

30:18.950 --> 30:21.750
Seriously, that kid...
You don't know how to bow?

30:21.750 --> 30:23.510
Detective Yang.

30:26.440 --> 30:29.020
What is it now?

30:29.020 --> 30:32.400
- Could I talk to Detective Do Kang Woo?
- Do Kang Woo...

30:38.990 --> 30:40.340
Hyung Joon!

30:42.400 --> 30:46.200
Your anger will save you.

30:47.010 --> 30:49.270
Psycho bastard.

30:50.340 --> 30:53.040
I'll kill you myself.

30:55.990 --> 30:59.330
Be quiet, it's not like
you're here alone.

30:59.330 --> 31:02.720
You can't bang on it like that...

31:02.720 --> 31:04.750
Are you okay?

31:06.790 --> 31:12.850
Dok Ki, find out if there were any
officers from Opo that were out today.

31:12.850 --> 31:16.290
How am I supposed to
do that from here?

31:17.790 --> 31:19.990
Find a way.

31:19.990 --> 31:22.980
You're really something else.

31:22.980 --> 31:26.450
You don't see that we've got
a bigger issue at hand here?

31:28.160 --> 31:30.210
Detective Do Kang Woo.

31:30.210 --> 31:32.370
Let's talk.

31:32.370 --> 31:34.040
What do you want?

31:34.040 --> 31:35.900
Are you a stalker?

31:35.900 --> 31:37.790
I have nothing to say, so get lost.

31:37.790 --> 31:40.710
Who do you think
put me here in the first place?

31:44.290 --> 31:47.900
That culprit you witnessed
three years back...

31:47.900 --> 31:53.210
Didn't he used to snap on his
latex gloves and make this sound?

31:55.750 --> 31:57.450
Habitually.

31:59.990 --> 32:01.620
Give that to me.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.680
<i>How did she know?</i>

32:08.790 --> 32:11.080
<i>I don't think that was in the statements.</i>

32:13.400 --> 32:16.390
I see why people say
that you're peculiar.

32:16.390 --> 32:21.870
- Shouldn't you get that treated?
- Get to the point.

32:21.870 --> 32:24.610
Where did you hear about the glove?

32:25.520 --> 32:29.290
How did you find out
that the culprit wore gloves?

32:35.400 --> 32:38.330
I can hear sounds that others can't hear.

32:38.330 --> 32:45.200
When Jang Soo Bok was dying, I heard
the snapping of the latex gloves nearby.

32:45.200 --> 32:48.600
What? The snapping of the latex gloves?

32:52.200 --> 32:54.180
You want me to believe that?

32:54.180 --> 32:57.290
I'm sure you know,
if you've heard the rumors.

32:57.290 --> 33:00.290
If I lose it,
you won't be able to handle me.

33:01.400 --> 33:04.500
I told you, I heard with my ears.

33:08.490 --> 33:11.500
You're a pro at this.

33:11.500 --> 33:13.900
Are you a pathological liar?

33:14.900 --> 33:17.610
How dare you try to lie to me?

33:17.610 --> 33:24.840
If you can't believe me, I'll tell you
what you're touching inside your pocket.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.450
What?

33:29.440 --> 33:32.200
Two mercury batteries.

33:32.200 --> 33:36.790
I noticed from before that
your watch is ticking a little slow.

33:36.790 --> 33:39.290
Did you buy them
to change the watch battery?

33:39.900 --> 33:42.170
You've placed them
deep within your pockets

33:42.170 --> 33:44.990
that they didn't find it
during the body search.

33:44.990 --> 33:46.810
Who are you?

33:50.790 --> 33:52.290
Yeah, Agent Park.

33:52.290 --> 33:55.200
- Did you convince him?
- I'll have to wait now.

33:56.990 --> 34:00.910
To be honest, I'm a bit worried.

34:02.290 --> 34:06.900
Even if he's got the information,
he's got a very bad reputation.

34:06.900 --> 34:09.250
We have no other choice right now.

34:14.949 --> 34:16.699
Yes, Commissioner.

34:26.500 --> 34:31.199
<i>She came to get us out, right?</i>

34:31.199 --> 34:33.199
Kang Woo.

34:33.199 --> 34:35.710
Kang Woo, please answer me.

34:44.889 --> 34:46.770
- Secret investigation?
- Yes.

34:46.770 --> 34:50.110
Join the Golden Time Team
based in Poongsan

34:50.110 --> 34:53.010
and we will investigate in secret
to find the real culprit.

34:53.010 --> 34:54.960
I will get you reinstated

34:54.960 --> 34:58.740
and you will provide us with
all the info you have on the culprit.

34:58.740 --> 35:01.620
You'll override the arrest warrant
issued by the court?

35:01.620 --> 35:04.600
Hey, go look in the mirror.

35:04.600 --> 35:06.790
Who do you think you are?

35:06.790 --> 35:11.100
If I didn't think I could do that,
I wouldn't have come here.

35:11.100 --> 35:13.920
If you promise to join our team,
I'll get you out.

35:18.390 --> 35:21.010
You must have some magic button.

35:22.420 --> 35:23.480
And if I say no?

35:23.480 --> 35:26.160
You know you're in no situation to do so.

35:26.160 --> 35:29.590
It's clear you'll get a minimum
of a one-year sentence.

35:29.590 --> 35:33.890
And if I testify that you pushed
Jang Soo Bok off by chasing too closely

35:33.890 --> 35:36.030
you're looking at even more time.

35:44.290 --> 35:47.700
That kind of threat won't work with me.

35:47.700 --> 35:50.520
It's not a threat.
Let's call it an offer.

35:51.620 --> 35:55.160
Oh, one more thing.

35:55.160 --> 36:00.540
Detective Na Hyung Joon's
posthumous promotion will be revoked.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.910
What?

36:03.860 --> 36:08.330
You better watch what you say.
I don't know what you heard, but...

36:08.330 --> 36:13.630
The one who took bribes from Sokpo Resort
three years ago was not you.

36:13.630 --> 36:16.100
It was Detective Na Hyung Joon, right?

36:17.790 --> 36:22.780
I know you kept quiet so his widow could
get the pension to care for her sick son.

36:24.200 --> 36:28.000
Were you two friends?

36:30.700 --> 36:36.700
Maybe he was the first one
you ever opened up to?

36:38.000 --> 36:40.500
Don't you think your deceased partner...

36:41.790 --> 36:45.200
would think you look pathetic right now?

37:00.000 --> 37:02.200
Hey.

37:02.200 --> 37:05.910
You've got some talent
at pissing people off.

37:07.600 --> 37:10.820
Watch your back at night.

37:10.820 --> 37:14.550
What if someone comes
and smashes your head in from behind?

37:15.430 --> 37:19.800
Yeah, I'll use my talent to finish it.

37:20.790 --> 37:23.390
You've accomplished nothing going around
with that con man for three years.

37:23.390 --> 37:28.450
I'm sure I can get that murderer
quicker than you.

37:37.290 --> 37:43.020
Oh, I heard your partner trash-talking
you earlier, you should watch him.

38:08.450 --> 38:12.120
Kang Woo, please listen to me.

38:12.120 --> 38:15.790
You really need to listen to that woman.

38:15.790 --> 38:18.700
I don't know if you know...

38:18.700 --> 38:21.940
but she caught that serial killer,
Mo Tae Goo, last year.

38:21.940 --> 38:26.740
And she just got that man
who threatened to set off a bomb.

38:26.740 --> 38:31.900
If she's willing to help you,
just grab her hand.

38:31.900 --> 38:33.180
- Dok Ki.
- Yes?

38:33.180 --> 38:35.750
Did you trash-talk me
to those guys earlier?

38:35.750 --> 38:40.200
<i>I should really do something
about that punk...</i>

38:42.150 --> 38:44.290
Yes, I did.

38:44.290 --> 38:50.130
These thugs were asking if...
I mean these honorable men here...

38:50.130 --> 38:53.920
They were asking if I'm in here
because of you, so I just got worked up.

38:53.920 --> 38:56.600
So I did say a few things...

38:56.600 --> 39:00.880
If you're mad, come out and say it,
and bring me out with you.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.840
Wait.

39:05.840 --> 39:08.520
You heard me from all the way in there?

39:08.520 --> 39:12.000
You even have super hearing now?

39:12.000 --> 39:14.790
She can really hear those things?

39:15.700 --> 39:17.410
<i>- A secret investigation?
- Yes.</i>

39:17.410 --> 39:22.480
We'll run a pilot team from Poongsan
for a month for additional investigation.

39:22.480 --> 39:26.870
According to Jang Soo Bok, the culprit
will start his hunt within the month.

39:26.870 --> 39:31.230
He's much more cunning, intelligent,
and scary than Jang Soo Bok.

39:31.230 --> 39:35.450
The fact that I'm asking you
to join me on this difficult task...

39:35.450 --> 39:37.610
breaks my heart as the director.

39:37.610 --> 39:41.920
I'm at fault for
what happened to Captain Jang.

39:41.920 --> 39:45.100
But even in his very last moments

39:45.100 --> 39:48.950
he tried his best
to save at least one life.

39:48.950 --> 39:56.000
If you join me, I promise to get
that bastard who did that to the captain.

39:59.500 --> 40:04.500
Please tell me by tomorrow morning.
I'll respect your decision.

40:04.500 --> 40:06.390
That's all.

40:09.480 --> 40:11.030
- I'll join.
- I'll join.

40:11.030 --> 40:13.950
- Let's go together!
- It's not like we don't know

40:13.950 --> 40:16.130
so how can we not do anything
while knowing the truth?

40:16.130 --> 40:20.180
What's so hard about asking us that?
We're a team forever.

40:20.180 --> 40:24.360
Yeah, you weren't going to
leave alone, were you?

40:24.360 --> 40:26.710
I think she was.

40:29.050 --> 40:31.980
Thank you. Let's get through this.

40:32.890 --> 40:35.890
- Let's do this.
- Director.

40:35.890 --> 40:40.110
These are the files from Mount Gang Oh
at the time you mentioned

40:40.110 --> 40:42.750
but there was nobody
wearing latex gloves.

40:42.750 --> 40:46.130
Still, I'll look one more time.

40:46.130 --> 40:48.750
- Okay, thanks.
- Director.

40:48.750 --> 40:51.910
- Be strong.
- Thanks.

41:02.100 --> 41:05.200
<i>Yes, I'll use my talent to finish it.</i>

41:05.200 --> 41:08.500
You've accomplished nothing going around
with that con man for three years.

41:08.500 --> 41:12.980
I'm sure I can get that murderer
quicker than you.

41:12.980 --> 41:14.610
<i>We got the warrant from the court.</i>

41:14.610 --> 41:17.100
Prosecutor Han is out to get you.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.770
This will be tough.

41:18.770 --> 41:22.590
There are many things
you can manipulate in this world.

41:22.590 --> 41:26.810
For example, people who are
consumed by anger and disgust.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.660
Damn it.

41:30.970 --> 41:32.690
Get in there.

41:36.730 --> 41:39.600
Hey, Officer!

41:39.600 --> 41:41.420
Can I get my cell phone?

41:45.660 --> 41:48.170
That was sooner than I thought.

41:51.200 --> 41:53.210
Yes, okay.

41:58.780 --> 42:01.270
Commissioner Go, this is Kang Kwon Joo.

42:01.270 --> 42:04.350
I'm calling about
the request I made before.

42:04.350 --> 42:08.450
Chief, the arrest warrant for
Detective Do has been dismissed.

42:10.200 --> 42:11.240
What are you saying?

42:11.240 --> 42:15.880
They said it's unmerited to arrest
an officer on leave for making a mistake.

42:15.880 --> 42:18.440
They dismissed the warrant from above.

42:18.440 --> 42:22.210
I'm guessing the headquarters
put pressure on them.

42:22.210 --> 42:25.760
And I heard Detective Do Kang Woo

42:25.760 --> 42:30.900
was assigned as the captain
of the Golden Time Dispatch Team.

42:37.500 --> 42:39.990
Dispatch team captain?

42:46.770 --> 42:50.700
It was that woman,
Director Kang's doing, right?

42:52.700 --> 42:55.890
So she really wants to go at it, huh?

42:58.660 --> 43:02.100
You're telling me to catch that
psycho bastard within a month?

43:02.960 --> 43:08.450
If he was that easy,
I would have caught him already.

43:08.450 --> 43:10.290
I tried my best.

43:10.290 --> 43:13.410
You have enemies everywhere.
It was very hard to get you out.

43:13.410 --> 43:17.540
Still, how can you strangle me like this?

43:19.500 --> 43:23.080
If you keep doing this,
I'll just do it my way...

43:23.700 --> 43:26.760
Director Kang sent me
to escort you over.

43:26.760 --> 43:28.510
Let's go.

43:31.070 --> 43:34.100
You sent these lowlifes to guard me?

43:34.100 --> 43:37.250
Watch what you say.
They are your teammates.

43:37.250 --> 43:40.100
Until we build some trust,
we'll do things my way.

43:55.760 --> 43:58.230
Call me...

43:59.000 --> 44:01.050
What the heck...

44:04.510 --> 44:06.970
I'll give you that you're meticulous.

44:06.970 --> 44:10.700
I hate beating around the bush,
so get to the point.

44:12.620 --> 44:14.260
<i>[Notice of Personnel Appointment]</i>

44:14.260 --> 44:17.690
Start working next week as
Poongsan Golden Time Team's captain.

44:17.690 --> 44:21.580
As I said, it's only for a month.
I won't tolerate any kind of nonsense.

44:21.580 --> 44:25.000
If you cause another problem,
we'll get another warrant out.

44:31.470 --> 44:33.530
Fine.

44:34.700 --> 44:36.200
But under one condition.

44:36.200 --> 44:38.220
I'll be in charge of
running the dispatch team.

44:38.220 --> 44:40.410
First, no lazy asses.

44:40.410 --> 44:42.970
Second, no empathy.

44:42.970 --> 44:46.980
Third, if you have a problem
with work, don't whine to me.

44:46.980 --> 44:48.830
Go straight to the inspection team.

44:49.200 --> 44:51.290
Fine.

44:51.290 --> 44:53.560
Then share the information
that you have first.

44:55.790 --> 44:58.890
He committed six murders in
the month of June three years ago.

44:58.890 --> 45:01.770
This June, exactly three years later,
he started again.

45:01.770 --> 45:04.740
The victims were Jung Hye Ryun,
who attended the police academy.

45:04.740 --> 45:06.990
<i>Goo Ji Hye from the
store at the Guro Station.</i>

45:06.990 --> 45:09.640
<i>And Na Hyung Joon
from Poongsan Station.</i>

45:09.640 --> 45:13.330
All three victims were
related to the police in some way.

45:13.330 --> 45:16.060
The accomplices,
So Jang Ho and Jeon Hyuk Soo

45:16.060 --> 45:18.000
were also killed after the work was done.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.700
Including Captain Jang and Jang Soo Bok,
that's a total of eight killed to date.

45:23.790 --> 45:26.100
Jung Hye Ryun and Goo Ji Hye's cases

45:26.100 --> 45:28.100
had no evidence or witnesses
and they remain unsolved

45:28.100 --> 45:31.100
the murder weapon is
a custom-made pruning shear.

45:31.100 --> 45:33.600
He tells the accomplice
to cut off a body part

45:33.600 --> 45:36.190
and he puts it into a box with a star.

45:36.190 --> 45:39.290
When choosing an accomplice he picks
one with a grudge against the victim.

45:39.290 --> 45:44.190
Jung Hye Ryun called homeless alcoholic
So Jang Ho dirty, and lost her fingers.

45:44.190 --> 45:49.490
And Hyung Joon was beat to death by
Jo Young Suk who had a crush on his wife.

45:49.490 --> 45:55.090
- I had no idea it was this bad.
- No, I'm only starting.

45:56.790 --> 46:03.660
That bastard will hunt men for a month,
and then he'll disappear.

46:04.890 --> 46:11.180
He manipulates the anger and hatred
within people to commit murder.

46:11.180 --> 46:13.690
He's an evil villain.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.070
He's different from anyone
you've dealt with before.

46:19.890 --> 46:22.690
The next month will be very interesting.

46:32.750 --> 46:36.120
You said you'll keep your promise
while running the Golden Time Team

46:36.120 --> 46:41.810
so I'll grant the wish, but if you or the
team is in danger during investigation

46:41.810 --> 46:44.130
I'll use my power to stop it.

46:45.100 --> 46:48.470
- Can you promise me?
- Yes, Commissioner.

46:48.470 --> 46:50.820
I promise.

46:58.500 --> 47:01.790
<i>[How are you? Sorry I had to leave you.
You're in good hands with Captain Jang.]</i>

47:01.790 --> 47:03.700
<i>[From Moo Jin Hyuk]</i>

47:12.390 --> 47:16.350
<i>I heard you're traveling with Dong Woo,
so I'm emailing you.</i>

47:16.350 --> 47:20.820
<i>Captain Jang has been killed...</i>

47:20.820 --> 47:25.370
<i>I believe the culprit is in Poongsan,
so I've teamed up with a detective here</i>

47:25.370 --> 47:28.360
<i>to run a secret investigation
for a month.</i>

47:28.360 --> 47:32.820
<i>I'm worried the other team members
may be put in danger because of me.</i>

47:32.820 --> 47:38.100
<i>And I'm not sure the detective
I've teamed up with is trustworthy...</i>

47:52.870 --> 47:56.040
<i>Please contact me when you're back.</i>

48:04.500 --> 48:06.920
<i>Don't get weak, Kang Kwon Joo.</i>

48:06.920 --> 48:09.330
<i>You're the director
of the Golden Time Team.</i>

48:20.950 --> 48:23.070
<i>Captain Jang.</i>

48:24.790 --> 48:30.150
<i>I'll catch him and bring him to justice.</i>

48:30.150 --> 48:34.790
<i>Please rest in peace.</i>

50:57.100 --> 50:58.390
Hey.

50:58.390 --> 51:03.310
You know what my nickname is
at the Violent Crime Unit?

51:03.850 --> 51:06.020
Little Buddha.

51:06.880 --> 51:09.890
They've never seen anyone last
as long as I have working with you.

51:10.600 --> 51:13.200
If you're unhappy,
ask for a partner change.

51:13.200 --> 51:15.100
I don't want to.

51:15.100 --> 51:19.700
You may be a jerk, but I like you
because you get the bad guys.

51:21.200 --> 51:23.820
What are cops for?
We just need to get the bad guys.

51:23.820 --> 51:25.310
No?

51:26.200 --> 51:29.800
- Stop laughing, you'll grow on me.
- Hey, tell me the truth.

51:29.800 --> 51:34.350
You have a driver's license,
but you're too lazy to drive, right?

51:36.200 --> 51:37.920
I'm drinking yours.

51:49.700 --> 51:51.720
No!

51:54.160 --> 51:58.390
My son is sick.
Can you please turn a blind eye?

51:58.390 --> 52:01.450
I won't ever do it again, Kang Ho.

52:04.330 --> 52:07.640
Kang Ho, help...

52:12.260 --> 52:14.380
Hyung Joon...

52:30.500 --> 52:32.000
Hyung Joon.

52:34.170 --> 52:37.320
I won't stop at just getting him.

52:37.320 --> 52:40.450
I'll make sure he pays
for all the pain he caused you.

52:40.960 --> 52:43.000
<i>[Kwak Dok Ki]</i>

52:53.870 --> 52:55.370
Yeah, talk.

52:55.370 --> 52:58.570
<i>Kang Woo, I found out
about Director Kang.</i>

52:58.570 --> 53:02.100
She's 34 years old...
She looks great for her age, right?

53:06.000 --> 53:11.020
Her mom died when she was young, and
Mo Tae Goo killed her dad four years ago.

53:11.020 --> 53:12.270
<i>She lives alone.</i>

53:12.270 --> 53:16.660
<i>After assembling the Golden Time Team,
she's never taken a single vacation.</i>

53:16.660 --> 53:21.400
Oh, and Commissioner Go
from Seoul was her father's friend

53:21.400 --> 53:23.750
so there are rumors
that he's taking care of her.

53:23.750 --> 53:27.250
- What about Opo Station?
- Yeah, I got something big.

53:27.250 --> 53:30.340
Name, Kang Min Soo. Age 29.

53:30.340 --> 53:33.250
A top student from Poongsan University
studying mechanical engineering.

53:33.250 --> 53:38.410
He was a whiz with cars, and he would
fix up the cars at the station.

53:38.410 --> 53:42.890
But he was out today
without calling in.

53:42.890 --> 53:44.770
Okay.

53:50.340 --> 53:52.100
Ready!

54:05.690 --> 54:07.730
Fire shot!

54:08.490 --> 54:10.360
Fire shot!

54:10.960 --> 54:16.200
Captain Jang Kyung Hak of
the Golden Time Team leaves our side.

54:16.200 --> 54:23.410
He always sacrificed himself
to protect the civilians.

54:23.410 --> 54:27.730
Until the moment of his death,
he protected the lives of the public

54:27.730 --> 54:31.390
and fulfilled his duties completely
as a police officer.

54:31.390 --> 54:35.830
As fellow officers, we will make sure
his sacrifices were not made in vain.

54:35.830 --> 54:41.210
We will try our best
to build a safe society.

55:10.230 --> 55:12.680
Salute!

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
<i>[9:30 a.m.]</i>

55:30.000 --> 55:32.430
<i>[Thirty minutes before prior to
the murder attempt of rapist Yum Gi Tae]</i>

55:32.430 --> 55:33.780
Hello!

55:33.780 --> 55:37.760
<i>The child sex offender, Yum Gi Tae,
who shocked the nation six years ago</i>

55:37.760 --> 55:40.000
<i>was recently released.</i>

55:40.000 --> 55:45.160
<i>He was met with condemnation
when his hideous acts were revealed</i>

55:45.160 --> 55:48.720
<i>but he was only sentenced
to six years in jail.</i>

55:48.720 --> 55:53.600
<i>It's been confirmed that he has
settled in a specified area in Poongsan.</i>

55:53.600 --> 55:58.490
<i>The worries and complaints
of the underage victim's parents</i>

55:58.490 --> 56:00.660
<i>and the nearby residents are increasing.</i>

56:01.550 --> 56:04.600
Dad, look.

56:04.600 --> 56:08.910
- I drew it.
- I'm busy, get ready for school.

56:10.080 --> 56:15.290
Yeah, Ji Wook. Let me see.

56:15.290 --> 56:17.620
Wow, it's really good.

56:20.760 --> 56:23.660
It's really good.

56:23.660 --> 56:27.180
Are you ready to go to school?

56:27.180 --> 56:28.670
Let's go.

56:29.700 --> 56:32.290
Okay, let's go.

56:33.680 --> 56:35.390
Smile.

56:39.890 --> 56:42.060
- Hello.
- Sign this.

56:44.200 --> 56:46.700
- I signed this yesterday.
- Hee Joo didn't tell you?

56:46.700 --> 56:48.600
My husband was
going around getting signatures

56:48.600 --> 56:52.180
but he grabbed her shoulder
and she treated him like a pervert.

56:52.180 --> 56:55.400
She ripped the paper into pieces
while everyone was looking.

56:55.400 --> 56:57.670
That's why I need to go around again.
What's wrong with her?

56:57.670 --> 57:02.120
- Is she afraid of men or something?
- I'm sorry.

57:04.270 --> 57:07.790
I'm letting it go for your sake.

57:07.790 --> 57:10.010
Make sure you talk to her,
this isn't the first time.

57:10.010 --> 57:14.280
- How will she function in society?
- You're going too far.

57:14.280 --> 57:16.750
She's only a teen.

57:16.750 --> 57:18.490
He must have shocked her!

57:18.490 --> 57:23.580
What's wrong with you?
You only care about your daughter?

57:23.580 --> 57:27.640
- We'll take care of our child!
- What's wrong with you?

57:27.640 --> 57:31.830
I'm sorry, I apologize for him. Sorry.

57:31.830 --> 57:37.490
What the heck, she's the one who
was wrong, and I'm getting yelled at?

57:37.490 --> 57:41.820
- We'll talk about this again later.
- Sorry.

57:44.950 --> 57:46.920
What's wrong with you?

57:46.920 --> 57:50.800
We just moved here.
You want to move again?

57:50.800 --> 57:53.720
I'm upset, too, that the scumbag is out!

57:56.150 --> 57:59.180
My picture is ruined!

57:59.180 --> 58:03.790
- Ji Wook, why are you doing this, too?
- You always yell at me!

58:03.790 --> 58:05.620
Ji Wook!

58:07.970 --> 58:12.540
Please take good care of him.
Ji Wook, have a nice day.

58:20.240 --> 58:23.500
<i>Mom, save me.
Yum Gi Tae kidnapped me.</i>

58:29.430 --> 58:33.430
What's going on?

58:33.430 --> 58:36.600
She sent me a text
that she's been kidnapped

58:36.600 --> 58:40.240
but she's not picking up her phone.
Check where she is.

58:42.440 --> 58:46.530
Hwai-dong is where
that scumbag Yum Gi Tae lives.

58:46.530 --> 58:49.980
That bastard.

58:49.980 --> 58:53.340
Calm down, I'll call the police.

58:53.340 --> 58:56.710
- Calm down...
- I'll get there first.

58:57.540 --> 58:59.940
Bring the cops, too!

58:59.940 --> 59:01.950
Wait...

59:01.950 --> 59:03.250
That crazy bastard!

59:09.650 --> 59:14.440
- Crazy bastard!
- No, Honey...

59:18.960 --> 59:20.600
What's wrong?

59:21.570 --> 59:26.080
You're saying the pilot team operation
of the Golden Time Team starts today?

59:26.080 --> 59:31.480
Yeah, and Do Kang Woo
is the captain of the dispatch team.

59:31.480 --> 59:36.010
Is that center director protesting
because of their captain's death?

59:36.010 --> 59:41.480
I don't understand
why else they would do this.

59:42.750 --> 59:46.270
Sir, I'll do whatever it takes
to try to withhold them...

59:46.270 --> 59:50.290
Forget it, the headquarters
already approved it.

59:50.290 --> 59:53.350
What power do we have
to go against them?

59:56.340 --> 59:58.860
Hong Soo.

59:58.860 --> 01:00:00.600
You know, next month...

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:07.330
we'll be getting a medal for taking good
care of the Jang Soo Bok case, right?

01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:12.130
But if people start
talking about this case...

01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:14.600
I'll be in a very sticky situation.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.520
You understand what I'm saying, right?

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:25.420
Of course. Have I ever
disgraced our station?

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:29.050
Okay, good.

01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:35.060
Do Kang Woo, this jerk...

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:38.010
He used the center director to come back?

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:44.830
Chief.

01:00:44.830 --> 01:00:47.510
This is endless.

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:50.120
They're only staying for a month,
why are they making us do this?

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.030
Why are you cleaning this out for them?

01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:57.610
What's with him now?

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.870
Big news.

01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:05.000
The captain of Golden Time Dispatch Team
is Captain Do Kang Woo.

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.930
- You're not going to work?
- No...

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:10.510
- You seem happy.
- Let's get to work.

01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:14.520
Take a look around.

01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:21.590
Seongun is a big city, so I'm sure
there was a lot of big news there.

01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:27.570
But other than the few incidents caused
by tourists, Poongsan is a quiet town.

01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:32.220
So please rest here comfortably
for the next month.

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:35.570
Code zero cases can happen
at any time, at any place.

01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:37.950
You should watch what you say.

01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:42.140
My goodness, I'm just saying...

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:49.700
Hello, I'm Golden Time Team's
director, Kang Kwon Joo.

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:55.500
Always remember that a caller's life
depends on the three minutes we have.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:58.730
I look forward to working with you all.

01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:05.210
Let's get back to work, then.

01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:10.690
You saw Jaws at the beach?

01:02:10.690 --> 01:02:14.440
You think that makes sense?
Sounds like you drank a lot.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.560
You shouldn't swim after you drink.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.470
You're still fighting over
the home-run ball you got yesterday?

01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:23.620
Why don't you just settle it
with a round of rock, paper, scissors?

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:26.570
Can you please repeat yourself?

01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:30.990
Maybe it's Russian,
I don't understand.

01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:32.830
Russian? I don't speak it.

01:02:32.830 --> 01:02:35.690
Hold on, I'll get it.

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.290
Where are you from?

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:51.140
Sir, the passenger wants to
go to the beach.

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:55.080
Please take her to Nymph Rock.
Yes, thank you.

01:02:57.350 --> 01:02:58.960
She was from Ukraine.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:02.790
There was a miscommunication between
with the cab driver, I took care of it.

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:11.440
This must have been a warehouse.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.870
Even if it's only
a pilot team for a month...

01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:15.950
- Use that one, I'll use this.
- Sure.

01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:20.750
- The captain is out on the first day?
- Where's Do Kang Woo?

01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:26.380
Go figure. Of course he's not at work.

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:30.010
- What do you mean?
- I don't know how he convinced you all

01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:34.950
but he's not the type
to run around trying to save lives.

01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:37.760
- Call and find out where he is.
- Sure.

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.910
This place has gotten so luxurious.
It's nice and bright in here.

01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:44.890
Oh, his phone is turned off.

01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:46.550
Seriously...

01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:51.020
Director, Captain Do hasn't come in.

01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:54.390
Yes, this is the 911 call center.
Please try to calm down.

01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:57.310
Detective Park, Captain Do
hasn't come in to work, yet?

01:03:57.310 --> 01:04:01.500
Ma'am, please try to calm down.
Who is going to kill who?

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.340
My husband.

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.240
He left to kill that scumbag.

01:04:05.810 --> 01:04:09.040
So please hurry and come!

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.150
- Please...
- Director Kang!

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:13.860
The caller says her husband left
to go kill someone.

01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:15.580
Let me get the call,
and figure out the situation.

01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:17.800
Detective Park, please hold on.

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:21.400
Kang Kwon Joo at
Poongsan Golden Time Team.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:24.690
My daughter left this morning
to go to school.

01:04:24.690 --> 01:04:29.810
She texted me saying
that scumbag kidnapped her.

01:04:29.810 --> 01:04:35.300
We checked her location through an app,
and her cell phone was at his house...

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:40.020
And my husband took a knife
and ran to that scumbag's house.

01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:43.160
Scumbag? Can you please explain?

01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:50.660
The caller's name is Oh Soon Im. Age 45.

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:54.300
She runs a fish shop at Poongsan Fish
Market with her husband, Hwang Ki Hyuk.

01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:58.290
They have a daughter, Hee Joo, 18.
And a son, Ji Wook, 7.

01:04:58.290 --> 01:05:03.980
Director Kang,
Hee Joo's a victim of child rape.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.810
The offender was released a month ago.

01:05:07.810 --> 01:05:11.990
After passing the teacher exam,
he got drunk and raped the child.

01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:14.890
Being that it was his first offense,
and it was six years ago

01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:17.110
he must have gotten off easy.

01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:20.240
Your daughter is a victim of child rape,
registered for police protection.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.690
Is that right?

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.430
Where is she going with that leg?

01:05:28.790 --> 01:05:32.200
I'm sure they're hiding something.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:36.100
Yes, she is a victim of child rape.

01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:39.350
Oh my goodness, child rape?

01:05:39.350 --> 01:05:45.330
So please find our Hee Joo for us.
And please find my husband, too.

01:05:45.330 --> 01:05:48.590
Director, we've located
Hee Joo's last cell phone signal.

01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:53.100
4-45 Hope Villa in Hwai-dong,
near Yum Gi Tae's residence.

01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:54.850
The phone is turned off.

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:58.400
See where she went after leaving home,
and check the CCTV by Yum Gi Tae's home.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:01.290
And track his ankle bracelet
to see where he was this morning.

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:02.610
Yes, Ma'am.

01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:05.390
This is a code zero situation.

01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:07.840
<i>Caller's name is Oh Soo Nim. Age 45.</i>

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:10.530
Her daughter, Hwang Hee Joo,
was raped six years ago.

01:06:10.530 --> 01:06:14.080
Believing the offender kidnapped her,
she says her husband, Hwang Ki Hyuk

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.690
<i>went to the offender
Yum Gi Tae's home with a knife.</i>

01:06:16.690 --> 01:06:19.660
Hwang Hee Joo's phone was last located
near Yum Gi Tae's home

01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:21.380
so he may have done this for revenge.

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:25.320
<i>Detective Park, please go to
3-45 Hope Villa, Hwai Street, Hwadong-gu</i>

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.780
<i>Yum Gi Tae's residence.</i>

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:29.890
Detective Koo, please go to Gyeyoung
Station and the Poongsan Fish Market.

01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:31.510
Yes, we're heading over.

01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:34.570
In case of emergency, Hwai Station,
please have a backup team.

01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:38.480
All officers, please wear bulletproof
vests and gloves, and keep safe.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:40.750
Send an emergency medical team
to the scene, too.

01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:42.080
Yes.

01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:08.600
I need to go first!

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:10.090
- Be safe!
- Yeah!

- Similar build and age.</i>

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:35.109

I think he's the culprit.</i>

01:08:35.109 --> 01:08:36.609
