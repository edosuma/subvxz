AKU: Long ago, in a distant land,

00:04.506 --> 00:09.010
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
Master of darkness,

00:09.302 --> 00:12.764
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

00:13.014 --> 00:18.311
But a foolish Samurai warrior,
wielding a magic sword,

00:18.603 --> 00:21.356
stepped forth to oppose me.

00:22.315 --> 00:24.192
(SWORD CLASHING)

00:24.442 --> 00:26.528
Before the final blow was struck,

00:26.611 --> 00:31.074
I tore open a portal in time
and flung him into the future,

00:31.241 --> 00:33.535
where my evil is law.

00:34.160 --> 00:38.039
Now the fool seeks to return to the past,

00:38.289 --> 00:42.961
and undo the future that is Aku.

02:30.652 --> 02:31.653
Sweet thing,

02:32.779 --> 02:33.780
I miss her.

02:36.115 --> 02:37.325
I hate the rain.

02:37.700 --> 02:39.452
It makes me all sentimental.

02:42.163 --> 02:44.707
You're probably wondering
what an old robot like myself

02:44.791 --> 02:47.126
is doing having all these feelings.

02:48.586 --> 02:50.838
Well, I'll tell you.

02:51.506 --> 02:52.590
But we got to go back.

02:53.341 --> 02:55.051
Way back, to the beginning,

02:55.802 --> 02:57.178
Aku's beginning.

02:58.262 --> 03:01.349
Ages ago, Aku slowly rose to power,

03:01.432 --> 03:03.393
and enslaved the world.

03:05.395 --> 03:07.105
But it wasn't fast enough.

03:08.356 --> 03:09.357
He needed an army...

03:12.860 --> 03:14.028
A robot army.

03:19.617 --> 03:22.662

04:29.979 --> 04:32.857
But as time progressed,
the scientists got better...

04:33.900 --> 04:34.901
Much better.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.363
We were the X-models...

04:39.697 --> 04:41.741
Lean, mean, and all machine-

04:42.200 --> 04:43.201
Except me.

04:44.744 --> 04:47.246
(TIRES SCREECHING)

04:59.008 --> 05:00.343
See, one of the scientists

05:00.760 --> 05:04.305
installed an experimental
emotion chip inside of me.

05:05.890 --> 05:08.768
Why? He was funny that way.

05:08.851 --> 05:10.603
(CHUCKLING)

05:45.304 --> 05:48.724
Emotions are bad news
for somebody in my profession.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.244
I began to have feelings.

06:13.207 --> 06:15.918
I started to understand
right from wrong...

06:16.586 --> 06:19.797
And what I did was very wrong.

06:20.590 --> 06:22.133
(GUNSHOTS)

06:51.370 --> 06:52.496
I became the best.

06:54.624 --> 06:55.875
The emotions helped.

06:56.626 --> 06:59.795
In a bad scrape,
the other X-models couldn't care.

07:04.050 --> 07:05.092
I cared.

07:07.803 --> 07:10.598
I got angry. It wasn't pretty.

07:41.295 --> 07:45.424
But then, I met Lulu, sweet thing.

08:01.691 --> 08:02.692
I retired.

08:03.234 --> 08:04.777
The last X-model left.

08:06.737 --> 08:11.117
I was lucky, too, because those scientists
made a new breed of robots...

08:13.744 --> 08:15.871
Bugbots, or something like that.

08:18.374 --> 08:19.500
I didn't care, though.

08:20.126 --> 08:21.544
Me and Lulu had a good thing.

09:10.009 --> 09:12.762
Seems like Aku got himself
a little problem,

09:13.095 --> 09:15.097
a problem that won't go away,

09:16.390 --> 09:18.184

09:23.272 --> 09:24.857
I wanted nothing to do with it,
