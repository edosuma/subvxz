WEBVTT

00:08.468 --> 00:10.971
(lion roaring)

00:17.185 --> 00:20.814
(pleasant orchestral music)

01:42.812 --> 01:44.980
[Patou] Once upon a time,

01:44.981 --> 01:49.069
back before I knew how to tie
my shoes, the sun came up.

01:53.114 --> 01:55.407
Now, I know an everyday sunrise

01:55.408 --> 01:59.078
may not seem like such a
big deal to some folks.

01:59.079 --> 02:01.371
But, imagine for a moment,

02:01.372 --> 02:04.167
if instead of rising up like this,

02:05.960 --> 02:08.211
one morning where you lived,

02:08.213 --> 02:12.342
she took a look around and
decided to go back to sleep.

02:13.510 --> 02:15.386
It happened once to us.

02:16.304 --> 02:18.681
Let me tell you all about it.

02:25.146 --> 02:28.065
♫ Cock-a-doo

02:28.066 --> 02:30.317
♫ Hoo hoo hoo hoo

02:30.318 --> 02:32.195
♫ Whoa

02:33.404 --> 02:36.449
♫ Ohdeohdelayhee hee

02:37.742 --> 02:40.285
♫ Cock-a-doo, what a day

02:40.286 --> 02:41.912
♫ The sun is shining brightly

02:41.913 --> 02:44.123
♫ Cock-a-doo, sunny day

02:44.124 --> 02:46.125
♫ Down here on the farm

02:46.126 --> 02:48.127
♫ Cock-a-doo, stay away

02:48.128 --> 02:50.003
♫ You big ol' wet ol' rain cloud

02:50.004 --> 02:51.338
♫ Or I'll cry out loud

02:51.339 --> 02:54.801
♫ With this voice of mine

02:56.344 --> 02:58.720
[Patou] This was our
rooster, Chanticleer.

02:58.721 --> 03:02.099
And though it was true that
he like to horse around some,

03:02.100 --> 03:04.643
fact was, that boy could sing.

03:04.644 --> 03:05.477
♫ Sun do shine

03:05.478 --> 03:08.147
♫ Sun do shine, sun do shine, sun do shine

03:08.148 --> 03:10.315
♫ Well, my daddy taught me how to sing,

03:10.316 --> 03:12.776
♫ And that's why this
voice means everything

03:12.777 --> 03:14.194
♫ Sun do shine

03:14.195 --> 03:16.029
[Patou] We all had our jobs on the farm,

03:16.030 --> 03:19.158
and Chanticleer's was to wake up the sun.

03:19.159 --> 03:21.786
And when he crowed, up she came.

03:22.787 --> 03:24.496
♫ Let it shine, let it shine

03:24.497 --> 03:25.581
♫ Let it shine

03:25.582 --> 03:27.332
[Patou] Hey, look,
here's me tying my shoes.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.001
Hi, Patou, what you doin'?

03:29.002 --> 03:32.004
I'm trying to tie these doggone shoes.

03:32.005 --> 03:33.130
(laughs) Again?

03:33.131 --> 03:34.006
(chickens clucking)

03:34.007 --> 03:35.257
Well, hi ladies.

03:35.258 --> 03:37.135
Oh, he's so handsome.

03:38.261 --> 03:40.095
[Hen In Polka Dots] Sings like a dream.

03:40.096 --> 03:41.263
He's a dream.

03:41.264 --> 03:43.141
And he's single, too.

03:45.476 --> 03:47.644
[Patou] He maybe wasn't the
smartest bird that ever lived,

03:47.645 --> 03:51.356
but when he crowed, there was
plenty of peace and harmony.

03:51.357 --> 03:52.399
Hey!

03:52.400 --> 03:55.527
[Patou] Well, plenty of harmony, anyway.

03:55.528 --> 03:57.487
And lots of sunshine.

03:57.488 --> 03:59.031
♫ Well, my daddy taught me how to sing

03:59.032 --> 04:01.658
♫ And that's why this
voice means everything

04:01.659 --> 04:05.329
♫ Sun do shine, you
better shine, better shine

04:05.330 --> 04:08.165
♫ Well, the sun do shine, you better shine

04:08.166 --> 04:15.380
♫ You better shine

04:15.381 --> 04:19.510
♫ You better shine, sun, you better shine

04:24.265 --> 04:26.975
♫ Digidigidigidowdow

04:26.976 --> 04:29.187
(laughing)

04:31.231 --> 04:33.690
[Patou] There was no doubt about it.

04:33.691 --> 04:37.694
Old Chanticleer kept us
animals up and shining.

04:37.695 --> 04:39.238
[All] Good day, Mr. Chanticleer.

04:39.239 --> 04:41.657
[Patou] But all that
was about to change.

04:41.658 --> 04:45.077
One morning, before
Chanticleer was even awake.

04:45.078 --> 04:46.078
Hey, Chanticleer.

04:46.079 --> 04:47.996
[Patou] A stranger snuck onto our farm

04:47.997 --> 04:50.624
to stop Chanticleer from crowing.

04:50.625 --> 04:53.710
Of course, Chanticleer wouldn't
give up without a fight.

04:53.711 --> 04:55.420
But what he didn't know

04:55.421 --> 04:57.631
was that this stranger had been sent

04:57.632 --> 04:59.759
by the Grand Duke of Owls.

05:00.885 --> 05:01.844
Nasty fella.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.556
(grunting)

05:07.517 --> 05:11.270
The good news here was that
Chanticleer had won the fight.

05:11.271 --> 05:13.438
The bad news was, the Grand Duke's bully

05:13.439 --> 05:18.277
had done his dirty deed,
for in all the commotion

05:18.278 --> 05:21.239
Chanticleer had plum forgot to crow.

05:23.449 --> 05:27.077
And the sun was comin' up without him.

05:27.078 --> 05:28.954
(gasping)

05:28.955 --> 05:32.833
When Chanticleer saw
this, it broke his heart.

05:32.834 --> 05:36.963
He reckoned maybe his crow
never did raise the sun.

05:38.214 --> 05:41.883
Look, it's comin' up without him.

05:41.884 --> 05:43.260
You're a phony.

05:43.261 --> 05:45.220
He's a fake!

05:45.221 --> 05:47.180
Hey, everybody, cock-a-doodle-doo!

05:47.181 --> 05:48.682
(laughing)

05:48.683 --> 05:51.435
[Patou] The Grand Duke's
evil plan had worked.

05:51.436 --> 05:55.397
He had turned us against
our very best friend.

05:55.398 --> 05:58.942
And without a reason to
crow, poor Chanticleer

05:58.943 --> 06:03.363
left the farm to look
for work in the city.

06:03.364 --> 06:07.493
Then came the rain, and
our troubles with the Duke.

06:13.791 --> 06:15.250
[Edmond] Who's that, Mom?

06:15.251 --> 06:17.002
That's the Grand Duke.

06:17.003 --> 06:20.005
He's the one who's
causing all the trouble.

06:20.006 --> 06:21.798
He sent that mean old rooster

06:21.799 --> 06:24.426
to Chanticleer's farm to pick a fight.

06:24.427 --> 06:25.595
Hm, how come?

06:26.721 --> 06:29.931
Because he didn't like
Chanticleer doing all that crowing

06:29.932 --> 06:31.600
and bringing up the sun.

06:31.601 --> 06:32.477
How come?

06:33.561 --> 06:37.690
Well, like most owls, he
likes the darkness and the rain.

06:41.277 --> 06:42.694
I'm not afraid of the dark.

06:42.695 --> 06:44.863
(gasps)

06:44.864 --> 06:46.865
Oh, it's you.

06:46.866 --> 06:48.241
You scared me!

06:48.242 --> 06:50.202
Dory, we got big problems.

06:50.203 --> 06:51.495
Have you looked out there?

06:51.496 --> 06:52.412
If that rain doesn't stop,

06:52.413 --> 06:53.914
we're all gonna go
floatin' down the river.

06:53.915 --> 06:55.957
[Patou] This is my
favorite part of the story.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.334
His name is Edmond, of course

06:57.335 --> 07:00.087
he didn't look quite like
this when I first met him.

07:00.088 --> 07:03.423
Anyhow, we weren't the only
folks having our troubles.

07:03.424 --> 07:06.968
Poor Edmond's family was
having their share too.

07:06.969 --> 07:07.928
[Father] The river's widened too fast,

07:07.929 --> 07:09.638
we gotta reinforce the sandbags.

07:09.639 --> 07:10.764
[Mother] Oh, you think that'll work?

07:10.765 --> 07:12.057
[Father] We'll make it work.

07:12.058 --> 07:12.891
I'll get the boys.

07:12.892 --> 07:13.725
Me too!

07:13.726 --> 07:15.936
You stop right there.

07:15.937 --> 07:18.063
Aw Mom, I'm one of the boys.

07:18.064 --> 07:19.815
He meant the big boys.

07:19.816 --> 07:21.108
I'm big enough.

07:21.109 --> 07:22.984
Not yet you're not, darling.

07:22.985 --> 07:24.736
[Radio] The U.S. Weather
Bureau is expecting

07:24.737 --> 07:25.612
yet another--

07:25.613 --> 07:26.780
(static)

07:26.781 --> 07:30.075
Downpour in the areas worst
hit by this week's flooding.

07:30.076 --> 07:31.576
[Older Boy] Dad, Mom, come on,

07:31.577 --> 07:33.245
bring the stuff around to the front.

07:33.246 --> 07:34.371
[Radio] Governor Dale declared

07:34.372 --> 07:35.914
a state of national emergency--

07:35.915 --> 07:37.082
Come on, guys, move it.

07:37.083 --> 07:38.792
I need some help, we've
gotta get the animals inside.

07:38.793 --> 07:40.043
[Patou] So while Scott and Mark

07:40.044 --> 07:42.629
got to help protect the
house against the flood,

07:42.630 --> 07:44.297
poor Edmond was left behind where

07:44.298 --> 07:47.134
he'd be safe and out of trouble.

07:47.135 --> 07:49.386
It's my house too, I wanna help.

07:49.387 --> 07:52.431
Well then, pray for the rain
to stop, and that'll help.

07:52.432 --> 07:53.473
[Father] Dory, I can't
find the flashlight!

07:53.474 --> 07:54.724
Coming!

07:54.725 --> 07:56.268
Now you stay here where
it's safe, pumpkin.

07:56.269 --> 07:58.270
I'm gonna help your father
and I'll be right back.

07:58.271 --> 07:59.104
[Older Boy] Come on, dad.

07:59.105 --> 08:00.313
[Father] Great, let's go!

08:00.314 --> 08:01.189
Hey Dad, they said on the radio

08:01.190 --> 08:02.732
the National Guard might come.

08:02.733 --> 08:04.444
I am too a big boy.

08:11.075 --> 08:15.787
"And without a reason to crow,
Chanticleer left the farm.

08:15.788 --> 08:17.498
"Then came the rain."

08:19.584 --> 08:21.711
(thunder)

08:26.841 --> 08:27.800
Mom, here!

08:32.638 --> 08:34.222
How is she, Frank?

08:34.222 --> 08:38.018
Just start the truck, she'll be okay.

08:38.019 --> 08:38.811
Hey, hey!

08:40.270 --> 08:41.645
I know what we need here.

08:41.647 --> 08:43.690
We need Chanticleer.

08:43.691 --> 08:46.193
(thunder)

08:46.194 --> 08:48.778
(water rushing)

08:48.779 --> 08:49.779
(gasps)

08:49.780 --> 08:50.614
Mom!

08:50.615 --> 08:52.992
Boys, the levee's breaking!

08:54.702 --> 08:55.828
Chanticleer!

08:57.538 --> 08:58.498
Chanticleer!

08:59.749 --> 09:01.458
(explosion)

09:01.459 --> 09:04.544
[Patou] Edmond had the right
idea to call for Chanticleer,

09:04.545 --> 09:08.549
but he never coulda guessed
who was gonna answer.

09:18.976 --> 09:21.771
(heavy footsteps)

09:24.315 --> 09:25.941
Chanticleer?

09:25.942 --> 09:28.152
No, it's not Chanticleer.

09:30.613 --> 09:31.905
Who...

09:31.906 --> 09:33.365
Who are you?

09:33.366 --> 09:37.495
You put your finger in
the Duke's face, remember?

09:39.580 --> 09:41.707
These are expensive, brat!

09:43.125 --> 09:47.171
But that is not why the
Duke is going to eat you.

09:48.673 --> 09:49.965
Eat me?

09:49.966 --> 09:53.009
Oh dear, now I've gone
and spoiled the surprise.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.804
Oh, always doing that.

09:56.472 --> 09:59.849
But you see, we creatures of the night

09:59.850 --> 10:03.563
have worked very hard
to make absolutely sure

10:05.356 --> 10:07.900
that that bird does not return.

10:09.569 --> 10:13.698
You, you, with no regard
for the feelings of others,

10:15.116 --> 10:18.744
had the nerve to call
him back here by name!

10:20.871 --> 10:24.750
And besides, I positively
loathe rock and roll.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.338
(laughing maniacally)

10:30.339 --> 10:31.631
You're not gonna eat me!

10:31.632 --> 10:34.426
[Patou] And that's when
the Duke hit the ceiling.

10:34.427 --> 10:37.637
If Edmond wanted to bring
Chanticleer back to raise the sun,

10:37.638 --> 10:41.224
the Duke was gonna have
somethin' to say about it.

10:41.225 --> 10:43.686
Kittens are more digestible.

10:45.104 --> 10:46.479
[Patou] Young Edmond was about to have

10:46.480 --> 10:50.443
the most amazing adventure
he'd ever dreamed of.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.988
(yowling)

10:54.989 --> 10:57.575
(evil laughter)

11:12.798 --> 11:14.675
Mom, Dad, wake me up!

11:15.718 --> 11:17.719
[Patou] This is where I come in.

11:17.720 --> 11:18.553
(chomp)

11:18.554 --> 11:20.681
(yelling)

11:22.558 --> 11:25.018
You'll pay for this, Patou!

11:25.019 --> 11:26.436
This does not concern you.

11:26.437 --> 11:28.104
It does if it's about Chant--

11:28.105 --> 11:31.150
The light, the owls hate the light!

11:33.861 --> 11:36.489
(+screams)

11:38.949 --> 11:39.742
Whew.

11:40.910 --> 11:41.952
Hey, hey boy.

11:43.412 --> 11:44.955
We were this close.

11:46.207 --> 11:50.001
Oh, that flashlight biz was
quick thinking on your part.

11:50.002 --> 11:51.628
What's your name, little fella?

11:51.629 --> 11:53.213
Edmond.

11:53.214 --> 11:54.130
Is he gone?

11:54.131 --> 11:55.632
Yeah, he's gone, but he'll be back

11:55.633 --> 11:57.842
and he won't be alone, the coward.

11:57.843 --> 12:01.596
I woulda whopped him if
I'da had my shoes tied.

12:01.597 --> 12:03.598
But you know something, tying shoes

12:03.599 --> 12:05.934
is harder than dry dog food.

12:05.935 --> 12:07.936
Whatcha wearing shoes for?

12:07.937 --> 12:09.187
Bunions.

12:09.188 --> 12:13.317
I got a load of bunions,
and them shoes help my feet.

12:14.318 --> 12:17.070
Here, let me show you how to tie 'em.

12:17.071 --> 12:18.071
(gasps)

12:18.072 --> 12:19.949
Jeepers, I'm all furry!

12:20.825 --> 12:22.283
Well, kittens are furry.

12:22.284 --> 12:25.203
But, but, I'm a little boy.

12:25.204 --> 12:26.621
(yowling scream)

12:26.622 --> 12:27.747
(gulp)

12:27.748 --> 12:29.625
Did that come outta me?

12:30.960 --> 12:34.212
I'm, I'm a cat, he turned me into a cat!

12:34.213 --> 12:36.089
Help me, do something!

12:36.090 --> 12:38.591
I can't be a cat, I'm a boy!

12:38.592 --> 12:39.926
Patou, what'll I do?

12:39.927 --> 12:42.762
Alright, steady boy, keep your pants on.

12:42.763 --> 12:44.724
(gasps)

12:54.817 --> 12:55.900
Yuck!

12:55.901 --> 12:58.903
What am I doing, I'm licking myself.

12:58.904 --> 13:01.948
(sniffing)

13:01.949 --> 13:02.824
[Peepers] Patou!

13:02.825 --> 13:03.951
I'm in here.

13:06.662 --> 13:10.457
By my calculations, this
can't possibly be the city.

13:10.458 --> 13:12.752
Let's see. 367 southeast...

13:15.838 --> 13:16.881
Or is it 676?

13:18.507 --> 13:20.300
(gasps)

13:20.301 --> 13:21.926
(laughing)

13:21.927 --> 13:25.054
It's okay Peepers, it's Edmond.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.431
He's a nice kitty.

13:26.432 --> 13:27.640
I'm a boy!

13:27.641 --> 13:29.267
And I almost ate a mouse.

13:29.268 --> 13:30.685
I must be crazy.

13:30.686 --> 13:33.688
You bet your sweet whiskers.

13:33.689 --> 13:34.482
Wow.

13:36.275 --> 13:37.358
Ain't no city around here.

13:37.359 --> 13:38.486
Oh, sadness.

13:40.571 --> 13:43.156
Hey, aren't you gonna tie my shoes?

13:43.157 --> 13:45.950
I can't, I can't help anybody.

13:45.951 --> 13:47.161
I'm too little.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.331
I'm a scrawny furball runt.

13:51.665 --> 13:55.001
Mom and Dad won't even recognize me!

13:55.002 --> 13:56.212
Mom, Dad, help!

13:57.922 --> 14:00.049
(thunder)

14:03.344 --> 14:05.512
Oh, Chanticleer.

14:05.513 --> 14:06.346
What?

14:06.347 --> 14:08.348
If he doesn't come back and crow soon,

14:08.349 --> 14:12.143
it won't shine again and the
rain will keep coming down

14:12.144 --> 14:13.937
and the water will get higher and higher

14:13.938 --> 14:15.772
'til, 'til...

14:15.773 --> 14:16.816
We all drown.

14:19.068 --> 14:21.611
Wowie wow wow wow wow!

14:21.612 --> 14:23.154
Are we close, are we near the city?

14:23.155 --> 14:24.906
Us magpies are just made for the city.

14:24.907 --> 14:25.990
Come on already, hurry up, Peepers!

14:25.991 --> 14:28.284
We are not looking for the city.

14:28.285 --> 14:30.453
We are looking for Chanticleer.

14:30.454 --> 14:32.455
Well he's in the city, isn't he?

14:32.456 --> 14:33.790
Then he is in the city.

14:33.791 --> 14:35.375
Girls, they think they know everything.

14:35.376 --> 14:37.544
Why don't you run home, be
a mousewife, make cheese.

14:37.545 --> 14:40.338
Snipes, you think you're so superior.

14:40.339 --> 14:41.172
"Thuperior."

14:41.173 --> 14:42.006
Nice lisp.

14:42.007 --> 14:44.968
My lisp isolates and elevates me,

14:44.969 --> 14:47.095
and makes me a rare specimen.

14:47.096 --> 14:48.471
Ah, this is flippin' garbage!

14:48.472 --> 14:50.348
(arguing)

14:50.349 --> 14:51.850
Pipe down, you two.

14:51.851 --> 14:53.309
The story's true!

14:53.310 --> 14:55.854
You all laughed at him and he went away.

14:55.855 --> 14:57.146
You're right, son.

14:57.147 --> 15:00.984
We done wrong, and that's why
we're searchin' for the city.

15:00.985 --> 15:03.611
We gotta find Chanti and apologize.

15:03.612 --> 15:05.071
Then he'll forgive us...

15:05.072 --> 15:05.864
Come home...

15:05.865 --> 15:07.448
[Chicks] And raise the sun!

15:07.449 --> 15:09.701
Well, I know where the city is.

15:09.702 --> 15:11.786
I've been there lots of times as a boy.

15:11.787 --> 15:12.620
A boy?

15:12.621 --> 15:15.707
Before that big owl
turned me into a cat!

15:15.708 --> 15:16.541
Owl?

15:16.542 --> 15:17.876
(snorts) Owl?

15:17.877 --> 15:21.170
Edmond, would you take us to the city?

15:21.171 --> 15:21.964
I can't.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.300
Look at me, I'm a cat.

15:25.301 --> 15:27.010
No, a little kitty.

15:27.011 --> 15:28.137
What can I do?

15:30.222 --> 15:33.391
I can do lots of things, and
I'm a lot smaller than you.

15:33.392 --> 15:37.270
And furthermore, I could
forgive you for being a cat

15:37.271 --> 15:39.731
if you would take us to the city.

15:39.732 --> 15:41.149
Of course, if you're a fraidy-cat...

15:41.150 --> 15:42.692
I'm not afraid!

15:42.693 --> 15:44.694
Or like, a scaredy-cat...

15:44.695 --> 15:46.571
- Me, scared?
- Hey, guys...

15:46.572 --> 15:48.323
Lay off the boy.

15:48.324 --> 15:49.449
Hey, hey guys...

15:49.450 --> 15:50.408
Okay, okay!

15:50.409 --> 15:52.327
I'm not afraid of anything.

15:52.328 --> 15:55.914
I'll take you to the city
and find Chanticleer.

15:55.915 --> 15:57.832
(animals laughing)

15:57.833 --> 16:02.629
And bring him home, and save
Dad and Mom and the farm.

16:02.630 --> 16:05.965
Alright, hope you can swim, guys.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.343
[Edmond] Oh no!

16:09.511 --> 16:12.472
(coughing)

16:12.473 --> 16:14.724
We don't have to swim,

16:14.725 --> 16:16.060
we'll go by boat.

16:17.478 --> 16:19.979
Oh, this is serious.

16:19.980 --> 16:24.442
Peepers, you'll need
this if those owls return.

16:24.443 --> 16:25.652
Here!

16:25.653 --> 16:26.819
Owls?

16:26.820 --> 16:28.947
I'm sticking with you.

16:28.948 --> 16:30.573
Well fellas, this is it.

16:30.574 --> 16:31.616
(gulps)

16:31.617 --> 16:32.867
[Snipes] The city!

16:32.868 --> 16:34.577
The lights, the chicks, the food.

16:34.578 --> 16:37.122
Bye, good luck with the owls!

16:39.375 --> 16:40.583
Owls?

16:40.584 --> 16:42.795
(whimpers)

16:44.254 --> 16:45.797
(thunder)

16:45.798 --> 16:47.632
[Patou] Yep, owls.

16:47.633 --> 16:52.345
While Edmond set our course
for the city in the USS Toybox,

16:52.346 --> 16:55.223
the Duke and his owls
were back in their lair

16:55.224 --> 16:57.976
stirrin' up some powerful nasty weather.

16:57.977 --> 17:00.771
(low organ music)

17:11.073 --> 17:13.657
So he turns on the Duke, and with what

17:13.659 --> 17:16.577
do you suppose he turns on the Duke?

17:16.578 --> 17:17.869
[All] What, Master?

17:17.871 --> 17:19.414
A flashlight!

17:19.415 --> 17:20.748
♫ What a horrible thing to do

17:20.749 --> 17:22.375
♫ ♫ What a horrible thing to do

17:22.376 --> 17:24.627
♫ Thing to doooo

17:24.627 --> 17:27.130
But then, when my back is turned,

17:27.131 --> 17:29.298
what four-legged flea-bitten louse

17:29.299 --> 17:30.633
comes sneaking through the window

17:30.634 --> 17:33.177
and has the nerve to bite me on the leg?

17:33.178 --> 17:35.638
♫ Who, who, who, who, who?

17:35.639 --> 17:36.931
- Who?
- Patou.

17:36.932 --> 17:37.765
(gasps)

17:37.766 --> 17:38.599
Yes!

17:38.600 --> 17:41.769
♫ Patou, Patou

17:41.770 --> 17:43.896
Destroy the farm,
destroy the cat, the dog,

17:43.897 --> 17:45.273
or do you want the chicken back?

17:45.274 --> 17:46.315
♫ No, we hate the sun

17:46.316 --> 17:49.193
♫ The answer's noooo

17:49.194 --> 17:52.613
It'll make my leg feel so much better

17:52.614 --> 17:54.908
if that rooster never crows!

17:57.244 --> 18:01.080
(laughs maniacally)

18:01.081 --> 18:02.498
♫ We hate the sun

18:02.499 --> 18:03.374
♫ That much we know

18:03.375 --> 18:04.459
Rain!

18:04.460 --> 18:06.836
♫ We hate the rooster.
we'll never let it crow

18:06.837 --> 18:07.670
Never let him crow!

18:07.671 --> 18:09.047
♫ We hate the sun

18:09.048 --> 18:10.423
♫ From head to toe

18:10.424 --> 18:11.257
From head to toe!

18:11.258 --> 18:15.928
♫ We hate the rooster,
we'll never let it crow.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.891
♫ Never let it crow

18:22.770 --> 18:24.937
Never let it crow.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.149
(crashing)

18:28.150 --> 18:28.942
Aaahhh!

18:35.157 --> 18:36.407
Uncle Dukey, Uncle Dukey.

18:36.408 --> 18:38.785
(yells)

18:38.786 --> 18:40.453
I wish you wouldn't do that.

18:40.454 --> 18:43.916
Hunch, I told you never to call me that.

18:45.084 --> 18:46.209
Yes, sir.

18:46.210 --> 18:47.169
No sir, sir.

18:48.253 --> 18:49.629
But guess what I just saw,

18:49.630 --> 18:52.173
Patou the dog floating in
a toybox down the river,

18:52.174 --> 18:53.925
and he has this cute little
white kitty with him--

18:53.926 --> 18:55.886
(yells)

18:57.387 --> 19:00.015
Hunch, my little pygmy nephew.

19:03.852 --> 19:05.395
Come to your uncle.

19:07.606 --> 19:08.815
(jumbled organ notes)

19:08.816 --> 19:09.608
Ah!

19:12.820 --> 19:14.320
[Patou] Meanwhile, bound for the city,

19:14.321 --> 19:17.949
Edmond steered us through the
perils of the flooded river.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.826
[Peepers] Starboard ho!

19:19.827 --> 19:20.785
[Snipes] Starboard who?

19:20.786 --> 19:21.786
Left or right?

19:21.787 --> 19:23.704
[Edmond] Uh-oh.

19:23.705 --> 19:27.750
Giant tree, a hundred feet and closing!

19:27.751 --> 19:29.377
Jumpin' Jehosaphat!

19:29.378 --> 19:31.754
We need wind power!

19:31.755 --> 19:32.672
40 feet!

19:32.673 --> 19:35.216
Well guys, I-I think
I'm slowing you down.

19:35.217 --> 19:36.759
Yeah, I'll see you later, guys.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.302
30 feet!

19:38.303 --> 19:39.137
Ahh!

19:39.138 --> 19:41.682
Come on, Patou, pull on this.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.521
It worked!
- Turn now!

19:48.981 --> 19:51.275
(screaming)

19:52.609 --> 19:54.861
This is the right way, guys!

19:54.862 --> 19:58.991
(humming "Ride of the Valkyries")

20:02.661 --> 20:04.370
Okay guys, you heard the Duke.

20:04.371 --> 20:07.666
Total and complete, oh-ho, annihilation.

20:09.751 --> 20:10.627
Bombs away!

20:12.087 --> 20:12.880
Aah!

20:15.090 --> 20:16.132
Hey!

20:16.133 --> 20:18.177
Bombs away, bombs away!

20:19.595 --> 20:22.180
Edmond, grab ahold!

20:22.181 --> 20:23.639
Ooh ho ho, gotcha--

20:23.640 --> 20:24.433
Oow!

20:25.350 --> 20:26.643
Get my camera!

20:27.561 --> 20:28.394
Huh?

20:28.395 --> 20:30.354
What does he want with a camera?

20:30.355 --> 20:32.565
Get that camera.

20:32.566 --> 20:33.858
Ooh, I gotcha, kitty.

20:33.859 --> 20:34.985
Put me down!

20:36.570 --> 20:37.695
(growling)

20:37.696 --> 20:39.280
Say cheese!

20:39.281 --> 20:40.406
Oooh!

20:40.407 --> 20:42.450
Ha ha, we got 'em.

20:42.451 --> 20:43.327
Uh-oh...

20:46.663 --> 20:48.457
- Oh no!
- Get the lid.

20:52.669 --> 20:54.463
Ahah, adequate pipe.

20:59.968 --> 21:01.762
L-Let me outta here.

21:03.931 --> 21:05.264
I can't breathe!

21:05.265 --> 21:06.098
Help, I need air.

21:06.099 --> 21:06.933
What's wrong with him?

21:06.934 --> 21:08.392
He's claustrophobic.

21:08.393 --> 21:12.522
Teeny-weeny tight spaces
make him very, very nervous.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.067
Uh-oh.

21:16.068 --> 21:16.860
Uh-oh!

21:18.195 --> 21:20.489
Get him away from the lid.

21:22.991 --> 21:26.870
Help, we're trapped,
we're trapped like rats.

21:27.871 --> 21:29.622
We're trapped, we're
trapped, we're trapped.

21:29.623 --> 21:30.456
Trapped like rats...

21:30.457 --> 21:31.958
Come back here, you crazy bird.

21:31.959 --> 21:36.128
Now settle down, you're rockin' the boat.

21:36.129 --> 21:37.839
I can't breathe...

21:39.633 --> 21:42.844
Don't make me lose my temper, Snipes.

21:44.638 --> 21:47.432
I need air, I don't wanna swim.

21:48.475 --> 21:49.518
Mommy, we're trapped Mommy!

21:51.270 --> 21:52.396
Settle down.

21:53.438 --> 21:54.815
- Patou!
- Oh, no.

22:04.574 --> 22:05.367
Aah!

22:14.793 --> 22:17.004
(coughing)

22:18.338 --> 22:19.923
That was close.

22:22.968 --> 22:24.051
Mercy.

22:24.052 --> 22:24.845
Oh no!

22:27.973 --> 22:30.099
[Peepers] Abandon ship, abandon ship!

22:30.100 --> 22:32.394
(screaming)

22:35.856 --> 22:39.401
(coughing and spluttering)

22:41.903 --> 22:43.070
What's that smell?

22:43.071 --> 22:43.904
Garbage.

22:43.905 --> 22:44.989
Ah, this is pathetic.

22:44.990 --> 22:46.198
I risk my life and what do I get?

22:46.199 --> 22:47.033
Garbage!

22:47.034 --> 22:48.326
Why, I've never been so--

22:48.327 --> 22:49.119
Wow!

22:53.248 --> 22:54.124
The city!

22:55.208 --> 22:56.001
Wow!

22:59.463 --> 23:01.089
It's so beautiful.

23:02.841 --> 23:07.219
Now, all we got to
do is find Chanticleer

23:07.220 --> 23:11.350
and that's gonna be like hunting
for a needle in a haystack.

23:26.531 --> 23:28.658
(yawning)

23:35.248 --> 23:37.333
(clattering)

23:37.334 --> 23:38.126
Ow!

23:40.003 --> 23:41.587
Uncle Dukey, Uncle Dukey!

23:41.588 --> 23:42.381
I got 'em.

23:43.673 --> 23:48.386
If I killed my nephew, would
that be murder or charity?

23:48.387 --> 23:50.179
I got 'em, I really got 'em!

23:50.180 --> 23:51.680
No more kitty, sir.

23:51.681 --> 23:53.808
Mission, oohoh, accomplished.

23:53.809 --> 23:54.642
And the dog?

23:54.643 --> 23:56.520
Gone, wiped out, sir.

23:57.396 --> 24:01.482
Total and complete, ohoh, annihilation.

24:01.483 --> 24:02.651
Annihilation.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.071
How did you do it?

24:06.988 --> 24:08.406
Adequately.

24:08.407 --> 24:09.240
Ahe--

24:09.241 --> 24:10.783
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?

24:10.784 --> 24:14.370
Well, Uncle, we sucked
them into an adequate pipe.

24:14.371 --> 24:15.371
A what?

24:15.372 --> 24:16.622
That's what it said.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.583
"Danger, adequate pipe."

24:20.293 --> 24:21.169
Oh, dear.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.006
Come to Uncle.

24:26.466 --> 24:27.842
Aaah.

24:27.843 --> 24:29.385
You imbecile!

24:29.386 --> 24:33.515
That's not an adequate
pipe, it's an aqueduct pipe!

24:35.434 --> 24:37.309
It leads straight into the city!

24:37.310 --> 24:38.477
(gulps)

24:38.478 --> 24:41.940
The Duke gives you one last chance, Hunch.

24:43.358 --> 24:44.317
Them or you.

24:47.904 --> 24:49.196
Get to the city!

24:49.197 --> 24:50.197
Oh, not the city, sir.

24:50.198 --> 24:51.031
Oh no.

24:51.032 --> 24:52.741
It's too bright, I'll go blind.

24:52.742 --> 24:54.536
Oh, say it isn't so.

25:15.348 --> 25:18.601
Chamer, Chanta, Chantilly, Chantz.

25:18.602 --> 25:19.978
He's not in here.

25:23.857 --> 25:24.649
Let's go.

25:29.988 --> 25:31.489
[Patou] You ever get
that feeling when you're

25:31.490 --> 25:35.034
;lookin' for something that
it's right under your sniffer?

25:35.035 --> 25:38.329
I know it seems crazy,
but it was almost like

25:38.330 --> 25:41.458
we could hear his voice calling to us.

25:43.627 --> 25:45.044
You know, like he was just waiting

25:45.045 --> 25:47.755
for us to come and ask him back.

25:47.756 --> 25:52.176
But we looked everywhere,
and we talked with everyone,

25:52.177 --> 25:55.805
but nobody had heard
of Chanticleer, nobody.

25:57.641 --> 26:02.520
Funny thing was, he was right
under our nose the whole time.

26:02.521 --> 26:05.398
Or should I say, we were under his.

26:14.241 --> 26:16.992
No, Patou, that's not how it goes.

26:16.993 --> 26:20.455
For the hundredth time, it's over, around,

26:22.874 --> 26:27.003
under and through, that's
how Patou ties his shoe.

26:28.421 --> 26:29.589
Now you say it.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.884
(humming)

26:38.431 --> 26:40.141
Ooh, there you are!

26:41.476 --> 26:44.228
Pilot to bombardier, enemy target below!

26:44.229 --> 26:46.689
I'm going in for a closer look, cover me!

26:46.690 --> 26:49.734
(makes vroom noises)

26:51.695 --> 26:52.528
(gasps)

26:52.529 --> 26:53.822
What was that?

26:58.451 --> 27:00.579
(giggles)

27:01.496 --> 27:03.540
Complete attrocitation.

27:07.377 --> 27:10.170
Alright you guys, we've
left it long enough.

27:10.171 --> 27:12.756
They're counting on us back at the farm.

27:12.757 --> 27:14.091
Well, if you ask me--

27:14.092 --> 27:15.509
We didn't.

27:15.510 --> 27:17.553
Jumpin' Jehosaphat!

27:17.554 --> 27:18.387
What?

27:18.388 --> 27:19.763
It's him!

27:19.764 --> 27:20.598
[Snipes] Who?

27:20.599 --> 27:22.433
[Peepers] No wonder
we couldn't find him,

27:22.434 --> 27:24.310
he's changed his name.

27:24.311 --> 27:26.395
[Patou] Chanticleer is the King?

27:26.396 --> 27:27.354
[Edmond] The King?

27:27.355 --> 27:29.898
[Patou] Ooh, your Highness.

27:29.899 --> 27:33.652
[Announcer] Ladies
and gentlemen, the King!

27:33.653 --> 27:35.738
[Patou] Old Chanticleer
may have stopped crowin'

27:35.739 --> 27:38.532
but he hadn't stopped
using that voice of his.

27:38.533 --> 27:40.868
♫ Let me be your rooster

27:40.869 --> 27:42.703
♫ And let me roost with you

27:42.704 --> 27:44.163
(screaming)

27:44.164 --> 27:45.998
♫ Let me be your rooster

27:45.999 --> 27:49.585
♫ Let me hear your sweet voice coo

27:49.586 --> 27:53.005
♫ Girl, you've thrown me for a loop

27:53.006 --> 27:55.966
♫ You're the number one
chick in this chicken coop

27:55.967 --> 27:59.386
[Patou] Chanticleer had become a star.

27:59.387 --> 28:01.513
♫ I wanna rock, rock, rock
'til the day is through

28:01.514 --> 28:04.350
♫ I want to rock,
rock-a-doodle-doo tonight

28:04.351 --> 28:07.227
♫ I wanna rock, rock, rock
'til the morning light

28:07.228 --> 28:09.980
♫ Well it ain't right to rock alone

28:09.981 --> 28:12.941
♫ It takes two, I do believe

28:12.942 --> 28:15.235
♫ I'm gonna rock-a-doodle-doodle to you

28:15.236 --> 28:16.070
♫ To you

28:16.071 --> 28:18.864
♫ Like you rock-a-doodle-doodle to me

28:18.865 --> 28:20.824
♫ I'm gonna rock-a-doodle-doodle to you

28:20.825 --> 28:21.659
♫ To you

28:21.660 --> 28:23.702
♫ Like you rock-a-doodle-doodle to me

28:23.703 --> 28:24.745
♫ Rock-a-doodle-doodle

28:24.746 --> 28:26.997
[Patou] But not
everybody liked the King.

28:26.998 --> 28:28.832
Goldie here was jealous of him.

28:28.833 --> 28:31.418
Less my manager's fee of 60%.

28:31.419 --> 28:35.255
Look, Pinky, I just have to know when.

28:35.256 --> 28:39.134
Oooh, Goldie, will you not
bother me with this right now?

28:39.135 --> 28:41.261
You've gotta go on in two minutes.

28:41.262 --> 28:44.057
But I'm too good for the chorus.

28:45.308 --> 28:47.935
What's he got that I ain't got?

28:47.936 --> 28:49.061
A voice.

28:49.062 --> 28:51.605
♫ I wanna rock, rock-a-doodle
through the night

28:51.606 --> 28:55.192
♫ I wanna rock, rock, rock
'til the morning light

28:55.193 --> 28:57.236
[Patou] Fortunately
for us, Goldie was a lot

28:57.237 --> 29:00.906
smarter than she sounded,
and a lot nicer too.

29:00.907 --> 29:03.200
She just didn't know it yet.

29:03.201 --> 29:05.035
♫ Like you rock-a-doodle-doodle to me

29:05.036 --> 29:08.080
♫ Rock-a-doodle, rock-a-doodle,
rock-a-doodle-doo to me

29:08.081 --> 29:11.417
Lookie, Goldie, when I
found him, he was a nobody.

29:11.418 --> 29:14.044
Nobody wanted him, nobody cared about him,

29:14.045 --> 29:16.463
but I picked him up out of the gutter

29:16.464 --> 29:18.465
and now look at him.

29:18.466 --> 29:22.302
♫ Well it ain't right to rock alone

29:22.303 --> 29:24.847
Everybody starts in the chorus. Goldie.

29:24.848 --> 29:28.351
Of course, you could
give up show business.

29:29.394 --> 29:30.477
Pinky!

29:30.478 --> 29:33.063
♫ I wanna rock-a-doodle-doodle to you

29:33.064 --> 29:37.443
♫ Just like you rock-a-doodle-doodle to me

29:37.444 --> 29:39.486
Thank you, thank you very much.

29:39.487 --> 29:41.029
I love you, I love you.

29:41.030 --> 29:42.865
(audience cheering)

29:42.866 --> 29:44.283
[Edmond] Now that we found him,

29:44.284 --> 29:46.535
how do we get in to see him?

29:46.536 --> 29:47.703
[Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,

29:47.704 --> 29:50.622
the King is leaving the building.

29:50.623 --> 29:51.416
Ow!

29:52.625 --> 29:53.917
Out of the way!

29:53.918 --> 29:56.170
Move it, move it, move it!

29:56.171 --> 29:57.796
Don't touch the frogs.

29:57.797 --> 29:59.298
♫ Try it, you won't get very far

29:59.299 --> 30:01.216
♫ We'll bounce you once, bounce you twice

30:01.217 --> 30:03.135
♫ If you get out of
line, we're not very nice

30:03.136 --> 30:05.179
♫ We'll bounce, bounce
you all over the place

30:05.180 --> 30:09.433
♫ Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce,
if we don't like your face

30:09.434 --> 30:11.602
Get away from the star!

30:11.603 --> 30:13.979
[Patou] Chanticleer was a star alright,

30:13.980 --> 30:15.856
but it's hard to be happy without friends

30:15.857 --> 30:18.150
even if you are famous.

30:18.151 --> 30:20.944
I reckon he'd be awfully glad to see us,

30:20.945 --> 30:24.741
if we could just figure
a way to get near him.

30:26.034 --> 30:27.160
Aggravation.

30:31.956 --> 30:34.082
You were fantastic tonight, really!

30:34.083 --> 30:35.751
What can I get for ya, kid?

30:35.752 --> 30:37.294
You name it, anything

30:37.295 --> 30:38.837
You want a beach house in Maui?

30:38.838 --> 30:41.006
Ooh, I'll buy you the whole island.

30:41.007 --> 30:42.883
Cars, yachts, what?

30:42.884 --> 30:44.511
Name it, it's yours.

30:46.763 --> 30:47.596
Ah, thanks.

30:47.597 --> 30:49.973
Say, what's eatin' you?

30:49.974 --> 30:51.391
Well, I...

30:51.392 --> 30:53.101
Well, I just don't know.

30:53.102 --> 30:55.020
I guess I'm just a little
lonely, that's all.

30:55.021 --> 30:55.772
Lonely?

30:56.940 --> 30:58.816
Are you crazy?

30:58.817 --> 31:01.860
There's 20,000 people out
there screaming your name

31:01.861 --> 31:03.321
and you're lonely?

31:04.364 --> 31:05.614
(glass breaking)

31:05.615 --> 31:07.199
I love this guy.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.993
Yeah, but back on the farm...

31:09.994 --> 31:13.747
Hey, you told me yourself
what they did to ya on the farm.

31:13.748 --> 31:15.833
They don't love you.

31:15.834 --> 31:17.710
Murray, give us a roll.

31:19.087 --> 31:19.879
See that?

31:21.756 --> 31:23.216
They love you, eh?

31:29.347 --> 31:30.556
You were incredible.

31:30.557 --> 31:32.766
Mm-mm-mm, the King!

31:32.767 --> 31:34.894
Murray, get us outta here.

31:36.479 --> 31:37.855
Hello, Goldie?

31:37.856 --> 31:41.150
How'd you like to get out of the chorus?

31:42.360 --> 31:45.487
[Patou] Meanwhile, back on the farm...

31:45.488 --> 31:47.907
(whimpering)

31:50.243 --> 31:51.410
She's fading fast.

31:51.411 --> 31:52.995
How many more batteries have we got?

31:52.996 --> 31:54.329
Just these two.

31:54.330 --> 31:55.456
Oh, sadness.

31:56.416 --> 31:57.249
(phone ringing)

31:57.250 --> 31:59.377
(squeals)

32:01.212 --> 32:02.839
Whoa, sorry ma'am.

32:04.090 --> 32:04.965
Who is it, who is it?

32:04.966 --> 32:05.799
What do you want?

32:05.800 --> 32:06.633
We've got an emergency here.

32:06.634 --> 32:08.343
Yeah, yeah, Edmond?

32:08.344 --> 32:09.887
Anybody here named Edmond?

32:09.888 --> 32:11.346
I'm Edmond!

32:11.347 --> 32:12.431
The little boy who--

32:12.432 --> 32:13.765
I mean, the kitty.

32:13.766 --> 32:14.808
Who's this?

32:14.809 --> 32:17.060
Stuey, Stuey the pig.

32:17.061 --> 32:17.978
It's the kitty!

32:17.979 --> 32:20.606
Stuey, the light's going out.

32:20.607 --> 32:22.232
The lights are going out,
the lights are going out!

32:22.233 --> 32:24.109
Kitty, look, we're
running out of time here.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.652
We need Chanticleer, quick!

32:25.653 --> 32:27.738
We'll be there as soon as we can!

32:27.739 --> 32:29.072
Stuey!

32:29.073 --> 32:30.449
Yeah, yeah, I hear ya, I hear ya.

32:30.450 --> 32:31.783
Sorry kitty, gotta go, gotta go.

32:31.784 --> 32:33.285
(squeals) Good-bye.

32:33.286 --> 32:35.996
Stuey, what about my family?

32:35.997 --> 32:37.581
Are they alright?

32:37.582 --> 32:38.625
Soeey, Soeey?

32:40.501 --> 32:41.335
Stuey!

32:41.336 --> 32:43.630
(chuckling)

32:47.091 --> 32:48.301
Hello, kitty?

32:50.345 --> 32:52.054
It's the Duke.

32:52.055 --> 32:55.350
I have some rather bad news, I'm afraid.

32:57.685 --> 33:01.648
When the batteries expire,
so will your friends.

33:03.608 --> 33:05.902
Toodle-oo, cheerio, bye.

33:06.986 --> 33:07.945
[operator] The Number You Have dialed

33:07.946 --> 33:09.321

♫ Twiddley-dee

33:16.955 --> 33:19.289

33:47.902 --> 33:50.320
Oh howdy, boss, how are you?

33:50.321 --> 33:51.280
Uh-huh, huh?

33:52.865 --> 33:56.577
Did you say a cat, a
dog, a bird and a mouse?

33:57.495 --> 33:58.787
What is this?

33:58.788 --> 34:00.706
(laughs)

34:00.707 --> 34:02.332
Some kinda joke, huh?

34:02.333 --> 34:04.918
Well I don't think it's funny, Pinky.

34:04.919 --> 34:09.422
They want to bring
Chanticleer back to the farm.

34:09.424 --> 34:12.259
You don't want that, he
makes you lots of money.

34:12.260 --> 34:14.886
I don't want that, he makes me miserable.

34:14.887 --> 34:18.639
[Pinky] Right boss,
what should I do about it?

34:18.641 --> 34:22.770
Your chicken thinks they
don't want him on the farm.

34:23.855 --> 34:25.230
That's good.

34:25.231 --> 34:29.360
All you have to do is make
sure he keeps thinking that.

34:30.652 --> 34:33.739
It's not good that the
kitty and his friends

34:33.739 --> 34:36.701
should talk to your chicken, capice?

34:38.453 --> 34:40.454
Yeah, thanks a million.

34:40.455 --> 34:43.081
This has been most enlightening.

34:58.723 --> 35:00.182
Penguin suits, two for a dollar.

35:00.183 --> 35:02.601
You wanna see the King, come
and get your penguin suits.

35:02.602 --> 35:05.980
Remember, no dogs, cats, birds or meeses.

Excuse me, sir, would you please

35:39.180 --> 35:40.931
see that the King gets this?

35:40.932 --> 35:42.891
Yeah, it's really important.

35:42.892 --> 35:44.017
Oh, and waiter?

35:44.018 --> 35:48.230
We asked for light cola,
this stuff weighs a ton!

35:48.231 --> 35:49.773
Hmm.

35:49.774 --> 35:51.067
Get me the boss.

35:52.235 --> 35:54.112
It sounds bad, Pinky.

35:55.071 --> 35:58.990
It's only a little bad, not a big bad.

35:58.991 --> 36:02.494
Look, he's lonely, he needs a friend.

36:02.495 --> 36:05.872
And that bad little kitty
wants to steal him away.

36:05.873 --> 36:08.084
You don't want that, do ya?

36:09.210 --> 36:10.418
[Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,

36:10.419 --> 36:13.798
Pinky's Palace proudly presents the King!

36:18.719 --> 36:21.721
Thank you, thank you very much.

36:21.722 --> 36:24.683
(cheering)

36:24.684 --> 36:27.227
[Patou] Would you look at that.

36:27.228 --> 36:28.395
Chanticleer?

36:28.396 --> 36:30.272
♫ Well down in Tupelo

36:30.273 --> 36:32.107
♫ I was so alone

36:32.108 --> 36:35.277
♫ I never had no money to
have no honey for my own

36:35.278 --> 36:37.612
♫ That's why I'm treasure hunting

36:37.613 --> 36:38.446
♫ Whaa-Oo

36:38.447 --> 36:40.240
♫ Treasure hunting for my love

36:40.241 --> 36:43.243
♫ He's treasure hunting for his love

36:43.244 --> 36:47.038
♫ Well I've been everywhere,
searching high and low

36:47.039 --> 36:50.333
♫ But I ain't found no rainbow
yet that had a pot of gold

36:50.334 --> 36:52.502
♫ Well, I'm treasure hunting

36:52.503 --> 36:54.546
You know, I think he died of fear.

36:54.547 --> 36:56.423
Hey, what are you doing little fella?

36:56.424 --> 36:58.091
Something I learned in school.

36:58.092 --> 36:59.259
Cats don't go to school.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.969
But boys do.

37:00.970 --> 37:01.803
Hey!

37:01.804 --> 37:04.181
You boys is dead meat.

37:04.182 --> 37:05.891
Chanticleer!

37:05.892 --> 37:09.477
♫ Good King Neptune said
he'd help me find my treasure

37:09.478 --> 37:13.273
♫ Far below the sea

37:13.274 --> 37:17.403
♫ He introduced me to
every single purty mermaid

37:18.321 --> 37:19.821
Patou!

37:19.822 --> 37:21.281
♫ So I keep treasure hunting

37:21.282 --> 37:22.616
Do you promise no one gets hurt?

37:22.617 --> 37:24.868
No one gets hurt.

37:24.869 --> 37:27.621
You just do the number, make him happy

37:27.622 --> 37:30.457
and keep him away from
that bad little kitty!

37:30.458 --> 37:32.375
♫ Treasure hunting for my love

37:32.376 --> 37:36.296
♫ He's treasure hunting for his love

37:36.297 --> 37:39.507
Hey, there's no lobsters in this number.

37:39.508 --> 37:41.135
Get them outta here!

37:42.136 --> 37:44.804
Wait a minute, don't spoil the show, huh?

37:44.805 --> 37:46.640
♫ That treasure's all I'm thinking of

37:46.641 --> 37:49.309
♫ Thinking of, thinking of, thinking of

37:49.310 --> 37:51.728
♫ Well I got treasure hunting fever

38:00.363 --> 38:04.366
♫ Well I got treasure hunting fever

38:04.367 --> 38:05.659
♫ For love

38:05.660 --> 38:07.911
♫ Treasure hunting fever

38:07.912 --> 38:11.748
♫ Yeah I got treasure hunting fever

38:11.749 --> 38:12.749
♫ For love

38:12.750 --> 38:14.626
(applause)

38:14.627 --> 38:15.419
Now.

38:28.015 --> 38:32.852
♫ Deep deep, the trouble you're in

38:32.853 --> 38:36.983
♫ I've thrown you to the
sharks and you can't swim

38:40.278 --> 38:41.070
Oh no.

38:54.375 --> 38:57.252
Well, you can take the
rooster out of the country

38:57.253 --> 39:00.505
but you can't take the
country out of the rooster.

39:00.506 --> 39:02.841
Old Chanticleer had found
himself a city perch

39:02.842 --> 39:07.095
sorta tailored to remind him
of the farm he'd left behind.

39:07.096 --> 39:09.889
Trouble was, with Goldie on the scene

39:09.890 --> 39:13.685
he wasn't feelin' so
lonesome for us anymore,

39:13.686 --> 39:16.980
which was exactly the way Pinky wanted it.

39:16.981 --> 39:21.110
'Cause that was exactly the
way the Grand Duke wanted it.

39:23.321 --> 39:26.948
There was just one problem
with their plan, of course.

39:26.949 --> 39:29.784
Goldie was only supposed to pretend

39:29.785 --> 39:32.787
to fall in love with Chanticleer,

39:32.788 --> 39:35.750
but she was falling in love for real

39:37.710 --> 39:40.838
and that can really change a pheasant.

39:42.882 --> 39:46.927
♫ Love has said hello, you don't know

39:49.388 --> 39:53.517
♫ What that means, really means to me

39:55.102 --> 39:57.730
Ooooh, I think we've lost him.

39:58.606 --> 39:59.814
What do you mean?

39:59.815 --> 40:01.149
He's right there.

40:01.150 --> 40:03.234
Oh, no, no he ain't.

40:03.235 --> 40:05.320
He's a thousand miles away.

40:05.321 --> 40:06.154
Huh?

40:06.155 --> 40:08.448
(sighs)

40:08.449 --> 40:10.076
Isn't it romantic?

40:11.160 --> 40:15.206
When roosters fall in
love, they lose all reason.

40:16.248 --> 40:18.750
Aaah, enough mush, let's go eat.

40:18.751 --> 40:19.667
Eat?

40:19.668 --> 40:22.170
How can you think of
food at a time like this?

40:22.171 --> 40:23.338
Lasagna!

40:23.339 --> 40:24.298
Mm-mm-mm-mm.

40:25.424 --> 40:27.635
Chanticleer, Chanticleer!

40:30.054 --> 40:33.181
Oh Goldie, when I left the farm,

40:33.182 --> 40:35.517
I had such a big hole in my heart.

40:35.518 --> 40:38.019
You coulda put a John Deere
tractor through there.

40:38.020 --> 40:40.146
Oh, you poor thing.

40:40.147 --> 40:41.856
My heart is so full I could,

40:41.857 --> 40:44.859
I could just explode like a bloated lamb.

40:44.860 --> 40:47.905
Oh King, you say the nicest things.

40:49.115 --> 40:50.865
[Edmond] Chanticleer!

40:50.866 --> 40:54.495
♫ This song is our treasure

40:55.496 --> 40:59.625
♫ that we'll share our whole life through

41:00.543 --> 41:02.001
Chanticleer!

41:02.002 --> 41:05.422
I'm Sorry, Little Buddy,
but We're just no match

41:05.423 --> 41:07.549
for that painted feather duster.

41:07.550 --> 41:08.675
Oh yeah?

41:08.676 --> 41:10.802
Uh, hey, where you goin'?

41:10.803 --> 41:13.972
Well if I can't talk
to him, I'll talk to her.

41:13.973 --> 41:17.600
♫ As I kiss and coo

41:17.601 --> 41:21.397
♫ Kiss, kiss and coo with you

41:34.118 --> 41:38.663
[Newsboy] Read all about it,
mysterious rains spreading!

41:38.664 --> 41:40.958
Sun don't shine for farmers!

41:49.925 --> 41:54.054
"Goldie Pheasant to co-star
in King's new picture."

41:56.390 --> 42:00.143
You know, I think I'm too
little to get over those gates.

42:00.144 --> 42:01.437
Well, I'm not.

42:03.898 --> 42:07.859
[Patou] Hey, I think that's
her trailer over there.

42:07.860 --> 42:09.945
(humming)

42:17.828 --> 42:18.995
(clears throat)

42:18.996 --> 42:19.829
Excuse me, ma'am?

42:19.830 --> 42:21.080
(gasps)

42:21.081 --> 42:22.541
Oh, who are you?

42:24.001 --> 42:25.960
Ma'am, I, I--

42:25.961 --> 42:26.794
(sneezes)

42:26.795 --> 42:28.338
Oh my goodness.

42:28.339 --> 42:31.216
(sneezing continues)

42:31.217 --> 42:33.134
Oh, you poor thing!

42:33.135 --> 42:37.264
There, now what are you
doing in my dressing room?

42:40.142 --> 42:42.685
Please ma'am, you're the
only one who can help us.

42:42.686 --> 42:44.687
We have to talk to Chanticleer.

42:44.688 --> 42:45.980
I mean, the King.

42:45.981 --> 42:47.357
There's a terrible flood, and

42:47.358 --> 42:48.858
if he doesn't come home and crow...

42:48.859 --> 42:51.528
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

42:51.529 --> 42:55.782
You're the bad little
kitty Pinky told me about.

42:55.783 --> 42:56.741
Bad, me?

42:56.742 --> 42:57.701
I'm not bad.

42:59.370 --> 43:01.747
You go away or I'll scream!

43:03.040 --> 43:04.040
(screams)

43:04.041 --> 43:06.669
Please, if you'd just listen--

43:08.087 --> 43:10.381
(screaming)

43:16.512 --> 43:17.762
What happened?

43:17.763 --> 43:19.514
Ah, she's a woman.

43:19.515 --> 43:20.307
W-what?

43:23.352 --> 43:26.354
That's the last straw, I've had it!

43:26.355 --> 43:28.398
I wasn't talking to you--

43:28.399 --> 43:30.024
Aah!

43:30.025 --> 43:33.111
(Pinky laughing)

43:33.112 --> 43:34.737
Well, well, well.

43:34.738 --> 43:38.117
The dog, the cat, the bird and the mouse.

43:39.034 --> 43:41.327
We meet at last, eh?

43:41.328 --> 43:42.662
(laughing)

43:42.663 --> 43:43.622
Let us go!

43:44.957 --> 43:47.750
Max, take 'em to my
trailer, lock 'em up.

43:47.751 --> 43:51.630
Make sure the King doesn't
get a whiff of this.

43:52.798 --> 43:54.925
Oh no, what have I done?

43:56.010 --> 43:58.220
(laughing)

44:01.932 --> 44:04.643
No dogs, cats, boids or meeses.

44:05.561 --> 44:06.353
Ahah!

44:08.897 --> 44:11.649
[Patou] Now I gotta admit,
as bad guys go, the Duke's

44:11.650 --> 44:15.779
nephew Hunch was more a
hoot than he was horrible.

44:18.282 --> 44:20.450
(gurgling) Oh, boy.

44:20.451 --> 44:22.285
[Patou] But still, he was a nuisance

44:22.286 --> 44:24.203
and as we were tied up at the moment,

44:24.204 --> 44:27.249
we weren't all that happy to see him.

44:28.417 --> 44:29.209
Ahah!

44:36.800 --> 44:40.178
♫ I will always think of you

44:40.179 --> 44:43.765
♫ Ma, I miss your apple pie

44:43.766 --> 44:46.809
♫ Ma, I miss your stew

44:46.810 --> 44:50.856
♫ But most of all Ma, I miss you

44:53.651 --> 44:56.278
Look at that, ooh, anticipation!

44:57.863 --> 44:58.656
Ow!

45:03.494 --> 45:04.286
Ah, oh!

45:12.252 --> 45:14.463
(crashing)

45:20.969 --> 45:23.763
♫ Let's get away, you and me together

45:23.764 --> 45:25.473
♫ Two birds of a feather flying--

45:25.474 --> 45:27.434
[Pinky] Cut, cut, cut!

45:28.352 --> 45:31.312
Murray, what's with the snow here?

45:31.313 --> 45:32.689
Take five, everybody.

45:32.690 --> 45:35.983
And Miss Pheasant, how 'bout a smile, hmm?

45:35.984 --> 45:37.985
Oh, it's supposed to be
summer, for cryin' out loud!

45:37.986 --> 45:39.696
King, may I talk to you?

45:39.697 --> 45:42.115
Ah honey, don't pay no mind.

45:42.116 --> 45:43.533
You're gonna do just fine.

45:43.534 --> 45:44.367
Yeah, but--

45:44.368 --> 45:45.910
Now, now, no buts about it, honey.

45:45.911 --> 45:48.706
King, I've done something awful.

45:49.832 --> 45:51.375
What is it, baby?

45:53.419 --> 45:55.295
Patou, Snipes, Peepers.

45:56.547 --> 45:57.839
Goldie, where'd you get this?

45:57.840 --> 46:00.758
From you, that night we first met.

46:00.759 --> 46:02.552
They were here?

46:02.553 --> 46:04.263
They're still here.

46:07.224 --> 46:09.268
Why didn't you tell me?

46:10.728 --> 46:12.687
'Cause she wasn't supposed to!

46:12.688 --> 46:14.397
(gasps)

46:14.398 --> 46:16.942
Goldie, I'm disappointed in ya.

46:18.110 --> 46:22.321
I said to entertain
him, not to educate him.

46:22.322 --> 46:24.073
Entertain me?

46:24.074 --> 46:25.241
What's this all about?

46:25.242 --> 46:27.660
Calm down, kid, your
friends are just fine.

46:27.661 --> 46:28.786
No they're not, King.

46:28.787 --> 46:30.621
He's got them tied up in his--

46:30.622 --> 46:31.914
Shut up!

46:31.915 --> 46:32.708
What?

46:36.754 --> 46:38.337
Where are they?

46:38.338 --> 46:40.381
What have you done with 'em?

46:40.382 --> 46:43.092
Don't hurt him boys,
he's got a movie to make.

46:43.093 --> 46:44.635
I ain't making nothin' with you.

46:44.636 --> 46:48.681
Oh but King, I got a lotta
money tied up in this picture.

46:48.682 --> 46:50.683
I don't wanna lose my money,

46:50.684 --> 46:53.060
and you don't wanna lose your friends.

46:53.061 --> 46:54.103
That's blackmail!

46:54.104 --> 46:55.938
That's showbiz!

46:55.939 --> 46:56.732
Make-up!

46:57.858 --> 46:59.568
Here, kitty, kitty.

47:01.737 --> 47:03.447
Ohhoho, acceleration!

47:06.909 --> 47:07.701
Ow!

47:10.954 --> 47:13.332
(TV playing)

47:32.768 --> 47:33.560
Aah!

47:38.732 --> 47:39.565
Stand by

47:39.566 --> 47:40.399
Stand by!

47:40.400 --> 47:41.275
Quiet on the set.

47:41.276 --> 47:42.109
Quiet on the set!

47:42.110 --> 47:43.611
Hey, shut up.

47:43.612 --> 47:44.946
King, I'm sorry.

47:44.947 --> 47:46.280
Don't talk to me, I'm thinkin'.

47:46.281 --> 47:47.657
Roll sound.

47:47.658 --> 47:49.158
Speed.

47:49.159 --> 47:49.992
Where are they?

47:49.993 --> 47:52.078
They're in Pinky's trailer outside.

47:52.079 --> 47:52.871
Mark it.

47:53.831 --> 47:55.289
42A, take two.

47:55.290 --> 47:57.251
(clack)

47:58.710 --> 47:59.503
Oh yeah!

48:01.171 --> 48:02.964
Hang on, honey.

48:02.965 --> 48:05.676
(engine revving)

48:07.886 --> 48:09.930
That's not in the script.

48:11.181 --> 48:13.349
Stop those birds!

48:13.350 --> 48:14.476
Get them back!

48:16.937 --> 48:18.522
Look, there it is!

48:20.732 --> 48:23.985
Hoohoho, annihilation, abominations.

48:23.986 --> 48:25.195
Hold still, ow.

48:27.614 --> 48:29.908
(screaming)

48:31.410 --> 48:32.827
Watch out, King!

48:32.828 --> 48:33.620
Whoa!

48:41.211 --> 48:43.589
Oh no, no, I've killed him.

48:44.464 --> 48:46.090
Chanticleer!

48:46.091 --> 48:47.134
Hi, fellas.

48:48.302 --> 48:50.511
He's dead, he's dead,
he's dead, he's dead!

48:50.512 --> 48:53.556
Hey fellas, I'm sorry about this.

48:53.557 --> 48:55.766
Jumpin' Jehosaphat!

48:55.767 --> 48:57.895
He's not dead, untie me!

48:59.271 --> 49:01.439
(engines roaring)

49:01.440 --> 49:02.273
Oh no!

49:02.274 --> 49:05.276
Let's get him out of here.

49:05.277 --> 49:06.403
Who's there?

49:22.628 --> 49:24.838
Oh no, not Pinky's Caddy.

49:30.010 --> 49:31.594
Can you drive a car?

49:31.595 --> 49:32.720
Piece of cake.

49:32.721 --> 49:34.472
Edmond, you steer.

49:34.473 --> 49:35.306
Steer?

49:35.307 --> 49:37.350
I can't, I've never driven a car,

49:37.351 --> 49:38.517
Edmond, do it.

49:38.518 --> 49:39.352
We'll crash.

49:39.353 --> 49:41.730
Don't be such a fraidy-cat!

49:44.900 --> 49:45.692
Hey!

49:54.701 --> 49:55.494
Whoa!

50:12.135 --> 50:14.220
Edmond, open your eyes!

50:14.221 --> 50:15.347
Uh-oh, look!

50:18.225 --> 50:19.642
Abomination!

50:19.643 --> 50:20.435
Oww!

50:22.187 --> 50:24.814
Come on, Edmond, we
gotta lose that trailer.

50:24.815 --> 50:25.648
How?

50:25.649 --> 50:27.692
Edmond, cats are climbers.

50:27.693 --> 50:28.943
I'm a boy!

50:28.944 --> 50:29.986
Just climb down there--

50:29.987 --> 50:31.570
What? I can't.

50:31.571 --> 50:33.030
Don't be such a sissy!

50:33.031 --> 50:33.864
I'll fall!

50:33.865 --> 50:35.741
You're a cat, you won't fall!

50:35.742 --> 50:36.575
I will!

50:36.576 --> 50:38.202
Oh, I'll do it myself.

50:38.203 --> 50:40.330
You're such a scaredy-cat.

50:49.131 --> 50:51.258
(screams)

50:52.968 --> 50:53.760
Edmond!

50:55.345 --> 50:56.471
Patou, help!

51:00.100 --> 51:00.892
Hold on!

51:05.105 --> 51:06.397
(screams)

51:06.398 --> 51:07.190
Help!

51:09.860 --> 51:10.652
Peepers!

51:13.405 --> 51:15.406
Don't be a fraidy-cat.

51:15.407 --> 51:16.449
Fraidy-cat...

51:16.450 --> 51:17.700
I'm not afraid of anything.

51:17.701 --> 51:20.746
(voices overlapping)

51:26.084 --> 51:26.877
No!

51:27.836 --> 51:28.628
Stop!

51:36.011 --> 51:39.388
Guys, we're gonna go back and get her!

51:39.389 --> 51:42.017
(tires screech)

51:44.186 --> 51:45.561
(horn honking)

51:45.562 --> 51:48.189
Oh sure, they wanna play chicken, eh?

51:48.190 --> 51:49.774
Don't worry, boss, I ain't turnin'.

51:49.775 --> 51:51.610
Idiot, that's my car!

51:55.197 --> 51:55.989
Whoa!

51:57.449 --> 51:59.076
Snipes, the brake!

52:04.247 --> 52:06.499
I think she landed up here.

52:06.500 --> 52:07.292
Peepers!

52:08.919 --> 52:11.129
Come on, we gotta find her!

52:17.719 --> 52:19.303
Ooh, my baby!

52:19.304 --> 52:20.764
My beautiful baby.

52:21.807 --> 52:23.349
What are you lookin' at?

52:23.350 --> 52:24.600
Get up there!

52:24.601 --> 52:25.352
Peepers!

52:29.106 --> 52:30.649
Oh King, wake up.

52:31.525 --> 52:32.567
Oh, my shoes!

52:35.362 --> 52:38.197
(grunting)

52:38.198 --> 52:38.990
Bozo!

52:40.158 --> 52:41.450
Snipes!

52:41.451 --> 52:43.994
We're trapped, we're
trapped, we're trapped.

52:43.995 --> 52:45.913
Don't look down!

52:45.914 --> 52:48.625
(metal creaking)

52:51.086 --> 52:53.796
This is it, fellas, we're goin' down.

52:53.797 --> 52:55.632
Snipes, do something!

53:01.388 --> 53:02.597
Don't let go!

53:03.557 --> 53:05.851
(screaming)

53:11.565 --> 53:12.858
What a catch!

53:14.109 --> 53:15.818
Bring 'em in, Murray.

53:15.819 --> 53:16.611
Murray?

53:17.863 --> 53:19.071
Murray, who's Murray?

53:19.072 --> 53:19.905
Peepers!

53:19.906 --> 53:20.739
Edmond!

53:20.740 --> 53:23.701
Let's have some help up
here, this is the Quirky X62

53:23.702 --> 53:26.079
and these things are craaazy!

53:27.747 --> 53:30.792
The King, he's gone and I'm ruined!

53:39.718 --> 53:41.260
Oh no no no!

53:41.261 --> 53:42.888
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

53:44.848 --> 53:48.767
Gentlemen, go down and
invite our friends to dinner.

53:48.768 --> 53:50.061
Hoo, hoo, hoo!

53:51.104 --> 53:53.522
♫ We are the creatures of the night

53:53.523 --> 53:55.691
♫ And we invite you all for dinner

53:55.692 --> 53:57.902
♫ There's plenty of food to go around

53:57.903 --> 54:00.738
♫ When the food is you

54:00.739 --> 54:01.614
Who, me?

54:01.615 --> 54:02.615
♫ Yes, you

54:02.616 --> 54:05.034
♫ We thought a picnic would be nice

54:05.035 --> 54:07.703
♫ And we're so pleased
that you could join us

54:07.704 --> 54:09.788
♫ We're glad you're home, trick or treat

54:09.789 --> 54:10.998
♫ Fa la la la la la

54:10.999 --> 54:12.041
♫ How sweet

54:12.042 --> 54:15.127
♫ Now's the time, say your prayers

54:15.128 --> 54:15.961
♫ Time's up

54:15.962 --> 54:17.755
♫ Fa la la la la la, how sweet

54:17.756 --> 54:21.008
♫ Fa la la la la, let's eat

54:21.009 --> 54:22.969
Please, pass the pork.

54:29.517 --> 54:30.559
(laughing)

54:30.560 --> 54:33.229
Excellent, gentlemen, excellent.

54:33.230 --> 54:35.523
(screaming)

54:36.483 --> 54:39.235
Alright you owls, this is Edmond.

54:39.236 --> 54:42.947
It's over for you, we've got Chanticleer!

54:42.948 --> 54:45.158
(cheering)

54:48.411 --> 54:49.703
Where's my mom and dad?

54:49.704 --> 54:51.163
I can't see them.

54:51.164 --> 54:53.457
Don't worry, we'll find them.

54:53.458 --> 54:56.418
(rotors whirring)

54:56.419 --> 54:58.546
(screams)

55:02.050 --> 55:02.883
Ooh...

55:02.884 --> 55:03.717
How is he, Goldie?

55:03.718 --> 55:05.511
(groaning)

55:05.512 --> 55:07.471
I think he's waking up.

55:07.472 --> 55:10.266
Good, let's go in for a landing.

55:10.267 --> 55:11.059
Hold on!

55:13.228 --> 55:15.021
Ta-da, annihilation!

55:17.190 --> 55:17.983
Oh!

55:21.194 --> 55:22.486
(humming "Ride of the Valkyries")

55:22.487 --> 55:23.238
Aah!

55:30.829 --> 55:33.539
[Peepers] She's going down!

55:33.540 --> 55:35.750
Abandon ship, abandon ship!

55:40.088 --> 55:42.299
(laughing)

56:01.443 --> 56:02.401
Is it time for the show?

56:02.402 --> 56:03.861
King, you're heavy.

56:03.862 --> 56:07.240
Show me that stage, and gimme that mic.

56:08.825 --> 56:10.201
Oooh, where am I?

56:11.369 --> 56:13.454
Chanti, you're home.

56:13.455 --> 56:14.247
Huh?

56:17.959 --> 56:22.088
Ooh, I feel like I've been
hit by a 800-pound mule.

56:23.298 --> 56:24.131
What's happening?

56:24.132 --> 56:25.090
There's no time to explain.

56:25.091 --> 56:27.509
Chanticleer, you gotta
crow and you gotta crow now.

56:27.510 --> 56:29.762
The owls could be here any second.

56:29.763 --> 56:30.846
Who are you?

56:30.847 --> 56:32.806
He's a friend, now please, crow!

56:32.807 --> 56:36.310
Oh, I can't, I don't know if I ever did.

56:36.311 --> 56:37.519
Of course you did!

56:37.520 --> 56:39.229
Chanti, we were wrong.

56:39.230 --> 56:40.898
It's your job to bring up the sun.

56:40.899 --> 56:43.192
It hasn't shined since you left.

56:43.193 --> 56:44.902
Ah, but look.

56:44.903 --> 56:46.570
(wheezing)

56:46.571 --> 56:47.696
Cock-a-doo...

56:47.697 --> 56:48.490
Doo...

56:50.158 --> 56:51.450
Uh-oh.

56:51.451 --> 56:53.869
Aw, guys, it's no use.

56:53.870 --> 56:55.913
All I do now is sing the blues.

56:55.914 --> 56:57.373
Hmph, "the King."

56:57.374 --> 57:01.169
We don't want the King,
we want Chanticleer!

57:03.338 --> 57:04.755
(gasping)

57:04.756 --> 57:05.589
The Duke!

57:05.590 --> 57:07.634
(growls)

57:18.603 --> 57:21.438
(laughing)

57:21.439 --> 57:25.568
I know it's frightfully
impolite to eavesdrop like this,

57:27.112 --> 57:31.241
but are you by any chance
having trouble with your throat?

57:33.618 --> 57:34.828
Nothing to say?

57:40.917 --> 57:42.377
Cock-a-doodle-doo?

57:44.087 --> 57:44.879
Stop it!

57:46.089 --> 57:47.132
Chanti, crow!

57:49.092 --> 57:49.925
Shut up, you!

57:49.926 --> 57:51.385
Come on, you guys!

57:51.386 --> 57:52.886
Show him we believe.

57:52.887 --> 57:54.096
I told you to be quiet!

57:54.097 --> 57:57.182
Chanticleer, Chanticleer, Chanticleer,

57:57.183 --> 57:59.227
Chanticleer, Chanticleer!

58:03.148 --> 58:04.356
(choking)

58:04.357 --> 58:08.486
Duke, leave him alone,
it's me you want, not him.

58:12.031 --> 58:14.242
(laughing)

58:30.300 --> 58:32.509
Chanticleer...

58:32.510 --> 58:34.303
Chanticleer.

58:34.304 --> 58:36.014
Very stupid, Patou.

58:38.266 --> 58:41.519
Chanticleer, Chanticleer, Chanticleer.

58:42.937 --> 58:43.770
Look here, quiet!

58:43.771 --> 58:47.567
[All] Chanticleer,
Chanticleer, Chanticleer.

58:48.776 --> 58:51.321
(all chanting)

58:53.239 --> 58:55.324
Fools, all of you.

58:55.325 --> 58:56.117
Silence!

58:58.244 --> 59:00.371
I'll give you Chanticleer!

59:01.664 --> 59:05.460
[All] Chanticleer,
Chanticleer, Chanticleer!

59:27.690 --> 59:31.485
(maniacal laughter)

59:31.486 --> 59:34.279
Look, it's comin' up without him

59:34.280 --> 59:35.822
You're a phony.

59:35.823 --> 59:36.657
Are you by any chance having

59:36.658 --> 59:39.284
a little trouble with your throat?

59:39.285 --> 59:40.702
You're a phony.

59:40.703 --> 59:42.829
It's coming up without him.

59:42.830 --> 59:44.540
It's your job to bring up the sun.

59:44.541 --> 59:47.876
It hasn't shined since you left.

59:47.877 --> 59:50.420
(gasping)

59:50.421 --> 59:54.509
Chanticleer, you gotta
crow and you gotta crow now.

01:00:03.059 --> 01:00:04.352
Cock-a-dooooo,

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.567
Cock-a-dooooo,

01:00:13.736 --> 01:00:14.862
Cock-a-dooooo.

01:00:21.244 --> 01:00:23.371
(yelling)

01:00:35.133 --> 01:00:37.343
(coughing)

01:00:46.978 --> 01:00:47.854
Hehehehe!

01:00:49.439 --> 01:00:51.899
Hunch, it's me, Uncle Dukey.

01:00:52.942 --> 01:00:54.068
Uncle Dukey?

01:00:56.112 --> 01:00:56.904
Come here.

01:00:58.072 --> 01:00:59.197
Hunch, no!

01:00:59.198 --> 01:01:00.073
(chuckling)

01:01:00.074 --> 01:01:03.285
Animation, it's music to my ears.

01:01:03.286 --> 01:01:05.579
Hold still, you little twerp!

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:08.790
Aggravation, abomination, alienation.

01:01:08.791 --> 01:01:11.002
(laughing)

01:01:21.638 --> 01:01:24.556
[Patou] Well, our journey
had finally come to an end.

01:01:24.557 --> 01:01:28.977
Old Chanticleer was back
to stay, the sun was up,

01:01:28.978 --> 01:01:33.107
the rain had stopped, and
the owls were gone for good.

01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:39.613
Everything seemed to be
turning out just fine,

01:01:39.614 --> 01:01:41.991
except for one thing, Edmond.

01:01:44.952 --> 01:01:47.914
We just didn't know how to help him.

01:02:07.433 --> 01:02:08.392
(gasps)

01:02:08.393 --> 01:02:10.186
He was a little boy.

01:02:12.563 --> 01:02:15.441
Oh, he was a handsome little boy.

01:02:17.193 --> 01:02:18.653
Edmond, Edmond...

01:02:24.492 --> 01:02:25.868
Edmond, Edmond.

01:02:31.207 --> 01:02:31.999
Edmond...

01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:40.341
Edmond, Edmond, come on honey, wake up.

01:02:43.886 --> 01:02:46.264
(whimpering)

01:02:50.768 --> 01:02:51.978
Wake up, honey.

01:02:53.521 --> 01:02:54.397
Mom, Mom!

01:02:56.399 --> 01:02:58.900
Look, I'm not furry anymore!

01:02:58.901 --> 01:03:00.318
I'm a boy!

01:03:00.319 --> 01:03:02.863
Lie down, sweetheart.

01:03:02.864 --> 01:03:04.239
Mom, is that the sun?

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.866
Mm-hmm.

01:03:05.867 --> 01:03:08.661
Edmond, Edmond, get back into bed.

01:03:09.787 --> 01:03:10.620
Wow.

01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:12.248
Okay, take a look.

01:03:13.958 --> 01:03:16.585
Look, Mom, Chanticleer raised the sun.

01:03:16.586 --> 01:03:19.171
Hi Edmond, how you doing, son?

01:03:19.172 --> 01:03:22.048
Fine, but what happened
to Chanti and the gang?

01:03:22.049 --> 01:03:23.842
Mom, where are they?

01:03:23.843 --> 01:03:26.887
Edmond, Chanticleer is just a storybook.

01:03:26.888 --> 01:03:28.930
Those characters are only make-believe.

01:03:28.931 --> 01:03:30.265
Now come on, let's get back to bed.

01:03:30.266 --> 01:03:33.059
No mom, no they're not, I saw them.

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.520
I bet they're wondering
what happened to me.

01:03:35.521 --> 01:03:37.314
I wanna tell them I'm okay.

01:03:37.315 --> 01:03:38.607
I'm sure they know.

01:03:38.608 --> 01:03:39.817
You think so?

01:03:43.154 --> 01:03:44.946
They'll be just fine.

01:03:44.947 --> 01:03:46.865
[Patou] Edmond's mom
was right, of course,

01:03:46.866 --> 01:03:48.992
but she didn't know why.

01:03:48.993 --> 01:03:52.621
She also never knew just what
stopped the rain that night,

01:03:52.622 --> 01:03:54.331
but that just goes to show you,

01:03:54.332 --> 01:03:56.500
with a little help from your friends,

01:03:56.501 --> 01:03:58.585
you can do just about anything.

01:03:58.586 --> 01:04:01.254
Welcome home, Chanticleer.

01:04:01.255 --> 01:04:03.799
Thanks for bringing back the sun.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:08.261
♫ Cock-a-doooo-doodle-doodle-dooo-dooo

01:04:08.262 --> 01:04:09.387
[Edmond] Chanticleer!

01:04:09.388 --> 01:04:10.806
Hey, Edmond!

01:04:10.807 --> 01:04:11.599
Whoowee!

01:04:12.850 --> 01:04:14.851
♫ Cock-a-doo, what a day

01:04:14.852 --> 01:04:16.812
♫ The sun is shinin' brightly,

01:04:16.813 --> 01:04:18.730
♫ Cock-A-doo sunny day,

01:04:18.731 --> 01:04:20.816
♫ Down here on the farm

01:04:20.817 --> 01:04:22.943
♫ Cock-a-doo stay away

01:04:22.944 --> 01:04:24.945
♫ You big ol' wet ol' rain cloud

01:04:24.946 --> 01:04:29.075
♫ Or I'll cry out loud
with this voice of mine

01:04:30.827 --> 01:04:31.910
♫ Sun do shine

01:04:31.911 --> 01:04:34.704
♫ Sun do shine, sun do shine, sun do shine

♫ Sun do shine, sun do shine, sun do shine

01:04:38.918 --> 01:04:40.126
♫ Sun do shine

01:04:40.127 --> 01:04:43.296
♫ Sun do shine, sun do shine, sun do shine

01:04:43.297 --> 01:04:45.257
♫ Well, my daddy taught me how to sing

01:04:45.258 --> 01:04:47.676
♫ And that's why this
voice means everything

01:04:47.677 --> 01:04:50.095
♫ Sun do shine, you better shine

01:04:50.096 --> 01:04:51.179
♫ You better shine

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:54.099
♫ Well, the sun do shine, you better shine

01:04:54.100 --> 01:05:01.523
♫ You better shine

01:05:01.524 --> 01:05:02.649
♫ Sun do shine

01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:05.360
♫ Sun do shine, sun do shine, sun do shine

01:05:05.361 --> 01:05:06.611
♫ Sun do shine

01:05:06.612 --> 01:05:09.531
♫ Sun do shine, sun do shine, sun do shine

01:05:09.532 --> 01:05:10.574
♫ Well, the sun do shine

01:05:10.575 --> 01:05:13.577
♫ Sun do shine, sun do shine, sun do shine

01:05:13.578 --> 01:05:15.745
♫ Well, my daddy taught me how to sing

01:05:15.746 --> 01:05:18.206
♫ And that's why this
voice means everything

01:05:18.207 --> 01:05:20.667
♫ Sun do shine, you better shine

01:05:20.668 --> 01:05:22.127
♫ You better shine

01:05:22.128 --> 01:05:24.588
♫ Well, the sun do shine, you better shine

01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:31.970
♫ You better shine

01:05:31.971 --> 01:05:36.100
♫ You better shine, Sun, you better shine!

01:05:40.813 --> 01:05:43.941
♫ Digidigidigidowdow!

01:05:45.234 --> 01:05:49.363

♫ shoe bah doo bah, tyin' your shoes

♫ This old dog has paid his dues

01:06:05.171 --> 01:06:08.632
♫ But I can still learn a new trick or two

01:06:08.633 --> 01:06:12.761
♫ 'Cause I've been over,
around, under and through

01:06:12.762 --> 01:06:13.678
♫ Tyin' your shoes

01:06:13.679 --> 01:06:17.557
♫ Life is just like tyin' your shoes

01:06:17.558 --> 01:06:20.268
♫ Now half the world is singin' the blues

01:06:20.269 --> 01:06:21.353
♫ Singin' the blues

01:06:21.354 --> 01:06:24.564
♫ But I've learned if you laugh
you've got nothing to lose

01:06:24.565 --> 01:06:28.193
♫ Cause I've been over,
around, under and through

01:06:28.194 --> 01:06:29.527

♫ Now when you try

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:35.659
♫ When you try

01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:37.661
♫ Something new

01:06:37.662 --> 01:06:39.537
♫ Now, you're bound to make mistakes

01:06:39.538 --> 01:06:40.830
♫ You'll make mistakes

01:06:40.831 --> 01:06:44.793
♫ Hey, but, no use cryin',
just keep on tryin'

01:06:44.794 --> 01:06:48.046

♫ Tyin' your shoes

01:06:53.135 --> 01:06:56.429
♫ Now I's ready to roll and
I' all ready to burn, you see
