WEBVTT

00:02.750 --> 00:04.375
All right, guys, stand back.

00:10.083 --> 00:12.333
What's the big deal, Jack?
you've done that 1,000 times.

00:12.417 --> 00:13.792
Wait for it.

00:16.959 --> 00:19.000
Whoa!

00:20.083 --> 00:21.875
Man, I’d give you a million bucks

00:21.959 --> 00:23.417
if you could do that to my cello.

00:24.959 --> 00:27.875
Playas don't play the cello.

00:29.375 --> 00:31.041
Well, you're not a <i>playa.</i>

00:32.041 --> 00:34.417
I will be when I get rid
of that dang cello.

00:36.125 --> 00:37.500
I'm going to get a smoothie.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.875
-
<i>No, no!</i>

00:43.959 --> 00:46.208
<i>Don't you die on me, not now!</i>

00:46.291 --> 00:48.375
<i>It's not your time!</i>

00:48.458 --> 00:50.166
What's going on in there?

00:50.250 --> 00:52.250
Rudy's toilet's clogged again.

00:57.375 --> 00:58.250
Poor Myrtle.

00:59.125 --> 01:00.500
I almost lost her.

01:01.792 --> 01:04.375
Twice I had to plunge her back to life.

01:05.667 --> 01:07.750
How do you know
if a toilet's a boy or a girl?

01:07.834 --> 01:09.917
You take the top off the tank,

01:10.000 --> 01:11.625
you reach your arm in,
and you feel around--

01:11.709 --> 01:12.792
Stop!

01:14.041 --> 01:15.417
I think I’d rather hear about this

01:15.500 --> 01:17.750
in an awkward conversation with my father.

01:19.166 --> 01:21.166
-
- Rudy, focus.

01:21.250 --> 01:23.208
The new owner of the mall's
gonna be here any minute.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.750
Hey, you guys gotta check this out.

01:25.834 --> 01:27.834
These brochures are all over the place.

01:27.917 --> 01:29.834
This new owner's making some big changes.

01:31.166 --> 01:33.750
Wow, they finally moved
the baby changing area

01:33.834 --> 01:34.917
out of the food court.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.917
And if you ask me, that was a big step
in the right direction.

01:39.375 --> 01:42.166
No way! They're bringing
in a Captain Corndog!

01:42.250 --> 01:44.500
Oh, snap! That's a classy joint.

01:45.542 --> 01:48.083
Yeah, my sister got married
in a Captain Corndog.

01:48.166 --> 01:50.208
The Captain
walked her down the plank himself.

01:51.375 --> 01:53.667
Whoa, look at that huge new parking lot.

01:53.750 --> 01:55.291
Wait a minute, where's our dojo?

01:55.375 --> 01:57.667
There's a parking lot
where our dojo should be.

01:59.250 --> 02:00.542
Whoa.

02:02.709 --> 02:06.166

02:46.542 --> 02:50.125
- Oh, Mr. Turner, welcome to my dojo.
- Nice to meet you, Rudy.

02:50.208 --> 02:52.625
- This is my son Arthur.
- Hello, sir.

02:52.709 --> 02:55.166
What a wonderful dojo you have here.

02:55.250 --> 02:57.375
Let me ask you, how do you do it?

02:57.458 --> 03:01.250
A sensei, a businessman
and obviously a male model.

03:02.333 --> 03:04.083
Yeah, I know, totally.

03:04.166 --> 03:05.709
It's because I’m-- look at me.

03:06.792 --> 03:09.250
Arthur, go make some friends
while Rudy and I talk.

03:09.333 --> 03:10.417
Yes, Daddy.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.417
You and Rudy go have a good talk,
all right?

03:12.500 --> 03:14.166
I’ll just-- I’ll just be out here
with the gang.

03:14.250 --> 03:17.291
- Okay, okay.
- Hey, I’m Jack. How are you doing?

03:17.375 --> 03:21.375
So what do you losers do
all day around this dump?

03:21.458 --> 03:23.750
Sit around and pretend to know karate?

03:24.917 --> 03:26.959
Yo, pretend to know karate?

03:27.291 --> 03:28.709
Check this out.

03:31.250 --> 03:32.458
Go ahead, show him, Jack.

03:35.250 --> 03:36.458
Yeah.
- Come on, Jack.

03:36.542 --> 03:38.083
<i>Come on, dude.
You got this.</i>

03:38.166 --> 03:40.000
<i>You got this, dude. Come on.</i>

03:48.917 --> 03:50.291
Yeah!

03:51.917 --> 03:53.917
That was nothing.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.500
You guys wanna see some real karate moves?

03:57.250 --> 03:58.500
Watch this.

04:08.333 --> 04:09.333
Uh-oh.

04:11.083 --> 04:13.375
- What was that?
- I can't believe it, sir.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.417
That kid just busted up all your trophies.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.250
Milton, you are in big trouble.

04:17.333 --> 04:19.333
What? It wasn't Milton. It was Arthur.

04:20.125 --> 04:22.458
Oh. Well, accidents happen.

04:23.667 --> 04:25.417
Thank you for showing us

04:25.500 --> 04:27.583
what a dangerous place that is
to keep trophies.

04:28.917 --> 04:31.875
Now everyone,
give our newest member Arthur

04:31.959 --> 04:34.166
a big Bobby Wasabi welcome.

04:40.667 --> 04:41.792
What?

04:41.875 --> 04:44.041
I love clapping. Whoo!

04:51.375 --> 04:52.959
Ya, ya, ya! Ya!

04:53.041 --> 04:54.917
- Hi-yah!
- Ah!

04:55.000 --> 04:57.125
- Kim, take it easy.
- Sorry, Eddie.

04:57.208 --> 05:00.542
I’m just so sick and tired of being looked
at as just another pretty face.

05:00.625 --> 05:03.417
Oh, welcome to my world, sister.

05:05.417 --> 05:08.750
I mean, what's the point of being
a reporter for the school TV station

05:08.834 --> 05:10.166
if Margaret Bork thinks I’m just

05:10.250 --> 05:13.500
some "airhead" southern belle
who can't do real news?

05:13.583 --> 05:15.917
Oh, man!

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
You guys should've seen what we just did.

05:18.083 --> 05:19.917
It was a riot.

05:20.583 --> 05:22.625
It was like taking candy from a baby.

05:23.667 --> 05:25.125
That's what you actually did, Arthur.

05:25.208 --> 05:27.208
You took candy from a baby.

05:28.250 --> 05:30.834
Hey, could-- could I get in on that?

05:30.917 --> 05:31.750
Thanks.

05:32.458 --> 05:35.125
Nothing tastes better than
Something stolen from a baby.

05:40.583 --> 05:41.542
I don't get it, Rudy.

05:41.625 --> 05:43.250
Why does Arthur have to join our dojo?

05:43.333 --> 05:44.500
Why do we have to be his friends?

05:45.542 --> 05:47.583
And why are you sitting on a toilet?

05:49.375 --> 05:52.125
This new high-tech toilet
is a gift from Mr. Turner.

05:52.792 --> 05:54.709
So you're just throwing Myrtle away?

05:54.792 --> 05:56.417
After everything you put her through?

05:56.500 --> 05:58.458
Oh, please,
Myrtle's just an old flush bucket.

05:58.542 --> 06:00.291
The magic was gone years ago.

06:01.417 --> 06:03.542
We were just going through the motions.

06:04.375 --> 06:06.709
Oh, okay, I see what this is about.

06:06.792 --> 06:08.750
You sold us out for a new toilet.

06:10.041 --> 06:11.709
I saved our dojo.

06:12.291 --> 06:15.166
When Mr. Turner was saying that Arthur
was having a hard time making friends,

06:15.250 --> 06:17.375
I jumped on it and said
he could make friends right here.

06:18.125 --> 06:19.875
Rudy, we don't want
to be friends with him.

06:19.959 --> 06:22.417
Friends are loyal. Friends have your back.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.375
Now come on, just promise me

06:24.458 --> 06:27.208
that you'll try
and make this Arthur thing work.

06:28.041 --> 06:28.875
Fine.

06:28.959 --> 06:30.500
If it means saving the dojo,

06:30.583 --> 06:32.959
I’ll give the spoiled little brat
a chance.

06:33.041 --> 06:34.333
See? That's the spirit.

06:35.250 --> 06:36.500
Hey, Jack, check this out.

06:37.667 --> 06:40.834
<i>The Evacutron 5000
is now ready for boarding.</i>

06:41.834 --> 06:43.542
<i>Would you like your seat warmed?</i>

06:44.750 --> 06:47.291
If this thing could cook,
I would totally marry it.

06:49.083 --> 06:50.417
Apparently it can cook.

06:53.792 --> 06:56.125
Your, uh, toilet waffles are ready.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.583
- Are you sure you want to eat those?
- No.

07:00.542 --> 07:01.750
Not without syrup.

07:04.709 --> 07:06.458
Ooh.

07:10.125 --> 07:11.375
Margaret, come on.

07:11.458 --> 07:13.542
There are so many important stories
I could cover.

07:13.625 --> 07:16.208
Kimmy, you're good at pretty,
you're good at perky,

07:16.250 --> 07:18.291
but you can't handle the big stories.

07:18.375 --> 07:20.375
And that's why I’m the head reporter.

07:20.458 --> 07:21.583
Here's your assignment.

07:25.166 --> 07:26.333
Seriously?

07:27.542 --> 07:29.375
I'm standing here with Mrs. Lubinski,

07:29.458 --> 07:31.208
the teacher that fell asleep
during detention

07:31.291 --> 07:33.375
and was swarmed by a gang of spit-ballers.

07:35.125 --> 07:36.291
Any comments?

07:45.125 --> 07:47.458
- Whoa, what's this?
- It's a gift.

07:48.583 --> 07:50.333
I know I’ve been a little bit of a jerk.

07:50.417 --> 07:51.875
A little bit of a jerk?

07:51.959 --> 07:54.250
That's like saying
Jerry's a little bit confused.

07:54.375 --> 07:55.959
What?

07:56.041 --> 07:57.250
Wait, what'd I miss?

07:58.709 --> 08:00.250
I'm confused.

08:00.333 --> 08:03.333
Look, to show you that I’m not <i>all</i> bad,

08:03.417 --> 08:05.000
I got you guys this brand-new

08:05.083 --> 08:07.250
State-of-the-art punching dummy.

08:07.333 --> 08:09.625
You know what, Arthur?
Maybe I had you wrong.

08:09.709 --> 08:13.250
- That's a pretty cool move.
- All right, that's more like it.

08:13.333 --> 08:17.125
Now I think I should be the one
to break this bad boy in.

08:17.208 --> 08:18.291
Whoo!

08:21.834 --> 08:23.917
-
- Whoa!

08:24.000 --> 08:25.583
<i>Oh, man, that was good!</i>

08:25.667 --> 08:28.542
See, I told you guys
it was a punching dummy.

08:28.625 --> 08:29.792
You get it?

08:30.709 --> 08:32.750
It's on, dummy. It's on.

08:34.375 --> 08:36.125
- That's it.
- Jack, you can't do this.

08:36.208 --> 08:37.375
You promised Rudy.

08:38.750 --> 08:41.250
- But I didn't.
- No, Kim.

08:41.333 --> 08:43.875
- I want him all to myself.
- No, Eddie.

08:43.959 --> 08:45.458
This one's all me.

08:47.333 --> 08:48.959
Wait, why can't Jack do this?

08:49.625 --> 08:51.917
Guys, let's just start practice.

08:52.667 --> 08:55.458
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Jack. I got this.

08:56.125 --> 09:00.041
Since Rudy’s not around
and I outrank everyone,

09:00.125 --> 09:01.291
I'll lead the class.

09:01.375 --> 09:04.250
Are you nuts? You don't outrank Jack.

09:04.333 --> 09:05.458
Really?

09:05.542 --> 09:07.667
See, I don't know if you noticed,

09:07.750 --> 09:09.333
but I’m a green belt.

09:10.125 --> 09:12.625
Yeah, because your daddy
bought it for you.

09:12.709 --> 09:15.542
Jack, you don't know anything
about karate.

09:15.625 --> 09:18.333
You're nothing but
a scrawny little skate rat.

09:21.792 --> 09:26.166
And you're nothing
but a spoiled little poser.

09:29.667 --> 09:31.375
- Poser, huh?
- Yeah.

09:32.875 --> 09:33.959
That's it.

09:37.375 --> 09:38.709
<i>Whoa!</i>

09:40.208 --> 09:43.000
- Whoa!
- You're gonna be sorry you did that!

09:44.333 --> 09:47.583
- What is going on?
- It's a good thing you're here, Dad.

09:47.667 --> 09:50.959
I was just saying my prayers
and eating my vitamins,

09:51.041 --> 09:52.917
and Jack threw me into this wall.

09:54.583 --> 09:55.959
We had a deal, Rudy.

09:56.041 --> 09:57.959
You said this was a warm, safe environment

09:58.041 --> 09:59.917
where Arthur could learn karate
and make friends.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.542
Jack, did you throw Arthur
into our wall of friendship?

10:07.542 --> 10:09.041
Uh...

10:09.125 --> 10:10.834
They don't do that to just anyone.

10:10.917 --> 10:12.625
They must really like you.

10:13.125 --> 10:14.250
Don't you, Jack?

10:14.834 --> 10:16.417
Rudy, I didn't want to fight him.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.083
He just came right at me.

10:18.166 --> 10:20.083
He came at you, you came at him--

10:20.166 --> 10:22.125
It's like a big comin' at you party
in here.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.625
All right, back to practice,
you loveable scamps.

10:26.709 --> 10:30.000
- Yeah.
- Rudy, this is unacceptable.

10:30.083 --> 10:31.792
I want Jack thrown out of your dojo.

10:31.875 --> 10:33.250
- What?
- What?

10:33.333 --> 10:34.750
Bye-bye, Jack.

10:37.959 --> 10:39.959
I’m sorry, Mr. Turner,
but that's not gonna happen.

10:40.792 --> 10:44.041
Okay, then. You have two hours to get out.

10:44.125 --> 10:46.667
You're standing on the site
of my new parking lot.

10:47.583 --> 10:48.667
Come on, son.

10:52.417 --> 10:55.000
<i>It's time for your 3:30 appointment.</i>

10:55.083 --> 10:57.125
Oh, shut up.

10:57.208 --> 11:00.000
<i>I get it.
It's because I’m a toilet, isn't it?</i>

11:11.250 --> 11:13.208
Jack, put your stuff down.
You're not leaving.

11:13.250 --> 11:15.458
If I don't leave,
you're all gonna lose the dojo.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.917
I'm not gonna let that happen.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.333
No, no, no. You're not going.

11:19.041 --> 11:22.208
Sometimes in life a man has to decide
what's really important.

11:22.250 --> 11:25.250
Hey, not my toilet! Take the boy instead!

11:25.375 --> 11:26.917
- Rudy!
- Well, I’m sorry,

11:27.000 --> 11:28.375
but you've never sat on her.

11:29.208 --> 11:30.959
We're not gonna take this, man.

11:31.041 --> 11:32.625
We gotta fight the power, yo.

11:34.250 --> 11:37.250
Jerry's right. We've gotta fight back.

11:37.333 --> 11:38.834
Like that guy on Meyer Avenue

11:38.917 --> 11:40.583
who chained himself to that old oak tree

11:40.667 --> 11:41.875
so they wouldn't cut it down.

11:41.959 --> 11:43.959
He stood his ground and saved that tree.

11:44.041 --> 11:47.083
Until it fell over in a storm,
destroyed my Aunt Verna’s house

11:47.166 --> 11:48.709
and she had to move into my room.

11:50.709 --> 11:53.375
I've seen things no boy my age should see.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.208
Gah!

12:00.458 --> 12:01.542
<i>You know what?</i>

12:01.625 --> 12:03.208
You guys are onto something.

12:03.250 --> 12:05.583
What Turner's doing is wrong
and we gotta fight back.

12:05.667 --> 12:08.917
- What are you saying, Rudy?
- I’m saying they can't tear down the dojo

12:09.000 --> 12:10.667
If I’m chained to that post.

12:10.750 --> 12:14.125
And I will fight the good fight
for as long as it takes.

12:14.208 --> 12:17.041
So chain me up.

12:17.125 --> 12:18.875
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

12:19.667 --> 12:22.875
Get these things off me!
I can't take it anymore.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.709
I'm going crazy!

12:24.792 --> 12:27.709
Rudy, it's only been three minutes.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.709
Yeah, you know, well,
if it's such a great story,

12:30.750 --> 12:32.333
why don't you cover it yourself?

12:33.625 --> 12:36.625
That was Margaret trying to give me
another lame story to cover.

12:36.709 --> 12:39.625
- Well, what was it this time?
- Big news in the cafeteria,

12:39.709 --> 12:43.542
apparently Taco Tuesdays
is becoming Fajita Friday.

12:43.625 --> 12:44.834
Yes!

12:44.917 --> 12:48.125
You slip the lunch lady
a box of chocolates and a cat calendar--

12:48.208 --> 12:50.458
Oh, you can move mountains, baby!

12:51.542 --> 12:53.667
All this talk about food
is getting me hungry.

12:53.750 --> 12:55.709
I’m going over to Honey Buns
to hook us up.

12:55.792 --> 12:57.917
No, no, no. You can't go out there, man.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.625
That's just what they want.

12:59.709 --> 13:01.792
You go out that door,
it's like we've given up.

13:01.875 --> 13:04.083
Well, eventually we're gonna
need something to eat.

13:04.166 --> 13:08.000
You know, our air vent connects
with the nail salon.

13:08.083 --> 13:10.500
Those ladies are always
snacking on something.

13:10.583 --> 13:11.667
Yeah, he's right.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.375
Yeah, but who's skinny enough
to fit through that vent?

13:18.542 --> 13:19.667
Oh.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.125
Oh!

13:38.542 --> 13:39.959
Let's do this.

13:41.583 --> 13:44.291
-
- I think the exhaust fan just kicked on.

13:44.375 --> 13:46.208
- What makes you say that?
-

13:46.291 --> 13:49.417
whoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo!

13:49.875 --> 13:51.083
No reason.

13:55.500 --> 13:56.500
Oh, check it out.

13:56.583 --> 13:58.083
Turner just showed up with some people.

13:59.417 --> 14:01.709
Attention dojo squatters,

14:01.834 --> 14:03.458
you have five minutes to get out.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.417
<i>We are bringing in
a wrecking ball.</i>

14:05.500 --> 14:07.500
You don't scare us, Turner.

14:07.583 --> 14:09.709
That whole bringing-in-
a-wrecking-ball routine--

14:09.792 --> 14:11.333
It's the oldest trick in the book.

14:14.792 --> 14:16.000
Uh, Rudy?

14:16.083 --> 14:18.333
They just brought in a wrecking ball.

14:18.417 --> 14:21.625
What? Unchain me, you fools!

14:21.709 --> 14:24.000
We can't. You gave the keys to Milton.

14:24.083 --> 14:26.625
What? No, it can't end like this.

14:26.709 --> 14:28.875
I never sat in a hot tub full of pudding.

14:29.542 --> 14:32.166
No, wait. Yes, I did.
No, that was custard.

14:34.792 --> 14:37.125
Smash it up, Daddy. Smash it up good.

14:37.208 --> 14:38.917
We're not gonna smash anything, Arthur.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.083
we're just bringing in
the wrecking ball to scare them out.

14:41.166 --> 14:43.875
Well, it's not working. Nobody is leaving.

14:43.959 --> 14:44.959
Oh, they'll leave.

14:45.041 --> 14:46.583
I just cranked up the air conditioning.

14:46.667 --> 14:48.208
They have to be freezing in there.

14:53.250 --> 14:55.709
Nothing brings a crowd out
like a wrecking ball.

14:55.792 --> 14:59.417
They're totally on our side.
You can feel the love.

15:02.375 --> 15:04.333
Knock it down! Knock it down!
Knock it down!

15:04.417 --> 15:06.208
Why don't you guys shut your pie holes?

15:09.166 --> 15:11.000
Y'all, I just realized

15:11.083 --> 15:13.500
I’m right in the middle
of a really big story,

15:13.583 --> 15:16.750
four kids from our school
fighting a great injustice.

15:16.834 --> 15:18.250
Kim, you'd better get out there.

15:18.333 --> 15:20.208
Your friend Margaret Bork just showed up.

15:21.583 --> 15:22.917
Oh, no she didn't.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.166
Not today, Margaret. Not today!

15:28.333 --> 15:29.917
-
- Whoa!

15:40.875 --> 15:44.417
In two minutes we're turning
this place into a parking lot.

15:45.709 --> 15:46.917
I'm going out there.

15:52.709 --> 15:54.208
All right, I’ve got some demands, people.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.750
All right, now we're
gonna need a big bag of cheeseburgers,

15:57.834 --> 16:00.875
some fries, some juice boxes and--

16:00.959 --> 16:03.291
And throw in some of those
glow-in-the-dark straws.

16:03.375 --> 16:05.250
Yeah, they make drinking fun, you know?

16:05.333 --> 16:08.542
- Your demands stink.
Yeah!

16:08.625 --> 16:10.834
I wasn't finished. Ugh.

16:11.667 --> 16:12.875
And uh-- and I’m also gonna need

16:12.959 --> 16:16.166
a couple of helicopters
flown by supermodels.

16:16.583 --> 16:20.500
- Now those are some demands!
- Whoo!

16:20.583 --> 16:22.375
All right. Thank you, thank you.

16:22.458 --> 16:23.834
Yeah. Now who's with me?

16:23.917 --> 16:26.458
- Wasabi!
Wasabi! Wasabi! Wasabi!

16:26.542 --> 16:29.750
- <i>Yeah, Wasabi!</i>
-

16:29.834 --> 16:32.583
Wasabi! Yeah, Wasabi!

16:32.667 --> 16:35.291
- Where's Arthur?
Wasabi! Wasabi!

16:38.250 --> 16:39.458
Heh heh.

16:42.083 --> 16:44.583
Margaret Bork bringing you
another exclusive story.

16:44.667 --> 16:47.792
Behind me is the scene
of a tense downtown stand-off.

16:52.583 --> 16:55.834
- Margaret, get out of the way!
- I’m on the air, Kim.

17:02.917 --> 17:04.333
Aah!

17:11.291 --> 17:13.250
Yo, Arthur’s lost it, you guys.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.208
A few more swings and this dojo's history.

17:16.125 --> 17:17.375
What are we gonna do?

17:20.083 --> 17:21.083
I got this.

17:32.125 --> 17:34.000
Probably not my best idea.

17:40.500 --> 17:43.542
- What's up, Arthur?
- Jack, you're too late.

17:43.625 --> 17:45.083
I don't think I am.

17:46.709 --> 17:48.875
You can't do anything without the keys.

18:15.375 --> 18:17.458
Say goodbye to your dojo, Jack.

18:38.375 --> 18:41.709
-
- Yes!

18:50.875 --> 18:53.625
I’m live on the scene here
at the Bobby Wasabi Dojo.

18:53.709 --> 18:55.333
We have an eyewitness to the action--

18:55.417 --> 18:57.458
Our own head reporter Margaret Bork.

18:57.542 --> 18:58.959
Margaret, in your own words,

18:59.041 --> 19:00.542
would you tell us what you saw?

19:00.625 --> 19:03.792
So big, so round, so coming at me.

19:03.875 --> 19:06.875
Coming at me.

19:06.959 --> 19:09.125
Well said, Margaret.
There you have it, folks.

19:09.208 --> 19:11.083
I'm Kim Crawford and I have a feeling

19:11.166 --> 19:13.792
- y'all will be seeing a lot more of me.
-

19:15.083 --> 19:16.333
Is everyone okay in here?

19:16.417 --> 19:19.375
Look, turner, you win, all right?

19:19.458 --> 19:21.709
Just go ahead and take your dojo back.

19:21.792 --> 19:24.000
<i>Put up your parking lot.
But you know what?</i>

19:24.083 --> 19:25.083
We're proud.

19:25.166 --> 19:26.875
And we will hold our heads high.

19:26.959 --> 19:28.166
Really?

19:29.834 --> 19:31.333
Hands over the head-- that's all it took.

19:33.875 --> 19:35.375
I think this belongs to you.

19:35.458 --> 19:38.375
Arthur, how could you do
something like this?

19:38.458 --> 19:39.625
I've given you everything.

19:39.709 --> 19:42.542
- Eh. Maybe that's the problem.
- What do you mean?

19:42.625 --> 19:44.125
Well, this dojo might not be much,

19:44.208 --> 19:46.709
but it's built on the principles
of discipline and respect,

19:46.792 --> 19:48.792
a couple of things Arthur
obviously doesn't have.

19:48.875 --> 19:50.417
Blah, blah, blah.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.875
Look, can we just knock down
their little dump now, Dad?

19:52.959 --> 19:54.792
No. He's right.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.750
I'm sorry, Rudy. Your dojo can stay.

19:58.834 --> 20:00.917
- Yes!
- Yes! Whoo!

20:01.000 --> 20:03.875
Arthur, get in the car. You're grounded.

20:03.959 --> 20:04.959
Grounded?

20:06.333 --> 20:08.333
What does that even mean?

20:08.417 --> 20:10.166
I think you're about to find out.

20:10.917 --> 20:12.208
Bye-bye, Arthur.

20:14.417 --> 20:15.458
Ooh.

20:15.542 --> 20:18.250
Jack, what you did was incredible.

20:18.375 --> 20:20.792
It wasn't just me. We all did it.

20:22.583 --> 20:25.000
Wait a minute. Has anyone seen Milton?

20:31.083 --> 20:34.166
Tina, you are so much better
off without him.

20:35.166 --> 20:36.875
You know what I say?

20:36.959 --> 20:38.417
Change the locks,

20:38.500 --> 20:40.875
make yourself a nice bubble bath

20:40.959 --> 20:43.709
and, girl, get your cry on.

20:48.291 --> 20:50.125
Ow, ow. Take it easy.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.667
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

20:55.166 --> 20:57.709
-
- Who's there?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.458
Evacutron?

21:04.542 --> 21:06.041
<i>I've come back to see you, Rudy.</i>

21:07.208 --> 21:08.333
What do you want?

21:10.959 --> 21:12.375
<i>You know what I want.</i>

21:13.542 --> 21:16.208
- But I just went 10 minutes ago.
- <i>What?</i>

21:16.375 --> 21:19.542
<i>You've cheated on me? How could you, Rudy?</i>

21:19.625 --> 21:21.583
I never thought I would see you again.

21:21.667 --> 21:22.959
<i>Well, now you won't!</i>

21:25.667 --> 21:26.792
No.

21:28.125 --> 21:31.083
It was just a port-o-potty.
She meant nothing to me.
