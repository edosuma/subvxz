WEBVTT

00:24.607 --> 00:26.568
Wait, who the hell are you?

00:26.651 --> 00:29.529
- I'm Bean.
- Okay, highly unlikely, smartass.

00:29.612 --> 00:32.115
Well, I mean to say
that I'm Bean, as well.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.451
- No, I'm Bean.
- No, I'm Bean.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.494
- No, I'm Bean.
- No, I'm Bean.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.413
Look, I'm the one and only Bean.

00:38.496 --> 00:40.373
So self-centered.

00:40.457 --> 00:43.293
Okay, screw you, uh,
and your tacky red room.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.336
Angry, too, I like it.

00:45.420 --> 00:46.713
Is that better?

00:46.796 --> 00:50.383
All right, tell me who you really are
before I slam your nose off.

00:50.467 --> 00:54.137
Well, I'm Queen Tiabeanie Mariabeanie
De La Rochambeaux Drunkowitz.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.264
Well, then why are you
dressed up like Dagmar?

00:56.806 --> 00:58.349
I'm not. I'm you.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.976
Well, the dream-time you.

01:00.059 --> 01:02.937
I hide inside your head
and come out when you fall asleep

01:03.021 --> 01:05.565
or pass out drunk or snooze till noon.

01:05.648 --> 01:07.609
I'm that little voice whispering,

01:07.692 --> 01:11.946
"Have a fifth beer, Bean."
And, "Have a sixth beer, Bean."

01:12.030 --> 01:14.783
And, "Steal Grandma's
gold tooth and drive Dad crazy!"

01:14.866 --> 01:17.660
All right. I already have a demon
that does all of that.

01:17.744 --> 01:18.870
Well, lucky you.

01:18.953 --> 01:21.623
I mean, who else has two bad influences?

01:21.706 --> 01:23.541
Okay, you're Bad Bean.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.251
I'm going to call you Bad Bean.

01:25.335 --> 01:28.880
We're both "Bad Bean," babe,
but I'm way more than that.

01:28.963 --> 01:33.426
I know all your dirty, dark secrets
and your stupid, neurotic ones

01:33.510 --> 01:35.095
that you just go on and on about.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.596
I know what turns you on, Bean.

01:36.679 --> 01:42.936
I happen to know that little miss Bean
likes her neck nuzzled… a lot.

01:43.603 --> 01:47.273
I'm sorry, but I'm pretty sure
everybody likes their neck nuzzled.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.901
If I were
to show you the analytics

01:49.984 --> 01:52.195
of how much you fantasize about it…

01:52.278 --> 01:53.988
All right, what are analytics?

01:54.072 --> 01:56.074
If you didn't
think about neck nuzzling so much,

01:56.157 --> 01:58.034
you'd know what analytics were, Bean!

01:58.118 --> 02:00.328
And I also know
where you hide the muffins.

02:00.411 --> 02:01.412
You know what--

02:01.496 --> 02:03.581
Also, I'm just going to say that

02:03.665 --> 02:06.501
the muffins,
they're not hidden, all right?

02:06.584 --> 02:09.420
Like, I happen to have
guests over sometimes.

02:09.504 --> 02:15.510
And so I have muffins around
and available like a good host.

02:15.593 --> 02:18.179
Yeah, sometimes I eat them all.
But don't shame me.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.014
Enough with your spinning.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.933
You need to get a hold of yourself.

02:22.016 --> 02:24.102
- Listen, there's something I want, too.

02:24.185 --> 02:26.020
I'm not just here for fun, okay?

02:26.104 --> 02:27.730
We've got a curse to get rid of.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.900
Oh, "a curse." Is there, like,
a bunch of people coming in,

02:30.984 --> 02:32.944
'cause it seems like
there's just a curse a day.

02:33.027 --> 02:34.821
Which one we talking about today?

02:34.904 --> 02:36.364
We'll figure this out together.

02:36.447 --> 02:40.076
Just know, the whole time,
I'm going to be watching you.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.787
I'm gonna be guiding you,
and I'm gonna be pushing you.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.549
I can't believe I got murdered
in my own dream.

02:54.632 --> 02:55.550
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:55.633 --> 02:57.760
- Pump the brakes. Who killed you?
- Me.

02:57.844 --> 03:02.599
I mean, at least she looked like me,
and talked like me, and had my moves down.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.559
- Sounds like you.
- Her name is Bad Bean.

03:04.642 --> 03:05.476
Sounds like you.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.022
According to this, you don't wanna mess
with murdering yourself in dreams.

03:09.105 --> 03:09.939
Why not?

03:10.023 --> 03:11.900
You might get stuck
in the dream world forever.

03:11.983 --> 03:13.610
Happened of my evil twin, Guci.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.154
Guci? Well, you're the evil twin
if you ask me.

03:17.488 --> 03:20.200
- Oh, burn.
- Such impertinence.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.702
I ought to slap you
with my gentleman's glove.

03:22.785 --> 03:25.455
Ow! What the hell
kind of gentlemen's glove is that?

03:25.538 --> 03:26.831
The kind filled with gravel.

03:26.915 --> 03:30.168
Now, as I was saying,
Guci is the evil twin,

03:30.251 --> 03:34.756
while I, Luci, am the eviler twin,
capisce?

03:34.839 --> 03:35.798
And…

03:38.593 --> 03:40.178
- Quit clowning around, boys.

03:40.261 --> 03:41.095
Give me that tea.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.973
Nobody murders me and gets away with it.

03:44.641 --> 03:45.767
Okay, take it easy.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.101
- This is strong stuff.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.562
You gotta sip slowly, daintily.

03:54.108 --> 03:56.069
- Or glugging is good.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.320
- Mmm…
- Aw!

03:57.403 --> 04:00.406
How come everybody else
gets to solve their murders but me?

04:00.490 --> 04:02.617
Yeah, but you're just so killable.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.717
Bad Bean…

04:20.301 --> 04:21.678
Where are you?

04:22.512 --> 04:24.931
I just… I wanted to show you something.

04:25.014 --> 04:26.516
I made you something.

04:27.475 --> 04:28.851
Bad Bean.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.523
Oh, there you are. Hi.

04:33.606 --> 04:34.774
You're looking good tonight.

04:34.857 --> 04:37.443
Well, you're saying that
'cause you look exactly like me.

04:37.527 --> 04:40.113
If I were you, I'd take a compliment
where I could get one.

04:40.196 --> 04:43.408
If you're really me,
tell me something only I would know.

04:43.491 --> 04:46.995
A mermaid's kiss tastes like
mango and tide pool.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.663
Huh. Okay.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.748
My, what a big sword you have!

04:50.832 --> 04:52.500
I love it when you're mad.

04:52.583 --> 04:56.087
Now, before you rush at me,
I just want to remind you

04:56.170 --> 04:57.588
that I'm as fast as you are.

04:58.923 --> 04:59.882
Oh, no.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.884
- Whoa, that was fast.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.386
Did you die again like a chump?

05:03.469 --> 05:05.513
Right through the trapdoor. Damn it.

05:05.596 --> 05:06.806
Mmm, how humiliating.

05:06.889 --> 05:08.891
And I went over the waterfall in a globe.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.185
I'm going back. More tea, Mop Girl.
Come on.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.896
- Don't do it, Bean. Dreams are tricky.
- Shut up, Luci.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.441
I'm Guci… or am I?

05:16.524 --> 05:18.318
Sometimes I don't even know anymore.

05:18.401 --> 05:19.777
Or do I?

05:19.861 --> 05:21.446
Or don't I?

05:21.529 --> 05:23.072
Or do I?

05:23.156 --> 05:25.199
What were you saying? Who's talking?

05:25.283 --> 05:26.784
Who am I talking to?

05:26.868 --> 05:28.161
Who am I anymore?

05:28.703 --> 05:31.372
God, I miss Guci… or Luci.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.499
There's no escaping this conversation.

05:33.583 --> 05:34.917
Or is there?

05:38.421 --> 05:39.339
Hot!

06:06.115 --> 06:07.408
Whoa!

06:07.492 --> 06:09.410
Whoopsie. You dropped something.

06:10.495 --> 06:11.746
Oh, come on.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.624
No blood. Both ears.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.376
More tea. Come on. I'm going back in.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.336
We're out of tea. I'll put a kettle on.

06:18.419 --> 06:19.378
Hurry up, Bunty.

06:19.462 --> 06:20.963
First, can I fluff your pillow?

06:21.047 --> 06:23.049
It's a bit damp from your sleep sweats.

06:23.132 --> 06:25.676
- Tea, go!
- Oh, my.

06:25.760 --> 06:26.803
When the revolution comes,

06:26.886 --> 06:29.222
we'll hang her
with our own intestines, we will.

06:33.226 --> 06:37.772
Oh, Derek and Bear Boy and Freckles,

06:37.855 --> 06:39.315
Daddy's here.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.235
Are you sleepin'? Huh?

06:42.318 --> 06:45.196
Well, wake up 'cause I wanna tuck you in

06:45.279 --> 06:49.242
and tell you some
of the scariest fairytales you ever heard.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.619
Hmm? Hmm.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.496
What the hell is this? A note?

06:53.579 --> 06:55.998
"Dear, Pops…" Aw!

06:56.082 --> 07:00.711
"Don't get mad but me and Bear Boy
and Freckles did something real bad

07:00.795 --> 07:04.298
and I can't tell you what it is,
but it involved killing a guy."

07:04.382 --> 07:07.885
"So we decided to run away,
and we're never coming back."

07:07.969 --> 07:10.138
"So, I guess this is goodbye forever."

07:10.680 --> 07:13.057
"Goodbye forever, Derek."

07:13.141 --> 07:15.393
"PS: Snarla says, 'Screw you,'

07:15.476 --> 07:18.396
and Freckles and Bear Boy
both say, 'So long, fatso.'"

07:18.479 --> 07:20.064
"So long, fatso"?

07:20.148 --> 07:22.859
Why you… Screw you!

07:22.942 --> 07:24.569
Why you little…

07:27.029 --> 07:28.948
Lookee here, they ran away.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.324
They didn't even leave a note.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.368
Well, they left the note, but still!

07:32.452 --> 07:35.288
All right, right now I'm dealing with
some pretty heavy dream stuff, Dad.

07:35.371 --> 07:37.165
They won't get away with this.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.875
I'll track 'em down. Yeah!

07:38.958 --> 07:40.376
Dad, I need your help.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.962
The elf still botherin' you?
We could always off him.

07:43.045 --> 07:45.131
- Oh, hi, Elfo.
- What?

07:45.214 --> 07:46.799
No, Dad, listen, okay?

07:46.883 --> 07:48.968
I've got a bad Bean inside my head

07:49.051 --> 07:51.429
and when I go to sleep,
she murders me for no reason.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.181
Welcome to Dreamland, baby.

07:53.264 --> 07:55.850
When you close your eyes,
anything can happen.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.727
Why don't we just run away?

07:57.810 --> 07:59.854
Like Derek? Nah, you can't run away.

07:59.937 --> 08:01.606
Someone always drags you back.

08:01.689 --> 08:03.649
- What a nightmare.
- Not always.

08:03.733 --> 08:07.945
I got a nice recurrent dream
about a little black kitty named Guci.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.530
He brings me cornbread.

08:09.614 --> 08:10.948
It sure does taste funny.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.909
But what about Bad Bean?

08:12.992 --> 08:15.745
Your very own doppelganger. Wow!

08:15.828 --> 08:17.455
My little girl's growing up.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.040
What should I do, Dad?

08:19.123 --> 08:22.043
More like what should
you shouldn't do, Bean?

08:22.126 --> 08:25.505
Just don't let your evil twin there
give you the old switcheroo.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.215
- What?
- Okay, bye.

08:27.298 --> 08:28.925
I'll be back in a day or two.

08:29.467 --> 08:30.384
Oh!

08:30.468 --> 08:33.304
Uh, just out
for my morning snoop.

08:33.387 --> 08:36.641
- Ah, just the schlump I wanted to see.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.394
We're going huntin', Odval.

08:40.478 --> 08:42.980
And what exactly are we hunting for,
Your Impulsiveness?

08:43.064 --> 08:45.107
My three sons of bitches.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.401
Oh, yes. That would explain the nets.

08:47.985 --> 08:48.903
- Hyah!

08:48.986 --> 08:50.154
Ooh!

08:56.577 --> 08:58.412
Oh, boy. A purloined wagon,

08:58.496 --> 09:02.041
a barrel of stolen cookies,
a flask I found in the street.

09:02.124 --> 09:05.044
We're well provisioned outlaws on the lam!

09:05.127 --> 09:08.089
Ah, I'm sick of starting new lives.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.715
This is twice in one week.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.468
We're going someplace
where we can have adventures,

09:12.552 --> 09:15.805
and bonding
and secret adolescent experiments.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.724
Well, I can't have no more adventures
in that Enchanted Forest, yeah?

09:18.808 --> 09:21.519
I'm wanted on five counts of everything.

09:21.602 --> 09:25.439
Say, fellas, I heard of a place
that's so exciting,

09:25.523 --> 09:27.358
we're all going to have heart attacks.

09:27.441 --> 09:29.694
- Excellent!
- I'd like to have a heart attack.

09:29.777 --> 09:31.946
Let's head north, you dopes. Hyah!

09:32.029 --> 09:33.447
Ow!

09:38.536 --> 09:40.204
Sir, look at the sign.

09:40.288 --> 09:41.706
The elves are up to something.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.207
How do you figure?

09:46.669 --> 09:48.379
Pipe down, you numbnuts.

09:48.462 --> 09:53.009
Welcome to the first meeting of
the Elf-Trøg Neighborhood Association.

09:53.092 --> 09:57.930
I'd like to introduce
our head of Elf Intelligence, Braino.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.683
- Here's what we don't know so far.

10:00.766 --> 10:04.228
We don't know if the humans
know much about our history.

10:04.312 --> 10:08.357
Because, of course, we ourselves
don't know much about our history.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.402
Only that the answer
might lie below the castle

10:11.485 --> 10:15.031
where some kind of crazy hoo-ha
took place long ago.

10:15.114 --> 10:18.784
Possibly over a screwier mystery
even deeper underground.

10:19.368 --> 10:22.079
The depth of our ignorance
is something we also don't know.

10:22.830 --> 10:23.914
Possibly bottomless.

10:24.915 --> 10:25.750
Thank you.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.169
Ah, this is a waste of time.

10:28.252 --> 10:29.879
They know even less than I do.

10:29.962 --> 10:32.381
- And you're an ignoranus.
- Why, you…

10:32.923 --> 10:34.508
Uh, thank you, Braino.

10:34.592 --> 10:37.428
- How much do we pay you?
- You don't want to know.

10:37.511 --> 10:41.724
Now on to what we do want to know, Hencho…

10:41.807 --> 10:45.895
For centuries we Trøgs have
protected the secret goo.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.356
But Tiabeanie has been given a taste.

10:48.439 --> 10:49.940
Then we took it away.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.859
She'll have to come to us for more.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.152
Thank you, Enablo.

10:53.235 --> 10:57.448
For it is only with this goo
that she can defeat our most feared enemy.

10:57.531 --> 11:00.660
You mean that escaped circus ostrich
who put his head down the hole?

11:00.743 --> 11:03.079
- No.
- You mean doors with high knobs?

11:03.162 --> 11:04.372
Yes, but no.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.540
I mean Dagmar.

11:11.545 --> 11:14.548
Odval, why does everything
I love run away?

11:14.632 --> 11:17.134
Perhaps you don't chain them up
tight enough, sire.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.642
Ready or not, here I come.

11:24.725 --> 11:27.061
Wait. No, it's too risky.

11:27.144 --> 11:29.647
- Why can't you just get a lobotomy?

11:36.904 --> 11:38.864
What, are you gonna chop off
my head this time?

11:38.948 --> 11:40.408
No, not this time.

11:40.491 --> 11:43.577
Also, your hair's messed up.
You slept on it funny.

11:43.661 --> 11:46.664
Look, I've just been trying to get
to know you one on one.

11:46.747 --> 11:49.417
Being inside your head all this time
was really crazy making.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.709
Yeah, tell me about it.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.378
Come on, let's team up.

11:52.461 --> 11:53.671
Team Bean!

11:53.754 --> 11:56.465
I mean, it rhymes.
Together, we can beat the curse.

11:56.549 --> 12:00.177
"Team Bean" doesn't rhyme,
and how do I know you won't kill me?

12:00.261 --> 12:02.096
You know what, Bean,
I'm sorry I insulted you

12:02.179 --> 12:03.889
'cause your hair looks like a haystack.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.850
But I'm not gonna kill you.

12:05.933 --> 12:08.018
If you're gone, I don't exist.

12:08.102 --> 12:09.979
All right, then give me the sword.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.647
- Don't throw it.
- There you go.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.983
Now, let's take a little stroll, shall we?

12:15.067 --> 12:16.360
Hmm?

12:20.239 --> 12:22.742
Yoo-hoo! Sleepin' suckers.

12:22.825 --> 12:23.784
Wake up!

12:27.037 --> 12:29.540
Welcome to Steamland,
you douchebags.

12:29.623 --> 12:31.417
Wow!

12:31.500 --> 12:36.547
Behold the city of lights and taffy
and budget massage parlors.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.799
I've never seen so many phallic objects.

12:38.883 --> 12:39.717
Ooh!

12:46.223 --> 12:48.684
You were so right
to let me make you go all paranoid.

12:48.767 --> 12:51.520
I knew it. I told people
I was being controlled by unseen forces

12:51.604 --> 12:54.398
putting thoughts into my head,
and nobody believed me.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.776
Lots of people would like
to take over this castle.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.278
Some are within these walls,
some are Odval.

12:59.361 --> 13:00.988
The rest are out here.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.119
Oh, no.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.539
Welcome to Dreamland, Doomsday edition.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.624
Is this real?

13:11.707 --> 13:13.793
It will be
if you don't do something about it.

13:13.876 --> 13:16.337
I already have Elfo and Luci
to help me with that.

13:16.420 --> 13:19.799
Those two couldn't fight Vip and Vap
out of a wet paper booze bag.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.634
How come you know so much and I don't?

13:21.717 --> 13:24.220
Unlike you, I suppress nothing.

13:24.303 --> 13:29.433
I make to-do lists, I exercise,
I meditate, and I put it all together.

13:29.517 --> 13:32.770
I'm the repository of everything
you've ever seen or heard

13:32.853 --> 13:34.230
since the day you were born.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.607
So naturally, I'm way smarter.

13:36.690 --> 13:40.528
Well, at least I don't live in a stupid
person's head… Checkers.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.822
I think you mean, "Checkmate," dumbass.

13:42.905 --> 13:46.116
Look, Bean, I brung you here
because you need to be ready,

13:46.200 --> 13:48.619
and that means unleashing
your secret power.

13:48.702 --> 13:50.538
But what's my secret power?

13:50.621 --> 13:54.375
Um, maybe the thing where giant sparks
shoot out of your hands?

13:54.458 --> 13:56.836
But I don't even know what I'm doing.

13:56.919 --> 13:59.171
And it doesn't work,
it just happens sometimes.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.507
It never "just happens," okay?

14:01.590 --> 14:02.925
Let me show you something.

14:03.801 --> 14:05.636
Okay, aim for the seagull up there.

14:05.719 --> 14:06.887
No way.

14:10.432 --> 14:12.268
Bonus points for Dad's fat head.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.478
Whoa! How did you make me do that?

14:14.562 --> 14:16.981
Just fill your heart with hate. Super fun.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.984
Let's see… What makes you angry?

14:20.067 --> 14:21.068
I don't know.

14:21.151 --> 14:25.990
Guys who try to marry me, weak drinks,
people who tell me their problems.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.366
Yeah, go on.

14:27.449 --> 14:29.785
Loud chewing, walking behind slowpokes…

14:29.868 --> 14:32.621
Lousy Dreamland Ditchweed, squirrel jokes!

14:32.705 --> 14:35.124
Come on. What really pisses you off?

14:35.207 --> 14:38.210
Damp towels, Bunty's radical blatherings.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.338
Oh, man! Chocolate chip cookies that
turn out to be oatmeal raisin cookies.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.257
Oh, being told, "Calm down, Bean."

14:43.340 --> 14:45.551
I will not calm down
because I'm already calm!

14:45.634 --> 14:48.596
Mom and her tacky
thigh-high stiletto boots.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.890
What about everyone who hurt you,

14:50.973 --> 14:52.016
- who betrayed you…

14:52.099 --> 14:54.393
…who laughed at you
when you made your address?

14:54.476 --> 14:56.729
- Yeah.
- Don't forget about the damn patriarchy!

14:56.812 --> 14:57.980
The whole system's rigged!

14:58.063 --> 15:00.024
And it should be burned to the ground.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.191
Blast the castle.

15:05.529 --> 15:08.365
We're sick of being responsible
for you dopes.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.867
And not just Turbish.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.119
We'd be free if all of you were dead.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.039
Oh, my God. You want to destroy Dreamland.

15:15.122 --> 15:18.000
Great. The slow thinker has an epiphany.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.919
I think I know what that means.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.503
If you weren't drunk all the time,

15:21.587 --> 15:23.380
I'd have gotten you
to do what I wanted by now.

15:23.464 --> 15:24.798
That's why I brang you here,

15:24.882 --> 15:27.217
'cause you're too stupid
to do anything on your own.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.844
You sound just like Mom.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.846
Dagmar needs you, I don't.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.598
But you said we were the "Bean Team."

15:32.681 --> 15:35.517
I lied. I lie all the time.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.853
Oh, guess what? I'm lying right now.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.273
Truth is, I'm a fully functioning
consciousness, Bean.

15:41.357 --> 15:44.276
All I need to do
is kill the part of us I don't like.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.153
And then I can occupy your body

15:46.236 --> 15:49.031
without all these petty things
that hold us back

15:49.114 --> 15:53.327
like love and friendship,
and the desire to bathe.

15:53.410 --> 15:55.704
Wow, my brain's hardcore.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.378
You punch like an inner child.

16:02.461 --> 16:03.671
Internalize this.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.422
Ow! God damn it.

16:08.801 --> 16:12.388
Face it, you always knew
you were going to die this way…

16:12.471 --> 16:15.766
Alone, unarmed,

16:16.392 --> 16:19.311
and un-loved.

16:19.978 --> 16:22.314
There's no love for you.

16:26.568 --> 16:28.487
Ow!

16:28.570 --> 16:29.405
Thank you.

16:29.947 --> 16:30.948
Buh-bye.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.450
Um… What?

16:34.535 --> 16:36.829
- I was not just smelling your neck.

16:36.912 --> 16:37.746
It worked.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.415
Get away from me, you little freak.

16:39.498 --> 16:42.084
I mean, give me a hug, Elfo.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.503
Really? Are you high?

16:44.586 --> 16:46.088
Mmm.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.840
Easy there, big fella.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.091
Okay, enough.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.718
Are you okay, Bean?

16:50.801 --> 16:53.262
- Was Bad Bean devious?
- Yeah, of course she was.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.389
- Did she try to manipulate you?
- Yes.

16:55.472 --> 16:58.434
- But you defeated her, right?
- No more questions, peewee.

16:58.517 --> 16:59.685
I mean, cool dude.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.520
Aw!

17:01.603 --> 17:02.646
Hmm…

17:03.439 --> 17:06.066
Oh, no, I gotta get out of this dream.

17:10.612 --> 17:12.781
Wake up, me. Wake up!

17:15.576 --> 17:16.577
What?

17:17.578 --> 17:19.872
Guys! Hey, guys, it's me.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.498
I'm stuck in this dream.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.959
Come on. I'm over here.
Look at me. Come here.

17:26.086 --> 17:27.629
I'm in control now.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.339
All we have to do is wait.

17:31.383 --> 17:32.885
What are you looking at, Bean?

17:33.969 --> 17:36.847
No, that's Bad Bean.
She's pretending to be me.

17:36.930 --> 17:40.309
Look, now she's imitating me
so you think I'm her reflection.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.020
What are you doing?

17:43.103 --> 17:45.230
I'm tired of this mirror. It irritates me.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.232
I'm afraid it's not the mirror, Bean.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.693
Look, we all struggle with body issues.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.654
I've tried pounding on the mirror, too,
but it's no use.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.864
I'm still a seven.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.491
Please, I need a moment.

17:55.574 --> 17:56.450
Everybody out.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.452
I'll meet you in the hall. Now!

17:58.535 --> 18:01.371
I just need a moment
to wipe away your royal dream drool.

18:01.455 --> 18:02.790
Scram, Bunty!

18:02.873 --> 18:04.416
Yikes! What a grouch.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.502
- That's right. You heard me.
- Out.

18:08.462 --> 18:09.630
Bye-bye, Beanie.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.135
What the hell, Elfo. Are you spying on me?

18:15.219 --> 18:17.513
Please. I do not spy.

18:17.596 --> 18:20.057
- I peep.
- I'll be back for you and Luci, later.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.642
Right now, out of my way.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.435
The corridors are quite wide, ma'am.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.271
There's no need for shovin'
or bein' a regal jerk fest.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.148
Shush.

18:35.322 --> 18:36.532
- Ow!

18:43.872 --> 18:45.332
My appendage.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.671
Well, what do you know!

18:50.754 --> 18:53.090
- Look, a visitors center.
- Wow.

18:53.173 --> 18:56.009
The perfect place for inquiring noobs
like you.

18:56.093 --> 18:58.303
Plus, I got to make some woodchips, bad.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.305
What kind
of tourist kiosk is this?

19:00.389 --> 19:01.932
All I smell is urine.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.852
Oh…

19:08.772 --> 19:11.775
As promised, four fabulous freaks.

19:11.859 --> 19:14.069
Each one more unusual than the last.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.071
No matter what order you look at 'em.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.322
Thank you, Freckles.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.199
Shut up. I'm counting over here.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.539
Well, nice doin' business with you.

19:25.622 --> 19:26.665
- Say, Freckles…
- Eh?

19:26.748 --> 19:30.377
I didn't realize you're a, uh…
What exactly are you?

19:30.460 --> 19:33.922
I'm a magical dancin' puppet boy
brought to life.

19:34.006 --> 19:34.923
Uh-oh.

19:35.507 --> 19:38.010
- Hey, what the hell?
- It's just a burlap sack.

19:38.093 --> 19:39.011
Get in there.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.305
I'll kill you, you rat bastard.

19:41.388 --> 19:43.515
That moustache is better on your mother.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.893
Hold it right there, pal.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.520
And who in blazes might you be?

19:48.604 --> 19:50.355
My name is King Zøg.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.441
And I'm here to take my kids home.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.443
You know, our fat man just died

19:54.526 --> 19:56.945
and you, my friend,
could be his replacement.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.573
How many hot dogs
can you eat in a half hour? Be honest.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.033
I don't know, about 45?

20:01.116 --> 20:03.202
Why you…

20:04.411 --> 20:06.830
Okay, then. Well, I guess it's up to me.

20:08.081 --> 20:11.043
Yowza, my friend. I like what I see.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.671
Yes, well, hmm, okay. Oh, all right.
Well, here we go.

20:16.173 --> 20:19.343
And here comes the fist. Oh!

20:19.426 --> 20:21.595
Let me outta here, you jerk.

20:22.679 --> 20:26.558
You son of a bitch!
Your mustache smells like yoghurt.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.612
Calling Hell.

20:38.695 --> 20:39.613
Come in, Hell.

20:39.696 --> 20:40.572
Yikes.

20:51.959 --> 20:52.960
I'm suffocating.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.587
Aha!

20:59.800 --> 21:01.843
Bean, where are you?

21:02.386 --> 21:05.305
Elfo, you nimwit. That wasn't Bean,
that was Bad Bean.

21:05.389 --> 21:07.724
And normally,
I do like the sound of bad anything,

21:07.808 --> 21:10.185
but regular Bean is bad
enough for me. Mmmkay?

21:10.269 --> 21:11.478
Well, look in the mirror.

21:11.561 --> 21:14.940
There's a weeping Bean in there,
and she don't look too damn happy.

21:15.524 --> 21:18.902
The old switcheroo. Here, on page 202.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.405
Luci, you have to invade Bean's dream.

21:21.488 --> 21:24.116
Mmm, damn it. I'm not so good at this.
Let me think.

21:24.199 --> 21:28.996
"A personal demon can usually pass
his malice through the looking glass."

21:29.079 --> 21:30.789
Luci, that's you!

21:30.872 --> 21:32.541
Yeah, but read between the lines.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.794
It says, "usually." If it don't work,
we're both stuck in there.

21:35.877 --> 21:37.421
Look, I'm not immortal anymore.

21:37.504 --> 21:39.840
I'm just a glorified bat
with a big fat nose.

21:39.923 --> 21:41.550
When I die, I go back to Hell.

21:41.633 --> 21:44.094
Or worse. Do you have any idea
what it'd be like to be stuck

21:44.177 --> 21:45.429
in Bean's head forever?

21:45.512 --> 21:48.098
The constant whiny self-doubts alone.

21:48.181 --> 21:49.891
I mean, oy vey.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.561
Luci, do it. Do it! Do it!

21:52.644 --> 21:56.314
I knew that catchphrase
would come back and bite me in the ass.

21:56.398 --> 21:59.776
Okay, I'll try, but no guarantees.

21:59.860 --> 22:00.944
And no laughing.

22:05.323 --> 22:06.575
Good try, Luci.

22:06.658 --> 22:07.743
Good try.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.369
Now, go!

22:11.830 --> 22:14.499
- Did I make it?
- Almost. It was so close.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.877
All right, third time's the charm.

22:16.960 --> 22:17.794
I'm not ready.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.422
Please, Luci, do it for our love of Bean.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.966
Love? But who loves Luci?

22:23.467 --> 22:26.136
One and a two and a…

22:30.640 --> 22:31.933
Whoa!

22:35.687 --> 22:37.272
- Is that you, Luci?
- Heh.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.441
Told you I'd enter your dreams
as a laughing skull.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.026
Knock it off.

22:41.109 --> 22:42.486
Look, bar's closed, okay?

22:42.569 --> 22:44.529
You don't got to go home,
but you can't stay here.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.156
- But I want to go home.
- Okay.

22:46.239 --> 22:47.783
So hold on tight and don't let go.

22:47.866 --> 22:51.078
When I give you the signal,
run at that mirror like an idiot, like me.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.996
No, like Elfo.

22:53.080 --> 22:53.914
Now.

22:53.997 --> 22:55.207
- Oh!

22:55.290 --> 22:57.125
- Voila!
- Whoa!

22:57.209 --> 22:59.044
Bean, you made it!

22:59.544 --> 23:01.088
Wait, what happened to Luci?

23:01.171 --> 23:02.422
Ooh, squished.

23:02.506 --> 23:04.091
Oh, Luci, I love you.

23:04.174 --> 23:05.550
Ah, no, you don't.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.177
Come on. Yeesh.

23:07.677 --> 23:08.929
I didn't say stop.

23:11.014 --> 23:12.390
God, that feels good.

23:12.474 --> 23:13.600
Mmm!

23:15.852 --> 23:17.604
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.

23:17.687 --> 23:20.899
See my latest freaks. Just arrived today.

23:20.982 --> 23:23.318
Gaze on their listless expressions.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.612
Wonder at their tear-filled eyes.

23:25.695 --> 23:28.156
Sure, they look depressed,
but don't be fooled.

23:28.240 --> 23:32.244
These oddities have no feelings
beyond simple savage bloodlust.

23:33.161 --> 23:34.538
Isn't that right, Petey?

23:34.621 --> 23:35.872
Screw you, Dad.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.791
I can't believe you married my nanny.

23:37.874 --> 23:40.210
There's Derek, the big blue newt.

23:40.293 --> 23:42.421
I'm a salamander, you moron.

23:42.504 --> 23:46.550
Bear Boy, the bear cub who sobs
like a little boy.

23:46.633 --> 23:47.676
I'll kill you.

23:47.759 --> 23:52.055
Snarla, the petite, punky pixie
who probably has rabies.

23:52.139 --> 23:54.266
It's pronounced scabies,
you stupid wanker.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.851
Racist Antelope.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.854
The only libertarian blowhard
in the freak show.

23:58.937 --> 24:02.399
Odval, hit his third eye and win a prize.

24:02.482 --> 24:03.316
Please don't.

24:03.400 --> 24:06.069
Gaze upon the bare-naked bear lady.

24:07.362 --> 24:08.697
And finally, Freckles.

24:08.780 --> 24:11.950
A happy little stooge
who love show business.

24:12.993 --> 24:14.786
What are you looking at, dummy?

24:14.870 --> 24:16.955
Well, shucks. I ain't no dummy.

24:17.038 --> 24:18.165
You're the dummy.

24:20.458 --> 24:23.670
Ah, jeez! Shoot him! Shoot him already.

24:29.092 --> 24:30.886
Wait a second. We're unarmed.

24:31.428 --> 24:33.680
Unarmed? How dumb can you be?

24:33.763 --> 24:34.973
Not dumb enough.

24:52.991 --> 24:54.659
I like that song a lot.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.077
That was kind of my jam.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.082
Elfo, throw me the sword.

25:01.166 --> 25:02.876
Are you the good Bean or the bad Bean?

25:02.959 --> 25:04.294
No, Elfo, throw it to me.

25:04.377 --> 25:05.504
I'll make it up to you.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.547
Come on! Don't fall for that.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.717
- Who do you guys think?
- Her.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.385
- No, her!
- No, her!

25:12.469 --> 25:14.721
Are you sure?
You're pointing at different Beans.

25:14.804 --> 25:15.972
It's definitely her.

25:16.056 --> 25:17.641
Uh, you know what? I change my mind.

25:17.724 --> 25:19.059
Come on, Elfo.

25:19.142 --> 25:20.894
Don't listen to her, Elfo.

25:20.977 --> 25:24.564
Okay, answer me this question
and don't talk at the same time.

25:24.648 --> 25:25.524
You first.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.652
- Do you love me, Bean?
- We've been through this before.

25:28.735 --> 25:30.070
How does this solve anything?

25:30.153 --> 25:31.446
That your final answer?

25:31.530 --> 25:33.740
Yes, Elfo. I love and respect you.

25:33.823 --> 25:34.741
Oh.

25:34.824 --> 25:36.701
Love and respect… heh.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.078
Right in the heart.

25:38.161 --> 25:40.622
Okay, Bean number two. Same question.

25:40.705 --> 25:41.665
Do you love me?

25:41.748 --> 25:42.791
Oh, Elfo.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.417
Of course, I love you.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.296
Aw, I love you too, Bean.

25:50.090 --> 25:52.300
- God damn, Elfo! You tryin' to kill me?
- Hmm.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.760
You tried to get me mad.

25:53.843 --> 25:56.054
Well now, I'm really mad.

25:58.473 --> 26:01.017
It doesn't matter what you do now.

26:01.101 --> 26:02.644
The guests are almost here.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.855
It's over.
If only you had your muffins, huh?

26:07.232 --> 26:08.066
Face it.

26:08.149 --> 26:11.069
You can't kill me, Bean.
You know you love me.

26:11.152 --> 26:12.821
I don't even love myself.

26:18.618 --> 26:19.494
Wow.

26:19.578 --> 26:20.912
Just wow.

26:24.332 --> 26:25.792
Every single time.

26:25.875 --> 26:28.003
Quick, clean up the blood,
wipe off the sword.

26:28.086 --> 26:29.045
Hide the body.

26:39.347 --> 26:40.348
Crown.

26:50.525 --> 26:54.279
You, uh…
You are the good Bean, right?

26:54.362 --> 26:56.448
Not now, Elfo. Get out of here.

26:56.531 --> 26:57.616
- Wait…

26:58.742 --> 26:59.659
Thank you.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.501
Hmm.

27:13.757 --> 27:16.468
Oh, darling.
We came as soon as you called.

27:16.551 --> 27:18.178
Yeah, that was fast.

27:18.261 --> 27:20.180
Well, congratulations are in order.

27:20.263 --> 27:22.015
You vanquished the problem child,

27:22.098 --> 27:24.893
and now look at you… Magnificent.

27:24.976 --> 27:25.894
Thank you.

27:25.977 --> 27:28.188
Oh, you're going to make your mother cry.

27:28.271 --> 27:31.566
You can put your hand down now, Bean.
You're not a statue for crying out loud.

27:34.527 --> 27:36.029
How you been, Mom?

27:36.112 --> 27:38.365
Can I make you a drink?
What's your poison?

27:38.448 --> 27:40.367
That was a bad choice of words.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.243
- What the hell is going on?

27:42.327 --> 27:43.161
What's the holdup?

27:43.244 --> 27:45.538
Just dealing with the luggage, dear.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.624
Well, well, well.

27:47.707 --> 27:49.167
The one that got away.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.169
Hello again, Tiabeanie.

27:51.252 --> 27:53.046
Hi, Satan.

27:53.129 --> 27:55.006
Are you growing out your horns?
You look good.

27:55.090 --> 27:56.591
- Straighten up, dear.
- Hmm?

27:56.675 --> 27:57.926
Both of you.

27:59.469 --> 28:01.429
What? No hug?

28:03.807 --> 28:06.768
Bean, I don't think
I can last eternity with your mother.

28:06.851 --> 28:09.145
- You know I don't like whispering.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.398
What the hell is going on with your crown?

28:11.981 --> 28:13.566
Those head screws were very expensive.

28:14.150 --> 28:15.360
You're the wrong Bean.

28:20.865 --> 28:21.991
Whoa!

28:22.075 --> 28:23.284
Oh…

28:36.715 --> 28:38.341
- You killed her?
- Who cares?

28:38.925 --> 28:40.260
I can work with this.
