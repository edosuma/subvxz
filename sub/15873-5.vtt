00:01.458 --> 00:04.208
[Emma]  A few months ago
I discovered I had
a twin sister

00:04.208 --> 00:06.417
and then she asked me
to take her place.

00:06.417 --> 00:11.000
Keep the secret,
find our real mother
and try to stay alive.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.417
Put yourself in my shoes.

00:13.417 --> 00:16.041
How long could you keep up
the lying game?

00:16.041 --> 00:18.041
The desk clerk said
that when you were here.

00:18.041 --> 00:21.291
-Annie wasn't the
only person with you.
-Did he now?

00:21.291 --> 00:23.042
You're...
You're screwing
with my head.

00:23.042 --> 00:25.208
What kind of man would
that make me? Come here.

00:25.208 --> 00:27.959
When you take that
stage tell everybody

00:27.959 --> 00:30.625
that Dr. Ted Mercer
is your biological father.

00:30.625 --> 00:34.125
Something you don't know
about Ted Mercer is...

00:34.125 --> 00:36.000
That the smartest thing
he has ever done

00:36.000 --> 00:38.333
was to marry my mom,
Kristin Mercer.

00:38.333 --> 00:39.667
[Ethan]  You were
real up there.

00:39.667 --> 00:42.209
That was the Sutton Mercer
from the ranch that night.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.041
Listen, Emma,
did you come here
because you want my help

00:44.041 --> 00:45.208
or because you want me?

00:45.208 --> 00:47.083
Both.

00:47.083 --> 00:48.500
-Who are you talking to?
-Sutton.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.542
[Emma] Oh, great. Love you.

00:52.625 --> 00:54.291
[Laurel] Sutton?

00:54.291 --> 00:56.917
-What is this?
-It's a journal
by Kristin Mercer.

00:56.917 --> 00:59.667
This wonderful mother
wanted to give you away.

01:02.125 --> 01:03.625
[Sutton] "I'm not
a good mother,

01:03.625 --> 01:06.959
"I have all this
insecurity and doubt.

01:06.959 --> 01:11.333
"Ted forced me
into this adoption,
and I wasn't ready.

01:11.333 --> 01:12.875
"If I could do it over again,

01:12.875 --> 01:15.333
"I would never have
gone through with it.

01:15.333 --> 01:17.209
"Sometimes...

01:19.834 --> 01:23.417
"Sometimes I wish I could
just give Sutton back."

01:26.125 --> 01:28.083
Where did you get this?

01:28.083 --> 01:31.250
I found it
when I was looking for you.

01:31.250 --> 01:35.041
All these years,
I was convinced that
I'd given you and Emma

01:35.041 --> 01:37.000
a better life
by putting you up
for adoption.

01:38.125 --> 01:39.959
Why would you show this to me?

01:39.959 --> 01:43.167
I didn't show it to you
to hurt you, Sutton.

01:43.167 --> 01:45.333
You deserve to know the truth,

01:45.333 --> 01:48.500
that Kristin is not the mother
you think she is.

Hey.

02:24.959 --> 02:27.084
Oh, God, coffee.

02:27.084 --> 02:28.250
Thank you.

02:28.250 --> 02:30.333
Sorry for passing out
like that.

02:30.333 --> 02:32.167
I didn't really sleep
too well last night.

02:32.167 --> 02:33.250
That's okay.

02:33.250 --> 02:35.208
It gave me some time to listen
to your messages again.

02:35.208 --> 02:38.000
-Hey, I thought
you deleted them.
-[chuckles]

02:38.000 --> 02:40.834
Well, even though
I didn't call you back,
I was still listening.

02:42.834 --> 02:46.209
Thayer, when I saw you
at the bus station,

02:46.209 --> 02:50.750
it was the happiest
I had been in a while.

02:50.750 --> 02:52.500
[chuckles]

02:52.500 --> 02:54.542
I can't imagine going through
all this without you.

02:55.583 --> 02:57.000
You don't have to.

03:04.125 --> 03:05.458
Hey, I think you're right

03:05.458 --> 03:07.542
about everything
being connected.

03:07.542 --> 03:10.000
I think the woman at the motel
could be your birth mother.

03:11.041 --> 03:12.500
My birth mother?

03:12.500 --> 03:14.417
She wants her identity
to stay hidden.

03:14.417 --> 03:16.084
That's why Sutton lied
to protect her.

03:16.084 --> 03:17.875
But that means
that Sutton knows who she is

03:17.875 --> 03:19.166
and why wouldn't
she just tell me?

03:19.166 --> 03:21.500
My dad said not to trust her.

03:21.500 --> 03:24.000
She must have found
something in her search,
kept it from both of us.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.375
Okay, well, then we'll just
do a search of our own.

03:26.375 --> 03:27.625
Okay.

03:27.625 --> 03:29.375
Maybe we can go
to the hospital

03:29.375 --> 03:32.084
where I was born
and see if there are any women

03:32.084 --> 03:33.750
who gave birth to twins
the same day Annie did.

03:33.750 --> 03:35.792
-Sounds like a plan.
-Great.

03:37.125 --> 03:38.708
Oh!

03:39.417 --> 03:41.208
You had a day planned for us.

03:42.125 --> 03:44.084
-I had a few ideas.
-[Sutton] Aw.

03:44.084 --> 03:45.583
Temescal Canyon,

03:45.583 --> 03:47.208
the Hollywood sign. [chuckles]

03:47.208 --> 03:49.750
Uh, this really good coffee
shop off of La Cienega.

03:50.750 --> 03:53.708
Okay, can we do all that
after the hospital?

03:53.708 --> 03:55.083
-That's fine.
-Okay.

03:55.083 --> 03:56.417
Let's go.

03:59.083 --> 04:00.750
Gonna be around later?

04:00.750 --> 04:02.708
I was thinking
about firing up the grill,
cooking some steaks.

04:02.708 --> 04:05.166
You know, be a man.

04:05.166 --> 04:06.500
If you were really a man,

04:06.500 --> 04:08.542
you would take out the trash
instead of making me do it.

04:08.542 --> 04:10.000
You gotta earn your
keep somehow, woman.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.375
Mmm. Love you.

04:12.375 --> 04:13.959
I'll see you tonight
for dinner.

04:13.959 --> 04:15.125
Okay.

04:18.166 --> 04:20.625
You know, that's, like,
the ninth day in a row
she's slept here, right?

04:20.625 --> 04:23.167
Got a lot of time
to make up for, man.

04:23.167 --> 04:25.542
-[engine starts]
-She does have her own place.

04:25.542 --> 04:27.041
You guys ever think
about staying over there?

04:27.041 --> 04:28.834
You know, it sounds
suspiciously like

04:28.834 --> 04:30.125
you're trying
to get rid of me.

04:30.125 --> 04:33.458
Yeah, you caught me.
I'm gonna throw a rager
here in between

04:33.458 --> 04:35.625
all my chem proofs
and geometry equations.

04:35.625 --> 04:37.875
Oh, yeah, how is that
tutoring going?

04:37.875 --> 04:39.333
You and Sutton back on track?

04:41.125 --> 04:43.250
Um, I guess
you could say that.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.042
I just don't know what track.

04:45.042 --> 04:46.208
Right.

04:47.166 --> 04:48.500
You must be doing
something right

04:48.500 --> 04:49.583
if you're here
instead of juvie.

04:50.667 --> 04:52.084
Cheers.

04:58.875 --> 05:00.875
-Hey.
-Hey.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.125
I'll show you
what's under mine

05:03.125 --> 05:04.458
if you show me
what's under yours.

05:04.458 --> 05:05.542
Pass.

05:05.542 --> 05:07.375
-Come on.
-Mmm-mmm.

05:09.708 --> 05:11.166
[gasps]

05:12.291 --> 05:15.166
What? I had a morning swim.

05:15.166 --> 05:17.000
Got to get your mind
out of the gutter.

05:25.375 --> 05:27.041
[Rebecca] Hey.

05:27.041 --> 05:29.000
I'm going
to the grocery store.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.625
I'm thinking risotto,
tomato salad for
dinner tonight.

05:31.625 --> 05:33.084
I'm thinking
that sounds perfect.

05:33.084 --> 05:34.375
Great. Okay.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.458
Oh, one more thing.

05:36.458 --> 05:39.083
I'm really glad
that Mads decided to move in.

05:39.083 --> 05:41.209
It feels like
everything's going
in the right direction...

05:41.583 --> 05:43.041
For all of us.

05:43.041 --> 05:44.917
I couldn't have planned it
better myself.

05:45.041 --> 05:46.500
Hmm.

05:50.208 --> 05:52.084
[Laurel] Who's all this for?

05:52.084 --> 05:54.166
Well, I thought we could
have one last breakfast,

05:54.166 --> 05:56.834
just the girls,
before Mads moves out.

05:56.834 --> 06:00.792
Mads already left
for Rebecca's and
Sutton's at tennis.

06:02.083 --> 06:03.250
Looks like it's just us.

06:05.084 --> 06:07.458
I thought you gave
a beautiful speech
about your father.

06:07.458 --> 06:09.166
Okay, hold on.
Are you gonna make me cry?

06:09.166 --> 06:11.041
'Cause I just put on mascara.

06:11.041 --> 06:14.041
No crying.
I'm just a very proud mama.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.917
Sutton was
pretty surprising
last night, huh?

06:18.166 --> 06:21.000
I wasn't expecting her
to be so nice,

06:21.000 --> 06:23.084
not after the way
she reacted in therapy.

06:23.084 --> 06:26.000
I think your sister
is doing the best she can.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.583
I mean, it isn't easy.

06:27.583 --> 06:29.125
But it was like night and day.

06:29.125 --> 06:31.125
Haven't, haven't you
noticed that lately?

06:31.125 --> 06:33.750
She says one thing and then
does the complete opposite.

06:33.750 --> 06:38.041
I haven't. But honestly,
my mind is in 1,000 places.

06:38.041 --> 06:40.417
I mean, you think
it's something I should
be worried about?

06:40.417 --> 06:42.041
It's probably just me
overthinking.

06:42.041 --> 06:44.083
I'll figure it out.
Don't worry about it.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.291
You know, you should
give yourself more credit.

06:49.291 --> 06:52.583
The way you've dealt with
everything that's happened.

06:52.583 --> 06:54.458
I know you're
a proud mom but...

06:55.500 --> 06:57.042
I'm a prouder daughter.

07:01.667 --> 07:04.500
-[bell rings]
-Just read it.
It explains everything.

07:04.500 --> 07:07.084
Why I always felt
like Kristin was smothering me

07:07.084 --> 07:09.041
and overcompensating.

07:09.041 --> 07:10.875
It's like she was
forcing herself to love me.

07:10.875 --> 07:13.875
Stop, stop.
What if this thing's a fake?

07:13.875 --> 07:16.792
What, someone
who wasn't Kristin
filled an entire journal

07:16.792 --> 07:18.708
with Kristin's
innermost thoughts?

07:18.708 --> 07:20.209
Well, there's got to be
an explanation.

07:20.209 --> 07:21.917
Yeah, she's a liar.

07:21.917 --> 07:23.750
She has an entry in there
about how she wasn't sure

07:23.750 --> 07:25.625
she wanted to be a wife
or a mother.

07:25.625 --> 07:28.000
What if she still
feels that way?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.875
Look, what you
said at the banquet
about Kristin,

07:30.875 --> 07:33.458
that's who she really is.
You know that.

07:33.458 --> 07:35.333
I have
a family dinner tonight.

07:35.333 --> 07:38.167
The first one in a long time.

07:38.167 --> 07:39.500
I don't know
how I'm gonna face her.

07:40.125 --> 07:41.208
Sutton...

07:41.208 --> 07:43.542
You're stuck on a version
of Kristin from the past,

07:43.542 --> 07:45.083
someone you never even knew.

07:45.083 --> 07:46.583
Let it go.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.959
[Emma] I can't believe
we're breaking into
hospital records.

07:56.959 --> 07:59.417
That nurse we snuck by
will be back any second.

07:59.417 --> 08:01.125
[keyboard clacking]

08:03.209 --> 08:04.583
Hurry, hurry.

08:04.583 --> 08:05.959
[Thayer] I've got a name.

08:05.959 --> 08:08.041
Dr. Thomas Benson.

08:08.041 --> 08:10.959
He delivered every baby
the day you were born.

08:10.959 --> 08:13.291
-And he still works here.
-Let's go.

08:15.917 --> 08:18.042
Who are you?
Where's Brenda?

08:19.583 --> 08:21.250
I am so glad to find you.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.125
Oh, we've been looking
everywhere for somebody.

08:23.125 --> 08:24.209
I have these chest pains

08:24.209 --> 08:25.208
and I'm not sure
what they are.

08:25.208 --> 08:27.458
I feel like I'm a little young
to be having chest pains.

08:27.458 --> 08:30.000
[inhales] And I keep
trying to breathe in
and I just can't.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.166
I'm having a hard time.

08:31.166 --> 08:33.209
Well, come on,
why don't you go
get some water,

08:33.209 --> 08:36.167
settle down
and wait in the ER,
like everybody else?

08:36.167 --> 08:37.500
Okay.

08:40.834 --> 08:42.291
[indistinct chatter]

08:46.209 --> 08:47.291
Creep much?

08:47.291 --> 08:51.959
So I was thinking,
and it doesn't really
make any sense.

08:51.959 --> 08:54.166
I was talking to Sutton
on your phone

08:54.166 --> 08:57.542
and then two seconds later,
I saw her in the kitchen...

08:57.542 --> 08:59.000
Not on the phone.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.750
Yeah, Sutton hung up.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.458
But why were you
talking on the phone?

09:04.458 --> 09:06.333
I mean,
if she was in the house?

09:06.333 --> 09:08.542
Look, Laurel, I'm already
having a really weird day,

09:08.542 --> 09:10.125
what with
moving into Rebecca's,

09:10.125 --> 09:11.708
and the last thing I need

09:11.708 --> 09:13.084
is you going all
Nancy Drew on me.

09:13.708 --> 09:16.625
[bell rings]

09:16.625 --> 09:18.917
Oh, hey. I'm still trying to
find my way around this place.

09:18.917 --> 09:20.917
-Where's the library?
-Sorry, I'm late for class.

09:20.917 --> 09:22.041
Will you point
the right direction?

09:22.041 --> 09:23.166
West quad.

09:24.083 --> 09:25.542
[sighs]

09:29.125 --> 09:30.750
[Emma] They said
he'd be in the cafeteria.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.209
That's got to be him.

09:35.084 --> 09:37.458
-Dr. Benson?
-That's right.

09:37.458 --> 09:40.209
Hi. I'm Emma Becker.

09:40.209 --> 09:42.708
And I was just wondering
if you remembered

09:42.708 --> 09:44.959
a former patient
named Annie Hobbs?

09:47.084 --> 09:50.167
[clears throat]
Yeah. Poor woman.

09:50.167 --> 09:54.209
My entire career,
I've only delivered
two stillborn babies.

09:54.209 --> 09:56.875
It's not something
you ever forget.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.667
Well, do you remember
another woman

09:58.667 --> 10:00.250
that gave birth
to twins that day?

10:00.250 --> 10:03.208
She actually gave them up
for adoption.

10:03.208 --> 10:04.708
Where are you going with this?

10:04.708 --> 10:07.041
Well, I am one of those twins

10:07.041 --> 10:08.583
and I'm just looking
for my birth mother.

10:09.792 --> 10:11.000
Oh, I see.

10:12.583 --> 10:14.125
Yeah, I do remember
your mother

10:14.125 --> 10:17.458
but I'm afraid that was
a closed adoption.

10:17.458 --> 10:19.083
Those papers are sealed.

10:19.083 --> 10:21.792
But it wasn't
an official adoption.
I know that for a fact.

10:21.792 --> 10:24.417
I... I don't know
what you're implying,

10:24.417 --> 10:26.291
but revealing
that information to you

10:26.291 --> 10:28.375
would be breaking the law.

10:28.375 --> 10:31.208
I understand this is
probably not the answer

10:31.208 --> 10:33.917
that you'd like to hear,

10:33.917 --> 10:35.708
but it's the only answer
you're going to get.

10:35.708 --> 10:37.125
If you'll excuse me.

10:39.042 --> 10:40.209
Thank you.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.375
Hey. I screwed up.

10:52.375 --> 10:55.042
Laurel overheard me
this morning talking
on the phone to Emma

10:55.042 --> 10:57.875
and I said it was Sutton
and then she saw Sutton.

10:57.875 --> 10:59.250
And now she's asking me
all these questions

10:59.250 --> 11:00.834
and I told her
to drop it, but...

11:00.834 --> 11:02.125
-She hasn't.
-No.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.083
-Okay, save me.
-Uh...

11:08.166 --> 11:09.875
What is up with her attitude?

11:09.875 --> 11:11.583
It's like she's been
taking Sutton lessons.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.041
Sutton lessons?

11:13.041 --> 11:16.333
Wow.
Sounds dramatic and expensive.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.834
Speaking of Sutton,
is it just me or...

11:18.834 --> 11:21.125
Does she seem kind of
off to you lately?

11:21.125 --> 11:22.250
Off how?

11:22.250 --> 11:24.166
Well, just acting
really sweet one second,

11:24.166 --> 11:27.500
and then morphing into
an entitled bitch the next.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.000
Moody and unpredictable?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.500
Classic Sutton.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.458
Why? What do you think
she's up to?

11:32.458 --> 11:34.000
I don't know.

11:34.834 --> 11:37.291
But I'm gonna find out.

11:37.291 --> 11:38.625
Okay.

11:41.084 --> 11:42.667
[Theresa] This is my last one.

11:42.667 --> 11:44.209
I still have work tomorrow.

11:44.209 --> 11:45.250
What?

11:45.250 --> 11:47.333
Come on, I remember when
we were back in the academy

11:47.333 --> 11:49.583
it was you pushing me
for last call.

11:49.583 --> 11:52.000
Remember, let loose with a...

11:52.000 --> 11:54.041
Whiskey neat
after a long, hard day?

11:54.041 --> 11:55.959
Yeah, and then you'd have
to cover for me

11:55.959 --> 11:59.000
when I was puking
during the morning run.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.125
We were so young and so crazy.

12:01.375 --> 12:03.000
I know.

12:08.542 --> 12:10.542
Oh, oh, my God!

12:12.500 --> 12:14.083
Oh, my God.

12:14.083 --> 12:16.250
I wanna stay young
and crazy with you

12:16.250 --> 12:17.583
for the rest of my life.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.333
Will you marry me, baby?

12:23.041 --> 12:24.125
Yes.

12:24.834 --> 12:26.458
-Yes?
-Yes.

12:27.542 --> 12:29.209
-Let me put it on.
-Okay.

12:29.209 --> 12:30.500
[bike approaching]

12:40.042 --> 12:41.250
Breathe, guys.

12:42.625 --> 12:44.333
You know what,
is that any way to talk

12:44.333 --> 12:47.209
to your future
sister-in-law?

12:47.917 --> 12:49.042
[chuckles]

12:51.041 --> 12:53.000
I don't know what to say.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Say you'll be my best man.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.625
Of course I will, man.

12:58.834 --> 13:01.125
I just can't believe
Dan picked that ring out
on his own.

13:01.125 --> 13:04.084
I bought it when we were
back in the academy.

13:04.750 --> 13:07.042
Kept it all these years.

13:07.042 --> 13:08.708
-Baby!
-[chuckles]

13:10.166 --> 13:12.417
-I love you.
-I love you.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.875
We are definitely gonna
need a bigger trailer.

13:18.084 --> 13:19.917
Amazing spread, Kristin,
thank you.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.375
I'm very grateful
for this second chance

13:23.375 --> 13:24.583
if that is what this is.

13:26.083 --> 13:27.166
It's a start.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.458
[scoffs]

13:32.209 --> 13:34.875
Sutton? Is there,
is there something wrong?

13:42.291 --> 13:44.000
Where did you get this?

13:44.000 --> 13:45.375
Does it matter?

13:45.375 --> 13:46.834
It's yours, right?

13:49.125 --> 13:50.250
How can you sit there

13:50.250 --> 13:53.291
and judge Dad when you are
the biggest liar of all?

13:53.291 --> 13:55.458
Someone want to tell me
what's going on here?

13:55.458 --> 13:57.750
It's a journal I kept
as part of my therapy

13:57.750 --> 14:00.375
after we adopted Sutton
before Laurel was born.

14:00.375 --> 14:02.000
You read Mom's journal?

14:02.000 --> 14:04.166
-Sutton?
-It's very detailed.

14:04.166 --> 14:06.667
All about how she didn't
want me in the first place
and how she

14:06.667 --> 14:08.417
-wanted to give me back.
-Wait a second.

14:08.417 --> 14:10.542
I don't know how you got this,
but you listen to me.

14:10.542 --> 14:12.750
Those were just my feelings,
my private feelings.

14:12.750 --> 14:14.458
No one's ever supposed
to hear any of it.

14:14.458 --> 14:16.458
You wanted to give
Sutton back?

14:16.458 --> 14:18.792
I was alone
all day with Sutton,

14:18.792 --> 14:22.000
pregnant with Laurel,
off my anti-depressants.
I was drowning.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.792
And how about
your feelings for Alec?

14:23.792 --> 14:25.333
-You wrote all about them.
-Wait a second.

14:25.333 --> 14:27.125
-Alec?
-No, that is nothing.

14:27.125 --> 14:28.417
Well, it must have
been something

14:28.417 --> 14:30.000
if you put it in a journal.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.042
Ted, please,
just listen to me.

14:32.042 --> 14:34.291
No, you know what,
I think I have heard plenty.

14:39.208 --> 14:41.792
-What you read,
it was never meant for you.
-[door closes]

14:41.792 --> 14:44.250
You have to trust me on this.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.375
Those first few months
after we brought you home,

14:46.375 --> 14:48.458
they were so hard on me,
physically, mentally.

14:48.458 --> 14:50.792
But even in my darkest hour,
you...

14:50.792 --> 14:52.291
You were my light.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.458
You say that...

14:55.208 --> 14:56.542
But I don't feel it.

14:59.209 --> 15:00.792
And I never have.

15:10.875 --> 15:13.458
[door opens]

15:15.000 --> 15:16.625
-Hey.
-Hi.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.083
Ice cream, huh?

15:19.083 --> 15:20.125
Desperate times?

15:21.167 --> 15:22.708
Yeah, it works.

15:23.500 --> 15:26.041
So does a visit
from a cute boy.

15:26.041 --> 15:27.542
Thank you for coming.

15:29.250 --> 15:30.750
So how was dinner?

15:30.750 --> 15:33.042
Appropriately horrifying.

15:33.042 --> 15:34.458
You showed Kristin
the journal?

15:34.458 --> 15:37.458
Yeah, I did,
in front of the whole family.

15:37.458 --> 15:40.583
And for the record,
she admitted to everything,
so...

15:40.583 --> 15:42.375
There you go.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.542
What was Laurel's reaction?

15:44.542 --> 15:47.542
I haven't talked to her
about it.

15:47.542 --> 15:49.000
Why?

15:49.000 --> 15:51.250
Because she's been
asking questions.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.208
I think she's close to
finding out about Emma.

15:53.834 --> 15:55.417
Ugh!

15:55.417 --> 15:57.125
Maybe it's time to tell her.

15:57.125 --> 16:00.167
Are you kidding?
Laurel knowing
would just make it worse.

16:02.084 --> 16:03.834
Oh, God, this is a mess.

16:05.084 --> 16:06.083
[sighs]

16:06.083 --> 16:07.917
Come here.

16:08.917 --> 16:10.208
It'll be all right.

16:11.917 --> 16:14.209
I guess that makes it
a little bit better.

16:17.084 --> 16:20.042
Well, you really blew up on 14
but you still shot a 76.

16:20.042 --> 16:22.084
I mean, you crushed me.

16:22.084 --> 16:24.333
Barely said two words
the whole round, though.

16:24.333 --> 16:26.500
Want to tell me
what's going on?

16:27.542 --> 16:28.959
-Arnold Palmer, please.
-Right.

16:28.959 --> 16:31.167
Sutton found an old journal
of Kristin's.

16:31.167 --> 16:32.917
From right after we moved
back here to Scottsdale.

16:32.917 --> 16:34.000
You know anything about it?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.625
No.

16:35.625 --> 16:37.083
Why would I?

16:37.083 --> 16:38.750
You two were pretty close
back then.

16:38.750 --> 16:40.125
And...

16:40.875 --> 16:42.917
And... What?

16:45.291 --> 16:47.208
Teddy, you wanna take
a walk down memory lane,

16:47.208 --> 16:49.250
you gotta give me a heads up.

16:49.250 --> 16:50.667
Forget it.

16:51.417 --> 16:52.875
Forgotten.

16:55.208 --> 16:56.583
Sutton.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.084
Alec.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.209
-Missed your dad.
-Hmm.

17:03.209 --> 17:05.959
And he seems pretty distracted
about something.

17:05.959 --> 17:07.125
I wish I knew what it was.

17:08.750 --> 17:10.458
My mom was in love with you.

17:12.750 --> 17:14.084
She kept a journal.

17:14.084 --> 17:15.250
I read it.

17:16.125 --> 17:18.042
It seems...

17:18.042 --> 17:19.750
That you were there for her

17:20.417 --> 17:21.959
when my dad wasn't.

17:23.708 --> 17:25.917
It's just one surprise
after another.

17:36.583 --> 17:37.834
You're looking a little red.

17:39.167 --> 17:40.417
Thought I could
help you re-apply.

17:41.667 --> 17:43.000
I've got a spray.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.542
Covers all the
hard-to-reach areas

17:44.542 --> 17:47.041
and I've got some reading
to do for English, so...

17:48.041 --> 17:49.458
Really?

17:49.458 --> 17:51.166
Look, I had fun
the other night.

17:51.166 --> 17:52.834
It seemed like you did, too.

17:52.834 --> 17:54.042
What happened?

17:54.875 --> 17:56.291
You ask too many questions.

17:56.291 --> 17:58.333
If you're freaked out
about the whole
step-sibling thing...

17:58.333 --> 18:00.834
-It's weird.
-Yeah, but we're not
blood-related.

18:00.834 --> 18:02.834
Marsha and Greg made it work.

18:02.834 --> 18:05.125
In the movie, at least.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.083
Well,  The Brady Bunch
isn't real life.

18:07.083 --> 18:09.333
Right.
But we have something...

18:09.333 --> 18:11.708
All right,
and you can't deny that.

18:11.708 --> 18:14.750
What we had was anonymous sex
in a swimming pool.

18:14.750 --> 18:17.291
I know, but ever since then,
I... I look at you,

18:17.291 --> 18:19.125
and I...
I feel this thing.

18:20.125 --> 18:21.458
And I know you do, too.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.166
Sorry for interrupting
your sun time.

18:33.084 --> 18:34.291
[door opens]

18:35.333 --> 18:36.834
[door closes]

18:47.167 --> 18:48.458
[sighs]

18:50.750 --> 18:52.375
I feel that thing, too.

18:54.209 --> 18:55.834
And it scares me.

19:04.333 --> 19:05.542
Better?

19:05.542 --> 19:06.875
A little.

19:09.125 --> 19:10.625
That's too bad.

19:10.625 --> 19:12.208
I was hoping for a lot.

19:19.542 --> 19:20.917
[knocking on door]

19:25.792 --> 19:27.417
Alec. What?

19:28.417 --> 19:29.750
What are you doing here?

19:29.750 --> 19:31.583
I just happened to be
in the neighborhood.

19:31.583 --> 19:33.209
You mind if I come in?

19:34.625 --> 19:36.125
I just wanted to
check on you, I...

19:36.125 --> 19:38.209
Played some golf
with Ted this morning,

19:38.209 --> 19:40.042
and he said you two
had a fight.

19:40.042 --> 19:41.250
I don't...

19:41.250 --> 19:43.583
I don't wanna talk about it.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.625
I understand.
You don't have to.

19:45.625 --> 19:47.458
I just came by to tell you...

19:48.041 --> 19:49.750
It'll pass.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.167
And he'll come around.

19:53.041 --> 19:54.333
I'm not so sure.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.417
Kristin, um...

19:57.500 --> 19:58.542
He...

20:00.291 --> 20:02.250
He mentioned something
about a journal.

20:03.083 --> 20:04.250
Is that...

20:06.209 --> 20:08.083
Those are thoughts
from a long time ago.

20:08.083 --> 20:09.667
Thoughts...

20:11.083 --> 20:13.000
Thoughts I shouldn't
share with you.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.333
Come on, you can't
punish yourself

20:14.333 --> 20:16.834
for having thoughts, Kristin.
That's not fair.

20:19.041 --> 20:20.583
Look, you know...

20:27.542 --> 20:29.250
You know, we all...

20:29.250 --> 20:31.875
We all feel things
we shouldn't sometimes.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.750
Three nurses
on duty that night.

20:44.750 --> 20:46.333
She was in the delivery room
when you were born.

20:48.209 --> 20:50.708
Well, let's hope
she's got a good memory.

20:50.708 --> 20:53.000
There she is.
Fingers crossed.

20:54.417 --> 20:55.708
Hi.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.125
Hello. Can I help you?

20:59.125 --> 21:01.000
Uh, I hope so.

21:03.667 --> 21:06.291
Well, that's quite a story.

21:06.291 --> 21:08.708
And I'm not stopping
until I know the truth.

21:09.041 --> 21:10.291
[sighs]

21:12.333 --> 21:14.125
Do you have children?

21:14.125 --> 21:16.291
Yes. And grandchildren.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.042
So, every scraped knee
and gold star

21:23.042 --> 21:26.167
and broken heart, they know
they can come to you.

21:26.167 --> 21:30.000
And I never had that.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.166
[chuckles]

21:31.166 --> 21:32.917
I guess I never will.

21:33.834 --> 21:34.959
Let's go.

21:36.083 --> 21:38.917
Uh... All right.

21:39.208 --> 21:40.208
Look...

21:41.375 --> 21:43.125
I don't remember her name,

21:43.125 --> 21:45.834
but I do remember
what she looked like.

21:45.834 --> 21:48.333
And you look an awful
lot like her.

21:48.333 --> 21:51.000
A while back,
I saw her in one of those, um,

21:51.000 --> 21:53.209
celebrity gossip magazines.

21:53.209 --> 21:56.667
She had a big wedding
up in Malibu,

21:56.667 --> 21:59.250
and I think married
a record producer
or something.

22:00.166 --> 22:02.542
Was his name Marvin Lyle?

22:02.542 --> 22:05.250
I couldn't possibly remember.
I don't know.

22:05.250 --> 22:06.542
Is this her?

22:11.500 --> 22:12.708
Yes.

22:13.792 --> 22:15.041
That's her.

22:16.083 --> 22:17.500
That's your birth mother.

22:23.458 --> 22:25.291
[birds chirping]

22:31.625 --> 22:34.042
Hooker heels.
Must be a special occasion.

22:34.042 --> 22:37.041
I have a date with Ethan.

22:37.041 --> 22:39.542
So, everything
I said about Thayer
being the right guy for you,

22:39.542 --> 22:41.875
you just totally ignored.

22:41.875 --> 22:44.209
The heart wants what it wants.

22:44.209 --> 22:46.209
You'll learn that one day.

22:46.209 --> 22:48.208
Maybe it'll be the same day
you'll learn all about

22:48.208 --> 22:49.583
personal boundaries.

22:50.125 --> 22:51.834
You need to talk to mom.

22:51.834 --> 22:53.375
And you need to leave.

22:53.375 --> 22:55.084
What is your deal?

22:55.084 --> 22:56.792
You want to get this
family back together
one minute,

22:56.792 --> 22:58.000
break us up the next!

22:58.000 --> 22:59.667
You're into Thayer
but dating Ethan.

22:59.667 --> 23:01.625
I didn't realize
I was being watched.

23:01.625 --> 23:03.041
I asked Ethan and Mads
about you

23:03.041 --> 23:04.500
and they both acted
super weird

23:04.500 --> 23:05.959
like they were hiding
some big secret.

23:07.083 --> 23:09.583
The only thing super weird

23:09.583 --> 23:12.417
is your obsession with me
and my friends.

23:14.625 --> 23:16.084
Get out of my room!

23:19.625 --> 23:23.250
So he taped the ring to
the side of a beer can.

23:23.250 --> 23:26.792
How... Almost romantic.

23:26.792 --> 23:29.250
It was very us.

23:31.417 --> 23:33.208
Do you think
I should warn her?

23:33.792 --> 23:35.209
No, no.

23:35.209 --> 23:37.667
Her eyes are wide open.
Not to worry.

23:37.667 --> 23:40.875
Hey, I'm sorry about
the Derek Rogers case.

23:40.875 --> 23:42.208
I know that meant
a lot to you.

23:42.208 --> 23:44.375
Why, what are you
talking about?

23:44.375 --> 23:46.583
Oh, man.
I thought you knew.

23:46.583 --> 23:48.625
I wouldn't have brought it up,
not here.

23:48.625 --> 23:50.250
Dan, we're off the case.

23:50.250 --> 23:52.375
The sarge say why?

23:52.375 --> 23:53.875
We're beat cops.

23:53.875 --> 23:55.917
We should have never
been investigating
in the first place.

23:58.375 --> 24:00.458
Hey, you ready
to give the toast?

24:01.625 --> 24:03.125
You're gonna say something,
right?

24:03.125 --> 24:05.583
Yes, yes, of course.
I just... Need a second.

24:05.583 --> 24:08.209
For you, sir.
From the gentleman at the bar.

24:08.209 --> 24:09.083
He says congratulations.

24:13.125 --> 24:14.417
[indistinct chattering]

24:21.167 --> 24:23.500
-Hey, Dan.
-Alec.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.333
Thank you for the champagne.

24:27.041 --> 24:29.583
It's unexpected
and unnecessary.

24:30.125 --> 24:32.083
Come on.
You deserve it.

24:33.333 --> 24:35.083
I see, uh...

24:35.083 --> 24:38.042
Sutton and Ethan
are back together, huh?

24:39.000 --> 24:40.583
Boy, you miss out
on all the hot gossip

24:40.583 --> 24:41.917
when you're behind bars,
don't you?

24:41.917 --> 24:43.083
She's been helping him study.

24:43.083 --> 24:44.542
She can be a sweetheart.

24:44.542 --> 24:46.542
Why are you here?

24:46.542 --> 24:50.167
What, a guy can't buy
a friend a bottle of champagne

24:50.167 --> 24:51.500
and not expect
anything in return?

24:51.500 --> 24:52.834
[chuckles]

24:52.834 --> 24:55.041
Not if his name's Alec Rybak.

24:55.041 --> 24:57.417
In all fairness,

24:57.417 --> 25:00.917
the reason I'm out of jail is
because of you and Theresa.
I know that.

25:00.917 --> 25:02.750
[Dan] Listen, Alec,
if this whole thing
is about

25:02.750 --> 25:04.875
the murder investigation,
you're talking
to the wrong guy,

25:04.875 --> 25:07.042
because I just got
tossed off the case.

25:07.042 --> 25:08.166
Even better.

25:08.166 --> 25:10.375
Then we can do this
off the record

25:10.375 --> 25:11.542
and kind of below the radar.

25:12.167 --> 25:14.000
Do what?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.667
I need you to prove,
once and for all...

25:16.667 --> 25:18.166
That I'm an innocent man.

25:19.125 --> 25:21.417
Danny, look.

25:21.417 --> 25:24.167
I know I ride you hard,
keep you on a short leash,

25:24.167 --> 25:26.542
but this isn't about me, okay?

25:26.542 --> 25:28.167
This is about justice.

25:28.167 --> 25:30.750
That's important to your
fiancee, isn't it?

25:33.542 --> 25:35.708
Yeah.

25:35.708 --> 25:38.375
Why don't you talk it over
with Theresa?

25:38.375 --> 25:40.084
I'll get back with you.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.500
[indistinct chattering]

25:52.083 --> 25:54.708
Thanks for
inviting me tonight.

25:54.708 --> 25:57.041
It was a nice distraction.

25:57.041 --> 25:59.084
We didn't talk about
what's going on.

25:59.084 --> 26:00.500
Oh, it's better that way.

26:01.250 --> 26:02.792
Not to talk.

26:10.041 --> 26:12.959
Is... Is Kristin home?

26:12.959 --> 26:16.959
Unclear. I've avoided her
since journal-gate.

26:16.959 --> 26:18.375
But I'm kind of tired

26:18.375 --> 26:20.166
so maybe we should
call it a night.

26:20.166 --> 26:21.542
Oh.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.125
We have school tomorrow.

26:34.125 --> 26:36.375
Since when does Sutton Mercer
care about school?

26:36.375 --> 26:38.959
Since Emma set the bar
way too high.

26:40.208 --> 26:44.167
Plus, I don't wanna jeopardize
all the progress you've made.

26:44.167 --> 26:45.458
How considerate.

26:47.125 --> 26:49.083
All right. Good night.

26:49.083 --> 26:50.750
Good night.

26:52.542 --> 26:53.542
[door opens]

27:13.750 --> 27:15.083
[knock on door]

27:16.041 --> 27:17.291
Sutton?

27:32.708 --> 27:34.125
[seagulls calling]

27:36.500 --> 27:38.792
It all fits together.

27:38.792 --> 27:41.083
Rebecca and Sutton
met at the motel

27:41.083 --> 27:43.041
where they formed
some kind of a...

27:43.041 --> 27:45.000
Partnership.
Like an alliance.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.500
And then for whatever reason

27:46.500 --> 27:49.000
Rebecca was protecting
the secret that
she was your birth mother.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.291
That's why Derek was killed.

27:50.291 --> 27:53.000
Rebecca murdered him
to make sure that
the truth stayed hidden.

27:56.333 --> 27:57.708
But why?

27:57.708 --> 27:59.708
I don't know.

27:59.708 --> 28:01.917
I don't know why. I don't even
know what their plan is.

28:02.583 --> 28:04.000
[sighs]

28:07.375 --> 28:09.125
For as long
as I can remember...

28:10.458 --> 28:12.708
I always wondered
about my mother.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.708
Who she was and...

28:17.166 --> 28:19.084
Why she would just leave me?

28:22.875 --> 28:25.084
And now,

28:25.084 --> 28:27.750
I find out that she's been
there this whole time

28:27.750 --> 28:29.417
just shutting me out.

28:31.250 --> 28:34.375
And Sutton is
maybe helping her?

28:38.084 --> 28:40.500
You know, you wanna think
that your mother loves you.

28:40.500 --> 28:43.125
And I guess
I just was hoping

28:43.125 --> 28:45.125
that all the time
I was wondering,

28:45.125 --> 28:47.792
she was wondering, too.

28:47.792 --> 28:49.375
I know this has to be
really hard on you.

28:51.333 --> 28:53.667
All I ever wanted
was a family.

28:54.209 --> 28:56.084
You have that.

28:56.084 --> 28:57.792
With Ted, with Kristin.

28:58.375 --> 29:00.000
Laurel.

29:01.125 --> 29:02.458
You.

29:04.166 --> 29:06.959
Why don't we just
go away somewhere?

29:06.959 --> 29:09.125
Get away as far as possible
from all this.

29:11.375 --> 29:13.042
I don't wanna do that.

29:14.125 --> 29:16.208
I wanna go home to Scottsdale.

29:16.208 --> 29:17.834
I need to face

29:17.834 --> 29:19.917
all these insane lies head-on.

29:26.208 --> 29:30.041
So, Kristin confessed to
everything. You were right.

29:30.041 --> 29:31.917
Of course I was.
I'm your mother.

29:31.917 --> 29:34.834
And Kristin isn't.

29:34.834 --> 29:37.542
-[Sutton] God, I'm so glad
you showed me that journal.
-[grunting]

29:37.542 --> 29:39.209
[indistinct chatter]

29:45.750 --> 29:49.166
I told Alec
about the journal.

29:49.166 --> 29:51.042
I know it wasn't
part of the plan, but I...

29:51.042 --> 29:53.208
Just wanted to hurt Kristin
for what she did.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.834
I know it was childish...

29:54.834 --> 29:56.792
You know what, sweetheart,
it's perfect, actually.

29:56.792 --> 29:59.209
Back in high school,
I could see it in Alec's eyes

29:59.209 --> 30:01.041
that he had a thing
for Kristin.

30:01.041 --> 30:04.125
And maybe now that he knows
that she shares his feelings,

30:04.125 --> 30:07.667
all those feelings
will start flooding back,
and...

30:07.667 --> 30:10.250
And maybe the two of them
will have an affair

30:10.250 --> 30:12.083
which gives you
grounds for divorce.

30:12.083 --> 30:14.000
Well, a girl can dream.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.208
[Sutton] You never
cease to amaze me.

30:15.208 --> 30:17.542
[Rebecca] I'm just
keeping my eye
on the prize, Sutton.

30:17.542 --> 30:19.834
So, what's with
the sexy dress?

30:19.834 --> 30:23.041
I was with Ethan at Dan
and Theresa's
engagement party.

30:23.041 --> 30:24.834
-They're engaged?
-Mmm-hmm.

30:24.834 --> 30:27.542
-How power couple!
-Alec was there.

30:27.542 --> 30:29.125
I overheard him
talking to Dan,

30:29.125 --> 30:30.542
telling him that
he wants him to keep

30:30.542 --> 30:32.834
investigating Derek's murder.

30:32.834 --> 30:34.083
Well, of course, he does.

30:34.083 --> 30:35.834
He wants to clear
his precious name.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.041
He thinks that there's
a killer still out there.

30:38.041 --> 30:40.250
Do you think maybe he's right?

30:40.250 --> 30:41.834
That he is being framed?

30:41.834 --> 30:44.417
No. He killed Derek Rogers.
I'm sure of it.

30:44.417 --> 30:46.166
We just need to find
another way to prove it.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.542
[Rebecca] I don't know.
We just need
to figure it out...

30:50.542 --> 30:51.792
[screams]

30:52.209 --> 30:53.041
[gasps]

30:54.000 --> 30:55.291
[Sutton] What was that?

30:56.250 --> 30:57.458
Oh, my God,
it's Laurel.

30:59.167 --> 31:01.208
Laurel?

31:01.208 --> 31:03.167
[Rebecca] She must have
fallen off the wall.

31:03.167 --> 31:04.750
[Sutton] I don't understand,
what was she doing up there?

31:05.834 --> 31:08.458
911.
There's been an accident.

31:18.125 --> 31:19.500
[indistinct chatter]

31:20.542 --> 31:22.417
What's going on?

31:22.417 --> 31:24.917
Hi. She's in with the doctor.

31:24.917 --> 31:27.375
And I've been assured
that she's okay.

31:27.375 --> 31:29.834
What exactly were my girls
doing at your house
in the first place?

31:29.834 --> 31:32.208
Well, I was looking
for Mads, and...

31:33.209 --> 31:34.542
We think, um...

31:34.542 --> 31:37.000
Well, she has a crush
on my stepson Jordan.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.375
We think she was
looking for him.

31:38.375 --> 31:40.291
I didn't even know
she was there.

31:40.291 --> 31:41.667
-Hey, Bill.
-Hey, Ted.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.209
She's a little out of it

31:43.209 --> 31:45.166
but no major changes
in alertness.

31:45.166 --> 31:47.166
And no unusual eye movements.

31:47.166 --> 31:49.125
I'd still like to keep
her overnight, though.

31:49.125 --> 31:51.542
-Thanks, Bill.
-Thank you.

31:51.542 --> 31:53.125
Thanks for taking care
of Laurel.

31:53.125 --> 31:54.125
We'll take it from here.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.917
Nice cover.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.250
Do you need anything
before I go?

32:02.208 --> 32:06.084
No, I've got a train full
of drama headed my way.

32:06.084 --> 32:07.041
Derail it.

32:08.875 --> 32:10.917
Please tell me that you aren't
somehow involved in all this.

32:10.917 --> 32:13.000
[Sutton] Of course not.
She was looking for Jordan.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.417
You know all about her crush.

32:14.417 --> 32:15.708
I don't believe you.

32:15.708 --> 32:17.417
I think she was
looking for you.

32:17.417 --> 32:20.084
She was looking for answers
and she has been for days.

32:20.084 --> 32:22.166
Well, that's because
you screwed up.

32:22.166 --> 32:24.250
I made a mistake
and I tried to cover

32:24.250 --> 32:26.084
but all of this is
spiraling out of control...

32:26.084 --> 32:29.042
All right, all right,
just calm down, okay?
This isn't Mads' fault.

32:29.042 --> 32:30.834
This is getting harder
for everybody.

32:30.834 --> 32:33.125
You know what,
I don't need this right now.

32:34.792 --> 32:36.583
[indistinct announcement]

32:38.333 --> 32:40.166
I just flat-out
don't trust the guy.

32:40.166 --> 32:42.208
Alec, may be a lot
of horrible things

32:42.208 --> 32:45.667
but in this case,
I think he's innocent.

32:45.667 --> 32:47.625
There is a reason
I agreed to represent him.

32:47.625 --> 32:49.917
A reason you can't tell me.

32:50.375 --> 32:51.959
All right, look...

32:51.959 --> 32:54.042
If you find Derek's killer,

32:54.042 --> 32:55.792
Alec's name is cleared.

32:55.792 --> 32:58.042
But if Alec is somehow
behind all of this,

32:58.042 --> 33:00.167
you put him away for good.

33:00.167 --> 33:01.250
But what if I get caught?

33:01.250 --> 33:04.250
I'm not a registered PI.
They could throw me
off the force.

33:04.250 --> 33:06.458
You're being a friend,
helping out another friend.

33:06.458 --> 33:08.166
You ask a few questions,
follow a few leads,

33:08.166 --> 33:09.917
and just keep everything
off-duty.

33:09.917 --> 33:13.125
I just don't want us to get
tangled up with him again.

33:14.208 --> 33:16.083
I won't lose you twice.

33:16.083 --> 33:19.084
Dan... Dan, I love you.

33:19.084 --> 33:20.959
I want to marry you.

33:20.959 --> 33:23.167
You're not gonna lose me.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.458
Okay.

33:27.875 --> 33:29.042
[chuckles]

33:32.917 --> 33:35.209
[Alec] Jordan's out there
swimming laps.

33:36.875 --> 33:38.417
Kid's like a fish.

33:38.417 --> 33:40.167
Hm. Hadn't noticed.

33:40.333 --> 33:41.542
Really?

33:45.917 --> 33:47.333
Honey, I need you
to be honest with me.

33:48.125 --> 33:49.458
[sighs]

33:50.750 --> 33:52.375
Anything going on
between you two?

33:52.375 --> 33:54.333
-What?
-Anything I should know about?

33:54.333 --> 33:55.959
No!

33:55.959 --> 33:57.458
He's my...

33:58.208 --> 33:59.542
No.

33:59.542 --> 34:01.750
No, there's no reason
for you to get
all overprotective.

34:01.750 --> 34:03.875
I'm your father,
that comes with the job.

34:04.959 --> 34:08.417
Honey, you're a beautiful,
bright girl.

34:09.750 --> 34:11.208
And I don't want you
to get hurt.

34:11.917 --> 34:13.500
You deserve the world.

34:13.500 --> 34:15.792
Thank you, Dad, but I'm fine.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.083
What do you know about him?

34:19.125 --> 34:21.291
He's from California.

34:21.291 --> 34:23.875
Hates his dad, likes to swim.

34:23.875 --> 34:26.583
And you have nothing
to worry about.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.291
Okay.

34:30.291 --> 34:32.333
[Laurel] It's all a blur.
I'm so confused.

34:35.167 --> 34:36.250
What were you doing
on that wall?

34:36.250 --> 34:38.166
Were you really chasing a boy?

34:38.166 --> 34:40.792
I followed Sutton
to Rebecca's.

34:42.834 --> 34:45.708
There's something
she doesn't want me to know.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.041
What wouldn't
she want you to know?

34:49.708 --> 34:52.208
I think there are two of them.

34:52.208 --> 34:54.959
Two? Two of who?

34:57.291 --> 35:00.208
There are just things
that don't make any sense.

35:00.208 --> 35:03.167
Sweetie, you hit your head
pretty hard.

35:03.167 --> 35:04.667
You get some sleep,
you'll be fine.

35:15.084 --> 35:17.792
Hey.
Where have you been?

35:17.792 --> 35:20.208
Why? Do I have a curfew now?

35:20.208 --> 35:23.667
No, but you were supposed
to be hanging with Laurel.

35:23.667 --> 35:25.959
Instead, she was sneaking
around here.

35:25.959 --> 35:27.542
Well, it's not my fault
she fell.

35:27.542 --> 35:29.500
No, but if you
had been with her
this wouldn't have happened.

35:30.375 --> 35:32.041
This isn't about Laurel,
all right?

35:32.041 --> 35:34.583
This is you being pissed that
I didn't follow your orders.

35:34.583 --> 35:36.250
This plan of yours...

35:36.250 --> 35:38.500
I thought it was for me
to get close to Laurel and...

35:38.500 --> 35:41.250
To get in with Ted
so he'd soften up
to you, but...

35:41.250 --> 35:43.041
Now I'm thinking that's not
the case at all, is it?

35:44.708 --> 35:47.000
You just want to
take away everything
that belongs to Kristin.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Pick that family apart
one by one.

35:50.042 --> 35:52.042
You're a really smart boy.

35:53.083 --> 35:55.166
But you have no idea
what you are talking about.

35:56.250 --> 35:58.042
Do as you're told.

35:58.042 --> 36:00.458
Unless you want everyone
in Scottsdale
to know what you did.

36:09.291 --> 36:10.625
Handsome Dan.

36:13.166 --> 36:15.750
I love what you've done
with the place.

36:15.750 --> 36:17.875
You got an eye
for landscaping, man,
that's for sure.

36:17.875 --> 36:19.708
If I'd have known you were
coming over a little earlier,

36:19.708 --> 36:21.708
I would have
picked you some flowers.

36:22.291 --> 36:23.834
Thoughtful.

36:23.834 --> 36:25.041
Sorry, I can't give you
a heads up.

36:25.041 --> 36:26.917
You know we can't
do this stuff on the phone.

36:26.917 --> 36:29.667
Right, so, presumably
you have some theories,

36:29.667 --> 36:32.041
some suspects, uh,
where do I start with this?

36:32.041 --> 36:34.667
Jordan Lyle.
I want you to look into him.

36:34.667 --> 36:36.125
See what his connection
is with Rebecca.

36:36.959 --> 36:38.083
She's his stepmother.

36:38.875 --> 36:40.375
Whatever she is,

36:40.375 --> 36:42.959
she's at the center of it
and I think this kid
might be the key.

36:42.959 --> 36:44.708
All right, but you and Mads
live with them.

36:44.708 --> 36:46.166
So, if you think
there's something going on,

36:46.166 --> 36:48.875
why the hell are you
in the house?

36:48.875 --> 36:51.417
We got to look like
one big, happy family.

36:53.375 --> 36:55.750
Sounds like a dangerous game,
if you ask me.

36:56.041 --> 36:57.500
It is.

37:01.166 --> 37:02.250
[siren wails]

37:02.250 --> 37:04.000
[Ted]  We need to discuss this.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.208
Well, obviously,
neither of us is listening.

37:06.208 --> 37:07.792
We're talking.

37:07.792 --> 37:10.167
I had no idea you were
feeling any of those things.

37:10.167 --> 37:12.583
I had no idea
you were sleeping
with another woman.

37:12.583 --> 37:16.333
Well... Maybe if I had known
about your feelings for Alec.

37:16.333 --> 37:18.959
I never acted on them,
you acted on yours.

37:18.959 --> 37:20.542
That is a big difference, Ted.

37:20.542 --> 37:22.250
Yeah, if you say so.

37:30.084 --> 37:31.166
Did you hear any of that?

37:31.166 --> 37:35.041
Just that you were fighting
again.

37:35.041 --> 37:38.042
Honey, our fighting has to do
with our relationship,

37:38.042 --> 37:39.583
not you or your adoption.

37:41.084 --> 37:42.375
We always wanted you.

37:42.375 --> 37:45.375
From the moment I saw you,
I knew you were my daughter.

37:56.750 --> 37:58.875
[Sutton] Well,
look who's back.

37:58.875 --> 38:00.166
Laurel was in an accident?

38:01.417 --> 38:03.667
What happened?

38:03.667 --> 38:07.167
Laurel was chasing this
wild idea that I had a twin.

38:08.209 --> 38:10.458
You can thank Mads,
she got her started.

38:10.458 --> 38:11.875
I cannot believe this.

38:11.875 --> 38:14.125
You are supposed to be
taking care of this family.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.000
I tried.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
-I want to see Laurel.
-Too late.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.375
Visiting hours are over.

38:19.375 --> 38:20.875
Fine, we'll come back
in the morning.

38:20.875 --> 38:23.042
-No. No!
-Let's go.

38:23.042 --> 38:24.208
Let's switch back.

38:24.208 --> 38:26.125
Who said anything about
switching back at all?

38:26.125 --> 38:28.167
That was the plan, Sutton.

38:28.167 --> 38:31.959
I hide while
you play regionals
and then we switch back.

38:31.959 --> 38:34.125
What happened at regionals,
by the way?

38:34.125 --> 38:36.959
I lost in the first round.
I've already blocked it
from my memory.

38:36.959 --> 38:39.333
And yes, that was the plan
at some point.

38:39.333 --> 38:40.917
But?

38:40.917 --> 38:43.875
I realized
how nice it was being me.

38:45.417 --> 38:47.125
What are you saying?

38:47.125 --> 38:49.084
I'm saying you should
go back to L.A.

38:49.084 --> 38:50.625
Well, we're not going
anywhere, sorry.

38:50.625 --> 38:52.042
[Sutton] Why not?

38:52.042 --> 38:54.417
L.A. is obviously
way more fun
than this place,

38:54.417 --> 38:57.500
and we both know
that you never felt like
you belonged in Scottsdale.

38:57.500 --> 38:59.208
Emma, don't listen to her.

38:59.208 --> 39:01.417
And what about Ted
and Kristin and Laurel?

39:01.417 --> 39:03.167
I can't just leave them.

39:03.167 --> 39:06.583
Yes, you can. They're not
your family, they're mine.

39:06.583 --> 39:09.250
The truth is
you can drive away
right now

39:09.250 --> 39:11.209
and they wouldn't even realize
you were gone.

39:12.542 --> 39:14.500
This was always my life.

39:14.500 --> 39:16.792
You were just pretending
to be a part of it.

39:18.250 --> 39:20.333
You're right.

39:20.333 --> 39:21.875
I never should've
come back here.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.875
Well, I'm glad we agree.

39:24.875 --> 39:26.333
[Thayer] What?

39:26.333 --> 39:29.417
No, no, no, no.
I can't believe
you're just walking away.

39:29.417 --> 39:31.167
After everything we found?
Come on.

39:31.167 --> 39:33.000
I'm not walking away.

39:34.084 --> 39:35.959
She is.

39:35.959 --> 39:37.917
There's more than one entrance
to this hospital, let's go.

39:40.750 --> 39:42.041
[chuckles]

39:43.042 --> 39:45.083
I've told you how I feel.

39:45.083 --> 39:49.041
I told you how scared I am,
all these feelings I'm having.

39:49.041 --> 39:52.542
And I get the sense
that there's a lot
you're not telling me.

39:52.542 --> 39:55.167
I know I play cocky, but...

39:55.167 --> 39:57.041
It's not really me.

39:57.041 --> 39:59.875
I'm about to get the whole
"poor little rich boy" story?

40:02.042 --> 40:04.000
Rebecca's been there for me.

40:04.000 --> 40:08.083
I told her a lot of things
and now I owe her.

40:08.834 --> 40:10.083
And I hate it.

40:18.167 --> 40:20.000
Is there a problem, Officer?

40:21.291 --> 40:22.625
[Dan] I don't know,
you tell me.

40:23.375 --> 40:25.333
Sorry, this is all my fault.

40:25.333 --> 40:26.542
You shouldn't be here, Mads.

40:27.500 --> 40:30.083
I know, we were just...

40:30.083 --> 40:33.208
Yeah, just take her home. Now.

40:37.041 --> 40:39.500
You're on a first-name basis
with the cops?

40:39.500 --> 40:41.375
Well, Dan is Ethan's brother.

40:42.250 --> 40:44.041
He and my dad are close and...

40:44.041 --> 40:47.875
We really don't want my dad
finding out about us.

40:55.084 --> 40:56.625
What are you still doing here?

40:56.625 --> 40:59.083
Figured you needed
to blow off some steam.

40:59.083 --> 41:02.417
And that your family
needed some time alone.

41:02.417 --> 41:04.291
I was gonna look
for you in a few.

41:06.084 --> 41:08.083
Sorry about before.

41:08.083 --> 41:10.500
Just my parents fighting

41:10.500 --> 41:12.333
and Laurel's accident
and then her almost

41:12.333 --> 41:15.458
finding out the truth
about me and Emma.

41:15.458 --> 41:18.083
Anyway, it's under control.

41:18.083 --> 41:19.667
It was very sweet
of you to stay.

41:23.708 --> 41:25.333
Well, let me know
if you need anything.

41:43.250 --> 41:44.500
[Laurel] Hey, Mom.

41:44.500 --> 41:45.875
Hey.

41:46.375 --> 41:49.208
Okay, so I love you...

41:49.208 --> 41:52.042
But it's kind of hard
for me to sleep

41:52.042 --> 41:53.333
with you staring at me.

41:55.333 --> 41:57.750
Okay. I can leave for a bit.

41:59.042 --> 42:00.792
-I'm going to be
right outside.
-Okay.

42:09.625 --> 42:12.291
-Hey.
-You changed.

42:12.291 --> 42:14.291
Why would you change
in the middle of the night?

42:15.667 --> 42:17.917
Okay, Sutton,
this isn't funny anymore.

42:17.917 --> 42:20.417
It's like you're intentionally
trying to make me think
there's two of you.

42:22.834 --> 42:24.291
There are two of us.

42:25.167 --> 42:26.792
Laurel...

42:26.792 --> 42:29.291
I'm Emma,
Sutton's twin sister.

42:31.542 --> 42:33.917
And I'm going to need
your help.
