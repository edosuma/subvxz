WEBVTT

00:00.078 --> 00:02.851
<i>The '80s was the
golden age of the house party.</i>

00:02.945 --> 00:05.031
<i>If the music was cranked
and the place was wrecked,</i>

00:05.101 --> 00:06.424
<i>your bash was a hit.</i>

00:06.500 --> 00:08.757
<i>And it turned out I had
a hot tip about the latest one.</i>

00:08.850 --> 00:10.623
Yo, J.C., it's me, Adam.

00:10.702 --> 00:12.669
- Corey's brother!
- Not even a little bit.

00:12.704 --> 00:14.971
Anyway, I thought
you'd want to know about a rager

00:15.073 --> 00:16.539
at Dave Kim's this Saturday.

00:16.641 --> 00:17.830
Let all your bros know.

00:17.855 --> 00:18.851
Will do.

00:18.876 --> 00:20.642
Tell Corey he's a dirty dog.

00:20.711 --> 00:23.645
<i>I'd fed the grapevine a grape.
Only thing left to do was wait.</i>

00:23.714 --> 00:25.447
Party at Dave Kim's this Saturday.

00:25.549 --> 00:27.883
If there's no hot tub, we'll make one.

00:27.952 --> 00:29.651
Party at Dave Kim's this Saturday.

00:29.753 --> 00:30.953
There's gonna be 50 kegs,

00:31.055 --> 00:33.689
and Spuds MacKenzie is deejaying.

00:33.791 --> 00:35.524
Party at Dave Kim's this Saturday.

00:35.593 --> 00:37.226
I'll know if you don't show.

00:37.294 --> 00:39.394
Hubba Bubba Soda? Do better.

00:39.496 --> 00:40.896
<i>Word about the party spread fast,</i>

00:40.965 --> 00:42.431
<i>until everyone knew about it.</i>

00:42.466 --> 00:43.866
Party at Dave Kim's this Saturday.

00:43.968 --> 00:45.300
<i>Well, almost everyone.</i>

00:45.402 --> 00:46.501
What the hell?!

00:46.570 --> 00:48.270
Who's telling everybody
I'm throwing a party?

00:48.339 --> 00:50.105
They're the worst. And it's me.

00:50.174 --> 00:51.373
You?! Why?!

00:51.475 --> 00:52.808
Come on, Dave Kim!

00:52.877 --> 00:54.443
No one loves a kegger more than you.

00:54.545 --> 00:55.577
And it's a keg party?

00:55.646 --> 00:57.479
Yep, all kinds of savory brewskis...

00:57.581 --> 01:00.048
ales, lights, fruity ciders,
light beers.

01:00.150 --> 01:01.350
No, wait. Those are the lights.

01:01.418 --> 01:02.584
You don't know anything about beer!

01:02.653 --> 01:04.119
I do know your parents are out of town,

01:04.188 --> 01:07.055
and kegs attract popular kids,
and that's what I'm looking for.

01:07.124 --> 01:08.156
Is this about Brea Bee?

01:08.259 --> 01:09.725
Yes, it's about Brea Bee.

01:09.793 --> 01:11.426
I know we had a moment
while ice-skating,

01:11.495 --> 01:12.828
but I've barely seen her since.

01:12.897 --> 01:14.363
Now she's back to her ivory tower

01:14.465 --> 01:16.064
with the cool kids across the room.

01:16.133 --> 01:19.301
So you think that a party that
will inevitably destroy my home

01:19.370 --> 01:21.837
is just the opportunity you need
to reconnect?

01:21.872 --> 01:23.538
Will you help your best friend
find love?

01:23.641 --> 01:24.539
Hell no.

01:24.608 --> 01:25.941
I hear we're throwing a party.

01:25.976 --> 01:27.376
Oh, no! Carla's got wind of it!

01:27.478 --> 01:28.644
Bitch, I am the wind.

01:28.712 --> 01:31.647
And I've already got a theme...
mayhem and deep regret.

01:31.715 --> 01:34.716
Oh, no! That's a winner!
Who wouldn't come to that?

01:34.785 --> 01:36.451
I would, and hopefully so will Brea.

01:36.553 --> 01:37.819
Someone's a nasty boy.

01:37.888 --> 01:39.821
Ugh. It's lunchtime.

01:39.890 --> 01:42.524
I'm supposed to open
the wing store today!

01:42.593 --> 01:43.992
Why are you doing this to me?!

01:44.094 --> 01:45.494
Brea Bee is just a girl!

01:45.529 --> 01:47.162
Just a girl, Dave Kim?

01:47.231 --> 01:49.767
She's gorgeous, cool, and likes theater.

01:50.901 --> 01:52.768
Well, looks like your perfect dream girl

01:52.836 --> 01:54.403
just dropped her Trapper Keeper.

01:56.640 --> 01:57.906
Allow me, madam.

01:57.975 --> 01:59.308
Oh. Thanks, Adam.

01:59.410 --> 02:01.510
Ohh! Thank you.

02:01.578 --> 02:03.578
...in advance for my next question.

02:03.647 --> 02:06.114
Which is, if you had to pick one word

02:06.216 --> 02:08.183
to describe how you party,

02:08.285 --> 02:09.717
would it be "hardy"?

02:10.654 --> 02:12.754
Like Dave Kim's party... this Saturday.

02:12.823 --> 02:13.922
Oh! T-That might be fun.

02:13.991 --> 02:16.525
It's guaranteed to be a blast.
I'm planning it myself.

02:16.593 --> 02:17.893
I want to plan.

02:17.962 --> 02:19.928
The best part of partying is
the who, what, when, and where.

02:19.997 --> 02:21.129
Mm. With a little foresight,

02:21.231 --> 02:23.065
planning a party can be
as fun as attending.

02:23.100 --> 02:25.033
I'm pretty sure
me and Brea got it covered.

02:25.102 --> 02:26.535
Say, my place around 4:00?

02:26.603 --> 02:27.669
It's a date.

02:27.738 --> 02:29.738
Yeah, sorry. I actually
can't do it today.

02:29.807 --> 02:31.006
But I'll try to make the party.

02:31.108 --> 02:33.008
I know a solid maybe when I hear one.

02:33.077 --> 02:34.643
Whoa. Think she likes you.

02:34.745 --> 02:35.644
- Really?
- No.

02:35.746 --> 02:37.312
But now this won't feel so lousy.

02:37.414 --> 02:40.015
Oh, no! Wait! This is why you
don't put yourself out there!

02:40.084 --> 02:41.883
Oh, balls!

02:41.986 --> 02:43.552

<i>and my mom had no idea...</i>

02:59.403 --> 03:01.369
<i>...today would be one of
the best days of her life.</i>

03:01.509 --> 03:03.879
- Mr. Whitby?
- Indeed, it is I,

03:03.941 --> 03:07.042
your cookbook publisher
and well-regarded dog breeder.

03:07.144 --> 03:08.343
Come on in!

03:08.445 --> 03:09.711
Oh!

03:09.813 --> 03:13.682
What an incredibly authentic residence.

03:13.784 --> 03:16.685
Often, when I stare out at
Central Park from my penthouse,

03:16.787 --> 03:19.488
I imagine this is how other people live.

03:19.556 --> 03:21.857
So, you drove all the way from
the city to belittle our home?

03:21.959 --> 03:23.258
Surprise!

03:23.327 --> 03:25.160
I brought your cookbook
hot off the presses!

03:25.262 --> 03:27.396
It's not really hot.
That's just an expression.

03:27.498 --> 03:29.131
But it is warm from me sitting on it

03:29.233 --> 03:30.832
so I look more imposing in the car.

03:30.934 --> 03:33.101
Oh, my God! That's me! This is me!

03:33.203 --> 03:34.970
I guess we went with
the one with your face.

03:35.039 --> 03:36.605
Mom, you're on the cover
of your own book?

03:36.707 --> 03:38.673
- That's so cool!
- It really is!

03:38.742 --> 03:39.808
Am I in it?

03:39.910 --> 03:41.910
"Mrs. Goldberg resides
in the Philadelphia area

03:42.012 --> 03:43.612
with her husband and three children."

03:43.714 --> 03:45.580
This book is about me. Can I have this?

03:45.682 --> 03:47.582
- For only $14.95.
- Oh.

03:47.684 --> 03:50.318
That's what we'll be
selling it for at your signing.

03:50.421 --> 03:51.787
A book signing? Me?

03:51.889 --> 03:54.322
We find it goes a long way
when launching a new author.

03:54.425 --> 03:56.725
Also, your friends feel
too guilty not to buy one.

03:56.827 --> 03:58.393
I'll make them buy 50 each!

03:58.495 --> 04:01.229
Much of the publishing game
is about emotional blackmail.

04:01.331 --> 04:04.633
There's also a tremendous amount
of sexual intrigue.

04:04.735 --> 04:05.967
Maya Angelou.

04:06.070 --> 04:07.302
This guy's the real deal.

04:07.404 --> 04:08.870
Oh, this deal is real, all right...

04:08.972 --> 04:11.106
as real as my teenage daughter's
restraining order.

04:11.208 --> 04:12.674
City kids.

04:12.776 --> 04:14.342
You two are lucky you're so simple.

04:14.411 --> 04:15.310
I hate this guy.

04:15.412 --> 04:16.778
Uhp! You sound just like my daughter.

04:17.981 --> 04:19.481
Anyhoo, you'll be signing

04:19.583 --> 04:22.317
at the provincial book store
in this sad little town.

04:22.419 --> 04:24.986
I believe it's called
St. Ann's Book Dump.

04:25.089 --> 04:26.621
I think you mean B. Dalton.

04:26.690 --> 04:27.722
That makes more sense.

04:27.825 --> 04:30.158
Question... as an important relative

04:30.227 --> 04:32.727
featured prominently
on the back side flap,

04:32.830 --> 04:34.763
what kind of royalties can I expect?

04:34.865 --> 04:36.498
Well, I'm just gonna start talking

04:36.600 --> 04:38.500
and hope my sentence
carries me to the door.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.836
And I'm gonna start another
sentence, and there we go!

04:40.938 --> 04:43.171
<i>While my mom prepared
for her big night out,</i>

04:43.273 --> 04:45.841
<i>I had to prepare my room
for the cool kids.</i>

04:45.943 --> 04:47.909
Would a beautiful girl
like these parachute pants?

04:48.011 --> 04:50.178
I see why they threw them
out of a plane.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.546
Tomorrow needs to be perfect.

04:51.648 --> 04:54.583
And it will be. You're throwing
a party to land a girl.

04:54.685 --> 04:56.818
I've thrown millions of shindigs,

04:56.920 --> 04:58.787
and they all went gonzo.

04:58.889 --> 05:00.822
Gonzo's my favorite Muppet, so I'm in.

05:00.924 --> 05:02.791
First thought... don't mention Muppets.

05:02.893 --> 05:06.361
Second thought... throw
this party the night a war ends.

05:06.430 --> 05:07.896
We're kind of locked for this Saturday.

05:07.998 --> 05:10.098
After I got back from the Pacific,

05:10.200 --> 05:11.967
I kissed a thousand nurses.

05:12.069 --> 05:13.068
That seems like too many.

05:14.171 --> 05:15.937
Crap. The guys are here!

05:16.039 --> 05:18.206
Thank you for your fun ideas.
We'll let you know.

05:18.308 --> 05:19.574
Are you sending me away?

05:19.676 --> 05:21.510
I just need you to step
into a different room

05:21.578 --> 05:22.744
for, say, an hour.

05:22.846 --> 05:25.347
I could pop down for
some of your mom's monkey bread.

05:25.415 --> 05:27.516
I don't need the details. Bye.

05:29.052 --> 05:30.018
There they are.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.587
Well, welcome to party plan central.

05:32.689 --> 05:34.523
Is it too late to discuss
alternate venues?

05:34.625 --> 05:36.791
Yep. Let's plan this beast,

05:36.860 --> 05:40.061
keeping in mind we need this
party to be cool and inviting

05:40.164 --> 05:43.365
to redheaded 17-year-old girls
who I know play volleyball.

05:43.467 --> 05:44.399
I'll start.

05:44.501 --> 05:45.634
A volleyball.

05:45.736 --> 05:49.104
Here's something fun... BYOB,
"bring your own broom."

05:49.206 --> 05:50.906
My turn. 50 kegs.

05:51.008 --> 05:52.641
Giant speakers that will
blow out car windows.

05:52.666 --> 05:53.608
A party donkey.

05:53.677 --> 05:54.910
A no-rules foam room

05:54.978 --> 05:56.845
and a giant fish tank
full of hammerheads.

05:56.914 --> 05:58.880
Disposable shoe covers,
like at an open house.

05:58.982 --> 06:01.449
Ooh! How about a roped-off private area

06:01.518 --> 06:03.618
where two people can talk
and get to know each other?

06:03.687 --> 06:04.920
Yes! A rope! Put that down.

06:05.022 --> 06:06.588
We're humming now! Anyone else?

06:06.690 --> 06:08.056
How 'bout an oyster bar?

06:08.125 --> 06:09.090
What are you doing here?

06:09.159 --> 06:10.258
Making suggestions

06:10.327 --> 06:12.594
to get some enchantment
back in this party.

06:12.629 --> 06:13.628
What's with the old guy?

06:13.697 --> 06:15.297
And why is he suggesting sea vomit?

06:15.365 --> 06:18.099
Question... what's
the sexiest instrument?

06:18.202 --> 06:19.868
Answer? The oboe!

06:19.970 --> 06:21.403
Pops, I don't need your help.

06:21.471 --> 06:22.971
But if you want romance,

06:23.040 --> 06:25.540
your pals are steering you
toward disaster.

06:25.642 --> 06:26.608
I know what I'm doing!

06:26.710 --> 06:28.810
Doesn't mean you don't need my advice.

06:28.879 --> 06:30.912
- Pops!
- Here's some more gold.

06:30.981 --> 06:34.115
Turn up the temperature
and watch the girls glisten.

06:34.184 --> 06:36.885
I need this party to be cool,
not sweaty.

06:36.954 --> 06:39.187
And oboes and clams aren't cool.

06:39.289 --> 06:40.288
Oysters!

06:40.324 --> 06:42.123
Why would you have clams at a party?

06:42.226 --> 06:44.526
Enough! I don't need your help.

06:44.595 --> 06:47.829
I'll let my oboe guy know
you won't be in touch.

06:47.931 --> 06:49.364
<i>As I left Pops feeling empty,</i>

06:49.466 --> 06:52.200
<i>my mom's cookbook signing
was a full house!</i>

06:52.269 --> 06:54.269
Mr. Whitby, can you
believe this turnout?

06:54.338 --> 06:56.571
Oh! I hope my pen
doesn't run out of ink.

06:56.640 --> 06:58.273
Well, just don't ask to borrow mine.

06:58.342 --> 07:01.042
It hasn't worked since I used it
to perform a tracheotomy

07:01.111 --> 07:04.012
on a man who, long story short,
didn't need one.

07:04.047 --> 07:06.047
Anyway, good luck with the reading.

07:06.116 --> 07:07.749
Reading? I thought
this was just a signing.

07:07.784 --> 07:09.384
Oh, no. You'll be reading.

07:09.453 --> 07:11.920
Well, I suppose
if my adoring fans demand it...

07:11.955 --> 07:14.155
<i>Whether they did or they just
happened to be in the store,</i>

07:14.224 --> 07:16.458
<i>they got to witness maybe the first-ever</i>

07:16.526 --> 07:17.891
<i>dramatic reading of a cookbook.</i>

07:17.992 --> 07:19.561
"1/2 cup cream.

07:19.630 --> 07:22.219
Two sticks of butter, cubed.

07:22.305 --> 07:25.600
Toss into margarine until combined"!

07:25.669 --> 07:28.303
<i>And once my mom got going,
she didn't want to stop...</i>

07:28.372 --> 07:31.539
"Whisk gently with water
until the clumps...

07:31.608 --> 07:33.141
have dissipated."

07:33.243 --> 07:34.976
<i>...or stay totally on topic.</i>

07:35.012 --> 07:37.112
You know, I like to think I do for Parm

07:37.180 --> 07:39.648
what Madam Curie did for, uh...

07:39.750 --> 07:41.049
well, whatever it is she did.

07:41.151 --> 07:42.484
Should we be worried Mom won't handle

07:42.586 --> 07:44.119
all this attention in a positive way?

07:44.221 --> 07:45.553
Nah. She'll be fine.

07:45.656 --> 07:48.056
I have a husband and three children,

07:48.125 --> 07:51.860
and yet, today, my life began!

07:51.962 --> 07:53.762
<i>While my mom embraced cookbook fame,</i>

07:53.830 --> 07:56.538
<i>I was bracing for
the party of a lifetime.</i>

07:56.624 --> 07:57.732
Thanks for picking me up, Johnny.

07:57.801 --> 08:00.168
Eh, it's the least I could do
after you bought all those kegs.

08:00.270 --> 08:01.670
Kegs? What are you talking about?

08:01.738 --> 08:03.605
You know, that money you left
for me in that envelope

08:03.674 --> 08:04.939
in that drawer in your room.

08:04.964 --> 08:06.018
What?!

08:06.043 --> 08:07.876
My Garbage Pail Kids emergency fund?!

08:07.978 --> 08:10.278
Honestly, who's worse... me or you?

08:10.328 --> 08:11.379
Fine!

08:11.481 --> 08:13.081
It'll all be worth it when I wow Brea

08:13.183 --> 08:15.150
with these sweet Z. Cavaricci pants.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.237
I'm not so sure.

08:16.320 --> 08:17.886
Is she into little nervous pirates?

08:17.988 --> 08:19.087
Doesn't matter,

08:19.189 --> 08:20.989
as long as Brea shows
and we share a moment.

08:21.091 --> 08:23.692
So, your plan is
to wear lady pants to a party

08:23.794 --> 08:25.393
in the hopes of spending a quiet moment

08:25.495 --> 08:26.995
with a girl way out of your league?

08:27.097 --> 08:28.797
Admittedly, the plan has wrinkles.

08:28.899 --> 08:30.031
And here's some more wrinkles...

08:30.100 --> 08:31.700
on that old dude from your bedroom.

08:32.803 --> 08:33.868
Pops?

08:33.970 --> 08:35.236
Hey, kiddo.

08:35.339 --> 08:38.807
I heard what you said
the other day loud and clear.

08:38.909 --> 08:40.775
Then why are you here
with that rolling battleship?

08:40.876 --> 08:43.244
I thought you'd want
to take it to your party.

08:43.347 --> 08:45.013
When you roll up with this baby,

08:45.115 --> 08:47.449
you'll be fighting trixies off
with a stick.

08:47.551 --> 08:49.217
You certainly know
what a modern boy wants,

08:49.319 --> 08:50.919
but you're not even
supposed to be driving.

08:51.021 --> 08:52.821
Enjoy the Caddy.

08:52.923 --> 08:54.089
I don't want the Caddy.

08:54.191 --> 08:55.924
You got to take the Caddy.

08:56.026 --> 08:58.827
Stop saying "Caddy," and stop
throwing Caddy keys at me.

08:58.929 --> 09:01.262
I know we had a rough patch
the other day,

09:01.365 --> 09:03.898
but let me do this for my best bud.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.134
I don't want this.
I don't want your help.

09:06.236 --> 09:07.335
I just want to be left alone.

09:07.437 --> 09:09.738
Okay, then. I get it.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.673
You don't want me.

09:13.076 --> 09:15.076
Oof. That was rough.

09:15.178 --> 09:16.745
Hope you have the same presence of mind

09:16.847 --> 09:18.654
when Paula Abdul demands her pants back.

09:19.469 --> 09:22.669
<i>Dave Kim's party was in
full swing and off the chain.</i>

09:22.748 --> 09:25.161
<i>The place was packed,
the music was bumpin',</i>

09:25.248 --> 09:26.419
<i>the shots jello'd,</i>

09:26.505 --> 09:27.795
<i>and that guy was shirtless.</i>

09:27.881 --> 09:29.116
<i>This night was gonna be epic!</i>

09:29.185 --> 09:32.353
Nice. Dave Kim is quite the host.

09:32.421 --> 09:34.928
I'm gonna take a shower in the
master and get my night started.

09:34.983 --> 09:37.698
<i>The only thing missing was
a certain special lady.</i>

09:37.793 --> 09:39.260
This is officially a cool party!

09:39.362 --> 09:40.881
Why isn't Brea here, Dave Kim?

09:41.006 --> 09:42.930
Dude, I've got
my own problems right now.

09:42.965 --> 09:45.733
Carla is playing a drinking game
with my baby pictures!

09:45.790 --> 09:48.469
Look at you holding the football
like you know how it works.

09:48.571 --> 09:49.670
That's not all.

09:49.739 --> 09:51.772
Those guys are wearing
Villanova sweatshirts,

09:51.841 --> 09:53.207
and based on their facial hair

09:53.242 --> 09:55.509
and nonstop references
to beating Georgetown,

09:55.578 --> 09:57.211
I think they actually go there.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.912
I hope your parents have
earthquake insurance,

09:58.981 --> 10:01.949
'cause this party's gonna be rockin'!

10:02.018 --> 10:03.494
They have fire and flood,

10:03.552 --> 10:05.953
but their deductible is super-high!

10:06.021 --> 10:07.821
As the person who started this party,

10:07.890 --> 10:09.590
you need to do something.

10:09.625 --> 10:11.191
Or we wait until Brea shows.

10:11.260 --> 10:14.027
Yo. Someone popped
your parents' water bed.

10:14.096 --> 10:16.497
Seems... time-sensitive.

10:16.565 --> 10:18.432
That's as good a sign as any.

10:18.534 --> 10:20.134
Attention, friends.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.002
This party is...

10:22.037 --> 10:23.306
<i>But in that moment,</i>

10:23.330 --> 10:25.025
<i>Brea Bee was in the house...</i>

10:25.056 --> 10:27.107
<i>...and all reasonable thinking
went out the window.</i>

10:27.176 --> 10:29.076
...the best party evah!

10:32.648 --> 10:33.947
Brea! Hey.

10:33.983 --> 10:36.250
Wow. There's... so much going on.

10:36.318 --> 10:37.518
How did you even get in those?

10:37.586 --> 10:39.086
One leg at a time, baby.

10:39.188 --> 10:41.488
Then my mom has to latch
all my buckles in back.

10:41.590 --> 10:43.223
- What's your poison?
- I'd take some water.

10:43.325 --> 10:45.159
Hydration. Nice.

10:45.194 --> 10:46.627
Your body thanks you.

10:46.695 --> 10:48.362
Well, I-I didn't mean
to talk about your body.

10:48.431 --> 10:50.364
I mean, you look lovely.

10:50.433 --> 10:51.598
Probably 'cause of all that water.

10:51.700 --> 10:53.467
Circled back. Saved it.

10:53.536 --> 10:54.902
Okay.

10:56.472 --> 10:57.638
What am I doing?!

10:57.706 --> 10:58.859
I'm blowing it!

10:58.884 --> 10:59.950
I'm sorry!

10:59.975 --> 11:02.276
Is your romantic plan
to destroy my house

11:02.344 --> 11:03.644
not coming to fruition?

11:03.712 --> 11:07.681
Maybe you can let me free
and we can talk more about it!

11:07.750 --> 11:09.716
<i>While Dave Kim's party
was getting out of hand,</i>

11:09.785 --> 11:12.152
<i>so was my mom's grasp on reality.</i>

11:12.221 --> 11:15.189
Do I smell Mom's
homemade chili cheese lasagna?

11:15.291 --> 11:16.557
Yes, you do, Schmoo.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.592
My biggest fear used to be
that I'd turn into my mom.

11:18.661 --> 11:19.993
Well, I've been using your mom's recipes

11:20.062 --> 11:21.295
and having the time of my life.

11:21.363 --> 11:23.330
We are two very different men.

11:23.399 --> 11:25.199
Hello, BevHeads.

11:25.267 --> 11:26.800
That's the new moniker I've given

11:26.869 --> 11:28.769
my legions of adoring fans.

11:28.804 --> 11:30.504
- What fans?
- And why are you dressed like

11:30.573 --> 11:32.005
Melanie Griffith in "Working Girl"?

11:32.107 --> 11:34.641
Those two questions
have the same answer...

11:34.710 --> 11:36.410
stardom.

11:36.479 --> 11:38.045
<i>Mornin', Jenkintown!</i>

11:38.113 --> 11:40.113
<i>- That's Matt.
- And that's Lizzie.</i>

11:40.149 --> 11:42.716
<i>And we're here with cookbook author</i>

11:42.751 --> 11:46.386
<i>and local celebrity Beverly Goldberg!</i>

11:46.489 --> 11:47.955
Oh, look! You're on TV!

11:48.023 --> 11:49.623
We can finally control your volume.

11:49.692 --> 11:52.292
And she's with Lizzie, the human
cup of coffee that starts my day.

11:52.361 --> 11:54.995
<i>So, what's next for Beverly Goldberg?</i>

11:55.064 --> 11:57.197
I am just gonna ride
the wild success of my book

11:57.299 --> 11:59.833
into, eh, housewares, beef, bikes,

11:59.902 --> 12:02.669
tax assistants, music,
children's clothing,

12:02.738 --> 12:04.505
tiny, little scissors, bric-a-brac,

12:04.573 --> 12:06.273
Dutch ovens, TV shows.

12:06.342 --> 12:07.641
I guess we'd better watch our backs.

12:08.711 --> 12:09.676
Matt, look at me.

12:09.778 --> 12:11.311
Look at all of this. It will be gone.

12:11.380 --> 12:12.980
Even Lizzie's gonna leave you.

12:13.082 --> 12:14.147
Oh, we're not together.

12:14.250 --> 12:15.349
Shut up, Lizzie.

12:15.451 --> 12:17.017
We've all seen how you touch his arm.

12:19.121 --> 12:20.053
Why would they air this?

12:20.155 --> 12:22.289
Again... stardom!

12:22.358 --> 12:23.991
<i>And things only got worse from there.</i>

12:24.093 --> 12:26.093
Lady, you can't park there.

12:26.195 --> 12:27.261
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

12:27.329 --> 12:28.929
No, it's okay. Famous author.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.298
<i>Yeah, after one
successful local book signing,</i>

12:31.367 --> 12:33.000
<i>my mom became a monster.</i>

12:33.068 --> 12:34.935
Hey! Your dog just did
his business on my lawn!

12:35.037 --> 12:36.036
You gonna pick that up?

12:36.138 --> 12:37.638
Oh, I don't do that anymore.

12:37.706 --> 12:39.172
But here.

12:39.225 --> 12:41.879
<i>A real nightmare who thought
the rules didn't apply to her.</i>

12:41.973 --> 12:43.710
Sorry. Fame doesn't wait in line.

12:43.812 --> 12:45.045
Uh, do you mind?

12:45.147 --> 12:46.346
Okay, just one.

12:46.415 --> 12:48.515
<i>In her mind, she was
The Beatles of cooking.</i>

12:48.584 --> 12:49.816
Okay, this is for all of you.

12:49.919 --> 12:51.585
<i>And there was no slowing her down.</i>

12:51.654 --> 12:52.853
Whoo-hoo!

12:52.922 --> 12:55.989
Bookbinder's on a Saturday night
with no reservations.

12:56.091 --> 12:57.024
You really did it, Bevy.

12:57.092 --> 12:58.225
Remember, when we're in public,

12:58.294 --> 12:59.893
it's Brittley Divine.

12:59.962 --> 13:01.795
I'm sorry... this table's reserved.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.230
Uh, for celebs, yes.

13:03.299 --> 13:04.431
For this party of four.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.199
There's a waiting list.
It's about two hours.

13:06.302 --> 13:07.868
I thought you said
you had a standing table

13:07.937 --> 13:09.336
with complimentary appetizers.

13:09.405 --> 13:12.606
I was gonna order two of
everything, Noah's Ark-style.

13:12.675 --> 13:14.841
All right, hand over the menus.
We're not going anywhere.

13:14.910 --> 13:16.543
I am, 'cause this is mortifying.

13:16.612 --> 13:18.111
I guess you've left me no choice.

13:20.316 --> 13:22.015
It's me. All right?

13:22.084 --> 13:24.251
Now, be a dear
and go get us three iced teas

13:24.353 --> 13:26.553
and maybe turn the lights down
in this section,

13:26.622 --> 13:28.655
because people are starting to stare!

13:28.724 --> 13:31.925
They're staring at you
because you're a nightmare.

13:32.027 --> 13:34.261
I'm going across the street
to Long John Silver's.

13:34.330 --> 13:37.264
I didn't realize we were
so close to fried pirate fish.

13:37.333 --> 13:39.633
Sit down, Barry.
We are eating here for free.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.268
Clearly, this woman is very embarrassed

13:41.337 --> 13:42.936
and she'll do anything to make it right.

13:43.038 --> 13:44.137
I'm calling the police.

13:44.239 --> 13:45.973
<i>While my mom's ego was out of control,</i>

13:46.108 --> 13:47.741
<i>so was Dave Kim's party.</i>

13:47.843 --> 13:48.909
There you are!

13:48.978 --> 13:50.277
Took me a while to get that water

13:50.312 --> 13:52.112
because someone ripped
the faucet off the sink.

13:52.214 --> 13:53.146
Oh. Thanks.

13:53.215 --> 13:54.648
But I'm just gonna get out of here.

13:54.717 --> 13:56.383
What? The party's just getting started!

13:56.485 --> 13:58.318
Started? My mailman is in the kitchen,

13:58.420 --> 14:00.087
screaming that he wants
someone to punch him.

14:00.155 --> 14:01.421
What if I could calm this place down?

14:01.490 --> 14:03.423
- How are you gonna do that?
- With this!

14:03.525 --> 14:04.825
People are always too embarrassed

14:04.927 --> 14:06.827
to do stupid stuff in front of a camera.

14:06.895 --> 14:08.462
<i>Turns out that wasn't the case.</i>

14:08.564 --> 14:10.597
Hey, world, check me out!

14:10.699 --> 14:13.300
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

14:14.570 --> 14:16.169
I will never regret this!

14:16.238 --> 14:17.871
Furniture Jenga rules!

14:17.940 --> 14:19.172
Whooooooa!

14:21.176 --> 14:22.275
Stack 'em again.

14:22.378 --> 14:24.111
I'm bleeding, but I can go higher.

14:24.179 --> 14:26.980
Stop stealing!
That's the Kim family microwave.

14:27.082 --> 14:28.582
I have you on film!

14:28.684 --> 14:30.017
Mine.

14:30.052 --> 14:32.052
I'm not sure the camera worked
like you thought it would.

14:33.322 --> 14:36.323
My mom's Franklin Mint
commemorative plate collection!

14:36.392 --> 14:37.671
Those are worth a fortune

14:37.749 --> 14:38.905
or possibly nothing!

14:38.961 --> 14:40.794
Follow me to safety!

14:40.863 --> 14:43.630
What are you doing in
our hiding spot, Johnny Atkins?

14:43.655 --> 14:44.577
Just takin' a breather.

14:44.602 --> 14:47.234
- It's pretty rough out there.
- Johnny Atkins is afraid?!

14:47.302 --> 14:49.236
If he can't handle this, no one can!

14:49.304 --> 14:50.470
I say we throw "Goldnerd" out there.

14:50.539 --> 14:51.905
They'll swarm him,
and we'll make our getaway.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.974
Ugh! Why didn't I leave?!

14:54.076 --> 14:55.108
I'm scared.

14:55.210 --> 14:56.343
<i>In that moment, I knew</i>

14:56.412 --> 14:58.445
<i>this was my chance
to prove myself to Brea.</i>

14:58.514 --> 14:59.946
I'm gonna make a phone call.

15:00.015 --> 15:01.481
<i>As I was calling in reinforcements,</i>

15:01.550 --> 15:03.317
<i>my mom was about to be called out.</i>

15:03.419 --> 15:04.551
What's all this?

15:04.653 --> 15:06.386
You told me Barbara Walters was coming

15:06.455 --> 15:09.022
to interview me about my book
and my cosmetics line.

15:09.058 --> 15:10.883
No, that's a super-obvious lie,

15:10.954 --> 15:12.125
and the fact that you believed it

15:12.194 --> 15:14.227
suggests how out of touch
with reality you are.

15:14.274 --> 15:15.295
So she's running late?

15:15.397 --> 15:16.496
Bevy...

15:16.598 --> 15:17.898
...this is an intervention.

15:17.966 --> 15:21.001
Oh, no. Is Barry
back on Strawberry Quik again?

15:21.070 --> 15:22.936
I can quit whenever I want.

15:23.038 --> 15:24.337
This intervention is for you.

15:24.406 --> 15:25.706
Me? What's my problem?

15:25.808 --> 15:27.441
You've become an embarrassing psycho.

15:27.543 --> 15:28.742
Cookie break!

15:28.844 --> 15:30.343
I'm a psycho?

15:30.412 --> 15:32.212
Your boyfriend is dressed as me.

15:32.314 --> 15:33.313
And I'm pulling it off.

15:34.083 --> 15:35.048
And I'm... pulling it off.

15:35.150 --> 15:36.983
Since this whole book thing started,

15:37.052 --> 15:39.219
you've been shameful,
rude, and dismissive.

15:39.321 --> 15:41.421
And I want nothing more
than to live a life

15:41.523 --> 15:43.444
of unearned celebrity excess,

15:43.530 --> 15:45.741
but right now,
you're being total garbage.

15:45.819 --> 15:48.495
I see. I had no idea
me fulfilling my dreams

15:48.564 --> 15:51.131
was gonna cause you
so much pain and jealousy.

15:51.233 --> 15:53.333
Jealousy? No one here is saying that.

15:53.435 --> 15:54.534
You didn't have to.

15:54.636 --> 15:56.970
It's all over your faces,
like Strawberry Quik!

15:57.072 --> 15:58.605
I only do it on the weekends!

15:58.707 --> 16:01.441
Okay, I'm gonna go spend time
with my real family...

16:01.543 --> 16:04.478
my fans at the book expo downtown.

16:04.580 --> 16:05.645
Can you hear yourself?

16:05.748 --> 16:07.814
Not above the roar of my adoring crowd.

16:07.916 --> 16:11.017
The BevHeads are gonna be
lined up around the block!

16:13.388 --> 16:14.970
Where are all my BevHeads?

16:15.048 --> 16:16.723
BevHeads?

16:16.825 --> 16:19.626
Your book was a minor local success,

16:19.728 --> 16:22.162
and only because your friends
and family supported you.

16:22.264 --> 16:23.864
But you knew that.

16:23.966 --> 16:24.998
I did not.

16:25.100 --> 16:26.600
That's hilarious.

16:26.702 --> 16:29.684
Well, I've got a pregnant
Great Dane in the car.

16:33.889 --> 16:36.097
<i>The party had trashed Dave Kim's house,</i>

16:36.175 --> 16:37.980
<i>and now it was taking to the streets.</i>

16:38.098 --> 16:39.980
They're taking our pillows, man!

16:40.066 --> 16:42.529
Why?! Why?!!

16:42.608 --> 16:44.241
It's best we don't know.

16:44.309 --> 16:46.309
<i>As hope... and Dave Kim's belongings...</i>

16:46.412 --> 16:47.778
<i>disappeared into the night,</i>

16:47.846 --> 16:49.946
<i>a friendly face showed up just in time.</i>

16:50.015 --> 16:52.082
<i>No, they weren't in slow motion,</i>

16:52.151 --> 16:54.518
<i>and yes, half had their
blinkers on for no reason,</i>

16:54.586 --> 16:56.086
<i>but that armada of Cadillacs</i>

16:56.155 --> 16:59.022
<i>was the most beautiful sight
I'd ever seen.</i>

16:59.091 --> 17:00.557
Thanks for doing this, Pops.

17:00.659 --> 17:02.159
And I brought reinforcements.

17:02.227 --> 17:03.727
Five Cadillacs should do it.

17:03.796 --> 17:05.561
Five? We started with seven.

17:05.631 --> 17:07.531
Where the hell are Bob and Diane?

17:07.598 --> 17:10.067
I'm sorry I told you
I don't want you around.

17:10.169 --> 17:11.134
That's not true.

17:11.236 --> 17:13.403
Aw, sometimes it might be.

17:13.472 --> 17:14.471
You're a young man.

17:14.540 --> 17:16.839
You don't need your Pops
cramping your style.

17:16.909 --> 17:17.874
I don't get it.

17:17.943 --> 17:19.972
How are you always so understanding?

17:20.079 --> 17:21.218
Hey.

17:21.313 --> 17:23.280
You're my best bud.

17:23.348 --> 17:25.515
I know what's in your heart.

17:27.886 --> 17:29.986
Yeah, me too, buddy.

17:30.022 --> 17:33.290
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a party to break up.

17:33.392 --> 17:35.358
Come on, everybody!

17:35.461 --> 17:36.573
Let's ride!

17:37.434 --> 17:38.762
<i>That night, Pops busted out</i>

17:38.864 --> 17:40.720
<i>the coolest party trick I'd ever seen.</i>

17:40.745 --> 17:41.862
Come on, come on.

17:41.933 --> 17:45.068
<i>He got a bunch of alte kakers
to make it crazy-uncool!</i>

17:45.137 --> 17:48.805
<i>There were puzzles, bingo,
pictures of grandkids,</i>

17:48.907 --> 17:50.841
<i>and plenty of butterscotch.</i>

17:50.909 --> 17:53.376
<i>And, man, did it
clear that party out fast.</i>

17:53.445 --> 17:55.341
We did it. We totally saved this house.

17:59.017 --> 18:00.183
That'll buff out.

18:00.219 --> 18:02.152
<i>As Pops saved the day, my mom discovered</i>

18:02.221 --> 18:04.321
<i>there was some interest
in her book after all.</i>

18:04.389 --> 18:05.355
Excuse me.

18:05.424 --> 18:07.691
Where could a BevHead
get their book signed?

18:07.760 --> 18:08.759
What are you doing here?

18:08.827 --> 18:10.961
I came to support my beautiful wife.

18:11.029 --> 18:12.829
Even after the way I acted?

18:12.931 --> 18:14.264
It wasn't your finest moment.

18:14.333 --> 18:15.699
I'm so sorry.

18:15.734 --> 18:18.702
I was just excited for you guys
to finally be proud of me.

18:18.771 --> 18:21.104
Are you kidding?
We're always proud of you.

18:21.173 --> 18:23.388
It's true, Mom.
And you got a book published.

18:23.413 --> 18:24.351
That's not nothing.

18:24.376 --> 18:25.876
Yeah, a book nobody cares about.

18:25.978 --> 18:27.244
We care about it.

18:27.279 --> 18:28.812
And isn't that what's important,

18:28.881 --> 18:30.981
not some stupid table at Bookbinder's?

18:31.016 --> 18:32.149
Here's the thing.

18:32.217 --> 18:34.117
You don't need the whole world
to love you,

18:34.186 --> 18:36.386
because you got
a world of love right here.

18:36.488 --> 18:37.687
Damn it, Murray!

18:37.756 --> 18:39.656
Why do you always say the perfect thing?

18:39.725 --> 18:41.391
Because you make it easy.

18:45.164 --> 18:47.898
Hey! All you book dopes!

18:47.966 --> 18:51.902
Come on over here! My wife wrote
an amazing cookbook!

18:54.873 --> 18:56.072
Brea.

18:56.141 --> 18:57.174
You're still here?

18:57.242 --> 18:58.275
Yeah.

18:58.310 --> 19:00.410
I think my friend left
on a motorized scooter.

19:01.747 --> 19:03.814
I can't believe I did this
to Dave Kim's house

19:03.916 --> 19:05.081
just to impress you.

19:05.184 --> 19:06.917
You ever consider just talking to me?

19:06.952 --> 19:07.984
Like that would work.

19:08.086 --> 19:09.286
Give it a shot.

19:09.311 --> 19:10.518
You might be surprised.

19:10.588 --> 19:12.656
Okeydokey, Smokey the Bear.

19:12.758 --> 19:13.890
Stop.

19:13.926 --> 19:16.993
Enough with the... weirdness.

19:17.095 --> 19:18.929
Just be yourself.

19:19.031 --> 19:20.864
Talk to me as a person.

19:20.933 --> 19:22.599
Got it.

19:22.701 --> 19:24.167
So...

19:25.637 --> 19:27.571
...you want to maybe...

19:27.639 --> 19:29.306
get some ice cream?

19:29.408 --> 19:30.607
Sure.

19:30.709 --> 19:32.375
You want to walk to Scoops?

19:32.477 --> 19:34.044
Or I could drive us.

19:34.112 --> 19:36.112
Whoa! That's an enormous car.

19:36.215 --> 19:37.781
Yep.

19:37.850 --> 19:40.221
Almost as big as the heart
of the guy who loaned it to me.

19:41.185 --> 19:43.587
<i>Turns out every story does have a hero.</i>

19:43.655 --> 19:45.388
<i>Sometimes they show up in the end.</i>

19:45.457 --> 19:47.557
<i>Sometimes they were there
from the beginning.</i>

19:47.626 --> 19:49.292
<i>That's the thing about the characters</i>

19:49.394 --> 19:51.428
<i>that fill the pages of our lives.</i>

19:51.496 --> 19:53.797
<i>They're always there to lift us up...</i>

19:53.899 --> 19:56.599
<i>and, in some cases,
bring us back down to Earth.</i>

19:57.006 --> 20:00.537
<i>And that can make
for a pretty sweet ending.</i>

20:03.809 --> 20:04.941
Today we are here

20:05.010 --> 20:07.685
with the turtleneck-wearing
legend himself, Dave Kim.

20:09.181 --> 20:11.047
So, was there really a Dave Kim party?

20:11.116 --> 20:14.718
Well, I had told one person that
my mom was traveling to Korea,

20:14.820 --> 20:17.320
and he told the whole football team.

20:17.389 --> 20:20.423
Somehow the whole football team
got invited to my party.

20:20.525 --> 20:22.392
<i>Anything else you want to say ruined?</i>

20:22.494 --> 20:23.526
<i>Any regrets?</i>

20:23.629 --> 20:25.362
<i>Uh, it's gonna, uh, show a bit.</i>

20:25.430 --> 20:27.264
What did your parents say
when they got home?

20:27.366 --> 20:29.266
To this day, I don't think
they even know about it.

20:29.334 --> 20:31.064
Your parents watch the show, don't they?

20:32.478 --> 20:35.415
Okay, book guy, buckle up,
'Cause I got a few ideas

20:35.493 --> 20:36.962
guaranteed to be best sellers.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.007
- Wow me.
- Think "The Shining,"

20:39.094 --> 20:41.309
but instead of the hotel,
it's the beach,

20:41.411 --> 20:44.346
- and instead of ghosts, it's hot chicks.
- Okay.

20:44.448 --> 20:46.150
You know how people
like the Bible, right?

20:46.175 --> 20:47.290
What if there was a sequel?

20:47.329 --> 20:48.337
I'm an atheist.

20:48.423 --> 20:50.323
<i>Dracula,</i> but a book.

20:50.392 --> 20:51.790
I have news for you.

20:51.826 --> 20:54.793
A book of poems that's been
hollowed out to hide nunchucks.

20:54.829 --> 20:57.130
My people will be in touch.

20:57.165 --> 20:58.431
And I'm far enough away now

20:58.466 --> 21:00.232
to tell you that that was a lie.
