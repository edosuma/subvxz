HERE AT HAWK RECORDS,

09:33.774 --> 09:37.444
I HAVE A FULL-TIME
PEST CONTROL DEPARTMENT.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.246
SO WHY DON'T YOU SEND JORDIN
OVER HERE

09:39.312 --> 09:40.648
TO RECORD HER SONG?

09:40.681 --> 09:43.817
AND THEN I'LL SEND MY GUY
TO GET MR. SKUNKIE.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.018
[laughs]

09:45.085 --> 09:46.854
- I WILL CATCH THE SKUNK,
HAWK,

09:46.920 --> 09:48.922
RECORD A MONSTER HIT
WITH JORDIN,

09:48.989 --> 09:51.058
AND THEN I'LL GET YOU BACK.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.060
- YOU'RE COVERED IN GLUE TRAPS,
AREN'T YOU?

09:53.126 --> 09:56.363
- CURSE YOU, HAWK!

09:56.429 --> 09:59.232
OH, COME ON!
OH!

10:01.468 --> 10:03.270
- OKAY, WISHING WELL,

10:03.336 --> 10:04.938
I'M RECORDING A NEW SONG TODAY,

10:05.005 --> 10:09.376
AND I NEED SOME GOOD LUCK.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.079
- TARGET IS SAFE.
NO BAD LUCK IN SIGHT.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.948
- WISHING WELLS
ARE NOTHING BUT GOOD LUCK.

10:16.483 --> 10:20.187
[hammer tapping]

10:20.253 --> 10:21.421
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:21.488 --> 10:22.990
- I'M LOOKING
FOR FOUR-LEAF CLOVERS.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.057
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:24.124 --> 10:26.694
- SETTING UP ANOTHER DATE
WITH JO.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.196
HEY, NOTHING CAN GO WRONG
WHEN YOU PLAY HORSESHOES, RIGHT?

10:29.262 --> 10:31.431
- GIVE ME THAT HORSESHOE.

10:31.498 --> 10:32.966
- NO, IT'S FOR MY DATE WITH JO!

10:33.033 --> 10:34.201
- LET ME--
I BROKE A MIRROR!

10:34.267 --> 10:35.568
SEVEN YEARS, MAN!

10:35.635 --> 10:36.569
- NO, STOP!

10:36.636 --> 10:38.571
- UPSIDE-DOWN HORSESHOE!

10:38.638 --> 10:39.673
- IT'S BAD LUCK!

10:39.740 --> 10:42.442
both: MOVE OUT!

10:42.509 --> 10:44.444
[all shouting]

10:44.511 --> 10:47.380
- DROP THE HORSESHOE!

10:47.447 --> 10:49.783
DROP IT!
- I WANT IT!

10:49.850 --> 10:52.285
[shouting continues]

10:52.352 --> 10:55.255
[whooshing]

10:57.624 --> 10:58.792
clang!
- [screams]

10:58.859 --> 11:02.462
- * OH-OH, OH-OH, OH *

11:02.529 --> 11:04.732
- MAYBE WE ARE BAD LUCK.
- YEAH.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.238
- WE KNOCKED JORDIN SPARKS
DOWN A WELL.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.239
- NOBODY PANIC.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.041
I'M SURE THAT JORDIN IS FINE.

11:14.107 --> 11:18.178
I WISH THAT JORDIN IS OKAY.

11:18.245 --> 11:19.179
- OW!

11:19.246 --> 11:20.547
- OH, SHE'S OKAY.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.015
- GUYS, IS THAT YOU?

11:22.082 --> 11:25.185
- UH, DON'T WORRY, JORDIN.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.620
YOU CAN COUNT ON US.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.189
HOW YOU DOING?
YOU GOOD?

11:29.256 --> 11:30.390
- I'M IN A WELL!

11:30.457 --> 11:32.159
- RIGHT.
THAT'S--YEAH.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.560
- WE HAVE TO CALL
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

11:33.626 --> 11:34.762
- WE CAN'T CALL ANYONE,

11:34.762 --> 11:36.163
OR GUSTAVO WILL FIND OUT
AND KILL US.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.130
- AND THINK WE'RE BAD LUCK.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.866
- WE ARE!

11:38.932 --> 11:40.200
- JORDIN!

11:40.267 --> 11:43.771
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
WE GOT A PLAN.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.172
GUYS, WHAT'S THE PLAN?

11:45.238 --> 11:46.606
- WE'RE GOING TO RESCUE HER.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.508
NOW, WHICH ONE
OF THE GOOD LUCK PATROL

11:48.575 --> 11:52.112
IS GOING DOWN THE HOLE?

11:52.179 --> 11:53.313
both: GOOD LUCK, KENDALL.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.082
- YEAH.
JUST LOWER ME DOWN.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.416
I'LL PUT THE ROPE AROUND JORDIN,

11:56.483 --> 11:58.919
AND THEN YOU PULL US BOTH UP.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.353
- HEY, A FOUR-LEAF CLOVER.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.688
- [yelps]

12:01.789 --> 12:03.390
[screaming]

12:03.456 --> 12:04.892
crash!

12:04.958 --> 12:07.294
[coughing]

12:07.360 --> 12:08.495
OH, HEY, JORDIN.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.563
WHAT'S UP?

12:10.630 --> 12:12.132
- WHAT'S UP?

12:12.199 --> 12:13.801
I GOT A SONG
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.068
I SLIPPED ON A BANANA PEEL.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.169
I GOT ATTACKED
BY A CAT.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.806
AND AGAIN, I'M IN A WELL!

12:18.839 --> 12:21.141
- HEY, GUYS.
HAS ANYONE SEEN KENDALL?

12:21.208 --> 12:22.342
- WHO'S KENDALL?
- NO.

12:22.409 --> 12:26.213
- HE'S NOT IN THE WELL.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.214
- KENDALL?

12:27.280 --> 12:28.215
IS THAT YOU?

12:28.281 --> 12:31.151
AND JORDIN?

12:31.218 --> 12:34.654
both:
IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.496
- IF THAT SKUNK SPRAYS,

12:43.563 --> 12:44.965
JORDIN WILL THINK
ROCQUE RECORDS STINKS

12:45.032 --> 12:45.999
AND GO TO HAWK.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.200
- DON'T PANIC.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.836
HAWK MAY HAVE
A FULL-TIME EXTERMINATOR,

12:48.836 --> 12:50.303
BUT I HAVE
A FULL-TIME FREIGHT TRAIN

12:50.370 --> 12:54.074
WITH THE LATEST
IN SKUNK-HUNTING TECHNOLOGIES.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.844
- DID SOMEONE NEED HELP
CATCHING A SKUNK?

12:56.910 --> 12:58.378
- A SKUNK PUPPET?

12:58.445 --> 13:00.180
- A GIRL SKUNK PUPPET.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.249
- YES, AND YOU
ARE GONNA WORK IT,

13:02.315 --> 13:05.853
BECAUSE FREIGHT TRAIN'S
GIRLY VOICE IS HORRIBLE.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.154
- [sighs]

13:07.220 --> 13:08.655
- NOW, YOU LURE HIM OUT,

13:08.721 --> 13:13.260
AND WE'RE GONNA
THROW THE BOX OVER HIM.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.261
- COME HERE, SKUNKIE.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.462
- OOH, TELL HIM YOU GOT

13:15.528 --> 13:17.297
SOME GREAT KIBBLE
BACK AT YOUR TREE TRUNK.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.299
- DON'T PUSH IT.

13:19.366 --> 13:22.369
COME HERE, SKUNKIE.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.104
IT'S WORKING.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.238
COME ON.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.174
JUST A LITTLE FURTHER.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.342
[gasps]

13:29.409 --> 13:30.377
- HE SEES US.

13:30.443 --> 13:31.344
- [hisses]

13:31.411 --> 13:33.146
- ABORT MISSION!

13:33.213 --> 13:36.616
[yelling]

13:36.683 --> 13:41.288
- JORDIN, I'M SURE LOGAN,
AKA THE BIG-TIME BRAIN,

13:41.354 --> 13:43.390
IS CONCOCTING
AN AMAZING RESCUE PLAN

13:43.456 --> 13:44.557
AS WE SPEAK.

13:44.624 --> 13:45.692
- [screaming]

13:45.758 --> 13:48.228
crash!

13:48.295 --> 13:50.063
- WHAT PLAN WAS THAT?

13:50.130 --> 13:52.966
- OH, I'M FINE.
THANK YOU.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.534
I WAS MEASURING
THE DIAMETER OF THE WELL

13:54.601 --> 13:55.735
TO FASHION
A CRUDE PULLEY SYSTEM

13:55.802 --> 13:57.938
WHEN I SLIPPED.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.206
- DON'T WORRY, JORDIN.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.441
JAMES AND I ARE ON THE CASE!

14:01.508 --> 14:02.609
- YOU CAN COUNT ON US.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.111
- [giggles]

14:04.177 --> 14:05.478
both: WE'RE GONNA BE HERE
AWHILE.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.615
- NOW, WE POUR SOME YEAST
AND FLOUR INTO THE HOLE

14:08.681 --> 14:11.818
AND BAKE IT AT 400 DEGREES
UNTIL EVERYBODY RISES.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.120
all: NO!

14:13.186 --> 14:14.922
- OR WE COULD TOSS DOWN
SOME POOL NOODLES,

14:14.922 --> 14:15.923
FILL THE HOLE WITH WATER,

14:15.989 --> 14:19.226
AND THEY'LL FLOAT TO THE TOP.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.327
[chime dings]

14:20.393 --> 14:21.461
- WAIT,
DID YOU JUST COME UP

14:21.528 --> 14:23.130
WITH AN INGENIOUS
WATER DISPLACEMENT PLAN?

14:23.196 --> 14:25.598
- AH, YEAH.

14:25.665 --> 14:26.934
- GO, GO.

14:27.000 --> 14:27.935
- OH.

14:28.001 --> 14:31.238
- JAMES, CATCH THE HOSE.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.540
- OH!
[screams]

14:33.606 --> 14:35.742
crash!

14:35.808 --> 14:38.511
[groans]

14:38.578 --> 14:41.014
MILLIONS OF LUCKY PENNIES!

14:41.081 --> 14:44.351
I'M SAVED!

14:44.417 --> 14:45.618
- WHAT HAVE I DONE?

14:45.685 --> 14:47.955
ALL MY FRIENDS
ARE ALL TRAPPED IN A WELL.

14:47.955 --> 14:51.124
THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING TO DO.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.026
[shrieks]

14:53.093 --> 14:54.962
crash!

14:58.465 --> 14:59.766
[together]
WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?

14:59.832 --> 15:01.701
- I WAS LONELY!

15:01.768 --> 15:03.336
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU MAY NOT MAKE

15:03.403 --> 15:07.975
YOUR RECORDING SESSION.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.209
- IT'S OKAY.

15:09.276 --> 15:12.245
I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT THE SONG,
ANYWAY.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.981
- I DIDN'T THINK
THE SONG WAS BAD.

15:13.981 --> 15:16.483
HOW DID IT GO AGAIN?

15:16.549 --> 15:18.986
* ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,
TO THE FIVE *

15:19.019 --> 15:20.753
- YEAH, YEAH, OH,
AND ADD SOME LAYERS TO IT.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.222
TRY IT AGAIN.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.124
- * ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,
TO THE FIVE *

15:24.191 --> 15:25.825
- * OOH, YEAH, YEAH *

15:25.892 --> 15:27.995
both: AND HARMONIES.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.862

15:36.103 --> 15:38.605
- * BABY, I'M COUNTING ON YOU *

15:38.671 --> 15:42.409
- * ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,
TO THE FIVE *

15:42.475 --> 15:45.712
all: * BABY,
I'M COUNTING ON YOU *

15:45.778 --> 15:47.114
- * YEAH *

15:47.180 --> 15:48.481
[laughter]

15:48.548 --> 15:50.283
- GUYS, YOU JUST HELPED ME
FIGURE OUT THE SONG.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.152
NOW YOU GOT TO GET ME
OUT OF HERE.

15:52.219 --> 15:54.021
- WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE GUY
I KNOW

15:54.021 --> 15:56.656
THAT CAN PULL FIVE PEOPLE
OUT OF A WELL.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.428
- OKAY, L.A. SKUNKS
LOVE TWO THINGS:

16:01.494 --> 16:04.231
HOT LADIES
AND HOT CARS.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.299
NOW...

16:06.366 --> 16:09.436
HOT LADY SKUNK DRIVES OVER
TO MR. SKUNKIE,

16:09.502 --> 16:10.903
WHO HOPS IN,

16:11.038 --> 16:12.805
THINKING THAT THEY'RE GOING
TO A DANCE CLUB

16:12.872 --> 16:14.574
OR TO MAKE OUT POINT.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.110
THEN I DRIVE THEM OUT OF HERE
AND INTO THE STREET,

16:17.177 --> 16:18.045
AND--
[cell phone rings]

16:18.078 --> 16:19.112

16:19.179 --> 16:20.913
- HELLO?
IT'S KENDALL.

16:21.048 --> 16:23.250
HE SAID THEY KNOCKED
JORDIN SPARKS DOWN A WELL

16:23.316 --> 16:26.153
AND NEED ME
TO GET THEM OUT.

16:26.219 --> 16:30.123
- DON'T SCARE HIM,
OR HE'LL SPRAY.

16:30.190 --> 16:33.426
- GET THE DOGS HERE
SO I CAN KILL THEM

16:33.493 --> 16:36.429
AND THEN RECORD
JORDIN'S SONG.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.930
- OH, LOOK.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.533
- HEY, IT LOOKS LIKE
GUSTAVO ROCQUE'S LUCK

16:40.600 --> 16:43.370
IS FINALLY CHANGING.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.607
WHY--WAIT.
WHY--WHY ISN'T IT TURNING?

WHY ISN'T IT--
WHY ISN'T IT TURNING?

16:49.109 --> 16:50.143
- I THINK WE'RE OUT OF RANGE.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.111
- WHAT?
UH-UH.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.179

16:52.245 --> 16:53.946
- OH.
OH, HE LOOKS ANGRY.

16:54.081 --> 16:54.981

17:10.097 --> 17:11.131
- THAT HURT, THOUGH.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.365
- AHA!

17:12.432 --> 17:14.434
JORDIN SPARKS
PULLED OUT OF A WELL

17:14.501 --> 17:15.902
TIED TO FOUR LOSERS.

17:15.968 --> 17:16.903
I'LL BE RICH.

GUSTAVO ISN'T HAPPY.

17:26.313 --> 17:27.680
HE KNOWS ABOUT THE WELL,

17:27.747 --> 17:28.915
AND HE HAS A SKUNK
IN HIS STUDIO

17:28.981 --> 17:30.317
THAT HE CAN'T GET RID OF.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.819

OF A SKUNK?

17:32.885 --> 17:34.321
[skunk hissing]

17:34.387 --> 17:37.157

18:12.225 --> 18:13.593

18:13.660 --> 18:15.962
- WE CATCH STUFF ALL THE TIME
IN MINNESOTA.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.830
- YEAH, WHAT DID YOU USE
AS BAIT,

18:17.897 --> 18:19.299
A LADY SKUNK PUPPET?

18:19.366 --> 18:21.201
[laughter]

18:21.268 --> 18:23.603
both: WHAT?
NO.

18:25.305 --> 18:28.641

SKUNKY EVENTS,

18:28.708 --> 18:31.944
I HAVE DECIDED NOT TO KILL YOU.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.280
[sighing]

18:33.346 --> 18:36.916
HOWEVER, YOU BLATANTLY
DISREGARDED MY ORDERS

18:36.983 --> 18:38.985
TO STAY AWAY FROM
JORDIN SPARKS

18:39.051 --> 18:44.191
AND PROVED ONCE AGAIN
YOU ARE BAD LUCK RUSH.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.893
- GUSTAVO,
THEY'RE NOT BAD LUCK.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.195
THEY'RE GOOD LUCK.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.330
- UM, THEY KNOCKED YOU DOWN
A WELL.

18:50.397 --> 18:52.064
- YEAH, BUT IF I HADN'T
FALLEN DOWN THE WELL,

18:52.199 --> 18:53.800
I WOULD HAVE NEVER FIGURED OUT
THE SONG.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.335
- THEY HELPED YOU
FIGURE OUT THE SONG?

18:55.402 --> 18:57.204
- YEAH, IT'S NOT A SOLO.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.471
IT'S A DUET.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.373
- [laughs]

19:00.440 --> 19:01.708

I'VE EVER HAD.

19:06.713 --> 19:10.550
[cheering]

19:10.617 --> 19:13.486

I FINALLY COULD ADORE *

19:58.030 --> 19:59.165
- * BUT SHE FAILED MY TEST *

19:59.266 --> 20:00.567
* GOT TO KNOW HER BETTER *

20:00.633 --> 20:03.270
* SAW I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE *

20:03.336 --> 20:05.438
both: * BUT I'M WILLING
TO PUT MY TRUST IN YOU *

20:05.505 --> 20:08.140

20:11.678 --> 20:12.979

20:13.045 --> 20:14.614
- * NO NUMBERS IN MY POCKET *

20:14.681 --> 20:15.948
- * NO *

20:16.015 --> 20:17.049
- * ANYTHING I'M DOING, GIRL *

20:30.997 --> 20:32.899
- * WHY WOULD I WANT
TO DO THAT? *
