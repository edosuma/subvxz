WEBVTT

01:05.396 --> 01:07.619
Jesus, Michael.

01:07.719 --> 01:10.702
You want to 'Gram
with the shrine?

01:10.801 --> 01:13.044
No, I'm, uh. I'm good.

01:18.410 --> 01:21.393
Well, Kathleen.

01:21.493 --> 01:23.535
Welcome to the life.
Mm-hmm.

01:24.375 --> 01:26.157
Hey, sweetheart.

01:26.256 --> 01:29.200
Kathleen, I'd love for you
to meet my wife, Ava.

01:29.300 --> 01:31.523
Ava, I'd like for you
to meet my mortal enemy,

01:31.623 --> 01:32.643
Kathleen Townsend.

01:32.744 --> 01:33.725
Kathleen.

01:33.825 --> 01:36.207
It is a pleasure
to finally meet you.

01:36.307 --> 01:39.891
Well, likewise. Likewise.

01:39.991 --> 01:43.094
Congratulations,
newlyweds.
Michael and Ava: Thank you.

01:43.194 --> 01:47.018
A May-December romance
really warms my heart.

01:47.118 --> 01:49.260
Aww, that's so sweet.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.343
And you look wonderful,
by the way.
Thank you.

01:51.443 --> 01:54.785
I think I recognise
that outfit from season six.

01:54.886 --> 01:58.710
Okay, well, I will leave
the two of you to catch up.

01:58.809 --> 02:00.812
Behave.

02:02.454 --> 02:04.396
Congratulations.

02:04.496 --> 02:05.637
Not bad.

02:05.737 --> 02:06.838
I mean, a year ago,

02:06.938 --> 02:09.040
you were doing
insurance commercials

02:09.140 --> 02:10.241
with talking beavers.

02:10.341 --> 02:12.343
And now, now you have
all this

02:13.184 --> 02:14.446
She have family money?

02:14.545 --> 02:17.889
Oh no. Ava is 100% self-made.

02:17.989 --> 02:21.413
She founded a discount
online brokerage for women--

02:21.513 --> 02:23.575
She Trade.

02:23.675 --> 02:26.137
So this is a treat.

02:26.237 --> 02:28.379
After three years radio silence.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.942
What is this?
Some kind of 12-Step thing?

02:31.042 --> 02:33.905
You're a rage-a-holic?
You here to make amends?

02:34.004 --> 02:35.105
No.

02:35.206 --> 02:37.709
This isn't easy for me, Michael.

02:37.809 --> 02:40.311
I know that we have hurt
each other in the past.

02:40.411 --> 02:44.235
I know that I have
hurt you terribly.

02:44.335 --> 02:46.617
But I have to ask you
for a favour.

02:47.298 --> 02:48.720
Uh-huh?

02:48.820 --> 02:52.544
I want you to do a play with me.

02:54.746 --> 02:57.288
What? It's one night only.
Regional theatre.

02:57.388 --> 02:58.930
Oh, but they have
very deep pockets.

02:59.030 --> 03:01.813
I think some of the donors are
big "Spooky" fans actually.

03:01.913 --> 03:04.175
They offered big money.

03:04.275 --> 03:05.737
What's the play?

03:05.837 --> 03:07.378
"The Ghosts of Pensacola."

03:07.478 --> 03:11.583
Ugh. Listen, even 30 years ago,
that mope-fest sucked.

03:11.683 --> 03:14.746
Those were the best reviews
of our career.

03:14.846 --> 03:15.787
It's a low bar.

03:15.887 --> 03:16.908
Michael, do you know

03:17.008 --> 03:18.990
that if you died tomorrow,

03:19.090 --> 03:20.712
you would be remembered

03:20.812 --> 03:22.594
for Spooky and the Cop.

03:22.694 --> 03:23.995
Well, that's great.

03:24.095 --> 03:26.397
That means I provided joy
to a lot of people.

03:26.497 --> 03:28.800
You are an artist.

03:28.900 --> 03:31.002
It rages in your blood.

03:31.102 --> 03:32.924
I know your soul.

03:33.024 --> 03:37.769
I remember what the fire
was like on that stage.

03:37.869 --> 03:39.531
Okay, I think you're
overselling it, darling.

03:39.631 --> 03:41.492
The primal connection we had

03:41.593 --> 03:43.214
before the success,

03:43.314 --> 03:46.097
before the feuds
and the tabloids.

03:46.197 --> 03:48.419
Oh yeah, and the
People Magazine interview

03:48.519 --> 03:50.261
where you implied
that I couldn't read.

03:50.361 --> 03:51.543
I said I was sorry.

03:51.643 --> 03:53.465
It's still on my Wikipedia page.

03:53.565 --> 03:56.266
There's a whole subheading.
"Illiteracy."

03:56.367 --> 03:59.270
Michael, I'm desperate.

03:59.370 --> 04:01.513
Please, I'm begging you.

04:01.613 --> 04:03.314
I will do anything you want.

04:03.414 --> 04:05.637
I will prostrate
myself publicly.

04:05.737 --> 04:08.399
But I need this.

04:08.499 --> 04:11.683
Do you know what it's like
for an actress of a certain age?

04:11.783 --> 04:14.005
You go from mum to senator

04:14.105 --> 04:16.087
to dementia patient.

04:16.187 --> 04:18.189
And, and I need the money.

04:21.031 --> 04:25.016
Well, I'm sorry, Kathleen.
The answer's no.

04:25.116 --> 04:26.538
Okay?

04:26.638 --> 04:28.660
But if you need some cash,
I could, I could ask Ava.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.762
Oh, fuck you!

04:32.764 --> 04:36.027
And fuck you, bitch.

04:36.127 --> 04:38.309
Fuckin' motherfuckers!

04:38.409 --> 04:40.391
Fuck!
Jesus Christ.

04:40.491 --> 04:41.953
Motherfucker!

04:42.053 --> 04:43.995
Oh God.

04:44.095 --> 04:47.398
Michael, I keep asking you
to keep your pills on you.

04:47.498 --> 04:48.959
What if I'm not here?

04:49.060 --> 04:50.161
Ava--
Your heart.

04:50.261 --> 04:51.322
It's just seeing Kathleen

04:51.422 --> 04:53.765
makes my blood pressure spike.

04:53.865 --> 04:56.227
I'll get a massage
from Jean Marc.

04:58.029 --> 05:00.031
- Darling.
- Mm?

05:00.712 --> 05:02.714
Perhaps you should reconsider.

05:04.235 --> 05:06.137
I worry.

05:06.237 --> 05:08.980
You know, my money, my career,

05:09.080 --> 05:11.322
all of... this.

05:12.563 --> 05:14.565
You miss the limelight.

05:16.848 --> 05:17.909
But with Kathleen?

05:18.009 --> 05:19.671
Oh, come on.

05:19.771 --> 05:22.033
It was 30 years ago.

05:22.132 --> 05:24.355
I'm sure you've both
grown since then.

05:24.455 --> 05:26.457
Hmm?

05:27.498 --> 05:31.042
You manipulating, lying shrew!

05:31.142 --> 05:33.725
Oh, grow up,
you're a kept man.

05:33.825 --> 05:36.648
You should be used to
taking direction from a woman.

05:36.748 --> 05:37.769
There is no way

05:37.869 --> 05:39.691
I'm letting you direct
this damn play!

05:39.791 --> 05:41.132
Whoops, I am.

05:41.232 --> 05:43.895
And you would have known that
had you read your contract

05:43.995 --> 05:45.656
or had someone read it to you.

05:45.757 --> 05:49.140
Oh, okay, great. I'm in hell!

05:49.240 --> 05:50.421
And get this dog off the stage

05:50.521 --> 05:52.063
before I kick it
for three points.

05:52.163 --> 05:53.584
Come here, Fosse.

05:53.685 --> 05:55.026
Um, could we possibly discuss

05:55.126 --> 05:56.908
my character's clubfoot
for just a moment?

05:57.007 --> 05:59.030
Because I would feel personally
a lot more comfortable

05:59.130 --> 06:01.031
if somebody from
the clubfoot community

06:01.132 --> 06:02.353
were advising.

06:02.453 --> 06:03.834
Oh God. Really?
Yeah.

06:03.935 --> 06:06.317
Just get out there
and hobble, honey.

06:06.417 --> 06:08.419
That's the lunch menu, sir.

06:10.341 --> 06:12.884
I'll have a club sandwich
with a side order of a gun.

06:12.984 --> 06:16.047
Um, uh, and also, Harry,
if it's not too much trouble,

06:16.147 --> 06:19.370
thanks, could you get me
a hibiscus tea, please?

06:19.470 --> 06:21.412
With milk.
Um, but not almond milk.

06:21.512 --> 06:22.734
I know people like it,
but I'm allergic

06:22.834 --> 06:24.896
to all tree nuts
and legumes, actually.

06:24.996 --> 06:27.378
Of course, you are.
Well, no, I am.

06:27.478 --> 06:29.020
So if those dog treats
are peanut-based,

06:29.120 --> 06:31.582
because they smell peanut-based
and they say
peanut butter on them,

06:31.682 --> 06:34.225
I could go into
anaphylactic shock actually.

06:34.325 --> 06:37.388
Hold on. What the fuck is that?

06:37.488 --> 06:38.830
What?

06:38.930 --> 06:41.031
That thing on your lap.

06:41.132 --> 06:43.134
What is it?

06:43.935 --> 06:46.197
My script?

06:46.297 --> 06:48.079
Would you like a representative

06:48.179 --> 06:51.683
of the off-book
community present?

06:51.783 --> 06:54.605
You know, this is not
a TikTok, baby.

06:54.705 --> 06:56.888
This is my stage!

06:56.988 --> 07:01.853
And you show up knowing
your goddamn lines.

07:01.953 --> 07:04.015
These fucking millennials.

07:04.115 --> 07:05.656
Don't worry. You're doing great.

07:05.757 --> 07:07.779
You've already lasted longer
than John Stamos.

07:07.879 --> 07:10.501
Where is my stage manager Bill?

07:10.601 --> 07:12.143
Phil.
Okay, Bill,

07:12.243 --> 07:14.425
we are going to run this play

07:14.525 --> 07:17.709
the exact same way
we did in 1991.

07:17.809 --> 07:21.031
The timing on my trapdoor exit

07:21.132 --> 07:22.353
at the finale

07:22.453 --> 07:25.957
must be exactly the same.

07:26.057 --> 07:29.040
Well, we don't do
trapdoor drops anymore.

07:29.140 --> 07:30.201
It, it isn't safe.

07:30.301 --> 07:32.203
There's a 15-foot drop down

07:32.303 --> 07:35.006
to a concrete floor underneath,
and union regulations state--

07:35.106 --> 07:40.011
Okay, I did that drop
every night for one year.

07:40.111 --> 07:42.533
Frank Rich
called it "effective."

07:42.632 --> 07:45.636
Okay, well, that was
a long time, uh, uh...

07:52.083 --> 07:54.205
Say the word "ago."

07:57.007 --> 07:59.010
Go ahead.

07:59.971 --> 08:02.593
I want you to.

08:02.693 --> 08:06.517
Um... I'll make it
as safe as I can.

08:06.617 --> 08:08.279
Don't knock yourself out, Phil.

08:08.379 --> 08:10.041
Okay, everyone, come on.

08:10.141 --> 08:13.404
We have four days
to make magic happen here.

08:13.504 --> 08:15.506
Places, everybody.

08:18.589 --> 08:19.450
Places.

08:36.205 --> 08:39.670
Okay, people, to review--

08:39.770 --> 08:43.473
Every time
a military jet flies over,

08:43.574 --> 08:47.117
I want everything
on this stage to shake.

08:47.218 --> 08:49.359
Shake! You got it. Everything.

08:49.459 --> 08:52.563
Crew Member: Yes, ma'am.
Now, on the third flyover,

08:52.663 --> 08:55.445
that is the cue
for Michael's monologue.

08:55.545 --> 08:57.407
If he can manage
to hit his mark.

08:57.507 --> 08:59.510
Is that big enough?
Can you see it?

09:00.271 --> 09:03.093
Okay. Now, Bill.

09:03.194 --> 09:06.217
Bill, I would like to run
through my monologue

09:06.317 --> 09:08.900
all the way till the end
till the trapdoor fall.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.501
It's Phil.

09:10.601 --> 09:13.304
Yeah, we're ready!
Everything's good!

09:13.404 --> 09:16.666
It was cold
in Pensacola that winter.

09:16.766 --> 09:18.990
Unnatural cold.

09:19.089 --> 09:23.713
Frost that comes too soon
and stays too long.

09:23.814 --> 09:25.555
Maybe forever.

09:25.656 --> 09:28.758
The mist rises up and...

09:28.858 --> 09:30.861
Don't move!

09:31.742 --> 09:37.288
The mist rises up
and covers your toes.

09:37.387 --> 09:39.390
Then you waste.

09:41.752 --> 09:43.253
The waves.

09:43.353 --> 09:47.178
They want to meet the clouds.

09:47.277 --> 09:50.339
The mother and child
reaching out...

09:50.440 --> 09:52.443
...for each other...

09:53.003 --> 09:55.867
Oh, goddamn you!

09:55.967 --> 09:59.069
What the hell...!
Hey, Kathleen.

09:59.170 --> 10:01.391
Why don't you grab me some
extra thousand island dressing

10:01.492 --> 10:02.793
while you're back there?

10:02.892 --> 10:04.354
Oh!

10:04.454 --> 10:06.776
Son of a bitch!
Mats work.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.281
Hey.
What?

10:11.382 --> 10:13.844
I almost broke my goddamn neck!

10:13.944 --> 10:16.727
I'm done. I'm out. I quit. Good.

10:16.827 --> 10:18.689
You walk out now,
you're on the hook

10:18.789 --> 10:21.892
for a $200,000 kill fee.

10:21.992 --> 10:24.454
So maybe you want to talk
to your wife about it first.

10:24.555 --> 10:26.257
The one who pays
your allowance.

10:26.357 --> 10:28.378
It's worth every penny!

10:28.478 --> 10:30.420
You know,
I'm not so sure,

10:30.521 --> 10:32.063
because I think if she knew

10:32.163 --> 10:35.106
about all your dalliances,
maybe not so much.

10:35.205 --> 10:38.069
Alright. You want some
mutually-assured destruction?

10:38.169 --> 10:39.349
Yeah.
I got you, baby.

10:39.449 --> 10:41.671
Bring it.
Because I'm working
on my memoirs,

10:41.771 --> 10:43.834
and I got
a whole chapter about...

10:43.934 --> 10:45.935
...Acapulco.

10:46.776 --> 10:48.439
You signed an NDA.

10:48.539 --> 10:52.163
Yeah, well, now I got NFs to G.

10:52.262 --> 10:53.762
Alright, I'll do your damn play,

10:53.863 --> 10:56.847
but I tell you this--
the doomsday clock is ticking.

10:56.947 --> 10:59.290
And when the curtains drop
on this play tonight,

10:59.390 --> 11:01.612
you can kiss
your career goodbye.

11:01.712 --> 11:04.295
You might want to check
your prenup.

11:04.395 --> 11:06.137
Because tomorrow,

11:06.237 --> 11:08.979
Ava is getting
a little info in the mail

11:09.079 --> 11:12.782
about Chyna with a "Y."

11:12.882 --> 11:14.885
I'm not bluffing.

11:15.366 --> 11:16.507
I know.

11:16.607 --> 11:18.608
You're not a good enough actor.

11:52.723 --> 11:55.266
Okay. Five minutes
to call, people. Five minutes.

11:55.366 --> 11:56.786
Found it.
Thank you.

11:56.887 --> 11:58.228
I got you
a seat right up front

11:58.329 --> 11:59.550
so I can see you.

11:59.650 --> 12:01.632
Lucky me.

12:01.732 --> 12:03.733
Break a leg.

12:04.694 --> 12:06.516
Ava. Ava darling.

12:06.617 --> 12:08.358
I just wanted to thank you.

12:08.459 --> 12:09.760
Sorry?

12:09.859 --> 12:12.443
Well, I know
that you convinced Michael

12:12.543 --> 12:15.085
to do the play with me, and...

12:15.185 --> 12:17.527
I just... thank you.

12:17.627 --> 12:19.689
Oh, Kathleen. Oh.

12:19.790 --> 12:22.733
No, see, I knew that
working with you would be

12:22.833 --> 12:26.016
such a fucking nightmare
that it would kill off

12:26.117 --> 12:27.897
Michael's silly
little acting bug

12:27.997 --> 12:30.781
once and for all, and voilà.

12:30.881 --> 12:33.184
So, thank you.

12:33.284 --> 12:35.286
Psycho.

12:40.611 --> 12:43.353
That bitch's teeth
don't even match.

12:43.454 --> 12:45.795
The fuck is going on here?

12:45.896 --> 12:47.198
Break a leg, Michael.
Oh!

12:47.298 --> 12:49.280
Better not let Kathleen
catch you with those.

12:49.380 --> 12:50.601
What is she going
to do, fire me?

12:50.700 --> 12:52.703
A man can dream.

12:54.824 --> 12:56.827
Brrrr!

13:13.043 --> 13:14.385
Tomcat?

13:14.484 --> 13:16.967
No, that's a Phantom.

13:18.209 --> 13:20.070
Don't know why they bother.

13:20.170 --> 13:23.434
They say our boys
will be home by Christmas.

13:23.534 --> 13:25.396
What are you afraid of?

13:25.496 --> 13:28.159
What will become of her?

13:28.258 --> 13:30.481
I'm afraid that, that she has

13:30.580 --> 13:34.165
too much of both
of us inside her.

13:34.265 --> 13:38.689
I'm afraid that she has
a gunmetal heart.

13:38.789 --> 13:40.790
Like you.

13:43.274 --> 13:46.617
Summer felt like winter

13:46.717 --> 13:48.539
felt like spring.

13:48.637 --> 13:50.540
Fucking hack!

13:50.641 --> 13:52.862
Pathetic excuse for a man.

13:52.963 --> 13:55.146
You ball-busting harpy.

13:55.246 --> 13:57.308
Ow. Ouch. Ouch.

13:57.407 --> 14:02.112
Goddamn son of
a fucking piece of shit.

14:02.213 --> 14:04.954
You washed-up has-been.

14:05.055 --> 14:07.438
You pathetic
preening prick!

14:07.538 --> 14:10.241
You are such a failure.

14:10.341 --> 14:11.801
You think you're an actress?

14:11.901 --> 14:12.803
You're a joke.

14:12.902 --> 14:17.007
A lying, philandering failure.

14:17.107 --> 14:19.290
The whole crew used
to laugh at you.

14:19.390 --> 14:21.332
Actress? More like hacktress.

14:21.431 --> 14:24.415
You impotent baby.

14:24.515 --> 14:27.637
How the fuck
did I put up with you
all these years?

14:30.841 --> 14:33.743
You shriveled prune.
Ah, ah!

14:33.843 --> 14:37.267
Not as shrivelled
as your tiny little dick!

14:37.367 --> 14:39.370
Asshole.

14:42.293 --> 14:45.015
You vain, backstabbing hack.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.661
What kind of god!

14:52.543 --> 14:54.545
Bobby.

14:54.905 --> 14:57.608
Bobby, I want my heart to soar.

14:57.708 --> 15:00.731
I will dance on your grave.

15:00.830 --> 15:02.833
I'll piss on your grave.

15:10.199 --> 15:13.103
It feels like
a storm is brewin'.

15:13.203 --> 15:15.286
Did you close
the windows, sweetheart?

15:19.410 --> 15:23.894
Oh baby. I saw the Crawford boy
down the supermarket today.

15:26.377 --> 15:28.378
He works at the base now.

15:34.385 --> 15:36.086
Stop it, Mama.
Stop what?

15:36.185 --> 15:40.330
Stop it! Just stop thinking
that any man would ever want me.

15:40.430 --> 15:43.733
Oh, no, I didn't say that
about your foot.

15:43.834 --> 15:45.935
No!
Oh no.

15:46.036 --> 15:50.140
They say that there are
two types of men in Pensacola:

15:50.240 --> 15:54.625
pilots, and the men
who keep 'em up in the air.

15:54.724 --> 15:57.788
And if you forget,
they'll remind you.

15:57.887 --> 16:00.631
Some folks say that that's why
they fly their jets so low.

16:00.731 --> 16:02.953
Make us spill
our morning coffee.

16:04.253 --> 16:07.318
Always looking up at the skies

16:07.418 --> 16:08.878
in fear.

16:08.978 --> 16:11.342
Just to keep us in our place.

16:18.068 --> 16:19.410
Look out!

16:22.752 --> 16:23.853
Michael!

16:23.954 --> 16:24.974
Ava.

16:25.074 --> 16:27.077
Shit.

16:32.161 --> 16:34.164
Ava! Ava!

16:36.646 --> 16:39.128
Oh, my God!

16:40.690 --> 16:42.693
Oh no!

16:45.976 --> 16:48.279
I think we've got
everything we need.

16:48.378 --> 16:51.161
And again,
I'm so sorry for your loss.

16:51.261 --> 16:52.242
Thank you.

16:52.343 --> 16:54.525
Oh, I'll give you guys
some privacy.

16:54.625 --> 16:57.007
I just want you to know that
"Spooky and the Cop"

16:57.107 --> 16:59.290
made me choose a career
in law enforcement.

16:59.390 --> 17:01.992
Thank you. I can't tell you
how many times I've heard that.

17:15.606 --> 17:19.209
That was the performance
of a lifetime.

17:20.210 --> 17:21.992
You did it, darling.

17:22.091 --> 17:23.634
We did it.

17:23.734 --> 17:24.835
We did it.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.366
Come on, you threw
a tip at a customer.

17:35.466 --> 17:36.527
You know what, it was a dime.

17:36.627 --> 17:37.808
And you ate someone's bacon.

17:37.908 --> 17:39.290
They were ignoring me.

17:39.389 --> 17:41.972
You are the worst waitress
I've ever had.

17:42.072 --> 17:44.214
And I ran a Cracker Barrel
in the Green Zone.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.056
That last part was unnecessary.

17:46.156 --> 17:47.858
But thank you for your service.

17:47.957 --> 17:50.620
Okay. God.

17:56.567 --> 17:58.549
Well, as firings go,

17:58.649 --> 17:59.909
hardly my best work.

18:00.010 --> 18:02.592
Not bad for a matinee.

18:02.693 --> 18:03.994
You happen to know anyplace else

18:04.094 --> 18:05.636
that's looking
for a subpar waitress

18:05.735 --> 18:09.039
that doesn't require paperwork
or references?

18:09.139 --> 18:12.623
Well, actually,
half hours, good tips.

18:13.504 --> 18:15.004
Mm, no benefits.

18:15.105 --> 18:16.966
Seasonal work,
so it pays cash.

18:17.067 --> 18:19.889
I can put in a good word
for you if you're interested.

18:19.990 --> 18:22.212
Well, that actually
sounds pretty perfect.

Okay, people, to review--

19:06.956 --> 19:10.620
Every time a military jet
flies over,

19:10.721 --> 19:15.065
I want everything
on this stage to shake.

19:15.165 --> 19:16.986
Morning, Jer. Miss me?

19:17.087 --> 19:19.289
Shh! I'm listening
to the tech rehearsal.

19:21.171 --> 19:22.953
I'll take that as a yes.
What is this...

19:23.052 --> 19:24.514
Bill! Bill!

19:24.615 --> 19:27.157
...the big magilla
they've been working on
all week?

19:27.257 --> 19:30.080
That's Kathleen Townsend
and Michael Graves

19:30.180 --> 19:32.042
doing "Ghosts
of Pensacola" here.

19:32.142 --> 19:33.563
I'm losing my shit.

19:33.664 --> 19:35.044
Hey, hey. No, that's not food.

19:35.145 --> 19:37.247
It's a prop. Prop food.

19:37.347 --> 19:38.969
Respect it.
Well, this is, this is food.

19:39.069 --> 19:40.451
This is food. You're nuts.

19:40.551 --> 19:42.733
Listen up.
No peanuts in anything.

19:42.832 --> 19:45.335
The third banana onstage
has an allergy.

19:45.435 --> 19:47.498
It's our one-night-only
gala event.

19:47.598 --> 19:51.462
It's a sellout, and I don't
get halibut every day.

19:51.562 --> 19:54.024
So I need everyone
on their toes. Okay.

20:09.740 --> 20:12.603
Wait. Charlie. No!

20:23.433 --> 20:25.435
Oh, goddamn you!

20:26.436 --> 20:28.599
What the hell?!

20:30.200 --> 20:31.421
Hey, Kathleen.

20:31.521 --> 20:32.822
Why don't you grab me some extra

20:32.923 --> 20:35.145
thousand island dressing
while you're back there?

20:35.245 --> 20:36.426
What?

20:36.526 --> 20:37.947
Son of a bitch!

20:38.048 --> 20:39.269
Mats work!

20:39.369 --> 20:40.751
Bring me the Philistine.

20:42.212 --> 20:44.695
Oh, please, God, no,
don't break another wig.

20:50.139 --> 20:53.524
Hey.
Now you listen to me.

20:53.624 --> 20:55.966
When an actor is performing,

20:56.066 --> 21:00.050
you don't sneeze,
you don't breathe.

21:00.149 --> 21:02.893
You don't dump fucking ice

21:02.993 --> 21:05.576
in a fucking frozé dispenser.

21:05.676 --> 21:08.859
Okay, listen, lady,
I, I, I, I really. I just...

21:08.959 --> 21:10.260
I'm just doing my job here.

21:10.360 --> 21:12.422
What, do you think people
come here for the food?

21:12.522 --> 21:14.224
Well, yeah. I mean, kind of.

21:14.323 --> 21:16.827
Uh... You know,
I'm just a waitress.

21:16.927 --> 21:18.268
It's not really my fault
that this place came

21:18.368 --> 21:19.990
with a talking wall.

21:20.090 --> 21:22.993
That stage is an altar

21:23.092 --> 21:25.355
where we bare our souls

21:25.455 --> 21:28.038
in search of the truth.

21:28.138 --> 21:31.281
Now you will respect that,
young lady,

21:31.380 --> 21:33.463
or you can hit
the fucking bricks.

21:35.264 --> 21:36.807
The truth.

21:36.907 --> 21:38.928
Wow. Uh, yeah, sorry.

21:39.029 --> 21:41.291
I just, I happen to know
a thing or two about the truth,

21:41.390 --> 21:42.452
so I'll tell you.

21:42.552 --> 21:44.615
You got Patrick Swayze,
"Roadhouse."

21:44.715 --> 21:46.577
Jennifer Jason Leigh,
"Single White Female."

21:46.677 --> 21:49.059
Christian Slater,
"True Romance."

21:49.158 --> 21:50.781
Truth, truth, truth. Now, you.

21:50.880 --> 21:52.743
Uh, well, I did happen to catch

21:52.842 --> 21:54.784
a few words
through the rainstorm.

21:54.885 --> 21:57.828
And I'll tell you the truth,
I didn't believe a single word.

21:57.927 --> 22:01.311
In fact, I would say that
that's maybe the biggest batch

22:01.411 --> 22:03.072
of bullshit I've heard
in my whole,

22:03.173 --> 22:05.175
yeah, whole entire life.

22:05.816 --> 22:08.038
Jesus.

22:08.138 --> 22:10.721
I get it. I'll see myself out.

22:10.821 --> 22:13.904
I haven't been spoken to
that way in 30 years.

22:15.985 --> 22:17.687
Uh-huh.

22:17.788 --> 22:20.129
Does this mean I'm not fired?
Fired?

22:20.230 --> 22:22.853
My God. What you're
giving me is gold.

22:22.953 --> 22:24.955
It's fuel.

22:26.076 --> 22:28.839
I live off it. I use it.

22:30.560 --> 22:32.502
And you're lucky
you took those earbuds out

22:32.601 --> 22:36.126
because you're about to hear
the performance of a lifetime.

22:39.730 --> 22:41.632
I love your work.

22:41.732 --> 22:43.754
Hey.

22:43.854 --> 22:44.794
Hey.

22:44.895 --> 22:46.597
You survived a face full

22:46.697 --> 22:48.278
of Kathleen Townsend, kid.

22:48.378 --> 22:52.162
Uh, I mean, you seem like
a normal guy, Phil.

22:52.262 --> 22:54.124
How are you putting up
with these theatre people?

22:54.224 --> 22:58.048
Well, you got to love 'em,
and you got to understand 'em.

22:58.148 --> 23:01.011
I mean, what Kathleen said,
she's right.

23:01.110 --> 23:04.174
What happens on that stage
is a kind of magic.

23:04.274 --> 23:06.255
And I get to see
someone hit with it,

23:06.356 --> 23:09.740
truly transformed by it
for the first time every show.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.982
That's probably
why I keep doing it.

23:12.081 --> 23:14.464
Well, you're a better man
than me, Phil.

23:14.563 --> 23:18.187
Well, everything I said
and, but also,

23:18.288 --> 23:19.428
Jack Daniels

23:19.529 --> 23:22.913
is my dramaturg.

23:23.013 --> 23:26.996
Now you see, this is the kind
of pep talk I can get behind.

23:27.097 --> 23:29.239
One night only, kid.

23:29.339 --> 23:31.341
After opening, this is all over.

23:32.903 --> 23:35.524
To opening night.

23:43.153 --> 23:44.494
Excuse me, darling.

23:44.594 --> 23:46.495
Can you get me
absolutely shit-faced?

23:46.596 --> 23:48.859
Oh, you'll never see
the bottom of that glass.

23:48.959 --> 23:50.961
You mean like you?

23:52.842 --> 23:56.466
Summer felt like winter

23:56.566 --> 23:57.668
felt like spring.

23:57.768 --> 23:59.389
Makes you miss
the hip-hop Ben Franklin.

23:59.489 --> 24:01.390
I didn't know what
the seasons felt like--

24:01.491 --> 24:04.033
<i>...you washed-up has-been.</i>

24:04.134 --> 24:06.276
<i>You pathetic, preening prick!</i>

24:06.376 --> 24:07.677
Glad someone's riveted.

24:07.778 --> 24:09.559
<i>...actress. You're a joke.</i>

24:09.658 --> 24:11.001
Kathleen and Michael
are fighting backstage,

24:11.100 --> 24:12.282
and they forgot
to turn off their mics.

24:12.382 --> 24:13.643
<i>...failure.</i>

24:13.743 --> 24:15.725
<i>The whole crew
used to laugh at you.</i>

24:15.826 --> 24:18.288
You weren't kidding.
<i>Actress?
More like hacktress.</i>

24:18.388 --> 24:21.091
Hold on, if we can hear this,

24:21.191 --> 24:23.193
you realise who else
can hear it, right?

24:24.835 --> 24:28.658
And I always ask myself,
why, God, why?

24:28.758 --> 24:31.702
But Bobby always
made me feel...
<i>Prune!</i>

24:31.802 --> 24:34.825
<i>Not as shriveled
as your tiny little dick!</i>

24:34.925 --> 24:36.586
<i>Asshole!</i>

24:36.686 --> 24:38.709
<i>You vain,
backstabbing hack.</i>

24:38.809 --> 24:41.511
Who's talking?
Is that the ghost?

24:41.610 --> 24:43.613
That's all I've ever wanted.

24:48.938 --> 24:53.363
Oh. Feels like
a storm is brewin'.

24:53.463 --> 24:57.367
I saw the Crawford boy down
the supermarket today.

24:57.466 --> 24:58.648
He asked about you.

24:58.748 --> 25:00.409
Thanks.
Oh, stop it,
Mama!

25:00.510 --> 25:03.373
Stop thinking that
any man would ever want me.

25:03.473 --> 25:05.735
Kill me.
Oh!

25:05.836 --> 25:08.378
There are two kinds
of men in Pensacola--

25:08.478 --> 25:12.302
pilots, and the men
who keep 'em up in the air.

25:12.402 --> 25:14.504
And if you forget,
they'll remind you.

25:14.604 --> 25:15.585
Watch Kathleen.

25:15.685 --> 25:16.746
Some folks say that's why--

25:16.847 --> 25:18.948
She's so present.

25:19.049 --> 25:20.590
Look at her.

25:20.690 --> 25:23.273
Fear and anticipation
in her eyes.

25:24.895 --> 25:26.316
Yeah, you're right.

25:26.416 --> 25:28.118
This is the first time
I've really believed her.

25:30.300 --> 25:32.322
Look out!

25:32.422 --> 25:34.164
(grunting) Ava!

25:34.264 --> 25:35.524
Michael!
Oh!

25:35.625 --> 25:38.908
Ava!

25:45.274 --> 25:48.138
Ava! Ava!

25:48.238 --> 25:50.440
Audience Member: Oh, my God!

25:55.165 --> 25:57.828
I mean, look,
it's not your fault.

25:57.927 --> 26:00.669
A woman fell to her death
on my stage.

26:00.770 --> 26:01.831
How is it not my fault?

26:01.932 --> 26:04.313
Because it was
a crazy accident, okay?

26:04.414 --> 26:06.276
I mean, just think
about all the things

26:06.376 --> 26:08.158
that had to go wrong.

26:08.258 --> 26:10.760
The light fell.
Michael had a heart attack.

26:10.860 --> 26:12.883
His wife ran up with his pills

26:12.983 --> 26:16.446
after I poured her a bottle
of the good stuff, by the way.

26:16.546 --> 26:19.209
If any one of those things
hadn't happened,

26:19.309 --> 26:20.971
you and me will be
outside by the dumpsters

26:21.071 --> 26:23.653
ranking Christopher Nolan
movies right now.

26:23.753 --> 26:25.774
No, as soon as
the curtain goes up,

26:25.875 --> 26:27.877
it's all my responsibility.

26:28.959 --> 26:30.981
I guess I'm lucky.

26:31.081 --> 26:32.662
All the cops had to do
is check my thermos,

26:32.762 --> 26:34.764
and I'd be sitting in a cell.

26:36.366 --> 26:38.788
Come on. I know you.

26:38.888 --> 26:40.870
It was just
a little Irish coffee

26:40.971 --> 26:42.192
to take the edge off, right?

26:42.292 --> 26:44.293
Yeah, that's what I thought.

26:44.694 --> 26:46.356
Maybe I'm a lightweight now.

26:46.456 --> 26:49.960
I know I checked that bolt
and those pads.

26:50.060 --> 26:52.382
It's the last thing
I remember before...

26:55.264 --> 26:56.847
Oh God.

26:56.947 --> 26:59.089
Oh God.

26:59.188 --> 27:00.290
Oh, my God.

27:00.389 --> 27:02.392
Oh, my God.

27:03.072 --> 27:05.395
Oh, my God.

27:07.957 --> 27:10.460
Jesus. Should you be
leaving those out?

27:10.560 --> 27:12.462
Baby, I'm an actress.

27:12.562 --> 27:15.345
If I didn't have a bottle
of Ambien in my dressing room,

27:15.445 --> 27:17.226
people would ask questions.

27:17.327 --> 27:18.788
Yeah, it's too bad about Phil.

27:18.888 --> 27:21.671
It's not like
he's in jail or anything.

27:21.771 --> 27:24.594
He just went a little overboard.

27:24.694 --> 27:27.597
Wow. You really missed
your window for playing
a femme fatale.

27:27.697 --> 27:30.120
Now, I can remind
the whole world

27:30.220 --> 27:32.762
what Kathleen Townsend can do.

27:32.861 --> 27:36.046
And the world is watching.

27:36.146 --> 27:38.048
What are you talking about?

27:38.148 --> 27:40.931
We are trending, baby.

27:41.031 --> 27:42.132
Right now,

27:42.232 --> 27:45.014
people are watching us.

27:45.115 --> 27:47.437
They are really watching.

27:49.158 --> 27:53.944
And I never got
to deliver my monologue.

27:54.043 --> 27:56.026
No.
Yes.

27:56.126 --> 27:58.989
One last performance. Tonight.

27:59.089 --> 28:00.590
No.
For Ava.

28:00.690 --> 28:01.711
No.
For Ava.

28:01.811 --> 28:02.993
Fuck that.

28:03.092 --> 28:05.835
What happened to
we hide out overseas for a year

28:05.935 --> 28:08.437
and then reemerge
confessing our love.

28:08.538 --> 28:09.960
You wrote the script, baby.

28:10.060 --> 28:11.600
I know. I wrote it.

28:11.701 --> 28:12.882
And now I'm flipping it. No.

28:12.982 --> 28:14.965
I'm flipping
the script entirely.

28:15.065 --> 28:19.970
Yes. Your tragedy
is what drew us together.

28:20.070 --> 28:21.531
It's risky.

28:21.630 --> 28:23.934
Oh, baby...

28:24.033 --> 28:27.697
don't you want
to be together right now?

28:27.797 --> 28:29.819
Yes.
Hmm?

28:29.918 --> 28:32.502
Don't you think
we should start spending

28:32.601 --> 28:34.985
some of that She Trade money?

28:35.085 --> 28:37.087
Oh yes.
Hmm?

28:39.129 --> 28:42.472
The spotlight's ours, baby.

28:42.572 --> 28:44.734
Let's get it while it's hot.

28:56.866 --> 28:58.048
So let me get this straight,

28:58.148 --> 29:01.011
a woman dies right in our faces

29:01.110 --> 29:03.253
and instead of giving us
grief counselling,

29:03.351 --> 29:04.975
we have to work?

29:05.075 --> 29:06.976
Theatre people are so strong.

29:07.077 --> 29:10.060
I don't know, it just, it,
it doesn't make any sense.

29:10.159 --> 29:12.942
I mean, the dude had a coronary,

29:13.042 --> 29:14.744
and then his wife died.

29:14.844 --> 29:17.907
Like, what doctor
signed off on this?

29:18.007 --> 29:19.709
Find a seat for Sheriff Ed.

29:19.809 --> 29:22.552
He's some crazy
"Spooky and the Cop" fan.

29:22.652 --> 29:24.514
It's a sellout.
If he doesn't have a ticket...

29:24.614 --> 29:26.235
Give the lawman what he wants.

29:26.336 --> 29:28.437
He just dealt with
the richest woman in Connecticut

29:28.538 --> 29:30.560
getting killed
by a drunk stagehand.

29:30.659 --> 29:32.202
Oh, come on. Bullshit.

29:32.302 --> 29:33.683
Thin ice.

29:33.783 --> 29:35.985
Get out there and keep your job.

29:45.754 --> 29:46.936
What do you want?

29:47.036 --> 29:48.697
Oh, don't worry about Fosse.

29:48.798 --> 29:50.879
He's very well-behaved today.

29:55.125 --> 29:57.107
So I thought it was weird

29:57.206 --> 29:59.389
that Michael was going over
his dialogue for the show

29:59.489 --> 30:02.192
since he didn't miss
a single line in rehearsal.

30:02.292 --> 30:06.235
So I checked in his coat pocket
and lo and behold,

30:06.336 --> 30:10.159
this is not dialogue from
"Ghosts of Pensacola."

30:10.260 --> 30:12.922
This is the fight
that the two of you had

30:13.022 --> 30:15.245
during my monologue.

30:15.345 --> 30:18.927
The fight that you used
to cover up Ava's murder.

30:19.028 --> 30:22.492
Sweetheart, Michael and I
are workshopping

30:22.591 --> 30:25.855
a new play
by a brilliant new writer,

30:25.955 --> 30:28.098
and we're running lines backstage.

30:28.197 --> 30:30.899
That might fly if I had seen

30:31.000 --> 30:32.782
the two of you
backstage together.

30:32.882 --> 30:34.944
But I didn't. You were gone.

30:35.043 --> 30:37.226
And my monologue
gave you just enough time

30:37.327 --> 30:38.828
to sabotage the light
and the trapdoor.

30:38.927 --> 30:40.629
So you did it.

30:40.730 --> 30:42.831
You watch too much "Dateline."

30:42.932 --> 30:44.594
No, but I
have been watching

30:44.694 --> 30:46.515
a heck of a lot of
"Spooky and the Cop."

30:46.616 --> 30:48.638
And this exact thing happens

30:48.738 --> 30:52.841
in season six, episode 11,
"Exit Stage Death."

30:52.942 --> 30:56.065
You lazy assholes
didn't even bother
to change the dialogue.

30:57.547 --> 31:01.331
So, um... here's my price.

31:01.431 --> 31:04.514
And here is my bank info.

31:08.117 --> 31:10.899
So if that money
is not in my account

31:11.000 --> 31:13.703
by the end of the play tonight,

31:13.802 --> 31:15.805
I'm going to the police.

31:18.248 --> 31:20.669
Oh, and one last thing.

31:20.770 --> 31:22.831
I killed that
fucking monologue, okay?

31:22.932 --> 31:25.495
So don't you ever
upstage me again.

31:26.416 --> 31:28.418
Fucking boomers.

31:31.261 --> 31:34.283
Okay, what are we going to do?

31:34.384 --> 31:37.507
We have to pay.
We have no choice.

31:50.320 --> 31:52.341
Just delivering the prop food.

31:52.442 --> 31:54.062
Oh, I belong here.

31:54.163 --> 31:55.825
Yeah. Okay, sir, prop food.

31:55.925 --> 31:57.267
Jesus.

31:59.088 --> 32:01.090
<i>Ten minutes to curtain.</i>

32:02.972 --> 32:04.553
Phil's pre-show checklist.

32:04.654 --> 32:06.115
Oh shit. I got
to do the checklist.

32:06.215 --> 32:07.597
Wow.

32:07.697 --> 32:09.999
He ticked off
the flappy door checkbox
before the show.

32:10.099 --> 32:11.360
It's here.
So?

32:11.461 --> 32:13.883
If he secured the flappy door,

32:13.983 --> 32:15.885
that means that
someone unsecured it.

32:15.985 --> 32:17.126
That means
it wasn't Phil's fault

32:17.225 --> 32:18.328
and it wasn't an accident.

32:18.427 --> 32:20.770
Is anyone else besides Kathleen

32:20.870 --> 32:22.851
supposed to go through
that flappy door?

32:22.952 --> 32:26.656
Her big trapdoor moment?
Are you kidding me?

32:26.755 --> 32:29.098
That means that Kathleen
was the target.

32:29.197 --> 32:30.419
I gotta text Phil.

32:30.520 --> 32:31.781
Oh, my God.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.503
Hey.
It's Charlie.

32:33.601 --> 32:34.944
It wasn't your fault.

32:35.043 --> 32:38.147
It was sabotage. S-A-B-O-O...

32:38.247 --> 32:39.789
That doesn't seem right.
The show is about to start.

32:39.889 --> 32:41.431
Oh, my God, dude, dude,
we just figured out

32:41.531 --> 32:43.032
that someone is trying
to kill Kathleen.

32:43.132 --> 32:45.235
Now you're going to give them
another whack at the piñata.

32:45.335 --> 32:47.197
But the show is about to start!

32:49.819 --> 32:52.041
Oh, if it isn't
my fiercest critic.

32:52.140 --> 32:55.565
Are you here to give me
some notes before my swan song?

32:55.665 --> 32:57.607
It wasn't Phil's fault.

32:57.706 --> 32:59.709
He was framed.

33:00.350 --> 33:01.971
So I think someone drugged him

33:02.071 --> 33:03.812
and futzed with the floor door.

33:03.913 --> 33:05.695
I mean, I don't know why,

33:05.794 --> 33:07.176
but I think you were the target.

33:07.276 --> 33:08.818
Me?

33:08.918 --> 33:12.382
You're the only one
who was supposed
to stand on it, so...

33:12.482 --> 33:14.704
I walk across it many times

33:14.803 --> 33:16.346
and did not fall through.

33:16.446 --> 33:18.848
My blocking is very vigorous.

33:20.249 --> 33:21.471
Okay, uh--
Look,

33:21.571 --> 33:23.873
things happen
in the theatre all the time.

33:23.973 --> 33:25.794
Entire sets collapse.

33:25.895 --> 33:27.877
Live wires get exposed,

33:27.976 --> 33:30.158
they electrocute actors.

33:30.259 --> 33:32.001
But we persevere.

33:32.100 --> 33:34.404
Hey, I-I'm so sorry.
I don't think you're hearing me.

33:34.504 --> 33:36.245
Someone's trying to kill you.

33:36.346 --> 33:38.467
I'm not going to let you
go back out there.

33:43.393 --> 33:45.395
I'm already on.

33:46.436 --> 33:48.418
Now get out of my room.

33:48.518 --> 33:50.520
Wardrobe.

34:05.935 --> 34:07.796
Tomcat?

34:07.897 --> 34:10.219
No, that's a Phantom.

34:11.541 --> 34:13.323
I don't know why they bother.

34:13.423 --> 34:15.805
They say our boys
will be home by Christmas.

34:15.905 --> 34:17.046
Cue 38.

34:17.146 --> 34:18.728
Listen, is that Phil?

34:18.828 --> 34:20.129
Give me that.

34:20.229 --> 34:21.571
Phil, Phil. <i>Hey.</i>

34:21.671 --> 34:23.613
Listen, I, I, I don't get it.

34:23.713 --> 34:25.575
I mean, the bolt
must have been in place

34:25.675 --> 34:27.737
until Ava walked across it.

34:27.837 --> 34:30.259
Did you see anybody else
down there?
<i>Nobody.</i>

34:30.359 --> 34:31.581
Look, Charlie, I appreciate

34:31.681 --> 34:33.663
what you're trying to do,
but just let it go.

34:33.763 --> 34:34.904
<i>No can do, Phil.</i>

34:35.004 --> 34:36.506
I'm like De Niro
at the end of <i>Heat,</i> man.

34:36.606 --> 34:38.608
So stay tuned.

34:40.369 --> 34:42.111
I need to see the video
of last night's show.

34:42.211 --> 34:45.154
Well, be my guest.
Take the curse off me.

34:45.254 --> 34:46.636
It's like the video
from <i>The Ring,</i>

34:46.736 --> 34:48.358
but with Phil gone,
I'm the stage manager

34:48.458 --> 34:50.159
and I have nothing to go on
except this video

34:50.259 --> 34:52.261
and Phil's notes
from last night.

34:54.744 --> 34:56.526
Hey, hey, hey.

34:56.626 --> 34:58.368
What is that?

34:58.468 --> 34:59.609
Is that smoke?

34:59.709 --> 35:01.711
Looks like dry ice.

35:02.672 --> 35:05.034
Where do you keep
this, uh, dry ice?

35:12.522 --> 35:14.143
Ow! Ow! Ow!

35:14.243 --> 35:15.585
You okay?

35:15.685 --> 35:18.908
Jesus. I-I got
to talk to Kathleen.

35:19.008 --> 35:21.791
Hey, wait. Stop!

35:21.891 --> 35:24.754
See that? It's a sight line.

35:24.854 --> 35:27.557
You can't cross it,
you're in the play.

35:27.657 --> 35:31.601
Bobby was my
unexpected gift.

35:31.701 --> 35:33.703
Shameful as it was,

35:34.383 --> 35:36.846
I loved him so.

35:36.946 --> 35:40.209
He liked the stars
that moved fast,

35:40.309 --> 35:42.051
like his aircraft.

35:42.151 --> 35:43.653
Hey, I figured it out.

35:43.753 --> 35:45.214
The bolt was dry ice.

35:45.314 --> 35:47.056
Excuse me. That means
that someone definitely--

35:47.156 --> 35:49.379
The crickets are certainly
very active.

35:49.479 --> 35:51.381
...off! Off the stage.

35:51.481 --> 35:53.182
Oh, these crickets are wild.

35:53.282 --> 35:54.143
Off the stage.

35:54.243 --> 35:55.705
They need to stop, the crickets.

35:55.805 --> 35:57.627
Get off the stage.
You need to stop now.

35:57.727 --> 35:59.188
You need to get off the stage.

35:59.288 --> 36:00.910
Um, Garrett...
Jesus!

36:01.010 --> 36:04.073
...what are you doing
smoking that filthy thing
in the house?

36:04.173 --> 36:06.876
You'll give Daisy pleurisy
if you don't watch out.

36:06.976 --> 36:08.317
Mother, I smoke.

36:08.417 --> 36:10.039
Does that shock you?

36:10.139 --> 36:13.122
That's right.
I smoke cigarettes.

36:13.222 --> 36:15.324
Your daughter, your little girl.

36:15.424 --> 36:17.206
Thank God.
It suits me.
It calms my spirit...

36:17.306 --> 36:19.248
Hey!
...and it eases my mind.

36:19.348 --> 36:21.571
Uh, yeah, well,
looks like we got us

36:21.671 --> 36:23.773
a real smoker, Savannah.

36:23.873 --> 36:24.934
Good for you, Daisy.

36:25.034 --> 36:26.576
Hey, what are you doing?

36:26.676 --> 36:28.898
I myself enjoy smoking

36:28.998 --> 36:30.379
by the window over here.

36:30.479 --> 36:33.663
Let me go. Let me go!

36:33.763 --> 36:35.805
Smoke is going to be
the death of all of us.

36:37.126 --> 36:38.788
I know what let's do...

36:38.888 --> 36:41.110
let's bake something together.

36:41.210 --> 36:42.592
A key lime pie.

36:42.692 --> 36:44.273
Like when you were
a little girl.

36:44.373 --> 36:46.355
I'm not a little girl
anymore, Mama.

36:46.455 --> 36:47.557
It was Michael!

36:47.657 --> 36:50.119
His fingers are burned
from the dry ice

36:50.219 --> 36:51.921
he used to rig the floor.

36:52.021 --> 36:54.283
There's supposed to be milk
in here somewhere.

36:54.383 --> 36:55.845
Oh, there.

36:55.945 --> 36:58.968
Michael was on stage
the entire time.

36:59.068 --> 37:01.651
No, the chubby foot monologue,
that was three minutes.

37:01.751 --> 37:04.053
He could have--
Our argument.

37:04.153 --> 37:06.255
Everyone heard it. You heard it.

37:06.355 --> 37:08.778
Now, what the fuck
are you even talking about?

37:08.878 --> 37:11.100
You almost caught,
the bus, lady.

37:11.200 --> 37:13.142
That falling light
saved your life.

37:13.242 --> 37:15.985
...if I were a refrigerator,
would you pay attention to me?

37:16.085 --> 37:18.948
Exactly. And do you think
he rigged the light
to kill himself?

37:19.048 --> 37:20.510
The light?

37:20.610 --> 37:23.072
...watching life
like his old man!

37:23.172 --> 37:25.755
Why did I push Bobby? Why?

37:25.855 --> 37:29.398
You only told him to aim high.

37:29.498 --> 37:32.482
Isn't that what we all want
for our children?

37:32.582 --> 37:34.163
Oh.

37:34.263 --> 37:36.606
But when I saw him
in those dress blues.

37:36.706 --> 37:40.850
Oh,
that boy was born to fly.

37:40.950 --> 37:43.252
Was he happy, our son?

37:43.352 --> 37:44.974
Was he happy?

37:45.074 --> 37:47.897
Oh, baby,
you and I both know that

37:47.997 --> 37:49.699
Bobby was never happy

37:49.799 --> 37:53.262
other than when he was up there
flying with the birds...

37:53.362 --> 37:57.006
If that matters.
If anything matters.

37:58.207 --> 38:00.209
I love you.

38:01.170 --> 38:03.272
That matters.

38:03.372 --> 38:05.394
The truth.

38:05.494 --> 38:07.496
I love you, too.

38:20.469 --> 38:22.211
Hey, hey, chubby foot.

38:22.311 --> 38:24.333
Uh, we've got a situation here.

38:24.433 --> 38:26.495
Who are you?
Did you just come down
from the lights?

38:26.595 --> 38:27.817
It doesn't matter. So I thought

38:27.917 --> 38:29.619
that Michael was trying
to kill Kathleen,

38:29.719 --> 38:30.980
but I was wrong.

38:31.080 --> 38:34.063
It was his wife,
and they were in it together.

38:34.163 --> 38:35.905
Michael and Kathleen.

38:36.005 --> 38:38.147
You see,
they don't hate each other.

38:38.247 --> 38:39.629
They love each other.
Why are you telling me this?

38:39.729 --> 38:41.751
I'm about to go on.
Oh, because...

38:41.851 --> 38:43.472
Excuse me. You can prove it.

38:43.572 --> 38:47.516
You see, it was during
your foot club speech thing.

38:47.616 --> 38:49.639
He was futzing
with the flappy door,

38:49.739 --> 38:52.722
and she, she was messing
with the light.

38:52.822 --> 38:54.604
What was it?
Three minutes, right?

38:54.704 --> 38:57.847
Yes. But I saw the two
of them backstage together,

38:57.947 --> 38:59.649
so they couldn't possibly
have done it, okay.

38:59.749 --> 39:02.131
So... will you leave me alone?
I have to go on.

39:02.231 --> 39:03.492
Wait, why are you lying?

39:03.592 --> 39:04.734
Wait, are you in love
with him too?

39:04.834 --> 39:06.896
Will you please leave me alone?

39:06.996 --> 39:08.537
Are you a throuple?

39:08.637 --> 39:10.539
Shit.
Mama.

39:10.639 --> 39:13.663
Do you think Billy Crawford
will come calling?

39:13.763 --> 39:17.046
Oh, I could call his mother
and ask her, couldn't I?

39:22.812 --> 39:25.715
No, never mind, Mama.
Forget I mentioned it.

39:25.815 --> 39:28.277
I will.

39:28.377 --> 39:30.920
Do you think there could be
a sign or somethin'?

39:41.951 --> 39:44.073
Fucking actors, man.

39:46.956 --> 39:50.019
Chubby foot. Very hardcore.

39:52.441 --> 39:54.543
Shhh.

39:54.643 --> 39:55.705
Quiet, quiet, hey!

39:55.805 --> 39:57.466
Who wants a yummy, yummy

39:57.566 --> 39:59.568
little peanut butter treat?

40:01.931 --> 40:03.933
Oh shit.

40:09.298 --> 40:11.300
Shit, shit, shit.

40:12.902 --> 40:15.244
Look, honey,
I made you a little snack.

40:15.344 --> 40:16.325
Oh, Jesus.

40:16.425 --> 40:18.427
Thank you, Mama.
Oh shit.

40:19.268 --> 40:20.609
Hey.

40:20.709 --> 40:22.011
Who eats the prop?

40:22.111 --> 40:24.093
Which actor eats the Chex Mix?
Rebecca.

40:24.193 --> 40:26.896
No, they put
peanut butter in it.
They're gonna kill again.

40:26.996 --> 40:28.097
Shit.

40:28.197 --> 40:29.699
I was so young.

40:29.799 --> 40:31.901
Florida State was looking
for a fullback.

40:32.001 --> 40:33.502
Coach was scouting me.

40:33.602 --> 40:35.705
You think I wanted
to get married at 18?

40:35.805 --> 40:37.807
Do you think I did?

41:09.398 --> 41:10.940
Uh...

41:11.040 --> 41:14.383
I am, I am a ghost of Pensacola.

41:14.483 --> 41:17.867
Uh, and you are not here to eat.

41:17.967 --> 41:21.991
You are here to talk
about your chubby foot

41:22.091 --> 41:24.914
and, uh, feelings.

41:25.014 --> 41:28.677
Do not let your mother

41:28.777 --> 41:30.980
poison your spirit...

41:33.062 --> 41:36.726
and drive you nuts.

41:36.826 --> 41:40.009
And now I will return

41:40.109 --> 41:43.632
to the spirit realm
of Pensacola.

41:44.793 --> 41:46.055
Okay.

41:46.155 --> 41:47.937
Goodbye!

41:50.479 --> 41:51.901
What, why are you looking at me?

41:52.001 --> 41:54.063
What'd I do? What'd I say?
Listen, Rebec--

41:54.163 --> 41:56.265
I mean, Daisy. Listen, Daisy.

41:56.365 --> 41:57.386
I had nothing to do
with your mum--

41:57.486 --> 41:58.908
Mama.
What?

41:59.008 --> 42:02.431
Daddy. You already lost
one child,

42:02.531 --> 42:04.693
and you almost lost another one.

42:05.895 --> 42:08.958
So now, the price of my love

42:09.058 --> 42:10.719
has doubled,

42:10.819 --> 42:13.662
and I demand
to see it immediately.

42:15.504 --> 42:17.506
Are you fucking kidding me?
Immediately!

42:23.432 --> 42:27.977
Summer felt like winter...

42:28.077 --> 42:31.100
How could you do that
without talking to me first?

42:31.200 --> 42:33.943
What? Oh, yes.

42:36.525 --> 42:38.387
What were you thinking?

42:38.487 --> 42:40.830
Someone had to do it.

42:40.930 --> 42:42.992
You're insane.

42:43.092 --> 42:45.394
We could have paid her off.
This would all be over.

42:45.494 --> 42:47.556
Oh, don't be so naive.

42:47.656 --> 42:49.658
She would have just
come back for more.

42:51.901 --> 42:55.224
Hey, Sheriff.
Never meet your heroes, right?

42:57.947 --> 43:00.369
<i>You spend years planning
your wife's murder</i>

43:00.469 --> 43:03.172
<i>to get shafted
by a fucking' day player.</i>

43:03.272 --> 43:05.134
I will shove that peanut butter

43:05.234 --> 43:08.737
down that Juilliard
bitch's throat if I have to.

43:08.837 --> 43:11.420
No. Okay, look, that's it.

43:11.520 --> 43:13.302
We're going to pay
her off, alright?

43:13.402 --> 43:14.783
I'm going to call
my business manager.

43:14.883 --> 43:17.026
He is going to have a fit.

43:17.126 --> 43:20.029
Michael,
what the fuck is that?

43:20.129 --> 43:22.131
What?

43:22.451 --> 43:24.453
What in the hell?

43:27.136 --> 43:29.778
Oh... shit.

43:36.385 --> 43:38.207
We're fucked.

43:38.307 --> 43:40.309
They heard everything.

43:41.991 --> 43:43.993
What do I do now?

43:47.196 --> 43:49.198
We use it.

43:49.878 --> 43:51.880
Showtime, baby.

43:55.564 --> 43:58.827
I used to wait
for that parade every year.

43:58.927 --> 44:00.929
Independence Day.

44:02.051 --> 44:04.994
For who? From what?

44:05.094 --> 44:08.157
Bobby's real daddy went down
over the Sea of Japan.

44:09.298 --> 44:11.820
July 12th, 1952.

44:13.382 --> 44:14.843
An aviator.

44:16.385 --> 44:19.168
Why did you take Bobby?

44:19.268 --> 44:22.011
He was better than me
in every way!

44:23.952 --> 44:27.116
It was cold
in Pensacola that winter.

44:28.157 --> 44:30.379
Unnatural cold.

44:30.479 --> 44:33.062
Frost that comes too early

44:33.162 --> 44:35.464
means to stay too long,

44:35.564 --> 44:37.146
maybe forever.

44:37.246 --> 44:39.788
The mists rise up.

44:39.888 --> 44:44.353
They cover your ankles,
then your waist.

44:44.453 --> 44:48.057
The sea longs
to reach the clouds.

44:50.059 --> 44:53.562
Mother and child
reachin' out for each other.

44:53.662 --> 44:55.984
When my sweet Bobby went up...

44:57.466 --> 45:00.009
he always took me with him.

45:00.109 --> 45:02.471
And so it follows that that day,

45:03.552 --> 45:05.554
I, too, went down.

45:07.076 --> 45:09.078
That cold winter.

45:10.999 --> 45:13.102
This winter.

45:13.202 --> 45:17.066
The mists up to the lashline.

45:17.166 --> 45:20.069
Ice on the wing
is mist on the ground,

45:20.169 --> 45:22.231
is tears.

45:22.331 --> 45:24.033
The mist rises up,

45:24.133 --> 45:26.455
and I kneel down to meet it.

45:29.938 --> 45:33.682
And so now I too become

45:33.782 --> 45:35.784
just another ghost...

45:41.430 --> 45:42.811
of Pensacola.

45:47.035 --> 45:48.097
