01:19.454 --> 01:21.621
- Where's Vince?
- No clue.

01:21.655 --> 01:23.923
He'd better hurry, I've got to
meet my accountant in an hour.

01:23.957 --> 01:25.590
You mean Vince's accountant.

01:25.625 --> 01:27.191
- I pay him.
- Yeah, on layaway.

01:27.226 --> 01:29.326
Good one, E.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.994
It's a sad day when you're
jealous of my success, Drama.

01:32.029 --> 01:34.829
Your definition of success
and mine are way different.

01:34.863 --> 01:37.130
Yeah, I have my own
company, you have nothing.

01:37.164 --> 01:39.298
- He's got me.
- Damn straight, player.

01:39.332 --> 01:41.299
I don't like you two as a team.

01:41.333 --> 01:44.300
Get used to it 'cause
this team is going places.

01:45.335 --> 01:47.402
Yo yo.

01:47.436 --> 01:49.536
Great mother of God.

01:49.571 --> 01:51.437
You bought a motorcycle.

01:51.472 --> 01:54.640
Don't worry, E. Made sure
to get one with airbags.

01:54.675 --> 01:56.508
- Hilarious.
- So what's up? Are we eating?

01:56.542 --> 01:58.509
We're done. We waited
an hour. I've got Marvin.

01:58.544 --> 02:00.844
I'm sorry. I didn't know how long
it was going to take at the dealer.

02:00.878 --> 02:02.945
Anyway, what are you guys gonna do?

02:02.979 --> 02:05.980
- Office.
- We have a meeting
with an emmy-winning writer.

02:06.014 --> 02:08.747
Oh well, hop on, E. I'll give you a ride.

02:08.782 --> 02:10.949
I want to show your boy
Lavin my bike anyway.

02:10.984 --> 02:12.918
- He's not my boy.
- Whatever. Hop on.

02:12.952 --> 02:15.986
No, I'm not sitting on that weird
little seat wrapping my arms around you.

02:16.020 --> 02:18.320
- All right. Johnny, you want to race?
- No.

02:18.354 --> 02:20.188
Come on, remember when we were kids?

02:20.223 --> 02:23.557
- We used to race to the
market and play street fighter.
- We were on schwinns, bro.

02:23.591 --> 02:26.726
Think about how much more fun
this will be. Don't be a pussy.

02:26.760 --> 02:28.426
I'll see you there.

02:28.461 --> 02:30.027
- Come on, E.
- We're not racing.

02:30.062 --> 02:31.461
- Come on!
- Yes we are!

02:31.496 --> 02:32.695
Be careful. Drive slow.

02:32.730 --> 02:35.597
Can't be careful. We're racing.

02:42.737 --> 02:45.504
Why are you taking me
to school today, daddy?

02:45.539 --> 02:49.040
Because I want to take some of the load
off mommy. You know how hard she works.

02:49.075 --> 02:50.941
- Must have done something wrong.
- No.

02:50.976 --> 02:53.609
- What did you do, daddy?
- I didn't do anything.

02:53.643 --> 02:55.209
Hey, baby.

02:55.244 --> 02:57.710
- Told you. You did something.
- She's right.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.912
Honey, tell them that we're all good.

02:59.946 --> 03:02.613
- What do you guys want for breakfast?
- French toast.

03:02.647 --> 03:06.215
Okay, so who's come up with
a name for our football team?

03:06.249 --> 03:08.583
I think everyone's a little
sick of talking about this, Ari.

03:08.618 --> 03:10.818
This family is going to own
an N.F.L. team, all right?

03:10.853 --> 03:12.653
We're gonna talk about it 24 hours a day.

03:12.687 --> 03:15.455
You kept your son up all
night long talking about this.

03:15.490 --> 03:18.090
- Look at him. He's falling asleep.
- Just kidding.

03:18.125 --> 03:19.725
Do you know what?

03:19.759 --> 03:22.027
I will have breakfast ready as
soon as you get ready for school.

03:22.061 --> 03:23.929
Your father's taking you
for the first time this year

03:23.963 --> 03:25.697
and I'd like you to be on time.

03:25.731 --> 03:27.365
You want me to get him, mom?

03:27.399 --> 03:29.634
No no no, jews don't carry
guns, buddy. You know that.

03:29.668 --> 03:33.737
- The Jewish army does.
- Excuse me! Could you please
get ready for school?

03:35.239 --> 03:37.774
- Can you give us one second, honey?
- Okay.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.844
What are you so upset about?

03:41.879 --> 03:43.545
- What am I so upset about?
- Yeah.

03:43.580 --> 03:45.647
The slut that ruined
your best friend's career

03:45.681 --> 03:47.681
and marriage is still
working in your office.

03:47.716 --> 03:49.582
And if that wasn't enough, for some reason

03:49.617 --> 03:52.518
you were spinning her around like
you'd just won "Dancing with the stars."

03:52.552 --> 03:54.753
- No, I... 
- Why were you spinning her around?

03:54.788 --> 03:57.889
Because I had just got the call
from the N.F.L. and I was excited.

03:57.924 --> 04:00.292
I have dreamt since I was a kid

04:00.326 --> 04:01.993
about owning a football team.

04:02.028 --> 04:04.162
I would have spun Lloyd around

04:04.196 --> 04:06.430
if he was in front of me.
And if I could lift him.

04:06.464 --> 04:09.333
I don't like that girl, Ari.
I don't like her one bit.

04:09.367 --> 04:11.935
And I still don't understand why
you didn't fire her last year.

04:11.969 --> 04:14.270
If I was gonna fire anyone,
it should have been Andrew.

04:14.304 --> 04:17.039
You know what? Maybe you
should have fired them both.

04:23.111 --> 04:25.546
Oh!

04:25.580 --> 04:27.114
- This is badass.
- You like?

04:27.148 --> 04:29.082
- Yes.
- I fucking love it.

04:29.116 --> 04:31.449
E must be losing his mind.

04:31.484 --> 04:34.119
I told him the good news is you
get into an accident on a bike,

04:34.153 --> 04:37.621
- you don't break legs. Usually you just die.
- Hey, I've got a '60 Panhead.

04:37.655 --> 04:40.691
- We should go for a putt
this weekend, the rock store.
- That'd be great.

04:40.725 --> 04:43.126
- Hey, want to take it for a spin right now?
- I would love to.

04:43.160 --> 04:45.694
I've got to go to this auction
and buy some wine for a client.

04:45.729 --> 04:47.996
- You do that for your clients?
- I'd like to have you believe that,

04:48.031 --> 04:51.900
but Murray is playing golf
with Sean Connery in Scotland.

04:51.934 --> 04:53.969
So it falls on me to
do all his bitch work.

04:54.003 --> 04:56.471
You should hear some of the
things I made E do over the years.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.673
I'd very much enjoy that. Truth be told,

04:58.707 --> 05:01.241
I'd suck herpes out of
a girl's ass for you.

05:01.276 --> 05:03.376
- I got beef with Murray.
- Never met him.

05:03.411 --> 05:05.178
No, why would you? He's never here.

05:05.212 --> 05:08.580
- Hence the empty parking spot.
- They got other things at this auction?

05:08.614 --> 05:10.749
They got art, coins, all kinds of shit.

05:10.783 --> 05:13.017
- Perfect, I'll roll with.
- All right.

05:13.052 --> 05:14.619
Pick up some things for the house.

05:14.653 --> 05:17.287
Or maybe I'll just raise the
bidding on Connery's wine.

05:17.321 --> 05:19.256
I like it. Force him out of retirement.

05:19.290 --> 05:20.857
Actually pull in some commissions.

05:20.892 --> 05:23.193
Pull around, I'll see you in a second.

05:27.731 --> 05:30.532
So, I won my first two Emmys

05:30.567 --> 05:33.835
for "The days and nights of Molly Dodd" in '87
-'88.

05:33.869 --> 05:36.337
I won my third for "The
famous Teddy Z" in '89

05:36.372 --> 05:40.674
and then in '91 was my fourth and
final one for "Designing women."

05:40.709 --> 05:41.875
All before the age of 30.

05:41.910 --> 05:43.844
No wins after '91?

05:43.878 --> 05:47.046
To tell you the truth, I haven't
had a produced script since '91.

05:47.081 --> 05:50.616
Roger made so much money
in the '80s that in 1991,

05:50.650 --> 05:53.417
much to his first Agent
Ari Gold's chagrin,

05:53.452 --> 05:56.286
- he decided to retire young.
- And now you're unretiring?

05:56.321 --> 05:59.055
Roger lost a lot of money in the
market the last couple of years.

05:59.089 --> 06:01.824
And my stay-at-home
husband took a lot more.

06:01.859 --> 06:04.593
So you're just getting back
into the business for money?

06:04.628 --> 06:06.795
I was hoping whoever was
going to write my show

06:06.829 --> 06:09.497
- was going to be excited to work for me.
- Work for you?

06:09.531 --> 06:12.066
Johnny, Roger is very excited.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.101
Not to work for you, but to work with you.

06:14.135 --> 06:16.437
- Right, Roger?
- I'm exuberant.

06:16.471 --> 06:17.971
So what's this show about?

06:18.006 --> 06:20.740
It's about two brothers who
work at the four seasons Maui.

06:20.775 --> 06:22.675
- You ever been there?
- No.

06:22.710 --> 06:24.143
It's incredible.

06:24.178 --> 06:26.579
So this show is just an
excuse to live in Maui?

06:26.613 --> 06:28.546
And what would be so wrong with that?

06:28.581 --> 06:30.248
Yeah, don't worry about that, Drama.

06:30.282 --> 06:33.384
- Yeah, Johnny. You're gonna love Maui.
- I do love Maui.

06:33.419 --> 06:36.253
I'm just concerned about
what the show is going to be.

06:36.287 --> 06:38.021
I'm just concerned
you've only done sitcoms.

06:38.056 --> 06:40.189
Mostly multi-camera work.
Have you ever done any dramas?

06:40.224 --> 06:43.558
- I don't do dramas.
- And I don't do comedy. I'm not funny.

06:43.593 --> 06:47.295
Lloyd sent me tape of you and
you're incredibly funny, Johnny,

06:47.329 --> 06:48.696
even though you don't mean to be.

06:48.730 --> 06:50.898
As a matter of fact,
after I watched your stuff

06:50.932 --> 06:53.568
I wrote 10 pages. And it's good.

06:53.603 --> 06:57.538
Here, read it. If you like
it I'll write some more.

06:57.573 --> 07:00.508
Until then, I got a mani-pedi to roll to.

07:00.542 --> 07:02.176
- Ciao, Lloyd.
- Bye, sweetie.

07:02.210 --> 07:03.744
- Take care, Roger.
- Yeah.

07:03.778 --> 07:07.514
- Well? - What's with
the arrogant has-been?

07:07.548 --> 07:10.216
I thought we were gonna get some
high-end showrunners in here.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.517
- I'm setting all I can.
- What about Dick Wolf?

07:12.552 --> 07:16.287
He personally told me I was great
when I played a streaker in "S.V.U."

07:16.321 --> 07:19.223
Drama, we've been calling
everywhere. We're gonna keep looking.

07:19.258 --> 07:21.458
In the meantime, let's
just read Roger's script.

07:21.493 --> 07:23.727
It was written just for you.

07:23.761 --> 07:26.529
Hopefully I'm not based on
his stay-at-home husband.

07:26.563 --> 07:28.831
What would be so wrong with
playing a stay-at-home husband?

07:28.865 --> 07:30.799
Nothing, Lloyd. Nothing.

07:30.834 --> 07:33.068
Take it easy.

07:33.102 --> 07:35.870
- You don't seem happy, Marvin.
- Your business stinks.

07:35.904 --> 07:38.338
And you don't pay me.
Why would I be happy?

07:38.372 --> 07:41.307
- My business is growing.
- You lost two grand last month.

07:41.341 --> 07:43.509
Yeah, but I lost three
grand the month before.

07:43.543 --> 07:45.277
That's because you stopped eating lunch.

07:45.311 --> 07:48.546
- There's got to be something I can do.
- Take out an insurance policy,

07:48.581 --> 07:52.450
fake your death. We'll mail you
some cash to Guatemala or someplace.

07:52.484 --> 07:55.386
Can you at least try and
take this seriously, please?

07:55.420 --> 07:58.755
Hey, I'm dead serious. You are
running out of cash and fast.

07:58.790 --> 08:01.124
I sank every dollar I
had into this, Marvin.

08:01.158 --> 08:04.761
Yeah, I know that. And Vince
sunk in about 30 grand also.

08:04.795 --> 08:07.863
Sunk being the operative word.

08:07.898 --> 08:10.299
Nobody thought I could pull
this off when I started.

08:10.334 --> 08:12.768
And look, I put together a real business.

08:12.803 --> 08:16.071
Turtle, it's admirable what you've
attempted. I really mean that.

08:16.105 --> 08:19.240
And to tell you the truth, you're
costing Vince a lot less money now

08:19.274 --> 08:21.275
when you're working than when you weren't.

08:21.309 --> 08:23.343
But you're gonna run out of cash soon

08:23.378 --> 08:27.147
and you cannot get any more money
from Vince. That bank is closed.

08:27.181 --> 08:30.216
You'd better figure out
something else and quick.

08:32.852 --> 08:35.352
- Ari, Ari, Ari.
- Barbara, Barbara, Barbara.

08:35.388 --> 08:37.022
Did you have a stroke and now stutter?

08:37.056 --> 08:39.090
Is there something going
on that I should know about?

08:39.124 --> 08:41.792
- Something going on?
- With the N.F.L.?

08:43.128 --> 08:44.928
- Who told you?
- People are talking.

08:44.962 --> 08:47.130
- What people?
- What difference does it make?

08:47.164 --> 08:48.831
- Is it true?
- Yes, it's true.

08:48.865 --> 08:50.632
I was going to talk to you about it today.

08:50.667 --> 08:52.534
What does it mean? Are you leaving here?

08:52.568 --> 08:55.636
- Of course not.
- That's not what people think.

08:55.671 --> 08:57.071
What people?

08:57.105 --> 08:58.739
The people who are talking.

08:58.773 --> 09:00.974
Let's straighten it out. Let's
get the people to stop talking.

09:01.008 --> 09:04.677
Everyone, conference room quickly!

09:04.711 --> 09:07.146
And quickly means run!

09:07.180 --> 09:09.581
Ari, can we go to lunch today?

09:09.615 --> 09:11.249
- What? No, why?
- I need to talk.

09:11.283 --> 09:14.285
Email me. Okay, people, here's the thing.

09:14.320 --> 09:18.122
This merger has made me more
famous than I ever wanted to be.

09:18.157 --> 09:20.824
I don't want to be known, I
don't want to be talked about.

09:20.859 --> 09:22.392
I have ears everywhere.

09:22.427 --> 09:24.494
Let me just say that if those ears

09:24.528 --> 09:28.431
hear about anyone talking
about me, that person will die.

09:28.465 --> 09:31.266
And I'm not threatening your
jobs, I'm threatening your lives.

09:31.301 --> 09:33.502
And I'm serious. But
here's what's happening,

09:33.536 --> 09:35.070
in case any of you have heard.

09:35.104 --> 09:39.007
I'm bringing an N.F.L.
team to Los Angeles.

09:42.277 --> 09:44.644
And it won't affect
this company, by the way,

09:44.679 --> 09:47.213
except we all might have
really good football seats.

09:47.248 --> 09:49.882
Mike Ovitz couldn't do it. I will.

09:53.153 --> 09:54.552
Shh.

09:54.587 --> 09:57.355
The N.F.L. has a prestigious reputation.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.857
What you say and do can affect mine.

09:59.891 --> 10:02.793
Don't. Shh.

10:07.665 --> 10:10.200
- Ari.
- Didn't I tell you to email me?

10:10.234 --> 10:12.168
- Are you mad at me about something?
- No.

10:12.202 --> 10:14.603
It was you who was twirling me
around in front of your wife.

10:14.638 --> 10:16.605
I'm not mad at you. I'm
just busy. What's up?

10:16.639 --> 10:19.207
Okay. I want to ask you a question.

10:19.241 --> 10:21.609
And I want you to think
about it before you answer.

10:21.643 --> 10:23.744
- Speak.
- Andrew has left us.

10:23.778 --> 10:26.947
- He's obviously not coming back.
- He is in rehab.

10:26.981 --> 10:31.184
- And when he's done
rehabbing he's coming back.
- Okay, in the meantime... 

10:31.218 --> 10:33.952
I'm gonna be looking for someone
else to run the TV department.

10:33.987 --> 10:36.288
- I don't think you need to.
- No.

10:36.322 --> 10:38.089
- I didn't even ask you yet.
- No.

10:38.124 --> 10:39.824
And you didn't take
time to think about it.

10:39.858 --> 10:42.226
I just took time to think about
it and the answer is still no.

10:42.260 --> 10:45.261
Okay, Ari, name one person
who is more qualified than me.

10:45.296 --> 10:47.430
I don't know the names

10:47.464 --> 10:49.365
of any people in the TV department.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.733
And the only reason I know
your name is the reason

10:51.768 --> 10:53.935
no one is heading our
television department.

10:53.969 --> 10:56.437
- It's no way to move up.
- Completely unfair.

10:56.471 --> 10:59.106
Tell that to Andrew's fatherless children.

11:00.575 --> 11:03.243
Ari, I have delivered
for you and this company.

11:03.277 --> 11:05.844
I have kept Aaron Sorkin
happy since Andrew left.

11:05.879 --> 11:07.947
I have signed three top showrunners.

11:07.981 --> 11:09.482
I have packaged four TV shows

11:09.516 --> 11:11.317
and I've been dealing
with all the tv talent

11:11.351 --> 11:13.119
that everybody else had been ignoring.

11:13.153 --> 11:15.454
My work speaks for itself

11:15.488 --> 11:17.856
and I would like you to
reasonably consider that.

11:17.890 --> 11:20.292
Well, since you put it like that, um, no.

11:20.326 --> 11:22.661
Ari, I'm not satisfied.

11:22.695 --> 11:25.964
I'm sorry, kid, but I'm not
the man who's gonna satisfy you.

11:33.172 --> 11:34.973
Tell Murray to fuck off.

11:35.007 --> 11:37.876
He says if you don't get the wine,
don't bother coming back to work.

11:37.910 --> 11:39.611
Is that a joke? Are you kidding me?

11:39.645 --> 11:42.447
- I'm afraid not.
- Did you tell him I'm here now?

11:42.482 --> 11:45.384
Of course, but he still wanted
me to pass along the message.

11:45.418 --> 11:48.019
Do you really want me
to pass back "fuck off"?

11:48.053 --> 11:50.221
No. I'll tell him myself
when I speak to him.

11:50.255 --> 11:52.656
- See you later.
- See you soon, Vince.

11:52.691 --> 11:54.157
- All good?
- Yeah.

11:54.192 --> 11:56.326
- You sure?
- My boss is a fucking prick.

11:56.360 --> 11:59.962
- E says he's a nice guy.
- E's marrying his goddaughter. What else is he gonna say?

11:59.997 --> 12:01.630
I hear you.

12:01.665 --> 12:04.599
- How cool is this?
- It's very cool.

12:04.633 --> 12:09.069
That is the skull of a recently
discovered species of allosaurus.

12:09.104 --> 12:10.771
It's Adrian Peterson's.

12:10.805 --> 12:12.506
- Hey, Adrian.
- Vinnie Chase.

12:12.540 --> 12:14.574
- I haven't seen you since New Orleans.
- Yeah.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.743
- Hey, tough loss.
- They're all tough.

12:16.777 --> 12:18.344
You guys trying to buy my skull?

12:18.378 --> 12:20.446
We were just browsing.
Why are you selling it?

12:20.480 --> 12:23.081
Yeah, was Visan the Shiancoe
trying to use it as a cup?

12:23.115 --> 12:25.483
Funny. Just an investment.

12:25.518 --> 12:26.951
A very good one at that.

12:26.986 --> 12:29.553
This is one of the most
rare skulls in the world.

12:29.588 --> 12:32.389
- Really?
- Even more rare than the one Nicolas Cage has.

12:32.424 --> 12:34.458
Nicolas Cage has a dinosaur head?

12:34.492 --> 12:36.860
I'm sure at this point the
I.R.S. has a dinosaur head.

12:36.895 --> 12:40.297
Quite possibly. But he did
outbid Leo for one in 2007.

12:40.332 --> 12:41.932
What did he pay?

12:41.966 --> 12:45.102
- $275,000 I think.
- And you think this would go for more?

12:45.136 --> 12:46.704
- It should.
- It better.

12:46.738 --> 12:48.672
- Good seeing you, Vince.
- Hey, see ya.

12:48.707 --> 12:53.376
You really think this would
go for more than $275,000?

12:53.411 --> 12:55.178
Anything is possible at an auction.

12:55.212 --> 12:58.879
But maybe somebody'll get lucky.

12:58.913 --> 13:01.079
She wants to fuck.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.214
You think I have to buy
the skull in order to?

13:03.248 --> 13:06.384
It couldn't hurt. Oh, wait a minute.

13:06.419 --> 13:09.587
Wait a minute. This is perfect.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.656
- Do you know Randall Wallace?
- Not personally, but I loved "Braveheart".

13:12.691 --> 13:15.092
- You have to meet him.
- You have to introduce me.

13:15.126 --> 13:17.728
After you, please. Hey, Randall.

13:17.763 --> 13:21.265
- Hey, Scott Lavin.
- Oh, Scott.

13:21.299 --> 13:23.167
- Yeah, how are you?
- Good to see you.

13:23.201 --> 13:25.670
- Good to see you. How's Murray?
- Murray is, uh, dead.

13:25.671 --> 13:27.738
I'm kidding. I'm totally kidding.

13:27.773 --> 13:29.373
Listen, you know Vinnie Chase?

13:29.407 --> 13:32.076
Not personally, but I've wanted
to meet you for a long time.

13:32.110 --> 13:34.745
- I'm a huge fan.
- He was just saying what a fan of yours he was.

13:34.779 --> 13:37.080
Just now. I can't wait
to see "Secretariat".

13:37.115 --> 13:39.683
It's testing through the roof.
I can't wait for you to see it.

13:39.717 --> 13:42.986
I tried to sign Randall at the "Pearl
Harbor" premiere. You remember that?

13:43.021 --> 13:45.755
Yeah, you were still in the mail
room at the time as I recall.

13:45.790 --> 13:47.424
You have a very good memory. It's true.

13:47.458 --> 13:49.693
Why haven't you guys found
something to do together?

13:49.727 --> 13:52.996
- You've got to find something.
- Vince, I've got the perfect thing for you

13:53.030 --> 13:56.032
A Stan Lee superhero.
It's called "Air-walker."

13:56.067 --> 13:58.101
- Interesting.
- I know you did "Aquaman".

13:58.135 --> 13:59.736
But this has a whole different feel.

13:59.770 --> 14:01.704
- David Benioff wrote the script.
- Really?

14:01.739 --> 14:04.207
Yeah, and I've been calling
Ari and I don't get a call back.

14:04.241 --> 14:06.009
Talk to Scott. He's right here.

14:06.043 --> 14:08.211
Immediately call me this
week. We'll get into it.

14:08.245 --> 14:09.512
I'll do it. I'll call.

14:09.546 --> 14:11.280
- Good to see you.
- You too, Scott.

14:11.314 --> 14:13.382
- See you later.
- Nice to meet you, Vince.

14:15.185 --> 14:17.853
I think it's hysterical. I know
it's only 10 pages but it's funny.

14:17.887 --> 14:20.155
Well, I don't get it or
know how to make it funny.

14:20.189 --> 14:22.023
You don't have to make it funny. It is.

14:22.057 --> 14:24.893
- But I'm not funny, bro.
- Yes you are, Drama.

14:24.927 --> 14:26.761
That guy Roger was right.
Just play it straight.

14:26.795 --> 14:28.196
Come on, read with me.

14:28.230 --> 14:30.665
I don't think you opposite
me bringing up my best.

14:30.699 --> 14:32.233
Will you just read?

14:34.203 --> 14:36.938
"Why do you think that girl
was looking at you and not me?"

14:36.972 --> 14:39.207
- "Well, look at me."
- "Look at me.

14:39.241 --> 14:41.109
I think there's a whole universe of women

14:41.143 --> 14:43.177
that would look at me as
better looking than you."

14:43.212 --> 14:45.780
"I'll agree, but while
we're living in this universe

14:45.814 --> 14:47.748
let's assume she was looking at me."

14:47.783 --> 14:50.384
What, I'm playing the ugly guy?

14:50.419 --> 14:53.654
No, you're playing the not-as-good-
looking-as-the-really-good-looking guy.

14:53.688 --> 14:57.391
- Yeah, good luck casting that.
- See that, Drama? You are funny.

14:58.827 --> 15:01.228
- You know what? Let's call Yagoda.
- Let's.

15:01.262 --> 15:04.431
In fact, let's just bring
it over to him. Come on.

15:04.466 --> 15:07.067
Do you really need me or can I
go back to other parts of my life?

15:07.102 --> 15:08.703
You love hanging with me. Besides,

15:08.737 --> 15:11.505
now that your boy Lavin stole
Vince, who else you got to hang with?

15:11.540 --> 15:13.440
We'll hang later.

15:13.475 --> 15:15.676
Your loss.

15:15.710 --> 15:18.011
I'm just asking for a favor.

15:18.046 --> 15:19.913
We barely make salary now, Turtle.

15:19.948 --> 15:21.682
But God knows how much you make in tips.

15:21.716 --> 15:23.350
Tips are down with the economy.

15:23.384 --> 15:25.586
And mostly we get cash
offers to give blowjobs.

15:25.620 --> 15:28.255
So is that what you're asking
us to do to make decent money?

15:28.290 --> 15:30.391
Of course I'm not, but I got no choice.

15:30.425 --> 15:32.626
If I want to expand I've
got to make more money.

15:32.661 --> 15:35.262
In order to make more money
I've got to pay you guys less.

15:35.297 --> 15:37.565
- How much less?
- Half.

15:37.599 --> 15:40.034
- What?!
- And I can't pay for your lunches anymore.

15:40.068 --> 15:42.236
- Well, what if we say no?
- You could stay on,

15:42.271 --> 15:44.505
but I'd be looking for replacements
willing to work cheaper.

15:44.539 --> 15:47.407
You're gonna be looking at
some butt-ugly replacements.

15:47.442 --> 15:49.009
Come on, Sarah, please.

15:49.043 --> 15:51.344
- I'm sorry, honey, I can't do it.
- Abby?

15:51.378 --> 15:53.479
I can't either. I'm
barely making rent now.

15:53.513 --> 15:56.649
Seriously, Turtle, we can make
more money being extras on a set.

15:56.683 --> 16:00.719
We were doing this becauseit gave us
more free time to work on other stuff.

16:00.753 --> 16:03.488
- Sorry, Turtle.
- I'm sorry.

16:05.224 --> 16:07.225
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

16:07.259 --> 16:09.460
- Turtle?
- Yeah?

16:09.494 --> 16:12.262
Any way we can get our checks today?

16:12.297 --> 16:15.131
Tomorrow. Just got to transfer
money into that account.

16:15.165 --> 16:17.166
- Oh, God.
- Yeah, I thought so.

16:17.201 --> 16:19.035
- What?
- Bye, Turtle.

16:21.238 --> 16:22.872
Ari.

16:22.906 --> 16:26.175
Didn't we already top our one
conversation per day rule, Babs?

16:26.209 --> 16:27.777
I want to talk about Lizzie.

16:27.811 --> 16:30.079
Oh, Jesus, she went
running to her grandmother.

16:30.113 --> 16:31.847
I think she's a star.

16:31.881 --> 16:34.249
And I think she's a star
who we can get for a lot less

16:34.283 --> 16:37.218
than anybody we bring in from the
outside to run our TV department.

16:37.252 --> 16:38.919
Why don't you run the TV department?

16:38.954 --> 16:40.387
- Why don't you?
- Barbara.

16:40.422 --> 16:43.056
Is this because of what
happened between her and Andrew?

16:43.091 --> 16:45.258
It's because I don't think she's ready.

16:45.292 --> 16:47.694
- Well, I think she is.
- She looks 21.

16:47.728 --> 16:49.396
- Her looks don't matter.
- Really?

16:49.430 --> 16:52.165
We'd still have the head of our TV
department if that were the case.

16:52.200 --> 16:55.269
- So it is about that.
- No, Barbara, it's about... 

16:55.303 --> 16:59.343
Ari, she going to quit if we
don't give her what she wants.

16:59.378 --> 17:02.813
- She said that?
- Yes, and I'd hate to lose her.

17:04.582 --> 17:06.648
- But she's not ready.
- Band threatening to quit

17:06.684 --> 17:08.584
'cause she didn't get her way proves that.

17:08.617 --> 17:10.685
Everyone knows I don't respond to threats.

17:10.720 --> 17:13.055
And neither should you.
I'm calling her bluff.

17:13.089 --> 17:14.990
She's gonna be a superstar, Ari.

17:15.023 --> 17:16.523
I'm calling her bluff.

17:16.558 --> 17:19.660
So tell her to show us her goddamn cards.

17:19.694 --> 17:21.795
Maybe I should have a say in this too.

17:21.829 --> 17:24.030
You had your say and you were overruled.

17:24.064 --> 17:25.864
You don't get to overrule me!

17:25.898 --> 17:29.267
Barbara, this girl caused
the demise of my best friend.

17:29.302 --> 17:32.403
You take up her cause now
and it'll be the demise of us.

17:32.438 --> 17:34.405
Tell her to keep her pretty head down

17:34.439 --> 17:36.874
and when she's ready she'll get hers.

17:36.908 --> 17:38.975
Maybe I'll just tell her you're a jackass.

17:39.010 --> 17:41.878
Oh, good cop, bad cop game. I like it.

17:41.912 --> 17:43.713
Maybe later we can role-play, huh?

17:43.747 --> 17:47.850
Is it just me or would you look
great in leather pants and a gag ball?

17:57.959 --> 18:01.328
A toast to bond for this fine wine.

18:01.362 --> 18:03.196
Yeah, I'm a dead person.

18:03.230 --> 18:04.830
Are you really afraid of Murray?

18:04.865 --> 18:07.032
Come on, like you said, I'm a client too.

18:07.067 --> 18:09.768
Fuck Murray. I am not afraid
of Murray. I'm afraid of Bond.

18:09.803 --> 18:11.303
We'll buy him more.

18:11.337 --> 18:13.772
"We'll buy him more." This is rare shit.

18:13.806 --> 18:15.940
I know, and rare shit tastes amazing.

18:15.975 --> 18:17.842
Yes, it does. Oh, well.

18:17.877 --> 18:20.178
- I'll just blame Murray.
- Now you're thinking.

18:20.212 --> 18:21.813
Come on, guys, are we playing or what?

18:21.847 --> 18:24.314
Yeah yeah yeah, we're
playing. Come on, let's play.

18:24.349 --> 18:26.517
One second. Turtle.

18:26.551 --> 18:29.486
- Where you going? Let's hang.
- Got to wash the cars.

18:29.521 --> 18:32.855
- Don't you have someone to do that for you?
- Cutting costs.

18:32.889 --> 18:35.024
All right, I'm back.

18:35.058 --> 18:37.059
- What are we playing?
- Truth or dare.

18:37.094 --> 18:38.694
That is my favorite game
in the whole wide world.

18:38.728 --> 18:40.929
Great, I'll go first. Truth.

18:40.963 --> 18:43.765
Okay, which one of us
do you want to fuck more?

18:43.799 --> 18:47.334
Really? You could ask me anything
and that's what you want to know?

18:47.369 --> 18:49.502
- Mm-hmm.
- Here's the good news, ladies.

18:49.536 --> 18:51.403
One way or another,
everyone's gonna get fucked.

18:51.438 --> 18:54.439
- Okay?
- All right.

18:54.474 --> 18:57.841
"Look at me. I think there's
a whole universe of women

18:57.876 --> 19:00.343
that would look at me as
better looking than you."

19:00.378 --> 19:02.712
"I'll agree, but while
we're living in this universe

19:02.746 --> 19:04.513
let's assume she was looking at me."

19:04.548 --> 19:07.515
"Assumption denied."

19:07.550 --> 19:10.018
- Maybe you are funny.
- That's what I learned today.

19:10.052 --> 19:13.420
The only problem I see
is I'm also good looking.

19:13.455 --> 19:15.856
So who are we gonna find to
play the second male lead?

19:15.890 --> 19:18.391
- I got a great idea.
- What? What is it?

19:18.426 --> 19:20.560
Let me see what I can do first.
I don't want to get you excited.

19:20.594 --> 19:22.795
I'm already excited. Look at me.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.463
Johnny, you really are
funny. You know what?

19:24.497 --> 19:26.564
Get out of here. I've got work to
do. I'll call you in a little bit.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.100
- All right, Phil.
- All right?

19:41.211 --> 19:43.111
Alex? How are you?

19:43.146 --> 19:45.480
- Not happy.
- What's wrong?

19:45.514 --> 19:47.615
Well, that check you
gave me... it bounced.

19:47.649 --> 19:49.450
Shit. I'm sorry. I should have called

19:49.484 --> 19:51.585
and told you to hold off
cashing it till tomorrow.

19:51.620 --> 19:54.888
- Yeah, you should have.
- Just some banking issues. I'll sort it out.

19:54.922 --> 19:56.722
When? 'Cause I really need the money.

19:56.756 --> 19:58.524
You can cash it tomorrow for sure.

19:58.558 --> 20:01.860
- But if it's an emergency I'll get it done today.
- Okay, thanks.

20:01.894 --> 20:03.695
You know what? It's fine.

20:03.729 --> 20:07.399
I'll wait till tomorrow. I just
thought you stop payment or something.

20:07.433 --> 20:09.034
- Why would I do that?
- I don't know.

20:09.068 --> 20:10.902
'Cause you didn't really want to pay me.

20:10.937 --> 20:12.537
Why do you think I'm such a bad guy?

20:12.572 --> 20:15.874
I don't. I've got trust
issues. I'm working on it.

20:15.909 --> 20:19.077
Sorry, I've got problems
too. All the girls just quit.

20:19.112 --> 20:21.080
What, did you try to fuck them also?

20:21.114 --> 20:24.215
- No, that was just you.
- So what's the problem

20:24.250 --> 20:27.051
Cutbacks. Business isn't great.

20:27.085 --> 20:29.252
I thought you were doing so well.

20:29.287 --> 20:32.221
I tend to project an air of
confidence. Makes the workers feel good.

20:32.255 --> 20:35.022
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It's not your problem.

20:35.057 --> 20:37.324
Well, it is if that check's
not really gonna clear.

20:37.359 --> 20:39.192
No, it'll be fine tomorrow.

20:39.227 --> 20:41.627
I know. I was just kidding... Sort of.

20:41.661 --> 20:43.895
You know what?

20:43.930 --> 20:46.097
If you want, you can come by
today. I can give you cash.

20:46.131 --> 20:48.132
Really? You sure?

20:48.167 --> 20:50.167
Totally. And I'll keep my hands to myself.

20:50.202 --> 20:52.537
- You'd better.
- All right, I'll see you in a little.

20:52.571 --> 20:54.305
Okay, bye.

20:54.339 --> 20:56.073
I feel good.

20:56.108 --> 20:58.542
Drama's good, Vince
seems happy. We're good.

20:58.576 --> 21:00.677
Are you convincing me or yourself?

21:00.712 --> 21:02.746
- Whoever it's working on.
- Neither.

21:02.781 --> 21:04.915
But you are right about one thing... 

21:04.949 --> 21:07.117
We are good.

21:07.152 --> 21:10.119
Actually, Drama's pretty good too.

21:10.153 --> 21:12.555
Well, what are you
thinking? Vince isn't okay?

21:12.589 --> 21:14.323
I don't know. Something's up.

21:14.357 --> 21:16.258
I mean, he shaves his head,

21:16.293 --> 21:18.895
forces Cassavetes to push
back his reshoot schedule.

21:18.929 --> 21:21.263
I think you just need
to get used to letting go

21:21.298 --> 21:23.365
and let Vince figure stuff out on his own.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.134
Yeah, you're right.

21:25.168 --> 21:27.002
I've got a great job, great fiancee.

21:27.037 --> 21:30.139
I probably should have
put you first, right?

21:30.173 --> 21:33.008
Yeah, you probably should.
I'm proud of you, babe.

21:33.042 --> 21:34.843
I love you.

21:34.878 --> 21:36.812
Relax, okay?

21:36.846 --> 21:38.647
We're gonna have a wonderful night.

21:38.682 --> 21:41.116
Everything's gonna be okay.

21:49.391 --> 21:51.793
- You guys want another drink?
- Oh yes, thank you.

21:51.827 --> 21:53.628
- Grab another bottle.
- All right.

21:53.663 --> 21:56.731
I like her. I like you. I like you more.

21:56.766 --> 22:00.102
Maybe you could come visit me
while I'm hotel living in Maui.

22:00.136 --> 22:02.804
- That would be amazing.
- It's paradise.

22:02.838 --> 22:05.806
The Four Seasons has the
most incredible infinity pool

22:05.840 --> 22:07.908
- overlooking the ocean.
- Hello?

22:07.942 --> 22:10.110
Hello. Come to the party. Sit, please.

22:10.144 --> 22:12.111
- No.
- What's up, Alex?

22:12.146 --> 22:14.047
- Let's go in here.
- Oh, sorry.

22:14.081 --> 22:16.749
Isn't that the girl that won't fuck him?

22:16.784 --> 22:19.952
- She was.
- Go, Turtle. Go, Turtle!

22:21.154 --> 22:23.790
All right, it's all
here. You can count it.

22:23.825 --> 22:26.826
- It's not counterfeit, is it?
- Not as far as I know.

22:26.861 --> 22:29.463
Thanks, I actually really needed this.

22:29.497 --> 22:32.900
- You and I both.
- Wow, you're really in bad shape, huh?

22:32.935 --> 22:35.369
I'll be all right.

22:35.403 --> 22:37.738
Um, listen,

22:37.772 --> 22:40.207
I've got a way we could
both make some money.

22:40.241 --> 22:42.242
You gonna sell my kidney
on the black market?

22:42.276 --> 22:44.044
I hadn't thought of that, but maybe.

22:45.546 --> 22:47.314
I actually have a friend

22:47.348 --> 22:49.850
I was gonna hook you
up with before I quit,

22:49.885 --> 22:51.652
but then I just said forget it.

22:51.687 --> 22:54.522
- What friend?
- This guy down in Mexico.

22:54.556 --> 22:56.825
I don't deal drugs, Alex.
I mean, I used to sell

22:56.859 --> 23:00.428
- some weed in High School, but not anymore.
- It's not drugs.

23:00.463 --> 23:02.097
What is it?

23:02.131 --> 23:05.100
Come down to Mexico with
me. I'll introduce you.

23:05.134 --> 23:07.669
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:10.940 --> 23:12.907
Okay, 10 more seconds.

23:12.942 --> 23:16.077
10, nine... 

23:16.111 --> 23:18.679
- ... Eight, seven... 
- It's my producer.

23:18.714 --> 23:20.681
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, John.

23:20.716 --> 23:23.284
You've got to speak up. It's kind
of loud in here. I can't hear you.

23:23.318 --> 23:25.820
John Stamos, John. Can you he that?

23:25.854 --> 23:29.124
- John Stamos?
- Yeah, think he could play the other guy?

23:29.158 --> 23:32.027
Maybe, I don't know. You think
he's better looking than me?

23:32.061 --> 23:35.163
Maybe, John. Anyway, he likes the
idea and the network loves him.

23:35.197 --> 23:37.967
They said if he's in, they're in.

23:38.001 --> 23:41.204
- So we're all in.
- He wants to meet you, approve you.

23:41.238 --> 23:43.373
- Stamos?
- Yeah.

23:43.407 --> 23:44.908
Needs to approve me?

23:44.942 --> 23:46.643
Come on, John, I'm gonna set this up.

23:46.678 --> 23:50.314
- This is really really good.
- Okay.

23:50.348 --> 23:52.749
- Aloha, baby.
- Aloha.

23:54.350 --> 23:55.783
Hey, Johnny, how'd it go?

23:55.817 --> 23:57.851
John Stamos may be my co-star.

23:57.886 --> 23:59.820
- Ooh, he's cute.
- Awesome.

23:59.854 --> 24:02.789
- Yeah, I'm gonna call E.
- Tell him to come by.

24:07.794 --> 24:10.461
- Yo.
- Phil thinks we can get John Stamos.

24:10.495 --> 24:13.262
- Oh, wow.
- You think he's better looking than me?

24:13.297 --> 24:16.532
Um, I don't know, Drama.

24:16.566 --> 24:17.866
Ask Sloan.

24:17.900 --> 24:19.667
- Drama.
- Ask her.

24:19.702 --> 24:23.304
Do you think John Stamos is
better looking than Drama?

24:24.439 --> 24:26.440
- No way.
- Shit.

24:26.474 --> 24:28.275
Hope the network thinks so.

24:28.310 --> 24:30.545
Yo, E, get your ass over here

24:30.579 --> 24:32.614
and come celebrate with the Chase men.

24:32.648 --> 24:34.415
I'm having dinner with Sloan.

24:34.449 --> 24:38.185
I didn't want to bother you, but
life is passing you by, buddy.

24:38.219 --> 24:40.521
- I'm happy right where I am.
- Vince!

24:40.555 --> 24:43.290
Vince, we're having a party.
Come on, get off the phone.

24:43.324 --> 24:45.525
Who's that? Is that Scott?
You guys still hanging?

24:45.560 --> 24:47.527
- Yeah.
- Watch out for him, Vince.

24:47.561 --> 24:50.129
Don't be paranoid. What am I, 12?

24:50.163 --> 24:53.265
Hey, is that E? Tell him we
might have found your next script.

24:53.299 --> 24:54.900
- What's he saying?
- Nothing.

24:54.934 --> 24:56.969
He introduced me to Randall Wallace today.

24:57.003 --> 24:59.237
He's got a potential movie for me.

24:59.272 --> 25:00.939
Hello?

25:00.973 --> 25:03.340
- Yeah.
- Vince, get off the phone.

25:03.375 --> 25:04.775
We're not done with our game yet.

25:04.809 --> 25:07.110
You know what, E? I've got to go.

25:11.182 --> 25:12.750
Go.

25:12.784 --> 25:14.918
I love you.

25:16.154 --> 25:18.822
Hello? Anyone home?

25:18.856 --> 25:21.524
What, everyone's mad at me now?

25:21.558 --> 25:23.559
No, I was never mad at you, daddy.

25:23.593 --> 25:25.260
I'm cool, dad.

25:25.294 --> 25:28.396
- Where's mommy?
- Kitchen, still mad.

25:30.099 --> 25:32.166
- Babs.
- She quit.

25:32.200 --> 25:35.836
Come on, where's she gonna go?

25:35.870 --> 25:39.239
I don't know, Ari. But my
guess is many will want her.

25:39.273 --> 25:42.141
I'm not gonna give her a
good recommendation, are you?

25:42.175 --> 25:43.876
I think this was a mistake, Ari.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.910
You've been heard.

25:45.945 --> 25:48.712
A big fucking mistake.

25:55.218 --> 25:56.752
- Baby.
- Hey.

25:56.786 --> 25:58.686
Got rid of Lizzie.

25:58.721 --> 26:01.055
What, you fired her?

26:01.090 --> 26:03.024
She's done. She's gone.

26:03.058 --> 26:06.493
- Well, now I feel bad.
- Well, don't.

26:06.528 --> 26:09.396
Honey, she'll be fine. What about us?

26:09.430 --> 26:11.731
Come on, baby.

26:19.605 --> 26:21.707
Yo, E. What's good?

26:21.741 --> 26:23.208
You tell me.

26:23.242 --> 26:25.576
You know what? Spending
some time with your boys,

26:25.610 --> 26:28.378
realizing maybe you're not as
soft as I've been treating you.

26:28.413 --> 26:31.047
- No.
- I think we should be friends.

26:31.081 --> 26:33.983
We can be friends, Scott. Just don't
bring Vince projects anymore, okay?

26:34.017 --> 26:35.284
I do that alone.

26:35.319 --> 26:38.121
Don't be territorial
with me. We both rep him.

26:38.155 --> 26:39.689
No, Scott, we don't.

26:39.724 --> 26:42.326
Whoa, hey, this is a team company, E.

26:42.360 --> 26:45.129
That all comes down from your
soon-to-be godfather-in-law.

26:45.163 --> 26:46.997
- Where's Vince?
- He is in the can.

26:47.031 --> 26:49.700
He got called out on a dare and
he's in there with two girls.

26:49.734 --> 26:51.435
You guys are playing truth or dare?

26:51.469 --> 26:54.171
"You're playing truth or dare?
" What, are you too mature?

26:54.205 --> 26:55.706
I've got an idea.

26:55.740 --> 26:58.108
I double dare you to
arm-wrestle me for Vince.

26:58.142 --> 27:00.677
Do you want to hit me as hard
as you can? 'Cause you can.

27:00.712 --> 27:03.347
I'll let you. Let's go punch
for punch. Shots in the face.

27:03.381 --> 27:04.881
- I go first.
- Careful, Scott.

27:04.916 --> 27:08.218
- E's pretty scrappy.
- Is he really?

27:08.252 --> 27:10.286
I'm not worried. Go ahead,
you take the first shot.

27:10.321 --> 27:12.155
I'm not gonna punch
you in the face, Scott.

27:12.189 --> 27:14.090
You're not? What if I do that? Then what?

27:14.125 --> 27:17.327
Great mother of God.

27:17.362 --> 27:20.763
- What happened?
- E broke it.

27:20.797 --> 27:24.233
That's not my hat, is it, bro?
