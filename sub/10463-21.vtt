WEBVTT

00:03.582 --> 00:05.426
Twenty, thirty, forty...

00:05.710 --> 00:08.721
I only got a buck forty,
so put those back.

00:08.879 --> 00:10.440
You always want to put
back the Ho-Ho's.

00:10.464 --> 00:11.483
I don't like 'em.

00:11.507 --> 00:13.568
And every morning we end up
with Ho-Ho's and a Freezee.

00:13.592 --> 00:16.979
...Artie, that's because
you love Freezees. Duh.

00:18.389 --> 00:19.898
Okay, make up your mind.

00:21.559 --> 00:22.661
Look, man, I got a gun,

00:22.685 --> 00:24.778
so don't even think
about turning around.

00:28.357 --> 00:30.743
Just empty the
register real slow.

00:31.318 --> 00:33.078
Do it now!

00:38.909 --> 00:40.544
No, I don't need a bag!

00:40.995 --> 00:42.254
Now get your head down.

00:42.371 --> 00:43.797
Get down!

00:47.334 --> 00:48.677
Whoa.

I mean, I thought we
had, you know, a thing,

01:34.423 --> 01:36.026
and then I find out
she's leaving my bed

01:36.050 --> 01:37.643
and crawling into
this other guy's.

01:38.010 --> 01:39.696
You're kidding. She
told you that?

01:39.720 --> 01:41.563
Well, I followed her.

01:41.972 --> 01:43.732
I know. I know. I know.

01:44.099 --> 01:46.443
Oh, wow. Perfect lipstick print.

01:47.603 --> 01:49.372
I mean, I thought
that, you know,

01:49.396 --> 01:51.124
this was going to be
the one, you know.

01:51.148 --> 01:53.376
And, I mean, she told
me I had a cute butt.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.202
What is that, if not serious
commitment, you know.

01:56.862 --> 01:58.673
Maybe you need to re-examine
your standards, Dudley.

01:58.697 --> 02:00.374
You know what I'm going
to miss the most?

02:00.574 --> 02:01.635
The sex.

02:01.659 --> 02:03.053
I mean, she was right next door.

02:03.077 --> 02:04.554
I even nicknamed her 2-C.

02:04.578 --> 02:07.339
You know, apartment 2-C. Heh?

02:07.414 --> 02:08.642
I admit it was a
little precious,

02:08.666 --> 02:09.893
but she ate it up.

02:09.917 --> 02:10.894
Only now I find out

02:10.918 --> 02:12.761
she's moved in with this guy,

02:12.837 --> 02:14.054
Chip.

02:14.213 --> 02:15.690
I mean, can you
believe she dumped me

02:15.714 --> 02:18.401
for a guy named Chip?

02:18.425 --> 02:19.444
She moved out?

02:19.468 --> 02:20.362
Yesterday.

02:20.386 --> 02:21.780
She took all my Dean
Martin CDs too.

02:21.804 --> 02:23.824
This is a treacherous, treacherous
woman we're dealing with here.

02:23.848 --> 02:25.659
- And get this. -Well, did
they rent her apartment?

02:25.683 --> 02:27.452
No. She was big into
throwing things,

02:27.476 --> 02:28.370
so there'll be a lot

02:28.394 --> 02:30.320
of patching and
painting, and uh...

02:30.563 --> 02:31.456
Wait a minute.

02:31.480 --> 02:32.707
I'm spilling my guts out here,

02:32.731 --> 02:34.241
and you're worried
about real estate.

02:35.442 --> 02:38.755
No. It's just, I looked
at four places today.

02:38.779 --> 02:40.632
And they're all either
too roach-infested

02:40.656 --> 02:42.249
or too far away.

02:43.117 --> 02:44.427
Your building's exactly
the kind of place

02:44.451 --> 02:45.794
I'm looking for.

02:46.704 --> 02:49.558
You and me? Neighbors? Really?

02:49.582 --> 02:51.226
Like before they kicked
me out of school?

02:51.250 --> 02:52.143
Mm.

02:52.167 --> 02:54.136
I'm all a-tingle.

02:56.922 --> 02:58.807
Salinger's. This is Dud.

02:59.383 --> 03:01.768
Oh, hi, babe. How are you?

03:02.177 --> 03:03.979
So we still on for tonight?

03:04.346 --> 03:05.782
Uh-huh.

03:05.806 --> 03:07.441
So you can sneak out okay?

03:07.725 --> 03:09.943
Great. I love you too.

03:11.061 --> 03:12.279
It's Kirsten.

03:17.109 --> 03:18.368
Hey.

03:18.527 --> 03:19.870
Okay.

03:20.070 --> 03:22.539
Now, what kind of
jacket was he wearing?

03:22.698 --> 03:24.374
- It was a sportscoat.
- It was a windbreaker.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.084
I saw him before you did.

03:26.869 --> 03:28.212
It was a sportscoat.

03:28.412 --> 03:30.297
Okay. Do you remember the color?

03:30.623 --> 03:31.882
- Blue.
- Green.

03:35.127 --> 03:36.303
Blue-green?

03:36.587 --> 03:37.981
Excuse me, Officer Windlan,

03:38.005 --> 03:40.150
but didn't the cashier
get a look at this guy?

03:40.174 --> 03:41.391
I'm afraid not.

03:41.759 --> 03:42.694
All we have to go on

03:42.718 --> 03:44.645
is Artie and Claudia's
description.

03:45.137 --> 03:47.949
Anything else, guys? Any
other distinguishing marks,

03:47.973 --> 03:49.191
scars?

03:50.100 --> 03:52.444
I, uh, really don't remember.

03:52.728 --> 03:53.862
I do.

03:54.605 --> 03:56.041
He was real tall

03:56.065 --> 03:57.417
and sort of pale-looking.

03:57.441 --> 03:59.243
Oh, and I think he had a beard.

03:59.860 --> 04:01.755
Maybe if we looked
at some mug shots.

04:01.779 --> 04:03.632
After you talk to
the sketch artist.

04:03.656 --> 04:05.207
And what about a line-up?

04:05.699 --> 04:06.917
A line-up?

04:06.992 --> 04:07.969
It's a possibility.

04:07.993 --> 04:09.137
And then we'll have to testify

04:09.161 --> 04:10.180
at his trial, right?

04:10.204 --> 04:11.139
Testify?

04:11.163 --> 04:12.641
And, hey, maybe we could sell

04:12.665 --> 04:14.049
the rights to our story.

04:16.877 --> 04:19.596
Joe gave me the seats.
They're in the second row.

04:19.630 --> 04:21.358
We're going to be able to,
like, count the sweat drops

04:21.382 --> 04:23.141
on Tim Hardaway's forehead.

04:25.552 --> 04:27.354
What do you think her
hair feels like?

04:28.847 --> 04:30.992
Will, you can't go
out with Kiki Nash.

04:31.016 --> 04:32.693
She's a walking pep rally.

04:32.851 --> 04:34.079
She'd make you spend
Saturday nights

04:34.103 --> 04:35.121
trying to figure out new ways

04:35.145 --> 04:36.530
to boost school spirit.

04:37.022 --> 04:38.490
I could live with that.

04:40.985 --> 04:42.244
Great. Bye-bye.

04:43.570 --> 04:44.746
Jill!

04:46.448 --> 04:47.583
Hi.

04:48.826 --> 04:50.387
Promise you won't laugh.

04:50.411 --> 04:51.587
At what?

04:55.874 --> 04:57.217
Dance marathon.

04:57.584 --> 04:58.969
Thirty-six hours this weekend.

04:59.211 --> 05:00.637
To raise money for the library.

05:01.171 --> 05:02.357
I have to do

05:02.381 --> 05:04.442
the posters, the music,
the decorations...

05:04.466 --> 05:05.726
You're running it?

05:06.844 --> 05:08.103
You promised.

05:08.220 --> 05:11.023
I'm not laughing. I'm
not laughing, um...

05:13.934 --> 05:15.235
I'm sorry.

05:15.269 --> 05:17.529
I hate you.

05:18.814 --> 05:20.542
I told you, Dr. Brooks wants me

05:20.566 --> 05:22.451
to get more involved
with my community.

05:22.526 --> 05:23.503
Well, yeah, but...

05:23.527 --> 05:25.203
I'm sure he means
going to things,

05:25.404 --> 05:26.923
you know, not running them.

05:26.947 --> 05:27.882
Well, how do you know?

05:27.906 --> 05:28.967
You weren't there
in my sessions.

05:28.991 --> 05:30.385
Well, no, but...

05:30.409 --> 05:31.627
from what you told me.

05:31.785 --> 05:33.638
Well, I haven't told
you everything,

05:33.662 --> 05:35.631
so you don't know.

05:36.123 --> 05:37.341
Oh.

05:38.250 --> 05:39.843
And that's because...

05:40.169 --> 05:41.688
you just haven't gotten
around to it, or...

05:41.712 --> 05:42.846
Bailey.

05:42.963 --> 05:45.233
Therapy is a very
private thing, okay.

05:45.257 --> 05:47.017
I know, yeah. Of course it is.

05:47.801 --> 05:48.737
Of course it is.

05:48.761 --> 05:51.855
But you should know that
you can talk to me.

05:52.347 --> 05:53.324
You know, if you want to.

05:53.348 --> 05:54.534
I mean, I'm here for you

05:54.558 --> 05:56.651
if you ever do need
to talk about it.

05:58.062 --> 05:59.488
You know what I need?

05:59.938 --> 06:01.114
What?

06:01.648 --> 06:03.126
Someone to put these up
in the science building

06:03.150 --> 06:04.294
before lunch.

06:04.318 --> 06:05.577
Thanks.

06:12.659 --> 06:13.762
I don't know.

06:13.786 --> 06:14.929
Oh, come on.

06:14.953 --> 06:16.139
$15.00 to enter,

06:16.163 --> 06:18.099
and the winner gets
to keep half the pot.

06:18.123 --> 06:20.175
Besides, we've never
danced together.

06:21.418 --> 06:24.137
Huh. How come we've
never danced together?

06:25.089 --> 06:26.306
I don't know.

06:27.549 --> 06:28.693
Wait a minute.

06:28.717 --> 06:30.143
That's the problem
here, isn't it?

06:30.302 --> 06:31.520
No.

06:32.262 --> 06:34.022
You can't dance, can you?

06:34.348 --> 06:37.359
It's not that I can't.
I just don't.

06:37.559 --> 06:38.828
Oh, my God. You can't dance.

06:38.852 --> 06:41.780
I... I didn't say I can't.

06:42.481 --> 06:44.574
That's so cute. I
love that about you.

06:44.608 --> 06:46.034
All right, well...

06:46.318 --> 06:47.545
And you're embarrassed too.

06:47.569 --> 06:48.630
Look, please, don't.

06:48.654 --> 06:49.871
That's even cuter.

06:51.448 --> 06:52.874
For God's sakes.

06:57.621 --> 07:00.006
Oh, damn.

07:00.749 --> 07:03.885
Oh, man, I was supposed to
pick up those numbers today.

07:04.211 --> 07:06.138
Oh, you know, for
people's backs.

07:07.047 --> 07:09.433
Well, I'm just going to
have to do that tomorrow.

07:09.550 --> 07:10.809
Sometime.

07:11.635 --> 07:13.270
When, I have no idea.

07:14.096 --> 07:15.281
You know what, Jill?

07:15.305 --> 07:17.023
You don't have to do all this.

07:17.683 --> 07:18.942
What is that supposed to mean?

07:19.893 --> 07:21.194
Nothing, but...

07:21.395 --> 07:23.665
I just think maybe
you should hold off

07:23.689 --> 07:25.157
on this kind of thing.

07:26.400 --> 07:27.909
What, you don't
think I can do it?

07:28.026 --> 07:29.327
That's not what I said.

07:30.070 --> 07:32.247
Give me a little credit, Bailey.
I'm not an idiot.

07:32.364 --> 07:33.508
No, I know.

07:33.532 --> 07:36.209
But you've never done
anything like this before,

07:36.743 --> 07:38.462
and with all you've
been going through.

07:38.704 --> 07:40.557
I mean, you were on speed,

07:40.581 --> 07:43.143
so I think the last thing
you should try and do

07:43.167 --> 07:46.511
is something that requires
you to stay up for 36 hours.

07:47.171 --> 07:48.513
God.

07:49.256 --> 07:50.557
What?

07:53.260 --> 07:54.936
What kind of boyfriend are you?

07:55.220 --> 07:56.448
You're supposed to
be supporting me,

07:56.472 --> 07:58.190
not telling me what I can't do.

08:04.229 --> 08:05.447
You're right.

08:06.356 --> 08:07.574
I'm sorry.

08:09.818 --> 08:13.288
I'm sorry. Will you forgive me?

08:15.574 --> 08:17.000
Stop, okay?

08:18.410 --> 08:19.628
What?

08:20.162 --> 08:21.922
Sex is not a solution.

08:24.791 --> 08:26.009
What?

08:26.877 --> 08:28.762
It's one of the things Dr.
Brooks says.

08:31.006 --> 08:32.724
Oh, really.

08:34.426 --> 08:36.645
Well, does he tell you what
it's supposed to mean?

08:36.803 --> 08:38.188
Where's that number?

08:38.472 --> 08:39.698
Uh, yeah.

08:39.722 --> 08:40.700
It means I can't use sex

08:40.724 --> 08:42.400
to solve my problems anymore.

08:50.442 --> 08:53.286
See, I told you this was easy.

08:54.321 --> 08:55.622
Hmm.

09:24.601 --> 09:26.111
You're so warm.

09:38.490 --> 09:39.749
You okay?

09:40.325 --> 09:41.469
Yeah.

09:41.493 --> 09:42.961
You just tickled.

09:45.247 --> 09:46.423
Still?

09:46.790 --> 09:50.051
No. That feels nice.

10:07.102 --> 10:08.361
Well?

10:10.188 --> 10:12.282
Kitchen's pretty okay.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.118
And I'm sure it's
got good light.

10:15.611 --> 10:17.829
I think a new coat of paint
will really help a lot.

10:18.905 --> 10:20.133
You hate it.

10:20.157 --> 10:21.593
No, not it.

10:21.617 --> 10:23.084
Just the idea of it.

10:24.161 --> 10:26.212
Of you moving out, leaving them.

10:29.249 --> 10:30.184
I'm sorry,

10:30.208 --> 10:32.145
I know you want me to be
on board, Charlie, but...

10:32.169 --> 10:33.062
Kirsten.

10:33.086 --> 10:34.346
I need this.

10:35.255 --> 10:37.015
I really do. I need it.

10:37.924 --> 10:40.185
And it seems like so
little to want, you know?

10:40.636 --> 10:43.406
I know. I just...

10:43.430 --> 10:46.358
Look, we'd be seven minutes from the house.
I clocked it.

10:46.600 --> 10:47.702
I'll go by every morning,

10:47.726 --> 10:49.537
and I'll stop by every
night after work,

10:49.561 --> 10:50.955
and it'll be just
like it was before

10:50.979 --> 10:51.956
I officially moved back in,

10:51.980 --> 10:53.625
and that wasn't so bad.

10:53.649 --> 10:55.168
- We managed.
- Charlie...

10:55.192 --> 10:57.452
Kirsten, this would
be <i>our</i> place.

10:58.445 --> 11:00.548
Now, I could build you
some bookshelves.

11:00.572 --> 11:01.966
We could turn this
whole area over here

11:01.990 --> 11:04.292
into, like, a study for you.

11:05.035 --> 11:06.054
And everybody in this building,

11:06.078 --> 11:07.587
they're our age.

11:08.497 --> 11:10.674
It'd be fun, right?
Meet some new people.

11:12.459 --> 11:13.718
Think about it.

11:15.545 --> 11:17.263
We can sleep late.

11:18.548 --> 11:20.100
Have dinner in our underwear.

11:21.301 --> 11:23.237
Make love in the kitchen.

11:23.261 --> 11:24.479
In the shower.

11:25.514 --> 11:26.824
We can make love in
the middle of the day

11:26.848 --> 11:28.066
if we want...

11:28.100 --> 11:29.401
Right here.

11:30.560 --> 11:31.903
Right here, huh?

11:32.771 --> 11:35.865
No one would walk in
on us or hear us.

11:37.359 --> 11:38.910
Does the sofa come with?

11:38.944 --> 11:40.412
The last tenant left it.

11:41.696 --> 11:43.248
Pretty thoughtful, huh?

12:03.176 --> 12:05.937
So, uh, you're taking
all your stuff?

12:06.805 --> 12:08.491
Nope. Thought I'd
leave some clothes

12:08.515 --> 12:11.234
in case I end up staying over.

12:15.480 --> 12:16.865
Are you taking this?

12:17.566 --> 12:18.783
Nah.

12:21.528 --> 12:22.704
You want it?

12:24.656 --> 12:26.676
Hey, Officer Windlan
just called.

12:26.700 --> 12:28.052
They got some guy
matching the description.

12:28.076 --> 12:29.794
She needs you to come
down for a line-up.

12:30.954 --> 12:32.014
Can't Artie do it?

12:32.038 --> 12:33.548
She said they need you both.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.103
Go ahead and get dressed, Claud.
I'll meet you downstairs.

12:37.127 --> 12:38.595
That's okay. I got it.

12:38.712 --> 12:40.597
I'm sure you've got lots
of stuff you have to do.

12:41.214 --> 12:43.475
Well, actually, the apartment's
not even ready yet, so...

12:43.758 --> 12:46.946
Errands to run, last-minute
arrangements...

12:46.970 --> 12:48.406
This is probably just
one more headache

12:48.430 --> 12:50.190
you don't really need, right?

12:51.224 --> 12:53.234
So don't worry about it.
It's taken care of.

12:53.435 --> 12:54.569
Come on.

13:02.360 --> 13:04.370
All right, Claudia,
take your time.

13:06.573 --> 13:10.502
Maybe... num-number three.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.130
Number three, please
step forward.

13:15.665 --> 13:16.925
Can he see me?

13:17.459 --> 13:18.676
Can he, Bailey?

13:19.211 --> 13:21.898
Not a chance. There's
a two-way mirror,

13:21.922 --> 13:23.223
you know, like on TV.

13:23.423 --> 13:24.808
Oh, okay.

13:27.385 --> 13:29.395
No, his nose is too big.

13:31.139 --> 13:32.774
What about number four?

13:33.892 --> 13:37.320
No way. He's got that funny
bump thing on his head.

13:41.316 --> 13:42.909
Can I see number five?

13:43.652 --> 13:46.047
You know what, I'm going to
take a little risk here.

13:46.071 --> 13:48.289
Is number one the guy you saw?

13:51.201 --> 13:52.460
Uh...

13:54.496 --> 13:55.640
No.

13:55.664 --> 13:56.923
Then we're all done here.

13:57.249 --> 13:59.133
My tax dollars at work.

14:03.630 --> 14:05.441
Okay, so how long do they
have to be not moving

14:05.465 --> 14:06.359
before I disqualify them?

14:06.383 --> 14:08.611
Uh, 10 seconds, and then
just grab their number

14:08.635 --> 14:09.811
and kick them out.

14:09.886 --> 14:11.447
I'm not usually very aggressive.

14:11.471 --> 14:12.365
You'll learn.

14:12.389 --> 14:13.606
Okay.

14:15.141 --> 14:16.160
Hey.

14:16.184 --> 14:18.287
Hey! I thought you were
going to the game.

14:18.311 --> 14:19.247
Yeah, well.

14:19.271 --> 14:21.489
I figured, what the hell, I'll
catch the highlights on TV.

14:21.606 --> 14:22.750
Oh, uh-huh.

14:22.774 --> 14:24.492
God, this place looks great.

14:24.526 --> 14:25.910
Where are we putting the coats?

14:26.653 --> 14:27.839
Where are we putting the coats.

14:27.863 --> 14:29.247
Where are we putting the coats?

14:30.824 --> 14:32.333
- Um...
- You know what?

14:32.659 --> 14:33.803
Why don't you let
me do this for you?

14:33.827 --> 14:36.264
Oh, no. I kind of wanted to
sign in people personally.

14:36.288 --> 14:38.349
Well, yeah, but you should
probably open up a coat room.

14:38.373 --> 14:40.935
Uh, well, uh...

14:40.959 --> 14:43.011
Okay, okay, I guess.

14:43.712 --> 14:44.814
Okay.

14:44.838 --> 14:48.600
Now, what we need
here is a system.

14:49.301 --> 14:50.476
What?

14:50.635 --> 14:52.113
I'm not going to
take off my shirt

14:52.137 --> 14:53.030
in the middle of the gym.

14:53.054 --> 14:54.031
You've seen mine.

14:54.055 --> 14:54.949
Yeah, that's different,

14:54.973 --> 14:56.482
because your birthmark's
on your foot.

14:57.601 --> 14:58.703
Just lift it up.
No one's looking.

14:58.727 --> 14:59.745
No, no.

14:59.769 --> 15:01.321
- Please, come on.
- No.

15:01.771 --> 15:03.031
All right, fine.

15:06.401 --> 15:08.995
Oh, that's so cute. It's
shaped like a race car.

15:09.529 --> 15:10.464
Shut up.

15:10.488 --> 15:11.706
Well, it is.

15:20.957 --> 15:23.760
<i>Four hours down.
Thirty-two to go.</i>

15:24.085 --> 15:27.472
<i>So hang in there, guys.
Save up your energy.</i>

15:32.260 --> 15:33.362
I am gonna follow this

15:33.386 --> 15:36.356
with a solid hour of
hard-core thrash.

15:51.696 --> 15:52.715
Julia.

15:52.739 --> 15:54.499
What? I wasn't saying anything.

15:54.950 --> 15:56.052
Yeah, all right.

15:56.076 --> 15:57.377
Justin...

16:16.179 --> 16:18.449
God, his name is on
a dead brain cell.

16:18.473 --> 16:21.567
Big guy. What was it...
Ewell? Ezwell?

16:22.143 --> 16:23.871
I don't think I even
remember his real name.

16:23.895 --> 16:25.405
Everybody just
called him Trojan.

16:25.605 --> 16:28.116
Oh, yeah. Hey.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.244
He went to USC?

16:31.820 --> 16:32.713
Yeah, that was it.

16:32.737 --> 16:34.330
The, uh, the Trojans.

16:38.076 --> 16:39.053
It's, um...

16:39.077 --> 16:40.837
it's kind of a long story.

16:40.954 --> 16:42.463
Yeah.

16:45.041 --> 16:47.728
So you guys have a
lot of parties here?

16:47.752 --> 16:49.313
Oh, just the first
Saturday of every month.

16:49.337 --> 16:50.731
Hey, houseboat
next weekend, huh?

16:50.755 --> 16:51.931
Yeah.

16:52.048 --> 16:53.651
It's usually, uh, pretty quiet.

16:53.675 --> 16:55.277
See, we can get a
lot of work done.

16:55.301 --> 16:56.769
No distractions.

16:57.178 --> 16:58.521
I was just asking.

17:13.486 --> 17:14.871
Help me.

17:19.576 --> 17:21.169
Look, Mr. Fountain,

17:21.661 --> 17:22.637
this can't be the first time

17:22.662 --> 17:24.881
someone's spiked the
punch bowl at a dance.

17:25.330 --> 17:26.590
Someone spiked the punch?

17:27.041 --> 17:28.384
Yes, okay?

17:28.752 --> 17:30.521
Look, we found out about it,

17:30.545 --> 17:31.689
we threw it out.

17:31.713 --> 17:33.566
Why can't you just get
off my case about this?

17:33.590 --> 17:35.234
Jill, I'm the chaperon.

17:35.258 --> 17:36.152
Being on your case

17:36.176 --> 17:37.477
is my job tonight.

17:38.178 --> 17:39.729
Great. This should be fun.

17:40.055 --> 17:41.157
Uh...

17:41.181 --> 17:42.357
You know what?

17:42.474 --> 17:45.161
Jill told me to keep
an eye on the punch,

17:45.185 --> 17:47.204
so this whole thing
is really my fault.

17:47.228 --> 17:49.457
Okay, if it happens again,

17:49.481 --> 17:52.033
I'm shutting this
whole thing down.

17:57.322 --> 17:58.915
What? I was helping.

17:58.948 --> 18:00.375
I can fight my own fights.

18:00.617 --> 18:01.594
You were making him mad.

18:01.618 --> 18:03.095
Yeah, so he was making me mad.

18:03.119 --> 18:04.930
You just have to be careful
how you talk to people.

18:04.954 --> 18:06.390
Oh, thank you, Bailey.

18:06.414 --> 18:08.383
Excuse me. I'm gonna
make a note of that.

18:08.792 --> 18:09.926
Jerk.

18:23.848 --> 18:25.525
Listen up, everybody.

18:27.519 --> 18:28.871
Okay, um...

18:28.895 --> 18:30.623
We're gonna take a
short break right now,

18:30.647 --> 18:32.625
so you can all wet your whistles

18:32.649 --> 18:34.335
and empty your bladders,

18:34.359 --> 18:38.037
but, uh, anyone who isn't back
here in exactly five minutes

18:38.530 --> 18:39.997
is disqualified.

18:40.490 --> 18:42.009
You know what? I'm gonna
get rid of this shirt.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.010
Okay.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.095
You thirsty?

18:44.119 --> 18:45.054
I'll get us something.

18:45.078 --> 18:47.004
Oh... I don't have any money.

18:48.706 --> 18:49.892
Here you go.

18:49.916 --> 18:51.175
Thanks.

19:18.695 --> 19:20.339
Sorry, I'm all sweaty.

19:20.363 --> 19:21.706
Oh, it's okay.

19:23.116 --> 19:24.093
It's gonna be

19:24.117 --> 19:25.845
like you're in some kind
of a floating conga line.

19:25.869 --> 19:27.763
Now, there's gonna be eight
of us on the houseboat,

19:27.787 --> 19:28.681
but it sleeps 12,

19:28.705 --> 19:30.214
so there's plenty of room.

19:31.124 --> 19:32.425
What do you think?

19:33.418 --> 19:35.312
Uh, well, actually,

19:35.336 --> 19:37.555
I'm pretty buried next weekend.

19:37.589 --> 19:39.390
And you got that
thing, remember?

19:40.008 --> 19:41.068
What thing?

19:41.092 --> 19:42.477
You know, for Claudia.

19:42.844 --> 19:44.187
Her recital.

19:44.888 --> 19:46.731
Oh, uh, that. Right.

19:47.682 --> 19:49.451
Well, it's your loss, guys.

19:49.475 --> 19:50.578
I mean, it's gonna be a blast.

19:50.602 --> 19:51.579
It's gonna be three days

19:51.603 --> 19:54.363
of nothing but
drifting and drinking.

19:54.606 --> 19:55.666
Hello.

19:55.690 --> 19:56.584
Now's my chance.

19:56.608 --> 19:59.535
The girl from 3-E is all alone.

19:59.652 --> 20:01.046
Can I have a butt-check here?

20:01.070 --> 20:02.089
Did I sit in anything?

20:02.113 --> 20:03.090
All clear.

20:03.114 --> 20:04.373
Beautiful.

20:08.411 --> 20:09.712
Claudia's recital?

20:09.746 --> 20:11.547
I was giving you an out.

20:11.998 --> 20:13.216
For what?

20:13.958 --> 20:15.811
Drifting and drinking?

20:15.835 --> 20:17.803
It doesn't sound like
your kind of weekend.

20:18.838 --> 20:20.858
Maybe if you tried
to have a good time.

20:20.882 --> 20:24.477
I did, but I'm ready to go home.

20:25.094 --> 20:26.155
What are you talking about?

20:26.179 --> 20:27.396
It's still early.

20:29.015 --> 20:31.776
Okay, you want to
stay, I want to go,

20:32.393 --> 20:34.038
so get Dud to give
you a ride home.

20:34.062 --> 20:36.197
- Kirsten...
- I want to go home, Charlie.

20:41.527 --> 20:42.787
Fine.

20:44.697 --> 20:46.165
Drive safely.

20:46.699 --> 20:47.676
Yeah.

20:47.700 --> 20:48.834
You too.

21:32.370 --> 21:33.713
What's going on?

21:33.746 --> 21:35.339
She had a nightmare.

21:37.208 --> 21:39.635
She finally fell
asleep around 3:30.

21:40.962 --> 21:43.055
Boy, this robbery
really freaked her out.

21:45.049 --> 21:46.684
Well, I'll talk to
her in the morning.

21:48.761 --> 21:50.313
Did you have a good time?

21:53.182 --> 21:55.693
I would've had a better
time if you had been there.

21:56.477 --> 21:58.571
Then Claudia would've
been here by herself.

21:58.938 --> 22:00.239
No, she wouldn't have.

22:00.690 --> 22:01.583
Bill's here till midnight,

22:01.607 --> 22:03.743
and we would've been
back here before then.

22:04.235 --> 22:06.829
But since you left early...

22:10.950 --> 22:12.251
Hey, I can do this.

22:12.744 --> 22:13.637
I can have fun.

22:13.661 --> 22:14.805
I can have an actual life

22:14.829 --> 22:16.307
and still be on top of
things here, Kirsten.

22:16.331 --> 22:17.548
I really can.

22:19.834 --> 22:21.312
And I know exactly
what to do for her,

22:21.336 --> 22:23.012
what she needs, and
I'll take care of it.

22:24.380 --> 22:26.307
This is a Safetek lock.

22:26.674 --> 22:28.351
Ir cost me over 200 bucks.

22:30.511 --> 22:32.897
You'd need a Scud missile
to break this thing.

22:33.639 --> 22:36.025
Well, that's... good.

22:36.142 --> 22:37.828
And I got these bolts
for the windows,

22:37.852 --> 22:39.121
12 bucks apiece,

22:39.145 --> 22:41.489
and if that's not enough,
we'll put up burglar bars.

22:41.606 --> 22:42.907
I don't know.

22:43.149 --> 22:44.950
Burglar bars are kind of ugly.

22:45.568 --> 22:47.995
Still, whatever it takes
to make you feel safe.

22:48.988 --> 22:51.800
Okay, to unlock it, use
this key for the top one.

22:51.824 --> 22:52.760
Okay.

22:52.784 --> 22:55.846
That undoes the deadbolt, and
then you unlock the lock.

22:55.870 --> 22:57.046
Oh.

22:59.874 --> 23:01.550
Perp's in custody.

23:02.210 --> 23:03.437
Excuse me?

23:03.461 --> 23:04.804
It's cop talk.

23:05.046 --> 23:06.732
They caught the guy, and
there isn't gonna be

23:06.756 --> 23:08.724
any line-up or
trial or anything.

23:09.300 --> 23:10.360
There isn't?

23:10.384 --> 23:11.894
He confessed.

23:11.969 --> 23:15.106
He's going to jail, and we don't
even get to testify against him.

23:19.727 --> 23:20.996
<i>This whole thing is a mess.</i>

23:21.020 --> 23:23.697
I should have left it to someone
else who knew what they were doing.

23:23.898 --> 23:25.533
Get out of here.
It's been great.

23:26.609 --> 23:28.212
Don't lie to me out of pity.

23:28.236 --> 23:29.912
That would be too depressing.

23:30.696 --> 23:31.914
I'm not.

23:32.490 --> 23:33.592
Honestly, you don't know this

23:33.616 --> 23:35.969
because you've never
came to dances before,

23:35.993 --> 23:37.545
but they're always a mess.

23:37.703 --> 23:38.972
The only thing different
about this one

23:38.996 --> 23:40.881
is, for once, the
music doesn't suck.

23:41.207 --> 23:43.050
You think? Because...

23:43.668 --> 23:46.480
I spent almost my entire
day rounding up CDs.

23:46.504 --> 23:47.689
Well, yeah.

23:47.713 --> 23:48.982
And all the stuff
you've done on the mic

23:49.006 --> 23:50.734
has been really funny.
I mean, you should be

23:50.758 --> 23:52.435
a stand-up comedian
or something.

23:53.052 --> 23:56.740
Well, I guess if I could make
it through 36 hours of this,

23:56.764 --> 23:58.107
I could probably do anything.

24:00.268 --> 24:02.319
Jill, let me ask you something.

24:02.937 --> 24:04.238
Um...

24:05.106 --> 24:08.544
do you think most guys in school
carry condoms in their wallets?

24:08.568 --> 24:10.661
Or, you know, just a few, or...

24:11.195 --> 24:12.997
Well, how many do
you think do that?

24:13.281 --> 24:14.498
Um...

24:14.532 --> 24:16.083
I don't know.

24:16.450 --> 24:18.252
How many guys are having sex?

24:20.663 --> 24:22.339
Oh, damn.

24:22.456 --> 24:24.017
If you're not out
there in 40 seconds,

24:24.041 --> 24:25.634
you're disqualified!

24:38.347 --> 24:39.324
Hey!

24:39.348 --> 24:40.701
Sorry, Will. You know the rules.

24:40.725 --> 24:42.077
You both have to be moving.

24:42.101 --> 24:43.620
- We were.
- No.

24:43.644 --> 24:45.873
Kiki was kind of rocking
from one foot to the other,

24:45.897 --> 24:47.457
but you, you were just
standing there kissing her

24:47.481 --> 24:48.866
for two solid minutes.

24:48.900 --> 24:50.284
I clocked you.

24:50.610 --> 24:52.453
Great. Thanks a lot.

24:53.404 --> 24:54.965
My tongue was moving.

24:54.989 --> 24:56.415
That counts.

24:56.949 --> 24:59.043
Make sure you ice that
when you get home, okay?

25:01.078 --> 25:02.421
You know what?

25:02.997 --> 25:04.266
This whole thing's
starting to remind me

25:04.290 --> 25:06.393
of this movie I saw once on TV.

25:06.417 --> 25:08.636
Which one? <i>They Shoot
Horses, Don't They?</i>

25:08.920 --> 25:10.221
<i>Carrie.</i>

25:10.546 --> 25:12.139
<i>Uh, excuse me.</i>

25:12.465 --> 25:15.142
<i>People, can I have your
attention, please?</i>

25:15.384 --> 25:16.769
<i>Okay, listen up.</i>

25:17.345 --> 25:18.896
Go away, Will.

25:19.805 --> 25:21.106
<i>Um...</i>

25:21.432 --> 25:23.535
<i>Okay, it has come
to my attention</i>

25:23.559 --> 25:25.829
<i>that some coats are missing
from the locker room,</i>

25:25.853 --> 25:28.665
<i>so if you accidentally
took them,</i>

25:28.689 --> 25:30.209
<i>please return them, okay?</i>

25:30.233 --> 25:32.743
<i>And if you stole
them on purpose,</i>

25:33.486 --> 25:35.120
<i>which is probably more the case,</i>

25:35.571 --> 25:36.914
<i>you suck.</i>

25:39.784 --> 25:41.335
She doesn't usually
talk like that.

25:41.744 --> 25:42.971
Bailey, I've got a feeling

25:42.995 --> 25:45.005
the fun curve is
leveling off here.

25:45.039 --> 25:46.016
Now, what would you think

25:46.040 --> 25:47.976
of making this a
24-hour marathon

25:48.000 --> 25:49.436
instead of a 36?

25:49.460 --> 25:51.146
I think I'd drop
down to my knees

25:51.170 --> 25:52.397
and kiss your feet.

25:52.421 --> 25:54.348
Well, that I can live without.

26:04.892 --> 26:06.370
Mr. Fountain caught
Scottie and Rita

26:06.394 --> 26:08.654
having sex in the shower
in the girls' locker room.

26:10.564 --> 26:12.157
You're kidding.

26:13.651 --> 26:15.170
They got disqualified.

26:15.194 --> 26:17.413
It doesn't seem fair, though.
They were moving.

26:18.614 --> 26:20.874
You know what, Justin?
I'm really tired.

26:21.867 --> 26:24.545
What? You want to quit?

26:24.662 --> 26:26.765
Well, we're not gonna make it
through all 36 hours anyway,

26:26.789 --> 26:29.883
so we might as well quit
now and get some sleep.

26:31.294 --> 26:33.021
Wait a minute.
What's the problem?

26:33.045 --> 26:36.233
I mean, you're the one that was into
this whole thing the whole time.

26:36.257 --> 26:37.433
What happened?

26:38.050 --> 26:39.736
Nothing. I just
want to go to bed.

26:39.760 --> 26:43.272
You... What is it?
What's the problem?

26:44.765 --> 26:46.150
You know what?

26:46.267 --> 26:47.703
I'm tired, and I'm hungry,

26:47.727 --> 26:49.746
and I'm kind of
getting sick of this,

26:49.770 --> 26:51.280
so I'm leaving.

26:59.780 --> 27:00.716
I thought you'd agree.

27:00.740 --> 27:01.883
What, are you stupid?

27:01.907 --> 27:03.135
I work my ass off on something,

27:03.159 --> 27:04.752
you think I'm just
gonna call it off?

27:05.328 --> 27:06.680
We're not canceling it, Jill.

27:06.704 --> 27:09.089
We're just gonna stop it
before it gets out of hand.

27:09.457 --> 27:11.893
What makes you think it will?
Huh?

27:11.917 --> 27:13.729
Come on, Jill. Come on.

27:13.753 --> 27:15.981
Everyone's cranky,
you're exhausted.

27:16.005 --> 27:16.940
Okay, all right, fine.

27:16.964 --> 27:18.317
Maybe this thing's a
little bit of a mess.

27:18.341 --> 27:19.318
but you know what, Bailey?

27:19.342 --> 27:21.486
It's my mess, this
whole thing was mine,

27:21.510 --> 27:22.738
and all night long,
you've been trying

27:22.762 --> 27:23.864
to take it away from me.

27:23.888 --> 27:26.106
- I have not.
- You have too!

27:26.307 --> 27:27.784
From the moment you
got here tonight,

27:27.808 --> 27:29.161
you've just been waiting
for me to screw up

27:29.185 --> 27:30.329
so you could fix it.

27:30.353 --> 27:31.246
I mean, God!

27:31.270 --> 27:34.823
The punch, the cash box,
even the microphone.

27:35.024 --> 27:36.335
There was feedback!

27:36.359 --> 27:37.377
So what?

27:37.401 --> 27:39.504
Maybe I like
feedback, all right?

27:39.528 --> 27:41.631
Maybe I want to fix
the feedback myself.

27:41.655 --> 27:44.009
Maybe I want to look
at this whole thing

27:44.033 --> 27:45.260
however it turns out, and say,

27:45.284 --> 27:47.888
"You know what? I did
that all by myself."

27:47.912 --> 27:49.264
You said you wanted
me in your corner.

27:49.288 --> 27:52.716
Yes, in my corner,
not in my face.

28:00.716 --> 28:02.017
Oh, man!

28:02.760 --> 28:04.019
That's...

28:04.470 --> 28:05.781
Again.

28:05.805 --> 28:06.980
Whoa.

28:08.099 --> 28:09.368
I'm out of practice.

28:09.392 --> 28:11.193
Yeah, I know. Getting
old sucks, huh?

28:12.645 --> 28:13.987
To Big Sur.

28:15.022 --> 28:16.448
To Big Sur.

28:17.066 --> 28:20.587
The lost weekend.
36 hours, nonstop.

28:20.611 --> 28:22.079
Tell me you remember.

28:22.571 --> 28:25.666
We camped on the
beach or something?

28:26.242 --> 28:27.761
Yeah, only because
you got so drunk,

28:27.785 --> 28:29.962
you lost your car
keys and your wallet.

28:31.914 --> 28:33.725
But we met up with those
girls from Tahoe.

28:33.749 --> 28:34.810
That was pretty cool.

28:34.834 --> 28:36.603
Yeah, until you
threw up on them.

28:36.627 --> 28:38.146
Dud, I did not throw up on them.

28:38.170 --> 28:39.314
Well, you hit their shoes.

28:39.338 --> 28:41.149
I believe that counts
in Olympic rules.

28:41.173 --> 28:42.850
Now, come on. Drink 'em up.

28:49.014 --> 28:50.566
We didn't get back in time.

28:50.808 --> 28:53.495
We blew that Stonestown bid
by, like, three hours.

28:53.519 --> 28:55.237
That would have
been a great gig.

28:55.479 --> 28:57.239
We could have made
a lot of money.

29:00.693 --> 29:02.786
Hey, well, what the hell?
It was worth it, right?

29:02.862 --> 29:04.121
What a blast.

29:38.731 --> 29:40.417
<i>Claud, it's not about that.</i>

29:40.441 --> 29:42.117
<i>- It's not about you.</i>

29:42.193 --> 29:43.295
<i>It's just something I need...</i>

29:43.319 --> 29:44.578
Hello?

29:49.116 --> 29:51.627
<i>And you know what? Things will not
be all that different around here.</i>

29:52.328 --> 29:53.712
Hello?

30:16.894 --> 30:18.112
Jule?

30:20.689 --> 30:22.157
Oh, God.

30:23.859 --> 30:25.160
What time is it?

30:25.903 --> 30:27.287
8:15.

30:28.864 --> 30:30.008
Oh...

30:30.032 --> 30:31.959
- You okay?
- No.

30:35.704 --> 30:38.423
I was supposed to open up for
the produce guy at 6:00.

30:39.708 --> 30:41.301
I promised Joe.

30:41.794 --> 30:43.095
I have to call him.

30:43.754 --> 30:45.055
Oh, God.

30:46.131 --> 30:47.683
I don't have my phone.

30:48.384 --> 30:50.144
I can't believe I did this.

30:50.302 --> 30:51.770
He's gonna kill me.

30:52.137 --> 30:53.772
If this is a bad time...

30:53.889 --> 30:55.232
No, no.

30:56.767 --> 30:59.027
I'd ask you to sit down,
but I can't move.

30:59.603 --> 31:00.863
That's okay.

31:02.439 --> 31:04.324
I just wanted to see
your new place.

31:05.276 --> 31:06.253
It's nice.

31:06.277 --> 31:08.203
It reminds me of that
place you had on Potrero.

31:10.865 --> 31:12.968
Anyways, Kirsten told me

31:12.992 --> 31:14.918
you stayed over here last night.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.130
It was kind of weird
because I thought,

31:19.081 --> 31:21.216
"Wow. This is really it."

31:24.211 --> 31:26.847
You make it sound like we're not
going to see each other ever again.

31:28.465 --> 31:29.892
It will be different.

31:30.718 --> 31:33.312
I mean, you won't be right
down the hall anymore.

31:34.138 --> 31:37.941
And I know things weren't
perfect between us,

31:39.101 --> 31:40.819
but it was getting better,

31:40.853 --> 31:42.321
and that was nice.

31:42.813 --> 31:44.072
And I'll miss it.

31:44.982 --> 31:46.533
And I'll miss you.

31:50.487 --> 31:52.039
Right. Well...

31:54.241 --> 31:58.555
If you ever need something,
or you just want to talk...

31:58.579 --> 32:00.380
Good. That's good.

32:01.332 --> 32:03.476
I mean, it's not like I'll
be over here all the time,

32:03.500 --> 32:06.845
you know, but maybe
sometimes if I have, like,

32:06.962 --> 32:08.805
a question or something...

32:11.592 --> 32:13.060
What is it, Jule?

32:13.677 --> 32:16.605
Nothing... specific.

32:18.849 --> 32:20.994
I mean, you're older,

32:21.018 --> 32:22.903
and you know a lot of things.

32:23.437 --> 32:24.414
Oh, yeah.

32:24.438 --> 32:26.323
I'm wise beyond my years.

32:28.901 --> 32:30.202
Well...

32:30.736 --> 32:31.796
you know what it's like

32:31.820 --> 32:35.415
when two people are really,
really attracted to each other.

32:36.283 --> 32:37.677
I mean, you've had a
lot of experience

32:37.701 --> 32:39.044
with that, right?

32:40.829 --> 32:42.464
Is this about sex?

32:42.790 --> 32:44.007
No.

32:47.336 --> 32:49.763
I mean, yeah, it is...

32:50.923 --> 32:52.307
about sex.

32:54.051 --> 32:56.061
I just really need
to talk to you.

32:57.888 --> 32:59.147
So...

33:00.391 --> 33:01.733
Let's talk.

33:11.902 --> 33:13.046
Bailey.

33:13.070 --> 33:14.454
You weren't in school.

33:15.572 --> 33:16.675
Yeah.

33:16.699 --> 33:18.385
I raised 900 bucks
for the library,

33:18.409 --> 33:20.043
so I got excused.

33:24.498 --> 33:25.882
What do you want?

33:27.751 --> 33:29.678
I want to feel like
you want me around,

33:31.422 --> 33:33.390
because I don't feel
like that anymore.

33:35.092 --> 33:36.810
The thing is, Bailey...

33:37.803 --> 33:39.447
I'm trying to do this thing...

33:39.471 --> 33:42.566
I know, and I want to help you.

33:42.599 --> 33:44.151
And I don't need it.

33:44.351 --> 33:46.746
If I'm gonna really,
finally kick drugs,

33:46.770 --> 33:50.115
I have to feel like I can
handle things by myself,

33:50.232 --> 33:51.783
without getting high,

33:52.067 --> 33:53.294
without having sex,

33:53.318 --> 33:55.162
without running to you.

33:56.405 --> 33:58.081
I like you running to me.

33:58.949 --> 34:01.710
Well... I can't do it anymore.

34:03.579 --> 34:06.548
I have to take care of
my problems myself.

34:06.999 --> 34:09.092
You can understand
that, can't you?

34:15.257 --> 34:16.558
So...

34:17.760 --> 34:18.737
So, what?

34:18.761 --> 34:22.898
I can't even, like, change
a flat tire for you?

34:23.306 --> 34:24.608
Nope.

34:25.726 --> 34:27.985
But you can teach me how
to change one myself.

34:29.228 --> 34:30.447
Okay?

34:33.025 --> 34:34.326
Okay.

34:40.532 --> 34:42.083
Uh, wait a minute.

34:42.409 --> 34:43.793
Hmm?

34:45.079 --> 34:50.935
Are there, like, problems
here that need to be solved?

34:50.958 --> 34:52.062
Mm...

34:52.085 --> 34:55.263
No, I'm feeling fairly
okay about things.

34:58.842 --> 35:00.268
So you're not...

35:01.678 --> 35:04.189
You're not, like, feeling like
a basket case or anything?

35:08.560 --> 35:10.445
And if I, um...

35:12.106 --> 35:14.491
maybe kissed you,

35:15.192 --> 35:16.211
that-that would be...

35:16.235 --> 35:17.911
That would be fine.

35:19.071 --> 35:20.622
That would be great.

35:34.128 --> 35:36.471
Hi. What are you doing home?

35:36.797 --> 35:38.181
It's a school day.

35:38.674 --> 35:41.017
I just have a little
bruise on my forehead.

35:41.468 --> 35:43.228
Mrs. Hartsell sent me home.

35:46.014 --> 35:47.399
Let me see.

35:49.643 --> 35:52.112
Hmm. What happened?

35:52.354 --> 35:55.407
I sort of fell asleep in
the middle of geography.

35:56.942 --> 35:58.577
I hit my head on my desk.

36:00.612 --> 36:02.205
In the middle of geography, huh?

36:03.448 --> 36:06.251
What do you think that is,
boredom, or something else?

36:06.869 --> 36:09.087
Well, I'm having a
little trouble sleeping.

36:09.997 --> 36:11.923
I keep having these nightmares.

36:12.875 --> 36:14.759
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:14.793 --> 36:16.178
Last night again?

36:18.297 --> 36:19.691
They caught the guy, Claud.

36:19.715 --> 36:22.986
I mean, he's in jail.
You're completely safe.

36:23.010 --> 36:24.853
There's really nothing
to worry about anymore.

36:25.137 --> 36:26.271
I know.

36:28.015 --> 36:30.984
So what are we going
to do about this?

36:31.560 --> 36:33.737
They say it makes it
better to talk about it.

36:39.693 --> 36:41.077
Okay.

36:41.737 --> 36:44.039
Well, I'm in the house, right?

36:44.323 --> 36:46.634
And it's, like,
completely empty,

36:46.658 --> 36:49.252
and everything's really
creepy, you know?

36:49.870 --> 36:51.630
And I can hear you talking,

36:51.914 --> 36:53.057
and I'm, like,
running after you,

36:53.081 --> 36:54.508
but I can't find you.

36:54.750 --> 36:56.186
And every time I open a new door

36:56.210 --> 36:57.312
to a new room,

36:57.336 --> 36:58.762
it's completely empty,

36:59.796 --> 37:01.181
and your voice...

37:02.257 --> 37:03.443
Your voice keeps getting softer

37:03.467 --> 37:05.268
and softer and softer.

37:09.348 --> 37:11.399
So there's no guy
with a gun, huh?

37:12.726 --> 37:14.069
Nope.

37:16.355 --> 37:18.073
What's it mean, Charlie?

37:19.983 --> 37:21.409
I mean, do you know?

37:23.654 --> 37:24.913
Yeah.

37:26.573 --> 37:27.958
I think so.

37:37.292 --> 37:38.269
So a funny thing happened

37:38.293 --> 37:39.886
on the way to school
this morning.

37:41.922 --> 37:42.941
I felt bad about our fight,

37:42.965 --> 37:44.359
so I was going to
buy you a flower

37:44.383 --> 37:45.642
and put it in your locker,

37:46.343 --> 37:47.612
and I went to pay for it,

37:47.636 --> 37:49.187
and I pulled out my wallet...

37:52.182 --> 37:53.243
It was the first thing I saw,

37:53.267 --> 37:55.694
so it must have been the
first thing you saw too.

37:57.771 --> 37:58.989
Yeah.

38:01.191 --> 38:05.912
So the fact that I have that,
does that make you mad at me?

38:16.081 --> 38:20.260
I don't know. It just kind
of made me feel weird.

38:22.045 --> 38:23.680
Weird? Like, weird how?

38:24.464 --> 38:25.525
I don't want to make you think

38:25.549 --> 38:28.393
that I'm ready for
that when I'm not.

38:29.594 --> 38:31.823
Because even though I know
you love me and all that,

38:31.847 --> 38:36.735
when I think about
that, I still, uh...

38:37.269 --> 38:39.779
Do stupid things like
quit dance marathons?

38:42.190 --> 38:43.366
Yeah.

38:45.277 --> 38:49.331
So I kind of think that means not yet...
you know?

39:01.460 --> 39:02.719
Look,

39:04.004 --> 39:05.889
the only reason that I have that

39:06.006 --> 39:09.319
is because I figure someday,

39:09.343 --> 39:11.654
maybe... maybe soon, maybe not,

39:11.678 --> 39:13.355
we might want to use it,

39:15.182 --> 39:18.494
and I'm not, like, in a big rush

39:18.518 --> 39:20.695
or anything, all right?

39:22.981 --> 39:23.916
I don't know.

39:23.940 --> 39:26.826
It just all feels
so complicated.

39:31.239 --> 39:32.383
You know what?

39:32.407 --> 39:34.125
It's not that complicated.

39:35.118 --> 39:37.504
This stuff, this
fooling around stuff,

39:38.080 --> 39:39.140
it's amazing.

39:39.164 --> 39:42.008
I mean, I touch you, and
I feel it everywhere.

39:42.042 --> 39:45.637
It's like this, this big whoosh.

39:47.005 --> 39:48.431
I get that too.

39:48.548 --> 39:49.974
Yeah, and that's good.

39:50.217 --> 39:51.559
That's a good thing.

39:52.219 --> 39:53.529
So as long as we keep feeling

39:53.553 --> 39:55.188
that whoosh, we're okay.

39:56.932 --> 39:58.149
Right.

39:58.892 --> 39:59.952
Okay?

39:59.976 --> 40:01.996
And this is what we'll do.

40:02.020 --> 40:05.031
If you ever don't feel that...

40:05.273 --> 40:06.866
you just say so.

40:07.901 --> 40:09.796
Just say, "no whoosh"?

40:09.820 --> 40:11.496
"No whoosh," and we stop.

40:14.741 --> 40:16.000
Okay.

40:22.207 --> 40:23.675
It's warm.

40:25.836 --> 40:27.178
Yeah.

40:29.297 --> 40:30.974
I got an idea.

40:37.180 --> 40:38.857
I didn't bring my bathing suit.

40:39.015 --> 40:40.400
Neither did I.

41:04.666 --> 41:06.468
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:19.264 --> 41:20.565
Whoosh.

41:27.481 --> 41:28.865
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:29.316 --> 41:31.034
I'm a little late. I'm sorry.

41:33.904 --> 41:36.372
They were having this
garage sale down the block,

41:37.115 --> 41:38.958
and I found that
famous painting...

41:39.326 --> 41:41.377
you know the one with the
four dogs playing poker?

41:42.537 --> 41:44.506
And I didn't know whether
or not to get it for you.

41:45.248 --> 41:46.841
As a housewarming present?

41:46.958 --> 41:48.853
Well... yes.

41:48.877 --> 41:51.095
But that's the problem,

41:51.880 --> 41:55.776
because getting it for you
would mean that I was okay

41:55.800 --> 41:57.143
with you being here.

41:57.552 --> 41:59.572
On the other hand, not
getting it for you

41:59.596 --> 42:01.574
was like saying that
I didn't understand

42:01.598 --> 42:03.358
what having your own
place meant to you.

42:05.143 --> 42:07.821
So you didn't buy it?

42:08.480 --> 42:10.907
No, actually, I did.

42:13.276 --> 42:14.670
It's downstairs.

42:14.694 --> 42:17.372
I couldn't bring it up myself.
It's kind of huge.

42:19.324 --> 42:21.000
Will it fit in the
back of my truck?

42:25.705 --> 42:27.465
Turns out I've
already lived here.

42:28.750 --> 42:31.219
Oh, different apartment,
maybe, but...

42:32.837 --> 42:35.098
I've already lived the life
that I wanted to have here.

42:35.799 --> 42:38.476
The partying, the drinking,

42:38.677 --> 42:41.396
the staying out all night and
waking up with a hangover

42:42.013 --> 42:44.232
and some girl's
number in my pocket.

42:45.559 --> 42:47.026
I've been that guy,

42:48.520 --> 42:50.488
and I thought I wanted
to be him again.

42:52.607 --> 42:54.418
Turns out, and this
is the funny thing,

42:54.442 --> 42:58.079
turns out I don't really
like that guy very much.

42:58.697 --> 43:00.790
I mean, I don't like
me when I'm him.

43:05.412 --> 43:07.557
A year ago, I didn't have
anyone to think about

43:07.581 --> 43:08.965
except for myself.

43:10.417 --> 43:11.519
Nothing to tie me down.

43:11.543 --> 43:14.095
I could just pick up, take
off whenever I wanted.

43:15.005 --> 43:18.224
No one needed me, I
mean, really needed me.

43:18.967 --> 43:21.644
And I used to think that made me
the luckiest guy in the world.

43:22.095 --> 43:23.313
You know?

43:25.307 --> 43:26.774
And now?

43:29.102 --> 43:30.445
Now...

43:34.858 --> 43:36.200
So?

43:38.653 --> 43:39.913
So...

43:42.824 --> 43:44.417
Let's go home.
