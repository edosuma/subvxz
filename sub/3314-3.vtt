WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. HONEY, HONEY.

00:11.092 --> 00:12.432
HONEY, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

00:12.433 --> 00:13.933
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE COMING
BACK FROM THE HOSPITAL,

00:13.934 --> 00:15.805
TECHNICALLY WE ARE STILL
COMING BACK FROM OUR WEDDING,

00:15.806 --> 00:17.267
AND THERE ARE TRADITIONS.

00:17.268 --> 00:18.518
WHICH CAN WAIT.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.640
NO. UNH-UH. NOPE. SORRY.

00:20.641 --> 00:24.904
THIS NEW HUSBAND WILL NOW CARRY
HIS NEW WIFE OVER THE THRESHOLD.

00:24.905 --> 00:26.447
BUT I REALLY GOT TO PEE.

00:28.699 --> 00:30.110
SO I WON'T PICK YOU
UP BY THE BLADDER.

00:30.111 --> 00:31.651
HERE WE GO. READY? 1, 2, 3!

00:31.652 --> 00:32.652
OH! WHOA! OH!

00:32.653 --> 00:33.653
HERE WE GO. OKAY, READY?

00:33.654 --> 00:34.654

00:34.655 --> 00:35.825
OH! AHH!

00:35.826 --> 00:36.826
OH!

00:36.827 --> 00:37.827
YOU CALL THAT CAREFUL?

00:37.828 --> 00:39.419
PUT ME DOWN, PLEASE.

00:39.420 --> 00:42.832
NO. WE'RE DOING THIS.

00:42.833 --> 00:44.425
THERE ARE OTHER
THRESHOLDS IN THIS HOUSE.

00:46.006 --> 00:47.006
AHH!

00:47.007 --> 00:48.839
YEAH! TA-DA!

00:53.224 --> 00:54.344
WASN'T THAT ROMANTIC?

00:54.345 --> 00:56.387
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. I
GOT TO PEE SO BAD.

00:57.848 --> 00:58.848
IN 20 YEARS, YOU'RE GOING TO BE

00:58.849 --> 00:59.939
VERY HAPPY THAT I JUST DID THAT.

00:59.940 --> 01:00.940
NO, I WON'T.

01:00.941 --> 01:02.442

01:33.264 --> 01:34.424
FOR HELPING THE CRIPPLED BRIDE!

01:34.425 --> 01:37.017
OH, I LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH.

01:40.431 --> 01:41.892
WHERE'S MY COFFEE?

01:43.023 --> 01:45.226
OH, DAMN.

01:48.028 --> 01:49.399
HEY, LOOK AT YOU GETTING
AROUND LIKE A PRO.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.231
I TRIED TO SCRATCH MY KNEE

01:51.232 --> 01:53.993
AND I GOT A FORK
STUCK DOWN THERE.

01:53.994 --> 01:55.195
I GUESS THAT MEANS YOU'RE DONE.

01:55.196 --> 01:56.367
OH!

01:58.909 --> 02:00.039
WELL, GET READY TO LOVE ME,

02:00.040 --> 02:01.040
BECAUSE I JUST GOT US

02:01.041 --> 02:02.622
A FULL REFUND FOR OUR HONEYMOON.

02:02.623 --> 02:03.833
THAT'S RIGHT, BABY. YEAH.

02:03.834 --> 02:05.835
HOTEL, AIRFARE... THE
WORKS, ALL RIGHT?

02:05.836 --> 02:06.916
AND IF I RECALL,

02:06.917 --> 02:08.298
A CERTAIN PERSON
HERE IN THE KITCHEN

02:08.299 --> 02:10.009
LAUGHED AT ME FOR
BUYING TRIP INSURANCE.

02:10.010 --> 02:11.961
SO A LATTE A DAY.

02:11.962 --> 02:14.133
YAY FOR US. WE'RE NOT
GOING TO TAHITI.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.425
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:15.426 --> 02:17.217
LET'S TAKE A PICTURE IN
FRONT OF THE REFUND CHECK

02:17.218 --> 02:19.889
POST IT, AND MAKE ALL
OF OUR FRIENDS JEALOUS.

02:19.890 --> 02:22.432
I KNOW YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED WE
CAN'T GO ON THE HONEYMOON,

02:22.433 --> 02:23.433
BUT I PROMISE YOU,

02:23.434 --> 02:24.814
WHEN YOU'RE UP AND
RUNNING AT 100%,

02:24.815 --> 02:26.816
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU ON
THAT HONEYMOON, OKAY?

02:26.817 --> 02:28.228
ALONG WITH ALL THE
EXCITING THINGS

02:28.229 --> 02:30.480
THAT HAPPEN ON A HONEYMOON.

02:30.481 --> 02:33.443
OH, I'M NOT WAITING ANOTHER
FOUR WEEKS FOR THAT.

02:33.444 --> 02:34.824
I WANT IT NOW.

02:34.825 --> 02:35.776
THIS MARRIAGE NEEDS

02:35.777 --> 02:36.946
TO BE CONSUMMATED.

02:36.947 --> 02:38.198
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.

02:38.199 --> 02:39.829
NO. THIS IS NOT TAHITI.

02:39.830 --> 02:42.622
THIS IS HARDLY A
ROMANTIC SETTING.

02:42.623 --> 02:44.454
WELL, LET'S CHANGE
ALL THAT, SEXY MAMA.

02:44.455 --> 02:47.417
COME ON. OOH. DO YOU FEEL THAT?

02:47.418 --> 02:48.548
DO YOU FEEL THAT WARM,

02:48.549 --> 02:50.090
TROPICAL, ROMANTIC BREEZE?

02:53.554 --> 02:55.004
BRING IT IN. COME ON.

02:55.005 --> 02:56.426
( alarm beeping )

02:56.427 --> 02:58.798
IS THAT THE SMOKE ALARM?
WHAT IS IT?

02:58.799 --> 03:00.099
THAT WOULD BE THE TOASTER.

03:00.100 --> 03:01.971
SEE, AND THAT'S WHAT
HAPPENS TO A TOASTER

03:01.972 --> 03:04.013
WHEN SOMEBODY DOESN'T TAKE THE
CRUMBS OUT OF THE BOTTOM OF IT.

03:04.014 --> 03:06.015
OH, WOW. THAT WAS SO HOT.

03:06.016 --> 03:07.977
LECTURE ME AGAIN, BAD BOY.

03:07.978 --> 03:09.229
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT. FINE.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.900
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.
IT'S JUST A TOASTER.

03:10.901 --> 03:12.652
THERE ARE WAY MORE
IMPORTANT THINGS,

03:12.653 --> 03:15.405
LIKE, UM, YOU KNOW, HOW
WELL YOU'RE DOING,

03:15.406 --> 03:16.986
BECAUSE YOU HAVE HAD
ONE HECK OF A WEEK.

03:16.987 --> 03:18.818
I MEAN, DREAM WEDDING
INTERRUPTED,

03:18.819 --> 03:20.410
MY DAUGHTER MOVING IN WITH US.

03:20.411 --> 03:21.621
YOU FALLING OFF THE ROOF.

03:21.622 --> 03:23.122
US HAVING TO GET
MARRIED IN A HOSPITAL.

03:23.123 --> 03:24.454
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THROUGH IT ALL, SWEETIE,

03:24.455 --> 03:26.035
SOMEHOW YOU MANAGED TO
MAINTAIN YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR.

03:26.036 --> 03:28.918
AND I LOOK FABULOUS.

03:28.919 --> 03:30.250
YEAH, THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING.

03:30.251 --> 03:33.793
I MEAN... THAT'S WHY
I DIDN'T SAY IT.

03:33.794 --> 03:35.835
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE
NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW?

03:35.836 --> 03:37.467
WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

03:37.468 --> 03:39.640
COME ON. BRING IT IN.

03:40.801 --> 03:43.222
JOE! JOE! THE
TOILET'S OVERFLOWING!

03:43.223 --> 03:45.935
ALL I DID WAS FLUSH IT.
NOT MY FAULT.

03:45.936 --> 03:47.727
DID YOU JIGGLE THE
HANDLE FIRST, HONEY?

03:47.728 --> 03:48.728
YOU GOT TO JIGGLE
THE HANDLE FIRST.

03:48.729 --> 03:49.849
HEY, I'M NEW HERE.

03:49.850 --> 03:50.811
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOUR TOILETS WORK.

03:50.812 --> 03:52.442
DANI, YOU GOT TO
JIGGLE THE HANDLE!

03:52.443 --> 03:54.944
I TOLD YOU THAT STUFF'S
GOING TO GET EVERYWHERE!

03:54.945 --> 03:55.906
I'LL GET THE PLUNGER!

03:55.907 --> 03:58.859
IT'S THE HONEYMOON I
ALWAYS DREAMED OF.

03:59.780 --> 04:01.412
OH, THE FREAKING FORK!

04:03.784 --> 04:06.205
NICE VIEW OF THE HILLS.

04:06.206 --> 04:07.957
SHH! SOMEONE MIGHT HEAR.

04:07.958 --> 04:09.789
OKAY, BUT WE'RE A COUPLE NOW.

04:09.790 --> 04:12.332
THAT'S CUTE COUPLE BANTER.

04:12.333 --> 04:14.834
LOOK, WHATEVER WE ARE,
NO ONE NEEDS TO KNOW.

04:14.835 --> 04:15.835
COME ON! LET'S TELL THEM!

04:15.836 --> 04:17.797
MARCO, WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS.

04:17.798 --> 04:20.800
IF YOUR UNCLE JOE FINDS
OUT, HE WILL KILL YOU.

04:20.801 --> 04:22.011
AND IF WE TELL MY AUNT MEL,

04:22.012 --> 04:24.594
SHE'LL TELL JOE, AND
HE WILL KILL YOU.

04:24.595 --> 04:25.805
NAH. HE WON'T.

04:25.806 --> 04:26.806
HE WAS TELLING ME THIS MORNING

04:26.807 --> 04:28.308
HOW GLAD HE IS TO
HAVE ME AROUND.

04:28.309 --> 04:30.229
BECAUSE HE THINKS YOU
STAYED IN TOWN TO HELP OUT,

04:30.230 --> 04:31.651
BUY GROCERIES.

04:31.652 --> 04:33.022
HE THINKS ALL YOU'RE
DOING IS ERRANDS,

04:33.023 --> 04:36.816
NOT, YOU KNOW, ME.

04:36.817 --> 04:40.610
AND HAVE I BEEN HELPFUL
WITH THE GROCERIES?

04:40.611 --> 04:42.612
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

04:42.613 --> 04:43.823
YES, I DO.

04:43.824 --> 04:46.786
AND RESTOCKING SHELVES
THIS MORNING,

04:46.787 --> 04:49.248
DID YOU LIKE THAT?

04:49.249 --> 04:51.411
OKAY, STOP IT.

04:51.412 --> 04:53.673
IT'S JUST TOO RISKY
TO LET PEOPLE KNOW.

04:53.674 --> 04:55.625
WHAT'S TOO RISKY?

04:55.626 --> 04:56.966
WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?

04:56.967 --> 04:59.419
A ONE-NIGHT STAND
BETWEEN JOE AND MY MOM.

04:59.420 --> 05:00.421
BUT YOU KNOW THAT.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.013
NOW, TELL ME WHAT'S TOO RISKY.

05:04.014 --> 05:05.845
OKAY, NO ONE KNOWS THIS YET,

05:05.846 --> 05:08.519
- BUT LENNOX AND I...
- HAVE PSORIASIS.

05:10.140 --> 05:11.811
- REALLY?
- YES.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.233
OH. ITCHY, ITCHY PSORIASIS.

05:14.234 --> 05:16.025
AND WE'RE JUST NOT COMFORTABLE

05:16.026 --> 05:18.197
TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT IT.

05:18.198 --> 05:20.780
- RIGHT, MARCO?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

05:20.781 --> 05:24.615
WE SCRATCH EACH OTHER SECRETLY.

05:26.657 --> 05:28.748
OKAY, JUST PUT THE
GROCERIES AWAY.

05:28.749 --> 05:29.999
WHY DON'T WE BOTH PUT THEM AWAY?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.912
THEN WE CAN GO BACK TO
SCRATCHING EACH OTHER.

05:32.913 --> 05:34.794
I DON'T ITCH RIGHT NOW.

05:34.795 --> 05:38.007
MAYBE WE CAN PUT AWAY A
COUPLE CANS OF SOUP,

05:38.008 --> 05:39.299
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

05:42.222 --> 05:43.843
AUNT MEL, I NEED TO TALK.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.845
- I'VE GOT A PROBLEM.
- OH, ME TOO.

05:45.846 --> 05:46.847
PAINT MY TOES.

05:48.429 --> 05:51.020
OKAY, IT'S ABOUT A RELATIONSHIP,
AND IT'S COMPLICATED.

05:51.021 --> 05:53.022
OH! YOU'RE GETTING BACK
TOGETHER WITH ZANDER!

05:53.023 --> 05:54.644
SO THAT THING AT THE WEDDING
WAS JUST A LITTLE TIFF?

05:54.645 --> 05:56.646
- I KNEW IT.
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

05:56.647 --> 05:58.237
ZANDER AND I ARE OVER FOREVER.

05:58.238 --> 05:59.899
AS IT SHOULD BE.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.401
I MEAN, WE WERE BARELY BROKEN UP

06:01.402 --> 06:03.192
AND HE GOES OFF AND SLEEPS
WITH ONE OF HIS ROOMMATES.

06:03.193 --> 06:05.194
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I
CAN DO THE SAME THING.

06:05.195 --> 06:07.617
- SO I DID.
- OOH, REBOUND FLING?

06:07.618 --> 06:08.698
THOSE CAN BE SO HOT.

06:08.699 --> 06:09.789
OH, YEAH.

06:09.790 --> 06:10.790
OH, I BET I KNOW WHO IT IS.

06:10.791 --> 06:12.121
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.413
I BET IT'S THAT NORWEGIAN
EXCHANGE STUDENT

06:13.414 --> 06:14.834
WHO DROVE YOU HOME LAST WEEK.

06:14.835 --> 06:15.995
TORBETT, RIGHT?

06:15.996 --> 06:18.207
YES, TORBETT,

06:18.208 --> 06:20.671
WITH HIS SPICY NORWEGIAN BLOOD.

06:21.802 --> 06:23.423
BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM.

06:23.424 --> 06:24.844
TORBETT WANTS TO
BE MY BOYFRIEND,

06:24.845 --> 06:26.926
OUT IN THE OPEN, FULL-TIME.

06:26.927 --> 06:28.558
AND YOU DON'T THINK HE'S
BOYFRIEND MATERIAL?

06:28.559 --> 06:30.009
HE'S NOT.

06:30.010 --> 06:32.432
WE'RE JUST TOO... DIFFERENT.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.774
BUT HOW DO YOU TELL A GUY
THAT WITHOUT HURTING HIM?

06:34.775 --> 06:37.016
YOU JUST GOT TO BE
HONEST WITH HIM.

06:37.017 --> 06:38.858
I WANT TO, BUT THEN HE
TAKES HIS SHIRT OFF,

06:38.859 --> 06:40.820
AND I FORGET WHAT
I'M GOING TO SAY.

06:40.821 --> 06:43.282
YEAH, I AM FAMILIAR
WITH SIX-PACK AMNESIA.

06:43.283 --> 06:44.984
BOTH KINDS.

06:44.985 --> 06:47.196
BUT, YOU KNOW, IN MY
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE,

06:47.197 --> 06:50.409
I HAVE LEARNED THAT MEN
HAVE FEELINGS, TOO,

06:50.410 --> 06:51.701
AND YOU CAN'T LEAD THEM ON.

06:51.702 --> 06:52.992
SO BREAK UP WITH HIM?

06:52.993 --> 06:54.494
- YES.
- IS THAT WHAT YOU WOULD DO?

06:54.495 --> 06:56.415
NO.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.798
AND THAT'S HOW I KNOW
IT'S THE RIGHT THING.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.003
- HEY!
- HEY.

07:04.004 --> 07:05.845
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU
WERE OUT BY YOURSELF?

07:05.846 --> 07:07.096
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
UPSTAIRS RESTING.

07:07.097 --> 07:09.218
NOPE. I WAS ON A
MISSION OF LOVE.

07:09.219 --> 07:10.680
I UBER'ED TO THE DOCTOR,

07:10.681 --> 07:13.222
AND GOT MYSELF THIS LITTLE MINI!

07:13.223 --> 07:15.855
WELL, LOOK AT THAT.
IT'S FUN-SIZED.

07:15.856 --> 07:16.856
YEAH!

07:16.857 --> 07:18.017
FUN IS RIGHT,

07:18.018 --> 07:21.561
BECAUSE NOW EVERYTHING IS
MORE, MMM, ACCESSIBLE.

07:21.562 --> 07:22.862
THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY HELPFUL.

07:22.863 --> 07:24.774
LISTEN, I KNOW HOW
DISAPPOINTED YOU'VE BEEN

07:24.775 --> 07:25.985
ABOUT THE HONEYMOON, OKAY?

07:25.986 --> 07:28.778
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW ALL
THAT HAS NOW BEEN FIXED,

07:28.779 --> 07:30.620
BY ME, FOR YOU...

07:30.621 --> 07:32.411
MRS. LONGO.

07:32.412 --> 07:34.704
WHOA. WHO SAID I'M MRS. LONGO?

07:34.705 --> 07:37.577
MRS. MEL MY NEW WIFE.

07:37.578 --> 07:40.419
YOU ARE GETTING THAT
ROMANTIC GETAWAY AFTER ALL.

07:40.420 --> 07:43.212
I FOUND US AN INCREDIBLE
LAST-MINUTE HONEYMOON DEAL.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.343
WHERE?

07:44.344 --> 07:46.425
INCREDIBLE-LAST-MINUTE
HONEYMOON-DEALS-DOT.COM.

07:46.426 --> 07:48.848
"SECLUDED CABINS, FIREPLACES,

07:48.849 --> 07:50.349
"PANORAMIC VIEWS OF LAKE EERIE."

07:50.350 --> 07:51.681
JOE, IT LOOKS SO PRETTY,

07:51.682 --> 07:54.093
BUT CAN WE REALLY JUST UP
AND GO AWAY RIGHT NOW?

07:54.094 --> 07:55.645
YES, WE CAN.

07:55.646 --> 07:56.806
LOOK, RYDER'S GOING TO BE AT
HIS FRIEND'S HOUSE ALL WEEK

07:56.807 --> 07:58.437
'CAUSE HE THOUGHT WE WERE
GOING TO BE IN TAHITI.

07:58.438 --> 08:02.021
OKAY, NEVER SAY TAHITI UNLESS
WE ARE STANDING ON IT.

08:02.022 --> 08:04.403
MY POINT IS, HE'S TAKEN CARE OF.

08:04.404 --> 08:06.606
WELL, WHAT ABOUT DANI? SHE'S
BRAND NEW IN THE HOUSE.

08:06.607 --> 08:08.659
SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
HOW WE USE OUR TOILETS.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.410
SHE'S GOT A LITTLE BIT
OF A TROUBLED PAST.

08:11.411 --> 08:13.242
ARE YOU SURE WE CAN LEAVE
HER HERE UNSUPERVISED?

08:13.243 --> 08:14.874
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE LEAVING
HER HERE UNSUPERVISED

08:14.875 --> 08:15.875
BECAUSE...

08:15.876 --> 08:17.416
REMEMBER WHEN I HAD
THAT SECURITY COMPANY

08:17.417 --> 08:19.118
COME OVER HERE AND
INSTALL THOSE CAMERAS?

08:19.119 --> 08:21.000
I FINALLY DOWNLOADED THE
APP UP ON MY PHONE,

08:21.001 --> 08:22.622
SO NOW WE CAN CHECK IN
AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON

08:22.623 --> 08:23.793
IN THIS HOUSE WHENEVER WE WANT.

08:23.794 --> 08:25.424
WATCH THIS. THERE WE GO.

08:25.425 --> 08:27.426
HI. HEY. HEY, EVERYBODY.

08:27.427 --> 08:29.428
HI. IT'S US.

08:29.429 --> 08:30.930
HEY, DID YOU PUT ONE OF
THESE IN OUR BEDROOM?

08:30.931 --> 08:32.842
- NO.
- COULD YOU?

08:32.843 --> 08:34.134
ALREADY DID, BABY.

08:35.395 --> 08:36.636
YEAH!

08:36.637 --> 08:38.638
SO NOT ONLY DO WE
HAVE THE CAMERAS,

08:38.639 --> 08:40.229
BUT SHE'S ALSO GOING TO
HAVE TWO CHAPERONES HERE.

08:40.230 --> 08:42.021
SHE'S GOT, FOR THE BRAWN, MARCO,

08:42.022 --> 08:43.402
AND FOR THE BRAINS,

08:43.403 --> 08:44.774
THE MOST RESPONSIBLE
GIRL IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

08:44.775 --> 08:45.946
LENNOX!

08:47.778 --> 08:50.990
- LENNOX!
- WHAT? WHAT?

08:50.991 --> 08:51.991
Joey: COULD YOU COME
DOWN HERE FOR A SECOND?

08:51.992 --> 08:53.322
WE NEED TO TALK!

08:53.323 --> 08:55.616
TELL HIM YOU'RE BUSY.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.869
NO. PUT YOUR SHIRT ON.

08:59.870 --> 09:01.210
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

09:01.211 --> 09:03.423
YOU... THAT SHIRT NEVER
COMES OFF AGAIN.

09:06.627 --> 09:08.838
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS ARE IN
CHARGE UNTIL WE GET BACK.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.970
THIS SHOULD BE ENOUGH
TO COVER ALL THE MEALS.

09:10.971 --> 09:12.802
AUNT MEL, THE ONLY PEOPLE
WHO USE CASH ANYMORE

09:12.803 --> 09:15.434
ARE DRUG DEALERS AND
THE TOOTH FAIRY.

09:15.435 --> 09:17.847
WHAT KIND OF KID
TURNS DOWN MONEY?

09:17.848 --> 09:20.439
OH, I'M TAKING IT. I'M JUST
BEING SNARKY ABOUT IT.

09:20.440 --> 09:22.982
MARCO, MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL.

09:22.983 --> 09:25.445
THERE IS NO OTHER
REASON I'M HERE.

09:26.987 --> 09:27.987
SO, DANI, LISTEN, HONEY.

09:27.988 --> 09:29.989
I LEFT THE NUMBER TO
THE INN ON THE FRIDGE.

09:29.990 --> 09:32.111
WHY WOULDN'T I JUST
CALL YOUR CELL PHONE?

09:32.112 --> 09:33.823
WELL, IN CASE THERE'S
A METEOR SHOWER

09:33.824 --> 09:35.324
AND IT KNOCKS OUT ALL THE
CELLULAR TRANSMISSION.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.616
OH, WELL, THEN WE'LL BE OKAY

09:36.617 --> 09:38.959
WITH OUR $40 CASH UNTIL
THE ZOMBIES ATTACK.

09:40.410 --> 09:42.461
I LEFT MY PAINKILLERS UPSTAIRS.

09:42.462 --> 09:43.623
OH, I'LL GET THEM FOR YOU.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.164
OH, THANKS, SWEETHEART.

09:45.165 --> 09:48.207
OH, AND I COUNTED THEM!

09:48.208 --> 09:49.799
SO DID YOU BREAK UP
WITH TORBETT YET?

09:49.800 --> 09:51.010
OH, I TRIED,

09:51.011 --> 09:52.632
- BUT HE TOOK HIS SHIRT OFF.
- YES.

09:52.633 --> 09:56.595
AND FOR EVERY AB, MY I.Q.
DROPPED 10 POINTS.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.429
- HE MUST BE REALLY CUTE.
- SO CUTE!

10:01.812 --> 10:04.103
- WHO'S CUTE?
- OH, YOU ARE, HONEY.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.985
I KNOW THAT. WHAT WERE
YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT?

10:05.986 --> 10:08.187
OH, SHE'S SEEING
THIS BOY AT SCHOOL.

10:08.188 --> 10:09.819
A NORWEGIAN NAMED TORBETT.

10:09.820 --> 10:10.820
APPARENTLY HE'S REALLY HOT,

10:10.821 --> 10:12.401
BUT NOT RIGHT FOR THE LONG TERM.

10:12.402 --> 10:14.193
I MISS WHEN I WAS RUNNING AROUND

10:14.194 --> 10:15.996
WITH SCANDINAVIAN STRANGE.

10:18.789 --> 10:20.119
REALLY?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.580
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY
TO YOUR NEW HUSBAND

10:21.581 --> 10:23.202
RIGHT BEFORE WE'RE ABOUT
TO LEAVE ON OUR HONEYMOON?

10:23.203 --> 10:25.005
I NEED THE KEYS, UNCLE JOE.

10:27.207 --> 10:28.838
I'M JUST GLAD SHE'S NOT
GOING OUT WITH THAT ONE.

10:28.839 --> 10:30.089
WHY? WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR NEPHEW?

10:30.090 --> 10:31.420
WOMEN ARE SO BLIND.

10:31.421 --> 10:32.631
COME ON, HONEY. HE'S A PLAYER.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.632
WHAT? HE SEEMS SO SWEET?

10:33.633 --> 10:34.924
LIKE ALL GOOD PLAYERS DO.

10:34.925 --> 10:37.847
OH, YEAH? YOU SAY THAT LIKE
YOU'RE THE MAYOR OF PLAYERTOWN.

10:37.848 --> 10:40.519
UH-HUH. I SERVED FOR TWO TERMS.

10:40.520 --> 10:41.851
LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRAG

10:41.852 --> 10:42.852
JUT BECAUSE I HAD
A COLORFUL PAST.

10:42.853 --> 10:44.764
I'M NOT. I'M JUST TELLING YOU

10:44.765 --> 10:46.976
THAT WHEN YOU WERE OUT HAVING YOUR
INAPPROPRIATE NORDIC BOYFRIENDS,

10:46.977 --> 10:49.608
I WAS, UH... WELL,
HOW CAN I PUT THIS?

10:49.609 --> 10:50.770
LET ME SEE. OKAY.

10:50.771 --> 10:53.823
- I WAS UP TO HERE IN...
- THANKS. I GOT IT.

10:53.824 --> 10:55.985
LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING IS
IF A HOUND LIKE THAT

10:55.986 --> 10:57.907
EVER SO MUCH AS LAID A HAND
ON MY PRECIOUS LENNOX,

10:57.908 --> 11:00.159
I SWEAR... THERE HE IS!

11:00.160 --> 11:02.121
HEY! MY FAVORITE NEPHEW.

11:02.122 --> 11:03.833
MARCO, I GOT TO TELL YOU, MAN,

11:03.834 --> 11:04.994
IT'S BEEN REALLY GREAT
HAVING YOU AROUND.

11:04.995 --> 11:07.837
HEY, WITH MY NEW
AUNT RECUPERATING

11:07.838 --> 11:09.999
AND MY NEW COUSIN NEEDING
A LITTLE GUIDANCE,

11:10.000 --> 11:12.211
I'M GLAD TO STICK AROUND AS
LONG AS I CAN BE USEFUL.

11:12.212 --> 11:13.843
IT'S WHAT FAMILY DOES.

11:13.844 --> 11:16.846
YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK YOU'RE
FINALLY STARTING TO GROW UP, MAN.

11:16.847 --> 11:17.847
GET IN HERE. COME ON.

11:17.848 --> 11:18.848
HEY, HEY! HO! HO!

11:18.849 --> 11:19.850
HEY!

11:21.431 --> 11:23.062
- YOU STILL GOT IT.
- DON'T EVER FORGET IT.

11:23.063 --> 11:24.805
LENNOX, WE'RE LEAVING!

11:26.016 --> 11:27.436
SO LISTEN, DANI.

11:27.437 --> 11:28.768
YOU GOT TO LISTEN TO MARCO AND
LENNOX FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.

11:28.769 --> 11:30.189
HEY, I'LL BE FINE.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.811
I ONCE STAYED A WEEK BY MYSELF

11:31.812 --> 11:33.272
WHEN MY MOM TOOK OFF
WITH BRETT MICHAELS.

11:33.273 --> 11:36.776
BRETT MICHAELS? YUM!

11:36.777 --> 11:39.698
REALLY? BRETT MICHAELS?

11:39.699 --> 11:43.453
OH, I THOUGHT SHE SAID
CINNAMON ROLLS. YUM!

11:46.206 --> 11:48.417
I GOT TO SAY, I'M
A LITTLE BUMMED

11:48.418 --> 11:50.209
THAT I JUST GOT HERE AND YOU
GUYS ARE ALREADY GOING AWAY.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.381
SWEETHEART, WE'LL BE
BACK BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

11:52.382 --> 11:53.382
BYE.

11:53.383 --> 11:54.383
Joey: BE GOOD. LISTEN TO THEM.

11:54.384 --> 11:55.795
- I LOVE YOU, GUYS.
- HEY, KEYS!

11:55.796 --> 11:57.006
OH!

11:57.007 --> 11:58.007
BYE.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.639
I'M REALLY GOING TO MISS YOU!

12:01.431 --> 12:04.934
ALL RIGHT. PARTY TIME!

12:04.935 --> 12:07.016
OH, YEAH. IT'S A
HOMEWORK PARTY UPSTAIRS,

12:07.017 --> 12:08.307
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE INVITED.

12:08.308 --> 12:10.189
OH, COME ON, I'M NEW
AT THAT SCHOOL.

12:10.190 --> 12:11.190
I STILL GOT TWO MORE WEEKS

12:11.191 --> 12:12.731
BEFORE THEY KNOW I
CAN SPEAK ENGLISH.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.613
HOMEWORK, NOW.

12:14.614 --> 12:15.614
- BUT I DON'T NEED...
- NO.

12:15.615 --> 12:16.615
- CAN I JUST...
- NO.

12:16.616 --> 12:17.988
- MAYBE IF I...
- NO.

12:22.202 --> 12:24.414
- NOW THAT SHE'S GONE...
- NO.

12:28.418 --> 12:29.458
MARCO...

12:29.459 --> 12:33.502
LENNOX.

12:33.503 --> 12:36.085
WE NEED TO TALK.

12:36.086 --> 12:38.838
AS YOU AND I STRUGGLE TO DEFINE

12:38.839 --> 12:40.429
WHAT WE ARE TO EACH OTHER,

12:40.430 --> 12:42.431
I BELIEVE WHAT I AM TO YOU

12:42.432 --> 12:46.185
IS NEITHER... ANALOGOUS
NOR PARALLEL...

12:46.186 --> 12:48.477
YOU'RE CUTE WHEN YOU'RE THINKY.

12:48.478 --> 12:50.940
YOU NEED TO BE SERIOUS.

12:50.941 --> 12:55.395
NO. WHAT I NEED IS KETCHUP.

12:57.818 --> 13:01.030
OH! THIS IS ONE OF
MY GOOD SHIRTS.

13:01.031 --> 13:03.363
NO, DON'T!

13:07.207 --> 13:11.620
BEST GROCERY RUN YET.

13:11.621 --> 13:14.623
YEAH.

13:14.624 --> 13:16.836
BUT, UM...

13:16.837 --> 13:18.919
I'M AFRAID THAT WAS
THE LAST TIME.

13:20.220 --> 13:21.341
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:24.014 --> 13:25.805
I DON'T REALLY WANT A
BOYFRIEND RIGHT NOW...

13:28.849 --> 13:30.809
AND I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU THAT BEFORE.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.602
MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE.

13:33.603 --> 13:37.897
IT'S JUST... YOU'RE
SO DAMN IRRESISTIBLE.

13:37.898 --> 13:40.609
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TAKE THAT.

13:40.610 --> 13:43.402
A COMPLIMENT WRAPPED
AROUND A PUT-DOWN.

13:43.403 --> 13:45.495
IT'S LIKE AN INSULT CALZONE.

13:47.787 --> 13:50.749
WHOA HO! I THINK I CAN
HANDLE THREE DAYS OF THIS.

13:50.750 --> 13:51.911
HUH? THIS IS AWESOME!

13:51.912 --> 13:53.622
LOOK AT THAT. WE GOT A
LAKE VIEW OVER HERE.

13:53.623 --> 13:56.005
WE GOT, UH...

13:56.006 --> 13:57.216
A VIEW OF THE
MOUNTAINS OVER THERE.

13:57.217 --> 14:00.379
BUT THE BEST VIEW OF ALL,

14:00.380 --> 14:01.961
THAT WOULD BE RIGHT
HERE IN FRONT OF ME.

14:01.962 --> 14:04.633
AWW, JOE, I FULLY INTEND
TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU.

14:04.634 --> 14:06.555
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORK SO HARD.

14:06.556 --> 14:08.847
NO, I DO IT FOR ME.

14:08.848 --> 14:09.848
I DO LIKE THIS ROOM.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.892
YEAH, WELL, NOTHING BUT
THE BEST FOR MRS. LONG...

14:12.893 --> 14:15.394
TERM PARTNER FOREVER.

14:15.395 --> 14:17.106
MM-HMM.

14:17.107 --> 14:19.478
LET'S TAKE THIS
NICE AND SLOW, HUH?

14:19.479 --> 14:21.690
SCREW THAT. IT'S
CONSUMMATING TIME.

14:21.691 --> 14:22.691
OH, OKAY. I'M DOWN.

14:22.692 --> 14:24.193
YEAH, SURE. LET'S DO IT,.

14:24.194 --> 14:27.196
HO! I LIKE THAT. I LIKE THAT.
YEAH!

14:27.197 --> 14:28.988
YOU KNOW WHAT? I JUST
THOUGHT ABOUT SOMETHING.

14:28.989 --> 14:30.409
THIS IS GOING TO
BE THE FIRST TIME

14:30.410 --> 14:33.872
THAT YOU HAVE EVER HAD
SEX WITH A MARRIED GUY.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.625
ABSOLUTELY.

14:36.626 --> 14:39.459
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE EVER DONE THAT.

14:42.802 --> 14:45.134
OOH! IS THIS MARRIED MAN SEX?

14:45.135 --> 14:46.215
SAUCY.

14:46.216 --> 14:48.807
NO, YOU HAD A MOSQUITO ON YOUR BUTT.
LOOK.

14:48.808 --> 14:49.808
- HMM.
- ( buzzing )

14:49.809 --> 14:51.850
OOH! ONE ON YOU, TOO.

14:51.851 --> 14:53.812
WHAT THE... WHAT THE...

14:53.813 --> 14:54.893
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE!

14:54.894 --> 14:56.225
YOU LEFT THE WINDOW OPEN!

14:56.226 --> 14:57.816
I WAS TRYING TO GET
SOME FRESH AIR IN HERE!

14:57.817 --> 14:59.979
YOU GOT TO AT LEAST
CLOSE THE SCREEN!

14:59.980 --> 15:02.942
OH, GREAT. YOU'RE LOCKING
THEM IN HERE WITH US NOW!

15:02.943 --> 15:04.113
YOU'RE THE MAN.
START KILLING THEM.

15:04.114 --> 15:06.735
WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M DOING?
GIVING THEM HIGH-FIVES?

15:06.736 --> 15:08.787
YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE
THIS WILL STOP THEM.

15:08.788 --> 15:10.739
WHAT? HONEY, THAT'S SUNSCREEN.

15:10.740 --> 15:12.161
YEAH, MAYBE IT WILL WORK.

15:12.162 --> 15:14.994
OH, NICE. WELL, AT LEAST
THEY WON'T GET SKIN CANCER.

15:14.995 --> 15:16.205
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU...

15:16.206 --> 15:18.208
( both scream )

15:23.843 --> 15:25.424
BUT WE'RE SO GOOD TOGETHER.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.006
MARCO, I DIDN'T PLAN
IT THIS WAY, OKAY?

15:27.007 --> 15:29.008
I'M JUST TRYING TO
BE HONEST WITH YOU.

15:29.009 --> 15:31.010
YOU AND I HAVE NO FUTURE AS
BOYFRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND,

15:31.011 --> 15:32.391
AND THE SOONER WE
BOTH ACCEPT THAT...

15:32.392 --> 15:34.353
I JUST FEEL... USED.

15:34.354 --> 15:35.814
THERE YOU GUYS ARE.

15:35.815 --> 15:37.606
I WAS YELLING UPSTAIRS
AND NOBODY ANSWERED.

15:37.607 --> 15:39.979
WHAT WERE YOU GUYS DOING?

15:39.980 --> 15:42.481
- GROCERIES.
- SCRATCHING.

15:42.482 --> 15:45.614
INTERESTING.

15:45.615 --> 15:47.776
ANYWAY, WHAT I WAS YELLING
ABOUT WAS DINNER.

15:47.777 --> 15:49.408
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THAT?

15:49.409 --> 15:52.411
UM... OH, I THINK WE
HAVE LEFTOVER PIZZA.

15:52.412 --> 15:53.742
WE DO. WE DO.

15:53.743 --> 15:57.286
I WILL HEAT SOME UP AS I
AM ONLY HERE TO HELP.

15:57.287 --> 16:00.789
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET
SOME STUDYING DONE.

16:00.790 --> 16:03.632
I SHOULD PROBABLY HELP HER.

16:03.633 --> 16:05.004
I THINK YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO AVOID TALKING TO ME.

16:05.005 --> 16:06.385
AM NOT.

16:06.386 --> 16:09.388
THIS IS STUDYING?

16:09.389 --> 16:11.640
I WON'T BE ABLE TO
CONCENTRATE ON MY SCHOOLWORK

16:11.641 --> 16:14.263
UNTIL I SEE WHAT HAPPENS
ON HOOKING UP TONIGHT.

16:14.264 --> 16:16.555
WHOA. YOU'RE TOO YOUNG
TO WATCH THAT SHOW.

16:16.556 --> 16:20.809
PLEASE. I'VE TOURED WITH
MY MOM AND BLACK SABBATH.

16:20.810 --> 16:23.903
I'VE SEEN STUFF THAT WOULD
BE BLOCKED ON YOUTUBE.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.406
OKAY, THEN I'LL
WATCH IT WITH YOU.

16:27.407 --> 16:29.988
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO DISCOURAGE ME?

16:29.989 --> 16:31.531
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS SHOW.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.455
I THOUGHT SHOWS LIKE THIS
WERE ONLY ON THE COMPUTER.

16:36.456 --> 16:37.616
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT

16:37.617 --> 16:38.827
IF CHLOE'S GOING TO
STICK WITH THIS GUY

16:38.828 --> 16:40.209
SHE JUMPED ON JUST FOR FUN,

16:40.210 --> 16:42.961
BUT DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE A
REAL RELATIONSHIP WITH.

16:42.962 --> 16:46.885
THAT SOUNDS MOST INTRIGUING.

16:46.886 --> 16:49.007
- TELL ME MORE.
- OKAY.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.839
SHE HAD A FLING WITH
THIS REAL CUTE GUY,

16:50.840 --> 16:52.891
BUT DOESN'T THINK HE CAN
CUT IT AS A BOYFRIEND.

16:52.892 --> 16:55.224
MAYBE SHE SHOULD JUST
GIVE THIS GUY A CHANCE.

16:55.225 --> 16:56.265
IS HE NICE TO HER?

16:56.266 --> 16:58.187
HE'S SWEET.

16:58.188 --> 16:59.478
AND THEY HAVE CHEMISTRY.

16:59.479 --> 17:01.560
SO WHAT IS THIS GIRL'S PROBLEM?

17:01.561 --> 17:02.851
WELL, SHE THINKS...

17:02.852 --> 17:04.693
THE PROBLEM IS SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO HURT HIM.

17:04.694 --> 17:05.814
SHE'S NOT A HORRIBLE PERSON,

17:05.815 --> 17:07.406
BUT SHE JUST GOT OUT
OF A RELATIONSHIP

17:07.407 --> 17:09.409
AND SHE'S NOT READY
FOR A NEW ONE.

17:11.201 --> 17:12.282
I ASSUME.

17:13.703 --> 17:16.496
DO YOU TWO REALLY THINK
YOU'RE FOOLING ANYBODY?

17:17.747 --> 17:19.498
Melissa: HARDER. HARDER!

17:19.499 --> 17:20.829
Joey: ARE YOU SURE?

17:20.830 --> 17:22.621
- I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU.
- CAN HANDLE IT.

17:22.622 --> 17:24.213
Melissa: OH, THAT'S IT.
THAT'S THE SPOT.

17:24.214 --> 17:25.794
OH, IT'S SO GOOD.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.426
Joey: NOW IT'S MY TURN.
YOU HAVE TO DO ME.

17:27.427 --> 17:28.797
Melissa: NO, I'M
NOT FINISHED YET.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.629
Joey: COME ON. MY
HAND'S GETTING TIRED.

17:30.630 --> 17:33.132
Melissa: THEN USE THE
OTHER HAND, DAMN IT.

17:33.133 --> 17:35.844
OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH.

17:35.845 --> 17:38.347
OH! NO. NO, NO. IT'S
JUST NOT DOING IT.

17:38.348 --> 17:39.938
LOOK, YOU SEEMED
TO BE ENJOYING IT.

17:39.939 --> 17:40.770
YEAH, WELL, I GOT CLOSE.

17:40.771 --> 17:42.181
BUT I JUST...

17:42.182 --> 17:43.312
I NEED CALAMINE LOTION.

17:43.313 --> 17:44.773
YOU NEED CALAMINE... HEY!

17:44.774 --> 17:46.685
IT'S MY TURN. COME ON,
YOU HAVE TO DO MY BACK.

17:46.686 --> 17:47.687
DO YOURSELF.

17:51.611 --> 17:53.612
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S
NOT GOING TO WORK.

17:53.613 --> 17:54.614
I JUST GOT TOO MANY MUSCLES.

17:57.617 --> 17:58.997
WOW.

17:58.998 --> 18:02.622
THAT EPISODE WAS
ESPECIALLY INAPPROPRIATE.

18:05.205 --> 18:08.208
I AM NOW A FAN OF
THIS HOOKING UP SHOW.

18:09.669 --> 18:10.839
AND I GOT TO SAY,

18:10.840 --> 18:12.010
I'M GLAD TO SEE
CHLOE'S GOING TO TRY

18:12.011 --> 18:13.922
TO MAKE IT WORK WITH FLING GUY.

18:13.923 --> 18:16.635
I DON'T THINK IT'S A
SMART DECISION AT ALL.

18:16.636 --> 18:18.807
THESE CHARACTERS ARE
MAKING TERRIBLE CHOICES.

18:18.808 --> 18:19.769
AND IT'S A TV SHOW.

18:19.770 --> 18:21.810
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO
IMITATE THEIR BEHAVIOR.

18:21.811 --> 18:25.104
- EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.
- ( alarm beeping )

18:28.988 --> 18:30.359
YOU GUYS STAY BACK.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.611
DANI, GO IN THE OTHER ROOM.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.838
( alarm beeping )

18:51.801 --> 18:54.424
( snorts ) IT'S THE TOASTER.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.256
YOU BETTER BE WATCHING

18:57.257 --> 18:59.808
HOW TO PLEASE YOUR WOMAN VIDEOS.

18:59.809 --> 19:01.390
NO, WE JUST GOT A
SECURITY ALERT.

19:01.391 --> 19:03.852
OOH! YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.

19:03.853 --> 19:06.605
I'LL LET YOU PLAY
CONNECT THE DOTS LATER.

19:06.606 --> 19:07.856
SO WHAT'S THIS SECURITY ALERT?

19:07.857 --> 19:09.147
IT WAS A SMOKE ALARM.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.190
YEAH, BECAUSE SOMEBODY HERE
DIDN'T CLEAN THE CRUMBS

19:11.191 --> 19:12.901
OUT OF THE TOASTER LIKE
THEY SAID THEY DID.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.773
UH, I CLEANED IT OUT.

19:14.774 --> 19:15.774
MM-HMM. I'M SURE YOU DID.

19:15.775 --> 19:17.536
YEAH. NO, I DID. IT WASN'T ME.

19:17.537 --> 19:18.987
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

19:18.988 --> 19:22.372
WELL, IT SORT OF
SEEMS LIKE IT DOES.

19:25.995 --> 19:29.878
IT'S A MESS IN THERE, BUT
AT LEAST THE FIRE'S OUT.

19:29.879 --> 19:33.792
THAT WAS... AMAZING.

19:33.793 --> 19:36.845
YEAH. MY NONA USED TO
FALL ASLEEP SMOKING,

19:36.846 --> 19:39.639
SO I GOT PRETTY HANDY
WITH THESE BABIES.

19:41.060 --> 19:42.802
I'M JUST SO GLAD YOU WERE HERE.

19:44.394 --> 19:45.765
ME, TOO.

19:48.308 --> 19:49.978
WE'RE ALL GOOD NOW.

19:49.979 --> 19:53.772
UM, SO I GUESS I'M
JUST GOING TO GO PACK.

19:53.773 --> 19:55.774
THERE'S A BUS LATER TO NEWARK...

19:55.775 --> 19:58.157
AND THAT'LL BE THAT.

20:06.416 --> 20:08.417
WAS THAT A KISS FOR
YOUR BOYFRIEND

20:08.418 --> 20:11.830
OR A KISS JUST 'CAUSE I'M
SO DAMNED IRRESISTIBLE?

20:11.831 --> 20:13.832
BOYFRIEND.

20:13.833 --> 20:16.425
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

20:16.426 --> 20:17.636
YEAH.

20:17.637 --> 20:19.889
YOU'RE NOT THAT HARD TO RESIST.

20:26.806 --> 20:29.227
I TOLD YOU IT WASN'T ME.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.401
IN MY OWN HOUSE.

20:32.402 --> 20:35.193
YOU KNOW, IT'S A GOOD THING
POOR TORBETT'S NOT SEEING...

20:35.194 --> 20:37.986
OH!

20:37.987 --> 20:39.778
I GOT TO SAY, AMAZING
SECURITY SYSTEM.

20:39.779 --> 20:41.320
LOOK, YOU CAN ZOOM IN.

20:41.321 --> 20:42.322
NO THANKS.

20:45.415 --> 20:47.826
WELL, WE CONSUMMATED,
AND IN RECORD TIME,

20:47.827 --> 20:50.419
BUT THAT DOES NOT COUNT AS
OFFICIAL HONEYMOON SEX.

20:50.420 --> 20:53.251
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
IT WASN'T SO BAD.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.253
WELL, MAYBE NEXT
TIME WE CAN DO IT

20:55.254 --> 20:56.545
WITH ALL OF OUR CLOTHES OFF.

20:56.546 --> 20:58.216
YEAH, I KNOW.

20:58.217 --> 20:59.548
I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE

20:59.549 --> 21:00.639
THIS MARCO, MAN.

21:00.640 --> 21:01.970
"HEY, UNCLE JOE.

21:01.971 --> 21:03.261
"HERE TO HELP OUT THE FAMILY."

21:03.262 --> 21:04.262
YEAH, MORE LIKE

21:04.263 --> 21:05.594
HELPING HIMSELF OUT.

21:05.595 --> 21:06.685
LOOK, I OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO GO

21:06.686 --> 21:07.936
AND DEAL WITH THIS
WHOLE SITUATION,

21:07.937 --> 21:08.977
BUT WHY DON'T YOU STAY
HERE FOR A COUPLE DAYS

21:08.978 --> 21:09.809
AND JUST ENJOY YOURSELF?

21:09.810 --> 21:11.810
YEAH, JUST HANG OUT HERE
WITH THE MOSQUITOES

21:11.811 --> 21:13.692
AND WATCH THE HOW TO
CHECK OUT CHANNEL.

21:13.693 --> 21:14.693
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

21:14.694 --> 21:16.896
OKAY, I'M GOING TO
GO GET THE CAR.

21:17.777 --> 21:18.987
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE IN THIS

21:18.988 --> 21:20.109
FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE.

21:22.992 --> 21:25.204
I'M JUST WAITING FOR
THE BETTER PART.
