But they'll
be doing it the hard way.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.965
After rappelling 131 feet

07:50.068 --> 07:53.310
and relying only
on their powers of observation,

07:53.413 --> 07:54.793
they need
to match these five names

07:54.896 --> 07:57.793
with their corresponding
family crests.

are not scared of heights,

I'm gonna look at the flags

17:18.344 --> 17:19.586
I might have to do it again.

17:19.689 --> 17:21.205
At least I know
what I'm looking at now.

17:21.310 --> 17:22.896
-Incorrect.
-Sounds good.

17:24.517 --> 17:26.172
LUMUMBA:
Sounds like that
might be the tractor.

17:26.275 --> 17:27.619
GLENDA:
That was faster than I thought.

17:27.723 --> 17:29.379
-LUMUMBA: Yeah, me, too.
-GLENDA: We may still be racing.

17:29.482 --> 17:30.517
We'll see what happens.

17:30.620 --> 17:32.103
LUMUMBA:
Right now, we are watching

17:32.206 --> 17:35.482
an amazing neighbor in this area
come through on her tractor,

17:35.586 --> 17:37.448
-like a hero on a stallion.
-[laughs]

17:37.551 --> 17:39.862
-Pretty quickly, mind you.
-And, um, it has chains.
Pretty quickly.

17:39.965 --> 17:41.620
-Literally within five minutes.
-Yeah, within five minutes.

17:41.724 --> 17:43.482
-GLENDA: Go, go, go.
-LUMUMBA: Oui, oui, oui. Oui.

17:43.586 --> 17:45.862
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

17:45.965 --> 17:48.275
-GLENDA: There was no damage
to the car. That's a miracle.
-Yeah.

17:48.379 --> 17:49.586
When the car
got back on the road,

17:49.689 --> 17:50.896
I was excited,
'cause I'm thinking,

17:51.000 --> 17:52.551
"Okay, we're
still in this race."

17:52.655 --> 17:53.758
-I want to finish strong.
-We're gonna finish strong.

17:53.862 --> 17:56.034
She came within five minutes.

-Thank God for farmer lady.

All right, we're
back in business.

What comes to your mind?

18:08.689 --> 18:10.034
[laughter]

18:11.620 --> 18:13.137
Think I got it this time.

18:14.172 --> 18:15.172
There's only five.

18:16.172 --> 18:17.344
And I know four of them.

18:17.448 --> 18:19.379
So, process of elimination

18:19.482 --> 18:20.482
should get the fifth.

18:22.172 --> 18:23.379
Correct.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.931
Yes. Thank you. Hugs.

18:28.034 --> 18:29.034
Ah!

18:29.137 --> 18:30.758
QUINTON:
Yes!

18:34.586 --> 18:35.793
[mutters]

18:35.896 --> 18:37.482
Oh, no.

18:37.586 --> 18:39.413
It's the women's names.

18:39.517 --> 18:40.965
[exhales]

18:41.068 --> 18:43.655
For whatever reason,
I only looked at the male names.

18:43.758 --> 18:45.379
And I go to judge's table,
I'm like...

18:46.413 --> 18:47.689
"These are all women's names."

18:47.793 --> 18:49.827
So then I just
gave it my best guess.

18:49.931 --> 18:51.137
All right. Probably wrong.

18:51.241 --> 18:52.931

unfortunately, you are
the last team to arrive.

41:20.310 --> 41:21.413
And I'm sorry to tell you

41:21.517 --> 41:23.068
you have been eliminated
from the race.

41:23.172 --> 41:24.068
-We know.
-We know.

41:24.172 --> 41:25.862
I do know that you ended strong.

41:25.965 --> 41:27.586
-Yeah, we did.
-You've had an adventure.

41:27.689 --> 41:29.517
-LUMUMBA: Yeah. Oh, my goodness.
-Uh, a driving adventure,

41:29.620 --> 41:31.655
-you've... you've
been in ditches,
-Yes.

41:31.758 --> 41:33.931
-over rivers, over fields.
-Oh, my God.
-Yes.

41:34.034 --> 41:36.068
I went head over heels
for this woman twice.

41:37.482 --> 41:39.172
So, did you get what you wanted
out of this?

41:39.275 --> 41:41.034
Oh, my goodness.
Yes, we did.

41:41.137 --> 41:44.172
-[laughs] Like, we are
more in love with each other.
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

41:44.275 --> 41:45.551
-Oh, yeah, definitely.
-We're more appreciative
of each other.

41:45.655 --> 41:48.344
So for us, it did
what it was supposed to do.

41:48.448 --> 41:49.620
LUMUMBA:
You know, it's not
the end of the race.

41:49.724 --> 41:51.103
It's really, you know,
the beginning,

41:51.206 --> 41:52.448
-you know, it's part of...
-Beginning of our race.

41:53.655 --> 41:56.448
GLENDA:
We're not going back
the same people that we started.

41:56.551 --> 41:57.758
I'm going back very much

41:57.862 --> 41:59.758
a better partner to my husband,

41:59.862 --> 42:01.862
-hopefully a better mom
to my future kid, so...
-Aw.

42:01.965 --> 42:03.620
LUMUMBA:
You know, we're already winning.

42:03.724 --> 42:05.034
-Exactly.
-You know,
it may not be in this race,

42:05.137 --> 42:06.586
but I feel like there's nothing

42:06.689 --> 42:08.724
-that we can't
accomplish together, so...
-Exactly.

-Let's go.

42:44.482 --> 42:45.689
Let's go!

42:47.413 --> 42:48.344
Luis gave me a thumbs up.

42:48.448 --> 42:50.344
Luis and Derek have a bromance.

42:50.448 --> 42:52.172
-He's my brochacho.
-Oh!

42:52.275 --> 42:53.206
I've never
done any masonry work.

42:53.310 --> 42:55.206
