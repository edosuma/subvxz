01:58.660 --> 02:01.830
What should I do with
this, Your Excellency?

02:01.913 --> 02:03.164
Yes.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.917
I picked it out for Daria Alexandrovna
and the children.

02:08.836 --> 02:10.005
<i>Bonjour, </i> Lili.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.715
<i>Bonjour.</i>

02:13.299 --> 02:14.467
<i>Bonjour, </i> Grisha.

02:14.551 --> 02:15.760
<i>Bonjour.</i>

02:16.344 --> 02:17.554
Vasya.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.350
Who is coming to see <i>Grand-maman?</i>

02:22.434 --> 02:23.601
Me! Me! Me!

02:27.897 --> 02:29.649
Come along, my little ducklings.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.598
Be good today. I'm off.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.270
Read the chapter carefully.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.396
I'll come back to test you on it.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.566
Read it twice.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.289
<i>Au revoir.</i>

03:42.681 --> 03:44.182
Oh, Stiva.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.083
Aunt Dolly found a note
from the governess.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.167
Well?

04:11.710 --> 04:15.255
Stiva wants me to come to Moscow
to persuade Dolly to forgive him.

04:15.296 --> 04:18.966
I'm to be deprived of my wife
so that adultery may be forgiven?

04:20.343 --> 04:22.387
I can't excuse him
just because he's your brother.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.305
Oh, it's for Dolly's sake, too.

04:24.389 --> 04:25.598
Four committees today.

04:26.683 --> 04:27.809
I have the world waiting for me.

04:27.892 --> 04:30.979
There's never time to
look at your exercises.

04:31.062 --> 04:34.441
Serozha is doing very
well, Your Excellency.

04:34.482 --> 04:36.276
Who put this shirt on you?

04:36.359 --> 04:38.611
Well, never mind. I'll
come and hear you read.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.281
Tomorrow, perhaps.

04:41.656 --> 04:44.200
Thank you, Lukich. Perhaps tomorrow.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.370
No. No, no, not tomorrow.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.747
Thank you, Your Excellency.

04:48.872 --> 04:49.956
Come along.

04:50.665 --> 04:53.543
Alexei, do you think
nine years of marriage and children

04:53.626 --> 04:56.796
should count for nothing
against an infatuation?

04:56.880 --> 04:59.382
No. Very well.

04:59.466 --> 05:02.969
But sin has a price, you
may be sure of that.

05:04.637 --> 05:05.805
But why?

05:05.847 --> 05:07.640
Because that's where Aunt Dolly lives.

05:07.682 --> 05:10.810
- But why?
- I told you, Serozha.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.812
She's not well. I must go to see her.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.356
But why, Mama?

05:14.439 --> 05:16.483
Don't make Mama cry.

05:16.524 --> 05:18.360
I'll be back before you know,
and bring you a present.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.363
I don't want a present.
I want you to stay.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.698
Oh, my little <i>Kotik.</i>

05:24.032 --> 05:25.700
What present?

05:25.784 --> 05:27.660
That's better.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.271
It's the first time I've
left my little boy.

05:55.355 --> 05:59.526
So, you're leaving your son
and I'm returning to mine.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.486
I'm Countess Vronskaya.

06:01.528 --> 06:04.864
I've been in St. Petersburg
for the christening of a granddaughter.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.700
My eldest son married Princess Chirkov.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.708
You're a charming creature.
Why don't I know you?

06:15.834 --> 06:17.585
I've never been in Moscow society, really.

06:17.669 --> 06:19.045
But you know my name.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.631
- I've heard you mentioned.
- Talked about, you mean?

06:24.926 --> 06:26.386
Ah, love.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.264
- Was it love?
- Always.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.558
My sons are ashamed of me.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.269
But I'd rather end up wishing I
hadn't than end up wishing I had.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.603
Wouldn't you?

06:36.479 --> 06:37.689
I don't know.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.762
Some man came
without an appointment, Your Excellency.

07:08.845 --> 07:09.971
Waiting outside.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.183
Levin! Where did you disappear?

07:13.641 --> 07:15.310
I'm very anxious to see you.

07:16.811 --> 07:17.937
I need your advice.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.397
Well, come into my room, then.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.859
This is my oldest friend,
Konstantin Dmitrievich Levin.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.153
Someone send word I'll
be a few minutes late.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.239
That's my office, up there.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.578
Oh, I've been hard at it. Sit down.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.954
Hard at what, exactly?

07:35.038 --> 07:37.040
Well, we're overwhelmed with work.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.124
Paperwork.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.460
Paperwork is the soul of Russia.
Farming is only the stomach.

07:40.543 --> 07:43.380
Now, when am I going to
come and shoot some snipe?

07:46.508 --> 07:49.511
Look at you, in Western clothes
you told me you'd never wear again.

07:49.594 --> 07:50.637
Something's up.

07:50.679 --> 07:54.307
Yes, I'm in love. I've
come back to propose.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.310
Have you guessed who she is?

07:57.394 --> 07:59.854
I... I have a suspicion.
Why didn't you propose when you were here?

08:00.355 --> 08:02.482
I decided it was impossible.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.985
Kitty is of the heavens, an angel.
And I am of the earth.

08:06.027 --> 08:09.823
But then, I thought and thought,
and there's no life for me without her.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.826
- Do I have a chance?
- Of course you do.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.327
The Shcherbatskys
are giving a soiree this evening.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.870
Get there early, before the crowd.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.539
- And if I may suggest...
- Anything, what?

08:17.622 --> 08:19.791
- New boots.
- Right. Anything else?

08:21.501 --> 08:22.669
We'd better have dinner together.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.379
Come on. We'll meet later at l'Angleterre.

08:24.462 --> 08:25.839
Or do you prefer the Hermitage?

08:25.922 --> 08:27.716
Let's say, 5:30 at l'Angleterre.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.259
I owe them more than the Hermitage,

08:29.342 --> 08:30.802
so it wouldn't be fair
to withdraw my custom.

08:30.844 --> 08:35.515
Uh, so, new boots, coat, and a proper hat.

09:18.183 --> 09:20.268
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

09:20.352 --> 09:21.728
Do you...

09:22.020 --> 09:23.396
Do you...

09:25.690 --> 09:26.900
Excuse me.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.387
It's so unfair.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.764
You marry for love.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.641
You're a good husband.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.603
Children arrive, years depart.

10:04.437 --> 10:08.942
And all of a sudden,
your wife grows old and tired.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.611
And her hair is thin. And her body...

10:11.653 --> 10:13.822
And you yourself, you
still have your vigor!

10:15.031 --> 10:18.159
And then you find yourself
a martyr to distraction by so many women.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.161
Forgive me, but I find
that incomprehensible.

10:20.245 --> 10:23.707
As though, I should leave this restaurant
and steal a roll from a baker's shop.

10:23.790 --> 10:24.916
Well, you know, a freshly baked roll.

10:24.958 --> 10:28.920
I'm talking about love,
and you're talking about your appetite.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.631
Easily confused.
Now, do you know, um, Count Vronsky?

10:31.715 --> 10:33.299
Who? No. Why?

10:33.383 --> 10:35.385
He's your rival. He turned up
from Petersburg after you left.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.469
Who is he?

10:36.511 --> 10:39.055
Oh, you don't need to worry about him.
He's... He's just...

10:39.139 --> 10:40.807
He's a rich, good-looking cavalry officer

10:40.890 --> 10:43.518
who has nothing better to do
than make love to pretty women.

10:43.601 --> 10:44.728
Is that cabbage soup?

10:44.811 --> 10:48.023
<i>Potage aux choux Ã  la russe,</i>
as the gentleman ordered.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.983
It's what I wanted.

10:51.818 --> 10:55.113
Understand that, for me,
tonight is a question of life and death.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.531
Kostya...

10:57.157 --> 10:59.617
Kostya, Kitty would be mad to refuse you.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.828
And Dolly's on your side, you know?

11:02.495 --> 11:06.249
She says her sister Kitty was always
meant to be your wife, and will be.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.417
Dolly said that?

11:09.461 --> 11:11.254
I've always thought your Dolly was a gem.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.464
She is.

11:13.465 --> 11:14.758
She is.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.801
I loved her to distraction.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.679
Konstantin!

11:21.723 --> 11:23.224
Konstantin!

11:27.812 --> 11:29.272
Konstantin!

11:29.564 --> 11:31.524
I'm too early. I'll come back.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.693
No. Come up.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.394
Look at me.

12:07.477 --> 12:10.397
I'm receiving for <i>Papa </i> and <i>Maman,</i>
who are late to dress.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.232
It's my first reception.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.151
Princess Ekaterina.

12:16.653 --> 12:17.946
Delighted. Delighted.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.617
I'm so pleased you were able to be
with us, Konstantin Dmitrievich.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.078
Kitty, you look...

12:26.913 --> 12:29.332
- You look...
- Stiva told us you were back.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.417
How long are you staying?

12:30.458 --> 12:32.919
I don't know. It depends on you.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.005
On me?

12:36.840 --> 12:40.969
What I mean to say is I...

12:41.052 --> 12:42.679
I only came with one purpose.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.599
I want to... Will you be my wife?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.273
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.275
Wrong moment. It's the wrong moment.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.693
But will you?

12:59.237 --> 13:00.447
I can't.

13:08.246 --> 13:09.414
I'm sorry.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.624
Yes.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.294
It was impossible.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.674
I'm sorry.

13:20.383 --> 13:22.135
Are you the brother of Nikolai Levin?

13:22.177 --> 13:23.219
Yes.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.931
He's in Moscow.
He's staying at the Unicorn in Khitrovka.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.141
How do you know?

13:28.183 --> 13:30.143
It's the sort of thing I know.

13:35.774 --> 13:36.900
Count Vronsky?

13:37.275 --> 13:38.401
Yes?

13:51.831 --> 13:53.500
Princess Kitty.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.336
It's been so long,
and yet, it seems like yesterday.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.338
It was yesterday.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.491
Excuse me.

14:26.866 --> 14:27.951
No.

14:29.619 --> 14:30.704
Sorry.

15:06.656 --> 15:07.866
It's Kostya.

15:08.283 --> 15:09.909
Good God! Look at him.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.871
You look like a capitalist.

15:13.371 --> 15:14.873
What do you want?

15:14.914 --> 15:17.417
Nothing. I came to see you.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.047
Good evening, miss... Madam.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.591
Don't talk to her like that.
You sound like a magistrate.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.636
More vodka for my brother! Quick about it.

15:29.346 --> 15:30.805
I don't want anything.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.099
I'm all right.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.355
Who told you where to find me?

15:38.438 --> 15:42.317
A colonel in the Third Department.
They're watching you.

15:43.568 --> 15:44.611
Good.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.238
They must think I'm dangerous.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.241
What have you got to smile about?

15:50.283 --> 15:51.326
Nothing.

15:51.409 --> 15:52.410
That's right.

15:52.494 --> 15:56.498
The day is coming.
I have given up my birthright for it.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.584
You're on the wrong side of history.

16:00.085 --> 16:02.253
Not because privilege is immoral.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.714
But because it's irrational.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.259
He's sick!

16:08.551 --> 16:10.470
Let go, if you know what's good for you.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.473
I took Marya Nikolaevna from a brothel.

16:15.016 --> 16:16.851
But I consider her my wife.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.813
If her presence offends,
you're free to leave.

16:22.941 --> 16:24.317
Are you married?

16:26.152 --> 16:27.612
No.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.990
Why not? Are you waiting to fall in love?

16:31.032 --> 16:32.867
- No.
- Good.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.829
Romantic love will be
the last illusion of the old order.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.332
You should marry one of your peasants.

16:39.749 --> 16:42.043
Yes. I damn well should.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.922
The brotherhood of man!

16:58.685 --> 17:00.395
Nikolai, you need to see a doctor.

17:02.605 --> 17:05.066
Then come and stay with me at Pokrovskoe
till you get your health back.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.526
With my wife?

17:07.109 --> 17:08.153
If you...

17:09.237 --> 17:10.320
Or...

17:11.071 --> 17:13.324
Or go abroad to a spa.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.746
I'll send more if that's what you want.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.342
Hello, what's this?

17:30.383 --> 17:33.720
Austrian royalty on their honeymoon.
I've got them for four days.

17:34.179 --> 17:36.264
The private carriage will
stop opposite the stand.

17:36.348 --> 17:39.059
Bad luck. What do they like, art?

17:39.684 --> 17:40.685
Food.

17:41.770 --> 17:43.229
Here's the train.

17:54.115 --> 17:55.116
Oh.

18:04.709 --> 18:06.044
I'll come back.

18:15.303 --> 18:16.680
Stiva!

18:17.472 --> 18:18.515
Anna!

18:22.894 --> 18:25.397
- You don't look ashamed!
- Oh, I am, I really am.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.025
Yes, of course. Oblonsky's
sister, Karenina.

18:32.487 --> 18:33.863
<i>Charmante, </i> don't you think?

18:53.466 --> 18:54.843
There, Countess.

18:54.926 --> 18:56.928
You have found your son,
and I have found my brother.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.805
Madam Karenina has a son, too.

18:58.847 --> 19:01.016
It's the first time they've been apart,
so she frets about him.

19:01.766 --> 19:04.019
Excuse me for not recognizing you before.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.480
<i>- Au revoir, </i> Countess.<i>
- Au revoir, </i> my dear.

19:07.522 --> 19:09.566
Let me kiss that pretty face.

19:29.711 --> 19:32.589
Keep your people inside
until this has been cleared up.

19:34.591 --> 19:37.010
The sole supporter of a
large family, they say.

19:37.052 --> 19:38.845
Well, can't anything be done for them?

19:38.928 --> 19:40.680
Wait for me, <i>Maman.</i>

19:45.143 --> 19:47.687
Stand back.
Move aside. Stand back.

19:47.729 --> 19:49.522
I have you to thank for that.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.445
Oh! Oh, what a good fellow!

19:56.363 --> 19:58.031
What a good fellow.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.033
<i>Have you known Count Vronsky long?</i>

20:00.700 --> 20:03.036
Did you like him? He's in love with Kitty.

20:03.703 --> 20:04.954
Oh.

20:07.165 --> 20:10.085
But we should be discussing you and Dolly.

20:10.168 --> 20:11.544
What have you got to say for yourself?

20:11.628 --> 20:14.589
I've said it all. On my knees, in tears.

20:14.673 --> 20:15.882
Now I need you to say it.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.717
I'm going to the office,
so you'll have Dolly to yourself.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.302
Don't be late home.

20:20.220 --> 20:21.805
Oh, dear.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.850
Kitty's coming by to see you.

20:25.892 --> 20:29.062
She's all grown up
and a bit frightened of you.

20:29.145 --> 20:31.231
The belle of St. Petersburg society.

20:31.272 --> 20:33.608
Is that who I am?

20:37.112 --> 20:38.446
Dolly.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.409
Stiva has told me.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.914
Oh, Dolly, I'm sorry.

20:48.123 --> 20:50.250
From the bottom of my heart.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.836
I don't know what to do.

20:53.086 --> 20:55.171
I know. I know.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.465
I can't bear to be with him.

20:57.799 --> 21:00.260
And he doesn't care.
He's got what he wants.

21:00.301 --> 21:03.763
What he wants is you. He loves you, Dolly.

21:03.847 --> 21:06.057
You and the children
are everything to him.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.392
Are we?

21:07.434 --> 21:09.144
And there is room for a governess?

21:09.227 --> 21:12.605
That was shameful,
disgraceful, but it was not love.

21:13.148 --> 21:15.942
It was the animal in man, not the soul.

21:16.026 --> 21:17.944
Stiva's remorse is from the soul.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.488
Well, what about me?

21:21.448 --> 21:23.825
Does his remorse make it easier for me?

21:23.908 --> 21:27.037
I know you are suffering.
But, Dolly, you must tell me.

21:27.912 --> 21:31.791
Is there enough love left in your heart?
Enough to forgive him?

21:34.044 --> 21:38.006
Well, when I think of them together,
I can't forgive him.

21:38.089 --> 21:39.132
No.

21:39.299 --> 21:42.886
My poor lamb.
So you would rather accept your fate?

21:42.969 --> 21:44.137
My fate?

21:45.513 --> 21:48.808
But I haven't done anything!
It's him who...

21:48.892 --> 21:50.560
Do you love him, Dolly?

21:56.149 --> 21:58.651
You love him, and he loves you.

21:58.735 --> 22:00.153
But you can't forgive.

22:00.195 --> 22:03.323
So, your lives must continue like this
forever, with both of you wretched.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.996
Oh, that's pretty. Is
that a wedding dress?

22:10.080 --> 22:11.289
Yes.

22:11.331 --> 22:12.832
Look for the "G" for "Grisha."

22:12.874 --> 22:15.126
- Here.
- Oh.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.628
Can you do your whole name?

22:16.670 --> 22:18.755
Doesn't that look like a princess? No?

22:20.006 --> 22:23.301
I'm home! Home, home, home!

22:23.343 --> 22:25.470
Now, where are my little ducklings?

22:27.806 --> 22:29.683
Papa! Papa!

22:29.766 --> 22:31.017
Papa!

22:34.854 --> 22:37.107
Will you stay
for the Bobrishchevs' ball, Anna?

22:37.190 --> 22:39.401
Oh. I always feel dull at a ball.

22:39.693 --> 22:41.069
Ah!

22:41.695 --> 22:44.239
Stiva, tell Anna she
must come to the ball.

22:44.322 --> 22:45.907
Well, of course she must.

22:48.368 --> 22:49.661
And God go with you.

22:51.121 --> 22:53.206
You can introduce me
to your new governess.

22:53.248 --> 22:55.792
But she's old! She's a hundred!

22:58.586 --> 23:00.005
I know why you want me to come.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.382
You want everyone to be there

23:02.465 --> 23:05.093
because you're quite sure
it's going to be your night.

23:05.176 --> 23:06.886
How did you know?

23:08.805 --> 23:10.056
I know everything.

23:12.809 --> 23:14.769
Oh, to be your age again.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.272
Surrounded by that...

23:17.856 --> 23:19.232
That blue mist.

23:20.233 --> 23:22.235
I was 18, too, when I got married.

23:39.419 --> 23:41.129
Is the prince at home?

23:41.588 --> 23:43.465
He's just gone up, I believe.

23:43.548 --> 23:45.342
Is nobody receiving?

23:45.425 --> 23:48.470
I can enquire, sir. I don't think so.

23:49.721 --> 23:53.266
The princess retired early.
Is there a message?

24:03.777 --> 24:05.528
No. Thank you.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.955
We thought you would come back married.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.206
Did you?

25:01.543 --> 25:03.920
But you only came back with a hat.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.464
A black silk hat.

25:07.465 --> 25:10.010
What kind of animal
can you make a hat like that from?

25:10.093 --> 25:11.636
It's not natural.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.889
Next time, perhaps.

25:15.807 --> 25:17.726
There'll be no next time.

26:06.399 --> 26:07.442
Kitty.

26:09.110 --> 26:10.153
May I have a waltz?

26:10.236 --> 26:11.988
You may, Boris.

26:12.072 --> 26:15.075
I'll save you the third,
just because it's your first ball.

26:15.116 --> 26:16.743
You're my first conquest!

26:45.230 --> 26:47.273
Where do you want to be taken?

26:48.274 --> 26:49.526
There.

27:07.293 --> 27:08.294
How are you, Stiva?

27:08.378 --> 27:11.172
Thanks to Anna, I am a happy man.
Would you like to dance?

27:11.256 --> 27:12.924
No. Ask Anna.

27:13.216 --> 27:14.801
No, I don't...

27:18.013 --> 27:20.306
- Come on, then.
- Oh! Look out!

27:57.844 --> 28:01.222
This vile, idiotic matchmaking of yours.

28:01.306 --> 28:03.683
For goodness' sake, what have I done?

28:05.143 --> 28:06.728
Is anything the matter?

28:06.811 --> 28:08.021
No.

28:12.567 --> 28:15.153
You look as lovely as
ever, Princess Kitty.

28:24.412 --> 28:26.289
Don't ask me, <i>Maman.</i>

28:27.040 --> 28:28.708
Kitty, it's us next.

28:31.044 --> 28:34.172
Princess, I have the
honor to claim my dance.

28:54.275 --> 28:57.445
He'll dance the mazurka with Kitty.
You'll see.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.635
I am! I really am!

29:28.184 --> 29:29.686
Dance with me.

29:31.688 --> 29:33.481
I'm not used to being spoken to like that

29:33.565 --> 29:35.692
by a man I met once at a railway station.

29:35.775 --> 29:38.278
I dare say, but if I'm
not to dance with you,

29:38.361 --> 29:41.281
then I'm getting out of this operetta
and going home.

29:42.532 --> 29:44.117
Then, for Kitty's sake.

31:17.711 --> 31:18.878
That's my sister.

33:06.569 --> 33:10.990
Next stop is Bologoye!
Bologoye, next stop.

33:33.888 --> 33:35.682
Can I be of service to you?

33:39.436 --> 33:40.937
Why are you leaving Moscow?

33:42.856 --> 33:44.399
What else can I do?

33:46.192 --> 33:47.527
I have to be where you are.

33:47.610 --> 33:49.154
Stop, that's enough.

33:50.280 --> 33:51.406
Go back to Kitty.

33:52.323 --> 33:53.366
No.

33:54.701 --> 33:55.994
This is wrong.

33:56.036 --> 33:57.412
It makes no difference.

33:57.704 --> 33:58.788
You have no right.

33:58.872 --> 34:00.373
It makes no difference.

34:01.833 --> 34:03.376
You must forget me.

34:04.502 --> 34:06.379
If you're a good man,
you'll forget everything.

34:06.755 --> 34:08.965
And you? Will you forget?

34:11.384 --> 34:12.677
Yes.

34:45.918 --> 34:47.170
Is Serozha all right?

34:47.253 --> 34:48.755
Oh, is that all I get?

34:48.797 --> 34:49.922
Yes, he's quite well.

34:51.466 --> 34:52.759
Were you a success?

34:52.801 --> 34:53.927
I?

34:53.967 --> 34:55.594
Oh, Dolly and Stiva.

34:56.513 --> 34:57.847
Yes, I think so.

35:02.769 --> 35:04.562
- I'll announce myself.
- Very good, sir.

35:05.772 --> 35:08.483
Vronsky. The master himself.

35:09.234 --> 35:11.444
Baroness, coffee from
the new coffee pot for Count Vronsky.

35:12.946 --> 35:14.531
I'll be off home if I'm in the way.

35:14.823 --> 35:16.991
You're at home where you are, Baroness.

35:17.075 --> 35:19.994
Oh! Oh, Pierre, you never say
such pretty things to me.

35:20.286 --> 35:22.080
We were just discussing my husband.

35:22.122 --> 35:24.124
He won't divorce me, you see,
and do you know why?

35:24.165 --> 35:25.625
No.

35:25.626 --> 35:27.085
Because he likes eating
off my family silver.

35:27.127 --> 35:28.378
I want to bring an action.

35:28.461 --> 35:30.046
Just because I'm supposed
to be unfaithful,

35:30.130 --> 35:32.090
I don't see why I have to
eat off Pierre's crockery.

35:32.132 --> 35:33.299
Look at it!

35:34.134 --> 35:35.301
It's my crockery.

35:35.468 --> 35:36.469
Oh!

35:36.553 --> 35:38.013
How was Moscow?

35:38.888 --> 35:40.140
Provincial.

36:06.332 --> 36:07.667
Thank you for my presents.

36:42.369 --> 36:45.205
I'm writing to Dolly and to Kitty.

36:47.207 --> 36:48.708
You are good.

37:01.388 --> 37:02.931
Time for bed.

37:07.227 --> 37:10.397
What are they saying in Moscow
about the new statute?

37:11.189 --> 37:12.691
What new statute?

37:14.192 --> 37:15.735
The new statute I carried in Council.

37:18.363 --> 37:19.739
No one mentioned it.

37:20.699 --> 37:21.908
Really?

37:23.910 --> 37:24.994
Oh.

37:27.706 --> 37:30.000
Here, it caused quite a sensation.

38:02.282 --> 38:03.366
Princess Betsy.

38:03.867 --> 38:04.868
Cousin.

38:04.951 --> 38:06.911
I didn't know you were an art lover.

38:06.953 --> 38:08.538
I'm prepared to be one.

38:49.788 --> 38:51.081
Countess Lydia tells me

38:51.164 --> 38:53.750
you haven't been to
one of her evenings since you returned.

38:53.833 --> 38:55.168
The last one was to meet a missionary.

38:55.251 --> 38:56.336
The one before that

38:56.419 --> 38:59.547
was for a lecture on
the union of the Greek and Roman Churches.

39:01.633 --> 39:03.510
Oh, I'm sorry.

39:03.551 --> 39:05.261
I know you're fond of her.

39:06.513 --> 39:08.181
Come on, or we'll be late.

39:28.702 --> 39:30.328
Here's the thing, Vronsky.

39:30.370 --> 39:33.206
A posting's come up,
and there's a promotion in it for you.

39:33.248 --> 39:34.249
Thank you, sir.

39:34.332 --> 39:35.917
In the garrison in Tashkent.

39:36.001 --> 39:37.877
Tashkent? But...

39:39.254 --> 39:42.841
I would like to stay in Peter, sir,
if you don't mind.

39:43.216 --> 39:44.801
Well, I don't mind.

39:46.094 --> 39:49.556
But your mother... It's her idea.

40:06.364 --> 40:08.450
Your husband is a saint,

40:08.783 --> 40:11.578
and we must all cherish him
for Russia's sake.

40:18.084 --> 40:20.295
You didn't come to my dinner.

40:20.378 --> 40:21.880
I had to see my Commanding Officer.

40:21.921 --> 40:24.257
Well, "she" didn't come either.

40:27.927 --> 40:29.888
I do hope you can come on afterwards.

40:30.263 --> 40:33.933
Father Kristof's report on the Chinese
mission will be with lantern slides.

40:35.018 --> 40:36.895
I'm expected at the Tverskoys'.

40:37.771 --> 40:39.105
No doubt.

40:40.357 --> 40:42.776
But I'm sure that
Princess Betsy can wait for you.

40:51.326 --> 40:53.912
Yes, in fact, I don't think
I will go to Betsy's.

40:54.037 --> 40:55.330
You're caught.

40:57.207 --> 41:00.001
I'm afraid I'm becoming quite ridiculous.

41:31.491 --> 41:32.992
Now, there's a phenomenon.

41:33.118 --> 41:36.329
Look, Anna's shadow
has arrived before Anna.

41:36.788 --> 41:38.331
I'm Anna's friend.

41:38.581 --> 41:40.500
But all this making up
one's mind to it in public

41:40.583 --> 41:43.211
is not polite to
a distinguished man like Karenin.

41:43.294 --> 41:47.340
In my opinion, Karenin is a fool
and Anna is the best of us.

41:47.424 --> 41:50.510
And we all love you for your
contrary opinions, Princess.

42:06.526 --> 42:08.528
Alexei, you look desperate.

42:10.071 --> 42:11.906
It's not attractive.

42:12.198 --> 42:13.533
I'm losing hope.

42:13.616 --> 42:14.951
Hope of what?

42:15.035 --> 42:17.120
Persuading a virtuous woman
to break her marriage vows?

42:19.372 --> 42:20.582
No, you're right.

42:22.417 --> 42:23.793
She won't come.

42:58.411 --> 42:59.788
He's gone.

42:59.913 --> 43:02.082
But you're just in time for the surprise.

43:41.246 --> 43:42.789
Turn around!

43:43.623 --> 43:47.043
May I have the honor
of bringing you an ice?

43:52.799 --> 43:54.968
Ices are being served.

43:58.221 --> 44:00.682
I would prefer to try a cigarette.

44:16.823 --> 44:18.241
<i>Courage.</i>

44:18.658 --> 44:19.993
I'll try another one sometime.

44:20.994 --> 44:22.162
When?

44:22.829 --> 44:24.039
Where?

44:24.247 --> 44:27.459
Just as I was thinking
your manners had improved since Moscow.

44:27.542 --> 44:28.877
You behaved badly.

44:28.960 --> 44:30.253
Very badly.

44:30.420 --> 44:32.380
And who was responsible for that?

44:36.176 --> 44:37.969
Give me a cup of tea.

44:43.600 --> 44:44.768
How nice!

44:44.851 --> 44:46.686
Alexei Alexandrovich has arrived.

44:49.147 --> 44:51.524
I'm not sure my nerves
can stand another Alexei at this moment.

44:58.365 --> 45:00.033
Were you glad to see me or not?

45:00.116 --> 45:02.702
So the Schuzburgs asked us to dinner.

45:02.744 --> 45:07.040
The sauce was said to have cost a
thousand rubles, and it was ghastly.

45:12.879 --> 45:16.675
I gave them a sauce
that cost 85 kopeks and it was a triumph.

45:18.385 --> 45:19.969
This must stop.

45:20.220 --> 45:21.930
You make me feel
as if I were guilty of something.

45:22.013 --> 45:23.223
What do you want me to do?

45:23.807 --> 45:26.017
I want you to go to Moscow
and beg Kitty to forgive you.

45:26.059 --> 45:27.560
No, that's not what you want.

45:27.602 --> 45:29.646
Moscow? I can do better than that.

45:30.230 --> 45:32.982
Tonight I refused a posting to Tashkent.

45:33.733 --> 45:36.236
I can change my mind,
and you'll never see me again.

45:37.946 --> 45:40.407
If you have any thought for me,
you will give me back my peace.

45:40.490 --> 45:41.991
I have no peace to give.

45:42.242 --> 45:43.868
There can be no peace for us.

45:43.910 --> 45:46.913
Only misery or the greatest happiness.

45:49.082 --> 45:51.042
Your husband is impossible.

45:51.084 --> 45:52.168
His opinions are all wrong,

45:52.252 --> 45:54.379
but he talks so brilliantly,
he wins every argument.

45:54.421 --> 45:55.839
What?

45:56.047 --> 45:57.298
I called to take you home.

45:57.882 --> 45:59.134
No, I'm staying.

45:59.759 --> 46:01.803
Send the carriage back for me.

46:01.886 --> 46:02.971
Of course.

46:24.075 --> 46:26.453
Do you want me to go to Tashkent?

46:39.591 --> 46:40.967
So I'll go to Tashkent.

46:41.092 --> 46:42.218
No!

46:45.805 --> 46:47.307
I don't want you to go.

47:17.045 --> 47:19.172
I stayed up to talk to you.

47:25.679 --> 47:26.805
What about?

47:28.223 --> 47:29.641
It's late.

47:30.558 --> 47:32.268
Where's Annushka?

47:35.480 --> 47:36.690
I sent her off.

47:39.609 --> 47:40.777
Well.

47:42.529 --> 47:44.531
If you want to talk, but
we should go to bed.

47:44.698 --> 47:45.990
I must warn you about something.

47:46.032 --> 47:47.117
Warn me?

47:49.828 --> 47:51.162
Oh, it's really rather late.

47:51.204 --> 47:53.248
I wish to warn you that
you may, inadvertently

47:54.249 --> 47:56.459
by indiscretion and carelessness,

47:56.543 --> 47:58.211
give the world occasion to talk about you.

47:58.253 --> 47:59.796
I am not a committee.

48:01.047 --> 48:02.507
Please say what you want to tell me.

48:05.969 --> 48:08.054
You and Count Vronsky
attracted attention tonight.

48:10.682 --> 48:12.517
You don't like it when I
don't talk to people,

48:12.559 --> 48:13.893
and you don't like it when I do.

48:13.935 --> 48:15.395
I didn't notice anything myself,

48:15.437 --> 48:16.688
but I saw everyone else noticed.

48:18.106 --> 48:21.818
I consider jealousy to be insulting
to you and degrading to me.

48:21.901 --> 48:23.862
I have no right to inquire
into your feelings.

48:24.487 --> 48:26.281
They concern only your conscience.

48:26.614 --> 48:30.035
But it's my duty to remind you
that we are bound together by God,

48:30.076 --> 48:33.580
and this bond
can only be broken by a crime against God.

48:33.955 --> 48:36.124
I have nothing to say to you.

48:37.584 --> 48:38.918
And you have a son.

48:39.294 --> 48:40.670
And I'm tired.

48:51.348 --> 48:53.892
If I am wrong, I ask your pardon.

48:56.686 --> 48:58.938
I don't know what you're talking about,

48:59.022 --> 49:00.899
and it's really too late for this.

49:04.611 --> 49:05.862
Excuse me, please.

49:15.288 --> 49:16.623
Too late.

50:32.866 --> 50:34.951
Oh, God! Oh, forgive me!

50:35.785 --> 50:37.370
It's the end of everything.

50:37.537 --> 50:39.873
I've got nothing left now except you,
remember that.

50:41.916 --> 50:44.044
How could I not remember?

50:45.712 --> 50:47.547
You're my happiness.

50:52.802 --> 50:54.387
Happiness?

50:54.429 --> 50:56.473
You murdered my happiness.

50:57.432 --> 50:58.892
Murderer.

50:59.267 --> 51:00.643
Murderer.

51:02.062 --> 51:03.313
Go on.

51:03.480 --> 51:04.731
Yes.

51:05.732 --> 51:07.192
Go on. Murderer.

51:08.443 --> 51:09.611
Murderer.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.086
Look out, here they come.

51:28.421 --> 51:30.048
Oh, bad luck.

51:39.349 --> 51:41.101
<i>Potage aux choux Ã  la russe!</i>

51:41.601 --> 51:43.353
Agafia, if you opened up in Moscow,

51:43.520 --> 51:45.480
the l'Angleterre would go out of business.

51:47.982 --> 51:49.401
It's true.

51:49.526 --> 51:51.945
- Do you want news of Moscow?
- Babylon? No.

51:52.278 --> 51:53.655
Oh, you're right, what do you care?

51:53.738 --> 51:55.031
You love the country, you've got it.

51:55.115 --> 51:57.575
You love agriculturing,
and, Lord knows, you've got that.

51:57.659 --> 51:58.952
You love shooting, you've got that.

51:58.993 --> 52:00.370
- You've got everything you want.
- Ha!

52:02.330 --> 52:03.957
All right, go on, then.

52:03.998 --> 52:05.458
Have you stopped stealing bread rolls?

52:06.626 --> 52:09.295
Ballet girl, Oriental type.
How can I help it?

52:10.547 --> 52:11.798
How is...

52:11.840 --> 52:13.299
How are the Shcherbatskys?

52:13.591 --> 52:14.634
You mean Kitty.

52:15.802 --> 52:17.345
- Is she engaged now?
- No.

52:17.637 --> 52:20.056
Vronsky went back to St. Petersburg.

52:20.473 --> 52:21.766
Huh.

52:22.058 --> 52:24.686
Kitty will be seeing
Dolly at Ergoshovo in the summer.

52:25.228 --> 52:26.312
You could...

52:26.438 --> 52:28.148
Oh, yes, as if I had time in the summer.

52:28.189 --> 52:30.734
And I've got extra land
at Kashin this year for the haymaking.

52:30.817 --> 52:32.736
Kashin? That's on the
Ergoshovo road, isn't it?

52:32.986 --> 52:34.320
Couldn't you see Kitty when she's there?

52:34.446 --> 52:36.948
Especially, not then. I
humiliated myself once.

52:36.990 --> 52:39.325
Oh, damn you, Kostya. You love Kitty.

52:40.785 --> 52:42.328
You love Kitty and you can't forgive her

52:42.412 --> 52:44.622
because, first, you funked it,
and then you bungled it.

52:44.664 --> 52:46.458
And then you ran away
from an 18-year-old girl

52:46.499 --> 52:49.085
who was made a fool of by a uniform.

52:49.669 --> 52:51.338
It's not you I feel sorry for, it's Kitty.

52:51.379 --> 52:52.714
Her heart told her no.

52:54.132 --> 52:57.052
Did you come to shoot
snipe or criticize me?

53:04.642 --> 53:06.186
Well, don't hold him like a parcel.

53:06.770 --> 53:09.272
Oh! It's Aunt Kitty, darling.

53:11.107 --> 53:14.277
Doesn't he make you ashamed
of dwelling on your troubles?

53:14.361 --> 53:15.570
I have no troubles.

53:16.154 --> 53:18.448
That man wasn't worth
the tears, believe me.

53:18.531 --> 53:21.785
I don't care about him.
I don't even think about him, or her.

53:22.535 --> 53:24.162
Except to hate her.

53:25.038 --> 53:27.540
Then we'll never speak of it again.

53:30.043 --> 53:32.629
There are better men waiting for you.

53:33.213 --> 53:34.714
Stiva says...

53:38.760 --> 53:41.346
Kitty, my lamb, did Konstantin...

53:41.429 --> 53:43.723
What has Levin got to do with it?

53:43.765 --> 53:45.725
Anyway, I'll never get married.

53:45.809 --> 53:49.479
The whole business of it
has become disgusting to me.

53:49.562 --> 53:51.815
And look what it's done for you.
Why do they call it love?

53:54.484 --> 53:56.236
Because it's love.

54:01.408 --> 54:02.742
I want you to, I don't care about it.

54:02.826 --> 54:03.910
You should care.

54:04.244 --> 54:06.746
Anyway, someone might be watching.

54:19.467 --> 54:21.428
But I'm damned, anyway.

54:21.845 --> 54:23.930
I'm not. I'm blessed.

54:26.683 --> 54:28.435
- You love me.
- Yes.

54:28.476 --> 54:29.894
- Only me.
- No.

54:32.647 --> 54:34.691
- Apart from Frou-Frou?
- Yes.

54:34.983 --> 54:36.985
But me more than your horse?

54:37.068 --> 54:38.111
Yes.

54:41.072 --> 54:42.657
Are you happy?

54:43.491 --> 54:44.659
Yes.

54:46.453 --> 54:47.954
And you love me?

54:47.996 --> 54:49.205
Yes.

54:50.999 --> 54:52.083
How much?

54:53.126 --> 54:54.252
This much.

54:56.087 --> 54:57.172
This much?

54:57.589 --> 54:58.673
Yes.

54:59.132 --> 55:00.800
- This much?
- Yes.

55:00.967 --> 55:02.135
And this much?

55:02.761 --> 55:03.970
Yes.

55:04.137 --> 55:05.180
This much?

55:05.263 --> 55:06.681
Yes.

55:06.806 --> 55:08.975
This much? And this much?

55:26.409 --> 55:28.286
So, this is love.

55:29.579 --> 55:30.997
This.

55:35.669 --> 55:36.753
Countess.

55:39.089 --> 55:41.216
I thought you would be at Peterhof now.

55:41.299 --> 55:42.592
I've come from there.

55:42.801 --> 55:45.512
I'm distressed that you haven't
taken your usual house this year.

55:45.845 --> 55:47.681
Anna wanted a change.

55:48.264 --> 55:51.226
Nearer to Princess Betsy at Tsarskoe Selo.

55:53.561 --> 55:55.939
The guards are in summer camp at Tsarskoe.

55:57.232 --> 55:59.025
Alexei Alexandrovich,

56:00.527 --> 56:02.195
forgive me, but...

56:03.780 --> 56:05.990
You are too tolerant. Your wife is...

56:06.032 --> 56:08.368
Oh! Is this about my wife?

56:08.410 --> 56:10.537
My wife is beyond reproach.

56:11.371 --> 56:13.498
She is, after all, my wife.

56:26.553 --> 56:28.388
Alyosha! Alyosha!

56:31.474 --> 56:33.018
A message from <i>Maman.</i>

56:33.184 --> 56:35.311
Her friend Princess
Sorokina has a house here

56:35.395 --> 56:37.647
and a virgin daughter.

56:37.772 --> 56:39.649
Well, that's not part of the message,

56:39.733 --> 56:41.109
but they'll all be at the races

56:41.192 --> 56:42.777
and you're expected to supper afterwards.

56:43.028 --> 56:45.655
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

56:45.739 --> 56:48.241
I give you the regiment!

56:49.075 --> 56:50.910
The regiment!

56:55.623 --> 56:57.584
I heard you turned down a promotion.

56:57.625 --> 56:59.627
That was <i>Maman </i> interfering.

56:59.711 --> 57:00.795
Yes.

57:01.046 --> 57:02.756
And now she's come up
with a princess for you.

57:05.467 --> 57:08.595
Alexei, we're brothers,
so don't take offense.

57:09.304 --> 57:12.098
Getting married puts
the pack on your back.

57:12.140 --> 57:14.893
It leaves your hands free
for climbing the ladder.

57:16.936 --> 57:18.813
Getting serious about a married woman

57:18.897 --> 57:20.357
is like carrying your pack in your arms.

57:20.440 --> 57:22.108
So, they talk about me.

57:24.903 --> 57:26.654
I'm leaving, Sasha.

57:27.947 --> 57:29.449
An assignation?

57:29.532 --> 57:31.326
Come on, I'll introduce you.

57:34.954 --> 57:36.331
Beautiful.

57:37.374 --> 57:39.584
A man would come to no harm.

57:42.420 --> 57:44.297
Do you think you'll win tomorrow?

57:44.673 --> 57:46.341
Makhotin's Gladiator is favorite.

57:47.008 --> 57:48.510
Sixteen hands.

57:48.968 --> 57:50.387
Frou-Frou looks dainty beside him.

57:51.346 --> 57:53.098
But she's got heart.

57:53.431 --> 57:54.808
Haven't you, my darling?

58:11.324 --> 58:12.492
Anna.

58:14.744 --> 58:16.121
Alexei!

58:16.705 --> 58:17.789
What is it?

58:18.707 --> 58:21.501
I couldn't bear not to
see you before the race.

58:28.675 --> 58:30.844
What were you thinking about?

58:35.015 --> 58:36.391
Tell me.

58:38.601 --> 58:40.103
I'm pregnant.

58:42.230 --> 58:43.690
Oh, my love.

58:46.693 --> 58:48.653
Well, love was never a game to us.

58:49.112 --> 58:51.698
Here's an end to living in corners,

58:51.781 --> 58:53.366
existing day to day on lies.

58:53.825 --> 58:55.368
Yes.

58:55.785 --> 58:57.704
Now we can be together.

58:58.580 --> 59:00.373
How can we, Alexei?

59:00.540 --> 59:02.542
Tell Karenin everything.

59:02.667 --> 59:04.627
Do you think my husband
will make you a present of me?

59:04.711 --> 59:05.837
Leave him.

59:05.879 --> 59:07.255
Leave him and be your mistress?

59:07.339 --> 59:09.049
Yes, run away.

59:12.260 --> 59:14.554
I would never see my son again.

59:15.597 --> 59:17.349
The laws are made by husbands and fathers.

59:17.390 --> 59:18.767
What, then?

59:20.310 --> 59:22.896
I'll never forgive myself
for your unhappiness.

59:23.396 --> 59:24.898
Unhappiness?

59:25.899 --> 59:28.360
I'm like a starving beggar
who's been given food.

59:29.235 --> 59:30.570
I, unhappy?

59:32.364 --> 59:33.573
No.

59:35.617 --> 59:37.535
This is my happiness.

59:40.038 --> 59:41.664
Serozha!

59:43.583 --> 59:45.293
Serozha, I'm coming to get you!

59:50.465 --> 59:52.008
Where are you?

59:53.968 --> 59:55.428
Serozha!

59:57.389 --> 59:58.932
Where are you?

01:00:00.558 --> 01:00:02.560
How are you, young man?

01:00:03.186 --> 01:00:04.771
Your tutor doesn't seem to be in evidence.

01:00:04.854 --> 01:00:06.106
Yah!

01:00:10.235 --> 01:00:11.611
Alexei.

01:00:11.945 --> 01:00:14.155
You got away at last. Can you stay?

01:00:14.614 --> 01:00:15.865
Why?

01:00:17.826 --> 01:00:19.911
Go and find Vasily Lukich.

01:00:21.621 --> 01:00:22.789
I have to change.

01:00:22.831 --> 01:00:24.666
Princess Betsy is sending her trap for me.

01:00:24.749 --> 01:00:27.502
Would you like to come?
She's taking me to watch the race.

01:00:27.794 --> 01:00:29.379
Races, surely.

01:00:29.629 --> 01:00:33.049
No, I'll come on later.
Then I must get back to town.

01:01:08.585 --> 01:01:09.919
Yes!

01:01:22.724 --> 01:01:24.142
Princess! Princess!

01:01:24.184 --> 01:01:25.935
A bet! Who do you fancy in the next?

01:01:26.603 --> 01:01:27.771
Kusolev.

01:01:28.021 --> 01:01:29.898
I'm on Vronsky. Pair of gloves?

01:01:30.607 --> 01:01:32.192
Done.

01:01:36.488 --> 01:01:38.531
Alexander Vronsky.

01:01:51.378 --> 01:01:53.380
You are an exquisite creature.

01:01:53.421 --> 01:01:55.590
You really ought to be
the spoils of victory today.

01:02:42.929 --> 01:02:44.347
Yah! Yah!

01:02:49.144 --> 01:02:50.895
Go, Frou-Frou! Go!

01:02:57.569 --> 01:02:58.653
Go!

01:03:05.035 --> 01:03:06.953
Go, Frou-Frou! Go!

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.793
Alexei!

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:21.634
I'm here.

01:03:26.306 --> 01:03:28.016
Oh.

01:03:32.145 --> 01:03:33.146
I'm here.

01:03:37.192 --> 01:03:38.276
Get up!

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.488
Get up!

01:03:44.115 --> 01:03:45.408
Her back is broken.

01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:05.011
You know...

01:04:09.015 --> 01:04:12.185
They say the Emperor
disapproves of the races.

01:04:12.894 --> 01:04:14.229
The danger of injury.

01:04:14.312 --> 01:04:15.397
But I...

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.648
What?

01:04:18.358 --> 01:04:23.238
I'm saying I think there's
a value in manly sport, for the military.

01:04:24.864 --> 01:04:26.199
I don't understand.

01:04:27.534 --> 01:04:32.038
In my opinion, it's not the sport itself.
It's the spectacle.

01:04:32.706 --> 01:04:34.749
It's making a cruel spectacle out of...

01:04:34.874 --> 01:04:36.710
What are you talking about?

01:04:39.671 --> 01:04:41.297
- I have to tell you...
- Yes.

01:04:41.381 --> 01:04:44.718
I have to tell you,
you behaved improperly today.

01:04:45.969 --> 01:04:47.137
How is that?

01:04:49.723 --> 01:04:53.351
By making plain your feeling
when one of the riders fell.

01:04:53.393 --> 01:04:55.687
Your conduct was improper.

01:04:56.396 --> 01:04:59.941
It must not occur again.
I have said it before.

01:05:02.861 --> 01:05:06.072
You will say my concern
is unnecessary and ridiculous.

01:05:06.114 --> 01:05:07.741
You are my wife.

01:05:08.908 --> 01:05:10.910
I'm wrong to think that.

01:05:13.204 --> 01:05:14.414
Yes?

01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:16.708
Perhaps I was mistaken...

01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:18.168
No.

01:05:19.419 --> 01:05:21.296
You were not mistaken.

01:05:24.674 --> 01:05:26.217
I love him.

01:05:28.428 --> 01:05:30.263
I am his mistress.

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:36.061
Do what you like to me.

01:05:50.408 --> 01:05:51.910
Wait. Please, move away.

01:05:57.916 --> 01:06:01.586
I will not have a scandal. Therefore,
you will not see this man again.

01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:05.924
You will behave in a way
that nothing is known against you

01:06:06.007 --> 01:06:07.801
by society or by the servants.

01:06:08.009 --> 01:06:12.972
In return, you will keep
the privileges of a wife, and the duties.

01:06:13.431 --> 01:06:16.309
Tomorrow you will return home.
That is all.

01:06:48.717 --> 01:06:50.385
Are you hurt?

01:06:54.097 --> 01:06:55.724
What's happened?

01:06:56.599 --> 01:06:58.852
I told him I'm your mistress.

01:06:59.769 --> 01:07:01.521
He thinks I can give you
up and go on living.

01:07:01.604 --> 01:07:03.356
No. You cannot.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.404
Time for bed?

01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:05.251
It was pleasant to hear
you being congratulated on your husband.

01:08:06.461 --> 01:08:08.171
Not that I care for decorations, but...

01:08:08.421 --> 01:08:10.090
Alexei, I can't. I'm sorry.

01:08:11.216 --> 01:08:12.342
Oh.

01:08:13.426 --> 01:08:15.387
But I'm his wife, now.

01:08:21.935 --> 01:08:23.770
I'm having his child.

01:08:57.595 --> 01:09:00.180
Tell me what I did to deserve this.

01:09:30.127 --> 01:09:31.171
Halt!

01:09:55.028 --> 01:09:57.030
How many mowers is it, Theodore?

01:09:57.113 --> 01:09:59.199
Forty-two, Master.

01:09:59.908 --> 01:10:03.661
In your father's time,
it was work for two days for 30 men.

01:10:03.745 --> 01:10:05.538
Though he never picked
up a scythe himself.

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:09.292
The men don't like me for it.

01:10:09.417 --> 01:10:11.586
They like what they're used to.

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.338
It settles me.

01:10:13.421 --> 01:10:14.631
How is that, Master?

01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:18.385
When I'm mowing,
I don't ask myself why I'm here.

01:10:18.426 --> 01:10:21.012
You're here to be
Master Konstantin Dmitrievich.

01:10:21.221 --> 01:10:23.390
As it's always been, by the grace of God.

01:10:23.765 --> 01:10:26.059
My father owned you, Theodore.

01:10:26.685 --> 01:10:29.145
Owned you like chattels
to be bought and sold.

01:10:29.396 --> 01:10:30.897
Was that by the grace of God?

01:10:32.607 --> 01:10:33.983
It was.

01:10:34.567 --> 01:10:36.736
That's my youngest
you were looking at, there.

01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:41.574
His young life is perilous now since the
freedom came and work must be found.

01:10:42.409 --> 01:10:44.244
They look happier than I've ever been.

01:10:47.414 --> 01:10:50.208
Is it living simply that I'm looking for?

01:12:26.596 --> 01:12:28.139
I'm expected.

01:12:31.685 --> 01:12:32.894
No.

01:12:34.062 --> 01:12:36.189
I will not live like this.

01:12:37.732 --> 01:12:39.901
This waiting for hour after hour,

01:12:40.026 --> 01:12:42.195
not knowing when I'll ever see you again.

01:12:43.029 --> 01:12:44.197
Sorry.

01:12:45.281 --> 01:12:46.991
It's my demon. I can't help it.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.493
You wrote that you were ill.

01:12:48.535 --> 01:12:49.744
Don't worry, it won't be for long.

01:12:49.828 --> 01:12:51.287
- Stop.
- No, it's true.

01:12:51.371 --> 01:12:52.706
I was told it in a dream.

01:12:52.747 --> 01:12:54.040
There. It was only a bad dream.

01:12:54.124 --> 01:12:55.750
Yes, and I'm only
going to die having your baby.

01:12:55.834 --> 01:12:58.336
- That's all nonsense.
- Tell me it is.

01:12:59.087 --> 01:13:00.797
Tell me it is.

01:13:02.841 --> 01:13:04.217
You love me, only me.

01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:07.095
Your note said your husband would be out.

01:13:07.262 --> 01:13:09.764
He was late. It serves him right.

01:13:12.976 --> 01:13:14.394
And you...

01:13:14.853 --> 01:13:16.563
Why do you call him my husband?

01:13:16.604 --> 01:13:18.064
He isn't my husband, he's a clock.

01:13:18.148 --> 01:13:21.067
But it was awkward. My honor.
You made an agreement.

01:13:21.151 --> 01:13:24.112
Do you think of your honor when you're
sharing whores with your Colonel?

01:13:24.195 --> 01:13:25.905
Your demon again?

01:13:27.323 --> 01:13:29.284
I'll be glad to die before
you start to hate me.

01:13:29.367 --> 01:13:30.660
Anna.

01:13:32.746 --> 01:13:34.289
Put your hand there.

01:13:35.957 --> 01:13:37.542
You can feel him move.

01:13:39.753 --> 01:13:42.464
I respectfully ask Minister Karenin

01:13:42.589 --> 01:13:48.178
whether his proposals for the regulation
of these colorful gypsy tribes

01:13:48.887 --> 01:13:52.182
of these scholarly,
God-fearing Jews, and of...

01:13:53.308 --> 01:13:56.811
But I'm afraid I've lost
the Minister's attention.

01:13:59.356 --> 01:14:00.440
Who is here?

01:14:00.523 --> 01:14:02.275
Only <i>Madame, </i> Your Excellency.

01:14:08.615 --> 01:14:10.158
I wanted to see him because...

01:14:10.241 --> 01:14:13.828
I do not wish to know
why a woman wants to see her lover.

01:14:14.621 --> 01:14:15.914
What are you doing?

01:14:16.081 --> 01:14:17.540
I want his letters!

01:14:23.129 --> 01:14:25.507
I am going to Moscow tomorrow,
and then the provinces

01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:28.343
with a commission to investigate
conditions among the Jews and gypsies,

01:14:28.468 --> 01:14:31.471
whose conditions
I infinitely prefer to my own.

01:14:31.554 --> 01:14:35.892
I will not return to this house until
divorce has driven you into the street.

01:14:35.975 --> 01:14:38.311
Meanwhile, my son will be sent
to live with my eldest sister.

01:14:38.645 --> 01:14:41.064
No, Alexei, please.
Please, leave me Serozha!

01:14:41.314 --> 01:14:43.400
Do you think I would let you have my son?

01:14:43.483 --> 01:14:45.568
You are depraved. A woman without honor.

01:14:45.694 --> 01:14:48.905
I thank God the curse of
love is lifted from me.

01:15:06.172 --> 01:15:08.216
I need your advice.

01:15:15.306 --> 01:15:17.559
- Come on, come on!
- Yes, yes.

01:15:22.105 --> 01:15:24.274
Right, after you, after you.

01:15:24.357 --> 01:15:26.109
- Are we late?
- Of course, you're late.

01:15:26.192 --> 01:15:28.361
I'm Countess Nordston.

01:15:28.403 --> 01:15:31.197
We nearly met at the
Shcherbatskys' last winter.

01:15:31.239 --> 01:15:32.699
Come into the fold.

01:15:32.824 --> 01:15:34.200
Come on.

01:15:36.953 --> 01:15:39.873
You've been waiting for me. Forgive me.

01:15:41.833 --> 01:15:43.418
Kitty is here.

01:15:46.504 --> 01:15:49.883
Konstantin, what a long time
since we saw each other.

01:15:50.508 --> 01:15:53.219
Since you saw me,
but I saw you not so long ago.

01:15:53.553 --> 01:15:54.596
When?

01:15:55.055 --> 01:15:56.473
You were driving to Ergoshovo.

01:15:56.556 --> 01:15:57.891
I was at Kashin for the haymaking.

01:15:58.058 --> 01:15:59.059
Oh, but why didn't you...

01:15:59.309 --> 01:16:00.935
I'm so glad to see you.

01:16:02.062 --> 01:16:03.646
You're just the same.

01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:07.442
I hope not.

01:16:08.568 --> 01:16:10.445
I was young and silly in those days.

01:16:10.862 --> 01:16:12.405
Months and months ago.

01:16:16.368 --> 01:16:17.786
And you haven't changed.

01:16:19.746 --> 01:16:22.082
No. I haven't.

01:16:27.170 --> 01:16:30.298
Permit me to announce,
um, soup Marie-Louise carp

01:16:30.382 --> 01:16:32.467
with asparagus and roast beef.

01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:34.552
I went to the market in person.

01:16:37.681 --> 01:16:39.265
An extra place.

01:16:41.351 --> 01:16:44.688
I've come to tell you
our connection must be severed.

01:16:45.855 --> 01:16:47.440
I'm going to divorce your sister.

01:16:48.692 --> 01:16:49.943
Divorce?

01:16:51.986 --> 01:16:53.780
Oh, dear me, what are you
talking about?

01:16:53.863 --> 01:16:55.573
Well, don't be in a hurry. Stay to dinner.

01:16:55.615 --> 01:16:56.616
And later, you can talk
it over with Dolly.

01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:58.952
Prince Oblonsky,
everything is over between our families.

01:16:59.035 --> 01:17:01.955
Alexei, divorce is one thing.
Dinner is quite another.

01:17:02.664 --> 01:17:06.084
You Petersburgers
think yourselves so <i>de bon ton</i>

01:17:06.126 --> 01:17:09.254
compared with dull, old-fashioned Moscow.

01:17:09.462 --> 01:17:11.631
But we know how to do things.

01:17:11.756 --> 01:17:12.841
Only the other day,

01:17:12.924 --> 01:17:15.844
I hear Vasya Pryachnikov
fought a duel with Kvitsky and killed him.

01:17:15.927 --> 01:17:17.012
Well, what...

01:17:17.095 --> 01:17:18.763
What was the challenge about?

01:17:18.805 --> 01:17:20.306
Pryachnikov's wife, naturally.

01:17:20.348 --> 01:17:22.934
It was a matter
of honor, defending a woman's honor.

01:17:22.976 --> 01:17:25.979
Sounds like barbarism to me.
What if the lover had killed the husband?

01:17:26.021 --> 01:17:28.648
Would that have preserved
the wife's honor, too?

01:17:28.690 --> 01:17:31.234
Still, not many of us can say
our lover died for love.

01:17:31.443 --> 01:17:32.652
Love?

01:17:32.902 --> 01:17:35.822
"Thou shall not covet
thy neighbor's wife."

01:17:45.373 --> 01:17:48.543
Would you die for love,
Konstantin Dmitrievich?

01:17:48.877 --> 01:17:51.004
I would. But not for my neighbor's wife.

01:17:55.091 --> 01:17:57.594
An impure love is not love to me.

01:17:58.261 --> 01:18:00.847
To admire another man's wife
is a pleasant thing,

01:18:01.723 --> 01:18:04.517
but sensual desire indulged
for its own sake is greed,

01:18:04.851 --> 01:18:06.519
a kind of gluttony,

01:18:06.603 --> 01:18:09.606
and a misuse of something sacred,
which is given to us

01:18:09.773 --> 01:18:13.026
so that we may choose the one person
with whom to fulfill our humanness.

01:18:16.363 --> 01:18:17.906
Otherwise, we might as well be cattle.

01:18:17.989 --> 01:18:19.616
Ah! An idealist!

01:18:26.247 --> 01:18:28.500
But she will be nobody's wife.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.251
She'll be ruined.

01:18:31.336 --> 01:18:33.963
I tried to save her. She chose ruin.

01:18:34.631 --> 01:18:36.007
Alexei Alexandrovich.

01:18:36.508 --> 01:18:37.717
Look at me.

01:18:39.928 --> 01:18:43.390
You will have no peace of mind
until you forgive her.

01:18:44.933 --> 01:18:46.893
It was Anna who taught me that.

01:18:47.018 --> 01:18:48.561
I do not wish to forgive.

01:18:48.603 --> 01:18:50.522
I'm not a cruel man.

01:18:50.563 --> 01:18:52.607
I've never hated anyone.

01:18:53.024 --> 01:18:54.776
But I hate her with all my soul

01:18:54.859 --> 01:18:57.362
for all the wrong she has done me.

01:18:59.072 --> 01:19:01.866
Now, it is
your turn to play us something, Countess.

01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:03.993
I thought you'd never ask.

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.537
Very good.

01:19:07.664 --> 01:19:09.749
Since we last met,

01:19:09.791 --> 01:19:12.919
there is something I have
often wanted to ask you.

01:19:12.961 --> 01:19:14.504
What is that?

01:19:25.098 --> 01:19:26.516
This.

01:19:29.686 --> 01:19:31.104
Do...

01:19:31.938 --> 01:19:32.981
Not...

01:19:38.945 --> 01:19:40.238
Did.

01:19:42.782 --> 01:19:43.950
Did not.

01:19:56.463 --> 01:19:58.465
The last word is "never."

01:21:09.494 --> 01:21:10.954
I know what it says.

01:21:35.186 --> 01:21:36.271
Then.

01:21:39.733 --> 01:21:40.942
But now?

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:50.869
Can you forgive

01:21:52.746 --> 01:21:54.122
and forget?

01:22:11.097 --> 01:22:12.682
I never stopped.

01:23:36.182 --> 01:23:37.934
Why doesn't he come?

01:23:39.144 --> 01:23:42.188
He is kind. He will forgive me.

01:23:45.233 --> 01:23:46.526
Her fever is higher.

01:23:46.609 --> 01:23:49.029
I want Alexei. Why doesn't he come?

01:23:49.571 --> 01:23:51.322
Give me some water. No, I mustn't.

01:23:51.948 --> 01:23:53.408
It isn't good for my little girl.

01:23:53.575 --> 01:23:55.410
Or let her have a nurse, yes.

01:23:55.952 --> 01:23:58.580
Don't bring her here
because Alexei is coming

01:23:58.663 --> 01:24:00.623
and it will hurt him to see her.

01:24:00.749 --> 01:24:02.917
He's come, my dear. Look there.

01:24:03.418 --> 01:24:05.920
Her deliverance
is still in God's hands.

01:24:06.004 --> 01:24:09.549
You think he won't forgive me
but you don't know him.

01:24:10.383 --> 01:24:12.552
No one knows him except me.

01:24:13.261 --> 01:24:15.388
I'm not afraid of him, now.

01:24:17.807 --> 01:24:19.684
I'm afraid of death, though.

01:24:22.687 --> 01:24:23.772
Oh.

01:24:30.111 --> 01:24:31.571
You poor man.

01:24:35.533 --> 01:24:37.285
Let him come closer.

01:24:39.496 --> 01:24:40.705
Alexei.

01:24:44.125 --> 01:24:45.335
Alexei.

01:24:59.974 --> 01:25:01.434
Look at my husband.

01:25:02.477 --> 01:25:03.937
He's a saint.

01:25:04.979 --> 01:25:06.481
Take his hand.

01:25:22.872 --> 01:25:24.207
Thank God.

01:25:26.126 --> 01:25:27.210
Thank God.

01:25:44.269 --> 01:25:45.979
You must leave now.

01:25:46.896 --> 01:25:49.899
I promise to send for you
if she asks for you.

01:25:51.276 --> 01:25:53.611
I don't know what happened to me.

01:25:53.778 --> 01:25:56.823
I forgive you. I forgive Anna.

01:25:59.409 --> 01:26:01.453
My soul is filled with joy.

01:26:03.288 --> 01:26:06.499
I will remain with her
and look after her forever.

01:26:12.047 --> 01:26:13.340
Come now.

01:26:20.764 --> 01:26:22.015
Come now.

01:26:22.891 --> 01:26:24.309
Look at you.

01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:28.229
You look like what you've become.
A laughingstock.

01:26:29.647 --> 01:26:31.691
I fancy you will be asked
to leave the regiment.

01:26:31.775 --> 01:26:33.276
I would like you to go, <i>Maman.</i>

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.028
I'll go when I'm ready to go.

01:26:35.653 --> 01:26:37.697
A little affair with a married woman

01:26:37.739 --> 01:26:39.616
puts a finishing touch
to a young man's education.

01:26:39.699 --> 01:26:42.202
But this morbid, selfish obsession...

01:26:42.285 --> 01:26:43.703
You've publicly humiliated yourself

01:26:43.745 --> 01:26:45.455
and dishonored
a man who has devoted his life to Russia.

01:26:46.623 --> 01:26:49.542
So you'd better come back
to Moscow with me.

01:26:49.793 --> 01:26:51.503
You're finished here.

01:27:12.107 --> 01:27:16.111
And there was her husband,
wearing her best ball gown.

01:27:16.194 --> 01:27:18.363
Rouge all over his face.

01:27:19.948 --> 01:27:21.825
<i>Ma chÃ¨re, le scandale!</i>

01:27:24.035 --> 01:27:26.955
But I'd better tell you
some regimental news.

01:27:27.288 --> 01:27:28.289
Who is here?

01:27:28.373 --> 01:27:32.627
Princess Elisabeth
Federovna Tverskaya, Your Excellency.

01:27:33.461 --> 01:27:34.963
I don't want to see him.

01:27:35.463 --> 01:27:38.174
But surely your husband wouldn't stop...

01:27:39.175 --> 01:27:40.510
I'm so glad to see you.

01:27:40.593 --> 01:27:41.761
You look feverish.

01:27:41.803 --> 01:27:43.847
We've been talking too much, so I'm going.

01:27:43.930 --> 01:27:45.849
Princess Betsy came to tell me...

01:27:46.975 --> 01:27:48.935
I don't want to hide anything from you.

01:27:49.227 --> 01:27:52.522
Count Vronsky asked
to come to say goodbye. He's going away.

01:27:55.525 --> 01:27:58.153
I've told him that I can't receive him.

01:28:00.989 --> 01:28:02.615
Well, goodbye, my treasure.

01:28:25.764 --> 01:28:27.349
I agree with you.

01:28:27.432 --> 01:28:29.976
As he is going away,
there's no need for Count Vronsky to come.

01:28:30.018 --> 01:28:31.978
I just said so, so there's
no need to repeat it.

01:28:32.062 --> 01:28:33.396
But it is for you to decide.

01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:35.690
Yes, and I decided.

01:28:35.774 --> 01:28:36.816
Then I am very glad that...

01:28:36.858 --> 01:28:39.694
That we agree,
so perhaps we can stop talking about it.

01:28:39.778 --> 01:28:42.697
Of course. Is there
anything I can do for you?

01:28:42.781 --> 01:28:47.452
Yes, can you please, please, please
stop cracking your knuckles?

01:28:53.041 --> 01:28:54.668
I'm a bad woman.

01:28:57.796 --> 01:28:59.547
But I can't breathe.

01:29:01.424 --> 01:29:03.677
Your kindness, which I can't repay,
and your forgiveness...

01:29:03.718 --> 01:29:06.596
You begged me for my forgiveness.

01:29:06.763 --> 01:29:08.431
But I didn't die, and now
I have to live with it.

01:29:08.515 --> 01:29:11.351
Then what? What do you want?

01:29:11.434 --> 01:29:14.688
Do you know what you want?
Do you want to see Count Vronsky?

01:29:14.854 --> 01:29:16.981
Not to say goodbye.

01:29:20.568 --> 01:29:21.986
I can't hear.

01:29:22.946 --> 01:29:24.698
Not to say goodbye.

01:29:27.492 --> 01:29:31.538
You would be lost. Irretrievably lost.

01:29:32.247 --> 01:29:34.207
You would have no position.

01:29:34.290 --> 01:29:37.752
And worse, if we divorce,
you would be the guilty party.

01:29:37.836 --> 01:29:40.422
That means you cannot legally remarry.

01:29:40.505 --> 01:29:43.925
Your union with Count Vronsky
would be illegitimate,

01:29:44.009 --> 01:29:46.594
as would your daughter,
who now has the protection of my name.

01:29:46.678 --> 01:29:48.680
And this is what you want?

01:29:50.557 --> 01:29:54.060
It would be a sin to help
you destroy yourself.

01:29:54.144 --> 01:29:55.937
You forget something.

01:29:57.313 --> 01:30:01.026
Count Vronsky and I love each other.

01:30:02.318 --> 01:30:06.406
And this love sanctifies a criminal folly?

01:30:06.448 --> 01:30:08.283
All I know is that I sent him away

01:30:08.366 --> 01:30:10.869
and it's as if I'd shot
myself through the heart!

01:30:14.914 --> 01:30:16.332
I see.

01:30:20.545 --> 01:30:22.297
And what of Serozha?

01:30:24.716 --> 01:30:26.593
I would die for him,

01:30:27.719 --> 01:30:30.138
but I won't live like this for him.

01:30:31.931 --> 01:30:34.726
When he knows of love, he will forgive me.

01:30:38.772 --> 01:30:41.232
Then I must choose the smaller sin.

01:30:42.108 --> 01:30:45.904
Vronsky has robbed me of my cloak
and I will give him my coat.

01:30:46.154 --> 01:30:47.405
No, I...

01:31:15.308 --> 01:31:17.519
My darling. My darling.

01:31:20.355 --> 01:31:21.481
You look so pale.

01:31:21.523 --> 01:31:23.066
Oh, my darling.

01:31:24.651 --> 01:31:27.487
We'll go south to the
sea air and sunshine.

01:32:32.844 --> 01:32:35.889
Is it all right? Sit down a minute.

01:32:37.015 --> 01:32:39.017
I want to see everything.

01:32:42.645 --> 01:32:43.938
A moment.

01:32:46.733 --> 01:32:48.985
And now I'm doing kitchenmaid's work

01:32:49.069 --> 01:32:51.946
because Nadya's parents
won't let her set foot in the house.

01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:54.616
And who can blame them? It's indecent.

01:33:33.571 --> 01:33:35.281
It's Konstantin.

01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:38.284
Yes, good.

01:33:39.202 --> 01:33:41.287
The doctor here is useless.

01:33:42.205 --> 01:33:44.124
Get me one from Moscow.

01:33:45.625 --> 01:33:47.293
Where did you go?

01:33:48.962 --> 01:33:52.382
I asked for you everywhere
when I was getting married.

01:34:00.473 --> 01:34:02.892
I'm sorry. I couldn't leave him.

01:34:03.309 --> 01:34:05.854
Yes. My wife...

01:34:07.772 --> 01:34:09.482
You can't stay now.

01:34:13.653 --> 01:34:15.822
I will nurse him with Agafia.

01:34:16.781 --> 01:34:18.783
The woman will find
somewhere in the village.

01:34:18.825 --> 01:34:20.535
You won't see her.

01:34:21.327 --> 01:34:23.955
She knows it is impossible to meet you.

01:34:25.248 --> 01:34:27.667
It is a torment to me
that I've brought you under the same roof

01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:30.795
as this unfortunate... As this fallen...

01:34:31.463 --> 01:34:34.174
And in your precious, delicate condition.

01:34:35.884 --> 01:34:37.260
Oh, Kostya.

01:34:40.347 --> 01:34:43.016
Good. A clean nightshirt and sheets.

01:34:43.058 --> 01:34:45.727
A towel and a clean pail of warm water.

01:34:46.394 --> 01:34:47.437
Wait.

01:34:52.692 --> 01:34:53.735
And bring the perfume bottle,

01:34:54.444 --> 01:34:56.988
in the outside pocket of my handbag.

01:36:14.232 --> 01:36:18.278
Twenty-one to Stremov, four to Karenin.
The motion is carried.

01:36:37.714 --> 01:36:39.799
Alexei, they're back.

01:36:40.633 --> 01:36:42.635
Here, in St. Petersburg.

01:36:43.261 --> 01:36:44.846
She has written to me.

01:36:45.722 --> 01:36:46.806
To you?

01:36:58.151 --> 01:37:01.071
They think I don't have
the right to refuse.

01:37:01.821 --> 01:37:02.989
It's the boy's birthday.

01:37:03.656 --> 01:37:05.075
My friend,

01:37:07.243 --> 01:37:11.122
you would be blowing on the embers
of a fire which must be allowed to die.

01:37:13.667 --> 01:37:15.168
Let me write to her.

01:38:00.338 --> 01:38:02.298
I'm here to see Serozha.

01:38:04.551 --> 01:38:05.719
<i>Madame?</i>

01:38:10.015 --> 01:38:12.434
I beg your pardon, Your Excellency.

01:38:17.022 --> 01:38:19.149
No, I've come to see Serozha.

01:38:37.751 --> 01:38:39.461
Serozha.

01:38:39.794 --> 01:38:40.962
<i>Maman?</i>

01:38:41.087 --> 01:38:42.130
Oh.

01:38:42.756 --> 01:38:44.090
My dear little boy.

01:38:44.174 --> 01:38:46.051
I knew you would come.

01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:48.053
Today is my birthday.

01:38:48.094 --> 01:38:49.596
I know.

01:38:50.263 --> 01:38:52.015
Are you crying?

01:38:52.098 --> 01:38:53.266
No, I won't cry.

01:38:54.059 --> 01:38:55.393
Where did you go, <i>Maman?</i>

01:38:55.435 --> 01:38:57.187
I don't know.

01:38:57.395 --> 01:38:59.314
Everywhere. The south.

01:39:00.774 --> 01:39:02.942
I thought about you every day.

01:39:03.777 --> 01:39:06.613
And I thought about you every day.

01:39:09.074 --> 01:39:11.743
And you must love <i>Papa.</i>
He's better than I am.

01:39:11.785 --> 01:39:14.746
No one in the whole world
is better than you.

01:39:32.931 --> 01:39:33.973
No.

01:40:09.009 --> 01:40:10.301
Where's Anya?

01:40:10.343 --> 01:40:12.095
She's still asleep.

01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:15.640
Should I take your coat?

01:40:18.935 --> 01:40:20.854
Are you feeling unwell, madam?

01:40:20.937 --> 01:40:22.564
I'm not sleeping.

01:40:23.231 --> 01:40:25.358
I can send out for something.

01:40:26.109 --> 01:40:27.193
Yes.

01:40:49.424 --> 01:40:51.384
Why are you in the dark?

01:40:51.843 --> 01:40:54.679
Yashvin is going to call.
You remember him.

01:40:55.055 --> 01:40:56.097
Are you going out?

01:40:56.681 --> 01:40:57.974
To where?

01:40:59.184 --> 01:41:00.393
To whom?

01:41:00.727 --> 01:41:02.395
What's the matter?

01:41:03.396 --> 01:41:04.773
I didn't know what happened to you.

01:41:04.856 --> 01:41:06.358
But I told you yesterday. My brother.

01:41:06.399 --> 01:41:09.235
Does it take all day to meet your brother?

01:41:09.486 --> 01:41:11.571
Does he need you more than I do?

01:41:11.988 --> 01:41:13.448
What's happened?

01:41:17.660 --> 01:41:19.871
Well, Alexander agreed to everything.

01:41:19.913 --> 01:41:21.623
Mother's house in Moscow will go to him,

01:41:21.706 --> 01:41:24.626
and the country estate
will be our new home.

01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:29.339
As soon as the divorce.

01:41:30.799 --> 01:41:33.510
Karenin hasn't answered your letter yet?

01:41:38.264 --> 01:41:40.684
You're the very first
person to call on me since our return.

01:41:40.767 --> 01:41:43.061
I received a note from Princess Betsy

01:41:43.103 --> 01:41:46.064
asking me to call on her
between 6:30 and 8:00.

01:41:46.106 --> 01:41:47.774
Or was it 7:00?

01:41:48.108 --> 01:41:50.652
But perhaps you'll meet
at the opera tonight.

01:41:50.735 --> 01:41:52.696
I would love to be there
if I could get a box.

01:41:52.946 --> 01:41:54.572
<i>Madame, </i> your box is number four.

01:41:55.115 --> 01:41:57.617
You'll find me there
with Princess Myagkaya.

01:41:58.618 --> 01:41:59.786
Will you come, Vronsky?

01:42:04.124 --> 01:42:06.918
- Well...
- I see why Alexei is so fond of you.

01:42:14.384 --> 01:42:16.011
You know you can't go to the theater.

01:42:16.094 --> 01:42:17.846
- Annushka!
- For heaven's sake.

01:42:17.929 --> 01:42:19.305
A bath! I'll come in and choose a dress.

01:42:19.347 --> 01:42:20.473
Anna, I implore you.

01:42:20.515 --> 01:42:22.934
I'm not ashamed of who I am
or what I've done.

01:42:22.976 --> 01:42:24.728
Are you ashamed for me?

01:42:24.894 --> 01:42:27.522
Why don't you book a room at the hotel?

01:42:27.605 --> 01:42:29.315
Aren't we together?

01:42:30.108 --> 01:42:31.151
Have you changed towards me?

01:42:31.234 --> 01:42:32.736
It's because I love you
and care about you.

01:42:32.819 --> 01:42:35.155
If that's the case, then I don't know why
you aren't coming with me.

01:42:35.238 --> 01:42:37.323
- That would make it worse.
- You're afraid.

01:42:37.699 --> 01:42:39.200
Well, I'm not.

01:43:18.031 --> 01:43:20.200
Should we visit, or stay put?

01:43:20.825 --> 01:43:22.077
Stay put.

01:43:24.662 --> 01:43:27.123
Minister! Congratulations.

01:43:27.791 --> 01:43:29.584
Come in for a moment.

01:43:49.187 --> 01:43:51.439
Princess Sorokina and her daughter.

01:43:51.523 --> 01:43:54.859
They're from Moscow,
neighbors of Count Vronsky's mother.

01:43:55.068 --> 01:43:58.446
Quite well off. No sons. She's a widow.

01:44:00.782 --> 01:44:02.784
My dear, I'm a sales catalog.

01:44:11.126 --> 01:44:12.335
Alexei.

01:44:14.963 --> 01:44:17.465
You'll come up to see us afterwards?

01:44:17.924 --> 01:44:19.676
I'll talk to Varya.

01:44:23.805 --> 01:44:25.140
Will you call on Anna?

01:44:25.265 --> 01:44:28.768
Oh. Alexei. I'm fond of...

01:44:28.810 --> 01:44:29.853
For God's sake!

01:44:32.272 --> 01:44:33.314
Anna isn't a criminal.

01:44:33.398 --> 01:44:36.317
I'd call on her if she'd
only broken the law.

01:44:37.068 --> 01:44:39.029
But she broke the rules.

01:44:54.377 --> 01:44:57.630
Who has made
the dÃ©cor? Haven't we got a program?

01:44:57.922 --> 01:44:59.466
Colonel, would you be so kind?

01:44:59.549 --> 01:45:00.633
Of course.

01:45:00.675 --> 01:45:04.262
Please, I would be honored
if you would take mine.

01:45:04.471 --> 01:45:06.306
Thank you. How very...

01:45:08.975 --> 01:45:10.018
It's a disgrace.

01:45:10.101 --> 01:45:11.478
Hush, dear. A common courtesy.

01:45:16.358 --> 01:45:18.068
Everyone's looking.

01:45:18.151 --> 01:45:20.987
Let them look! Fetch my cloak.

01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:23.656
What are we coming to?

01:45:23.948 --> 01:45:26.826
It's an insult to decency. Take me home.

01:45:26.868 --> 01:45:30.330
Hush. I beg you, my dear.
It was only a word or two.

01:45:30.538 --> 01:45:31.998
I have a word or two for some people

01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:33.875
one didn't expect
to be rubbing shoulders with.

01:45:35.001 --> 01:45:38.546
She has a nerve,
flaunting herself like a slut in society.

01:45:42.842 --> 01:45:44.219
Yes, why don't you?

01:45:44.302 --> 01:45:46.638
Rescue her and put your
seal on the fiasco.

01:46:02.237 --> 01:46:03.571
Alexei,

01:46:04.072 --> 01:46:06.032
you see why she must divorce.

01:46:06.991 --> 01:46:10.370
Marriage will solve everything.
When will it be?

01:46:10.412 --> 01:46:12.455
As far as I'm concerned, she's my wife.

01:46:12.539 --> 01:46:14.541
As you saw, she isn't.

01:46:16.793 --> 01:46:18.461
We're going to Moscow,
then to my place in the country.

01:46:19.045 --> 01:46:20.547
That sounds like a good idea.

01:46:20.714 --> 01:46:22.298
But, for a day or two,
Anna will be at home.

01:46:24.718 --> 01:46:25.760
Then...

01:46:27.637 --> 01:46:29.431
I'll say goodbye now.

01:46:49.242 --> 01:46:51.578
Well, you had an excellent night.

01:46:53.621 --> 01:46:56.207
Does your mother want you
to marry the widow or the child?

01:46:57.083 --> 01:46:59.252
- Either one.
- Don't joke about it.

01:46:59.336 --> 01:47:03.131
If you loved me, you would have locked me
in to stop me going!

01:47:19.064 --> 01:47:20.857
Yes, it was my fault.

01:47:34.329 --> 01:47:35.830
I won't sleep.

01:47:39.793 --> 01:47:41.920
I know how to make you sleep.

01:48:36.725 --> 01:48:39.978
Anna, I am very glad to see you.

01:48:40.353 --> 01:48:42.689
Are you well? How is your little one?

01:48:44.524 --> 01:48:47.610
Stiva wanted to invite you
and Count Vronsky to the house,

01:48:47.694 --> 01:48:49.279
but it's impossible.

01:48:49.362 --> 01:48:50.864
No, I understand.

01:48:50.947 --> 01:48:52.866
No. No, you don't.

01:48:53.742 --> 01:48:55.869
Kitty and her husband are with us.

01:48:55.952 --> 01:48:57.871
She's in Moscow to have the baby.

01:48:57.912 --> 01:49:01.207
Kitty! Tell her how pleased I am.

01:49:01.916 --> 01:49:04.210
Perhaps I'll wait a year or two.

01:49:06.171 --> 01:49:07.213
Love.

01:49:09.090 --> 01:49:10.425
Yes, love.

01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:17.891
Don't you disapprove of me
for what I've done?

01:49:18.433 --> 01:49:21.561
No. I wish I'd done the same.

01:49:22.062 --> 01:49:23.813
But no one asked me.

01:49:25.148 --> 01:49:28.651
Well, I wouldn't have been brave enough.

01:49:30.153 --> 01:49:31.988
Stiva, you know,

01:49:32.614 --> 01:49:34.282
he doesn't change.

01:49:35.408 --> 01:49:37.369
Like all men, I suppose.

01:50:38.888 --> 01:50:40.473
I had an inspiration.

01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:41.850
Why do we have to wait here?

01:50:41.933 --> 01:50:43.727
Why can't we wait in the country?

01:50:43.810 --> 01:50:46.062
I don't want to hear any more about
a divorce or think about it.

01:50:46.146 --> 01:50:47.772
Good, I'm bored here. When should we go?

01:50:48.231 --> 01:50:50.150
If I bore you here, I'll
bore you in the country.

01:50:50.316 --> 01:50:52.861
I didn't say you bore me, Moscow bores
me. When should we go? Tomorrow?

01:50:53.236 --> 01:50:54.571
I can't be ready by tomorrow.

01:50:54.654 --> 01:50:55.822
- The day after, then.
- If you like.

01:50:55.905 --> 01:50:58.825
No, wait, that's Sunday.
I have to see <i>Maman.</i>

01:50:59.159 --> 01:51:00.493
That's 20 minutes away on the train.

01:51:00.994 --> 01:51:02.829
You could go to see her tomorrow.

01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:06.833
Or was it that you wanted
to spend Sunday with Princess Sorokina?

01:51:07.083 --> 01:51:09.336
Please. Don't spoil everything.

01:51:09.836 --> 01:51:11.171
I can't see <i>Maman </i> tomorrow

01:51:11.212 --> 01:51:12.756
because she won't have
read the papers she has to sign.

01:51:13.381 --> 01:51:15.050
In that case, let's not bother.

01:51:15.133 --> 01:51:17.010
- I'll leave on Sunday or not at all.
- That's absurd.

01:51:17.093 --> 01:51:19.846
It's absurd to you because you have
no understanding of my life here.

01:51:20.388 --> 01:51:22.766
- Anna.
- No, you've stopped loving me.

01:51:23.516 --> 01:51:26.144
You've given up everything for me
and it's turned you against me.

01:51:26.269 --> 01:51:28.021
- Why lie about it?
- Stop!

01:51:28.104 --> 01:51:30.690
I put off our departure for a day or two
and you tell me I don't love you.

01:51:31.066 --> 01:51:32.942
Because I've been living off your love
and there's none left.

01:51:33.026 --> 01:51:34.110
So this is over. Finished.

01:51:48.208 --> 01:51:49.542
I'm sorry.

01:51:59.594 --> 01:52:00.929
I don't mind when we go.

01:52:01.012 --> 01:52:03.223
I'll telegraph <i>Maman. </i> We'll go on Sunday.

01:52:03.556 --> 01:52:05.183
I'll do anything you want.

01:52:05.308 --> 01:52:08.395
- You should leave me.
- I don't want to. I love you.

01:52:09.104 --> 01:52:10.188
Why?

01:52:11.398 --> 01:52:14.401
You can't ask "why" about love.

01:52:40.468 --> 01:52:42.595
So, will you be all packed?

01:52:43.263 --> 01:52:45.390
I'll be out today making the arrangements.

01:52:45.432 --> 01:52:47.267
Is that your way of telling me
you'll be at your mother's

01:52:47.308 --> 01:52:48.643
with that simpering little princess?

01:52:48.727 --> 01:52:51.604
No. I'll be at my lawyer's,
waiting for some documents.

01:52:51.646 --> 01:52:53.565
Then I'm having dinner
to say goodbye to old comrades.

01:52:53.606 --> 01:52:54.649
I know what that means.

01:52:54.733 --> 01:52:57.235
My God, this is unendurable!

01:52:59.112 --> 01:53:00.363
I can invite them here, if you like.

01:53:00.447 --> 01:53:03.283
Thank you, but if I'm not fit to dine
in society, I won't eat with the band.

01:53:03.324 --> 01:53:06.953
Who was the telegram from?

01:53:07.370 --> 01:53:10.123
I didn't show you because Stiva keeps
telegraphing what we already know.

01:53:10.165 --> 01:53:11.791
Karenin promises nothing,
but will consider...

01:53:11.875 --> 01:53:14.961
I told you I don't care about the divorce,
so why hide the telegram?

01:53:25.722 --> 01:53:28.433
Is there anything you wish to say to me?

01:54:03.051 --> 01:54:04.719
So it's the child.

01:54:05.512 --> 01:54:07.013
She brought papers from <i>Maman.</i>

01:54:12.185 --> 01:54:13.269
Anna.

01:54:33.373 --> 01:54:34.374
No.

01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:09.547
Oh, God.

01:58:09.714 --> 01:58:10.882
Forgive me.

01:58:48.837 --> 01:58:51.715
I'll be buying in feed
before winter's over.

01:58:51.798 --> 01:58:55.343
Well, you don't press people hard,
but you live rightly.

01:58:56.177 --> 01:58:58.722
For your soul, not your belly.

01:59:01.599 --> 01:59:03.351
How do we know what's rightly?

01:59:03.685 --> 01:59:06.021
Just by knowing it. How else?

01:59:06.813 --> 01:59:10.066
But I believe in reason.

01:59:10.525 --> 01:59:13.820
Reason. Was it reason
that made you choose your wife?

01:59:41.014 --> 01:59:42.932
I came looking for you.

01:59:45.352 --> 01:59:46.978
I understood something.

01:59:47.312 --> 01:59:49.272
What did you understand?

02:00:02.535 --> 02:00:04.162
He smiled at me.

02:00:04.329 --> 02:00:06.539
He's very advanced for his age.

02:00:09.542 --> 02:00:11.503
What did you understand?

02:00:28.770 --> 02:00:30.689
I'm so proud of you.

02:00:30.730 --> 02:00:32.399
Night-night.

02:00:46.996 --> 02:00:48.081
And you, too.

02:00:48.123 --> 02:00:50.667
Good night, my darling boy.

02:01:11.271 --> 02:01:12.772
Anya!

02:01:14.107 --> 02:01:15.442
Anya!

02:01:17.736 --> 02:01:18.536
Anya!

02:01:19.305 --> 02:01:25.770
