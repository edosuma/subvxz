00:28.612 --> 00:29.655
I'm sorry.

00:30.531 --> 00:35.410
But this has to be done.
With your sacrifice,

00:36.370 --> 00:39.373
our grand plan will become reality.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.834
Don't look at me like that.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.587
I need to go, so--

00:54.429 --> 00:55.264
You awake?

01:03.397 --> 01:06.108
What the hell, man? This isn't funny!

01:06.858 --> 01:09.444
I'm sorry. But this has to be done.

01:09.987 --> 01:14.449
With your sacrifice,
our grand plan will become reality.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.618
So...

01:18.453 --> 01:20.163
I hope you can forgive me,

01:20.539 --> 01:22.040
Mr. Yellow.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.254
Y-You planned this all along?

01:29.172 --> 01:31.466
No fair, let me be part...

01:32.175 --> 01:34.511
of the plan.

01:35.679 --> 01:36.513
Let me...

01:45.147 --> 01:48.317
First period, science experiment complete!

01:48.692 --> 01:51.069
Second period... That's Morals class!

01:52.362 --> 01:54.906
-I feel so sorry for him!
-I feel so sorry for him!

02:28.732 --> 02:31.234
That was great!

02:32.319 --> 02:36.323
You should've become a violinist,
not a craftsman here at our shop!

02:37.783 --> 02:40.160
I like fixing them better.

02:41.078 --> 02:42.079
You do?

02:42.454 --> 02:45.874
To my ears,
you play better than most pros!

02:46.750 --> 02:48.085
Only because of this.

02:49.044 --> 02:51.046
Yeah, that's a Gagliano.

02:51.963 --> 02:54.716
This was made 300 years ago, wasn't it?

02:55.175 --> 02:58.762
And it wasn't just locked away someplace,
but lovingly used

02:59.596 --> 03:02.557
and kept in good repair,
handed down over the years.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.729
I think that's a really amazing thing.

03:09.106 --> 03:12.067
Yeah. If you think about it like that,
it is amazing.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.069
How come he's teaching you?

03:14.778 --> 03:17.322
We take a living thing and mend it

03:17.406 --> 03:20.700
so it can be passed down
for another 300 years.

03:21.785 --> 03:24.329
It's like the best job in the world.

03:26.289 --> 03:29.459
Even if I die, part of me will live on.

03:30.127 --> 03:34.423
Bravo! Well said! You understand deep down
what it is to be a true craftsman!

03:34.631 --> 03:38.009
Unlike my fool of a daughter
who chose to be a detective!

03:38.093 --> 03:40.178
As my only son, you're my pride!

03:40.345 --> 03:41.847
Um, I'm your son, Dad.

03:42.514 --> 03:43.598
You're dead to me!

03:45.308 --> 03:49.813
Market Maker, a mysterious group
that orchestrates crimes and even wars.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.691
Under the orders of the royal family,

03:52.774 --> 03:55.819
they carry out secret activities,
assassinations, sabotage and infiltration.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.779
No individuals, just a collective name.

03:58.405 --> 04:03.744
Its members' right hands are marked
with a skull, although no one's seen it.

04:04.911 --> 04:08.582
It's a mysterious organization
that's gone largely unnoticed in history.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.876
Is this for real, Kaela?

04:11.752 --> 04:13.211
Hey, wait a minute...

04:13.670 --> 04:19.301
you better not have asked me over here
just to show me this lame, bogus article.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.679
Let's go to the crime scene, Bran.

04:28.310 --> 04:32.564
ASSEMBLYMAN ED KYLE, PERSONAL RESIDENCE

04:32.773 --> 04:34.357
There's little trace evidence.

04:34.441 --> 04:35.317
And over there?

04:35.567 --> 04:37.152
Mostly wiped down.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.156
-Where's the Chief?
-He went upstairs a minute ago.

04:41.239 --> 04:42.073
Okay.

04:44.868 --> 04:46.411
What are you doing?

04:46.495 --> 04:49.122
You can't let a civilian
into a crime scene!

04:49.664 --> 04:52.292
No, ma'am. This is-- Er, sir?

04:52.959 --> 04:55.837
Hey. You're doing that on purpose,
aren't you?

04:56.338 --> 04:57.214
Hey.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.636
Finally back to your old self, I see!

05:07.766 --> 05:11.019
The murdered assemblyman
was always involved in a scandal.

05:12.354 --> 05:17.359
He was all over the news recently because
of illegal donations from corporations.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.278
That must be why he was targeted.

05:20.946 --> 05:23.865
The arrogant misguided vigilante
scumbag pal again, huh?

05:24.407 --> 05:26.368
Who would do such a thing?

05:26.868 --> 05:29.663
He didn't have to kill the man's family,
too!

05:31.039 --> 05:32.207
It's "arrogant" now?

05:32.833 --> 05:33.667
HESITATION?

05:33.750 --> 05:36.211
It won't stick cause you keep changing it.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.547
-It was different?
-You can't tell?

05:42.050 --> 05:45.428
What's the matter?
Are you feeling sick or something?

05:45.679 --> 05:47.931
This case doesn't involve Killer B.

05:49.307 --> 05:53.562
What are you basing that on?
His usual mark is right there.

05:53.979 --> 05:56.731
Keith, what makes you think it wasn't him?

05:58.149 --> 05:59.025
It's sloppy.

05:59.484 --> 06:04.030
-Can you explain it to us in simple terms?
-The angles aren't naive.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.533
What is he talking about?

06:06.658 --> 06:09.369
Genie-isms. Basically, I have no idea.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.582
Eric, come here a minute.
There's something you should see.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.096
Don't get any closer.

06:29.598 --> 06:31.808
Keith, could this be...

06:33.435 --> 06:34.269
Yeah.

06:40.442 --> 06:41.568
This is troublesome.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.779
That it is.

06:45.363 --> 06:49.117
The body in there is definitely dead
as the result of poison gas.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.871
Plus, I'm seeing symptoms
of both nerve gas and a blistering agent.

06:55.665 --> 06:59.961
The killer must've created a gas
that combines the properties of each.

07:00.045 --> 07:04.299
It's not as fast-acting as nerve gas,
but not as slow as a blistering agent.

07:05.383 --> 07:08.011
Whoever made that stuff is really twisted.

07:09.179 --> 07:14.059
It's clear the killer wants his victims
to suffer horribly before he kills them.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.315
So, what's the countermeasure?

07:20.482 --> 07:22.359
Simply put, there isn't one.

07:23.944 --> 07:27.948
If this were an existing gas,
there would be some way to counteract it,

07:28.031 --> 07:30.450
but this is something new,
with refinements added.

07:31.201 --> 07:34.621
I've asked the Army Institute of Medicine
for assistance,

07:34.704 --> 07:38.959
but there's no telling when we'll come up
with an effective counteragent.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.962
In any case, I can't make it here.

07:42.587 --> 07:47.258
It will be better than nothing, but
all I can do is prepare a preventative.

07:48.218 --> 07:49.761
-Will it work?
-No idea.

07:50.637 --> 07:51.680
Come on.

07:52.097 --> 07:55.684
How can I know if something will work
if I haven't made it yet?

07:55.767 --> 07:57.727
Or would you rather hear the odds?

07:58.979 --> 08:02.941
Not today. If you told me the odds,
I'd probably lose all hope.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.444
Personally, I think it's a miracle
that it's not zero.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.490
Spoken like a doctor, same as always.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.075
If you don't like it,

08:12.158 --> 08:16.454
tell Eric to catch the criminal
before he can use the gas.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.373
Roger that, Doctor.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.167
Genie.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.212
Are you still searching?

08:25.338 --> 08:26.715
It's been seven years.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.509
Have you learned anything yet?

08:30.844 --> 08:32.095
I still don't know.

08:32.554 --> 08:33.388
Then why?

08:34.889 --> 08:38.684
But I have found a clue
that will lead me to the killer.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.820
This is an invitation

08:49.070 --> 08:52.866
to a charity party sent by the mayor
to the murdered assemblyman.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.994
A warning he's going to hit the place,
huh?

08:56.077 --> 08:57.579
Any chance it's a bluff?

08:58.204 --> 09:01.041
When we examined the box
left beside the corpse,

09:01.499 --> 09:03.293
albeit a small amount,

09:03.376 --> 09:06.755
we detected real poison gas
in the container inside.

09:07.213 --> 09:10.925
According to the Royal Institute
of Forensic Medicine's report,

09:11.176 --> 09:14.220
it's something new,
and it's highly lethal.

09:14.929 --> 09:18.183
If they release something like that
at a party...

09:18.516 --> 09:20.393
It'll affect the entire region.

09:21.519 --> 09:25.190
Depending on weather conditions,
we're looking at millions of deaths.

09:25.690 --> 09:30.153
Where did the perp get his hands
on such a nasty gas, anyway?

09:30.904 --> 09:34.115
It's not like
you can just buy it anywhere.

09:34.741 --> 09:39.204
The victim found in the attic
is Ian Reyes. Age, 42. Male.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.582
He was senior researcher
at Premio Farmacia.

09:43.083 --> 09:47.587
However, he's been missing for six months.
His family even filed a report.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.173
So this guy definitely made the gas.

09:50.256 --> 09:53.134
We don't know if it was voluntary
or not, though.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.804
He was eliminated
after he was no longer useful?

09:55.887 --> 09:58.765
Jonathan, look into Ian Reyes
and his associates.

09:59.516 --> 10:00.350
Roger that.

10:00.558 --> 10:04.062
Kaela, contact the relevant ministries
and research agencies.

10:04.145 --> 10:07.482
Find out if materials or equipment
used to make poison gas

10:07.565 --> 10:10.026
-have been reported stolen or missing.
-Yes, sir.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.404
Mario and the rest, go to tonight's venue.

10:13.863 --> 10:17.909
Check out suspicious people or objects.
Put together a plan to provide security.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.912
Also, to avoid unnecessary panic,

10:21.079 --> 10:24.290
we've been told to keep word of the gas
from the public.

10:25.542 --> 10:29.546
I'm not sure if it's even possible
to cover a building this big.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.507
Um, what if this doesn't work?

10:32.924 --> 10:36.261
There are no what-ifs.
If there's no way, we make one.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.263
That's our job.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.209
<i>And now, today's news.</i>

11:09.377 --> 11:13.840
<i>The Royal Police have concluded
<i>that the murders yesterday morning</i></i>

11:14.549 --> 11:19.178
<i>of Assemblyman Ed Kyle and his family
<i>in their home were the work of Killer B.</i></i>

11:20.013 --> 11:23.808
<i>An investigation is underway
<i>to learn how the crimes are connected.</i></i>

11:24.767 --> 11:26.811
-Ow!
-What happened?

11:27.270 --> 11:29.814
I'm sorry, I nicked myself.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.190
Are you okay?

11:31.691 --> 11:33.401
Wow, it looks pretty deep!

11:34.319 --> 11:37.071
But it doesn't hurt all that much.

11:38.573 --> 11:39.866
There.

11:43.119 --> 11:47.373
That's a lot of blood.
Have Mother drive you to the hospital.

11:47.457 --> 11:48.833
Honest, I'm fine.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.795
Then go. You don't have to come back.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.173
What? Why are you saying it so coldly?

11:55.256 --> 11:56.883
I didn't mean anything by it!

11:56.966 --> 11:59.260
-You're such an obnoxious old fart!
-What?

11:59.344 --> 12:01.054
-I'll be going.
-So obnoxious!

12:01.137 --> 12:01.971
Shut up!

12:02.680 --> 12:06.976
LEGACY PALACE

12:08.561 --> 12:11.773
CHARITY BALL VENUE

12:18.696 --> 12:21.282
<i>-No eating, Lily.
-I won't.</i>

12:21.532 --> 12:23.868
<i>-It sounds like it.
<i>-It's physiological.</i></i>

12:23.952 --> 12:25.244
ZEPPOLE DI SAN GIUSEPPE

12:25.662 --> 12:27.705
Don't use that excuse for everything!

12:28.164 --> 12:29.415
Instinct, then.

12:29.624 --> 12:33.127
<i>I'm telling you to do something
<i>about those "instincts."</i></i>

12:33.753 --> 12:37.382
<i>Over a mic, that doesn't sound like
<i>any noise a human would make!</i></i>

12:37.632 --> 12:38.841
<i>It's a distraction!</i>

12:39.884 --> 12:41.469
My mic's in a bad location.

13:18.715 --> 13:21.134
-What is that?
<i>-An oiran.</i>

13:21.551 --> 13:23.553
That's a classical Japanese outfit.

13:23.803 --> 13:28.016
And if that outfit is authentic,
it costs about the same as a Cayenne.

13:28.099 --> 13:29.684
<i>Whoa!</i>

13:29.892 --> 13:32.895
Though to be honest,
I'd take a Hummer over a Cayenne.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.983
Synchronization complete. We have eyes.

13:38.985 --> 13:42.447
This is a program that tracks
and analyzes the action curves

13:42.697 --> 13:44.365
of people moving in a crowd.

13:46.534 --> 13:50.496
If someone moves against the flow
of traffic or moves abruptly,

13:50.830 --> 13:53.499
it can flag them as suspicious
and track them.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.127
Can it make split-second decisions?

13:56.210 --> 13:57.045
It can.

13:58.379 --> 14:02.425
I'm giving you command of the venue.
Do whatever it takes to stop this.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.179
All personnel, report!

14:07.263 --> 14:09.057
Area one, all clear on this end.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.517
Area two, all clear here, too.

14:11.976 --> 14:12.977
Ditto.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.361
<i>Keith, Boris, what's your status?</i>

14:30.745 --> 14:32.205
Building front entrance.

14:32.288 --> 14:35.291
Aside from Keith Flick,
nothing abnormal to report.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.002
All search teams,

14:38.336 --> 14:39.420
what's your status?

14:39.504 --> 14:41.172
<i>Area 15, all clear.</i>

14:41.714 --> 14:44.467
<i>Area 16,
<i>no sign of anything here yet, either.</i></i>

14:45.635 --> 14:47.387
Area 20, all clear.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.431
Area 22, all clear.

14:51.891 --> 14:55.770
Area 24, no sign of any suspicious people
or packages.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.733
Area 27, all clear.

15:01.192 --> 15:03.611
<i>Understood. Continue your search.</i>

15:04.529 --> 15:06.197
<i>Don't overlook anything.</i>

15:06.823 --> 15:09.450
<i>The gas ought to be near the HVAC system.</i>

15:11.577 --> 15:13.454
How perceptive of you.

15:35.643 --> 15:36.477
Excuse me.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.165
Suspicious person detected!

15:57.707 --> 15:59.083
<i>Venue area 12!</i>

15:59.167 --> 16:02.503
<i>Male, blond hair! The slender waiter!
<i>Heading towards the mayor!</i></i>

16:19.353 --> 16:20.521
Suspect apprehended!

16:21.939 --> 16:24.484
-Are you all right?
-Y-Yes.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.445
This man is unharmed, too.

16:28.112 --> 16:31.157
Coming with as crude a weapon as a knife,
huh?

16:31.908 --> 16:33.826
Weren't you going to use "it"?

16:35.620 --> 16:38.706
I was worried sick
you weren't going to come.

16:39.874 --> 16:43.127
But now we can begin fifth period
exactly as planned!

16:43.628 --> 16:47.590
How stupid are you? It's all over.
There never was any gas, was there?

16:48.591 --> 16:51.719
Fifth period will prove it
when it begins in a minute!

16:51.969 --> 16:54.597
I'll make it a fun after-school activity!

16:54.680 --> 16:55.681
Blue!

16:55.973 --> 16:57.266
<i>Drop the birdcage!</i>

16:58.726 --> 16:59.936
It's about damn time!

17:00.478 --> 17:01.938
The wagtails are flying.

17:15.451 --> 17:16.953
HQ! Come in!

17:17.244 --> 17:19.163
This is the front entrance! HQ!

17:21.290 --> 17:22.875
It's no use, it won't open.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.461
No luck over here, either!

17:27.046 --> 17:28.798
This one won't open, either.

17:29.507 --> 17:32.176
<i>Mario, every way in and out
<i>has been sealed off.</i></i>

17:32.718 --> 17:34.637
<i>We're completely locked in.</i>

17:35.555 --> 17:37.014
What's your game?

17:37.723 --> 17:40.893
We have control of the hotel's systems!

17:41.060 --> 17:43.729
You can't get out of here!

17:45.147 --> 17:46.691
-Kaela?
<i>-He's right.</i>

17:46.983 --> 17:49.151
I can't access the building's systems!

17:49.318 --> 17:50.903
I'm being repelled!

17:52.321 --> 17:54.824
The wagtails have all been caught!

17:55.783 --> 17:58.286
We've rigged this building
with poison gas!

17:58.536 --> 18:03.749
Enough to kill not only everyone here,
but everyone in the whole city!

18:04.458 --> 18:08.838
The instant the clock strikes 9:00,
your lives will end!

18:10.047 --> 18:13.676
If you want me to disable it,
someone here will have to...

18:14.218 --> 18:16.846
kill the mayor standing right there!

18:17.305 --> 18:20.891
Do that, and the device will stop.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.189
If you don't believe me, fine.

18:27.565 --> 18:29.859
Come 9:00, you'll know for sure.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.987
And then, everyone will end up like this!

18:35.406 --> 18:40.494
<i>No fair, let me be part... of the plan.</i>

18:41.829 --> 18:42.830
<i>Let me...</i>

18:50.212 --> 18:51.964
Everyone, please remain calm!

18:52.256 --> 18:53.799
No pushing, I said!

18:54.592 --> 18:58.179
Hey, who just felt me up?
You're under arrest!

18:59.221 --> 19:00.306
You'll die, too!

19:01.015 --> 19:03.142
Kill the mayor yourself, then!

19:03.601 --> 19:06.395
Do that and it will save everyone!

19:07.521 --> 19:08.773
You're a nutjob.

19:09.357 --> 19:14.612
<i>Listen, everyone here will die,
<i>me included! An epic tragedy!</i></i>

19:15.154 --> 19:18.699
<i>Tonight will be spoken of with terror
<i>for all time!</i></i>

19:19.241 --> 19:24.246
<i>But the names of you victims will crumble
<i>into dust and fade away into oblivion!</i></i>

19:25.039 --> 19:28.542
In other words, the only name
future generations will remember

19:28.626 --> 19:30.127
will be mine, the attacker!

19:31.754 --> 19:33.047
Only mine!

19:34.173 --> 19:35.341
Why, you...

19:35.883 --> 19:39.970
Before long, my name will race around
the wilderness that is information

19:40.054 --> 19:41.222
and become a legend!

19:42.515 --> 19:44.392
How's this sound as the headline?

19:45.101 --> 19:48.104
"A Young Boy's Beautiful Despair"?

19:49.021 --> 19:50.439
You psycho freak.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.193
Does that make you angry,
Mr. Nameless Detective?

19:54.652 --> 19:56.696
All for a pathetic notion like that?

19:56.779 --> 20:01.784
That pathetic notion is going to beat you!
I feel sorry for you! Who are you?

20:03.661 --> 20:07.123
I'll make sure everyone remembers.
Your stupid face and name!

20:07.832 --> 20:11.419
As a dumbass criminal who was a failure!

20:12.002 --> 20:12.837
Kaela!

20:13.295 --> 20:16.549
I was listening!
I'm pissed, too, so be quiet for a bit!

20:16.841 --> 20:19.552
Cocky punks piss me off
worse than cockroaches!

20:19.844 --> 20:23.013
<i>Punks who do nothing
<i>but whine about society piss me off!</i></i>

20:23.097 --> 20:24.056
<i>-Besides--
-Kaela.</i>

20:24.473 --> 20:25.933
I said shut up!

20:26.809 --> 20:28.686
Fine, whatever.

20:29.854 --> 20:32.982
Sounds like you guys
made our big sister angry.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.317
Don't come crying to me.

20:36.652 --> 20:40.448
This is more complex than I thought.
They're not so dumb after all?

20:41.490 --> 20:43.492
But that doesn't mean they're smart.

20:59.425 --> 21:00.968
So you came after all.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.808
Bull's-eye, and right on the money.

21:07.892 --> 21:11.270
I wasn't expecting you to swallow
that cheap bait so easily.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.231
Maybe that person is amazing after all.

21:14.482 --> 21:17.777
Right, you don't know who I mean
by "that person," do you?

21:18.569 --> 21:21.363
Are you curious?
You're curious, aren't you?

21:22.281 --> 21:24.492
But I won't tell you just yet.

21:26.076 --> 21:29.497
I would take you to them
if you agreed to come willingly,

21:29.580 --> 21:31.874
but that's not what you want, is it?

21:34.126 --> 21:35.878
Oh, I'm so scared!

21:37.129 --> 21:41.383
Are you planning to use that
to destroy me like you did Quinn?

21:43.135 --> 21:44.595
Quinn died,

21:45.471 --> 21:47.223
but I don't think I will.

21:47.973 --> 21:51.477
I'm kinda fast. Just a little bit.

21:52.937 --> 21:55.064
What we need is you.

21:55.898 --> 21:57.942
But not your life.

21:59.777 --> 22:01.946
Do you understand what this means?

22:13.499 --> 22:14.542
Who are you?
