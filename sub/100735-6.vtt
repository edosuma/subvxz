01:17.244 --> 01:19.580
Do you remember the date
you were given access to it?

01:22.791 --> 01:23.792
Andy?

01:26.003 --> 01:27.004
Andy?

01:29.214 --> 01:32.259
Sorry. What was the question?

01:32.843 --> 01:33.927
Need a break?

01:36.305 --> 01:37.973
No, I was just...

01:40.434 --> 01:41.435
No.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.605
Just wanna get this over with.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.692
We were just getting to the cell phone.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.528
<c.styledotitalic>Do you remember the date
you were given access to it?

01:52.029 --> 01:55.407
<c.styledotitalic>Yeah. It was ten days before the trial.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.535
Hey, Mr. B. I thought that was you.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.162
Hey, Bobby. How you doing?

02:00.245 --> 02:02.623
Not too bad.
Can I get you something off the truck?

02:02.706 --> 02:04.583
No, I'm okay. Just waiting for somebody.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.835
All right. Well...

02:07.961 --> 02:09.755
stay strong for your family, okay?

02:19.056 --> 02:21.016
Hey, Andy. They're ready for us.

02:31.902 --> 02:33.612
-I'll let him know.
-You better

02:33.695 --> 02:38.408
Ignore him. He can moan all he wants.
The judge already ruled on the phone.

02:39.076 --> 02:41.453
Mr. Barber
has every right to be here, Neal.

02:41.537 --> 02:43.163
Well, technically
I could argue that he doesn't

02:43.247 --> 02:46.291
since he's a possible witness in the case,
but I'm letting it slide.

02:46.375 --> 02:47.376
What a mensch.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.379
You're not going in there with us,
if that's what you think was gonna happen.

02:50.462 --> 02:52.506
Of course not.
I already examined the cell phone.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.757
We are well aware.

02:53.841 --> 02:57.094
I was up here for something else
unrelated. I do have other cases.

02:57.636 --> 02:58.637
Goodbye, Neal.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.057
And the next time you want
to conceal evidence from us, don't.

03:04.977 --> 03:06.728
Oh, I've been meaning to ask.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.106
How's your father, Andy?

03:11.942 --> 03:12.943
What did you say?

03:13.986 --> 03:15.821
I asked about your father.

03:16.655 --> 03:17.948
How's he doing?

03:18.031 --> 03:20.158
You know, I knew criminal law
was a passion of yours,

03:20.242 --> 03:22.661
but I had no idea
it was the family business.

03:23.245 --> 03:24.872
-You think this is a joke? Do you?
-Hey. Hey!

03:24.955 --> 03:26.248
-Jesus.
-Come on, Andy!

03:26.331 --> 03:27.708
-Back up. Back up!
-Jesus.

03:29.501 --> 03:32.087
-Fuck.
-Don't lecture me about concealing things.

03:32.171 --> 03:33.422
Just let it go.

03:34.256 --> 03:35.090
Hey.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.009
I will say this.

03:37.968 --> 03:42.306
It explains a lot, Andy, about you,
about your son.

03:47.394 --> 03:48.729
Damn it.

03:48.812 --> 03:50.856
-Detective, are you ready for us?
-Yeah.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.568
-You okay?
-Sorry.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.156
Right this way.

04:05.704 --> 04:08.457
We knew he'd find out sooner or later.
It's fine.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.792
Andy, we're already ahead of it.

04:16.048 --> 04:18.341
That's the passcode his parents provided.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.844
-Take all the time you need.
-Thank you, Detective.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.965
-Sorry to keep you.
-That's okay.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.049
Hey.

05:01.218 --> 05:04.137
-Same time next week?
-Actually, today was our last session.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.515
I didn't realize. So then--

05:06.598 --> 05:09.852
So then you and Andy are scheduled
to meet me with Joanna

05:09.935 --> 05:12.062
at the end of next week,
the 17th, I believe.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.856
We can go over everything then.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.399
-The 17th?
-That okay?

05:16.108 --> 05:17.776
Yeah, no, it's just...

05:18.569 --> 05:19.653
that's Jacob's birthday.

05:21.572 --> 05:22.865
Well, if you want, we can just--

05:22.948 --> 05:24.366
No, it's fine.

05:24.950 --> 05:27.119
He has his tutor that day, actually, so...

05:28.412 --> 05:29.538
We'll see you then.

05:30.414 --> 05:31.999
-Ready?
-Yeah.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.044
He's probably a little talked out.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.047
-I'll see you next week.
-Right.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.800
Take care, Jacob. Happy early birthday.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.677
Bye.

06:04.448 --> 06:05.657
You're quiet.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.118
How was your session?

06:09.494 --> 06:12.164
-It was fine. Annoying.
-Annoying?

06:12.247 --> 06:16.752
She just asks me the same questions
every week, or different versions of them.

06:17.252 --> 06:20.005
And when I call her out on it,
she just tries to play dumb,

06:20.088 --> 06:21.715
like she didn't realize
she already asked me.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.717
She's only trying to help us.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.470
If you say so.

06:35.354 --> 06:36.730
Who's that?

06:38.690 --> 06:40.567
Jacob, I asked you who you were texting.

06:40.651 --> 06:41.777
Nobody. Dylan.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.571
Dylan Stone?

06:44.655 --> 06:46.573
He's at a sleepaway camp.

06:46.657 --> 06:49.493
This kid doesn't believe he knows me,
so he's trying to prove it.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.752
How's Sarah?
I haven't heard her name in a while.

07:01.547 --> 07:04.550
It's good for you to have someone
your own age to talk to.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.260
We're not talking, so...

07:08.470 --> 07:10.722
-Is that your doing, or--
-Mom, don't. Please.

07:45.549 --> 07:46.466
Thanks.

07:50.554 --> 07:51.638
Anything?

07:55.684 --> 07:57.477
<c.styledotitalic>About how many hours would you say

07:57.561 --> 08:00.981
you and Ms. Klein spent
with Ben Rifkin's cell phone?

08:01.523 --> 08:04.067
-I don't know. Maybe five hours.
-Five hours?

08:04.568 --> 08:08.697
So you went through every e-mail,
every text, every photo and video?

08:08.780 --> 08:11.825
-Yeah. Everything.
-Looking for what, exactly?

08:13.368 --> 08:14.369
Answers.

08:14.453 --> 08:18.665
The answers you were looking for,
they weren't on that phone, were they?

08:25.797 --> 08:27.466
-Thanks, Detective.
-Yeah. You got it.

08:30.302 --> 08:31.970
It's my office. Can you give me a minute?

08:32.054 --> 08:33.054
Yeah.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.515
Hi. We're just finishing up.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.067
Hey.

08:46.902 --> 08:47.736
Hey.

08:49.321 --> 08:52.282
Listen, I just want you to know, I think
it was fucked up, what Logiudice did.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.786
Nah. He was being a lawyer.

08:56.620 --> 08:59.164
If I was in his place,
I'd probably try to bury the phone too.

09:00.165 --> 09:01.834
No, I think you would have
thought about it,

09:01.917 --> 09:03.627
but you would have done the right thing.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.421
That's not what I was referring to though.

09:11.927 --> 09:13.762
You mean what he said about my father.

09:17.432 --> 09:18.767
Everybody knows, huh?

09:19.810 --> 09:23.272
Started going around yesterday.
You know how people talk around here.

09:26.650 --> 09:28.110
What have you heard?

09:29.945 --> 09:32.614
That he's serving life at Northern
for rape and murder one.

09:39.872 --> 09:41.623
He went in when I was a kid.

09:46.712 --> 09:48.046
I take it Laurie knows?

09:50.591 --> 09:53.844
She does now. Jacob too.

10:03.228 --> 10:04.396
I have a brother.

10:05.439 --> 10:06.732
I told you about him.

10:06.815 --> 10:07.816
Yeah.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.819
So I know what that's like,
carrying something like that around.

10:17.159 --> 10:20.871
Listen, my hands are mostly tied
on this case, but, you know...

10:21.955 --> 10:24.291
if you need any more of my help,
you know how to reach me.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.836
-Thank you.
-Don't underestimate him.

10:27.920 --> 10:31.215
He sounds real sure he's gonna win.
Too sure.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.349
-Shall we go?
-Let's go.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.226
Thanks, Duff.

10:43.769 --> 10:47.898
That was my assistant Ellen.
She has a niece Jacob's age.

10:47.981 --> 10:51.652
They live in Needham, but you know how
all the kids know each other these days.

10:53.028 --> 10:56.156
It seems Jacob
has been going online again.

11:00.577 --> 11:01.662
Jacob!

11:03.580 --> 11:05.707
-Where's Jake?
-Upstairs.

11:05.791 --> 11:08.126
-How did it go with the phone?
-It was a bust.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.004
Jacob!

11:13.340 --> 11:14.716
Are you Jay Kobbs?

11:15.759 --> 11:17.469
-Answer me, damn it!
-Andy.

11:18.136 --> 11:21.348
-It's not that big of a deal.
-Don't tell me what's not a big deal!

11:21.431 --> 11:24.017
Show your mother.
Show her what you've been up to.

11:34.570 --> 11:36.947
Shit. Jacob!

11:37.447 --> 11:38.448
It's just a dumb joke.

11:38.532 --> 11:42.369
Do you have any idea what this looks like?
Joking about being a murder suspect?

11:42.452 --> 11:44.079
It's not like anyone even knows who it is.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.123
Everybody knows! How do you think I know?

11:46.206 --> 11:47.749
Andy, calm down.

11:47.833 --> 11:50.210
This is damaging. This is evidence,

11:50.294 --> 11:53.005
and you're either too stupid
or too arrogant to know the difference.

11:53.088 --> 11:55.090
-I'm not stupid.
-Then what's wrong with you?

11:55.174 --> 11:57.176
Nothing. You're making
too big of a deal out of this.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.511
Do you have any idea
what they're gonna do with this picture?

11:59.595 --> 12:01.346
They're gonna wave it around
in front of the jury,

12:01.430 --> 12:03.599
and they're gonna say
it shows consciousness of guilt.

12:03.682 --> 12:05.392
That's the phrase they're gonna use.

12:05.475 --> 12:09.146
They're gonna say this is
how Jacob Barber sees himself, a psycho.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.106
And they're gonna use that word
over and over again.

12:11.190 --> 12:12.357
Andy, enough.

12:12.441 --> 12:14.067
Jesus Christ.

12:14.151 --> 12:17.154
Do you know what's at stake? Do you
realize what they want to do to you?

12:17.237 --> 12:19.239
Stop it already. You're scaring him.

12:19.323 --> 12:22.034
Good! He should be scared! I'm scared!

12:24.494 --> 12:27.039
It was just a joke. I can delete it.

12:27.122 --> 12:30.417
That doesn't mean it goes away.

12:36.006 --> 12:38.592
Okay. I'm sorry.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.762
You can't do things like this, Jake.
You just can't.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.473
I said I'm sorry.

12:44.556 --> 12:45.974
I think he should delete it anyway.

12:46.058 --> 12:49.269
You're goddamn right he's gonna delete it.
He's gonna delete it right now.

12:53.732 --> 12:55.234
This can't happen again.

12:56.193 --> 12:57.986
I need to know you understand that.

13:00.489 --> 13:02.491
I do. There. It's gone.

13:19.341 --> 13:20.551
I'm sorry I yelled.

13:22.177 --> 13:24.555
I shouldn't have lost my temper. I just...

13:28.183 --> 13:31.562
I'm trying to look out for you, buddy.
You gotta understand that.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.105
Just leave me alone.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.108
-Jake.
-Please.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.030
Okay.

13:46.702 --> 13:48.078
Okay, so go.

13:53.375 --> 13:54.751
There's nothing wrong with me.

13:57.713 --> 13:59.256
I know exactly
what they're gonna do to me.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.841
I don't need you to tell me that.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.574
<c.styledotitalic>An unexpected twist tonight
in the Jacob Barber case.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.785
<c.styledotitalic>We have confirmed that the Newton,
Massachusetts teenager is the grandson

14:28.869 --> 14:31.413
<c.styledotitalic>of William Barber, a man who earned
the nickname "Bloody Billy"...

14:31.496 --> 14:33.040
Looking good there, Billy Boy!

14:33.123 --> 14:36.293
<c.styledotitalic>...after he was convicted of raping
and killing a young Connecticut woman.

14:37.252 --> 14:39.880
<c.styledotitalic>He is now serving
a life sentence for those crimes.

14:40.464 --> 14:42.883
<c.styledotitalic>Presently awaiting trial,
the younger Barber

14:42.966 --> 14:46.678
<c.styledotitalic>is accused of murdering his classmate
Benjamin Rifkin in Cold Spring Park.

14:48.013 --> 14:50.807
<c.styledotitalic>Will there be
a family reunion behind bars?

14:50.891 --> 14:53.852
<c.styledotitalic>This entire case
has been remarkable from the outset.

14:53.936 --> 14:56.647
<c.styledotitalic>You'll recall that the accused's father,
Andrew Barber,

14:56.730 --> 14:58.941
<c.styledotitalic>was in fact
the assistant district attorney

14:59.024 --> 15:03.111
<c.styledotitalic>initially in charge
of the Rifkin murder investigation,

15:03.195 --> 15:07.074
<c.styledotitalic>an investigation that ended
with the arrest of Mr. Barber's own son.

15:11.787 --> 15:13.830
Are you gonna take the garbage out,
or should I?

15:16.208 --> 15:17.334
It's everywhere.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.255
It is what it is.

16:06.550 --> 16:09.761
Have you noticed an old blue car
on the block recently? A Lincoln?

16:09.845 --> 16:11.763
No. I don't think so.

16:11.847 --> 16:13.056
Why? Who is it?

16:13.765 --> 16:16.268
I don't know. I saw him idling in front of
the MacGreeveys' house the other day.

16:16.351 --> 16:17.895
Now he's in front of the Parsons'.

16:27.112 --> 16:28.113
Where?

16:28.739 --> 16:29.865
It's gone.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.660
It's probably nothing. It's okay.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.517
Look, I don't know who this is,
but if you keep calling this number--

16:57.726 --> 16:58.769
Who?

17:00.229 --> 17:03.273
Oh, right, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
of course I remember.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.403
When?

17:11.156 --> 17:12.199
Okay.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.451
All right. I'll find it.

17:26.296 --> 17:27.256
Hey.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.049
What's going on?

17:30.133 --> 17:31.844
Look, I'm sorry I called you so late.
It's just--

17:31.927 --> 17:33.971
Yeah, that's okay. It's okay. What's up?

17:37.224 --> 17:38.225
Matt.

17:39.142 --> 17:40.936
You said you had something to tell me.

17:41.937 --> 17:43.730
I do. It's just...

17:45.774 --> 17:47.526
Wait. Are you the one
who's been coming to my house?

17:48.652 --> 17:49.653
What?

17:50.863 --> 17:53.323
Nothing. Nothing. Forget it. Go.

17:53.407 --> 17:57.160
I wasn't gonna say anything,
'cause, I mean, what's it my business?

17:57.244 --> 18:01.206
But I can't fucking sleep.
It's, like, on me--

18:01.290 --> 18:02.833
Matt, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.084
Your kid...

18:06.211 --> 18:07.379
he didn't do it.

18:14.678 --> 18:18.056
Tell me about Leonard Patz.
Where did you meet him?

18:18.140 --> 18:20.851
I was at C&M. You know, the pizza place.

18:20.934 --> 18:21.977
When was this?

18:23.770 --> 18:24.980
About a year ago. Last summer.

18:25.063 --> 18:26.815
So you were 15 at the time?

18:27.399 --> 18:28.233
Yeah.

18:28.317 --> 18:30.402
This morning is the first I heard
about any of this.

18:30.485 --> 18:32.404
I understand. Please continue.

18:33.113 --> 18:37.117
Anyway, Patz comes up to me
and asked if I wanted something to eat.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.245
<c.styledotitalic>He said he'd buy me whatever I wanted
if I'd sit with him,

18:40.329 --> 18:41.705
<c.styledotitalic>'cause he hated eating alone.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.999
<c.styledotitalic>So I said fine.
What do I care? It's free food.

18:44.082 --> 18:45.083
Hey.

18:46.084 --> 18:47.085
What's up?

18:48.754 --> 18:50.881
Do you need a quarter to play again?

18:50.964 --> 18:53.383
<c.styledotitalic>So we're eating, and he's trying
to sound like some tough guy

18:53.467 --> 18:55.260
<c.styledotitalic>to impress me or whatever, you know,

18:55.344 --> 18:58.514
<c.styledotitalic>and I'm playing along, letting him think
I can't tell what a loser he is.

18:59.097 --> 19:02.434
<c.styledotitalic>And after a while, he starts talking
about his sweet apartment,

19:02.518 --> 19:05.270
<c.styledotitalic>and how he's got all this beer there, and
if I wanna go back and hang out with him.

19:05.354 --> 19:07.773
<c.styledotitalic>-And did you?
-Hell, no. I knew what he wanted.

19:07.856 --> 19:10.651
I told him straight up
I wasn't going anywhere with him...

19:15.030 --> 19:17.950
but maybe if he had some money,
we could work something out.

19:19.743 --> 19:23.580
<c.styledotitalic>So, he says he'll give me 50 bucks
if he can touch me over my pants.

19:23.664 --> 19:25.999
<c.styledotitalic>So, I told him
I'd let him do it for a hundred.

19:26.458 --> 19:29.586
-And he agreed?
-Yeah, like, right away.

19:29.670 --> 19:33.215
<c.styledotitalic>So, after that we'd meet up here and there
whenever he had some cash,

19:33.298 --> 19:35.008
do the same thing, just different places.

19:35.968 --> 19:37.135
He never tried for more?

19:37.219 --> 19:39.304
One time he asked if he could
reach his hand down my pants,

19:39.388 --> 19:40.848
but I told him I'd break his fucking arm.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.517
-How'd he react?
-He backed off quick.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.435
And these meetups,
how many were there in total?

19:45.519 --> 19:47.771
I don't know, six. Maybe seven.

19:47.855 --> 19:49.314
Including the one at the library?

19:49.815 --> 19:51.191
Yeah, that was the last time.

19:51.275 --> 19:53.110
Leonard said
he didn't wanna pay me anymore.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.571
I told him if he didn't,
I'd report him, so I did.

19:55.654 --> 19:59.157
I'm sorry. I don't see
how this relates to our case.

20:00.450 --> 20:02.703
Well, you see, that was
his whole reason for dropping me.

20:02.786 --> 20:05.247
He said there was this new kid
he was into, some kid named Ben.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.084
Just Ben, or did he give a last name?

20:09.168 --> 20:11.044
No, but I know it was the same kid
'cause of the park.

20:11.128 --> 20:12.254
That's where Leonard met him.

20:12.337 --> 20:15.340
So you're saying Patz knew Ben Rifkin?

20:15.424 --> 20:16.967
I don't think he actually knew him.

20:17.050 --> 20:20.762
But he spoke to him a couple times.
Mostly just watched him.

20:21.346 --> 20:23.473
Did he say anything else about Ben?

20:23.557 --> 20:26.226
Just that he was "beautiful."

20:26.310 --> 20:27.519
He used that word.

20:28.562 --> 20:29.563
That's all?

20:30.898 --> 20:31.899
Yeah.

20:34.818 --> 20:36.820
Oh, shit, wait. He also had a knife.

20:37.321 --> 20:40.490
I only saw it once,
but he carried it around sometimes,

20:40.574 --> 20:42.451
you know, in case someone gives him shit.

20:42.534 --> 20:44.286
Anyway, he tried to give it to me
for money one time

20:44.369 --> 20:45.621
and I told him to fuck off.

20:46.038 --> 20:47.122
What did it look like?

20:47.581 --> 20:50.459
A knife, you know?
With those little teeth on the side of it.

20:51.126 --> 20:52.794
It was kind of badass, actually.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.342
Why did it take you this long
to come forward?

20:58.425 --> 21:00.802
Well, I mean,
I got kind of a record, you know,

21:00.886 --> 21:03.931
with the whole possession charge,
and I lied about the whole library thing.

21:04.014 --> 21:06.517
I just kind of wanted to stay out of it,
you know what I mean?

21:06.600 --> 21:09.603
But... I heard that his kid
was getting blamed for it

21:09.686 --> 21:11.772
-and I just kept thinking about--
-Wait a second.

21:11.855 --> 21:14.149
Did Mr. Barber compel you to come forward?

21:14.691 --> 21:15.692
Compel me?

21:15.776 --> 21:17.903
Did you feel pressured in any way
by Mr. Barber?

21:17.986 --> 21:19.196
He called me with this.

21:19.279 --> 21:20.781
Please let him answer, Andy.

21:21.532 --> 21:23.075
No, I mean, he came to me first.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.245
I mean, I didn't tell him anything,

21:26.328 --> 21:28.247
and so I guess, I don't know,
it was a little bit of both.

21:28.330 --> 21:31.375
Yes or no?
Were you coached in any way by Mr. Barber?

21:31.458 --> 21:33.544
No, what I told you is the truth.
I got no reason to lie.

21:33.627 --> 21:36.922
Really? 'Cause you've made it pretty clear
that you'd do a lot of things for money.

21:37.005 --> 21:38.340
-Oh, that's outrageous.
-The fuck?

21:38.423 --> 21:40.300
-That's my kid you're talking about.
-Neal.

21:43.554 --> 21:45.472
-Can I go now?
-Thank you for coming in.

21:45.556 --> 21:46.765
I'm sure this wasn't easy.

21:46.849 --> 21:48.684
Detective Duffy will take down
your information

21:48.767 --> 21:50.644
in case we need to talk with you again.

22:08.745 --> 22:10.956
I don't know what to make
of that boy's story

22:11.039 --> 22:12.791
or how you came to hear of it.

22:12.875 --> 22:14.376
I don't believe a word of it.

22:15.002 --> 22:16.336
It's too convenient.

22:17.129 --> 22:19.006
I can't believe we're entertaining this.

22:29.725 --> 22:31.768
We'll write up a search warrant
for Patz's home.

22:32.477 --> 22:34.104
See if we can turn up a knife.

22:36.356 --> 22:37.399
Thank you.

22:43.906 --> 22:45.991
-This good enough?
-Let me see.

22:46.909 --> 22:48.285
The pants are too short.

22:48.368 --> 22:50.704
The arms too. Shit.

22:51.121 --> 22:52.873
It's a trial, not a fashion show.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.667
I just want you to look your best, okay?

22:56.502 --> 23:00.297
Let people see how handsome you are.
These things are important.

23:00.839 --> 23:02.466
-Hello?
-We're in here.

23:03.717 --> 23:05.344
His suit needs altering again.

23:06.929 --> 23:08.263
Only if there's a trial.

23:09.431 --> 23:10.432
What do you mean?

23:10.516 --> 23:12.309
Lynn approved a search of Patz's house.

23:12.768 --> 23:14.436
-So, they think it's him?
-Well, no. Not yet.

23:14.520 --> 23:16.563
Obviously if they find the knife,
that changes everything,

23:16.647 --> 23:19.024
but at least this puts him
back on the radar.

23:19.107 --> 23:21.568
-Well, that's something, right?
-Yeah.

23:21.652 --> 23:23.362
I know it's him. I know it is.

23:26.073 --> 23:27.199
Sorry, guys.

23:27.282 --> 23:28.492
You go change, honey.

23:30.911 --> 23:31.912
Hello.

23:32.496 --> 23:33.622
There he is.

23:34.957 --> 23:36.333
How'd you get this number?

23:36.416 --> 23:38.418
<c.styledotitalic>-Your wife gave it to me.
-Bullshit.

23:39.461 --> 23:40.462
No.

23:41.338 --> 23:42.923
We got our own...

23:44.299 --> 23:47.427
you know, we call it economy in here.

23:48.053 --> 23:50.889
Believe me, there's tougher things to get
than a phone number.

23:52.015 --> 23:53.350
<c.styledotitalic>Well, you wasted your money.

23:53.433 --> 23:55.477
Hey, don't hang up. Come on.

23:56.353 --> 23:58.146
I did what you asked, didn't I?

23:59.314 --> 24:02.484
<c.styledotitalic>She's a real doll, your wife.

24:02.568 --> 24:05.195
<c.styledotitalic>-I mean, even better-looking in person.
-Don't.

24:05.279 --> 24:07.030
What? It's a compliment.

24:08.323 --> 24:09.700
She's my daughter-in-law. Jesus.

24:09.783 --> 24:11.910
What kind of a sick fuck you think I am?

24:11.994 --> 24:13.453
<c.styledotitalic>I know exactly what kind.

24:19.918 --> 24:21.920
Look, I appreciate your helping us.

24:23.672 --> 24:25.966
Yeah, well, it's all right.

24:29.344 --> 24:32.264
You see, that was on the news
the other day, how you're my kid.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.683
<c.styledotitalic>Yeah, I saw.

24:35.475 --> 24:38.395
I want you to know, I had nothing to do
with that. I said nothing to nobody.

24:39.605 --> 24:40.814
These things get out.

24:40.898 --> 24:44.526
<c.styledotitalic>Yeah, these reporters.
They're real fucking vultures, right?

24:44.610 --> 24:45.736
Is this why you called?

24:47.321 --> 24:48.363
Yeah.

24:48.947 --> 24:50.991
I mean, yeah. That and...

24:53.702 --> 24:55.412
I thought we could talk some more.

24:55.954 --> 24:57.206
Talk?

24:57.289 --> 25:00.125
<c.styledotitalic>Look, I know I'm a shit father.

25:00.209 --> 25:01.418
I don't have a father.

25:04.880 --> 25:07.591
You don't have-- Huh.

25:09.218 --> 25:11.720
How does that work exactly?
What are you, a fucking tree?

25:11.803 --> 25:12.930
<c.styledotitalic>I gotta go.

25:13.013 --> 25:14.765
Yeah, some other time, maybe.

25:14.848 --> 25:16.099
<c.styledotitalic>I don't think so.

25:16.183 --> 25:17.184
Maybe, though.

25:39.706 --> 25:42.668
Morning. I want two officers
stationed in front, another two out back.

25:42.751 --> 25:44.336
-The rest of you follow me.
-Yes, ma'am.

25:47.589 --> 25:50.342
You're the super, right?
Detective Duffy. We spoke earlier.

25:50.425 --> 25:52.427
We need to get up to
Leonard Patz's apartment.

25:52.511 --> 25:53.595
217.

25:53.679 --> 25:54.763
Got it.

26:02.104 --> 26:03.313
<c.styledotitalic>Becky.

26:05.524 --> 26:06.567
<c.styledotitalic>Becky!

26:11.572 --> 26:12.573
<c.styledotitalic>Becky?

26:14.616 --> 26:15.909
<c.styledotitalic>Becky, where are you?

26:16.368 --> 26:17.870
<c.styledotitalic>I'm here, Miles.

26:21.206 --> 26:23.625
<c.styledotitalic>-You didn't go to sleep?
-I'm so tired.

26:24.918 --> 26:27.379
<c.styledotitalic>They weren't people. It was more of them.

26:27.462 --> 26:30.382
<c.styledotitalic>They're growing thousands of pods
in greenhouses. We've got to get away.

26:48.901 --> 26:50.319
Mr. Patz, I'm Detective Duffy.

26:50.402 --> 26:51.945
I'm assigned
to the district attorney's office.

26:52.029 --> 26:53.655
We have a warrant
to search these premises.

27:00.871 --> 27:02.831
Mr. Patz, this is the police. Open up.

27:08.045 --> 27:10.339
Mr. Patz, open up this door right now.

27:16.345 --> 27:20.224
Mr. Patz, open the door
or we will open it for you.

27:31.485 --> 27:32.819
Mr. Patz?

27:33.320 --> 27:34.988
We have a warrant
to search your apartment.

27:40.327 --> 27:42.913
I'm gonna need you to put some clothes on
and wait outside.

30:16.400 --> 30:17.401
Andy?

30:19.736 --> 30:20.821
No knife.

30:21.238 --> 30:23.282
-What?
-They didn't find the knife.

30:23.365 --> 30:25.284
At least not one that matches the weapon.

30:25.367 --> 30:27.286
Doesn't mean they're gonna stop
looking at Patz though.

30:29.329 --> 30:30.455
Honey?

30:30.539 --> 30:31.707
I--

30:31.790 --> 30:34.668
The blue car, the Lincoln,
it was following me.

30:34.751 --> 30:36.837
-Now?
-No, no, no. It's gone.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.172
Did you look at the driver?

30:38.255 --> 30:39.882
No, he was too far away.

30:41.675 --> 30:42.885
Sorry, honey.

30:43.886 --> 30:46.388
Someone's been watching us.
I don't know if it's a reporter

30:46.471 --> 30:48.724
or some psycho trying to scare us or what.

30:48.807 --> 30:50.184
Do you wanna file a report?

30:50.267 --> 30:51.518
What good would that do?

30:51.602 --> 30:53.145
Honestly, not much.

30:53.896 --> 30:57.107
If it happens again, call me immediately.
If I'm in the area...

30:57.191 --> 30:58.358
Okay.

30:58.442 --> 30:59.610
Thanks, Duff.

31:03.864 --> 31:05.449
You are gonna stay on Patz, right?

31:05.532 --> 31:08.160
We'll comb through everything again,
his statement, his movements.

31:08.243 --> 31:10.537
He lied to us that day.
He said he didn't know Ben Rifkin.

31:10.621 --> 31:12.581
According to your boy McGrath.

31:13.207 --> 31:14.791
Look, I'm just saying,
the kid already admitted

31:14.875 --> 31:16.585
to trying to frame Patz
on the whole library thing.

31:16.668 --> 31:20.255
Yeah, I know.
I know, but I believe him on this one.

31:22.132 --> 31:25.177
I'm begging you.
Please do not give up on Patz.

31:26.428 --> 31:27.679
We're running out of time.

31:29.056 --> 31:30.224
I'll do my best.

31:35.270 --> 31:37.523
<c.styledotitalic>Did you honestly think
that you could avoid a trial?

31:39.983 --> 31:41.401
Delay one, at least.

31:42.152 --> 31:44.863
If you were willing to admit
that you rushed to judgment.

31:46.031 --> 31:48.200
But you refused to look at anyone else.

31:50.994 --> 31:54.039
<c.styledotitalic>I wanna go to those last few days
right before the trial.

31:55.499 --> 31:59.127
Did Laurie share your optimism
that Jacob's trial might be avoided?

32:00.170 --> 32:01.171
Yes and no.

32:05.217 --> 32:06.218
<c.styledotitalic>What about you?

32:06.802 --> 32:10.681
<c.styledotitalic>As it became clear there was
no 11th-hour reprieve coming...

32:12.307 --> 32:13.642
<c.styledotitalic>how were you handling it?

32:15.602 --> 32:17.354
<c.styledotitalic>I did the only thing I could do.

32:19.356 --> 32:20.691
<c.styledotitalic>I accepted it.

32:22.192 --> 32:23.318
Fuck.

32:24.444 --> 32:25.988
Jesus. Fuck.

32:29.616 --> 32:31.285
Hey, what are you doing?

32:31.368 --> 32:33.328
-I know. I know what you did.
-What?

32:33.912 --> 32:35.581
What are you talking abo-- You just--

32:36.123 --> 32:38.333
-Oh, fuck, you're the father.
-I know you killed him!

32:38.417 --> 32:41.044
Oh, Jesus, you're the father. Okay.
You need to leave me alone.

32:41.128 --> 32:43.505
My son's not gonna go away
because of you. You understand me?

32:43.589 --> 32:45.174
-Stay away from me.
-Hey!

32:45.257 --> 32:46.758
I know what you did.

32:48.051 --> 32:51.346
I know it was you, Leonard!
I know it was you!

32:53.182 --> 32:54.725
<c.styledotitalic>What about Jacob?

32:54.808 --> 32:56.101
How was he holding up?

32:59.021 --> 33:02.232
He tried to stay busy with schoolwork,
watched movies.

33:03.942 --> 33:06.361
We were all just waiting
for the hourglass to run out.

33:06.445 --> 33:08.906
He had a 15th birthday that week,
didn't he?

33:09.907 --> 33:11.283
August 17th.

33:11.950 --> 33:13.660
Four days before the trial.

33:14.786 --> 33:17.956
Now, how would you go about
calculating this sum?

33:19.833 --> 33:22.753
-I'd add up the interior angles.
-Good.

33:23.879 --> 33:25.422
We'll be back in a few hours.

33:26.131 --> 33:27.257
Bye, birthday boy.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.427
Now, don't forget there's a trick.

33:43.232 --> 33:45.275
I'm ready for you. Come on in.

33:47.903 --> 33:50.906
<c.styledotitalic>As you know, I've been evaluating Jacob
for the last several weeks

33:50.989 --> 33:52.741
using a number of diagnostic tools:

33:52.824 --> 33:56.495
a Basic Personality Inventory,
a Problematic Traits Inventory,

33:56.578 --> 33:59.164
and all the results,
they're in the report.

33:59.248 --> 34:02.167
I also tested his IQ,
which is unusually high,

34:02.251 --> 34:05.337
and his EQ, his empathy quotient.

34:05.420 --> 34:09.216
The report also contains the results
from the genetic testing that I conducted,

34:09.299 --> 34:11.885
and it includes the MAOA mutation,

34:11.969 --> 34:15.597
what's commonly known as
the warrior gene or the murder gene.

34:16.723 --> 34:17.558
And?

34:17.641 --> 34:21.895
Andy's father tested positive
for the mutation, as did Andy.

34:21.978 --> 34:23.480
Jacob did not.

34:25.148 --> 34:26.024
No?

34:26.108 --> 34:27.775
The thing is, that's not...

34:28.777 --> 34:31.405
MAOA wasn't really central
to my evaluation,

34:31.487 --> 34:34.241
since it's actually inherited
from the mother and not the father.

34:35.242 --> 34:36.952
Well then,
what was the purpose of the testing?

34:37.034 --> 34:40.914
Because there are similar genes
that are passed down from father to son.

34:42.958 --> 34:46.670
For instance, GRIN-1,
which is a glutamate receptor subunit.

34:46.753 --> 34:50.549
It's been linked to traits
like impulsivity and recklessness.

34:50.632 --> 34:52.759
All three generations of Barber males

34:52.842 --> 34:57.181
tested positive for the GRIN-1 variant,
including Jacob.

34:58.390 --> 35:02.895
There's also a dopamine gene
linked to a limited capacity for empathy.

35:03.187 --> 35:07.232
Again, all three generations
of Barber males tested positive.

35:07.816 --> 35:11.195
And finally,
there's a form of testosterone receptor

35:11.278 --> 35:14.656
known to induce violent behavior
in adolescents shortly after puberty--

35:14.740 --> 35:16.950
And Jacob-- Jacob has that form?

35:17.034 --> 35:20.996
Jacob does, yes, as do Andy and Billy.

35:24.333 --> 35:27.461
But if a young person
is already capable of moral reasoning,

35:27.544 --> 35:30.464
these genes won't just cause the brain
to flip a switch,

35:30.547 --> 35:33.383
and I will point to Andy as proof.

35:33.467 --> 35:35.719
Still, what Dr. Vogel is saying is,

35:35.802 --> 35:40.015
if we wind up with the worst-case scenario
where Jacob's found guilty,

35:40.098 --> 35:41.767
we would have a genetic basis

35:41.850 --> 35:45.103
to argue mitigation
when it goes to sentencing.

35:45.187 --> 35:50.067
That's not gonna happen, but it's
important to know as much as possible.

35:50.150 --> 35:51.401
Just in case.

35:55.113 --> 35:57.658
Well, now we know.

35:58.784 --> 36:01.495
And is he capable of moral reasoning?

36:02.412 --> 36:05.832
There are things in here...
"antisocial tendencies"--

36:05.916 --> 36:09.253
-Laurie, that's just psychobabble.
-I'm asking Dr. Vogel.

36:09.336 --> 36:11.505
It's not a simple yes or no answer.

36:12.840 --> 36:15.259
I think you should read the entire report,
and then, if you want,

36:15.342 --> 36:18.136
we can have a conversation
on how to best address Jacob's issues.

36:18.220 --> 36:21.557
But obviously right now
the concern isn't therapy, it's the trial.

36:21.640 --> 36:24.768
-So there are issues?
-He's a teenager. They all have issues.

36:25.394 --> 36:26.854
Andy's not wrong.

36:27.437 --> 36:30.399
However, if there was one area of concern,

36:30.482 --> 36:33.110
it would be his capacity for empathy.

36:33.193 --> 36:35.946
Once again,
the report goes into full detail.

36:36.029 --> 36:36.947
How do you mean?

36:37.030 --> 36:38.991
Laurie, this isn't really the time
to have this conversation.

36:39.074 --> 36:40.576
I want to know what she means.

36:41.869 --> 36:45.789
Well, for example, I brought up
Ben Rifkin in one of our sessions,

36:45.873 --> 36:48.709
and Jacob's response was that...

36:50.127 --> 36:52.462
people die every day by the millions.

36:52.546 --> 36:54.715
And when I tried to prod him,

36:54.798 --> 36:57.759
to express some emotion
around Ben's murder...

36:58.760 --> 37:01.388
Jacob's answers felt...

37:02.764 --> 37:03.891
practiced.

37:04.558 --> 37:05.976
That's because you don't know him.

37:06.059 --> 37:08.228
I mean,
he's not a touchy-feely kid, that's--

37:09.730 --> 37:11.732
-He has empathy.
-You think he did it.

37:12.608 --> 37:13.609
I didn't say that.

37:14.318 --> 37:15.485
-You didn't have to.
-Laurie.

37:15.569 --> 37:19.364
I have absolutely no way of knowing
if Jacob did or did not do it.

37:19.448 --> 37:22.117
-And it's also not my job.
-But you think he might have done it.

37:22.201 --> 37:24.828
-Laurie, this isn't productive.
-You do. You think it's possible.

37:24.912 --> 37:27.706
Will you stop? Anything in there you could
say about a million other teenagers.

37:27.789 --> 37:29.666
-Very true.
-Then why won't you answer me?

37:29.750 --> 37:30.792
-Laurie.
-Don't.

37:30.876 --> 37:32.920
You never see these things,
you never saw them then.

37:33.003 --> 37:35.422
You were so desperate to be normal,
for us all to be normal.

37:35.506 --> 37:36.965
-We are normal.
-Oh, my God, Andy,

37:37.049 --> 37:38.926
-do you think this is normal?
-This situation?

37:39.009 --> 37:41.803
Of course not, but Jacob, yes.
I know he is.

37:41.887 --> 37:45.307
And this, this doesn't change anything.
This means nothing.

37:45.390 --> 37:46.808
Just answer me.

37:52.731 --> 37:53.732
Please.

37:58.737 --> 37:59.905
I wish I could.

38:11.708 --> 38:14.127
Look, we can just call this off
and do something at home.

38:14.211 --> 38:17.756
No. He's about to go through hell.
We're doing this.

38:29.977 --> 38:31.478
-How's everything?
-Good. Thank you.

38:37.276 --> 38:39.111
I don't see why you guys won't tell me.

38:39.194 --> 38:41.154
Because it's between us and Dr. Vogel.

38:42.281 --> 38:44.074
What happened to me
being treated like an adult?

38:45.117 --> 38:46.243
This is such bullshit.

38:46.326 --> 38:49.037
Hey, enough with the swearing.
It's like every other word with you.

38:49.121 --> 38:51.498
I have a right to know about my own brain.

38:51.582 --> 38:53.125
I took every one of her tests.

38:53.208 --> 38:54.877
I answered every one
of her stupid questions.

38:54.960 --> 38:58.463
She thought you were a good kid,
which we already knew.

38:59.006 --> 39:00.507
This whole thing's a formality.

39:01.425 --> 39:02.676
Okay?

39:03.552 --> 39:04.595
I don't believe you.

39:05.262 --> 39:07.806
Honey, it's your birthday.
Let's talk about something else.

39:10.350 --> 39:12.311
-What about the murder gene?
-You don't have it.

39:16.398 --> 39:17.441
Really?

39:19.067 --> 39:19.985
Really.

39:27.993 --> 39:29.411
So there's nothing wrong with me?

39:35.000 --> 39:36.251
Happy birthday, bud.

39:36.752 --> 39:37.586
Thank you.

39:41.298 --> 39:42.382
Happy birthday.

39:42.966 --> 39:43.967
Make a wish.

39:45.802 --> 39:47.095
Kind of a no-brainer.

40:07.449 --> 40:08.825
Thank you for tonight.

40:10.661 --> 40:14.581
It was nice being normal again,
even if it was just pretending.

40:16.542 --> 40:17.793
It was your mom's idea.

40:19.002 --> 40:20.379
Glad you had a good time.

40:29.388 --> 40:31.139
I think I'm ready for Monday.

40:31.557 --> 40:32.641
Yeah?

40:33.767 --> 40:34.768
Yeah.

40:36.061 --> 40:38.814
Mrs. Mandel had me write an essay
about it the other day.

40:40.482 --> 40:44.736
I said it was like
sailing towards an iceberg.

40:45.821 --> 40:50.951
This little white peak in the distance,
getting closer and closer...

40:53.036 --> 40:55.163
but really, it's been underneath us
the whole time.

41:06.175 --> 41:07.843
I thought you were anti-metaphor?

41:29.364 --> 41:31.575
Oh, my God. It's that car.

41:41.335 --> 41:42.669
-Andy, don't.
-Wait here.

41:43.086 --> 41:43.921
Dad?

41:49.426 --> 41:51.261
-Andy!
-Take Jacob inside.

41:54.181 --> 41:55.641
-What's going on?
-It's all right. Come on.

42:12.324 --> 42:14.451
-What the hell do you want with us?
-Excuse me?

42:14.535 --> 42:17.037
You've been watching my house
and following my wife.

42:17.871 --> 42:19.748
I don't know
what you're talking about, pal.

42:19.831 --> 42:21.375
I'm not gonna ask you again.

42:22.167 --> 42:23.544
Easy, tough guy.

42:23.627 --> 42:25.462
You don't want to be a tough guy tonight,
believe me.

42:25.546 --> 42:27.339
I don't want to see you
on this street again.

42:27.798 --> 42:28.966
It's a public street.

42:29.716 --> 42:30.884
Not for you, it's not.

42:34.388 --> 42:36.265
You should get back to your family.

42:37.015 --> 42:38.392
It's good to have a family.

42:40.894 --> 42:43.313
Take care of that family of yours,
Mr. Barber.

42:48.527 --> 42:51.655
Yeah, 75K SA2. Yeah.

42:55.158 --> 42:56.368
Damn it.

42:56.451 --> 42:58.328
No, I figured as much.

42:59.538 --> 43:01.164
It's okay. Thanks, Duff.

43:02.499 --> 43:03.417
Okay.

43:06.170 --> 43:08.172
It's registered to a Honda Accord.

43:09.464 --> 43:10.507
So it's stolen?

43:11.633 --> 43:13.510
All it takes is a screwdriver.

43:14.428 --> 43:15.429
So what now?

43:16.805 --> 43:18.807
Duff's gonna have one of her guys
patrol the neighborhood

43:18.891 --> 43:20.309
for the next couple nights.

43:20.392 --> 43:22.769
I doubt he'll come back.
He's probably just a reporter.

43:26.815 --> 43:29.109
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

43:35.574 --> 43:36.658
Good night, Mom.

43:40.579 --> 43:41.788
Thank you for tonight.

43:44.124 --> 43:45.459
Good night, sweetheart.

43:46.210 --> 43:47.544
Happy birthday.

43:55.552 --> 43:56.637
<c.styledotitalic>And that was it?

43:58.138 --> 43:59.473
That was it.

44:01.433 --> 44:03.477
Couple more days and it was over.

44:08.190 --> 44:09.483
We hit the iceberg.
