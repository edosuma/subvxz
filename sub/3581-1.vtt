00:55.400 --> 00:56.447
Are they on?

00:56.600 --> 00:58.967
Yep. So, introduce yourself.

00:59.160 --> 01:02.164
Okay. Hey, I'm Frank. How you doing?

01:02.840 --> 01:04.649
Don't answer that. That's rhetorical.

01:05.680 --> 01:09.162
Okay. Let's get you up to speed.

01:10.120 --> 01:14.045
This is a story about the future.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.964
And the future

01:16.400 --> 01:18.004
<i>can be scary.</i>

01:21.080 --> 01:22.241
<i>What?</i>

01:22.400 --> 01:24.607
<i>Are you sure
you wanna go with "scary"?</i>

01:24.760 --> 01:26.125
<i>Yes, I wanna go with scary.</i>

01:26.280 --> 01:27.964
<i>- Okay.
- Okay.</i>

01:28.720 --> 01:32.247
<i>The future can be scary.</i>

01:32.800 --> 01:36.407
<i>Unstable governments,
overpopulation,</i>

01:36.760 --> 01:38.728
<i>wars on every continent,</i>

01:38.880 --> 01:43.169
<i>famine, water shortages,
environmental collapse...</i>

01:43.240 --> 01:46.403
<i>And scientific breakthroughs,
wonder and beauty...</i>

01:46.840 --> 01:48.524
Could you please just stop interrupting?

01:48.600 --> 01:50.523
I will. Just try to be
a little more upbeat.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.011
- "Upbeat"?
- Yeah, tell them what you like...

01:52.080 --> 01:54.526
I can't tell them anything
if you keep interrupting me.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.840
You're right. Sorry.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.331
As I was saying...

01:57.480 --> 02:02.281
<i>With every second
that ticks by, we get closer and closer...</i>

02:02.360 --> 02:04.010
<i>I know. Tell them about when...</i>

02:04.080 --> 02:06.401
<i>I can't tell them anything
until I tell them about this.</i>

02:06.520 --> 02:08.806
<i>Then, can we please
just start somewhere else?</i>

02:08.880 --> 02:11.201
Fine. Where would you like me to start?

02:11.280 --> 02:14.523
Well, you keep saying the future
wasn't always this way, right?

02:14.600 --> 02:16.682
It wasn't.
When I was a kid, the future was...

02:16.760 --> 02:18.683
- Different, right?
- Yeah.

02:19.120 --> 02:21.009
Okay, cool. Then, start there.

02:22.840 --> 02:27.971
All right. Well, when I was a kid,
the future was different.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.604
Flushing Meadows Corona Park,
World's Fair.

02:35.680 --> 02:38.923
Don't forget your valuables
and enjoy the future.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.049
Watch your step, kiddo.

03:25.920 --> 03:28.082
- Hello, sir.
- May I help you?

03:28.160 --> 03:31.881
My name is John Francis Walker.
I'm here to win the $50.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.007
Is that so?

03:34.440 --> 03:36.568
I took it apart because of
the nitrogen compartment.

03:36.640 --> 03:39.291
Seeing as how the bus ride
was kind of bumpy

03:39.360 --> 03:41.169
and you know nitro.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.281
I could've used
a hydrogen peroxide-powered engine.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.567
Bell Labs tested that
with their Rocket Belt

03:47.640 --> 03:48.846
and I guess there were some issues

03:48.920 --> 03:52.129
with maneuverability,
flight duration, and stuff.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.401
It's a jet pack.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.001
Obviously.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.481
You made this yourself?

04:03.800 --> 04:05.325
Athena, what are you doing here?

04:08.600 --> 04:11.171
Did you or didn't you?

04:13.720 --> 04:15.961
- What?
- Did you make this yourself?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.081
Yeah.

04:18.600 --> 04:19.647
Why?

04:20.519 --> 04:25.606
I guess I got tired of waiting around
for someone else to do it for me.

04:29.360 --> 04:30.566
Does it work?

04:33.680 --> 04:35.091
Sure. Yeah.

04:41.320 --> 04:42.367
Mostly.

04:46.280 --> 04:49.807
Just doesn't really,
you know, technically...

05:03.640 --> 05:05.130
...fly.

05:07.960 --> 05:09.689
<i>But if it did, "You know,</i>

05:09.760 --> 05:12.240
"technically fly,"
what would its purpose be?

05:12.320 --> 05:14.448
How would your jet pack
make the world a better place?

05:15.040 --> 05:16.201
Can't it just be fun?

05:16.280 --> 05:19.489
Mr. Walker, please tell me
you can do better than "fun."

05:20.360 --> 05:21.885
Anything's possible.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.244
I don't know what that means.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.640
If I was walking down the street,

05:25.720 --> 05:28.451
and I saw some kid with
a jet pack fly over me,

05:28.520 --> 05:30.363
I'd believe anything's possible.

05:30.440 --> 05:31.805
I'd be inspired.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.440
Doesn't that make
the world a better place?

05:35.600 --> 05:37.125
Well, I suppose it would.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.084
If it worked.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.965
Unfortunately, it does not.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.691
And if it doesn't work,
it has no purpose at all.

05:47.760 --> 05:50.764
- Thank you for your time, Mr. Walker.
- But I can make it work!

05:51.520 --> 05:53.170
That's the spirit.

05:53.240 --> 05:56.847
Until then, young man, have fun.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.849
Absolutely not.

06:11.480 --> 06:15.246
- I like him.
- Athena, no.

06:28.960 --> 06:31.884
What makes you
think you're gonna make this thing fly?

06:31.960 --> 06:33.291
I'm optimistic.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.124
- You're wasting your time.
- I'm not!

06:35.200 --> 06:37.806
- Damn contraption.
- It's not a contraption!

06:37.880 --> 06:40.167
- It doesn't work.
- I can make it work.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.605
No, you can't!

06:42.600 --> 06:44.489
I'm not giving up.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.402
Don't turn around. Be cool.

06:50.760 --> 06:52.125
What did I just tell you?

06:52.200 --> 06:54.168
- Sorry.
- Stop talking.

06:54.240 --> 06:55.685
Look over there. Five o'clock.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.891
You know, on a clock?

07:01.360 --> 07:02.850
Where the five is.

07:06.320 --> 07:08.004
That way.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.561
I'm going with them.

07:11.720 --> 07:15.327
You count to 20, then follow us.
Don't get spotted.

07:20.520 --> 07:21.806
Who are you?

07:23.880 --> 07:25.564
I'm the future, Frank Walker.

07:46.640 --> 07:49.086
Nice. Do you like it?

07:53.560 --> 07:57.770
<i>Travel the globe
in Walt Disney's "it's a small world."</i>

07:57.920 --> 08:00.127
<i>A salute to UNICEF
and children everywhere.</i>

08:00.200 --> 08:01.247
Excuse me.

08:01.320 --> 08:04.085
<i>It's the happiest cruise ever to set sail.</i>

08:05.320 --> 08:08.005
Sorry. Excuse me.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.889
Sorry, folks, you're gonna have
to wait for the next boat.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.600
There'll be another boat
in just a minute.

09:17.440 --> 09:18.680
Hello?

09:20.360 --> 09:21.885
Hello?

09:23.360 --> 09:24.691
Hello?

09:33.800 --> 09:37.361
<i>Good afternoon.
Please step aboard the transport.</i>

09:38.000 --> 09:39.889
<i>The site is active.</i>

09:52.760 --> 09:57.129
<i>Please put on your head protection
in order to prevent significant injury.</i>

09:58.760 --> 10:00.171
"Injury"?

10:06.520 --> 10:10.161
<i>Transport will commence
in 10 seconds.</i>

10:12.200 --> 10:13.281
Wait!

10:14.280 --> 10:15.281
Wait!

10:15.360 --> 10:16.646
<i>- Five...</i>
- Wait!

10:16.840 --> 10:18.330
<i>- Four...</i>
- No!

10:18.480 --> 10:19.811
<i>Three...</i>

10:19.960 --> 10:21.291
<i>Two...</i>

10:21.440 --> 10:22.441
<i>One...</i>

11:21.080 --> 11:23.287
No, phases one and two took a...

12:33.360 --> 12:35.328
Hey! That's mine!

12:41.600 --> 12:43.364
Did you just fix it?

12:44.880 --> 12:46.211
Hey!

12:55.920 --> 12:57.649
Hey! There he is.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.607
Hey!

14:53.040 --> 14:54.087
Hey!

15:17.000 --> 15:18.081
It works now.

15:27.760 --> 15:31.207
So, what is this place?

15:42.360 --> 15:44.681
<i>And then everything went to hell.</i>

15:45.400 --> 15:46.970
<i>- Oh, boy.
- Well, it did.</i>

15:47.040 --> 15:49.964
<i>So you gave them, like, one second
of blue skies and jet packs and hope...</i>

15:50.040 --> 15:52.247
<i>It's important.
They need to know the stakes.</i>

15:52.320 --> 15:55.130
<i>I think they can figure out
clocks counting down are bad.</i>

15:55.200 --> 15:56.531
- Do you wanna tell the story?
- No, you're doing fine.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.130
Because if you think
you can tell the story better,

15:58.200 --> 16:00.407
I would absolutely love to hear you try.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.363
- Really?
- Really.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.767
I guess, technically,
I am more qualified.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.731
Are you? How so?

16:08.360 --> 16:11.489
Because, unlike you, I'm an optimist.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.043
- Babe, you filming?
- It's video.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.447
- I knew it!
- Are you videoing?

16:16.520 --> 16:17.965
Okay. Go ahead, sweetie.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.491
Do your thing, Casey.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.483
That's Sirius.

16:21.560 --> 16:23.562
That's Canopus.

16:23.640 --> 16:25.483
That's Arcturus.

16:25.560 --> 16:27.164
Rigil Kentaurus.

16:27.240 --> 16:32.406
Vega, Procyon, Capella, Betelgeuse.

16:32.560 --> 16:35.086
And why do you love
the stars so much, Casey?

16:36.800 --> 16:39.849
Because I wanna go there.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.604
But it's so far away.

16:41.680 --> 16:43.842
It'll take a long time. A real long time.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.208
What if you get all the way up there,
and there's nothing?

16:48.720 --> 16:52.611
What if there's everything?

16:52.680 --> 16:54.045
<i>- Oh, boy.
- What?</i>

16:54.120 --> 16:55.724
<i>Are you gonna go through
your entire childhood?</i>

16:55.800 --> 16:58.121
<i>You started when you were a kid.
I'm just giving them context.</i>

16:58.200 --> 17:00.009
<i>Just move it along. Okay?
They don't have all day.</i>

17:00.120 --> 17:01.167
<i>Cool. You got it.</i>

20:03.320 --> 20:04.845
Identify yourself!

20:04.920 --> 20:06.160
Nate!

20:06.400 --> 20:08.641
If you wake up Dad, I will crush you.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.963
You shouldn't sneak out.

20:11.080 --> 20:13.481
Well, you shouldn't still need a wubby.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.882
Dad says it's okay to sleep with.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.247
That's because
he doesn't want you to grow up.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.849
Were you at the platform again?

20:22.080 --> 20:23.923
What do you do out there?

20:24.320 --> 20:27.130
Are you trying to stop them
from taking it down?

20:28.480 --> 20:31.370
That would make me a criminal.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.647
And a pretty terrible role model

20:33.720 --> 20:35.802
to impressionable youth
such as yourself.

20:36.640 --> 20:39.610
But if someone else did it,

20:40.320 --> 20:44.564
I'd have to assume they believed

20:44.680 --> 20:50.369
even the teeniest of actions
could change the future.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.409
How can you be sure?

20:53.760 --> 20:56.161
Because I know how things work.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.002
Why are they taking the platform down?

21:01.680 --> 21:05.730
Because it's hard to have ideas
and easy to give up.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.766
But you won't. Right?

21:13.160 --> 21:14.685
Never.

21:57.680 --> 21:59.682
Hey, Dad. Heading to school.

22:01.080 --> 22:02.570
- I made you lunch.
- Hey!

22:02.720 --> 22:04.085
Wrap it up.

22:12.840 --> 22:15.320
- How did you do...
- You would have gotten it.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.241
Yeah, Eddie Newton.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.411
What?

22:22.840 --> 22:24.569
All three cranes?

22:25.200 --> 22:28.522
All right, Douglas.
Thanks for the call. Bye.

22:28.600 --> 22:29.681
Everything okay?

22:29.760 --> 22:31.842
Yeah, the equipment over
at Canaveral is down again.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.128
- Weird.
- Really weird.

22:36.520 --> 22:38.045
Well, at least you get the day off.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.327
Actually, they're bringing in
replacement cranes from Orlando,

22:40.400 --> 22:42.607
so I will be back to work by noon.

22:43.600 --> 22:44.840
That's fantastic.

22:44.920 --> 22:46.968
- Case.
- Yeah?

22:47.120 --> 22:49.441
Nothing's gonna stop them
from taking down that platform.

22:49.960 --> 22:53.123
Nothing. And when we're done,
I'm out of a job.

22:53.280 --> 22:56.762
There's nothing anyone can do about it.
It's inevitable.

22:56.840 --> 23:00.128
Well, then you'll find something else.
You're a NASA engineer.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.643
With nothing to launch.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.922
- There are two wolves.
- Case.

23:09.080 --> 23:12.971
You told me this story my entire life,
and now I'm telling you.

23:13.880 --> 23:17.168
There are two wolves,
and they're always fighting.

23:17.320 --> 23:20.802
One is darkness and despair.

23:21.560 --> 23:24.006
The other is light and hope.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.607
Which wolf wins?

23:28.440 --> 23:29.965
Come on, Case.

23:30.120 --> 23:32.441
Okay. Fine, don't answer.

23:33.840 --> 23:35.171
Whichever one you feed.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.206
Good.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.001
Eat.

23:42.520 --> 23:43.646
Come on.

23:44.800 --> 23:48.441
Mutually assured destruction.

23:48.600 --> 23:53.447
Today, any nuclear country or terrorist
is capable of inflicting damage

23:53.520 --> 23:56.683
on a massive scale with weapons of...

23:56.960 --> 23:58.769
Environmental entropy.

23:58.840 --> 24:01.764
The polar ice caps
aren't waiting for us to decide

24:01.840 --> 24:03.922
if climate change is real.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.209
Rising coastal waters,
intensifying weather patterns.

24:07.280 --> 24:10.204
They're all punching
our one-way ticket to...

24:10.360 --> 24:14.046
Dystopia. By definition, "not perfect."

24:14.200 --> 24:16.202
Huxley's <i>Brave New World,</i>

24:16.280 --> 24:18.567
Bradbury's <i>Fahrenheit 451,</i>

24:18.640 --> 24:21.246
Orwell's <i>1984.</i>

24:21.320 --> 24:23.721
Once considered fiction,
these futuristic novels

24:23.800 --> 24:26.644
are actually happening right now
and they seem to be getting worse.

24:26.720 --> 24:27.881
Yes, Miss Newton?

24:28.120 --> 24:29.485
Can we fix it?

24:30.440 --> 24:31.441
Sorry?

24:31.560 --> 24:35.849
I get things are bad.
But what are we doing to fix it?

24:39.080 --> 24:41.242
Have a good weekend, everybody.

25:20.760 --> 25:23.331
- Newton?
- Yeah.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.528
You made bail.
Motorcycle is in impound.

25:25.600 --> 25:28.046
You can pick up
your personal effects over there.

25:34.120 --> 25:35.884
- Newton?
- Yeah.

25:43.360 --> 25:44.407
All right.

25:48.240 --> 25:49.605
All right.

25:49.680 --> 25:53.651
Okay, one money clip, $47.32,

25:53.760 --> 25:56.525
one Florida state driver's license,
one baseball cap.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.603
You got one pin,

25:58.680 --> 26:00.682
one pack of Beemans gum,
and I don't know what this is.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.444
Sign here.

26:11.480 --> 26:13.801
- That's not mine.
- What's not yours?

26:13.880 --> 26:15.211
The pin. I've never...

26:34.840 --> 26:36.842
No way.

27:08.520 --> 27:10.010
Have I been here the whole time?

27:11.520 --> 27:12.521
I know.

27:15.400 --> 27:16.561
No!

27:18.040 --> 27:19.041
I got it.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.324
You have no idea
of the strings I had to pull

27:31.400 --> 27:33.801
to keep Homeland Security
from pressing charges, Casey.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.161
This is not just vandalism. All right?

27:36.240 --> 27:39.767
- It's NASA. It's government property.
- Have you ever seen this before?

27:40.360 --> 27:43.330
You're not getting it, are you?
I am very upset with you!

27:43.400 --> 27:44.880
I get it, you're angry. I understand.

27:44.920 --> 27:47.040
But I just need you to look at it.
Does it look weird?

27:47.760 --> 27:50.206
- Don't touch it!
- Why are you yelling at me?

27:50.360 --> 27:52.761
Not while you're driving, Dad.
It's dangerous.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.410
Just pull over.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.087
Pull over.

27:58.440 --> 28:00.522
I swear to God, Case,
if you're on drugs...

28:00.600 --> 28:03.251
I'm not on drugs. Just look.

28:04.560 --> 28:06.369
I need you to be NASA Dad now.

28:06.440 --> 28:09.364
New Frontier Dad. Okay?

28:12.960 --> 28:17.124
All will be explained
as soon as you touch this pin.

28:30.160 --> 28:31.241
What is...

28:32.920 --> 28:34.490
It's not working?

28:41.400 --> 28:43.721
You're not seeing this?

28:43.880 --> 28:44.961
Stop it.

28:46.920 --> 28:50.447
Honestly, Casey,
I don't know what's gotten into you.

30:15.640 --> 30:17.369
Middle of the night...

31:47.160 --> 31:49.481
- A little help, guys?
- Zen move, Dexter.

31:49.560 --> 31:50.891
Totally swift.

31:54.760 --> 31:57.843
Come on, idiots.
We're gonna be late for R and D.

32:46.640 --> 32:54.366
<i>The HoverRail will be
arriving in one minute.</i>

33:17.040 --> 33:20.044
- Are you coming?
- You can see me?

33:20.200 --> 33:22.009
We don't have all day.

33:23.240 --> 33:24.571
Wait for us!

33:24.720 --> 33:27.451
<i>Northbound line now departing.</i>

33:29.920 --> 33:32.287
<i>Next stop, Spaceport.</i>

34:17.800 --> 34:19.962
Wow! Look at the rings!

34:23.239 --> 34:25.163
Wow! Cool!

34:25.239 --> 34:27.561
Be sure to follow the procedures strictly.

34:27.639 --> 34:29.369
You know how you need your sleep.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.010
Dad, you're embarrassing me.

34:31.080 --> 34:34.163
- Do you promise to transmit every day?
- Even when you're out of range.

34:34.239 --> 34:37.608
Come on, what's the big deal?
We're only going 20 light-years out.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.766
<i>Now arriving, Spaceport.</i>

35:21.040 --> 35:22.371
Come on, please.

35:24.880 --> 35:26.041
I'll be okay.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.440
Hey, guys. Over here.

35:27.560 --> 35:28.686
- Hey!
- Hey!

35:29.120 --> 35:32.567
Come on, please! I love you guys.

35:32.720 --> 35:35.803
You're going to make me cry in
front of my friends, okay?

35:35.960 --> 35:37.724
Bye! Bye!

36:00.560 --> 36:03.211
Come on. We saved a seat just for you.

36:12.920 --> 36:15.161
Now you run out of power?

36:19.040 --> 36:20.166
- Nate, wake up!
- I didn't do it!

36:20.280 --> 36:21.520
Dad changed
the password to his computer.

36:21.600 --> 36:22.931
Do you know it?

36:23.440 --> 36:25.169
You smell like swamp.

36:25.240 --> 36:27.129
Tell me the password
and you can go back to sleep.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.690
Your phone has Internet.

36:29.160 --> 36:33.131
- My phone got soaked in a lagoon.
- Fine.

36:34.120 --> 36:36.282
What are we looking for?

36:38.080 --> 36:40.242
Here we go.

36:40.680 --> 36:41.727
Stop! That's it.

36:42.560 --> 36:44.722
"Extremely rare collectible pin

36:44.800 --> 36:47.883
"commemorating
the 1964 World's Fair."

36:48.080 --> 36:51.562
"Experts and purveyors of the most
extensive selection of space-age

36:51.640 --> 36:53.085
"collectibles in the world."

36:53.360 --> 36:55.647
This site is like, ancient.

36:55.800 --> 36:57.131
Okay. Give me their number.

36:57.960 --> 37:01.646
- They don't have a number.
- They don't have a number?

37:01.800 --> 37:03.404
They have an address.

37:03.480 --> 37:07.201
Okay, look. You are gonna
tell Dad you woke up, saw me leaving.

37:07.280 --> 37:10.568
I told you I was going camping with
friends, and I will call tomorrow.

37:10.640 --> 37:13.530
- Can you do that for me?
- Only if you tell me what's going on.

37:19.040 --> 37:20.883
I think that I saw...

37:23.200 --> 37:26.966
That I went to the future.

37:30.320 --> 37:31.560
Can I come, too?

37:33.200 --> 37:35.202
Not yet.

37:59.800 --> 38:02.087
Hello! Is Casey Newton home?

38:02.880 --> 38:04.166
No.

38:04.320 --> 38:06.448
She ordered some cookies
and I'm delivering them.

38:07.400 --> 38:10.210
- You're a Girl Scout?
- Of course I am.

38:10.360 --> 38:13.284
- Why aren't you wearing a uniform?
- It's at the cleaners.

38:13.360 --> 38:15.488
Those are Oreos.

38:17.720 --> 38:19.882
Could you please tell me
when Casey will be back?

38:20.240 --> 38:21.765
She went camping with some friends.

38:21.840 --> 38:23.888
She's gonna be gone
for a couple of days.

38:24.080 --> 38:26.321
Is that what you've told your parents?

38:28.680 --> 38:30.489
- Yeah.
- But it's not true.

38:30.560 --> 38:33.882
- Yeah, it is.
- No, Nathan. It's not.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.449
Don't ask me how I know your name.

38:36.520 --> 38:40.047
I know it the same way
I know that you are lying to me.

38:41.160 --> 38:43.049
Are you from the future?

38:43.320 --> 38:45.004
You clearly understand.

38:45.640 --> 38:48.246
So why aren't you
telling me what I need to know?

38:49.960 --> 38:52.770
That pin thing, it stopped working.

38:52.840 --> 38:54.729
She went to find another one.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.246
Nathan, where is she looking?

39:04.320 --> 39:10.168
<i>That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.</i>

39:26.000 --> 39:27.126
Hello?

39:27.920 --> 39:31.766
Sale this week.
Front three shelves. 70% off.

39:31.840 --> 39:34.047
No, thanks.
I'm not here to buy anything.

39:35.920 --> 39:38.321
I was hoping that
you could tell me about this.

39:42.880 --> 39:43.927
Hugo!

39:45.480 --> 39:46.686
Hugo!

39:47.080 --> 39:48.127
One second.

39:49.960 --> 39:53.043
Welcome to Blast From The...

39:56.320 --> 39:57.606
Thank you for the help, dear.

39:57.680 --> 39:59.364
Well, if you just kept it open,
you wouldn't need my help.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.442
If I kept it open, it would ruin the effect,
which is everything.

40:01.520 --> 40:03.409
Pardon my wife.
She has no respect for showmanship.

40:03.480 --> 40:06.006
- Hugo Gernsback. How may I help you?
- She has a pin.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.169
She has a pin.

40:09.560 --> 40:11.130
I saw that you were
looking for one online...

40:11.200 --> 40:13.931
- Where did you get it?
- What can you tell me about it?

40:14.000 --> 40:16.526
I can't tell you anything about it
unless you tell me who gave it to you.

40:16.640 --> 40:17.971
I'm not going first.

40:19.760 --> 40:22.001
Well, it seems
our business here is done.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.085
It seems it is.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.289
Saw something, didn't you?

40:34.720 --> 40:36.529
When you touched it.

40:38.320 --> 40:40.368
Something incredible.

40:43.360 --> 40:45.761
- It's real?
- Of course it is.

40:45.880 --> 40:47.211
Don't ask me how.

40:47.280 --> 40:48.840
These people have
developed technologies

40:48.880 --> 40:50.564
we haven't even dreamed of yet.

40:50.760 --> 40:53.161
Wait. What people?

40:58.240 --> 41:00.891
Have you ever wondered
what would happen

41:00.960 --> 41:04.760
if all the geniuses,
the artists, the scientists,

41:04.840 --> 41:08.640
the smartest,
most creative people in the world,

41:08.720 --> 41:11.564
decided to actually change it?

41:13.040 --> 41:14.405
But where?

41:14.960 --> 41:16.849
Where could they
even do such a thing?

41:16.920 --> 41:20.367
They'd need a place
free from politics and bureaucracy,

41:20.440 --> 41:22.807
distractions, greed.

41:22.880 --> 41:26.202
A secret place where they could build

41:26.280 --> 41:29.045
whatever they were
crazy enough to imagine.

41:29.360 --> 41:32.170
"Plus Ultra" they call themselves.

41:32.240 --> 41:36.404
The only way to see it, however,
is through contact with one of these.

41:36.480 --> 41:38.244
Why did they make them?
What are they for?

41:39.440 --> 41:40.965
Rumor has it

41:41.040 --> 41:43.122
- they were about to go public.
- Yeah.

41:43.280 --> 41:45.681
Share what they had built
with the whole world.

41:45.760 --> 41:48.923
Unfortunately, that never happened.

41:50.160 --> 41:51.321
Why not?

41:52.160 --> 41:54.970
I think we've shared enough,
young lady.

41:57.360 --> 42:01.001
So, as we've decided to trust you,

42:01.120 --> 42:05.648
please trust us
and tell me where'd you get it?

42:07.720 --> 42:08.721
I don't know.

42:09.520 --> 42:10.851
What do you mean, honey?

42:12.440 --> 42:15.762
I kind of got arrested
and it was in with my stuff.

42:16.200 --> 42:19.727
- In with your stuff?
- Yeah, I don't know how it got there.

42:22.280 --> 42:23.486
What was that?

42:23.600 --> 42:27.366
- Tell us who gave it to you. Please.
- No one gave it to me!

42:29.280 --> 42:31.203
That's very unlikely, sweetheart.

42:33.040 --> 42:34.371
You know what?

42:35.040 --> 42:38.283
I think I'm gonna go now.
Thanks for your help.

42:39.080 --> 42:41.287
$1,000 if you tell me
where you acquired the pin.

42:41.360 --> 42:42.407
I don't know!

42:42.480 --> 42:44.482
- $10,000.
- Was it a girl? A little girl?

42:44.560 --> 42:46.369
I don't know
what you guys are talking about.

42:46.440 --> 42:48.408
Have a nice day. Enjoy your freak out.

42:49.600 --> 42:51.921
Tell us where she is
and you will be spared.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.445
This is a joke, right?

43:01.640 --> 43:02.971
Where's the girl?

43:06.120 --> 43:08.487
I don't... I don't know about...

43:39.640 --> 43:42.166
You will tell us about the girl.

43:42.240 --> 43:45.005
I don't know any girl. I told you...

43:45.680 --> 43:48.923
- Where is the girl?
- I don't know any girl!

44:02.040 --> 44:03.041
We have to go!

44:05.160 --> 44:06.650
Come on. Now!

44:08.040 --> 44:10.691
This is a time bomb.
It stops time, but not for long!

44:10.800 --> 44:13.041
- What?
- Listen to me.

44:13.120 --> 44:16.647
The sphere is collapsing
and you're in the line of fire.

44:16.720 --> 44:19.849
We need to go or you will die.

44:22.160 --> 44:23.605
I'm stuck!

44:24.200 --> 44:26.885
- I'm stuck!
- But only temporarily.

44:27.040 --> 44:30.328
Take my hand. The moment you're free,
I'll pull you clear.

44:30.400 --> 44:31.845
Then stay behind me.

44:32.160 --> 44:33.207
Ready?

44:50.280 --> 44:51.281
The girl.

45:30.760 --> 45:31.841
Look out!

45:42.280 --> 45:43.361
We have to go.

45:44.160 --> 45:46.845
They're about to self-destruct.
We have to go now!

45:47.920 --> 45:51.288
Crazy enough to imagine.
Crazy enough to imagine.

46:03.560 --> 46:04.766
Casey, get up.

46:05.480 --> 46:07.005
They'll be coming.

46:07.080 --> 46:08.889
What? Who?

46:11.720 --> 46:14.121
- I don't know what... I can't get into...
- I know, I know.

46:14.200 --> 46:15.850
Get in the car, Casey!

46:17.360 --> 46:19.010
How do you know my name?

46:19.360 --> 46:21.044
Just get in the car.

46:35.600 --> 46:36.761
What just happened?

46:36.840 --> 46:39.320
Two AA units targeted you
for extermination.

46:39.440 --> 46:41.807
I saved your life. They self-destructed.

46:41.880 --> 46:42.881
Wait. "AAs"?

46:43.440 --> 46:44.680
Audio-Animatronics.

46:44.840 --> 46:48.890
- They were robots?
- No. Advanced anthropomo...

46:51.560 --> 46:54.291
Sure. Okay. Robots.

46:55.120 --> 46:56.929
Wait, wait. Who are you?

46:57.760 --> 47:01.207
My name is Athena.
I'm the one who gave you the pin.

47:01.520 --> 47:03.648
The pin? The pin!

47:03.840 --> 47:06.207
Yes. And I do wish you hadn't run off

47:06.280 --> 47:09.284
before I had a chance to give you
some rather necessary context.

47:09.360 --> 47:11.727
Context? What are you
even talking about?

47:11.800 --> 47:14.485
How are you driving a car?
Who are you?

47:14.840 --> 47:16.763
<i>I'm a cruder.</i>

47:17.240 --> 47:21.165
<i>Re... I'm a recruton.</i>

47:28.480 --> 47:30.209
<i>60 seconds to self-destruct.</i>

47:36.200 --> 47:38.043
So sorry about that.

47:38.200 --> 47:42.524
- You're one of them?
- Obviously.

47:50.160 --> 47:53.881
Where are you going?
Stop! I'm trying to help you!

48:00.080 --> 48:01.730
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

48:15.200 --> 48:16.247
Hey!

48:17.640 --> 48:18.687
Hey!

48:28.480 --> 48:31.563
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

48:34.480 --> 48:35.970
No way!

48:47.800 --> 48:50.565
- Let me out of this car!
- Stop yelling!

48:50.680 --> 48:53.251
- Let me out now!
- No! I will not!

48:53.320 --> 48:55.687
I gave you my very last pin, young lady,

48:55.760 --> 48:57.842
and I am not about to let it go to waste.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.367
What do you mean your last pin?

49:03.720 --> 49:06.530
Wait, that place I saw...

49:09.080 --> 49:11.970
- It exists?
- Of course it does.

49:12.720 --> 49:16.361
But if you don't come with me,
it won't for much longer.

49:17.960 --> 49:19.041
Why not?

49:19.120 --> 49:21.040
Because they built something
they shouldn't have.

49:22.040 --> 49:23.929
Built what?

49:24.240 --> 49:25.924
Do you want to keep
asking me questions

49:26.000 --> 49:28.731
- until someone arrives to murder us?
- No.

49:29.320 --> 49:31.607
Then which way do you want to go?

49:32.480 --> 49:36.201
Backwards or forwards?

49:37.680 --> 49:40.251
- And you can take me there?
- I can.

49:43.920 --> 49:45.001
I'm driving.

49:47.040 --> 49:49.884
Okie-dokie.
You fellas are released. Thanks.

49:51.520 --> 49:52.965
Alrighty, boys.

49:54.760 --> 49:57.843
Fire chief says
we're clear to go in and poke around.

49:57.920 --> 49:59.331
Hopefully, they were out for lunch

49:59.400 --> 50:01.482
and nobody was in
there when she went boom.

50:01.680 --> 50:02.727
Captain.

50:08.320 --> 50:11.051
Afternoon, sir.
Dave Clark, Secret Service.

50:14.520 --> 50:16.522
Looks like you got
yourself a doozy here.

50:16.600 --> 50:19.331
Secret Service?
Hey, where are they going?

50:19.400 --> 50:20.600
They're securing the premises.

50:20.640 --> 50:23.928
Thanks so much for your help,
but we're going to take it from here.

50:25.400 --> 50:28.563
Hey, Dale.
I found this just outside the window.

50:30.160 --> 50:31.889
You ever seen anything like it?

50:33.360 --> 50:34.885
What the hell?

50:35.520 --> 50:36.806
God almighty!

50:36.880 --> 50:39.645
<i>Sale. This week. 70 perce...</i>

50:39.920 --> 50:43.447
<i>Was it a girl? A little girl?
Was it a girl? A little girl?</i>

50:45.320 --> 50:47.641
You wanna tell me
what's going on here, son?

50:47.720 --> 50:49.961
No, sir. I do not.

50:55.080 --> 50:56.650
<i>Was it a girl? A little girl?</i>

50:57.160 --> 50:58.924
Contact Governor Nix.

51:00.320 --> 51:01.970
Tell him we found the girl.

51:02.640 --> 51:03.641
Veer left!

51:05.160 --> 51:07.128
Little more of a heads up next time.

51:07.280 --> 51:09.760
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't you
just tell me where we're going?

51:09.840 --> 51:12.844
- Pittsfield, New York.
- What's in Pittsfield, New York?

51:13.560 --> 51:14.971
Someone who can get us back in.

51:15.440 --> 51:18.444
Hold on.
You said that you gave me your last pin.

51:18.520 --> 51:20.329
How many other people
did you give them to?

51:20.400 --> 51:21.401
Not important.

51:22.200 --> 51:23.645
I'm not even your first choice.

51:24.440 --> 51:26.522
I only found you
a month ago when you started

51:26.640 --> 51:28.847
wantonly destroying
government property.

51:28.920 --> 51:30.001
Which happens to go

51:30.080 --> 51:31.844
on my search parameters
for recruitment.

51:32.520 --> 51:36.969
Not to mention you scored a 73
on the Feynman/Drummelberg scale.

51:37.040 --> 51:39.725
73? Is that good?

51:39.880 --> 51:42.281
Wait. Hold on. Recruitment for what?

51:42.440 --> 51:43.805
I'm not allowed to answer that.

51:43.880 --> 51:45.166
Who's not allowing you?

51:45.240 --> 51:47.607
I'm not allowed to answer that.
And I should warn you,

51:47.680 --> 51:51.241
you keep asking me questions, and my
Countermeasure Protocol will initiate.

51:51.320 --> 51:55.086
- Okay. And what does that mean?
- I will shut down.

51:55.600 --> 51:58.524
- You will not.
- Try me.

52:02.320 --> 52:05.847
You said that they built
something they shouldn't have.

52:05.920 --> 52:08.764
Did something happen over there?
Something bad?

52:10.240 --> 52:11.287
Son of a...

52:27.240 --> 52:29.402
Please don't answer.
Please don't answer.

52:31.480 --> 52:33.482
<i>Hey, you've reached
Eddie Newton's cell phone.</i>

52:33.560 --> 52:36.086
<i>Leave me a message
and I will call you back.</i>

52:37.080 --> 52:38.923
Hey, Dad. It's Casey.

52:40.760 --> 52:43.923
I told Nate to tell you that I was
camping, but I'm not camping.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.048
And I just don't like lying to you.

52:47.240 --> 52:50.050
But I didn't know
how to tell you the truth because...

52:52.520 --> 52:56.286
Something highly unusual
is happening, and...

52:57.400 --> 52:58.890
Okay. My point is...

52:59.760 --> 53:02.730
<i>I'm fine. I will continue to be fine.</i>

53:03.000 --> 53:06.288
<i>I'm not on drugs. I haven't joined a cult.</i>

53:06.440 --> 53:07.726
<i>I won't be gone long.</i>

53:08.680 --> 53:12.480
<i>And I will call again soon.
I love you, Dad.</i>

53:18.160 --> 53:20.731
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

53:20.920 --> 53:22.968
Yes. Fine, thank you.

53:23.760 --> 53:26.286
I thought I broke you or something.

53:31.120 --> 53:32.121
I should drive.

53:33.320 --> 53:36.802
Casey, I know you have
no reason to trust me.

53:36.880 --> 53:40.487
But I've been looking for someone
like you for a very long time.

53:41.440 --> 53:42.441
Now, please,

53:44.360 --> 53:45.441
pull over.

53:56.040 --> 53:58.930
Of all the people
you could give one of those pins to,

54:01.520 --> 54:02.681
Why me?

54:03.480 --> 54:04.845
Because you're special.

54:05.520 --> 54:09.206
- Yeah. I'm special.
- You are.

54:17.920 --> 54:19.922
So, this guy we're gonna go see,

54:21.560 --> 54:23.130
what's his name?

54:25.600 --> 54:27.011
His name is Frank.

54:28.560 --> 54:30.403
<i>Frank Walker.</i>

54:31.560 --> 54:33.210
He's special, too.

54:35.200 --> 54:37.407
Frank Walker.

55:03.480 --> 55:06.324
Hey! Wait, what are you doing?

55:12.400 --> 55:13.890
Just great.

56:23.040 --> 56:24.724
Where are your paw prints?

56:37.880 --> 56:40.167
That is cool.

57:10.600 --> 57:12.762
I can hear you, you know.

57:12.840 --> 57:15.366
Go away. Didn't you see the dog?

57:15.840 --> 57:18.207
Yeah. It's a hologram.

57:18.280 --> 57:20.282
How did you do that in daylight?

57:20.920 --> 57:22.763
- It's pretty impressive.
- Who are you?

57:22.840 --> 57:24.205
What do you want?

57:24.360 --> 57:26.203
You're Frank Walker, right?

57:27.200 --> 57:31.091
My name's Casey,
and I want you to take me there.

57:31.920 --> 57:33.888
Take you where?

57:35.040 --> 57:37.520
To the place I saw when I touched this.

57:53.560 --> 57:54.846
Where'd you get this?

57:55.960 --> 57:58.247
A little girl. Athena.

57:58.960 --> 58:00.086
Where is she?

58:00.560 --> 58:01.891
She ditched me here.

58:03.800 --> 58:05.325
Of course she did.

58:05.400 --> 58:08.722
Look, wherever you came from, kid,
go back.

58:09.160 --> 58:11.891
No, I want you to take me there.
What I saw...

58:11.960 --> 58:14.247
What you saw is gone.

58:15.360 --> 58:18.284
This, what you're looking for,
it doesn't exist anymore.

58:18.360 --> 58:22.365
No. I feel like I have to go.
Like I'm supposed to go.

58:22.440 --> 58:23.680
Why?

58:23.760 --> 58:27.003
Because they're saving
a seat on the rocket ship just for you?

58:29.080 --> 58:32.687
What you saw was a commercial
that was recorded decades ago.

58:32.920 --> 58:36.686
It was an invitation that never went out
because the damn party got canceled.

58:37.480 --> 58:39.847
You are not supposed to do anything.

58:40.440 --> 58:44.365
You've been manipulated to feel
like you're part of something incredible.

58:45.120 --> 58:46.531
Like you were special.

58:47.320 --> 58:48.446
But you weren't.

58:50.320 --> 58:51.321
You're not.

58:54.280 --> 58:55.441
So that's a no?

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:13.087
Son of a...

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.331
You little...

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.887
<i>You know, I can call the cops anytime.</i>

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.240
Anytime!

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.765
You have...
I'm giving you five seconds...

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.922
I am not leaving!

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.367
Either tell me how to
get there or kill me!

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:15.849
If you touch anything in there,
that's exactly what I'll do!

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.606
What are you doing?

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.728
I'm touching things!

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.888
Open this door now!

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:31.286
I mean it. I'll knock you out.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.446
Hey, what's this doohickey
with the trombone slidey thing?

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.363
Leave that alone. I'm serious!

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.207
- Will you take me there?
- No!

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.009
Then you're not serious!

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.281
Come on.

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.125
You didn't think that was funny?

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.009
You're recording this?

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.641
If I get you to laugh, I wanna, you know,
have it for posterity.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:02.720
I laughed.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.121
You smiled. A smile's not a laugh.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:08.410
Everyone laughs. It's a biological need.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:11.723
Actually, it isn't.
Sleep is a biological need.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.802
I've never seen you sleep, either.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.766
Well, sooner or later,
I'm gonna make you laugh.

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:21.880
Until you do, I'm not gonna stop trying.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.004
Maybe you should.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:26.321
What?

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.764
Stop trying.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:32.766
Why?

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.644
Must we record this?

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:37.890
- Get out!
- Wait a second.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.809
What is that? Is that a countdown?

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.241
I am not leaving. I deserve to
know what's going on around here.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:44.209
- You deserve...
- Yeah, I deserve some answers.

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.044
- Answers to what?
- I know that you were there.

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.246
You don't know anything.

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.970
How do you ever
leave a place like that?

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.371
Because they threw me out!

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:59.922
They threw me out
and they locked every door back in.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:06.241
Was it because you built
that something that you shouldn't have?

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.606
Who told you that?

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.361
And is that it?

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:12.284
The "something"?

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.283
If I could tell you the date,

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:21.009
the exact date that you're gonna die,
would you wanna know?

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.726
- How would you know?
- Let's just say I did.

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.564
- What are you, a psychic?
- No, that's not the point.

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.880
Then what is your basis for knowing?

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.405
- It's a hypothetical.
- It's a stupid hypothetical.

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:31.006
Just use your imagination. All right?

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.200
- All right.
- Okay.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.370
Let's accept that there is a world

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:40.685
where I know, with absolute certainty,
the exact time of your death.

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.961
Now, you want me to tell you or not?

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.643
Yeah, of course I would. Who wouldn't?

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:54.282
But what if accepting my death
is what causes it?

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.963
So the answer is yes.
I would want you to tell me.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.768
- But I wouldn't believe you.
- You have to believe me.

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:03.650
Why? Don't we, like,
make our own destiny and stuff?

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.646
What?

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.331
Who are you, kid?

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.285
Is that bad?

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.567
Hell.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:33.841
Hell!

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.970
- They followed you here?
- What? Who?

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:49.681
Robots.

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:52.445
I've never seen them before.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.203
<i>John Francis Walker.</i>

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.361
<i>You have been permitted to live</i>

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.408
<i>based upon your
agreed non-intervention.</i>

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.801
<i>You are now harboring
a fugitive element.</i>

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:03.201
<i>Release her to our custody
or be extinguished.</i>

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.802
<i>You have one minute to comply.</i>

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.245
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me yet.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.287
Wait.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:51.801
Come on!

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:15.767
Let's go!

01:08:22.279 --> 01:08:24.930
John Francis Walker,
by authority of Governor Nix,

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.444
this unit has been authorized

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:27.760
<i>to extinguish your life.</i>

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.326
Okay.

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:38.960
Okay.

01:08:41.279 --> 01:08:43.442
All right, that's enough. That's enough!

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.929
Come on. Close the door.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.764
Who the hell is Governor Nix?

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:54.770
Let's go. Come on.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.051
Get in.

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.090
How is this a good idea?

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:36.770
Move or sink, kid.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:38.968
You were actually prepared for that?

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.448
- My hat.
- Leave it.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.130
No, no, no. I can't go without it.

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.121
It's my dad's.

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:03.484
Now I get it.

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.802
Too smart for your own good.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:10.367
Father never understood you,
never supported you.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:15.287
And now you wear
his hat as a badge of rebellion, right?

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.961
No. My dad is amazing.

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.688
Wait a second.

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.643
We're not talking about me, are we?

01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:33.325
Why don't we just get you
to your amazing dad

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:34.811
and pretend this never happened?

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:36.801
Hop on.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:41.404
- The battery's dead.
- No, it's not.

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:43.926
- Then maybe it's the points.
- No, it's not.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.368
- When's the last time you checked...
- You know, you're not helping. You...

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:50.685
Get down. Now.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:06.601
Wait.

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:10.921
Hello, Frank.

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:20.284
Are you going to shoot me?

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.290
- I'm deciding.
- Could you decide in the truck?

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.203
Because we really should get going.

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.522
- Wait.
- Why? So more robots can show up?

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.406
She's one of them.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:38.329
Yeah, I know. Are you coming or not?

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:46.410
Move over.

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:08.284
- Frank...
- Not yet.

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:12.451
What are you thinking?
Why would you drag her into this?

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:16.161
I didn't drag her into anything.
I gave her a pin.

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:17.571
She did the rest.

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.521
Just like you.

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:23.127
Don't even.
Where did you even find the pin?

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:24.690
I was there. They destroyed 'em.

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:27.843
Not all of them.
I made it out with nearly a dozen.

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:29.365
So you give one to a teenager.

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:32.842
Hey, I got a 73 on the
Feinberg/Dusseldorf scale or whatever.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.207
You got a 73?
That's not possible.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.521
He's jealous because he scored a 41.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.683
You know what? I was 11. I was 11!

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.122
Hey, don't touch that!

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:47.683
This is a one-kiloton detonation.
It is not a toy.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.007
Do not mess with my stuff.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:51.206
- You got it?
- Sorry!

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:53.851
I didn't begin with her, you know.

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:56.730
I wasted years
on other potential candidates.

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.450
Potential candidates? For what?

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:02.120
That's beautiful.

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:04.487
You still think
you're recruiting, don't you?

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.164
Do not ask her any more questions.

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.049
She's gonna do her
countermeasure shutdown thing.

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.520
What countermeasure shutdown thing?

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.369
Did you tell her you had
a countermeasure shutdown thing?

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:15.047
- She was annoying me.
- You lied?

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:16.491
Get used to that, kid.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.560
One minute,
she's promising you a beautiful future,

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.365
the next thing you know,
she's leading it to your house to kill you.

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.410
I'm sorry, but time is running out
and you needed motivation.

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.527
Motivation for what?

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:29.005
- We need to go back over, Frank.
- Back over there?

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.244
Yes, yes, Frank,
we need to go back over.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:32.845
Good. Great. That's just great.

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:36.567
You know, hey, I got stung by a bee.
Let's jump on the hive.

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.330
That's a terrible analogy.

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:41.085
That's a fantastic analogy.
What do you know about analogies?

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.401
You know, you're impossible to talk
to when you're like this.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:46.922
I am like this because
you derailed my life.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.081
Again.

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:50.640
Frank, it's not personal.

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.641
It's just programming.

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.007
We're here!

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:04.601
Where are you going?

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:07.684
This is where
your wire station's located, isn't it?

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.444
We need to get to The Spectacle.

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.887
- Spectacle?
- Hey. Are you insane?

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:14.440
They know that you sent her to me.
They're gonna be waiting for us.

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:17.364
Fine. Give me the Edison tube
and we'll go without you.

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:20.489
- I don't have the Edison tube.
- It's in your bag.

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.049
I have x-ray vision.

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:26.010
- When did you get x-ray vision?
- She's full of surprises.

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.445
I know all about her surprises.

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:30.763
Chief among them is this.
She doesn't care about you.

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:35.246
All that charm and the sense
of purpose, and the cute little smile,

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:36.970
it's all just software.

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.407
It's ones and zeroes. That's it.

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.570
Trust me, when you get there,
you're on your own.

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:48.008
- What happened to you two?
- He thinks I hurt him.

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:51.562
No, you hurt a dumb kid
that was stupid enough to fall...

01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:58.683
You were many things, Frank Walker.

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.484
But you were never dumb.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.729
Why don't you just give me
the Edison tube, and...

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:12.882
I'm not giving you anything. I'm...

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.445
All right.

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:23.330
You want in? I'll bring you in.

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:24.845
Why not?

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.809
It's better than waiting
around here and getting

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.848
hunted and killed, etcetera, etcetera.

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:32.487
- That's the spirit.
- "Etcetera"? What's the "etcetera"?

01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:59.729
- What kind of cables are these?
- The kind that transmit people.

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.406
People? Like us?

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:04.724
- What, like a miniature teleport...
- Do I have to explain everything?

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:08.562
Can't you just be amazed and move on?

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.325
This is all wired to the dish up there.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:16.643
Are you... Are you using satellite?

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:20.411
I know how things work.

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.050
Well, zippity-doo for you.

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:28.322
- Wrap this around your eyes, tight.
- Why?

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.402
Because justice is blind.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.522
Just do it, kid.

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:37.364
You want me to put this over my head?

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.090
If this takes off my eyebrows...

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:42.242
Shut up, open your mouth,
tilt your head back.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.851
What is that?

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.569
It's powder. Are we at van 't Hoff?

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:49.565
Good to go!

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:53.531
Good. You set it for the Tower?
There is still a receiver there?

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.728
- Last I checked.
- How long ago was that?

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:00.886
25 years ago.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.400
Roughly.

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:10.847
They threw you out, too?

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:14.881
Okay, guys. Killer robots.

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:17.001
All right.

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:19.765
It's gonna be
bright, cold, and really loud.

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:22.411
You're gonna lose
90% of your blood sugar

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:23.720
in 1/100th of a second

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.724
and you're gonna wish you were dead.
But then it'll be over.

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:29.765
Don't pee on us.

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:32.081
This sounds spectacular.

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.288
Why now? Why her?

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.089
Because she hasn't given up.

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.810
You think she can fix it.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.809
What makes you say that?

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:47.926
Can she, Athena?

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.046
I have no idea.

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:53.569
Let's go find out.

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.362
Is it... Is this normal?

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:31.371
Thirsty.

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.727
Dying. I think I'm dying.

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.882
- You're not dying!
- I'm dying.

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.724
There's Coke in the fridge.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.331
Help yourself.

01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:00.411
We have no idea how many are here

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:01.925
but we're damn sure
they know we're coming.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.048
So, we move quickly. You follow me.

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.009
No questions. Got it?

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.321
Got it.

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:17.921
Excuse me.

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:43.283
- We're in Paris?
- Would you stop being so amazed?

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:46.569
- I thought you wanted me to be amazed.
- I want you to stop yammer...

01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:55.170
- Tower's closing.
- Hell.

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:01.921
Come on.

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:04.602
Now, you and I are gonna be
on a watch list,

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:07.763
but they may not have your facial
recognition profile uploaded yet.

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:08.966
- "May not"?
- May not.

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:12.442
So, you walk over there,
you take this, you tap him on the neck.

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:15.569
- If he's human, it knocks him right out.
- And if it's a robot?

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.722
- Hey!
- You'll just piss it off.

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:20.446
Fantastic.

01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:25.962
She's got guts. You gotta give her that.

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:30.567
Yes, but I was just, you know...

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.411
Human!

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:53.480
The French hated
this thing when Eiffel first unveiled it

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:54.851
at the Paris World's Fair.

01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:56.445
They thought it was an eyesore.

01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:59.364
Eiffel didn't care, though.
It wasn't meant to be a monument.

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:00.840
It was meant to find another world.

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:05.685
<i>Les Quatre Premiers.</i>
Plus Ultra's First Four.

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.205
They were a part of all this?

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:12.081
Eiffel, Jules Verne, Tesla,
and Mr. Edison.

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:15.326
They designed this antenna
that we're inside.

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.289
Wait, what?
The Eiffel Tower is an antenna?

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.203
Now I finally answer your question,
you're gonna interrupt me?

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:20.721
Yes.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:24.122
Tesla designed the antenna to observe
every kind of frequency out there.

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.646
Subspace, trans-dimensional,
you name it.

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:29.405
And they found exactly
what they were looking for.

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:31.323
And then Edison tried
to take credit for it,

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:32.640
because these two hate each other.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:34.051
- Frank...
- Because of alternating...

01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:35.485
Stay on topic.

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:37.325
Yeah. All right, well...

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:42.850
There were always rumors
of a secret entrance

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:45.486
the Four kept just for themselves.

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:51.004
A one-way ticket
in case of emergencies.

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:56.681
The Spectacle.

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:31.364
You ain't seen nothing yet, kid.

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:38.605
It's a rocket.

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:44.446
They're coming.

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:46.607
All right.

01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:06.200
Buckle up!

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:26.246
- What'd he say?
- Pretty much what you'd expect.

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:27.606
Tell him to hang on.

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.486
Why are we going back?

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:44.121
We're not. We're going through
to another dimension.

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:47.164
So we blasted into outer space
just to get a running start?

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:49.563
This part may get a little weird.

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:48.126
<i>Casey. Wake up.</i>

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.249
Casey.

01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:57.126
- Casey. Wake up.
- We're here.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.161
Now what?

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:47.726
You tell me.

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:51.849
- I tell you? This was your idea.
- I don't have ideas.

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:54.169
I just find the people who do.

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:55.924
- So there's no plan?
- There's a plan.

01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:57.690
You just haven't come up with it yet.

01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:00.842
But you should do that soon.

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:06.809
That's just terrific.

01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:08.721
Here, hide this.

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:11.765
Absolutely.

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:14.002
Wait. Is that
the one-kiloton detonation thingy

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.366
you told me not to play with?

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:16.771
Right now, it's our insurance policy.

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:19.241
There's a good chance they're gonna
try to kill us right out of the gate.

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:21.482
So we're just gonna stand here?

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:24.291
Well, you wanted to see Tomorrowland.

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:26.645
Here it comes.

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:54.200
Take the bag.

01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:02.681
- Frank.
- David.

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:04.561
You look well.

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.246
Age becomes you.

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:08.091
Thanks. You should try it.

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:11.685
I don't know. I think I'll just keep
drinking my shake every morning.

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:14.447
- Comes in chocolate now.
- Yum.

01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:19.566
Hello, Athena.

01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:21.840
I started to think
you were never coming home.

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:24.650
Where, oh, where have you been?

01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:27.641
Your job?

01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:29.645
I'm sorry. Were we not clear

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:31.888
when we suspended
your recruitment protocols?

01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:34.566
I got that sense when you
called me "bloody obsolete"

01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:36.125
and tried to disassemble me.

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:40.291
Well, you've certainly
caused quite a commotion

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:43.921
by launching an antique rocket ship
out of the Eiffel Tower.

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.164
Under normal circumstances,

01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:50.642
we'd be working overtime to convince
everyone it was just an elaborate hoax.

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:54.930
Fortunately, for all of us,
doesn't really matter now, does it?

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:56.646
Why doesn't it matter?

01:29:58.600 --> 01:29:59.931
And who might you be?

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:04.120
I'm Casey. Newton.

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:07.689
And who might you be?

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:10.005
David Nix.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.047
Pleasure.

01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:15.047
Well, Frank, it's been
wonderful catching up,

01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:18.363
but as we were fairly clear
about the terms of your exile

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:20.488
and the consequences of violating it,

01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:23.649
I have to ask
what the hell are you doing here?

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:25.245
I think she can fix it.

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:31.088
- I'm sorry.
- Her.

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:34.125
- I think she can fix it, David.
- Wait. What?

01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:35.480
I've been pirating your signal.

01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:38.410
Every time you turn it on here,
I can see it there.

01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:40.164
And it flickered.

01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:42.242
The percentage dropped, David.

01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:44.241
Impossible.

01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:46.640
You don't believe me?
Let's go find out right now.

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:50.606
- I'm sorry, what can I fix?
- The world, Miss Newton.

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:54.520
He thinks you can fix the world.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.571
Is that like a portal to Earth?

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:23.925
No. it is a bridgeway to Earth.

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:32.400
Welcome back to The Monitor, Frank.

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:35.364
It's something, isn't it?

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:37.600
Yeah, it's something.

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:56.283
Don't worry about the light show.

01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.125
It's perfectly safe.

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:03.441
Am I supposed to do something?

01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:05.804
Okay, could you be a bit more specific?

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:07.560
Because fixing
the world sounds a little...

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:09.250
Just be yourself.

01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:11.611
Gotcha.

01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:16.084
Flashes of the future.

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:19.643
- What are those?
- Flashes of future.

01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:22.209
This is us a few seconds from now.

01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:26.771
This whole tower
funnels energy via tachyon,

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:29.207
a particle that
moves significantly faster than light.

01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:31.931
We discovered them
almost 40 years ago.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.083
Your physicists
are still arguing over whether they exist.

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:36.241
Oh, dear.

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:38.327
Too late.

01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:39.925
Oh, dear.

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:41.481
Too late.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.684
So, on with the show.

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:03.128
We've enhanced
the interface significantly

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:06.010
but it still functions
on your original algorithm.

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.682
You have something
to show me, Frank?

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:11.561
Show me.

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:24.726
Pick a place.

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:28.168
- What?
- A location anywhere in the world.

01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:29.366
Pick one.

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:32.281
Canaveral.

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:34.851
Cape Canaveral.

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:50.046
Easy, easy.

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:54.964
The interface is oriented from
your hands to the center of the Earth.

01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:57.482
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:04.245
You trained her obviously.

01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:06.570
I just met her yesterday.

01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:08.970
She knows how things work.

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:16.928
<i>You told me this story my entire life,
and now I'm telling you.</i>

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.490
How is this possible?

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:21.325
We are millions
of exponential deviances

01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:23.846
Away from the dimension you call home.

01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:26.321
Frank had the novel idea
of building this machine

01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:28.721
so that we could keep in touch.

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:31.645
This is three days ago.

01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:33.525
Relatively.

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:37.241
That's space/time humor.

01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:43.203
Because tachyons
travel faster than light,

01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:44.685
once we harness them...

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:46.649
You can see backwards in time.

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:48.966
Not just backwards.

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:52.401
You're kidding.

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:54.601
No.

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.925
What happened?

01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:22.400
Keep going.

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:24.924
Just a little further.

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:12.647
That's enough.

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:16.251
That's enough, kid.

01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:23.326
That's my house.

01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:27.888
It would have been nice if Frank
had prepared you for this,

01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:30.926
but I'm afraid the world is ending.

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:36.161
It is certain, it is unavoidable,
and it is coming.

01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:37.881
When?

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:41.204
This is 58 days from now.

01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:43.929
58 days?

01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:48.047
But whatever caused this could happen
any time after the static starts.

01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:49.804
It could be a month.

01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:51.370
It could be sooner.

01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:02.568
Still looking for your flicker, Frank?

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:04.561
I know what I saw.

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:09.006
So why aren't you telling anyone?

01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:13.563
The whole planet is gonna die
and you're just sitting here?

01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:15.611
We're not gonna die.

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.004
This is your world, not ours.

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:20.084
We'll be perfectly fine here.

01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:22.527
Then why don't you let people in?

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:26.604
- Tell her, David.
- Frank.

01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:31.242
All those years in exile,
and you still don't understand.

01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:33.926
These people are driven by savagery.

01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:36.886
If we told them about this place,

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:41.368
then that would happen here to us.

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:42.771
Then nothing would survive.

01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:45.281
But it hasn't happened yet!

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.886
Actually, it has happened.
You just haven't accepted it.

01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:49.291
Well, I don't accept it!

01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:58.967
Did you see that? Did you see that?

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.690
David, I know that you saw that.

01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:03.331
That means that there is a chance.
There's at least a chance...

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:13.049
That went quite well, don't you think?

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:15.851
- What happened?
- You're being deported.

01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:18.571
Again.

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:21.406
Well, that's Nix for you.

01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:23.721
No new ideas.

01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:27.202
Apparently, your
1/10,000 variable in the Inevitability

01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:29.851
wasn't convincing enough
to change his mind.

01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:36.965
Be gentle.

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.245
You okay?

01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:53.008
You know, you'd think
somewhere in the zillions

01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:56.607
of questions that I was asking you,
you could have said,

01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:58.762
"Casey, that stuff's not really the issue

01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:02.322
"because our future-predicting
machine says we're all gonna die."

01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:04.804
We did sort of hint at it.

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:07.201
This place has nothing to do with hope.

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:09.650
It's the opposite of hope.

01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:11.882
- Come on. Don't say that.
- Why not?

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:14.006
You said it.

01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:16.245
No wonder you gave up.

01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:18.529
That's before I knew about you.

01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:22.123
I mean, you really...
You really are special.

01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:24.282
Why do you people
keep saying that to me?

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.365
I'm not!

01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:34.724
Why'd you even give me this?

01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:38.530
You showed me a place
that was amazing and incredible

01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:40.409
and it was a lie.

01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:43.843
If you're gonna zap an idea
into people's heads,

01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:45.490
you should really make sure
that it's the truth.

01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:48.404
Because you can't do that.
You can't just zap...

01:39:58.400 --> 01:39:59.481
What?

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:02.204
Zap an idea into people's heads.

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:07.763
You were pirating the signal.

01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:09.330
- How?
- What?

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:11.681
At your house.
All your TVs, your doomsday room.

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:13.808
You were boosting
the feed from that Monitor thing.

01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:15.370
- How did you do that?
- No big deal.

01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:19.206
They're running so much power through
it now, a ham radio could pick it up.

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:21.487
It's just a matter of finding
the right frequency...

01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:25.123
You grabbed a signal
from another dimension.

01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:29.406
From a machine here.
That means it's transmitting there.

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:32.165
What if it's not just
predicting the future?

01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:34.211
It's broadcasting it.

01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:36.210
When I touched this thing

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:38.806
for a few minutes,
it felt like anything was possible.

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:41.400
So then why can't the opposite happen?

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:44.051
What if The Monitor is just a giant pin?

01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:45.884
But instead of making
you think positive,

01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:48.281
it makes you think negative and it...

01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:54.281
And it's convincing
the whole world to feed the wrong wolf.

01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:57.130
We need to turn that thing off.

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:04.166
It's time to go home.

01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:12.529
David. David.

01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:16.247
- It's uninhabited and uncharted.
- Listen to me.

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:19.085
But it looks like a lovely place
to spend your last days.

01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:21.401
David... The Monitor is
acting as an antenna.

01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:23.403
It isn't just receiving tachyons.

01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:25.528
It is taking a possible future and...

01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:28.610
And amplifying it,
transmitting it, like a feedback loop.

01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:31.763
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy
that's coming from right there.

01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:33.808
But it's not just
showing people the end of the world,

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:36.531
it's giving them the idea over and over
again until they just accept it!

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:39.080
It's a ticking time bomb,
and we're the ones that lit the fuse.

01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:42.004
We still have 58 days
to try and change things.

01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:44.606
But nothing will work
as long as that thing is still on.

01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:45.920
Young lady, I'm gonna assume

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.651
that your knowledge
of tachyonic fusion is a little sketchy.

01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:53.521
Shutting it down is impossible.
There is no off.

01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:56.761
I'm telling you what it's doing.

01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:58.609
Why don't you care?

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:01.010
Because he's the one that's doing it.

01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:08.880
Right?

01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:14.000
Let's imagine.

01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:19.964
If you glimpsed the future
and were frightened by what you saw,

01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:23.249
what would you do
with that information? You would go to...

01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:26.531
Who? Politicians?
Captains of industry?

01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:29.883
And how would you convince them?
With data? Facts?

01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:31.886
Good luck.

01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:33.769
The only facts they won't challenge

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:37.481
are the ones that keep the wheels
greased and the dollars rolling in.

01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:39.210
But what if...

01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:42.250
What if there was a way
of skipping the middleman

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:45.722
and putting the critical news
directly into everyone's head?

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:51.000
The probability of
widespread annihilation kept going up.

01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:54.243
The only way to stop it was to show it.

01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:56.170
To scare people straight.

01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:59.767
Because what reasonable
human being wouldn't be galvanized

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:01.001
by the potential destruction of

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:02.844
everything they have
ever known or loved?

01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:09.448
To save civilization,
I would show its collapse.

01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:13.526
But how do you think
this vision was received?

01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:17.966
How do you think people responded
to the prospect of imminent doom?

01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:21.243
They gobbled it up,
like a chocolate éclair.

01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:24.811
They didn't fear their demise,
they repackaged it.

01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:29.890
It can be enjoyed as video games,
as TV shows, books, movies.

01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:33.567
The entire world wholeheartedly
embraced the apocalypse

01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:36.007
and sprinted towards it
with gleeful abandon.

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:40.207
Meanwhile, your Earth
was crumbling all around you.

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:43.966
You've got simultaneous
epidemics of obesity and starvation.

01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:45.087
Explain that one.

01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:49.330
Bees and butterflies start to disappear.

01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:50.970
The glaciers melt.

01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:54.089
Algae blooms all around you.

01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:56.128
The coal mine canaries
are dropping dead,

01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:58.931
and you won't take the hint!

01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:03.606
In every moment,
there is the possibility of a better future.

01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:05.444
But you people won't believe it.

01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:06.646
And because you won't believe it,

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:09.764
you won't do what is necessary
to make it a reality.

01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:13.890
So you dwell on this terrible future,
and you resign yourselves to it.

01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:14.960
For one reason,

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.244
because that future doesn't
ask anything of you today.

01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:25.924
So, yes, we saw the iceberg,
we warned the <i>Titanic.</i>

01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:30.808
But you all just steered for it anyway,
full steam ahead.

01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:31.961
Why?

01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:35.362
Because you want to sink.

01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:38.530
You gave up.

01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:43.729
That's not The Monitor's fault.
That's yours.

01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:49.046
Put them through.

01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:55.044
Thanks for visiting, Frank.

01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:58.681
It was genuinely nice to see you again.

01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:10.529
- What are you doing?
- Not giving up.

01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:28.801
Look out!

01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:36.368
- Get the thing!
- What thing?

01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:39.205
The thing I gave you
when we first got here!

01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:43.282
Arm it! Get on the platform!

01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:52.641
Casey! The bomb!

01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:54.803
Get on the platform!

01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:15.490
- Now what?
- Arm it!

01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:16.800
How?

01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:45.040
Casey!

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:52.046
The bomb! Where is the bomb?

01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:15.561
<i>One minute to detonation.</i>

01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:21.006
<i>45 seconds.</i>

01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:24.129
Athena! The bomb.
What do I do? How do I turn it off?

01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:25.486
<i>30 seconds.</i>

01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:26.931
You can't.

01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:32.568
This is not funny!

01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:38.526
Frank, get out of there! It's gonna blow!

01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:40.921
Frank, get out!

01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:45.001
Get out of there!

01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:47.805
<i>- Four. Three.</i>
- Close the portal!

01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:49.564
<i>- Two. One.</i>
- Close the portal!

01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:21.841
- Are you all right?
- The bomb's gone.

01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:23.046
- Can you stand?
- Yeah.

01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:24.321
Frank!

01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:29.561
No.

01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:33.209
The bomb's gone.

01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:35.009
- Can you stand?
- Yeah.

01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:36.167
Frank!

01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:53.126
- What happened? Is she okay?
- I need to get her to a repair module.

01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:56.283
Frank! No one's going to repair me.

01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:58.491
Not in time.

01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:01.322
I need to tell you something now.

01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:09.926
Darn.

01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:12.650
I'm shutting down.

01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:15.200
<i>I'm shutting down.</i>

01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:18.970
I'm going to lose sync.

01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:22.084
Don't look at me like that.

01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:27.485
- If I lose sync, it's not failure.
- I know.

01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:32.245
There are things
I need to tell you before the final...

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:36.166
Before the automated program kicks in.

01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:38.644
I'm a machine.

01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:41.521
I never thought that was bad

01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:43.807
until I saw your face
when you found out I was.

01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:45.120
I always knew.

01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:47.840
No, you didn't.

01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:49.731
<i>Systems failing.</i>

01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:53.725
<i>Activating last thoughts
saved for Frank Walker.</i>

01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:59.361
<i>Log 15: September 1965.</i>

01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:04.085
<i>Frank Walker is looking at me in
a manner that is difficult to recognize.</i>

01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:08.243
<i>It seems imperative to explain to him
that I am an Audio-Animatronic...</i>

01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:09.401
Athena...

01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:13.567
<i>But I am concerned
that he may be adversely affected</i>

01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:15.881
<i>when he finds out that I am not human.</i>

01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:18.610
<i>He has potential.</i>

01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:20.410
<i>I don't want to damage it.</i>

01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:23.531
<i>He needs someone to believe in him.</i>

01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:25.762
<i>And I am fulfilling that need.</i>

01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:27.851
<i>He is my top recruit.</i>

01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:33.920
<i>Log 24, October 1965.</i>

01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:38.644
<i>I'm having unusual thoughts
towards Frank Walker.</i>

01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:42.249
<i>I suspect a flaw
in my empathy interface.</i>

01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:44.641
<i>I am thinking I should report it.</i>

01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:47.845
<i>But I haven't.</i>

01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:50.442
<i>I cannot explain why.</i>

01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:56.208
<i>Log 78, April 1984.</i>

01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:59.568
<i>Frank Walker has been banished
by Governor Nix.</i>

01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:01.290
<i>He says he has lost hope</i>

01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:05.126
<i>and he holds me responsible for
having given it to him in the first place.</i>

01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:07.369
<i>I do not understand this.</i>

01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:09.490
<i>He says I never will</i>

01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:14.171
<i>because I do not feel
anger or disappointment.</i>

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.331
<i>Or love.</i>

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:22.648
<i>End recording.</i>

01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:27.807
I was designed to find dreamers.

01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:29.891
I found you.

01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:34.930
And lost you.

01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:38.171
Till I found her.

01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:40.926
Casey.

01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:47.009
Dreamers need to stick together.

01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:51.730
It's not programming.

01:52:52.840 --> 01:52:54.205
It's personal.

01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:03.126
The Monitor.

01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:06.886
The bomb is gone. But I'm not, yet.

01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:08.969
There isn't much time.

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:11.247
My self-destruct, use it.

01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:14.646
You know what to do, Frank.

01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:17.891
Help get it right this time.

01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:22.964
I thought you can't have ideas.

01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:26.326
Well, what do you know?

01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:30.765
What do you know?

01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:35.564
Systems failing.

01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:19.449
- Frank?
- Yeah?

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:23.770
Do you want to know
why you could never make me laugh?

01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:27.281
Why?

01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:30.569
Because you're not funny.

01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:44.923
You can let me go now.

01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:53.485
Goodbye, Frank.

01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:03.811
Goodbye, Athena.

01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:35.360
Bollocks.

01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:27.721
Now what?

01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:31.490
You're asking me?

01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:33.889
This was your idea, kid.

01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:37.161
Yeah.

01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:41.730
You think it will work?

01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:46.241
I guess we have to make it work.

01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:03.603
<i>So, we're making it work.</i>

01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:06.404
<i>First order of business,</i>

01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:08.845
<i>get the door back open.</i>

01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:17.681
<i>Couldn't hurt to get a few
experienced engineers over here.</i>

01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:23.086
<i>Next...</i>

01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:25.801
<i>Put the party back on.</i>

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.606
<i>And print out some new invitations.</i>

01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:35.565
<i>Which brings us to
why we're here today.</i>

01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:39.204
A year ago, it was
all supposed to be over.

01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:40.731
We shouldn't even be here.

01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:42.811
But we are.

01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:47.727
It isn't hard to knock down
a big, evil building

01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:50.485
that's telling everybody
that the world's gonna end.

01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:53.210
What is hard

01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:57.131
is figuring out what to build in its place.

01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:01.801
And if we're gonna do that,
we can't do it alone.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.684
We're gonna need all of you.

01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:10.207
- Frank Walker, may I ask a question?
- Sure.

01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:14.166
The search parameters you've given us,
while mathematically sound,

01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:17.528
are a bit undefined.

01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:20.449
Could you be more specific, please?

01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:22.685
Well, Miss Newton,

01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:26.723
you wanna tell our new recruiters
what they're looking for?

01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:28.211
Dreamers.

01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:32.002
We are looking for dreamers.

01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:35.963
Anyone who will feed the right wolf.

01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:50.401
So, I once told your predecessor

01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:54.886
that she was nothing
but a combination of ones and zeroes.

01:58:58.680 --> 01:58:59.727
I was wrong.

01:59:00.440 --> 01:59:02.044
