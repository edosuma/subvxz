00:17.717 --> 00:19.651
- Ladies and gentleman
it is now time for the

00:19.653 --> 00:22.488
main event of the evening.

00:24.658 --> 00:28.527
Your current, reigning,
defending bfc champion,

00:28.529 --> 00:31.230
Johnny Thompson.

01:18.611 --> 01:20.479
He looks to be in trouble here.

01:29.055 --> 01:31.323
He's down, I can't believe it!

01:31.325 --> 01:34.026
This guys just come on cleaner.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.135
Hey, drop the gun!

02:21.274 --> 02:22.474
- Pick out a gun!

02:22.476 --> 02:23.275
Get down on floor,

02:23.277 --> 02:25.144

02:25.146 --> 02:26.778
Hurry the fuck up!

02:28.481 --> 02:32.251
- Hurry up, hurry up, man
I said hurry the fuck up,

02:32.253 --> 02:33.452

02:33.454 --> 02:34.987
Who the fuck you think
you're looking at?

02:34.989 --> 02:36.788
Keep your hands in the air.

02:36.790 --> 02:39.024
Shut the fuck up, get
to the fucking ground.

02:40.027 --> 02:42.361
- Hurry up!

02:45.966 --> 02:46.966
Come on!

02:49.770 --> 02:51.170
- We ain't got time for that.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.172
Come on!

02:53.173 --> 02:54.706
Get the fuck over there.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.508
Or else I'll blow
your fucking head off.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.476
Move it, move it,

02:57.478 --> 02:59.678
move it, move it, move it!

03:04.784 --> 03:05.751
- Where the fuck,

03:05.753 --> 03:07.186
hurry up, hurry up.

03:10.191 --> 03:11.890
Get down, get down.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.328
Lay it on the ground.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.696
On the fucking,

03:19.032 --> 03:23.335
get your hands spread and
it won't be any trouble.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.138
- 125.

03:26.839 --> 03:28.373
Bank robbery in progress.

03:28.375 --> 03:32.511
Arms out, everyone.

03:32.513 --> 03:33.879
You, how we doing?

03:33.881 --> 03:35.914
We got hurry back, let's go,

04:25.531 --> 04:27.366
- the problem is not your jobs,

04:27.368 --> 04:29.501
it's your credit.

04:29.503 --> 04:33.705
It says here your home
was foreclosed back in,

04:33.707 --> 04:35.507
let me see here, oh,

04:37.410 --> 04:41.880
2009, and on top of that
Emily, it is Emily right?

04:41.882 --> 04:43.682
- Yes, Emily.

04:43.684 --> 04:46.151
- Okay, anyway, Emily,

04:46.153 --> 04:48.787
you recently got back to
the workforce, it says here

04:48.789 --> 04:50.355
that you've been having
trouble making payments

04:50.357 --> 04:52.024
on your student loans.

04:52.026 --> 04:55.560
- The only reason
being I was unemployed.

04:57.263 --> 04:59.131
- Look, I understand.

05:00.733 --> 05:03.368
We know it's not your fault,

05:03.370 --> 05:06.672
but with a credit score of
415, there's just nothing

05:06.674 --> 05:09.308
I can do for you at this time.

05:12.412 --> 05:13.879
Have a nice day.

05:25.591 --> 05:27.926
- Run a CSI in the lab, we
gotta make this priority one,

05:27.928 --> 05:30.095
nobody shoots one of our
cops and gets away with it,

05:30.097 --> 05:31.997
we're gonna find this guy,
we're gonna mess him up,

05:31.999 --> 05:32.999
bad.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.834
- Detective Lee.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.602
How's your wounded officer?

05:37.604 --> 05:38.937
- He's gonna be just find
Miller, now that he knows

05:38.939 --> 05:41.540
the FBI's on the case.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.942
- The last three robberies
they hit the tellers.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.078
This time they hit the
vault, they're getting bolder

05:46.080 --> 05:48.313
and they're breaking
their own rules.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.815
- Who's the dead civilian?

05:49.817 --> 05:52.651
- He was armed, tried to
take on the two bad guys,

05:52.653 --> 05:54.486
bad guy number two got out
the door and engaged our

05:54.488 --> 05:56.355
officer there in
the parking lot.

05:56.357 --> 05:58.924
Wounded the officer
before he got away,

05:58.926 --> 06:00.992
our civilian here is the
reason why dead bad guy

06:00.994 --> 06:02.794
number one is a drt.

06:03.563 --> 06:05.464
- It's a high price.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.265
What do you have on the suspect?

06:07.267 --> 06:08.834
- No ID, nothing on him yet.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.335
But we'll have something soon.

06:10.337 --> 06:12.137
- Get as much as you
can, as soon as you can.

06:12.139 --> 06:15.307
I want criminal background,
work history, affiliations.

06:15.309 --> 06:17.275
The sooner we get a positive
ID the sooner we can catch

06:17.277 --> 06:20.746
his partner before
he pulls another job.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.535
- Johnny?

06:43.537 --> 06:45.237
Johnny Thompson.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.572
- Just back into
town, figured hey,

06:47.574 --> 06:49.608
why not stop by and have a
chat with the old trainer.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.243
- Come in damn it.

06:52.044 --> 06:54.279
It's close to my bedtime.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.986
Want something to drink?

07:00.988 --> 07:03.288
- You got a beer?

07:04.590 --> 07:06.224
- I'm an old, single, black
man and you ask if I have

07:06.226 --> 07:07.226
a beer?

07:14.200 --> 07:15.300
- You still training?

07:15.302 --> 07:16.935
- Until I die.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.371
Mostly boxing though.

07:19.373 --> 07:21.106
- You see my last fight?

07:21.108 --> 07:22.674
- I sure did.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.543
Live in Vegas.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.111
Couldn't miss it.

07:32.385 --> 07:34.686
- Came to ask you a favor.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.423
I need you to train me again.

07:38.425 --> 07:41.560
I've got a fight
coming up, a big one.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.094
The payouts huge.

07:52.238 --> 07:54.706
- What happened
to your trainer in Vegas?

07:54.708 --> 07:56.174
- I dropped him.

07:59.579 --> 08:02.347
- Because of your last fight?

08:02.349 --> 08:04.149
- In part.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.717
- Jesus Johnny.

08:05.719 --> 08:08.520
You have no one to blame
but yourself for that fight,

08:08.522 --> 08:11.656
I mean you moved slow, your
jabs were inconsistent.

08:11.658 --> 08:15.961
And you're looking like
an amateur with that crap.

08:17.663 --> 08:20.532
- Yeah well, that's
why I'm here.

08:23.703 --> 08:27.405
- That picture was
taken right before his death.

08:27.407 --> 08:28.440
- You know,

08:29.909 --> 08:33.544
you're the closest I
had to a real father.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.780
- Your father was a good
man, Johnny, just couldn't

08:36.783 --> 08:38.416
handle temptation.

08:39.452 --> 08:42.587
Bank robbery is a
dangerous business.

08:44.090 --> 08:45.657
- So is fighting.

08:50.229 --> 08:52.731
- Be at the gym first
thing in the morning,

08:52.733 --> 08:54.466
- seven A.M.

08:55.968 --> 08:57.936
- Thanks for the beer.

09:02.408 --> 09:03.408
- Johnny,

09:06.012 --> 09:08.313
don't make me regret this.

09:30.002 --> 09:31.803
- The deal was, you
provide the girls

09:31.805 --> 09:35.340
and receive 40% of
what we bring in.

09:36.776 --> 09:39.210
You're not listening.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.980
That's not what I said.

09:41.982 --> 09:44.215
We've got overhead, and
who do you think checks on

09:44.217 --> 09:48.353
the girls to ensure
they're turning a profit?

09:48.355 --> 09:49.854
You can point your fingers
and someone else takes

09:49.856 --> 09:52.857
the risk, but I'm on the front
line so don't give me that

09:52.859 --> 09:55.727
I'm taking all
the risk bullshit.

09:56.729 --> 09:59.331
I got some other
business to attend to.

09:59.333 --> 10:03.635
Do yourself a favor, be by
the phone when I call back.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.571
Fucking prick.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.575
What the hell happened to you?

10:10.577 --> 10:13.478
You two guys are all
over the fucking news!

10:13.480 --> 10:16.915
- Took too long, Brett
improvised and decided

10:16.917 --> 10:18.850
to hit the vault.

10:18.852 --> 10:21.920
Some cowboy with
a pistol shot him.

10:24.523 --> 10:25.523
- Nice.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.893
Looks like you got
the whole take.

10:28.895 --> 10:31.129
I know it all went
to shit today,

10:31.131 --> 10:34.599
but maybe we should hit
the vaults every time.

10:34.601 --> 10:36.167
- Maybe.

10:36.169 --> 10:39.871
But it's gonna take more
than two guys to pull it off.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.474
- How many guys do you
think we need to do the job?

10:42.476 --> 10:44.476
- At least three.

10:44.478 --> 10:48.513
Two on the inside, one on
the outside as the driver,

10:48.515 --> 10:50.382
four would be better.

10:55.621 --> 10:57.355
- I got somebody
from the inside,

10:57.357 --> 10:58.823
Johnny Thompson.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.426
- Johnny Thompson's back?

11:01.428 --> 11:06.097
- He's back from Vegas,
he's training here again.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.032
- I'll be damned.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.800
- Think he'd be interested?

11:08.802 --> 11:12.337
- Its in his blood,
but I don't know.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.873
- He'd make a great
partner, you know?

11:14.875 --> 11:19.077
He's smart, he's tough,
he's got no fear.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.912
- Alright I'll reach out to
Johnny but that's still only

11:20.914 --> 11:23.114
two, we need a wheel man.

11:24.116 --> 11:25.383
- How about that young kid?

11:25.385 --> 11:28.186
He's done some jobs
for us in the past,

11:28.188 --> 11:31.690
you know the one who works with
his father at the body shop.

11:31.692 --> 11:35.960
- Ah, Brendan, yeah that
kid's got some skills,

11:35.962 --> 11:38.263
he's an adrenaline junkie.

11:39.331 --> 11:42.634
Hell he's so crazy,
he just might do it.

11:42.636 --> 11:44.669
- Alright that's three.

11:44.671 --> 11:47.806
Let's keep it at
that for right now.

11:49.408 --> 11:53.745
- So let's say, we hit the
vaults, increase our take,

11:53.747 --> 11:56.881
we can't clean that kind
of volume from the salon.

11:56.883 --> 12:00.952
We're talking maybe three,
four times our current take,

12:00.954 --> 12:03.822
now Eric, he's done
okay laundering the cash

12:03.824 --> 12:08.126
but, I don't think he can
handle this kind of volume.

12:10.763 --> 12:13.064
- Alright, continue to
funnel the money from

12:13.066 --> 12:17.268
the girls on the street
through the mail slot.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.404
We use the bank money to
get into the real estate

12:19.406 --> 12:23.241
business, we hit the
banks, you falsify the loan

12:23.243 --> 12:26.311
applications for the
properties we buy,

12:26.313 --> 12:30.014
we launder the money
through the mortgages.

12:31.851 --> 12:32.984
- I like it.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.592
- He can't do that!

12:40.594 --> 12:43.728
Come on, come on,
Johnny turn it up.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.296
- Keep the pressure on him.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.298
Good.

12:50.402 --> 12:53.171
There you go, good take down.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.405
Hey, get in on that.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.315
What are you smiling for?

13:04.317 --> 13:07.552
The guys only been
training for two weeks.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.321
Your jabs are weak and
your footwork is sloppy.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.190
Go hit the heavy bag.

13:33.746 --> 13:36.414
- My father heard you
were back in town.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.949
Told him I had to see it
with my own eyes before

13:37.951 --> 13:39.250
I believed it.

13:40.719 --> 13:45.223
- Whatever you're offering,
I'm not interested.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.759
- Just came by to say hi,
thought maybe we could

13:47.761 --> 13:49.794
catch up, have a drink.

13:52.865 --> 13:55.300
- I'm straightened out, Jason.

13:55.302 --> 13:59.737
The upcoming fight and my
kid, all I care about now.

13:59.739 --> 14:02.941
- I saw your fight in Vegas,
man you took a beating

14:02.943 --> 14:03.975
didn't you?

14:05.110 --> 14:06.711
- What do you want, Jason?

14:06.713 --> 14:09.047
What are you doing here?

14:09.049 --> 14:12.250
- My father and I have
a job offer for you.

14:12.252 --> 14:15.587
If you change your mind
and you're interested,

14:15.589 --> 14:18.389
time and a place is on the card.

14:22.027 --> 14:25.496
Not gonna forget what you
did on the inside Johnny.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.866
You need anything, call me.

14:38.477 --> 14:42.380
- So, who are we going
out with tonight?

14:42.382 --> 14:45.316
- Just Eric and my father.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.185
- You think Eric is
ever going to get a girl

14:47.187 --> 14:49.320
and settle down?

14:49.322 --> 14:52.690
- I hope not, he's
my last ray of hope.

14:58.163 --> 14:59.964
You ready to go?

14:59.966 --> 15:02.967
- I'm ready to go
have a good time.

15:17.316 --> 15:20.151
- Baby you like this
song, don't you?

15:20.153 --> 15:21.719
- You know I do.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.288
What do you think?

15:23.290 --> 15:25.523
- I think you need to go
out there and get warmed up,

15:25.525 --> 15:27.892
I'm gonna talk business
for a few minutes.

15:27.894 --> 15:30.795
I'll come give
you what you want.

15:31.897 --> 15:34.365
- Like you know what I want?

15:40.572 --> 15:43.107
- I think you pissed her off.

15:43.876 --> 15:46.377
- She'll get over it.

15:46.379 --> 15:50.915
- Business is great, we're
gonna increase our cash flow.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.116
- Really?

15:52.118 --> 15:53.518
- Thin you can handle
the extra volume?

15:53.520 --> 15:56.087
- I don't know, maybe.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.789
What'd you have in mind?

15:57.791 --> 16:00.558
- Real estate, we'll
buy property, flip it,

16:00.560 --> 16:02.360
take our profits.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.762
We won't hold onto any
inventory, we won't keep

16:04.764 --> 16:05.764
any property.

16:07.399 --> 16:09.167
- What kind of real estate
are you talking about?

16:09.169 --> 16:11.135
- Anything that
will turn a profit.

16:11.137 --> 16:15.206
Commercial, residential,
vacation, doesn't matter.

16:15.208 --> 16:18.910
As long as it'll close
quickly, it's marketable.

16:18.912 --> 16:22.447
- Closing takes 30 to 60
days, what with appraisals,

16:22.449 --> 16:24.415
background checks, et cetera.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.883
- Eric,

16:25.885 --> 16:27.919
we've worked long enough
together for me to know

16:27.921 --> 16:31.622
that you enjoy the
good life, right?

16:31.624 --> 16:32.857
- Yeah.

16:32.859 --> 16:35.760
- So tell me Eric,
how much is enough?

16:36.895 --> 16:39.263
- I can never have enough.

16:39.265 --> 16:44.168
- Help us with this and it's
an extra 100 grand a month.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.870
- Keep talking.

16:45.872 --> 16:47.739
- Jason's a licensed
real estate agent.

16:47.741 --> 16:51.442
He'll do the paperwork,
you close the deal.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.245
Can you handle it?

16:57.317 --> 17:00.818
Consider that your
first month's advance.

17:02.254 --> 17:04.655
- Oh yeah, I can handle it.

17:06.592 --> 17:09.827
- Alright, a toast gentlemen.

17:15.934 --> 17:18.502
- Well, I gotta take a break.

17:24.643 --> 17:26.444
- We're selling him.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.081
- Alright bye.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.455
- You guys done?

17:37.457 --> 17:38.656
- Just about.

17:39.825 --> 17:43.561
Have a little bit more
business to discuss.

17:45.230 --> 17:46.764
You still pissed?

17:52.571 --> 17:54.272
- You have no idea.

18:06.218 --> 18:07.251
- Be right up.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.619
- Okay.

18:16.795 --> 18:19.030
- I don't know about
you but the heat

18:19.032 --> 18:21.365
and the alcohol make
me sweat like a pig.

18:21.367 --> 18:24.168
- Yeah, I have the same problem.

18:48.560 --> 18:49.894
- Hey Caleb.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.096
How you doing buddy?

18:52.098 --> 18:54.932
- Fine, do you wanna see my mom?

18:54.934 --> 18:57.235
- No, I'm here to see you.

18:58.270 --> 18:59.804
Do you know who I am?

18:59.806 --> 19:00.806
- No.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.744
- I'm your father, Caleb.

19:06.746 --> 19:10.281
I've been gone for a
bit, but now I'm back.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.350
I'm here to see you.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.986
- My mom said my dad was dead.

19:18.624 --> 19:19.624
- Dead?

19:20.826 --> 19:25.696
- She said he died of
cancer when I was only two.

19:25.698 --> 19:26.964
- Well,

19:26.966 --> 19:30.768
- Caleb what the hell's
the door doing open?

19:32.738 --> 19:34.739
Who the hell is this?

19:34.741 --> 19:37.708
- I'm Caleb's
father, who are you?

19:40.847 --> 19:45.349
- J, there's some over here
claiming to be your ex.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.918
Where'd you say you were from?

19:46.920 --> 19:47.952
- I didn't.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.993
- Johnny fucking Thompson.

19:57.162 --> 19:58.529
I'll be damned.

19:59.798 --> 20:03.801
You know, never thought
you'd walk again after that

20:03.803 --> 20:05.303
last fight.

20:05.305 --> 20:09.073
- Oh shit, dude that was
you, man you got the fuck

20:09.075 --> 20:10.541
beat out of you.

20:11.610 --> 20:13.511
- Why don't you go
back inside the house.

20:13.513 --> 20:16.514
I need to speak with
Jennifer in private.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.382
- What in the hell
are you doing here?

20:18.384 --> 20:20.051
- I came to see my boy.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.586
- Mom, I thought you
said my dad was...

20:21.588 --> 20:22.954
- Caleb, go inside.

20:22.956 --> 20:25.256
- But...
- I said go inside!

20:26.792 --> 20:29.760
- I have a right to
see him Jennifer.

20:29.762 --> 20:30.762
- No.

20:31.730 --> 20:32.997
No you don't.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.198
You know what?

20:34.200 --> 20:36.801
You lost that right
a long time ago.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.103
How long has it been since
you've seen your son?

20:39.105 --> 20:40.404
Huh?

20:40.406 --> 20:42.340
Huh, maybe, I don't know
six or seven years, huh?

20:42.342 --> 20:44.976
Mr. big shot fighter
too good for his own

20:44.978 --> 20:47.511
flesh and blood and his wife!

20:50.315 --> 20:52.550
What about child support, huh?

20:52.552 --> 20:53.517
Forget about that too?

20:53.519 --> 20:55.319
How fucking convenient.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.925
- Listen, I'm sorry
about all that.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.060
I was in a different
place that I am now,

21:03.062 --> 21:05.363
I wanna make it up to him.

21:07.966 --> 21:09.200
- No, Johnny.

21:10.736 --> 21:12.803
It's too late for that.

21:14.072 --> 21:17.475
- Yeah, I think it's time
you fucking left now.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.176
- And I think it's about time
you shut your fucking mouth

21:19.178 --> 21:20.578
and get back inside the house!
- Hey!

21:20.580 --> 21:22.446
- This doesn't concern you.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.448
- Go.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.886
Fuck, you know what?

21:28.888 --> 21:33.190
I have a court order that
says that Caleb is mine!

21:33.992 --> 21:36.560
And if I see you
here ever again,

21:36.562 --> 21:40.898
I will call the fucking
cops, do you hear me?

21:40.900 --> 21:41.900
Now leave.

21:42.901 --> 21:45.503
I said get the fuck outta here.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.772
Fucking piece of shit.

22:02.788 --> 22:05.089
- What's the asking price?

22:06.491 --> 22:07.792
- 2.5 million.

22:08.794 --> 22:10.795
- Let's see if anybody's home.

22:23.575 --> 22:25.176
- Hi, are you here
to see that house?

22:25.178 --> 22:26.243
- Yes we are.

22:26.245 --> 22:27.311
- Thanks, come on in.

22:27.313 --> 22:29.013
- How you doing?

22:29.015 --> 22:29.847
- Jason.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.549
- Nice to meet you.

22:31.551 --> 22:34.785
- It's a beautiful place.

23:05.384 --> 23:09.320
- Hope you guys haven't
been waiting long.

23:09.322 --> 23:11.956
- You cost us a lot
of money, Johnny.

23:11.958 --> 23:15.025
The next time you borrow
money to bet on yourself,

23:15.027 --> 23:18.162
make sure you can win the fight.

23:18.164 --> 23:20.664
- Yeah well, about that.

23:20.666 --> 23:22.233
I'm not really
sure what happened.

23:22.235 --> 23:25.136
- I'll tell you what
happened, motherfucker.

23:25.138 --> 23:28.038
You let your ass get
kicked by some 22 year old

23:28.040 --> 23:31.308
no-name, underdog
bitch from the streets.

23:38.350 --> 23:42.620
And what's strange to me
is how fast you went down,

23:42.622 --> 23:45.790
I watched you previous
fights, that's why I agreed

23:45.792 --> 23:49.927
to this bet, so I must
say I'm very disappointed

23:51.029 --> 23:52.830
in your performance.

23:56.134 --> 23:58.602
Did you know I used
to be a boxer, Johnny?

23:58.604 --> 24:02.006
That's why I'm doing
what I do today.

24:02.008 --> 24:04.008
I'm still pretty
good with my hands,

24:04.010 --> 24:07.578
so I figure why not
make money with them.

24:09.548 --> 24:13.284
The deal was simple,
we loan you the money,

24:13.286 --> 24:16.687
we set the odds, and
you win the fight.

24:18.023 --> 24:21.425
Now with your record that
should've been a cakewalk.

24:21.427 --> 24:23.527
But I'm beginning to think
that maybe you were double

24:23.529 --> 24:27.832
dipping, maybe you had a bet
on the side for more money

24:28.934 --> 24:32.169
and that's why
your ass went down.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.971
So, you leave Vegas.

24:36.374 --> 24:39.743
And you come and you're
living here in this shit hole

24:39.745 --> 24:44.548
apartment in this shit
hole town and obviously you

24:44.550 --> 24:47.918
don't have any cash
stashed around here,

24:47.920 --> 24:50.988
so I guess what
really happened is,

24:52.791 --> 24:53.858
how can I say it?

24:53.860 --> 24:55.326
You bitched out.

24:57.963 --> 25:02.199
Problem is, Johnny, I
loaned you 150 plus the vig.

25:05.770 --> 25:08.906
Which was pretty
steep in your case.

25:09.941 --> 25:13.010
But now I'd say you
owe me a million.

25:15.881 --> 25:17.882
- I've got another
fight coming up.

25:17.884 --> 25:22.186
And with the earnings, I
can pay you what I owe you.

25:22.188 --> 25:25.356
You get the money that
you lent me plus the vig,

25:25.358 --> 25:27.491
and we call it even.

25:27.493 --> 25:30.261
- That's not how
it works, Johnny.

25:30.263 --> 25:32.763
You see some of the
money you lost belongs

25:32.765 --> 25:36.567
to people that I don't
even wanna fuck with.

25:37.602 --> 25:40.638
So the problem is I
owe money as well.

25:58.089 --> 26:01.258
Now you might be thinking,
what does being good

26:01.260 --> 26:05.262
with your hands have to
do with being a bookie?

26:09.968 --> 26:12.336
- Cut the bullshit, Joe.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.305
Just get it over with.

26:23.048 --> 26:26.317
- Pain doesn't scare
you, does it Johnny?

26:26.319 --> 26:28.986
Well I got something that will.

26:28.988 --> 26:32.356
You've got til the end of the
fight to bring me a million

26:32.358 --> 26:36.327
dollars or we're gonna
take your son and I'm gonna

26:36.329 --> 26:38.562
practice my trade on him.

26:39.931 --> 26:43.167
Let me tell you something,
Johnny, I'm not very good

26:43.169 --> 26:47.204
with kids so imagine
I'll really fuck this up.

26:53.045 --> 26:54.345
That's enough.

26:55.347 --> 26:57.381
He's gotta win his
next fight doesn't he?

26:57.383 --> 26:58.383
- Yeah.

27:06.524 --> 27:07.725
- Oh yeah.

27:07.727 --> 27:10.194
While I'm thinking about it.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.430
Put that in your wallet.

27:14.733 --> 27:18.135
You remember how you felt
when you lost your dad?

27:18.137 --> 27:20.771
That's nothing compared
to the pain you'll feel

27:20.773 --> 27:22.840
when you lose your son.

27:48.066 --> 27:49.600
- Rachel?

27:49.602 --> 27:50.602
- Johnny.

27:52.170 --> 27:53.971
What are you doing here?

27:53.973 --> 27:55.806
- I was just here to
meet some old friends.

27:55.808 --> 27:58.709
- No, I mean home, what
are you doing at home?

27:58.711 --> 28:00.744
Are you just visiting?

28:00.746 --> 28:02.212
- No.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.682
- There's our boy now,
chatting up the waitress.

28:04.684 --> 28:05.582
- Training?

28:05.584 --> 28:06.550
- Yeah.

28:06.552 --> 28:07.918
- For how long?

28:08.787 --> 28:11.588
- Be honest, I'm not quite sure.

28:12.424 --> 28:13.691
It's been awhile.

28:13.693 --> 28:17.194
- Yeah, it was nice
running into you.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.662
- Yeah, you too.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.533
- Come see me before you leave.

28:22.535 --> 28:24.001
- Okay.

28:26.504 --> 28:28.138
- Johnny Thompson.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.641
In town less than a
minute already hitting up

28:30.643 --> 28:32.076
on the redhead.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.911
- Been a long time,
Johnny, good to see you.

28:33.913 --> 28:34.745
- You too.

28:34.747 --> 28:36.714
- Have a seat.

28:38.950 --> 28:41.518
- Well let's get right to it.

28:41.520 --> 28:45.122
We got a lot of jobs
lined up and we need a man

28:45.124 --> 28:48.158
with your skills
to make it happen.

28:51.529 --> 28:54.631
- What kind of skill set
are we talking about?

28:54.633 --> 28:57.668
- What kind of skills
are we talking about?

28:57.670 --> 28:59.636
We're talking about
armed robbery.

28:59.638 --> 29:00.604
Banks.

29:00.606 --> 29:04.274
I need a partner, if you
come in with us you get

29:04.276 --> 29:06.477
15% of the net take.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.451
- When do we start?

29:16.688 --> 29:18.355
- Tomorrow.

29:18.357 --> 29:21.225
Meet the driver
at this location.

29:28.466 --> 29:29.466
- Hey, hey!

29:31.336 --> 29:34.705
You didn't come see
me before you left.

29:35.740 --> 29:37.574
- Sorry, my mind's just
a bit out of the place

29:37.576 --> 29:38.576
right now.

29:39.677 --> 29:41.678
- Well, my shift is
over, you wanna go grab

29:41.680 --> 29:44.448
some coffee or something?

29:44.450 --> 29:45.916
- Sure, why not.

29:46.751 --> 29:47.951
- I'll drive.

29:52.390 --> 29:55.526
So, what made you
finally come back?

29:57.028 --> 29:59.530
- Mostly to get my son,
I need to get him away

29:59.532 --> 30:00.597
from my ex.

30:02.367 --> 30:05.035
- And how exactly do
you plan on doing that?

30:05.037 --> 30:06.103
- Money.

30:06.105 --> 30:08.505
Buys everything doesn't it?

30:12.343 --> 30:14.812
- You know, I've missed you.

30:17.248 --> 30:19.116
I know we were having some
problems and everything

30:19.118 --> 30:21.084
but you just took off.

30:23.454 --> 30:25.255
Didn't even warn me.

30:26.958 --> 30:29.092
- You see my last fight?

30:30.261 --> 30:32.062
- Yeah I watched it.

30:35.900 --> 30:39.036
- You know what
the funny thing is?

30:39.038 --> 30:41.271
It took a five year stint
behind bars to finally

30:41.273 --> 30:45.375
gain the skills necessary
to fight professionally.

30:45.377 --> 30:49.346
I mean, I grew up around
it, but I never really cared

30:49.348 --> 30:52.149
for it until I got away from it.

30:53.785 --> 30:56.053
- Come on, let's go
back to my place,

30:56.055 --> 30:57.387
I've got something to show you.

30:57.389 --> 30:58.488
- What?

30:58.490 --> 31:00.457
- Come on, you'll see.

31:14.138 --> 31:17.341
Here, why don't you
pour us some wine

31:19.444 --> 31:21.645
and I will be right back.

31:52.410 --> 31:54.544
- What are you looking at?

31:54.546 --> 31:55.712
- Nothing.

31:55.714 --> 31:57.014
- Have a seat.

32:00.184 --> 32:01.852
I made this for you, but you
left before I had a chance

32:01.854 --> 32:03.453
to give it to you.

32:12.797 --> 32:14.798
- How did you do this?

32:14.800 --> 32:18.101
- I'm a photographer,
it was easy.

32:18.103 --> 32:21.171
- Yeah but, all the
pictures of my father,

32:21.173 --> 32:22.739
I mean how'd you get 'em?

32:22.741 --> 32:26.576
- Connections, I
know people, Johnny.

32:26.578 --> 32:27.945
Do you like it?

32:28.980 --> 32:30.213
- It's great.

32:32.517 --> 32:34.751
Thank you for doing this.

33:54.832 --> 33:56.700
So how do you know this kid?

33:56.702 --> 33:58.402
- Him and his father
run a body shop,

33:58.404 --> 34:01.138
he's pulled a couple of
jobs for us in the past.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.306
He's a hell of a driver.

34:03.308 --> 34:04.441
- Trust him?

34:05.176 --> 34:06.543
- With my life.

34:08.746 --> 34:09.746
Brendan.

34:10.982 --> 34:13.583
I'd like you to meet your
new teammate, Johnny.

34:13.585 --> 34:16.920
- My pleasure, I've
seen you on TV.

34:16.922 --> 34:18.822
You got some stones, man.

34:18.824 --> 34:20.924
Getting on the mat with
some of those animals.

34:20.926 --> 34:22.426
- I like the rush.

34:22.428 --> 34:26.228
- Ah, you like the
combat, I like the chase.

34:27.931 --> 34:31.068
I think that's why
this is gonna work out.

34:31.070 --> 34:33.370
- Well? You ready?

34:33.371 --> 34:35.038
- Let's do it.

34:35.040 --> 34:39.176
You guys go on the side,
have yourselves a look.

34:55.092 --> 34:56.092
- Not bad.

34:57.895 --> 35:00.363
- That's our wheel man.

35:00.365 --> 35:01.365
Let's go.

35:07.071 --> 35:09.106
That's the bank.

35:09.108 --> 35:13.643
They open at nine o'clock,
we go in at nine thirty.

35:13.645 --> 35:17.380
Brendan's gonna Jack the car
and we're gonna pull up front,

35:17.382 --> 35:21.251
I go in, exactly thirty
seconds later you go in.

35:21.253 --> 35:24.454
I'll be crowd control,
you take out the guard

35:24.456 --> 35:26.223
and head for the vault.

35:26.225 --> 35:28.458
That's why we have to do
this in three minutes,

35:28.460 --> 35:30.694
we want that vault money.

35:31.429 --> 35:33.597
If anybody becomes a problem,

35:33.599 --> 35:34.831
take 'em out.

35:35.900 --> 35:38.168
I don't got any
problem with that.

35:38.170 --> 35:39.170
- Good.

35:44.342 --> 35:45.208
More wine?

35:45.210 --> 35:46.210
- Mhm.

35:51.082 --> 35:51.915
- To us.

35:51.917 --> 35:55.051
- To us.

36:04.162 --> 36:07.197
- You know I was thinking,
maybe after work dies

36:07.199 --> 36:11.468
down we should go out of
town, get out of the country.

36:11.470 --> 36:14.738
- Well, where'd
you have in mind?

36:14.740 --> 36:17.207
- Someplace hot, and exotic.

36:26.117 --> 36:27.117
Eric.

36:28.986 --> 36:29.986
- Jason.

36:32.423 --> 36:33.590
- How you doing man?

36:33.592 --> 36:35.959
- Good, just checking
out the scenery.

36:35.961 --> 36:37.194
- You here alone?

36:37.196 --> 36:39.696
- No, no I'm here with
a friend from Vegas.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.332
- Why don't you guys
come over and join us?

36:42.334 --> 36:45.235
- Good idea, Joe,
come over here.

36:47.672 --> 36:48.838
This is my friend Jason,

36:48.840 --> 36:51.575
- Jason, Joe.
- His wife Kristen.

36:53.444 --> 36:55.845
- Pleasure meeting both of you.

37:04.088 --> 37:06.523
- So Eric says you're
in town from Vegas,

37:06.525 --> 37:08.525
what'd you do?

37:08.527 --> 37:12.462
- I'm an investor,
how about yourself?

37:12.464 --> 37:15.599
- I run a nail salon
with my father.

37:16.901 --> 37:20.971
I also dabble a little
bit in real estate.

37:20.973 --> 37:23.807
- I think you're the first
white guy I've ever heard

37:23.809 --> 37:26.376
that owns a nail salon.

37:26.378 --> 37:27.911
Very interesting.

37:29.113 --> 37:31.848
You dabble in real
estate, buying or selling?

37:31.850 --> 37:32.816
- Both.

37:32.818 --> 37:38.255
- Well, I have some property
in Vegas you may be interested,

37:39.290 --> 37:41.691
if you are, give me a call.

37:43.394 --> 37:45.695
- So how long are
you in town, Joe?

37:45.697 --> 37:47.831
- Two weeks, maybe less.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.301
- I like your suit.

37:53.471 --> 37:55.639
Looks nice on you.

37:55.641 --> 37:56.641
- Thanks.

38:00.978 --> 38:03.713
- I have to use the ladies room.

38:04.782 --> 38:07.851
I shall return, so
don't go anywhere.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.992
- You have a very
beautiful wife.

38:17.595 --> 38:19.896
- She keeps me on my toes.

38:22.033 --> 38:24.334
- Oh, excuse me gentlemen.

38:25.803 --> 38:28.271
I need to make a phone call.

38:42.520 --> 38:43.887
- What are you lookin' at?

38:43.889 --> 38:45.855
- Oh I think you know.

38:53.564 --> 38:54.998
Call me.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.468
When you're ready to
get together again.

39:00.738 --> 39:02.305
You know last time I
thought it just might have

39:02.307 --> 39:03.840
been the alcohol.

39:07.611 --> 39:09.346
- It was.

41:28.853 --> 41:30.086
- Hold on a second.
- Sure.

41:30.088 --> 41:32.088
- Hey, hey, hey you, sir,

41:32.090 --> 41:34.224
you need to remove your hat.

41:34.226 --> 41:36.159

41:36.161 --> 41:37.861
You, screw it, move.

41:37.863 --> 41:39.195

41:55.547 --> 41:57.080

41:57.082 --> 41:59.582
Move it, everybody get down!

42:03.321 --> 42:05.488

42:05.490 --> 42:07.023

42:07.025 --> 42:08.791

- Move towards me,

42:59.778 --> 43:00.610
- Shut up!

43:00.612 --> 43:01.444

43:05.950 --> 43:07.617
Mom!

43:07.619 --> 43:10.053
- Mom!
- You want your mommy?

43:10.055 --> 43:11.888
I'll get her, get
out of the car!

43:11.890 --> 43:13.089
- Mom!

43:13.091 --> 43:13.756
- Get the hell out of the car!

43:13.758 --> 43:14.758
- Mom!

43:15.459 --> 43:16.392
- Yeah?

43:16.394 --> 43:17.627
That hurt, you want some more?

43:17.629 --> 43:21.531
You want me to tie you
up, you little shit?

43:21.533 --> 43:22.899
Stop, sit down.

43:26.838 --> 43:28.705
- Piece of shit.

43:28.707 --> 43:30.239
Why don't you try hitting
somebody who hits back,

43:30.241 --> 43:31.574
motherfucker?
- Fuck you.

43:33.678 --> 43:35.244
- Mom, mom, mom!

43:35.246 --> 43:36.679
- I will fucking kill you!

43:36.681 --> 43:37.747
- Mom! Mom!

43:38.849 --> 43:39.849

43:42.654 --> 43:45.455
- J stop it you're killing him!

43:45.457 --> 43:47.724
Hey, I'm gonna kill you!

43:50.495 --> 43:52.595
Now stay the fuck down.

43:52.597 --> 43:54.230
- The cops are coming, Johnny.
- I'm gonna get you out

43:54.232 --> 43:57.967
of here Caleb.
- You're going back to prison!

43:57.969 --> 43:58.969
No! No!

43:59.703 --> 44:00.937
- Get the fuck off me.

44:00.939 --> 44:02.872
- No! Caleb
please let him go!

44:02.874 --> 44:03.874
My son!

44:14.818 --> 44:16.319
- Put the kid down!

44:16.321 --> 44:20.657
Put the kid down, hands
on your head, turn around.

44:20.659 --> 44:22.392
Hands on your head,
now turn around.

44:22.394 --> 44:23.826
- Turn around,
get the kid away from him.

44:23.828 --> 44:25.695
- Get on your knees!

44:25.697 --> 44:26.896
- I hate you!

44:31.669 --> 44:32.735
I hate you!

44:34.171 --> 44:35.538
I hate you!

44:35.540 --> 44:36.606
- Let's go.

44:40.778 --> 44:42.912
- I hate you!

44:44.148 --> 44:46.983
You're going to hell, Johnny.

44:46.985 --> 44:48.051
I hate you!

44:59.898 --> 45:01.297
- Johnny Thompson?

45:01.299 --> 45:02.932
Aright 10-4.

45:02.934 --> 45:04.734
Thompson is b and b.

45:12.176 --> 45:14.177
- Hey, it's your lucky
day, you made bail,

45:14.179 --> 45:15.179
come on.

45:27.825 --> 45:30.126
- Wish I could say I was
surprised to see you.

45:30.128 --> 45:31.694
- Your debts just went
up from one million

45:31.696 --> 45:33.096
to two million.

45:35.165 --> 45:37.734
- What's so funny, Johnny?

45:37.736 --> 45:40.236
I want in on the heists.

45:40.238 --> 45:43.439
- We have taken in anywhere
near that kind of money,

45:43.441 --> 45:45.908
and the cuts already
split four ways.

45:45.910 --> 45:50.113
- Well that's no problem,
you just renegotiate the cuts

45:50.115 --> 45:52.181
or start hitting more banks.

45:55.819 --> 45:59.856
Now, you go tell your friends,
you have a new partner.

45:59.858 --> 46:04.026
And that I'll be stopping
in to pay them a visit.

46:10.367 --> 46:11.567
- Here we go.

46:13.937 --> 46:16.305
The santache brothers, huh?

46:18.075 --> 46:19.575
I see the resemblance.

46:19.577 --> 46:20.610
- I'm adopted.

46:33.423 --> 46:37.293
- That's for not telling
me about the heists.

46:55.947 --> 46:57.180
- Yes?

46:57.182 --> 46:59.248
- Agent pate, I want
you to make a list

46:59.250 --> 47:01.684
of every boxer, every mma
fighter in the Kansas City

47:01.686 --> 47:04.620
metropolitan area,
professional and amateur

47:04.622 --> 47:07.590
with a criminal record, asap.

47:07.592 --> 47:09.292
- I'll get to it
as soon as I can.

47:09.294 --> 47:10.426
- Thank you.

47:23.675 --> 47:24.675
- My god.

47:27.110 --> 47:29.345
You look like shit.

47:29.347 --> 47:31.681
What the hell happened to you?

47:31.683 --> 47:33.049
- You want the long version?

47:33.051 --> 47:34.750
Or the short?

47:34.752 --> 47:38.654
- This time of night I only
have Patience for the short.

47:38.656 --> 47:41.624
- Broke a guys
nose, went to jail,

47:43.026 --> 47:46.095
got bailed out, and then I
had the pleasure of getting

47:46.097 --> 47:48.664
my ass kicked by
a very large man.

47:48.666 --> 47:50.266
- And I thought my
customers were bad,

47:50.268 --> 47:51.934
what are you doing here?

47:51.936 --> 47:54.270
- I figure, hey, since
my car's impounded,

47:54.272 --> 47:56.706
why not stop by and
see if you want to grab

47:56.708 --> 47:58.107
a bite to eat.

47:58.109 --> 47:59.675
- Course you did.

48:08.352 --> 48:09.352
Get in.

48:20.964 --> 48:22.798
- Step into it.

48:22.800 --> 48:25.001
Good, keep your right up.

48:28.171 --> 48:30.339
Throw your hook,
throw your hooks,

48:30.341 --> 48:31.641
work you body.

48:36.313 --> 48:38.147
There you go, stay more in
jail, more in jail Johnny,

48:38.149 --> 48:39.949
step into your jail.

48:43.921 --> 48:46.722
Hooks, hooks, hooks to the body.

48:47.758 --> 48:50.893
Good, getting close,
go to the body.

48:54.164 --> 48:56.032
Okay, use your hooks.

48:58.435 --> 49:00.336
- Which one's Johnny?

49:01.605 --> 49:04.140
- Well you don't like someone
who follows the sport.

49:04.142 --> 49:05.641
Why do you wanna know?

49:05.643 --> 49:08.377
- Well, I don't follow the
sport, I'm an attorney,

49:08.379 --> 49:10.813
and I have a client that
follows mma and he wants

49:10.815 --> 49:14.583
me to set up a fight
with Johnny, so again,

49:14.585 --> 49:16.218
which ones Johnny?

49:17.354 --> 49:20.990
- He's in the black
shorts, grey tank top.

49:20.992 --> 49:22.458
- Thank you sir.

49:24.127 --> 49:26.662
- Those are looking too weak.

49:31.301 --> 49:33.669
Spit in the fucking bucket.

49:43.847 --> 49:46.048
- Thank you sir.

49:57.894 --> 49:59.862
- See the guy leaving?

50:01.698 --> 50:06.502
Says he's an attorney, has an
interest in you for a fight.

50:06.504 --> 50:08.170
You ever seen him before?

50:08.172 --> 50:09.172
- No.

50:25.222 --> 50:26.856
- I'm gonna go meet
some girlfriends,

50:26.858 --> 50:28.657
what are your plans?

50:29.926 --> 50:33.229
- Stay out as long as you
like, got a business meeting,

50:33.231 --> 50:35.631
it's gonna take a
little bit of time.

50:35.633 --> 50:39.935
- Okay, if you change your
mind be sure and call me.

50:42.272 --> 50:43.272
Stop.

50:44.875 --> 50:48.310
I'm already clean I don't
wanna clean up again,

50:48.312 --> 50:50.780
I'll take care of you later.

50:58.321 --> 51:00.589
- I wanna hit bigger banks.

51:00.591 --> 51:03.692
15% of the cuts not enough.

51:03.694 --> 51:06.395
Either we renegotiate
the terms, or we start

51:06.397 --> 51:09.031
hitting bigger scores.

51:09.033 --> 51:11.934
- You just get back in
the game, you hit one bank

51:11.936 --> 51:13.269
and you think you're
in a position to start

51:13.271 --> 51:14.637
negotiating terms?

51:14.639 --> 51:17.173
- This last job was a breeze.

51:18.241 --> 51:20.209
So why don't we go
after bigger fish

51:20.211 --> 51:21.977
and make it worth the risk.

51:21.979 --> 51:23.746
- What are you thinking?

51:23.748 --> 51:26.382
- Bigger banks, bigger vaults,

51:27.217 --> 51:28.851
or two in one day.

51:30.353 --> 51:33.989
- We do that, we're definitely
gonna need another guy.

51:33.991 --> 51:35.925
What do you say, wheel man?

51:35.927 --> 51:37.526
You up for the action?

51:37.528 --> 51:40.262
- I've got no problem with that.

51:40.264 --> 51:43.933
But we're taking on more
risk, I'll need to exit

51:43.935 --> 51:47.169
before you and Johnny
to get the car running

51:47.171 --> 51:49.839
or we'll need another guy.

51:49.841 --> 51:51.340
- No, no, no.

51:51.342 --> 51:55.377
We keep the crew as it
is, we just work faster.

51:56.446 --> 51:58.414
But can you handle it?

52:00.117 --> 52:04.487
- Look man, I love the
chase, and the high just

52:04.489 --> 52:07.656
got that much better,
so like I said,

52:07.658 --> 52:08.691
no problem.

52:10.660 --> 52:14.797
- Alright, case out some
banks, then we'll talk.

52:58.742 --> 53:01.977
- Come on, what's
taking you so long?

53:19.597 --> 53:21.830
- Oh you gotta be kidding me.

53:21.832 --> 53:25.634
- Just wait a second,
maybe they'll go away.

53:30.074 --> 53:31.874
- Son of a bitch.

53:31.876 --> 53:35.344
- Maybe we should
ignore it, it's late,

53:35.346 --> 53:38.280
could be like a
weirdo or something.

53:38.282 --> 53:40.082
- Afraid it's Jason?

53:48.325 --> 53:52.127
- Sir, you left your
card at the front desk.

53:54.998 --> 53:56.498
- This is it.

53:56.500 --> 53:58.500
We have to be quick.

53:58.502 --> 54:01.203
We all go inside and
we're methodical,

54:01.205 --> 54:04.340
Brendan you hit the registers,
as soon as the last bag

54:04.342 --> 54:08.077
is close to full, you grab
it and you get the car.

54:08.079 --> 54:11.714
Johnny, you grab the bank
manager and get the vault.

54:11.716 --> 54:15.117
We have two minutes
to fill four bags.

54:15.119 --> 54:16.418
Any questions?

54:17.621 --> 54:18.887
- I think we got it.

54:18.889 --> 54:20.256
- Got it.

54:20.258 --> 54:21.824
- Alright.

54:21.826 --> 54:24.126
I'll tell my dad we're on.

54:37.274 --> 54:38.207
- Good morning.

54:38.209 --> 54:39.209
- Morning.

54:51.388 --> 54:53.689
- Are you in love with me?

54:56.826 --> 54:58.994
I think you are.

54:58.996 --> 55:01.096
- What makes you so sure?

55:01.098 --> 55:02.965
- Well, last night...

55:06.736 --> 55:09.171
You did that thing I like.

55:09.173 --> 55:11.874
- So pleasure equals love.

55:11.876 --> 55:15.611
- Well, they're the
same thing aren't they?

55:23.053 --> 55:25.521
- I've gotta get to the gym.

55:26.589 --> 55:29.525
- Now I could give you
a much better workout

55:29.527 --> 55:31.994
than you are ever gonna get.

55:49.346 --> 55:52.281
- You know me and my
background, right?

55:52.283 --> 55:56.585
I mean, I haven't always
hung around model citizens.

55:58.188 --> 56:00.789
- Yeah, so you're not a priest.

56:00.791 --> 56:05.027
If you were, you wouldn't be
able to do that thing I like.

56:06.396 --> 56:07.363
- Listen,

56:07.365 --> 56:10.833
because of the fighting
I do, I run into guys

56:10.835 --> 56:15.137
that might try to get at me
by hurting those around me.

56:19.442 --> 56:21.977
Just be careful and keep
your eyes open, okay?

56:21.979 --> 56:25.280
- Do I look like a
valley girl to you?

56:26.583 --> 56:30.586
- I'm serious, promise me
you'll keep your eyes open.

56:30.588 --> 56:33.288
- Yeah, I'll keep my eyes open.

56:40.029 --> 56:42.431
When am I gonna see you again?

56:42.433 --> 56:44.400
- Soon, I'll call you.

56:49.372 --> 56:50.773
Oh, by the way,

56:55.645 --> 56:56.945
I do love you.

57:03.319 --> 57:04.420
I'll see ya.

57:23.306 --> 57:24.139
- Can I help you, sir?

57:24.141 --> 57:25.141
- Yeah.

57:34.751 --> 57:37.219
Get the fuck up, let's move!

57:38.521 --> 57:40.522
Let's go, let's fucking
move don't make me shoot!

57:40.524 --> 57:42.224
- Let's go, get the fuck down!

57:42.226 --> 57:43.226
Let's go!

57:44.294 --> 57:46.528
- I'm gonna pee my pants!

57:47.831 --> 57:49.698
- You're so cute,
just put the money in the bag,

57:49.700 --> 57:51.066
okay?

57:51.068 --> 57:52.434
Put the money in
the bag, alright?

57:52.436 --> 57:54.336
Let's go, there you go,
come on put the money

57:54.338 --> 57:55.537
in the bag.

57:55.539 --> 57:58.574
- Get the fuck up and let's go!

58:00.009 --> 58:01.043
60 seconds!

58:04.714 --> 58:06.782
Get the fuck down, go, go, go.

58:15.458 --> 58:16.525
30 seconds!

58:28.638 --> 58:30.005
Don't you fucking move!

58:30.007 --> 58:33.275
- Get the fuck down!

58:33.277 --> 58:37.579
- Thank you very
much, this bank is closed!

59:18.955 --> 59:19.955
- Went smooth I take it?

59:19.957 --> 59:21.490
- Very.

59:21.492 --> 59:24.059
- Jason and I'll get
the money ready to move,

59:24.061 --> 59:26.428
we gotta turn this quickly.

59:29.632 --> 59:31.166
- Son of a bitch.

59:32.569 --> 59:35.337
There's a dye-pack in this one.

59:35.339 --> 59:37.839
Half this money is
marked, it's no good.

59:37.841 --> 59:40.008
- Close it, burn it.

59:40.010 --> 59:44.313
Take the three good bags,
we'll count the money later.

59:52.689 --> 59:54.222
- Massage?

59:54.224 --> 59:56.592
- We're health inspectors,
there's been an emergency,

59:56.594 --> 59:59.962
we need everyone out
of here right now.

01:00:01.497 --> 01:00:03.665
I said everyone out now.

01:00:03.667 --> 01:00:06.234
- You heard the boss, out now!
- Move it, let's go!

01:00:06.236 --> 01:00:08.170
- Let's go, everybody out, now,

01:00:08.172 --> 01:00:10.138
let's go, outside!

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.608
Lady, outside let's go.

01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:13.709
Outside!

01:00:13.711 --> 01:00:16.078
You too, outside, let's go!

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:23.452
- What the hell is going on?

01:00:23.454 --> 01:00:27.255
- I don't think we need
to do anything rash.

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:29.791
Very impressed.

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:33.729
You're very talented Johnny.

01:00:33.731 --> 01:00:36.965
Looks like you've
found a profession

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:40.702
where you can make all
of us a good living.

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:44.272
- What are you talking about?

01:00:45.675 --> 01:00:50.212
- We're all business
men here, just like you.

01:00:50.214 --> 01:00:52.347
Let's put the guns down.

01:00:58.755 --> 01:01:03.058
Johnny here owes us money
and we're here to collect it.

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.428
- Money's in the
back, it's no good.

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:08.397
It's marked, dye-pack.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.468
- Well that's too
bad, that means

01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:15.871
you two have a new problem.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:19.708
Your partner here owes
us a lot of money,

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:23.045
two million dollars to be exact.

01:01:23.047 --> 01:01:25.013
And I'm beginning to
believe he's not gonna be

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:26.581
able to cover it.

01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:31.053
And since he works with
you two, that makes it

01:01:31.055 --> 01:01:32.487
your problem.

01:01:32.489 --> 01:01:34.556
And your debt, as well.

01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:39.294
Now we can take care of
this in a civilized manner.

01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:41.897
Or we can take care of it
the way my two associates

01:01:41.899 --> 01:01:44.700
would like to take care
of it which involves

01:01:44.702 --> 01:01:48.970
breaking things and
hurting family members

01:01:48.972 --> 01:01:52.574
and informing the FBI
that maybe they should be

01:01:52.576 --> 01:01:54.810
arresting certain people.

01:01:56.646 --> 01:01:58.714
Or we can do it my way,

01:02:00.016 --> 01:02:02.551
which is working something
out where we can get the money

01:02:02.553 --> 01:02:05.620
into my hands by the
end of this week.

01:02:05.622 --> 01:02:08.423
- Now hold on a second,
you said I had until

01:02:08.425 --> 01:02:10.392
my next fight.

01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:12.394
- Change of plans.

01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:16.465
I'm ready to get out
of this shit hole town.

01:02:16.467 --> 01:02:18.867
- Everybody just calm down.

01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:24.106
Now today was a trial run.

01:02:24.108 --> 01:02:27.042
Next week we're pulling off
a score where we can all

01:02:27.044 --> 01:02:28.510
retire in style.

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:31.813
Do you wanna pass that up?

01:02:31.815 --> 01:02:33.615
- Go on.

01:02:33.617 --> 01:02:36.518
- We'll contact
you at a location

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:41.089
and we'll bring you two
million in cash, unmarked.

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:44.059
And then Johnny's
debt is cleared.

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:48.997
- We know where you live.

01:02:48.999 --> 01:02:50.532
We know your wife

01:02:52.034 --> 01:02:56.571
and Johnny we know your
girlfriend and your son

01:02:56.573 --> 01:03:00.876
and I don't think any of them
want you to fuck this up.

01:03:14.924 --> 01:03:16.558
- What's going on?

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:20.662
- Joe mccray is a
bookie from Vegas.

01:03:20.664 --> 01:03:23.265
I borrowed money from
him before my last fight

01:03:23.267 --> 01:03:25.500
so I could bet on myself.

01:03:27.837 --> 01:03:30.572
- Eric and the
bookie are friends.

01:03:30.574 --> 01:03:33.108
Maybe Eric's been talking.

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:34.342
- Who's Eric?

01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:41.850
- Five robberies, six
sweeps, and no fucking leads.

01:03:41.852 --> 01:03:43.552
Nobody's that good.

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:45.787
- Miller.

01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:47.722
I've got a friend in the NYPD,

01:03:47.724 --> 01:03:49.791
a few years ago he had
a case that was similar

01:03:49.793 --> 01:03:51.393
to this one.

01:03:51.395 --> 01:03:55.030
Three black males dressed
as white NYPD detectives

01:03:55.032 --> 01:03:56.364
rob a bank.

01:03:56.366 --> 01:03:59.734
Case goes on for weeks,
then months, no leads.

01:03:59.736 --> 01:04:00.569
Nothing.

01:04:00.571 --> 01:04:02.037
- So how'd they get 'em?

01:04:02.039 --> 01:04:04.072
- One of the knuckleheads
writes a letter

01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:06.675
to the mask company, he
thanks them for making

01:04:06.677 --> 01:04:08.210
such great masks.

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:13.114
- Really?

01:04:13.116 --> 01:04:15.183
- For 1,000 bucks you can
have you identity changed,

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:16.218
completely.

01:04:18.087 --> 01:04:19.554
- Well their m.O

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.591
is that they're only
robbing the Kansas City

01:04:22.593 --> 01:04:27.128
banks that have branches that
are close to the interstate.

01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:30.899
This one was in like a half
a mile from an on-ramp.

01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:32.968
- What about the fighter?

01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:35.403
- The fighter, who's that?

01:04:35.405 --> 01:04:37.606
- It's Johnny Thompson,
he's from this area,

01:04:37.608 --> 01:04:39.674
he's been training in
Vegas for several months.

01:04:39.676 --> 01:04:42.611
Just had a fight in
Vegas, big fight,

01:04:42.613 --> 01:04:45.080
got his ass kicked, came
back home got busted

01:04:45.082 --> 01:04:48.550
for domestic violence, posted
bail, out in the streets

01:04:48.552 --> 01:04:50.218
within hours.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:51.620
- Does he have a record?

01:04:51.622 --> 01:04:54.389
- Oh hell yeah, he
spent several years in

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:58.827
the state penitentiary for
accessory to armed robbery.

01:04:58.829 --> 01:05:01.696
He and his two partners
robbed a convenience store.

01:05:01.698 --> 01:05:03.498
They didn't know
the clerk had a gun.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.867
One of his partners turned
his back on his way out,

01:05:05.869 --> 01:05:07.535
a guy named Steve Winston.

01:05:07.537 --> 01:05:11.106
The clerk shot him in the
back, put him in a wheelchair.

01:05:11.108 --> 01:05:13.808
Johnny and this Winston guy
never ratted on the other guy

01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:15.810
so he's still out there.

01:05:15.812 --> 01:05:19.014
Ironically his dad
was also a fighter

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:21.583
and a bank robber.

01:05:21.585 --> 01:05:24.452
Got killed in the bank
heist back in the 80s.

01:05:24.454 --> 01:05:27.422
After Thompson got out of
jail, he went back to the gym,

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:30.158
trained, eventually turned pro.

01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:34.896
- Miller, we can put
a tail on Johnny.

01:05:34.898 --> 01:05:37.565
We follow him, find out
who he's running with,

01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:41.803
we'll ID his whole crew,
and every player in it.

01:05:55.918 --> 01:05:58.186
- Where you been?

01:05:58.188 --> 01:06:02.958
- Oh you know, out with
the girls, little shopping.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.626
We saw a movie.

01:06:04.628 --> 01:06:07.162
- What movie did you see?

01:06:07.164 --> 01:06:10.298
- Just some comedy, I'll
say it wasn't very funny.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.599
- Who was in it?

01:06:11.601 --> 01:06:13.301
- Ben stiller, why?

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:17.238
- That's strange, I didn't
realize he had a movie

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.074
out right now.

01:06:19.076 --> 01:06:20.809
- What are you doing, Jason?

01:06:20.811 --> 01:06:22.077
- I'm just trying to
have a conversation

01:06:22.079 --> 01:06:23.311
with my wife.

01:06:29.285 --> 01:06:30.285
So, uh,

01:06:31.187 --> 01:06:33.355
where'd you really go?

01:06:33.357 --> 01:06:35.657
- I'll tell you what,
why don't you follow me

01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:37.158
around tomorrow?

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.894
Then you can see where I
go and what I do everyday.

01:06:39.896 --> 01:06:40.896
Okay?

01:06:43.866 --> 01:06:46.001
- Where did you go, Kristen?

01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:47.635
- Fuck off, Jason.

01:06:48.904 --> 01:06:52.507
- Is he the first, or is
he just one in a long line?

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:54.175
- I think the fumes
at the nail salon

01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:56.611
are starting to fuck
with your brain a little.

01:06:56.613 --> 01:06:57.712
- You know what?

01:06:57.714 --> 01:06:58.546
- What?

01:06:58.548 --> 01:07:00.215
- You're a whore.

01:07:00.217 --> 01:07:01.750
You're no better than the
whores we have working

01:07:01.752 --> 01:07:04.119
in the salon, we have
an opening, no interview

01:07:04.121 --> 01:07:06.087
required for you.

01:07:06.089 --> 01:07:08.556
- At least I'm not a faggot.

01:07:09.759 --> 01:07:11.693
- The fuck did you say to me?

01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:14.662
- I said, you are a faggot.

01:07:14.664 --> 01:07:18.533
- You and your dad,
running that nail salon.

01:07:18.535 --> 01:07:20.502
You're a fucking joke.

01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:22.537
- You fucking bitch!

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:24.939
- Get off me!

01:07:24.941 --> 01:07:26.174
I'll call the FBI,
- oh yeah?

01:07:26.176 --> 01:07:27.008
- I swear to god!

01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:28.243
- Yeah, yeah?

01:07:30.646 --> 01:07:31.813
- Stop it!

01:07:31.815 --> 01:07:33.048
Let go of me!

01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:35.083
- I want you to
get out, you hear me?

01:07:35.085 --> 01:07:37.052
I want you to get out!

01:07:38.988 --> 01:07:41.956
Get your shit and
get out of here!

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:47.862
- If anyone's leaving, it's you.

01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:53.768
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:56.004
- You're god damn right, I will.

01:07:56.006 --> 01:07:59.107
- Fine, your ass is
gonna be in prison once

01:07:59.109 --> 01:08:03.178
I tell them what's been
going on in that salon.

01:08:05.614 --> 01:08:07.816
- You think Eric is a
Saint, what the fuck do you

01:08:07.818 --> 01:08:11.386
think we've been
conducting business for?

01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:24.866
- Hello?

01:08:24.868 --> 01:08:27.068
- Eric, Joe mccray.

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:28.069
- Hey Joe.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.738
Good seeing you the other night,

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:33.441
I thought you said you
wouldn't be caught dead here,

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:35.443
why are you here anyway?

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:38.212
- Business, you gotta
go where the money is.

01:08:41.184 --> 01:08:44.185
- Like there's a lot for
you here in Kansas City.

01:08:44.187 --> 01:08:46.720
- Listen, I'm gonna be
coming into quite a bit

01:08:46.723 --> 01:08:50.058
of money here in the next
few days and I could use

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:53.394
your help deciding
what to do with it.

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:54.828
- Yeah sure.

01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:56.731
- I don't wanna talk
about this over the phone

01:08:56.733 --> 01:09:00.335
so I'm out here in the
parking lot, I'm wondering if

01:09:00.337 --> 01:09:02.904
I could come in, talk awhile.

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:05.707
- Sure whatever I
could do to help.

01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:06.640
- Okay.

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:08.843
- I'll see ya in a minute.

01:09:20.089 --> 01:09:21.589
- May I help you?

01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:25.560
- Yes I'm Joe mccray
here to see Eric Hoffman.

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:29.564
- Okay, just a moment please.

01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:33.968
A Joe mccray is here to see you.

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:36.638
Sure, I'll send him back.

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:37.705
You can go on in.

01:09:37.707 --> 01:09:38.840
- Thank you.

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:43.243
Nice tattoo.

01:09:48.785 --> 01:09:50.018
- Joe mccray,
- hi Eric,

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:51.118
nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

01:09:51.121 --> 01:09:53.188
Come on in, come on in.

01:09:57.593 --> 01:09:59.961
So, how can I help you Joe?

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:05.667
- Oh the usual, got
some money to clean up.

01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:07.635
- How much we talking?

01:10:07.637 --> 01:10:09.137
- Two million.

01:10:09.139 --> 01:10:11.139
- Two million?

01:10:11.141 --> 01:10:13.441
Let me guess, investments?

01:10:15.045 --> 01:10:15.977
- Hey.

01:10:15.979 --> 01:10:17.212
- May I help you?

01:10:17.214 --> 01:10:18.413
- I need to speak
to Eric Hoffman.

01:10:18.415 --> 01:10:20.415
- Okay, do you have
an appointment?

01:10:20.417 --> 01:10:22.350
- I didn't think I needed one.

01:10:22.352 --> 01:10:25.920
- We've got a real
nice piece of property

01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:28.489
we'd like to buy in Vegas.

01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:30.225
- Well I'm sorry but if you
don't have an appointment...

01:10:30.227 --> 01:10:32.026
- just pick up the
fucking phone and tell him

01:10:32.028 --> 01:10:33.428
Kristen's here.

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:35.530
- Okay.

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:38.466
- Nice.

01:10:39.336 --> 01:10:40.969
Oh, just a minute.

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:42.904
Yeah?

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:46.040
Who?

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:50.245
Tell her to give
me just a minute.

01:10:50.247 --> 01:10:51.713
- Sure, alright.

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:58.219
- He said he'll
be right with you.

01:10:59.755 --> 01:11:01.089
Would you like to have a seat?

01:11:01.091 --> 01:11:02.590
- No, I'm fine.

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:05.693
- Somebody robbing the bank or...

01:11:05.695 --> 01:11:06.695
- shit.

01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:11.532
- Hey, hey, isn't that that
wife of that guy that owns

01:11:11.534 --> 01:11:12.934
the nail salon?

01:11:15.137 --> 01:11:16.337
- Yeah it is.

01:11:18.975 --> 01:11:22.844
- You son of a bitch, you're
nailing that aren't you?

01:11:22.846 --> 01:11:27.181
You know I was in the nail
salon a couple days ago.

01:11:27.183 --> 01:11:28.183
Nice place.

01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:31.686
- What are you doing
at his nail salon?

01:11:31.688 --> 01:11:33.254
- Business.

01:11:33.256 --> 01:11:34.289
- What'd you get?

01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:36.624
A pedicure or a sucky-fucky?

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:39.827
- Well, you know, I
figure I'm in Kansas City

01:11:39.829 --> 01:11:42.930
I might as well look
good and feel good

01:11:42.932 --> 01:11:44.465
at the same time.

01:11:45.434 --> 01:11:47.001
- That's kinda weird,
don't you think?

01:11:47.003 --> 01:11:49.771
- Not as weird as you
fucking the wife of one

01:11:49.773 --> 01:11:51.406
of your customers.

01:11:52.174 --> 01:11:54.642
- Well she's a customer too.

01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:57.912
- That's even more fucked up.

01:11:57.914 --> 01:11:59.113
- Not really.

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:04.185
- Oh mercy, you know
what I'm starting to like

01:12:04.187 --> 01:12:05.286
Kansas City.

01:12:06.855 --> 01:12:08.556
- Well, you should.

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:11.192
Just a minute.

01:12:11.194 --> 01:12:12.194
Yeah?

01:12:13.095 --> 01:12:14.562
- What?

01:12:14.564 --> 01:12:15.963
Well,

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:16.965
stop her.

01:12:21.538 --> 01:12:24.038
- You want me to get that?

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.139
- No.

01:12:27.243 --> 01:12:28.743
- How long are you
gonna make me wait?

01:12:28.745 --> 01:12:30.411
Jesus Christ.

01:12:30.413 --> 01:12:32.814
- I'm in a meeting Kristen.

01:12:34.049 --> 01:12:36.451
- Could we
have some privacy please?

01:12:36.453 --> 01:12:39.187
- Uh, I was just leaving.

01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:42.190
I'll call you on that later on.

01:12:42.192 --> 01:12:43.491
And good luck.

01:12:46.228 --> 01:12:47.929
- He knows.

01:12:47.931 --> 01:12:48.763
- Who?

01:12:48.765 --> 01:12:49.597
Knows what?

01:12:49.599 --> 01:12:51.866
- Jason, about us.

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:54.068
He knows about us.

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:56.738
- You're just being paranoid,
he doesn't know shit.

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.639
- Trust me, he knows.

01:12:58.641 --> 01:13:01.175
- Have a good day.

01:13:01.177 --> 01:13:04.312
- But I found out something
you might be interested in.

01:13:04.314 --> 01:13:06.280
- Really, what's that?

01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:21.362
- I think I know how they're
buying all this real estate.

01:13:21.364 --> 01:13:25.266
And I have an idea how
we can leave Kansas City

01:13:25.268 --> 01:13:27.068
and be set for life.

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:36.210
- Wait a second.

01:13:36.212 --> 01:13:38.079
I recognize that guy.

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:40.882
He was at the gym the
other day claiming to be

01:13:40.884 --> 01:13:42.650
an attorney.

01:13:42.652 --> 01:13:45.253
- He's obviously
not an attorney.

01:13:45.255 --> 01:13:47.221
- Son of a bitch.

01:13:47.223 --> 01:13:49.657
Did Eric fucking rat us out?

01:13:49.659 --> 01:13:51.526
- Listen pretty lady.

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:56.631
I have no complaints.

01:13:58.167 --> 01:14:00.968
And I've got no reason to leave.

01:14:03.572 --> 01:14:04.572
- Fine.

01:14:21.323 --> 01:14:23.224
- Excuse me.

01:14:27.029 --> 01:14:29.530
- What the hell
is she doing here?

01:14:29.532 --> 01:14:31.599
- I'm Ryan Miller,
special agent, FBI,

01:14:31.601 --> 01:14:33.000
where can I find Eric Hoffman?

01:14:33.002 --> 01:14:34.969
- Let me see if he's available.

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:38.039
- No, just point me
towards his office.

01:14:38.041 --> 01:14:40.208
- Do you want me to follow her?

01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:42.910
- No, I'll deal with her later.

01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:48.749
- Eric Hoffman?

01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:51.152
- Yes, how many I help you?

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:53.454
- My name is Ryan Miller,
I'm a special agent

01:14:53.456 --> 01:14:55.056
with the FBI.

01:14:55.058 --> 01:14:57.859
We are here to conduct
an internal audit.

01:14:57.861 --> 01:15:01.496
Are you the person
we need to speak to?

01:15:01.498 --> 01:15:02.964
- Yes, yes I am.

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:19.614
- Hello?

01:15:19.616 --> 01:15:21.115
- This is Eric.

01:15:21.117 --> 01:15:23.384
The FBI was just here to
conduct an internal audit,

01:15:23.386 --> 01:15:26.354
we're gonna figure out
something quick because our ass

01:15:26.356 --> 01:15:27.822
is on the line.

01:15:27.824 --> 01:15:31.492
- I don't know who this is,
but don't ever call here again.

01:15:42.805 --> 01:15:44.872
- Alright, work
your way inside Johnny.

01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:47.542
- Come on Johnny,
- use your jab to get inside.

01:15:47.544 --> 01:15:49.544
- More work Johnny.

01:15:49.546 --> 01:15:53.014
- Work your way inside Johnny.

01:16:04.493 --> 01:16:06.160
- What's up with you man?

01:16:06.162 --> 01:16:08.629
Your head ain't here man.

01:16:08.631 --> 01:16:10.731
Looking like shit!

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:12.667
Get the fuck out of my gym, man.

01:16:12.669 --> 01:16:16.971
You gonna fight right in a
corner looking like shit.

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:27.014
- You see that car over there?

01:16:27.016 --> 01:16:29.884
- The Hummer, what about it?

01:16:29.886 --> 01:16:33.387
- It's been sitting
there as long as we have.

01:16:33.389 --> 01:16:35.089
- I'll run the tag.

01:16:36.325 --> 01:16:38.125
- Any one of your guys out here?

01:16:38.127 --> 01:16:39.127
- Nope.

01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:46.934
- Airport rental,
it's not a local.

01:16:54.142 --> 01:16:56.444
- What's going on, Johnny?

01:16:57.479 --> 01:16:59.580
You been late to most of
your training sessions

01:16:59.582 --> 01:17:01.215
and when you are here it's
like your mind is somewhere

01:17:01.217 --> 01:17:02.217
else.

01:17:03.585 --> 01:17:06.120
A cop was in here
today asking about you,

01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:07.855
he wanted to know your
training schedule,

01:17:07.857 --> 01:17:10.825
if I knew where you were
on certain days and times.

01:17:10.827 --> 01:17:12.326
- Nothing I can't handle.

01:17:12.328 --> 01:17:14.128
- God Johnny, what have
you gotten yourself into

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:15.130
this time?

01:17:18.767 --> 01:17:21.002
- I gotta get my son
out of here, earnest,

01:17:21.004 --> 01:17:23.638
you can appreciate
that more than anybody.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:24.972
- What did I tell you
when you came to me

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:25.974
for help?

01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:28.476
Do you remember?

01:17:28.478 --> 01:17:31.712
I said don't let me down,
and what have you done?

01:17:31.714 --> 01:17:33.414
You've let me down.

01:17:34.983 --> 01:17:37.184
We're done here Johnny.

01:17:37.186 --> 01:17:40.087
I'd hoped you'd turn out
different than your father.

01:17:40.089 --> 01:17:41.155
We're done.

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:44.091
You're on your own.

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:48.062
- I borrowed money from
a crooked bookie in Vegas

01:17:48.064 --> 01:17:51.298
and I bet that I
would win the fight.

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:55.202
And we both know
how that turned out.

01:17:55.204 --> 01:17:58.539
- So how do you plan on
paying him the money?

01:17:58.541 --> 01:18:02.243
- I was planning on paying him
back after this next fight.

01:18:02.245 --> 01:18:04.145
But he increased my debt.

01:18:04.147 --> 01:18:05.980
- How much do you owe?

01:18:05.982 --> 01:18:07.281
- Two million.

01:18:08.717 --> 01:18:11.585
- Well don't look at me,
I'm poor and I'm black.

01:18:11.587 --> 01:18:13.320
And even if I did have
the money I wouldn't give

01:18:13.322 --> 01:18:16.857
it to a crazy ass
cracker like you anyway.

01:18:16.859 --> 01:18:17.859
Shit.

01:18:20.162 --> 01:18:23.464
- He's been here for a couple
of weeks with his two goons,

01:18:23.466 --> 01:18:25.099
waiting for me outside in
the parking lot so they

01:18:25.101 --> 01:18:26.901
can follow me when I leave.

01:18:26.903 --> 01:18:29.770
If I don't get him the money
in the next couple weeks,

01:18:29.772 --> 01:18:34.075
he's gonna kill my son, and
I'm not gonna let that happen.

01:18:35.177 --> 01:18:36.844
- How in the hell are
you gonna come up with

01:18:36.846 --> 01:18:38.646
two million dollars?

01:18:39.581 --> 01:18:41.682
- I've got a plan.

01:18:41.684 --> 01:18:43.751
But I need your help
getting out of here.

01:18:43.753 --> 01:18:46.387
- I can't have them follow me.

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:53.227
- Here he comes.

01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:55.196
- Hello, Johnny.

01:18:59.135 --> 01:19:00.935
- I just wanted to
let you guys know,

01:19:00.937 --> 01:19:03.337
your front tire, it's flat.

01:19:07.577 --> 01:19:09.977
- Oh what the hell is this?

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:14.815
Easy, not yet, not yet,
let's see what happens.

01:19:14.817 --> 01:19:17.585
- What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

01:19:17.587 --> 01:19:18.953
- You wouldn't harm the
hand that feeds you,

01:19:18.955 --> 01:19:20.888
now would you?

01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:22.990
It's your choice.

01:19:22.992 --> 01:19:25.826
You can choose to be all
over YouTube within seconds

01:19:25.828 --> 01:19:29.864
or you can get back in the
car and wait for a tow truck.

01:19:29.866 --> 01:19:32.500
- If you run, I will find you.

01:19:33.802 --> 01:19:37.772
Before I find you I'll do
everything I said I'd do

01:19:37.774 --> 01:19:39.874
if I don't get my money.

01:19:39.876 --> 01:19:42.243
Just remember that.

01:19:42.245 --> 01:19:46.213
- Don't forget to wave,
you're streaming live.

01:20:10.372 --> 01:20:12.640
- There a problem?

01:20:12.642 --> 01:20:14.341
- I'm with the FBI.

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:26.053
- Gentlemen,
can I get anything else

01:20:26.055 --> 01:20:27.288
for you tonight?

01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:28.322
- No we're good, thank you.

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:30.357
- Thank you.

01:20:36.932 --> 01:20:41.769
- The FBI is closing in, we
need to disappear, like ghosts.

01:20:41.771 --> 01:20:44.371
We can't go home,
can't go to work,

01:20:44.373 --> 01:20:46.473
and after we leave
this place tonight,

01:20:46.475 --> 01:20:48.275
we can't be seen in public
until we finish this

01:20:48.277 --> 01:20:52.012
next job, then we leave
this city for good.

01:20:52.781 --> 01:20:54.682
You guys got somewhere to go?

01:20:54.684 --> 01:20:56.517
- How long is gonna take for
the FBI to track the money

01:20:56.519 --> 01:20:58.052
back to us?

01:20:58.054 --> 01:21:00.020
- I don't have a clue.

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:03.924
Johnny have you heard
from the las Vegas bookie?

01:21:03.926 --> 01:21:06.727
- Yeah, they're kinda
stuck at the moment.

01:21:06.729 --> 01:21:08.762
- What do you mean?

01:21:08.764 --> 01:21:11.098
- They were waiting
for me outside my gym,

01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:13.601
so I slashed their tire.

01:21:13.603 --> 01:21:14.603
- Nice.

01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:19.306
We're gonna have to find
a way to deal with them.

01:21:19.308 --> 01:21:20.941
Even if they take their
cut, they're always

01:21:20.943 --> 01:21:23.711
gonna be hanging over us.

01:21:23.713 --> 01:21:27.581
Brendan, you sure you
got a place to lie low?

01:21:28.817 --> 01:21:30.451
- I'll be alright.

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:34.188
- Focus on the job
first, then we'll decide

01:21:34.190 --> 01:21:36.957
how we're gonna handle it.

01:21:36.959 --> 01:21:38.259
Anything else?

01:21:40.295 --> 01:21:41.829
- Nah, that's it.

01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:43.864
- Alright.

01:21:43.866 --> 01:21:46.333
You guys know what to do.

01:21:46.335 --> 01:21:48.702
I'll see ya when it's over.

01:21:51.373 --> 01:21:53.874
- Johnny and I are gonna
stick around for a minute,

01:21:53.876 --> 01:21:55.609
talk some business.

01:22:03.952 --> 01:22:05.886
- Joe's never gonna let us be.

01:22:05.888 --> 01:22:08.022
Until he has everything.

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:13.394
- Well, we all have
our problems, don't we.

01:22:13.396 --> 01:22:17.131
You have Joe and I have
an unfaithful wife.

01:22:29.277 --> 01:22:30.978
- Seriously?

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:35.282
You're gonna hold me over
an unregistered firearm?

01:22:36.685 --> 01:22:38.986
We're not in Vegas
anymore, Toto.

01:22:38.988 --> 01:22:41.989
- Joseph mccray, a
bookie from Vegas,

01:22:41.991 --> 01:22:45.459
you've lived a pretty
colorful lifestyle.

01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:48.662
Arrested in '95 for assault,
'96 for attempted murder,

01:22:48.664 --> 01:22:50.798
served two years
for the state pen.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:55.102
Out on parole, Dallas 2000,
busted again for fraud

01:22:55.104 --> 01:22:56.670
and embezzlement.

01:22:58.173 --> 01:23:00.808
Your parents must be proud.

01:23:00.810 --> 01:23:04.678
- My father told me,
you do what you gotta do

01:23:07.248 --> 01:23:10.484
to support the
lifestyle you deserve.

01:23:12.687 --> 01:23:15.422
- What are you doing
in Kansas City?

01:23:15.424 --> 01:23:17.858
- I hear they got some
crazy little women here

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:19.293
and I'm gonna get me one.

01:23:19.295 --> 01:23:20.828
- No, no, no, let's
do this again.

01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:24.231
What the fuck are you
doing in Kansas City?

01:23:24.233 --> 01:23:27.001
- They tell me ugly
mother fuckers like you

01:23:27.003 --> 01:23:28.435
can get laid around here,

01:23:28.437 --> 01:23:29.937
is that true?

01:23:29.939 --> 01:23:31.472
Go fuck yourself.

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:34.441
- So you think
Thompson's got money,

01:23:34.443 --> 01:23:37.544
and you and the Frankenstein
brothers are gonna collect.

01:23:37.546 --> 01:23:39.947
How you plan on doing that?

01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:43.150
We found three unregistered
guns in the trunk of

01:23:43.152 --> 01:23:46.653
your car, even for an
ex-con like you, pal,

01:23:46.655 --> 01:23:48.122
that's a felony.

01:23:48.124 --> 01:23:52.526
- That's 15 years Joe, a
mandatory minimum of 15 years,

01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:54.795
federal time, that means
no parole and you'll do

01:23:54.797 --> 01:23:56.597
every single day.

01:23:56.599 --> 01:23:58.132
- I'm running out of time.

01:23:58.134 --> 01:24:01.035
I'm tired of fucking
with lowlifes like you.

01:24:01.037 --> 01:24:03.337
So here's what we're gonna do.

01:24:03.339 --> 01:24:07.441
You help me catch Johnny
Thompson and his crew

01:24:07.443 --> 01:24:10.144
and I'll tell the
atf to back off.

01:24:10.146 --> 01:24:12.880
Otherwise I'm gonna watch
you squirm like the little

01:24:12.882 --> 01:24:15.482
cockroach you are while
the full extent of the law

01:24:15.484 --> 01:24:18.886
comes down on you
like a ton of bricks.

01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:31.799
- Can I come in?

01:24:40.508 --> 01:24:42.676
- Where have you been?

01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:44.445
- The last time I talked
to you you told me that you

01:24:44.447 --> 01:24:46.213
might be in some sort of
trouble and that I should

01:24:46.215 --> 01:24:47.648
watch my back.

01:24:47.650 --> 01:24:51.218
And then I don't hear
from you until now.

01:24:57.659 --> 01:24:58.926
- I'm sorry.

01:24:58.928 --> 01:25:00.627
Will you hear me out?

01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:03.997
- Does it look like
I'm going anywhere?

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:16.810
- I'm gonna tell you
everything that's happened

01:25:16.812 --> 01:25:20.647
since I left Vegas and
what I'm about to do

01:25:20.649 --> 01:25:23.484
and I need you to promise
me that you'll think

01:25:23.486 --> 01:25:27.054
very hard before you
agree or disagree

01:25:27.056 --> 01:25:29.189
with what I'm about to ask you.

01:25:29.191 --> 01:25:33.560
If you agree, you can never
come back to Kansas City.

01:25:33.562 --> 01:25:37.364
And you have to leave
this apartment tonight

01:25:38.366 --> 01:25:42.569
but I promise you,
Rachel, I can and I will

01:25:42.571 --> 01:25:44.251
take care of you for
the rest of our lives.

01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:49.576
- Unbelievable.

01:25:49.578 --> 01:25:51.812
You need to listen to me.

01:25:51.814 --> 01:25:54.815
Do you know why I chased you
down in that parking lot?

01:25:54.817 --> 01:25:56.750
It wasn't because I wanted
to rekindle whatever

01:25:56.752 --> 01:26:01.054
this shit is that we have,
this fucked up relationship.

01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:07.227
It's because I needed closure.

01:26:12.767 --> 01:26:16.470
I waited for you while
you were in prison

01:26:16.472 --> 01:26:18.405
and then you up and leave,
cut me out of your life

01:26:18.407 --> 01:26:20.874
to start a new one in Vegas.

01:26:21.943 --> 01:26:23.877
You can't just do that,
you can't just walk into

01:26:23.879 --> 01:26:26.313
people's lives at
your own convenience.

01:26:26.315 --> 01:26:28.549
It doesn't work that way.

01:26:31.252 --> 01:26:33.387
And then, like an idiot,

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:37.858
I took you into my home.

01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:40.027
Realized how much I
missed you and how lonely

01:26:40.029 --> 01:26:41.029
I've been.

01:26:42.664 --> 01:26:45.232
And I fucking sleep with you.

01:26:50.772 --> 01:26:53.574
When I was in high school,
I used to sneak out of my

01:26:53.576 --> 01:26:56.143
mom's apartment in the
middle of the night

01:26:56.145 --> 01:27:01.114
and I'd go and sit on the
sidewalk facing the street.

01:27:01.116 --> 01:27:04.785
I would stare at the cars
passing and just hope to catch

01:27:04.787 --> 01:27:09.289
a glimpse of my dads
beat up old pickup truck.

01:27:09.291 --> 01:27:10.924
You see, by then you
think I would've been old

01:27:10.926 --> 01:27:15.229
enough to realize that he was
probably never coming back.

01:27:16.264 --> 01:27:18.365
But it didn't stop
me from waiting,

01:27:18.367 --> 01:27:20.467
just like it didn't stop me
from running to the mailbox

01:27:20.469 --> 01:27:23.070
every birthday and every
Christmas for a card

01:27:23.072 --> 01:27:25.639
or a letter or some
slight indication

01:27:25.641 --> 01:27:28.642
that he gave a shit about us.

01:27:28.644 --> 01:27:32.946
Despite all that disappointment
after disappointment,

01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:37.317
I never stopped loving him.

01:27:40.688 --> 01:27:43.423
Does that remind you of anyone?

01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:50.631
If I listen to whatever
scheme you've gotten yourself

01:27:50.633 --> 01:27:51.999
into this time,

01:27:53.368 --> 01:27:56.436
if I change my
entire life for you,

01:27:57.772 --> 01:28:01.241
I can't be the only
one that changes.

01:28:01.243 --> 01:28:03.977
I love you Johnny, but I'll
be damned before I spend

01:28:03.979 --> 01:28:05.579
one more day waiting on
someone who doesn't make

01:28:05.581 --> 01:28:06.880
me a priority.

01:28:10.652 --> 01:28:11.952
- Never again.

01:28:36.678 --> 01:28:38.412
- Unlock the trunk.

01:28:54.362 --> 01:28:56.430
I'll be in in a minute.

01:29:16.150 --> 01:29:17.284
Let's do it.

01:29:34.969 --> 01:29:38.071
Well, four million in
the vault and we retire

01:29:38.073 --> 01:29:39.073
in style.

01:29:49.117 --> 01:29:50.684
- Hi, how may I help you?

01:29:50.686 --> 01:29:54.955
Oh, let me guess, you're
here to see Eric Hoffman?

01:29:54.957 --> 01:29:57.591
He's in the vaults back there.

01:30:03.331 --> 01:30:06.333
- Hey babe, guess
what I'm looking at?

01:30:06.335 --> 01:30:07.401
Our future.

01:30:14.976 --> 01:30:19.279
Meet me at the house in two
hours, I'll explain later.

01:30:24.385 --> 01:30:25.886
- Going somewhere?

01:30:25.888 --> 01:30:27.354
- Look I already told you
guys everything you need

01:30:27.356 --> 01:30:28.755
to know, including the
names of the guys I'm

01:30:28.757 --> 01:30:32.726
helping with the loans,
what more do you want?

01:30:34.595 --> 01:30:36.530
- You know Hoffman, I can
understand you wanting

01:30:36.532 --> 01:30:39.766
to fuck my wife, I
can understand you

01:30:39.768 --> 01:30:43.403
wanting to get greedy,
take money, retire.

01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:49.676
One thing I can't
stand, is a snitch.

01:30:53.916 --> 01:30:54.916
- Jason?

01:30:56.517 --> 01:30:57.884
- In the flesh.

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:04.925
Let's dance.

01:31:04.927 --> 01:31:05.927
- No, no, no.

01:31:09.564 --> 01:31:11.731
- Get up, get the fuck up.

01:31:17.238 --> 01:31:19.973
I'll snap your neck
you piece of shit.

01:31:19.975 --> 01:31:22.509
- Think you can come into
my bank, push me around?

01:31:22.511 --> 01:31:23.511
- Yep.

01:31:25.112 --> 01:31:28.982
Honestly, you're not going
anywhere you piece of shit.

01:31:28.984 --> 01:31:32.219
- You won't get away with this.

01:31:40.062 --> 01:31:42.062
- Piece of shit.

01:31:42.064 --> 01:31:43.697
- Alright.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.801
I'll see you in two,

01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:51.271
maybe 10 minutes.

01:31:56.043 --> 01:31:58.411
- You're wasting your time.

01:31:59.714 --> 01:32:02.449
Soon as you leave, the
bank employees will come in

01:32:02.451 --> 01:32:03.683
and untie me.

01:32:05.854 --> 01:32:08.622
What are you gonna do with that?

01:32:08.624 --> 01:32:11.224
- Before I do this,
I want you to know

01:32:11.226 --> 01:32:15.228
how much pleasure I'm
going to get from it.

01:32:15.230 --> 01:32:16.263
- Fuck you!

01:32:17.131 --> 01:32:18.932
- No, fuck you!

01:32:18.934 --> 01:32:20.734
You fucked our crew!

01:32:21.969 --> 01:32:23.703
Now it's your turn.

01:32:23.705 --> 01:32:26.039
- I don't give a
fuck about your crew!

01:32:27.409 --> 01:32:29.009
No, no, no, no, no!

01:32:43.524 --> 01:32:45.792
- Stay with me, stay with me.

01:32:45.794 --> 01:32:46.726
There's more coming.

01:32:46.728 --> 01:32:47.928
- No, no, no!

01:32:50.131 --> 01:32:50.964
No!

01:32:50.966 --> 01:32:51.966
No, no!

01:32:53.768 --> 01:32:55.468
No, no, stop, stop!

01:33:04.278 --> 01:33:06.446
- Feel like you need
to catch your breath?

01:33:06.448 --> 01:33:09.149
- No more, Jason wait a minute.

01:33:13.554 --> 01:33:16.089
You're a business man, right?

01:33:17.525 --> 01:33:21.761
You don't act out on
emotion, you're smart and...

01:33:22.997 --> 01:33:26.132
You're about dollars
and cents, huh?

01:33:28.903 --> 01:33:33.406
I have five million dollars
in an offshore account,

01:33:33.408 --> 01:33:35.875
it's yours, you can have it.

01:33:37.578 --> 01:33:41.047
Five million I'll give
it to you for all the

01:33:41.049 --> 01:33:44.985
trouble I've cause you, put
you and your crew through.

01:33:44.987 --> 01:33:46.753
Huh? What do you say?

01:33:46.755 --> 01:33:47.755
Huh?

01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:51.191
- I'm gonna have
to think about it.

01:33:51.193 --> 01:33:52.592
- No, no, fuck!

01:33:54.495 --> 01:33:55.562
Shit!

01:33:57.399 --> 01:33:58.399
No, no!

01:34:00.835 --> 01:34:01.835
- Oh yeah!

01:34:03.170 --> 01:34:04.170
- No!

01:34:08.876 --> 01:34:11.277
- Oh, god damn I love this.

01:34:18.119 --> 01:34:19.119
Yeah!

01:34:29.864 --> 01:34:32.599
It's time for the grand finale.

01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:38.571
- No, you're a business...

01:34:49.817 --> 01:34:50.984
- there's a bit of
a mess back there,

01:34:50.986 --> 01:34:52.519
we're gonna send
a clean up crew,

01:34:52.521 --> 01:34:53.987
Eric's working on
cleaning it up,

01:34:53.989 --> 01:34:55.689
he'll be out there for awhile.

01:34:55.691 --> 01:34:56.523
- Aright.

01:34:56.525 --> 01:34:58.491
- You have a good day.

01:35:20.081 --> 01:35:21.781
- Back up!

01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:24.884
- Who the fuck are you?

01:35:24.886 --> 01:35:26.119
Johnny send you?

01:35:26.121 --> 01:35:27.153
- Where's Caleb?

01:35:27.155 --> 01:35:28.154
- Who the hell is...

01:35:28.156 --> 01:35:29.456
- Kevin we've got company.

01:35:29.458 --> 01:35:31.958
- Both of you on the ground now.

01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:33.126
- Who the fuck are you?

01:35:33.128 --> 01:35:34.394
- On the ground.
- I don't know who the

01:35:34.396 --> 01:35:35.061
fuck she is, she just
fucking came in here...

01:35:35.063 --> 01:35:36.563
- on the ground!

01:35:36.565 --> 01:35:38.231
- Whoa, hey why don't you
get down on my face, bitch.

01:35:38.233 --> 01:35:39.899
- Get on your stomach.

01:35:39.901 --> 01:35:42.836
Hey sweetheart, tie up
your dumb ass boyfriend.

01:35:42.838 --> 01:35:44.971
- Yeah you put that
gun down I'll kick your ass.

01:35:44.973 --> 01:35:46.106
- Did I stutter, go faster!

01:35:46.108 --> 01:35:47.340
- Shut up!

01:35:47.342 --> 01:35:48.408
- And the feet.

01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:49.309
- Okay.

01:35:49.311 --> 01:35:50.343
- Turn around.

01:35:50.345 --> 01:35:52.545
On your stomach, now.

01:35:52.547 --> 01:35:54.581
Hands behind your back.

01:35:56.817 --> 01:35:58.685
_ put that gun
down, I'll kick your ass.

01:35:58.687 --> 01:36:00.186
- Legs, cross 'em.

01:36:00.188 --> 01:36:01.154
- You know you
can't take my son away,

01:36:01.156 --> 01:36:02.956
you know that right?

01:36:03.958 --> 01:36:05.125
Is that what Johnny
told you to do?

01:36:05.127 --> 01:36:06.593
You know you can't...

01:36:06.595 --> 01:36:08.094
- oh what, you're the mother
of the fucking year now?

01:36:08.096 --> 01:36:10.730
Either of you move or try
to get up, I will shoot you,

01:36:10.732 --> 01:36:12.632
do you understand me?

01:36:17.705 --> 01:36:18.705
Oh my god.

01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:23.476
Caleb, I'm going to
get you out of here.

01:36:23.478 --> 01:36:24.778
- Who are you?

01:36:26.447 --> 01:36:29.783
- I'm a friend of your fathers.

01:36:29.785 --> 01:36:30.984
- Is he here?

01:36:32.853 --> 01:36:33.853
- No.

01:36:36.557 --> 01:36:39.659
But I'm going to
take you to see him.

01:36:39.661 --> 01:36:42.061
Do you think you have
the strength to walk?

01:36:42.063 --> 01:36:43.296
- I think so.

01:36:44.265 --> 01:36:46.566
I'm just hungry and dizzy.

01:36:47.968 --> 01:36:50.537
How long have I been in here?

01:36:56.777 --> 01:37:01.047
- Alright, listen to
me, I am going to get you out

01:37:01.049 --> 01:37:05.518
of here, but I need you to do
something for me first, okay?

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:07.987
- I just want to see my dad.

01:37:08.689 --> 01:37:10.657
- You will, I promise.

01:37:11.692 --> 01:37:14.627
First, I need you
to hold my hand,

01:37:19.667 --> 01:37:21.067
and close your eyes.

01:37:21.069 --> 01:37:22.702
Do you think you can do that?

01:37:22.704 --> 01:37:23.704
Okay.

01:37:30.277 --> 01:37:31.611
- Bitch you're
not gonna get away from

01:37:31.613 --> 01:37:33.646
this you fucking whore!

01:37:56.403 --> 01:37:58.371
- Good to see you guys.

01:37:58.373 --> 01:37:59.405
- Likewise.

01:38:09.049 --> 01:38:10.049
- Well?

01:38:11.085 --> 01:38:12.785
Guess this is where
we say our goodbyes,

01:38:12.787 --> 01:38:14.420
it was nice working
with you guys.

01:38:14.422 --> 01:38:17.357
- Great working with you Johnny.

01:38:17.359 --> 01:38:18.925
- I'm not one for tears.

01:38:18.927 --> 01:38:19.826
Live the good life, brother.

01:38:19.828 --> 01:38:21.394
- You do the same.

01:38:21.396 --> 01:38:23.763
- Oh that's my kind of car.

01:38:25.466 --> 01:38:28.601
It was good working
with you guys.

01:38:28.603 --> 01:38:30.403
- Safe travels, son.

01:38:34.642 --> 01:38:36.609
- Are you ready to go?

01:39:22.022 --> 01:39:23.022
- Hi baby.

01:39:31.465 --> 01:39:32.832
- Oh, hi.

01:39:32.834 --> 01:39:35.401
Are you the clean up crew?

01:39:35.403 --> 01:39:36.803
- Excuse me?

01:39:36.805 --> 01:39:39.305
- The clean up crew, the
other agent came through

01:39:39.307 --> 01:39:41.641
here and said that he was
sending a clean up crew

01:39:41.643 --> 01:39:42.809
to clean up the vault.

01:39:42.811 --> 01:39:44.377
- Where's Hoffman?

01:39:44.379 --> 01:39:46.546
- Back in the vault, that way.

01:39:46.548 --> 01:39:47.680
- Thank you.

01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:52.885
- Yeah?

01:39:52.887 --> 01:39:54.854
- Mr.
Mccray, it's Jason.

01:39:54.856 --> 01:39:57.924
Look, I've had to change
the location of the drop.

01:39:57.926 --> 01:40:00.626
I'm gonna text you the
address, when you get there,

01:40:00.628 --> 01:40:03.062
look in the trunk in the garage.

01:40:03.064 --> 01:40:06.366
There you'll find your two
million in unmarked bills.

01:40:06.368 --> 01:40:09.802
After that, I want you to
get the fuck out of town

01:40:09.804 --> 01:40:12.238
because we're all leaving now.

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:15.708
- Well you better be
a man of your word.

01:40:32.926 --> 01:40:34.660
Damn lights are out,
let's get the cash

01:40:34.662 --> 01:40:37.230
and get the fuck out of here.

01:40:38.265 --> 01:40:40.066
I'd like to see the look
on the feds face when

01:40:40.068 --> 01:40:42.702
they realize the case is blown

01:40:43.737 --> 01:40:44.737
oh shit!

01:40:49.376 --> 01:40:50.910
You motherfucker!
