this is Kendra Zahir.

to make the acting team leader

I could count on you and that
you would show up for me.

‐Why?
‐C. C. Hastings,

04:55.540 --> 04:57.670
the development company,
is giving them cash vouchers

04:57.670 --> 04:59.500
to voluntarily move
out of their homes.

05:00.130 --> 05:01.880
If more tenants drop out,
we won't have enough

Okay, Andre. If you choose
not to participate,

06:39.230 --> 06:41.520
can you at least not disrupt
the class while I'm teaching?

06:43.400 --> 06:46.150
All right. So, for those
of you who did the reading,

06:46.150 --> 06:49.070
what is one of
the main conflicts

06:49.070 --> 06:50.110
in the book so far?

06:53.160 --> 06:57.160
Um, how about the conflict
between Mark's parents?

06:59.120 --> 07:01.330
His mother thinks that

07:01.330 --> 07:04.590
an education is Mark's ticket
to a better life,

07:04.590 --> 07:06.500
while his father feels that
an education is worthless

07:06.500 --> 07:08.420
for a black man
during Apartheid.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.470
Any thoughts on that?

07:15.100 --> 07:17.680
And of course,
the school is evaluating me

07:17.680 --> 07:19.140
on my track three class.

07:19.140 --> 07:20.060
What's a track three class?

07:20.060 --> 07:22.770
Where they stick
the low‐income and POC kids.

07:22.770 --> 07:24.690
It's based off of academic
performance and ability.

07:24.690 --> 07:27.320
Tracking kids
doesn't improve learning,

07:27.320 --> 07:28.820
it only increase inequity.

07:28.820 --> 07:30.450
And technically
it's unconstitutional.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.200
Okay, look, they gave me
five weeks of teacher training

07:33.200 --> 07:34.530
before I went
into a classroom.

07:34.530 --> 07:36.160
I am trying my hardest,

07:36.160 --> 07:38.950
but unlike my honor students,
who show up every day,

07:38.950 --> 07:41.160
eager to learn,
my track three class

07:41.160 --> 07:42.670
just doesn't do
their homework

07:42.670 --> 07:43.750
and they don't
pay attention.

07:44.290 --> 07:46.460
I try, but it's like
they just don't care.

07:47.130 --> 07:48.250
I mean,
if you're treated

07:48.250 --> 07:50.220
as intellectually less than
from day one,

07:50.220 --> 07:52.430
why would you
believe in yourself?
Or bother trying?

07:52.430 --> 07:54.260
Mariana: Even at MIT,

07:54.260 --> 07:55.390
some of my teachers
definitely assumed

07:55.390 --> 07:57.260
that the white women
in my classes
were smarter than me.

07:57.260 --> 07:58.810
‐Always.
‐Davia: Well,

07:58.810 --> 08:00.480
I don't underestimate
my kids.

08:01.060 --> 08:02.310
I even took your advice
and found a book

08:02.310 --> 08:03.850
that they could relate to.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.400
(students laughing)

08:05.400 --> 08:07.440
I think the real conflict
with this book

08:08.190 --> 08:10.030
is that no one wants
to read it.

08:11.490 --> 08:13.410
What <i>Kaffir Boy</i> needs

08:14.070 --> 08:15.740

a temporary situation.

09:14.340 --> 09:16.840
you put your boyfriend
in charge of your app?

09:18.180 --> 09:20.140
Well, because he was
on the team before Claire.

09:41.530 --> 09:43.080
Would you trust
the launch of your app

09:43.080 --> 09:44.660
to someone you were
giving a chance to

09:44.660 --> 09:46.660
or give it to someone
you knew could deliver?

09:48.960 --> 09:50.170
I don't know.

But I'm not so sure

09:51.380 --> 09:54.090
alienating the only allies you
have in here is a wise move.

09:58.380 --> 09:59.260
(sighs)

10:02.010 --> 10:03.720
(indistinct conversation)

10:09.310 --> 10:10.310
Good morning.

10:11.060 --> 10:12.190
Good morning, Mariana.

10:18.030 --> 10:19.490
Chisa:
Uh! Uh! Uhh!

10:19.490 --> 10:20.570
Ohh!

10:20.570 --> 10:21.700
Bye.

10:21.700 --> 10:23.280
(laughing)

10:23.280 --> 10:24.120
There it is.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.160
Good job today!

10:29.960 --> 10:31.080
So, my kids hate me.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.250
No, they don't.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.170
Yeah?
Well, they certainly
don't respect me.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.010
I thought they'd be
into this new book,

10:37.010 --> 10:39.470
but they're just
as disengaged as ever.

10:40.260 --> 10:41.470
How do you do it?

10:41.470 --> 10:42.510
You just started doing this.

10:42.510 --> 10:43.680
Give it a couple years.

10:43.680 --> 10:45.220
I might not have
that option.

10:45.220 --> 10:46.640
Look, sometimes
you gotta get creative.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.100
I have kids who couldn't
care less about math,
but love football.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.060
So we talk yards per carry,
passer ratings,

10:53.060 --> 10:54.980
why Tom Brady's
the best QB in the game‐‐

10:55.360 --> 10:56.280
You mean
Aaron Rodgers.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.240
And suddenly they're doing
statistics and probability.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.200
Feel free to run
any ideas by me.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.540
I will.
Thank you.

11:20.220 --> 11:20.970
Uh... you Callie?

11:22.050 --> 11:23.220
‐Graham?
‐Yeah.

11:23.220 --> 11:24.140
Sorry I'm late.

11:24.140 --> 11:25.510
Do you mind if I get
a coffee real quick?

11:28.220 --> 11:29.270
Sure.

11:29.270 --> 11:30.230
Okay.

11:31.810 --> 11:33.060
Joseph:
<i>Up to a year in jail?</i>

11:33.060 --> 11:35.110
Malika: That's kind of
the worst‐case scenario.

11:35.110 --> 11:37.780
But Judge Wilson does have
a big influence,

11:37.780 --> 11:40.360
so... I'm sure he could make
the worst case happen

11:40.360 --> 11:41.490
if he wants to.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.070
Can your friend...

11:43.950 --> 11:45.160
‐Callie.
‐Can she talk to him?

11:45.160 --> 11:46.410
She already tried.

11:46.410 --> 11:48.450
It's just so hard
to be sidelined.

11:48.450 --> 11:51.460
I feel like the work is
what gave my life purpose.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.210
Your life can't just be
about the fight.

11:53.210 --> 11:54.380
I know. I know.
I know.

12:02.510 --> 12:04.640
I told you I didn't regret
the sacrifices I made

12:04.640 --> 12:06.220
for the movement, but...

12:07.310 --> 12:08.890
I was lying
to myself.

12:10.060 --> 12:11.180
Look at you and Dom,

12:12.390 --> 12:14.560
and all the years
I missed out
on being your dad.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.690
Your mama told me,

12:16.690 --> 12:18.480
I was out there fighting
against the destruction

12:18.480 --> 12:20.070
of black families
and couldn't see...

12:21.150 --> 12:22.200
I was destroying
my own.

12:24.110 --> 12:24.990
Your mother...

12:26.700 --> 12:27.830
I loved her.

12:29.580 --> 12:31.200
She made me
a better man,

12:31.200 --> 12:32.370
a better activist.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.370
My family...

12:36.080 --> 12:37.130
you were my peace...

12:38.460 --> 12:39.960
and you should have been
my main purpose.

12:46.050 --> 12:47.680
So what's happening
with your young man?

12:48.260 --> 12:49.970
(chuckles)
Uh...

12:52.180 --> 12:53.350
I messed that up.

12:54.480 --> 12:55.730
I let him down.

12:56.190 --> 12:58.150
So... fix it.

12:59.270 --> 13:01.320
Just show up for him
the way he shows up for you.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.110
(distant siren wailing)

13:06.530 --> 13:08.160
I just can't believe
he's gone, you know.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.950
When was the last time
you saw him?

13:12.200 --> 13:13.410
It's been a while.

13:13.410 --> 13:14.620
I've been trying
not to party.

13:14.620 --> 13:16.670
Just... stay focused
on school.

13:17.830 --> 13:20.090
And did you know that Tate
was working on his sobriety?

13:20.750 --> 13:22.260
‐Yeah.
‐But he was still partying?

13:22.260 --> 13:24.260
Yeah. And I called him out
on it, and he just got
pissed at me.

13:24.260 --> 13:25.800
So you have no idea

13:25.800 --> 13:27.090
who gave him the drugs
that killed him?

13:27.800 --> 13:28.850
No.

13:29.720 --> 13:30.760
No clue.

13:33.470 --> 13:35.890
So, you were
a friend of Tate's?

13:36.730 --> 13:37.600
Not really.

13:38.810 --> 13:41.940
His father asked me
to talk to some of his friends.

13:43.070 --> 13:44.820
He just wants to know more
about his son and what happened.

13:44.820 --> 13:47.360
‐Why?
‐Don't you think he deserves
to know how his son died?

13:49.120 --> 13:51.080
Nothing he finds out
is gonna bring Tate back.

13:51.530 --> 13:52.540
I gotta go.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.500
(cell phone buzzes)

14:03.300 --> 14:04.510
Raj:
You're doing it again.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.880
‐Mariana: What?
‐Raj: Micro‐managing.

14:06.380 --> 14:08.220
They know you're texting me
every five seconds,

14:08.220 --> 14:09.470
and I feel like an idiot.

14:09.930 --> 14:12.010
Alex and Sam are right,
I have no balls.

14:12.470 --> 14:14.640
Why are balls always
the measure of a man's strength

14:14.640 --> 14:16.680
when we know it's
the weakest part your body?

14:16.680 --> 14:18.770
Also, the ugliest.
No offense.

14:19.060 --> 14:19.980
None taken.

14:21.190 --> 14:22.400
Look, I want
to support you.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.190
But this is
very unprofessional.

14:24.190 --> 14:25.990
Fair or not, you got
taken off your app,

14:25.990 --> 14:27.240
and you've just
gotta suck it up

14:27.240 --> 14:28.570
and let people
do their jobs.

14:28.570 --> 14:30.490
Including me.
And by the way,

14:30.490 --> 14:32.120
everyone knows that
we meet in here.

14:32.120 --> 14:33.370
So, time to find
a new place.

14:44.590 --> 14:45.760
How was your day?

14:47.380 --> 14:48.590
Shitty.

14:49.470 --> 14:50.640
Yours?

14:52.140 --> 14:53.220
Same old, same old.

14:53.930 --> 14:55.600
Except you haven't had
a hangover in a while?

14:55.600 --> 14:57.680
(chopping loudly)

14:57.680 --> 14:59.350
‐Hey.
‐Hey.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.040
(moaning softly)

15:21.250 --> 15:22.210
Okay.

15:23.210 --> 15:24.590
Take it easy
with that knife.

15:36.760 --> 15:39.020
♪♪

15:42.150 --> 15:43.270
Do you have a minute?

15:51.570 --> 15:53.160
You can't be drinking
with Dennis.

15:53.490 --> 15:54.530
Why?

15:55.240 --> 15:56.080
Because he's...

15:56.830 --> 15:57.830
just...

15:59.080 --> 16:01.410
really fragile and‐‐

16:01.410 --> 16:03.330
‐You just can't.
‐(chuckles) Okay.

16:03.330 --> 16:06.170
Dennis is a grown‐ass man.
He can do what he wants.

16:08.670 --> 16:11.090
Dennis was just released
from a psychiatric hospital

16:11.090 --> 16:13.050
because his son died
two years ago.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.390
And his divorce
was just finalized.

16:25.560 --> 16:27.440
‐I didn't know.
‐No one does.

16:28.610 --> 16:30.900
That's why he hasn't been
hanging out much lately.

16:30.900 --> 16:33.070
He's depressed
and spiraling.

16:33.070 --> 16:34.780
And adding alcohol to that
isn't gonna help.

16:35.240 --> 16:36.740
Okay. I'm sorry.

16:38.030 --> 16:40.160
Yeah. He also uses sex
to numb the pain, so...

16:41.700 --> 16:43.120
We didn't have sex, Davia.

16:48.460 --> 16:50.800
No, I... I know that.
I was just...

16:50.800 --> 16:52.550
speaking in general.

16:55.090 --> 16:57.350
You have to promise
to keep this between us?

16:58.680 --> 16:59.810
Yeah. I‐I got you.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.020
Okay.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.060
(door opens)

17:06.099 --> 17:07.230
(door closes)

17:08.150 --> 17:09.770
(people chattering)

17:09.770 --> 17:11.280
Man: Sounds like
a good deal to me.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.150
Guys, it's just
a temporary phase.

17:13.150 --> 17:14.069
You can't take
those payments.

17:14.069 --> 17:15.819
Man:
We don't wanna move out,

17:16.660 --> 17:18.119
but they're giving us
a lot of money.

17:18.869 --> 17:21.369
‐We got kids and bills to pay.
‐But they're low‐balling you.

17:21.369 --> 17:23.750
What they're offering
is less than what you deserve.

17:23.750 --> 17:25.540
It's still something.
What if we lose the lawsuit?

17:25.540 --> 17:27.119
Then we get evicted
with nothing.

17:27.119 --> 17:28.079
At least if we take
the vouchers,

17:28.079 --> 17:29.880
it can help us move
into a new place.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.250
I know it sounds like
a lot of money, guys.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.050
But think about
the moving expenses,

17:33.050 --> 17:34.800
security deposits,
utilities,

17:34.800 --> 17:36.430
and the higher rents
you're gonna have to pay.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.180
And we gonna have to put
our kids in new schools

17:38.180 --> 17:40.850
so they can build
their luxury apartments
and shopping malls?

17:40.850 --> 17:43.020
Shopping malls create jobs.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.140
Minimum wage jobs

17:45.180 --> 17:47.770
that you'll end up having
to travel miles to get to,

17:47.770 --> 17:50.730
'cause you can't afford
to live near where you work.

17:50.730 --> 17:52.320
You'll be priced
out of the neighborhoods

17:52.320 --> 17:53.780
that you made thrive.

17:53.780 --> 17:56.070
Neighborhoods that they
didn't want to live in

17:56.070 --> 17:57.780
until you made them beautiful.

17:57.780 --> 18:00.200
And now that the economy
is booming for the one percent,

18:00.200 --> 18:02.790
they want to take your homes
and push you out.

18:03.410 --> 18:05.080
Look, I'm not telling you
anything you don't already know.

18:05.660 --> 18:08.580
And we can't write you a check,
but we can fight for you.

18:09.290 --> 18:11.750
But our power lies in numbers.

18:11.750 --> 18:14.380
We need more than a few of you.
We need all of you.

18:17.220 --> 18:19.590
(tenants chattering)

18:22.640 --> 18:24.220
Mariana:
Thank you guys
for coming.

18:24.220 --> 18:25.060
Gina: Yeah.
It better be worth it.

18:25.060 --> 18:26.270
I had to bail on a date

18:26.270 --> 18:28.230
with the cutest
Pikachu cosplayer in L. A.

18:28.230 --> 18:30.560
(coughs) Sounds like
Mariana did you a favor.

18:30.560 --> 18:33.110
So, why are we even having
these meetings anymore?

18:34.860 --> 18:35.780
Because I screwed up.

18:37.490 --> 18:40.280
I shouldn't have made Raj
the interim Green Team leader.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.330
The point is, you chose
to put a man in charge.

18:42.330 --> 18:43.700
He's not a man,
he's my boyfriend.

18:44.830 --> 18:46.500
I mean,
of‐of course he's a man.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.960
He's not a douchebag.

18:49.250 --> 18:52.000
And I chose him because
I couldn't give up control.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.880
But the message
that sent

18:53.880 --> 18:55.630
is that even we trust men

18:55.630 --> 18:57.050
over women
as team leaders.

18:57.050 --> 18:59.090
I know, and that's why
I'm apologizing.

18:59.090 --> 19:02.350
But I worked my ass off
to create that app,

19:02.970 --> 19:04.560
and I just‐‐ I felt like

19:04.560 --> 19:06.850
Claire took over
without any consideration

19:06.850 --> 19:08.680
‐to my ownership‐‐
‐Someone had to step up.

19:08.680 --> 19:11.150
Yeah, but my loss shouldn't be
seized upon as your gain.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.650
Not when the whole point of this
is to have each other's backs.

19:13.650 --> 19:16.280
All I wanted was
an opportunity to prove myself

19:16.280 --> 19:18.490
because who knows if
I'll ever get another chance

19:18.490 --> 19:19.820
to be a team leader.

19:19.820 --> 19:21.740
Casey:
But if we operate
as if there's only

19:21.740 --> 19:23.870
one seat at the table
for women,

19:23.870 --> 19:25.830
then we're just gonna
end up competing

19:25.830 --> 19:27.240
rather than collaborating
with each other.

19:27.240 --> 19:29.210
Rachel: We all deserve
a seat at the table.

19:29.660 --> 19:31.170
Maybe they can deny
one woman,

19:31.170 --> 19:32.880
but they can't deny
all of us.

19:33.250 --> 19:34.590
If we stick together.

19:38.210 --> 19:39.220
I'm sorry.

19:39.840 --> 19:41.010
I didn't mean
to make you feel like

19:41.010 --> 19:42.180
I was taking over
your app.

19:42.970 --> 19:44.640
And I'm sorry
that I didn't trust

19:44.640 --> 19:46.010
that you could
pull off the launch.

19:47.430 --> 19:48.810
I want you to be
Team Leader.

19:49.810 --> 19:51.100
And I promise

19:51.100 --> 19:53.100
I will try my best
to only text you

19:53.100 --> 19:54.520
20 or 30 times a day.

19:55.060 --> 19:56.400
(laughs)
Only?

19:57.230 --> 19:58.860
Okay. Good.
I'll just turn
my ringer off, then.

19:58.860 --> 20:00.030
(indistinct chatter)

20:00.570 --> 20:01.700
‐Appreciate it.
‐Yeah.

20:03.360 --> 20:04.780
We got three tenants
to reconsider

20:04.780 --> 20:05.780
and two more signed on.

20:05.780 --> 20:07.080
So, we're at
15 plaintiffs.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.330
Oh, looks like
we're back in business.

20:08.330 --> 20:09.290
Yeah.

20:10.000 --> 20:10.960
Hey.

20:11.500 --> 20:12.710
Nice speech tonight.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.790
It was, uh, heartfelt
and persuasive.

20:17.130 --> 20:19.000
You better be careful, Marcus,
or I might steal her away.

20:20.090 --> 20:22.010
‐Talk soon.
‐Yeah.

20:24.680 --> 20:25.930
Where did you
run off to earlier?

20:27.050 --> 20:27.930
I had a personal matter.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.850
This case is important.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.100
If we lose...

20:32.100 --> 20:34.190
many of those clients
could wind up homeless.

20:34.650 --> 20:35.600
Pretty speeches are great.

20:36.230 --> 20:37.980
But I need to know
I can count on you.

20:38.940 --> 20:39.860
You can.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.400
Absolutely.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.490
Teresa:
Are my files ready?

20:58.250 --> 20:59.170
Is that all?

21:04.050 --> 21:05.130
Mariana:
<i>So I heard you before,</i>

21:05.720 --> 21:06.970
and you're right.

21:06.970 --> 21:08.390
I'm going to let go
and I'm gonna make Claire

21:08.390 --> 21:09.390
the team leader.

21:09.390 --> 21:10.510
Which means

21:10.510 --> 21:12.220
we can suffer together again
on the Blue Team,

21:12.220 --> 21:13.350
just like old times.

21:13.810 --> 21:16.690
But now we can take "breaks"
in the supply closet.

21:18.270 --> 21:19.020
No.

21:20.150 --> 21:22.570
Well, the roof is,
like, pretty exposed.

21:22.570 --> 21:23.650
No!

21:24.200 --> 21:26.240
I mean, you're not
firing me off your app

21:26.240 --> 21:27.820
for the second time!

21:27.820 --> 21:28.990
I'm not having
everyone thinking

21:28.990 --> 21:31.370
once again that
I couldn't cut it.

21:31.870 --> 21:33.330
I'm fine working
under Claire,

21:33.330 --> 21:35.160
but I am staying
on the app.

21:38.790 --> 21:39.750
That's so hot.

21:41.460 --> 21:42.710
(clattering)

21:42.710 --> 21:44.260
Is your back okay?

21:46.880 --> 21:48.390
(school bell rings)

21:54.890 --> 21:56.890
("Wild Mann"
by Cy Dune playing)

22:04.610 --> 22:05.740
Good afternoon.

22:13.910 --> 22:15.040
(exhales deeply)

22:43.480 --> 22:44.650
What the hell was that?

22:49.070 --> 22:51.780
So, that was a dance
created by miners

22:51.780 --> 22:54.120
who were forced to work
in brutal conditions

22:54.120 --> 22:56.040
during Apartheid
in South Africa.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.450
Minors like kids?

22:57.450 --> 23:00.330
No. Miners like,
men who worked in mines.

23:00.330 --> 23:01.170
Mining gold.

23:01.580 --> 23:04.000
These miners were separated
from their families,

23:04.000 --> 23:05.300
forced to work
in the dark,

23:05.300 --> 23:07.720
chained to their stations,
and weren't allowed to speak,

23:07.720 --> 23:09.050
so they came up
with this dance

23:09.050 --> 23:10.220
as a way to communicate
with each other.

23:11.010 --> 23:12.850
‐That's dope.
‐Yeah.

23:13.390 --> 23:15.100
I thought by learning
about this dance,

23:15.100 --> 23:17.060
we could learn about
what was going on

23:17.060 --> 23:18.600
during the time
of <i>Kaffir Boy.</i>

23:22.730 --> 23:24.610
These miners came up
with this dance

23:24.610 --> 23:25.730
in the face
of oppression.

23:26.320 --> 23:28.860
As a form of protest
and expression.

23:28.860 --> 23:30.990
Not unlike rap
and hip‐hop

23:30.990 --> 23:32.910
and other artistic
forms of protest

23:32.910 --> 23:34.120
in our country today.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.660
‐And this is where
stepping came from.
‐(students laugh)

23:36.660 --> 23:39.580
(chattering)

23:40.160 --> 23:41.080
Let's see it again.

23:41.790 --> 23:43.750
(stomping boots)

23:43.750 --> 23:44.670
(tapping)

23:46.250 --> 23:47.630
(students clapping)

24:29.090 --> 24:29.960
It's not him.

24:38.220 --> 24:39.680
(buzzes)

25:04.580 --> 25:06.210
I'm sorry.
I know you're mad at me.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
I'm not mad at you.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.010
You're not?

25:11.010 --> 25:11.920
No.

25:11.920 --> 25:13.050
But I exposed
the pay gap

25:13.050 --> 25:15.220
and I told you
to reach out to Amanda.

25:15.220 --> 25:16.430
I'm the reason that
they brought Kendra in.

25:16.430 --> 25:18.050
No. It's my fault.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.060
It's my company,
and I knew there were issues

25:21.060 --> 25:23.020
and I didn't do
anything about them.

25:23.850 --> 25:25.640
I'm not even mad
at Amanda.

25:26.690 --> 25:29.400
Though I don't think I'll be
asking her for a second date.

25:32.360 --> 25:33.570
That was a joke.

25:35.780 --> 25:37.200
‐Good one.
‐Hmm.

25:37.200 --> 25:38.820
See, you do have
a sense of humor.

25:38.820 --> 25:39.700
Thank you.

25:41.120 --> 25:43.290
Oh, but if you're not mad
at me, then why were you‐‐

25:43.290 --> 25:44.160
Pretending to be?

25:46.000 --> 25:47.040
I have a plan,

25:47.040 --> 25:48.540
to take back control
of the company.

25:48.540 --> 25:50.540
But I have to make
the board believe

25:50.540 --> 25:51.630
that I'm on their side,

25:51.630 --> 25:53.710
complying with all
of the changes

25:53.710 --> 25:54.630
that they want to make.

25:54.630 --> 25:56.050
Like closing
the pay gap?

25:56.050 --> 25:58.010
I mean, are they serious
about that?

25:58.010 --> 25:59.930
Only if they can slash jobs
to pay for it.

25:59.930 --> 26:01.510
But I don't want
to do that.

26:01.510 --> 26:02.850
And I won't have to

26:03.680 --> 26:04.850
if they lose faith
in Kendra.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.020
Then once she's out,
I can get rid of the board

26:08.020 --> 26:09.150
and start over,
you know.

26:09.150 --> 26:11.900
Do everything we want
to do to fix things here.

26:12.860 --> 26:14.150
Okay, but how
do we do that?

26:15.990 --> 26:17.320
I need your app
to fail.

26:20.910 --> 26:21.870
My app?

26:23.200 --> 26:26.210
Kendra has convinced the board
that the ACT‐ivism app

26:26.210 --> 26:28.210
will solve
our PR problems.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.170
If it fails, she fails.

26:32.210 --> 26:33.460
I get the company back.

26:36.220 --> 26:37.510
Can I think about it?

26:39.800 --> 26:41.470
Of course, yes.

26:56.570 --> 26:57.900
Do you know
who that is?

27:00.160 --> 27:02.700
If this kid is selling pills
pressed with fentanyl,

27:02.700 --> 27:03.910
other people are gonna die.

27:03.910 --> 27:05.580
You want that
on your conscience?

27:08.040 --> 27:10.960
Uh... h‐his name is Chase.
He was in rehab with Tate.

27:11.670 --> 27:13.040
I‐I only met him once.

27:14.210 --> 27:16.300
‐What's his last name?
‐Uh, I don't know.

27:18.630 --> 27:20.300
But I could probably
find out for you.

27:20.840 --> 27:21.800
‐(knock at door)
‐Allison: Dad.

27:23.220 --> 27:25.100
Um, the Pearsons
are leaving.

27:25.100 --> 27:26.520
They wanted
to say goodbye.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.560
I'll be right down.

27:33.190 --> 27:34.900
(cell phone buzzes)

27:41.740 --> 27:42.610
<i>Okay.</i>

27:43.450 --> 27:44.990
Yeah, I'll be in the office
this afternoon.

27:48.120 --> 27:49.080
Hey.

27:49.620 --> 27:51.160
‐Who was that?
‐Marcus.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.000
‐Everything okay?
‐No.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.250
Apparently,
the development company
we're trying to sue

27:56.250 --> 27:58.210
is owned by
a Chinese company

27:58.210 --> 27:59.550
which jeopardizes
our case‐‐

27:59.550 --> 28:01.090
Because to be sued
in California,

28:01.090 --> 28:04.220
the California court has
to have adequate jurisdiction.

28:04.220 --> 28:05.350
The whole class action
could be dead in the water.

28:06.180 --> 28:07.970
Not if they have deep enough
contacts here to pursue.

28:10.350 --> 28:11.560
I can do some digging.

28:12.100 --> 28:13.060
What's the name
of the company?

28:13.730 --> 28:14.690
Anwei International?

28:18.150 --> 28:19.030
I'll be right back.

28:19.570 --> 28:21.780
Your honor,
where are you going?

28:21.780 --> 28:22.990
I know
where he lives.

28:22.990 --> 28:24.110
Who?

28:24.110 --> 28:25.660
The dealer
who killed my son.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.040
‐I'm coming with you.
‐(engine starts)

28:37.090 --> 28:39.800
(engine revving)

28:42.170 --> 28:43.970
(students chattering)

29:03.530 --> 29:04.910
What up,
Gumboot Becky!

29:24.050 --> 29:25.050
You wanna get drunk?

29:27.760 --> 29:29.470
Uh, I‐I can't.

29:29.470 --> 29:30.470
I have plans.

29:30.890 --> 29:31.890
Well...

29:33.350 --> 29:34.390
Another time.

29:36.310 --> 29:37.150
Dennis?

29:41.020 --> 29:42.320
You shouldn't drink alone.

29:56.370 --> 29:57.790
(banging on door)

29:58.330 --> 30:00.040
(cell phone buzzes)

30:02.050 --> 30:04.090
(dogs barking in distance)

30:04.090 --> 30:05.010
(banging continues)

30:06.050 --> 30:07.340
I don't think
he's here.

30:07.340 --> 30:09.300
We should take
his name to the police,

30:09.300 --> 30:10.180
let them handle it‐‐

30:10.180 --> 30:11.390
They're not gonna
do anything.

30:11.390 --> 30:13.140
You think they care about
rich kids who OD on drugs?

30:13.810 --> 30:15.140
Hey, Chase!
Chase Carter!

30:15.140 --> 30:16.060
Okay, but what're
you gonna do?

30:16.890 --> 30:19.310
'Cause right now you're angry.
And with good reason.

30:19.310 --> 30:22.150
But yelling at this kid is
not going to bring Tate back.

30:22.150 --> 30:24.360
And it's not going
to make anything better.

30:28.280 --> 30:29.110
Chase?

30:30.240 --> 30:31.280
You Chase?

30:31.280 --> 30:32.330
Hey, what's going on?

30:32.330 --> 30:33.830
‐Oh, whoa, whoa!
‐You killed my son!

30:34.750 --> 30:36.660
‐I don't know what
you're talking about!
‐Tate Wilson.

30:37.250 --> 30:38.580
You gave him some pills
laced with fentanyl.

30:38.580 --> 30:40.040
‐I didn't give him anything.
‐Sir.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.290
Bullshit!
I know it was you.

30:41.290 --> 30:43.460
No, it wasn't me.
He bought that stuff online.

30:43.460 --> 30:45.010
I‐I swear.
I swear to God.

30:45.010 --> 30:46.800
I told him not to trust it,
but he'd already taken it

30:46.800 --> 30:47.760
when I got there.

30:47.760 --> 30:48.930
You left him?

30:49.890 --> 30:51.550
You knew he'd taken something
and you didn't stay.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.180
‐Your Honor.
‐You didn't wait around

30:53.180 --> 30:54.100
to see if he'd
stopped breathing

30:54.100 --> 30:55.640
or called somebody
for help?

30:56.310 --> 30:57.560
You might as well
have killed him!

30:57.560 --> 30:58.940
You Honor,
please get off‐‐

31:02.230 --> 31:03.020
I'm sorry.

31:04.110 --> 31:05.030
I'm sorry.

31:05.650 --> 31:06.610
I'm so sorry.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.070
I'm so sorry.

31:10.410 --> 31:11.570
Go.

31:19.870 --> 31:21.370
I failed him.
I failed my son.

31:28.630 --> 31:31.550
(inaudible)

31:34.050 --> 31:35.310
It's my fault.

31:38.180 --> 31:39.100
I made him hate me.

31:41.190 --> 31:42.560
(crying)
He's gone.

31:49.110 --> 31:53.280
(inaudible)

31:53.280 --> 31:55.240
(continues crying)

32:19.310 --> 32:20.270
Hi.

32:20.930 --> 32:21.770
Hey.

32:22.350 --> 32:23.980
‐(door closes)
‐So, uh, what's up?

32:25.230 --> 32:26.110
Come with me.

32:27.190 --> 32:29.480
(people chattering)

32:31.070 --> 32:32.570
‐Man: Hey!
‐Woman: Hey!

32:32.570 --> 32:34.700
Man 2:
Hey! What's up, big dog?

32:34.700 --> 32:36.700
(laughter and chatter)

32:39.410 --> 32:40.410
What's going on?

32:41.250 --> 32:43.080
I invited your family
over for dinner

32:43.080 --> 32:45.750
hoping that they would
give me another chance.

32:45.750 --> 32:46.880
And...

32:47.540 --> 32:49.210
hoping that you will too?

32:49.920 --> 32:51.050
Girl: Ooh!

32:51.050 --> 32:52.380
Joy: He better.

32:52.380 --> 32:54.260
or he's not getting any
of my mac and cheese.

32:54.260 --> 32:55.930
All: Oh!

32:57.720 --> 32:59.680
(happy chatter)

33:08.940 --> 33:11.820
He believed in Santa Claus
until he was 13.

33:11.820 --> 33:14.200
That's only because she was
sending Dad up to the roof

33:14.200 --> 33:15.570
to make reindeer noises.

33:15.570 --> 33:17.620
Uh... what are
reindeer noises?

33:17.620 --> 33:19.080
‐Hoof sounds.
‐Woman: Uh‐huh. Okay.

33:19.080 --> 33:22.370
It's true. We'd make,
uh, soot marks
by the fireplace.

33:22.370 --> 33:24.210
‐That's sweet.
‐Caleb: And he believed

33:24.210 --> 33:25.960
in the tooth fairy for like
a hella long time.

33:28.290 --> 33:30.380
Y'all better relax because I
have stories about y'all too.

33:30.380 --> 33:31.210
‐Oh!
‐What you got?

33:31.210 --> 33:32.170
After all this,

33:32.170 --> 33:33.380
I need more wine.

33:33.380 --> 33:35.090
(overlapping chatter)

33:37.800 --> 33:40.350
(laughter)

33:42.810 --> 33:45.100
So, sis, what's, uh, happening
with this arrest?

33:46.810 --> 33:48.060
I don't really know yet.

33:48.060 --> 33:50.070
I read about violating
restraining orders.

33:50.070 --> 33:51.150
Is it true you might

33:51.150 --> 33:52.780
have to do
some jail time?

33:52.780 --> 33:54.990
‐It's a possibility.
‐Jail time? What you mean?

33:54.990 --> 33:56.200
You didn't say nothin'
about that.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.490
Right, 'cause
we're not doing that

33:57.490 --> 33:58.450
right now.

33:59.530 --> 34:01.120
(overlapping chatter)

34:01.120 --> 34:03.200
Not today, guys.
Not today!

34:03.200 --> 34:04.700
Today we're living
in the moment.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.130
It is what it is.

34:09.130 --> 34:11.710
Ooh, yes!
This is my song!

34:11.710 --> 34:14.210
Let's get up on our feet
and dance, y'all.

34:14.210 --> 34:16.010
Oh yeah! Everybody.

34:16.010 --> 34:17.969
("Truth Tea" playing
over speakers)

34:18.469 --> 34:19.969
Whoo!

34:20.850 --> 34:23.429
I just hope our dad
isn't filling her head
with more ideas.

34:23.429 --> 34:25.179
Just because
he's been to prison

34:25.179 --> 34:26.270
and he's proud of it.

34:26.730 --> 34:28.440
Look, Dom, I know it's none
of my business, but...

34:29.770 --> 34:30.770
I don't think
he's about that.

34:30.770 --> 34:32.020
(song continues)

34:32.730 --> 34:33.650
Come on.

34:33.650 --> 34:35.110
<i>♪ Sip on this truth tea ♪</i>

34:35.110 --> 34:37.280
<i>♪ You say you're sorry ♪</i>

34:37.280 --> 34:39.860
<i>♪ But I'm better without ♪</i>

34:43.080 --> 34:44.080
You wanted
to see me?

34:56.010 --> 34:57.670
Did you tell Malika
about Jacob?

35:07.060 --> 35:09.270
Dennis: You gave me your word
that you wouldn't tell anyone.

35:09.270 --> 35:11.440
But I‐I don't know why
I would believe you.

35:11.440 --> 35:12.860
Y‐y‐you lie
about everything.

35:12.860 --> 35:14.400
I should never
have trusted you.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.610
What are you talking about?
When have I ever lied to you?

35:16.610 --> 35:17.530
Jeff?

35:19.070 --> 35:21.070
I know you didn't
break up with him
and you told me you did.

35:21.070 --> 35:22.280
Okay, so what?

35:22.280 --> 35:23.370
Why do you care so much

35:23.370 --> 35:24.780
about when I broke up
with him?

35:26.160 --> 35:27.790
I don't.
I‐I, uh...

35:27.790 --> 35:29.540
‐I don't care.
‐You know, talk about lying,

35:29.540 --> 35:31.250
your whole life is a lie!

35:31.830 --> 35:34.090
You lie to everyone
who cares about you

35:34.090 --> 35:35.630
by hiding in your pain.

35:36.500 --> 35:38.470
Making everyone believe that
you're just some sort of loser

35:38.470 --> 35:40.220
who dropped out of life
for no reason.

35:40.220 --> 35:41.510
Just leave me alone.

35:43.140 --> 35:43.970
‐No.
‐Just...

35:44.800 --> 35:46.640
‐...leave me alone!
‐No!

35:47.640 --> 35:49.270
‐I want to be alone!
‐No.

35:49.270 --> 35:51.140
‐I want to be alone!
‐Bullshit!

35:54.270 --> 35:56.690
If you wanted to be alone,
you wouldn't have moved
into the Coterie.

35:58.780 --> 36:00.400
You need people.

36:02.990 --> 36:04.910
What if you try
to hurt yourself?

36:05.870 --> 36:07.660
What if you succeed?

36:07.660 --> 36:10.960
I can't keep enabling you
by keeping your secret.

36:11.790 --> 36:13.710
Making excuses
to everyone

36:13.710 --> 36:16.460
while you just isolate
yourself in here,

36:16.460 --> 36:18.630
doing whatever you're hiding
behind that.

36:19.550 --> 36:20.760
What are you hiding?

36:21.880 --> 36:23.130
No! Don't!

36:42.240 --> 36:44.030
(sobbing)

36:44.990 --> 36:47.490
How can you keep
all of this pain inside?

36:50.910 --> 36:52.210
You need help.

36:55.790 --> 36:57.920
If you really want
to honor Jacob's memory,

36:59.050 --> 37:00.630
honor your own life.

37:27.660 --> 37:29.080
Wilson: I'm sorry

37:29.080 --> 37:30.830
about what I did today.

37:31.750 --> 37:35.210
Well, what you did
out of grief and anger

37:35.210 --> 37:37.420
and wanting someone
to be held accountable

37:37.420 --> 37:39.670
for your loss
is understandable.

37:42.550 --> 37:44.470
That's what Malika
was doing when she came

37:44.470 --> 37:45.430
into your chambers.

37:47.050 --> 37:49.510
It's what Jamal's mother
wants for her son.

37:50.310 --> 37:52.060
And it's why
Black Lives Matter

37:52.060 --> 37:53.890
is protesting
your appointment.

37:58.230 --> 38:00.230
And I suppose
you concur.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.530
The conservative courts
in this country have become

38:05.530 --> 38:06.740
completely partisan.

38:08.070 --> 38:10.120
They unapologetically protect

38:10.120 --> 38:12.240
the agenda
of the powerful

38:12.240 --> 38:14.620
and the privileged
and the religious right.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.960
They want to overturn
Roe v. Wade.

38:16.960 --> 38:20.080
Ignoring the wishes of
the majority of people who...

38:21.630 --> 38:23.960
support a woman's
right to choose.

38:24.460 --> 38:26.340
So, if you're not going
to respect settled law

38:26.670 --> 38:28.340
and equal protection
for all,

38:28.340 --> 38:29.590
then, yes...

38:31.140 --> 38:32.140
I concur.

38:35.310 --> 38:37.140
I'm sorry,
now is not the time.

38:39.270 --> 38:40.730
I appreciate
your candor.

38:42.690 --> 38:44.030
The last thing I'll say:

38:44.820 --> 38:47.070
<i>I swear on my life</i>

38:47.860 --> 38:50.410
that Malika did not know
that they were protesting you.

38:51.410 --> 38:53.700
<i>And she didn't leave</i>
<i>because the people</i>

38:53.700 --> 38:56.080
who are fighting
for Black lives, for her life,

38:56.500 --> 38:57.910
<i>were counting on her.</i>

38:59.040 --> 39:01.880
And I think that's something
you can respect.

39:04.090 --> 39:05.880
Your tenacity...

39:06.460 --> 39:08.260
<i>will take you far,</i>

39:08.260 --> 39:09.930
<i>Callie Adams Foster.</i>

39:14.810 --> 39:17.430
I am truly sorry
for your loss, Your Honor.

Isaac: You really

39:35.910 --> 39:37.120
I appreciate that.

39:37.120 --> 39:39.160
Well, I wanted you to know
that the movement

39:39.160 --> 39:40.710
is not
my primary partner.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
You are.

39:46.300 --> 39:47.380
And...

39:49.260 --> 39:50.680
I want you to know...

39:53.180 --> 39:54.470

Are you sure
you're okay?

40:45.270 --> 40:46.270
I will be.

40:48.440 --> 40:49.440
How are you?
You okay?

40:50.280 --> 40:51.240
Yeah.

40:52.610 --> 40:53.610
Talk to me.

40:55.530 --> 40:58.200
Nah, just...
Later. At home.

40:58.200 --> 41:00.910
Mm. Just, now, please.

41:01.790 --> 41:04.000
I can't take
any more suspense.

41:09.210 --> 41:12.050
The company that owns
the development group
you're suing?

41:13.760 --> 41:15.090
Anwei International?

41:19.180 --> 41:20.140
