08:04.442 --> 08:06.694
Idalia, my little one.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.203
Aunt Biagia!

08:15.286 --> 08:17.914
Hello, my sweet Idalia.

08:19.582 --> 08:20.416
Where is Lino?

09:13.678 --> 09:16.973
Sit next to me. With the child.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.344
Idalia is tired.

09:55.428 --> 09:59.140
My mother
made you a room upstairs.

10:53.277 --> 10:56.822
I was ten years old
when my father died.

10:57.448 --> 11:01.077
And I was sad
because I couldn't see him anymore.

11:02.161 --> 11:06.916
But then I learned how
to use my imagination and my heart.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.668
My sweetheart.

11:08.751 --> 11:12.630
Even if your dad is no longer here,
I can see him.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.174
I can hear him. Here.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.844
And all that delicious food
he used to make for you?

11:18.928 --> 11:21.847
We can make it together. Me and you.

11:21.931 --> 11:27.812
And then when you're an old, old lady,
even older than me,

11:28.938 --> 11:30.981
you can teach your granddaughter.

11:31.732 --> 11:35.111
So that every time she is in her kitchen,

11:35.903 --> 11:39.824
she will see you, and she will see me,
and she will see Babbo.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.833
It's too much for her.

11:49.625 --> 11:52.044
My cousin Santina will watch the children.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.100
Where's Idalia?

12:06.183 --> 12:07.935
Inside, waiting for you!

13:57.586 --> 14:01.924
- Can I do anything to help?
-I work alone in my kitchen. Sit.

14:08.013 --> 14:08.973
The child?

14:09.765 --> 14:10.599
Asleep.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.628
I understand.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.881
After Giacomo died,

14:43.090 --> 14:45.259
I felt so tired,

14:45.342 --> 14:47.720
like my bones were made of stone.

14:47.803 --> 14:51.724
And I remember my mother was so tired
when my father died.

14:52.308 --> 14:56.103
I know this pain
because I have suffered it.

14:56.186 --> 15:00.190
And I know that you feel it double,
for you and your daughter.

15:03.193 --> 15:05.487
But you need to eat.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.556
Come here. Eat something.

15:35.392 --> 15:39.563
If you eat it all,
then you'll grow very big.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.127
The others want to know,
how come you don't wear black?

16:02.211 --> 16:05.422
Santina! You don't
have the manners God gave an ox.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.591
You don't
have to answer that.

16:07.675 --> 16:11.762
I told them of course
you wore black when Lino died.

16:12.680 --> 16:13.973
You did, right?

16:15.057 --> 16:17.726
Even for just for one day, right?

16:21.939 --> 16:23.732
When do you go back?

16:23.816 --> 16:27.027
You'll both stay
at least for the Feast of Sant'Anna, yes?

16:27.903 --> 16:29.238
We hadn't planned--

16:29.321 --> 16:34.743
Of course, the child is happy here
with family and fresh air.

16:35.327 --> 16:39.289
Lino always loved
the procession of Sant'Anna.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.049
I'm gonna take a walk.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.808
You always do this.

17:40.267 --> 17:43.145
Good evening, comrades.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.571
Signora, my condolences.

17:53.363 --> 17:58.786
Let me introduce myself.
I am Nunzio, the mayor of Castelleone.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.330
I knew your husband,

18:02.664 --> 18:05.000
God rest his soul.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.132
You may not know,

18:12.216 --> 18:17.554
but I have planned a helipad
and tennis courts for our small hamlet.

18:17.638 --> 18:22.101
Here we need innovation
and recreation, like America.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.563
Aren't there, like, 300 people in town?

18:26.647 --> 18:28.107
Five-hundred-thirteen.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.276
Two births last year. One this year.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.362
And only 15 deaths.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.659
Lovely meeting you.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.836
Mario! Look, look!

18:54.508 --> 18:57.678
She's pretty. Kinda dark. But pretty.

18:59.179 --> 19:01.598
She's leaving a bar,

19:01.682 --> 19:03.725
and her husband's in the cemetery.

19:04.434 --> 19:06.061
Poor Filomena.

21:23.865 --> 21:25.701
- Where have you been?
-What?

21:25.784 --> 21:27.202
Take a shower. Quick.

21:29.121 --> 21:32.708
These are the people
you have to visit while you're here.

21:32.791 --> 21:38.672
Names and houses,
and the order of who comes first.

21:39.214 --> 21:43.260
Filomena, I can't read this.

21:43.343 --> 21:44.219
Why not?

21:44.303 --> 21:48.348
No. I can't.
It's in Sicilian. What does this say?

21:49.433 --> 21:52.728
"Franco, the house next to the red door
with the flowers."

21:52.811 --> 21:56.898
"Tuccio, next to the bar
with all of the vans in the front."

21:56.982 --> 21:59.943
"Old Pina, near the cemetery."

22:00.819 --> 22:01.862
And the addresses?

22:01.945 --> 22:05.115
Who needs addresses?
I just told you where they are.

22:05.198 --> 22:06.908
You have to go today.

22:14.624 --> 22:18.962
Giacomo told me
that in America the bread is terrible.

22:20.130 --> 22:24.593
And there's so much fruit on trees
that it falls, and people step over it.

22:24.676 --> 22:27.179
No, thank you.

22:38.732 --> 22:41.151
She's not feeling well?
Come here, come here.

22:41.234 --> 22:44.112
She doesn't look well to me.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.405
No, my God.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.909
My God, she has to go to the doctor.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.912
No, that's not necessary.

22:51.995 --> 22:54.915
Come, come. She's sick.
She's sick, come on.

22:56.958 --> 23:00.128
The child is hurting.
We're going to the doctor's office.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.047
- No, she's fine.
-No, no, no.

23:02.130 --> 23:05.008
This isn't necessary, Santina.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.928
The doctor is the richest man in town,

23:08.011 --> 23:09.888
and no one has ever seen
the inside of his house.

23:09.971 --> 23:11.973
You can tell all of us what you see.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.726
I'm making sure
the child is okay.

23:14.810 --> 23:16.937
-Better safe than sorry!
- Shh!

23:17.020 --> 23:21.024
I heard there's a beautiful piano inside.

23:21.108 --> 23:24.694
And he drinks
from a teacup rimmed in real gold.

23:24.778 --> 23:27.322
The doctor will have
to invite you in for coffee.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.033
Because she's Lino's wife and American.

23:30.117 --> 23:33.662
And you too. This is our opportunity.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.580
Then you'll tell us everything you see.

23:36.081 --> 23:37.958
I'll wait for you.

23:44.673 --> 23:48.677
I would bet my widow's pension

23:48.760 --> 23:52.431
that Filomena and the American
will never make peace.

23:52.514 --> 23:56.393
No wife forgets that her husband's mother

23:56.476 --> 24:00.105
didn't come to her wedding.

24:12.659 --> 24:16.246
My wife made chamomile
for the child. She'll feel better.

24:21.501 --> 24:23.712
Yes, that is your father.

24:27.340 --> 24:29.968
I visited Florence once

24:30.844 --> 24:33.555
and dined where he worked.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.765
I never saw him so happy.

24:37.267 --> 24:39.436
And when I learned he was sick,

24:40.061 --> 24:41.897
I prayed for him often.

24:42.564 --> 24:43.648
He was one of ours.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.570
Lino was a special man.

24:49.529 --> 24:52.491
Warm and loving.

25:08.256 --> 25:09.883
And what happened?

25:11.510 --> 25:13.637
She's overcome
by the beauty of the house.

25:13.720 --> 25:17.307
So, how many chandeliers were there?
Tell us everything.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.935
Well, I only saw three.

25:21.811 --> 25:24.439
Actually, I saw eight.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.609
-And they were all made of gold.
- Wow!

25:28.193 --> 25:32.822
Idalia, dear. Don't gossip. Let's go.

25:40.872 --> 25:42.415
She's always does this.

25:57.097 --> 26:00.475
What do you like about wine?
I have never had a taste in my life.

26:04.062 --> 26:04.896
Here.

26:10.652 --> 26:11.611
Try some.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.338
So none of the neighbors see.

27:06.333 --> 27:07.709
You did well today.

27:09.002 --> 27:13.340
The woman who was waiting
with Santina outside the doctor's office.

27:13.423 --> 27:17.427
Which one? Anna "cross-toes"?
Or Pina with the glasses?

27:18.511 --> 27:21.723
"Cross-toes?" Is that what you just said?

27:22.432 --> 27:26.853
We call her Cross-Toes because
she always complains about her feet.

27:27.437 --> 27:30.523
But wears the shoes of a young woman.

27:31.900 --> 27:35.195
One time she even got
a pedicure in Palermo.

27:35.278 --> 27:38.114
She doesn't know
color can't make what's crooked straight.

27:43.536 --> 27:46.498
So you do gossip?

28:40.760 --> 28:42.637
I made you something.

29:30.101 --> 29:32.061
You need to get dressed.

29:32.645 --> 29:35.064
You're going with Biagia
to sign some papers.

29:35.148 --> 29:37.150
-Didn't you hear me calling you?
-What?

29:37.984 --> 29:40.820
It's about the estate.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.115
You have an appointment
at the lawyer's office this morning.

29:58.505 --> 30:02.425
You need to sign here, here and here.

30:07.055 --> 30:09.224
As the wife of the eldest son,

30:09.307 --> 30:12.185
you are the inheritor,
you and your daughter.

30:19.275 --> 30:20.819
I can't sign this.

30:29.077 --> 30:32.789
Why the hell did you put me
in that position?

30:32.872 --> 30:36.251
Filomena, you should have told me sooner
what you were planning.

30:36.334 --> 30:37.961
I told you this morning.

30:38.044 --> 30:42.465
You didn't say you were giving me
your house and family land.

30:45.385 --> 30:46.678
I don't belong here.

30:47.178 --> 30:48.972
It's also for my granddaughter.

30:51.474 --> 30:54.394
Amy, Nunzio needs your help!

31:06.489 --> 31:08.992
The Mayor
doesn't speak any English.

31:13.162 --> 31:16.708
Finally, someone
who can explain how we drive here.

31:16.791 --> 31:20.962
He wasn't looking, and he hit my car.
Make him understand.

31:22.922 --> 31:25.008
- Let me talk to him.
-Yes, yes. Go ahead.

31:27.302 --> 31:29.762
Tell him
that if he doesn't move his car,

31:29.846 --> 31:31.306
I'll call the Carabinieri.

32:05.715 --> 32:07.842
Say hello to Cornwall for me!

32:12.764 --> 32:13.848
Lentils.

32:15.224 --> 32:17.185
They're from my land.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.730
For helping my son Nunzio.

32:28.988 --> 32:29.948
Was I right?!

32:31.366 --> 32:33.284
Am I your beloved mayor,
yes or no?!

32:37.121 --> 32:38.164
Mother!

32:48.591 --> 32:50.343
Who gave you those?

32:50.426 --> 32:54.305
Nunzio's mother
insisted I bring them to you.

32:54.389 --> 32:57.100
Good. So, you sided with Nunzio.

33:09.445 --> 33:16.285
Listen, please excuse me about before,
the lawyer and the land…

33:16.369 --> 33:19.288
Amy, we have a saying here.

33:19.372 --> 33:21.499
"Home for
as long as you need it to be

33:21.582 --> 33:23.126
and land as far as the eye can see."

33:23.209 --> 33:25.628
I have to
clean these lentils.

33:25.712 --> 33:28.506
Can we just talk about the land, please?

33:28.589 --> 33:31.634
I can't be like Widow Dirty Lentils.

33:32.552 --> 33:36.431
Her husband lost a tooth
when she didn't clean them well.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.641
So, you won't answer?

33:42.645 --> 33:45.273
You know, others come and go,
but we stay here,

33:45.356 --> 33:46.566
We protect our own.

33:47.442 --> 33:50.069
Like you did today. You're one of us.

33:50.153 --> 33:52.572
Whether you know it or not.
That's the way it is.

34:18.431 --> 34:21.434
Filomena is waiting for you at the church.

34:21.517 --> 34:23.186
We're here to watch Idalia.

34:26.355 --> 34:28.733
Go, she's waiting.

34:31.486 --> 34:35.948
And Madonna mia,
take my sweater to cover your shoulders.

35:19.951 --> 35:23.830
I prayed to her
when you and Lino got married.

35:25.081 --> 35:27.708
And I prayed when my son was dying.

35:28.334 --> 35:30.711
Today I pray to her again.

35:36.551 --> 35:38.469
After all that has happened,

35:39.637 --> 35:42.807
now, I know you might want to go

35:44.058 --> 35:45.685
and never come back.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.896
But I pray and hope

35:50.356 --> 35:53.067
that you now
want to build something with me.

35:55.570 --> 35:56.904
I want you to come back.

35:59.198 --> 36:02.076
And I want Castelleone
to be like a home to you.

36:04.078 --> 36:04.912
Of course,

36:05.955 --> 36:07.123
if you want that.

36:11.210 --> 36:14.046
Filomena, I'm not sure that I--

36:15.464 --> 36:17.800
I have said my piece.

36:19.302 --> 36:22.763
Think about it.

38:32.852 --> 38:34.186
Honey.

39:20.024 --> 39:22.443
Hello. I'm Antonio.

39:23.986 --> 39:26.238
You found the family land?

39:27.406 --> 39:30.284
Lino's grandfather planted those trees.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.327
What?

39:31.911 --> 39:34.288
When we were little boys,

39:34.830 --> 39:39.627
Lino wrote his name
on the well by the peach tree.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.254
You knew my dad?

39:43.339 --> 39:47.051
We played soccer together, even
when Lino didn't have the right shoes.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.391
He must have told you to call me that.

39:53.474 --> 39:56.018
Yes, I am Tonino.

40:18.541 --> 40:22.294
You should have your family come
to Castelleone. Next week.

40:22.878 --> 40:24.255
For your birthday.

40:24.338 --> 40:25.673
-Here?
-Yes, here.

40:25.756 --> 40:27.466
Invite them for the procession.

40:28.217 --> 40:30.636
Tell them they are welcome in my home.

40:45.568 --> 40:47.111
Who is Sant'Anna?

40:49.155 --> 40:52.575
The mother of Mary.
She's the mother of all mothers.

40:53.159 --> 40:56.954
Her Saint's Day falls
on the same day as your birthday.

40:57.037 --> 41:00.791
She's the patron saint
of widows and travelers.

41:12.761 --> 41:15.139
We don't get many guests.

41:15.222 --> 41:17.683
I hope this is okay for your family.

41:18.267 --> 41:23.147
My dad grew up
in a town of 300 people.

41:23.230 --> 41:25.065
There are more similarities

41:25.149 --> 41:29.153
between East Texas
and Castelleone than you think.

42:14.573 --> 42:16.951
Welcome to Castelleone.

42:23.582 --> 42:26.710
Help them with their luggage.

42:57.199 --> 42:59.577
I want to make you

42:59.660 --> 43:02.371
something traditional

43:02.454 --> 43:04.873
and unforgettable.

43:05.374 --> 43:06.417
Translate.

43:20.556 --> 43:22.474
Let's make caponata.

43:25.477 --> 43:26.979
Lino's recipe.

44:50.479 --> 44:52.231
And as with everything,

44:53.190 --> 44:54.566
always finish with love.

45:47.995 --> 45:50.622
I've decided
to sign the documents.

45:53.542 --> 45:54.918
I want to come back.

46:01.258 --> 46:03.886
I have to show you something at the house.

46:12.227 --> 46:13.729
Open that drawer.

46:15.147 --> 46:17.941
These clothes are
to use if I go to the hospital.

46:18.025 --> 46:20.277
There are enough
for three days and nights.

46:20.360 --> 46:22.863
So Biagia doesn't worry about laundry.

46:24.281 --> 46:26.116
Open the next drawer.

46:27.826 --> 46:30.120
These are the clothes I will be buried in.

46:30.704 --> 46:33.457
Why are you telling me this?

46:33.540 --> 46:38.212
So both of my daughters
know where these clothes are.

46:41.590 --> 46:43.133
When you get to my age,

46:45.010 --> 46:47.805
you understand
that we are all passing through life.

46:48.388 --> 46:50.474
Here the old people used to say,

46:50.557 --> 46:53.268
"Castelleone is the place
where Jesus forgot his shirt."

46:53.352 --> 46:55.354
According to some it meant

46:56.605 --> 46:59.441
it's a place worth forgetting,

47:00.067 --> 47:02.402
a place where you leave and never return.

47:02.986 --> 47:07.324
But I like to think it means
we are a place worthy enough

47:08.575 --> 47:10.786
for Jesus to pass through.

47:10.869 --> 47:12.246
-Understand?
-Yes.

47:17.459 --> 47:24.174
This whole time, I thought
I was staying here for Idalia.

47:25.509 --> 47:26.385
But…

47:28.804 --> 47:30.305
I found this instead.

47:33.475 --> 47:36.436
Lino certainly
would have been happy about this.

47:40.732 --> 47:46.613
Lino would sneak up here to read
when he was supposed to be working.

47:49.867 --> 47:54.663
If you'd like, you can use this room
when you come back here.

47:56.373 --> 48:00.168
For whatever you want, your art.
Like you do in Los Angeles.

48:01.670 --> 48:04.172
I know
that it's important to you.

48:05.299 --> 48:08.844
You make things beautiful. I saw that.

48:13.140 --> 48:14.224
So did your son.

48:16.602 --> 48:17.519
Yes.

48:19.021 --> 48:23.150
You two were like two forks
eating off of the same plate.
