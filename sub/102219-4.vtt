How's it different from an omelet?

05:08.725 --> 05:11.811
I wanted to make
a friggin' frittata. Okay? I actually did.

05:11.894 --> 05:14.856
We don't get cell reception
in my apartment, Internet was down.

05:14.939 --> 05:17.984
Only Ben knows how to reset it.
I have this ringing in my ear,

05:18.067 --> 05:21.029
so I wanted to look that up,
but couldn't because the Internet--

05:21.112 --> 05:22.905
-Tinnitus.
-Uh, sure, whatever.

05:22.989 --> 05:26.409
Point is, if Ben was here,
I wouldn't have even had to look it up

05:26.492 --> 05:28.995
because he's so much
smarter and better than me.

05:29.078 --> 05:33.875
And everything in my life is just
a lot better whenever he's with me.

05:35.084 --> 05:36.294
[Annie sighs]

05:36.377 --> 05:38.087
You don't have tinnitus.

05:40.631 --> 05:46.512
So, I, uh, purchased some concert tickets.

You'll say I'm bribing him, but it works.

I'd run around
scooping up as many as I could.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.982
The net would snap their little wings.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.359
Jesus. No wonder you became a therapist.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.612
Dad would stand still
so they'd land on him.

06:02.695 --> 06:06.074
Then what? You'd take 'em home
and let 'em fly around like a weird pet?

06:06.157 --> 06:08.493
Uh, mount them in decorative shadow boxes.

06:08.576 --> 06:12.371
The point is,
you can't use a net to get what you want.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.875
That's really an elaborate metaphor.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.420
You can't make someone like you.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.433

-Because he's gonna… For real.
-[Beth] I know.

06:55.456 --> 06:57.333
-I know.
-We're dead.

06:57.917 --> 07:02.004
-Okay, let's focus on the positive.
-They'll never find our bodies.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.757
We get to start over,
which is a good thing.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.884
Assuming we can even deliver gang friend.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.262
Then they'll move us
anywhere in the country.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.556
Do Alaska and Hawaii count?

07:11.639 --> 07:13.349
-Probably.
-To do what?

07:13.432 --> 07:15.768
-Whatever we want.
-What about Puerto Rico?

07:15.852 --> 07:18.104
Uh, if it's
under their jurisdiction, why not?

07:18.187 --> 07:19.188
They'll set us up?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.441
House, car, job--

07:21.524 --> 07:22.733
American Samoa?

07:24.610 --> 07:26.863
Do you want to live in American Samoa?

07:26.946 --> 07:28.489
I want to know that I could.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.867
It'll be like we never existed.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.287

07:36.080 --> 07:38.875
Oh. One thing. Not a big deal. Real minor.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.586
-All the territories count, Annie.
-Even Guam.

07:41.669 --> 07:42.670
Okay.

07:44.422 --> 07:45.548
The hit man.

07:46.090 --> 07:50.803
I mean, wouldn't this whole deal
go away if jaboy gets whacked?

07:55.850 --> 07:57.310
One other thing.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.855
[Ruby] Where the hell did he go?

08:02.106 --> 08:04.025
Son of a bitch!

08:05.860 --> 08:08.446
He changed his number,
pulled his child out of school.

08:08.529 --> 08:10.156
The man completely disappeared.

08:10.239 --> 08:15.661
Yeah, that's what we do
before we, uh, get to work, so to speak.

08:15.745 --> 08:18.039
But we don't want him to get to work.

08:18.122 --> 08:20.666
-I can't just call off your hit.
-[Annie] Why not?

08:21.250 --> 08:22.502

Look, I vouched for you guys, all right?

08:27.006 --> 08:28.758
We'll still pay him.

08:28.841 --> 08:30.635
It just makes <i>me</i> look bad.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.220
Well, what if we pay you, too?

08:32.303 --> 08:34.138
Yeah, like a restocking fee.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.398
It's on my list, okay?

13:37.233 --> 13:40.152
Why does he want us
to go shopping for him, anyway?

13:40.236 --> 13:43.030
How's that guy gonna pick up
a 24-pack of Charmin?

13:43.113 --> 13:44.865
There are people to help him.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.368
I'm just glad
we're on the outside of his pants.

13:47.993 --> 13:48.994
What's next?

13:49.078 --> 13:50.371
-Duct tape.
-[Annie] Excuse me.

13:50.454 --> 13:52.748
God forbid I get Go-Gurt
but you get Pop-Tarts?

13:52.831 --> 13:54.166
The kids are missing Dean.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.376
You're just as fun.

13:55.459 --> 13:57.461
He burps their names good night.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.965
[scoffs] I mean, that's easy.
Anybody could do that.

14:01.048 --> 14:03.425
-It's harder than you'd think.
-Is it?

14:11.892 --> 14:16.188

Good… night… Annie.

14:16.272 --> 14:17.898
[continues burping]

14:23.195 --> 14:24.321
Is that everything?

14:26.115 --> 14:29.743
Uh, let's see. We've got
"the garden hose, the roofing nails,

14:30.327 --> 14:33.038

14:33.664 --> 14:35.708

14:36.333 --> 14:39.545
Yeah, and "five bags of fertilizer."

14:44.508 --> 14:45.509
What?

14:47.428 --> 14:49.722
[sighs] These aren't groceries.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.808
I know. It's a mix of sundries.

14:54.351 --> 14:55.936
[mouthing]

14:57.688 --> 14:58.647

14:58.731 --> 14:59.982
[whispers] A bomb.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.527
-Jesus. Just say it.
-There are people here.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.863
Can you fill me in?

15:06.530 --> 15:07.948
Okay. Okay. Okay.

15:08.032 --> 15:11.827
Remember when we, uh, did karaoke
and you sang "Lovely Day"?

15:11.911 --> 15:13.329
-Yeah.
-How did you do?

15:13.412 --> 15:14.705
I crushed it.

15:14.788 --> 15:17.750
Not that time. The time at my birthday.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.793
I blew the roof off the place.

15:19.877 --> 15:24.214
Not that birthday. The other birthday.
When you had a little cold coming on.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.425
-Oh, God.
-How'd you do?

15:28.260 --> 15:29.136
I bom…

15:32.264 --> 15:33.641
[typing]

15:38.103 --> 15:39.355
Yeah.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.273
Hmm.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.150
[Beth] What's it say?

15:44.026 --> 15:47.112
That we have enough here
to blow up a church choir.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.781
Oh, God.

15:48.864 --> 15:51.408
Then again,
I don't understand metric proportions.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.994
So could be more like a… jury?

15:54.078 --> 15:56.330
-Oh, my God.
-Maybe a bus.

15:56.413 --> 15:59.208
-What are the nails for?
-Shredding flesh.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.714
-We can't give this to him.
-I don't see how we don't.

16:05.798 --> 16:09.051
You wanna be responsible
for a bus full of choir jurors?

16:09.134 --> 16:12.596
-'Cause I'll never sleep again.
-Know where you'll really never sleep?

16:12.680 --> 16:14.556
Curled up with Deansie in a cell.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.474
All right.

16:15.557 --> 16:18.394
'Cause that's where we're going
if gang friend gets whacked.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.020
It's not coed, Annie.

16:20.104 --> 16:22.606
News flash, sis,
the women's ones are worse.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.567
-She's right. I saw this thing on MSNBC.
-Okay.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.821
The guards make 'em, you know,
do sex stuff to each other.

16:28.904 --> 16:30.823
-No!
-While they watch.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.199
Thank you. Got it.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.327
So, I mean, if we're in the same block,

16:35.411 --> 16:37.746
it's just a matter of time
before we have to…

16:37.830 --> 16:39.540
Can I have a juice box?

16:40.124 --> 16:41.375
Of course, honey.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.842
I want Daddy.

16:56.932 --> 16:59.393
[Ruby] There was one
where the warden got in on it, too.

16:59.476 --> 17:00.811
Taped it and everything.

17:00.894 --> 17:01.895
Let's do this.

17:08.152 --> 17:08.986
[Annie] Ow!

17:09.945 --> 17:12.865
You know what? On second thought,
mind putting 'em up top?

17:13.490 --> 17:15.868
-Did you find him?
-[Troy] Yeah.

17:15.951 --> 17:18.787
-So, it's taken care of?
-Kinda.

17:18.871 --> 17:23.083
What's "kinda"? Either he's
murdering a man or he's not.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.501
He wants to talk to her.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.879
Well, can you patch me through?

17:26.962 --> 17:30.716
[grunts] No, we're not doing
any more errands for you.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.926
Everyone chill. He'll call you.

17:33.010 --> 17:35.804
For your information,
the store has a delivery service.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.848
Not to mention,
there's an entire industry--

17:37.931 --> 17:40.267
I'm on a million watch lists, butt cheeks.

17:40.350 --> 17:43.020
Well, whoever it's for,
I really hope they deserve it.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.397
Believe me, Mom has it comin'.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.070
-Mom?
-[Troy] Yeah.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.781
And at 75, I gotta do it
while she's still around.

17:54.990 --> 17:55.949
Jesus.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.911
Just glad the chemo didn't
take her out before I got the chance.

17:58.994 --> 18:02.081
Okay. You know what? That's it.
We're done here. Okay? We good?

18:02.164 --> 18:03.957
She'll really appreciate this.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.551
Huh?

18:14.635 --> 18:18.263
It's a surprise for beating cancer, twice.
