WEBVTT

00:01.566 --> 00:02.733
No, no, no.

00:02.800 --> 00:04.866
Don't touch that dial.

00:04.933 --> 00:07.733
Here's what's
on my mind, tonight.

00:10.133 --> 00:11.833
Donald's a hypnotherapist.

00:11.900 --> 00:13.800
In a moment I'm going
to count to three.

00:13.866 --> 00:16.366
And he really enjoys his work.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.100
And you'll remember nothing
that happens.

00:18.166 --> 00:21.300
But will a colleague
put an end to his game?

00:21.366 --> 00:22.866
You're not gonna tell anybody,
are you, Stuart?

00:22.933 --> 00:24.500
I don't know.

00:24.566 --> 00:27.500
Or will Donald
dream up a way out?

00:27.566 --> 00:29.500
I hear you could make a man
do just about anything.

00:29.566 --> 00:30.533
Find out..

00:30.600 --> 00:32.266
Oh, I'm loving this.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.633
...on "Freddy's Nightmares."

00:55.300 --> 00:57.700
You're in Springwood now.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.833
And you're all mine.

01:24.833 --> 01:27.500
'Mrs. Lowe, I'm gonna count

01:24.833 --> 01:27.500
backwards from five'

01:27.566 --> 01:30.400
on each number you will go
deeper and deeper

01:30.466 --> 01:32.466
in to your hypnotic state.

01:32.533 --> 01:35.166
When I reach zero,
you'll be as deep as you can be.

01:35.233 --> 01:37.466
Do you understand?

01:37.533 --> 01:39.633
- Yes.
- Good, then here we go.

01:40.733 --> 01:42.933
Five.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.900
Four.

01:44.966 --> 01:46.833
Three.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.766
Two.

01:48.833 --> 01:50.533
One.

01:51.633 --> 01:54.033
How do you feel, Mrs. Lowe?

01:54.100 --> 01:56.166
Fine.

01:56.233 --> 01:59.433
Mrs. Lowe, your right arm
is becoming lighter than air.

02:01.333 --> 02:03.266
So light
that it will float away

02:03.333 --> 02:05.500
if you're not careful.

02:05.566 --> 02:08.733
Okay, Mrs. Lowe,
your arm is now back

02:08.800 --> 02:10.933
to it's normal weight.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.966
Now, in our last session

02:15.033 --> 02:16.200
we came to the conclusion that

02:16.266 --> 02:17.933
you've lost your self esteem

02:18.000 --> 02:20.233
do you remember that?

02:20.300 --> 02:24.100
You said you feel ugly
because your husband

02:24.166 --> 02:26.100
no longer finds you attractive.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.533
I moved into a hotel.

02:30.566 --> 02:32.533
I know, Mrs. Lowe.

02:34.333 --> 02:38.600
Would you like me to
...help you with your problem?

02:38.666 --> 02:40.066
Hm.

02:40.133 --> 02:42.300
Very good, Mrs. Lowe.

02:43.633 --> 02:46.533
Now, in a moment,
I'm going to count to three.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.466
You will then open your eyes
and feel completely refreshed.

02:51.533 --> 02:52.933
When you see me..

02:53.000 --> 02:55.100
...I will appear to you
as your husband..

02:58.500 --> 03:00.500
...Todd.

03:00.566 --> 03:02.700
You will be completely alone
with him.

03:03.766 --> 03:05.333
Do you understand?

03:06.466 --> 03:08.100
'Good. One more thing.'

03:09.166 --> 03:11.933
If I say the words hocus-pocus

03:12.000 --> 03:14.166
you will go back
in to a deep

03:14.233 --> 03:16.200
'hypnotic trance.'

03:16.266 --> 03:18.166
And you'll remember nothing
that happens

03:18.233 --> 03:20.900
between now and then,
do you understand?

03:22.100 --> 03:23.600
Then here we go.

03:23.700 --> 03:25.133
One.

03:26.833 --> 03:28.300
Two.

03:29.433 --> 03:30.900
Three.

03:33.833 --> 03:34.933
Todd?

03:37.900 --> 03:39.366
What are you doing here?

03:39.433 --> 03:42.300
Uh, Dr. Crowley asked me
to come by.

03:45.066 --> 03:47.000
Oh, I'm sorry, honey, I didn't
mean to bother you with my--

03:47.066 --> 03:49.333
I think..

03:49.400 --> 03:52.200
...you are thesexiest..

03:52.266 --> 03:55.533
...most beautiful women
on the face of this planet.

04:07.900 --> 04:09.333
Oh, Todd.

04:40.233 --> 04:42.600
Donald, I just wanted to..

04:42.666 --> 04:43.933
Stuart!

04:44.000 --> 04:46.833
I...I'm in the middle
of-of-of a session.

04:46.900 --> 04:49.233
I-I, I'll come back later.

04:51.366 --> 04:52.666
Oh, my..

04:52.733 --> 04:54.200
Hocus-pocus.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.333
Oh, God.

05:02.833 --> 05:04.400
Listen, Stuart.

05:04.466 --> 05:06.700
That, that wasn't
what it looked like.

05:06.766 --> 05:09.266
Yeah, I, I was trying,
uh, an experimental therap

05:09.333 --> 05:11.400
to improve the patients
self image.

05:11.466 --> 05:13.433
- You were raping her.
- Rape?

05:13.500 --> 05:16.133
It would only be rape, if she
was forced against her will.

05:16.200 --> 05:19.700
Look, she started it,
she thought I was her husband.

05:19.766 --> 05:21.233
You're not
her husband, Donald.

05:21.300 --> 05:24.433
So, my new hypnotic technique
is full proof.

05:24.500 --> 05:25.700
She'll never remember
what happened

05:25.766 --> 05:27.900
and what the lady
doesn't know, won't hurt her.

05:29.500 --> 05:32.300
Stuart, Stuart, we've been
through a lot together.

05:32.366 --> 05:33.966
You know me.

05:34.033 --> 05:36.200
I thought; I did.

05:36.266 --> 05:38.800
You're not gonna tell anybody,
are you, Stuart?

05:38.866 --> 05:40.833
I don't know,
I have to think.

05:43.233 --> 05:47.200
You are now deeply
under my control.

05:48.133 --> 05:50.100
Oh, I'm loving this.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.733
When you wake..

05:52.800 --> 05:54.900
...you will love Freddy.

05:55.800 --> 05:59.000
You will desire Freddy.

05:59.066 --> 06:02.433
You will want Freddy.

06:02.500 --> 06:05.433
You'll even go
to the grave for Freddy.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.933
Ow!

06:28.000 --> 06:31.033
What is this?

06:32.233 --> 06:34.333
It's a jawbreaker, doctor.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.700
It's candy.

06:36.866 --> 06:38.366
That's funny.

06:38.433 --> 06:40.266
A guy came into the hospital
a few weeks back

06:40.333 --> 06:42.166
who choked to death,
on one of these.

06:42.233 --> 06:43.833
Right in this hotel.

06:44.933 --> 06:46.700
Small world.

06:48.966 --> 06:51.866
Derby, I cannot marry
a man who smokes

06:51.933 --> 06:53.900
as much as you do.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.666
You can't marry me anyway.

06:58.733 --> 07:00.733
Not until you get that divorce
you've been talking about.

07:02.633 --> 07:05.000
I will, soon.

07:05.066 --> 07:06.800
Trust me.

07:06.866 --> 07:09.066
Sure, doesn't look like it.

07:09.133 --> 07:11.100
You're still sleeping
with your husband.

07:12.233 --> 07:13.700
Yes, but I don't enjoy it.

07:14.866 --> 07:16.533
I don't.

07:17.866 --> 07:19.200
Besides, why should
I get a divorce

07:19.266 --> 07:21.400
when you're just gonna die
of cancer anyway.

07:23.166 --> 07:25.733
When are you gonna
stop smoking?

07:26.633 --> 07:28.333
Soon, I promise.

07:29.700 --> 07:30.833
I just gave up my whole life

07:30.900 --> 07:32.566
to move to this
godforsaken town

07:32.633 --> 07:34.000
to be here with you.

07:34.066 --> 07:36.633
I gave up my job,
my apartment..

07:36.700 --> 07:39.233
I'm living in this
damn hotel.

07:39.300 --> 07:41.233
It's a little stressful, okay.

07:44.066 --> 07:45.866
And what if I don't get
this new job.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.966
You will.

07:48.033 --> 07:49.533
I wish I was
as sure as you are.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.833
Do you know, how hard it is
to land a CPA job

07:52.900 --> 07:54.066
when you're dyslexic.

07:54.133 --> 07:56.100
When you get your numbers
all mixed up?

08:01.600 --> 08:03.800
Derby, what if
I introduce you

08:03.866 --> 08:07.000
to the best hypnotherapist
in Springwood.

08:07.066 --> 08:09.033
He can make you stop smoking.

08:13.900 --> 08:15.333
Come.

08:18.833 --> 08:20.666
Mrs. Lowe.

08:20.733 --> 08:22.666
What a pleasant surprise.

08:22.733 --> 08:24.566
'What can I do for you?'

08:24.633 --> 08:26.200
Well..

08:26.266 --> 08:27.600
Uh..

08:27.666 --> 08:29.300
I went home after
our session this morning

08:29.366 --> 08:31.366
and I took a nap..

08:31.433 --> 08:34.233
...and I had the strangest
dream.

08:34.300 --> 08:36.233
Oh, w-what did you dream?

08:37.266 --> 08:39.366
I dreamt that
during our session

08:39.433 --> 08:42.200
you hypnotized me
in to believing; you were Todd.

08:43.566 --> 08:46.566
And then you made love to me.

08:46.633 --> 08:51.300
Th-that's a&lt;T
uh, dream, Mrs. Lowe.

08:51.366 --> 08:54.533
Uh, of course, you-you kno
it never happened.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.400
I know.

08:56.466 --> 08:59.500
I was just wondering; what you
thought the dream meant?

08:59.566 --> 09:01.300
Ah.

09:01.366 --> 09:03.966
Mrs. Lowe, uh,
your dream was probably

09:04.033 --> 09:07.366
a deep-seated desire
buried somewhere

09:07.433 --> 09:08.800
in your subconscious.

09:08.866 --> 09:11.133
You know, it's not unusual
for a female patient

09:11.200 --> 09:14.400
to feel, uh, an attraction
for a therapist.

09:15.900 --> 09:19.200
That's funny,
that's how I interpreted it too.

09:19.266 --> 09:24.066
Only it's not buried
in my subconscious, Dr. Crowley.

09:24.133 --> 09:26.300
It's very much up front..

09:26.366 --> 09:27.633
...where the sex drive is?

09:27.700 --> 09:29.633
What are you saying?

09:29.700 --> 09:31.600
I'm saying..

09:31.666 --> 09:33.933
...that I want you, doctor

09:34.000 --> 09:35.800
I have a surprise for you.

09:36.733 --> 09:38.000
You're gonna like it.

09:38.066 --> 09:40.800
What are you doing?

09:40.866 --> 09:43.366
You're well read on Freud,
aren't you, doctor?

09:43.433 --> 09:44.733
Yes.

09:45.966 --> 09:47.900
Then you figure it out.

10:08.133 --> 10:09.433
I'm suppose to go in there
and talk to him?

10:09.500 --> 10:11.366
If you feel like
this is something you have to..

10:32.300 --> 10:34.233
I can't do that.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.233
Maybe..

10:39.300 --> 10:41.400
...I can get
someone else to do it.

10:44.166 --> 10:45.600
Excuse me.

10:45.666 --> 10:47.633
- Dr. Crowley?
- Yes.

10:48.833 --> 10:50.266
I'm Derby Brown.

10:50.333 --> 10:53.333
A friend of Dr. Helen Veneer.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.566
I hear, you can make a man do
just about anything

10:55.633 --> 10:57.500
under hypnosis.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.600
Yes..

11:00.666 --> 11:02.700
...yes, I can.

11:05.333 --> 11:08.233
Mr. Brown, you right arm
is becoming lighter than air

11:09.466 --> 11:11.400
so light that it will
try to float away

11:11.466 --> 11:13.033
if you're not careful.

11:13.100 --> 11:14.266
Okay, Mr. Brown.

11:14.333 --> 11:17.133
Your arm is now back
to it's normal...weight.

11:19.366 --> 11:21.900
Very good, Mr. Brown.

11:21.966 --> 11:23.533
When I count to three

11:23.600 --> 11:25.066
you'll wake up,
feeling refreshed.

11:25.133 --> 11:27.100
Only one thing
would have changed.

11:28.466 --> 11:30.233
Whenever you take a puff
of a cigarette

11:30.300 --> 11:33.233
it will taste like
...human excrement.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.133
In fact it will taste so bad

11:36.200 --> 11:37.466
that even the strongest urge

11:37.533 --> 11:39.133
to light up will be nauseating.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.833
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

11:41.966 --> 11:43.233
Very good.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.300
There is one other thing,
Mr. Brown.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.066
I want you to do everything
I'm about to say

11:50.133 --> 11:52.733
to the letter,
until you hear the word..

11:54.133 --> 11:55.533
...abracadabra.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.400
When you hear
the word abracadabra

11:57.466 --> 11:59.233
you will forget
this suggestion completely

11:59.300 --> 12:01.300
you will not do it
and you'll remember nothing

12:01.366 --> 12:02.766
of this session.

12:02.833 --> 12:05.100
Except the smoking part,
do you understand?

12:05.200 --> 12:06.433
Yes.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.333
Good.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.033
Here's, what I want you to do.

12:10.100 --> 12:12.800
I notice you have an alarm..

12:12.866 --> 12:15.266
...on your watch.

12:15.333 --> 12:18.766
I want you to set your alarm
to go off at 3 o'clock today.

12:18.833 --> 12:21.066
When you hear your alarm..

12:21.133 --> 12:23.366
...you will do the following.

12:28.966 --> 12:30.500
Stuart.

12:30.566 --> 12:32.333
'What do you want, Donald?'

12:32.400 --> 12:34.000
Would you mind stepping
into my office for a moment?

12:34.066 --> 12:35.766
We really have to talk.

12:50.233 --> 12:51.833
Make it fast,
my 3 o'clock patient's

12:51.900 --> 12:53.533
already here.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.000
Okay, what was Mrs. Lowe

12:58.066 --> 13:00.000
doing in your office, Stuart?

13:00.066 --> 13:01.533
She asked to see me.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.666
Why would she do
a thing like that?

13:03.733 --> 13:07.366
Because she needed someone
to talk, Donald.

13:07.433 --> 13:10.900
And since I'm your immediate
superior she choose me.

13:12.300 --> 13:15.400
And, uh, what did she need
to talk about?

13:15.466 --> 13:17.466
Your new technique
didn't hold, Donald.

13:17.533 --> 13:19.766
All of the sordid details
of this morning

13:19.833 --> 13:22.133
are coming back
to her gradually.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.300
That can't be.
My method works.

13:24.366 --> 13:26.433
Oh, come on!

13:26.500 --> 13:29.933
I-I've listened to your theories
on experimental techniques

13:30.000 --> 13:31.433
for years now, Donald.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.966
And never once,
never once, do you mention

13:34.033 --> 13:36.800
concern for the patient.

13:36.866 --> 13:38.666
No, no, all you care about
is gettin' written up

13:38.733 --> 13:41.400
in the medical journals.

13:41.466 --> 13:44.333
And I guess this morning
I saw the other reason.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.333
You've got it all wrong, Stuart.

13:47.866 --> 13:49.633
Maybe.

13:49.700 --> 13:52.333
Maybe but Mrs. Lowe doesn't.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.733
And as soon as
she remembers it all

13:53.800 --> 13:56.333
she's going
to the authorities.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.533
I'm sure she can be persuaded
not to talk.

13:59.700 --> 14:01.233
No, I doubt it.

14:06.300 --> 14:08.266
- Can I help you?
- Mrs. Lowe?

14:08.333 --> 14:09.866
Yes.

14:13.466 --> 14:15.200
What?

14:17.300 --> 14:19.233
What is it?

14:24.800 --> 14:26.666
Question now is..

14:26.733 --> 14:28.466
...what are you gonna do,
Stuart?

14:28.533 --> 14:30.200
Are you gonna talk?

14:30.266 --> 14:32.033
Oh, I won't have to.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.933
Mrs. Lowe will do all
the talking necessary.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.800
And if she doesn't?

14:38.133 --> 14:39.733
Then I will.

15:13.800 --> 15:16.100
'Abracadabra.'

15:26.066 --> 15:27.266
Hello?

15:27.333 --> 15:29.866
Mr. Brown, a-are you alright?

15:29.933 --> 15:33.533
- Who is this?
- 'It's Dr. Crowley.'

15:33.600 --> 15:35.966
Did, did you call me
or did I call you?

15:36.033 --> 15:38.000
You called me.

15:38.066 --> 15:39.266
It's strange.

15:39.333 --> 15:42.000
I must have blacked out
or something.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.833
- Do you remember anything?
- 'No.'

15:43.900 --> 15:45.266
'Nothing at all.'

15:45.333 --> 15:47.566
'Boy, this is weird.'

15:47.633 --> 15:49.400
Oh, I'm sure you'll be
just fine, Mr. Brown.

15:49.466 --> 15:50.933
J-just try to relax.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.233
Oh-oh, and-and call me
if you do remember anything.

15:54.300 --> 15:56.066
It may be helpful in determining

15:56.133 --> 15:57.433
the cause of your blackout.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.633
Okay. Thanks, doc.

16:26.233 --> 16:27.966
Mrs. Lowe was found
strangled to death

16:28.033 --> 16:30.333
'in her hotel room
this afternoon.'

16:30.400 --> 16:33.266
My God! She's dead?

16:33.333 --> 16:34.600
As long as I have known you

16:34.666 --> 16:36.966
I never would have thought
you could do such a thing!

16:37.033 --> 16:38.966
Wait a minute,
w-what is that suppose to mean?

16:39.033 --> 16:41.166
Well, who else would have
wanted her dead?

16:41.233 --> 16:44.633
I don't believe
what you're saying.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.000
We're supposed to be friends.

16:46.066 --> 16:48.900
I mean, accusing me of bad
ethics is a subjective debate.

16:48.966 --> 16:51.566
But murder
is an outlandish insult.

16:51.633 --> 16:52.966
Do they know
when she was killed?

16:53.033 --> 16:57.233
Someone heard her scream
around 3 o'clock. Why?

16:57.300 --> 16:59.366
O-oh, we-well there
you have it, Stuart.

16:59.433 --> 17:01.733
I was with you at 3 o'clock.

17:01.800 --> 17:04.000
Right here, in this office.

17:05.766 --> 17:07.666
Well, I don't know
what to think anymore.

17:07.733 --> 17:10.466
Wait a minute, Stuart.
Where are you going?

17:10.533 --> 17:11.633
- Where are you going?
- To the police.

17:11.700 --> 17:13.000
What for?

17:13.066 --> 17:14.700
Because in our profession

17:14.766 --> 17:17.233
the line of ethic
shouldn't move so easily.

17:17.300 --> 17:19.300
You're a fraud, Donald,
a dangerous fraud.

17:19.366 --> 17:20.533
No, wait a minute, please.

17:20.600 --> 17:21.566
I don't know,
maybe you're right.

17:21.633 --> 17:22.933
Maybe I do need help.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.833
But if you just get me
until morning..

17:24.900 --> 17:27.700
so-so I can tell my wife, I..

17:27.766 --> 17:31.533
I don't want Eva to find out
about this from the papers.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.233
And then what?

17:33.300 --> 17:35.633
Look, Stuart,
I didn't kill anyone.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.200
But if you wait until morning

17:37.266 --> 17:40.233
I'll turn myself in
for my sexual misconduct

17:40.300 --> 17:42.933
with Mrs. Lowe,
what do you, what do you say?

17:43.000 --> 17:44.333
How do I know
you won't just leave town?

17:44.400 --> 17:46.800
- I wont.
- I don't know.

17:46.866 --> 17:50.666
Look, Stuart, you've known Eva
almost as long as I have.

17:50.733 --> 17:53.200
Do it for her. Please.

17:55.300 --> 17:56.366
First thing in the morning

17:56.433 --> 17:58.433
if you haven't gone
to the authorities

17:58.500 --> 17:59.966
I will.

18:00.033 --> 18:02.633
- Understood?
- Understood.

18:02.700 --> 18:03.766
Where will you be?

18:03.833 --> 18:05.600
In case I need to contact
you later.

18:05.666 --> 18:08.366
I'll be here.
I'm on duty tonight.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.966
Aah!

18:44.333 --> 18:46.866
- Crowley.
- 'Hello, doc?'

18:46.933 --> 18:48.466
'This is Derby Brown.'

18:48.533 --> 18:50.700
Yes, Mr. Brown,
how are you feeling?

18:50.766 --> 18:52.166
Not so hot.

18:52.233 --> 18:54.266
I just had the worst nightmare.

18:54.333 --> 18:57.700
I just dreamed,
I-I killed a lady.

18:57.766 --> 19:00.233
'I'm scared, doc.
I don't know what to do.'

19:00.300 --> 19:02.166
I'm about to see
another patient.

19:02.233 --> 19:03.633
Why don't you come on over

19:03.700 --> 19:06.333
and I'll see you as soon
as I'm finished with her.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.600
Maybe we can figure out
what caused this

19:08.666 --> 19:10.033
dream of yours.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.066
Well, thank you, doc.

19:12.133 --> 19:14.433
I'm sure it would make me
feel better.

19:22.933 --> 19:24.900
'Come.'

19:26.433 --> 19:27.766
Hi, doc.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.566
'Mr. Brown.'

19:29.633 --> 19:31.700
Come in, come in.

19:31.766 --> 19:33.033
Feeling any better?

19:33.100 --> 19:35.466
No, in fact,
I feel a lot worse.

19:35.533 --> 19:37.900
I don't think that nightmare
was just a nightmare, doc.

19:37.966 --> 19:39.533
Oh, what do you mean?

19:39.600 --> 19:41.833
Well, I just heard a lady
in my hotel was killed.

19:41.900 --> 19:43.600
Right down the hall from me.

19:43.666 --> 19:44.866
Doc, I think
I might have done it

19:44.933 --> 19:46.300
when I blacked out.

19:46.366 --> 19:49.400
God, help me.
I think I really did it!

19:49.466 --> 19:51.600
Mr. Brown, Mr. Brown,
sit, sit down.

19:51.666 --> 19:53.500
Sit down.

19:54.966 --> 19:58.600
When was the last time
you had a smoke?

19:58.666 --> 20:00.633
Uh, not since
this morning. Why?

20:00.700 --> 20:02.800
Well, it's really
very simple, Mr. Brown.

20:02.866 --> 20:04.933
It's not uncommon for a person

20:05.000 --> 20:07.466
suffering withdrawal anxiety

20:07.533 --> 20:09.800
to have nightmares.

20:09.866 --> 20:11.066
You really think
it was a nightmare?

20:11.133 --> 20:12.700
I'd bet on it.

20:14.633 --> 20:17.133
It just seemed so real.

20:17.200 --> 20:21.533
Yeah, well, I-I tell you what,
why don't I put you back under

20:21.600 --> 20:22.933
and we'll see
if we can get to the botto

20:23.000 --> 20:25.533
of it right now, okay?

20:26.500 --> 20:27.900
Okay.

20:27.966 --> 20:29.933
Just lie back.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.000
Close your eyes.

20:33.066 --> 20:35.100
And try to relax.

20:37.466 --> 20:38.966
Now, listen closely..

20:39.033 --> 20:40.933
...to my voice.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.633
I'm going to count backwards
from five.

20:45.933 --> 20:47.433
Four.

20:48.366 --> 20:50.300
Three.

20:50.966 --> 20:51.933
'Two.'

20:52.000 --> 20:53.633
How are you feeling, Mr. Brown?

20:53.700 --> 20:55.366
- Fine.
- Good.

20:55.433 --> 20:56.733
Now, listen carefully.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.500
I want you to set
your watch alarm again.

20:58.566 --> 21:01.233
Set if for
...10 o'clock, tonight.

21:02.433 --> 21:04.066
Now, this is a toy gun..

21:04.133 --> 21:05.633
...Mr. Brown.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.866
It couldn't hurt anyone.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.433
I want you to take it with you

21:10.500 --> 21:12.733
after our session.

21:14.066 --> 21:16.333
When your alarm goes off,
you will come back up

21:16.400 --> 21:18.000
to this floor.

21:18.066 --> 21:22.300
And you'll go to room 2-4-3,
you'll go into that room

21:22.366 --> 21:24.333
and you'll shoot the man inside

21:24.400 --> 21:26.566
with the toy gun,
do you understand?

21:26.633 --> 21:28.100
Yes.

21:28.166 --> 21:29.300
Good.

22:30.133 --> 22:31.466
Dr. Crowley.

22:31.533 --> 22:32.800
Dr. Crowley?

22:32.866 --> 22:34.400
Yes, this is Dr. Veneer.

22:34.466 --> 22:36.000
'Yes, what can I do for you?'

22:36.066 --> 22:37.700
I was just calling
to see how the session

22:37.766 --> 22:39.300
went with my friend
Derby Brown.

22:39.366 --> 22:42.833
Well, it went fine. I think
his smoking days are over.

22:42.900 --> 22:44.500
Oh, that's good.

22:44.566 --> 22:46.033
You know, poor Derby,
he's so nervous all the time

22:46.100 --> 22:47.266
what, with him, you know

22:47.333 --> 22:49.433
just moving here
and finding a new job

22:49.500 --> 22:51.633
and, well,
his dyslexia and all.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.800
Yes, well,
thank you for calling.

22:57.933 --> 22:59.833
Dyslexic?

23:18.900 --> 23:21.266
Mr. Brown.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.933
Uh-uh, you're
in the-the wrong office.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.333
It's, uh..

23:27.366 --> 23:28.800
Abracadabra.

23:29.933 --> 23:32.033
I said, abracadabra.

23:33.033 --> 23:34.600
Aah!

23:36.200 --> 23:37.966
I mean..

23:38.033 --> 23:39.433
...hocus-pocus.

23:42.500 --> 23:44.033
Oh, my God!

23:45.333 --> 23:46.600
What the..

23:50.200 --> 23:52.200
When I count to three..

23:52.266 --> 23:55.766
...you will wake up
completely refreshed.

23:55.833 --> 23:57.266
You won't remember a thing

23:57.333 --> 24:00.500
except that you will want
to turn this channel.

24:00.566 --> 24:03.833
This night, every week

24:03.900 --> 24:07.100
so that I can mess
with you some more.

24:09.233 --> 24:11.100
One.

24:11.166 --> 24:12.600
Two.

24:13.300 --> 24:14.800
Three.

24:23.266 --> 24:25.233
You're in the wrong office

24:28.700 --> 24:29.900
Aah!

24:46.633 --> 24:47.633
- What're you doing?
- What happened?

24:47.700 --> 24:48.666
- Put that back on.
- What's wrong?

24:48.733 --> 24:50.933
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

24:52.933 --> 24:54.300
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

24:54.366 --> 24:56.400
Sorry, doc, there's
been a murder in the hospital.

24:56.466 --> 24:58.866
We think the killer's trapped
somewhere in the building.

24:58.933 --> 25:00.966
Suspect is male about 5'11

25:01.033 --> 25:02.633
Dark hair, dark eyes.

25:02.700 --> 25:04.700
Sorry, I haven't seen him.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.833
I killed somebody, didn't I?

25:27.466 --> 25:29.100
Ha! Ha ha!

25:29.166 --> 25:30.633
Fooled ya.

25:30.700 --> 25:33.200
My heart stopped years ago.

25:33.266 --> 25:34.333
I just like

25:34.400 --> 25:37.433
playin' alive, playin' alive.

25:37.500 --> 25:38.833
The guy in the hospital's

25:38.900 --> 25:40.866
playin' barely alive.

25:40.933 --> 25:42.400
And when I get through
with him

25:42.466 --> 25:45.733
he's gonna be playin' dead.

25:50.733 --> 25:53.733
Anyway, after Dr. Rothman
found Dr. Crowley dead

25:53.800 --> 25:55.433
all hell broke loose,
that's when I found you.

25:55.500 --> 25:57.700
You were despondent
in low-grade shock.

25:57.766 --> 25:59.400
I gave you a sedative,
and I hid you in here.

25:59.466 --> 26:01.566
Do you wanna tell me
what happened?

26:01.633 --> 26:02.933
I'm not sure I know.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.433
Dr. Rothman says that

26:04.500 --> 26:05.466
he saw the man who did it.

26:05.533 --> 26:07.433
Derby, he described you.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.400
I'm afraid he might be right.

26:09.466 --> 26:10.733
I had a dream last night.

26:10.800 --> 26:13.100
Actually, it was more
of a memory than a dream.

26:13.166 --> 26:14.500
What was it?

26:14.566 --> 26:16.800
I, I dreamt Dr. Crowley
hypnotized me

26:16.866 --> 26:18.866
and then had me go
kill this man.

26:18.933 --> 26:20.566
Only somehow
I screwed up and I killed

26:20.633 --> 26:21.800
Dr. Crowley instead.

26:21.866 --> 26:23.400
- It's crazy.
- I know it is.

26:23.466 --> 26:25.533
But I think it really happened.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.533
W-where are my clothes?

26:28.600 --> 26:29.933
I hid them, why?

26:30.000 --> 26:32.200
Well, check my jacket,
if, if I'm right

26:32.266 --> 26:34.400
I put the gun in the pocket.

26:46.666 --> 26:48.800
- But why? How?
- 'I told you.'

26:48.866 --> 26:51.233
Dr. Crowley hypnotized me.

26:51.300 --> 26:53.933
He was gonna help me
stop smoking, remember?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.266
'You sent me to him.'

26:55.333 --> 26:57.266
You've got to believe me.

26:57.333 --> 26:58.866
Of course, I believe you,
but no one else is ever gonna

26:58.933 --> 27:00.133
buy this, it's too far-fetched.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.700
Yeah. You're probably right,
that's why I got get outta--

27:01.766 --> 27:04.300
No, way. The police had the
hospital completely sealed off.

27:04.366 --> 27:06.066
They're even checking
the dead bodies

27:06.133 --> 27:07.366
as they leave the morgue.

27:07.433 --> 27:08.833
There has to be a way.

27:08.900 --> 27:11.166
Oh, even if we can get you
out of the hospital

27:11.233 --> 27:12.866
you're a wanted man,
every cop in the state

27:12.933 --> 27:14.233
will be looking for you.

27:22.166 --> 27:24.133
- I've got an idea.
- What?

27:25.966 --> 27:28.033
I, uh, I spent a year
in Stockholm

27:28.100 --> 27:30.000
learning about an amazing new
form of plastic surgery

27:30.066 --> 27:31.033
called infractive plasti--

27:31.100 --> 27:32.500
Oh, I can already see
where you're goin'.

27:32.566 --> 27:33.933
You can stop right there.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.366
Plastic surgery involves
cutting and scalpels and blood.

27:37.433 --> 27:39.500
Not infractive plastic.
It uses lasers.

27:39.566 --> 27:41.566
They're, it doesn't leave
any scars or bruises

27:41.633 --> 27:43.800
and best of all, it's fast

27:43.866 --> 27:47.066
You want me to let you
cut me with a laser?

27:47.133 --> 27:48.733
No way!

27:49.833 --> 27:51.166
Do you have a better idea?

27:51.233 --> 27:53.166
'Do you find anything?'

27:53.233 --> 27:55.200
'No, not a trace, sarge.'

28:02.933 --> 28:04.500
'We're gonna keep lookin'
till we find him.'

28:04.566 --> 28:06.200
'Alright, you two go
down the left hallway.'

28:06.266 --> 28:08.400
- 'I'll go to the right.'
- Oh, he's gone.

28:14.200 --> 28:16.900
What are you gonna
make me look like?

28:16.966 --> 28:19.200
You mean, you'll let me do it?

28:19.266 --> 28:21.233
Do I have a choice?

28:23.100 --> 28:25.700
Um, here.

28:25.766 --> 28:27.600
Flip through this magazine
and find a-a face you like..

28:27.666 --> 28:29.933
One that matches
your basic facial structure.

28:37.333 --> 28:39.100
Well, what about him?

28:39.166 --> 28:40.300
He's pretty good lookin'.

28:40.366 --> 28:41.800
You kidding?
With that flat nose.

28:41.866 --> 28:44.900
Don't you want a cute nose
like, uh..

28:47.300 --> 28:49.633
...like him,
now

28:52.200 --> 28:53.533
Okay.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.300
Make me look like him.

29:11.233 --> 29:12.866
'What? What-what is it?'

29:12.933 --> 29:16.433
'Is something wrong?
Helen, talk to me.'

29:16.500 --> 29:17.800
I don't know what to say, Derby.

29:17.866 --> 29:22.100
You look.. I don't even,
I can't even put into words.

29:22.166 --> 29:23.633
Here.

29:26.966 --> 29:28.800
What did you do to me, Helen?

29:28.866 --> 29:30.700
I liked your face
the way it was.

29:30.766 --> 29:32.900
It meant more to me that way.

29:33.533 --> 29:35.000
What?

29:35.066 --> 29:37.433
They've put a $20,000
reward on you.

29:40.333 --> 29:43.000
Derby, wake up. It's time
to remove your bandages.

29:46.600 --> 29:48.566
Oh.

29:48.633 --> 29:49.833
I had to tighten
your throat muscles.

29:49.900 --> 29:51.833
Your voice will sound
a little funny for a few weeks.

29:51.900 --> 29:55.800
The question is how do I look?

29:56.600 --> 29:59.000
See for yourself.

29:59.066 --> 30:02.100
Oh. Oh, this is too weird.

30:04.066 --> 30:05.100
Amazing.

30:07.133 --> 30:08.900
You're an artist, Helen.

30:08.966 --> 30:11.200
'No, the big guy upstairs is.'

30:11.266 --> 30:12.933
He made the original face
whosever it was.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.933
I just copied it.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.566
The cops have sealed off
your old room at the hotel

30:36.633 --> 30:39.366
so I checked you into a new one
under the name Bryan Johnson.

30:39.433 --> 30:41.100
- Now, who is that?
- It's someone I made up.

30:41.166 --> 30:42.900
It's room 2-6-7.

30:42.966 --> 30:44.600
So go on over there and
I'll be over as soon as I can.

30:44.666 --> 30:46.500
Hey, hey, hey, Helen.

30:46.566 --> 30:48.133
I love you.

30:49.433 --> 30:50.633
Me too.

31:03.966 --> 31:05.566
'I'll see your hundred..'

31:05.633 --> 31:07.600
'...and I raise you a hundred.'

31:09.233 --> 31:10.600
'Call.'

31:12.000 --> 31:14.500
Aces over queens.

31:17.666 --> 31:19.466
You guys wanna play for money?

31:19.533 --> 31:20.700
No, thanks.

31:20.766 --> 31:22.466
You won every hand
for the past hour.

31:22.533 --> 31:24.966
Somehow, I don't think
that's gonna change.

31:25.033 --> 31:26.500
What are you sayin', I cheat?

31:26.566 --> 31:30.900
No. You just get perfect cards
'cause you're lucky.

31:30.966 --> 31:32.233
Hey.

31:32.300 --> 31:34.400
Vinnie Santorro
is an honest man.

31:34.466 --> 31:37.866
I don't lie, I don't cheat,
and I don't steal.

31:37.933 --> 31:40.100
'Nah, you just kill people
for a living.'

31:40.166 --> 31:43.333
Hey, I used to kill people
for a living.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.533
Now, I'm reformed. Ha ha ha.

31:45.600 --> 31:48.566
Five days I've had to listen
to this motor-mouth scumbag.

31:48.633 --> 31:50.266
Hey, look, five days
in here ain't exactly

31:50.333 --> 31:52.066
been a picnic with you, neither.

31:52.133 --> 31:54.333
It stinks in here.

31:54.400 --> 31:55.933
Why can't we get us
some maid service?

31:56.000 --> 31:57.733
You know why we can't.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.433
Oh, oh, what, are your afraid

31:59.500 --> 32:01.666
somebody's gonna come in here
and blow me away?

32:01.733 --> 32:04.966
We have to cover every angle.

32:05.033 --> 32:06.833
Been a hired gun long enough
to know all the plays.

32:06.900 --> 32:08.566
If the maid's on the payroll.
I'll recognize her.

32:08.633 --> 32:10.633
So, can we get some
clean up in here?

32:13.733 --> 32:15.700
What the hell.

32:17.433 --> 32:19.833
Where are those damn guys
with the pizza.

32:22.433 --> 32:25.866
Yeah, this is Detective
Seiberling in room 265.

32:25.933 --> 32:27.600
Could we get some
maid service in here?

32:27.666 --> 32:29.433
Thank you very much.

32:29.500 --> 32:31.333
Thanks.

32:36.366 --> 32:38.633
I hope you're wrong
and she blows you away.

32:38.700 --> 32:40.833
Yeah, well, she won't.

32:40.900 --> 32:43.600
But don't worry,
somebody else will.

32:43.666 --> 32:45.466
I bet they got two, three guys
in this building right now

32:45.533 --> 32:47.933
waiting for
the right opportunity.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.200
Oh, geez, I hope to hell
it ain't Marco.

32:50.266 --> 32:52.366
'Why, is he good?'

32:52.433 --> 32:54.433
Marco's a moron.

32:54.500 --> 32:55.533
Couldn't hit the side of a barn

32:55.600 --> 32:58.300
if he had his gun up
against the wall.

32:58.366 --> 33:00.933
Probably shoot me in the crotch
before he finally did kill me.

33:01.766 --> 33:03.300
I hope they send Marco.

34:36.633 --> 34:38.300
About time you guys got here.

34:38.366 --> 34:40.533
We're starving.

34:48.333 --> 34:51.766
Helen, does anyone else know
about the plastic surgery?

34:51.833 --> 34:54.766
- Any of Dr. Crowley's friends?
- Why?

34:54.833 --> 34:57.300
Because somebody's tryin'
to kill me, that's why.

34:57.366 --> 34:59.266
I was afraid something
like that might happen.

34:59.333 --> 35:00.833
Why?

35:00.900 --> 35:03.233
We were in such a rush that
we picked your face too hastily.

35:03.300 --> 35:04.300
We should have read the article

35:04.366 --> 35:06.033
that went along
with the photograph.

35:06.100 --> 35:07.466
What does it say?

35:07.533 --> 35:08.700
It said that your face belongs

35:08.766 --> 35:10.533
to a man named Vincent Santorro.

35:10.600 --> 35:13.233
He's an organized crime hitman

35:13.300 --> 35:15.633
who just turned
state's evidence.

35:15.700 --> 35:18.100
Oh, great. I'm dead.

35:18.166 --> 35:19.833
'Oh, Derby, calm down,
you're not dead.'

35:19.900 --> 35:22.133
Oh, yeah? Have you seen
"The Godfather"?

35:22.200 --> 35:23.800
'Those guys are mean.'

35:23.866 --> 35:26.666
Derby, do not let your
imagination go wild with you.

35:26.733 --> 35:28.100
They put a bloody
horse's head in bed

35:28.166 --> 35:29.533
with a guy just before
they killed him.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.500
'That is not what happened
in the film, Derby.'

35:31.566 --> 35:33.333
And then a bunch of guys
with machine guns

35:33.400 --> 35:35.800
they shot bullets into another
guy for about ten minutes.

35:35.866 --> 35:38.433
Listen to me. Stay in your room
and try to relax.

35:38.500 --> 35:41.333
I'm on my way over and we'll
figure something out, okay?

36:12.400 --> 36:13.966
You even cheat at solitaire.

36:22.333 --> 36:24.433
- Yeah?
- 'Maid.'

36:26.466 --> 36:28.433
Keep your hands
where we can see 'em.

36:30.566 --> 36:33.400
What is this, "Miami Vice?"

36:33.466 --> 36:34.866
Somethin' like that.

36:34.933 --> 36:37.100
Want to to step away
from the cart, please?

36:39.633 --> 36:41.800
Sorry, ma'am,
gonna have to frisk you.

36:42.666 --> 36:44.733
Be my guest, officer.

36:46.466 --> 36:48.300
No, that won't be necessary.

36:48.366 --> 36:50.333
Go ahead and clean.

37:41.100 --> 37:43.100
Helen?

37:43.166 --> 37:45.833
It's about time you got here.

37:47.100 --> 37:49.600
- How'd you do that?
- Do what?

37:49.666 --> 37:52.400
You were right across
the hall ten seconds ago.

37:52.466 --> 37:53.466
No, I wasn't.

37:53.533 --> 37:55.266
You pullin' my leg
or something?

37:55.333 --> 37:56.966
No.

37:57.033 --> 37:59.633
I could swear I just saw a guy

37:59.700 --> 38:02.500
across the hall that's
the spittin' image of you.

38:05.833 --> 38:07.800
Right across the hall?

38:13.466 --> 38:15.066
Come on, Helen, where are you?

39:10.366 --> 39:12.400
- Who is it?
- 'It's me.'

39:25.466 --> 39:27.100
Thank God.

39:40.766 --> 39:43.600
- Are you okay?
- Oh. No.

39:43.666 --> 39:45.300
That Vinnie Santorro guy

39:45.366 --> 39:47.066
he's in a room across the hall.

39:47.133 --> 39:48.700
Are you sure? Did you see him?

39:48.766 --> 39:50.666
No, no. The maid told me.

39:50.733 --> 39:52.633
I wouldn't have even let her in
expect I thought it was you.

39:52.700 --> 39:54.300
You had to pick this face.

39:54.366 --> 39:56.100
You and your smart ideas.

39:56.166 --> 39:58.666
I was just trying to help.

39:58.733 --> 40:00.700
Oh, I know, I'm sorry.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.300
So, what do we do now?

40:06.600 --> 40:08.966
What else did the maid tell you?

40:09.033 --> 40:11.433
Well, that there are two cops
guarding him. Why?

40:13.166 --> 40:14.700
Because if the guys
across the hall

40:14.766 --> 40:17.033
who're trying to kill
Mr. Santorro succeed

40:17.100 --> 40:19.933
then all your,
your problems are over.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.100
Everyone will think he's dead

40:21.166 --> 40:23.133
and no one will be
looking for him.

40:23.200 --> 40:25.133
Wait a minute.

40:26.700 --> 40:29.033
Are you suggesting
that we kill the guy?

40:29.100 --> 40:32.200
No, I'm suggesting that
we help the pros do it.

40:32.266 --> 40:34.500
I mean, he's a killer, right?

40:34.566 --> 40:36.533
He's probably got it coming.

40:46.300 --> 40:47.533
Yeah.

40:47.600 --> 40:49.433
'Yes, officer,
this is the front desk.'

40:49.500 --> 40:50.633
I just thought
you might wanna know

40:50.700 --> 40:53.166
there's a man down here
who's sort of hanging out.

40:53.233 --> 40:56.100
One of our bell captains
noticed a gun under his coat.

40:56.166 --> 40:57.466
Thank you.
You did the right thing.

40:57.533 --> 40:59.500
I'll come down and check it out.

41:01.266 --> 41:03.933
Sounds like one
of Vinnie's pals is downstairs.

41:05.066 --> 41:07.500
I'm gonna check it out.
You stay with dirtbag.

41:07.566 --> 41:08.633
Right.

41:13.733 --> 41:14.966
Hey, hey. They bought it.

41:15.033 --> 41:16.166
One of 'em just left the room.

41:16.233 --> 41:18.233
Good. Now, for number two.

41:27.300 --> 41:28.733
You stay down.

41:56.100 --> 41:57.300
Derby, you're up.

41:58.566 --> 42:00.100
Lord, do I have to?

42:00.166 --> 42:02.433
Yes. And you have about
five minutes, so go.

42:20.566 --> 42:22.200
Hey.

42:22.266 --> 42:24.433
Who are you?

42:26.933 --> 42:28.033
I, uh..

42:29.100 --> 42:30.700
Listen, I'm, uh..

42:32.033 --> 42:34.000
I'm really sorry.

42:44.566 --> 42:46.300
Marco.

42:46.366 --> 42:47.533
Marco.

42:48.966 --> 42:50.800
I could have sworn you was
wearin' somethin' different

42:50.866 --> 42:52.900
a second ago.

42:52.966 --> 42:54.700
Well, yeah, I was.

42:54.766 --> 42:56.300
I mean he was.

42:56.366 --> 42:57.433
You see that wasn't me.
That was some guy.

42:57.500 --> 42:59.000
He's just come
through the door..

42:59.066 --> 43:01.233
Hey, save it, Vinnie.

43:01.300 --> 43:03.366
You know, I may be dumb.

43:03.433 --> 43:05.100
But I'm not stupid.

43:05.166 --> 43:06.666
You know what I mean?

43:06.733 --> 43:09.100
Sure, sure.

43:09.166 --> 43:11.500
Yeah, yeah.

43:11.566 --> 43:15.133
You're smart. That's why
you're gonna listen to me.

43:15.200 --> 43:16.366
Uh-uh.

43:16.433 --> 43:18.600
You taught me
better than that, Vinnie.

43:19.300 --> 43:20.666
Come on, Marco.

43:20.733 --> 43:23.133
Hey, we're friends.

43:24.133 --> 43:25.533
We are?

43:25.600 --> 43:27.233
We are!

43:27.300 --> 43:29.266
Hey, that's nice.

43:29.333 --> 43:32.433
You know, I always wanted
to be your friend.

43:32.500 --> 43:34.266
I still gotta kill you though.

43:34.333 --> 43:36.733
I ain't got no choice, Vinnie.

43:36.800 --> 43:38.733
Sure, sure you do, Marco.

43:40.066 --> 43:42.933
Hey, you can turn
state's evidence with me.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.333
'Yeah. Yeah, yeah.'

43:44.400 --> 43:46.100
'We'll get you a nice deal.'

43:46.166 --> 43:48.700
Sorry, Vinnie,
I don't know nothin'.

43:48.766 --> 43:50.900
I ain't no snitch like you.

43:50.966 --> 43:53.433
Hey, don't try, Vinnie.

43:53.500 --> 43:55.433
Stop right there.

43:57.600 --> 43:59.333
Don't worry, I'll try to make it

43:59.400 --> 44:01.600
as painless as possible,
alright?

44:01.666 --> 44:03.533
Oh, no.

44:06.800 --> 44:07.933
Aah!

44:09.000 --> 44:10.433
Damn.

44:12.400 --> 44:13.733

44:15.766 --> 44:18.333
Marco, if you're gonna kill me

44:18.400 --> 44:19.600

44:19.666 --> 44:21.700
What do you think
I'm tryin' to do here?

44:37.000 --> 44:39.900
Plastic surgery.

44:39.966 --> 44:41.633
Should I get some?

44:41.700 --> 44:43.500
Nah.

44:43.566 --> 44:45.700
Why mess with perfection?
