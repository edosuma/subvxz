01:47.750 --> 01:50.218
Think you'll be okay
waiting here by yourself?

01:51.587 --> 01:53.988
Yeah. Whatever.

01:55.491 --> 01:57.558
Uh, sir,
if you'd like to smoke,

01:57.593 --> 02:00.027
you need to be another
20 feet from the door.

02:00.062 --> 02:02.163
So roll me further, bitch.

[ambulance siren in distance]

02:24.086 --> 02:25.386
What's coming?

02:25.420 --> 02:26.721
Male Caucasian.

02:26.755 --> 02:27.955
Early 40s.

02:27.990 --> 02:29.524
Multiple gunshot wounds.

02:32.928 --> 02:35.830
BP is 70. 7-0 over palp.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.232
Pulse 140-- 1-4-0.

02:38.267 --> 02:39.634
Weak and thready
at the brachial.

02:39.668 --> 02:41.102
No breath sounds
on the right side,

02:41.136 --> 02:42.236
and the belly is rigid.

02:42.271 --> 02:44.005
Patient appears pale
and diaphoretic.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.606
How many entry wounds?

02:45.641 --> 02:47.375
We found four-- shoulder and
hip, through and through.

02:47.409 --> 02:49.443
Right lung
and lower left quadrant,

02:49.478 --> 02:51.445
no visible exit wounds.

02:51.480 --> 02:53.147
Let's give him
2 grams of oxygen.

02:53.182 --> 02:55.383
What's his hemoglobin?
7.3.

02:55.417 --> 02:57.685
I need two

Damn, brother, look at you.

03:47.035 --> 03:49.136
That's messed up.

03:49.171 --> 03:52.173
How are you feeling?
You okay?

03:52.207 --> 03:53.574
Actually...

03:55.644 --> 03:57.678

[Gale] I don't understand.

04:22.905 --> 04:25.406
I thought things were
going pretty well.

04:25.440 --> 04:27.108
I--

04:27.142 --> 04:29.277
I thought we were
kind of simpatico,

04:29.311 --> 04:30.544
you know?

04:30.579 --> 04:33.247
We were becoming a real team.

04:33.282 --> 04:37.785
Uh, not-- not so much, no.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.021
Is this about the temperature
setting the other day?

04:40.055 --> 04:42.490
Because I can assure you
that will not happen--

04:42.524 --> 04:44.358
No, it's bigger
than that, Gale.

04:44.393 --> 04:48.296
It's-- It's-- It's
much more than that.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.264
Could you elaborate?

04:50.299 --> 04:53.167
Well, uh, yes,
of course I could,

04:53.201 --> 04:56.170
but I don't think either of us

04:56.204 --> 04:59.874
would necessarily benefit
from a prolonged...

05:01.009 --> 05:03.978
Uh, yeah, so...

05:04.012 --> 05:05.646
Yeah.

05:05.681 --> 05:08.316
I set up the entire lab.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.785
You said you liked
the configuration.

05:10.819 --> 05:12.720
And I do.

05:12.754 --> 05:14.822
For the most part.

05:14.856 --> 05:18.526
Look, you're a fine
chemist, really,

05:18.560 --> 05:20.227
with a promising future.

05:20.262 --> 05:23.264
It's just that--
that I--

05:23.298 --> 05:28.636
that-- that we just have
different...

05:28.670 --> 05:30.871
Rhythms, Gale.

05:30.906 --> 05:31.973
It's-- It's--

05:32.007 --> 05:36.711
It's as if I'm classical

05:40.716 --> 05:42.616

Jazz.

05:45.287 --> 05:46.420
Yes.

05:46.455 --> 05:49.323
And God knows there is
nothing wrong with jazz.

05:49.358 --> 05:55.062
It's simply
that I require--

05:55.097 --> 05:56.197

Exactly.

05:59.401 --> 06:02.169
Oh, shit.

06:02.204 --> 06:04.605
Man, this is the bomb.

06:12.381 --> 06:14.615
What's up, partner?

06:16.818 --> 06:18.586
[Jesse] Ohh.

06:18.620 --> 06:20.221
I can't believe this.
This is my replacement?

06:20.255 --> 06:22.590
[Jesse] Oh, Jesus.

06:22.624 --> 06:25.960
Hi. Gale. Nice to meet you.

06:25.994 --> 06:27.528
What's up?

06:27.562 --> 06:30.197
Damn, we should have
ditched that RV months ago.

06:30.232 --> 06:32.867
It's all, like,
shining up in here.

06:34.202 --> 06:35.736
Oh!

06:35.771 --> 06:36.804
[Jesse chuckles]

06:36.838 --> 06:38.139
I'm sorry. I must be
missing something.

I don't mean to be--

Oh! Oh!

06:41.943 --> 06:44.178

06:44.212 --> 06:47.114
...makes no sense.

06:54.156 --> 06:56.690
So...

Oh, dear mother of God.

Wow.

07:31.193 --> 07:33.327

07:33.361 --> 07:35.696
Okay. There's a lot
to show you.

07:35.730 --> 07:37.965
Some new techniques to learn.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.267
What, now?

07:40.302 --> 07:41.902
Yes, now.

07:41.937 --> 07:43.370
We've only got a couple days

07:43.405 --> 07:45.339
before our next batch is due,

07:45.373 --> 07:48.075
and I need to get you
up to speed.

07:48.110 --> 07:49.677
Right on.

07:49.711 --> 07:51.479
I'm just saying--

07:53.849 --> 07:55.950
How's the cell service
down here?

07:55.984 --> 07:57.785
It's nonexistent.

07:57.819 --> 07:59.386
We're shielded.

07:59.421 --> 08:01.922
There's a hard line
for emergencies. Come on.

08:01.957 --> 08:04.458
So you haven't talked
to anybody today

08:04.493 --> 08:07.094
other than, you know,
Captain Nerd there.

08:07.129 --> 08:09.396
Why?

08:09.431 --> 08:12.233
Your brother-in-law.

08:12.267 --> 08:14.635
What about him?

08:17.839 --> 08:19.607
So what's the story?
Upon arrival, he was unresponsive.

08:19.641 --> 08:21.442
Take a look. You getting some
exposure on those wounds?

08:21.476 --> 08:22.476
...blood pressure of 80.

08:22.511 --> 08:23.744
2 units of normal saline.

08:23.778 --> 08:25.012
We've got a bivalve mass.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.213
He's got breath sounds
bilaterally.

08:26.248 --> 08:27.848
This femur feels
like a wet bag of gravel.

08:27.883 --> 08:29.350
The other one's
not much better.

08:29.384 --> 08:30.518
Let's get those boots off.

08:30.552 --> 08:31.519
See if you get a pulse.

08:31.553 --> 08:33.754
You get a blood pressure
cup or an ABI?

08:33.788 --> 08:35.089
Where's that blood?

08:40.729 --> 08:42.328
Sir, can I help you?

08:42.364 --> 08:43.429
Uh, yeah, I--

08:43.465 --> 08:44.732
It's all right.
He's family.

08:44.766 --> 08:45.766
Thank you.

08:46.768 --> 08:47.835
Marie.

08:47.869 --> 08:50.137
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

08:50.172 --> 08:51.205
Hey.

08:56.545 --> 08:57.811
I'm so sorry.

08:57.846 --> 08:59.980
I don't know what to say.

09:07.622 --> 09:08.923
How is he?

09:08.957 --> 09:10.891
I don't know. They won't
really tell us anything.

09:10.926 --> 09:12.726
He's still in surgery.

09:14.062 --> 09:16.030
They shot him four times.

09:17.832 --> 09:19.066
Oh, Christ.

09:24.172 --> 09:25.573
Where's Holly?

09:25.607 --> 09:27.408
I got a sitter.

09:28.944 --> 09:31.779
Hey. How are you, huh?

09:31.813 --> 09:33.914
Fine.
Yeah?

09:35.450 --> 09:36.584
Sure?

09:37.919 --> 09:40.754
I-- I'm fine. I just need
some fresh air.

09:42.924 --> 09:44.825
Okay.

09:44.859 --> 09:46.160
Here.
Let me get the door.

09:46.194 --> 09:48.929
I got it. I'm fine.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.867
Walt.
Hmm?

09:53.902 --> 09:56.237
Walt, this is ASAC Merkert.

09:56.271 --> 09:57.738
Hank's
brother-in-law Walt.

09:57.772 --> 09:59.106
Hello.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.140
I'm very sorry.

10:00.175 --> 10:01.208
Thank you. Uh--

10:01.243 --> 10:02.977
Can you tell us anything

10:03.011 --> 10:04.912
or any details?

10:04.946 --> 10:06.146
Right now, all we know

10:06.181 --> 10:07.681
is two men ambushed Hank.

10:07.716 --> 10:09.583
They didn't have any I.D.
on them.

10:09.618 --> 10:10.918
Probably Mexican nationals.

10:10.952 --> 10:13.854
Their tattoos
indicated an affiliation

10:13.888 --> 10:15.556
with the drug cartel.

10:17.492 --> 10:19.893
Why did they attack Hank?

10:19.928 --> 10:21.562
We're not sure yet.

10:21.596 --> 10:24.098
It could be in relation

10:24.132 --> 10:26.000
to an investigation
that Hank was working,

10:26.034 --> 10:29.870
or it could be a message
to the DEA in general.

10:32.641 --> 10:34.241
They had an ax.

10:34.276 --> 10:38.045
The cartels tend
to be dramatic.

10:39.314 --> 10:40.714
Oh, Jesus.

10:42.784 --> 10:44.918
Where are they?
I mean, did they--

10:44.953 --> 10:46.620
Hank got both of them.

10:46.655 --> 10:48.289
He killed one outright,

10:48.323 --> 10:49.890
and the other one's upstairs

10:49.924 --> 10:51.058
in critical condition.

10:51.092 --> 10:53.060
Your brother-in-law's
one tough son of a bitch

10:53.094 --> 10:54.461
to take them both out,

10:54.496 --> 10:56.730
considering he didn't
even have his gun.

10:59.768 --> 11:01.669
He didn't have his gun?

11:05.974 --> 11:08.976
Why didn't Hank have his gun?

11:09.978 --> 11:12.246
Marie, the assault charge.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.449
I had to suspend Hank
pending the investigation.

11:15.483 --> 11:18.819
That means I had to
take away his weapon.

11:18.853 --> 11:20.154
[muttering]

11:20.188 --> 11:21.922
It's standard procedure.
No one--

11:21.956 --> 11:23.290
Okay, All right. Listen.

11:23.325 --> 11:25.192
If you would have all
listened to him

11:25.226 --> 11:26.360
right from the start,

11:26.394 --> 11:28.295
and let him arrest
that little degenerate,

11:28.330 --> 11:31.165
he wouldn't have had to take
things into his own hands,

11:31.199 --> 11:33.434
and he would have had a gun
and defended himself.

11:33.468 --> 11:34.601
Marie,
let's just--

11:34.636 --> 11:35.636
No. Just--

11:37.872 --> 11:39.673
It's their fault.

11:39.708 --> 11:42.209
He didn't have a gun.

11:42.243 --> 11:44.311
Honey, this isn't helping you.

11:44.346 --> 11:46.180
You.

11:46.214 --> 11:48.782
What kind of partner are you?

11:50.685 --> 11:52.586
You were supposed
to back him up,

11:52.620 --> 11:54.054
and where were you?

11:54.089 --> 11:56.090
Where were you?

11:56.124 --> 11:57.791
Texas.

11:59.361 --> 12:01.495
And you.

12:01.529 --> 12:04.832
You're supposed to
protect your agents

12:04.866 --> 12:07.201
instead of taking their guns,

12:07.235 --> 12:08.635
not supporting them,

12:08.670 --> 12:10.037
not backing them up--

12:10.071 --> 12:11.705
Marie. Marie.
...when they--

12:11.740 --> 12:16.777
Honey, let's just go
and sit down, okay?

12:16.811 --> 12:18.145
I'm not doing anything

12:18.179 --> 12:20.381
until these two get
the hell out of here.

12:20.415 --> 12:21.515
I mean it.

12:27.389 --> 12:28.889
Sorry--
Go.

12:28.923 --> 12:31.158
You are not welcome here.

12:31.192 --> 12:34.061
The DEA is not welcome here.

12:34.095 --> 12:35.429
Honey.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.830
Come on.

12:36.865 --> 12:38.766
Come on. Let's go sit down.

12:51.813 --> 12:53.447
It's not just them.

12:55.216 --> 12:57.518
It's you, Walt.

13:03.958 --> 13:08.962
This Pinkman that Hank
was looking for--

13:08.997 --> 13:12.099
Hank would have never
even heard his name

13:12.133 --> 13:15.936
if you hadn't bought
marijuana from him.

13:15.970 --> 13:17.004
Marie--

13:17.038 --> 13:19.106
Do you ever think
about that, Walt?

13:19.140 --> 13:21.008
Do you?

13:21.042 --> 13:23.310
Do you ever think
about everything

13:23.344 --> 13:24.812
that you have put him through?

13:24.846 --> 13:26.079
[Skyler] Marie, stop.

13:26.114 --> 13:28.682
You're upset,

13:28.716 --> 13:30.083
and you're looking
for someone to blame,

13:30.118 --> 13:32.719
and it's understandable,
but don't blame Walt.

13:32.754 --> 13:34.822
It's not his fault.

13:42.464 --> 13:43.530
I'm sorry.

went straight to voice mail.

18:44.449 --> 18:46.450
maybe we should go get
everybody some breakfast.

18:46.484 --> 18:48.319
Yeah. That sounds good.

18:48.353 --> 18:50.154
Do you know who that was?

19:05.070 --> 19:10.574
You know, these eggs
are really not too bad.

19:24.155 --> 19:25.122
Look at that.

19:25.156 --> 19:26.490
Look at what?

19:26.524 --> 19:29.827
At what? This. These spots.

19:29.861 --> 19:32.696
This fork is absolutely filthy.

19:37.102 --> 19:38.836
Tell me you see this.

19:38.870 --> 19:40.571
You've got good eyes.
Look at that.

19:40.605 --> 19:43.440
Marie, those
are just water spots.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.008
Fork is fine.

19:45.043 --> 19:47.611
Those are not water spots.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.980
That's dirt.

19:50.014 --> 19:53.650
This silverware's
obviously not been cleaned.

19:53.685 --> 19:56.920
It's covered in germs
from someone else's mouth.

19:56.955 --> 19:58.956
God knows what.

19:58.990 --> 20:03.360
Seriously, Aunt Marie,
it's water spots.

20:03.395 --> 20:06.597
Ours at home aren't any better.

20:06.631 --> 20:08.399
Yours at home are irrelevant.

20:08.433 --> 20:09.933
We're in a hospital.

20:09.968 --> 20:12.035
They need to be held
to a higher standard.

20:12.070 --> 20:13.337
They have a responsibility.

20:13.371 --> 20:15.172
Well, I'm not actually sure

20:15.206 --> 20:17.775
if the cafeteria
necessarily qualifies

20:17.809 --> 20:19.076
as being part of a hospital.

20:19.110 --> 20:20.911
It's in the same building.

20:20.945 --> 20:22.279
It's all under the same roof.

20:22.313 --> 20:24.748
Do you think that sick
people aren't eating

20:24.783 --> 20:26.950
with this bacteria-infected
silverware?

20:26.985 --> 20:29.820
My Gpd, how are you supposed
to survive this death trap?

20:33.057 --> 20:34.324
[Skyler] Marie.

20:37.662 --> 20:39.296
I survived.

20:40.665 --> 20:43.367
I had my lumpectomy
at this hospital.

20:43.401 --> 20:44.568
Remember that?

20:46.037 --> 20:48.172
Remember how scared
we all were?

20:48.206 --> 20:49.306
Whoo.

20:49.340 --> 20:51.442
I didn't want to act like it,

20:51.476 --> 20:54.945
but I was terrified.

20:54.979 --> 20:57.981
All that week,
all I could think of

20:58.016 --> 21:02.820
was how they were actually
going to cut me open

21:02.854 --> 21:06.523
and take out a part of me

21:06.558 --> 21:09.326
that was with me
my entire life.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.728
I couldn't get that image
out of my head.

21:13.698 --> 21:16.066
I think the scariest part

21:16.100 --> 21:18.168
was when...

21:18.203 --> 21:20.571
They took me into pre-op,

21:20.605 --> 21:23.640
lying there,

21:23.675 --> 21:26.076
waiting for them
to anesthetize you,

21:26.110 --> 21:29.112
knowing that...

21:29.147 --> 21:30.981
You may never wake up again.

21:36.588 --> 21:39.590
[chuckles] Actually,

21:39.624 --> 21:42.659
what I really remember
about that day

21:42.694 --> 21:45.195
is driving to the hospital.

21:45.230 --> 21:48.298
Skyler, you remember me
wanting to drive that day?

21:48.333 --> 21:50.501
Yeah.

21:50.535 --> 21:54.638
Anyway, there we are.
We're driving up Central,

21:54.672 --> 21:58.008
and we hit every green light--

21:58.042 --> 22:00.711
I mean, every single light
that we hit--

22:00.745 --> 22:03.313
sheew-- green.

22:03.348 --> 22:05.382
[chuckling]

22:05.416 --> 22:06.817
When does that happen?

22:08.186 --> 22:11.154
Just like bang, bang,

22:11.189 --> 22:13.524
green the entire way.

22:13.558 --> 22:16.326
And the whole time,
all I could think about

22:16.361 --> 22:20.764
was "Why today? Why?

22:20.798 --> 22:24.768
"Why can't I just spend
a few extra minutes

22:24.802 --> 22:26.637
in the car with my family?"

22:28.740 --> 22:32.743
I never wanted to be stuck
in traffic so bad in my life.

22:34.078 --> 22:36.580
At least I was with my family.

22:39.317 --> 22:40.951
I had that.

22:45.823 --> 22:50.227
Anyway, I survived this place.

22:51.663 --> 22:54.898
And I'm not half the man
your husband is.

23:17.155 --> 23:19.022

23:24.095 --> 23:26.430
<i>[Man speaking Spanish]</i>

23:26.464 --> 23:28.632
I was going to ask you
the same question.

23:31.002 --> 23:32.936
<i>I heard they they
attacked a DEA agent.</i>

23:32.971 --> 23:34.204
<i>Why would they do that?</i>

23:40.011 --> 23:41.545
I didn't order this,

23:41.579 --> 23:43.714
and my men would never
do this on their own.

23:43.748 --> 23:46.350
Someone gave the go-ahead.

23:46.384 --> 23:49.052
<i>Are you
accusing me?</i>

23:49.087 --> 23:52.322
I'm just saying they
wouldn't act on their own.

23:52.357 --> 23:55.559
I am not in the habit
of picking my own pocket.

23:55.593 --> 23:57.327
I assume

23:57.362 --> 23:59.363
<i>that the next shipment
will be delayed.</i>

23:59.397 --> 24:01.331
<i>Any thoughts on when
it might arrive?</i>

24:01.366 --> 24:03.367
A week, a month.

24:03.401 --> 24:05.268
There's too much
focus on the border.

24:05.303 --> 24:07.337
We lay low for the time being.

24:07.372 --> 24:08.772
We lay low,

24:08.806 --> 24:11.308
and then we get the real story
from my man who survived.

24:11.342 --> 24:13.844
Your man is in custody.

24:15.880 --> 24:17.180
He's innocent

24:17.215 --> 24:18.248
Correct?

24:18.282 --> 24:20.283
I'll get him the best lawyer,

24:20.318 --> 24:22.586
<i>and then
we'll learn the truth.</i>

24:22.620 --> 24:24.588
Well, keep me apprised.

24:28.793 --> 24:31.695
Any time you've got that close
proximity to the spine,

24:31.729 --> 24:33.363
there's always going
to be cause for concern,

24:33.398 --> 24:35.032
but, as I say,

24:35.066 --> 24:36.700
it's really too soon to tell.

24:36.734 --> 24:39.603
He's out of surgery,
at least, which is--

24:39.637 --> 24:41.872
Out of surgery,
on his way to revery.

24:41.906 --> 24:43.473
All right.
Where's that?

24:43.508 --> 24:45.342
Unfortunately,
you can't see him just yet.

24:45.376 --> 24:47.644
We're gonna have to wait
for him to stabilize.

24:48.746 --> 24:49.946
How long will that take?

24:49.981 --> 24:51.748

30:27.507 --> 30:30.275
<i>Walter White to the nearest
courtesy phone.</i>

30:30.309 --> 30:32.811
<i>Operator.
This is Walter White.</i>

30:32.845 --> 30:34.446
<i>I'll connect you.</i>

30:36.049 --> 30:37.916
[beep]

30:37.950 --> 30:40.886
<i>[Jesse] Yo, we got
problems, big ones.</i>

30:40.920 --> 30:43.455
Reverend,
so nice of you to call...

30:43.489 --> 30:44.690
Again.

30:44.724 --> 30:46.258
Turn your phone on already.

30:46.292 --> 30:49.494
<i>You know, I will
definitely look into that.</i>

30:49.529 --> 30:53.699
I'll tell you what. Why don't I just
call you right back on my cell phone.

30:53.733 --> 30:55.167
Okay?

30:57.370 --> 30:58.770
I told you to wait.

30:58.805 --> 31:00.772
I don't know how many
more ways I could say it.

31:00.807 --> 31:02.741
<i>Yeah, damn, I was waiting,</i>

31:02.775 --> 31:05.644
<i>and then that creepy,
quiet guy showed up.</i>

31:05.678 --> 31:07.479
Gus came by?

31:07.513 --> 31:08.914
Not him, man.

31:08.948 --> 31:11.016
Apparently I'm not worthy
of meeting him.

31:11.050 --> 31:13.952
It was the other one, the one
that I'm qualified to speak to.

31:13.986 --> 31:15.554
Then he started asking
questions, too,

31:15.588 --> 31:17.989
<i>like why
I haven't cooked anything.</i>

31:18.024 --> 31:19.591
<i>We have a quota.</i>

31:19.625 --> 31:21.660
It's due tomorrow.

31:21.694 --> 31:23.495
Do you seriously not care,
or what?

31:23.529 --> 31:26.732
<i>Because that guy, he's got,
like, the dead eyes.</i>

31:26.766 --> 31:28.133
Let me ask you something.

31:28.167 --> 31:30.969
Do you remember when we were
out in the desert with Tuco?

31:31.003 --> 31:34.306
Oh, you mean when he put
a machinegun to my head?

31:34.340 --> 31:37.275
Yeah, I think that does ring
a tiny bell. Why?

31:37.310 --> 31:39.277
No. He kept-- He kept saying

31:39.312 --> 31:41.546
that-- that someone

31:41.581 --> 31:43.782
was coming up
from Mexico to get us.

31:43.816 --> 31:46.284
Do you remember?
Now, who was that?

31:46.319 --> 31:48.120
<i>What the hell has
this even got to do with--</i>

31:48.154 --> 31:51.022
Look, I don't know.
It was, um--

31:51.057 --> 31:53.225
<i>uh...</i>

31:53.259 --> 31:55.994
His cousins.

31:56.028 --> 31:59.464
Right, Jesse?
It was his cousins.

31:59.499 --> 32:02.033
Yeah, cousins.

32:02.068 --> 32:03.735
Whatever, man. Why?

32:22.755 --> 32:24.489
Any news?

32:24.524 --> 32:25.957
[Marie] No change.

32:28.494 --> 32:31.897
Okay. Well, I--

32:31.931 --> 32:34.766
I didn't know whose
toothbrushes were whose, so I--

32:34.801 --> 32:37.869
I just stopped
by the drugstore.

32:37.904 --> 32:41.540
Thank God
for travel sizes, right?

32:42.775 --> 32:44.342
Thank you.
Yeah.

32:48.748 --> 32:51.049
Oh, I think I'm going
to go wash my face.

32:51.083 --> 32:54.586
I'm going crazy.

32:54.620 --> 32:56.188
Do you want to come?

32:56.222 --> 32:58.323
Yeah.

33:13.973 --> 33:15.674
I got candy bars.

33:17.243 --> 33:18.577
Oh, um--

33:20.012 --> 33:22.781
Is this what
you were asking for?

33:22.815 --> 33:24.983
Yeah.
Yeah?

33:25.017 --> 33:28.353
Yeah, I--
I skimmed through it.

33:28.387 --> 33:29.721
Looks interesting.

33:29.755 --> 33:30.922
Yeah.

33:30.957 --> 33:34.292
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

33:38.197 --> 33:39.831
What's it about?

33:42.034 --> 33:44.402
Pablo Escobar,

33:44.437 --> 33:46.905
this big drug guy in the '80s.

33:48.207 --> 33:51.142
Yeah. Yeah, I remember
seeing him on the news.

33:51.177 --> 33:56.314
Well, it's more about
the guys who investigated him

33:56.349 --> 33:59.017
and tried to bring him down.

33:59.051 --> 34:02.120
Some of them were DEA,
you know?

34:02.154 --> 34:07.559
Uncle Hank said that they
were worth learning about,

34:07.593 --> 34:10.862
that everybody knows
who Pablo Escobar is,

34:10.897 --> 34:13.831
but nobody knows about the guys
that brought him down.

34:16.168 --> 34:18.303
I guess I never thought
about it.

34:20.438 --> 34:21.606
[chuckles]

34:21.641 --> 34:25.476
He said that good guys

34:25.511 --> 34:27.779
never get ink
like the bad guys do.

34:35.154 --> 34:36.855
[chuckles]

34:36.889 --> 34:39.824
So he gave it to me.

34:39.859 --> 34:41.826
Figured I'd read it.

34:45.164 --> 34:46.731
[cell phone ringing]

34:56.242 --> 34:58.810
Uh, I-- I need to--

34:58.844 --> 35:00.779
I'll be right back, okay?

35:07.386 --> 35:10.155
No, I assure you.
We are hard at work.

35:10.189 --> 35:12.357
Absolutely.

35:12.391 --> 35:16.428
<i>[Gus] So I can expect delivery
by tomorrow as scheduled.</i>

35:16.462 --> 35:18.763
Well, uh--

35:18.798 --> 35:20.532
No. Unfortunately--

35:20.566 --> 35:24.336
<i>Unfortunately,
we're not going to be able</i>

35:24.370 --> 35:26.571
to keep our schedule this week.

35:26.605 --> 35:29.107
But not for lack of trying.

35:29.141 --> 35:31.242
Is there something
I should know?

35:31.277 --> 35:36.214
Well, to be completely
honest with you...

35:36.248 --> 35:38.783
Gale really screwed us up.

35:38.818 --> 35:40.652
I mean, not on purpose,
of course,

35:40.686 --> 35:42.988
but he just--
he set us way back,

35:43.022 --> 35:47.025
and we've been playing
catch-up ever since.

35:47.059 --> 35:51.062
<i>And I've had to be out
running errands</i>

35:51.097 --> 35:53.898
<i>and trying to keep us
on target.</i>

35:53.933 --> 35:56.634
Some of the equipment

35:56.669 --> 35:58.403
wasn't calibrated
correctly and--

35:58.437 --> 36:01.639
Well, it's just all
very technical and boring,

36:01.674 --> 36:04.876
but rest assured that--

36:04.910 --> 36:07.245
that we will
do whatever it takes.

36:07.279 --> 36:09.848
<i>It has my total attention.</i>

36:09.882 --> 36:12.083
<i>We'll cook through
the weekend if necessary.</i>

36:12.118 --> 36:16.454
We will have 400 pounds
for you by next week.

36:20.760 --> 36:22.560
I have your word on that?

36:22.595 --> 36:23.895
You do.

36:23.929 --> 36:27.565
You have my word on that.

36:27.600 --> 36:29.134
<i>Thank you for the update.</i>

36:56.562 --> 36:58.229
Any news?

36:58.264 --> 37:02.167
Nah, I'm just-- just wandering.

37:02.201 --> 37:04.202
How's everybody doing?

37:04.236 --> 37:07.872
Well, as well
as can be expected.

37:07.907 --> 37:11.142
It's this not knowing

37:11.177 --> 37:13.044
that's the hardest part,
I think.

37:14.880 --> 37:17.582
Anything new on these guys?

37:17.616 --> 37:19.617
Who they are?
What they wanted?

37:19.652 --> 37:21.786
No, nothing yet,

37:21.821 --> 37:23.788
but we'll get it.

37:27.693 --> 37:29.160
Steve...

37:31.430 --> 37:33.364
Do you think
there could maybe be others?

37:35.568 --> 37:38.570
Buddy, nobody's getting
to Hank.

37:38.604 --> 37:41.005
That was their one shot,
and they blew it.

37:41.040 --> 37:42.874
So, no.

37:44.376 --> 37:46.377
No way.

37:47.513 --> 37:48.880
Jesus.

37:48.914 --> 37:50.615
I'd love to walk in there

37:50.649 --> 37:52.617
and shoot that bastard
right in the head.

37:52.651 --> 37:54.052
Me, too.

37:59.358 --> 38:00.725
[cell phone rings]

38:02.361 --> 38:03.661
Yeah.

38:04.897 --> 38:06.264
Oh, yeah?

38:06.298 --> 38:09.000
Great. We'll be right down.

38:09.034 --> 38:10.635
Food's here.

38:10.669 --> 38:12.470
Hey, you like Pollos Hermanos?

38:15.674 --> 38:17.408
Uh, on occasion, yeah.

38:17.443 --> 38:19.310
Owner's a big booster
for the DEA.

38:19.345 --> 38:22.580
He heard what happened.
He's going to feed every cop in the building.

38:24.016 --> 38:25.783
That's-- That's wonderful.

38:25.818 --> 38:28.553
Yeah, and apparently he's
bringing it by personally.

38:32.024 --> 38:33.391
[elevator bell dings]

38:36.109 --> 38:37.810
[Marie] I don't even
know what to say.

38:37.844 --> 38:38.877
[Skyler]
That's an incredible--

38:38.912 --> 38:40.179
Good, huh?

38:40.213 --> 38:41.647
Delicious.

38:41.681 --> 38:44.850
[Marie] That's so generous of you.
Thank you very much.

38:44.884 --> 38:46.351
[Skyler] Yes, thank you.

38:46.386 --> 38:47.519
Guys, did you hear that?

38:47.554 --> 38:50.222
Mr. Fring is offering
a $10,000 reward

38:50.256 --> 38:52.224
on any information
about the case.

38:52.258 --> 38:55.828
Well, that's--
that's wonderful.

38:55.862 --> 38:58.397
Wow. Thank you, Mr. Fring.

38:58.431 --> 39:00.232
You're very welcome.

39:00.266 --> 39:02.301
Men like your husband
are the thin blue line

39:02.335 --> 39:04.436
between us and these animals.

39:04.471 --> 39:06.572
I only wish I could do more.

39:11.411 --> 39:13.645
Well, we do appreciate
your support.

39:13.680 --> 39:16.181
This reward could turn
the tide here.

39:16.216 --> 39:18.884
It'll really help.

39:18.918 --> 39:22.354
Again, I can't express
how sorry I am.

39:22.388 --> 39:24.656
As it happens,
I actually met Agent Schrader.

39:24.691 --> 39:26.792
[Marie] Really?

39:26.826 --> 39:30.028
Our fun run,
a couple months ago.

39:30.063 --> 39:33.432
Mr. Fring
was one of our sponsors.

39:33.466 --> 39:37.269
I talked for a few minutes
with your husband.

39:37.303 --> 39:41.006
As a matter of fact,
Mr. White, your name came up.

39:43.910 --> 39:46.778
Really? Huh.

39:46.813 --> 39:50.315
Yeah, there happened to be
a collection jar out for you,

39:50.350 --> 39:53.151
and we spoke briefly
about your health concerns.

39:53.186 --> 39:55.621
I hope that there's been
good news.

39:57.457 --> 40:01.493
Uh, yeah, things
have improved, yes.

40:01.528 --> 40:03.795
That's wonderful to hear.

40:03.830 --> 40:07.366
It was clear to me
how deeply he cares for you.

40:09.469 --> 40:13.572
Well, I've taken up
enough of your time.

40:13.606 --> 40:17.976
Um... thank you
again very much.

40:18.011 --> 40:19.478
It was a great pleasure
to meet you.

40:19.512 --> 40:21.647
Thank you. 
[Walter, Jr.] Yes, thank you.

40:23.816 --> 40:26.084
Let me walk you out.
Oh-- Oh, no, it's not necessary.

40:32.759 --> 40:36.028
You know,
I didn't say thank you.

40:36.062 --> 40:37.162
I'll walk him out.

40:37.196 --> 40:38.664
I'll be right back.

40:40.333 --> 40:43.635
Hi. How are you?
Good to see you.

40:43.670 --> 40:45.304
Enjoying the chicken?

40:45.338 --> 40:47.339
Good. Good-- Hey.

40:47.373 --> 40:49.608
Oh, you're very welcome.
My pleasure.

40:49.642 --> 40:51.243
My pleasure, yeah.
Excuse me.

40:51.277 --> 40:52.844
Thank you. Thank you.

40:52.879 --> 40:54.413
It's good chicken, huh?
Yeah.

40:54.447 --> 40:55.714
Good.
Mr. Fring.

40:55.748 --> 40:57.282
May I--
Mr. White.

40:57.317 --> 40:59.084
I just wanted
to thank you again.

40:59.118 --> 41:00.586
Oh, it's my pleasure.

41:00.620 --> 41:02.955
Uh, may I--
may I speak with you?

41:02.989 --> 41:04.323
Just a moment?

41:09.028 --> 41:11.129
You knew.

41:11.164 --> 41:13.699
You knew my brother-in-law
was with the DEA.

41:15.068 --> 41:18.070
I investigate everyone
with whom I do business.

41:18.104 --> 41:20.939
What careful man wouldn't?

41:20.974 --> 41:23.875
He is not a problem for us,

41:23.910 --> 41:25.944
for our business.

41:29.115 --> 41:32.150
Your being here is--

41:32.185 --> 41:35.754
Is this some sort of message?

41:35.788 --> 41:38.156
I'm supporting my community.

41:38.191 --> 41:40.993
I hide in plain sight,
same as you.

Are we done?

41:42.261 --> 41:43.261
No-- No, listen, I--

41:43.296 --> 41:44.630
This attack
on my brother-in-law--

41:44.664 --> 41:46.765
I don't--
I don't understand it.

41:46.799 --> 41:48.667
I don't know what it means.

41:48.701 --> 41:52.938
Please, if you have
some knowledge

41:52.972 --> 41:54.506
that you could share with me.

42:00.046 --> 42:02.648
I fear for my family.

42:02.682 --> 42:03.782
I'm sure they'll be fine.

42:03.816 --> 42:06.351
I am told the assassin
that survived

42:06.386 --> 42:07.853
is gravely injured.

42:07.887 --> 42:09.655
It's doubtful he'll live.

42:13.259 --> 42:15.594
Now thank me and shake my hand.

42:19.565 --> 42:22.501
Uh-- thank you.
Thank you again.

42:22.535 --> 42:24.536
You're quite welcome,
Mr. White.

42:35.214 --> 42:38.216
What's going on?

42:38.251 --> 42:40.018
What's happening?

43:38.177 --> 43:41.046
Your man died.
I heard.

43:41.080 --> 43:42.180
It's unfortunate.

43:42.215 --> 43:43.548
<i>Yeah, "unfortunate,"</i>

43:43.583 --> 43:46.618
<i>and meanwhile I have Federales
surrounding my house.</i>

43:46.652 --> 43:48.954
You know what I think, Gustavo?

43:48.988 --> 43:50.455
I think you're behind all this.

43:50.490 --> 43:54.259
Why would I do this?
How would it serve me?

43:54.293 --> 43:56.228
<i>That's the part I'm trying
to figure out.</i>

43:56.262 --> 43:59.364
Go off on your own, maybe.

43:59.398 --> 44:00.966
Would you actually think
that would work?

44:01.000 --> 44:04.035
<i>Juan, you sound like
you're under a lot of stress.</i>

44:04.070 --> 44:05.403
<i>Maybe you should call me back</i>

44:05.438 --> 44:06.872
when you're seeing things
more clearly.

44:06.906 --> 44:08.740
I see things clear enough.

44:08.775 --> 44:12.444
One DEA gets shot.
All of Washington starts barking.

44:12.478 --> 44:14.646
The D.F. suddenly
has to put on a big show,

44:14.680 --> 44:17.649
<i>and I wind up with Federales
in my rose bushes.</i>

44:17.683 --> 44:19.451
<i>But just for a while.</i>

44:19.485 --> 44:23.922
Appearances, politics.

44:23.956 --> 44:25.991
<i>Are you still there,
Gustavo?</i>

44:26.025 --> 44:29.127
Yes, I'm here.

44:29.162 --> 44:31.830
<i>I'll weather this.
I always do.</i>

44:31.864 --> 44:33.732
My brother's a police chief.

44:33.766 --> 44:36.334
I got connections.
They'll get me through.

44:36.369 --> 44:38.770
And when I get proof

44:38.805 --> 44:42.174
and the others find out
what you've done,

44:42.208 --> 44:45.043
maybe we come pay you a visit.

44:45.077 --> 44:47.345
<i>Maybe we c--

44:47.380 --> 44:48.613
<i>[speaks Spanish]</i>

44:48.648 --> 44:49.981
[Men shouting]

44:50.016 --> 44:51.249
[speaks Spanish]

44:51.284 --> 44:52.818
[shouts in Spanish]

44:52.852 --> 44:54.753
[gunfire]

44:54.787 --> 44:56.688
[speaks Spanish]

44:56.722 --> 44:58.056
[glass shatters]

45:02.428 --> 45:03.762
<i>[gunfire]</i>

45:06.199 --> 45:07.999
<i>[gunfire]</i>

45:34.660 --> 45:36.061
Skyler. Skyler.

45:36.095 --> 45:37.863
Marie. Marie.

45:39.398 --> 45:41.967
Oh, how is he?
Tell me something good.

45:42.001 --> 45:44.970
I think he's stable enough now
for you to go see him briefly.

45:45.004 --> 45:47.739
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
it's immediately family only.

45:47.773 --> 45:49.007
We're all family.

45:49.041 --> 45:50.308
I understand,

45:50.343 --> 45:52.644
but we have a certain protocol
here that we need--

45:52.678 --> 45:55.280
We're all family.

46:02.021 --> 46:07.325
