00:35.750 --> 00:36.709
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT

00:36.792 --> 00:40.084
WITH JOHN OLIVER."

00:40.167 --> 00:41.084
I AM JOHN OLIVER.

00:41.167 --> 00:42.084
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:42.167 --> 00:42.333
US.

00:42.417 --> 00:43.542
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

00:43.625 --> 00:44.291
THE WEEK, AND IT WAS A

00:44.375 --> 00:45.291
WHIRLWIND, FROM A MASS SHOOTING

00:45.375 --> 00:46.375
AND WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA TO

00:46.458 --> 00:47.792
JIM ACOSTA BEING BANNED FROM THE

00:47.875 --> 00:48.792
WHITE HOUSE TO TRUMP SKIPPING A

00:48.875 --> 00:50.291
COMMEMORATION FOR WORLD WAR I

00:50.375 --> 00:51.583
SOLDIERS IN FRANCE BECAUSE IT

00:51.667 --> 00:53.792
WAS RAINING.

00:53.875 --> 00:55.084
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:55.167 --> 00:56.917
THAT MIGHT BE FOR THE BEST,

00:57.001 --> 00:57.959
BECAUSE YOU JUST KNOW IF HE'D

00:58.042 --> 00:59.001
GONE, SOMEONE WOULD'VE HAD TO

00:59.084 --> 01:00.250
TELL HIM HE CAN'T SIT ON

01:00.333 --> 01:01.041
PEOPLE'S GRAVESTONES JUST 'CAUSE

01:01.041 --> 01:01.209
PEOPLE'S GRAVESTONES JUST 'CAUSE
HE'S TIRED.

01:01.209 --> 01:02.125
HE'S TIRED.

01:02.208 --> 01:03.125
AND OF COURSE, IN THE MIDDLE OF

01:03.208 --> 01:04.542
ALL THIS, THERE WAS THE MIDTERMS

01:04.625 --> 01:06.000
ON TUESDAY, IN WHICH DEMOCRATS

01:06.000 --> 01:06.167
ON TUESDAY, IN WHICH DEMOCRATS
WON CONTROL OF THE HOUSE --

01:06.167 --> 01:07.542
WON CONTROL OF THE HOUSE --

01:07.625 --> 01:09.291
OBJECTIVELY A BAD RESULT FOR

01:09.375 --> 01:11.291
TRUMP, ALTHOUGH NOT ACCORDING TO

01:11.375 --> 01:13.000
HIM.

01:13.083 --> 01:14.458
>> YOU'RE A MAN WHO LIKES TO

01:14.542 --> 01:16.208
WIN, BUT LAST NIGHT WAS NOT AN

01:16.291 --> 01:18.875
ABSOLUTE VICTORY FOR YOU.

01:18.959 --> 01:20.792
>> I'LL BE HONEST, I THOUGHT IT

01:20.875 --> 01:22.792
WAS A -- I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY

01:22.875 --> 01:25.000
CLOSE-TO-COMPLETE VICTORY.

01:25.000 --> 01:25.167
CLOSE-TO-COMPLETE VICTORY.
>> John: COMPLETE VICTORY?

01:25.167 --> 01:27.250
>> John: COMPLETE VICTORY?

01:27.333 --> 01:29.041
YOU LOST THE HOUSE.

01:29.041 --> 01:29.209
YOU LOST THE HOUSE.
TRUMP HAS AN INCREDIBLE ABILITY

01:29.209 --> 01:30.375
TRUMP HAS AN INCREDIBLE ABILITY

01:30.458 --> 01:32.417
TO FRAME DEFEAT AS TRIUMPH.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.834
"YES, YOU HAVE TAKEN MY KING,

01:33.917 --> 01:35.709
BUT I STILL HAVE ALL MY HORSES,

01:35.792 --> 01:37.250
AND THIS IS HORSE CHESS, SO MY

01:37.333 --> 01:38.750
HORSE KING TAKES YOUR LITTLE GUY

01:38.834 --> 01:41.041
THAT LOOKS LIKE A BOOBIE.

01:41.041 --> 01:41.167
THAT LOOKS LIKE A BOOBIE.
HORSE-MATE."

01:41.167 --> 01:41.875
HORSE-MATE."

01:41.959 --> 01:43.250
NOW, WHAT WAS EVEN WEIRDER IN

01:43.333 --> 01:45.126
THAT PRESS CONFERENCE WAS

01:45.209 --> 01:47.792
TRUMP'S GLEE AT THE LOSSES OF

01:47.875 --> 01:48.291
REPUBLICANS WHO DIDN'T EMBRACE

01:48.375 --> 01:49.001
HIM DURING THEIR CAMPAIGNS,

01:49.084 --> 01:49.875
BECAUSE, BEAR IN MIND WHEN

01:49.959 --> 01:50.542
YOU'RE WATCHING THIS, THESE

01:50.625 --> 01:53.500
LOSSES WERE BAD FOR HIM.

01:53.583 --> 01:55.000
>> YOU HAD SOME THAT DECIDED TO,

01:55.000 --> 01:55.167
>> YOU HAD SOME THAT DECIDED TO,
LET'S STAY AWAY, LET'S STAY

01:55.167 --> 01:56.084
LET'S STAY AWAY, LET'S STAY

01:56.167 --> 01:57.166
AWAY.

01:57.250 --> 01:58.458
THEY DID VERY POORLY.

01:58.542 --> 02:01.000
MIKE COFFMAN.

02:01.083 --> 02:03.042
TOO BAD, MIKE.

02:03.126 --> 02:04.250
MIA LOVE.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.917
MIA LOVE GAVE ME NO LOVE, AND

02:07.001 --> 02:10.250
SHE LOST.

02:10.333 --> 02:11.458
TOO BAD.

02:11.542 --> 02:13.375
SORRY ABOUT THAT, MIA.

02:13.458 --> 02:15.000
>> John: I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW

02:15.000 --> 02:15.167
>> John: I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WORSE THERE.

02:15.167 --> 02:16.333
WHAT'S WORSE THERE.

02:16.417 --> 02:17.542
HIS PETTY DELIGHT OVER THE

02:17.625 --> 02:18.500
LOSSES OF HIS OWN PARTY, OR HIS

02:18.583 --> 02:19.000
PETTY DELIGHT IN HIS OWN DUMB

02:19.083 --> 02:21.625
WORDPLAY.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.042
I BET HE WAS IN BED THAT NIGHT

02:23.126 --> 02:23.542
SAYING, "MELANIA, DID YOU HEAR

02:23.625 --> 02:24.542
THAT JOKE ABOUT MIA LOVE?

02:24.625 --> 02:26.750
WHERE I SAID SHE GAVE ME NO

02:26.834 --> 02:27.625
LOVE?"

02:27.709 --> 02:29.000
TO WHICH MELANIA WOULD REPLY, "I

02:29.000 --> 02:29.167
TO WHICH MELANIA WOULD REPLY, "I
CAN'T HEAR YOU.

02:29.167 --> 02:29.458
CAN'T HEAR YOU.

02:29.542 --> 02:31.083
WE LITERALLY SLEEP IN DIFFERENT

02:31.166 --> 02:32.583
BEDROOMS."

02:32.667 --> 02:35.084
BUT MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE

02:35.167 --> 02:35.625
RESPONSE TO A LOSS TOOK PLACE IN

02:35.709 --> 02:37.126
NEVADA, WHERE DANNY TARKANIAN

02:37.209 --> 02:38.250
LOST HIS BID FOR A CONGRESSIONAL

02:38.333 --> 02:39.959
SEAT.

02:40.042 --> 02:41.291
IT WAS HIS SIXTH RUN FOR OFFICE

02:41.375 --> 02:42.417
AND HIS SIXTH LOSS, AND HIS WIFE

02:42.500 --> 02:46.000
HAD SOME CHOICE WORDS FOR

02:46.083 --> 02:47.208
HAD SOME CHOICE WORDS FOR

02:47.291 --> 02:48.709
VOTERS.

02:48.792 --> 02:50.250
>> THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THE

02:50.333 --> 02:51.834
VOTERS TO COMPLAIN WHEN YOU ARE

02:51.917 --> 02:52.709
GOING TO PUT A LIAR INTO OFFICE.

02:52.792 --> 02:55.084
IT IS YOUR FAULT.

02:55.167 --> 02:56.875
MY HUSBAND HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE.

02:56.959 --> 02:59.084
OUR FAMILY HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE.

02:59.167 --> 03:00.208
I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOD HAS IN

03:00.291 --> 03:02.126
STORE FOR US, BUT THERE IS NO

03:02.209 --> 03:03.583
WAY IN HELL THAT WE WENT THROUGH

03:03.667 --> 03:05.042
ALL THIS FOR NOTHING.

03:05.126 --> 03:07.917
>> John: WOW.

03:08.001 --> 03:10.208
SHE IS PISSED.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.875
ALTHOUGH, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE

03:11.959 --> 03:13.542
GOING TO BRING GOD'S PLAN INTO

03:13.625 --> 03:15.000
THIS, IT DOES SEEM LIKE GOD HAS

03:15.083 --> 03:16.041
BEEN UP IN HEAVEN SAYING, "YOU

03:16.041 --> 03:16.209
BEEN UP IN HEAVEN SAYING, "YOU
KNOW WHAT'D BE REALLY FUNNY?

03:16.209 --> 03:17.458
KNOW WHAT'D BE REALLY FUNNY?

03:17.542 --> 03:19.125
IF I MAKE DANNY TARKANIAN LOSE

03:19.208 --> 03:20.709
SIX ELECTIONS IN A ROW JUST TO

03:20.792 --> 03:24.291
SEE IF HIS WIFE FUCKING SNAPS."

03:24.375 --> 03:26.042
AND, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS ALSO

03:26.126 --> 03:26.917
SOME GENUINELY GOOD NEWS THAT

03:27.001 --> 03:27.792
YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE NOTICED

03:27.875 --> 03:29.084
CONCERNING THE MIDTERMS.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.126
THREE STATES VOTED TO EXPAND

03:30.209 --> 03:31.208
MEDICAID.

03:31.291 --> 03:32.166
FLORIDA RESTORED VOTING RIGHTS

03:32.250 --> 03:33.375
TO PEOPLE WITH FELONY

03:33.458 --> 03:34.333
CONVICTIONS.

03:34.417 --> 03:35.625
AND UTAH EVEN VOTED TO LEGALIZE

03:35.709 --> 03:36.792
MEDICAL MARIJUANA, WHICH MEANS

03:36.875 --> 03:38.208
THAT IN THE NOT-SO-DISTANT

03:38.291 --> 03:39.500
FUTURE, THERE'S A GENUINE CHANCE

03:39.583 --> 03:41.458
MITT ROMNEY COULD BE LYING ON A

03:41.542 --> 03:43.041
BED STONED OUT OF HIS MIND

03:43.125 --> 03:44.500
GIGGLING AND ASKING HIS WIFE,

03:44.583 --> 03:46.041
"DO YOU THINK WE HAVE, LIKE, TOO

03:46.041 --> 03:46.209
"DO YOU THINK WE HAVE, LIKE, TOO
MANY SONS?"

03:46.209 --> 03:51.208
MANY SONS?"

03:51.291 --> 03:52.834
ALL OF WHICH IS GOOD NEWS, BUT

03:52.917 --> 03:54.166
IT QUICKLY GOT SWAMPED BY THE

03:54.250 --> 03:56.126
LATEST DEVELOPMENT IN THE STORY

03:56.209 --> 03:56.709
THAT WE'VE BEEN CALLING

03:56.792 --> 03:58.084
STUPID WATERGATE, BECAUSE ON

03:58.167 --> 04:00.208
WEDNESDAY, TRUMP DID THE THING

04:00.291 --> 04:00.959
WE'VE ALL KIND OF BEEN BRACING

04:01.042 --> 04:03.583
FOR.

04:03.667 --> 04:04.709
>> JEFF SESSIONS, UNTIL LAST

04:04.792 --> 04:07.333
NIGHT, DONALD TRUMP'S

04:07.417 --> 04:08.625
ATTORNEY GENERAL AND PUNCH BAG.

04:08.709 --> 04:09.834
AFTER MONTHS OF PUBLIC ABUSE,

04:09.917 --> 04:12.001
THE PRESIDENT FINALLY MOVED FROM

04:12.084 --> 04:12.917
RIDICULING HIS SENIOR

04:13.001 --> 04:14.542
LAW OFFICER TO FIRING HIM.

04:14.625 --> 04:16.542
>> John: IT'S TRUE, TRUMP

04:16.625 --> 04:18.126
FINALLY FIRED JEFF SESSIONS.

04:18.209 --> 04:18.792
AND EVERYONE IN AMERICA HAS BEEN

04:18.875 --> 04:20.291
WAITING FOR THIS PARTICULAR SHOE

04:20.375 --> 04:21.291
TO DROP, EXCEPT JEFF SESSIONS,

04:21.375 --> 04:22.583
WHO IS ALWAYS WAITING FOR ANY

04:22.667 --> 04:24.001
SHOE TO DROP FOR FEAR THAT HE

04:24.084 --> 04:25.250
WILL BE CRUSHED UNDERNEATH IT.

04:25.333 --> 04:26.792
TRUMP IMMEDIATELY APPOINTED AS

04:26.875 --> 04:28.084
ACTING A.G. SESSIONS' FORMER

04:28.167 --> 04:29.250
CHIEF OF STAFF AND OLDEST PERSON

04:29.333 --> 04:30.750
IN HIS KARATE CLASS,

04:30.834 --> 04:32.291
MATT WHITAKER.

04:32.375 --> 04:33.875
AND EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT

04:33.959 --> 04:35.084
APPOINTMENT IS WEIRD, STARTING

04:35.167 --> 04:36.750
WITH THE FACT THAT SESSIONS'

04:36.834 --> 04:37.917
NATURAL SUCCESSOR WOULD BE

04:38.001 --> 04:39.500
ROD ROSENSTEIN.

04:39.583 --> 04:40.458
BUT TRUMP IS FAMOUSLY NOT A FAN

04:40.542 --> 04:41.458
OF HIM, AS HE'S BEEN PROTECTING

04:41.542 --> 04:42.792
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION.

04:42.875 --> 04:44.917
SO INSTEAD, TRUMP SHOVED

04:45.001 --> 04:46.250
WHITE SHREK HERE INTO THE JOB,

04:46.333 --> 04:48.458
AND THAT IS TROUBLING FOR ANY

04:48.542 --> 04:50.750
NUMBER OF REASONS, FROM THE FACT

04:50.834 --> 04:52.125
THAT HE'S BEEN A REGULAR CRITIC

04:52.208 --> 04:54.084
OF THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION TO

04:54.167 --> 04:54.875
HIS QUESTIONABLE JUDICIAL

04:54.959 --> 04:56.542
PHILOSOPHY, BOTH CRITICIZING

04:56.625 --> 04:57.625
MARBURY VS. MADISON -- A BEDROCK

04:57.709 --> 04:58.709
SUPREME COURT DECISION -- AND

04:58.792 --> 05:00.126
SUGGESTING THAT THE KEY

05:00.209 --> 05:00.875
CRITERION FOR JUDGES IS,

05:00.959 --> 05:01.834
"DO THEY HAVE A BIBLICAL VIEW OF

05:01.917 --> 05:04.000
JUSTICE?"

05:04.083 --> 05:05.667
BUT MAYBE THE MOST EYE-CATCHING

05:05.750 --> 05:07.041
THING IN WHITAKER'S BACKGROUND

05:07.041 --> 05:07.209
THING IN WHITAKER'S BACKGROUND
IS THIS:

05:07.209 --> 05:09.083
IS THIS:

05:09.166 --> 05:11.000
>> THE FBI'S INVESTIGATING A

05:11.083 --> 05:12.126
NOW-SHUTDOWN FLORIDA COMPANY

05:12.209 --> 05:13.001
THAT WHITAKER WAS AN ADVISER FOR

05:13.084 --> 05:14.291
BEGINNING IN 2014.

05:14.375 --> 05:15.417
WORLD PATENT MARKETING BILLED

05:15.500 --> 05:16.667
ITSELF AS HELPING INVENTORS

05:16.750 --> 05:17.583
SECURE PATENTS, BUT THE FEDERAL

05:17.667 --> 05:19.000
TRADE COMMISSION WON A JUDGMENT

05:19.083 --> 05:20.583
AGAINST THE COMPANY FOR BILKING

05:20.667 --> 05:22.333
THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS OUT OF

05:22.417 --> 05:25.041
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.042
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

05:27.126 --> 05:28.041
WORLD PATENT MARKETING WAS A

05:28.125 --> 05:29.333
SCAM, WHICH IS TERRIBLE, 'CAUSE

05:29.417 --> 05:31.250
IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE MONEY

05:31.333 --> 05:33.125
OFF CRUSHING INVENTORS' DREAMS,

05:33.208 --> 05:34.458
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST DO IT ON

05:34.542 --> 05:35.917
TELEVISION WHERE WE CAN ALL

05:36.001 --> 05:38.166
ENJOY THE CAR CRASH.

05:38.250 --> 05:39.667
BUT IT IS TRUE THAT THE FTC

05:39.750 --> 05:41.001
ACTUALLY SHUT THE COMPANY DOWN

05:41.084 --> 05:42.000
AS PART OF A SETTLEMENT THAT

05:42.000 --> 05:42.167
AS PART OF A SETTLEMENT THAT
ALSO INCLUDED A JUDGMENT OF OVER

05:42.167 --> 05:43.083
ALSO INCLUDED A JUDGMENT OF OVER

05:43.166 --> 05:44.500
$25 MILLION.

05:44.583 --> 05:45.792
AND THAT'S A REAL PITY, BECAUSE

05:45.875 --> 05:47.125
WORLD PATENT MARKETING'S CLIENTS

05:47.208 --> 05:48.417
HAD SOME TRULY INCREDIBLE IDEAS,

05:48.500 --> 05:50.667
LIKE SUPREME DIVA JEANS, PADDED

05:50.750 --> 05:52.000
PANTS THAT HELP AUGMENT YOUR

05:52.083 --> 05:55.250
LADY BUMPS.

05:55.333 --> 05:56.834
AND BEFORE I SHOW YOU A

05:56.917 --> 05:58.333
COMMERCIAL FOR THOSE BUTT PANTS,

05:58.417 --> 05:59.250
I SHOULD PROBABLY WARN YOU, THIS

05:59.333 --> 06:02.084
IS GOING TO GET PRETTY

06:02.167 --> 06:03.083
TECHNICAL.

06:03.166 --> 06:04.792
>> SCIENCE TELLS US WHY ALL MEN

06:04.875 --> 06:06.291
LIKE BIG BUTTS.

06:06.375 --> 06:07.417
MEN AREN'T AWARE WHY THEY'RE

06:07.500 --> 06:09.375
ATTRACTED TO BIGGER BUTTS, BUT

06:09.458 --> 06:12.834
ATTRACTED THEY ARE.

06:12.917 --> 06:15.041
ATTRACTED THEY ARE.

06:15.041 --> 06:15.209
ATTRACTED THEY ARE.
IN THE EARLY HUNTER-GATHERING

06:15.209 --> 06:15.709
IN THE EARLY HUNTER-GATHERING

06:15.792 --> 06:16.166
SOCIETIES, IT GAVE WOMEN AN

06:16.250 --> 06:18.000
ADVANTAGE TO FORAGE FOR FOOD

06:18.083 --> 06:20.001
WHILE BEARING CHILDREN.

06:20.084 --> 06:21.750
AND SPEAKING OF BABIES, WOMEN

06:21.834 --> 06:23.041
WITH BIG BUTTS APPARENTLY HAVE

06:23.041 --> 06:23.209
WITH BIG BUTTS APPARENTLY HAVE
SMARTER KIDS.

06:23.209 --> 06:27.041
SMARTER KIDS.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.375
EVOLUTION ISN'T ABOUT SURVIVAL

06:28.458 --> 06:29.750
OF THE FITTEST, IT'S ABOUT

06:29.834 --> 06:32.709
SURVIVAL OF THE BIGGEST.

06:32.792 --> 06:33.959
>> John: EXACTLY.

06:34.042 --> 06:35.250
A BIGGER BUTT MAKES YOU BETTER

06:35.333 --> 06:36.542
AT FORAGING FOR FOOD AND MAKES

06:36.625 --> 06:37.500
YOUR CHILDREN SMARTER.

06:37.583 --> 06:39.834
THAT IS SCIENCE RIGHT THERE.

06:39.917 --> 06:40.750
I BELIEVE THEY'RE REFERENCING

06:40.834 --> 06:42.042
STUDIES PUBLISHED IN

06:42.126 --> 06:43.000
"JAMA," THE JOURNAL OF

06:43.000 --> 06:43.167
"JAMA," THE JOURNAL OF
THE AMERICAN MIX-A-LOT

06:43.167 --> 06:44.417
THE AMERICAN MIX-A-LOT

06:44.500 --> 06:45.625
ASSOCIATION.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.458
THEIR ANACONDA DON'T WANT NONE

06:47.542 --> 06:48.125
UNLESS IT'S RIGOROUSLY

06:48.208 --> 06:50.542
PEER-REVIEWED, HUN.

06:50.625 --> 06:52.166
NOW, UNFORTUNATELY, WORLD PATENT

06:52.250 --> 06:54.001
MARKETING LET THAT INVENTOR

06:54.084 --> 06:55.542
DOWN, BECAUSE ACCORDING TO COURT

06:55.625 --> 06:58.875
DOCUMENTS, THEY MISFILED HER

06:58.959 --> 07:00.083
PATENT AND LEFT HER WITH NOTHING

07:00.166 --> 07:01.001
BUT A PROTOTYPE, SOME SAMPLES, A

07:01.084 --> 07:03.126
PRESS RELEASE, AND NEGATIVE

07:03.209 --> 07:04.166
$40,000.

07:04.250 --> 07:05.709
WHICH, AGAIN, IS A REAL SHAME,

07:05.792 --> 07:07.126
BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY TRACKED THAT

07:07.209 --> 07:09.001
INVENTOR DOWN, AND I AM HERE TO

07:09.084 --> 07:10.041
TELL YOU, THESE THINGS REALLY

07:10.125 --> 07:12.000
WORK.

07:12.000 --> 07:12.167
WORK.
SERIOUSLY.

07:12.167 --> 07:13.792
SERIOUSLY.

07:13.875 --> 07:15.084
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO TAKE A

07:15.167 --> 07:19.083
LOOK AT THIS.

07:19.166 --> 07:20.500
BECAUSE NORMALLY FROM BEHIND, I

07:20.583 --> 07:22.084
LOOK LIKE IF FLAT STANLEY HAD

07:22.167 --> 07:23.042
OSTEOPOROSIS.

07:23.126 --> 07:27.041
NOW I'M ROCKING GENUINE CHEEKS.

07:27.125 --> 07:28.542
I'VE GONE FROM EMPTY DINNER

07:28.625 --> 07:30.125
PLATE TO CHRISTMAS HAM IN ONE

07:30.208 --> 07:32.291
EASY PAYMENT OF $125 PLUS

07:32.375 --> 07:34.917
SHIPPING AND HANDLING.

07:35.001 --> 07:36.125
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW FUCKING

07:36.208 --> 07:37.041
GREAT I'M GOING TO BE AT

07:37.041 --> 07:37.209
GREAT I'M GOING TO BE AT
FORAGING FOR FOOD WITH THIS

07:37.209 --> 07:38.709
FORAGING FOR FOOD WITH THIS

07:38.792 --> 07:39.291
THING?

07:39.375 --> 07:40.959
I'M GOING TO EAT SO MANY THINGS

07:41.042 --> 07:43.000
I FIND ON THE GROUND!

07:43.000 --> 07:43.167
I FIND ON THE GROUND!
AND REMEMBER --

07:43.167 --> 07:47.875
AND REMEMBER --

07:47.959 --> 07:51.125
WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER

07:51.208 --> 07:52.208
HERE IS, A PAID ADVISER TO THAT

07:52.291 --> 07:53.792
PATENT COMPANY IS NOW OUR

07:53.875 --> 07:56.458
CURRENT ACTING A.G.

07:56.542 --> 07:58.458
AND WHILE HE SAYS HE WAS NOT

07:58.542 --> 07:59.667
AWARE OF ANY FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY

07:59.750 --> 08:05.084
BY THE COMPANY, HE SEEMED PRETTY

08:05.167 --> 08:05.917
HANDS-ON, APPEARING IN VIDEOS

08:06.001 --> 08:06.667
FOR THEM AND SAYING IN A PRESS

08:06.750 --> 08:07.583
RELEASE THAT "AS A FORMER

08:07.667 --> 08:08.542
U.S. ATTORNEY, I WOULD ONLY

08:08.625 --> 08:09.375
ALIGN MYSELF WITH A FIRST-CLASS

08:09.458 --> 08:10.291
ORGANIZATION."

08:10.375 --> 08:11.291
AND WHEN ONE WPM CLIENT

08:11.375 --> 08:12.291
THREATENED TO FILE A COMPLAINT,

08:12.375 --> 08:13.583
WHITAKER THREATENED HIM WITH

08:13.667 --> 08:14.625
LEGAL ACTION, SAYING, "I'M

08:14.709 --> 08:16.001
ASSUMING YOU UNDERSTAND THAT

08:16.084 --> 08:17.084
THERE COULD BE SERIOUS CIVIL AND

08:17.167 --> 08:18.083
CRIMINAL CONSEQUENCES FOR YOU,"

08:18.166 --> 08:20.126
AND REMINDING THEM HE WAS A

08:20.209 --> 08:20.959
FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, WHICH IS

08:21.042 --> 08:22.625
PROBABLY SOMETHING HE DOES

08:22.709 --> 08:24.041
ACTUALLY HAVE TO REMIND PEOPLE

08:24.125 --> 08:26.001
ABOUT HIM A LOT, BECAUSE HE

08:26.084 --> 08:28.834
DOESN'T LOOK SO MUCH AS A

08:28.917 --> 08:31.875
U.S. ATTORNEY AS MUCH AS A

08:31.959 --> 08:32.667
KENMORE REFRIGERATOR THAT

08:32.750 --> 08:38.834
SOMEHOW ESCAPED FROM A SEARS.

08:38.917 --> 08:40.126
AND LOOK, THERE'S A LOT THAT'S

08:40.209 --> 08:41.125
COMPLETELY DISQUALIFYING HERE,

08:41.208 --> 08:42.375
BUT I'D ARGUE THE BIGGEST

08:42.458 --> 08:43.208
RED FLAG IS THAT, AS OF THIS

08:43.291 --> 08:45.042
TAPING, THIS IS STILL THE PHOTO

08:45.126 --> 08:46.667
ATOP HIS TWITTER PAGE.

08:46.750 --> 08:47.250
AND FIRST, I GOT TO SAY, FROM

08:47.333 --> 08:50.542
ONE LIFTER TO ANOTHER, RESPECT.

08:50.625 --> 08:51.750
JUST, UM -- JUST LOOK AT THIS

08:51.834 --> 08:52.875
ABSOLUTE UNIT TURNING ON THE

08:52.959 --> 08:54.792
FORKLIFT.

08:54.875 --> 08:56.375
BUSTIN' ASS AND BUILDING MASS.

08:56.458 --> 08:57.875
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO PASS THOSE

08:57.959 --> 08:59.667
PLATES TO JESUS, AM I RIGHT?

08:59.750 --> 09:01.042
PUNCH YOUR TICKET AT THE

09:01.126 --> 09:02.000

JUST PRETENDIN'.

09:04.208 --> 09:06.667
#BeastMode.

09:06.750 --> 09:08.000
I WILL, HOWEVER, POINT OUT THAT,

09:08.000 --> 09:08.167
I WILL, HOWEVER, POINT OUT THAT,
IN OTHER PHOTOS OF HIM LIFTING,

09:08.167 --> 09:10.917
IN OTHER PHOTOS OF HIM LIFTING,

09:11.001 --> 09:13.250
HE HAS A JAPANESE TATTOO ON THE

09:13.333 --> 09:14.166
INSIDE OF HIS ARM, WHICH, WHEN

09:14.250 --> 09:16.166
TRANSLATED, READS "FALL DOWN

09:16.250 --> 09:18.333
SEVEN TIMES, GET UP EIGHT."

09:18.417 --> 09:20.042
AND LOOK, I HATE TO CRITICIZE A

09:20.126 --> 09:21.709
JAPANESE PROVERB, BUT HOW CAN

09:21.792 --> 09:23.125
YOU GET UP EIGHT TIMES WHEN

09:23.208 --> 09:24.917
YOU'VE ONLY FALLEN DOWN SEVEN?

09:25.001 --> 09:25.959
IF YOU FALL DOWN SEVEN TIMES,

09:26.042 --> 09:26.917
YOU ONLY NEED TO GET UP SEVEN

09:27.001 --> 09:31.126
TIMES.

09:31.209 --> 09:32.042
ALSO, AND I CAN NOT EMPHASIZE

09:32.126 --> 09:33.625
THIS ENOUGH, IF YOU'RE FALLING

09:33.709 --> 09:35.250
SEVEN TIMES, YOU SHOULD REALLY

09:35.333 --> 09:36.250
INVEST IN A PAIR OF

09:36.333 --> 09:40.333
SUPREME DIVA JEANS.

09:40.417 --> 09:41.166
EVERY TIME YOU FALL, YOU BOUNCE

09:41.250 --> 09:41.959
RIGHT BACK UP.

09:42.042 --> 09:42.583
THAT'S CALLED AN EVOLUTIONARY

09:42.667 --> 09:48.333
ADVANTAGE RIGHT THERE.

09:48.417 --> 09:49.792
LISTEN, IT SHOULD BE PRETTY

09:49.875 --> 09:50.583
CLEAR WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

09:50.667 --> 09:51.667
TRUMP WANTS A TOADY WHO WILL

09:51.750 --> 09:52.875
RESTRAIN MUELLER, AND WHITAKER

09:52.959 --> 09:53.417
APPEARS TO BE THAT GUY.

09:53.500 --> 09:54.083
YET THE WHITE HOUSE WAS

09:54.166 --> 09:55.042
AMAZINGLY REPORTEDLY SURPRISED

09:55.126 --> 09:55.875
BY THE CRITICISM OF WHITAKER AND

09:55.959 --> 09:56.709
THINKS IT COULD JEOPARDIZE HIS

09:56.792 --> 09:57.709
CHANCES OF REMAINING IN THE

09:57.792 --> 10:01.625
POST.

10:01.709 --> 10:02.834
BUT HOW IS TRUMP GOING TO

10:02.917 --> 10:04.001
DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM WHITAKER?

10:04.084 --> 10:04.709
HE MADE HIM ACTING

10:04.792 --> 10:05.792
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

10:05.875 --> 10:06.917
HE MET HIM IN THE OVAL OFFICE

10:07.001 --> 10:08.208
MORE THAN A DOZEN TIMES.

10:08.291 --> 10:09.333
HE WENT ON FOX NEWS AND SAID

10:09.417 --> 10:10.333
"MATT WHITAKER'S A GREAT GUY.

10:10.417 --> 10:12.959
I MEAN, I KNOW MATT WHITAKER."

10:13.042 --> 10:14.542
BUT BY FRIDAY MORNING, TRUMP WAS

10:14.625 --> 10:15.166
ALREADY DESPERATELY

10:15.250 --> 10:16.792
BACKPEDALING.

10:16.875 --> 10:17.875
>> WELL, MATT WHITAKER --

10:17.959 --> 10:20.458
I DON'T KNOW MATT WHITAKER.

10:20.542 --> 10:21.083
MATT WHITAKER WORKED FOR

10:21.166 --> 10:22.417
JEFF SESSIONS, AND HE WAS ALWAYS

10:22.500 --> 10:23.709
EXTREMELY HIGHLY THOUGHT-OF, AND

10:23.792 --> 10:29.001
HE STILL IS.

10:29.084 --> 10:30.126
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW

10:30.209 --> 10:31.041
MATT WHITAKER.

10:31.041 --> 10:31.209
MATT WHITAKER.
>> John: OKAY, SO THAT IS JUST

10:31.209 --> 10:32.042
>> John: OKAY, SO THAT IS JUST

10:32.126 --> 10:33.042
CLEARLY BULLSHIT, UNLESS TRUMP

10:33.126 --> 10:34.834
SIMPLY FORGOT THE MAN WHO

10:34.917 --> 10:35.125
HE APPOINTED ACTING

10:35.208 --> 10:36.000
ATTORNEY GENERAL IS NAMED

10:36.083 --> 10:39.834
"MATT WHITAKER," WHICH IS NOT

10:39.917 --> 10:40.458
IMPOSSIBLE.

10:40.542 --> 10:41.542
AFTER ALL, HE DOES LOOK MORE

10:41.625 --> 10:42.709
LIKE HIS NAME WOULD BE

10:42.792 --> 10:43.458
"DORG BLUNDERBUSS" OR

10:43.542 --> 10:44.583
"CHUNK SMUSHINGTON."

10:44.667 --> 10:45.333
LOOK, WE'VE KNOWN FOR MORE THAN

10:45.417 --> 10:46.750
A YEAR NOW THAT TRUMP WANTED TO

10:46.834 --> 10:47.959
REPLACE SESSIONS WITH SOMEONE

10:48.042 --> 10:49.083
WHO WILL RESTRAIN MUELLER.

10:49.166 --> 10:50.625
AND THIS WEEK, HE DID IT.

10:50.709 --> 10:51.667
SO THE ONLY REALLY REMAINING

10:51.750 --> 10:53.000
QUESTION HERE IS, HOW WILL WE

10:53.083 --> 10:57.500
RESPOND?

10:57.583 --> 10:58.208
WILL CONGRESS TAKE STEPS TO KEEP

10:58.291 --> 10:59.291
MUELLER SAFE?

10:59.375 --> 11:05.125
I WOULD HOPE SO.

11:05.208 --> 11:06.959
BECAUSE IT IS PRETTY CLEAR BY

11:07.042 --> 11:07.875
NOW TRUMP WILL GO EXACTLY AS FAR

11:07.959 --> 11:08.709
AS WE ALLOW HIM TO GO.

11:08.792 --> 11:09.667
THAT IS UNDENIABLE.

11:09.750 --> 11:10.166
IN FACT, THE ONLY THING THAT

11:10.250 --> 11:11.250
MIGHT BE MORE UNDENIABLE IS THE

11:11.333 --> 11:12.834
SWEETNESS OF THIS PEACH.

11:12.917 --> 11:15.709
AND NOW THIS.

11:15.792 --> 11:17.083
>> Announcer: AND NOW,

11:17.166 --> 11:19.001

HEY, JIM?

11:32.375 --> 11:37.125

11:37.208 --> 11:38.834
DID HE PICK UP?

11:38.917 --> 11:45.542
TELL US WHAT'S GOING ON THERE.

11:45.625 --> 11:46.834
>> YEAH, WELL...

12:13.417 --> 12:14.083
EXCUSE ME.

12:14.166 --> 12:17.041
WE COULD GET WHAT WE WANTED.

12:17.041 --> 12:17.209
WE COULD GET WHAT WE WANTED.
>> [COUGHING]

12:17.209 --> 12:17.667
>> [COUGHING]

12:17.750 --> 12:18.417
WE STILL HAVE SOMETHING BEFORE

12:18.500 --> 12:19.709
THAT.

12:19.792 --> 12:20.417
>> HERE'S MIKE.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.542

12:21.625 --> 12:22.750

12:22.834 --> 12:23.792
YEAH, I HEAR YOU, STEVE.

12:23.875 --> 12:26.166

12:29.000 --> 12:29.167
>> NO, YOU STAY.
YOU ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

12:29.167 --> 12:31.208
YOU ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

12:31.291 --> 12:32.625
RIGHT THERE.

12:32.709 --> 12:33.250
NO.

12:33.333 --> 12:35.126
I'M PRODUCING.

12:35.209 --> 12:36.083
>> John: MOVING ON.

12:36.166 --> 12:37.125
SO OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT

12:37.208 --> 12:38.250
CONCERNS DONALD TRUMP, A MAN

12:38.333 --> 12:39.667
WHOSE PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY COULD

12:39.750 --> 12:40.625
CONCEIVABLY EXHIBIT A

12:40.709 --> 12:47.042
RAZZIE AWARD.

12:47.126 --> 12:47.625
SERIOUSLY, HE WON A RAZZIE IN

12:47.709 --> 12:48.500
1991 FOR HIS SUPPORTING ROLE IN

12:48.583 --> 12:49.458
THE FILM "GHOSTS CAN'T DO IT" AS

12:49.542 --> 12:51.041
A BUSINESSMAN NEGOTIATING WITH

12:51.041 --> 12:51.209
A BUSINESSMAN NEGOTIATING WITH
BO DEREK.

12:51.209 --> 12:54.917
BO DEREK.

12:55.001 --> 12:55.917
>> IN THIS ROOM, THERE ARE

12:56.001 --> 12:56.750
KNIVES SHARP ENOUGH TO CUT YOU

12:56.834 --> 12:58.084
TO THE BONE AND HEARTS COLD

12:58.167 --> 12:59.000
ENOUGH TO EAT YOURS AS

12:59.083 --> 13:00.542
HORS D'OEUVRES.

13:00.625 --> 13:03.291
>> YOU'RE TOO PRETTY TO BE BAD.

13:03.375 --> 13:06.709
>> YOU NOTICED.

13:06.792 --> 13:08.875
>> John: [GROANS]

13:08.959 --> 13:12.083
THAT KISSY FACE IS THE

13:12.166 --> 13:13.667
SINGLE-MOST DISGUSTING THING

13:13.750 --> 13:16.792
THAT HAS EVER BEEN IN A MOVIE,

13:16.875 --> 13:17.750
AND I'M VERY MUCH INCLUDING THE

13:17.834 --> 13:18.583
HUMAN CENTIPEDE.

13:18.667 --> 13:19.792
BUT, LOOK, WE'RE NOT GOING TO

13:19.875 --> 13:20.333
TALK ABOUT TRUMP'S MOVIE CAREER

13:20.417 --> 13:21.000
TONIGHT.

13:21.083 --> 13:22.291
INSTEAD, WE WANT TO FOCUS ON THE

13:22.375 --> 13:23.042
TWO-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF ONE OF

13:23.126 --> 13:25.042
HIS SIGNATURE CAMPAIGN PROMISES.

13:25.126 --> 13:26.041
>> WE ARE GOING TO DRAIN THE

13:26.125 --> 13:30.542
SWAMP IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

13:30.625 --> 13:31.542
IT'S TIME TO DRAIN THE SWAMP OF

13:31.625 --> 13:32.875
CORRUPTION.

13:32.959 --> 13:33.625
DRAIN THE SWAMP!

13:33.709 --> 13:34.834
LOOK AT THAT SIGN.

13:34.917 --> 13:36.084
DRAIN THE SWAMP.

13:36.167 --> 13:37.208
WE'RE GONNA DRAIN THE SWAMP OF

13:37.291 --> 13:39.041
WASHINGTON.

13:39.041 --> 13:39.209
WASHINGTON.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN DOING IT,

13:39.209 --> 13:40.375
WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN DOING IT,

13:40.458 --> 13:42.583
AND WE'RE ALL DOING IT TOGETHER.

13:42.667 --> 13:43.792
>> John: "WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN

13:43.875 --> 13:44.792
DOING IT, AND WE'RE ALL DOING IT

13:44.875 --> 13:46.166
TOGETHER" SOUNDS LESS LIKE A

13:46.250 --> 13:47.000
CAMPAIGN PROMISE AND MORE LIKE A

13:47.083 --> 13:48.084
NERVOUS HOST RAMBLING THROUGH

13:48.167 --> 13:48.959
THE INTRODUCTION OF THEIR

13:49.042 --> 13:50.667
FIRST-EVER ORGY.

13:50.750 --> 13:51.917
[VOICE CRACKING]

13:52.001 --> 13:52.750
"SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN DOING

13:52.834 --> 13:53.667
IT, AND WE'RE ALL DOING IT

13:53.750 --> 13:54.375
TOGETHER.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.041
AND THANKS FOR THE HUMMUS

13:55.041 --> 13:55.167
AND THANKS FOR THE HUMMUS
SPREAD, TOM.

13:55.167 --> 13:55.959
SPREAD, TOM.

13:56.042 --> 13:56.500
OH, SHIT, WE SAID NO NAMES,

13:56.583 --> 14:00.792
DIDN'T WE?

14:00.875 --> 14:01.625
UH, DOMINE, DOMINE, DOMINE,

14:01.709 --> 14:03.542
EVERYBODY FUCK NOW.

14:03.625 --> 14:04.166
BEHIND THE COFFEE TABLE."

14:04.250 --> 14:05.083
AND, LOOK, LIMITING THE POWER OF

14:05.166 --> 14:06.166
INDUSTRY LOBBYISTS AND SPECIAL

14:06.250 --> 14:07.084
INTERESTS IS A GOOD IDEA.

14:07.167 --> 14:08.166
AND WHILE I'D LOVE TO GIVE HIM

14:08.250 --> 14:09.125
CREDIT, ODDS ARE, IF YOUR WHOLE

14:09.208 --> 14:10.834
POLITICAL PLATFORM IS SCREAMING

14:10.917 --> 14:12.417
RANDOM THREE-WORD PHRASES, ONE

14:12.500 --> 14:16.042
OF THEM IS BOUND TO BE GOOD.

14:16.126 --> 14:17.291
"LOCK HER UP," NO.

14:17.375 --> 14:20.125
"BUILD THE WALL," NO.

14:20.208 --> 14:20.667
"ALL-DOG ZOO," STOP.

14:20.750 --> 14:21.625
THAT'S ACTUALLY A GREAT IDEA.

14:21.709 --> 14:22.792
IT TOOK A WHILE, BUT YOU FINALLY

14:22.875 --> 14:26.458
THREW OUT A GOOD ONE.

14:26.542 --> 14:28.500
AND WHILE TRUMP BY NO MEANS CAME

14:28.583 --> 14:29.458
UP WITH THE PHRASE, IT CLEARLY

14:29.542 --> 14:30.709
CAUGHT ON AFTER HE WON, BECAUSE

14:30.792 --> 14:32.126
OTHER CANDIDATES BEGAN USING IT,

14:32.209 --> 14:33.000
PERHAPS NONE MORE MEMORABLY OR

14:33.083 --> 14:35.917
LITERALLY THAN THIS GUY.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.458
>> I'M BOB GRAY, AN OUTSIDER AND

14:37.542 --> 14:40.000
A BUSINESSMAN.

14:40.000 --> 14:40.167
A BUSINESSMAN.
I'M RUNNING TO FUEL THE ECONOMY,

14:40.167 --> 14:41.500
I'M RUNNING TO FUEL THE ECONOMY,

14:41.583 --> 14:43.875
CHOKE OFF WASTEFUL SPENDING, AND

14:43.959 --> 14:45.625
SECURE OUR NATION.

14:45.709 --> 14:47.667
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, I PROMISE

14:47.750 --> 14:49.333
TO DRAIN THE SWAMP.

14:49.417 --> 14:51.000
I'M BOB GRAY, CONSERVATIVE

14:51.083 --> 14:52.250
REPUBLICAN, AND I APPROVE THIS

14:52.333 --> 14:55.084
MESSAGE.

14:55.167 --> 14:56.417
>> John: RIGHT, EXCEPT YOU'RE

14:56.500 --> 14:57.792
NOT REALLY DRAINING THE SWAMP SO

14:57.875 --> 14:59.417
MUCH AS YOU ARE MOVING IT A

14:59.500 --> 15:01.750
COUPLE OF FEET OFF CAMERA.

15:01.834 --> 15:07.125
AND "SCOOCH THE SWAMP" JUST

15:07.208 --> 15:08.875
DOESN'T QUITE HAVE THE SAME RING

15:08.959 --> 15:09.500
TO IT, DOES IT?

15:09.583 --> 15:10.917
BUT AS MUCH AS PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN

15:11.001 --> 15:11.375
TO TRUMP'S "DRAIN THE SWAMP"

15:11.458 --> 15:12.042
PROMISE, IT WON'T REMOTELY

15:12.126 --> 15:12.917
SURPRISE YOU TO KNOW THAT HE HAS

15:13.001 --> 15:13.709
NOT DRAINED THE SWAMP EVEN ONE

15:13.792 --> 15:14.625
LITTLE BIT.

15:14.709 --> 15:16.001
HIS CABINET HAS INCLUDED MANY

15:16.084 --> 15:16.917
SWAMP CREATURES, FROM THESE TWO

15:17.001 --> 15:18.041
GOLDMAN SACHS VETERANS WORKING

15:18.125 --> 15:19.583
ON TAX POLICY -- GARY COHN AND

15:19.667 --> 15:20.875
CERTIFIED HANDFUL OF MAN-CANDY

15:20.959 --> 15:22.166
STEVE MNUCHIN -- TO WILBUR ROSS,

15:22.250 --> 15:24.125
COMMERCE SECRETARY, WEALTHY

15:24.208 --> 15:26.126
CORPORATE RAIDER, AND LIVING

15:26.209 --> 15:28.126
WORST-CASE SCENARIO OF WHAT CAN

15:28.209 --> 15:29.126
HAPPEN WHEN WALLACE SHAWN IS NOT

15:29.209 --> 15:31.041
STORED AT THE PROPER

15:31.041 --> 15:31.209
STORED AT THE PROPER
TEMPERATURE.

15:31.209 --> 15:33.458
TEMPERATURE.

15:33.542 --> 15:35.041
NOW, TRUMP HAS A LAUGHABLE

15:35.125 --> 15:36.875
NUMBER OF WEALTHY BUSINESSMEN

15:36.959 --> 15:38.000
PRESIDING OVER POLICIES THAT

15:38.000 --> 15:38.167
PRESIDING OVER POLICIES THAT
COULD DIRECTLY BENEFIT

15:38.167 --> 15:39.625
COULD DIRECTLY BENEFIT

15:39.709 --> 15:41.001
THEMSELVES AND THEIR FORMER

15:41.084 --> 15:42.000
EMPLOYERS.

15:42.000 --> 15:42.167
EMPLOYERS.
AND INCREDIBLY, DESPITE

15:42.167 --> 15:42.959
AND INCREDIBLY, DESPITE

15:43.042 --> 15:44.001
"DRAIN THE SWAMP" BEING ONE OF

15:44.084 --> 15:45.250
TRUMP'S GREATEST HITS AT HIS

15:45.333 --> 15:46.625
RALLIES, MANY OF HIS SUPPORTERS

15:46.709 --> 15:48.208
DO NOT SEEM TROUBLED BY THIS.

15:48.291 --> 15:50.000
>> THE SWAMP IS HORRIBLE, AND

15:50.083 --> 15:52.291
TRUMP IS THERE.

15:52.375 --> 15:53.959
HE'S THERE FOR THE SMALL GUY.

15:54.042 --> 15:55.001
HE'S THERE FOR PEOPLE LIKE

15:55.084 --> 15:56.250
MYSELF.

15:56.333 --> 15:59.084
>> THOUGH HIS CABINET IS FILLED

15:59.167 --> 15:59.917
WITH MULTIMILLIONAIRES.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.042
>> I LOVE THAT.

16:01.126 --> 16:01.834
THEY'RE NOT POLITICIANS.

16:01.917 --> 16:03.000
>> AND YOU DON'T SEE THEM AS

16:03.000 --> 16:03.167
>> AND YOU DON'T SEE THEM AS
PART OF THE SWAMP WHO HAVE

16:03.167 --> 16:04.125
PART OF THE SWAMP WHO HAVE

16:04.208 --> 16:05.041
CAPITALIZED ON THE SYSTEM.

16:05.125 --> 16:06.875
>> NOT AT ALL.

16:06.959 --> 16:08.583
IN A CAPITALIST SYSTEM, YOU'RE

16:08.667 --> 16:10.875
ALLOWED TO MAKE MONEY.

16:10.959 --> 16:11.875
BEING RICH IS GOOD.

16:11.959 --> 16:12.834
>> YEAH.

16:12.917 --> 16:14.166
SO THEN WHAT IS THE SWAMP?

16:14.250 --> 16:15.834
>> THE SWAMP, FOR ME --

16:15.917 --> 16:17.084
>> THE MAINSTREAM.

16:17.167 --> 16:18.333
>> IS, YES, YOU ALMOST NAILED

16:18.417 --> 16:19.291
IT.

16:19.375 --> 16:20.583
IT'S THE MAINSTREAM, IT'S THE

16:20.667 --> 16:22.126
ELITE THAT LOOK DOWN ON A SMALL

16:22.209 --> 16:24.583
GUY LIKE MYSELF.

16:24.667 --> 16:25.834
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, IF YOU'RE

16:25.917 --> 16:27.709
MAINSTREAM, YOU CAN'T BE ELITE.

16:27.792 --> 16:28.959
BY DEFINITION, ELITES ARE A

16:29.042 --> 16:30.042
SELECT GROUP SUPERIOR TO THE

16:30.126 --> 16:31.001
MAINSTREAM.

16:31.084 --> 16:32.166
THOSE TERMS ARE MUTUALLY

16:32.250 --> 16:33.083
EXCLUSIVE.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.000
DIGGING INTO THIS LOGICAL

16:34.083 --> 16:35.166
FALLACY MAKES ME SOUND LIKE AN

16:35.250 --> 16:36.458
ELITIST ASSHOLE; IT DOES NOT

16:36.542 --> 16:37.583
MAKE ME SOUND LIKE A MAINSTREAM

16:37.667 --> 16:39.041
ASSHOLE.

16:39.041 --> 16:39.209
ASSHOLE.
DO YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?

16:39.209 --> 16:43.291
DO YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?

16:43.375 --> 16:45.000
BUT SECOND, AND PERHAPS MOST

16:45.083 --> 16:48.875
IMPORTANTLY, THE NARROW QUESTION

16:48.959 --> 16:49.792
OF SELF-ENRICHMENT IS ONLY PART

16:49.875 --> 16:50.583
OF WHY THE SWAMP IS A PROBLEM.

16:50.667 --> 16:52.542
A MUCH BIGGER ISSUE IS THE HARM

16:52.625 --> 16:53.792
THAT IT CAN ACTUALLY DO, AND

16:53.875 --> 16:54.917
THAT'S WHAT OUR STORY IS ABOUT

16:55.001 --> 16:56.750
TONIGHT.

16:56.834 --> 16:58.083
BECAUSE REAL DAMAGE IS BEING

16:58.166 --> 16:59.625
DONE TO THE SMALL GUY BY THIS

16:59.709 --> 17:00.750
ADMINISTRATION'S ACTIONS.

17:00.834 --> 17:03.001
TAKE PAYDAY LENDING.

17:03.084 --> 17:04.208
AS WE'VE DISCUSSED ON THIS SHOW,

17:04.291 --> 17:09.000
PEOPLE'S LIVES CAN BE DESTROYED

17:09.083 --> 17:10.126
BY MISLEADINGLY MARKETED

17:10.209 --> 17:11.042
HIGH-INTEREST LOANS.

17:11.126 --> 17:11.667
BUT THE NEW ACTING HEAD OF THE

17:11.750 --> 17:12.458
CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION

17:12.542 --> 17:13.750
BUREAU, MICK MULVANEY, HAS BEEN

17:13.834 --> 17:14.667
ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE

17:14.750 --> 17:16.959
PAYDAY LOAN INDUSTRY TO BLOCK

17:17.042 --> 17:17.834
RULES REINING THEM IN.

17:17.917 --> 17:18.542
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

17:18.625 --> 17:19.500
I DON'T KNOW.

17:19.583 --> 17:20.709
WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT, AS A

17:20.792 --> 17:21.875
CONGRESSMAN, HE GOT $60,000 IN

17:21.959 --> 17:23.125
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM

17:23.208 --> 17:24.750
PAYDAY-LENDING INTERESTS.

17:24.834 --> 17:26.042
AND EARLIER THIS YEAR, HE TOLD A

17:26.126 --> 17:28.001
ROOMFUL OF BANKERS THIS AMUSING

17:28.084 --> 17:30.834
ANECDOTE:

17:30.917 --> 17:31.875
>> "WE HAD A HIERARCHY IN MY

17:31.959 --> 17:33.166
OFFICE IN CONGRESS.

17:33.250 --> 17:34.333
IF YOU'RE A LOBBYIST WHO NEVER

17:34.417 --> 17:35.250
GAVE US MONEY, I DIDN'T TALK TO

17:35.333 --> 17:36.667
YOU.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.083
IF YOU'RE A LOBBYIST WHO GAVE US

17:38.166 --> 17:40.083
MONEY, I MIGHT TALK TO YOU."

17:40.166 --> 17:41.458
NOW, HE DID SAY HE WOULD ALWAYS

17:41.542 --> 17:42.625
TALK TO CONSTITUENTS WHETHER

17:42.709 --> 17:44.042
THEY GAVE HIM MONEY OR NOT.

17:44.126 --> 17:48.083
BUT THE FACT, MOLLY, HE'S

17:48.166 --> 17:49.042
ADMITTING THAT, AS A LOBBYIST,

17:49.126 --> 17:49.625
MONEY MIGHT GET YOU A MEETING.

17:49.709 --> 17:51.042
YOU DON'T OFTEN HEAR THAT FROM A

17:51.126 --> 17:51.625
POLITICIAN.

17:51.709 --> 17:53.667
>> John: YEAH, YOU DON'T.

17:53.750 --> 17:57.375
IT'S SOMETHING EVERYONE ASSUMES,

17:57.458 --> 17:58.083
BUT IT'S WEIRD TO HEAR

17:58.166 --> 17:59.084
OUT LOUD.

17:59.167 --> 18:00.125
IT'S LIKE A DISNEY WORLD PARK

18:00.208 --> 18:00.875
ATTENDANT SAYING, "HEY, KIDS,

18:00.959 --> 18:01.375
WHO WANTS TO HAVE THEIR PHOTO

18:01.458 --> 18:02.875
TAKEN WITH A 30-YEAR OLD THEATER

18:02.959 --> 18:03.625
MAJOR WHO COULDN'T HACK IT IN

18:03.709 --> 18:04.625
THE INDUSTRY AND WHO NOW WEARS A

18:04.709 --> 18:06.000
FULL-BODY MOUSE SUIT?"

18:06.083 --> 18:07.709
I MEAN, THERE'S NO NEW

18:07.792 --> 18:08.458
INFORMATION THERE, BUT IT IS

18:08.542 --> 18:10.084
STILL UNPLEASANT TO LISTEN TO.

18:10.167 --> 18:11.542
BUT JUST FOCUSING ON THE FAMOUS

18:11.625 --> 18:13.083
ALLIGATORS IN TRUMP'S SWAMP IS

18:13.166 --> 18:14.834
MISSING SOME OF THE MOST

18:14.917 --> 18:16.625
IMPORTANT DAMAGE THAT'S GETTING

18:16.709 --> 18:17.834
DONE BY LESSER-KNOWN

18:17.917 --> 18:18.917
BUREAUCRATS.

18:19.001 --> 18:20.126
AND TO ILLUSTRATE THAT, LET'S

18:20.209 --> 18:21.166
LOOK AT TWO AGENCIES TONIGHT.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.709
FIRST, THE EPA.

18:22.792 --> 18:24.041
NOW, FOR A YEAR, IT WAS RUN BY

18:24.125 --> 18:25.000
SCOTT PRUITT, WHO BECAME A

18:25.000 --> 18:25.167
SCOTT PRUITT, WHO BECAME A
HOUSEHOLD NAME FOR DOING THINGS

18:25.167 --> 18:26.166
HOUSEHOLD NAME FOR DOING THINGS

18:26.250 --> 18:27.792
LIKE SPENDING $40,000 ON A

18:27.875 --> 18:29.083
SOUNDPROOF BOOTH IN HIS OFFICE,

18:29.166 --> 18:31.084
TRYING TO GET THE CEO OF

18:31.167 --> 18:32.126
CHICK-FIL-A TO GIVE HIS WIFE A

18:32.209 --> 18:35.042
FRANCHISE, AND DEMANDING AN

18:35.126 --> 18:37.291
EXPENSIVE 24/7 SECURITY DETAIL,

18:37.375 --> 18:39.042
THEN MAKING IT DRIVE HIM AROUND

18:39.126 --> 18:40.166
TOWN SEE WHICH RITZ CARLTON HAD

18:40.250 --> 18:42.792
THE LOTION HE LIKED, WHICH IS

18:42.875 --> 18:44.166
INSANE, BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS

18:44.250 --> 18:45.625
THE BEST LOTION COMES FROM

18:45.709 --> 18:47.001
LA QUINTA INN.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.542
THAT'S RIGHT.

18:48.625 --> 18:50.041
IF YOU WANT TO MASTURBATE WITH

18:50.041 --> 18:50.209
IF YOU WANT TO MASTURBATE WITH
HOTEL LOTION, CHOOSE LA QUINTA.

18:50.209 --> 18:52.041
HOTEL LOTION, CHOOSE LA QUINTA.

18:52.041 --> 18:52.209
HOTEL LOTION, CHOOSE LA QUINTA.
IT'S LIKE THEIR SLOGAN SAYS:

18:52.209 --> 18:53.208
IT'S LIKE THEIR SLOGAN SAYS:

18:53.291 --> 18:54.709
LA QUINTA HAS THE LOTION THAT

18:54.792 --> 18:56.041
WILL HELP YOU JIZZ.

18:56.041 --> 18:56.209
WILL HELP YOU JIZZ.
NOW, ONCE PRUITT LEFT, THERE

18:56.209 --> 18:59.625
NOW, ONCE PRUITT LEFT, THERE

18:59.709 --> 19:01.208
WERE NOT AS MANY FLASHY

19:01.291 --> 19:02.959
HEADLINES ABOUT THE EPA.

19:03.042 --> 19:05.291
BUT THAT ITSELF IS ACTUALLY

19:05.375 --> 19:07.583
DANGEROUS, BECAUSE HE WAS NOT AN

19:07.667 --> 19:08.458
ISOLATED CASE.

19:08.542 --> 19:09.917
NEARLY HALF OF THE POLITICAL

19:10.001 --> 19:12.042
APPOINTEES HIRED BY TRUMP AT THE

19:12.126 --> 19:13.125
EPA HAVE STRONG INDUSTRY TIES,

19:13.208 --> 19:14.583
AND THE GUY WHO REPLACED

19:14.667 --> 19:15.083
PRUITT IS NOT MUCH OF AN

19:15.166 --> 19:16.417
IMPROVEMENT.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.375
>> THE MAN TAPPED TO BE PRUITT'S

19:17.458 --> 19:24.042
REPLACEMENT?

19:24.126 --> 19:24.750
ANDREW WHEELER, A MAN WHO

19:24.834 --> 19:25.625
"FORBES" SAYS EARNED

19:25.709 --> 19:26.792
MORE THAN $700,000 IN RECENT

19:26.875 --> 19:27.750
YEARS AS -- WAIT FOR IT --

19:27.834 --> 19:29.625
A COAL LOBBYIST.

19:29.709 --> 19:32.000
>> John: YEAH, AT THIS POINT,

19:32.000 --> 19:32.167
>> John: YEAH, AT THIS POINT,
CNN, YOU REALLY DON'T NEED TO

19:32.167 --> 19:34.042
CNN, YOU REALLY DON'T NEED TO

19:34.126 --> 19:35.375
ASK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO "WAIT

19:35.458 --> 19:36.041
FOR IT."

19:36.125 --> 19:37.375
SURPRISE IS JUST ONE MORE

19:37.458 --> 19:38.084
EMOTION THAT TRUMP HAS

19:38.167 --> 19:38.875
COMPLETELY DESTROYED, ALONG

19:38.959 --> 19:40.166
WITH JOY, WONDER, AND THE

19:40.250 --> 19:40.959
ABILITY TO SEE SOMEONE WEARING A

19:41.042 --> 19:42.083
RED HAT FROM BEHIND WITHOUT

19:42.166 --> 19:45.834
MENTALLY SAYING "GOD DAMN IT."

19:45.917 --> 19:49.084
NOW, AS A COAL LOBBYIST, WHEELER

19:49.167 --> 19:50.667
PUSHED HARD TO ROLL BACK

19:50.750 --> 19:52.126
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

19:52.209 --> 19:57.417
IMPACTING THE INDUSTRY.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.208
IN FACT, HERE HE IS AS A

19:58.291 --> 19:59.333
LOBBYIST MEETING WITH

19:59.417 --> 20:00.126
RICK PERRY, DOING EXACTLY THAT.

20:00.209 --> 20:01.125
AND A LITTLE OVER A YEAR LATER,

20:01.208 --> 20:02.917
HE'S RUNNING THE EPA AND

20:03.001 --> 20:03.458
DISMANTLING THE VERY REGULATIONS

20:03.542 --> 20:05.041
HE LOBBIED AGAINST, WHICH IS

20:05.041 --> 20:05.209
HE LOBBIED AGAINST, WHICH IS
RIDICULOUS.

20:05.209 --> 20:07.959
RIDICULOUS.

20:08.042 --> 20:09.208
IT'S LIKE HANDING YOUR CITY'S

20:09.291 --> 20:10.417
WASTE MANAGEMENT OVER TO A

20:10.500 --> 20:11.834
SEAGULL.

20:11.917 --> 20:13.000
"SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

20:13.000 --> 20:13.167
"SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
THE NEW STRATEGY IS, WE JUST

20:13.167 --> 20:13.959
THE NEW STRATEGY IS, WE JUST

20:14.042 --> 20:14.625
THROW OUR TRASH EVERYWHERE AND

20:14.709 --> 20:17.750
LEAVE IT STREWN AROUND?

20:17.834 --> 20:18.917
AND WE SHOULD HAVE MORE

20:19.001 --> 20:20.208
FRENCH FRIES IN OUR TRASH?

20:20.291 --> 20:24.625
HOW THE FUCK ARE YOU IN CHARGE?"

20:24.709 --> 20:25.458
BUT WHEELER IS ACTUALLY A GOOD

20:25.542 --> 20:27.126
EXAMPLE OF HOW, ONCE TRUMP'S

20:27.209 --> 20:27.667
SWAMP STARTS SEEPING IN, IT CAN

20:27.750 --> 20:28.625
FILTER ALL THE WAY DOWN AN

20:28.709 --> 20:31.126
ORGANIZATION.

20:31.209 --> 20:31.917
AND FOR JUST HOW DEEP IT CAN GO,

20:32.001 --> 20:32.959
JUST LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

20:33.042 --> 20:35.042
THE INTERIOR.

20:35.126 --> 20:36.042
ON THIS SHOW, WE'VE LAVISHED

20:36.126 --> 20:37.000
QUITE A BIT OF ATTENTION ON

20:37.083 --> 20:38.750
TRUMP'S APPOINTEE TO HEAD THEM,

20:38.834 --> 20:39.667
RYAN ZINKE, WHICH IS

20:39.750 --> 20:41.042
UNDERSTANDABLE.

20:41.126 --> 20:42.792
HE RODE A HORSE TO WORK ON HIS

20:42.875 --> 20:43.625
FIRST DAY AT THE DEPARTMENT.

20:43.709 --> 20:44.625
HE SWUNG KAREN PENCE AROUND LIKE

20:44.709 --> 20:45.125
A BAG OF POTATOES.

20:45.208 --> 20:46.709
AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE IS

20:46.792 --> 20:47.375
VERY MUCH NOT A GEOLOGIST, HE

20:47.458 --> 20:53.333
HAS A WEIRD HABIT OF DOING THIS:

20:53.417 --> 20:54.126
>> THAT'S THE QUESTION.

20:54.209 --> 20:55.042
I'M A GEOLOGIST.

20:55.126 --> 20:55.417
I'M A GEOLOGIST.

20:55.500 --> 20:56.291
I'M A GEOLOGIST.

20:56.375 --> 20:57.250
I'M A GEOLOGIST.

20:57.333 --> 20:58.375
I'M A GEOLOGIST.

20:58.458 --> 20:59.375
I'M A GEOLOGIST.

20:59.458 --> 21:00.166
>> John: HE'S NOT A GEOLOGIST

21:00.250 --> 21:01.625
AT ALL!

21:01.709 --> 21:02.750
BESIDES, BRAGGING ABOUT BEING A

21:02.834 --> 21:04.917
GEOLOGIST IS A VERY WEIRD BOAST.

21:05.001 --> 21:07.166
IT'S JUST BEHIND WALKING AROUND

21:07.250 --> 21:08.959
SAYING, "I OWN CRACKERS.

21:09.042 --> 21:10.126
SALTINES, CHEEZ-ITS.

21:10.209 --> 21:11.208
YOU NAME IT, I OWN IT.

21:11.291 --> 21:12.500
NOT OYSTER CRACKERS, OF COURSE.

21:12.583 --> 21:14.041
WHO AM I, BILL GATES?"

21:14.125 --> 21:17.000
ZINKE HAS ALSO TAKEN 66 PERSONAL

21:17.000 --> 21:17.167
ZINKE HAS ALSO TAKEN 66 PERSONAL
DAYS IN HIS FIRST YEAR AND A

21:17.167 --> 21:19.333
DAYS IN HIS FIRST YEAR AND A

21:19.417 --> 21:20.417
HALF ON THE JOB AND

21:20.500 --> 21:21.709
HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF NO LESS

21:21.792 --> 21:23.542
THAN 15 INVESTIGATIONS.

21:23.625 --> 21:24.041
AND REPORTEDLY, HE MAY BE GONE

21:24.125 --> 21:25.126
ANY DAY NOW.

21:25.209 --> 21:26.083
BUT EVEN IF THAT HAPPENS,

21:26.166 --> 21:27.709
SERIOUS PROBLEMS WILL REMAIN,

21:27.792 --> 21:29.333
BECAUSE THE SWAMP RUNS DEEP.

21:29.417 --> 21:30.542
INTERIOR IS A MASSIVE

21:30.625 --> 21:32.166
DEPARTMENT, AND THERE'S REAL

21:32.250 --> 21:33.709
POWER AT EVERY LEVEL.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.000
I'LL SHOW YOU.

21:35.000 --> 21:35.167
I'LL SHOW YOU.
LOOK AT THIS ORGANIZATIONAL

21:35.167 --> 21:37.500
LOOK AT THIS ORGANIZATIONAL

21:37.583 --> 21:39.208
CHART.

21:39.291 --> 21:40.000
BELOW ZINKE AND THE DEPUTY

21:40.083 --> 21:41.250
SECRETARY AND THE ASSISTANT

21:41.333 --> 21:44.542
SECRETARY FOR LAND AND MINERALS

21:44.625 --> 21:46.126
MANAGEMENT, YOU'LL FIND THERE A

21:46.209 --> 21:48.001
VERY IMPORTANT SUB-DIVISION

21:48.084 --> 21:48.542
CALLED THE BUREAU OF SAFETY AND

21:48.625 --> 21:49.041
ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT,

21:49.041 --> 21:49.209
ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT,
OR "BESSIE," WHICH IS IN CHARGE

21:49.209 --> 21:50.417
OR "BESSIE," WHICH IS IN CHARGE

21:50.500 --> 21:51.041
OF SAFETY ON OFFSHORE OIL RIGS.

21:51.041 --> 21:51.209
OF SAFETY ON OFFSHORE OIL RIGS.
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING:

21:51.209 --> 21:51.750
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING:

21:51.834 --> 21:52.959
SAFETY ON OFFSHORE OIL RIGS?

21:53.042 --> 21:54.084
WOULDN'T REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF

21:54.167 --> 21:55.084
ANY RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT ON THE

21:55.167 --> 21:56.001
OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF FALL

21:56.084 --> 21:56.500
UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE

21:56.583 --> 21:57.750
MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE?

21:57.834 --> 22:04.042
[SNICKERING]

22:04.126 --> 22:05.084
WOULDN'T THAT BE WHY THE

22:05.167 --> 22:09.126
RESPONSIBILITY LIES, JOHN?

22:09.209 --> 22:10.250
TO WHICH I SAY, CONGRATULATIONS

22:10.333 --> 22:12.834
ON BEING A SEX GOD.

22:12.917 --> 22:13.667
AND THE MINERALS MANAGEMENT

22:13.750 --> 22:14.667
SERVICE ACTUALLY USED TO BE IN

22:14.750 --> 22:15.834
CHARGE OF SAFETY UNTIL 2010 WHEN

22:15.917 --> 22:16.291
THERE WAS A CATASTROPHE AT

22:16.375 --> 22:17.000
DEEPWATER HORIZON.

22:17.083 --> 22:18.333
>> THIS IS THE VIDEO BP DID NOT

22:18.417 --> 22:23.083
WANT THE WORLD TO SEE.

22:23.166 --> 22:24.126
A TOXIC BLEND OF OIL AND GAS

22:24.209 --> 22:25.125
SPEWING FROM ITS BROKEN WELL AT

22:25.208 --> 22:26.001
THE BOTTOM OF THE GULF OF

22:26.084 --> 22:26.750
MEXICO.

22:26.834 --> 22:27.959
>> John: YES, THE DEEPWATER

22:28.042 --> 22:29.042
HORIZON FAMOUSLY PUMPED OVER

22:29.126 --> 22:30.542
130 MILLION GALLONS OF OIL INTO

22:30.625 --> 22:31.917
THE GULF OF MEXICO, ABOUT

22:32.001 --> 22:33.542
12 TIMES THE SIZE OF THE

22:33.625 --> 22:35.126
EXXON VALDEZ SPILL, COSTING THE

22:35.209 --> 22:37.458
REGIONS BILLIONS, AND BADLY

22:37.542 --> 22:38.458
HURTING THE FISHING AND TOURISM

22:38.542 --> 22:39.709
INDUSTRIES.

22:39.792 --> 22:40.792
AND YOU KNOW IT WAS A DISASTER

22:40.875 --> 22:42.375
BECAUSE MARK WAHLBERG MADE A

22:42.458 --> 22:44.500
MOVIE ABOUT IT, AND HE USUALLY

22:44.583 --> 22:47.042
CHOOSES TO STAR IN FILMS ABOUT

22:47.126 --> 22:48.417
THE MOST ABSOLUTELY APPALLING

22:48.500 --> 22:49.041
THINGS.

22:49.125 --> 22:50.917
STUFF LIKE TRAGIC SHIPWRECKS,

22:51.001 --> 22:52.000
ACTS OF TERRORISM, AND

22:52.083 --> 22:53.083
MEL GIBSON'S SEAMLESS

22:53.166 --> 22:59.084
REINTEGRATION INTO HOLLYWOOD.

22:59.167 --> 23:00.041
AND YEARS AFTER

23:00.041 --> 23:00.209
AND YEARS AFTER
DEEPWATER HORIZON, THE REGION

23:00.209 --> 23:01.375
DEEPWATER HORIZON, THE REGION

23:01.458 --> 23:03.042
WAS STILL FEELING THE EFFECTS.

23:03.126 --> 23:04.375
>> WHEN THE LITTLE BOATS FISH IN

23:04.458 --> 23:05.875
THIS AREA RIGHT HERE, HALF OF

23:05.959 --> 23:07.125
WHAT THEY CATCH IS DEFORMED.

23:07.208 --> 23:07.792
>> REALLY, HALF?

23:07.875 --> 23:09.041
>> HALF, YEAH.

23:09.125 --> 23:10.084
>> AND WHAT KIND OF

23:10.167 --> 23:11.126
DEFORMITIES?

23:11.209 --> 23:13.250
>> THEY'VE GOT TUMORS ON THEIR

23:13.333 --> 23:14.000
HEAD, LITTLE BUMPS OFF THE

23:14.083 --> 23:14.959
SIDE.

23:15.042 --> 23:16.208
IT'S ALL IN THE GILLS WHERE THEY

23:16.291 --> 23:16.667
BREATHE AT.

23:16.750 --> 23:17.959
YOU SEE THE OIL IN THERE?

23:18.042 --> 23:19.126
>> SO THAT'S OIL IN ITS GILLS?

23:19.209 --> 23:20.625
>> YEAH, IF YOU TAKE THIS SHELL

23:20.709 --> 23:21.625
OFF, YOU CAN PULL THE OIL OUT

23:21.709 --> 23:26.001
AND YOU CAN SMELL IT.

23:26.084 --> 23:26.667
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S HORRIBLE.

23:26.750 --> 23:28.084
NOT ONLY DID THAT SPILL

23:28.167 --> 23:28.792
DEVASTATE AN ECONOMY, IT SOMEHOW

23:28.875 --> 23:29.917
ACTUALLY MANAGED TO MAKE SHRIMP

23:30.001 --> 23:31.000
EVEN MORE DISGUSTING.

23:31.083 --> 23:34.250
AND I HATE SHRIMP.

23:34.333 --> 23:36.417
THEY ARE SLIMY ARMORED ALIEN

23:36.500 --> 23:37.125
BUGS FOR WHOM PROPER PREPARATION

23:37.208 --> 23:38.084
INVOLVES PULLING OUT THEIR

23:38.167 --> 23:38.834
SHIT VEIN.

23:38.917 --> 23:39.375
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH COCKTAIL

23:39.458 --> 23:40.834
SAUCE IN THE WORLD TO ERASE THE

23:40.917 --> 23:42.208
MEMORY OF A SHIT VEIN.

23:42.291 --> 23:43.458
AND YET SOMEHOW, THAT OIL SPILL

23:43.542 --> 23:47.208
MADE THEM EVEN GROSSER.

23:47.291 --> 23:50.001
NOW, BEFORE DEEPWATER HORIZON,

23:50.084 --> 23:50.917
THE MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE

23:51.001 --> 23:51.542
WAS IN CHARGE OF BOTH SAFETY ON

23:51.625 --> 23:52.375
OIL RIGS AND COLLECTING REVENUES

23:52.458 --> 23:53.208
FROM OIL COMPANIES, WHICH WAS

23:53.291 --> 23:54.458
CLEARLY A BAD IDEA, BECAUSE IT

23:54.542 --> 23:56.333
WAS A CLEAR CONFLICT OF

23:56.417 --> 24:04.333
INTEREST.

24:04.417 --> 24:05.375
SO AFTER DEEPWATER, THEY CREATED

24:05.458 --> 24:06.291
BESSIE, AN AGENCY WHOSE ONLY JOB

24:06.375 --> 24:06.959
IS TO KEEP PEOPLE AND THE

24:07.042 --> 24:08.126
ENVIRONMENT SAFE.

24:08.209 --> 24:09.084
THAT IS THEIR SOLE

24:09.167 --> 24:10.458
RESPONSIBILITY.

24:10.542 --> 24:11.458
PROMOTION OF DRILLING IN THE

24:11.542 --> 24:12.083
GULF?

24:12.166 --> 24:13.042
THAT IS SOMEONE ELSE'S JOB.

24:13.126 --> 24:14.001
BESSIE'S IS SAFETY.

24:14.084 --> 24:15.000
THAT IS ALL THEY DO.

24:15.083 --> 24:17.583
THAT IS PROBABLY WHY ITS LAST

24:17.667 --> 24:19.625
TWO HEADS WERE A FORMER

24:19.709 --> 24:21.917
COAST GUARD OFFICER SPECIALIZING

24:22.001 --> 24:23.667
IN MARINE SAFETY AND A FORMER

24:23.750 --> 24:25.417
COAST GUARD OFFICER SPECIALIZING

24:25.500 --> 24:26.000
IN MARINE SAFETY.

24:26.000 --> 24:26.167
IN MARINE SAFETY.
HOWEVER, TRUMP HAS TAKEN A

24:26.167 --> 24:26.917
HOWEVER, TRUMP HAS TAKEN A

24:27.001 --> 24:28.042
DIFFERENT PATH, APPOINTING

24:28.126 --> 24:28.625
SCOTT ANGELLE, FORMER LIEUTENANT

24:28.709 --> 24:29.375
GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA AND A GUY

24:29.458 --> 24:30.834
WHO IS AGGRESSIVELY

24:30.917 --> 24:32.001
PRO-DRILLING.

24:32.084 --> 24:33.000
FOR A SENSE OF HOW AGGRESSIVE,

24:33.000 --> 24:33.167
FOR A SENSE OF HOW AGGRESSIVE,
JUST DAYS AFTER THE DEEPWATER

24:33.167 --> 24:34.125
JUST DAYS AFTER THE DEEPWATER

24:34.208 --> 24:36.042
WELL WAS CAPPED, ANGELLE WAS AT

24:36.126 --> 24:37.166
A RALLY ORGANIZED BY THE

24:37.250 --> 24:39.291
LOUISIANA OIL AND GAS

24:39.375 --> 24:41.001
ASSOCIATION WHERE HE CALLED FOR

24:41.084 --> 24:42.041
AN IMMEDIATE RESUMPTION OF

24:42.125 --> 24:46.083
DEEP-SEA DRILLING, SAYING THIS:

24:46.166 --> 24:48.001
>> ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, AND IT'S

24:48.084 --> 24:50.250
TIME TO QUIT PUNISHING INNOCENT

24:50.333 --> 24:52.625
AMERICAN WORKERS TO ACHIEVE SOME

24:52.709 --> 24:55.041
UNREALISTIC POLITICAL AGENDA.

24:55.041 --> 24:55.209
UNREALISTIC POLITICAL AGENDA.
WHILE WE TOO SUPPORT THE USE OF

24:55.209 --> 24:57.375
WHILE WE TOO SUPPORT THE USE OF

24:57.458 --> 24:59.625
RENEWABLE AND ALTERNATIVE

24:59.709 --> 25:01.041
ENERGY, LET'S KEEP THE

25:01.125 --> 25:02.917
CONVERSATION REAL.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.959
AMERICA IS NOT YET READY TO GET

25:05.042 --> 25:06.083
ALL OF ITS FUEL FROM THE BIRDS

25:06.166 --> 25:07.542
AND THE BEES AND THE FLOWERS AND

25:07.625 --> 25:10.083
THE TREES.

25:10.166 --> 25:11.125
>> John: HOLD ON.

25:11.208 --> 25:12.417
HOLD ON.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.041
AMERICA IS NOT YET READY TO GET

25:14.125 --> 25:15.542
FUEL FROM TREES?

25:15.625 --> 25:16.875
YOU MEAN...

25:16.959 --> 25:18.126
WOOD?

25:18.209 --> 25:19.792
SCIENTISTS HAVE UNDERSTOOD HOW

25:19.875 --> 25:20.917
WOOD WORKS FOR YEARS NOW, MAYBE

25:21.001 --> 25:23.041
EVEN DECADES.

25:23.041 --> 25:23.209
EVEN DECADES.
BUT AFTER SERVING AS

25:23.209 --> 25:29.667
BUT AFTER SERVING AS

25:29.750 --> 25:30.125
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, ANGELLE

25:30.208 --> 25:30.667
JOINED THE BOARD OF

25:30.750 --> 25:31.166
SUNOCO LOGISTICS PARTNERS, AN

25:31.250 --> 25:31.917
OIL PIPELINE COMPANY, EARNING

25:32.001 --> 25:32.333
NEARLY A MILLION DOLLARS.

25:32.417 --> 25:33.126
AND NOW HE'S REGULATING THE OIL

25:33.209 --> 25:34.042
INDUSTRY.

25:34.126 --> 25:35.001
AND IF THERE IS ANY DOUBT ABOUT

25:35.084 --> 25:37.125
HIS PRIORITIES WHICH THERE IS

25:37.208 --> 25:40.333
NOT, JUST WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE

25:40.417 --> 25:41.250
NOT, JUST WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE

25:41.333 --> 25:42.375
SOMETHING WE FOUND ON YOUTUBE.

25:42.458 --> 25:43.667
BECAUSE LAST YEAR, ANGELLE GAVE

25:43.750 --> 25:44.041
A PRESENTATION AT AN

25:44.041 --> 25:44.209
A PRESENTATION AT AN
OIL-INDUSTRY CONFERENCE, WHERE

25:44.209 --> 25:44.834
OIL-INDUSTRY CONFERENCE, WHERE

25:44.917 --> 25:45.792
HE WAS FLANKED BY TWO MEN, ONE

25:45.875 --> 25:46.625
IN A HARD HAT, BOTH OF WHOM WERE

25:46.709 --> 25:48.000
EATING DURING A SIGNIFICANT

25:48.083 --> 25:57.083
PORTION OF HIS SPEECH.

25:57.166 --> 25:58.417
BUT THAT'S NOT THE IMPORTANT

25:58.500 --> 25:59.417
PART.

25:59.500 --> 26:00.041
THE INCREDIBLE MOMENT IS WHEN HE

26:00.041 --> 26:00.209
THE INCREDIBLE MOMENT IS WHEN HE
MAKES IT PAINFULLY CLEAR EXACTLY

26:00.209 --> 26:00.750
MAKES IT PAINFULLY CLEAR EXACTLY

26:00.834 --> 26:01.458
HOW ACCESSIBLE HE -- THE MAN IN

26:01.542 --> 26:02.000
CHARGE OF ENFORCING SAFETY,

26:02.000 --> 26:02.167
CHARGE OF ENFORCING SAFETY,
REMEMBER -- IS WILLING TO BE TO

26:02.167 --> 26:02.959
REMEMBER -- IS WILLING TO BE TO

26:03.042 --> 26:06.959
INDUSTRY LEADERS.

26:07.042 --> 26:08.667
>> MY CELL NUMBER IS -- FOR

26:08.750 --> 26:10.126
ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO GIVE ME A

26:10.209 --> 26:14.042
CALL TO TALK ABOUT IT --

26:14.126 --> 26:16.208
MY CELL NUMBER IS 571-585-3730.

26:16.291 --> 26:21.208
571-585-3730.

26:21.291 --> 26:26.166
I'D RATHER YOU CALL ME.

26:26.250 --> 26:27.959
EVERYTHING YOU TEXT TO ME IS A

26:28.042 --> 26:28.458
PUBLIC RECORD, SO BE CAREFUL.

26:28.542 --> 26:29.417
THIS IS A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY

26:29.500 --> 26:30.000
FOR YOU TO ENGAGE WITH ME ON

26:30.000 --> 26:30.167
FOR YOU TO ENGAGE WITH ME ON
WHAT YOU BELIEVE WE OUGHT TO BE

26:30.167 --> 26:31.333
WHAT YOU BELIEVE WE OUGHT TO BE

26:31.417 --> 26:31.667
ABOUT.

26:31.750 --> 26:32.667
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

26:32.750 --> 26:33.375
HE JUST GAVE OUT HIS WORK

26:33.458 --> 26:34.458
CELL PHONE NUMBER AND ENCOURAGED

26:34.542 --> 26:35.375
OIL BOSSES TO CALL HIM ON IT AS

26:35.458 --> 26:38.458
A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.

26:38.542 --> 26:39.792
THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS FOR TWO

26:39.875 --> 26:40.000
REASONS:

26:40.083 --> 26:41.166
FIRST, BECAUSE HE'S DOING THAT

26:41.250 --> 26:43.084
TO AVOID THE PUBLIC RECORD.

26:43.167 --> 26:44.458
SECOND, NO ONE SHOULD EVER CALL

26:44.542 --> 26:45.125
RATHER THAN TEXT.

26:45.208 --> 26:46.333
I DON'T CARE WHAT THE SCENARIO

26:46.417 --> 26:47.542
IS.

26:47.625 --> 26:48.917
IF YOU PREFER CALLING TO

26:49.001 --> 26:51.041
TEXTING, YOU ARE A PSYCHOPATH,

26:51.125 --> 26:52.208
AND YOU SHOULD BE PUT IN PRISON

26:52.291 --> 26:53.458
FOREVER.

26:53.542 --> 26:55.041
YOU TEXT.

26:55.041 --> 26:55.209
YOU TEXT.
YOU TEXT.

26:55.209 --> 27:00.417
YOU TEXT.

27:00.500 --> 27:01.417
WHATEVER THE SITUATION.

27:01.500 --> 27:02.000
AND THAT'S HIS REAL NUMBER.

27:02.083 --> 27:03.583
WE KNOW BECAUSE WE CALLED IT.

27:03.667 --> 27:04.542
AND APPARENTLY HE GIVES IT OUT

27:04.625 --> 27:05.834
PUBLICLY TO EXECUTIVES ALL THE

27:05.917 --> 27:06.709
TIME.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.125
AT ANOTHER INDUSTRY CONFERENCE,

27:08.208 --> 27:08.834
HE EVEN ANNOUNCED IT FROM A

27:08.917 --> 27:10.001
STAGE.

27:10.084 --> 27:11.208
AND WHO KNOWS WHAT THOSE

27:11.291 --> 27:12.041
EXECUTIVES TELL HIM?

27:12.125 --> 27:13.333
IT'S NOT PART OF THE PUBLIC

27:13.417 --> 27:15.084
RECORD.

27:15.167 --> 27:16.083
BUT BY SHEER COINCIDENCE, HE'S

27:16.166 --> 27:17.291
URGED THE WHITE HOUSE TO

27:17.375 --> 27:18.333
LOOSEN SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

27:18.417 --> 27:19.875
IMPLEMENTED IN THE WAKE OF

27:19.959 --> 27:21.291
DEEPWATER HORIZON, WHICH THEY

27:21.375 --> 27:22.001
ARE NOW PLANNING TO DO, AND

27:22.084 --> 27:23.375
WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO SAVE OIL

27:23.458 --> 27:24.917
COMPANIES NEARLY A BILLION

27:25.001 --> 27:27.667
DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT DECADE,

27:27.750 --> 27:27.875
IT'S

27:27.959 --> 27:29.458
WHICH IS THE MOST SHOCKING

27:29.542 --> 27:30.667
TEN-DIGIT NUMBER I'VE HEARD

27:30.750 --> 27:35.500
SINCE 571-585-3730.

27:35.583 --> 27:41.000
SO IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR AT THIS

27:41.083 --> 27:42.583
POINT THAT TRUMP HAS, IN NO WAY,

27:42.667 --> 27:43.125
DRAINED THE SWAMP.

27:43.208 --> 27:44.500
WHAT HE HAS DONE IS DRAINED THE

27:44.583 --> 27:46.625
PHRASE OF ITS ORIGINAL MEANING.

27:46.709 --> 27:51.875
AND IN FAIRNESS TO HIM, HE WAS

27:51.959 --> 27:52.875
PRETTY TRANSPARENT FROM THE

27:52.959 --> 27:53.625
BEGINNING ABOUT HOW LITTLE HE

27:53.709 --> 27:54.417
MEANT IT.

27:54.500 --> 27:55.417
THIS IS HIM JUST ONE MONTH AFTER

27:55.500 --> 27:56.041
HIS ELECTION ESSENTIALLY TELLING

27:56.041 --> 27:56.209
HIS ELECTION ESSENTIALLY TELLING
EVERYONE TO THEIR FACES THAT THE

27:56.209 --> 27:56.875
EVERYONE TO THEIR FACES THAT THE

27:56.959 --> 27:58.166
PHRASE WAS MEANINGLESS.

27:58.250 --> 27:59.500
>> FUNNY HOW THAT TERM CAUGHT

27:59.583 --> 28:00.250
ON, ISN'T IT?

28:00.333 --> 28:02.126
I TELL -- I TELL EVERY --

28:02.209 --> 28:03.000
I HATED IT.

28:03.083 --> 28:04.000
SOMEBODY SAID, "DRAIN THE

28:04.000 --> 28:04.167
SOMEBODY SAID, "DRAIN THE
SWAMP."

28:04.167 --> 28:04.959
SWAMP."

28:05.042 --> 28:05.917
I SAID, "OH, THAT'S SO HOKEY.

28:06.001 --> 28:07.542
THAT IS SO TERRIBLE."

28:07.625 --> 28:09.000
I SAID, "OH, ALL RIGHT, I'LL TRY

28:09.000 --> 28:09.167
I SAID, "OH, ALL RIGHT, I'LL TRY
IT."

28:09.167 --> 28:10.375
IT."

28:10.458 --> 28:12.001
SO LIKE A MONTH AGO, I SAID,

28:12.084 --> 28:13.042
"DRAIN THE SWAMP."

28:13.126 --> 28:14.583
THE PLACE WENT CRAZY.

28:14.667 --> 28:15.500
I SAID, "WHOA.

28:15.583 --> 28:16.542
WHAT'S THIS?"

28:16.625 --> 28:17.208
THEN I SAID IT AGAIN.

28:17.291 --> 28:18.750
THEN I STARTED SAYING IT LIKE I

28:18.834 --> 28:19.959
MEANT IT, RIGHT?

28:20.042 --> 28:21.084
AND THEN I SAID IT, I STARTED

28:21.167 --> 28:23.208
LOVING IT.

28:23.291 --> 28:24.583
AND THE PLACE LOVED --

28:24.667 --> 28:25.333
"LET'S DRAIN THE SWAMP."

28:25.417 --> 28:26.709
I MEAN, IT'S TRUE.

28:26.792 --> 28:27.667
IT'S TRUE.

28:27.750 --> 28:28.709
IT'S TRUE.

28:28.792 --> 28:29.709
>> John: IT ISN'T.

28:29.792 --> 28:31.542
IT ISN'T.

28:31.625 --> 28:32.834
IT ISN'T.

28:32.917 --> 28:34.083
TRUMP NEVER MEANT "DRAIN THE

28:34.166 --> 28:35.208
SWAMP."

28:35.291 --> 28:36.166
AND YOU CAN TELL THAT BY WHAT'S

28:36.250 --> 28:37.125
HAPPENED SINCE.

28:37.208 --> 28:39.083
BECAUSE HE PROMISED TO CLEAN UP

28:39.166 --> 28:41.084
D.C., AND INSTEAD, THE GUY IN

28:41.167 --> 28:42.250
CHARGE OF THE CFPB IS HOLDING

28:42.333 --> 28:43.834
HANDS WITH LOAN SHARKS, THE EPA

28:43.917 --> 28:46.250
MIGHT AS WELL BE RUN BY A

28:46.333 --> 28:48.208
SENTIENT PIECE OF COAL, AND HIS

28:48.291 --> 28:49.042
HEAD OF OIL RIG SAFETY WANTS THE

28:49.126 --> 28:50.126
INDUSTRY TO BLOW UP HIS DIGITS

28:50.209 --> 28:51.250
LIKE AN UNDER-REGULATED OIL

28:51.333 --> 28:52.083
WELL.

28:52.166 --> 28:54.667
ALL IN ALL, IT SEEMS LIKE IF

28:54.750 --> 28:56.000
THERE IS ANYONE REMAINING STILL

28:56.000 --> 28:56.126
THERE IS ANYONE REMAINING STILL
HOPING THAT TRUMP MIGHT DRAIN

28:56.126 --> 28:57.333
HOPING THAT TRUMP MIGHT DRAIN

28:57.417 --> 28:59.250
THE SWAMP, YOU CAN NOW

28:59.333 --> 29:00.750
OFFICIALLY KISSY-FACE THAT IDEA

29:00.834 --> 29:02.583
GOODBYE.

29:02.667 --> 29:04.917

30:15.291 --> 30:16.667
FINALLY TONIGHT, LET'S TALK

30:16.750 --> 30:17.166
ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA, THE THING

30:17.250 --> 30:17.959
DAVE MATTHEWS USED TEN YEARS AGO

30:18.042 --> 30:18.375
TO TWEET THINGS LIKE --

30:18.458 --> 30:19.542
AND THESE ARE REAL --

30:19.625 --> 30:21.042
"DEAD FROG IN A FOUNTAIN,"

30:21.126 --> 30:22.125
"CUNNILINGUS IS MY FAVORITE,

AND WALKS IN THE AUTUMN,"

30:24.083 --> 30:24.792
"DO SPIDERS FART,"

30:24.875 --> 30:25.959
"SWALLOWED BY 'YOUR' FARTS," AND

30:26.042 --> 30:27.250
OF COURSE, "SHART PARTY," A

30:27.333 --> 30:28.333
TWEET THAT, FOR SOME REASON,

30:28.417 --> 30:29.583
ONLY HAS 48 RETWEETS, WHICH IS A

30:29.667 --> 30:31.500
TRAVESTY.

30:31.583 --> 30:32.583
IT SHOULD BE THE MOST RETWEETED

30:32.667 --> 30:33.750
POST IN HISTORY.

30:33.834 --> 30:35.625
IN FACT, STOP WATCHING THIS SHOW

30:35.709 --> 30:36.375
RIGHT NOW AND GO RETWEET IT

30:36.458 --> 30:37.792
IMMEDIATELY.

30:37.875 --> 30:39.042
"SHART PARTY" IS A MESSAGE THE

30:39.126 --> 30:41.375
ENTIRE WORLD NEEDS TO SEE.

30:46.167 --> 30:47.041
BUT A DECADE ON, THE INTERNET

30:47.125 --> 30:49.041
HAS CLEARLY CHANGED.

30:49.041 --> 30:49.209
HAS CLEARLY CHANGED.

30:57.042 --> 30:57.625
A BIG PROFIT.

30:57.709 --> 30:59.875
>> MEGASTARS LIKE SELENA GOMEZ

CAN MAKE AN ESTIMATED $550,000

31:14.126 --> 31:15.084
USES SOMETHING ON INSTAGRAM,

31:15.167 --> 31:16.001
IT IS REALLY HARD TO RESIST

31:16.084 --> 31:17.542
BUYING IT.

31:17.625 --> 31:18.625
WHEN I SAW THIS PICTURE OF HER,

31:18.709 --> 31:20.166
I BOUGHT THOSE YOGA PANTS, AND

31:20.250 --> 31:22.000

JUICY EVEN I WANT TO TAKE A

31:28.625 --> 31:34.041
BITE.

31:34.041 --> 31:34.209
BITE.
BUT THE CONCERN IS -- MY CONCERN

31:34.209 --> 31:35.208
BUT THE CONCERN IS -- MY CONCERN

31:35.291 --> 31:36.375
IS, WHAT IF SHE MADE ME BUY

31:36.458 --> 31:40.000
SOMETHING STUPID?

31:40.083 --> 31:41.250
AND LOOK, AS LONG AS PEOPLE ARE

31:41.333 --> 31:42.959
CLEAR THAT THEY'RE SHILLING FOR

31:43.042 --> 31:44.667
A PRODUCT, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY

31:44.750 --> 31:44.917
FINE.

31:45.001 --> 31:45.625
BUT COMPANIES SOMETIMES PULL OFF

31:45.709 --> 31:46.667
LARGE-SCALE MARKETING STUNTS

31:46.750 --> 31:47.542
WITHOUT MAKING IT CLEAR WHAT IS

31:47.625 --> 31:49.166
HAPPENING.

31:49.250 --> 31:50.625
>> IT'S AN EXPERTLY EXECUTED AD

31:50.709 --> 31:51.542
CAMPAIGN.

31:51.625 --> 31:53.084
50 OF THE HOTTEST FASHION

31:53.167 --> 31:54.959
BLOGGERS ALL IN THE SAME PAISLEY

31:55.042 --> 31:57.041
DRESS, ALL OVER INSTAGRAM, PAID

31:57.041 --> 31:57.209
DRESS, ALL OVER INSTAGRAM, PAID
AS MUCH AS $4,000 EACH TO POST

31:57.209 --> 31:59.125
AS MUCH AS $4,000 EACH TO POST

31:59.208 --> 32:01.875
THESE PICS ON THE SAME DAY.

32:01.959 --> 32:03.834
>> YEAH, AND THEY WERE ALL --

32:03.917 --> 32:06.583
THEY HAD US ALL POST AT THE SAME

32:06.667 --> 32:09.125
TIME, BETWEEN, LIKE, 12:00 P.M.

32:09.208 --> 32:10.625
AND 3:00 P.M, AND THEN POST IT

32:10.709 --> 32:12.291
TAGGING LORD & TAYLOR.

32:12.375 --> 32:13.125
>> THE CAMPAIGN, A HUGE SUCCESS,

32:13.208 --> 32:14.750
LORD & TAYLOR SELLING OUT OF

32:14.834 --> 32:16.042
THE DRESS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY,

32:16.126 --> 32:17.750
THE PHOTOBOMB REACHING MORE

32:17.834 --> 32:18.750
THAN 11 MILLION INSTAGRAM USERS

32:18.834 --> 32:22.041
IN JUST TWO DAYS.

32:22.125 --> 32:23.083
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, THAT'S NOT

32:23.166 --> 32:25.041
WHAT A "PHOTOBOMB" IS.

32:25.125 --> 32:26.500
A "PHOTOBOMB" WOULD BE IF,

32:26.583 --> 32:28.125
IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMEONE'S

32:28.208 --> 32:29.333
ENGAGEMENT PHOTO, THE DRESS

32:29.417 --> 32:30.542
INSERTED ITSELF, UNINVITED, INTO

32:30.625 --> 32:36.417
THE BACKGROUND.

32:36.500 --> 32:37.166
THAT'S A PHOTOBOMB.

32:37.250 --> 32:38.041
BUT HERE'S THE THING:

32:38.041 --> 32:38.209
BUT HERE'S THE THING:
THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT ALLOWED.

32:38.209 --> 32:38.709
THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT ALLOWED.

32:38.792 --> 32:39.542
IF YOU'RE BEING PAID, YOU'RE

32:39.625 --> 32:40.083
SUPPOSED TO TAG YOUR POST WITH A

32:40.166 --> 32:41.042
CLEAR DISCLOSURE, LIKE #Ad OR

32:41.126 --> 32:41.917
#Sponsored.

32:42.001 --> 32:42.792
SO LORD & TAYLOR GOT IN TROUBLE

32:42.875 --> 32:44.126
WITH THE FTC, WHICH SAID THE

32:44.209 --> 32:46.333
COMPANY HAD DECEIVED CONSUMERS

32:46.417 --> 32:48.166
NOT THE ONLY OFFENDER.

32:48.250 --> 32:49.500
ONE STUDY THAT LOOKED AT SOME OF

32:49.583 --> 32:50.709
THE BIGGEST SOCIAL MEDIA

32:50.792 --> 32:52.126
ACCOUNTS FOUND THAT OVER 90% OF

32:52.209 --> 32:53.125
SPONSORED POSTS WERE NOT

32:53.208 --> 32:55.084
PROPERLY LABELED OR DISCLOSED.

32:55.167 --> 32:56.291
THE KARDASHIANS HAVE OFTEN BEEN

32:56.375 --> 32:57.542
CRITICIZED FOR THIS.

32:57.625 --> 32:59.042
LAST YEAR, THE FTC SENT A

32:59.126 --> 33:00.625
LETTER TO POPEYES CHICKEN AFTER

33:00.709 --> 33:02.126
KOURTNEY KARDASHIAN POSTED

33:02.209 --> 33:04.667
THIS IMAGE OF HER AND KHLOE

33:04.750 --> 33:06.042
EATING POPEYE'S ON A PRIVATE

33:06.126 --> 33:07.709
JET, CAPTIONING IT WITH,

33:07.792 --> 33:08.667
"POPEYES ON THE PJ.

33:08.750 --> 33:11.250
#CheatDay."

33:11.333 --> 33:13.083
AND FIRST, YOU KNOW YOU'RE RICH

33:13.166 --> 33:15.583
IF THE COMMON ACRONYM "PJ" NO

33:15.667 --> 33:16.458
LONGER MEANS "PAJAMAS," IT MEANS

33:16.542 --> 33:19.083
"PRIVATE JET."

33:19.166 --> 33:21.126
"I NEED TO WORK FROM HOME TODAY,

33:21.209 --> 33:22.458
FYI -- YOU KNOW, FOR

33:22.542 --> 33:24.375
YACHT INSPECTION."

33:24.458 --> 33:26.417
"LOOK IN THE YARD, IT'S A

33:26.500 --> 33:27.250
UFO.

33:27.333 --> 33:29.959
THAT'S RIGHT: AN UNBELIEVABLY

33:30.042 --> 33:30.959
FANCY OSTRICH."

33:31.042 --> 33:31.709
PERHAPS THE MOST SHAMELESS

33:31.792 --> 33:33.042
SOCIAL-MEDIA MARKETER IS

33:33.126 --> 33:34.084
DJ KHALED.

33:34.167 --> 33:35.250
"TRUTH IN ADVERTISING" CATALOGED

33:35.333 --> 33:36.375
MORE THAN 200 INSTANCES IN A

33:36.458 --> 33:37.959
NINE-MONTH SPAN IN WHICH HE

33:38.042 --> 33:39.126
PROMOTED VARIOUS ALCOHOLIC

33:39.209 --> 33:40.126
DRINKS TO HIS MILLIONS OF

33:40.209 --> 33:40.792
FOLLOWERS, MANY OF WHOM ARE

33:40.875 --> 33:41.875
UNDER 21, WITHOUT DISCLOSING A

33:41.959 --> 33:43.333
CONNECTION TO THE COMPANIES.

33:43.417 --> 33:44.542
AND SOME OF THOSE VIDEOS WERE

33:44.625 --> 33:46.291
PRETTY REMARKABLE.

33:46.375 --> 33:47.875
>> IT'S TIME TO CELEBRATE.

33:47.959 --> 33:50.667
GRITS.

33:50.750 --> 33:52.000
CINNAMON TOAST CRUNCH WITH THE

33:52.083 --> 33:54.042
BELAIRE GOLD KEY.

33:54.126 --> 33:58.709
A LITTLE BERRIES, AND SOME

33:58.792 --> 34:01.959
CIROC RED BERRY.

34:02.042 --> 34:03.126
AND THEN GO BACK AND ADD A

34:03.209 --> 34:04.000
LITTLE MORE BERRIES AND A LITTLE

34:04.083 --> 34:12.126
MORE CHAMPAGNE.

34:12.209 --> 34:12.792
>> John: WOW.

34:12.875 --> 34:13.375
GRITS, TWO KINDS OF ALCOHOL,

34:13.458 --> 34:14.750
AND CINNAMON TOAST CRUNCH.

34:14.834 --> 34:15.291
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE CLUES FOR THE

34:15.375 --> 34:16.042
$100,000 PYRAMID CATEGORY:

34:16.126 --> 34:16.625
"THINGS THAT WILL BE PUMPED OUT

34:16.709 --> 34:17.417
OF KID ROCK'S STOMACH WHEN HE

34:17.500 --> 34:18.125
DIES."

34:18.208 --> 34:20.500
AND LOOK, LOOK, IS THIS THE MOST

34:20.583 --> 34:21.959
IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD?

34:22.042 --> 34:22.667
NO, BUT IT'S PROBABLY SAFEST

34:22.750 --> 34:24.125
TO ASSUME THAT UNTIL THIS IS ALL

34:24.208 --> 34:24.875
REGULATED, THAT ANYONE YOU SEE

34:24.959 --> 34:26.126
PROMOTING A PRODUCT IS PROBABLY

34:26.209 --> 34:27.041
BEING PAID FOR IT, AND

34:27.125 --> 34:29.125
POTENTIALLY A LOT OF MONEY.

34:29.208 --> 34:30.375
AND THAT MAY WELL AFFECT HOW

34:30.458 --> 34:31.166
MUCH YOU TRUST THAT PERSON GOING

34:31.250 --> 34:32.333
FORWARD.

34:32.417 --> 34:33.417
AND JUST TO BE CLEAR, I HAVE

34:33.500 --> 34:34.834
NEVER ACCEPTED COMPENSATION FOR

34:34.917 --> 34:37.875
ANYTHING ON THIS SHOW.

34:37.959 --> 34:39.166
BUT HAVING SEEN HOW MUCH MONEY

34:39.250 --> 34:40.875
IS INVOLVED HERE, WE'VE ACTUALLY

34:40.959 --> 34:42.625
BEEN DOING SOMETHING ALL YEAR

34:42.709 --> 34:46.250
LONG THAT, SURPRISINGLY, NO

34:46.333 --> 34:47.208
ONE HAS NOTICED, AND FRANKLY, IT

34:47.291 --> 34:53.500
IS PAYOFF TIME, BECAUSE I'VE

34:53.583 --> 34:55.000
BEEN QUIETLY ENGAGING IN

34:55.083 --> 34:56.291
ADVERTISING SO UNDISCLOSED, EVEN

34:56.375 --> 34:57.001
THE ADVERTISER DOESN'T KNOW

34:57.084 --> 34:57.291
ABOUT IT.

34:57.375 --> 34:58.333
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE

34:58.417 --> 34:59.000
CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY.

34:59.083 --> 35:00.126
WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE OR

35:00.209 --> 35:00.667
PERMISSION, I'VE BEEN PLUGGING

35:00.750 --> 35:01.125
THEM INFLUENCER-STYLE SINCE

35:01.208 --> 35:02.083
FEBRUARY.

35:02.166 --> 35:03.083
SOMETIMES IT'S BEEN SUBTLE.

35:03.166 --> 35:10.083
IN OUR SHOW ON GUARDIANSHIP, WE

35:10.166 --> 35:10.959
SNUCK A SCIENTOLOGY SYMBOL INTO

35:11.042 --> 35:11.709
THIS LOGO OF A FEDERAL AGENCY

35:11.792 --> 35:12.625
WE INVENTED.

35:12.709 --> 35:13.417
AND BACK IN MAY, WHEN I WAS

35:13.500 --> 35:15.042
PACKING THE SHOW UP, ONE OF THE

35:15.126 --> 35:16.041
ITEMS WAS THE BOOK DIANETICS.

35:16.041 --> 35:16.209
ITEMS WAS THE BOOK DIANETICS.
AND THEN THERE WAS THE TIME

35:16.209 --> 35:17.041
AND THEN THERE WAS THE TIME

35:17.125 --> 35:18.166
WE PUT L. RON HUBBARD'S NAME

35:18.250 --> 35:19.208
ON-SCREEN FOR NO GOOD REASON

35:19.291 --> 35:20.333
WHATSOEVER.

35:20.417 --> 35:21.959
IN FACT, FOR HALF THE YEAR,

35:22.042 --> 35:23.417
THE SCIENTOLOGY CELEBRITY CENTER

35:23.500 --> 35:24.041
HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BUILDINGS IN

35:24.125 --> 35:26.792
OUR BACKDROP.

35:26.875 --> 35:28.001
INCIDENTALLY, DRAGONSTONE, ONE

35:28.084 --> 35:29.291
OF THE CASTLES FROM

35:29.375 --> 35:31.041
"GAME OF THRONES," IS BACK THERE

35:31.125 --> 35:32.542
TOO, BUT THAT'S BEEN THERE SINCE

35:32.625 --> 35:34.125
THE START OF THE SHOW.

35:34.208 --> 35:35.875
WHICH BUILDING HAS CONTAINED

35:35.959 --> 35:39.084
MORE TORTURE AND CRUELTY?

35:39.167 --> 35:40.500
IT'S GENUINELY HARD TO SAY.

35:40.583 --> 35:42.126
AND HONESTLY, THERE IS STUFF I

35:42.209 --> 35:43.500
EXPECTED SOMEONE TO NOTICE.

35:43.583 --> 35:44.750
I'VE REPEATEDLY MENTIONED

35:44.834 --> 35:46.917
PROMINENT SCIENTOLOGISTS AND

35:47.001 --> 35:50.291
THEN VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED THEM.

35:50.375 --> 35:51.041
>> John: I DON'T BLAME HIM FOR

35:51.041 --> 35:51.209
>> John: I DON'T BLAME HIM FOR
ANYTHING THERE.

35:51.209 --> 35:52.001
ANYTHING THERE.

35:52.084 --> 35:52.542
HE'S GOT A GOOD HEAD ON HIS

35:52.625 --> 35:53.291
SHOULDERS.

35:53.375 --> 35:54.625
YOU STAY CLEAR, TOMMY.

35:54.709 --> 35:55.291
STAY CLEAR, MY BOY.

35:55.375 --> 35:56.042
IF SOMEBODY APPROACHES YOU,

35:56.126 --> 35:56.625
DON'T TELL THEM YOU'RE BEING

35:56.709 --> 35:57.542
PAID.

35:57.625 --> 35:58.500
WHICH ARE, AND THIS IS TRUE,

35:58.583 --> 35:59.500
WORD-FOR-WORD THE VOWS IN A

35:59.583 --> 36:00.792
TRADITIONAL SCIENTOLOGY WEDDING.

36:00.875 --> 36:01.917
NOW, THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL VOWS, AND

36:02.001 --> 36:03.500
YOU SHOULD GO.

36:03.583 --> 36:04.750
THAT IS THE TYPE OF CROWD

36:04.834 --> 36:05.709
REACTION THAT YOU'D EXPECT TO

36:05.792 --> 36:09.875
HEAR IF THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP WAS

36:09.959 --> 36:10.792
SUDDENLY WON BY BECK.

36:10.875 --> 36:12.667
WHICH -- WHICH IS TOTALLY

36:12.750 --> 36:13.959
PLAUSIBLE, BY THE WAY.

36:14.042 --> 36:15.208
THE GUY'S A SCIENTOLOGIST, AND

36:15.291 --> 36:16.000
THEY GIVE YOU SUPERPOWERS.

36:16.083 --> 36:16.792
IT'S NOT JUST A RELIGION, IT'S A

36:16.875 --> 36:17.542
SET OF PRINCIPLES TO HELP YOU

36:17.625 --> 36:19.417
UNDERSTAND AND IMPROVE YOUR LIFE

36:19.500 --> 36:21.001
AND MAYBE FLY.

36:21.084 --> 36:22.875
JUST -- JUST LOOK INTO IT.

36:22.959 --> 36:24.208
THAT'S ALL I AM COMPELLING YOU

36:24.291 --> 36:28.875
SINCERELY.

36:28.959 --> 36:29.625
>> John: THAT WAS A BIT WEIRD,

36:29.709 --> 36:33.709
RIGHT?

36:33.792 --> 36:35.041
AND I KNOW YOU MIGHT BE

36:35.041 --> 36:35.209
AND I KNOW YOU MIGHT BE
THINKING, "WELL, COME ON, JOHN.

36:35.209 --> 36:36.126
THINKING, "WELL, COME ON, JOHN.

36:36.209 --> 36:36.583
THAT WASN'T REALLY OBVIOUS

36:36.667 --> 36:37.291
ENOUGH.

36:37.375 --> 36:38.000
TO BE REALLY OBVIOUS, YOU'D HAVE

36:38.000 --> 36:38.167
TO BE REALLY OBVIOUS, YOU'D HAVE
TO STAND NEXT TO A VOLCANO LIKE

36:38.167 --> 36:39.042
TO STAND NEXT TO A VOLCANO LIKE

36:39.126 --> 36:39.417
THE ONE ON THE COVER OF

36:39.500 --> 36:40.750
DIANETICS AND MENTION

36:40.834 --> 36:41.834
LORD XENU."

36:41.917 --> 36:44.042
WELL, MAY I REMIND YOU BACK ON

36:44.126 --> 36:44.917
OUR SECOND SHOW HOW OUR ITALIAN

36:45.001 --> 36:47.001
ELECTION PIECE ENDED?

36:47.084 --> 36:48.041
>> John: THAT'S OUR SHOW!

36:48.125 --> 36:49.333
XENU NEXT WEEK!

36:49.417 --> 36:52.709
GOOD NIGHT!

36:52.792 --> 36:57.250
>> John: "XENU NEXT WEEK"?

36:57.333 --> 36:58.208
"XENU NEXT WEEK."

36:58.291 --> 36:59.250
WE THOUGHT THE GAME WAS UP THEN!

36:59.333 --> 37:00.000
WE HONESTLY THOUGHT WE'D GONE

37:00.083 --> 37:00.917
TOO HARD, TOO EARLY.

37:01.001 --> 37:04.083
AND THAT'S ONLY SOME OF THEM.

37:04.166 --> 37:04.875
WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS SHIT ALL

37:04.959 --> 37:05.417
YEAR.

37:05.500 --> 37:06.583
AND NOW IT'S TIME TO COLLECT.

37:06.667 --> 37:07.250
SO TO THE HEAD OF SCIENTOLOGY,

37:07.333 --> 37:08.125
DAVID MISCAVIGE --

37:08.208 --> 37:11.500
FIRST, LOVE TO SHELLEY.

37:11.583 --> 37:13.542
SECOND, YOU OWE ME.

37:13.625 --> 37:15.126
I'VE LOOKED INTO THIS, AND

37:15.209 --> 37:16.041
APPARENTLY, ROCK "THE DWAYNE"

37:16.041 --> 37:16.167
APPARENTLY, ROCK "THE DWAYNE"
JOHNSON MAKES AROUND

37:16.167 --> 37:16.625
JOHNSON MAKES AROUND

37:16.709 --> 37:18.041
$650,000 FOR A SPONSORED POST.

37:18.125 --> 37:19.166
AND I'M WORTH ONE "ROCK" POST AT

37:19.250 --> 37:21.625
LEAST.

37:21.709 --> 37:24.000
SO I'LL TAKE $650,000, PLEASE.

37:24.000 --> 37:24.167
SO I'LL TAKE $650,000, PLEASE.
I KNOW YOU HAVE THE MONEY.

37:24.167 --> 37:25.000
I KNOW YOU HAVE THE MONEY.

37:25.000 --> 37:25.167
I KNOW YOU HAVE THE MONEY.
JOHN TRAVOLTA PROBABLY GAVE YOU

37:25.167 --> 37:26.667
JOHN TRAVOLTA PROBABLY GAVE YOU

37:26.750 --> 37:28.083
A LOT OF HIS.

37:28.166 --> 37:29.083
AND IF YOU, SCIENTOLOGY, ARE

37:29.166 --> 37:30.083
GOING TO TELL ME, "THAT'S

37:30.166 --> 37:31.291
RIDICULOUS.

37:31.375 --> 37:32.208
YOU CAN'T PRETEND YOU CONFERRED

37:32.291 --> 37:33.792
SOME UNPROVABLE BENEFIT ON US
