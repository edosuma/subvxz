AND FIND A SEA
OF OVERRATED DOCTORS

UH, OVERRATED DOCTOR WITH
QUESTIONABLE ETHICS AT 12:00.

01:26.542 --> 01:29.041
YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD TODAY,

ARE YOU BRINGING COFFEE?

ACTUALLY, NO. I'M HERE
TO SEE THE OTHER DR. BENNETT.
NAOMI?

01:36.083 --> 01:39.041
WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH NAOMI?
WELL,THAT'S
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

01:39.083 --> 01:42.041
YOU'LL BE SURE TO TELL HER
I STOPPED BY?
NO.

01:42.083 --> 01:45.250
YET SOMETHING TELLS ME
YOU'LL REMEMBER.

01:46.667 --> 01:48.625
THIS REALLY IS
A NICE OFFICE.

01:48.667 --> 01:50.041
THE WOODEN BEAMS...

01:56.083 --> 01:59.250
I LIKE THE BEAMS.

01:59.291 --> 02:01.041
I DON'T LIKE HIM.

02:01.083 --> 02:03.500
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE WANTS
WITH NAOMI?

02:13.542 --> 02:16.750
"PASSION FRUIT
PAPAYA BLACK TEA"?

02:16.792 --> 02:20.083
I'M THIRSTY.
BOY, YOU'RE ALSO
RELAXED AND SMILEY.

02:20.125 --> 02:21.542

02:21.583 --> 02:24.041
I MEAN, USUALLY THEY'RE...
LIKE THIS...
(laughs)

02:24.083 --> 02:27.125
BUT NOW THEY'RE LIKE THAT.
YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.

02:27.166 --> 02:30.041
(snaps fingers)
YOU HAD SEX.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.333
YOU HAD SEX.
I DON'T REALLY
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

02:32.375 --> 02:34.375
I-I JUST...
I WANT TO SAVOR IT.

02:34.417 --> 02:36.041
OKAY. WHO'S THE LUCKY GUY?

02:36.083 --> 02:37.083
HEY.

02:37.125 --> 02:39.542
I JUST WANT TO SAVOR IT.

02:43.083 --> 02:46.375
VIOLET HAD SEX.

02:46.417 --> 02:48.417
OH.

02:50.542 --> 02:53.709
SIX WEEKS ON THE ROAD?

02:53.750 --> 02:56.709
THAT'S A LOT OF DRIVING, MAN.
YOU MUST MISS HOME.

02:56.750 --> 02:59.709
A LITTLE, BUT I DON'T MIND
BEING IN THE CAR.

02:59.750 --> 03:01.917
I GET TO READ A LOT.

03:01.959 --> 03:04.041
I READ A LOT AS A KID, TOO,

03:04.083 --> 03:06.041
AND MY FRIENDS
THOUGHT I WAS WEIRD,

03:06.083 --> 03:09.041
AND I DIDN'T CARE,
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT WAS COOL.
WE'RE ON THE ROAD.

03:09.083 --> 03:12.041
I DON'T REALLY HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT FRIENDS.

03:12.083 --> 03:14.041
HMM. HAVE YOU BEEN
TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF,

03:14.083 --> 03:16.041
CHECKING
YOUR BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL?

03:16.083 --> 03:18.041
BEFORE I EAT,
BUT SOMETIMES I FEEL DIZZY.

03:18.083 --> 03:21.750
OKAY, LET'S SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.
(click)

03:21.792 --> 03:23.208
(lancing device clatters)

03:23.250 --> 03:25.166
OKAY.

03:28.083 --> 03:30.041
YOU'RE READING
"THREE MUSKETEERS," HUH?

03:30.083 --> 03:32.041
YOU LIKE THE EPICS?
I LIKE THAT WORLD,

03:32.083 --> 03:35.417
AND I LIKE THAT NO ONE
CAN TEAR THEM APART.

03:35.458 --> 03:39.458
HMM. IT'S 210,
WHICH IS KINDA HIGH, PORTER.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.875
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THAT PUMP.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.667
GIVING YOU ANY TROUBLE?

03:43.709 --> 03:46.041
IT GETS CLOGGED,
BUT MY DAD FIXES IT.

03:46.083 --> 03:49.375
WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOM?
SHE DIED
WHEN I WAS A BABY.

03:49.417 --> 03:51.792
IT'S JUST ME AND DAD.

03:51.834 --> 03:55.041
LET'S SEE.

03:55.083 --> 03:58.583
OUCH.
SORRY. THINK YOU HAVE
A LITTLE INFECTION

03:58.625 --> 04:00.250
NEAR THE INSERTION POINT.

04:00.291 --> 04:03.166
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE YOU'VE BEEN
KEEPING THAT REALLY CLEAN.

04:03.208 --> 04:06.000
I'VE BEEN TRYING, BUT...
BUT WHAT?

04:07.625 --> 04:10.250
HEY, IT'S OKAY.
YOU CAN TELL ME.

04:10.291 --> 04:13.417
WE'VE BEEN SLEEPING
IN THE CAR.

04:14.875 --> 04:17.834
TELL ME WHAT
I'M CHECKING FOR HERE.

04:17.875 --> 04:21.041
I'M NOT IN MED SCHOOL YET.
IT NEVER HURTS
TO GET AHEAD.

04:21.083 --> 04:24.458
I'M CHECKING YOUR OVARIES
FOR MASSES.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.458
EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.625
(sighs) GOOD.
(clears throat)

04:29.667 --> 04:31.041
I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS.

04:31.083 --> 04:33.041
DO YOU HAVE REASON TO BE?

04:33.083 --> 04:35.250
I'VE HAD
MORE SEXUAL PARTNERS LATELY.

04:35.291 --> 04:36.834
OKAY.

04:36.875 --> 04:38.625
MORE THAN FIVE?

04:38.667 --> 04:39.458
MM-HMM.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.917
MORE THAN TEN?

04:41.959 --> 04:43.291
11...

04:43.333 --> 04:44.834
THIS MONTH.

04:44.875 --> 04:47.041
THAT IS A LOT.

04:47.083 --> 04:49.542
I WASN'T GOING TO TELL YOU.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:49.583 --> 04:51.583
PROMISE YOU WON'T JUDGE ME?

04:54.166 --> 04:56.125
I'M SAVING UP
TO GO TO MED SCHOOL.

04:56.166 --> 04:57.500
MM-HMM.

04:57.542 --> 05:00.542
I'VE BEEN WORKING PART-TIME
AS A CALL GIRL.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.458
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

05:10.500 --> 05:12.542
IT'S NOT AS BAD
AS IT SOUNDS.
IT'S INSANE.

05:12.583 --> 05:15.709
I HAVE TO PAY FOR SCHOOL
SOMEHOW.
TAKE OUT A LOAN.

05:15.750 --> 05:18.500
AND BE IN DEBT TILL I'M 50?
(sighs) CARLEY.

05:18.542 --> 05:20.375
THE MONEY'S AMAZING,

05:20.417 --> 05:22.375
AND THE GUYS
ARE REALLY NICE.

05:22.417 --> 05:24.792
LAST WEEKEND, ONE OF
THE GIRLS MET THIS GUY

05:24.834 --> 05:28.041
WHO FLEW A COUPLE OF US
OUT TO DUBAYY FOR A PARTY,

05:28.083 --> 05:30.041
AND IF I TOLD YOU
HOW MUCH WE MADE--

05:30.083 --> 05:32.709
I WOULD STILL BE CONCERNED
ABOUT YOU.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.917
I'M FINE.

05:34.959 --> 05:37.917
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING,
WHICH IS KIND OF WHY I CAME.

05:37.959 --> 05:40.917
SOME OF THE GIRLS
THINK THEY MIGHT HAVE

05:40.959 --> 05:43.500
PICKED UP SOMETHING
FROM THE PARTY.
AN S.T.D.?

05:43.542 --> 05:46.500
AND THEY WERE HOPING
YOU COULD SEE THEM.
(exhales deeply)

05:46.542 --> 05:48.500
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO USE
STUDENT HEALTH.

05:48.542 --> 05:51.750
THEY DIDN'T WANT WORD
TO GET OUT.
I DON'T LIKE THIS, CARLEY.

05:51.792 --> 05:54.667
PLEASE.

05:57.417 --> 05:59.750
I'M...

05:59.792 --> 06:01.208
GONNA GIVE YOU MY CARD.

06:01.250 --> 06:03.959
I'M GONNA WRITE DOWN
MY PERSONAL CELL.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.542
THANK YOU.

06:05.583 --> 06:08.750
THAT MEANS A LOT.

06:08.792 --> 06:11.000
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

06:16.667 --> 06:19.417
SO PORTER'S BLOOD SUGAR
IS UNSTABLE,

06:19.458 --> 06:21.417
UM, AND HE HAS AN INFECTION

06:21.458 --> 06:23.959
FROM NOT CLEANING
HIS CANNULA.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
I'M GONNA START HIM
ON ANTIBIOTICS,

06:26.041 --> 06:28.000
BUT HE DOES NEED
A NEW INSULIN PUMP.

06:28.041 --> 06:30.000
OH, HOW LONG
WILL THAT TAKE?

06:30.041 --> 06:33.000
I NEED TO ORDER A NEW ONE,
SO THREE DAYS, MAYBE FOUR.

06:33.041 --> 06:36.208
I CAN'T WAIT. I HAVE TO BE IN
OREGON BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

06:36.250 --> 06:39.000
I HAVE A JOB INTERVIEW.
WITHOUT A WORKING PUMP,

06:39.041 --> 06:41.583
HIS SUGAR LEVEL IS
GONNA CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE.
WELL, I'LL BE CAREFUL.

06:41.625 --> 06:44.458
NO, I'M SURE YOU WILL,
BUT BEING ON THE ROAD PRESENTS

06:44.500 --> 06:47.458
A UNIQUE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES
FOR A DIABETIC 12 YEAR OLD.

06:47.500 --> 06:51.000
PORTER TOLD ME ABOUT
YOUR SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS.

06:51.041 --> 06:56.041
YOU THINK I-I WANT MY KID
SLEEPING IN A CAR?

06:56.083 --> 06:59.041
YOU KNOW, IT WAS HARD ENOUGH
LOSING MY JOB AND OUR HOUSE,

06:59.083 --> 07:01.041
AND NOW I GOTTA LIVE
WITH THE SHAME

07:01.083 --> 07:03.250
OF NOT PROVIDING FOR MY SON.

07:03.291 --> 07:06.834
I KNOW IT MUST BE DIFFICULT.
I NEED THIS JOB,
DR. FREEDMAN.

07:06.875 --> 07:09.041
IF YOU DON'T STOP,
YOUR SON COULD DIE.

07:09.083 --> 07:11.041
IT'S NOT A CHOICE, FRANK.

07:11.083 --> 07:13.458
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

07:18.125 --> 07:21.041
I'VE KNOWN CARLEY
FOR ALMOST A YEAR.

07:21.083 --> 07:23.500
I MEAN, SHE'S A NICE GIRL
WORKING HER ASS OFF

07:23.542 --> 07:25.041
TO GET INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL.

07:25.083 --> 07:27.041
I-I JUST--I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE'S DOING THIS.

07:27.083 --> 07:29.041
WELL, SHE GREW UP
WITH NOTHING.

07:29.083 --> 07:31.041
NOW SHE MAKES MORE MONEY
IN A MONTH

07:31.083 --> 07:33.041
THAN HER PARENTS DO
IN A YEAR.
THE WORST PART

07:33.083 --> 07:36.041
IS THAT SHE DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE BOTHERED BY IT.
WELL, SHE'S REPRESSING EMOTION.

07:36.083 --> 07:39.041
IT'S A DEFENSE MECHANISM TO HELP
HER COPE WITH WHAT SHE'S DOING.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.041
MOST PROSTITUTES
HAVE LOW SELF-ESTEEM.

07:41.083 --> 07:44.125
MANY OF 'EM WERE VICTIMS
OF SEXUAL ABUSE.
I'VE MET A FEW CALL GIRLS
IN MY DAY.

07:44.166 --> 07:47.125
AND WE WOULD DISCUSS
WHY THEY GOT INTO THE TRADE,

07:47.166 --> 07:49.667
AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE
TOUCHED INAPPROPRIATELY

07:49.709 --> 07:52.667
OR FORCED TO HAVE SEX.
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT YOU
TO BELIEVE IT

07:52.709 --> 07:54.750
BECAUSE IT KILLS THE FANTASY.
DON'T KID YOURSELF.

07:54.792 --> 07:56.917
THESE GIRLS ARE VICTIMS.
TRY TELLING THAT TO CARLEY.

07:56.959 --> 08:00.750
HEY, PETE.
YOU EVER PAY FOR SEX?

08:00.792 --> 08:02.375
DON'T HAVE TO.

08:04.792 --> 08:06.500
WHAT'S UP WITH HIM?

08:06.542 --> 08:09.417
I DON'T KNOW.
I GOTTA GET BACK TO WORK.

08:16.750 --> 08:19.500
SO... YOU GONNA
TELL US WHAT HE WANTED?
WHO?

08:19.542 --> 08:23.583
WYATT LOCKHART.
OH, I HAVEN'T BEEN DOWN
TO TALK TO HIM YET.

08:23.625 --> 08:26.125
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

08:26.166 --> 08:29.291
I WILL GO.

08:29.333 --> 08:32.750
CLAUDIA JENKINS,
35-YEAR-OLD WOMAN,

08:32.792 --> 08:35.291
STAGE II ADENOCARCINOMA
OF THE LUNGS.

08:35.333 --> 08:37.375
NOW USUALLY A PATIENT
WITH THAT TYPE OF CANCER

08:37.417 --> 08:39.542
DIES WITHIN A YEAR.

08:39.583 --> 08:42.750
THIS X-RAY WAS TAKEN
WHEN I FIRST MET HER.

08:42.792 --> 08:45.125
THIS WAS TAKEN
JUST LAST WEEK.

08:45.166 --> 08:48.375
OH, MY GOD. THAT'S AMAZING.
THAT'S FULL REMISSION,

08:48.417 --> 08:51.542
THANKS TO
MY AGGRESSIVE COMBINATION

08:51.583 --> 08:54.208
OF CHEMO
AND RADIATION PROTOCOLS.
SO YOU ASKED ME DOWN HERE

08:54.250 --> 08:56.208
JUST TO SHOW OFF
ONE OF YOUR MIRACLES?

08:56.250 --> 08:58.750
NO. NO, NO. I BROUGHT YOU
DOWN HERE BECAUSE...

08:58.792 --> 09:03.041
MY MIRACLE
WANTS TO GET PREGNANT.

09:03.083 --> 09:07.000
(Muzak playing on speakerphone)

09:07.041 --> 09:09.000
WHAT'S WITH
THE ELEVATOR MUSIC?

09:09.041 --> 09:11.041
I'M ON HOLD.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'D DO

09:11.083 --> 09:13.458
IF I EVER MET THE GUY
THAT PICKS THESE SONGS?

09:13.500 --> 09:16.458
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
THE DIABETIC KID
I SAW THIS MORNING?

09:16.500 --> 09:19.583
HIS INSULIN PUMP IS
REGISTERED TO SOMEONE ELSE.
OKAY, YOU CAN'T REUSE PUMPS.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.583
I KNOW, SO I USED
THE SERIAL NUMBER TO TRACK

09:21.625 --> 09:24.792
THE DOCTOR THAT INSTALLED IT.
THAT'S WHO I'M HOLDING FOR.

09:24.834 --> 09:26.792
BUT THIS KID'S DAD--
SOMETHING WAS OFF,

09:26.834 --> 09:29.041
AND THEY'RE
LIVING OUT OF THEIR CAR.

09:29.083 --> 09:32.041
YOU THINK THEY COULD'VE
STOLEN AN INSULIN PUMP?

09:32.083 --> 09:33.792
WELL, TIMES ARE TOUGH.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.792
(beep)
(man) Hello?

09:35.834 --> 09:39.834
YES, HI. I GAVE YOUR SECRETARY
THE SERIAL NUMBER OF...

09:39.875 --> 09:41.834
RIGHT.

09:41.875 --> 09:44.458
OH, THAT'S AWFUL.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.250
NO, I...

09:47.291 --> 09:49.834
I'M GONNA CALL YOU BACK.

09:49.875 --> 09:51.834
WHAT'D HE SAY?

09:51.875 --> 09:55.041
THE KID WHO THE PUMP
IS REGISTERED TO...

09:55.083 --> 09:56.625
HE WAS KIDNAPPED.

10:03.750 --> 10:06.208
IT'S GOTTA BE
THE SAME KID.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.458
SAME AGE, SAME HEIGHT,
SAME BLOOD TYPE.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.417
WELL, WE GOTTA CALL
THE POLICE THEN,

10:10.458 --> 10:12.417
LET THEM KNOW WE'RE DEALING
WITH A KIDNAPPING.

10:12.458 --> 10:15.041
I WANT TO TALK TO HIM FIRST.

10:15.083 --> 10:17.041
COOP, THIS KID COULD BE
IN SERIOUS DANGER.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.875
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF FRANK'S THE REAL FATHER.

10:18.917 --> 10:21.125
HE COULD BE ANYONE.
I SAW THEM TOGETHER.
PORTER TRUSTED THIS GUY.

10:21.166 --> 10:23.125
AND IF FRANK
WAS SOME STRANGER,

10:23.166 --> 10:25.458
HE WOULDN'T HAVE LET ME
EXAMINE PORTER BY MYSELF,

10:25.500 --> 10:27.458
AND THE KID COULD HAVE TOLD ME
TO CALL THE COPS.

10:27.500 --> 10:30.041
WHAT IF YOU'RE WRONG? FRANK
GETS SPOOKED, HE TAKES OFF.

10:30.083 --> 10:33.458
THIS COULD BE YOUR ONLY CHANCE
TO SAVE THIS KID.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.959
WHY ARE YOU GIVING ME
A PATIENT

10:36.000 --> 10:37.959
WHEN THE REST OF YOUR PRACTICE
HAS DONE EVERYTHING

10:38.000 --> 10:40.458
THEY CAN POSSIBLY DO
TO UNDERMINE US UPSTAIRS?

10:40.500 --> 10:43.667
HE'S NOT. PERHAPS DR. LOCKHART
WASN'T CLEAR.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.917
CLAUDIA JENKINS
IS OUR PATIENT.

10:45.959 --> 10:48.041
SHE'S PART OF
AN ONGOING CLINICAL STUDY.

10:48.083 --> 10:50.500
SHE'S CONTINUING CANCER
TREATMENTS. YOU'D BE CONSULTING.

10:50.542 --> 10:53.166
(laughs) YOU WANT ME
TO WORK FOR YOU?

10:53.208 --> 10:55.917
I HAVE WORK UPSTAIRS.
(chuckles) TELL YOU WHAT,

10:55.959 --> 10:57.917
IF YOUR PATIENT
WANTS FERTILITY TREATMENTS,

10:57.959 --> 11:00.917
HAVE HER GIVE ME A CALL.
NO ONE WHO'S SURVIVED
THIS TYPE OF CANCER

11:00.959 --> 11:03.709
HAS EVER BEEN ABLE
TO CONCEIVE.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.583
THOUGHT YOU LIKED
A CHALLENGE.
WITH YOUR HELP,
I CAN GET HER PREGNANT.

11:06.625 --> 11:09.125
WE CAN GET HER PREGNANT.

11:11.542 --> 11:14.792
(indistinct conversations)

11:17.834 --> 11:20.041
(clears throat)

11:20.083 --> 11:21.750
IS THIS YOU?

11:24.041 --> 11:25.625
YES.

11:25.667 --> 11:27.166
WOW. I WRITE, TOO.

11:27.208 --> 11:30.125
WELL, SHORT STORIES, MOSTLY,
BUT, UM,

11:30.166 --> 11:34.834
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR
HOW YOU GOT STARTED,

11:34.875 --> 11:37.583
IF YOU EVER HAD
SOME TIME.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.542
YOU'LL CALL ME?

11:41.583 --> 11:43.041
(laughs)

11:43.083 --> 11:44.333
(laughs)

11:44.375 --> 11:46.208
OOH.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.333
UM, THE, UM, KIDNAPPED KID
IS COMING BACK IN.

11:50.375 --> 11:52.333
OH, OKAY.

11:52.375 --> 11:55.750
IS IT COLLEGE DAY?
I LOVED COLLEGE.

11:55.792 --> 11:58.792
WHO ARE THEY HERE TO SEE?
THEY'RE HERE TO SEE ADDISON.

11:58.834 --> 12:01.041
REFERRALS FROM
HER COED CALL GIRL.

12:01.083 --> 12:03.583
THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE
CALL GIRLS TO ME.

12:03.625 --> 12:07.041
A ROOM FULL OF CALL GIRLS--
I'VE HAD DREAMS LIKE THIS.

12:07.083 --> 12:09.583
ARE YOU SUCKING IN
YOUR GUT?
NO, NO.

12:09.625 --> 12:11.375
(elevator bell dings)

12:11.417 --> 12:13.583
HEY, GUYS.
HEY.

12:13.625 --> 12:16.250
WHAT'S WITH THE CALL GIRLS?

12:16.291 --> 12:19.083
I DO THIS FOR A LIVING.

12:21.917 --> 12:23.417
HEY.
(Violet) HEY.

12:23.458 --> 12:25.417
(Addison) HEY.
HI.

12:25.458 --> 12:28.041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I HAD... REHAB
DOWN THE STREET.

12:28.083 --> 12:31.041
I THOUGHT I'D COME BY,
SEE IF YOU HAD TIME FOR COFFEE,

12:31.083 --> 12:33.458
BUT, UH, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE BOOKED.

12:33.500 --> 12:36.250
SEEING HOOKERS
A SUBSPECIALTY NOW?
WAIT. YOU'RE SEEING
MORE PROSTITUTES?

12:36.291 --> 12:38.875
I'M SEEING WOMEN.
OF THE NIGHT.

12:38.917 --> 12:42.875
WAIT, YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THIS?
YEAH, I DO. LOOK, I AM
ALL FOR FREE CHOICE,

12:42.917 --> 12:45.667
BUT THESE GIRLS ARE DAMAGED.
THEY CAN'T MAKE GOOD CHOICES.

12:45.709 --> 12:48.417
SO, YEAH, I THINK THAT IF YOU
ONLY TREAT THEM PHYSICALLY,

12:48.458 --> 12:50.417
THEN YOU'RE JUST
PERPETUATING THEIR PROBLEM.

12:50.458 --> 12:53.208
IS THIS REALLY WHAT
OUR PRACTICE IS COMING TO?
WELL, WHAT SHOULD IT BE?

12:53.250 --> 12:55.834
JUST ANOTHER HIGH-END
WESTSIDE CLINIC

12:55.875 --> 12:58.208
CATERING TO
AN OVERLY EXCLUSIVE CLIENTELE?

12:58.250 --> 13:00.917
I MEAN, IS THAT WHAT WE ARE?

13:00.959 --> 13:04.041
THIS ISN'T EXACTLY
HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.041
AND YOU THINK
THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE?

13:06.083 --> 13:08.041
YOU WANT TO HEAR
THE STATISTICS AND LINKS

13:08.083 --> 13:11.041
BETWEEN PROSTITUTION AND DRUGS,
PROSTITUTION AND VIOLENT CRIME?

13:11.083 --> 13:12.750
I'M NOT CONDONING
THEIR BEHAVIOR,

13:12.792 --> 13:15.041
BUT THEY'RE NOT STREETWALKERS.

13:15.083 --> 13:17.333
AND YOU THINK JUST BECAUSE
THEY'RE IN SCHOOL EVERY DAY

13:17.375 --> 13:20.041
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GONNA LEAD
DOWN THE SAME PATH?

13:20.083 --> 13:23.041
THEY MAY THINK IT'S TEMPORARY,
BUT YOU WANT TO LAY ODDS

13:23.083 --> 13:26.500
ON HOW MANY ARE STILL DOING IT
FIVE YEARS FROM NOW?

13:26.542 --> 13:31.917
I...
PROBABLY HAVE PATIENTS.

13:33.291 --> 13:35.250
I HAVE PATIENTS, TOO.

13:35.291 --> 13:38.542
WELL, I BETTER LET YOU
GET BACK TO THEM.

13:43.625 --> 13:45.625
HOLD THE DOOR.

13:47.542 --> 13:49.542
OH. SORRY. I--

13:49.583 --> 13:51.959
NO, I...

13:57.083 --> 14:00.625
RIGHT. GOOD IDEA.
I WAS JUST--
YEAH.

14:02.333 --> 14:04.417
I SHOULD...

14:08.166 --> 14:10.166
(elevator bell dings)

14:10.208 --> 14:12.000
HELLO, DOCTOR.

14:19.625 --> 14:22.458
WELL, I, UH...

14:24.792 --> 14:27.041
YOU LOOK SURPRISED
TO SEE ME.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.041
I JUST DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
TILL TONIGHT.

14:29.083 --> 14:31.041
OH, I HAVE SOME CHARTS
TO PICK UP,

14:31.083 --> 14:33.041
AND I MISSED YOU.

14:33.083 --> 14:34.583
I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.667
(chuckles)

14:40.375 --> 14:42.333
I GOT YOUR CALL.
YOU SAID IT'S URGENT.

14:42.375 --> 14:44.375
YEAH, THERE'S
A COUPLE MORE TESTS

14:44.417 --> 14:46.375
I WANT TO RUN ON PORTER.

14:46.417 --> 14:48.375
UM, IT'LL JUST TAKE
A MINUTE, THOUGH.

14:48.417 --> 14:50.375
YOU CAN---
YOU CAN STAY HERE.

14:50.417 --> 14:51.834
OH, HEY, ONE SECOND, PORTER.

14:51.875 --> 14:54.375
DELL, CAN YOU KEEP AN EYE
ON THE FATHER OUT THERE,

14:54.417 --> 14:56.375
MAKE SURE
HE DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE?
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.041
THANKS.

14:58.083 --> 15:00.000
HERE. HAVE A SEAT, BUDDY.

15:01.667 --> 15:05.166
WHAT KIND OF TESTS?
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

15:05.208 --> 15:08.166
NO, NO. I JUST--
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU, PORTER.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.375
I-I...
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

15:10.417 --> 15:13.000
UM, YOUR INSULIN PUMP

15:13.041 --> 15:16.458
IS REGISTERED TO A KID
NAMED EVAN DAWSON.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.875
SO?

15:18.917 --> 15:23.041
SO I THINK THAT'S YOU.
IS IT YOU? YOU OKAY?

15:23.083 --> 15:24.875
IS HE HURTING YOU?

15:24.917 --> 15:27.542
DID HE FORCE YOU
TO LEAVE YOUR MOTHER?

15:31.667 --> 15:36.417
I WANT TO HELP YOU, EVAN.
I'M GONNA HELP YOU.

15:36.458 --> 15:39.458
BUT I NEED YOU
TO LEVEL WITH ME.

15:41.333 --> 15:45.041
HE WAS NICE AT FIRST,

15:45.083 --> 15:48.959
TOLD ME WE'D DO ALL KINDS
OF FUN THINGS TOGETHER.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.500
BUT THEN HE STARTED
HITTING ME.

15:51.542 --> 15:54.041
I'M NOT GONNA LET THAT
HAPPEN AGAIN. I PROMISE YOU.

15:54.083 --> 15:57.041
WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON
THAT MAN OUT THERE RIGHT NOW.

15:57.083 --> 15:58.500
NO, NOT HIM.

15:58.542 --> 16:01.041
NOT MY FATHER.

16:01.083 --> 16:03.542
MY MOM'S BOYFRIEND TED.

16:03.583 --> 16:07.959
HE MOVED IN SIX MONTHS AFTER
SHE KICKED MY DAD OUT.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.041
WHEN MY MOM WASN'T AROUND,
TED WOULD GET ANGRY.

16:12.083 --> 16:14.750
DID YOU TELL YOUR MOM?

16:14.792 --> 16:16.750
SHE WOULD ASK HIM ABOUT IT,

16:16.792 --> 16:21.125
BUT... HE WOULD SAY
IT WASN'T TRUE.

16:21.166 --> 16:23.959
BUT MY DAD BELIEVED ME.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.083
HE WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO DID.

16:27.125 --> 16:30.041
(breathing heavily)

16:30.083 --> 16:31.375
EVAN.

16:31.417 --> 16:33.041
I NEED HELP IN HERE!

16:33.083 --> 16:35.125
(murmurs)

16:35.166 --> 16:37.542
WHAT?
I NEED AN AMP OF D50.

16:37.583 --> 16:39.291
OKAY, I'M ON IT.

16:39.333 --> 16:42.500
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?
HIS BLOOD SUGAR'S TANKING.
HE'S HAVING A SEIZURE.

16:42.542 --> 16:44.542
ALL RIGHT.
HOLD HIM STEADY.

16:44.583 --> 16:46.750
HOLD HIM STEADY.

16:50.750 --> 16:53.709
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HIM?
TRYING TO SAVE HIS LIFE.

16:53.750 --> 16:56.041
PLEASE DON'T LET HIM DIE.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.125
HE'S ALL I HAVE.

17:03.375 --> 17:05.208
IS HE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

17:05.250 --> 17:07.000
I DON'T KNOW.

17:07.041 --> 17:09.000
PLEASE. LOOK, HE WAS FINE
FIVE HOURS AGO.

17:09.041 --> 17:11.000
I CHECKED HIS PUMP.
I CHECKED IT. IT--

17:11.041 --> 17:14.000
RIGHT NOW, MY--MY PRIORITY
IS EVAN. YOU UNDERSTAND?

17:14.041 --> 17:16.000
DO NOT MOVE
UNTIL I GET BACK.

17:16.041 --> 17:18.417
WE'RE GONNA GO ON MY COUNT.

17:18.458 --> 17:22.000
ONE, TWO, THREE.

17:25.041 --> 17:27.000
(knock on door)
(Sam) HEY.

17:27.041 --> 17:29.375
HEY,
IS THAT KID OKAY?
I HOPE SO.

17:29.417 --> 17:31.834
HE'S AT THE, UH, THE HOSPITAL
WITH COOPER RIGHT NOW.

17:31.875 --> 17:34.417
GOOD. YOU ALL DONE
WITH YOUR PROSTITUTES?

17:34.458 --> 17:37.166
FIRST, KEVIN'S MORALISTIC JOE,
NOW YOU?
THOSE WOMEN SELL THEMSELVES.

17:37.208 --> 17:40.166
THEY MAKE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE
ALL WOMEN ARE FOR SALE.

17:40.208 --> 17:42.375
THEY NEED A DOCTOR.
I AM A DOCTOR.

17:42.417 --> 17:44.250
WHAT DID WYATT WANT?

17:44.291 --> 17:46.250
OH, UM, HE WANTED ME
TO CONSULT

17:46.291 --> 17:50.041
ON ONE OF HIS CANCER PATIENTS
WHO WANTS TO GET PREGNANT.
CONSULT?

17:50.083 --> 17:53.166
FOR HIM?
YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY CONSIDERING
WORKING WITH THIS GUY,

17:53.208 --> 17:55.875
WORKING
FOR CHARLOTTE'S PRACTICE?
I SAID I'D THINK ABOUT IT.

17:55.917 --> 17:58.375
THEY'RE TRYING TO DRIVE US
OUT OF BUSINESS, NAOMI.

17:58.417 --> 18:01.375
LOOK, ALL I KNOW IS THAT THIS
WOMAN WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD,

18:01.417 --> 18:04.625
AND SHE'S IN REMISSION.
SHE HAS A CHANCE TO HAVE A BABY,

18:04.667 --> 18:07.250
AND IF I CAN HELP HER--
WYATT IS NOT ABOUT
HELPING PEOPLE, NAI.

18:07.291 --> 18:10.417
HE'S ABOUT HELPING WYATT.
I'LL SEE.

18:10.458 --> 18:12.041
NAOMI.

18:12.083 --> 18:15.000
WHAT? I-I SAID THAT
I WOULD THINK ABOUT IT.

18:22.959 --> 18:26.250
(Addison) HEY.

18:26.291 --> 18:28.250
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
ADDISON?

18:28.291 --> 18:29.709
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

18:29.750 --> 18:32.250
I WENT BY MY HOUSE
TO STRAIGHTEN THINGS UP.

18:32.291 --> 18:33.709
THEY WERE STRAIGHT.

18:33.750 --> 18:35.750
SURPRISE.

18:35.792 --> 18:37.291
I WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.291
I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU
WORRYING ABOUT THINGS,

18:39.333 --> 18:43.125
SO I SENT MY HOUSEKEEPER OVER
TO TIDY THINGS UP.

18:43.166 --> 18:45.125
I-I DON'T NEED YOU
PAYING FOR ME.

18:45.166 --> 18:48.041
NO. NO, OF COURSE NOT.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.041
MY PLACE ISN'T DISGUSTING
AND PATHETIC.

18:50.083 --> 18:51.500
NO, I WASN'T SAYING THAT--

18:51.542 --> 18:54.542
I LIVE IN THE VALLEY.
IT'S NOT THE SLUMS.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.125
(cell phone rings)

18:56.166 --> 18:58.041
KEVIN--
(ring)

18:58.083 --> 19:00.041
OH.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.000
(ring)

19:03.375 --> 19:04.291
(ring)

19:04.333 --> 19:07.458
DR. MONTGOMERY.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.500
CARLEY?

19:09.542 --> 19:12.041
ARE YOU OKAY?

19:12.083 --> 19:16.000
BUT--NO, NO, NO, DON'T WORRY.
I'M--I'M GLAD YOU CALLED.

19:17.750 --> 19:19.709
YEAH, DON'T--THAT'S FINE.

19:19.750 --> 19:22.709
UH, UM, I CAN COME, AND I'LL
BE THERE AS FAST AS I CAN.

19:22.750 --> 19:24.750
BYE.

19:24.792 --> 19:26.542
EVERYTHING OKAY?

19:26.583 --> 19:29.542
IT'S ONE OF THE CALL GIRLS,
THE ONE THAT WAS MY PATIENT.

19:29.583 --> 19:32.083
A GUY HIT HER.
AND SHE'S CALLING YOU?

19:32.125 --> 19:34.291
SHE'S AFRAID OF THE POLICE.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
YOU'RE GONNA GO DOWN THERE?

19:34.333 --> 19:37.291
NO, LOOK, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU COULD BE WALKING INTO.
DON'T BE DRAMATIC!

19:37.333 --> 19:40.000
ADDISON, THIS IS WHAT I DO.
YOU DON'T KNOW THIS WORLD.

19:40.041 --> 19:42.333
IT CAN BE DARK AND UGLY.
YOU ARE MAKING
WAY TOO MUCH OUT OF THIS.

19:42.375 --> 19:45.041
HEY, YOU DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS
A CALL GIRL UNTIL TODAY.

19:45.083 --> 19:47.542
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
YOU WANT TO HELP HER,

19:47.583 --> 19:49.125
MAYBE YOU THINK YOU CAN
EVEN SAVE HER.

19:49.166 --> 19:51.333
BUT YOU'RE DABBLING IN A WORLD
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT,

19:51.375 --> 19:53.333
AND I'M NOT LETTING YOU
GO DOWN THERE ALONE.
WHOA, YOU'RE NOT GONNA LET ME?

19:53.375 --> 19:56.542
I'M COMING WITH YOU!
SINCE WHEN DON'T YOU
LET ME DO ANYTHING?

19:56.583 --> 19:58.542
ALL RIGHT, I AM NOT ABOUT
TO WALK IN THERE

19:58.583 --> 19:59.959
WITH HER WORST NIGHTMARE.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I'M GOING
AND I'M GOING ALONE.

20:12.041 --> 20:14.000
SO WHY AM I HERE AGAIN?

20:14.041 --> 20:16.041
BECAUSE KEVIN MADE ME
FEEL STUPID FOR GOING ALONE.

20:16.083 --> 20:18.041
KEVIN'S A COP.
IF HE SAYS IT'S DANGEROUS,

20:18.083 --> 20:21.166
DON'T YOU THINK HE'S A LITTLE
BETTER EQUIPPED TO PROTECT YOU

20:21.208 --> 20:23.041
THAN I AM?
YOU'LL BE FINE.

20:23.083 --> 20:25.041
SO ALL OF THOSE GIRLS,
ALL OF 'EM,

20:25.083 --> 20:28.041
THEY'RE...
THEY'RE CALL GIRLS?
WHAT IS IT WITH EVERYONE?

20:28.083 --> 20:29.458
THEY'RE... COLLEGE STUDENTS

20:29.500 --> 20:31.458
EARNING MONEY
IN AN INAPPROPRIATE WAY.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.250
THEY'RE JUST KIDS
THEY'RE STUDENTS.

20:33.291 --> 20:35.041
OF COURSE,

20:35.083 --> 20:39.000
MOST STUDENTS DON'T GET
BEAT UP BY THEIR JOHNS.

20:43.083 --> 20:44.417
SO WHAT ARE YOU
NOT TELLING ME?

20:44.458 --> 20:46.000
WHAT?

20:46.041 --> 20:49.250
WE'VE BEEN SITTING HERE
IN SILENCE FOR 20 MINUTES.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.709
OH, I'M--I'M SORRY.

20:50.750 --> 20:54.208
I WAS JUST, UH...

20:54.250 --> 20:55.875
WHAT IS WRONG?

20:55.917 --> 20:57.875
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO THROW YOURSELF

20:57.917 --> 21:00.041
OFF THE SIDE
OF THIS BUILDING.

21:00.083 --> 21:01.458
NO, I-I-I--IT'S NOTHING.

21:01.500 --> 21:04.417
I--JUST A ROUGH DAY AT WORK,
THAT'S ALL.
OKAY.

21:04.458 --> 21:07.500
OKAY?
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT WHATEVER IT IS,

21:07.542 --> 21:09.667
I'M NOT GONNA PUSH.

21:09.709 --> 21:11.959
WE'RE OKAY, RIGHT?

21:15.917 --> 21:18.041
YES, WE ARE.

21:18.083 --> 21:19.834
I MISSED YOU.

21:19.875 --> 21:21.333
GOOD.

21:21.375 --> 21:23.166
BECAUSE I MISSED YOU.

21:35.083 --> 21:36.458
(door opens)

21:36.500 --> 21:38.041
HOW IS HE?

21:38.083 --> 21:39.500
HE'S STABLE FOR NOW.

21:39.542 --> 21:42.458
THE PUMP FAILED. IT RELEASED
A SKY-HIGH DOSE OF INSULIN.

21:42.500 --> 21:45.875
IT'S BEEN REPLACED,
AND HE IS RESPONDING WELL.
THIS IS MY FAULT.

21:45.917 --> 21:49.458
I-I TRIED TO LOOK AFTER IT,
I TRIED TO KEEP IT CLEAN,

21:49.500 --> 21:51.667
BUT IT'S JUST SO HARD.
OKAY, HAVE A SEAT. UM...

21:51.709 --> 21:53.250
WHEW.

21:53.291 --> 21:55.166
(sighs)

21:55.208 --> 21:58.041
WHY'D YOU RUN? WHY DIDN'T YOU
GO TO THE POLICE?

21:58.083 --> 22:00.375
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO PROVE ABUSE,

22:00.417 --> 22:03.375
OR FOR A FATHER TO GET CUSTODY
OF HIS CHILD?

22:03.417 --> 22:05.375
I WASN'T
JUST GONNA SIT AROUND

22:05.417 --> 22:08.000
AND WAIT
FOR SOME LEGAL PROCEDURE

22:08.041 --> 22:10.291
WHILE MY SON WAS GETTING HIT.
YOU NEED TO TURN YOURSELF IN.

22:10.333 --> 22:12.000
AND THEN WHAT, HMM?

22:12.041 --> 22:14.291
WHO'S GONNA PROTECT MY SON
WHEN I'M IN JAIL?

22:14.333 --> 22:17.291
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO KNOW

22:17.333 --> 22:19.291
THAT YOUR SON IS BEING HURT

22:19.333 --> 22:21.291
AND THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO TO STOP IT.

22:21.333 --> 22:23.291
YOU--YOU CANNOT KEEP
THIS CHILD ON THE RUN.

22:23.333 --> 22:27.208
WELL, I'M NOT
TAKING HIM BACK.
IS THERE A PROBLEM HERE?

22:27.250 --> 22:30.208
NOTHING I CAN'T HANDLE.

22:30.250 --> 22:33.375
I'M GONNA
GO SEE MY BOY NOW.

22:43.458 --> 22:44.959
CARLEY?

22:45.000 --> 22:46.625
(weakly)
DR. MONTGOMERY?

22:46.667 --> 22:50.125
CARLEY, WHAT HAPPENED?

22:50.166 --> 22:53.417
THAT'S DR. BENNETT.
WE WORK TOGETHER.

22:53.458 --> 22:56.542
DID YOUR CLIENT
DO THIS TO YOU?

22:56.583 --> 22:59.333
YES. IT HURTS. (grunts)

22:59.375 --> 23:01.458
CARLEY, YOU SHOULD'VE
CALLED 9-1-1.

23:01.500 --> 23:05.041
I THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
A COUPLE OF BRUISES HERE.

23:05.083 --> 23:07.583
I DIDN'T WANT TO EXPLAIN.
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IN TROUBLE.

23:07.625 --> 23:09.583
I-I HAD YOUR NUMBER.
I'M S-SORRY. (gasping)

23:09.625 --> 23:12.417
YEAH, I NEED AN AMBULANCE
AT THE GRAND CAMDEN HOTEL,

23:12.458 --> 23:15.417
BEVERLY HILLS,
UH 8600 ROXBURY DRIVE,

23:15.458 --> 23:17.375
ROOM, UH, 210.
(gasps and groans)

23:17.417 --> 23:20.375
SHE'S GOT AT LEAST
TWO TO THREE FRACTURED RIBS.

23:20.417 --> 23:22.583
ONE'S PUNCTURING THE LUNG.
TENSION PNEUMO?

23:22.625 --> 23:25.792
(gasping)
I'VE GOTTA RELEASE THE PRESSURE
SO SHE CAN BREATHE.

23:25.834 --> 23:28.375
EASY, EASY.
HOLD ON.
JUST STAY WITH ME.

23:28.417 --> 23:31.041
YOU READY?
DO IT. DO IT.

23:31.083 --> 23:33.458
(exhales deeply)

23:37.083 --> 23:38.291
PLEASE, I'M OKAY.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.291
DON'T... LET THEM
TAKE ME TO THE HOSPITAL.

23:40.333 --> 23:43.041
THEY'LL CALL MY PARENTS.
YOU'RE OVER 18.

23:43.083 --> 23:45.458
THEY CAN'T CALL
UNLESS YOU REQUEST IT.

23:45.500 --> 23:48.875
I'M ON MY PARENTS' INSURANCE.
THEY'LL FIND OUT.
THEY NEED
TO LOOK AT YOU, CARLEY.

23:48.917 --> 23:51.041
(lowered voice)
WHEN YOU GET TO THE HOSPITAL,

23:51.083 --> 23:53.041
THEY'LL ASK FOR YOUR NAME
AND INSURANCE CARD.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.667
TELL THEM JANE DOE,

23:54.709 --> 23:58.417
AND IF YOU PAY IN CASH,
THEY CAN'T REFUSE YOU TREATMENT.

23:58.458 --> 24:02.458
(equipment whirs)

24:07.500 --> 24:10.333
THIS... IS... FOR YOU.

24:10.375 --> 24:12.333
"THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO."

24:12.375 --> 24:13.875
THANKS, DR. FREEDMAN.

24:13.917 --> 24:15.667
IF YOU LIKE
"THE THREE MUSKETEERS"...

24:15.709 --> 24:17.667
(clicks tongue)

24:17.709 --> 24:19.667
(laughs) THAT'S WHERE
I GOT PORTER,

24:19.709 --> 24:23.250
FROM PORTHOS,
MY FAVORITE MUSKETEER.
OH.

24:23.291 --> 24:25.333
I'M SORRY I LIED TO YOU.

24:25.375 --> 24:27.333
I'M SORRY
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH

24:27.375 --> 24:30.041
EVERYTHING
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.

24:30.083 --> 24:32.041
I'M SORRY YOUR MOM
DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU.

24:32.083 --> 24:34.542
ARE YOU GOING TO
CALL THE COPS?
WELL, HERE'S THE THING--

24:34.583 --> 24:36.041
YOU CAN'T KEEP LIVING
OUT OF YOUR CAR

24:36.083 --> 24:37.250
AND RUNNING
FROM PLACE TO PLACE.
MY DAD WILL GO TO JAIL.

24:37.291 --> 24:40.583
UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT PART'S NOT UP TO ME.

24:40.625 --> 24:44.125
I PROMISE YOU, I WILL DO
EVERYTHING I CAN TO HELP HIM.
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

24:44.166 --> 24:47.125
HE LISTENED TO ME. HE WAS
THE ONLY ONE WHO LISTENED TO ME.

24:47.166 --> 24:50.083
I'M ALL HE HAS.
HE'S ALL I HAVE.

24:50.125 --> 24:53.000
SO CAN'T YOU JUST...
LET US GO?

25:01.291 --> 25:03.959
(elevator bell dings)

25:04.000 --> 25:07.500
WYATT.
WHAT A SURPRISE.

25:07.542 --> 25:09.500
CLAUDIA JENKINS,
DR. NAOMI BENNETT.

25:09.542 --> 25:11.500
HE HAS SUNG YOUR PRAISES.

25:11.542 --> 25:13.542
YEAH, I FIGURED
YOU TWO SHOULD MEET.

25:13.583 --> 25:16.041
UH, WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
COME BACK TO MY OFFICE,

25:16.083 --> 25:19.041
AND WE'LL HAVE A TALK?
IF YOU HAVE TIME,
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

25:19.083 --> 25:20.750
YEAH, YEAH.
GREAT.

25:20.792 --> 25:22.959
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU TWO
ALREADY KNOW EACH OTHER.

25:23.041 --> 25:24.959
I'D LIKE TO TALK
TO CLAUDIA ALONE.
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
OKAY. SEE YOU.

25:27.041 --> 25:28.792
(chuckles)

25:30.458 --> 25:32.125
(Claudia)
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M HERE.

25:32.166 --> 25:34.959
I MEAN, THAT I'VE ACTUALLY
BEEN WELL ENOUGH LONG ENOUGH

25:35.000 --> 25:36.959
TO BE SITTING ACROSS
FROM A DOCTOR

25:37.000 --> 25:39.041
HAVING A DISCUSSION
ABOUT GETTING PREGNANT.

25:39.083 --> 25:42.041
WELL, YOUR RECOVERY HAS...
BEEN ASTOUNDING.
THANKS TO WYATT.

25:42.083 --> 25:45.333
EVERY OTHER DOCTOR I WENT TO
SAID THERE WAS NO TREATMENT.

25:45.375 --> 25:48.208
SOMETIMES I THINK HE CURED ME
BY HIS SHEER WILL.

25:48.250 --> 25:52.041
HE WOULD NOT LET ME GIVE UP,
AND I WANTED TO GIVE UP.

25:52.083 --> 25:53.834
HE'S TOUGH.

25:53.875 --> 25:55.166
YOU KNOW, I THINK

25:55.208 --> 25:58.583
HE MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY SCARED
THE CANCER AWAY. (laughs)

25:58.625 --> 26:00.458
UM...

26:00.500 --> 26:04.041
YOUR BODY HAS BEEN THROUGH
SO MUCH.

26:04.083 --> 26:07.041
AND--AND FERTILITY TREATMENTS
POST-CANCER...

26:07.083 --> 26:09.041
IT'S A LOT ON THE BODY.

26:09.083 --> 26:10.667
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO
GO THROUGH WITH ALL THAT?

26:10.709 --> 26:13.041
I MEAN, THERE--THERE ARE
OTHER OPTIONS.

26:13.083 --> 26:14.458
THERE'S ADOPTION
OR--OR SURROGACY.

26:14.500 --> 26:17.041
I WANT TO HAVE A BABY MYSELF.

26:17.083 --> 26:21.834
MY BODY ATTACKED ME,
AND I FOUGHT BACK AND I WON.

26:21.875 --> 26:23.917
I CAN DO THIS.

26:23.959 --> 26:25.041
I WANT MY LIFE BACK.

26:25.083 --> 26:28.667
I... I WANT MY DREAMS BACK.

26:28.709 --> 26:31.041
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

26:38.667 --> 26:42.458
I'M HERE AS A PATIENT.
I NEED YOUR PROFESSIONAL ADVICE.

26:42.500 --> 26:46.667
OH. OKAY. WELL,
LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN SO...

26:46.709 --> 26:48.458
OH, DOOR. GOOD. YEAH.

26:55.166 --> 26:56.041
OKAY...

26:56.083 --> 26:59.667
YOUR TIME WILL START...

26:59.709 --> 27:02.041
(exhales) NOW.

27:02.083 --> 27:04.750
I HAD DINNER
WITH MEG LAST NIGHT.

27:04.792 --> 27:06.750
IT WAS UNBEARABLE.
WHY WAS THAT?

27:06.792 --> 27:08.750
SHE KNOWS ME.
SHE READS ME.

27:08.792 --> 27:12.041
SHE KEPT ASKING ME
WHAT WAS WRONG.
WELL, WHAT DID YOU TELL HER?

27:12.083 --> 27:14.333
THAT NOTHING WAS WRONG.
AND YOU THINK YOU SHOULD'VE
TOLD HER SOMETHING ELSE?

27:14.375 --> 27:16.750
I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO YOU
THINK I SHOULD'VE TOLD HER?
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD HER?

27:16.792 --> 27:20.333
ARE YOU GONNA ANSWER
ALL MY QUESTIONS WITH QUESTIONS?
THAT'S WHAT THERAPISTS DO.

27:20.375 --> 27:22.500
THEN STOP BEING MY THERAPIST.
BE MY FRIEND.

27:27.417 --> 27:29.125
FINE.

27:30.542 --> 27:34.959
I THINK THAT...
TELLING ABOUT CHEATING

27:35.000 --> 27:36.500
ONLY MAKES THE CHEATER
FEEL BETTER.

27:36.542 --> 27:39.500
I THINK IT WOULD BE
A CRUEL THING TO PUT ON MEG

27:39.542 --> 27:41.500
IF YOU PLAN TO MOVE FORWARD
WITH HER.

27:41.542 --> 27:43.375
NOTHING GOOD
COULD COME OF IT.

27:43.417 --> 27:45.750
I-IF YOU PLAN ON
MOVING FORWARD WITH MEG,

27:45.792 --> 27:47.750
THEN YOU, AS THE CHEATER,

27:47.792 --> 27:51.917
NEED TO... SUFFER IN SILENCE
FOR YOUR CRIME.

27:51.959 --> 27:55.166
LIVE WITH THE GUILT
AND MOVE ON.

27:57.583 --> 27:59.542
THAT WAS AN AMBUSH.

27:59.583 --> 28:01.041
BUT SHE'S LOVELY,
ISN'T SHE?

28:01.083 --> 28:02.542
ADDISON WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU.

28:02.583 --> 28:03.959
TELL ME YOU WEREN'T MOVED.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.542
WHY ME? WHY ME?

28:05.583 --> 28:07.959
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF
FERTILITY DOCTORS IN THIS CITY.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.542
WHY ME?

28:09.583 --> 28:12.041
BECAUSE I DID MY RESEARCH,
AND YOU'RE THE BEST.

28:12.083 --> 28:15.041
AND IF CLAUDIA JENKINS WANTS
A CHANCE AT GETTING PREGNANT,

28:15.083 --> 28:18.041
SHE'S GONNA NEED THE BEST.
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE
THAT THIS IS MOTIVATED

28:18.083 --> 28:20.041
PURELY OUT OF COMPASSION
FOR YOUR PATIENT

28:20.083 --> 28:22.041
AND NOT FOR YOUR OWN
PERSONAL GAIN?

28:22.083 --> 28:24.333
I LIKE TO WIN. SO WHAT?

28:24.375 --> 28:26.375
I-I LIKE TO FIND NEW WAYS
TO CURE THINGS.

28:26.417 --> 28:28.375
I'M CHANGING THE WAY
WE CURE CANCER.

28:28.417 --> 28:31.041
THAT'S NOT EGO.
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

28:31.083 --> 28:34.041
TELL ME YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
A PART OF THAT.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.625
MM.

28:42.625 --> 28:44.625
HEY.

28:52.083 --> 28:53.583
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

28:53.625 --> 28:55.583
LIKE I GOT BEAT UP.

28:55.625 --> 28:58.458
YOU HAVE TO REPORT THIS,
CARLEY.
ARE YOU CRAZY?

28:58.500 --> 29:01.667
SO WHAT--WHAT, THIS GUY,
HE JUST GETS AWAY WITH IT?
I CAN'T RISK IT.

29:01.709 --> 29:04.041
TELL ME THAT YOU'RE NOT
GONNA DO THIS ANYMORE.

29:04.083 --> 29:06.458
HOW LONG
WILL THE BRUISES LAST?

29:06.500 --> 29:10.041
YOU NEED TO FIND ANOTHER WAY
TO MAKE MONEY.
IT'S ONE BAD INCIDENT.

29:10.083 --> 29:13.083
YOU WERE LUCKY LAST NIGHT.
HE COULD'VE KILLED YOU.

29:13.125 --> 29:15.208
IN A FEW MONTHS,
I'LL GRADUATE DEBT FREE.

29:15.250 --> 29:18.625
IN ANOTHER YEAR, I'LL BE ABLE
TO PAY FOR MED SCHOOL.
THAT'S NOT WORTH YOUR LIFE.

29:18.667 --> 29:21.625
I'M DOING IT SO I CAN BE
A DOCTOR LIKE YOU.
FIND A DIFFERENT WAY
TO GET THERE.

29:21.667 --> 29:24.709
DOING WHAT, WORKING FOR
MINIMUM WAGES AND TIPS

29:24.750 --> 29:26.667
AND DATING GUYS
WHO WANT TO SLEEP WITH ME

29:26.709 --> 29:28.458
BECAUSE THEY BUY ME A STEAK?

29:28.500 --> 29:31.041
AT LEAST THIS WAY,
I GET PAID WHAT I'M WORTH

29:31.083 --> 29:32.625
AND I CALL THE SHOTS.

29:32.667 --> 29:34.041
(sighs)

29:34.083 --> 29:37.208
HOW MANY PART-TIME JOBS
DID YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR SCHOOL?

29:37.250 --> 29:40.709
HOW MANY LOANS
DID YOU HAVE TO PAY BACK?

29:42.333 --> 29:44.291
I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

29:44.333 --> 29:45.875
IF YOU HAVEN'T STRUGGLED,

29:45.917 --> 29:48.041
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO COME FROM NOTHING,

29:48.083 --> 29:50.458
THEN YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.959
WHAT WOULD YOUR PARENTS SAY
IF THEY KNEW?
YOU CAN'T CALL THEM.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.959
I MAY NOT
BE IN MED SCHOOL YET,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.291
BUT I KNOW ALL ABOUT
DOCTOR-PATIENT PRIVILEGE.

29:57.333 --> 30:00.333
YOU'RE RIGHT. I CAN'T.

30:00.375 --> 30:03.667
BUT I AM TEMPTED.

30:03.709 --> 30:06.125
I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP,
DR. MONTGOMERY,

30:06.166 --> 30:07.750
BUT STAY OUT OF IT.

30:07.792 --> 30:10.458
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

30:15.834 --> 30:18.709
IF I CALL THE POLICE,
HE GOES BACK

30:18.750 --> 30:20.917
TO HIS MOTHER AND HER BOYFRIEND,
WHO ABUSES HIM,

30:20.959 --> 30:23.500
AND HIS FATHER,
WHOM HE REALLY LOVES,

30:23.542 --> 30:25.750
ENDS UP IN JAIL.

30:28.166 --> 30:30.500
THAT'S FUNNY.
HOW IS THAT FUNNY?

30:30.542 --> 30:33.041
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CALL
THE POLICE, BUT YOU'RE NOT.

30:33.083 --> 30:35.291
I WANT TO CALL THE POLICE,
BUT I CAN'T.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.291
I CAN'T EVEN CALL THE ONE COP
THAT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CALL

30:38.333 --> 30:41.291
'CAUSE HE'LL JUST SAY
"I TOLD YOU SO."

30:41.333 --> 30:44.542
MY COLLEGE CALL GIRL,

30:44.583 --> 30:47.000
SHE'S NOT GONNA QUIT.

30:49.083 --> 30:51.041
WHAT PEOPLE
DO TO THEMSELVES...

30:51.083 --> 30:52.750
YEAH.

30:52.792 --> 30:55.125
(exhales deeply)

30:55.166 --> 30:57.125
BUT I GUESS IT'S THEIRS
TO DO, RIGHT?

30:57.166 --> 30:59.125
I MEAN...

30:59.166 --> 31:01.417
WE CAN SAVE THEIR LIVES
PHYSICALLY,

31:01.458 --> 31:04.792
BUT WE CAN'T MAKE THEM
LIVE THEIR LIVES DIFFERENTLY.

31:04.834 --> 31:08.041
I GUESS IF WE'RE NOT THEM,
IF WE'RE NOT IN THEIR SHOES,

31:08.083 --> 31:10.041
WHO ARE WE
TO SAY WHAT'S BEST?

31:18.083 --> 31:20.875
I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA
DO SOMETHING BAD.

31:20.917 --> 31:22.375
EXCUSE ME?

31:22.417 --> 31:25.166
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING BAD.
WELL, NO, NO, NO. IT'S NOT BAD.

OH--

31:37.083 --> 31:39.041
WHAT, SLEEPING WITH HIM?
I'M SORRY. Y-YOU SAID THAT
IT WAS SOMETHING BAD

31:39.083 --> 31:41.375

31:41.417 --> 31:43.417

32:14.083 --> 32:16.834

32:16.875 --> 32:19.834

OH, CUT THE CRAP, COOPER.

32:19.875 --> 32:22.041

WHO THEY REALLY ARE.

32:22.083 --> 32:24.875
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO
CAN DO A LITTLE INVESTIGATION.

32:24.917 --> 32:26.875
PORTER'S SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER
WAS BOGUS,

32:26.917 --> 32:28.875
SO I RAN THE SERIAL NUMBER

32:28.917 --> 32:31.041

32:31.083 --> 32:33.875

32:36.083 --> 32:39.041

PLEASE TELL ME
YOU DIDN'T CALL THE POLICE.

32:39.083 --> 32:42.458

YOU DID THIS TO PUNISH ME
FOR BREAKING UP WITH YOU?

33:01.458 --> 33:04.041

33:04.083 --> 33:06.041
YOU NEED TO KEEP TRACK

33:06.083 --> 33:08.041
YOU NEED TO FILL THAT OUT
EVERY DAY,

33:08.083 --> 33:10.709
AND YOU NEED TO KEEP
THAT PUMP CLEAN.
I WILL.

33:10.750 --> 33:12.041
THERE'S A SERVICE ELEVATOR.
TAKE IT TO THE GROUND FLOOR.

33:12.083 --> 33:14.583
EXIT OUT THE LOADING DOORS.
HOW COULD I THANK YOU?

33:14.625 --> 33:20.125

IF YOU WANTED TO BE WITH
SOMEONE ELSE, WHY DRAG THIS ON?

35:24.083 --> 35:26.667
I'M SORRY.
YOU PUSHED ME AWAY
AFTER I WORKED HERE.

AFTER EVERYTHING?

36:04.750 --> 36:06.917

TO BE INSPIRED AGAIN.

36:06.959 --> 36:10.041

36:10.083 --> 36:12.041

I HAD LOST SOMETHING,

36:12.083 --> 36:13.375

36:13.417 --> 36:17.041
AND I DON'T WANT
TO FEEL LIKE THAT ANYMORE.

36:17.083 --> 36:19.625

36:19.667 --> 36:22.333
IT'S NOT JUST ONE PATIENT.
IT'S A...

36:22.375 --> 36:25.583
IT'S A STEP
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

36:25.625 --> 36:30.083
AND YOU TAKE THIS STEP,
AND SOON, PEOPLE ARE GONNA...

36:30.125 --> 36:32.417
NOT CALL THE POLICE
ON KIDNAPPERS

36:32.458 --> 36:35.041

SAM...

WHO SELLS OUT.

36:42.583 --> 36:44.208
