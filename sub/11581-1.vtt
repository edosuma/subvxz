00:01.302 --> 00:03.337
NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:03.371 --> 00:05.706
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.708
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:07.741 --> 00:09.743
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:09.777 --> 00:11.445
are members of an elite squad

00:11.479 --> 00:13.347
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.381 --> 00:16.016
These are their stories.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.454
Police Operator 5527.

00:20.488 --> 00:23.324
What's your emergency?

00:23.357 --> 00:26.160
Caller, can you hear me?

00:27.195 --> 00:29.430
Caller, can you hear me?

00:30.431 --> 00:32.300
What do you got?

00:32.333 --> 00:34.668
Hello, caller, are you there?

00:34.702 --> 00:36.137
Listen.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.138
( slaps, a woman screams )

00:37.171 --> 00:38.406
MAN:
Shut up!

00:38.439 --> 00:39.373
She must have dropped her phone.

00:39.407 --> 00:40.374
Just do what I say.

00:40.408 --> 00:41.275
I won't have to hurt you.

00:41.309 --> 00:43.277
What's the location?
I haven't got one.

00:43.311 --> 00:44.412
It's a cell phone.

00:44.445 --> 00:45.679
Only the number's coming up.

00:45.713 --> 00:46.314
Shut up, shut up.

00:46.347 --> 00:47.748
Start the car. Get going.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.150
WOMAN:
Okay, okay.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.451
MAN:
Come on, come on!

00:50.484 --> 00:51.319
Where do you
want me to go?

00:51.352 --> 00:53.121
Come on, honey,
tell us where you are.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.122
Which way?

00:54.155 --> 00:55.123
Take a right.
Take a right!

00:55.156 --> 00:56.124
Let's go.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.358
Please don't kill me.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.293
I'm not going
to kill you.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.462
I've got something
else in mind.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.464
Sweet mother of God.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.733
It's the carjack rapist.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.185
WOMAN:
Please don't kill me.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.187
( woman cries )

01:59.187 --> 02:00.221
That's it. There's dead air

02:00.254 --> 02:01.189
for a while,
then the call cuts out.

02:01.189 --> 02:03.391
We've been chasing this guy
for a month.

02:03.424 --> 02:04.625
He blitzes his
first four victims

02:04.658 --> 02:06.194
from behind, and then
he knocks them out

02:06.194 --> 02:07.795
before he rapes them
and steals their cars.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.363
Something must have
gone wrong this time.

02:09.397 --> 02:10.464
Yeah, he didn't dump her.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.333
Tape sounds like this victim
was right next to him.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.268
Which means that she's the
only one who can ID him.

02:14.302 --> 02:16.337
Now, is there any
way that you can
bring out his voice

02:16.370 --> 02:17.338
more clearly?

02:17.371 --> 02:18.339
No. Quality's too poor.

02:18.372 --> 02:19.440
She either dropped the phone,

02:19.473 --> 02:20.674
or it was in her purse
or pocket.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.710
I'll run a voice enhancement,
but it'll take a few hours.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.412
How about a fix
on her location?

02:24.445 --> 02:26.814
Well, the phone's
first three digits
are an exchange

02:26.847 --> 02:27.648
used by Cell Atlantic.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.450
Tech guy over there
says the call

02:29.483 --> 02:32.653
relayed off two different
cell towers.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.655
The first one's on Avenue A
and Sixth Street.

02:34.688 --> 02:37.491
STABLER:
And how many blocks
does that cell site cover?

02:37.525 --> 02:38.659
Houston to Seventh
to Avenue B.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.695
Then the call switched over
to the second tower here,

02:41.729 --> 02:42.496
south of Houston.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.432
Goes all the way
to the East River.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.700
Which means this could
have happened anywhere

02:46.734 --> 02:47.901
within 30 blocks.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.903
You know, if the city had
enhanced 911 for cell phones,

02:49.937 --> 02:51.772
we'd know exactly
where this happened.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.674
Would you settle
for a lead on who she is?

02:53.707 --> 02:54.742
We'll take whatever you got.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.944
Cell Atlantic says
the phone is one of 18 leased

02:56.977 --> 02:58.779
to the Studio Arts League.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.614
WOMAN:
Artists in residence

03:00.648 --> 03:01.782
spend most of their time

03:01.815 --> 03:03.484
teaching classes
in public schools.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.519
We give them phones
to keep them in touch.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.288
Whose cell phone number
is this?

03:07.321 --> 03:09.323
Um, let me check.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.260
Uh...

03:12.260 --> 03:13.427
Annika Bergeron.

03:13.461 --> 03:14.695
She's a painter.

03:14.728 --> 03:15.896
That's one of hers.

03:15.929 --> 03:17.731
Wonderful sense of color
and line.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.933
Why are you asking
about Annika's phone?

03:19.967 --> 03:21.569
BENSON:
We need
to see her.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.003
Do you know
where she lives?

03:23.036 --> 03:24.738
Over by Tompkins Square Park.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.707
Matches where
the call came from.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.743
Yeah. Um, has Annika come in
today?

03:29.777 --> 03:30.944
No.

03:30.978 --> 03:34.282
She's home on bed rest
for the last week.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.783
Why?

03:35.816 --> 03:38.419
Annika's pregnant,
due in two weeks.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.554
Doctor says high risk.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.793
MAN:
I don't know
where she could be.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.361
Doctor told her
to stay in bed,

03:47.395 --> 03:48.596
or she'd lose the baby.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.831
She's been taking his order
real seriously.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.967
Got an appointment card
for an OB/GYN, a Dr. Crespo.

03:54.001 --> 03:56.770
Who's been helping her out
since she's been on bed rest?

03:56.804 --> 03:58.005
This is a good building.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.673
Folks look out
for each other.

03:59.707 --> 04:00.941
Neighbors come by all day.

04:00.974 --> 04:03.777
Annika knows if she needs
anything at night to call me.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.479
When was the last
time you saw her?

04:05.513 --> 04:07.014
Checked on her last night
at around 9:00.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.516
Said she was going to sleep.

04:08.549 --> 04:09.683
She own a car?

04:09.717 --> 04:10.918
Big black SUV.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.052
Tahoe, I think.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.421
This doesn't add up.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.323
Pregnant woman
on bed rest doesn't go out

04:15.323 --> 04:16.824
for a drive
in the middle of the night

04:16.857 --> 04:17.858
without a good reason.

04:17.891 --> 04:18.792
Maybe she got a call.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.928
She went out to her
car, she got jacked.

04:20.961 --> 04:21.829
We'll pull the LUDs,

04:21.862 --> 04:24.898
see who she was talking to
last night.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.334
This Annika?

04:26.367 --> 04:27.401
Yeah. Pretty girl, huh?

04:27.435 --> 04:28.769
STABLER:
Baby's father around?

04:28.802 --> 04:31.439
I haven't seen any
guy come around here

04:31.472 --> 04:33.807
since Daniel moved
out last year.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.643
Daniel have a last name?

04:35.676 --> 04:36.710
Daniel Lester.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.045
Nice guy, carpenter.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.348
Always helped me fix stuff.

04:40.348 --> 04:41.815
They have any problems?

04:41.849 --> 04:43.016
Not that I saw.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.952
Then one day,
poof, he's gone.

04:44.985 --> 04:47.087
STABLER:
You know
where we can find him?

04:47.120 --> 04:48.556
Granville Developers.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.458
Big shot contractors
in midtown.

04:50.491 --> 04:51.892
MAN:
Annika's missing?

04:51.925 --> 04:53.627
Is there anything
I can do to help?

04:53.661 --> 04:55.829
STABLER:
The super says she drives
a black SUV,

04:55.863 --> 04:57.931
but we haven't been able
to find anything

04:57.965 --> 04:59.533
registered under her name.

04:59.567 --> 05:00.601
No. We never had a car.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.003
Annika must have bought it
after I moved out.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.473
Still in touch with her?

05:05.506 --> 05:06.607
Not much.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.610
She, uh, E-mailed me
a couple of times.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.778
Little things, like,

05:10.811 --> 05:12.413
did I want something
out of the closet.

05:12.446 --> 05:13.714
You know, that sort of thing.

05:13.747 --> 05:14.915
BENSON:
In any of those

05:14.948 --> 05:17.518
E-mails, did she mention a baby?

05:17.551 --> 05:18.619
No. What baby?

05:18.652 --> 05:19.853
Annika's pregnant.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.557
Really?

05:24.725 --> 05:25.859
When is she due?

05:25.893 --> 05:28.496
Soon, and we are concerned
about her medical condition.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.897
We need to speak with her
right way.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.399
WOMAN:
Daniel,

05:31.432 --> 05:32.566
I promised Melinda

05:32.600 --> 05:34.001
she could have your attention

05:34.034 --> 05:35.135
for a full five minutes.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.037
The florist needs
the final decision

05:37.070 --> 05:38.839
today.

05:38.872 --> 05:39.840
Uh, oh, I'm sorry.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.575
Uh, Jenny
didn't tell me

05:41.609 --> 05:43.143
that you were
in a meeting.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.845
This is Rose Granville,
my boss,

05:44.878 --> 05:47.014
and her daughter, Melinda,
my fiancÃ©e.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.550
Uh, Detectives Benson
and Stabler.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.018
MELINDA:
The police?

05:51.051 --> 05:52.686
What's wrong?

05:52.720 --> 05:56.624
My ex-girlfriend Annika
is missing.

05:56.657 --> 05:57.858
How long?

05:57.891 --> 05:59.760
BENSON:
Since last night. Uh,

05:59.793 --> 06:01.929
she made a 911 call
that we couldn't trace.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.030
ROSE:
Oh, that's terrible.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.532
We'll let you
finish talking.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.766
STABLER:
Well, we're
pretty much
done here.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.602
We do need contact information
for a family member, though.

06:08.636 --> 06:09.637
DANIEL:
Annika's parents

06:09.670 --> 06:10.771
are dead,

06:10.804 --> 06:12.973
but her sister, Laura,

06:13.006 --> 06:14.542
lives over in Jersey.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.577
Uh, Passaic County.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.014
WOMAN:
A-Annika doesn't own a car.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.015
The-the Tahoe's mine.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.552
I lent it to her.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.019
Did something happen
to my sister?

06:26.053 --> 06:27.087
STABLER:
It's possible
she was

06:27.120 --> 06:28.589
carjacked last night.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.757
Is she all right?

06:29.790 --> 06:30.958
We don't know.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.460
She's missing.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.063
Uh, oh, that doesn't really
make sense really,

06:36.096 --> 06:37.665
because if the car was stolen,

06:37.698 --> 06:38.832
where is she?

06:38.866 --> 06:40.067
She wouldn't just disappear.

06:40.100 --> 06:40.868
We're doing
everything

06:40.901 --> 06:42.202
that we can to
find your sister.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.937
Now, did you speak
with her last night?

06:43.971 --> 06:46.006
No. I-I spoke to her
a couple of days ago,

06:46.039 --> 06:47.475
and everything was fine.

06:47.475 --> 06:48.942
STABLER:
She left her
apartment

06:48.976 --> 06:50.043
in the middle
of the night.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.513
Is it possible she went
to go see the baby's father?

06:52.546 --> 06:53.881
As far as Annika's concerned,

06:53.914 --> 06:55.716
the baby doesn't have a father.

06:55.749 --> 06:59.019
She had a one-night stand,
and she never saw the guy again.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.154
Well, how does she feel
about being a single parent?

07:01.188 --> 07:02.690
She's 31.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.592
She always wanted a child.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.794
She didn't want to wait around
for Mr. Right.

07:07.995 --> 07:10.097
That baby is all
she talks about.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.767
FIN:
We canvassed Annika's block.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.569
The guy at the bodega
next door said

07:15.603 --> 07:17.037
he saw a black SUV
with Jersey plates

07:17.070 --> 07:19.573
parked in front of his store
all week till this morning.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.775
So, I got no car
and no witnesses.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.210
Look, pregnant women
are fighters.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.245
If Annika resisted, she
could be lying somewhere

07:25.278 --> 07:26.246
injured or unconscious.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.148
Or he freaked when he saw
she was pregnant,

07:28.181 --> 07:29.617
killed her, dumped the body,

07:29.650 --> 07:30.884
then took the car
to a chop shop.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.521
Well, let's just keep working it
like she is still alive, huh?

07:33.521 --> 07:34.522
Dr. Crespo's here,

07:34.522 --> 07:35.422
Annika's OB/GYN.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.090
I got a message from
a Detective Stabler.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.659
That's me. Thanks
for coming down.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.160
The doctor says that
we have a big problem.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.762
Annika can't deliver
the baby vaginally.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.531
She has a condition
called placenta previa.

07:43.531 --> 07:44.532
Meaning?

07:44.532 --> 07:45.533
The placenta's blocking

07:45.533 --> 07:46.567
the entrance to the birth canal.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.668
She's scheduled
for a C-section.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.869
What happens if Annika goes

07:48.902 --> 07:49.737
into labor before then?

07:49.770 --> 07:51.539
The baby tears
through the placenta,

07:51.539 --> 07:53.106
causing a massive hemorrhage.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.275
Annika bleeds out,
and the baby could die

07:55.308 --> 07:56.544
from lack of oxygen.

07:56.577 --> 07:57.678
FIN:
Okay, thanks
for the info.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.847
That was Morales.
He got something

07:59.880 --> 08:01.915
off the audio tape.

08:01.949 --> 08:03.250
MORALES:
I didn't get anywhere

08:03.283 --> 08:04.652
with the perp's voice,

08:04.685 --> 08:07.020
but I isolated
the background noises.

08:07.054 --> 08:09.256
Listen to this.

08:09.289 --> 08:11.559
( bell-like dinging )

08:14.294 --> 08:16.029
( engine turning over )

08:16.063 --> 08:17.665
It's the ignition
turning over.

08:17.698 --> 08:18.766
Exactly.

08:18.799 --> 08:19.833
Now they're driving.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.802
Based on the position
where the car was parked,

08:21.835 --> 08:24.137
they're headed south
on Avenue A.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.139
( rhythmic ticking )

08:26.173 --> 08:27.575
You hear that?

08:27.575 --> 08:28.375
Turn signal.

08:28.408 --> 08:31.111
Yeah. They're eastbound
on Houston.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.813
How do you know
they turned left?

08:32.846 --> 08:35.616
I fast forward a few minutes.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.818
One more turn signal,
and they're at the highway.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.620
( horn honking )
You hear the traffic?

08:39.653 --> 08:40.888
It's got to be FDR Drive.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.690
That's the only highway nearby.

08:42.723 --> 08:43.991
Any idea how far
they traveled?

08:44.024 --> 08:45.726
Listen to the echoes.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.895
( traffic noise )

08:49.229 --> 08:50.598
STABLER:
They're going

08:50.598 --> 08:51.999
under a bridge.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.901
So it's got
to be the Williamsburg,

08:53.934 --> 08:55.135
Manhattan or Brooklyn.

08:55.168 --> 08:56.604
BENSON:
Right.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.639
But which one?

08:58.672 --> 08:59.607
And then

08:59.640 --> 09:01.609
the engine stops.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.711
I'd say they're parked next
to the FDR.

09:03.744 --> 09:06.680
It's the only area
that matches these acoustics.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.683
This place is secluded
enough for a rape.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.985
So were the Williamsburg
and Manhattan bridges.

09:12.019 --> 09:12.853
No sign of her there.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.755
MAN:
Over here.
Find her, Barnaby.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.990
Find her, Barnaby. Find her.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.158
Find her, Barnaby.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.627
Find her.

09:19.627 --> 09:21.361
Good dog. Good dog.
Good dog.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.765
Your scent trail starts
at the curb, ends here.

09:24.798 --> 09:27.668
Definitely belongs
to your victim.

09:27.701 --> 09:28.902
So he dragged her over here?

09:28.936 --> 09:30.203
Check out the skid marks.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.639
There was another car here.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.240
You thinking
she was transferred?

09:33.273 --> 09:34.908
Could have had
a partner waiting.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.177
Well, he takes the woman,
but leaves the car.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.012
That's not
the carjack rapist's M.O.

09:39.046 --> 09:41.114
Well, he's graduated
from rape to kidnap.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.150
Maybe he wants more time
with his victim.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.752
Well, he went through
a hell of a lot

09:44.785 --> 09:45.853
of trouble
to arrange it.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.721
Look, if he took
Annika in another car,

09:47.755 --> 09:48.989
where's her SUV?

09:50.123 --> 09:53.060
Maybe it got towed to impound.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.763
No parking anytime.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.831
MAN:
Black Chevy Tahoe, towed

09:57.865 --> 09:59.066
from South Street and Dover.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.701
Slim Jim?

10:00.734 --> 10:01.702
There you go.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.737
I think we got
ourselves a
copycat here.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.072
Using a high-profile M.O.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.707
to send us down
the wrong track.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.041
Somebody targeted Annika.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.176
They called her.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.744
They lured her out
of the apartment,

10:10.778 --> 10:11.779
and they kidnapped her.

10:11.812 --> 10:12.980
This was planned.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.347
Got it.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.687
Seat's soaked with blood.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.790
WOMAN:
The victim's prints

10:22.823 --> 10:24.792
are all over the steering wheel.

10:24.825 --> 10:28.228
She drove, perp controlled her
from the passenger seat.

10:28.261 --> 10:31.098
His hand was here
on the back of her headrest.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.132
You lift prints?

10:32.165 --> 10:33.366
I wish.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.736
This bastard's smarter
than your average mutt.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.004
He was wearing
leather gloves.

10:37.037 --> 10:37.938
How did you get that?

10:37.971 --> 10:39.773
Well, animal hide has
a unique texture,

10:39.807 --> 10:40.708
plus the stitching

10:40.741 --> 10:42.843
along the seams
makes its own impression.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.411
I can match it
if you find the gloves.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.213
That's easy enough
once we find out who he is.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.681
You got anything to help us
with that?

10:47.715 --> 10:49.116
I'll have more in
a couple of hours.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.317
MAN:
This can't wait.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.451
STABLER:
What have you got?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.921
M.E. says the blood on the seat
is definitely Annika's,

10:53.954 --> 10:54.988
with cervical cells present.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.224
Good news is there's no trace
of amniotic fluid,

10:57.257 --> 10:58.391
so she's not in labor yet.

10:58.425 --> 10:59.392
So what's the bad news?

10:59.426 --> 11:00.761
I talked to Annika's doctor.

11:00.794 --> 11:01.862
Based on the amount of blood

11:01.895 --> 11:04.197
she's already lost,
he says she's got 36 hours tops

11:04.231 --> 11:05.799
before she
and the baby both die.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.907
If it's not the carjack rapist,

11:13.941 --> 11:15.075
what's the motive?
Don't know.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.143
Annika was
squeaky clean.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.745
No problems with
anyone we can find.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.212
Pregnancy elevates
a woman's risk

11:19.246 --> 11:22.082
of intimate partner violence,
including homicide.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.383
What do we have
on the baby's father?

11:23.416 --> 11:24.451
He was out of
the picture.

11:24.484 --> 11:25.385
According to her sister,

11:25.418 --> 11:27.087
Annika never told him
she was pregnant.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.756
Well, pregnancy could
still be a factor.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.057
There's a bunch of cases
nationwide

11:30.090 --> 11:32.225
where women are being snatched
for their babies.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.061
In which case,
he stashed her somewhere

11:34.094 --> 11:34.895
until she gives birth.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.396
And we don't find them
in 30 hours,

11:36.429 --> 11:37.765
she and the baby
are both dead.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.099
Look, if the perp
was after her baby,

11:39.132 --> 11:40.400
she didn't just find Annika
on the street

11:40.433 --> 11:41.769
at 3:00 in the morning.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.236
FIN:
You're right.
The LUDS are back.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.773
At 3:16, Annika got a phone call

11:45.806 --> 11:47.775
from a pay phone a block away
from her apartment.

11:47.808 --> 11:48.976
It lasted 50 seconds.

11:49.009 --> 11:49.977
That's 15 minutes

11:50.010 --> 11:51.411
before she called 911.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.513
Then an outgoing
call to a car service.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.082
Dispatcher remember her?

11:55.115 --> 11:57.150
They say a woman
called asking

11:57.184 --> 11:58.118
for an out-of-town fare.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.087
They sent a car,
but Annika never showed up.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.288
So she goes downstairs

12:01.321 --> 12:03.123
to meet the car, but
whatever she's got to do

12:03.156 --> 12:04.792
is so urgent, she
decides to drive herself.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.126
That's when he jumps her.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.027
Where the hell was she going?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.129
Before she left, the
last call she made

12:09.162 --> 12:12.199
was at 3:22 to her dial-up ISP.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.166
She went online.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.868
Yeah, I had Morales
look at her computer.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.104
She went to a
MapItNow Web site,

12:17.137 --> 12:19.272
downloading driving directions.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.108
Passaic County Hospital.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.442
Her sister lives in Passaic.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.144
Your sister calls,

12:24.177 --> 12:26.113
says she's hurt--
what would you do?

12:26.146 --> 12:27.114
You think

12:27.147 --> 12:28.816
I set up my own sister?

12:28.849 --> 12:30.117
I didn't call her.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.985
So it's just a coincidence
she was headed

12:32.019 --> 12:33.286
for your town in the
middle of the night.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.988
No, I can't explain it.

12:35.022 --> 12:36.289
I haven't even spoken
to her in weeks.

12:36.323 --> 12:37.457
Well, I thought you said

12:37.490 --> 12:40.160
that you talked to her
a few days ago.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.161
I lied.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.997
I was embarrassed.

12:44.031 --> 12:46.333
I had a fight with her,
and I-I hung up on the phone.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.236
Let me guess--
you fought over money.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.838
Oh, w-who told you?

12:50.871 --> 12:53.073
Well, the canceled checks
in Annika's apartment.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.843
She gave you
half her salary,

12:55.876 --> 12:57.377
even with the
baby on the way.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.146
Well, I-I-I was having
some cash flow problems.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.314
That's the
understatement
of the year.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.183
Credit cards are maxed out.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.185
Bill collectors have you
on the hot list.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.254
Bankruptcy looks
like a sure thing.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.022
My ex-boyfriend
was a real con artist.

13:09.056 --> 13:12.860
He ran up some major bills
and then skipped out.

13:12.893 --> 13:16.163
I-I-I made some mistakes
trying to get out of debt.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.331
Annika was helping me out.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.167
Why would I want her
to disappear?

13:20.200 --> 13:21.234
Well, maybe this boyfriend
of yours

13:21.268 --> 13:22.335
thought she was a cash cow.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.104
He wanted a little extra
for himself.
No, no, no.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.238
Bob is locked up in Arizona.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.340
He pulled the same scam
on the sheriff's baby sister.

13:27.374 --> 13:30.177
Now that leaves you all alone
in the jackpot, doesn't it?

13:30.210 --> 13:34.014
Listen, I am telling you,
I never called her.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.248
Someone must have made up
a story

13:35.282 --> 13:36.416
to just to get her
out of the house.

13:36.449 --> 13:39.186
Like the father
of the baby?

13:40.387 --> 13:43.323
I promised I would not tell
anyone about him.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.393
Your sister and the
baby are going to die
if we can't find her.

13:50.097 --> 13:52.065
Daniel Lester.

13:52.099 --> 13:54.201
It's her ex-boyfriend.

13:54.234 --> 13:57.604
That's the baby's father.

13:57.637 --> 14:00.273
You think I hurt Annika?
Did you?

14:01.408 --> 14:03.076
I can't believe this.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.211
I was in Boston.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.914
Here's my boarding pass.

14:06.947 --> 14:10.283
I stayed at the Ritz Carlton.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.284
Why would I

14:11.318 --> 14:12.119
do anything to her?

14:12.152 --> 14:13.053
Because she's carrying
your child,

14:13.086 --> 14:15.956
and you're about to marry
another woman.

14:15.989 --> 14:18.225
It's my baby?

14:18.258 --> 14:20.293
Are you sure?
Annika was.

14:20.327 --> 14:21.929
You two sleeping
together?

14:21.962 --> 14:23.230
No, but I love Melinda.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.098
Annika and I are through.

14:25.132 --> 14:26.166
STABLER:
Since when?

14:26.199 --> 14:27.367
You broke up 14 months ago,

14:27.400 --> 14:29.136
and she's eight months pregnant.

14:30.270 --> 14:34.141
Got to be some reason why
she thinks that baby's yours.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.112
It happened once.

14:39.146 --> 14:40.413
It was after we broke up.

14:40.447 --> 14:43.283
I went over
to Annika's apartment to...

14:43.316 --> 14:47.287
pick up some old receipts
for my taxes...

14:47.320 --> 14:49.422
and we had a glass of wine...

14:49.456 --> 14:51.424
and then another,
and we ended up in bed.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.993
It was stupid.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.427
We laughed about
it afterwards.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.129
Why'd you two break up?

14:56.163 --> 14:57.998
We fought about money.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.300
Rose Granville's got to be
paying you a pretty good salary.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.169
That was the problem.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.303
Annika said I was selling out.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.271
But you didn't.

15:04.304 --> 15:07.274
Look, my dad was a garbage man.

15:07.307 --> 15:08.976
He had six mouths to feed.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.278
Annika thought being
a starving artist was cool.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.380
I knew it wasn't the life
I wanted.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.615
Neither of us was
going to change our
minds, so we broke up.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.317
And Melinda didn't have
anything to do

15:17.350 --> 15:18.518
with that decision.
No.

15:18.551 --> 15:21.688
Annika and I broke up before
Melinda even knew who I was.

15:21.721 --> 15:24.124
Does your fiancÃ©e know
that you slept with her?

15:25.658 --> 15:27.494
No...

15:29.196 --> 15:30.998
..but I'm going
to have to tell her now.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.665
You don't have to tell me.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.568
So Daniel cut

15:35.602 --> 15:38.038
Annika loose, and
now he's marrying
the boss's daughter.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.506
This guy just hit
the Super Lotto.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.175
Bet an illegitimate child
would mess up his plans
to marry into money.

15:42.209 --> 15:44.477
Very least, it's going
to cost him a bundle
in child support,

15:44.511 --> 15:46.313
so he makes sure
that his pregnant ex-girlfriend

15:46.346 --> 15:49.182
disappears along
with their little secret.

15:49.216 --> 15:51.318
Boston's a four-hour
drive from here.

15:51.351 --> 15:52.652
Easy enough to fly up,

15:52.685 --> 15:54.354
check into a
hotel, drive here,

15:54.387 --> 15:56.023
kill Annika and
back to Boston.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.357
Great way to establish
an alibi.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.325
Playing it real well.

15:58.358 --> 16:01.028
Guess who's got
a rap sheet.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.030
Daniel Lester.
Bingo.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.364
Couple of
assault charges,

16:04.397 --> 16:05.665
mostly dismissed.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.500
One plea
to disorderly conduct.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.302
Your boy's got himself
a temper.

16:09.336 --> 16:12.205
CRAGEN:
All right, set up the hot line
phones over here

16:12.239 --> 16:13.206
and keep me informed.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.207
What's going on?

16:14.241 --> 16:16.343
Only 25 hours left.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.045
One P.P.'s going public.

16:18.078 --> 16:21.381
We're notifying
hospital ERs and
OB departments now.

16:21.414 --> 16:22.682
Press conference
in half an hour.

16:22.715 --> 16:25.418
Get Annika's face
on the morning news.
Why are we creating

16:25.452 --> 16:28.321
a media frenzy
when Lester looks
like our perp?

16:28.355 --> 16:30.357
Department isn't
prepared to call
him a suspect yet.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.059
They got a better theory?

16:32.092 --> 16:33.193
Annika was abducted
by somebody

16:33.226 --> 16:35.228
desperate for a baby.
You got to be
kidding me.

16:35.262 --> 16:36.396
We considered
that possibility.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.930
When we thought
it was a stranger kidnap,

16:37.964 --> 16:40.667
before we knew Lester
had a million-dollar motive
to get rid of his baby.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.702
The minute you get
me proof he's guilty,

16:42.735 --> 16:43.736
I'll take it to the brass.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.705
BENSON:
Well, who's going to cry
for the cameras?

16:45.738 --> 16:47.307
Annika's sister.

16:49.609 --> 16:53.246
Annika was here yesterday
at 3:15 a.m.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.248
getting into a black
Chevy Tahoe.

16:55.282 --> 16:58.085
If you've seen her,
please contact police.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.720
A tipline is open,
and all calls are confidential.

17:00.753 --> 17:03.523
( people shouting questions )
Please help my
sister and her baby.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.559
Bring Annika...
Elliot,
look who's here.

17:06.593 --> 17:10.263
Good morning,
Detectives.

17:10.297 --> 17:11.198
What can we do
for you?

17:11.231 --> 17:13.566
I would like to speak
to the reporters.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.268
Why?

17:15.302 --> 17:18.738
Granville Developers
is offering a $100,000 reward

17:18.771 --> 17:22.509
for information leading
to Annika's safe return home.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.277
That's very
generous of you,

17:24.311 --> 17:25.745
considering
that Annika's
baby is the child

17:25.778 --> 17:27.280
of your future
son-in-law.

17:27.314 --> 17:29.216
My daughter loves him.

17:29.249 --> 17:33.420
That matters far more to me
than one indiscretion.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.588
Melinda share
those feelings?

17:35.622 --> 17:37.190
There are two
innocent lives

17:37.224 --> 17:38.458
at stake.

17:38.491 --> 17:41.128
We want to do whatever
we can to help.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.463
REPORTER:
Mrs. Granville,
why are you here?

17:43.496 --> 17:44.564
Do you know the
missing girl?

17:44.597 --> 17:45.565
Annika Bergeron

17:45.598 --> 17:46.766
is a family friend.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.601
She's a lovely,
talented young woman

17:48.635 --> 17:50.603
with a promising
future.
They ripped a page

17:50.637 --> 17:51.704
from the O.J. playbook

17:51.738 --> 17:53.773
getting Rose to
post a reward for
the real killer.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.542
That guy's got
a set of brass
balls on him.

17:55.575 --> 17:56.609
Good distraction, though.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.378
We got over 500 calls
in less than three hours.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.280
Every bottom-feeder
in the city's after that reward.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.149
I got a psychic who claims
she could channel Annika

18:02.182 --> 18:03.150
for the right price.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.517
Let me guess--
she's in a cold, dark place

18:04.551 --> 18:05.518
near a body of water.

18:05.552 --> 18:06.653
I got one.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.489
A guy just called said he'd swap
information for Annika

18:09.522 --> 18:10.357
for the reward money.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.159
According to him,
she's still alive.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.460
Why do you think he's legit?

18:13.493 --> 18:15.595
Well, I asked
him the baby's
father's name,

18:15.628 --> 18:17.264
He came right back
with Daniel Lester.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.332
That was our holdback.

18:19.366 --> 18:20.633
Did you set a meet?
He did.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.170
Two hours at
pedestrian island,

18:23.203 --> 18:24.637
uh, Sixth and
Fourth Avenue.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.706
Let's go.
!
Hold up. He's
got one condition.

18:26.739 --> 18:30.177
He says Daniel's
got to bring the money.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.645
Stay with the detectives
at all times

18:32.679 --> 18:34.814
and follow their instructions
explicitly.

18:34.847 --> 18:35.815
I understand.

18:35.848 --> 18:36.816
Daniel, be careful.

18:36.849 --> 18:37.850
Don't worry.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.652
I'm not looking
to be a hero.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.188
Daniel's going
to be fine.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.555
Guy's got no
reason to harm him.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.357
Then why
the bulletproof vest?

18:44.391 --> 18:45.325
Just a precaution.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.726
We got people
covering the
entire area.

18:46.759 --> 18:49.196
That corner will be
the safest place

18:49.229 --> 18:49.996
in the city today.

18:50.029 --> 18:51.498
Once Daniel makes
the exchange,

18:51.531 --> 18:52.665
he just walks away.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.567
I have the money,
Detectives.

18:54.601 --> 18:55.535
MORALES:
I'll take the
briefcase.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.836
What about the FBI?

18:56.869 --> 18:57.704
Don't they handle this?

18:57.737 --> 18:59.706
They're already in place.
Trust me.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.374
We got everything
covered.

19:01.408 --> 19:03.443
You'll let us know
the minute this is over.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.477
CRAGEN:
You have my word.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.547
It's time to go.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.533
It's five after.
He's not coming.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.235
Be patient.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.702
What if he doesn't show up?

19:29.736 --> 19:31.238
Oh, he will.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.539
He's got 100,000
good reasons

19:32.572 --> 19:34.741
waiting for him.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.413
Two o'clock--

19:40.447 --> 19:42.249
black coat, ball cap.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.616
Is that him?

19:44.617 --> 19:45.585
We'll see.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.721
Take your positions.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.557
Here we go.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.605
Where's Annika?

20:05.638 --> 20:08.341
Give me the money.
Wait, you tell me
where she is.

20:09.642 --> 20:10.910
You bastard!

20:10.943 --> 20:12.779
( grunting )

20:14.347 --> 20:15.282
BENSON:
Look out!

20:15.315 --> 20:15.848
( horn honking )

20:15.882 --> 20:16.883
( grunting )

20:19.018 --> 20:20.553
( woman screaming )
I'm sorry.

20:20.587 --> 20:21.488
I freaked out.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.290
I just wanted to know
where he took her.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.557
Where is she?

20:24.591 --> 20:26.293
( groans )

20:26.326 --> 20:27.294
Where's Annika?

20:27.327 --> 20:28.761
Where the hell is she?

20:28.795 --> 20:29.629
Come on, talk to me.

20:29.662 --> 20:30.830
Where the hell is she?
Where's Annika?

20:30.863 --> 20:33.666
Come on, come on.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.607
He's gone.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.576
He didn't say a word.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.483
Our only lead
to Annika is roadkill.

20:50.517 --> 20:51.684
We're screwed.
Tipline's still ringing

20:51.718 --> 20:52.952
off the hook, but nothing solid.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.721
Prints on the dead guy
came back.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.690
Greg Jezic. Two-time
loser with a nasty past.

20:57.724 --> 21:00.493
Bunch of assaults, one murder
got plead down to man two.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.529
Parole officer said
he was muscle for hire.

21:02.562 --> 21:03.896
He used to break legs
for some loan shark

21:03.930 --> 21:05.732
till he did
his last bid upstate.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.534
Guy's a wannabe mercenary.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.769
Advertises in the back pages
of Soldier of Fortune magazine.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.904
"Have gun, will travel."

21:11.938 --> 21:13.606
Doesn't sound like
Jezic's the type

21:13.640 --> 21:14.707
to come up with this
on his own.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.776
Somebody paid him
to snatch Annika.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.778
Jezic does the job,
hears about the reward,

21:18.811 --> 21:20.347
and decides he wants
to get paid twice.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.381
BENSON:
Well, if he left Annika

21:21.414 --> 21:22.749
alone when he
came to the meet,

21:22.782 --> 21:24.551
she could be locked up,
bleeding out somewhere.

21:24.584 --> 21:27.887
Which leaves us with
about 19 hours left.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.822
John, Fin, keep going

21:29.856 --> 21:30.923
on Jezic's
background.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.792
Financials, LUDS,
known associates.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.094
Elliot, Olivia,
get a warrant for the apartment.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.763
Maybe something there
will tell us

21:36.796 --> 21:38.731
who paid Jezic
for the abduction.

21:41.668 --> 21:43.370
Police, open up!

21:49.542 --> 21:50.777
We're clear.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.945
What a dump.

21:52.979 --> 21:56.549
No blood trail.
Doubt she was ever here.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.918
Porno...

21:58.951 --> 22:00.553
Soldier of Fortune,

22:00.587 --> 22:02.655
more porno, Guns and Ammo.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.924
Well, Jezic's
a real Renaissance man.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.125
There's got to be
something here

22:06.158 --> 22:07.794
to lead us
to who hired Jezic.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.496
Hey, check this out.

22:09.529 --> 22:10.930
Annika.

22:10.963 --> 22:11.864
Telephoto lens.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.666
There's got to be dozens
of pictures here.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.935
Bastard's been
stalking her for a while.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.804
For a guy who lives like a pig,
he keep meticulous records.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.873
"2:17 PM, target returns
to apartment.

22:20.907 --> 22:24.444
4:16 PM, target goes to the
grocery store."

22:24.477 --> 22:27.580
When did you say the
surveillance started?

22:27.614 --> 22:29.816
I didn't, it...

22:29.849 --> 22:32.519
August 22nd.

22:32.552 --> 22:35.455
August 20th, Jezic received
a $5,000 wire transfer

22:35.488 --> 22:36.556
from Western Union.

22:36.589 --> 22:37.724
Guy works cheap.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.626
That's just
a down payment.

22:39.659 --> 22:43.830
Got another five Gs the day
before he snatched her.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.565
FIN:
The Western Union funds

22:45.598 --> 22:47.634
originated from an account
in the Cayman Islands.

22:47.667 --> 22:48.701
BENSON:
Whose?

22:48.735 --> 22:49.936
No names. Banks down there

22:49.969 --> 22:51.638
take privacy
very seriously.

22:51.671 --> 22:53.906
MUNCH:
Whoever paid Jezic,
they're not going to tell.

22:53.940 --> 22:54.774
In the Caymans,
even asking

22:54.807 --> 22:56.609
information about
an account holder

22:56.643 --> 22:57.910
is a crime.

22:57.944 --> 22:58.978
Guys, you've got
to give us something

22:59.011 --> 23:00.480
we can work with here.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.081
We may have a lead
on Jezic's LUDS.

23:02.114 --> 23:04.751
Day before the down payment,
Jezic got a long collect call

23:04.784 --> 23:05.985
from an inmate at Sing Sing.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.920
That's where Jezic
did his last jolt.

23:11.123 --> 23:13.860
MAN:
Inmates can only make collect
or pre-paid calls.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.828
Either way, they have
to key in their ID number

23:15.862 --> 23:17.464
before using the telephone.

23:17.464 --> 23:18.831
STABLER:
So who called
Greg Jezic?

23:18.865 --> 23:19.966
Sam Marlett.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.067
What's his story?

23:21.100 --> 23:23.970
No disciplinary infractions,
uh, doing six to eight

23:24.003 --> 23:25.071
for extortion.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.172
BENSON:
You know what
the con was?

23:26.205 --> 23:27.173
Yeah. He got
a stripper girlfriend

23:27.206 --> 23:28.508
to bang a married man,

23:28.541 --> 23:29.576
then he tried to blackmail him.

23:29.609 --> 23:32.945
The mark had balls and he
reported the shakedown.

23:32.979 --> 23:34.947
He have any visitors
since coming upstate?

23:34.981 --> 23:37.917
That's easy enough to check.

23:37.950 --> 23:38.985
One.

23:39.018 --> 23:40.019
Daniel Lester.

23:40.052 --> 23:41.120
When?

23:41.153 --> 23:43.590
About a month ago.

23:43.623 --> 23:45.224
I got nothing to say to you.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.225
So just listen.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.159
This is Annika Bergeron,

23:47.193 --> 23:49.028
your buddy Daniel Lester's
ex-girlfriend--

23:49.061 --> 23:50.062
the one he asked
you to help him

23:50.096 --> 23:51.230
get rid of.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.899
I don't know what
you're talking about.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.567
BENSON:
Look, we know that
Daniel came to see you.

23:54.601 --> 23:56.068
He tells you about his problem,

23:56.102 --> 23:59.038
so you reach out to your
old cellmate, Greg Jezic,

23:59.071 --> 24:01.908
who he hired to kidnap
a vulnerable pregnant woman

24:01.941 --> 24:02.975
who never hurt a soul
in her life.

24:03.009 --> 24:06.145
I haven't talked to Jezic
since he made parole.

24:06.178 --> 24:07.547
How's he doing?
He's dead,

24:07.580 --> 24:08.881
asswipe.

24:08.915 --> 24:11.551
He got greedy, so Daniel
shoved him under a car.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.520
Daniel's doing a very nice job
of keeping his hands clean,

24:13.553 --> 24:15.054
which leaves you
holding the bag.

24:15.087 --> 24:17.557
So you want me
to give Daniel up.

24:17.590 --> 24:18.558
Smart guy.

24:18.591 --> 24:19.726
Screw you.

24:19.759 --> 24:22.228
Daniel's not worth adding 25
to life to your sentence.

24:22.261 --> 24:23.630
He's the only
family I got.

24:23.663 --> 24:25.965
Daniel never stopped
looking out for me.

24:25.998 --> 24:28.968
He even got me a job in the mail
room at Granville Developers

24:29.001 --> 24:30.737
before I screwed up again.

24:30.770 --> 24:31.971
He never
gave up on me,

24:32.004 --> 24:33.640
I'm not giving up
on him.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.542
So you're going
to take the fall?
Yeah.

24:35.542 --> 24:37.810
I'll die in here before
I say one word against him.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.111
Kidnap murder conviction

24:39.145 --> 24:40.680
will make that wish
come true.

24:40.713 --> 24:41.881
Lethal injection.

24:41.914 --> 24:43.082
Yo, C.O., I want
to go back to my cell.

24:43.115 --> 24:43.950
Look, this is your
last chance

24:43.983 --> 24:46.052
to save Annika's life
and your friend

24:46.085 --> 24:47.854
from a capital charge.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.556
Go to hell.
You're right.

24:49.589 --> 24:50.990
Friends should
stick together.

24:51.023 --> 24:52.992
You and Daniel can share
a cell on death row.

24:53.025 --> 24:54.026
Warden's orders.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.562
He's going straight
to the hole,

24:55.595 --> 24:56.563
no phone privileges.

24:56.563 --> 24:57.964
We wouldn't want you
warning your old pal

24:57.997 --> 25:01.601
that we're coming for him.

25:01.634 --> 25:03.069
Daniel would never hurt anyone.

25:03.102 --> 25:05.004
"Stand by Your Man"
sounds much better

25:05.037 --> 25:06.573
when Tammy Wynette sings it.

25:06.606 --> 25:07.940
You're wrong.
That right?

25:07.974 --> 25:10.209
How much do your know
about your fiancÃ©?

25:10.242 --> 25:12.679
I know he is a good,
kind, gentle, man.

25:12.712 --> 25:13.980
Two arrests
for assault.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.816
He was a kid,
he got in some bar fights.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.918
A couple of nights in jail
does not make him a monster.

25:18.951 --> 25:19.952
But he's got

25:19.986 --> 25:20.920
friends who are.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.254
Sam Marlett's got one
hell of a rap sheet.

25:22.288 --> 25:24.290
Sam from
the mail room?

25:24.323 --> 25:25.157
Daniel's trying to help him

25:25.191 --> 25:26.993
straighten out his life.
Is that a crime?

25:27.026 --> 25:27.860
Daniel's a real
saint, huh?

25:27.894 --> 25:30.597
He tell you how Marlett
paid him back?

25:30.630 --> 25:32.599
I don't know
what you're talking about.
Sam Marlett

25:32.632 --> 25:35.334
arranged Annika's kidnapping.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.502
That can't be true.

25:36.603 --> 25:39.171
I guess you don't
know Daniel as
well as you think.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.940
Look what we found.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.942
"Invest in Paradise:
A Guide to Tax-Free

25:42.975 --> 25:45.211
Confidential Cayman Islands
Banking."

25:45.244 --> 25:46.846
Brochure's from
the same bank

25:46.879 --> 25:48.014
the payment
to Jezic came from.

25:48.047 --> 25:51.117
We found it
in Daniel's desk.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.852
Melinda, where's
Daniel now?

25:52.885 --> 25:54.153
I don't know.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.988
STABLER:
Two innocent people
are going to die.

25:56.022 --> 25:58.090
Do you understand that?

26:01.694 --> 26:04.897
He's at the new building site.

26:04.931 --> 26:06.265
ROSE:
Make sure you check
the shipment carefully.

26:06.298 --> 26:07.767
No problem, Rose.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.969
Detectives,
any news about Annika?

26:10.002 --> 26:10.937
You can drop
the act.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.672
What?
Put your hands
behind your back.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.340
Hey! What are you doing?
This is a mistake!

26:14.373 --> 26:15.808
No, it's not.
What's going on here?

26:15.842 --> 26:17.076
Daniel Lester,
you're under arrest

26:17.109 --> 26:19.045
for the kidnapping
of Annika Bergeron.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.080
You have the right
to remain silent...
Don't say a word,

26:21.113 --> 26:24.350
I'll call my lawyer...

26:26.919 --> 26:28.254
I didn't kidnap Annika.

26:28.287 --> 26:29.889
Cause you didn't want to get
your hands dirty.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.291
So you paid Greg Jezic
to do the dirty work.

26:32.324 --> 26:33.259
Who?

26:33.292 --> 26:37.396
Greg Jezic, the guy
you pushed under a car?

26:37.429 --> 26:38.898
That was an accident.

26:38.931 --> 26:39.899
And it's an accident

26:39.932 --> 26:41.133
that he's the ex-cellmate

26:41.167 --> 26:42.669
to your best friend,
Sam Marlett?

26:42.669 --> 26:45.304
Sam? What's Sam
got to do with this?

26:45.337 --> 26:46.272
Don't play games
with me,

26:46.305 --> 26:48.340
I'm about 30 seconds
from shoving your face

26:48.374 --> 26:49.475
right though that wall.

26:49.508 --> 26:51.678
I swear, I don't know
what you guys are talking about.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.045
Come on,
sure you do.

26:53.079 --> 26:54.847
You wanted Annika
out of the picture,

26:54.881 --> 26:57.684
so she wouldn't get into the way
of your plans to marry

26:57.717 --> 26:59.786
into more money than you could
have made in ten lifetimes.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.287
You cry on Sam
Marlett's shoulder,

27:01.320 --> 27:02.689
so he finds Jezic for you.

27:02.722 --> 27:04.056
While you're conveniently
out of town,

27:04.090 --> 27:05.858
Jezic lures Annika
out of the house

27:05.892 --> 27:07.393
and fakes
a carjacking.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.128
But you screwed up,
Daniel.

27:09.161 --> 27:11.363
That reward you offered
was a little bit too tempting.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.700
A hundred grand sounded
mighty good to Jezic,

27:13.700 --> 27:15.401
who you only paid

27:15.434 --> 27:16.703
ten grand for
the original job.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.237
Jezic's no fool.

27:18.270 --> 27:19.939
He asks you
to bring him the money

27:19.972 --> 27:21.741
so if things go wrong,
he just gives you up.

27:21.774 --> 27:23.209
But we know what
you did to Jezic, right?

27:23.242 --> 27:24.443
No!

27:24.476 --> 27:25.845
This is insane.

27:25.878 --> 27:27.346
I've never met that man before
in my life.

27:27.379 --> 27:28.347
Daniel,

27:28.380 --> 27:31.317
the payments to Jezic
came from the same bank

27:31.350 --> 27:33.720
in the Cayman Islands
where you do your business.

27:33.720 --> 27:36.355
We found the brochures
in your house.

27:45.131 --> 27:47.333
Where's Annika?

27:49.368 --> 27:51.137
I don't know.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.775
Is she alive?

27:58.477 --> 28:00.246
I don't know.

28:00.279 --> 28:02.048
Daniel...

28:02.081 --> 28:04.450
Annika' going to die.

28:04.483 --> 28:07.419
That baby is going to die.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.455
That baby is your baby.

28:15.928 --> 28:18.798
Yeah, you're right.

28:18.831 --> 28:20.299
I did it.

28:22.301 --> 28:23.936
I'm so sorry.
Okay, Daniel,

28:23.970 --> 28:25.271
it's not too late to fix this,

28:25.304 --> 28:26.839
just tell us where Annika is,

28:26.873 --> 28:28.040
and we can get to her in time.

28:28.074 --> 28:29.441
I don't know where he took her.

28:29.475 --> 28:30.777
Yes, you do.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.244
Yeah, you do,
just tell us.

28:32.278 --> 28:35.147
I wish I could.

28:35.181 --> 28:37.216
( knocking on door )

28:37.249 --> 28:39.285
If she dies because
you're holding out on us,

28:39.318 --> 28:40.953
I will personally stick
that needle in your arm

28:40.987 --> 28:42.922
myself, you little prick.

28:43.990 --> 28:45.925
I thought he was going to go
for it at the end there.

28:45.958 --> 28:46.993
Why'd you pull me
out of there?

28:47.026 --> 28:48.895
You didn't think I was
going to hit him, did you?

28:48.928 --> 28:49.962
I know your act, Elliot.

28:49.996 --> 28:52.398
Rose Granville
is in my office.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.401
You've arrested the wrong man.

28:55.434 --> 28:56.903
Daniel couldn't have done this.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.437
Well, with all
due respect, Mrs. Granville,

28:58.470 --> 29:00.973
he just confessed.

29:01.007 --> 29:03.910
That's impossible.

29:03.943 --> 29:06.412
Did he say why he did it?

29:06.445 --> 29:08.547
Marrying your daughter is...

29:08.580 --> 29:10.416
quite a lucky break
for a boy

29:10.449 --> 29:12.384
from the wrong side
of the tracks.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.053
Overnight, he makes
the A list.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.088
Daniel loves Melinda.

29:16.122 --> 29:17.957
He would never marry her
for her money.

29:17.990 --> 29:19.892
I made sure of that.

29:19.926 --> 29:21.060
So you were concerned?

29:21.093 --> 29:22.361
Of course.

29:22.394 --> 29:25.832
I made a mistake marrying
Melinda's father.

29:25.832 --> 29:27.834
I wasn't going to let
history repeat itself.

29:27.834 --> 29:29.435
He left you?

29:29.468 --> 29:31.570
With half my money
and my secretary.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.505
Daniel isn't like that.

29:33.539 --> 29:36.375
You had him
checked out.

29:36.408 --> 29:39.578
A woman in my position
has to protect her family.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.247
Did your private detective
find anything?

29:41.280 --> 29:42.949
No, he's devoted
to my daughter.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.483
He cheated on your daughter.

29:44.516 --> 29:46.285
She forgave him.

29:46.318 --> 29:47.519
So did I.

29:47.553 --> 29:49.288
But he didn't know
you would.

29:49.321 --> 29:50.589
Why would he risk that

29:50.622 --> 29:52.558
when he could just make
the problem disappear?

29:52.591 --> 29:54.426
Daniel is not capable
of violence.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.561
He killed the man

29:55.594 --> 29:56.996
who kidnapped Annika.

29:57.029 --> 29:59.065
That was a freak accident.

29:59.098 --> 29:59.932
You're railroading him

29:59.966 --> 30:01.968
based on your fantasy
of who he is.

30:02.001 --> 30:04.370
Yes, Daniel grew up poor,

30:04.403 --> 30:07.406
but he would never kill
anyone to get rich.

30:07.439 --> 30:09.575
Ma'am, you're entitled
to your opinion,

30:09.608 --> 30:11.610
but we're running out of time.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.512
Now, Daniel does know
where Annika is,

30:13.545 --> 30:15.915
and if he doesn't tell us,
she dies.

30:20.052 --> 30:23.522
I can see
that I can't convince you.

30:23.555 --> 30:26.959
Perhaps my lawyer
can persuade

30:26.993 --> 30:30.296
the district attorney
not to file charges.

30:30.329 --> 30:33.032
He went to law school
with him.

30:33.065 --> 30:34.533
Good-bye, gentlemen.

30:34.566 --> 30:37.136
STABLER:
She's definitely
going to put

30:37.169 --> 30:38.470
her money where her mouth is.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.539
Without more evidence,
we don't have a chance

30:40.572 --> 30:42.174
against the legal
team she'll buy him.

30:42.208 --> 30:43.642
( knocking )
FIN:
Lab just called.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.611
They may have something
that'll help.

30:49.215 --> 30:50.917
WOMAN:
Warner sent over
Jezic's clothes

30:50.950 --> 30:52.151
from the morgue.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.619
Found this
in his pants pocket.

30:53.652 --> 30:54.620
Looks like a receipt.

30:54.653 --> 30:56.588
Took me an hour
to unfold without shredding it.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.490
There's too much blood.
It's illegible.

30:58.524 --> 30:59.491
To the naked eye.

30:59.525 --> 31:00.492
That's why God invented lasers.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.561
Different frequencies
reveal different inks.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.263
Who knew?
Kill the lights.

31:05.264 --> 31:06.398
We'll start

31:06.432 --> 31:08.434
at 400 nanometers.

31:11.137 --> 31:12.604
STABLER:
Nothing.

31:12.638 --> 31:14.941
Trying 500.

31:18.144 --> 31:20.079
Still nothing.

31:20.112 --> 31:21.280
Let's see what 600 does.

31:24.350 --> 31:25.484
I'll be damned.

31:25.517 --> 31:26.953
I can read that clear as day.

31:26.986 --> 31:27.954
FIN:
Gas receipt.

31:27.954 --> 31:30.622
Jezic tanked up an
hour before the meet.

31:30.656 --> 31:32.959
STABLER:
Moe's Gas 'n' Go
in the Rockaways.

31:32.959 --> 31:34.526
I know that place.
It's out by the beach.

31:34.560 --> 31:35.527
I used to spend

31:35.561 --> 31:37.029
my summers there.
Let's go.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.297
MAN:
Sure, I seen him.

31:38.330 --> 31:39.298
When?

31:39.331 --> 31:40.632
Yesterday, maybe
the day before.

31:40.666 --> 31:41.700
Drove a black Mustang.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.269
Nice car, but beat to hell.

31:43.302 --> 31:44.670
You know which
way he came from?

31:44.703 --> 31:45.671
Not the bridge,
that's for sure.

31:45.704 --> 31:48.007
Plenty of service stations
closer than mine.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.641
That's why my business
is in the toilet.

31:49.675 --> 31:51.543
Guy wanted privacy,
you know, no neighbors,

31:51.577 --> 31:53.479
there a place around
here he might hole up?

31:53.512 --> 31:56.715
There's a couple of old cottages
on the beach around the point.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.617
Pretty deserted out there
after Labor Day.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.252
This way, right?
Yeah.

32:00.286 --> 32:01.988
Hey, you won't make it
in that car.

32:02.021 --> 32:05.992
Take my truck.

32:06.025 --> 32:08.160
( seagulls cawing )

32:15.334 --> 32:17.469
No cars, no signs of life.

32:19.605 --> 32:22.108
Could be any one of these.

32:22.141 --> 32:23.409
I'll call for backup.

32:23.442 --> 32:24.676
WOMAN:
Hello?

32:24.710 --> 32:26.645
Did you hear that?

32:26.678 --> 32:29.281
Please...

32:29.315 --> 32:31.417
Please!

32:33.019 --> 32:35.721
Help!

32:35.754 --> 32:39.058
Please help.

32:39.091 --> 32:40.259
Help me.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.294
All set?

32:44.530 --> 32:47.033
( woman gasping and whimpering )

32:50.102 --> 32:52.138
( woman groaning softly )

32:52.171 --> 32:54.040
( woman groaning )

32:54.040 --> 32:55.341
Annika, the police.

32:55.374 --> 32:56.675
Anyone in the house?
No.

32:56.708 --> 32:58.344
All right, you're going
to be fine.

32:58.377 --> 32:59.678
We're going to get
you out of here.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.047
SVU Detectives

33:01.047 --> 33:03.049
to Central, Kay, 10-54

33:03.049 --> 33:05.051
on the sand at
Beach, 139th Street.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.318
We have a
woman in labor

33:06.352 --> 33:07.753
with complications.
Please

33:07.786 --> 33:08.754
don't let my
baby die.

33:08.787 --> 33:10.689
No one's going
to be dying around here, okay?

33:10.722 --> 33:12.091
Just relax.

33:12.124 --> 33:13.692
Bus is going to be
at least ten minutes.

33:13.725 --> 33:15.061
All right.

33:15.094 --> 33:16.495
How long have you been in labor?

33:16.528 --> 33:18.064
All day.

33:18.097 --> 33:20.066
( whispering ):
Placenta's almost out.

33:20.066 --> 33:22.801
If she loses any more blood,
they're both going to be dead.

33:22.834 --> 33:23.802
I think my baby's coming.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.104
Don't push.
You can't do that.

33:25.137 --> 33:26.205
The ambulance isn't here.

33:26.238 --> 33:27.239
You got to wait for it.

33:27.273 --> 33:29.375
I don't want my baby to die.

33:29.408 --> 33:30.242
Annika, listen to me.

33:30.276 --> 33:32.078
If you give birth
to that baby now,

33:32.111 --> 33:33.279
you're going to bleed to death.

33:33.312 --> 33:36.148
Please.

33:36.182 --> 33:38.817
I want you to save my baby.

33:38.850 --> 33:42.488
Please save
my baby. Please...

33:42.521 --> 33:43.689
Go out to the truck.

33:43.722 --> 33:45.324
See if they got
a first aid kit.

33:45.357 --> 33:46.825
And a flashlight.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.095
And get the newspaper
off the front seat.

33:50.496 --> 33:52.631
All right, Annika,
it's just you and me, all right?

33:52.664 --> 33:54.766
Have you done this before?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.635
I got four kids of my own.

33:56.668 --> 33:59.438
I helped deliver each
and every one of them.

33:59.471 --> 34:01.373
How many girls?

34:01.407 --> 34:03.342
Three. One boy.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.111
I'm having a girl.

34:05.111 --> 34:06.845
No flashlight
or first aid kit.

34:06.878 --> 34:09.115
Get me a light,
get me a light.

34:09.115 --> 34:10.349
Okay, you're doing great.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.118
You're doing great.

34:12.118 --> 34:12.851
I'm so tired.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.353
You hold on, all right?

34:14.386 --> 34:15.521
Stay with me.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.489
You gotta do this,
Annika, okay?

34:18.524 --> 34:20.126
Placenta's almost out.

34:20.126 --> 34:22.128
Keep her talking,
keep her talking.

34:22.128 --> 34:23.729
Annika, come on, baby,
stay with me.

34:23.762 --> 34:25.131
Tell me about your baby.

34:25.131 --> 34:27.466
Her name is Celia.

34:27.499 --> 34:28.667
After my mother.

34:28.700 --> 34:30.169
That's a pretty name.

34:30.202 --> 34:31.637
Almost here.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.172
You've got to tell Daniel.

34:33.205 --> 34:34.540
Daniel already knows.

34:34.573 --> 34:36.408
Melinda wasn't supposed
to say anything.

34:36.442 --> 34:37.509
Melinda?

34:37.543 --> 34:39.311
She came by to see me.

34:39.345 --> 34:41.313
Oh, God.

34:41.347 --> 34:43.149
Breathe.

34:43.149 --> 34:44.250
Now push.

34:45.717 --> 34:46.852
Breathe.

34:46.885 --> 34:48.820
Breathe.

34:48.854 --> 34:49.855
( tired breath )

34:49.888 --> 34:51.190
Now push.

34:51.223 --> 34:52.758
Push!

34:52.791 --> 34:53.825
Give me the newspaper.

34:53.859 --> 34:54.826
( Annika crying )

34:54.860 --> 34:55.694
Oh, God.

34:55.727 --> 34:57.663
One more push, Annika,
one more push.

34:57.696 --> 34:58.664
( loud groan )

34:58.697 --> 35:00.832
Oh, God!

35:00.866 --> 35:03.369
( baby crying )

35:14.913 --> 35:17.183
Is my baby okay?

35:18.684 --> 35:20.686
She's perfect.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.831
Hello, Celia.

35:37.336 --> 35:39.405
I love you, baby girl.

35:39.438 --> 35:42.341
Yeah.

35:43.775 --> 35:45.377
Annika, the man
who brought you here--

35:45.411 --> 35:46.612
did he say why he took you?

35:46.645 --> 35:49.848
She paid him to.

35:49.881 --> 35:51.917
Who paid him?

35:51.950 --> 35:54.253
No.

35:54.286 --> 35:55.754
( sirens approaching )

35:55.787 --> 35:57.456
I'm losing her pulse.
Annika?

35:57.489 --> 35:58.957
Annika, you got to hold on.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.592
Help is almost here. Hold on.

36:00.626 --> 36:02.528
( soft groan )
Annika, look at me.

36:02.561 --> 36:04.630
Look at me.
Open your eyes.

36:05.764 --> 36:08.334
( quietly ):
Here's your baby.

36:08.367 --> 36:09.635
Here's your baby.

36:09.668 --> 36:12.238
( sirens blaring )

36:24.383 --> 36:26.352
Why was I brought here?

36:26.385 --> 36:28.620
Because there's somebody
that you need to see.

36:28.654 --> 36:29.988
Annika? You found her?

36:30.021 --> 36:31.423
Can I see her?

36:31.457 --> 36:33.992
Drop the act, Daniel.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.627
I know that you didn't do this.

36:35.661 --> 36:36.595
I told you.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.697
I wanted Annika and the baby
out of the way

36:38.730 --> 36:39.831
so I could marry Melinda.

36:39.865 --> 36:40.832
Stop protecting her.

36:40.866 --> 36:41.867
Who?

36:41.900 --> 36:44.002
Melinda.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.605
Annika told us everything.

36:46.638 --> 36:48.640
Before she died.

36:50.942 --> 36:53.412
She told us that
you didn't know
about the baby.

36:53.445 --> 36:55.614
But Melinda did.

36:55.647 --> 36:56.948
Melinda had nothing
to do with this.

36:56.982 --> 36:58.284
It was me. I'm responsible.

36:58.317 --> 36:59.385
( knocking on door )

37:11.597 --> 37:14.700
Daniel, this is Celia,
your daughter.

37:14.733 --> 37:17.002
And you're all she
has in the world.

37:18.670 --> 37:22.308
You take the fall for Melinda,
and you go to jail.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.711
And she's all alone.

37:27.546 --> 37:30.382
Can I hold her?

37:33.084 --> 37:34.953
There you go, honey.

37:34.986 --> 37:36.655
( baby quietly fussing )

37:36.688 --> 37:38.924
There you go, sweetie.

37:38.957 --> 37:41.527
( baby fussing quietly )

37:49.835 --> 37:51.337
You said it was urgent.

37:51.337 --> 37:52.338
Is Daniel okay?

37:52.338 --> 37:53.605
He's fine. We're
releasing him.

37:53.639 --> 37:54.440
Thank God.

37:54.473 --> 37:56.074
I-I knew
he couldn't have done this.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.343
Um, I-I've got to go see him.

37:57.343 --> 37:58.744
Well, we still have to clear up

37:58.777 --> 38:00.946
a-a few things.

38:00.979 --> 38:03.349
Why did you visit Annika?

38:07.919 --> 38:10.021
I fell in love with Daniel
the first moment I saw him,

38:10.055 --> 38:12.524
but I was afraid he still
had feelings for Annika.

38:12.558 --> 38:13.992
So you talked to her
woman to woman.

38:14.025 --> 38:15.361
Yeah.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.528
Yeah?

38:16.562 --> 38:17.696
About a month ago.

38:17.729 --> 38:19.064
And I just

38:19.097 --> 38:22.968
knew that it was Daniel's baby.

38:23.001 --> 38:25.103
She tried to deny it,

38:25.136 --> 38:27.639
but I just knew.

38:27.673 --> 38:30.108
And Annika said that she...

38:30.141 --> 38:31.643
wasn't going to tell him.

38:31.677 --> 38:32.811
But you didn't

38:32.844 --> 38:33.979
believe her. You panicked.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.113
It was all falling apart.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.582
And you thought
of Sam Marlett.

38:36.615 --> 38:38.384
He'd do anything
to help Daniel.

38:38.417 --> 38:39.284
No. It wasn't me.

38:39.385 --> 38:40.819
Couple of calls, a
little bit of money.

38:40.852 --> 38:43.655
All of your problems
just disappear.

38:43.689 --> 38:45.624
You're wrong.
( door opening )

38:47.526 --> 38:49.528
Daniel.

38:49.561 --> 38:51.029
Don't touch me.

38:51.062 --> 38:52.998
You have got to believe me.

38:53.031 --> 38:55.100
I would never, ever hurt Annika.

38:55.133 --> 38:56.768
STABLER:
Jezic told Annika

38:56.802 --> 38:58.069
a woman hired him.
I swear,

38:58.103 --> 38:59.405
it was not me.

38:59.405 --> 39:00.439
BENSON:
Melinda,

39:00.472 --> 39:03.575
nobody knew that Daniel
was the father except you.

39:05.811 --> 39:07.045
Who else knows?

39:07.078 --> 39:08.414
No one.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.148
You're a liar.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.418
BENSON:
Melinda...

39:12.418 --> 39:15.421
you have to tell us.

39:18.457 --> 39:20.459
I can't.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.698
You told your mother.

39:26.732 --> 39:29.635
STABLER:
She knew Marlett
from the mailroom.

39:29.668 --> 39:32.170
She was the one who put that
bank brochure in your house.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.171
BENSON:
You knew.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.806
All along, you knew.

39:34.840 --> 39:35.807
No, I didn't.

39:35.841 --> 39:37.576
You let Annika die.

39:37.609 --> 39:39.611
No. I did not find out
until this afternoon.

39:39.645 --> 39:42.147
I went to our business manager
to get money for your bail.

39:42.180 --> 39:44.450
I didn't have enough cash,
so I asked him

39:44.483 --> 39:45.350
about your Cayman account,

39:45.451 --> 39:47.453
and he said
that you didn't have one.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.187
Only Mom does.
Why didn't you say anything?

39:49.220 --> 39:52.123
Because it was too late
to help Annika.

39:52.157 --> 39:54.493
And you were going to let
your mother get away with it.

39:58.196 --> 40:00.466
She's my mother.

40:02.033 --> 40:04.470
I love her.
I didn't know what to do.

40:15.046 --> 40:16.615
Daniel!

40:16.648 --> 40:18.116
My attorney said
you've been released.

40:18.149 --> 40:19.150
What wonderful news.

40:19.184 --> 40:21.186
How could you do this?

40:21.219 --> 40:23.955
I don't understand.

40:23.989 --> 40:24.956
I know I'm not the man

40:24.990 --> 40:27.158
you would have chosen
to marry your daughter.

40:27.192 --> 40:28.527
No education.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.028
No money.

40:30.061 --> 40:32.063
No future.

40:33.064 --> 40:35.133
But I would have loved
your daughter.

40:35.166 --> 40:36.802
I would have been good to her.

40:36.835 --> 40:38.136
Where are you going, Daniel?

40:38.169 --> 40:41.006
Mom, they know it was you.

40:41.039 --> 40:42.774
( whispering ):
What did you say to them?

40:42.808 --> 40:45.176
( whispering ):
Why did you do this?

40:45.210 --> 40:46.578
Why?

40:46.612 --> 40:47.946
I had no other choice.

40:47.979 --> 40:49.481
You love Daniel.

40:49.515 --> 40:52.518
You deserve a wonderful life
together.

40:52.551 --> 40:54.219
That baby would have
ruined everything.

40:54.252 --> 40:56.187
I told you,
that didn't matter to me.

40:56.221 --> 40:57.623
Oh.

40:57.656 --> 41:01.693
You've always been so trusting,
but I know men.

41:01.727 --> 41:03.762
Daniel would have
taken your money,

41:03.795 --> 41:07.032
and gone back to that
woman and her baby.

41:07.065 --> 41:08.199
No.
I did this

41:08.233 --> 41:09.167
for you.

41:09.200 --> 41:10.536
I wanted you to be happy.

41:10.569 --> 41:11.703
That's all
I ever wanted...

41:11.737 --> 41:13.238
Rose Granville,
you are under arrest

41:13.271 --> 41:15.541
for kidnapping and the murder
of Annika Bergeron.

41:15.574 --> 41:16.875
You have the right
to remain silent.

41:16.908 --> 41:18.143
Anything you say can and will

41:18.176 --> 41:19.878
be used against you
in a court of law...

41:19.911 --> 41:21.780
Daniel, wait.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.549
Daniel...
