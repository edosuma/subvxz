00:25.761 --> 00:27.886
My partner sold my out.
-I'm sorry.

They got you cold, man.

00:33.604 --> 00:35.136
Pulled out of jail
in the middle of the night.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.682
Dragged in the middle of nowhere.

00:37.722 --> 00:39.182
You're going to admit to killing

00:39.260 --> 00:40.286
Alberto Garza.

00:40.356 --> 00:42.399
You are about to discover...
-Rita.

00:42.537 --> 00:43.820
the worst is yet to come

00:45.526 --> 00:47.085
And when i finally think it's over...

00:48.032 --> 00:49.423
it all happens again.

00:50.858 --> 00:53.887
i wake up
and it the same damn day.

00:54.075 --> 00:56.137
I don't understand how or why.

00:56.527 --> 00:59.409
All i know is that i have to keep
my girlfriend safe.

00:59.882 --> 01:02.231
She think we going to her mom.
-You're so sweet.

01:15.208 --> 01:16.732
You're so sweet.

01:16.742 --> 01:19.278
I've wanted you to meet
my mom for so long.

01:19.669 --> 01:21.432
What made you
want to do it today ?

01:22.515 --> 01:25.122
I just thought
we should... get away.

01:26.523 --> 01:27.326
Well,

01:27.468 --> 01:29.122
you made my day.

01:33.443 --> 01:36.419
I know things have been
a little bumpy with us lately.

01:39.456 --> 01:40.486
Brett ?

01:43.498 --> 01:45.139
I'm sorry.
What'd you say ?

01:56.985 --> 01:59.264
What's going on ?
What are they doing ?

02:06.333 --> 02:07.346
Brett ?

02:07.600 --> 02:09.841
I know. Hang on.

02:12.075 --> 02:13.552
Get down.

02:16.099 --> 02:17.371
Get down !

02:42.060 --> 02:43.688
What the hell was that ?

02:46.033 --> 02:47.618
Oh, my god, your shoulder.

02:47.623 --> 02:49.001
You've been shot.

02:53.734 --> 02:55.302
Who are those guys ?

03:06.017 --> 03:07.423
What are you doing ?

03:59.389 --> 04:02.165
We're way past
framing him now, sir.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.388
So ?

04:05.873 --> 04:08.218
- Change of plans.
- No more snatch and grab ?

04:09.141 --> 04:11.563
Guy wanted for killing
an assistant D.A.

04:11.578 --> 04:14.258
runs off with his girl.
How's that make him look ?

04:14.820 --> 04:15.833
Desperate.

04:16.019 --> 04:17.271
Guilty as sin.

04:17.918 --> 04:19.637
You know, desperate people,

04:19.732 --> 04:21.481
capable of anything,

04:21.524 --> 04:24.301
even murder.
Murder-suicide...

04:24.784 --> 04:26.111
my specialty.

04:26.336 --> 04:28.279
You ever wonder
why they picked him ?

04:29.875 --> 04:31.427
If I were you...

04:31.566 --> 04:33.315
I wouldn't ask.

04:38.183 --> 04:39.749
I don't understand.
Who were those guys ?

04:39.763 --> 04:41.888
- What did they want from us ?
- I don't know.

04:41.903 --> 04:43.827
- Brett, we need to get you to a hospital.
- No.

04:44.483 --> 04:46.577
No hospitals, no cops.

04:47.668 --> 04:48.448
Hey.

04:49.241 --> 04:51.959
- But those guys just tried to kill us.
- And we need to get as far away

04:51.972 --> 04:53.763
from here as possible.

04:55.606 --> 04:57.798
- Well, you're a cop. Call for backup.
- I can't do that.

04:57.803 --> 04:59.093
- Why ?
- Because the last time

04:59.107 --> 05:01.666
I was in the system,
I got snatched out of county jail

05:01.680 --> 05:03.891
- and ended up...
- What are you talking about ?

05:08.669 --> 05:10.851
I can't tell you.
It won't make any sense.

05:14.531 --> 05:16.837
- You are bleeding out.
- Rita, please !

05:18.844 --> 05:20.703
We're gonna find a store,
you're gonna get supplies

05:20.715 --> 05:22.217
and you're gonna patch me up.

05:25.998 --> 05:27.107
Please.

05:35.055 --> 05:36.209
Okay,

05:36.617 --> 05:37.868
stay calm.

05:38.064 --> 05:39.480
You can do this, all right,

05:39.495 --> 05:41.185
just go in there,
get what you need.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.344
And I promise you,
I will explain everything.

05:43.406 --> 05:45.857
Everything to you as soon
as I get you someplace safe.

05:49.439 --> 05:50.413
Okay ?

06:15.399 --> 06:17.350
- Hello.
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>

06:17.665 --> 06:20.268
- Hopper, I can't talk right now.
- Just listen. I'm being framed

06:20.282 --> 06:22.052
for Garza's murder.

06:22.057 --> 06:23.584
- What ?
<i>- Two detectives,</i>

06:23.752 --> 06:25.802
Spivak and Choi,
are gonna try and flip you

06:25.807 --> 06:26.797
<i>against me,</i>

06:26.814 --> 06:29.684
<i>all right ? They're gonna promise
to get internal affairs off your back.</i>

06:29.701 --> 06:30.817
<i>Don't believe them.</i>

06:30.870 --> 06:32.698
All right, Andrea ? Please.

06:32.855 --> 06:34.156
We're partners.

06:35.973 --> 06:38.950
I'm sorry. I can't do this right now.
I'm heading into I.A.

06:40.125 --> 06:42.785
- I'll call you later.
<i>- Wait, wait, wait. Andrea... Andrea ?</i>

06:44.661 --> 06:45.738
Andrea ?

06:46.110 --> 06:47.342
Andrea !

06:56.410 --> 06:57.852
Excuse me, ma'am.

06:57.856 --> 07:00.125
- Yes, officer ?
- Is everything all right ?

07:03.131 --> 07:06.147
Oh... oh, my Godness.
Right.

07:07.123 --> 07:09.178
I'm an E.R. Nurse, and there was...

07:15.914 --> 07:17.166
A dog ?

07:18.228 --> 07:19.643
So what'd you do with it ?

07:19.894 --> 07:21.377
- Did you put it in your car ?
- No.

07:21.392 --> 07:24.253
I didn't want to move him.
He's back up on the highway.

07:29.477 --> 07:32.195
I'll call animal control. They normally
hand these types of matters.

07:32.211 --> 07:34.688
- No, that's okay. I can do it.
- Get on the ground !

07:35.999 --> 07:37.404
Get  down on the ground.

07:38.586 --> 07:39.754
Come on.

07:45.119 --> 07:46.841
I had it.
Five more seconds,

07:46.855 --> 07:48.999
- and we would've been out of here.
- He was a county sheriff, Rita.

07:49.011 --> 07:51.682
Do you know what he sees on these roads ?
And with all that blood on you,

07:51.688 --> 07:53.986
- there was no way, he was gonna let you go.
- You were scared I was gonna tell him

07:53.990 --> 07:56.058
- what really happened, is that it ?
- No. No. I'm just trying

07:56.071 --> 07:57.957
to get you out of trouble.

08:04.761 --> 08:07.058
Look, I don't... I don't know
what's going on,

08:07.071 --> 08:08.831
but if we are gonna get through
whatever is happening here,

08:08.846 --> 08:11.602
- you are gonna have to trust me.
- This isn't about trust.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.414
It's about keeping us alive.

08:14.640 --> 08:15.540
+

08:21.285 --> 08:23.437
- Where have you been ?
- I had to hide the the truck.

08:23.807 --> 08:25.737
Once you patch me up,
we can get outta here.

08:25.752 --> 08:27.090
And go where ?

08:28.485 --> 08:30.410
I'm gonna ask you again.
Who were those men on the road,

08:30.425 --> 08:31.731
and why aren't we calling
the cops ?

08:31.757 --> 08:33.304
It's complicated.

08:33.369 --> 08:34.465
Try me.

08:41.806 --> 08:43.345
All right, short version.

08:43.389 --> 08:45.015
I've been set up for murder.

08:45.614 --> 08:47.200
An assistant D.A.
was killed last night,

08:47.208 --> 08:49.725
and I think some cops
are trying to frame me for it.

08:52.290 --> 08:53.351
Sit down.

08:59.369 --> 09:02.231
Okay, we need to sterilize it.
This is gonna hurt.

09:02.397 --> 09:03.936
More than getting shot ?

09:11.827 --> 09:13.478
The bullet's still in there.
You need a surgeon.

09:13.495 --> 09:16.049
- No, you're gonna have to do it yourself.
- Brett, I can't.

09:16.063 --> 09:17.497
Yeah, you can.
You've seen it done.

09:17.514 --> 09:18.676
Yeah, at a hospital.

09:18.691 --> 09:21.544
But look where we are. I don't have
the tools to extract a bullet.

09:24.323 --> 09:25.794
All right. Now you do.

09:31.264 --> 09:33.542
Year in vice,
Year in the hate crime unit.

09:33.558 --> 09:35.814
Last 2 years, narcotics
working a 3-man buy team ?

09:35.963 --> 09:37.093
That's right.

09:37.124 --> 09:38.769
Rough trade, narcotics.

09:38.802 --> 09:41.600
I mean, with all the scum you gotta
deal with junkies, crack whores...

09:41.614 --> 09:42.864
it would make me sick.

09:42.879 --> 09:45.337
I don't know. I've found
there's scum in every line of work.

09:45.355 --> 09:47.179
Yeah, but the trick is
you can't let it get you dirty,

09:47.184 --> 09:50.182
'cause that's what brings you into
our lovin'arms here in internal affairs.

09:51.963 --> 09:53.777
You worried about
what I got in here ?

09:53.820 --> 09:55.063
Why would I be ?

09:55.460 --> 09:57.894
Because it's gonna cost you
your career.

09:59.865 --> 10:01.363
We've been watching you...

10:01.521 --> 10:02.757
for weeks.

10:05.207 --> 10:06.340
w hat ?

10:25.932 --> 10:28.821
Your lucky day, Battle. Couple of guys
from robbery homicide wanna talk to you.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.356
Spivak and Choi.

10:30.551 --> 10:32.014
It's about Hopper.

10:34.131 --> 10:36.580
Hey, it's definily not fun
being under the I.A. Microscope.

10:36.593 --> 10:38.430
- We've all been there.
- Yeah, those guys think,

10:38.436 --> 10:40.561
hey, I pulled all this crap
when I was on the streets, so...

10:40.998 --> 10:42.709
they must be doing it, too.

10:43.232 --> 10:44.703
Wait a minute.

10:45.044 --> 10:48.060
You gotta watch that Shelton
in particular. He's a real crusader.

10:49.975 --> 10:51.360
Nutty bar ?

10:51.778 --> 10:52.528
No.

11:07.822 --> 11:10.223
Have to say right out front,
I think you guys are both wrong

11:10.239 --> 11:11.691
about Hopper.

11:11.735 --> 11:14.250
Well, we respect your loyalty,
but we got him cold.

11:14.456 --> 11:16.187
Gun, prints.

11:16.237 --> 11:18.823
Wait, you've got Hopper's prints
on the murder weapon ?

11:18.875 --> 11:20.358
It's a done deal.

11:20.698 --> 11:22.766
D.A.'S office is going
to miss Garza.

11:22.957 --> 11:25.156
Guy never shied away
from the tough ones.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.047
One to the head,
two the chest.

11:30.071 --> 11:32.511
- Execution style.
- Cop style...

11:33.341 --> 11:34.987
just like they teach you
at the academy.

11:35.001 --> 11:37.891
We want you to listen to something,
maybe shed some light on it for us.

11:39.029 --> 11:41.116
<i>Hopper, you should've
received a package today.</i>

11:41.118 --> 11:42.123
<i>It's important.</i>

11:42.134 --> 11:44.605
<i>Don't let anyone know you have it.
You'll be contacted soon.</i>

11:44.610 --> 11:45.880
Who is that ?

11:46.999 --> 11:48.988
What package is she talking about ?

11:49.731 --> 11:51.012
I don't know.

11:52.447 --> 11:54.501
Think it has something to do
with Garza's murder ?

11:57.894 --> 12:00.947
You know homicide always supersedes
internal investigations.

12:01.451 --> 12:03.354
You cooperate with us here,

12:03.694 --> 12:06.607
we'll make this whole Chad Shelton I.A.
thing go away.

12:09.535 --> 12:11.898
When was the last time
you spoke to Hopper ?

12:16.065 --> 12:17.224
Yesterday.

12:18.587 --> 12:20.962
Okay... here we go.
Hold on to something.

12:29.388 --> 12:31.166
I'm sorry.
It's lodged deep in there.

12:31.181 --> 12:33.430
It didn't hit a major artery.

12:36.236 --> 12:38.100
I know there's a lot
you're not telling me.

12:38.612 --> 12:41.092
And although I should be used to it
because I know that's your deal,

12:41.109 --> 12:42.923
it just sucks at a time like this.

12:42.939 --> 12:44.729
Could we not do this
right now, please ?

12:44.732 --> 12:45.982
We  need help, Brett.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.931
- There's gotta be somebody that you trust.
- Yeah,

12:47.947 --> 12:50.299
- you.
- What about Andrea ?

12:50.593 --> 12:52.772
- She's not part of this ?
- I don't know.

12:53.384 --> 12:55.381
Anybody's capable of anything.

12:57.969 --> 12:59.869
Did you get it ?
Did you get it ?

12:59.887 --> 13:02.815
Sorry. We're gonna have
to try it again.

13:07.674 --> 13:10.515
You wanted to know who Andrea Battle
was talking to before she came in.

13:11.039 --> 13:13.469
Let me guess.
Her sleazy little friend Slim.

13:13.869 --> 13:14.610
No.

13:15.565 --> 13:18.273
It's a cell phone registered
to a Rita Shelton.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.804
I'm sure it's not your ex.

13:26.183 --> 13:27.701
I want to believe everything
you're telling me, Brett,

13:27.718 --> 13:29.756
but there's something
I don't understand.

13:29.758 --> 13:32.075
If this Garza guy
was murdered last night

13:32.082 --> 13:34.445
and this investigation
took place overnight,

13:34.457 --> 13:36.045
how could you know about it ?

13:36.558 --> 13:38.263
You were with me
the whole time.

13:48.125 --> 13:50.257
Okay, this is gonna sound like
it's impossible.

13:51.835 --> 13:53.789
But I need you to believe me.

13:54.590 --> 13:56.982
These past three days,
I've woken up...

13:58.358 --> 13:59.858
and it's the same day.

14:00.698 --> 14:02.774
It's the same time,
it's the same place,

14:03.047 --> 14:05.374
it's the same damn
traffic report.

14:05.598 --> 14:08.192
I am living today

14:08.369 --> 14:10.158
over and over again.

14:14.327 --> 14:16.412
- What are you talking about ?
- There's this guy...

14:16.877 --> 14:18.617
there's this guy
in a rock quarry,

14:18.632 --> 14:20.084
and he knows everything

14:20.108 --> 14:22.808
about you, me,
Jen and the kids.

14:23.265 --> 14:26.137
And he wants me
to confess to killing Garza.

14:26.429 --> 14:27.758
All right, and those guys...

14:27.782 --> 14:29.904
those guys on the road...
they work for him,

14:29.918 --> 14:31.374
and they caught me,

14:31.387 --> 14:34.241
and... and they stuck me
with this big-ass needle twice.

14:34.704 --> 14:36.352
And... and...

14:36.363 --> 14:37.683
and ever since...

14:43.750 --> 14:46.640
Andrea took that call not ten minutes
before you swiped her away from me.

14:46.685 --> 14:48.797
So detective Battle talked
to your ex-wife. Big deal.

14:48.804 --> 14:50.735
No, not my ex-wife.

14:50.740 --> 14:52.424
My ex-wife's boyfriend.

14:54.768 --> 14:56.251
I think you're in shock.

14:56.276 --> 14:57.891
I think you've lost...

14:58.556 --> 15:00.287
- a lot of blood.
- I'm not in shock.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.888
This is
really happening to me.

15:02.901 --> 15:04.411
Okay ? I can prove it.

15:04.926 --> 15:06.962
There's a truck accident.
Today.

15:06.969 --> 15:08.411
Spilled baby diapers.

15:08.427 --> 15:09.819
And... and the papers,

15:09.834 --> 15:11.095
all right ?
Check the papers.

15:11.101 --> 15:12.821
The headlines
are all about Garza.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.176
Oh, the Dodgers !

15:14.188 --> 15:15.921
The Dodgers.
The Dodgers win today.

15:15.933 --> 15:17.235
Okay ?
It's the same game.

15:17.239 --> 15:19.143
It's the same day.

15:20.204 --> 15:22.183
So what you're saying is
that we've... we've been

15:22.196 --> 15:24.074
- at this motel before.
- Yes. No.

15:24.088 --> 15:25.481
But you've been shot before.

15:25.496 --> 15:27.314
No.  But they've...
they've come after me.

15:27.318 --> 15:29.194
Have we had
this conversation before ?

15:29.207 --> 15:31.928
- I don't... I don't understand.
- I don't understand either...

15:35.047 --> 15:36.731
the day is the same,

15:37.121 --> 15:37.911
all right ?

15:37.936 --> 15:39.620
But different things

15:39.623 --> 15:40.835
happen,

15:40.841 --> 15:42.734
okay ? It depends.
Like...

15:43.806 --> 15:45.334
this lady at the coffee shop,

15:45.337 --> 15:46.812
one day I save her,

15:46.826 --> 15:49.429
next day...
she gets hit by a bus

15:49.576 --> 15:51.099
because I wasn't there.

15:53.463 --> 15:54.456
You don't see ?

15:56.396 --> 15:57.495
You don't see.

16:04.674 --> 16:05.773
Yeah.

16:05.785 --> 16:07.055
Hopper, where are you ?

16:07.780 --> 16:08.992
Andrea...

16:09.009 --> 16:10.354
they came to you, didn't they ?

16:10.361 --> 16:12.445
Spivak and Choi.
Just like I said they would ?

16:12.451 --> 16:14.326
Look, Hopper, I want to help you.
But I can't

16:14.330 --> 16:16.041
unless you tell me where you are.

16:18.464 --> 16:20.002
You have to trust me.

16:20.115 --> 16:22.620
You cut a deal with I.A.
to bring me in, yes or no ?

16:22.636 --> 16:24.405
I'm not proud of it, okay ?

16:24.745 --> 16:26.287
I'm sorry, Andrea.
I can't.

16:29.492 --> 16:30.927
So he is with her.

16:34.078 --> 16:35.731
You got a fix
on that phone ?

16:36.660 --> 16:37.380
+

16:47.570 --> 16:49.089
I've been thinking.

16:49.136 --> 16:51.222
You said something about needles.

16:51.794 --> 16:54.301
What if someone had given you
an hallucinogen ?

16:55.504 --> 16:57.399
- So none of this is happening ?
- No,

16:57.431 --> 17:00.207
no. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying
how could this have happened last night

17:00.224 --> 17:01.859
if you were with me the whole time ?

17:01.872 --> 17:03.986
It had to have happened
yesterday or

17:04.001 --> 17:06.356
- a few days ago.
- It was yesterday.

17:06.397 --> 17:08.188
Yesterday was today.

17:08.191 --> 17:09.656
Yesterday is...

17:09.891 --> 17:11.199
today.

17:12.510 --> 17:15.085
Have you been having headaches ?
Because maybe...

17:15.290 --> 17:16.617
you've hit your head.
Or maybe...

17:16.631 --> 17:19.170
Don't you think I've been through
this like, a million times,

17:19.469 --> 17:21.019
looked  for explanations ?

17:21.026 --> 17:22.295
Maybe I need an M.R.I.

17:22.299 --> 17:23.397
Maybe I need a shrink.

17:23.411 --> 17:25.661
Maybe I stepped on
a damn time machine.

17:25.856 --> 17:27.099
I don't know !

17:36.725 --> 17:37.639
Okay.

17:39.007 --> 17:40.413
I don't understand

17:41.309 --> 17:43.010
how this is happening to me.

17:44.072 --> 17:45.745
I don't know who's doing it.

17:46.179 --> 17:48.238
I don't know how to make it stop.
I don't know why.

17:48.251 --> 17:50.291
And right now,
I don't care.

17:50.716 --> 17:52.774
The only thing I care
about right now

17:53.163 --> 17:55.477
is making sure that you're...

18:01.312 --> 18:02.287
What ?

18:02.742 --> 18:03.804
What is it ?

18:07.805 --> 18:10.343
You keep saying this is
about keeping me safe.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.671
If you're saying you've lived
this day before,

18:14.098 --> 18:15.646
what happens to me, Brett ?

18:15.660 --> 18:16.508
Nothing.

18:16.524 --> 18:17.755
Nothing.

18:18.106 --> 18:20.308
We're fine.
We're together.

18:21.644 --> 18:22.869
You're lying.

18:22.884 --> 18:25.248
Those guys that ambushed us
on the road...

18:26.114 --> 18:28.057
you think
something happens to me.

18:36.413 --> 18:38.068
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

18:40.107 --> 18:42.009
Nothing is going to happen to you.

18:44.202 --> 18:46.921
All we have to do is make sure
we don't get caught.

19:13.127 --> 19:14.897
Great.
We'll be there in 20.

19:16.712 --> 19:18.549
Local county sheriffs
are good for backup.

19:18.556 --> 19:20.422
They'll meet us there,
secure the roads,

19:20.433 --> 19:22.157
hang back till we say go.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.677
I still think
we should've brought S.W.A.T.

19:29.899 --> 19:31.728
you're doing the right thing,
you know ?

19:39.826 --> 19:42.515
<i>and the final score
is in, just moments ago,</i>

19:42.523 --> 19:46.102
<i>the Dodgers capped an amazing 7-run
rally in the ninth inning</i>

19:46.116 --> 19:48.423
<i>to beat the Giants.
Highlights coming up in sports.</i>

19:48.439 --> 19:50.631
<i>We're also gonna take
a look at...</i>

19:55.499 --> 19:56.680
I'm sorry...

19:57.934 --> 19:59.462
about your dress.

20:01.097 --> 20:02.332
It's okay.

20:04.226 --> 20:06.588
I could have sold that cop
back at the store.

20:09.248 --> 20:11.414
I did try to save
a stray once.

20:11.935 --> 20:15.096
He was hit on the highway...
this poor, scruffy mutt, bleeding.

20:16.444 --> 20:19.248
I was with Chad
on our way to vegas

20:19.320 --> 20:21.204
for our honeymoon.

20:21.794 --> 20:22.845
anyway,

20:23.250 --> 20:25.002
I had him pull over.
I could...

20:25.082 --> 20:27.611
tell he was all broken inside.

20:28.872 --> 20:30.614
Chad didn't want him in the car.

20:31.950 --> 20:33.990
And he said we should just leave him,

20:34.971 --> 20:36.558
let him die naturally.

20:39.191 --> 20:40.338
So we did.

20:48.590 --> 20:51.672
I've washed blood off
my hands before, but

20:52.196 --> 20:53.705
but never yours.

20:55.506 --> 20:56.946
Get in the bathroom.

21:11.060 --> 21:12.542
She's inside.

21:13.255 --> 21:14.372
How'd you find me ?

21:14.389 --> 21:16.512
Give me some credit.
I'm a cop.

21:17.791 --> 21:19.246
What's wrong with your shoulder ?

21:19.740 --> 21:21.039
He was shot.

21:21.218 --> 21:22.448
-  Rita, you okay ?

21:22.452 --> 21:23.868
Yeah, it's him
I'm worried about.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.125
Did you come alone ?

21:27.268 --> 21:28.566
Yeah, of course.

21:33.176 --> 21:35.752
Look, I know the trouble
you're in, Hopper.

21:36.946 --> 21:38.166
And I want to help.

21:38.240 --> 21:40.189
But you have to be straight with me.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.366
Tell me what happened
with Garza.

21:43.314 --> 21:45.025
Nothing happened with Garza.

21:45.558 --> 21:46.848
I don't know the guy.

21:46.861 --> 21:48.792
You know me better
than that, Andrea.

21:49.277 --> 21:51.544
Then that's what you tell'em
when you turn yourself in.

21:51.626 --> 21:52.647
<i>Forget about it.</i>

21:53.008 --> 21:54.345
<i>I'm not going to jail.</i>

21:54.599 --> 21:56.475
I didn't kill Garza.

21:57.342 --> 21:58.691
So what are you gonna do ?

22:00.202 --> 22:01.627
Whatever it takes.

22:02.313 --> 22:04.082
Okay, Hopper, just calm down.

22:04.353 --> 22:05.952
All right ?
We can fix this.

22:06.088 --> 22:08.579
Just don't do anything drastic.

22:14.146 --> 22:17.018
She's got two more minutes to make
something happen, then we're going in.

22:25.520 --> 22:26.809
Who are these guys ?

22:26.824 --> 22:28.631
How did they get past
the checkpoint ?

22:31.149 --> 22:32.938
I said no cars in or out
until we're clear.

22:32.942 --> 22:35.107
Call your men and make sure
they secure the road.

22:47.198 --> 22:48.737
Something's not right.

22:58.001 --> 22:59.609
Get the vests.

23:06.180 --> 23:06.900
+

23:13.379 --> 23:14.765
What's wrong ?

23:22.910 --> 23:24.123
They found us.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.589
Hopper.
We're clear.

24:15.333 --> 24:16.400
New plan.

24:29.565 --> 24:30.959
Put the weapon down.

24:58.508 --> 25:00.461
You guys make a run for the car.
I'll cover you.

25:00.474 --> 25:02.558
- We can't leave you here.
- I've got back up. You don't.

25:02.572 --> 25:04.987
- Andrea, I'm not gonna let you do that.
- Just shut up and listen.

25:05.002 --> 25:06.828
They've got a gun with
your prints on it.

25:07.571 --> 25:09.006
They played me some voice mail.

25:09.277 --> 25:11.585
A woman talking about some package
they sent to you.

25:11.589 --> 25:13.003
They think it has something
to do with Garza.

25:13.010 --> 25:14.789
<i>Hopper, you should've
received a package today.</i>

25:14.803 --> 25:15.872
<i>It's important.</i>

25:20.747 --> 25:22.183
On three.
You ready ?

25:26.100 --> 25:27.045
One...

25:29.486 --> 25:30.381
two...

25:31.020 --> 25:31.917
go !

25:43.862 --> 25:44.881
Hopper !

25:52.894 --> 25:53.611
Go.

26:35.216 --> 26:37.446
You were gonna meet my mom today.

26:43.850 --> 26:44.650
<i>... the Dodgers</i>

26:54.667 --> 26:56.176
It's gonna be okay.

26:57.314 --> 26:58.893
Just gotta keep going.

27:36.825 --> 27:38.222
It's gonna be all right.

27:39.177 --> 27:40.493
Just gotta keep going.

27:42.265 --> 27:43.718
It's gonna be a new day.

27:44.316 --> 27:45.453
It's gonna be a new day.

27:45.459 --> 27:46.633
a new day... a new day

27:46.636 --> 27:49.116
I just gotta keep going.
I just gotta keep going.

28:30.983 --> 28:32.349
Oh, Brett.

28:33.993 --> 28:35.600
Oh, my God.

28:42.060 --> 28:43.050
+

28:52.737 --> 28:54.385
<i>Dr. Artlet, I.C.U.</i>

28:55.540 --> 28:57.379
<i>Dr. Miller, 5-7-2-3.</i>

28:58.407 --> 28:59.275
Jen.

29:00.390 --> 29:01.568
Brett, it's okay.

29:02.242 --> 29:03.398
Where's Rita ?

29:03.980 --> 29:05.144
Where's Rita ?
Is she okay ?

29:05.157 --> 29:07.831
Yeah. She's just talking
to the doctors.

29:07.834 --> 29:08.864
- Lie back.
- Okay.

29:08.868 --> 29:10.947
- Take it easy.
- Okay.

29:11.546 --> 29:12.594
Okay.

29:16.093 --> 29:17.351
Hopper !

29:17.560 --> 29:18.780
Andrea got shot.

29:19.795 --> 29:20.950
Slow down.

29:20.965 --> 29:23.088
You lost a lot of blood
last night.

29:23.103 --> 29:24.852
What happened to you ?
They're saying it's a bullet wound.

29:24.857 --> 29:26.673
We got ambushed by these guys,

29:26.700 --> 29:29.118
and... Rita didn't tell you ?
She was there.

29:29.423 --> 29:30.173
We...

29:35.895 --> 29:38.488
Don't worry. Your sister
and the kids are okay.

29:38.493 --> 29:40.043
Jen, come on.
You gotta get outta here, all right ?

29:40.069 --> 29:41.837
It's not safe.
It's not safe. Go.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.419
- Relax. It's okay.
- Go.

29:43.432 --> 29:45.166
You are all right, okay ?

29:45.168 --> 29:46.392
You're all right.

29:47.242 --> 29:49.520
Relax.
It's just a mild sedative.

29:49.534 --> 29:51.513
We'd like you to sleep on it.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.498
- No, no needles.
- It's just a sedative.

29:53.515 --> 29:54.487
No. No !

29:54.510 --> 29:56.022
No, relax. It's okay.

29:56.034 --> 29:57.824
- You are all right.
- This is impossible.

29:57.828 --> 29:59.618
They never gave me the shot.

29:59.622 --> 30:00.662
I never...

30:00.765 --> 30:02.322
they never caught us.

30:02.741 --> 30:04.088
Detective Brett Hopper.

30:05.081 --> 30:07.845
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto garza.

30:07.859 --> 30:09.361
No, no. You two, out.

30:09.377 --> 30:10.321
Now.

30:13.279 --> 30:15.164
Well, since you asked so nicely.

30:22.697 --> 30:24.187
We'll have an officer
on the door.

30:24.194 --> 30:25.820
Yeah, I'm sure you will.

30:29.265 --> 30:30.364
I'll be back.

30:34.111 --> 30:36.177
I told you two he wasn't
ready to be moved.

30:36.181 --> 30:37.894
He seems fine to us.
We're lining up an ambulance

30:37.908 --> 30:39.781
- to transport him.
- until you get one, he's under our care.

30:39.788 --> 30:42.210
How can you treat one of your
own like he's some common criminal ?

30:42.212 --> 30:44.108
- Our father was a cop.
- Ladies, please.

30:44.112 --> 30:46.036
We're just trying to do our jobs.

30:46.703 --> 30:49.556
Ms. Shelton, I understand you were with
detective Hopper last night. Is that correct ?

30:49.570 --> 30:50.292
Yes, I was.

30:50.309 --> 30:52.651
So you can provide him with
an alibi for the entire night ?

30:52.665 --> 30:53.527
Absolutely.

30:54.094 --> 30:55.980
So how did he get
that bullet wound ?

31:01.145 --> 31:03.509
Yeah, I thought so. Let's get an E.T.A.
on that ambulance.

31:03.525 --> 31:05.322
We should talk
to his partner, Battle.

31:09.592 --> 31:11.007
you worried about
what's in here ?

31:11.165 --> 31:12.199
Why would I be ?

31:12.770 --> 31:14.651
'Cause it's gonna
cost you your career.

31:17.333 --> 31:18.746
We've been watching you...

31:20.116 --> 31:21.586
for weeks.

31:22.226 --> 31:23.246
Danny Yan.

31:23.355 --> 31:25.297
The guys at vice call him "Slim."

31:25.474 --> 31:27.783
Runs a gentlemen's club
over in chinatown.

31:27.797 --> 31:29.555
You been doing a lot
of business with him.

31:29.732 --> 31:31.531
He's a confidential informant.

31:31.548 --> 31:33.477
He a drug dealer,
human garbage.

31:33.485 --> 31:36.002
Who helps us bring down
bigger pieces of garbage.

31:36.024 --> 31:36.902
Really ?

31:37.607 --> 31:40.568
Where exactly are these heavy hitters ?
They're not on your list of recent arrests.

31:40.579 --> 31:43.145
Not every tip leads to
a colombian cartel.

31:45.115 --> 31:47.316
Well, tell me, how exactly
are you paying Mr. Yan

31:47.321 --> 31:48.880
for these juicy little nuggets,

31:48.896 --> 31:51.558
'cause there's no official list
of any C.I. Payouts to him

31:51.560 --> 31:53.138
in the last couple of months ?

31:54.927 --> 31:56.420
I haven't filed them yet.

32:11.348 --> 32:13.222
I find it interesting
that before every meeting

32:13.235 --> 32:16.193
with this confidential informant,
you make a withdrawal...

32:16.813 --> 32:18.428
from your personal account.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.960
$1,000 here,
$2,000 there.

32:21.914 --> 32:23.848
Tell me something,
you seen Eddie lately ?

32:26.643 --> 32:27.509
What ?

33:08.353 --> 33:09.125
What ?

33:09.570 --> 33:10.974
Hopper's been shot.

33:11.217 --> 33:12.593
He's at the hospital.

33:12.803 --> 33:15.454
They're saying he killed Garza,
took a bullet in the process.

33:20.761 --> 33:22.503
- You think Hopper...
- No.

33:24.846 --> 33:25.841
You ?

33:27.033 --> 33:29.060
Anybody's capable of anything.

33:31.004 --> 33:32.735
I need to know what happened to you.

33:32.767 --> 33:35.035
We went to bed last night and
everything was fine. And then I wake up,

33:35.040 --> 33:38.097
and you're soaking in a pool of blood
with a gaping hole in your shoulder.

33:38.514 --> 33:41.001
I mean, my God, Brett,
it looked like somebody butchered you.

33:43.625 --> 33:44.926
It's complicated.

33:46.569 --> 33:47.551
Try me.

33:47.979 --> 33:50.764
I thought I knew how
to fix this day, but I can't.

33:50.894 --> 33:52.674
It's bigger than I thought.

33:53.569 --> 33:55.014
I don't understand.

33:55.929 --> 33:59.193
All you need to know is that
I am being framed for murder,

33:59.697 --> 34:01.178
and I need your help.

34:02.278 --> 34:03.414
You gotta trust me.

34:03.439 --> 34:05.679
This isn't about trust.
This is life and death.

34:05.683 --> 34:06.926
I almost lost you today.

34:06.940 --> 34:09.139
Do you have any idea
how that feels ?

34:14.141 --> 34:16.726
Do you believe me when
I say that I did not do this ?

34:17.833 --> 34:18.693
Yes.

34:19.571 --> 34:20.583
Well, help me.

34:23.358 --> 34:25.704
Help me get outta here so
I can figure out who did.

34:27.243 --> 34:28.607
I'm sorry, honey.

34:29.130 --> 34:31.409
Maybe you could just whip up
some pasta for the kids tonight

34:31.414 --> 34:32.993
or take them out.

34:33.330 --> 34:34.697
Randall, don't get angry.

34:34.702 --> 34:37.000
It's my brother. He's in bad shape.
They're saying that....

34:37.016 --> 34:38.688
- Clear the way !
- ... he can't even be moved.

34:38.692 --> 34:39.732
Code blue.

34:47.025 --> 34:48.587
- Why aren't you in there ?
- He was crashing.

34:48.589 --> 34:50.869
Nurses kicked me out
when the alarms went off.

34:57.162 --> 34:58.712
Son of a bitch !

34:59.832 --> 35:00.560
+

35:02.089 --> 35:03.315
How many men do we have ?

35:03.318 --> 35:05.146
<i>Three units on site,
four more on the way.</i>

35:05.149 --> 35:07.330
If his girlfriend's with him,
I'm bringing her in, too.

35:07.345 --> 35:09.757
- I'll take the back.
- I'll meet security in the lobby.

35:16.245 --> 35:17.813
<i>We have units
on the front and rear.</i>

35:17.827 --> 35:20.795
No, I said every exit.
He does not leave this hospital.

35:28.665 --> 35:30.051
You dropped this.

35:33.133 --> 35:34.615
I gotta be better about that.

35:34.623 --> 35:36.497
- You know this woman ?
- Not exactly.

35:45.536 --> 35:46.834
I need your keys.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.671
Up you go. Come on.

35:52.681 --> 35:54.680
You can't run forever, Hopper.

35:54.800 --> 35:56.415
I don't plan to.

35:56.592 --> 35:58.594
Then why make it hard ?
Turn yourself in.

35:58.721 --> 36:00.166
To you guys ?

36:00.178 --> 36:02.639
For all I know, you planted that gun
in my closet.

36:04.582 --> 36:07.127
Who said anything about
a gun in your closet ?

36:11.162 --> 36:12.631
Come on. Let's go.

36:19.581 --> 36:21.035
Go, go, go, go.

36:25.114 --> 36:27.460
As soon as they find Choi,
they're gonna change frequencies,

36:27.465 --> 36:30.539
but until then, we can listen in.

36:32.530 --> 36:33.713
What is that ?

36:33.728 --> 36:36.705
Well, let's hope Choi records
all of his case notes,

36:36.719 --> 36:38.909
like a good little homicide detective.

36:39.874 --> 36:42.046
<i>Need to find this Damien,
see where he fits.</i>

36:42.051 --> 36:44.051
<i>Next message tied to him
or Garza ?</i>

36:44.862 --> 36:47.246
<i>Hopper, you should've received
a package today.</i>

36:47.327 --> 36:48.683
They played me some voice mail

36:48.926 --> 36:51.205
A woman talking about some
package they sent to you.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.209
They think it has something
to do with Garza.

36:53.376 --> 36:54.861
I gotta go to my place.

37:04.031 --> 37:07.002
What if we just drive...
right now ?

37:07.350 --> 37:09.128
What if we just run ?

37:09.529 --> 37:11.575
We can't.
Won't solve anything.

37:13.279 --> 37:15.000
You woke up in a pool
of blood this morning,

37:15.004 --> 37:17.079
and you can't tell me how
and you can't tell me why.

37:17.479 --> 37:19.478
I'm just... I'm just trying to understand
what we're doing.

37:19.482 --> 37:21.110
I gotta find out who killed Garza

37:21.123 --> 37:23.084
and why they're framing me for it.

37:23.797 --> 37:25.913
And the first step to finding
some of those answers

37:25.926 --> 37:28.216
might be right there
in that mailbox.

37:28.231 --> 37:29.377
What do you plan to do ?

37:29.390 --> 37:31.822
I'm gonna stake my place out,
make sure that cop's alone,

37:32.354 --> 37:34.046
then I'll figure something out.

37:41.465 --> 37:43.628
So this is what it's like.

37:44.429 --> 37:45.928
this is what what's like ?

37:45.941 --> 37:47.570
A stakeout.

37:48.588 --> 37:50.531
You've been on stakeouts
with me before.

37:50.536 --> 37:51.731
What ? When ?

37:51.743 --> 37:53.506
Koko's manchurian barbecue.

37:53.509 --> 37:56.150
Koko's ? No.
That was our first date.

37:57.816 --> 38:00.210
- That was a stakeout ?
- Wait, no. I...

38:00.522 --> 38:01.570
Wait.

38:02.890 --> 38:03.845
Okay.

38:03.867 --> 38:05.088
I had no choice.

38:05.103 --> 38:08.465
We were both doing that
"are we more than friends" thing, and

38:08.481 --> 38:11.295
and I... I wanted to be,
but I knew that if

38:11.310 --> 38:14.076
I canceled on you again,
then you'd... that I'd lose you.

38:14.092 --> 38:15.267
So...

38:17.168 --> 38:19.101
Yeah, you probably would have.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.104
Right.

38:28.324 --> 38:30.342
I can get the cop away
from the building.

38:59.272 --> 39:00.925
- what'd you do ?
- You don't wanna know.

39:00.940 --> 39:03.390
- You get the package ?
- No. The cops must have taken my mail.

39:03.405 --> 39:05.921
- I'll get here earlier tomorrow.
- Tomorrow ?

39:07.739 --> 39:09.088
What do you mean ?

39:12.314 --> 39:13.567
- Hello.
<i>- Rita, are you nuts ?</i>

39:13.571 --> 39:15.686
<i>- You're aiding and abetting a fugitive.</i>
- Who is it ?

39:15.691 --> 39:17.477
- Chad.
<i>- Rita. Rita !</i>

39:17.493 --> 39:19.338
- What are you doing ?
- He's in a room full of cops

39:19.354 --> 39:22.208
tracking your phone.
Come on. We gotta go.

39:22.402 --> 39:23.502
<i>Rita.</i>

39:24.915 --> 39:25.908
<i>Rita ?</i>

39:26.450 --> 39:27.384
<i>Rita.</i>

39:28.636 --> 39:29.582
Rita !

39:31.503 --> 39:32.354
Hey.

39:33.958 --> 39:35.183
What's going on ?

39:35.627 --> 39:37.387
Yeah, hey, man.
How's it going ?

39:37.413 --> 39:40.218
Ah, you know,
same old, same old.
