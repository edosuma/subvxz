00:00.967 --> 00:03.633
[announcer] Previously on
Ink Master...

00:03.700 --> 00:05.833
Ten of the best tattoo artists
on the planet...

00:05.900 --> 00:07.267
Welcome to New York City.

00:07.333 --> 00:09.633
[announcer] ...are competing
to determine who's number one...

00:11.267 --> 00:12.367
[groans]

00:12.433 --> 00:13.967
[announcer]
...tattooing human canvases

00:14.033 --> 00:16.233
in a series
of extreme challenges

00:16.300 --> 00:19.300
designed to test
every essential discipline.

00:19.367 --> 00:20.633
These are your clients.

00:24.167 --> 00:26.033
[announcer] The artists'
raw talent

00:26.100 --> 00:28.200
was immediately put to the test
in the flash challenge.

00:28.267 --> 00:31.400
You're here to win $100,000.
Go hard or go home.

00:35.133 --> 00:36.667
[announcer]
In the elimination tattoo...

00:36.733 --> 00:38.067
[bleep]

00:38.133 --> 00:40.133
...pain proved to be too much
for Jeremy's canvas.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.600
[crying] No, I can't, I can't!

00:41.667 --> 00:43.200
it sucks that I got stuck
with this girl

00:43.267 --> 00:44.100
for my first client.

00:44.167 --> 00:45.733
[bleep]

00:45.800 --> 00:47.100
[Al] What the hell happened?

00:47.167 --> 00:48.433
What, you got
a jackhammer in there?

00:48.500 --> 00:50.267
If he can't get it right,
that's on him.

00:50.333 --> 00:52.800
One less person for me
to have to worry about.

00:52.867 --> 00:55.133
[announcer] Judged by top names
in the industry

00:55.200 --> 00:57.000
Oliver Peck and Chris Nunez,

00:57.067 --> 00:59.233
at the elimination,
B-Tat and Jeremy

00:59.300 --> 01:00.500
were the bottom two.

01:00.567 --> 01:02.933
Jeremy, as soon as she
showed signs of discomfort,

01:03.000 --> 01:06.633
you should have taken her out
of that uncomfortable position.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.367
[Chris] B-Tat, you're bumped.
You're not straight.

01:09.433 --> 01:10.967
And you put your balls
on the table,

01:11.033 --> 01:12.667
and I feel like
you hacked 'em off.

01:12.733 --> 01:15.367
B-Tat, you don't have
what it takes

01:15.433 --> 01:16.933
to be Ink Master.

01:18.367 --> 01:20.033
[announcer] Nine artists remain,

01:20.100 --> 01:23.200
but only one will earn
$100,000 prize

01:23.267 --> 01:26.067
and the title of Ink Master.

01:26.133 --> 01:29.133
[theme music playing]

02:11.500 --> 02:14.333
How would any of y'all feel
if y'all went home

02:14.400 --> 02:16.100
on the fact
that he never finished his?

02:16.167 --> 02:18.533
[Al Fliction] Jeremy's back.
He didn't finish.

02:18.600 --> 02:19.567
It was gonna be

02:19.633 --> 02:21.100
a horrible tattoo
when it was done.

02:21.167 --> 02:22.967
Yeah, we're never gonna know

02:23.033 --> 02:24.400
what his tattoo
was gonna look like.

02:24.467 --> 02:26.633
He could've finished it and
it could've looked [bleep] up!

02:26.700 --> 02:29.067
[Jeremy] Al's walking in
and just instigating trouble.

02:29.133 --> 02:30.000
This is not cool.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.967
If I went home, and he stayed,

02:33.033 --> 02:34.900
I'd be feeling
[bleep] up right now.

02:34.967 --> 02:36.000
The outline looks good.

02:36.067 --> 02:37.700
If she wouldn't have been
so crazy,

02:37.767 --> 02:39.367
it would have been
a lot cleaner.

02:39.433 --> 02:41.667
The threat of going home
really terrifies me.

02:41.733 --> 02:43.633
There's 100 grand
on the line here.

02:43.700 --> 02:45.933
I'm really ready to just get
into the next challenge.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.533
I want to know
what I have to do

02:47.600 --> 02:49.800
so that I can show
that I'm a good artist.

03:07.600 --> 03:08.967
Good morning, everybody.

03:09.033 --> 03:11.133
You're all one step closer
to that 100 grand,

03:11.200 --> 03:13.667
a write-up in Ink Magazine,
and most importantly,

03:13.733 --> 03:15.300
the title of Ink Master.

03:17.033 --> 03:19.733
As always, we begin
with the Flash Challenge,

03:19.800 --> 03:21.767
a quick skill test
that'll give the winner

03:21.833 --> 03:25.133
first pick of the human canvas
for the elimination tattoo.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.800
This week,
we're testing an ability

03:26.867 --> 03:28.167
that can make
or break a tattoo...

03:28.233 --> 03:29.300
Lines.

03:29.367 --> 03:31.733
Lines are the heart
of every great tattoo.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.700
[Al Fliction] Lines are very
important to tattoos.

03:33.767 --> 03:35.233
It's the foundation
of the tattoo.

03:35.300 --> 03:36.633
If you got shaky lines,

03:36.700 --> 03:37.867
the tattoo's never
gonna look sharp,

03:37.933 --> 03:39.533
they're never gonna look clean.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.900
Today, these are
your canvases.

03:48.233 --> 03:50.300
Tattoo and car design
have a lot in common.

03:50.367 --> 03:52.867
Just as you use lines
to accent your designs,

03:52.933 --> 03:55.600
car manufacturers
do the same.

03:55.667 --> 03:57.800
Your job is to highlight
your car with lines

03:57.867 --> 04:00.167
to bring out the personality
of the car.

04:00.233 --> 04:01.733
[Shane] A good tattooer
should be able to do

04:01.800 --> 04:03.700
crisp, solid line work.

04:03.767 --> 04:06.333
The thinner the line, the more
it shows your shakiness.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.967
Also, the bolder the line...
Like, it takes skill

04:09.033 --> 04:10.300
to put in
a bold straight line.

04:10.367 --> 04:12.367
Like, good points and curves
and everything like that.

04:12.433 --> 04:15.767
Today you're gonna be judged
by Oliver Peck, Chris Nunez.

04:15.833 --> 04:17.632
And we also have
a very special guest judge.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.933
When he's not
in the tattoo shop,

04:20.000 --> 04:21.200
you can find him
on Auction Hunters...

04:21.267 --> 04:22.633
Ton Jones.

04:22.700 --> 04:24.200
[applause]

04:26.533 --> 04:27.967
I've been
in the tattoo industry

04:28.033 --> 04:29.667
since I was 14 -years-old.

04:29.733 --> 04:31.367
-What's happening, bro?
-How are ya?

04:31.433 --> 04:32.867
-How you doing?
-Very, very good.

04:32.933 --> 04:36.033
I've done everything
from help build tattoo machines

04:36.100 --> 04:38.467
to Learning the old-school ways
of blending ink.

04:40.033 --> 04:42.367
As you can see,
Ton is heavily tattooed.

04:42.433 --> 04:44.967
Show 'em that head.
look at these lines.

04:45.033 --> 04:46.433
You wouldn't want to
[bleep] up this guy, right?

04:46.500 --> 04:48.700
You're lucky you're only doing
cars today.

04:48.767 --> 04:50.500
Speaking of those cars,
you guys are gonna be

04:50.567 --> 04:51.767
drawing keys
for your car.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.933
Josh, you're first
to draw a key.

04:54.000 --> 04:54.867
Come on up.

04:55.900 --> 04:57.267
Number eight. Bili.

04:58.133 --> 04:59.633
Number two. Tommy.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.833
Number one. Al.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.800
That's number six. James.

05:04.967 --> 05:05.967
Number five...

05:06.033 --> 05:09.000
Man, I pulled the lemon brick.

05:09.067 --> 05:10.367
Lord, have mercy.

05:10.433 --> 05:13.200
Lea. Number three.

05:13.267 --> 05:14.100
Heather.

05:15.367 --> 05:16.767
Number four.

05:16.833 --> 05:19.967
Shane. Number nine.

05:20.033 --> 05:21.900
Number seven for Jeremy.

05:21.967 --> 05:24.700
Alright, guys, you've got
90 minutes to do this.

05:24.767 --> 05:25.967
Clock starts now.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.867
[Al Fliction] It's gonna
be called the Chevy Fliction.

05:31.933 --> 05:32.967
I love painting on cars.

05:33.033 --> 05:36.067
I do flame jobs
on my own cars.

05:36.133 --> 05:38.933
The artistic side of you
should kick in

05:39.000 --> 05:40.867
and let you know
what kind of design

05:40.933 --> 05:43.533
to design for that car
that would go with it.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.467
When you're designing
in the tattoo world,

05:45.533 --> 05:47.133
you kind of look
at the client,

05:47.200 --> 05:48.800
and you design something
to flow

05:48.867 --> 05:50.367
with the flow
of their body

05:50.433 --> 05:51.367
the same way you can design

05:51.433 --> 05:52.900
a design to flow
with these cars.

05:52.967 --> 05:55.300
This is going home
with me.

05:55.367 --> 05:56.933
When you want lines
on a car,

05:57.000 --> 05:59.200
you want something the flows
with the body work.

05:59.267 --> 06:00.800
something that flows
with the sheet metal.

06:00.867 --> 06:03.933
Everything has to be a blend
of speed and aerodynamics

06:04.000 --> 06:05.933
that goes along
with highlighting the features

06:06.000 --> 06:08.333
that are naturally there.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.933
Uh, I'm still figuring out.
I didn't do nothing yet.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.400
[Lea] I've got a cool
green Camaro.

06:14.467 --> 06:16.433
I could totally see myself
driving it.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.133
but I have no idea
what kind of lines

06:18.200 --> 06:19.733
I'm gonna do on that car.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.367
Uh...[bleep].

06:23.267 --> 06:24.900
[Jeremy] I do
new-school tattoos.

06:24.967 --> 06:27.767
I like to use a really thick,
bold outline

06:27.833 --> 06:28.833
on all of my stuff.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.833
But I got this lowrider

06:30.900 --> 06:33.233
that does not fit my style
whatsoever.

06:33.300 --> 06:35.067
The trunk kind of
comes up to a point

06:35.133 --> 06:36.233
right in the middle,

06:36.300 --> 06:38.233
So I want to build off
of that point.

06:38.300 --> 06:40.400
The first week here has been
a little bit intense.

06:40.467 --> 06:42.267
I really hope that
I get a chance

06:42.333 --> 06:43.133
to show what I can do.

06:46.700 --> 06:47.633
How's it going, hillbilly?

06:47.700 --> 06:49.167
I'm trying
to figure my lines out.

06:49.233 --> 06:50.967
[Oliver] Got a little sweat
on that brow, bud.

06:51.033 --> 06:52.700
ooh, you know,
it's hot out here.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.167
I don't know how
I'm gonna accentuate a line

06:56.233 --> 06:57.733
on a square box
that I got.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.200
[bleep] hard as hell
to get that [bleep] straight

07:11.267 --> 07:12.233
all the way around.

07:13.333 --> 07:14.433
[Bili] I know I could win.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.900
I know that there's
a lot of great artists

07:15.967 --> 07:18.333
and a lot of great competition,
so it's gonna be a fight.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.800
Al's painting the whole car.
I don't know what he's doing.

07:20.867 --> 07:22.967
Some of the other artists are
just working in smaller areas.

07:23.033 --> 07:26.200
Like Shane, he's just focused
to one part on the car.

07:26.267 --> 07:27.967
I'm trying to go
for symmetry, but...

07:29.333 --> 07:31.333
It's [bleep] tough, dude.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.733
This is an exercise
in trying to get the artist

07:33.800 --> 07:35.267
to use the contours
of the shape

07:35.333 --> 07:37.133
that they're working on
to accentuate it.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.833
And that's basically
what we do

07:38.900 --> 07:40.167
as tattooers every day.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.367
I guess I'll put
something else on it.

07:43.433 --> 07:44.867
[Josh] I'm not into cars
whatsoever.

07:44.933 --> 07:47.067
I'm kind of sweating it

07:47.133 --> 07:49.000
on where I'm going
with the entire thing.

07:49.067 --> 07:51.633
[laughs] Good thing
I'm not a painter.

07:51.700 --> 07:54.033
Forty-five minutes left, guys.
halfway down.

08:01.433 --> 08:04.433
That's right,
I'm starting over.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.300
[Heather] I started on the rear
quarter panel,

08:06.367 --> 08:07.967
and I realized it was
too difficult to paint

08:08.033 --> 08:09.200
from that angle.

08:09.267 --> 08:11.500
So I decided to go
to the hood of the car.

08:11.567 --> 08:13.300
This [bleep] is hard
as [bleep].

08:20.800 --> 08:22.300
[Bili] Damn!

08:22.367 --> 08:23.967
-[bleep] dope, dude.
-Thanks.

08:24.033 --> 08:25.500
This is fun as hell, man.

08:25.567 --> 08:27.533
Getting into the pinstriping
on this car is exciting

08:27.600 --> 08:29.833
because it really goes along
with tattooing,

08:29.900 --> 08:33.033
because you're working so much
with the lines of a body.

08:33.100 --> 08:35.100
[Jeremy] If I can just focus
on making sure

08:35.167 --> 08:36.567
that my lines are smooth,

08:36.633 --> 08:38.600
then I think I have
a good shot at winning.

08:38.667 --> 08:40.767
Okay, guys,
five more minutes.

08:41.633 --> 08:42.433
[bleep] me!

08:45.000 --> 08:47.800
I think I'm gonna quit
while I'm behind.

08:47.867 --> 08:50.533
This [bleep] is hard
to do.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.200
Heather does quite a bit
of complaining.

08:52.267 --> 08:53.867
Like, I don't know
what the [bleep] the problem is.

08:54.667 --> 08:55.500
[sighs]

08:57.967 --> 09:00.400
[Dave] Five, four, three,

09:01.167 --> 09:03.300
two, one.

09:03.367 --> 09:05.200
Okay, guys, that's time.

09:06.767 --> 09:07.667
Brushes down.

09:08.333 --> 09:10.900
[sighs] God.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.233
Alright, guys,
Tommy had car number one.

09:14.833 --> 09:16.600
You did go a little overboard
with the business [bleep].

09:16.667 --> 09:18.000
If you had more time,
you could have actually

09:18.067 --> 09:19.567
spread that out
and done a lot more.

09:21.367 --> 09:23.167
-Bili.
-I tried to do something

09:23.233 --> 09:24.533
that I could keep
really symmetric

09:24.600 --> 09:26.567
and kind of go with, like,
the motion of the car.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.133
I really like
the minimalistic.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.467
Keeping to simple,
clean, straight lines,

09:30.533 --> 09:32.100
using the body line
on the side of the car.

09:32.167 --> 09:34.100
You were able to spend
all the time you had

09:34.167 --> 09:34.967
on making 'em really clean.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.200
Hey, Lea.

09:37.267 --> 09:38.867
I didn't really know
what to do

09:38.933 --> 09:40.267
with this car.

09:40.333 --> 09:42.633
[Oliver] This challenge
is to design lines

09:42.700 --> 09:44.200
that fit the body shape
of the car.

09:44.267 --> 09:46.133
You have not done that.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.400
The car does have
a natural shape to it,

09:48.467 --> 09:50.967
and these just look placed
along the side

09:51.033 --> 09:52.067
of the flat side
of the car.

09:54.233 --> 09:57.167
-[Dave] Heather.
-I know my piece is small,

09:57.233 --> 09:59.967
but I was trying to go
with the flow of the car.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.367
I don't see... where.

10:02.433 --> 10:05.033
I spent an hour on that back,
and I erased it.

10:05.100 --> 10:06.167
That might have been
your doom.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.300
[Dave] James.

10:09.367 --> 10:10.767
[Ton] The centerpiece
is awesome.

10:10.833 --> 10:12.667
That's a nice piece
of artwork.

10:12.733 --> 10:14.033
What you did over here...

10:14.100 --> 10:15.633
is a train wreck.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.800
You took a nice piece of artwork
you had going

10:17.867 --> 10:19.900
and totally
screwed yourself up.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.600
In this case,
less would have been more.

10:21.667 --> 10:23.600
If you threw a little piece
on top of the scoop,

10:23.667 --> 10:26.333
left the rest of it alone,
you'd have been in the money.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.167
[James] I kind of dropped
the ball on this one.

10:28.233 --> 10:30.333
It kind of upsets me,
'cause that's what I love,

10:30.400 --> 10:31.767
and that's my passion,
is cars.

10:31.833 --> 10:34.233
I just kind of feel
a little upset about it.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.833
Al.

10:36.900 --> 10:38.300
I just wanted
to kind of match

10:38.367 --> 10:41.333
the racing stripes on it
the best I could.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.267
[Oliver] The line quality,
from a distance,

10:43.333 --> 10:44.767
it looks like
it goes with the car.

10:44.833 --> 10:46.233
I think it's good.

10:46.300 --> 10:47.767
[Al] I'm not threatened
by anybody.

10:47.833 --> 10:49.600
I want to prove to the rest
of my competition

10:49.667 --> 10:51.800
that I'm one to reckon with.

10:51.867 --> 10:53.100
-What's up, guys?
-Jeremy.

10:53.167 --> 10:55.033
I found this little piece here
that was already done,

10:55.100 --> 10:56.400
and a big open spot
on the trunk.

10:56.467 --> 10:58.733
So I figured go for

10:58.800 --> 11:00.567
a little bit of a mirrored
kind of look.

11:00.633 --> 11:01.833
[Chris] This is
a line competition.

11:01.900 --> 11:03.400
Your lines are shaky.

11:03.467 --> 11:05.967
It just looks like you were
real nervous doing it.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.567
Your lines look nervous.

11:07.633 --> 11:08.867
I definitely wish
I would have

11:08.933 --> 11:10.767
pulled out a little bit more
for the Flash Challenge.

11:10.833 --> 11:13.433
There's so much pressure.

11:13.500 --> 11:16.333
-[Dave] What's happening, Josh?
-Wow.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.933
Some of your design
counteracts

11:19.000 --> 11:20.833
the direction of the flow
of this vehicle.

11:20.900 --> 11:22.800
It kind of looks like
some of this stuff

11:22.867 --> 11:25.233
should be just turned around
and going the other way,

11:25.300 --> 11:26.600
because it's kind of
coming backwards

11:26.667 --> 11:27.967
towards the front
of the car.

11:28.033 --> 11:30.400
I feel like I took
the toughest car

11:30.467 --> 11:32.100
and made it look like
a pussy.

11:32.167 --> 11:33.767
-[Dave] What's up, Shane?
-Hey, man.

11:33.833 --> 11:34.767
You went a little overkill.

11:34.833 --> 11:36.933
You put too much
in one spot.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.333
At this point,
less would have been more.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.700
Alright, so it seems like
some of these guys

11:43.767 --> 11:46.167
went really, really,
deeply wrong,

11:46.233 --> 11:48.300
and some of 'em got it
kind of right.

11:48.367 --> 11:52.000
You know, we definitely saw
some talent shine in Bili.

11:52.067 --> 11:53.733
He's got the longest, cleanest,
straightest lines

11:53.800 --> 11:55.100
in the bunch right here.

11:55.167 --> 11:56.367
He really shows off
the skill that he would have

11:56.433 --> 11:57.467
lining a tattoo.

11:57.533 --> 11:59.233
Those who actually
attempted the flames...

12:00.433 --> 12:02.233
Out of all of 'em,
only one prevailed.

12:02.300 --> 12:03.933
[Oliver] Al's, man.
Al's looks great.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.767
And he did use
the negative space

12:05.833 --> 12:07.867
as a whole 'nother line
in his design.

12:07.933 --> 12:09.100
The girls, actually, I think,

12:09.167 --> 12:11.500
kind of just
[bleep] the bed.

12:11.567 --> 12:14.400
After seeing what Jeremy did
on the Cadillac...

12:14.467 --> 12:16.267
It's like, okay, the first time,

12:16.333 --> 12:17.467
the girl was shaking
and crying...

12:17.533 --> 12:20.000
[crying] No, I can't! I can't!
I can't!

12:20.067 --> 12:22.033
...the second time,
the car was just sitting there,

12:22.100 --> 12:24.067
and it still didn't
look finished.

12:24.133 --> 12:26.100
-Well, what do you think?
-I think we got a decision.

12:26.167 --> 12:27.067
Yeah.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.633
You get 90 minutes
to finish this challenge.

12:31.700 --> 12:34.200
There's $100,000
on the line here,

12:34.267 --> 12:36.700
so it's really time
to step it up.

12:36.767 --> 12:38.433
Some of the line work
was outstanding.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.000
Other people looked like
they went at it

12:40.067 --> 12:41.700
with a sharpie
and an energy drink.

12:41.767 --> 12:44.000
Those that are trying
to get the easy way out,

12:44.067 --> 12:46.067
get off your ass
and do something about it.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.500
[Oliver] Heather,
we really expected

12:47.567 --> 12:48.533
to see more from you for this.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.000
Well, as I already stated,
Oliver,

12:51.067 --> 12:52.700
is that I already had
to start over.

12:52.767 --> 12:54.333
Your quality of design
on there,

12:54.400 --> 12:55.800
none of it fit the car.

12:55.867 --> 12:57.400
And that's
the challenge here

12:57.467 --> 12:58.833
is to make lines
fit a shape.

12:58.900 --> 13:00.233
I thought the challenge was
just to make nice lines

13:00.300 --> 13:02.100
on the car.

13:02.167 --> 13:05.100
This challenge is to bring out
the personality of this car...

13:05.167 --> 13:06.133
I thought it was about
line work.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.267
...and do lines
that fit the shape.

13:07.333 --> 13:08.267
Well, I don't
really know cars.--

13:08.333 --> 13:10.600
Lines that fit
the goddamn shape!

13:12.400 --> 13:13.200
What do you want?

13:14.300 --> 13:15.500
You want me to [bleep] judge

13:15.567 --> 13:16.767
from this little [bleep]
you did?

13:16.833 --> 13:17.967
[man] Holy [bleep].

13:19.800 --> 13:21.033
[Al] Heather's crying already.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.733
If you don't want to do it,
hey, there's the door.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.267
[Dave] The clock starts now.

13:25.333 --> 13:26.700
[Jeremy] Can you get EMT?

13:32.500 --> 13:36.467
This challenge is to bring out
the personality of this car,

13:36.533 --> 13:37.933
and to do lines
that fit the shape.

13:38.000 --> 13:38.933
Well, I don't
really know cars--

13:39.000 --> 13:41.100
Lines that fit
the goddamn shape!

13:44.867 --> 13:46.900
There's $100,000
on the line here,

13:46.967 --> 13:48.700
so it's really time
to step it up.

13:51.433 --> 13:53.200
That being said, there was
some really, really nice work

13:53.267 --> 13:54.333
that happened here.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.367
Bili, we liked what you did
with the car.

13:56.433 --> 13:59.233
You brought it to life
simplistically.

13:59.300 --> 14:02.000
You did what it took
to make it stand out.

14:02.067 --> 14:03.867
Al, good line weight.

14:03.933 --> 14:05.500
Good line distance
between the line

14:05.567 --> 14:07.833
and the inner line.

14:07.900 --> 14:09.800
The judges have made
their decision.

14:11.367 --> 14:12.633
And today's winner...

14:18.867 --> 14:19.900
is Bili.

14:19.967 --> 14:22.067
[applause]

14:23.400 --> 14:24.700
Thank you.

14:24.767 --> 14:26.100
You get first pick
of the next human canvas

14:26.167 --> 14:27.600
in the elimination tattoo.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.000
I feel I should have won
that challenge

14:30.067 --> 14:31.700
on being, just, creative.

14:31.767 --> 14:34.167
But they gave it to Bili.
The guy's two feet tall.

14:34.233 --> 14:36.033
all he did was
put the paintbrush in his mouth

14:36.100 --> 14:37.933
and run on the side of the car
and got a straight line.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.400
It's time to go back

14:39.467 --> 14:41.000
and get ready
to meet your new canvases.

14:46.833 --> 14:49.433
I'm just pissed because
it seems like every time,

14:49.500 --> 14:50.567
those guys just rip me up.

14:50.633 --> 14:52.533
I have thick skin,

14:52.600 --> 14:54.567
but just the pressure
and the lack of sleep...

14:54.633 --> 14:56.867
I'm kind of cracking.
[chuckles]

14:56.933 --> 14:59.000
I think Heather's
just not prepared

14:59.067 --> 15:00.533
to deal with
all these challenges.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.733
I definitely feel like
she's losing hope.

15:07.333 --> 15:09.000
I just don't work well
under pressure. You know?

15:09.067 --> 15:10.867
Everybody's different.
You guys...

15:10.933 --> 15:13.267
Maybe some of you are better
under pressure. I'm not.

15:13.333 --> 15:15.733
Seriously, Heather, did you
think you were coming here

15:15.800 --> 15:17.967
and not gonna be thrown into
some weird challenges?

15:18.033 --> 15:19.933
it's not gonna be easy. Period.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.567
I'm, like, next on their list,
that's for sure.

15:21.633 --> 15:23.867
-Ever since the meat locker--
-Then step your [bleep] up...

15:23.933 --> 15:25.567
Yeah, get your [bleep]
together, man.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.567
Come on, you can't say that.
You just gotta do it.

15:27.633 --> 15:28.867
[Al] Heather's crying already.

15:28.933 --> 15:30.967
If you don't want to do it,
hey, there's the door.

15:38.767 --> 15:40.367
What's up, guys?

15:40.433 --> 15:42.167
You all got your own
custom shop here,

15:42.233 --> 15:43.867
and obviously, the goal here
is to outlast

15:43.933 --> 15:45.600
everybody else
in the competition.

15:45.667 --> 15:47.700
You're playing
for $100,000.

15:49.233 --> 15:50.533
In this week's
Elimination Tattoo,

15:50.600 --> 15:51.667
you'll be inking a style

15:51.733 --> 15:53.933
that many cultures
consider sacred.

15:54.000 --> 15:54.800
Tribal.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.233
The definition
of a clean tribal tattoo

15:59.300 --> 16:01.567
would have to be
clean lines,

16:01.633 --> 16:04.333
saturated large area
of black.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.900
Throughout history,
the tribal tattoo

16:05.967 --> 16:07.533
has been very important.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.500
They were used to identify
the enemy in war,

16:09.567 --> 16:11.267
as symbols of marriage,

16:11.333 --> 16:13.700
and to establish a status
within the tribe.

16:13.767 --> 16:15.533
You'll be creating a tattoo
that incorporates

16:15.600 --> 16:16.900
your own personal style

16:16.967 --> 16:18.767
as well as traditional
tribal elements.

16:18.833 --> 16:22.000
Tribal tattoos have a lot of
sharp edges and curves to 'em.

16:22.067 --> 16:23.500
A lot of solid black.

16:23.567 --> 16:26.000
I'm stoked. It's something
that I do a lot of.

16:26.067 --> 16:27.967
The elimination tattoos
will be done

16:28.033 --> 16:30.267
just as all true tattoo art
is done,

16:30.333 --> 16:32.667
and that's on human canvases.

16:32.733 --> 16:33.867
So let's meet 'em.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.200
Bili, because you won
the flash challenge,

16:44.267 --> 16:45.667
you get to inspect these guys.

16:45.733 --> 16:47.033
Pick a canvas.

16:51.567 --> 16:53.933
There's a couple of people
that I immediately picked out

16:54.000 --> 16:55.433
just 'cause it looked like
they had good skin.

16:55.500 --> 16:56.500
Where are you looking
to do it?

16:56.567 --> 16:58.967
Actually, I was thinking
about my head.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.800
That's a hard tattoo to do,

17:04.867 --> 17:07.767
you know, because there's a lot
of coverage on the head.

17:07.833 --> 17:09.867
-Where are you looking to do?
-Tribal cross on the back.

17:11.099 --> 17:12.599
Adinkra symbols,
or West African symbols,

17:12.666 --> 17:15.567
-like, down my back.
-Cool. Right on.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.200
Are you looking
for something symmetric?

17:18.267 --> 17:19.867
Yes.

17:19.933 --> 17:21.032
Let's go with the head.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.599
Clearly, he's trying
to prove a point.

17:26.666 --> 17:28.633
That's a lot to finish
in five hours.

17:28.700 --> 17:31.200
I chose something
that is difficult.

17:31.267 --> 17:32.600
but I'm pretty confident
that I'll be able

17:32.667 --> 17:33.700
to do what he wants.

17:33.767 --> 17:35.967
[Lea] I think Bili's got
some balls.

17:36.033 --> 17:37.400
Good luck, Bili.

17:37.467 --> 17:39.733
The rest of the canvases
are gonna, one-by-one,

17:39.800 --> 17:41.533
pick one of these skulls here,

17:41.600 --> 17:43.667
and each one has your names
underneath it.

17:43.733 --> 17:46.233
Whatever skull they pick up,
that's your client.

17:46.300 --> 17:47.933
Simon, come up
and grab a skull.

17:49.767 --> 17:50.900
Al.

17:52.067 --> 17:53.267
Shane.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.667
My canvas has, like,
nice white skin,

17:55.733 --> 17:57.233
so black's gonna
really look good on him.

17:57.967 --> 17:59.100
Tommy.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.033
Josh.

18:03.100 --> 18:03.900
Lea.

18:05.667 --> 18:06.967
Jeremy.

18:07.033 --> 18:09.100
[Jeremy] I hate that
Tribal is the next challenge.

18:09.167 --> 18:10.800
I haven't done tribal
in years.

18:10.867 --> 18:12.033
I don't like doing tribal.

18:13.500 --> 18:14.300
Heather.

18:15.667 --> 18:16.533
James.

18:18.667 --> 18:20.200
You have the rest
of the afternoon to talk

18:20.267 --> 18:23.000
with your human canvases
and come up with a design.

18:23.067 --> 18:25.333
Tomorrow you'll have five hours
to do this tattoo.

18:26.667 --> 18:28.967
And based on your work,
one of you

18:29.033 --> 18:32.133
will be the next to pack up
your machines and go home.

18:33.500 --> 18:34.500
Good luck tomorrow.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.267
The biggest elements
of a tribal tattoo

18:39.333 --> 18:41.933
are lines and shape,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.033
and mostly just solid black.

18:44.100 --> 18:46.500
So this is an excellent chance
for them to be able

18:46.567 --> 18:47.733
to do good, clean lines.

18:48.500 --> 18:49.367
Guess we can

18:49.433 --> 18:50.433
-kick around some ideas.
-Sure.

18:52.033 --> 18:54.067
[Bili] I see you got
some reference here.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.233
If you like that skull,
I could probably do something

18:57.300 --> 18:59.567
where maybe the tribal wraps
toward the back...

18:59.633 --> 19:01.000
-Right.
-...like a cocoon

19:01.067 --> 19:02.833
around something.
Like you're looking in.

19:02.900 --> 19:06.333
Yeah, I wanted to, like,
basically do the whole hairline.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.467
So we could go
as far down as here.

19:08.533 --> 19:09.967
And we are limited
to five hours,

19:10.033 --> 19:14.367
so you know, the whole head
might be rough.

19:14.433 --> 19:15.967
But I mean,
it depends on the design.

19:16.033 --> 19:17.500
Maybe I can come up
with something.

19:17.567 --> 19:19.500
[Bili] My client wants
a whole-head tattoo.

19:19.567 --> 19:21.833
He's really not willing
to do half of it,

19:21.900 --> 19:23.667
nor do I really want
to do half of it

19:23.733 --> 19:25.200
because it would be
nearly impossible

19:25.267 --> 19:27.667
to match it
or draw into it again.

19:27.733 --> 19:29.733
So let me see the area
you're talking about and...

19:29.800 --> 19:32.167
I'm talking about...
up here.

19:32.233 --> 19:34.600
What do you got...
What's all the irritation from?

19:34.667 --> 19:36.367
Um, I have psoriasis.

19:36.433 --> 19:38.800
Have you gotten a tattoo
when it's been this flared up?

19:38.867 --> 19:39.867
No. it's usually not.

19:39.933 --> 19:41.333
I'm just concerned, like...

19:41.400 --> 19:43.433
trying to heal it
over the next four, five days

19:43.500 --> 19:44.567
while it's flared up.

19:44.633 --> 19:46.000
I don't know what's gonna happen
when I start

19:46.067 --> 19:47.433
tearing into his skin.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.800
-I'm just against a wall.
-[Dave] How you doing, man?

19:49.867 --> 19:52.733
He's got a little psoriasis here
I'm just concerned about.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.300
With psoriasis, your body's
pushing blood to the surface,

19:55.367 --> 19:57.200
and white blood cells is
trying to heal it.

19:57.267 --> 19:59.767
Medically, it'll take about four
to five times longer to heal,

19:59.833 --> 20:01.467
and you're more susceptible
to infection.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.433
I'm really, sorry, man,
but I don't think

20:03.500 --> 20:05.033
that we can...

20:05.100 --> 20:06.867
-We can do this.
-Okay.

20:06.933 --> 20:08.167
We appreciate
you being here.

20:08.233 --> 20:09.667
No, that's great. I understand.

20:09.733 --> 20:11.400
That leaves you
without a canvas.

20:12.833 --> 20:14.233
Yeah. no backup?

20:16.800 --> 20:18.933
[Shane] I'm one of the good
competitors on this show.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.500
Am I getting screwed,
like, that fast?

20:22.600 --> 20:23.933
[Bili] My client's
in a lot of pain.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.100
He started, like,
losing his eyesight.

20:32.367 --> 20:34.767
That leaves you
without a canvas.

20:35.733 --> 20:37.033
Yeah. no backup?

20:39.033 --> 20:40.233
I don't know.
I mean,

20:40.300 --> 20:41.400
how do you feel about
getting tattooed?

20:45.700 --> 20:47.333
Uh...

20:47.400 --> 20:49.500
-Yeah?
-We could do that.

20:49.567 --> 20:51.033
[Ton] So I'm the victim.

20:51.100 --> 20:52.533
Because it could be unfair
to the game,

20:52.600 --> 20:53.600
I think I'm gonna have
to step back

20:53.667 --> 20:55.300
and let the boys
do the judging.

20:55.367 --> 20:57.800
-How long you been doing this?
-Uh, 14 years.

20:57.867 --> 20:59.433
If he messes me up,

20:59.500 --> 21:01.167
I'm throwing him a beating.

21:11.033 --> 21:12.200
I don't like tribal.

21:12.267 --> 21:14.767
I don't want people
to come get tribal from me.

21:14.833 --> 21:16.133
I don't think that determines

21:16.200 --> 21:17.633
if we're a good tattoo artist
or not.

21:17.700 --> 21:19.167
You could tell
who did a better job.

21:20.533 --> 21:21.567
One of the problems
with Jeremy

21:21.633 --> 21:23.533
is that he only
really does new-school.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.967
So this is completely
out of his element.

21:26.033 --> 21:27.433
He's not used
to drawing tribal.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.567
He's just not experienced enough
to be here.

21:29.633 --> 21:31.933
At least we can prove
that even though it is tribal,

21:32.000 --> 21:33.667
-we can do it solid.
-Mm-hmm.

21:33.733 --> 21:35.200
I've lost clients before

21:35.267 --> 21:37.333
because they don't
see tribal in my book.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.400
-How ya doing?
-How ya doing, man?

21:43.200 --> 21:44.400
[Dave] Morning, everybody.

21:44.467 --> 21:46.100
It's time for all you guys
to get to work

21:46.167 --> 21:47.933
and put your line skills
to the test.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.900
You have five hours
to complete your tattoos.

21:50.967 --> 21:52.067
The clock's
about to start.

21:52.133 --> 21:54.533
Three, two, one...

21:54.600 --> 21:56.533
Get to work.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.400
The actual basics
of a tribal tattoo...

21:59.467 --> 22:01.000
Very solid black,

22:01.067 --> 22:03.200
fill-in,
and incredibly clean lines.

22:03.267 --> 22:06.533
Mostly clean lines
that run parallel to each other.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.267
So everything is almost,
like, perfectly spaced,

22:09.333 --> 22:11.900
geometrically,
or in a flowing manner.

22:11.967 --> 22:15.100
-So you like the design.
-That's killer.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.300
I'm trying
to put behind me

22:16.367 --> 22:19.100
all the frustrations
I've had so far.

22:19.167 --> 22:21.500
That's the jam.
That looks good.

22:21.567 --> 22:22.833
I know exactly
what I'm doing,

22:22.900 --> 22:24.233
I know exactly
how to put in the ink,

22:24.300 --> 22:25.933
I know how to make it stay,

22:26.000 --> 22:27.400
and I know how
to make it solid.

22:27.467 --> 22:29.933
I feel like
I'm in it right now.

22:32.267 --> 22:34.133
-I don't want anything solid.
-Okay.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.033
Because being on the knee,
it's gonna fade out,

22:36.100 --> 22:37.500
and I don't wanna have
to get a touch-up.

22:37.567 --> 22:39.267
Yeah, no problem.

22:39.333 --> 22:41.067
[Shane] We're doing, like,
a tribal skull.

22:41.133 --> 22:43.600
I'd incorporated some light,
fancy line work in there too.

22:49.333 --> 22:52.033
That's a good line.

22:52.100 --> 22:54.533
[Ton] The location I picked
wasn't the brightest on my side.

22:54.600 --> 22:57.200
Last time I got my knee tattooed
was about five years ago.

22:57.267 --> 22:59.233
Long enough to forget
about the pain.

23:05.467 --> 23:08.733
I chose something
that is difficult, but...

23:08.800 --> 23:11.433
I chose it because I wanted
to do something big

23:11.500 --> 23:13.033
that, you know,
I could show off with.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.467
Here we go.

23:14.533 --> 23:16.067
Just let me know
how you're feeling.

23:16.133 --> 23:18.133
Anything, you just
keep me in the know.

23:19.900 --> 23:21.300
[Tommy] I think Bili
is overambitious.

23:21.367 --> 23:23.233
I think he bit off a little more
than he could chew.

23:23.300 --> 23:25.600
He's gonna regret
that [ bleep], man. Definitely.

23:25.667 --> 23:27.367
I mean, it's a race,

23:27.433 --> 23:29.600
but we're moving along steadily.

23:30.400 --> 23:31.800
So it should be alright.

23:31.867 --> 23:33.467
The way I approach tattoos,
you know,

23:33.533 --> 23:35.433
I really obsess over it,
and analyze it,

23:35.500 --> 23:37.733
and try to come up with, like,
just the best possible solution,

23:37.800 --> 23:40.133
both for the client
and for myself.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.233
So let's see.

23:42.100 --> 23:43.100
Awesome.

23:43.167 --> 23:45.033
That's the reason
I'm in the top here.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.333
[Dave] You guys,
that's one hour down.

23:48.400 --> 23:49.467
Four hours to go.

23:51.033 --> 23:53.933
[Al] My client wants
a tribal piece with lion on it.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.367
He went to South Africa
on safari,

23:56.433 --> 23:57.633
got stalked by a lion.

23:57.700 --> 23:58.867
That's crazy.

23:58.933 --> 24:00.067
Would you ever
go back there again?

24:00.133 --> 24:01.500
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

24:01.567 --> 24:03.000
[Al] I enjoy doing tribal.

24:03.067 --> 24:04.267
The other artists
are all crying

24:04.333 --> 24:05.233
'cause that's not
something they do.

24:05.300 --> 24:06.733
That's not their style.

24:06.800 --> 24:08.900
It's something
that I do a lot of.

24:08.967 --> 24:10.700
It's looking
so [bleep] dope, don't it?

24:10.767 --> 24:11.967
[laughs]

24:15.967 --> 24:19.033
How you liking these...
Pulling all these lines?

24:19.100 --> 24:20.867
I hate lines, man.

24:20.933 --> 24:23.300
I could show that I at least
know what I'm doing.

24:23.367 --> 24:27.200
And eventually a new-school
piece will come along,

24:27.267 --> 24:28.900
and somebody'll want
to get a blender tattoo.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.900
[Chris] Jeremy is really great
at doing what he does.

24:31.967 --> 24:35.467
He just is not able to come
outside of his comfort zone.

24:35.533 --> 24:38.000
This sucks. [chuckles]

24:38.067 --> 24:39.633
Two more hours to go, guys!

24:43.500 --> 24:44.900
[Bili] Heads are difficult
to tattoo.

24:44.967 --> 24:46.367
The pain is pretty bad.

24:49.267 --> 24:51.833
You're getting a lot
of sheer force, you know,

24:51.900 --> 24:54.600
just repeatedly
banging on your skull.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.467
I'm seeing stars. [groans]

24:56.533 --> 24:59.367
There's a lot of nerves,
and it's very painful

24:59.433 --> 25:01.200
to try to squeeze
a whole head tattoo

25:01.267 --> 25:03.567
and rush
something like that.

25:03.633 --> 25:05.800
I just don't think
it's a smart idea.

25:05.867 --> 25:07.567
Give me... Uh, give me,
like, two more minutes

25:07.633 --> 25:09.233
-and we'll let you take a break.
-Cool.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.233
-Is that cool? Are you sure?
-Yeah, dude. Yeah.

25:11.300 --> 25:12.267
I just want
to kill this spot

25:12.333 --> 25:13.600
so I don't have
to go back into it.

25:13.667 --> 25:15.467
I definitely have to rush
a little bit,

25:15.533 --> 25:18.167
but the one thing I want to do
is I want to prove people wrong.

25:18.233 --> 25:19.367
I want to be
able to finish.

25:25.200 --> 25:26.467
[bleep].

25:26.533 --> 25:27.867
Outline's done, huh?

25:27.933 --> 25:30.967
Yeah. Do you want me
to shade inside?

25:31.033 --> 25:32.800
So they look like
deeper cavern, like...

25:32.867 --> 25:35.367
Highlight the flames
as the teeth, and the eyes,

25:36.367 --> 25:38.767
then bring in the pentacle.

25:38.833 --> 25:39.967
[Shane] Now I'm worried,

25:40.033 --> 25:42.600
because Ton didn't
want me to do

25:42.667 --> 25:43.667
anything bold in there.

25:43.733 --> 25:44.833
So now I feel like
it's kind of...

25:44.900 --> 25:45.967
It's kind of weak-looking.

25:46.033 --> 25:47.533
If we filled it in,

25:47.600 --> 25:49.233
I think it'd be too much,
don't you?

25:49.300 --> 25:51.167
It probably would overpower
a little bit, yeah.

25:51.233 --> 25:52.400
Yeah.

25:52.467 --> 25:54.767
One hour. One hour left.

26:00.967 --> 26:02.600
[Lea] You alright, dude?

26:02.667 --> 26:04.500
[Lea] My client is not happy.

26:04.567 --> 26:06.733
He's moving
all over the place.

26:06.800 --> 26:09.200
I cannot do
a straight line on him.

26:09.267 --> 26:11.000
[man] You gonna use
every single minute?

26:11.067 --> 26:13.167
-Yeah, I'm gonna have to.
-[sighs]

26:13.233 --> 26:14.933
I think that Lea's tattoo
is poorly composed.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.433
The cross is just
slapped there,

26:16.500 --> 26:18.633
and the tribal
goes from extremely thin

26:18.700 --> 26:19.800
to extremely thick.

26:19.867 --> 26:23.100
My lines on the one side
of the tattoo are good.

26:23.167 --> 26:26.867
On the other side of the tattoo,
they're not the best.

26:26.933 --> 26:28.267
I can see myself

26:28.333 --> 26:29.900
falling off a cliff.

26:30.833 --> 26:32.100
[Dave] Thirty minutes left.

26:34.433 --> 26:35.767
[Bili] My client's
in a lot of pain.

26:35.833 --> 26:38.467
Man... [bleep]

26:38.533 --> 26:40.333
He started, like, losing his
eyesight a little bit,

26:40.400 --> 26:41.933
from, you know,
all the rattling.

26:45.300 --> 26:47.567
-Do you want me to get somebody?
-Mm-hmm.

26:47.633 --> 26:48.533
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

26:50.033 --> 26:52.233
[Bili] At this point,
his body's cutting out.

27:01.733 --> 27:02.800
[Bili] I knew going into this

27:02.867 --> 27:04.200
that I took a piece
that was huge.

27:04.267 --> 27:06.100
I was pretty confident
I could finish it.

27:06.167 --> 27:07.233
I'm not finished.

27:07.300 --> 27:08.433
I need, like,
another 20 minutes.

27:12.033 --> 27:13.633
I don't want
to leave this guy with,

27:13.700 --> 27:15.067
you know,
an unfinished head...

27:15.133 --> 27:17.433
You know, this guy's got to
walk around with it every day.

27:17.500 --> 27:18.867
I'm ruining this guy's life.

27:24.167 --> 27:26.700
This is a really,
really bad tattoo from you.

27:26.767 --> 27:28.400
It's tattoo 101, man.

27:28.467 --> 27:30.433
We need to see
finished tattoos.

27:30.500 --> 27:31.533
Bad choice.

27:34.933 --> 27:37.667
-[Al] How much time?
-[Dave] 30 seconds left.

27:37.733 --> 27:39.200
Al Fliction.

27:39.267 --> 27:40.400
Yeah!

27:40.467 --> 27:43.000
Still got the machine fired up.
So does James.

27:43.067 --> 27:45.567
Looks like you're working
like there's money on the line.

27:45.633 --> 27:46.567
You alright?

27:50.067 --> 27:50.933
[Dave] Ten seconds.

28:00.667 --> 28:03.333
And that's it, guys.
Time's up.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.267
-No more ink.
-Whoo!

28:05.333 --> 28:07.500
I wish I had more time.

28:07.567 --> 28:08.967
[Oliver] Right down to the wire.

28:09.033 --> 28:10.500
Whew...

28:10.567 --> 28:12.733
[Bili] I'm feeling
very disappointed right now.

28:12.800 --> 28:15.100
He's gonna have to walk around
with an unfinished tattoo.

28:15.167 --> 28:17.867
I'm a little worried
going into the elimination.

28:17.933 --> 28:20.000
Not being able to finish
may be a deciding factor.

28:23.667 --> 28:24.600
Bili's nervous.

28:24.667 --> 28:25.767
Of course I'm nervous.

28:25.833 --> 28:27.333
You be mad
if they sent you home?

28:28.300 --> 28:29.333
I'd be upset.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.800
But if they're looking
for quality work,

28:30.867 --> 28:32.500
you know, maybe they'll
look past

28:32.567 --> 28:34.133
the fact that
I didn't finish it.

28:34.200 --> 28:35.667
[Al] But it is
a competition.

28:35.733 --> 28:37.867
Bili got a guy
walking outside

28:37.933 --> 28:39.433
with half his head done.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.700
I mean,
this is Ink Master.

28:40.767 --> 28:42.400
Being that you're
a tattoo artist

28:42.467 --> 28:43.567
for a lot of years,

28:43.633 --> 28:45.500
you should know
your limitations

28:45.567 --> 28:46.767
on what you can do

28:46.833 --> 28:48.367
and what you can't do
in a matter of time.

28:48.433 --> 28:49.433
Everybody here,

28:49.500 --> 28:51.500
they send you home
and they keep Bili,

28:51.567 --> 28:52.633
you're gonna
feel [bleep] up.

28:52.700 --> 28:54.000
[Shane] I won't feel
[bleep] at all, dude.

28:54.067 --> 28:55.333
Because you
finished your piece.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.367
If I was a judge,
I would take what he did,

28:57.433 --> 28:58.800
and judge that.

28:58.867 --> 29:00.367
[Al] He chose
that head piece.

29:00.433 --> 29:02.433
He couldn't finish it,
and he should go home.

29:21.300 --> 29:23.333
Welcome, guys,
to another elimination round.

29:26.133 --> 29:28.067
For this week's
elimination tattoo,

29:28.133 --> 29:30.333
we asked you to create
a tribal tattoo

29:30.400 --> 29:32.967
that incorporates
your own personal style.

29:35.467 --> 29:37.233
Heather, you're up first.

29:40.100 --> 29:41.967
How do you
think you did?

29:42.033 --> 29:43.833
Personally, I feel
that I did a good job.

29:43.900 --> 29:45.133
It fit the leg,

29:45.200 --> 29:47.633
and also we put
a little color in there.

29:47.700 --> 29:49.667
Yesterday
in the Flash Challenge,

29:49.733 --> 29:51.500
things got a little tense.

29:51.567 --> 29:52.567
Well, I don't
really know cars--

29:52.633 --> 29:54.900
Lines that fit
the goddamn shape!

29:54.967 --> 29:56.467
You want me
to [ bleep] judge

29:56.533 --> 29:58.767
from this
little [bleep] you did?

29:58.833 --> 30:01.500
I don't feel
that mine was the worst.

30:01.567 --> 30:03.133
That's my opinion.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.867
We didn't say
it was "the worst,"

30:04.933 --> 30:06.567
we said it was
one of the worst.

30:06.633 --> 30:09.200
No, you picked me out
to be the worst.

30:09.267 --> 30:10.767
Don't you remember
what you said?

30:10.833 --> 30:11.633
[Oliver] Oh, I remember.

30:14.033 --> 30:16.400
But this time,
you really surprised me.

30:16.467 --> 30:17.867
This thing really
came out good.

30:19.100 --> 30:21.800
It's sharp, and precise,

30:21.867 --> 30:24.633
and I really love this design.

30:24.700 --> 30:26.433
[Chris] Heather, you woke up
a little.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.367
You're coming back.

30:31.967 --> 30:32.767
Bili.

30:36.100 --> 30:37.600
What's going on, guys?

30:39.533 --> 30:41.633
-So you chose the head tattoo.
-Yeah, I chose the head.

30:41.700 --> 30:43.333
[Dave] That was bold.

30:43.400 --> 30:45.833
[Bili] For the design,
placement, layout,

30:45.900 --> 30:47.700
I think I did
a really good job.

30:47.767 --> 30:48.867
I didn't quite finish it.

30:51.367 --> 30:53.000
[Chris] We are here

30:53.067 --> 30:55.600
issuing you guys challenges
based on time.

30:55.667 --> 30:57.467
And we need to see
finished tattoos.

30:57.533 --> 30:58.867
Bad choice.

30:58.933 --> 31:00.333
There was a ton
of outlining,

31:00.400 --> 31:02.167
a lot of time was spent
with the stencil.

31:02.233 --> 31:03.333
And drawing,

31:03.400 --> 31:05.000
getting it perfectly symmetric
on his head--

31:05.067 --> 31:06.767
I don't like the fact
that you left the guy

31:06.833 --> 31:08.533
with scattered
shade marks.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.900
That dude's got to cruise around
like that.

31:10.967 --> 31:12.867
You're kicking yourself
out of the pack

31:12.933 --> 31:14.633
if you don't
finish your challenge.

31:20.333 --> 31:21.167
[Dave] James.

31:23.733 --> 31:25.833
This is another
monster tattoo from you.

31:27.367 --> 31:29.333
[James] Go big or go home.
If I don't finish,

31:29.400 --> 31:30.200
go home.

31:32.133 --> 31:33.633
[Oliver] Lots of line work.

31:33.700 --> 31:36.367
I think using the heraldry
around the outside,

31:36.433 --> 31:38.500
and making that stuff
solid black

31:38.567 --> 31:40.733
makes it blend well
with the tribal.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.700
I feel like you have
a really good eye

31:42.767 --> 31:44.367
for what your
capabilities are.

31:44.433 --> 31:47.300
You know, that's a good sign
in a tattooer.

31:49.367 --> 31:50.167
Thank you, sir.

31:52.933 --> 31:53.733
Lea.

31:54.967 --> 31:56.033
How do you think you did?

31:57.267 --> 31:59.467
[Lea] It was hard to do
perfect lines.

31:59.533 --> 32:00.933
We are judging
line work.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.767
Upon close inspection,

32:02.833 --> 32:05.300
there's a lot of shakiness.

32:05.367 --> 32:07.233
And a lot of points
where the lines

32:07.300 --> 32:09.867
just don't meet up
just right.

32:09.933 --> 32:12.233
This is a really,
really bad tattoo from you.

32:14.733 --> 32:16.233
You're looking at it.
You tell me,

32:16.300 --> 32:18.400
is this your level
of work?

32:19.367 --> 32:21.467
No, I was...
I was not happy.

32:21.533 --> 32:24.167
The first side,
the lines went okay,

32:24.233 --> 32:25.933
and I was
running out of time.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.800
It was hard to do,
like, perfect lines.

32:29.867 --> 32:32.000
[Chris] These lines
are incredibly shaky.

32:32.067 --> 32:33.067
This is bad.

32:38.067 --> 32:38.967
Jeremy.

32:40.733 --> 32:41.733
How'd it go, man?

32:41.800 --> 32:43.267
Tribal's definitely
not my thing.

32:43.333 --> 32:46.133
I haven't done it
in several years.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.367
[Chris] Technically,
this isn't sound, man.

32:48.433 --> 32:50.867
There's a lot of points
on the ends of your tips.

32:50.933 --> 32:54.500
When tribal comes to a point,
it's a point, it's not a period.

32:54.567 --> 32:55.700
[Oliver] We're judging lines.

32:55.767 --> 32:56.767
We want those lines.

32:56.833 --> 32:58.533
When they hit a gap

32:58.600 --> 33:00.467
and meet up on the other side
of that gap,

33:00.533 --> 33:03.667
we want them to look like
it's the same flow of the line.

33:03.733 --> 33:05.167
Did you notice
that you chewed up

33:05.233 --> 33:08.467
the left side
of the black on the wings?

33:08.533 --> 33:10.733
It wasn't chewed up
when I finished it.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.200
This is not
gonna heal solid.

33:12.267 --> 33:13.233
Fact.

33:15.833 --> 33:16.833
Tommy, step up.

33:18.600 --> 33:19.933
How do you feel
about how you did?

33:20.000 --> 33:21.300
[Tommy] I was happy about it.

33:21.367 --> 33:23.033
I tried to keep it
a feminine piece

33:23.100 --> 33:24.933
'cause it's on a girl's back.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.333
[Oliver] We're looking
at line work.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.833
What lines you did
put in this are clean.

33:28.900 --> 33:32.033
I think that
the task at hand being ...

33:32.100 --> 33:34.567
injecting your own
creativity into the tribal flow

33:34.633 --> 33:35.633
and making it your own,

33:35.700 --> 33:38.367
You, uh, definitely
succeeded with.

33:38.433 --> 33:39.400
Thanks, gentlemen.

33:42.100 --> 33:43.733
Josh, come on down
to the middle.

33:46.667 --> 33:47.600
Very impressive.

33:47.667 --> 33:49.600
Big tattoo,
knocked it out.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.467
Tribal, your own style.

33:53.533 --> 33:55.700
Very unique flare.

33:55.767 --> 33:57.400
Looking at this
line work really close,

33:57.467 --> 33:59.433
there's a few lines that are
a little bit overworked.

34:00.767 --> 34:02.233
That tender skin...

34:02.300 --> 34:04.333
Little tricky.

34:04.400 --> 34:07.467
[Chris] I don't like the line
going through the "S."

34:07.533 --> 34:09.067
It throws it off,
and it makes the letter

34:09.132 --> 34:11.699
look like a different letter
almost at first sight.

34:11.766 --> 34:13.800
That really throws my eye
on this thing.

34:19.000 --> 34:19.800
Al.

34:21.900 --> 34:23.833
-'Sup, gentlemen?
-How'd it go?

34:23.900 --> 34:25.132
It went good.

34:26.132 --> 34:27.867
I love that kind of tribal.

34:27.933 --> 34:29.967
First thing I got to say
right off the bat,

34:30.033 --> 34:31.867
is that lion head

34:31.933 --> 34:34.233
is facing his armpit.

34:36.367 --> 34:37.833
It would've been
a much stronger image

34:37.900 --> 34:39.266
with that lion
facing the center.

34:39.333 --> 34:42.333
If you look at a lot
of Polynesian chest pieces,

34:42.400 --> 34:45.199
they have those, like,
uh, totem pole faces,

34:45.266 --> 34:46.766
and they're facing that way.

34:46.833 --> 34:48.867
That's tattoo 101, man.

34:48.933 --> 34:49.900
You do faces,

34:49.967 --> 34:53.132
people, images, facing inward.

34:53.199 --> 34:54.833
I count that
as a design flaw.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.200
Alright, Shane.

35:04.867 --> 35:05.967
How'd it go with Ton, man?

35:06.033 --> 35:07.533
He's a little
intimidating, but...

35:08.633 --> 35:09.800
[Oliver] We can tell

35:09.867 --> 35:11.467
you didn't go over and over
these lines

35:11.533 --> 35:13.500
to make sure
they were smooth.

35:13.567 --> 35:16.267
I'm not saying every line
on here was one pass,

35:16.333 --> 35:18.933
but wherever you stopped
and started,

35:19.000 --> 35:21.100
it's pretty seamless.

35:21.167 --> 35:23.800
You laid lines down,
and you took it home.

35:23.867 --> 35:25.667
Thanks, man.

35:25.733 --> 35:28.533
Alright, guys, you can
head back to the Brownstone.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.500
For one of you,
it will be your last visit.

35:31.567 --> 35:32.933
'Cause after we deliberate,

35:33.000 --> 35:34.433
somebody's going home.

35:46.133 --> 35:49.233
He said my [bleep]
was facing the [bleep] armpit.

35:49.300 --> 35:50.633
I mean, is that a rule?

35:50.700 --> 35:52.767
-[man] Yep.
-[Lea] Yeah, it's a rule.

35:52.833 --> 35:54.933
But who makes
the [bleep] rule, though?

35:55.000 --> 35:57.233
Do you have to follow
those rules?

35:57.300 --> 35:58.400
[Shane] It just looks better

35:58.467 --> 35:59.867
facing the center of the chest,
not the armpit.

35:59.933 --> 36:01.500
[Shane] The freakin' lion
is, like,

36:01.567 --> 36:03.000
tucked into his armpit.

36:03.067 --> 36:04.000
Any person,
whether you're a tattooer,

36:04.067 --> 36:05.100
or an artist, or not,

36:05.167 --> 36:06.967
should be able
to look at that and think,

36:07.033 --> 36:10.700
"The lion clearly looks better
facing inwards, not the armpit."

36:10.767 --> 36:12.067
That was a big mistake.

36:12.133 --> 36:13.433
Like, what the [bleep]?

36:13.500 --> 36:15.100
[man] Get the [bleep] up
outta here.

36:21.300 --> 36:22.500
Did you feel
you pushed the envelope on it?

36:23.767 --> 36:25.067
-Not really--
-No, because it's tribal,

36:25.133 --> 36:26.533
and you hate it,
and you don't do it.

36:26.600 --> 36:27.667
[Jeremy] I haven't done it
in so long.

36:27.733 --> 36:30.033
I didn't know
how to judge

36:30.100 --> 36:32.100
how long that piece
was gonna take me.

36:32.167 --> 36:34.567
And one thing I did not
want to do was do too much

36:34.633 --> 36:35.767
and not be able
to finish.

36:35.833 --> 36:37.633
Because then that would
be two times in a row

36:37.700 --> 36:38.767
that I didn't
finish my tattoo.

36:41.233 --> 36:42.167
Alright, guys.

36:42.233 --> 36:43.300
it seems like
the playing field's

36:43.367 --> 36:44.500
getting a little bit tougher.

36:44.567 --> 36:46.067
[Chris] Time management
is gonna be everything

36:46.133 --> 36:47.233
for these guys.

36:47.300 --> 36:50.533
In my opinion,
Bili did the toughest tattoo.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.300
The tattoo looked good,

36:52.367 --> 36:54.333
and it's solid, and it was bold,

36:54.400 --> 36:56.233
and it was what
it's supposed to look like.

36:56.300 --> 36:58.633
it's unfair to not
give the kid the nod.

36:59.567 --> 37:01.100
In Lea's case...

37:01.167 --> 37:04.133
[Oliver] She's done
big tattoos every go.

37:04.200 --> 37:05.667
We haven't
seen her do a tattoo

37:05.733 --> 37:07.533
with enough
small detail in it to know

37:07.600 --> 37:08.500
if she even
has that ability.

37:09.533 --> 37:11.500
When it comes
to Jeremy's work,

37:11.567 --> 37:13.867
technically,
what was wrong with it?

37:13.933 --> 37:14.867
[Oliver] Points...

37:14.933 --> 37:16.633
looked like periods.

37:16.700 --> 37:19.300
[Chris] They come to a dot
at the end of a sentence.

37:19.367 --> 37:20.667
-[Dave] Right.
-You shouldn't have a dot

37:20.733 --> 37:22.867
at the end of a sentence,
you should have a clean line,

37:22.933 --> 37:24.933
and it should just
disappear into nothing.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.400
Now, what about Al?

37:26.467 --> 37:28.700
I mean, you pointed out the
lion's head going the wrong way.

37:28.767 --> 37:30.400
[Oliver]
That's a design flaw there,

37:30.467 --> 37:32.167
but as far as, like,
the actual quality of line work,

37:32.233 --> 37:35.167
there's no consistency at all.

37:35.233 --> 37:36.467
I feel like
we've come to a decision.

37:36.533 --> 37:38.300
-What do you think?
-I think so.

37:38.367 --> 37:39.900
I agree
with both you guys on this.

37:46.067 --> 37:47.533
Alright, guys.

37:48.500 --> 37:49.533
Here's the deal.

37:50.333 --> 37:52.767
We want to see Lea,

37:54.233 --> 37:55.133
Jeremy,

37:56.367 --> 37:57.467
Al,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.167
and James.
Meet us in the shop.

38:16.300 --> 38:17.333
So you all know
why you're here.

38:19.667 --> 38:21.533
One of you
is about to go home.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.400
James...

38:26.467 --> 38:28.900
we feel that
you had the best tattoo.

38:28.967 --> 38:29.933
Thank you.

38:30.767 --> 38:32.033
[Chris] You went big,

38:32.100 --> 38:34.067
put the tribal in there,

38:34.133 --> 38:35.600
lots of line work.

38:35.667 --> 38:37.500
I think that you have
a good grasp

38:37.567 --> 38:38.967
of what
you can accomplish.

38:39.033 --> 38:41.000
Congratulations.
Enjoy your win.

38:41.067 --> 38:41.933
Thank you.

38:44.233 --> 38:46.533
And that brings us
to the three of you.

38:52.533 --> 38:55.033
Jeremy,
you're back here again.

38:55.100 --> 38:58.900
Why do you feel that you should
remain here in this competition?

38:58.967 --> 39:00.767
I'm a good tattoo artist.

39:00.833 --> 39:05.100
And I haven't really had
my opportunity to prove that.

39:05.167 --> 39:06.633
That's not gonna
cut it for me.

39:06.700 --> 39:08.900
You know,
if you're doing tribal,

39:08.967 --> 39:10.500
and it's not your strong suit,

39:10.567 --> 39:11.767
this is your job.

39:11.833 --> 39:14.600
You guys have
to be able to do this.

39:14.667 --> 39:16.433
You're trying to keep
your neck above water,

39:16.500 --> 39:19.067
but I feel like there's a lot
of people in this competition

39:19.133 --> 39:21.833
that have a firmer grasp
on what they're doing.

39:25.067 --> 39:26.533
[Dave] Al.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.967
[Oliver] You came into
this competition guns blazing.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.933
Ready to show it off.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.067
I think what you need to do
is quit showing off

39:33.133 --> 39:34.833
with big, extravagant tattoos,

39:34.900 --> 39:39.033
and give us something quality
that we can see the detail in.

39:39.100 --> 39:41.967
Because your lines on this one
are very inconsistent.

39:45.467 --> 39:46.267
Lea.

39:47.167 --> 39:49.000
It's not clean work.

39:49.067 --> 39:51.933
These lines are
incredibly shaky.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.467
[Lea] I didn't think that
those lines were that bad.

39:55.533 --> 39:57.400
[Chris] This is one
of the worst tattoos I've seen.

39:57.467 --> 39:59.200
You guys came to compete.

39:59.267 --> 40:00.167
You're not hitting it.

40:03.433 --> 40:06.033
Lea, Jeremy, and Al,

40:06.100 --> 40:08.900
one of you
will be sent home.

40:10.867 --> 40:11.967
The judges have decided.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.133
Jeremy,

40:19.200 --> 40:21.900
you don't have what it takes
to be Ink Master.

40:24.533 --> 40:26.733
The quality that you show
in this competition

40:26.800 --> 40:29.700
proves to me that you can't do
a one-pass clean outline.

40:29.767 --> 40:31.667
Even though
I can't do tribal,

40:31.733 --> 40:33.900
if it would've been
a new-school challenge,

40:33.967 --> 40:35.167
I wouldn't
be standing here.

40:35.233 --> 40:37.633
It's gotta be all-school.
All-school.

40:38.867 --> 40:40.900
Jeremy, please pack up
your machines

40:41.700 --> 40:43.833
and close shop.

40:43.900 --> 40:45.933
[Jeremy] This definitely sucks
that I lost 100 grand.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.033
I might not be the tribal guy,

40:48.100 --> 40:50.000
but I'm good
at what I do.

40:54.600 --> 40:56.900
[announcer] On the next episode
of Ink Master...

40:56.967 --> 40:58.900
[Dave] We're testing you
on shading.

40:58.967 --> 41:01.533
Things just got a little bit
hotter up in here.

41:02.500 --> 41:03.433
I actually don't like

41:03.500 --> 41:04.500
-either of those looks.
-Neither?

41:04.567 --> 41:06.300
My clients are gonna be
the death of me.

41:06.367 --> 41:08.467
[Al] Bili is complaining
all the time.

41:08.533 --> 41:09.600
And the door's right there.

41:09.667 --> 41:10.967
Don't let it hit you
on the way out.

41:11.033 --> 41:12.967
You got elements
of the [bleep] things wrong.

41:13.033 --> 41:14.333
-Bull[bleep]!
-Just be real.

41:14.400 --> 41:17.400
If it was me, I'd be like,
"Yo, I [bleep] up."

41:17.467 --> 41:19.500
The winner of this thing
has to hit it all.

41:19.567 --> 41:21.900
You can't [bleep] the bed
in one place,

41:21.967 --> 41:23.433
and be great at the other.
