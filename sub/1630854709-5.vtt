00:18.280 --> 00:21.960
BABIECA DRIVING SCHOOL

00:24.839 --> 00:26.440
Does anyone know what this is?

00:28.679 --> 00:30.755
The speed limit on highways?

00:30.839 --> 00:32.355
Incorrect.

00:32.439 --> 00:36.039
It's our intensive 'Made in Cuenca'
method success rate.

00:37.320 --> 00:39.395
Celebrities who have passed through here:

00:39.479 --> 00:42.880
Paco León, Macaco,
El Juli and vice versa...

00:43.640 --> 00:45.159
Were they smarter than you?

00:45.840 --> 00:50.079
No, but they learned
because they enjoyed driving.

00:52.280 --> 00:55.075
- You, what's your name?
- Ángel.

00:55.159 --> 00:58.000
Ángel, why have you come
to Cuenca to get your license?

00:58.399 --> 01:00.499
Because they said
here it's easier to pass.

01:02.159 --> 01:03.320
Expelled.

01:04.159 --> 01:06.635
It's not "easier to pass" here.

01:06.719 --> 01:09.359
Passing here is like anywhere else,
am I clear?

01:10.319 --> 01:12.836
- Where are you going?
- You said I'm "expelled".

01:12.920 --> 01:14.799
It was a joke, pal, sit down.

01:16.280 --> 01:18.959
You, the one quiet in the back there.

01:19.799 --> 01:20.879
Why are you here?

01:22.519 --> 01:23.956
I'd rather you ask someone else.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.840
I'm asking you.
Why do you want to get your license?

01:28.040 --> 01:31.155
Well, so I can drive. The usual.

01:31.239 --> 01:33.159
Nothing usual about that.

01:33.959 --> 01:37.519
You usually get your license
when you're 20 and look at you.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.995
In the mornings,
we'll prep for the theoretical test

01:41.079 --> 01:43.355
doing several online mock test.

01:43.439 --> 01:45.760
And in the afternoons, practical lessons.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.079
OK, let's get started on the "tes".

01:56.920 --> 02:01.239
- I've already passed the theoretical test.
- Do you have your certificate?

02:03.079 --> 02:04.319
No, but I can get it.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.840
You were one
of Lorenzo's students, right?

02:09.520 --> 02:10.479
Yes.

02:10.879 --> 02:13.719
I don't know what my brother's said,
but we're in Cuenca.

02:14.599 --> 02:17.036
I can't ask each
student for their casuistry

02:17.120 --> 02:19.599
and adapt my training method
accordingly, you see.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.439
Do I have to take it again?

02:25.439 --> 02:28.716
You signed up for the full package.
I'll do my end of the deal.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.650
Up to you if you want to do the same.

02:41.039 --> 02:47.199
I DON'T LIKE DRIVING

02:48.479 --> 02:50.639
Hi, it's Iria. Leave a message.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.635
Hi, Iria.

02:52.719 --> 02:55.835
Just to say, I've taken a few days off
from the university

02:55.919 --> 02:57.400
and I've come to Cuenca.

02:58.039 --> 03:00.919
There's a school where you can get
your license in a week.

03:01.879 --> 03:03.520
We'll see if...

03:06.680 --> 03:07.599
Anyway...

03:08.199 --> 03:10.399
They say it's where all
the celebrities come.

03:10.919 --> 03:12.919
I haven't seen any so far.

03:13.719 --> 03:15.469
That's not why I'm here, obviously.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.675
They say you can get fast-tracked.

03:17.759 --> 03:19.360
They have a 95% success rate.

03:19.960 --> 03:23.479
I guess... you really have
to screw things up to flunk.

03:25.120 --> 03:28.355
Just wanted to let you know,
I'll be away for a few days.

03:28.439 --> 03:30.840
Take care. Big kiss. Bye.

03:50.120 --> 03:51.639
What are you afraid of?

03:53.039 --> 03:54.840
- Me?
- You look tense.

03:57.319 --> 03:59.569
You, looking at me like that
makes me nervous.

04:01.039 --> 04:03.156
- Lopetegui...
- Can we go by first names?

04:03.240 --> 04:04.395
No.

04:04.479 --> 04:07.276
We've started off the wrong foot,
I want you to pass.

04:07.360 --> 04:11.120
You have to gain confidence,
feel secure and vice versa.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.756
And I, so help me god,
I'm going to assist you.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.355
- For success rates.
- Exactly.

04:16.439 --> 04:18.889
The problem is you come
with many little habits...

04:19.399 --> 04:21.249
that my brother has drilled into you.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.480
Let's see if we can undo it in a week.

04:25.439 --> 04:27.115
What am I doing wrong?

04:27.199 --> 04:30.355
If you mean your life in general,
I'm sure everything,

04:30.439 --> 04:33.279
- but that's none of my business.
- I mean driving-wise.

04:34.439 --> 04:37.916
What's important is you like driving
and my brother hasn't taught you that.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.079
OK, so what now?

04:41.360 --> 04:44.920
Get comfy in the seat.
Relax your shoulders.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.516
Relax them. Relax.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.596
- Relax, damn it!
- I'm trying.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.875
Here, to enjoy driving

04:51.959 --> 04:54.195
all you gotta do is "fake it",
just pretend.

04:54.279 --> 04:57.040
If you don't like it,
just pretend, damn it.

04:57.639 --> 05:01.355
Lie to yourself,
I'm sure it's not the first time.

05:01.439 --> 05:03.516
- Pardon me?
- Just fucking relax!

05:03.600 --> 05:06.636
Relax! Come on! One, two, three... go!

05:06.720 --> 05:09.036
You like driving. Do you like to drive?

05:09.120 --> 05:11.279
- Yes?
- Can you feel it?

05:11.920 --> 05:14.396
- Not really.
- Not really

05:14.480 --> 05:16.360
Well, you'll catch on eventually.

05:17.279 --> 05:19.759
Come on, first gear
before it's Christmas.

05:25.399 --> 05:28.755
- Camino driving school.
- Hi, Elisa, it's Pablo.

05:28.839 --> 05:29.956
Hello, Pablo!

05:30.040 --> 05:33.279
Look, I'm going to need
my theory test certificate.

05:33.920 --> 05:36.636
Sure, come by whenever
and I'll give you a copy.

05:36.720 --> 05:39.076
I can't, actually. Can you send it to me?

05:39.160 --> 05:40.319
Where?

05:41.040 --> 05:43.636
- Can you fax it?
- Fax it?

05:43.720 --> 05:44.875
Or e-mail it?

05:44.959 --> 05:48.000
Why don't you download it from
the DfT app? Do you have it?

05:48.720 --> 05:50.076
The app? No.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.079
Download it, it's all there.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.476
- OK. Great, thank you.
- Everything OK?

05:55.560 --> 05:58.040
- Yeah, it's all good.
- You sound a little...

06:05.480 --> 06:09.315
Sorry, I've been trying to download
this app and it's not happening.

06:09.399 --> 06:12.800
Sometimes it's the wifi,
but I'm sure it's not that.

06:13.360 --> 06:14.879
So what is it then?

06:15.199 --> 06:18.800
Certain apps aren't compatible
with your cell phone's operating system.

06:19.839 --> 06:21.589
What's my phone's operating system?

06:21.879 --> 06:23.555
I don't know. I'm not...

06:23.639 --> 06:25.516
Why did you say it doesn't work?

06:25.600 --> 06:27.276
No, I said maybe...

06:27.360 --> 06:28.435
No, no, no, no, no.

06:28.519 --> 06:31.195
You first said
it doesn't work on my phone.

06:31.279 --> 06:33.679
- I'm just saying.
- "I'm just saying" means nil.

06:34.399 --> 06:36.875
Not only do words matter,
they are essential.

06:36.959 --> 06:38.916
If they didn't, then why care at all.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.500
No. Choose your words with
a bit more care, please.

06:43.160 --> 06:44.920
Yes... if you don't mind.

06:46.439 --> 06:48.480
Hotel Astoria Cuenca, good evening.

06:49.079 --> 06:50.040
Yes.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.315
- Next round is on me.
- Let's see, please.

06:54.399 --> 06:56.749
- Can we order another round?
- No, it's closed.

06:57.519 --> 06:59.160
Let's party in my room!

07:26.439 --> 07:27.920
Please!

07:30.160 --> 07:32.600
- It's the old guy?
- Tell him to come over.

07:43.879 --> 07:46.235
It's recording. Just say it, damn it.

07:46.319 --> 07:48.836
Even though Daniel is a famous singer,

07:48.920 --> 07:51.716
here he's just another student
looking for a wheel deal.

07:51.800 --> 07:55.156
Daniel Selvas, thank you
for choosing Babieca Driving School.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.235
Everyone knows you pass faster here,

07:57.319 --> 07:58.636
but what I always say:

07:58.720 --> 08:01.759
You don't count the days,
you make the days count.

08:02.639 --> 08:04.040
Daniel, do the lion!

08:10.560 --> 08:13.596
- I'm in love.
- Me too.

08:13.680 --> 08:16.516
As you all know,
Daniel couldn't start yesterday

08:16.600 --> 08:18.795
because of a professional commitment,

08:18.879 --> 08:22.916
but today we're just going
to keep on trucking.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.959
Sorry, did you not hear what I said?

08:26.800 --> 08:27.759
Sorry.

08:28.720 --> 08:32.236
Here he wants to be like everybody else
and we're going to respect that.

08:32.320 --> 08:33.600
This isn't some fan club.

08:34.120 --> 08:37.480
Well, we're all big fans,
but you catch my drift.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.000
Sorry.

08:40.759 --> 08:42.679
- If you don't mind...
- Excuse me?

08:43.120 --> 08:45.120
Did you not hear him? Please, no photos.

08:45.720 --> 08:46.876
Who me?

08:46.960 --> 08:48.840
Let's get started with the "tes".

08:49.360 --> 08:53.315
By the way, if anybody here thinks
they don't have to take the "tes",

08:53.399 --> 08:56.516
because supposedly they already
passed the theoretical "tes",

08:56.600 --> 08:59.396
without real proof,
feel free to do whatever you like.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.720
It's a free country.

09:02.440 --> 09:05.919
That person can just get up
and go home if he wish.

09:17.399 --> 09:21.435
- Satur, by our first name?
- Of course, Daniel, no need to ask.

09:21.519 --> 09:24.195
I've been driving
since I was five years old.

09:24.279 --> 09:26.315
One thing's driving another's a license.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.879
For starters,
both hands on the steering wheel,

09:29.279 --> 09:32.036
I can also reach up to 240
on the Tarancón road

09:32.120 --> 09:35.075
and drive with my knees,
which I'm not allowed to teach,

09:35.159 --> 09:37.916
that's just me. I always say

09:38.000 --> 09:41.675
your guardian angel can be sleeping
on the job, so watch out.

09:41.759 --> 09:45.240
If you want a photo, you can just ask
and we'll take one, no problem.

09:45.799 --> 09:48.699
But right now I'm trying to focus,
a little bit of respect.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.276
I'm not taking your photo.
I don't know who you are or care.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.435
Sure you know who I am. How do you not.

09:54.519 --> 09:57.916
Daniel, concentrate, distractions
at the wheel cause accidents.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.675
It's easy-peasy, Satur.

09:59.759 --> 10:02.159
Daniel, just like I told Mr. Lopetegui.

10:02.600 --> 10:06.116
Everyone's on equal footing here,
no favoritism.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.236
Exactly.

10:07.320 --> 10:09.595
If someone's likable or not differs,

10:09.679 --> 10:12.840
but in principle zero favoritism.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.675
- Hello?
- This is room 209.

10:39.759 --> 10:42.609
This is the second night they're
having a party next door.

10:43.159 --> 10:47.120
- A party?
- Music, screams, noise... listen.

10:50.279 --> 10:52.360
- Can you hear it?
- No.

10:52.840 --> 10:54.595
Who's making the noise?

10:54.679 --> 10:56.080
The driving school people.

10:56.559 --> 10:59.356
Well, you know what these kids are like,

10:59.440 --> 11:03.236
They come to spend a week here
and like to let off a little steam.

11:03.320 --> 11:04.679
No big deal.

11:05.399 --> 11:07.639
You're also enrolled in Babieca, right?

11:08.559 --> 11:10.156
Yes, so?

11:10.240 --> 11:12.039
Why aren't you at the party?

11:18.519 --> 11:19.969
Because I don't feel like it.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.600
Is Satur teaching you?

11:22.960 --> 11:26.310
- What does that have to do with anything?
- Satur is the best, huh?

11:26.480 --> 11:28.030
I also got my license with him.

11:28.440 --> 11:31.756
Satur is a big deal here in Cuenca,

11:31.840 --> 11:35.639
he knows everyone because
he's also a city councilor... and more.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.276
Like what?

11:39.360 --> 11:41.510
Well, things.
A little bit of this and that.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.955
Do you have another room
on another floor?

11:44.039 --> 11:46.636
No, no, no. It's fully booked.

11:46.720 --> 11:50.955
- Have you checked?
- Yes, I'm checking right now.

11:51.039 --> 11:52.519
It's all fully booked.

12:30.200 --> 12:33.759
Can I have coffee with milk, please?
Decaf better.

12:35.039 --> 12:36.399
Ever notice.

12:37.159 --> 12:40.159
How folks go out for drinks
with their babies in strollers...

12:41.360 --> 12:44.519
I know Cuenca isn't exactly small,
but you get what I mean.

12:45.279 --> 12:48.315
- Did you check out of the hotel?
- It's impossible to sleep

12:48.399 --> 12:50.720
with your fan's constant partying.

12:51.240 --> 12:53.036
Why aren't you hanging with them?

12:53.120 --> 12:55.620
Waiting for it to warm up.
I'll drop by last thing.

12:56.159 --> 12:58.559
Ah, of course. They're just warming up.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.520
You don't like me very much, do you?

13:02.720 --> 13:04.156
I'm indifferent.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.320
Then why?

13:06.200 --> 13:08.720
Why are you so defensive?
So awkward all the time.

13:09.759 --> 13:11.240
Not because of you for sure.

13:13.279 --> 13:15.916
Maybe because I'm starting
to run thin on time

13:16.000 --> 13:18.600
that I can spend
on getting my goddamn license.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.440
You have blocked trauma.

13:21.960 --> 13:24.919
And it won't go until
you figure it out and sort it out.

13:26.600 --> 13:30.039
Well, honestly, I've always thought
driving is for chumps.

13:30.559 --> 13:33.000
Your problem is you dislike everyone.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.639
Could be.

13:35.519 --> 13:37.120
Before this I was a bullfighter.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.879
And now I'm a singer,
but I was a bullfighter.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.799
I didn't quit because I was scared.
I wasn't scared.

13:44.279 --> 13:46.156
Once I was in front of a bull

13:46.240 --> 13:49.835
and I felt... I too felt like an animal,

13:49.919 --> 13:51.399
specifically a lion.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.720
And can a lion kill a bull?

13:57.279 --> 14:00.480
Why not?
In theory, it's totally possible.

14:02.240 --> 14:05.080
I know you don't believe me.
You don't believe me.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.399
I am a lion.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.240
I'm not an isolated case.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.236
Of people who are animals?

14:12.320 --> 14:13.315
- Yes...
- No.

14:13.399 --> 14:16.000
We are animals.

14:17.039 --> 14:20.480
It hindered my chances in
the bullring but not on stage.

14:21.799 --> 14:24.080
- Want to hear me roar?
- No thanks.

14:24.480 --> 14:25.600
Sorry.

14:33.960 --> 14:34.879
What?

14:36.240 --> 14:39.236
- Good night.
- No, wait a minute.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.639
If you could be any animal
which would you be?

14:46.519 --> 14:48.675
- Hi, good evening.
- Good evening.

14:48.759 --> 14:49.759
Do you have a room?

14:50.200 --> 14:52.399
- How many do you need?
- Just one.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.595
Ah, since you said "rooms".

14:55.679 --> 14:58.675
- I was just saying.
- "I was just saying", no.

14:58.759 --> 15:00.639
Words are important.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.240
Words have meaning so choose carefully.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.050
Do you have a room yes or no?

15:08.440 --> 15:11.555
You're the Madrid professor
enrolled with Satur, right?

15:11.639 --> 15:13.075
How do you know?

15:13.159 --> 15:16.919
News travels fast around here,
and if Satur's involved...

15:17.879 --> 15:19.159
What about Satur?

15:21.240 --> 15:23.756
I'm sorry, we're fully booked.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.360
- No vacancy?
- Nothing.

15:32.519 --> 15:33.879
Mind if I sit over there?

15:34.440 --> 15:35.679
To sleep?

15:36.120 --> 15:38.000
Never mind. Good night.

15:51.440 --> 15:53.955
Guys, I'm going to sleep I'm exhausted.

15:54.039 --> 15:55.159
Yeah, me too.

16:08.879 --> 16:11.679
ARTURO MACÍAS BRAVE SCHOONER

16:29.039 --> 16:30.279
Hello. Yolanda?

16:31.240 --> 16:33.159
Hello, how are you? It's Lopetegui.

16:34.600 --> 16:35.600
Lopetegui.

16:37.759 --> 16:39.600
There is your certificate.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.279
Thank you.

16:44.840 --> 16:45.919
Thank you.

16:46.840 --> 16:50.290
I would have asked my wife,
but we're not getting along at the moment.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.840
Now I understand why you look so down.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.420
That's because
I haven't slept in two days.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.320
So then? What's the scene in Cuenca like?

16:58.879 --> 16:59.840
Why?

17:00.480 --> 17:01.960
You want to hit the town?

17:02.559 --> 17:03.879
Maybe.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.160
Aren't you upset?

17:07.200 --> 17:09.116
Because what I told you after the exam.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.400
Ah, that talent isn't inherited?

17:12.720 --> 17:15.599
I knew you didn't mean it,
because you then gave me an A.

17:16.720 --> 17:19.515
I'd boost your grade
for bringing my certificate,

17:19.599 --> 17:21.519
but I've never given anyone an A+.

17:28.720 --> 17:31.720
Did Ramon give you any flack when
you picked up the car?

17:32.119 --> 17:34.400
Not at all. He thinks I'm your mistress.

17:35.160 --> 17:38.599
- Don't say things like that Yolanda.
- I didn't say anything.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.475
I can't wait to see the look
on Satur's face when he sees this.

17:43.559 --> 17:45.916
I'm dying to meet Lorenzo's
legendary brother,

17:46.000 --> 17:47.500
Is he a scumbag like they say?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.720
He's an idiot.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.599
To mess with me,
he refers to me as mister.

17:53.279 --> 17:57.636
He thinks vice versa means etcetera.
Attention, vice versa means etcetera.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.559
I hope you haven't corrected him.

18:00.160 --> 18:02.720
I hope you haven't driven
from Madrid like that.

18:03.119 --> 18:04.640
- Like what?
- Like...

18:04.960 --> 18:07.035
Having a license is different to driving.

18:07.119 --> 18:10.316
To start with,
both hands on the steering wheel.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.039
Ten and two.
That's eleven and one. Ten and two.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.720
That's it. Look forward.

18:18.200 --> 18:21.235
- So, satisfied?
- I told you on the first day,

18:21.319 --> 18:23.469
it's the whole
nine yards for everyone here.

18:24.200 --> 18:27.195
But is it valid or not?
It has the official DfT stamp.

18:27.279 --> 18:28.240
Yolanda, please...

18:28.640 --> 18:31.356
What kind of father brings
his own daughter to bail him out?

18:31.440 --> 18:34.515
- She's my student not my daughter.
- And Lorenzo's too.

18:34.599 --> 18:37.235
Even worse. What's my brother
taught you? To complain?

18:37.319 --> 18:39.235
Let me tell you, it never works.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.435
Lorenzo is a very good teacher.

18:41.519 --> 18:44.400
At least he doesn't bully you in class.
He's an educator.

18:45.519 --> 18:48.235
My brother can be as much
of an educator as you want,

18:48.319 --> 18:50.916
I'm an entrepreneur.
Excuse me, I have a class.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.356
- Since when with the first names?
- Please...

18:53.440 --> 18:55.556
You don't teach we just do mock tests.

18:55.640 --> 18:58.396
By the way pronounced tests, not "tes".

18:58.480 --> 19:00.556
And vice versa is not etcetera.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.839
You're getting them confused.

19:03.720 --> 19:06.995
- Sorry, I couldn't resist.
- No, I'm glad you brought it up.

19:07.079 --> 19:09.116
Any 5th grader knows that etcetera

19:09.200 --> 19:11.156
means when you list a series of things.

19:11.240 --> 19:13.396
Vice versa doesn't.
I mean the other way...

19:13.480 --> 19:16.755
The only person getting things
mixed up is you professor.

19:16.839 --> 19:19.240
Ready. Use vice versa
correctly in a sentence.

19:19.640 --> 19:22.559
Enlighten me. Use vice versa correctly.

19:24.400 --> 19:27.039
To get your license, you have
to take both tests.

19:27.400 --> 19:31.150
The theoretical test is worthless without
the practical test and vice versa.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.836
Nailed it that time.

19:34.920 --> 19:38.515
It's practically impossible
for a student to fail in this school.

19:38.599 --> 19:39.880
Practically.

19:40.279 --> 19:42.440
But in a bag there's always a bad nut.

19:51.839 --> 19:52.880
Excuse me.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.035
The driving school called.

19:55.119 --> 19:57.680
You must vacate
the room as soon as possible.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.680
But I've paid for the entire week.

20:01.119 --> 20:03.995
Satur personally called
to say the package is canceled.

20:04.079 --> 20:07.356
- I'm not vacating my room.
- But we're heading to Madrid.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.640
- I don't feel like it now.
- Sir, please don't put me in a bind.

20:11.279 --> 20:14.275
Here Satur is a councilman
among other things.

20:14.359 --> 20:15.836
Like what?

20:15.920 --> 20:18.880
For everyone's sake, vacate the hotel.

20:22.200 --> 20:23.759
I finished your book.

20:26.319 --> 20:27.519
My novel?

20:29.480 --> 20:32.636
The ending resembling
"The Sixth Sense" was the least of it.

20:32.720 --> 20:36.079
Right? I've always maintained
it was a minor coincidence.

20:36.759 --> 20:37.680
Yes.

20:38.359 --> 20:42.356
The worst is the long-winded digressions
that completely drags you away.

20:42.440 --> 20:46.275
Switching points of view for
no apparent reason, Lopetegui.

20:46.359 --> 20:49.279
- Plot inconsistencies...
- Like which?

20:51.119 --> 20:54.000
Sorry, but you're
the one who taught me literary analysis.

20:56.839 --> 20:59.240
No, that analysis sounds just fine.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.755
I finished it at least,

21:02.839 --> 21:05.079
because my dad
didn't get passed chapter one.

21:06.119 --> 21:07.719
You gave it to your dad to read?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.675
I've spoken to dad about you.

21:09.759 --> 21:13.000
Why not? You're my professor
and you're both writers.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.200
Well, one more than the other.

21:16.519 --> 21:18.469
If you knew him, you wouldn't say that.

21:19.440 --> 21:23.039
He's a proper writer.
I'm just frustrated.

21:26.240 --> 21:28.556
Those things are mutually compatible.

21:28.640 --> 21:29.640
Well, yes.

21:34.039 --> 21:35.995
Professor, where are you going?

21:36.079 --> 21:38.480
Aren't you...? Holy crap, you're him!

21:39.440 --> 21:42.079
- Nice to meet you, Daniel Selvas.
- Hello.

21:42.680 --> 21:45.076
Of course, the driving school for celebs.

21:45.160 --> 21:46.519
Want a drink in my room?

21:47.160 --> 21:48.960
I've asked the others to come by.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.675
Your friend can come along, if she wants.

21:51.759 --> 21:54.515
No. She's not my friend,
she's my student from uni.

21:54.599 --> 21:56.275
We were just leaving.

21:56.359 --> 21:58.675
It's only Wednesday.
What about your license?

21:58.759 --> 22:01.039
Forget the license. Not happening.

22:01.599 --> 22:03.039
I might stick around.

22:04.160 --> 22:05.079
What?

22:06.160 --> 22:09.240
Lopetegui, Daniel Selvas
is inviting us to a party.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.319
It's low key, no photos.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.000
It may get a little rowdy later on.

22:14.319 --> 22:15.569
I can't promise anything.

22:16.440 --> 22:18.475
Suit yourself. I'm leaving.

22:18.559 --> 22:21.680
- How are you going to get back?
- Driving, give me the keys.

22:22.119 --> 22:23.596
If the cops pull you over?

22:23.680 --> 22:25.316
I could care less, arrest me.

22:25.400 --> 22:27.916
And if banned from getting
my license, better.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.636
Enough, just let him go.

22:29.720 --> 22:30.640
Exactly.

22:30.960 --> 22:33.359
Seeing that I'm already all
the way out here...

22:34.480 --> 22:35.640
Very well.

22:37.440 --> 22:38.920
Just so you know he's a lion.

22:39.759 --> 22:41.596
Yeah, I already noticed.

22:41.680 --> 22:43.830
No, no. I'm being serious.
He's a real lion.

22:44.720 --> 22:47.359
Yeah, yeah, I've noticed.

22:48.079 --> 22:49.920
Well take care.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.920
What is he, your dad?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.720
STORIES

24:51.599 --> 24:54.195
Elena's family Sunday meal

24:54.279 --> 24:57.435
always consisted of
a garlic soup as a starter

24:57.519 --> 24:59.759
and baked lamb as a main course.

25:00.079 --> 25:03.275
The two dishes that Elena
despised above all others were,

25:03.359 --> 25:06.680
in this order,
garlic soup and baked lamb.

25:25.960 --> 25:27.396
Don't give it another thought.

25:27.480 --> 25:29.715
The more you think on it,
the longer it'll take.

25:29.799 --> 25:33.475
Babieca driving school,
we are the wheel deal.

25:33.559 --> 25:36.680
My sword was Tizona

25:37.160 --> 25:40.116
And my horse Babieca

25:40.200 --> 25:43.275
My sword was Tizona

25:43.359 --> 25:46.636
You were my Doña Jimena

25:46.720 --> 25:50.035
I crossed a sad desert

25:50.119 --> 25:53.440
Which looked like Arizona

25:59.839 --> 26:02.955
It was a land of the unfaithful

26:03.039 --> 26:06.515
Full of gypsies and non-gypsies

26:06.599 --> 26:09.275
It was a land of the unfaithful

26:09.359 --> 26:12.880
What I saw on the back of my horse
