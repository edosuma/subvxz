WEBVTT

00:49.680 --> 00:51.720
Let's go! Let's go!

05:49.360 --> 05:50.600
How's the Rock?

05:50.840 --> 05:52.080
Full of mice.

05:53.280 --> 05:56.040
-It's only for a few weeks.
-And it's freezing.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.400
How's Professor Lehmann?

05:59.640 --> 06:01.120
Good mood, bad mood?

06:02.680 --> 06:06.200
-Depends who she's talking to.
-Probably better that it's not me, then.

06:06.360 --> 06:08.520
Which is why I'm calling, not her.

06:10.480 --> 06:11.520
So what's up?

06:11.680 --> 06:14.600
She just revised the section
of the seabed she wants mapped.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.120
-I'll send you the new specs.
-Okay.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.160
What?

06:20.440 --> 06:24.840
She wants readings with the AUV
running at 25 meters above the seafloor,

06:25.080 --> 06:26.680
before it runs at ten.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.880
Rahim, that's hundreds of kilometers.

06:30.120 --> 06:32.800
-I know.
-I'll be stuck here all summer!

06:33.280 --> 06:36.720
-I know.
-Why do I have to start at 25 meters?

06:36.960 --> 06:38.640
So you don't run the AUV aground.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.680
-Like you did...
-Last time, I know.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.680
So no short-cuts, okay?

06:44.160 --> 06:45.440
Charlie!

06:45.600 --> 06:47.680
-We missed you last night!
-Last night?

06:47.920 --> 06:50.480
I have a very sloppy text from you
at five this morning.

06:50.640 --> 06:52.400
Did you even go to bed?

06:52.560 --> 06:54.360
I can sleep on the flight.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.840
-Anything you need?
-Where do I start?

06:58.800 --> 07:01.160
If you think of anything, let me know.

07:05.080 --> 07:07.720
Something strange is happening,
I've got to go.

07:11.080 --> 07:12.320
Okay.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.600
Shit.

11:43.040 --> 11:46.640
Best we can figure, it washed up
on the beach an hour ago.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.520
Came in with the high tide.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.120
A dog walker spotted it.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.880
Said it was already dead.

11:53.960 --> 11:54.960
He.

11:55.800 --> 11:58.120
-What?
-He's a male.

11:59.040 --> 12:02.560
Was part of a pod that migrated
to Vancouver Island every year.

12:03.080 --> 12:04.840
Haven't seen him since last season.

12:21.200 --> 12:24.720
Wind direction is north, north-westerly.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.800
He's not been dead
much more than two, maybe three hours.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.120
-So that would put him about...
-Murray Cove.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.320
Let's see what they have to say.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.640
Can you cordon this off? Someone from
the Institute will be down to cover him.

12:40.880 --> 12:42.960
You think they're bite marks?

12:44.800 --> 12:46.440
What's gonna bite an orca?

13:31.200 --> 13:33.400
-Leon.
-How are you, Kit?

13:36.040 --> 13:37.760
-Jack.
-Kit.

13:37.920 --> 13:40.120
-It's been a while.
-Too long.

13:41.720 --> 13:44.320
Kit, did you hear anything
about the orca

13:44.480 --> 13:46.440
that washed up on the beach
this morning?

13:49.320 --> 13:51.080
Finish up for me,
I'll be back in a minute.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.800
Yeah.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.360
I'll show you something.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.080
You're saying an orca did this?

14:18.680 --> 14:21.520
I spoke to the guys.
It happened early hours this morning.

14:21.680 --> 14:24.240
Swam close to the boat a couple times.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.680
They thought it was just being curious
until it started to get aggressive.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.840
They tried to push it aside,
but it just kept coming,

14:31.000 --> 14:34.280
smashing into the side of the boat,
acting all crazy.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.800
A whale that big, in a boat this size?

14:38.560 --> 14:41.640
They had no choice but to fight back
with billhooks, blades.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.280
-Anything that came to hand.
-No choice?

14:45.600 --> 14:49.280
Do you really think
they'd fight an orca for a few fish?

14:49.520 --> 14:51.520
Catches are dropping off.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.680
Put an animal between a man
and the object of his attention

14:54.840 --> 14:57.040
and you'd be surprised what he'll do.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.720
Nobody around here
would want to see an orca hurt.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.960
If the guys say it attacked,

15:02.120 --> 15:03.240
then it did.

15:04.800 --> 15:05.800
I gotta get back.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.320
-I'll see you around, Leon.
-See you around.

15:46.640 --> 15:47.960
Charlie!

15:52.800 --> 15:54.600
Welcome to the Rock.

15:54.760 --> 15:57.040
-How long can you stay?
-We can't.

15:57.280 --> 16:01.160
We have to get to the Juno
and the chopper back to base by tonight.

16:01.680 --> 16:03.280
Can you guys give me a hand here?

16:03.440 --> 16:05.240
Nice to see you too, Tomas.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.920
-What happened?
-No idea.

16:12.160 --> 16:15.200
It lost propulsion.
I picked it up and brought it back.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.680
The insulation looks like it's melted.

16:21.400 --> 16:24.400
-You checked it before you launched it?
-Of course I checked it.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.920
There were no frayed or loose wires?

16:30.080 --> 16:34.000
I know how to run a pre-launch check
on an AUV, Tomas.

16:34.240 --> 16:36.080
Then how do you explain this?

16:36.320 --> 16:39.760
I can't.
I told you, it just lost propulsion.

16:43.240 --> 16:44.920
Are you sure you didn't cause it?

16:45.680 --> 16:48.560
-What's he saying?
-I'm saying she's covering her ass.

16:48.720 --> 16:51.400
-Just leave the parts, okay? I'll do it.
-I'll do it, yeah?

16:51.560 --> 16:54.120
If you burn out another one,
it's my ass on the line.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.760
So when do you sail?

17:07.680 --> 17:09.160
Tomorrow, from Húsavík.

17:12.240 --> 17:16.120
It'll be good to get out of the lab.
Spend some time in the field.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.640
It'll be great.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.000
I wish you were coming.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.240
And miss all this?

17:25.040 --> 17:26.760
Work is important, you know.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.280
The data the AUVs collect is important.

17:30.440 --> 17:33.360
But operating them
is a job for a first-year student.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.320
We both know why I'm here.

17:35.840 --> 17:39.000
I'll do the job, stick to the rules,
and all will be forgiven.

17:39.240 --> 17:40.480
Until next time.

18:51.760 --> 18:52.840
Hi.

18:54.920 --> 18:57.680
-A whiskey.
-We have a lot of that.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.680
Any one in particular?

19:00.520 --> 19:04.120
-A good one.
-Can't go wrong with a MacNally.

19:07.560 --> 19:08.600
Sure.

19:09.560 --> 19:11.280
Make it two, Iona.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.320
So what did you do, then?

19:21.600 --> 19:22.680
Sorry?

19:22.840 --> 19:25.800
The guy here last summer,
up at the station...

19:26.040 --> 19:27.360
Stefan?

19:28.400 --> 19:30.520
-That's the one.
-What about him?

19:30.680 --> 19:33.520
He told me,
back in Germany, he started a fire.

19:34.680 --> 19:36.840
Aye, almost burnt the lab down.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.560
I didn't start a fire,
if that's what you're asking.

19:39.800 --> 19:41.440
So what was it then?

19:44.960 --> 19:47.000
I like doing things my own way.

19:47.560 --> 19:50.280
How does that go down with your bosses?

19:50.520 --> 19:52.160
Faculty advisor.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.800
Not well.

19:56.560 --> 19:59.560
So when you're not getting up
their noses, what do you do?

19:59.720 --> 20:01.720
Trying to finish my PhD.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.000
In...?

20:04.800 --> 20:06.600
I don't want to bore you.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.480
Try me.

20:13.920 --> 20:17.640
Monitoring tidal fluctuation and other
possible stressors on the ecosystem

20:17.800 --> 20:20.080
like overfishing, water pollution...

20:20.240 --> 20:21.680
Overfishing?

20:21.840 --> 20:24.720
That's a controversial term around here.

20:25.560 --> 20:28.000
Well, stocks are
on the edge of collapse.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.880
I'd call that overfishing, wouldn't you?

20:30.040 --> 20:32.280
Or men trying to feed their families.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.040
Not if the fish run out.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.840
So what do you do?

20:47.360 --> 20:48.640
I'm a fisherman.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.840
Of course you are.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.280
Douglas McKinnon.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.560
-That's Iona.
-Hi.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.840
Charlie Wagner.

21:00.080 --> 21:03.160
So if you ever want any fresh fish,
I go by the station most mornings.

21:03.320 --> 21:04.640
I don't eat fish.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.560
Of course you don't.

21:17.040 --> 21:20.320
I'm not usually so abrasive,
not on first meeting, anyway.

21:21.440 --> 21:22.920
Thanks for the warning.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.360
So, drinks on me?

21:27.520 --> 21:28.800
Iona?

21:28.960 --> 21:31.080
Well, thank you very much.

21:31.240 --> 21:34.360
-You can come again.
-Aye. She can.

21:54.960 --> 21:56.960
Thanks for getting back to me.

21:57.480 --> 22:01.400
No, I'm actually looking at the effect
of seismic surveys on marine animals.

22:01.560 --> 22:05.120
And I read your report on
geological studies and oil exploration.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.840
Yes, I'm from
the World Oceanographic Commission.

22:08.080 --> 22:10.600
It'd be wonderful
if we could schedule a proper interview.

22:11.360 --> 22:14.440
Well, I'm based in Canada
for another month.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.760
Yeah, a video call would work.

22:18.560 --> 22:21.640
It's Alicia Delaware.
Yes, like the state.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.440
At "woc.org."

22:25.160 --> 22:26.720
I appreciate it.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.400
Talk to you then.

22:37.640 --> 22:39.480
I heard about the orca.

22:41.280 --> 22:44.520
First whale of the season,
and it washes up dead.

22:45.600 --> 22:46.600
Yeah.

22:54.120 --> 22:56.160
What do you think is going on?

22:59.520 --> 23:02.200
-They've been late before.
-Not this late.

23:05.120 --> 23:08.120
I'm sorry, you've kind of
caught me at a bad time.

23:08.280 --> 23:10.040
Okay. Sorry.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.320
I'll catch you later.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.600
I guess there's a first for everything.

26:39.280 --> 26:42.760
-I usually do the ducking out.
-This must be new for you.

26:43.440 --> 26:45.640
I'm a big boy. I can handle it.

26:46.440 --> 26:48.520
If you pull the door,
it locks on the inside.

26:48.680 --> 26:51.320
And there's coffee over there
if you want.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.440
Believe it or not,

26:57.480 --> 26:59.800
I was going to invite you to breakfast.

27:00.480 --> 27:02.400
I'm not a breakfast person.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.200
Clearly.

27:05.800 --> 27:09.240
I need to launch some equipment, so...

27:10.360 --> 27:12.800
-It won't take long.
-There's a storm blowing in.

27:13.040 --> 27:16.120
-It could be dangerous out there.
-I'll be back in no time.

27:16.280 --> 27:19.200
Is there anything I can say
to persuade you otherwise?

27:24.960 --> 27:26.560
Thought as much.

27:31.120 --> 27:33.080
-What are you doing?
-Coming with you.

27:33.240 --> 27:35.520
-I know what I'm doing.
-Oh, I don't doubt that.

27:35.680 --> 27:38.160
But even I wouldn't
go out there on my own.

27:39.680 --> 27:42.720
-Not even going to shower?
-Would you wait for me?

27:42.960 --> 27:44.920
-No.
-There you go then.

28:06.800 --> 28:08.200
Alright. On three.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.320
One, two, three...

28:19.200 --> 28:20.600
-Okay.
-Good.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.800
Hey, do you see that?

28:42.920 --> 28:44.400
What the hell is that?

28:46.640 --> 28:47.760
Pass me that hook?

28:50.840 --> 28:51.840
Thank you.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.080
Okay.

29:07.600 --> 29:09.440
Do you have a lighter?

29:13.880 --> 29:15.120
Thank you.

29:20.480 --> 29:21.960
Jeez.

29:23.480 --> 29:25.280
It's methane hydrate.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.200
"Fire ice."

29:27.360 --> 29:29.160
Dead algae sink,

29:29.400 --> 29:31.080
and get buried in the seabed.

29:31.240 --> 29:34.560
When they break apart, they release
methane, which then freezes.

29:34.720 --> 29:37.480
Sometimes pieces break free
and float to the surface.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.480
Looks like a hell of a lot.

29:45.440 --> 29:47.440
More than just a few pieces.

30:38.680 --> 30:39.760
Nice.

30:40.720 --> 30:43.520
You've got a few minutes,
just setting up the call.

30:54.280 --> 30:55.560
Hi, guys.

30:55.720 --> 30:58.000
Charlie, we got the footage.

30:58.600 --> 31:01.240
I have a very important question
for you:

31:02.560 --> 31:04.360
Who's the dude on the boat?

31:08.160 --> 31:10.880
-His name is Douglas.
-We have a name!

31:11.040 --> 31:12.880
He's a friend, just a friend.

31:13.120 --> 31:15.520
-Now will you all kindly fuck off?
-She's here.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.280
Let's get started.

31:28.840 --> 31:31.160
And this was limited to this spot?

31:31.600 --> 31:33.760
I'm going to go back out
and check a few other areas,

31:33.920 --> 31:35.400
see how widespread it is.

31:35.640 --> 31:38.680
-How deep is the water there?
-About 800 meters.

31:39.680 --> 31:43.000
But I checked the tidal flow,
temperature and water pressure,

31:43.160 --> 31:46.080
and I think the hydrates
would've broken free of the seabed

31:46.240 --> 31:48.200
at a depth of 600 meters.

31:48.360 --> 31:51.880
Put the ADCP
in downward-looking mode on the AUV

31:52.120 --> 31:53.560
to measure the currents.

31:53.720 --> 31:55.880
See if you can confirm the location.

31:56.040 --> 31:57.560
-Will do.
-Send me the data.

31:58.280 --> 32:00.600
Without my having to remind you.

32:00.760 --> 32:01.880
Of course.

32:02.040 --> 32:05.400
Let's schedule another call
for the end of the week.

32:05.560 --> 32:07.400
Jess, Tomas, can you stay on?

32:07.560 --> 32:09.960
-I'll sign off...
-No, no, hold on.

32:10.200 --> 32:12.240
Who's the man on the boat?

32:14.480 --> 32:16.600
He was helping me out.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.520
The seas can get pretty fierce
around here.

32:20.680 --> 32:21.880
Next time, you'll ask me.

32:22.120 --> 32:25.240
In the event of an accident,
there are liability issues,

32:25.400 --> 32:27.880
insurance issues for non-employees.

32:28.040 --> 32:30.000
I'm sorry, I should have checked.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.920
I've no problem with your
asking for someone's help.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.680
But when you go out again,
I expect everyone on board

32:37.840 --> 32:39.520
to be wearing life jackets.

32:39.680 --> 32:43.000
You know the rules
and I expect you to follow them.

32:43.160 --> 32:45.040
It won't happen again.

32:58.480 --> 33:01.160
Looks like you've come a long way
for nothing.

33:02.920 --> 33:05.760
I was hoping
the whales would stick to my schedule,

33:05.920 --> 33:07.960
but it seems they have other ideas.

33:10.080 --> 33:13.480
So how does an Italian
get named after an American state?

33:13.640 --> 33:14.960
Delaware?

33:15.120 --> 33:17.400
I like to think the state
was named after me.

33:17.640 --> 33:20.480
But you'd have to ask my father,
the American.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.760
He doesn't live in Delaware, does he?

33:23.880 --> 33:26.200
Last I heard, he was in Ohio.

33:32.280 --> 33:35.240
Tell me, how did you end up in Canada?

33:38.520 --> 33:40.440
Dishonorable discharge.

33:40.680 --> 33:42.960
-You were military?
-U.S. Navy.

33:43.640 --> 33:46.480
I was a trainer. Dolphins, mostly.

33:46.640 --> 33:48.960
We used them to clear mines
in the Persian Gulf

33:49.120 --> 33:51.360
and the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

33:51.520 --> 33:53.600
When they were retired
from active service,

33:53.760 --> 33:55.520
they didn't know what to do with them.

33:55.680 --> 33:58.160
They didn't think that
they were fit for the wild,

33:58.320 --> 34:01.200
said they were worried
they wouldn't survive,

34:01.360 --> 34:03.440
so they kept them in captivity.

34:03.920 --> 34:07.360
In pens. Too small to swim.

34:09.240 --> 34:11.240
Kept alive just to die.

34:13.120 --> 34:16.640
So I freed 'em. Got caught.
Got thrown out of the Navy.

34:16.800 --> 34:19.160
Kicked around for a few years.

34:19.320 --> 34:21.480
But a dishonorable discharge
in your record

34:21.640 --> 34:23.840
doesn't exactly
inspire confidence in people.

34:24.080 --> 34:28.400
Folks up here at the Institute
were a little more sympathetic.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.520
-Lizzie, they're back, whales are back.
-I know!

35:22.760 --> 35:24.880
The reports
are just starting to filter in.

35:25.040 --> 35:28.480
Not just here, there've been sightings
up and down the coast.

35:29.680 --> 35:32.120
Everywhere? At the same time?

35:32.280 --> 35:35.320
Listen, I gotta go.
I wanna be the first boat out there.

35:52.120 --> 35:53.680
Hey. Thank you.

35:54.280 --> 35:56.760
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

36:00.080 --> 36:01.200
Welcome aboard.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.440
-Thanks.
-Hi.

36:03.600 --> 36:04.800
Hey.

36:05.320 --> 36:07.400
Are you ready
to see one of these for real?

36:08.600 --> 36:10.160
There you go.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.920
Glad we stayed in town.

36:13.080 --> 36:15.080
Despite some protests.

36:16.200 --> 36:18.080
-I'm so excited.
-Me too.

36:18.240 --> 36:20.120
So, are you guys excited?

36:25.160 --> 36:26.840
Hey, glad you made it.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.720
I didn't think I would
get a chance to see them.

36:28.880 --> 36:29.920
You're not the only one.

36:30.160 --> 36:31.840
There are some ponchos
next to the life jackets.

36:32.080 --> 36:33.440
Thanks.

36:34.440 --> 36:36.960
Alright, landlubbers.
Everybody on board.

38:11.600 --> 38:13.800
There are pods of whales
which are residents

38:13.960 --> 38:15.680
to the Vancouver Island area.

38:15.840 --> 38:21.680
However, our most exciting visitors are
the whales that migrated south last year

38:21.840 --> 38:24.520
and are only arriving back just now.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.440
-Do you know what kind of whale this is?
-No.

39:07.680 --> 39:09.120
-Orca.
-Orca.

39:09.280 --> 39:12.280
Do you know that Brian uses this part
to navigate? Like on a ship.

39:12.520 --> 39:15.640
There's a rudder on a ship, and you turn
it like this, and it gives a direction.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.720
That is what this is for.

40:24.320 --> 40:25.680
Well, hello!

40:25.840 --> 40:27.920
Looks like we've got our first visitor!

40:36.280 --> 40:39.320
An adult humpback
can reach fifteen meters

40:39.560 --> 40:41.160
and weigh up to thirty tons.

40:41.400 --> 40:43.320
They're bigger than Godzilla.

40:43.480 --> 40:45.920
-Where is it?
-It's gone.

40:52.080 --> 40:53.680
Lizzie, come in!

41:06.080 --> 41:08.520
-Whoa! Where'd it go?
-Where did it go?

41:36.520 --> 41:38.440
Lady Wexham. This is Zodiac, come in.

41:38.680 --> 41:41.560
Lizzie, do you copy?
This is Zodiac, come in.

41:41.800 --> 41:44.800
Get ready. Here comes another soaking!

42:32.120 --> 42:33.120
My daughter!

42:37.360 --> 42:40.080
-Where's my daughter?
-This is Zodiac. We need help.

42:40.320 --> 42:42.520
I repeat: We need help now!

42:52.880 --> 42:54.440
Get out of the water!

42:54.960 --> 42:56.360
Alicia!

42:57.640 --> 42:59.760
-Mommy!
-Come on!

42:59.960 --> 43:00.960
Mommy!

43:02.760 --> 43:04.040
Come on!

43:04.200 --> 43:05.640
Grab my hand.

43:12.680 --> 43:14.280
Hurry up!

43:28.680 --> 43:30.640
-Mommy!
-Get on the boat!

43:38.960 --> 43:40.840
-Mommy!
-Get on the boat!

43:45.320 --> 43:46.320
Get up.

43:47.200 --> 43:48.880
-Hey!
-Lizzie!

43:50.000 --> 43:51.480
Please.

43:59.120 --> 44:01.000
Lizzie, come on!

44:01.240 --> 44:02.960
-Lizzie.
-Leon.

44:03.120 --> 44:04.600
Lizzie, no!
