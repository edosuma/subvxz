WEBVTT

00:01.602 --> 00:03.971
Hey...
Hey, Jackie boy, here's
your lunch right here, buddy.

00:04.038 --> 00:08.676
I was gonna put in watermelon
but, uh, it didn't look good,
so, uh, I ate it.

00:08.742 --> 00:11.212
And, uh,

00:11.279 --> 00:13.781
it ended up being good.
Really good actually.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.149
Uh, you got cherries.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.518
Hey, uh, Dad where's
my lacrosse uniform?

00:17.585 --> 00:18.719
Oh, I washed it.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.721
Okay, tell me you didn't
touch my sports bra.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.723
Started to,
then it kinda felt weird,

00:22.790 --> 00:26.394
so I picked it up
with salad tongs.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.463
I'll go get your stuff
for you, all right?

00:29.530 --> 00:31.432
I thought you were
going talk to him.

00:31.499 --> 00:34.168
You gotta tell him not
to pick me up from school.
He's driving me crazy.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.936
Okay, guys, I'm on it.
I got a plan.

00:36.003 --> 00:37.871
Okay, well, he comes
to every one of my
lacrosse practices.

00:37.938 --> 00:41.075
Not even the
coach does that.
I got it covered.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.111
Okay, just go to school.
Here you go.
Here's your stuff.

00:43.177 --> 00:45.979
Under items are in the
middle like a sandwich.
Like a sandwich.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.481
Not touching.
Not touching.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.550
Now see how it works?
All right, have a good day.

00:49.617 --> 00:53.121
Hey, hey, guys,
be leaders today, okay?
Be leaders!

00:53.187 --> 00:56.624
Hey, uh, Dad,
do you got a minute?
Yeah, what's up?

00:56.690 --> 00:58.592
Well, you know, I,
I just wanted to say,

00:58.659 --> 01:02.130
ever since Mom passed away,
you have been incredible.

01:02.196 --> 01:03.697
You know really involved.
Which is amazing.

01:03.764 --> 01:06.367
So, so great.
Sweet pea,
you gotta spit it out.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.336
I love ya,
but I got cookies baking.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.739
Okay, well,
I'm thinking maybe today,

01:11.805 --> 01:13.607
you don't go to
Sara's lacrosse practice.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.476
Or, you don't walk Jack
home from school, you know.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.411
He's got friends that
think it's a little weird.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.180
What?
I, I don't walk with him.

01:19.247 --> 01:21.215
I'm back like 25, 30 yards.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.252
Yeah, that's the weird part.

01:24.318 --> 01:27.221
Hey, look, I gotta make sure
he gets home safe.
It's is my job, all right?

01:27.288 --> 01:30.057
Okay, well, maybe you could
just take a little vacation
from your job.

01:30.124 --> 01:31.892
You know what?
By the way,
I was just thinking that

01:31.959 --> 01:33.694
we should all take a
vacation to Hershey Park.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.396
And I'm thinking
this weekend.
The whole family.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.565
Oh, wow, fun.
Yes!

01:37.631 --> 01:42.270
This, this is gonna be my
first trip as a full-fledged
member of the Gable family.

01:43.070 --> 01:46.440
But we have other plans.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.576
And then we can hit
Amish country?
How cool is that.

01:48.642 --> 01:54.515
"Oh, look at me, I'm Amish.
I'm going to build a barn
and you churn the butter."

01:54.582 --> 01:56.384
I don't know how
they sound like but...

01:57.551 --> 01:58.686
Hey, hey.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.421
Hey, Vanessa.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.156
What are you doing here?

02:02.223 --> 02:05.993
Oh, I was just in the
neighborhood, thought
I'd swing by, catch up.

02:06.059 --> 02:08.596
What?
Okay, I need a favor.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.699
You know how after
I retired I started
taking security gigs,

02:11.765 --> 02:14.067
well today I need
a partner just for a one day.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.270
No can do. No.
I'm a full-time dad now,
all right?

02:16.337 --> 02:18.005
No, Dad...
The kids depend on me.

02:18.071 --> 02:21.409
It's just one day.
Chale and I can
take care of the kids.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.844
Okay, there you go.
Come on, I need you.

02:23.911 --> 02:27.581
Just find somebody else,
all right?
I can't. I need the best.

02:30.951 --> 02:34.388
Finally, we get to the truth.

02:34.455 --> 02:38.192
All right, look, I guess
Superman could fly
one more time, you know.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.660
Mm-hmm.
That would be great.

02:39.727 --> 02:42.663
Okay. I'm just gonna
put on my cape.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.599
And by cape, I mean
some fresh sweats,

02:45.666 --> 02:47.635
because Superman
likes to keep it loose
in the caboose,

02:47.701 --> 02:49.603
you know what
I'm talking about.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.475
Oh, thank you.
That was perfect.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.710
He's been so obsessed
with taking care of us

02:56.777 --> 02:58.679
that he forgets he's
supposed to have a life too.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.281
I know.
And every time I bring it up,

03:00.348 --> 03:01.982
he just gives me
the tough guy routine.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.484
So I just stick
with the usual,
you know, you're fat,

03:03.551 --> 03:05.686
you're dumb, you're useless.

03:05.753 --> 03:09.089
And he really needs that
right now. Thank you.

03:09.156 --> 03:11.091
I do what I can.

03:11.158 --> 03:12.660
Hurry up, idiot!

03:13.827 --> 03:18.966
* I am not your
ordinary guy *

03:19.032 --> 03:21.869
Wait a second.
We gotta go back, they didn't
put onions on my burger.

03:21.935 --> 03:24.238
We're not going back.
Deal with it.

03:26.574 --> 03:29.810
Did you get
onions on yours?
Yes.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.546
Then obviously
you have my burger.
Can you trade with me?

03:32.613 --> 03:35.215
Oh! Fine, fine.
You big baby. Here.
Thank you.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.187
(STUTTERS)

03:40.254 --> 03:41.789
What is that?
What is that?

03:41.855 --> 03:43.757
I can't believe,
I don't know. Lipstick?

03:43.824 --> 03:45.593
Lipstick!
I want mine back.

03:45.659 --> 03:48.396
Oh! Fine, fine.
Listen, take it back.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.899
Can I just get the
onions off yours?

03:51.965 --> 03:53.734
I just want the onions.
Just your onions.
You're sick, you know.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.969
Just onions.
That's all it is.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.805
So what's the name of this
company we're working for?

03:57.871 --> 04:00.874
Golden Phoenix Security.
It's a new company. Why?

04:00.941 --> 04:03.511
(DEEP BREATH) I'm just saying.
You know, we're serving
divorce papers.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.979
It's kind of low-rent.
(LIGHT GRUNTS)

04:06.046 --> 04:07.815
They're paying us.

04:07.881 --> 04:10.451
Two people to hand
a guy a piece of paper.
It's not that hard.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.286
He's slippery, okay?

04:12.353 --> 04:14.254
He knows we're coming.

04:14.322 --> 04:16.156
I tried twice,
he got away from me.

04:16.223 --> 04:17.891
You tried twice?

04:17.958 --> 04:19.527
(LAUGHS)

04:19.593 --> 04:23.964
Now I know why you had to
bring in the big man.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.567
Wait a second,
is that him over there?
Yeah, okay. That's him.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.268
That's the guy, right?
He's jogging.
Yeah, yeah.

04:28.336 --> 04:29.870
Okay, here's the plan.
I'm gonna go around
the back...

04:29.937 --> 04:31.972
New plan,
let the big man roll.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.944
It's good to stretch, right?

04:37.010 --> 04:38.278
Yeah.

04:38.346 --> 04:41.114
Hey, aren't you
Anthony Baer?

04:41.181 --> 04:43.016
You'll never take me alive!

04:43.083 --> 04:44.585
I don't wanna take you alive.
I'm just gonna give you
an envelope.

04:44.652 --> 04:45.886
That's all I'm gonna do.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.321
Tell my wife I'm
not getting divorced.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.189
A man can love two women!

04:49.256 --> 04:50.758
He's fast.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.993
Get back here. Hey, hey!
I'm just trying to give you...

04:53.060 --> 04:55.729
Hey, kid, give me the bike!
Retired police business!

04:55.796 --> 04:57.431
Hey, the steering's jacked!
It doesn't matter, kid.

04:57.498 --> 05:00.368
I've been riding
my whole life, all right?
I got this.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.474
The steering is jacked, man.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.642
The steering is jacked!

05:14.014 --> 05:15.449
(CRASHING)

05:18.118 --> 05:19.787
Yeah.
What's up?

05:20.754 --> 05:22.390
You okay there, Superman?

05:22.456 --> 05:24.692
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
Just a little scrape
on the arm.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.627
What's up?
I'm talking about your eyes.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.028
Your pupils
are different sizes.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.364
Oh, that's just the
cop juices flowing.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.600
You look a little
concussion-y.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.469
Fired up.
I can't believe he got away.

05:35.536 --> 05:38.138
And he moved out
of his apartment,
so now we've got nothing.

05:38.205 --> 05:40.474
No, no, I saw something
on his shirt, okay.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.075
He had a, my God.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.578
You know what it said,
it said "Staff."
Oh, that's great.

05:44.645 --> 05:48.549
Now we know he works
somewhere on the planet.

05:48.616 --> 05:52.185
There was an emblem be,
underneath it. It was like
a... (STUTTERS)

05:52.252 --> 05:54.822
I'm telling you it was
a baseball, or like
a ball of yarn,

05:54.888 --> 05:56.657
or like scoops,
scoops of ice cream.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.459
Tomorrow, bright and early,
let's meet up at that diner...

05:58.526 --> 05:59.827
What? Tomorrow?

05:59.893 --> 06:01.495
Yeah.
No, no, no.
This was a one-day gig.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.397
Oh, okay,
so Superman's a quitter?

06:03.464 --> 06:06.333
No, Superman's got
a lot on his plate.
I gotta make banana bread...

06:06.400 --> 06:09.970
Oh, Superman's gotta get
bananas, and eggs, and yea,

06:10.037 --> 06:11.905
do you make yeast or
do you like...
I'm gonna go.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.674
I'm gonna go, yeah.
You buy yeast?

06:13.741 --> 06:16.677
Where would you go to,
where do you go to buy yeast?

06:20.548 --> 06:22.115
(CLEARS THROAT)

06:22.182 --> 06:23.551
Oh, boy.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.457
Hey, uh, Dad.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.024
There's somebody
here to see you.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.225
What? Who?

06:32.292 --> 06:33.461
Come on.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.128
All right.
Come on.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.899
(EXCITED CHATTER)
What's up, dog?

06:38.966 --> 06:41.101
What are you guys doing here?
We're here to watch the game.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.336
Yeah. You never come
to Enzo's anymore,

06:43.403 --> 06:45.238
so we brought Enzo's to you.
(LAUGHS)

06:45.305 --> 06:48.108
Yeah. Along with a little
message from Enzo himself,

06:48.175 --> 06:51.512
"Profits are dipping,
please come back soon."

06:51.579 --> 06:55.516
Uh, it was very sweet
of you guys, but I got a
lot of things going on.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.350
I can't, I can't do it.
What are you cooking?

06:57.417 --> 07:00.654
Oh, this is a sports bra.
Sorry.

07:00.721 --> 07:03.591
Actually, Dad,
we can handle the laundry.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.626
Yeah, but,
I gotta make a banana bread.

07:05.693 --> 07:08.562
No, we already made it.
And by we she means...

07:09.196 --> 07:10.564
We.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.102
All right, I guess
I'm watching the game.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.870
Yeah!
Yeah!

07:16.937 --> 07:19.640
I heard through
the grapevine you did
a gig with Cellucci.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.775
Oh, yeah, it was,
uh, it was an easy one.

07:21.842 --> 07:24.277
One day, no big deal,
you know, just serving papers.

07:24.344 --> 07:27.915
Should've been in and out,
but of course,
Cellucci blew it.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.884
She's usually pretty good.
Yeah, not yesterday
she wasn't.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.186
Well, what happened
to your arm?

07:33.253 --> 07:36.089
Oh, I was, uh,
I was out raking leaves.

07:36.156 --> 07:39.226
And the, uh, the rake
just got away from me.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.062
The rake did that?

07:42.129 --> 07:44.164
Either way,
it's good that you're
gettin' back out there.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.866
You know, I gotta say,
it was kind of fun.

07:45.933 --> 07:49.737
I'm sorry, I'm a little fuzzy
on this rake thing.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.371
How does a
rake hurt you there?

07:51.438 --> 07:53.140
Just leave it alone, guy.
Guy?

07:53.206 --> 07:56.510
I'm just working it
out through my head.
It doesn't add up.

07:56.577 --> 07:59.913
Kyle, we're talking
about how great it is
that your brother,

07:59.980 --> 08:02.550
the widower,
is getting back on his feet.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.051
Okay, fine.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.954
(LIGHT CHUCKLES)
I'll work it out
on my own.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.222
So, uh, you gonna
do more gigs?

08:09.289 --> 08:12.425
I don't know, if Cellucci
had me something for me,
I would do it, you know.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.794
Oh, no.
Why wait for Cellucci?

08:13.861 --> 08:15.495
Go down there
and get your own gigs.

08:15.563 --> 08:18.732
Yeah. You're a 20-year vet,
you're still in good shape.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.568
GOODY: Yeah.
That's true.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.138
Yeah, maybe I will.
Maybe I will.

08:25.205 --> 08:27.374
Yeah. There you go!
That's great!

08:27.440 --> 08:31.612
Okay. Unless someone
actually threw
a rake at you...

08:31.679 --> 08:33.480
it just doesn't add up.

08:33.547 --> 08:34.815
BOTH: Guy!

08:36.817 --> 08:39.152
Excuse me, is this, uh,
Golden Phoenix Security?

08:39.219 --> 08:43.390
Yes, it is.
Oh, well, in that case you
got yourself a problem.

08:43.456 --> 08:46.159
I don't work here.
(LAUGHS)

08:46.226 --> 08:48.996
Kevin Gable, Nassau police,
20-year vet.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.463
I just did a gig
with you guys.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.732
I worked with, uh,
Vanessa Cellucci.

08:51.799 --> 08:54.301
Oh, you worked for Vanessa?
No.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.236
(LAUGHS)
Not for. With.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.772
She's a great gal, though,
great gal. She really is.
She's fantastic.

08:58.839 --> 09:01.108
You know what it is,
it's kind of like a level
thing though.

09:01.174 --> 09:04.111
I'm like more Seal Team Six,
you know, she's,

09:04.177 --> 09:07.615
she's kind of like
Seal Team Two,
Two and a half in that area.

09:07.681 --> 09:10.751
If she's even Seal Team,
you know. I'm not even
sure about that.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.886
She might be the
guy on the aircraft
carrier with the,

09:12.953 --> 09:15.422
the flashlights,
"Hey, park the plane
over here."

09:15.488 --> 09:16.990
(LAUGHS)

09:17.057 --> 09:19.259
(SIGHS)
Anyway, here's my rezzy.
Enjoy that.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.629
Great. I'll, uh,
give it to the owner.

09:21.695 --> 09:24.598
Thank you. That's,
that's very nice of you.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.204
What's up, girl?

09:32.906 --> 09:37.110
It's my company, dummy.
Greg's my IT guy.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.680
Hey. Thanks for the
heads up, Greggy.

09:44.484 --> 09:46.353
I can't believe you.

09:46.419 --> 09:50.257
I get you a job and your
first instinct is to throw me
under the bus.

09:50.323 --> 09:53.794
I didn't throw you
under the bus, I was
promoting myself by

09:53.861 --> 09:56.630
pointing out that
I'm slightly better than you.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.766
You are unbelievable.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.033
Why are you hiding
this from me?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.702
You don't tell me that
you have your company?

10:01.769 --> 10:04.437
Because your fat ego
won't allow you to
take the job.

10:04.504 --> 10:07.074
I don't have an ego.
I have no problem
working for you.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.676
Oh, really?

10:08.742 --> 10:11.712
(IMITATING KEVIN)
I'm Seal Team Six,
and she's Seal Team Two!

10:11.779 --> 10:13.246
(GRUNTING)

10:18.518 --> 10:22.155
Ain't nothing wrong
with Seal Team Two.
Those kids work hard, okay?

10:22.222 --> 10:24.391
And by the way,
don't try to turn this
around on me.

10:24.457 --> 10:28.261
You're the one who lied.
I didn't lie to you.
We were trying to help you.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.429
We?

10:29.496 --> 10:31.031
No, I meant I,
I meant me.

10:31.098 --> 10:34.902
I was trying to help you
get back out into the world.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.938
Back into the world?
That's what Kendra...

10:39.372 --> 10:42.175
Wait a second,
did Kendra put you up
to this?

10:42.242 --> 10:44.244
Okay.
Please don't be mad at her.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.747
She was worried about you,
she wanted me to throw you

10:46.814 --> 10:48.816
a job just to
get you going again.

10:48.882 --> 10:52.352
Oh, so this is
a pity job?
No. Not pity.

10:52.419 --> 10:55.355
We just felt sorry for you.

10:56.623 --> 10:59.126
That's the
definition of pity!

10:59.192 --> 11:00.861
You know what?
I'm out here, okay?

11:00.928 --> 11:03.931
And by the way, the name
you chose Golden Phoenix?

11:03.997 --> 11:05.766
It sounds like a
Chinese restaurant.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.567
What!
Yeah.

11:07.634 --> 11:13.606
Excuse me, it's a bird
rising up from the
ashes into goldness.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.108
Mm.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.677
I'm getting
pork-fried rice.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.583
Oh, hey, Dad.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.418
Kendra.
How are you?

11:25.485 --> 11:27.387
Oh, I'm pretty good.

11:27.454 --> 11:30.023
I was thinking maybe tonight,
uh, I don't know, all of us
get together

11:30.090 --> 11:31.524
maybe watch a movie or
something after dinner?

11:31.591 --> 11:33.260
Yeah, that sounds good.
What do you want to watch?

11:33.326 --> 11:35.763
Maybe that new one
with Brad Pitt-y!

11:37.130 --> 11:38.165
What?

11:38.231 --> 11:40.367
Vanessa told me
about your plan, okay?

11:40.433 --> 11:43.303
And let me tell you something,
I don't want anybody
to pity me.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.738
Oh. Pity.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.506
Brad Pity.

11:46.573 --> 11:49.743
Wow, that was a long walk
around the block.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.545
Effective walk.

11:52.612 --> 11:56.850
(SCOFFS) Okay, so, Dad,
what are you so upset about?

11:56.917 --> 11:58.919
(SCOFFS) Why would you go
behind my back?

11:58.986 --> 12:02.856
Well, because, you know,
all you've done for the past
year is take care of us.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.191
Yeah, it's been a tough year.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.994
Yeah, I know,
but we're okay, you know.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.962
And now you need to do
something for yourself.

12:09.029 --> 12:13.500
Mom would want you to
go back to work, and see
your friends, and shave.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.406
You don't,
you don't like the...
Nobody does.

12:19.472 --> 12:23.310
That's 'cause it's not done.
Wait till I go full ZZ Top
on your ass.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.314
It's gonna be here.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.150
(LAUGHTER)

12:30.217 --> 12:32.886
Oh!
Look who's back at Enzo's.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.322
Oh, big changes, boys.

12:35.388 --> 12:38.591
Looks like K.G's getting
back in the work force.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.861
Yeah! Now that's what
I'm talking about.
KEVIN: Mm-hmm.

12:40.928 --> 12:43.997
So I guess the old rake
injury cleared up?

12:45.532 --> 12:46.867
It's gettin' there.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.002
So give us the details.
Who you working for?

12:49.069 --> 12:51.504
Well, here's where I drop
the big bomb. Nobody.

12:51.571 --> 12:55.843
That's right.
You're looking at the founder
and of Gable Security,

12:55.909 --> 12:59.947
"Where In Security
is a Good Thing."

13:01.181 --> 13:02.816
How's insecurity
a good thing?

13:02.883 --> 13:04.517
No, no, no, no.

13:04.584 --> 13:08.155
It's not
"insecurity." It's "In,"
new word, "Security."

13:08.221 --> 13:11.825
And you're in security.
You get like a hug,
like a muffin, you know.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.526
Like you're in it.
You're warm.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.128
I like it.
Right.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.297
That's why I love
your fat face, Mott.
I love it.

13:18.999 --> 13:21.534
I also like that you're
starting your own business.
KEVIN: Right?

13:21.601 --> 13:23.703
Yeah, man, just,
just like Vanessa did.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.372
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.574
I had this idea
years ago, okay?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.309
Vanessa stole it from me.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.711
I don't know, man.
I mean, a lot of cops
have that idea.

13:31.778 --> 13:33.446
I know I did.
Me too.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.916
Me too, and I'm a fireman.

13:35.983 --> 13:39.786
It doesn't matter. I'm gonna
rocket past the competition,
including Cellucci.

13:39.853 --> 13:42.322
I'm going to be like that,
uh, that ride at Funland,

13:42.389 --> 13:44.157
what was the one that
you threw up on, Mott?
The Catapult?

13:44.224 --> 13:45.692
Catapult!
I'm gonna be like
the catapult.

13:45.758 --> 13:49.362
I'm gonna catapult past...
Wait a second, that's it.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.965
The catapult.
That was the emblem
on the guy's shirt.

13:52.032 --> 13:54.034
Wait, what are we
talking about?

13:54.101 --> 13:56.870
When Vanessa and I were
trying to serve the guy
papers, he had a catapult...

13:56.937 --> 13:58.371
He must work at Funland.

13:58.438 --> 14:02.542
I gotta go.
This, this makes sense.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.744
I'll tell ya what
doesn't make sense.

14:04.811 --> 14:06.179
That rake story.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.886
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

14:12.953 --> 14:14.754
VANESSA: Hello.
Hey, Vanessa,

14:14.821 --> 14:18.358
well you'll never guess
who just trapped himself
an Anthony Baer.

14:18.425 --> 14:19.659
That's right.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.594
Figured it out.
Mm-hmm.
You did?

14:21.661 --> 14:24.464
So if you wanna apologize,
well you know where he's at.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.233
(SCOFFS)
I don't need you too.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.668
I'm already here.
No, you're not.

14:28.735 --> 14:32.205
Uh, I can see you.
You're wearing a t-shirt
with your IQ on it.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.176
No, no.
No, I'm not.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.912
Okay, now you're looking
around like a moron.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.048
(STUTTERS)
Where are you?

14:41.114 --> 14:42.782
Right behind you.

14:42.849 --> 14:45.152
I knew you were there.
I just, I was just
setting you up.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.187
It's cool, right?
We got him.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.759
So how'd you figure out
he worked here?

14:52.825 --> 14:55.628
I was at Enzo's and it hit
me like a flash of insight.

14:55.695 --> 14:58.165
You know how my brain's like,
it's always working and it
can't be explained?

14:58.231 --> 15:00.733
You know, like, once someone
gets hit in the head with
a baseball

15:00.800 --> 15:03.736
"Hey, I can play
the ukulele." You know,
they just crank it out.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.605
That's how it happened.
Oh.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.941
And how'd you
figure it out?
Called his wife.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.242
All right.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.744
Not as flashy,
it got you here though.

15:11.811 --> 15:14.281
What's with the getup?
Well, he knows
what I look like.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.149
You look like the Unabomber.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.485
Okay. You can go.
And I got this.

15:18.551 --> 15:21.021
No. No. Kevin Gable
doesn't just give up.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.123
He finishes the job.
You know what?

15:23.190 --> 15:25.225
That's, that's actually
a good slogan for
my new business.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.094
What are you
talking about?
Oh, you didn't hear?

15:27.160 --> 15:29.829
I started
a new security company.
Here's my, uh, business card.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.631
Check it out.
Okay.

15:31.698 --> 15:34.067
This is a scrap of paper.
'Cause the real ones
aren't in yet.

15:34.134 --> 15:38.371
It's gonna take some time
'cause I'm getting
Van Halen lettering.

15:38.438 --> 15:42.475
"Gable Security.
Where In Security
is a Good Thing."

15:42.542 --> 15:44.277
Okay, what does
that even mean?
No, no, no.

15:44.344 --> 15:47.114
It's "In," new word,
"Security." Like you're in,

15:47.180 --> 15:50.683
like you're embraced
in the arms of security.
It's like hugging you.

15:50.750 --> 15:54.221
Still don't get it.
Okay, it doesn't matter.
It's gonna be huge, thank you.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.123
Okay. Well,
good luck with that.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.458
Hey, you know what,
I'm gonna do you a solid.
You need a location?

15:58.525 --> 16:03.896
You can have mine and I will
let the landlord know to
hound you for the back rent.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.465
Back rent?
Yes.

16:05.532 --> 16:08.435
That's what it's called
when you can't pay
the actual rent.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.237
I didn't know you were
doing that bad.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.771
It's okay.
I'll work it out.

16:11.838 --> 16:14.674
But it's not easy to start
a business at thirty-nine.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.143
Shut up.

16:19.512 --> 16:22.582
At least you're out there
trying something new,
you know.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.218
I've been living in a
cocoon since Donna.

16:25.285 --> 16:28.555
Kids just keep trying
to push me back out
into the work force.

16:28.621 --> 16:31.791
But I gotta tell you,
I don't know if I'm,
if I'm ready.

16:31.858 --> 16:34.294
Look, you lost your wife.

16:34.361 --> 16:37.530
It'd take anybody time
to crawl out of that.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.032
Yeah, I guess.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.634
All right,
so what you wanna do?
Okay, how about this?

16:41.701 --> 16:43.536
When you're,
when you're getting
strapped in,

16:43.603 --> 16:45.905
I'll come up behind and
serve him the papers.

16:45.972 --> 16:47.474
(SHRIEKING)

16:49.976 --> 16:52.579
You want me to get on
the actual ride and do that?

16:52.645 --> 16:55.048
Um...

16:55.115 --> 16:58.585
Yeah, I mean,
full disclosure,
I had a bag of zeppolis.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.621
I ate a lot of it, so,
I don't know if it's
the smartest move.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.156
But, I, you know...

17:03.223 --> 17:04.991
Hey, you know
what we could do?
What?

17:05.058 --> 17:07.794
Remember on patrol
in the parking lot in
Mulcahey's that night?

17:07.860 --> 17:10.197
Yes, with the guy who
was trying to break into
the convertible.

17:10.263 --> 17:11.731
And we did the thing...
Yeah, let's do that.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.067
I love it. Let's go.
Do you like it? All right.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.203
I wanna go next.

17:16.269 --> 17:18.105
Let me on this thing.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.906
Who, whoa, whoa,
another drunk one. No.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.142
Ma'am get...
I wanna get on the ride!

17:22.209 --> 17:25.312
Oh, I got it.
I'm undercover park
security, I'll take her out.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.147
Ma'am, you had too much.
I'm totally good.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.116
I'm gonna write up the report,
give me your name
one more time.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.617
Anthony Baer.
Thank you.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.785
Here you go.
You've been served,
Anthony.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.354
Son of a...

17:34.421 --> 17:35.755
(LAUGHS)

17:35.822 --> 17:37.757
We did it.

17:37.824 --> 17:41.060
Well, I hate to
actually admit it,
but we pulled it off.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.962
That was pretty good.
Right?

17:43.029 --> 17:45.265
And how happy are you now
that you don't have to get
on that ride?

17:45.332 --> 17:47.100
You were so scared.

17:47.167 --> 17:50.403
I wasn't scared.
It's okay if you are.

17:50.470 --> 17:53.473
You were the one who
was scared. You're scared of
the whole business thing.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.275
Okay, fine.
Can we just admit it that

17:55.342 --> 17:59.612
we're both scared
a little bit of the,
the ride, life change?

17:59.679 --> 18:02.782
No, I'm not admitting
anything. I'll prove it
to you right now.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.084
So how do you feel?

18:05.152 --> 18:07.120
It's all right.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.422
As a matter of fact
if this line wasn't so long,
I'd ride this thing twice.

18:09.489 --> 18:10.990
Okay, well,
I would ride it five times.

18:11.057 --> 18:13.526
I will ride it 116 times.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.829
And understand this,
I thrive in this environment.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.765
(SHRIEKING)

18:23.603 --> 18:25.872
(INDISTINCT MUMBLING)
Yeah.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.844
(GRUNTS)

18:31.911 --> 18:33.846
Fun.
Good, we're good.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.192
(SHRIEKING)

18:47.460 --> 18:49.962
You're good, right? Fun!
Yeah.

18:50.029 --> 18:51.298
(LAUGHTER)

18:55.702 --> 18:58.137
I'm so glad you
guys got this video.

18:58.205 --> 18:59.872
How many times
did you pass out?

18:59.939 --> 19:03.376
I didn't pass out.
I was so bored I
actually fell asleep.

19:03.443 --> 19:07.314
You know, the physics
of that are actually
quite fascinating.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.781
See, the surge
of adrenaline...

19:08.848 --> 19:10.383
Stop ruining it.

19:12.785 --> 19:16.122
So you guys are doing this?
You're going into business
together?

19:16.189 --> 19:18.057
We're thinking about it.
Yes.

19:18.124 --> 19:21.060
Nothing's been decided.
Our brains got pretty
rocked on that thing.

19:21.127 --> 19:22.195
(LIGHT CHUCKLES)

19:22.262 --> 19:23.930
Well, our vote is yes.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.233
In fact, I'm gonna
go open some wine
so we can celebrate.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.767
Please.

19:32.239 --> 19:37.210
Hey, I just wanted to
say thanks for doing
all this, you know.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.778
But, I'm still the Dad,
all right.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.880
I'm the one supposed to be
taking care of all you kids.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.850
I know. But that doesn't mean
we can't look out for
you sometimes.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.151
Thank you.

19:45.218 --> 19:46.386
(LAUGHTER)

19:46.453 --> 19:48.755
See that?
That I like seeing.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.156
Yeah, me too.

19:50.223 --> 19:54.827
Okay, just walk me
through this,
and I swear I'll let it go.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.867
Tell me what
we're doing again?

20:00.933 --> 20:02.769
Insurance fraud thing.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.472
We just gotta get a shot
of this old lady without
her back brace on.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.639
Oh!

20:06.706 --> 20:08.841
Just got a shot of her
without anything on.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.977
Oh, man.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.246
I literally can't tell if
that's her front or her back.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.481
I can't look at this.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.716
Oh! Yeah, okay,
let's take a break.

20:16.783 --> 20:19.185
Let's eat something.
I can't eat right now.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.821
I have no appetite.
I gotta wait for
this to clear.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.257
Please, for a sec,
all right.
Yeah. Good.

20:26.092 --> 20:27.594
You gotta be kiddin' me.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.397
Can you check.
Do you have mayo in yours?
Yeah.

20:31.664 --> 20:34.267
I'm supposed to have
mayo on mine.
Sorry.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.835
Deal with it.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.904
Can you, can you,
can you just switch
with me?

20:37.970 --> 20:40.773
I am not going through
this with you every time!

20:43.376 --> 20:45.578
I'm just asking you
to take the...

20:48.948 --> 20:51.618
Was that so difficult?
I don't think it was.

20:51.684 --> 20:52.785
Okay.

20:56.122 --> 20:59.058
* Don't want no sweet perfume

20:59.125 --> 21:02.462
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move

21:02.529 --> 21:04.230
* Do, do, do, do, do

21:04.297 --> 21:06.265
* Do, do, do, do

21:06.333 --> 21:09.802
* Oh, yeah

21:09.869 --> 21:13.072
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes

21:13.139 --> 21:15.375
* I just don't want no...
