00:12.637 --> 00:15.974
[bugs chirring]

00:35.118 --> 00:38.663
[Bruce] Marty Byrde,
you're my best friend. I love you. I do.

00:38.747 --> 00:41.166
But you're living
a tragically subdued life.

00:41.708 --> 00:42.667
[Marty] Mm-hmm.

00:42.751 --> 00:45.170
And how is it--
How is it we make the same bank,

00:45.253 --> 00:47.756
and yet I could see my place
in Trump Tower from here

00:47.839 --> 00:50.508
and you're driving a ten-year-old
Camry with cloth fucking seats?

00:50.592 --> 00:54.971
Nothing wrong with that Camry,
and-- and I do just fine sex-wise.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.014
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

00:56.097 --> 01:00.602
Really? Says the man watching DIY porn
in his office with clients present.

01:01.394 --> 01:02.395
[Bruce] Wow.

01:07.108 --> 01:09.235
[Liz] Marty, what do you think?
Don't you love it?

01:09.319 --> 01:10.570
[Marty] It's nice. Very nice.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.113
-[Bruce] It's "nice"?!
-[Marty] Yeah.

01:12.197 --> 01:15.116
Fuckin’ nice?
I’m in that corner, you’re in that corner.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.368
Twenty people working for us.
Boom, boom, boom.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.080
-Two receptionists.
-What kind of windows are these?

01:20.163 --> 01:22.082
-The kind you see through.
-[Liz] I dunno.

01:22.665 --> 01:24.793
I mean, this is southern facing, right?
I mean…

01:24.876 --> 01:26.461
Depending on their performance rating,

01:26.544 --> 01:29.756
the cooling bill would be 
15, 20% higher in summer.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.466
[Marty] Something to consider.

01:31.549 --> 01:34.594
[clock continues ticking]

01:37.555 --> 01:39.557
[children chattering in distance]

[dialing]

01:44.229 --> 01:45.730
[line ringing]

01:45.814 --> 01:48.858
This is Bruce Liddell. Leave me
a message, and I'll call you back.

01:48.942 --> 01:49.859
[beeps]

01:49.943 --> 01:52.237
Hey, Bruce. Marty.

01:52.737 --> 01:56.032
Buddy, let's-- let's pull the trigger
on that office. Okay?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.368
Let's-- Let's… Let's lock that down.

01:58.451 --> 02:02.622
I-- I do think it would be nice to get
a look at some utility comps from Liz

02:02.705 --> 02:06.417
if she can get her hands on some,
but I do think that we should do it.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.129
You know, let's do it. Um…

02:10.421 --> 02:13.508
The parking, however,
is something that we didn't talk about.

02:13.591 --> 02:16.094
And I'm sure that the city
is going to want their 1%.

02:16.177 --> 02:18.221
But-- But I do-- I do think
that-- that we should…

02:18.304 --> 02:20.598
We should--
we should think hard about this.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.308
Definitely. And…

02:23.268 --> 02:25.562
you know, we'll review
the lease agreement,

02:25.645 --> 02:28.106
we'll take another walk through,
and… and, um…

02:30.024 --> 02:33.486
You know, there--
there is the possibility that

02:34.112 --> 02:37.490
there's another space
that we might like better. Uh…

02:38.491 --> 02:40.201
But, um…

02:40.869 --> 02:43.037
Uh, well, so I guess…

02:44.080 --> 02:46.416
don't tell Liz
that we're going to take it.

02:46.499 --> 02:49.460
Just tell her that you and I are gonna
talk about it face-to-face.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.796
We're gonna hash it all out
on Monday. All right?

02:53.298 --> 02:54.382
All right. Bye.

02:54.883 --> 02:55.800
[phone beeps off]

02:55.884 --> 02:59.637
[clock resumes ticking]

[ominous music playing]

03:16.070 --> 03:17.739
[outbound message whooshes]

03:18.489 --> 03:19.490
Love you.

03:21.993 --> 03:22.911
Love you too.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.252
[sinister music playing]

03:36.132 --> 03:37.342
[trailer door slams]

03:39.260 --> 03:40.762
We just take whatever we can fit.

03:40.845 --> 03:43.932
But otherwise we can just buy new shit
when we get where we're goin'.

03:44.891 --> 03:45.767
Uh-huh.

03:46.267 --> 03:47.602
Uh-huh. What're you doing?

03:47.685 --> 03:50.730
Get your guitar and your hoodie
with the-- the linin' in it.

03:50.813 --> 03:52.440
Uh, I gotta talk to you.

03:53.107 --> 03:53.942
[Ruth] What?

03:54.859 --> 03:56.110
[Wyatt sniffling]

03:56.861 --> 03:58.446
I'm gonna marry Darlene.

04:01.824 --> 04:03.701
-[Wyatt chuckles]
-[Ruth scoffs]

04:05.370 --> 04:06.788
Are you fuckin' with me?

04:13.795 --> 04:15.505
Are you not fuckin' with me?

04:15.588 --> 04:21.010
If-- If I don't do it,
then Zeke's gonna end up in a foster home.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.765
I'm sorry. It's for the baby.

04:28.142 --> 04:31.521
Then take the damn baby.
You want me to go get the fuckin' baby?!

04:31.604 --> 04:33.898
-I'll go grab that damn baby right now!
-Ruth!

04:33.982 --> 04:35.692
No, you're not fucking doing this!

04:36.192 --> 04:37.902
Well, you can't tell me what to do.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.405
The fuck I can't.
She killed the head of the KC Mob

04:40.488 --> 04:42.031
and that's gonna come back on her.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.117
And if you stay,
that'll come back on you too.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.828
No one knows that she did that
aside from you and me.

04:46.911 --> 04:48.204
No, I know that.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.332
All I'm saying is that she's dangerous.

04:52.667 --> 04:53.876
She loves me, Ruth.

04:54.419 --> 04:55.378
I love you.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.675
[quavering] I-- I don't want to go.

05:03.177 --> 05:05.221
[chuckles] I-- I never wanted to go.

05:11.936 --> 05:13.187
Then why'd you say it?

05:13.771 --> 05:14.605
I don't know.

05:24.907 --> 05:25.950
Fuck you!

05:26.451 --> 05:27.994
You're a fucking child!

05:28.077 --> 05:30.038
And you're not marrying Darlene Snell!

05:30.121 --> 05:33.916
-I'm not doing this with you.
-No, you-- you promised to come with me.

05:34.000 --> 05:34.876
You know what?

05:35.418 --> 05:37.128
I'm sorry. Okay?

05:38.379 --> 05:39.964
I'm sorry that you're sad.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.468
I'm sorry that your boyfriend died.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.013
And I'm sorry that you're lonely.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.141
Okay? But I love her.

05:51.726 --> 05:52.935
And I'm gonna marry her.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.687
[quavering] No, j-just wait a minute.

05:54.771 --> 05:57.565
A goddamn minute.
Just wait one fuckin' second.

06:01.235 --> 06:03.613
[shuddered breathing]

06:05.365 --> 06:07.825
Can-- Can I at least come to the wedding?

06:10.119 --> 06:12.455
[melancholy music playing]

06:12.538 --> 06:14.540
[engine turns over]

06:31.015 --> 06:33.017
[crow squawks]

06:34.102 --> 06:38.481
[crow continues squawking]

06:40.733 --> 06:45.488
[Jim] Omar Navarro has ceded power
to his nephew Javier Emilio Elizondro.

06:46.155 --> 06:50.701
In exchange for freedom of mobility
and promise of immunity,

06:50.785 --> 06:55.540
Mr. Navarro has provided information
necessary not only to apprehend Elizondro,

06:55.623 --> 06:58.793
but also to neutralize
the Navarro Cartel entirely--

06:58.876 --> 07:00.795
I'm gonna stop you right there.

07:01.712 --> 07:04.882
The Bureau has had time
to reflect on the situation,

07:05.842 --> 07:08.177
and we have decided
that you will be staying on

07:08.261 --> 07:10.596
as head of the cartel
for the next five years.

07:11.180 --> 07:15.226
Now, your client will provide
intelligence when called upon,

07:15.309 --> 07:18.729
and we will continue to coordinate
with him on the monetary seizures.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.440
After five years,

07:20.940 --> 07:23.443
we can grant your client
immunity from prosecution

07:23.526 --> 07:25.111
in the United States.

07:25.194 --> 07:26.988
Can grant immunity.

07:27.071 --> 07:29.824
That's a very interesting choice of words.

07:30.658 --> 07:33.161
We're gonna stop here,
and we will reconvene

07:33.244 --> 07:35.746
after I've had a chance
to talk with my client.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.707
There will be no reconvening.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.375
This happens today.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.710
Absolutely not.

07:41.210 --> 07:43.296
Could I have a word with you, ma'am?

07:44.005 --> 07:45.673
We'll debrief after, Miller.

07:45.756 --> 07:47.467
Respectfully, ma'am.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.218
A moment, please.

07:56.976 --> 08:00.313
If we're not here to take down
this organization, then,

08:00.396 --> 08:03.399
all due respect,
what the fuck are we doing here?

08:03.483 --> 08:05.359
You actually thought
we were gonna bring down

08:05.443 --> 08:07.403
one of the biggest cartels 
in North America?

08:07.487 --> 08:08.779
Yes, I did.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.949
Because that's what we've been
saying for months, ma'am. So yes.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.159
And then what?

08:13.242 --> 08:15.620
You think the War on Drugs just ends?

08:15.703 --> 08:17.413
No one else fills that void?

08:17.914 --> 08:21.375
We're collaborating so that we can
make progress on all of it.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.002
Big picture.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.172
And here I thought you were justifying

08:26.255 --> 08:28.633
taking five more years' worth
of money seizures.

08:30.468 --> 08:31.594
[Clay scoffs softly]

08:32.261 --> 08:34.931
It's not the Bureau's job
to explain itself to you.

08:37.850 --> 08:38.976
Why not tell me?

08:39.936 --> 08:41.729
Why bushwhack me
in the middle of a meeting?

08:41.812 --> 08:43.064
Because you're righteous.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.816
And you border on liability.

08:47.193 --> 08:50.947
My mistake was thinking you had enough
professionalism to keep your mouth shut.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.867
Now I expect you to fall in line.

08:59.288 --> 09:00.414
[Maya sighs]

09:00.498 --> 09:03.084
This is quite a situation, Mr. Navarro.

09:03.167 --> 09:06.420
With no time served,
this is an unprecedented offer.

09:07.171 --> 09:09.090
Do you understand
what you're asking me to do?

09:09.173 --> 09:12.134
I'm asking you to continue on,
business as usual.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.679
Yeah, but you-- you know,
you force him to Mexico,

09:14.762 --> 09:16.639
you-- you force a volatile situation

09:16.722 --> 09:20.268
that will definitely interrupt cash flow.
I'm sure you don't want that.

09:20.351 --> 09:22.478
No, they know exactly
what they want, Marty.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.106
They want me to kill my nephew
and pay for the privilege.

09:25.189 --> 09:28.651
I acknowledge the difficulties
dealing with Mr. Elizondro may present,

09:28.734 --> 09:32.363
but the Bureau is confident
that Mr. Navarro can handle it.

09:32.863 --> 09:34.865
[sighing] Okay.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.033
[clears his throat]

09:36.659 --> 09:38.494
What can I offer you? Huh?

09:39.245 --> 09:40.454
Right here, right now.

09:41.455 --> 09:42.456
Name your price.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.917
We're not looking for a payout.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.378
We're looking for a relationship.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.799
A relationship…

09:55.344 --> 09:56.762
A relationship?!

09:56.846 --> 09:58.389
How… How about one year?

09:59.557 --> 10:02.518
How about a one-year relationship?

10:03.227 --> 10:05.980
You… You could convince your nephew that…

10:06.063 --> 10:08.858
that things are dragging
on the financial side.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.611
You-- You could downplay
the transition there,

10:11.694 --> 10:17.366
and you, you could reconsider
Mr. Navarro's offer of a one-time fee,

10:17.450 --> 10:21.329
in addition to a year
of intelligence and continued seizures.

10:21.412 --> 10:26.167
The Bureau doesn't compromise
with mass murdering drug traffickers.

10:26.250 --> 10:29.712
It's our position that warlords
and violent criminals

10:29.795 --> 10:32.173
should be grateful when we show mercy.

10:38.262 --> 10:40.473
You would be wise to make this work.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.608
[Marty] Guess it's better
than no deal at all, huh?

10:50.691 --> 10:54.403
They send me home to kill my family
and expect me to do business with them.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.155
I should end them all right now.

10:57.698 --> 10:58.991
What about if, uh…

10:59.075 --> 11:01.994
What about if you tell Javi
that there was a force majeure

11:02.078 --> 11:04.955
with the legitimate holdings,
and that you need more time?

11:05.039 --> 11:07.917
[grunts] I can't go back
on my word, Marty.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.211
The boy is too stupid and too dangerous.

11:10.294 --> 11:13.047
[Wendy] If you give the FBI
what they want right now,

11:14.215 --> 11:15.341
you will get out.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.677
It won't be today,

11:18.469 --> 11:21.347
but you'll still be young.
Your children will still be young.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.725
These people are liars.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.479
In five years, they will fuck me again.

11:30.272 --> 11:32.066
There is no guarantee. I know that.

11:33.609 --> 11:35.820
But I'm not sure
you have a choice right now.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.238
[Omar scoffs]

11:41.033 --> 11:42.451
[shrieks] Ah! Jesus!

11:42.535 --> 11:44.912
I will do that. Thanks.

11:44.995 --> 11:45.913
[phone beeps off]

11:47.456 --> 11:49.125
[Omar sighs]

11:50.459 --> 11:51.377
Five years.

11:52.378 --> 11:55.256
[Graves] We appreciate
your willingness to cooperate.

11:55.840 --> 11:59.135
I'd offer to shake your hand,
but I see you've suffered an injury.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.430
You know, I could have 
my driver get a first aid kit.

12:04.515 --> 12:07.017
Mr. Navarro, in five years' time

12:07.101 --> 12:09.562
your prudence today will be remembered.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.148
[Clay] Mr. and Mrs. Byrde,

12:12.231 --> 12:15.693
the FBI will be assuming
your role for the Navarro Cartel.

12:15.776 --> 12:18.612
You've brought us to this historic moment

12:18.696 --> 12:22.158
and the Bureau thanks you
for your service to America.

12:24.952 --> 12:25.911
You're welcome.

12:30.958 --> 12:34.211
I should have known not to trust
the American government, huh?

12:40.217 --> 12:42.261
Americans can be treacherous, no?

12:44.472 --> 12:45.347
Some.

12:48.726 --> 12:51.103
We didn't want this… like this.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.819
How does it feel? Hmm?

13:01.655 --> 13:02.865
[chuckles] Which part?

13:02.948 --> 13:03.783
I don't know.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.243
Going back to your normal life.

13:07.745 --> 13:08.621
Shock.

13:08.704 --> 13:10.581
No, that's not shock, Wendy…

13:12.374 --> 13:13.584
That is fear.

13:16.504 --> 13:17.880
Fear of the quiet.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.973
It has been a pleasure
watching you work, Wendy Byrde.

13:32.019 --> 13:32.978
Thank you.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.149
Well, that'll do for now.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.484
[in Spanish] You know what?

13:43.155 --> 13:45.908
[in English] When your kids
are away in school, and

13:45.991 --> 13:47.993
your husband is still in the office,

13:48.077 --> 13:50.037
and the bottle of wine is empty,

13:50.120 --> 13:52.456
and the house is dark and it's quiet,

13:53.666 --> 13:55.251
don't forget about me.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.639
What was that all about?

14:10.683 --> 14:12.142
[Marty sighs]

14:14.395 --> 14:16.438
He told me not to forget about him.

14:17.731 --> 14:18.691
[Marty] Mmm.

14:20.317 --> 14:21.443
[inhales sharply]

14:22.778 --> 14:24.321
[sighs and chuckles]

14:26.615 --> 14:27.658
[Wendy scoffs]

14:28.450 --> 14:29.785
Should we call the kids?

14:32.079 --> 14:35.249
[Marty sighs deeply]

14:35.332 --> 14:36.917
Uh, let's take a moment.

14:40.796 --> 14:41.964
[Wendy exhales]

15:02.693 --> 15:06.405
No, I don't like their oat milk. Just, uh…

15:07.615 --> 15:10.284
go to the place by my house. It's easier.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.912
[phone buzzing]

15:14.288 --> 15:15.247
This is Clare.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.708
I am looking at your quarterlies.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.084
[keyboard clacking]

15:19.168 --> 15:21.211
Congratulations on making production.

15:22.004 --> 15:22.838
Uh.

15:23.380 --> 15:24.214
Thank you?

15:25.466 --> 15:28.510
How exactly did that happen
without my product, Ms. Shaw?

15:29.637 --> 15:31.972
I'd hate to hear
you're stepping out on me.

15:35.851 --> 15:36.894
Uh…

15:37.770 --> 15:40.105
Marty provided a stopgap.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.942
Did you meet this stopgap?

15:43.442 --> 15:46.403
No. I met with Marty and his old partner.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.489
What old partner?

15:49.615 --> 15:51.575
I can't remember her name. She's…

15:52.076 --> 15:55.079
Um, she's tiny and has curly blond hair.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.001
From now on, you'll be dealing with me.

16:02.586 --> 16:03.545
[phone beeps off]

16:03.629 --> 16:05.172
[line disconnects]

16:08.884 --> 16:10.928
Don't worry about Jonah.
I'm gonna talk to him.

16:11.011 --> 16:14.974
This is-- This is good.
It's really, really good news.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.851
So we can move back Chicago?

16:17.935 --> 16:19.269
Yeah. Yes, we can.

16:20.771 --> 16:21.981
And I can see my friends?

16:22.064 --> 16:25.776
[chuckling] Yes. Absolutely, you can--
you can see your friends.

16:27.027 --> 16:28.445
[trucks beeping]

16:28.529 --> 16:30.864
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

16:33.826 --> 16:36.286
You can't do that thing
that we talked about.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.914
Why is that? You beat me to it?

16:39.707 --> 16:42.376
My cousin's gonna marry her,
so you can't kill her.

16:42.459 --> 16:44.044
Who the fuck's your cousin?

16:44.753 --> 16:46.171
[Ruth] Don't matter.

16:46.255 --> 16:49.883
I already fucked up his life,
so, you can't kill his girlfriend.

16:49.967 --> 16:52.594
Well, his girlfriend should have
thought about that before.

16:55.222 --> 16:56.432
Why ain't you done it yet?

16:58.600 --> 17:00.561
-You don't want to.
-Oh, no, I want to.

17:00.644 --> 17:02.354
I just haven't gotten to it yet.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.397
[Ruth] Hmm.

17:04.231 --> 17:05.941
Let God sort the bitch out.

17:07.985 --> 17:09.028
[inhales sharply]

17:09.903 --> 17:10.738
Nature, then.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.364
[Frank Jr scoffs]

17:14.366 --> 17:16.618
There's a code for this type of shit.

17:17.202 --> 17:20.706
No one ever has to know
what happened to your dad.

17:21.206 --> 17:22.041
Nobody.

17:22.124 --> 17:24.710
And you can take over
this whole fucking thing

17:24.793 --> 17:26.462
and never have to kill nobody.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.505
Ain't that the better option?

17:36.430 --> 17:38.724
[Ruth clears her throat] Let's end it.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.271
And I'm supposed to just
let this redneck bitch

17:44.354 --> 17:46.899
shoot my dick off and kill my dad? Nah.

17:48.609 --> 17:51.153
Listen, I'm begging you.

17:51.236 --> 17:54.823
Now, I know we ain't had the best start,

17:55.532 --> 17:57.785
but we aren't that different
from each other. And…

17:58.577 --> 17:59.620
And I'm…

18:00.662 --> 18:01.830
I'm… Fuck.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.249
I-I-- I'm just-- I'm just asking you,

18:04.333 --> 18:07.711
just please leave it.
Just please leave it alone.

18:13.967 --> 18:14.885
Okay.

18:17.221 --> 18:18.889
Okay. I won't touch her.

18:20.724 --> 18:21.892
You-- You have my word.

18:25.687 --> 18:26.563
Okay.

18:39.034 --> 18:39.952
[car door opens]

18:40.035 --> 18:43.539
-[sirens wailing]
-[tires screeching]

18:51.088 --> 18:52.840
[officer] Hands! Put 'em up!

18:52.923 --> 18:54.341
[bodies thudding]

18:57.302 --> 18:59.304
[distorted soundscape]

19:05.018 --> 19:06.770
[voices echoing] Get on the ground!

19:07.563 --> 19:08.814
Get on the ground!

19:16.280 --> 19:17.114
Cuff him.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.159
[Maya] Omar Navarro.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.828
You are being placed under arrest.

19:23.412 --> 19:26.999
You have the right to remain silent
and refuse any questioning.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.669
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

19:30.752 --> 19:34.047
You have the right to an attorney
before speaking to the police.

19:34.548 --> 19:37.050
[voice fading]
Or to have an attorney present…

19:37.134 --> 19:39.595
-[clock ticking]
-[high frequency droning]

19:41.430 --> 19:43.849
[reporter] An incredible scene
in Central Missouri today

19:43.932 --> 19:47.060
after authorities descended onto
a private airfield in Polk County

19:47.144 --> 19:49.688
and arrested Mexican drug kingpin
Omar Navarro.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.106
The scene is still very active,

19:51.190 --> 19:53.275
as you can see behind me
with a very heavy police--

19:53.358 --> 19:54.318
Holy shit.

19:56.236 --> 19:59.239
You know, we have no idea
what Navarro is thinking.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.742
You know, he could think 
we had something to do with this

20:01.825 --> 20:04.578
or Javi could think that we had
something to do with it. So we just--

20:04.661 --> 20:07.998
We need to be careful, you know.
We need to stay aware and be careful.

20:08.081 --> 20:09.708
-You listening to me?
-[Charlotte] Yes.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.168
-Here.
-Oh, great. Thank you.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.003
-[Charlotte] No.
-You don't have to use it.

20:13.086 --> 20:15.297
-Well, then why do I have to take it?
-Charlotte!

20:17.591 --> 20:20.594
Just get your brother,
get to the spot, and stay there.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.804
[line ringing]

20:24.014 --> 20:26.475
God damn it.
Why the fuck would Maya do this?

20:26.558 --> 20:28.602
Yeah, well, you tell me.

20:29.686 --> 20:32.105
All right, Charlotte,
I want you to, uh, be careful.

20:32.189 --> 20:34.775
Keep your eyes open,
and your phone on at all times.

20:34.858 --> 20:36.485
-[car starts]
-Okay, promise.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.488
Our hands are tied.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.574
The arrest is on every
media outlet in the fucking world.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.202
The man has no idea
why he's sitting in a jail cell.

20:45.285 --> 20:48.038
His default will be to kill anyone
who might have been involved.

20:48.121 --> 20:49.998
Then I suggest you hide.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.377
Well, what if… What-- Hang on.

20:53.460 --> 20:56.046
What if we do the same thing
with Javi instead?

20:56.129 --> 20:58.548
Now that Maya has
screwed up our Navarro plan,

20:58.632 --> 21:00.884
let's just do the same thing
with his nephew.

21:01.593 --> 21:04.096
-We won't deal with Elizondro.
-No?

21:04.179 --> 21:06.390
And that's… that's it? This is, uh…

21:07.307 --> 21:10.936
I mean, the FBI has been
enjoying a cash infusion

21:11.019 --> 21:14.106
of-- of about what,
$30 million this quarter?

21:14.189 --> 21:17.150
That's-- That's a lot of law and order.
It's a lot of… [inhales sharply]

21:17.234 --> 21:19.736
…task force funding and-- and bonus bumps.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.783
For the Bureau to do business
with Javier Elizondro--

21:24.866 --> 21:26.535
[Wendy] We'll get you a higher fee.

21:26.618 --> 21:27.494
Much higher.

21:28.161 --> 21:30.080
I just-- I need to talk to Navarro.

21:30.163 --> 21:31.957
[scoffs] Not possible.

21:32.749 --> 21:34.042
What if you talk to him?

21:39.464 --> 21:41.967
The FBI's not going anywhere near the man.

21:42.634 --> 21:43.719
Of course not.

21:45.220 --> 21:46.638
None of this is happening.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.516
[keypad beeping]

21:50.934 --> 21:52.477
[line rings]

21:52.561 --> 21:54.521
[Javi] I told my uncle, don't kill Helen.

21:54.604 --> 21:57.024
Kill the other white meat.
He just wouldn't listen.

21:57.107 --> 21:59.776
We had nothing to do with this.
This was one agent acting alone.

22:00.527 --> 22:02.195
And now I get to kill you.

22:02.279 --> 22:05.240
Hey, we can turn this
into an opportunity for you, Javi.

22:06.408 --> 22:08.577
And I really want to kill you, you know?

22:09.995 --> 22:11.705
[sighs deeply]

22:11.788 --> 22:13.206
I'm gonna make a meal of it.

22:14.166 --> 22:17.461
The airfield is taped off.
You can't get to your jet,

22:17.544 --> 22:20.964
so just give us a little bit of time
on this, okay? Just some time.

22:21.798 --> 22:23.175
I'll give you 90 minutes.

22:23.258 --> 22:24.092
[phone beeps off]

22:24.176 --> 22:25.427
[line disconnects]

22:28.555 --> 22:29.890
[Marty sighs]

22:30.432 --> 22:33.393
[reporter] While local authorities from
Polk County assisted with the arrest,

22:33.477 --> 22:36.313
Navarro has been transferred
into federal custody.

22:36.396 --> 22:39.733
The leader of what's rumored
to be the largest cartel in Mexico.

22:39.816 --> 22:42.235
-What did you do?
-Navarro's been long on the FBI's list

22:42.319 --> 22:44.237
-…of Most Wanted fugitives.
-My job.

22:44.321 --> 22:45.697
His arrest comes on the heels

22:45.781 --> 22:49.659
of a recent escalation in
cartel-related violence in Mexico,

22:49.743 --> 22:52.496
culminating in the dramatic
joint US/Mexico raid

22:52.579 --> 22:53.914
of Navarro's longtime rival…

22:53.997 --> 22:56.083
-[car approaching]
-…the Lagunas Cartel.

23:13.141 --> 23:15.143
Okay, I don't have time
for you to be an asshole.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.646
I'm not a part of this anymore.
What don't you understand?

23:17.729 --> 23:20.649
They're not up to date on
the inner workings of our family, Jonah,

23:20.732 --> 23:22.109
and they will kill you.

23:36.039 --> 23:37.499
[phone ringing]

23:40.377 --> 23:41.211
Hey, Jim.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.004
We need to get you insulated on this.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.632
-Listen, I'll have to call you back.
-The entire operation

23:45.715 --> 23:48.218
from the casino
to the smallest subsidiary,

23:48.301 --> 23:49.636
has got to be bulletproof.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.139
They are bulletproof.

23:52.222 --> 23:55.892
No, I'm not going to prison over this.
There's some papers I need you to sign.

23:55.976 --> 23:57.185
The papers can wait, Jim.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.478
Get to my house right now

23:58.562 --> 24:01.690
or I start making some phone calls
that make your life very difficult.

Double golden gloriosa black-eyed Susan.

[chatter on TV]

24:50.780 --> 24:52.199
[woman] You watch Idol?

Oh, American Idol?

25:01.249 --> 25:02.083
Thank you, ma'am.

25:02.834 --> 25:04.044
Call me Chuck.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.087
Can I touch your head?

25:06.630 --> 25:07.714
[Ruth] Oh…

25:07.797 --> 25:09.216
[Chuck sniffs]

25:09.299 --> 25:11.927
Oh… my Lord.

25:12.761 --> 25:15.263
I didn't realize how much
I missed your mama.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.559
You should watch it.

25:20.685 --> 25:24.105
I was afraid Katy Perry was
gonna give me a fucking cavity,

25:24.189 --> 25:26.816
but… she's a doll baby.

25:28.026 --> 25:31.863
And I love Lionel Richie.

25:32.989 --> 25:34.324
You know Lionel Richie?

25:34.866 --> 25:37.035
Uh,"Dancing on the Ceiling"?

25:37.118 --> 25:38.578
Fuck, "Dancing on the Ceiling."

25:39.788 --> 25:41.581
Missouri pink love apple.

25:41.665 --> 25:42.666
It's a tomato.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.669
And I know I have it.

25:45.752 --> 25:47.170
Um…

25:47.254 --> 25:48.672
Oh, here it is.

25:50.006 --> 25:52.008
This is Lionel Richie.

25:53.927 --> 25:54.970
Thank you.

Oh, this is good.

Sunset runners and cactus snowman zinnias.

26:02.143 --> 26:04.521
Let's see. Bull's blood.

And Empress of India.

[drawer scrapes shut]

26:10.443 --> 26:12.904
Your mom ever tell you
she caught my shed on fire?

26:12.988 --> 26:15.699
-[chuckling] No.
-It was my piece-of-shit husband's shed.

26:16.199 --> 26:19.119
He died in a boating accident,
bled to death on his Thundercat.

26:19.202 --> 26:20.161
Whoopsy daisy.

26:22.497 --> 26:25.208
[sighs] Whatever happened to Cade?

26:25.792 --> 26:27.586
That dick-washin' asshole.

26:31.381 --> 26:32.215
He's dead.

26:32.799 --> 26:35.051
Good. You're better off an orphan.

26:35.677 --> 26:37.137
Sorry for your loss.

26:38.054 --> 26:42.267
Now, I'm gonna give you
some Hungarian wax peppers.

26:42.767 --> 26:46.146
But they're so hot, they'll bleach
your asshole from the inside out,

26:46.229 --> 26:47.772
so proceed with caution.

26:52.110 --> 26:53.278
[Ruth chuckles]

26:54.362 --> 26:55.196
Thank you.

26:59.075 --> 27:00.410
[knocking on door]

27:05.790 --> 27:06.875
-Hey.
-Hi.

27:07.375 --> 27:08.418
I'm sorry.

27:08.501 --> 27:11.838
Yeah, I just wish that we could have
done this a bit later. I got stuff--

27:12.422 --> 27:13.715
[grunting]

27:15.925 --> 27:19.346
[panting] Javi, we didn't do this.

27:20.305 --> 27:21.973
Okay? We had nothing to do with it.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.725
Wendy is with your uncle right now.

27:24.351 --> 27:25.518
Just let me explain.

27:25.602 --> 27:26.895
Come on. Let me explain.

27:26.978 --> 27:28.980
Let me exp-- Ah! [groaning]

27:29.064 --> 27:30.774
[clattering]

27:30.857 --> 27:32.400
[door buzzes]

27:32.484 --> 27:34.486
[prisoners chattering]

27:35.904 --> 27:39.240
[Wendy] I need you to call Javi and tell
him you were working with the FBI.

27:41.576 --> 27:43.495
You know we didn't do this.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.208
We made a major error

27:49.250 --> 27:50.835
when it came to Agent Miller.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.214
But they still want Javi.

27:55.799 --> 27:57.634
You-- You heard Clay at the meeting.

27:58.218 --> 28:01.262
Convince Javi to take the same deal
that you were gonna take.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.598
If they get him in a room,
they can arrest him,

28:04.099 --> 28:07.143
and they'll extradite you back to Mexico.
I've already worked it out.

28:08.978 --> 28:10.438
You have that in writing?

28:11.815 --> 28:13.692
They're not gonna put that in writing.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.319
How do you think I'm here?

28:17.696 --> 28:19.698
How do you think I got a phone in here?

28:27.288 --> 28:29.582
This morning, you were
willing to give them everything.

28:31.793 --> 28:35.088
This morning was a long time ago, Wendy.

28:35.630 --> 28:37.173
[sinister music playing]

28:37.257 --> 28:40.593
We can make this whole thing… [coughing]

28:40.677 --> 28:43.054
…work to your advantage. Okay?

28:44.013 --> 28:44.848
[Javi] Okay.

28:44.931 --> 28:46.933
Just let me… [panting]

28:47.642 --> 28:50.019
Just give me some time. Okay?

28:50.729 --> 28:52.647
Okay, you know what? You're right.

28:55.024 --> 28:57.986
Why don't you go grab a bottle of Scotch
and we'll sort this out?

29:04.492 --> 29:06.953
-[Jim] Stop it!
-Shut the fuck up!

29:07.036 --> 29:09.414
-[Marty groaning]
-[screaming] Shut the fuck up!

29:10.039 --> 29:12.876
They will extradite you back to Mexico.

29:12.959 --> 29:16.629
You can walk away from all of this,
I swear on my life.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.467
On my children's lives. Just…

29:23.428 --> 29:24.387
Call Javi.

29:30.560 --> 29:35.064
[Marty] I can guarantee you
a deal with the US government.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.984
Okay? You can run the whole cartel

29:38.943 --> 29:40.278
with absolute freedom.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.239
I can prove it.
It's exactly what your uncle was doing.

29:43.323 --> 29:45.992
The FBI wants to make a deal.
They want to make a deal with you.

29:46.075 --> 29:48.411
Blah, blah, blah.
You like your mouth, don't you?

29:48.495 --> 29:50.705
I'm telling you the truth! [grunts]

29:51.206 --> 29:52.332
[Javi groans]

29:52.415 --> 29:54.542
[Marty groaning]

29:54.626 --> 29:57.962
[panting] Javi!
Javi, Javi, Javi, Javi. Javi.

29:58.046 --> 29:59.881
Javi, come-- Come on.
Please, please, please.

29:59.964 --> 30:01.674
-[phone ringing]
-[Marty panting]

30:02.258 --> 30:03.301
Answer that.

30:04.177 --> 30:05.261
Answer that.

30:05.345 --> 30:07.347
Please, just answer that. That's them.

30:07.847 --> 30:09.182
[phone continues ringing]

30:10.725 --> 30:11.684
Please.

30:15.814 --> 30:16.898
[phone beeps]

30:16.981 --> 30:18.274
[in Spanish] Hello?

30:24.864 --> 30:25.824
Yes, I understand.

30:32.288 --> 30:34.582
[in English] Looks like
God gave you another day.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.668
[Marty panting]

30:36.751 --> 30:37.919
How about that Scotch?

30:44.717 --> 30:45.593
Thank you.

30:46.636 --> 30:49.097
We'll set a meeting
for the morning with Javi and the FBI.

30:52.183 --> 30:55.937
I am out of this place in 48 hours
or Nelson has orders to end you.

30:57.897 --> 31:00.233
So, for your sake,
I hope you're not fucking me.

31:00.316 --> 31:01.150
I'm not.

31:02.318 --> 31:03.736
You'll be out in 48 hours.

31:04.571 --> 31:06.072
[door buzzing in background]

31:12.579 --> 31:13.705
[door buzzes]

31:13.788 --> 31:15.373
[Jonah] She tried to have me arrested.

31:15.456 --> 31:17.500
[Charlotte] I'm not saying that it's good.

31:18.042 --> 31:19.794
Then what are you saying, exactly?

31:21.921 --> 31:22.881
I don't know.

31:22.964 --> 31:25.008
I think they're doing the best they can.

31:25.091 --> 31:27.969
[scoffs] I think you have
Stockholm Syndrome.

31:29.012 --> 31:31.556
Don't act like
you've always been against this.

31:31.639 --> 31:34.309
You know, you were
their little helper in the beginning,

31:34.392 --> 31:35.852
and you wanted to move here

31:35.935 --> 31:38.271
because you didn't have
any friends in Chicago.

31:39.606 --> 31:40.690
So what did you care?

31:41.357 --> 31:42.233
[scoffs]

31:42.775 --> 31:44.485
You are exactly like Mom.

31:44.569 --> 31:45.862
Fuck you.

31:46.946 --> 31:47.864
Yeah. See?

31:50.700 --> 31:51.993
Look, I'm sorry.

31:56.789 --> 31:59.083
I-I don't want to fight and

31:59.167 --> 32:00.877
I'm not siding with Mom. Okay?

32:00.960 --> 32:02.295
I'm really not.

32:05.256 --> 32:07.926
After Ben died, I asked you
if you'd have me killed.

32:10.428 --> 32:13.264
You said, "It's not the same thing.
He had a mental illness."

32:16.017 --> 32:19.187
I just needed you to say,
"I'd never kill you. Don't be insane."

32:23.274 --> 32:24.651
I'd never kill you.

32:25.610 --> 32:26.903
Don't be insane.

32:29.864 --> 32:30.823
Well, thank you.

32:39.165 --> 32:42.293
You ever think about
what you'd do if they were--

32:42.377 --> 32:43.211
Dead?

32:45.380 --> 32:47.006
Yeah, I've thought about it.

32:48.549 --> 32:49.384
Have you?

32:52.178 --> 32:53.930
You'd wanna stick together, right?

32:54.847 --> 32:55.848
If they were?

32:56.933 --> 32:57.809
Yeah.

33:01.229 --> 33:02.814
If anything happened to them,

33:03.940 --> 33:04.816
we'd run.

33:06.776 --> 33:07.902
I know what we'd do.

33:09.070 --> 33:13.449
We'd go to the…
Pacific Northwest or something, and

33:13.992 --> 33:17.245
get an apartment
and we'd have new names and, um…

33:19.580 --> 33:20.498
we'd be fine.

33:28.131 --> 33:30.091
We're always going to be fine.

33:31.676 --> 33:32.510
Okay?

33:36.848 --> 33:37.807
[inhales]

33:38.725 --> 33:40.101
I need a favor.

33:40.184 --> 33:41.769
What kind of favor?

33:42.729 --> 33:45.690
And… you just ever lose your fucking keys?

33:45.773 --> 33:47.859
Or is every goddamn thing
with you DEFCON 5?

33:48.359 --> 33:52.822
Well, you know, actually, uh,
DEFCON 1 is-- is worse than DEFCON 5.

33:52.905 --> 33:54.490
Well, they're all fucking bad, Marty.

33:55.074 --> 33:57.785
All right, um, I need you to, um…

33:57.869 --> 34:00.079
I need you to go by the house
in the morning.

34:00.163 --> 34:02.415
And if-- if Wendy and I are not there,

34:02.498 --> 34:04.917
I need you to go
to where we hide the money. Okay?

34:05.001 --> 34:08.254
And I need you to grab Charlotte and Jonah
and I need you to get them out of town.

34:08.337 --> 34:09.213
Can you do that?

34:09.297 --> 34:10.590
What the fuck's going on?

34:11.758 --> 34:15.094
I'm just-- I'm dealing with a…
with a very erratic guy.

34:17.180 --> 34:18.181
Navarro.

34:18.264 --> 34:21.017
His nephew and… his buddies.

34:21.100 --> 34:22.727
Can you-- Can you do this for me?

34:23.352 --> 34:27.315
[inhales] Well, I'm sure
you'll tap dance your way

34:27.398 --> 34:29.358
straight through whatever this is.

34:31.778 --> 34:33.237
If I don't, can you help me?

34:39.202 --> 34:40.661
Of course I fucking will.

34:42.830 --> 34:43.706
Thank you.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.878
Why would they make DEFCON 1
worse than DEFCON 5?

34:49.420 --> 34:52.465
[waterfowl crying]

34:54.133 --> 34:56.260
[keypad clicking]

35:13.903 --> 35:17.031
We're just taking him.
We'll call you with a location. Come on.

35:26.457 --> 35:28.209
[engine turns over]

35:28.292 --> 35:30.294
[ominous music playing]

35:50.606 --> 35:51.524
Good Lord.

35:56.696 --> 35:57.947
See? You look nice!

35:58.030 --> 35:59.073
Not bad, right?

36:00.158 --> 36:01.993
It's weird you won't be there tomorrow.

36:02.076 --> 36:05.538
[scoffs] Me not being there is the least
weird thing about this wedding.

36:05.621 --> 36:06.455
True.

36:06.956 --> 36:09.083
Think she's gonna, like,
eat him or something?

36:10.001 --> 36:13.004
[scoffs] What the fuck 
are you talkin' about?

36:13.087 --> 36:15.256
-[Three laughing]
-Nobody's eatin' nobody.

36:15.339 --> 36:18.050
But I can see how she'd strike you
as the eatin' type.

36:18.134 --> 36:20.344
[Three grunts] Can I wear this too?

36:21.679 --> 36:24.056
No. Now fix your hair back.

36:27.268 --> 36:28.436
[Three sighs]

36:29.520 --> 36:32.148
He doesn't want to meet here.
I got the call on the drive over,

36:32.231 --> 36:34.692
but I have a safe location.
It's one of our businesses.

36:34.775 --> 36:36.569
[Graves] Absolutely not.

36:37.820 --> 36:40.114
But you-- you were--
you were willing to meet with him.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.324
Here.

36:41.407 --> 36:42.783
We are so close!

36:42.867 --> 36:43.910
It's over.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.412
Look, if you don't help me,

36:46.495 --> 36:50.124
I'll have nothing to lose
and I will expose everything you've done!

36:50.208 --> 36:54.378
I don't think you want to learn,
in a very public way, I don't bluff!

36:56.756 --> 37:00.259
Sealing the casket will prevent
Mrs. Donarski from biodegrading

37:00.343 --> 37:03.179
as quickly as she would
were she not sealed.

37:03.262 --> 37:05.681
Now, for even more protection
against the elements,

37:05.765 --> 37:09.018
-a casket vault is very thoughtful.
-Harry, there you are. Hi, um, sir.

37:09.101 --> 37:12.563
Uh, don't mean to interrupt, but we do
have to shut down, uh, for the day. Okay?

37:12.647 --> 37:13.731
-Martin?
-[Marty] Yep?

37:13.814 --> 37:15.566
-This is Chip Donarski.
-Okay.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.193
His wife has recently passed.

37:17.276 --> 37:19.862
Oh, well, I'm so sorry for your loss,

37:19.946 --> 37:22.448
but I am going to
have to ask you to leave.

37:23.407 --> 37:24.242
Alrighty?

37:26.035 --> 37:27.787
Yeah. I know it.

37:28.454 --> 37:30.706
But for your… for your--
For your troubles,

37:30.790 --> 37:32.541
we're gonna, let's…

37:32.625 --> 37:34.835
we'll knock 15% off of this.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.754
Okay? Is this the one you like?

37:36.837 --> 37:38.589
She's a beauty, okay?

37:40.299 --> 37:42.843
Twenty percent,
we're going to do 20%. Okay?

37:43.678 --> 37:46.764
Or 25, I don't care.
I need you out in five minutes, damn it.

37:46.847 --> 37:47.974
[Chip sighs]

37:49.976 --> 37:52.979
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today

37:53.604 --> 37:58.693
to join this man and this woman
in bonds of holy matrimony.

38:00.903 --> 38:03.698
You'll run the cartel freely
as long as you continue to meet

38:03.781 --> 38:05.992
the fiscal stipulations we've agreed to.

38:06.075 --> 38:07.201
[Javi] And immunity?

38:07.285 --> 38:08.869
After ten years' time.

38:09.662 --> 38:14.125
However, should anyone
outside of our agreement

38:14.208 --> 38:16.294
ever learn about any of this,

38:16.836 --> 38:19.171
you can expect
the full force of the Bureau

38:19.255 --> 38:20.840
to come knocking at your door.

38:21.549 --> 38:23.592
-That goes for all of you.
-Oh, no, no no.

38:23.676 --> 38:25.344
God forbid the full force.

38:26.470 --> 38:27.763
[Javi scoffs]

38:27.847 --> 38:29.849
[tense music builds]

38:33.311 --> 38:34.478
[Clay] We have a deal?

38:37.690 --> 38:38.524
We do.

38:42.278 --> 38:43.195
I do.

38:44.613 --> 38:47.950
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

38:49.243 --> 38:51.495
You can go ahead and kiss your bride.

38:56.292 --> 38:58.002
[Zeke gurgling]

38:58.878 --> 38:59.712
Thank you.

39:00.212 --> 39:01.213
[softly] Of course.

39:15.644 --> 39:17.355
[snickers]

39:20.941 --> 39:24.445
[Wendy] If anything happens to us,
your children lose access to that money.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.864
[Marty] Any legal entity
that you've built for them,

39:26.947 --> 39:29.825
any legitimate capital
would no longer be viable.

39:29.909 --> 39:31.452
What happened to us, Wendy?

39:31.535 --> 39:33.454
[Marty] As long as our family is safe--

39:33.537 --> 39:35.539
My children will want for nothing.

39:36.332 --> 39:37.833
My reach is deep. Is that all?

39:38.334 --> 39:41.921
Javi doesn't know that you gave him
and the entire cartel up to the FBI.

39:44.256 --> 39:46.717
We kept that to ourselves
to preserve your life.

39:47.676 --> 39:48.928
But you know your nephew.

39:49.845 --> 39:52.640
He'd want you to suffer for
a betrayal like that, don't you think?

39:53.724 --> 39:57.937
And with a… a-- a guy unstable that, uh…

39:58.854 --> 39:59.688
well…

40:00.731 --> 40:02.441
You know, he could go after your kids.

40:08.114 --> 40:10.699
You didn't have to put
your children in hiding today.

40:12.201 --> 40:13.327
In a tomb.

40:14.995 --> 40:16.288
With a shotgun?

40:19.375 --> 40:20.751
I don't kill children.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.923
I don't threaten to kill children.

40:31.762 --> 40:35.391
We didn't mean for it to turn out this
way, believe it or not. We really didn't.

40:40.187 --> 40:41.522
You disappoint me.

40:48.070 --> 40:49.822
Especially you, Wendy.

I wouldn't have picked up.
I'm just getting the rest of my things.

43:13.424 --> 43:15.718
Jonah. There's a lot going on.

45:45.534 --> 45:48.579
We told you from the beginning
to stop selling heroin,

45:48.662 --> 45:50.330
but you just wouldn't listen.

45:50.414 --> 45:52.332
