WEBVTT

00:05.588 --> 00:08.841
Charlie Brown. Oh, Charlie Brown.

00:10.885 --> 00:12.553
I can't believe it.

00:12.720 --> 00:16.097
She must think
I'm the most stupid person alive.

00:20.978 --> 00:24.690
Come on, Charlie Brown.
I'll hold the ball and you kick it.

00:27.068 --> 00:28.778
Hold it? Ha!

00:29.028 --> 00:33.074
You'll pull it away and I'll land
flat on my back and kill myself.

00:33.950 --> 00:36.911
But Charlie Brown, it's Thanksgiving.

00:37.078 --> 00:39.622
What's that got to do with anything?

00:41.165 --> 00:43.292
Why, one of the greatest traditions
we have

00:43.501 --> 00:45.211
is the Thanksgiving Day football game.

00:45.378 --> 00:50.091
And the biggest, most important tradition
of all is the kicking off of the football.

00:51.175 --> 00:52.802
Is that right?

00:53.427 --> 00:57.431
Absolutely. Come on, Charlie Brown.
It's a big honor for you.

01:01.477 --> 01:04.021
Well, if it's that important,

01:04.188 --> 01:07.358
a person should never turn down
a big honor.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.736
Maybe I should do it.

01:14.615 --> 01:19.495
Besides, she wouldn't try to trick me
on a traditional holiday.

01:21.080 --> 01:24.667
This time I'm gonna kick that football
clear to the moon.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074

01:33.134 --> 01:38.180
Isn't it peculiar, Charlie Brown,
how some traditions just slowly fade away?

01:57.241 --> 01:59.660
What's the matter, big brother?

01:59.827 --> 02:02.747
Nothing.
I was just checking the mail box.

02:03.873 --> 02:06.792
What did you expect? A turkey card?

02:07.710 --> 02:09.586
Holidays always depress me.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.214
I know what you mean.

02:12.381 --> 02:14.967
I went down to buy a turkey tree,

02:15.384 --> 02:18.471
and all they have
are things for Christmas.

02:19.138 --> 02:21.515
For Christmas? Already?

02:22.642 --> 02:26.312
Anyway, why should I give thanks
on Thanksgiving?

02:26.604 --> 02:28.856
What have I got to be thankful for?

02:29.148 --> 02:32.985
All it does is make more work for us
at school.

02:34.195 --> 02:37.615
Do you know what we have to do now?

02:39.659 --> 02:43.079
We have to write an essay
on Stanley Miles.

02:44.455 --> 02:46.749
You mean Myles Standish.

02:47.166 --> 02:49.919
I can't keep track of all those people.

02:50.086 --> 02:51.962
What's all the commotion?

02:52.129 --> 02:55.174
We've got another holiday to worry about.

02:55.925 --> 02:58.761
It seems Thanksgiving Day is upon us.

02:59.095 --> 03:02.765
I haven't even finished eating
all my Halloween candy.

03:03.015 --> 03:06.686
Sally, Thanksgiving
is a very important holiday.

03:07.186 --> 03:11.941
Ours was the first country in the world
to make a national holiday to give thanks.

03:13.150 --> 03:16.070
Isn't he the cutest thing?

03:18.114 --> 03:20.991
What are you gonna do on Thanksgiving,
Charlie Brown?

03:21.534 --> 03:23.369
My mother and dad and Sally and I

03:23.536 --> 03:26.706
are all going over
to my grandmother's for dinner.

03:27.748 --> 03:30.167
Why don't you come along, Linus?

03:30.418 --> 03:32.503
We could hold hands under the table.

03:42.847 --> 03:44.140
Hello?

03:44.306 --> 03:46.600
Hi, Chuck. This is Peppermint Patty.

03:46.767 --> 03:48.394
How you been, Chuck?

03:49.228 --> 03:50.896
Okay, I guess.

03:51.230 --> 03:52.982
<i>Do you kind of miss me, Chuck?</i>

03:53.315 --> 03:56.193
- Well, I, uh...
- That's okay, Chuck.

03:56.485 --> 03:58.821
I know you probably can't talk
because someone's listening.

03:59.739 --> 04:02.742
We'll keep these intimate things
to ourselves, okay, Chuck?

04:03.200 --> 04:05.244
<i>Well, I, uh...</i>

04:05.494 --> 04:08.998
Listen, I really have a treat for you.
My dad's been called out of town.

04:09.331 --> 04:12.501
He said I could go over to your house
and share Thanksgiving with you, Chuck.

04:12.793 --> 04:14.962
Well, I, uh...

04:15.171 --> 04:18.507
I don't mind inviting myself over
because I know you kind of like me, Chuck.

04:18.923 --> 04:20.216
Well, I, uh...

04:20.468 --> 04:21.886
Okay, that's a date.

04:22.511 --> 04:24.722
See you soon, you sly devil.

04:25.556 --> 04:28.684
- Oh, brother.
- Now what?

04:29.018 --> 04:31.854
Peppermint Patty's coming
to Thanksgiving dinner.

04:32.146 --> 04:33.981
We won't even be home.

04:37.067 --> 04:38.944
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, Chuck.</i>

04:39.195 --> 04:41.363
Listen, I have even greater news.

04:41.822 --> 04:44.241
- Remember that great kid, Marcie?
- Sure.

04:44.533 --> 04:47.495
<i>I just talked to her and she kind of
would like to see you again.</i>

04:48.496 --> 04:50.831
And her folks said it would be okay
if she joined us.

04:51.081 --> 04:53.167
<i>So you can count on two for dinner, Chuck.</i>

04:53.584 --> 04:55.252
But I just don't know.

04:55.461 --> 04:58.005
This will be okay with your folks,
won't it, Chuck?

04:58.214 --> 05:00.049
<i>Well, the problem is...</i>

05:00.216 --> 05:02.760
Don't worry, we won't make any problems.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.929
We'll help clean up the dishes
and everything.

05:05.137 --> 05:09.058
Just save me a drumstick and the neck,
okay, Chuck? See you, Chuck.

05:11.435 --> 05:14.355
How do I always get into these things?

05:14.522 --> 05:16.857
Now she's bringing Marcie too.

05:17.066 --> 05:21.362
It's your own fault
because you're so wishy-washy.

05:23.739 --> 05:25.324
Hello?

05:25.574 --> 05:27.618
Hey, guess who just walked in over here.

05:28.244 --> 05:29.411
It's Franklin.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.705
I told him about the big turkey party
you're having,

05:31.956 --> 05:34.124
and he's sure his folks will let him come.

05:34.375 --> 05:38.087
Hey, Chuck, this is gonna be
the biggest bash of the year. See you.

05:39.338 --> 05:42.800
I think I'm losing control
of the whole world.

05:43.843 --> 05:48.055
- Now what's wrong?
- Now she's bringing Franklin too.

05:48.264 --> 05:51.934
Peppermint Patty has invited herself,
Marcie and Franklin over

05:52.101 --> 05:56.105
for Thanksgiving dinner,
and I'm not even going to be home.

05:56.272 --> 05:58.691
I'm going to be at my grandmother's.

05:59.066 --> 06:01.652
Why don't you just call her back
and explain it to her?

06:01.944 --> 06:04.822
You can't explain anything
to Peppermint Patty,

06:05.197 --> 06:07.575
because you never get to say anything.

06:07.825 --> 06:09.618
I'm doomed.

06:09.869 --> 06:13.873
Three guests for Thanksgiving
and I'm not even going to be home.

06:14.748 --> 06:18.127
Peppermint Patty will hate me
for the rest of my life.

06:19.336 --> 06:22.673
What time are you going over
to your grandmother's, Charlie Brown?

06:22.965 --> 06:25.634
We're supposed to be there by 4:30.

06:25.885 --> 06:29.471
Okay, that makes it easy.
You simply have two dinners.

06:29.930 --> 06:32.725
You cook the first one yourself
for your friends

06:32.975 --> 06:36.478
and then you go to your grandmother's
with your family for the second one.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.315
I can't cook a Thanksgiving dinner.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.985
All I can make is cold cereal
and maybe toast.

06:44.987 --> 06:47.615
That's right, I've seen you make toast.

06:47.865 --> 06:50.492
You can't butter it,
but maybe we could help you.

06:51.035 --> 06:53.829
Snoopy, you go out to the garage
and get a table

06:53.996 --> 06:55.831
that we can set up in the back yard.

08:48.068 --> 08:50.362
We don't have any time to play, Snoopy.

08:50.612 --> 08:53.032
Please get some chairs around the table.

10:12.861 --> 10:17.032
What are we going to wear
to this big Thanksgiving party, sir?

10:17.407 --> 10:19.201
And what time do we go?

10:19.409 --> 10:21.620
Well, kid, I'm gonna go like this.

10:21.870 --> 10:25.833
Old Chuck is pretty cool about dates.
He always wears that striped shirt of his.

10:27.209 --> 10:29.044
I just talked to Charlie Brown.

10:29.294 --> 10:31.713
He said dinner will be served
a little earlier.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.340
Great, we're ready.

10:34.049 --> 10:35.717
Do you think I should wear a tie?

10:36.426 --> 10:39.721
No, you can come as you are, Franklin.
Old Chuck won't mind.

10:39.888 --> 10:41.974
Besides, he didn't say it was formal.

10:56.530 --> 10:58.448
Okay, Snoopy, that's pretty good.

10:58.657 --> 11:01.785
Come on inside.
We need some help with the food.

14:39.461 --> 14:41.463
What? Oh, hi, Snoopy.

14:41.671 --> 14:43.131
Come on in.

14:47.677 --> 14:51.765
Snoopy, how can you serve the food
in that ridiculous outfit?

14:54.184 --> 14:56.269
How about your chef's hat?

15:03.235 --> 15:06.863
Come on, Snoopy. We don't have any time
for this playing around.

15:07.489 --> 15:11.952
The guests will be here pretty soon,
so please get ready to help serve them.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.919
- Hi, Chuck.
- Hi, Peppermint Patty.

15:21.169 --> 15:24.297
- Hi, Franklin. Hi, Marcie.
- Hi, Chuck.

15:54.369 --> 15:57.330
Are we going to have a prayer?
It's Thanksgiving, you know?

15:57.706 --> 16:00.375
Before we're served,
shouldn't we say grace?

16:04.421 --> 16:08.800
In the year 1621, the pilgrims held
their first Thanksgiving feast.

16:09.176 --> 16:12.137
They invited
the great Indian chief Massasoit,

16:12.387 --> 16:16.391
who brought 90 of his brave Indians
and a great abundance of food.

16:16.766 --> 16:19.603
<i>Governor William Bradford
and Captain Myles Standish</i>

16:20.061 --> 16:21.146
<i>were honored guests.</i>

16:21.521 --> 16:24.232
Elder William Brewster,
who was a minister,

16:24.524 --> 16:26.735
said a prayer that went
something like this...

16:27.444 --> 16:31.531
"We thank God for our homes and our food
and our safety in a new land."

16:31.990 --> 16:33.909
"We thank God for the opportunity"

16:34.075 --> 16:36.578
"to create a new world
for freedom and justice."

16:37.245 --> 16:38.455
Amen.

17:23.290 --> 17:26.044
What's this? A piece of toast?

17:26.294 --> 17:28.630
A pretzel stick? Popcorn?

17:28.964 --> 17:31.174
What blockhead cooked all this?

17:37.806 --> 17:40.308
What kind of
a Thanksgiving dinner is this?

17:40.517 --> 17:42.018
Where's the turkey, Chuck?

17:42.310 --> 17:44.980
Don't you know anything
about Thanksgiving dinners?

17:45.188 --> 17:49.484
Where's the mashed potatoes?
Where's the cranberry sauce?

17:49.693 --> 17:51.736
Where's the pumpkin pie?

17:57.826 --> 18:01.329
You were kind of rough on Charlie Brown,
weren't you, sir?

18:01.580 --> 18:03.248
Rough? Look at this.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.959
Is this what you call
a Thanksgiving Day dinner?

18:06.209 --> 18:08.295
Did we come across town for this?

18:08.712 --> 18:11.548
We were supposed to be served
a real Thanksgiving dinner.

18:12.215 --> 18:13.883
Now, wait a minute, sir.

18:14.217 --> 18:19.681
Did he invite you here to dinner
or did you invite yourself and us too?

18:20.890 --> 18:24.853
Gee, I never thought of it like that.
Do you think I hurt old Chuck's feelings?

18:25.478 --> 18:27.355
I bet I hurt his feelings, huh?

18:27.647 --> 18:31.026
Golly, why can't I act right
outside of a baseball game?

18:32.861 --> 18:36.323
Marcie, maybe you can go to old Chuck
and patch things up for me.

18:37.032 --> 18:39.034
Maybe you can tell him how I really feel.

18:39.492 --> 18:41.661
Tell him that I didn't mean it
the way it sounded.

18:42.329 --> 18:43.580
Marcie, you can do it.

18:43.788 --> 18:45.915
You go see him and tell him
I really like him,

18:46.166 --> 18:47.606
and that the dinner is okay with me.

18:48.209 --> 18:51.338
Well, I don't know, but I'll try.

18:51.504 --> 18:56.051
I think maybe you should go to Chuck
and tell him yourself.

18:56.551 --> 18:58.845
No, Marcie, I'll just ruin everything.

18:59.054 --> 19:00.764
You know I'm too brusque and rough.

19:01.056 --> 19:04.017
- You go and speak for me.
- Well, okay.

19:06.561 --> 19:09.814
This is not unlike
another famous Thanksgiving episode.

19:10.273 --> 19:13.735
Do you remember the story
of John Alden and Priscilla Mullins,

19:14.069 --> 19:15.945
and Captain Myles Standish?

19:16.237 --> 19:18.156
This isn't like that one at all.

19:19.616 --> 19:21.242
Don't feel bad, Chuck.

19:21.409 --> 19:24.537
Peppermint Patty didn't mean
all those things she said.

19:24.788 --> 19:27.165
Actually, she really likes you.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.751
I don't feel bad for myself.

19:30.085 --> 19:33.838
I just feel bad
because I ruined everyone's Thanksgiving.

19:34.422 --> 19:37.258
But Thanksgiving is more
than eating, Chuck.

19:37.467 --> 19:39.969
You heard what Linus was saying out there.

19:40.303 --> 19:44.766
Those early pilgrims were thankful
for what had happened to them.

19:45.016 --> 19:46.893
And we should be thankful too.

19:47.102 --> 19:50.605
We should just be thankful
for being together.

19:52.524 --> 19:57.445
I think that's what they mean by
"Thanksgiving," Charlie Brown.

19:58.613 --> 20:00.073
Psst. Come here.

20:00.448 --> 20:01.950
See you later, Charles.

20:03.618 --> 20:05.078
Charles?

20:07.747 --> 20:09.833
He's all yours, Priscilla.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.876
Priscilla?

20:12.794 --> 20:14.129
Priscilla?

20:16.464 --> 20:18.967
Apologies accepted, Chuck old boy?

20:19.551 --> 20:20.677
Sure.

20:20.885 --> 20:23.096
There's enough problems
in the world already, Chuck,

20:23.304 --> 20:25.306
without these stupid misunderstandings.

20:26.224 --> 20:28.810
Let's not play lovers' games, Chuck.

20:29.477 --> 20:30.979
I agree.

20:33.690 --> 20:35.734
You're holding my hand, Chuck.

20:36.443 --> 20:38.111
You sly dog.

20:43.616 --> 20:46.119
Good grief, it's 4:00!

20:46.494 --> 20:48.830
We're supposed to be
at Grandmother's house

20:48.997 --> 20:51.458
for Thanksgiving by 4:30.

20:52.667 --> 20:55.962
I better talk to her
and explain my dilemma.

20:59.340 --> 21:01.468
Hello? Grandma?

21:01.718 --> 21:04.679
This is Chuck. I mean, Charlie Brown.

21:04.929 --> 21:06.681
We're gonna be a little late.

21:06.890 --> 21:11.394
You see, I invited a few friends over
and they're still here.

21:15.231 --> 21:18.651
Well, it's just Linus
and a girl named Marcie.

21:19.360 --> 21:21.529
And a girl named Peppermint Patty.

21:21.821 --> 21:25.700
She's a great baseball player.
And a boy named Franklin.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.997
No, ma'am, they haven't eaten.

21:31.247 --> 21:33.958
As a matter of fact,
they've let me know that

21:34.209 --> 21:35.919
in no uncertain terms.

21:38.922 --> 21:40.632
What? You mean it?

21:41.132 --> 21:43.968
Hey, Peppermint Patty, great news.

21:48.306 --> 21:51.559
We're all invited to Charlie Brown's
grandmother's for Thanksgiving dinner.

22:16.251 --> 22:18.336
Isn't there an old song that goes,

22:18.586 --> 22:22.799
"Over the hills and through the woods
to Grandmother's house we go"?

22:23.299 --> 22:25.677
Sure, only this is the way it goes.

22:26.094 --> 22:27.971
<i>Over the river and through the woods.</i>
