00:54.320 --> 00:56.800
Joe!!

01:00.720 --> 01:02.882
Joe!! Joe!!

01:04.519 --> 01:08.411
You've been in there
for 54.. 55 minutes, Joe!!

01:22.040 --> 01:24.559
Masturbation is fun.
I get it.

01:24.560 --> 01:27.006
It's not very green to do it
with the shower running.

01:31.480 --> 01:32.242
Jesus!!

01:33.600 --> 01:35.804
Bring your briefs
in there with you.

01:35.805 --> 01:37.131
You're 15 years old.

01:37.132 --> 01:39.361
It's not cute anymore.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.800
Got his mother's fanny.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.162
Your final was due
a week ago, Joe.

03:37.163 --> 03:39.288
I mean, look..
Look at the board.

03:39.289 --> 03:40.519
School's over.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.602
We're playing hangman here.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.050
There you are.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.719
Hey.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.482
So, are you guys around tonight?

03:59.483 --> 04:02.243
Because you should totally come
to Thirsty Thursdays.

04:02.244 --> 04:04.401
- End-of-school tradition.
- Yeah. Yeah, totally.

04:04.402 --> 04:06.368
- I'll.. I'll be there.
- Cool.

04:06.369 --> 04:09.199
So it's at Wolf's Pond,
whenever you..

04:09.200 --> 04:10.999
Oh.. my God.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.048
Eat shit, Toy!!

04:14.480 --> 04:15.843
I can lend you a shirt.

04:15.844 --> 04:17.524
I've got like five
in my locker.

04:19.519 --> 04:21.567
You know what, actually,
it doesn't look that bad.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.879
So, pregame at Paul's
at like 7:00-ish.

04:25.880 --> 04:27.882
Paul has his own apartment?

04:29.240 --> 04:30.765
What, you're not
going to acknowledge me?

04:30.766 --> 04:32.919
- Hi.
- Mmm. Yeah.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.279
Um, I will see you tonight.

04:35.280 --> 04:36.919
Yes. Yeah, uh..

04:36.920 --> 04:38.239
- Babe.
- Yes?

04:38.240 --> 04:39.479
Let's go get egg bagels.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.959
Okay. All right. Bye.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.167
Paul. God.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.119
I need a shirt.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.679
That's awesome.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.479
That is.. that is great.

04:54.480 --> 04:57.086
Actually, I need a picture.
Shit, can I get my phone?

04:57.087 --> 04:58.599
Hey. Mrs. Keenan?

04:58.600 --> 04:59.999
Shh!!

05:00.000 --> 05:03.479
Patrick, why are you
running around?

05:03.480 --> 05:05.839
Oh.. Grandma,
you remember Joe.

05:05.840 --> 05:08.039
Hi, Mrs. Keenan.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.690
Darling, would you
like a cold washcloth?

05:09.691 --> 05:11.091
What? No. No washcloth.

05:11.092 --> 05:12.839
How about you, Joseph?

05:12.840 --> 05:15.204
Actually, yeah, I would..
I'd love a washcloth.

05:15.205 --> 05:18.010
No, Mom, sit. What the hell?
What the hell is happening?

05:20.040 --> 05:21.605
My mom reminds me of Blanka.

05:21.606 --> 05:24.246
That's the sound I hear
whenever she speaks.

05:24.247 --> 05:26.479
Just the gibberish
of an undisciplined animal.

05:26.480 --> 05:27.970
It's never going to end.
Even when I'm

05:27.971 --> 05:30.599
an adult, she'll find me,
question me.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.161
You're being a little
dramatic, I think.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.164
Joe, they're giving me hives.

05:35.165 --> 05:37.367
There's no way
that they can give you hives.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.479
Holy shit.

05:41.480 --> 05:42.720
Hey, kiddo.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.322
Round two. Fight!!

05:56.360 --> 05:58.761
- What, Dad?
- Should be a stud here.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.639
Oh, what's all this?

06:11.640 --> 06:13.163
Carol's going to be here in 30.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.002
- Go wash up.
- Uh, Dad, you know, um,

06:15.003 --> 06:17.001
I actually just realized
I have a party tonight,

06:17.002 --> 06:18.805
so I'm not going to be
able to make it

06:18.806 --> 06:20.165
for dinner and stuff.

06:20.166 --> 06:21.519
Sorry.

06:21.520 --> 06:22.999
Too bad.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.399
The plans are already made.

06:24.400 --> 06:25.890
Your sister's driving
all the way in.

06:25.891 --> 06:27.119
I'm making lamb stew.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.599
Are we in Beowulf?

06:28.600 --> 06:30.599
Look, after dinner,

06:30.600 --> 06:34.559
I was thinking
we might bring back Game Night.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.799
It'll be fun.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.599
Game.. Game Night's
a family thing, Dad.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.602
I'm not going to play Game Night
with some spider woman

06:41.603 --> 06:43.359
you found in the gutter.

06:43.360 --> 06:46.123
Carol is not a spider woman
that I found in the gutter, Joe.

06:46.124 --> 06:49.169
She's a very nice lady
who happens to like me.

06:49.170 --> 06:50.924
And I like her.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.882
So, we haven't played Game Night

06:54.883 --> 06:56.562
since Mom died, and then,

06:56.563 --> 06:59.484
all of a sudden, you meet
some floozy and expect..

06:59.485 --> 07:01.359
Enough!! Enough, Joe.

07:01.360 --> 07:03.159
This is not a debate.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.959
My house, my rules.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.450
Now, go get ready.

07:10.920 --> 07:12.522
So, Joe, your dad told me

07:12.523 --> 07:13.759
that you go to Tottenville.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.719
Are you on any teams?

07:15.720 --> 07:18.599
Carol, before we go any further,

07:18.600 --> 07:20.039
you should know...

07:20.040 --> 07:21.642
Frank is not my real father.

07:21.643 --> 07:23.482
I love him,
and I owe him a lot.

07:23.483 --> 07:25.448
You know,
he's very special to me,

07:25.449 --> 07:27.639
but he's not my blood.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.039
Is that true, Frank?

07:29.040 --> 07:30.530
That's completely untrue.

07:30.531 --> 07:32.199
I'm taking Ventnor.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.959
Frank, the lamb was delicious.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.919
Just so tender and..

07:37.920 --> 07:40.959
It was like I was
chewing avocado meat.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.531
I'm not sure I know
what you're saying, Colin.

07:43.532 --> 07:45.409
Avocado meat.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.999
Heather, do you remember
when Dad quit because, um,

07:52.000 --> 07:53.919
you wouldn't trade him B&O?

07:53.920 --> 07:55.842
- Remember that?
- Oh.. oh, do I remember

07:55.843 --> 07:58.719
when my own father called me
a "fear-mongering Chinaman?"

07:58.720 --> 08:00.210
Yeah, I do... mostly
'cause I'm not a man.

08:00.211 --> 08:02.079
Nor am I Chinese, so..

08:02.080 --> 08:03.599
Oh, my God, what a panic.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.931
That's something
my great-grandfather would say.

08:04.932 --> 08:06.160
He's a racist.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.599
You do that often?

08:09.600 --> 08:11.485
Eat the hamburger
and then the fries?

08:11.486 --> 08:12.891
You don't..
You don't mix it up?

08:13.920 --> 08:15.559
I don't know, Dad.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.199
Just asking.

08:17.200 --> 08:18.723
We watched a very good movie

08:18.724 --> 08:20.003
on the cable last night.

08:20.004 --> 08:21.602
- Mmm.
- Oh, honey, what was it called?

08:21.603 --> 08:22.831
It had that guy
in it, that actor..

08:22.920 --> 08:23.967
- What was it?
- What's his name?

08:23.968 --> 08:25.445
Called, uh, Heimlich, the..

08:25.446 --> 08:27.122
Yes, yes!! With, uh,
what's-his-name.

08:27.123 --> 08:29.407
The Prince,
the.. the New Prince.

08:29.408 --> 08:31.439
Will Smith?

08:31.440 --> 08:33.159
Will!! Yes. Will Prince.

08:33.159 --> 08:34.761
- Will Prince.
- Oh, my gosh, what does he play?

08:34.763 --> 08:36.364
- Superhero? -Oh, he plays
a superhero in this one.

08:36.365 --> 08:38.441
Kind of a supe..
Not a cape, though.

08:38.442 --> 08:41.489
- Yeah, it's called Heimlich.
- The darnedest thing.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.805
Come on.

08:46.800 --> 08:48.290
You want to be my buddy?

08:49.280 --> 08:51.319
Yes. I would love that.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.965
Tennessee for Park Place.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.007
Right now, straight up.

08:54.008 --> 08:55.839
Done.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.279
You got it.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.361
What? No.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:59.362 --> 09:02.602
- The men are talking, Joseph.
Pipe down. -COLIN: Yes. Quiet.

09:02.603 --> 09:04.682
Quiet, everybody,
except for the men.

09:04.683 --> 09:08.919
- We're in command of the room.
- This is bullshit, Dad.

09:08.920 --> 09:11.446
You're pricing me
out of the goddamn game.

09:11.447 --> 09:13.159
Your roll, JoJo.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.439
This is collusion.

09:14.440 --> 09:15.879
Dad, come on.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.405
Yeah, it's
kind of cruel, Frank.

09:17.406 --> 09:18.999
No, no.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.001
He's just mad because he
doesn't want to be here,

09:21.002 --> 09:22.240
so he's being a little shit.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.806
- Oh, great.
- Oh, no.

09:28.807 --> 09:30.399
Joe, don't go.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.528
He's quitting.
That's nice work, Dad.

09:32.529 --> 09:33.919
He'll be all right.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.331
Let him walk it off.

09:41.200 --> 09:45.199
Patrick, have you been
washing that foot every day?

09:45.200 --> 09:49.599
Because moisture can get trapped
in there from the brace.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.045
That's what killed
Jim Henson, you know.

09:51.046 --> 09:52.405
Oh..

09:53.800 --> 09:55.279
What the hell
are we talking about?

09:55.280 --> 09:56.520
Ooh, Patrick, can you whistle?

10:01.240 --> 10:03.524
I like it when you harmonize
with me on the whistling.

10:03.525 --> 10:05.682
- Patty, where you going?
- Got to go potty?

10:07.040 --> 10:08.279
Oh, shit, he's doing it.

10:08.280 --> 10:09.327
Joe!!

10:13.200 --> 10:15.159
Joe!!

10:15.160 --> 10:16.599
Joe..

10:16.600 --> 10:17.965
Yeah, I'd like
to report a theft.

10:17.966 --> 10:18.959
Goddamn it!!

10:18.960 --> 10:21.079
Yeah, his name is Frank Toy.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.959
Brown hair, uh, height unknown.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.008
I'll call you back.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.279
You son of a bitch.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.282
But..

10:36.560 --> 10:39.119
The problem with Joseph's habit

10:39.120 --> 10:41.361
is that one day there will be
an actual emergency

10:41.362 --> 10:43.681
or violent crime
coming from this house.

10:43.682 --> 10:46.719
Yeah, well,
the night is still young.

10:46.720 --> 10:50.441
Uh, Mr. Toy, are you familiar
with "The Boy Who Cried Wolf"?

10:50.442 --> 10:54.439
Yes. I experienced a childhood
on the planet Earth, so..

10:54.440 --> 10:56.362
Yes, I've heard of that one.

10:56.363 --> 10:58.966
Do you think you can
apply it to my situation

10:58.967 --> 11:00.799
in an allegorical fashion?

11:00.800 --> 11:02.839
Okay. It's a..

11:02.840 --> 11:05.241
- a story that involves
a boy who.. -Ah, ah, ah..

11:05.242 --> 11:07.359
- constantly cries "wolf."
Stop.

11:07.360 --> 11:09.408
And when the wolf finally
comes.. He doesn't know it.

11:09.409 --> 11:11.448
- I'm sorry, "The Boy
Who Cried" what? -Wolf.

11:11.449 --> 11:13.959
- Fuck you.
- Let's go.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.084
- "The Boy Who Cried" what?
- Stop talking.

11:16.085 --> 11:17.725
- Wolf.
- Get the fuck off my porch

11:17.726 --> 11:19.684
before I knock your dick
in the dirt.

11:19.685 --> 11:22.639
- Come on, let's go. -I don't see
what the problem was.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.080
- Why are you yelling at me?
- What's next? Three Little Pigs?

11:26.520 --> 11:28.405
It gets easier.
Okay? Honest. I swear.

11:28.406 --> 11:30.162
Look at it this way:
In two years,

11:30.163 --> 11:31.969
he's going to pay
for you to leave.

11:31.970 --> 11:34.719
Yeah.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.639
Uh, look,
this may sound desperate,

11:37.640 --> 11:40.199
but I am 100% lucid, okay?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.483
Don't smile, 'cause I'm..

11:41.484 --> 11:43.125
- Don't.
- No, this is very serious.

11:43.126 --> 11:45.282
- I am serious.
- I'm taking you so seriously.

11:45.283 --> 11:47.439
I can be packed in 15 minutes.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.079
Just take me with you
to Granville.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.639
Please.

11:51.640 --> 11:53.479
Okay, I would.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.439
Totally would, but..

11:55.440 --> 11:58.410
Dad would want to come
visit us all the time,

11:58.411 --> 12:00.879
and that just
wouldn't work for me.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.679
- You're lame.
- So..

12:02.680 --> 12:05.359
Take it easy on him.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.681
- You're getting so handsome.
- Yeah. Yeah.

12:07.682 --> 12:09.444
- I love you.
- Hey, don't you touch me.

12:09.445 --> 12:11.408
You love it.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.759
Oh, hey. Hey.

12:54.760 --> 12:57.331
- What's up? -Okay, I am
going to get you a beer

12:57.332 --> 12:58.719
so you can catch up.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.563
Okay.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.283
Chug!! Chug!! Chug!! Chug!!

13:04.284 --> 13:06.089
Chug!! Chug!! Chug!! Chug!! Chug!!

13:15.520 --> 13:17.043
- What's up, dude?
- Hey.

13:17.044 --> 13:18.690
How was, uh, fake family night?

13:18.691 --> 13:19.919
Oh, it was great.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.159
Nothing went wrong.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.446
The police didn't come.

13:22.447 --> 13:23.759
I love my father.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.285
Shit.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.281
- Okay, I have beer for you.
- Hey. Thank you.

13:30.282 --> 13:32.005
- Hello. Hello.
- Hello, Kelly.

13:32.006 --> 13:33.762
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

13:33.763 --> 13:35.524
I'm not as drunk as you are.

13:35.525 --> 13:36.759
I think you are.

13:36.760 --> 13:38.166
- Can I have your beer?
- No.

13:38.167 --> 13:40.242
Hey, sorry, bro.
Keg's almost tapped.

13:40.243 --> 13:41.759
No beer for freshmen.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.603
Oh, but he is
a sophomore now, Paul.

13:43.604 --> 13:45.079
Sorry, babe.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.879
No dice, bro.

13:46.880 --> 13:48.959
Oh, man.

13:48.960 --> 13:52.039
You little fuck-suckers!!

13:52.040 --> 13:53.799
We're trying to sleep!!

13:53.800 --> 13:55.529
It's public property, bro!!

13:55.530 --> 13:56.759
What?

13:56.760 --> 13:58.719
Who told you that?

13:58.720 --> 14:00.722
We assumed!!

14:02.240 --> 14:04.004
I don't trust that old guy.

14:04.005 --> 14:06.599
He has a shadow
behind his eyes.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.126
How long have you
been standing there?

14:09.127 --> 14:10.559
Hello.

14:10.560 --> 14:12.130
That's not an answer.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.206
You little shit dicks!!

14:17.720 --> 14:19.802
- Oh, my..
- Jesus!! Let's go, let's go.

14:23.760 --> 14:25.841
What the hell
are you doing, guys? Come on!!

14:25.842 --> 14:28.124
- Oh, my God!! Oh, my God!!
- Let's go!! Let's go!!

14:28.125 --> 14:30.521
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

14:32.160 --> 14:33.842
Hey, Joe, do you know we've been

14:33.843 --> 14:35.246
walking for half a mile?

14:35.247 --> 14:37.083
I can tell
by how much we've bonded.

14:37.084 --> 14:39.319
Well, we're lost, and, um..

14:39.320 --> 14:41.891
You haven't said a word
this entire time, so..

14:41.892 --> 14:43.719
How much longer?

14:43.720 --> 14:45.679
I have no idea, Biaggio.

14:45.680 --> 14:50.129
Let's just keep our wits,
and we'll get out of here.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.804
Where are we?

15:31.560 --> 15:33.961
Someplace they won't find you.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.687
What?

15:46.920 --> 15:49.399
Let's go, man.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.165
We got a long walk home.

16:12.520 --> 16:13.919
Hello? Hi.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.199
Hi.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.279
I just wanted to make sure

16:17.280 --> 16:19.408
that you didn't
get shot last night.

16:19.409 --> 16:20.879
No. No, no, no.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.719
I survived.

16:22.720 --> 16:25.087
I, uh, wound up getting stuck
with that kid Biaggio, though.

16:25.088 --> 16:27.319
Oh, yeah, I spoke to him once.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.919
He told me that his uncle died
on the Challenger.

16:30.920 --> 16:34.599
That's the price
of space travel, right?

16:34.600 --> 16:36.199
Uh.. yeah, sure.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.999
Um, so get ready for this.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.082
Paul skedaddled on me
last night.

16:42.083 --> 16:45.050
Uh, wow, that's..
That's a dick move.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.482
Tools... out of the driveway now.

16:48.483 --> 16:50.162
- I'm on the phone.
- Oh.

16:50.163 --> 16:51.725
I don't give a shit.
Right now.

16:51.726 --> 16:53.006
Is everything okay there?

16:53.007 --> 16:55.079
- No!!
- Who is this? Patrick?

16:55.080 --> 16:57.999
- Kelly.
- Kelly. A girl.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.763
- Jesus, that's
a pleasant surprise. -Dad..

17:00.764 --> 17:04.002
Listen, Kelly, Joe can't talk
right now because he's grounded.

17:04.002 --> 17:06.001
He will call you back sometime

17:06.002 --> 17:08.445
before his hot new bedtime
of 7:30.

17:08.446 --> 17:09.999
You have a good night.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.398
Okay.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.279
Tools. Now.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.324
And if they're ruined,
you're going to work

17:15.325 --> 17:17.049
the whole set off
this summer. I mean it.

17:17.050 --> 17:18.679
A paper route.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.165
Big Chief Indian Corn.

17:20.165 --> 17:22.242
Goddamn Ohio Soccer Jazz.
I don't care.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.358
You have your pick.

17:24.359 --> 17:26.169
This bullshit ends today.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.042
Yes, it does.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.843
I can't walk
all day like this, Joe.

17:37.844 --> 17:39.330
Okay.
We're almost there.

17:39.331 --> 17:40.839
Just 50 yards.

17:40.840 --> 17:42.159
Almost where?

17:42.160 --> 17:43.399
What the hell
could you be showing me

17:43.400 --> 17:44.686
in the woods right now?

17:48.920 --> 17:50.399
What is this, Joe?

17:50.400 --> 17:52.323
You want your room
facing sunrise or sunset?

17:52.324 --> 17:53.599
My What?!!

17:53.600 --> 17:55.762
This is the site
of our new house, man.

17:55.763 --> 17:57.399
What, like a tree house?

17:57.400 --> 17:58.806
No, like a real house.

17:58.807 --> 18:01.039
I'm moving out.
We're moving out.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.451
What the hell are
you talking about?

18:02.452 --> 18:03.679
My mom won't let me walk

18:03.680 --> 18:05.239
around the house
without socks on.

18:05.240 --> 18:06.651
She's definitely
not going to let us

18:06.652 --> 18:08.003
live out here in the woods.

18:08.004 --> 18:10.124
No one will
find us out here, Patrick.

18:10.125 --> 18:12.201
This house,
this land, it's ours!!

18:12.202 --> 18:13.770
We make the rules, you know?

18:13.771 --> 18:15.639
Like men!!

18:15.640 --> 18:17.641
So we're just going
to move out here

18:17.642 --> 18:19.961
and, uh, build a house
from scratch?

18:19.962 --> 18:21.004
How hard can it be?

18:21.005 --> 18:22.570
Hold on... what is this kid

18:22.571 --> 18:24.319
doing here?

18:24.320 --> 18:25.839
I don't know.

18:25.840 --> 18:27.565
I'm afraid to tell him to leave.

18:27.566 --> 18:29.847
I don't know
what he's capable of.

18:29.848 --> 18:31.519
Forget him.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.165
Break ground with me, man.

18:33.166 --> 18:36.004
Look, I'm sorry, Joe,
but I can't do this.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.043
Call me when you get home.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.323
Patrick?

18:50.280 --> 18:52.165
So you wore
the blue shirt today?

18:52.166 --> 18:53.810
Not the one with the pocket?

18:55.320 --> 18:57.321
- He's got the blue one on.
- Yeah.

18:57.322 --> 18:59.439
Whoa, rope in
the attitude, mister.

18:59.440 --> 19:00.771
This is your mother
you're speaking to.

19:00.772 --> 19:02.724
- Come on, buddy. Come on.
- Huh? Huh?

19:02.725 --> 19:05.199
- My word. -Sorry, Dad.
- Who is he doing a show for?

19:05.200 --> 19:06.565
Oh, my gosh, I know,
it's like he's on camera.

19:06.566 --> 19:08.003
Are there girls around?

19:08.004 --> 19:09.650
Yeah, there must be. Uh-oh.

19:09.651 --> 19:11.159
Girl check.

19:11.160 --> 19:12.650
Checking for a girl in a bikini.

19:12.651 --> 19:16.399
- Nope. I don't see one.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.243
Those hormones are a-ragin'.

19:26.360 --> 19:27.359
Hello?

19:27.360 --> 19:29.239
I'm in.

19:29.240 --> 19:30.999
- What?
- The house.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.119
I'll do it.

19:32.120 --> 19:34.079
Yes!! Yes!! Holy shit!! Yes!!

19:34.080 --> 19:35.599
Okay. Awesome.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.409
Well, we'll break ground
tomorrow.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.289
Yeah, right.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.888
Hello?

20:09.080 --> 20:13.163
Joe, what do you tell your dad
when you leave all the time?

20:13.164 --> 20:15.606
If we were talking, I still
wouldn't tell him shit.

20:15.607 --> 20:18.599
Jesus, what happened
between you two?

20:18.600 --> 20:20.679
Nothing.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.879
He's just an old, lonely prick,

20:22.880 --> 20:24.562
and I want to get out of there

20:24.563 --> 20:26.369
before I end up
anything like him.

20:26.370 --> 20:28.359
Joe?

20:28.360 --> 20:30.249
Can I talk to you for a second?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.239
- You made this?
- I did.

20:38.240 --> 20:39.959
Took very little time.

20:39.960 --> 20:42.327
Very few days.

20:45.400 --> 20:50.406
"My name is Jamal Colorado,
and I have kidnapped your son.

20:51.080 --> 20:54.479
"He is unharmed,
and will stay that way

20:54.480 --> 20:57.239
if you abide by
the following rules."

20:57.240 --> 20:59.559
"Jamal Colorado"?

20:59.560 --> 21:01.528
"Anfernee Texas"?

21:02.600 --> 21:03.919
"D'Sean Utah"?

21:03.920 --> 21:05.081
Yeah, I decided on the format

21:05.082 --> 21:06.559
of Denzel Washington:

21:06.560 --> 21:08.881
a black first name,
followed by a state.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.882
Yeah, fuck that.
We're not using those.

21:12.883 --> 21:14.239
Okay, Biaggio,

21:14.240 --> 21:15.479
good effort..

21:15.480 --> 21:16.322
Although very poorly
planned out

21:16.323 --> 21:17.999
and, um..

21:18.000 --> 21:20.399
Savagely racist.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.721
I just didn't want
to do nothing.

21:39.920 --> 21:43.479
Dad, um..

21:43.480 --> 21:45.881
I'm gonna spend the night
at Patrick's tonight,

21:45.882 --> 21:47.479
if that's okay.

21:47.480 --> 21:50.290
Okay, and make sure
you're in bed by 7:30.

21:50.291 --> 21:52.248
I'll call the Keenans.

24:02.480 --> 24:05.245
Freedom!!

24:10.880 --> 24:14.123
Fuck you, Frank!!

24:17.320 --> 24:18.922
Honey, I got
the classic ciabatta bread.

24:18.923 --> 24:20.570
- They finally had it.
- You're getting wild.

24:20.571 --> 24:21.999
- Sliced.
- Yeah.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.639
- This is our big day.
- You're crazy.

24:23.640 --> 24:24.687
We usually do rustic ciabatta.

24:24.688 --> 24:26.439
I know it.

24:26.440 --> 24:29.523
Mom, Dad, I'm going to spend
the night at Joe's.

24:29.524 --> 24:31.319
Oh, okay, honey.

24:31.320 --> 24:32.805
Well, I already made
dinner, though,

24:32.806 --> 24:35.371
so take some vegetable soup
for you and Joe.

24:35.372 --> 24:36.879
Uh, no, thanks.

24:36.880 --> 24:38.450
No one likes
vegetable soup, Mom.

24:38.451 --> 24:40.159
Well..

24:40.160 --> 24:42.284
Okay, we're
in Pretendland, I guess.

24:42.285 --> 24:44.042
"Nobody likes
vegetable soup."

24:44.043 --> 24:45.724
- Did you hear this, honey?
- I heard it.

24:45.725 --> 24:47.003
- Oh, my God.
- He's your son.

24:47.004 --> 24:48.363
Listen, tell Mr. Toy

24:48.364 --> 24:49.885
to put some white rice
underneath it.

24:49.886 --> 24:51.041
It'll be delightful.

24:51.042 --> 24:52.239
Mom, no.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.599
No vegetable soup.

24:53.600 --> 24:55.123
We're not eating vegetable soup.

24:55.124 --> 24:56.451
I'm getting a Tupperware.

24:56.452 --> 24:58.204
Here, take this tomato.

25:14.360 --> 25:16.328
Jesus.

25:45.560 --> 25:46.959
You okay, fatty?

25:46.960 --> 25:48.199
No.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.519
No, I'm not.

25:49.520 --> 25:50.723
I-I'm really nervous.

25:50.724 --> 25:52.085
We're really doing this, huh?

25:52.086 --> 25:54.959
Yes, we are.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.882
I've never done
anything like this, Joe.

25:56.883 --> 25:58.245
It's starting to freak me out.

25:58.246 --> 26:00.439
Well, uh, neither have I.

26:00.440 --> 26:02.359
Kind of the point.

26:02.360 --> 26:04.399
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.199
Just, okay, before I make

26:06.200 --> 26:07.799
a big decision,

26:07.800 --> 26:09.562
I always, you know,
say to myself,

26:09.563 --> 26:11.365
"I'll do it unless God gives me

26:11.366 --> 26:13.408
a definitive omen
in the next 30 seconds."

26:13.409 --> 26:14.959
So, you know,

26:14.960 --> 26:16.564
it's just some
dumb superstition I have.

26:16.565 --> 26:18.847
If you don't want
to do it, that's fine.

26:18.848 --> 26:20.199
But..

26:20.200 --> 26:21.399
Do you want to?

26:21.400 --> 26:22.999
Sure, yeah.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.759
It's..

26:24.760 --> 26:27.843
Yeah, so just like,
close your eyes, and yeah.

26:27.844 --> 26:29.649
You got it.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.399
Oh.

26:39.400 --> 26:40.799
Okay, let's go.

26:40.800 --> 26:41.959
Wait, what?

26:41.960 --> 26:43.759
No, no, that was thunder.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.043
Definitely a bad omen.

26:45.044 --> 26:46.642
No, come on, that was thunder.

26:46.643 --> 26:48.525
That's a tree.
This is a rock.

26:48.526 --> 26:50.170
Come on, man, it's nature.

26:50.171 --> 26:52.079
It's not an omen.

26:52.080 --> 26:53.479
Have some common sense.

26:53.480 --> 26:54.970
- "Common sense"?
- It's not like a raven

26:54.971 --> 26:56.399
told us to go away.

26:56.400 --> 26:57.970
Yeah, we're doing this.

27:22.880 --> 27:25.087
Oh, God.

27:34.240 --> 27:36.599
Ready?

27:36.600 --> 27:38.443
All right, let's unpack.

27:45.800 --> 27:47.319
I came early.

27:47.320 --> 27:48.599
Oh, shit.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.719
Dude.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.722
Oh, my God.

28:49.760 --> 28:52.525
Fuck, yeah.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.402
Patrick.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.279
What the f..? Jesus.

29:14.280 --> 29:16.244
- What time is it, man?
- Who cares?

29:16.245 --> 29:17.566
We're out in the woods.

29:17.567 --> 29:19.003
There's no time in the woods.

29:19.004 --> 29:20.161
Let's go exploring.

29:20.162 --> 29:21.799
- What?
- What?

29:21.800 --> 29:24.164
Of course there's
time in the woods.

29:24.165 --> 29:25.965
You go outside
and you look at the..

29:25.966 --> 29:28.244
The sun, and the higher
it is in the sky,

29:28.245 --> 29:29.890
the later it is in the day.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.279
"We do swear,

30:32.280 --> 30:34.408
"under pain of friendship lost,

30:34.409 --> 30:36.079
"to never speak

30:36.080 --> 30:38.284
"of this enterprise
to any adult,

30:38.285 --> 30:40.089
"and to never betray
its location

30:40.090 --> 30:42.599
"or its participants,

30:42.600 --> 30:45.079
"and from this day forthwith

30:45.080 --> 30:46.605
"to boil our own water,

30:46.606 --> 30:49.599
"kill our own food,
build our own shelter

30:49.600 --> 30:51.887
and be our own men."

30:56.520 --> 30:59.086
All right, we need cool names
for everything.

30:59.087 --> 31:01.124
Like, awesome, mythical names.

31:01.125 --> 31:02.643
- No, we don't.
- Or, uh..

31:02.644 --> 31:04.051
The Trees of Destiny.

31:04.052 --> 31:05.799
Oh!!

31:05.800 --> 31:07.239
- No.
- No!! The map!!

31:07.240 --> 31:09.004
Aah!!

31:12.360 --> 31:14.479
- So, Patrick's a wrestler?
- Oh, very good one.

31:14.480 --> 31:15.970
- Yes, a good one.
- Very good wrestler.

31:15.971 --> 31:18.327
So what's that,
Greco-Roman or arena?

31:18.328 --> 31:19.559
Don't answer that.

31:19.560 --> 31:21.679
Greco-Roman. What's arena?

31:21.680 --> 31:23.119
Arena is pro.

31:23.120 --> 31:25.201
Do you think
that Joe would run away

31:25.202 --> 31:27.202
- to prove a point?
- Oh, hold on now.

31:27.203 --> 31:29.959
We don't know
that they've run away.

31:29.960 --> 31:31.961
I mean, there is
absolutely no reason

31:31.962 --> 31:33.439
that Patrick would run away.

31:33.440 --> 31:34.601
Not for Patrick to run away, no.

31:34.602 --> 31:35.803
- Okay.
- You're right.

31:35.804 --> 31:37.445
It's a classic kidnapping.

31:37.446 --> 31:39.804
They took our children
and the canned goods and pasta.

31:39.805 --> 31:42.004
All right, look,
I hate to admit it,

31:42.005 --> 31:44.401
but Frank is right.
Right now, we have to assume

31:44.402 --> 31:46.323
that these
are voluntary disappearances.

31:46.324 --> 31:49.879
Wow. What do you know?

31:49.880 --> 31:54.044
The police, always pushing
their pig Irish agendas.

31:54.960 --> 31:56.079
Whoa.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.319
Mrs. Keenan,
I assure you,

31:57.320 --> 31:58.603
there is no other agenda

31:58.604 --> 32:00.006
than to find your son right now.

32:00.007 --> 32:01.968
No. The Irish
are the blacks of Europe.

32:01.969 --> 32:03.959
The blacks of Europe.

32:03.960 --> 32:05.439
- Oh, my God.
- Period.

32:05.440 --> 32:06.851
- That's powerful stuff.
- That's not..

32:06.852 --> 32:08.239
Okay, wow.

32:08.240 --> 32:10.082
Sweetheart, I'm Irish, okay?

32:10.083 --> 32:11.922
We're under a lot
of stress, Captain.

32:11.923 --> 32:13.123
I'm sorry about..

32:13.124 --> 32:15.441
You know Patrick
was our only boy.

32:15.442 --> 32:16.965
"Is."
- Did you know that?

32:16.966 --> 32:18.599
- Yes, I do.
- Did you?

32:18.600 --> 32:19.839
I'm well aware.

32:19.840 --> 32:22.119
Listen, according
to the report,

32:22.120 --> 32:23.679
$80 to $100 in food

32:23.680 --> 32:24.761
and housewares is missing.

32:24.762 --> 32:26.719
From the Toy house,

32:26.720 --> 32:28.359
we are down a tool set,

32:28.360 --> 32:31.239
grill utensils
and about $240 in cash.

32:31.240 --> 32:33.447
Now, I presume
we're not pressing charges.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.679
Frank, would you like

32:39.680 --> 32:41.603
to press charges against Joe?

32:43.840 --> 32:46.279
Not at this time.

32:46.280 --> 32:47.805
He took the Monopoly, too.

32:47.806 --> 32:49.319
Obviously to spite me.

32:49.320 --> 32:50.481
Maybe he just wanted

32:50.482 --> 32:52.130
something to remember you by.

32:52.131 --> 32:53.719
No way.

32:53.720 --> 32:55.927
He hates that damn game.
Did you see him the other night?

32:55.928 --> 32:58.204
Well, he used to love it,
you know,

32:58.205 --> 32:59.925
when it was, like,
the four of us.

32:59.926 --> 33:03.045
You're kind of shitting
on his memories, Dad.

33:03.046 --> 33:05.164
Well, what am I
supposed to do, Heather?

33:05.165 --> 33:06.446
You know, if I died, he'd get

33:06.447 --> 33:08.479
over it in about six weeks.

33:08.480 --> 33:11.199
Uh, sir, Chinese food is here,

33:11.200 --> 33:12.770
so I would like to actually..

33:12.771 --> 33:14.639
How much?

33:14.640 --> 33:16.279
Uh, it's $51.

33:16.280 --> 33:17.679
$51?

33:17.680 --> 33:19.485
What the hell did you order?
Heather?

33:19.486 --> 33:21.125
Don't look at me.
I got dumplings.

33:21.126 --> 33:22.201
I'm not even hungry.

33:22.202 --> 33:23.882
Yeah, I actually ordered a..

33:23.883 --> 33:26.446
A large portion of the shrimp
with lobster sauce.

33:26.447 --> 33:28.042
I figured it was pretty neutral.

33:28.043 --> 33:29.525
We can eat it family-style.

33:29.526 --> 33:30.846
- Neutral?
- Mm-hmm.

33:30.847 --> 33:32.046
Shrimp with lobster sauce?

33:32.047 --> 33:33.159
Yeah.

33:33.160 --> 33:34.879
I can't think

33:34.880 --> 33:37.611
of a more marginal dish
in any culture.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.399
- Hi.
- Hey.

33:40.400 --> 33:43.279
What's your name?

33:43.280 --> 33:44.882
My American name is Gary.

33:44.883 --> 33:46.803
You ever have one
of those days, Gary?

33:46.804 --> 33:48.159
What kind of days?

33:48.160 --> 33:49.799
The kind I'm having right now.

33:49.800 --> 33:51.564
I don't know what kind
of day you're having.

33:51.565 --> 33:52.966
Where you feel like somebody

33:52.967 --> 33:54.525
is pissing in your face
all day long.

33:54.526 --> 33:55.646
Is that good or bad?

33:57.240 --> 33:58.479
- Bad.
- Bad.

33:58.480 --> 34:00.999
Gary,

34:01.000 --> 34:02.159
every time..

34:02.160 --> 34:03.603
You see those wontons, Gary?

34:03.604 --> 34:05.165
- You see the size of them?
- Mm-hmm.

34:05.166 --> 34:07.359
Those wontons are too big,
my friend.

34:07.360 --> 34:09.408
Everybody loves those.
People ask us for the recipe.

34:09.409 --> 34:11.079
We won't provide it.

34:11.080 --> 34:12.969
It's part of our training...
how to deal with people

34:12.969 --> 34:14.478
who want the recipe too bad.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.083
- Oh? -We have a phrase
we have to repeat.

34:16.085 --> 34:18.081
- What is that?
- "We won't provide it."

34:18.081 --> 34:19.679
I can see the value
of these now.

34:19.679 --> 34:21.681
I can have the kids
from the neighborhood come over

34:21.683 --> 34:24.399
and bounce up and down on them
at a fucking party.

34:24.400 --> 34:26.447
- Oh, sarcasm, I get it.
- It's like a bouncy house.

34:26.449 --> 34:27.839
The poor man's wit.

34:27.840 --> 34:29.762
My question for you, Gary, is:

34:29.763 --> 34:33.481
How do you want me to eat these
with my normal human mouth?

34:33.482 --> 34:36.402
Do you want me to unhinge my jaw
like an anaconda?

34:36.402 --> 34:39.199
Should I put this in my belly
and lay out in the sun

34:39.199 --> 34:41.282
- for two months, digesting it?
- Dad, enough!! My God!!

34:41.283 --> 34:43.759
- Just pay the poor guy.
- My God. Yeah, and maybe

34:43.760 --> 34:45.405
you should get
some forks in the house

34:45.406 --> 34:48.119
so your dad doesn't have
to unhinge his stupid jaw to..

34:48.120 --> 34:49.760
We're done here, and for
the record, your wontons

34:49.770 --> 34:51.476
are way too big.
Nobody can fucking eat those.

34:51.487 --> 34:53.130
No, I can eat them;
just give them to me.

34:53.130 --> 34:55.851
- Good night, Gary.
- I'd be very happy to eat those.

34:55.851 --> 34:58.119
Your house has a bad vibe.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.559
No more rice,

34:59.560 --> 35:00.919
no more pasta.

35:00.920 --> 35:02.285
It's time to eat an honest meal.

35:02.286 --> 35:03.799
Biaggio?

35:03.800 --> 35:05.962
You and I will take
to the trees.

35:05.963 --> 35:07.279
Patrick,

35:07.280 --> 35:09.039
you, uh..

35:09.040 --> 35:10.399
Yeah, yeah, I know.

35:10.400 --> 35:11.765
I-I pick berries and apples

35:11.766 --> 35:13.199
and forage.

35:13.200 --> 35:14.770
And it makes a lot
of sense, yeah.

35:16.360 --> 35:18.159
Oh, what?

35:18.160 --> 35:21.050
You should be the hunter
just because you're stronger?

35:21.051 --> 35:22.166
Yeah.

35:28.440 --> 35:30.559
Oh, don't..

35:30.560 --> 35:31.923
Don't drink the water.

35:31.924 --> 35:33.645
Uh-uh,
I shouldn't have done that.

35:33.646 --> 35:34.926
I'm glad you came out, Biaggio.

35:34.927 --> 35:36.399
I mean, this is..

35:36.400 --> 35:38.084
This is our rite
of passage, goddamn it.

35:38.085 --> 35:39.399
Have you ever felt

35:39.400 --> 35:41.959
this at one with..
With yourself?

35:41.960 --> 35:43.724
With your instincts,
with nature?

35:43.725 --> 35:45.719
This..

35:45.720 --> 35:47.199
This masculine?

35:47.200 --> 35:49.639
I don't know.

35:49.640 --> 35:53.559
I don't really see myself
as having a gender.

35:53.560 --> 35:57.199
Is that a problem?

35:57.200 --> 35:59.199
It's not great.

35:59.200 --> 36:02.363
This way to the bison,
my friend.

36:05.320 --> 36:06.839
When you get up here,

36:06.840 --> 36:08.205
you can see a field of bison

36:08.206 --> 36:10.799
majestically grazing.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.529
Ooh, get your weapon ready.

36:12.530 --> 36:14.522
- Yeah.

36:21.360 --> 36:22.521
Let's go, Biaggio.
Come on.

36:22.522 --> 36:23.719
No, but the..

36:23.720 --> 36:25.799
The quarter dark is so good.

36:25.800 --> 36:27.919
Boston Market, that's..

36:27.920 --> 36:31.239
That's from our old life,

36:31.240 --> 36:33.368
our weak life.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.521
Wait here.

36:48.360 --> 36:51.159
What will it attract...
scavengers?

36:51.160 --> 36:52.885
Scavengers?
Look at this.

36:52.886 --> 36:54.206
Fit for a goddamn king.

36:54.207 --> 36:56.441
Are there any bears
in these woods?

36:56.442 --> 36:59.159
Hope so.

36:59.160 --> 37:01.970
A bear would feed us
for a month.

37:06.720 --> 37:09.399
Perhaps we can disillusion him.

37:09.400 --> 37:10.845
A bear who doesn't believe
in anything

37:10.846 --> 37:13.047
will be easier to bring down.

37:14.760 --> 37:18.759
I.. I guess I agree with that.

37:18.760 --> 37:21.206
Might be a little small.

37:23.120 --> 37:25.691
One, two, three, four, five.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.842
You have a tag on your pants.

38:00.640 --> 38:02.924
Did you buy new clothes
for this?

38:02.925 --> 38:05.002
It comes like that...
it's the style.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.239
Yes!!

38:10.240 --> 38:11.799
Okay, come on.

38:11.800 --> 38:13.802
No, the swords.

38:15.800 --> 38:18.319
We got it.

38:18.320 --> 38:20.319
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:20.320 --> 38:21.919
Oh, God, okay.

38:21.920 --> 38:23.365
Flip, flip, flip the thing,

38:23.366 --> 38:26.079
and I'll, uh..
I'll take its life.

38:26.080 --> 38:27.650
Strike it at its neck.
Don't compromise the meat.

38:27.651 --> 38:29.641
- I know, I know.
- It may plead; don't listen.

38:29.642 --> 38:32.199
- Be cold, clinical
with the blade. -I will.

38:32.200 --> 38:33.281
It may try to bargain...
this is natural.

38:33.282 --> 38:34.281
- Just turn it!!
- Okay!!

38:44.000 --> 38:45.485
Yeah, I'm just surprised

38:45.486 --> 38:47.721
you found a live chicken
in these woods.

38:48.720 --> 38:50.927
Yup, yes, sir.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.359
That's amazing.

38:53.360 --> 38:54.359
Biaggio,

38:54.360 --> 38:58.079
your corn pudding is to die for.

38:58.080 --> 38:59.650
I have to know the recipe.

38:59.651 --> 39:01.290
Mmm.

39:06.880 --> 39:08.879
Oh, God.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.639
So smug.

39:10.640 --> 39:11.839
Dude,

39:11.840 --> 39:13.359
food attracts mice.

39:13.360 --> 39:14.599
And you know what mice attract?

39:14.600 --> 39:16.442
- Stupid fucking questions?
- No.

39:16.443 --> 39:17.521
They attract snakes.

39:17.522 --> 39:19.249
In Italian, the word for "snake"

39:19.250 --> 39:21.159
means "the demon's cock."

39:21.160 --> 39:23.364
- No, it doesn't. -There's
a chance that it doesn't.

39:23.365 --> 39:24.361
Whatever, dude.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.159
From here on out,

39:26.160 --> 39:29.205
- all the food goes either in the
fire or in the ground. -

39:29.206 --> 39:31.404
God, man, you're
so doom and gloom

39:31.405 --> 39:33.444
all the time.
Just enjoy this.

39:33.445 --> 39:35.005
It's not doom and gloom, bro.

39:35.006 --> 39:37.965
I just found a copperhead
skin two hours ago.

39:37.966 --> 39:40.281
I read once that animals
see fear as a color.

39:40.282 --> 39:41.930
I thought you can't read.

39:41.931 --> 39:43.919
No, I can read.

39:43.920 --> 39:46.239
I can't cry.

39:46.240 --> 39:49.289
Well, there you go.

39:52.680 --> 39:54.603
Okay, we traced
Joe and Patrick's cell phones

39:54.604 --> 39:55.599
to this bus.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.359
Savanovic, Dietzel,

39:57.360 --> 39:59.759
check under the seats,
see if the bathroom's locked.

39:59.760 --> 40:00.886
This is an artist's projection

40:00.887 --> 40:02.279
of what he might look like now.

40:02.280 --> 40:03.441
The beard may be a little full.

40:03.442 --> 40:05.199
They aren't here.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.611
This is a waste
of real time, Davis.

40:06.612 --> 40:09.439
You can check under
the bus if you want.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.042
There's not a lot of air

40:11.043 --> 40:13.041
that can make it
under there, but..

40:13.042 --> 40:15.319
Listen to me. Our son ran away
about eight years ago.

40:15.320 --> 40:17.288
- I'm sorry. Did he come back?
- So, he came back?

40:17.289 --> 40:21.639
- Well, it was a really hard time
for us. -Uh, thank you.

40:21.640 --> 40:23.606
Jesus, we don't need this
right now, sir. Are you okay?

40:23.607 --> 40:25.170
- Uh, what does he mean?
- He doesn't mean anything.

40:25.180 --> 40:26.741
- You need to lean on each other.
- Sir.

40:26.765 --> 40:28.879
- Oh, my God.
- Get him back on the bus.

40:28.880 --> 40:30.689
- Davis. -No, I don't want
to get on the bus.

40:30.690 --> 40:32.284
I'm a licensed therapist!!

40:32.285 --> 40:33.839
This is Joe's bag.

40:33.840 --> 40:36.320
It's empty-

40:37.920 --> 40:39.922
- That's Patrick's phone.
- That's Joe's.

40:39.923 --> 40:41.919
Some dude had a beeper?

40:41.920 --> 40:43.159
That's dope.

40:43.160 --> 40:45.359
W-Wait a minute.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.643
What.. what is that?

40:46.644 --> 40:47.926
What does that mean?

40:47.927 --> 40:49.839
It's a Monopoly piece.

40:49.840 --> 40:52.079
MY Piece.

40:52.080 --> 40:55.279
He's taunting me.

40:55.280 --> 40:56.962
He's like the Zodiac Killer.

40:56.963 --> 40:59.361
Okay, the worst thing you can do
is hope right now.

40:59.362 --> 41:00.805
I'm just letting you know.

41:14.360 --> 41:16.279
Hey!! Hey!! Hey!! Hey!!

41:16.280 --> 41:18.799
We have to do this for real.
Ready?

41:18.800 --> 41:21.849
One, two..
A-one, two, three, four!!

42:16.760 --> 42:18.444
Cheers.

42:25.840 --> 42:28.491
We have water, shelter.
We can put a balanced meal

42:28.492 --> 42:31.559
on the table.
I mean, we answer to no one.

42:31.560 --> 42:34.079
We're men.

42:34.080 --> 42:36.079
Just now?

42:36.080 --> 42:37.559
Just happened?

42:37.560 --> 42:39.399
Just happened, man.

42:39.400 --> 42:41.399
You don't say.

42:41.400 --> 42:43.767
All I'm saying
is that if anything

42:43.768 --> 42:45.888
was missing from all of this..

42:47.440 --> 42:49.719
..it'd be a woman's touch.

42:49.720 --> 42:51.919
We have Biaggio.

42:51.920 --> 42:54.571
Doesn't count.

42:58.160 --> 43:00.242
- Right here. Hey, hey, hey.
- Oh, what, what?

43:00.243 --> 43:01.519
Hey.

43:01.520 --> 43:03.488
- Hello.
- Got to get my drink on.

43:03.489 --> 43:05.599
Hi. Do you guys want anything?

43:05.600 --> 43:07.125
Uh, I got a Titleist right here.

43:07.126 --> 43:09.919
It's worth like $3.50,
so if I could get

43:09.920 --> 43:11.524
a Sun Chips and a beer
and then 50 cents

43:11.525 --> 43:12.965
in change,
that would be fantastic.

43:12.966 --> 43:15.804
Okay, well, we do not
run on a barter system.

43:17.120 --> 43:19.566
What the fuck
is a "barger" system?

43:19.567 --> 43:21.199
- Barter.
- Barger?

43:21.200 --> 43:23.166
When you use equal goods
or services instead of cash.

43:23.167 --> 43:24.683
So you admit that these
are equal goods

43:24.684 --> 43:25.919
- in your barger system.
- Yeah, but we

43:25.920 --> 43:27.203
do not run on a barter system.

43:27.204 --> 43:28.440
That's not the point.

43:47.320 --> 43:49.482
You're on the news, Joe.
Your dad was on K-19.

43:49.483 --> 43:51.079
Okay, please.

43:51.080 --> 43:54.159
My dad is loving
every second of this, okay?

43:54.160 --> 43:56.479
No, Joe, I seriously doubt that.

43:56.480 --> 43:57.891
So, uh..

43:59.640 --> 44:02.243
..does Patrick have a really
big, crazy beard now, too?

44:02.244 --> 44:04.527
Yeah, yeah, his is a little
more serious than mine.

44:04.528 --> 44:06.559
I have.. I have thin hair.

44:06.560 --> 44:07.971
You know, you have to groom it.

44:07.972 --> 44:09.279
Oh, right.

44:09.280 --> 44:11.959
Yeah, like Paul's
sick-ass goatee?

44:11.960 --> 44:13.999
Uh..

44:14.000 --> 44:16.759
I guess you wouldn't
have heard...

44:16.760 --> 44:19.199
Paul and I broke up.

44:19.200 --> 44:20.879
Oh.

44:20.880 --> 44:22.564
This isn't over, Kelly.

44:24.040 --> 44:25.929
This isn't over, Kelly!!

44:30.360 --> 44:33.603
Uh.. uh, no,
I did not catch wind of that.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.519
Um..

44:37.520 --> 44:38.965
I'm sorry, though.

44:40.880 --> 44:45.759
I, uh, came here actually
to invite you to dinner.

44:45.760 --> 44:48.799
Uh, sort of like a..
A housewarming thing.

44:48.800 --> 44:50.450
- If you want.
- Yeah, obviously I want to,

44:50.451 --> 44:52.204
but how do I..
How do I get there?

44:52.205 --> 44:53.439
Do I have to..

44:53.440 --> 44:55.085
Be blindfolded or something?

44:55.086 --> 44:56.965
In all seriousness, it's of

44:56.966 --> 45:00.085
absolute vital importance
that you not tell anyone,

45:00.086 --> 45:02.124
- not bring anyone. No one.
- Yes.

45:02.125 --> 45:04.327
- This is life or death, Kelly.
- Okay, okay, okay.

45:04.328 --> 45:06.129
Okay.

45:25.200 --> 45:26.879
Bitch.

45:26.880 --> 45:28.882
Joe.

45:53.200 --> 45:55.239
Dude.

45:55.240 --> 45:56.959
Biaggio.

45:56.960 --> 45:59.042
You're camouflaged horribly.

46:02.120 --> 46:03.679
Dude!!

46:03.680 --> 46:04.959
Where's Joe?

46:04.960 --> 46:06.319
What's up, man?

46:06.320 --> 46:07.479
What's up?

46:07.480 --> 46:08.879
Have you seen Joe?

46:08.880 --> 46:11.159
No, I don't know where he is.

46:11.160 --> 46:12.559
But where's Biaggio?

46:12.560 --> 46:14.399
You're right here.

46:14.400 --> 46:17.324
You're right.. Oh, God.

47:25.360 --> 47:26.679
Okay, fine, fine.

47:26.680 --> 47:28.006
We bought a few chickens.

47:28.007 --> 47:29.645
Less than 30, more than 25.

47:29.646 --> 47:31.046
But the fact is Biaggio and I

47:31.047 --> 47:32.845
have been hunting and getting

47:32.846 --> 47:34.604
pretty goddamn dangerous
out there.

47:34.605 --> 47:36.239
This is hypocrisy.

47:36.240 --> 47:38.766
Joe, listen to yourself.
How can you sleep at night?

47:40.120 --> 47:41.559
Look, I can deal with the fact

47:41.560 --> 47:42.721
that the chickens
were store-bought.

47:42.722 --> 47:43.999
Okay? I can.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.639
But it really bothers me

47:45.640 --> 47:47.801
that the loaded potato
isn't Biaggio's recipe.

47:47.802 --> 47:49.844
No. No, no, that
actually really is.

47:49.845 --> 47:53.526
I.. I honestly have no idea
where he's getting chives.

47:55.480 --> 47:59.280
So, um, can I pass or..?

48:01.440 --> 48:03.239
Judy keeps saying

48:03.240 --> 48:05.607
that wherever they are,
at least they have each other.

48:07.320 --> 48:09.891
I guess that calms me down
sometimes, you know?

48:11.680 --> 48:13.887
I got to
wonder whose idea it all was.

48:13.888 --> 48:15.166
Yeah.

48:16.520 --> 48:18.559
Wait, are you serious?

48:18.560 --> 48:19.891
It could have been
Patrick's idea.

48:19.892 --> 48:21.243
No way. Oh, my gosh.

48:21.244 --> 48:22.922
Joe is the one who drove them

48:22.923 --> 48:24.405
to the movies
when they were nine.

48:24.406 --> 48:25.925
Remember?
Only reason they got caught

48:25.926 --> 48:27.968
is 'cause they went
through a drive-through.

48:27.969 --> 48:30.799
Sunfish. Damn it.

48:30.800 --> 48:34.521
Joe is the one who tied
Patrick's pet turtle to a kite.

48:34.522 --> 48:36.409
Wanted to send him up
into space.

48:37.760 --> 48:38.963
I forgot about that.

48:38.964 --> 48:40.041
Are you laughing?

48:40.042 --> 48:41.759
Are you laughing at that?

48:41.760 --> 48:43.842
It was.. it was more
of a laugh of admiration.

48:43.843 --> 48:45.919
For the murder of a turtle?

48:45.920 --> 48:48.239
The turtle died, then?

48:48.240 --> 48:50.284
Yeah, the turtle died, Frank.

48:50.285 --> 48:52.599
I suppose that's a shame.

48:52.600 --> 48:55.479
The problem is
Joe's a mama's boy.

48:55.480 --> 48:56.925
Clarissa was good for him.

48:56.926 --> 48:58.445
She just let him be.

48:59.800 --> 49:01.802
Something about his innate
sense of menace

49:01.803 --> 49:03.404
seemed to charm her.

49:05.440 --> 49:07.719
Now it's just the two of us.

49:07.720 --> 49:10.479
I-I'm afraid I broke him.

49:10.480 --> 49:13.119
I mean, our sons did run away.

49:13.120 --> 49:16.879
They don't.. they don't want
to be with us.

49:16.880 --> 49:19.759
They don't want
to live in our houses.

49:19.760 --> 49:24.319
I guess maybe.. we did do
something wrong, you know?

49:24.320 --> 49:26.687
What the heck?

49:29.520 --> 49:31.039
Ah.

49:31.040 --> 49:33.964
Patrick is the one
who set up Bicycle Olympics

49:33.965 --> 49:36.039
in my goddamn swimming pool.

49:36.040 --> 49:39.999
That was a nice
$1,300 repair job.

49:40.000 --> 49:43.119
I never called you about that.

49:43.120 --> 49:46.759
Thought we were having
a moment just then, Frank.

49:46.760 --> 49:49.366
And Bicycle Olympics
was Joe's idea.

49:50.760 --> 49:52.967
Goddamn it.

50:06.760 --> 50:09.079
Joe, I love it here.

50:09.080 --> 50:12.639
I want to spend the rest
of my days with you.

50:12.640 --> 50:15.239
That's an emotional fact for me.

50:15.240 --> 50:17.766
Yes, but..

50:20.000 --> 50:22.479
But I worry.

50:22.480 --> 50:25.319
I can't keep my brain
from worrying.

50:25.320 --> 50:27.799
My..

50:27.800 --> 50:29.759
My woman brain.

50:29.760 --> 50:32.759
Ah, my sweet Kelly,

50:32.760 --> 50:35.604
why should we let it
ruin this moment?

50:39.120 --> 50:41.839
Joe!!

50:41.840 --> 50:43.444
It's time to come home.

50:50.400 --> 50:52.799
Leave us, Frank.

50:52.800 --> 50:54.759
The forest is ours.

50:54.760 --> 50:56.719
You're out of your depth.

50:56.720 --> 50:59.291
You made a fool of me
in front of the whole town, boy.

50:59.292 --> 51:01.479
A harlequin.

51:01.480 --> 51:04.563
He is a man grown, and his path
is his own to choose.

51:04.564 --> 51:06.085
Silence, land-trunt.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.759
You win.

51:21.760 --> 51:23.359
- Perfect.

51:23.360 --> 51:25.599
Joe. Hey, bro,
we got company.

51:25.600 --> 51:27.959
Lots of company.

51:27.960 --> 51:29.769
Hi, brother.

51:30.800 --> 51:32.325
All right.

51:38.040 --> 51:40.486
This is so great, Joe.

51:44.360 --> 51:45.599
Yo, bros, what did you guys do

51:45.600 --> 51:46.919
with this chicken?

51:46.920 --> 51:48.522
Melts in your
goddamn mouth, right?

51:48.523 --> 51:51.682
So, um, do you guys eat
the same thing every night?

51:51.683 --> 51:53.165
Yeah, a lot of chicken.

51:53.166 --> 51:54.161
They're everywhere here.

51:54.162 --> 51:55.491
- Right, Joe?
- Oh.

51:55.492 --> 51:56.919
All sorts of them.

51:56.920 --> 51:58.359
Yeah, Patrick, um,

51:58.360 --> 51:59.885
he usually takes care
of the gathering,

51:59.886 --> 52:01.243
you know, berries, roots.

52:01.244 --> 52:03.242
I take care of the meat
and the protein.

52:03.243 --> 52:04.839
And the shopping.

52:04.840 --> 52:07.399
He's a great bargain hunter.

52:07.400 --> 52:09.719
I do the hunting.

52:09.720 --> 52:13.691
So, Biaggio, what do you do?

52:14.760 --> 52:16.283
I met a dog the other day

52:16.284 --> 52:17.611
that taught me how to die.

52:19.520 --> 52:21.724
Yeah, uh, Biaggio here,
he's a..

52:21.725 --> 52:23.003
He's a real renaissance man.

52:23.004 --> 52:24.602
I have incredible focus.

52:24.603 --> 52:26.724
You should see his hands.
So quick.

52:26.725 --> 52:28.839
This cat right here,
he can snatch trout

52:28.840 --> 52:30.046
right out
of the goddamn stream.

52:30.047 --> 52:31.039
Just..

52:31.040 --> 52:32.239
Bullshit.

52:32.240 --> 52:33.924
No, it's true. I've seen it.

52:37.840 --> 52:39.922
I rest my case.

52:42.200 --> 52:44.479
Did you take anything out?

52:44.480 --> 52:46.641
No, he doesn't want your money.

52:46.642 --> 52:47.971
He just does it for sport.

52:47.972 --> 52:49.199
You know, um,

52:49.200 --> 52:52.279
I picked those flowers myself.

52:52.280 --> 52:54.328
Oh, yeah.
They're really pretty.

53:03.120 --> 53:06.359
So what is
this all supposed to be?

53:06.360 --> 53:08.119
This is the den.

53:08.120 --> 53:09.559
Oh, this is the den.

53:09.560 --> 53:10.766
How stupid of me.

53:14.800 --> 53:16.679
Um, and that..

53:16.680 --> 53:19.119
That is the master bedroom.

53:19.120 --> 53:22.679
Wow.

53:22.680 --> 53:24.719
This is really amazing, Joe.

53:24.720 --> 53:26.839
I mean, I had no idea

53:26.840 --> 53:28.999
how talented you were.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.602
I mean, of course,
I suspected, but..

53:30.603 --> 53:32.364
- Of course. Right.
- Of course.

53:54.720 --> 53:56.165
That's horrible.

53:57.840 --> 53:59.763
Yeah. Uh..

54:02.720 --> 54:05.724
Vicki's making eyes
at you, man.

54:07.120 --> 54:08.884
Go talk to her.
Look at her.

54:08.885 --> 54:10.439
She's so into it.

54:10.440 --> 54:11.719
There's no point

54:11.720 --> 54:13.879
in me talking to her anyways.

54:13.880 --> 54:16.119
Why not?

54:16.120 --> 54:18.122
Joe..

54:19.800 --> 54:21.802
I'm gay.

54:23.280 --> 54:24.930
Are you sure? Um..

54:26.080 --> 54:27.879
Yes.

54:27.880 --> 54:30.884
My lungs fill up with fluid
every time the seasons change.

54:33.680 --> 54:36.839
That's not being gay, Biaggio.

54:36.840 --> 54:38.639
What?

54:38.640 --> 54:40.688
I'm pretty sure
that's cystic fibrosis.

54:40.689 --> 54:42.159
Oh.

54:42.160 --> 54:43.999
Biaggio, I don't know why

54:44.000 --> 54:46.839
you're smiling... cystic fibrosis
is not a walk in the park.

54:46.840 --> 54:48.410
It's actually
a very serious medical..

54:48.411 --> 54:51.519
Hey, what-what about Kelly?

54:51.520 --> 54:54.719
She's just doing what..
All girls do.

54:54.720 --> 54:56.039
You know?

54:56.040 --> 54:58.201
Pretending like
she doesn't care.

54:58.202 --> 55:00.487
Playing hard to get.
I don't know.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.923
Oh, man.

55:49.600 --> 55:51.439
Hey.

55:51.440 --> 55:52.839
Patrick?

55:52.840 --> 55:54.919
- Yeah?
- Can you sleep?

55:54.920 --> 55:56.559
Um.. yeah.

55:56.560 --> 55:59.643
Well, do you want to go
for a walk or something?

55:59.644 --> 56:02.159
'Cause I can't sleep.

56:02.160 --> 56:04.367
- Sure.
- Okay.

56:50.360 --> 56:52.806
Hey. Joe?

56:54.280 --> 56:56.760
Joe, we're leaving.

56:58.760 --> 57:00.762
Are you awake?

57:46.800 --> 57:49.690
Biaggio!!

57:51.520 --> 57:53.319
Jesus Christ, dude.

57:53.320 --> 57:56.449
Stay above the surface
where I could see you, okay?

57:58.760 --> 58:01.359
Um..
Look, I'm gonna go for a walk.

58:01.360 --> 58:03.119
Don't wait up.

58:03.120 --> 58:06.727
You should try not
to think about them so much.

58:14.800 --> 58:17.079
Yeah, uh..

58:17.080 --> 58:20.448
I'm sorry I'm not more fun
to be around right now.

58:32.240 --> 58:34.359
Call me with anything.

58:34.360 --> 58:36.599
Okay? Anything.
I'm not far.

58:36.600 --> 58:38.762
Yeah. Thanks.

58:40.040 --> 58:42.559
Take care, Colin.

58:42.560 --> 58:44.559
Have fun with.. singing.

58:44.560 --> 58:47.159
Oh. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

58:47.160 --> 58:48.730
Um, I'm actually part of a..

58:48.731 --> 58:52.279
A cappella band called Mmm.

58:52.280 --> 58:53.639
So long.

58:53.640 --> 58:55.285
Uh, we're actually,
uh, performing

58:55.286 --> 58:58.564
12-part harmony to, uh,
"And the Band Played On."

58:58.565 --> 59:00.402
- Good night.
- Do you know the song?

59:00.403 --> 59:02.879
Uh, I'll just do the chorus,
then, just real fast.

59:02.880 --> 59:04.166
Oh, babe, I don't think it's..

59:04.167 --> 59:05.959
Casey would waltz

59:05.960 --> 59:08.319
With the strawberry blonde

59:08.320 --> 59:10.399
And the band

59:10.400 --> 59:13.199
- Played on Thank you.

59:13.200 --> 59:15.646
He'd glide cross the floor
with the girl

59:15.647 --> 59:17.919
He adored, and the

59:17.920 --> 59:20.479
Band played on

59:20.480 --> 59:22.199
Great.

59:22.200 --> 59:24.959
His brain was so loaded

59:24.960 --> 59:26.519
It nearly

59:26.520 --> 59:28.249
- Exploded
- Still going.

59:28.250 --> 59:32.519
The poor girl
would shake with alarm

59:32.520 --> 59:35.039
He'd never leave
the girl with the

59:35.040 --> 59:37.119
Strawberry curls

59:37.120 --> 59:38.879
And the

59:38.880 --> 59:40.159
Band

59:40.160 --> 59:41.719
Played..

59:41.720 --> 59:44.839
- On..
- Okay. Oh, babe.

59:44.840 --> 59:47.079
- Babe.
- Ooh!!

59:47.080 --> 59:49.367
I think I may never get
an erection again.

59:49.368 --> 59:50.919
Dad!! Jesus!!

59:50.920 --> 59:53.879
Well.. I mean..

59:53.880 --> 59:56.959
Uh, it was good
seeing you again.

59:56.960 --> 59:59.159
All right, drive safe.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.561
Aw, come on.

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.759
Come on, honey, he just..

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.762
Serenaded me... I can't pretend

01:00:06.763 --> 01:00:08.799
- that's acceptable.
- Right.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.164
Thanks for giving it
the old college try.

01:00:11.165 --> 01:00:12.810
I appreciate it.
I got to go.

01:00:12.811 --> 01:00:14.290
Shit, I'm sorry.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.446
Heather.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:23.004
I'm not a bastard, am I?

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.764
No, Dad, a bastard would make
everyone around him miserable

01:00:27.765 --> 01:00:29.842
just 'cause he is.

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.919
Hey.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.759
Hey, uh, we..

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.599
You do your thing. Just..

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.319
I'll see you kids..

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:01.369
Back at the house.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.599
Look.. don't worry.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.282
He could never be mad at you.

01:01:15.283 --> 01:01:16.805
You guys are like brothers.

01:01:16.806 --> 01:01:19.839
This is different.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:22.439
This is way different.

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.239
Did this work?

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.839
Running away?

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.406
I mean, are you
really happy out here?

01:01:28.407 --> 01:01:30.205
Yeah. You know, I'm just..

01:01:30.206 --> 01:01:32.680
I'm happy to be
wherever my parents are not.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.519
Ah..

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:58.729
Is anything better
than a good stogie, Biaggio?

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.131
Being in a situation

01:02:01.132 --> 01:02:02.879
where it's easier to lie

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.848
but you choose
to tell the truth.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.519
Hmm.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:09.559
Guess that is better.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.759
Okay, I will trade
you B&O Railroad

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.125
for both your utilities.

01:02:14.126 --> 01:02:15.959
- Eh.
- Eh.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.281
Eh.. and this "Get Out
of Jail Free" card.

01:02:18.282 --> 01:02:19.879
Deal.

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.599
Deal. That's a good deal.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.479
That's a good trade.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.839
What?

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.199
Yeah.

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.085
All four railroads
for the utilities

01:02:28.086 --> 01:02:30.481
and your
"Get Out of Jail Free" card.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.410
Savvy.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.239
Oh, look at that...

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.765
"Free Parking."

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.559
You know what?

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.131
I think I'm gonna buy
some more houses.

01:02:46.132 --> 01:02:48.839
How many is "more"?

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.439
Give me a second.

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.679
Actually..

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:55.759
Biaggio, I will
give you Baltic,

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.839
Park Place and both my greens

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.159
- for both your oranges.
- I want $1,000.

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:03.606
- I'll give you $50.
- Okay.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.761
Pleasure doing
business with you.

01:03:08.762 --> 01:03:10.485
You just went
from $1,000 to $50?

01:03:10.486 --> 01:03:11.923
The men.. are talking.

01:03:11.924 --> 01:03:14.127
Yes, Patrick,
the men are talking.

01:03:14.128 --> 01:03:16.039
Realtor, could I please get

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:19.159
- three hotels?
- Oh, yeah, sure. On what?

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.527
Orange. What I just bought.

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:27.601
There you go, property manager.

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:41.439
What's up, Joe?

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.759
Nothing's up.

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:46.206
It's your roll.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:52.119
Look, Joe, if I roll a six,
an eight or a nine,

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:54.919
things are gonna get
very bad in here.

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.519
I don't know what
to tell you, buddy.

01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:00.330
Just think of all the
other numbers in the world.

01:04:00.331 --> 01:04:03.439
Is everything okay
with you guys?

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.999
Yeah.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.287
We're golden.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.719
What was that play, Joe?!!

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:22.765
- Jesus!! It is a game!!
- That was the lowest,

01:04:22.766 --> 01:04:24.967
shittiest, dickhead move
I've ever seen.

01:04:24.968 --> 01:04:27.439
Second lowest.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.039
Wow.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.771
No one was ever trying
to hurt you, Joe.

01:04:31.772 --> 01:04:34.079
It was never about you!!

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.762
We just.. It just happened!!

01:04:35.763 --> 01:04:37.442
- Get over it!!
- I'm over it!!

01:04:37.443 --> 01:04:38.723
The bitch wants you, then she's

01:04:38.724 --> 01:04:40.046
not good enough for me anyway!!

01:04:40.047 --> 01:04:41.963
Who the fuck are you,
Mary J. Blige?

01:04:41.964 --> 01:04:44.079
- Jesus Christ!!
- Joe, I..

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.725
Shut up, Kelly!!
All right?

01:04:45.726 --> 01:04:48.483
Everything was fine
until you came into the picture.

01:04:48.484 --> 01:04:51.245
You're like..
Jesus, you're like a cancer!!

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.879
Uh..

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.723
I'm gonna go.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.639
What was that, Joe?

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:13.799
You know what?
Go be with her.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:16.644
Go hang with Kelly
and your goddamn mother.

01:05:16.645 --> 01:05:19.919
I don't..
Joe, I don't want to go.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.839
Joe, I want to stay here.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:24.566
- You want to stay here? -This
is the most fun I've ever had.

01:05:24.567 --> 01:05:26.319
We built this house together!!

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.482
- Go be with her, man, hmm?
- Joe, I don't want to go.

01:05:28.483 --> 01:05:30.960
- Get out of here, man!!
- Come on, man, I didn't..

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.165
Come on!!

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.079
I'll get the tools.

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.879
We'll fix it.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:25.611
Leave me alone, Biaggio.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.319
What do you mean?

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.639
I'm saying I want to be alone.

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:36.279
Go away.

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:39.039
Don't mince words with me, Joe.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.479
We've been through too much.

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:44.609
Just leave.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.523
Kelly!!

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:21.039
Kelly.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.765
I didn't mean for any
of this to happen.

01:07:22.766 --> 01:07:24.569
I didn't want
to come between friends.

01:07:24.570 --> 01:07:26.244
I've just.. I've..

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.125
No!!

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.244
Damn it!!

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.565
God..!!

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.081
Fuck!!

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.048
We didn't want to wake you.

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.041
Yeah.

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.486
Welcome home, Patrick.

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:51.439
Stop.

01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:53.559
Yep.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:56.006
- Glad you're back.

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:03.005
The report says this boy
was with him the whole week.

01:10:03.006 --> 01:10:04.842
He's given us nothing so far.

01:10:04.843 --> 01:10:06.569
He has a contempt for the law

01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:09.199
I've never seen in a minor.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.439
Look at him.
He won't sit down.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.519
He won't deflate the room.

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.921
It's actually
quite sophisticated.

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:35.009
This kid is in my head.

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:45.930
If you need to leave, Sergeant,
there's no shame in it.

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:49.639
Yeah, maybe just to..

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:52.007
Splash a bit of cold water
on my face.

01:10:52.008 --> 01:10:53.839
There is shame in it,

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.640
but please leave anyway.

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:02.759
Oh, God.

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:04.359
And Patrick?

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.639
He says he hasn't seen Joe

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:09.120
since they split up.

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:33.599
No.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.728
It stays on.

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:44.679
Oh, my God.

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.444
Dude!!

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:51.719
Hey!!

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.879
Dude, this is my spot, man!!
You're ruining my spot!!

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:55.803
I thought you said you'd
never been here before.

01:11:55.804 --> 01:11:57.079
I haven't.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.279
Freak.

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.399
- I'm sorry.
- Come on.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.006
I got another spot.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:18.487
No fear!!

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.922
Sorry.

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:36.211
We were just.. hungry.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.442
I guess we were all just hungry.

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:45.726
Sorry I yelled.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:53.971
Goddamn it.

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.279
"Save the heart and liver
if you wish

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:22.966
and cut from rectum
to collar bone."

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.279
Well, anyway, if you guys

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:21.328
are going to go hunting,
you're going to need these.

01:15:21.329 --> 01:15:24.562
Uh, they're masks that you wear
on the back of your head

01:15:24.563 --> 01:15:26.445
to keep the animals
away from you.

01:15:26.446 --> 01:15:28.841
To keep them from stalking you,
essentially.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.647
This is yours...
on the back of your head.

01:15:32.648 --> 01:15:34.722
This one supposed to be me?

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:38.728
Yeah.

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:54.001
Hello?

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:08.250
Whoa.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.368
Whoa.

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.445
On now to the story
which has captivated

01:16:39.446 --> 01:16:40.679
much of Tottenville County.

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:42.639
Where is Joseph Toy?

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:46.042
It's been more than four weeks
since the 15-year-old left home.

01:16:46.043 --> 01:16:47.879
Toy's friend Patrick Keenan

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:50.406
returned home safely
this past Tuesday

01:16:50.407 --> 01:16:53.799
with his family calling it,
quote, "a miracle."

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:57.159
Keenan claims
he hasn't seen Toy in weeks.

01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:00.322
Toy is described as
approximately five-foot-seven,

01:17:00.323 --> 01:17:02.721
with straight brown hair
and blue eyes.

01:17:02.722 --> 01:17:06.121
Anyone with information
regarding Joseph Toy should call

01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:08.361
the Tottenville County
Sheriff's Department.

01:17:08.362 --> 01:17:12.365
Coming up: Could caffeine
lead to longer, stronger..

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.679
Sure.

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.364
Every man has.

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:26.362
Well, there's good quitting
and bad quitting, Biaggio.

01:17:26.363 --> 01:17:28.919
Quit drinking soda:
good quitting.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:32.279
I quit law school:
bad quitting.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.884
Do you see?

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.288
You should never quit
on a friend, son.

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.199
Of course you would.

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.407
Yeah, okay.
That's what I thought.

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:06.679
I-I don't eat cookies.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:08.170
I'm sorry to bother you.

01:18:08.171 --> 01:18:10.162
I, uh..

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:17.122
I can take you to Joe.

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:32.319
Joe?

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:34.799
Dad?
Joe!!

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.766
- Dad!! Dad, don't come in here!!
- Are you all right?

01:18:36.767 --> 01:18:38.842
- Joe, Joe, I'm not going to
hurt you. -Joe, I'm so sorry.

01:18:38.843 --> 01:18:40.808
Seriously, do not come in.
There's a snake.

01:18:40.809 --> 01:18:42.039
Whoa.

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:43.719
What do I do?

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:46.121
Kelly.. look at me.

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.399
Be cool, all right?

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.279
Be calm.

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:54.039
- Be still.
- Whoa.

01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:56.361
- Do not move.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:18:56.362 --> 01:18:59.039
It can sense fear, all right?

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:01.199
Don't move.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:02.611
- No, no, no!!
- Easy, easy.

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.921
Joe!! Joe, don't be an idiot!!

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:09.685
Be calm.

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:15.239
- That's good.

01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:16.685
What the hell is that?

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:19.804
Biaggio?

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.122
Infamata.

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:42.728
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my living Christ.

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:47.446
Holy shit.

01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.559
Oh..

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:00.799
Joe, no!! No, no, Joe!!

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.519
Fuck you, snake!!

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:04.479
He's awake.

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:06.402
- You're okay.
- Did it get me, man?

01:20:06.403 --> 01:20:08.764
- Yeah, a little bit. Um..
- Small bite. -Okay.

01:20:08.765 --> 01:20:10.599
Dad, take the head and the body

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.680
and bury them in two separate
holes, do you understand?

01:20:12.681 --> 01:20:13.966
The venom will attract
other snakes.

01:20:13.967 --> 01:20:15.399
Okay.

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:16.919
- Dad, now!!
- Okay.

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.647
Can you not just,
like, suck it out of him?

01:20:18.648 --> 01:20:20.210
The venom has already
entered his bloodstream.

01:20:20.211 --> 01:20:21.929
Okay, we got
to get him out of here.

01:20:21.930 --> 01:20:23.599
- Oh!! Oh!!
- My God.

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.359
Maybe that's good.
Maybe that's good.

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:27.328
Maybe he got it out. Maybe he
got it out of his system.

01:20:27.329 --> 01:20:28.879
Dad, can you bring the car up?

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:30.119
Yeah, I'll just..
I'll carry it, I guess,

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.483
or fly it over the forest.

01:20:31.484 --> 01:20:33.684
No, I can't bring
the car up here!!

01:20:33.685 --> 01:20:35.359
Your jokes
are not funny right now!!

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:37.281
Guys, stop yelling!!
This isn't helping anything!!

01:20:37.282 --> 01:20:39.360
- He's getting worse. -Oh, my
God, he's really letting it go.

01:20:39.361 --> 01:20:41.486
- You're pissing yourself, kid.
- Guys, he is burning up.

01:20:41.487 --> 01:20:42.561
We need to get him out of here.

01:20:42.562 --> 01:20:44.079
You up for a little walk, buddy?

01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:45.570
All right, look,
you two, run up ahead,

01:20:45.571 --> 01:20:47.045
pull the car up
as close as you can

01:20:47.046 --> 01:20:48.525
to the mouth of the woods.

01:20:48.526 --> 01:20:50.439
- You know how to put it
in gear? -Fuck, yeah.

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:52.408
Watch your mouth. Good, good.
Let's go!! Let's go!! Move!!

01:20:52.409 --> 01:20:53.890
Come here.

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:57.921
Did you have asparagus?

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:28.844
Hang on.

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:02.091
Uh.. try these.

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.919
So..

01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:34.039
You honestly believe
that you saw Heaven?

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:35.719
Yes.

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:37.324
There were many demons.

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:40.799
But I'm better now.

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.359
Stronger.

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:46.046
If I had to do it over,
I'd get bitten again.

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:50.279
I know you would, Biaggio.

01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:52.279
You're a good friend.

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:53.959
Remember when I said,

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:57.165
"If I had to do it over,
I'd get bitten again"?

01:23:57.166 --> 01:23:58.924
You.. you just said that.

01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:02.879
I was wrong.

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:05.406
I would never do that again.

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.762
Joe.

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:21.239
I..

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:25.319
I, um, got this for you
from the gift shop.

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:29.120
Uh, it has an eagle on it,
the snake's natural enemy.

01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:35.929
"You're miles above the rest."

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.364
I-I guess they didn't
have one that said, uh,

01:24:40.365 --> 01:24:42.282
"You saved me
from an agonizing death

01:24:42.283 --> 01:24:44.044
by rapid blood oxygenation."

01:24:44.045 --> 01:24:47.123
Uh, they did; just no envelopes.

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:51.959
Look, Joe, just..

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:54.599
Just because we're not dating

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:57.999
doesn't mean that I don't
care about you at all.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.241
We didn't even know
if you were dead or not.

01:25:00.242 --> 01:25:01.730
You know?

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:06.802
I would give you a hug
or something, but I don't know,

01:25:06.803 --> 01:25:09.280
maybe you don't want
to be anywhere near me.

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:12.559
No.

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.642
A hug can work.

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:21.559
Hey.

01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:22.999
Is he okay?

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.719
Uh, yeah.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.802
Biaggio is in there.

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:36.965
Okay.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.919
Okay.

01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:57.439
See you, bro.

01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:58.930
So, who's this Kelly?

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:02.679
Is that Patrick's girlfriend?

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:04.279
Yep.

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:06.039
Looking that way.

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:09.010
She looks like
a real heartbreaker.

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:13.523
Yes.

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:19.679
You were very good, Joe.

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:21.921
In the woods, before.

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.759
Good?

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:26.079
Yeah.

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:27.730
You were very good.

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.329
I was really proud of you.

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:36.679
Thanks.

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.762
Guess I'm a man now, huh?

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:42.959
You're getting there, bud.

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:45.039
No need to rush.

01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:46.599
Stroke alert.

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:48.479
Fifth floor, building B.

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:49.879
Room 514.

01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:52.319
Stroke alert.

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:55.319
So, uh..

01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:58.599
How are things
between you and Carol?

01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:00.439
Carol?

01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:02.362
You're referring
to the spider woman

01:27:02.363 --> 01:27:03.643
I found in the gutter?

01:27:03.644 --> 01:27:05.242
That you found
in the gutter, yes.

01:27:05.243 --> 01:27:07.204
- That's the one.
- The same. One and the same.

01:27:07.205 --> 01:27:08.723
Things, uh..
Things are actually

01:27:08.724 --> 01:27:10.961
cooled down between
Carol and me.

01:27:10.962 --> 01:27:12.199
It's baffling.

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:13.879
Just.. I can't quite

01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:16.565
pinpoint the exact moment
when everything went south.

01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:21.879
- Yeah.
- It's a puzzle.

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:23.530
Sorry about that one.

01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:26.839
It's okay.

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:28.729
It wouldn't have worked anyway.

01:27:28.730 --> 01:27:30.290
She didn't..

01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:33.999
I don't know, she..

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.319
She didn't make me nervous.

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:39.519
Not like your mom did, anyway.

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.887
And you need that.

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:48.289
Mm-hmm.

01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:54.966
I know. I know.

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:54.770
What's going on over there?
