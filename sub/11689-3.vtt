Table for two under
McLintock, Mike McLintock.

00:24.454 --> 00:26.421
Uh, yes. The table is ready.

00:26.506 --> 00:28.373
We're clear. Bring in Sparrow.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.343
Listen, can I just reiterate once again

00:32.462 --> 00:34.712
how really, really sorry I am?

00:34.798 --> 00:38.132
Wow! Oh, look at this. I
guess they like us, huh?

00:38.268 --> 00:41.386
Hi. Wonderful. What were you saying?

00:41.471 --> 00:44.639
How really sorry I am. And I'm not
someone who loves to apologize.

00:44.724 --> 00:47.308
Uh-huh, right, but you're
loving it now, aren't you?

00:47.394 --> 00:48.693
Oh, loving it. Want another one?

00:48.812 --> 00:50.979
- Yeah, I do.
- I'm really sorry.

00:51.064 --> 00:53.815
- I'm really, really, really sorry.
- Now sing it.

00:53.950 --> 00:56.951
The president and Mr. Baird
enjoyed a delicious dinner

00:57.037 --> 01:00.154
of blue crabs trapped by
local fisherman Steve Yerkes

01:00.290 --> 01:02.874
and a cheese course including
"Basil Hayden" Blue

01:02.993 --> 01:04.375
from Jasper Hill, Vermont.

01:04.494 --> 01:06.661
Mike, how is she able
to focus on the economy

01:06.796 --> 01:08.580
if she's running around
with her new boyfriend?

01:08.665 --> 01:12.417
The president has always placed great
value on fiscal responsibility.

01:12.502 --> 01:14.802
In fact, as vice president,
she was chairman

01:14.888 --> 01:17.839
of the Meyer Postal Commission,
which reduced post office debt

01:17.924 --> 01:21.392
from 65 billion to just over 62 billion.

01:21.511 --> 01:24.012
Okay, Eagle. Well, I'll
see you in a few seconds.

01:24.097 --> 01:25.647
Yeah, bye.

01:25.732 --> 01:27.932
All right, we got six
more votes this morning.

01:28.018 --> 01:30.234
- Whoo!
- We're never gonna close that gap.

01:30.353 --> 01:34.739
Well, on the less shitty side, people are
really loving you and Charlie Baird.

01:34.858 --> 01:36.608
Even Wall Street's got
a boner for you guys.

01:36.693 --> 01:38.359
- Really? The market's up?
- No, it's flat.

01:38.495 --> 01:40.411
But not down is straight
up for us at this point.

01:40.530 --> 01:43.915
Madam President, we have received
word that Chinese hackers

01:44.034 --> 01:46.534
have now breached the National
Security Council servers.

01:46.620 --> 01:48.953
I got a great idea. Why
don't we give the Chinese

01:49.039 --> 01:50.588
their own log-ins and passwords?

01:50.707 --> 01:52.790
Okay? Save everybody a lot of time.

01:52.876 --> 01:57.045
Ma'am, the FDA is monitoring a salmonella
outbreak at a Missouri chicken farm.

01:57.180 --> 01:59.464
- Got a few fowl questions.
- What?

01:59.549 --> 02:01.215
Also from the comms department,

02:01.301 --> 02:03.184
multiple mentions of tomorrow's trip

02:03.269 --> 02:04.886
to the Museum of Natural History

02:04.971 --> 02:07.021
in New York City with Mr. Charlie Baird.

02:07.107 --> 02:09.857
Huh, not bad. Phone.

02:09.943 --> 02:12.143
Oh, listen to this.

02:12.228 --> 02:15.613
Charlie says O'Brien won't go down on
his wife without biscuits and gravy.

02:17.233 --> 02:19.867
Hey, can you show me
how to find on Twitter

02:19.953 --> 02:22.570
those tweets where people were
gushing about me and Charlie?

02:22.656 --> 02:24.288
Oh, yeah. You see this
button right here?

02:24.407 --> 02:27.575
Okay, so listen,
certification is tomorrow.

02:27.661 --> 02:29.460
I mean, seriously, do we have any reason

02:29.579 --> 02:32.163
to think that we're not as
fucked as a Senate page here?

02:32.248 --> 02:35.383
Actually, ma'am... I'm sorry I'm late...
I think I may have found something.

02:35.468 --> 02:39.754
The voting data in Nevada is multiple
standard deviations outside the means.

02:39.839 --> 02:41.589
Christ, Kent, know your audience.

02:41.725 --> 02:43.891
I think that there is
statistical evidence

02:43.977 --> 02:45.760
of missing ballots in Nevada.

02:45.845 --> 02:47.345
- Where?
- I do not know.

02:47.430 --> 02:48.930
- How many?
- I do not know.

02:49.015 --> 02:50.932
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

02:51.017 --> 02:52.517
Graydon Carter is begging
for a photo spread

02:52.602 --> 02:54.769
of you and Charlie Baird
in "Vanity Fair."

02:54.854 --> 02:58.106
Hey, Garfield, we're right in the
middle of talking about Nevada, okay?

02:58.241 --> 02:59.657
Kent, what can you tell us?

02:59.776 --> 03:02.193
I might be able to
pinpoint the vote anomaly

03:02.278 --> 03:05.913
if I could break down confounding
variables using an intercept model.

03:05.999 --> 03:09.117
What Alan Turing is trying to say
is if there are missing votes,

03:09.202 --> 03:10.752
- he needs time to find them.
- Mm-hmm.

03:10.837 --> 03:12.837
<i>All right, then we have to delay</i>

03:12.956 --> 03:14.622
<i>the certification of the recount.</i>

03:14.758 --> 03:16.424
Exactly my thought, ma'am.

03:16.509 --> 03:18.593
I could have the lawyers
file an injunction.

03:18.628 --> 03:21.295
- Bob, what do you think?
- <i> I think it's a weak case.</i>

03:21.431 --> 03:23.848
Let me just take a meeting
with Jim Whitman.

03:23.967 --> 03:26.300
And after I'm done dick slapping him,

03:26.436 --> 03:28.469
he will have agreed to
delay certification.

03:28.555 --> 03:31.723
- Amy, set it up.
- The injunction or the dick slapping?

03:31.808 --> 03:33.775
Christ, Amy, the meeting.

03:33.860 --> 03:36.444
All right, gonna have to start
chumming the media waters.

03:36.529 --> 03:38.196
I want you to get me on the horn

03:38.314 --> 03:40.815
with Ned Mitchell from
the "Las Vegas Gazette"

03:40.900 --> 03:42.817
and Susan Bailey with the "Reno Star."

03:42.902 --> 03:45.787
Amy, set it up. Sue Bailey,
the "Reno Star," everything.

03:45.872 --> 03:47.538
Madam President, who would you say

03:47.657 --> 03:50.658
would be your best person to be
at that meeting as my number two?

03:50.794 --> 03:52.043
- I could.
- Richard.

03:52.162 --> 03:53.711
Oh, well.

03:53.830 --> 03:56.631
Okay, listen, I need to
talk to Bob privately,

03:56.716 --> 03:58.132
so everybody get out, please.

03:58.218 --> 04:00.218
- Even...
- <i> Yeah-huh.</i>

04:02.005 --> 04:05.339
Bob, I am going crazy here in DC.

04:05.425 --> 04:07.341
I just... I feel trapped

04:07.427 --> 04:09.010
like a Saudi housekeeper.

04:09.095 --> 04:12.430
Is there any way I could get to Nevada?

04:12.515 --> 04:14.599
Just let me win the presidency for you

04:14.684 --> 04:17.517
and then you can land Air
Force One on the Strip

04:17.654 --> 04:19.403
and piss in Caesar's
fountain if you want.

04:19.522 --> 04:21.522
Oh, come on, please, Bob, I
would never stay at Caesar's.

04:21.658 --> 04:23.524
Yes? What?

04:23.576 --> 04:25.693
Ma'am, weekly CIA briefing.

04:25.779 --> 04:27.528
See? Crapistan's calling.

04:27.614 --> 04:29.697
That's what I'm talking about.
I'll talk to you later, though.

04:29.833 --> 04:32.033
<i>Catherine, do not use any
of the vulgar parts.</i>

04:32.118 --> 04:33.701
Yeah, but that's like all of it, Mom.

04:33.787 --> 04:35.870
- Well, then don't use it.
- But it's a doc.

04:36.005 --> 04:38.673
- A what?
- A documentary.

04:38.758 --> 04:40.842
Then say that.

04:47.550 --> 04:49.717
Never heard back from you.

04:49.853 --> 04:51.719
Late night?

04:51.855 --> 04:53.688
Sophie told you?

04:53.773 --> 04:55.723
What?

04:55.809 --> 04:57.225
No.

04:57.310 --> 04:59.143
Gross.

04:59.229 --> 05:01.863
You didn't tell me she worked for CBS.

05:03.399 --> 05:04.982
Oh!

05:05.068 --> 05:07.318
Oh, this is too good.

05:07.403 --> 05:10.204
Dan, Sophie doesn't work for CBS.

05:10.290 --> 05:12.740
She works for CVS.

05:12.826 --> 05:14.792
<i>You sold your dick for bulk iced tea</i>

05:14.911 --> 05:16.494
<i>and off-brand cough syrup.</i>

05:16.579 --> 05:17.829
Don't worry.

05:17.914 --> 05:20.047
You're gonna look really
cute in a blue vest.

05:21.668 --> 05:23.501
I am not having a good year.

05:25.255 --> 05:27.672
Unfortunately, ma'am,
the man we captured

05:27.757 --> 05:30.091
is not, in fact, Abdullah Saeed.

05:30.176 --> 05:31.926
Do the Israelis know
anything about this?

05:32.061 --> 05:33.928
Because they're a sneaky bunch of fucks.

05:34.013 --> 05:35.730
Excuse me one second, ma'am.

05:39.769 --> 05:43.938
So Mike McLintock, tonight for 8:30.
Thank you.

05:44.073 --> 05:46.941
Sorry, Kent, Salt and
Moon, new restaurant.

05:47.076 --> 05:49.327
Impressive. How did you
secure a reservation there?

05:49.445 --> 05:51.996
Well, Sue uses my name
for POTUS reservations,

05:52.115 --> 05:54.365
so when I call, I get an amazing table.

05:54.450 --> 05:55.833
I'm back on food.

05:55.952 --> 05:58.419
Doctor says the cleanse
caused no lasting damage.

05:58.504 --> 06:02.123
@POTUS is tweeting?

06:02.258 --> 06:04.375
I'm the only one who's
supposed to send her tweets.

06:04.460 --> 06:07.962
"Ha, ha, ha, @RealCharlieBaird.
Here's one for you now."

06:08.097 --> 06:09.931
The president is tweeting.

06:10.016 --> 06:11.682
She's tweeting?

06:15.021 --> 06:17.188
Sorry, just... I just have to go in.

06:17.307 --> 06:17.991
The president has to...

06:18.016 --> 06:19.414
I can't let you in
there, sir, I'm sorry.

06:19.475 --> 06:21.475
Please, Marjorie, please. I
have to talk to the president.

06:21.611 --> 06:23.361
- Please take a step back.
- Look, please.

06:23.479 --> 06:24.979
Oh, no.

06:26.065 --> 06:27.315
- Uh, ma'am.
- Yes?

06:27.450 --> 06:29.317
It turns out our prisoner's name

06:29.402 --> 06:31.986
is Abdullah Faeed, a
local schoolteacher.

06:32.121 --> 06:34.155
What is he doing?

06:34.290 --> 06:36.157
- What is that?
- Beats me.

06:36.292 --> 06:38.326
Hi, ma'am. If you hear
this, do not tweet.

06:38.411 --> 06:41.329
- Please, stop... ma'am?
- Mike, what are you doing?

06:41.414 --> 06:42.997
- You tweeted.
- What?

06:43.082 --> 06:44.465
About O'Brien. It wasn't nice.

06:44.550 --> 06:46.167
I just direct messaged Charlie.

06:46.302 --> 06:49.170
No, it was public. Everybody
saw it on Twitter.

06:49.305 --> 06:50.805
- No, they didn't.
- What did you tweet?

06:50.890 --> 06:53.174
What? It was just some
funny joke I was just...

06:53.259 --> 06:55.760
- Oh, shi...
- I pushed that feather button.

06:55.845 --> 06:58.312
I know, you tweet... that's a tweet.

06:58.398 --> 07:00.264
- That's a tweet.
- Well, then delete it!

07:00.350 --> 07:02.066
- Delete it!
- Just delete it!

07:02.185 --> 07:04.018
- Delete it!
- Hey, hey, hey!

07:04.153 --> 07:06.270
- What? Okay.
- Not here.

07:08.441 --> 07:11.359
Gary, I did it the way
you showed me to do it.

07:11.444 --> 07:13.661
But that's not the way
I showed you to do...

07:13.746 --> 07:16.697
That's exactly the way that
you showed me to do it.

07:16.783 --> 07:18.082
Do you want me to show you again?

07:18.201 --> 07:19.867
I'll tell you what I want you to do.

07:19.953 --> 07:21.252
Nothing, okay?

07:21.371 --> 07:23.120
That's your punishment. Get out.

07:23.206 --> 07:24.789
Okay, I'll just go make some tea.

07:24.874 --> 07:26.374
You better not.

07:26.509 --> 07:30.795
The Swedish prime minister just
retweeted your tweets with an LOL.

07:30.880 --> 07:34.298
Well, what the FOL are we
supposed to do about this?

07:34.384 --> 07:36.100
I suggest that we disavow the tweets.

07:36.219 --> 07:37.935
Phones are hacked all the time

07:38.054 --> 07:40.438
to steal pictures of celebrities'
penises and whatnot.

07:40.556 --> 07:42.690
- Oh, my God.
- Hold that thought, Kent.

07:42.775 --> 07:44.892
Madam President, are
you sure you did this?

07:45.028 --> 07:46.727
What do you mean, am I sure?

07:46.863 --> 07:49.814
Well, maybe the White House computers
aren't as secure as we think.

07:49.899 --> 07:52.733
Maybe the firewalls
have more holes in them

07:52.819 --> 07:54.151
than a gold digger's diaphragm.

07:54.237 --> 07:56.070
My God, I hated those things.

07:56.205 --> 07:57.788
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

07:57.907 --> 08:01.375
- There was a breach earlier today.
- Mm-hmm.

08:01.461 --> 08:04.912
Oh, my God, and maybe that
breach concerned those tweets.

08:05.048 --> 08:06.028
Maybe it did.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.990
Oh, my God, maybe you had
nothing to do with it.

08:09.085 --> 08:11.302
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

08:11.421 --> 08:13.504
In that case, China would be blamed

08:13.589 --> 08:17.141
for your messages going public, maybe.

08:17.260 --> 08:19.260
So is that what I think happened?

08:19.345 --> 08:20.928
That China tweeted this?

08:21.064 --> 08:24.515
Oh, no, ma'am, no. You have
no idea what happened.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.818
And neither does Mike, who
would be outraged by this.

08:27.937 --> 08:29.403
Actually, ma'am, I have a better idea.

08:29.489 --> 08:31.188
No, you don't, Mike.
History has proven that.

08:31.274 --> 08:33.774
Now, let me just run this by Bob

08:33.909 --> 08:36.027
and see if he thinks blaming
China is a good idea.

08:36.111 --> 08:38.946
- This can't leave this room.
- Can or can't?

08:39.032 --> 08:40.448
- It cannot, Mike.
- Not!

08:40.582 --> 08:41.749
Why don't you just tell the truth?

08:43.453 --> 08:45.920
- I don't sound like that.
- That's exactly how you sound.

08:46.005 --> 08:47.538
- No, I don't.
- Spot-on.

08:47.623 --> 08:49.040
Yeah, it's pretty close.

08:49.125 --> 08:50.674
I don't know where you
get that impersonation.

08:50.793 --> 08:53.377
Ma'am, you have to make a decision now.

08:53.463 --> 08:56.263
I mean, can I really
blame another country

08:56.349 --> 08:57.965
for something they didn't do?

08:58.051 --> 08:59.850
It's been the cornerstone
of American foreign policy

08:59.969 --> 09:01.802
since the Spanish American War.

09:01.888 --> 09:05.639
This morning the White House
cybersecurity was breached

09:05.775 --> 09:08.442
by what the NSA has come
to believe was a hack

09:08.528 --> 09:10.611
that originated in mainland China.

09:10.696 --> 09:14.315
Mike, Mike, what about the president's
tweet about Senator O'Brien?

09:14.400 --> 09:15.816
The president was horrified.

09:15.902 --> 09:20.287
Horrified by this latest
violation of cybersecurity.

09:20.373 --> 09:23.908
The president believes
cybersecurity is paramount

09:23.993 --> 09:26.794
for the United States' future survival.

09:28.498 --> 09:30.331
Kent, any progress on the ballots?

09:30.416 --> 09:33.501
I've eliminated eight counties
as potential locales,

09:33.636 --> 09:35.086
but there's no way around my doing

09:35.171 --> 09:37.471
a district-by-district
regression analysis.

09:37.557 --> 09:40.174
Are we paying you by the word
here, Kent, or what? Ben?

09:40.259 --> 09:43.177
He needs more time. Ma'am, we
got O'Brien on a live feed.

09:43.262 --> 09:45.479
Oh, boy. Well, we knew this was coming.
Let's hear it.

09:45.565 --> 09:49.433
I will not dignify the president's
petty remarks with a response.

09:49.519 --> 09:50.734
And yet he's responding.

09:50.853 --> 09:52.353
<i>I do, however, want to point out</i>

09:52.438 --> 09:54.155
that over 29 million people

09:54.240 --> 09:56.607
suffer from various forms of diabetes.

09:56.692 --> 10:00.027
- Oh, who cares?
- What truly troubles me, however,

10:00.113 --> 10:02.746
is President Meyer's timid response

10:02.865 --> 10:05.416
to a clear act of aggression.

10:05.535 --> 10:07.785
Did you just see that? Okay?

10:07.870 --> 10:09.537
We're gonna have to do
something about China now.

10:09.622 --> 10:11.455
- No, you don't, ma'am.
- <i> I need to look strong.</i>

10:11.541 --> 10:13.624
- If we lose Nevada...
<i>- "Nev-add-a."</i>

10:13.709 --> 10:16.510
...O'Brien is gonna kill us in
the House over this China thing.

10:16.596 --> 10:18.546
In reality, ma'am, China...

10:18.631 --> 10:20.714
In reality? I know reality, Ben.

10:20.850 --> 10:23.050
You're the one who suggested
we all live in the Matrix.

10:23.186 --> 10:25.462
Ma'am, nobody chose
to live in the Matrix.

10:25.487 --> 10:26.244
What?

10:26.305 --> 10:29.056
The machines rose up and
placed humans in the Matrix

10:29.142 --> 10:31.609
so they could use them as a
biological power source.

10:31.727 --> 10:34.728
- Whose side were you on?
- What about targeted sanctions?

10:34.864 --> 10:37.314
That will send a message of
real strength, won't it?

10:37.400 --> 10:40.734
Or we could go to the United
Nations and have them issue...

10:40.820 --> 10:44.205
Have them what? Have them help us
park in front of a fire hydrant?

10:44.290 --> 10:45.623
I mean, come on.

10:45.741 --> 10:48.209
Ma'am, your focus now
should be on Nevada.

10:48.294 --> 10:50.961
I'm president, in case you forgot.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.964
I know what I should focus on.

10:54.083 --> 10:55.583
Sorry, ma'am.

10:59.422 --> 11:01.172
Jesus, you're still here?

11:01.257 --> 11:03.057
I don't know why. My
only jobs seem to be

11:03.142 --> 11:05.476
asking Bob and finding
out what Bob thinks.

11:05.595 --> 11:07.645
Yeah, it's been pretty fun to watch.

11:07.763 --> 11:09.647
So you want to grab a
drink or something?

11:09.765 --> 11:11.932
No, thanks.

11:12.068 --> 11:14.318
Oh, but on your way,
would you mind stopping

11:14.437 --> 11:16.270
at ABC News and picking up some Advil?

11:16.405 --> 11:18.322
Oh, did I say ABC News?
I meant Rite Aid.

11:18.441 --> 11:19.857
Yeah, I think you're
forgetting something, Amy,

11:19.942 --> 11:22.359
is that I still had sex
with your sister, so...

11:22.445 --> 11:24.662
<i>Good night, have a pleasant evening,</i>

11:24.780 --> 11:26.780
and I had sex with your sister.

11:26.916 --> 11:30.584
<i>You might actually want to go
to Rite Aid. Get some Valtrex.</i>

11:35.208 --> 11:36.874
Dan?

11:44.767 --> 11:46.684
- Hello?
- Oh!

11:46.802 --> 11:48.636
Bob, I didn't know you were still here.

11:48.771 --> 11:50.354
Yeah. When's the meeting?

11:50.473 --> 11:52.098
The Whitman meeting's
tomorrow afternoon.

11:52.123 --> 11:52.664
Tomorrow.

11:52.725 --> 11:55.893
You might want to go to your
hotel and get some sleep.

11:55.978 --> 11:58.445
No, I got some more work to do.

11:58.531 --> 12:00.064
You have a good one, Jamie.

12:04.570 --> 12:07.037
<i>Mike McLintock.
I have a reservation.</i>

12:07.156 --> 12:09.490
The McLintock party has
already been seated.

12:09.625 --> 12:12.660
No, no, that's impossible
'cause he's Mike McLintock.

12:12.745 --> 12:14.328
Show her your driver's license.

12:14.413 --> 12:16.664
- I can't find it.
- Again?

12:16.749 --> 12:19.383
Uh, where exactly is
the McLintock party?

12:19.502 --> 12:20.751
Right over there.

12:22.338 --> 12:24.388
This is my table.

12:24.507 --> 12:26.340
And this is my fat johnson
and you can suck it

12:26.425 --> 12:29.093
as long as you promise not to put
your dirty gay mustache on it.

12:29.178 --> 12:31.145
What is that, some kind of side
effect from your AIDS medication

12:31.230 --> 12:33.347
or did you shave it off of
Freddie Mercury's corpse?

12:33.482 --> 12:35.899
Now, if you don't mind, I'd like
to enjoy my bay scallop gateau.

12:36.018 --> 12:40.070
You, you're a bald jerk.
Pardon me, Mrs. Furlong.

12:40.189 --> 12:42.489
Jesus, you think I married that?

12:42.575 --> 12:43.691
That's Will's wife.

12:43.826 --> 12:45.359
Hi, Mike. It's good to see you.

12:45.444 --> 12:47.027
This is my wife Mary.

12:47.163 --> 12:48.912
The congressman was kind enough

12:49.031 --> 12:50.864
to take us out to dinner
on our anniversary.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.200
- Hello.
- I guess Will likes them old.

12:53.336 --> 12:55.336
Why don't you fuck off
back to Burger King?

12:55.421 --> 12:57.788
- Happy anniversary.
- Hi, Wendy.

12:57.873 --> 12:59.456
We're going. We're going.

12:59.542 --> 13:01.258
Christ, she looks like a Batman villain.

13:01.377 --> 13:03.794
What'd Dopey get you
for your anniversary?

13:03.879 --> 13:06.213
<i>And when I'm president,</i>

13:06.299 --> 13:09.099
we will defend our digital borders

13:09.218 --> 13:14.388
<i>just as diligently as we
defend our physical ones.</i>

13:14.523 --> 13:16.974
Yeah, can I get a secure line?

13:17.059 --> 13:19.276
Bradley.

13:19.395 --> 13:21.445
<i>Bob, oh, God, I
hope I'm not waking you.</i>

13:21.564 --> 13:23.147
No, no, I'm always awake.

13:23.232 --> 13:25.532
<i>Great. So this China thing.</i>

13:25.618 --> 13:27.951
They did hack us,

13:28.070 --> 13:32.573
but they didn't exactly
hack my Twitter account.

13:32.658 --> 13:35.042
- Say no more, Madam President.
-<i> Oh, God, I knew it.</i>

13:35.127 --> 13:37.077
<i>I knew you would understand, Bob.</i>

13:37.163 --> 13:39.580
<i>It is so nice to finally be
talking to a professional here.</i>

13:39.665 --> 13:42.750
This is how I see it, okay?
If I'm soft on China,

13:42.885 --> 13:44.501
I'm gonna get killed in the House.

13:44.587 --> 13:46.470
Your instincts are telling
you you should be strong.

13:46.589 --> 13:49.006
Yes, you think my instincts are right?

13:49.091 --> 13:50.641
Does a bear piss in the shower?

13:50.760 --> 13:52.559
- <i> You should lead.</i>
- I'm the leader.

13:52.645 --> 13:54.978
- You caught the fish, now gut the fish.
- Gut the fish.

13:55.064 --> 13:57.598
You're wearing the fireman's
hat, now put out the fire.

13:57.733 --> 14:01.235
- Yes! This is better than phone sex.
-<i> Well, I just came.</i>

14:01.320 --> 14:03.604
Forget threatening sanctions.

14:03.739 --> 14:06.523
I should call on Congress
directly to levy them.

14:06.609 --> 14:08.192
That's a bold move, Madam President,

14:08.277 --> 14:10.110
and one that'll only earn you respect.

14:10.246 --> 14:12.162
Bob, thank you so much.

14:12.281 --> 14:14.114
Well, I'll be around for the next

14:14.250 --> 14:17.117
five to six hours if you
need anything else.

14:18.371 --> 14:20.954
That is why today I am announcing

14:21.090 --> 14:23.924
a set of unilateral sanctions

14:24.009 --> 14:27.010
starting with the freezing of all assets

14:27.129 --> 14:30.297
associated with the
Chinese state-sponsored

14:30.383 --> 14:33.133
cyberespionage apparatus.

14:33.269 --> 14:36.603
Thank you.

14:40.810 --> 14:43.143
Well, that seems to have
shut O'Brien up, huh?

14:43.229 --> 14:45.813
- There's a new stegosaurus.
- That's not my problem.

14:45.898 --> 14:48.365
- Absolutely, ma'am.
- Right. Hey, Amy.

14:48.484 --> 14:50.534
You all set for today's meeting?

14:50.653 --> 14:52.736
Ma'am, have you noticed...

14:52.822 --> 14:55.239
God, please back up
your face, Amy, okay?

14:55.324 --> 14:56.824
<i>Back it up.</i>

14:56.959 --> 14:59.326
Have you noticed anything
weird about Bob?

14:59.412 --> 15:01.044
<i>He was acting a little off last night.</i>

15:01.163 --> 15:02.629
That's just Bob being Bob.

15:02.715 --> 15:04.498
No, I know what this is about.

15:04.583 --> 15:08.385
Amy, you know that you are very
important to the campaign, right?

15:08.504 --> 15:09.699
-<i> No, this is not...</i>

15:09.724 --> 15:12.530
- No, Amy, listen, you
are doing a great job.

15:12.641 --> 15:16.260
A great, great, very good job.

15:16.345 --> 15:18.896
Ben, tell Amy what a great
job that she's doing.

15:19.014 --> 15:20.347
One heck of a job, Amy.

15:20.483 --> 15:22.816
If the Eagle told you that
the Eagle was acting odd,

15:22.902 --> 15:24.184
- would you listen to him?
- <i> Yeah.</i>

15:24.320 --> 15:25.769
You got to trust the Eagle.

15:25.855 --> 15:28.822
Why? Did he say something to you?

15:28.908 --> 15:31.191
<i>Is everybody's cell phone off?</i>

15:31.277 --> 15:33.360
Yeah. Those things cause
cancer, you know.

15:33.496 --> 15:35.552
That's what I hear.
Good to see you, Bob.

15:35.577 --> 15:36.604
Good to see you.

15:36.699 --> 15:38.999
- Been a while, huh?
- Yeah, it has indeed.

15:39.084 --> 15:42.870
I think the last time was at
your ski cabin with your wife.

15:43.005 --> 15:44.872
I still got the cabin.

15:47.176 --> 15:51.094
So, Bob, neither of us have time to
waste with the certification so close.

15:51.213 --> 15:52.379
What's on your mind?

15:52.465 --> 15:54.548
What we have here is a classic thumb

15:54.633 --> 15:57.885
in the apple pie situation
and Grandma is mad as hell.

15:57.970 --> 15:59.720
- She spent all day cooking...
- Look, Bob. Bob.

15:59.805 --> 16:02.689
We all know you're as folksy
as a butter churn lamp,

16:02.775 --> 16:04.525
but let me cut to the chase.

16:04.610 --> 16:06.727
From where I'm sitting, my boy's ahead.

16:06.862 --> 16:10.647
If you're here to beg for more time,
take your cup and cane elsewhere.

16:11.901 --> 16:13.901
Hold that thought.

16:26.799 --> 16:28.549
<i>- The gown is just gorgeous.</i>
<i>- I know.</i>

16:28.634 --> 16:30.217
- Did this come from India?
- I don't know. Did you get it?

16:30.302 --> 16:32.669
Just all of this just
screams Grace Kelly.

16:32.755 --> 16:34.338
- I know.
- Charlie is gonna flip.

16:34.423 --> 16:35.973
- I don't like my eyes, though.
- What?

16:36.091 --> 16:38.725
Yeah, I feel like I've got
two diaper bags underneath.

16:38.811 --> 16:40.844
- No, no, no, no. I don't think...
- Oh, God.

16:40.930 --> 16:42.563
- I need my ring.
- Okay.

16:43.899 --> 16:45.516
<i>- Oh, Bob.</i>
- Evening.

16:45.601 --> 16:47.935
Hi, you're getting ready to go
to the Whitman meeting, right?

16:48.020 --> 16:49.820
Mm-hmm, there's never
been a Whitman's Sampler

16:49.939 --> 16:52.990
I couldn't take apart piece by piece
and shit out, Madam President.

16:53.108 --> 16:56.076
I love to hear that. Okay, you're
hanging on to me like a skin tag.

16:56.161 --> 16:59.580
Hey, you know what? Could you go and tell
Charlie I'll be just a couple minutes?

16:59.665 --> 17:01.198
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
- Thank you very much.

17:01.283 --> 17:03.534
<i>So listen, I talked to
Kent and he really needs</i>

17:03.619 --> 17:06.286
as much time as possible,
so whatever you could do

17:06.372 --> 17:10.040
to buy more time to delay
the certifica... Bob?

17:10.125 --> 17:13.794
Bob? Are you all right? Can you hear me?

17:13.929 --> 17:17.180
- Is there someone in here?
- <i> What?</i>

17:17.299 --> 17:20.267
- What is this?
- Bob, is Richard there?

17:21.637 --> 17:23.303
Bob, are you okay?

17:23.388 --> 17:25.188
Oh, fuck. You know what?

17:25.307 --> 17:28.859
<i>I wonder... I think maybe we
should delay the meeting.</i>

17:28.978 --> 17:30.644
Oh, not a chance, Mr. President.

17:30.779 --> 17:33.280
- I'm locked and loaded.
- Madam President.

17:33.365 --> 17:36.900
A lady president? Yeah,
maybe in the year 2000.

17:36.986 --> 17:40.621
Bob! Oh, my God. Jesus Christ!

17:40.706 --> 17:43.407
- Mr. Baird, Mr. Baird. I'm so sorry.
- Excuse me.

17:43.492 --> 17:46.493
I know everybody's waiting, but she just
texted and she's running a little bit late.

17:46.629 --> 17:49.079
You sure she just texted or did
she tweet the entire world?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.549
It's okay, she's not here.

17:52.668 --> 17:54.334
All right, then let's just sit down.

17:54.420 --> 17:56.053
- Wait, you want...
- It's fine. It's fine.

17:56.171 --> 17:57.671
- She won't care.
- I don't know if...

17:57.806 --> 17:59.923
Howard, would you do me a favor
and slide over for my pal?

18:00.009 --> 18:00.592
Sure.

18:00.617 --> 18:02.366
I don't know if this
is such a good idea.

18:02.428 --> 18:05.512
It's 250 grand. I bought the table.
Sit down.

18:05.598 --> 18:08.148
Gary is a key member of
the Meyer administration.

18:08.233 --> 18:10.100
So kind. Thank you.

18:10.185 --> 18:13.320
- You have a card?
- No, just a bag.

18:13.405 --> 18:16.106
Guys, something is
deeply wrong with Bob.

18:16.191 --> 18:16.712
What?

18:16.737 --> 18:18.299
<i>I'm talking like blood
in the urine wrong.</i>

18:18.360 --> 18:19.910
Yes, that's what I've
been trying to tell you.

18:20.029 --> 18:22.529
No, not now, Amy, okay?
Just focus on this.

18:22.665 --> 18:24.531
Amy, this is really bad.

18:24.667 --> 18:26.199
Oh, hello, ma'am.

18:26.335 --> 18:29.836
- What's bad?
- Can I tell Amy and have her tell you?

18:29.922 --> 18:31.838
Jonah, just speak. What is it?

18:31.924 --> 18:34.207
Ma'am, I've been trying to get Mr.
Bradley on the phone

18:34.343 --> 18:36.043
with Ned Mitchell from
the "Las Vegas Gazette."

18:36.178 --> 18:39.262
- Right.
-<i> Ned Mitchell died in 2006.</i>

18:39.381 --> 18:41.695
And the "Las Vegas Gazette"
stopped publishing in 2007.

18:41.720 --> 18:42.490
Oh, my God.

18:42.551 --> 18:45.852
<i>I was able to get in touch with
Susan Bailey at the "Reno Star,"</i>

18:45.938 --> 18:49.306
which is not a newspaper,
it's a legal brothel.

18:49.391 --> 18:52.693
<i>But she did seem excited to help the
campaign in whichever way she could.</i>

18:52.778 --> 18:54.311
Jesus Christ, ma'am. I'm so sorry.

18:54.396 --> 18:56.563
He just seemed like the
same old Bob to me.

18:56.649 --> 18:59.399
Ma'am, this morning he told
me the Jews cause hurricanes.

18:59.485 --> 19:01.535
He just went into this
Whitman meeting, you guys!

19:01.620 --> 19:04.071
What if he takes a shit on
the table or something?

19:04.206 --> 19:07.491
Ma'am, at his age, if he can take a shit
whenever he wants, that's a major victory.

19:07.576 --> 19:09.576
All right, Amy, this
meeting cannot make it

19:09.662 --> 19:11.328
past the School Book Depository.

19:11.413 --> 19:13.246
I'm loading my gun and
heading to the sixth floor.

19:13.332 --> 19:15.916
<i>Well, then, go, go, go!
Ben, don't hang up.</i>

19:16.001 --> 19:17.884
- I've got to tell you something.
-<i> Uh-oh.</i>

19:17.970 --> 19:21.555
Bob knows there wasn't a Chinese hack.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.724
I think I might have told him.

19:23.809 --> 19:25.425
Well, don't worry, ma'am.

19:25.511 --> 19:27.477
We'll get him on the first
flight out of Nevada

19:27.596 --> 19:31.398
and we'll shove his ass out
somewhere over Oklahoma.

19:31.483 --> 19:35.185
Alzheimer's or no, I
image-searched Susan Bailey

19:35.270 --> 19:37.354
and she is legit fuckable.

19:37.439 --> 19:39.106
<i>Hi, this is Dan, leave a message.</i>

19:39.191 --> 19:40.774
Shit! Thing Two.

19:40.909 --> 19:42.609
Honestly, her rates are reasonable.

19:46.498 --> 19:48.498
Richard, call...

19:48.617 --> 19:49.483
Can you go any faster?

19:49.508 --> 19:51.358
Amy, if you had rented
me a Sebring, yes.

19:51.453 --> 19:52.703
Just go! Go, go!

19:54.506 --> 19:57.457
This is like that famous
scene from the movie "Heat."

19:57.593 --> 20:00.010
You know, with De Niro and Brenneman.

20:00.129 --> 20:02.763
Just thinking about that
scene gives me goose bumps.

20:02.848 --> 20:05.215
The fuck is going on?

20:05.300 --> 20:08.301
Mr. Whitman, sir, I'm sure that Mr.
Bradley

20:08.437 --> 20:10.804
<i>will be right back</i>

20:10.889 --> 20:13.440
very soon.

20:13.525 --> 20:15.809
<i>You know, I'm just gonna step out,</i>

20:15.944 --> 20:18.311
make sure that Bob
doesn't need anything.

20:18.397 --> 20:20.197
<i>Be right back.</i>

20:22.534 --> 20:24.985
Good evening, everyone. Before we start,

20:25.070 --> 20:27.537
I would like to acknowledge the
chairman of tonight's dinner

20:27.656 --> 20:31.291
and a longtime generous benefactor
of this unique institution,

20:31.376 --> 20:34.161
- <i> Mr. Charles Baird Jr.</i>
- Oh!

20:37.166 --> 20:40.383
Thank you, Steve. I'd
like to say dig in,

20:40.502 --> 20:42.169
but my date is running late.

20:42.254 --> 20:44.471
Presidents, right?

20:44.506 --> 20:47.591
Well, hopefully she arrives
before we all turn into fossils.

20:49.344 --> 20:51.762
<i>Why is nobody answering
their phones right now?</i>

20:51.847 --> 20:54.014
Hang on, ma'am. I'm gonna try Dan again.

20:54.099 --> 20:56.149
- Hey.
<i>- Dan, you're on with the...</i>

20:56.235 --> 20:58.318
Dan, are your ears on mute?

20:58.403 --> 20:59.986
I've called you like 80 times.

21:00.072 --> 21:02.105
- You're on with the president.
<i>- Sorry, ma'am.</i>

21:02.191 --> 21:05.192
Whitman made us turn our phones off
before Bob walked out of the meeting.

21:05.327 --> 21:07.027
What do you mean? The meeting is over?

21:07.112 --> 21:08.945
Well, no, but that didn't stop the Eagle

21:09.031 --> 21:11.364
from flying out onto the
street and getting in a cab.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.533
Yeah, turns out he's nuttier
than a squirrel's diaper.

21:13.619 --> 21:15.752
<i>- Tell Jonah to shut the fuck up.</i>
- Shut the fuck up.

21:15.871 --> 21:18.088
<i>If the meeting's still
going on, who's with Whitman?</i>

21:18.207 --> 21:21.291
- Richard.
- Oh, thank God.

21:21.376 --> 21:23.126
<i>Hate to say I told you so.</i>

21:23.212 --> 21:26.046
- Shut the fuck up.
- Shut the fuck up, Jonah.

21:27.633 --> 21:30.050
Mr. Splett, where's Bob Bradley?

21:30.185 --> 21:31.852
Honestly, I was gonna ask you that.

21:31.887 --> 21:33.386
Do you mind if I get a picture with you

21:33.522 --> 21:35.355
for my blog "Let's Talk About Splett"?

21:36.892 --> 21:39.442
Tell the Eagle it was great to see him.

21:39.561 --> 21:41.144
And at 6:00 P.M. tomorrow,

21:41.230 --> 21:43.897
every vote in this state will
be counted and certified.

21:44.032 --> 21:47.067
Well, not every vote. Funny
thing about elections,

21:47.152 --> 21:48.902
historically there've always
been leftover ballots.

21:49.037 --> 21:52.956
Sometimes up to 16% end
up missing or thrown out.

21:53.075 --> 21:55.742
- Is that what this is about?
- I'm so sorry for...

21:55.878 --> 21:58.078
The missing ballots in Washoe County.

21:58.163 --> 22:00.831
We looked all over for
them, came up empty,

22:00.916 --> 22:02.549
so best of luck to you.

22:02.634 --> 22:05.719
And if you do happen to find
as much as one new vote,

22:05.804 --> 22:08.338
- we'll see you in court.
- Thank you.

22:09.675 --> 22:12.425
Holy bacon double Asperger's.

22:12.511 --> 22:14.261
- How did you do that?
- I'm sorry, what?

22:14.396 --> 22:17.681
Amy, what are your top five
favorite De Niro movies?

22:17.766 --> 22:20.400
And you can't say "Meet the Parents"
'cause that's automatically number one.

22:20.485 --> 22:23.937
Kent, it's Washoe County.
Don't ask me how I know.

22:24.022 --> 22:26.773
<i>Kent, get the Justice
Department on this, okay?</i>

22:26.909 --> 22:29.609
You give them your statistical
whatever it is to narrow it down.

22:29.695 --> 22:32.028
- You mean my data narrative matrices.
- Yeah, the datas.

22:32.114 --> 22:36.166
Amy, is there any sign of the Eagle or
is he crossing America on a lawn mower?

22:36.285 --> 22:38.501
Ma'am, we really ought to get
someone in court right away

22:38.620 --> 22:40.620
to file a Hail Mary injunction
to extend the deadline,

22:40.756 --> 22:42.289
someone who can stall
till we find the ballots.

22:42.424 --> 22:43.623
<i>I already thought about that.</i>

22:43.759 --> 22:45.458
<i>I've got it covered.</i>

22:51.216 --> 22:53.099
Mm-hmm.

22:57.105 --> 22:59.139
So the lady-in-waiting came over to us

22:59.274 --> 23:03.476
and she said, "Her Majesty thought perhaps
you would like to see her crown."

23:03.562 --> 23:06.396
Imagine a shy kid from
Birmingham, Alabama,

23:06.481 --> 23:07.981
and the Queen of England...

23:08.066 --> 23:10.617
Ladies and gentlemen, the
President of the United States.

23:10.702 --> 23:13.570
Oh, thank you.

23:13.655 --> 23:15.538
Thank you. Oh, look at that.

23:15.657 --> 23:18.325
That's sort of a grey-blue dress.
Isn't that something?

23:18.410 --> 23:20.961
Hi, feeling good in Nevada.

23:21.046 --> 23:23.880
Nifty in Nevada. Hi.

23:23.999 --> 23:26.800
- You look fantastic.
- Yeah, I need a drink.

23:26.885 --> 23:30.003
Indeed I do. Everybody,
please, sit down.

23:30.088 --> 23:33.673
I am so excited to hear all about the...

23:33.759 --> 23:36.009
Stegosaurus, the armored plant eater.

23:36.094 --> 23:38.895
- Stegosaurus, the arm... Gary?
- Mm-hmm.

23:39.014 --> 23:42.649
I dropped my lipstick somewhere
between here and the motorcade.

23:42.734 --> 23:45.018
- Okay, I got one right here.
- No, go get that one.

23:45.153 --> 23:47.103
- Uh-huh.
- So what did I miss?

23:47.189 --> 23:50.190
We just heard a lovely story
about the Queen of England.

23:50.325 --> 23:52.025
She's a fucking cunt.

23:52.160 --> 23:54.027
- You didn't hear it from me.
- No.

23:55.998 --> 23:58.832
We're still searching for the
votes, so we need you to stall.

23:58.917 --> 24:00.617
Amy, I respect the sanctity

24:00.702 --> 24:03.370
of this courtroom far
too much to "stall."

24:03.505 --> 24:06.039
This is a simple and
straightforward case.

24:06.124 --> 24:09.259
Although, in many ways, that's
what makes it so complicated.

24:09.378 --> 24:12.178
- You see...
- That's good. Do that.

24:12.264 --> 24:14.965
The court will hear the
matter of Meyer v. Nevada,

24:15.050 --> 24:16.850
a motion to delay certification.

24:16.935 --> 24:20.720
Before we begin, I would love
to define a few key terms.

24:20.806 --> 24:24.474
Vote. What is a vote?

24:24.559 --> 24:26.393
Well, I think that's pretty obvious.

24:26.528 --> 24:28.228
Oh, is it, Your Honor?

24:28.363 --> 24:33.283
In many cultures, the word vote
can mean a myriad of things.

24:33.402 --> 24:35.986
It can mean a celebration.

24:36.071 --> 24:38.154
It can mean a dance around a fire.

24:38.240 --> 24:41.408
It can mean a silent nod.

24:41.543 --> 24:44.911
In this room, what does it mean?

24:44.997 --> 24:46.579
Any news on Creaky McGee?

24:46.715 --> 24:48.748
Seriously, we have got
to find Bob before...

24:48.834 --> 24:51.134
Look at this. How beautiful you look.
And check this out.

24:51.253 --> 24:53.586
No, no. What about the
Nevada State Police?

24:53.672 --> 24:55.922
- Ma'am, there's nothing.
- <i> Oh, never mind. We got him.</i>

24:56.008 --> 24:57.724
What? Where is he?

24:57.809 --> 25:00.310
- Here.
- Good morning.

25:00.429 --> 25:02.345
Hi, Bob.

25:02.431 --> 25:03.813
- Hey.
- <i> Hi.</i>

25:03.932 --> 25:06.433
I am so happy to see you.

25:06.568 --> 25:08.435
What kind of soup do you have today?

25:08.520 --> 25:13.106
Um, what kind of soup is on your mind?

25:13.191 --> 25:15.075
Well, what is today?

25:15.160 --> 25:17.861
- Um... it's Thursday.
- It's Thursday.

25:17.946 --> 25:19.446
- Thursday?
- Yup.

25:19.531 --> 25:22.582
Navy bean. So delicious.

25:22.667 --> 25:25.335
Ma'am, you want to... hey, Bob.

25:25.454 --> 25:27.170
Bob Bradley. Nice to meet you, sir.

25:27.289 --> 25:29.839
- They found the ballots.
- Seriously?

25:29.958 --> 25:33.877
- Yeah.
- Excuse me, Bob.

25:33.962 --> 25:35.595
Breaking news out of Nevada.

25:35.680 --> 25:38.465
<i>Acting on a tip, US Justice
Department deputies</i>

25:38.550 --> 25:42.302
found an estimated 10,000
uncounted mail-in ballots

25:42.387 --> 25:44.075
from last week's
presidential election...

25:44.100 --> 25:44.661
Come on.

25:44.773 --> 25:48.691
<i>...in the house of this man, 54-year-old
US postal worker Vance Otlow.</i>

25:48.777 --> 25:51.444
- Look at this guy.
-<i> Otlow had grown more erratic</i>

25:51.530 --> 25:53.813
following post office closures last year

25:53.899 --> 25:55.815
by the Meyer Postal Commission.

25:55.901 --> 25:57.484
10,000 ballots!

25:57.619 --> 26:01.955
From a district with an empirically
high applied demography value.

26:02.040 --> 26:05.742
I don't know what you're saying, but
you keep doing that math stuff, Kent,

26:05.827 --> 26:07.677
no matter how much anyone
makes fun of you, okay?

26:07.702 --> 26:08.318
Yes, ma'am.

26:08.380 --> 26:12.165
All right, listen. Karen has got to
get those ballots admitted, right?

26:12.250 --> 26:14.501
She will or she won't.

26:14.636 --> 26:17.420
Amy, I know the last couple
days have not been ideal.

26:17.506 --> 26:19.389
To say the least, ma'am.

26:19.508 --> 26:20.840
<i>I just want you to know</i>

26:20.926 --> 26:23.593
that I could not have
done it without Richard

26:23.678 --> 26:26.679
and I want you to please
relay my thanks to him.

26:26.815 --> 26:29.182
I'll get right on that.

26:29.267 --> 26:31.401
Uh, ma'am, from our ambassador in China.

26:31.520 --> 26:34.687
As I feared, the Chinese are responding
to your threat of sanctions.

26:34.773 --> 26:37.440
Can I not have just one
minute to enjoy this?

26:37.526 --> 26:39.692
I'll ask the Chinese.

26:39.828 --> 26:41.995
Your Honors, I have just been informed

26:42.080 --> 26:45.949
that uncounted ballots have been
discovered in Washoe County.

26:46.034 --> 26:48.701
I'd like to move that those
be included in the recount.

26:48.837 --> 26:51.538
Objection, the deadline
has already passed.

26:51.673 --> 26:55.508
Your Honor, how is counsel
defining "deadline" and "passed"?

26:55.594 --> 26:57.677
Your Honor, objection!

26:59.014 --> 27:00.463
The deadline will be extended

27:00.549 --> 27:02.048
until we can hear on this matter.

27:02.134 --> 27:05.969
We will reconvene tomorrow at 10:00 A.M.

27:06.054 --> 27:08.938
After today's stunning
turn of events in Nevada,

27:09.057 --> 27:11.441
the president has asked
Bob Bradley, the Eagle,

27:11.560 --> 27:13.393
to return to Washington as her new

27:13.478 --> 27:16.563
cybersecurity czar,
effective immediately.

27:16.648 --> 27:19.065
Also the State Department is reporting

27:19.151 --> 27:22.569
the Chinese government announced a
series of measures aimed at the US.

27:22.654 --> 27:25.572
New restrictions on American
imports into China,

27:25.657 --> 27:28.658
freezing of US investment
funds in China...

27:30.212 --> 27:34.047
a ban on all foreign adoptions
by American citizens.

27:35.634 --> 27:38.218
- A bunch of other stuff.
- Mike! Mike!

27:38.303 --> 27:40.920
Will the president move
forward with her sanctions?

27:41.006 --> 27:42.589
I don't know.

27:45.177 --> 27:47.310
I have to call my wife.

27:49.648 --> 27:51.481
I didn't know there
was a subbasement.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.433
- Nice and cool.
- Yeah, it's nice.

27:53.568 --> 27:55.818
- A lot of supplies here.
- This is mine, right?

27:55.937 --> 27:57.437
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, boy.

27:57.522 --> 27:59.522
And here we go, Eagle, your new nest.

27:59.608 --> 28:02.358
Now, I don't think my cell
phone's gonna work here.

28:02.444 --> 28:04.911
- No. Good luck.
- Great.

28:06.448 --> 28:08.781
Thanks, buttfucker.
