WEBVTT

00:00.338 --> 00:03.060
RUXIN: Shiva Komedi
Somakanakram!

00:04.093 --> 00:06.770
It feels good to be back.
PETE: Oh, God.

00:06.904 --> 00:08.668
But maybe I won't win.
I mean, who am I playing in the

00:08.802 --> 00:10.891
Shiva Bowl this year?
We've known him as Tefl-Andre,

00:11.026 --> 00:13.220
because nothing sticks to him,
but you know what is going to

00:13.354 --> 00:16.754
stick to him?
The ropes and ropes of yogurt

00:16.888 --> 00:19.944
that I will cover his face with.
(groaning)

00:20.078 --> 00:23.195
Andre is going to walk away from
this Shiva Bowl loss looking

00:23.330 --> 00:26.625
like he got in an accident at a
custard factory.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.915
KEVIN: Unnecessary.
And so, the terrible reign of

00:30.049 --> 00:34.217
Ruxin begins anew!
(cackling)

00:34.351 --> 00:37.278
What are you doing?
Oh.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.666
Is this that stupid league of
yours again?

00:39.801 --> 00:41.861
(laughter)
Yeah, I'm just making a video

00:41.995 --> 00:43.856
because I'm in the finals.
Ooh.

00:43.990 --> 00:45.870
What do you want, a trophy?
We do have a trophy.

00:45.956 --> 00:47.486
It's the Shiva.
It's this Indian girl that we

00:47.617 --> 00:48.983
went to high school...
Who cares?!

00:49.117 --> 00:50.984
It's an eight-team league full
of morons.

00:51.119 --> 00:53.052
Congratulations.
You're king of the dipshits.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.849
Get back to work.
Yeah, I just got to...

00:54.984 --> 00:56.783
Get back to work!

00:59.344 --> 01:01.173
(whispering): I'm gonna be
the champion.

01:01.307 --> 01:03.811
Work!
I'm the champion.

01:04.035 --> 01:08.581

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:08.701 --> 01:10.916
Seriously, you're gonna hang
that right there?

01:11.036 --> 01:13.031
JENNY: Yeah, don't worry.
I got one for you, too.

01:13.166 --> 01:16.199
And sadly, it might be just as
appropriate next year.

01:16.333 --> 01:18.667
Well, 'tis the season for an
all-MacArthur Sacko Bowl.

01:18.801 --> 01:21.462
No, no, no, don't look at me.
It's all right here.

01:21.596 --> 01:23.824
I cannot believe that I'm in
the Sacko again.

01:23.959 --> 01:26.039
TACO: Yeah, my strategy
didn't work too well, either.

01:26.090 --> 01:28.410
You mean not changing your
lineup from the beginning of the

01:28.490 --> 01:30.723
season regardless of byes,
match-ups or injuries?

01:30.857 --> 01:34.820
(phones chirping)
An e-mail from the estate of

01:34.954 --> 01:37.355
Ted Rappaport?
Oh, shit. Here, pull it up.

01:37.490 --> 01:39.953
Hello, my name is Fredrick
Mandino, and I represent the

01:40.088 --> 01:42.318
estate of the late
Theodore Rappaport.

01:42.453 --> 01:44.734
Mr. Rappaport left his Laguna
Beach house to the winner of

01:44.850 --> 01:47.651
your fantasy football league,
and as your Shiva Bowl has

01:47.786 --> 01:50.652
arrived, he wanted you to see
what you were playing for.

01:50.785 --> 01:53.286
ALL: Whoa!
Oh, my God.

01:53.420 --> 01:55.489
I would leave my family for
that house.

01:55.623 --> 01:58.157
I would take your family for
that house.

01:58.292 --> 02:00.323
I have also sent you some
plane tickets, as Mr. Rappaport

02:00.457 --> 02:02.690
felt that since you were playing
for the house, you should be

02:02.823 --> 02:04.821
staying at the house.
What?!

02:04.955 --> 02:06.620
Holy shit, we're all flying
to California.

02:06.755 --> 02:08.519
Hold on, I have to check my
calendar.

02:08.654 --> 02:10.621
Mr. Rappaport then instructed
me to make a series of very

02:10.755 --> 02:13.056
obscene gestures which, for
professional reasons and some

02:13.190 --> 02:16.385
personal reasons, I would prefer
not to do over electronic media.

02:16.520 --> 02:19.852
Looks like we are going on a
Shiva Bowl road trip!

02:19.986 --> 02:21.784
Yeah, I'm free.

02:29.986 --> 02:32.353
ANDRE: F-First class?
Yeah, I used my miles from

02:32.488 --> 02:34.354
Korea to upgrade.
Hey, can I use your bathroom?

02:34.488 --> 02:37.287
If you use our bathroom, I
got to call the air marshal.

02:40.756 --> 02:42.555
Thank you.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.454
Thank you.
I'm good.

02:47.589 --> 02:50.123
Wasn't it so thoughtful of
Ted to get Shiva her own seat?

02:50.258 --> 02:52.657
Can I have Shiva's peanuts?
No!

02:52.790 --> 02:54.222
Andre, what are you doing
in coach?

02:54.356 --> 02:56.222
You always fly first class.
Well, after the debacle at

02:56.356 --> 02:58.290
Ménage à Cinq, money's been a
little bit tight.

02:58.424 --> 03:00.225
So I figured I'd fly coach.
It's not that bad at all.

03:00.359 --> 03:01.892
I mean, what, do I get the
champagne in the back?

03:02.026 --> 03:06.458
Yeah.
Okay, sounds great.

03:06.593 --> 03:08.826
All right, let's get onboard
here. Who do we want to

03:08.960 --> 03:10.726
win this beach house?
ALL: Andre.

03:10.860 --> 03:12.780
Yeah, I feel that.
If Ruxin wins, it'll be nicer,

03:12.828 --> 03:15.129
but we won't have access.
If Andre wins, it'll be super

03:15.263 --> 03:17.163
douchey, but we can do whatever
we want with it.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.363
And if I win, I'll let you
guys use it sometimes.

03:19.498 --> 03:22.299
You can't. You're out.
Well, I'm not giving up,

03:22.434 --> 03:24.300
guys.
You are mathematically

03:24.434 --> 03:26.067
eliminated.
And if I do win, I'm gonna

03:26.202 --> 03:30.300
open a second location in Laguna
Beach, the EBDBBnB LB.

03:30.434 --> 03:33.670
That's the spirit, Taco.
Why is anyone pretending this

03:33.806 --> 03:37.174
is a back massager?
Hello, sir. Can I get

03:37.308 --> 03:39.310
you a meal order tonight?
Yes, please.

03:39.444 --> 03:41.312
Can I have the chicken piccata?
I'm so sorry.

03:41.447 --> 03:43.247
We just gave the last one away.
The salmon's delicious,

03:43.382 --> 03:45.015
though.
It has a pink peppercorn sauce.

03:45.150 --> 03:46.852
I'll just have the chicken
piccata, please.

03:46.986 --> 03:48.666
I'm so sorry.
We just don't have enough for

03:48.788 --> 03:50.321
everyone to have their first
choice.

03:50.456 --> 03:52.189
What about the pilots?
Are they just gonna be given

03:52.323 --> 03:54.258
soda and imitation Chex Mix?
No, of course they get a

03:54.392 --> 03:56.262
meal.
And they're both having the

03:56.396 --> 03:58.330
salmon?
Um, no.

03:58.465 --> 04:00.331
One is and the other...
Is having the piccata?

04:00.465 --> 04:02.234
Well, so I'm gonna go talk to
the pilot and see if he'll

04:02.369 --> 04:03.889
switch with me.
Oh, sir, no, you can't.

04:03.906 --> 04:06.026
The seat belt sign is on, and
besides, he's very busy.

04:06.043 --> 04:07.709
He's flying the plane.
That's right, he is flying

04:07.844 --> 04:09.345
the plane.
So he doesn't want to be

04:09.479 --> 04:11.350
concentrating on something as
silly as what he's eating for

04:11.484 --> 04:13.385
dinner.
No, I guess not.

04:13.519 --> 04:15.186
So maybe in this particular
case, he's gonna have the

04:15.320 --> 04:17.689
salmon?
What do I tell him?

04:17.822 --> 04:19.791
I would just tell him, "I'm
sorry, but we don't have enough

04:19.926 --> 04:21.860
for everybody to get their first
choice."

04:21.994 --> 04:26.363
Okay.
Thank you.

04:26.497 --> 04:29.535
Now, that was impressive.
Oh, that was nothing.

04:29.669 --> 04:31.805
Can I ask what you do?
I'm a corporate lawyer, but

04:31.940 --> 04:34.242
I'm getting a little tired of
being a concierge of evil.

04:34.376 --> 04:37.213
Well, maybe I can help.
I'm Tom Condon.

04:37.347 --> 04:40.153
Tom Condon, super agent,
Tom Condon?

04:40.288 --> 04:42.923
Represents Drew Brees,
Eli Manning and Peyton Manning,

04:43.057 --> 04:44.993
Tom Condon?
You know, we're always

04:45.127 --> 04:47.262
looking out for new talent, and
if you can negotiate with teams

04:47.396 --> 04:50.561
the way you did with that flight
attendant, we may have something

04:50.695 --> 04:52.763
to talk about.
As a matter of fact, why don't

04:52.897 --> 04:54.931
you stop by my office while
you're on the coast.

04:55.066 --> 04:58.735
Yeah, okay, sure.
Psst, Ruxin.

04:58.870 --> 05:00.904
Get out of here, you flight
urchin.

05:01.039 --> 05:02.339
Ruxin.
Take a cookie, go.

05:02.473 --> 05:04.274
Ooh!

05:06.000 --> 05:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:16.666 --> 05:18.966
Oh, God, it's right on the
beach.

05:19.100 --> 05:21.970
Well, welcome, everyone.
Glad to have you here, if only

05:22.105 --> 05:25.044
to fulfill the wishes of a great
man, Mr. Theodore Rappaport.

05:25.164 --> 05:27.697
And he left specific
instructions that I be here for

05:27.832 --> 05:30.352
the weekend to monitor the Shiva
Bowl to make sure that no funny

05:30.370 --> 05:32.572
business occurs.
Oh, I can assure you, as

05:32.706 --> 05:35.026
commissioner of this league,
there has never been any funny

05:35.041 --> 05:36.907
business.
There was a negotiation of a

05:37.042 --> 05:38.909
man's prison sentence as you
exchanged number one draft

05:39.044 --> 05:40.913
picks?
I plead the Fifth.

05:41.048 --> 05:43.249
Allegedly.
You have abused the Make-A-

05:43.383 --> 05:46.653
Wish Foundation so that Josh
Cribbs would help your team.

05:46.787 --> 05:48.721
You know, I have one thing to
say to that.

05:48.854 --> 05:52.657
Cribbs!
ALL: Cribbs!

05:52.791 --> 05:54.988
Crabs!
Taco, you impersonated a

05:55.123 --> 05:57.643
notary public, ran a brothel and
illegally imported and exported

05:57.689 --> 06:00.357
Three Penis wine.
And, Kevin, I believe you

06:00.492 --> 06:02.653
ingested Mr. Rappaport's
medicinal cocktail in order to

06:02.728 --> 06:05.727
gain a quote-unquote,
"AIDS-vantage."

06:05.862 --> 06:10.534
Are there any more questions?
May I use the restroom?

06:10.669 --> 06:13.604
Yes.
Thank you.

06:18.507 --> 06:20.910
Hi, Kevin.
(squeals)

06:21.045 --> 06:23.206
How do you like the place?
Ted! Wait, no, you're, uh...

06:23.248 --> 06:25.115
Smarter than you.
Uh...

06:25.249 --> 06:26.950
Better looking?
No, you're...

06:27.085 --> 06:29.087
More money, more successful.
No, you're dead. You're dead.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.957
Oh, correct.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

06:31.092 --> 06:32.758
No, no, no, no, this-this cannot
be happening.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.860
But much like your low T and
terrible fantasy lineup, here we

06:34.994 --> 06:36.963
are.
If you really are a ghost,

06:37.097 --> 06:40.566
then I want a sign.
Why does everybody feel like

06:40.700 --> 06:43.132
they have to make the dead guy
jump through hoops?

06:43.267 --> 06:45.133
You're so tedious, man.
Here.

06:45.267 --> 06:49.472
(car horn honking)
Keep me a secret.

06:49.607 --> 06:52.206
I'll be back tonight.
Okay.

06:52.340 --> 06:55.275
How much did you see in here?
I came in at the scratching.

06:55.410 --> 06:58.412
That's okay.
(honking continues)

07:00.950 --> 07:03.085
Whoa!
(all groaning)

07:03.220 --> 07:05.389
This place is the tits!
What the hell is he doing

07:05.524 --> 07:07.293
here?
Mr. Rappaport's will

07:07.427 --> 07:09.127
stipulated that Rafi also be
flown out.

07:09.261 --> 07:11.141
Oh, God, he's screwing us
from beyond the grave.

07:11.228 --> 07:14.128
Hey, Brian!
Put this in our room.

07:14.262 --> 07:17.161
(shouting)
Where you going?

07:17.296 --> 07:19.795
(laughs)
That dumb dildo left us his cab.

07:19.929 --> 07:21.895
Rafi, why did the bag make
a squish?

07:22.030 --> 07:23.729
Oh, it's full of chicken livers.

07:23.863 --> 07:25.730
You mash them all together, and
then you have sex with them.

07:25.864 --> 07:27.928
It mimics the consistency of a
human vagina.

07:28.063 --> 07:30.296
I'm gonna be banging that bag
all weekend, bro.

07:30.430 --> 07:34.233
Squish, squish, splurt.
This is not the sign I was

07:34.367 --> 07:37.102
looking for.
So you're really gonna take

07:37.236 --> 07:39.437
this meeting with Tom Condon?
Yeah, I'm sick of working

07:39.572 --> 07:41.805
for that corn-fed monster
Bethesda anymore, and I'm not

07:41.940 --> 07:44.274
going back to Korea.
I win the league, get a new

07:44.409 --> 07:46.276
house, get a new job, new
beginning.

07:46.410 --> 07:48.110
Yeah, are you gonna bring the
whole family out?

07:48.245 --> 07:50.046
What's that now?
Your family, Sofia, Geoffrey.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.983
Does she even know you're here
with us?

07:52.117 --> 07:54.117
She knows that I'm on a work
trip, which it now turns out,

07:54.251 --> 07:55.919
I am.
Wow.

07:56.054 --> 07:58.121
So looking back, I've been
very straightforward with her.

07:58.256 --> 08:00.857
Great sports agent.
You guys notice anything

08:00.991 --> 08:03.026
weird about this house?
I saw Rafi pissing in my

08:03.160 --> 08:05.995
chest of drawers, but that's not
really out of the ordinary.

08:06.129 --> 08:08.765
Oh, Tall Guy, when am I gonna
stop hearing about this?

08:08.899 --> 08:12.604
I told you, I'm afraid of new
toilets, so I Goldilocksed all

08:12.739 --> 08:15.274
the new drawers in the house,
and yours was just right.

08:15.408 --> 08:17.541
Anyone run across my brother
at all today?

08:17.676 --> 08:19.543
Oh, you mean Tac Cousteau?
Yeah, he's out fishing on the

08:19.677 --> 08:21.544
pier, trying to get us some
dinner.

08:21.678 --> 08:23.612
What? I'll be back.
Bye.

08:23.748 --> 08:25.617
I hope he catches the
Little Mermaid, right?

08:25.751 --> 08:27.519
You ever seen anything as sexy
as that?

08:27.654 --> 08:29.353
Well, when they have the
tail, I'm not sure that you can

08:29.488 --> 08:31.356
do what you want to do there.
Oh, they've got fish biz

08:31.490 --> 08:33.524
down there, okay?
And all I want is to get

08:33.659 --> 08:36.326
involved with fish biz.
(chuckles)

08:36.460 --> 08:40.397
All right.
Oh, here comes Andre.

08:40.530 --> 08:42.700
Whew!
Hey, Andre.

08:42.832 --> 08:44.197
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey.

08:44.332 --> 08:45.895
We actually have something we
want to talk to you about.

08:46.029 --> 08:47.495
All right, yeah, what do you
got?

08:47.629 --> 08:49.660
I would like to offer you my
personal advice on your fantasy

08:49.795 --> 08:51.696
lineup.
Me, too.

08:51.830 --> 08:53.563
Really?
But when you win, I get use

08:53.698 --> 08:55.965
of this beach house one month a
year.

08:56.099 --> 08:58.234
I also get use for a month,
and it has to be a summer month.

08:58.368 --> 09:00.169
Ooh, I want a summer month.
Yeah, it's totally fine.

09:00.303 --> 09:01.864
I mean, there's plenty of room
in there.

09:01.937 --> 09:03.572
You take the top, I'll take the
bottom, whatever.

09:03.707 --> 09:05.574
Yeah, no, I was thinking you
probably wouldn't be there.

09:05.709 --> 09:07.578
Yeah, more of a solo thing.
Yeah.

09:07.715 --> 09:10.017
Okay, yes, yes.
All right.

09:10.151 --> 09:11.987
I want your advice.
Here you go.

09:12.121 --> 09:13.988
All right.
(chuckles) I like that.

09:14.122 --> 09:15.521
Right?
I like that.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.655
Of course I'm playing Antonio
Gates as tight end.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.858
Pictures.
Oh! Bikini shot, huh?

09:19.992 --> 09:21.860
What?
Jenny bikini shot.

09:21.994 --> 09:23.927
Stop it, Andre.
I was packing. Give it to me.

09:24.061 --> 09:26.029
You don't look through someone
else's phone.

09:26.163 --> 09:28.083
You just handed it to me.
It's like going through

09:28.197 --> 09:29.896
someone's medicine cabinet,
Andre!

09:30.031 --> 09:31.932
I can look through people's
medicine cabinets. I'm a doctor.

09:32.067 --> 09:34.003
No, you can't!
Enough, enough.

09:34.138 --> 09:36.039
You guys, come here.
Think about the match-ups.

09:36.173 --> 09:38.710
It's good, right?
Oakland, I mean, come on.

09:38.844 --> 09:41.079
What if I...
See this?

09:41.213 --> 09:43.215
Yeah, yeah, of course. Yes!
Right?

09:43.350 --> 09:45.851
I smell collusion.
I never would've...

09:45.986 --> 09:48.853
(sighs)
Hey, Taco, I've got to talk

09:48.988 --> 09:51.954
to you about the Sacko Bowl.
Oh, hey, brother.

09:52.089 --> 09:54.625
I can't win the Sacko for two
years in a row, okay?

09:54.760 --> 09:56.729
I can't be hammered like that
again.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.899
Yeah, you definitely can't.
That's gonna be bad.

09:59.034 --> 10:00.902
Well, that's why I need your
help, all right? You got to...

10:01.036 --> 10:03.438
You got to take a dive.
What do you mean, take a

10:03.572 --> 10:05.408
dive?
I need you to lose on

10:05.543 --> 10:08.144
purpose.
You need me to cheat.

10:08.278 --> 10:09.879
It's not really cheating, Taco.

10:10.013 --> 10:11.916
I mean, you don't even care
about this league.

10:12.051 --> 10:14.387
I don't care about this
league, but there's one thing I

10:14.521 --> 10:16.389
do care about.
And that's you.

10:16.523 --> 10:18.443
You've never really done
anything with your life.

10:18.525 --> 10:20.793
Your career isn't working,
your marriage isn't working,

10:20.927 --> 10:23.062
and your dick's not even
working.

10:23.197 --> 10:24.965
My dick is back to normal, okay?

10:25.100 --> 10:27.101
Oh, that is nothing to brag
about.

10:27.236 --> 10:28.969
Part of this is my fault.
What?

10:29.103 --> 10:31.070
I've been too easy on you.
But no more.

10:31.205 --> 10:33.907
I am gonna try my very hardest
to beat you this week.

10:34.041 --> 10:36.142
I am gonna make you work for
this win.

10:36.277 --> 10:38.145
You need to toughen up, you
little bitch!

10:38.280 --> 10:40.481
What?
I-I'm a tough guy!

10:40.616 --> 10:42.816
I am!
(scoffs)

10:42.950 --> 10:44.850
My God, why did I think this was
gonna work?

10:44.985 --> 10:49.021
(growling)
(screams)

10:49.155 --> 10:52.023
What the shit?!
What are you doing, Taco?!

10:52.158 --> 10:54.624
I'm doing this because I love
you, brother.

10:54.758 --> 10:56.171
And don't shit in the water,
Seabiscuit.

10:56.291 --> 11:00.099
I'm not Seabiscuit!
One snuck out on impact.

11:04.947 --> 11:05.733
Hi, Kevin.

11:06.115 --> 11:08.214
You look real stupid when you
sleep.

11:08.349 --> 11:09.286
(gasps)
Is this real?

11:09.406 --> 11:12.455
You guys make a nice couple.
(groans)

11:12.639 --> 11:14.809
I need you to come with me.
Up there?

11:14.943 --> 11:17.945
Up?
Oh, buddy.

11:18.079 --> 11:20.149
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm a good person.

11:20.283 --> 11:22.349
Okay. To the balcony.
Oh.

11:22.484 --> 11:24.686
Yeah. Let's go.
Okay.

11:24.820 --> 11:26.453
Just take a quick look at
your wife.

11:26.587 --> 11:28.954
What? Hey, hey, hey, no!
Relax, okay?

11:29.089 --> 11:31.190
I'm not gonna give her ghost
AIDS.

11:31.324 --> 11:34.659
Ghost AIDS?
You guys can't catch a break.

11:34.794 --> 11:36.960
So Taco's gonna go for it
against you.

11:37.094 --> 11:39.161
He's got a good enough team.
I don't want to be the Sacko.

11:39.296 --> 11:41.656
I don't, not two years in a row.
I'm gonna help you win, but

11:41.662 --> 11:44.130
you got to do something for me.
What can I do for you?

11:44.265 --> 11:46.500
I want one more prank on
these guys.

11:46.634 --> 11:48.367
Why?
Why? You drafted on my

11:48.501 --> 11:50.901
embalmed body, you knocked over
the coffin, you had sex at my

11:50.935 --> 11:53.669
funeral.
Nope, nobody had sex, because

11:53.804 --> 11:55.970
nobody came.
Penetration is sex.

11:56.104 --> 11:58.339
No, I just put the tip in.
Kevin, you're all tip.

11:58.474 --> 12:00.394
That's not cool, man.
So you gonna do this for me

12:00.477 --> 12:01.878
or not?
Yes, what do you want to do?

12:02.013 --> 12:03.880
I'm thinking something fun,
and I'm just spit balling, but I

12:04.014 --> 12:05.747
heard Andre talking about his
cat.

12:05.881 --> 12:08.016
Can't do that.
We already did that one.

12:08.150 --> 12:10.051
You don't watch everything
up there?

12:10.185 --> 12:12.688
I'm not gonna watch Andre.
Oh. Hey, do you guys play

12:12.823 --> 12:14.758
fantasy football?
I'm in a 14-team fantasy

12:14.893 --> 12:16.862
league with Gandhi and the
Ultimate Warrior, yeah.

12:16.998 --> 12:18.767
No way.
There's no bye-weeks.

12:18.902 --> 12:20.302
Your best players never get
injured.

12:20.370 --> 12:21.837
Heaven.
You're not going.

12:21.971 --> 12:23.938
Are you in or out?
I'll do it, but I want to win

12:24.072 --> 12:26.944
first.
I couldn't care less.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.179
Great. Pranks.
We could...

12:29.314 --> 12:31.681
Brian?
Hey! (chuckles)

12:31.816 --> 12:34.020
Hey.
Oh, what are you doing out

12:34.154 --> 12:36.224
here, man?
If you must know, I'm talking

12:36.358 --> 12:38.392
to Ted's ghost.
I get that, man.

12:38.527 --> 12:40.394
I've been talking to a gremlin
for an hour in my room.

12:40.529 --> 12:43.631
All right, well, anyway, Ted
wanted me to pull a prank on

12:43.765 --> 12:45.765
everyone...
I'm in. You had me at prank.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.466
You don't even know what
we're gonna do.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.442
I don't care. I'm in.
I want to do it with you.

12:49.568 --> 12:51.435
Prank bros.
Okay, well, here's what I was

12:51.570 --> 12:53.370
thinking.
We get everyone together in a

12:53.504 --> 12:55.438
group for a picture here, and
then we get someone up here with

12:55.572 --> 12:57.372
a bucket...
Oh, I'll be the bucket guy.

12:57.507 --> 12:59.640
You sure?
Brian, look at me in my eyes.

12:59.774 --> 13:02.910
I will take care of this.
Fine. I'm gonna go to bed.

13:03.045 --> 13:05.075
All right. Let's go.
Great. No.

13:05.210 --> 13:07.079
Why?
Just be by yourself.

13:07.213 --> 13:08.746
Enjoy the scenery.
Okay, look.

13:08.881 --> 13:10.746
You know what? (groans)
I'm probably gonna put my dick

13:10.881 --> 13:12.382
in this beach.
All right, fine. Get crabs.

13:12.516 --> 13:14.819
(chuckles) Joke's on you.
I'm gonna give this beach crabs.

13:14.955 --> 13:19.325
Ooh, you sexy bitch.
?
?

13:25.536 --> 13:31.407
California Shiva Blast!
Shiva Komedi Somakanakram!

13:31.541 --> 13:37.746
(whooping)
This is the life.

13:37.880 --> 13:40.515
It looks just like her.

13:47.591 --> 13:52.359
I am gonna miss you. (kisses)
Look, I'm diligent, I'm

13:52.494 --> 13:54.894
detail-oriented, and I don't
think you will find someone with

13:54.930 --> 13:57.531
better bathroom etiquette.
How's your office small talk?

13:57.666 --> 13:59.865
Keep it under a minute.
No TV spoilers, no pictures of

13:59.999 --> 14:03.302
kids, we're done.
What do you think, Tom?

14:03.437 --> 14:05.804
I like him.
I like him, too.

14:05.939 --> 14:07.974
As a matter of fact, we could
use somebody with your corporate

14:08.109 --> 14:10.441
experience in our legal
department, and then we can

14:10.575 --> 14:12.541
segue you into the agent
business.

14:12.676 --> 14:14.941
Great. I'll just pick up and
start tomorrow, if you want.

14:15.075 --> 14:17.374
I will tell you this.
Our clients are our most

14:17.508 --> 14:19.609
important asset.
This isn't fantasy football.

14:19.743 --> 14:22.175
As a matter of fact, we don't
play fantasy football here.

14:22.309 --> 14:24.545
You don't play fantasy
football here?

14:24.679 --> 14:26.115
No, we don't play fantasy
football.

14:26.249 --> 14:27.683
Good. I don't play fantasy
football.

14:27.818 --> 14:30.053
I am a football purist.
You know, some people play in

14:30.188 --> 14:32.823
an eight-team league?
How sad is that?

14:32.956 --> 14:35.076
I mean, fantasy football's
pathetic, and an eight-team

14:35.091 --> 14:41.369
league, sad.
Sad.

14:41.503 --> 14:43.702
Guys!
Guys, oh, my God!

14:43.836 --> 14:46.203
Oh, my God!
I lost the Shiva!

14:46.338 --> 14:48.306
ALL: What?
We were having a beautiful

14:48.440 --> 14:52.313
afternoon on the beach, sitting,
enjoying the sun, and then this

14:52.447 --> 14:56.916
rogue wave just came and just
crashed over us, and it pulled

14:57.051 --> 15:01.055
us out, and I swam and I swam.
And then another wave came, and

15:01.189 --> 15:03.855
it knocked me down, and then I
lost her.

15:03.990 --> 15:09.194
She's just out to sea.
The sea has taken Shiva.

15:09.329 --> 15:11.397
Jesus.
I don't believe this.

15:11.531 --> 15:13.398
I'm on the verge of winning, and
you lose the Shiva.

15:13.533 --> 15:15.433
I'm sorry! It's terrible!
Babe, babe, listen.

15:15.568 --> 15:17.268
It's terrible!
It's okay, all right?

15:17.403 --> 15:19.271
I'll just go grab the Sacko,
throw it in the ocean, start...

15:19.406 --> 15:20.741
No, no!
No.

15:20.875 --> 15:22.576
Why?
Oh, God, what are we gonna

15:22.710 --> 15:25.013
do?
I guess the house is the new

15:25.147 --> 15:26.849
Shiva.
Oh.

15:26.984 --> 15:28.683
That's not bad, yeah.
Yeah, Shiva Komedi

15:28.818 --> 15:30.717
Somakana-casa.
And by the way, Kevin,

15:30.851 --> 15:32.853
I'm fine!
Oh, God! Oh!

15:32.989 --> 15:34.958
Oh, my God, is that alive?
It's seaweed.

15:35.093 --> 15:38.428
Is it alive, though?
You know, before we hire you,

15:38.563 --> 15:40.630
we want to see how you interact
with the clients.

15:40.765 --> 15:42.698
Great, I'm a real people person.

15:42.833 --> 15:45.031
Future first-ballot
Hall-of-Famer, Antonio Gates.

15:45.165 --> 15:47.200
How you doing?
Hey, nice to meet you.

15:47.334 --> 15:49.536
Haven't we met before?
Met before?

15:49.671 --> 15:52.640
You're an angry little man.
Yeah, I'm about to get angry

15:52.774 --> 15:54.108
all up in your face.
Yeah? Yeah?

15:54.243 --> 15:57.577
Yeah. Yeah!
Nope, not that I recall.

15:57.711 --> 16:00.311
You look familiar.
Yeah, I got one of those

16:00.446 --> 16:02.581
faces, but, um...
You're good.

16:02.715 --> 16:05.283
Take a seat there, buddy.
Tone, take it easy on him.

16:05.418 --> 16:07.451
We like this guy.
No problem.

16:07.585 --> 16:09.588
You gonna come back real soon?

16:09.722 --> 16:11.624
You said your name was Ruxin?
Well, everybody calls me

16:11.758 --> 16:13.724
Rodney.
Yeah, but we've met.

16:13.859 --> 16:15.791
Hey, big game this week, huh,
against the Niners?

16:15.924 --> 16:18.658
Big game, absolutely. Yeah.
Yeah, it's a big week, and

16:18.793 --> 16:22.966
yet, you know, you got to save
yourself for the playoffs.

16:23.100 --> 16:24.834
In this league, you can't do
that.

16:24.967 --> 16:27.234
You got to kind of play it every
week, every single week.

16:27.369 --> 16:29.237
'Cause you never know.
Maybe...

16:29.371 --> 16:31.739
Maybe let the wide receivers get
a TD or two.

16:31.874 --> 16:34.035
Like, throw Keenan Allen a bone.
I've marked this on my

16:34.107 --> 16:35.976
calendar.
I need to have a big week this

16:36.110 --> 16:38.011
week.
Maybe next week.

16:38.146 --> 16:40.313
No, I got to play big this week.

16:40.447 --> 16:42.349
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Enough about me.

16:42.484 --> 16:44.451
Tell me something about you.
You got a family?

16:44.586 --> 16:47.352
Yeah, I got a wife and kid.
Kid's not bad.

16:47.486 --> 16:49.686
He's actually a pretty solid
little athlete.

16:49.821 --> 16:51.588
Early developer, home run
hitter.

16:51.723 --> 16:53.790
Cute kid, cute kid.
He is a cute kid, yeah.

16:53.925 --> 16:55.860
It's really kind of bad
etiquette to go through

16:55.995 --> 16:57.696
someone's phone.
Oh, fantasy player, huh?

16:57.831 --> 16:59.865
What's that now?
Ruxin Roll.

16:59.999 --> 17:02.468
Get your Rux off.
Yeah, it's just pun stuff

17:02.602 --> 17:05.872
just to keep the mind nimble.
Hm.

17:06.006 --> 17:08.440
I remember you.
You're that angry little man

17:08.574 --> 17:10.609
that tried to throw a punch at
me.

17:10.743 --> 17:12.680
(gasps) That's how I know
you.

17:12.814 --> 17:14.681
You were mad at me because I
dropped a 40 burger on your

17:14.816 --> 17:16.782
team.
I'm a different guy now.

17:16.917 --> 17:19.152
I don't even play fantasy
football anymore, so.

17:19.286 --> 17:22.123
So I guess, you know, you
wouldn't mind if I started

17:22.257 --> 17:24.723
dropping a couple players, huh?
It wouldn't bother you.

17:24.858 --> 17:27.025
Hm-mmm.
Get rid of Drew Brees.

17:27.160 --> 17:29.395
Drew Brees.
Get rid of Dez Bryant.

17:29.529 --> 17:32.666
Yeah, 'cause he's not having
a big year at all.

17:32.801 --> 17:35.569
Yeah, Peyton Manning.
If you were saying you were

17:35.703 --> 17:37.637
gonna get rid of Papa John's, I
might stop you, but I don't

17:37.772 --> 17:39.474
care.
Chris Johnson.

17:39.608 --> 17:41.479
You can actually get rid of
Chris Johnson if you want.

17:41.613 --> 17:43.379
Get rid of Jamaal Charles, huh?

17:43.514 --> 17:45.434
Yeah, you don't need him.
Yeah, I don't need him.

17:45.445 --> 17:46.880
Okay.
Okay.

17:47.015 --> 17:48.983
Here we go.
No! No!

17:49.118 --> 17:51.253
Drew Brees, gone.
Not Drew!

17:51.387 --> 17:53.355
Tom Brady...
Please don't do this to me.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.024
Gone.
How can you hold me back with

17:55.159 --> 17:56.860
one arm?
How's everything going in

17:56.996 --> 17:58.564
here, guy...
Hey, what the hell is going

17:58.699 --> 18:00.569
on?
Guys, this is exactly what it

18:00.703 --> 18:03.639
looks like.
(sighs)

18:07.908 --> 18:10.874
Are you kidding me?
Come on, it is beautiful

18:11.009 --> 18:14.343
outside, and you guys are just
sitting here, glued to your

18:14.477 --> 18:16.127
computers.
Let's go to the beach.

18:16.232 --> 18:18.135
No, I'm good.
Leave us alone.

18:18.270 --> 18:20.403
(groans) God, you guys are
like couch mushrooms.

18:20.537 --> 18:22.739
Taco, you should probably hit
the beach with Jenny.

18:22.873 --> 18:24.976
No, I'm good, brother.
Got to set the best lineup

18:25.110 --> 18:28.446
possible, because I love you.
Okay, I'm gonna take Victor Cruz

18:28.580 --> 18:30.980
out, 'cause I just noticed he's
injured.

18:31.114 --> 18:33.115
Victor Cruz has been injured
since week six.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.117
Final poll.
I need a D.

18:35.252 --> 18:37.654
Miami or the Titans v.
Jacksonville?

18:37.789 --> 18:39.324
Miami.
Ooh, good one.

18:39.458 --> 18:40.626
Titans.
Good, good, good.

18:40.760 --> 18:42.361
Titans for sure.
I don't take advice from

18:42.397 --> 18:44.499
Sackos.
Ooh, hey, Rafi, got to pick a D.

18:44.633 --> 18:46.100
Trying to think, Miami or
Titans?

18:46.234 --> 18:47.867
D? What, like a dick?
Forget this.

18:48.001 --> 18:49.669
Which is the biggest dick?
Don't worry about it.

18:49.803 --> 18:51.723
I'm gonna pick Miami. Miami.
Thank you very much.

18:51.806 --> 18:53.642
Well, I can't believe this,
but the games are about to

18:53.777 --> 18:55.477
start.
I love this West Coast thing.

18:55.611 --> 18:57.145
I know, life begins
at 10:00 a.m.

18:57.279 --> 18:59.447
All right, the Shiva Bowl
Championship lineup has been

18:59.582 --> 19:01.449
set.
Time for a beer to celebrate.

19:01.584 --> 19:04.784
Uh, you realize your winning
lineup has yet to be saved?

19:04.919 --> 19:07.189
What's that?
Well, you tinkered, you

19:07.324 --> 19:09.204
stinkered, but you forgot to
press "set lineup."

19:09.327 --> 19:10.895
Oh, very funny.
Oh, no joke.

19:11.029 --> 19:12.797
They're kicking off.
What?! No!

19:12.932 --> 19:16.399
(laughter)
Kickoff.

19:16.533 --> 19:18.634
I pressed it, I pressed it, I
pressed it.

19:18.769 --> 19:20.870
No, I pressed "set lineup."
No, I don't see it submitted,

19:21.005 --> 19:22.875
Ruxin.
You pressed it too late.

19:23.009 --> 19:25.044
Lineups lock when the kickoff
happens. Sorry.

19:25.179 --> 19:26.678
Commissioner, I set my lineup.

19:26.813 --> 19:28.311
You saw me set my lineup.
Ruxin, you know how this

19:28.445 --> 19:29.845
works.
Yeah, I know exactly how this

19:29.977 --> 19:31.512
works.
All you parasites collude

19:31.646 --> 19:34.081
against me, and then just when
it matters most, you screw me.

19:34.215 --> 19:36.247
Your finger colluded against
you.

19:36.382 --> 19:38.352
No, your outfit colluded
against you.

19:38.487 --> 19:40.486
You look like a European porn
extra.

19:40.621 --> 19:42.892
Hey, babe, did you see these
super cute pictures your mom

19:43.026 --> 19:44.895
sent of the kids?
They are so cute.

19:45.030 --> 19:46.830
Oh, my God, I'd love to see
the kids.

19:46.963 --> 19:49.096
Cutie, cutie, so cute.
No, that's not my...

19:49.231 --> 19:51.332
Oh, what's this?
The e-mail from Andre to the

19:51.466 --> 19:53.365
group about splitting up the
house.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.566
You joking me?
This is collusion!

19:55.700 --> 19:57.933
(shouting)
We talk about what we want to

19:58.068 --> 19:59.933
talk about.
We split the house.

20:00.068 --> 20:01.869
That doesn't mean we're
colluding against you.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
So, the, uh, Shiva Bowl is
underway?

20:04.134 --> 20:05.734
Yeah, the Shiva Bowl's
underway, because they're

20:05.867 --> 20:07.533
colluding against me, which
means we've officially begun.

20:07.668 --> 20:09.500
You can't take someone's
phone and go through their

20:09.635 --> 20:11.204
pictures.
You can't take anything.

20:11.338 --> 20:15.278
(shouting)
Everybody, please, quiet!

20:15.413 --> 20:18.180
...Potato chip.
This is exactly as Mr.

20:18.314 --> 20:20.412
Rappaport predicted.
You people cannot stop acting

20:20.547 --> 20:22.847
like animals, so I am prepared
for this.

20:22.982 --> 20:25.516
I am bringing in the perfect
person to make a ruling.

20:25.651 --> 20:28.050
Everyone, I would like you to
meet Mike Pereira, former head

20:28.185 --> 20:31.222
of NFL Officiating.
Yeah, we know who he is.

20:31.357 --> 20:33.622
We watch him on TV every week.
What are you doing here?

20:33.757 --> 20:36.425
Ted-Ted was a good man.
I'm just here to help him with

20:36.559 --> 20:38.526
his final wishes.
I don't know how to tell you

20:38.661 --> 20:41.626
this, but Ted died.
Okay, well, I have, uh,

20:41.760 --> 20:43.860
filled Mike in on everything
that's transpired thus far this

20:43.995 --> 20:45.863
morning.
Well, I can tell you right

20:45.997 --> 20:47.895
now that I pressed the submit
button.

20:48.030 --> 20:50.264
My finger crossed the plane.
Okay, well, let's go under

20:50.398 --> 20:52.365
the hood and review it.
It's a kitchen hood.

20:52.500 --> 20:55.035
Hey, respect the stripes.
I'm trying to respect the

20:55.170 --> 20:58.704
stripe on your stupid hat.
Hey, I see a finger smudge

20:58.838 --> 21:00.738
here.
That's the one.

21:00.873 --> 21:02.393
That's my print.
That's my fingerprint.

21:02.507 --> 21:06.542
I got to mark it.
Got to get my chains out.

21:13.783 --> 21:17.946
After reviewing the play, Ruxin
failed to reach the submit

21:18.081 --> 21:21.483
lineup button when the finger
was down.

21:21.617 --> 21:24.549
You lose your challenge.
Send it to New York.

21:24.683 --> 21:26.651
I am New York.
We're not gonna send anywhere.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.786
What are you, crazy?
You know what, I'm throwing

21:28.919 --> 21:31.152
my red challenge flag, because
these people have been colluding

21:31.286 --> 21:33.155
against me.
I went on her phone, and I saw

21:33.289 --> 21:35.828
proof they were gonna split this
house amongst themselves.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.730
You want to know how he saw
that?

21:37.864 --> 21:40.224
He grabbed my phone and went
through all the pictures like a

21:40.235 --> 21:43.273
grubby raccoon.
You went through her phone?

21:43.408 --> 21:45.276
It doesn't matter how I got
the information.

21:45.410 --> 21:47.412
I got the information that they
were colluding. Red flag.

21:47.546 --> 21:49.515
It does matter.
The rules of society, my friend.

21:49.650 --> 21:52.820
If you are looking at a phone
and somebody gives it to you to

21:52.955 --> 21:55.257
look at a photo, you look at
that photo only.

21:55.391 --> 21:57.324
You don't scroll up and down.
You don't look at other e-mails.

21:57.459 --> 22:00.328
You don't open other apps.
You know what that's called?

22:00.463 --> 22:03.135
Illegal scrolling.
Yeah, illegal scrolling.

22:03.270 --> 22:05.171
I like that.
Scrolling.

22:05.305 --> 22:07.639
We're picking up the flag for
collusion and you, my friend,

22:07.773 --> 22:09.945
lose your second challenge.
Yes!

22:10.079 --> 22:12.652
I want to bring back the
replacement refs!

22:12.772 --> 22:14.883
Oh, sure, everybody says that.

22:16.260 --> 22:19.224
Well, congratulations, Andre.
You're a Shiva Bowl Champion.

22:19.344 --> 22:22.179
(cheering)
You can just sign here, and then

22:22.314 --> 22:25.618
the house will be yours.
That's right.

22:25.752 --> 22:28.456
Okay, thank you so much.
You, uh, you all disgust me.

22:28.590 --> 22:33.400
And you perhaps most of all.
You do not deserve this.

22:33.535 --> 22:37.307
Congratulations.
(laughs)

22:37.441 --> 22:39.941
Shiva Bowl Champ!
I won! I won!

22:40.076 --> 22:43.315
No, we won.
Now let's talk some months,

22:43.451 --> 22:45.318
buddy.
(groans)

22:45.452 --> 22:47.053
You all lost.
You're all losers.

22:47.187 --> 22:49.388
A pax on all of your homes.
I think you mean pox, Ruxin.

22:49.522 --> 22:51.722
No, I mean that the only
cable network you all

22:51.856 --> 22:54.389
should get is PAX.
I don't get it.

22:54.522 --> 22:56.803
This is not the lineup I set.
Oh, Taco, lose with a little

22:56.923 --> 22:58.893
dignity.
Stop whining.

22:59.027 --> 23:00.895
No, I'm telling you,
it's different.

23:01.029 --> 23:02.949
It's not the lineup I set.
I wonder what could've

23:03.063 --> 23:04.764
happened.
I wonder what could've

23:04.899 --> 23:06.600
happened.
Thank you! Thank you!

23:06.735 --> 23:09.102
Thank you!
Thank you, Shiva!

23:09.236 --> 23:11.506
Oh, well.
A win's a win, I guess.

23:11.641 --> 23:13.843
Yes, it is.
A win is a win.

23:13.978 --> 23:16.177
You earned it.
I know, I did.

23:16.312 --> 23:18.447
Yeah.
I'm proud of you, brother.

23:18.581 --> 23:20.149
Thank you.
Come on.

23:20.284 --> 23:22.018
Well, not proud, just less
embarrassed.

23:22.153 --> 23:23.984
No, no.
That's interesting.

23:24.119 --> 23:25.953
Come on.
No. Family functions only.

23:26.088 --> 23:28.624
Okay, sorry.
Stop it.

23:28.758 --> 23:30.627
This is not a family function.
Sit down.

23:30.761 --> 23:32.863
Hey, don't you have something
to do?

23:32.997 --> 23:35.498
Yes.
Uh, all right, I would like to

23:35.632 --> 23:37.797
do a league photo on the lower
balcony, so just get everyone

23:37.932 --> 23:39.867
together.
Meet me over there, okay?

23:40.002 --> 23:42.369
Guys, I have a quick
announcement to make.

23:42.503 --> 23:45.471
I was just talking to Mike
Pereira, and I think I'm gonna

23:45.605 --> 23:47.608
become a ref.
What?

23:47.742 --> 23:49.676
Think about it.
Look, I love to be in a position

23:49.810 --> 23:52.478
of power arbitrarily, I love
having people listen to me and

23:52.612 --> 23:55.146
do what I say even if I happen
to be wrong, and I'll never have

23:55.281 --> 23:57.980
to say I'm sorry again.
It's kind of like my calling.

23:58.114 --> 23:59.982
And the stripes are pretty
slimming, too.

24:00.117 --> 24:01.784
I don't really care about that.

24:01.918 --> 24:03.351
You should.
Thank you, Jenny.

24:03.486 --> 24:05.488
Well, on that note, please
come with me down to the beach.

24:05.623 --> 24:08.824
Oh, boy.
Might need some of that.

24:08.959 --> 24:11.661
Rafi, hey, come on!
It's time for the prank.

24:11.795 --> 24:16.232
Rafi?
(grunting)

24:16.367 --> 24:18.668
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Huh?

24:18.802 --> 24:20.802
Wait, what's all this?
Allow me to introduce you to

24:20.839 --> 24:22.876
my two favorite pranksters,
gasoline and kerosene.

24:23.011 --> 24:25.145
No! Why do you have all this
stuff?

24:25.279 --> 24:26.879
For the prank.
I told you I'd take care of it.

24:27.013 --> 24:28.747
You're gonna light them on
fire?!

24:28.882 --> 24:30.684
It's a prank!
No, I want you to take water

24:30.819 --> 24:32.854
and pour it onto their heads.
Brian, water puts out fire.

24:32.988 --> 24:35.887
How do you not know this?
Oh, my God, you are adorable.

24:36.021 --> 24:38.592
(chuckles)
I don't think you know how

24:38.727 --> 24:40.693
pranks work.
The year of the Dre begins

24:40.828 --> 24:42.996
now.
We'll put aside our petty

24:43.130 --> 24:46.235
disagreements, and, in the words
of Taylor Swift, we will just

24:46.369 --> 24:49.436
shake it off.
(booing)

24:49.571 --> 24:52.372
Okay, in the spirit of good
sportsmanship, I present a

24:52.506 --> 24:57.842
message to you, my fellow
league-mates.

24:57.977 --> 25:01.045
Enjoy!
(chuckles)

25:01.179 --> 25:03.348
Ooh!
Wow, that's pretty cool.

25:03.482 --> 25:06.249
(laughter, cheering)
Hey!

25:06.383 --> 25:08.182
Suck it?
(groaning)

25:08.317 --> 25:09.750
Come on!
You stole my saying.

25:09.885 --> 25:11.754
I co-opted it.
In the year of the Dre, I say

25:11.888 --> 25:13.957
suck it.
What are we supposed to suck,

25:14.091 --> 25:15.790
Andre?
The butthole.

25:15.924 --> 25:17.426
We're supposed to suck your
butthole?

25:17.560 --> 25:19.596
No, everyone's butthole.
We have to suck everyone's

25:19.730 --> 25:21.195
butthole?
It's my butthole.

25:21.330 --> 25:23.930
Fine, suck my butthole.
So you made some fireworks so

25:24.065 --> 25:26.134
that we could all suck your
butthole?

25:26.269 --> 25:28.133
Yes, it's a punishment.
When you've been bad, you have

25:28.268 --> 25:29.799
to suck the butthole.
So when everybody's saying

25:29.934 --> 25:31.602
"suck it," you think we're
talking about buttholes, just to

25:31.737 --> 25:33.038
be clear?
What else would you be

25:33.172 --> 25:34.537
talking about?
What about dicks?

25:34.672 --> 25:36.775
Why would you even do that?
Ew, ew, ew.

25:36.909 --> 25:39.214
Have you ever gotten a blow job?

25:39.348 --> 25:42.382
Yeah, I've had a blow job.
You've had one?

25:42.517 --> 25:44.486
Andre.
What, I've had plenty of...

25:44.620 --> 25:47.424
You're lying, first of all,
but you've had your butthole

25:47.559 --> 25:49.557
sucked on?
Yeah, it's second base.

25:49.691 --> 25:51.591
You think that's what second
base is?

25:51.725 --> 25:54.759
What? It's not?
I do not want you to light

25:54.893 --> 25:57.174
our friends and family on fire!
Brian, this is what taking

25:57.262 --> 25:59.129
care of it is.
No, I don't want you to

25:59.263 --> 26:00.898
handle this prank.
You are now out of this prank

26:01.032 --> 26:02.899
game.
Brian, just smell this.

26:03.034 --> 26:04.936
No! Put that down!
It's hilarious.

26:05.070 --> 26:06.904
That is the opposite of
what I want you to do.

26:07.039 --> 26:08.672
Brian, why are you ruining
this prank?

26:08.807 --> 26:10.307
How does this thing play out
in your mind, okay?

26:10.440 --> 26:12.406
You pour gasoline on our
friends, and then what?

26:12.540 --> 26:14.407
We light them on fire!
And they're like, "Oh, my God!

26:14.541 --> 26:16.842
Rafi and Brian pranked us!"
(laughs)

26:16.977 --> 26:19.144
No, they won't be laughing,
because they'll be on fire!

26:19.278 --> 26:21.578
Of course they're gonna be on
fire, and yes, they're gonna

26:21.712 --> 26:24.780
die, but then we're gonna bury
their remains under this house

26:24.915 --> 26:27.783
where we will live for the rest
of our days as best friends!

26:27.917 --> 26:31.152
Hilarious prank!
What?

26:31.287 --> 26:33.587
Oh, shit.
(chuckles) Oh, boy.

26:33.721 --> 26:35.822
Reverse prank.
I'm out of here!

26:35.957 --> 26:39.126
I don't need you guys, okay?
You know what, this is the year

26:39.261 --> 26:42.794
of the Dre!
Andre, look behind you!

26:42.929 --> 26:44.965
I'm not gonna look behind me.
I'm gonna look ahead, to the

26:45.100 --> 26:46.868
future!
Andre, you're on fire.

26:47.002 --> 26:49.673
I am on fire with winning.
I'm unstoppable now!

26:49.807 --> 26:52.479
We made a mistake!
Get back!

26:52.614 --> 26:54.816
Awesome prank!
Oh, God!

26:54.950 --> 26:57.117
Watch this!
It's gonna be hilarious!

26:57.252 --> 26:59.451
(screaming)
Yes!

26:59.586 --> 27:03.490
Pranked! Pranked!
Yeah!

27:03.624 --> 27:05.626
Whoa!
Shiva!

27:05.760 --> 27:07.729
Hey, I thought she was washed
out to sea.

27:07.863 --> 27:09.732
Oops.
My beach house.

27:09.867 --> 27:13.035
You stupid assholes.
No way, dead guy.

27:13.169 --> 27:17.240
Best prank ever!
Rafi, what did you do?

27:17.374 --> 27:19.336
That was Brian's idea.
I just helped.

27:19.456 --> 27:21.044
Brian?!
