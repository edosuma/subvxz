22:58.127 --> 22:59.420
She's a right beaut.

23:00.004 --> 23:00.838
Excuse me?

23:00.921 --> 23:02.548
Yeah. Sweet as, I mean.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.925
I can help you restore her
to her original glory.

23:05.509 --> 23:09.138
Thank you, but I have zero intention
of restoring this relic.

23:10.264 --> 23:11.599
Uh, it's not a relic.

23:12.641 --> 23:13.559
Yes, it is.

23:13.642 --> 23:16.812
And I'm replacing it
with a contemporary functioning faucet.

23:17.271 --> 23:18.105
May I?

23:18.564 --> 23:21.775
-So, this is hand-finished brass.
-Great.

23:21.859 --> 23:24.361
-They don't make 'em like that anymore.
-[Gabriela] Mm-hmm.

23:24.820 --> 23:26.697
Just a new washer
and she's right as.

23:26.780 --> 23:28.073
Why are you everywhere that I am?

23:29.325 --> 23:31.243
Well, Beechwood Downs is a small town.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.078
Maybe you're everywhere I am.

23:35.039 --> 23:35.998
Oops.

23:36.457 --> 23:38.959
-Clean-up, aisle three.
-It's all right, Jo. I've got it.

23:39.043 --> 23:40.753
-Thanks. Sorry.
-Thank you.

23:42.046 --> 23:44.548
-[Gabriela groans]
-You gotta go easy on these old drawers.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.508
I know how to open a drawer... usually.

23:46.592 --> 23:48.636
-I only meant--
-What, that you know better than I do?

23:48.719 --> 23:50.262
Whoa, relax. Just cool your jets.

23:50.596 --> 23:51.430
[scoffs]

23:51.847 --> 23:53.599
Okay. Let me tell you something, buddy.

23:54.350 --> 23:57.603
After losing both my boyfriend and my job
in the span of a week,

23:57.686 --> 24:01.231
I travel across the world to find out
that I'm the new owner of a money pit.

24:01.315 --> 24:02.858
-Okay.
-I'm already at the end

24:02.942 --> 24:04.610
of a really short rope,

24:04.693 --> 24:08.030
so I will cool my jets
when and where I choose. Okay?

24:08.113 --> 24:09.073
Uh-huh.

24:09.156 --> 24:10.074
Yep. Yeah, got it.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.618
[clears throat]
You relax on your own schedule.

24:14.620 --> 24:15.454
I will.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.920
Hey, cool your jets.

24:27.883 --> 24:30.052
[man] No. No, she did not.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.261
Well, wait for this.

24:31.345 --> 24:34.556
Annabelle caused a hell of a ruckus
at last month's book club.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.101
She brought along a raspberry jelly whip,

24:37.184 --> 24:39.895
and as you might guess,
that sent Sheila off.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.940
She picks up her jelly whip
and storms off. Oh.

25:01.959 --> 25:04.420
Just don't call me late for dinner.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.130

25:06.213 --> 25:08.382

25:08.465 --> 25:10.134

25:10.217 --> 25:12.219

starts with a plumbing disaster.

25:12.302 --> 25:13.637
-Ha!
-Ooh.

25:13.721 --> 25:14.972
Can you add this in?

25:16.140 --> 25:18.851
It seems like this inn is
more of a challenge than I expected.

25:18.934 --> 25:21.729
Um, do you know anybody in town
that does renovations?

25:21.812 --> 25:23.564
Ah, well, as a matter of fact,

25:23.647 --> 25:26.692
the best contractor on the North Island
lives right here in town.

25:26.775 --> 25:27.818
Name's Jake Taylor.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.945
I love it. Can I have his phone number?

25:30.029 --> 25:31.530
Hey, Jake. What's your phone number?

25:31.613 --> 25:33.323
-Who's asking?
-She is.

25:33.407 --> 25:34.575
No, I didn't.

25:34.658 --> 25:36.201
You just asked me for his phone number.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.871
-Actually I did, but I--
-Why do you want my number?

25:39.163 --> 25:41.498
-I don't.
-She's the new owner of Bellbird,

25:41.582 --> 25:43.083
and she wants your number.

25:43.167 --> 25:46.795
You know what? On second thought,
I don't need a contractor, but thank you.

25:47.087 --> 25:48.589
Keep the change. Bye.

25:50.758 --> 25:52.009
What a strange girl.

25:52.342 --> 25:53.469

Oh, Hana.

26:42.518 --> 26:43.811
These are amazing.

26:44.228 --> 26:49.316
Bellbird Valley Farm
was quite the prize showcase in her day.

26:49.399 --> 26:53.904
Nobody ran an inn
quite like old Mabel Browning.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.449
Until the tragedy, that is.

-[Hana] Oh.

27:06.917 --> 27:07.751
Thank you, Hana.

27:11.421 --> 27:14.216

27:33.819 --> 27:35.404
[Gabriela] I've been brainstorming.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.489
Maybe, just maybe,

27:37.573 --> 27:39.533
Bellbird Valley Farm is my chance

27:39.616 --> 27:42.703
to make the zero-net energy green home
I've always dreamed of!

27:42.786 --> 27:43.620
Yes!

-[Gabriela] Thank you, Alan.
-Excuse me?

27:47.040 --> 27:49.126

-Yes!

27:52.963 --> 27:54.423
-And yes!
-Yes!

27:54.506 --> 27:56.091
I'm gonna max out all my credit cards.

27:56.175 --> 27:59.469

what Gabriela Diaz

27:59.553 --> 28:01.847

28:01.930 --> 28:02.931

-[Gabriela] And a good day to you, sir!

28:06.226 --> 28:07.519
-Okay.
-[Gabriela] Ah...

28:10.522 --> 28:11.565
I forgot my stuff.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.443
Okay, Norm.

28:14.526 --> 28:18.280
All right. So, I need
a few rolls of hemp insulation,

28:19.156 --> 28:23.160
and one case of, uh,
sustainable bamboo floor tiles.

28:23.243 --> 28:24.494
[Norm exhales]

28:24.578 --> 28:27.164
This'll have to be shipped
from Australia.

28:27.789 --> 28:28.707
It won't be cheap.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.627
I'll give you a 90-day tab.

28:33.212 --> 28:34.171
Ninety days?

28:35.464 --> 28:36.298
Why?

28:37.007 --> 28:38.842
That's how we do things around here.

28:39.259 --> 28:40.093
Plus,

28:40.594 --> 28:41.803
you gave me a nickname.

28:42.387 --> 28:43.222
Norm.

28:43.764 --> 28:46.266
I've never had a nickname before.
Always wanted one.

28:46.725 --> 28:50.062
Well, 90 days sounds
incredibly impractical,

28:50.479 --> 28:53.065
but also very much appreciated, Norm.

28:53.148 --> 28:55.359
You'll pay me
once Bellbird's up and running.

28:56.193 --> 28:57.027
Frankly,

28:57.611 --> 29:00.072
I'm curious to see how it all turns out.

29:00.155 --> 29:01.907
Eh, yeah. Me too.

29:02.491 --> 29:05.744
You fellas call me Norm from now on. Norm.

29:06.286 --> 29:07.287

29:07.829 --> 29:10.415
Well, my plan was to be here
for a week tops, but...

29:10.499 --> 29:14.253

that we're friends?

29:23.220 --> 29:26.223
And we can talk more about it

I'll stay in mine. Deal?

-Thank you.

out to New Zealand by yourself?

Of course, no, I am sure
you're a very strong, independent woman.

30:41.465 --> 30:44.426
It's just, it gets really lonely out here
in the countryside.

Hey, Norm. Here's another item to add
to the list of things I need to pay for

Not technically, no, but I do like
to help out Norman when I can.

If that's for the Bellbird kitchen sink,

33:26.755 --> 33:28.715
you might have better luck
with a 5/8 flare wrench.

33:29.090 --> 33:30.800

-Won't go there without a flare.

35:39.971 --> 35:40.972
You must miss him.

Sometimes.

35:43.224 --> 35:45.685
So, tell me how the renovations
are coming along.

Oh, well, it's been a bumpy road.

35:48.229 --> 35:49.397

of an eco-friendly solar-powered inn.

35:56.029 --> 35:57.280

35:57.947 --> 36:01.368
In my experience, B&B guests
come to get away from modernity.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.620
They want a true old-fashioned escape.

-I'll cut to the chase.

36:20.178 --> 36:23.181
And then he realized
he could clean up with this...

36:23.848 --> 36:26.267
"Win an Inn" scam,

36:26.351 --> 36:28.561
and he robbed me of my dream.

36:31.690 --> 36:32.524
Oh.

36:32.899 --> 36:34.901
Now that you've experienced

36:34.984 --> 36:39.572
the extensive and expensive work
that the inn needs,

36:52.335 --> 36:55.588
and go back to America and your real life.

Can I think about it?

[Mr. Pat snores]

36:59.050 --> 36:59.884

they're irreplaceable,

Uh-huh. So, how's the old Bellbird?

37:57.692 --> 38:00.528
Okay, what did you guys even gossip about
before I got here?

38:00.612 --> 38:02.572
You know what?
I reckon we'd run out of topics.

38:02.989 --> 38:05.658
Yeah, your arrival really
livened things up in that department.

38:05.742 --> 38:08.286
I'm glad to be of service
to the community.

38:08.995 --> 38:10.830

All right, I'll see you around.

Thank you.

most eligible bachelor
might be keen on you.

38:26.554 --> 38:28.139
[scoffs] Yeah. Doubtful.

38:28.431 --> 38:31.100
Every time I see him,
I am a complete disaster.

38:31.184 --> 38:32.560
That's why I'm trying to avoid him.

38:33.269 --> 38:35.396
I've known Jake Taylor my whole life.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.523
He is lovely.

38:36.606 --> 38:39.400
If he's so desirable,
then why is he still single, hm?

38:39.484 --> 38:40.693
How come you're not dating him?

38:40.777 --> 38:41.653
[laughs]

38:42.570 --> 38:45.949
No, look. I mean, I had a crush on him
when we were younger, we all did,

38:46.032 --> 38:49.160
but, uh, Jake had a...
a long-time girlfriend.

38:49.661 --> 38:50.870
High school sweethearts.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.165

38:55.166 --> 38:56.417
Oh, wow, that's awful.

38:56.960 --> 38:59.128
He hasn't taken a chance on love
since then.

39:00.547 --> 39:02.882
This little flirt
over the fertilizer, though,

39:02.966 --> 39:04.634
says that could all be changing.

39:04.717 --> 39:06.553

-Sorry.

What? Corey?

39:29.576 --> 39:30.577
[scoffs] No.

39:30.660 --> 39:33.872
No, no, no. He just really loves plants.
That's the only reason he comes in here

39:33.955 --> 39:37.792
all the time when he...
doesn't really have a section of land.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.252
[Gabriela] Yeah. Mm-hmm.

I say take the lead, girl.

That means "your food is good," right?

42:08.693 --> 42:10.361
You just called my mother a prostitute.

42:10.778 --> 42:12.864
-What? Oh, no, I didn't--
-[both] Kidding!

42:13.322 --> 42:14.157
[imitates explosion]

42:14.240 --> 42:16.242
[Jake]
You're still sticking with that one?

42:16.325 --> 42:17.744
-Yes.
-The two of you.

42:18.202 --> 42:19.871
-[sneezes]
-[all] Bless you.

42:19.954 --> 42:22.248
-Are you coming down with something?
-No. I'm good.

42:22.331 --> 42:24.584
-Mmm. What is that?
-It's all good. I've got it.

42:25.001 --> 42:26.002
You can get it next time.

42:26.794 --> 42:28.755
What makes you think
there's gonna be a next time?

42:28.838 --> 42:30.757
You keep following me all around town.

42:31.758 --> 42:33.843
[giggles] You keep telling yourself that.

42:34.343 --> 42:35.178
But thank you.

42:35.511 --> 42:36.345
You're welcome.

42:37.055 --> 42:37.930
Ladies first.

42:39.557 --> 42:42.143
What about you?
Beechwood Downs your whole life?

42:42.643 --> 42:43.895
Oh, I did an OE.

42:43.978 --> 42:45.104
An overseas experience.

42:45.188 --> 42:46.564
I lived in London for a year,

42:46.647 --> 42:49.108
and then spent a few years
at uni in Australia.

42:50.276 --> 42:54.572
Ah, there's more to this provincial chippy
than the lady suspected, huh?

42:54.655 --> 42:58.367
Ah, no, I was... You know what?
I'm gonna stop before I step in it.

42:58.451 --> 43:00.036
But I missed the country.

43:00.119 --> 43:02.080
Fresh air, open spaces.

43:02.163 --> 43:03.790
-Listen, I was-- [sneezes]
-Oh.

43:03.873 --> 43:05.208
-Bless you.
-Mmm.

43:05.792 --> 43:07.085
You sure you're not getting sick?

43:07.168 --> 43:08.002
No.

43:08.086 --> 43:10.213
I'm fine. I never get sick.

43:10.296 --> 43:11.130
[sneezes]

43:11.672 --> 43:13.174
Can't believe I'm sick.

43:13.257 --> 43:14.383
[coughs]

43:14.467 --> 43:15.551
[sniffles]

43:15.968 --> 43:16.969

43:19.889 --> 43:20.723
[groans]

43:20.807 --> 43:22.433
-[knocking]
-It's open.

43:24.435 --> 43:27.230
[sighs] I brought Dr. Corey
on a house call.

43:27.563 --> 43:28.981
-Ding-dong.
-[chuckles]

43:29.065 --> 43:30.691
Well, how'd you guys
even know I was sick?

43:30.775 --> 43:33.152
Peter and Manaaki told me
you were coming down with something,

43:33.236 --> 43:35.655
and then when you were a no-show
at the farmer's market, I...

43:35.738 --> 43:38.366
Why do you not have a hot cup of tea
in your hand,

43:38.449 --> 43:40.034
and why is that not on the stove?

43:40.118 --> 43:42.912
Well, it turns out
I can't fix a simple kitchen sink.

43:43.955 --> 43:45.915
-I was about to fill it in the tub.
-Okay.

43:45.998 --> 43:47.291
I'm here to fix this.

43:47.375 --> 43:48.960
-[Gabriela] Mmm.
-[chuckles]

43:49.669 --> 43:52.338
And give me a nice big "aah."

43:52.421 --> 43:53.256
Aah.

43:53.339 --> 43:55.007
Ah, just as I suspected.

43:55.091 --> 43:56.676
Ah, what do you suspect?

43:56.759 --> 43:58.344
The common cold.

43:58.427 --> 44:00.054
Your immune system is run down.

44:00.471 --> 44:02.682
Bed-rest and fluids
are the only cure, I'm afraid.

44:02.765 --> 44:03.766
[Gabriela] Mmm.

44:03.850 --> 44:05.184
-<i>Kia ora.</i>
-Manaaki.

44:05.268 --> 44:06.227
Oh, love.

44:06.310 --> 44:08.146
-Is it a cold?
-Yeah, afraid so.

44:08.229 --> 44:09.063
Drink this.

44:09.397 --> 44:10.648
[sighs] Okay.

44:11.315 --> 44:12.692
[slurps] Mmm.

44:13.484 --> 44:14.735
Mmm! Mmm.

44:15.319 --> 44:16.821
Oh, this... Wow.

44:16.904 --> 44:19.407
Yeah, I called in a prescription
for Peter's kūmara curry soup.

44:19.490 --> 44:21.993
-Spice is the trick to knock out the cold.
-Yeah, a little spicy.

44:22.076 --> 44:23.035
-More.
-Yeah.

44:23.119 --> 44:24.203
[Jake] G'day!

44:24.287 --> 44:25.163
Mm, Jake.

44:25.496 --> 44:27.206
Did you guys come in a clown car?

44:27.290 --> 44:29.167
Kitchen sink's still munted, eh?

44:29.917 --> 44:31.294
Who ever could have told you that?

44:31.377 --> 44:33.588
And a little something for your tea.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.840
Helps with a sore throat. From my bees.

44:36.674 --> 44:37.758
-Your bees?
-Bees.

44:37.842 --> 44:39.218
-Like buzzing bees?
-Uh, yeah, bees.

44:39.302 --> 44:41.053
I'm gonna have a squiz
at your kitchen sink.

44:41.137 --> 44:42.096
Fever dream.

44:43.139 --> 44:44.223
Oh, Jake, wait.

44:45.224 --> 44:46.309
[sighs] You guys...

44:48.144 --> 44:49.604
I'm running low on cash.

44:49.687 --> 44:51.397
Gabriela, love, no.

44:51.480 --> 44:53.232
Yeah, I'm not here on a job. It's okay.

44:53.316 --> 44:55.443
We're here because we're your mates.

44:55.526 --> 44:57.695
As long as you're here, you’re <i>whānau.</i>

44:58.571 --> 44:59.614
One of us.

44:59.697 --> 45:01.657
And we look after our own.

45:01.741 --> 45:02.658
Here.

45:02.742 --> 45:05.119
Now, off to bed, young lady.

45:06.329 --> 45:07.163
Come on.

45:07.788 --> 45:09.582
He's so cute when he talks sternly.

46:19.735 --> 46:21.654

46:28.119 --> 46:29.328
[Gabriela] That was so good.

46:33.082 --> 46:34.667
-I said it right, right?
-Yeah, you did.

46:34.750 --> 46:35.584
Okay, good.

46:36.210 --> 46:37.670
-They're so cute.
-Thank you.

46:37.753 --> 46:40.339
Oh, Gabriela!
Did you care to buy a raffle ticket?

46:40.423 --> 46:41.632
Oh, uh, let me see.

46:41.716 --> 46:43.592
Oh, do you have change for a twenty?

46:43.676 --> 46:45.344
No, I don't,

46:45.428 --> 46:48.431
but it's for a worthy cause,
so there you go.

46:48.514 --> 46:50.725
-Okay, thanks.
-Anytime. Hey...

46:51.267 --> 46:53.102
have you given any thought to my offer?

46:53.185 --> 46:56.105
I spoke to my husband,
and we could wire some money through.

46:56.188 --> 46:57.273
Charlotte, I'm...

46:58.065 --> 46:59.233
I'm gonna turn it down.

46:59.317 --> 47:00.151
Come again?

47:00.234 --> 47:02.361
I'm just not willing
to give up on my dream.

47:02.445 --> 47:03.487
At least not yet.

47:04.322 --> 47:06.282
Can we still be friends?

47:06.365 --> 47:08.034
Don't give it a moment's thought.

47:09.118 --> 47:10.286
Oh! Sorry.

47:11.495 --> 47:12.621
Is that a yes?

47:12.955 --> 47:14.415
[Jake] Let's go. Oh!

47:14.498 --> 47:17.793
Come on, Tim! I've coached you
for five seasons, man.

47:17.877 --> 47:20.546
What do they teach you
in that fancy university, huh?

47:21.172 --> 47:23.466
Well, well, well,
if it isn't the American.

47:23.549 --> 47:24.675
You care to test your skills?

47:25.384 --> 47:28.971
Just wanted to say thank you for helping
fix my sink and my window, Jake.

47:29.055 --> 47:31.265
Around here, I go by Chief Taylor.

47:31.349 --> 47:32.391
You're a fireman?

47:32.475 --> 47:34.643
A volunteer firefighter. Yeah, we all are.

47:34.727 --> 47:36.354
Okay, Chief Taylor.

47:36.437 --> 47:38.898
Um, I was hoping to talk to you
about a proposition?

47:38.981 --> 47:40.107
[Jake] A proposition?

47:40.191 --> 47:42.443
As you can see,
I'm a little preoccupied at the moment,

47:42.526 --> 47:45.321
but if you care to make a donation,
I might be able to give you a minute.

47:45.654 --> 47:48.783
If not, I might schedule you in next week.
Maybe.

47:48.866 --> 47:51.452
Next week?
You're looking for trouble, aren't you?

47:51.535 --> 47:52.370
Trouble from who?

47:52.453 --> 47:54.372
A girl who can't work a clutch
to save her--

47:54.455 --> 47:55.539
[screams]

47:55.623 --> 47:58.209
-[man 1] Whoa!
-[man 2] Oh, my God.

47:58.292 --> 48:00.795
-[Jake] Oh. That was pretty good.
-[man 3] Nice shot.

48:01.545 --> 48:03.422
Where'd you learn to throw like that?

48:03.756 --> 48:06.842
Well, I was the pitcher
for my high school softball team.

48:08.010 --> 48:09.220
Full of surprises.

48:09.303 --> 48:12.098
Yeah, well, if you think
that's a surprise, try this.

48:12.181 --> 48:13.015
[Jake] Mm-hmm.

48:13.099 --> 48:15.559
How would you like to collaborate
on the Bellbird?

48:16.018 --> 48:16.852
Thank you.

48:17.103 --> 48:18.020
Thanks.

48:18.104 --> 48:19.897
What's made you change your mind?

48:19.980 --> 48:22.525
[clears throat] I'm learning
that there is a difference

48:22.608 --> 48:24.568
between someone thinking I'm helpless

48:24.652 --> 48:26.904
and someone genuinely offering me help.

48:28.781 --> 48:30.408
-Go ahead. All right, say it.
-What?

48:30.491 --> 48:31.367
"Told you so."

48:32.660 --> 48:34.703
Ah, yeah. No. I've...

48:34.787 --> 48:37.623
I've learned the hard way
that you don't like being told what to do.

48:37.706 --> 48:38.624
[Gabriela] Mmm.

48:38.707 --> 48:39.583
And besides...

48:40.292 --> 48:42.586
it'd start this partnership off
on the wrong foot.

48:44.296 --> 48:45.214
Wait, so...

48:45.506 --> 48:46.549
So that means you'll do it?

48:47.007 --> 48:47.842
Yeah.

48:48.592 --> 48:50.302
So, how do we make this partnership work?

48:51.220 --> 48:52.388
Well, what's your plan?

48:52.721 --> 48:53.556
To stay?

48:54.223 --> 48:57.101
Or go back to San Francisco
when the Bellbird's back on her feet?

48:57.184 --> 48:59.562
Well, I do have my real life
to get back to.

48:59.645 --> 49:00.771
Oh, your real life.

49:00.855 --> 49:01.939
Okay, got it.

49:02.606 --> 49:05.151
Okay, we'll do the work 50/50,

49:05.234 --> 49:06.527
split the costs 50/50,

49:06.610 --> 49:08.779
and split the profit 50/50
when we sell it.

49:09.363 --> 49:10.197
Okay.

49:10.281 --> 49:12.283
Sounds good to me, partner.

49:12.366 --> 49:13.242
Partner.

49:15.161 --> 49:16.912
You cannot get rid of this stove.

49:17.288 --> 49:20.166
This is not <i>Little House on the Prairie.</i>
We need a modern kitchen.

49:20.249 --> 49:22.251
This is a work of art, princess.
All right?

49:22.334 --> 49:24.420
It's a Waterford Stanley wood burner
from Ireland.

49:24.503 --> 49:26.464
That's nearly 400 kgs of steel.

49:26.547 --> 49:29.133
Four-hundred... Whatever.
I don't do the metric system.

49:29.216 --> 49:32.470
Listen, like your kitchen sink,
just because something's munted...

49:32.553 --> 49:34.430
-Mm-hmm.
-...it doesn't mean it can't be fixed.

49:34.513 --> 49:37.475
You've gotta work with what you have here
in New Zealand. Don't touch--

49:37.558 --> 49:39.310
["Forever" plays]

49:39.393 --> 49:40.227
Brilliant.

49:40.519 --> 49:41.687
You see? Broken.

49:43.564 --> 49:44.398
Wow.

49:44.482 --> 49:46.650
The fireplace is pure,
original craftsmanship.

49:46.734 --> 49:48.861
The woodwork alone, it tells a story.

49:48.944 --> 49:52.406
Yeah, a story that says,
"Replace me. I'm old and a fire hazard."

49:52.490 --> 49:56.327
-It's time to drag Bellbird Valley...
-Going swimmingly so far, I see.

49:56.535 --> 49:59.622
I can't quite make out if they're meant
to fall in love or kill each other.

49:59.705 --> 50:00.706
Maybe both.

50:00.789 --> 50:01.624
How exciting.

50:01.707 --> 50:02.833
[Jake] Solar panels?

50:03.501 --> 50:05.461
That'll ruin the inn's original charm.

50:06.212 --> 50:07.046
Drink this in.

50:07.630 --> 50:08.964
Glorious sunshine.

50:09.298 --> 50:10.633
Ah, yes.

50:11.091 --> 50:14.303
I want to fuel the inn with the warmth
and the power of the sun.

50:14.762 --> 50:16.055
What's more soulful than that?

50:16.138 --> 50:17.473
[Gabriela grunting]

50:18.349 --> 50:19.225
Ooh! [laughs]

50:19.308 --> 50:21.560
Sledge-hammering
should be the new self-care.

50:21.644 --> 50:23.646
It's pretty therapeutic. Good job.

50:23.729 --> 50:25.606
-Wait, wait, wait! Stop!
-What?

50:26.398 --> 50:27.233
Look...

50:29.485 --> 50:30.319
It looks like...

50:30.819 --> 50:32.154
old letters.

50:43.666 --> 50:45.876
Well, they're... love letters.

50:46.293 --> 50:48.295
But what are they doing
stuffed inside a wall?

50:48.879 --> 50:50.005
Uh, old custom.

50:50.089 --> 50:53.175
Concealing or burying items
in the structure of the house.

50:54.635 --> 50:55.469
So...

50:55.844 --> 50:56.720
enlighten me.

50:58.973 --> 50:59.974
Okay.

51:00.975 --> 51:03.394
Well, it's called immurement.

51:04.311 --> 51:05.980
So the ancient Egyptians would...

51:06.480 --> 51:09.900
leave artifacts entombed
in the pyramid walls with the pharaohs.

51:10.317 --> 51:12.152
Some say it's superstition.

51:13.112 --> 51:14.405
Some say it's good luck.

51:15.739 --> 51:17.074
But I say it's a thread...

51:17.825 --> 51:19.410
linking the past to the future.

51:22.746 --> 51:23.581
A house...

51:24.582 --> 51:27.001
A house remembers everyone
who ever lived in it.

51:32.131 --> 51:32.965
What?

51:34.967 --> 51:35.801
You were gazing.

51:36.677 --> 51:38.012
No, I wasn't.

51:38.345 --> 51:39.555
Yeah, you were.

51:40.389 --> 51:41.307
Wistfully.

51:42.891 --> 51:44.310
[softly] I don't do wistfully.

51:44.727 --> 51:46.061
[whispers] Yes, you do.

51:47.062 --> 51:47.938
Do you need a moment?

51:48.022 --> 51:49.815
I can get you some tissues.

51:49.898 --> 51:52.067
You're having fun with this, aren't you?

51:52.151 --> 51:53.235
-Kinda.
-Kinda.

51:56.697 --> 51:59.283
Do you think it's snooping
because we were looking at these letters?

51:59.366 --> 52:03.203
Oh, okay. So now someone's getting
a soft spot for dusty, old history, eh?

52:06.457 --> 52:09.918
LEDs are 80% more energy efficient.

52:10.336 --> 52:12.004
[giggles] Sweet as.

52:12.087 --> 52:15.591
-Oh, look at you, adopting the lingo, eh?
-[chuckles] Yeah, I'm trying.

52:15.883 --> 52:18.802
Also, wait. When we redo
the sink and the counter...

52:18.886 --> 52:19.720
Yeah?

52:20.054 --> 52:21.889
...can we reinstall...

52:22.514 --> 52:23.932
this? Ta-da!

52:24.016 --> 52:24.850
[laughs]

52:26.226 --> 52:28.812
What about your fancy, new faucet?

52:28.896 --> 52:32.232
Oh, it'll take all of five minutes
to swap it out for this beaut.

52:33.317 --> 52:34.193
[Jake] Man...

52:35.152 --> 52:37.613
Wow, you really like your faucets,
don't you?

52:38.656 --> 52:41.075
Shelley, where's my fertilizer?
I already checked out the back.

52:41.158 --> 52:42.159
Charlotte.

52:42.493 --> 52:44.411
It seems I'm sold out,

52:44.495 --> 52:46.455
but I will rush-order you in some more.

52:46.538 --> 52:49.750
Out? It's my special-order fertilizer.
Who else buys it?

52:51.585 --> 52:52.461
[Charlotte gasps]

52:55.798 --> 52:58.217
I have known you since kindergarten.

52:58.592 --> 53:00.511
We're Beechwood Downs, born and raised.

53:00.594 --> 53:03.263
Gabriela is an outsider, an interloper,
and you just...

53:03.347 --> 53:05.307
You give her my fertilizer?

53:05.391 --> 53:08.644
It's brand-name poop, love.
There's enough to go around.

53:11.188 --> 53:13.982
Those two look very cozy. I thought
she had a bloke back in the States.

53:14.066 --> 53:14.942
Oh, Dean?

53:15.025 --> 53:16.527
No, no, they're splitsville.

53:16.610 --> 53:17.903
I mean, they're still in touch,

53:17.986 --> 53:19.988
and, you know, she could be pining
just a little bit,

53:20.072 --> 53:21.657
but I don't think that's gonna...

53:22.408 --> 53:23.242
What?

53:24.201 --> 53:26.161
No, I know that look. Charlotte.

53:26.245 --> 53:27.705
Don't go stirring up trouble.

53:27.788 --> 53:29.248
-Me?
-Yes.

53:29.331 --> 53:30.165
Never.

53:33.252 --> 53:34.253
[exhales]

53:35.546 --> 53:37.047
[Jake] It's starting to come together.

53:37.131 --> 53:39.216
[Gabriela] These tiles match perfectly.

53:39.550 --> 53:41.552
[Jake]
They're manufactured from the same era.

53:41.635 --> 53:43.512
I got 'em online at Trade Me.

53:43.595 --> 53:46.515
Huh, look at you, embracing technology.

53:46.598 --> 53:48.434
All right. There's hope for you yet.

53:48.517 --> 53:49.560
[chuckles]

53:49.643 --> 53:50.477
Uh-oh.

53:50.769 --> 53:52.104
Want to help a girl grout?

53:52.604 --> 53:54.356
Because I cannot smooth this out.

53:54.440 --> 53:55.983
No, you've gotta go... So, just go...

53:56.066 --> 53:57.276
Yeah, this way.

53:57.359 --> 53:58.944
-[Gabriela] Oh.
-[Jake] Like that.

53:59.903 --> 54:01.864
And then, just... that's it.

54:02.406 --> 54:03.323
Out.

54:05.451 --> 54:06.285
[Jake] Yeah.

54:06.744 --> 54:07.619
Like that.

54:13.917 --> 54:14.752
You're right.

54:15.252 --> 54:16.211
She's a beaut.

54:17.796 --> 54:18.797
She sure is.

54:27.014 --> 54:28.015
[Gabriela sighs]

54:29.057 --> 54:29.892
What's that?

54:30.434 --> 54:31.602
My gray water recycler.

54:31.685 --> 54:34.146
Yeah, it treats and reuses
the dishwasher water

54:34.229 --> 54:35.731
as drip irrigation for our new garden.

54:35.814 --> 54:37.357
Ugh, that's disgusting.

54:37.441 --> 54:39.610
Wouldn't you want clean water
for your veggies? Come on.

54:39.693 --> 54:41.445
Uh, that's the point.

54:41.528 --> 54:43.113
The recycler cleans the water.

54:44.364 --> 54:45.282
Uh-huh.

54:45.741 --> 54:47.493
You're messing with me, aren't you?

54:47.910 --> 54:48.827
Easy target.

54:49.620 --> 54:50.454
Mm-hmm.

54:51.580 --> 54:53.373
No, the gray water recycler...

54:53.957 --> 54:54.792
I'm into it.

54:55.167 --> 54:57.085
Good. Me too. It's not going anywhere.

54:58.629 --> 55:00.547
Ah, it seems Gilbert's into it, too.

55:01.840 --> 55:02.674
Gilbert!

55:08.806 --> 55:10.599
[Jake] To my place.
We need to get some tools.

ate all of her avocados, so... [chuckles]

and she got her revenge.

made this place a home.

Yeah.

I moved out here after Megan passed.

57:45.879 --> 57:49.508
It's okay. I'm pretty confident
someone in town spilled the beans.

57:51.593 --> 57:52.427
Yeah.

57:52.844 --> 57:53.720
Yeah.

57:54.346 --> 57:55.180
Uh, Megan...

57:56.348 --> 57:58.308
She didn't like the rural life. It was...

57:59.476 --> 58:00.811
It was too far out for her.

So we'd been renting a place in town.

came back.

to be alone for a while.

-What?
-Was that you admitting defeat?

59:03.874 --> 59:06.710

considered defeat?

59:37.074 --> 59:38.116
It was a snake.

the old houses, huh?

01:01:12.544 --> 01:01:13.795
Is that like your thing?

01:01:14.296 --> 01:01:16.798
Well, I always took to building
since I was a little fella.

01:01:16.882 --> 01:01:19.009
You know, creating something from nothing.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:22.179
And after...

01:01:23.138 --> 01:01:27.100
Megan was gone, and after I finished
the reno at gran's place, I, uh...

01:01:28.226 --> 01:01:30.478
I found I liked fixing broken things
the most.

01:01:31.062 --> 01:01:33.231
You know, the buildings others gave up on.

01:01:34.065 --> 01:01:35.525
It's hard yakka, but...

01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:39.321
Yeah, it makes me feel
a little, uh, less...

01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:42.032
A little less broken?

01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:43.992
Yeah.

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:46.453
Something like that.

01:01:51.082 --> 01:01:51.958
Go on.

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:55.128
I spilled my guts. It's your turn.

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:57.505
Okay.

01:01:58.298 --> 01:02:01.218
Well, as I'm sure you've probably
pieced together,

01:02:01.301 --> 01:02:02.260
um...

01:02:02.344 --> 01:02:04.846
things weren't so stellar
back in San Francisco.

01:02:05.263 --> 01:02:06.640
[inhales deeply]

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:09.184
I had a low point, by which I mean...

01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:12.479
days of me laying on my couch in pajamas,

01:02:12.938 --> 01:02:15.232
drowning my sorrows in pralines and cream

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.234
and way too much wine.

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:20.987
I entered a "Win an Inn" contest.

01:02:22.697 --> 01:02:24.324
[both laugh]

01:02:26.201 --> 01:02:28.328
And as you would say,
it's been hard yakka.

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:29.704
-[laughs]
-Yeah.

01:02:30.372 --> 01:02:31.456
No, seriously.

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.292
This place has really grown on me.

01:02:34.793 --> 01:02:35.794
I'm gonna miss it.

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:39.422
You know what?

01:02:41.049 --> 01:02:44.678
Clearly, New Zealand hasn't done her job
convincing you to stay, but...

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:47.597
but we can fix that,
so I'm declaring tomorrow a holiday.

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:49.432
Okay.

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:50.392
A day off.

01:02:50.475 --> 01:02:52.310
What, you don't have those in America?

01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:54.729
No, we do, it's just
we don't really take them,

01:02:54.813 --> 01:02:56.940
you know, with the whole
career hamster wheel and all.

01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:59.401
Right. Well, I'll pick you up early.
Wear your togs, okay?

01:02:59.484 --> 01:03:00.819
-Togs?
-Yeah, your togs.

01:03:00.902 --> 01:03:03.613
And get some real boots,
not those fashion ones.

01:03:03.697 --> 01:03:04.823
Ones you can tramp in.

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:09.911
So, is this like a date with Jake?

01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:12.831
[giggles] I'm not sure,
but we're tramping.

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:14.332
Whatever that means.

01:03:14.666 --> 01:03:16.501
-[laughs]
-But what about you?

01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:18.586
How's everything with the doc?

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:22.924
Okay, so I took your advice,
and I was about to ask him out,

01:03:23.008 --> 01:03:24.634
but then he beat me to it.

01:03:24.718 --> 01:03:25.677
[gasps]

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:26.886
Details.

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:27.804
Now.

01:03:27.887 --> 01:03:30.515
He's taking me to this blues club
that's a few towns over,

01:03:30.598 --> 01:03:31.725
uh, tomorrow night.

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:34.019
Ooh, I've got a good feeling about this.

01:03:34.102 --> 01:03:35.937
It's just so weird to think
that this whole time

01:03:36.021 --> 01:03:38.940
-he was right there under my nose.
-[Gabriela] That's why you didn't see it.

01:03:39.024 --> 01:03:41.568
[Shelley] And that is exactly why
we're going to stop talking about it

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:43.320
because I'm going to jinx it otherwise.

01:03:43.403 --> 01:03:44.237
[both laugh]

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:48.950
Now, I have signed up to be the chair
of the Beechwood Downs Harvest Festival.

01:03:49.034 --> 01:03:51.786
Please tell me that you will come
and be on the committee with me.

01:03:54.247 --> 01:03:55.623
Oh, right.

01:03:56.374 --> 01:03:58.543
Right, of course.
No, you'll be long gone by then.

01:03:58.626 --> 01:04:00.462
[Gabriela] Yeah, the inn will be done
by then.

01:04:00.962 --> 01:04:01.963
You know, it's funny.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:05.216
The more I think about leaving,
the more I want to stay.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.134
[gasps]

01:04:06.217 --> 01:04:08.845
Please! I would be so stoked
if you stayed.

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:10.513
I mean, everybody would be.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:13.266
I'll tell you who wouldn't be stoked.
Charlotte.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:14.184
-[Shelley] Eh.
-Yeah.

01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:17.354
I think I've crushed her dream
of lording over a B&B empire.

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:18.355
Eh.

01:04:18.438 --> 01:04:20.398
You know, she'd pack a sad,
but that's Charlotte.

01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:22.984
And then she'd get over it.
They look great!

01:04:23.068 --> 01:04:23.902
[Gabriela giggles]

01:04:23.985 --> 01:04:27.030
Oh, you need a hot, new pair of sunnies
to go with this look.

01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:27.989
Come with me.

01:04:28.073 --> 01:04:28.990
Look, right here.

01:04:29.783 --> 01:04:31.993
[Gabriela] This looks so funny. [laughs]

01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:36.122
[Shelley] Yeah, but how good
would these look?

01:04:38.249 --> 01:04:39.125
These.

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:41.127
See? They have super cute ones.

01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:42.045
Let's see.

01:04:42.128 --> 01:04:44.172
Oh, gosh, I think I might need these.

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:49.594
[Gabriela] These are kind of cute.

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:51.304
Oh.

01:04:51.679 --> 01:04:54.516
-[Shelley] Oh, how about them?
-[gasps] I love those.

01:04:54.599 --> 01:04:57.102
-[Shelley] Yeah, you need those.
-[Gabriela laughs]

01:04:57.769 --> 01:05:00.480
-[Gabriela] I might need another option.
-[Shelley] Wait. What about...

01:05:00.855 --> 01:05:02.190
[Shelley] Yeah, okay sure.

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:05.568
[Gabriela] I like it.

01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:06.945
[Shelley] What about both, then?

01:05:07.028 --> 01:05:08.696
-[Gabriela] Okay.
-[Shelley] Yes.

01:05:09.197 --> 01:05:10.115
Yes.

01:05:10.198 --> 01:05:12.367
-[Shelley] Those are so cute.
-Cute.

01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:14.244
[Shelley] They're amazing!

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:16.079
["Many's The Time" plays]

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:20.875
[laughing]

01:05:22.877 --> 01:05:24.003
-Huh?
-Seriously?

01:05:25.004 --> 01:05:26.047
Be careful, a shark!

01:05:26.131 --> 01:05:27.215
[laughs]

01:05:27.298 --> 01:05:28.174
[Gabriela grunts]

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:30.552
-The water's like an inch--
-Don't do that!

01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:33.012
How would there be a shark in there?
The water's an inch deep.

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:35.807
-I don't know. You just scared me.
-How did you fall for that?

01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:38.601
[Gabriela] So, how is this all
in the same place?

01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:40.687
'Cause it's New Zealand.

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:42.939
And...

01:05:43.565 --> 01:05:44.399
open.

01:05:44.899 --> 01:05:45.817

Yeah, I thought you'd like it.

-I figured we'd rough it with a picnic.
-[laughs]

01:06:15.847 --> 01:06:17.515
Let me show you what's in this chilly bin.

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:19.225
Wait, chilly bin?

01:06:20.185 --> 01:06:22.937
You know, sometimes I think you make up
these adorable New Zealand terms

01:06:23.021 --> 01:06:24.022
just to tease me.

01:06:24.105 --> 01:06:25.899
It's all real. You ready for this?

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:27.775
[drumming]

01:06:27.859 --> 01:06:29.110
Go for it. [giggles]

01:06:29.402 --> 01:06:30.862
Vegemite sammie.

01:06:30.945 --> 01:06:33.239
-Oh, yummy.
-Look how good that looks.

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:35.950
Anzac biscuits.

01:06:36.367 --> 01:06:37.535
Unbelievable.

01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:39.621
Uh... L&P soda.

01:06:39.704 --> 01:06:40.538
Okay.

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:42.665
-And last but not least...
-Show me.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.126
Hokey-Pokey ice cream.

01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:46.044
-Ooh.
-Uh-huh.

01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:48.630
All right, let's just cut to the chase
and get to the good stuff.

01:06:48.713 --> 01:06:50.590
All right, I like the way
you approach a picnic.

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:52.675
All right. Oh, I also brought something.

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:57.514
Love letters.

01:06:57.847 --> 01:06:59.849
I thought you were worried about snooping.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:02.393
I may face punishment
from Mabel Browning's ghost,

01:07:02.477 --> 01:07:05.021
but I feel like it's a risk worth taking.

01:07:06.231 --> 01:07:07.065
Okay.

01:07:08.316 --> 01:07:09.484

"September 12, 1916.

The men's spirits remain high.

01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:22.789
I vow to make you proud,
my bright Firefly.

01:07:24.165 --> 01:07:27.043
To fight with honor
and to keep you with me in my heart...

01:07:27.752 --> 01:07:29.879
to give me the courage
to do what's needed.

My brave Lion,

my mother has again pressed me
to accept Reverend Williams' proposal,

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:41.891
but I do not love him.

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:45.520
I will never waver in my promise
to stay true to you.

the only light that shines

in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force,

that you are safe,

that I remain a beacon of light
guiding you in the darkness.

Did he... Did he get back from the war?

Did she kick Reverend Williams
to the curb?

01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:49.500
How did these even get in the wall?

01:08:49.584 --> 01:08:51.336
They don't use their proper names.

01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:52.837

but...

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:00.803
the letters could just be a guest's.

01:09:01.345 --> 01:09:02.346
I'd rather not know.

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:05.475
I'd like to imagine a fairy-tale ending.

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:57.858
-I arranged for a buyer.
-You what?

01:18:57.942 --> 01:18:58.984
What was that?

01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:01.612
A partner in my law firm
does real estate deals all over the world.

01:19:01.695 --> 01:19:03.489
He made an introductory phone call,
and <i>voilà.</i>

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:05.366
-Brilliant.
-Olive Flyger.

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:07.493
Representing Melbourne Land Holdings.

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:09.662
Melbourne? An Aussie?

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:13.249
Olive, this is Gabriela Diaz,
who I've been telling you all about,

01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:15.000
-and her contractor, Jack.
-Jake.

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:19.880
Jake. Melbourne Land Holdings
owns dozens of B&Bs all over Australia.

01:19:19.964 --> 01:19:22.049
We're looking to expand into New Zealand.

01:19:22.132 --> 01:19:23.175
B&Bs can't be corporate.

01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:25.135
Let's get this show on the road, shall we?

01:19:25.219 --> 01:19:26.971
-Yes.
-[Gabriela sighs] Yeah, good idea.

01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:28.472
Oh, this is a nightmare!

01:19:33.143 --> 01:19:33.978
Jake.

01:19:35.396 --> 01:19:37.398
Jake, I had no idea Dean was coming here.

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:38.732
Not my business...

01:19:39.066 --> 01:19:39.900
partner.

01:19:40.818 --> 01:19:41.652
[sighs]

01:19:41.735 --> 01:19:44.822
Welcome to the new and improved
Bellbird Valley Farm.

01:19:44.905 --> 01:19:47.408
A zero-net energy, solar powered B&B.

01:19:47.825 --> 01:19:50.369
All due to Gabriela's solar flower.

01:19:50.953 --> 01:19:54.707
It rotates, uh, collecting
the sun's energy all day long. Um...

01:19:55.207 --> 01:19:56.041
Just watch.

01:19:57.209 --> 01:20:00.254
-[Charlotte] Ugh, God.
-[Dean] Ooh, flower?

01:20:00.671 --> 01:20:01.755
[Olive and Dean] Ooh.

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:05.926
The inn's electrical is all run
through this same tablet.

01:20:06.010 --> 01:20:09.263
Everything from the lights
to the air conditioner,

01:20:09.346 --> 01:20:12.349
to the automatic door locks
can all be controlled right here.

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:16.645
-Can even sync it to your mobile phones.
-Yes, yes, the modern touch. Bravo.

01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:18.564
Let's get inside already.

01:20:19.857 --> 01:20:20.733
[Charlotte gasps]

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:25.404
Just a precaution to keep out
unwanted possums and the like.

01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:26.322
[Charlotte giggles]

01:20:26.405 --> 01:20:27.948
-It's perfect.
-Hm. [chuckles]

01:20:28.032 --> 01:20:29.616
It's even more perfect inside.

01:20:30.284 --> 01:20:31.201
Please join me.

01:20:35.247 --> 01:20:36.206
[Olive] Excuse me.

01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:37.666
Pardon me.

01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:39.960
Welcome to our kitchen.

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:45.507
The refrigerator-freezer is
an energy-efficient top-bottom model.

01:20:45.591 --> 01:20:49.470
And the dishwasher only uses
15 liters of water per cycle

01:20:49.553 --> 01:20:51.180
instead of the standard 50.

01:20:51.263 --> 01:20:52.139
Impressive.

01:20:52.222 --> 01:20:55.142
It's not as impressive
as Gabriela's gray water recycler.

01:20:55.225 --> 01:20:58.020
It reuses the dish water
to irrigate the garden,

01:20:58.103 --> 01:21:00.773
-and sometimes it waters Gilbert.
-[chuckles]

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:01.690
Who's Gilbert?

01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:02.608
[both] Our goat.

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:03.525
[Jake chuckles]

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:06.153
Hilarious. Hey, baby,

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:08.364
is that an ice cream maker
I see over there?

01:21:08.447 --> 01:21:10.324
Yes, an eco-friendly model.

01:21:11.742 --> 01:21:14.244
Childhood dream home detail. Check.

01:21:14.328 --> 01:21:15.287
I love ice cream.

01:21:15.371 --> 01:21:18.374
Fascinating! We all love ice cream!

01:21:19.458 --> 01:21:22.461
The real test of a bed and breakfast
are the guest rooms.

01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:24.671
[Dean] Hmm.

01:21:24.755 --> 01:21:26.298
-To the guest rooms.
-Yep.

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:31.303
And this is our premier guest bedroom.

01:21:33.931 --> 01:21:35.974
[Jake] Eco-friendly, non-toxic paint.

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.435
It turns out you can actually eat it.

01:21:39.937 --> 01:21:40.771
But don't.

01:21:41.772 --> 01:21:43.107
What, no TV?

01:21:43.607 --> 01:21:45.234
The house does have high-speed internet.

01:21:45.317 --> 01:21:47.903
And we'll provide iPads upon request
for streaming.

01:21:48.487 --> 01:21:49.321
Besides,

01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:51.532
who needs a TV with that view?

01:21:52.157 --> 01:21:54.493
Yeah, but I'm sure you could
add a TV later if you wanted.

01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:57.204
Well, you could.

01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:58.914
Living room!

01:22:00.958 --> 01:22:04.670
The inn's original fireplace.
Handcrafted wood and vintage tiles.

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:07.798
I wanted to replace this fireplace
with a modern gas one,

01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:11.385
but Jake convinced me
to fix up this beauty and restore it.

01:22:12.386 --> 01:22:14.972
Jake taught me
that just because something's broken,

01:22:15.556 --> 01:22:16.723
you don't throw it away.

01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:20.144
I've learned that the kiwi way of life

01:22:20.227 --> 01:22:23.188
is about fixing up what's not working

01:22:23.856 --> 01:22:25.649
and treasuring what's worth saving.

01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:30.362
And I credit Gabriela
for restoring this old inn's soul.

01:22:31.989 --> 01:22:34.032
[Olive] Sounds like
it was a labor of love.

01:22:34.116 --> 01:22:36.160
Well, this inn definitely tells a story.

01:22:36.493 --> 01:22:38.162
I think it is just brilliant.

01:22:38.245 --> 01:22:40.789
I am authorized to make an offer
right here on the spot.

01:22:40.873 --> 01:22:44.501
I can meet you tomorrow at the bank
with all the official papers. But...

01:22:45.002 --> 01:22:46.962
How does this...

01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:49.339
look to you?

01:22:50.257 --> 01:22:52.634
-Well, shoot, let's break out the bubbly.
-Wait.

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:55.846
Jake and I need to discuss something.

01:22:56.138 --> 01:22:57.389
Discuss what?

01:22:58.932 --> 01:23:00.058
So, what do you think?

01:23:00.601 --> 01:23:01.477
Well...

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:04.980
You always said the deal
was to flip and sell the inn.

01:23:06.565 --> 01:23:07.816
Should we take the offer?

01:23:10.736 --> 01:23:11.862
[Dean] Yo. Uh...

01:23:12.446 --> 01:23:14.448
-The suspense is killing us.
-Dean.

01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:16.366
-Come on, this is a no-brainer.
-We have a deal.

01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:18.452
[Dean] Yes! Oh!

01:23:18.535 --> 01:23:19.578
Yes!

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:21.413
-[Dean laughs]
-Congratulations.

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:24.291
Baby, congratulations!

01:23:24.958 --> 01:23:25.792
[Dean] Mmm!

01:23:27.294 --> 01:23:28.128
Jake.

01:23:30.422 --> 01:23:31.256
Jake.

01:23:32.591 --> 01:23:34.176
Jake, where are you going?

01:23:34.259 --> 01:23:36.261
We sold the inn. I'm finished here.

01:23:36.595 --> 01:23:37.804
Come on, mate.

01:23:37.888 --> 01:23:39.014
Cut the crap with me.

01:23:39.723 --> 01:23:41.266
I don't know why you're letting her go.

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:42.893
It seems like that's what she wants.

01:23:43.644 --> 01:23:44.478
Does it?

01:23:45.312 --> 01:23:46.522
'Cause it seems to me...

01:23:46.897 --> 01:23:49.066
you haven't told her
how you actually feel.

01:23:52.361 --> 01:23:53.195
You're right.

01:23:58.784 --> 01:24:01.411
[cell phones beeping]

01:24:02.329 --> 01:24:04.831
-[man] What's this? Do you have it, too?
-It's the Tea Rose House.

01:24:04.915 --> 01:24:06.458
-[man] Let's go, boys.
-[Jake] Let's go.

01:24:11.088 --> 01:24:12.214
[man] Get in the truck!

01:24:14.967 --> 01:24:16.677
-Where's Charlotte?
-Inside.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.220
Peter, what's going on?

01:24:18.637 --> 01:24:20.639
-[siren wailing]
-[horn honking]

01:24:25.936 --> 01:24:27.145
All right, unit.

01:24:30.691 --> 01:24:31.775
Right, set up your hoses.

01:24:31.858 --> 01:24:32.693
Chief.

01:24:36.822 --> 01:24:38.949
[indistinct chatter]

01:24:45.706 --> 01:24:47.541
-Is there anything to report?
-Chief!

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:51.753
-Are all persons accounted for?
-All but one, Chief. I can't find him.

01:24:51.837 --> 01:24:52.838
It's Mr. Patton.

01:24:53.589 --> 01:24:54.590
Take over.

01:24:55.841 --> 01:24:56.967
[fire crackling]

01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:59.344
Hello! Is anyone up there?

01:24:59.803 --> 01:25:03.098
The other way, guys! The other way!
Car coming through! Car coming through!

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:06.351
[screaming] No!

01:25:06.643 --> 01:25:07.519
[sobbing]

01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:11.815
-Oh!
-It's not safe!

01:25:11.898 --> 01:25:14.651
-I have to go in!
-Charlotte, it's not-- Charlotte!

01:25:14.735 --> 01:25:16.486
-[man] Keep running it, mate!
-[Charlotte] Oh!

01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:17.779
[coughing]

01:25:19.573 --> 01:25:20.407
Charlotte!

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:22.909
-Charlotte!
-[Charlotte coughing] Oh!

01:25:23.368 --> 01:25:24.453
[Gabriela] Charlotte!

01:25:24.536 --> 01:25:26.913
[coughs] These were my mum's!

01:25:26.997 --> 01:25:29.041
-We've gotta go. I'm sorry.
-[coughs]

01:25:29.666 --> 01:25:31.627
[man] Yeah, let's get any,
uh, additional...

01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:34.129
-Take her. Take her.
-[Charlotte coughing]

01:25:35.839 --> 01:25:37.466
-Chief Taylor, do you copy?
-Where's Jake?

01:25:37.549 --> 01:25:39.343
-[glass shatters]
-[all gasp]

01:25:40.469 --> 01:25:41.345
Jake, come in.

01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:44.014
Jake, do you copy?

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:46.975
Look.

01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:21.093
Well, I'm just glad everyone's safe.

01:26:21.176 --> 01:26:22.135
Did you call Jake?

01:26:22.219 --> 01:26:23.595
No, we haven't talked.

01:26:24.388 --> 01:26:26.431
We're supposed to meet with Olive
at the bank this afternoon.

01:26:26.515 --> 01:26:28.100
Let me know how it all goes.

01:26:28.183 --> 01:26:29.017
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:26:29.101 --> 01:26:30.644
Thank you for everything, Shelley.

01:26:30.727 --> 01:26:33.271
You've got this. And just pop by
if you need anything.

01:26:37.567 --> 01:26:39.444
Mmm. Morning, rich girl.

01:26:39.611 --> 01:26:41.905
-Mmm.
-[Gabriela] Mmm!

01:26:42.572 --> 01:26:45.158
Nothing like an inn
to sleep like a log, huh?

01:26:45.242 --> 01:26:46.493
Yes, okay.

01:26:46.576 --> 01:26:48.704
Well, as Bellbird's first guest,

01:26:48.787 --> 01:26:50.706
-I'm glad you had a good lie-in.
-Mmm.

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:53.291
But I'm afraid
you're gonna have to check out.

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:55.168
-Check out?
-Permanently.

01:26:56.002 --> 01:26:57.045
[scoffs]

01:26:57.129 --> 01:26:58.714
I appreciate you...

01:26:59.256 --> 01:27:00.257
trying to help.

01:27:01.174 --> 01:27:03.927
But these last few months
in New Zealand, I realized...

01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:05.554
we both want different things.

01:27:06.012 --> 01:27:07.597
I think that you're a great person,

01:27:07.681 --> 01:27:09.433
but you're just not my person.

01:27:09.516 --> 01:27:10.976
-[Dean scoffs]
-I'm not yours.

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:17.607
I wish you luck, Gabz.

01:27:19.025 --> 01:27:19.943
Thank you.

01:27:20.026 --> 01:27:21.737
Although, I don't think I need it.

01:27:23.029 --> 01:27:25.031
I got this... on my own.

01:27:26.116 --> 01:27:27.367
Yeah, you do.

01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:34.499
[sighs]

01:27:36.001 --> 01:27:37.919
[birds chirping]

01:27:42.507 --> 01:27:44.634
Melbourne Land Holdings
is ready to close the deal.

01:27:44.718 --> 01:27:47.012
We've prepared all the paperwork.
Have you brought the deed?

01:27:47.512 --> 01:27:48.680
Yes, I have the deed.

01:27:49.347 --> 01:27:51.933
Gabriela, you and Jake
will both have to sign it.

01:27:52.976 --> 01:27:54.770
You two sure you wanna
go through with this?

01:27:55.479 --> 01:27:58.482
-[man] You can't go in there.
-[Charlotte] I don't care. I'm going in!

01:27:58.565 --> 01:28:00.567
-Wait!
-Oh, great. She's back.

01:28:01.151 --> 01:28:02.819
You can't sell the Bellbird to her.

01:28:03.153 --> 01:28:04.362
This is all my fault.

01:28:06.156 --> 01:28:07.741
I'm the one who...

01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:11.703
took your phone and texted Dean...

01:28:12.412 --> 01:28:13.538
pretending to be you.

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:14.706
What?

01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:17.834
And brought Melbourne Land Holdings
into our lives.

01:28:19.294 --> 01:28:20.378
Gabriela...

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:23.924
inns are about home and...

01:28:24.716 --> 01:28:26.510
community and...

01:28:27.594 --> 01:28:30.096
connecting with guests
on a personal level.

01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:35.185
I could use the fire insurance money

01:28:35.268 --> 01:28:37.854

and fix up the Tea Rose House later.

that I should stay here.

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:09.594
And... after yesterday's fire, it was...

01:29:10.136 --> 01:29:12.264

would be a waste of time.

You're one of us now.
The Bellbird's in safe hands. Oh!

01:29:50.176 --> 01:29:52.262
-Thank you.
-Oh, hugging. [shudders]

Oh, Jake.

We are partnered 50/50 on the inn.

01:30:03.481 --> 01:30:05.108
You want to tell me your terms?

Hi.

Are you mad about earlier?

01:30:44.314 --> 01:30:47.442
Oh, yeah. You mean the part where
you turned down a massive pay day

01:30:47.525 --> 01:30:48.526
for the two of us...

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:50.236
and then asked my terms?

01:30:51.863 --> 01:30:52.989
I did do that, didn't I?

01:30:54.407 --> 01:30:55.533

going back over a hundred years.

01:31:29.859 --> 01:31:31.069
You wrote me a letter?

01:31:31.653 --> 01:31:34.322
Seems to be what you do
when you want to make history.

01:31:41.788 --> 01:31:42.914
"Dear Gabriela,

01:31:44.749 --> 01:31:47.669
as promised, I have thought about
my terms for the inn.

01:31:48.378 --> 01:31:49.671
They are as follows:

01:31:52.841 --> 01:31:56.344
there will always be ice cream
in a picnic-ready chilly bin,

01:31:57.303 --> 01:31:59.347
a stuffed possum guarding the fireplace,

01:31:59.431 --> 01:32:02.058
and a rascally goat
who has the run of the farm.

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:06.354
Bellbird is your dream home,
and it turns out it's mine, too.

01:32:09.107 --> 01:32:10.817
I'm thinking
the tradition of letter writing

01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:12.402
is something we can keep up...

01:32:13.069 --> 01:32:14.571
when we are running the inn...

01:32:16.072 --> 01:32:16.990
together.

01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:21.619
With all my heart, Jake."

01:32:22.412 --> 01:32:24.998
I'm hoping that this is a love letter
and...

01:32:25.832 --> 01:32:27.876
and not a... not a business agreement.

01:32:30.253 --> 01:32:31.755
It's definitely a love letter.

01:32:34.257 --> 01:32:36.760
Then I guess I might get
my fairy-tale ending, too.
