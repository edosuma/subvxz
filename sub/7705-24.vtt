WEBVTT

00:03.437 --> 00:06.238
Hold it.
I haven't had my dessert.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.678
Oh, gross! What is that?

00:13.314 --> 00:16.081
It's a slimeball.

00:16.083 --> 00:19.084
- ALF!
- I know what you're gonna say.

00:19.086 --> 00:21.220
I shouldn't bring treats
to the table

00:21.222 --> 00:23.522
unless I have enough
for everyone.

00:24.625 --> 00:27.493
- Well, we're in luck.
- No, we're not.

00:27.495 --> 00:30.896
You sure? There's a surprise
in the center.

00:30.898 --> 00:34.433
- ALF, where did you get those?
- Melmac.

00:34.435 --> 00:38.370
I usually buy wild cherry
but all they had left was slug.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.839
- Oh!
- ALF.

00:40.841 --> 00:43.042
What's the surprise
in the center?

00:43.044 --> 00:44.476
I'll give you a hint.

00:44.478 --> 00:47.379
In wild cherry, it was a cherry.

00:48.582 --> 00:52.618
- We'll pass.
- Okay. More for me.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.186
You know, it's a lucky thing
I found these

00:54.188 --> 00:56.055
when I was cleaning out
my spaceship.

00:56.057 --> 00:58.390
Couple of more months
and they would've gone bad.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.859
- Oh, no!
- Oh, they're not that stale.

01:00.861 --> 01:04.630
- No, i-it's a roach!
- Roach?

01:04.632 --> 01:06.432
Well, I think someone's been

01:06.434 --> 01:08.934
slacking off
on her housekeeping.

01:09.970 --> 01:12.037
It came from your bag.

01:13.207 --> 01:15.507
Well...needless to say..

01:15.509 --> 01:19.011
...that's the last time
I shop at Ed's Bakery.

01:19.013 --> 01:22.014
[theme music]

01:52.213 --> 01:55.414
[music continues]

02:22.643 --> 02:24.776
- Where'd the roach go?
- It ran under the bag.

02:24.778 --> 02:27.246
- Somebody step on it.
- There it goes.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.848
- Oh!
- Look, it has blue eyes!

02:29.850 --> 02:32.651
Of course it does.
It's a roach.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.520
ALF, roaches don't
have blue eyes.

02:34.522 --> 02:37.556
They have..
I don't know what they have.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.825
Well, on Melmac,
their eyes are blue.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.393
Haven't you ever
heard the expression

02:41.395 --> 02:44.796
"Her eyes were as blue
as a roaches?"

02:44.798 --> 02:47.833
- Would somebody just squash it?
- Wait a minute, Kate.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.435
This thing came
all the way from Melmac.

02:50.437 --> 02:52.538
It's a unique specimen.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.674
We already have
a unique specimen from Melmac.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.912
You're comparing me
to a cockroach?

02:59.914 --> 03:03.282
- I'm gonna get the spray.
- Answer me!

03:03.284 --> 03:04.816
But, mom, wait!

03:04.818 --> 03:06.818
I wanna take it
to show-and-tell.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.755
It will be
just as interesting dead.

03:09.757 --> 03:12.624
Do you have to kill it,
I mean, couldn't you just..

03:12.626 --> 03:15.360
...I don't know, like let it
loose in the backyard?

03:15.362 --> 03:17.829
No, no,
here's what we should do.

03:17.831 --> 03:20.299
We should catch it,
I'll build a little box

03:20.301 --> 03:22.534
we'll put a piece of doughnut
right in the middle.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.169
Then, you guys
make sure that ALF

03:24.171 --> 03:26.838
doesn't get to the doughnut
before the roach does.

03:26.840 --> 03:27.973
Then, I'll..

03:27.975 --> 03:29.975
[hissing]

03:35.316 --> 03:37.716
Never mind the box.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.118
You mentioned something
about a doughnut?

03:40.120 --> 03:42.421
Mom, you didn't have to kill it.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.590
Roaches are filthy
disgusting creatures

03:44.592 --> 03:46.525
that carry disease.

03:46.527 --> 03:49.728
I thought we were
talking about doughnuts.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.763
There is no doughnut.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.665
Can we give the roach
a funeral?

03:53.667 --> 03:57.069
We shouldn't bury it,
we should keep it for studying.

03:57.071 --> 04:00.973
I'm just curious. What kind of
doughnut would it have been?

04:02.009 --> 04:04.409
- Plain.
- Plain?

04:04.411 --> 04:07.446
With all the choices
they have nowadays?

04:07.448 --> 04:09.748
Can we forget
about this doughnut?

04:09.750 --> 04:11.383
Well, you got me going.

04:11.385 --> 04:15.554
ALF, we are trying to figure out
what to do with the roach.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.623
Why? It's gone.

04:18.859 --> 04:21.260
- What?
- Look, it's not there anymore.

04:21.262 --> 04:22.394
Where did it go?

04:22.396 --> 04:23.962
Maybe you didn't
spray it enough.

04:23.964 --> 04:28.600
- I used half a can.
- I'll be right back.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.202
Where are you going?

04:30.204 --> 04:33.605
I'm going to call
a doughnut place that delivers!

04:36.110 --> 04:39.678
Come on, everybody.
We are gonna find that roach.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.748
- Kate, calm down!
- Calm down?

04:42.750 --> 04:45.984
There is a space-roach
loose in our house.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.720
Well, maybe it went somewhere
to die with dignity.

04:50.124 --> 04:51.990
Psst, Willie.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.792
Yeah, alright, ALF

04:53.794 --> 04:55.260
you can order the doughnuts.

04:55.262 --> 04:59.598
I already did. But that's not
why I said psst.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.733
Well, why did you say, "Psst?"

05:01.735 --> 05:03.802
Just come out here.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.474
What is all this secrecy about?

05:09.476 --> 05:11.009
I didn't want to upset Kate.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.278
W-what is it
that would upset Kate?

05:13.280 --> 05:17.516
I believe a foot-long cockroach
would upset Kate.

05:22.556 --> 05:25.090
Old blue eyes is back.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.561
[screeching]

05:29.563 --> 05:32.564
[instrumental music]

05:33.567 --> 05:34.866
Come on, you guys,
I told grandma

05:34.868 --> 05:36.168
we'd be at her place
in ten minutes.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.003
Can the cockroach
come with us?

05:38.005 --> 05:41.139
Brian, I think you're
missing the point of this trip.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.342
Just get packed, please,
let's get in the car.

05:43.344 --> 05:44.776
Mom, why do we
have to take so much?

05:44.778 --> 05:47.446
I mean, we're coming back.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.448
We are coming back, aren't we?

05:49.450 --> 05:52.384
Yes, when the cockroach
is killed.

05:52.386 --> 05:53.885
But it was killed before.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.822
This time I want to see a body.

05:57.825 --> 06:00.025
- Good news.
- It's dead?

06:00.027 --> 06:03.061
Well, let's just say, it's got
three feet in the grave.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.063
The exterminator's
on his way over.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.466
[sighs]
We don't need an exterminator.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.801
We need Sigourney Weaver.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.739
Kate, unpack your bags.

06:13.741 --> 06:16.541
ALF, cancel the exterminator.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.344
I've killed the roach.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.580
Honey, that's wonderful.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.682
Tell us how you
killed the roach.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.784
Yeah, how'd you kill Rodney?

06:26.587 --> 06:30.856
You named it...after my brother?

06:30.858 --> 06:33.759
- I, I, I can't help, but--
- Willie.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.094
How did you kill the roach?

06:36.096 --> 06:38.063
I used the spray.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.198
Did you actually see the body?

06:40.200 --> 06:42.334
- I saw it hit the floor.
- And then?

06:42.336 --> 06:44.269
And then I came in here.

06:44.271 --> 06:47.139
So we're talking about
an unconfirmed kill.

06:48.142 --> 06:49.808
Technically.

06:50.477 --> 06:52.210
Let's go, kids. Come on.

06:52.212 --> 06:55.680
Wait! Kate, I emptied
a whole can of spray on it.

06:55.682 --> 06:58.350
I tell you, it's dead.

06:58.352 --> 07:00.352
[thudding]

07:01.822 --> 07:04.055
Call me when you
get to your mother's.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.391
Keep in touch, Willie.
Let's go, Kate.

07:06.393 --> 07:08.427
Say, you're not going anywhere.

07:08.429 --> 07:10.162
That's your roach.

07:10.164 --> 07:12.898
It was my roach
when it was an inch long.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.567
Now it belongs to the world.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.502
Stay right where you are.

07:17.504 --> 07:19.671
I-I'll call you
when the exterminator leaves.

07:19.673 --> 07:22.574
- Goodbye, honey. Be careful.
- Bye.

07:22.576 --> 07:25.577
- Bye, dad. Bye, Rodney!
- Bye. Rodney.

07:25.579 --> 07:26.912
Bye, daddy.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.680
Listen, if it goes into my room

07:28.682 --> 07:31.416
I don't wanna know about it.
Bye, ALF.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.788
Listen, what's that exterminator

07:36.790 --> 07:38.890
plan to use on this thing?

07:38.892 --> 07:41.693
I don't know. Spray.

07:41.695 --> 07:44.496
- Hmm.
- Hmm, what?

07:44.498 --> 07:47.265
Well, maybe nothing, but..

07:47.267 --> 07:50.335
...we started with a roach
this big.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.003
Kate sprayed it, a minute later

07:52.005 --> 07:54.506
it was big enough
to wear a sweater.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.975
Then you sprayed it again.

07:56.977 --> 08:00.111
Now, I hate to extrapolate,
but--

08:00.113 --> 08:04.883
ALF, what happened when you
sprayed roaches on Melmac?

08:04.885 --> 08:07.919
We didn't have spray on Melmac..

08:07.921 --> 08:11.122
...which, in retrospect,
seems like a pretty good thing.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.457
[thudding]

08:12.459 --> 08:15.093
[roach scurrying]

08:15.095 --> 08:17.863
W-what's it doing back there?

08:17.865 --> 08:20.465
Anything it wants to.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.467
[doorbell rings]

08:23.904 --> 08:25.737
You-you better hide
in the kitchen.

08:25.739 --> 08:29.474
Oh, great! The one place
roaches always go.

08:29.476 --> 08:32.444
Would you rather
hide back there?

08:32.446 --> 08:35.881
If you need me I'll be on top
of the refrigerator.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.953
- Exterminator.
- Oh, right.

08:41.955 --> 08:44.122
- Where are they?
- In the bedroom.

08:44.124 --> 08:47.058
Uh, but, actually there aren't
really all that many.

08:47.060 --> 08:51.162
Actually, uh,
there's...just one.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.697
One roach?

08:52.699 --> 08:54.566
Hmm, just the one, yes.
Mm-hmm.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.768
What're you,
some kind of phobic?

08:57.304 --> 08:58.937
Phobic?

08:59.973 --> 09:01.106
Yes.

09:01.108 --> 09:04.309
Alright, I'll go kill the roach.

09:04.311 --> 09:07.245
Wait, wait just
a minute, please.

09:07.247 --> 09:10.682
- You-you can't use that spray.
- Why not?

09:10.684 --> 09:12.217
Because..

09:12.219 --> 09:15.186
...who knows what effect
it'll have on the roach.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.389
Well, if history's any teacher

09:17.391 --> 09:20.225
the general effect
will be death.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.061
Ideally...yes.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.431
But this is a special roach.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.733
What is it? A pet?

09:28.735 --> 09:31.269
Don't use the spray.

09:31.838 --> 09:34.406
Fine. I won't.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.408
I don't believe you.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.411
Give me the tank.

09:41.315 --> 09:44.549
Want my shoes too?
So I don't step on it?

09:44.551 --> 09:46.851
I was hoping
you might be able to suggest

09:46.853 --> 09:49.588
some more scientific way
to kill it.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.089
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:51.091 --> 09:54.626
I left my heat-seeking missile
in the car.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.695
Oh, now you're making fun of me.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.029
Yes, I am.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.465
I'll just take a magazine
and whack it.

10:02.469 --> 10:04.336
Uh, wait, wait.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.272
Take this instead.

10:15.749 --> 10:18.350
Psst! Did you warn him?

10:18.352 --> 10:19.551
Yeah.

10:19.553 --> 10:22.520
But I...I don't think
he believed me.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.424
[man screaming]

10:26.426 --> 10:29.060
Maybe you'd better open
the front door.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.532
Let me out of here! Ah!

10:38.739 --> 10:41.973
I...I've got to see this
for myself.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.111
You want me
to hold the door open?

10:48.849 --> 10:50.949
How big did it get?

10:50.951 --> 10:53.952
Well, that depends.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.788
Do you measure
at the shoulder or the head?

10:56.790 --> 10:59.991
[instrumental music]

11:03.864 --> 11:06.598

11:09.069 --> 11:10.368
(ALF)
'Let's go, Willie!'

11:10.370 --> 11:13.271
We're all packed
and I started the car.

11:13.273 --> 11:16.174
We're not running away
from this roach.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.044
You didn't hear me,
I said, we're driving away

11:19.046 --> 11:21.279
from this roach.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.416
No, I'm not giving up.

11:24.418 --> 11:26.418
I'm gonna find something
to kill it.

11:26.420 --> 11:29.921
Well, may I suggest
the national guard.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.823
I'd prefer a method
that would keep us

11:31.825 --> 11:34.025
off the 6 o'clock news.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.293
Alright, I'll see you later.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.629
D stands for drive, right?

11:40.467 --> 11:42.534
ALF, look..

11:42.536 --> 11:45.570
...panicking is not
gonna help anything.

11:45.572 --> 11:48.973
Yeah, right.
Let's just sit around and read.

11:48.975 --> 11:52.077
This is not reading.
This is research.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.713
I'm going to solve this problem

11:54.715 --> 11:57.215
with a calm, clinical approach.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.819
That's exactly what
those guys in Detroit said.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.253
Then one morning they woke up

12:02.255 --> 12:06.124
and found themselves
infested with jaffees.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.593
- Jaffees?
- Yeah.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.328
Bloodsucking maggots

12:10.330 --> 12:12.731
that take the shape
of their host.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.933
[hisses]

12:16.269 --> 12:17.736
Detroit?

12:17.738 --> 12:20.839
- Michigan?
- You amaze me.

12:20.841 --> 12:24.042
You think that's the only
Detroit in the universe?

12:24.044 --> 12:27.445
- Where's the other one?
- On Melmac.

12:27.447 --> 12:30.181
Lot of good R&B groups
came out of there.

12:30.183 --> 12:33.084
Thank you, ALF. Thank you.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.286
But if we could
stick to the problem.

12:35.288 --> 12:38.289
We're supposed to be
finding a way to kill roaches.

12:38.291 --> 12:41.659
I thought of one,
but you didn't like it.

12:41.661 --> 12:44.662
I don't have a harpoon.

12:44.664 --> 12:46.397
Whose fault is that?

12:46.399 --> 12:49.834
I mean, you can't expect me
to take care of everything.

12:49.836 --> 12:53.538
I think I may have discovered
a less violent solution.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.373
Now, all these books say

12:55.375 --> 12:59.244
that the best way to kill
roaches is with boric acid.

12:59.246 --> 13:02.614
Oh, yeah, that's what
they used on the jaffees.

13:02.616 --> 13:04.149
Well, did it work?

13:04.151 --> 13:05.683
Let's put it this way.

13:05.685 --> 13:09.420
Detroit became known
as Jaffee Town.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.489
Maybe they didn't have
the right concentration.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.391
Fortunately,
I have access to all

13:13.393 --> 13:15.927
the latest scientific research.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.163
"McCall's?"

13:18.165 --> 13:21.032
They did an article
on poison, okay?

13:21.034 --> 13:23.468
(Trevor)
'Yo, Tanner, you in there?'

13:23.470 --> 13:26.371
Quick, ALF...
under the counter.

13:26.373 --> 13:29.574
It's crawling with spiders
back there!

13:30.443 --> 13:31.509
Go!

13:31.511 --> 13:34.746
Well, can I at least
take something to read?

13:34.748 --> 13:36.414
Here.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.083
"Steve Allen's World Of Bugs."

13:39.085 --> 13:41.719
Great. I've already read it.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.130
- Hi, Tanner.
- Hi, Trevor.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.699
I saw the exterminator
leave your house in such a hurry

13:54.701 --> 13:56.835
he dropped his tank.

13:56.837 --> 13:59.070
- Bugs?
- Oh, yeah.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.973
We, uh, have a little
cockroach problem.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.808
Ah, yeah, cockroaches.

14:03.810 --> 14:07.378
Blattella germanica,
our little prehistoric friend.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.581
You know, cockroach fossils
have been found

14:09.583 --> 14:12.150
that are over
three hundred million years old.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.718
That's nice, Trevor.

14:13.720 --> 14:17.322
I'll never forget the cockroach
problem we had back in Korea.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.656
They were everywhere.

14:18.658 --> 14:21.659
You took a step,
it was like walking on crackers.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.729
Isn't that interesting.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.798
There's more.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.466
I'm sorry, please go on.

14:28.468 --> 14:31.002
We used to have to go to sleep
with our boots on.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.837
Because you know
the oriental ones

14:32.839 --> 14:36.808
when they bite,
they secrete this weird saliva.

14:36.810 --> 14:39.244
Kinda like meat tenderizer.

14:39.246 --> 14:42.647
- No!
- Yeah.

14:42.649 --> 14:45.583
You get enough of that
in your system, forget it.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.819
They showed us
a movie about it.

14:47.821 --> 14:49.954
David Niven was brilliant.

14:49.956 --> 14:52.523
Well, I'll see ya.

14:52.525 --> 14:53.958
Oh, by the way..

14:53.960 --> 14:56.794
...I took the liberty
of spraying around your house.

14:56.796 --> 14:59.130
- You what?
- Yeah.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.633
I noticed the exterminator
forgot to do it.

15:01.635 --> 15:04.369
So I dosed it up
for ya real good.

15:04.371 --> 15:08.273
- No charge.
- Oh, no!

15:09.109 --> 15:11.442
I said, no charge.

15:12.212 --> 15:15.413
[instrumental music]

15:25.225 --> 15:27.525
Where are you going?

15:27.527 --> 15:29.661
Oh, I'm going to the drugstore.

15:29.663 --> 15:32.230
I'm gonna buy
all the boric acid they've got.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.965
But you heard Trevor.

15:33.967 --> 15:36.534
What if you come back
and I've been tenderized?

15:36.536 --> 15:39.737
I-I-I won't be gone long.
I'll only be gone five minutes.

15:39.739 --> 15:43.107
- Take me with you.
- You know I can't.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.476
Well, throw me in the trunk.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.712
There's no air.
You'll suffocate.

15:47.714 --> 15:51.549
I'll wear scuba gear.
That'll give me 30 minutes.

15:51.551 --> 15:55.186
Plus, if you drive off a bridge,
I'll survive.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.790
I haven't got time to argue.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.291
Alright, go!

16:00.293 --> 16:03.261
First, Kate and the kids,
now you.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.663
I feel like
the pretty, little virgin.

16:05.665 --> 16:06.698
The-the what?

16:06.700 --> 16:08.399
You know,
the apple-cheeked maiden

16:08.401 --> 16:12.270
that the cowardly townspeople
feed to the dragon.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.572
Don't you read fairy tales?

16:16.076 --> 16:17.542
This is a discussion

16:17.544 --> 16:20.044
that we're going to postpone.

16:20.046 --> 16:22.847
- I'm leaving now.
- Fine.

16:22.849 --> 16:26.651
I'll just toddle off into
the kitchen and saute myself.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.620
Oh, ALF..

16:29.622 --> 16:32.790
...you know I wouldn't leave you
if I had any other choice.

16:33.693 --> 16:36.027
Then hug me.

16:36.029 --> 16:38.896
- What?
- I want a hug.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.365
Why?

16:40.367 --> 16:43.668
Well, because we may
never see each other again.

16:43.670 --> 16:47.038
And we've never
taken the time to..

16:47.040 --> 16:49.607
...you know...hug.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.987
Now tell me you love me.

17:02.989 --> 17:04.489
[sobbing]
Ooh, ALF.

17:04.491 --> 17:07.558
Alright, alright,
just hurry back, okay?

17:07.560 --> 17:09.594
- And don't stop for anything.
- No, no.

17:09.596 --> 17:12.730
- Uh, except maybe some more--
- Doughnuts.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.935
Jelly!

17:19.005 --> 17:21.406
Alright, I should take it easy.

17:21.408 --> 17:23.775
I mean, the only thing
we have to fear

17:23.777 --> 17:25.910
is fear itself.

17:25.912 --> 17:29.313
Whoever said that must've
had a lot of bodyguards.

17:29.315 --> 17:31.516
[roach chirping]

17:32.852 --> 17:35.653
Be strong, be strong.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.993
[chirping continues]

17:41.995 --> 17:45.363
Be afraid, be very afraid.

17:46.900 --> 17:50.601
Listen, you don't wanna eat me!
I'm pure gristle!

17:50.603 --> 17:53.204
My whole family
has an aftertaste.

17:53.206 --> 17:56.174
If you can hold out,
there's doughnuts on the way.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.642
[clattering]

17:57.644 --> 18:00.445
Good idea! Put some coffee on.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.447
[clattering continues]

18:02.449 --> 18:04.549
[roach chirping]

18:04.551 --> 18:06.184
[glass shattering]

18:06.186 --> 18:08.386
[screaming]

18:11.191 --> 18:13.925
Oh! I should've guessed.

18:13.927 --> 18:16.461
It probably likes gristle.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.497
Now I feel like a tease.

18:24.471 --> 18:27.605
Hello, operator,
this is an emergency!

18:27.607 --> 18:29.407
Give me the fire department

18:29.409 --> 18:32.376
or the police,
or the paramedics, somebody.

18:32.378 --> 18:34.612
I don't care, you decide.

18:35.548 --> 18:38.549
Hello? Fire department?

18:38.551 --> 18:40.585
Uh, well, I need you
to come out here.

18:40.587 --> 18:44.055
There's a giant cockroach
trying to kill me!

18:45.692 --> 18:49.060
Alright then. I'm a cat
and I'm stuck in a tree.

18:49.062 --> 18:51.295
Whatever it takes!

18:51.297 --> 18:54.232
[thudding]

18:54.234 --> 18:56.434
[roach chirping]

18:57.537 --> 19:00.071
Operator, make it
the paramedics!

19:00.073 --> 19:02.073
[ALF screaming]

19:05.245 --> 19:06.744
Whoever builds the doors
on this planet

19:06.746 --> 19:08.379
ought to be horsewhipped!

19:08.381 --> 19:09.747
[pounding on door]

19:09.749 --> 19:11.682
Occupied!

19:13.253 --> 19:15.419
Alright, the party's over!

19:15.421 --> 19:19.090
I've got a 357
and I know how to use it!

19:22.595 --> 19:25.630
No one's ever told me
where these things lead.

19:26.966 --> 19:29.200
Nah!

19:29.202 --> 19:31.903
[banging on door]

19:31.905 --> 19:34.005
Oh, you want to use
the bathroom!

19:34.007 --> 19:37.508
Is that it?
Hey, hey, I know the feeling!

19:38.411 --> 19:41.212
[roach chirping]

19:41.214 --> 19:43.481
[ALF screaming]

19:43.483 --> 19:47.118
Look, you're angry at the world,
I understand that, uh

19:47.120 --> 19:49.554
you probably didn't get
enough love as a larva.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.522
Uh, but-but I've got an idea.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.090
We could sit down, talk

19:53.092 --> 19:55.760
have a nice cold glass
of boric acid.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.795
You know, we could deal with it,
what do you..

19:57.797 --> 20:01.132
What do you think about that?
Ever see one of these, huh?

20:01.134 --> 20:03.568
Take that, you..

20:03.570 --> 20:06.470
Uh, uh, I was only kidding.
Joke, joke.

20:06.472 --> 20:08.039
Yeah, you know what,
I've got the number

20:08.041 --> 20:10.441
of a good psychiatrist
friend of mine.

20:10.443 --> 20:13.044
He, uh, he deals
with psychopathic ants

20:13.046 --> 20:16.347
and, uh, and roaches!
Here, here, take this!

20:16.349 --> 20:18.115
[ALF grunting]

20:18.117 --> 20:20.785
Now you'll smell good too.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.558
[crickets chirping]

20:29.028 --> 20:30.995
ALF! ALF, are you okay?

20:30.997 --> 20:34.599
Oh, hi, Willie.
Did you get the doughnuts?

20:34.601 --> 20:38.502
ALF...w-w-what did you do?

20:39.072 --> 20:40.504
Nothing much.

20:40.506 --> 20:42.540
Watched a little TV.

20:42.542 --> 20:45.343
Killed the bug.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.445
How did you kill it?

20:48.848 --> 20:50.748
Cheap cologne.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.984
That's perfume.

20:52.986 --> 20:56.487
I bought that for Kate
on her last birthday.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.990
You had roach problems
then too?

21:00.860 --> 21:03.427
How did you know to use this?

21:03.429 --> 21:06.530
Well, I analyzed
the list of ingredients

21:06.532 --> 21:08.866
and based on what I know
about the physiology

21:08.868 --> 21:10.801
of Melmacian cockroaches--

21:10.803 --> 21:13.704
- ALF.
- I lucked out.

21:14.974 --> 21:18.509
I can't believe you took this
roach on all by yourself.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.845
You could've been killed.

21:20.847 --> 21:25.283
When it comes to defending
my home I'm an animal.

21:25.285 --> 21:28.152
That's just the way I'm made.

21:29.455 --> 21:30.988
Well, I'm going to, uh..

21:30.990 --> 21:33.624
...I'm gonna drag this outside
before Kate gets back.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.459
No, don't rough it up!

21:35.461 --> 21:38.462
Once they dry out,
they get brittle.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.031
What difference does that make?

21:40.033 --> 21:41.565
Are you kidding?

21:41.567 --> 21:43.534
I plan to have that guy stuffed

21:43.536 --> 21:46.337
and mounted ASAP.

21:46.339 --> 21:49.206
I thought it would look good
over the fireplace.

21:49.208 --> 21:51.075
We're getting rid of it!

21:51.077 --> 21:52.943
[telephone ringing]

21:54.247 --> 21:57.948
Hello? Oh, hi, Kate.
I was just about to call you.

21:57.950 --> 22:00.217
I've got some good news
about the roach.

22:00.219 --> 22:04.422
And some bad news
about your birthday present.

22:04.424 --> 22:07.625
[instrumental music]

22:11.597 --> 22:13.297
- Goodnight, ALF.
- Hey, Brian.

22:13.299 --> 22:14.965
How about a bedtime story?

22:14.967 --> 22:17.968
I'm too tired
to tell you one tonight.

22:17.970 --> 22:21.639
- No, I'll tell you one.
- Oh, okay.

22:21.641 --> 22:24.842
What do you wanna hear?
"Babar The Elephant?"

22:24.844 --> 22:26.977
"The Princess And The Pea?"

22:26.979 --> 22:29.447
Or "Brave ALF

22:29.449 --> 22:32.083
And The Giant Cockroach?"

22:32.085 --> 22:36.821
- I'll go with the princess.
- Fine, read it yourself.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.624
What'd you do
with the cockroach?

22:40.626 --> 22:42.960
We found a dump
that doesn't ask questions.

22:42.962 --> 22:45.896
Too bad they don't give a prize
for the weirdest garbage.

22:45.898 --> 22:47.998
ALF, did you check
your spaceship

22:48.000 --> 22:50.768
see if there were
any more cockroaches?

22:50.770 --> 22:52.737
Consider it roachless.

22:52.739 --> 22:55.206
But you-you sprayed
everything with perfume

22:55.208 --> 22:56.741
just in case?

22:56.743 --> 22:59.009
Well, everything but my gym bag.

22:59.011 --> 23:01.178
I don't want to get funny looks
if I ever go back

23:01.180 --> 23:03.414
to my health club.

23:03.416 --> 23:05.616
What, what is this plant?

23:05.618 --> 23:07.385
Looks kind of like
a Venus flytrap.

23:07.387 --> 23:11.021
- 'Hmm.'
- It is. From Venus.

23:11.023 --> 23:14.692
[sighs]
I want that out of this house.

23:14.694 --> 23:17.261
Why? It's just a plant.

23:17.263 --> 23:20.631
It brightens up the room,
gives off oxygen.

23:20.633 --> 23:22.733
It eats insects.

23:23.469 --> 23:25.603
And pencils.

23:26.506 --> 23:27.772
I'll get the perfume.

23:27.774 --> 23:29.540
I'll call and see
if the dump is still open.

23:29.542 --> 23:33.844
I'll take back the boric acid
and get some defoliant.

23:33.846 --> 23:36.280
You people
are getting good at this.

23:38.351 --> 23:40.351
[instrumental music]

23:44.357 --> 23:47.358
[theme music]

24:11.284 --> 24:14.285
[ALF laughing]
