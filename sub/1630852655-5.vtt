WEBVTT

00:01.240 --> 00:02.580
(machine beeping)

00:02.680 --> 00:05.380
- I'm nearly there, get off.
- We've gotta go.

00:05.480 --> 00:08.380
- [Lana] Get down!
(bomb crashing)

00:08.480 --> 00:11.060
- The HMX-319 comes from Porton Down,

00:11.160 --> 00:12.540
but they couldn't tell me any more.

00:12.640 --> 00:14.340
It's classified, Lana.

00:14.440 --> 00:15.500
- There's a single bombing campaign

00:15.600 --> 00:17.980
run by one group, the Crusaders.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.780
- There's another member of
the cell, the bomb maker.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.540
(suspenseful music)
(explosion crashing)

00:23.640 --> 00:24.660
They know call-out times,

00:24.760 --> 00:26.920
how we think, how we move, everything.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.320
It's got to be an inside man.

00:33.840 --> 00:34.740
- Come on.
- Jesus Christ.

00:34.840 --> 00:36.660
- I can't ignore your conduct.

00:36.760 --> 00:38.580
I think you should take
some personal leave.

00:38.680 --> 00:39.980
- We believe your brother is involved

00:40.080 --> 00:41.180
with the Crusaders cell.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.980
- I'm sorry, sir, are you
sure you mean my Billy?

00:44.080 --> 00:44.820
- [Billy] My mate asked me

00:44.920 --> 00:46.920
to give some of the lads a lift down.

00:47.480 --> 00:48.740
Must be some kind of joke.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.740
- [Lana] They're not
who you think they are.

00:50.840 --> 00:51.900
- [Billy] Looks like a bomb.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.380
- Gonna go to Cranstead Fields, Billy.

00:54.480 --> 00:55.260
Billy, I'm here.

00:55.360 --> 00:56.500
- [Billy] Lana, it's
about three minutes, yeah?

00:56.600 --> 00:58.340
You've gotta get me out the car.

00:58.440 --> 00:59.500
- The timer, it means nothing.

00:59.600 --> 01:02.340
They put it there as a trick
so that you open the door.

01:02.440 --> 01:03.180
- Lana, please don't go.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.060
- You've gotta trust me.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.440
Listen to me, I'm your sister.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.860
- Lana, Lana, do something.

01:09.960 --> 01:11.700
- [Costa] Suspect is
unlocking door, repeat.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.060
- [Lana] Billy!

01:13.160 --> 01:16.220
(explosion crashes)

01:16.320 --> 01:17.460
- Might be an idea for you

01:17.560 --> 01:19.540
to move in here with me, you know.

01:19.640 --> 01:22.660
- So is that what we are, then, mates?

01:22.760 --> 01:24.760
- You tell me.

01:25.840 --> 01:29.240
(soft suspenseful music)

01:33.480 --> 01:36.960
(haunting dramatic music)

01:52.880 --> 01:55.480
(somber music)

02:22.560 --> 02:25.960
(somber music continues)

02:49.080 --> 02:51.840
(dramatic music)

03:02.880 --> 03:04.880
- All right?
- Yeah.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.200
It's a bit of a mess.

03:21.080 --> 03:23.140
- Haven't really been getting
much response from my texts,

03:23.240 --> 03:24.380
so I just thought I'd come over

03:24.480 --> 03:26.480
and just make sure you're okay.

03:29.720 --> 03:31.720
- I'm sorry.
- No.

03:35.480 --> 03:37.480
Come here.

03:46.720 --> 03:49.060
Look, why don't we just
get you some bags packed?

03:49.160 --> 03:51.500
Get you over to mine, get you moved in.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.640
Means I can look after you, properly.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.560
- Not now, Thom, it's not the right time.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.440
- Okay.

04:05.400 --> 04:08.280
- Have you, um, heard any more about John?

04:10.400 --> 04:12.060
- We didn't find anything on him.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.160
- What?

04:15.080 --> 04:17.260
(sighs) It's just, that's impossible.

04:17.360 --> 04:18.100
- We've looked through

04:18.200 --> 04:20.200
his entire comms history,
Lana, he's clean.

04:21.680 --> 04:22.860
- Then you need to look harder,

04:22.960 --> 04:24.960
you must be missing something, like.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.200
I don't get it.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.180
- Well, look, I couldn't
stay for long anyway,

04:50.280 --> 04:52.280
so I should probably get back.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.040
I'll just give you some space.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.480
(somber music)

05:17.240 --> 05:19.240
- All right?

05:25.120 --> 05:27.560
- No, but you know how it is.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.880
- I do.

05:34.760 --> 05:37.140
I know us lot don't really do talking,

05:37.240 --> 05:41.240
but if you wanted to, I'm right here.

05:43.200 --> 05:46.120
Or not, I'm happy just sitting here.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.040
- If Billy would have trusted me,

05:56.720 --> 05:58.940
he'd have been okay.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.140
- How do you mean?

06:01.240 --> 06:04.840
- Well, we were, we were close,

06:05.960 --> 06:07.960
and then life got in the way.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.360
My job got in the way.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.620
But I know if we were still tight

06:14.720 --> 06:17.000
he would have listened
to me, I know he would.

06:22.240 --> 06:24.920
It's all down to me, everything.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.200
- I know how it feels to
carry the guilt, you know.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.080
Do you remember the first time

06:36.160 --> 06:38.160
you stood in front of a device?

06:39.480 --> 06:41.380
The sheer terror.

06:41.480 --> 06:44.740
But now, after years and
years of training, nothing.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.840
Autopilot, no nerves.

06:47.760 --> 06:50.420
But that's just us, right?

06:50.520 --> 06:53.100
Wasn't that your brother didn't trust you.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.240
He wouldn't have known
what the fuck was going on.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.940
So don't beat yourself up over it.

06:59.040 --> 07:01.940
You're a good EXPO, and a great person,

07:02.040 --> 07:04.540
and no one could have done any more.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.640
- Who knows?

07:08.640 --> 07:11.560
But thank you for saying that.

07:16.920 --> 07:18.920
You remind of Nut.

07:20.360 --> 07:25.020
- Wow, well, he was a great person.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.120
- Yeah, he was.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.860
- That's probably the nicest thing

07:30.960 --> 07:32.960
anyone has ever said to me.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.600
Not a lot of compliments
where I come from.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.800
You know, I really think we've
got loads of stuff in common.

07:44.520 --> 07:47.380
Things we've been through and
come out on the other side.

07:47.480 --> 07:49.480
I really feel like you get me.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.400
- Don't know if I get myself.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.720
- I get you.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.600
- (sighs) I'm knackered.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.780
Head off?

08:06.880 --> 08:08.880
- Yeah, of course.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.120
What do you feel like doing?

08:18.920 --> 08:20.980
Could watch a film or something.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.240
What is it the kids
say, Netflix and chill?

08:24.760 --> 08:26.620
- Yeah, I think, um, I'm just gonna go

08:26.720 --> 08:30.260
and be by myself for a
bit, if that's all right.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.360
- Yeah, of course.

09:41.680 --> 09:45.100
(dramatic somber music)

09:45.200 --> 09:47.680
(Lana crying)

09:55.120 --> 09:57.640
(door creaks)

10:02.360 --> 10:04.540
- [Marianne] Thanks for this, Lana.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.640
I know it can't be easy.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.200
- I want to help, ma'am.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.260
- First thing to say is
that our initial findings

10:14.360 --> 10:17.280
point to Billy being unaware
of the Farringdon VBIED plot.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.780
A pressure plate was
rigged under his seat,

10:20.880 --> 10:22.880
set to arm the door when he got up.

10:24.480 --> 10:27.180
Billy's actions in driving
away from Farringdon

10:27.280 --> 10:29.280
helped save many lives.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.380
- We've been establishing a
timeline of Billy's movements

10:32.480 --> 10:34.340
in the days leading up to the incident,

10:34.440 --> 10:36.780
using comms history and interviews.

10:36.880 --> 10:40.340
We geo-located Billy to
an address in Streatham,

10:40.440 --> 10:43.040
registered to a Thomas Marshall.

10:44.360 --> 10:48.500
- Yeah, Tommy was an old mate of Billy's.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.300
- We believe that Billy stayed with Tommy

10:50.400 --> 10:52.940
until the morning of
the anti-fascist demo,

10:53.040 --> 10:55.260
and then set off on public transport

10:55.360 --> 10:56.820
to an address in Brixton,

10:56.920 --> 10:58.940
spending approximately one hour there

10:59.040 --> 11:00.900
before heading north in his car.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.180
- This is when he tripped the ANPR camera.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.280
From then on we have his movements.

11:06.280 --> 11:10.180
- We called your mobile phone at 11:41 am,

11:10.280 --> 11:12.840
and you were at O'Hara's Pool Hall.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.760
You didn't say who you were with.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.720
- Just some mates, ah, Danny and Mike.

11:23.440 --> 11:26.980
- Billy had been charged with
racially aggravated assault.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.060
He was due to stand trial next month.

11:29.160 --> 11:31.880
Had he previously shown
any far-right inclinations?

11:34.400 --> 11:36.840
- No, ah, not like that.

11:41.640 --> 11:45.600
He was, he was easily led, naive.

11:47.360 --> 11:50.620
- [Thom] Did Billy ever
mention someone called Frank?

11:50.720 --> 11:52.300
- No.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.460
- We uncovered a number of messages

11:54.560 --> 11:56.780
sent between Billy and
an individual named Frank

11:56.880 --> 11:58.100
over the course of the last week

11:58.200 --> 12:00.200
on an encrypted messaging service.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.420
And from the nature of them,

12:02.520 --> 12:04.420
we believe Frank is connected to,

12:04.520 --> 12:07.060
or a member of, the Crusaders.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.720
(solemn music)

12:12.160 --> 12:14.160
- They groomed him.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.420
- [Samira] When forensics
were processing Billy's flat,

12:16.520 --> 12:19.620
they found DNA matching an
individual on our system.

12:19.720 --> 12:24.360
- Frank Adrian Welsh, born
Dagenham, 7th of June 1978.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.820
Did time for armed robbery.

12:27.920 --> 12:29.920
Released from prison three years ago.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.660
He's a former member of English Flag.

12:33.760 --> 12:36.700
We believe he was amongst those members

12:36.800 --> 12:38.500
expelled by Agatha Jack.

12:38.600 --> 12:39.940
- We've established a connection

12:40.040 --> 12:42.260
between him and Nic Roberts.

12:42.360 --> 12:45.060
In late 2019, Welsh and Roberts

12:45.160 --> 12:47.680
both attended the same
rehabilitation group.

12:48.520 --> 12:52.680
- Welsh was in the Territorial
Army between 2005 to 2014.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.640
His record shows explosives training.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.340
- So he fits the profile of the bomb maker

13:01.440 --> 13:03.440
that we've been looking for.

13:04.320 --> 13:07.320
- We agree, this is the man we're after.

13:12.760 --> 13:16.280
- Ma'am, ma'am, can I have a word, please?

13:17.400 --> 13:19.460
I need to return to work.

13:19.560 --> 13:20.820
I need it and you need it.

13:20.920 --> 13:23.700
- Lana, you've been
exposed to extreme trauma.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.820
Notwithstanding my
concern for your welfare,

13:25.920 --> 13:29.260
our protocols require a
set period off active duty.

13:29.360 --> 13:30.860
- Yeah, I get it, but this is not the time

13:30.960 --> 13:32.900
to be one EXPO down.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.900
And without blowing my own trumpet,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.460
you brought me on as senior for a reason.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.980
- It's not about your
level of experience, Lana.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.260
After all you've been through,

13:41.360 --> 13:43.100
we need to give you
all the support we can.

13:43.200 --> 13:46.340
- I'm ready, and I was wrong about John,

13:46.440 --> 13:49.720
but I need to do all I
can to get Frank Welsh.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.860
- I would want daily reports
after each job you're sent to,

13:58.960 --> 14:01.620
and you'll need ongoing support
from occupational health.

14:01.720 --> 14:02.420
It's not that we don't have

14:02.520 --> 14:04.300
the utmost faith in your ability,

14:04.400 --> 14:06.860
it's that we have a duty of care to you.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.960
- Understood, whatever it takes.

14:11.160 --> 14:12.620
- Um, before we begin,

14:12.720 --> 14:15.740
there's a short questionnaire to fill in.

14:15.840 --> 14:18.960
It's standard practice
for all new patients.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.640
- Cheers.

14:24.120 --> 14:25.040
- [MacAndrew] I see from your case file

14:25.120 --> 14:28.340
that you've been on active
service since you left school.

14:28.440 --> 14:30.500
For the last five years

14:30.600 --> 14:33.340
with the Met Police and
before that the army?

14:33.440 --> 14:36.560
- Er, yeah, I served two
tours in Afghanistan in EOD.

14:40.360 --> 14:42.360
Thanks.
- Thank you.

14:44.480 --> 14:47.640
I see you've ticked no to every question.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.600
- Yeah.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.080
- You're gonna have to trust me.

14:57.760 --> 14:58.820
And you're gonna have to be honest

14:58.920 --> 15:00.920
about how you're feeling.

15:05.320 --> 15:08.780
Do you discuss things or share feelings

15:08.880 --> 15:11.020
with your friends or colleagues?

15:11.120 --> 15:12.860
- Not really, no.

15:12.960 --> 15:14.340
We're focused on the job,

15:14.440 --> 15:18.480
and not talking about our feelings.

15:19.760 --> 15:22.920
- When you're away from the
job, is it hard to switch off?

15:27.800 --> 15:29.800
- Yeah, it can be.

15:32.320 --> 15:37.320
Which can be difficult
for the people around me,

15:38.960 --> 15:41.320
um, my partner.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.180
Nut used to say that, um,

15:50.280 --> 15:53.240
EOD stood for Every One Divorced,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
which isn't far from the truth.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.120
- So how you feeling right now?

16:08.480 --> 16:11.920
- My job is to keep people safe,

16:14.720 --> 16:16.720
and I haven't been able to.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.600
- Yeah.

16:21.280 --> 16:24.360
- There was a gentleman
called Ali Hussein,

16:25.800 --> 16:28.920
who was a father and a husband.

16:31.720 --> 16:34.960
I just couldn't get to the device in time.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.560
My brother.

16:44.560 --> 16:48.120
(gentle melancholic music)

16:49.400 --> 16:51.400
And, um, Nut,

16:52.560 --> 16:56.600
my number one, my friend.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.120
- And how does it feel
carrying that responsibility?

17:10.000 --> 17:14.020
- (sighs) I, I don't
know how to answer that.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.720
(solemn music)

17:18.560 --> 17:21.700
- [Thom] That's how we
came to identify him.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.440
Tracking down Frank Welsh
is our number one priority.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.380
Forget what's going on in your lives,

17:27.480 --> 17:29.900
this is the only thing you
should be thinking about.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.460
I want unit cars outside
all his known addresses.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.500
I want his friends and family interviewed.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.900
Someone knows something.
Let's get cracking.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
I want results today.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.120
- Hi.
- Hey.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.980
- Um, well, it sounds like
the manhunt's in full swing.

17:47.080 --> 17:50.140
You okay? Can I help with anything?

17:50.240 --> 17:52.840
- Yes, um, have you got a minute?

17:59.840 --> 18:02.960
It's just that you said
you'd been playing pool

18:03.960 --> 18:06.160
with Danny and Mike.

18:10.240 --> 18:12.680
It's just that I know, from the duty log,

18:14.040 --> 18:16.040
they were both at HQ at the time.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.320
So, I don't understand.

18:26.760 --> 18:28.760
- Yeah, I was with someone else.

18:29.720 --> 18:32.320
(solemn music)

18:38.400 --> 18:39.260
- So what does that mean?

18:39.360 --> 18:41.360
Does that mean, um,

18:42.160 --> 18:45.160
does that mean it's over between us?

18:49.760 --> 18:51.760
- I don't know.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.280
- I should get back.

19:09.920 --> 19:14.720
- Fucking hell. (sighs)

19:16.320 --> 19:17.820
- [Simon] Here we are, a day
away from the by-election,

19:17.920 --> 19:19.820
and Agatha Jack and English Flag

19:19.920 --> 19:22.220
still haven't produced a clear policy.

19:22.320 --> 19:24.900
Are they taking their
supporters for granted?

19:25.000 --> 19:26.820
Or is it the so-called
progressive alliance

19:26.920 --> 19:28.660
that's making your blood boil?

19:28.760 --> 19:29.500
Tell us what you think.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.060
Join me, Simon Shenley,
after the latest travel news.

19:32.160 --> 19:33.620
- This guy is so biased.

19:33.720 --> 19:35.140
- Hey, why we even listening to this?

19:35.240 --> 19:36.820
What happened to that
old dad rock channel,

19:36.920 --> 19:37.900
whatever we were listening to?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.140
(Hass chuckling)

19:39.240 --> 19:41.240
- Dad rock?

19:42.560 --> 19:45.700
(audience clapping)

19:45.800 --> 19:47.220
- Thanks, guys, thank you.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.880
(upbeat music)

19:56.160 --> 19:58.940
Welcome to the show, a special edition

19:59.040 --> 20:01.660
coming from the University
of South London.

20:01.760 --> 20:04.180
We're here to discuss
the upcoming by-election.

20:04.280 --> 20:08.020
By-elections in marginal seats
are always a big news story,

20:08.120 --> 20:10.540
but this one is particularly significant,

20:10.640 --> 20:12.700
coming at a time when London is facing

20:12.800 --> 20:14.380
a critical threat level.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.140
So who's most likely to win?

20:16.240 --> 20:18.780
We'll discuss that, as well
as the progressive alliance

20:18.880 --> 20:21.060
between the left-leaning candidates.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.580
If you're just tuning into this story,

20:22.680 --> 20:24.540
it's a deal that has been
struck between the Lib Dems,

20:24.640 --> 20:27.820
Greens and Labour in a bid
to funnel voters away.

20:27.920 --> 20:28.660
- All right, Wash?
- Hey.

20:28.760 --> 20:29.580
- [Simon] From English Flag.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.460
- All right, stranger?
- All right.

20:31.560 --> 20:33.820
Turn that down, Danny.
- Gladly.

20:33.920 --> 20:36.580
- Right, listen up,
I've been briefed by HQ.

20:36.680 --> 20:39.860
We've got a name for the
bomber, it's Frank Welsh.

20:39.960 --> 20:40.980
Now, he's a devious shit.

20:41.080 --> 20:42.180
He doesn't care who he hits,

20:42.280 --> 20:44.580
whether it's police or civilians.

20:44.680 --> 20:45.660
We know he likes secondaries,

20:45.760 --> 20:47.260
so we need to watch out for that.

20:47.360 --> 20:48.940
We also know he likes a tilt switch,

20:49.040 --> 20:50.620
so don't even think about moving anything

20:50.720 --> 20:52.100
until it's been cleared.

20:52.200 --> 20:54.140
He's trying to have a little
bit of fun with the EXPO,

20:54.240 --> 20:56.780
get in our heads, waiting
for us to make a mistake.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.580
- Piece of work.

20:58.680 --> 21:01.880
- Yeah, so, I need you all
to be on top of your game.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.400
I'm not losing anyone else.

21:05.920 --> 21:07.860
(somber music)

21:07.960 --> 21:11.440
(camera shutter clicking)

21:13.560 --> 21:16.560
(suspenseful music)

21:25.960 --> 21:27.960
- Mate, I'm so sorry.

21:34.040 --> 21:36.040
It's good to see you back.

21:38.360 --> 21:40.660
- That the device from Cranstead Fields?

21:40.760 --> 21:44.780
- Yeah, I managed to
build this reconstruction.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.760
The timer was definitely
a dummy, I'm so sorry.

21:54.280 --> 21:58.400
Oh, before I forget, I've been
wanting to give you these.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.420
Forensics unit two bagged
them up at Westhaven

22:01.520 --> 22:02.940
but not processed them.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.020
You know how it gets after a big sweep.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.120
Lost in an evidence locker.

22:09.200 --> 22:12.760
- Nut's snips. Thanks.

22:17.240 --> 22:20.020
- Look, I, um, I double
checked with Porton Down

22:20.120 --> 22:22.120
about the HMX we found.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.820
A guy owes me a favour at the lab.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.980
He was able to copy across the file data

22:29.080 --> 22:31.300
associated with the batch.

22:31.400 --> 22:32.700
Porton Down have said the files

22:32.800 --> 22:36.860
on HMX-319 are classified,
but look at this.

22:36.960 --> 22:40.140
(suspenseful music)

22:40.240 --> 22:41.380
- I don't know what you're showing me,

22:41.480 --> 22:44.580
there's nothing there, it's empty.

22:44.680 --> 22:46.680
Just numbers, 661142.

22:48.280 --> 22:49.500
- Yeah, exactly, that's it.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.900
That was all that was in the file.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.580
It's been wiped clean.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.860
Perhaps, perhaps this is standard protocol

22:55.960 --> 22:59.520
to manage sensitive historic
files, I don't know.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.380
From the export code I know

23:02.480 --> 23:04.260
it was produced for
license in Afghanistan,

23:04.360 --> 23:06.500
if that's any help?

23:06.600 --> 23:09.380
So, this is either
routine housekeeping or.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.480
- They're trying to cover their tracks.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.340
(phone rings)

23:16.440 --> 23:18.440
- DI Desai.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.980
Received. Security alert
at South London University.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.080
- Shit.
- SCO-19 assigned.

23:26.880 --> 23:29.880
(suspenseful music)

23:32.680 --> 23:33.700
- [Dispatcher] Evacuation in progress

23:33.800 --> 23:35.900
at the University of South London.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.340
A suspect package has been found

23:37.440 --> 23:40.020
during the transmission
of a radio talk show.

23:40.120 --> 23:41.660
All units to university.

23:41.760 --> 23:43.820
- EXPO two, received.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.660
(siren wailing)

23:46.760 --> 23:49.520
(dramatic music)

23:52.080 --> 23:54.180
- At 2:05 pm a member of the security team

23:54.280 --> 23:56.180
noticed a suspicious item,

23:56.280 --> 23:58.260
which was hidden amongst
the recording equipment

23:58.360 --> 24:00.300
brought in for broadcast.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.100
They checked their CCTV and a man

24:02.200 --> 24:05.820
can be seen moving equipment,
who isn't one of their staff.

24:05.920 --> 24:08.820
So we went through all the IDs
that were shown at the entry

24:08.920 --> 24:10.920
and we came up with this fake one.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.160
It's Welsh.

24:15.160 --> 24:17.300
The talk show panel have
gone to a safe location

24:17.400 --> 24:19.400
in case they were his intended target.

24:21.440 --> 24:24.420
We've blocked all roads
within a one-mile radius,

24:24.520 --> 24:27.460
but he could be in the
vicinity and he could be armed.

24:27.560 --> 24:30.060
Let's keep our eyes open, okay?

24:30.160 --> 24:32.160
- Understood.

24:35.160 --> 24:37.380
Okay, listen up, Frank Welsh is confirmed

24:37.480 --> 24:39.100
as the subject of interest.

24:39.200 --> 24:41.780
You've all been briefed on his appearance.

24:41.880 --> 24:44.020
Secure your positions.

24:44.120 --> 24:46.120
- [Officer] Yes, sir.

24:49.920 --> 24:52.760
(crowd murmuring)

24:55.720 --> 24:57.880
- Trojan four one, in position.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.960
(suspenseful music)

25:13.720 --> 25:16.040
- [Costa] Trojan five four, in position.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.420
- Yo.
- All right?

25:24.520 --> 25:26.300
- [Danny] Yeah.

25:26.400 --> 25:29.340
- Right, keep your eyes
peeled while we're inside.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.640
It'll be radio silence
while we're in there.

25:32.960 --> 25:34.820
John, you're with me.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.860
- All right, do you want
me to hold your hand?

25:36.960 --> 25:38.960
Show you how to do it proper?

25:41.600 --> 25:43.600
Give me the vest.

25:45.160 --> 25:50.160
(crowd muttering)
(sirens wailing)

26:02.920 --> 26:03.940
- Lana.
- Yeah.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.100
- You all right?

26:05.200 --> 26:05.940
- Yeah.
- It's okay,

26:06.040 --> 26:07.500
you got this, okay?

26:07.600 --> 26:10.300
Now, bring it in, all right?

26:10.400 --> 26:13.120
- Cheers, John, let's go.

26:17.360 --> 26:20.080
(dramatic music)

26:22.200 --> 26:22.960
- [MacAndrew] You were telling me

26:23.040 --> 26:25.040
about how you fight the urge to run.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.800
- I make it personal.

26:35.080 --> 26:37.080
What scares us is the unknown,

26:38.040 --> 26:40.640
so you have to try and get
inside the bomber's head.

26:42.080 --> 26:44.100
Why have they put that device there?

26:44.200 --> 26:46.200
Are they playing mind games?

26:46.960 --> 26:48.380
Is this what it looks like,

26:48.480 --> 26:50.480
or is there something more complex?

26:52.240 --> 26:54.060
That's where my focus is,

26:54.160 --> 26:56.360
that's how I shut out the fear.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.460
- The device is up ahead.

27:01.560 --> 27:03.100
- [Lana] Yeah, I know.

27:03.200 --> 27:05.200
- Well, come on then.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.520
- It's me and the device.

27:09.080 --> 27:11.080
Me and the bomber.

27:12.640 --> 27:14.640
Me versus him.

27:15.320 --> 27:18.160
(scanner beeping)

27:31.480 --> 27:34.880
(soft suspenseful music)

27:37.560 --> 27:38.300
- All right, Wash?

27:38.400 --> 27:40.400
- [Lana] Yeah, just give me a minute.

27:47.920 --> 27:51.240
- I, ah, I've been meaning to say, Wash.

27:52.560 --> 27:54.560
I'm sorry about your
Billy, he was a good kid.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.820
- What the fuck?

27:57.920 --> 27:59.340
Not now, yeah, John?

27:59.440 --> 28:00.380
- Can't say anything, can I,

28:00.480 --> 28:03.160
without you biting me head off.

28:11.520 --> 28:14.280
(dramatic music)

28:15.840 --> 28:17.780
- Central seven four, keep all crowd back.

28:17.880 --> 28:19.880
Repeat, all crowd back.

28:21.320 --> 28:23.340
Any visuals on suspect?

28:23.440 --> 28:26.240
(crowd muttering)

28:27.240 --> 28:29.460
- [Robins] Trojan one, negative.

28:29.560 --> 28:32.000
- [Brown] Trojan three
six, negative here too.

28:35.920 --> 28:37.540
- Here you are, mate.

28:37.640 --> 28:39.640
- Ta.

28:40.200 --> 28:42.200
- It's not poisoned.

28:43.080 --> 28:45.460
- [Lana] Right, we've got
a mobile phone and a timer,

28:45.560 --> 28:47.660
but it's just blinking.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.440
- Yeah, decoy timer, remote detonation.

28:51.600 --> 28:54.020
Like you say, this fucker
likes to mess with us.

28:54.120 --> 28:55.900
There's no rush, Wash.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.620
- Yeah, got all day, haven't we?

28:58.720 --> 29:00.720
Right, get back.

29:01.280 --> 29:04.280
(suspenseful music)

29:11.000 --> 29:13.520
- [Costa] Trojan five four,
still no obs on Welsh.

29:22.800 --> 29:27.000
- Shit, two phones, one
to prime, one to trigger.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.580
Right, can you go and
speak to DI Youngblood?

29:30.680 --> 29:32.300
Tell him to look out for any suspects

29:32.400 --> 29:34.440
that might be carrying two mobile phones.

29:36.160 --> 29:40.580
- No, you go, I'll stay.
- No, you go.

29:40.680 --> 29:42.720
I'm gonna set up the pigstick to disrupt.

29:47.440 --> 29:50.160
(dramatic music)

29:57.640 --> 29:59.460
- EXPO seven, we've located IEDs,

29:59.560 --> 30:01.500
a mobile phone initiating device.

30:01.600 --> 30:05.100
Two mobiles attached, one
to prime, one to trigger.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.500
- Central seven four, received.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.040
Okay, eyeballs on anyone
with two mobile phones.

30:14.120 --> 30:16.120
Everyone's got their bloody phone out.

30:17.240 --> 30:20.240
(suspenseful music)

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
- Damn.

30:38.640 --> 30:40.260
Hang on.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.340
Trojan five four, I have
a visual on a suspect.

30:42.440 --> 30:44.440
He's carrying two mobile phones.

30:47.480 --> 30:49.180
(phone ringing)
- Shit.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.280
The device is armed.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.460
Pigstick's in place but I've
got to complete the circuit.

30:58.560 --> 30:59.940
- Right, I'll set up.

31:00.040 --> 31:02.040
- Yeah, go, go, go.

31:03.640 --> 31:05.340
- [John] EXPO seven, device is armed.

31:05.440 --> 31:07.440
Repeat, device is armed.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.300
- [Costa] Where are you?

31:10.400 --> 31:13.380
(dramatic music)

31:13.480 --> 31:14.980
Got ya, Trojan five four,

31:15.080 --> 31:16.820
I have a good visual again on the suspect.

31:16.920 --> 31:19.400
He's looking at the
building, two phones in play.

31:20.320 --> 31:22.600
- [Robins] Trojan one,
received, is it Welsh?

31:23.760 --> 31:26.540
- Trojan five four,
positive ID, Frank Welsh.

31:26.640 --> 31:28.640
I'm taking the shot.

31:29.760 --> 31:32.120
(gun bangs)

31:36.000 --> 31:38.880
Trojan five four, suspect down.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.360
- Trojan one received, EMT required.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.220
Trojan one to EXPO seven.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.100
We've taken down Frank Welsh.

31:47.200 --> 31:49.760
He was carrying two phones, now inactive.

31:51.440 --> 31:53.440
- EXPO seven, received.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.580
Wash.
- Yeah.

31:56.680 --> 31:58.740
- Suspect's down.

31:58.840 --> 32:00.540
- [Lana] Is it Welsh?

32:00.640 --> 32:01.380
- [John] They think so.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.340
- Okay, good, I'm gonna
disrupt any minute now.

32:03.440 --> 32:05.300
- [John] Right, all the pressure's off.

32:05.400 --> 32:06.740
- Okay.

32:06.840 --> 32:09.440
(solemn music)

32:18.600 --> 32:20.420
- EXPO seven, we're about to disrupt.

32:20.520 --> 32:23.200
(phone chiming)

32:24.760 --> 32:27.520
(dramatic music)

32:37.880 --> 32:40.100
(phone ringing)

32:40.200 --> 32:42.200
- Shit!

32:46.640 --> 32:48.740
Hard cover!

32:48.840 --> 32:50.620
- [Thom] Get down, take cover!

32:50.720 --> 32:53.040
- Come on, come on, come on.

32:53.960 --> 32:57.040
(explosion crashing)

33:04.920 --> 33:07.680
(dramatic music)

33:12.840 --> 33:15.740
- We have eye witness
reports of John Hudson

33:15.840 --> 33:18.800
fleeing the scene
seconds before the blast.

33:19.960 --> 33:22.500
And mobile data confirms
that he used his mobile

33:22.600 --> 33:24.260
in the seconds before the device

33:24.360 --> 33:27.040
at the University of South
London was triggered.

33:28.160 --> 33:30.820
Frank Welsh was the caller
to the primer phone.

33:30.920 --> 33:33.480
When he was killed, Hudson took over.

33:34.760 --> 33:37.660
In the last hour we've been
able to make a positive match

33:37.760 --> 33:42.580
between his phone and the
trigger phone on the device.

33:42.680 --> 33:44.140
- We've now established
that the explosive used

33:44.240 --> 33:46.860
at the university attack was the same mix

33:46.960 --> 33:49.860
as that in the device
at Westhaven, Amburiq

33:49.960 --> 33:52.100
and the Five Oaks.

33:52.200 --> 33:53.980
More explosive has been discovered

33:54.080 --> 33:56.080
at a property belonging to John Hudson.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
It's undergoing analysis.

33:59.880 --> 34:01.980
- From the Security Service point of view,

34:02.080 --> 34:06.260
John Hudson is not a name
we've previously encountered.

34:06.360 --> 34:08.980
Had he been under investigation?

34:09.080 --> 34:11.900
- John Hudson had been under surveillance,

34:12.000 --> 34:14.260
and he fits our working profile.

34:14.360 --> 34:18.760
However, until now we had no
evidence of his involvement.

34:19.720 --> 34:23.100
- Okay, we now have a potential suspect

34:23.200 --> 34:25.460
to track down, John Hudson.

34:25.560 --> 34:27.340
Member of the Met EXPO team,

34:27.440 --> 34:29.300
a highly trained military veteran.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.900
It is imperative that
we locate and detain him

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
as soon as possible.

34:35.600 --> 34:38.100
Okay, everyone, let's get to work.

34:38.200 --> 34:40.880
(all muttering)

34:48.000 --> 34:49.820
- What are you doing here?

34:49.920 --> 34:52.420
- Ah, look, the last time I saw you,

34:52.520 --> 34:54.540
the way we left things, I was out of order

34:54.640 --> 34:58.300
assuming you'd come back
with me or I'd come to yours.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.620
I don't want you to think that.

34:59.720 --> 35:01.780
I'm not trying to pressure you.

35:01.880 --> 35:04.120
- I didn't think that,
honestly, it's fine.

35:09.120 --> 35:11.500
Look, I've just come back
to pick some stuff up.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.600
I've got to go back to work.

35:17.640 --> 35:18.380
- I know you're so used to

35:18.480 --> 35:20.540
doing all the tough things
in life by yourself.

35:20.640 --> 35:23.560
I get it, but I can help.

35:25.280 --> 35:27.440
We're the same, you
just need to let me in.

35:28.320 --> 35:29.620
I feel for the first time I've met someone

35:29.720 --> 35:31.660
who can make sense of my life,

35:31.760 --> 35:34.120
and I want you to give me the
chance to do the same for you.

35:37.760 --> 35:38.940
- That's really kind, Karl.

35:39.040 --> 35:40.820
Honestly, I really appreciate it.

35:40.920 --> 35:43.760
It's just my head is all
over the shop at the minute.

35:46.720 --> 35:51.720
- Yeah, I know you're
going through so much,

35:53.120 --> 35:55.120
but I just wanted to say my piece.

35:57.080 --> 36:01.220
- Thanks, see ya.
- See ya.

36:01.320 --> 36:04.480
(gentle bright music)

36:16.640 --> 36:18.640
- Hey.
- Hi.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.060
- John Hudson's place?

36:23.160 --> 36:25.160
- [Sonya] Bagged and tagged.

36:28.360 --> 36:32.100
- I just don't understand
how an EXPO could do this.

36:32.200 --> 36:35.780
We all know the damage IEDs
do, the lives that are lost.

36:35.880 --> 36:38.020
The whole purpose of our
job, of our existence,

36:38.120 --> 36:40.140
is to stop this from happening.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.900
How does somebody's head flip?

36:42.000 --> 36:44.140
He even lied to my face about Billy,

36:44.240 --> 36:46.420
about being sorry, about Billy.

36:46.520 --> 36:47.300
- [Sonya] I know, Wash, I-

36:47.400 --> 36:49.400
- [Thom] Yeah, thanks.

36:50.040 --> 36:52.340
- DI Youngblood, I was, um,

36:52.440 --> 36:53.780
I was just about to explain to Wash

36:53.880 --> 36:56.980
that the chemical explosive
found at John Hudson's place

36:57.080 --> 36:59.660
was an exact match of the HMX-319

36:59.760 --> 37:01.760
that was used in the Crusader devices.

37:02.880 --> 37:04.700
Also, despite the device functioning,

37:04.800 --> 37:06.620
some parts I was able to study in depth

37:06.720 --> 37:09.660
and I found this in the
interior of the device.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.700
- [Lana] Yeah, 1912.

37:11.800 --> 37:13.060
- You saw something
similar written on the wall

37:13.160 --> 37:15.160
at Westhaven, didn't you?
- Yeah.

37:16.480 --> 37:19.560
- It's a message, someone's
trying to tell us something.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.260
- This the A-Z he used?

37:22.360 --> 37:24.360
- Yeah, I've got a scan somewhere.

37:29.120 --> 37:31.160
- Look, Lana, um, about John.

37:36.120 --> 37:38.120
Sorry I doubted you.

37:38.600 --> 37:42.340
- No, not as sorry as
I am that I was right.

37:42.440 --> 37:43.980
- These are all the pages
that he'd written on,

37:44.080 --> 37:46.220
made notes and so on.

37:46.320 --> 37:48.660
Synagogues, mosques, gay pubs.

37:48.760 --> 37:51.840
- Five Oaks pub, Amburiq Mosque.

37:53.440 --> 37:55.020
He was thorough.

37:55.120 --> 37:56.460
- Hang on, on the Amburiq Mosque page

37:56.560 --> 37:58.740
there's something else marked.

37:58.840 --> 38:00.840
- [Lana] I didn't see that before.

38:03.240 --> 38:06.100
- Hey, ah, yeah, I need a
background check on an address.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.200
Caredale Road, SE1.

38:08.560 --> 38:10.720
- [Sonya] don't recognise
that, it sounds residential.

38:12.680 --> 38:14.140
- Okay, listen to me, get ahold

38:14.240 --> 38:16.100
of the Labour candidate and their security.

38:16.200 --> 38:17.060
Tell them we're on our way.

38:17.160 --> 38:19.760
It's the progressive alliance
campaign headquarters.

38:20.960 --> 38:24.780
(suspenseful dramatic music)

38:24.880 --> 38:27.560
(siren wailing)

38:50.040 --> 38:52.740
Miss Campbell-Khan?
- What's going on?

38:52.840 --> 38:54.420
- We've had intelligence
of a potential attack.

38:54.520 --> 38:56.140
We just need to make sure
the office is secure.

38:56.240 --> 38:58.180
Um, would anyone know your timetable?

38:58.280 --> 39:00.500
- Sure, I post regular
updates on social media.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.420
I mean, that's half the job these days.

39:02.520 --> 39:05.900
- Yeah, no, I understand,
um, if you could just.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.260
It's just a safety precaution,

39:07.360 --> 39:08.740
it'll be temporary, thank you.

39:08.840 --> 39:09.660
- Thanks.
- Thank you very much.

39:09.760 --> 39:10.500
Thank you.

39:10.600 --> 39:13.240
(siren wailing)

39:18.360 --> 39:21.180
- Lana, we've been running plate checks

39:21.280 --> 39:23.140
with all vehicles to
ensure they're registered

39:23.240 --> 39:25.820
to residents or visitors,
and we've been alerted

39:25.920 --> 39:28.860
to one that appears to be a
long-term parking violation.

39:28.960 --> 39:30.960
Come, follow me.

39:31.520 --> 39:33.020
We've cleared the rest of the street.

39:33.120 --> 39:34.660
- [Lana] Nice one.

39:34.760 --> 39:37.920
(soft dramatic music)

39:45.920 --> 39:47.660
Excuse me, whose is that car?

39:47.760 --> 39:48.860
Do you know whose this car is?

39:48.960 --> 39:50.660
- Officer, I'll take over from here.

39:50.760 --> 39:52.220
You need to take that off and put it down.

39:52.320 --> 39:53.020
- I'm a council contractor.

39:53.120 --> 39:55.120
- You need to take it off and put it down.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.400
Have you got any ID? Come on.

40:08.920 --> 40:09.820
Step away.

40:09.920 --> 40:12.160
- What's going on?
- Step away, please, sir.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.020
- What's happening?

40:14.120 --> 40:15.500
- There's no council logo on this clamp.

40:15.600 --> 40:17.660
- Er, okay, I'll check it out.

40:17.760 --> 40:19.740
- Did you put this clamp on?
- No.

40:19.840 --> 40:20.660
- [Lana] Who did you speak to?

40:20.760 --> 40:22.820
- Someone from the council.
- Someone you know?

40:22.920 --> 40:23.660
- [Driver] No.

40:23.760 --> 40:25.100
- [Thom] Hey, I need to check to see

40:25.200 --> 40:28.060
if the council ordered a car
removal on Caredale Road.

40:28.160 --> 40:29.160
- [Samira] Step away
from the vehicle, sir.

40:29.240 --> 40:29.980
- [Driver] What's she doing?

40:30.080 --> 40:33.460
- [Samira] Can you step away
from the vehicle, please.

40:33.560 --> 40:37.160
- [Thom] Caredale, Charlie,
Alpha, Romeo, Echo, yeah.

40:38.720 --> 40:41.740
Sir, please move away, I've
asked you, please, thank you.

40:41.840 --> 40:44.200
Officer, please escort this
driver away, thank you.

40:47.040 --> 40:48.900
- There's an open gas
cover under the boot.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.300
- I also need to check on
any gas works in the area.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.140
Council didn't order
any car removal service,

40:53.240 --> 40:53.980
and didn't clamp the car.

40:54.080 --> 40:57.260
- Right, they want this car
moved, this is a set-up.

40:57.360 --> 40:58.260
Shit.
- Central seven four

40:58.360 --> 41:01.340
to all units, we need to
immediately evacuate the area

41:01.440 --> 41:03.100
and set up a 100-meter cordon

41:03.200 --> 41:06.780
around a suspected VBIED on Caredale Road.

41:06.880 --> 41:08.940
- [Dispatcher] Control
received, central seven four.

41:09.040 --> 41:12.040
(suspenseful music)

41:20.840 --> 41:22.840
- You all right?
- Yeah.

41:23.520 --> 41:25.780
- Shall we send in the robot?

41:25.880 --> 41:29.820
- No, John will know that
we're gonna open the boot.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.700
- Here.
- Ta.

41:31.800 --> 41:32.860
- What about the optic cable?

41:32.960 --> 41:34.540
- Yeah, good idea.
- Cool.

41:34.640 --> 41:36.640
Let's suit up, then.

41:46.480 --> 41:48.480
- We good?
- Yeah, good.

41:49.720 --> 41:53.160
(slow suspenseful music)

41:55.160 --> 41:57.160
- Yeah, slowly does it.
- Yeah.

42:19.480 --> 42:20.300
That's a tilt switch.

42:20.400 --> 42:23.040
- Yeah, he wanted us to tow
the car to lift the tilt.

42:24.200 --> 42:26.200
Keep going round.

42:27.760 --> 42:29.760
- [Danny] Trying to see
what it's attached to.

42:33.480 --> 42:35.680
- Bollocks, it's an EFP.
- Shit.

42:36.760 --> 42:41.040
(slow suspenseful music continues)

42:57.680 --> 42:58.780
- [Thom] Danny's told us about the device.

42:58.880 --> 43:01.260
- It's an EFP, an explosively
formed projectile.

43:01.360 --> 43:03.420
- Yeah, and there's no gas work scheduled.

43:03.520 --> 43:04.740
- [Danny] So what are you thinking?

43:04.840 --> 43:06.460
- Well, there's a tilt switch attached,

43:06.560 --> 43:08.580
so when the car is lifted on to the ramp

43:08.680 --> 43:10.540
it sets off the charge,
in this case it's one

43:10.640 --> 43:11.980
that fires a projectile.

43:12.080 --> 43:13.620
So it's strong enough to go
straight through the boot

43:13.720 --> 43:14.820
and into the gas pipes.

43:14.920 --> 43:16.300
- So it's a gas bomb.

43:16.400 --> 43:18.480
Hudson's trying to create
an underground explosion?

43:19.520 --> 43:20.700
- No, because that's not possible.

43:20.800 --> 43:23.780
The gas needs oxygen
to become an explosion.

43:23.880 --> 43:25.700
There's some more complex plan in place.

43:25.800 --> 43:26.940
- Well, the staff at the campaign HQ,

43:27.040 --> 43:28.620
they were told that the
gas pipes were faulty,

43:28.720 --> 43:29.740
filled with water and dirt.

43:29.840 --> 43:31.660
- Sir, we've been door-to-door.

43:31.760 --> 43:33.340
Most of the residents on this street

43:33.440 --> 43:36.060
have had a gas engineer
inside changing the meter.

43:36.160 --> 43:37.900
- Right, okay, so this is gonna be John.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.380
Why's he been in every
house changing the meters?

43:40.480 --> 43:42.380
- Central eight five to control.

43:42.480 --> 43:44.780
We need to evacuate all the
roads surrounding Caredale Road.

43:44.880 --> 43:46.660
Widen the cordon to 500 meters.

43:46.760 --> 43:48.620
Please arrange a bronze evacuation,

43:48.720 --> 43:50.260
this could affect thousands of residents.

43:50.360 --> 43:51.120
- I'll oversee the evacuation.

43:51.200 --> 43:52.340
- I'll get Hamilton to tell the gas board

43:52.440 --> 43:53.200
to turn off the gas on the street.

43:53.280 --> 43:54.460
- Thom, I need EXPO support.

43:54.560 --> 43:55.940
I need to get into all of these buildings

43:56.040 --> 43:57.820
and we need to check all the gas meters.

43:57.920 --> 43:59.780
I'll start with the campaign headquarters.

43:59.880 --> 44:01.020
- Fine.

44:01.120 --> 44:03.120
- [Lana] Let's go.

44:08.120 --> 44:11.840
(suspenseful dramatic music)

44:43.120 --> 44:44.700
Shit.

44:44.800 --> 44:49.400
(suspenseful dramatic music continues)

45:03.440 --> 45:05.440
Tilt switch.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.240
Shit, hang on.

45:16.640 --> 45:18.620
He's gonna release the gas.

45:18.720 --> 45:23.320
(suspenseful dramatic music continues)

45:30.080 --> 45:30.820
This is EXPO two.

45:30.920 --> 45:32.500
It looks like he's set up a gas explosion

45:32.600 --> 45:35.560
in every building on the
street, I need EXPO support now.

45:40.080 --> 45:42.840
(dramatic music)

46:10.200 --> 46:13.200
(soft bright music)
