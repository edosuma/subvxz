WEBVTT

00:38.872 --> 00:40.915
Oh, Hank, you have got
to drive me to school today.

00:40.999 --> 00:41.916
I cannot stop grading.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.296
These are not spelling tests, Hank.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.256
They are what I did
on my winter break essays

00:48.256 --> 00:50.383
and I cannot waste
a single grading minute here.

00:50.508 --> 00:52.343
I am known for my one-day turnaround.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.013
All right, but we got to hurry.

00:55.013 --> 00:56.264
Paint 'n' Paper is having

00:56.264 --> 00:58.224
their 8:00 a.m madness sale.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.770
Okay, trip to Dallas... B...

01:01.770 --> 01:03.730
- Trip to Waco... B...

01:03.730 --> 01:05.899
Trip to New York City... C...

01:06.316 --> 01:07.650
- Trip to...

01:07.817 --> 01:09.027
What the heck?

01:09.027 --> 01:10.570
- Arlen, A.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.113
Ow! My neck is broken!

01:12.238 --> 01:13.782
I'll sue you for everything you have.

01:14.282 --> 01:15.992
Oh, it's Hank Hill.

01:16.242 --> 01:17.077
What's the point?

01:17.077 --> 01:18.870
I have everything you have but better.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.872
Kahn, on this side of the earth

01:20.872 --> 01:22.540
we back out to the right.

01:22.707 --> 01:24.250
Yeah, yeah, just my luck.

01:24.584 --> 01:26.252
I run into uninsured redneck.

01:26.336 --> 01:28.046
Not only am I insured,

01:28.046 --> 01:31.549
I happen to be a member
of the perfect payment club.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.387
Oh, my neck is broken!

01:39.390 --> 01:42.102
Did you have anything
to drink this morning, Mr. Hill?

01:42.102 --> 01:44.896
- No.
- Did you use a mouthwash or cough syrup?

01:45.188 --> 01:47.941
- No.
- Did you eat an unusual amount of sausage?

01:48.149 --> 01:49.651
Look, am I covered or not?

01:49.651 --> 01:52.362
Yes, you're covered, minus the deductible.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.781
And of course, your insurance
rates will go up.

01:54.906 --> 01:58.618
Why should my rates
go up, Ms. Kailiki-Alii?

01:58.785 --> 02:01.037
Well, it's going to cost
us money to fix your truck.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.331
What kind of insurance is that?

02:03.331 --> 02:04.874
Why don't I just take out a loan

02:04.958 --> 02:06.876
fix my truck and avoid the middle man?

02:06.960 --> 02:09.587
You can't drive without insurance.

02:09.671 --> 02:13.049
However, you can avoid the rate
increase if you go to traffic school.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.636
Singles' Traffic School.

02:16.636 --> 02:19.722
Smokers' Traffic School,
Vegetarian Traffic School.

02:20.181 --> 02:22.183
It's like no matter what problem you have

02:22.350 --> 02:23.977
they have a traffic school for it.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.688
Hey, ice cream lovers' traffic school.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.398
I could help you with your homework.

02:28.398 --> 02:32.360
No, no. I don't need any
fancy frills or nonsense.

02:33.027 --> 02:34.737
Here we go, right to the point.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.906
Def-ensive driving school.

02:37.699 --> 02:41.035
Just hope they know more about driving
than they do about spelling.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.795
Hey, what are you doing here, Hank Hill?

02:51.296 --> 02:53.631
Hillbilly traffic school all full up?

02:53.840 --> 02:55.258
Cut the comedy, Kahn.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.135
It was your reckless disregard

02:57.135 --> 02:59.721
of backing-out procedure that put us here.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.556
I want to see you taking notes.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.559
<i>♪ Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo ♪</i>

03:04.559 --> 03:06.102
<i>♪ Booda Sack in the house ♪</i>

03:06.186 --> 03:09.647
<i>♪ Booda Sack in the house ♪</i>

03:11.566 --> 03:15.904
And I want to welcome you all
to def-ensive traffic school.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.990
That's right. Def-ensive traffic school.

03:18.990 --> 03:23.119
I'm def and y'all be 'fensive.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.165
Booda Sack, you crazy.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.875
Kid Mookie, hey.

03:28.875 --> 03:29.959
Yo, check it out.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.836
Look at all the white people
we got up here

03:31.920 --> 03:33.922
in traffic school tonight.

03:33.922 --> 03:36.507
And they say only black people
break the laws.

03:36.591 --> 03:37.508
Ooh!

03:38.635 --> 03:40.053
But that's not true.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.387
Shut up.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.722
Booda Sack on a roll.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.057
Check out, girlfriend.

03:44.182 --> 03:45.767
Got a booty so big

03:45.767 --> 03:48.728
if you put numbers on it
she could press license plates.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.609
Check it out, Booda!

03:54.609 --> 03:57.111
Hey, baby, baby,
baby, ba-a-a-a-by!

03:57.195 --> 03:58.154
Now, after class

03:58.238 --> 04:00.990
you and I got to do a little detention.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.326
You know what I'm sayin'?
Know what I'm sayin'?

04:03.326 --> 04:05.787
This has nothing to do
with defensive driving.

04:06.955 --> 04:10.500
Excuse me, sir. I don't mean
to criticize your lesson plan,

04:10.500 --> 04:12.877
but do you have a lesson plan?

04:14.212 --> 04:16.965
You trying to say that a black man
can't put together a lesson plan?

04:16.965 --> 04:18.299
Well, I got a lesson plan.

04:18.549 --> 04:22.178
I ain't planning on teaching
lessin' you shut up.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.221
Well, hold on now.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.514
I didn't mean to be...

04:24.514 --> 04:26.641
Cracka, are you taking me serious?

04:28.101 --> 04:29.185
I gotcha!

04:30.979 --> 04:34.732
Look, learning good driving skills
is no laughing matter.

04:34.816 --> 04:35.775
<i>♪ Go, cracka! ♪</i>

04:35.775 --> 04:37.485
<i>♪ Go, cracka! Go, cracka! ♪</i>

04:37.485 --> 04:38.903
<i>♪ Go, cracka! ♪</i>

04:38.987 --> 04:39.988
<i>♪ Go, cracka! ♪</i>

04:40.822 --> 04:41.990
Booda Sack?

04:41.990 --> 04:43.241
The Booda Sack?

04:43.700 --> 04:46.035
I saw him on TV three years ago.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.037
On Breakfast at the Apollo.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.206
He was making fun of white people.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.833
Like how we talk funny

04:51.833 --> 04:53.793
- and we don't have any butts.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.546
He's one of the reasons
I want to be a comedian.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.425
Look, there's something
we haven't told you, Bobby.

05:00.591 --> 05:02.135
But maybe now's the time.

05:02.385 --> 05:05.513
You see, show business is inherently evil.

05:05.513 --> 05:09.267
Hank! We agreed not to have
this discussion until Bobby is 15.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.894
I know, but it's time for some tough love.

05:12.186 --> 05:14.355
Bobby, comedians are show-offs.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.232
Sure, they get beautiful women

05:16.316 --> 05:17.775
and drive fast trucks

05:17.859 --> 05:19.986
- But, eventually...
- They have fast trucks?

05:20.528 --> 05:22.155
You're missing the point, son.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.324
Comedy is not a stable career.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.784
I'm going to take you
to that traffic class tonight,

05:26.868 --> 05:29.412
so you can see the lonely, pathetic future

05:29.412 --> 05:30.872
comedy has to offer.

05:31.247 --> 05:32.165
You mean it?

05:32.165 --> 05:33.875
I get to meet Booda Sack?

05:34.375 --> 05:35.501
What am I going to wear?

05:38.296 --> 05:40.923
You know, 'cause white people
be driving like this...

05:41.049 --> 05:43.426
all bent up
over the steering wheel going...

05:43.760 --> 05:47.430
"Oh, dear, I think we've missed our exit."

05:48.056 --> 05:49.390
See what I mean, Bobby?

05:49.474 --> 05:50.975
It's just sad.

05:53.644 --> 05:55.563
Yeah, white people just like that.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.484
Only one thing worse
than white people driving

05:59.609 --> 06:01.486
and that's DWO.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.988
Driving while oriental.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.199
Ooh, cheap shot.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.618
You the man, Booda Sack.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.495
Uh-huh. Know what I'm sayin'?

06:10.703 --> 06:11.954
Bobby, he'll see you.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.831
Hey, Opie Taylor.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.958
Get your butt up here on stage.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.460
Mm-hmm!

06:18.044 --> 06:19.379
Poppin' fresh!

06:20.630 --> 06:23.549
Now, see here, Mr., uh, Sack.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.051
That's my boy and...

06:25.051 --> 06:26.511
Hey, it's all good, baby.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.512
It's all good.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.097
I was just playing with my man here.

06:29.097 --> 06:32.183
Now-now-now, what's
your name, young bru-tha?

06:32.308 --> 06:33.726
Bobby Hill.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.395
Bouncin' Bobby Hill.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.771
Now, tell me, Bobby.

06:37.438 --> 06:39.399
Does your old man drink a lot of beer?

06:39.941 --> 06:40.775
Oh, yeah.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.154
Now, d-d-d-don't lie
now, Bobby.

06:45.613 --> 06:47.657
Does he just stand around all day

06:47.824 --> 06:50.743
drinking beer with all
his other white friends going...

06:51.994 --> 06:53.037
Yeah?

06:53.162 --> 06:55.832
No. They go... Yup.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.585
Sit down, son.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.630
They're not laughing with you.
They're laughing at me.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.006
Now, little blood.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.509
Tell me why you're in the house.
Did you get a ticket

07:06.509 --> 07:09.554
for rubbing your butt too hard
on your banana seat?

07:09.971 --> 07:11.347
My dad brought me here.

07:11.556 --> 07:15.351
He wanted to show me how sad
and lonesome you are underneath.

07:15.726 --> 07:17.061
You right.

07:17.311 --> 07:18.771
You right.

07:19.522 --> 07:20.690
Booda Sack...

07:21.274 --> 07:22.817
is a sad man.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.655
But not as sad as your daddy's sorry self

07:27.655 --> 07:30.658
with his four eyes, too many pies,

07:30.658 --> 07:33.953
super-size, Cracker Jack prize.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.872
Uh, uh, somebody help me. Come on.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.874
And he likes French fries!

07:39.876 --> 07:41.085
Ladies and gentlemen,

07:41.169 --> 07:43.754
this kid is going to be the white rerun.

07:44.964 --> 07:48.050
- Ohh...
- The white rerun, we got him right here.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.222
Hey, Hank, how's driver's ed?

07:54.891 --> 07:57.268
I only... ask 'cause I'm concerned.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.481
I still have one more class
till I'm through.

08:01.731 --> 08:04.650
- Everyone knows you back out to the right.
- Yeah.

08:04.984 --> 08:07.236
- Doesn't take a brain surgeon.
- Common knowledge.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.739
13 years, Dave Hansen lived in that house

08:09.947 --> 08:11.949
never once did he back into me.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.577
Yeah, of course, he was
a 500-pound shut-in.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.996
Mm-hmm. Shame he had to move.

08:17.121 --> 08:19.081
They replaced that wall
pretty nice, though.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.583
Yeah. That looks all right.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.668
- I like the way...
- Matched the paint and everything.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.086
- Yo, yo, yo!

08:24.170 --> 08:26.005
Bobby Hill is in the house!

08:26.130 --> 08:27.131
Uh-huh!

08:27.215 --> 08:28.132
What the...?

08:28.216 --> 08:31.135
Would you look at all the white
people standing around?

08:31.219 --> 08:32.595
Ain't got no butts.

08:32.970 --> 08:36.098
Y'all the no-butt-havingest
people, uh-huh.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.061
And white people always be walking around

08:40.061 --> 08:40.978
like this...

08:41.354 --> 08:44.106
like they be crushing diamonds
in there or something.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.943
Look at me, I'm white.

08:50.988 --> 08:52.740
Y'all peace up. I'm out...

08:55.826 --> 08:57.245
Dang, man.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.872
White people do walk like that, really.

08:59.997 --> 09:01.749
Especially in the army.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.834
Man, that stuff about no butt, man.

09:03.918 --> 09:07.046
I tell you why, you know, why it's
funny, man? 'Cause it dang ol' true.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.340
Look, I appreciate you guys...

09:09.340 --> 09:12.426
...humoring Bobby,
but what the boy needs right now

09:12.510 --> 09:14.887
is to be demoralized into giving this up.

09:14.971 --> 09:17.181
I, I thought he was funny, Hank.

09:17.306 --> 09:19.850
Look at me, I'm white.

09:22.353 --> 09:25.648
Bill, leave the comedy
to the professionals.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.191
Yes, sir.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.115
Booda Sack?

09:34.532 --> 09:35.575
I'm Bobby Hill.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.451
I was in your class the other night

09:37.535 --> 09:39.662
and I saw you on Breakfast at the Apollo.

09:39.662 --> 09:40.955
You saw that?

09:40.955 --> 09:43.749
Yeah, I did some TV a few years back.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.418
Did the L.A thing.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.421
Sit down. Have a bottle of ketchup.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.382
Ketchup.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.926
So how come you're in Arlen?

09:54.051 --> 09:55.511
I mean, you're really good.

09:55.886 --> 09:59.807
I got a little Risque on moesha
a couple of years ago.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.310
It's been hard for me ever since.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.062
Anyway, TV's not where it's at, Bobby.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.274
It's just giving people
the same old stereotypes.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.693
Playing the same old stories.
I didn't want to do that.

10:10.693 --> 10:14.447
What I want to do is
make people laugh and think.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.365
Know what I'm sayin'?

10:16.449 --> 10:19.368
That's why you teach traffic school.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.455
Yeah. That's why I teach traffic school.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.458
Hey, I've been working
on some new stuff. Check it out.

10:25.833 --> 10:29.962
White people think the 'hood
is something on their sweatshirt.

10:30.880 --> 10:31.881
And, um...

10:32.298 --> 10:35.384
How come the cops always
be pulling me over?

10:35.468 --> 10:37.011
What's up with that?

10:37.887 --> 10:42.183
Bobby, let me give you a little piece
of constructive criticism.

10:42.850 --> 10:43.934
You're not black.

10:44.352 --> 10:45.811
Oh. Okay.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.563
I mean, you got to be real, Bobby.

10:47.688 --> 10:48.689
You know what I'm sayin'?

10:48.773 --> 10:49.774
Not really.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.108
You're a white man.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.444
Get in touch with your white roots.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.404
Think of the stuff that's funny

10:55.488 --> 10:56.697
from your point of view.

10:56.864 --> 11:00.201
Well, my dad's got a narrow urethra.

11:01.369 --> 11:02.703
Now, that's funny.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.414
But my dad says comedy isn't a real job.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.084
Comedy ain't about listening to your dad.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.544
You think shucky-ducky got to where he was

11:10.628 --> 11:12.254
by listening to his daddy?

11:12.713 --> 11:15.508
Listen, I got
a dope comedy jam Sunday nights.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.802
Soon as you get real, come on down.

11:17.968 --> 11:19.595
Thanks, Booda Sack.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.313
Dad, Booda Sack says I'm funny

11:29.480 --> 11:31.565
and I can go up on his amateur night.

11:32.024 --> 11:35.319
Son, let me put this in terms
you can understand.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.406
I am not down with that.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.951
What I mean is no.

11:42.910 --> 11:44.787
Booda Sack says I shouldn't listen to you.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.123
He says good comedians are rebels

11:47.123 --> 11:49.291
and they never listen to their dads.

11:49.625 --> 11:53.671
What? Now that guy is trying
to turn my own kid against me?

11:53.838 --> 11:56.048
- You have no manners.

11:56.173 --> 11:59.176
It's obvious that your mother
did not raise you right.

11:59.468 --> 12:00.344
Uh-oh.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.221
What? You talking
about my mother?

12:02.221 --> 12:04.098
Let me tell you about your mother.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.891
Your mother is so fat,

12:05.975 --> 12:08.436
she jumped up in the air and got stuck.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.146
- What?

12:10.479 --> 12:14.483
That's right. I said your
mama is so fat that she freebases ham.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.237
First of all, my mother is not overweight.

12:18.612 --> 12:21.073
She weighs 120 pounds.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.826
Which is perfectly normal
for a woman her age.

12:23.951 --> 12:26.078
I said your mama's so fat,

12:26.245 --> 12:28.164
when she walks around in high heels

12:28.164 --> 12:29.707
she strikes oil.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.461
I don't think you've ever
even met my mother.

12:33.627 --> 12:35.087
If you want to pick on someone

12:35.171 --> 12:37.381
at least have the courage to pick on me.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.716
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

12:38.716 --> 12:41.802
Your urethra is so narrow

12:42.011 --> 12:44.847
sperm be going through there single file.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.224
Sperm two, three, four,
sperm two, three...

12:47.308 --> 12:50.436
Okay, okay. That's it, potty mouth.
I've had enough.

12:50.728 --> 12:53.439
This is supposed to be a classroom.
I'm leaving.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.566
Oh, you leave my class
and I'm going to flunk you.

12:55.566 --> 12:57.318
Yeah, we'll see about that.

12:59.779 --> 13:00.654
Mm-hm.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.740
Mom, you got a minute?

13:03.324 --> 13:04.658
Well, of course, Bobby.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.076
Anything for you, honey.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.371
Now, what is it?

13:09.538 --> 13:11.123
I'm trying to find my roots.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.125
You know, what I'm all about.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.419
Oh, honey, your roots are very rich.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.880
Your grandfather and his father,

13:17.880 --> 13:20.591
and his father's father were all married

13:20.591 --> 13:24.011
and bought houses
and had jobs and had children.

13:25.763 --> 13:27.932
But did they do anything funny?

13:28.182 --> 13:29.767
Oh, Bobby.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.102
Well, honey, it sounds like
you've never heard of

13:32.186 --> 13:34.563
a butter churn with a mind of its own.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.066
Oh, and your great-aunt Charlotte.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.151
We used to call her Mrs. Magoo,

13:39.235 --> 13:40.569
because she couldn't see well.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.405
Oh, and she drank.

13:45.991 --> 13:49.495
And the butter churn
had a mind of its own.

13:52.832 --> 13:53.791
Dang.

13:53.791 --> 13:57.169
Hm, it's kind of funny
in an old person's way.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.296
You're so lucky, Connie.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.339
You're ethnic.

14:00.714 --> 14:03.259
Joseph and I are just... nothing.

14:03.801 --> 14:05.761
We're just white and boring.

14:05.928 --> 14:06.887
Yeah.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.307
Then he said my mother was so big.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.434
Her stretch marks had names.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.395
Well, has he seen your mother?

14:14.395 --> 14:15.312
No.

14:15.396 --> 14:16.438
Is she overweight?

14:16.564 --> 14:17.606
Not by half.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.233
Well, then, that's not funny.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.819
I never did get that Booda Sack.

14:22.152 --> 14:23.988
Tell Mr. Sack I'd like to see him.

14:24.113 --> 14:27.700
And another thing. These videotapes
he's showing are too mild.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.618
I'd like to recommend a movie

14:29.702 --> 14:32.663
I saw in high school called <i>Red asphalt</i>.

14:32.955 --> 14:36.041
Showed a fella's brains
being scraped off the road.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.585
Now, that kept me straight.

14:37.793 --> 14:39.837
I like the way you think, Mr. Hill.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.171
Wassup, boom boom?

14:41.297 --> 14:42.756
I told you not to call me that.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.842
Now, Mr. Hill here has a complaint.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.344
Hey, ain't my fault he don't got a butt.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.679
Tell him to take it up with god.

14:48.679 --> 14:51.265
Now, Booda, we've talked
about this before.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.934
You can't say those types
of things in class.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.437
You're offending people
like Mr. Hill here.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.689
Well, I got something
called freedom of speech.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.608
Ever heard of the first amendment?

15:00.900 --> 15:03.319
Thomas Jefferson's turning over
in his grave right now

15:03.319 --> 15:04.653
and the slave lady's on top.

15:04.737 --> 15:08.282
Now, see here. Thomas Jefferson
was a founding father.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.618
He designed and built his own house.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.036
Now, calm down, you two.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.747
Sack, go put the fancy
candles on the tables.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.040
I'll deal with you later.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.376
I tell you what, Mr. Hill.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.045
He won't teach here again.

15:21.503 --> 15:23.464
Now, I'm not supposed to do this,

15:23.464 --> 15:26.634
but why don't I transfer you
to our chocoholics class.

15:26.634 --> 15:27.927
For the last segment?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.219
Huh? How about that?

15:34.475 --> 15:36.185
If we get on the internet

15:36.435 --> 15:39.688
maybe we could find out
something funny about white people.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.023
Yeah!

15:41.023 --> 15:44.652
Now, we can enter in key words
and then find material for your act.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.612
This is a great idea.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.364
What words should we use?

15:48.781 --> 15:49.990
- White.

15:50.491 --> 15:51.367
Roots.

15:51.659 --> 15:52.785
Funny.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.162
Wow!

16:09.343 --> 16:10.636
You guys busy?

16:10.928 --> 16:12.054
We can take a break.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.683
'Cause if anybody's going downtown

16:15.683 --> 16:18.477
I need a ride to the comedy club
to try out my new material.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.271
Hey, that's funny!

16:21.480 --> 16:22.648
Hey, y'all coming?

16:22.648 --> 16:25.776
No, man, you can count me out o' that,
man. Dang ol' cocktail waitresses...

16:25.776 --> 16:28.278
two of 'em, man. I found out they
were roommates, man.

16:28.445 --> 16:30.614
That dang ol' double boink, man.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.952
What did you do to Booda Sack, Hank?

16:35.244 --> 16:36.745
He was fired!

16:36.954 --> 16:39.164
Now we got to sit through prop comic.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.041
I covered in watermelon!

16:41.417 --> 16:42.876
I feel bad about that,

16:42.960 --> 16:44.712
but the man brought it on himself

16:44.712 --> 16:47.047
with his own locker room mouth.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.384
Boomhauer, where'd everybody go?

16:50.384 --> 16:53.303
Yeah, man, I tell you what, man. Dale,
they took that dang ol' truck, man.

16:53.387 --> 16:56.348
Dang ol' muffler falling off, ain't got
no brakes, man, sparks flyin'.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.601
Like I told him, man. Fix that dang ol'
thing. Put on duct tape, man.

17:00.060 --> 17:02.646
What? They took Bobby to snapz?

17:06.734 --> 17:09.570
Oh! Me! Oh! Fat!

17:09.903 --> 17:12.281
Boom! Now, that's what I call
general haberdashery!

17:15.242 --> 17:19.288
Bobby, do that one. About how the
cops always be pulling you over.

17:19.663 --> 17:22.875
I don't do those kinds of jokes
anymore, Mr. Dauterive.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.126
I got a whole new act.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.712
Pop n' fresh is keepin' it real.

17:27.004 --> 17:29.590
All right, all right,
let's hear it one more time

17:29.590 --> 17:31.800
- for my main man, Toenail!

17:31.884 --> 17:33.594
All right, give him a little dap.

17:33.594 --> 17:34.511
Now, settle down.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.722
We got a special treat
for all of y'all tonight.

17:36.722 --> 17:40.350
The youngest comic
to ever set foot on this stage.

17:40.476 --> 17:43.312
- Give it up for Bobby Hill!

17:45.898 --> 17:47.983
So, how's everybody doing tonight?

17:49.651 --> 17:50.903
All right!

17:52.613 --> 17:55.282
Okay. How many people here

17:55.282 --> 17:56.867
are lucky enough to be members

17:56.867 --> 17:59.328
of the Nordic subgroup of the Aryan race?

17:59.870 --> 18:01.789
Can I see some hands?

18:06.335 --> 18:09.213
Yeah, it's tough
being a white man these days.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.714
It's tough, I'll tell you.

18:10.798 --> 18:13.050
Folks, I'm so white, during the riots.

18:13.050 --> 18:15.010
I went out and bought a television.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.554
What? What? What did he say?

18:18.931 --> 18:20.516
Is this thing on?

18:20.724 --> 18:24.228
- Fake. Get off the stage.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.188
Uh-oh. Bobby's in trouble.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.732
Somebody cut him off, man!

18:30.526 --> 18:33.278
- Dale, where's Bobby? What's going on?

18:33.362 --> 18:35.114
Well, he's no Toenail.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.243
Okay.

18:39.493 --> 18:40.994
Oh! I know!

18:41.078 --> 18:43.080
Here's an old joke
I heard on the internet.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.791
It takes place
in the slavery days of yore.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.168
- What? Bobby, no!

18:48.585 --> 18:49.920
Wait a minute, everybody.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.422
Uh, this is my son up here.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.258
And he's only 12 years old.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.385
Somebody shut that nazi up!

18:56.802 --> 18:58.512
Shut up, you whitey!

18:58.637 --> 19:00.973
Look, he doesn't know what he's saying.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.975
Well, who are you, the grand wizard?

19:02.975 --> 19:04.351
No! No!

19:04.351 --> 19:07.312
- I sell propane and propane accessories.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.439
Yo, yo, yo.
Wh-what's going on here?

19:09.523 --> 19:10.858
Let me get a piece of this.

19:11.108 --> 19:14.778
Whoo! Opie, that new act of yours

19:14.862 --> 19:16.780
is seriously unfunny.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.323
Am I right, y'all?

19:18.407 --> 19:19.700
Yeah, that's right!

19:19.700 --> 19:21.952
You ain't allowed to talk that way.

19:22.077 --> 19:23.203
Not in America.

19:23.287 --> 19:24.329
Am I right, y'all?

19:24.413 --> 19:25.873
- Yeah, that's right!
- That's right!

19:25.873 --> 19:26.999
Wrong!

19:28.667 --> 19:31.086
We got a thing called freedom of speech

19:31.211 --> 19:33.338
and a man on this stage

19:33.422 --> 19:36.133
can say any dumb-ass thing he wants.

19:41.805 --> 19:42.723
Hmm.

19:44.057 --> 19:46.018
And, uh, b-besides,

19:46.518 --> 19:47.978
look at this kid's daddy.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.688
The man don't got no butt at all.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.608
No butt at all. I mean,
his booty's so small

19:52.941 --> 19:54.443
he got to hold onto the light cord

19:54.568 --> 19:55.944
to keep from falling in the toilet.

19:56.153 --> 19:58.113
- He gonna drown, he gonna drown.

19:58.238 --> 19:59.615
Can't swim, can't swim.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.450
I mean, look at this man's booty!

20:01.658 --> 20:02.910
Booty's so small.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.537
He could hula hoop with a cheerio!

20:06.246 --> 20:08.916
- Cheerio! Not foot loop! Cheerio!

20:17.466 --> 20:19.635
I got to thank you, Mr. Sack.

20:19.635 --> 20:22.554
You kept a cool head
in a crisis situation.

20:22.638 --> 20:25.724
Booda Sack, I'm sorry that I wasn't funny.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.226
Well, don't worry about it, Bobby.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.394
You know, rerun didn't
start off that funny.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.355
Well, thanks for saving my boy

20:31.355 --> 20:32.856
and not holding it against me

20:32.940 --> 20:34.900
that you were fired from teachin'.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.860
If you're looking for a real job.

20:36.944 --> 20:39.363
You ought to consider a career in propane.

20:39.655 --> 20:43.283
You know, this whole humor fad
is pretty much on the way out.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.078
Good job, Roger.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.704
You know, I want to apologize

20:47.788 --> 20:49.081
for all those things I said

20:49.081 --> 20:51.458
about your mother, not raising you right.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.627
I'm sure if she had planned for you

20:53.627 --> 20:54.795
it would've been different.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.546
What? What? Don't make
me go upside your...

20:56.630 --> 20:57.881
Gotcha. Just kidding.

20:57.965 --> 21:01.593
Check it out! Drew Carey has finally
developed a sense of humor!

21:01.677 --> 21:03.011
Well, that's alright.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.471
- Hey, Drew Carey,

21:04.471 --> 21:05.847
your mama is so ugly,

21:05.931 --> 21:08.141
when she walks in the bank,
they turn off the camera.

21:09.643 --> 21:14.064
And your mother is so ugly,
uh, it affects her self-esteem.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.818
Your mama got so much hair under her arms

21:17.818 --> 21:19.695
it looks like she got buckwheat
in a headlock.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.656
Well, your mother's hair is so short.

21:22.990 --> 21:25.033
She looks like she's not a woman at all

21:25.117 --> 21:27.536
but more like a man.

21:27.536 --> 21:29.913
More like a man! You got to work
on that one. Check it out.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.874
It's been so long since
your mama's last bath

21:33.041 --> 21:36.420
that her hairy armpits
smell like propane gas!

21:36.420 --> 21:37.838
Now, excuse me.

21:37.838 --> 21:39.006
Hold on there, fella.

21:39.006 --> 21:41.883
A joke's a joke,
but now you've gone too far.

21:42.009 --> 21:43.635
Propane has no natural odor.

21:43.719 --> 21:46.596
What you smell
is actually put there by man

21:46.680 --> 21:48.265
for safety purposes.

21:54.938 --> 21:56.523
Hello. I'm Hank Hill.

21:56.523 --> 21:58.108
And I'm Roger Sack.

21:58.525 --> 22:01.903
Tonight's episode dealt
with racial stereotypes.

22:02.237 --> 22:06.116
Especially the myth that white
people do not have butts.

22:06.116 --> 22:08.660
As you can see from the man
standing next to me.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.245
That's simply not true.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.580
Thank you, Roger.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.582
It's a darn fine butt.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.667
Uh... yeah. Thank you.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.252
That butt is the bomb!

22:17.461 --> 22:22.632
Yeah, uh... I think it's time
for the X-files. Now!

22:23.759 --> 22:24.634
Go!

22:24.718 --> 22:27.054
<i>Whoa! Now that's what I call
general haberdashery!</i>
