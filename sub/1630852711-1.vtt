00:44.041 --> 00:46.125
APPLIANCE SERVICING AND REPAIRS

00:57.791 --> 00:59.041
Get out.

01:00.375 --> 01:01.208
Come on!

01:02.083 --> 01:04.375
- What's happening? Where are we going?
- Over there.

01:04.458 --> 01:05.416
Walk.

01:06.375 --> 01:07.833
Come on. Come on. Keep walking.

01:07.916 --> 01:08.958
Walk!

01:11.250 --> 01:13.458
- Stop right there.

01:14.083 --> 01:15.166
On your knees.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.458
Why, God? Why me?

01:18.541 --> 01:21.583
Why? Because it's your fault
we're in this huge mess.

01:21.666 --> 01:23.958
You and your stupid television show!
It's your fault.

01:24.041 --> 01:24.875
Zip it!

01:24.958 --> 01:28.041
I'm begging you, please. Do what you want
with me, but please don't hurt my mom.

01:28.125 --> 01:29.708
She's got nothing to do with this.

01:29.791 --> 01:32.708
Leave Ester alone too.
She's got nothing to do with it either.

01:33.875 --> 01:37.416
The life I dreamed of with Esther,
that I wanted with her,

01:37.500 --> 01:41.666
that I could-- I could still have,
that I might still be able to maybe--

01:41.750 --> 01:44.166
That's it! I've heard enough.

02:11.750 --> 02:14.208
<i>According to</i>
<i>several eyewitnesses…</i>

02:14.291 --> 02:15.208
FOURTEEN DAYS EARLIER

02:15.291 --> 02:17.750
<i>…Miss Concetta was mugged</i>
<i>after purchasing her weekly groceries</i> .

02:17.833 --> 02:21.666
<i>The robbers stole much of her purchase,</i>
<i>including mini gherkins, pasta,</i>

02:21.750 --> 02:25.083
<i>jarred peaches,</i>
<i>and a cinnamon-infused chocolate bar.</i>

02:25.166 --> 02:29.333
<i>While the sun is sweet here in Sicily,</i>
<i>we are left with the bitter aftertaste</i>

02:29.416 --> 02:31.625
<i>due to this awful criminal activity.</i>

02:32.333 --> 02:35.750
<i>This is just one of the many crimes</i>
<i>in the area over the past few weeks.</i>

02:35.833 --> 02:39.291
Salvo, you fell asleep
in front of the TV again.

02:39.375 --> 02:40.333
Yeah, I fell asleep

02:40.416 --> 02:43.291
right when Inspector Jackson
was arresting the killer.

02:43.375 --> 02:44.875
All these shows are rotting your brain.

02:44.958 --> 02:47.291
You know, you've been sleeping
out here for months.

02:47.375 --> 02:48.708
Wow, I'm really late!

02:49.416 --> 02:50.875
Oh, hey, thank you.

02:51.625 --> 02:52.583
Mm.

02:53.083 --> 02:55.333
What? No sugar! Did I offend you?

02:55.416 --> 02:58.375
Sugar is bad for you.
All the doctors say so now.

02:58.458 --> 03:01.166
- Thank God I'm sweet enough as it is.
- Huh.

03:01.250 --> 03:03.000
Well, good morning, Mama.

03:03.083 --> 03:05.000
Good morning, darling.

03:05.083 --> 03:06.666
- Coffee's ready.
- Mm.

03:07.166 --> 03:09.291
- It's freshly made. Here.
- Thank you.

03:14.541 --> 03:16.000
There's way too much sugar.

03:16.083 --> 03:17.416
- Too much?
- Yeah.

03:17.500 --> 03:19.000
It's like you forgot to add the coffee.

03:19.083 --> 03:21.041
Sugar is good for you.

03:21.125 --> 03:23.375
You need full energy
to face the day ahead.

03:23.458 --> 03:25.875
No, Mom, with this,
I'm gonna need insulin.

03:26.500 --> 03:29.375
<i>Inspector Jackson, I'm excited.</i>

03:29.458 --> 03:32.666
<i>After all this time on the case,</i>
<i>we're finally gonna see the killer's face.</i>

03:32.750 --> 03:34.416
<i>Don't get excited so soon, Sam.</i>

03:36.583 --> 03:38.125
You're gonna be late for work.

03:38.791 --> 03:39.666
Yeah.

03:39.750 --> 03:42.041
<i>Don't forget the killer</i>
<i>was able to escape,</i>

03:42.125 --> 03:45.250
<i>even when we had him surrounded</i>
<i>in that damn room.</i>

03:49.000 --> 03:50.083
Get him, Jackson.

03:51.041 --> 03:54.625
At that moment, the killer
sees four people from the window.

03:54.708 --> 03:58.666
Pay attention, because when it comes
to crimes, the details are very important.

03:58.750 --> 04:04.166
Right at that second, a yellow balloon
floats ominously from the child's hand.

04:04.250 --> 04:06.625
Of course,
because the details are important.

04:06.708 --> 04:07.625
You got it!

04:07.708 --> 04:10.625
You haven't even noticed
that I got my hair done yesterday.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.000
No, I do. You just colored it.

04:13.583 --> 04:16.416
I got a haircut.
It's the same color as always.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.291
- Well, it's not like…
- Come on.

04:18.375 --> 04:20.666
You don't notice anything.
You don't see me.

04:20.750 --> 04:23.041
Oh, come on.
I noticed that you got a new necklace.

04:23.125 --> 04:25.375
- It was an anniversary present from you.

04:25.458 --> 04:26.291
Last year.

04:26.375 --> 04:27.208
Wrong again.

04:28.083 --> 04:28.916
Yeah.

04:32.125 --> 04:35.041
Mama, why did you have to put
ricotta in the cake again?

04:35.125 --> 04:37.500
You have to make that cake with ricotta.

04:37.583 --> 04:40.458
Otherwise, it turns out
lumpy and disgusting.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.833
But you know
I've always been allergic to dairy.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.500
If you never eat dairy,

04:44.583 --> 04:47.000
then you will never get used
to eating dairy.

04:48.625 --> 04:51.333
You're right, Mama.
I'm sorry. You know what?

04:51.416 --> 04:54.291
You just keep adding
ricotta from now on, okay?

04:54.375 --> 04:55.750
Oh, I can use it?

04:55.833 --> 04:58.083
Yes, but also add some Benedryl with it.

04:58.166 --> 05:01.208
That way, I can deal
with the anaphylactic shock more calmly.

05:01.791 --> 05:04.333
Suddenly, the clouds part
and the sun emerges.

05:04.416 --> 05:07.000
Inspector Jackson,
blinded by the glare, is lost.

05:07.083 --> 05:10.083
Tell me about it later.
You're late, and I've got to go to yoga.

05:10.166 --> 05:11.291
Are you not going to work?

05:12.458 --> 05:14.583
You haven't even noticed
that I'm in yoga clothes?

05:14.666 --> 05:16.375
Get outta here! I'll see you at lunch.

05:16.458 --> 05:19.333
So, should I get some sushi,
a sandwich, or something simple?

05:19.416 --> 05:22.166
No, no, no, no,
I'll prepare something healthier.

05:22.250 --> 05:23.291
Hmm.

05:24.083 --> 05:25.375
Not bad. Not bad.

05:25.458 --> 05:27.083
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.

05:27.166 --> 05:29.208
That's your goodbye? And where's my kiss?

05:29.291 --> 05:31.166
- Hmm.
- Oh, come here, love.

05:31.791 --> 05:33.250
- Tell me the truth.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.000
I'm more interesting to you
than your killer, right?

05:36.666 --> 05:38.958
I don't know,
because just as they were arresting him,

05:39.041 --> 05:42.625
I fell asleep and I don't know
what he looks like. Crazy!

05:42.708 --> 05:45.625
After eight seasons
and 132 episodes.

05:46.250 --> 05:49.750
But don't worry. I'm gonna catch up
in streaming.

05:49.833 --> 05:51.583
- Bye, honey.
- Bye, Salvo.

05:51.666 --> 05:53.875
Oh, wait a minute.
Why are you calling me Salvo?

05:53.958 --> 05:55.250
Bye, my tortellini.

05:55.333 --> 05:56.750
Bye, my tortellini.

05:56.833 --> 05:58.666
Bye.

06:04.125 --> 06:06.458
Then the director
of <i>The Touch of the Killer</i>

06:06.541 --> 06:09.083
cuts to none other than inspector Jackson.

06:09.166 --> 06:11.916
Meanwhile,
the killer hides in a dark corner.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.083
And you can't see his face at all.
The inspector is about to arrest him--

06:15.166 --> 06:18.333
Oh my God, you're obsessed with this show.
Totally obsessed.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.333
<i>Once again, in Sicily,</i>
<i>the beauty of the morning</i>

06:21.416 --> 06:23.958
<i>is bombarded with the bitterness of blood.</i>

06:24.625 --> 06:26.833
<i>When the fire department</i>
<i>arrived on the scene,</i>

06:26.916 --> 06:31.250
<i>the innocent kitten was still alive,</i>
<i>trapped inside the car's engine, where…</i>

06:31.333 --> 06:34.166
Hang on. Come on. Let me listen to this.

06:34.250 --> 06:36.083
<i>But once they pried open the hood,</i>

06:36.166 --> 06:40.083
<i>the kitten had experienced a grisly death</i>
<i>at the hands of the fan belt.</i>

06:40.166 --> 06:44.000
Oh my God, between you and him,
I don't really know who's more gruesome.

06:44.083 --> 06:46.458
Well, if you want,
we can talk about your sister's cooking.

06:46.541 --> 06:48.583
You should thank
your lucky stars

06:48.666 --> 06:50.000
my sister puts up with you.

06:50.083 --> 06:51.375
My meals are vegan based,

06:51.458 --> 06:53.875
kale, quinoa, cheese made from chickpeas.

06:53.958 --> 06:56.875
I have no children.
I'm like a panda at risk of extinction.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.791
At least she's feeding you
healthy food, huh.

06:58.875 --> 07:01.625
Oh, you like that. How about you
come over for lunch today then, huh?

07:01.708 --> 07:05.208
No, I can't. If I don't eat
with my mom, she gets offended.

07:05.291 --> 07:07.500
Of course. Your mommy.

07:08.208 --> 07:11.041
What's for lunch today?
Strained carrots? Or maybe some hot dogs?

07:11.125 --> 07:12.625
Why do you always make fun of my mom?

07:12.708 --> 07:15.041
I'm not.
She's the one who doesn't like me.

07:15.125 --> 07:18.416
Just tell me
where our first client is today.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.208
Dante Street. A guy named Alberto Gambino.

08:12.333 --> 08:14.333
- Why are you always whining?
- Whatever.

08:14.416 --> 08:15.333
You've got it all,

08:15.416 --> 08:19.416
a wife who adores you,
tons of friends, and a good job.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.375
I've always dreamed
of a life with adventure.

08:22.458 --> 08:25.791
But instead, what have we got?
A dull routine of a life.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.750
Do you know who's going
to be at our class reunion tonight?

08:30.833 --> 08:32.208
I don't know if Agata's going.

08:32.291 --> 08:35.000
Hold on. What do you mean?
Did I mention Agatha?

08:35.083 --> 08:36.791
You've had a crush on her for years.

08:36.875 --> 08:38.375
Who said I have a crush on her?

08:38.458 --> 08:40.583
Oh, you can see it in your eyes.

08:40.666 --> 08:42.208
What's wrong with my eyes?

08:42.291 --> 08:43.416
- Okay, fine.
- Are you crazy?

08:43.500 --> 08:45.708
Agata is a beautiful girl
like anyone else,

08:45.791 --> 08:48.625
but saying I've got a crush on her
is going way too far.

09:02.625 --> 09:03.458
BE RIGHT BACK

09:03.541 --> 09:05.625
Let's wait
and then ask which apartment it is.

09:05.708 --> 09:07.250
We know which apartment it is.

09:07.333 --> 09:08.625
Come on. Let's just go.

09:08.708 --> 09:11.166
- Come on.
- Salvo, you can't do that. Salvo!

09:26.333 --> 09:28.833
- I'm taking the stairs.
- There's an elevator.

09:28.916 --> 09:32.708
You know I'm not good in small spaces.
I can't breathe. I get anxious.

09:32.791 --> 09:34.916
You know, you never cease to amaze me.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.958
- Go.
- Always something with you.

09:37.041 --> 09:38.291
Always something.

09:39.250 --> 09:40.291
All right.

09:51.416 --> 09:52.916
- Yes?
- <i>Mr. Martorana?</i>

09:53.000 --> 09:53.916
Mrs. Ascalone<i>.</i>

09:54.000 --> 09:56.250
- <i>We have no water.</i>
- I know. I know. I know.

09:56.333 --> 09:57.833
It's being handled right now.

09:57.916 --> 10:01.500
Yes, absolutely. We have them here
and they're working on it now.

10:19.125 --> 10:22.500
Guys, let's hurry it up.
The residents are complaining.

10:22.583 --> 10:24.583
- Yeah, uh…
- Uh…

10:36.958 --> 10:39.000
I'm inside. Come on in.

10:44.916 --> 10:45.958
Hey.

10:46.041 --> 10:47.416
Where's Mr. Gambino?

10:47.916 --> 10:50.041
He's not here.
The door was wide open though.

10:50.125 --> 10:52.333
Okay, so you're trespassing.

10:52.416 --> 10:54.083
Oh, please. We're not criminals.

10:54.166 --> 10:57.791
He probably just left the door open
since he knew we were coming. Calm down.

10:57.875 --> 11:00.916
How would you like it if someone
just walked into your house? Huh?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.500
And who's gonna go to my house?

11:02.583 --> 11:05.166
What are they gonna steal?
Tell me. Quinoa or something?

11:05.250 --> 11:06.833
It's amazing that I go to my house.

11:07.750 --> 11:11.708
Let's find the remote and see what's wrong
with this guy's television, shall we?

11:11.791 --> 11:14.000
Now give me a hand with it, please.
Thank you.

11:14.083 --> 11:16.208
The remote. Let's find the remote.

11:16.291 --> 11:20.083
Always have to do what he says.
Let's find the remote.

11:20.166 --> 11:22.083
So, as I was saying
about the show.

11:22.166 --> 11:26.208
Inspector Jackson doesn't notice
that in the midst of looking for him,

11:26.291 --> 11:29.541
the killer is meticulously
wiring and arming the bomb,

11:29.625 --> 11:30.708
getting everything set up.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.208
So he wasn't scared
the bomb would explode?

11:33.291 --> 11:34.541
The bomb can't explode.

11:34.625 --> 11:35.833
The bomb can explode.

11:35.916 --> 11:36.958
The bomb can't explode.

11:37.041 --> 11:39.625
It's called a bomb, because at some point,
the bomb would explode.

11:39.708 --> 11:41.375
This is a bomb that doesn't explode.

11:41.458 --> 11:43.458
- It can explode, Salvo.
- It can't.

11:43.541 --> 11:45.625
- It can explode.
- It can't explode.

11:45.708 --> 11:48.875
The main character of the show
can't die five minutes into the episode!

11:48.958 --> 11:50.500
- Five minutes, Salvo?
- Yes, five minutes.

11:50.583 --> 11:52.916
You've been trying to tell me
this story since this morning,

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
and that's just the first five minutes?

11:55.125 --> 11:59.208
You keep interrupting me,
and all the details are very important.

11:59.291 --> 12:01.625
Just get to the point!
Tell me who the killer is.

12:01.708 --> 12:03.541
I told you, at 4:00 am,

12:03.625 --> 12:06.208
I fell asleep accidentally
and I didn't watch the ending!

12:06.291 --> 12:09.291
How about you find the killer
and the remote while you're at it?

12:09.375 --> 12:12.333
I don't want to hear anything else
about this. I've had enough.

12:13.291 --> 12:15.500
The killer could be anyone, even the cook.

12:16.541 --> 12:19.625
Mr. Gambino really likes
old, antique stuff. Hello? Hello?

12:20.333 --> 12:22.666
They're not old. They're vintage.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.875
He's a collector.
Don't touch that. Put it down.

12:24.958 --> 12:27.625
Everyone uses the word "vintage" now.

12:27.708 --> 12:29.833
Even if it's something ugly, it's vintage.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.708
The killer could be the football player.

12:32.791 --> 12:35.583
Or maybe even the caretaker. Huh?

12:35.666 --> 12:38.875
Ah, have you seen how fit Mr. Gambino is?

12:38.958 --> 12:42.583
Come on. Just come on.
Don't touch that. Just stop.

12:42.666 --> 12:45.500
- We're TV repairmen. Our hands are filthy.
- Okay, calm down. Okay.

12:45.583 --> 12:47.833
- I'm just looking. But here.

12:47.916 --> 12:49.333
I'll put it back, okay?

12:49.416 --> 12:51.250
Always touching things. God.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.625
Or it could possibly be the masseuse.

13:01.416 --> 13:02.708
Shh, shh, shh. Listen.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.375
You know, it's true what they say.

13:05.458 --> 13:07.666
You really can hear
the ocean in these things.

13:08.166 --> 13:11.291
Yeah, just turn down the volume,
'cause I can hear it from here.

13:18.916 --> 13:22.208
So that's where it is. Found you.

13:24.375 --> 13:26.208
Let's see what's going on.

13:26.833 --> 13:30.000
<i>More clouds are moving in</i>
<i>from the Ionian Sea…</i>

13:32.875 --> 13:36.708
- <i>Strikes at the Strait of Messina…</i>
- It's working fine.

13:36.791 --> 13:37.791
So what's wrong with it?

14:03.416 --> 14:05.041
What did he mess up now?

14:11.250 --> 14:12.791
Wha-- What have you done?

14:12.875 --> 14:16.125
I had nothing to do with this, Salvo.
The gun was on the floor there.

14:16.208 --> 14:18.041
Let's call 911 in case he's still alive.

14:18.125 --> 14:21.083
Alive? He's as dead as a doornail.
You can see that with your eyes closed.

14:21.166 --> 14:23.458
But how could they just murder him
in cold blood like this?

14:23.541 --> 14:25.458
This is no time to get emotional.

14:25.541 --> 14:27.250
What are you, psycho? You're psycho.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.875
You've got a dead body in front of you,

14:28.958 --> 14:30.791
and you're telling me
not to get emotional?

14:30.875 --> 14:32.375
Tell me you didn't touch anything.

14:32.458 --> 14:34.333
- Wait. Why?
- The gun, did you touch it or what?

14:34.416 --> 14:36.500
Yes, I touched it
'cause I really didn't think that I…

14:36.583 --> 14:39.500
The police will love that. You touched it
'cause you didn't bother to think?

14:39.583 --> 14:42.125
Yeah, but I'm not the one who shot him.
You see that, don't you?

14:42.208 --> 14:44.791
I didn't see anything.
I wasn't at the scene of the crime.

14:44.875 --> 14:46.333
Yeah, but you can still testify.

14:46.416 --> 14:49.458
I can't testify!
You're my brother-in-law! I can't testify!

14:49.541 --> 14:51.958
All the more reason
we should be calling the police right now.

14:52.041 --> 14:54.000
So they can pin it on you
with a residue test.

14:54.083 --> 14:55.958
- Hmm?
- Residue. Residue!

14:56.041 --> 14:57.875
You've got gunpowder residue
on your hands.

14:57.958 --> 15:00.333
- I'll go and wash them.
- Wash them? Just stop touching things.

15:00.416 --> 15:01.416
Good God, okay?

15:01.500 --> 15:04.458
Gunpowder residue stays
on your hands for 72 hours.

15:04.541 --> 15:06.458
How the hell
do you know about all this stuff?

15:06.541 --> 15:08.166
Because of <i>The Touch of the Killer.</i>

15:08.250 --> 15:10.750
God, Salvo. Cut it out
with <i>The Touch of the Killer </i>shit.

15:10.833 --> 15:13.625
- There's nothing I can do.
- Stop doing things then.

15:13.708 --> 15:15.833
Trust me. You've already done enough!

15:15.916 --> 15:17.416
I need time to think.

15:18.208 --> 15:19.791
- So, we have a dead body.
- Eh.

15:19.875 --> 15:20.916
And we have the gun.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.791
And your prints are on the gun.
I told you before not to touch things.

15:24.875 --> 15:27.041
Especially not guns
in other people's houses.

15:28.208 --> 15:31.041
Inspector Jackson
would put you away for 20 years, minimum.

15:31.125 --> 15:33.083
But we're in Italy,
so it'll be more like 10 years.

15:33.166 --> 15:36.000
Salvo, this is not the plot of one
of your stupid little television shows.

15:36.083 --> 15:38.541
- Yeah, well, I guess not.
- Do you get that? This is real life.

15:38.625 --> 15:40.416
Yes, in real life, there are no motives.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.458
What reason did you have to kill him?

15:42.541 --> 15:45.291
Huh? You need to understand
I didn't kill this guy.

15:45.375 --> 15:47.708
Don't you get it? I'm not the one
who needs to understand.

15:47.791 --> 15:50.375
It's the judges who need to understand.

15:50.458 --> 15:53.416
Do you know how many innocent idiots
are in jail right now

15:53.500 --> 15:55.333
due to injustice
and inconsistent evidence?

15:55.416 --> 15:57.375
- Does that happen? Really?
- Of course!

15:57.458 --> 16:01.083
In <i>The Touch of the Killer,</i>
a poor guy spent 18 episodes in prison.

16:01.166 --> 16:03.375
They let him finish the show
out of kindness.

16:03.458 --> 16:05.791
I desperately don't want
to go to jail, Salvo.

16:05.875 --> 16:08.125
If only you knew
how small the cells are in prison.

16:08.208 --> 16:10.583
It's three square feet for 18 people.

16:10.666 --> 16:13.791
Thick bars, a tiny little hole
as a skylight for you to look through.

16:13.875 --> 16:15.666
- I'm gonna have a panic attack, Salvo.
- I know.

16:15.750 --> 16:18.208
You know I can't handle
being in confined spaces.

16:18.291 --> 16:21.041
Of course, because you've
run out of things to touch.

16:23.916 --> 16:26.875
Now tell me this.
Did anyone see you when you came up?

16:26.958 --> 16:29.041
- No.
- You're sure no one saw you, right?

16:29.125 --> 16:31.916
- No.
- Well, then maybe we were never here.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
In what sense, though?

16:33.083 --> 16:35.583
I've seen the killer do the same thing
on <i>The Touch of the Killer.</i>

16:35.666 --> 16:37.416
Oh, just shut up
with <i>The Touch of the Killer.</i>

16:37.500 --> 16:40.958
If we were never here, would either of us
have known about this dead guy?

16:41.041 --> 16:43.375
No, but unfortunately for us,
we actually are here.

16:43.458 --> 16:45.875
Yes, but if we cover our tracks
and clean everything,

16:45.958 --> 16:47.708
it'll be like we were never here.

16:47.791 --> 16:50.541
Don't you get it?
And you won't go to jail either.

16:50.625 --> 16:52.583
God, I really do not want to go to jail.

16:52.666 --> 16:54.583
Look, we're not doing anything wrong.

16:54.666 --> 16:56.458
We just need to clean things up.

16:56.541 --> 17:00.666
We'll make it look like the last ten
minutes we were here never even happened.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.750
And this will be just a bad dream.

18:04.583 --> 18:08.333
Hey. What are you doing in here?
Come on. Let's get out of here. Let's go.

18:08.416 --> 18:09.958
Who do you think killed him?

18:10.500 --> 18:13.416
How would I know who killed him?
It could be anyone.

18:13.500 --> 18:14.750
His wife.

18:14.833 --> 18:15.750
His brother.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.166
- His brother?
- His brother, yeah.

18:17.250 --> 18:19.583
Sometimes people kill for the inheritance.

18:19.666 --> 18:20.833
It's been proven now

18:20.916 --> 18:23.791
that most murders
are committed by close relatives.

18:23.875 --> 18:24.708
Mm.

18:24.791 --> 18:27.083
- Okay, come on. Let's go.
- And the running water?

18:27.166 --> 18:29.041
- The-- The water? The water?!
- I mean--

18:29.125 --> 18:31.125
You really don't know
anything about thrillers!

18:31.208 --> 18:33.416
You think the killer came in here,
shot him,

18:33.500 --> 18:35.750
and then said,
"Better make sure I don't waste water"?

18:35.833 --> 18:37.750
You think Greta Thunberg killed him?

18:37.833 --> 18:39.000
- Come on. We're going.
- Hmm.

18:44.583 --> 18:46.416
Doesn't matter. Come on. Let's go.

18:48.125 --> 18:49.166
Okay.

18:50.916 --> 18:52.333
Let's get out of here.

18:52.958 --> 18:56.041
- Go. Come on. Let's go.
- I have to get out of this place.

18:56.125 --> 18:57.208
Let's go.

19:07.166 --> 19:08.458
Mr. Gambino?

19:09.125 --> 19:11.583
It's Martorana, the doorman.
Are you there?

19:11.666 --> 19:14.333
I'm here with two handymen from a company

19:14.416 --> 19:16.833
who are fixing
the plumbing in the building.

19:16.916 --> 19:18.416
They're here to do some repairs

19:18.500 --> 19:21.916
on the floor outside your door.
Here in the hallway as well.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.708
- Mr. Gambino?

19:24.666 --> 19:26.083
Mr. Gambino?

19:26.750 --> 19:28.083
Uh, he's not there.

19:28.166 --> 19:32.833
Uh, thank you very much for coming
on such short notice,

19:32.916 --> 19:35.750
because if we wait
for the residents' committee…

19:35.833 --> 19:38.083
Uh, please be quick, though,

19:38.166 --> 19:41.958
because in this building, they're
just waiting for any excuse to complain.

19:42.041 --> 19:44.041
- Thank you.
- Don't worry. We won't take long.

19:44.125 --> 19:44.958
Come on.

19:45.041 --> 19:46.416
What are we gonna do?

19:46.500 --> 19:48.583
What do you think?
We have to wait here now.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.541
Pinuccio, I'm not saying you have to work,
but could you at least sing?

20:04.125 --> 20:05.458
- I'm exhausted.

20:05.541 --> 20:09.250
This morning I finished
watching <i>The Touch of the Killer.</i>

20:10.958 --> 20:13.125
Are you still talking
about that TV show, Pinuccio?

20:13.208 --> 20:15.375
- You know who was the killer?
- No.

20:15.458 --> 20:16.583
The gardener.

20:16.666 --> 20:18.166
No! No!

20:18.833 --> 20:21.250
- Shh!

20:23.625 --> 20:24.625
Shh!

20:27.166 --> 20:28.958
- Did you hear that?
- What?

20:29.041 --> 20:30.000
The TV.

20:30.083 --> 20:31.875
- Huh?
- It turned on, then off again.

20:31.958 --> 20:33.166
- Huh?
- Someone's home.

20:33.250 --> 20:34.875
Well, then maybe it was the gardener.

20:34.958 --> 20:40.208
- What is wrong with you?
- Eight seasons, 132 episodes.

20:40.291 --> 20:42.291
Zip it! Zip it!

20:42.375 --> 20:44.750
- You're crazy. You're crazy.

20:44.833 --> 20:45.750
Be quiet!

20:45.833 --> 20:50.541
But the gardener was just the hired gun,
and the mastermind behind it all was Sam.

20:50.625 --> 20:54.333
- Inspector Jackson's best friend.
- No! No, not that too! Don't spoil!

20:55.166 --> 20:58.833
No, don't you dare
make a sound. Don't you dare make a sound.

20:58.916 --> 21:00.375
Don't you dare make a sound.

21:02.375 --> 21:03.625
Did you hear that?

21:03.708 --> 21:04.541
It's a cell phone.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.416
No, don't answer it. You can't answer.

21:09.041 --> 21:10.416
Someone's home.

21:12.041 --> 21:13.291
Mr. Gambino?

21:14.250 --> 21:15.583
Mr. Gambino?

21:17.166 --> 21:18.458
Mr. Gambino?

21:18.541 --> 21:20.583
Pinuccio, you're making
a big deal out of nothing.

21:20.666 --> 21:24.166
This Mr. Gambino must've left
his cell phone at home. That's all.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.625
Call your mother back
or else she'll get suspicious.

21:35.708 --> 21:37.416
But don't tell her where you are, okay?

21:37.500 --> 21:38.666
What should I tell her then?

21:38.750 --> 21:41.958
Tell her anything else besides
that you're at an active crime scene.

21:42.041 --> 21:43.958
Just get away from the door. Go!

21:54.125 --> 21:55.875
- <i>Darling!</i>
- Hey, Mama.

21:55.958 --> 21:57.500
I just wanted to check in.

21:57.583 --> 22:01.333
How does a nice juicy rare steak
for lunch sound to you?

22:01.416 --> 22:02.875
- Uh…
- <i>Huh?</i>

22:05.333 --> 22:06.625
Uh, no, thanks, Mama.

22:06.708 --> 22:08.166
I won't be home for lunch today.

22:08.250 --> 22:10.541
Don't worry. I'll just grab
a salad from somewhere, okay?

22:10.625 --> 22:12.125
A salad?

22:12.208 --> 22:14.500
You've become worse than your sister.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.250
Why aren't you coming home for lunch?

22:16.833 --> 22:18.375
Does this have to do with Salvo?

22:18.458 --> 22:22.125
No, it's just that we're
at a job far from town.

22:22.208 --> 22:23.541
And you didn't tell me?

22:23.625 --> 22:26.208
I didn't tell you
because it was a last-minute thing.

22:26.291 --> 22:27.375
Oh.

22:27.458 --> 22:29.291
And where are you?

22:32.916 --> 22:34.541
Uh, Castelmonte.

22:35.291 --> 22:36.625
Way out there?

22:36.708 --> 22:38.166
Castelmonte, way out there.

22:38.250 --> 22:41.375
You don't think they have appliances
that need fixing way out here?

22:41.458 --> 22:43.750
What in the world is going on with you?

22:44.333 --> 22:47.125
Okay, Mama. I have to go, Mama.
Okay. Bye. Bye.

22:47.208 --> 22:48.125
Bye.

22:51.416 --> 22:52.750
- Sorry.
- You finished?

22:52.833 --> 22:53.666
Sorry…

22:53.750 --> 22:55.208
Shut up. Shut up.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.166
Go and sit down. Go and sit down.

22:57.250 --> 22:58.625
- Sit down now.
- She just--

22:58.708 --> 22:59.666
Sit!

23:00.875 --> 23:02.333
- Did you silence your phone?
- Yes.

23:02.416 --> 23:03.375
No sounds!

23:04.541 --> 23:05.625
Stop moving!

23:11.833 --> 23:14.416
That's the theme song
for<i> The Touch of the Killer</i> .

23:14.500 --> 23:15.416
Oh!

23:23.958 --> 23:25.208
Hey, Ester. How are you?

23:28.791 --> 23:32.250
Sorry I didn't get to the phone in time,
but anyway, what's going on with you?

23:32.333 --> 23:34.458
Mama told me
you're not coming home for lunch

23:34.541 --> 23:37.166
because you're going
to Castelmonte. Is that really true?

23:39.291 --> 23:42.666
Yes, my love. Castelmonte.
We're already on our way out there.

23:42.750 --> 23:44.250
And you couldn't let me know?

23:44.333 --> 23:46.791
I went to the market this morning
so I could make lunch for you.

23:46.875 --> 23:48.041
I didn't ask you to do that.

23:48.125 --> 23:50.416
And I already prepared everything for you.

23:50.500 --> 23:51.708
What did you cook for me?

23:51.791 --> 23:54.750
Kale soup with sunchoke root and rocket.

23:54.833 --> 23:55.666
Hmm.

23:56.291 --> 23:58.708
Don't worry, love.
I will eat it all tomorrow.

23:59.291 --> 24:00.958
But it's best when it's hot.

24:01.041 --> 24:03.333
I know, but I like it cold. Ice cold.

24:03.416 --> 24:05.750
That way it numbs my mouth,
and I can't taste it anymore.

24:08.833 --> 24:09.708
Who's that?

24:09.791 --> 24:11.625
Who do you think it is? It's your brother.

24:11.708 --> 24:12.541
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

24:13.125 --> 24:14.125
Bye, Salvo.

24:14.208 --> 24:15.916
Hey, why did you call me Salvo?

24:17.375 --> 24:19.208
Bye, tortellini.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.291
<i>Bye, tortellini. Bye.</i>

24:22.708 --> 24:25.791
What were you thinking telling your mother
we're going to Castelmonte?

24:25.875 --> 24:28.041
You told me to say
that we were far away from here.

24:28.125 --> 24:30.583
Yes, but why Castelmonte?
What? It's really far away.

24:30.666 --> 24:32.625
Because it was
the first town I thought of.

24:32.708 --> 24:34.625
Ah, at least you stuck to Sicily, huh?

24:34.708 --> 24:38.625
Oh, it's your fault I'm in this situation.
I'm the one who wanted to call the police.

24:38.708 --> 24:41.000
Do you not get that I'm saving your life?

24:41.083 --> 24:43.333
- They'd send you straight to prison.
- Eh.

24:43.416 --> 24:47.583
How is Mommy gonna bring lunch
to your little prison cell then, huh?

24:47.666 --> 24:49.791
Don't you dare talk
about my mama like that.

24:49.875 --> 24:52.875
- You've always had a problem with her.
- Oh, I'll call her Mommy all I want to.

24:52.958 --> 24:55.916
- I'm the only one that can call her that!

24:56.000 --> 24:57.208
Oh, crap.

24:58.083 --> 25:01.000
<i>Hi, you've reached Alberto.</i>
<i>I can't answer right now,</i>

25:01.083 --> 25:03.375
<i>but please leave a message after the tone.</i>

25:06.583 --> 25:08.333
<i>Hi, Alberto.</i>

25:08.416 --> 25:09.708
<i>It's Ester.</i>

25:11.000 --> 25:14.958
<i>I know I was the one who canceled,</i>
<i>but I've changed my mind.</i>

25:15.041 --> 25:17.708
<i>I just found out my husband</i>
<i>is going to Castelmonte</i>

25:17.791 --> 25:19.750
<i>and won't be back until tonight.</i>

25:19.833 --> 25:23.000
<i>So, wait for me,</i>
<i>because I will be with you soon.</i>

25:23.083 --> 25:25.166
<i>See you soon, my </i>tortellone<i>.</i>

25:25.875 --> 25:29.416
If he's the <i>tortellone</i> ,
then the other guy is just a cuck.

25:36.291 --> 25:38.166
Ah! I'll kill him!

25:38.250 --> 25:41.625
Snap out of it, Salvo.
Who are you going to kill? The man's dead.

25:41.708 --> 25:44.875
- He's dead!
- She called him "<i>tortellone</i> ," Valentino.

25:44.958 --> 25:47.083
She calls me "tortellini."

25:47.166 --> 25:48.875
What's he got that I don't?

25:48.958 --> 25:51.708
- Don't get me started, Salvo.

25:51.791 --> 25:56.000
That's why she asked who I was with
and why I wasn't coming home for lunch!

25:56.083 --> 25:59.416
She wasn't being jealous or upset.
She was planning!

25:59.500 --> 26:01.875
Come on, man.
You can't cry, Salvo. Please.

26:01.958 --> 26:03.875
You know that tears contain DNA.

26:03.958 --> 26:05.666
Otherwise, why did we bother cleaning?

26:05.750 --> 26:08.250
We got a different problem now.
You've got a motive.

26:08.333 --> 26:11.458
The police will think
you're the one who killed Gambino!

26:11.541 --> 26:12.708
Oh no!
