WEBVTT

00:08.300 --> 00:11.770
What? Holy moly.
It's beautiful!

00:11.803 --> 00:15.474
Once, I stood
on this very same balcony
with my mother and had--

00:15.507 --> 00:18.177
Whoa! Is that a seagull
but also a bug?

00:18.210 --> 00:19.979
Almost the same reaction.

00:20.012 --> 00:26.051
I am a descendant of a long line
of newts who made a sacred vow
to care for this land.

00:26.085 --> 00:32.557
The trees, the plants,
the animals--
All are under our care.

00:32.591 --> 00:35.494
Lady Olivia,
you newts took me in
when I landed here.

00:35.527 --> 00:37.562
Fixed me up, cared for me.

00:37.596 --> 00:41.166
I promise to do my best
and look after this place
as well!

00:41.200 --> 00:43.268
We'll be counting on you,
Master Marcy.

00:58.583 --> 01:02.021
Lady Olivia,
you have been summoned
by the King.

01:07.026 --> 01:10.095
Oh, hey.
The King summoned you too?
Do you know what this is about?

01:10.129 --> 01:13.565
No, and it's been weeks
since the Plantars
and Anne disappeared.

01:13.598 --> 01:15.600
And we haven't heard a peep
from him since.

01:15.634 --> 01:17.569
I wonder what's keeping him.

01:19.972 --> 01:23.342
Please, my lord.
Things are progressing
as fast as they--

01:23.375 --> 01:27.279
Yes, I know, but the device
hasn't even been tested.

01:27.312 --> 01:30.115
Surely we should try it
on someone else first?

01:30.715 --> 01:33.252
As you wish.

01:34.786 --> 01:36.788
Well, that was freaky.

01:37.889 --> 01:41.760
Ah! You two. Come in, come in.

01:42.661 --> 01:45.197
Good news! You're both promoted.

01:45.230 --> 01:48.267
Olivia, you will now oversee
the construction
of our refineries.

01:48.300 --> 01:53.138
It's time to sap
this pitiful mud bowl
of all its remaining resources.

01:53.172 --> 01:57.042
And Yunan,
we're gonna need frogs
to work in these factories,

01:57.076 --> 01:58.777
so go round up some villagers.

01:58.810 --> 02:00.645
And if anyone resists...

02:02.014 --> 02:03.648
...give them a stern talking to.

02:03.682 --> 02:05.217
Oh.
Not too bad.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.919
Just kidding! Terminate them!

02:07.953 --> 02:10.689
All right now, get to it!
I have business to attend to.

02:13.625 --> 02:16.128
That does it!

02:16.161 --> 02:18.563
I made a sacred vow
to protect this land,

02:18.597 --> 02:22.267
and I cannot continue to
stand idly by while King Andrias
destroys it.

02:22.301 --> 02:24.103
Lady Olivia.

02:24.136 --> 02:26.138
If you're going to
talk treason...

02:28.707 --> 02:30.909
I insist
that you do it in private!

02:32.211 --> 02:34.079
You're dang right
he's gone too far.

02:34.113 --> 02:37.983
And based on whatever
we just witnessed,
Andrias is losing it.

02:38.017 --> 02:40.685
I for one,
will not serve a mad king.

02:40.719 --> 02:43.122
Agreed. But we can't
take him down alone.

02:43.155 --> 02:45.757
We need someone clever,
someone who understands
strategy,

02:45.790 --> 02:48.127
someone like Marcy Wu.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.162
The human?
Absolutely not.

02:50.195 --> 02:52.597
In case you haven't noticed,
they're all scheming
backstabbers.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.099
I trust Marcy.

02:54.133 --> 02:57.302
Besides she's the only one
who's ever defeated King Andrias
in flipwart.

02:57.336 --> 02:59.604
If anyone can outthink him,
it's her.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.973
I'm plenty smart!

03:02.807 --> 03:04.209
Whoa! Did you see that?

03:04.243 --> 03:06.545
I nearly took my head off.

03:06.578 --> 03:09.181
Okay, maybe we do need Marcy.
Glad to hear it.

03:09.214 --> 03:12.551
But she's being held
under the castle.
No one is allowed down there.

03:12.584 --> 03:15.954
There's even
a rumor she's being guarded
by a horrible monster.

03:15.987 --> 03:19.291
A monster? Don't tell me
the great General Yunan

03:19.324 --> 03:21.326
is scared
of some ridiculous rumors.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.128
I see what you're doing.

03:23.162 --> 03:25.430
And it's working.
Lead the way, milady.

03:28.167 --> 03:30.235
We'll never get past them.

03:30.269 --> 03:31.636
Well,
not with that attitude we won't.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.072
What?

03:40.445 --> 03:44.283
- And that's how it's done.
- Will you put me down already?

03:50.755 --> 03:54.426
Ooh, ominous.
After you, milady.

03:56.228 --> 03:57.396
Yoink!

03:59.264 --> 04:02.767
- Remember--
- I know, I know.
Get the human and get out.

04:02.801 --> 04:04.936
She better be worth it.

04:04.969 --> 04:06.205
Whoa.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.174
You knew this was down here?

04:09.208 --> 04:12.377
Sort of.
Even I was strictly forbidden
to come here.

04:12.411 --> 04:15.114
But I did sneak down a few times
as a girl.

04:16.248 --> 04:17.549
What the--

04:17.582 --> 04:19.718
Don't worry! It's harmless.

04:25.624 --> 04:27.692
Take it.
It's a friendship offering.

04:27.726 --> 04:31.062
Oh. Why, thank you. I think.

04:38.603 --> 04:42.073
More kooky creatures?
What is this place?

04:42.107 --> 04:46.077
I think it's where our ancestors
kept all their otherworldly
prisoners.

04:46.111 --> 04:48.147
Delightful.

04:51.683 --> 04:52.684
This is it.

04:54.319 --> 04:55.587
No going back now.

04:58.323 --> 05:00.159
There she is!

05:11.303 --> 05:13.672
Sashy? Anne?

05:13.705 --> 05:15.274
She's out of it.

05:15.307 --> 05:16.908
Wake up, human!

05:16.941 --> 05:18.109
Wake up, I say!

05:18.143 --> 05:20.912
Yunan! Gentle!
Be gentle!

05:20.945 --> 05:23.515
Marcy, it's Olivia
and General Yunan.

05:23.548 --> 05:25.650
There's no time to explain,
we have to get out of here!

05:25.684 --> 05:31.223
Okey dokey.
Lead the way, Lady Olivia.
Captain Yoo-hoo.

05:32.691 --> 05:33.892
I'm okay.

05:45.670 --> 05:47.339
What the heck is going on?

05:49.808 --> 05:51.343
What in newt's name...

05:51.376 --> 05:53.778
Whoa.
We're outside already?

05:53.812 --> 05:55.647
It can't be...

05:58.049 --> 05:59.184
Mother?

05:59.218 --> 06:00.685
Is that you?

06:00.719 --> 06:05.490
Olivia. The sky! The trees!
How could you let this happen?

06:05.524 --> 06:08.560
I'm sorry, Mother.
I did everything I could.

06:08.593 --> 06:09.594
Well...

06:11.029 --> 06:14.199
it wasn't enough!

06:16.067 --> 06:17.969
What is this witchcraft?

06:18.002 --> 06:19.338
What?

06:22.106 --> 06:25.510
Oh.
It's a projection.

06:25.544 --> 06:27.812
You know, like, uh, VR.

06:27.846 --> 06:29.180
Vvvvrrrr?

06:29.214 --> 06:31.850
It's not real,
you goof.

06:32.517 --> 06:33.985
The room's changing again!

06:34.018 --> 06:35.487
Just try not to freak out!

06:35.520 --> 06:40.325
Oh, please.
Nothing scares
the great General Yunan!

06:40.359 --> 06:43.228
Scourge of the Sand Wars!
Defeater of...

06:43.262 --> 06:44.663
Oh, no.

06:44.696 --> 06:47.065
What? It's just a cute, little--

06:47.098 --> 06:48.933
Grubhog!

06:50.369 --> 06:52.337
You're afraid
of this little cutie?

06:52.371 --> 06:54.273
I had a bad experience, okay?

06:54.306 --> 06:58.109
When I was a little girl,
one of those monsters
nearly took my arm off.

07:02.614 --> 07:05.116
No. No. No!

07:05.149 --> 07:08.287
- Wait, come back! It's not real!
It's--

07:08.320 --> 07:11.055
Whoa. Whoa!

07:11.089 --> 07:13.325
Oh, no. Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no.

07:14.759 --> 07:18.630
How could you, Mar Mar?
You betrayed us.

07:18.663 --> 07:23.101
No! I know what I did
was super dumb. I'm so sorry.

07:23.134 --> 07:29.073
It's too late.
We want nothing to do with you.
Ever again.

07:29.107 --> 07:30.642
No. Please.

07:30.675 --> 07:33.111
- Stay back! Stay--

07:34.479 --> 07:36.080
- Back?

07:36.114 --> 07:39.150
These eyes.

07:39.183 --> 07:41.219
These eyes are making
the nightmare, guys!

07:41.252 --> 07:42.787
Eyes?

07:42.821 --> 07:45.290
That must be where all of these
things are being projected from!

07:45.324 --> 07:47.926
Guys, take out the eyes!

07:47.959 --> 07:48.993
Right!

07:49.027 --> 07:51.730
You'll pay
for using my mother's likeness!

07:58.970 --> 08:00.439
What the--

08:07.812 --> 08:10.782
Woo! Here's the last one!

08:12.183 --> 08:15.086
Marcy! Here! Catch!

08:15.119 --> 08:16.821
That's what I'm talkin' about.

08:25.397 --> 08:27.098
Woo-hoo!
We did it!

08:28.500 --> 08:31.536
I'm not normally one
for teamwork,

08:31.570 --> 08:35.440
but, uh,
good job out there everyone!
Very nice hustle!

08:35.474 --> 08:36.808
You goof.

08:36.841 --> 08:40.979
We make a good team, huh?
Now let's get out of here!

08:41.012 --> 08:42.781
Sorry.
I might need help.

08:42.814 --> 08:44.983
All right,
up and at 'em. Here we go--

08:46.385 --> 08:50.154
Leaving so soon?
But we have so much to discuss.

08:50.188 --> 08:54.659
But how did you...
Simple. We've been watching you
the whole time.

09:03.067 --> 09:04.268
What the heck is that?

09:07.906 --> 09:08.907
Marcy!

09:10.041 --> 09:13.144
Behold!
Our ultimate creation.

09:13.177 --> 09:18.683
A collection of Amphibia's
greatest minds, preserved
for all eternity.

09:18.717 --> 09:21.319
What are you doing, Andrias?
Stop it, you maniac!

09:21.352 --> 09:24.489
Studying the Mossman
improved our medical technology,

09:24.523 --> 09:29.994
But it wasn't until we met
the Shadowfish that we truly
learned to conquer death,

09:30.028 --> 09:33.097
and thus, the core was born.

09:33.131 --> 09:35.233
[grunts, strains] Let me go!

09:35.266 --> 09:38.603
I wish I could.
But my lord craves a host.

09:38.637 --> 09:41.105
And it wanted the best,
the smartest.

09:41.139 --> 09:43.274
The only one who could beat me
at flipwart.

09:44.543 --> 09:47.846
Honestly, Marcy? I like you.
Always have.

09:47.879 --> 09:51.650
I begged the core to consider
an alternative host, but alas.

09:53.485 --> 09:55.487
What? What is this? Huh?

10:00.058 --> 10:01.426
Marcy!
No!

10:18.276 --> 10:19.143
The time has finally come

10:19.177 --> 10:21.212
for the core to lead us
to our destiny.

10:21.245 --> 10:23.247
But what destiny you ask?

10:23.281 --> 10:27.786
Well, I suppose
I should just let it speak
for itself.

10:34.125 --> 10:35.794
Why, hello there.
