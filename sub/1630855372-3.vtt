WEBVTT

00:28.278 --> 00:29.446
Come here, Son.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.284
It's six o'clock in the morning.

00:34.284 --> 00:38.247
- What are you doing up?
- I wanted to get ready. Just like you.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.878
We can't go out into the world
like everybody else.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.631
You wanna be taken seriously as a man?

00:48.757 --> 00:50.676
Never let them see you in anything less

00:50.676 --> 00:53.846
than a suit and tie on
with not a wrinkle in place.

00:53.846 --> 00:55.222
Shoes shined.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.100
No one can claim they're your betters

00:58.100 --> 01:01.061
if your style and sophistication
shine through.

01:01.979 --> 01:08.819
We must present nothing less
than our best selves. Do you see?

01:11.864 --> 01:14.658
I have to go.
Another thing we can't be is late.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.745
- Go Mustangs.
- Good game.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.707
- Thank you. Have a good night, all right?
- Yeah. Bye.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.585
- Sir.
- That was a hell of a win tonight.

01:25.127 --> 01:27.045
I appreciate it. Good night, now.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.883
Congratulations, Emory.
Impressive opening game.

01:30.883 --> 01:33.135
I think we can speak for the whole board

01:33.135 --> 01:35.804
and say we're looking forward to seeing
what the rest of the season

01:35.804 --> 01:38.599
and our fastidious AD have in store.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.309
Nothing less than a national championship.

01:41.351 --> 01:46.940
Show our pride the Cedar Cove way.
The kids, wow, they deserve all the kudos.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.193
And that new coach, something else.

01:50.194 --> 01:51.195
Indeed.

01:52.070 --> 01:53.655
- Good night, Evelyn.
- Good night.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.657
- Joseph.
- See you at the next game, Emory.

01:55.657 --> 01:56.742
Absolutely.

01:57.993 --> 02:01.246
Dr. Lawson,
that was quite the show tonight.

02:01.246 --> 02:05.167
Krista. Yes, you could call it that.
What can I do for you?

02:05.167 --> 02:08.252
I'm working on a big story,
and I need to talk to you about it now.

02:08.252 --> 02:09.922
Now? Why is that?

02:09.922 --> 02:11.965
Something's about to drop in 12 hours.

02:11.965 --> 02:15.302
My editor's really bugging me about
highlighting how Cedar Cove athletics

02:15.302 --> 02:18.055
is going to generate tons of headlines
this season.

02:18.055 --> 02:21.433
- Time to take a little credit.
- The athletes deserve all the credit.

02:21.433 --> 02:25.938
Agreed. In fact, they may deserve
a lot more credit than you think.

02:26.897 --> 02:27.981
Fifteen minutes.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.567
I'm sorry, I have
a previous commitment tonight.

02:30.567 --> 02:33.987
Tomorrow then? Give me the morning
so I can make my deadline.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.532
Text me the details. I'll be there.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.951
- All right.
- Great.

02:38.951 --> 02:40.118
Good night.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.873
Coach, the game ball is for you.

02:44.873 --> 02:47.501
Ain't no way you're not official
after that W.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.753
To the most valuable new member
of our team.

02:56.802 --> 02:59.847
- Speech, speech, speech.
- Speech, speech, speech.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.891
Hey. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

03:03.600 --> 03:09.773
Man, for some of you guys,
this season is your last hurrah as a team.

03:09.773 --> 03:13.902
Before we know it, you'll be off
to college and doing your own thing.

03:15.070 --> 03:18.365
So let's go out with a bang.
This is a hell of a way to set it off.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.534
Man, I-- I-I love y'all, man.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.289
All right, all right, all right.
Listen, listen, listen, listen.

03:25.289 --> 03:28.041
I know you all got big plans
with the birthday boy.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.962
Excuse me. The birthday man.

03:32.963 --> 03:35.465
Now that you are officially an adult,

03:35.465 --> 03:38.886
I won't even ask what made you decide
to go out wearing that.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.930
What, you get dressed in the dark?
That shirt full of holes.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.140
What's wrong with you?

03:46.810 --> 03:49.396
Y'all just jealous 'cause
I can pull this off.

03:51.315 --> 03:52.774
I don't know about that.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.986
Anyway, anyway.
Coach, you swinging through?

03:55.986 --> 03:59.114
I'ma be a little late to the party.
I got something I gotta do real quick.

03:59.114 --> 04:02.868
But just in case I miss y'all,
I'ma leave you with a friendly reminder.

04:04.328 --> 04:05.329
If you will.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.916
Our next game is a road trip to New York.

04:08.916 --> 04:14.296
So, we gotta get ready, put in that work.
Bus leaves tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.

04:14.296 --> 04:15.547
What?

04:15.547 --> 04:17.632
Enjoy the win tonight. Have your fun.

04:18.466 --> 04:21.386
But be responsible, fellas. All right?

04:22.387 --> 04:24.181
- Got you.
- All right.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.850
We can go right now.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.690
Yo, yo, yo, what's popping?
What's popping?

04:33.690 --> 04:36.235
- Everybody's got the love.
- Thank you. It's all love, it's all love.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.696
Thank you.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.741
Yeah. Say-- Say cheese.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.618
Say cheese.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.578
- Can I have your autograph?
- Yeah, no problem.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.622
You did so good today.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.873
Thank you.

04:50.707 --> 04:51.708
Thank you.

05:08.350 --> 05:11.728
Yo, come on, man. We haven't got all day.
You know we gotta party.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.438
Hey. All right. For real.

05:13.438 --> 05:16.733
Hey, yo, sophomore.
You rolling to the party with us?

05:18.735 --> 05:20.195
I mean, if you got the room.

05:20.195 --> 05:22.573
Boy, you better get ready
for them older girls.

05:22.573 --> 05:24.700
- You better watch it.
- Come here, boy.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.159
Hey, hey.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.703
My car is full.

05:27.703 --> 05:30.372
I'm taking some ladies
from the Latinx club.

05:30.372 --> 05:31.999
- No worries.
- All right then.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.750
- I'll catch y'all.
- That's a bet.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.253
- Come on, sophomore.
- Hey, man, we good. Let's roll.

05:36.253 --> 05:39.006
- We outta here, man.
- All right. We out, gang.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.604
It's the worst time for Nick
to be injured.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.941
And he's taking it in stride, <i>pero</i> me,
I'm a mess.

05:58.942 --> 06:02.571
- What are the doctors saying?
- They're telling him to be patient.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.156
Good luck with that.

06:04.156 --> 06:07.034
Exactly. When the lower back pain stops,

06:07.034 --> 06:08.452
then he'll return to practice,

06:08.452 --> 06:10.495
but with limitations.
You know, restrictions.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.289
He'll be back at it in no time.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.499
I hope you're right.

06:15.459 --> 06:16.293
Hey.

06:19.588 --> 06:23.884
Birthday boy. <i>Feliz cumplea√±os,</i> Jace.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.594
Thank you, Miss Mendez.

06:27.346 --> 06:28.639
<i>Te ves guapo.</i>

06:29.765 --> 06:31.183
That means ugly, bro.

06:31.183 --> 06:32.476
- Hey.
- Guap-- <i>Guapo</i>?

06:32.476 --> 06:34.978
- Handsome. Let's go.
- Oh, thank you.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.022
We're gonna see you later, no? Ciao, ciao.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.649
- Okay.
- Hey.

06:38.649 --> 06:41.485
So, how many parents supposed to be
at Royale's house later?

06:41.485 --> 06:43.195
Like you said this morning,

06:43.195 --> 06:45.280
- we're only gonna stay until 10:00.
- All right.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.865
We may even leave before you do.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.492
Good. Especially you.

06:48.492 --> 06:51.036
- I have a present for you.
- I'm just kidding.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.039
- What's happening, Jackie?
- Hey, Drew.

06:55.707 --> 06:57.626
You look nice. You smell nice.

06:57.626 --> 07:00.587
Mom, this is my grown-man era.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.464
Happy birthday, young man.

07:03.882 --> 07:04.883
What's all this?

07:06.677 --> 07:08.303
- Wasn't ready for that.
- You ain't making any babies.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.097
Didn't we talk about this already?

07:10.097 --> 07:14.643
We talked about this when you were a kid.
Like you said, you smelling like a man.

07:16.395 --> 07:17.855
I don't even wan--

07:17.855 --> 07:20.440
- Should I be afraid of what's inside?
- Open it.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.448
This was your grandfather's,
and if he were still alive,

07:28.448 --> 07:30.367
he would want you to have this.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.911
"Son, it's your time, stay in the moment."

07:34.538 --> 07:35.539
Ma.

07:39.543 --> 07:42.379
Thank you, Mom, for everything
you've done for us.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.090
And I promise you,

07:45.090 --> 07:47.593
one day, I'ma give you back
as good as you gave me.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.345
You don't have to do anything.

07:50.345 --> 07:53.640
That's my job, to make sure you become
who you're meant to be.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.814
You'll still always be the guy
who leaves the toilet seat up.

08:00.814 --> 08:04.985
- Shut up. I love you, Sis.
- I love you. Happy birthday, man.

08:07.529 --> 08:08.697
All right.

08:08.697 --> 08:10.449
- Later, Mommy.
- Bye.

08:10.449 --> 08:12.993
- Are y'all ready?
- You know what time it is, boys.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.204
Damn your slow ass.

08:16.538 --> 08:17.915
- Hey.
- Come on, y'all.

08:17.915 --> 08:19.166
We don't got all day, Phil.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.085
You're a sight for sore eyes.
Haven't seen you...

08:22.085 --> 08:25.047
Since you moved.
I still have your housewarming gift.

08:25.047 --> 08:26.089
From a year ago?

08:27.883 --> 08:29.760
You should come and visit us sometime.

08:31.261 --> 08:34.765
Bro. How can you listen
to that and not listen--

08:36.308 --> 08:40.187
You know there's a party at Royale's.
You're coming, right?

10:23.332 --> 10:25.083
Yo.

10:28.545 --> 10:29.588
Oh, my Lord.

10:30.547 --> 10:34.259
Yo, Royale, he living
the Black bougie life times a mil.

10:34.259 --> 10:35.385
For real.

10:35.385 --> 10:36.970
- Facts, bro.
- What about you, CJ?

10:36.970 --> 10:38.347
You living like this too?

10:38.347 --> 10:41.183
Kind of, but it's in a white neighborhood.

10:41.183 --> 10:43.185
Boy,
you about to get some culture right now.

10:43.185 --> 10:44.520
That's right.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.633
Right on time.

11:15.384 --> 11:18.512
And is that a three-piece tracksuit?

11:19.388 --> 11:23.725
I'm passing up on a big interview
Krista Cooke wants to do on me tonight

11:23.725 --> 11:24.810
to ball out with you.

11:26.103 --> 11:27.896
Well, it'll be good to get a sweat on.

11:29.857 --> 11:32.067
How often do you get a run in these days?

11:32.693 --> 11:36.196
Between the baby, the job,
those damn night classes slowing me down,

11:36.196 --> 11:38.907
I get in when I can. What about you?

11:38.907 --> 11:42.494
Between work and my
ten-year-old's recitals, I do what I can.

11:43.912 --> 11:47.457
Well, I still got some fire left in me.

11:47.457 --> 11:48.834
I hear that.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.545
Talia, ball!

11:56.133 --> 11:59.219
- Let's go!
- It's like that?

11:59.219 --> 12:00.637
Lucky shot.

12:00.637 --> 12:03.640
All right, let's make it interesting.
First to 11 wins.

12:04.349 --> 12:07.853
If I win, you gotta go a whole week
without wearing a tie.

12:08.395 --> 12:13.025
I'm talking Billy Dee Williams,
two buttons open, chest hair showing.

12:17.613 --> 12:19.698
All right. And if I win,

12:19.698 --> 12:24.328
you're sporting a tie and crisp shirt,
even at practices and a game.

12:26.121 --> 12:29.625
All right, bet. I got Derek and Talia.

12:30.918 --> 12:31.793
Come on in.

12:31.793 --> 12:32.878
- Emory.
- Steve.

12:32.878 --> 12:33.837
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.923
Yeah. Let's get it.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.133
That guy here. Who you got?

12:39.551 --> 12:40.761
Ball up.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.804
All right, guys, play nice.

12:48.352 --> 12:50.354
What up, man? How you doing?

12:54.983 --> 12:57.402
Yo, yo. What's happening?

12:59.321 --> 13:01.281
Man, what's good?

13:01.281 --> 13:02.908
- Hey!
- Yo! Yo, my boy.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.535
- This is huge, man.
- You know.

13:04.535 --> 13:06.787
- Thank you, bro. Respect.
- I got you. I got--

13:06.787 --> 13:09.081
- Good to see you, bro.
- Yo, 21 Savage.

13:09.081 --> 13:10.624
Sup, my man?

13:10.624 --> 13:13.335
Hold on.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.134
Want you to show me something.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.052
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:22.052 --> 13:23.762
Hey, hey, hey.

13:31.687 --> 13:35.232
Hey, y'all.
Hey, keep it going, keep it going.

13:35.232 --> 13:37.401
Check it out. It's the birthday king.

13:37.401 --> 13:39.111
What's going on? Hey, can you hook it up?

13:39.111 --> 13:41.071
Kings can request anything
on their day, man.

13:41.071 --> 13:42.072
All right.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.577
Can you play something old?

13:47.494 --> 13:48.495
I got you.

13:58.130 --> 14:00.757
There we go.
That's what I'm talking about.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.135
Are you playing with me?

14:03.135 --> 14:05.345
Come on, Ma, get up on over here!

14:05.345 --> 14:07.973
You trying to embarrass me?

14:10.267 --> 14:11.727
Hey, hey. Come on. Hey.

14:11.727 --> 14:13.896
Come on, Ma! What!

14:13.896 --> 14:16.315
- Go Jenna, go Jenna, go Jenna.
- Go Jenna, go Jenna, go Jenna.

14:16.315 --> 14:18.066
What!

14:22.112 --> 14:23.739
It's my son's birthday.

14:23.739 --> 14:26.116
- My son's birthday, my son's birthday.
- Hey, hey, hey.

14:26.116 --> 14:28.952
- My son's birthday, my son's birthday.
- All right. All right.

14:28.952 --> 14:31.538
- All right. All right, come on. Let's--
- Hey, hey, hey.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.124
I'm just getting started.

14:39.213 --> 14:43.634
Oh, my God. All right, Ma.
That's enough already.

14:43.634 --> 14:47.179
Let's go.
Go on back to the old people corner now.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.058
Wow.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.560
Yo, Jace. We gotta talk.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.695
- I'll be right back. All right.
- I got you.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.216
What's going on, Crys?

15:26.260 --> 15:27.928
You know that reporter Krista Cooke?

15:28.512 --> 15:32.015
Yeah, she called me the best player
out the DMV in the last ten years.

15:32.015 --> 15:35.727
Yeah, she also said someone knows
who beat up Coach Warrick.

15:54.538 --> 15:56.582
It sounds like she just fishing.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.335
Even if that was the case...

16:03.005 --> 16:05.799
we do not need this shit right now.

16:05.799 --> 16:09.094
If this came out
I don't know if my scholarship

16:09.094 --> 16:11.722
at the University of Maryland
will still stand.

16:11.722 --> 16:14.933
I'm on the short list
for McDonald's All-American.

16:15.559 --> 16:17.227
I'm up for McDonald's too.

16:17.227 --> 16:20.355
Jace, this is not a good look
for either of us.

16:27.196 --> 16:29.364
Crystal, even though we not together

16:29.364 --> 16:34.077
I don't think anyone can get
to us unless we let them.

16:34.077 --> 16:36.163
Who else was with you that night?

16:37.497 --> 16:40.334
I'm not gonna talk about something
that happened four years ago.

16:40.334 --> 16:44.087
So what? That's it?

16:44.087 --> 16:46.840
That's your solution, staying quiet?

16:47.633 --> 16:49.760
Yes, it is.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.520
Hawking. Okay, okay.

17:00.145 --> 17:01.146
Hawking.

17:04.608 --> 17:06.484
- Get your hand off me.
- Hey...

17:06.484 --> 17:08.654
No ticky-tack calls, everybody!

17:08.654 --> 17:10.364
Right here. Right here.

17:11.949 --> 17:12.950
Money.

17:14.660 --> 17:15.827
No, don't touch it.

17:15.827 --> 17:16.994
Wet hand. Don't touch.

17:17.913 --> 17:18.789
You got it.

17:19.665 --> 17:21.165
Let's go!

17:21.165 --> 17:24.670
It's a tough loss for you.
I'm not gonna do the petty thing

17:24.670 --> 17:27.714
and brag about how your designer ties
are gonna be on pause.

17:28.674 --> 17:30.801
It sounds to me like you just did.

17:30.801 --> 17:32.970
How about a rematch? Best of three.

17:32.970 --> 17:37.766
If I win, you wear a blazer in addition
to the tie and crisp shirt.

17:37.766 --> 17:40.394
- A lot of swagger in a good suit now, Ike.
- Yeah.

17:42.688 --> 17:44.064
I'm down to run it back.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.275
What about y'all?

17:46.275 --> 17:48.318
Nah, man. I gotta go.

17:48.318 --> 17:49.736
Date night with the wife.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.572
- Okay. All right.
- Yeah, I'm out.

17:51.572 --> 17:53.407
That's fine. We'll run twos then.

17:53.407 --> 17:54.616
Let's go. I'm good.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.702
I'm down.

17:56.702 --> 17:58.704
Here we go. Oh, yeah.

17:59.580 --> 18:02.583
Okay, I got a badass, cool-looking mama,

18:02.583 --> 18:04.501
and the only time a man knocks on her door

18:04.501 --> 18:06.378
is when they're delivering
for UPS and FedEx.

18:06.378 --> 18:08.881
- Scuse me?
- Just look.

18:09.840 --> 18:13.051
Okay. This is the profile I made for you.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.262
I wrote your bio
and selected the pictures.

18:16.430 --> 18:19.224
"I am looking for someone who exercises,

18:19.892 --> 18:21.226
- is employed...
- Yeah.

18:21.226 --> 18:23.812
...and is ready
for stimulating conversation."

18:25.022 --> 18:26.315
When did you write this?

18:26.315 --> 18:28.609
Are you kidding?
I've been writing this for years.

18:29.193 --> 18:30.986
Mom, just trust me, okay?

18:31.612 --> 18:33.572
I do like the photos you picked.

18:34.156 --> 18:37.492
The minute this goes up on Match,
you can go out tonight, if you want.

18:37.492 --> 18:39.286
That's a bit fast.

18:39.286 --> 18:42.247
When's the last time
you've done something for yourself?

18:50.380 --> 18:52.299
Let's keep it between us girls.

19:05.395 --> 19:06.730
Let's go get the cake.

19:07.397 --> 19:08.398
Okay.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.451
- It's not gonna work.
- Yo, I got you.

19:20.035 --> 19:22.579
Okay, this is straight
from my playa's handbook.

19:22.579 --> 19:25.123
- What player's handbook?
- No, no, not player.

19:25.624 --> 19:29.378
Playa. All right?
Listen, man, you lo-- You look great.

19:30.045 --> 19:31.046
Let's go.

19:31.839 --> 19:34.758
Drea. Hey, Drea, what's up?

19:34.758 --> 19:36.885
- Hey. How y'all doing? You good?
- Hey.

19:37.845 --> 19:41.139
You know, Drew's been trying to get you
on <i>The Keys to the Kingdom</i>, right?

19:41.723 --> 19:44.017
- What's that?
- A podcast.

19:44.017 --> 19:47.396
Oh, yeah? So what are we discussing?

19:48.063 --> 19:49.523
Cheerleading.

19:49.523 --> 19:52.693
And feminism.
And how the two go hand in hand.

19:55.487 --> 19:58.448
So, why me?

20:01.410 --> 20:02.494
Okay, you know what?

20:02.494 --> 20:04.663
- I'm gonna go get some drinks, all right?
- Oh, God.

20:04.663 --> 20:05.789
You-- Y'all thirsty?

20:05.789 --> 20:07.666
All right. Come on.

20:07.666 --> 20:08.709
Don't wait for me.

20:08.709 --> 20:11.044
- All right, I'll see you later.
- I won't.

20:13.046 --> 20:16.341
Well, I can tell there's more autonomy

20:16.341 --> 20:18.677
in your decision to cheer
than you get credit for.

20:19.887 --> 20:21.263
The world needs to hear that.

20:22.681 --> 20:24.641
That sounds like bullshit.

20:27.394 --> 20:28.645
But I'll do your show.

20:31.356 --> 20:32.357
Okay.

20:39.990 --> 20:42.743
Eighteen. He made it. You both did.

20:43.452 --> 20:45.704
Thanks.
'Cause you know there was some days.

20:46.330 --> 20:48.165
Okay. Cake.

20:49.166 --> 20:50.584
Get your hands off of me.

20:51.585 --> 20:54.004
- Hey, hey.
- You good?

20:54.004 --> 20:57.299
- Pick it up. Shooter.
- Nah.

20:57.299 --> 20:59.009
- Right there.
- Get back.

20:59.009 --> 21:01.553
Talk to me. Talk to me. Talk to me.

21:02.888 --> 21:03.889
There it is.

21:06.683 --> 21:08.352
- Nice one.
- Law of averages, Ike.

21:09.144 --> 21:11.647
Tough twos you hit
in the first game didn't fall this time.

21:11.647 --> 21:13.607
Need me to find you a tailor?

21:13.607 --> 21:16.276
I know a good one who can fit
suits for you in a few days.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.028
So the petty shit goes both ways?

21:18.028 --> 21:20.864
Well, if you can sling it,
you should be able to take it too.

21:21.657 --> 21:23.617
- It's cool.
- Tiebreaker?

21:23.617 --> 21:24.826
For sure.

21:24.826 --> 21:26.328
I got an early day tomorrow.

21:27.788 --> 21:29.122
My knees aren't what they used to be.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.582
- At all.
- I bet.

21:30.582 --> 21:31.542
At all.

21:32.042 --> 21:36.046
- We're not keeping you, are we, brother?
- Yeah, but I got nowhere to be.

21:37.172 --> 21:38.173
All right.

21:42.344 --> 21:45.764
Let's get to the truth of it.
You don't like me.

21:46.265 --> 21:47.850
You think I'm an unrefined,

21:47.850 --> 21:51.270
unintelligent brother who's not worthy
enough to carry your jockstrap.

21:51.270 --> 21:55.440
And I think you are an arrogant,
nose-in-the-air brother

21:55.440 --> 22:01.321
who thinks his PhD gives him license to
claim he's a part of the talented tenth.

22:01.905 --> 22:03.740
And you're suggesting I'm not?

22:03.740 --> 22:08.036
I'm saying you're not.
So let's play for something real.

22:08.996 --> 22:11.206
No blazers, no ties.

22:12.541 --> 22:16.461
If I win, I am no longer interim coach

22:17.171 --> 22:20.007
and you get the hell off my back
for the rest of the season.

22:26.180 --> 22:27.014
Deal.

22:28.265 --> 22:29.099
Check.

22:41.195 --> 22:45.866
Okay. Come on.
Come on. Come in. There you go.

22:46.658 --> 22:48.869
Three, two, one.

22:48.869 --> 22:53.707
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

22:54.208 --> 22:58.337
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

22:59.004 --> 23:04.259
<i>Happy birthday, dear Jace</i>

23:04.760 --> 23:09.431
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

23:18.273 --> 23:19.942
Make a wish, Jace.

23:42.506 --> 23:46.552
Happy birthday! Yes!

23:47.511 --> 23:49.972
So, what's up
with this curriculum committee?

23:50.472 --> 23:52.641
Girl, I wish I had an update.

23:52.641 --> 23:57.479
We assembled a committee and a game plan,
but it fell on deaf ears.

23:57.479 --> 24:01.692
Are you serious? Mr. Toole is such a jerk.

24:03.777 --> 24:05.904
You having trouble
with one of your teachers?

24:05.904 --> 24:09.324
So, all semester,
the first three readings we had,

24:09.324 --> 24:11.660
we studied two books and a poetry series.

24:11.660 --> 24:13.370
But other than Langston Hughes,

24:13.370 --> 24:15.956
there has been no people of color
in anything we're doing.

24:18.876 --> 24:21.295
Well, I've dealt with my fair share
of jerks too.

24:21.295 --> 24:23.839
But don't let him, or whoever it is,
steal your shine.

24:23.839 --> 24:28.677
- You're Coach Edwards's wife, right?
- Yes, I am Coach Edwards's wife.

24:28.677 --> 24:31.763
But I'm also gonna be your diversity,
equity and inclusion adviser.

24:32.264 --> 24:34.224
And we are gonna set up an appointment
about this

24:34.224 --> 24:37.311
- and sort out these issues.
- Wow, that means so much coming from you.

24:37.311 --> 24:39.938
I'm sure Coach Edwards is dealing
with his own battles at Cedar Cove,

24:39.938 --> 24:42.774
- so I know you get it.
- Yes, I do.

24:42.774 --> 24:44.735
- You ladies enjoy your night, okay?
- You too.

24:44.735 --> 24:46.528
- Thank you so much.
- Okay, thank you.

24:46.528 --> 24:49.239
- That was sweet of her.
- Yeah. Oh, my gosh.

24:53.994 --> 24:56.788
Uh-oh. Is Jace ready to get lost
in the Amber sauce?

24:58.207 --> 24:59.583
We've got to get you over there.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.795
I'm thinking about heading home.

25:04.713 --> 25:07.007
- Yo. Everyone is expecting you.
- What?

25:07.007 --> 25:08.550
She got her dad to go all out.

25:08.550 --> 25:09.801
You can't go home.

25:13.597 --> 25:14.723
All right.

25:15.516 --> 25:17.434
- Have you heard of it?
- Yeah.

25:17.434 --> 25:19.520
Hey. Let's roll.

25:22.773 --> 25:26.902
Actually, I'm good. I'm gonna stay here.

25:27.694 --> 25:30.697
But if I need a ride home,
I'll let you know.

25:30.697 --> 25:33.325
- All right.
- All right, bro. All right, bro.

25:34.451 --> 25:35.911
- Hey.
- Huh?

25:35.911 --> 25:39.289
Yo, you know I can't leave
the party I'm hosting at my own house.

25:39.790 --> 25:42.709
- Y'all understand that, right?
- All right, I'll get with you later.

25:43.210 --> 25:44.545
Happy birthday, bro.

25:44.545 --> 25:47.422
Thank you, bro.
Appreciate you, man. All right.

25:49.883 --> 25:52.386
Yo, you all right?

25:53.303 --> 25:55.013
Yeah, I'm just tired.

25:56.056 --> 25:57.975
Damn. Old man, tired already.

25:59.434 --> 26:00.811
All right, come on. Let's hurry up.

26:13.323 --> 26:15.325
Come on in here. Go on in here.

26:15.325 --> 26:16.952
Yep. Uh-huh.

26:18.912 --> 26:19.997
Yeah! That's off you.

26:20.581 --> 26:22.416
- Yeah, baby!
- Foul.

26:22.416 --> 26:25.627
Come on, man!
You calling that ticky-tack bullshit?

26:25.627 --> 26:28.547
No blood, no foul, man.
I barely touched you.

26:28.547 --> 26:31.216
You were all over me.
Some would call a flagrant.

26:31.216 --> 26:32.467
Some would call it bullshit.

26:32.467 --> 26:34.678
You know what's bullshit,
is you mugging my ass,

26:34.678 --> 26:35.888
acting like it's defense.

26:35.888 --> 26:38.390
Now you're not speaking
the King's English?

26:38.390 --> 26:40.893
You wanna see me from the gutter?

26:42.019 --> 26:44.980
I can be from the MFin' gutter.

26:47.858 --> 26:51.653
Okay, Doc. Calm that down.

26:52.446 --> 26:56.116
Well... what you think, brother?

26:56.825 --> 26:58.368
There was contact.

27:00.329 --> 27:01.330
Fine.

27:02.831 --> 27:03.999
We can take it back.

27:05.417 --> 27:06.502
Check.

27:13.133 --> 27:16.094
- Uh-uh. Let's go.
- Okay, let's play then. Let's play.

27:16.094 --> 27:20.432
- Okay. Let's do it then.
- Uh-huh. Hey.

27:20.432 --> 27:21.642
Hey!

27:25.270 --> 27:26.855
That's not a foul?

27:27.439 --> 27:29.107
Not if you don't call it.

27:33.362 --> 27:37.115
Damn! I'ma take it like a man.

27:39.201 --> 27:41.620
- Good game.
- You too, Ike.

28:00.931 --> 28:02.975
<i>It's eleven o'clock, on the dot
I'm on the block</i>

28:02.975 --> 28:05.727
<i>Ain't no time for no sleepin' or yawnin'
Or whatnot</i>

28:05.727 --> 28:07.563
<i>Twelve running around creepin'
And peepin' for the drop</i>

28:07.563 --> 28:10.357
<i>We be moving with caution
The block is really hot</i>

28:10.357 --> 28:12.276
<i>The block is hot, the block is hot</i>

28:12.943 --> 28:16.572
<i>The block is hot, the block is hot</i>

28:16.572 --> 28:18.782
<i>The block is hot, the block--</i>

28:18.782 --> 28:21.451
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:21.451 --> 28:24.371
- Hey, Jace Carson, what's up?
- What up, man?

28:24.371 --> 28:25.956
Happy b-day, bro.

28:29.501 --> 28:32.838
Matter of fact, I need everybody
to put your phones in the air right now.

28:32.838 --> 28:35.007
Phones up. Phones up.

28:35.007 --> 28:36.675
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up.

28:36.675 --> 28:38.802
Hey, Jace. This one's for you.

28:41.305 --> 28:43.682
One, two, three, let's go...

28:45.851 --> 28:47.603
- I'll be right back.
- Aight.

28:54.484 --> 28:59.656
Hot! Hot! Hot!

29:07.080 --> 29:08.624
Yo. What the hell?

29:09.750 --> 29:12.669
- Dude, stop.
- That's my girl.

29:12.669 --> 29:17.174
- I'm not your girl.
- Yo, we got a problem?

29:18.550 --> 29:19.551
You tell me.

29:20.093 --> 29:22.471
You don't back the hell up,
it's about to get real.

29:23.639 --> 29:24.890
Yo, come on, man, chill.

29:26.141 --> 29:27.559
Y'all go on ahead, we good.

29:43.158 --> 29:46.537
You got D1, college,
all this shit going for you.

29:46.537 --> 29:48.705
We can't be getting caught up
in no dumb shit.

29:49.373 --> 29:51.083
We gotta be smarter than that.

30:00.592 --> 30:03.053
I thought I'd have to send out
a search party for you.

30:04.930 --> 30:05.931
Do you want a drink?

30:08.058 --> 30:09.059
I'm good.

30:10.227 --> 30:11.645
Thanks for doing all this.

30:13.522 --> 30:14.690
Do you wanna go meet IDK?

30:16.817 --> 30:18.777
Nah, I'm kinda tired.

30:19.278 --> 30:21.488
We have to travel
to New York tomorrow morning.

30:23.991 --> 30:25.075
I should head home.

30:26.326 --> 30:27.661
My parents aren't even here.

30:28.495 --> 30:29.496
We can go up to my room.

30:31.081 --> 30:32.207
I can't right now.

30:37.296 --> 30:38.297
Picture at least?

30:42.009 --> 30:43.010
Sure.

31:28.222 --> 31:29.223
I need a refill.

31:36.772 --> 31:39.149
- That was insane, man.
- Yeah, bro. What about you, boy?

31:39.149 --> 31:41.109
W-What about you and Amber? I saw that.

31:42.402 --> 31:43.445
Yeah.

31:43.445 --> 31:45.280
- That boy always getting busy.
- Almost there.

31:45.280 --> 31:46.698
- Breathe.
- Nah, bro. You good.

31:46.698 --> 31:49.952
- No, no, no, no!
- No, no, no, no, no!

31:54.915 --> 31:58.502
- Are you good, boy?
- This is my mom's car, bro.

31:58.502 --> 31:59.837
All right.

31:59.837 --> 32:00.921
Wow.

32:05.425 --> 32:06.927
Hey, hey. Turn the music down.

32:27.781 --> 32:28.615
We got you.

32:29.783 --> 32:31.952
Watch his head. Watch his-- Okay.

32:32.744 --> 32:34.371
- Come on, CJ.
- Come on, man.

32:34.371 --> 32:36.957
- Come on, CJ.
- We got you, we got you.

32:36.957 --> 32:39.501
We got you. Come on.

32:39.501 --> 32:42.713
Yo. The door is moving.

32:44.882 --> 32:46.008
Listen to me, CJ.

32:46.675 --> 32:48.051
- Are you listening?
- Yeah.

32:48.051 --> 32:52.264
You tell your dad you've eaten something
you shouldn't have.

32:52.264 --> 32:54.183
You think you've been food poisoned.

32:54.683 --> 32:56.977
Then you go straight to bed.

32:57.811 --> 32:59.062
- Okay.
- All right?

33:11.658 --> 33:12.659
Hello, Mr. Ryder.

33:14.077 --> 33:15.287
Something wrong, CJ?

33:16.538 --> 33:18.373
Feeling a little sick here.

33:19.208 --> 33:20.209
Is that right?

33:20.209 --> 33:22.419
It was definitely the food poisoning.

33:22.419 --> 33:24.254
We thought he was just crashing
after the game,

33:24.254 --> 33:26.423
and then we figured out
he must've eaten something.

33:27.216 --> 33:30.928
Well, that's funny
'cause no one else looks food poisoned.

33:31.595 --> 33:34.890
Who knows how long the food
had sat out by the time we got there?

33:36.975 --> 33:39.686
Just wanna go to bed, Pops.

33:41.271 --> 33:42.856
Feel better, bro.

33:45.692 --> 33:51.365
Well, it's great to see
that CJ made such good friends.

33:53.450 --> 33:55.869
He will see you on the bus in the a.m.

33:57.746 --> 34:00.499
- Good night.
- For you-- I--

34:00.499 --> 34:02.084
- You might want these back.
- Yeah.

34:09.967 --> 34:11.301
We gotta scoop Drew.

34:13.428 --> 34:15.013
I got something to tell y'all.

34:31.321 --> 34:33.949
- Yo, yo!
- What's up, man?

34:33.949 --> 34:36.784
- What's up with it, bro?
- So, how did everything go?

34:36.784 --> 34:39.955
- Look, man. Buckle up.
- What was it like? What happened?

34:39.955 --> 34:41.373
- I mean...
- He was chill.

34:41.373 --> 34:42.708
...I think he bought it.

34:43.583 --> 34:46.170
Plus, I think Jace over here, he did--

34:46.920 --> 34:48.964
He didn't give The Enforcer a choice.

34:48.964 --> 34:50.007
- For real.
- Nah, man.

34:50.007 --> 34:52.050
The Enforcer made me wish
I'd gotten food poisoning.

34:52.050 --> 34:54.011
- What is you saying?
- But, like, actually--

34:54.011 --> 34:56.346
No, because it was like he came out
of retirement

34:56.346 --> 34:59.641
just to scare us into never stepping
on his driveway.

35:00.559 --> 35:02.519
I was wondering why it smelled like puke.

35:02.519 --> 35:04.605
- Dawg. Bro. Don't--
- I got a whole whiff.

35:04.605 --> 35:05.814
Don't even bring that up, fam.

35:05.814 --> 35:06.982
- Wild, bro.
- That was crazy.

35:06.982 --> 35:08.066
Stop here.

35:09.818 --> 35:10.819
All right.

35:30.172 --> 35:32.841
Yo, you-- You okay?

35:36.011 --> 35:37.346
Sorry I blew up at you.

35:37.346 --> 35:39.348
You've been off all night.

35:39.890 --> 35:42.768
- Yeah, Jace. What's going on, man?
- What did you wanna talk about?

35:43.477 --> 35:45.938
Crystal told me something
at Royale's party.

35:46.688 --> 35:50.359
Her old coach told Krista Cooke
he knows who attacked him.

35:56.532 --> 35:58.408
But I think it's bullshit.

35:58.408 --> 36:01.036
And you're telling us this now?

36:01.036 --> 36:03.413
Guys, he's full of shit.

36:04.498 --> 36:05.499
This is bad.

36:05.499 --> 36:08.418
This could derail
everything we've been working for, man!

36:08.418 --> 36:11.505
- It won't! I won't let it.
- How do you figure?

36:11.505 --> 36:14.174
If we act like nothing happened,
they can't touch us.

36:15.259 --> 36:18.470
And I promise you,
I'm not gonna say anything.

36:20.389 --> 36:21.682
No matter what.

36:26.311 --> 36:27.312
Fuck.

36:27.896 --> 36:28.981
I'm sorry, y'all.

36:29.481 --> 36:31.650
- Jesus.
- I'm with Jace.

36:35.070 --> 36:36.071
Look...

36:38.991 --> 36:43.829
when it first happened four years ago,
I'm not gonna lie, I was terrified.

36:44.913 --> 36:45.914
I was.

36:46.999 --> 36:52.254
Okay. I would sit by my window every night
just waiting for the police to come.

36:53.881 --> 36:55.549
I c-- I couldn't sleep for months.

36:56.049 --> 36:58.760
I'm not putting myself through that again.

37:01.346 --> 37:02.347
I'm not.

37:04.683 --> 37:06.226
So, y'all listen to me, all right?

37:06.810 --> 37:07.853
Jace is right!

37:08.520 --> 37:09.646
Nothing happened then,

37:10.439 --> 37:13.317
and nothing is going to happen now.

37:34.213 --> 37:36.757
All right, bro. Happy birthday.

38:15.587 --> 38:16.797
I saw that video.

38:20.801 --> 38:21.802
What video?

38:21.802 --> 38:24.221
The one of you and the girl
you were with last night.

38:25.681 --> 38:28.100
You haven't even introduced her to me.

38:28.100 --> 38:29.560
I saw her at the games.

38:29.560 --> 38:31.895
I saw that her family funded
the new science building.

38:31.895 --> 38:34.147
- Who is she to you?
- We're just friends.

38:35.440 --> 38:36.942
That's not what she thinks.

38:36.942 --> 38:39.403
Or for that matter, the Internet.
Are you sleeping with her?

38:39.403 --> 38:41.280
Whoa. That's private.

38:41.280 --> 38:44.074
You the one
who put your business out there like that.

38:47.286 --> 38:50.330
You don't wanna lose your focus
on your future.

38:50.330 --> 38:52.833
You're two years away from the NBA.

38:58.547 --> 39:00.674
Okay, Ma. You're right.

39:04.803 --> 39:05.804
I got it.

39:19.067 --> 39:20.777
- Hey, Son. How you doing?
- Hey, Dad.

39:50.807 --> 39:52.893
How come you didn't attack that man,
Daddy?

39:53.519 --> 39:56.605
I had to suspend his kid.
We can't reward bad behavior.

39:56.605 --> 39:59.274
You can't let them get under your skin, Emory.

39:59.274 --> 40:01.568
Because if they do, they win.

40:01.568 --> 40:03.779
And there's too much at stake
to let that happen.

40:04.780 --> 40:05.614
Isn't there?

40:06.490 --> 40:11.036
Only award those who win your respect.

40:16.083 --> 40:19.086
- You kept your end of the bargain.
- You sound surprised.

40:19.086 --> 40:22.089
Even though you fouled me,
I can see why your players respect you.

40:23.215 --> 40:24.216
I called the board,

40:24.216 --> 40:27.553
and I gave them my recommendation
that you no longer be interim.

40:28.554 --> 40:29.763
You earned it.

40:29.763 --> 40:34.935
So, congratulations.
You're official head coach.

40:37.896 --> 40:39.147
Thank you, Emory.

40:41.191 --> 40:46.613
I-- I know
how big of a opportunity this is.

40:47.447 --> 40:51.076
And this will be a win,
not only for my family and the kids

40:51.076 --> 40:52.703
but for Cedar Cove too.

40:54.037 --> 40:59.042
And just so we're clear,
I didn't foul you.

41:02.921 --> 41:04.339
Good luck in New York.

41:17.686 --> 41:20.856
There's a ceremony for everything
that should be right in your life.

41:32.367 --> 41:34.953
This is the best cup of coffee
I've had in my life.

41:35.996 --> 41:37.122
I'm glad you like it.

41:38.248 --> 41:42.419
But Ike adds a certain gravitas
to Cedar Cove now that he's here.

41:43.212 --> 41:46.298
It's the name on the front of the jersey
that brings gravitas.

41:48.050 --> 41:51.094
I know, but-- I'm sorry, just one sec.

42:00.604 --> 42:02.940
I'm sorry. I-- I have to go.

42:04.441 --> 42:06.235
Story's about to be killed.

42:06.902 --> 42:08.779
I'd hoped
to be the one out in front of it.

42:09.446 --> 42:12.199
- Out in front of what?
- I'll text you when it drops.

42:22.376 --> 42:23.377
What's up, Royale?

42:24.336 --> 42:25.337
Hi, Jared.

42:27.005 --> 42:27.840
Johnny.

42:32.344 --> 42:33.512
What's wrong?

42:35.514 --> 42:36.723
I just-- I got a headache.

42:50.445 --> 42:53.115
I want to thank you all for your support.

42:53.115 --> 42:57.911
And it's because of you guys that
you're looking at your new head coach.

42:58.704 --> 42:59.913
No longer interim.

43:03.333 --> 43:04.334
What's going on?

43:07.963 --> 43:09.047
What the hell?

43:34.907 --> 43:38.493
Yo, I need to know
if there's any truth to this.

43:45.792 --> 43:47.377
There's nothing to it, Coach.

43:50.506 --> 43:51.840
You sure?

43:53.467 --> 43:54.468
Yes.

44:02.309 --> 44:03.894
Let's get back on the bus.
