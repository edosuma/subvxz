22:15.436 --> 22:19.339
Oh, no, I need to get to her
before she gets to us.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.142
- How do you think
Cece will feel

22:21.208 --> 22:22.442
about her mum coming?

22:22.509 --> 22:24.044
GINGER:
She'll feel nothing!

22:24.110 --> 22:26.413
Because she's not coming.

22:26.480 --> 22:29.850
And we're not gonna tell Cece
about any of this.

BOTH:
Wow.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.830
- It's all my fault.
I should have known.

22:43.897 --> 22:45.432
But Shakespeare's
just a writer,

22:45.499 --> 22:47.500
so I figured it was all
just a big, fantastical story.

22:47.567 --> 22:49.236
First, Benoit canceled our date

22:49.303 --> 22:52.039
with a big, fat,
and totally fake lie;

22:52.106 --> 22:54.075
Adrian acted
like a total weirdo;

22:54.141 --> 22:55.943
and then Jack fell down
the steps

22:56.009 --> 22:57.444
and twisted his ankle.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.613
It's bad.
He had to go to the hospital.

22:59.680 --> 23:02.049
I can't believe
this is actually happening.

23:02.116 --> 23:03.884
- Whoa, intrigue.

23:05.886 --> 23:07.654
- Nice capes, by the way.

23:07.721 --> 23:10.224
So now Benoit's playing Macbeth
in the midseason show,

23:10.290 --> 23:11.659
which, in my opinion,

23:11.725 --> 23:13.860
he should've been cast as
in the first place.

23:13.927 --> 23:17.497
I don't believe in this whole
Macbeth thing, but he lied.

23:17.564 --> 23:19.499
And Benoit's not
the lying type.

23:22.469 --> 23:23.503
What?

23:24.738 --> 23:26.506
- Did you just say...

23:26.573 --> 23:29.209
- That the midseason show is...

23:29.276 --> 23:30.811
- Macbeth? Yeah.

23:30.878 --> 23:34.080

So I guess you guys know
about the curse too?
