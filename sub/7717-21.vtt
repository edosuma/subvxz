WEBVTT

00:04.170 --> 00:12.244
[cheerâ™ª l music]

00:35.268 --> 00:37.169
- I'm taking some time off
from work--

00:37.171 --> 00:38.670
Well, my other work--

00:38.672 --> 00:43.242
Because we needed it.

00:43.244 --> 00:44.510
- It's great.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.578
- It's great.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.480
- The phone's been ringing
off the hook.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.282
The guys in philly
are kind of going nuts.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.651
- But that doesn't matter.

00:52.653 --> 00:55.421
This does.

00:55.423 --> 00:58.190
It's the only thing
that matters.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.825
We've had some
really nice days together.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.660
- Mm-hmm.

01:01.662 --> 01:02.628
Nice morning, too.

01:02.630 --> 01:06.632
- Beesly.
Oh, my god.

01:08.569 --> 01:13.272
Which tie makes me look
like a guy who likes sofas?

01:13.274 --> 01:15.240
My agent's putting me up
for a furniture commercial.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.709
- Ah.
Definitely blue.

01:17.711 --> 01:21.413
- Totally, right?

01:21.415 --> 01:24.650
So, big tuna, what's up?
Back in the small pond?

01:24.652 --> 01:26.385
- For now, yeah, yeah.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.487
I was just spreading myself
way too thin--

01:28.489 --> 01:30.456
- Thin-sliced tuna.
Carpaccio.

01:30.458 --> 01:31.623
Go on.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.659
- Uh, well,
it took me a while.

01:33.661 --> 01:37.129
But I finally realized
that I can't give 100%

01:37.131 --> 01:38.697
To two things at once,
you know?

01:38.699 --> 01:41.266
- Yeah.
Tell me about it.

01:41.268 --> 01:44.269
I've been trying to act
and manage this branch.

01:44.271 --> 01:48.340
My stage makeup
or my work makeup.

01:48.342 --> 01:53.212
So you gotta ask yourself
what makes you the happiest.

01:53.214 --> 01:56.115
You just go all in
for what's most important.

01:56.117 --> 01:59.184
That's my new thing.

02:08.361 --> 02:12.164
- Whoa.

02:12.166 --> 02:13.866
- Is everything okay?

02:13.868 --> 02:17.236
- No.
Everything is not okay.

02:19.172 --> 02:20.405
The county took my cats.

02:20.407 --> 02:21.807
- Wait, all of them?

02:21.809 --> 02:24.243
- Two sacks' worth.

02:24.245 --> 02:27.513
Apparently, my apartment
complex has rules

02:27.515 --> 02:31.783
About how many pets
are too many for a studio.

02:31.785 --> 02:35.754
And while I was out
picking philip up

02:35.756 --> 02:38.524
From daycare,
they came.

02:38.526 --> 02:41.260
They came
into my house.

02:41.262 --> 02:43.595
- That's--that's awful, angela.
I'm so sorry.

02:43.597 --> 02:46.365
- It's the [bleep]
that lives downstairs.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.867
She's this uptight,
judgmental shrew.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.602
You know the type.

02:50.604 --> 02:55.440
- I've never met anyone
like that.

02:55.442 --> 02:57.943
- And they're gone.

02:57.945 --> 03:01.747
And I have no one left.

03:01.749 --> 03:06.818
Without my cats, I am
utterly and completely alone.

03:09.255 --> 03:10.522
- Angela, you still
have your son.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.358
- [scoffs]
I guess.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.395
- Attention, everyone.
May I have your attention?

03:16.397 --> 03:21.366
There are four new
deadly weapons in this office.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.368
Basher, thrasher,
crasher, and--

03:23.370 --> 03:24.436
- Smasher.

03:24.438 --> 03:25.437
- "smasher"?

03:25.439 --> 03:26.538
No.
Where'd you get that?

03:26.540 --> 03:27.539
Fireball.

03:27.541 --> 03:30.375
Cut!

03:30.377 --> 03:32.578
This morning,
after hours of combat

03:32.580 --> 03:37.616
I earned my black belt
in <i>goju ryu</i> martial arts.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.384
I had to find
a new dojo

03:39.386 --> 03:41.220
After sensei ira and I
parted ways.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.921
My new sensei,
sensei billy,

03:42.923 --> 03:44.723
Thought I had
more than enough training

03:44.725 --> 03:49.595
Turns out sensei ira
was a bit of a shyster.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.930
Sensei billy
says most students

03:51.932 --> 03:54.666
Don't spend $150,000
over 20 years

03:54.668 --> 03:55.767
To get
their black belt.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.936
I would like
to invite you all

03:57.938 --> 03:59.371
To my black belt ceremony,

03:59.373 --> 04:02.574
Right here in the office
at lunch,

04:02.576 --> 04:06.812
Lunch not provided.

04:10.316 --> 04:14.353
- Fireball!
- Ahh!

04:14.355 --> 04:16.388
That's how
it's done.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.490
- That's pretty good.
I feel safe.

04:25.965 --> 04:28.400
- [whispering] hey, erin.
Is andy in?

04:30.003 --> 04:31.970
- Oh, is andy in?

04:31.972 --> 04:34.306
Sorry, I-I thought
you said "is indian?"

04:34.308 --> 04:36.275
And I was like,
"is indian what?"

04:36.277 --> 04:37.609
[chuckles]

04:37.611 --> 04:39.444
Is indian food good?

04:39.446 --> 04:41.346
Is indian jewelry pretty?

04:41.348 --> 04:43.415
Is indian hair
an expensive kind of wig?

04:43.417 --> 04:45.317
Yes to all three,
by the way.

04:45.319 --> 04:47.753
Lately, I've been
having a lot of trouble

04:47.755 --> 04:49.321
Keeping track
of andy's calendar.

04:49.323 --> 04:52.324
His student film audition
schedule is crazy hectic.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.525
Yes.
There's andy.

04:53.527 --> 04:54.826
Andy is in.
I'm a good receptionist.

04:54.828 --> 04:55.994
I know
he's in.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.797
- David walrus
in his native habitat.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.332
- [laughs uncomfortably]
hey, andy.

05:00.334 --> 05:01.466
Can we go in your office
and talk?

05:01.468 --> 05:02.934
- Yeah.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.070
- This isn't gonna
be an easy conversation.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.005
I told andy that he was
on very thin ice

05:07.007 --> 05:09.574
When he snuck away for three
months to the caribbean.

05:09.576 --> 05:11.777
Then last week,
he used company money

05:11.779 --> 05:13.979
To buy a top-of-the-line
photo printer.

05:13.981 --> 05:17.516
In his words, "the kind
that's good for head shots."

05:17.518 --> 05:21.019
And yesterday, he asked me
to pay for cheek implants.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.888
Claimed it's going
to boost office morale.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.523
Now, he's a good guy.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.459
But honestly,
at a certain point,

05:27.461 --> 05:29.328
The ice gets too thin,

05:29.330 --> 05:32.497
And you fall through.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.999
And that is
when you get fired.

05:37.470 --> 05:39.438
- I'm gonna stop you
right there.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.040
David, this documentary
is going to air in two weeks.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.409
I feel like it's a once
in a lifetime opportunity

05:44.411 --> 05:45.544
To pursue my dream.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.012
- Uh-huh.
But--

05:47.014 --> 05:49.815
- Every minute
that I spend here

05:49.817 --> 05:52.484
Is time not spent
making audition videos

05:52.486 --> 05:55.821
For reality dating,
cooking, or singing shows.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.723
I got a real shot here.

05:57.725 --> 06:00.992
And I'll never be able
to forgive myself

06:00.994 --> 06:02.527
If I blew it
because I was too focused

06:02.529 --> 06:04.529
On my stupid
paper company job.

06:04.531 --> 06:08.100
- So you think you've been
too focused on your job?

06:08.102 --> 06:09.968
- At my last
head shot sitting,

06:09.970 --> 06:12.738
Wondering what I was
missing at work

06:12.740 --> 06:14.439
That I came across
totally manic.

06:14.441 --> 06:17.376
And I was going for zany.

06:17.378 --> 06:19.478
- [chuckles]

06:19.480 --> 06:21.513
So you--you want
to quit dunder mifflin

06:21.515 --> 06:22.514
To pursue acting?

06:22.516 --> 06:25.016
- Well, no, actually.

06:25.018 --> 06:29.121
I see no reason to
limit myself to just acting.

06:29.123 --> 06:32.391
I am pursuing fame
of any kind.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.860
Could be singing.
Could be dancing.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.495
I don't--it just--

06:36.497 --> 06:40.098
I owe it to myself
and my future fans.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.034
- Uh, well, I guess
I can't stand

06:43.036 --> 06:46.405
In the way
of a man's dream.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.473
And it seems
like you have the gift.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.145
- Thank you, david.

06:53.147 --> 06:54.713
- There's probably no way
I can talk you

06:54.715 --> 06:56.148
Into staying
at this point, huh?

06:56.150 --> 06:58.717
- Nope.
I have made up my mind.

06:58.719 --> 06:59.818
I'm really sorry.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.486
- Well, good luck.

07:01.488 --> 07:03.422
- Hey, thank you.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.423
Not gonna need it.

07:04.425 --> 07:08.460
- Okay.
- [chuckles]

07:11.030 --> 07:12.597
- [exhales]

07:12.599 --> 07:13.598
[laughs]

07:13.600 --> 07:15.901
- Well, that kind of worked out.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.937
- I think just about anybody
could be a star.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.106
My postman,
the night janitor here--

07:21.108 --> 07:23.775
But andy?
No, definitely not.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.610
Charisma black hole.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.751
- Oh.
Clark.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.520
I'm actually here today.
Surprise.

07:35.522 --> 07:37.956
So I was wondering if maybe
I could have my desk back.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.524
- Right.
Yeah.

07:39.526 --> 07:41.560
But, you know, I've actually
been working

07:41.562 --> 07:43.562
Pretty hard here
on a daily basis.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.697
So I kind of feel
like I've earned this.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.865
I mean, you know?
- You totally have.

07:46.867 --> 07:51.102
But maybe I could be
with my wife.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.604
It's kind of the whole reason
why I'm here.

07:52.606 --> 07:53.672
- Right.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.540
Well, I'm here
to sell paper.

07:55.542 --> 07:56.875
[knocks on desk]

07:56.877 --> 07:59.945
- Burn.
- Wow.

08:02.181 --> 08:05.183
- All right, jim, look.
I just got made junior salesman.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.985
Right?
And--and wallace is here today.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.520
And I don't want him
to just think of me

08:08.522 --> 08:11.957
As a customer service rep
that sits in the annex.

08:11.959 --> 08:12.991
I mean, you can
get that, right?

08:12.993 --> 08:16.661
And what do you need
more face time with wallace for?

08:16.663 --> 08:21.733
You trying to get a--
a second second job here?

08:21.735 --> 08:22.734
- It's okay.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.102
You can sit
in the annex.

08:24.104 --> 08:27.806
- What?
- I'll come visit you.

08:30.142 --> 08:32.043
- Okay.

08:32.045 --> 08:33.712
The annex it is.

08:33.714 --> 08:34.980
I'll be sitting
at your desk,

08:34.982 --> 08:36.581
If that's okay
with you.

08:36.583 --> 08:37.816
- It's fine with me.
Have fun.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.117
But be careful.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.119
It is very easy
to get lost

08:41.121 --> 08:45.690
In pete's beautiful,
dead eyes.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.960
- Everyone,
a little breaking news for you.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.162
Just had a little chat
with david wallace.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.965
And, um, I'm taking
a leave of absence

08:53.967 --> 08:56.735
From dunder mifflin
forever.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.570
- I can't say
we didn't see it coming,

08:58.572 --> 09:01.239
But it's a sad day
when anybody is fired.

09:01.241 --> 09:04.309
- Uh, uh, uh, uh,
andy was not fired.

09:04.311 --> 09:05.744
- I wasn't fired.

09:05.746 --> 09:08.013
[chuckling]
what are you talking about?

09:08.015 --> 09:11.716
I'm fired up. Yes.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.952
Guys, I'm--
I'm leaving to pursue

09:13.954 --> 09:16.121
My lifelong dream
of being famous.

09:16.123 --> 09:19.691
- Oh, andy.
[all mumbling]

09:19.693 --> 09:23.695
- Yeah, so I'll see you
on the red carpet.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.330
[solitary clapping,
mumbling continues]

09:25.332 --> 09:27.999
'cause see,
that's how it works.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.969
- Andy sings beautifully,

09:30.971 --> 09:32.604
And he's really good
at dancing.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.606
He's a good speaker.

09:34.608 --> 09:38.009
But there's just something there
you don't want to look at.

09:40.313 --> 09:44.883
- Heyyou probablyoing
as your dmiss clark.Y the way?

09:44.885 --> 09:46.985
- Yeah, a little bit.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.020
- Oh, wow.
But, um--oh, I get that--

09:49.022 --> 09:51.222
- Oh, no, no.
No, it's cool.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.792
- I get it.
- It's cool, man.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.261
I'm sure you and I
will have our own thing.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.797
- Yeah.
Definitely.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.132
Go phillies, right?

10:01.134 --> 10:04.336
You don't watch baseball.
I keep forgetting that.

10:04.338 --> 10:07.138
- I just think you're going
into this a little fast.

10:07.140 --> 10:10.041
- I'm 38, darryl.
How much slower should I go?

10:10.043 --> 10:12.143
- Show business is cold.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.879
Let's say you get a job,
which you probably won't.

10:14.881 --> 10:17.082
They're not gonna cut you
any slack.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.684
You're meant for a job
with lots and lots of slack.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.286
- [chuckles]

10:21.288 --> 10:23.788
All right.
I get it.

10:23.790 --> 10:27.892
The male
is a funny species.

10:27.894 --> 10:29.628
We don't just tell each other
how we feel.

10:29.630 --> 10:30.996
That's chick stuff.

10:30.998 --> 10:35.233
So instead of saying,
"hey, andy, I love you, man.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.168
I don't want you to leave,"

10:37.170 --> 10:40.338
You say something like,

10:40.340 --> 10:42.207
"hey, andy, you're making
the worst mistake of your life.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.776
You're not talented."

10:44.778 --> 10:47.712
Well...

10:47.714 --> 10:50.348
Right back at you, darryl.

10:54.954 --> 10:56.821
[sighs]

10:56.823 --> 11:00.291
I'm gonna miss you, too.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.327
Mmm!

11:02.329 --> 11:04.195
- Andy's from the generation
that thinks

11:04.197 --> 11:05.797
They should all be famous.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.232
What happened
to the generation

11:07.234 --> 11:09.434
That knew you shut up,
did your work,

11:09.436 --> 11:11.970
And died quietly
from a heart attack?

11:11.972 --> 11:15.240
- Could andy make it
as an entertainer?

11:15.242 --> 11:16.274
I don't know.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.976
You know
who's really funny?

11:17.978 --> 11:21.212
This bird in the park
that can't fly right.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.181
I'd pay to see him.

11:23.183 --> 11:27.018
But I don't have to,
'cause the park is free.

11:30.156 --> 11:31.890
Both: Hyuh! Hyah!

11:31.892 --> 11:33.191
- I will now perform

11:33.193 --> 11:34.259
The ceremonial changing
of the belts.

11:34.261 --> 11:37.796
The ceremonial changing
of the belts.

11:37.798 --> 11:40.031
- It's not a large room.
I think they heard me.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.766
- Take my belt, master.

11:41.768 --> 11:44.736
I now submit to you
every part of myself.

11:44.738 --> 11:45.870
- That's really okay.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.106
I'm mostly focused
on the belt here.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.442
- Just slip it off my--
slip it off my hips.

11:50.444 --> 11:53.311
- Hold it--
take a step back.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.213
Take a step back.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.349
[sighs]

11:58.351 --> 12:00.118
Okay, okay,
I can't--

12:00.120 --> 12:03.221
I can't do this if you're gonna
be thrusting like that, okay?

12:03.223 --> 12:07.058
I think we're gonna have
to cut this off.

12:07.060 --> 12:11.763
The ceremonial cutting off
of the belt.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.398
He--oh.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.767
- [sighs]

12:15.769 --> 12:18.436
- Gah! Hyah!

12:18.438 --> 12:22.140
- Dwight has been
practicing karate for years.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.408
When we were dating,

12:23.410 --> 12:26.010
I would help him
with his strength training.

12:26.012 --> 12:28.012
He would strap me
to his chest

12:28.014 --> 12:31.082
In a baby bjorn
made for fat children

12:31.084 --> 12:35.053
And do lunges
across the farm.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.355
I felt
like I was flying.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.423
- There it is.
[applause]

12:38.425 --> 12:40.258
[grunts]

12:40.260 --> 12:43.995
- Congratulations.
- We did it, we did it.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.296
I love you.
- Okay.

12:45.298 --> 12:48.066
- Thanks.

12:48.068 --> 12:53.138
I will now perform
my final kata forms.

12:53.140 --> 12:56.174
You're going to watch me, right?
- Yes, I will.

12:56.176 --> 12:59.544
- [shouting]

12:59.546 --> 13:01.312
Sensei, you're not watching.
- Yeah, I'm watching.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.047
Just do it.

13:03.049 --> 13:06.084
- [shouting]

13:06.086 --> 13:09.154
[exhales]

13:11.891 --> 13:13.858
Ho!
Ha!

13:13.860 --> 13:15.527
Watching?
- I'm watching.

13:15.529 --> 13:18.463
- [grunting]
watch this part, okay?

13:18.465 --> 13:20.932
Huh, gah!
Gah!

13:20.934 --> 13:25.303
Ha, ha, whoo.
- Oh!

13:25.305 --> 13:29.040
- Sensei, do you generally
do house calls like this?

13:29.042 --> 13:31.075
- Uh, you can just
call me billy.

13:31.077 --> 13:33.244
And no.
No, but dwight insisted.

13:33.246 --> 13:34.546
He wanted
to receive his black belt

13:34.548 --> 13:36.381
In the place
he loves most in the world.

13:36.383 --> 13:37.982
- He said that?

13:37.984 --> 13:40.852
[dwight continues
karate shouts]

13:40.854 --> 13:45.490
He's an odd guy, isn't he?
- Yes.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.992
Irritating?
Also yes.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.394
But I've got
to hand it to him,

13:49.396 --> 13:51.830
He is one of the most
tenacious and determined men

13:51.832 --> 13:53.364
I've ever met.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.366
- Hyuah! Hah!

13:55.368 --> 13:57.235
Hut!

13:57.237 --> 14:00.371
[exhales]

14:00.373 --> 14:01.506
Ha--ah!

14:01.508 --> 14:04.342
Unh! Kyah!

14:04.344 --> 14:08.146
[growls softly]

14:08.148 --> 14:10.415
Ha! Ahah! Aah!

14:10.417 --> 14:14.452
[applause]

14:14.454 --> 14:16.187
- Oh!

14:16.189 --> 14:19.190
I am so proud of you,
schrooberry blue.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.126
[laughter]

14:24.864 --> 14:27.932
- And--and nothingke
I is worth that.R.

14:27.934 --> 14:29.167
- Well, I tell you, jim,

14:29.169 --> 14:30.468
A lot of guys
in my circle?

14:30.470 --> 14:32.470
They wouldn't even
change their golf schedule

14:32.472 --> 14:38.376
Let alone
their professional goals.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.546
- Dude, there is no way
that jim is just back here

14:41.548 --> 14:43.248
To "hang out with pam."

14:43.250 --> 14:46.985
- [scoffs]
you did not just say that.

14:46.987 --> 14:49.621
You don't know pam.
She is really cool.

14:49.623 --> 14:52.891
- All I'm saying is,
forget about my chair.

14:52.893 --> 14:54.926
He wants
the manager's chair.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.227
And I thought
you wanted that job.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.562
- Yeah, I did.

14:57.564 --> 15:01.032
But I made
too many mistakes.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.301
It's out
of my reach now.

15:03.303 --> 15:07.405
Besides, I think jim
would be a fine manager.

15:07.407 --> 15:11.276
I'd be happy
to see jim as manager.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.544
- So the reason
I called you in here

15:13.546 --> 15:15.179
Is because andy
is moving on.

15:15.181 --> 15:16.180
- Again.

15:16.182 --> 15:17.916
- Again.
[chuckles]

15:17.918 --> 15:22.520
And I'm looking
for a new manager.

15:22.522 --> 15:25.323
And with his performance
this year,

15:25.325 --> 15:29.394
I have been
considering dwight.

15:29.396 --> 15:32.463
Am I crazy?

15:32.465 --> 15:34.365
- Not at all.

15:34.367 --> 15:37.535
It should be dwight.

15:37.537 --> 15:41.005
- [sighs] you sure?

15:41.007 --> 15:43.308
In a lot more
liability insurance,

15:43.310 --> 15:45.109
But, uh...
- Yeah.

15:45.111 --> 15:48.313
- Hey, if there's someone who
loves paper more than dwight,

15:48.315 --> 15:50.148
I definitely don't want
to meet that person.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.717
- [chuckles]

15:52.719 --> 15:55.653
[sighs]

15:55.655 --> 15:59.657
- Andy, we just wondered
if we could have a word.

15:59.659 --> 16:00.992
- It's now or never.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.427
- Well, we just had
a quick question

16:02.429 --> 16:04.996
About this decision
of yours.

16:04.998 --> 16:07.432
You know,
to leave a stable job

16:07.434 --> 16:11.102
And pursue a career
in the entertainment business

16:11.104 --> 16:12.437
In your late 30s

16:12.439 --> 16:14.472
With no savings
to fall back on

16:14.474 --> 16:17.008
And no real connections
in that business,

16:17.010 --> 16:19.711
Which can be competitive.

16:19.713 --> 16:21.412
- Yeah, sure.
What's your question?

16:21.414 --> 16:25.350
- Our question is--

16:25.352 --> 16:27.986
It seems dumb.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.021
- Well, it's better
than sticking around here

16:30.023 --> 16:31.489
And half-assing it,
right?

16:31.491 --> 16:32.657
- Of course.

16:32.659 --> 16:37.562
But what if you were
to stay here,

16:37.564 --> 16:41.132
You know,
and "full-ass" it?

16:41.134 --> 16:43.201
- Yeah.
- Um, really give it a go?

16:43.203 --> 16:46.537
Be the greatest manager
in the history of this branch

16:46.539 --> 16:48.039
And in that way,

16:48.041 --> 16:50.041
Achieve the fame
and immortality that you seek?

16:50.043 --> 16:52.143
Hmm?

16:52.145 --> 16:54.379
- Nah.
I like my plan better.

16:54.381 --> 16:58.316
- Well, andy,
your plan sucks, okay?

16:58.318 --> 17:01.419
Nobody is going
to hire you ever.

17:01.421 --> 17:04.422
You're too character-y
to be a lead,

17:04.424 --> 17:07.392
And you're not fat enough
to be a great character actor.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.761
- What?

17:09.763 --> 17:13.097
- No, I don't think
he can make it as an actor.

17:13.099 --> 17:16.067
But he also can't make it
as an employee in an office,

17:16.069 --> 17:19.137
So, you know,
why not go nuts with it?

17:19.139 --> 17:22.740
- Hey, are you still in charge
of office supplies?

17:22.742 --> 17:25.743
- Yes. Yeah.

17:25.745 --> 17:28.046
- I seem to have
a sticky note emergency,

17:28.048 --> 17:29.814
Where I grab it
on the wrong end,

17:29.816 --> 17:31.082
And then,
this happens.

17:31.084 --> 17:34.585
- If you could
help me out, that would be--

17:34.587 --> 17:37.255
- I could give you
some beginner stickies?

17:37.257 --> 17:38.689
- Anything would help.
Thank you.

17:38.691 --> 17:39.757
- Here you go.

17:39.759 --> 17:44.395
If you did have a salt packet,
three tacks, and some aspirin,

17:44.397 --> 17:45.496
That'd be great.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.732
Oh, wow. You have that.
- Mm-hmm.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.801
- Wow, that's--
- it's all yours.

17:49.803 --> 17:51.803
- You come so prepared.
- [chuckles]

17:51.805 --> 17:53.838
- Aspirin.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.373
If you want to get rid
of a headache,

17:55.375 --> 17:56.507
You sit
on something sharp.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.676
Any sensei
will tell you that.

17:58.678 --> 18:02.480
- Hey, congratulations
on that black belt, man.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.749
It's really great.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.752
- Thank you.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.720
So I saw you talking
to wallace earlier.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.322
Is he going to offer you
the manager's job?

18:11.324 --> 18:13.825
- No.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.726
He was maybe thinking
of you for it.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.695
- Yeah, right.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.864
I'm afraid that ship
has sailed.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.767
- I wouldn't be too sure
about that.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.470
Just saying.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.675
- [whistling]

18:30.677 --> 18:32.643
- [whistling]

18:32.645 --> 18:34.846
- Hello.
- Well, hello.

18:34.848 --> 18:37.615
- Big day for you.
- Thank you.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.417
- Love the belt.
- Oh, yes.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.751
- You know, I don't know
anything about karate,

18:40.753 --> 18:42.553
But I have broken
a few boards in my day.

18:42.555 --> 18:43.788
- Hi-yah.
- [chuckles]

18:43.790 --> 18:46.824
Diving boards
at my family pool in redding.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.159
I was an obese child.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.694
I never talk
about that here,

18:49.696 --> 18:52.864
But nard-dog's outta here,
so lettin' it all hang out.

18:52.866 --> 18:54.432
- This is exciting.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.834
You're finally gonna get
to go out and flap your wings.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.769
- Thank you.
I appreciate that.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.738
'cause a lot of people
are saying I might not make it.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.240
- Oh, I doubt
you'll make it.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.208
Very few do
who try to be a star.

19:04.210 --> 19:06.477
But listen,
you've saved up enough money

19:06.479 --> 19:07.778
To take
a couple of years off,

19:07.780 --> 19:10.448
And pursue your dream,
and have some fun, right?

19:10.450 --> 19:13.885
- No, I just applied
for more overdraft protection.

19:13.887 --> 19:16.787
- Andy, I have nothing to gain
from getting you to stay,

19:16.789 --> 19:18.789
And everything to gain
from you leaving.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.324
But please,
I have known you for years.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.360
I have seen you perform.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.462
Dear god,
don't quit your day job.

19:27.599 --> 19:29.200
- [cockney accent]
nothing is impossible

19:29.202 --> 19:30.801
To him who will try.

19:30.803 --> 19:33.871
Alexander the great,
if he were cockney.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.243
- You're bad.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.782
- I'm gonna make it.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.484
Every person
who's been on <i>conan</i>

19:46.486 --> 19:49.654
Has a crazy story
about how they made it.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.756
Every person.

19:51.758 --> 19:54.258
Erin.

19:54.260 --> 19:55.760
Honest erin.
Cannot tell a lie.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.929
- Oh.
- We lay together.

19:57.931 --> 20:01.365
That's something
you can't take back.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.201
- So true.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.836
Is there a question,
or are--what?

20:05.838 --> 20:07.305
- Will you tell me bluntly?

20:07.307 --> 20:09.540
Do you think I'm making
a terrible mistake

20:09.542 --> 20:11.409
Quitting my job
to become an actor?

20:11.411 --> 20:13.878
- Bluntly?
Yes.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.713
Huge mistake.

20:15.715 --> 20:19.283
Andy, honestly, I think
you might become homeless

20:19.285 --> 20:22.720
Or maybe even starve.

20:22.722 --> 20:26.958
- Thank you.

20:30.362 --> 20:34.699
- You can stay on
as a salesman, andy.

20:34.701 --> 20:37.535
- Thank you.

20:40.372 --> 20:42.473
- [clears throat]

20:42.475 --> 20:45.543
Dwight, could you come in here
for a second, please?

22:16.128 --> 22:18.963
- Will you be
the new manager?

22:18.965 --> 22:21.833
- Where?

22:21.835 --> 22:24.135
- Where?
- What branch?

22:24.137 --> 22:27.705
- Here. Scranton.

22:30.075 --> 22:32.176
Come on.

22:32.178 --> 22:34.579
Come on, dwight.
Get up.

22:34.581 --> 22:37.215
Let's go.
It's good news.

22:37.217 --> 22:39.784
- I'm sorry.

22:39.786 --> 22:42.186
I've just waited for this moment
my entire life.

22:42.188 --> 22:43.855
I mean, I was
interim manager once,

22:43.857 --> 22:45.089
But then I shot that gun.

22:45.091 --> 22:46.224
- What?

22:46.226 --> 22:48.759
- But this isn't
interim manager.

22:48.761 --> 22:51.762
No.

22:51.764 --> 22:55.733
It's dwight k. Schrute...

22:55.735 --> 22:57.235
Manager.

22:57.237 --> 22:58.736
- Why do you already
have this?

22:58.738 --> 23:01.138
Ever got killed
in a traffic accident

23:01.140 --> 23:03.140
And there was a trade show
on the same day.

23:03.142 --> 23:05.610
You will not regret
this decision, david.

23:05.612 --> 23:06.811
- I know.

23:06.813 --> 23:10.781
- I will never,
ever let you down.

23:10.783 --> 23:12.950
- I know, dwight.

23:12.952 --> 23:16.521
I know.

23:16.523 --> 23:17.655
[laughs]

23:17.657 --> 23:19.223
Okay.

23:19.225 --> 23:21.859
Okay.
All righty.

23:21.861 --> 23:23.928
You're gonna do great.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.748
- Hey.
- Wow, hey.

23:43.750 --> 23:46.851
- Hi.

23:46.853 --> 23:48.619
[exhales]
- what's up?

23:48.621 --> 23:51.756
- Um, I have a question.
- Okay.

23:51.758 --> 23:53.991
- Oh, I had a question.

23:53.993 --> 23:56.294
- Really?

23:56.296 --> 23:58.663
- I did!
- Yeah, totally you did.

23:58.665 --> 24:00.164
- Super important.

24:00.166 --> 24:02.767
- I need you to stay right here
while you think about it.

24:02.769 --> 24:03.734
- Okay.
- All right? I'm gonna wait.

24:03.736 --> 24:06.837
I did not come back here
just to see you.

24:06.839 --> 24:09.006
- No, I'm sure
you did not.

24:09.008 --> 24:10.741
[whispering]
what was your question?

24:10.743 --> 24:13.911
But it might take me
a long time to figure it out.

24:13.913 --> 24:15.046
- Well, then,
I should figure out

24:15.048 --> 24:16.814
Things to do
while I'm waiting.

24:16.816 --> 24:19.216
- Exactly.
[giggles]

24:23.288 --> 24:25.957
- Hey, everybody.
I changed my mind.

24:25.959 --> 24:27.224
Not leaving.

24:27.226 --> 24:29.160
I'm gonna stay on
in sales.

24:29.162 --> 24:32.229
- Oh, thank god...
[laughs]

24:32.231 --> 24:34.932
Because sales could be
your best role yet.

24:34.934 --> 24:36.934
- Hey.
Good choice, man.

24:36.936 --> 24:38.135
Seriously.

24:38.137 --> 24:40.037
Don't wanna see you
in a porn next year.

24:40.039 --> 24:41.372
- Okay.

24:41.374 --> 24:44.275
- Ooh, there's a great play
about a salesman.

24:44.277 --> 24:45.743
- <i>Death of a salesman.</i>

24:45.745 --> 24:47.612
- I don't think so.

24:47.614 --> 24:49.747
- Sure, <i>death of a salesman</i>
<i>by arthur miller.</i>

24:49.749 --> 24:51.248
It's a great play
about crushed dreams.

24:51.250 --> 24:55.953
- Mm, no, this one was written
by spongebob squarepants.

25:04.830 --> 25:07.698
- [groans]

25:07.700 --> 25:10.801
Got any hot leads?

25:13.138 --> 25:15.306
- See, so you just push
from under,

25:15.308 --> 25:18.309
And turn it around,
and boom.

25:18.311 --> 25:19.977
Now, the staple
crimps outward.

25:19.979 --> 25:21.412
- I had
no idea.

25:21.414 --> 25:23.714
And here, I've been stapling
the same way for 20 years

25:23.716 --> 25:25.149
Like a frickin' sheep.

25:25.151 --> 25:28.285
- Look who's back.
- I'm back.

25:28.287 --> 25:30.688
- Oh! Hey, look, and now,
it's like a double date.

25:30.690 --> 25:31.822
- Wow.
- [laughs]

25:31.824 --> 25:34.291
- 'cause, uh--
bop, bop.

25:34.293 --> 25:36.227
Tweedle-lee-doo.
- [sighs]

25:36.229 --> 25:38.763
Actually, maybe we should
go on a double date sometime.

25:38.765 --> 25:41.732
- Yeah, we should do that
for real sometime.

25:41.734 --> 25:44.168
- Well, how about Thursday?

25:44.170 --> 25:46.704
- Oh, well,
Thursday's tough because--

25:46.706 --> 25:47.772
- Weeknights are actually tough
just because--

25:47.774 --> 25:48.873
- They are.
That's true, yeah.

25:48.875 --> 25:49.874
- Just forget it.
[giggles]

25:49.876 --> 25:53.978
Forget I said anything.
- Oh.

25:59.217 --> 26:00.785
- Attention, everyone.

26:00.787 --> 26:02.153
Just a quick announcement.

26:02.155 --> 26:04.755
Little reconfiguration
to the staff.

26:04.757 --> 26:08.693
Dwight schrute--
- david.

26:08.695 --> 26:12.897
And then, I'll never,
ever do it again.

26:12.899 --> 26:14.398
- I don't think so.
- It's just one thing.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.133
Just let me--let me do this--
- dwight--dwight--dwight.

26:16.135 --> 26:17.935
Come on--what I was
about to say is dwight--

26:17.937 --> 26:20.971
[cell phone vibrates]

26:20.973 --> 26:22.206
Oh.

26:22.208 --> 26:23.374
I-I'm sorry,
I gotta--

26:23.376 --> 26:27.144
- Just wait
and send it to voice mail.

26:27.146 --> 26:29.814
- Yeah.

26:29.816 --> 26:32.016
- [groans]

26:32.018 --> 26:36.787
Come on. Come on.

26:42.461 --> 26:44.395
- Then we'll get him
a new set of drums.

26:44.397 --> 26:45.896
- Oh, my god.
[door closes]

26:45.898 --> 26:48.833
Oh, my god.
[groans]

26:55.207 --> 27:01.112
Dwight schrute
is manager!

27:01.114 --> 27:02.980
[laughs]
- oh, yeah!

27:02.982 --> 27:06.317
- Whoo!
[laughs]

27:06.319 --> 27:08.352
- Brava.
Brava.

27:08.354 --> 27:10.287
- Way to go, dwight.
- Whoo!

27:10.289 --> 27:14.892
- Creed bratton
is the new manager!

27:16.828 --> 27:18.229
- Congrats.

27:18.231 --> 27:21.532
- What's going on?
- Dwight's the new manager.

27:21.534 --> 27:22.900
He freaking did it.

27:22.902 --> 27:27.438
- Congratulations, dwight.

27:27.440 --> 27:29.206
- Pam.

27:29.208 --> 27:32.510
- Congratulations, buddy.

27:35.814 --> 27:37.848
- Thank you, jim.

27:37.850 --> 27:40.384
- Congrats, dwight.

27:40.386 --> 27:43.287
- Get out
of jim's seat.

27:43.289 --> 27:45.022
- Wha--but I fought
for this seat.

27:45.024 --> 27:47.458
- You're an annex kid.
You might be bullpen.

27:47.460 --> 27:48.959
We'll see.
Give it a couple years.

27:48.961 --> 27:51.095
Scram.

27:51.097 --> 27:55.099
- [scoffs]

28:02.574 --> 28:04.875
- [sighs]

28:04.877 --> 28:08.946
It's nice
to have you back.

28:11.516 --> 28:13.417
- So...
- So...

28:13.419 --> 28:15.519
- I wanted to offer you
a new position.

28:15.521 --> 28:17.087
- Let's hear it.

28:17.089 --> 28:19.857
- Assistant regional manager.

28:19.859 --> 28:22.426
- Nope.
Can't accept that job.

28:22.428 --> 28:24.829
It's not a real job.
- Jim.

28:24.831 --> 28:26.397
- I'll tell you
what I could accept

28:26.399 --> 28:29.366
Is assistant
to the regional manager.

28:29.368 --> 28:31.836
That is a real job,
and one I'd be proud to take.

28:31.838 --> 28:34.371
- Shake on it?

28:34.373 --> 28:36.507
[blows raspberry]
done. Way to negotiate, idiot.

28:36.509 --> 28:40.010
[chuckles]

28:40.012 --> 28:43.881
- Don't get me wrong.
I am definitely here for pam.

28:43.883 --> 28:47.618
But this is
an awesome added bonus.

28:55.160 --> 28:56.961
- Hey, I didn't get a chance
to say it, but...

28:56.963 --> 28:58.529
Congratulations, dwight.

28:58.531 --> 28:59.864
[chuckles]
- thank you.

28:59.866 --> 29:02.066
- Ahem.
Yes, congratulations.

29:02.068 --> 29:03.634
- Yeah, and, dwight,
I'd like to be

29:03.636 --> 29:08.038
The first
to say congratulations.

29:08.040 --> 29:12.076
- This is a big day for you.

29:12.078 --> 29:14.245
- Hmm.

29:14.247 --> 29:16.080
Yes, it is.

29:22.153 --> 29:23.621
Carry on.

29:28.159 --> 29:30.628
- How did I just abandon
my dream so quickly?

29:30.630 --> 29:34.164
It's 'cause I had a fallback.
That's the problem.

29:34.166 --> 29:37.334
When you have fallbacks,
it's just easy to give up.

29:37.336 --> 29:39.570
When cortez
landed in mexico,

29:39.572 --> 29:41.906
Only way he got his men
to defeat the aztecs

29:41.908 --> 29:44.275
Was by burning
all of his own boats

29:44.277 --> 29:47.478
So they could never
return home.

29:47.480 --> 29:50.114
Huge dick move,

29:50.116 --> 29:54.351
But very effective.

29:54.353 --> 29:57.288
I need to be that same kind
of dick to myself.

30:01.226 --> 30:03.093
Everyone!
[sighs]

30:03.095 --> 30:05.296
Changed my mind again.
- Which is it now?

30:05.298 --> 30:07.598
Dream or no dream?
- Uh, dream.

30:07.600 --> 30:09.433
Goin' with my dream.

30:09.435 --> 30:11.302
Gotta go all in.
Ain't that right, jim?

30:11.304 --> 30:12.703
- Oh, don't look
at me,

30:12.705 --> 30:14.405
'cause I think you're making
a terrible choice.

30:14.407 --> 30:16.040
- All in!

30:16.042 --> 30:19.243
Whoo!

30:21.613 --> 30:23.614
Toby!

30:23.616 --> 30:26.050
Hey.
I changed my mind again.

30:26.052 --> 30:29.053
I am gonna leave dunder mifflin
to pursue acting after all.

30:29.055 --> 30:30.521
- Okay, then, andy.
- Yeah.

30:30.523 --> 30:32.189
But here's the thing.

30:32.191 --> 30:33.657
I can't have good old
dunder mifflin to fall back on,

30:33.659 --> 30:34.692
Or else
I'll never succeed.

30:34.694 --> 30:36.226
Gotta burn
those boats!

30:36.228 --> 30:38.162
So I need you
to go into my file

30:38.164 --> 30:40.230
And put down
that I was fired for theft

30:40.232 --> 30:43.667
And/or groping wieners.

30:43.669 --> 30:45.169
- A-andy, you know
I can't do that.

30:45.171 --> 30:47.271
It'd be lying.
- Seriously?

30:47.273 --> 30:51.108
- Yeah, I'm--
- come on, just do it.

30:51.110 --> 30:53.143
- I can't.
- All right, fine.

30:53.145 --> 30:57.748
Just know
that you made me do this.

30:57.750 --> 30:59.717
- Oh, come on.
Andy, no.

30:59.719 --> 31:02.286
- God, toby, don't--
stop blocking my hand.

31:02.288 --> 31:05.055
- This is your--
you brought this on.

31:05.057 --> 31:07.524
- No, no.
Andy.

31:07.526 --> 31:09.727
- Okay, all right.
Groped you good.

31:09.729 --> 31:14.098
Off to hollywood!

31:14.100 --> 31:17.468
- [sighs]

31:17.470 --> 31:21.205
[phone rings]

31:21.207 --> 31:23.107
- This is angela.

31:23.109 --> 31:24.108
Oh.
[clears throat]

31:24.110 --> 31:25.642
Hello, miss polodnikovski.

31:25.644 --> 31:29.079
Uh, how can
I help you?

31:29.081 --> 31:31.148
Did my rent check
not clear?

31:31.150 --> 31:35.252
Because I just transferred
another $25 to that account.

31:35.254 --> 31:37.388
So if there's a problem,
it's clearly on your end.

31:37.390 --> 31:40.157
And--oh.

31:40.159 --> 31:41.658
Oh.
Oh, okay.

31:41.660 --> 31:43.127
Good.

31:43.129 --> 31:44.128
Then, um...
[clears throat]

31:44.130 --> 31:48.265
What is this about?

31:48.267 --> 31:50.234
No, no.
Hey, hey.

31:50.236 --> 31:52.469
No, you are out of line,
miss polodnikovski.

31:52.471 --> 31:54.571
No. No, you are.

31:54.573 --> 31:56.140
No, you are!

31:56.142 --> 31:57.708
Evicted? Fine!

31:57.710 --> 31:59.777
I don't want to live
in that cesspool anyway.

31:59.779 --> 32:02.413
Listen, I get
my security deposit back.

32:02.415 --> 32:04.415
Yes, I do.
Ye--

32:04.417 --> 32:07.317
That is not fair!
That is not fair!

32:07.319 --> 32:10.554
You have so many hairs
on your chin,

32:10.556 --> 32:12.756
Animal control
should've taken you away.

32:12.758 --> 32:14.758
[gasps]
that is very unladylike.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.393
You are disgusting!

32:16.395 --> 32:19.196
[hangs up phone]

32:29.240 --> 32:32.176
- What do you think
that was about?

32:32.178 --> 32:33.477
- David.

32:33.479 --> 32:35.079
I lost the scranton
white pages account.

32:35.081 --> 32:38.248
Do you have any idea
how much paper that is?

32:38.250 --> 32:40.184
And I'd just like
to point out

32:40.186 --> 32:41.218
I was mad at dwight.

32:41.220 --> 32:44.455
- We put the past
behind us, though, andy.

32:44.457 --> 32:46.557
- When have I told you
I hate you and this company?

32:46.559 --> 32:48.092
- Enough, andy.
Enough!

32:48.094 --> 32:51.762
- Just stop forgiving me, david.
Please?

32:51.764 --> 32:56.567
This is my last chance to honor
what is best inside myself.

32:56.569 --> 32:58.735
What if I took a dump
on your new car?

32:58.737 --> 32:59.870
- Oh, my god.

32:59.872 --> 33:01.839
- Eleanor roosevelt
once said,

33:01.841 --> 33:03.807
"the future belongs
to those

33:03.809 --> 33:06.877
Who believe in the beauty
of their dreams."

33:06.879 --> 33:08.879
[bleep]
I think she's right.

33:08.881 --> 33:11.181
I feel calm now.
- Get out!

33:11.183 --> 33:12.549
Get out!

33:12.551 --> 33:14.618
- I feel, like,
for the first time

33:14.620 --> 33:18.489
In a long time,
I'm doing the right thing.

33:20.158 --> 33:20.491
.

33:21.593 --> 33:22.826
- Andy.
- What are you doing?

33:22.828 --> 33:26.396
- Uh, heavy stuff
like books on the bottom.

33:26.398 --> 33:28.265
So it won't squash
my knickety-knacks on top.

33:28.267 --> 33:30.234
- Yeah, okay,
that's not what I mean.

33:30.236 --> 33:31.568
[sighs]

33:31.570 --> 33:34.538
You don't have to leave
because you said you would.

33:34.540 --> 33:38.709
Don't let pride ruin
your whole life.

33:38.711 --> 33:40.444
Okay?

33:40.446 --> 33:43.714
It's not worth it.

33:43.716 --> 33:45.382
- Wow.

33:45.384 --> 33:46.884
Angela.

33:46.886 --> 33:48.719
What we had was great,

33:48.721 --> 33:51.221
And, honestly, I think
about it a lot too...

33:51.223 --> 33:52.289
- Ugh.

33:52.291 --> 33:54.658
- But I just--
it's in the past.

33:54.660 --> 33:56.560
And I feel like we shouldn't...
- No, that's not--

33:56.562 --> 33:58.762
- Rehash--
- no, none--no, stop.

33:58.764 --> 34:01.665
It's just--
[groans]

34:01.667 --> 34:03.734
- Exactly.
- Okay.

34:03.736 --> 34:08.505
Well, have a good trip.

34:08.507 --> 34:10.941
Good luck, andy.

34:10.943 --> 34:12.743
- Thanks, angela.
You too.

34:12.745 --> 34:13.777
- Thanks.

34:13.779 --> 34:17.347
A-bridge a-burnt.

34:17.349 --> 34:19.416
No turning back now.

34:19.418 --> 34:22.686
Everybody, lorelei and I

34:22.688 --> 34:25.589
Would like to say thank you
and good-bye

34:25.591 --> 34:26.723
The only way
we know how.

34:26.725 --> 34:29.760
- Oh, good lord.
- Can't you just leave?

34:29.762 --> 34:32.829
- You know, andy, you could just
say a really nice good-bye.

34:32.831 --> 34:34.631
- Tuna, I'm a performer,

34:34.633 --> 34:37.601
And perform I shall.

34:37.603 --> 34:40.604
[playing <i>I will remember you]</i>

36:30.649 --> 36:32.316
Mm.
- Who knows?

36:32.318 --> 36:34.518
Maybe andy will make it.

36:34.520 --> 36:36.553
He's not terrible.
- Yeah.

36:36.555 --> 36:38.588
And people worse than him
make it all the time,

36:38.590 --> 36:39.890
Like lil' romeo.

36:39.892 --> 36:41.091
- No, he's good.

36:41.093 --> 36:43.694
- He <i>was</i> good.

36:52.003 --> 36:55.572
- Good night, kevin.
- Night, oscar.

37:07.852 --> 37:10.754
- Tents?

37:10.756 --> 37:12.756
Are you thinking
of going camping?

37:12.758 --> 37:14.658
I thought you found
nature vulgar.

37:14.660 --> 37:18.495
- Well, I've changed
my mind.

37:18.497 --> 37:21.365
- [whispering]
wait a minute, angela.

37:21.367 --> 37:23.633
You're not thinking
of living in a tent--

37:23.635 --> 37:28.105
- Oh, god, would you just mind
your own business?

37:28.107 --> 37:30.707
- Okay, listen.
I'm just gonna say this.

37:30.709 --> 37:32.709
You are not going to live
in a tent.

37:32.711 --> 37:37.114
- Oh, god.
- Come stay with me.

37:37.116 --> 37:39.516
- You don't want me
at your place.

37:39.518 --> 37:41.518
- I do. Yes.

37:41.520 --> 37:44.721
Not forever, but u-until
you get back on your feet,

37:44.723 --> 37:46.623
Which won't be long.

37:46.625 --> 37:48.658
It's the least I can do.

37:48.660 --> 37:51.728
- Well...

37:54.499 --> 37:56.166
- Separate bathrooms.

38:00.805 --> 38:03.740
- [exhales]

38:03.742 --> 38:06.777
Thank you.

38:06.779 --> 38:07.811
- You're welcome.

38:07.813 --> 38:09.780
Let's go get philip.

38:09.782 --> 38:12.649
Then, we'll get your stuff...
- Okay.

38:12.651 --> 38:14.184
- And you get the hell out
of that place.

38:14.186 --> 38:16.820
- Okay.

38:16.822 --> 38:18.722
- Are you allowed
to have pets?

38:18.724 --> 38:21.057
- Oh, angela.

38:21.059 --> 38:24.528
- Yesterday, I was just your
average, ordinary paper salesman

38:24.530 --> 38:28.198
With a farm and a bunch
of pipe dreams about beet fuel.

38:28.200 --> 38:33.603
Today, I leave here a regional
manager with a black belt.

38:33.605 --> 38:36.940
It really is amazing
how your life can change

38:36.942 --> 38:39.176
In one day.

38:39.178 --> 38:42.145
[exhales]

38:42.147 --> 38:43.513
- You talk
to wade and colin?

38:43.515 --> 38:44.748
- No, I just saw
I missed their call.

38:44.750 --> 38:48.852
- What kind of offer?
- A buyout.

38:48.854 --> 38:50.454
- What?
- We're in play, baby.

38:50.456 --> 38:51.988
- Oh, my god.
- We did it.

38:51.990 --> 38:53.690
- We did it!
- Ah, ha, ha, ha, ho!

38:53.692 --> 38:55.158
- Hey, and look.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.661
The buyers wanna make sure
it's not just a philly play.

38:57.663 --> 38:59.529
So get this.

38:59.531 --> 39:03.066
They're gonna pay for us
to go pitch out west.

39:03.068 --> 39:07.571
We talking spurs,
the jazz, cowboys.

39:07.573 --> 39:09.739
Blake griffin, baby.

39:09.741 --> 39:12.509
- Wow, that is...
- Yeah.

39:12.511 --> 39:13.910
- Wow.
- We did it.

39:13.912 --> 39:16.613
- Yeah, we did it.
- [laughs]

39:16.615 --> 39:18.615
Hey, how long--how long do
we think that's gonna take?

39:18.617 --> 39:21.718
- Wade said we could do the
whole country in three months.

39:21.720 --> 39:24.821
- Oh, man.

39:24.823 --> 39:27.491
Yeah, I can't do it.

39:27.493 --> 39:29.659
- Can't do what?

39:29.661 --> 39:33.663
- This, man.
I-I can't do this to pam.

39:33.665 --> 39:35.832
- No, no.
Jim, this is different.

39:35.834 --> 39:37.634
This is everything.
- [chuckles]

39:37.636 --> 39:39.903
I know.

39:39.905 --> 39:43.974
And I--
and I can't do it.

40:04.562 --> 40:08.632
- [exhales]

40:08.634 --> 40:12.269
So is your place all bachelor,
slobby, and gross?

40:12.271 --> 40:14.037
- Nope, it's neat
and tastefully appointed

40:14.039 --> 40:15.639
Like most gay men's homes.

40:15.641 --> 40:17.607
The stereotype holds up.

40:17.609 --> 40:21.645
- I wouldn't know.
I never lived with a gay guy.

40:21.647 --> 40:24.781
- Angela, you just were--

40:24.783 --> 40:27.317
- [sobbing]

40:27.319 --> 40:31.755
I love him.

40:31.757 --> 40:34.257
- I know.
- [sobs]

40:34.259 --> 40:35.792
- I understand
more than most,

40:35.794 --> 40:38.128
But we both have
to move on.

40:38.130 --> 40:41.131
You--you can't--c--

40:41.133 --> 40:44.801
- No, not the senator.

40:44.803 --> 40:46.903
I love dwight.
