<i>NARRATOR: Previously, on Stargate SG-1.</i>

00:02.892 --> 00:03.677
<i>MAN: Who's that?</i>

00:03.685 --> 00:04.962
<i>HARRIMAN:
Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell.</i>

00:04.986 --> 00:07.397
<i>VALA: The individual
I got this from assured me</i>

00:07.447 --> 00:11.204
<i>that the treasure it describes
is here on Earth.</i>

00:11.501 --> 00:13.684
These bracelets link us together.

00:13.825 --> 00:16.473
The tablet is mine, and I want
my fair share of what it leads to.

00:16.506 --> 00:17.397
Merlin?

00:17.407 --> 00:19.949
King Arthur and
the Knights of the Round Table Merlin?

00:19.976 --> 00:21.396
- Yes.
- Was an Ancient?

00:21.486 --> 00:24.813
<i>Welcome,
ye Knights of the Round Table.</i>

00:24.889 --> 00:28.357
<i>Prove ye worthy,
and all shall be revealed.</i>

00:28.393 --> 00:29.614
This has to be a test.

00:29.627 --> 00:32.962
I think we're supposed to arrange
the stones in some sort of order.

00:32.997 --> 00:36.504
What? We're already trapped in here.
How much worse can it get?

00:36.668 --> 00:38.800
Do you ever get a bad feeling
about something?

00:41.873 --> 00:44.052
Think!
You are the expert on all things Ancient.

00:44.075 --> 00:45.164
You didn't care
about that two minutes ago.

00:45.176 --> 00:46.331
"Let's try this pot.
How about this one?"

00:46.344 --> 00:47.499
- So think!
- I'm thinking!

00:47.512 --> 00:48.799
Sorry, could you possibly think
a little bit faster?

00:48.813 --> 00:51.058
- The universe is infinite.
- No doubt it's deliberately ironic

00:51.082 --> 00:52.534
that we're in an
ever-decreasing space.

00:52.550 --> 00:53.639
It's the second part
of an ancient proverb,

00:53.651 --> 00:55.038
there is only one truth,
the universe is infinite.

00:55.053 --> 00:56.307
- How does that help us?
- There's only one truth,

00:56.321 --> 00:58.797
- this pot says the treasure is in this pot.
- It's not in either of them.

00:58.823 --> 01:01.894
I know. We did it wrong.
So we have to see if we can do it again.

01:01.926 --> 01:03.544
There is only one truth.
The universe is infinite.

01:03.561 --> 01:06.302
Therefore the statement about the
treasure being in this pot has to be false.

01:06.331 --> 01:08.335
So the treasure must be in...

01:49.357 --> 01:53.122
- Hey, we got a little problem in here!
- What's the puzzle?

01:53.161 --> 01:56.034
There's eight stones with symbols
on them and some Ancient writing.

01:56.064 --> 01:57.153
I think it is...

01:57.165 --> 02:00.038
- Describe the writing!
- "U" with a square over it.

02:00.068 --> 02:02.511
Chair with a square,
upside down backwards "L."

02:02.537 --> 02:04.980
Call that seven.
Squares unevenly stacked,

02:05.006 --> 02:08.275
that chair thing again,
big "N" and sad face.

02:08.309 --> 02:10.652
Reflect. It means...
It means reflect.

02:10.678 --> 02:13.617
- Reflect?
- Reflect on the Eightfold Path.

02:13.648 --> 02:16.289
Buddhism teaches an Eightfold Path
to enlightenment.

02:16.317 --> 02:19.058
Yeah, that tells me exactly nothing!

02:19.087 --> 02:20.737
I'm sorry I can't help

02:20.755 --> 02:23.396
if I can't see the symbols on the stones
you're supposed to put in order.

02:23.424 --> 02:25.504
Reflect on the Eightfold.

02:25.526 --> 02:27.832
Reflect on the Eight...

02:32.967 --> 02:34.148
Four.

02:39.574 --> 02:40.720
Six.

02:49.417 --> 02:50.702
Teal'c!

02:52.870 --> 02:56.371
Look, I didn't hear any screaming
or squishing sounds, so...

03:03.281 --> 03:04.370
<i>JACKSON: You did it.</i>

03:04.382 --> 03:06.032
Yeah. Thanks.

03:06.050 --> 03:10.467
The symbols were actually the numbers
one through eight and their mirror image.

03:15.626 --> 03:16.914
All right.

03:16.928 --> 03:20.150
We passed the test,
so this should work.

03:51.429 --> 03:54.071
I should have known
it wouldn't be that easy.

05:05.837 --> 05:07.087
Weird.

05:12.877 --> 05:16.113
- You... You done this before?
- Fight a knight in armor?

05:16.147 --> 05:18.260
- No, can't say that I have.
- Well, you're doing good.

05:18.282 --> 05:20.797
Took a little fencing in college.

(METALLIC GRATING)

05:30.628 --> 05:33.108
Okay, I could use a little help.

05:37.435 --> 05:39.184
It appears to be a hologram.

05:39.203 --> 05:40.766
A hologram?

05:40.905 --> 05:42.330
(GRUNTING)

05:44.075 --> 05:47.367
- Jeez.
- I don't think it actually cut you.

05:47.678 --> 05:49.752
Well, it hurt like hell.

05:55.987 --> 05:58.628
I don't know.
I don't think he's actually that good.

05:58.656 --> 06:01.298
Okay, so I flunked fencing.

06:09.800 --> 06:12.140
Colonel Mitchell, your sword.

06:26.350 --> 06:30.733
- Okay, that thing is going to kill him.
- Everybody, get to the rings!

06:41.799 --> 06:43.846
Okay, that's enough for today.

06:43.868 --> 06:45.629
No. I can do this.

06:48.439 --> 06:50.130
(METALLIC GRATING)

07:16.801 --> 07:18.399
Oh, come on.

07:20.438 --> 07:22.269
That's gotta be it.

07:30.581 --> 07:33.165
I don't understand.
We solved the riddles.

07:33.451 --> 07:38.170
Well, he solved one and he solved one
and he won the fight.

07:39.757 --> 07:41.518
And what? Nothing?

07:41.892 --> 07:43.774
But you're the only one
who defeated the knight.

07:43.794 --> 07:47.593
That sword was obviously designed to
sense whoever pulled it from the stone.

07:47.632 --> 07:49.613
What if there's sensors detecting us?

07:49.634 --> 07:51.945
Are you suggesting
that we should leave?

07:51.969 --> 07:53.695
It's worth a try.

07:55.439 --> 07:56.864
All right.

07:58.776 --> 08:00.130

(RUMBLING)

08:16.961 --> 08:18.617
(SCREAMING)

08:27.672 --> 08:30.049
- What happened?
- The whole place is collapsing.

08:30.074 --> 08:32.623
We must have done something wrong.

08:35.011 --> 08:36.773
What did you take?

08:36.981 --> 08:38.985
- What?
- Truth of spirit.

08:39.082 --> 08:42.304
- I resent...
- Truth of spirit. What'd you take?

10:05.302 --> 10:06.656
Worth it.

10:17.081 --> 10:20.547
We are not going to let her keep that,
are we?

10:24.588 --> 10:26.314
- No.
- Good.

10:27.258 --> 10:30.725
Well, that figures.
A roomful of gold and jewels

10:30.761 --> 10:33.647
and Dr. Daniel Jackson
finds the one book.

10:36.434 --> 10:38.084
So, what's it about?

10:38.102 --> 10:41.533
Oh, actually, it's a story.
It's written like fiction.

10:43.674 --> 10:45.160
Once upon a time...

10:45.176 --> 10:47.718
"Once upon a time
there was a race of people

10:47.745 --> 10:50.089
"that went on a great journey
through space.

10:50.114 --> 10:52.723
"Across the universe.
They were called the Altera.

10:52.750 --> 10:56.622
"After much time,"
and I think this means thousands of years,

10:56.921 --> 11:00.654
"they found a great belt of stars."

11:01.158 --> 11:03.707
And they lived happily ever after.

11:09.633 --> 11:11.680
Have you found something,
Daniel Jackson?

11:11.702 --> 11:15.136
It says that the Alterans
named their new home Avalon

11:15.172 --> 11:17.919
and that they built many Astria Porta.

11:19.310 --> 11:21.192
- Stargates.
- Yes.

11:21.212 --> 11:23.727
The Ancients built the Stargates.

11:25.149 --> 11:28.352
Well, it stands to reason that
they weren't always called the Ancients.

11:28.385 --> 11:30.928
<i>MITCHELL: What do you care?
You got your treasure.</i>

11:30.955 --> 11:33.100
Let's see what's of more value.

11:33.123 --> 11:37.100
A few gold trinkets that apparently
I won't be allowed to keep

11:37.728 --> 11:40.950
or previously undiscovered secrets

11:41.131 --> 11:43.205
about the gate builders,

11:43.334 --> 11:46.661
the most powerful race
to ever inhabit the galaxy.

11:47.771 --> 11:50.484
And you realize
what this could mean?

11:52.576 --> 11:56.803
Well, we've always presumed
that the Ancients

11:56.847 --> 12:00.083
were the first evolution of humans
in this galaxy.

12:00.117 --> 12:01.611
But this...

12:02.219 --> 12:06.056
This is the first evidence
suggesting they came here

12:06.156 --> 12:08.831
- long ago from somewhere far, far away.
- Yes.

12:08.859 --> 12:10.585
Colonel Mitchell.

12:28.746 --> 12:31.771
One of these things
is not like the others.

12:37.154 --> 12:39.466
It's much, much more than that.

12:39.490 --> 12:42.065
We know the Ancients left their galaxy
for Pegasus and returned later

12:42.092 --> 12:44.635
when they lost the war to the Wraith.
But what happened to them?

12:44.662 --> 12:46.180
I thought they ascended.

12:46.196 --> 12:48.970
Some did that we know,
but what if the others went home?

12:48.999 --> 12:51.377
Even if they didn't, the book I read
suggested that the Alterans

12:51.402 --> 12:54.175
- left a civilization behind.
- And your point is?

12:54.204 --> 12:56.285
My point is that
we haven't met a single living Ancient

12:56.307 --> 12:57.891
who was willing
to share their knowledge freely with us

12:57.908 --> 13:00.286
and there could be an entire
advanced civilization of them out there

13:00.311 --> 13:01.796
somewhere in another galaxy.

13:01.812 --> 13:03.397
Isn't that why we're doing this,
all of this?

13:03.414 --> 13:04.866
The Stargate program, the budget?

13:04.882 --> 13:07.259
So we can go out and meet new races,
gather advanced technology,

13:07.284 --> 13:09.265
possibly learn about ourselves
in the process?

13:09.286 --> 13:11.662
Oh, come on.
You do it to meet women.

13:12.056 --> 13:13.409
She has a point, sir.

13:13.424 --> 13:16.751
I've been thinking I need to get out
on an off-world mission or two.

13:16.994 --> 13:19.371
Yeah. Just to get the feel for it.

13:19.396 --> 13:22.335
"Always do everything you ask
of those you command."

13:22.366 --> 13:23.521
Patton.

13:23.534 --> 13:25.382
- Very good.
- Good movie.

13:25.402 --> 13:27.813
Laugh if you want to,
but I believe finding these Alterans

13:27.838 --> 13:30.612
and where they came from should be
our top priority from this point forward.

13:30.641 --> 13:32.721
They are the gate builders.

13:32.743 --> 13:36.650
Nobody's laughing, Dr. Jackson.
The universe is a big place.

13:37.014 --> 13:41.431
Tell me where they are and how
to get there, and I'll order you to go.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.301
No, no, I'm not saying
this is going to be easy.

13:45.322 --> 13:46.940
I mean,
if they're from a distant galaxy,

13:46.957 --> 13:48.310
our network of Stargates
might not even connect.

13:48.325 --> 13:49.381
And even if it does,

13:49.393 --> 13:51.440
we know the massive power requirements
necessary to dial Pegasus

13:51.462 --> 13:53.542
and they're relatively close
in intergalactic terms.

13:53.564 --> 13:54.653
But on the bright side,

13:54.665 --> 13:56.547
according to the text we found
in the Glastonbury cavern,

13:56.567 --> 13:58.118
the Ancient device we discovered
may be capable

13:58.135 --> 14:00.281
of intergalactic communication.

14:00.304 --> 14:03.771
Thank you, Dr. Jackson.
I'm sure you'll keep me posted.

14:03.807 --> 14:05.568
- Colonel.
- General.

14:08.879 --> 14:11.463
He has no idea what you just said.

14:12.549 --> 14:15.841
Someone wanna tell me
why she's still on my base?

14:16.820 --> 14:18.894
And, yes, I did.

14:26.497 --> 14:28.837
Well, I think it's incredible.

14:34.104 --> 14:37.671
The Jaffa of the Onac Ka equal as many
as all the other regional coalitions.

14:37.708 --> 14:40.317
- And they strongly support Gerak.
- Of this I am aware.

14:40.344 --> 14:43.746
If we allow them even one more vote
based on unconfirmed military strength,

14:43.781 --> 14:45.993
the Council will be in Gerak's hands.

14:46.016 --> 14:48.729
- Until proper inspections...
- Rak'nor!

14:48.919 --> 14:51.263
I'm sorry.
We are all working very hard.

14:51.288 --> 14:53.335
It just seems as though
Gerak is winning.

14:53.357 --> 14:55.503
Bra'tac and Ryac
are negotiating with coalitions

14:55.526 --> 14:57.308
who have yet to declare
their allegiance.

14:57.327 --> 14:59.936
I did not fight for
the freedom of all Jaffa

14:59.963 --> 15:02.672
only to have it corrupted
by a few power-hungry individuals.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.125
Nor did I.

15:04.835 --> 15:05.990
I just do not understand

15:06.003 --> 15:10.560
why you've chosen to spend so much time
with the Tau'ri at such a critical stage.

15:11.375 --> 15:15.800
My friends from the Tau'ri are largely
responsible for the Jaffa being free.

15:15.846 --> 15:19.446
And as thanks, they have been treated
with mistrust and disrespect.

15:19.483 --> 15:21.860
Until all Jaffa see
that the old ways are not the future,

15:21.885 --> 15:24.593
I will do whatever I need to do
to enlighten them.

15:24.621 --> 15:26.569
And how does chasing Ancient history
do that?

15:26.590 --> 15:30.024
Ancient knowledge is what defeated
the Goa'uld and the Replicators.

15:30.060 --> 15:34.106
And I believe that one day
it will unite the Jaffa in a nation of peace.

15:34.698 --> 15:36.389
I will prove it.

15:39.303 --> 15:40.728
I hope so.

15:43.574 --> 15:45.654
I have been around the galaxy
long enough to know

15:45.676 --> 15:46.963
that knowledge is power.

15:46.977 --> 15:49.553
And understanding the technology
that was left behind by the Ancients

15:49.580 --> 15:50.933
is the most powerful knowledge around.

15:50.948 --> 15:53.656
And if you think I'm gonna stay linked
with you for the rest of my natural...

15:53.684 --> 15:58.647
Focus. Maybe we should focus
on the task at hand.

16:00.023 --> 16:02.190
(CLEARING THROAT) Yeah. Well,

16:02.793 --> 16:05.170
the device obviously has a power source

16:05.195 --> 16:07.977
and I don't think it's been depleted.

16:08.065 --> 16:10.442
Okay, when I read
this was a communication device

16:10.467 --> 16:14.034
I realized the shape
of these recess spaces looked familiar.

16:14.071 --> 16:17.076
These stones are actually an Ancient form
of communication device

16:17.107 --> 16:20.442
that links the users psychically, allowing
them to see through each other's eyes.

16:20.477 --> 16:24.407
It appears that they're actually meant to
be used in conjunction with this terminal.

16:24.448 --> 16:26.197
So what happens
when you attach the stones?

16:26.216 --> 16:28.792
- We're going to find out.
- These stones were originally set

16:28.819 --> 16:31.196
for General O'Neill and
one Joe Spencer.

16:31.221 --> 16:33.632
- Barber from Indiana.
- Yeah, weird guy.

16:34.158 --> 16:35.511
I read the file.

16:35.526 --> 16:37.473
Well, anyway,
after a lot of tedious,

16:37.494 --> 16:40.565
although I must say
ultimately very brilliant work

16:40.597 --> 16:41.686
if I do say so myself,

16:41.698 --> 16:43.547
I was able to reset the stones.

16:43.567 --> 16:46.043
Don't they have to be activated by
someone with the Ancient gene?

16:46.069 --> 16:47.159
Same file.

16:47.171 --> 16:48.888
Well, that's what we thought at first,

16:48.906 --> 16:50.887
but no,
like a lot of Ancient technology

16:50.908 --> 16:53.053
the stones actually
just need to be initialized.

16:53.076 --> 16:55.123
By someone with the gene?
That's a guess.

16:55.145 --> 16:56.498
No, you're right.

16:56.513 --> 16:58.593
Which these obviously have been.

16:58.615 --> 17:01.851
So any one of us
can take the pony ride.

17:01.885 --> 17:03.536
Yeah, and I figured
that was gonna be me.

17:03.554 --> 17:06.262
I mean, I did miss the Daedalus
for this, so...

17:06.290 --> 17:08.535
You're gonna dine out
on that for a while?

17:08.559 --> 17:10.276
Yeah, yeah.
Like you wouldn't believe.

17:10.294 --> 17:12.209
Well, no one's gonna make an argument
against that.

17:12.229 --> 17:14.838
You are the world's "foremost" expert
on the Ancients.

17:14.865 --> 17:17.903
- But we got two stones.
- Yes, and this one's mine.

17:17.935 --> 17:19.288
Thank you.

17:19.303 --> 17:21.151
Excuse me.
How do you figure that?

17:21.171 --> 17:22.987
Well, Daniel and I are linked.

17:23.006 --> 17:25.251
I'll just point out for the record,
we don't have to be.

17:25.275 --> 17:27.520
He's only guessing that this device
is for communication.

17:27.544 --> 17:29.426
But what if it's a transporter of some kind

17:29.446 --> 17:31.526
and he gets whisked away
and can't get back?

17:31.548 --> 17:34.058
Actually, we have done
a fair bit of research on this device

17:34.084 --> 17:36.390
and I can say with absolute...

17:36.854 --> 17:39.230
Relative certainty...

17:40.057 --> 17:42.236
Look, we have studied devices like this
for years.

17:42.259 --> 17:45.132
And at some point, ultimately,
you just have to turn it on.

17:45.162 --> 17:47.109
- I'm gonna give it a try.
- Where he goes, I go.

17:47.130 --> 17:48.649
- I'm not going anywhere.
- So he thinks.

17:48.665 --> 17:49.919
Communication device.

17:49.933 --> 17:52.641
I'm going to watch
from the observation room.

17:52.669 --> 17:54.673
All right. Good luck.

17:56.340 --> 17:58.507
So, what do we do?

17:59.109 --> 18:02.313
Well, I'm guessing, we just put these
two stones in any two of these spots.

18:02.346 --> 18:03.666
Any two?

18:03.780 --> 18:07.652
Well, there aren't any markings
to indicate otherwise. So, any two.

18:09.052 --> 18:10.337
And...

18:20.564 --> 18:22.325
Med Team to Science Lab One.

18:29.506 --> 18:31.069
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

18:35.579 --> 18:38.639
Hello. Please don't be afraid.

18:38.849 --> 18:41.016
My name is Daniel Jackson.

18:41.952 --> 18:44.119
It's me. Vala.

18:44.488 --> 18:45.669
Okay.

18:46.290 --> 18:48.051
Not a transporter.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.723
Where are we?

18:54.264 --> 18:55.827
I don't know.

19:10.113 --> 19:12.245
But I think we're in them.

19:24.561 --> 19:26.410
<i>LAM: Blood pressure
and heart rate are normal.</i>

19:26.430 --> 19:27.915
Pupils are slightly dilated.

19:27.931 --> 19:30.473
Now, we're sure
this is because of the device?

19:30.500 --> 19:33.605
They also passed out before when they
were separated because of the bracelets.

19:33.637 --> 19:38.228
The reaction was virtually instantaneous
after the device was activated.

19:38.275 --> 19:41.379
Anyway, there's no
discernible energy rays

19:41.411 --> 19:44.633
and no measurable radiation
being emitted, so...

19:45.482 --> 19:48.403
And we've found no contagions.
All right.

19:50.554 --> 19:52.073
I wanna get an EEG going,

19:52.089 --> 19:55.160
but my first impression here
is that they're in some kind of sleep state.

19:55.192 --> 19:57.833
Maybe we should disconnect
the stones.

19:57.861 --> 20:01.263
For all we know,
this could be perfectly normal.

20:01.298 --> 20:03.675
I mean, this could be the way
the device actually works.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.120
And could you give me
some time here

20:05.135 --> 20:07.050
before we go messing around
with that thing anymore.

20:07.070 --> 20:09.414
I wouldn't call it messing around.

20:09.439 --> 20:14.158
Look, for all we know, disconnecting the
stones could put them in further jeopardy.

20:16.747 --> 20:18.983
So how are things on Dakara?

20:19.216 --> 20:21.185
About as well as here.

20:22.419 --> 20:23.982
I don't understand.

20:24.654 --> 20:27.462
This is an odd communication device.

20:27.491 --> 20:29.769
I mean, I can't talk
to this poor woman.

20:29.793 --> 20:35.078
I have no access to her mind,
her thoughts, her memories.

20:35.132 --> 20:38.500
I'm just inside of her,
looking out through her eyes.

20:38.535 --> 20:40.351
Yeah. Jack and Joe Spencer
described the experience

20:40.370 --> 20:42.979
as having visions of what was happening
to the other.

20:43.006 --> 20:45.483
Were they ever in total control
of each other's bodies?

20:45.509 --> 20:47.357
No. But they weren't using the stones

20:47.377 --> 20:49.689
in conjunction
with the Ancient terminal either.

20:49.713 --> 20:51.462
It's possible
it was meant to work this way

20:51.481 --> 20:53.330
so that we can
communicate with others

20:53.350 --> 20:55.761
without intruding on the minds
of those we're connected to.

20:55.786 --> 20:58.428
They're just temporary transmitters.

20:59.723 --> 21:02.678
Do you think
we're actually in another galaxy?

21:02.859 --> 21:04.422
I don't know.

21:06.263 --> 21:08.940
- Why these people?
- I don't know.

21:10.133 --> 21:13.761
Well, maybe it's just me,
but this house,

21:14.571 --> 21:17.213
these clothes...

21:20.343 --> 21:23.811
We don't look
the way I'd expect the Ancients to look.

21:23.847 --> 21:24.958
No.

21:25.215 --> 21:28.507
- What do you suppose their names are?
- Harrid and Sallis.

21:28.718 --> 21:30.436
How do you know that?

21:30.454 --> 21:32.038
Well, because it...

21:32.055 --> 21:34.024
It says so right here.

21:34.991 --> 21:38.326
It says, "This is the home"

21:38.361 --> 21:40.277
"of Harrid and Sallis Cicera."

21:40.297 --> 21:42.608
- Wait, I missed that. You mumbled it.
- No, I didn't.

21:42.632 --> 21:44.679
Well, you said something
that I couldn't understand.

21:44.701 --> 21:46.781
Well, I didn't say it because
I don't really know what it means.

21:46.803 --> 21:48.850
So I don't want to say it out loud
'cause I know what it means.

21:48.872 --> 21:51.387
- Well, go on.
- Nuptial. It means nuptial.

21:52.209 --> 21:54.549
- As in we're...
- Married. Yeah.

21:56.279 --> 21:57.970
Let's go look outside.

22:07.357 --> 22:09.239
Not quite what I imagined

22:09.259 --> 22:12.690
when I pictured a civilization
of gate builders.

22:13.997 --> 22:15.108
No.

22:15.765 --> 22:17.647
Something tells me
this is not the same people

22:17.667 --> 22:21.234
who built a spaceship
capable of traveling across the universe.

22:21.271 --> 22:23.611
Above the sun. Harrid, Sallis.

22:25.008 --> 22:26.189
What?

22:27.410 --> 22:29.855
I think that means good morning.

22:33.250 --> 22:35.150
Above the sun to you!

22:36.219 --> 22:39.554
- Above the sun?
- I think he's speaking Ancient.

22:39.589 --> 22:42.000
I think the communicator
is translating for us.

22:42.025 --> 22:45.657
- I couldn't read the sign.
- Maybe it only works for spoken language.

22:45.695 --> 22:47.699
See you at prostration.

22:48.265 --> 22:51.360
- Prostration it is!
- Prostration it is.

22:53.870 --> 22:56.489
So, what do you want to do, Harrid?

22:56.540 --> 22:59.762
- Or is it Sallis?
- People are starting to stare.

22:59.910 --> 23:02.529
Should we walk about
and try to play along?

23:10.353 --> 23:12.863
<i>JACKSON: Nope.
Not what I was expecting at all.</i>

23:12.889 --> 23:14.487
<i>VALA: Me neither.</i>

23:15.358 --> 23:18.198
On the bright side, I think
he was looking at me when he said Harrid.

23:18.228 --> 23:21.253
Please.
He was staring at me the whole time.

23:26.770 --> 23:28.333
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

23:28.805 --> 23:30.566
Hey. Come in.

23:31.408 --> 23:36.336
Now, I can't decide if
I like the desk here.

23:36.980 --> 23:39.831
Where else are you gonna put it?
Out in the hall?

23:41.651 --> 23:43.071
Daniel and Vala are stable.

23:43.086 --> 23:45.166
Based on rapid eye movements
and brainwave patterns,

23:45.188 --> 23:47.909
I'm guessing it's actually some kind of
induced dream-like condition.

23:47.924 --> 23:52.878
Dr. Jackson believes the device was used
for long-range communication.

23:52.929 --> 23:54.976
Is it possible
that's what they're doing?

23:54.998 --> 23:58.255
Talking to someone
somewhere out there?

23:58.735 --> 24:00.980
- I don't know.
- I'm heading to the mess.

24:01.004 --> 24:03.910
I'm good, thanks.
I should get back to Daniel and Vala.

24:03.940 --> 24:06.351
Of course. Just keep me posted.

24:08.445 --> 24:09.765
Carolyn?

24:12.015 --> 24:15.237
You seem to be settling in okay.

24:18.255 --> 24:22.370
I don't know if I'll ever get
used to this place. It's pretty...

24:24.661 --> 24:26.770
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:27.063 --> 24:32.051
And working for you makes this whole
thing just that much more bizarre.

24:32.102 --> 24:34.380
Well, you didn't have to take the job,
you know.

24:34.404 --> 24:36.385
Are you kidding, who could refuse it?

24:36.406 --> 24:40.006
Besides, at the time, General O'Neill
didn't tell me you'd be my boss.

24:40.043 --> 24:41.628
He's funny that way.

24:41.645 --> 24:43.371
(MOCKING)

24:43.680 --> 24:46.123
By the way,
the desk looks fine the way it is.

24:46.149 --> 24:47.767
- Really?
- You never were happy

24:47.784 --> 24:49.858
with anything the way it was.

24:55.225 --> 24:57.844
All hallow the Ori.

25:03.133 --> 25:05.114
On their great power

25:05.135 --> 25:08.462
we shall meditate herein this day.

25:13.243 --> 25:14.597
Prostration it is.

25:27.757 --> 25:29.276
(WHISPERING) We must meet.

25:29.292 --> 25:32.283
By the portico of light
at the hour of bly.

25:32.562 --> 25:35.784
- Speak not.
<i>- CHIEF: All greatness that is the Ori.</i>

25:37.033 --> 25:40.071
You guide us and give meaning
to our daily lives.

25:40.103 --> 25:42.780
We beseech you, give us strength.

25:43.373 --> 25:46.014
<i>ALL: All hallow the Ori.</i>

25:46.042 --> 25:49.334

25:49.412 --> 25:52.843
<i>All hallow the Ori.</i>

25:57.687 --> 25:59.008
Well, that was fun.

25:59.022 --> 26:01.467
Six hours of prostration.

26:04.661 --> 26:07.633
Why don't we just tell someone
who we are

26:07.664 --> 26:10.503
and what's going on? I mean, isn't that
the whole point to this, to communicate?

26:10.533 --> 26:12.382
I don't think these people
are gonna entirely understand.

26:12.402 --> 26:14.746
Hey, did you hear what the guy said
when we first came to the service?

26:14.771 --> 26:17.578
- Something about meeting.
- The portico of light on the hour of bly.

26:17.607 --> 26:20.645
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I have no idea.

26:20.677 --> 26:23.192
- What are you looking for?
- I don't know.

26:23.880 --> 26:27.512
Some reason as to why we're in these
particular people, these specific bodies.

26:27.550 --> 26:29.821
I mean, it can't be totally random.

26:31.221 --> 26:34.003
Well, I have a more pressing question.

26:36.593 --> 26:41.556
Do you have any idea
how we're supposed to detach from them?

26:44.567 --> 26:48.173
No. That's another thing
that's got me worried. Have you tried?

26:49.139 --> 26:50.459
Nothing.

26:51.441 --> 26:55.383
I mean, it doesn't seem to be something
I can just will to make happen.

27:03.019 --> 27:05.727
Maybe it's about removing the stones
from the device on Earth.

27:05.755 --> 27:08.232
Yeah, unfortunately, we can't tell the
people on Earth that we need them

27:08.258 --> 27:09.312
to remove them.

27:09.324 --> 27:11.934
I mean, we'll just have to wait for them
to figure that out for themselves.

27:11.961 --> 27:14.708
Maybe they have already
and it had no effect.

27:15.398 --> 27:18.180
I'm just gonna rule out that possibility.

27:20.870 --> 27:24.127
Do you think
these people are in our bodies?

27:25.141 --> 27:26.990
I don't know. I mean...

27:27.010 --> 27:30.105
This can't be how the technology
is supposed to work.

27:32.882 --> 27:34.028
Hey.

27:35.018 --> 27:37.858
Yeah. It's the book that some of the
villagers were walking around with.

27:37.887 --> 27:39.787
It says on the front,

27:39.889 --> 27:43.224
"The Book of Origins.
Blessed are the Ori."

27:43.259 --> 27:45.207
I think you should take a look at it.

27:45.228 --> 27:48.894
Oh, I think I've seen enough.
I mean, prostration for six hours.

27:48.932 --> 27:50.658
Give us strength.

27:52.101 --> 27:55.569
- You know, it's all very clear.
- I think you'd find it really interesting.

27:55.605 --> 27:57.619
Yeah? When did you start being able
to read Ancient?

27:57.640 --> 27:58.960
I can't.

27:59.275 --> 28:03.008
But this looked familiar.

28:13.690 --> 28:15.288
(BANGING ON DOOR)

28:24.234 --> 28:25.752
Thank those full of value.

28:25.768 --> 28:27.419
I was worried
when you did not meet me.

28:27.437 --> 28:30.375
- Yes. Sorry about that.
- Why did you not meet me?

28:30.406 --> 28:33.907
Why are you not sharing leaves
with the Administrator's wife?

28:34.277 --> 28:36.896
I forgot.

28:37.113 --> 28:40.250
We are already suspected.
We must not alter our behavior.

28:40.283 --> 28:42.825
- Suspected of what?
- Harrid, what ails you?

28:42.852 --> 28:45.263
Did I not know better,
I'd fear you're trying to entrap me.

28:45.288 --> 28:48.062
- No. I wouldn't dream of trying to...
- Entrap you? How?

28:48.091 --> 28:50.942
- Stop this. Please.
- Okay, you know what?

28:53.329 --> 28:56.424
Please. Would you...
Would you sit?

29:01.938 --> 29:03.397
Go with me.

29:10.747 --> 29:14.689
My name is Daniel Jackson
and I am inside the mind of Harrid.

29:15.718 --> 29:20.044
I am able to speak through him
by use of a communication technology

29:20.089 --> 29:24.506
that we believe was first constructed
and used by a race known as the Alterans.

29:27.597 --> 29:29.601
And I'm Vala Mal Doran.

29:35.471 --> 29:37.069
How you doing?

29:37.206 --> 29:40.869
By the stars. Forgive me. I am Fannis.

29:44.581 --> 29:46.132
Nice to meet you.

29:46.149 --> 29:49.319
- We're from a place called Earth.
- Can I speak with Harrid?

29:49.352 --> 29:53.491
No. His consciousness appears to be
suppressed so long as we're connected.

29:53.957 --> 29:56.962
Harrid always suspected the stones
were a means of communication.

29:56.993 --> 29:59.125
You know about the stones?

30:02.632 --> 30:05.657
We are curators.
Investigators of the past.

30:05.935 --> 30:08.477
The stones were discovered
some time ago in what we believe

30:08.504 --> 30:11.443
are the remains of an ancestral
burial ground not far from here.

30:11.474 --> 30:14.876
- Why are you hiding them?
- Such investigation is sacrilege.

30:14.911 --> 30:16.793
You're not allowed to investigate
your own history?

30:16.813 --> 30:18.760
If such a history contradicts
The Book of Origin.

30:18.781 --> 30:20.472
You're heretics.

30:21.384 --> 30:23.133
We have uncovered evidence

30:23.152 --> 30:27.673
that we believe proves a race of humans
predates our supposed creation by the Ori.

30:29.258 --> 30:31.669
Excuse me. Daniel.

30:33.029 --> 30:35.509
What if these gods, the Ori,

30:36.132 --> 30:38.872
are the people left behind
by the Alterans?

30:38.901 --> 30:41.642
- You think they ascended?
- It's possible.

30:41.671 --> 30:43.784
The Alterans left a long,
long time ago.

30:43.806 --> 30:47.968
And what we know of the Ancients,
they learned to evolve and ascend.

30:48.011 --> 30:50.487
What if the people who remained here
did, too?

30:50.513 --> 30:52.791
That would make these people
subsequent evolution of humans,

30:52.815 --> 30:54.598
which is apparently
what happened in our galaxy

30:54.617 --> 30:56.334
after the Ancients we know ascended.

30:56.352 --> 31:00.117
And it would explain why they're not
as advanced as we might expect.

31:00.156 --> 31:02.236
No, but the religion
doesn't fit the profile.

31:02.258 --> 31:04.570
The ascended beings I know
don't pose as gods.

31:04.594 --> 31:06.641
I mean, that's the one explicit rule
that they do follow

31:06.663 --> 31:09.205
is that they don't meddle in the affairs
of the lower planes of existence.

31:09.232 --> 31:12.567
The Ori are not posing.
We do not doubt their power.

31:12.602 --> 31:14.748
Just their word and intention.

31:14.771 --> 31:18.799
The power is as real as the strength
and belief in all followers.

31:18.841 --> 31:21.351
You are late for leaves
with the Administrator's wife.

31:21.377 --> 31:24.779
- Sallis and she are acquaintances.
- So, what should I do?

31:24.814 --> 31:27.027
Can you not disconnect
and allow Sallis to return?

31:27.050 --> 31:29.530
No. Apparently, we can't do that.

31:30.486 --> 31:34.114
Then you must pose as Sallis,
or we will be discovered.

31:38.528 --> 31:40.126
I can do that.

31:57.113 --> 31:59.259
The Council has already taken respite.

31:59.282 --> 32:02.470
The vote was quick.
I delivered yours by proxy.

32:03.319 --> 32:06.192
Gerak's motion was resolved
by a slim majority.

32:06.222 --> 32:09.073
The Jaffa will be ruled
by High Council.

32:09.358 --> 32:12.628
Votes will be attributed
to the various coalition representatives

32:12.662 --> 32:14.794
based on military assets.

32:15.298 --> 32:19.031
- Making Gerak...
- The new leader of the Jaffa Nation.

32:25.575 --> 32:28.937
You said the Ori may have ascended.
What does that mean?

32:29.512 --> 32:30.667
(SIGHING)

32:30.680 --> 32:32.511
Where we come from,

32:32.582 --> 32:36.776
some people who used to look a lot like us
evolved physically and mentally so much

32:36.819 --> 32:39.956
that they found a way
to shed their physical bodies

32:39.989 --> 32:43.652
and live as energy
on another higher plane of existence.

32:43.826 --> 32:46.039
Some called it enlightenment

32:46.062 --> 32:48.373
and came with it a much greater
understanding of the universe

32:48.397 --> 32:49.784
and all its knowledge.

32:49.799 --> 32:51.548
Now, this happened a long time ago.

32:51.567 --> 32:54.704
And I believe that those people
may have originally come from here.

32:54.737 --> 32:56.916
And those ascended beings,
as you call them,

32:56.939 --> 32:58.887
do not guide you
and ask that you worship them?

32:58.908 --> 33:01.319
No.
In fact, they believe so strongly in free will

33:01.344 --> 33:03.589
that they would not intervene
and use their knowledge

33:03.613 --> 33:05.658
even if that meant the destruction
of an entire galaxy

33:05.680 --> 33:06.935
full of us regular, old humans.

33:06.949 --> 33:11.144
- Such is not the case with the Ori.
- Yes. So they ask that you worship them

33:11.187 --> 33:13.927
and yet conceal
the truth of your existence from you.

33:13.956 --> 33:15.647
That is not all.

33:16.526 --> 33:17.780
What are you gonna do?

33:17.794 --> 33:20.601
We're gathering as much evidence
as we can.

33:20.630 --> 33:24.027
Our hope is that one day
we will have enough proof

33:24.133 --> 33:26.808
to convince
even the most devout believers.

33:26.836 --> 33:28.916
In the meantime, we meet in secret

33:28.938 --> 33:31.547
and share with those we trust
what we have learned.

33:31.574 --> 33:33.985
We keep hidden those artifacts
which prove our claims

33:34.010 --> 33:37.907
- in case one or more of us are discovered.
- How many of you are there?

33:37.947 --> 33:40.358
A few. Our numbers are growing.

33:41.517 --> 33:43.696
Some believe the fact
that we have not yet been discovered

33:43.719 --> 33:48.032
is further proof that the Ori are not
all-powerful and all-knowing.

33:48.391 --> 33:51.032
Others wonder if they are
just giving us the opportunity

33:51.060 --> 33:53.834
to see the error
of our ways and repent.

33:53.863 --> 33:55.485
(PEOPLE CHANTING)

33:59.969 --> 34:02.078
Crowd gathers at the Ara.

34:06.108 --> 34:07.706
That's an altar?

34:08.311 --> 34:10.443
I cannot be seen with you.

34:15.117 --> 34:16.542
Excuse me.

34:17.620 --> 34:20.100
<i>CHIEF: He spoke to the sky and said,</i>

34:20.156 --> 34:23.558
"And the people shall deliver unto you
the wicked

34:23.592 --> 34:25.702
"for your divine judgment

34:26.094 --> 34:28.869
"where their sins shall be weighed
in the balance

34:28.898 --> 34:33.965
- "of all that is just and true."
- Let go of me. Get your hands off me!

34:35.036 --> 34:37.041
- Daniel.
- What happened?

34:37.840 --> 34:40.761
- Didn't go so well.
- Yeah, I can see that.

34:42.011 --> 34:43.157
Excuse me.

34:44.614 --> 34:46.033
Harrid, stand back.

34:46.047 --> 34:48.327
- Sallis has been overcome.
- No, she hasn't.

34:48.351 --> 34:51.782
If you'll just let me explain it.
Listen to me!

34:52.722 --> 34:54.076
(GRUNTS)

34:56.125 --> 34:59.278
Fear not, for the Ori see all.

35:00.229 --> 35:02.338
Outside and within.

35:03.532 --> 35:06.273
If your heart is pure
and your devotion unwavering

35:06.302 --> 35:09.439
they will protect you.
They will cleanse your being

35:09.472 --> 35:12.410
and you will be taken
to be with them forever.

35:12.441 --> 35:17.033
If not, may the fire burn you down
to the ground and lay you in the dust.

35:18.014 --> 35:19.195
Fire?

35:32.061 --> 35:34.297
Hallowed are the Ori.

36:00.990 --> 36:03.876
Her heart rate is 140.
She's in distress.

36:04.193 --> 36:07.033
Daniel's B.P. and heart rate
are increasing, too.

36:07.063 --> 36:08.754
Pull the stones.

36:13.469 --> 36:14.650
I can't.

36:16.505 --> 36:19.246
- What the hell did you say?
- I think at first it was what I didn't say.

36:19.275 --> 36:22.148
You see, apparently there's a blessing
you're supposed to recite over the leaves

36:22.178 --> 36:24.787
before you drink,
which nobody warned me about.

36:24.814 --> 36:26.464
Then I think it's what I did say.

36:26.482 --> 36:28.859
I was trying to politely explain
what was going on

36:28.884 --> 36:32.385
and then his wife started screaming
and accusing me of being overcome,

36:32.421 --> 36:34.138
at which point I believe I suggested

36:34.156 --> 36:37.413
she might want to think about
procreation with herself.

36:39.362 --> 36:41.937
Listen! Please, listen to me.
You have to believe me!

36:41.964 --> 36:45.596
This is not what it looks like.
Sallis is not possessed, okay?

36:45.634 --> 36:47.780
Now, this is gonna sound crazy,

36:47.803 --> 36:50.828
but we're from another galaxy.

36:51.307 --> 36:53.585
That's right, we're using
a communication technology

36:53.609 --> 36:56.978
that allows us to take over a body
from very far away

36:57.013 --> 37:00.955
and then make us talk to you.
We just wanna talk to you.

37:13.662 --> 37:16.139
Okay. This is getting worse.
I'm administering a sedative.

37:16.165 --> 37:18.680
Hopefully, it'll calm things down.

37:30.546 --> 37:32.713
- Daniel!
- Okay, listen to me!

37:32.882 --> 37:34.599
Listen to me!
You have to believe me!

37:34.617 --> 37:37.093
- You're killing an innocent person!
- Daniel!

37:37.119 --> 37:40.179
Blessed are those
that deliver us from evil.

37:41.690 --> 37:43.381
(SCREAMING)

37:44.427 --> 37:45.538
No!

37:47.296 --> 37:49.300
- No!
- No!

37:55.404 --> 37:57.571
She's in V-fib. Code blue.

37:59.975 --> 38:03.128
- Charging to 200.
- No! Don't shoot.

38:03.379 --> 38:04.930
You got a better idea?

38:04.947 --> 38:07.126
You might cause a surge.
You could kill them both.

38:07.149 --> 38:09.527
You might detonate the power source.
Now, come on.

38:09.552 --> 38:10.802
Clear!

39:27.062 --> 39:29.031
Charge to 360. Clear!

39:31.934 --> 39:34.959
Still in V-fib. Charging again. Clear!

39:42.378 --> 39:44.920
I've got no pulse.
She's gone into asystole.

39:44.947 --> 39:46.372
<i>MAN: That's negative.</i>

39:47.883 --> 39:50.665
<i>- WOMAN: No change. It's still rising.</i>
- I'm calling it.

39:53.022 --> 39:56.047
- She's dead?
- I'm sorry.

40:41.437 --> 40:44.145
His vitals have stabilized
for the moment.

40:44.173 --> 40:46.550
- You can't pry the stones off?
- No.

40:46.575 --> 40:49.085
- And you don't want me to shoot it.
- No.

40:49.111 --> 40:51.753
Then how do we unplug this thing?

40:53.549 --> 40:55.926
- I don't know.
- Brilliant.

40:55.951 --> 40:59.551
At the very least, we need to find a way
to get that bracelet off of Dr. Jackson.

40:59.588 --> 41:01.999
They're still linked.
And without Vala, he'll...

41:02.324 --> 41:03.853
(MONITOR BEEPING)

41:05.060 --> 41:07.064
She's got a heartbeat.

41:23.812 --> 41:25.097
Daniel?

41:26.982 --> 41:28.545
Are you okay?

41:33.022 --> 41:35.154
I've got tingles all over.

41:36.392 --> 41:40.091
And don't flatter yourself,
I'm pretty sure it's not you.

41:43.365 --> 41:44.650
Thank you.

41:45.100 --> 41:46.698
Thank the Ori.

41:47.403 --> 41:48.653
Stand.

41:49.071 --> 41:51.040
You will come with me.

41:53.676 --> 41:56.933
I think he wants us to follow him.
Can you walk?

41:58.380 --> 42:00.999
If it means getting away from here.

42:22.838 --> 42:27.151
