<i>Nemo:
When I was a kid,</i>

01:34.728 --> 01:38.100
<i>my teacher asked,
what are the three things</i>

01:38.133 --> 01:41.936
<i>that I would save from my house
if it were on fire.</i>

01:43.271 --> 01:46.308
<i>I answered: My sketchbook,</i>

01:46.341 --> 01:51.146
<i>my ac/dc album
and my cat Groucho.</i>

01:57.751 --> 02:01.123
<i>I didn't mention my parents
or my sister.</i>

02:01.156 --> 02:03.891
<i>Of course,
most of the other kids did.</i>

02:04.725 --> 02:07.628
<i>Does that make me a bad person?</i>

02:11.333 --> 02:12.867
<i>My cat died,</i>

02:12.900 --> 02:16.338
<i>I lent that ac/dc album
to a guy named kojo</i>

02:16.371 --> 02:19.707
<i>and I never saw it again.</i>

02:20.308 --> 02:25.113
<i>But the sketchbook I kept.</i>

02:28.183 --> 02:29.783
<i>Cats die.</i>

02:30.718 --> 02:32.920
<i>Music fades.</i>

02:34.788 --> 02:38.260
<i>But art is for keeps.</i>

02:43.764 --> 02:46.800
Pilot: Hey, guys,
two minutes to drop-off.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.271
Proceeding as planned.

02:49.304 --> 02:51.039
Number three, all good?

02:51.072 --> 02:52.782
Number three:
All according to plan.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.042
I'm in position.

02:54.075 --> 02:55.809
Computer's online.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.348
Pilot:
Final approach to target.

03:00.382 --> 03:05.320
In position in five,
four, three,

03:05.353 --> 03:06.954
two, one.

03:06.987 --> 03:09.191
Number one, go, go!

03:29.177 --> 03:33.114
Number three:
Open sesame in three, two, one.

03:39.521 --> 03:41.256
Proceed to step two,

03:41.289 --> 03:44.125
deactivate the security system.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.534
Nemo:
Six, one, three.

03:54.269 --> 03:56.770
Number three:
Seven minutes and counting.

04:02.077 --> 04:04.012
There we are.

04:20.328 --> 04:22.264
Boo.

04:34.409 --> 04:36.944
That's fucking weird.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.085
Number three, come in.

04:44.119 --> 04:46.554
- Roger.
- The self-portrait isn't here.

04:46.588 --> 04:48.156
You what?

04:48.189 --> 04:50.191
I found the three other
schieles like clockwork,

04:50.225 --> 04:51.426
but no self-portrait.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.228
No self-portrait?

04:53.261 --> 04:54.995
Nemo:
Yeah, I'm in the master bedroom

04:55.030 --> 04:56.574
and there's another painting
where it should be.

04:56.598 --> 04:58.866
That's impossible.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.802
Go check
the video installation room.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.076
Four minutes and counting.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.551
I'm in the video
installation room.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.119
There's no paintings here.

05:18.153 --> 05:19.587
Are you sure?

05:21.323 --> 05:22.590
Uh, pretty sure.

05:22.624 --> 05:24.925
Look again.

05:24.958 --> 05:27.395
Man, the self-portrait
is not here.

05:27.429 --> 05:29.963
Where the fuck is it, then?

05:29.997 --> 05:32.033
How the fuck should I know?

05:32.067 --> 05:33.934
Maybe he took it with him
to Kazakhstan.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.338
Of course he didn't take it
to Kazakh-fucking-Stan.

05:36.371 --> 05:39.341
There's no way
he took it on a business trip.

05:39.374 --> 05:40.908
What do you want me to do?

05:40.941 --> 05:44.045
That piece was worth
three million, man.

05:44.079 --> 05:45.013
Damn it.

05:45.046 --> 05:47.482
We're out of time.
Take what you got and go.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.923
Number three, come in.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.360
I'm at the door. You hacked in?

05:58.393 --> 06:00.028
I am in.

06:00.061 --> 06:01.329
Here's the activation code.

06:01.363 --> 06:02.464

06:02.497 --> 06:04.099

48:39.954 --> 48:43.557

with some filtered water

48:43.591 --> 48:45.593

48:45.626 --> 48:49.697
the, uh, little vegetation

49:02.110 --> 49:06.480
<i>pasta de semola di grano duro,</i>

56:28.022 --> 56:30.991
Go to tompkins square park

56:31.025 --> 56:33.395
and look for a guy
named Danny c.

56:33.428 --> 56:37.065
He's usually near
the basketball courts.

56:37.098 --> 56:40.201
Usually there
in the late afternoon.

56:41.202 --> 56:43.505
Tell him...

56:43.538 --> 56:45.906
That I'm stuck here.

56:46.974 --> 56:49.177
No one's come.

57:03.725 --> 57:06.294
Do that for me.

57:16.704 --> 57:20.408
Nobody here but us pigeons.

57:20.442 --> 57:23.211
Right? Right?!

57:24.612 --> 57:28.516
Right?! Right?!

1:00:02.637 --> 1:00:04.706
Fucking self-portrait.

1:00:11.813 --> 1:00:13.781
Oh, fuck!

1:00:21.789 --> 1:00:24.826
What? Wh...

1:00:24.859 --> 1:00:27.528
What the fuck?

1:00:29.530 --> 1:00:31.399

1:01:47.608 --> 1:01:50.278
"Opposition is

1:02:39.061 --> 1:02:41.496
You.

1:03:56.171 --> 1:03:57.772
Jasmine?

1:03:59.074 --> 1:04:01.676
No. Hey!

1:04:01.709 --> 1:04:02.844
Goddamn!

1:04:02.877 --> 1:04:05.413

Nemo:
This moment.

1:05:53.587 --> 1:05:55.790
All the time.

1:05:57.259 --> 1:05:59.660
- Nemo: Hi.
- Owner: Welcome.

1:06:01.662 --> 1:06:03.864
Nemo:
This moment.

1:06:07.269 --> 1:06:11.572
All... will come after.

1:06:12.274 --> 1:06:15.710
After this moment...
All will come.

1:06:15.743 --> 1:06:17.745
Hey.

1:06:18.546 --> 1:06:20.115
You made it.

1:06:20.148 --> 1:06:23.151
Great. I'm so glad you're here.

1:06:23.185 --> 1:06:25.686
Welcome. Welcome.

1:06:25.720 --> 1:06:28.622
Come, let me get you a drink.

1:06:29.257 --> 1:06:32.260
So... how's it going?

1:06:32.294 --> 1:06:34.229
Good, thanks.

1:06:34.262 --> 1:06:36.530
Really? Oh, that-that's good.

1:06:36.564 --> 1:06:38.133
That's great.

1:06:38.166 --> 1:06:39.900
Yeah.

1:06:39.934 --> 1:06:42.003
Challenging times
we're living through.

1:06:42.037 --> 1:06:44.206
If you're keeping your head
above water,

1:06:44.239 --> 1:06:46.208
kudos to you.

1:06:46.241 --> 1:06:48.776
I like a challenge.

1:06:49.710 --> 1:06:52.513
What side of the divide
are you on?

1:06:53.348 --> 1:06:57.152
Is no man an island
or every man an island?

1:06:58.320 --> 1:07:00.288
I'm an island.

1:07:00.322 --> 1:07:04.026
But ask me again
after a few cocktails.

1:07:05.659 --> 1:07:08.729
That is the spirit.
That is the spirit.

1:07:09.730 --> 1:07:11.966
Have you seen the schiele?

1:07:11.999 --> 1:07:15.170
- The self-portrait?
- Yeah, I've seen it.

1:07:15.203 --> 1:07:16.937
And?

1:07:16.971 --> 1:07:19.174
What do you think?

1:07:23.978 --> 1:07:27.748
Look, there is champagne,
cocktails, whatever you like.

1:07:29.317 --> 1:07:31.886
Make yourself at home.

1:07:31.919 --> 1:07:33.587
I will.

1:07:33.621 --> 1:07:35.090
I'll catch you later.

1:07:35.123 --> 1:07:36.857
Boom.

1:07:46.700 --> 1:07:48.103
Owner:
Let's go, guys.

1:07:50.372 --> 1:07:53.341
Welcome, everyone,

1:07:53.375 --> 1:07:56.344
to this exciting private view

1:07:56.378 --> 1:08:00.048
of a new work by masbedo,

1:08:00.082 --> 1:08:05.220
an artist duo that I love
very, very, very much.

1:08:05.253 --> 1:08:06.854
Give them an applause.

1:08:08.889 --> 1:08:11.126
The puppet,

1:08:11.159 --> 1:08:12.993
the marionette,

1:08:13.028 --> 1:08:15.230
long a symbol

1:08:15.263 --> 1:08:19.700
of the inevitability of destiny.

1:08:19.733 --> 1:08:22.636
We are puppets.

1:08:22.670 --> 1:08:25.806
And the fates, gods,

1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:30.744
pull our strings,
determining our actions.

1:08:31.446 --> 1:08:33.981
Do we have free will

1:08:34.015 --> 1:08:37.119
or are we just puppets in a show

1:08:37.152 --> 1:08:40.654
controlled by unseen hands?

1:10:34.035 --> 1:10:35.370
Ah!

1:10:35.403 --> 1:10:37.838
Shit.

1:11:35.896 --> 1:11:37.831
And her mother says, "chicken."

<i>You-you get it, right?</i>

1:13:30.412 --> 1:13:32.547
<i>I mean, it's a Bulgarian joke,
actually.</i>

1:13:32.580 --> 1:13:36.251
<i>I learned it from, uh,
a very beautiful woman.</i>

1:13:36.284 --> 1:13:39.020

<i>I mean,
that was her greatest charm.</i>

1:13:48.730 --> 1:13:51.032
<i>And she told me this joke,</i>

1:13:51.065 --> 1:13:52.567
<i>and she said, "I warn you.</i>

1:13:52.600 --> 1:13:53.711
<i>It's a Bulgarian joke."</i>

1:13:53.735 --> 1:13:55.537
<i>So this will be a measure</i>

1:13:55.570 --> 1:13:58.373
<i>of whether you have the
Bulgarian sense of humor now.</i>

1:13:59.741 --> 1:14:02.976
<i>Clearly, uh, you all don't.</i>

1:14:03.011 --> 1:14:04.312
<i>I mean, thank you for listening.</i>

1:14:04.345 --> 1:14:06.047
<i>You're a good audience.</i>

1:14:06.080 --> 1:14:07.258

<i>Helps pass the time.</i>

1:14:10.585 --> 1:14:12.587
<i>I mean, this is what

1:14:12.620 --> 1:14:14.289
<i>to comfort each other</i>

1:14:14.322 --> 1:14:17.592

1:14:40.081 --> 1:14:42.617

1:15:13.781 --> 1:15:16.117
But when we met,

1:15:16.150 --> 1:15:20.255
I had a feeling that life
had taken over.

1:15:21.089 --> 1:15:24.425
I loved being in bed with you.

1:15:25.260 --> 1:15:28.596
I loved waking up next to you.

1:15:29.831 --> 1:15:32.567
And I knew you felt the same.

1:15:32.600 --> 1:15:35.136
<i>Nemo: This is just
my way to contribute, you know.</i>

1:15:35.169 --> 1:15:37.138
<i>Cheers to all of you.</i>

1:15:37.171 --> 1:15:39.440
<i>Cheers big ears.</i>

1:15:40.542 --> 1:15:43.745
<i>If you didn't like the joke,
I'm sorry but fuck you.</i>

1:15:43.778 --> 1:15:45.547
<i>I did the best I could,</i>

1:15:45.580 --> 1:15:49.150
<i>and if you didn't like that,
fuck you.</i>

1:18:14.495 --> 1:18:16.831
I have no energy.

Hoy. Hoy. Hoy.

1:19:18.426 --> 1:19:20.728
I feel you, brother.

1:19:23.731 --> 1:19:26.534
I'm gonna set you free.

1:24:38.879 --> 1:24:41.882
Oh, god.

<i>Nemo:
When I was a kid,</i>

1:35:28.629 --> 1:35:31.599
<i>my teacher asked,
what are the three things</i>

1:35:31.632 --> 1:35:35.503
<i>I would save from my house
if it were on fire.</i>

1:35:36.771 --> 1:35:40.541
<i>I answered: My sketchbook,</i>

1:35:40.575 --> 1:35:44.645
<i>my ac/dc album
and my cat Groucho.</i>

1:35:46.948 --> 1:35:48.649
<i>My cat died.</i>

1:35:48.683 --> 1:35:51.853
<i>I lent that ac/dc album
to a guy named kojo,</i>

1:35:51.886 --> 1:35:54.489
<i>and I never saw it again.</i>

1:35:55.323 --> 1:35:58.026

1:35:58.060 --> 1:36:00.428
