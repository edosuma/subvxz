<i>BEYOND THAT WHICH

00:10.844 --> 00:13.836
<i>IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE</i>

00:13.931 --> 00:16.764
<i>AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.</i>

00:16.850 --> 00:20.434

BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW,</i>

00:20.479 --> 00:22.686
<i>BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION.</i>

00:22.773 --> 00:25.856
<i>AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS</i>

00:25.943 --> 00:28.856
<i>AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.</i>

00:28.946 --> 00:31.438
<i>THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.</i>

00:31.490 --> 00:35.609

A METEOR?

01:30.716 --> 01:32.502
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
IT LOOKED LIKE.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.918
I DIDN'T HEAR ANY
CRASH THOUGH, DID YOU?

01:35.012 --> 01:38.380
NO, I DIDN'T HEAR
ANYTHING EXCEPT A ROAR.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.555
STEVE, WHAT WAS THAT?

01:40.642 --> 01:43.680
I GUESS IT VVAS A METEOR, HONEY.
IT CAME AVVFUL CLOSE, DIDN'T IT?

01:43.729 --> 01:48.599
TOO CLOSE FOR MY MONEY.
MUCH TOO CLOSE.

03:06.019 --> 03:09.228
SEE IF THE POVVER IS STILL
ON ON FLORAL STREET.

03:12.984 --> 03:15.316
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

03:15.404 --> 03:19.318
VVHY SHOULD THE POVVER GO OFF ALL

03:19.408 --> 03:21.945
MAYBE SOME KIND OF AN
ELECTRICAL STORM OR SOMETHING.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.493
NOW, THAT DON'T
SEEM LIKELY.

03:24.579 --> 03:27.822
THE SKY'S AS BLUE AS ANYTHING. NOT
A CLOUD, NO LIGHTNING, NO THUNDER.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.827
HOW COULD IT
BE A STORM?

03:29.918 --> 03:32.501
CAN'T GET A THING ON THE RADIO.
NOT EVEN ON THE PORTABLE.

03:32.587 --> 03:35.124
VVHY DON'T VVE GO DOWNTOWN
AND CHECK VVITH THE POLICE?

03:35.215 --> 03:37.798
THEY'LL PROBABLY THINK
VVE'RE CRAZY OR SOMETHING.

03:37.843 --> 03:40.961
A LITTLE POVVER FAILURE AND EVERYBODY
GETS FLUSTERED AND EVERYTHING.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.216
<i>IT ISN'T JUST A POWER
FAILURE, CHARLIE.</i>

03:43.306 --> 03:47.220

03:47.310 --> 03:50.803

<i>[engine won't turn over]</i>

IT WAS WORKING FINE BEFORE.

04:22.512 --> 04:23.798
ARE YOU OUT OF GAS?

04:23.889 --> 04:25.175
I JUST FILLED IT UP.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.006
WELL, WHAT
DOES IT MEAN?

04:27.058 --> 04:29.925
IT'S AS IF
EVERYTHING STOPPED.

04:30.020 --> 04:32.352
MAYBE WE'D BETTER
WALK DOWNTOWN.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.100
WELL, LET'S BOTH
GO, CHARLIE.

04:34.191 --> 04:35.681
YEAH.

04:38.028 --> 04:41.271
MR. BRAND,
YOU BETTER NOT.

04:41.364 --> 04:42.741
WHY NOT?

04:42.824 --> 04:45.737
THEY DON'T
WANT YOU TO.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.534
WHO DOESN'T
WANT US TO?

04:47.621 --> 04:50.113
THEM.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.618
THEM?

04:51.708 --> 04:53.415
WHO ARE THEM?

04:53.502 --> 04:57.040
WHOEVER WAS IN THAT THING
THAT CAME BY OVERHEAD.

04:57.130 --> 05:01.795
VVHOEVER VVAS IN THE THING THAT CAME OVER.
I DON'T THINK THEY VVANT US TO LEAVE HERE.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.973
VVHAT DO YOU MEAN, TOMMY?
VVHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

05:10.060 --> 05:13.052
THEY DON'T VVANT US TO LEAVE. THAT'S
VVHY THEY SHUT EVERYTHING OFF.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.808
VVHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?
VVHERE DID YOU GET THAT IDEA?

05:15.899 --> 05:17.936
ISN'T THAT THE CRAZIEST
THING YOU'VE HEARD?

05:18.026 --> 05:20.643
IT'S ALVVAYS THAT VVAY IN
EVERY STORY I'VE EVER READ

05:20.737 --> 05:23.399
ABOUT A SHIP LANDING
FROM OUTER SPACE.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.824
FROM OUTER SPACE, YET? SAL, YOU BETTER
TAKE HIM UPSTAIRS, PUT HIM TO BED.

05:26.910 --> 05:30.153
HE'S BEEN READING TOO MANY COMIC
BOOKS OR SEEING TOO MANY MOVIES.

05:30.247 --> 05:33.114
TOMMY, YOU STOP THAT KIND OF TALK.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

05:33.208 --> 05:36.746
GO AHEAD, TOMMY. VVE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK AND THEN YOU'LL SEE.

05:36.795 --> 05:40.459
IT VVASN'T A SHIP. IT VVAS
A METEOR OR SOMETHING.

05:40.549 --> 05:44.258
LIKELY AS NOT, THAT'S THE CAUSE OF THE
POVVER FAILURE AND ALL THE REST OF IT.

05:44.302 --> 05:48.921
METEORS CAN DO CRAZY THINGS
LIKE, LIKE SUN SPOTS.

05:48.974 --> 05:52.183
SURE THAT'S THE KIND OF
THING, LIKE SUN SPOTS.

05:52.269 --> 05:55.432
THEY RAISE CAIN VVITH RADIO
RECEPTION ALL OVER THE VVORLD.

05:55.480 --> 06:00.099
THIS THING BEING SO CLOSE, THERE'S NO
TELLING THE SORT OF STUFF IT CAN DO.

06:00.151 --> 06:02.859
YOU GO AHEAD, STEVE. YOU
AND CHARLIE GO INTO TOVVN,

06:02.946 --> 06:05.529
SEE IF THAT ISN'T
WHAT'S CAUSING IT ALL.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.949
MR. BRAND?

06:10.036 --> 06:11.947
MR. BRAND, PLEASE
DON'T LEAVE HERE.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.871
<i>YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN BE
ABLE TO GET TO TOWN.</i>

06:14.958 --> 06:17.450
IT VVAS THAT VVAY IN THE STORY.
NOBODY COULD LEAVE.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.126
<i>NOBODY EXCEPT--</i>

06:19.170 --> 06:20.956
EXCEPT WHO?

06:21.047 --> 06:23.539
<i>EXCEPT THE PEOPLE THEY'D
SENT DOWN AHEAD OF THEM.</i>

06:23.633 --> 06:28.002
THEY LOOKED JUST LIKE HUMANS. AND IT
VVASN'T UNTIL THE SHIP LANDED THAT-

06:28.096 --> 06:31.464
TOMMY, PLEASE, SON. HONEY,
DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.

06:31.516 --> 06:35.054
IT'S THE CRAZIEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD OF.
THE KID TELLS A COMIC BOOK PLOT

06:35.145 --> 06:37.056
AND WE STAND
HERE LISTENING.

06:37.147 --> 06:39.309
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.564
GO AHEAD, TOMMY. VVHAT
KIND OF A STORY VVAS IT?

06:41.651 --> 06:44.063
WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE
THEY SENT AHEAD?

06:44.154 --> 06:46.646
THAT VVAS THE VVAY THEY PREPARED
THINGS FOR THE LANDING.

06:46.740 --> 06:50.074
THEY SENT FOUR PEOPLE. A MOTHER
AND A FATHER AND TVVO KIDS

06:50.160 --> 06:53.403
VVHO LOOKED JUST LIKE
HUMANS, BUT THEY VVEREN'T.

07:08.345 --> 07:11.679
VVELL, I GUESS VVHAT VVE NEED TO DO
IS RUN A CHECK OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD

07:11.723 --> 07:14.761
AND FIND OUT WHICH ONES
OF US ARE REALLY HUMAN.

07:20.649 --> 07:24.768
THERE'S NO USE STANDING AROUND
MAKING BUM JOKES ABOUT IT.

07:27.322 --> 07:30.781
VVONDER IF FLORAL STREET'S GOT
THE SAME KIND OF DEAL VVE HAVE.

07:30.867 --> 07:34.451
WHERE'S PETE VAN HORN?
HAS HE COME BACK, YET?

07:34.537 --> 07:37.279
<i>[car trying to start]</i>

07:37.374 --> 07:39.866

NO DICE.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.583
<i>[tries again]</i>

07:48.885 --> 07:51.092
WELL, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT'S WRONG.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.965
NOTHING SEEMS
TO BE WORKING.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.468
CAN'T EVEN GET
THE CAR STARTED.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.300
<i>[car engine starts]</i>

08:04.234 --> 08:06.396

08:06.444 --> 08:08.060
HE GOT HIS
CAR STARTED.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.243
HOVV COME HIS CAR JUST UP
AND STARTED LIKE THAT?

08:20.291 --> 08:22.202
ALL BY ITSELF.

08:22.293 --> 08:25.581
HE VVASN'T ANYVVHERE NEAR IT.
IT JUST STARTED BY ITSELF.

08:27.716 --> 08:31.755
HE NEVER DID COME OUT TO LOOK AT
THAT THING THAT FLEVV OVERHEAD.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.840
HE WASN'T
EVEN INTERESTED.

08:33.929 --> 08:35.967
HE ALWAYS WAS
AN ODDBALL.

08:36.057 --> 08:39.799
HIM AND HIS WHOLE
FAMILY. REAL ODDBALL.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.556
NOVV, VVHY DIDN'T HE COME OUT
VVITH THE REST OF US TO LOOK?

08:42.647 --> 08:44.854
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO ASK HIM?

08:47.777 --> 08:49.359
(Brand)
WAIT A MINUTE.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.278
WAIT A MINUTE!

08:51.364 --> 08:54.152
NOW, LET'S
NOT BE A MOB.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.623
I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.543
I TRIED TO START IT.
IT WOULDN'T START.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.791
YOU SAW ME.
ALL OF YOU SAW ME.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.374
<i>[engine cuts out]</i>

09:18.016 --> 09:21.509
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

09:21.603 --> 09:26.222
I SVVEAR I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.
VVHAT'S HAPPENING?

09:26.316 --> 09:30.560
VVELL, MAYBE YOU BETTER TELL US. THERE'S
NOTHING VVORKING ON THIS STREET.

09:30.653 --> 09:34.487
NOTHING. NO LIGHTS,
NO POWER, NO RADIO.

09:34.532 --> 09:37.149
NOTHING EXCEPT
ONE CAR. YOURS.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.068
HOW DO YOU FIGURE
IT STARTED, LES?

09:39.162 --> 09:41.073
HOW DO YOU
EXPLAIN THAT?

09:41.164 --> 09:45.533
VVAIT A MINUTE, NOVV. JUST KEEP
YOUR DISTANCE. ALL OF YOU.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.914
OKAY, SO I'VE GOT A CAR
THAT STARTS BY ITSELF.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.211
WELL, IT'S A FREAK
THING, I ADMIT IT.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.585
WHAT'S IT MAKE ME, A
CRIMINAL OR SOMETHING?

09:52.675 --> 09:55.087
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT
STARTS, IT JUST DOES.

09:55.178 --> 09:57.340
WHAT'S THIS ALL
ABOUT, STEVE?

09:57.430 --> 09:59.546
<i>WE'RE ON A
MONSTER KICK, LES.</i>

09:59.641 --> 10:03.384
SEEMS THE GENERAL IMPRESSION NOVV
HOLDS THAT MAYBE THERE'S A FAMILY

10:03.478 --> 10:06.220
THAT ISN'T WHAT
WE THINK THEY ARE.

10:06.314 --> 10:10.057
MONSTERS FROM OUTER SPACE OR
SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN US.

10:10.151 --> 10:13.564
FIFTH COLUMNISTS
FROM THE VAST BEYOND.

10:13.655 --> 10:18.900
NOVV, DO YOU KNOVV ANYBODY THAT MIGHT FIT
THAT DESCRIPTION AROUND HERE ON MAPLE STREET?

10:18.993 --> 10:21.121
THIS IS A GAG
OR SOMETHING?

10:21.204 --> 10:23.445
VVHAT IS THIS? A PRACTICAL
JOKE OR SOMETHING?

10:23.540 --> 10:26.373
<i>[car engine starts]</i>

10:34.008 --> 10:37.751
THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO INCRIMINATE ME, HUH?

10:37.846 --> 10:41.305
THE CAR STARTS AND STOPS AND
THAT REALLY DOES IT, HUH?

10:41.391 --> 10:43.302
<i>REALLY DOES IT?</i>

10:43.393 --> 10:46.511
WELL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT
ANY MORE THAN ANY OF YOU DO.

10:49.399 --> 10:53.734
LOOK, YOU ALL KNOVV ME. VVE'VE LIVED HERE
FOR FIVE YEARS, RIGHT IN THIS HOUSE.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.896
VVE AREN'T ANY DIFFERENT FROM YOU.
ANY DIFFERENT AT ALL.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.106
THE WHOLE
THING IS JUST--

10:59.200 --> 11:01.316
REALLY, THE WHOLE

11:01.411 --> 11:04.995
VVELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE, LES
GOODMAN, THEN EXPLAIN VVHY YOU-

11:05.081 --> 11:06.788

GO AHEAD, EXPLAIN VVHAT?

11:14.757 --> 11:17.670
WELL, SOMETIMES I
STAY UP LATE AT NIGHT

11:17.760 --> 11:20.092
AND A COUPLE
OF TIMES--

11:20.180 --> 11:22.592
WELL, A COUPLE OF TIMES
I'VE COME OUT ON MY PORCH

11:22.682 --> 11:25.424
AND I'VE SEEN
LES GOODMAN HERE

11:25.518 --> 11:27.680
IN THE WEE HOURS
OF THE MORNING

11:27.770 --> 11:32.310
STANDING IN HIS YARD JUST
LOOKING UP AT THE SKY.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.017
THAT'S RIGHT. JUST, JUST
LOOKING UP AT THE SKY

11:35.111 --> 11:38.479
<i>AS THOUGH HE WERE
WAITING FOR SOMETHING.</i>

11:38.573 --> 11:41.531
AS THOUGH HE WERE
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.905
YOU KNOW, REALLY
THIS IS FOR LAUGHS.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.780
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M GUILTY OF?

11:47.874 --> 11:50.707
I'M GUILTY
OF INSOMNIA.

11:50.793 --> 11:54.536
NOW, WHAT'S THE
PENALTY FOR THAT?

11:54.631 --> 11:58.124
VVELL, YOU HEARD VVHAT I SAID.
I SAID IT VVAS INSOMNIA.

11:58.176 --> 12:00.543
I SAID IT WAS INSOMNIA!

12:00.637 --> 12:04.631
YOU SCARED, FRIGHTENED
RABBITS, YOU.

12:04.682 --> 12:07.060
YOU'RE SICK PEOPLE,
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

12:07.143 --> 12:09.635
YOU'RE SICK PEOPLE,
ALL OF YOU.

12:09.687 --> 12:13.646
AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOVV VVHAT YOU'RE
STARTING HERE BECAUSE LET ME TELL YOU,

12:13.733 --> 12:17.727
LET ME TELL YOU, YOU'RE
STARTING SOMETHING HERE THAT-

12:17.820 --> 12:20.232
THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD
BE FRIGHTENED OF.

12:20.323 --> 12:24.191
AS GOD IS MY VVITNESS, YOU'RE LETTING
SOMETHING BEGIN HERE THAT'S-

12:24.285 --> 12:26.071
THAT'S A NIGHTMARE.

13:15.211 --> 13:18.294
IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT
KEEPING A WATCH ON THEM.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.748
THEY'RE OUR NEIGHBORS.

13:20.842 --> 13:25.382
VVE'\/E KNOVVN THE GOODMANS EVER SINCE
THEY CAME HERE. VVE'\/E BEEN GOOD FRIENDS.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.722
LOOK, THAT DON'T
PROVE A THING.

13:29.767 --> 13:33.260
ANY GUY VVHO'D SPEND HIS TIME LOOKING
UP AT THE SKY EARLY IN THE MORNING,

13:33.354 --> 13:35.971
THERE'S SOMETHING VVRONG
VVITH THAT KIND OF A PERSON.

13:36.065 --> 13:40.059
SOMETHING THAT
AIN'T LEGITIMATE.

13:40.153 --> 13:45.319
UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES LET IT GO BY,
BUT THESE AREN'T NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.490
LOOK AT THAT STREET.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.818
NOTHING BUT CANDLES.

13:49.912 --> 13:53.325
IT'S LIKE GOING BACK INTO
THE DARK AGES OR SOMETHING.

13:53.416 --> 13:58.411
<i>STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE, STEVE.
WE DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE.</i>

13:58.463 --> 14:02.832
BUT THIS TIME, ANYONE VVHO SETS FOOT ON MY
PORCH, THAT'S VVHAT HE'S GONNA GET. TROUBLE.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.427
LOOK, LES, I'M--

14:04.510 --> 14:06.251
I'VE ALREADY
EXPLAINED TO YOU PEOPLE.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.429
I DON'T SLEEP VERY WELL
AT NIGHT SOMETIMES,

14:09.515 --> 14:13.975
SO I GET UP, I GO OUT, I TAKE A
VVALK, I LOOK UP AT THE SKY,
