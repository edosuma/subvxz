ACQUITTED OF ALL CHARGES
THAT LOVEABLE SCAMP, WAS PUT

00:30.764 --> 00:42.175

JUST FOR DOING THE BRAVEST THING
ANY AMERICAN CAN DO, PROTECTING

00:42.175 --> 00:48.415
AN EMPTY CAR LOT IN SOMEONE
ELSE'S TOWN.
ON TO OUR NEXT GUEST

00:48.415 --> 00:59.259

MAN, IMPARTIAL AS ANYONE
JUDGE BRUCE SCHRODER

00:59.259 --> 01:03.930
>> THANK YOU
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, NOW, I'M
NOT USED TO TELEVISION

01:03.930 --> 01:10.737
INTERVIEWS
YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT I WAS IN
CHARGE OF INVESTIGATING ROBERT

01:10.737 --> 01:12.806
DURST FOR MURDER BACK IN 1983,
WELL, FOLKS, 30 YEARS AND ONE
ADDITIONAL MURDER LATER, WE GOT

01:12.806 --> 01:15.942
HIM.
NOW, IF I MAY SAY, JUDGE TO
JUDGE, WHAT TURNED ME ON THE

01:15.942 --> 01:22.215
MOST WAS HOW YOU RULED THAT
COURTROOM WITH AN IRON FIST.
TELL US HOW YOU DID IT

01:22.215 --> 01:27.387
>> WELL, IT WAS ALL STANDARD
PROCEDURE.
THAT'S WHY I ORDERED THAT THE

01:27.387 --> 01:32.092
PROSECUTION NOT USE THE WORD
"VICTIMS."
THEY WERE RIOTERS, AND THEY

01:32.092 --> 01:41.668
WEREN'T SHOT, THEY WERE
GADOINKED.
BUT THAT DID NOT GIVE MY CLIENT

01:41.668 --> 01:47.240
AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE IN ANY WAY
>> NOW, YOU SAID MY CLIENT, DO
YOU MEAN THE DEFENDANT

01:47.240 --> 01:53.847
>> OH, YES
SURE
I KEEP DOING THAT.

01:53.847 --> 01:59.285
>> WELL, YOU DO YOU, JUDGE

THANKS FOR COMING.

01:59.285 --> 02:02.856
PREDICTABLY, THE LOONEY LIBERAL
OUTRAGE MACHINE'S IN OVERDRIVE,

02:02.856 --> 02:08.595

ON YOU DUMB DUMBS.

02:24.744 --> 02:28.948
SANDRA, WERE YOU SURPRISED BY
YESTERDAY'S VERDICT?
>> SURPRISED THAT HE WAS

02:28.948 --> 02:35.188
EXONERATED ON ALL CHARGES?
YEAH, THAT'S PUTTING IT MILDLY
I WAS SHOCKED.

02:35.188 --> 02:42.095
>> YOU WERE?
BECAUSE I WASN'T
>> I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING

02:42.095 --> 02:45.098
LIKE IT BEFORE
>> OH I HAVE, MANY TIMES
>> I MEAN, THIS IS NOT WHO WE

02:45.098 --> 02:51.338
ARE.
>> I FEEL LIKE IT KIND OF IS
>> AND ALL THIS DOES IS SEND A

02:51.338 --> 02:54.974
MESSAGE THAT ANY AMERICAN CAN
JUST PROWL THE STREETS WITH AN
AK-47.

02:54.974 --> 03:01.781
>> ANY AMERICAN?
I THINK YOU'RE MISSING A KEYWORD
THERE.

03:01.781 --> 03:10.123
>> ALL WE CAN HOPE FOR IS THAT
AT THIS POINT, THIS WILL BE A
CALL TO FINALLY CHANGE THE

03:10.123 --> 03:12.192
SYSTEM
>> AND THAT CALL WILL GO TO
VOICE MAIL AND THAT INBOX IS

03:12.192 --> 03:20.433
FULL, OKAY
>> WOW, VERY INTERESTING
WELL, YOUR SEGMENT IS OVER, AND

03:20.433 --> 03:26.806
MY MUG IS EMPTY, SO YOU GOT TO
GO
NOW ON A MORE INSPIRING NOTE,

03:26.806 --> 03:34.147
KEVIN McCARTHY ROCKED THE HOUSE
DOWN WITH HIS AWE INSPIRIN
EIGHT-HOUR TIRADE AGAINST THE

03:34.147 --> 03:36.249
BUILD BACK BETTER BILL,
DEMONSTRATING WHY KEEPING THE
FILIBUSTER IS VITAL TO OUR

03:36.249 --> 03:39.786
DEMOCRACY.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HOUR SIX OF
HIS RHETORICAL MASTERPIECE

03:39.786 --> 03:46.092
>> DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO FLIP
THIS THING AROUND.
EXCUSE ME.

03:46.092 --> 03:55.101
DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO FLIP
THIS AROUND.
EXCUSE ME.

03:55.101 --> 04:02.208
FLIP IT AROUND
WHOOPS
I COULD DO IT BEFORE

04:02.208 --> 04:04.411
>> AND THAT BRAVE MAN STOPPED
THE BUILD BACK BETTER BILL FROM
BEING PASSED UNTIL THE NEXT DAY

04:04.411 --> 04:10.583
WHEN IT PASSED IN TWO MINUTES.
MEANWHILE, WHAT WAS PRESIDENT
BRANDON DOING?

04:10.583 --> 04:16.856
GETTING SOCIALIZED BUTT PLAGUE
PAID FOR BY YOUR TAX DOLLARS
DEMOCRATS ARE PRAISING PASSED

04:16.856 --> 04:23.096

IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE HERE.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.113
>> WELL, I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT
OF THOUGHTS ON THE
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL, SO IF IT'S

04:40.113 --> 04:44.818
OKAY, I'M JUST GOING TO LET YOU

ABSOLUTELY ROCK HARD

04:44.818 --> 04:49.089
>> YOU KNOW, I'M GLAD YOU
BROUGHT THAT UP BECAUSE THAT
TERRIBLE BILL, YOU KNOW WHAT,

04:49.089 --> 04:59.099
THE TRUTH IS NOBODY DID MORE FOR
THE INFRASTRUCTURE, YOU KNOW,
THAN ME, AND MEEPLE IS SAYING,

04:59.099 --> 05:04.037
AND MEEPLE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE
ME
THEY'RE SAYING, OKAY, BUILD IT

05:06.439 --> 05:08.475
OKAY
BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL
OKAY IT'S NOT JUST WALL.

05:08.475 --> 05:12.645
WHEN YOU PUT WALL IN A GRASSY
FIELD, FRANKLY, THAT'S ROAD.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT IF YOU TAKE

05:12.645 --> 05:15.782
WALL AND LAY IT ACROSS THE
RIVER, FRANKLY, WE'RE DOING
BRIDGE

05:15.782 --> 05:24.924
>> WOW, I AM EDGING.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT
CAN I JUST SAY 60 SECONDS ON THE

05:24.924 --> 05:30.163
CLOCK, PLEASE?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SLEEPY JOE BIDEN IS SUCH A

05:30.163 --> 05:38.738
DISASTER
WE'RE COMING BACK.
EVERYBODY LOVES THE REBOOT

05:38.738 --> 05:48.648
JUST LIKE I-CARLY.
JOE BIDEN TRIED TO REBOOT OBAMA,
AND IT FLOPPED JUST LIKE THE

05:48.648 --> 05:58.692
FEMALE "GHOSTBUSTERS."
WHY DID THEY REBOOT "GOSSIP
GIRL."

05:58.692 --> 06:03.329
YOU CAN'T MATCH IT
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS WAS TRUE.

06:03.329 --> 06:15.041
SOMETIMES SERENA WAS THE BAD
FRIEND TO BLARE.
>> OH, I HOPE THIS NEVER ENDS.

06:15.041 --> 06:20.747
>> WHY DON'T WE TRY A WORD
SEARCH THIS TIME
I'D LOVE IT IF IT WAS WORD

06:20.747 --> 06:25.385
SEARCH
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WAS TREATED VERY UNFAIRLY BY

06:25.385 --> 06:30.457
CHRIS CRISTIE.
HE WAS VERY NASTY, AND HE SAID
VERY NASTY THINGS ABOUT ME ON

06:30.457 --> 06:38.064
BILL MAHR.
WE LOVE HIM.
HE'S A WONDERFUL PERSON.

06:38.064 --> 06:44.337
BUT I DON'T THINK WE LOVE HIM A
LOT.
WE HATE HIM A LOT.

06:44.337 --> 06:51.111
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, SPEAKING OF
NEW RULES, DUA LIPA IS ONE OF
OUR BEST SINGERS, AND HER

06:51.111 --> 06:54.748
HUSBAND, YOU KNOW WHAT, IS NOT
VERY ATTRACTIVE.
IT'S TERRIBLE WHAT THEY'RE DOING

06:54.748 --> 07:02.055
WITH DUA LIPA'S HUSBAND NOT
BEING VERY ATTRACTIVE.
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

07:02.055 --> 07:07.761
IT
SHE'S TALL, SHE'S ARMENIAN,
WHICH IS BASICALLY WHITE

07:07.761 --> 07:15.235
AND YOU KNOW WHO ELSE IS WHITE
BOB THE BUILDER ERBUILDER

09:51.791 --> 09:53.326
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> THANK YOU
THANK YOU.

09:53.326 --> 10:02.869
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MY NAME IS SIMU LIU, AND SOME OF
YOU -- SOME OF YOU MIGHT KNOW ME

10:02.869 --> 10:06.773
FROM MARVEL'
"SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE
10 RINGS."

10:06.773 --> 10:11.478
I AM OFFICIALLY MARVEL'S FIRST
OPENLY
CHINESE SUPERHERO.

10:11.478 --> 10:18.785
I'M ALSO THE FIRST CHINESE HOST
ON "SNL," TO BE THE FOURTH
CHINESE HOST ON "SNL."

10:18.785 --> 10:26.526
I'M ACTUALLY CHINESE CANADIAN,
AND I AM SO HAPPY TO BE HERE FOR
THE THANKSGIVING SHOW.

10:26.526 --> 10:28.895
NOW, IN CANADA, THANKSGIVING IS
ACTUALLY IN OCTOBER, AND MARKS
THE START OF THE HARVEST SEASON.

10:28.895 --> 10:35.769
AND HERE IN AMERICA, THINGS ARE
A LITTLE DIFFERENT
IT'S IN NOVEMBER, AND IT MARKS

10:35.769 --> 10:39.305
THE START OF BLACK FRIDAY WEEK
ON AMAZON PRIME.
BUT I DO HAVE A LOT TO BE

10:39.305 --> 10:41.207
THANKFUL FOR
NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKED ME
HOW I LANDED A ROLE IN A MARVEL

10:41.207 --> 10:47.247
MOVIE.
AND THE TRUTH IS I GOT SHANG-CHI
HOW HOW EVERY CANADIAN GETS

10:47.247 --> 10:50.784
THEIR BIG BREAK.
BY ASKING POLITELY
FOR REAL

10:50.784 --> 10:57.023
BACK IN 2014, AND THIS IS A TRUE
STORY, I TWEETED, "HEY, MARVEL
GREAT JOB WITH CAPTAIN AMERICA

10:57.023 --> 10:59.059
AND THOR
HOW ABOUT AN ASIAN SUPERHERO?"
I THINK THAT TWEET GOT LIKE TEN

10:59.059 --> 11:04.164
LIKES, WHICH IS LIKE, TEN MORE
THAT I USUALLY GOT, AND I WORKED
HARD, AND FIVE YEARS LATER,

11:04.164 --> 11:08.868
MARVEL DID MAKE THEIR FIRST
ASIAN SUPERHERO MOVIE, AND AFTER
I GOT THE PART, I WENT ONLINE

11:08.868 --> 11:18.845
AND TWEETED "THANKS FOR GETTING
BACK TO ME."
CLEARLY, I'M CANADIAN.

11:18.845 --> 11:29.989
I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE MY LIFE
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE TEN YEARS AGO
I HAD A JOB DRESSING UP AS

11:29.989 --> 11:36.930
SPIDERMAN AT KIDS BIRTHDAY
PARTIES.
AT ONE PARTY

11:36.930 --> 11:38.998
AND I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS ONE
BIRTHDAY BOY
HIS NAME WAS TREVOR, AND I DON'T

11:38.998 --> 11:41.101
WANT TO SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT
HIM, BUT LET'S JUST SAY HE WAS A
REAL TREVOR.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.736
HE KEPT KICKING MY SHINS AND
SCREAMING YOU'RE NOT SPIDER-MAN,
YOU'RE NOT SPIDER-MAN.

11:42.736 --> 11:49.009
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE
BEEN KICKED BY A 7-YEAR-OLD
WHILE WEARING A $30 WALMART

11:49.009 --> 11:51.378
SPIDER-MAN SUIT, BUT IT WILL
BREAK YOU.
IT WILL BREAK YOUR SPIRIT.

11:51.378 --> 11:57.884
BUT IT ALSO LIT A FIRE UNDER ME,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS
NOW.

11:57.884 --> 12:01.755
BUT, TREVOR, IF YOU ARE
WATCHING, I JUST WANT TO SAY,
YOU WERE RIGHT

12:01.755 --> 12:05.859
I'M NOT SPIDER-MAN
I'M SHANG-CHI, BITCH

UP, THE HOUSE HAD PASSED THE
$2 TRILLION SOCIAL SAFETY NET
BILL, THE RITTENHOUSE VERDICT

WAS ANNOUNCED AND A WOMAN HAD
TECHNICALLY BEEN PRESIDENT FOR
