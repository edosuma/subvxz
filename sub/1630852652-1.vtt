WEBVTT

00:33.708 --> 00:37.958
Monica, if you spell
this next word correctly,

00:38.541 --> 00:44.166
we will declare you the 2005
Scribbs National Spelling Bee champion.

00:45.875 --> 00:48.708
-Opsimath.
-Definition, please?

00:49.583 --> 00:54.750
Opsimath is a person who begins to learn
or study late in life.

00:55.958 --> 00:59.166
-Language of origin?
-Ancient Greek.

00:59.250 --> 01:03.416
-Are there any alternate pronunciations?
-Just the one.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.708
-Part of speech?
-Noun.

01:05.791 --> 01:09.541
-Can you please repeat the word again?
-Opsimath.

01:13.708 --> 01:15.208
Opsimath.

01:15.291 --> 01:21.375
O-P-S-I-M-A-T-H.

01:21.458 --> 01:22.500
Opsimath.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.125
That is correct!

01:24.208 --> 01:26.791
-
-Congratulations, Monica.

01:26.875 --> 01:31.291
You are the 2005
Scribbs National Spelling Bee champion!

01:42.000 --> 01:46.041
Joining us now via satellite
is this year's Scribbs national champ

01:46.125 --> 01:47.958
or "Scramp,"
as she likes to call herself…

01:48.041 --> 01:49.958
-
-…Monica Chowdry,

01:50.041 --> 01:53.250
who has stolen America's hearts
with her stoic demeanor

01:53.333 --> 01:54.458
and spelling prowess.

01:54.541 --> 01:56.916
Hi, I'm Monica Chowdry.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.833
I'm eight years old,
and I'm from Greensburg, Pennsylvania.

02:01.416 --> 02:03.375


02:03.458 --> 02:07.333
Oh, she is as sweet
as a glass of mango lassi.

02:07.416 --> 02:09.083
I could just slurp her
right down, Wayland.

02:09.166 --> 02:12.166
-Oh, me too, Crystal. Me too.
-Mm-hm.

02:12.250 --> 02:13.750


02:20.083 --> 02:22.625
Learning is like chewing gum.

02:22.708 --> 02:26.166
Some gum, you spit out,
like the multiplication tables.

02:26.250 --> 02:28.583
You might find a piece of gum
stuck to the bottom of your shoe,

02:28.666 --> 02:32.208
like discovering roosters
have built-in ear plugs.

02:32.291 --> 02:33.125
That's true.

02:33.833 --> 02:38.666
Other gum, you swallow,
and it stays with you for years.

02:38.750 --> 02:42.625
-Like riding a bike.

02:42.708 --> 02:46.875
Today's <i>Learning with LeVar </i>little learner
is a very special person.

02:46.958 --> 02:51.416
I am so proud to be able to invite
the Scribbs Spelling Bee champion,

02:51.500 --> 02:54.416
-Monica Chowdry, to our classroom.
-Hooray!

02:59.041 --> 03:01.916
-Hooray!

03:02.000 --> 03:07.416
-Words, words, words, words, words!

03:07.500 --> 03:09.250
<i>Opsimath, O…</i>

03:09.333 --> 03:11.125
Ma, you're watching this again?

03:11.208 --> 03:15.250
But I cannot believe that you let me
cut your hair into that boy cut.

03:15.333 --> 03:17.833
Well, I didn't have much choice as a kid.

03:19.208 --> 03:21.541
Mm. Oh, honey.

03:22.416 --> 03:25.041
Your chai is Oprah-level quality.

03:25.125 --> 03:27.166
Eat all the Marie biscuits, okay?

03:27.708 --> 03:29.500
I don't want to find them
all crumby in your pocket

03:29.583 --> 03:30.916
next time I'm doing laundry.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.000
Will you be home this afternoon?

03:33.083 --> 03:34.541
Ma, yes!

03:34.625 --> 03:36.875
I told you this, like, five times already.

03:36.958 --> 03:40.333
I've got a couple tutoring sessions,
and then I'll be home after lunch.

03:51.083 --> 03:52.416
Eat all your Marie biscuits.

04:02.583 --> 04:05.166
<i>Greetings, Ms. Chowdry.</i>
<i>Good news.</i>

04:05.250 --> 04:08.791
<i>We'd love to offer you the full-time</i>
<i>clinical research technician post</i>

04:08.875 --> 04:10.500
<i>at Dellview Labs.</i>

04:10.583 --> 04:13.458
<i>So please call me back</i>
<i>at your earliest convenience.</i>

04:33.166 --> 04:34.333
Good job!

05:00.958 --> 05:03.208
-Boony!
-Dada.

05:03.291 --> 05:05.166
Oh, I hope you got extra hush puppies.

05:05.250 --> 05:07.250
Oh, I gotta take these off you.

05:07.333 --> 05:09.041
Sorry, I'm starving. Ooh, what'd you get?

05:09.125 --> 05:10.291
Ma's on a diet.

05:10.375 --> 05:13.166
Suicide, it's cheat day!

05:13.250 --> 05:15.125
Yo, Mom, food's here!

05:16.250 --> 05:18.333
I-I feel like
there's extra crispy to this one.

05:19.458 --> 05:22.666
Dada helped me send
the paperless post for Baba's memorial.

05:22.750 --> 05:25.583
Did you just forget to add my name
to the guest list?

05:25.666 --> 05:26.791
We knew you would have
this kind of reaction.

05:26.875 --> 05:27.750
Okay.

05:27.833 --> 05:30.000
So we thought it was best
to tell you one-to-one.

05:30.083 --> 05:33.208
-I can't fucking believe this.
-Don't say that F!

05:33.291 --> 05:36.875
I don't like that F.

05:36.958 --> 05:39.250
Dada is here for one week
for Baba's memorial.

05:40.791 --> 05:44.250
-Ah, my pressure has lifted.
-O-Okay. Okay.

05:45.083 --> 05:48.416
Now I have made a list of food
that we need for the havan.

05:52.125 --> 05:53.250
He can't go by himself?

05:53.333 --> 05:54.458
Boony!

05:54.541 --> 05:55.875
-Fine, fine.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.750
Did you get extra kurkure?

05:59.833 --> 06:01.625
Yes, of course and crab cakes.

06:02.125 --> 06:04.500
You know, I might have
gormandized one in the car.

06:04.583 --> 06:07.083
-Good. You are too skinny.
-Yeah, Boony has always been too skinny.

06:07.166 --> 06:08.333
Ho-ho.

06:08.416 --> 06:11.416
Ooh, what's going on over here?
Shah Rukh Khan?

06:11.500 --> 06:15.083
Hey, what's up with Hrithik Roshan?
Still has six fingers? Look at that, Mama.

06:23.416 --> 06:24.875
Hey, Boony, you up here?

06:26.833 --> 06:28.625
Whoa.

06:29.708 --> 06:31.708
I love what you've done with this place.

06:35.250 --> 06:39.500
Except this bunny.
Ooh, this bunny is fugs.

06:40.708 --> 06:42.291
Sewed it in middle school.

06:42.875 --> 06:45.916
It's creepy. Still fugs though.

06:54.291 --> 06:57.458
-You gonna offer me a hit or what?
-You don't smoke.

06:57.541 --> 06:59.958
Uh… …newsflash, Boony,

07:00.041 --> 07:02.833
I've been known to get into the reefer,
you know, occasionally.

07:04.333 --> 07:06.083
-Help yourself.
-Thanks.

07:07.750 --> 07:10.083
Let's see if this competes
with the Cali cron.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.250
I'm used to the California stuff,
you know.

07:23.958 --> 07:26.250
You still have this?

07:28.208 --> 07:29.041
Yup.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.375
Conway Kid Olympics.

07:32.166 --> 07:33.958
I can't believe I organized
that whole thing.

07:34.041 --> 07:35.916
You were the only female competitor.

07:37.125 --> 07:38.208
Uh-huh.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.708
Baba made
that kick-ass jump-jump apparatus.

07:43.250 --> 07:44.291
This tree house too.

07:45.000 --> 07:45.958
Yeah.

07:46.833 --> 07:49.250
Maybe you should dust it off,
defend your medal.

07:51.041 --> 07:51.875
Maybe.

07:57.833 --> 07:59.666
Okay, well, great talk.

08:00.625 --> 08:02.875
I'll let you get back
to your painting, Picasso.

08:02.958 --> 08:03.791
Okay.

08:05.750 --> 08:06.583
Cool, see you.

08:09.625 --> 08:13.000
I probably shouldn't have smoked
before climbing down this ladder.

08:22.625 --> 08:27.291
-To clinical research lab person…
-Technician.

08:27.375 --> 08:31.208
To clinical research lab technician,
Monica Chowdry.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.708
Ugh. What's even the point
of virgin shots?

08:39.333 --> 08:40.375
Empty calories?

08:42.541 --> 08:43.958
I haven't said yes yet.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.125
But you will.

08:47.041 --> 08:49.333
You have to, it's your dream job,

08:49.416 --> 08:52.541
sitting in a dark room,
breathing dangerous chemicals,

08:52.625 --> 08:55.291
cloning ugly-ass rats,
curing cancer and shit.

08:56.250 --> 08:58.000
We'll see how Ma convalesces.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.375
Mon, I wasn't a word nerd.

09:00.916 --> 09:03.541
Sorry. We'll see if Ma gets better.

09:03.625 --> 09:04.708
Gracias.

09:04.791 --> 09:07.125
And let Sonny take care of Jaya for once.

09:08.375 --> 09:09.750
All right.

09:11.541 --> 09:13.500
You okay? You wanna crash at my place?

09:13.583 --> 09:17.291
Nah, it's just for a week.
Sonny's gotta get back to work.

09:17.375 --> 09:19.916
Well, it's good he's got a job, right?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.208
I guess. We'll see for how long though.

09:22.291 --> 09:24.333
Well, you know I've got you
if you need some air.

09:24.416 --> 09:25.583
I know.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.916
I don't know how you work here sober.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.250
Oh, I got my poison.

09:43.875 --> 09:44.958
<i>Licentious.</i>

09:45.041 --> 09:50.208
<i>L-I-C-E-N-T-I-O-U-S. Licentious.</i>

09:50.291 --> 09:54.166
<i>Promiscuous and unprincipled</i>
<i>in sexual matters.</i>

09:55.916 --> 09:59.541
Hey, um, can I just get
a beer or something?

09:59.625 --> 10:00.500
Yeah.

10:00.583 --> 10:03.250
Y-You know what?
I'll take, uh, a whiskey, neat.

10:03.333 --> 10:04.166
-Okay.
-On the rocks.

10:04.250 --> 10:06.291
Actually, I'll just take
a vodka soda.

10:06.375 --> 10:08.791
-Yeah. You got Tito's?
-Yes.

10:09.375 --> 10:12.291
-Cool. Thanks.
-That's a skinny bitch drink.

10:13.750 --> 10:14.833
Monica Chowdry?

10:15.875 --> 10:16.791
Yeah?

10:17.291 --> 10:19.166
Holy shit!

10:19.875 --> 10:21.791
You-- You won the spelling bee.

10:21.875 --> 10:25.375
Yo, we had that big pep rally
when you got back from DC.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.375
Oh, my God.

10:26.458 --> 10:29.250
-Scribb, Scribb, Scribb!

10:29.333 --> 10:31.291
Greensburg's own Scribb champ.

10:31.375 --> 10:34.916
Man, you were like a…
A legit celebrity.

10:35.791 --> 10:37.250
I guess.

10:40.875 --> 10:43.708
I'm Richie. Richie Kim?

10:43.791 --> 10:46.583
I was in Mrs. Jugen's science class
with you guys.

10:46.666 --> 10:48.291
Um, Krista Santos, right?

10:48.375 --> 10:50.666
Oh, yeah. Richie Kim!

10:50.750 --> 10:52.916
You were the one
that took those baby chicks home

10:53.000 --> 10:54.625
then brought them back the next day

10:54.708 --> 10:57.083
'cause you never asked your mom,
and she was pissed.

10:57.166 --> 10:59.125
Yo, she was so pissed.

10:59.208 --> 11:01.458
There was, like, little baby chicken shit

11:01.541 --> 11:02.916
-all over her fancy shag carpet.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.041
What brings you back to the GBG?

11:06.166 --> 11:07.291
Uh, um…

11:07.375 --> 11:11.041
my Uncle Quincy died,
so you know, funeral stuff, yeah.

11:11.125 --> 11:12.375
Um, sorry.

11:12.458 --> 11:15.125
Psh, whatever.
He was a racist jagoff.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.666
-Rest in peace, dick.

11:17.750 --> 11:19.166
I'm looking down
'cause he probably went to hell.

11:19.250 --> 11:21.208
-Shit.

11:21.291 --> 11:24.250
-Oh, another brewsky for the champ?
-You want another one?

11:25.208 --> 11:26.041
Sure.

11:33.208 --> 11:34.041
Thanks.

11:38.125 --> 11:40.000
Is-Is this seat open?

11:42.125 --> 11:43.625
-Yep.
-Oh, cool.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.458
Ah.

11:56.916 --> 11:58.041
You know, I, um…

11:58.666 --> 12:00.791
I totally had a crush on you
in high school.

12:00.875 --> 12:02.166
-Yeah, right.
-Yeah.

12:02.250 --> 12:03.958
I wore my brother's hand-me-downs

12:04.041 --> 12:05.833
and had those thick purple glasses

12:05.916 --> 12:09.083
that were, like, ten times
the size of my cranium.

12:09.791 --> 12:10.791
Still cute.

12:12.750 --> 12:15.166
-But you never asked me out.
-You wanna go out?

12:32.250 --> 12:34.041
-Get your hands off my little sister!
-What are you doing?

12:34.125 --> 12:36.291
Dude, it's cool, man!
It's, like, consensual or whatever!

12:36.375 --> 12:37.208
-Address me as "sir"!
-Hey!

12:37.291 --> 12:38.125
What?

12:38.208 --> 12:40.250
You want me to come over to your place
and fucking bang out your little sister?

12:40.333 --> 12:42.041
-Stop!
-No, no, no!

12:42.125 --> 12:44.250
-No, what?
-No-No, sir. No, sir.

12:44.333 --> 12:45.416
Good!

12:45.500 --> 12:47.958
Now get your six-pack,
skinny jean-wearing ass out of here.

12:48.041 --> 12:49.666
I never wanna see
your fucking face again, you hear me?

12:49.750 --> 12:51.416
You got it, sir, yep. Loud and clear, sir.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.583
-Good.
-Yep, okay.

12:55.875 --> 12:56.708
Move it!

13:08.250 --> 13:09.541
You're not funny!

13:09.625 --> 13:11.666
What the hell?
Hey, I was just messing around!

13:11.750 --> 13:13.416
-I wasn't gonna actually--
-Fucking crazy!

13:13.500 --> 13:14.625
-Wait! Ooh, relax.

13:19.125 --> 13:21.083
-Come on.
-Why did you come back?

14:35.875 --> 14:36.708
Did you shower?

14:37.416 --> 14:39.958
Ma, don't worry.
I'm not gonna sully our puja.

14:52.375 --> 14:54.666
We can't just lock
our doors at night

14:54.750 --> 14:56.875
and pretend that everything's copacetic.

14:57.458 --> 14:58.458
This is crazy.

14:58.541 --> 15:01.000
You were the one who tried
to beat him with the bat.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.166
Maybe it is you who are crazy.

15:05.625 --> 15:07.833
I can't believe
you're taking his side.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.666
He is trying his very best.
Just let him be.

15:17.208 --> 15:20.000
I found Dr. Goodwin's number
in my backpack, and I…

15:20.083 --> 15:24.500
I have not seen Dada
for one whole year since Baba died.

15:25.916 --> 15:28.208
He came all the way out from California.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
I want to enjoy my time with him.

15:31.875 --> 15:32.708
One week.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.500
That is all.

15:39.375 --> 15:40.208
Fine.

15:41.916 --> 15:45.041
Hey. No!
No, you know I'm allergic to flowers.

15:45.125 --> 15:48.208
It's a blessing.
You cannot reject a blessing!

15:50.041 --> 15:51.083
Cypseline.

15:52.958 --> 15:54.666
Definition, please.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.791
Louder, Payal!

15:57.791 --> 16:02.291
Enunciate! Remember.

16:02.833 --> 16:05.208
Mrs. Gandhi, if you're gonna stay
in the kitchen, I really need you--

16:05.291 --> 16:08.125
Just sorry. Sorry. My lips are sealed.

16:09.958 --> 16:12.416
Of or relating to the swifts.

16:14.375 --> 16:16.125
Language of origin?

16:17.041 --> 16:18.333
Greek and English.

16:18.833 --> 16:21.375
Are there any alternate pronunciations?

16:21.458 --> 16:22.291
Nope.

16:23.791 --> 16:26.041
-Part of speech?
-Adjective.

16:26.708 --> 16:30.416
-Can you please repeat the word?
-Cypseline.

16:31.208 --> 16:32.583
Cypseline.

16:33.666 --> 16:38.125
S-I-P…

16:38.208 --> 16:44.041
S-A-L-I-N-E.

16:44.666 --> 16:45.500
Cypseline.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.625
That is correct.

16:50.708 --> 16:51.750
Good job, Payal.

16:51.833 --> 16:55.250
Mm. My smart girl!

16:55.791 --> 16:57.333
Pizza bags for everyone.

17:05.583 --> 17:07.291
That wasn't right though.

17:07.875 --> 17:09.666
No, but look, you were close.

17:10.958 --> 17:12.333
Thanks, Monica Didi.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.416
Hey, hey. You're gonna be okay, all right?

17:15.500 --> 17:17.500
Let's just get through
some more of these drills

17:17.583 --> 17:21.500
and we'll get you right back on track.

17:26.833 --> 17:29.458
Oh, banana chips.
Let's get the banana chips for sure.

17:32.791 --> 17:34.708
Yo, Thums Up!

17:34.791 --> 17:37.875
Yo, Baba used to buy us
crates of this stuff growing up.

17:37.958 --> 17:40.708
I'm only here because Mom wants me here.

17:40.791 --> 17:42.708
Look, for the last time,

17:42.791 --> 17:46.916
I am so sorry for joking around
and going full Liam Neeson on your date.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.041
It's kinda hard to tell
when you're joking or not.

17:49.125 --> 17:50.875
Man, this stuff's like crack.

17:50.958 --> 17:53.291
It's got five times
the amount of caffeine as Coke.

17:53.375 --> 17:54.208
Do you want one?

17:55.041 --> 17:57.500
-Well, I want it.

17:57.583 --> 17:58.916
Hey, hey, hey!

17:59.000 --> 18:00.625
Hey, Jimit uncle, don't worry,
I'll pay for it.

18:00.708 --> 18:02.916
-Okay, 'cause I have cameras now.
-Uh-huh.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.958
Mm, "Thums Up! Too fun <i>thandak!"</i>

18:07.041 --> 18:09.041
Do you-- Do you wanna sip? It's so good!

18:09.125 --> 18:10.875
Come on, come on. Seriously.

18:13.541 --> 18:14.375
Crack.

18:15.666 --> 18:17.666
What does "too fun <i>thandak" </i>even mean?

18:17.750 --> 18:19.458
Uh, "cold fun," I think?

18:19.541 --> 18:21.208
Like, <i>thandak </i>means "cold,"
so yeah, "cold fun."

18:21.291 --> 18:23.750
Actually, "taste the thunder."

18:23.833 --> 18:26.000
"Too fun <i>thandak…"</i>
…means nothing.

18:27.250 --> 18:29.208
-We have a sale on mangoes.
-Mm.

18:29.875 --> 18:32.458
-I'm pretty sure it's "too fun <i>thandak."</i>
-Me too.

18:32.541 --> 18:34.916
Uncle, too fun <i>thandak!</i>

18:35.750 --> 18:38.083
-I heard that.

18:38.166 --> 18:40.208
I can't believe
Mom let us drink this stuff.

18:40.291 --> 18:42.500
-It definitely stunted my growth.
-Definitely.

18:42.583 --> 18:45.041
You can come out to California
whenever you want.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.875
I… I can't.

18:48.875 --> 18:50.458
Well, you'd have a place to stay.

18:50.541 --> 18:53.625
You know, uh…
I could take a day or two off from work.

18:53.708 --> 18:56.791
We could drive to the coast, or…
Oh, maybe we could hit the beach.

18:56.875 --> 18:58.583
-I hate the beach.
-Oh.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.750
-Sonny!
-Hey, buddy. How you been?

19:01.833 --> 19:03.291
-I'm good. How are you?
-Good.

19:04.250 --> 19:05.083
Yeah.

19:09.083 --> 19:09.916
Monica.

19:11.208 --> 19:12.041
Rahul.

19:14.333 --> 19:18.000
Wait, the two of you still aren't beefing
over the spelling bee, are you?

19:18.083 --> 19:21.333
What beef? I won fair and square.

19:21.416 --> 19:25.375
Oh, depends on what your definition
of winning is.

19:29.791 --> 19:31.333
-Oh, it's good to see you.
-You too.

19:31.416 --> 19:34.333
That was cute.
No, it was not cute at all.

19:34.416 --> 19:36.333
-You guys are weird.

19:36.416 --> 19:40.916
-So I see you're living the LA life, huh?
-Yeah, man, things are pretty good.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.458
But, uh, dating is not so hot.

19:44.541 --> 19:47.041
I was seeing this Pakistani girl.

19:47.125 --> 19:50.708
She actually was, uh,
Miss Pakistan-America.

19:50.791 --> 19:53.958
-Agoura. Super hot!
-Oh, wow.

20:00.125 --> 20:01.291
-Really.
-Yeah?

20:01.375 --> 20:04.416
-Yeah.
-And what about the water…

20:04.500 --> 20:05.333
Boony.

20:07.166 --> 20:08.541
You had the roti last time.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.666
Brother's turn. No.

20:12.750 --> 20:14.708
Um, fair is fair, Boony.

20:20.416 --> 20:21.708
Here you go, Boony.

20:23.625 --> 20:25.833
Enough is enough, no?

20:30.208 --> 20:32.416
-I can handle myself.

20:33.791 --> 20:37.333
Um, hey, Boony, I think Ma's list
only said only two boxes of mangoes.

20:37.416 --> 20:38.500
Oh, wow.

20:38.583 --> 20:40.750
"You can never have too many mangoes."

20:40.833 --> 20:44.500
You know who said that?
It wasn't me, it was Gandhi.

20:45.208 --> 20:46.041
Indira.

20:46.791 --> 20:48.708
No, honestly, it was Mother Teresa.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.958
-Um…
-I don't think she ever said that.

20:52.916 --> 20:55.083
Fine, fine. I'll put it back.

20:55.166 --> 20:57.958
Just remember, don't @ me
when you run out of lassi.

20:58.041 --> 21:00.791
And you will. You will.

21:00.875 --> 21:02.708
Hey, uncle, we won't.

21:03.291 --> 21:04.708
Don't worry, uncle. We're not gonna @ you.

21:04.791 --> 21:06.208
He has a Twitter?

21:07.333 --> 21:09.625
Hey, you coming
to Baba's anniversary?

21:09.708 --> 21:11.458
Yeah, of course. We'll be at the havan.

21:13.833 --> 21:14.708
Don't invite uncle.

21:16.333 --> 21:18.125
-Yeah, pay for this.
-Yes, yes.

21:22.250 --> 21:26.333
According to Wombat,
you were gonna marry Lonnie Erling,

21:26.416 --> 21:29.083
live in Tahiti in a shack,
drive a Jeep Wrangler,

21:29.166 --> 21:30.875
and have 16 kids.

21:30.958 --> 21:33.625
-Wombat told no lies.

21:33.708 --> 21:36.500
Dude, everyone wanted to get their hands
on Wombat back in the day.

21:36.583 --> 21:38.958
-Mm-hm.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.458
Wombat rules!

21:44.083 --> 21:45.375
I mean, who didn't wanna know

21:45.458 --> 21:49.083
if Nathan or Curtis gave you
three carnations on Valentine's Day?

21:49.166 --> 21:53.625
Mm. Nathan, three.
Curtis, two. Rajiv, one.

21:53.708 --> 21:56.083
-Ugh. Justin, one.

21:56.166 --> 21:59.208
-Monica, one.
-Aw.

21:59.291 --> 22:00.291
What was my count?

22:01.500 --> 22:04.083
-Trey, one. Andrew, one.
-Mm-hm.

22:04.166 --> 22:06.250
Krista, duh, one.

22:07.041 --> 22:09.416
Richie, one.

22:09.500 --> 22:12.333
Damn, lover boy planted the seed
in middle-school.

22:12.416 --> 22:14.166
Stop, stop.

22:14.250 --> 22:17.125
That hook-up was a one-time amalgamation.

22:18.250 --> 22:20.958
Well, he came into Jay's last night
looking for you.

22:22.125 --> 22:25.916
-He did?
-No!

22:26.000 --> 22:28.916
You totally care
even though you're pretending not to.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.083
So now you're subterfuging me?

22:31.625 --> 22:35.458
-Basic English for basic bitch.
-You're tricking me.

22:36.416 --> 22:37.875
-Well, you're retaining the subject…
-Mm.

22:37.958 --> 22:41.125
-…because you care so much.

22:42.750 --> 22:44.708
Do you remember
what we promised each other?

22:46.708 --> 22:48.000
Yes.

22:48.083 --> 22:49.916
We promised each other that we would…

22:50.708 --> 22:53.541
get out of this boring-ass town
and do big things.

22:54.333 --> 22:55.166
Big.

23:00.583 --> 23:01.625
Does it bug you?

23:02.583 --> 23:03.416
What?

23:04.208 --> 23:08.916
That you're still here in Greensburg,
doing the opposite of big things.

23:09.000 --> 23:09.833
No.

23:13.416 --> 23:16.000
Honestly, I'm just happy to be alive.

23:16.083 --> 23:18.875
Don't ever OD on me again, okay?

23:18.958 --> 23:22.291
The only thing I'm OD'ing on
is sweet motherfucking fish, bitch.

23:30.541 --> 23:32.208
I think about that night a lot.

23:33.708 --> 23:35.125
Why? Does it bug you?

23:36.000 --> 23:38.708
Yeah. Yeah, I guess it does.

23:39.291 --> 23:41.416
Well, good. It should.

23:44.375 --> 23:48.750
You know, Mon, I Google
all the "Where Are They Now?" articles

23:48.833 --> 23:50.166
about past Scramps…

23:51.416 --> 23:56.000
and they're all doing sick shit,
like working for NASA, playing pro poker,

23:56.708 --> 23:58.458
making billions off start-ups.

23:59.416 --> 24:00.333
Yeah.

24:01.916 --> 24:03.958
You know, you need to be
on those articles.

24:06.416 --> 24:08.375
Dada needs to take his meds.

24:09.375 --> 24:11.375
And you need to stop worrying
about other people

24:11.458 --> 24:13.458
and start worrying about yourself.

24:13.541 --> 24:15.583
You could be a life coach.

24:15.666 --> 24:19.208
-Bartender, life coach.

24:19.291 --> 24:22.166
Same thing.

24:59.041 --> 25:00.458
Ma, are you awake?

25:03.750 --> 25:05.583
-How are you doing, hm?

25:05.666 --> 25:06.875
Come in, come in.

25:21.958 --> 25:24.541
-I don't want you to die.

25:27.583 --> 25:29.708
So morbid.

25:31.625 --> 25:34.708
Keep up that negative attitude,
I probably will die.

25:34.791 --> 25:36.541
-I'm serious.
-Mm.

25:36.625 --> 25:39.291
Our little Boony is always very serious.

25:41.750 --> 25:43.625
Am I taking bad care of you?

25:47.625 --> 25:49.000
Of course not.

25:52.666 --> 25:54.750
That's not why I called Dada here.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.708
Then why did you call Dada?

26:01.416 --> 26:02.916
When God takes me--

26:03.000 --> 26:04.666
-Positive attitude.
-Yes, yes.

26:07.875 --> 26:09.875
The past has passed, Boony.

26:13.208 --> 26:17.166
-And when I am in the grand upstairs…
-Cheater.

26:17.250 --> 26:20.041
-When I am upstairs…

26:21.541 --> 26:24.083
…Dada's the only family
you have downstairs.

26:25.666 --> 26:27.125
It's not fair.

26:32.250 --> 26:35.166
Oh, you remember
where the safe deposit key is, yes?

26:35.250 --> 26:38.500
-Now who's the saturnine one?
-Mm.

26:39.208 --> 26:41.958
I have a lot of family gold there.

26:44.208 --> 26:46.291
You can sell it if you get into trouble.

26:47.041 --> 26:49.458
It's, uh, under the bed…

26:50.250 --> 26:52.750
in the Payless shoe box

26:52.833 --> 26:56.083
wrapped in a paper towel
under your wishbone collection.

26:57.333 --> 26:59.416
Good, good.

27:00.750 --> 27:03.625
I don't care about the jewelry.
I care about you.

27:06.750 --> 27:11.541
If you care about me, please,
please open your heart to Dada.

27:13.250 --> 27:15.875
I know. Mood stabilizers
have come a long way since we--

27:33.958 --> 27:37.500
You can't just make up
the words to the song.

27:39.833 --> 27:41.166
You know this part.

27:55.666 --> 27:58.000
-Cough.

28:00.250 --> 28:02.916
-Again? A big one this time.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.666
-Mm.

28:13.583 --> 28:16.583
-Relax, Jaya.

28:29.583 --> 28:33.208
You can tell them. They are adults.

28:35.500 --> 28:41.666
There's, uh, zero improvement
from my first diagnosis three weeks ago.

28:43.125 --> 28:47.166
Her triiodothyronine and thyroxine
hormones appear inflamed.

28:47.250 --> 28:49.875
But we're doing
everything right though.

28:49.958 --> 28:54.083
She's taking all the pills you prescribed,
and her diet is--

28:54.166 --> 28:56.291
Well, we cheat every now and then, but--

28:56.375 --> 29:00.958
-I cannot give up hush puppies for good.
-Jaya, you must.

29:01.041 --> 29:03.625
Her meals have been mostly pretty healthy.

29:03.708 --> 29:05.833
Yeah, uh, just salads and sabzis.

29:05.916 --> 29:07.458
Oh, and your dal.

29:08.250 --> 29:11.333
Do you know that Dada
makes the most expert moong dal?

29:12.708 --> 29:13.875
I'll have to try it.

29:16.916 --> 29:19.916
If Ma's not getting any better,
maybe we should take her to the hospital.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.125
Oh, Boony, hospitals.
Hospitals are so depressing.

29:23.625 --> 29:27.500
Jaya's heart rate is up.
Is there any stress in her life?

29:31.708 --> 29:33.916
Dada and Boony.

29:35.250 --> 29:37.041
They cannot get along.

29:38.791 --> 29:41.041
I-I don't-- I don't know what to do.

29:41.125 --> 29:45.000
I don't know what a dying mother
is supposed to do

29:45.083 --> 29:47.250
-when her children cannot…
-Jaya, Jaya.

29:47.333 --> 29:49.166
…come together and support.
-Calm down, okay?

29:49.250 --> 29:50.916
They are always fighting.

29:51.916 --> 29:53.458
Okay, you must rest.

29:53.541 --> 29:57.500
Nothing is ever good between them.
There is no hope.

29:57.583 --> 29:59.833
-Relax, okay?

29:59.916 --> 30:03.083
Come. You must rest.

30:10.583 --> 30:11.958
Dr. Ali, thank you so much--

30:12.041 --> 30:15.583
Your mother's fatigue, depression,
and stress levels is a direct symptom

30:15.666 --> 30:17.291
-of you and you fighting.

30:17.375 --> 30:19.500
That's physical assault,
and I'm not gonna take it.

30:19.583 --> 30:21.916
You Indian kids in America
have no shame, huh?

30:23.541 --> 30:26.250
Your hardworking parents
sacrificed so much for you,

30:26.333 --> 30:29.166
and you just take, take, take,
and you throw it all away.

30:29.250 --> 30:30.541
-Um, Auntie, I--

30:33.125 --> 30:36.708
You are both blessed with smart brains

30:36.791 --> 30:39.375
and connected by a deep love
for your mother.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.250
You are in a versus.

30:44.583 --> 30:47.541
Like Ram and Lakshman.

30:47.625 --> 30:48.958
Krishna and Arjuna.

30:50.041 --> 30:51.583
Farhan and Zoya.

30:52.916 --> 30:54.500
Farhan and Zoya? Who are…

30:54.583 --> 30:55.541
Akhtar.

30:57.875 --> 31:00.375
They are brother-sister
Bollywood power duo.

31:01.458 --> 31:02.625
No?

31:02.708 --> 31:03.875
<i>Dil Dhadakne Do.</i>

31:05.125 --> 31:06.416
<i>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara?</i>

31:06.500 --> 31:08.875
-I don't know that one.
-Yeah, I've never heard of it.

31:08.958 --> 31:10.875
Google it, you fucking fools!

31:13.250 --> 31:18.833
Your mother
was my first friend in America.

31:19.708 --> 31:22.333
She is like my sister.

31:23.708 --> 31:26.375
Uh, actually, I don't like my sisters
really all that much.

31:26.458 --> 31:30.125
They take all my money. But I love Jaya.

31:31.916 --> 31:33.625
She's perfect.

31:36.583 --> 31:38.125
Do something special for her.

31:39.083 --> 31:40.750
Together.

31:42.333 --> 31:44.291
It will lift her spirits.

31:45.375 --> 31:46.250
Okay?

31:46.958 --> 31:47.958
Okay, <i>beta?</i>

31:48.791 --> 31:49.750
-Okay, <i>beta?</i>
-Yeah, oh--

31:49.833 --> 31:51.250
-Yes.
-Do something.

31:51.333 --> 31:53.000
-Mm-hm.
-Do something.

31:53.083 --> 31:56.333
-Mm-hm.
-Yes. Something.

32:01.958 --> 32:04.750
You know, I'm always
slightly disappointed with udon.

32:04.833 --> 32:09.541
I want it to be spicy like ramen,
but it's just fucking soup.

32:11.958 --> 32:13.750
Frosty Shack never disappoints.

32:16.625 --> 32:18.750
Are you cool putting this show together
with Sonny?

32:19.541 --> 32:20.916
Sort of.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.291
We're basically just concentrating
on rehearsing the acts and not much else.

32:27.541 --> 32:28.416
<i>Becquerel.</i>

32:28.500 --> 32:33.541
<i>B-E-C-Q-U-E-R-E-L. Becquerel.</i>

32:34.208 --> 32:39.625
<i>The SI unit of radioactivity corresponding</i>
<i>to one disintegration per second.</i>

32:41.625 --> 32:44.833
Hey, you're Sunshine's sister, right?

32:44.916 --> 32:47.125
Yeah, I'm Sonny's sister, Monica.

32:47.208 --> 32:48.833
Yeah, right on. I'm Javi.

32:48.916 --> 32:50.875
I used to play soccer with him
back in the day.

32:50.958 --> 32:52.958
-Cool.
-Tell him I said what's up.

32:53.041 --> 32:54.208
I will.

33:00.583 --> 33:02.083
-I know.
-What are you doing?

33:02.166 --> 33:03.750
Checking out Javi's butt.

33:03.833 --> 33:05.541
-It's so obvious.

33:10.541 --> 33:12.000
I don't like the mustache.

33:13.083 --> 33:14.416
-Okay, where's my cane?
-Pretty creepy.

33:14.500 --> 33:15.333
Fuck.

33:16.375 --> 33:17.416
Okay, go team.

33:18.166 --> 33:19.166
Why are you so sweaty?

33:28.250 --> 33:30.041
-Cue music!
-Oh, shit. Sorry.

33:31.208 --> 33:34.041
-Come one, come all,

33:34.125 --> 33:40.375
to the exciting, popular,
world-renowned <i>Funny Sonny Show!</i>

33:40.458 --> 33:41.625
Whoo!

33:41.708 --> 33:47.208
I'm your emcee with the key,
Sir Rupert Coldwallace!

33:47.291 --> 33:50.041
Welcome to my home, Rupert.

33:50.125 --> 33:52.541
Ma, you can't break the fourth wall.

33:52.625 --> 33:54.958
Pretend you're at
the Benedum Center, okay?

33:56.250 --> 34:00.458
Entertainers from all over
the multiverse and beyond

34:00.541 --> 34:02.541
have been gathered and waiting

34:02.625 --> 34:06.708
for this one moment in their lives
to be funny…

34:06.791 --> 34:08.375
to be savvy…

34:09.125 --> 34:11.791
to show!

34:12.791 --> 34:18.250
Our first performance is a muscle man
who has conquered weights

34:18.333 --> 34:21.708
on all four corners of the Earth.

34:21.791 --> 34:23.916
-The Earth is round.
-Ugh!

34:24.000 --> 34:24.958
Just saying!

34:25.458 --> 34:31.708
Presenting Manish
the Magnificent Muscle Man!

34:31.791 --> 34:34.083
Whoo!

34:34.166 --> 34:36.916
You forgot to play
the Muscle Man music.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.375
I didn't want to miss my cue,
I told you we should've hired

34:38.458 --> 34:39.541
Krista as the stage manager.

34:39.625 --> 34:41.208
-You're the worst!
-No, you're the worst!

34:41.291 --> 34:45.041
-Dada, Boony, stop fighting.

34:45.125 --> 34:47.000
We're not Dada and Boony!

34:47.083 --> 34:50.083
Then Rupert and Manish, behave!

35:00.958 --> 35:03.375
-Ah! Whew!
-O-ho!

35:03.458 --> 35:06.083
Uh, all right. Ah, yeah.

35:09.375 --> 35:12.333
-Whoo! Whoo!
-Ooh!

35:13.041 --> 35:14.458
-Pretty good, right?
-Yeah.

35:19.958 --> 35:20.791
One second.

35:20.875 --> 35:23.875
-I forgot my weights.
-You forgot-- That's your only prop!

35:23.958 --> 35:25.416
-Okay, just-- just get out of my way.
-How could you--

35:25.500 --> 35:26.333
Get out of my way.

35:49.875 --> 35:51.958
Check out my Swipe Right Diet online

35:52.041 --> 35:54.708
and join our ever growing team
of salesmen.

35:54.791 --> 35:57.375
Are you seriously recruiting Ma
for your pyramid scheme?

35:57.458 --> 35:58.333
It's not a pyramid scheme, okay?

35:58.416 --> 36:00.583
It's a lucrative
business opportunity for entrepreneurs.

36:02.458 --> 36:04.875
Check it out.
I'm very close to Emerald status.

36:04.958 --> 36:08.166
-Mm.
-There's some really attractive people.

36:08.250 --> 36:09.625
-I think-- Is that--
-Get in here!

36:09.708 --> 36:12.208
-Oh, is it mine? Okay!
-Okay, you have to help me take this out.

36:12.291 --> 36:14.083
-Okay. Okay, Jesus!
-You have to help me!

36:14.166 --> 36:15.875
Couldn't you just, like,
play the flute or something?

36:15.958 --> 36:17.250
No, I don't know how to play the flute.

36:17.333 --> 36:18.166
Well, you don't know
how to play this either.

36:18.250 --> 36:21.166
-Yes, I do! I took that one lesson.
-Yeah, whatever.

36:23.125 --> 36:25.000
-Take your weights with you.
-I will, I will!

36:32.041 --> 36:33.833
You gotta take my mustache!

36:33.916 --> 36:35.958
This is disgusting, what the fuck?

36:42.875 --> 36:47.791
My music,
Lily Chakravarty's music, is for lovers.

36:48.916 --> 36:52.291
Kissing in the monstoon f--

36:53.083 --> 36:57.833
My music,
Lily Chakravarty's music, is for lovers.

36:58.708 --> 37:03.250
A stolen glance
from a second-story window…

37:03.333 --> 37:06.166
…kissing in the monsoon floods,

37:06.250 --> 37:11.000
-romantic candlelight goat curry dinners.

37:12.083 --> 37:14.541
Ah, join me, Lily Chakravarty,

37:14.625 --> 37:17.833
as I sing my hit song that I learned

37:17.916 --> 37:21.083
from Shammi Ji at Hindu temple camp.

37:21.166 --> 37:24.583
He ended up molesting
some of the tween girl campers,

37:24.666 --> 37:25.708
but…

37:26.458 --> 37:29.375
…that is neither here nor there,
you know?

37:30.250 --> 37:33.500
Judge the art, not the artist.

37:33.583 --> 37:36.166
You know, Lily, in this political climate,
you should judge the artist.

37:36.250 --> 37:38.875
Shut up, Dada!
Just get backstage and remember your--

37:38.958 --> 37:40.958
Okay! Okay, okay, Jesus.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.791
Yep, that definitely sounds
like a child molester song.

38:13.875 --> 38:15.708
-Shh, just get your friggin'--

38:15.791 --> 38:18.375
-You just remember your cues.
-Okay.

38:23.041 --> 38:27.625
It has been an
absolute honor and phenomenal pleasure

38:27.708 --> 38:31.750
to perform for you,
the greatest audience in the world.

38:31.833 --> 38:35.791
Now please enjoy
the soul-stirring bhajan…

38:38.125 --> 38:39.750
Can you play the fucking bhajan?

38:39.833 --> 38:41.541
Oh, fuck, dude, I don't know…

38:41.625 --> 38:44.291
Enjoy the soul-stirring bhajan

38:44.375 --> 38:48.458
as our next entertainers
prepare to dazzle you

38:48.541 --> 38:52.375
with an extraordinary, excellent
finale number.

38:53.750 --> 38:54.750
Namaskar.

38:55.625 --> 38:58.375
-Can you help?
-Yeah, I thought I was-- I was just…

38:59.541 --> 39:01.708
Finally, you got a--
You got a cue right, finally.

39:08.791 --> 39:11.041
Right. I-I gotta get ready.
You gotta go do something.

39:11.125 --> 39:13.958
-Yeah, but we didn't rehearse this.
-Just sing something.

39:16.416 --> 39:17.708
-Oh, fuck.

39:20.958 --> 39:26.916
-Okay, okay. Oh, my God.

39:31.500 --> 39:32.583
-Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready, shut up.

39:32.666 --> 39:34.083
Dude, I was-- That was good.

40:05.708 --> 40:07.250
-Oh, shit!
-You gotta keep going!

40:07.333 --> 40:09.041
-Okay! Ow!
-You're not dancing!

40:10.958 --> 40:15.083
Whoa, we are dancing, dancing!

40:40.208 --> 40:41.541
-Ah, Boony.

40:42.250 --> 40:43.583
That is not a circle!

40:44.583 --> 40:49.041
That looks like Motu Mamu's belly.
It's small, then very large.

40:49.125 --> 40:51.833
You know what?
That does look like Motu Mamu's belly.

40:51.916 --> 40:54.083
-It's lopsided.
-Uh, I'm trying.

40:54.166 --> 40:55.250
You know, it's hard to maintain

40:55.333 --> 40:57.916
the exact same pressure
as it circumvolves.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.458
Mm.

40:59.958 --> 41:00.958
You could just say rotate.

41:01.041 --> 41:03.375
All right. No fighting, please.

41:03.458 --> 41:05.375
-Flour is your best friend.

41:05.458 --> 41:07.125
Krista is my best friend.

41:07.208 --> 41:09.875
-And Richie is your boyfriend.
-Shut up!

41:11.041 --> 41:14.250
-Who is Richie? Richie?
-He's just a friend.

41:17.041 --> 41:19.083
If you get pregnant,
do not have an abortion.

41:19.166 --> 41:20.375
-I will raise the baby.
-Ma!

41:20.458 --> 41:22.166
-Oh, my God!

41:22.250 --> 41:23.958
You're so dead!

41:28.041 --> 41:30.583
-Dada, let me taste the shahi.
-Mm.

41:30.666 --> 41:32.000
It's good. It's spicy.

41:33.375 --> 41:34.208
Mm.

41:38.583 --> 41:39.750
Needs more salt.

41:40.583 --> 41:41.416
Really?

41:43.125 --> 41:44.458
-I thought it was pretty--

41:44.541 --> 41:46.958
-It's pretty--
-You think too much, hm?

41:47.041 --> 41:49.416
All you have is the present.

41:49.500 --> 41:53.208
Past is past.
The future is not here.

41:53.291 --> 41:54.916
See? You know.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.833
I taught you one thing at least.
Put more salt.

42:04.833 --> 42:06.458
I was never good enough for you.

42:09.250 --> 42:10.208
Or for Baba.

42:14.750 --> 42:16.250
Boony was always the perfect one.

42:19.750 --> 42:21.291
I'm just your stupid son.

42:22.208 --> 42:24.416
Dada, are you joking?

42:27.041 --> 42:29.750
Hm. When did I say you are stupid?

42:33.000 --> 42:33.833
Every day.

42:35.500 --> 42:37.375
It's why I never wanted to come home.

42:39.125 --> 42:42.166
Baba would always ask me
about MBA this and grad school that.

42:42.833 --> 42:46.541
You know, all the other sons
are lawyers, doctors, and engineers.

42:46.625 --> 42:47.625
You know, like Rahul.

42:48.958 --> 42:51.958
-And I'm just a stupid trainer at the gym.
-All right, all right, all right.

42:52.458 --> 42:54.916
You know what, Baba and I,
we made mistakes.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.625
And y-you are great. Just as you are.

43:01.833 --> 43:03.208
If I'm so great…

43:07.958 --> 43:09.333
where is my diploma?

43:13.125 --> 43:15.625
Where is my framed graduation picture?

43:19.958 --> 43:22.750
Where is my art work on the fridge, hm?

43:24.541 --> 43:26.208
-Huh?

43:39.666 --> 43:41.875
Uh, I-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

43:41.958 --> 43:43.208
Boony! Boony, Boony.

43:43.291 --> 43:44.500
These pictures…

43:45.916 --> 43:47.875
They're great, Boony, huh?

43:47.958 --> 43:50.250
I didn't-- I didn't mean to do--
You're such a good artist.

43:50.333 --> 43:54.458
They're great,
I didn't mean to…

43:55.625 --> 43:59.750
It's all right. It's all right.
It is a tough day for all of us.

44:00.791 --> 44:03.541
-Oh, baby.

44:03.625 --> 44:05.750
-Oh, Dada, no…

44:05.833 --> 44:09.250
-It's-It's okay. It's okay.
-I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.

44:11.791 --> 44:12.625
Boony?

44:13.500 --> 44:14.333
Oh, fuck.

44:21.166 --> 44:23.916
-You should be resting.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.958
Well, Dr. Ali says that I should get
some fresh air, so…

44:45.833 --> 44:48.208
Not that the air up here is very fresh.

44:52.041 --> 44:55.125
-Where's Dada?
-He's lying down. He was tired.

44:56.041 --> 44:58.041
There's nothing wrong with getting help.

44:58.625 --> 45:02.666
Yes, Boony, I know, but he is an adult,
and we cannot force him to get medication.

45:06.666 --> 45:07.875
I miss Baba.

45:10.958 --> 45:11.833
Me too.

45:15.125 --> 45:17.250
Dada does too, he just…

45:18.833 --> 45:24.666
He acts out when he has emotions.

45:25.250 --> 45:26.125
And you…

45:26.791 --> 45:30.875
You disconnect, you come up here,
you take your marinara.

45:30.958 --> 45:34.291
-Marinara?
-Yes, you take your marinara.

45:34.375 --> 45:35.875
What are you talking about…

45:36.375 --> 45:39.083
Oh, marijuana.

45:39.166 --> 45:40.166
-I don't smoke--
-Mm-hm.

45:43.375 --> 45:45.458
Okay, this is the first time I smoked.

45:49.500 --> 45:50.333
Okay.

45:54.500 --> 45:56.666
-Hey, can I try?
-Really?

45:57.666 --> 45:58.500
Yeah.

46:00.833 --> 46:03.416
You know, my friends with cancer,
they love it.

46:03.500 --> 46:06.000
And-And it's basically legal, yeah?

46:08.291 --> 46:09.208
Okay.

46:14.125 --> 46:15.375
Okay.

46:31.125 --> 46:32.833
-How does it--
-Put it to your lips,

46:32.916 --> 46:34.708
and you just suck it in.

46:36.833 --> 46:38.458
Okay, okay. Not too much, not too much.

46:38.541 --> 46:40.000
That's it. Good.

46:40.791 --> 46:43.958
-Okay. Are you okay?

46:44.041 --> 46:44.875
Here, here.

46:46.791 --> 46:49.208
It just burns
your throat a little.

46:49.291 --> 46:51.375
-Just…

46:58.375 --> 47:01.375
This is… weird.

47:16.291 --> 47:17.125
You know…

47:19.750 --> 47:24.750
Dada, he stopped himself this time
before he got violent, that is…

47:27.166 --> 47:28.250
That is progress.

47:30.041 --> 47:31.125
I guess it is.

47:37.416 --> 47:40.291
-Do you have any snacks or…
-Yes.

48:04.500 --> 48:07.666
-You know, this was Baba's favorite song.

48:08.916 --> 48:09.833
Mine too.

48:40.083 --> 48:41.541
-Stop!

48:41.625 --> 48:43.583
-Stop!

48:44.708 --> 48:46.000
-Stop! Ugh!

48:49.208 --> 48:50.375
<i>Spoliator.</i>

48:50.458 --> 48:55.583
<i>S-P-O-L-I-A-T-O-R. Spoliator.</i>

48:55.666 --> 48:59.208
<i>One who plunders, pillages,</i>
<i>despoils, or robs.</i>

48:59.291 --> 49:01.958
Dumb brown turd!
Never teaming up with you again.

49:02.041 --> 49:04.791
What the fuck?
Get back here, you little piece of shit!

49:04.875 --> 49:07.333
-Come here!
-Let me go!

49:07.416 --> 49:10.333
Not until you promise me
never to fuck with my girl Payal again.

49:10.416 --> 49:14.833
Who, the president
of the role-playing wizard club?

49:14.916 --> 49:16.041
Pile of shit!

49:16.708 --> 49:21.125
Ew, gross!
Fine, fine, I won't mess with her!

49:24.291 --> 49:26.333
Hey, that's mine, give it back!

49:26.916 --> 49:31.125
Just Venmoed Payal a hundred bucks
for that fancy handbook you aggregated.

49:31.208 --> 49:33.625
-Get out of my face.

49:35.083 --> 49:36.208
You're pathetic.

49:36.291 --> 49:40.000
You got nothing else to do
than live at home in your mom's basement

49:40.083 --> 49:43.083
and beat up little kids
in your spare time.

49:43.875 --> 49:45.250
I don't live in the basement!

49:46.416 --> 49:49.458
I'm on the second floor.
I have my own bathroom, you know that.

49:49.541 --> 49:50.541
Let's get your stuff.

49:53.625 --> 49:54.500
You okay?

49:54.583 --> 49:57.916
Yeah. You didn't have to do that.
I can handle them.

49:58.000 --> 49:58.833
I know.

49:59.583 --> 50:02.625
I wish someone had helped me
when I was getting bullied in school.

50:03.125 --> 50:06.583
-Didn't Dada help you?
-Yeah, I guess he did.

50:07.750 --> 50:09.916
Is he still sick?

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
Yeah.

50:13.083 --> 50:14.833
So you got bullied?

50:14.916 --> 50:18.000
Yeah, Annie DiMarco
called me "clam chowder," and it stuck.

50:18.083 --> 50:19.916
-Oh, you think that's funny?

50:20.000 --> 50:21.916
Well, kinda.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.750
Clam chowder,
and your last name is Chowdry.

50:24.833 --> 50:26.375
I-I-I like clam chowder.

50:26.458 --> 50:28.291
Clam chowder is bomb!

50:29.375 --> 50:30.625
Leslie's right, though.

50:31.333 --> 50:33.625
-I'm dumb.
-You're not dumb.

50:34.958 --> 50:38.833
Now, let's get you home
and get you some new RPG shit.

50:55.500 --> 50:57.500
I still got it.

50:58.083 --> 50:59.750
Well, yeah, that's the lowest rung.

51:01.083 --> 51:02.041
Do I sniff a challenge?

51:03.583 --> 51:06.583
Gotta defend my title. Next rung.

51:06.666 --> 51:07.875
Gauntlet thrown!

51:09.458 --> 51:10.583
Boony, are you sure?

51:10.666 --> 51:12.708
-Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
-Okay.

51:12.791 --> 51:15.916
Maybe we should advise a doctor
before you jump or something.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.375
I don't want you to get hurt.

51:17.458 --> 51:18.500
-Okay.
-I'm just looking out for you.

51:18.583 --> 51:19.666
-Okay.

51:24.250 --> 51:26.833
Oh, my God!

51:26.916 --> 51:29.000
Okay, relax, okay?
Don't celebrate just yet.

51:29.875 --> 51:31.083
-Oh, I'm gonna celebrate.
-Okay.

52:00.791 --> 52:03.041
-Oh, my God!
-You won't be celebrating after this.

52:03.625 --> 52:06.416
-Uh, this should be…
-Oh, you'll never clear that.

52:06.500 --> 52:08.875
This is, like, what?
Like, an inch taller than you?

52:08.958 --> 52:10.791
-What?

52:21.625 --> 52:24.791
-Oh, shit!
-Oh, shit, I win, I win, I win!

52:24.875 --> 52:26.375
-All right, relax! Okay!
-I win, I win!

52:26.458 --> 52:28.375
-Okay, I-- You win, you win.
-I win, I win, I win!

52:28.458 --> 52:30.875
-You win. You don't need to rub it in.
-Ha-ha!

52:30.958 --> 52:32.916
-Well, yeah, I kind of do.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.708
You're the athlete in the fam.

52:35.291 --> 52:37.250
-I guess.

52:41.791 --> 52:43.583
This is now yours.

52:43.666 --> 52:45.083
What?

52:46.208 --> 52:49.291
Ha-ha! I'm a jump-jump beast!

52:49.375 --> 52:51.416
-That you are.

52:56.708 --> 52:57.791
You seem better.

52:58.958 --> 53:01.083
Yeah. Uh, I feel better.

53:02.125 --> 53:04.250
Must be that fresh Greensburg air.

53:09.583 --> 53:12.166
Wait. How come my name's on this?

53:13.083 --> 53:15.208
-Did you let me win?
-It's tea time for Ma.

53:15.291 --> 53:17.375
Yo, yo, I can kick your ass

53:17.458 --> 53:18.500
-fair and square.
-Mm-hm.

53:18.583 --> 53:19.833
-I don't need any special treatment!
-Uh-huh.

53:19.916 --> 53:21.916
-I demand a rematch immediately.
-Uh-huh.

53:52.875 --> 53:54.375
What do you think he's saying?

53:55.291 --> 53:56.125
Ouch.

54:14.250 --> 54:17.208
Do you think he uses that
on other fruit sometimes?

54:18.291 --> 54:20.666
Joshi Ji says <i>"chup."</i>

54:20.750 --> 54:23.041
Or Baba's soul will never reach nirvana.

54:33.416 --> 54:35.541
I don't think Joshi Ji ever said <i>"chup."</i>

55:17.666 --> 55:19.333
-Yeah. Fill it up.
-Mm-hm.

55:19.416 --> 55:21.125
-All the way.
-Okay, auntie.

55:21.208 --> 55:23.541
-Ooh, it's so hot. Mm.
-Okay, that's enough.

55:24.958 --> 55:27.791
-Yo, you want some? You good?
-I'm good.

55:27.875 --> 55:29.416
-Good.
-I'm wired.

55:29.500 --> 55:30.583
No more for you then.

55:32.583 --> 55:33.875
Hey, you want some chai?

55:34.500 --> 55:37.083
Oh, such a gentleman.

55:37.791 --> 55:40.125
Sonny, when are you gonna find a wife?

55:40.208 --> 55:41.416
Oh.

55:42.875 --> 55:46.583


55:49.708 --> 55:52.041
Well, if she has your genes,
I'm sure she is.

55:54.333 --> 55:55.500
<i>Cabotinage.</i>

55:56.208 --> 56:00.708
<i>C-A-B-O-T-I-N-A-G-E.</i>

56:00.791 --> 56:02.125
<i>Cabotinage.</i>

56:02.208 --> 56:04.833
<i>Behavior befitting a second-rate actor.</i>

56:04.916 --> 56:07.000
<i>Obvious playing to the audience.</i>

56:07.916 --> 56:11.041
-Hey, do you got a match for Scramp?
-Let me go!

56:11.125 --> 56:13.041
Well, but, yeah--
But Scramp, you're such a catch.

56:13.125 --> 56:15.000
-Stop it!
-Yeah, Boony.

56:15.083 --> 56:17.708
I think it is time for us
to take out the sandesh, no?

56:18.375 --> 56:19.458
Come on.

56:19.541 --> 56:21.833
Sonny, I'm on the market.

56:21.916 --> 56:23.666
-Oh.
-Like, I'm single.

56:23.750 --> 56:24.875
That's nice.

56:30.291 --> 56:31.750
Seems like he's doing better.

56:37.125 --> 56:41.041
You know, we all worshiped him
growing up, Sonny Dada.

56:41.708 --> 56:45.666
-Mm-hm.
-He was the only sporty Indian jock.

56:45.750 --> 56:49.500
He lettered in baseball,
tennis, and soccer.

56:49.583 --> 56:50.833
We all wanted to be him.

57:04.166 --> 57:05.125
What happened?

57:10.375 --> 57:11.416
Who broke the moorti?

57:13.166 --> 57:14.000
Huh?

57:14.541 --> 57:15.625
Who broke it?

57:16.125 --> 57:17.916
Baba, it was me.

57:22.375 --> 57:24.250
Come here. Come here.

57:27.750 --> 57:28.583
<i>Sorry.</i>

57:31.791 --> 57:33.833
Oh, shit. Do you guys need help?

57:34.416 --> 57:35.583
Uh, we got it.

57:36.250 --> 57:39.250
You know, Sashi auntie wants to bottle
your chai and sell it at her GNC.

57:39.750 --> 57:42.500
I've been trying
to get Monica to bottle it for years.

57:42.583 --> 57:43.583
She's a no-go.

57:44.208 --> 57:47.333
-Not even for a million dollars?
-Maybe for a million.

57:47.416 --> 57:51.375
-Oh, that's huge. She's negotiating.
-I want 15 percent for brokering the deal.

57:51.458 --> 57:53.208
-Ten.
-Twelve.

57:53.291 --> 57:55.958
-Fine.

57:56.041 --> 57:59.125
-Great!
-There we go.

58:03.875 --> 58:06.666
You know, Sonny protected you for so long.

58:07.291 --> 58:09.458
Maybe it's your turn to protect him.

58:17.291 --> 58:18.833
Whoo!

58:18.916 --> 58:20.750
-Ma, board's ready.
-Mm.

58:21.583 --> 58:22.708
I'm so tired.

58:23.541 --> 58:25.166
Why don't you play with Boony?

58:26.250 --> 58:27.666
Carrom dash, huh?

58:27.750 --> 58:29.500
-Baba's favorite game.
-Mm.

58:30.666 --> 58:34.041
-I'm kind of tired too.
-No, you can play one game.

58:35.000 --> 58:39.125
Yeah, come on, Boony.
I'll let you win.

58:39.208 --> 58:41.291
I don't need you to let me win.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.166
-Night, Mom.
-Mm.

58:54.083 --> 58:55.083
Ladies first.

58:55.166 --> 58:59.208
I don't see any ladies.
All I see is a bad-ass bitch.

58:59.291 --> 59:01.416
Okay, well, you know what?

59:01.500 --> 59:05.208
Bad-ass bitches go first.
You know what I mean?

59:08.458 --> 59:11.291
That was pretty good.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.375
-Ooh!
-I'm warming up.

59:16.458 --> 59:20.291
-Nice shot, nice shot.
-I'm just warming up.

59:21.916 --> 59:25.250
You know, I have to sell
two more Swipe Right packages

59:25.333 --> 59:26.875
and then I get to Emerald status.

59:28.166 --> 59:29.041
That's cool.

59:30.916 --> 59:33.250
If Ma buys
a Swipe Right package from you…

59:33.333 --> 59:36.208
-…I swear, I'll just--

59:36.291 --> 59:37.125
I'll…

59:37.916 --> 59:39.375
Uh, what?

59:40.500 --> 59:44.375
Ooh, five points.

59:44.458 --> 59:46.791
-You're on fire.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

59:46.875 --> 59:51.041
I don't know,
I'll, like, do something wacky.

59:51.125 --> 59:53.291
-Like move to Fiji or something.

59:53.375 --> 59:54.208
Do it.

59:55.041 --> 59:57.000
What? Move to Fiji? Okay.

59:57.083 --> 59:59.541
No, dummy.
Like, just move out of the house.

59:59.625 --> 1:00:01.541
Get an apartment
in Pittsburgh or something.

1:00:02.416 --> 1:00:07.458
Nah, I like it here. I like helping Ma.

1:00:07.541 --> 1:00:09.875
I like making
my students' dreams come true.

1:00:09.958 --> 1:00:11.583
Okay, well, what about your dreams?

1:00:12.208 --> 1:00:14.583
Boony, you should be working
in some research facility by now,

1:00:14.666 --> 1:00:15.750
making six figures.

1:00:18.083 --> 1:00:20.041
Yeah, it's like you got this noodle,

1:00:20.666 --> 1:00:23.708
but you do not want to boil the water
and you don't want to put the pasta in it

1:00:23.791 --> 1:00:25.250
so it cooks and becomes edible.

1:00:27.750 --> 1:00:30.958
Are you hungry?
Is that what this vituperation is about?

1:00:31.666 --> 1:00:33.416
Are you coming at me
with Missy Elliott lyrics?

1:00:33.500 --> 1:00:35.041
No one's perfect, okay?

1:00:38.041 --> 1:00:40.708
I wanna climb up that ladder one day
and you're not there.

1:00:41.791 --> 1:00:44.333
I want to see the walls
empty of all your pictures.

1:00:47.333 --> 1:00:48.291
I want to see your paints gone.

1:00:50.083 --> 1:00:55.541
I wanna not see the creepy eyes
of that fugly rabbit of yours.

1:00:55.625 --> 1:00:57.666
My rabbit's not fugly.

1:01:01.333 --> 1:01:02.916
-Oh!
-Does that me-- Does that count?

1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:04.166
-Yes!
-You shot off half the pieces

1:01:04.250 --> 1:01:05.125
off the board!

1:01:06.041 --> 1:01:09.000
-Insouciant.
-Definition, please.

1:01:09.666 --> 1:01:12.500
Light-hearted concern,
nonchalance.

1:01:12.583 --> 1:01:14.250
Uh, language of origin?

1:01:14.333 --> 1:01:15.583
French and Latin.

1:01:16.291 --> 1:01:18.958
-Are there any alternate pronunciations?
-No.

1:01:19.833 --> 1:01:22.708
-Part of speech?
-Adjective.

1:01:23.500 --> 1:01:26.750
-Can you please repeat the word?
-Insouciant.

1:01:26.833 --> 1:01:28.208
Insouciant.

1:01:28.291 --> 1:01:31.375
I-N-S-O-U…

1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:36.125
C-E-N-T.

1:01:36.208 --> 1:01:37.083
Insouciant.

1:01:37.916 --> 1:01:39.625
That is correct.

1:01:40.416 --> 1:01:44.416
It is A-N-T. Not correct at all.

1:01:44.500 --> 1:01:47.041
-Why can't you be more like Adithi?
-Mrs. Gandhi, just--

1:01:47.125 --> 1:01:48.916
And you!
What the hell are we paying you for?

1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:50.666
You're supposed to teach her
the correct spelling.

1:01:50.750 --> 1:01:53.875
I know, I know, it just takes Payal
a little more time to learn--

1:01:53.958 --> 1:01:56.583
Well-- Well, of course,
all learning, it takes time,

1:01:56.666 --> 1:01:59.500
but you're teaching her to lie
to her mother, her family.

1:02:00.333 --> 1:02:02.125
I don't wanna do the spelling bee!

1:02:02.791 --> 1:02:04.291
What did you say?

1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:07.791
I don't want to do it.

1:02:07.875 --> 1:02:10.125
Payal, you will do the spelling bee!

1:02:12.125 --> 1:02:14.250
If she doesn't want to do
the spelling bee this year,

1:02:14.333 --> 1:02:16.541
then maybe we can just prep her
for next year.

1:02:16.625 --> 1:02:18.500
Oh, no, no, no, no,
she will do it this year

1:02:18.583 --> 1:02:20.208
and go all the way to national.

1:02:20.291 --> 1:02:21.541
And if she doesn't win this year,

1:02:21.625 --> 1:02:23.541
then we'll do it again next year
and the year after that.

1:02:23.625 --> 1:02:24.500
It just doesn't seem--

1:02:24.583 --> 1:02:29.250
Monica, you can be as much of a failure
as you want to in your own life.

1:02:29.333 --> 1:02:32.875
Your mother really let you run wild,
especially after Radesh died,

1:02:32.958 --> 1:02:35.958
but you leave my daughter
out of your willy-nilly influence.

1:02:36.458 --> 1:02:38.666
-I just don't--
-This is it for today's session.

1:02:38.750 --> 1:02:41.333
I'm only paying you
out of respect for Jaya Didi.

1:02:42.625 --> 1:02:44.250
We no longer need your services.

1:02:54.708 --> 1:02:58.625
BCAs…

1:03:08.250 --> 1:03:09.958
-Hey.
-Oh, hey.

1:03:13.791 --> 1:03:17.041
-What's this?
-Oh, it's just, uh, some event swag.

1:03:17.958 --> 1:03:20.083
-A water bottle.
-Yeah, actually, it's really cool.

1:03:20.166 --> 1:03:22.416
You can put hot water
or cold water in there,

1:03:22.500 --> 1:03:23.416
and it stays the temperature.

1:03:23.500 --> 1:03:24.333
-Cool.
-Yeah.

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:50.500
Why would you send me this card?

1:03:52.041 --> 1:03:54.416
Oh, I don't know.
I guess I thought it was funny.

1:03:57.250 --> 1:03:58.458
But I don't like yoga.

1:04:02.750 --> 1:04:05.791
Oh, I thought you liked to work out, so…

1:04:05.875 --> 1:04:07.000
I hate yoga.

1:04:09.708 --> 1:04:11.333
I'm not even flexible.

1:04:13.333 --> 1:04:15.625
I mean, you…

1:04:16.666 --> 1:04:18.291
You know I don't like yoga.

1:04:18.375 --> 1:04:20.666
I mean, I like girls in yoga pants, but…

1:04:23.416 --> 1:04:25.000
I told you I don't like yoga.

1:04:30.625 --> 1:04:34.166
-Sonny Chowdry.

1:04:34.250 --> 1:04:36.791
Sunny is a girl's name.

1:04:36.875 --> 1:04:38.666
Sonny is not a girl's name.

1:04:40.416 --> 1:04:42.666
Why does everyone think
Indians love yoga, okay?

1:04:42.750 --> 1:04:43.916
Yoga is the worst!

1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:46.666
Yoga is for girls.

1:04:47.625 --> 1:04:49.833
Hm? Yoga is for girls.

1:04:49.916 --> 1:04:51.083
This is your fault.

1:04:51.166 --> 1:04:53.833
This is all your fault.

1:04:53.916 --> 1:04:55.875
Okay, Dada, come here, huh?

1:04:55.958 --> 1:04:59.458
-Come here.
-No, no, no. Yoga is for girls.

1:05:00.750 --> 1:05:04.125
And Sonny is a stupid name for a boy.

1:05:04.208 --> 1:05:07.625
-You can change your name.
-No, no, no. Okay?

1:05:07.708 --> 1:05:09.666
Because they made fun of me.

1:05:10.291 --> 1:05:13.958
Because I had a girl's name.

1:05:15.375 --> 1:05:18.500
And I am a boy!

1:05:19.333 --> 1:05:22.125
I am a boy, okay?

1:05:22.916 --> 1:05:25.833
And yoga is for girls.

1:05:26.666 --> 1:05:30.125
They called me Sunshine, okay?

1:05:30.791 --> 1:05:32.250
This is your fault.

1:05:32.958 --> 1:05:34.791
This is Baba's fault.

1:05:34.875 --> 1:05:37.083
Baba and I, we made mistakes,

1:05:37.166 --> 1:05:39.166
uh, we didn't understand…

1:05:39.958 --> 1:05:41.666
and we're sorry, I'm so sorry.

1:05:41.750 --> 1:05:43.458
Baba is so sorry.

1:05:43.541 --> 1:05:45.500
-Huh?

1:05:45.583 --> 1:05:48.041
It's not your fault, Dada.

1:05:51.541 --> 1:05:52.708
<i>Who's gonna pay for that moorti?</i>

1:05:54.500 --> 1:05:55.541
Where is your pay
for moorti, huh? Huh?

1:05:57.083 --> 1:05:58.750
-Huh?

1:05:58.833 --> 1:06:00.291
-You pay for it!

1:06:00.375 --> 1:06:03.291
-Will you buy another moorti, huh?

1:06:03.375 --> 1:06:05.458
Bloody useless! Useless!

1:06:06.250 --> 1:06:07.500
Enough, Baba!

1:06:08.041 --> 1:06:09.666
<i>Bewusstseinslage.</i>

1:06:09.750 --> 1:06:14.958
<i>A state of consciousness or a feeling</i>
<i>devoid of sensory components.</i>

1:06:15.041 --> 1:06:16.750
<i>Bewusstseinslage.</i>

1:06:18.291 --> 1:06:20.583
-Fuck!

1:06:20.666 --> 1:06:22.458
No, no!

1:06:26.541 --> 1:06:29.166
I love you so much. I love you.

1:06:29.250 --> 1:06:34.083
They called me Sunny Sunshine.
This is your fault!

1:06:34.166 --> 1:06:37.208
-Mom! What did you do?

1:06:37.875 --> 1:06:39.875
Mom, Mom! Mom!

1:06:39.958 --> 1:06:44.250
Ma! Ma, come on, wake up!

1:06:44.333 --> 1:06:47.625
Word, word, word.

1:06:56.750 --> 1:06:58.208
<i>Callipygian.</i>

1:06:58.291 --> 1:07:03.041
<i>C-A-L-L-I-P-Y-G-I-A-N.</i>

1:07:03.125 --> 1:07:04.291
<i>Callipygian.</i>

1:07:04.375 --> 1:07:06.541
<i>Having well-shaped buttocks.</i>

1:07:11.208 --> 1:07:12.458
Monica, Sonny?

1:07:13.291 --> 1:07:14.583
I'm Dr. Chiou.

1:07:14.666 --> 1:07:16.125
-Is she okay?
-Yes.

1:07:16.208 --> 1:07:18.208
Your mother has a mild concussion.

1:07:18.291 --> 1:07:19.291
We wrapped her head.

1:07:19.375 --> 1:07:20.416
Give her plenty of rest,

1:07:20.500 --> 1:07:22.458
and she'll be fully recovered
in a couple days.

1:07:22.541 --> 1:07:23.875
-She can go home today.

1:07:23.958 --> 1:07:25.041
Thank God.

1:07:26.375 --> 1:07:28.250
What about her hypothyroidism?

1:07:29.416 --> 1:07:30.708
Hypothyroidism?

1:07:30.791 --> 1:07:33.708
Her fibromyalgia
developed into hypothyroidism

1:07:33.791 --> 1:07:34.958
almost a month ago.

1:07:37.375 --> 1:07:39.291
Your mother has a clean bill of health.

1:07:40.375 --> 1:07:43.791
Her medical history shows no record
of either of those diseases

1:07:43.875 --> 1:07:46.208
or any disease for that matter.

1:07:52.291 --> 1:07:55.541
Sonny, your mother called
your previous therapist, Dr. Goodwin?

1:07:56.166 --> 1:07:59.333
I spoke to him myself.
He'd love to see you again.

1:08:16.708 --> 1:08:18.791
Hey, Boony, are you--
Are you up there?

1:08:19.958 --> 1:08:20.875
Can I come up?

1:08:21.708 --> 1:08:24.083
-Okay.

1:08:26.041 --> 1:08:27.791
So the other day,

1:08:27.875 --> 1:08:30.041
I went to the Westmoreland Mall
and I saw Larry Hawkins.

1:08:30.125 --> 1:08:32.750
He still works at Sbarro's.
I mean, I can't believe it.

1:08:32.833 --> 1:08:35.458
I'd be so sick of pizza
if I worked there since high school.

1:08:35.541 --> 1:08:37.083
You need professional help, Dada.

1:08:38.541 --> 1:08:39.666
This isn't a joke.

1:08:43.875 --> 1:08:48.750
Look, uh, Boony, I'm really sorry
about what happened to Ma, but I--

1:08:48.833 --> 1:08:50.791
You know,
everything's okay, right?

1:08:50.875 --> 1:08:52.500
And I'm fine.

1:08:52.583 --> 1:08:53.541
No, you're not.

1:08:55.583 --> 1:08:56.750
I'm not crazy.

1:08:59.333 --> 1:09:02.916
I can't be in your life
if you're not on any medication.

1:09:03.875 --> 1:09:05.541
-I'll--
-I just can't. I can't.

1:09:07.458 --> 1:09:08.333
I'm fine.

1:09:11.416 --> 1:09:12.916
You have to go.

1:09:14.041 --> 1:09:16.250
Go make, like, Emerald level status

1:09:16.333 --> 1:09:18.500
or whatever the fuck it is
you do with your life, okay?

1:09:18.583 --> 1:09:21.083
Just, like, don't come back.
Leave us alone.

1:10:27.583 --> 1:10:29.333
-Okay, ready? Good.
-Yeah.

1:10:29.416 --> 1:10:31.458
-Yeah, yeah.

1:10:32.083 --> 1:10:34.916
"Swish Swish Max"? Can you handle it?

1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:36.833
-You know I can.

1:10:36.916 --> 1:10:39.041
-I don't know if I can.
-Thanks.

1:10:39.625 --> 1:10:42.833
-For what?
-For being the best bestie.

1:10:42.916 --> 1:10:46.416
Mon, you never told anyone
when I peed in my pants on 1-19,

1:10:46.500 --> 1:10:48.291
-walking home from Park N Pool…

1:10:48.375 --> 1:10:49.875
…in fourth grade.

1:10:49.958 --> 1:10:51.625
I told Oreo.

1:10:51.708 --> 1:10:55.416
And I forgive you for tattling on me
to my cocker spaniel.

1:10:55.500 --> 1:10:58.250
-May he rest in peace.
-Oh, RIP Oreo.

1:10:58.333 --> 1:11:01.250
-But you know I got your back.
-I know.

1:11:01.333 --> 1:11:02.250
-Always.
-Always.

1:11:03.666 --> 1:11:05.833
Stop trying to distract me.

1:11:05.916 --> 1:11:07.625
-Come on. Okay.

1:11:14.333 --> 1:11:16.208
Huh? What? Hi, how…

1:11:16.291 --> 1:11:18.458
-How did you get in here?

1:11:18.541 --> 1:11:20.125
The door was open.

1:11:20.208 --> 1:11:22.875
These jagoffs stopped in at Jay's,
and they were asking about you.

1:11:22.958 --> 1:11:25.541
Well, I was asking about you.

1:11:25.625 --> 1:11:28.666
Yes.

1:11:32.041 --> 1:11:33.416
I got you.

1:11:54.916 --> 1:11:55.875
Ah.

1:11:57.291 --> 1:11:59.166
-I, um…

1:11:59.833 --> 1:12:01.541
I go back to Detroit on Sunday.

1:12:02.125 --> 1:12:03.958
-Cool.
-Yeah.

1:12:04.041 --> 1:12:05.750
Back to the grind, Richie!

1:12:05.833 --> 1:12:08.541
-Sorry.

1:12:08.625 --> 1:12:09.916
Okay.

1:12:10.958 --> 1:12:13.000
Um, you know what, you should…

1:12:14.291 --> 1:12:15.208
You should come visit.

1:12:15.291 --> 1:12:18.375
It's only a two and a half hour drive
from Cleveland.

1:12:19.958 --> 1:12:21.666
Oh. Oh, Krista told me you were moving.

1:12:21.750 --> 1:12:23.333
Congrats on the job, by the way.

1:12:23.416 --> 1:12:27.333
Yeah, I'm, you know, still kind
of on the fence about it.

1:12:28.125 --> 1:12:30.000
I have a shit-ton of stuff
going on around here,

1:12:30.083 --> 1:12:32.458
and wouldn't wanna cancel my students.

1:12:32.541 --> 1:12:35.166
Well, the ones I have left anyway.

1:12:39.958 --> 1:12:40.791
Okay.

1:12:58.625 --> 1:13:00.125
O-Oh, shit, shit.

1:13:00.208 --> 1:13:01.708
-Uh, good morning, sir!
-Shut up.

1:13:01.791 --> 1:13:02.750
Yes, sir.

1:13:03.916 --> 1:13:05.541
-You should probably…
-Uh, nah, I should--

1:13:05.625 --> 1:13:07.541
-Yeah, I should, um…
-That's a great idea.

1:13:07.625 --> 1:13:09.125
Thank you so much.

1:13:09.708 --> 1:13:11.666
Grab this right here, and, uh…

1:13:11.750 --> 1:13:13.666
Mm. Okay, bye.

1:13:47.833 --> 1:13:49.500
I'll never forgive you for this.

1:14:40.833 --> 1:14:42.750
-You're not supposed to be here.

1:14:43.250 --> 1:14:44.375
I hate her.

1:14:45.208 --> 1:14:46.041
I know.

1:14:51.708 --> 1:14:52.708
Got you something.

1:15:05.041 --> 1:15:06.041
Thank you.

1:15:10.416 --> 1:15:15.083
How come you're so nice to me
but not nice to Dada?

1:15:22.583 --> 1:15:25.000
-Dada, are you in there?

1:15:25.916 --> 1:15:29.208
Cracked open a couple Thums Up,
and set up carrom dash.

1:15:29.291 --> 1:15:32.500
-For a rematch before we go out to eat.

1:15:32.583 --> 1:15:34.500
I still maintain
that I didn't cheat,

1:15:34.583 --> 1:15:37.458
but if the only way to prove it to you
is a rematch, I'm game.

1:15:39.791 --> 1:15:44.541
Um, you know, it's cool.
We can always play later.

1:15:45.166 --> 1:15:46.291
Totally cool.

1:16:05.250 --> 1:16:08.125
<i>…and also because I thought</i>
<i>to myself, you know,</i>

1:16:08.208 --> 1:16:10.500
this is a good opportunity
to have a vacation.

1:16:10.583 --> 1:16:13.333
So then I called Dr. Ali,

1:16:14.208 --> 1:16:15.875
and she agreed to help me.

1:16:18.625 --> 1:16:23.166
Ma, what you did,
faking being on your death bed,

1:16:23.250 --> 1:16:25.833
is literally like one
of those Bengali soap operas

1:16:25.916 --> 1:16:27.291
you're so obsessed with.

1:16:27.375 --> 1:16:29.625
Where do you think I got the idea from?

1:16:31.500 --> 1:16:33.125
It's reassuring to know
which side of the family

1:16:33.208 --> 1:16:35.375
we inherited the bizarre from.

1:16:35.958 --> 1:16:39.208
Mm, we need to make sure
you take the bread home

1:16:39.291 --> 1:16:40.875
in a doggy bag, huh?

1:16:40.958 --> 1:16:43.750
Why would you order another basket
if you weren't gonna eat it?

1:16:44.583 --> 1:16:45.708
I am going to eat it.

1:16:46.666 --> 1:16:48.166
Tomorrow morning for breakfast.

1:16:51.041 --> 1:16:53.166
Dada, Dada, let's…

1:16:53.750 --> 1:16:57.625
Let's tell them
it's your birthday.

1:17:01.625 --> 1:17:02.458
Boony…

1:17:08.666 --> 1:17:09.750
I have a headache.

1:17:12.208 --> 1:17:14.916
You know what,
we'll take the rest of this to-go,

1:17:15.833 --> 1:17:17.208
then we'll go home, no?

1:17:18.125 --> 1:17:19.166
Mm.

1:17:19.250 --> 1:17:22.833
But you love telling them
it's your birthday.

1:17:22.916 --> 1:17:25.000
They come over,
and they sing that stupid song,

1:17:25.083 --> 1:17:27.041
and they have the cake
with the one candle in it,

1:17:27.125 --> 1:17:30.250
and you hate cake,
so you give me the cake, and then…

1:17:35.333 --> 1:17:36.416
<i>Prosopopoeia.</i>

1:17:36.500 --> 1:17:41.000
<i>P-R-O-S-O-P-O-P-O-E-I-A.</i>

1:17:41.083 --> 1:17:42.666
<i>Prosopopoeia.</i>

1:17:42.750 --> 1:17:46.541
<i>A figure of speech in which an imagined</i>
<i>or absent person or thing</i>

1:17:46.625 --> 1:17:48.458
<i>is represented as speaking.</i>

1:17:53.250 --> 1:17:54.208
My head hurts.

1:17:56.375 --> 1:17:57.208
Pretty bad.

1:17:59.541 --> 1:18:00.375
Really bad.

1:18:07.416 --> 1:18:08.583
Dada's tired.

1:18:14.166 --> 1:18:17.166
-So when's your going away party?
-What do you mean?

1:18:17.250 --> 1:18:20.958
You can take the job now.
There's no Jaya to look after.

1:18:23.166 --> 1:18:26.041
-Dada's on his meds.
-That's good, right?

1:18:27.625 --> 1:18:29.750
He's there, but he's not, like, there.

1:18:30.541 --> 1:18:35.416
The lamictal-lithium combo
just kills his personality.

1:18:35.500 --> 1:18:37.541
I get it now. I get why he hates the meds.

1:18:37.625 --> 1:18:39.625
Mon, it's okay.

1:18:39.708 --> 1:18:41.583
He sleeps all the time.

1:18:41.666 --> 1:18:44.291
Even when he's awake,
it's like he's asleep.

1:18:44.375 --> 1:18:47.083
I Googled
into bipolar black hole last night,

1:18:48.166 --> 1:18:52.625
and I saw the definition with him.

1:18:53.291 --> 1:18:54.500
Around your brother?

1:18:55.500 --> 1:18:57.041
He's not a stranger.

1:18:57.833 --> 1:18:58.791
Exactly.

1:19:00.500 --> 1:19:04.541
It was normal,
but then it just got all blurry.

1:19:04.625 --> 1:19:05.708
It's never blurry.

1:19:06.458 --> 1:19:10.291
Okay, first of all,
you have to get the fuck off Google.

1:19:10.875 --> 1:19:15.708
And second of all, at rehab,
we addicts were fed all kinds of pills.

1:19:15.791 --> 1:19:17.250
I went through, like, six different pills

1:19:17.333 --> 1:19:22.583
before one didn't make me
absolutely insane or fat or nauseous.

1:19:23.083 --> 1:19:24.166
But he hates me.

1:19:24.250 --> 1:19:27.500
No, his body is just figuring things out
right now.

1:19:28.458 --> 1:19:31.541
If you're worried, get involved.
Call his doctor.

1:19:32.041 --> 1:19:34.083
Maybe there's another pill he can take.

1:19:34.666 --> 1:19:35.500
Maybe.

1:19:36.416 --> 1:19:39.291
Yeah, if he even wants me involved.

1:19:39.375 --> 1:19:42.750
Do not let Sonny's thing
be another excuse.

1:19:43.291 --> 1:19:45.125
You can't just take care of people
your whole life

1:19:45.208 --> 1:19:46.791
without taking care of yourself.

1:19:50.375 --> 1:19:54.333
-Cleveland sucks though.
-Well, so do the Browns.

1:19:54.916 --> 1:19:56.583
But the job doesn't.

1:19:56.666 --> 1:19:59.916
I mean, think of all those shiny beakers
and petri dishes

1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:01.875
and microscopes you'll get to play with.

1:20:02.916 --> 1:20:03.750
Yeah.

1:20:05.083 --> 1:20:06.833
Oh, hold on.

1:20:14.416 --> 1:20:16.791
-I know it's not V-Day…

1:20:16.875 --> 1:20:20.208
…but I thought you could use
some old-school Wombat love tonight.

1:20:21.083 --> 1:20:24.291
-I do not deserve you.
-Yes, you do.

1:20:24.375 --> 1:20:25.416
I know.

1:20:26.041 --> 1:20:28.750
I didn't mean that,
it just felt like something I should say.

1:20:33.583 --> 1:20:36.916
Wombat rules for life!

1:20:39.291 --> 1:20:43.333
Oh, I know. You're allergic to flowers.

1:20:43.416 --> 1:20:46.791
Payal, if you spell
this next word correctly,

1:20:46.875 --> 1:20:52.375
we will declare you the 2020
Harold Junior High Spelling Bee champion.

1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:55.791
Morosoph.

1:20:55.875 --> 1:20:57.750
Definition, please.

1:20:57.833 --> 1:21:01.541
Morosoph is a philosophical
or learned fool.

1:21:02.333 --> 1:21:06.583
-Language of origin?
-Obsolete French and Greek.

1:21:07.250 --> 1:21:10.333
Are there any alternate pronunciations?

1:21:10.875 --> 1:21:13.583
-Just the one.
-Part of speech?

1:21:13.666 --> 1:21:14.500
Noun.

1:21:15.458 --> 1:21:17.583
Can you please repeat the word?

1:21:18.958 --> 1:21:20.333
Morosoph.

1:21:21.416 --> 1:21:22.541
Morosoph.

1:21:23.541 --> 1:21:26.333
M-O-R…

1:21:37.291 --> 1:21:39.125
I don't give a fuck.

1:21:39.208 --> 1:21:41.166
-Morosoph.

1:21:41.250 --> 1:21:43.625
That is absolutely not correct!

1:21:43.708 --> 1:21:45.833
Payal, goodness gracious, take your seat.

1:21:46.666 --> 1:21:52.291
Derek, you are the 2020
Harold Junior High Spelling Bee champion,

1:21:52.375 --> 1:21:55.875
which means you're gonna be going
to the regionals next month in Harrisburg.

1:23:10.291 --> 1:23:12.791
So, that's all the time
we have today.

1:23:14.166 --> 1:23:15.875
Sonny didn't even say anything.

1:23:18.958 --> 1:23:20.750
I don't have anything to say to you.

1:23:30.750 --> 1:23:31.791
Why did you come?

1:23:33.791 --> 1:23:34.791
Because you wanted me to.

1:23:35.916 --> 1:23:37.166
That was last time.

1:23:38.333 --> 1:23:39.166
I know.

1:23:40.125 --> 1:23:41.583
I'm sorry. I was scared.

1:23:46.166 --> 1:23:47.666
Not to blame you for anything,

1:23:49.166 --> 1:23:53.375
but that's when I convinced myself
that I wasn't bipolar, that I was cured.

1:23:56.916 --> 1:23:58.333
I was afraid you were gonna love me less

1:23:58.416 --> 1:24:00.708
because you thought I was
<i>One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.</i>

1:24:00.791 --> 1:24:03.208
I fucking love you so much.

1:24:04.416 --> 1:24:06.541
I hated not talking to you.

1:24:07.458 --> 1:24:08.791
You're my big Dada.

1:24:09.791 --> 1:24:13.625
Then this thing,
this invisible disease just took over,

1:24:13.708 --> 1:24:18.250
and I felt like the old you died
and some stranger just took your place.

1:24:18.333 --> 1:24:20.708
It's still me. It's still your big Dada.

1:24:23.041 --> 1:24:24.041
I was just ashamed

1:24:24.125 --> 1:24:26.666
because I didn't understand
what was happening to me.

1:24:26.750 --> 1:24:28.500
And after everything with Baba, I…

1:24:29.333 --> 1:24:31.416
I just didn't want to hurt anyone else,
so I just stayed away.

1:24:31.500 --> 1:24:33.625
I thought that was the best thing
for everybody.

1:24:33.708 --> 1:24:34.708
I missed you.

1:24:35.250 --> 1:24:36.166
I missed you too.

1:24:38.208 --> 1:24:39.416
I know I let you down.

1:24:40.583 --> 1:24:41.541
My little Boony…

1:24:43.333 --> 1:24:45.541
I just thought if I ignored it

1:24:46.500 --> 1:24:50.166
and pretended like nothing was wrong,
it would all just magically go away.

1:24:50.875 --> 1:24:51.750
Me too.

1:25:03.500 --> 1:25:08.208
And now, Boony, you take
the <i>sindoor</i>, and <i>phota</i> it on Dada.

1:25:10.666 --> 1:25:12.333
Dada has to <i>phota</i> me first.

1:25:12.416 --> 1:25:14.041
That is not <i>bhai</i> <i>phota</i>.

1:25:14.125 --> 1:25:15.625
This is so sexist.

1:25:15.708 --> 1:25:18.833
How come Indians celebrate a Brothers Day,
but not a Sisters Day?

1:25:19.375 --> 1:25:21.416
-Ugh. Forget it.

1:25:21.500 --> 1:25:23.708
Hey, hey, hey, just-- Just sit down.

1:25:23.791 --> 1:25:26.625
Sit down, sit down. I'll do it, okay?
I'll <i>phota</i> you first.

1:25:26.708 --> 1:25:28.708
It can be Brother and Sister Day.

1:25:28.791 --> 1:25:33.750
-Oh, Hindu gods are so chill.
-Very chill.

1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:41.250
Ma, I just feel like you're just pulling
those chants out of your ass.

1:25:41.333 --> 1:25:45.125
Don't say that A. I hate that A.

1:25:45.208 --> 1:25:47.833
Did you know the definition
of a male donkey is…

1:25:49.208 --> 1:25:51.000
Ass!

1:25:51.083 --> 1:25:54.791
-Do the <i>phota</i>!

1:25:56.833 --> 1:25:58.500
Mine looks better though, right?

1:25:59.416 --> 1:26:01.125
-You could tell us. Tell us the truth.
-Y-- No!

1:26:01.208 --> 1:26:02.916
We're old. We're old enough.
We can handle it.

1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:04.125
Who-- Which one's better?

1:26:05.500 --> 1:26:08.458
-I don't choose between my children.
-Ha, bullsh--

1:26:53.708 --> 1:26:55.166
I'll see you in Cleveland.
