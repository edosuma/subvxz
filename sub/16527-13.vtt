No, still at work.

00:31.664 --> 00:33.935
It's these
high‐frequency traders.

00:33.935 --> 00:35.672
I got to clean up their mess.

00:35.672 --> 00:37.742
No, you can go ahead
and eat without me.

00:37.742 --> 00:41.550
I, uh... I'll find
something here.

00:41.550 --> 00:42.719

01:43.473 --> 01:44.910
I was just
on my way out.

01:44.910 --> 01:46.880
I'm Feather.
Feather?

01:46.880 --> 01:49.686
If Riana had a friend named
Feather, I would've remembered.

01:49.686 --> 01:50.621
Who's Riana?

01:50.621 --> 01:52.592
"Who's Riana?" Okay,
that takes me back

01:52.592 --> 01:54.830
to my first question:
Who are you?

01:54.830 --> 01:57.502
ROGER JR.:
Feather, you forgot your belt.

01:58.504 --> 02:00.775
D‐Dad... y‐you're up.

02:00.775 --> 02:03.246
Yeah, I'm up. I was
just getting to know

02:03.246 --> 02:05.852
your friend, Feather.
Sorry. I'm such

02:05.852 --> 02:07.722
a space case.

02:07.722 --> 02:08.657
W‐We were just...

02:08.657 --> 02:11.395
upstairs.
Yeah, making decorative belts.

02:11.395 --> 02:12.498
Studying.
Otherwise,
how would someone

02:12.498 --> 02:15.370
just lose their belt, like,
poof, "My belt is gone"?

02:15.370 --> 02:17.809
You're hilarious,
Mr. Murtaugh.

02:17.809 --> 02:19.411
It's Detective Murtaugh.

02:19.411 --> 02:20.748
Not that hilarious.

02:20.748 --> 02:23.888
Can I just say,
we're all adults here.

02:23.888 --> 02:25.056
Oh, are we?

02:25.056 --> 02:27.762
You raised a
great young man.

02:27.762 --> 02:29.365
You should be proud.

02:29.365 --> 02:31.269
Bye, babe.

02:33.072 --> 02:36.513
(door opens, closes)
Dad, uh, let me explain.

02:36.513 --> 02:38.617
We‐we had...
I know what you had.

02:38.617 --> 02:40.888
You had the audacity
to bring a girl in my house

02:40.888 --> 02:43.026
while your mother and I
are up there sleeping?

02:43.026 --> 02:44.061
And you think
we wouldn't find out?

02:44.061 --> 02:46.065
It's not a big deal.
It's not a big deal?

02:46.065 --> 02:47.467
Well, guess what?

02:47.467 --> 02:48.469
I'm grounded forever.

02:48.469 --> 02:49.806
Maybe longer.

02:49.806 --> 02:52.377
We'll talk about this tomorrow.
Get upstairs.

02:57.822 --> 03:00.360
(chuckles)

03:00.360 --> 03:02.497
(seagulls cawing)

03:04.603 --> 03:06.540
(snoring)

03:17.662 --> 03:18.797
WOMAN:
Mm.

03:18.797 --> 03:21.369
Mm, morning.

03:22.070 --> 03:23.974
Yep.

03:23.974 --> 03:26.479
That's what it is.
(groans)

03:26.479 --> 03:28.550
You got somewhere to be?

03:28.550 --> 03:30.688
Uh, yeah. I got
this thing

03:30.688 --> 03:33.761
that I, uh,
just completely forgot about.

03:33.761 --> 03:34.729
Um...

03:34.729 --> 03:38.704
yeah, look, there's some OJ
in the fri‐‐

03:38.704 --> 03:41.843
no, do not drink the OJ
that is in that refrigerator.

03:41.843 --> 03:43.747
Um...

03:49.960 --> 03:51.530
(Murtaugh laughs)

03:51.530 --> 03:53.901
My boy got some
action last night.

03:55.938 --> 03:57.875
What? Who did?

03:57.875 --> 03:58.610
RJ.

03:58.610 --> 04:00.715
Not only is he
Princeton‐bound,

04:00.715 --> 04:02.952
but it turns out,
he's inherited

04:02.952 --> 04:04.956
his dad's charms
with the ladies.

04:04.956 --> 04:06.660
That's good news.
(chuckles)

04:06.660 --> 04:08.129
Yeah, that's
what‐‐ hey.

04:08.129 --> 04:09.866
What in the...?

04:11.435 --> 04:12.605
Is that a bathing
suit you got on?

04:12.605 --> 04:14.408
Uh, all my pants
were stained up

04:14.408 --> 04:15.845
and I didn't want to
look unprofessional.

04:15.845 --> 04:17.515
Okay, you know what's
unprofessional?

04:17.515 --> 04:20.120
Is you blinding me
with those pasty legs.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.090
Exactly.
They need a little vitamin D.

04:22.090 --> 04:23.493
Riggs.

04:23.493 --> 04:25.765
You gonna tell me
that this right here

04:25.765 --> 04:27.735
is not even a
little weird,

04:27.735 --> 04:28.704
even for you?

04:28.704 --> 04:31.042
Uh, this line of questioning
is a little weird.

04:31.042 --> 04:33.680
And uncomfortable.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.152
(sighing): Okay, it's
gonna be that kind of day.

04:36.152 --> 04:39.491
(indistinct radio transmission)

04:39.491 --> 04:40.928
Okay, so who is he?

04:40.928 --> 04:42.765
Dale Reynolds, 35.

04:42.765 --> 04:46.038
Had quite a party followed
by an accidental overdose.

04:46.038 --> 04:48.142
Or not so accidental.

04:48.142 --> 04:49.512
The bluish skin,

04:49.512 --> 04:50.748
bleeding foam
around his mouth,

04:50.748 --> 04:52.184
all point to an OD, but...

04:52.184 --> 04:53.654
check out the knot
in the tourniquet.

04:53.654 --> 04:55.190
BAILEY: It's on the outside
of his arm.

04:55.190 --> 04:58.162
Which means he had help.

04:58.162 --> 04:59.766
What you got there, legs?

04:59.766 --> 05:01.636
A wedding ring
stuffed in his pocket.

05:06.145 --> 05:08.617
Dale Reynolds, you
cheating bastard.

05:08.617 --> 05:10.654
MURTAUGH:
Okay, well,

05:10.654 --> 05:13.627
someone had to be the last
person to see him alive.

05:13.627 --> 05:18.504
So, let's find that girlfriend,
boyfriend, intern, escort...

05:18.504 --> 05:20.574
(woman laughing)

05:20.574 --> 05:22.377
(echoing):
Nice place you got here.

05:35.704 --> 05:38.510
MURTAUGH: And make sure
that you call his, um...

05:38.510 --> 05:39.512
BAILEY: His wife?
MURTAUGH: Yeah.

05:39.512 --> 05:40.748
BAILEY: Yeah, tell her
we found her husband dead

05:40.748 --> 05:44.054
in a hotel room, smelling like
another woman's cheap perfume.

05:44.054 --> 05:45.958
I'm on it.

05:45.958 --> 05:47.828
Is that what that
smell is? (sniffs)

05:47.828 --> 05:50.968
Doesn't seem to be
coming off the corpse.

05:50.968 --> 05:53.105
I think...

05:53.105 --> 05:55.076
it's coming from...

05:55.076 --> 05:57.715
Riggs?

06:17.788 --> 06:19.993
(water running)

06:19.993 --> 06:21.997
(indistinct radio transmission)

06:21.997 --> 06:24.535
Sinner.

06:26.105 --> 06:27.207
Me?

06:27.207 --> 06:29.712
No, him.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.870
AVERY:
<i>Bailey, what do you got?</i>

06:41.870 --> 06:43.807
There's security footage
of a van arriving

06:43.807 --> 06:46.145
and leaving the hotel garage
that times out with our killer.

06:46.145 --> 06:47.314
Okay, do you
have a plate?

06:47.314 --> 06:49.051
A partial
and we're looking into it.

06:49.051 --> 06:50.688
Good enough news.

06:55.631 --> 06:58.135
Mr. City Attorney,
in the house.

06:58.135 --> 06:59.605
What a rare, unexpected treat.

06:59.605 --> 07:00.741
Did I‐‐
did I know you were...?

07:00.741 --> 07:01.676
I just thought
I'd pop in.

07:01.676 --> 07:03.947
Awesome. You heard
we caught a grizzly one.

07:03.947 --> 07:05.116
You're hear to scrub in?

07:05.116 --> 07:07.153
We need to talk.

07:07.153 --> 07:08.690
I have concerns.

07:09.625 --> 07:10.961
Never a great opening.

07:12.030 --> 07:14.134
Martin Riggs...

07:14.134 --> 07:15.537
how's he doing?

07:15.537 --> 07:16.940
Riggs? He's...

07:16.940 --> 07:18.042
he's doing well.

07:19.211 --> 07:20.279
Adjusting to the culture.

07:20.279 --> 07:22.585
He‐he should be here any minute,

07:22.585 --> 07:24.154
you could ask him yourself.

07:24.154 --> 07:25.691
I intend to.

07:25.691 --> 07:27.895
But I want to hear
from you first.

07:27.895 --> 07:29.799
Make sure
there aren't any issues

07:29.799 --> 07:31.803
I should have heard about
already.

07:31.803 --> 07:34.675
None‐‐
none that I can think of...

07:34.675 --> 07:36.679
off the top of my head.

07:36.679 --> 07:38.650
(elevator bell dings)

07:38.650 --> 07:40.654
If you're sick,
you should go home.

07:40.654 --> 07:41.923
I'm not sick.
You threw up.

07:41.923 --> 07:43.827
Barely. It was more
about your cleanse.

07:43.827 --> 07:44.896
MURTAUGH:
Look, all I'm saying

07:44.896 --> 07:47.133
is that you're
not yourself,

07:47.133 --> 07:49.872
and when you are yourself,
you're barely function...

07:58.657 --> 07:59.926
AVERY:
Roger.

07:59.926 --> 08:01.763
You know Ronnie Delgado?
He had some concerns

08:01.763 --> 08:03.600
about your partner, Riggs.
I was hoping you could, uh...

08:03.600 --> 08:05.671
Why?
'Cause he wore shorts today?

08:05.671 --> 08:07.641
Shorts?
Roger,

08:07.641 --> 08:10.814
maybe you could
tell the city attorney how well

08:10.814 --> 08:12.685
your partner
is doing.
Is he drinking?

08:12.685 --> 08:14.755
Behaving erratically?

08:14.755 --> 08:16.124
(laughs)

08:16.124 --> 08:17.327
Riggs? Drinking?

08:17.327 --> 08:18.329
Um,

08:18.329 --> 08:19.699
um... (clears throat)

08:19.699 --> 08:21.335
I don't know
what he does

08:21.335 --> 08:22.838
after hours, but

08:22.838 --> 08:25.309
you're asking:
is he drinking during the day?

08:25.309 --> 08:26.278
Is‐is what
you're asking.

08:26.278 --> 08:28.717
Where is he?
Hmm.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.687
He's probably
doing paperwork.

08:30.687 --> 08:32.658
He loves paperwork.

08:32.658 --> 08:34.662
AVERY: He does
a lot of paperwork.

08:34.662 --> 08:35.764
I'm gonna see
if I can find him.

08:35.764 --> 08:36.833
Yes.
Good idea.

08:36.833 --> 08:38.102
Good idea.
I think you can.

08:50.994 --> 08:52.631
(sighs)

08:59.979 --> 09:00.948
(grunts)

09:02.952 --> 09:04.321
Riggs?

09:04.321 --> 09:05.356
Are we okay?

09:05.356 --> 09:07.093
Oh, hey, Doc.

09:07.093 --> 09:08.730
Yeah, just another day
in paradise.

09:08.730 --> 09:10.701
What are you doing
under a vending machine?

09:10.701 --> 09:13.707
Well, I needed a break
and this is a break room.

09:13.707 --> 09:15.376
And now, I'm trying to get...

09:15.376 --> 09:17.781
(straining):
this... little...

09:17.781 --> 09:18.683
(grunts)

09:18.683 --> 09:21.254
Got it.
(groans)

09:21.254 --> 09:22.223
(sighs)

09:22.223 --> 09:25.062
(chip bag rips open)

09:25.062 --> 09:26.365
So, is this it?

09:26.365 --> 09:28.335
Have we finally arrived
at rock‐bottom?

09:28.335 --> 09:30.641
No, there's still
some places to go.

09:31.341 --> 09:33.913
Oh, Duke.
How'd we do?

09:33.913 --> 09:34.949
Uh, I got most of
what you wanted.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.786
Except for your wallet,
I couldn't find it.

09:36.786 --> 09:39.024
No worries.
Thanks, buddy.

09:39.024 --> 09:39.892
Oh,

09:39.892 --> 09:40.827
okay, so you're
eating floor chips

09:40.827 --> 09:43.265
and you sent a uni to
retrieve your pants?

09:43.265 --> 09:44.769
Ah.

09:46.138 --> 09:47.473
A wool cap.

09:47.473 --> 09:50.046
It is getting chilly
outside. Duke!

09:50.046 --> 09:53.318
This is looking like a
pretty clear cry for help.

09:53.318 --> 09:55.456
(sighs)

09:55.456 --> 09:58.095
Well, as usual,

09:58.095 --> 09:59.330
you're not wrong.

09:59.330 --> 10:00.801
Would you like
to help me out?

10:00.801 --> 10:02.270
Yes. Yes, I would.

10:02.270 --> 10:05.209
Well, apparently,
I've misplaced my wallet.

10:05.209 --> 10:08.348
And I'm starving,
so if I could borrow a buck,

20:49.029 --> 20:50.799
You guys are being ridiculous.

20:51.901 --> 20:55.642
Okay, look,

20:55.642 --> 20:57.112
I get it.

20:57.112 --> 20:59.216
You're on this road and you meet
this exciting girl,

20:59.216 --> 21:00.886
and she says,
"Hey, you know what?

21:00.886 --> 21:02.422
"There's a whole world out there

21:02.422 --> 21:03.592
if you go off‐road."

21:03.592 --> 21:05.729
Maybe I don't like
the road I'm on.

21:05.729 --> 21:07.767
Maybe Princeton is your dream.

21:07.767 --> 21:08.802
I need to figure out

21:08.802 --> 21:10.471
w‐what's mine, what I want.

21:10.471 --> 21:12.576
Well, I want to get back to the
belt, that's what I want.

21:12.576 --> 21:14.847
(knocking on door)

21:14.847 --> 21:16.651
The thing is,

21:16.651 --> 21:18.889
you can get lost, okay?
Mm‐hmm.

21:18.889 --> 21:20.491
You can go off‐road

21:20.491 --> 21:22.663
and never make it back.
TRISH:
Yeah.

21:22.663 --> 21:24.634
People do.

21:24.634 --> 21:26.538
Howdy.

21:26.538 --> 21:27.873
Was this planned?

21:28.809 --> 21:30.579
What? Ooh.

21:30.579 --> 21:31.380
Dinner.

21:31.380 --> 21:33.117
It's not a
good time, Riggs.

21:33.117 --> 21:34.554
We're having
a family, uh...

21:34.554 --> 21:35.622
Crisis.
Yeah.

21:35.622 --> 21:38.027
Oh, I'm great
in a crisis.
Yes, Riggs, please,

21:38.027 --> 21:39.897
I can't talk to
these people anymore.

21:39.897 --> 21:41.233
Oh, come on,
they're all right.

21:41.233 --> 21:43.805
I mean, your dad can be
a little chatty.

21:43.805 --> 21:44.941
I did not come
empty‐handed.

21:44.941 --> 21:47.580
Martin, you didn't have to.

21:47.580 --> 21:52.055
Oh, forget it. So, uh...
what's the problem?

21:52.055 --> 21:55.529
Besides all that,
RJ wants to blow off college.

21:55.529 --> 21:57.666
I want to see the world
with my girlfriend,

21:57.666 --> 21:58.835
and we're gonna start
in New Zealand.

21:58.835 --> 22:01.073
Ooh, New Zealand.
Wellington,

22:01.073 --> 22:04.112
the capital...
(clicks tongue) beautiful.

22:04.112 --> 22:06.016
Go for it.
Thank you.

22:08.522 --> 22:10.792
Crisis averted.
All right, let's eat.

22:10.792 --> 22:12.863
I'm gonna grab a plate.

22:14.065 --> 22:16.069
RIGGS:
Anybody need anything?!

22:16.069 --> 22:17.840
(video game gunfire)

22:20.746 --> 22:22.850
Feather, huh?

22:22.850 --> 22:24.186
Somebody named her that?

22:24.186 --> 22:25.087
Yeah.

22:25.087 --> 22:27.993
That's a name, all right.

22:27.993 --> 22:30.666
He's out there
filling RJ's head

22:30.666 --> 22:34.840
with more foolishness,
if that's even possible.

22:34.840 --> 22:36.243
I'm gonna go put
an end to this.

22:36.243 --> 22:38.548
Roger, don't.

22:38.548 --> 22:39.249
Don't interfere.

22:39.249 --> 22:41.119
If we push,
RJ will push back.

22:41.119 --> 22:43.725
So what do we do, just
sit back while his life

22:43.725 --> 22:46.664
goes down the drain?
No, it's a phase.
RJ will turn around.

22:46.664 --> 22:47.600
I mean, when he finds out

22:47.600 --> 22:50.739
how much a ticket
to New Zealand costs.

22:50.739 --> 22:51.975
Hmm.

22:51.975 --> 22:53.612
You love her?

22:54.880 --> 22:57.151
I do.

22:57.151 --> 23:01.059
Never let her go.
You hear me?

23:01.059 --> 23:03.097
Yeah. We got plans to go...

23:03.097 --> 23:05.234
What did I just say?

23:05.234 --> 23:08.007
Y‐You said never let her go.

23:08.942 --> 23:11.046
Bingo.

23:12.850 --> 23:14.152
(Riggs sighs)

23:14.152 --> 23:15.121
Feather?

23:15.121 --> 23:18.962
She spell that with a "Ph"?

23:18.962 --> 23:21.768
What's going on with Riggs?

23:21.768 --> 23:22.870
The drinking?

23:22.870 --> 23:25.942
TRISH: That much drinking.
He's drowning in it.

23:25.942 --> 23:28.280
I've never seen it
this bad before.

23:28.280 --> 23:30.217
He should sleep
on the couch.

23:31.153 --> 23:33.892
Or in the garage.

23:33.892 --> 23:35.829
The couch.

23:35.829 --> 23:37.231
Or the driveway.

23:39.603 --> 23:42.910
(snoring lightly)

23:45.982 --> 23:47.619
Hey, you good?

23:47.619 --> 23:48.788
Mm‐hmm.

23:48.788 --> 23:51.259
I've got some pillows
and sheets and stuff for you.

23:51.259 --> 23:54.800
Oh, no need. I am
a simple man, buddy.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.740
No, the sheet is for
the couch, not you.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.610
Oh...
(clears throat)

23:59.610 --> 24:01.881
Yep, yep, yep, yep.
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

24:01.881 --> 24:04.119
You get your boots.
All right.

24:04.119 --> 24:06.924
I got this.
Oh. (clears throat)

24:12.703 --> 24:14.139
(grunts, groans)

24:14.139 --> 24:15.241
You all right?
Mm‐hmm.

24:18.180 --> 24:20.652
Look at this little...

24:20.652 --> 24:22.656
this little pouch
you've made.

24:25.629 --> 24:27.365
Okay.

24:27.365 --> 24:32.008
Hey, if you wake up
in a couple hours,

24:32.008 --> 24:34.045
and you think about
driving home,

24:34.045 --> 24:36.751
do me a favor, don't.

24:36.751 --> 24:38.153
Okay?

24:44.834 --> 24:47.205
I cheated on my wife.

24:51.714 --> 24:52.983
What?

24:55.387 --> 24:56.991
Last night.

24:59.128 --> 25:01.099
I drank too much,

25:01.099 --> 25:03.003
and, um...

25:03.003 --> 25:06.309
I didn't intentionally do it,
but I cheated on her.

25:09.950 --> 25:11.721
Want talk about it?

25:14.693 --> 25:16.129
We just did.

25:16.129 --> 25:17.966
You want to hit those lights
for me?

25:17.966 --> 25:19.269
(clears throat)

25:36.804 --> 25:38.841
WOMAN: <i>For someone who was</i>
<i>buried alive, she's doing okay.</i>

25:38.841 --> 25:40.411
Vitals are stable,
but she could be out

25:40.411 --> 25:41.246
for another couple
of days.

25:41.246 --> 25:43.885
I'll call you
if anything changes.

25:43.885 --> 25:46.924
Thank you.

25:46.924 --> 25:49.964
Same van, same message
left at the scene‐‐

25:49.964 --> 25:52.401
"sinner."
So it wasn't Garvey.

25:52.401 --> 25:54.940
We got one less suspect
and one more victim.

25:54.940 --> 25:55.976
What do we know
about her?

25:55.976 --> 25:59.215
Valerie Rausch, 48.
Never married, pays taxes,

25:59.215 --> 26:01.386
and works as a social
coordinator at a senior home.

26:01.386 --> 26:03.858
That's a job?

26:03.858 --> 26:06.964
Okay, Dale Reynolds
let his girlfriend die

26:06.964 --> 26:08.200
of a heroin overdose.

26:08.200 --> 26:11.841
And then someone shot him
full of heroin.

26:11.841 --> 26:13.143
The question is...

26:13.143 --> 26:14.913
Why does a never‐married
social coordinator

26:14.913 --> 26:16.316
get buried alive?

26:16.316 --> 26:18.921
Mm‐hmm.

26:22.461 --> 26:24.767
WOMAN: <i>It's like something</i>
<i>out of a nightmare.</i>

26:24.767 --> 26:27.304
Poor Valerie. Who would do
something like that?

26:27.304 --> 26:29.442
We were hoping you could point
us in the right direction.

26:29.442 --> 26:31.446
I wish.

26:31.446 --> 26:33.016
Mr. Raines.
Hmm?

26:33.016 --> 26:35.320
We talked about this.

26:35.320 --> 26:37.391
Shut it down.

26:39.429 --> 26:41.066
(computer beeps)

26:41.066 --> 26:43.771
Valerie's adored
by the residents.

26:43.771 --> 26:45.040
Me, not so much.

26:45.040 --> 26:47.244
Does she have an
office or a desk

26:47.244 --> 26:48.080
or something we
can look at?

26:48.080 --> 26:50.952
A locker.
I'll open it for you.

26:52.989 --> 26:54.258
Are you a Mexican?

26:54.258 --> 26:57.064
My last husband
was a Mexican.

26:57.064 --> 26:59.937
Beautiful man.
He sounds great, but...

26:59.937 --> 27:03.043
Don't believe
what anyone says.

27:04.011 --> 27:05.447
You know Valerie.

27:05.447 --> 27:06.884
She's an angel of death.

27:06.884 --> 27:09.757
O‐Okay...

27:09.757 --> 27:11.761
And she killed
Ethel Puckelwitz

27:11.761 --> 27:13.230
for her life insurance.

27:13.230 --> 27:17.973
Smothered her with a pillow
till she couldn't breathe.

27:17.973 --> 27:19.877
Mm‐mm.

27:21.446 --> 27:23.885
You all right?

27:23.885 --> 27:26.222
V‐Valerie was suffocated, right?
Yeah.

27:26.222 --> 27:28.528
I think I know
who we might be looking for.

27:28.528 --> 27:31.032
Good, because I think
I know where to look.

27:31.032 --> 27:32.536
I found this
in Valerie's locker.

27:32.536 --> 27:34.005
Church bulletin.

27:34.005 --> 27:36.977
Guess which church.

27:36.977 --> 27:38.881
PATTERSON: Valerie Rausch?

27:38.881 --> 27:40.552
Yeah, I know her.

27:40.552 --> 27:42.522
Well, she was buried alive
last night.

27:42.522 --> 27:44.458
Do you have any idea why?

27:44.458 --> 27:45.494
We're thinking it might
have something to do

27:45.494 --> 27:48.333
with her nasty habit
of smothering senior citizens

27:48.333 --> 27:51.306
to get their
life insurance.

27:51.306 --> 27:53.443
He doesn't look
surprised.

27:53.443 --> 27:54.947
He doesn't look surprised.
If I told you
something like that,

27:54.947 --> 27:56.182
I'd be surprise...
Would you not be...

27:56.182 --> 27:57.484
Would you please?
I would go, huh? What?

27:57.484 --> 27:59.857
Whoa, that's a surprised look.
That's what I was going for.

27:59.857 --> 28:01.994
Let me guess, Father,

28:01.994 --> 28:04.198
Valerie walked into
your little magic box

28:04.198 --> 28:06.002
and told you all about
her unconventional use

28:06.002 --> 28:07.939
of orthopedic pillows,
and...

28:07.939 --> 28:09.308
If such a thing happened,

28:09.308 --> 28:11.346
I would have urged her
to turn herself in.

28:11.346 --> 28:14.352
But she didn't, and someone
punished her for it.

28:14.352 --> 28:15.855
Just like
with Dale Reynolds.

28:15.855 --> 28:18.059
What do you want from me?

28:18.059 --> 28:19.395
A confession would be nice.

28:19.395 --> 28:22.001
You know I was
in the sanctuary.

28:22.001 --> 28:23.370
Then tell us
who it could be.

28:23.370 --> 28:25.107
Who else knows
what Valerie Rausch

28:25.107 --> 28:26.577
and Ben Garvey
confessed to you?

28:26.577 --> 28:29.015
No one. It was between
the confessor and God.

28:29.015 --> 28:30.484
(groans)

28:30.484 --> 28:33.023
It is so difficult
to subpoena God.
Mm‐hmm.

28:33.023 --> 28:35.595
All right, let's go turn
the confessional upside down.

28:35.595 --> 28:38.066
Ooh, that's the surprised
look I was hoping for.

28:38.066 --> 28:39.368
See that?

28:45.915 --> 28:47.585
What are we looking for,
anyway?

28:47.585 --> 28:49.523
Hell if I know.

28:49.523 --> 28:51.794
Kinda underwhelming,
isn't it?

28:53.496 --> 28:58.541
Hey, uh, I took your keys last
night when you weren't looking.

29:04.586 --> 29:07.291
I took a bottle of Blue Label
this morning from the den.

29:07.291 --> 29:09.395
Yeah, well, I knew
you were gonna do that,

29:09.395 --> 29:12.001
so I switched it
with a crappier bottle.

29:14.573 --> 29:16.175
The girl from the other night...

29:18.213 --> 29:19.448
...I don't even know her name.

29:19.448 --> 29:21.419
I don't really
remember anything.

29:21.419 --> 29:25.327
I was... I was
black‐out drunk.

29:25.327 --> 29:29.603
Well, that's got to be
unsettling.

29:29.603 --> 29:31.139
Is this happening a lot?

29:31.139 --> 29:32.609
Waking up with unknown girls?

29:32.609 --> 29:35.180
Getting blacked‐out drunk.

29:38.319 --> 29:41.059
More often than I should.

29:43.898 --> 29:45.601
Well, that's got
to be...

29:48.440 --> 29:53.383
Well, I'm sure that wasn't
easy for you to say.

29:53.383 --> 29:55.655
I think it's important
that you did.

29:55.655 --> 29:58.159
You know, realizing that
this is something

29:58.159 --> 30:00.230
you need to look into.

30:00.230 --> 30:03.537
And I appreciate...

30:03.537 --> 30:07.144
No, I'm <i>honored</i>

30:07.144 --> 30:09.281
that you would share that
with me.

30:11.018 --> 30:13.056
MURTAUGH: I mean,
I know I'm your partner and all,

30:13.056 --> 30:17.699
but‐‐ and I don't even care
if this is reciprocal or not‐‐

30:17.699 --> 30:21.105
but I consider you a friend.

30:21.105 --> 30:23.309
(laughs softly)

30:23.309 --> 30:25.213
Yeah, it's true.

30:25.213 --> 30:28.119
I mean, you don't... you don't
have to say anything,

30:28.119 --> 30:30.457
just... just process it.

30:34.165 --> 30:37.572
Riggs, you processing?

30:39.609 --> 30:41.479
Riggs?

30:45.555 --> 30:47.525
Riggs!
(voice echoes in church)

30:50.063 --> 30:51.633
(whispers):
Sorry.

30:58.146 --> 31:00.383
(door opens, hinges creaking)

31:02.187 --> 31:03.657
Oh, right here.
Let's see.

31:03.657 --> 31:05.460
Uh‐huh.

31:10.671 --> 31:12.207
RIGGS:
Bingo.

31:15.347 --> 31:17.585
Hey, what you got behind
this door right here?

31:17.585 --> 31:19.656
A maintenance room‐‐
it's where Reuben keeps

31:19.656 --> 31:21.492
supplies for the grounds,
for the soup kitchen.

31:21.492 --> 31:25.601
The soup guy who had
the little tiny crackers?

31:30.143 --> 31:32.314
(hinges creak)

31:46.275 --> 31:47.679
I'll be damned.

31:53.590 --> 31:57.297
Marty. I heard
I might find you here.

31:57.297 --> 32:02.240
Uh, it's almost
never true. Um...

32:02.240 --> 32:04.378
We're gonna need the room
a few minutes.
You know what,
I gotta go, too.

32:04.378 --> 32:07.317
We've got this
vigilante killer...
You'll take a minute!

32:09.121 --> 32:11.827
For me.

32:11.827 --> 32:15.668
We missed you
Friday night.

32:20.276 --> 32:25.220
Catholic Church gives a grieving
spouse a year and a day

32:25.220 --> 32:28.092
to mourn a loved one.

32:28.092 --> 32:31.265
I‐I know you're not
a religious man, but...

32:31.265 --> 32:32.401
Friday was a year and a day.

32:32.401 --> 32:34.304
That's why I
picked the date.

32:34.304 --> 32:35.574
Anna and I knew

32:35.574 --> 32:39.816
this first one
was gonna be difficult.

32:39.816 --> 32:43.289
But we wanted
to mark it,

32:43.289 --> 32:44.859
to remember Miranda.

32:44.859 --> 32:47.364
With family.

32:47.364 --> 32:50.403
With friends.

32:50.403 --> 32:53.376
Everyone she loved.

32:53.376 --> 32:54.846
You were her husband.

32:56.516 --> 32:58.219
I still am.

32:58.219 --> 33:00.891
What were you doing Friday night

33:00.891 --> 33:03.697
that you couldn't
make it?

33:05.634 --> 33:08.439
I was in no shape
to be around people.

33:08.439 --> 33:10.845
From what I've heard,

33:10.845 --> 33:15.521
you're in no condition a lot.

33:15.521 --> 33:18.359
(exhales)
Ronnie, listen...

33:18.359 --> 33:19.461
Marty.

33:19.461 --> 33:21.766
You want to be a drunk,

33:21.766 --> 33:23.670
you be a drunk.

33:25.508 --> 33:29.716
But I won't allow you

33:29.716 --> 33:33.590
to blame my
daughter for it.

33:46.783 --> 33:49.354
MURTAUGH:
<i>There's a BOLO out</i>

33:49.354 --> 33:50.958
on Reuben Tomar's car.

33:50.958 --> 33:52.695
LAX, bus station, train station,
all have been alerted.

33:52.695 --> 33:54.899
Okay. So, what do
we know about him?
He grew up

33:54.899 --> 33:56.803
in St. Valens Church
after losing both parents.

33:56.803 --> 33:59.274
MURTAUGH: His father
was a violent alcoholic.

33:59.274 --> 34:00.209
He beat his mother to death.

34:00.209 --> 34:01.913
Actually got sent away
to prison for it.

34:01.913 --> 34:04.217
We have a problem.
Father Patterson is M. I. A.

34:04.217 --> 34:06.455
Hospital security has
his car in the parking lot.

34:06.455 --> 34:08.292
Sign of struggle
and blood on the seat.

34:08.292 --> 34:09.562
Why would Ruben take his priest?

34:09.562 --> 34:10.764
Maybe he wanted
to repent.

34:10.764 --> 34:12.535
Pretty sure
that's not how it works.

34:13.503 --> 34:16.275
(grunts)

34:16.275 --> 34:18.245
AVERY: <i>Okay.</i>
<i>Valerie Rausch, Dale Reynolds.</i>

34:18.245 --> 34:21.285
Reuben went after them
for a reason. Why them? Why now?

34:21.285 --> 34:23.222
Ruben found out they got away
with murder during confession.

34:23.222 --> 34:25.259
<i>So he punished them</i>
<i>the same way</i>

34:25.259 --> 34:27.263
<i>they committed their crimes.</i>

34:27.263 --> 34:28.199
If Father Patterson knew

34:28.199 --> 34:29.468
that Reuben's dad
was abusing his mom,

34:29.468 --> 34:32.808
<i>he sure as hell would hold him</i>
<i>accountable as well.</i>

34:34.444 --> 34:36.348
Reuben, stop.

34:36.348 --> 34:38.687
God will forgive you.

34:38.687 --> 34:40.758
Like you forgave my father.

34:41.693 --> 34:44.699
You freed
him of sin.

34:44.699 --> 34:47.605
Instead of saving my mom.

34:49.007 --> 34:53.750
So now, you are going to
suffer as she suffered.

34:53.750 --> 34:55.988
(leather belt creaking)

34:55.988 --> 34:59.327
Dad liked to use belts.

34:59.327 --> 35:01.331
Did he tell you that?

35:01.331 --> 35:03.202
When he confessed to you?

35:07.210 --> 35:09.314
The BOLO paid off. Here's Reuben
blowing a red light

35:09.314 --> 35:11.452
on Normandie and Sunset
about 15 minutes ago.

35:11.452 --> 35:13.790
Well, that's just a couple of
blocks from his childhood home.

35:13.790 --> 35:15.293
The apartment
where his mother died.

35:15.293 --> 35:16.495
Yep.
Go.

35:16.495 --> 35:18.199
♪ ♪

35:21.573 --> 35:23.409
Stay with me, Father.

35:23.409 --> 35:25.313
Please.

35:25.313 --> 35:27.250
No more.

35:32.862 --> 35:35.934
I read the
coroner's report.

35:38.005 --> 35:40.343
He hit her

35:40.343 --> 35:42.615
39 times

35:42.615 --> 35:44.417
before she died.

35:44.417 --> 35:46.923
I'm only up to ten.

35:49.060 --> 35:52.433
My mother could take it.

35:52.433 --> 35:54.371
So can you.

35:58.747 --> 36:01.385
Childhood home
of deranged serial killer?

36:01.385 --> 36:02.888
Seems kind of textbook.

36:06.863 --> 36:09.535
(whispers):
Is that the house?
Mm‐hmm.

36:09.535 --> 36:10.737

36:20.423 --> 36:21.659

36:21.659 --> 36:24.364

36:25.567 --> 36:27.003

Ambulance on their way.

36:32.313 --> 36:34.384

36:40.731 --> 36:42.601
Uh‐uh‐uh. Come on.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.404
You need to come with me.

36:46.809 --> 36:48.947
I'd rather go with God.

36:48.947 --> 36:52.621
Eh, that's not
really a good option.

36:52.621 --> 36:53.957
You know.

36:55.694 --> 36:57.063
Look.

36:57.063 --> 36:59.367
I mean, I know
it's majestic,

36:59.367 --> 37:02.574

37:06.481 --> 37:08.920

37:43.055 --> 37:46.094
Rog. It's okay. It's okay.

37:46.094 --> 37:49.034
No. I'm not letting you go!

37:52.006 --> 37:53.676
Ow!

37:53.676 --> 37:55.714

37:55.714 --> 37:57.551
Rog! You need to let me go, Rog!

this tree was down here?

38:17.056 --> 38:19.962
I can't believe you hit me!
Well...

38:23.570 --> 38:25.707
AVERY:
So, I read your report.

38:25.707 --> 38:27.878
Have some questions.
You shouldn't.
Everything's in there.

38:27.878 --> 38:30.550
The shiner.
Walk me through that.

38:30.550 --> 38:32.019
You're on the roof
with the suspect.

38:32.019 --> 38:33.690
When did he punch you?

38:34.625 --> 38:36.762
Suspect did not punch me.

38:36.762 --> 38:38.600
Then who... Please, don't say

38:38.600 --> 38:40.169
Riggs.
Riggs.

38:40.169 --> 38:41.606
(clears throat)

38:41.606 --> 38:43.810
Do me a favor.
If Delgado asks, tell him...

38:43.810 --> 38:45.680
Baseball to the face,
got hit by space debris,

38:45.680 --> 38:46.749
swordfishing accident...

38:46.749 --> 38:49.487
Yes. Any of those things.

38:49.487 --> 38:51.124
Why did he do it?

38:53.596 --> 38:55.634
It's not his fault.

38:55.634 --> 38:58.806
I had it coming.

38:58.806 --> 39:02.413
I tried to save his life.

39:05.019 --> 39:06.989
(sighs)

39:12.868 --> 39:14.972
(exhales)

39:16.441 --> 39:19.915
Quite the watering hole
you got here, Ronnie.

39:24.625 --> 39:26.796
Can I buy you another drink?

39:30.971 --> 39:33.776
Get another one of these
and a club soda. Thanks.

39:33.776 --> 39:35.814

39:35.814 --> 39:37.951

about her.

39:47.704 --> 39:49.173
Little things.

39:49.173 --> 39:51.512
God knows I don't want to,

39:51.512 --> 39:53.516
but, um... I am

39:53.516 --> 39:56.221

anything about it.

39:56.221 --> 39:58.593
So let us help you through it.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.805
Look.

40:09.213 --> 40:12.086
I really appreciate everything
you've done for me.

40:13.155 --> 40:15.092
I do.

40:15.960 --> 40:18.833
I can't do this.

40:18.833 --> 40:20.637
I think it's best

see you guys anymore.

40:25.312 --> 40:27.584

You're our family.
