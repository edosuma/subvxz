00:01.502 --> 00:04.237
Crime fighting gets an upgrade on APB.

00:04.238 --> 00:06.238
- So, are you impressed?
- Wow.

00:06.240 --> 00:09.070
Catch all new episodes Mondays. And
check out our other fox programs.

00:09.076 --> 00:12.206
Bones, Sleepy Hollow and 24: Legacy.

00:12.212 --> 00:14.952
- Why does it need to be you?
- I'm the only one I can trust.

00:14.953 --> 00:16.078
Only on Fox

00:17.535 --> 00:19.235
A maverick billionaire...

00:19.237 --> 00:21.140
My name is Gideon Reeves.

00:21.143 --> 00:24.550
I built an empire making
rockets, computers, robots...

00:24.552 --> 00:27.854
Made over $100 billion.
Know how I did it?

00:27.856 --> 00:29.489
I'm an engineer.

00:29.491 --> 00:31.357
... touched by tragedy...

00:31.359 --> 00:33.493
- The money!
- No!

00:33.495 --> 00:35.094
My friend has been shot.

00:35.096 --> 00:36.863
Where the hell are you people?!

00:36.865 --> 00:39.699
... takes on the biggest
engineering challenge

00:39.701 --> 00:40.900
of his career...

00:40.902 --> 00:42.402
I want justice for Elliot James Sully.

00:42.404 --> 00:45.104
Give me the 13th District to run.

00:45.106 --> 00:47.774
A civilian can't take
over a police district.

00:47.776 --> 00:50.143
They can, with a special
appointment from this committee.

00:50.145 --> 00:53.012
... to revolutionize a police force...

00:53.014 --> 00:55.014
Technology doesn't solve cases, cops do.

00:55.016 --> 00:56.582
You haven't met my technology.

00:59.287 --> 01:01.454
Wow...

01:01.456 --> 01:03.256
... and save a city.

01:03.258 --> 01:05.522
You guys are my partners.

01:05.525 --> 01:07.059
We're gonna change the world.

01:30.752 --> 01:33.786
Hi, I'm Gideon Reeves,

01:33.788 --> 01:35.488
billionaire, inventor,

01:35.490 --> 01:38.458
and new head of Chicago's
13th police district.

01:38.460 --> 01:40.793
If you're seeing this, you are one

01:40.795 --> 01:43.429
of 378,000 people in this city

01:43.431 --> 01:44.964
who've already downloaded

01:44.966 --> 01:48.314
my new APB crime-fighting app.

01:49.504 --> 01:54.273
Shortly after launch, we had
over 5,000 APB crime reports.

01:54.275 --> 01:56.709
With a fancy bit of computer engineering

01:56.711 --> 02:00.947
and a little help
from my brilliant team,

02:00.949 --> 02:02.348
we routed every one of those calls

02:02.350 --> 02:04.250
to the local 911 operators.

02:04.252 --> 02:07.720
Not just the calls... GPS info, video.

02:07.722 --> 02:09.088
All kinds of good stuff.

02:09.090 --> 02:11.891
You know what? Rather than tell ya,

02:11.893 --> 02:15.495
why don't I just show ya?

02:29.344 --> 02:30.977
See, up until now, thanks to

02:30.979 --> 02:33.212
short-sighted budget cuts by the mayor,

02:33.214 --> 02:35.581
criminals have had such an easy time.

02:35.583 --> 02:39.252
They've been, well,
robbing the candy store.

02:39.254 --> 02:40.953
There you go, take
that. Good. Take that.

02:40.955 --> 02:42.955
You get the big one.

02:42.957 --> 02:44.423
We're reinventing policing,

02:44.425 --> 02:46.792
and we're catching the bad guys.

02:46.794 --> 02:49.595
Thanks to the hard work
of Chicago's finest,

02:49.597 --> 02:52.331
we are about to take a
brand-new bite out of crime...

02:52.333 --> 02:55.935
All in record time, I
might add. Hey, Murph.

02:55.937 --> 02:57.803
Gideon, are you serious?

02:57.805 --> 03:00.473
She's right, I better wrap it up.

03:00.475 --> 03:02.241
Here's the bottom line.

03:02.243 --> 03:05.044
The mayor can talk all he
wants about Chicago's problems.

03:05.046 --> 03:08.714
Thanks to the APB app...

03:08.716 --> 03:11.150
I'm here to offer solutions.

03:12.346 --> 03:13.846
And jelly beans.

03:15.490 --> 03:17.490
I love jelly beans.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.561
In the electronic communication blast

03:21.563 --> 03:23.262
through his popular APB app,

03:23.264 --> 03:25.164
maverick billionaire Gideon Reeves

03:25.166 --> 03:27.033
- may have had some sweet...
- Just one moment.

03:27.035 --> 03:29.702
... to offer Chicago's
crime-weary citizens today...

03:29.704 --> 03:31.237
Sorry. Can I help you?

03:31.239 --> 03:33.039
Hello?

03:33.041 --> 03:34.740
Give me the keys to the cabinet. Now!

03:34.742 --> 03:36.505
- All right, all right, just please...
- Let's go!

03:36.507 --> 03:38.841
Don't do anyth... Oh!

03:44.152 --> 03:45.851
Okay, I assume

03:45.853 --> 03:48.020
everybody saw today's
little demonstration.

03:48.022 --> 03:49.922
Yes, everybody catch that?

03:49.924 --> 03:51.324
So here's the deal.

03:51.326 --> 03:53.809
In my experience, the best thing to do

03:53.812 --> 03:55.607
with politicians is to go around them.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.697
You go through them, you
get bloody, and my suits

03:57.699 --> 03:59.899
and your fancy new uniforms
are too nice for that.

03:59.901 --> 04:02.935
Now, I want you all to know
these aren't just words.

04:02.937 --> 04:05.004
I'm here to start a revolution.

04:05.006 --> 04:06.205
And you know where that starts?

04:06.207 --> 04:08.307
Not with the new guns or the drones,

04:08.309 --> 04:10.109
amazing though they may be.

04:10.111 --> 04:12.511
It starts with all of you.

04:12.513 --> 04:13.879
Murphy, could you...

04:15.450 --> 04:17.048
As you probably heard,

04:17.051 --> 04:19.785
I recently promoted
Murphy here to detective,

04:19.786 --> 04:22.788
and yet... gonna blow your minds here...

04:22.790 --> 04:24.991
She's still in uniform,
she's not wearing a pantsuit,

04:24.993 --> 04:27.760
sitting at a desk. Why?

04:27.762 --> 04:31.564
Because studies have shown

04:31.566 --> 04:33.432
it's the beat cops
that have the knowledge

04:33.434 --> 04:34.767
and the relationships

04:34.769 --> 04:36.002
to get crimes solved

04:36.004 --> 04:37.595
and cases closed.

04:37.598 --> 04:39.639
So why do we take
detectives off the street?

04:39.641 --> 04:41.774
Well, now we don't.

04:41.776 --> 04:43.576
And it doesn't stop there.

04:43.578 --> 04:45.678
Paperwork? Guess what,
you don't do it anymore.

04:45.680 --> 04:48.314
Mm-hmm. How about evidence logging? No.

04:48.316 --> 04:49.782
- There's a computerized...
- Gideon!

04:49.784 --> 04:52.461
Oh, God, Ada, I'm kinda
revolutionizing here.

04:52.464 --> 04:54.020
Uh, yeah, but I just got an APB call.

04:54.022 --> 04:55.187
There's a robbery at a pharmacy.

04:55.189 --> 04:56.789
I-I called it out, but
this station is closer

04:56.791 --> 04:58.224
than any of the units on patrol...

04:58.226 --> 04:59.225
I'm on it.

04:59.228 --> 05:00.860
You know what? Me, too.

05:00.862 --> 05:03.466
Disruption, guys.

05:03.469 --> 05:04.560
You get it.

05:08.202 --> 05:10.136
1309 squad responding.

05:10.138 --> 05:11.237
Ooh!

05:12.310 --> 05:16.442
1309, we've got three
separate APB reports.

05:16.444 --> 05:18.778
Got a Caucasian male, masked,

05:18.780 --> 05:20.279
approximately five eight.

05:20.281 --> 05:21.547
I'm sending video now.

05:21.549 --> 05:23.282
Copy.

05:24.986 --> 05:27.153
You sure this a good
idea, you being here?

05:27.155 --> 05:29.288
Come on, you heard me back there.

05:29.290 --> 05:30.456
This is what it's all about,

05:30.458 --> 05:32.658
helping you be the best
cops that you can be...

05:32.660 --> 05:33.626
Changing it up

05:33.628 --> 05:35.227
Yeah, I don't know about that.

05:35.229 --> 05:37.229
You're changing a lot of tradition.

05:37.231 --> 05:39.065
The cars, the uniforms, the robots.

05:39.067 --> 05:41.367
Maybe, you know, learn a little bit

05:41.369 --> 05:43.269
before you just bust things up.

05:43.271 --> 05:44.995
That's what I'm here for, to learn.

05:44.998 --> 05:47.274
Yeah, but then you're gonna
change everything else, too.

05:47.275 --> 05:48.674
Yeah. See, you're getting it.

05:48.676 --> 05:50.676
1309, be advised.

05:50.678 --> 05:52.378
Looks like the suspect
is on the move now,

05:52.380 --> 05:54.747
- going westbound on Division.
- Copy that.

05:54.749 --> 05:56.982
From your position, you should
be able to pick him up...

05:56.984 --> 05:59.351
Oh!

05:59.353 --> 06:00.953
I think we just did.

06:02.924 --> 06:04.423
So how does this work, exactly?

06:04.425 --> 06:05.357
We just stay on him

06:05.359 --> 06:07.226
and set up a roadblock.

06:07.228 --> 06:09.328
He's not too worried
about sticking to the road.

06:09.330 --> 06:11.310
What the hell is he doing?

06:15.873 --> 06:17.041
Son of a bitch!

06:19.173 --> 06:21.807
Oh, my God.

06:24.045 --> 06:26.645
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

06:28.947 --> 06:30.850
We need an ambulance at Rawlings Park.

06:30.852 --> 06:32.218
- 11th and Dover.
- Copy.

06:32.220 --> 06:35.421
Emily, baby, please...

06:35.423 --> 06:37.757
Emily... Baby, please.

06:37.759 --> 06:40.459
Emily!

... <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> ...

06:50.952 --> 06:53.266
Gideon, we're still combing
through all of the surveillance

06:53.268 --> 06:55.307
video, looking for any sign
of our hit-and-run driver.

06:55.309 --> 06:56.842
We have units out everywhere,

06:56.844 --> 06:59.578
- but nothing's turned up yet.
- Well, keep looking.

06:59.580 --> 07:01.981
- Every resource we have.
- Okay.

07:01.983 --> 07:04.717
Mr. Reeves, sir, we are
trying to do everything we can,

07:04.719 --> 07:07.520
but since Captain Hauser
tendered his resignation, we...

07:07.522 --> 07:09.255
Wait, Hauser resigned?

07:09.257 --> 07:11.290
Sorry, I thought you would have heard

07:11.292 --> 07:12.525
from the union by now.

07:12.527 --> 07:14.093
Says he wouldn't come to work anymore

07:14.095 --> 07:15.461
until you've packed your money bags

07:15.463 --> 07:17.363
and moved back to Smartassville.

07:17.365 --> 07:19.765
His words, sir, not mine.

07:19.767 --> 07:21.934
That's cute. Uh, no, I'm-I'm staying.

07:21.936 --> 07:23.269
Fine by me,

07:23.271 --> 07:24.637
but no one here has the stripes

07:24.639 --> 07:26.939
to authorize overtime and extra shifts.

07:26.941 --> 07:29.708
In that case, congratulations.

07:29.710 --> 07:30.910
I'm sorry?

07:30.912 --> 07:33.189
I read your file. 30-plus
years on the force.

07:33.192 --> 07:34.658
Everybody likes you. Hell, I like you.

07:34.660 --> 07:37.500
I don't even really know you.
So you are it, Captain Conrad.

07:37.503 --> 07:38.605
Carry on.

07:42.790 --> 07:44.723
He does that kind of thing a lot.

07:50.932 --> 07:52.031
Ma'am?

07:54.435 --> 07:57.436
Uh...

07:57.438 --> 07:59.939
how's she doing?

07:59.941 --> 08:01.907
Doctors don't know.

08:01.909 --> 08:05.744
She hasn't woke up since the accident.

08:05.746 --> 08:07.880
She's got swelling in her brain.

08:07.882 --> 08:09.615
They say if it goes
down, she's got a shot.

08:09.617 --> 08:10.916
But if it don't...

08:15.489 --> 08:17.389
You got any kids?

08:17.391 --> 08:19.124
I do.

08:19.126 --> 08:22.094
A son. His name is Mateo.

08:22.096 --> 08:24.196
Then you know how it is.

08:26.634 --> 08:28.267
But you...

08:28.269 --> 08:31.003
When we heard you were
coming into the 13th,

08:31.005 --> 08:35.674
a lot of us thought, maybe, finally

08:35.676 --> 08:38.984
things were gonna get better.

08:38.986 --> 08:41.179
I even started taking Emily to the park.

08:44.051 --> 08:45.818
You know how long it's been

08:45.820 --> 08:48.787
since we felt safe doing that?

08:50.324 --> 08:53.659
I guess we weren't
as safe as we thought.

09:01.903 --> 09:04.737
Well, Detective, you
got your first case.

09:04.739 --> 09:06.071
Gideon, are you sure?

09:06.073 --> 09:08.440
I mean, this is a heater
case with a lot of eyes on it.

09:08.442 --> 09:10.276
And we still haven't even
finished our conversation

09:10.278 --> 09:11.644
from when you gave me the badge.

09:11.646 --> 09:13.145
Cool. Let's finish it right now.

09:13.147 --> 09:15.214
Someone just ran down a
little girl in my district.

09:15.216 --> 09:16.815
So here's how we're gonna do this.

09:16.817 --> 09:19.618
Wear whatever you want.
Drive whatever you want.

09:19.620 --> 09:22.821
Set your own hours, do
whatever the hell it takes,

09:22.823 --> 09:24.823
just get the job done.

09:27.228 --> 09:28.994
Yes, sir.

09:39.265 --> 09:40.666
I went through the files,

09:40.668 --> 09:42.602
and it turns out that
the guy we're looking for

09:42.604 --> 09:43.803
isn't a beginner.

09:43.805 --> 09:45.538
This is the fifth pharmacy he's hit up

09:45.540 --> 09:47.006
in the same general area.

09:47.008 --> 09:49.675
Targets small shops, gets
into the narcotics lockup,

09:49.677 --> 09:51.077
and rides out like a bat out of hell.

09:51.079 --> 09:52.979
- Any clue who he is?
- Unfortunately, no.

09:52.981 --> 09:54.113
But he clearly knows what he's doing.

09:54.115 --> 09:55.770
We have some basic
weight and height info,

09:55.773 --> 09:57.650
but no fingerprints and no face.

09:57.652 --> 09:59.852
We sent a description of
the car to the APB app.

09:59.854 --> 10:01.154
We've been getting calls all morning.

10:01.156 --> 10:02.421
It's a really common car,

10:02.423 --> 10:04.123
so we've been getting a lot of hits.

10:04.125 --> 10:06.425
I narrowed the results by
eliminating cars registered

10:06.427 --> 10:08.928
within a ten-mile
radius of the robbery.

10:08.930 --> 10:09.962
Well, he obviously is not

10:09.964 --> 10:12.265
registering his getaway car, right?

10:12.267 --> 10:14.233
- Yeah, I'd say that's a safe bet.
- Better...

10:14.235 --> 10:16.969
but still nothing to
nail anyone specific.

10:16.971 --> 10:19.707
Actually, I can help with that.

10:19.710 --> 10:21.607
We got a report that the
gunman tossed his mask

10:21.609 --> 10:23.242
on the way out of the pharmacy.

10:23.244 --> 10:25.178
Brandt and Goss managed to recover it.

10:25.180 --> 10:26.946
DNA.

10:26.948 --> 10:28.748
Even better.

10:28.750 --> 10:30.716
Here, Zingo. Here, boy.

10:30.718 --> 10:32.518
Sniff, yeah, there you go.

10:32.520 --> 10:34.020
Good boy, good boy, good boy.

10:34.022 --> 10:35.555
Come on.

10:35.557 --> 10:37.223
We should get him some water soon.

10:37.225 --> 10:38.758
We got him water, like, a block ago.

10:38.760 --> 10:41.127
He's an energetic breed.
He needs hydration.

10:41.129 --> 10:43.863
Seriously, man? Oh, so
you're, like, the expert.

10:43.865 --> 10:46.065
I trained with dogs in
the army for three years.

10:46.067 --> 10:47.352
It's the only thing that kept me sane.

10:47.354 --> 10:49.116
I know when a dog's thirsty.

10:49.119 --> 10:51.703
You're still thirsty, ain't
you, boy? And what about me?

10:51.706 --> 10:53.172
Every time we're on patrol, you act like

10:53.174 --> 10:54.874
I'm torturing you
when I get an iced tea.

10:54.876 --> 10:56.175
"Oh, you gotta be kiddin' me."

10:56.177 --> 10:58.377
- That's different!
- How is it different?

10:58.379 --> 10:59.579
Because you're addicted to iced tea.

10:59.581 --> 11:01.814
It's about feeding your
sick need for caffeine.

11:01.816 --> 11:03.583
Also, Zingo? He can pee on a tree.

11:03.585 --> 11:05.184
He doesn't gotta drive
around for 40 minutes

11:05.186 --> 11:06.485
lookin' for a clean bathroom.

11:06.487 --> 11:07.587
Do you, boy?

11:07.589 --> 11:08.821
- Aw.
- Okay,

11:08.823 --> 11:11.424
this is the third location the APB app

11:11.426 --> 11:12.558
has got for our getaway car.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.794
Are you sure that the
dog is up for this?

11:14.796 --> 11:16.964
You're just disappointed
'cause it's not a robot.

11:16.966 --> 11:19.035
Trust me, these dogs
know what they're doing.

11:19.038 --> 11:21.100
It's possible to love
robots and dogs, you know.

11:21.102 --> 11:22.835
You ever watch The Jetsons?

11:22.837 --> 11:24.136
The what?

11:24.138 --> 11:25.271
Okay,

11:25.273 --> 11:26.439
here's the address.

11:29.143 --> 11:33.512
Sending the location now.

11:33.514 --> 11:34.847
Squad, 1305,

11:34.849 --> 11:36.449
copy that.

11:38.686 --> 11:40.019
Who lives there?

11:40.021 --> 11:41.721
Who doesn't, more like it.

11:41.723 --> 11:43.956
It's a mope crash pad.
It's one of those places

11:43.958 --> 11:45.224
that couldn't make it as a crackhouse.

11:45.226 --> 11:46.225
Easy, boy.

11:46.227 --> 11:47.360
He got something?

11:47.362 --> 11:49.095
Yeah. Yeah, I think he does. Go, go!

11:56.938 --> 11:59.305
Come on, Zingo!

11:59.307 --> 12:00.573
That's the car.

12:00.575 --> 12:01.841
That's the car from the robbery.

12:01.843 --> 12:03.209
The son of a bitch set it on fire.

12:04.178 --> 12:05.978
Zingo, no! Zingo!

12:05.980 --> 12:07.179
Brandt!

12:07.181 --> 12:09.048
Zingo, no! Zingo!

12:12.387 --> 12:13.419
Ugh!

12:21.529 --> 12:23.529
Oh, no! Oh, no!

12:23.531 --> 12:25.431
Oh, no, Zingo!

12:25.433 --> 12:26.832
Oh, no, no, no.

12:28.036 --> 12:29.201
All right. Zingo's hurt!

12:29.203 --> 12:31.037
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, okay, boy.
- Are you okay?

12:31.039 --> 12:32.705
Is he, uh... ?

12:32.707 --> 12:33.739
I don't know.

12:33.741 --> 12:35.028
1305. What's your status?

12:35.031 --> 12:36.375
Brandt, are you okay?

12:36.377 --> 12:38.110
Yes, I'm fine! Get help!

12:38.112 --> 12:40.313
1305. Emergency,
located offending vehicle

12:40.315 --> 12:41.814
at 567 Elm Street.

12:41.816 --> 12:44.317
Car is on fire, send CFD...

12:44.319 --> 12:45.751
and we're gonna need an ambulance.

12:46.688 --> 12:48.854
You'll be okay. All right.

12:54.662 --> 12:56.395
Just go ahead and put
that up on the lift.

12:56.397 --> 12:57.596
Hey.

12:57.598 --> 12:58.631
Am I interrupting?

12:58.633 --> 12:59.932
No, come on in.

12:59.934 --> 13:01.801
I'm at a dead end here.

13:01.803 --> 13:03.536
Me, too. Does yours have to do with

13:03.538 --> 13:06.305
the theoretical and
technical limitations

13:06.307 --> 13:07.640
of hyperspectral imaging?

13:07.642 --> 13:08.808
No.

13:10.211 --> 13:11.844
Well, let's go with yours first, then.

13:11.846 --> 13:13.079
We searched the entire house.

13:13.081 --> 13:15.117
Looks like the suspect
never even stayed there.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.316
I mean, he ditched the car in
the back and just lit it up.

13:17.318 --> 13:18.784
Uh, yeah, he certainly did.

13:18.786 --> 13:20.986
Ada says the car was stolen a month ago.

13:20.988 --> 13:22.655
Uh, she didn't get anything there.

13:22.657 --> 13:25.358
Uh, found some custom
parts in the engine...

13:25.360 --> 13:29.128
There's a nitrous oxide
system and a flashy air intake.

13:29.130 --> 13:30.996
So I'm trying to pull serial numbers,

13:30.998 --> 13:33.199
but whatever the fire didn't destroy

13:33.201 --> 13:34.633
was already filed off.

13:34.635 --> 13:36.168
Wait, these are recent mods?

13:36.170 --> 13:37.803
Like, they were just put in the car?

13:37.805 --> 13:40.840
Yeah, there's less carbonized
grease on new stuff.

13:40.842 --> 13:43.609
Maybe I should order a
scanning electron microscope.

13:43.611 --> 13:45.711
Hang on, Gideon. I might have an idea.

13:45.713 --> 13:48.514
I've been chasing these racers
in the 13th for ten years.

13:48.516 --> 13:50.583
There's only like four
places in this district

13:50.585 --> 13:51.851
that sell stuff like that,

13:51.853 --> 13:54.120
and only one that would
actually work on a stolen car.

13:54.122 --> 13:56.655
Grab that stuff. We got
a garage to go check out.

14:01.929 --> 14:05.364
You know all these cruisers
have stereos, right?

14:05.366 --> 14:06.999
We should have some detecting music.

14:07.001 --> 14:09.101
- Detecting music?
- Yeah.

14:09.103 --> 14:11.237
You had your little
detective moment back there,

14:11.239 --> 14:13.305
and now we're gonna go
and talk to a bad guy, so,

14:13.307 --> 14:15.408
do you who Dime Store Darlings are?

14:15.410 --> 14:16.909
No.

14:16.911 --> 14:18.344
Okay, look, when we get there,

14:18.346 --> 14:20.546
I'm gonna go inside and
you're gonna stay in the car.

14:20.548 --> 14:22.248
Once everything's settled,
I'll come back and get you.

14:22.250 --> 14:23.616
Settled?

14:23.618 --> 14:24.984
That doesn't like much fun.

14:24.986 --> 14:26.919
Yeah, well, you're not
on a field trip, Gideon.

14:26.921 --> 14:28.421
We're on a trip, we're in the field.

14:28.423 --> 14:30.189
No. You're not a cop.

14:30.191 --> 14:31.991
You just happen to
own a police district.

14:31.993 --> 14:33.692
Shouldn't I at least get, like, a badge?

14:33.694 --> 14:35.928
- I dropped $90 million!
- Dios mío.

14:35.930 --> 14:37.163
It's like I have another kid.

14:54.410 --> 14:55.948
Hey.

14:55.950 --> 14:57.817
Oh, my God.

14:57.819 --> 14:59.151
Didn't I tell you to stay in the car?

14:59.153 --> 15:01.587
Yeah. I ignored you.

15:02.924 --> 15:04.924
Listen, right, I know this guy.

15:04.926 --> 15:06.292
He can be a little jumpy.

15:06.294 --> 15:08.594
So I don't want to be the cop
that broke the billionaire.

15:08.596 --> 15:12.164
Well, "to avoid risk
is to avoid progress."

15:12.167 --> 15:15.067
- Who said that?
- Me...

15:15.069 --> 15:17.703
New York Times, August 2014.

15:17.705 --> 15:20.940
Seriously, you've gotta start
reading some of my interviews.

15:20.942 --> 15:21.907
You're gonna follow me in there

15:21.909 --> 15:23.175
no matter what I say, aren't you?

15:23.177 --> 15:26.712
"Never listen to no":
Wired magazine, 2011.

15:26.714 --> 15:29.682
Fine. Just do exactly as I say, okay?

15:29.684 --> 15:30.816
- Hmm?
- Okay.

15:36.924 --> 15:38.491
What?

15:42.029 --> 15:45.931
Damn, we're good.

15:47.201 --> 15:49.380
I'm telling you, I don't
know anything about it.

15:49.383 --> 15:50.870
Ryan, buddy... .

15:50.872 --> 15:52.471
Do you remember the
first time I busted you?

15:52.473 --> 15:55.641
- No.
- I do. You were 16 years old,

15:55.643 --> 15:57.910
and you were a bad liar then
and you're a bad liar now.

15:57.912 --> 16:00.446
- Did we find what we were looking for?
- Yeah,

16:00.448 --> 16:02.982
found a match for the air intake,

16:02.984 --> 16:05.351
and this is definitely
the nitrous system.

16:05.353 --> 16:06.752
That don't prove nothin'.

16:06.754 --> 16:09.555
You want to arrest me? Go ahead.

16:09.557 --> 16:10.656
You got me there.

16:10.658 --> 16:13.392
They would never
approve a felony charge.

16:13.394 --> 16:15.828
Guess I'll just have to take you home.

16:15.830 --> 16:16.840
Home?

16:16.843 --> 16:18.597
Yeah, your mom still
lives on Fairfield, right?

16:18.599 --> 16:21.066
Yeah, but I don't want no ride home.

16:21.068 --> 16:22.635
No, honestly, it's really not a problem.

16:22.637 --> 16:23.936
I mean, but I'm gonna have to tell her

16:23.938 --> 16:25.304
that you sold those parts,

16:25.306 --> 16:28.707
and that you may or may not have
helped a guy who ran over a kid.

16:28.709 --> 16:30.009
But you can just tell
her what you told me,

16:30.011 --> 16:31.176
that you don't know anything. Come on.

16:31.178 --> 16:33.812
Wait, wait! Oh... Hold on.

16:33.814 --> 16:35.714
I didn't know, okay?

16:35.716 --> 16:38.284
- He came to me, and he wanted...
- What? What?

16:38.286 --> 16:39.985
Who-who came to you?

16:41.989 --> 16:45.057
Jed Baxter. He did some time upstate.

16:45.059 --> 16:47.326
Wanted me to trick out
his ride. Paid cash.

16:47.328 --> 16:49.795
I-I thought he was just a racer, but...

16:49.797 --> 16:52.164
then I heard about what happened.

16:52.166 --> 16:53.198
I got scared.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.334
- Do you know where I can find him?
- No.

16:55.336 --> 16:58.003
I swear to God. All I know
is that he got a new ride:

16:58.005 --> 17:00.139
a red muscle car with a big-bore V8.

17:00.141 --> 17:01.740
Came by looking for a racing carburetor.

17:01.742 --> 17:05.310
I told him he was too
hot, so I sent him away.

17:05.313 --> 17:06.412
Really?

17:06.414 --> 17:08.113
You sure about that?

17:08.115 --> 17:09.781
Okay, so I sold him the car.

17:09.784 --> 17:11.849
But I told him I
wasn't gonna install it.

17:11.852 --> 17:15.354
Look, you don't
understand... Jed's hard-core.

17:15.356 --> 17:18.089
Like... serious.

17:18.092 --> 17:20.259
If you guys don't catch him,
and he finds out that I talked...

17:20.261 --> 17:21.660
Have a little faith.

17:21.662 --> 17:25.564
I put a probe on Titan, I can
handle a moron in a muscle car.

17:33.774 --> 17:34.740
Is it ready?

17:34.775 --> 17:36.009
- We're still testing...
- Pete...

17:37.045 --> 17:40.313
- I need it. Is it ready?
- I... I think so, sir.

17:40.348 --> 17:42.682
You think, or you know?

17:42.717 --> 17:44.550
I'd say closer to the latter, sir.

17:44.586 --> 17:47.353
Cool. Show me.

17:47.388 --> 17:48.654
All right.

17:48.690 --> 17:51.357
So...

17:51.813 --> 17:53.871
We streamlined the original design

17:53.873 --> 17:57.642
based on your prototype, and
we added fins for stability.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.744
The big challenge was the engine.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.180
We were able to put together
a one-fifth scale version

18:02.182 --> 18:05.550
based on the E-bike motor
from the transpo division...

18:05.552 --> 18:07.718
and we came up with this.

18:10.323 --> 18:14.158
The new Reeves Mark I
Police Interceptor Drone.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.561
You made that?

18:17.564 --> 18:19.263
Yes, sir, I did.

18:21.201 --> 18:24.435
A week earlier than it was due.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.504
If you'll forgive me for saying so, sir,

18:26.506 --> 18:30.308
your impatience is a known
engineering parameter.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.411
Good. Bring it to my car.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.747
And Pete... grab all your stuff.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.149
You're coming to Law Enforcement,

18:38.151 --> 18:39.850
effective immediately.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.959
The blast sent shrapnel
flying into the bone

18:47.961 --> 18:50.728
here, here, and here.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.396
The damage is severe.

18:52.398 --> 18:53.397
What does that mean?

18:53.399 --> 18:55.733
Does he get, like, a cast, or... ?

18:55.735 --> 18:57.699
We're not going to be
able to save the leg.

18:57.702 --> 18:59.837
You're kidding me.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.772
He's a working dog. If he can't work...

19:01.774 --> 19:02.974
I know.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.442
That's one of the reasons why we think

19:04.444 --> 19:06.210
the best thing for Zingo might be to...

19:06.212 --> 19:08.145
Shut the hell up.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.880
You shut the hell up, I
don't even want to hear that,

19:09.882 --> 19:11.215
- you understand me?
- Brandt, Brandt...

19:11.217 --> 19:13.618
it's not his fault the dog got hurt.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.153
Now get the hell out of here. Go!

19:16.155 --> 19:18.422
I'll be over there in a minute.

19:22.061 --> 19:23.628
I'm sorry. Look,

19:23.630 --> 19:27.632
dogs like Zingo got my partner
through two tours in Iraq, so...

19:27.634 --> 19:29.767
if there's anything you can do...

19:29.769 --> 19:31.769
Yeah. I understand.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.671
Okay.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.941
Here's the situation:

19:36.943 --> 19:39.343
okay, everybody knows we've
been looking for the man

19:39.345 --> 19:40.678
behind the pharmacy robberies

19:40.680 --> 19:43.080
and the hit-and-run
of Emily Jimenez.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.449
Well, last night, we got a break.

19:45.451 --> 19:47.118
We're looking for Jed Baxter:

19:47.120 --> 19:49.553
local boy, did five
years in the I.D.O.C.

19:49.555 --> 19:50.988
Drives a red sports car.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.491
Consider him armed and dangerous.

19:53.493 --> 19:56.360
You have all his info in your beat cars.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.696
Keep your eyes open.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.731
Work your contacts.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.767
Let's get this guy.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.043
A little girl got hurt.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.544
The girl's almost dead this morning.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.578
I know...

20:14.580 --> 20:16.781
Think you can run one for me?

20:16.783 --> 20:19.250
All right, so have you owned
this car since it was new?

20:19.252 --> 20:20.584
No.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.216
Hold it.

20:52.218 --> 20:53.751
Okay.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.619
1312. Emergency squad.

20:55.621 --> 20:58.823
I am looking at a red sedan,
occupant matches the description

20:58.825 --> 20:59.857
of the wanted suspect.

20:59.859 --> 21:00.967
You guys gettin' this?

21:00.970 --> 21:02.226
Yeah, we're with you, Cobb.

21:02.228 --> 21:04.128
Requesting backup right now.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.963
Try not to spook him, please.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.233
Yeah, well, that's a negative, squad,

21:09.235 --> 21:10.534
he is officially spooked.

21:16.425 --> 21:17.742
Hey, Murphy.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.677
10-4, squad, 1309 responding.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.206
Already on my way.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.730
Uh...

21:39.732 --> 21:41.499
I lost him.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.601
I lost him, guys.

21:43.603 --> 21:45.002
Murph, he's eastbound

21:45.004 --> 21:46.070
on Monroe.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.438
Get him there.

21:59.035 --> 22:00.651
Doing great, Murph.

22:00.653 --> 22:01.986
You just stay on him.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.654
It's not as easy as it looks, you know.

22:03.656 --> 22:04.755
Well,

22:04.757 --> 22:06.891
I am right behind you.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.737
Oh!

22:25.678 --> 22:26.777
Is he okay?

22:26.779 --> 22:28.913
- Yeah?
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.014
Gideon, he lost us.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.917
Speak for yourself.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.460
Down in the tunnel. Hey!

22:53.673 --> 22:56.173
Ah, you can do better than that!

23:01.647 --> 23:02.947
Damn it!

23:02.949 --> 23:05.091
We're losing signal down in the tunnels.

23:06.619 --> 23:07.618
Come on!

23:07.620 --> 23:08.552
Come on!

23:08.554 --> 23:10.221
Damn it!

23:25.015 --> 23:26.836
Drone's down.

23:26.839 --> 23:29.507
Drone's down. Anybody see him?

23:29.509 --> 23:31.329
Negative, boss.

23:31.332 --> 23:33.099
He's gone.

23:42.222 --> 23:44.422
Hey.

23:45.270 --> 23:46.670
Sorry about your drone.

23:46.672 --> 23:48.104
Huh? Yeah, well,

23:48.106 --> 23:51.074
you know, flying into a steel pylon

23:51.076 --> 23:52.642
at 50 miles an hour

23:52.644 --> 23:55.245
wasn't exactly in the specs.

23:55.247 --> 23:57.180
You okay?

23:57.182 --> 23:59.316
No. Not really.

23:59.318 --> 24:01.751
I made a promise, Murphy.

24:01.753 --> 24:04.187
I looked that little
girl's mom in the eye

24:04.189 --> 24:06.289
and I said that I would catch this guy.

24:06.291 --> 24:10.093
$250,000 worth of technology...

24:10.095 --> 24:11.828
gets beaten

24:11.830 --> 24:14.531
by a high school
dropout in a muscle car.

24:15.682 --> 24:16.948
What, what?

24:16.951 --> 24:19.202
How many car chases have
you been in before that?

24:19.204 --> 24:21.738
Um, that would be none.

24:21.740 --> 24:23.773
Yeah, it figures.

24:23.775 --> 24:25.375
Gideon, you're a smart guy.

24:25.377 --> 24:27.644
I know you've got satellites
and holograms and stuff,

24:27.646 --> 24:29.450
but you got to understand

24:29.453 --> 24:31.020
the bad guys are good
at what they do, too.

24:31.022 --> 24:33.011
I mean, Jed Baxter's
been running from the cops

24:33.014 --> 24:34.514
- all of his life.
- Yes,

24:34.517 --> 24:37.853
he's extraordinarily good at
pressing his foot down hard

24:37.856 --> 24:39.155
on the accelerator.

24:39.157 --> 24:41.825
You know, you're pretty
dumb for a genius sometimes.

24:41.827 --> 24:43.026
Come on.

24:43.028 --> 24:44.427
Where we going?

24:45.497 --> 24:47.163
You're going to car chase school.

24:47.165 --> 24:48.798
Is that an accredited program or... ?

24:48.800 --> 24:50.133
Let's go.

24:51.770 --> 24:53.236
I don't have to take notes, do I?

24:53.238 --> 24:55.071
I get carsick very easily.

24:55.073 --> 24:56.506
The thing you need to get here,

24:56.508 --> 24:57.874
when it comes to high-speed pursuit,

24:57.876 --> 24:59.476
is that the bad guy

24:59.478 --> 25:02.112
- almost always has an edge on us.
- You realize

25:02.114 --> 25:05.190
you're in a cruiser with
over 650 horsepower, right?

25:05.193 --> 25:07.617
Yeah, and that's great. I
mean, if we're chasing felons

25:07.619 --> 25:09.219
down a racetrack, we're gonna win

25:09.221 --> 25:10.153
every time.

25:10.155 --> 25:11.488
Look.

25:11.490 --> 25:13.657
- Look there.
- That, uh...

25:13.659 --> 25:15.630
is an alley.

25:15.633 --> 25:17.133
Well, a couple of years ago,

25:17.136 --> 25:20.230
I chased an idiot down through
there after a carjacking.

25:20.232 --> 25:21.364
He headed down the alley

25:21.366 --> 25:22.866
and took out two delivery trucks

25:22.868 --> 25:24.401
and an old refrigerator along the way.

25:24.403 --> 25:25.669
We can't do that.

25:25.671 --> 25:27.771
We'd burn through these
fancy cars in a week.

25:27.773 --> 25:29.939
You see that? Baxter didn't lose us

25:29.941 --> 25:31.741
because he drives a faster car

25:31.743 --> 25:32.876
or because he's a better driver.

25:32.878 --> 25:34.678
He lost us because he doesn't care

25:34.680 --> 25:36.892
about running people down. We do.

25:36.895 --> 25:38.461
He'll do it and he knows we won't.

25:38.464 --> 25:40.683
But the drone isn't on the street.

25:40.686 --> 25:42.018
Look, the drone's great.

25:42.020 --> 25:44.087
But again, bad guys aren't stupid.

25:44.089 --> 25:45.889
Baxter took one look
at that thing in the air

25:45.891 --> 25:47.424
and figured out the
fastest way to lose it.

25:47.426 --> 25:48.491
So what are you saying?

25:48.493 --> 25:49.693
We're supposed to give up?

25:49.695 --> 25:51.094
No, my point is this:

25:51.096 --> 25:55.165
you can't underestimate the
bad guys in this job. Ever.

26:02.174 --> 26:03.273
Why are we stopped?

26:03.275 --> 26:04.407
It's my house.

26:04.409 --> 26:06.242
Figured if we're gonna
be working together,

26:06.244 --> 26:08.078
we might as well get to know each other.

26:08.080 --> 26:10.113
I'll buy you dinner.

26:10.115 --> 26:12.916
You have to pay for
dinner in your own house?

26:14.254 --> 26:16.319
Oh, my...

26:17.723 --> 26:20.123
- Want some more?
- Oh, I'm fine.

26:20.125 --> 26:21.291
Mami, the poor guy's gonna choke.

26:21.293 --> 26:23.393
Cálmate, mijita. Look at him.

26:23.395 --> 26:24.728
He's too skinny.

26:24.730 --> 26:27.797
So, where are you from?

26:27.799 --> 26:29.299
Evanston.

26:29.301 --> 26:30.700
I grew up in Evanston.

26:30.702 --> 26:33.640
You still have family there?

26:33.643 --> 26:34.960
Uh, not really.

26:34.963 --> 26:36.773
Sort of, my father still lives up there.

26:36.775 --> 26:40.744
I left home when I was
16 to go to MIT, so...

26:40.746 --> 26:42.011
we're not close.

26:43.215 --> 26:45.882
Theresa says you're a genius.

26:45.885 --> 26:47.717
Making rockets, robots...

26:47.719 --> 26:49.319
Mom, you're gonna embarrass him.

26:49.321 --> 26:51.721
ÿQué? You said it.

26:51.723 --> 26:53.289
Mateo here...

26:53.291 --> 26:55.825
he gets straight As.

26:55.827 --> 26:57.227
The school says he's gifted.

26:58.742 --> 27:00.875
Hey, maybe he should go work for you.

27:00.878 --> 27:02.732
Straight As, huh? Mateo,

27:02.734 --> 27:04.734
what's your favorite subject?

27:04.736 --> 27:06.002
Math, I guess.

27:06.004 --> 27:07.237
That's the right answer.

27:07.239 --> 27:08.505
I'm an engineer.

27:08.507 --> 27:09.806
You know what that is?

27:09.808 --> 27:11.441
No, what is it?

27:11.443 --> 27:13.343
An engineer is like a superhero,

27:13.345 --> 27:14.911
but better, because he's real.

27:14.913 --> 27:16.946
An engineer builds stuff.

27:16.948 --> 27:18.381
What'd you make there?

27:18.383 --> 27:20.250
It's a track for cars and motorcycles.

27:20.252 --> 27:21.351
Oh, yeah?

27:21.353 --> 27:22.652
- Both of 'em?
- Uh-huh.

27:22.654 --> 27:24.187
There's, like, teams and they race.

27:24.189 --> 27:27.624
The motorcycles always
win, 'cause they're awesome.

27:28.683 --> 27:32.128
They can go super
fast and go down alleys

27:32.130 --> 27:33.696
that cars can't drive in.

27:33.698 --> 27:36.533
This was delicious.
Thank you. I have to go.

27:36.535 --> 27:38.596
But you just got here.

27:38.599 --> 27:40.937
I... have something very important.

27:40.939 --> 27:42.305
Gideon, you don't have a car.

27:42.307 --> 27:45.375
I do, I-I always have a driver on call.

27:45.377 --> 27:49.379
Uh... Mateo...

27:50.435 --> 27:52.482
it's a consulting fee.

27:52.484 --> 27:53.950
Give that to your mom,

27:53.952 --> 27:55.585
have her put it away for college.

27:55.587 --> 27:57.086
Any school but Caltech.

27:57.088 --> 27:58.888
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:00.158 --> 28:01.124
Thank you so much.

28:01.126 --> 28:03.159
- Good night.
- Good night.

28:03.161 --> 28:04.928
I like him.

28:04.930 --> 28:06.696
Mami, please don't.

28:13.952 --> 28:15.972
Yep, housing fits great back here.

28:15.974 --> 28:17.440
Well, the housing was never the issue.

28:17.442 --> 28:19.108
It just needs to deploy cleanly.

28:19.110 --> 28:20.577
All right.

28:20.579 --> 28:21.845
Hey, could you... I can't...

28:21.847 --> 28:23.546
I can't get the angle.

28:25.684 --> 28:27.350
So this is why you ran off

28:27.352 --> 28:28.351
in such a hurry last night?

28:28.353 --> 28:30.253
Um, yeah, pretty much.

28:30.255 --> 28:32.555
I had the basic vehicle,

28:32.557 --> 28:34.624
but just making a few modifications,

28:34.626 --> 28:36.326
since I went over the design parameters

28:36.328 --> 28:37.760
that you laid out last night.

28:37.762 --> 28:40.129
Design parameters?

28:40.131 --> 28:41.907
I'm sorry, am I missing something?

28:41.910 --> 28:44.000
Your lecture on the
finer points of car chases

28:44.002 --> 28:47.270
and your son's ideas about motorcycles.

28:47.272 --> 28:49.038
These bikes

28:49.040 --> 28:51.741
ought to take care of our alley

28:51.743 --> 28:53.176
and pedestrian problems.

28:53.178 --> 28:54.819
Yeah, well, I was out on
the streets all morning,

28:54.821 --> 28:56.311
asking around about Baxter.

28:56.314 --> 28:59.082
Word is, he gets off on us chasing him.

28:59.084 --> 29:00.550
He wants to make another score.

29:00.552 --> 29:02.385
Think these are gonna be ready in time?

29:02.387 --> 29:03.887
We want in.

29:03.889 --> 29:05.655
What? Excuse me?

29:05.657 --> 29:08.191
Ada told me upstairs
what you're working on.

29:08.193 --> 29:10.360
The bikes. Me and
Goss, we're riding 'em.

29:10.362 --> 29:12.362
I told him he can't just
walk his ass up in here

29:12.364 --> 29:14.197
- and interrupt...
- I rode with the Rangers.

29:14.199 --> 29:16.099
Goss was detailed to the motorcycle unit

29:16.101 --> 29:17.567
before she was assigned here.

29:17.569 --> 29:18.735
Whatever we got to do,

29:18.737 --> 29:21.037
we'll do it.

29:21.039 --> 29:23.125
That bastard almost killed Zingo.

29:23.128 --> 29:25.341
Yes, and a little girl.

29:25.343 --> 29:26.643
Yeah, and a little girl.

29:26.645 --> 29:28.878
So if there's a slim chance
in hell of catching this guy

29:28.880 --> 29:30.346
with some new thing that you got?

29:30.348 --> 29:32.015
I'm first in line.

29:37.185 --> 29:40.556
Well, looks like we got our riders.

29:44.154 --> 29:46.822
All right, everybody,
here's the situation:

29:46.825 --> 29:49.060
word on the street is another pharmacy's

29:49.063 --> 29:50.909
gonna get hit in the next few days.

29:50.911 --> 29:53.278
Our job is to be there when Baxter is.

29:53.280 --> 29:54.780
He's fast, he's smart,

29:54.782 --> 29:56.381
and he's not gonna wait
for us to get there.

29:56.383 --> 29:59.685
We're gonna have to spread
out, set a perimeter.

29:59.687 --> 30:01.537
Are you sure you want to do that?

30:01.540 --> 30:03.021
Why?

30:03.023 --> 30:05.591
I just figured you'd want
an optimization algorithm.

30:05.593 --> 30:07.126
A what?

30:07.128 --> 30:09.394
Hey, if you set up a perimeter,

30:09.396 --> 30:10.829
nobody's moving and they're far

30:10.831 --> 30:12.264
from most of the possible targets.

30:12.266 --> 30:13.732
But with the right algorithm,

30:13.734 --> 30:16.135
you can work it out so the
patrol cars are always moving,

30:16.137 --> 30:17.817
and they're always
close to every pharmacy.

30:19.867 --> 30:22.374
- And you can do that?
- Duh.

30:22.376 --> 30:24.476
Okay, new plan. You're
gonna get out there,

30:24.478 --> 30:26.945
Ada's gonna give us
an optimization thing.

30:27.948 --> 30:29.381
Let's go.

30:32.166 --> 30:35.154
Squad 1333. All clear.

30:37.821 --> 30:39.158
Squad 1387.

30:39.160 --> 30:40.826
All clear.

30:40.828 --> 30:43.061
Squad 1391. All clear.

30:45.432 --> 30:47.232
We enhanced the torque on the engines.

30:47.234 --> 30:48.867
So when you guys accelerate,

30:48.869 --> 30:50.202
you're gonna want to hang on.

30:50.204 --> 30:52.371
Enhanced? How much we talking?

30:52.373 --> 30:54.439
Got about 350 foot-pounds.

30:54.441 --> 30:56.575
Zero to 60 in two seconds.

30:56.577 --> 30:58.877
You're basically gonna be the
fastest things on the road.

30:58.879 --> 31:01.013
All right.

31:01.015 --> 31:04.817
So, uh, what happens when
we catch up to the guy?

31:04.819 --> 31:07.983
The idea is to deploy a spike strip.

31:07.986 --> 31:09.997
That's what I'm working on right now.

31:12.426 --> 31:13.592
Hey, uh...

31:13.594 --> 31:15.661
I know this may sound weird, but, um,

31:15.663 --> 31:17.429
have I seen you before?

31:17.431 --> 31:20.032
You follow wrestling?

31:21.302 --> 31:24.336
Holy hell... you're Blockhead.

31:24.338 --> 31:26.738
I'm sorry, who?

31:26.740 --> 31:27.940
The only pro wrestler

31:27.942 --> 31:29.741
to get the U.S., intercontinental

31:29.743 --> 31:31.877
and the tag team belt at the same time.

31:31.879 --> 31:33.579
Welcome to the Block Party.

31:34.515 --> 31:35.981
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

31:35.983 --> 31:37.850
After a career breaking chairs

31:37.852 --> 31:39.651
over people's heads,

31:39.653 --> 31:42.221
Pete got a PhD in electrical engineering

31:42.223 --> 31:44.489
from Georgia Tech, came to work for me.

31:48.796 --> 31:50.529
- You okay?
- Yeah.

31:51.632 --> 31:54.166
Just working out the kinks.

31:54.168 --> 31:55.801
Thanks, man.

31:55.803 --> 31:57.102
Yes, sir.

31:58.672 --> 32:00.873
Captain.

32:00.875 --> 32:02.474
Conrad, that's you.

32:02.476 --> 32:04.309
You're the captain.

32:04.311 --> 32:05.611
Remember?

32:07.281 --> 32:09.414
Still getting used to it.

32:17.091 --> 32:20.125
Weissman, Gioia. Get
these boxes out of here.

32:20.127 --> 32:22.294
Yes, sir. Coming, Cap.

32:26.367 --> 32:27.332
You okay?

32:27.334 --> 32:29.568
Huh? Yeah, no, I...

32:29.570 --> 32:31.770
hit a little snag with
the motorcycle project.

32:31.772 --> 32:33.605
It's fine. I thought you
were going out on patrol.

32:33.607 --> 32:36.174
Yeah. I just... I wanted to
talk to you about something.

32:36.176 --> 32:37.542
What's that?

32:37.544 --> 32:39.945
Look, I know seeing a
little girl get run down,

32:39.947 --> 32:41.246
it hit you hard.

32:41.248 --> 32:43.515
And I know how much
this case means to you.

32:43.517 --> 32:46.018
So I just wanted to say,
if-if you change your mind

32:46.020 --> 32:48.053
and you want another,
more experienced detective

32:48.055 --> 32:51.089
to lead the case... I understand.

32:53.694 --> 32:55.060
Yeah.

32:55.062 --> 32:58.563
Listen, I'm... I'm pretty
green at this job, myself,

32:58.565 --> 33:00.999
so, you know, if you want
to find another billionaire

33:01.001 --> 33:04.269
to buy the police district,
I would understand.

33:05.372 --> 33:07.272
I don't know any other billionaires.

33:07.274 --> 33:09.069
I don't really know
any other detectives,

33:09.072 --> 33:11.143
so...

33:11.145 --> 33:13.078
I guess we're stuck
with each other. Okay.

33:13.080 --> 33:16.415
Get out there. Go get
the bad guys. Scumbags...

33:16.417 --> 33:17.983
I don't know. What is it? Crooks, perps,

33:17.985 --> 33:19.584
whatever phrasing inspires you

33:19.586 --> 33:23.021
to, like, do the most justice.

33:24.325 --> 33:25.924
I mean, it's really
not that complicated.

33:25.926 --> 33:28.427
I'm just partitioning the area
with a distributed algorithm.

33:28.429 --> 33:29.795
Now, see there?

33:29.797 --> 33:31.697
You just lost me again.

33:31.699 --> 33:34.066
Okay, uh... Think about it, like, um...

33:34.068 --> 33:35.867
Like, you know, the ghosts in Pac-Man.

33:35.869 --> 33:37.436
It'd be a lot easier to catch them

33:37.438 --> 33:39.438
if they just stood still, right?

33:39.440 --> 33:42.074
Do I look like I play video games?

33:44.645 --> 33:46.578
Okay. "Guy with a gun at Freeman Drug."

33:46.580 --> 33:47.546
That's him.

33:47.548 --> 33:48.547
All units,

33:48.549 --> 33:50.215
pharmacy robbery in Lakeview.

33:50.217 --> 33:53.218
Suspect headed southbound on
Lincoln between 8th and 9th.

33:53.220 --> 33:55.087
1099. 1309 responding.

33:55.089 --> 33:56.488
How are those bikes coming?

33:56.490 --> 33:58.211
Officers, I can't let you do this.

33:58.214 --> 33:59.958
You haven't even taken them out, yet.

33:59.960 --> 34:01.660
Well, this party's started,
and I'm not missing it.

34:01.662 --> 34:03.028
Yeah. We'll figure it out.

34:03.030 --> 34:05.163
The spike strips, they gonna work?

34:05.165 --> 34:06.565
The bikes are wired,

34:06.567 --> 34:08.632
but unless you have eyes
on the back of your head,

34:08.635 --> 34:10.202
you're gonna have a
real hard time targeting.

34:10.204 --> 34:12.270
You got three minutes to figure it out.

34:25.002 --> 34:27.235
1309. Squad, I'm in pursuit,

34:27.237 --> 34:28.337
requesting backup.

34:28.339 --> 34:30.873
Help is on the way, 1309.

34:30.875 --> 34:33.509
All right. What's the
ETA on Goss and Brandt?

34:34.451 --> 34:36.545
One minute, eight seconds
at current velocity.

34:36.547 --> 34:38.214
Whoa.

34:38.216 --> 34:40.049
How fast are those things going?

34:40.051 --> 34:42.685
Faster than I could
answer that question.

34:50.527 --> 34:52.033
Are you kidding me?!

34:53.906 --> 34:55.563
Brandt, I need you to get ahead of him.

34:55.565 --> 34:57.166
About eight blocks up, there's an alley.

34:57.168 --> 34:59.902
Goss, you take 14th and intercept.

34:59.904 --> 35:01.103
Copy, squad.

35:01.105 --> 35:02.504
Copy that, squad.

35:24.428 --> 35:26.016
Ada, I need to see the road.

35:26.019 --> 35:27.621
Get me a rear view from Brandt's bike.

35:27.624 --> 35:29.591
Nope. That's all I got.

35:30.334 --> 35:31.734
There's no rear view camera?

35:31.736 --> 35:33.269
They are experimental bikes,

35:33.271 --> 35:35.437
they were in a lab 11
hours ago, I told you

35:35.439 --> 35:36.472
they weren't ready.

35:36.474 --> 35:38.607
Brandt? I want you to
do something for me.

35:38.609 --> 35:39.808
Little busy, right now.

35:39.810 --> 35:40.910
It's very important.

35:40.912 --> 35:42.611
I want you to take your body camera,

35:42.613 --> 35:44.179
pull it around behind you,

35:44.181 --> 35:45.714
like, as low as you can get.

35:45.716 --> 35:47.950
You want me to wear my camera on my ass?

35:47.952 --> 35:50.352
Lower back is... is fine.

35:54.792 --> 35:57.526
Yes! That is perfect.

36:03.607 --> 36:04.984
All right, he's almost there.

36:04.987 --> 36:06.587
What about Goss?

36:06.590 --> 36:07.789
Closing in.

36:07.792 --> 36:09.071
Hey, Murphy,

36:09.073 --> 36:11.714
you want to know why I'm not
asking you if you're ready?

36:11.717 --> 36:12.950
Why's that?

36:12.952 --> 36:15.052
'Cause I know the answer already.

36:18.490 --> 36:20.257
Goss? Brandt?

36:20.260 --> 36:21.926
Both of you, listen to me carefully.

36:21.929 --> 36:25.330
You're gonna see a red
button on your handlebars.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.001
I'm gonna need you moving
laterally across the road

36:31.003 --> 36:33.304
in front of the car, and
you're gonna hit that button

36:33.306 --> 36:35.172
on my signal. On one.

36:35.174 --> 36:36.206
Ready?

36:36.208 --> 36:37.665
Five...

36:39.078 --> 36:40.778
four...

36:43.261 --> 36:44.960
three,

36:44.963 --> 36:46.830
two...

36:47.883 --> 36:49.350
One!

37:03.803 --> 37:05.836
Chicago Police! Freeze!

37:17.149 --> 37:19.883
- Yeah!
- Yes!

37:19.885 --> 37:21.485
You like that? Huh?

37:21.487 --> 37:22.920
- You like that?
- Stand down.

37:22.922 --> 37:25.055
Stand down! Stand down.

37:25.476 --> 37:26.842
That's for Zingo.

37:28.066 --> 37:29.633
Suspect in custody.

37:29.636 --> 37:30.668
Yes!

37:30.671 --> 37:32.571
Oh, oh, oh!

37:32.574 --> 37:34.007
We got him.

37:34.010 --> 37:36.277
Not bad for a first case, Detective.

37:45.845 --> 37:47.678
That thing is absurd.

37:47.680 --> 37:49.747
Well, you're not the one carrying it.

37:49.749 --> 37:51.081
So how is she?

37:51.083 --> 37:53.550
Doctors said she woke up last night.

37:53.552 --> 37:55.586
I thought they said she
wouldn't be conscious

37:55.588 --> 37:56.620
for at least a week.

37:56.622 --> 37:58.922
Yeah. Well, I hired new doctors.

38:00.059 --> 38:02.059
All right, okay...

38:04.630 --> 38:05.896
Hello.

38:07.266 --> 38:08.565
Detective.

38:09.769 --> 38:10.934
Mr. Reeves.

38:10.936 --> 38:12.469
Oh, uh, Gideon,

38:12.471 --> 38:13.871
please, please.

38:13.874 --> 38:16.496
Uh, I don't know if you've
been watching the news.

38:16.499 --> 38:18.275
I have.

38:18.277 --> 38:20.244
Nice work.

38:20.246 --> 38:21.578
Well...

38:23.149 --> 38:24.948
... I had some help.

38:24.950 --> 38:27.618
Is she... ?

38:28.554 --> 38:31.021
Baby? Hey.

38:31.023 --> 38:33.457
Some people are here to see you.

38:35.261 --> 38:36.760
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

38:36.762 --> 38:39.029
I'm Gideon. Uh... I brought you this.

38:39.031 --> 38:41.131
Get it right up here. There we go.

38:41.133 --> 38:42.933
Look.

38:42.935 --> 38:46.036
I... I asked for the
biggest that they had.

38:46.038 --> 38:48.238
I wasn't aware of the latest advances

38:48.240 --> 38:50.441
in teddy bear-making
technologies, so...

38:51.510 --> 38:52.609
It's okay.

38:52.611 --> 38:54.211
I really like it.

38:54.213 --> 38:56.513
Oh. Oh, yeah? All right. Good.

38:56.515 --> 38:57.781
Uh, we have to go.

38:57.783 --> 39:00.851
But I did want to say one thing. Um...

39:00.853 --> 39:03.353
I can do a lot of things...

39:03.355 --> 39:05.656
Make robots, drones,

39:05.658 --> 39:07.724
turn carbon into nanotubes...

39:07.726 --> 39:08.559
Gideon.

39:08.561 --> 39:10.194
Right. But, uh...

39:11.330 --> 39:14.798
One thing that I can't do

39:14.800 --> 39:18.302
is promise nothing like
this will ever happen again.

39:20.724 --> 39:22.539
But I am trying.

39:22.541 --> 39:23.507
I know.

39:23.509 --> 39:25.024
Thank you.

39:25.027 --> 39:26.094
Thank you.

39:26.097 --> 39:27.978
Thank you.

39:30.683 --> 39:32.015
That's gonna help out a lot.

39:32.017 --> 39:34.351
Yeah. Let's run it by the captain.

39:34.353 --> 39:36.320
Hey.

39:36.322 --> 39:38.121
You okay, there?

39:38.123 --> 39:39.923
No.

39:39.925 --> 39:41.959
I went to the vet's office at lunch.

39:41.961 --> 39:44.094
I checked the cages out back.

39:44.096 --> 39:45.362
Zingo wasn't there.

39:46.332 --> 39:47.898
- Listen, Brandt.
- Yeah.

39:47.900 --> 39:50.767
Just because the dog
wasn't in the cage...

39:52.705 --> 39:54.638
Zingo.

39:54.640 --> 39:56.088
Hey.

39:56.091 --> 39:58.942
Hey, boy! Hey, come here, boy.

40:00.746 --> 40:02.312
Hey, boy!

40:03.415 --> 40:04.882
How did you do this?

40:04.884 --> 40:07.084
Reeves has a medical division,

40:07.086 --> 40:09.186
and most of the device
prototypes are for animals,

40:09.188 --> 40:12.411
and... you know, it was lying around.

40:12.414 --> 40:14.725
Oh, I was there. He stole it.

40:15.828 --> 40:16.827
Wow. Thank you.

40:16.829 --> 40:17.690
So, um,

40:17.693 --> 40:18.996
what happens to him now?

40:18.998 --> 40:20.497
Well, to be honest,

40:20.499 --> 40:23.200
keeping him on the force might
be a bit of an insurance issue.

40:23.202 --> 40:25.269
So, uh, your partner

40:25.271 --> 40:28.105
said you, uh... might want a dog.

40:30.943 --> 40:32.376
Did you hear that, boy?

40:32.378 --> 40:34.311
Oh, it's you and me now.

40:49.828 --> 40:51.495
- Hi.
- Hi, papi.

40:51.497 --> 40:53.163
- You have fun at your dad's? Mwah.
- Yeah!

40:53.165 --> 40:54.197
Yeah?

40:54.199 --> 40:55.299
- Missed you.
- You, too.

40:55.301 --> 40:57.467
- Go wait in the car.
- Okay.

40:57.469 --> 41:00.037
So I tried calling you
a couple times today.

41:00.039 --> 41:02.339
Sorry. I've just... I've been jammed.

41:02.341 --> 41:04.274
Listen, I'm gonna pick him up
from soccer on Tuesday, okay?

41:04.276 --> 41:07.844
I know. So listen, that
transfer we discussed.

41:07.846 --> 41:09.613
I think you should do it.

41:09.615 --> 41:12.215
In fact,

41:12.951 --> 41:14.550
Already had the paperwork drawn up.

41:14.553 --> 41:16.588
Scott, I already told you.
I'm not leaving the 13th.

41:16.590 --> 41:17.655
Why not?

41:17.658 --> 41:19.092
Oh, because Reeves made you a detective?

41:19.094 --> 41:20.227
It's not just that.

41:20.230 --> 41:22.391
But yeah. That has
something to do with it.

41:22.394 --> 41:23.660
You know, it seems a little weird to me,

41:23.662 --> 41:25.095
that the guy's been
there less than a week,

41:25.097 --> 41:26.763
and he's already given you a promotion.

41:26.765 --> 41:28.398
What are you trying to say?

41:28.400 --> 41:29.533
It's just an observation.

41:29.535 --> 41:30.634
Guess he's a big fan of your work.

41:30.636 --> 41:31.969
Is that why you called me?

41:31.971 --> 41:33.470
'Cause you're jealous of my boss?

41:33.472 --> 41:35.005
- No.
- You know what?

41:35.007 --> 41:36.440
I don't have time for this.

41:36.442 --> 41:37.908
Actually, Theresa,

41:37.910 --> 41:40.811
the reason I called was
to give you a heads-up.

41:40.813 --> 41:42.713
The mayor has set up a task force

41:42.715 --> 41:44.514
to look into the 13th District.

41:44.516 --> 41:47.217
It seems not everybody
loves the idea of a rich guy

41:47.219 --> 41:48.752
shooting people with drones,

41:48.754 --> 41:51.221
or turning citizens into amateur cops.

41:52.058 --> 41:53.757
So I'd get out while you can.

41:58.030 --> 42:00.063
Oh, there's one more thing.

42:00.065 --> 42:02.232
I'm the head of the task force.
