CJ ENTERTAINMENT PRESENTS

00:59.659 --> 01:03.971
AN ECHO FILM /CJ ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTION

02:11.831 --> 02:19.682
BROKEN

02:41.561 --> 02:42.733
Su-jin

02:43.897 --> 02:45.308
Go to bed, honey

02:47.000 --> 02:51.506
What are you doing with
TV and all the lights on?

02:52.739 --> 02:54.446
Did you drink?

02:55.675 --> 02:56.653
Yeah

02:59.345 --> 03:01.689
We were gonna go
grocery shopping together

03:02.482 --> 03:04.716
You forgot again?

03:04.717 --> 03:06.560
I had to do overtime

03:07.887 --> 03:12.893
You could've called
You're always like this

03:42.188 --> 03:43.667
I'm off to school

03:46.459 --> 03:47.665
What about breakfast?

03:48.761 --> 03:50.934
- Eat your breakfast
- Later

04:04.477 --> 04:07.788
Look here
It's all coming out right

04:09.716 --> 04:10.716
Why did it stop?

04:10.717 --> 04:12.217
So what's the problem?

04:12.218 --> 04:16.421
We've been overworking
the machines lately

04:16.422 --> 04:21.422
They have to be ready
to ship out by next week

04:21.461 --> 04:22.561
I'm sorry

04:22.562 --> 04:27.562
You may not need this job
but I do. Is that clear?

04:28.835 --> 04:30.002
Yes, sir

04:30.003 --> 04:31.870
Get production up to 90%
by the end of the week

04:31.871 --> 04:34.909
Don't think about
going home until then

04:37.710 --> 04:42.347
But we've been telling them
the machines need checking

04:42.348 --> 04:44.182
Why didn't you say something?

04:44.183 --> 04:46.718
What could I tell him?
He's in a tight spot, too

04:46.719 --> 04:50.856
Man, you have a heart of gold

04:50.857 --> 04:55.101
That's your problem

05:01.934 --> 05:03.709
Okay, bye

05:39.839 --> 05:42.908
Working late tonight

05:42.909 --> 05:44.242
What have you got there?

05:44.243 --> 05:46.018
- Don't look
- Is that your daughter?

05:47.680 --> 05:49.414
Give her space

05:49.415 --> 05:52.658
Kids hate their parents
breathing down their necks

05:53.486 --> 05:58.993
My daughter doesn't look at me
except when she needs money

06:13.139 --> 06:14.379
No

06:15.575 --> 06:16.918
I said no

06:18.277 --> 06:20.188
What's the matter with you?

06:22.148 --> 06:23.957
You don't want it?

06:42.135 --> 06:43.170
Su-jin

06:46.939 --> 06:48.941
I got some night snack

06:50.710 --> 06:51.780
Are you asleep?

06:53.312 --> 06:54.552
Su-jin

06:57.316 --> 06:58.795
Come and have a bite

07:01.654 --> 07:02.724
Su-jin?

07:31.717 --> 07:35.454
The number you're calling
is switched off

07:35.455 --> 07:37.435
Please leave a message after the tone

07:55.007 --> 07:57.351
Enjoying your burger?

07:59.946 --> 08:04.946
So, there was no use
of excessive force

08:07.720 --> 08:09.529
or profanity during
the interrogation?

08:10.990 --> 08:13.758
Do you have to harass me
at this hour?

08:13.759 --> 08:18.759
Not if you cooperated when
we asked you nicely, shithead!

08:19.131 --> 08:24.131
Scumbags like you never change
You should rot in jail forever

08:24.904 --> 08:27.009
You lowly piece of shit...

08:29.742 --> 08:34.741
...I quote from the affidavit
But you never said any of these

08:35.114 --> 08:37.381
I said I'm sorry

08:37.383 --> 08:41.318
Don't you have a nephew of his age?

08:41.320 --> 08:45.557
That boy was a straight "A" student

08:45.558 --> 08:47.265
As the direct result of

08:49.061 --> 08:53.840
gross misconduct by police,
the boy is undergoing psychotherapy

09:07.914 --> 09:09.393
Long time!

09:10.750 --> 09:11.820
Hey

09:12.385 --> 09:14.753
You're on duty again?

09:14.754 --> 09:16.054
Can I have a sip?

09:16.055 --> 09:18.223
- Go home time to time
- What for?

09:18.224 --> 09:22.761
I feel sorry for your partner
Does he have time for dates?

09:22.762 --> 09:24.362
Pardon?

09:24.363 --> 09:27.537
Never mind
Go on in

09:28.768 --> 09:30.475
I hear you're in trouble again?

09:31.203 --> 09:33.371
Who told you that?

09:33.372 --> 09:35.974
The boy is getting psychotherapy?

09:35.975 --> 09:37.409
Take things easy, will you?

09:37.410 --> 09:38.753
Let's get to work

09:40.546 --> 09:42.714
The owner abandoned it
after going bankrupt

09:42.715 --> 09:47.352
Now it's a hangout
for the local delinquents

09:47.353 --> 09:50.994
They timeshared the place, apparently

09:51.891 --> 09:53.234
Is that messed up or what?

09:55.127 --> 09:56.333
Is it not?

10:02.001 --> 10:03.802
Call the forensics team

10:03.803 --> 10:04.703
Yes, sir

10:04.704 --> 10:07.205
Go around door-to-door
Find out about the boys

10:07.206 --> 10:08.344
Ouch

10:09.775 --> 10:11.015
I'm sorry

10:12.111 --> 10:14.921
He still acts like a newbie

10:15.448 --> 10:17.182
Still trying to save the planet?

10:17.183 --> 10:19.184
They're all like that at first

10:19.185 --> 10:20.186
This way

10:21.587 --> 10:25.624
They discovered the body
during an inspection

10:25.625 --> 10:29.937
Felt something mushy when
they tried to move a trash bag

10:31.097 --> 10:34.943
They suspect she was
assaulted and raped

10:36.002 --> 10:39.643
What's happening to the world?

10:42.908 --> 10:44.649
Bastards...

10:46.979 --> 10:48.113
Did you check the oil?

10:48.114 --> 10:49.092
Sorry?

10:50.449 --> 10:55.449
It's not the oil
and you know that

10:56.389 --> 10:59.891
We're sweating our asses off here

10:59.892 --> 11:02.236
Hello?
Is that you, Su-jin?

11:03.295 --> 11:04.399
Sorry?

11:05.665 --> 11:09.334
Hang on a second

11:09.335 --> 11:10.370
Hey

11:11.137 --> 11:14.710
Yes...that's right

11:16.275 --> 11:17.413
Yeah

11:21.681 --> 11:25.151
I'm sorry but you've got
the wrong number

11:27.887 --> 11:31.164
What the hell is
he talking about?

11:36.662 --> 11:39.431
I only came because you
wouldn't stop pestering me

11:39.432 --> 11:41.969
But you're seriously mistaken

11:43.803 --> 11:48.673
Things are crazy at work
We've got a quota to meet

11:48.674 --> 11:51.676
I'm sure my daughter is
with one of her friends

11:51.677 --> 11:53.211
We just need an identification

11:53.212 --> 11:55.647
What are you talking about?

11:55.648 --> 11:57.491
- It'll only take a minute
- Don't touch me

12:01.420 --> 12:06.631
Why would I ID a body
that I don't know?

12:08.627 --> 12:10.629
It is your daughter

13:30.743 --> 13:34.913
Find out everything about her
Friends, reputation, school records...

13:34.914 --> 13:38.883
Her father said she never ran away
She seemed like a good girl

13:38.884 --> 13:40.955
All parents say that

13:45.691 --> 13:50.161
Case known as
'Bathhouse Murder'

13:50.162 --> 13:53.439
Date of incident,
December 12

13:55.601 --> 13:56.636
Sir

13:57.670 --> 14:01.739
There was a car circling the area
with the hazard light on

14:01.740 --> 14:04.342
A black 'Prince' sedan

14:04.343 --> 14:06.544
Around the same time
Su-jin went missing

14:06.545 --> 14:07.523
A Prince?

14:08.614 --> 14:11.686
A local auto-mechanic noticed it
because it was such an old car

14:21.260 --> 14:22.534
What about breakfast?

14:23.596 --> 14:25.473
Su-jin, eat your breakfast

14:40.346 --> 14:44.716
It appears that they kidnapped
Lee Su-jin and drugged her

14:44.717 --> 14:49.462
When she died during rape
they abandoned her body and ran

15:25.824 --> 15:29.894
Your being here
doesn't help the case

15:29.895 --> 15:31.670
Go home and rest

15:32.364 --> 15:37.040
Working late. I'll get snacks
on the way home

15:51.684 --> 15:53.527
It's freezing, isn't it?

15:54.653 --> 15:58.690
There are cops everywhere
Something happened?

15:58.691 --> 16:02.160
Didn’t you hear?
The old bathhouse building...

16:02.161 --> 16:04.462
A middle school girl
was found murdered

16:04.463 --> 16:05.697
What?

16:05.698 --> 16:09.334
Not only murdered
but raped, too

16:09.335 --> 16:10.735
The poor little thing

16:10.736 --> 16:15.736
Scumbags like them don't deserve trial
They should be sent straight to death row

16:16.508 --> 16:19.010
It gave me goose bumps
just hearing the story

16:19.011 --> 16:21.512
Aren't you going to
the evening class?

16:21.513 --> 16:24.315
That little bastard won't
say hello to his father?

16:24.316 --> 16:26.887
Don't call him that

16:37.529 --> 16:39.697
Looking for eye witness

16:39.698 --> 16:41.699
Yo, Du-sik!

16:41.700 --> 16:43.701
See the one with a red scarf?

16:43.702 --> 16:46.704
Come on, I want to see her face

16:46.705 --> 16:48.406
She's only a kid

16:48.407 --> 16:49.874
She's old enough

16:49.875 --> 16:53.411
Shit, she's heavy

16:53.412 --> 16:54.645
Stop moving!

16:54.646 --> 16:57.024
Don’t spit it out, bitch!

17:13.866 --> 17:15.709
You've been avoiding us

17:16.734 --> 17:19.604
It was an accident

17:19.605 --> 17:22.272
Thinking about going
behind our backs?

17:22.273 --> 17:24.742
You were in it together, douchebag

17:24.742 --> 17:26.077
But I didn't do anything

17:26.078 --> 17:28.146
Fuck, right!
Who's gonna believe you?

17:28.146 --> 17:31.685
I'll hold it up to the end
that you're an accomplice

17:35.387 --> 17:37.422
You, chicken shit

17:37.423 --> 17:41.726
Come on, they're not CSI

17:41.727 --> 17:45.329
They won't find us
We've done it so many times

17:45.330 --> 17:46.697
But, still...

17:46.698 --> 17:48.699
someone died

17:48.700 --> 17:50.568
For fuck's sake!

17:50.569 --> 17:51.673
Stop

17:53.605 --> 17:55.706
Stop it

17:55.707 --> 17:57.475
What if the cops ask?

17:57.476 --> 18:01.245
Just tell them you know nothing

18:01.246 --> 18:03.658
You'll be fine as long
you don't confess

18:04.616 --> 18:08.619
If the cops ask, tell them
you dropped us off

18:08.620 --> 18:09.987
That you went for a drive
on your own

18:09.988 --> 18:12.798
There's no evidence that
we were in that car with you

18:56.835 --> 18:59.270
If you found this,
call 011 3143 2536

18:59.271 --> 19:01.217
My dad's real scary

19:13.852 --> 19:15.729
You were still here?

19:27.332 --> 19:29.073
Go home, it's cold out

19:32.538 --> 19:34.211
We'll catch the bastards

19:45.584 --> 19:47.120
My wife

19:50.722 --> 19:52.724
She was sick for a long time

19:57.596 --> 19:59.667
After she was diagnosed with cancer

20:02.868 --> 20:04.711
she suffered for three years

20:08.674 --> 20:10.847
Then she left us

20:16.582 --> 20:18.755
I was in so much pain

20:25.691 --> 20:32.631
I wasn't able to do
anything for Su-jin

20:34.967 --> 20:36.640
Nothing

20:40.505 --> 20:45.147
Go home
That's the best you can do

20:50.048 --> 20:52.153
Is it?

20:58.123 --> 20:59.864
This?

21:04.429 --> 21:07.171
Sitting around, doing nothing

21:10.402 --> 21:16.785
Is that really the best I can do?

21:18.710 --> 21:19.688
Like this?

21:22.848 --> 21:25.419
Like an invalid?

21:35.127 --> 21:36.902
I'm sorry

21:37.729 --> 21:40.972
Please go home and wait

21:56.948 --> 21:58.256
What is it?

22:32.684 --> 22:35.486
Jo Du-sik, Kim Cheol-yong
#202, 587 Cheonho St.

22:35.487 --> 22:37.831
Keys under flower pot
Evidence in striped shoe box

22:40.959 --> 22:44.930
NO PRANK

22:49.668 --> 22:52.444
Sergeant Jang Eok-gwan

25:05.737 --> 25:09.480
Dec 10, Subway middle schooler

25:40.906 --> 25:42.681
Alright, I hear ya

25:43.742 --> 25:47.554
Just worry about yourself, mom

25:50.081 --> 25:52.652
I'll go home in the weekend

25:54.052 --> 25:55.497
Gotta go

25:59.257 --> 26:02.238
What's up?
Yeah, I'm getting the money

26:03.495 --> 26:04.803
150 dollars

26:05.564 --> 26:08.170
I don't know...
I'll lie low for a week

26:09.734 --> 26:12.010
I'll watch it once and delete it

26:14.039 --> 26:16.883
I said I'll get rid of it

26:18.143 --> 26:19.476
You fucking whore!

26:19.477 --> 26:21.821
What...you scared?

26:24.349 --> 26:26.989
No, I'm just playing with you

26:28.253 --> 26:29.994
I'm kidding

26:34.259 --> 26:37.595
It's my birthday
I get to go first

26:37.596 --> 26:38.973
Whatever

26:43.802 --> 26:47.004
Dang, she's yummy

26:47.005 --> 26:49.039
I think I'll pass this one

26:49.040 --> 26:50.441
Why?

26:50.442 --> 26:52.683
Just do it
It's your birthday

26:53.678 --> 26:55.980
Stay still, bitch!

26:55.981 --> 27:01.158
Shit! She pinched me

27:07.459 --> 27:09.493
Hold still, bitch
and shut the fuck up

27:09.494 --> 27:11.337
Do you know how much to use?

27:13.231 --> 27:14.710
Do you or not?

27:20.905 --> 27:22.272
What's wrong with her?

27:22.273 --> 27:26.244
Hey, hey!

27:27.445 --> 27:28.879
Shit...how much did you give her?

27:28.880 --> 27:31.048
I don't know, man
You told me to do it

27:31.049 --> 27:32.549
Is she...dead?

27:32.550 --> 27:34.325
She came around

27:34.719 --> 27:36.221
Dad!

27:37.222 --> 27:38.326
Dad!

27:39.824 --> 27:40.924
Holycow!

27:40.925 --> 27:43.565
Jeez...what the fuck?

27:44.462 --> 27:45.668
Who are you?

27:46.431 --> 27:47.998
I said who the fuck?

27:47.999 --> 27:49.637
How did you get in here?

27:50.135 --> 27:51.443
What the hell?

27:53.705 --> 27:54.838
Why?

27:54.839 --> 27:56.407
Why?

27:56.408 --> 27:57.512
Why?

28:00.145 --> 28:01.123
Why?

28:04.783 --> 28:05.749
Why'd you do that?

28:05.750 --> 28:07.785
Shit

28:07.786 --> 28:09.553
Why did you do that?

28:09.554 --> 28:10.554
Fuck...

28:10.555 --> 28:11.321
Why did you do that?

28:11.322 --> 28:12.733
Why did you do that?

28:16.961 --> 28:19.441
Don't kill me, please

28:21.733 --> 28:22.733
Why did you do that?

28:22.734 --> 28:24.368
Why...why...

28:24.369 --> 28:25.636
I'm sorry, okay?

28:25.637 --> 28:29.640
I didn't steal it

28:29.641 --> 28:31.985
I swear it wasn't me

28:32.744 --> 28:35.379
I'm telling you the truth, fuck!

28:35.380 --> 28:37.155
What did you say?

28:39.184 --> 28:40.390
Fuck you

28:42.721 --> 28:44.394
You fucking bastard

28:46.725 --> 28:48.826
Why are you doing this?

28:48.827 --> 28:50.329
Why

28:51.429 --> 28:53.102
did you do that

28:53.998 --> 28:56.734
to my daughter?

28:56.735 --> 29:00.376
Why!

29:05.343 --> 29:07.144
Sergeant

29:07.145 --> 29:08.645
What?

29:08.646 --> 29:11.682
Su-jin's cell phone was
switched on last night

29:11.683 --> 29:13.751
We have the location
Let's go

29:13.752 --> 29:15.419
You know what the average
cell tower range is?

29:15.420 --> 29:16.420
You won't find shit

29:16.421 --> 29:17.421
Sir?

29:17.422 --> 29:19.424
The perp may have ditched it

29:20.258 --> 29:22.926
Did you check the subway
surveillance video?

29:22.927 --> 29:24.661
Well...

29:24.662 --> 29:26.835
There was a car
matching the description

29:28.032 --> 29:30.667
but we couldn't make the license plate
because of the drizzly weather

29:30.668 --> 29:32.736
I doubt they used a car

29:32.737 --> 29:35.739
What then...carried her on their back?
On a rainy night?

29:35.740 --> 29:39.309
If they used a car,
we must widen the search area

29:39.310 --> 29:41.311
It was a bunch of kids

29:41.312 --> 29:43.013
Lazy...can't be arsed to do shit

29:43.014 --> 29:44.084
Sergeant Jang

29:44.716 --> 29:48.085
We've got the ID of
the bathhouse perps

29:48.086 --> 29:49.827
One of them is from the neighborhood

30:36.434 --> 30:39.643
Jo Du-sik

30:46.711 --> 30:49.947
Pick up the damn phone
It's 12:10 train

30:49.948 --> 30:51.291
12:10...

31:01.693 --> 31:07.109
- Where are you going?
- Gangnueng. Did you get the money?

31:22.513 --> 31:23.719
Kim Cheol-yong

31:25.350 --> 31:27.091
I don't think
there's anyone home

31:28.486 --> 31:29.521
Kim Cheol-yong

31:45.703 --> 31:46.841
Hey

31:49.073 --> 31:50.340
Kim Cheol-yong

31:50.341 --> 31:51.183
Hey

31:54.212 --> 31:56.920
Gangneung...12:10

31:57.448 --> 31:58.483
Jo Du-sik!

31:58.650 --> 31:59.628
Wait

32:01.352 --> 32:03.662
Just a second

32:04.422 --> 32:05.594
Wait

32:12.830 --> 32:14.332
Jo Du-sik!

32:23.574 --> 32:24.408
Chief

32:24.409 --> 32:25.542
Where is Jang?

32:25.543 --> 32:26.810
He's inside

32:26.811 --> 32:29.646
We dropped by
about the bathhouse murder

32:29.647 --> 32:33.216
You know the iPad burglary
a few months ago

32:33.217 --> 32:34.451
We believe he was connected

32:34.452 --> 32:35.519
I see. Get back to work

32:35.520 --> 32:36.498
Yes, sir

32:37.588 --> 32:41.536
He was a high schooler?
The headquarter's turned upside down

32:43.962 --> 32:45.635
What's the matter with you?

32:46.631 --> 32:50.101
What the hell?

32:52.370 --> 32:53.670
Did you get anything?

32:53.671 --> 32:56.573
The perp wanted to tell the world
that he did it

32:56.574 --> 32:57.607
What do you mean?

32:57.608 --> 32:59.042
He didn't clean up the scene

32:59.043 --> 33:02.546
He didn't bother to clean up at all

33:02.547 --> 33:07.517
There are prints everywhere
He must have taken us for idiots

33:07.518 --> 33:08.752
What do you think?

33:08.753 --> 33:12.656
Out right grudge
What else can it be?

33:12.657 --> 33:15.325
He busted the vic's balls

33:15.326 --> 33:16.727
What are you talking about?

33:16.728 --> 33:18.833
He smashed up the vic's testicles

33:26.904 --> 33:28.705
Who's the other face?

33:28.706 --> 33:33.310
A friend of the vic's
We're looking into it

33:33.311 --> 33:35.655
Are there more videos?

33:36.681 --> 33:41.318
This is the last one
We still gotta check the hard drive

33:41.319 --> 33:45.322
I can see why he ended up
with crushed balls

33:45.323 --> 33:47.667
What's happening to this world?

33:48.593 --> 33:52.429
Our suspect came
without intent to kill

33:52.430 --> 33:55.599
Then he saw the video
and the victim walked in

33:55.600 --> 33:59.069
The suspect must have lost it
Perhaps, one of the victims in the video?

33:59.070 --> 34:00.704
Did you track down the victims?

34:00.705 --> 34:03.340
I gave them a round of calls...

34:03.341 --> 34:06.410
Retard!
You called them on the phone?

34:06.411 --> 34:07.711
Of course, they'll say no

34:07.712 --> 34:10.714
Hey! No one's sitting around
with free time on their hands

34:10.715 --> 34:15.715
Everyone of the victims'
families are suspects

34:15.719 --> 34:17.120
Why don't you go
talk to them yourself?

34:17.121 --> 34:18.690
Stop it

34:22.393 --> 34:25.237
Appoint yourself
the goddamn Chief of Police

34:29.699 --> 34:31.701
What's the matter with you?

34:31.702 --> 34:33.370
What?

34:33.371 --> 34:35.578
I heard the Internal Affairs came by again

34:37.708 --> 34:40.409
Didn't I tell you to lie low for a while?

34:40.411 --> 34:44.347
I managed to talk them down
and you had to poop all over it?

34:44.348 --> 34:45.982
You know the accusation
is absurd

34:45.983 --> 34:49.658
Absurd?
The boy's been institutionalized

34:54.692 --> 35:01.075
The little bastard bashed up
his friend to his last breath

35:01.799 --> 35:04.000
He burned his skin with a lighter

35:04.001 --> 35:05.602
We're not discussing the case here

35:05.603 --> 35:08.105
Then when he came round,
the bastard beat him up

35:08.106 --> 35:09.439
and burned him again

35:09.440 --> 35:11.074
He did that for 3 days before
dumping the body in the garbage

35:11.075 --> 35:12.008
Do you know why?

35:12.009 --> 35:13.743
We all know what happened

35:13.744 --> 35:16.480
I don't give a fuck anymore
if you get suspended

35:16.481 --> 35:17.687
Sergeant Jang

35:19.217 --> 35:25.224
This is Lee Su-jin

35:40.571 --> 35:41.675
Mr. Lee

35:42.273 --> 35:44.685
I think I can open it

35:48.479 --> 35:49.651
Mr. Lee?

35:52.116 --> 35:54.050
His phone is switched off

35:54.051 --> 35:56.987
Let's put him on wanted list

35:56.988 --> 35:59.662
It'll be harder to catch him
once he skips town

36:01.459 --> 36:04.394
Jo turned off his cell
and disappeared

36:04.395 --> 36:08.498
His grandmother wants
nothing to do with him

36:08.499 --> 36:10.934
Just wants him put in jail

36:10.935 --> 36:15.372
Find other victims
and secure witnesses

36:15.373 --> 36:16.443
Thanks

36:17.808 --> 36:19.409
From this moment, Lee is
no longer the victim's family

36:19.410 --> 36:20.710
but a suspect of murder

36:20.711 --> 36:23.613
If Lee killed to avenge his daughter

36:23.614 --> 36:25.215
it puts the other kids in danger

36:25.216 --> 36:27.287
Maybe he already got them

36:30.288 --> 36:31.995
Then, he'd have turned himself in

36:34.759 --> 36:36.568
or killed himself

36:40.097 --> 36:41.838
They found the suspect vehicle

36:50.708 --> 36:55.054
You missed the damn train
Come to Myung Sun Institute

37:05.990 --> 37:08.436
Jo Du-sik, 010...

37:33.084 --> 37:35.785
You were at your dry cleaner's
on the night of 10th?

37:35.786 --> 37:36.953
Yes, probably

37:36.954 --> 37:38.955
How long were you there?

37:38.956 --> 37:40.824
I stay till about 9pm normally

37:40.825 --> 37:43.727
Who else in your family can drive?

37:43.728 --> 37:47.831
Just me...
Why are you asking me?

37:47.832 --> 37:49.607
It's registered under your name, correct?

37:51.235 --> 37:55.741
They'll get their rightful punishment
even as minors, right?

37:56.574 --> 37:58.441
It was a rape-murder, after all

37:58.442 --> 38:02.117
They'll get at least five years

38:04.982 --> 38:07.758
Kids these days are getting
devilishly smarter

38:08.953 --> 38:12.059
They know they only get off
with a slap on the wrist

38:17.728 --> 38:20.971
There is no adult or minor in crime

38:21.866 --> 38:24.540
Only the same filthy criminals

38:29.740 --> 38:32.742
No one can touch him at school

38:32.743 --> 38:34.010
Did you know that
he raped women?

38:34.011 --> 38:37.647
He bragged about it all the time
He would gather us up...

38:37.648 --> 38:39.983
He recorded it, too
He said he sold it for money

38:39.984 --> 38:42.719
It was to shut the victims up

38:42.720 --> 38:44.921
But he said he sold the video
and bought new jeans

38:44.922 --> 38:47.991
Was he close to Kim Min-gi?

38:47.992 --> 38:49.266
Min-gi?

38:50.661 --> 38:52.800
He's a nobody

38:54.999 --> 38:55.875
That's him

39:02.773 --> 39:05.845
You took out your father's car
that night, didn't you?

39:07.478 --> 39:09.014
Where did you go?

39:10.047 --> 39:12.182
I went for a drive

39:12.183 --> 39:14.026
Where?

39:14.952 --> 39:17.023
Just here and there

39:17.788 --> 39:21.759
Jo Du-sik was with you that night
Where is he?

39:22.760 --> 39:24.706
We know everything

39:26.731 --> 39:29.007
I haven't seen him in awhile

39:30.868 --> 39:33.075
And we're not friends

39:33.637 --> 39:35.617
So you weren't buddies

39:37.108 --> 39:38.712
Buddies my ass

39:40.111 --> 39:43.380
They must've been more interested
in your money or gaming consoles

39:43.381 --> 39:47.150
Plus, you have a free use of car

39:47.151 --> 39:49.722
Did you lend them your car?

39:52.223 --> 39:53.896
No, you drove

39:55.960 --> 39:57.098
Relax

40:03.701 --> 40:05.735
And listen carefully

40:05.736 --> 40:07.837
I don't believe

40:07.838 --> 40:13.789
that you drugged that girl
and raped and killed her

40:18.783 --> 40:21.684
Those bastards used you

40:21.685 --> 40:22.719
What are you on about?

40:22.720 --> 40:24.222
You shot the video

40:25.689 --> 40:29.092
Did you get a hard-on
while shooting it?

40:29.093 --> 40:30.093
Huh?

40:30.094 --> 40:31.437
No

40:31.796 --> 40:34.464
Did you jerk off at home
remembering what you saw?

40:34.465 --> 40:35.498
I said no

40:35.499 --> 40:36.910
Did they let you have a go?

40:40.037 --> 40:42.906
Answer me! Did they?

40:42.907 --> 40:47.151
I did nothing wrong
I really didn't want it

40:50.781 --> 40:52.624
Then, why did you do it?

40:57.021 --> 41:02.021
Cheol-yong said he got some drug
that he wanted to test

41:02.993 --> 41:06.162
Do you know what trouble
I went through to get this?

41:06.163 --> 41:08.565
I got down on my knees for it

41:08.566 --> 41:11.672
Come on
It's my birthday

41:14.271 --> 41:17.040
I didn't do anything

41:17.041 --> 41:20.977
I just dropped them off in front
of the bathhouse, that's all

41:20.978 --> 41:22.651
That's the truth

41:27.852 --> 41:29.525
Where is Jo Du-sik?

41:30.154 --> 41:33.456
I don't know where he is

41:33.457 --> 41:38.161
He said he's going to the beach
To Gangneung

41:38.162 --> 41:39.429
Where in Gangneung?

41:39.430 --> 41:40.663
I don't know exactly

41:40.664 --> 41:42.432
There must be a place
you hang out together

41:42.433 --> 41:44.743
They would never take me there

42:02.720 --> 42:03.755
Hey

42:04.722 --> 42:05.522
Hey

42:05.523 --> 42:06.089
Sir

42:06.090 --> 42:08.057
Did you call the cyber crimes unit?

42:08.058 --> 42:10.293
Yes, because of the videos

42:10.294 --> 42:12.161
I authorized it
Did you get anything?

42:12.162 --> 42:15.732
They found a few videos online

42:15.733 --> 42:19.002
Master Yang' is a known figure
in the community

42:19.003 --> 42:22.917
He's got five records including assault,
distribution of pornographic material

42:23.741 --> 42:27.644
The videos were uploaded only
a few days after they were shot

42:27.645 --> 42:30.647
Jo sold the videos to Yang

42:30.648 --> 42:33.116
Where is this Yang figure?

42:33.117 --> 42:35.495
Gangneung? Why?

42:36.153 --> 42:37.687
Give me his address

42:37.688 --> 42:39.689
and request back up
from the local precinct

42:39.690 --> 42:43.259
Call the terminal
Secure surveillance footage

42:43.260 --> 42:43.459
I really don't have to do anything?

42:43.460 --> 42:45.061
I really don't have to do anything?

42:45.062 --> 42:48.097
Of course not
Ever heard of shelters?

42:48.098 --> 42:50.133
There are state-run shelters
We're private

42:50.134 --> 42:52.535
It's like charity work

42:52.536 --> 42:57.040
Think it through before you decide
The best thing is to go home

42:57.041 --> 42:59.647
Your mothers must be worried

43:00.578 --> 43:01.750
Take care

43:03.614 --> 43:04.786
Bye

43:07.718 --> 43:10.824
Where the hell is Yeong-seop?

43:11.755 --> 43:18.798
Does he know what time it is?
I gotta cut his salary

43:24.134 --> 43:27.170
Can you kill a boar
with an air rifle?

43:27.171 --> 43:29.706
Does that look like an air rifle?

43:29.707 --> 43:31.708
You can't kill shit
with a friggin' air rifle

43:31.709 --> 43:33.242
Awesome

43:33.243 --> 43:36.679
You don't bring me videos anymore
Are you in trouble?

43:36.680 --> 43:41.680
No...I just wanted some air

43:41.685 --> 43:46.191
Study, dipshit!
There is a time for everything

43:47.024 --> 43:51.227
Since you're here, why not
train some new girls?

43:51.228 --> 43:53.299
You saw them just now

43:54.164 --> 43:56.906
I don't do that anymore

44:05.442 --> 44:09.145
I'll send them over to you

44:09.146 --> 44:14.186
You know the 'Emerald's'?

44:16.120 --> 44:17.997
Do some skiing in the while

44:26.130 --> 44:27.697
Internet cafe?

44:27.698 --> 44:30.199
Great job...thanks

44:30.200 --> 44:31.270
Pardon?

44:31.702 --> 44:34.046
There are more properties
in Yang's name?

44:34.705 --> 44:36.013
Myung Sun Institute

44:36.440 --> 44:38.716
Send someone over there, too

44:45.282 --> 44:48.263
Myung Sun Institute

44:58.996 --> 45:00.163
Did you see him?

45:00.164 --> 45:01.631
Of course I did

45:01.632 --> 45:04.545
- He's fit
- Totally

45:11.742 --> 45:12.942
Wanna go for some rice cake?

45:12.943 --> 45:14.354
Pizza and coke

45:41.371 --> 45:42.873
Who's there?

45:46.777 --> 45:48.313
Can I help?

45:50.481 --> 45:52.586
Who referred you here?

45:55.319 --> 45:57.520
I'm looking for Jo Du-sik

45:57.521 --> 46:00.434
Du-sik?

46:01.692 --> 46:03.069
Follow me

46:15.639 --> 46:16.709
Come on in

46:45.736 --> 46:49.438
Take off your clothes
Just the pants

46:49.439 --> 46:51.707
No touching

46:51.708 --> 46:54.211
If you want to do it,
it's 70 dollars extra

46:54.912 --> 46:57.580
What the hell are you doing?

46:57.581 --> 46:58.992
What's the matter with you?

46:59.683 --> 47:02.151
You can't be in a place like this

47:02.152 --> 47:04.120
What the hell?
Don't touch me

47:04.121 --> 47:05.121
Hey

47:05.122 --> 47:07.398
Daddy, he's a freak

47:10.494 --> 47:13.963
What the hell?
Shut the damn door

47:13.964 --> 47:15.841
What the fuck?

47:16.733 --> 47:18.974
What's the matter with you?

47:19.937 --> 47:23.105
If you've got a problem, talk to me
Don't go around poking your head in

47:23.106 --> 47:25.643
Get out

47:28.612 --> 47:31.650
Where is Jo Du-sik?

47:32.316 --> 47:34.684
Why are you looking for him
when you came for some fun?

47:34.685 --> 47:36.752
Come on, man
Let's have a word

47:36.753 --> 47:38.255
Scumbag

47:42.392 --> 47:43.492
Alright, fine

47:43.493 --> 47:45.461
Damn right, I'm a scumbag

47:45.462 --> 47:47.363
Stop poking around,
you son of a bitch

47:47.364 --> 47:52.034
Come out and talk to me,
fucking bastard

47:52.035 --> 47:55.438
Come on, motherfucker

47:55.439 --> 47:57.707
Fucking bitch
Fucking bastard

47:57.708 --> 47:59.709
Goddamn son of a bitch

47:59.710 --> 48:04.352
Did you not think that
I would fight back?

48:05.716 --> 48:07.423
You fucking son of a bitch

48:10.754 --> 48:12.995
Damn

48:16.760 --> 48:19.707
Who are you?

48:25.168 --> 48:26.579
What the hell

48:28.739 --> 48:32.983
What have we got here?

48:33.911 --> 48:36.790
You work in a textile factory?

48:39.216 --> 48:42.184
What's this? Your daughter?

48:42.185 --> 48:43.719
Your daughter and wife, huh?

48:43.720 --> 48:46.326
It's your daughter?

48:48.258 --> 48:53.258
That's what you came looking for

48:53.530 --> 48:55.531
Why couldn't you be nice to her

48:55.532 --> 48:58.701
before she fucking ran away?

48:58.702 --> 49:00.770
Did you think I'd be
keeping them in cages?

49:00.771 --> 49:03.806
This is not the fucking 80's

49:03.807 --> 49:06.776
It's not like that at all
They all come to me voluntarily

49:06.777 --> 49:07.977
Why? For a place to stay

49:07.978 --> 49:09.845
But there's no free lunch

49:09.846 --> 49:13.919
I gotta feed them and
put a roof over their heads

49:20.490 --> 49:23.494
Fuck!

49:23.827 --> 49:26.529
I'm gonna fucking kill you

49:26.530 --> 49:27.975
Who the fuck are you?

49:29.733 --> 49:31.178
Who sent you?

49:41.345 --> 49:43.518
Fuck

49:49.353 --> 49:53.631
Did you think I would
just sit and take it?

50:01.698 --> 50:05.301
I'm gonna fucking kill you, bastard

50:05.302 --> 50:06.576
Jo Du-sik

50:07.871 --> 50:09.248
Fuck!

50:15.912 --> 50:17.255
Jo Du-sik

50:18.515 --> 50:20.961
You...fucking son of a bitch

50:21.718 --> 50:23.386
Where is Jo Du-sik?

50:23.387 --> 50:25.560
I don't know, you fucking bastard

50:26.690 --> 50:27.668
Jo Du-sik

50:30.894 --> 50:32.228
Where is he?

50:32.229 --> 50:33.936
I don't know

50:36.666 --> 50:40.637
Jo Du-sik...where is he?
Where?

50:42.672 --> 50:46.347
Dae...gwallyeong

50:47.644 --> 50:48.411
Lodge...

50:48.412 --> 50:49.891
Where is he?

51:18.708 --> 51:20.119
Daegwallyeong

51:27.684 --> 51:28.788
Lodge...

52:09.726 --> 52:13.105
We're from the police
Open this gate

52:14.030 --> 52:15.475
Hey!

52:16.700 --> 52:19.738
Who are you?

53:08.084 --> 53:09.718
Hello?

53:09.719 --> 53:12.454
This is the Gangneung Precinct

53:12.455 --> 53:14.696
When are you arriving?

53:15.492 --> 53:19.495
Just to let you know
A man was found dead

53:19.496 --> 53:21.567
at Myung Sun Institute

53:21.865 --> 53:22.865
Some one was murdered?

53:22.866 --> 53:23.999
Actually, it's not a cram school

53:24.000 --> 53:24.900
What's the word...

53:24.901 --> 53:27.203
It's a front for a brothel

53:27.204 --> 53:29.972
What about Jo Du-sik?

53:29.973 --> 53:33.742
I don't know any Jo Du-sik

53:33.743 --> 53:35.644
What I want to know is

53:35.645 --> 53:36.979
Lee Sang-hyeon

53:36.980 --> 53:39.348
I think he's from Seoul

53:39.349 --> 53:41.659
Is he the man you're looking for?

53:48.858 --> 53:50.030
Damn it

53:55.665 --> 53:58.434
To be honest, I think these
scumbags must be wiped out

53:58.435 --> 54:00.035
Myung Sun Institute

54:00.036 --> 54:01.570
It's no cram school

54:01.571 --> 54:04.006
He got that place as a collateral
for a gambling debt

54:04.007 --> 54:07.643
He takes in teenagers
who ran away from home

54:07.644 --> 54:09.812
and get them to make porn
and turn tricks there

54:09.813 --> 54:12.381
Bad news is

54:12.382 --> 54:15.551
the dead pimp owned an illegal rifle

54:15.552 --> 54:17.553
and Lee Sang-hyeon took it with him

54:17.554 --> 54:19.192
Why do you think he did?

54:41.811 --> 54:42.678
Listen up

54:42.679 --> 54:46.015
Kids killing adults don't
make the news anymore

54:46.016 --> 54:48.587
but adults killing kids
is a serious matter

55:25.021 --> 55:28.867
Daegwallyeong...Lodge

55:30.827 --> 55:34.673
Map of lodges
in Daegwallyeong

55:49.612 --> 55:52.923
The number you have dialed
is switched off

56:15.939 --> 56:18.977
What's gonna happen to Lee now?

56:20.844 --> 56:25.224
He killed two people

56:26.850 --> 56:29.330
You're okay with the whole thing?

56:35.825 --> 56:38.193
I don't understand

56:38.194 --> 56:41.175
why we have to protect
these scumbags from Lee

56:42.899 --> 56:46.312
Even if we catch Jo,
he'll walk out after a few years

56:47.237 --> 56:48.682
I'm eating

56:51.608 --> 56:58.048
I would have killed the bastard
if I were the father

57:05.722 --> 57:07.689
Get a grip

57:07.690 --> 57:10.759
Lee is a suspect of murder

57:10.760 --> 57:13.028
He's got motive
We've got evidence

57:13.029 --> 57:15.703
And he's about to kill another man

57:17.734 --> 57:19.907
What should we do as cops?

57:31.047 --> 57:34.049
The suspect is reported
to be on the run

57:34.050 --> 57:37.886
to pursue revenge against
another teenager

57:37.887 --> 57:40.458
setting off public distress...

57:45.795 --> 57:49.565
Captain is summoned
by the Commissioner

57:49.566 --> 57:52.701
We still don't know
his where abouts?

57:52.702 --> 57:57.702
We believe he is
still chasing Jo...

57:57.774 --> 58:00.442
Where is Jo?

58:00.443 --> 58:03.245
We're in the process of
tracking him down

58:03.246 --> 58:06.281
There is a murderer at large
with a rifle

58:06.282 --> 58:08.283
and you haven't got a clue
where they are?

58:08.284 --> 58:11.086
If you'll allow a little more time...

58:11.087 --> 58:13.689
What if the kid ends up dead?

58:13.690 --> 58:15.424
Will you take the responsibility?

58:15.425 --> 58:17.159
But why should I...?

58:17.160 --> 58:20.329
Tell them to put it on air
as much as possible

58:20.330 --> 58:21.029
What?

58:21.030 --> 58:25.000
If Jo realizes that his life's at stake,
he'll turn himself in

58:25.001 --> 58:28.270
Then, Lee Sang-hyeon will
eventually turn himself in, too

58:28.271 --> 58:29.771
Lee Sang-hyeon?

58:29.772 --> 58:30.939
He's the murder suspect

58:30.940 --> 58:32.741
Hey

58:32.742 --> 58:34.810
Let's not get melodramatic

58:34.811 --> 58:38.380
Our job isn't to wipe away
the tears of the unfortunate

58:38.381 --> 58:42.951
Find Jo before the reporters
sniff out a scoop

58:42.952 --> 58:45.091
Is he at school now?

58:45.722 --> 58:46.989
I didn't tell them anything

58:46.990 --> 58:51.293
You piece of shit!
The word's out everywhere

58:51.294 --> 58:53.795
I'm in front of Kim Min-gi's house

58:53.796 --> 58:54.934
Over there

58:56.065 --> 58:58.133
Did you know that your son
was involved in the attack?

58:58.134 --> 59:00.035
Is it true that there are
more videos?

59:00.036 --> 59:01.538
Myson has nothing to do with it

59:02.705 --> 59:03.775
Get away from me

59:04.274 --> 59:08.780
He's only 17

59:09.412 --> 59:13.081
What terrible crime
can he have committed?

59:13.082 --> 59:15.722
Leave us alone

59:18.254 --> 59:23.636
We found videos of
your son raping girls

59:25.228 --> 59:27.829
There are more than 20

59:27.830 --> 59:29.064
Rape?

59:29.065 --> 59:34.606
What are you doing?
My boy is dead

59:35.138 --> 59:41.521
He was murdered
What use is all this?

59:47.050 --> 59:49.251
Shut up

59:49.252 --> 59:54.361
What are you doing?
My son is the victim

59:55.992 --> 01:00:00.992
My god...my baby!
What am I gonna do, honey?

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:04.366
Help me

01:00:04.367 --> 01:00:06.702
Please catch the killer

01:00:06.703 --> 01:00:10.172
Catch the killer!

01:00:10.173 --> 01:00:12.307
Cut me some slack

01:00:12.308 --> 01:00:14.776
I feel sorry for the man, too

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:16.311
But how would we look

01:00:16.312 --> 01:00:19.293
if another boy is killed?

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:23.151
Public anger is
lashing back at us

01:00:23.152 --> 01:00:25.564
I'll kill him

01:00:31.027 --> 01:00:32.728
Who's that?

01:00:32.729 --> 01:00:36.331
She's the mother of
one of the rape victims

01:00:36.332 --> 01:00:38.834
The girl killed herself two months ago

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:41.315
For God's sake

01:00:44.607 --> 01:00:47.520
Please catch the perp

01:00:49.712 --> 01:00:53.626
Please catch the boy
that did this

01:01:07.964 --> 01:01:09.064
Excuse me

01:01:09.065 --> 01:01:10.298
Can I help?

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:12.701
I'm looking for some one

01:01:12.702 --> 01:01:17.082
A teenage boy
about 17 years of age

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:22.923
Have you seen a teenage boy?

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.159
I don't think so

01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:44.241
No, sorry

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:49.142
You can't find someone
like that

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:54.621
Try the ski resort
Young people mostly go there

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:33.483
Let's go skiing

01:02:35.318 --> 01:02:36.651
Biggest turnout at ski resorts

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:38.632
Dad

01:02:41.624 --> 01:02:42.659
Huh?

01:02:45.394 --> 01:02:46.634
Come on

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:49.937
I want to go, too

01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:52.943
but who's gonna go to work?

01:02:53.669 --> 01:02:56.843
Dad...

01:02:58.341 --> 01:03:00.082
Oh, forget it

01:03:10.586 --> 01:03:11.826
Well

01:03:13.422 --> 01:03:16.591
Aren't all the young people
at the slopes?

01:03:16.592 --> 01:03:18.401
Try the slopes

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:25.400
We initially assumed
the cause of death was rape

01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:27.702
But it turns out
she had weak kidneys

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:32.448
The official cause of death is
renal failure due to overdose

01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:34.609
We can't charge them for murder?

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:37.412
Rape wasn't the direct cause

01:03:37.413 --> 01:03:40.148
But since it was a heinous crime,
they'll get their punishment

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:42.684
Be straight with me
How long?

01:03:42.685 --> 01:03:43.685
Well...

01:03:43.686 --> 01:03:48.431
2 1/2 years to 7 years tops?

01:03:53.796 --> 01:03:55.639
So, they'll be out in 6 months

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:57.365
That's the law

01:03:57.366 --> 01:03:59.573
There's nothing we can do
Again?

01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:13.557
Sitting around, doing nothing

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:19.432
Is that really the best I can do?

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:28.275
Like this?

01:04:30.499 --> 01:04:32.945
Like an invalid?

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:07.756
Why?

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:09.134
Why?

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:11.430
I'm sorry

01:07:39.522 --> 01:07:40.694
You're good

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:45.103
What brings you here?

01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:47.733
I can't come?

01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:51.478
My friends might ask

01:07:57.807 --> 01:08:00.447
Are you getting your therapy?

01:08:01.677 --> 01:08:03.812
I've straightened up

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:05.121
What?

01:08:10.553 --> 01:08:12.226
Don't come here anymore

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:15.291
I paid for my crimes

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:37.814
Su-jin's father

01:08:46.721 --> 01:08:48.201
I'm sorry

01:08:50.725 --> 01:08:56.198
I'll turn myself in
after I'm done

01:09:02.705 --> 01:09:06.618
Why did you call me
if not turning yourself in?

01:09:13.782 --> 01:09:15.819
I have a favor to ask of you

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:22.957
Lee Sang-hyeon, wanted for
questioning for double homicide

01:09:22.957 --> 01:09:26.127
is confirmed to be on the run

01:09:26.127 --> 01:09:30.765
in Daegwallyeong mountain region

01:09:30.765 --> 01:09:34.736
He is reported to be
carrying a fire arm

01:09:34.737 --> 01:09:36.904
For whatever reason

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:41.109
seeking vigilante justice
is a clear criminal act

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:44.683
The police is deploying
all available resources...

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:48.550
The girls at Myung Sun Institute said

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:51.452
that there is a lodge
that Yang used a lot

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:54.756
I think he shot porn there

01:09:54.757 --> 01:09:56.491
It's called Emerald Lodge
I'll give you the address

01:09:56.492 --> 01:09:57.869
It's called Emerald Lodge
I'll give you the address

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:17.178
You...
What's your name?

01:10:17.179 --> 01:10:18.954
Jo Du-sik

01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:42.512
Damn it

01:10:44.607 --> 01:10:45.673
Sergeant

01:10:45.674 --> 01:10:47.244
The window's open

01:10:58.954 --> 01:11:00.456
This is it

01:11:18.707 --> 01:11:19.540
Hello?

01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:21.509
You alone?

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:22.744
What's going on?

01:11:22.745 --> 01:11:25.346
Hey, Du-sik

01:11:25.347 --> 01:11:27.327
Did the cops show up?

01:11:29.151 --> 01:11:32.186
No, not here

01:11:32.187 --> 01:11:35.356
You see? What did I tell ya?

01:11:35.357 --> 01:11:37.166
Dumbass

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:39.795
Why doesn't Cheol-yong
answer my calls?

01:11:41.664 --> 01:11:43.931
How would I know, man?

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:48.932
Where the hell is he hiding?
If he calls,

01:11:49.738 --> 01:11:52.940
tell him that my phone is dead
so, come to Emerald's

01:11:52.941 --> 01:11:55.743
What's that place?

01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:59.614
He'll know
Just tell him, moron!

01:11:59.615 --> 01:12:01.322
Fucking retard

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:02.920
Du-sik

01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:07.955
What?
What's going on?

01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:11.426
Piss off, morons

01:12:12.861 --> 01:12:16.502
Did someone call?
I heard the phone ring

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:18.866
Huh?

01:12:18.867 --> 01:12:19.734
I don't know

01:12:19.735 --> 01:12:21.869
Don't you give me that tone

01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:23.738
Come on, darling...don't

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:25.606
What mess you got yourself into?

01:12:25.607 --> 01:12:27.709
You should have come to me

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:30.247
What are you telling him off for?
It wasn't his fault

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:33.014
Min-gi, darling

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:35.016
- You've done nothing wrong
- For crying out loud!

01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:36.984
Don't bother to study
Don't go to school

01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:38.586
Why don't you go outside and cool off?

01:12:38.587 --> 01:12:40.021
What the hell, woman?

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:41.723
You must cooperate to the police

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:44.692
You'll get clemency that way

01:12:44.693 --> 01:12:48.641
If Du-sik gets caught, he'll
insist that I'm an accomplice

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:54.669
Don't you worry about that
Mom and dad will take care of it

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:56.971
Tell me if he calls

01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:58.940
Okay?

01:12:58.941 --> 01:13:00.648
Okay

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:04.979
Let's get out of here, honey

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.323
Come on

01:13:25.134 --> 01:13:27.341
I can't believe
I have that for a son

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:32.683
Don't talk like that
Our boy is a victim, too

01:13:36.812 --> 01:13:39.981
What if that boy testifies
that Min-gi was an accomplice?

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:44.658
He'll get what he deserves

01:13:47.523 --> 01:13:52.529
It would be best if
he ends up dead, too

01:13:55.798 --> 01:13:58.301
What are you saying?

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:36.681
Get him

01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:42.120
Bastard!

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:33.961
Are you crazy?

01:15:33.962 --> 01:15:35.669
What the hell?

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:47.111
Sir

01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:49.416
Lee's phone is switched on

01:15:50.979 --> 01:15:52.513
Here

01:15:52.514 --> 01:15:54.148
Near the ski resort

01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:55.492
Which one?

01:15:56.685 --> 01:15:57.885
Here

01:15:57.886 --> 01:15:59.253
This one

01:15:59.254 --> 01:16:01.689
Send me the picture first

01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:04.125
Send everyone over to the resort

01:16:04.126 --> 01:16:08.062
We got a sighting of Jo
at the Alpensia

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:10.665
So, Lee and Jo are
in the same place?

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:11.872
Check out the picture

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:14.042
Is this right?

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:18.874
Isn't that Lee Sang-hyeon?

01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:22.810
It's him

01:16:22.811 --> 01:16:24.011
Lee Sang-hyeon?

01:16:24.012 --> 01:16:25.355
It is him!

01:16:26.048 --> 01:16:26.714
Hey

01:16:26.715 --> 01:16:30.251
Dispatch patrol and
call the headquarters

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:35.292
Hey, wait
You can't just leave

01:16:37.159 --> 01:16:39.662
You didn't even know
what he looked like?

01:16:41.997 --> 01:16:47.470
You thought you could
recognize him if you saw him?

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:54.618
How can you be so stupid

01:17:00.682 --> 01:17:02.855
So many police everywhere

01:17:04.319 --> 01:17:07.455
Fucking bastards

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:09.231
I should have killed them

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:12.596
Damn it

01:17:26.842 --> 01:17:29.322
You gotta get the fluid drain out

01:17:31.213 --> 01:17:33.693
I know a guy who
lost his foot to frostbite

01:17:36.852 --> 01:17:38.559
Go to the hospital

01:18:00.976 --> 01:18:02.478
What's your problem?

01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:08.728
What?

01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:18.000
What's your name?

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:32.480
Kim Min-gi

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:41.194
Why do you ask?

01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:47.691
Where am I?

01:18:53.328 --> 01:18:58.710
Why did he turn on the phone
and risk being tracked?

01:19:04.706 --> 01:19:07.186
Jo Du-sikat Emerald's

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.517
Driver

01:19:14.282 --> 01:19:19.630
How did Lee know where
Kim Cheol-yong lived?

01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:25.066
It's been hanging
at the back of my mind

01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:31.009
Emerald Lodge...

01:19:36.204 --> 01:19:38.741
He's waiting for someone's call

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:41.713
What is it?

01:19:44.646 --> 01:19:47.715
Aren't you coming?

01:19:47.716 --> 01:19:49.717
We almost cracked the case

01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:53.825
I don't care if it's Jo or Lee
Let's go get them

01:19:55.056 --> 01:19:57.468
Come on, man

01:19:58.426 --> 01:20:00.995
We won't catch up in time

01:20:00.996 --> 01:20:05.996
If Lee has an informant,
he will show up here

01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:11.501
You can't expect us to
just sit around here

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:16.410
Open up all the checkpoints
leading up here

01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:18.245
Are you out of your mind?

01:20:18.246 --> 01:20:22.383
We should tighten security
if we can

01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:24.685
Are you willing to catch
the bastard or not?

01:20:24.686 --> 01:20:27.394
Do as you please

01:20:58.687 --> 01:21:02.396
What the hell are we
doing out here?

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:09.330
Can you believe that
he was out skiing?

01:21:09.331 --> 01:21:13.033
He doesn't have a clue
he is being hunted down

01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:14.638
Shut up

01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:16.808
Did you know

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:21.080
that Su-jin's teeth were cracked?

01:21:25.113 --> 01:21:29.149
She gritted her teeth so hard
that her molars cracked

01:21:29.150 --> 01:21:31.221
#NAME?

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:38.659
Can you see who it is?

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:40.261
We have no clear visual

01:21:40.262 --> 01:21:40.895
Should we get him?

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:42.273
Wait

01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:45.466
We'll catch him
after he goes inside

01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:46.639
Yes, sir

01:22:18.633 --> 01:22:19.873
Jo Du-sik

01:22:32.914 --> 01:22:34.587
Who are you?

01:22:43.024 --> 01:22:44.692
Go outside

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:46.660
It's freezing out

01:22:46.661 --> 01:22:48.562
She says that Jo
is on his way here

01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:49.663
You don't know
if he'll show up

01:22:49.664 --> 01:22:51.575
What the heck?

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:56.003
You don't know
when he's coming?

01:22:56.004 --> 01:22:57.642
I said I don't

01:22:58.673 --> 01:23:00.574
Are you sure he's coming?

01:23:00.575 --> 01:23:04.216
How would I know that?
Fuck, you're annoying

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:07.694
Why are you staying with him?

01:23:08.683 --> 01:23:11.687
How can you like him?

01:23:18.693 --> 01:23:20.502
I've seen you before

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:24.473
In that video...

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:48.752
In the wind, someone
is calling your name...

01:23:49.624 --> 01:23:53.367
Shit!
I forgot the cigarettes

01:24:01.503 --> 01:24:02.641
Where is your phone?

01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:10.681
Act natural
We just need him to come here

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:16.161
And you won't tell my mom

01:24:40.575 --> 01:24:42.676
What took you so long
to answer, bitch?

01:24:42.677 --> 01:24:44.678
Did you change your number?

01:24:44.679 --> 01:24:46.980
I just got a new one

01:24:46.981 --> 01:24:48.682
I'm almost here but
I forgot my smoke

01:24:48.683 --> 01:24:50.060
You got some?

01:25:20.482 --> 01:25:23.019
Hello?
If not, I'll go get some

01:25:49.677 --> 01:25:52.658
Kim Min-gi

01:25:58.586 --> 01:25:59.860
Run!

01:26:00.855 --> 01:26:02.163
Hey

01:26:02.957 --> 01:26:04.091
Jo Du-sik

01:26:04.092 --> 01:26:06.727
Jo Du-sik, you bastard

01:26:06.728 --> 01:26:07.728
Freeze

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:08.707
Damn it

01:26:09.497 --> 01:26:10.669
Jo Du-sik

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:15.035
He's heading your way

01:26:15.036 --> 01:26:17.915
Seal off the exit

01:26:23.711 --> 01:26:24.917
Bastard

01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:43.675
Jo Du-sik

01:26:53.274 --> 01:26:54.844
Lee Sang-hyeon

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:00.819
You're here, aren't you?

01:27:04.719 --> 01:27:06.562
I know you are

01:27:09.791 --> 01:27:15.264
Jo must be
in our custody by now

01:27:21.102 --> 01:27:23.173
You can stop now

01:27:27.742 --> 01:27:30.018
There is nothing more you can do

01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:44.700
Run him over if you have to

01:27:47.028 --> 01:27:48.666
Jo Du-sik

01:27:50.698 --> 01:27:53.679
We lost him
Damn it, where'd he go?

01:28:55.029 --> 01:28:56.667
Mr. Lee!

01:31:50.137 --> 01:31:51.138
Dad

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:57.915
You can stop now

01:32:00.014 --> 01:32:01.584
No

01:32:03.084 --> 01:32:08.090
Daddy can walk some more

01:32:14.695 --> 01:32:16.675
Just stop

01:32:19.667 --> 01:32:21.510
What about my poor girl?

01:32:22.703 --> 01:32:27.675
If I stop here

01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:31.417
then, my poor daughter...

01:32:34.282 --> 01:32:38.992
She'll just be forgotten

01:32:43.624 --> 01:32:49.631
And it'll all just be nothing

01:32:53.034 --> 01:32:54.672
Nothing

01:32:56.737 --> 01:32:58.375
My daughter

01:33:02.777 --> 01:33:05.758
My daughter Su-jin's dead

01:33:08.482 --> 01:33:11.759
and that becomes nothing

01:33:17.224 --> 01:33:23.140
I'm so mortified and angry

01:33:26.834 --> 01:33:29.405
and so sorry for her

01:33:45.152 --> 01:33:47.996
I'm sorry, Su-jin

01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:55.297
I'm so sorry, Su-jin

01:34:02.236 --> 01:34:04.648
I'm so sorry

01:34:24.425 --> 01:34:27.167
Keep on with the good work

01:34:27.962 --> 01:34:30.997
They lost Lee?
I thought we had his location

01:34:30.998 --> 01:34:33.533
It's dark and the weather is hostile

01:34:33.534 --> 01:34:36.269
They can't dispatch the search party

01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:38.944
Du-sik doesn't call me anymore

01:34:39.874 --> 01:34:41.408
He'll come and get me

01:34:41.409 --> 01:34:42.942
Shut up, punk

01:34:42.943 --> 01:34:44.678
But he's right

01:34:44.679 --> 01:34:46.846
If he has a brain,
he won't call here

01:34:46.847 --> 01:34:50.984
What's going to happen to Du-sik?

01:34:50.985 --> 01:34:54.688
Worry about your own ass

01:34:54.689 --> 01:34:58.967
Your scary friends will
come back in no time

01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:04.334
I brought some snack

01:35:09.036 --> 01:35:12.238
He hasn't called yet?

01:35:12.239 --> 01:35:14.719
Unfortunately not

01:35:17.311 --> 01:35:20.190
Sit straight, boy

01:35:20.915 --> 01:35:23.416
You only lent them your car
because they threatened you

01:35:23.417 --> 01:35:26.019
Detectives here all know that

01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:27.397
Isn't that right?

01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:32.663
Well...

01:35:33.928 --> 01:35:38.928
Maybe something
happened to that boy

01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:43.002
Where would that leave my son?

01:35:43.003 --> 01:35:46.177
Just get out of here

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:55.661
It's a call from
area code 033

01:35:59.186 --> 01:36:00.553
Check the number
Run it now

01:36:00.554 --> 01:36:04.024
Act casual and stay focused

01:36:06.327 --> 01:36:07.026
Hello?

01:36:07.027 --> 01:36:09.295
What took you so long to answer?

01:36:09.296 --> 01:36:11.731
Is Cheol-yong really dead?

01:36:11.732 --> 01:36:13.733
Why didn't you tell me that?

01:36:13.734 --> 01:36:14.734
Well, I...

01:36:14.735 --> 01:36:19.239
Is it true that it was
the girl's father?

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.740
Looks that way

01:36:20.741 --> 01:36:24.416
You gotta be kidding me

01:36:25.312 --> 01:36:27.247
I think they found the videos

01:36:27.248 --> 01:36:32.220
It doesn't matter, prick
It's no evidence that we killed her

01:36:33.454 --> 01:36:34.387
You

01:36:34.388 --> 01:36:36.489
You told the cops that I'm here

01:36:36.490 --> 01:36:37.390
That's crazy

01:36:37.391 --> 01:36:40.493
Then, how did the police
come looking for me?

01:36:40.494 --> 01:36:42.762
How would I know that?

01:36:42.763 --> 01:36:44.674
If you go behind my back

01:36:44.732 --> 01:36:45.999
I'll shove goddamn
pool balls up your ass

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.001
Tell him to turn himself in

01:36:48.002 --> 01:36:49.504
You hear me?

01:36:51.605 --> 01:36:54.245
Maybe you should
turn yourself in

01:36:56.243 --> 01:36:59.383
I will, moron

01:37:00.681 --> 01:37:03.855
I'II go to jail

01:37:07.121 --> 01:37:09.289
You got some money?

01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:10.356
What for?

01:37:10.357 --> 01:37:13.133
If I go to jail, I won't be
able to have fun for a while

01:37:16.330 --> 01:37:17.673
How much?

01:37:26.273 --> 01:37:29.482
Okay...How should I
give it to you?

01:37:38.018 --> 01:37:43.297
Let's come back later

01:37:44.725 --> 01:37:48.502
Even if he froze to death here
he's probably buried in snow

01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:52.010
Shall we go on standby?

01:37:58.372 --> 01:37:59.612
Hello?

01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:10.585
Jo Du-sik is coming
to the train station at noon

01:38:12.887 --> 01:38:16.733
Mr. Lee, the situation is serious

01:38:19.293 --> 01:38:20.931
Leave it to us

01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:27.369
Then what?

01:38:30.471 --> 01:38:32.815
What's gonna happen to Jo?

01:38:39.013 --> 01:38:40.993
Was it Cheol-yong,
the kid's name?

01:38:43.717 --> 01:38:46.596
Do you know what he said
to me before he died?

01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:55.069
He said he was sorry

01:38:59.466 --> 01:39:05.610
Sorry for stealing it

01:39:12.212 --> 01:39:17.212
He thought I was there
about some stolen stuff

01:39:24.124 --> 01:39:30.006
How can he be like that?

01:39:32.766 --> 01:39:35.713
What do you think I should do?

01:39:44.144 --> 01:39:47.318
Did killing him give you consolation?

01:39:53.554 --> 01:39:56.694
Nothing will change
even if you kill Jo

01:40:14.274 --> 01:40:16.083
I have a favor to ask of you

01:41:12.499 --> 01:41:12.565
Gangneung Station

01:41:12.566 --> 01:41:13.943
Gangneung Station

01:41:22.609 --> 01:41:25.678
Did you find Lee?

01:41:25.679 --> 01:41:28.592
The search party never found him

01:41:29.983 --> 01:41:32.691
There are 20 undercover cops
at the station

01:41:40.661 --> 01:41:43.830
He'll figure out that I ratted him out

01:41:43.831 --> 01:41:45.965
I'll be keeping my eyes on you

01:41:45.966 --> 01:41:49.836
If you see him, signal us
by taking off your hat

01:41:49.837 --> 01:41:54.252
We'll take it from there, understood?

01:41:58.946 --> 01:42:01.914
He's on the move
Get ready

01:42:01.915 --> 01:42:06.915
As you know, the Daegwallyeong
search party hasn't found Lee yet

01:42:07.521 --> 01:42:11.657
Remain open to all possibilities
and stay focused

01:42:11.658 --> 01:42:15.962
Once again, our job is to bring
Jo Du-sik safely into custody

01:42:15.963 --> 01:42:19.672
You want us to shoot Lee down
if he shows up?

01:42:21.568 --> 01:42:26.677
We're not gunning him down
I want you to stop him

01:42:28.575 --> 01:42:31.317
You may only open fire
upon order from control car

01:42:43.891 --> 01:42:46.030
Control car, are you keeping taps?

01:42:47.794 --> 01:42:50.363
We're tracing the signal, sir

01:42:50.364 --> 01:42:51.464
Where is his location?

01:42:51.465 --> 01:42:54.639
He's almost here
Wait...

01:42:57.004 --> 01:43:01.674
He hung up too soon
We can only confirm he's in the area

01:43:01.675 --> 01:43:02.676
Damn

01:43:05.312 --> 01:43:06.712
Move with the target

01:43:06.713 --> 01:43:08.283
Team B, go

01:43:09.883 --> 01:43:11.726
Keep your distance

01:43:14.721 --> 01:43:17.723
Where does this street lead?

01:43:17.724 --> 01:43:22.724
To the town center
It'll be packed with people

01:43:25.132 --> 01:43:26.732
Shouldn't we block the escape route?

01:43:26.733 --> 01:43:28.644
Shut up and follow him

01:43:34.474 --> 01:43:38.650
Shit, I think we lost him

01:43:40.647 --> 01:43:41.421
Get him!

01:43:41.982 --> 01:43:42.960
Hey! You!

01:43:46.687 --> 01:43:47.665
Stop

01:44:00.167 --> 01:44:01.475
Go that way

01:44:03.503 --> 01:44:04.607
This way, come on

01:44:25.659 --> 01:44:27.434
What took you so long?

01:44:28.996 --> 01:44:30.339
Where's the money?

01:44:32.032 --> 01:44:33.306
The money, man?

01:44:39.773 --> 01:44:40.911
The money!

01:44:46.747 --> 01:44:48.317
We have no visual

01:44:50.684 --> 01:44:51.651
They're at the crossroads

01:44:51.652 --> 01:44:53.686
Which one, dickhead?

01:44:53.687 --> 01:44:55.667
The pharmacy crossroads

01:45:09.736 --> 01:45:11.837
Where's the money, moron?

01:45:11.838 --> 01:45:14.073
Well, actually...

01:45:14.074 --> 01:45:15.747
Where's the money?

01:45:17.711 --> 01:45:19.952
Hey, my money

01:45:21.481 --> 01:45:22.858
Where's my money?

01:45:24.117 --> 01:45:26.752
You fucking moron

01:45:26.753 --> 01:45:28.699
I didn't do anything

01:45:29.723 --> 01:45:31.031
What are you talking about?

01:45:32.659 --> 01:45:33.660
Jo Du-sik

01:45:35.696 --> 01:45:36.674
Stop!

01:45:37.698 --> 01:45:38.731
You sold me out

01:45:38.732 --> 01:45:39.865
Get him

01:45:39.866 --> 01:45:40.700
Hey, you

01:45:40.701 --> 01:45:41.679
Come here, you prick

01:46:01.888 --> 01:46:03.196
Jo Du-sik

01:46:05.058 --> 01:46:05.934
Stop

01:46:12.566 --> 01:46:14.767
Out of my way

01:46:14.768 --> 01:46:18.477
Jo Du-sik, stop

01:46:21.641 --> 01:46:22.915
Stop!

01:46:55.942 --> 01:46:59.549
Lee Sang-hyeon is here

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:02.660
Lee is at the square

01:47:16.196 --> 01:47:19.064
Lee Sang-hyeon!
Drop the gun

01:47:19.065 --> 01:47:21.233
Lee, drop the gun

01:47:21.234 --> 01:47:24.704
Drop the gun now, damn it

01:47:30.677 --> 01:47:32.211
He is armed with a rifle

01:47:32.212 --> 01:47:34.046
Drop the damn gun

01:47:34.047 --> 01:47:36.357
Don't move

01:47:37.717 --> 01:47:38.991
I'll turn myself in

01:47:39.453 --> 01:47:40.286
Stand still

01:47:40.287 --> 01:47:41.698
I will, I will...

01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:46.599
I'm turning myself in, man

01:47:51.665 --> 01:47:53.042
We have a situation here

01:47:54.568 --> 01:47:57.870
What's he doing?

01:47:57.871 --> 01:47:59.271
Find away

01:47:59.272 --> 01:48:02.041
Drop the gun, Lee

01:48:02.042 --> 01:48:03.776
I'll turn myself in, man

01:48:03.777 --> 01:48:05.415
Stand still

01:48:08.515 --> 01:48:10.716
Please stop this man

01:48:10.717 --> 01:48:14.119
Stop him!
I'm turning myself in

01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:15.929
I'm turning myself in, damn it

01:48:17.023 --> 01:48:18.263
Fucking hell!

01:48:31.271 --> 01:48:35.140
You're clear to open fire

01:48:35.141 --> 01:48:36.643
Save the boy

01:48:38.612 --> 01:48:40.246
Don't shoot, son of a bitch

01:48:40.247 --> 01:48:41.692
Lower the gun, damn it

01:48:42.549 --> 01:48:44.290
Put the gun down

01:48:46.086 --> 01:48:47.565
Mr. Lee

01:48:50.490 --> 01:48:54.233
Let us bring him in

01:48:55.095 --> 01:48:56.665
Drop your weapon

01:49:00.033 --> 01:49:01.740
Why did you do it?

01:49:04.170 --> 01:49:08.607
It wasn't me
I didn't do it, man

01:49:08.608 --> 01:49:11.043
Shut the hell up, prick

01:49:11.044 --> 01:49:16.995
But it's true
It was Cheol-yong

01:49:22.188 --> 01:49:24.290
Listen to me, Mr. Lee

01:49:24.291 --> 01:49:29.291
I will make sure that
I see this through to the end

01:49:31.197 --> 01:49:35.236
So, put the gun down

01:49:44.878 --> 01:49:46.687
I'm giving you my words

01:50:16.576 --> 01:50:18.214
Jo Du-sik

01:50:20.347 --> 01:50:22.327
is a monster

01:50:25.418 --> 01:50:27.557
who kidnapped my daughter

01:50:30.757 --> 01:50:32.566
drugged her

01:50:33.994 --> 01:50:35.940
and raped...

01:50:38.932 --> 01:50:41.606
raped her like an animal

01:50:43.536 --> 01:50:45.573
and murdered her in cold blood

01:50:49.976 --> 01:50:55.119
I cannot breathe

01:51:02.188 --> 01:51:05.391
the same air as this monster!

01:51:05.392 --> 01:51:07.303
Come to your fucking senses

01:51:08.862 --> 01:51:11.172
You gotta stick it out
no matter what

01:51:12.832 --> 01:51:19.215
and see it through to the end

01:51:21.441 --> 01:51:22.852
Mr. Lee

01:51:30.050 --> 01:51:31.620
Lee Sang-hyeon!

01:52:51.598 --> 01:52:52.770
Su-jin

01:52:55.068 --> 01:52:56.342
Su-jin!

01:53:21.594 --> 01:53:25.063
I got asked out today

01:53:25.064 --> 01:53:26.543
Really?

01:53:51.591 --> 01:53:53.628
I have a favor to ask of you

01:54:03.503 --> 01:54:06.211
I couldn't leave it behind
in that filthy house

01:54:13.112 --> 01:54:18.494
If for some reason,
I'm unable to do it myself

01:54:21.554 --> 01:54:23.932
please retrieve it
and burn it for me

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:42.415
I knew I would find you here

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:56.530
What are you doing here everyday?

01:55:05.365 --> 01:55:09.836
The anonymous informant
turned out to be Min-gi

01:55:11.471 --> 01:55:18.514
But he insists that he never
sent that last message

01:55:22.715 --> 01:55:24.695
That Jo Du-sik boy...

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:33.500
How much will he
think about Su-jin?

01:55:37.697 --> 01:55:41.667
The boy who killed his friend
for a game CD

01:55:41.668 --> 01:55:43.841
is playing basketball laughing

01:55:46.706 --> 01:55:51.655
The dead kid became
the stepping stone for a new life

01:55:55.448 --> 01:55:58.583
In the 17 years I've been a cop

01:55:58.584 --> 01:56:02.589
nothing has changed
in what I tell the victim's family

01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:09.540
I tell them to wait

01:56:13.199 --> 01:56:15.702
Wait for the law to serve justice

01:56:17.737 --> 01:56:20.547
To the people who lost everything

01:56:26.713 --> 01:56:28.454
Is that why you texted him?

01:56:33.619 --> 01:56:35.530
What about his life?

01:56:47.667 --> 01:56:49.704
Life no longer exists

01:56:53.139 --> 01:56:55.517
to the parent who has lost his child

01:56:56.042 --> 01:56:57.578
Please sit down

01:57:06.519 --> 01:57:07.623
Then...

01:57:12.025 --> 01:57:14.993
Is this how this ends?

01:57:14.994 --> 01:57:19.994
All rise. The court is now in session

01:57:20.733 --> 01:57:23.735
for case no. 2012/2312,
State vs Jo Du-sik

01:57:23.736 --> 01:57:27.707
under Sexual Offense Prevention Act

01:57:43.723 --> 01:57:44.963
No

01:57:51.564 --> 01:57:53.373
I promised, didn't I?

01:57:56.702 --> 01:57:58.682
That I would watch him to the end

01:58:30.736 --> 01:58:40.180
BROKEN

01:58:45.852 --> 01:58:50.767
JUNG JAE-YOUNG LEE SUNG-MIN
