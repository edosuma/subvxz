00:01.088 --> 00:02.741
<i>Previously on "Alaska Daily"...</i>

00:02.741 --> 00:04.134
So you really are a pilot.

00:04.134 --> 00:06.006
Read my poems. I wasn't
making that up, either.

00:06.528 --> 00:08.617
Can I, uh, buy you a drink
as a thank-you?

00:08.617 --> 00:11.272
I'm gonna pass on the drink.
Good luck with your article.

00:11.272 --> 00:14.275
Good kiss,
but it can't happen again.

00:14.275 --> 00:15.667
Understood.

00:15.667 --> 00:18.409
Turns out this pro-fishing guy
is financed by mining.

00:18.409 --> 00:21.282
Frank Moses is the most
competent person in this race.

00:21.282 --> 00:23.806
Just doesn't seem like you have
much of a story to me, Stanley.

00:23.806 --> 00:26.765
Hi, Ken. I'd like to know more
about the Pritchard family.

00:26.765 --> 00:30.378
I want to understand what they
stood to gain if Moses won.

00:30.378 --> 00:34.121
Whoever killed Gloria is sure
that he will never be found.

00:34.121 --> 00:35.644
The un-redacted
police report.

00:35.644 --> 00:37.776
Two names--
Ezra Fisher and Rega Horne.

00:37.776 --> 00:39.343
Rega Horne might as well
not exist.

00:39.343 --> 00:41.563
Search engines, socials--
they turn up nothing.

00:41.563 --> 00:43.217
Hello,
Concerned Citizen.

00:43.217 --> 00:44.566
Concerned Citizen:
<i>Did you get my gift?</i>

00:44.566 --> 00:46.829
I did. Things are
getting serious between us.

00:46.829 --> 00:48.352
<i>The next bullet you receive
won't be in a box.</i>

00:55.359 --> 00:56.665
Hey, y'all!

00:56.665 --> 00:58.145
It's Cruise Day number three,

00:58.145 --> 01:00.538
and we are a long way
from Houston.

01:00.538 --> 01:03.063
Last night was insane.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.934
Let's just say I had
one too many glacier-tinis.

01:06.675 --> 01:08.590
Brinkley and Audrey
passed out a while ago,

01:08.590 --> 01:10.722
but since a lot of you
have been asking me

01:10.722 --> 01:12.811
for videos of the views,

01:12.811 --> 01:13.943
I stayed up all night

01:13.943 --> 01:16.337
so I could show y'all...

01:16.337 --> 01:18.121
the sunrise. Ha!

01:18.121 --> 01:20.906
<i>Alaska is pretty lit, y'all.</i>

01:22.343 --> 01:23.996
<i>Oh, no!</i>

01:29.132 --> 01:31.134
Hello, Doug.
How are things in Seattle?

01:31.134 --> 01:33.310
<i>Doing our best
to keep up with the news.</i>

01:33.310 --> 01:35.007
<i>Speaking of--
I'm sure you saw the video?</i>

01:35.007 --> 01:37.793
I did, about 11 times.
It's sad.

01:37.793 --> 01:39.142
<i>When did she go missing?</i>

01:39.142 --> 01:41.013
Sometime early this morning,
near Seward.

01:41.013 --> 01:42.493
<i>Well, it looks like
it's blowing up.</i>

01:42.493 --> 01:44.495
<i>The video has
a million views already.</i>

01:44.495 --> 01:47.324
<i>Any stringers you recommend?
I need some coverage.</i>

01:47.324 --> 01:49.413
I'll see what I can do.
I've gotten similar calls

01:49.413 --> 01:51.372
from Dallas, Phoenix...

01:51.372 --> 01:53.678
...Chicago, and New York,
but you're top of my list.

01:53.678 --> 01:56.464
<i>I appreciate that, Stanley.
Say hi to Claire for me.</i>

01:56.464 --> 01:58.683
Will do, buddy, but she's
never leaving Anchorage.

02:05.647 --> 02:10.217
Stanley Cornik.

02:17.180 --> 02:18.747
With us today,
<i>Daily Alaskan</i> reporters

02:18.747 --> 02:22.794
Eileen Fitzgerald
and Roz Friendly.
Eileen, Roz, welcome.

02:22.794 --> 02:24.361
- Good to be here, Tim.
- Thanks for having us.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.015
So, I want to discuss the
impact of your recent reporting

02:26.015 --> 02:27.886
about Meade Police Chief Durkin

02:27.886 --> 02:29.671
and Anchorage ADA
Adam Barnett.

02:29.671 --> 02:31.847
The stories can be found
on TheDailyAlaskan.com,

02:31.847 --> 02:34.589
but for anyone
who hasn't read them,

02:34.589 --> 02:35.764
tell us what happened.

02:35.764 --> 02:37.722
Well, through
our reporting,

02:37.722 --> 02:39.811
uh, we discovered
that Chief Durkin

02:39.811 --> 02:42.162
was classifying
his sexual-assault cases

02:42.162 --> 02:45.034
as "unfounded"
at an alarmingly high rate.

02:45.034 --> 02:48.211
When a case
is deemed "unfounded,"

02:48.211 --> 02:50.648
it means that the crime
didn't happen.

02:50.648 --> 02:53.216
And if the crime didn't happen,
it doesn't have to be solved.

02:53.216 --> 02:56.828
Exactly. And we found out
that ADA Barnett was preying

02:56.828 --> 03:00.049
on his female plaintiffs,
re-victimizing them.

03:00.049 --> 03:02.399
Following the publication of
your stories, Durkin was fired.

03:02.399 --> 03:05.489
So was Barnett, and we expect
him to be disbarred.

03:05.489 --> 03:06.882
Both of these stories

03:06.882 --> 03:09.058
are emblematic
of the systemic problems

03:09.058 --> 03:10.973
that plague
the Alaska legal system.

03:10.973 --> 03:13.236
And it highlights
why local reporting,

03:13.236 --> 03:15.412
disappearing across
this country, matters.

03:15.412 --> 03:18.110
We're happy to shed light
on the issues.

03:18.110 --> 03:20.112
When you expose people
like this,

03:20.112 --> 03:21.853
do you worry
about blowback?

03:21.853 --> 03:23.420
Exposing corruption definitely
has its consequences,

03:23.420 --> 03:25.248
but it doesn't deter us
from doing our job.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.294
Agreed. Most people
are just so busy

03:27.294 --> 03:30.775
trying to get through the day
with work and family and life.

03:30.775 --> 03:32.647
Someone has to expose
these guys.

03:32.647 --> 03:34.431
So if not us, then who?

03:34.431 --> 03:36.477
Okay, we have a caller.

03:36.477 --> 03:39.262
"Concerned Citizen,"
you're on the air.

03:39.262 --> 03:41.003
Concerned Citizen: <i>Yeah.</i>

03:41.003 --> 03:42.483
<i>I don't know why you're
all celebrating this.</i>

03:42.483 --> 03:43.962
Do you have a question
for the reporters?

03:43.962 --> 03:46.008
<i>Yeah, I do.</i>

03:46.008 --> 03:48.010
<i>Why are you still here, Eileen?</i>

03:48.010 --> 03:49.838
I have a job to do,
serving the interests

03:49.838 --> 03:51.970
of the Alaskan people.

03:51.970 --> 03:54.582
<i>What do you know about
the interests of Alaskans?</i>

03:54.582 --> 03:56.236
<i>You think you're
some kind of crusader,</i>

03:56.236 --> 03:58.063
<i>but you're
a carpetbagging meddler.</i>

03:58.063 --> 04:00.631
<i>And a liar.
You need to be stopped.</i>

04:00.631 --> 04:02.111
We're gonna take a quick break

04:02.111 --> 04:04.026
and be right back
with a question,

04:04.026 --> 04:07.421
hopefully a more polite one,
from Pam in Wasilla.

04:10.902 --> 04:13.078
Morning, Claire!

04:13.078 --> 04:14.819
Doug from Seattle
says hi.

04:14.819 --> 04:17.518
That's nice. Tell him
I'm never leaving Anchorage.

04:17.518 --> 04:20.303
Already did. You heard about
the girl who went missing

04:20.303 --> 04:22.044
from the cruise ship
this morning?

04:22.044 --> 04:23.524
I'm slammed.
I'm on Mayhem.

04:23.524 --> 04:25.265
Mayhem is breaking news.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.310
A girl falling off a ship
<i>is</i> mayhem.

04:27.310 --> 04:28.833
I've got a flood
in Eagle Village,

04:28.833 --> 04:31.140
I've got a truck that flipped
into the Matanuska River,

04:31.140 --> 04:33.316
I've got a Fish and Game captain
with eight hunting violations,

04:33.316 --> 04:34.926
I've got overflow
at a homeless shelter,

04:34.926 --> 04:36.537
<i>and</i> I'm covering
the Arts gala tonight.

04:36.537 --> 04:38.452
Say no more.

04:45.415 --> 04:48.157
Roz, can you cover
the girl who disappeared

04:48.157 --> 04:50.115
from the cruise ship
in Seward?

04:50.115 --> 04:52.248
Did you hear
about Jade Jacobs?

04:52.248 --> 04:54.468
She's a Yup'ik woman who
went missing two days ago.

04:54.468 --> 04:56.426
No, I didn't hear
about her.

04:56.426 --> 04:58.820
She met up with friends
at Russian Pratatsky Park.

04:58.820 --> 05:03.041
She was feeling sick, left,
and never made it home.

05:03.041 --> 05:05.783
I'm covering this
on top of Gloria.

05:05.783 --> 05:07.089
Give it to the rookie.

05:08.917 --> 05:10.875
- Eileen.
- No.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.921
I didn't even ask
a question.

05:12.921 --> 05:15.315
If it includes human-interest
clickbait, you don't have to.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.665
The Governor's Office
is holding a presser.

05:17.665 --> 05:21.364
I need someone there.
You can do this in your sleep.

05:21.364 --> 05:24.106
This is me
asking for a favor.

05:24.106 --> 05:26.021
Please.

05:26.021 --> 05:27.762
Good morning.

05:27.762 --> 05:29.981
25-year-old
Henley Madison Scott

05:29.981 --> 05:33.376
of Houston, Texas, was
reported missing this morning.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.639
On behalf of Governor Thacker,
I want to extend

05:35.639 --> 05:38.207
our thoughts and prayers
to Henley's family

05:38.207 --> 05:40.078
and commend the efforts
of the Coast Guard

05:40.078 --> 05:42.516
and State Troopers who are
working in tandem to find her.

05:42.516 --> 05:45.693
I will take questions, but
this is an open investigation.

05:45.693 --> 05:47.129
Yes?

05:47.129 --> 05:49.218
Emma Darview,
<i>Juneau Empire.</i>

05:49.218 --> 05:51.002
How large
is the search radius?

05:51.002 --> 05:55.050
At this time, the maritime
search is 70 nautical miles.

05:55.050 --> 05:57.095
Ria Critchfield,
<i>Ketchikan Daily News.</i>

05:57.095 --> 06:00.011
How long do they expect she can
stay alive in the water?

06:00.011 --> 06:03.493
The estimated time of survival
is six hours in those waters.

06:03.493 --> 06:06.191
So she's been in the water
now approximately how long?

06:06.191 --> 06:08.716
I'm sorry. You are...?Oh, sorry.

06:08.716 --> 06:11.153
Uh, Eileen Fitzgerald,
<i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

06:11.153 --> 06:14.548
Henley's been missing
for almost six hours.

06:14.548 --> 06:16.201
And how extensive
is the search?

06:16.201 --> 06:18.421
Several Jayhawk helicopters
have been deployed,

06:18.421 --> 06:21.206
a response boat
from Station Valdez,

06:21.206 --> 06:23.861
and the Coast Guard cutter <i>Endurance.</i>

06:23.861 --> 06:25.472
That's a big operation.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.256
The Governor
is personally committed

06:27.256 --> 06:30.346
to bringing Henley home,
and no expense will be spared.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.740
That'll be all.

06:40.356 --> 06:42.358
How was the presser?

06:42.358 --> 06:44.142
Big turnout.
Helicopters, search boats.

06:44.142 --> 06:46.623
You name it, they're doing it.
Where we at with Gloria?

06:46.623 --> 06:48.582
I've been trying to track down
drug dealers in Meade.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.758
If Gloria left Skeeter's
looking for Oxy,

06:50.758 --> 06:51.976
she must have talked
to someone.

06:51.976 --> 06:53.804
Any more leads
on Skeeter?

06:53.804 --> 06:56.067
I've got Gabriel scrubbing
social and checking traps.

06:56.067 --> 06:58.200
There's nothing.
This guy is a ghost.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.724
Or really good at hiding.
Keep on him.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.073
How was the presser?

07:02.073 --> 07:04.119
Riveting.

07:04.119 --> 07:05.555
I'll write it up.

07:05.555 --> 07:07.949
Thank you.
Alright, people!

07:07.949 --> 07:10.081
This Henley story
is getting a lot of traction.

07:10.081 --> 07:12.780
The <i>Times,</i> the <i>Post,
USA Today,</i> cable news.

07:12.780 --> 07:14.956
But I don't want to farm you out
as stringers.

07:14.956 --> 07:17.132
How much lead time do we have
before the talking heads fly in?

07:17.132 --> 07:18.699
We have a minute
before they land.

07:18.699 --> 07:22.093
It's a local story,
ours to tell.

07:22.093 --> 07:23.834
Let's tell it first and best.

07:23.834 --> 07:26.315
Doesn't this story reek of
Missing White Woman Syndrome?

07:26.315 --> 07:29.927
Perhaps, but it's eyeballs.
The entire country's watching.

07:29.927 --> 07:31.973
Yeah, but Jade Jacobs
disappeared two days ago,

07:31.973 --> 07:34.149
and you don't see <i>her</i> face
all over the news.

07:34.149 --> 07:36.934
Roz, you know we can't
<i>not</i> tell the Henley story.

07:36.934 --> 07:40.416
Okay, well, can we split up
our manpower a little bit
and not feed the beast?

07:40.416 --> 07:43.071
She's not wrong. Henley's
getting a <i>lot</i> of coverage.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.812
You should have seen
the turnout at the presser.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.422
It'll only get worse
when cable news shows up.

07:46.422 --> 07:48.729
They're gonna drown us
in their coverage.

07:48.729 --> 07:50.557
True, but maybe
there's an angle here.

07:50.557 --> 07:53.951
Two women disappeared.
One white, one Yup'ik.

07:53.951 --> 07:56.301
- A comparison piece?
- I'm down with that.

07:56.301 --> 07:57.738
Me too.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.391
I like it.
Follow the money.

07:59.391 --> 08:01.742
I'll dig into how much
is being spent to find Henley.

08:01.742 --> 08:03.221
I'll do the same
with Jade.

08:03.221 --> 08:05.528
I need hard numbers.
Then it's a story.

08:05.528 --> 08:07.661
I like this idea. Overdue.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.924
It was pretty much
your idea.
Was it?

08:09.924 --> 08:12.404
- Tale of Two Searches.
- Let's do it.

08:18.715 --> 08:21.152
Try and get some shots
in the war room.

08:21.152 --> 08:22.763
Are you gonna try
to get in?

08:22.763 --> 08:25.243
Not gonna happen
with the gate keeper.

08:25.243 --> 08:26.680
Unless I bring lunch.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.291
Ah. Tataki. Nice.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.988
What's Tataki?

08:30.988 --> 08:32.555
It's sushi.
Super fancy.

08:34.252 --> 08:37.038
$2,300 for lunch.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.562
Sorry, ma'am, no press.

08:39.562 --> 08:40.520
So does that mean
no sushi?

08:44.088 --> 08:45.829
Hey. I know her.

08:45.829 --> 08:47.831
Commissioner Haynes,
Public Safety. She's--

08:47.831 --> 08:50.138
Commissioner Haynes,
hi. Eileen Fitzgerald,
<i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

08:50.138 --> 08:52.140
- Hello, Eileen.
- Uh, I was just curious,

08:52.140 --> 08:54.534
how much does it cost to
operate a Jayhawk helicopter?

08:54.534 --> 08:55.970
About $14,000.

08:55.970 --> 08:57.580
A day?

08:57.580 --> 09:00.148
An hour.

09:00.148 --> 09:02.150
Wow.

09:02.150 --> 09:04.065
And how many are being used
to search for Henley?

09:04.065 --> 09:05.893
Three.

09:05.893 --> 09:08.765
And how much does
a Coast Guard cutter cost?

09:08.765 --> 09:10.680
Uh, about 17 grand.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.552
An hour?
Hm.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.816
And we're also using
two C-130 turbo-prop planes.

09:15.816 --> 09:17.339
And how much
does that run you?

09:17.339 --> 09:18.949
Oh, about $18,000.

09:18.949 --> 09:21.212
Just to say it,
we are sparing no expense

09:21.212 --> 09:22.474
to find this young woman.

09:22.474 --> 09:25.695
That's--
that's great.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.610
So all-in, how much
would you say

09:27.610 --> 09:29.699
that this search
is costing you?

09:29.699 --> 09:31.701
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd say

09:31.701 --> 09:33.442
somewhere in excess
of a million dollars.

09:33.442 --> 09:34.661
A million dollars.

09:36.488 --> 09:39.013
That's, uh, a lot of money.

09:39.013 --> 09:41.363
Well, when the Governor said
spare no expense, he meant it.

09:41.363 --> 09:42.582
Excuse me.

09:47.108 --> 09:47.978
Enjoy.

09:47.978 --> 09:50.285
Thank you so much.
Mm-hmm.

09:53.331 --> 09:55.203
Ken.
Stan.

09:55.203 --> 09:57.074
What do you got for me?

09:57.074 --> 10:00.425
Well, the Pritchards
keep their noses pretty clean.

10:00.425 --> 10:03.777
So... there's no connection
between them and Frank Moses?

10:03.777 --> 10:05.387
I didn't say that.

10:10.435 --> 10:12.046
What am I looking at?

10:12.046 --> 10:14.265
The Pritchards own
a development firm

10:14.265 --> 10:16.572
that bought up several parcels
of land across the state.

10:16.572 --> 10:18.443
And why would they
do that?

10:19.836 --> 10:21.446
You see how they're all
next to each other?

10:21.446 --> 10:22.622
Uh-huh.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.971
I think they're
building a road.

10:23.971 --> 10:26.626
A road to where?

10:26.626 --> 10:27.888
That's the question.

10:27.888 --> 10:30.064
This land is protected.

10:31.674 --> 10:34.459
And if it wasn't protected,
how much would it be worth?

10:34.459 --> 10:36.331
I'm not sure.

10:36.331 --> 10:38.463
But if Conrad Pritchard
is interested in it...

10:41.205 --> 10:42.685
...I'll keep digging.

10:44.905 --> 10:46.515
Thanks.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.009
Aaron.

11:02.009 --> 11:03.924
Stanley.

11:03.924 --> 11:06.404
Good to see you. To what
do I owe the pleasure?

11:06.404 --> 11:08.624
The quarterly reports
just came in.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.800
And they aren't great,
I take it?

11:10.800 --> 11:13.107
No.
Subscriptions are down.

11:13.107 --> 11:16.240
Wondering if you had any insight
on how to get them back up.

11:16.240 --> 11:19.069
You know, this cruise-ship story
is getting a lot of traction.

11:19.069 --> 11:20.549
That could help.

11:20.549 --> 11:22.203
Will it help <i>enough?</i>

11:22.203 --> 11:23.900
Honestly, I don't know.

11:25.032 --> 11:28.209
Can I ask-- are you
getting pressure on this?

11:31.995 --> 11:34.345
I'm here because I'm looking
at the operational numbers

11:34.345 --> 11:36.913
and I don't like
what I see.

11:36.913 --> 11:41.483
But to be clear, <i>I'm</i> the one
driving this, not my father.

11:41.483 --> 11:43.572
I wasn't trying to imply--You weren't?

11:47.141 --> 11:49.839
I want this paper
to work.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.711
You above all people
should know that.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.539
So do your job.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.498
Make it work.

12:03.070 --> 12:04.593
I'll see you in there.

12:06.813 --> 12:07.901
Hey!

12:07.901 --> 12:09.511
Hey.
Glad I caught you.

12:09.511 --> 12:12.775
Listen.
There's this thing tonight.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.995
Uh, a gala. I wondered if maybe
you'd consider--

12:14.995 --> 12:17.345
Yeah, I thought I, uh, made it
clear we're not doing this.

12:18.650 --> 12:22.176
W-W-We are absolutely
not doing <i>that.</i>

12:22.176 --> 12:25.527
I'm not asking you out
on a date.

12:25.527 --> 12:26.876
Strictly a business request.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.399
Okay.

12:28.399 --> 12:30.010
It's a gala
for the arts.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.359
It'd be good for the paper
if you were there.

12:31.359 --> 12:33.753
Yeah, no.
Galas aren't really my jam.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.363
But have fun.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.023
A million dollars?

12:43.023 --> 12:44.720
That's what
the Commissioner said.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.766
I want to go back. I have
some questions for her.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.768
We still need to cover
the actual search, though.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.204
You wanted to see me?
Yes.

12:50.204 --> 12:51.945
Feel like taking
a road trip to Seward?

12:51.945 --> 12:53.642
Ooh, I haven't been
back up there in a while.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.209
Not since
my beautiful <i>Eleanor.</i>

12:55.209 --> 12:57.167
Sounds saucy.
Do tell.

12:57.167 --> 13:00.257
My Phantom. 21-footer.
A perfect boat.

13:00.257 --> 13:01.476
Not saucy.

13:01.476 --> 13:04.696
Mm. She was. Very.
A real beaut.

13:04.696 --> 13:06.568
I need you to cover
the Henley search.

13:06.568 --> 13:09.527
Will do. I got contacts
up in the harbor.

13:09.527 --> 13:11.573
You mind if I take Miles
and Maisie along, get some art?

13:11.573 --> 13:12.835
- They're all yours.
- Who's Maisie?

13:12.835 --> 13:14.010
The drone.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.535
You guys really like
to name things, don't you?

13:27.328 --> 13:30.200
Got your Slack. You're good to
cover the grid search for Jade.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.767
- Thanks.
- But I can't give you Miles.

13:31.767 --> 13:33.160
I need art for my story.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.336
He already left for Seward
with Bob.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.294
Bob? Why?
He's covering
the Henley search.

13:37.294 --> 13:39.296
Don't we have enough art
on the Henley search?

13:39.296 --> 13:41.298
Not <i>ours.</i>
You'll have to make do.

13:41.298 --> 13:42.822
Seems like we're always
"making do"

13:42.822 --> 13:44.824
when it comes to
Missing and Murdered.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.216
Bob got to me first.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.827
Stanley Cornik.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.829
Is that another editor
looking for Henley coverage?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.874
Hello, Steve.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.528
How are things
in Boston?

14:05.018 --> 14:06.410
Your truck's ready
to be picked up?

14:06.410 --> 14:08.238
Yeah.

14:08.238 --> 14:09.544
What's wrong?

14:09.544 --> 14:11.502
Just work.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.591
Eileen?

14:13.591 --> 14:16.333
Believe it or not, no. Stanley.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.944
He won't give me
a photographer.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.771
It's so frustrating.

14:19.771 --> 14:21.512
Aren't you guys always
understaffed, though?

14:21.512 --> 14:24.167
It's just this story.

14:24.167 --> 14:27.997
I want to do it right,
but it's so heavy.

14:27.997 --> 14:31.348
Hey, you're doing your part.
You're making a difference.

14:31.348 --> 14:33.611
Let's go get my camera.
I'll be your photographer.

14:33.611 --> 14:34.743
What happened
to your seminar?

14:36.571 --> 14:38.181
You got the green light?

14:38.181 --> 14:40.183
No more TA'ing.

14:40.183 --> 14:41.924
Just writing
my dissertation.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.578
I'm a free man.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.710
Well, academically.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.887
That's amazing, babe.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.324
So, can I be
your camera boy?

14:50.324 --> 14:52.413
Hell yeah.
Yeah!

14:57.766 --> 15:00.290
Can't say when exactly.

15:00.290 --> 15:03.467
There's no security footage
of the girl falling overboard?

15:03.467 --> 15:05.339
Not that I've seen.

15:05.339 --> 15:09.169
Best we can tell is she was
in an off-limits spot.

15:09.169 --> 15:10.822
No one else was around.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.955
What about
the Man Overboard System?

15:12.955 --> 15:15.566
Radar and infrared didn't
pick her up in the water?

15:15.566 --> 15:17.133
I can't comment on that.

15:18.178 --> 15:19.962
- I'm sorry, Bobby.
- Craig, you're gonna

15:19.962 --> 15:21.485
get reporters here
from all over the country.

15:21.485 --> 15:23.096
You know
<i>I'll</i> do right by you.

15:23.096 --> 15:25.185
Why do you think
I'm standing <i>here?</i>

15:25.185 --> 15:27.491
Then tell me why
the Man Overboard System

15:27.491 --> 15:29.406
didn't detect
the girl in the water.

15:31.669 --> 15:33.193
It was never installed.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.631
But it's the law.
It has to be.

15:36.631 --> 15:39.416
What do you want me
to say?

15:39.416 --> 15:40.940
I gotta get going.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.643
Bob. Check it out.

15:55.911 --> 15:57.608
Can you get in there
closer?

16:00.437 --> 16:03.049
"Panama."

16:03.049 --> 16:04.528
Hmm...

16:15.409 --> 16:17.367
Please remember
to stay arms-length apart.

16:17.367 --> 16:19.717
If you see anything,
stop and call out,

16:19.717 --> 16:20.936
and I'll come to you.

16:20.936 --> 16:23.547
Charlene.
Roz.

16:23.547 --> 16:24.809
<i>Yagheli'du.</i>

16:24.809 --> 16:26.376
<i>Chin'an.</i>

16:26.376 --> 16:30.032
Thank you for being here.
Any exposure will help.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.991
This is Jindaháa.
- He'll be taking photos.
- Nice to meet you.

16:33.818 --> 16:35.211
Have the APD been by?

16:35.211 --> 16:37.126
No.
Only the community.

16:37.126 --> 16:39.128
Jindaháa:
That's not surprising.

16:39.128 --> 16:40.042
How long
has she been missing?

16:40.042 --> 16:41.957
Close to 50 hours.

16:41.957 --> 16:44.655
If we don't find her
in the next day,

16:44.655 --> 16:46.092
it's unlikely
she's gonna be alive.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.311
Is her family here?

16:48.311 --> 16:51.749
Yes. Her mom, Iris, is.
She's over there.

16:51.749 --> 16:53.621
Lots of friends
and family, too.

16:53.621 --> 16:56.580
It's a good turnout.

16:56.580 --> 16:57.799
Can I speak with her?

16:57.799 --> 17:00.280
Yes. Come.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.065
Iris?
This is Roz Friendly.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.588
She's from
the newspaper.

17:04.588 --> 17:06.503
<i>Waqaa.</i>

17:06.503 --> 17:10.290
Mrs. Jacobs, I'm so sorry
for what happened.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.379
Do you know my daughter?

17:12.379 --> 17:14.990
I don't, but with
your permission,

17:14.990 --> 17:17.819
I'd like to write a story saying
what is being done to find her.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.603
Can I ask you
a few questions?

17:24.695 --> 17:26.610
She wouldn't walk off
like this.

17:26.610 --> 17:28.699
That's not who my Jade is.

17:28.699 --> 17:30.049
She's smart.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.486
She has so many friends.

17:32.486 --> 17:35.924
She's a happy g--

17:35.924 --> 17:37.621
She's a happy girl.

17:55.117 --> 17:57.032
Commissioner,
one more question.

17:57.032 --> 17:59.382
Are you just opposed
to pressers?

17:59.382 --> 18:01.950
A little bit, yeah.
It feels, uh, impersonal.

18:01.950 --> 18:04.344
Real quick, were you
aware that while the search
for Henley is going on,

18:04.344 --> 18:06.520
there's another search under way
for Jade Jacobs?

18:06.520 --> 18:09.175
She's an Alaska Native woman
who went missing two days ago.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.046
I don't know
anything about that.

18:11.046 --> 18:13.179
But if a million dollars
was spent to find Jade

18:13.179 --> 18:16.269
and all the other missing
Alaska Native women,

18:16.269 --> 18:18.358
the state
would go bankrupt, right?

18:18.358 --> 18:21.404
I know what you're trying to do
here, but it's not our fault.

18:21.404 --> 18:23.145
It's not your fault?

18:23.145 --> 18:25.408
That we're spending all
this money to find the girl.

18:25.408 --> 18:26.888
Then whose fault is it?

18:26.888 --> 18:28.107
Yours.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.109
What do you mean?

18:30.109 --> 18:31.806
Look around.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.982
Whenever a white girl
goes missing,

18:33.982 --> 18:36.158
my phone blows up
with you people hounding me

18:36.158 --> 18:38.291
to find out what's being done
to find her.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.771
Gotta wonder why there's so much
pressure to find Henley,

18:40.771 --> 18:42.512
but not so much
to find that other girl.

18:42.512 --> 18:43.818
Jade Jacobs.

18:43.818 --> 18:46.212
I think you know why.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.822
You people will
hold us accountable

18:47.822 --> 18:49.171
if we don't find Henley.

18:49.171 --> 18:52.348
But if we don't find Jade?
Not so much.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.710
The cruise company didn't
install the M.O.B. system

19:06.710 --> 19:09.496
because it flies
a Panamanian flag.

19:09.496 --> 19:10.758
So they don't have to
follow U.S. law?

19:10.758 --> 19:12.586
No. And get this--

19:12.586 --> 19:14.849
they don't have to
reimburse the Coast Guard

19:14.849 --> 19:16.198
for the million-dollar search, either.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.504
Then who pays for it?

19:17.504 --> 19:18.635
We do. Taxpayers.

19:18.635 --> 19:20.811
- Hell of a loophole.
- I agree.

19:20.811 --> 19:22.639
I'd like to see what Thacker
has to say about it.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.989
Keep digging. There's
another presser in an hour.

19:24.989 --> 19:27.078
- Another one?
- We did some digging
on Henley.

19:27.078 --> 19:29.255
Turns out she has
two misdemeanors.

19:29.255 --> 19:31.257
A D.U.I. and a possession
charge in Texas.

19:31.257 --> 19:33.172
This just keeps
getting better.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.044
You know who else had
two misdemeanors? Gloria.

19:36.044 --> 19:38.220
Doubt they'll broadcast
Henley's criminal record

19:38.220 --> 19:39.656
like they did Gloria's.

19:39.656 --> 19:42.964
Maybe I'll attend
their next performance.

19:42.964 --> 19:44.922
I'll join you.

19:44.922 --> 19:48.274
I'm asking for help from
everyone to find our daughter.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.189
We need your prayers.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.540
Henley, if you can hear me,
we love you,

19:53.540 --> 19:56.543
and we're doing everything
we can to find you.

19:56.543 --> 19:58.414
Thank you, Mrs. Scott.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.895
We do have a small update.

20:00.895 --> 20:03.071
The Coast Guard
has expanded its search

20:03.071 --> 20:06.248
and is now exploring islands
in the search radius.

20:06.248 --> 20:07.467
I'll take questions.

20:07.467 --> 20:09.338
Oh, uh,
Karl Folkes, NSN.

20:09.338 --> 20:12.254
How much has the search radius
expanded since this morning?

20:12.254 --> 20:15.475
The search radius
is now at 90 nautical miles.

20:15.475 --> 20:17.085
Bob Young,
<i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

20:17.085 --> 20:18.826
Can you explain why there's
no Man Overboard system

20:18.826 --> 20:20.175
on the ship?

20:22.090 --> 20:23.874
Safety is our foremost priority

20:23.874 --> 20:25.746
at Gold Star Cruises International,

20:25.746 --> 20:28.531
but M.O.B. systems have
high rates of false positives.

20:28.531 --> 20:30.446
Ben Morehurst, ANNC--They may be imperfect,

20:30.446 --> 20:32.622
but wouldn't you say the real
reason you didn't install it

20:32.622 --> 20:34.798
is because your flag state
is Panama,

20:34.798 --> 20:37.148
so you don't have to
follow U.S. law?

20:37.148 --> 20:39.977
And is it true Gold Star Cruises
is expensing its operating costs

20:39.977 --> 20:41.762
during the search,
which means it's actually

20:41.762 --> 20:44.199
profiting off of
Henley's disappearance?

20:44.199 --> 20:46.506
Okay, I would like to focus
on the victim here.

20:46.506 --> 20:48.856
Henley is our top priority.

20:48.856 --> 20:50.379
Great. Roz Friendly,
<i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

20:50.379 --> 20:51.815
Can you speak to the fact

20:51.815 --> 20:53.730
that Henley Scott
has a criminal record

20:53.730 --> 20:56.907
and that alcohol was involved
in her disappearance?

20:56.907 --> 20:58.866
I'm not sure why you're
trying to tarnish

20:58.866 --> 21:00.737
the reputation
of an innocent girl,

21:00.737 --> 21:03.566
but your question is
nothing short of victim-blaming,

21:03.566 --> 21:05.264
and it has
no relevance here.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.657
I completely agree.
I'm just confused

21:07.657 --> 21:09.833
why alcohol and criminal records
were included

21:09.833 --> 21:11.705
in state and local
news releases

21:11.705 --> 21:14.490
in these cases of missing
Alaska Native women.

21:14.490 --> 21:16.492
I'm glad
you brought this up.

21:16.492 --> 21:21.192
The MMIW crisis is a serious
issue for Governor Thacker,

21:21.192 --> 21:25.022
so much so that he recently
appointed a task force

21:25.022 --> 21:26.850
specifically dedicated
to the search and rescue

21:26.850 --> 21:28.504
of missing
Indigenous women.

21:28.504 --> 21:29.984
Okay, but can you
answer my question?

21:29.984 --> 21:32.595
I just did. I'll take
another question, please.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.992
- They find Henley yet?
- Nope.

21:37.992 --> 21:39.733
And they're expanding
the search.

21:39.733 --> 21:41.387
It's been, what,
14 hours at this point?

21:41.387 --> 21:42.997
They're probably looking
for a body, right?

21:42.997 --> 21:45.304
- Probably, yes.
- Jade could still be alive.

21:47.131 --> 21:50.178
Does anyone know anything about
the Governor's MMIW task force?

21:50.178 --> 21:53.094
I know when Thacker
wants to bury a problem,
he appoints a task force.

21:53.094 --> 21:55.531
You know how we can get
our hands on the budget
of this task force?

21:55.531 --> 21:57.925
Public funds, public record.
Give me two minutes.

21:57.925 --> 21:59.448
Roz?
Yeah?

21:59.448 --> 22:00.623
I've been asked by
the Governor's office

22:00.623 --> 22:02.016
to "talk to you"
about your behavior

22:02.016 --> 22:03.104
at the press conference.

22:03.104 --> 22:04.540
<i>Your</i> behavior?

22:04.540 --> 22:07.326
I was way out of line.
Kept asking questions.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.503
Well, they're asking that
you be a little more discreet.

22:10.503 --> 22:12.331
Looks like
you touched a nerve.

22:14.420 --> 22:15.464
Are you done
"talking" to me?

22:15.464 --> 22:18.293
I am. Good chat.
Where you going?

22:19.338 --> 22:21.470
Back to the grid search.
For Jade.

22:21.470 --> 22:23.124
I thought
you already covered it.

22:23.124 --> 22:25.169
I did. I wrote it up.

22:25.169 --> 22:26.475
So why are you going back?

22:26.475 --> 22:27.824
She's still missing.

22:32.263 --> 22:33.526
Here are the audited
financial statements.

22:34.744 --> 22:36.398
Thanks.

22:36.398 --> 22:38.400
Looks like it's <i>my</i> turn
to touch a nerve.

22:40.271 --> 22:42.926
I do love
a spreadsheet.

22:42.926 --> 22:45.189
Um...

22:48.062 --> 22:49.846
It seems like
a pretty straightforward

22:49.846 --> 22:51.282
financial statement.

22:51.282 --> 22:53.067
I was hoping you could tell me
what I'm missing.

22:55.025 --> 22:57.680
Okay. Here's something.

22:57.680 --> 23:00.379
What?
Do you see this?

23:00.379 --> 23:02.250
- Yeah.
- Looks like most of the money

23:02.250 --> 23:06.123
is going toward something
called an "Awareness Campaign."

23:06.123 --> 23:08.822
So most of the money
is going towards PR.

23:08.822 --> 23:10.650
Hmm.

23:10.650 --> 23:11.955
"Hmm" what?

23:13.479 --> 23:15.742
All the tax ID
and routing numbers

23:15.742 --> 23:18.092
are for the same company.
It's, uh...

23:18.092 --> 23:20.007
Concordia Public Relations.

23:27.536 --> 23:29.451
You gotta be
kidding me.

23:29.451 --> 23:30.800
What?

23:30.800 --> 23:33.281
Anchorage
<i>is</i> a small town.

23:33.281 --> 23:35.718
I told you.

23:37.285 --> 23:38.852
I was thinking about
what you said earlier.

23:40.984 --> 23:42.812
How are you keeping track
of all the Missing?

23:42.812 --> 23:44.945
We put the calls from the
tip line into a spreadsheet.

23:44.945 --> 23:48.035
And what are you doing with it?
I mean, besides gathering data.

23:48.035 --> 23:49.645
What do you mean?

23:49.645 --> 23:52.431
Well, a spreadsheet's
just a spreadsheet.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.563
How are you visualizing it
for your readers?

23:54.563 --> 23:57.610
Roll-over maps?
An interactive visual treatment?

23:57.610 --> 23:59.612
Are you nerding out on me
right now, Dr. CompSci?

23:59.612 --> 24:01.265
Indeed I am.

24:01.265 --> 24:03.267
Roz!
Hey.

24:03.267 --> 24:05.052
What are you
doing here?

24:05.052 --> 24:08.272
Uh, I'd like
to be of service.

24:08.272 --> 24:09.709
Oh, thank you.

24:09.709 --> 24:11.711
Stanley.
Jindaháa.

24:11.711 --> 24:13.887
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Good to see you again.

24:18.108 --> 24:19.327
Hello?

24:19.327 --> 24:20.676
Hey. Where are you?

24:20.676 --> 24:22.069
<i>At Jade's search.</i>

24:22.069 --> 24:23.549
You talk
to the police there?

24:23.549 --> 24:25.507
Police?
What police?

24:25.507 --> 24:27.335
Not one cop there, huh?

24:27.335 --> 24:29.293
<i>Where's the Governor's
task force?</i>

24:29.293 --> 24:31.165
They're not here.
Stanley is, though.

24:31.165 --> 24:32.471
I'll put you on speaker.

24:34.081 --> 24:35.691
The more I learn
about this task force,

24:35.691 --> 24:37.563
the more Thacker
has to answer for.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.695
What'd you find? <i>I'll fill you in later.</i>

24:39.695 --> 24:41.567
You call the Governor's office
for comment?

24:41.567 --> 24:44.178
<i>Mm-hmm. Yeah.
I got the runaround.</i>

24:44.178 --> 24:46.485
His schedule is public record
but only <i>after</i> the fact.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.705
His rep told me she'll tell me
tomorrow where he is today.

24:49.705 --> 24:52.055
Likely he's going
to the gala.

24:52.055 --> 24:53.100
<i>What gala?</i>

24:53.100 --> 24:54.449
Governor's Arts Gala.
Big photo op.

24:54.449 --> 24:57.539
Funny. I was thinking
of going to that.

24:57.539 --> 24:58.671
I'll call you back.

24:58.671 --> 25:00.890
She's going to the gala?

25:00.890 --> 25:02.501
Full of surprises,
that one.

25:02.501 --> 25:05.112
Hey!
I found something!

25:05.112 --> 25:06.330
Don't touch it!
I'm coming!

25:08.594 --> 25:09.551
That's Jade's bracelet.

25:12.336 --> 25:15.252
That means she could be
close by, right?

25:15.252 --> 25:18.125
We gotta keep moving!
Everybody, let's go!

25:43.629 --> 25:46.806
Ms. Fitzgerald.
You clean up nice.

25:46.806 --> 25:49.417
You clean up even nicer.

25:49.417 --> 25:50.897
Thanks for allowing
for my change of heart.

25:52.115 --> 25:54.509
When it works in my favor, always.

25:54.509 --> 25:56.380
Curious.

25:56.380 --> 25:57.686
What changed your mind?

25:57.686 --> 26:00.950
Felt like dressing up.

26:00.950 --> 26:02.561
Is the Governor here yet?

26:02.561 --> 26:05.041
I haven't seen him yet.
Champagne?

26:06.913 --> 26:11.961
Hey, Claire. How's, uh, life
at <i>The Daily Alaskan?</i>

26:11.961 --> 26:14.616
Stanley still got you
grinding away at the Mayhem?

26:14.616 --> 26:17.010
Hey, Dennis.
How's the blog?

26:17.010 --> 26:20.056
That's funny.

26:20.056 --> 26:23.930
I think they do these buffets
for us journos.

26:23.930 --> 26:26.280
Yeah. Funny.
Mm! Good.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.196
See ya, Claire!

26:32.242 --> 26:34.157
Eileen.

26:34.157 --> 26:37.073
Jamie.
What are you doing here?

26:37.073 --> 26:38.858
Uh, well, it's a little
embarrassing, actually,

26:38.858 --> 26:40.642
but I'm getting
an award.

26:40.642 --> 26:43.253
Well, that's great.
For being a pilot?

26:43.253 --> 26:45.647
Uh, no.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.823
Um, for my
new collection.

26:47.823 --> 26:49.042
Congratulations.

26:50.260 --> 26:52.654
Oh, uh, Aaron, Jamie.
Jamie, Aaron.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.047
Congratulations.

26:54.047 --> 26:55.614
Yeah, thanks a lot.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.267
Uh, I don't really know
if I believe in awards,

26:57.267 --> 26:59.182
but it felt rude
to say no

26:59.182 --> 27:01.097
and I could certainly
use the dough.

27:01.097 --> 27:02.272
Plane repairs?

27:02.272 --> 27:03.883
New rotor kit, actually.

27:03.883 --> 27:04.884
What do you fly?

27:04.884 --> 27:06.581
A Beaver.

27:06.581 --> 27:08.931
Ohh. I love those planes.
Super fun.

27:08.931 --> 27:10.280
I had one
when I was a kid.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.239
I still have mine.

27:13.544 --> 27:16.199
Very nice to meet you, Aaron.
I should go prepare.

27:16.199 --> 27:18.332
I'm, uh, doing
a reading later.

27:20.203 --> 27:21.509
Old friend?

27:21.509 --> 27:24.381
New, old. Yeah.

27:24.381 --> 27:27.254
Seems cool.
I'm glad he won the award.

27:27.254 --> 27:29.952
My father
actually funded it.

27:29.952 --> 27:31.998
Wow.

27:31.998 --> 27:34.217
- Is your father here?
- He is.

27:34.217 --> 27:35.784
I'd love to meet him.

27:39.266 --> 27:41.442
Hey. I just looked
at Jindaháa's photos.

27:41.442 --> 27:43.487
They're good.
Thank him for me.

27:43.487 --> 27:46.012
I will. Thanks again
for coming tonight.

27:46.012 --> 27:47.796
I'm glad I did.

27:47.796 --> 27:50.016
But just to say it,

27:50.016 --> 27:52.714
I'm never really trying

27:52.714 --> 27:56.718
to short shrift your work here,
Roz, or anyone else's.

27:56.718 --> 28:00.417
I don't play favorites.
I just have limited resources.

28:00.417 --> 28:03.725
I know. It's just
frustrating sometimes.

28:03.725 --> 28:04.987
Trust me, I know.

28:04.987 --> 28:06.902
Quite frankly,
it's embarrassing

28:06.902 --> 28:09.122
not being able to
support you guys properly.

28:09.122 --> 28:10.297
It pisses me off.

28:10.297 --> 28:13.213
Well, if I'm being honest,

28:13.213 --> 28:14.954
it kinda makes me happy
that it does.

28:14.954 --> 28:17.913
You think I got these wrinkles
from smiling?

28:17.913 --> 28:19.741
Ah.

28:19.741 --> 28:21.830
You think Jindaháa was serious
about turning our data

28:21.830 --> 28:24.964
from the tip line
into a visual treatment?

28:24.964 --> 28:26.835
Very serious.

28:26.835 --> 28:29.359
It could really show people
the scale of this crisis,

28:29.359 --> 28:30.970
put a human face on it.

28:30.970 --> 28:33.494
Can you have him do a mock-up
of the design?

28:33.494 --> 28:35.365
I'll take it to Pritchard,
try to get some money.

28:35.365 --> 28:36.627
Really?

28:36.627 --> 28:38.455
Yeah, really. Why?

28:38.760 --> 28:41.676
Nothing.
Thanks, Stanley.

28:41.676 --> 28:43.025
Hm.

28:51.468 --> 28:54.689
Dad, meet
Eileen Fitzgerald.

28:54.689 --> 28:57.779
Ah, the new star
of <i>The Alaskan.</i>

28:57.779 --> 28:59.041
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Pritchard.

28:59.041 --> 29:02.784
Conrad. Please.

29:02.784 --> 29:05.961
Aaron can't stop raving
about your work.

29:05.961 --> 29:10.009
That, uh, piece on the Meade
Police Chief was excellent.

29:10.009 --> 29:11.880
Agreed.
Thank you.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.534
I understand that
you're the director

29:13.534 --> 29:15.362
of Concordia
Public Relations.

29:15.362 --> 29:17.799
It's a small piece
of my portfolio.

29:17.799 --> 29:19.583
Well, did you know
that 85% of the budget

29:19.583 --> 29:21.585
for the Governor's
MMIW Task Force

29:21.585 --> 29:23.762
went to Concordia
for a PR campaign?

29:23.762 --> 29:24.980
I did not.

29:26.590 --> 29:28.418
Are we on the record?

29:28.418 --> 29:30.464
Until you say otherwise.

29:32.205 --> 29:34.468
I'll tell you what.
I'd be happy to put you in touch

29:34.468 --> 29:36.557
with our Director
of Communications.

29:36.557 --> 29:39.865
Just a thought-- that money
could probably be more helpful

29:39.865 --> 29:42.563
funding <i>actual</i> searches
for missing women.

29:45.348 --> 29:48.134
You'll excuse me,
Ms. Fitzgerald.

29:48.134 --> 29:49.526
Son.

29:53.052 --> 29:54.270
The hell was that?

29:54.270 --> 29:56.403
That was me doing my job.

29:56.403 --> 29:57.839
You accepted
my invitation

29:57.839 --> 30:00.624
so that you could
chew out my father?

30:00.624 --> 30:03.366
Were you aware that's how your
family makes some of its money?

30:05.107 --> 30:10.547
The next time you want to use me
to embarrass my old man...

30:10.547 --> 30:11.984
give me a heads-up first.

30:20.209 --> 30:22.777
We covered potholes three
months ago. I wouldn't do it.

30:22.777 --> 30:24.605
Yeah, and it was
a snoozer then.

30:24.605 --> 30:27.695
Okay. Drop the pothole idea.
Another pitch.

30:27.695 --> 30:29.436
So, the Office
of Child Services

30:29.436 --> 30:31.438
is violating parents'
rights by not--

30:31.438 --> 30:33.701
No. You can't toe dip that.
You'll be on that for 6 months.

30:33.701 --> 30:35.398
Agreed. It's a project,
not a story.

30:35.398 --> 30:38.445
Okay. What about this?
So, my friend Lisa

30:38.445 --> 30:40.055
works at the Anchorage
Museum of Modern Art.

30:40.055 --> 30:42.057
She told me that they're
replacing the curator

30:42.057 --> 30:44.625
with someone from Minnesota.
I want to profile her.

30:44.625 --> 30:46.061
That's an
off-the-news feature.

30:46.061 --> 30:48.498
Agreed.
What's the news?

30:48.498 --> 30:50.196
What do you mean?

30:50.196 --> 30:52.241
So if the head curator
was replaced, what happened?

30:53.286 --> 30:54.940
I have no idea.

30:54.940 --> 30:57.377
Exactly. There might be
a good story there.

30:57.377 --> 31:00.162
Yeah, find out what went down.
If it's any good, pitch that.

31:01.381 --> 31:04.036
And, Gabriel, if it turns out
the last curator was let go

31:04.036 --> 31:07.735
because he was also an
eco-terrorist, I will kill you.

31:07.735 --> 31:09.998
Yeah. Me too.

31:13.915 --> 31:18.572
♪ Unani imarpigmiqa

31:18.572 --> 31:20.269
Hey, you know
this area's reserved

31:20.269 --> 31:21.618
for award winners, right?

31:23.403 --> 31:24.578
How's the poem?

31:24.578 --> 31:26.449
About to find out.

31:26.449 --> 31:27.886
Tonight's
the maiden voyage.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.192
Haven't heard from you
in a while.

31:30.192 --> 31:33.587
Uh, yeah.
I gu-- I guess I just figured

31:33.587 --> 31:35.676
you weren't interested
in seeing anyone.

31:35.676 --> 31:37.069
I was wrong, apparently.

31:39.071 --> 31:41.334
He seems like
a nice guy.

31:43.118 --> 31:44.598
He's alright.

31:44.598 --> 31:46.121
He's also my boss.

31:46.121 --> 31:48.123
That sounds tricky.

31:48.123 --> 31:50.125
Not really.
We're not together.

31:50.125 --> 31:52.519
I'm here for work.

31:52.519 --> 31:54.434
Does he know that?

31:54.434 --> 31:57.306
Jamie? You're up.

31:57.306 --> 31:59.178
I'm up.

32:09.797 --> 32:11.190
"Say mountain
when you mean memory."

32:13.801 --> 32:16.760
By honor of the woods,
she remains.

32:16.760 --> 32:19.894
In the hull of lost things--

32:19.894 --> 32:23.985
Her face, open like the neck
of sweet August nettle

32:23.985 --> 32:26.553
Like her, they take on light,

32:26.553 --> 32:28.859
Like fog off the lake--

32:28.859 --> 32:32.428
As the sun bends its way

32:32.428 --> 32:33.995
around another valley;

32:33.995 --> 32:37.651
What I took was flight

32:37.651 --> 32:39.958
Like a bird, I chose sky.

32:41.742 --> 32:43.004
She chose night.

32:50.577 --> 32:51.839
Alright, well,
thank you so much.

32:53.493 --> 32:55.582
Hi.
Hi.

32:55.582 --> 32:56.975
That was lovely.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.890
Yeah? Thank you.

33:02.328 --> 33:04.852
Do you think we could,
uh, start over, maybe?

33:06.767 --> 33:08.464
Eileen Fitzgerald.

33:08.464 --> 33:10.379
Jamie Goodwin.
Poet pilot.

33:10.379 --> 33:14.035
I am a fan of your work,
Mr. Poet Pilot.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.645
Ah, that's so crazy
because I'm actually

33:15.645 --> 33:17.169
a huge fan of yours,
as well.

33:22.435 --> 33:25.481
I'm really sorry.
I will be right back.

33:32.053 --> 33:33.533
Excuse me. Governor.

33:33.533 --> 33:35.187
Eileen Fitzgerald,
<i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

33:35.187 --> 33:36.449
It's an honor
to meet you.

33:36.449 --> 33:37.928
It's nice to meet you.

33:37.928 --> 33:39.626
It's great to see
so many resources

33:39.626 --> 33:41.628
being employed to find
Henley Scott.

33:41.628 --> 33:44.457
Such a shame what happened,
but I am hopeful we'll find her.

33:44.457 --> 33:46.894
I am, too,
but why is it that taxpayers

33:46.894 --> 33:49.070
should foot the bill
for the search?

33:49.070 --> 33:51.290
Shouldn't the cruise companies
be held responsible?

33:51.290 --> 33:53.074
It's a complicated issue.

33:53.074 --> 33:55.120
The cruise industry is a vital
part of the Alaska economy.

33:55.120 --> 33:58.079
We want to support
our partners where we can.

33:58.079 --> 34:00.342
Besides, you can't put
a price on life.

34:00.342 --> 34:03.606
Actually, you have.
One million dollars.

34:03.606 --> 34:05.565
That's how much is being spent
to find Henley.

34:05.565 --> 34:07.262
And every life
is valuable.

34:07.262 --> 34:10.352
To that point, an Alaska Native
woman named Jade Jacobs

34:10.352 --> 34:12.137
is currently missing,
and the amount of money

34:12.137 --> 34:15.792
spent to find her is less than
your interagency's sushi lunch.

34:15.792 --> 34:17.620
If you got your facts straight,
you would know

34:17.620 --> 34:19.622
that I appointed
a task force

34:19.622 --> 34:21.798
specifically dedicated
to the MMIW crisis.

34:21.798 --> 34:24.018
I've been digging
into that task force.

34:24.018 --> 34:26.847
I'm just curious, why is it
that the budget is primarily

34:26.847 --> 34:30.242
going to a PR campaign
and not to saving lives?

34:31.286 --> 34:32.896
Look, I know you came
to this fancy event

34:32.896 --> 34:34.333
with a lot of
gotcha questions,

34:34.333 --> 34:36.117
but this is more complicated
than you know.

34:36.117 --> 34:38.250
What you're talking about
is apples and oranges.

34:38.250 --> 34:39.729
Governor, can you tell me

34:39.729 --> 34:42.123
who are the apples
and who are the oranges?

34:42.123 --> 34:44.647
I have nothing more
to say.

34:44.647 --> 34:47.346
Okay, but we are publishing
a story on the disparity

34:47.346 --> 34:49.130
in the search
and rescue efforts,

34:49.130 --> 34:51.828
so if you think
of something to say,

34:51.828 --> 34:53.482
I'm available
for your comment.

35:01.229 --> 35:03.231
Damn it, Dennis.

35:03.231 --> 35:05.668
Looks like Eileen was
the belle of the ball.

35:05.668 --> 35:07.844
You could say that.
Good work on the Governor.

35:07.844 --> 35:08.932
Seemed like fun.

35:08.932 --> 35:10.369
Looked for you.
I didn't see you.

35:10.369 --> 35:11.848
You're the talk of the town.

35:11.848 --> 35:13.546
Just doing my job.

35:17.724 --> 35:19.421
Can I talk to you
for a sec?

35:19.421 --> 35:22.076
- What's up?
- It's none of my business,

35:22.076 --> 35:24.383
but if, um,
if you're not careful,

35:24.383 --> 35:25.819
people are gonna notice.

35:25.819 --> 35:27.429
Notice what?

35:27.429 --> 35:28.604
Don't get me wrong.

35:28.604 --> 35:30.606
I-I don't care.
But people gossip.

35:30.606 --> 35:32.826
What are we
talking about?

35:32.826 --> 35:35.176
You and Aaron Pritchard.

35:35.176 --> 35:37.961
Nothing happened.

35:37.961 --> 35:40.747
But I appreciate you giving me
the benefit of the doubt.

35:44.707 --> 35:47.449
Thanks again for coming
and sharing Jade's story.

35:47.449 --> 35:49.103
What happens now?

35:49.103 --> 35:50.452
I'll read you the story
before it gets published

35:50.452 --> 35:52.411
to make sure everything
is accurate.

35:52.411 --> 35:55.196
And in the meantime, if you
think of anything I need to add,

35:55.196 --> 35:56.197
just call me.

35:59.505 --> 36:02.464
It's been 72 hours.

36:02.464 --> 36:04.640
I want to believe
that she'll come home.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.251
But what if she doesn't?

36:13.301 --> 36:14.868
They found
the blond girl's body.

36:18.872 --> 36:20.395
NSN Anchor:
The nation held its breath

36:20.395 --> 36:22.397
during this
seemingly endless search,

36:22.397 --> 36:24.704
hoping against hope
the Coast Guard

36:24.704 --> 36:28.447
would find Henley Scott
in these frigid waters.

36:28.447 --> 36:31.928
<i>And earlier today,
human remains were discovered</i>

36:31.928 --> 36:34.322
<i>that are consistent
with her description.</i>

36:34.322 --> 36:36.281
<i>Now the nation
will collectively mourn</i>

36:36.281 --> 36:38.152
<i>the loss of a 25-year-old woman</i>

36:38.152 --> 36:40.198
<i>who disappeared
from a cruise ship</i>

36:40.198 --> 36:41.938
<i>off the coast of Alaska.</i>

37:05.788 --> 37:07.181
Excellent.

37:23.893 --> 37:26.461
Two things, people!

37:26.461 --> 37:30.422
First, one of our subscribers
tweeted this.

37:30.422 --> 37:33.425
<i>"The Daily Alaskan</i> nailed it.

37:33.425 --> 37:36.776
This story wasn't about the
search for one missing woman,

37:36.776 --> 37:40.606
but why one woman's life
is valued more than another's."

37:40.606 --> 37:42.260
I couldn't agree more.

37:42.260 --> 37:45.480
By the way, the <i>Times</i> and <i>Post</i>

37:45.480 --> 37:47.177
are picking up our stories.

37:47.177 --> 37:48.918
Not because we were first--
we weren't--

37:48.918 --> 37:50.442
but because we told it best.

37:50.442 --> 37:52.705
Congrats.

37:52.705 --> 37:55.882
Second,
I'd like to buy you all

37:55.882 --> 37:59.146
a well-deserved drink
after work at the Beard.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.456
Powerful stuff, you two.
Excellent reporting.

38:04.456 --> 38:06.066
Thanks, Bob.
You too.

38:06.066 --> 38:08.460
I might have something
on the Gloria Nanmac story.

38:08.460 --> 38:10.375
I didn't write the story
when she went missing,

38:10.375 --> 38:11.985
but I did write the folo,
when they found her body.

38:11.985 --> 38:13.813
I know. We read it.

38:14.814 --> 38:18.208
I wanted to dig deeper,
but I was on Mayhem.

38:18.208 --> 38:19.253
I had to move on.

38:19.253 --> 38:20.776
We get it, Bob.

38:20.776 --> 38:22.387
Yeah.

38:22.387 --> 38:24.214
Well...

38:24.214 --> 38:27.087
What you wrote about, uh,
the search for Jade reminded me

38:27.087 --> 38:29.437
of a conversation I had
with a young woman up in Meade.

38:29.437 --> 38:31.874
She described how
the community came together

38:31.874 --> 38:33.267
when the police didn't.

38:33.267 --> 38:34.877
I never circled back.

38:34.877 --> 38:36.662
Her name
was Alice Porter.

38:37.837 --> 38:39.534
Who is she?

38:39.534 --> 38:42.668
A friend of Gloria's,
from church I believe.

38:44.191 --> 38:47.542
Gloria went to church?
Sylvie never mentioned <i>that.</i>

38:47.542 --> 38:49.327
No, she didn't.

38:50.415 --> 38:51.851
Hope it helps.

38:51.851 --> 38:53.635
Hey, Bob.

38:55.681 --> 38:58.292
It takes a lot to push
on your old work.

38:58.292 --> 38:59.424
We appreciate it.

39:05.821 --> 39:08.041
Spoke to Alice Porter.

39:08.041 --> 39:09.303
That was quick.

39:09.303 --> 39:11.131
She confirmed
that she and Gloria

39:11.131 --> 39:13.394
knew each other from church,
but there's something else.

39:13.394 --> 39:17.093
The pastor's name
is Reed Gallahorn.

39:17.093 --> 39:18.399
Why does that
sound familiar?

39:18.399 --> 39:20.445
Because...

39:20.445 --> 39:22.011
it sounds like
"Rega Horne,"

39:22.011 --> 39:24.144
the other name
on the police report.

39:24.144 --> 39:27.626
You think "Rega Horne" is
a misspelling of Reed Gallahorn?

39:27.626 --> 39:29.323
Could be.

39:29.323 --> 39:33.501
And if so, why is a pastor's
name on a police report?

39:33.501 --> 39:36.417
Only one way to find out.

39:36.417 --> 39:38.376
Hey, superstars.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.508
You ladies wanna rest on your
laurels over at the Beard?

39:40.508 --> 39:42.858
Bob, Claire, and Stanley
are holding a booth.

39:42.858 --> 39:44.860
Go ahead.
I'll join you in a bit.

39:44.860 --> 39:46.993
- You sure?
- Yeah. I got this.

39:46.993 --> 39:49.299
Just make sure you save a seat
for me next to Bob.

39:55.088 --> 39:57.264
Ugh. Let's just
take the awning.

39:57.264 --> 39:59.832
No. I'm gonna make a run
for it. See ya!

39:59.832 --> 40:02.138
Same.
Last one in, buys!

40:04.140 --> 40:05.925
Whoo! Austin Teague,
still undefeated.

40:19.591 --> 40:22.855
<i>Any chance you're free
for a drink tonight?</i>

40:22.855 --> 40:25.118
<i>Or is this too soon
and I'm not being cool?</i>

40:25.118 --> 40:27.425
I'm not a big fan
of cool.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.992
A drink sounds nice,
but I gotta rain check.

40:29.992 --> 40:32.604
My, uh, colleagues--
I promised them a drink.

40:32.604 --> 40:34.823
<i>Look at you
being a team player.</i>

40:34.823 --> 40:37.391
<i>Good for you.
I'll take the rain check.</i>

40:39.915 --> 40:43.484
Well, it's a short-term
rain check,

40:43.484 --> 40:45.965
so be sure
you cash it in soon.

40:45.965 --> 40:47.096
<i>Good night, Eileen.</i>

40:47.096 --> 40:48.271
Night, Jamie.
