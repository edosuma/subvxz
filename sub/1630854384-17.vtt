that picture!

00:38.197 --> 00:39.598

00:40.366 --> 00:42.568

that's why!

00:42.568 --> 00:43.869
-You didn't?
-No!

00:43.869 --> 00:45.204

00:54.780 --> 00:55.814
No...

00:55.814 --> 00:56.849
She hugged me.

00:57.383 --> 00:58.917
And why would she do that?

00:58.917 --> 01:01.253
I was walkin' out,
and she hugged me

01:01.253 --> 01:02.654

01:07.760 --> 01:08.794
What, Zac?

01:10.028 --> 01:11.764

01:12.297 --> 01:14.166

01:14.166 --> 01:16.368
-No, she didn't.
-Yes, she did.

01:17.236 --> 01:18.604
She did this shit on purpose,

01:18.604 --> 01:20.372
so that she could get somebody
to send you a picture!

01:20.372 --> 01:22.207
Zac, she didn't send me this!

01:22.207 --> 01:23.909
How, how do you--
Then who sent it, then?

01:23.909 --> 01:25.210
Don't worry about that.

How you gonna tell me not
to worry about it,

01:27.212 --> 01:29.314

She's doin' this on purpose!

listening to me?

01:36.955 --> 01:38.290
I am listening to you!

01:38.290 --> 01:40.192

I didn't kiss her!

01:40.192 --> 01:41.160

-You know what?
-Okay, no, no, no, no.

01:43.629 --> 01:45.798
So at what point did
she decide to hug you?

01:47.166 --> 01:48.567
When I was leaving!

01:48.567 --> 01:50.536
That's why I'm tellin' you

That's why she was nice to me!

02:02.414 --> 02:04.016

it to you!

Come on, now.

Oh, from the bank.

04:08.700 --> 04:09.834

Where he implied that

people like that.

However...

07:27.732 --> 07:28.866

You would just be...

07:31.269 --> 07:32.904

07:32.904 --> 07:35.773
and it's not like you would
actually lose anything.

07:38.075 --> 07:39.977

But...

09:54.245 --> 09:56.113
It's gotta be in cash, and...

09:57.048 --> 09:58.049
I know.

09:59.383 --> 10:01.752
And that's way more than
what I have.

10:51.068 --> 10:52.903
My dad said he'll
put his house up.

10:54.805 --> 10:56.640
They won't take that.

10:57.274 --> 10:58.576
--!

10:59.743 --> 11:01.812
Why did he have to hook up
with this dude?

11:01.812 --> 11:03.647
Have you heard from Que?

11:03.647 --> 11:04.815
Hell no.

11:07.785 --> 11:09.587
I'm glad, but...

11:10.721 --> 11:12.389
We gotta do something about him.

11:12.389 --> 11:13.724
Yeah, I know.

11:14.592 --> 11:15.559
He's awful.

11:15.860 --> 11:17.328
Tell me about it.

11:18.129 --> 11:19.296
Oh, shit...

11:19.296 --> 11:20.531
What?

11:20.531 --> 11:22.199
I just realized Maurice's car
is gone.

11:23.367 --> 11:24.635
Que stole his car?

11:24.635 --> 11:25.936
He drives it all the time,

11:25.936 --> 11:27.371
he parks it in front of
the house so

11:27.371 --> 11:29.874
he won't go to jail,
and he also sleeps in it.

11:31.742 --> 11:33.711
-Shit...
-He's a menace.

11:36.447 --> 11:38.249
We gotta do something.

11:39.316 --> 11:40.918
This is so frustrating.

11:42.253 --> 11:43.154
I know.

11:45.489 --> 11:48.359
[crickets chirping]

11:48.359 --> 11:49.327
[knocking on door]

11:49.327 --> 11:50.628
[Robin]<i> Hey, it's Robin.</i>

11:50.628 --> 11:51.729
Come in!

11:54.098 --> 11:55.700
-Hey.
-Hi.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.001
You leavin'?

11:57.001 --> 11:57.802
I am.

11:58.569 --> 12:00.571
All right, well, I just wanted
to say thank you again.

12:00.571 --> 12:02.273
Sure.

12:02.273 --> 12:04.108
And thank you for help with
my friend.

12:04.575 --> 12:05.643
Yeah.

12:07.311 --> 12:08.346
Oh, hey...

12:08.346 --> 12:09.847
Have you had dinner?

12:11.315 --> 12:12.283
"Oh, hey"?

12:12.717 --> 12:13.951
Like you...

12:13.951 --> 12:15.553
That thought just
never crossed your mind?

12:15.553 --> 12:17.254
Until just now, this moment?

12:17.254 --> 12:18.622
It's just dinner.

12:18.622 --> 12:20.558
I have a reservation at
the Steam Plant.

12:20.558 --> 12:22.293
Robin...

12:22.293 --> 12:24.161
That, that can't happen.

12:25.429 --> 12:27.531
I don't see why we can't just
have dinner, right?

12:27.531 --> 12:29.333
We work together, it's fine!

12:30.034 --> 12:31.969
As I said before...

12:32.970 --> 12:35.473
-You wanna keep it professional.
-[Andi] Yes.

12:35.473 --> 12:36.674
Blah, blah, blah.
Okay.

12:38.743 --> 12:40.811
Tellin' you guys to -- off
in the morning.

12:40.811 --> 12:42.813
-Really?
-[Robin] Mm-hm.

12:42.813 --> 12:45.549
Do you mind waiting until I get
into work to do it?

12:45.883 --> 12:47.752
-Oh, I can do that.
-Oh, good.

12:47.752 --> 12:49.820
I just wanna see the look
on their faces.

12:52.456 --> 12:54.425
All right, listen.
I'm gonna be at the Steam Plant.

12:55.126 --> 12:59.530
If you wanna stop by and have
a drink with the guy you owe...

12:59.530 --> 13:01.866
Two major favors to...

13:01.866 --> 13:04.268
Then I think that would be fine.

13:06.303 --> 13:08.038
Okay, fine!

13:08.439 --> 13:11.542
I will come by and have...

13:11.842 --> 13:13.077
One drink.

13:14.578 --> 13:15.946
I'll take it.

13:16.847 --> 13:17.982
Then I'm going home.

13:18.649 --> 13:19.850
Thank you.

13:19.850 --> 13:21.018
[Andi] Okay.

13:21.285 --> 13:22.386
I'll see you there?

13:22.386 --> 13:24.722
Oh, you know, I have my keys
right here.

13:26.257 --> 13:27.258
Do you wanna...

13:27.258 --> 13:28.359
Ride together?

13:28.359 --> 13:29.994
I can drive myself.

13:31.328 --> 13:32.863
Okay, boundaries.

13:34.598 --> 13:36.867
Go now!
I have to get home.

13:36.867 --> 13:38.169
All right.
I'll see you there.

13:38.169 --> 13:39.270
[Andi] Bye.

13:45.643 --> 13:51.782
[music]

13:55.953 --> 13:58.389
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:59.590 --> 14:00.524
[Preston] How was your day?

14:01.892 --> 14:03.160
Unbelievable.

14:04.261 --> 14:06.297
You wouldn't believe
the most amazing customers.

14:06.297 --> 14:07.331
Just...

14:07.331 --> 14:08.466
The usual?

14:08.466 --> 14:09.600
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

14:09.934 --> 14:12.369
Well, I cooked, so...

14:12.369 --> 14:14.071
I can smell it.

14:14.071 --> 14:15.039
Yeah.

14:16.607 --> 14:17.842
It's good...

14:19.844 --> 14:22.379
Funny, I had this dream
that you were leavin'.

14:22.379 --> 14:24.982
On a midnight train to
Tuscaloosa.

14:25.349 --> 14:27.017
Yeah, about that...

14:29.153 --> 14:31.489
I thought I was, too, but...

14:33.524 --> 14:35.426
Danni, I just wanna talk to you.

14:37.461 --> 14:39.263
'Kay.
Talk.

14:39.263 --> 14:42.533
[music]

14:42.533 --> 14:44.101
Why won't you marry me?

14:45.870 --> 14:47.204
Sweet...

14:47.805 --> 14:49.406
Sweet Preston.

14:50.374 --> 14:52.510
Tell me.
Honestly.

15:03.954 --> 15:05.589
I'll put it this way...

15:06.590 --> 15:08.225
We don't have enough in common.

15:09.593 --> 15:11.595
Okay.
What else?

15:13.597 --> 15:15.065
And I think that...

15:15.065 --> 15:16.467
That's important...

15:17.334 --> 15:18.302
And I...

15:18.569 --> 15:19.670
You don't love me.

15:20.471 --> 15:24.041
I really, really like you!
Yeah, I...

15:26.710 --> 15:28.979
I really, really like you,
Preston.

15:32.316 --> 15:33.450
But...

15:34.885 --> 15:36.320
You don't love me.

15:36.687 --> 15:38.289
No, no.

15:38.289 --> 15:40.391
Like I love you.

15:40.391 --> 15:41.892
Why?

15:42.960 --> 15:44.361
I do love you.

15:46.630 --> 15:47.865
I...

15:52.636 --> 15:53.637
Okay.

15:54.705 --> 15:56.307
Not the way you love me.

15:57.174 --> 15:58.342
Yeah.

15:58.776 --> 16:00.611
That's what I said, and...

16:01.478 --> 16:04.014
Quite frankly, that's what
I already thought.

16:07.751 --> 16:09.353
I know that's what you thought.

16:10.054 --> 16:11.722
So, can we just...?

16:11.989 --> 16:13.490
Danni...

16:13.490 --> 16:15.993
What do I have to do
to make you love me

16:15.993 --> 16:17.995
Like I love you?

16:19.663 --> 16:22.266
Preston, I think you should ask
a better question.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.201
What do you mean?

16:26.437 --> 16:29.206
When you just know,
you just know.

16:29.607 --> 16:30.608
It's right.

16:32.476 --> 16:35.245
And I really like you,
but I don't think...

16:35.713 --> 16:37.014
This is right.

16:39.416 --> 16:40.451
Go on.

16:42.720 --> 16:45.289
So, I don't wanna be married to
you because...

16:45.689 --> 16:47.558
Older I get, I like my space.

16:48.626 --> 16:52.496
And it's really important that
I get to be my...

16:52.496 --> 16:54.098
True self, my...

16:55.899 --> 16:56.934
Full...

16:57.334 --> 16:59.970
-Authentic self.
-[Preston] Yeah, I see.

16:59.970 --> 17:05.976
[music]

17:05.976 --> 17:07.144
So...

17:07.678 --> 17:09.880
I really don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.048
Can we...?

17:14.785 --> 17:16.253
My answer's no.

17:19.556 --> 17:21.158
I should probably go.

17:25.529 --> 17:28.499
As long as you don't threaten
to marry Mindy again.

17:30.534 --> 17:32.269
Yeah, okay.

17:33.537 --> 17:36.607
From where I sit, you don't
wanna marry her, either.

17:40.511 --> 17:41.712
She's not you.

17:41.712 --> 17:44.048
Then why would you marry her?

17:46.016 --> 17:47.818
What am I supposed to do, Danni?

17:48.385 --> 17:50.454
Stay single my entire life?

17:51.422 --> 17:54.024
You don't think that's better
than being married to

17:54.024 --> 17:55.693
the wrong person
your entire life?

17:56.326 --> 17:58.228
Danni, there's
nothing out there.

17:58.228 --> 17:59.897
And I see it every day.

17:59.897 --> 18:01.165
Okay.

18:01.465 --> 18:02.599
Okay.

18:03.967 --> 18:05.836
I'm just surprised that you
haven't seen it.

18:05.836 --> 18:07.004
Oh, baby, I've seen it.

18:07.004 --> 18:08.272
I've seen the worst of it,
but...

18:08.272 --> 18:10.407
Okay then, Danni, we should...

18:11.208 --> 18:12.409
-We should just get married.
-[Danni] I'm not...

18:12.409 --> 18:14.745
I'm not ready to be
anybody's wife, Preston.

18:15.312 --> 18:18.449
You know?
I don't wanna be...

18:18.449 --> 18:19.450
A possession.

18:21.251 --> 18:24.154
Is that what you really think
marriage is?

18:24.154 --> 18:26.056
Mm-mm.
No...

18:26.657 --> 18:29.193
But I think that's what it will
be if we...

18:30.794 --> 18:31.929
If...

18:32.529 --> 18:34.798
That's what I think
it would be for me.

18:35.132 --> 18:38.068
-So...
-Okay, all right, fine.

18:38.068 --> 18:39.203
Fine.

18:39.937 --> 18:41.672
Okay, can we just...?

18:44.541 --> 18:45.576
Thanks for dinner.

18:46.343 --> 18:47.344
Yeah.

18:47.344 --> 18:48.846
[Danni] Let's just...

18:48.846 --> 18:50.447
Eat in peace.

18:53.150 --> 18:55.085
But I'm going to head home
in the morning.

18:56.353 --> 18:59.690
Just thought you
should know that.

18:59.690 --> 19:01.892
I kinda already knew that.

19:01.892 --> 19:03.694
But yeah, okay.

19:04.962 --> 19:06.063
Really?

19:07.030 --> 19:10.100
Well then, let's just not talk
about it anymore, then.

19:10.100 --> 19:11.001
You know?
Let's, let's...

19:11.001 --> 19:12.336
Okay, wait.

19:14.271 --> 19:15.506
Danni, I mean...

19:15.806 --> 19:17.241
I'm not mad.

19:18.142 --> 19:20.144
-[Danni] Mm-mm.
-I'm...

19:21.378 --> 19:23.447
Not hurt, I just...

19:24.181 --> 19:26.350
Think it's best if I go.

19:26.650 --> 19:27.718
'Kay.

19:28.452 --> 19:30.721
-I'll talk to you tomorrow.
-Mm-hm.

19:30.954 --> 19:33.157
I guess that's fine.

19:38.128 --> 19:44.268
[music]

19:57.190 --> 19:58.624
Where's Karen?

19:59.125 --> 20:00.326
Gone.

20:00.893 --> 20:02.762
Gone where?

20:02.762 --> 20:07.166
I know you ain't in here makin'
fun of my accent.

20:07.166 --> 20:10.002
Pam, I don't got time for
your bullshit today.

20:10.002 --> 20:11.204
Okay?

20:11.871 --> 20:13.105
Well, why?

20:13.105 --> 20:14.640
Where is she?

20:14.640 --> 20:16.175
She left!

20:17.677 --> 20:18.678
Where did she go?

20:19.078 --> 20:21.280
I don't know!

20:22.381 --> 20:24.083
Which one of y'all took
a picture of me?

20:24.083 --> 20:25.351
What?

20:25.351 --> 20:26.986
One of y'all in here took
a picture of me,

20:26.986 --> 20:28.120
and sent it to Fatima!

20:28.120 --> 20:30.289
Ooh, that's messy!

20:30.289 --> 20:31.857
Pam, stop playin' with me, yo!

20:31.857 --> 20:33.492
-Okay!
-I'm not playin'!

20:33.492 --> 20:36.295
I don't even know what pic
you talkin' about!

20:36.295 --> 20:39.265
Everybody in this shop
is on bullshit right now.

20:39.265 --> 20:40.900
Ooh, excuse me?

20:42.134 --> 20:43.469
Pam, where did she go?

20:45.738 --> 20:46.872
You know where she went.

20:46.872 --> 20:48.241
I do not.

20:48.241 --> 20:50.843
Okay.
Call her.

20:50.843 --> 20:52.044
I will not.

20:52.044 --> 20:53.346
Call her, Pam!

20:53.346 --> 20:55.481
Oh, no!
You need to calm all the way...

20:55.481 --> 20:57.116
I'm not calmin' down!
I'm not!

20:57.116 --> 20:58.784
She's not answerin' her phone!

20:59.986 --> 21:01.787
'Cause she's with her man.

21:02.288 --> 21:03.756
So, you do know where she went.

21:03.756 --> 21:05.391
I ain't callin' her.

21:07.293 --> 21:08.894
Uh-uh, don't do that!

21:08.894 --> 21:10.529
[Zac] Move, Pam!
Move!

21:23.075 --> 21:24.677
What's not workin'?

21:24.677 --> 21:25.778
It's Zac.

21:25.778 --> 21:26.746
Where you?

21:27.513 --> 21:29.215
Why you callin' from the salon?

21:29.215 --> 21:30.850
I gotta talk to you.

21:31.484 --> 21:34.320
Well, I'm at Steam Plant, so...
What's up?

21:34.320 --> 21:35.921
Don't leave.

21:38.357 --> 21:41.060
-[Karen]<i> Zac, what is...?
</i>-Karen!

21:41.060 --> 21:42.662
Pam, what is goin' on?

21:42.662 --> 21:45.064
Girl, he in here talkin' 'bout
somebody done took a picture.

21:45.064 --> 21:46.699
Picture, what?

21:46.699 --> 21:47.900
Of y'all in here!

21:48.200 --> 21:49.835
Okay, what the hell

21:49.835 --> 21:51.370
Run, bitch, run!

21:51.370 --> 21:54.473
Pam, I'm not runnin'.
Okay?

21:54.473 --> 21:56.275
Uh-uh, wait a minute!

21:56.275 --> 21:58.010
Don't let him come in there
like that!

21:58.010 --> 21:59.412
Okay, goodnight, Pam.

21:59.412 --> 22:01.013
Is Aaron with you?

22:01.013 --> 22:02.748
I said goodnight.

22:05.184 --> 22:06.652
Ooh!

22:06.652 --> 22:09.555
Well, I hope that -- can do
more than just pray.

22:10.022 --> 22:11.290
Sorry about that.

22:11.290 --> 22:12.692
What was that about?

22:12.692 --> 22:13.793
I don't know.

22:14.060 --> 22:18.664
[crowd commotion]

22:18.664 --> 22:20.466
So, you think you want
the steak?

22:21.100 --> 22:23.235
Hmm...

22:23.235 --> 22:24.937
I think I'mma do the fish.

22:24.937 --> 22:26.005
Yeah.

22:26.005 --> 22:26.972
-Fish?
-[Karen] Mm-hm.

22:26.972 --> 22:28.007
Okay.

22:36.749 --> 22:41.220
[crowd commotion]

22:41.220 --> 22:42.722
Zac may show up.

22:46.425 --> 22:48.361
Okay, why may Zac show up?

22:48.361 --> 22:49.695
I don't know.

22:49.695 --> 22:52.131
Pam said somethin'
about a picture, or...?

22:52.131 --> 22:53.199
What picture?

22:53.199 --> 22:55.601
I really don't know.
So...

22:57.370 --> 22:59.338
Okay, is this something
to be concerned about?

23:00.539 --> 23:04.343
Well, it ain't my concern.
But he did sound really mad.

23:05.945 --> 23:06.946
Okay.

23:06.946 --> 23:08.581
Yeah.

23:09.715 --> 23:11.350
Okay, well, do you wanna go?

23:11.817 --> 23:12.918
No!

23:14.120 --> 23:15.955
Okay, I don't want you dealin'
with any drama tonight.

23:15.955 --> 23:18.457
I'm not dealin' with no drama,
I promise.

23:19.592 --> 23:21.026
Okay, well, let's just go, then.

23:21.026 --> 23:21.994
No!

23:22.828 --> 23:24.797
This is my first time
out the house like that.

23:24.797 --> 23:27.066
You brought us to dinner,
let's just stay.

23:27.433 --> 23:30.369
It'll be fine.
No matter what it is.

23:32.104 --> 23:33.339
You sure?

23:33.339 --> 23:34.740
Yeah, I'm not leavin'.

23:37.810 --> 23:39.645
And you don't know
what it's about?

23:40.379 --> 23:42.014
Your guess is as good as mine.

23:42.014 --> 23:43.015
So...

23:44.917 --> 23:46.051
Okay.

23:46.051 --> 23:47.386
I guess we'll find out.

23:47.386 --> 23:48.521
Yup.

23:48.521 --> 23:51.924
[crowd commotion]

23:51.924 --> 23:53.659
Yeah, I'mma do the fish.
The fish looks good.

23:53.659 --> 23:55.995
-Want your fish?
-Yup, fish.

23:58.464 --> 23:59.899

</i>-Hey.

23:59.899 --> 24:01.400
How are you?

24:02.468 --> 24:03.736
Not good.

24:04.170 --> 24:05.871
What's goin' on?

24:05.871 --> 24:07.907
Shit with Preston.

24:08.474 --> 24:09.708
Oh, Danni...

24:10.910 --> 24:13.579
And he's all up on me,
askin' me to marry him.

24:14.246 --> 24:15.214
What?

24:15.481 --> 24:16.816
Yeah.

24:17.750 --> 24:19.685
[Andi]<i> Okay, that doesn't
sound right.</i>

24:20.319 --> 24:21.353
I know.

24:21.353 --> 24:22.988
And I don't want him...

24:25.324 --> 24:26.659
Like this.

24:27.326 --> 24:29.228
Oh, Danni, you...

24:29.228 --> 24:32.431
[Danni]<i> Just please stop me
from doin' somethin' stupid.</i>

24:32.431 --> 24:35.034
Like what?
You're not gonna marry him.

24:35.634 --> 24:38.704
Shit, I just wanna get laid
and stop thinkin' about it.

24:38.704 --> 24:40.139
So...

24:40.139 --> 24:42.541
Do I need to remind you about
what happened to the last stray?

24:42.842 --> 24:46.111
[music]

24:46.111 --> 24:48.147
Okay, Andi.

24:48.147 --> 24:49.248
I know.

24:49.748 --> 24:52.718
Yes, do not invite anyone
over to your home.

24:52.718 --> 24:54.220
Do you understand me?

24:54.220 --> 24:56.822
Okay, I won't.
Thanks, Andi.

24:56.822 --> 24:59.225
You know anyone at your job?
How 'bout that, you know?

24:59.225 --> 25:00.226
You bet them...

25:00.226 --> 25:01.694
Immediately no.

25:02.328 --> 25:03.696
All right, yeah.
Whatever.

25:03.696 --> 25:05.831
I'm just gonna head over to
Sabrina's house, okay?

25:05.831 --> 25:08.200
That's fine, but don't invite
anyone home.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.803
-Okay?
-I know, I know.

25:10.803 --> 25:13.305
All right? Shit, I just wanna
stop thinkin' about it now.

25:13.305 --> 25:14.874
So...

25:14.874 --> 25:16.342
Danni...

25:16.342 --> 25:18.744
Not thinking about it doesn't
mean it's gonna be fixed, okay?

25:18.744 --> 25:21.146
Okay.
Thank you.

25:21.413 --> 25:23.048
Okay, I gotta go.

Excuse me one moment.

25:36.312 --> 25:37.380
-Yeah.
-Okay.

25:37.380 --> 25:38.347

-Hey!

25:50.059 --> 25:51.027
Hey!

So, this is where you were

25:56.199 --> 25:57.433
Aw...

-[Aaron] Great to see you, too.

26:00.002 --> 26:02.405
I'm just gonna go to the bar

26:03.673 --> 26:04.907
Okay.

26:04.907 --> 26:06.776
Oh, you know what?
While you here...

Papers.

26:08.978 --> 26:09.912
Okay.

26:09.912 --> 26:11.981
Yeah, I signed 'em, too, so...

26:13.316 --> 26:15.885
Karen, you signed them without
me looking at them first?

26:15.885 --> 26:17.687
Well, you can look at 'em now.

26:17.687 --> 26:19.088
I ain't give 'em back.

26:19.956 --> 26:22.525
I'll look at them after
I have this drink.

26:22.525 --> 26:23.993
Okay.

26:23.993 --> 26:24.994
Bye, girl.

26:24.994 --> 26:26.162

26:37.373 --> 26:38.774
Zac.

26:39.242 --> 26:41.444
Okay?
What about him?

26:41.444 --> 26:44.380
He called and said
he's comin' over.

26:44.380 --> 26:45.815
He sounds really angry.

26:46.916 --> 26:47.884
Why?

26:49.051 --> 26:50.520
I thought you'd know.

26:50.987 --> 26:51.954
No...

26:52.588 --> 26:53.856
Andi...

26:53.856 --> 26:55.558

I don't know.

26:56.158 --> 26:57.226
You lyin' to me?

26:57.593 --> 27:00.263
Of course not.
No, I'm not lying.

27:00.263 --> 27:01.664
So, you just not gon' tell me.

27:02.298 --> 27:05.801
If there was something to tell,
I would've said something.

27:05.801 --> 27:06.736
Hm...

27:07.603 --> 27:09.238
You definitely know somethin'.

27:09.238 --> 27:10.506

-You do.

27:10.506 --> 27:12.708
Okay, Karen, I'm gonna go
to the bar

27:12.708 --> 27:14.410

27:14.410 --> 27:15.511
Okay?

27:15.511 --> 27:16.946
Wait...

27:18.614 --> 27:19.882
Is that why you're here?

27:21.050 --> 27:22.084
What?

27:22.084 --> 27:23.786
'Cause you know
what this is about?

27:23.786 --> 27:24.987
That's why you showed up?

27:24.987 --> 27:26.389
Karen, what are you talking
about?

27:26.389 --> 27:27.890
You knew I was here!

27:30.026 --> 27:32.695
How could I...?
I didn't know you were here.

27:32.695 --> 27:34.697
Okay?
Robin invited me here.

27:34.697 --> 27:35.965
-That's why I'm here.
-Robin?

27:35.965 --> 27:38.267
-Yes.
-The man that you mad at?

27:38.901 --> 27:41.871
Karen, relax.
Okay?

27:41.871 --> 27:43.806
I did not know you were here.

27:43.806 --> 27:45.942
Enjoy your time with your man!

27:46.642 --> 27:48.344
You sure about that?

27:48.344 --> 27:49.612
I'm sure.

27:49.612 --> 27:50.746
Now stop this!

27:51.447 --> 27:52.648
Fine.

27:54.116 --> 27:55.117
If it's okay with you,

27:55.117 --> 27:56.686
I'm gonna have
a thank-you drink...

27:56.686 --> 27:58.287
And that'll be it.

27:58.287 --> 27:59.255
Thank-you drink?

27:59.722 --> 28:01.791
Yeah, I'm thankin' Robin for

Mm-hm.

28:05.461 --> 28:06.829
Anyway, look.

28:53.476 --> 28:54.644
You did?

28:55.511 --> 28:57.079
[Fatima]<i> Wait, was it Karen?</i>

28:57.079 --> 28:59.548
No, I told you she wouldn't
do somethin' like that.

28:59.548 --> 29:00.750
She...

29:01.884 --> 29:05.254
Wait, she did say that
Zac was coming up to

29:05.254 --> 29:06.722
the Steam Plant tonight...

29:06.722 --> 29:07.690

29:14.296 --> 29:15.431
I don't know!

29:15.431 --> 29:16.532
[Fatima]<i> Okay.</i>

29:16.532 --> 29:18.434
Everyone's asking me questions.

29:18.701 --> 29:20.102
Okay...

29:20.102 --> 29:21.504
[Fatima]<i> It's fine.

I'm sorry about that.

29:30.379 --> 29:31.714
[Robin] It's all right.

29:33.282 --> 29:34.350
So, you gonna eat?

29:35.951 --> 29:38.320
One drink, and then I go home.

29:38.888 --> 29:40.456
That was the deal, right?

29:40.456 --> 29:41.624
[Robin] Oh, right.

29:41.624 --> 29:43.759
Can I get a martini

29:43.759 --> 29:49.865
[crowd commotion]

29:50.700 --> 29:52.368
You sure everything's okay?

29:56.172 --> 29:57.206
Okay.

29:57.206 --> 29:59.542
-Sorry about that.
-Nah, it's fine.

29:59.542 --> 30:00.943
Let's toast.

30:01.210 --> 30:02.445
To what?

30:03.546 --> 30:04.880
Forgiveness.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.882
Oh, who said you were forgiven?

30:07.450 --> 30:09.251
Beginnings of forgiveness, then.

30:09.251 --> 30:10.419
I like that.

30:11.420 --> 30:13.255
Are you sure you
don't wanna eat?

30:16.225 --> 30:17.059
Wait!

30:17.059 --> 30:18.861
I wanna toast to something.

30:21.197 --> 30:23.833
Let's toast to you keeping
your business.

30:26.001 --> 30:27.703
I could not have done it
without you.

30:27.703 --> 30:29.071
You sure couldn't have.

30:30.606 --> 30:32.241
Come on, arrogance.
Okay.

30:32.241 --> 30:33.809
-No, very shy.
-[Robin] It's a...

30:33.809 --> 30:35.644
-[Robin] It's a good look.
-Very, very shy.

[giggling]

30:37.513 --> 30:38.681
[Robin] Sure.

30:38.681 --> 30:39.782
That's good.

30:42.551 --> 30:45.588
[crickets chirping]

30:45.588 --> 30:47.623
So, what happened?

30:47.990 --> 30:50.793
Girl, he left.
He's pissed.

30:51.560 --> 30:52.762
He just left?

30:52.762 --> 30:53.729
Yes.

30:53.729 --> 30:55.731
Goin' to confront Karen.

30:56.599 --> 30:57.967
You think that's a good idea?

30:58.267 --> 30:59.502
No, I don't.

31:01.337 --> 31:02.338
Shit.

31:02.838 --> 31:05.141
I shoulda never sent you
that picture.

31:05.141 --> 31:06.275
No...

31:06.275 --> 31:08.310
Angela, you, you did
the right thing.

31:08.310 --> 31:09.812
I know, but I mean...

31:09.812 --> 31:11.447
Look at all the drama
you're havin'.

31:13.149 --> 31:14.116
It's fine.

31:16.318 --> 31:19.421
Did he even confess to
kissin' her?

31:19.922 --> 31:21.791
He said it was just a hug.

31:22.424 --> 31:23.592
And that's it?

31:23.592 --> 31:24.927
That's what he said,

31:24.927 --> 31:26.395
and then he stormed
outta here, pissed.

31:28.564 --> 31:29.899
Shit.

31:29.899 --> 31:31.233
I'm sorry.

31:31.901 --> 31:33.869
I'm not dealin' with
no bullshit, Angela.

31:33.869 --> 31:35.538
I know.

31:35.538 --> 31:37.840
You know all the shit I done
put up with in the past, so...

31:37.840 --> 31:40.209
But, but this is not that.
Right?

31:40.976 --> 31:42.044
I know it's not, but...

31:42.444 --> 31:44.480
I mean, you always say
Zac is different.

31:45.848 --> 31:47.483
He is.

31:47.483 --> 31:49.485
Then why is he doin' this?

31:49.485 --> 31:51.220
Let's just see what he says.

31:52.354 --> 31:54.623
Look, I already know what
you gon' say.

31:55.224 --> 31:57.126
I know I've done the work...

31:57.860 --> 31:59.261
To get better, but...

31:59.695 --> 32:01.263
That was after
my last situation,

32:01.263 --> 32:02.832
this is somethin' totally
different.

32:02.832 --> 32:03.899
I know.

32:03.899 --> 32:05.601
You know me.

32:05.601 --> 32:06.836
Yeah.

32:06.836 --> 32:08.704
At the first sign of trouble,
you run.

32:08.704 --> 32:10.506
Yeah, 'cause I don't like drama.

32:11.373 --> 32:12.775
Well, let's just...

32:12.775 --> 32:14.476
Let's just wait and see
what he says.

32:15.010 --> 32:17.213
You know he wouldn't even tell
me the full story?

32:18.714 --> 32:20.249
Why did he just leave?

32:21.016 --> 32:22.918
He thinks she set him up.

32:24.486 --> 32:27.256
Now, did you tell him that's not
what this was?

32:27.256 --> 32:28.524
Yes, I did.

32:29.291 --> 32:30.492
You sure?

32:31.493 --> 32:32.728
Yes, but...

32:33.729 --> 32:36.966
Angela, are you sure your girl
does not know Karen?

32:37.366 --> 32:38.467
She doesn't.

32:38.701 --> 32:40.169
Okay.

32:40.569 --> 32:43.072
Unless she's lyin' on him.

32:44.773 --> 32:46.575
Hm...
Do you trust her?

32:47.209 --> 32:47.943
I mean...

32:48.744 --> 32:50.813
All I can say is I really don't
think she's the type

32:50.813 --> 32:52.214
to do somethin' like this.

32:53.649 --> 32:56.819
Well, you let me find out that
Karen is the type to do this.

32:57.286 --> 32:59.722
Now, do you really think she
would do all of this?

33:00.022 --> 33:01.891
I don't really know the girl.

33:02.992 --> 33:04.360
Look, she's cool...

33:04.360 --> 33:07.263
But some of the shit she does
is just crazy.

33:07.897 --> 33:09.098
Shit.

33:11.066 --> 33:13.035
Look, it's...
It's okay.

33:13.636 --> 33:15.137
No, it's not.

33:15.938 --> 33:18.974
No, it's not.
But it will be.

33:20.342 --> 33:21.377
Well...

33:21.744 --> 33:22.945
What you gonna do?

33:23.712 --> 33:26.215
Not a damn thing,
I'mma sit right here and wait.

33:26.715 --> 33:28.384
Okay.

33:28.384 --> 33:30.419
Well, if you want, I will wait
with you 'til he gets back.

33:30.920 --> 33:35.190
[music]

33:35.190 --> 33:37.092
Shit, I'm not doin' this.

33:37.092 --> 33:39.261
-[Angela] What?
-[Fatima] I'm goin'.

33:39.261 --> 33:40.095
Where?

33:40.095 --> 33:41.196
To Steam Plant.

33:41.196 --> 33:43.165
-Fatima...
-I'm going!

33:43.165 --> 33:44.833
Well, shit.
I'm drivin'!

33:44.833 --> 33:45.968
[Fatima] Come on.

33:54.778 --> 33:56.679
[sighing]
[footsteps]

33:57.714 --> 33:59.315
Oh, it's him.

33:59.315 --> 34:00.283
What?

34:00.950 --> 34:01.951
Maurice?

34:01.951 --> 34:03.119
Hey.

34:03.586 --> 34:05.388
Hey, it's me and Sabrina.

34:06.389 --> 34:07.590
What's goin' on?

34:07.590 --> 34:08.925
Hey, Maurice...

34:08.925 --> 34:10.627
Don't "Hey" me, bitch.

34:12.028 --> 34:13.062
What are you doing?

34:13.062 --> 34:15.965
What is going on?

34:15.965 --> 34:19.402
We're trying to get the money
to get you outta there, okay?

34:19.402 --> 34:20.537
Shit...

34:20.537 --> 34:22.005
[Sabrina]<i> We are workin'
on it, okay?</i>

34:22.005 --> 34:23.640
Y'all don't have
that kinda money.

34:23.640 --> 34:25.642
[Sabrina]<i> We know we don't have
that kinda money.</i>

34:25.642 --> 34:27.310
No.

34:27.310 --> 34:29.112
I can't stay in here
much longer.

34:29.112 --> 34:30.513
[Sabrina]<i> I know.</i>

34:30.513 --> 34:31.514
No, you don't!

34:31.514 --> 34:33.183
Sabrina, I have to get
out of here.

34:33.183 --> 34:35.885
All right, Maurice, you just
need to stay calm, all right?

34:35.885 --> 34:37.754
That is easy for you to say,
Calvin.

34:37.754 --> 34:40.824
You would enjoy yourself in
here with all this --.

34:41.391 --> 34:43.393
Look, man.
We're tryin' to help you.

34:44.260 --> 34:46.062
Y'all ain't doin' shit.

34:46.062 --> 34:47.430
Yes, we are.

34:47.430 --> 34:48.498
What'cha doin'?

34:49.732 --> 34:51.835
We're asking people for money.

34:52.235 --> 34:53.970
I, I, I asked Bayo.

34:53.970 --> 34:56.172
Okay?
And what did he say?

34:57.640 --> 34:58.741
He said no...

34:59.075 --> 35:01.477
Why the -- would you
bring it up?

35:01.477 --> 35:02.545
Shit.

35:02.846 --> 35:03.980
I'm sorry.

35:06.316 --> 35:07.317
Listen.

35:07.317 --> 35:09.352
Do you want me to just
rot in here?

35:09.352 --> 35:11.354
No, of course you're not.

35:11.354 --> 35:12.388
[sighing]

35:12.388 --> 35:13.456
[Maurice]<i> How can you say that</i>

35:13.456 --> 35:15.091
when you don't have the cash?

35:15.091 --> 35:16.860
And you don't know anybody
with the cash?

35:16.860 --> 35:18.962
We're trying, Maurice.

35:18.962 --> 35:20.563
To bullshit me?

35:20.563 --> 35:22.265
No, we're not!

35:22.832 --> 35:24.500
I've got to get out...

35:24.968 --> 35:26.402
Of here.

35:26.402 --> 35:28.838
Maurice, please, I don't want
you to worry about this.

35:28.838 --> 35:30.006
You know what?

35:30.740 --> 35:32.709
I'm just gonna figure
this out on my own.

35:34.244 --> 35:35.545
We're trying, okay?

35:35.545 --> 35:37.146
I'm trying everything to
get you out of there.

35:37.146 --> 35:39.015
We're working on it.
We're getting the money.

35:39.015 --> 35:40.283
So what, Sabrina?

35:40.683 --> 35:43.086
You want me to just stay in here
until the trial?

35:43.086 --> 35:45.188
No!
That's...

35:45.722 --> 35:48.057
Listen...
I'm gonna go.

35:48.324 --> 35:49.592
Where are you gonna go?

35:51.194 --> 35:53.296
To the pool, bitch!

35:54.364 --> 35:55.932
Why are you being like this?

35:55.932 --> 35:57.166
Where the hell else I'mma go?

35:57.166 --> 35:58.768
I'm in jail!

35:58.768 --> 36:00.036
I'm going to my cell!

36:00.036 --> 36:01.671
I'm goin' to hell!

36:02.705 --> 36:03.873
I know, Maurice.

36:03.873 --> 36:05.775
I'm not trying to be
insensitive.

36:05.775 --> 36:07.043
Goodbye.

36:07.810 --> 36:10.580
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

36:11.614 --> 36:12.715
Goodbye.

36:13.116 --> 36:14.617
He hung up.

36:15.084 --> 36:16.219
Shit.

36:17.887 --> 36:19.355
I don't know, I mean...

36:19.989 --> 36:22.125
Maybe I can make some calls,
but...

36:22.125 --> 36:23.927
Come on, now, 1.5?

36:24.327 --> 36:25.695
That's a lot of money.

36:26.996 --> 36:28.398
[knocking on door]

36:29.565 --> 36:30.500
Come in!

36:31.034 --> 36:32.268
[knocking on door]

36:33.069 --> 36:35.238
-Hey.
-Hey.

36:37.674 --> 36:39.842
I better get outta here.

36:39.842 --> 36:41.477
No, stay.

36:42.912 --> 36:44.480
[Calvin] Nah, I'mma go.

36:47.450 --> 36:50.453
Well, don't say it was 'cause
I wasn't bein' nice to you.

36:51.154 --> 36:52.655
Have a good evening, Danni.

36:52.655 --> 36:53.756
Bye, Cal.

36:57.627 --> 36:59.562
He's a pretty guy.

37:04.701 --> 37:05.802
How are you?

37:06.536 --> 37:08.438
[Sabrina] Danni, are you high?

37:10.106 --> 37:11.574
Let me join you.

37:11.574 --> 37:12.809
Okay.

37:12.809 --> 37:13.943
Who's the red wine for?

37:13.943 --> 37:15.411
Oh, I poured it for him.

37:15.745 --> 37:16.779
He drank off it?

37:17.547 --> 37:18.348
No.

37:18.948 --> 37:22.452
Yeah, there's no lipstick,
so I think I'm good.

37:23.019 --> 37:24.120
Danni...

37:24.554 --> 37:26.255
I'm sorry.
How are you?

37:27.690 --> 37:28.891
Not good.

37:29.959 --> 37:31.227
What'd he say?

37:33.863 --> 37:35.198
Who's he?

37:37.200 --> 37:39.035
[vocalizing]

37:39.035 --> 37:40.837
Danni, that's not funny.

37:40.837 --> 37:42.438
You talkin' about Bayo?

37:42.438 --> 37:43.840
Mm-mm, no.
The tooth fairy.

37:43.840 --> 37:45.742
Yes, Bayo.

37:45.742 --> 37:47.243
He said no.

37:47.710 --> 37:48.578
Damn.

37:48.578 --> 37:50.747
And between me and Calvin...

37:51.047 --> 37:52.849
Both wearin' panties.

37:53.549 --> 37:55.985
No, we don't have the money.

37:55.985 --> 37:57.687
Oh, shit, yeah.

37:58.788 --> 38:02.658
But I gotta tell you, Danni,
Maurice might break in there.

38:02.658 --> 38:03.559
Hm?

38:04.127 --> 38:05.261
I just talked to him,

38:05.261 --> 38:06.629
and he was, like,
all over the place.

38:07.063 --> 38:09.298
Listen.
He'll be fine.

38:10.633 --> 38:11.634
I don't know.

38:12.468 --> 38:16.172
Sabrina, there's nothin'
you can do about this.

38:19.075 --> 38:20.276
I know.

38:20.710 --> 38:21.878
He did this.

38:23.946 --> 38:25.248
I know that, too.

38:25.248 --> 38:27.817
So, stop beatin' yourself up
about all of it!

38:33.656 --> 38:34.891
I don't know.

38:35.591 --> 38:37.927
Sabrina, you cannot help him.

38:37.927 --> 38:39.228
I have to do something.

38:39.228 --> 38:41.164
You are doing the best you can.

38:41.531 --> 38:43.866
I know, but this is so
frustrating.

38:43.866 --> 38:45.435
[Danni] I know.

38:45.435 --> 38:48.071
And to think that somebody
could be this evil.

38:48.071 --> 38:49.038
I know.

38:50.006 --> 38:52.942
I don't know what
I should be doing right now.

38:53.910 --> 38:55.411
The nerve of this guy.

38:55.411 --> 38:57.346
Yeah, I know.

39:02.185 --> 39:03.653
Danni, how high are you?

39:05.421 --> 39:09.058
Stratosphere...
I don't have to drive.

39:09.292 --> 39:10.993
Let me join in.

39:11.394 --> 39:13.796
Oh yeah, baby girl.
I got you, smoke up.

39:13.796 --> 39:15.364
Mm-hm.

39:17.033 --> 39:18.801
It'll be okay.

39:22.004 --> 39:23.172
Shit.

39:23.172 --> 39:24.707
It's okay.

39:27.110 --> 39:28.644
Did I do it right?

39:28.644 --> 39:29.946
Yeah.

39:31.114 --> 39:33.516
I have to find a way to get him
out of there, Danni.

39:33.516 --> 39:35.952
There's nothing you can do
about it tonight.

39:39.989 --> 39:42.191
Okay.
I know that.

39:42.191 --> 39:47.964
So just drink, smoke,
and be M-A-R-R-Y.

39:47.964 --> 39:50.099
Take that back out for ya.

39:50.099 --> 39:52.935
You meant "M-E-R-R-Y"?

39:52.935 --> 39:54.704
Merry?
Like Christmas?

39:54.704 --> 39:57.340
You can be anybody
you wanna be, too.

39:58.908 --> 40:02.011
[sipping]

40:02.011 --> 40:08.050
[crosstalk]

40:08.384 --> 40:10.753
Excuse me.
I just got one question.

40:11.387 --> 40:12.622
I just got one...

40:12.622 --> 40:14.390
I don't like you
playin' games, Karen.

40:14.390 --> 40:15.691
-[Karen] What?
-I don't.

40:15.691 --> 40:16.592
I don't.

40:16.592 --> 40:17.960
[Aaron] Zac, hold on.

40:17.960 --> 40:20.229
Don't say nothin' to me.
I'm not talkin' to you.

40:20.229 --> 40:21.164
I'm not.

40:21.964 --> 40:25.101
Did you have somebody take
a picture of me yesterday?

40:25.101 --> 40:26.936
What are you talking about?

40:26.936 --> 40:31.040
Did you have somebody take
a picture of me

40:31.040 --> 40:32.408
hugging you yesterday?

40:32.408 --> 40:33.910
Is that why you was so nice?

40:33.910 --> 40:35.878
Excuse me, Zac?
What are you talking about?

40:35.878 --> 40:37.046
I...

40:37.046 --> 40:38.681
-Damn it, stop playin' with me!
-Zac, relax.

40:38.681 --> 40:40.917
I'm not -- talking to you!

40:40.917 --> 40:42.084
Don't!
Don't!

40:42.485 --> 40:44.487
Dude, on everything, this is...

40:44.487 --> 40:47.356
Don't what?
You gonna do somethin'?

40:47.924 --> 40:50.026
Yeah, I'm not talkin' to this
corny-ass -- right now.

40:50.026 --> 40:52.628
I just asked you a question.
I asked you...

40:52.628 --> 40:53.996
I asked you a question.

40:53.996 --> 40:56.065
-You can't be serious...
-I asked you a question!

40:56.065 --> 40:57.266
Stop!
Just stop!

40:57.266 --> 40:59.402
I'm not stopping!
You -- with my life!

40:59.402 --> 41:01.037
Zac, come on!
Tone it down, man!

41:01.037 --> 41:02.371
I'm not talkin' to you!

41:02.371 --> 41:03.940
I'm about two seconds off
you're ass.

41:03.940 --> 41:05.308
I'm, I'm tellin' you.

41:05.308 --> 41:06.576
I'm, I'm tryin' to be nice
right now.

41:06.576 --> 41:08.077
-Enough, stop...
-[Zac] Ain't no one...

41:08.077 --> 41:09.378
Answer the question!

41:09.378 --> 41:10.746
I ain't answerin' no questions
right now!

41:10.746 --> 41:12.315
-No!
-You know what, Karen?

41:12.315 --> 41:13.649
I'm about tired of this.

41:13.649 --> 41:15.284
I'm tired of the bullshit.

41:15.284 --> 41:16.652
I came over there to be nice...

41:16.652 --> 41:17.920
Yeah, let's go.
Let's go.

41:17.920 --> 41:19.322
-Stop, stop!
-She's not goin' nowhere!

41:19.322 --> 41:20.423
She's not goin' nowhere!

41:20.423 --> 41:21.824
Yes, as a matter of fact,
let's go.

41:21.824 --> 41:23.159
-Please.
-You not goin' nowhere!

41:23.159 --> 41:24.160
[Aaron] Don't you grab her!

41:26.412 --> 41:31.751
[crowd screaming]

41:31.751 --> 41:33.052
Stop!

41:33.052 --> 41:34.320
[shouting]

41:34.320 --> 41:36.189
I wouldn't underestimate Gary.

41:36.556 --> 41:38.358
He's very cunning.

41:38.358 --> 41:40.326
[music]

41:40.326 --> 41:42.829
I know he is.
But I got him.

41:43.429 --> 41:45.198
If you don't want me to think
you're crazy!

41:45.198 --> 41:47.367
-Stop it!
-[Zac] Stop actin' crazy!

41:47.734 --> 41:48.768
Fatima!

41:48.768 --> 41:52.405
You cannot let Karen get
between you two.

41:52.405 --> 41:54.607
I know.

42:25.358 --> 42:26.559
[music]

42:27.360 --> 42:29.329
