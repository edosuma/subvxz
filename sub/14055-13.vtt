00:41.848 --> 00:44.008
Oh, dude, please
turn that off.

00:44.088 --> 00:45.088
Seth.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.408
Shh. I'm sleeping.

00:46.488 --> 00:48.968
Please tell me you weren't up
watching movies all night.

00:49.048 --> 00:50.648
I wasn't, man.

00:50.728 --> 00:53.328
Just Darkman and Hellboy,
and the first two Matrixes.

00:53.408 --> 00:55.808
Er, M-Matrices.

00:55.848 --> 00:57.448
What's the plural
of matrix?

01:01.608 --> 01:03.528
Here.

01:03.608 --> 01:06.488
It's coffee.

01:06.528 --> 01:10.568
Mmm...

01:10.608 --> 01:12.408
Ooh.

01:12.488 --> 01:14.688
You need to get in the shower.
We got school.

01:14.768 --> 01:16.328
Took a shower yesterday.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.928
No, you didn't.
I took a shower

01:18.008 --> 01:20.208
the day before yesterday.
I'm making you a bagel.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.808
No.
You need to eat.

01:21.888 --> 01:24.128
My body will tell me
when it needs food.

01:24.168 --> 01:26.128
Just like it's telling you
when it needs a shower?

01:26.208 --> 01:28.408
Do you not see
what's going on here?

01:28.448 --> 01:30.808
Yes, you're wallowing. You've
been wallowing since San Diego,

01:30.848 --> 01:32.928
and enough's enough.
No, I'm not wallowing, Ryan.

01:33.008 --> 01:34.808
I'm agonizing.
The two are vastly different.

01:34.848 --> 01:35.728
Really?
Yeah.

01:35.768 --> 01:36.728
See, wallowing,

01:36.808 --> 01:38.248
that's like lounging around,

01:38.328 --> 01:40.168
eating ice cream, watching,
uh, VH1.

01:40.248 --> 01:43.328
But agonizing,
it's more like MTV2, okay?

01:43.408 --> 01:44.648
It's no frills.

01:44.688 --> 01:47.688
Requires discipline,
days of no sleep, no food.

01:47.728 --> 01:48.528
No showering?

01:48.608 --> 01:49.648
Just sitting there,

01:49.728 --> 01:51.408
thinking and wondering
hour after hour

01:51.488 --> 01:53.328
if Zack and Summer...
Don't.

01:53.408 --> 01:55.648
...had sex in the hotel room
right next to mine.

01:55.688 --> 01:57.088
And you did. Amazing.

01:57.168 --> 01:59.168
Ryan, they spent the night
in the room right beside mine.

01:59.248 --> 02:00.608
How can I not wonder
if they had sex?

02:00.688 --> 02:02.208
Because it's pointless,
and you can obsess about it

02:02.288 --> 02:03.968
for the rest of your life,
and you'll never really know.

02:04.048 --> 02:06.128
Yeah. No, you're right.
Of course, you're right.

02:06.168 --> 02:07.368
I have to let it go,

02:07.448 --> 02:08.848
'cause there's no way
I will ever know...

02:08.888 --> 02:10.328
unless I ask Summer.

02:10.407 --> 02:12.168
What?
Yeah, came to me
last night during Hellboy.

02:12.208 --> 02:14.208
See, it's the uncertainty that's
killing me, Ryan?

02:14.288 --> 02:15.688
It won't be the uncertainty killing you

02:15.728 --> 02:17.008
if you ask Summer.
No...

02:17.088 --> 02:19.088
No, Seth, you can't ask her.
It's weird, it's creepy,

02:19.128 --> 02:20.408
and it's none of your business.

02:20.488 --> 02:22.768
You're right.

02:22.848 --> 02:24.248
I don't know what
I was thinking.

02:24.328 --> 02:26.168
Just like asleep or something.

02:26.248 --> 02:27.568
I'll ask Zack.

03:05.871 --> 03:08.591
Have you seen Seth?
Oh, I've smelled him.

03:08.671 --> 03:10.231
Smells like
teen spirit to me.

03:10.311 --> 03:12.031
Well, I tried talking to him,

03:12.111 --> 03:14.671
but he just shared
this long-winded review

03:14.751 --> 03:17.111
about some movie called Hellboy?

03:17.151 --> 03:19.071
Well, that sounds like
lady drama.

03:19.151 --> 03:21.311
Well, there seems to be a lot of
that going around.

03:23.191 --> 03:24.271
So, still
not ready

03:24.311 --> 03:25.271
to forgive
and forget.

03:25.351 --> 03:26.391
Understood.

03:27.951 --> 03:30.191
Well...

03:30.231 --> 03:32.271
I'd better go and pay
my respects to Max.

03:32.311 --> 03:35.071
You want some company?

03:35.111 --> 03:36.551
Some more company?

03:36.631 --> 03:37.991
I...

03:38.031 --> 03:40.551
I don't think that'd
be such a good idea.

03:40.591 --> 03:43.071
Well, Max Bloom was important
to you, so he's important to me.

03:43.111 --> 03:44.631
I would be happy
to go to his service.

03:44.671 --> 03:45.991
Oh, there's not
gonna be a service.

03:46.071 --> 03:47.311
What?
Well,

03:47.391 --> 03:48.391
Rebecca could never go.

03:48.471 --> 03:51.031
The Feds'd be there
waiting for her.

03:52.631 --> 03:54.311
It's just gonna be
the two of us.

03:55.911 --> 03:57.191
The two of you?

03:57.271 --> 03:59.631
Look, I...

03:59.711 --> 04:03.391
I-I...I know it sounds
a little weird.

04:03.471 --> 04:05.791
Beyond weird, Sandy.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.831
Please just hang in there
a little longer.

04:09.111 --> 04:10.431
Please.

04:12.111 --> 04:14.191
Give my condolences to Rebecca.

04:14.271 --> 04:16.511
I'm gonna see why
my dad keeps calling.

04:16.591 --> 04:18.391
Maybe I can help him
with his lady drama.

04:25.111 --> 04:26.631
Don't tell me to calm down.

04:26.711 --> 04:28.511
You're the one
rushing into this.

04:28.591 --> 04:30.111
For God's sake, Cal,
you almost died.

04:30.191 --> 04:31.351
Should be seeing a therapist,

04:31.431 --> 04:33.071
not making rash,
life-altering decisions.

04:33.151 --> 04:35.151
Thank you, Julie.
That is quite enough.
Kirsten.

04:35.231 --> 04:36.431
No, it's not.

04:36.471 --> 04:37.791
Lindsay.
Hey.

04:37.871 --> 04:40.711
Uh, Caleb called me last night
and asked me to come over.

04:40.751 --> 04:42.311
Do you know what this is about?
Uh, no.

04:42.351 --> 04:44.671
It'll be enough when you finally
start listening to me.

04:44.711 --> 04:46.591
Maybe we should go
into my off...
Lindsay...

04:46.671 --> 04:48.031
Kirsten, please.

04:49.911 --> 04:51.231
Thank you both for coming.

04:51.271 --> 04:52.391
Dad, maybe we
should come back.

04:52.471 --> 04:53.471
No, that's unnecessary.

04:53.551 --> 04:54.711
Julie and I are finished.

04:54.791 --> 04:55.831
I asked you to come here

04:55.871 --> 04:57.071
because I want to tell you--

04:57.111 --> 04:59.991
uh, as long as Lindsay
agrees to it--

05:00.951 --> 05:03.311
um, I would like to

05:03.391 --> 05:04.271
formally adopt her.

05:05.871 --> 05:07.111
Oh, my God.

05:07.151 --> 05:09.711
Dad, that's... I'm speechless.

05:09.791 --> 05:12.791
Well, you may ask, "Why now?
Isn't it kind of sudden?"

05:12.871 --> 05:13.871
Yeah.

05:13.951 --> 05:15.871
Well, actually,
it's quite the opposite.

05:15.911 --> 05:17.311
After my heart attack,

05:17.351 --> 05:19.551
I realized that something
could happen to me at any time.

05:19.591 --> 05:22.311
This way, Lindsay will be a
legal heir, and I'll know that

05:22.391 --> 05:23.671
she'll always be taken care of.

05:23.711 --> 05:26.151
And I told you
you have nothing to worry about.

05:26.231 --> 05:27.671
I will take care of her.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.111
I saw that, Kirsten.

05:30.191 --> 05:33.111
This is about more than
financial security.

05:33.191 --> 05:35.231
All through my illness,
you stood by me.

05:35.311 --> 05:36.751
Now it's my turn.

05:36.791 --> 05:39.031
I would be proud to tell the
world that I'm your father.

05:39.111 --> 05:41.151
I don't know what to say.

05:41.231 --> 05:42.551
It's a big step,

05:42.631 --> 05:44.631
but should you decide you want to take it,

05:44.711 --> 05:46.471
I think a party would
certainly be in order.

05:46.511 --> 05:47.591
Don't you, JuJu?

05:48.751 --> 05:51.271
If you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.631
Welcome to the family, Lindsay.

06:07.711 --> 06:09.191
Hey, man.

06:09.231 --> 06:10.191
Hey.

06:10.271 --> 06:11.591
Hey.

06:11.631 --> 06:12.671
Seth, how are you doing?

06:12.751 --> 06:15.631
Good. Good.
Fantastic.

06:15.711 --> 06:16.871
So listen, I know

06:16.951 --> 06:19.551
we haven't had a chance to talk since San Diego,

06:19.591 --> 06:20.711
and I figured I would take

06:20.751 --> 06:22.431
this opportunity to clear the air.

06:22.511 --> 06:24.471
You know, don't worry about it.

06:24.511 --> 06:26.591
You, me, Summer working on
a comic book together,

06:26.671 --> 06:28.831
it's probably not the best idea
in the first place.

06:28.911 --> 06:30.271
Absolutely.
I couldn't agree more.

06:30.351 --> 06:32.511
And this way, you know,
we can still be friends, so...

06:32.591 --> 06:34.271
Exactly.
Yeah.

06:34.351 --> 06:36.871
So, you guys have a...

06:36.951 --> 06:38.511
good time the rest of the weekend?

06:38.551 --> 06:39.991
Yeah, you know,
we had a great time.

06:40.071 --> 06:41.391
Great.
Yeah.

06:41.431 --> 06:42.591
Great.
Glad to hear it.

06:42.671 --> 06:44.911
So, what, I'm guessing,
a couple of meals,

06:44.991 --> 06:47.911
uh, a trip to Sea World,
maybe a trip to the zoo,

06:47.991 --> 06:49.031
a little sex.

06:49.111 --> 06:49.871
What?
What?

06:49.951 --> 06:50.511
Is that a yes?

06:50.591 --> 06:51.831
Seth.
What?

06:51.911 --> 06:53.351
You can tell me.
You don't even have to vocalize it.

06:53.391 --> 06:54.351
Just blink once if you did.

06:54.431 --> 06:55.791
What are you doing?

06:55.871 --> 06:57.031
Nothing. I'm just
making conversation.

06:57.111 --> 06:59.551
Oh. Because I thought you were
trying to figure out

06:59.591 --> 07:01.311
if Summer and I had sex in San Diego.

07:01.391 --> 07:02.391
What?

07:02.431 --> 07:03.711
I would never do that.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.351
That's totally creepy
an-and boundary crossing,

07:05.431 --> 07:06.991
and I would never do that.

07:07.031 --> 07:07.671
Good.

07:10.911 --> 07:13.471
I gotta go to class.
Zack, Zack, Zack
just wait a second.

07:13.551 --> 07:16.031
Seth, go home and get some rest.

07:16.111 --> 07:17.551
Seriously.

07:34.591 --> 07:37.991
It meant a lot to him that you
were trying to help me,

07:38.071 --> 07:41.551
but now that he's gone,
you don't need to try.

07:41.591 --> 07:43.431
I am gonna help you
with your case.

07:43.471 --> 07:45.631
Tomorrow, I'll meet
with the guy I know at the FBI.

07:45.711 --> 07:46.951
Things are finally happening.

07:46.991 --> 07:49.151
But we've got to
let go of the past,

07:49.231 --> 07:52.231
and focus on your future.

07:52.271 --> 07:56.791
What happened the other night...

07:56.871 --> 07:58.431
it can't happen again.

07:58.511 --> 08:00.471
I know.

08:00.511 --> 08:02.951
I understand.

08:03.031 --> 08:06.551
He always wanted to be
scattered over the ocean.

08:07.511 --> 08:09.751
Well...

08:09.831 --> 08:13.111
Newport Beach is honored to have him.

08:14.791 --> 08:15.951
Good-bye, Dad.

08:25.351 --> 08:28.031
You're not going
to believe this.

08:28.071 --> 08:29.711
My dad wants to adopt me.

08:29.791 --> 08:31.151
What?

08:31.231 --> 08:33.270
He told Kirsten and me
this morning.

08:33.311 --> 08:34.551
Isn't that great?

08:34.591 --> 08:37.351
Yeah, it's great.

08:37.431 --> 08:39.231
Ooh, you don't think so.
No, I just,

08:39.311 --> 08:40.551
I thought it's a little fast.

08:40.631 --> 08:42.910
Well, I know, and he totally
admitted that we still have

08:42.991 --> 08:45.111
a lot of work to do, but...

08:45.191 --> 08:48.831
he was so sweet
about wanting to provide for me

08:48.911 --> 08:51.671
and have everyone know
he was my dad.

08:51.751 --> 08:52.471
And it was amazing.

08:52.551 --> 08:53.591
Sounds it.

08:53.671 --> 08:55.071
Was, uh, was Julie there?

08:55.111 --> 08:57.351
Yeah. You should have seen
the look she gave me,

08:57.391 --> 08:58.991
like I was some
scheming fortune hunter.

08:59.071 --> 09:00.831
Well, that's what
she understands.

09:00.871 --> 09:02.031
Why should I care?

09:02.111 --> 09:03.351
It's not like
she's adopting me.

09:03.391 --> 09:05.951
No, it's just you don't want
Julie Cooper as an enemy.

09:05.991 --> 09:08.471
And I say that, having had
Julie Cooper as an enemy.

09:08.511 --> 09:11.151
So you don't think
I should do it?

09:11.191 --> 09:12.471
No, I didn't say that.

09:12.551 --> 09:17.471
Ryan, I have been dreaming
of this my whole life,

09:17.551 --> 09:19.311
that I'd-I'd find my dad,

09:19.351 --> 09:23.151
and he'd really
want to be my dad.

09:23.191 --> 09:25.311
I mean, that's
what matters, right?

09:25.351 --> 09:27.271
Yeah.

09:28.351 --> 09:29.831
Thank you.

09:29.871 --> 09:32.231
That means a lot.

09:39.191 --> 09:40.111
Mrs. Cohen?

09:40.191 --> 09:41.671
Yes. Can I help you?

09:41.751 --> 09:43.471
We're Agents Stonerock
and Tudor from the FBI.

09:43.511 --> 09:44.551
Do you have a minute?

09:51.391 --> 09:52.671
Hey.

09:52.751 --> 09:55.431
Don't you know you're not
supposed to sneak up on people?

09:55.471 --> 09:56.551
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

09:56.591 --> 09:58.871
Because they might be angry.

09:58.951 --> 10:01.231
So, my friends are
coming down this weekend,

10:01.311 --> 10:03.231
and I was gonna have
a little party.

10:03.271 --> 10:05.871
Wow, how very
Newport of you.

10:05.951 --> 10:09.791
Well, I was thinking that maybe
you would want to invite Summer.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.311
Sure. Okay.

10:14.711 --> 10:17.951
Oh, no. You haven't told her
about us, have you?

10:18.031 --> 10:19.311
I was going to.

10:19.351 --> 10:20.471
It's... I don't...

10:20.511 --> 10:22.631
I just assumed
'cause she's your best friend,

10:22.671 --> 10:23.711
but it's no big deal.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.151
You've got to wait
till you're ready.

10:25.231 --> 10:27.791
I'm ready, okay?

10:27.831 --> 10:30.431
Like you said,
she's my best friend.

10:30.471 --> 10:32.231
I tell her everything.

10:32.271 --> 10:34.911
Just make sure your party
doesn't suck, okay?

10:44.991 --> 10:45.871
Hey.

10:45.911 --> 10:47.031
Do we have guests?

10:50.751 --> 10:53.351
Special Agent Jill Stonerock.

10:53.431 --> 10:54.871
The FBI was here.

10:54.951 --> 10:56.231
Well, it wouldn't
be the Cohen house

10:56.271 --> 10:58.191
if there wasn't a visit from
someone in law enforcement.

10:58.271 --> 11:00.111
What'd you tell them?

11:00.151 --> 11:02.751
So now you're
cross-examining me?

11:04.471 --> 11:08.511
I told them Professor Bloom
came here two weeks ago

11:08.551 --> 11:09.991
and asked you to
clear Rebecca's name.

11:10.071 --> 11:10.951
That's it?

11:11.031 --> 11:12.711
You mean did I tell them

11:12.791 --> 11:14.591
where Rebecca is staying?
告诉他们Rebecca现在住在哪里?

11:14.631 --> 11:15.711
No, I did not.

11:15.791 --> 11:17.311
I'm protected
because I'm her lawyer.

11:17.391 --> 11:20.111
But if you withhold information,
you're obstructing justice.

11:20.151 --> 11:21.311
You could be prosecuted.

11:21.391 --> 11:23.271
Are you worried about me
withholding information

11:23.351 --> 11:24.351
or telling them too much?

11:24.431 --> 11:26.751
It's not a choice
between protecting you

11:26.831 --> 11:28.151
and protecting Rebecca.

11:28.231 --> 11:29.351
Oh, I think it is.
And I think you made that choice

11:46.972 --> 11:48.932
What is it, Julie?
I have a lot of work to do.

11:49.012 --> 11:50.492
We need to talk about this.

11:50.572 --> 11:52.132
If you mean
about my adopting Lindsay,

11:52.212 --> 11:54.012
I think you've made your
position very clear.

11:54.092 --> 11:55.132
Oh, you mean
that I seem to be

11:55.212 --> 11:56.452
the only one
trying to protect you.

11:56.492 --> 11:58.012
As I recall,
after my heart attack,

11:58.092 --> 12:00.612
it was Lindsay at my bedside,
you were at a spa in Nice.

12:00.652 --> 12:01.892
You can hold that
against me

12:01.932 --> 12:03.132
for the rest
of our lives,

12:03.172 --> 12:05.332
but I am not going to let you
rush into this.

12:05.412 --> 12:06.292
Now, for starters,

12:06.372 --> 12:07.532
and this may be painful,

12:07.612 --> 12:09.412
you need to redo
the paternity test.

12:09.492 --> 12:10.972
The medical advancements
in the past...

12:11.052 --> 12:12.092
There was no paternity test.

12:12.172 --> 12:13.252
What?

12:13.332 --> 12:14.332
There was no need.

12:14.412 --> 12:15.252
You're kidding.

12:15.292 --> 12:16.292
Do I need to tell you

12:16.372 --> 12:17.692
how transparent
your motives are?

12:17.772 --> 12:19.492
After all the money you've
paid out over these years,

12:19.572 --> 12:20.852
with no proof?

12:20.892 --> 12:22.892
I just thought you were
a better businessman than that.

12:22.932 --> 12:25.212
Renee is an honest woman.

12:25.292 --> 12:27.692
The kind of honest woman who has
an affair with a married man?

12:33.172 --> 12:37.412
Look, Lindsay probably
is your daughter,

12:37.452 --> 12:39.372
but don't you think you
have a responsibility

12:39.452 --> 12:42.172
to this family you're sure
about, before diving into this?

12:43.132 --> 12:44.812
I'll think about it.

12:44.892 --> 12:47.772
That's all I wanted.

12:54.452 --> 12:58.012
Hey, so you never told me
how San Diego was.

12:58.092 --> 12:59.932
Two nights in a hotel?

13:00.012 --> 13:01.372
Hmm.

13:01.452 --> 13:04.812
Well, let's just say, little
Zach is full of surprises.

13:04.892 --> 13:06.772
Well, I see.

13:06.852 --> 13:10.332
And I feel really bad I left you
alone on Valentine's.

13:10.372 --> 13:12.012
What kind of friend am I?

13:12.092 --> 13:13.572
Oh, it's okay.

13:13.652 --> 13:15.332
Don't worry about it.

13:15.412 --> 13:17.892
Actually, I wasn't alone.

13:17.972 --> 13:19.852
What?
Have you been holding out on me?

13:19.932 --> 13:20.812
Who were you with?

13:20.852 --> 13:22.852
No, no, I was, uh...

13:22.932 --> 13:24.692
I was with my mom.

13:24.732 --> 13:25.812
That's all.

13:25.852 --> 13:27.372
Oh.

13:29.492 --> 13:33.132
So listen, um, what are you
doing tomorrow night?

13:33.172 --> 13:35.492
Um, nothing. Why?

13:35.532 --> 13:37.252
Well, uh, there's this thing.

13:37.332 --> 13:38.492
A party thing.

13:38.532 --> 13:40.412
Hmm, well, there's
always a party thing.

13:40.452 --> 13:42.332
Who's throwing it?

13:43.932 --> 13:45.212
Caleb.

13:45.252 --> 13:47.532
Party at Caleb's.

13:47.612 --> 13:48.652
That sounds awesome!

13:48.732 --> 13:50.572
Yes, maybe a little
shuffleboard,

13:50.652 --> 13:51.972
a little bingo.

13:52.052 --> 13:54.932
I just thought you'd help keep
me company, that's all.

13:54.972 --> 13:56.252
Sure, no problem.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.132
Oh, sorry, it's Zach.

14:01.172 --> 14:02.652
Hey.

14:02.732 --> 14:04.572
Yeah.

14:04.652 --> 14:05.972
Crab Shack sounds perfect.

14:06.052 --> 14:07.692
My stomach is about
to eat itself.

14:07.772 --> 14:10.812
No, I haven't
seen Cohen. Why?

14:10.852 --> 14:12.572
Well, he always smells
kind of weird,

14:12.612 --> 14:14.172
but what do you mean?

14:14.212 --> 14:15.212
What?

14:15.292 --> 14:16.652
He asked you what?

14:17.652 --> 14:19.692
Ew. Oh...

14:19.772 --> 14:21.652
my... God.
Yeah, okay.

14:21.692 --> 14:23.252
Bye.

14:23.332 --> 14:25.252
Hmm, lunch is going
to have to wait, Coop.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.412
I have to go kick
Cohen's pervy little ass.

14:30.292 --> 14:31.892
Hey, Ross,
it's good to see you.

14:31.972 --> 14:34.572
And thanks for making the trek
all the way from L.A.

14:34.612 --> 14:35.732
No problem.

14:35.812 --> 14:37.692
Any excuse to get
out of the office.

14:37.772 --> 14:38.732
How's Kirsten?

14:38.812 --> 14:40.452
She's fine.

14:40.532 --> 14:42.092
Despite the nice chat
she had last night

14:42.172 --> 14:43.372
with two of your colleagues.

14:43.452 --> 14:44.732
You think I sent them?

14:44.772 --> 14:45.892
Come on.

14:45.932 --> 14:48.092
They asked me to inquire
about Rebecca Bloom.

14:48.132 --> 14:49.172
People got curious.

14:49.212 --> 14:50.652
Well, fair enough.

14:50.732 --> 14:52.452
So what did you find out?

14:52.532 --> 14:55.212
Even if she turns herself in,
cooperates,

14:55.252 --> 14:56.932
she's still going
to do serious time.

14:57.012 --> 14:58.772
Even if we can prove
she wasn't there?

14:58.812 --> 15:00.212
A man died, Sandy.

15:00.252 --> 15:01.932
And it was her key
that let him in the lab.

15:01.972 --> 15:03.132
What did you expect?

15:03.212 --> 15:04.412
The judge is just going
to let her walk?

15:04.492 --> 15:06.052
No chance.

15:06.092 --> 15:08.492
Can we talk as friends
for a second?

15:08.572 --> 15:09.772
I thought we were.

15:09.812 --> 15:12.772
I did my homework.

15:12.852 --> 15:14.572
You were involved
with Rebecca Bloom.

15:14.652 --> 15:15.972
I was.

15:16.012 --> 15:16.972
Over 20 years ago.

15:17.052 --> 15:18.212
That's right.

15:18.292 --> 15:19.892
A woman who's been on the run
for 20 years

15:19.932 --> 15:21.372
suddenly meets this white knight

15:21.412 --> 15:23.012
from her past
who wants to help her.

15:23.092 --> 15:24.932
You have any idea
what you're getting
yourself into?

15:25.012 --> 15:26.212
Of course I do.

15:26.292 --> 15:28.452
Her father was
a dear friend of mine.

15:28.532 --> 15:30.252
I owe him.

15:30.292 --> 15:31.572
What about what you owe
your family?

15:31.612 --> 15:32.652
Your wife?

15:32.692 --> 15:35.252
You think you know
this woman, you don't.

15:35.332 --> 15:36.972
She could bring you down.

15:37.012 --> 15:40.492
Well, thanks for your help.

15:40.532 --> 15:42.572
And keep your people away
from my wife.

15:44.932 --> 15:46.852
Hi, Renee, right?

15:46.932 --> 15:48.292
Lindsay's mom?

15:49.412 --> 15:51.332
I'm Julie Cooper Nicole.
Caleb's wife.

15:51.372 --> 15:53.412
Uh, how can I help you?

15:53.492 --> 15:55.452
Well, actually,
I thought I could help you.

15:55.532 --> 15:56.812
It's this adoption business.

15:56.892 --> 15:58.332
I wanted to give you a heads up.

15:58.372 --> 16:01.892
It looks like Caleb
is going to ask for
a DNA test after all.

16:01.972 --> 16:03.412
What?

16:03.492 --> 16:05.572
Look, no one is suggesting
that Caleb isn't the father.

16:05.652 --> 16:07.732
I mean, after all you would
have said something, right?

16:07.812 --> 16:10.452
All these years you've
been taking his money.

16:10.532 --> 16:11.652
God, otherwise,

16:11.692 --> 16:13.172
that would be like fraud,
wouldn't it?

16:13.252 --> 16:14.572
What exactly are you implying?

16:14.652 --> 16:16.172
Oh, nothing,
nothing at all.

16:16.252 --> 16:18.052
Just, well,
if you do have any doubts

16:18.092 --> 16:20.892
about how the test
might affect Lindsay,

16:20.932 --> 16:23.252
maybe this adoption isn't
such a great idea.

16:23.292 --> 16:25.772
I'm sure you could come up
with a diplomatic way

16:25.852 --> 16:27.132
to talk her
out of it.

16:27.172 --> 16:28.772
Yep, thank you for your advice,
but if you don't mind...

16:28.852 --> 16:29.852
Mom, who's there?

16:30.932 --> 16:32.172
Julie.

16:32.212 --> 16:33.372
Lindsay.

16:33.452 --> 16:34.892
I just came by to remind
your mom

16:34.932 --> 16:36.372
about the party tomorrow night.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.452
I hope she can make it.

16:37.492 --> 16:38.892
I'll try.

16:38.932 --> 16:39.932
You do that.

16:40.012 --> 16:42.652
Well, anyway, I should run.

16:42.732 --> 16:44.012
You two take care.

16:45.652 --> 16:47.572
What a cute little house.

16:53.052 --> 16:56.132
We should put garlic up
in case she comes back.

16:56.212 --> 16:57.372
Definitely.

17:07.092 --> 17:09.092
Yeah?

17:10.612 --> 17:12.332
You asked my boyfriend
if we had sex?

17:12.412 --> 17:14.252
Ew! What is
wrong with you!?

17:14.332 --> 17:15.771
All right,
I'm sorry.

17:15.852 --> 17:17.291
That is so creepy!
Do you know how
creepy that is?

17:17.332 --> 17:18.571
Hey, stop hitting me
with the pillow!
Ow!

17:18.652 --> 17:20.531
Seriously, what is
wrong with you?

17:20.612 --> 17:21.612
What's wrong with me?

17:21.692 --> 17:22.612
Summer, look at me.

17:22.692 --> 17:23.972
Since I got back
from San Diego,

17:24.012 --> 17:25.291
I've eaten, like,
seven raisins

17:25.372 --> 17:27.051
and a pack of corn nuts.

17:27.132 --> 17:28.252
I haven't showered.

17:28.332 --> 17:30.452
I slept like four hours
in the last five nights.

17:30.492 --> 17:32.172
Cohen.
What?

17:32.252 --> 17:34.332
Look, Zach is
my boyfriend. You're not.

17:34.412 --> 17:36.772
That part of my life
does not belong to you.

17:36.852 --> 17:39.372
Yeah, I know that, okay?
I know.

17:39.412 --> 17:40.972
It's weird
and it's creepy,

17:41.012 --> 17:42.892
I know and I'm sorry.

17:42.932 --> 17:45.932
I'm... very sorry.

17:47.212 --> 17:48.172
Well, good.

17:48.252 --> 17:49.612
You should be.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.772
You're ripping up your drawings?

17:55.812 --> 17:58.532
Yeah. Why not?

17:58.612 --> 18:02.012
I'm only saying this
for the people

18:02.092 --> 18:04.812
that have to live with you.

18:04.892 --> 18:06.452
Take a shower, Cohen.

18:08.452 --> 18:10.452
Zach and I didn't have sex.

18:41.652 --> 18:42.652
Hi.

18:42.732 --> 18:45.292
I had a feeling
I'd see you again.

18:45.332 --> 18:46.932
You want to come in?

18:54.732 --> 18:56.132
I'm really sorry
about your father.

18:56.212 --> 18:57.412
Thank you.

18:57.452 --> 18:59.132
Sandy didn't tell me
you were coming by.

18:59.172 --> 19:01.452
Are you in love with my husband?

19:01.532 --> 19:03.052
Wow...

19:04.412 --> 19:05.532
...direct.

19:05.572 --> 19:08.572
I'm guessing Sandy
doesn't know you're here.

19:08.612 --> 19:09.972
I'm sorry, I just...

19:10.012 --> 19:13.012
Um, yes, I am.

19:13.092 --> 19:14.932
I always have been.

19:15.012 --> 19:17.772
Wow, direct.

19:17.812 --> 19:21.892
If you came by to find out if
anything's happened between us,

19:21.932 --> 19:23.092
the answer is no.

19:25.132 --> 19:28.172
I'm really sorry for everything
that you've had to go through.

19:29.852 --> 19:32.572
But while you've been running,

19:32.612 --> 19:35.372
we've been building
a family, a life,

19:35.452 --> 19:38.052
and he's putting all that
in danger

19:38.132 --> 19:40.012
for you.

19:40.092 --> 19:42.012
So you've just got
to ask yourself,

19:42.092 --> 19:44.812
how much are you willing
to let him sacrifice?

19:59.452 --> 20:00.452
Miss Wheeler.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.572
Ryan, hi.

20:01.652 --> 20:03.372
Is Kirsten or Sandy here?

20:03.452 --> 20:06.332
No, but if you want to wait.

20:06.372 --> 20:09.612
Actually, I was hoping
to talk to you.

20:11.412 --> 20:13.892
I need you to help me talk
Lindsay out of the adoption.

20:13.972 --> 20:15.132
What?

20:15.212 --> 20:17.292
She won't
listen to me.

20:17.332 --> 20:18.892
She thinks I'm jealous.

20:18.932 --> 20:20.852
Then we got into this fight.

20:20.892 --> 20:22.132
I mean, we never fight.

20:22.212 --> 20:24.012
Just, if you talk to her...

20:24.052 --> 20:25.692
Why would she listen to me?

20:25.772 --> 20:27.972
Because she
trusts you.

20:28.012 --> 20:30.772
You know what She's like.

20:32.172 --> 20:32.532
I don't know.

20:32.692 --> 20:33.412
I mean, I know what
you mean about Caleb,

20:33.492 --> 20:36.932
but he has seemed different
since his heart attack.

20:37.012 --> 20:38.772
You know, Lindsay
wants this so badly.

20:38.852 --> 20:40.892
What is it?

20:43.772 --> 20:49.372
If she goes though with it,
Caleb is going to ask for a DNA test.

20:51.172 --> 20:51.892
Does Lindsay know?

20:52.092 --> 20:52.612
Not yet.

20:53.692 --> 20:55.492
I love my daughter, Ryan,
and I...

20:57.092 --> 20:58.732
I don't regret anything
I've done, but...

21:01.612 --> 21:02.772
she can't take that test.

21:07.892 --> 21:08.132
Is...

21:10.012 --> 21:10.732
is Caleb...

21:10.932 --> 21:11.692
He...

21:16.132 --> 21:17.292
I really don't know

21:22.787 --> 21:23.787
Sandy, thanks
for coming in.

21:24.507 --> 21:25.507
I don't know, Cal.

21:25.587 --> 21:28.347
Meeting in an empty office
on a Sunday--

21:28.387 --> 21:29.907
it looks suspicious.

21:29.947 --> 21:32.427
What I have to talk
to you about is
very private.

21:32.467 --> 21:34.387
Who wants
to arrest you now?

21:34.467 --> 21:38.107
The DEA? Immigration?
The Park Service?

21:38.187 --> 21:39.627
You've been poaching
elk at Yosemite?

21:39.667 --> 21:42.027
What can you tell me
about getting a DNA test?

21:42.107 --> 21:45.987
No.

21:46.027 --> 21:48.227
The adoption party
is in eight hours.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.627
Well, the papers won't come
through for a couple weeks.

21:50.707 --> 21:51.867
Surely that's enough time.

21:51.907 --> 21:53.187
So you didn't do a test
when Renee got pregnant?

21:53.267 --> 21:54.147
No, I didn't.

21:54.227 --> 21:55.267
It was an affair.

21:55.347 --> 21:56.827
I was trying
to save my marriage.

21:56.867 --> 22:00.067
The last thing I wanted was a
medical record of my infidelity.

22:00.147 --> 22:01.587
For 17 years,
you've been fine
paying the bills.

22:01.627 --> 22:03.427
Now on the day you're going
to announce it to the world,

22:03.507 --> 22:04.747
all of a sudden you want proof.

22:04.787 --> 22:06.347
How do you think Lindsay's
going to take this?

22:06.387 --> 22:08.187
I would think she'd want to know
the truth as much as I do.

22:08.267 --> 22:09.547
Cut it out.

22:09.587 --> 22:11.547
She thinks she's getting
a father, not a blood test.

22:11.627 --> 22:13.907
If you brought me here
for my legal opinion,

22:13.987 --> 22:14.987
here it is.

22:15.027 --> 22:16.387
Ask for the test.

22:16.467 --> 22:18.907
Now, you're a wealthy man
with a large family,

22:18.947 --> 22:20.867
You'd be irresponsible
to do otherwise.

22:23.347 --> 22:24.707
But as a father,

22:24.787 --> 22:27.587
I say ask yourself
if you love the girl.

22:27.667 --> 22:28.627
If you do,

22:28.667 --> 22:30.787
nothing else matters.

22:39.147 --> 22:40.587
Hello.
Hey.

22:40.667 --> 22:42.387
I know you weren't expecting me
until later, but...

22:43.227 --> 22:44.267
What's going on?

22:44.347 --> 22:45.707
Oh, party got started
a little early.

22:45.747 --> 22:47.147
I thought they
weren't coming
until tonight.

22:47.187 --> 22:48.747
But, um, hey, everyone,

22:48.827 --> 22:49.987
this is Marissa.

22:50.067 --> 22:50.947
Hey.

22:51.027 --> 22:52.587
Hi.

22:54.307 --> 22:55.867
Come in.
Let me get
you a drink.

22:55.947 --> 22:58.227
Oh, no. You know,
I actually can't stay.

22:58.267 --> 23:00.067
What are you talking about?

23:00.147 --> 23:03.347
Well, I just came by to say hi.

23:03.387 --> 23:04.307
I'll call you later.

23:04.347 --> 23:06.307
It was nice meeting you.

23:08.507 --> 23:11.867
Marissa,
what are you doing?

23:11.947 --> 23:13.107
Stay.

23:13.187 --> 23:14.947
No, no, I can't.
I'm gonna be late.

23:14.987 --> 23:16.587
But wait, You're going
to come back later, right?

23:16.667 --> 23:18.467
Because I really,
really want you
to meet my friends,

23:18.507 --> 23:19.907
and that in there
didn't really count.

23:19.947 --> 23:23.827
Well, I'll try, but Caleb's
having this party at our house.

23:23.907 --> 23:25.347
Wait. You're ditching me
for Caleb?

23:25.427 --> 23:26.387
Well, not just Caleb.

23:26.467 --> 23:28.067
I mean, my mom
will be there, too.

23:28.147 --> 23:30.827
Oh, wow.
Now it's Caleb and your mom?

23:32.307 --> 23:33.227
Listen, Marissa,

23:33.307 --> 23:34.707
I understand if
you're freaked out.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.827
That's okay,
you just have to tell me.

23:36.867 --> 23:40.187
But this hanging with your
parents? That's not you.

23:40.267 --> 23:42.547
I'll just be there
for a little while, okay?

23:42.587 --> 23:44.267
I'll just go,
score some points.

23:44.307 --> 23:45.547
That way,
they can't bitch

23:45.587 --> 23:46.947
when I come
and see you, right?

23:46.987 --> 23:48.787
Yeah.

23:50.827 --> 23:53.067
Have fun at your party.

23:53.147 --> 23:54.467
Tell Caleb and Julie I said hi.

24:02.787 --> 24:06.107
Mm. Zach, hey.
Over here.

24:08.827 --> 24:10.227
Hey, thanks for coming.

24:10.267 --> 24:11.387
No problem.

24:11.467 --> 24:13.467
Mm, I meant to wait,
but I'm starving.

24:13.547 --> 24:14.627
You look like
you're feeling better.

24:14.707 --> 24:17.027
Yeah, I am, I am.

24:17.067 --> 24:18.347
Um, listen, I just wanted

24:18.387 --> 24:20.347
to apologize
about the other day, okay?

24:20.427 --> 24:21.627
I feel like
I was out of line.

24:21.707 --> 24:22.787
No, Seth, it's okay, man.

24:22.827 --> 24:24.627
I don't blame you.
But the fact is

24:24.707 --> 24:25.827
Summer and I didn't
have sex in San Diego.

24:25.867 --> 24:27.027
Zach, shh.

24:27.107 --> 24:29.067
I don't think
we should talk about this.

24:29.147 --> 24:31.107
No, I know, it's just...

24:31.147 --> 24:33.187
You know, after you asked me,
I started thinking about it.

24:33.267 --> 24:36.067
And it's like
there we were, you know,

24:36.147 --> 24:38.747
the two of us in a hotel room
on Valentine's Day.

24:38.827 --> 24:41.587
It seemed like the perfect
moment, so why did I hold back?

24:43.867 --> 24:45.547
I mean, I know
why I held back.

24:45.587 --> 24:47.747
It's this no-sex-before-marriage
thing,

24:47.827 --> 24:50.027
which, not that I'm like
a crazy religious guy
or anything like that,

24:50.067 --> 24:51.467
it's just...

24:51.507 --> 24:53.067
I don't know,
it's always something

24:53.107 --> 24:54.107
I sort of believed in.

24:54.187 --> 24:56.547
But I thought you
and the tutor...

24:56.627 --> 24:59.267
No, no, I didn't say
we had sex, man.

24:59.347 --> 25:01.507
I was 14, she was 30.

25:01.547 --> 25:06.107
But look, Seth,
what you made me realize is,

25:06.147 --> 25:07.467
I wasn't waiting
for marriage.

25:07.547 --> 25:09.467
I was just waiting
for the perfect moment.

25:09.547 --> 25:12.187
A harmony of girl
and place.

25:12.267 --> 25:14.987
Yeah, oh, harm-harmony. Fine.

25:15.027 --> 25:16.987
I mean, I liked
the hotel room in San Diego,

25:17.067 --> 25:18.867
but a villa in Tuscany?

25:18.947 --> 25:21.667
I mean,
that's pretty perfect.

25:21.707 --> 25:23.107
That's awesome.

25:23.147 --> 25:26.067
So what you're saying is, then,
that when you two go to Italy,

25:26.147 --> 25:30.227
you'll achieve,
uh, this... harmony.

25:30.307 --> 25:31.347
Look, I just want

25:31.427 --> 25:33.347
to be straightforward
with you, Seth, okay

25:33.427 --> 25:35.627
so you can plan
your freakout accordingly.

25:39.507 --> 25:41.307
If you want to punch me
in the face right now,

25:41.347 --> 25:42.307
I'd be okay with that.

25:42.387 --> 25:44.667
Enjoy.

25:44.747 --> 25:46.947
I'm going to go home
and watch some VH-1.

25:47.027 --> 25:49.107
I think Best Week Ever is on.

25:55.627 --> 25:57.787
Hey.

25:57.867 --> 25:59.507
Hey.

25:59.587 --> 26:01.187
Mmm...
Mmm...

26:01.267 --> 26:02.307
Thanks for meeting me.

26:02.387 --> 26:05.027
Yeah, I was happy
to get out of the house.

26:05.067 --> 26:06.907
My mom and I got
in this huge fight,

26:06.947 --> 26:09.947
so I figured I'd get ready
for the party at my dad's.

26:10.027 --> 26:11.427
What's up?

26:11.507 --> 26:14.427
Ah, I just wanted to talk to you
for a minute before everything.

26:15.867 --> 26:18.627
Are you sure this adoption's
the best idea?

26:23.507 --> 26:24.787
What?

26:24.867 --> 26:27.667
I know, I mean, I know Caleb
seems like he's changed,

26:27.747 --> 26:29.547
and I know
I've said this before,

26:29.627 --> 26:32.747
but it just seems
like it's a little fast.

26:32.827 --> 26:35.427
This is, uh, great.

26:35.507 --> 26:36.707
First my mom,
and now you.

26:36.747 --> 26:38.227
What is everyone's problem?

26:38.307 --> 26:39.267
He's my dad.

26:39.307 --> 26:40.347
He wants to adopt me.

26:40.427 --> 26:41.467
Just give it
a little more time.

26:41.507 --> 26:42.867
Why?

26:42.907 --> 26:47.387
So, what, we can go bowling?
Attend a father-daughter picnic?

26:47.427 --> 26:49.747
I've been waiting
for 17 years.

26:49.787 --> 26:52.427
Forget it. I just...

26:52.467 --> 26:56.867
You think it's fast that, uh...
that I don't know Caleb,

26:56.907 --> 26:59.147
that Julie's evil--
I've heard it all.

26:59.227 --> 27:01.347
What else is there?

27:01.387 --> 27:03.107
What don't I know, Ryan?

27:06.907 --> 27:07.867
( sighing )

27:08.907 --> 27:09.827
I've got to go.

27:09.907 --> 27:11.667
Lindsay.

27:11.747 --> 27:15.387
You know, tonight's
probably one of the most

27:15.467 --> 27:17.667
important nights of my life,

27:17.747 --> 27:22.747
and I only want people
there who support me.

27:56.308 --> 27:58.948
So, guys,
what's the big mystery?

27:59.028 --> 28:00.788
Why are we all
gathered here?

28:00.868 --> 28:02.148
Well, If I told you,

28:02.228 --> 28:04.908
it would no longer
be a mystery, would it?

28:04.948 --> 28:06.628
Excuse me.

28:07.948 --> 28:09.548
You should get
another glass
of champagne

28:09.628 --> 28:10.908
'cause this
is one surprise

28:10.948 --> 28:13.108
you won't already find
posted on the Internet.

28:16.388 --> 28:19.668
Is it weird that
nobody knows why
they're here?

28:19.708 --> 28:22.228
That's my dad.

28:22.268 --> 28:25.748
He loves a surprise
announcement.

28:25.828 --> 28:27.108
Well, you know,
I haven't seen
your mom yet.

28:27.188 --> 28:30.428
Oh, yeah, um, she's not coming.

28:30.508 --> 28:32.308
Oh, no, is she okay
with everything?

28:32.348 --> 28:33.908
Kirsten, is Sandy
here yet?

28:33.948 --> 28:37.508
No, not yet.
He's coming with
the boys. Why?

28:37.548 --> 28:39.188
Oh, there's something
I want to discuss with him.

28:40.108 --> 28:41.148
Business.

28:41.228 --> 28:42.748
It's a really nice party.

28:42.788 --> 28:45.668
Yeah, thanks.
Enjoy yourselves.

28:45.708 --> 28:46.908
Well, looks like
everyone's

28:46.948 --> 28:47.948
a little nervous.

28:50.428 --> 28:53.308
Hey, Rebecca,
I brought you some Chinese.

29:17.228 --> 29:18.908
Seriously, what was I thinking?

29:18.948 --> 29:21.668
That Summer was in the hotel
room saying, "No, Zach, I can't.

29:21.708 --> 29:23.028
I'm still in love with Seth"?

29:23.068 --> 29:24.348
Well, weren't you?

29:24.388 --> 29:26.748
That's kind of a rhetorical
question. Thanks.

29:26.828 --> 29:28.068
Why don't you come to the party,
get your mind off it?

29:28.148 --> 29:29.468
My mind off the fact

29:29.548 --> 29:31.228
that Summer and Zach are going
to Tuscany to have sex

29:31.308 --> 29:33.148
and fall even more in love
than they already are?

29:33.228 --> 29:34.348
You're right.

29:34.388 --> 29:35.748
Why don't I stay here?
We can hang out.

29:35.828 --> 29:37.108
Dude, you can't skip the party.

29:37.148 --> 29:38.828
Why not? Lindsay doesn't
really want me there.

29:38.868 --> 29:39.948
Of course she does.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.748
Besides, you know what?
I'm fine now.

29:41.828 --> 29:42.708
I really am.

29:42.788 --> 29:43.708
I finally realized that

29:43.788 --> 29:45.388
it's over between me and Summer.

29:45.428 --> 29:46.708
I'm just venting.

29:46.788 --> 29:48.228
You think maybe you should be
venting this to Summer?

29:48.308 --> 29:49.508
Hell, no.

29:49.548 --> 29:51.588
Last time I tried to talk to her
about things,

29:51.628 --> 29:54.108
she nearly decapitated me
with my favorite pillow.

29:54.188 --> 29:55.828
I'm just saying,
if you want closure.

29:55.868 --> 29:57.628
No, I think
closure's overrated.

29:57.708 --> 30:00.468
I'm more of a fan
of open-ended, unrequited love.

30:00.508 --> 30:01.988
Okay, fine.
I'll go talk to her.

30:02.068 --> 30:05.548
But if I don't come back alive,
my blood is on your hands.

30:07.948 --> 30:10.708
My blood, your hands.

30:10.788 --> 30:12.028
I'm going to go now.

30:12.108 --> 30:13.868
It'll never wash off.

30:13.948 --> 30:15.108
Your hands.

30:16.268 --> 30:17.548
( knocking at door )

30:17.628 --> 30:18.548
Come in.

30:18.628 --> 30:20.628
Well, there you are.

30:20.708 --> 30:23.588
What's up with
inviting someone
to a party

30:23.628 --> 30:24.748
and then hiding in your room?

30:24.828 --> 30:25.788
Sorry.

30:25.828 --> 30:26.908
I just couldn't face it.

30:28.268 --> 30:29.028
Where's Zach?

30:29.108 --> 30:30.428
I don't know. Confession?

30:30.468 --> 30:31.548
What's wrong?

30:31.628 --> 30:33.868
Remember how I said
that in San Diego,

30:33.948 --> 30:35.708
Zach was full of surprises?

30:37.068 --> 30:38.228
Well, surprise.

30:38.268 --> 30:39.828
Zach doesn't believe
in sex before marriage.

30:39.908 --> 30:40.788
What?

30:40.828 --> 30:42.668
Yeah. But now, apparently,

30:42.748 --> 30:44.348
he's changed his mind.

30:44.428 --> 30:46.748
And guess who's going to
romantic Tuscany next week?

30:46.828 --> 30:48.508
Well, I mean,
that's okay, isn't it?

30:48.588 --> 30:49.508
You said you wanted to.

30:49.548 --> 30:50.548
Well, I did.

30:50.628 --> 30:53.988
It's just that
when we were about to...

30:54.028 --> 30:56.188
there was this
voice in my head.

30:56.228 --> 30:58.188
Seth?

30:58.268 --> 30:59.548
And I couldn't
get rid of him.

30:59.588 --> 31:00.348
( chuckles )

31:00.428 --> 31:01.348
Ooh! And then Zach said

31:01.428 --> 31:02.548
he couldn't have sex,

31:02.588 --> 31:04.268
and I didn't want
to explain it,

31:04.348 --> 31:06.548
so I made him believe
that I still wanted to.

31:06.628 --> 31:07.788
But now...

31:07.828 --> 31:09.668
Well, hey, look, tell him
you changed your mind.

31:09.748 --> 31:11.588
Zach will understand.

31:12.948 --> 31:15.868
I know.
I should just trust him.

31:15.948 --> 31:17.708
I mean, he at least deserves
that, right?

31:22.028 --> 31:23.268
Right?

31:26.228 --> 31:27.188
I've been dating Alex.

31:27.268 --> 31:28.548
What?

31:28.588 --> 31:30.948
I mean, Alex and I,
we've been dating.

31:33.148 --> 31:34.428
What?!

31:34.468 --> 31:35.588
Just for a couple of weeks.

31:35.668 --> 31:37.748
Alex?

31:37.788 --> 31:39.028
Seth's Alex?

31:39.068 --> 31:40.228
Mm-hmm.
Girl Alex?

31:40.308 --> 31:41.308
Yeah.

31:41.388 --> 31:43.428
Huh.

31:44.788 --> 31:46.948
Well, who knows?

31:46.988 --> 31:48.268
Uh, just you.

31:48.308 --> 31:50.708
Oh, so you and Alex.

31:50.788 --> 31:51.948
Uh-huh.

31:51.988 --> 31:54.388
So, are you...

31:54.468 --> 31:55.428
are you like a...

31:55.508 --> 31:57.828
No. No, I don't know.
I was just...

31:57.908 --> 31:59.508
I really like her.

31:59.588 --> 32:01.108
Well, she is pretty hot.

32:01.188 --> 32:02.908
Hey, look, you don't
have to say anything.

32:02.948 --> 32:04.028
I just...

32:04.108 --> 32:05.548
I really needed
to tell you.

32:09.108 --> 32:10.868
We're still friends, right?

32:10.948 --> 32:13.428
Of course we are.

32:14.548 --> 32:15.428
Come here.

32:17.028 --> 32:18.308
Oh...

32:19.708 --> 32:21.308
This isn't turning you on,
right?

32:21.388 --> 32:23.028
( laughs )

32:36.348 --> 32:37.548
Miss Wheeler?

32:37.628 --> 32:38.588
What are you doing here?

32:38.628 --> 32:39.588
I have to tell her.

32:39.668 --> 32:42.148
Uh...

32:42.228 --> 32:43.548
All right.

32:43.628 --> 32:44.908
I'll go get her.

32:44.948 --> 32:46.908
Bring her out,
it'll be less public that way.

32:53.388 --> 32:54.388
Ryan.

32:54.468 --> 32:55.908
Hey, you came.

32:55.948 --> 32:56.908
Hey.

32:56.948 --> 32:58.028
Of course I did.

32:58.068 --> 33:00.708
Um, everyone's
out by the pool.

33:00.748 --> 33:01.708
Oh, great. Uh, wait.

33:01.788 --> 33:03.388
Can you, um...

33:03.428 --> 33:05.708
Can you come out front
with me for a second?

33:05.788 --> 33:07.188
What?
It's your mom.

33:07.228 --> 33:08.548
She... she's here.

33:08.628 --> 33:13.308
Sh-She wants to talk to you.

33:13.388 --> 33:16.508
So what, are you and my mom
working as a team now?

33:16.588 --> 33:18.068
She's upset,
all right?
Uh-huh.

33:18.148 --> 33:19.388
Okay, well, um...

33:19.468 --> 33:20.988
since you're just here
delivering messages,

33:21.068 --> 33:22.788
you can let her know
that in a few minutes,

33:22.828 --> 33:24.948
my dad is announcing
he's adopting me

33:25.028 --> 33:28.668
and I'd really like it
if she was there.

33:28.748 --> 33:29.828
But if she's not,

33:29.868 --> 33:31.268
at least I have one parent
who supports me.

33:31.348 --> 33:34.308
Okay, you can't... you
can't let him adopt you.

33:34.388 --> 33:36.108
What are you talking about?

33:38.828 --> 33:40.308
He might not be your dad.

33:40.348 --> 33:42.588
What?

33:42.668 --> 33:44.388
Your mom told me yesterday.

33:44.468 --> 33:49.108
I just didn't know
how to say anything.

33:49.148 --> 33:50.388
No, that's not true.

33:50.428 --> 33:51.348
I'm sorry.
No.

33:51.428 --> 33:52.308
Stop it.
Lindsay.

33:52.348 --> 33:53.788
Stop it.

33:53.868 --> 33:55.228
Why are you doing this?

34:01.068 --> 34:02.828
Hello, folks.

34:02.908 --> 34:04.628
Hey. Will you
excuse us for a second?

34:04.708 --> 34:07.388
Excuse me.

34:07.428 --> 34:08.708
Is everything okay?

34:08.748 --> 34:09.828
You tell me.

34:09.908 --> 34:11.348
Rebecca is gone.

34:11.388 --> 34:12.348
What did you say to her?

34:12.428 --> 34:13.507
What?

34:13.588 --> 34:14.868
You went to see her,
what did you say to her?

34:14.908 --> 34:17.348
Sandy, this isn't
the time or the place.

34:18.668 --> 34:21.027
"Sandy, I talked to Kirsten.

34:21.108 --> 34:24.947
I can't allow you
to put your family at risk."

34:25.027 --> 34:26.507
You have no idea
what you've done.

34:26.547 --> 34:27.668
Don't put this on me.

34:27.748 --> 34:28.987
You could've gotten her
another lawyer.

34:29.068 --> 34:30.507
You could've sent her
to another town.

34:30.588 --> 34:31.748
But you couldn't let go.

34:31.788 --> 34:34.148
I was trying
to clear her name.

34:34.228 --> 34:35.507
Tell me what you said.

34:35.588 --> 34:38.628
I asked her if she
was in love with you

34:38.668 --> 34:40.467
and she said she was.

34:40.547 --> 34:41.748
And you knew it.

34:41.788 --> 34:42.947
You knew it the whole time.

34:43.027 --> 34:45.148
I can't help how she feels.

34:45.188 --> 34:46.507
It's not how I feel!

34:46.588 --> 34:51.788
Sandy, you're asking me
to believe you, trust you.

34:51.828 --> 34:53.428
So do you trust me?

34:53.467 --> 34:56.348
At the moment,
I'm not so sure.

34:56.428 --> 35:00.148
Then we have
much bigger problems.

35:07.148 --> 35:08.468
Yes.

35:08.548 --> 35:09.748
Hi.

35:09.828 --> 35:13.428
Sorry, I was
looking for you.

35:13.468 --> 35:15.268
Won't you sit down?

35:15.348 --> 35:20.828
I-I just thought, maybe we could
make the announcement now,

35:20.908 --> 35:24.708
you know, just...
just get it over with.

35:24.788 --> 35:26.388
I mean, that's...

35:26.428 --> 35:27.668
It's all right,
isn't it?

35:27.708 --> 35:29.828
Lindsay, sit. Please.

35:29.868 --> 35:33.748
Or, um...

35:33.828 --> 35:35.948
we can wait a little.

35:36.028 --> 35:39.508
That's... that's fine, too.

35:41.868 --> 35:44.348
I know how much that you've been
looking forward to this day.

35:44.388 --> 35:47.068
But I've been thinking.

35:47.108 --> 35:50.388
I believe that it would be
best for everyone

35:50.428 --> 35:52.348
if we postponed

35:52.388 --> 35:54.868
this adoption.

35:54.948 --> 35:56.828
What?

35:56.908 --> 35:59.068
Why?

35:59.148 --> 36:00.388
What did I do?

36:00.468 --> 36:01.388
Nothing.

36:01.468 --> 36:02.828
But you have to understand,

36:02.868 --> 36:04.108
for a man in my position,

36:04.188 --> 36:08.748
why I would require
that we do a few... tests

36:08.788 --> 36:13.588
for safety.

36:13.668 --> 36:15.268
You don't think
I'm your daughter.

36:15.308 --> 36:16.708
Have you talked
to my mom?

36:16.748 --> 36:17.828
Lindsay, I need you to...

36:17.908 --> 36:18.748
No, she's just afraid.

36:18.788 --> 36:20.068
She doesn't know you like I do.

36:20.148 --> 36:22.068
And she'll say anything
to keep this from happening.

36:22.108 --> 36:24.388
You are misreading
my intentions.

36:24.468 --> 36:27.588
This doesn't mean that
I don't want to adopt you.

36:30.028 --> 36:33.628
It's just that I... I believe
in taking every precaution,

36:33.708 --> 36:36.348
and I insist that we do,

36:36.428 --> 36:40.428
for everyone's sake.

36:43.228 --> 36:44.988
I don't need to take a test.

36:46.468 --> 36:48.548
'Cause I know that my real dad
would not treat me this way.

36:50.868 --> 36:51.468
Lindsay...

36:58.868 --> 37:00.028
Oh, honey.

37:01.708 --> 37:03.468
You stay here.

37:03.508 --> 37:04.988
I'll cover for you, okay?

37:15.148 --> 37:16.868
RYAN:
Lindsay!

37:16.908 --> 37:18.148
Lindsay!

37:19.548 --> 37:20.948
Linds...!

37:21.028 --> 37:25.228
( panting )

37:27.108 --> 37:29.388
Excuse me, may I have
your attention please?

37:29.468 --> 37:30.668
Thank you.

37:30.708 --> 37:31.748
I know you're all wondering

37:31.828 --> 37:33.588
why we've asked you here
this evening.

37:33.668 --> 37:36.308
Well, it is my pleasure
to announce

37:36.388 --> 37:38.348
that the Newport Group,
under my leadership,

37:38.428 --> 37:42.708
is about to launch it's very own
lifestyle magazine.

37:42.788 --> 37:46.468
( applause )

37:47.748 --> 37:49.588
Newport Living will profile

37:49.668 --> 37:52.348
hot Orange County trends,
events and fashion,

37:52.388 --> 37:55.908
as determined by me
and my staff of...

37:55.988 --> 37:57.708
Well, me.

37:57.788 --> 37:59.068
( chuckling )

37:59.148 --> 38:00.268
( applause )

38:00.348 --> 38:03.148
Thank you.
Thank you so much for coming.

38:06.388 --> 38:08.108
Hi.

38:10.068 --> 38:11.788
Where is everyone?

38:11.828 --> 38:14.628
Oh, um, turns out I wasn't
really in the mood for a party,

38:14.668 --> 38:16.988
so the girls went out.

38:17.068 --> 38:18.548
How was Caleb's?

38:18.628 --> 38:20.868
Pretty much awful.

38:24.028 --> 38:26.228
Listen, I got freaked out.

38:26.268 --> 38:27.428
I know.

38:27.508 --> 38:29.788
It's just, I tried to tell
Summer and I couldn't.

38:29.828 --> 38:30.988
Oh.

38:31.068 --> 38:32.268
Yeah.

38:32.348 --> 38:34.228
And then I came here,
thinking we'd talk about it.

38:34.308 --> 38:35.668
And you got even
more freaked out.

38:35.748 --> 38:39.788
I just figured if I can't even
tell my best friend, then...

38:39.828 --> 38:41.468
maybe I'm not ready for this.

38:41.548 --> 38:44.188
So you're here to
break up with me?

38:45.988 --> 38:47.388
Then I told her.

38:47.468 --> 38:50.948
Wait, you told Summer
about-ahout us?

38:50.988 --> 38:52.108
Mm-hmm.

38:54.788 --> 38:56.708
So, where'd your friends go?

38:56.748 --> 38:57.948
Seriously?

38:58.028 --> 39:01.028
You still want me
to meet them, don't you?

39:01.108 --> 39:03.148
MAN ON TV:
Relationships are like geese.

39:03.228 --> 39:04.308
They fly north in the winter.

39:04.348 --> 39:05.828
It's so true.

39:05.908 --> 39:07.268
WOMAN ON TV:
What are you talking about?
( knocking )

39:07.348 --> 39:08.588
Huh, what?

39:08.628 --> 39:09.828
I was talking metaphorically.

39:09.908 --> 39:11.748
Maybe it's unnatural to
expect a relationship...

39:11.828 --> 39:14.268
Cohen.

39:14.348 --> 39:15.908
What are you doing here?

39:15.948 --> 39:17.348
I thought I told you to shower.

39:17.388 --> 39:20.588
Yeah, I just came by so you can
get one long, final look

39:20.668 --> 39:23.268
since you will never ever
see me like this again.

39:23.348 --> 39:24.468
Gee, promise?

39:24.548 --> 39:25.988
Yeah, I do.
Listen.

39:26.068 --> 39:27.308
I was under the illusion

39:27.388 --> 39:29.028
that there may still
be something here, but...

39:29.068 --> 39:31.028
I know now that it was Zach

39:31.068 --> 39:33.148
who didn't want to have
sex in San Diego,

39:33.188 --> 39:35.068
so I suffered for nothing.

39:35.108 --> 39:37.388
Have a great time in Italy.

39:37.428 --> 39:38.668
Have all the fun you want.

39:38.708 --> 39:41.428
I'm cool with it.
I'm over you.

39:43.268 --> 39:44.948
Well, good.

39:45.028 --> 39:48.348
Good, 'cause, um, well, I think
that's where we both need to be.

39:48.428 --> 39:49.628
I do, too.

39:49.708 --> 39:51.188
Which is, you know,
why I came down here.

39:51.268 --> 39:52.268
I just wanted to...

39:52.308 --> 39:53.508
lay it all out.

39:53.588 --> 39:55.628
Well, I'm glad you did.

39:55.708 --> 39:57.708
Because now I can leave,
knowing that you're okay.

39:57.788 --> 39:59.908
Yeah, I'm fine.

39:59.948 --> 40:02.908
So, um...
( clears throat )

40:02.988 --> 40:06.188
parting amicably,
which is good, it's nice.

40:07.428 --> 40:08.788
See ya, Cohen.

40:08.828 --> 40:10.588
Yeah, all right.

40:10.668 --> 40:11.868
See ya, Summer.

40:15.068 --> 40:16.628
Hey, uh...

40:16.708 --> 40:17.948
Huh?

40:18.028 --> 40:19.828
Send me a postcard.

40:19.908 --> 40:22.188
Okay.

40:29.188 --> 40:30.668
Hey.

40:30.748 --> 40:32.748
Hi.
Hi.

40:32.828 --> 40:34.188
Is your mother home?

40:34.268 --> 40:36.228
No.

40:36.308 --> 40:37.268
What are you watching?

40:37.308 --> 40:38.108
Hellboy.
Hellboy.

40:38.188 --> 40:39.988
Oh. What's it about?

40:40.028 --> 40:42.468
See, Hellboy was adopted
by this scientist

40:42.548 --> 40:43.708
and raised to be a hero...

40:43.788 --> 40:45.068
But...

40:45.108 --> 40:47.228
turns out his destiny is
to open the gates of hell, so...

40:47.308 --> 40:48.908
So, he tries to do good,

40:48.948 --> 40:51.228
but he usually ends up
destroying everything.

40:51.308 --> 40:52.908
Wow, that's my kind of hero.

40:54.428 --> 40:58.228
So... how was your night?

40:58.308 --> 41:00.468
Uh, sucked.
Summer hates me.

41:00.548 --> 41:01.548
And yours?

41:01.628 --> 41:03.748
Lindsay hates me.

41:03.788 --> 41:06.068
Well, how about some Chinese?

41:06.108 --> 41:07.388
Take the edge off.

41:07.428 --> 41:10.268
I can't.
It...
It's...

41:10.348 --> 41:11.508
Yeah.

41:11.548 --> 41:12.948
Me neither.

41:13.305 --> 41:19.408
