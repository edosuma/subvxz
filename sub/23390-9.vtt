47:47.190 --> 47:48.882
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

47:48.892 --> 47:50.859
TERRY: Marilyn?

47:53.263 --> 47:55.427
Are you okay?

47:57.969 --> 48:01.749
We receive hundreds of letters
each month from viewers.

48:02.672 --> 48:04.945
And since my husband's death,

48:04.955 --> 48:07.275
I started to receive letters about him.

48:08.979 --> 48:10.979
Often from people I-I don't know,

48:10.989 --> 48:13.106
I've never heard of,

48:13.116 --> 48:15.997
whose lives were touched
by Lee in some way.

48:16.008 --> 48:20.582
He-he supported this family when
they got into financial trouble.

48:20.593 --> 48:23.834
He helped this young man's career.

48:24.567 --> 48:28.402
He-he paid their bills
when they couldn't.

48:30.167 --> 48:32.300
And he never...

48:32.402 --> 48:34.545
told me.

48:35.939 --> 48:38.368
About any of it.

48:41.747 --> 48:43.446
Why...

48:44.147 --> 48:46.948
didn't he ever tell me?

48:53.605 --> 48:55.493
I reply to every letter.

48:56.058 --> 49:00.219
I thank them for their
kind words about my husband,

49:00.230 --> 49:01.907
and...

49:03.247 --> 49:08.730
I tell them that he's alive
in their letters...

49:11.274 --> 49:13.308
and that I'm...

49:17.914 --> 49:21.469
so very proud of him.

49:35.873 --> 49:38.841

50:02.575 --> 50:05.767
I have to tell you something.

50:10.390 --> 50:13.609
On the morning Gianni was killed,

50:13.620 --> 50:15.586
he called me.

50:17.503 --> 50:20.117
I was in Rome preparing for that show.

50:21.639 --> 50:24.010
He was up early in Miami,

50:24.021 --> 50:26.670
wanting to know every little detail.

50:28.041 --> 50:31.109
He couldn't just let me do it alone.

50:32.882 --> 50:35.500
When I ended the call, I was annoyed.

50:36.541 --> 50:39.882
I had the show under control.
I didn't need his help.

50:41.502 --> 50:45.707
So, when he called back
30 minutes later...

50:51.882 --> 50:54.583
I didn't answer.
