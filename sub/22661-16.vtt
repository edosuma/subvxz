WEBVTT

00:03.046 --> 00:04.395
[sighs]Hey.

00:04.439 --> 00:05.353
How was lunch?

00:05.396 --> 00:06.832
Oh, well, your dad
wanted to go

00:06.876 --> 00:07.964
to the Chinese buffet.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.270
It was all-you-can-eat,

00:09.313 --> 00:10.923
and we took that
as a challenge.

00:10.967 --> 00:12.490
[chuckles]It was like the war.

00:12.534 --> 00:15.058
I went into the jungle
innocent and hopeful,

00:15.102 --> 00:17.104
and I came out
just looking for a bathroom.

00:18.757 --> 00:20.194
And we blame you.

00:20.237 --> 00:21.717
Hey, before I pulled in,

00:21.760 --> 00:22.979
I asked, "Are we
really doing this?"

00:23.023 --> 00:25.199
And I got nods from you and you.

00:25.242 --> 00:27.766
We all knew
what we were getting into.

00:27.810 --> 00:29.246
What's this?

00:29.290 --> 00:31.205
Oh, that got delivered
while you were out.

00:31.248 --> 00:32.771
Ooh, let's see what we got.

00:32.815 --> 00:34.817
[Adam and Andi scream]

00:34.860 --> 00:36.819
[kids laugh]

00:36.862 --> 00:38.690
KATE and TEDDY and EMME:
April fools!

00:38.734 --> 00:41.780
[laughs]You almost scared the
all-you-can-eat out of me.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.262
Hey, Dad started it.

00:45.306 --> 00:47.264
Look what he did to us.

00:47.308 --> 00:50.659
Yeah, this morning I hit 'em
with the old sneaker snake.

00:50.702 --> 00:52.443
Ah.But guys, listen,

00:52.487 --> 00:54.097
I want to have
a serious discussion with you

00:54.141 --> 00:55.881
about this April Fools' stuff.

00:55.925 --> 00:56.839
That's right.

00:56.882 --> 00:59.233
I am so proud of you.

00:59.276 --> 01:00.886
ANDI:
What?

01:00.930 --> 01:02.366
No, no, don't encourage that.

01:02.410 --> 01:05.021
Oh, come on, it's just
good, clean family fun.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.892
We've been pranking
each other for years.

01:06.936 --> 01:09.504
Yeah, I taught your dad
everything he knows.

01:09.547 --> 01:12.768
Remember the time I sewed the
legholes of your underwear shut?

01:12.811 --> 01:14.857
[laughing]:
Yeah.

01:14.900 --> 01:17.164
I hopped around for 20 minutes
and finally got one leg

01:17.207 --> 01:19.992
through the flap
hole in the front.[laughs]

01:20.036 --> 01:22.430
How about the time you put
the fake dog poop on my bed?

01:23.866 --> 01:26.999
We didn't have the money
for fake dog poop.

01:27.043 --> 01:28.697
What?

01:29.567 --> 01:30.960
Oh, you still got it.

01:31.003 --> 01:32.048
He still got it.
Ah.

01:35.051 --> 01:35.834
DON:
Having a little prank war

01:35.878 --> 01:37.314
with the kids, huh?

01:37.358 --> 01:38.924
Yeah, you're living the dream.

01:38.968 --> 01:42.014
Ah, see? I'm not the only one
who likes this stuff.

01:42.058 --> 01:43.581
I go through this
with you every year,

01:43.625 --> 01:45.627
and I still don't understand
why you like it.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.063
Well, I don't know. It's fun.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.978
You love fun. You're fun-loving.

01:51.023 --> 01:53.069
You know, like Marcy used to be.

01:55.376 --> 01:56.812
I was fun,

01:56.855 --> 01:59.031
but then something
made me tired.

01:59.075 --> 02:01.947
Well, there's just got
to be more of a reason

02:01.991 --> 02:03.471
than just fun.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.777
Look, not everything
has a deeper meaning.

02:05.821 --> 02:07.083
It's those books you read.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.780
You got to get out
of the self-help aisle

02:08.824 --> 02:11.957
and come join the rest of us
over by the comic books.

02:12.001 --> 02:14.569
Last time I took
you to a bookstore,

02:14.612 --> 02:16.048
you laid on the floor
like a five-year-old.

02:16.092 --> 02:17.441
[laughs]

02:17.485 --> 02:20.140
It was boring.

02:21.924 --> 02:23.795
Look, I think the problem
is you don't like pranks

02:23.839 --> 02:25.101
because of that little thing
with your sister.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.886
That was not a little thing.[groans]

02:27.930 --> 02:29.149
All right, when
I was seven,

02:29.192 --> 02:31.803
my sister told me that
my room was haunted

02:31.847 --> 02:33.675
by the ghost of a lady
with a hook hand.

02:33.718 --> 02:35.242
Oh.

02:35.285 --> 02:36.808
She lost her wedding ring

02:36.852 --> 02:38.332
'cause it kept sliding
off the hook.

02:39.724 --> 02:42.336
And she would sneak
into my room every night

02:42.379 --> 02:43.728
and search for it.

02:44.773 --> 02:46.775
That's ridiculous.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.779
Who would marry a lady
with a hook hand?ANDI: Okay.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.481
Anyway, then my
sister would come in

02:57.525 --> 02:59.353
while I was sleeping and
open all the drawers,

02:59.396 --> 03:01.920
just like a hook-handed
ghost would do.

03:03.095 --> 03:05.010
And that's why I
used to wet the bed,

03:05.054 --> 03:09.014
not because of some
social issue, Mom.

03:09.058 --> 03:10.233
Yeah, but that's because

03:10.277 --> 03:11.669
your sister did it wrong.

03:11.713 --> 03:13.454
You were too young
for a scary prank.

03:13.497 --> 03:15.107
No one's gonna laugh at that.

03:15.151 --> 03:17.197
Well, you laughed the
first time I told you.

03:17.240 --> 03:20.722
But that... but that's
because you told it funny.

03:20.765 --> 03:22.158
You're a great storyteller.

03:23.681 --> 03:25.074
You know,
back when we were dating,

03:25.117 --> 03:27.424
Don used to fake propose
to me at dinner.

03:29.296 --> 03:31.863
I'd get down on one knee
at the table, and I'd say,

03:31.907 --> 03:34.692
"Darling, will you
spend the rest of...

03:34.736 --> 03:37.173
these nachos with me?""These nachos with me?"

03:38.522 --> 03:40.394
Mom, something's wrong
with my mouth.

03:40.437 --> 03:41.830
[gasps] Oh, my God.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.745
April fools.April fools.

03:43.788 --> 03:45.964
[Don, Teddy and Adam laugh]

03:47.009 --> 03:48.706
Wait, what?

03:48.750 --> 03:49.925
We got you.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.709
That's joke shop toothpaste.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.755
You were right,
her face was funny.

03:53.798 --> 03:57.715
I just thought your teeth were
so surprised to see a toothbrush

03:57.759 --> 03:59.239
that your mouth exploded.

04:00.805 --> 04:03.982
That is a classic. Me and my dad
got my mom with that one.

04:04.026 --> 04:05.288
Oh, so this was your idea.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.421
Hey, this is some beautiful,

04:07.464 --> 04:10.162
intergenerational magic here.

04:10.206 --> 04:13.775
How can you like The Lion King
and not this?

04:13.818 --> 04:16.343
Okay, don't talk about
The Lion Kingto me,

04:16.386 --> 04:19.128
because you, sir,
are no Mufasa.

04:19.171 --> 04:20.782
Okay?

04:20.825 --> 04:22.000
Now, come on, let's go
get you cleaned up.

04:22.044 --> 04:23.175
I'll help.

04:23.219 --> 04:24.655
I'm good at getting blood
out of things.

04:26.222 --> 04:28.137
Don always forgets
how tall he is.

04:31.140 --> 04:32.489
That's a shame,
but it's not your fault

04:32.533 --> 04:35.057
you got the one gal
who wet her bed over pranks.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.668
I think I can turn her around.

04:37.712 --> 04:41.106
I don't know. Once a bed wetter,
always a bed wetter.

04:41.150 --> 04:44.545
No, she hasn't done that
since she was a kid.

04:44.588 --> 04:47.635
A-And one time on an airplane
when I was tickling her.

04:47.678 --> 04:49.071
Hmm. Yeah.

04:49.114 --> 04:51.465
Look, all I'm saying
is we all love pranks, right?

04:51.508 --> 04:53.293
But Andi thinks she doesn't

04:53.336 --> 04:55.120
because her sister
screwed her up.

04:55.164 --> 04:57.035
So I just need to find one
that she thinks is funny,

04:57.079 --> 04:59.777
and she'll see that she's wrong.

04:59.821 --> 05:02.519
Yeah.

05:02.563 --> 05:04.521
If there's one thing
wives love,

05:04.565 --> 05:06.306
it's being taught a lesson.

05:08.090 --> 05:10.092
â™ª

05:19.144 --> 05:20.537
Look, we got to think
of a fun prank for Andi.

05:20.581 --> 05:23.279
Something lighthearted
to ease her in.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.716
Hmm. She loves animals.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.066
So throw a fish in the tub
with her.

05:28.110 --> 05:29.154
[knock at door]

05:29.198 --> 05:31.113
Uh, no, thanks.

05:31.156 --> 05:32.419
I think I'll stay married.

05:34.421 --> 05:37.162
Joy, Rudy, what's going on?

05:37.206 --> 05:40.078
I'm annoyed. And I was having
a perfectly good day.

05:40.122 --> 05:42.472
Which is rare.Rudy.

05:42.516 --> 05:43.778
And what shows up

05:43.821 --> 05:45.867
in my mailbox
for the third month in a row?

05:45.910 --> 05:48.173
Your redneck racecar magazine.Yeah.

05:48.217 --> 05:49.436
You know,

05:49.479 --> 05:51.046
I am so tired
of walking over here.

05:51.089 --> 05:52.917
Why don't you just change
the address?

05:52.961 --> 05:55.485
Joy, if I did that,
we wouldn't have this.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.663
Now, tell you what, honey,
why don't you run home?

05:59.707 --> 06:01.099
I'll stay here and yell at Adam.

06:01.143 --> 06:04.364
Okay, but don't be
afraid to get personal.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.931
You can start
with that shirt he's wearing.

06:08.977 --> 06:11.458
That is the ugliest shirt
I've ever seen

06:11.501 --> 06:12.937
in my entire life!

06:12.981 --> 06:16.158
She bought me the same shirt
for Christmas.

06:16.201 --> 06:18.552
So how long does she expect you
to yell at me?

06:18.595 --> 06:21.076
I can stretch it out
about 15 minutes.

06:21.119 --> 06:23.208
That is three beers if we focus.
Come with me.

06:23.252 --> 06:25.341
Come on.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.431
Check out Adam's
well-behaved kids.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.738
There's a real Children
of the Cornvibe, huh?

06:30.781 --> 06:32.304
Okay, there's no vibe.

06:32.348 --> 06:35.917
They just respect me
as a parent.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.527
Oh!

06:37.571 --> 06:39.094
[kids laughing]

06:39.137 --> 06:40.487
We got you, Dad.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.314
Oh, you sure did.

06:42.358 --> 06:45.535
I don't know if it's pride
or the beer in my eye,

06:45.579 --> 06:48.320
but I'm tearing up.

06:48.364 --> 06:50.714
Hey, you taught us well.

06:50.758 --> 06:52.803
That was pretty impressive.

06:52.847 --> 06:55.458
I wonder how they knew
which one would be your beer.

06:56.503 --> 06:59.549
[kids laughing]

06:59.593 --> 07:02.073
Okay, I see what they did.

07:06.164 --> 07:08.732
[chuckles] Oh, here she comes.

07:08.776 --> 07:11.474
Hey, kids, how about a snack?

07:11.518 --> 07:13.476
[door opens]

07:13.520 --> 07:15.435
Hey, honey.Hey.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.480
I, uh, just made the kids
some cereal.

07:19.264 --> 07:21.919
[laughing]

07:25.401 --> 07:27.664
See, I froze it.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.710
Your children are disappointed
and confused.

07:29.753 --> 07:32.016
That's fun.

07:33.104 --> 07:34.932
I'm sorry, Adam.

07:34.976 --> 07:37.587
I-I want to love it,
but I just don't.

07:38.109 --> 07:40.155
Kind of like quinoa.

07:40.198 --> 07:41.765
All right.

07:41.809 --> 07:44.333
All right. Uh, here.

07:44.376 --> 07:46.161
How about a cup of tea
as a peace offering.

07:46.204 --> 07:48.859
Huh? Yeah.Aw, that's sweet. Thank you.

07:50.861 --> 07:53.560
[Adam and kids laugh]

07:53.603 --> 07:55.997
Mommy got owned.

07:57.694 --> 07:58.956
See, you thought
you were getting tea,

07:59.000 --> 08:00.523
but it's frozen, too.Yes.

08:00.567 --> 08:01.916
Yes.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.483
Yes, I get it.

08:03.526 --> 08:04.745
You've been home all day

08:04.788 --> 08:06.007
freezing things
your family loves.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.312
[laughs]

08:07.356 --> 08:09.837
Uh, guys, I want to talk
to Daddy for a minute.

08:14.450 --> 08:16.017
I don't hate this.

08:18.062 --> 08:20.804
Okay, maybe you're
not appreciating

08:20.848 --> 08:22.589
the thoughtfulness here.

08:22.632 --> 08:25.766
See, I know that every time you
come home from grocery shopping,

08:25.809 --> 08:27.507
you make yourself tea.

08:27.550 --> 08:28.899
And I also know

08:28.943 --> 08:30.771
that you take the tea bag
out before you drink it.

08:30.814 --> 08:32.860
So if you think about it,

08:32.903 --> 08:34.992
it's like a love letter.

08:37.038 --> 08:39.867
Okay, Adam,
I need you to understand

08:39.910 --> 08:41.738
how I feel about this. Okay?

08:41.782 --> 08:43.610
I hate pranks like...

08:43.653 --> 08:46.395
you hate
country western line dancing.

08:46.438 --> 08:49.877
Ooh, I hate that so much.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.314
I know, which is why
we don't do it

08:52.357 --> 08:53.881
even though
I am never more alive

08:53.924 --> 08:55.273
than when I'm dancing in a line

08:55.317 --> 08:57.232
to a song about whiskey
and mud flaps.

08:58.363 --> 09:00.670
I love it, but I respect
that you don't.

09:00.714 --> 09:02.063
Then let's not talk about it.

09:02.106 --> 09:04.195
I don't even like talking
about it.

09:04.239 --> 09:05.849
But if we're gonna do things

09:05.893 --> 09:07.416
that the other person
doesn't like,

09:07.459 --> 09:09.374
then I don't have to respect
that anymore.

09:09.418 --> 09:10.724
I can go right upstairs

09:10.767 --> 09:12.769
and snap you
into your cowboy shirt.

09:14.771 --> 09:16.425
You wouldn't.

09:16.468 --> 09:19.210
Oh, I would. Yeah.

09:19.254 --> 09:21.430
So please play another prank,

09:21.473 --> 09:24.999
because I really want to go
line dancing.

09:26.043 --> 09:28.568
Geez, you play rough.

09:30.482 --> 09:31.527
ADAM:
Okay, come on, guys.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.876
Grandpa will be here any minute

09:32.920 --> 09:34.095
to take you to school.

09:34.138 --> 09:35.836
Hey, Dad, you really got us good

09:35.879 --> 09:37.533
with that cereal thing.[laughs]

09:37.577 --> 09:39.579
Oh, yeah, we wanted to show you
there were no hard feelings,

09:39.622 --> 09:41.189
so we got you

09:41.232 --> 09:43.800
this million-dollar
lottery scratcher.

09:45.628 --> 09:47.412
Good luck, Daddy.

09:47.456 --> 09:50.328
Guys, come on. Huh?

09:50.372 --> 09:52.548
You don't give someone
who doesn't even do scratchers

09:52.592 --> 09:55.638
a scratcher
in the middle of a prank war.

09:55.682 --> 09:58.641
I know this is one
of those fake winners.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.425
Huh? [clicks tongue]

10:00.469 --> 10:02.950
Dang it. You're too good.

10:02.993 --> 10:05.605
Well, I didn't want to say it,
but I'm glad you did.

10:05.648 --> 10:06.606
[door opens]

10:06.649 --> 10:08.042
All right, let's go.

10:08.085 --> 10:10.218
All right, thanks
for taking the kids to school.

10:10.261 --> 10:11.741
Oh, you're my boy.

10:11.785 --> 10:14.526
There's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

10:16.703 --> 10:19.488
[chuckles] Nice try, Dad.

10:19.531 --> 10:21.795
"Danger: gas leak." Boy.

10:21.838 --> 10:24.145
If that isn't the pot
calling the kettle black.

10:24.188 --> 10:26.060
Well, I had
to give it a shot.

10:26.103 --> 10:29.411
I mean, we're the Burns family.
We've been accusing each other

10:29.454 --> 10:31.674
of gas leaks
since the Pilgrims came over.

10:31.718 --> 10:32.849
You've got

10:32.893 --> 10:34.938
to get up pretty
early to out-prank me.

10:34.982 --> 10:36.679
All right,
have a good day, kids.

10:39.726 --> 10:42.859
[laughing]

10:42.903 --> 10:45.383
You got to get up
really early to out-prank me.

10:45.427 --> 10:48.952
Seriously,
I can't sleep past 4:00 a.m.

10:48.996 --> 10:52.434
Old age-- that's God's prank.

10:57.569 --> 10:59.746
Man, I was just
at the bank,

10:59.789 --> 11:01.878
and everyone was
smiling at me.

11:01.922 --> 11:04.402
I think people
are getting nicer.

11:04.446 --> 11:06.404
Well, no.

11:06.448 --> 11:08.537
Try cutting out dairy.
That worked for me.

11:08.580 --> 11:11.322
Oh. Dad distracted me
with the first sign

11:11.366 --> 11:13.281
so I'd fall for this one.

11:13.324 --> 11:15.631
Yesterday he put a bouillon cube
in my shower head.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.589
I tried to cover up
the soup smell with cologne,

11:17.633 --> 11:19.766
but I just smelled
like a chicken going on a date.

11:19.809 --> 11:21.985
So the old man
got both of us.

11:22.029 --> 11:23.900
You know, he can put
all this together,

11:23.944 --> 11:26.947
but he can't remember
where he parked at the mall.

11:26.990 --> 11:29.427
I know Andi said no more pranks,
but we got to get him back.

11:29.471 --> 11:32.779
I can help. I'm quite the
mischievous prank artist myself.

11:32.822 --> 11:35.129
I once switched my wife's lotion

11:35.172 --> 11:37.087
from lavender to violet.

11:37.131 --> 11:38.741
Get out.
Yeah.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.569
Had she noticed the difference,

11:40.612 --> 11:43.572
it would have been pretty wild.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.748
Sure. Yeah. You know,

11:45.792 --> 11:47.750
Dad loves scratchers,

11:47.794 --> 11:50.187
and my kids tried to give me
a fake winner this morning.

11:50.231 --> 11:53.451
Oh, that's good.
He's got a bunch lying around.

11:53.495 --> 11:56.759
We can slip the fake one into
the pile and wait for the fun.Okay, great.

11:56.803 --> 11:59.153
So after work, we'll grab it
and then head over to his place.

11:59.196 --> 12:01.198
This is so weird.

12:01.242 --> 12:04.680
I remember leaving that lottery
scratcher right here.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.769
Hey, honey.Hey.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.815
I have to tell you,
it is really nice

12:08.858 --> 12:10.860
to be in a
prank-free house.
Oh.

12:10.904 --> 12:12.688
So thank you for
respecting how I feel.

12:12.732 --> 12:16.300
Ah.I'd thank you in a handsier
way, but your brother's here.

12:17.911 --> 12:19.564
I could turn around.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.351
Oh, I'm not falling
for that again.

12:23.394 --> 12:25.570
Hey, uh, did you

12:25.614 --> 12:27.921
by any chance see a lottery
scratcher lying around?

12:27.964 --> 12:29.923
Oh, yeah. I gave it to Joy.

12:32.882 --> 12:34.884
What?

12:34.928 --> 12:36.712
Yeah, well, I got her a card to
apologize for your magazines,

12:36.756 --> 12:39.062
and I... you know, I put it
in as a token of good will.

12:39.106 --> 12:40.760
I just dropped
it in her mailbox.

12:40.803 --> 12:44.676
That is so thoughtful.

12:44.720 --> 12:48.158
Well, it just feels good
to do good, you know?

12:48.202 --> 12:49.594
Yeah.

12:49.638 --> 12:51.118
Good. [laughs]

12:51.161 --> 12:52.946
This is notgood.
No.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.861
The only reason that
scratcher was here

12:54.904 --> 12:56.776
was because I
started a prank war.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.299
If Andi finds
out about this,

12:58.342 --> 13:00.954
she'll be so mad, she'll
make me put on chaps.

13:00.997 --> 13:05.828
Okay. I don't need to hear how
you guys work your stuff out.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.830
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.180
Andi just put it in
Joy's mailbox, right?

13:10.224 --> 13:12.095
Yeah.So all we got to do is
get it out of the mailbox

13:12.139 --> 13:13.662
before Joy sees it,
and we're home free.

13:13.705 --> 13:15.533
Now you're thinking.Yeah.

13:15.577 --> 13:17.535
That means no yelling,
no stupid line dancing.

13:17.579 --> 13:19.624
I mean, if I'm dancing,
I do my own thing.

13:19.668 --> 13:21.452
I go where my
hips lead me.

13:21.496 --> 13:23.411
You know what I mean?

13:23.454 --> 13:25.805
One for you, one for you,
one for you, one for you.

13:32.115 --> 13:34.291
All right, let's just get the
scratcher out of the mailbox

13:34.335 --> 13:37.033
before Joy finds it.

13:37.077 --> 13:38.905
Is it in there?Yeah, yeah, I see
it at the bottom.

13:38.948 --> 13:40.602
All right, reach in.

13:40.645 --> 13:42.734
I'd do it, but my hands are
too big. You have dainty hands.

13:42.778 --> 13:45.259
I don't have dainty hands.

13:45.302 --> 13:47.522
I'm normal-sized. You're
the one who looks like

13:47.565 --> 13:50.177
he should be swatting
airplanes out of the sky.

13:54.355 --> 13:55.878
Okay, I feel
the card, okay?

13:55.922 --> 13:58.794
It's coming. It's coming.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.144
And my hand's stuck.
My hand's stuck!All right. All right.

14:01.188 --> 14:03.146
Don't panic.
We're two intelligent adults.

14:03.190 --> 14:04.887
I have an idea.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.019
What? Ow!

14:06.062 --> 14:07.759
Ow!

14:07.803 --> 14:08.935
Okay, that did not work.

14:08.978 --> 14:10.762
Cross it off the list.
Okay.

14:10.806 --> 14:13.591
Let's just unbolt the whole
thing, bring it to my house, and

14:13.635 --> 14:15.637
we'll take it apart.
Grab my Leatherman.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.769
It's in my back pocket.
I can't reach it.
Well, no.

14:17.813 --> 14:20.033
I'm not touching your butt.
This is a family neighborhood.

14:20.076 --> 14:21.382
Will you please?!

14:21.425 --> 14:23.950
I got my hand stuck
in a mailbox here.
Right.

14:25.995 --> 14:28.868
Don't flex it.
You're making the pocket tight.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.435
Just relax and let it happen.

14:34.438 --> 14:36.963
[grunts]

14:41.097 --> 14:43.491
What are you doing
with mymailbox?

14:43.534 --> 14:46.494
I figured, this way,
if Joy sees hers is missing,

14:46.537 --> 14:49.149
you can say there's
a mailbox thief on the loose.

14:49.192 --> 14:51.151
You know what?
Don't freelance.

14:51.194 --> 14:53.631
Aha! I got it. What?

14:53.675 --> 14:55.807
Wait. This isn't Andi's
thank you note.

14:55.851 --> 14:58.288
It's a renewal card
from my magazine.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.943
Oh. That means Joy
already has the scratcher.

15:00.987 --> 15:03.076
[sighs]
I told you this
wouldn't work.

15:03.119 --> 15:05.513
You never said that.

15:05.556 --> 15:06.862
Now I got to go in there
and come clean with Andi

15:06.906 --> 15:09.256
before Joy thinks
she won a million dollars.

15:09.299 --> 15:11.258
Come on. Let me
do the talking.

15:11.301 --> 15:13.260
Bringing the mailbox, right?No! No!

15:13.303 --> 15:15.871
Put that down.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.699
Andi. Oh, oh, oh.

15:17.742 --> 15:19.440
Oh, good. Everyone's here.

15:19.483 --> 15:22.356
Adam, we're rich!

15:22.399 --> 15:25.968
Great. I'm so happy for you, I
need to be alone. Come on, Don.

15:26.012 --> 15:28.057
Wait. No. Wait, wait, wait.
Honey,

15:28.101 --> 15:29.798
you are not gonna believe this.

15:29.841 --> 15:31.452
Okay, you know that scratcher
I gave Joy?

15:31.495 --> 15:33.062
Never heard of it.
This is all new to me.

15:33.106 --> 15:35.021
I don't know about
Adam, though.

15:35.064 --> 15:37.023
We won a million bucks!

15:37.066 --> 15:40.809
Yeah. I bought a boat.

15:40.852 --> 15:43.507
It's so big, it's got a
little boat attached to it.

15:43.551 --> 15:44.944
And I...

15:44.987 --> 15:46.206
I quit my job.

15:46.249 --> 15:47.990
I said all kinds of
things to my boss.

15:48.034 --> 15:50.862
Religious, I got
a little racial.

15:50.906 --> 15:52.995
I burned bridges!

15:53.039 --> 15:55.084
Oh. Oh, that's good to hear.

15:55.128 --> 15:57.913
Can I... can I talk to you
for a second?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.001
What's going on?

15:59.045 --> 16:01.612
Joy and Rudy won
a million dollars!

16:01.656 --> 16:04.267
[overlapping chatter]

16:04.311 --> 16:06.095
This is gonna
change our life.

16:06.139 --> 16:08.184
We can move out of this
crappy neighborhood.

16:08.228 --> 16:09.707
RUDY:
Yeah.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.622
Yeah, somebody stole
our mailbox.

16:11.666 --> 16:14.843
And since you gave us
this scratcher,

16:14.886 --> 16:17.977
we want to give you
$100,000 of it.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.979
What?! [gasps]

16:20.022 --> 16:23.808
$100,000?
We're millionaires!

16:23.852 --> 16:26.028
Uh, Andi, I need
to talk to you.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.204
I-I-I... I really need
to talk to you right now.

16:28.248 --> 16:30.511
Oh.

16:30.554 --> 16:33.035
So, about this mailbox thief--
I was at the movies all day.

16:34.863 --> 16:37.648
What's going on?Joy's scratcher is a fake.

16:37.692 --> 16:39.215
What?!
Shh!

16:40.912 --> 16:43.437
Talking loud defeats the whole
purpose of coming over here!

16:47.093 --> 16:51.010
Joy's scratcher was a prank.
You got to help me.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.837
This will devastate Joy and
Rudy, and it's all your fault.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.056
Why should I help you?

16:54.100 --> 16:56.015
Because if Joy kills me,

16:56.058 --> 16:57.799
you're gonna have to raise
our children by yourself,

16:57.842 --> 17:00.454
and that will be exhausting!

17:00.497 --> 17:02.195
Adam.
Well, okay.

17:02.238 --> 17:04.284
You were right, okay?
I screwed up.

17:04.327 --> 17:06.982
I should have listened to you.
Pranks aren't fun.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.942
But if you please help me out
here, I will never do one again.

17:10.986 --> 17:12.944
Good.
Okay.

17:12.988 --> 17:15.817
Because April fools. [laughs]

17:18.385 --> 17:20.343
ALL:
April fools!

17:29.135 --> 17:31.093
This was all a prank?
You pranked me?

17:31.137 --> 17:33.704
And me.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.880
I-I think?

17:35.924 --> 17:37.882
I don't really
know what's going on.

17:37.926 --> 17:39.362
So I knew

17:39.406 --> 17:40.972
you couldn't quit
on your own,

17:41.016 --> 17:42.974
so I had the kids
bring you the scratcher.

17:43.018 --> 17:44.367
Which we knew
you wouldn't fall for.

17:44.411 --> 17:45.934
And because
you never put anything

17:45.977 --> 17:47.109
in the actual garbage can,

17:47.153 --> 17:48.806
I knew you'd leave it
lying around.

17:48.850 --> 17:50.547
So we told Mom
where you left it.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.984
And then I grabbed it, and
told you that I gave it to Joy.

17:53.028 --> 17:56.379
See, I used all the things
that I know about you, so,

17:56.423 --> 17:58.990
if you think about it...

18:01.428 --> 18:04.083
...it's like a love letter.

18:05.127 --> 18:08.913
[laughs, mutters]

18:10.915 --> 18:13.092
Okay, this is the last of it.
Fake toothpaste.

18:14.745 --> 18:17.879
Oh. Bug in the ice cube.
[laughing]: Oh.

18:17.922 --> 18:22.101
Aw. And this one hurts--
snakes in a can.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.582
Oh.

18:25.626 --> 18:27.715
Hey, well, I'm proud of you,

18:27.758 --> 18:32.372
but I still don't get why
you like this stuff so much.

18:32.415 --> 18:34.287
And don't say it's
because it's fun.

18:34.330 --> 18:37.464
Look, it's just a thing I always
loved doing with my dad.

18:37.507 --> 18:40.119
Most of the time
if he was talking to me,

18:40.162 --> 18:41.642
he was mad about something,

18:41.685 --> 18:44.688
but when we were doing pranks,
we were laughing.

18:44.732 --> 18:49.911
And when he'd put pudding
in my baseball glove,

18:49.954 --> 18:52.914
yeah, it was funny,
but it also meant

18:52.957 --> 18:55.046
that he knew I liked baseball.

18:55.090 --> 18:57.092
And pudding.

18:58.485 --> 19:00.400
Yeah, I was husky
for a while.
Mm.

19:00.443 --> 19:04.360
So in a way, it's how he
told you that he loved you.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.014
[gasps]

19:06.057 --> 19:08.234
I knew it was deep! Ha!

19:10.061 --> 19:13.587
The self-help aisle
is making a comeback!

19:13.630 --> 19:16.242
All right, all right.
Nobody likes a touchdown dance.

19:17.591 --> 19:20.202
Well, I know that you
love me and the kids

19:20.246 --> 19:23.379
because you say it
all the time, okay?

19:23.423 --> 19:25.773
So please don't show it
with pranks anymore.

19:25.816 --> 19:28.079
All right, you got it.
It's all in the trash now.

19:28.123 --> 19:31.039
Okay, good. All right, well, I'm
gonna make us a cup of tea...

19:31.082 --> 19:32.823
Mm.
...now that I know
it's safe again.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.668
[laughs]

19:53.148 --> 19:56.020
I f... I forgot about that one.

19:58.066 --> 20:01.591
[laughing]:
I put a rubber band
on the sprayer.

20:04.072 --> 20:05.421
I'll just go find my cowboy hat.

20:15.475 --> 20:18.434
Adam, we're gonna
be late. Come on!

20:23.439 --> 20:25.136
[laughter]

20:27.965 --> 20:31.099
I did that.
I dressed him.

20:32.318 --> 20:35.625
You look like Roy Rogers' wife.[laughter]

20:35.669 --> 20:37.279
You told me
nobody would be here.

20:37.323 --> 20:40.151
Huh. I guess I do like pranks.

20:41.762 --> 20:42.893
Come on, let's go.

20:44.155 --> 20:47.202
Just relax and let it happen.
