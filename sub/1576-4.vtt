00:01.935 --> 00:03.702
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

00:03.704 --> 00:05.270
(drill whirring, banging)

00:06.873 --> 00:08.374
Hey!

00:08.376 --> 00:09.775
Oh, hey, morning, berta.

00:09.777 --> 00:12.978
Little warning, man at work.

00:12.980 --> 00:15.547
Doing a little banging
and screwing.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.783
Little warning for you.

00:17.785 --> 00:22.354
Woman at bar until 2:00 a.M.
Doing the same thing.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.622
What are you doing?

00:23.624 --> 00:26.525
I am baby-proofing
the house.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.460
It's a requirement
of the adoption agency,

00:28.462 --> 00:29.695
And it's a good thing, too.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.463
This here kitchen
is a death trap.

00:31.465 --> 00:34.700
Whole mess of things up in here
that can kill someone.

00:34.702 --> 00:39.071
We got knives, we got fire,
poison, scalding hot water,

00:39.073 --> 00:41.407
Alan's leftover fish tacos.

00:41.409 --> 00:43.042
You worry too much.

00:43.044 --> 00:46.378
Jake ate a steady diet
of floor wax and detergent,

00:46.380 --> 00:49.548
And he turned out...

00:49.550 --> 00:51.817
Yeah, maybe it's not a bad idea.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.652
I locked all the cabinets
and the drawers,

00:53.654 --> 00:55.988
Put these safety knobs
on the stove,

00:55.990 --> 00:57.389
And if you want to access
any chemicals,

00:57.391 --> 00:59.591
You will need
a special magnetic key.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.493
Oh, by the way,
when you're doing the laundry,

01:01.495 --> 01:03.629
Keep your eye out
for a special magnetic key.

01:05.432 --> 01:07.900
Why would you need
to lock the towel drawer?

01:07.902 --> 01:10.869
You hide your pot
in the medicine cabinet.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.237
I'm guessing.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.373
That is no ordinary
towel drawer.

01:14.375 --> 01:18.043
That's the first step
on the stairway to disaster.

01:18.045 --> 01:19.778
Oh, I'm too hungover
for this crap.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.747
Okay, okay.

01:21.749 --> 01:25.717
All right, imagine, if you will,
child pulls out the drawer,

01:25.719 --> 01:29.121
Climbs up onto the counter
and toddles over to the window

01:29.123 --> 01:30.722
That has been left open

01:30.724 --> 01:33.425
Because alan finds the smell
of steaming broccoli

01:33.427 --> 01:34.493
To be "gaggy."

01:35.929 --> 01:37.229
Whereupon, the child

01:37.231 --> 01:39.798
Spots a beautiful kite,

01:39.800 --> 01:43.435
Most likely in the shape
of a butterfly or a pikachu.

01:43.437 --> 01:46.238
The child reaches
for the kite,

01:46.240 --> 01:48.540
Tumbles out the window,

01:48.542 --> 01:51.410
Bounces off the awning,
flying through the air,

01:51.412 --> 01:55.380
Heading toward certain death,
when, miraculously, it is caught

01:55.382 --> 01:58.350
By a shirtless
matthew mcconaughey.

02:00.053 --> 02:02.454
"don't worry,
your baby's gonna be all right,

02:02.456 --> 02:04.223
All right, all right."

02:05.625 --> 02:06.592
Yeah, sure.

02:06.594 --> 02:07.993
You know what,
we got lucky this time,

02:07.995 --> 02:10.996
But we can't depend
on mcconaughey every time.

02:10.998 --> 02:15.267
Okay, I'm gonna have to start
hiding the pot from you.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.069
Better safe than sorry.

02:17.071 --> 02:19.571
Every stairway, every toilet,
every sharp corner

02:19.573 --> 02:21.473
Has been locked,
latched or padded.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.542
No one is getting hurt
in this house.

02:25.078 --> 02:26.411
(screams)

02:26.413 --> 02:27.846
Hot!

02:27.848 --> 02:29.915
Hot! Hot!

02:34.654 --> 02:37.523
All right, all right,
all right.

02:39.459 --> 02:41.994
â™ª men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men â™ª

02:41.996 --> 02:45.364
â™ª ah.
â™ª men.
â™ª men.

02:49.502 --> 02:50.536
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

02:50.538 --> 02:52.437
So, as you can see,

02:52.439 --> 02:54.206
I installed a gate
at the top of the stairs,

02:54.208 --> 02:56.508
At the bottom of the stairs,
and as an extra precaution,

02:56.510 --> 02:58.443
I put one in the middle
of the stairs.

02:58.445 --> 02:59.878
Overachiever.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.848
I think he's just trying
to keep me from getting away.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.049
(chuckles)

03:04.051 --> 03:06.518
Well, you did a great job
baby-proofing.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.620
I can't imagine anyone
getting hurt in this house.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.723
Really? Try telling me
I look fat in these jeans.

03:13.159 --> 03:15.994
Okay, flame off,
human torch.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.564
So, uh, so, what do we do next?

03:18.566 --> 03:20.299
Oh, well, it's pretty simple.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.667
I walk out onto the deck,

03:21.669 --> 03:23.502
You put a pile of hundreds
on the table,

03:23.504 --> 03:25.370
I come back,
slip them into my purse,

03:25.372 --> 03:26.605
And you get a kid.

03:27.807 --> 03:31.410
I have $5,000 in the bottom
of a toolbox in the garage.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.544
I was joking.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.646
As was I.

03:35.848 --> 03:38.183
Anyway, uh,
I wasn't gonna say anything

03:38.185 --> 03:40.018
Until you guys passed
the inspection,

03:40.020 --> 03:42.154
But it looks like
we may have found

03:42.156 --> 03:43.689
A potential match
for the two of you.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.524
(gasps)

03:45.526 --> 03:46.758
We're...

03:46.760 --> 03:48.594
We're getting a baby.

03:48.596 --> 03:49.595
Are you serious?
This is unbelievable.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.029
Well, slow down;
all that's happened so far

03:51.031 --> 03:52.431
Is a pregnant mother has seen
your profile

03:52.433 --> 03:53.565
And wants to meet you.

03:53.567 --> 03:57.035
Somebody saw my profile
and wants to meet me?

03:57.037 --> 03:59.538
That's so different
than the dating sites.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.073
I can't believe this.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.741
Who is she?
Where is she from?

04:02.743 --> 04:04.509
How old is she? Is she
having a boy or a girl?

04:04.511 --> 04:06.078
Wait, no, la-la-la-la-la!

04:06.080 --> 04:07.613
I don't want to know.
I want to be surprised.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.248
Walden, you're getting ahead
of yourself.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.249
Did you say girl?

04:10.251 --> 04:11.583
I thought I heard
you say girl.

04:12.552 --> 04:13.552
Wait, no, you know what?

04:13.554 --> 04:14.620
Doesn't matter.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.054
Ten fingers and ten toes--

04:16.056 --> 04:18.457
That's all that matters.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.692
Are you not saying anything
'cause it's a boy?

04:20.694 --> 04:22.628
Oh, my god,
we're having a boy!

04:22.630 --> 04:23.562
Okay, walden,

04:23.564 --> 04:24.763
When you meet the mother,

04:24.765 --> 04:26.665
You want to come off as a calm,
stable father.

04:27.734 --> 04:28.800
Not like a 14-year-old girl

04:28.802 --> 04:30.802
At a justin bieber concert.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.437
Sorry,
we're just really excited.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.239
No, I get it.
I'm excited for you.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.807
I'll call you
when the meeting is set up.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.042
Oh, and by the way,

04:37.044 --> 04:39.444
I think you look fantastic
in those jeans.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.113
Girl, we are gonna be bffs.

04:41.115 --> 04:42.781
(chuckles)

04:43.716 --> 04:45.717
We're gonna have a baby.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.319
We're gonna have a baby.

04:47.321 --> 04:48.620
We're gonna have a baby.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.756
Both (laughing):
We're gonna have a baby!

04:50.758 --> 04:52.724
We're gonna have a baby!

04:52.726 --> 04:54.159
Oh, we have to celebrate.

04:54.161 --> 04:55.494
Uh, I'll go to the garage
and get some champagne.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.429
Great! We're gonna have a baby!

04:57.431 --> 04:58.830
We're gonna have a...

04:58.832 --> 05:00.899
Wait, we don't have champagne
in the garage.

05:00.901 --> 05:01.967
(gasps) my toolbox!

05:01.969 --> 05:03.435
Alan!

05:03.437 --> 05:05.704
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

05:07.140 --> 05:08.907
Here.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.976
I got this for you.

05:12.679 --> 05:13.612
Why?

05:13.614 --> 05:15.180
I think it would be nice

05:15.182 --> 05:17.349
If we wore matching sweaters
to meet the birth mom.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.617
Twinsies.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.085
We're supposed to be
a married couple,

05:20.087 --> 05:22.487
Not half of
a barbershop quartet.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.956
Can't we be both?

05:24.958 --> 05:27.592
â™ª miss mcmartin,
bring me a kid â™ª

05:27.594 --> 05:28.794
â™ª bom-bom-bom-bom

05:28.796 --> 05:31.263
â™ª marrying you
was a dumb thing I did â™ª

05:31.265 --> 05:32.431
â™ª bom-bom-bom-bom.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.399
You were flat.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.703
So, the mom--
you think she's hot?

05:38.638 --> 05:40.639
She's nine months pregnant!

05:40.641 --> 05:41.807
I know.

05:41.809 --> 05:44.009
Love me some preggos.

05:45.044 --> 05:47.012
38-62-38.

05:47.014 --> 05:50.215
Baby got back and front.

05:50.217 --> 05:52.317
Okay, listen.

05:52.319 --> 05:55.220
If we want this girl
to give us her baby,

05:55.222 --> 05:57.289
She has to think that
we're a well-adjusted couple.

05:57.291 --> 05:59.291
If she gets a creepy vibe
off of you,

05:59.293 --> 06:00.859
She's gonna turn and run
the other way.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.294
And I'm only saying this

06:02.296 --> 06:04.296
'cause I'm getting a creepy vibe
off of you.

06:04.298 --> 06:05.797
(doorbell rings)

06:07.333 --> 06:09.668
Says the guy who googled
"helen mirren nip slip."

06:09.670 --> 06:11.903
Helen is timeless.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.372
Now, listen.

06:13.374 --> 06:14.673
If you mess this up for me,

06:14.675 --> 06:16.842
I will make your life
a living hell.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.777
Now, remember,
we love each other.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.283
Hello, mama.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.819
Hi.

06:27.821 --> 06:28.887
Hi, you must be kathy.

06:28.889 --> 06:32.524
Yes, uh, welcome to
our malibu dream house.

06:32.526 --> 06:33.925
He's ken.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.328
Oh, I guess that
makes me barbie.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.864
I'm walden.

06:38.866 --> 06:39.998
This is alan.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.433
(stammering)
come in.

06:41.435 --> 06:42.567
Here, c-can I take your coat?

06:42.569 --> 06:43.735
Oh, thank you.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.070
(chuckles)

06:45.072 --> 06:46.872
Wow!

06:46.874 --> 06:48.206
Look at you!

06:48.208 --> 06:50.375
So very pregnant.

06:50.377 --> 06:51.610
Coat.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.512
I know.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.547
I haven't seen
my feet since July.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.682
Am I wearing matching shoes?

06:57.684 --> 06:59.351
Um...

06:59.353 --> 07:00.552
Actually, no.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.621
Uh, but you know what, it works.
It's cute.

07:02.623 --> 07:03.722
Um, please sit.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.457
Yeah, please.
How you feeling?

07:05.459 --> 07:07.092
My ankles are swollen,

07:07.094 --> 07:09.528
My back hurts,
and forget about my breasts.

07:09.530 --> 07:12.531
I haven't even noticed,
you know, 'cause I'm gay.

07:12.533 --> 07:13.799
That's... (clears throat)

07:13.801 --> 07:15.967
That's my rainbow warrior.

07:15.969 --> 07:18.437
Always waving his flag.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.472
Even when it relates
to nothing.

07:20.474 --> 07:24.276
Um, so, uh,
tell us about kathy.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.244
I think the first thing
you should know about me

07:26.246 --> 07:28.880
Is this is not representative
of who I am.

07:28.882 --> 07:29.915
See, I just graduated

07:29.917 --> 07:31.650
From ucla.

07:31.652 --> 07:34.953
The baby is a result
of a spring break trip to vegas.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.556
Ah. I guess what happens
in vegas

07:37.558 --> 07:39.124
Stays in kathy.

07:40.793 --> 07:43.328
Yep, took me about six weeks
to figure out

07:43.330 --> 07:44.663
That my morning sickness

07:44.665 --> 07:47.132
Wasn't just
a really bad hangover.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.633
Well, we all make mistakes.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.735
One morning,
I woke up married to this one.

07:50.737 --> 07:52.771
(laughs)

07:52.773 --> 07:55.907
See, bottom line, this wasn't
part of my five-year plan.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.343
You know, law school,
clerk for a judge,

07:58.345 --> 07:59.611
Start my own practice.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.246
Wow, that's-that's impressive.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.114
Uh, alan's son, jake,

08:03.116 --> 08:05.350
Had a five-year plan
for the tenth grade.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.952
(chuckles)

08:06.954 --> 08:08.520
See, that's why I liked
your profile.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.589
You have parenting experience.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.491
Your sense of humor
came through.

08:12.493 --> 08:14.626
And I kind of love
that you're gay.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.595
Not as much as we do.

08:16.597 --> 08:17.996
Right, wally bear?

08:17.998 --> 08:20.065
That's right, alley cat.

08:21.467 --> 08:24.536
Even though I'm not gonna
be part of the baby's life,

08:24.538 --> 08:27.005
I like the idea of being
the only mom.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.807
I can totally understand that.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.943
Probably because my mom was an
ice-cold, sharp-tongue alcoholic

08:31.945 --> 08:35.046
Who preferred shopping and spas
over spending time with me.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.449
And I can
totally understand <i>that.</i>

08:37.451 --> 08:39.551
So, tell me about you.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.853
What made you guys decide
to start a family?

08:41.855 --> 08:44.489
Uh, well, raising my son

08:44.491 --> 08:47.158
Was one of the greatest
experiences of my life,

08:47.160 --> 08:49.361
And I just wanted walden
to feel that same joy.

08:50.463 --> 08:52.497
Yeah, I mean, for me
it's a couple reasons.

08:52.499 --> 08:55.200
I-I felt like something
was missing in my life,

08:55.202 --> 08:57.536
And I wanted to give back,

08:57.538 --> 09:01.406
And having a kid will allow me
to drive in the carpool lane.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.874
(laughs)

09:02.876 --> 09:05.310
It's nice to laugh again.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.846
Except I just peed a little
on your sofa.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.214
I'll get you something.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.449
Oh, uh, actually,
I got something right here.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.985
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

09:13.987 --> 09:14.986
(gasps)

09:14.988 --> 09:16.154
The baby just kicked.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.522
I felt it.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.057
Oh, looks like someone's got

09:19.059 --> 09:20.725
A little soccer star in there.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.794
God, you smell good.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.032
Alan, you want to come up
for some air?

09:27.034 --> 09:28.400
Oh, sorry.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.402
Just got excited. (chuckles)

09:30.404 --> 09:31.937
About the baby.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.872
Sure.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.273
So, uh, kathy,

09:35.275 --> 09:37.609
Uh, do you know
if it's a boy or a girl?

09:37.611 --> 09:39.344
I don't, but your profile said

09:39.346 --> 09:41.580
You didn't have
a gender preference, right?

09:41.582 --> 09:42.681
Oh, that's right.

09:42.683 --> 09:45.016
Just like me in my 20s.
(chuckles)

09:45.018 --> 09:47.352
You guys crack me up.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.421
You're gonna make great dads.

09:49.423 --> 09:51.856
Oh, world's greatest, according
the coffee mugs I bought.

09:51.858 --> 09:56.061
Well, that's good,
because I made up my mind.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.762
I want you to have my baby.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.230
No!
Yes.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.899
Oh, my god!
You did not just say that!

10:00.901 --> 10:02.267
You bitch!

10:03.202 --> 10:04.569
Thank you, kathy.

10:04.571 --> 10:05.971
Thank you, vegas.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.073
Thank you, broken condom.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.641
Well, you can thank
two-for-one tequila shots

10:09.643 --> 10:11.876
At the tropicana.
(chuckles)

10:11.878 --> 10:13.144
Let's not forget
this little guy.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.813
(chuckles)

10:14.815 --> 10:16.881
(gasps)
do you feel it moving?

10:16.883 --> 10:18.617
I can feel it growing.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.619
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

10:24.123 --> 10:25.924
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

10:25.926 --> 10:27.659
Okay, best shower gift:

10:27.661 --> 10:30.161
Barry. Baby's first bong.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.296
Yep.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.797
And just like the kid's diaper,

10:32.799 --> 10:36.001
It's full of
stinky green stuff.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.335
The pizza's on its way.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.471
In the meantime, uh,
who wants a beer?

10:39.473 --> 10:41.906
Oh, wow.
Yeah.

10:41.908 --> 10:43.642
There we go.

10:43.644 --> 10:46.511
Walden, you are gonna
make a great dad.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.646
Hey.
And, alan,

10:47.648 --> 10:48.747
You've already raised jake,

10:48.749 --> 10:51.850
So I guess just...
Do the opposite.

10:53.953 --> 10:56.087
I still can't believe
it's even possible

10:56.089 --> 10:58.089
For two men to have a baby.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.858
What an age we live in.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.526
Science, right?

11:03.696 --> 11:07.666
Larry, we're-we're not
actually having a baby.

11:07.668 --> 11:08.967
We're adopting.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.169
Ah, shooting blanks, huh?

11:13.172 --> 11:14.506
Well, I guess
if alan gets pregnant,

11:14.508 --> 11:16.174
You'll know he's been
cheating on you.

11:18.377 --> 11:20.178
So you two are
really married, huh?

11:20.180 --> 11:21.780
Yep.
Yeah, crazy, isn't it?

11:21.782 --> 11:23.548
No, I'll tell you what's crazy.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.950
You have never
hit on me once, walden.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.019
I mean, we worked together
every day, side by side,

11:28.021 --> 11:30.021
And not so much as
a lingering glance

11:30.023 --> 11:32.357
Or a "gee, you look
nice today, barry.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.992
"you lost a little weight,
barry?

11:33.994 --> 11:37.062
Those cargo shorts really
flatter your calves, barry."

11:37.064 --> 11:38.196
No, man.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.999
We got married
so I could adopt a baby.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.168
That... We're a pretend couple.

11:43.170 --> 11:46.337
It's kind of like your
"girlfriend in canada."

11:46.339 --> 11:48.073
(scoffs)

11:48.075 --> 11:49.974
Okay, olivia is real.

11:49.976 --> 11:52.711
I mean, just... Okay, look at
these nude photos she sent me.

11:53.679 --> 11:55.814
That's jennifer lawrence.

11:55.816 --> 11:58.249
She gets that all the time.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.921
In a couple days,
I'm gonna be a dad.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.322
(laughs)

12:04.324 --> 12:06.324
I'm gonna be
completely responsible

12:06.326 --> 12:09.060
For the emotional
and financial well-being

12:09.062 --> 12:10.729
Of someone who is
completely incapable

12:10.731 --> 12:12.163
Of taking care of themselves.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.332
Thank you for being
my test baby.

12:16.268 --> 12:18.503
I'd keep my fingers
crossed for a boy.

12:18.505 --> 12:19.270
Why?

12:19.272 --> 12:20.839
Well, basic math.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.841
If you have a boy, you only
have to worry about one penis.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.676
You have a girl, you have
to worry about them all.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.080
Either way,
you're gonna love it.

12:29.082 --> 12:32.050
Being a father is
the best thing in the world.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.251
How old are your kids?

12:33.253 --> 12:34.619
Well, my son is 15

12:34.621 --> 12:37.322
And my secret daughter
is going to be 11 this year.

12:38.691 --> 12:39.958
Your... Your
secret daughter?

12:39.960 --> 12:43.128
Yeah, she looks a lot
like my secret wife.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.436
You know, kids are amazing.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.139
You know? You get to pass
all this knowledge down

12:54.141 --> 12:57.275
To this little person
and-and shape their mind.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.144
Like, you know,
how to talk to girls

12:59.146 --> 13:01.713
And how to be there for
your friends when they need you.

13:01.715 --> 13:03.081
Oh, you can teach them
your ability

13:03.083 --> 13:06.317
To always be in the bathroom
whenever the dinner check comes.

13:07.286 --> 13:10.255
That's pure instinct.

13:10.257 --> 13:13.158
Can't be taught.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.293
(phone ringing)

13:15.295 --> 13:17.896
You know, all my memories
revolve around my dad.

13:17.898 --> 13:21.466
The time he threw my tamagotchi
down the garbage disposal.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.302
Time he made a pass
at my prom date.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.539
Time he divorced my mom
and married my prom date.

13:30.176 --> 13:31.242
Walden:
Guys.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.011
Guys, it's
the hospital.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.813
Oh, if it's one of
my patients, I'm not here.

13:35.748 --> 13:36.948
Oh, don't worry.
If I'm your

13:36.950 --> 13:38.183
Kid's doctor,
I won't do that.

13:39.084 --> 13:41.119
It's what you say.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.087
Kathy's in labor!

13:43.089 --> 13:44.088
We got to go!

13:44.090 --> 13:45.089
I'll get an uber.

13:45.091 --> 13:46.291
I'll go grab the car seat.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.192
I'll get the
diaper bag.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.193
(doorbell rings)

13:48.195 --> 13:50.261
Oh, god, that's the pizza guy.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.296
Um... Hey, alan,

13:51.298 --> 13:52.363
Could you pay
the pizza guy?

13:52.365 --> 13:54.532
Alan:
I'm in the bathroom!

13:54.534 --> 13:56.701
How does he do it?

13:59.338 --> 14:01.940
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

14:01.942 --> 14:04.275
Hey, you know,
I-I appreciate you guys coming,

14:04.277 --> 14:05.777
But you really
don't have to stay.

14:05.779 --> 14:07.645
Are you kidding?
We want to be here.

14:07.647 --> 14:08.980
You know what
they say.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.216
"to raise a child, it
takes the village people."

14:11.218 --> 14:13.218
Hey, guys?

14:13.220 --> 14:15.286
I think I may have
gotten way too high.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.855
Can somebody take me
to the hospital?

14:16.857 --> 14:18.857
You're in a hospital.

14:18.859 --> 14:20.325
(gasps)

14:20.327 --> 14:21.526
Whoa.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.594
How'd you do that?

14:23.629 --> 14:25.697
I wonder why
we haven't heard anything.

14:25.699 --> 14:28.566
They took kathy to the delivery
room, like, an hour ago.

14:28.568 --> 14:31.002
Sometimes the baby just
doesn't want to come out.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.570
I mean, put yourself
in its position.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.305
For nine months,
you've been floating

14:34.307 --> 14:38.476
Then somebody opens a trap door,
all the water flows out,

14:38.478 --> 14:41.379
A set of salad tongs grabs you
by the head and yanks you out,

14:41.381 --> 14:43.181
And then some guy
you never seen before

14:43.183 --> 14:44.983
Starts slapping
you on the ass.

14:44.985 --> 14:47.652
Reminds me of a trip
I took to tijuana once.

14:49.989 --> 14:52.390
Walden: Aw, look at how cute
that one is.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.025
Yeah, she's got
a nice rack, too.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.427
What are you looking at?

14:56.429 --> 14:59.163
The hot nurse.
What are you looking at?

14:59.165 --> 15:00.698
That baby.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.301
Ugh! You guys are sick.

15:05.938 --> 15:08.106
So have you guys decided
on a name for the baby yet?

15:08.108 --> 15:09.941
Oh, no, not yet.
No.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.075
It's such a big
responsibility.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.543
I don't want
to give him a name

15:12.545 --> 15:14.012
That other kids
can make fun of.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.214
Well, bad news.
Every name can be made fun of.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.782
That's not true.

15:17.784 --> 15:18.783
Really?

15:18.785 --> 15:20.418
How's your pond, walden?

15:21.887 --> 15:24.956
It's an intellectual insult,
but it still stings.

15:26.392 --> 15:29.260
I was "larry the fairy"
all through high school.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.363
Oh, no way!
I was "barry the fairy."

15:32.365 --> 15:35.300
Somebody noticed
that you could rearrange

15:35.302 --> 15:36.901
The letters of "alan,"
and I became

15:36.903 --> 15:39.404
"little anal harper."

15:39.406 --> 15:40.271
My name's "herb."

15:40.273 --> 15:41.773
Kids skipped the clever puns

15:41.775 --> 15:43.908
And just shoved my head
down a toilet.

15:43.910 --> 15:46.377
Well, I'm sure
there are plenty of names

15:46.379 --> 15:48.212
That kids can't
make jokes about.

15:48.214 --> 15:50.615
Mr. And mr. Harper-schmidt?

15:50.617 --> 15:52.250
Yeah, nothing to
worry about there.

15:52.252 --> 15:55.420
Just the hyphenated last name
of the two gay dads.

15:55.422 --> 15:56.587
So how's kathy?

15:56.589 --> 15:58.122
She's doing fine.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.258
So is your brand-new baby boy.

16:00.260 --> 16:03.061
Oh, my god,
we got a boy!

16:03.063 --> 16:05.730
I get a do-over for jake!

16:05.732 --> 16:08.466
I only have to worry
about one penis!

16:08.468 --> 16:10.234
I like to wear
women's underwear!

16:10.236 --> 16:12.403
What?

16:12.405 --> 16:15.873
I thought we were
confessing things.

16:17.409 --> 16:19.310
Nurse:
There he is.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.979
All:
Aw...

16:22.948 --> 16:25.350
He's got your nose
and alan's eyes.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.086
Larry, I told you
before that...

16:29.154 --> 16:32.023
Thank you, larry.

16:32.025 --> 16:34.425
Alan: Look at him.
He's so amazing.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.094
Walden: I can't think of
anything more beautiful

16:36.096 --> 16:37.462
Than what I'm looking
at right now.

16:37.464 --> 16:40.164
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
It's true,
that's the truth.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.367
But how much more
beautiful would it be

16:42.369 --> 16:44.769
If those two nurses just
started making out right now?

16:44.771 --> 16:47.438
Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.507
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

16:51.643 --> 16:53.177
Alan:
Hey.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.479
How you doing?

16:54.481 --> 16:56.381
I'm good.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.849
Tired.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.484
Sore.

16:59.486 --> 17:02.053
Look at this little guy.

17:02.055 --> 17:03.388
Can I hold him?

17:03.390 --> 17:04.856
Uh, sure.

17:07.726 --> 17:10.528
Oh, he is the cutest thing ever.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.397
Mm-hmm.

17:12.399 --> 17:14.799
Hey, hey... High-five.

17:14.801 --> 17:15.867
You can owe me.

17:15.869 --> 17:17.235
(chuckles)

17:17.237 --> 17:19.971
Welcome to the world,
little buddy.

17:19.973 --> 17:21.873
We're gonna have
so much fun.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.708
We're gonna go to
ball games together

17:23.710 --> 17:25.410
And go swimming together

17:25.412 --> 17:29.180
And pick up chick... Ens
together.

17:29.182 --> 17:31.349
Smile. Come on.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.384
Okay, uh...

17:33.386 --> 17:36.087
Oh, oh, oh.
Look at that picture.

17:36.089 --> 17:38.723
The two most handsome
men in the world.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.758
And they're both mine.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.427
(baby crying)
oh, oh...

17:42.429 --> 17:43.528
Oh, what's the matter?

17:43.530 --> 17:45.196
Uh, maybe he wants his mommy.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.364
Oh, all right,
come here, little buddy.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.766
Uh, I think he might be hungry.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.168
Oh, of course.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.436
Oh, yeah, of course.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.004
Okay, here.

17:53.006 --> 17:55.406
There.

17:55.408 --> 17:58.209
I miss him already.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.111
Yeah, it's hard to let him go.

18:02.347 --> 18:04.415
Actually, it's impossible.

18:05.784 --> 18:07.285
Oh.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.153
I am so sorry.

18:10.789 --> 18:12.523
Wait. What, uh...
What just happened?

18:12.525 --> 18:14.358
Did I... Did I
miss something?

18:16.695 --> 18:19.097
She's keeping the baby.

18:19.099 --> 18:21.032
Uh...

18:21.034 --> 18:23.234
But what-what
about law school?

18:23.236 --> 18:24.802
The-the five-year plan?

18:24.804 --> 18:27.939
After I saw this little guy...

18:27.941 --> 18:29.540
The plan changed.

18:31.376 --> 18:35.913
I mean, before, I couldn't
imagine my life with him.

18:35.915 --> 18:38.583
Now I can't imagine it
without him.

18:38.585 --> 18:41.786
But... But he's gonna
be a great dad.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.554
Alan...
No, no.
H-he loves him.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.556
Alan, it's...

18:45.558 --> 18:47.492
Okay, let's-let's just
approach this practically.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.127
Um... How much for the kid?

18:49.129 --> 18:50.394
Uh, I have, uh,

18:50.396 --> 18:51.896
I have $32 on me.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.898
I'm gonna need three dollars
for dinner at ampm,

18:53.900 --> 18:55.066
But the rest is yours.

18:55.068 --> 18:57.001
Believe me, I feel terrible.

18:57.003 --> 18:58.669
You feel terrible?

18:58.671 --> 19:01.572
We're-we're gonna be driving
home with an empty car seat.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.641
And you know what's waiting
for us when we get there?

19:03.643 --> 19:05.810
An empty nursery.
An empty crib.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.345
An empty... Uh, uh....

19:07.347 --> 19:08.513
What's that swedish thing

19:08.515 --> 19:10.348
That, uh, that you
wear like a pouch,

19:10.350 --> 19:12.683
To carry your baby
around like a kangaroo?

19:12.685 --> 19:13.751
Bjorn.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.186
An empty bjorn!

19:15.188 --> 19:17.688
An empty blue baby bjorn!

19:17.690 --> 19:20.458
Hard to say,
but even harder to face.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.493
Alan, just... Stop.

19:23.462 --> 19:24.929
It's okay.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.799
I wouldn't be able
to give him up either,

19:28.801 --> 19:30.368
So I don't blame you.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.536
Really?

19:31.538 --> 19:33.704
I get it.
You're his mom.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.107
I'm so sorry to put you
through all this.

19:36.109 --> 19:37.675
Don't be sorry.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.311
He's... Lucky.

19:40.313 --> 19:43.080
You're both...
Very lucky.

19:45.884 --> 19:48.653
This man is a saint.

19:48.655 --> 19:49.654
A damn saint.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.022
Let's go.

19:51.990 --> 19:53.991
Say good-bye, elliot.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.893
More like "smelliot."

19:55.895 --> 19:58.129
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

20:01.500 --> 20:02.500

20:02.502 --> 20:04.669
You doing okay?

20:04.671 --> 20:07.171
Yeah.

20:07.173 --> 20:09.073
Can you show me
the picture of him?

20:09.075 --> 20:10.875
Oh, please, don't put yourself
through this.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.843
Come on, just
one more time.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.345
Okay.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.414
Here.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.319
Look at him.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.820
He's perfect.

20:25.524 --> 20:29.026
I'm sorry this didn't work out
as planned.

20:29.028 --> 20:32.063
He still owes me a high-five.

20:33.031 --> 20:34.532
Don't worry.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.567
We'll find our kid.

20:38.537 --> 20:40.705
I know.

20:40.707 --> 20:44.742
In the meantime,
you're still married to me.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.577
(sobbing)

20:46.579 --> 20:48.646
Yes, I am.

20:50.582 --> 20:54.652
Why couldn't kathy take you
and give me the baby?!
