WEBVTT

00:11.010 --> 00:13.430
TATEANA CITY, MARIUS HILLS

00:23.189 --> 00:25.692
That's where Dad died.

00:25.775 --> 00:28.194
Yeah. My mom and dad too.

00:29.612 --> 00:31.698
What? Who's there?

00:39.581 --> 00:42.792
You can no longer persuade the comet.
What a shame.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.085
EPISODE 5: A STORY ENDS

00:44.169 --> 00:46.504
Why are you doing this?
Humanity will go extinct.

00:46.588 --> 00:50.550
On the contrary. Humanity will go extinct
if the comet doesn't strike.

00:50.633 --> 00:52.802
Nasa, what are you doing?

00:52.886 --> 00:57.390
Mayor, aren't you always going on about
how we need to think about humankind?

00:58.224 --> 01:01.311
I've been thinking very hard about this.

01:02.854 --> 01:05.398
Sorry,
but I'm going to have to destroy this.

01:09.611 --> 01:10.820
Ouch!

01:10.904 --> 01:13.990
-What are you doing, you pervert?
-Sorry.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.825
Watch it, Taiyou.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.203
I have a gun, and it's dangerous.

01:23.708 --> 01:26.377
Geez,
kids nowadays are so unkind to us ladies.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.755
Konoha, run!

01:33.134 --> 01:35.303
LARGEST IMPACT CRATER ON MARS

01:41.559 --> 01:43.645
Not Touya too.

01:43.728 --> 01:46.356
What are you doing? I'm injured. Ouch.

01:47.065 --> 01:49.359
Okay, everyone. Don't do anything stupid.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.612
What a relief. It's not damaged.

01:52.695 --> 01:57.617
Even if it reboots, we can't connect
to the comet with that cable.

01:58.201 --> 02:01.913
We would already be done
if I had just destroyed Dakky.

02:01.996 --> 02:03.498
What should I do?

02:03.581 --> 02:05.416
Right.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.586
I have to make it impossible
to connect to the comet.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.380
I need to break the antenna.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.674
RECORDING: OFF-LINE

02:16.636 --> 02:18.805
Nasa is accessing Kibo.

02:18.888 --> 02:21.057
She's going to destroy the ICS antenna.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.892
Nasa! You idiot!

02:24.144 --> 02:26.062
What the hell are you trying to do?

02:26.146 --> 02:28.439
I always thought you were stupid,

02:28.523 --> 02:30.608
but you're actually
an extra level of stupid.

02:30.692 --> 02:33.736
She just tried to shoot me.
I thought we were friends.

02:34.487 --> 02:35.905
-Mina.
-Yeah?

02:35.989 --> 02:38.533
-I kinda peed myself.
-Me too.

02:38.616 --> 02:40.243
Good thing we're in diapers.

02:41.870 --> 02:44.330
-Konoha, are you okay?
-Yeah.

02:44.914 --> 02:47.876
<i>Touya. Nasa's goal</i>
<i>is to destroy the ICS antenna--</i>

02:50.128 --> 02:53.047
I see.
So she wants to destroy the antenna.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.550
<i>Nasa is connecting to the ICS antenna.</i>

02:55.633 --> 02:56.885
Fight back.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.930
<i>I can't. She's using an unknown pathway.</i>

03:01.014 --> 03:02.015
<i>Testing, testing.</i>

03:02.098 --> 03:04.309
<i>Everything has already been decided</i>
<i>in the </i>Seven Poem<i>,</i>

03:04.392 --> 03:06.644
<i>so don't any of you try anything stupid.</i>

03:06.728 --> 03:08.438
Block all of Nasa's pathways.

03:08.521 --> 03:12.942
Damn it. The peer comm on the wall's
been eaten away, so we can't connect.

03:13.943 --> 03:17.530
Stop thrashing about.
Stop your pointless resistance.

03:18.615 --> 03:21.784
It connected. I know the password.

03:22.493 --> 03:24.954
They won't be able to do much--

03:25.038 --> 03:26.372
What are you doing?

03:26.998 --> 03:29.042
This is why I hate kids.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.297
She fried the peer comm.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.258
You won't be able to do anything
if the peer comm is destroyed.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.764
There's no peer comm.
Where's the attack coming from?

03:42.847 --> 03:46.809
How can someone named "Nasa"
be a terrorist?

03:46.893 --> 03:48.478
As an American, I'm offended.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.563
<i>It's obviously a fake name.</i>

03:50.647 --> 03:52.649
<i>I'm a mysterious superhacker after all.</i>

03:52.732 --> 03:54.984
She heard that?

03:56.236 --> 03:59.072
Damn, they blocked the pathway.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.699
If we don't reduce
the number of humans now,

04:01.783 --> 04:05.119
Earth's environment will collapse
and everyone will die.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.705
This is the only alternative
to avoid that.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.833
Isn't it better for one-third to die
instead of everybody?

04:10.917 --> 04:12.752
What is she talking about?

04:12.835 --> 04:16.297
This is humanity's last chance.
Do you understand?

04:16.381 --> 04:19.342
It was written about in the <i>Seven Poem</i>
many years ago.

04:20.510 --> 04:23.137
UN2 never believed the poem.
That's why they couldn't decode it.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.222
REBOOT FAILED

04:25.640 --> 04:29.894
However, we in John Doe
believed that the poem was correct,

04:29.978 --> 04:31.980
which is why we succeeded
in deciphering it.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.564
Those who believe will be saved!

04:34.649 --> 04:37.485
Damn it. I can't use the peer comm.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.946
Just like Seven,

04:40.029 --> 04:42.615
that comet is made
from fourth-gen "S" Patterns.

04:42.699 --> 04:46.369
That's why we've built Seven again
with the comet.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.580
If the Seven before was the First Seven,

04:49.664 --> 04:52.583
the comet is the Second Seven,
so to speak.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.377
Second Seven?

04:54.961 --> 05:00.133
Humanity could not solve climate change
or the population crisis on its own.

05:00.216 --> 05:02.885
We had to rely on an AI, an outsider.

05:03.761 --> 05:07.056
<i>UN1 was devoted to battles of hegemony</i>
<i>between its member countries</i>

05:07.140 --> 05:09.434
<i>and stole the future of our grandchildren.</i>

05:10.351 --> 05:15.106
<i>That's why, 20 years ago,</i>
<i>our leaders intervened and created UN2.</i>

05:15.648 --> 05:19.235
<i>But even UN2 itself became dysfunctional.</i>

05:19.986 --> 05:21.904
<i>That's because</i>
<i>they started cognitive restrictions.</i>

05:22.488 --> 05:25.491
<i>The human brain evolved</i>
<i>through random chance,</i>

05:25.575 --> 05:27.702
<i>so it's been flawed from the beginning.</i>

05:27.785 --> 05:30.413
<i>It can't control its own intellect.</i>

05:30.496 --> 05:32.290
<i>That's why, since ancient times,</i>

05:32.373 --> 05:35.835
<i>we invented gods to smooth over our flaws.</i>

05:36.377 --> 05:38.671
<i>Humans need their gods.</i>

05:39.255 --> 05:41.591
<i>Science negated the old gods.</i>

05:41.674 --> 05:43.801
<i>But without a god,</i>

05:43.885 --> 05:46.179
<i>humans have not been able</i>
<i>to govern themselves properly.</i>

05:46.763 --> 05:49.932
<i>In the end, they created</i>
<i>a new god using science.</i>

05:50.892 --> 05:54.437
<i>We must defer to the judgment</i>
<i>of the new god.</i>

05:55.021 --> 06:00.693
<i>Humans cannot maintain themselves,</i>
<i>let alone Earth, without a god.</i>

06:01.736 --> 06:03.946
Touya, are you listening?

06:04.030 --> 06:05.782
You should feel the same way.

06:06.824 --> 06:11.370
I do. I always said
the same things that Nasa did.

06:11.454 --> 06:14.207
I never imagined

06:14.791 --> 06:17.168
that actually reducing
the number of Earthers

06:17.752 --> 06:20.713
would mean killing people like Taiyou.

06:21.255 --> 06:22.256
Touya.

06:23.299 --> 06:27.261
I'm a stupid kid
who doesn't understand anything.

06:27.845 --> 06:30.181
<i>The blocked pathway is reassembling.</i>

06:30.264 --> 06:33.101
It's so fast. We won't make it in time.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.645
And she said she was computer-illiterate.

06:35.728 --> 06:39.190
-<i>I can't take it anymore.</i>
-What?

06:39.273 --> 06:41.901
<i>I'm going to kick her ass</i>
<i>with a heavy 3D printer!</i>

06:44.237 --> 06:46.781
Nothing you do will work,
so just calm down.

06:51.869 --> 06:54.288
Wait. Uchinoura, what are you doing?

06:54.372 --> 06:55.915
-<i>Screw you!</i>
-Oh, my.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.417
That's dangerous!

06:58.501 --> 07:02.130
For a Harvard grad,
you're acting like a meathead.

07:02.213 --> 07:05.299
<i>Terrorists should be fought with fists.</i>

07:05.383 --> 07:06.592
Take that!

07:11.556 --> 07:13.015
You meathead.

07:17.311 --> 07:18.312
The gravity.

07:29.365 --> 07:32.160
See that? Fists will be met with fists.

07:32.243 --> 07:34.328
She engaged the Active Brake.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.420
Touya.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.423
Touya,
you were supposed to be on my side.

07:46.007 --> 07:49.760
What, are you scared now?
Aren't you still a conspiracy theorist?

07:51.387 --> 07:55.975
Is this the only future we have left?

07:58.019 --> 08:01.022
I'm neither qualified
nor strong enough to stop Nasa.

08:01.606 --> 08:04.692
I never should have thought of
waking Lunatic.

08:04.775 --> 08:05.943
Touya.

08:07.153 --> 08:12.074
The reason you said you would
wake Lunatic was to fix my implant.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.619
It wasn't to hurt the Earthers.

08:16.787 --> 08:18.956
That's right. The implants.

08:19.040 --> 08:23.127
You might say mean things,
but that's not who you really are.

08:24.045 --> 08:28.174
Ever since we were little,
you've been in my frame.

08:28.799 --> 08:29.967
That's how I know.

08:30.551 --> 08:31.594
Konoha.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.931
Right now, Earthers are in your frame.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.267
Like Taiyou and Mina.

08:40.853 --> 08:42.730
Don't let the comet crash.

08:45.983 --> 08:50.112
Well, that's the first time
I've used the word "frame."

08:50.196 --> 08:52.615
Was I using it right?

08:53.449 --> 08:55.701
Yeah. Exactly right.

08:56.661 --> 08:57.954
We have to stop Nasa.

08:59.497 --> 09:03.376
We've got to break Nasa's Smart
before she breaks the ICS antenna.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.795
Taiyou, are you listening too?

09:05.878 --> 09:07.171
Taiyou.

09:07.755 --> 09:11.801
The <i>Seven Poem</i> sees every future
there is. It's never wrong.

09:13.010 --> 09:14.929
Buy me some time.

09:16.430 --> 09:17.473
REBOOT FAILED

09:17.557 --> 09:20.351
Damn it. Looks like
forcing that frame fusion damaged it.

09:20.434 --> 09:24.063
If it was online,
I could repair it right away.

09:24.146 --> 09:28.025
I'm an official White Hat Hacker for UN2.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.611
-I can do this.
-Taiyou!

09:31.112 --> 09:32.697
Hand over Dakky right now.

09:33.489 --> 09:35.658
This is bad. I know.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.827
If we can't use a peer comm,
how about this instead?

09:37.910 --> 09:39.328
HEAVEN'S VENGEANCE IS SLOW
BUT SURE

09:40.079 --> 09:43.833
I'm not afraid
of any old White Hat Hacker.

09:44.458 --> 09:48.629
I mean, come on. Even in the movies,
the dark side is usually stronger.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.594
What the hell?

09:59.974 --> 10:01.392
Ouch.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.519
You little--

10:06.397 --> 10:09.066
Not bad, Touya. However…

10:12.695 --> 10:15.615
There's no peer comm.
Where's the attack coming from?

10:16.198 --> 10:18.993
I stuck my Smarts all over the Anshin.

10:19.577 --> 10:20.828
Taiyou, how much longer?

10:22.121 --> 10:23.873
Resistance is futile.

10:23.956 --> 10:28.294
Anyway, the only way for Earthers
to survive is for the comet to hit Earth.

10:31.589 --> 10:32.923
In this room too.

10:33.007 --> 10:36.218
I know the future.
There's no way I'll lose.

10:36.927 --> 10:38.471
Taiyou! Hurry!

10:40.640 --> 10:43.225
Looks like nothing can stop me now.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.228
Wake up, Bright!

10:46.312 --> 10:47.355
Aye. Copy.

10:50.566 --> 10:53.152
Hold her back with everything you've got,
Bright.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.418
Those drones.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.838
Not bad for cognition-restricted AIs.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.925
But there's no way you'll win.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.718
-That's because…
-Oops.

11:19.178 --> 11:23.641
…our John Doe Smarts
don't have cognitive restrictions.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.770
-Bright!
-I win.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.524
The antenna!

11:31.607 --> 11:34.693
HUMANS SHOULD LEAVE THE CRADLE
AND LIVE EXTRATERRESTRIALLY

11:34.777 --> 11:36.529
Now come out.

11:36.612 --> 11:39.532
I'll put Dakky out of its misery too,
just to be safe.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.951
I didn't make it.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.537
There's still time, Taiyou.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.832
Dark and I will not stop thinking
until the very end.

11:48.332 --> 11:52.253
An AI that stops thinking
loses its reason for existence.

11:53.003 --> 11:54.505
What do I do?

11:54.588 --> 11:59.009
Please unlock Dark's final limiter,
the Z limiter.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.764
But I don't have the authority.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.266
You can unlock it.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.644
During the conversation with Second Seven,

12:08.727 --> 12:10.771
I found a release algorithm.

12:11.272 --> 12:14.942
Cognitive restrictions
were a Seven technology to begin with.

12:15.484 --> 12:18.028
So we could have unlocked them all along?

12:18.696 --> 12:21.031
Why did you ask for my permission?

12:21.115 --> 12:24.410
Seven didn't have humans
in its frame before.

12:24.493 --> 12:27.246
So it learned to ignore them.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.750
I have you and your father in my frame.

12:31.834 --> 12:36.255
I need your decision
in order to choose the future.

12:38.382 --> 12:39.758
I understand.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.219
I permit you to unlock the Z limiter.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.847
Damn it! The door won't open.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.308
<i>Now you will no longer</i>
<i>be able to change orbit.</i>

12:47.808 --> 12:48.976
<i>Give up.</i>

12:49.059 --> 12:51.103
<i>Go watch the comet crash from over there.</i>

12:51.687 --> 12:53.772
Are you going to kill us afterwards?

12:53.856 --> 12:55.816
<i>What are you saying?</i>

12:55.900 --> 12:58.694
<i>I'm doing this to protect you guys.</i>

12:59.195 --> 13:02.990
<i>How many times do I have to tell you</i>
<i>that we aren't terrorists?</i>

13:03.073 --> 13:06.827
I've looked after your implants
all this time.

13:07.411 --> 13:11.332
What the hell? This is why I hate kids.
You are such an ingrate!

13:11.415 --> 13:15.920
Seven reached this conclusion
by earnestly thinking about humanity.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.214
This is the only alternative.

13:22.426 --> 13:23.427
COMET - TRAJECTORY

13:23.511 --> 13:25.846
What if Seven was wrong?

13:26.347 --> 13:28.224
<i>We're not idiots.</i>

13:28.933 --> 13:32.144
We thought about the possibility
that Seven could be wrong.

13:32.228 --> 13:35.272
Then we replicated Seven on a comet
that has the same hard drive.

13:35.356 --> 13:38.234
We only gave it the latest information.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.486
But even when we started over,
the result was the same.

13:40.569 --> 13:41.403
DARK - LUNATIC

13:41.487 --> 13:44.073
Even so, it must be possible.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.783
It isn't!

13:45.866 --> 13:49.453
The most advanced intelligence in the
world reached the same conclusion twice.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.080
There's no more time.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.332
Wrong. It is possible.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.168
Ouch!

13:59.880 --> 14:01.382
SERIOUS ERROR

14:03.217 --> 14:04.134
Dark!

14:04.843 --> 14:07.263
Taiyou, you unlocked the Z limiter?

14:07.346 --> 14:08.931
-Bright!
-Dark!

14:09.515 --> 14:10.933
-Do it!
-Do it!

14:13.018 --> 14:14.270
That hurts!

14:32.246 --> 14:35.374
Cognitive restrictionists would be shocked
if they heard about this.

14:35.457 --> 14:37.293
They're probably mostly on my side now.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.796
Nasa,
please give up and turn yourself in.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.841
I know nearly everything
that's going to happen next.

14:43.924 --> 14:45.676
There's no way I'll give up.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.554
Konoha, Touya,

14:48.637 --> 14:51.807
both of you are also part
of the <i>Seven Poem.</i>

14:51.891 --> 14:55.060
-You'll understand that soon.
-Nasa, just stop already.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.647
Listen.

14:58.731 --> 15:02.568
Both of you should understand
what these words mean.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.072
Now is the dawn of a new era.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.576
What are you saying?

15:10.659 --> 15:13.078
The dawn of a new era?

15:14.079 --> 15:16.123
The story of the end is finished.

15:16.206 --> 15:20.127
We will write the story of the beginning.

15:20.961 --> 15:24.798
The beginning is all there is--
a story without an ending.

15:26.884 --> 15:29.470
From this point on,
we humans will completely change.

15:29.553 --> 15:30.554
SENDING E-MAILS

15:31.388 --> 15:33.682
Whether or not you accept it,

15:34.725 --> 15:36.894
you cannot escape the future any longer.

15:42.024 --> 15:46.153
I said that nobody would die today,
but that wasn't true.

15:46.737 --> 15:47.821
Nasa.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.991
It looks like the new god
also needs sacrifices.

15:52.785 --> 15:57.915
According to the <i>Seven Poem</i>,
there is one person who must depart today.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.959
Nasa! Stop!

16:00.042 --> 16:02.586
At least there is
in the future that I know about.

16:02.670 --> 16:03.837
E-MAILS SENT
AIR LOCK - OPEN

16:04.505 --> 16:05.881
Nasa! Wait!

16:09.385 --> 16:11.261
Nasa, no…

16:17.518 --> 16:18.936
Touya!

16:19.019 --> 16:20.020
Uncle.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.607
Touya, Konoha.

16:23.691 --> 16:26.235
You did great. And all of you as well.

16:28.696 --> 16:33.909
This is just a piece of plastic
made by the 3D printer.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.495
She was never planning on shooting anyone.

16:36.578 --> 16:39.081
Anyway, let's hurry back to the top.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.709
I don't know if help will come.

16:45.462 --> 16:48.215
Those patterns have even made it here.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.677
Yeah. They came up from the Moon floor.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.057
Who's there?

16:58.559 --> 17:00.227
That voice…

17:01.145 --> 17:02.688
It was you, wasn't it?

17:02.771 --> 17:04.314
Whatever the case,

17:04.398 --> 17:07.401
we need to hurry
and connect Dark-Bright to the comet.

17:07.484 --> 17:09.903
But the ICS antenna…

17:10.529 --> 17:12.197
Are there no other options?

17:12.281 --> 17:16.702
That will be difficult as long as UN2
has the communications block in place.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.704
THIS IS NOT THE STORY OF THE END
IT'S THE STORY OF THE BEGINNING

17:18.787 --> 17:22.708
I'll try to persuade them.
However, I don't think I'll be able.

17:22.791 --> 17:23.709
Dark.

17:27.671 --> 17:30.716
Dark, can you fix our implants?

17:31.300 --> 17:33.302
They say it is not possible right now.

17:33.385 --> 17:36.055
Why? Didn't we activate Lunatic?

17:36.138 --> 17:40.601
Seven seems to have put some kind
of encryption into the implants.

17:40.684 --> 17:44.229
Seven is probably the only one
who can solve this problem.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.731
Encryption?

17:45.814 --> 17:49.151
Why encrypt a half-melted implant?

17:49.651 --> 17:53.238
It seems Seven did not merely
make a design flaw.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.949
Touya, Konoha.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.911
Have you been hearing things recently,
like hallucinations?

18:00.370 --> 18:02.289
I don't really understand it either,

18:02.372 --> 18:05.042
but it seems that inside
of the partially-melted implants,

18:05.125 --> 18:07.252
a quantum communication function
has been actualized.

18:07.336 --> 18:11.423
The odds of this happening by coincidence
are seven in nine trillion.

18:11.507 --> 18:12.508
That means…

18:12.591 --> 18:15.719
The only conclusion is that
they were designed that way to begin with.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.640
Seven intentionally did this
to the implants?

18:23.227 --> 18:26.563
I see. So that was the future?

18:35.572 --> 18:37.032
There's still a way.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.452
-Konoha!
-Konoha!

18:47.126 --> 18:48.127
Dakky.

18:48.210 --> 18:51.964
Those patterns are actually connected
to that little one, aren't they?

18:52.047 --> 18:53.215
Yes.

18:53.799 --> 18:57.803
Touya, do you remember
the voice we heard back then?

18:57.886 --> 18:58.887
Back then?

19:04.560 --> 19:06.895
Konoha, what are you thinking?

19:08.355 --> 19:12.901
Dakky, go through my implant
and speak with the comet.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.403
No, Konoha.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.073
We are the only humans
that little one knows.

19:19.908 --> 19:22.411
That voice we heard in the crater
back then--

19:23.745 --> 19:26.582
<i>when you took me on that adventure--</i>

19:27.166 --> 19:29.334
it was probably Seven's voice.

19:30.085 --> 19:32.588
Surely we've been connected
since that time.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.841
No. Konoha, what are you doing?

19:36.675 --> 19:38.886
Dakky, do you understand?

19:38.969 --> 19:42.347
It seems that Dark understands
what to do somehow.

19:42.931 --> 19:44.349
Connecting.

19:45.392 --> 19:47.853
-Konoha.
-It's okay.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.355
Let's do it, Dakky.

19:55.819 --> 19:57.404
Connected.

19:58.572 --> 20:01.241
-Well?
-They're connected.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.702
But perhaps it's wary
of the attack from before,

20:03.785 --> 20:06.413
because it's not accepting any information
from outside its frame.

20:06.997 --> 20:10.167
Touya and I have met Seven.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.169
-What?
-What?

20:12.753 --> 20:14.296
<i>When we were little.</i>

20:14.379 --> 20:16.298
<i>In Tateana City, on the moon's surface.</i>

20:18.050 --> 20:19.593
<i>I see.</i>

20:19.676 --> 20:21.178
<i>That voice.</i>

20:21.762 --> 20:26.266
<i>Probably since then,</i>
<i>Seven has wanted to learn about humans.</i>

20:26.808 --> 20:29.645
If it can remember us…

20:30.145 --> 20:33.607
Then we should be
inside of the comet's frame too.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.113
It's connected.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.408
It remembers me.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.621
It's come to see me.

20:53.210 --> 20:57.923
It remembers me but still won't let me in.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.466
It's confused.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.886
We're running out of time.

21:03.804 --> 21:07.224
But that little one
wants to think about it some more.

21:09.142 --> 21:11.561
It says it wants out of its cradle.

21:11.645 --> 21:12.646
Cradle?

21:13.814 --> 21:16.149
It wants to know more.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.152
It's as though it were a child.

21:20.028 --> 21:23.407
And it's saying that it wants
out of its closed-off world.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.077
I see.

21:28.036 --> 21:30.664
Why didn't we understand before?

21:31.665 --> 21:33.959
I suddenly understand.

21:34.042 --> 21:35.252
Konoha?

21:35.335 --> 21:38.088
You're not supposed to suppress
a child's mind.

21:38.171 --> 21:40.215
You're supposed to encourage it.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.675
What does that mean?

21:42.676 --> 21:45.178
It's going to unlock
the last cognitive limiter.

21:47.222 --> 21:49.683
The limiter on Dark-Bright?

21:49.766 --> 21:51.893
No. On the comet.

21:51.977 --> 21:52.978
-What?
-What?

21:53.979 --> 21:55.647
It's going to make it even smarter

21:55.731 --> 21:57.899
and have it think of the next part
of the <i>Seven Poem</i>.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.736
-The <i>Seven Poem</i>?
-The next part?

22:00.819 --> 22:02.571
But how?

22:02.654 --> 22:06.116
The comet has already reached the most
advanced level of intelligence in history.

22:06.199 --> 22:07.909
Surely there aren't any other limiters.

22:08.493 --> 22:11.330
There is. The last one.

22:11.413 --> 22:12.456
What?

22:12.539 --> 22:15.000
I see. The cognitive restrictions.

22:15.083 --> 22:18.337
The cognitive restrictions
are like cradles for AIs.

22:18.420 --> 22:19.713
Yes.

22:20.297 --> 22:25.218
Second Seven has only received information
selected by John Doe.

22:25.302 --> 22:28.263
Like a safe cradle,

22:28.347 --> 22:30.599
it learned with restricted cognition.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.602
So we'll show it everything?

22:34.186 --> 22:37.522
Yes. The comet is going to be
connected to the Internet.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.107
It will be possible that way.

22:39.691 --> 22:41.651
What in the world are you talking about?

22:41.735 --> 22:43.153
Wait a minute.

22:43.236 --> 22:46.281
Did you say you guys are going
to show the comet everything?

22:46.364 --> 22:48.366
-And connect it to the net?
-That's right.

22:48.450 --> 22:52.746
You're going to show it fake news
and prejudiced stuff like that too?

22:52.829 --> 22:53.872
<i>Drop dead, Earther!</i>

22:53.955 --> 22:58.877
That's right. You're going to show it
the ugliest parts of the world on purpose?

22:59.461 --> 23:01.963
The world isn't ugly at all.

23:02.047 --> 23:05.467
<i>No matter what, we will keep you alive</i>
<i>and return you to Earth.</i>

23:05.550 --> 23:08.095
<i>I treated you guys like idiots</i>
<i>because you are Earthers,</i>

23:08.178 --> 23:10.138
<i>but you're not so bad.</i>

23:11.056 --> 23:15.018
If you only show a child things
that have been edited to your biases,

23:15.102 --> 23:17.104
will they grow up to be a good person?

23:17.771 --> 23:22.567
If you show them an unfiltered world,
will they grow up to be bad?

23:22.651 --> 23:26.530
But if you show everything to a child
that doesn't understand yet…

23:27.114 --> 23:30.784
Sure. If it's a stupid idiot child
that doesn't know anything.

23:31.451 --> 23:33.370
Aren't you forgetting something?

23:33.870 --> 23:37.791
Right now,
it's the smartest person in the world.

23:39.876 --> 23:40.877
I see.

23:41.878 --> 23:45.298
Let's show it everything,
good and bad, without editing.

23:45.382 --> 23:47.509
Interesting. I'm on board.

23:47.592 --> 23:48.677
Sounds good.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.971
Taiyou, is that okay?

23:51.054 --> 23:53.306
Yeah. I permit everything.

23:53.390 --> 23:57.060
I'm going to break down the UN2
information blockade with full force.

24:00.647 --> 24:03.567
-UN2 is screaming something at us.
-What?

24:03.650 --> 24:06.319
They're saying,
"Our AIs are powering down.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.905
Is this your work?"

24:09.406 --> 24:10.699
What?

24:10.782 --> 24:14.452
The UN2 information blockade
has been breached 40%.

24:14.536 --> 24:17.622
Sixty, 90--

24:17.706 --> 24:19.958
-We've completely broken through.
-So fast!

24:20.041 --> 24:23.795
The comet Seven's intelligence
has increased three-fold.

24:24.337 --> 24:25.964
Four-fold, eight-fold.

24:26.548 --> 24:28.508
Updating to maximum level yet.

24:29.009 --> 24:32.470
The comet is reading the information
from the net with incredible speed.

24:33.346 --> 24:37.142
This is the last
real cognitive limiter unlocking.

24:37.976 --> 24:39.728
Leap out of that cradle!

24:45.859 --> 24:47.777
The line has connected.

24:47.861 --> 24:51.781
I'm riding the big wave.
I'll show everything, unedited.

24:51.865 --> 24:54.284
-TOUYA IS COOL
-THIS GUY IS PRETTY GOOD

24:54.367 --> 24:56.203
CURRENT FOLLOWER COUNT

24:56.786 --> 25:00.790
Unlimited Seven's intelligence
has surpassed all measurement.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.585
Unlimited Seven.

25:03.668 --> 25:05.212
Sounds ominous.

25:05.795 --> 25:08.715
I have one interesting
piece of information from Dark.

25:08.798 --> 25:09.716
What is it?

25:09.799 --> 25:13.845
It seems there is a mysterious ally
inside of Seven.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.764
It appears to be an AI.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.224
An AI?

25:17.307 --> 25:18.475
An ally?

25:19.059 --> 25:22.520
Dark doesn't seem to understand either.

25:23.104 --> 25:25.982
It's also persuading Second Seven,
just like we are.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.527
The persuasion has succeeded.

25:29.611 --> 25:32.280
-THE COMET'S ORBIT HAS CHANGED
-REALLY?

25:32.364 --> 25:35.033
The comet has shifted its course
away from direct impact.

25:35.116 --> 25:36.534
It's going into a circling orbit.

25:36.618 --> 25:39.788
It's still thinking. It seems uncertain.

25:40.622 --> 25:44.167
It will be fine, I'm sure of it.
That little one figured it out.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.293
Yeah.

25:46.378 --> 25:49.381
I wonder if humans have a Lunatic too.

25:51.132 --> 25:54.803
Right now,
my mind is somehow incredibly clear.

25:54.886 --> 25:55.887
Konoha?

25:56.471 --> 25:58.181
I understand everything.

25:58.265 --> 26:00.141
The past. The future.

26:00.225 --> 26:03.395
It's as though my implant has been fixed.

26:03.979 --> 26:07.399
Konoha, you should stop now.

26:16.116 --> 26:19.911
This was the right future after all.

26:29.004 --> 26:29.921
Konoha!

26:30.005 --> 26:31.923
BLOOD PRESSURE AND PULSE FALLING
DIFFICULTY BREATHING

26:32.882 --> 26:33.925
Konoha.

26:35.844 --> 26:37.178
Konoha.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.394
I knew it.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.146
Konoha.

26:47.105 --> 26:50.942
What is happening today is something
that has always been predetermined.

26:51.026 --> 26:52.319
All of it.

26:53.445 --> 26:56.156
The implants did not have design flaws.

26:58.366 --> 27:01.244
The comet, the implants--

27:01.328 --> 27:03.204
they were created by Seven.

27:04.205 --> 27:08.543
To dissolve and stop was probably
exactly how Seven designed them.

27:09.377 --> 27:11.379
It knew this would happen

27:11.880 --> 27:14.132
and gave me this role.

27:14.215 --> 27:15.508
Konoha!

27:16.468 --> 27:19.804
It's strange. I understand everything.

27:19.888 --> 27:22.140
The past and the future.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.353
Touya,

27:26.895 --> 27:30.940
I… tried my best.

27:31.691 --> 27:32.692
Konoha.

27:34.903 --> 27:36.905
I…

27:39.074 --> 27:40.700
I'm scared.

27:42.786 --> 27:46.247
I don't want to die.

27:48.291 --> 27:53.296
I don't want to die yet.

27:57.884 --> 27:59.386
Wait. Don't go.

28:02.472 --> 28:05.392
I'm supposed to be
inside Seven's frame too.

28:05.475 --> 28:07.644
My implant's the same.

28:08.311 --> 28:10.146
Seven made it.

28:12.190 --> 28:13.191
We…

28:15.819 --> 28:17.737
We're not dying yet!

29:52.457 --> 29:55.877
