00:28.654 --> 00:30.656
I should have let that bitch burn.

00:32.406 --> 00:33.575
You were right.

00:34.326 --> 00:39.081
Hey. You're bulletproof, not clairvoyant.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.336
Danny and I went to Harlem's Paradise.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.507
We should've ended it there.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.636
Should've went upstairs
and snapped her neck.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.263
That is not you.

00:55.264 --> 00:56.473
Right now...

00:57.891 --> 00:59.226
the way I feel...

01:01.061 --> 01:02.813
could be.

01:09.736 --> 01:12.364
The brass band's
about to pull up any minute.

01:13.699 --> 01:17.286
Misty, you can stay. Luke's gotta go.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.376
Now's not the time.

01:30.382 --> 01:32.843
You really think Mariah Dillard's
responsible for this?

01:32.926 --> 01:35.345
I know it in my bones.

01:36.555 --> 01:41.476
This... whole thing is just a smoke out.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.854
To force Bushmaster to respond.

01:44.896 --> 01:48.191
Rude boy culture definitely demands
a response. No doubt.

01:50.152 --> 01:52.613
- We ready to end Mariah or what?
- Slow your roll.

01:53.196 --> 01:56.575
You can't discount the Italians,
the Puerto Ricans, the Korean mobs.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.076
Any of them could have done this.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.161
Come on, man. Never!

01:59.786 --> 02:03.206
Hey, Tomas, these are all
9mm casings, right?

02:04.541 --> 02:07.878
Well, it looks like it, yeah.
But it's too early to tell.

02:07.961 --> 02:13.091
This looks like a close-contact wound.

02:14.801 --> 02:18.430
And there are no shell casings
near this body.

02:18.513 --> 02:20.766
It's maybe a revolver.

02:23.435 --> 02:25.062
Misty...

02:25.145 --> 02:26.980
see this blood trail?

02:33.820 --> 02:35.572
It's going in the wrong direction.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.617
Somebody survived.

02:38.700 --> 02:42.204
If anybody finds a living witness...

02:42.287 --> 02:44.122
They won't survive much longer.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.163
What are you doing?
The nightshade we have.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.998
It's not enough.

04:08.081 --> 04:12.502
We need the real thing.
Not this GMO crap you guys manufactured.

04:16.714 --> 04:20.177
You're a survivor, bredren.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.597
Fight.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.094
Stop it, Corny!

05:03.178 --> 05:06.306
You got my hair wet. Cornell!

05:06.389 --> 05:08.058
May May, get in the pool!

05:12.729 --> 05:14.022
Johnny!

05:15.524 --> 05:16.775
Johnny!

05:16.858 --> 05:19.361
Go talk to the bell captain
and get more bags.

05:19.444 --> 05:22.572
It's a holiday, you know?
You still have work.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.037
Auntie Ingrid, where's Mommy?

05:31.748 --> 05:32.791
Go!

05:46.763 --> 05:50.141
You can't ignore me.
It's my turn to speak.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.477
You ask me,
you already said too damn much.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.521
Come on, Maybelline, Gwen's reasonable.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.273
Let's settle this shit.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.149
Nobody asked her to stay away.

05:58.233 --> 06:02.028
Did that on my own,
after what you did to Quincy.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.280
You kidding me?

06:03.363 --> 06:05.156
He shot Buggy!

06:05.240 --> 06:08.201
Show some respect,
you murdering, stealing bitch.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.370
- Sit down, please.
- You wanna sit down now.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.871
- Settle down.
- Where's my money?

06:11.955 --> 06:14.207
Settle, settle, settle.
Please be reasonable.

06:14.833 --> 06:17.002
Both men are dead. It was a tragedy.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.170
All Ms. McIver is asking for

06:19.254 --> 06:21.131
is her fair share
of her late husband's estate.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.383
My clients owe him nothing. Or her.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.303
Mr. Donovan, Mrs. Stokes,

06:27.178 --> 06:32.225
this piece of paper is an agreement...
both men signed

06:32.309 --> 06:36.855
acknowledging a 50% split on everything,
from the rum company to the club.

06:36.938 --> 06:40.692
You gonna base this shit
on a goddamn cocktail napkin?

06:40.775 --> 06:45.030
Pete played guitar at Smalls Paradise
the night they signed it.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.743
You were there too, Maybelline.

06:51.036 --> 06:54.122
You remember all the good times we shared.

06:54.205 --> 06:58.543
The plans beyond the rum label?
The resort?

07:00.337 --> 07:03.882
Buggy always liked it down here. Not me.

07:04.883 --> 07:07.510
Too many goddamn mosquitoes.

07:09.888 --> 07:12.849
Always reminded me of the fields.

07:13.808 --> 07:16.144
We both know my client
would win in open court.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.270
That's bullshit.

07:17.354 --> 07:20.315
- What do you propose, Counselor?
- Open your books in court.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.692
That's not gonna happen.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.362
Or we can settle this moment
privately.

07:27.739 --> 07:29.658
What you thinkin'?

07:30.533 --> 07:33.370
Half of Quincy's shares
of the sold Bushmaster

07:33.453 --> 07:36.623
and continuing profits
of Harlem's Paradise.

07:42.379 --> 07:45.048
Don't... don't... don't start.

07:46.424 --> 07:47.467
Your ass...

07:54.599 --> 07:55.850
Get me something to drink.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.354
Before I tell somebody.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.106
If she thinks we'll open our books,

08:01.189 --> 08:04.901
she must be smoking that shit
they tried to sell me at the airport.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.248
Place your hand on the touch pad.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.629
Hey!

08:24.713 --> 08:27.090
This is biometric black James Bond shit.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.925
Little gift from Atreus Plastics.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.260
I love it.

08:38.143 --> 08:41.813
I was thinking we could hang the Basquiat
on this wall, Madam.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.149
Oh, yes!

08:44.232 --> 08:47.277
The Afzelia wood veneer
will offset it beautifully.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.029
Brilliant, boy.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.365
And underneath all of this, Atreus resin.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.617
It's three feet thick.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.953
They developed it with the intention
of building a bunker

08:57.037 --> 09:00.206
that could withstand nuclear attack.

09:02.083 --> 09:05.170
You think that this plastic bullshit

09:05.253 --> 09:08.173
is gonna prevent that man
from coming to get you

09:08.256 --> 09:09.799
after what you did last night?

09:11.342 --> 09:12.635
What we did.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.764
When the time is right,

09:15.847 --> 09:20.435
we will pop him in his bumbaclaat ass
once and for all.

09:22.187 --> 09:25.148
We're building this safe room
for a reason, Hernan.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.359
Bushmaster's coming.

09:28.443 --> 09:31.446
And when he does, we'll be ready.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.325
Please don't do this.

09:56.554 --> 09:59.432
I'm gonna haunt you
for the rest of your days.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.936
You're gonna eat, but you won't taste.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.689
You're gonna sleep, but you won't rest.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.526
Everything you love,
you're gonna lose. You hear me?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.611
You hear me?!

10:23.873 --> 10:26.501
<i>Come on, who are you?</i>

10:26.584 --> 10:29.504
<i>- Is it you, Mariah?
- Misty. Misty.</i>

10:30.964 --> 10:31.965
Luke.

10:32.966 --> 10:33.842
What are you thinking?

10:33.925 --> 10:36.511
I'm thinking,
"You ruined my concentration."

10:37.220 --> 10:39.013
- Misty.
- Yeah?

10:39.097 --> 10:42.350
Name's Stephanie Miller.
Junior at Columbia. Jamaican parents.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.644
That's her baby sister
that she was killed with.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.313
- She wasn't even 15.
- Jesus.

10:48.231 --> 10:50.441
Paul Mackintosh aka Anansi.

10:50.525 --> 10:52.068
He served some time in Jamaica,

10:52.152 --> 10:54.320
but he's been on the straight and narrow
for 20 years.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.281
He owned Gwen's.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.868
Hmm. It says here that Gwen's
was named in honor

10:59.951 --> 11:02.704
of co-owner Ingrid Mackintosh's sister,

11:03.329 --> 11:04.747
Gwen McIver.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.000
That's him. That's Bushmaster.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.626
Was Ingrid among the dead?

11:09.335 --> 11:13.256
No. She checked in on her work card,
but she wasn't ID'd with the other bodies.

11:13.339 --> 11:16.342
She's our witness. Gotta be. I'm on it.

11:17.719 --> 11:18.720
Hey.

11:18.803 --> 11:19.804
Wait.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.932
We gotta consider what Tomas said.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.560
You think any of the other crime families
could have done this?

11:25.643 --> 11:29.939
We need answers either way.
I can shake the trees easier than you can.

11:30.732 --> 11:33.067
I gotta try and stop this shit
before it gets any worse.

11:34.193 --> 11:37.238
Just don't mess up my case, please.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.782
And don't get caught.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.451
Wasn't planning on it.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.124
I've got a few quick questions for ya.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.504
Tell me about the killings at Gwen's.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.342
No, no, no. Wait, it wasn't us.
I swear to God. It wasn't us.

11:57.425 --> 12:01.012
Ask around about me.
If you're lying, it's on.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.681
Understand?

12:12.857 --> 12:13.858
Espresso?

12:16.569 --> 12:18.571
Hey, Misty. I'm in Queens.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.782
Just finished hollering at the Italians,

12:20.865 --> 12:23.034
none of the other families
had anything to do with this.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.452
It's gotta be Mariah.

12:24.535 --> 12:25.745
<i>Check your text.</i>

12:34.754 --> 12:35.922
Is that who I think it is?

12:36.005 --> 12:40.009
<i>It's surveillance video of Ingrid
around the corner from Gwen's last night.</i>

12:40.093 --> 12:44.889
<i>Look, I appreciate your help, Luke, I do,
but I asked you not to mess up my case.</i>

12:44.973 --> 12:47.725
I don't want Mariah
slipping through any loopholes.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.394
I want her dead to rights.

12:49.477 --> 12:50.603
Yeah, I just want her dead.

12:50.687 --> 12:53.356
<i>This is an open phone, Luke.</i>

12:53.439 --> 12:55.900
Look, I'm gonna call Tomas.

12:55.984 --> 12:59.862
He will scramble hospitals in Brooklyn,
and I will do the same up here.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.907
That's gonna take too long.
She's either gonna look for her nephew

13:02.991 --> 13:05.201
or she's gonna try to slip
through the cracks.

13:05.284 --> 13:08.371
Tell you what. I'll look for her
in Crown Heights myself, all right?

13:08.997 --> 13:11.708
The West Indian Day Parade is today.
You won't be able to find her.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.167
Hello?

13:13.251 --> 13:15.044
He did not just hang up on me.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.713
Mercedes, we need to talk.

13:18.631 --> 13:22.176
Press already has a name for it.
"The Rum Punch Massacre."

13:22.260 --> 13:25.722
Karen Page just called for a quote,
asking about a living witness.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.765
What? So we have a leak?

13:27.849 --> 13:30.393
Gwen's was as much a community center
as it was a restaurant.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.603
And people know that the owner,
Paul Mackintosh, died.

13:32.687 --> 13:35.023
They figured his wife
must be out there somewhere.

13:35.106 --> 13:37.734
And the press will not sit on that story.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.653
Well, we need Ingrid alive.

13:40.737 --> 13:43.239
- Look, I've got to go.
- No, no, no. You need to delegate.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.824
Mayor wants us to reassure the public

13:44.907 --> 13:46.951
Brooklyn's tragedy
won't extend to other boroughs.

13:47.035 --> 13:50.038
"Us"? You're deputy chief.

13:50.121 --> 13:52.999
Okay, you can handle this
while I go and find Ingrid.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.877
The commissioner and the mayor
asked for you, specifically.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.170
- Me?
- Yeah.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.048
- Why?
- They want the lead investigator

14:00.131 --> 14:01.758
on the case to calm people's nerves.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.885
And it don't hurt none that you a sister,

14:03.968 --> 14:06.637
given how insular
the West Indian community can be.

14:06.721 --> 14:10.099
Look, I don't have time
to be a poster child.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.601
Well, you need to make some time.

14:11.684 --> 14:15.188
You could be commissioner one day,
and it starts right here.

14:16.773 --> 14:19.567
Detective, there been
any arrests made in this case at all?

14:19.650 --> 14:22.111
I'm Detective Misty Knight
with the 29th precinct.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.738
I'm here to answer your questions.

14:23.821 --> 14:26.866
Is the massacre in Brooklyn connected
to recent Jamaican violence in Harlem?

14:26.949 --> 14:29.660
What about the man who attacked
Luke Cage? Is he involved in this?

14:29.744 --> 14:34.624
<i>As lead investigator on that case,
I can't discuss any details.</i>

14:34.707 --> 14:37.210
But I can assure you
that we are all working very hard

14:37.293 --> 14:39.212
to tamp down the recent rise in violence.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.011
<i>Are there any suspects?</i>

14:47.720 --> 14:50.807
<i>None that I care to alert
by answering that question.</i>

14:50.890 --> 14:52.892
<i>How is Luke Cage
involved in this case?</i>

14:52.975 --> 14:56.187
<i>Luke Cage is not an officer with the NYPD.</i>

14:56.270 --> 14:57.271
Excuse me.

14:57.939 --> 14:59.941
Is this woman a patient here?

15:00.525 --> 15:02.860
No, I don't think so.

15:02.944 --> 15:03.945
Thank you.

15:06.280 --> 15:10.159
If he's not involved, what's to prevent
another massacre from happening in Harlem?

15:10.243 --> 15:11.077
Me.

15:12.578 --> 15:15.540
And every single officer
in this department

15:15.623 --> 15:20.670
who works this sometimes-thankless job
day by day, keeping our city safe.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.380
No matter the personal sacrifice.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.217
You Luke Cage?

15:26.717 --> 15:28.511
The woman you're looking for,
she have papers?

15:28.594 --> 15:31.055
- I don't know.
- Have you tried the <i>clÃ­nicas?</i>

15:31.139 --> 15:32.223
<i>ClÃ­nicas?</i>

15:32.306 --> 15:34.892
They're neighborhood infirmaries.
Cash only.

15:34.976 --> 15:37.770
- That's where she might be, you know.
- Thank you.

15:39.313 --> 15:42.316
<i>New York Bulletin</i> reporter Karen Page
has it from an inside source

15:42.400 --> 15:45.236
that there was a survivor
to the so-called Rum Punch Massacre?

15:45.319 --> 15:47.613
I resent that flippant name.

15:48.239 --> 15:50.283
Look, this is not a sound bite
or a headline.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.951
Innocent people were slaughtered.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.954
And when the time is right,
we will release a full report.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.165
- Thank you.
- Was there a survivor at all?

15:58.124 --> 16:00.543
Was there a survivor or not?

16:01.419 --> 16:04.172
<i>And when the time is right,
we will release a full report.</i>

16:04.255 --> 16:06.299
<i>- Thank you.
- Was there a survivor or not?</i>

16:07.675 --> 16:09.010
We have a survivor.

16:09.719 --> 16:10.761
Who?

16:12.221 --> 16:13.639
Tater tot's wife.

16:17.768 --> 16:20.146
Find that bitch and take her ass out.

16:20.229 --> 16:24.609
If she was lucky enough to survive that,
she ain't saying shit.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.070
I need you to tell me
what you were thinking.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.448
Doing that.

16:31.073 --> 16:34.827
He came at me. I didn't start this.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.874
Alex sent Ricky and Tony to Crown Heights.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.210
They're already combing the neighborhood.

16:42.293 --> 16:43.252
Meet them there.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.589
That goddamn parade is today.
You better find her quick.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.467
Alex?

16:51.844 --> 16:54.680
Alex is a shot caller now?

16:54.764 --> 16:57.016
I don't have time for your insecurity.

16:58.309 --> 17:00.061
I see you, Hernan.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.648
I see the conflict in your eyes.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.693
I smell your fear.

17:07.777 --> 17:10.070
It used to be mine.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.574
We're gonna make big moves, man,
you and I.

17:13.657 --> 17:15.742
Just like we talked about.

17:15.826 --> 17:17.244
But in order for that to happen,

17:17.328 --> 17:21.457
I need you to leave Hernan behind,
just for a while,

17:21.540 --> 17:23.542
and be my Shades.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.337
You think you can
just wash your hands of this?

17:29.382 --> 17:30.591
You think it's that simple?

17:30.675 --> 17:31.884
I do.

17:33.469 --> 17:37.723
I need you to do what Shades always does.

17:37.807 --> 17:42.728
Take care of business
while I secure our true future.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.691
Can you do that for me, darling?

17:47.692 --> 17:48.734
Yes.

17:50.695 --> 17:51.862
Yes, I can.

17:57.535 --> 18:01.872
Bailey, were any .38 slugs
recovered from Anansi's body?

18:01.956 --> 18:03.916
Tomas just slipped me
the ballistics report,

18:04.000 --> 18:07.378
and only 9mm guns were used.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.839
A revolver is an anomaly.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.427
Why are you so interested
in it being a .38?

18:15.511 --> 18:19.599
Candace Miller. She was killed with a .38.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.521
I'm worried his body
can't tolerate much more.

18:28.899 --> 18:31.861
Keep going.
Johnny can take it.

18:33.154 --> 18:35.197
Ya hear me? I said keep going.

18:35.781 --> 18:39.619
Okay. Can you at least give me
his medical history?

18:40.453 --> 18:41.912
How long have you known him?

18:41.996 --> 18:43.331
Since we were both 11.

18:43.414 --> 18:44.999
Has he always used nightshade?

18:46.334 --> 18:49.962
No. But he's always been strong.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.759
<i>When we were younger, they injected kids
with a free vaccination.</i>

19:00.056 --> 19:03.601
My mother didn't trust it, you know?
But a lot of people did.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.770
They gave us money. They gave us food.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.356
Johnny got the injection
with all the other children.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.359
They all died.

19:11.442 --> 19:13.819
But Johnny, he lives.

19:13.903 --> 19:16.364
- What was in the injection?
- I don't know.

19:17.531 --> 19:20.701
But after that, they called him special.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.204
Blessed.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.290
Nightshade doesn't give.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.460
Nightshade reveals.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.882
- It also might be what's killing him.
- Maybe.

19:36.008 --> 19:40.638
But he can't die until he finishes
what he's supposed to do.

19:41.389 --> 19:42.598
Kill my mother?

19:43.849 --> 19:44.975
Why?

19:45.059 --> 19:46.936
All over some Bushmaster rum?

19:48.354 --> 19:51.649
The rum is only the beginning.

19:53.484 --> 19:54.902
Throw it in there!

20:02.076 --> 20:03.661
We got to get out of here.

20:03.744 --> 20:06.163
- Now!
- Mommy, you first.

20:06.247 --> 20:09.625
- You first, Mommy.
- No! You go! Help me up after!

20:09.709 --> 20:11.419
Run, Johnny, run!

20:33.107 --> 20:37.403
No, Mommy. Mommy... Mommy, no.

20:50.708 --> 20:53.002
More wood for the fire.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.347
Sorry, babe.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.855
Told your mom I wasn't dealing
with no goddamn lawyers.

21:16.609 --> 21:17.777
Mama Mabel.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.947
I didn't know everything.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.408
It's horrible what they did to him.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.245
Your family.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.582
Same blood runs in your veins.

21:37.213 --> 21:38.214
Misty.

21:38.923 --> 21:42.218
That slug that we pulled
from Anansi's body came back with a match.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.344
The bullet was fired from...

21:43.427 --> 21:45.846
From the same gun
that was used to kill Candace Miller.

21:45.930 --> 21:46.972
You're right.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.516
But I know what you're thinking.

21:48.599 --> 21:51.727
- There are millions of guns in this city.
- Yeah, not that gun.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.437
Whoever killed Candace may have dumped it,

21:53.521 --> 21:55.147
then it was picked up
by Anansi's killer.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.357
No, look.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.442
It says that the striation marks
are unique,

21:58.526 --> 22:00.903
and they suggest an older model .38.

22:00.986 --> 22:04.031
Something this rare
wouldn't be kicking it around Harlem.

22:04.114 --> 22:05.366
It's a trophy piece.

22:05.449 --> 22:08.744
Something a flamboyant former councilwoman
might be carrying around?

22:08.828 --> 22:09.745
Boom.

22:13.207 --> 22:18.128
You're the gun lady of Harlem.
Why the sudden interest in the dope game?

22:18.212 --> 22:21.799
Guns are great. They maintain the peace.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.384
But heroin...

22:23.467 --> 22:24.969
everybody's on it now.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.346
That's true currency.

22:28.055 --> 22:32.476
I couldn't agree with you more.
But that's our business.

22:33.060 --> 22:35.437
And no one wants to stop that.

22:36.313 --> 22:41.235
If we can come
to a satisfactory agreement,

22:42.236 --> 22:46.240
I'm willing to allow Yangsi Gonshi
to run China White through Harlem.

22:46.824 --> 22:49.660
I heard you're sitting on half a billion.

22:50.869 --> 22:53.539
And no one's called it "China White"
in ages.

22:53.622 --> 22:54.832
You don't need this.

22:55.457 --> 22:58.043
I'm old enough
to remember your grandmother.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.297
It goes against the family credo.

23:02.089 --> 23:05.884
Well, they're all dead,
and I'm running the shit now.

23:05.968 --> 23:08.637
And I am thinking bigger
than they ever did.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.432
It's time, Yang.

23:11.515 --> 23:15.853
It's time for us
to let the ghosts of the past die.

23:15.936 --> 23:19.189
It's time for you and me
to tear down that wall.

23:19.773 --> 23:21.233
Together.

23:26.614 --> 23:27.615
Together?

23:46.258 --> 23:47.259
Hey!

24:06.236 --> 24:10.908
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.
Listen, I was just doing my job.

24:10.991 --> 24:13.118
That's what you were doing at Gwen's?
Your job?

24:13.202 --> 24:14.703
I wasn't there. Swear to God.

24:15.996 --> 24:18.916
You run home. Tell Mariah I'm coming.

24:36.642 --> 24:39.269
Lady, I'm here to protect you!

24:39.353 --> 24:41.980
I know you,
Luke Cage!

24:42.064 --> 24:44.775
You've come to take me hostage
to lure my nephew.

24:45.442 --> 24:48.654
Look in my eyes. I'm not here to hurt you.

24:50.489 --> 24:54.410
Let's get a move on before Mariah's people
come back to finish the job.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.579
Come on. We can lose them in the parade.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.199
- Get in there. Get in there.
- Wait.

25:34.283 --> 25:35.284
- Be quiet.
- Wait.

25:35.367 --> 25:38.037
- Don't move. Don't move.
- Don't hurt me. Please!

25:40.831 --> 25:41.832
You.

25:43.292 --> 25:44.501
I saw you.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.378
Please, please.

25:51.008 --> 25:52.009
- Please.
- Shut up!

25:54.136 --> 25:56.638
- Close your eyes! Close your eyes.
- Oh, my God!

26:00.017 --> 26:01.435
Have mercy.

26:03.270 --> 26:05.147
Mercy...

26:06.565 --> 26:08.400
Please have mercy.

26:10.068 --> 26:12.070
Please don't shoot me.

26:18.327 --> 26:21.371
Please, please don't shoot me.

26:36.553 --> 26:38.722
She'll come for me anywhere.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.642
Like they came for my sister.

26:47.773 --> 26:51.318
Just take me to my husband.
Let me see his body.

26:51.401 --> 26:53.403
No, not yet.
Look, I gotta get you to Harlem.

26:53.487 --> 26:55.739
- Misty can help...
- No Harlem. No cops.

26:55.823 --> 26:57.074
Then what do you want to me do?

26:57.699 --> 27:01.620
I'm so tired of seeing women and kids
caught in the cross fire.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.957
The killing has to stop.

27:05.040 --> 27:09.545
It won't happen till the last
of the Stokes is buried in dirt.

27:11.004 --> 27:14.258
Take her out. You have the power.

27:14.883 --> 27:16.552
She can't stop you.

27:17.594 --> 27:18.762
Just kill her.

27:18.846 --> 27:22.140
Help me do this the right way.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.393
Please.

27:25.269 --> 27:27.104
Tell the police what you saw last night.

27:27.187 --> 27:32.109
You want me to relive
when she shot my husband and burned him?

27:34.069 --> 27:36.989
Do you know what that feels like,
Luke Cage?

27:37.698 --> 27:40.117
To see someone you love suffer?

27:41.034 --> 27:44.204
Ripped away by someone else's hand?

27:47.332 --> 27:50.210
Then you know what it's like
on the other side.

27:51.211 --> 27:55.257
The anger and the rage.
The taste of blood in your mouth.

27:56.049 --> 28:00.846
But more war... isn't the answer to war.

28:02.723 --> 28:05.601
Otherwise, it's just...

28:07.060 --> 28:08.395
It's just chaos.

28:10.689 --> 28:11.690
Come on.

28:17.571 --> 28:19.990
The two of you are a lot alike, you know?

28:20.574 --> 28:21.909
You and my nephew.

28:24.202 --> 28:26.538
He lets his anger go.

28:27.748 --> 28:29.458
You internalize it.

28:30.751 --> 28:33.086
Your way is much more dangerous.

28:35.797 --> 28:38.634
- How far is your place from here?
- I'm close.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.887
We could stop by and get a few things.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.014
But it's a risk.

28:44.848 --> 28:47.351
Either they're watching your place,
or the cops are.

28:47.434 --> 28:48.852
Is there any place else?

28:48.936 --> 28:52.481
I have a friend, Luis.
He has a restaurant.

28:52.564 --> 28:53.982
It'll have to do.

28:55.901 --> 28:56.902
Come on.

29:16.296 --> 29:17.589
I told you.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.967
It's a risk giving more nightshade
right now.

29:20.050 --> 29:22.344
And I told you to take it.

30:22.904 --> 30:24.031
Sheldon!

30:29.911 --> 30:30.954
What you got?

30:31.913 --> 30:35.876
Pineapple, plants and mangoes.
Everything fresh!

30:39.087 --> 30:40.255
Lord have mercy!

30:42.799 --> 30:43.800
Who's that?

30:44.343 --> 30:45.761
Sorry, coconut.

30:47.137 --> 30:51.141
When you get to hell,
tell Quincy that was for Buggy.

30:53.143 --> 30:54.144
No, no, no.

30:54.227 --> 30:56.897
- Stay with me.
- Anansi, don't let him die.

30:56.980 --> 30:58.607
Not Gwen's boy.

30:58.690 --> 31:02.319
Ingrid, he's not gonna die. Not today.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.767
You're sure this science thing
is gonna work?

31:33.850 --> 31:35.852
If you don't calm down,
I'm gonna put you out.

31:35.936 --> 31:36.978
Just calm down.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.372
Maddah, you sure you can heal him?

31:56.581 --> 32:00.460
Nightshade no heal. Nightshade reveal.

32:14.641 --> 32:17.727
Breathe if you want to live.
Come, darling.

32:18.311 --> 32:20.730
Breathe. Breathe.

32:29.072 --> 32:32.284
Come, my darling. Good boy. Good boy.

32:37.664 --> 32:40.792
Breathe, my darling. That's my boy.

32:43.044 --> 32:45.255
Good boy. That's it.

32:50.177 --> 32:51.511
Breathe, my darling.

32:55.807 --> 32:56.683
Keep breathing.

33:01.021 --> 33:03.356
You see? You see, he's strong.

33:03.857 --> 33:05.650
You see? He's special!

33:07.235 --> 33:10.405
<i>Johnny was healed
and given new life.</i>

33:10.489 --> 33:12.908
<i>That bushwoman's nightshade
hardened his skin,</i>

33:12.991 --> 33:15.660
<i>but he was special long before that.</i>

33:17.829 --> 33:18.914
<i>Anansi knew it</i>

33:18.997 --> 33:22.792
<i>when he survived the vaccination
that killed all of the other children.</i>

33:24.711 --> 33:27.172
<i>That's why he fought so hard to save him.</i>

33:27.255 --> 33:28.798
Hey, hey, hey.

33:31.051 --> 33:32.844
Welcome back, me Dads.

33:35.722 --> 33:39.017
"Our miracle boy," Anansi would say.

33:41.686 --> 33:43.438
The nightshade saved him.

33:44.272 --> 33:47.734
But he was always indestructible,
just like you.

33:47.817 --> 33:49.444
We're nothing alike.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.112
He protects his people.

33:51.738 --> 33:53.740
Just as you do for Harlem.

33:53.823 --> 33:56.743
I would never put my loved ones in danger.

33:56.826 --> 33:58.787
Or use them as human shields.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.623
Or shoot up churches. Or cut off heads.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.250
Last night was a retaliation.

34:03.333 --> 34:06.253
When he sees evil, he tries to destroy it.

34:06.336 --> 34:07.921
You wouldn't do the same?

34:08.755 --> 34:11.967
You no have to say it.
I see it in your eyes.

34:15.804 --> 34:17.597
Streets are starting to clear.

34:18.264 --> 34:20.058
We can go to Anansi now?

34:20.934 --> 34:22.686
Misty and the police
wanna talk to you first.

34:22.768 --> 34:26.231
No. Just get me to Anansi, Luke Cage.

34:26.313 --> 34:28.190
Please. I beg you.

34:44.623 --> 34:46.418
Jerry, anything?

34:46.501 --> 34:48.210
Striation marks are unique.

34:48.295 --> 34:50.170
Probably some sort of custom-made piece.

34:52.132 --> 34:55.885
<i>Got something.
Unsolved homicide from a few decades back.</i>

34:55.969 --> 34:57.470
<i>Guy dragged out of the river.</i>

34:57.554 --> 34:58.638
Cause of death?

34:58.722 --> 35:02.767
Single gunshot wound to the chest.
Bullet's a match.

35:54.235 --> 35:55.654
Got ya.

36:13.463 --> 36:15.340
I'm still better than you.

36:16.132 --> 36:18.593
You keep telling yourself that, May May.

36:19.928 --> 36:22.138
Drugs are a plague.

36:24.391 --> 36:26.518
I don't have to listen to you.

36:26.601 --> 36:30.230
You forget, you're dead and gone.

36:31.356 --> 36:32.941
I'm right here.

36:34.609 --> 36:37.737
Where I will always be.

36:39.197 --> 36:43.910
And you out here dragging our name
through the goddamn streets.

36:43.993 --> 36:45.954
I legitimized our name.

36:46.037 --> 36:51.292
I built community centers
and real estate projects,

36:51.376 --> 36:55.672
safe spaces for women and kids.

36:56.548 --> 36:57.924
And every time,

36:58.007 --> 37:01.219
something connected to you
came up to taint it.

37:02.137 --> 37:05.849
All of this is your fault.

37:07.976 --> 37:10.395
Even killing sweet Cornell?

37:14.107 --> 37:19.404
He wasn't sweet anymore,
after what you did to him.

37:19.487 --> 37:20.488
Hey!

37:21.406 --> 37:24.242
Lay off her, Maybelline.
She's doing the best she can.

37:25.535 --> 37:27.495
We agree about the drug game.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.622
I said the same thing.

37:29.706 --> 37:32.751
You was always smart, tough.

37:34.794 --> 37:35.879
Beautiful.

37:38.381 --> 37:39.966
Just like I molded you.

37:40.049 --> 37:41.509
Shut up.

37:41.593 --> 37:44.554
I forgive you
for telling Cornell to shoot me.

37:44.637 --> 37:48.057
That was me, you disloyal nigga.

37:48.141 --> 37:49.309
Mmm-mmm.

37:49.392 --> 37:51.227
She pushed it over the top.

37:51.936 --> 37:54.230
Just like our daughter is doing now.

37:54.314 --> 37:57.233
You keep Tilda's name
out of your filthy mouth.

37:58.067 --> 38:01.154
She's more ambitious than both of us.

38:01.237 --> 38:03.615
Guess that's how it's supposed to be.

38:03.698 --> 38:06.326
Her uncle ain't supposed to be her daddy!

38:08.703 --> 38:10.955
Walk slowly, Pete.

38:11.039 --> 38:14.292
She is clearly working some shit out.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.085
This is my world.

38:18.004 --> 38:21.633
I'm owed! I am owed!

38:22.759 --> 38:28.640
And before I'm done,
I will control this whole goddamn city!

38:29.224 --> 38:31.392
Got it? Got it?

38:38.316 --> 38:41.986
Everyone will want to know
you're alive. Where you have been.

38:42.654 --> 38:45.907
All right, then. Make the call.

38:55.500 --> 38:56.960
What was the cost?

38:57.043 --> 39:01.297
After what my family did...
I feel like I owe you.

39:01.381 --> 39:03.967
No. I'm talking about my body.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.052
What was the cost?

39:07.011 --> 39:10.306
Nightshade poisoned your internal organs.

39:10.390 --> 39:12.225
- Liver, spleen...
- Am I dying?

39:12.809 --> 39:13.935
It's not good.

39:14.769 --> 39:16.145
I cheated death before.

39:16.729 --> 39:19.983
And maybe you'll cheat it again,
but right now you're living on credit.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.569
My credit's good, yeah?

39:28.700 --> 39:29.701
What?

39:31.452 --> 39:32.453
Anansi...

39:33.204 --> 39:34.289
What happened?

39:36.583 --> 39:37.584
Tell me.

39:41.421 --> 39:42.881
- I can't.
- Tell me.

39:52.015 --> 39:55.059
- Same gun.
- Same markings and everything.

39:55.143 --> 39:57.604
Links Mariah to all three homicides.

39:57.687 --> 40:00.106
Scarfe was a patrol cop
on this Pistol Pete Stokes case.

40:00.189 --> 40:02.692
- Filed the missing persons report.
- Ugh. Come on, Priscilla.

40:02.775 --> 40:03.902
DA's not gonna touch anything

40:03.985 --> 40:05.820
with Scarfe's name on it
with a ten-foot pole.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.989
Fine. We'll nail Mariah on the other two.

40:08.072 --> 40:10.825
Without the gun,
it's circumstantial at best.

40:11.492 --> 40:13.912
We need a living, breathing witness.

40:15.121 --> 40:16.456
Where's Ingrid Mackintosh?

40:17.498 --> 40:18.583
I'm on it.

40:21.878 --> 40:24.380
<i>What the hell
do you mean she won't testify?</i>

40:24.464 --> 40:27.383
She's been through hell.
I'm not gonna make her go back, okay?

40:27.467 --> 40:31.804
Did you tell her that we will protect her,
give her whatever she needs?

40:31.888 --> 40:33.348
Right now, all she wants to do

40:33.431 --> 40:37.101
is take Anansi's body back to Jamaica
and be done with this.

40:37.185 --> 40:38.561
Never see Mariah again.

40:38.645 --> 40:41.147
She wouldn't have to take
his body anywhere

40:41.230 --> 40:44.442
if Mariah didn't murder him in cold blood!

40:45.151 --> 40:47.028
Luke, what is wrong with you?

40:47.111 --> 40:49.739
A few hours ago,
you wanted Mariah's head on a platter.

40:50.365 --> 40:54.077
And we'll get it. Okay?
Just not like this.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.871
<i>Not at the cost of Ingrid's sanity.</i>

40:56.955 --> 40:59.749
Look, she just wants to go home. Okay?

41:01.292 --> 41:02.502
I'm sorry, Misty.

41:53.678 --> 41:55.471
This attack was meant for me.

41:56.764 --> 41:57.765
Not them.

42:04.939 --> 42:06.149
What about her?

42:07.483 --> 42:08.317
Hmm?

42:10.111 --> 42:12.739
You want her to run back to her mother?

42:16.826 --> 42:18.286
Let her go.

42:28.629 --> 42:29.881
Thank you.

42:32.675 --> 42:34.093
I'm so sorry.

43:12.882 --> 43:14.425
Do you want another?

43:14.509 --> 43:16.511
I should go, Madam Councilwoman.

43:16.594 --> 43:17.762
Oh, God, Alex.

43:18.638 --> 43:21.682
Mariah. I insist.

43:25.770 --> 43:27.188
Well, that was quick.

43:29.649 --> 43:30.650
No.

43:32.318 --> 43:34.195
Alex has always been loyal.

43:34.946 --> 43:39.450
His value is appreciating
just when I need it.

43:41.202 --> 43:43.996
- Leave.
- I say when he goes. Not you.

43:51.129 --> 43:52.839
I'll see you tomorrow, Madam.

44:02.181 --> 44:06.185
What the hell was that?
Are you jealous or some shit?

44:06.769 --> 44:07.770
No.

44:08.771 --> 44:09.981
Not at all.

44:11.315 --> 44:16.320
It's actually like I'm seeing you
all over again for the first time.

44:17.822 --> 44:22.118
There's a code of the streets.
Actual rules to this shit.

44:23.077 --> 44:26.664
Innocent people are dead, Mariah.
You broke the rules.

44:29.584 --> 44:31.169
Candace was innocent.

44:32.086 --> 44:35.131
You had no problem blowing her brains out.

44:35.214 --> 44:37.508
She was guilty the second
she took our money.

44:37.925 --> 44:40.344
She broke the rules
when she started snitching.

44:40.428 --> 44:42.096
And I was protecting you.

44:42.180 --> 44:43.472
But dead is dead.

44:44.098 --> 44:45.766
Are you a vegan now?

44:46.392 --> 44:49.896
You've been a goddamn carnivore
the whole time I've known you.

44:49.979 --> 44:53.649
A predator. I loved that.

44:55.484 --> 44:57.403
Did you kill the bitch or what?

44:58.654 --> 44:59.655
I'm done.

45:00.823 --> 45:02.575
She could go to the cops, Hernan.

45:03.284 --> 45:06.579
If I go down, you go down.

45:06.662 --> 45:09.790
Your ass was right next to me
the whole time, firing.

45:09.874 --> 45:13.085
I told you to use the old man as leverage.

45:13.753 --> 45:16.172
You didn't have to kill all those people.

45:16.255 --> 45:19.175
You knew what was gonna happen
when you found that place.

45:19.258 --> 45:21.135
That's why you scouted it.

45:21.218 --> 45:25.431
Bushmaster started this war.
I'm just ending it.

45:25.514 --> 45:27.183
You lost your heart, Mariah.

45:29.602 --> 45:31.354
It was the best part of you.

45:32.605 --> 45:36.359
I saw your face...
when that old man was burning.

45:38.611 --> 45:39.737
You never even blinked.

45:40.321 --> 45:43.115
Well, I'm still all heart, my bae.
Best believe.

45:43.866 --> 45:47.328
But I am done babysitting.

45:49.997 --> 45:53.084
You said,
"Your first is always the hardest."

45:53.960 --> 45:55.378
And then it gets easier.

45:58.422 --> 45:59.674
You were correct.

46:01.884 --> 46:04.428
You were right there for me, Hernan.

46:04.512 --> 46:05.972
Remember?

46:07.723 --> 46:09.350
We were downstairs.

46:12.687 --> 46:15.064
I had never been so scared in my life.

46:17.358 --> 46:18.943
Then I heard a voice.

46:21.654 --> 46:23.447
- It was yours.
- Hmm.

46:25.241 --> 46:28.995
It was so... calm.

46:30.162 --> 46:32.081
And so strong.

46:34.583 --> 46:38.754
If I wasn't covered in blood, I would have
straddled you right there on the bar.

46:40.297 --> 46:45.428
You saw who I was from the start,
and you wanted that.

46:47.763 --> 46:50.391
You made me who I am.

46:51.559 --> 46:53.102
You made me...

46:55.730 --> 46:59.817
You really are a crazy-ass bitch.

47:00.693 --> 47:02.570
- Get back here.
- Get off me.

47:03.320 --> 47:07.950
You have been off-kilter
ever since dirty-ass snitch died.

47:08.659 --> 47:10.119
Oh, what's his name?

47:14.582 --> 47:18.502
Yeah. All those looks he gave me.

47:19.587 --> 47:21.172
All that heat.

47:23.174 --> 47:27.053
So y'all was just gay for the stay?

47:28.471 --> 47:31.974
Or was it a true <i>Brokeback</i> romance?

47:35.227 --> 47:36.937
No surprises.

47:37.772 --> 47:41.609
A woman knows who her man
has played around with.

47:42.693 --> 47:47.740
I just wish I had pulled the trigger
on Comanche's snitchin' black ass.

47:48.657 --> 47:50.576
I would've popped him twice in the gut,

47:51.410 --> 47:53.287
so he could bleed out slow.

47:53.371 --> 47:55.039
And you could watch!

48:27.071 --> 48:28.906
You ain't even worth the effort.

48:32.368 --> 48:33.577
You're pathetic.

48:37.623 --> 48:41.085
You get back here!

48:42.336 --> 48:44.088
I'm not done with you.

48:45.381 --> 48:47.925
You don't walk away from me, Hernan!

48:55.850 --> 48:57.059
Hernan!

49:14.243 --> 49:16.245
I thought you left town.

49:16.871 --> 49:18.330
Did you do it?

49:19.748 --> 49:21.167
Did I do what?

49:21.250 --> 49:22.835
The restaurant.

49:23.544 --> 49:25.212
All those people. Did you...

49:27.214 --> 49:28.716
Did you give the order?

49:29.258 --> 49:30.718
Give the order?

49:33.012 --> 49:35.723
I lit the goddamn match.

49:37.224 --> 49:39.059
And pulled the trigger.

49:41.187 --> 49:42.730
Goodbye, Mother.

50:03.542 --> 50:06.420
- Whoa, I ain't here for that.
- Then what are you here for?

50:11.759 --> 50:13.677
Mariah's gone too far this time.

50:14.220 --> 50:15.346
She's gotta go.

50:17.431 --> 50:19.141
And I'm gonna help you do it.

50:36.116 --> 50:37.159
Uncle...

50:40.496 --> 50:41.664
I'm sorry.

50:51.423 --> 50:52.758
Don't start!

50:53.384 --> 50:55.177
The two of you need to talk.

50:55.886 --> 50:58.472
- I need my time with Paul.
- Auntie, but...

51:21.412 --> 51:25.082
Thank you for keeping my auntie safe.

51:26.292 --> 51:31.255
- The kindness will not be forgotten, yeah?
- Kindness got nothing to do with it.

51:31.380 --> 51:35.509
- It was the right thing to do.
- The right thing to do. Wrong thing to do.

51:35.592 --> 51:37.761
You think too simply, Luke Cage.

51:38.762 --> 51:41.056
The world's a more complicated place,
you know?

51:41.140 --> 51:43.934
Don't tell me how complicated
the world is, man.

51:44.018 --> 51:45.394
You don't know me.

51:45.936 --> 51:47.646
The pain that I carry inside.

51:48.856 --> 51:50.441
My whole life is pain.

51:50.524 --> 51:52.276
You think that makes you special?

51:56.405 --> 51:57.823
To be honest,

51:57.906 --> 52:00.617
I'd love to see you and Mariah
kill each other.

52:02.202 --> 52:05.914
But in this story,
I guess I'm the good guy.

52:07.374 --> 52:09.043
And I can't let that happen.

52:18.010 --> 52:19.553
You and me...

52:20.929 --> 52:22.890
we're not so different, you know?

52:24.516 --> 52:25.893
We could have been bredren.

52:29.271 --> 52:33.400
Well, I never had much luck with brothers,
to be honest.

52:37.112 --> 52:38.322
Walk away.

52:39.740 --> 52:40.741
For good.

52:42.409 --> 52:44.078
Because if we mix it up again,

52:45.371 --> 52:48.582
I'll make sure
you don't walk away this time.

52:49.875 --> 52:50.876
Feel me?

52:53.212 --> 52:54.546
I'll be ready.

52:57.758 --> 53:00.386
I'm not looking forward
to killing you, yeah?

53:08.894 --> 53:11.438
Auntie... Auntie, come, come, come.

53:31.083 --> 53:32.334
Why are you following me, man?

53:32.418 --> 53:34.128
I came looking for you at the barbershop.

53:34.211 --> 53:35.754
Mariah sent you alone?

53:35.838 --> 53:38.549
I don't work for Mariah no more.
She's crazy.

53:39.967 --> 53:43.387
Call the cops. Turn yourself in.
Nothing I can do.

53:43.470 --> 53:45.639
That's not gonna do anything.

53:45.722 --> 53:50.394
Look around, man. Shit is out of control.
Somebody's gotta take it over.

53:51.353 --> 53:53.605
Harlem doesn't need a sheriff anymore.

53:55.524 --> 53:56.567
You're right.

53:57.901 --> 53:59.153
It needs a king.

54:01.822 --> 54:02.906
Let's talk.
