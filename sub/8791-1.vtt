is <i>''Carpe diem. ''</i>

13:39.523 --> 13:41.718
Now, who knows what that means?

13:43.083 --> 13:45.392
<i>Carpe diem.</i>
That's ''Seize the day.''

13:45.483 --> 13:47.314
- Very good, Mister--
<i>- Meeks.</i>

13:47.403 --> 13:50.520
Meeks.
Another unusual name.

13:50.603 --> 13:52.719
Seize the day.

13:52.803 --> 13:56.239
''Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.''

13:56.323 --> 13:58.518
Why does the writer
use these lines?

13:58.603 --> 14:01.322
- Because he's in a hurry.
- No! Ding!

14:01.403 --> 14:03.553
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for playing anyway.</i>

14:05.443 --> 14:08.879
Because we are food
for worms, lads.

14:08.963 --> 14:11.636
Because, believe it or not,
each and every one of us in this room...

14:11.723 --> 14:16.922
<i>is one day going to stop breathing,</i>
<i>turn cold and die.</i>

14:18.723 --> 14:21.191
I would like you
to step forward over here...

14:21.283 --> 14:23.751
and peruse some of the faces
from the past.

14:23.843 --> 14:27.995
You've walked past them
many times. I don't think
you've really looked at them.

14:33.483 --> 14:36.043
<i>They're not that different</i>
<i>from you, are they?</i>

14:36.123 --> 14:38.683
<i>Same haircuts.</i>

14:38.763 --> 14:41.755
Full of hormones,
just like you.

14:41.843 --> 14:47.042
Invincible, just like you feel.
The world is their oyster.

14:47.123 --> 14:50.115
They believe they're destined for
great things, just like many of you.

14:50.203 --> 14:52.353
<i>Their eyes are full of hope,</i>
<i>just like you.</i>

14:52.443 --> 14:55.003
<i>Did they wait</i>
<i>until it was too late...</i>

14:55.083 --> 14:58.393
<i>to make from their lives even one iota</i>
<i>of what they were capable?</i>

14:58.483 --> 15:03.352
<i>Because, you see, gentlemen, these</i>
<i>boys are now fertilizing daffodils.</i>

15:05.003 --> 15:07.801
But if you listen
real close...

15:07.883 --> 15:10.681
you can hear them whisper
their legacy to you.

15:10.763 --> 15:12.594
Go on, lean in.

15:12.683 --> 15:18.076
<i>Listen.</i>
<i>Do you hear it?</i>

15:24.203 --> 15:26.353
<i>[ Keating Whispering ]</i>
Carpe.

15:28.763 --> 15:31.482
Hear it?

15:31.563 --> 15:36.683
[ Whispering ]
<i>Carpe.</i>

15:36.763 --> 15:41.883
<i>[ Continues Whispering ]</i>
Carpe diem.

15:41.963 --> 15:46.514
<i>Seize the day, boys.</i>

15:46.603 --> 15:51.882
<i>Make your lives</i>
<i>extraordinary.</i>

16:00.603 --> 16:04.596
[ Chattering ]

16:04.683 --> 16:07.322
- That was weird.
- But different.

16:07.403 --> 16:09.871
Spooky, if you ask me.

16:09.963 --> 16:11.954
Think he'll test us
on that stuff?

16:12.043 --> 16:15.001
Oh, come on, Cameron.
Don't you get anything?

16:15.083 --> 16:17.074
What? What?

16:17.163 --> 16:19.154
[ Charlie Scoffs ]

16:19.243 --> 16:22.918
Let's go, boys. Hustle up in here.
That means you, Dalton!

16:23.003 --> 16:25.153
Who's up for a quick
study group tonight, guys?

16:25.243 --> 16:27.234
- [ Cameron, Pitts ] Me.
- What?

16:27.323 --> 16:30.599
I can't make it, guys. I have to have
dinner at the Danburrys' house tonight.

16:30.683 --> 16:32.514
<i>[ Pitts ] The Danburrys?</i>
<i>Who are the Danburrys?</i>

16:32.603 --> 16:34.434
[ Cameron ] Big alums.
How'd you swing that?

16:34.523 --> 16:36.832
Friends of my dad's. They're probably
in their nineties or something.

16:36.923 --> 16:38.276
Ooh!

16:38.363 --> 16:40.672
Anything's better
than Hell-ton hash, Knox.

16:40.763 --> 16:43.231
- [ Charlie ] I'll second that.
<i>- [ Knox ] Yeah, we'll see.</i>

16:43.323 --> 16:46.918
- You coming to the study group tonight?
- [ Others Chattering ]

16:47.003 --> 16:50.757
Uh... no. No, I--
Uh, I've got some history I wanna do.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.482
- Suit yourself.
<i>- [ Laughing ]</i>

17:25.163 --> 17:26.993
Ready, Overstreet?

17:29.003 --> 17:31.198
Ready to go, sir.

17:55.083 --> 17:57.392
<i>- [ Doorbell Ringing ]</i>
<i>- [ Woman ] Chet, can you get that?</i>

17:57.483 --> 17:59.474
<i>- [ Chet ] I can't, Mom.</i>
<i>- [ Girl ] I'll get it!</i>

18:04.643 --> 18:07.157
Can I help you?

18:07.243 --> 18:10.679
Hi. Knox Overstreet.

18:10.763 --> 18:14.358
- Uh, Dr Hager.
<i>- [ Girl ] Hi.</i>

18:14.443 --> 18:16.240
This is the Danburrys',
right?

18:16.323 --> 18:19.474
- Are you here to see Chet?
- Mrs Danburry?

18:19.563 --> 18:23.476
- [ Laughing ] No.
<i>- Sorry. Thank you. I'm Mrs Danburry.</i>

18:23.563 --> 18:25.394
- You must be Knox.
- Yes.

18:25.483 --> 18:28.122
Back by 9:00?
Please, come on in.

18:28.203 --> 18:30.034
<i>- [ Chet ] Chris, come on!</i>
<i>- [ Chris ] Chet, I'm coming.</i>

18:30.123 --> 18:32.398
Knox. How are you?
Joe Danburry.

18:32.483 --> 18:35.122
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- He's the spitting image of his father.

18:35.203 --> 18:37.034
- [ Chuckling ] How is he? Come on in.
<i>- [ Chet ] Chris!</i>

18:37.123 --> 18:39.591
- Great. He just did a big case for G.M.
- I know where you're headed.

18:39.683 --> 18:41.913
<i>- [ Chris ] I'm coming.</i>
- Like father, like son, huh?

18:43.523 --> 18:45.400
<i>[ Boy ]</i>
<i>Ooh! Psycho!</i>

18:45.483 --> 18:47.872
- Yes!
- To Queen-Six.

18:47.963 --> 18:50.477
<i>-Another game?</i>
<i>- What do you mean?</i>
- Duh!

18:50.563 --> 18:53.680
<i>just replace these numbers here</i>
<i>with 'x, ''for 'x''and 'y. ''</i>

18:53.763 --> 18:56.197
- Of course.
- Of course. So what's the problem?

18:56.283 --> 18:58.843
<i>[ Boy ] You think I can get in there?</i>
<i>You've been hogging it all day.</i>

18:58.923 --> 19:00.914
- Wait. No.
- How was dinner?

19:01.003 --> 19:02.959
Huh?

19:03.043 --> 19:06.558
<i>- How was dinner?</i>
- Terrible.

19:07.883 --> 19:11.432
- Awful.
<i>- Why? What happened?</i>

19:11.523 --> 19:14.162
[ Sighs ]

19:14.243 --> 19:18.634
Tonight, I met
the most beautiful girl...

19:18.723 --> 19:21.032
I have ever seen
in my entire life.

19:21.123 --> 19:23.717
Are you crazy?
What's wrong with that?

19:23.803 --> 19:27.762
<i>She's practically engaged</i>
<i>to Chet Danburry.</i>

19:27.843 --> 19:29.401
- [ Groans ]
- That guy could eat a football.

19:29.483 --> 19:31.474
- Too bad.
<i>- [ Knox ] ''Too bad''?</i>

19:31.563 --> 19:33.997
It's worse than ''too bad,''
Pittsie. It's a tragedy.

19:34.083 --> 19:36.722
A girl this beautiful
in love with such a jerk.

19:36.803 --> 19:39.158
All the good ones go for jerks.
You know that.

19:39.243 --> 19:41.677
Yeah, forget her. Open your trig book
and try and figure out problem five.

19:41.763 --> 19:44.072
I can't just forget her, Cameron.

19:44.163 --> 19:46.916
And I certainly
can't think about trig.

19:47.003 --> 19:49.073
- [ Radio Humming ]
- We got it!

19:49.163 --> 19:51.802
All right, gentlemen.
Five minutes.

19:51.883 --> 19:54.192
- [ Radio Continues Humming ]
- Let's go.

19:54.283 --> 19:57.832
- Did you see her naked? [ Chuckles ]
- Very funny, Dalton.

19:57.923 --> 20:00.756
<i>- [ Radio Static ]</i>
- That wouldn't be a radio in your lap,

20:00.843 --> 20:05.075
<i>- would it, Mr Pitts?</i>
- No, sir. Science experiment.

20:05.163 --> 20:07.154
<i>Radar.</i>

20:07.243 --> 20:11.316
[ Radio Continues Humming ]

20:11.563 --> 20:16.159
Gentlemen, open your text
to page 2 1 of the introduction.

20:16.243 --> 20:19.519
Mr Perry, will you read
the opening paragraph of the preface,

20:19.603 --> 20:21.673
entitled
''Understanding Poetry.''

20:22.963 --> 20:27.514
'''Understand Poetry'
by Dr J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D.

20:27.603 --> 20:30.242
''To fully understand poetry,
we must first be fluent...

20:30.323 --> 20:33.121
''with its metre, rhyme
and figures of speech.

20:33.203 --> 20:35.034
<i>''Then ask two questions.</i>

20:35.123 --> 20:37.273
<i>''One.: How artfully has the objective</i>
<i>of the poem been rendered?</i>

20:37.363 --> 20:40.719
<i>'And, two.: How important</i>
<i>is that objective?</i>

20:40.803 --> 20:42.634
<i>''Question one rates</i>
<i>the poem's perfection.</i>

20:42.723 --> 20:44.634
<i>''Question two rates</i>
<i>its importance.</i>

20:44.723 --> 20:47.032
<i>'And once these questions</i>
<i>have been answered...</i>

20:47.123 --> 20:50.399
<i>''determining a poem's greatness</i>
<i>becomes a relatively simple matter.</i>

20:50.483 --> 20:52.951
<i>''If the poem's score</i>
<i>for perfection is plotted...</i>

20:53.043 --> 20:55.034
<i>''on the horizontal</i>
<i>of a graph...</i>

20:55.123 --> 20:58.399
<i>''and its importance</i>
<i>is plotted on the vertical,</i>

20:58.483 --> 21:01.600
''then calculating
the total area of the poem...

21:01.683 --> 21:04.277
''yields the measure
of its greatness.

21:06.763 --> 21:11.791
''A sonnet by Byron might
score high on the vertical,

21:11.883 --> 21:14.681
<i>''but only average</i>
<i>on the horizontal.</i>

21:14.763 --> 21:17.835
<i>'A Shakespearean sonnet,</i>
<i>on the other hand,</i>

21:17.923 --> 21:21.120
''would score high both
horizontally and vertically,

21:21.203 --> 21:23.034
<i>'yielding</i>
<i>a massive total area;:</i>

21:23.123 --> 21:26.320
''thereby revealing
the poem to be truly great.

21:26.403 --> 21:30.999
<i>'As you proceed through the poetry in</i>
<i>this book, practise this rating method.</i>

21:31.083 --> 21:33.677
<i>'As your ability to evaluate</i>
<i>poems in this manner grows,</i>

21:33.763 --> 21:39.315
so will-- so will your enjoyment
and understanding of poetry.''

21:43.563 --> 21:45.394
Excrement.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.998
That's what I think
of Mr J. Evans Pritchard.

21:50.083 --> 21:53.075
<i>We're not laying pipe.</i>
<i>We're talking about poetry.</i>

21:53.163 --> 21:56.280
<i>I mean, how can you describe poetry</i>
<i>like</i> American Bandstand?

21:56.363 --> 22:01.039
''I like Byron. I give him a 42.
But I can't dance to it.''

22:01.123 --> 22:04.081
<i>Now, I want you</i>
<i>to rip out that page.</i>

22:04.163 --> 22:07.394

<i>You heard me.</i>
<i>Rip it out.</i>

22:12.483 --> 22:14.838
<i>Rip it out!</i>

22:14.923 --> 22:16.959

22:18.283 --> 22:20.592
<i>Thank you, Mr Dalton.</i>

<i>Gentlemen, tell you what.</i>
<i>Don't just tear out that page.</i>

22:22.683 --> 22:27.313
<i>Tear out the entire introduction.</i>
<i>I want it gone, history. Leave nothing.</i>

Mr McAllister.

23:16.003 --> 23:20.315

I didn't know you were here.

Excuse me.

Keep ripping, gentlemen.

23:32.083 --> 23:34.677
<i>This is a battle, a war.</i>

23:34.763 --> 23:36.754
And the casualties could be
your hearts and souls.

23:36.843 --> 23:38.674
Thank you, Mr Dalton.

23:38.763 --> 23:41.721
Armies of academics
going forward measuring poetry.

23:41.803 --> 23:43.634
<i>No! We will not</i>
<i>have that here.</i>

23:43.723 --> 23:45.554
<i>No more</i>
<i>of MrJ. Evans Pritchard.</i>

23:45.643 --> 23:48.760
<i>Now, my class, you will learn</i>
<i>to think for yourselves again.</i>

23:48.843 --> 23:52.233
You will learn
to savour words and language.

23:52.323 --> 23:54.518
No matter what
anybody tells you,

23:54.603 --> 23:58.198
words and ideas
<i>can</i> change the world.

23:58.283 --> 24:00.558
I see that look
in Mr Pitts' eye...

24:00.643 --> 24:02.793
like 1 9th century literature
has nothing to do...

24:02.883 --> 24:04.714
with going to business school
or medical school.

24:04.803 --> 24:06.634
Right? Maybe.

24:06.723 --> 24:08.714
Mr Hopkins, you may agree
with him, thinking,

24:08.803 --> 24:11.920
''Yes, we should simply study
our Mr Pritchard...

24:12.003 --> 24:14.801
''and learn our rhyme and metre
and go quietly about the business...

24:14.883 --> 24:17.841
of achieving other ambitions.''

24:17.923 --> 24:20.721
I have a little secret for you.
Huddle up.

24:20.803 --> 24:22.634
Huddle up!

24:30.243 --> 24:33.519
We don't read and write
poetry because it's cute.

24:33.603 --> 24:38.154
We read and write poetry because
we are members of the human race.

24:38.243 --> 24:42.794
And the human race
is filled with passion.

24:42.883 --> 24:45.351
Medicine, law,
business, engineering:

24:45.443 --> 24:48.480
these are noble pursuits
and necessary to sustain life.

24:48.563 --> 24:50.952
But poetry,

24:51.043 --> 24:54.956
beauty, romance, love--

24:55.043 --> 24:57.511
these are what
we stay alive for.

24:57.603 --> 25:00.322
<i>To quote from Whitman.:</i>

25:00.403 --> 25:04.282
<i>''O me, O life of the questions</i>
<i>of these recurring.</i>

<i>''Of the endless trains</i>
<i>of the faithless.</i>

<i>''Of cities filled</i>
<i>with the foolish.</i>

''What good amid these,

''That the powerful play

Quite an interesting class

26:05.483 --> 26:08.281
- Sorry if I shocked you, Mr McAllister.
- There's no need to apologise.

26:08.363 --> 26:11.321
It was very fascinating,
misguided though it was.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.234
You think so?

26:13.323 --> 26:16.440
You take a big risk by encouraging them
to become artists,John.

26:16.523 --> 26:20.118
When they realize that they're
not Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts,

26:20.203 --> 26:21.716
they'll hate you for it.

26:21.803 --> 26:25.079
We're not talking artists, George.
We're talking freethinkers.

26:25.163 --> 26:27.472
Freethinkers at 1 7?

26:27.563 --> 26:29.394
Funny, I never pegged you
as a cynic.

26:31.723 --> 26:34.317
Not a cynic.

26:34.403 --> 26:36.280
<i>A realist.</i>

26:36.363 --> 26:40.276
''Show me the heart unfettered
by foolish dreams,

26:40.363 --> 26:42.479
and I'll show you
a happy man.''

26:42.563 --> 26:46.033
''But only in their dreams
can men be truly free.

26:46.123 --> 26:48.956
'Twas always thus,
and always thus will be.''

26:49.043 --> 26:50.999
Tennyson?

26:51.083 --> 26:53.153
No. Keating.

26:54.443 --> 26:56.718
[ Chuckling ]

26:57.803 --> 27:00.271
Hey, I found his senior
annual in the library.

27:00.363 --> 27:03.275
<i>Listen to this.</i>
<i>Captain of the soccer team.</i>

27:03.363 --> 27:06.161
<i>Editor of the school annual.</i>
<i>Cambridge bound.</i>

27:06.243 --> 27:09.280
Thigh man
and the Dead Poets Society.

27:09.363 --> 27:11.957
''Man Most Likely
To Do Anything.''

27:12.043 --> 27:15.274
Thigh man?
Mr ''K'' was a hell-raiser.

27:15.363 --> 27:17.957
- [ Chuckling ]
- What's the Dead Poets Society?

27:18.043 --> 27:19.874
- I don't know.
- Is there a picture in the annual?

27:19.963 --> 27:21.794
- Nothing. No other mention of it.
<i>- [ Nolan ] That boy there,</i>

27:21.883 --> 27:23.714
<i>see me after lunch.</i>

27:25.203 --> 27:27.080
## [ Whistling <i>1 8 1 2 Overture</i> ]

27:27.163 --> 27:28.994
[ Neil ]
Mr Keating?

27:29.083 --> 27:31.677
- ## [ Continues Whistling ]
- Mr Keating?

27:31.763 --> 27:34.197
- ## [ Continues ]
<i>- Sir?</i>

27:34.283 --> 27:36.922
- Say something.
- O Captain, my Captain?

27:37.003 --> 27:39.392
- Gentlemen.
- [ Boys Laugh ]

27:39.483 --> 27:42.919
We were just looking
in your old annual.

27:43.003 --> 27:45.198
- Oh, my God. [ Laughs ]
- [ Laughing ]

27:45.283 --> 27:48.514
- No, that's not me.

27:48.603 --> 27:51.436
Stanley ''The Tool'' Wilson.

27:51.523 --> 27:53.753
[ Chuckling ]

27:53.843 --> 27:57.358
<i>- [ Chuckling ] God.</i>
- What was the Dead Poets Society?

28:01.523 --> 28:04.913
I doubt the present administration
would look too favourably upon that.

28:05.003 --> 28:07.563
Why?
What was it?

28:10.283 --> 28:14.322
- Gentlemen, can you keep a secret?
- Sure.

28:16.523 --> 28:21.881
The Dead Poets were dedicated
to sucking the marrow out of life.

28:21.963 --> 28:25.080
That's a phrase from Thoreau we'd invoke
at the beginning of every meeting.

28:25.163 --> 28:27.631
You see, we would gather
at the old Indian cave...

28:27.723 --> 28:32.080
and take turns reading from Thoreau,
Whitman, Shelley-- the biggies.

28:32.163 --> 28:33.881
<i>Even some of our own verse.</i>

28:33.963 --> 28:37.433
And in the enchantment of the moment,
we'd let poetry work its magic.

28:37.523 --> 28:40.595
You mean it was a bunch of guys
sitting around, reading poetry?

28:40.683 --> 28:43.481
No, Mr Overstreet.
It wasn't just <i>guys.</i>

28:43.563 --> 28:46.680
We weren't a Greek organization.
We were romantics.

28:46.763 --> 28:51.598
We didn't just read poetry, we let it
drip from our tongues, like honey.

28:51.683 --> 28:56.120
<i>Spirits soared, women swooned</i>
<i>and gods were created, gentlemen.</i>

28:56.203 --> 28:58.558
Not a bad way
to spend an evening, eh?

28:58.643 --> 28:59.917
Hmm.

29:00.003 --> 29:02.676
Thank you, Mr Perry,
for this stroll down amnesia lane.

29:02.763 --> 29:04.719
Burn that.

29:04.803 --> 29:07.476
<i>- Especially my picture.</i>
- [ Boys Chuckle ]

29:07.563 --> 29:12.762

29:14.803 --> 29:18.352

29:18.443 --> 29:20.593
- I say we go tonight.
- Tonight?

29:20.683 --> 29:22.674
- Wait a minute.
- Everybody in?

29:22.763 --> 29:24.754
- Where's this cave he's talking about?
- It's beyond the stream.

29:24.843 --> 29:27.152
- I know where it is.
- [ Pitts ] That's miles.

29:27.243 --> 29:30.315
- Sounds boring to me.
<i>- [ Charlie ] Don't go.</i>

29:30.403 --> 29:32.758
- You know how many
demerits we're talking?
- So don't come. Please.

29:32.843 --> 29:35.152
Look, all I'm saying
is that we have to be careful.

29:35.243 --> 29:38.235
- We can't get caught.
- No shit, Sherlock.

29:38.323 --> 29:41.076
You boys there!
Hurry up!

29:41.163 --> 29:44.121
- All right, who's in?
- Aw, come on, Neil. Hager's--

29:44.203 --> 29:47.434
Forget Hager! No!
Who's in?

29:47.523 --> 29:49.275
I'm in.

29:50.403 --> 29:52.917
<i>[ Hager Clapping ]</i>
<i>I'm warning you! Move!</i>

29:53.003 --> 29:54.072
Me too.

29:54.163 --> 29:56.438
- I don't know, Neil.
- What? Pitts!

29:56.523 --> 29:58.354
<i>- [ Charlie ] Pittsie, come on.</i>
<i>- [ Meeks ] His grades are hurting.</i>

29:58.443 --> 30:01.037
- You can help him, Meeks.
- What is this, a midnight study group?

30:01.123 --> 30:03.762
Forget it, Pitts. You're coming.
Meeks, your grades hurting too?

30:03.843 --> 30:06.073
- I'll try anything once.
<i>- [ Charlie ] Except sex.</i>

30:06.163 --> 30:08.393
<i>- [ Meeks ] Ha, ha, ha.</i>
<i>- I'm in as long as we're careful.</i>

30:08.483 --> 30:10.951
- What about you, Knox?
- I don't know, Charlie.

30:11.043 --> 30:13.034
Come on, Knox.
It'll help you get Chris.

30:13.123 --> 30:14.954
Yeah? How?

30:15.043 --> 30:18.638
- Women swoon. [ Laughing ]
- But why do they swoon?

30:18.723 --> 30:22.033
Charlie, tell me why they swoon!
Charlie!

30:22.283 --> 30:24.399
[ Boys Whispering ]

30:24.483 --> 30:26.838
[ Neil Whispering ] Okay,
follow the stream to the waterfall.

30:26.923 --> 30:28.754
It's right there.
It's got to be on the banks.

30:28.843 --> 30:30.674
I don't know.
This is starting to sound dangerous.

30:30.763 --> 30:34.039
- Oh, well, why don't you stay home?
- Hey, you're crazy.

30:34.123 --> 30:37.832
For God's sake,
stop chattering and sit down.

30:44.563 --> 30:47.157
- Todd, are you coming tonight?
- No.

30:47.243 --> 30:49.234
Why not? God, you were there.
You heard Keating.

30:49.323 --> 30:51.598
- Don't you want
to do something about that?
- Yes.

30:51.683 --> 30:55.801
- But--
- But? But what?

30:57.523 --> 31:01.118
Keating said that everybody
took turns reading,

31:01.203 --> 31:03.842
and I don't want to do that.

31:03.923 --> 31:05.993
Gosh, you really have
a problem with that, don't you?

31:08.083 --> 31:10.392
N-No, I don't have a problem.

31:10.483 --> 31:13.680
Neil, I just--
I don't want to do it, okay?

31:13.763 --> 31:16.152
All right.

31:16.243 --> 31:19.679
What if you didn't have to read?
What if you just came and listened?

31:19.763 --> 31:22.721
- That's not how it works.
- Well, forget how it works.

31:22.803 --> 31:26.557
What if--
What if they said it was okay?

31:26.643 --> 31:29.396
What-- What, are you gonna
go up and ask them?

31:29.483 --> 31:32.122
No.
No, Neil.

The meetings will be

35:08.963 --> 35:10.954
and the other
new initiates now present.

35:11.043 --> 35:12.999
Todd Anderson, because
he prefers not to read,

35:13.083 --> 35:15.472
<i>will keep minutes</i>
<i>of the meetings.</i>

35:15.563 --> 35:18.475
I'll now read
the traditional opening message...

35:18.563 --> 35:20.394
by Society member
Henry David Thoreau.

35:20.483 --> 35:23.281
''I went to the woods because
I wanted to live deliberately.

35:23.363 --> 35:25.923
I wanted to live deep and suck
out all the marrow of life.''

35:26.003 --> 35:27.516
I'll second that.
[ Laughs ]

35:27.603 --> 35:29.992
''To put to rout
all that was not life.

35:30.083 --> 35:31.835
''And not,
when I had come to die,

35:31.923 --> 35:34.198
discover
that I had not lived.''

35:34.283 --> 35:37.559
[ Whistles ]

35:37.643 --> 35:40.601
- Keating's marked
a bunch of other pages.
<i>-All right, intermission!</i>

Dig deep. Right here.
Right here, lay it down.

<i>- Come on!</i>
<i>- What, you want me to put it back?</i>

36:02.363 --> 36:05.275
It was a dark and rainy night,
and this old lady,

36:05.363 --> 36:07.513
who had a passion
for jigsaw puzzles,

36:07.603 --> 36:11.960
sat by herself in her house at her table
to complete a new jigsaw puzzle.

36:12.043 --> 36:14.716
But as she pieced
the puzzle together,

36:14.803 --> 36:16.634
she realized,
to her astonishment,

36:16.723 --> 36:19.999
that the image that was formed
was her very own room.

36:20.083 --> 36:22.233
And the figure
in the centre of the puzzle,

36:22.323 --> 36:24.791
as she completed it,
was herself.

36:24.883 --> 36:28.762
<i>And with trembling hands,</i>
<i>she placed the last four pieces...</i>

36:28.843 --> 36:33.712
<i>and stared in horror at the face</i>
<i>of a demented madman at the window.</i>

36:33.803 --> 36:37.557
The last thing that
this old lady ever heard...

36:37.643 --> 36:40.282
- was the sound of breaking glass.
- No, she didn't.

36:40.363 --> 36:43.002
- [ Laughing, Chattering ]
- Yes, this is true. This is true.

36:43.083 --> 36:45.551
- I've got one that's better than that.
<i>- [ Charlie Laughs ]</i>

36:45.643 --> 36:47.873

36:47.963 --> 36:50.352
and they're driving through the forest
at night on a long trip.

36:50.443 --> 36:52.911
And they run out of gas,
and there's a madman on the--

36:53.003 --> 36:54.356
The thing with the hand?

<i>- [ All Chattering ]</i>

<i>- [ Charlie ] I told you that one.</i>
- You did not.

36:58.283 --> 37:00.274
