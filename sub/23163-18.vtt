00:01.585 --> 00:03.451
<i>Michael Doheny, Thomas Magnum.</i>

00:03.888 --> 00:05.617
Drop the gun on the floor!

00:06.624 --> 00:08.854
So far you run
a lousy investigation!

00:09.193 --> 00:12.162
That's all you got to say?
"We got off to a bad start"?

00:13.130 --> 00:14.188
Thomas!

00:14.265 --> 00:17.063
Wait a minute!
We just wanna talk to you!

00:17.301 --> 00:19.235
There was no runaway kid.
There never was.

00:19.904 --> 00:22.896
You got ten seconds to tell me
everything you know about Geiger.

00:24.809 --> 00:26.470
We'd better find Geiger
before he does.

00:26.544 --> 00:28.341
<i>I don't think Doheny
plans to take him back.</i>

01:54.198 --> 01:56.928
I didn't give him
my phone number. No way.

02:00.738 --> 02:02.865
<i>Laura, don't play
with the ball inside, okay?</i>

02:02.940 --> 02:04.567
Go watch TV or something.

02:04.642 --> 02:07.167
<i>So what about you
passing notes to Reza, huh?</i>

02:08.979 --> 02:12.006
That geek?
Get out of here!

02:13.451 --> 02:16.420
<i>What do you think I am,
a total moron?</i>

02:16.487 --> 02:18.921
I'd rather swap
spit with Godzilla.

02:19.824 --> 02:21.348
What was in the note?

02:22.660 --> 02:24.594
<i>Come on, you can tell me!</i>

02:25.629 --> 02:26.721
Oh!

02:26.998 --> 02:28.727
You're kidding!
I don't believe it!

02:28.799 --> 02:30.061
I never said that!

02:38.376 --> 02:42.676
<i>For 15 years people have been
telling me to get out of the Bronx.</i>

02:42.880 --> 02:46.441
<i>Telling me the old neighborhood
is going to the dogs.</i>

02:46.517 --> 02:48.417
<i>Well as far as I'm concerned,</i>

02:48.486 --> 02:51.978
<i>the whole kit and caboodle can
go to Hades in a handbasket!</i>

02:52.056 --> 02:55.150
<i>But it's my neighborhood,
and I'm here to stay.</i>

02:55.226 --> 02:57.023
You tell 'em!
Yeah!

03:03.067 --> 03:06.093
<i>There isn't a one of you here
wouldn't have left here long ago</i>

03:06.170 --> 03:07.694
<i>if it hadn't been for one man.</i>

03:07.772 --> 03:12.072
<i>A man who gave a damn for
more than 25 years of service.</i>

03:12.143 --> 03:13.838
<i>A man who set out every day</i>

03:13.911 --> 03:15.469
<i>to show the scum and the lowlife</i>

03:15.546 --> 03:17.741
<i>who would like to take over
this neighborhood</i>

03:17.815 --> 03:21.717
<i>that decent people had a right to
live in this neighborhood without fear.</i>

03:21.786 --> 03:23.117
Yeah!

03:23.554 --> 03:24.885
<i>Well,</i>

03:25.790 --> 03:29.590
<i>I can tell you that this
neighborhood's gonna be a lot emptier</i>

03:30.861 --> 03:33.955
<i>without Detective Sergeant
Michael Doheny.</i>

03:35.466 --> 03:39.960
Doheny! Doheny! Doheny!

03:40.037 --> 03:41.732
<i>All right, all right.</i>

03:41.806 --> 03:43.364
<i>All right!</i>

03:44.075 --> 03:45.269
<i>I love him, too.</i>

03:45.576 --> 03:49.910
<i>So here he is, Detective
Sergeant Michael Doheny.</i>

03:55.352 --> 03:56.979
<i>Give 'em hell, Dad.
I will.</i>

04:02.993 --> 04:04.153
<i>Dad, what is it?</i>

04:04.228 --> 04:06.059
Nothing at all.
Do I get the first dance?

04:06.931 --> 04:08.023
You bet.

04:19.844 --> 04:21.744
<i>You were a great
partner, my boy.</i>

04:24.515 --> 04:27.882
<i>And if I had known that something
as sweet and as nice as this</i>

04:27.952 --> 04:29.044
<i>was gonna happen tonight,</i>

04:29.120 --> 04:31.315
<i>I would've retired
a long time ago.</i>

04:33.390 --> 04:35.290
<i>I wanna be serious
for a second to tell you</i>

04:35.359 --> 04:38.886
<i>how delighted I am,
and how honored...</i>

04:44.068 --> 04:45.057
<i>I am</i>

04:46.303 --> 04:49.932
<i>that this evening was put
together in my honor, my behalf.</i>

04:52.209 --> 04:54.439
<i>And I thank you for
your presence tonight,</i>

04:54.512 --> 04:57.140
<i>I thank you for your love
and for your affection,</i>

04:57.781 --> 05:01.342
<i>and I wish you all
the merriest of Christmases,</i>

05:01.719 --> 05:03.653
<i>a lot of warmth in your homes,</i>

05:03.988 --> 05:05.683
<i>and my daughter and myself</i>

05:06.824 --> 05:09.850
<i>wish you the best of New Years</i>

05:09.927 --> 05:12.418
<i>and good health,
and God bless you all.</i>

05:21.739 --> 05:25.573
<i>This is with great love
and admiration</i>

05:25.643 --> 05:27.838
<i>from the men and women
of the 41st.</i>

05:28.846 --> 05:30.040
Aw!

06:28.439 --> 06:30.703
Don't move.
I'm on my way. Here I come.

06:33.510 --> 06:34.977
Hi. It's me again.

06:37.248 --> 06:40.615
<i>Well. One thing about being
a Private Investigator is,</i>

06:40.684 --> 06:43.312
you can't really go out
and look for work.

06:43.387 --> 06:45.855
You have to wait for
the client to come to you.

06:45.923 --> 06:47.049
<i>Hey, Thomas?</i>

06:47.124 --> 06:49.718
Rick! You just ruined my tape!

06:49.793 --> 06:52.887
<i>Gee, I'm sorry. I didn't think
you'd be doing anything important.</i>

06:53.264 --> 06:55.027
What is that? Some kind
of case you're working on?

06:55.099 --> 06:57.033
<i>In a way. Well, put it away, buddy boy.</i>

06:57.101 --> 06:58.898
Because I got something
really hot for you.

06:58.969 --> 07:01.335
<i>You're gonna thank me for
this, Thomas. I got you a job.</i>

07:01.405 --> 07:02.565
A job?

07:02.906 --> 07:04.066
As in "employment."

07:04.141 --> 07:06.939
You're offering me a job? I'm
offering you a piece of cake.

07:07.745 --> 07:09.178
Oh! Really?

07:09.246 --> 07:11.441
<i>Well, I'm kind of
involved in this project.</i>

07:11.515 --> 07:13.346
<i>I'm behind schedule,
so thanks anyway.</i>

07:13.417 --> 07:16.011
We're only talking
two days' work.

07:17.788 --> 07:19.187
Hi! It's me again.

07:19.256 --> 07:21.190
<i>Forget this project, Thomas,
Hey, turn on...</i>

07:21.258 --> 07:23.624
<i>unless you wanna blow $10,000. $10,000?</i>

07:23.694 --> 07:25.093
Cash!
Turn off the tape.

07:25.896 --> 07:27.693
<i>I told you you'd thank me, Thomas.</i>

07:27.765 --> 07:29.699
<i>Hey, Thomas, you don't
have a tape in there.</i>

07:29.767 --> 07:30.756
What?

07:34.171 --> 07:35.297
What kind of legitimate job

07:35.372 --> 07:37.499
<i>pays $10,000 for two days' work?</i>

07:37.574 --> 07:38.802
A missing person.

07:40.611 --> 07:41.600
No.

07:41.712 --> 07:42.701
<i>No, no.</i>

07:42.813 --> 07:43.837
No.

07:43.914 --> 07:47.077
Missing persons is the
worst kind of case there is.

07:47.151 --> 07:49.642
You spend years
and thousands of dollars

07:49.720 --> 07:51.415
trying to track somebody down

07:51.488 --> 07:53.217
who probably doesn't
wanna be found.

07:53.290 --> 07:55.224
<i>No. Thanks anyway,
but no thanks.</i>

07:55.292 --> 07:57.157
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it!

07:57.227 --> 07:58.626
This guy comes into my club

07:58.696 --> 08:00.721
<i>wanting to know who the
best P.I. In the Islands is,</i>

08:00.798 --> 08:02.163
I do a whole
song-and-dance number

08:02.232 --> 08:03.358
<i>convincing him
that you're the guy,</i>

08:03.434 --> 08:06.301
<i>'cause I happen to know
that you could use $10,000.</i>

08:06.370 --> 08:10.033
This is the thanks I get? You don't
wanna follow up one crummy lead?

08:10.107 --> 08:11.131
One lead?

08:11.208 --> 08:12.641
I knew you'd come
to your senses.

08:12.710 --> 08:14.905
We gotta be at the Waikiki
Royale Hotel for 12:30...

08:14.978 --> 08:17.446
I'm not gonna drop everything
just to do this thing.

08:17.514 --> 08:19.243
We could still make it
if I drive.

08:19.316 --> 08:20.305
Rick.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.379
What exactly are you
getting out of this?

08:25.656 --> 08:27.624
Just a real small finder's fee.

08:29.326 --> 08:30.759
And the good feeling inside

08:30.828 --> 08:32.294
when I know that I
helped out a pal.

08:38.168 --> 08:41.001
<i>The missing person's name
is Kenneth Geiger,</i>

08:41.071 --> 08:44.404
<i>5'10 ", 5'11", light complexion,</i>

08:44.475 --> 08:45.999
no identifying marks.

08:46.076 --> 08:47.202
<i>Rick, try to relax.</i>

08:47.277 --> 08:49.268
Try to be a little more natural.

08:49.513 --> 08:52.380
<i>You try and drive, looking
in a camera and talk,</i>

08:52.449 --> 08:53.939
<i>and be natural,
all at the same time.</i>

08:54.017 --> 08:57.453
<i>Okay, I'll fill it in
with narration later.</i>

08:57.521 --> 08:59.546
<i>Yeah. What's that
documentary for, anyway?</i>

08:59.623 --> 09:02.592
<i>It's just a little film I said
I'd do. It's nothing, really.</i>

09:02.860 --> 09:04.327
<i>Can't talk about it, huh?</i>

09:06.163 --> 09:09.530
The missing kid's name is
Kenneth Geiger. What else?

09:09.867 --> 09:11.129
Well I didn't get
all the details

09:11.201 --> 09:13.999
except that he's a rich kid
who stole the family jewels

09:14.071 --> 09:16.631
and ran off with a buddy
of his by the name of Dusty.

09:16.707 --> 09:18.732
Hi.
Something or another.

09:18.809 --> 09:21.243
<i>Well, naturally
they want the kid back.</i>

09:21.945 --> 09:23.310
Or the jewels.

09:23.380 --> 09:24.938
<i>Thomas, you're getting cynical.</i>

09:25.015 --> 09:26.915
It comes from not having a full-time job.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.815
<i>Okay, they want the kid.</i>

09:28.886 --> 09:31.480
<i>Anyway, the P.I.
That the family hired</i>

09:31.555 --> 09:34.023
<i>followed the kids all the
way back here to Honolulu,</i>

09:34.091 --> 09:35.922
then he lost the trail.

09:35.993 --> 09:38.291
That's where you and I come in.

09:39.363 --> 09:40.830
<i>Thomas, are you listening to me?</i>

09:40.898 --> 09:43.526
<i>Uh, yeah. The trail
got cold in Honolulu.</i>

09:43.600 --> 09:45.329
What's that got to do with us?

09:46.470 --> 09:47.994
<i>This Kenneth Geiger,</i>

09:48.071 --> 09:51.165
he worked for us briefly at the
King Kamehameha Club as a lifeguard.

09:51.241 --> 09:52.435
Yeah?

09:52.509 --> 09:54.500
<i>Well, he quit
a couple of weeks ago.</i>

09:54.578 --> 09:56.842
<i>I made a few calls
to a couple of hotels,</i>

09:56.914 --> 09:59.610
and I found out
that he's working at...

09:59.683 --> 10:01.048
<i>Oh, the Waikiki Royale.</i>

10:01.118 --> 10:03.484
<i>All we gotta do
is pick the kid up,</i>

10:03.554 --> 10:06.114
<i>deliver him to the P. I.,
and collect the money.</i>

10:07.324 --> 10:09.485
<i>Like I said,
it's a piece of cake.</i>

10:09.560 --> 10:10.549
Right.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.695
I talked to the guy who
hires all the poolside help.

10:18.769 --> 10:20.930
I told him that we had to
ask him a couple of questions.

10:21.004 --> 10:22.301
Why didn't you
just give his name

10:22.372 --> 10:24.704
to the private investigator
who's looking for Geiger?

10:24.775 --> 10:26.504
Oh yeah? And have him walk
away with all the money?

10:26.577 --> 10:27.601
No way!
Excuse me.

10:27.678 --> 10:29.407
<i>Give me this camera,
I'll put it in the trunk.</i>

10:29.480 --> 10:31.971
<i>No, no, come on. Let's get
this over with. Come on.</i>

10:52.569 --> 10:53.558
Thanks.

10:56.173 --> 10:58.141
<i>Well, would you ask him to...</i>

10:58.208 --> 10:59.641
Wait a minute.
Just tell him...

10:59.710 --> 11:03.077
<i>Tell him I need him to come
to work at 4:00 today, okay?</i>

11:03.146 --> 11:05.205
<i>Okay, thanks.
Willie Clayton?</i>

11:05.282 --> 11:06.579
Huh?

11:06.783 --> 11:08.751
I'm Thomas Magnum. I believe
we had an appointment?

11:08.819 --> 11:11.151
<i>Yeah, at 12:30?
I called you on the phone.</i>

11:11.788 --> 11:15.053
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, you're the,
uh... Rick Wright, his associate.</i>

11:15.125 --> 11:16.217
<i>The P. I., right!</i>

11:16.293 --> 11:17.920
That's Private Investigator.
Sit down.

11:17.995 --> 11:19.690
<i>Drink?
No, thanks.</i>

11:19.763 --> 11:22.288
<i>Smitty, bring a round of...</i>

11:22.366 --> 11:24.425
<i>What'll it be, boys?
I guess I'll have a beer.</i>

11:24.501 --> 11:26.628
Old Dusseldorf in a longneck.

11:26.703 --> 11:28.864
<i>Yeah, yeah. Beers!
Beers all around, okay?</i>

11:31.074 --> 11:34.601
<i>Well, what can I do
for you boys?</i>

11:35.078 --> 11:36.739
<i>We're looking for a young man,</i>

11:36.813 --> 11:38.337
<i>we think he might be
working for you,</i>

11:38.415 --> 11:39.882
his name is Kenneth Geiger.

11:43.554 --> 11:44.851
<i>Dick Shusha, the new manager,</i>

11:44.955 --> 11:46.513
<i>he put you up to this,
didn't he?</i>

11:46.590 --> 11:48.387
We're not up to anything!

11:49.593 --> 11:51.026
You filming this?

11:51.094 --> 11:53.153
<i>No, no, take it easy.
Listen, I got nothing to hide.</i>

11:53.230 --> 11:55.425
I will tell that
to Shusha myself.

11:55.499 --> 11:57.490
We're not trying to film
anything. We're just...

11:57.568 --> 11:58.728
<i>Okay, all right,
all right, look.</i>

11:58.802 --> 12:00.963
How much will it take
to convince you

12:01.038 --> 12:02.630
<i>to give Shusha
a good report on me, huh?</i>

12:04.241 --> 12:05.868
<i>You'll take my IOU, won't you?</i>

12:05.943 --> 12:08.537
We're not working for
anybody named Shusha.

12:13.350 --> 12:15.409
You're really just
looking for Geiger?

12:16.019 --> 12:17.008
You know him?

12:20.357 --> 12:22.587
<i>Hey, do I owe
you boys an apology!</i>

12:24.361 --> 12:25.521
Clayton.

12:25.862 --> 12:28.490
Do you know Kenneth Geiger?

12:30.901 --> 12:32.869
<i>Uh, Geiger, Geiger...</i>

12:35.272 --> 12:37.740
<i>Yeah, I...
I might. I might.</i>

12:38.442 --> 12:39.431
You might.

12:41.411 --> 12:44.847
<i>Well, if it's, you know,
real important to you.</i>

12:56.994 --> 13:00.122
He's supposed to
call in tomorrow.

13:00.197 --> 13:03.394
<i>I'll find out where he is and
I'll give you guys a buzz, okay?</i>

13:03.467 --> 13:04.900
What...

13:05.068 --> 13:08.265
You got ten seconds to tell me
everything you know about Geiger

13:08.338 --> 13:09.737
or you'll no longer have a neck.

13:09.806 --> 13:11.205
<i>Oh, no!</i>

13:11.475 --> 13:12.533
You know him?

13:12.943 --> 13:14.001
Hey! Come here!

13:18.348 --> 13:19.645
My camera!

13:20.117 --> 13:22.017
He's the P.I.
That hired you!

13:23.153 --> 13:24.211
You work for that guy?

13:24.287 --> 13:25.413
No! Wait.

13:34.665 --> 13:36.599
Where is Kenneth Geiger?

13:36.667 --> 13:39.158
He's living at the Kalakaua Towers. Honest!

13:39.236 --> 13:40.965
<i>Okay, let's grab a car.</i>

13:45.609 --> 13:46.803
<i>Hey, Doheny.</i>

13:49.613 --> 13:51.877
<i>Michael Doheny, Thomas Magnum.</i>

13:53.083 --> 13:54.277
Nobody move!

13:54.851 --> 13:56.512
Drop the gun on the floor!

13:56.586 --> 13:59.487
<i>Can you take a little
constructive criticism, Mr. Magnum?</i>

13:59.556 --> 14:01.820
Drop the gun on the floor!

14:03.994 --> 14:06.087
So far you run
a lousy investigation!

14:12.391 --> 14:15.019
<i>All right,
so we got off to a bad start.</i>

14:15.387 --> 14:16.615
That's all you got to say?

14:16.688 --> 14:18.212
"We got off to a bad start"?

14:18.290 --> 14:20.554
Anybody can make a mistake!

14:20.626 --> 14:22.719
<i>No, no, you didn't
make a mistake.</i>

14:23.262 --> 14:25.230
You tailed us there on purpose,

14:25.297 --> 14:26.855
you started a fight on purpose,

14:26.932 --> 14:28.194
you pulled a gun on purpose.

14:28.267 --> 14:31.134
I wouldn't be surprised if you
got us thrown into jail on purpose.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.137
You didn't make
one single mistake.

14:33.605 --> 14:35.038
I'm talking about you.

14:35.407 --> 14:37.034
<i>Me?
Yeah, you!</i>

14:37.109 --> 14:38.838
<i>I mean, there you were,
running around,</i>

14:38.910 --> 14:41.003
<i>not knowing exactly what to do,</i>

14:41.980 --> 14:46.576
<i>meanwhile, Clayton is giving you a double
drop job and you didn't even see it.</i>

14:46.818 --> 14:48.979
I saw it!
What's a double drop?

14:51.857 --> 14:53.552
You never heard
of a double drop?

14:53.959 --> 14:55.051
Uh-uh.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.664
<i>You pay Clayton
to give you information,</i>

15:00.732 --> 15:02.427
and then Geiger pays him

15:02.501 --> 15:04.332
not to give you the information.

15:04.770 --> 15:05.759
Got it?

15:06.638 --> 15:07.627
Exactly.

15:08.006 --> 15:09.598
And you knew
that he was doing that?

15:09.875 --> 15:11.001
Double drop!

15:11.810 --> 15:14.643
<i>Well, like I always say,
anybody can make a mistake.</i>

15:15.947 --> 15:17.505
At least I got the address.

15:17.582 --> 15:19.072
<i>Well, that's probably a phony!</i>

15:19.151 --> 15:21.415
<i>Yeah, but it's a place
to start, isn't it?</i>

15:22.454 --> 15:24.547
<i>And if you wanna
go on with this thing,</i>

15:25.223 --> 15:28.454
<i>think I should mention that you
could come up with a $20,000 reward</i>

15:28.527 --> 15:29.721
if we find the boy.

15:30.295 --> 15:31.785
We do wanna go on.

15:32.831 --> 15:34.594
<i>$20,000 reward?</i>

15:34.800 --> 15:37.769
<i>Look, I told you that I was gonna
get a small finder's fee. I mean...</i>

15:38.270 --> 15:40.397
<i>All right, you take 15,
I'll take five.</i>

15:40.472 --> 15:42.303
<i>After all,
you are the professional.</i>

15:44.209 --> 15:46.473
You got the address.
What do you need us for?

15:52.517 --> 15:54.178
You got any children
of your own?

15:58.156 --> 16:00.647
<i>If you did, you'd know what
it means to wake up one morning</i>

16:00.726 --> 16:02.353
and find that
one of them disappeared.

16:04.162 --> 16:05.356
I think I do.

16:07.733 --> 16:10.031
Kenneth Geiger's parents
are friends of mine.

16:10.936 --> 16:13.200
And they sent me over here
to find their son.

16:14.339 --> 16:17.206
I find myself in kind of a
strange neighborhood for me.

16:18.410 --> 16:21.743
<i>So Junior, here, told me that
you're pretty good in what you do.</i>

16:21.813 --> 16:23.246
<i>Oh, he usually is.</i>

16:23.315 --> 16:26.876
<i>Oh, I checked it out. He's better
than "pretty good." He's damn good.</i>

16:28.086 --> 16:29.917
<i>Well, that's nice to hear.</i>

16:32.190 --> 16:34.522
I'd appreciate it a great deal

16:34.593 --> 16:36.527
if you would help me
find this boy.

16:38.530 --> 16:41.124
<i>If you will,
you'd make me very happy.</i>

16:41.199 --> 16:43.531
<i>If you don't want to,
okay, I understand that.</i>

16:46.638 --> 16:48.606
<i>Sorry for the mix-up, guys.</i>

16:49.608 --> 16:52.076
<i>Oh! Hey, that's okay,
Lieutenant. It happens.</i>

16:52.144 --> 16:53.839
I wasn't talking to you.

16:55.247 --> 16:56.509
<i>Listen, my...</i>

16:58.350 --> 17:00.079
My men were real
embarrassed to find out

17:00.152 --> 17:02.120
that they had arrested
a New York cop...

17:02.187 --> 17:03.677
<i>No, a retired cop.</i>

17:03.755 --> 17:04.949
<i>Well, even so.</i>

17:05.022 --> 17:06.957
<i>I took care of all the papers for your, uh,</i>

17:07.826 --> 17:08.815
gun permit.

17:08.960 --> 17:11.929
<i>Lieutenant, I don't want
anything special done for me.</i>

17:11.997 --> 17:14.295
My pleasure. But I thank
you for it. Thank you.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.867
Excuse us.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.060
Thank you.

17:22.674 --> 17:25.369
<i>Well, I guess you and Doheny
can take it from here.</i>

17:25.444 --> 17:27.969
<i>I'll get the camera fixed as soon
as I get it out of the shop, Thomas.</i>

17:28.046 --> 17:29.980
<i>You're gonna thank me
for this, eventually.</i>

17:30.449 --> 17:31.438
I hope.

17:43.695 --> 17:46.095
<i>I know what you're
thinking, and you're right.</i>

17:46.164 --> 17:49.463
<i>I couldn't think of one good
reason for me to stay on this case.</i>

17:49.534 --> 17:51.434
<i>I mean, besides the money,
of course.</i>

17:51.503 --> 17:53.198
<i>Which was considerable.</i>

17:53.271 --> 17:56.468
<i>But even so, there had to be
something more than money.</i>

17:56.541 --> 18:00.443
<i>And that something was retired
detective Michael Doheny.</i>

18:00.812 --> 18:05.112
<i>Is spite of the mix-up, there was
something intriguing about him.</i>

18:05.717 --> 18:08.049
I'm gonna give you
a piece of advice for free.

18:08.119 --> 18:10.053
<i>When you're dealing
with an informant,</i>

18:10.121 --> 18:12.521
you gotta let him know you
mean business. You got it?

18:14.292 --> 18:16.624
<i>If you're talking about
the guy you pulled a gun on,</i>

18:16.695 --> 18:18.219
he isn't an informant.

18:18.296 --> 18:20.764
He is an informant.
You just didn't recognize it.

18:20.832 --> 18:23.392
<i>You stick with me, and you'll learn
something about that kind of stuff.</i>

18:23.468 --> 18:25.060
<i>Look, he would've
told you anything</i>

18:25.203 --> 18:27.967
to get you to take your gun out of his ribs.

18:28.039 --> 18:29.939
The gun gets him
to tell the truth.

18:30.008 --> 18:32.806
And they haven't got time
to think up a lie.

18:33.712 --> 18:35.942
Aha! 1207. See?

18:41.019 --> 18:42.316
Thomas!

18:42.387 --> 18:44.787
Wait a minute!
We just wanna talk to you!

18:51.630 --> 18:53.188
Head him off!
Yeah!

19:30.869 --> 19:34.270
Looks like I won't be able to keep
my promise to his parents after all.

19:52.624 --> 19:54.251
<i>Not now, Higgins.</i>

19:55.093 --> 19:58.187
<i>Hey, sorry I took so long.</i>

19:58.263 --> 20:00.754
But I just got Rick's message
an hour ago.

20:01.433 --> 20:04.664
I had some important paperwork to
finish up before I could come over.

20:04.736 --> 20:05.725
What message?

20:05.804 --> 20:08.830
<i>Well, he said that you broke
Robin Masters' video camera</i>

20:08.907 --> 20:11.933
and that you needed a loaner right
away for some important documentary.

20:12.010 --> 20:13.170
Oh!

20:13.244 --> 20:14.233
Check.

20:15.747 --> 20:18.375
Oh. He said it had to do with your work.

20:18.917 --> 20:20.976
<i>Yeah, that's right, it does.</i>

20:21.052 --> 20:23.953
<i>Well, then feel free
to use mine.</i>

20:24.889 --> 20:26.186
<i>Well, thanks, T.C.</i>

20:26.257 --> 20:28.657
<i>Hey, what are friends for?</i>

20:32.230 --> 20:35.256
How many people do you think
will see this documentary?

20:35.333 --> 20:37.767
I don't know. I haven't
really thought about it.

20:37.836 --> 20:39.599
Artistic content is important.

20:39.671 --> 20:41.832
Any commercial value
will have to come second.

20:41.906 --> 20:43.271
Commercial value?

20:43.341 --> 20:47.471
<i>Well, I thought that usually, when
you wanna get someplace on the Island,</i>

20:47.545 --> 20:49.877
you rely on T.C.'s
Island Hoppers.

20:49.948 --> 20:54.681
So I assumed that you might want
a shot or two of the helicopter.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.153
<i>Well that is
a good idea, T.C.</i>

20:58.023 --> 21:02.585
Great! There are some things
about this camera you need to know.

21:02.661 --> 21:07.325
<i>Now this is
the auto-focuslmanual button.</i>

21:07.399 --> 21:09.060
Always check with this
before you start.

21:09.134 --> 21:10.761
<i>You know, there's one thing
I can't figure out...</i>

21:10.835 --> 21:13.030
<i>Oh, there's not much to figure
with this camera.</i>

21:13.104 --> 21:15.231
Back light. High light.
Zoom lens.

21:15.306 --> 21:17.399
A rich kid runs away from home

21:17.509 --> 21:19.409
and hangs out in Hawaii
for three months.

21:19.477 --> 21:22.241
What's the worst thing that can
happen if he's caught and sent home?

21:22.313 --> 21:23.803
Is this part of the documentary?

21:23.882 --> 21:27.147
<i>I mean, his parents aren't gonna put him
in jail for stealing the family jewelry,</i>

21:27.218 --> 21:28.480
and he didn't look that young.

21:28.553 --> 21:29.850
<i>So if he's not a minor,</i>

21:29.921 --> 21:31.912
<i>I don't think they can legally
force him to go back anyway,</i>

21:31.990 --> 21:33.287
not if he doesn't wanna go.

21:34.359 --> 21:35.417
Then there's no problem.

21:35.493 --> 21:36.858
<i>Well, that's what
I was thinking.</i>

21:36.928 --> 21:38.793
So why would he risk his life
running out in traffic

21:38.863 --> 21:40.592
rather than talk to Doheny?

21:40.665 --> 21:42.792
Who's Doheny?
And why didn't he have a tan?

21:42.867 --> 21:44.926
Doheny?
Kenneth Geiger.

21:45.003 --> 21:47.301
He's been working as a
life guard for three months.

21:47.372 --> 21:49.397
How can you do that
and not have a tan?

21:51.743 --> 21:53.438
You've been reading
too many detective novels!

21:54.312 --> 21:55.404
Yeah?

21:55.880 --> 21:57.438
<i>Maybe you're right, T.C.</i>

22:07.425 --> 22:08.949
<i>Lieutenant Page, please.
Thomas Magnum.</i>

22:09.861 --> 22:11.158
Lieutenant?

22:14.966 --> 22:16.126
Thank you.

22:16.201 --> 22:17.828
<i>Page here.
It's Magnum.</i>

22:17.902 --> 22:20.735
Magnum! You just
saved me a call.

22:20.805 --> 22:21.829
Is Doheny with you?

22:21.906 --> 22:24.431
No. Did you get an ID
on the body we brought over?

22:24.509 --> 22:25.999
<i>Sure did.
Was it Geiger?</i>

22:26.311 --> 22:27.573
No.

22:27.645 --> 22:29.840
The deceased's name
was Dustin Murray.

22:29.914 --> 22:32.246
<i>Now you would think
a smart New York cop</i>

22:32.317 --> 22:36.151
like Doheny would know that
this wasn't the guy he was after.

22:36.621 --> 22:37.815
<i>Yeah, you'd think so.</i>

22:37.889 --> 22:39.550
<i>Or a smart P.I. Like you</i>

22:40.024 --> 22:41.855
would tell me what he knows
about this.

22:43.328 --> 22:45.626
<i>I'm not hearing anything.</i>

22:47.966 --> 22:48.955
Checkmate.

22:50.235 --> 22:51.497
<i>So where's Doheny?</i>

22:52.670 --> 22:54.228
<i>Magnum! Where's Doheny?</i>

23:08.119 --> 23:10.053
<i>Sorry to disappoint you, Doheny.</i>

23:10.655 --> 23:11.883
It's only me.

23:18.255 --> 23:19.545
<i>Well, as long as you're in,</i>

23:19.613 --> 23:21.274
why don't you shut the door?

23:27.670 --> 23:31.265
I assume that you know that I'm not
trying to cut you out of any reward money.

23:31.341 --> 23:32.808
There's no reward money.

23:33.710 --> 23:36.474
I had an interesting
conversation with Lieutenant Page.

23:36.546 --> 23:38.912
It turns out the young man
we chased into the street

23:38.982 --> 23:40.779
wasn't Kenneth Geiger after all.

23:41.117 --> 23:42.607
<i>But then you knew that,
didn't you?</i>

23:42.685 --> 23:45.119
Being such a close friend
of the family and all.

23:46.422 --> 23:47.480
What do you want?

23:47.557 --> 23:49.889
What do I want?
I want the truth!

23:51.127 --> 23:52.754
<i>Well, there's truth
and there's truth.</i>

23:52.829 --> 23:53.818
Don't give me that!

23:53.930 --> 23:56.023
There was no runaway kid.
There never was.

23:56.099 --> 23:59.591
<i>What there is, is an unsolved homicide
in Detective Doheny's district.</i>

23:59.669 --> 24:00.795
<i>Oh, probably more than one.</i>

24:00.870 --> 24:03.031
A homicide committed
by two young men.

24:03.106 --> 24:06.633
<i>Kenneth Geiger and Dustin
Murray, according to NYPD.</i>

24:06.709 --> 24:09.109
I figure that leaves us
with a homicide detective

24:09.178 --> 24:12.045
with a murder case he couldn't
solve before he was forced to retire.

24:12.115 --> 24:13.639
How am I doing so far?

24:15.785 --> 24:17.116
You're getting better.

24:18.655 --> 24:21.419
<i>You just couldn't stand to
let one get away, could you?</i>

24:30.300 --> 24:31.699
You know what I think?

24:33.436 --> 24:35.870
I think you should take a
good look at this photograph

24:35.939 --> 24:38.203
of the little girl they killed.

24:51.621 --> 24:52.883
<i>They raped her,</i>

24:53.590 --> 24:55.353
<i>they beat her to a pulp,</i>

24:56.593 --> 24:58.356
and they tossed her
into an alley

24:58.595 --> 25:00.187
and left her there to die.

25:09.205 --> 25:10.729
You could have told me.

25:11.574 --> 25:13.542
Twenty-twenty
hindsight.

25:20.950 --> 25:23.418
<i>You know, if Geiger
hasn't shown up by now,</i>

25:23.486 --> 25:24.612
he may not be coming back.

25:24.687 --> 25:26.951
<i>Oh, no, no, no.
He'll be back.</i>

25:28.057 --> 25:29.786
You can make a bet on it.

25:31.494 --> 25:33.621
Because he ain't going nowhere

25:33.696 --> 25:34.993
without this stuff.

25:37.834 --> 25:39.131
<i>Passport,</i>

25:39.469 --> 25:40.458
<i>check book,</i>

25:40.570 --> 25:42.128
Some cash...

25:49.746 --> 25:51.304
<i>Oh, no, not you again!</i>

25:51.381 --> 25:53.110
<i>Hey, listen, I didn't do anything, all right?</i>

25:53.182 --> 25:55.116
Just let me out of here.

25:56.586 --> 25:58.247
Okay! Now what're you
gonna do?

25:58.321 --> 25:59.811
What're you gonna do?

25:59.889 --> 26:02.016
Where is Kenneth Geiger?

26:03.159 --> 26:04.649
I think you better tell him.

26:05.628 --> 26:07.823
I thought it might be...
Where is Kenneth Geiger?

26:07.897 --> 26:11.060
I thought it might be worth some money to
let him know you guys were looking for him!

26:11.134 --> 26:13.261
So he gave me $500...
Where is Kenneth Geiger?

26:13.336 --> 26:16.237
The banyan tree. International
Marketplace. 9:00.

28:27.203 --> 28:29.137
<i>Oh!
Oh, my goodness!</i>

28:29.205 --> 28:31.230
<i>Oh, dear, how clumsy of me.</i>

28:51.027 --> 28:52.619
Hey! My bike!

29:05.708 --> 29:08.176
<i>I guess this means we
won't be getting the 20,000.</i>

29:08.244 --> 29:09.711
Not that I care myself.

29:10.046 --> 29:11.673
But I was really
thinking about you.

29:11.747 --> 29:14.045
<i>According to Lieutenant
Page, Geiger has a habit.</i>

29:14.116 --> 29:15.549
Somebody's been selling to him.

29:15.618 --> 29:17.950
I was thinking somebody
knows where he is.

29:18.020 --> 29:21.012
<i>Yeah, it's possible, I guess. But you
gotta figure out where the dealer is.</i>

29:21.090 --> 29:23.217
<i>Well, I was thinking
maybe you could do that.</i>

29:23.292 --> 29:24.782
Me? How am I gonna
figure that out?

29:24.861 --> 29:27.386
<i>You make a few phone calls,
you ask a few questions.</i>

29:27.463 --> 29:29.624
<i>You did get me into this
in the first place, you know.</i>

29:29.699 --> 29:32.259
Okay! I've got this
all figured out.

29:33.402 --> 29:35.802
Tomorrow I've got a tour
of the Islands lined up.

29:35.872 --> 29:38.568
You can get some shots of me
taking off and landing.

29:38.641 --> 29:42.042
<i>Oh, and Thursday
I've got a cargo run.</i>

29:42.111 --> 29:44.545
<i>You can go along, and
maybe get some aerial shots.</i>

29:44.614 --> 29:46.206
That should give it some class.

29:46.282 --> 29:49.945
<i>And then a week from Tuesday, I'm getting
a commendation from the Tourist Board.</i>

29:50.019 --> 29:51.714
Wouldn't hurt to get
a couple of shots of that...

29:51.787 --> 29:53.880
<i>T. C., what are you
talking about?</i>

29:53.956 --> 29:55.184
The documentary?

29:55.258 --> 29:57.249
<i>T. C., the documentary's
gonna have to wait.</i>

29:57.326 --> 29:58.884
Something's come up.
It's important.

30:00.062 --> 30:01.154
Oh.

30:01.230 --> 30:02.288
<i>Well,</i>

30:03.633 --> 30:06.534
maybe I can cancel the tour
and the cargo run.

30:07.270 --> 30:08.828
<i>Well, postpone it, anyway.</i>

30:08.905 --> 30:09.894
Thanks.

30:11.974 --> 30:13.999
You think you can do that
for me? What are you gonna do?

30:14.076 --> 30:17.477
Go see Lieutenant Page. There's still
something about this case that's bothering me.

30:17.546 --> 30:19.776
Where's Doheny? Where I
can keep an eye on him!

30:20.950 --> 30:24.716
<i>Just outside Moscow,
in the dead of winter.</i>

30:24.787 --> 30:28.917
Lieutenant Baneworthy and I had been
sent to Russia on a fact-finding mission.

30:28.991 --> 30:31.983
<i>Well, you can imagine two young
men sent off to an exotic locale</i>

30:32.061 --> 30:33.722
<i>for the first time
in their lives,</i>

30:33.796 --> 30:35.787
especially a place as romantic

30:35.932 --> 30:37.661
as the homeland
of Fyodor Dostoyevsky

30:37.733 --> 30:39.792
and Peter llich Tchaikovsky.

30:42.104 --> 30:45.198
I'm not a very good listener
tonight. I guess I'm tired.

30:45.775 --> 30:47.333
I suppose I should turn in.

30:47.944 --> 30:49.241
Of course.

30:49.712 --> 30:52.806
But I think you'll find
this quite interesting.

30:52.882 --> 30:56.010
I shall never forget
one Russian infantryman

30:56.085 --> 30:58.076
I saw returning from the front.

30:58.154 --> 31:00.247
<i>A young man who had
survived ferocious fighting,</i>

31:00.323 --> 31:03.224
only to find that his wife and infant son

31:03.559 --> 31:05.652
had died of starvation
in his absence.

31:06.529 --> 31:10.090
He started beating his fist
against a brick wall.

31:10.166 --> 31:12.930
Over and over and over.

31:13.669 --> 31:17.196
Until every bone
in his hand was crushed.

31:20.376 --> 31:24.369
It almost seemed that some
primal force in him believed

31:24.447 --> 31:27.211
<i>that if he could break
through that brick wall,</i>

31:27.283 --> 31:30.878
he could undo what war and
nature had done to his family.

31:31.787 --> 31:34.915
<i>Of course, he only succeeded
in destroying his hand.</i>

31:36.392 --> 31:38.792
It was the only thing
he could do.

31:39.795 --> 31:41.456
Yes. I see your point.

31:43.332 --> 31:46.529
<i>Well, I think you'll be
quite comfortable here.</i>

31:46.602 --> 31:47.796
<i>Oh, I'm sure.</i>

31:49.338 --> 31:51.238
And I thank you for your help.

31:52.241 --> 31:53.572
Good night.
Night.

32:04.987 --> 32:06.454
Why should I give you anything?

32:06.522 --> 32:08.547
Because you need me
as much as I need you.

32:08.624 --> 32:11.923
Oh! And suppose
for one moment that's true.

32:11.994 --> 32:13.586
What is it that you can give me?

32:13.662 --> 32:15.653
<i>Come on, Page.
What've you got to lose?</i>

32:19.335 --> 32:22.702
<i>Okay, I got a police report,
41st Precinct, NYPD.</i>

32:22.772 --> 32:24.865
There was an arrest on Geiger.

32:24.940 --> 32:27.875
<i>His parents put up the bail, and
him and his pal Murray skipped town.</i>

32:27.943 --> 32:29.342
Where's the report?

32:29.812 --> 32:31.507
You know better than that!

32:32.782 --> 32:36.081
<i>Look, Lieutenant, I don't know
exactly what I'm looking for</i>

32:36.152 --> 32:39.417
<i>but I tell you what, if I don't
find it, I'll get out of your way.</i>

32:41.724 --> 32:43.555
I'm gotta go for coffee.

32:43.626 --> 32:45.685
<i>Naturally, I'm gonna
have to ask you</i>

32:45.761 --> 32:49.094
not to look at the official
police report while I'm gone.

32:49.165 --> 32:50.860
You understand?

32:51.033 --> 32:52.022
Naturally.

33:38.180 --> 33:42.640
<i>The $20,000 reward is from
Doheny's retirement fund.</i>

33:42.718 --> 33:44.413
Yeah?
Look at this.

33:44.487 --> 33:47.684
I read it. The girl's mother went
to the hospital after the murder.

33:47.756 --> 33:48.882
Understandable.

33:48.958 --> 33:50.516
Look at her name.

33:51.393 --> 33:53.327
"Marion D. O'Hara."

33:53.395 --> 33:54.953
Look at her maiden name.

33:55.965 --> 33:57.193
Marion...

33:57.967 --> 33:59.400
Doheny O'Hara.

33:59.768 --> 34:01.668
The little girl? Laura?

34:01.737 --> 34:03.534
She was Doheny's granddaughter?

34:32.933 --> 34:34.038
Robin Masters' estate.

34:34.368 --> 34:36.199
<i>Higgins, I need
to talk to Doheny.</i>

34:36.570 --> 34:38.003
Have you any idea
what time it is?

34:38.071 --> 34:40.437
I'm quite certain he has
retired for the evening.

34:40.507 --> 34:41.496
It's important!

34:42.842 --> 34:43.867
Very well.

34:43.944 --> 34:48.040
<i>But while I have you on the line,
don't forget that tomorrow is trash day.</i>

34:56.757 --> 34:58.190
Mr. Doheny?

35:15.309 --> 35:16.469
<i>Thanks, Higgins.</i>

35:17.044 --> 35:18.204
Doheny is gone.

35:19.112 --> 35:20.773
We'd better find Geiger
before he does.

35:20.847 --> 35:22.371
I don't think Doheny
plans to take him back.

35:22.449 --> 35:25.441
He's a police officer. What
makes you come to that conclusion?

35:28.422 --> 35:29.719
The system failed him once.

35:29.790 --> 35:32.190
I don't think he's gonna
give it a second chance.

35:32.593 --> 35:34.493
<i>Wait, hold on a minute, dude.</i>

35:35.329 --> 35:37.820
I suppose you have an idea
where to start looking for him.

35:38.432 --> 35:39.421
I might.

41:04.257 --> 41:06.020
I'll give you anything you want.

41:07.327 --> 41:08.419
My parents will pay.

41:08.995 --> 41:10.360
Anything you ask.

41:15.468 --> 41:17.902
<i>Look, it won't do you any good
to take me back anyway, man!</i>

41:17.971 --> 41:19.905
My lawyers will get me
off. You know they will.

41:19.973 --> 41:21.440
I'll say Dusty did it.

41:24.878 --> 41:26.937
What difference
does it make to you?

41:28.548 --> 41:30.345
She was my granddaughter!

41:33.453 --> 41:35.318
You slimy bastard!

41:36.923 --> 41:39.050
<i>You beat her face to a pulp,</i>

41:39.292 --> 41:41.351
<i>you broke her body
down to nothing at all,</i>

41:41.428 --> 41:44.261
and then you threw her in
an alley and left her to die!

41:46.499 --> 41:48.933
And I'm gonna do
the same thing to you.

42:07.053 --> 42:08.145
Doheny!

42:57.671 --> 42:59.002
What happened here?

43:05.445 --> 43:06.742
Geiger had a knife.

43:13.486 --> 43:14.714
<i>Hey, Doheny.</i>

43:16.790 --> 43:18.052
Your gun permit?

43:18.758 --> 43:20.248
It just expired.

43:31.805 --> 43:33.864
<i>Hi. I'm Thomas Magnum.</i>

43:34.207 --> 43:36.835
<i>I'll bet it's pretty cold
back there in Tidewater.</i>

43:36.910 --> 43:39.037
<i>It never gets cold in Hawaii.</i>

43:39.112 --> 43:41.410
<i>I'm Billy's uncle, and he
asked me to make this tape</i>

43:41.481 --> 43:43.881
<i>about a day in the life
of a private investigator</i>

43:43.950 --> 43:45.747
<i>for him to bring
to show-and-tell.</i>

43:46.486 --> 43:50.047
<i>Okay. Well, one thing about
being a private investigator is,</i>

43:50.123 --> 43:52.353
<i>you can't really go out
and look for work.</i>

43:52.425 --> 43:55.394
<i>You have to wait for
the client to come to you.</i>

43:55.462 --> 43:57.487
<i>And sometimes they find you
in the Yellow Pages,</i>

43:57.564 --> 43:59.896
<i>sometimes they hear about you
from a friend,</i>

43:59.966 --> 44:03.129
<i>and sometimes they just
kind of stumble across you.</i>

44:03.636 --> 44:05.661
<i>It doesn't really matter
how they find you, I guess.</i>

44:05.739 --> 44:07.138
<i>The important thing is</i>

44:07.207 --> 44:08.196
<i>that they find you.</i>

44:08.708 --> 44:13.145
<i>Now, you probably think that every
case I take is really an exciting one.</i>

44:13.213 --> 44:15.704
<i>Well, to tell you the truth,</i>

44:15.782 --> 44:17.409
<i>there are some cases you forget</i>

44:17.484 --> 44:19.008
<i>the day after you finish them.</i>

44:20.620 --> 44:21.917
<i>And there are others</i>

44:22.388 --> 44:24.447
<i>you'll probably never forget.</i>

46:18.705 --> 46:20.468
<i>We got 'em, honey.</i>

46:20.573 --> 46:21.972
We got 'em.
