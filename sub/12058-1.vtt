WEBVTT

03:17.511 --> 03:21.055
I say there'll be a crowd at the
house tonight for you, Jimmy, huh?

03:21.056 --> 03:23.391
When did they let you out, Mossie?

03:23.392 --> 03:28.228
Just a month ago, after the
new government came in, like.

03:28.814 --> 03:30.646
How long did you serve?

03:30.982 --> 03:33.066
Three years.

03:34.193 --> 03:36.652
Awful tough on Angela.

03:37.655 --> 03:41.366
We had to send our eldest one, Kate,
off to her auntie in Scotland.

03:42.201 --> 03:47.080
- Is she back yet?
- Nah, I have to find some work first.

04:42.843 --> 04:45.511
Sorry old state now, Jimmy, huh?

04:46.305 --> 04:50.516
Meself and Tommy keep an eye on
the roof as best we can like, but...

04:51.393 --> 04:53.436
Some ghosts in there, eh?

04:53.979 --> 04:55.855
I still miss it.

04:56.982 --> 04:58.607
Go on, Dixie.

05:05.783 --> 05:09.033
Go on, Dixie. Walk on.

05:12.163 --> 05:13.830
Well, now.

05:16.876 --> 05:19.794
Whoa, Dixie. Stand there now.

05:25.009 --> 05:26.551
Stand.

05:26.552 --> 05:28.178
Mam!

05:28.179 --> 05:29.888
James!

05:39.273 --> 05:42.316
- You're back.
- How are you?

05:42.317 --> 05:44.443
Too long. Too long.

05:44.444 --> 05:47.655
I know. Sorry I didn't make
it back for Charlie's funeral.

05:47.656 --> 05:50.282
Just been to the grave.

05:50.283 --> 05:54.953
Oh, he was a good son, but this
farm is a mess without him.

06:00.752 --> 06:03.795
Ah, you bastard.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.448
God bless you, Jimmy.

06:41.042 --> 06:43.835
Hey-hey!

06:43.836 --> 06:46.128
Where's this bloody rogue?

06:46.129 --> 06:48.589
I could smell you were back.

06:48.590 --> 06:51.133
Great to see you. I can't
believe they let you out.

06:51.134 --> 06:53.761
About bloody time. Did you get lost?

06:53.762 --> 06:56.889
You were sorely missed, Jimmy.
Great to have you back.

06:56.890 --> 06:58.015
Thank you, Finn.

06:58.016 --> 07:00.309
- I believe you got married recently.
- I did.

07:00.310 --> 07:03.020
There's some fierce desperate
women in Leitrim...

07:04.522 --> 07:07.483
Well, Jimmy. Jimmy.

07:07.484 --> 07:10.277
You must have been around the
world twenty times by now.

07:10.278 --> 07:13.155
Well, thanks be to God you're
back here now with your mother

07:13.156 --> 07:15.574
because, you know,
it was lonely here for her.

07:15.575 --> 07:17.076
Very, very lonely.

07:17.077 --> 07:19.410
I missed you so much.

07:19.411 --> 07:23.498
Well, I'm home now to look after you.
It's great to see you all.

07:23.499 --> 07:25.124
Lovely to see you, Jimmy.

07:25.125 --> 07:27.293
What will you do with
yourself, Jimmy?

07:27.294 --> 07:31.923
Well, I'll settle back down with Mam,
and I've missed the land.

07:31.924 --> 07:35.009
- I want a quiet life now.
- Oh, I'll take bets on that.

07:35.010 --> 07:38.638
- Eh? A quiet life.
- You're on! Ten to one.

07:38.639 --> 07:41.474
I'll have some of your Yankee
dollars off you, boy, huh?

07:41.475 --> 07:43.559
I'm gonna hold you to that.

07:55.613 --> 07:59.198
Oonagh. Oonagh!

08:06.374 --> 08:10.126
- For your children.
- Oh, thank you.

08:14.966 --> 08:17.216
For you.

08:18.761 --> 08:20.511
OK.

08:24.808 --> 08:26.725
You look well, Oonagh.

08:28.478 --> 08:31.230
A bit grey around the edges.

08:31.231 --> 08:34.024
Still like a hungry whippet, though.

08:36.193 --> 08:38.904
Why did you stop writing, Jimmy?

08:39.530 --> 08:41.448
You know why.

08:44.411 --> 08:46.328
How are the children?

08:46.746 --> 08:50.040
Healthy. Full of spirit, thank God.

08:50.959 --> 08:56.337
- And Fintan?
- A good, steady man. Loving father.

08:57.256 --> 09:02.343
- You?
- Ah. Same as ever.

09:02.970 --> 09:06.055
Nobody's the same
after ten years, Jimmy.

09:08.058 --> 09:11.852
I have to get back. Thanks for these.

10:32.391 --> 10:33.973
Hey, Jimmy.

10:48.698 --> 10:50.990
He's very quiet.

10:51.701 --> 10:53.868
Ah, give him time.

10:55.162 --> 10:57.205
He's not the same man that went away.

10:57.206 --> 10:59.832
- Ah, he'll settle.
- Will he?

11:01.460 --> 11:03.753
He might. He might.

11:06.756 --> 11:09.383
Far cry from New York, eh, Jimmy?

11:09.384 --> 11:11.843
You don't get this down on Broadway.

11:12.679 --> 11:17.057
And here you are back down the
same feckin' bog in Leitrim, huh?

11:17.058 --> 11:19.601
- Wet feet.
- And a wet arse.

11:23.189 --> 11:28.443
Aye, but nobody yelling orders
at ya. Can't beat that.

11:33.074 --> 11:36.409
Well, word... word travels fast.

11:38.704 --> 11:40.997
Must be a great relief
to see your son again.

11:40.998 --> 11:42.623
It is.

11:43.125 --> 11:46.502
- Is he well?
- He's very well, Father.

11:46.503 --> 11:48.420
Thank you.

11:49.173 --> 11:51.924
A lot of water under the bridge.

11:51.925 --> 11:54.052
But, you know,
New York is a tough place.

11:54.053 --> 11:59.223
It'll be quite a shock from city
life to our humble country ways.

12:00.559 --> 12:03.478
Do you think he's matured?

12:03.479 --> 12:07.523
Well, we all change, Father.
Wouldn't you agree?

12:07.524 --> 12:10.851
Well, God willing, we all
change for the better.

12:11.152 --> 12:14.946
Do you think he'll, er...
do you think he'll stay?

12:14.947 --> 12:18.283
He was born in this house, Father.

12:18.826 --> 12:21.828
The decision will be his.
I will leave that up to him.

12:21.829 --> 12:25.499
You know, we've suffered great
violence in this country, Alice.

12:25.500 --> 12:26.625
Yeah.

12:26.626 --> 12:30.253
Brother against brother,
and neighbour against neighbour.

12:30.838 --> 12:34.257
Scars on the heart,
they take a long time to heal.

12:34.967 --> 12:40.305
But I... I sense a new atmosphere,
you know, of... of change.

12:40.306 --> 12:42.473
Of forgiveness.

12:43.475 --> 12:45.559
Would you agree?

12:45.977 --> 12:49.939
Oh, I would agree, Father,
but there must be mutual respect.

12:49.940 --> 12:54.109
Well, let's pray there'll be no
slipping back to the old ways.

12:54.694 --> 12:56.237
Oh, by the way, tell your son

12:56.238 --> 12:59.782
if the quietness of the country
gets too much for a man of action,

12:59.783 --> 13:03.953
I have some excellent contacts in London
who could find him a very good job,

13:03.954 --> 13:09.750
which, of course, would be a great
relief to a mother in these hard times.

13:11.420 --> 13:14.338
Where would you be now
without a nice cup of tea, huh?

13:14.339 --> 13:17.466
Absolutely lost, Father.

14:17.775 --> 14:20.443
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on, boy.

14:21.820 --> 14:24.154
Sorry to stop your fun.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.119
Are you who I think you are?

14:30.120 --> 14:31.913
Are you, J... Jimmy Gralton?

14:31.914 --> 14:33.748
And who wants to know?

14:33.749 --> 14:35.917
My name's Marie O'Keefe.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.543
Daughter of Dennis O'Keefe?

14:37.544 --> 14:39.921
He hates you with a passion.

14:39.922 --> 14:42.548
Nearly had a fit when the
priest said you were back.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.509
Did he now? Come on.

14:52.434 --> 14:55.184
Dance away now.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.313
Have you seen O'Keefe?

14:58.314 --> 15:03.401
He left the Free State Army a few years
back there after his first wife died.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.320
He was on his own
with Marie for a while,

15:05.321 --> 15:07.781
and then he struck gold
and married into land.

15:07.782 --> 15:10.116
He's mad as hell about the
change of government,

15:10.117 --> 15:11.952
calling de Valera a communist.

15:11.953 --> 15:16.122
Big shot now in the Army Comrades
Association. You know them?

15:16.123 --> 15:18.875
Yeah, afraid they won't be
able to export to England.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.335
Ah, bunch of fascists.

15:20.336 --> 15:24.130
Stay well clear of him.
Nasty as ever.

15:24.131 --> 15:26.340
And with a long memory.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.178
- Jimmy!
- Jimmy!

15:31.179 --> 15:34.056
- Jimmy.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:34.057 --> 15:37.142
- Stop, stop, stop.
- What's all this, the Wild West?

15:37.143 --> 15:38.894
Can we have a word?

15:38.895 --> 15:41.564
- Well, are we under arrest?
- Not yet, anyway.

15:41.565 --> 15:44.692
- Go ahead, ask him.
- I won't ask him. You ask him.

15:44.693 --> 15:48.237
The hall, Jimmy. We've all
heard stories, lots of them.

15:48.238 --> 15:51.907
My brother's been telling me the stories
of when he used to box in the gym.

15:51.908 --> 15:55.286
Tommy, if the hall was fixed up,
you could do the woodwork lessons.

15:55.287 --> 15:59.372
My uncle did the woodwork lessons. He's
one of the best carpenters in the town.

15:59.373 --> 16:01.833
Tess could use the hall
for her art classes.

16:01.834 --> 16:03.960
The paintings and
drawings are wonderful.

16:03.961 --> 16:05.378
I met Sean yesterday,

16:05.379 --> 16:08.798
and he still has all his poetry and
books from the foreign countries.

16:08.799 --> 16:11.843
He said he'd do the lessons
again if there was a hall there.

16:11.844 --> 16:13.886
He really wants to do it.
Please, Jimmy.

16:13.887 --> 16:17.307
And the music by Molly and
the singing by Oonagh.

16:17.308 --> 16:19.475
There's nothing round here for us.

16:19.476 --> 16:21.936
There's no work.
There's nowhere for us to go.

16:21.937 --> 16:23.938
We can't go to America
the same as yourself.

16:23.939 --> 16:26.691
The rules of immigration
has changed. We're stuck here.

16:26.692 --> 16:30.111
Stop going around in circles. Just
ask the man what we came here for.

16:30.112 --> 16:33.797
We want to dance, Jimmy. Somewhere
where we won't be getting a guard...

16:33.798 --> 16:36.491
or a priest poking
at us with a stick.

16:36.492 --> 16:40.329
Somewhere warm. Please, Jimmy,
will you open up the hall again?

16:40.330 --> 16:41.622
Aye.

16:41.623 --> 16:44.291
It's falling to pieces.
It's not even safe any more.

16:46.919 --> 16:48.712
You don't understand.

16:50.673 --> 16:53.883
Come on, boy. Come on, boy.
Come on, boy.

16:55.720 --> 16:58.805
Come on, boy. Come on. Come on.

16:58.806 --> 17:01.475
At least think about it, will you?
Think about it, yeah?

17:01.476 --> 17:04.309
So much for the legend
of Jimmy Gralton.

17:05.520 --> 17:08.021
You better change the
name of the hall.

17:08.022 --> 17:10.732
James Connolly will be
turning in his grave.

18:44.408 --> 18:46.575
Right. Come on, up.

18:47.703 --> 18:49.912
So, how long have you
been working at this?

18:49.913 --> 18:51.622
Oh, for the past few months,

18:51.623 --> 18:55.460
whenever the lads get a bit of free time,
in the evenings, at the weekends.

18:55.461 --> 18:59.046
We're planning on opening in two or
three weeks, and we're on schedule.

18:59.047 --> 19:01.299
Ah, Dessie, for Jesus' sake! Hello?

19:01.300 --> 19:03.968
- Can I have one of these?
- Dessie! Come on!

19:03.969 --> 19:07.388
I'm after milking six cows this morning.
I'm starved of the hunger.

19:07.389 --> 19:10.474
Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
give me patience!

19:11.477 --> 19:14.227
Look at him with the
sandwich in his mouth.

19:14.228 --> 19:16.772
Up we go. How's that?

19:16.773 --> 19:21.110
- Jesus!
- Shite! Shite!

19:22.987 --> 19:26.114
The Tans burnt the church hall
down in Gowell about a year ago,

19:26.115 --> 19:29.117
- so we decided to build our own.
- With, er, what money?

19:29.118 --> 19:32.454
I had some savings from the States,
and a few friends, too.

19:32.455 --> 19:36.041
So, if it's your money and your land,
does that mean that it's your hall?

19:36.042 --> 19:39.836
No. It's built by the voluntary
labour of the community,

19:39.837 --> 19:41.797
and it's run by an elected committee.

19:41.798 --> 19:45.217
I'll teach art, and Molly and
Oonagh will teach the music.

19:45.218 --> 19:50.471
And Mossie the boxing, gymnastics,
woodwork. Literature.

19:50.472 --> 19:53.557
And every penny'll go back
into the hall to buy materials.

19:53.558 --> 19:55.434
Musical instruments, books...

19:55.435 --> 19:58.437
And we'll have the best damned
dances in the whole country.

19:58.438 --> 20:02.483
I just spoke to your parish priest.
Not best pleased.

20:02.484 --> 20:05.361
Even said that all the horses
that dragged the sand here

20:05.362 --> 20:07.071
will die within a year.

20:07.072 --> 20:08.906
Is he a priest or a witch doctor?

20:08.907 --> 20:12.909
Our opposition is still the same,
the masters and the pastors.

21:09.132 --> 21:11.633
Come in, Father. You're welcome.

21:11.634 --> 21:13.594
Gralton, you come out.

21:13.595 --> 21:16.138
It's Mr Gralton to you, Sheridan.

21:16.139 --> 21:17.973
Who in the hell do you think you are,

21:17.974 --> 21:20.559
running classes in my parish
without my permission?

21:20.560 --> 21:24.353
No permission required.
That's the point, we built it ourselves.

21:24.354 --> 21:29.025
Education is the exclusive
reserve of Holy Mother Church,

21:29.026 --> 21:30.568
not semi-illiterates.

21:30.569 --> 21:33.863
- Don't patronise me.
- No, Jimmy, don't...

21:33.864 --> 21:38.367
I will not have a communist
on my turf defy the Church.

21:38.368 --> 21:41.286
Now, days of tugging
the forelock are gone.

21:41.747 --> 21:44.390
Oh, bare arms.

21:44.791 --> 21:46.834
Hardly becomes you.

21:46.877 --> 21:49.670
Does your father know you're
here, Oonagh Dempsey?

21:49.671 --> 21:53.507
If you'd like to enroll in our dance class,
Father, you're more than welcome.

21:53.508 --> 21:56.968
It doesn't cost a penny,
and we're all volunteers.

22:03.517 --> 22:06.353
I'm here to represent my
neighbour, Rory McManus,

22:06.354 --> 22:08.063
who is the rightful tenant.

22:08.064 --> 22:11.232
That land has been in their
family for over thirty years,

22:11.233 --> 22:14.361
but, due to ill health,
he fell behind on the rent.

22:14.362 --> 22:17.113
That landlord wouldn't give
him the time to catch up,

22:17.114 --> 22:19.282
and he threw him off his land.

22:19.283 --> 22:22.118
My name is Seamus Clarke.
I am the new tenant.

22:22.119 --> 22:25.163
I rented this land in good faith and
for a fair price from the landlord.

22:25.164 --> 22:26.665
Shame on you, Clarke.

22:26.666 --> 22:29.667
You've had your beady eye on
that land next door for years.

22:29.668 --> 22:31.752
Silence in the court.

22:31.753 --> 22:34.421
This court has reached
a unanimous decision.

22:34.422 --> 22:40.010
The tenant, Rory McManus, is entitled
to the recovery of the land in dispute.

22:41.346 --> 22:43.973
And the cattle belonging
to Seamus Clarke

22:43.974 --> 22:45.683
will be removed immediately.

22:51.898 --> 22:55.317
Jimmy. Jimmy.

22:55.318 --> 22:57.611
It's O'Keefe. He's up
there with his army.

22:57.612 --> 23:01.281
Doherty's there with his thugs, too.
And the priest is just after arriving.

23:01.282 --> 23:05.201
- You're not gonna get by.
- Good work, son. Good man.

23:05.202 --> 23:06.869
- The Holy Trinity.
- Bastards.

23:06.870 --> 23:09.372
Take it easy. It's not the
Tans we're fighting now.

23:09.373 --> 23:10.915
It's feckin' worse.

23:11.625 --> 23:14.836
Open up, Clarke.
Here's your cattle back.

23:14.837 --> 23:16.963
Keep them off your neighbour's land.

23:16.964 --> 23:19.048
Gralton, you pay attention to me.

23:19.049 --> 23:22.385
You sow nothing but conflict
in a peaceful community.

23:22.386 --> 23:25.013
Go and join the commies
in Siberia. Leave us alone.

23:25.014 --> 23:26.639
You join the British.

23:26.640 --> 23:29.809
I'll tell you whose land it is.
Where's Rory? Come here, Rory.

23:29.810 --> 23:32.395
McManus, you took advantage
of a tenant in trouble.

23:32.396 --> 23:36.898
This is a statement from the
acting OC of the IRA in this area.

23:36.899 --> 23:39.276
Now, listen up if you
know what's good for you.

23:39.277 --> 23:41.153
We fought the British too, Doherty.

23:41.154 --> 23:43.488
Look at him having
to read for Doherty.

23:43.489 --> 23:45.824
Let him have his word. Read away.

23:45.825 --> 23:49.453
"Whereas certain evilly disposed
and unauthorised persons

23:49.454 --> 23:52.748
"in certain districts within
the area of South Leitrim

23:52.749 --> 23:56.084
"have commandeered and taken
forcible possession of lands

23:56.085 --> 23:58.837
"to which they are not entitled..."

23:58.838 --> 24:03.175
- Yeah, back in 1690.
- Silence, silence, silence!

24:03.176 --> 24:07.178
"We do hereby order that
anyone found commandeering

24:07.179 --> 24:10.723
"or interfering with lands to
which such a person has no claim

24:10.724 --> 24:12.808
"shall be severely dealt with."

24:12.809 --> 24:14.727
Are you threatening us?

24:14.728 --> 24:17.897
We intend to implement the
decision of the Republican court.

24:17.898 --> 24:20.733
- Yes!
- Now stand aside!

24:20.734 --> 24:23.944
Any man goes through that gate
gets a bullet in the head.

24:23.945 --> 24:27.782
- Put those guns away!
- You'll be the first to hit the ground.

24:27.783 --> 24:30.534
Put those guns down immediately!

24:30.535 --> 24:33.287
Put it down! Put them down!

24:33.288 --> 24:36.332
I don't want any
innocent blood spilt.

24:36.333 --> 24:39.834
Bide your time.
There's a time and a place.

24:39.835 --> 24:43.212
Do as I say now. Now!

24:47.301 --> 24:50.469
- Open that gate.
- Sean. Mossie.

24:55.309 --> 24:57.477
Put your guns away.

24:57.478 --> 24:59.854
- Guns away?
- Yes.

24:59.855 --> 25:02.357
- Bring the cows in.
- Bring them through.

25:02.358 --> 25:05.735
Stand aside. Stand aside.
Go on, stand over.

25:06.821 --> 25:08.279
Stand aside.

25:08.280 --> 25:11.241
Dessie. Dessie, usher them in.

25:11.242 --> 25:14.200
Stand by them, stand by them.

25:17.872 --> 25:20.499
Let them through.

25:28.842 --> 25:33.511
Siúil, siúil, siúil a rúin

25:34.430 --> 25:40.227
Siúil go socair agus siúil go ciúin

25:40.228 --> 25:46.023
Siúil go doras agus éalaigh liúm

25:46.024 --> 25:54.531
Is go dté tú mo mhúirnín slán

25:54.992 --> 25:59.912
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain

25:59.913 --> 26:04.959
I wish I had my heart again

26:04.960 --> 26:11.382
And vainly think I'd not complain

26:11.383 --> 26:19.722
Is go dté tú mo mhúirnín slán

26:20.057 --> 26:25.395
Siúil, siúil, siúil a rúin

26:25.396 --> 26:30.192
Siúil go socair agus siúil go ciúin

26:30.193 --> 26:31.526
Siúil go...

26:32.727 --> 26:36.740
- I want Gralton! He's under arrest!
- What for?

26:36.741 --> 26:40.410
There'll be no more anarchy in Leitrim.
No more of your kangaroo courts.

26:40.411 --> 26:42.120
Show us the warrant!

26:44.498 --> 26:46.916
You've got to get out! Get out!

26:48.544 --> 26:50.711
Go! Go!

26:57.844 --> 27:01.263
Get out! Get out!

27:01.264 --> 27:03.458
Get out of here!

27:04.059 --> 27:06.768
Get away with you!

27:28.874 --> 27:32.418
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll head to the States.

27:35.839 --> 27:39.300
Oh, that looks a sore one. I'm sorry.

27:39.301 --> 27:40.843
It's nothing.

27:40.844 --> 27:44.889
It was worth it to see the
expression on his face, the bastard.

27:45.099 --> 27:49.226
Will you say goodbye to Mam for me?
They're watching the farm.

27:50.437 --> 27:52.897
How long are you gone for, Jimmy?

27:53.190 --> 27:55.023
Till things calm down.

27:55.024 --> 27:58.610
There's a few pistol boys keen
to make a name for themselves.

27:59.070 --> 28:03.031
I've a few good comrades over in
New York who'll help me find work.

28:05.243 --> 28:07.660
Mossie's waiting for me.

28:09.080 --> 28:11.706
What if I asked you to
come with me, Oonagh?

28:14.043 --> 28:16.670
What if my mother wasn't fading?

28:16.671 --> 28:19.923
What if I wasn't the only daughter?
What if my dad wouldn't fall apart?

28:20.550 --> 28:23.134
What if I wasn't so trapped, Jimmy?

28:23.636 --> 28:25.720
What if, Oonagh?

28:27.389 --> 28:29.557
And follow you around?

28:29.558 --> 28:32.810
From one battle to the next?
Can I take that?

28:36.857 --> 28:39.399
Are these the only clothes you have?

28:40.110 --> 28:42.862
I hear they sell clothes in New York.

28:42.863 --> 28:44.864
I suppose so.

28:46.700 --> 28:49.117
Jimmy...

28:53.040 --> 28:57.626
You'll be in my heart, girl.
No matter what.

28:57.627 --> 28:59.378
Till the day I die.

29:34.621 --> 29:39.333
Well, Jimmy... I think
you lost your bet.

29:39.334 --> 29:41.919
Couldn't stay away.
Like a moth to a flame.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.629
More like a dog to a post.

29:43.630 --> 29:46.256
That feckin' gable's
never been right anyway.

29:46.257 --> 29:48.592
- I wonder who built that, Tommy.
- Dessie did.

29:50.428 --> 29:52.762
Are you ready for this again, Jimmy?

29:55.767 --> 29:58.644
Jeez. Life's too short.

29:58.645 --> 30:01.230
- We've no choice, do we?
- No.

30:01.231 --> 30:04.190
- Come on, there's work to be done.
- Aye.

30:12.157 --> 30:14.283
It's a beaut, eh?

30:27.339 --> 30:30.550
Is that what you had in that trunk
that near broke my back, is it?

30:30.551 --> 30:33.260
It'll be well worth it, Mossie.

30:33.971 --> 30:36.639
- What the hell is it, Jimmy?
- His pet.

30:41.644 --> 30:45.480
Looks grand, but I don't know
what we're gonna feed it on.

30:58.161 --> 31:00.454
We'll have music while we work now.

31:03.374 --> 31:06.292
It's a beautiful sound, isn't it?

31:08.754 --> 31:10.880
Nice, Jimmy.

31:10.881 --> 31:14.175
Jimmy, did you ever go to a jazz
club when you were in Harlem?

31:14.176 --> 31:18.512
I did, aye. The Savoy Ballroom.
Aye, grand musicians.

31:18.513 --> 31:20.473
The only place in the United States

31:20.474 --> 31:22.850
where black and white
dance together in peace.

31:22.851 --> 31:24.435
- Really?
- Aye, marvellous.

31:24.436 --> 31:26.645
Did you ever dance with
a black woman, Jimmy?

31:28.273 --> 31:31.233
You know what the most
amazing thing about it was?

31:31.234 --> 31:33.695
They've two legs like everyone else.

31:34.196 --> 31:37.311
Go on there, Jimmy.
Show us a few steps.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.533
- Go on!
- Honestly...

31:39.534 --> 31:42.453
- Please, go on.
- Please, Jimmy, come on.

31:42.454 --> 31:44.621
All right, all right, all right!

31:45.122 --> 31:47.373
All right.

31:48.667 --> 31:52.211
- If I can only remember them.
- Ah, go on, Jimmy, son.

31:54.131 --> 31:56.465
Go on, Jimmy.

32:04.934 --> 32:08.353
I've a chicken at home that can
do exactly the same dance.

32:25.161 --> 32:26.703
Come on.

32:32.210 --> 32:34.703
Stop leading, Oonagh.

32:50.185 --> 32:54.188
Now, come on. Shim-sham time!

32:54.648 --> 32:56.607
And shim-sham.

32:58.694 --> 33:00.819
Right foot first.

33:01.738 --> 33:04.656
And right again.
All right! Same again.

33:05.993 --> 33:09.203
Left foot again. Good.

33:09.204 --> 33:14.041
Oh, show us the beginning. Show us
the beginning. That's very hard.

33:14.042 --> 33:17.920
Let's go back to the start.
Right foot first.

33:17.921 --> 33:19.671
And right.

33:20.339 --> 33:22.215
And a right again.

33:22.967 --> 33:25.718
Left foot now. All right.

33:26.137 --> 33:27.720
Right again.

33:37.396 --> 33:38.981
Good work!

33:46.657 --> 33:49.034
"I went out to the Hazel Wood,

33:49.035 --> 33:51.828
"Because a fire was in my head.

33:52.079 --> 33:54.538
"And cut and peeled a hazel wand,

33:54.539 --> 33:56.998
"And hooked a berry to a thread.

33:57.959 --> 34:00.961
"And when white moths
were on the wing,

34:00.962 --> 34:04.131
"And moth-like stars
were flickering out,

34:04.507 --> 34:09.010
"I dropped the berry in a stream
And caught a little silver trout.

34:10.263 --> 34:15.391
"When I had laid it on the floor,
I went to blow the fire a-flame.

34:15.393 --> 34:19.938
"But something rustled on the floor
And someone called me by my name.

34:20.106 --> 34:23.609
"It had become a glimmering girl,

34:23.610 --> 34:28.404
"With apple blossom in her hair
Who called me by my name and ran,

34:28.405 --> 34:31.574
"And faded through
the brightening air.

34:32.076 --> 34:34.494
"Though I am old with wandering,

34:34.495 --> 34:37.330
"Through hollow lands
and hilly lands,

34:37.331 --> 34:40.081
"I will find out where she has gone

34:40.083 --> 34:42.752
"And kiss her lips
and take her hands,

34:42.753 --> 34:45.713
"And walk among long dappled grass,

34:45.797 --> 34:49.175
"And pluck till time
and times are done,

34:49.551 --> 34:54.554
"The silver apples of the moon,
The golden apples of the sun."

34:54.556 --> 34:56.516
- Beautiful, Roisin.
- That was beautiful.

34:56.516 --> 34:58.642
- It was beautiful, darling.
- Thank you.

34:58.643 --> 35:00.977
You made it sound so real.

35:00.978 --> 35:04.272
Next week, we'll talk about
what influenced Yeats.

35:04.273 --> 35:06.650
Irish folklore, Greek myth,

35:06.651 --> 35:12.030
and even Maud Gonne's
continuous refusal of him. Erm...

35:12.031 --> 35:16.702
But for now, let's just talk about how
it felt as the words swept over you.

35:16.703 --> 35:19.705
Ah, but sure, you know,
does all that longing,

35:19.706 --> 35:23.166
does it break your heart or
does it fill you up with hope?

35:23.167 --> 35:26.545
You know, the way she's always,
er, just out of reach,

35:26.546 --> 35:29.464
or changing shape or
whatever, you know.

35:29.465 --> 35:31.924
But I suppose, er,
in fairness to him,

35:31.925 --> 35:34.551
he tried till his dying
breath to find her.

35:49.651 --> 35:51.569
Here we are, how are you getting on?

35:51.570 --> 35:54.655
I was just trying to get
the overall shape here...

35:54.656 --> 35:58.159
Loosen everything up and just see
what happens, but great work.

35:58.160 --> 35:59.993
That's lovely.

36:02.414 --> 36:05.165
- How are you getting on, Ruari?
- Good, yeah.

36:05.166 --> 36:06.291
Great, I'd say...

36:06.292 --> 36:08.835
One, two. Cross. Cross, go on.

36:08.836 --> 36:11.421
Keep that head beneath
the chin. Good man.

36:11.422 --> 36:13.423
Keep that guard up.

36:13.424 --> 36:16.885
Jab. Cross now, cross. And guard up.

36:16.886 --> 36:20.054
Alright, Shane, Shane,
take a wee break there now.

36:20.055 --> 36:22.807
- Good man.
- Go on then, tiger.

36:22.808 --> 36:24.934
One, two. One, two.

36:24.935 --> 36:28.146
Don't forget your guard. Good man.

36:28.147 --> 36:31.316
- That was below the belt, was it?
- Come on, jab.

36:31.317 --> 36:34.235
- Come on, wake up. One, two.
- Good man.

36:34.236 --> 36:37.196
That's the one that's gonna
give him a pain in the belly.

36:37.197 --> 36:39.865
Hold on. Hold on, hold on.
You're all over the place here now.

36:39.866 --> 36:42.826
Come on. Straight shots, right?

36:42.827 --> 36:44.953
Stand back a little bit. Go on, now.

36:44.954 --> 36:47.080
- Go on, good man.
- Is that the best you got?

36:47.081 --> 36:50.584
- Straight, straight.
- Come on! I can't feel it.

36:50.585 --> 36:53.504
- Ow! Jesus!
- Well, that's what you get...

36:53.505 --> 36:55.631
Feckin' gobshite!

36:57.175 --> 37:00.385
"The Pearse-Connolly
Hall opens again."

37:00.386 --> 37:03.222
I see they've a dance this weekend.

37:03.223 --> 37:04.932
Maybe we should pop along, huh?

37:04.933 --> 37:08.518
Hmm. Advertised in a communist
newspaper. Look at that.

37:08.519 --> 37:12.813
"Classes of every sort."
Defiance, that's what that is.

37:14.066 --> 37:17.443
Well, with respect,
it's probably best to just ignore it.

37:17.444 --> 37:21.196
Repression breeds belligerence,
isn't that what they say?

37:23.325 --> 37:27.453
Yeah, "From each according to his
ability, to each according to his need."

37:27.454 --> 37:29.864
The Communist Manifesto.

37:30.165 --> 37:34.085
Quasi religious. It's like "Love
thy neighbour as thyself."

37:34.086 --> 37:35.461
The language of brotherhood.

37:35.462 --> 37:38.548
It spreads like wildfire in
a world of rampant greed.

37:38.549 --> 37:41.883
Do you realise how attractive
that is in the slums?

37:41.884 --> 37:45.762
To the poor, to the unemployed?
The landless?

37:45.763 --> 37:48.640
This Depression has destroyed
lives around the world.

37:48.641 --> 37:50.225
Misery breeds desperation,

37:50.226 --> 37:53.228
and it only takes a handful of
communists to set the fuse...

37:53.229 --> 37:54.646
Don't get carried away now.

37:54.647 --> 37:57.691
There can only be 150 or 200
communists in the entire country.

37:57.692 --> 38:00.652
One man, one book,
changed the world. Karl Marx.

38:00.653 --> 38:03.446
Jimmy Gralton isn't Karl Marx.
He's just a worker, now.

38:03.447 --> 38:08.493
Listen, his mother ran a mobile library.
Never patronise the self-taught man,

38:08.494 --> 38:11.079
especially someone who
worked down the mines.

38:11.080 --> 38:14.498
He's a maverick, all right, but he's
a lightweight maverick, so...

38:14.499 --> 38:17.418
Fire in his soul and
a plan in his head.

38:17.419 --> 38:20.921
You can't buy him off. No.

38:20.922 --> 38:24.091
He's not greedy, he's not selfish.

38:24.259 --> 38:29.096
You know... They remind
me of the first martyrs.

38:29.472 --> 38:33.350
D'you ever read about those union
organisers in the States? The Wobblies.

38:33.351 --> 38:36.144
Entering towns and factories.

38:36.438 --> 38:40.107
Thrown into prisons,
lynched, murdered.

38:40.108 --> 38:42.067
If every priest had their grit...

38:42.068 --> 38:45.070
Well, there's nothing as
dramatic as that here.

38:45.071 --> 38:48.489
It's just a tiny little hall,
in a country bog.

38:48.490 --> 38:51.618
- Yeah, with a gramophone.
- With a gramophone.

38:51.619 --> 38:53.578
First it's the dancing,
then the books.

38:53.579 --> 38:55.288
He'll start at the
bottom with their feet

38:55.289 --> 38:58.224
and work up to their
brains, if they have any.

38:58.709 --> 39:02.044
That bloody book. Das Kapital.

39:03.714 --> 39:05.632
I'm going to get one, too.

39:05.633 --> 39:07.383
Going to get the book, are you?

39:07.384 --> 39:10.511
A feckin' gramophone,
you bloody eejit.

39:10.888 --> 39:13.765
Is there any marmalade in this house?

39:13.766 --> 39:16.517
There is. Especially for you.

39:16.518 --> 39:18.560
- Thank you.
- Go easy, go easy.

39:26.861 --> 39:28.570
See you in a little while.

39:35.286 --> 39:37.078
Jimmy!

39:53.387 --> 39:54.804
- Hi!
- Hello.

39:54.805 --> 39:56.597
This is Colm and Clodagh.

39:56.598 --> 39:59.058
Colm, young man. Lovely to meet you.

39:59.059 --> 40:01.894
This is Jimmy who brought you
the presents from America.

40:01.895 --> 40:03.479
Lovely to meet you.

40:03.480 --> 40:07.191
Jimmy. Time flies.
Some things haven't changed.

40:07.192 --> 40:10.528
- You're looking well, Fintan.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

40:10.529 --> 40:12.488
Now, will you two, will you dance?

40:12.489 --> 40:14.699
A little. Maybe a little.

40:14.700 --> 40:17.785
- Just a little bit?
- And thanks for the presents.

40:17.786 --> 40:19.829
- Oh, did you like it?
- Yep.

40:19.830 --> 40:23.581
Lovely. And you played with them?
That's the main thing.

40:23.582 --> 40:26.209
- We know these two men.
- Who are these two?

40:26.210 --> 40:29.545
Yeah, that's Michael
Fitzpatrick there.

40:30.089 --> 40:31.548
Er, Fiona Gallagher.

40:31.549 --> 40:33.341
- There's Fiona.
- Yes, I know you.

40:33.342 --> 40:36.802
- Amy Gilligan.
- Amy Gilligan, right. Just a moment.

40:41.350 --> 40:44.352
- Where have you come from?
- Up the road, Father.

40:44.353 --> 40:46.855
- Up the road where?
- Up the road and round the bend.

40:46.856 --> 40:50.650
- What bend would that be, young man?
- It's a fierce bendy road, Father.

40:50.651 --> 40:54.112
- What bend was it, lads?
- Up at O'Hara's white horse.

40:54.113 --> 40:57.364
Marie O'Keefe,
what are you doing here?

40:57.365 --> 40:59.116
I came here to dance, Father.

40:59.117 --> 41:02.202
Is the proper parish dance not
good enough for you, huh?

41:02.203 --> 41:03.704
Yes, Father.

41:03.705 --> 41:07.082
Does your father know you're
in a car with outsiders? Huh?

41:07.751 --> 41:11.711
Put her name down. Marie O'Keefe,
And what's that driver's name?

41:12.964 --> 41:15.007
Think we're doing
more harm than good.

41:15.008 --> 41:18.594
- Look at the wee child.
- This poor child, will you look at her?

41:18.595 --> 41:23.432
That child should be home in bed.
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

41:23.433 --> 41:25.059
And who is this behind them?

41:25.060 --> 41:28.519
- Who's that, the fella smoking?
- That's Brian McMahon.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.438
And Tommy Doyle.

45:01.686 --> 45:05.688
What is this craze for pleasure?

45:06.732 --> 45:11.194
This fascination with
the materialist?

45:11.195 --> 45:13.530
The pagan, the Anglo Saxon?

45:13.531 --> 45:19.868
And most recently, the Los
Angelisation of our culture?

45:19.953 --> 45:23.497
What is wrong with
being true to ourselves,

45:23.498 --> 45:25.749
to our deepest roots,

45:25.750 --> 45:29.836
to our own true Irish values?

45:31.006 --> 45:35.926
Did not Cromwell himself try to
burn all the harps in the land,

45:35.927 --> 45:41.306
murder our priests,
exile our musicians?

45:41.891 --> 45:46.061
They tried to crush our
language, our song, our dance,

45:46.062 --> 45:51.316
but our forefathers resisted
them in their hedge schools,

45:51.317 --> 45:54.151
risking their very lives.

45:54.695 --> 45:58.072
Oh, how they must
turn in their graves

45:58.073 --> 46:04.954
to see our youths debase themselves
in Jimmy Gralton's hall.

46:48.664 --> 46:51.207
Jazz music.

46:51.751 --> 46:58.130
Rhythms from darkest Africa
that inflame the passions.

46:58.757 --> 47:01.759
Pelvic thrusts and
salacious body grappling,

47:01.760 --> 47:06.805
instead of the elegance and
beauty of our own Irish dances.

47:08.350 --> 47:12.603
And then, of course, we have company
keeping under the stars at night.

47:13.563 --> 47:16.189
Joy-riding until dawn...

47:16.900 --> 47:22.738
with unsuitables on the prowl from
distant parts in their motor cars.

47:22.739 --> 47:27.366
Occasions of sin multiplied
beyond our imagination.

47:28.953 --> 47:34.081
But there is something even
more evil hatching in that hall.

47:34.625 --> 47:40.212
Gralton and his crew...
are communists.

47:41.173 --> 47:42.757
They are atheists.

47:42.758 --> 47:48.179
They deny the existence
of God, the Trinity

47:48.180 --> 47:50.473
and the Virgin birth.

47:52.351 --> 47:55.853
So, our community faces a choice.

47:56.355 --> 48:00.983
Is it Christ... or is it Gralton?

48:12.245 --> 48:16.248
Now, the Church has a right,
and even a duty,

48:16.249 --> 48:17.958
to protect the vulnerable.

48:17.959 --> 48:23.421
So what I do now, I do in
the spirit of God's love.

48:24.299 --> 48:27.301
I will now read out the
names of those people

48:27.302 --> 48:32.137
who attended Gralton's
Hall last night.

48:32.598 --> 48:37.601
And other priests in other
parishes will be doing the same.

48:39.229 --> 48:41.730
And here are the names.

48:44.359 --> 48:46.777
Amy Gilligan.

48:48.322 --> 48:50.990
Deirdre Kearns.

48:51.074 --> 48:54.118
Johnóg Conlon.

48:54.286 --> 48:57.079
Mrs Oonagh Mulvey.

48:57.706 --> 49:00.082
Niamh Kearns.

49:00.417 --> 49:02.584
Emma Duggan.

49:02.628 --> 49:05.086
Mrs Teresa Hanrahan.

49:05.254 --> 49:07.797
Margaret Carty.

49:08.466 --> 49:10.717
David O'Reilly.

49:12.303 --> 49:14.388
Paul O'Brian.

49:15.389 --> 49:19.017
Marie O'Keefe,
joy-riding with unsuitables.

49:21.521 --> 49:23.980
Kieran Brennan.

49:27.902 --> 49:30.028
Eoghan O'Neill.

49:30.029 --> 49:31.905
Sarah Conlon.

49:31.906 --> 49:34.074
Rory O'Dowd.

49:34.075 --> 49:36.284
Eoin O'Neill.

49:36.993 --> 49:40.245
Christian Pindar.

49:43.708 --> 49:45.917
Darragh O'Malley.

49:56.054 --> 49:58.097
- Get the girls inside.
- Calm down.

49:58.098 --> 50:00.098
Take the girls inside.

50:01.768 --> 50:03.560
Get out, you.

50:04.729 --> 50:07.731
- Don't you hurt her.
- Take them inside.

50:08.358 --> 50:12.402
Smirking at the priest.
Humiliating the family name. Come on.

50:12.403 --> 50:15.446
- Don't you hurt her.
- Take them inside!

50:17.575 --> 50:18.908
Get in there.

50:18.909 --> 50:20.659
Take off your jacket.

50:29.044 --> 50:31.504
Take off your jacket.

50:32.506 --> 50:34.257
Take off your jacket!

50:36.302 --> 50:38.469
Stay away from Gralton's Hall!
You hear me?

50:39.170 --> 50:42.598
Do you hear me?
Stay away from Gralton's Hall!

50:42.599 --> 50:46.435
Stay away from it! Hear?
You want some more? Do ya?

50:47.036 --> 50:49.271
Do you want some more? Do ya?

50:49.272 --> 50:52.440
Promise me! Stay away from it!

50:53.109 --> 50:56.769
Promise me that! Stay away from it!

50:58.781 --> 51:02.450
Do you want some more? Do ya?

51:06.789 --> 51:10.208
You had time to think long
and hard in prison, Mossie.

51:10.209 --> 51:13.962
You don't want to end up on the
wrong side of history again, no?

51:13.963 --> 51:17.423
An embittered old man with
not a penny to your name.

51:17.424 --> 51:19.008
You've so much to live for.

51:19.009 --> 51:22.469
You've got a lovely spouse.
Isn't that right, Angela?

51:22.763 --> 51:26.557
And I could get you a job
for life in the Council.

51:27.059 --> 51:32.563
Watch your children grow
up in security. Educated.

51:33.565 --> 51:36.108
You're at a crossroads, Mossie.

51:37.361 --> 51:44.283
Listen to me. You could even get
little Katie back from Scotland. Hmm?

51:48.329 --> 51:51.998
- Would you like a scone, Father?
- Thank you. Thank you, Angela.

51:53.084 --> 51:55.293
Here's a picture of our little Katie.

51:55.294 --> 51:57.379
Oh, isn't she a dote?

51:57.380 --> 52:00.799
- Beautiful little girl.
- Just like her mammy.

52:00.800 --> 52:03.426
- Thank you, Father.
- You must miss her terribly.

52:03.427 --> 52:05.553
Very, very much.

52:07.306 --> 52:10.934
Oh, we have the Redemptorist Fathers
coming to the parish for a mission.

52:10.935 --> 52:14.229
What if I was to bring around a
doctor of divinity into your house,

52:14.230 --> 52:17.399
to explain to you where
Gralton is leading you astray?

52:17.400 --> 52:22.069
What if I was to bring a doctor of
economics round to your house, Father,

52:22.070 --> 52:25.197
and explain to you where
you're going astray?

52:25.198 --> 52:27.533
Loyalty is a noble thing,

52:27.534 --> 52:32.746
but misplaced loyalty, for a man
with children, is a tragedy.

52:33.272 --> 52:37.501
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

52:37.502 --> 52:41.922
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

52:44.801 --> 52:48.971
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

52:48.972 --> 52:52.223
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

52:52.224 --> 52:54.559
Shim, sham.

52:54.560 --> 52:57.645
Hop over, and shim, sham.

52:57.646 --> 53:01.399
And hop over and shim, sham.

53:01.400 --> 53:05.778
And hop over and... hop over and...

53:05.779 --> 53:09.657
Hop stop. And one, two, three...

53:09.658 --> 53:11.743
Marie!

53:13.454 --> 53:16.372
I'm sorry I'm late. I...
I couldn't get on my bike.

53:16.373 --> 53:18.332
- What's wrong?
- I'm sorry.

53:18.333 --> 53:20.293
- It's OK.
- Marie, what's the matter?

53:20.294 --> 53:24.005
- I couldn't get on my bike.
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

53:24.006 --> 53:26.757
I didn't want to miss the class.

53:26.758 --> 53:28.884
- Marie...
- There's no worries.

53:28.885 --> 53:31.887
Jimmy, get her a chair. Marie,
what happened to your back?

53:31.888 --> 53:36.084
Come on, have a seat.
What's the matter?

53:38.728 --> 53:43.523
"Lay the lash upon their backs."
That's what the Bishop of Galway said.

53:44.525 --> 53:48.820
They make the blood boil, these
hooligans with a cross in their hand.

53:48.821 --> 53:52.783
Closing in like hounds. There's talks
of bringing in the Redemptorists

53:52.784 --> 53:55.785
to preach fire and
thunder for a week.

53:55.953 --> 53:58.662
Father Sheridan came to the shop.

54:00.332 --> 54:03.459
He said... he said he'd
organise a boycott.

54:03.460 --> 54:05.544
- What?
- It's your livelihood.

54:05.545 --> 54:08.922
- He could ruin us.
- What did Brendan say?

54:11.009 --> 54:13.885
He doesn't want me
coming here anymore.

54:16.473 --> 54:21.101
I'm so sorry, but I can't
teach the classes any more.

54:23.355 --> 54:25.356
I'm sorry.

54:25.357 --> 54:28.234
He's after being in the houses
of most of the lads we know.

54:28.235 --> 54:30.151
It's starting to happen
in other parishes.

54:30.152 --> 54:32.237
They're all doing the same thing.

54:32.238 --> 54:34.322
Father Sheridan came
up to see my father,

54:34.323 --> 54:36.782
with the Knights of Saint Columbanus.

54:36.909 --> 54:39.244
They were scheming away.

54:39.245 --> 54:41.913
And they'll have your da and
the fascists on one side,

54:41.914 --> 54:44.833
and the bloody Dohertys
of this world on the other.

54:44.834 --> 54:47.544
At a safe, deniable
distance, you know.

54:47.545 --> 54:53.758
At each other's throats, but only
united by a mutual hatred of us.

54:53.759 --> 54:56.970
We've still got lots
of support out there.

54:56.971 --> 54:58.847
People are stopping me all the time.

54:58.848 --> 55:03.058
And, listen, half those lads in
Fianna Fáil, they think he's a fanatic.

55:03.059 --> 55:05.394
Spit licks who will genuflect
when the time comes.

55:05.395 --> 55:08.981
They're good lads, Sean. And some
of 'em were at the dance here.

55:08.982 --> 55:10.941
My old brigade, most of them.

55:10.942 --> 55:13.485
And the unemployed
movement, they're with us.

55:13.486 --> 55:15.904
Lots of the parents,
they're still solid...

55:15.905 --> 55:20.325
For how long, Tommy?
He called us antichrists!

55:20.326 --> 55:23.287
Look, we need to see it from
his point of view. Right?

55:23.288 --> 55:26.540
We're in his parish,
so he must confront us.

55:26.541 --> 55:30.168
And his fellow priests, bishops
and the entire Catholic community

55:30.169 --> 55:32.963
are all watching him,
so there's pressure on him too.

55:32.964 --> 55:34.797
So we have to get him off our backs,

55:34.798 --> 55:37.841
without him losing face
before his supporters.

55:38.927 --> 55:44.181
What if... What if we ask the Reverend
Father to be on our board of trustees?

55:44.182 --> 55:45.308
Jesus.

55:45.309 --> 55:49.353
We can't be antichrists then.
We've always said everyone's welcome.

55:49.354 --> 55:52.940
If it continues like this, you know,
we'll have an empty hall.

55:52.983 --> 55:57.236
I feel for the lads. There's nothing
for them after all this work.

55:57.237 --> 56:01.908
I'm becoming fed up of being a
pragmatist in church, you know.

56:01.909 --> 56:05.369
Here's this young girl beside me,
she's been beaten because of them,

56:05.370 --> 56:07.121
and she shows up here the next day.

56:07.122 --> 56:09.247
We have to be very careful.

56:09.248 --> 56:14.085
Those people don't just join.
They come to take over.

56:34.857 --> 56:36.483
Holy Moses.

56:36.484 --> 56:39.235
- No, it's only me.
- What do you want?

56:39.236 --> 56:43.155
I've come to get me devil's horns
put on. Is Father Sheridan in?

56:43.156 --> 56:45.198
He is. Come in.

56:50.372 --> 56:51.789
Well, I'll be damned.

56:51.790 --> 56:54.917
Don't lose hope, Father.
There's still time to repent.

56:54.918 --> 56:59.963
Oh, is that so? Well, as you're here,
you might as well come in.

57:09.015 --> 57:12.392
We want to invite you to join our
board of trustees who run the hall.

57:12.393 --> 57:17.188
I'm hopeful that once you come along and
see what we're doing with your own eyes,

57:17.189 --> 57:19.148
we can put all this behind us.

57:19.149 --> 57:23.987
So, I am to be the odd man out among
your, er, hand-picked comrades.

57:23.988 --> 57:27.073
And no doubt when it comes
to choosing reading material,

57:27.074 --> 57:29.993
- there'll be... There'll be a vote?
- Can you not at least...

57:29.994 --> 57:32.036
No, it's a gracious
offering, Mr Gralton.

57:32.037 --> 57:33.871
At a time when a
quarter of the country

57:33.872 --> 57:36.582
is planning to travel to Dublin
for the Eucharistic Congress,

57:36.583 --> 57:41.295
and the other 75 percent will be
tuning into the radio from Athlone,

57:41.296 --> 57:46.133
a country supremely united
in faith, in love and respect,

57:46.134 --> 57:49.302
for Christ's representative on earth.

57:49.554 --> 57:52.055
Have a look at that painting.

57:53.599 --> 57:58.311
Democratic Irish State,
true to its traditions.

57:58.312 --> 57:59.479
In harmony with its people

57:59.480 --> 58:05.068
and under the guidance of the one
true universal Apostolic Church.

58:05.069 --> 58:10.406
That is the natural way.
Now, sit down.

58:12.285 --> 58:16.663
You know my family are
believers. My sister is a nun.

58:16.664 --> 58:21.000
I said the rosary in solidarity with
fighters during the War of Independence.

58:21.001 --> 58:24.211
"Love thy neighbour"
is revered in my book too.

58:24.212 --> 58:27.923
In our hall, we respect freedom
of religion and conscience.

58:27.924 --> 58:31.469
Tell that to the Soviets who have
murdered Christians in their thousands.

58:31.470 --> 58:34.472
And don't get me started on
Joseph Stalin's secret prisons,

58:34.473 --> 58:36.557
and that famine
that's on the horizon.

58:36.558 --> 58:40.728
Don't get me started either, Father.
That is a long debate to be had.

58:40.729 --> 58:44.565
But today, can we talk about the hall
and just listen to what we have to say?

58:44.566 --> 58:47.735
I am not a politician.
No deals in dingy corners.

58:47.736 --> 58:51.237
No half measures.
No compromise. There's no...

58:51.238 --> 58:54.032
A question, please, Reverend Father.

58:54.033 --> 58:58.286
When was the last time you
really listened to someone else?

58:59.371 --> 59:03.165
Actually, it was last
night at confessions.

59:03.167 --> 59:08.004
I listen to the innermost secrets
and fears of our community.

59:08.005 --> 59:13.426
People open their hearts to me.
Not the man, but the priest,

59:13.719 --> 59:18.014
in a way unknown
to your... imagination.

59:18.015 --> 59:20.767
Look at these hands, Father.

59:20.768 --> 59:22.976
Dirt under the fingernails.

59:22.977 --> 59:24.853
I'm no scholar.

59:24.854 --> 59:28.607
I've been a soldier, a sailor,
a docker, a miner,

59:28.608 --> 59:30.943
on the seas and underground.

59:30.944 --> 59:34.779
I've seen much and
made many a mistake,

59:34.781 --> 59:37.741
but despite all our flaws,

59:37.742 --> 59:41.912
I believe in my neighbour,
my fellow man, my class.

59:41.913 --> 59:46.083
Meeting up and struggling to
understand our lives as best we can.

59:46.084 --> 59:50.754
On our own, in isolation, we perish.

59:50.964 --> 59:52.756
The hall is a safe space

59:52.757 --> 59:58.386
where we can think, talk, learn,
listen and laugh and dance.

59:58.387 --> 59:59.846
It's a good place.

59:59.847 --> 01:00:03.390
If I were a believer like you,
I'd call it a holy place.

01:00:03.392 --> 01:00:05.893
It brings out the best in us.

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:09.438
Don't be frightened.
Come along, meet us.

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:12.650
Talk to us, question us,
but work with us.

01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:15.694
There is enough misery
in the world already.

01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:19.448
Oh, you are a believer, Jimmy.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.575
Yes, you are.

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:25.580
And part of me holds you
in very high esteem.

01:00:25.581 --> 01:00:29.875
So, yes, I will come along and
listen to you and your trustees,

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:33.628
once you have brought me
the title deeds to the hall,

01:00:33.629 --> 01:00:37.840
and have them transferred
over to Holy Mother Church.

01:00:42.263 --> 01:00:47.892
I take it back, Father. You do listen,
but only when we're on our knees.

01:01:00.197 --> 01:01:04.658
A flight of Free State aeroplanes
flying in the form of a cross

01:01:04.659 --> 01:01:06.952
escorted the special boat.

01:01:08.997 --> 01:01:12.625
And then Cardinal
Lauri stepped ashore,

01:01:12.626 --> 01:01:18.004
the first Papal Legate to land in
Ireland for over two centuries.

01:01:19.007 --> 01:01:21.550
Accompanied by Mr de Valera
and his ministers...

01:01:22.802 --> 01:01:24.637
he inspected the Guard of Honour,

01:01:24.638 --> 01:01:29.057
followed by his retinue of Vatican
officials in Elizabethan dress.

01:01:29.726 --> 01:01:31.310
The streets along the route

01:01:31.311 --> 01:01:35.563
had been thronged for hours
before the Papal Legate was due,

01:01:35.564 --> 01:01:38.816
and he received a
tumultuous reception.

01:02:21.734 --> 01:02:23.443
Sweeney...

01:02:24.612 --> 01:02:26.446
There's Gralton!

01:02:26.447 --> 01:02:29.783
Mossie Maguire.
Tommy Gilroy. You rats!

01:02:29.784 --> 01:02:32.202
Move on, you fascists.

01:02:32.203 --> 01:02:35.372
- You shouldn't be here.
- Sweeney, get out and let us watch...

01:02:35.373 --> 01:02:37.249
I said get out and let
us watch the film.

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:40.459
- Antichrist!
- Atherton.

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:47.425
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword

01:02:47.426 --> 01:02:49.452
Sing, boys!

01:02:50.053 --> 01:02:53.055
Don't encourage them.
Watch the film, ignore 'em.

01:02:54.308 --> 01:02:57.476
Get out, Sweeney. We've watched
your propaganda, now go home.

01:02:57.477 --> 01:03:00.730
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!

01:03:00.731 --> 01:03:04.900
- We will be true to thee till death
- Thank you.

01:03:04.901 --> 01:03:07.611
We will be true to thee till death

01:03:07.612 --> 01:03:09.280
Yeah, go on. Go on home.

01:03:09.281 --> 01:03:12.907
Get back to your Yankee
friends, you Red bastards!

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:26.755
Whoa there, Dixie. Whoa, whoa.

01:03:26.756 --> 01:03:28.757
- Good man, Mossie.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:03:28.758 --> 01:03:32.927
Mossie, I've left my bike at the hall,
so I'll make my own way home.

01:03:33.346 --> 01:03:36.765
Youse mind yourselves, then.
They'll be looking for us.

01:03:36.766 --> 01:03:39.184
The witch hunt has started.
You two, be careful.

01:03:39.185 --> 01:03:42.270
Likewise. Good luck.
Look after yourselves.

01:03:43.772 --> 01:03:45.314
Get on, Dixie.

01:03:56.785 --> 01:03:58.618
Lock the door.

01:04:11.674 --> 01:04:14.801
- Keep your back turned.
- What?

01:04:35.239 --> 01:04:39.325
- I hope you're not looking.
- I wouldn't dare.

01:04:57.176 --> 01:04:59.344
You can look now.

01:05:09.021 --> 01:05:11.022
Fits perfectly.

01:05:15.194 --> 01:05:17.528
Why wouldn't it?

01:07:53.347 --> 01:07:56.432
You take my breath away.

01:07:59.386 --> 01:08:02.205
I think my heart is going to break.

01:08:34.304 --> 01:08:36.220
Firstly, I just wanted
to thank you all

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:40.224
for agreeing to meet with us today.
It's about a fella called Milmoe.

01:08:40.225 --> 01:08:45.437
Molly, that's the wife, there outside.
Erm, he's in a dire situation.

01:08:46.148 --> 01:08:48.983
He's looking for the
Roscommon IRA to help him.

01:08:48.984 --> 01:08:53.112
He's been forcibly evicted out of
his cottage on the Kingston estate.

01:08:53.656 --> 01:08:57.158
We had an angry meeting
last night, a big split.

01:08:57.158 --> 01:09:00.286
A third of us want to
reinstate him by force.

01:09:00.621 --> 01:09:04.749
A third want nothing to do with it.
And there's a third sitting on the fence.

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:07.251
And he has the best of connections.

01:09:07.252 --> 01:09:10.002
He has the guards. He has the army.

01:09:10.004 --> 01:09:12.506
He has the ranchers
and the politicians.

01:09:12.506 --> 01:09:16.509
Not just the local ones,
but the bigwigs.

01:09:16.636 --> 01:09:19.095
There's some tough
boys on this estate.

01:09:19.096 --> 01:09:21.807
His agent's a vicious bastard.
A bad egg.

01:09:21.808 --> 01:09:24.600
That's a feckin' handful,
all right. Bejaysus, yeah.

01:09:24.602 --> 01:09:27.645
But there's five children out
there on the side of the road,

01:09:27.647 --> 01:09:30.107
and a woman outside this
hall bawling her eyes out,

01:09:30.108 --> 01:09:32.817
unless any of you want
to go out and see her.

01:09:33.194 --> 01:09:36.822
Now... things aren't too
great with ourselves.

01:09:36.823 --> 01:09:39.323
We're not as strong as
what we used to be.

01:09:39.325 --> 01:09:41.950
Truth be told,
there's very few of us.

01:09:42.118 --> 01:09:44.537
Even our OC doesn't even
know we're here today.

01:09:44.537 --> 01:09:47.163
But you know what we know,
what's going on out there.

01:09:47.165 --> 01:09:49.625
There's a queer fear out
there amongst the people,

01:09:49.626 --> 01:09:52.502
and something's going to
have to be done about it.

01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:55.631
So, what do you want from us?

01:09:55.632 --> 01:09:57.800
We need your help to reinstate them.

01:09:57.801 --> 01:10:00.803
There'll be a big turnout
if we can spread the word

01:10:00.804 --> 01:10:04.056
that Jimmy Gralton and his
supporters from Leitrim are coming.

01:10:04.057 --> 01:10:08.477
It isn't just about the reinstatement.
It's much more important than that.

01:10:08.478 --> 01:10:11.147
It's about the message we send
out there to the wider community.

01:10:11.148 --> 01:10:14.899
Think about what could be done.
That's why it's important.

01:10:14.984 --> 01:10:18.236
And that's why it's important,
Jimmy, that you speak to the crowd.

01:10:18.237 --> 01:10:22.073
- Can someone else not speak?
- No, it has to be Jimmy.

01:10:22.074 --> 01:10:24.826
He's got the words,
he's got the spake.

01:10:24.827 --> 01:10:27.829
He's got the confidence and
trust of the people out there,

01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:30.331
and with all due respect
to the rest of you here,

01:10:30.332 --> 01:10:33.084
you wouldn't pull a quarter of
the support of what Jimmy would.

01:10:33.085 --> 01:10:35.503
It has to be Jimmy that speaks.

01:10:36.422 --> 01:10:37.922
What do you think?

01:10:37.923 --> 01:10:42.719
Well, I think that every journalist
from the local press will be there.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:47.181
I think they'll note your words,
which will spread like wildfire,

01:10:47.182 --> 01:10:51.226
and be seen as a direct challenge to
landed estates throughout the country.

01:10:51.227 --> 01:10:53.270
That's why we must win this one.

01:10:53.271 --> 01:10:56.023
Yeah, and why...
and why they need to.

01:10:56.024 --> 01:10:57.733
You know what'll happen, Jimmy.

01:10:57.734 --> 01:11:00.360
It's hard to judge, but...

01:11:00.361 --> 01:11:02.362
they could come after
you again, Jimmy.

01:11:02.363 --> 01:11:05.240
No, there's no "could"
about it, Dessie.

01:11:05.241 --> 01:11:07.534
They will. Of course they will.

01:11:07.535 --> 01:11:10.120
And they'll close down
the hall. It's suicide.

01:11:10.121 --> 01:11:12.873
Well, we don't know
that for certain, Mossie.

01:11:12.874 --> 01:11:15.375
I mean, you know, it's not
the time for pessimism.

01:11:15.376 --> 01:11:18.711
I-I'm not a pessimist. I'm a realist.

01:11:18.712 --> 01:11:21.797
I know the way these bastards are.

01:11:21.882 --> 01:11:28.638
I'm on a, still, on a blacklist, Sean,
for ten years. Ten feckin' years!

01:11:28.639 --> 01:11:32.433
No, I know that and, look,
it's an opportunity.

01:11:32.434 --> 01:11:35.102
Here are five children
out on the street

01:11:35.103 --> 01:11:39.649
from a lord who has thousands of
acres inherited from foreign invasion.

01:11:39.650 --> 01:11:42.068
I mean, who has
the right to the land?

01:11:42.069 --> 01:11:44.904
We know who has the right
to the land. We know that.

01:11:44.905 --> 01:11:47.615
Is it... Is it the
rich man on his own,

01:11:47.616 --> 01:11:50.284
or is it the families that
live and work that land?

01:11:50.285 --> 01:11:54.746
What is the burning issue
up and down this country?

01:11:54.747 --> 01:11:59.251
The breakup of large estates
to landless labourers.

01:11:59.252 --> 01:12:00.752
- D'you know?
- I do.

01:12:00.753 --> 01:12:02.963
I don't think we're gonna
get a better chance.

01:12:02.964 --> 01:12:05.423
- And we shouldn't let it pass.
- That's right.

01:12:05.424 --> 01:12:10.303
This is critical. People are angry.
They're desperate.

01:12:10.304 --> 01:12:14.099
There's no money coming from family
in America because of the Depression.

01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:15.767
We should strike now, James.

01:12:15.768 --> 01:12:17.853
Think before we leap.

01:12:17.854 --> 01:12:20.605
- We forget the bishops at our peril.
- Exactly.

01:12:20.606 --> 01:12:23.650
They've never been stronger
after the Eucharistic Congress.

01:12:23.651 --> 01:12:27.778
You saw the crowds in Dublin.
They've the Government in their pocket.

01:12:27.779 --> 01:12:29.280
They'll go for the kill.

01:12:29.281 --> 01:12:31.156
We have supporters.

01:12:31.157 --> 01:12:35.327
There are thousands of landless
labourers outside these estates.

01:12:35.328 --> 01:12:38.122
The rich are nervous. Fearful.

01:12:38.123 --> 01:12:39.957
We have to keep pushing.

01:12:39.958 --> 01:12:42.835
Ruari's right.
And let me ask you this.

01:12:42.836 --> 01:12:47.631
What is the feckin' point of this hall
if we do not support these people?

01:12:47.632 --> 01:12:50.342
We built this hall
with our own hands.

01:12:50.343 --> 01:12:54.972
We put our lives into it.
Heart and soul. Everything we had.

01:12:54.973 --> 01:13:00.393
It's not just a building,
it's... it's what we are.

01:13:00.394 --> 01:13:02.812
It's everything.
And we have to protect it.

01:13:02.813 --> 01:13:06.065
Not just for ourselves, but for
the youngsters coming after.

01:13:06.066 --> 01:13:10.028
And I know from bitter experience that
if you bite off more than you can chew,

01:13:10.029 --> 01:13:11.487
you'll feckin' choke.

01:13:11.488 --> 01:13:13.573
Exactly.

01:13:13.574 --> 01:13:18.036
I'm sorry, lads,
but that's my fear too.

01:13:18.037 --> 01:13:20.413
It's time for caution.

01:13:20.831 --> 01:13:23.207
My heart goes out to
that woman in the cart.

01:13:23.208 --> 01:13:25.501
They're too strong at the moment.

01:13:25.502 --> 01:13:28.379
They're too wild.
We have to bide our time.

01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:29.671
I agree.

01:13:29.672 --> 01:13:33.091
I don't think Jimmy should talk.
He shouldn't speak this time.

01:13:33.092 --> 01:13:36.219
For Christ's sake, though,
they're coming after us anyway.

01:13:36.262 --> 01:13:38.721
I mean, there's no denying that.

01:13:39.349 --> 01:13:42.517
- I say we support this family.
- Stand together.

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:46.354
Oonagh. You've hardly said a word.

01:14:05.749 --> 01:14:08.167
- Mam.
- Hello, Jimmy.

01:14:17.010 --> 01:14:22.181
Sacred Heart of Jesus, Jimmy, can you
thread this needle for me, please?

01:14:24.518 --> 01:14:28.770
My eyesight is getting so bad,
and I need to mend your shirt.

01:14:38.572 --> 01:14:40.448
- Here.
- Thank you.

01:14:40.449 --> 01:14:44.076
If they drive me out again, Mam,
I want you to come with me.

01:14:45.079 --> 01:14:48.414
I mean it, Mam. I'll find
a place for us both.

01:14:50.710 --> 01:14:54.629
Maybe somewhere easier
to manage. Not so isolated.

01:14:59.427 --> 01:15:01.093
Well?

01:15:03.431 --> 01:15:05.306
What do you think?

01:15:09.227 --> 01:15:12.103
You need a new pair of boots.

01:15:12.272 --> 01:15:15.065
Your other ones are very worn.

01:15:15.650 --> 01:15:18.443
I cleaned them last night.

01:16:02.654 --> 01:16:05.448
Now, there's His Lordship, hmm?

01:16:05.449 --> 01:16:07.533
- He's shaking in his breeches.
- Yeah.

01:16:07.534 --> 01:16:10.035
Fine day for it!

01:16:22.673 --> 01:16:24.216
Come on!

01:16:24.217 --> 01:16:29.887
Come on then, lads. Get in
there and open the doors.

01:16:34.352 --> 01:16:37.562
Get them all off. Quick as you can.

01:16:47.197 --> 01:16:50.658
What's going on here?
This is private property!

01:16:50.659 --> 01:16:52.701
Get off before we call the guards!

01:16:52.702 --> 01:16:55.579
Shush your trap and get
you back to the big house!

01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:57.248
This is my home, my family's home.

01:16:57.249 --> 01:17:00.668
I heard there was loads of room up
in Gralton Hall. Go up there for you.

01:17:00.669 --> 01:17:02.753
No more evictions without just cause.

01:17:02.754 --> 01:17:05.506
All these people are going
to jail, I promise you that!

01:17:05.507 --> 01:17:08.258
Go back!

01:17:08.718 --> 01:17:13.221
Down on your knees!
Get on your knees!

01:17:16.226 --> 01:17:21.896
If you... If you or your earl or
anyone lays a hand on this family,

01:17:21.897 --> 01:17:24.274
you'll get what's coming to you.
Do you hear me?

01:17:24.275 --> 01:17:27.193
You're to leave these people
in peace in their own home!

01:17:27.194 --> 01:17:30.113
- You won't get away with this.
- I will get away with it.

01:17:33.367 --> 01:17:36.744
There's to be no more
evictions on this estate!

01:17:39.206 --> 01:17:42.542
Come on, put the rest of the stuff
back into this house. Come on.

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:55.428
A chairde!

01:17:55.805 --> 01:17:59.641
I want to introduce to you
a man whom all of us know,

01:17:59.642 --> 01:18:03.269
whom all of us trust and
have confidence in.

01:18:03.605 --> 01:18:06.273
Jimmy Gralton, come up
here and say a few words.

01:18:06.274 --> 01:18:07.834
Go on, Jimmy.

01:18:13.656 --> 01:18:16.282
Friends, comrades.

01:18:17.118 --> 01:18:22.288
Who could not appreciate the
magnificence of the mansion we passed?

01:18:22.289 --> 01:18:25.749
Fertile land as far
as the eye can see.

01:18:25.834 --> 01:18:29.420
And the simplicity of this cottage.

01:18:29.421 --> 01:18:31.589
The Earl snaps his fingers,

01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:34.675
and our brother and sister
here and their five children

01:18:34.676 --> 01:18:36.427
are thrown onto the street.

01:18:37.804 --> 01:18:42.141
This is the greatest lie they
try to stuff down our throats,

01:18:42.142 --> 01:18:45.978
that Ireland is one,
that our nation is one,

01:18:45.979 --> 01:18:48.022
and that we are all one people,

01:18:48.023 --> 01:18:51.483
united in our beliefs
with one common interest.

01:18:52.694 --> 01:18:56.029
But do you think the interests
of a child in the slum

01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:59.198
are the same as the
rack-renting landlord?

01:18:59.617 --> 01:19:03.161
Do you think the interests of a
labourer are the same as the Earl's?

01:19:03.162 --> 01:19:04.454
No.

01:19:04.455 --> 01:19:07.624
The interests of a miner
or a factory worker

01:19:07.625 --> 01:19:12.045
the same as the owner's, his bankers',
his lawyers', his investors'

01:19:12.046 --> 01:19:15.632
and the prostitute journalists'
hired to write their lies?

01:19:15.633 --> 01:19:17.050
Some here today.

01:19:17.051 --> 01:19:21.221
Do you think they give
a damn about our old,

01:19:21.222 --> 01:19:24.641
the sick, the unemployed,
the hungry, the homeless,

01:19:24.642 --> 01:19:28.852
and those forced to leave our
shores desperate for work?

01:19:29.354 --> 01:19:32.898
I saw the '20s in New York,
with my own eyes,

01:19:32.899 --> 01:19:37.653
and the wild speculation and
greed that infected everyone.

01:19:37.654 --> 01:19:40.030
And then I saw the bubble burst.

01:19:40.031 --> 01:19:44.576
The crash of '29 and misery
in a land of plenty.

01:19:44.577 --> 01:19:47.746
Let's not forget how it
spread round the world,

01:19:47.747 --> 01:19:52.710
from a system steeped in illusion,
exploitation and avarice.

01:19:52.711 --> 01:19:58.549
They tried to pretend that it
was destiny or an act of God,

01:19:58.550 --> 01:20:00.550
but it was all man-made.

01:20:02.386 --> 01:20:06.389
We need to take control
of our lives again.

01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:09.559
Work for need, not for greed.

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:14.731
And not just to survive like a dog,
but to live and to celebrate.

01:20:14.732 --> 01:20:15.857
Yes!

01:20:15.858 --> 01:20:21.237
And to dance, to sing,
as free human beings.

01:20:24.033 --> 01:20:26.575
Now, on you go into your home.

01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:25.257
Everybody down! Everybody down!

01:21:26.468 --> 01:21:28.803
Everybody down! Get down!

01:21:28.804 --> 01:21:30.471
- Stay down!
- Everybody down!

01:21:30.472 --> 01:21:34.016
Stay down everyone.
Keep your heads down.

01:21:34.017 --> 01:21:36.268
Everybody's fine.

01:21:36.269 --> 01:21:38.144
Anyone hurt?

01:21:38.145 --> 01:21:40.355
Stay where you are,
stay where you are.

01:21:40.356 --> 01:21:42.440
Keep your heads down!

01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:46.653
Stay down, stay down, stay down.

01:21:46.654 --> 01:21:48.874
Is everyone all right?

01:21:48.876 --> 01:21:51.057
Now you're gonna have
to watch your back.

01:21:55.704 --> 01:21:58.039
Now it's started, Jimmy.

01:21:58.874 --> 01:22:01.167
Cowardly bastards.

01:22:03.544 --> 01:22:06.672
Is that a truck driving off,
you hear that?

01:22:07.842 --> 01:22:12.552
I see no lights, but I'm sure that was a
truck driving off there. D'you hear it?

01:22:13.513 --> 01:22:17.015
- I can't be sure.
- Bastards!

01:22:17.851 --> 01:22:19.685
Cowards, huh?

01:22:19.686 --> 01:22:23.521
The hall's full of
women and children.

01:22:57.181 --> 01:22:59.515
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

01:22:59.516 --> 01:23:02.935
It is over 25 years since
my last confession.

01:23:02.936 --> 01:23:05.897
I would like your advice on what
to do with the Pharisees who,

01:23:05.898 --> 01:23:08.900
from the safe distance of
the pulpit, have told lies,

01:23:08.901 --> 01:23:12.278
incited hatred and
encouraged the rifle squad

01:23:12.279 --> 01:23:15.113
to attack and endanger the
lives of innocent people.

01:23:15.114 --> 01:23:16.948
What are you talking about?

01:23:16.949 --> 01:23:19.284
I would like your advice
on the sin of pride,

01:23:19.285 --> 01:23:22.078
on those who assume they are
the fount of all knowledge,

01:23:22.079 --> 01:23:25.123
and yet do nothing but promote
ignorance and superstition.

01:23:25.124 --> 01:23:26.917
Do you want confession?

01:23:26.918 --> 01:23:29.878
And those who try to destroy
what is best in us,

01:23:29.879 --> 01:23:33.798
our imagination, our sense of fun,
by threats of damnation.

01:23:33.799 --> 01:23:39.095
But worst of all, those who try to kill
our spirit by their miserable drabness,

01:23:39.096 --> 01:23:43.475
who have such venom in their hearts
for everything they cannot control.

01:23:43.476 --> 01:23:45.936
Gralton, this is a sacrilege.

01:23:45.937 --> 01:23:49.730
No, I'll tell you what the
sacrilege is, Reverend Father.

01:23:49.773 --> 01:23:53.108
Having more hate in
your heart than love.

01:24:01.451 --> 01:24:03.285
Goodnight, Mary.

01:24:03.954 --> 01:24:06.789
Can I ask you something,
Father Seamus?

01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:08.749
You can, of course.

01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:11.669
Do you think Father
Sheridan is his usual self?

01:24:11.670 --> 01:24:16.131
It's Gralton.
He's obsessed with the man.

01:24:17.133 --> 01:24:20.510
Oh, don't worry about it,
Mary. Goodnight.

01:24:20.511 --> 01:24:22.344
Goodnight.

01:24:49.665 --> 01:24:51.373
Come in.

01:24:52.001 --> 01:24:53.958
Have a wee drop.

01:25:02.135 --> 01:25:03.968
There you are.

01:25:04.554 --> 01:25:06.513
Sláinte.

01:25:06.848 --> 01:25:08.807
Sláinte.

01:25:11.728 --> 01:25:14.395
What's wrong with that, huh?

01:25:17.567 --> 01:25:21.194
You know, that's the
voice of a black woman.

01:25:21.195 --> 01:25:22.737
Yeah.

01:25:23.364 --> 01:25:25.739
Quite remarkable, huh?

01:25:29.077 --> 01:25:31.578
Oh, Gralton came today.

01:25:32.039 --> 01:25:36.208
He had the nerve to leave these
records outside in the porch.

01:25:36.209 --> 01:25:39.045
And he had the guts to
face me in the confessional.

01:25:39.046 --> 01:25:42.214
D'you know what he said? Hmm?

01:25:42.716 --> 01:25:48.720
He said, "You have more hate
in your heart than love."

01:25:50.182 --> 01:25:52.516
What do you make of that?

01:26:51.449 --> 01:26:57.120
Will it be you next, son?
I'm so worried for you.

01:27:32.281 --> 01:27:38.159
Listen, what you've learned is in your
heads forever. They can't destroy that.

01:28:00.516 --> 01:28:02.016
Thank you.

01:28:02.351 --> 01:28:06.521
These are the tactics of the
Ku Klux Klan. No, thank you.

01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:11.859
Cowardice, sneaking around
in the middle of the night.

01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:14.653
Strikes me they were
keen to avoid loss of life.

01:28:14.654 --> 01:28:16.488
Thank you.

01:28:19.993 --> 01:28:22.161
- Sláinte.
- Sláinte.

01:28:22.162 --> 01:28:24.329
To the business ahead.

01:28:25.207 --> 01:28:27.833
So, have they found the culprits yet?

01:28:27.834 --> 01:28:31.128
As you know, Father, Gralton had
quite a few enemies in the locality.

01:28:31.129 --> 01:28:33.005
He had a lot of friends, too,

01:28:33.006 --> 01:28:35.549
despite our best efforts.

01:28:35.717 --> 01:28:38.344
It's disgusting behaviour.
What are we gonna do next?

01:28:38.345 --> 01:28:41.721
Are we gonna burn down the
cottage with the old woman inside?

01:28:41.722 --> 01:28:44.641
Make no mistake, it's a
disaster for the community.

01:28:44.642 --> 01:28:47.894
And we'll all be the
losers because of it.

01:28:47.895 --> 01:28:50.396
It would be a tragedy if we
turned him into a martyr.

01:28:50.397 --> 01:28:51.898
That would be a huge mistake.

01:28:51.899 --> 01:28:53.900
It'd be a tragedy for a decent man

01:28:53.901 --> 01:28:58.571
to get shot in the back and
lose his life, Mr O'Keefe!

01:28:59.365 --> 01:29:01.366
"Is it Christ or Gralton?"

01:29:01.367 --> 01:29:04.327
I think those were the words
of several parish priests...

01:29:04.328 --> 01:29:06.079
I suspect if Christ was here today,

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:08.039
there'd be several
members of this parish

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:11.417
who would have Him crucified again.
That's what I suspect!

01:29:11.418 --> 01:29:15.879
Cut out the nonsense. I expect
he'll scamper away sooner or later.

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:19.508
He's a bloody communist.
They don't scamper like you lot.

01:29:19.509 --> 01:29:23.387
They might make a tactical retreat,
but they'll fight till their last breath.

01:29:23.388 --> 01:29:27.182
Look what they're doing
in Belfast. This is incredible.

01:29:27.183 --> 01:29:31.103
Read that. "The Falls
and Shankill Unite."

01:29:31.104 --> 01:29:35.565
Stirring up fraternity between poor
Catholics and unemployed Protestants.

01:29:36.025 --> 01:29:39.194
I'm not clear. Is that a good
thing now or a bad thing?

01:29:39.195 --> 01:29:41.113
20,000 strikers.

01:29:41.114 --> 01:29:43.782
They even fought against
police issued with 800 rifles.

01:29:43.783 --> 01:29:47.952
Two killed, Father, and 70 injured.
Over 100,000 on the streets.

01:29:47.953 --> 01:29:50.872
Protestants and Catholics
united at the funerals.

01:29:50.873 --> 01:29:55.626
Workers challenging the leaders of
their own trade unions as sell-outs.

01:29:55.627 --> 01:29:58.129
- That's the Reds for you.
- No, that's poverty!

01:29:58.130 --> 01:30:01.757
- Don't be so goddamn naive!
- Calm down, gentlemen.

01:30:01.758 --> 01:30:03.467
I apologise for raising my voice.

01:30:03.468 --> 01:30:07.888
Speaking of Belfast. Tom Mann.

01:30:08.599 --> 01:30:11.475
And what's he got to do
with us and our problem?

01:30:20.776 --> 01:30:23.444
Mr Gralton. You're under arrest.

01:30:23.988 --> 01:30:25.572
What for?

01:30:25.573 --> 01:30:29.409
I've an order here signed
personally by a member of Cabinet.

01:30:29.410 --> 01:30:33.830
You are to be deported from the country,
forthwith, as an illegal alien.

01:30:33.831 --> 01:30:36.583
Illegal alien? Have you
been drinking, officer?

01:30:36.584 --> 01:30:38.793
- Watch your mouth.
- An alien?

01:30:38.794 --> 01:30:39.961
Sorry, Mrs Gralton.

01:30:39.962 --> 01:30:43.089
He was born in this house.
He's my son.

01:30:43.090 --> 01:30:45.425
He also holds an American
passport, Mrs Gralton.

01:30:45.426 --> 01:30:47.343
Let me see that.

01:30:48.137 --> 01:30:50.263
This is terrible.

01:30:50.264 --> 01:30:52.764
- All the way from Dublin?
- It is.

01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:55.600
Minister of Justice.

01:30:58.188 --> 01:30:59.605
What date is the hearing?

01:30:59.606 --> 01:31:03.359
There'll be no hearing for you,
Mr Gralton. It's a deportation order.

01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.861
- He's not a criminal.
- Come on.

01:31:05.862 --> 01:31:07.988
No, you can't take my son.

01:31:07.989 --> 01:31:10.991
I'm sorry, Mrs Gralton,
we're under strict instructions.

01:31:10.992 --> 01:31:13.369
Sorry, we're under strict
instructions to take him in.

01:31:13.370 --> 01:31:17.039
Well, let him change his jacket.
And let me say goodbye to my son.

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:18.665
You have two minutes.

01:31:30.552 --> 01:31:32.553
Get up those stairs
and watch that door.

01:31:32.554 --> 01:31:34.346
Yes, sir.

01:31:36.684 --> 01:31:40.186
I've made some tea.
You're welcome to a tea.

01:31:40.729 --> 01:31:42.521
Thanks, Mrs Gralton.

01:31:57.245 --> 01:32:00.330
Mrs Gralton, I remember
when I was a young fella,

01:32:00.331 --> 01:32:03.249
you used to bring books
round our school.

01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:06.378
- What school was that?
- Sacred Heart.

01:32:06.379 --> 01:32:09.381
It was the best part of the month.
We all looked forward to that.

01:32:09.382 --> 01:32:11.842
Treasure Island, now,
was my favourite.

01:32:11.843 --> 01:32:15.387
Robert Louis Stevenson.
It was always very popular.

01:32:15.388 --> 01:32:18.348
I always liked White Fang meself.

01:32:21.519 --> 01:32:25.438
What's going on, son?
What's going on here?

01:32:26.399 --> 01:32:32.194
We were told that the British deported
a fella in Belfast called Tom Mann,

01:32:32.195 --> 01:32:37.116
some English trade union
activist over to agitate,

01:32:37.117 --> 01:32:40.286
start a general strike after
those workers were shot.

01:32:40.287 --> 01:32:44.206
No trial? That's some "fair play".

01:32:44.207 --> 01:32:48.919
So somebody can be taken away
from their own home without a trial

01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:51.129
or being allowed to have a say?

01:32:51.630 --> 01:32:53.631
Mr Gralton!

01:32:54.133 --> 01:32:56.635
Mr Gralton. Are you ready yet?

01:32:56.970 --> 01:32:58.595
Get up there.

01:32:58.930 --> 01:33:01.097
What's going on?

01:33:01.098 --> 01:33:03.600
- Door's jammed.
- Then break it down.

01:33:03.601 --> 01:33:05.810
It's stuck. He's got something...

01:33:05.811 --> 01:33:08.563
Put your back into it,
it's only a small door.

01:33:11.233 --> 01:33:13.651
He's gone through the feckin' thatch!

01:33:13.652 --> 01:33:15.945
What do you mean he's gone?

01:33:16.489 --> 01:33:19.074
There he is! He's off
across the fields!

01:33:19.075 --> 01:33:20.992
Jesus' sake!

01:33:21.410 --> 01:33:23.161
Shower of useless bastards!

01:33:23.162 --> 01:33:26.455
I'm gonna get youse
all fired, I swear.

01:33:28.667 --> 01:33:30.335
Where's the key, Mrs Gralton?

01:33:30.336 --> 01:33:32.754
I don't know.
Don't know where I put it.

01:33:32.755 --> 01:33:35.672
Oh, shite! Smash it through!

01:33:37.509 --> 01:33:38.675
Feckin' door!

01:33:38.676 --> 01:33:41.178
- Please, Mrs Gralton.
- I don't know where I put it.

01:33:41.179 --> 01:33:44.014
- They'll have our guts for garters!
- I can't help that.

01:33:44.015 --> 01:33:46.141
Come on! Get yourself through.

01:33:46.142 --> 01:33:48.685
- What's going on here?
- Breathe in.

01:33:48.686 --> 01:33:51.105
- What's going on here?
- The feckin' door is locked!

01:33:51.106 --> 01:33:53.107
- Where's the key?
- Down her drawers!

01:33:53.108 --> 01:33:56.693
He's out the back,
he went through the roof.

01:33:56.694 --> 01:34:00.155
You get after him, you gobshite!
He's round the back!

01:34:00.156 --> 01:34:02.198
Get after him, would you?

01:34:03.368 --> 01:34:06.035
Get up, you eejit, and get
after him, for God's sake.

01:34:06.036 --> 01:34:07.370
Will I pull you out, sir?

01:34:07.371 --> 01:34:11.206
What are you coming back to me for?
You should be going after him!

01:34:28.559 --> 01:34:31.686
Sean Maguire! Come out, Sean Maguire!

01:34:31.687 --> 01:34:34.981
Get out of my fucking house!
What the hell are you doing?

01:34:34.982 --> 01:34:37.567
- Get out! Get out!
- Out you come.

01:34:37.568 --> 01:34:40.068
Jesus Christ! Bastards!

01:34:40.069 --> 01:34:43.989
- Where's Jimmy? Where's Jimmy Gralton?
- Get off me!

01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:46.199
- Get off me!
- Put your hands up!

01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:49.202
- God, you fuckers!
- Get the cuffs on him.

01:34:49.704 --> 01:34:51.329
- House empty.
- Fuck.

01:34:51.330 --> 01:34:53.248
- Where's Jimmy, Sean?
- I don't fucking know!

01:34:53.249 --> 01:34:55.041
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

01:34:55.042 --> 01:34:57.335
Get off me! You're hurting me!

01:34:57.336 --> 01:35:00.547
Get out! Stay away from my children!

01:35:00.548 --> 01:35:02.174
You stay away from my children!

01:35:02.175 --> 01:35:04.342
Come out, Mossie!

01:35:05.678 --> 01:35:07.429
- Get out!
- Where is he?

01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:09.598
- Where's who?
- Where's Gralton?

01:35:09.599 --> 01:35:13.684
What's going on?
Leave him alone. Leave him alone!

01:35:13.685 --> 01:35:17.104
He's away in Dublin
having a pint with de Valera!

01:35:53.057 --> 01:35:55.266
- Whoa.
- Ah, Tommy Gilroy.

01:35:55.267 --> 01:35:56.768
Whoa, Dixie. Whoa.

01:35:56.769 --> 01:35:59.479
Stop there now. We're gonna
have a look around, OK?

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:01.606
That's fine.
What are you looking for?

01:36:01.607 --> 01:36:04.275
- What is it you're looking for?
- What's in the hay, Tommy?

01:36:04.276 --> 01:36:06.611
- How are you, Tommy?
- Doherty.

01:36:06.612 --> 01:36:09.489
- Where's Gralton, Tommy?
- I don't know where Gralton is.

01:36:09.490 --> 01:36:12.909
Leave my hay alone. You won't find
him in there, whatever you do.

01:36:12.910 --> 01:36:15.245
- Sweeney, let me away up the road.
- What's your rush?

01:36:15.246 --> 01:36:19.414
I have no rush. I'm just trying to do a
man's job and just take me hay home.

01:36:19.415 --> 01:36:22.501
I don't have James Gralton.
Let me away up the road, Sweeney!

01:36:26.965 --> 01:36:30.342
Gentlemen. Sean, great to see you.

01:36:30.343 --> 01:36:33.178
- You all right?
- Aye. Hanging in there.

01:36:33.179 --> 01:36:35.263
I'm freezing.

01:36:37.934 --> 01:36:41.102
There's some eggs there.
Bread and milk.

01:36:42.146 --> 01:36:44.355
Good man.

01:36:45.483 --> 01:36:50.694
- You're still in one piece anyway.
- Still breathing.

01:37:20.809 --> 01:37:22.725
We're here now.

01:37:34.155 --> 01:37:38.366
The town hall was packed for
the meeting. Two to a seat.

01:37:38.534 --> 01:37:42.412
We presented the letters of support
from around the country first.

01:37:42.413 --> 01:37:46.916
But what really infuriated them
were the petitions from America.

01:37:46.917 --> 01:37:49.210
The Mayor was there all puffed up,

01:37:49.211 --> 01:37:53.839
and one eejit talked about a communist
plot to nationalise women and children.

01:37:55.425 --> 01:37:57.384
They didn't want to let
your mother speak,

01:37:57.385 --> 01:38:01.513
but the gallery started chanting
"fair play", so they gave in.

01:38:04.267 --> 01:38:07.227
Her hands were shaking
holding her notes.

01:38:07.395 --> 01:38:10.021
But her voice was steady.

01:38:10.357 --> 01:38:12.941
You should have seen
the look in her eye.

01:38:16.946 --> 01:38:20.448
"What can a mother say
when about to lose a son?

01:38:21.242 --> 01:38:25.370
"Part of me wants to scream
again as in childbirth,

01:38:25.538 --> 01:38:29.624
"and part of me wants to
ask 'What is his crime? '.

01:38:29.625 --> 01:38:32.960
"Why is an old tin hall so dangerous?

01:38:34.421 --> 01:38:36.923
"Am I to blame for giving him books,

01:38:36.924 --> 01:38:40.134
"teaching the boy to
think and ask questions?

01:38:41.970 --> 01:38:46.473
"He brought back the world which
he had seen to the hall he built.

01:38:46.934 --> 01:38:48.559
"Is that the crime?

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:52.897
"If we can take a man from
his home without a trial,

01:38:52.898 --> 01:38:56.066
"send him off because
of what is in his head.

01:38:57.945 --> 01:39:02.822
"I may lose my child,
but Ireland loses much, much more."

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:06.159
The gallery cheered.

01:39:07.453 --> 01:39:09.787
The Council ignored her.

01:39:11.207 --> 01:39:14.918
They took the letters of support
and they burned them outside.

01:39:17.088 --> 01:39:20.214
All those meetings up
and down the country.

01:39:21.175 --> 01:39:26.095
The truth is, your support is confined
to the trade unions and usual friends.

01:39:26.431 --> 01:39:29.766
The IRA are even on the fence.
They don't want to upset the Church.

01:39:29.767 --> 01:39:32.100
And the deportation stands.

01:39:34.479 --> 01:39:37.022
Father Seamus came to see me.

01:39:37.023 --> 01:39:39.859
He fears it'll turn the
youth against the Church.

01:39:39.860 --> 01:39:42.445
I prefer the Sheridans.

01:39:42.446 --> 01:39:45.364
At least he has the courage
of his convictions.

01:39:45.365 --> 01:39:49.076
He said he'd go over Sheridan's
head to talk to the bishop.

01:39:49.077 --> 01:39:51.954
He'd even go to Dublin
to try and make peace.

01:39:52.747 --> 01:39:54.498
If?

01:39:55.125 --> 01:39:57.668
If you promised not to
build the hall again.

01:39:59.004 --> 01:40:02.047
And lived a quiet, private life.

01:40:31.118 --> 01:40:33.661
A quiet, private life.

01:40:35.206 --> 01:40:37.247
With you, Oonagh.

01:40:43.755 --> 01:40:47.257
I wish with all my heart
we had another life to live.

01:40:52.430 --> 01:40:57.434
Jimmy, they've drafted in
more soldiers. By the dozen.

01:40:58.353 --> 01:41:01.146
It's only a matter of time.

01:41:02.190 --> 01:41:04.482
God, this hurts so much.

01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:13.198
These are our last
moments, I know it.

01:41:14.868 --> 01:41:17.411
I'm never gonna see you again.

01:41:50.945 --> 01:41:52.404
Gardai! Gardai!

01:41:52.405 --> 01:41:54.823
Don't move, Jimmy,
don't move! Don't move!

01:41:54.824 --> 01:41:58.285
We have you now, you dirty bastard, ya!
We have you now, boy!

01:41:58.286 --> 01:42:02.122
We have you now, Jimmy!
There'll be no getting away this time!

01:42:02.123 --> 01:42:05.291
Let him stand up.

01:42:06.210 --> 01:42:08.377
Come on now. Out.

01:42:08.921 --> 01:42:12.131
What's going on here?
Get out of my house!

01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:24.351
We're nearly done here. Thanks.

01:42:25.145 --> 01:42:28.480
Three pounds, nine shillings and
thrupence ha'penny, Sergeant.

01:42:28.481 --> 01:42:30.899
- Is that all you have?
- Aye.

01:42:31.651 --> 01:42:34.278
And the good news is
we don't confiscate it.

01:42:34.279 --> 01:42:37.572
The bad news is it'll be going
towards paying your fare.

01:42:46.582 --> 01:42:48.791
So, how did you find me?

01:43:01.221 --> 01:43:03.348
Can I visit my mother to say goodbye?

01:43:03.349 --> 01:43:05.016
Not a hope in hell.

01:43:05.017 --> 01:43:07.685
She's frail. My last
chance to see her.

01:43:07.686 --> 01:43:11.939
I've strict orders to get you out of
here and before the riff-raff come.

01:43:13.233 --> 01:43:16.361
- Where are you taking me?
- You're going straight to Cork,

01:43:16.362 --> 01:43:19.029
and then to Cobh where we
have a ship waiting for you.

01:43:26.079 --> 01:43:28.955
Should have kept your big
mouth shut, Gralton.

01:43:28.956 --> 01:43:32.542
You always had to be cock of the walk.
You had this coming to you.

01:43:32.543 --> 01:43:35.253
Can I have a sheet of paper
to write her a note?

01:43:35.254 --> 01:43:37.673
Save your tears for the crossing.

01:43:37.674 --> 01:43:40.258
There's a fine postal
service from New York.

01:43:40.385 --> 01:43:42.385
There he is.

01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:51.686
- There's the bollocks!
- You antichrist!

01:43:51.687 --> 01:43:53.896
You won't set foot in our land again!

01:43:53.897 --> 01:43:56.690
Good riddance to you
Gralton, you Red bastard.

01:43:57.984 --> 01:44:00.611
You're like Charlie
Chaplin with a jacket on.

01:44:00.612 --> 01:44:04.615
This'll cheer you up. The ship waiting
for you is called the Britannic.

01:44:04.616 --> 01:44:07.743
Please. Please!
Show the man some respect!

01:44:07.744 --> 01:44:11.580
He has more courage and decency
than all of you put together.

01:44:23.844 --> 01:44:26.344
- Jimmy!
- Jimmy!

01:44:27.722 --> 01:44:29.347
- Marie.
- Jimmy!

01:44:29.348 --> 01:44:32.892
- Jimmy!
- Marie! Stay where you are!

01:44:33.519 --> 01:44:36.646
- Jimmy!
- Jimmy!

01:44:40.735 --> 01:44:44.112
- Jimmy!
- Jimmy!

01:44:44.113 --> 01:44:46.781
- Get back, you little fecker!
- Get back!

01:44:46.782 --> 01:44:49.408
Go on, clear off!

01:44:55.875 --> 01:44:57.958
- Clear off, the lot of you!
- Jimmy!

01:44:57.959 --> 01:45:00.335
Clear off!

01:45:00.754 --> 01:45:03.213
You're under arrest for kidnap!

01:45:04.716 --> 01:45:07.134
Get off the road or
we'll run you over.

01:45:07.135 --> 01:45:08.594
Go home!

01:45:08.595 --> 01:45:11.304
Get off the road. Get off the road!

01:45:13.266 --> 01:45:14.683
Get away from him.

01:45:14.684 --> 01:45:17.978
- Don't let the bastards get you!
- We won't stop dancing.

01:45:17.979 --> 01:45:21.690
- Don't forget to send us more records.
- We'll keep dancing and dreaming.

01:45:21.691 --> 01:45:24.651
I'm gonna teach my daughter
the shim sham. We'll miss you.

01:45:24.652 --> 01:45:28.046
- You'll write to us?
- I'll send you back money for a party.

01:45:28.775 --> 01:45:29.864
Get this truck going.

01:45:29.865 --> 01:45:32.867
- You're a good man, Jimmy!
- Don't forget us, Jimmy.

01:45:32.868 --> 01:45:36.329
- You won't forget us, Jimmy, will you?
- Drive over 'em!

01:45:36.330 --> 01:45:39.207
Get off the road!
Get off the road! Get off the road!

01:45:39.208 --> 01:45:41.042
Get off!

01:45:41.043 --> 01:45:43.502
You don't deserve this, Jimmy!

01:45:47.174 --> 01:45:49.008
Go on, Jimmy.

01:45:53.722 --> 01:45:58.726
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain

01:45:58.727 --> 01:46:03.814
I wish I had my heart again

01:46:03.815 --> 01:46:09.945
And vainly think I'd not complain

01:46:09.946 --> 01:46:17.535
Is go dté tú mo mhúirnín slán

01:46:18.204 --> 01:46:23.834
Siúil, siúil, siúil a rúin

01:46:23.835 --> 01:46:29.714
Siúil go socair agus siúil go ciúin

01:46:29.715 --> 01:46:35.636
Siúil go doras agus éalaigh liúm

01:46:35.637 --> 01:46:44.394
Is go dté tú mo mhúirnín slán
