00:06.583 --> 00:09.500
Let me tell you an idea I had for a game.

00:09.583 --> 00:14.083
A nerdy guy falls in love with a princess.
A warrior princess.

00:14.791 --> 00:15.875
A heroine.

00:17.125 --> 00:20.958
The characters will face challenges
until they can be together.

00:21.041 --> 00:24.833
Just like me and Eva.
I lived in São Paulo. She lived in Bahia.

00:24.916 --> 00:29.333
But I knew I wanted to marry her
ever since we first met.

00:30.916 --> 00:31.833
Sorry, bro.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.041
Are you hurt?

00:34.125 --> 00:37.208
-My body isn't, but my ego is shattered.
-Are you okay?

00:37.291 --> 00:39.250
-Guys, please.
-There's no need.

00:39.333 --> 00:41.041
-Could someone clean up?
-I'll do it.

00:42.041 --> 00:42.916
Of course not.

00:46.375 --> 00:47.375
Eva…

00:48.875 --> 00:51.208
I'm Alex. Nice to meet you.

00:51.875 --> 00:52.875
You too, Alex.

00:55.083 --> 00:56.583
What's your table?

00:57.500 --> 00:58.458
That one.

01:00.625 --> 01:02.375
Everyone got promoted.

01:03.291 --> 01:04.833
You don't seem so happy.

01:04.916 --> 01:06.708
I don't like my job that much.

01:07.750 --> 01:08.958
Then quit.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.708
True success is doing what you love.

01:17.041 --> 01:21.083
Did he say that?
That he wanted to marry me the day we met?

01:22.375 --> 01:25.875
Alex is the only one silly enough
to believe in love at first sight.

01:25.958 --> 01:28.125
I didn't even know
I wanted to get married.

01:28.208 --> 01:31.583
I always thought there was so much more
to accomplish before that.

01:33.708 --> 01:36.500
But I was sure I wanted to be near him.

01:38.250 --> 01:40.458
And you didn't believe
in long-distance love.

01:41.750 --> 01:42.958
You didn't either.

01:53.416 --> 01:56.166
But it's true. Long-distance is the worst.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.833
-I don't get it.
-I have to tell you something.

02:01.500 --> 02:02.333
No.

02:03.958 --> 02:04.791
No.

02:07.416 --> 02:08.250
No.

02:11.791 --> 02:13.708
You're not telling me you're…

02:14.500 --> 02:15.375
I am.

02:16.083 --> 02:17.125
Are you…

02:17.750 --> 02:19.291
I'm going to São Paulo!

02:21.250 --> 02:23.708
I wanted a big, fat wedding.

02:23.791 --> 02:26.416
A big party,
friends going crazy on the dance floor,

02:26.500 --> 02:29.166
families being cringey and, of course,

02:29.666 --> 02:32.500
Eva walking down the aisle
in the most gorgeous dress

02:32.583 --> 02:35.000
so we could be together forever.

02:39.291 --> 02:41.708
So, what do you think?

02:46.541 --> 02:48.208
I love it!

02:50.416 --> 02:52.625
-And I saw how much you've worked on it.
-Yeah.

02:52.708 --> 02:53.708
And there it is.

02:54.291 --> 02:55.416
It's done.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.666
It's a playable demo.
All I need is a company to invest in it.

02:59.541 --> 03:01.750
You're impossible to say "no" to.

03:03.791 --> 03:04.916
Close your eyes.

03:05.000 --> 03:05.916
Close them.

03:06.875 --> 03:08.541
Oh, what is it?

03:12.083 --> 03:12.916
Open them.

03:13.916 --> 03:15.375
Wow, look.

03:15.458 --> 03:18.666
Careful, I don't know
what that monster's hiding there.

03:25.791 --> 03:26.708
Eva,

03:28.458 --> 03:29.750
will you marry me?

03:34.583 --> 03:35.708
Of course I will.

03:37.208 --> 03:38.833
You nerd.

03:55.416 --> 03:59.333
And that's the story of the day
that my dream would come true.

03:59.416 --> 04:01.500
Sorry to be a buzzkill, folks.

04:01.583 --> 04:06.291
It was Alex's dream,
but guess who was planning everything?

04:11.791 --> 04:15.833
This is where my daughter
is getting married, look.

04:15.916 --> 04:16.958
MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

04:17.041 --> 04:19.125
At the family resort,

04:19.625 --> 04:24.750
which she's transformed into a charming
and popular chain like this one.

04:24.833 --> 04:28.166
And let me tell you something,
they're all over Brazil.

04:28.250 --> 04:30.708
That's Evinha. She's spunky.

04:36.833 --> 04:38.041
Everyone loves Alex.

04:38.125 --> 04:39.458
FATHER OF THE GROOM
MOTHER OF THE GROOM

04:39.541 --> 04:43.541
Alex is in control
of his time and his life.

04:43.625 --> 04:45.708
And this wedding will be wonderful.

04:45.791 --> 04:50.541
Plus, our family will hit the road
just like the old days.

04:50.625 --> 04:51.708
Oh, no.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.041
I'm going first to help plan it.
Eva insisted.

04:54.125 --> 04:56.958
No, she didn't, Carina.
You're just a meddler.

04:57.041 --> 04:59.291
I'm not a meddler. In fact, I'm helpful.

04:59.375 --> 05:01.875
-That's not meddling.
-Let's try this again.

05:02.875 --> 05:04.291
Alexizito and Evinha!

05:04.375 --> 05:05.208
FRIEND OF THE GROOM

05:05.291 --> 05:07.291
What can I say about this power couple?

05:07.375 --> 05:08.791
Marriage is the victory of love.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.375
SISTER OF THE BRIDE
FATHER OF THE BRIDE

05:10.458 --> 05:12.666
-And you're a true loser, huh, Dad?
-Tatiana.

05:12.750 --> 05:14.750
Alex and Eva, I wish you all the best.

05:14.833 --> 05:15.666
FRIEND OF THE GROOM

05:15.750 --> 05:17.958
Look, your wedding will be…

05:18.041 --> 05:19.041
5 DAYS BEFORE THE WEDDING

05:19.125 --> 05:20.583
…as gorgeous as my dress.

05:22.666 --> 05:24.125
Allergies.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.958
Admit that you're emotional.

05:28.041 --> 05:29.125
Oh, sis…

05:29.208 --> 05:31.166
Stop it. I can't cry.

05:31.250 --> 05:33.041
Don't. Save it for the divorce.

05:34.041 --> 05:35.875
You're impossible, Tatiana.

05:35.958 --> 05:38.541
Without further ado,
I wish the couple happiness.

05:38.625 --> 05:39.750
I love you.

05:39.833 --> 05:42.166
I want to eat royally.
The wedding better be a feast.

05:42.250 --> 05:43.958
I want to drink myself to death

05:44.041 --> 05:46.958
because I'd take medicine
if I wanted to live, damn it.

05:48.208 --> 05:50.291
Here, a peace dove.

05:50.875 --> 05:52.541
-It sucks, Beto.
-What?

05:52.625 --> 05:54.041
-It sucks.
-Don't say that.

05:54.125 --> 05:55.666
You're so stubborn.

05:55.750 --> 05:58.625
I told you to enhance the resolution
and use a warm color.

05:58.708 --> 06:00.041
You should've simply used HDR.

06:01.541 --> 06:03.750
I didn't get any of that.
I don't speak nerd.

06:03.833 --> 06:06.875
Also, it's Eva's house,
but we share the bills, okay?

06:06.958 --> 06:09.750
-I'm not a freeloader.
-Come on, bro, relax.

06:09.833 --> 06:12.166
-It was just a joke.
-Not a funny one.

06:12.250 --> 06:14.416
Big Beto, listen.
I'm running out of money.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.833
If I can't find a company
to sponsor this game,

06:16.916 --> 06:18.833
I'll have to go back to my boring job.

06:19.416 --> 06:21.208
-Does Eva know?
-Of course not.

06:21.291 --> 06:23.916
She's busy with the wedding.
I don't want to trouble her.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.333
I'll deal with my anxiety.

06:25.416 --> 06:28.833
Your dress is gorgeous. You look perfect.

06:28.916 --> 06:31.291
-Oh, thank you.
-You slayed, Mrs. Eunice.

06:33.458 --> 06:34.375
But…

06:35.208 --> 06:37.208
I think something's missing.

06:42.125 --> 06:46.166
WEDDING GAMES

06:48.583 --> 06:51.375
53H BEFORE THE WEDDING

06:56.500 --> 06:59.916
Don't put Andrade next to Horta,
for the love of God.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.458
They hate each other.

07:02.416 --> 07:03.916
Yeah. Okay.

07:04.416 --> 07:07.208
Yes. Lots of ice, like I said.

07:07.291 --> 07:09.833
Hold on a bit. I've got another call.

07:09.916 --> 07:11.208
Yeah. Let's do that.

07:11.291 --> 07:12.500
Hi, girl.

07:12.583 --> 07:14.666
Yes, I have the map for the tables.

07:15.916 --> 07:17.500
Okay, let's figure it out.

07:19.583 --> 07:20.500
Alex.

07:20.583 --> 07:22.375
Checking e-mails again, babe?

07:22.458 --> 07:25.250
No, I'm checking-in for the flight,
like you asked, babe.

07:25.333 --> 07:26.208
Oh.

07:26.291 --> 07:28.250
Lots and lots of ice.

07:28.333 --> 07:31.000
For Christ's sake, don't forget it.

07:31.500 --> 07:35.208
Yes, the Bahian summer.
You can never have too much ice. Bye.

07:37.041 --> 07:39.041
Baby, have you packed already?

07:39.125 --> 07:41.208
-Five minutes.
-You've been saying that for weeks.

07:41.291 --> 07:44.666
-We leave for the airport in an hour.
-It's just one bag.

07:45.541 --> 07:50.416
Plus, I don't intend on wearing
too many clothes on our honeymoon.

07:54.833 --> 07:58.041
Six months of planning.
I feel like it's all going to go wrong.

07:58.125 --> 08:00.333
Everything will be fine. You're wonderful.

08:01.833 --> 08:02.666
See?

08:05.125 --> 08:06.125
Hi, Mom.

08:06.750 --> 08:07.916
Evinha, my love,

08:08.541 --> 08:10.458
can I kill your mother-in-law?

08:10.541 --> 08:13.916
Why is this side the groom's side
if this one's way better?

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Mom, you were supposed to call
only in case of emergencies.

08:17.083 --> 08:19.291
-Huh?
-What the hell is this?

08:19.375 --> 08:22.416
Let's upgrade this.
It looks like a funeral, not a wedding.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.208
Who did this decor?

08:24.291 --> 08:26.958
It's settled. I'm killing that witch.

08:27.041 --> 08:29.416
Mom, keep it together. I'm coming.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.125
53H BEFORE THE WEDDING

08:32.208 --> 08:34.458
Guys, I'm on the phone here, please.

08:34.541 --> 08:36.875
-Santiago, pay attention.
-Come on.

08:36.958 --> 08:38.125
Honey.

08:38.208 --> 08:40.125
-Hi, Daddy. Is something wrong?
-Honey.

08:40.208 --> 08:44.000
This hitting the road shenanigan
is your fiancé's family tradition.

08:44.083 --> 08:46.125
I should've taken a plane.

08:46.208 --> 08:49.541
Aren't you scared to death of planes, Dad?

08:49.625 --> 08:51.583
I'm more scared of motor homes.

08:52.333 --> 08:55.083
I think you're actually scared
of seeing mom.

08:55.166 --> 08:58.000
Oh, come on, girl. Your mom? Please.

08:58.083 --> 09:01.166
Why? Did she ask about me?

09:04.250 --> 09:07.125
Hi, Alex, this is Suzana,
CEO of Mind Games.

09:07.208 --> 09:09.416
I really need to talk to you
about your game.

09:09.500 --> 09:13.375
But I'm going to London tomorrow.
Could you do it today?

09:13.458 --> 09:14.750
Like at 2 p.m.?

09:18.666 --> 09:21.166
Dad isn't over Mom.

09:21.666 --> 09:23.250
Can you believe it, Alex?

09:23.333 --> 09:25.583
Let me tell you something,

09:25.666 --> 09:28.041
these two are like a soap opera.

09:29.333 --> 09:30.291
Alex?

09:31.583 --> 09:32.875
Is everything okay, babe?

09:35.333 --> 09:37.458
I have to take this. Hi, Mrs. Eunice.

09:37.541 --> 09:41.500
My mom always says things happen
when they're supposed to happen,

09:41.583 --> 09:42.416
but that's bull.

09:42.500 --> 09:45.458
Sometimes they happen
at the worst possible time.

09:45.541 --> 09:46.375
Shit.

09:47.708 --> 09:51.000
Suzana, thank you for calling.
I'm so glad.

09:51.583 --> 09:54.083
But I'll… No, that's too depressing.

09:54.166 --> 09:55.791
Come on, I can do better.

09:56.375 --> 09:59.375
Suzana, thank you for calling.
I'm very happy.

09:59.458 --> 10:00.750
Suzana…

10:00.833 --> 10:03.583
Hi, Suzana, how is it going? It's Alex.

10:03.666 --> 10:05.083
I'm so happy you called,

10:05.166 --> 10:07.541
but I'm traveling for my wedding,
and I can't…

10:07.625 --> 10:08.958
-Alex!
-What?

10:09.041 --> 10:10.333
It's a tragedy.

10:10.416 --> 10:12.500
-What? With our parents?
-Worse!

10:12.583 --> 10:14.291
-What is it?
-The dress.

10:14.791 --> 10:16.625
-It's not ready.
-Wasn't it already?

10:16.708 --> 10:19.875
Yes, but the Renaissance lace
sent from Recife is late.

10:19.958 --> 10:23.208
-What does that mean?
-It's for the hem of the dress.

10:23.291 --> 10:25.166
It was beautiful and delicate.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.416
-It was crucial.
-Relax.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.750
The dress won't be ready until 3:30 p.m.

10:28.833 --> 10:31.375
-Everything's ruined!
-Calm down. Let's think.

10:31.458 --> 10:32.916
We'll figure it out.

10:33.958 --> 10:36.333
We could take a later flight
with Lara and Beto.

10:36.416 --> 10:38.166
I can't get there later, Alex.

10:42.083 --> 10:43.000
But I can.

10:45.500 --> 10:46.875
You go first.

10:47.375 --> 10:49.500
I'll pick up the dress and go later.

10:52.916 --> 10:54.791
52H BEFORE THE WEDDING

10:54.875 --> 10:55.875
Gorgeous!

10:55.958 --> 10:59.083
-Girl!
-I'm so excited!

11:00.583 --> 11:02.583
So, are you ready to get married?

11:02.666 --> 11:04.333
And give up life for a man?

11:04.416 --> 11:07.333
Come on, stop that.
Alex is sweet. Where is he?

11:08.083 --> 11:10.916
-He's going later.
-Why? What did he do?

11:11.000 --> 11:15.166
He'll pick up the dress
and save our wedding!

11:15.250 --> 11:16.708
Save the wedding?

11:16.791 --> 11:18.750
The dress isn't ready. Get the bag.

11:18.833 --> 11:20.375
What? Stop pushing me!

11:20.458 --> 11:21.625
What are you saying?

11:21.708 --> 11:23.833
Nonato! Thanks, honey!

11:23.916 --> 11:26.458
Nonato, darling, put everything there.

11:28.958 --> 11:29.958
Hey, Suzana.

11:30.041 --> 11:31.500
Alex here. How's it going?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.250
So, I can do today at 2 pm.

11:34.750 --> 11:38.291
I know it looks like
I'm only thinking about my work,

11:38.375 --> 11:40.208
but you've heard what Eva said.

11:40.291 --> 11:42.500
I'm saving our wedding.

11:42.583 --> 11:44.000
I didn't lie, Beto.

11:44.083 --> 11:46.166
-I just omitted some details.
-"Details"?

11:46.250 --> 11:50.166
-Bro, they're gonna invest in your game.
-Beto, it's just a meeting. All right?

11:50.250 --> 11:52.875
I don't want to raise expectations
or stress Eva out.

11:52.958 --> 11:54.291
I'm picking up that dress.

11:54.375 --> 11:57.750
I'll go to the meeting at two,
seamstress at 3:30, and airport at five.

11:57.833 --> 11:58.750
It can't go wrong.

11:59.250 --> 12:01.500
…and Eva is such a special woman.

12:01.583 --> 12:03.291
So, Alex, Eva…

12:04.125 --> 12:05.333
I wish you all the best.

12:06.750 --> 12:09.375
See? See that video? See the quality, bro?

12:09.458 --> 12:14.333
I do, and I think she's hot.
Why don't I know her?

12:14.416 --> 12:17.500
Because she lives abroad.
I already told you that, bro.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.333
But tell me something.

12:19.875 --> 12:21.083
Have you two ever…

12:21.583 --> 12:23.083
Come on, don't be a jerk.

12:23.583 --> 12:25.541
Lara's my friend. Besides, she's--

12:25.625 --> 12:27.916
Even hotter in person.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.166
Lara!

12:30.000 --> 12:31.250
Alex!

12:32.166 --> 12:34.583
-Let me help you with the bag.
-Thanks.

12:34.666 --> 12:36.291
-I'm glad you came.
-Nice to see you.

12:36.375 --> 12:39.041
They did it. They definitely did it.

12:40.291 --> 12:43.791
But let's not dwell in the past.
Lil Beto is all about the future.

12:43.875 --> 12:45.041
-Excited?
-I'm nervous.

12:45.125 --> 12:46.750
You are? I'm so excited!

12:46.833 --> 12:49.041
Let's get cracking, my friends.

12:51.541 --> 12:54.083
-Hi. How's it going?
-I'm Beto. Be my guest.

12:54.625 --> 12:57.541
Welcome to the Betomobile.
Always room for one more.

12:59.625 --> 13:00.625
Let's go.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.750
-Shall we?
-Sure.

13:02.833 --> 13:04.208
Ignore the smell.

13:04.291 --> 13:07.291
There are always people passing by
carrying some shady stuff.

13:10.500 --> 13:11.750
Alex isn't picking up.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.541
Relax, everything is fine.

13:15.208 --> 13:16.958
You think something's wrong?

13:17.041 --> 13:18.750
I just said everything's fine.

13:20.083 --> 13:23.250
What inspired the game
was my love story with Eva.

13:23.333 --> 13:26.458
I never thought I would meet
a wonderful woman like her.

13:26.541 --> 13:28.666
Man, your game is great.

13:28.750 --> 13:31.458
Love is universal. Everyone can relate.

13:31.541 --> 13:33.083
Damn, I almost died.

13:33.166 --> 13:34.250
Careful.

13:34.333 --> 13:36.625
Well, it's a co-op game…

13:37.708 --> 13:39.291
with a touch of RPG too.

13:39.375 --> 13:41.166
Each phase is a different type.

13:41.250 --> 13:42.541
Puzzle, fight, race.

13:44.708 --> 13:45.666
Brilliant!

13:46.500 --> 13:50.458
Do you have some time?
I'd like to show your project to my team.

13:51.833 --> 13:52.666
Sure.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.541
Eva and I never really fight.

13:54.625 --> 13:59.250
But I knew she would never forgive me
if I ruined the wedding.

13:59.333 --> 14:02.416
I would never forgive Alex
if he ruined the wedding.

14:02.916 --> 14:05.625
Oh, he said that already?
I'm glad he knows.

14:05.708 --> 14:07.375
Alex is taking forever.

14:08.333 --> 14:12.666
I think he's taking the time we need
to get to know each other better.

14:13.750 --> 14:15.125
I mean…

14:16.166 --> 14:18.166
I'm a groomsman. You're a groomsmaid.

14:18.250 --> 14:22.000
That puts us on another level, a new…

14:22.083 --> 14:23.958
We just need to press start.

14:24.041 --> 14:26.041
It's more like game over.

14:26.125 --> 14:28.833
Look at you using gaming metaphors.

14:29.333 --> 14:31.166
We have so much in common.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.083
No, I beg to differ.

14:33.166 --> 14:35.291
You think you're irresistible,
and I don't.

14:35.916 --> 14:39.041
-You don't think you're irresistible?
-No, you're not.

14:39.125 --> 14:41.125
Oh, wow… Didn't hurt.

14:41.833 --> 14:44.708
You can have
different avatars and genders.

14:44.791 --> 14:46.791
The NPCs will be real people.

14:46.875 --> 14:48.916
Everyone is looking for love.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.291
So you can always play again,
but each time will be different.

14:52.375 --> 14:53.416
Exactly.

14:54.583 --> 14:55.416
-Dope.
-Dope, right?

14:55.500 --> 14:57.666
All right, let's check it out.

15:02.541 --> 15:04.541
2:22 P.M.
MISSED CALL FROM EVA

15:08.750 --> 15:09.791
So, Alex…

15:11.333 --> 15:12.750
Shall we discuss the future?

15:17.833 --> 15:21.166
Let's go, Beto. I'm late.
If you don't run, I'll miss the wedding.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.125
Step on it.

15:26.041 --> 15:27.208
Alex won't pick up.

15:27.291 --> 15:28.208
Enough, Eva!

15:28.291 --> 15:31.250
Alex is getting married too.
You can't control everything.

15:31.333 --> 15:32.666
That's true.

15:33.458 --> 15:35.583
Alex isn't gonna screw up now, right?

15:35.666 --> 15:36.833
No!

15:36.916 --> 15:37.750
48H BEFORE THE WEDDING

15:37.833 --> 15:38.666
CLOSED

15:38.750 --> 15:39.875
Alex.

15:39.958 --> 15:42.416
Call Eva. She has the seamstress's number.

15:42.500 --> 15:45.583
-She'll kill me.
-Get the dress, or I'll kill you.

15:46.166 --> 15:47.166
Think, Alex.

15:49.041 --> 15:50.750
She's probably flying. I will…

15:50.833 --> 15:53.416
I'll find the store online
and get her phone number.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.291
That's it. I got it.

15:55.375 --> 15:57.958
This is so boring!

15:58.041 --> 15:59.250
Let's use my head.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.583
-Will you open the door with it?
-No.

16:01.666 --> 16:04.000
-I'm picking the lock.
-Jesus Christ.

16:04.083 --> 16:06.750
Alex, your friend's insane.
Will you do something?

16:06.833 --> 16:09.500
Be part of the solution,
not the problem, cutie.

16:09.583 --> 16:11.250
This is obviously going wrong.

16:11.333 --> 16:13.791
With all that negative vibe it is.

16:13.875 --> 16:15.541
Let's try the large gate.

16:15.625 --> 16:17.875
As a wise man said,
"time to pop the cork."

16:17.958 --> 16:21.291
Stop! Every time you screw up,
guess who cleans it up?

16:21.375 --> 16:24.500
Freeze! Hands up!

16:24.583 --> 16:25.958
-Hey, Stocky!
-That's me.

16:26.041 --> 16:27.291
Turn around slowly.

16:27.375 --> 16:29.666
No sudden moves, Stocky, nice and slow.

16:29.750 --> 16:32.208
Can someone explain this to me?

16:32.291 --> 16:35.041
I need to get my fiancée's dress
that's in there.

16:35.125 --> 16:36.875
I'm flying for my wedding soon.

16:38.833 --> 16:39.708
Give me a minute.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.375
-Just a minute.
-Okay.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.291
-What's your name?
-Alex Santos.

16:43.375 --> 16:44.833
Eva Trindade's fiancé. You can check.

16:44.916 --> 16:48.541
Shit, kid! Why didn't you say so before?

16:48.625 --> 16:50.333
Hey, Eunice!

16:50.916 --> 16:53.833
This boy here is Miss Eva's fiancé.

16:53.916 --> 16:55.833
Oh, finally!

16:55.916 --> 16:58.375
The dress is in the bag. I'm coming down.

16:58.458 --> 17:00.625
-I'm telling you.
-I'm coming.

17:01.166 --> 17:03.333
Now things seem to be on track.

17:03.416 --> 17:04.833
I'm afraid not, sir.

17:04.916 --> 17:06.458
I need to be on that flight.

17:06.541 --> 17:07.458
47H BEFORE THE WEDDING

17:07.541 --> 17:10.916
You'd need to learn to fly
because that plane has taken off.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.125
-Is there another flight?
-Sure.

17:13.208 --> 17:14.625
-Great.
-Thank God.

17:14.708 --> 17:16.166
It's next week.

17:16.750 --> 17:20.333
-There was a flash sale. We sold out.
-Oh my God.

17:22.750 --> 17:23.583
It's Eva.

17:23.666 --> 17:25.125
-Tell her.
-Don't say a word.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.125
-No.
-No.

17:29.208 --> 17:31.041
Why did I have to lie?

17:33.541 --> 17:36.000
47H BEFORE THE WEDDING

17:41.791 --> 17:43.375
My family's fun, right?

17:43.458 --> 17:45.750
-Yup.
-How about yours?

17:46.333 --> 17:48.958
Man, let me tell you something
about my family…

17:49.041 --> 17:51.041
Sorry. I forgot you're divorced.

17:51.125 --> 17:55.625
But my sister, like they say,
is single and ready to mingle.

17:56.125 --> 17:58.291
She can be tough, but she won't bite.

17:58.375 --> 17:59.875
I mean, I don't think so.

17:59.958 --> 18:03.458
Santiago, my man,
shouldn't you keep your eyes on the road

18:03.541 --> 18:05.958
and focus solely on driving?

18:06.041 --> 18:07.333
Highways are dangerous.

18:07.416 --> 18:10.083
Don't worry. This thing is a tank.

18:10.583 --> 18:11.833
Ah!

18:12.500 --> 18:16.208
Oh my God! Step off the gas!
And don't slam on the brakes!

18:17.750 --> 18:19.666
Go right! The road's free!

18:19.750 --> 18:22.041
-Santiago, stop.
-Jesus take the wheel.

18:22.125 --> 18:23.500
-Relax.
-Hold on.

18:25.958 --> 18:27.833
Look. Here we are.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.291
-Marcos.
-Yeah?

18:46.791 --> 18:49.041
-Who changed this?
-The groom's mother.

18:49.125 --> 18:50.833
Now we're talking.

18:50.916 --> 18:53.125
Colors and flowers.

18:53.208 --> 18:56.000
White on white is so bland.
Don't you think so, Andrea?

18:56.083 --> 18:58.833
-Yes, ma'am.
-Where's the wedding planner?

18:58.916 --> 19:00.500
-You listen to me.
-Mrs. Elvira.

19:00.583 --> 19:03.041
The wine samples are here
for you to taste them.

19:03.125 --> 19:05.333
Now? One day before the wedding?

19:05.833 --> 19:07.916
I like them fresh.

19:08.416 --> 19:10.583
-Let's go, Batista.
-I'm coming too.

19:11.083 --> 19:15.000
Because the wine must pair
with the entrée, the appetizers,

19:15.083 --> 19:17.000
the cake and even the sweets.

19:17.083 --> 19:20.458
-And you know all about pairing, huh?
-Sure.

19:21.208 --> 19:23.291
He's not well. He's getting married.

19:23.791 --> 19:27.166
Ms. Valéria, for the love of God,
it's a matter of life and death.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.666
If it's a matter of life and death…

19:31.041 --> 19:32.875
Yes, we have three seats.

19:32.958 --> 19:34.500
It's our last flight.

19:34.583 --> 19:36.791
-Oh, thank God.
-We lucked out.

19:37.791 --> 19:40.291
Last flight of the day.
It has to be this one.

19:40.375 --> 19:42.875
It's our last flight ever, sir. Yeah.

19:42.958 --> 19:45.791
The airline is seeking new challenges.

19:45.875 --> 19:48.625
-Wait. The airline's gone under?
-No, no.

19:49.291 --> 19:51.750
It's judicial recovery.

19:51.833 --> 19:54.583
Too many labor disputes, mine included.

19:54.666 --> 19:57.541
-Oh God.
-Tell me, is this city close to Ilhéus?

19:57.625 --> 20:01.916
It's a three-hour drive.
Four if there's traffic. Five, tops.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.833
Awesome. Three one-way tickets, then.

20:04.916 --> 20:08.291
It's all they have. Didn't you hear him?
It's a ghost airline.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.250
Hang on. Use my card.

20:11.541 --> 20:13.000
We only take cash.

20:13.500 --> 20:17.958
Due to the legal, bank,
and financial issues I mentioned.

20:18.041 --> 20:20.416
-Just a minute, please.
-Excuse me, sir.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.250
Shit.

20:24.333 --> 20:26.541
MESSIAH AVIATION

20:26.625 --> 20:28.916
If that's the sign,
can you imagine the plane?

20:29.000 --> 20:31.625
-I'm not going. It's terrifying.
-No, sir.

20:31.708 --> 20:34.250
The aircraft is excellent.

20:34.333 --> 20:37.583
Older pots make the best food.

20:37.666 --> 20:39.541
That makes no sense.

20:39.625 --> 20:41.541
It doesn't. Sorry, I'm not going.

20:41.625 --> 20:44.666
Where's the bus station?
Does anyone have a parachute?

20:44.750 --> 20:48.291
-Here it is. You can check.
-Jeez, just shut up.

20:48.375 --> 20:50.958
Do it for Alex.
Five drops, and you'll be fine.

20:51.041 --> 20:53.708
-Five drops…
-Is it all there?

20:53.791 --> 20:56.875
-Baggage.
-You can check these here.

20:56.958 --> 20:58.791
This one's coming with me.

20:59.291 --> 21:01.083
I can't do that.

21:01.166 --> 21:02.875
This is the bride's dress.

21:03.666 --> 21:07.166
You either check it
or you're not boarding.

21:21.416 --> 21:23.666
Uh, Juan, please. Stop that.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.500
We can't even talk. All right?

21:27.166 --> 21:28.583
Pour your heart out.

21:28.666 --> 21:32.666
This love thing
requires courage and honesty.

21:32.750 --> 21:33.708
It's not for me.

21:33.791 --> 21:36.583
Elvira is a strong, powerful woman.

21:36.666 --> 21:38.333
Look, Mom, he likes his ex.

21:38.416 --> 21:40.916
Shut up, Adelaide. Tell me more, hon.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.250
Me, I'm just a writer
who can't even write anymore.

21:44.333 --> 21:45.333
I love romance.

21:45.416 --> 21:48.541
I like it with or without romance,
right, Mom?

21:48.625 --> 21:51.458
I like rough sex, fisting, fucking,

21:51.541 --> 21:54.041
hair pulling, BDSM,

21:54.125 --> 21:57.291
throuples, threesomes, gangbangs…

21:57.375 --> 22:00.750
I like romance, you know?
With a lot of plot twists.

22:00.833 --> 22:03.541
Someone coming back from the past,
all of that cliché.

22:03.625 --> 22:04.708
I'm cliché.

22:04.791 --> 22:07.666
I'm nervous just thinking
about seeing her at the wedding.

22:07.750 --> 22:10.041
-Tell her you love her.
-What if she doesn't want me?

22:10.125 --> 22:12.958
Then you suffer.
From three months to six years.

22:13.041 --> 22:17.166
You know? You can suffer,
think you'll die, try to kill yourself.

22:17.250 --> 22:20.625
Then you'll start drinking,
doing drugs, you know?

22:20.708 --> 22:23.250
You'll hit rock bottom and feel like shit,

22:23.333 --> 22:26.041
but then you can be reborn
and maybe find new love.

22:26.125 --> 22:29.875
Listen up, family. We're ready to leave.

22:32.458 --> 22:34.583
-Wonderful.
-Here's the money, chief.

22:34.666 --> 22:37.416
-Keep the change. Let's go.
-Let's hit it.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.750
Come, Adelaide.

22:43.375 --> 22:48.041
I'd totally forgotten
about this wine stuff.

22:48.125 --> 22:50.125
-Oh, no.
-Yeah.

22:50.208 --> 22:51.750
I completely forgot.

22:51.833 --> 22:55.750
Batista was always bugging me
because of the wine.

22:55.833 --> 22:58.958
But my mind was on the cachaça.

22:59.041 --> 23:01.958
I mean, look around you, hon.

23:02.458 --> 23:03.625
Bahia.

23:04.166 --> 23:08.458
Do you know how many
wonderful cachaças we've got here?

23:09.041 --> 23:10.958
And how many types of fruit?

23:11.041 --> 23:13.000
It's endless, hon.

23:13.083 --> 23:15.125
God save Bahia!

23:15.208 --> 23:17.000
God save Bahia!

23:18.250 --> 23:20.541
No, don't drink. Don't drink.

23:20.625 --> 23:22.583
-My drink…
-Focus on me.

23:22.666 --> 23:24.166
I gotta tell you something.

23:24.250 --> 23:26.000
-It's nice.
-Seriously, look…

23:27.291 --> 23:30.125
-This wedding…
-"This wedding…"

23:30.208 --> 23:32.166
-It's in Brazil.
-Yeah.

23:32.666 --> 23:34.291
Capirinha…

23:35.666 --> 23:37.791
is so much better!

23:44.666 --> 23:47.750
The video is fine,
except for Juan's singing.

23:47.833 --> 23:49.750
-What do you mean?
-It's terrible.

23:49.833 --> 23:51.958
-Me? Would you like to sing?
-Yeah.

23:52.041 --> 23:53.583
-I can sing.
-Adelaide, look.

23:53.666 --> 23:57.250
-He's perfect for you. I'll swipe right!
-Stop trying to find me a man.

23:57.333 --> 24:00.083
Damn! Come see the wedding video.

24:00.166 --> 24:02.291
Video? What video?

24:02.375 --> 24:05.000
-What do you mean? Everyone made one.
-Really?

24:05.083 --> 24:08.083
-Santiago!
-Hey.

24:08.166 --> 24:10.750
-Why didn't they ask me for a video?
-Or me?

24:10.833 --> 24:15.208
People, for Christ's sake.
Please, don't disturb the driver.

24:15.291 --> 24:17.250
-But it's very important!
-It is!

24:17.333 --> 24:21.250
-How come we didn't get to make a video?
-Look, talk to the wedding planner.

24:21.333 --> 24:24.541
He said, "groomsmen, bridesmaids,
and close family."

24:24.625 --> 24:26.750
I'll show that clown what close family is.

24:26.833 --> 24:29.791
Let's make this video, Mom.
Juan, get the camera.

24:30.291 --> 24:34.000
Listen here, I was married six times.
All of them flawless.

24:34.083 --> 24:37.583
I don't know if I'll ever get married.
Maybe just move in together.

24:37.666 --> 24:39.666
-Where?
-Well, at our house, Mom.

24:39.750 --> 24:41.208
-I don't want that.
-Why?

24:41.291 --> 24:43.458
Getting married
and living with your mom sucks.

24:43.541 --> 24:45.000
Well, you can adapt.

24:45.083 --> 24:47.666
Or you could move out.
It's about time you do that.

24:47.750 --> 24:50.833
Me, move out?
It's my house, Adelaide. I bought it.

24:50.916 --> 24:53.958
Do you want to send your mother
to a nursing home, Adelaide?

24:54.041 --> 24:55.708
I don't know, Mom. Figure it out.

24:55.791 --> 24:58.083
The point is,
if I get married, we're living there.

24:58.166 --> 25:02.333
Whether it's Flávio, Márcio,
Adriano or Adriana, or Ângela.

25:02.416 --> 25:04.500
Yes, I know. You're so eclectic.

25:04.583 --> 25:07.875
You always see the flaws in everyone,
so I won't even worry.

25:07.958 --> 25:10.041
I don't see the flaws.
I just have standards.

25:10.125 --> 25:13.583
I want a romantic,
honest, hard-working man

25:13.666 --> 25:16.000
who enjoys wine and can bake bread,

25:16.083 --> 25:20.500
wash cars, do body hair wax designs,

25:20.583 --> 25:23.000
like the shape of a sun,
a butterfly, or a heart, Mom.

25:23.083 --> 25:24.625
Of a moth, of Shiva.

25:24.708 --> 25:27.291
I want him to fix the phone,
clean the couch,

25:27.375 --> 25:28.791
the heavy rug.

25:28.875 --> 25:31.291
Okay, should we start over?

25:31.375 --> 25:33.375
There's no recipe for marriages.

25:33.458 --> 25:35.500
But there's a key ingredient…

25:35.583 --> 25:36.875
-Courage.
-Honesty.

25:36.958 --> 25:39.500
-It was honesty, honey.
-I can't lie, Mom.

25:44.375 --> 25:47.916
I have to admit that, at first,
I didn't really like this…

25:48.000 --> 25:50.125
-Alex!
-This insecure boy.

25:50.208 --> 25:51.708
He was insecure.

25:51.791 --> 25:54.791
But look, let me tell you something…

25:56.166 --> 25:57.583
He's so good for my Evinha.

25:57.666 --> 25:59.041
-Is he?
-Yeah.

25:59.125 --> 26:01.791
Evinha now is so zen, so calm.

26:01.875 --> 26:04.666
-Calm? That's good.
-She's…

26:04.750 --> 26:07.041
-Mommy!
-Damn, man, what the hell?

26:07.583 --> 26:09.000
What's wrong, girl?

26:09.083 --> 26:11.750
-Evinha!
-Oh my God.

26:11.833 --> 26:13.833
-Honey.
-This is great.

26:13.916 --> 26:16.208
You're sweet. You're so sweet.

26:16.916 --> 26:18.875
There's my other beautiful daughter.

26:18.958 --> 26:21.625
-Tati, my beautiful girl.
-Are you drunk?

26:21.708 --> 26:24.541
-She's so pretty.
-Hold on.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.500
-What, Eva?
-Are you two drunk?

26:27.083 --> 26:28.750
Nope. Negative. Not at all.

26:28.833 --> 26:32.625
-Didn't they hate each other?
-A wedding can work wonders.

26:32.708 --> 26:34.541
Booze can work wonders.

26:34.625 --> 26:37.083
-Hey, Batista.
-Yes, Miss Eva?

26:37.166 --> 26:40.541
I want to check on everything.
Got it? Everything!

26:40.625 --> 26:43.333
-Miss Eva.
-Would you like a drink?

26:43.416 --> 26:45.333
-Come drink.
-Come.

26:45.416 --> 26:47.166
-Girls, enough.
-It's kiwi.

26:47.250 --> 26:49.791
-Sing for us.
-How long have you been drinking for?

26:51.750 --> 26:54.125
Everyone says
brides turn into bridezillas.

26:54.625 --> 26:56.250
But who has to decide on everything?

26:56.750 --> 26:59.916
The dress, the catering,
the music, the pastries,

27:00.000 --> 27:03.833
the ribbon for wrapping the pastries.

27:05.041 --> 27:09.500
Next time, I want to be the groom.
I'll get to just show up and say "yes."

27:10.333 --> 27:12.291
That was Alex's only job.

27:13.625 --> 27:15.250
It couldn't go wrong, could it?

27:23.291 --> 27:25.125
Knock-knock. Can we come in?

27:25.916 --> 27:27.291
You already have.

27:30.666 --> 27:33.333
-This is chaos.
-Calm down.

27:33.416 --> 27:37.375
-Everything's fine.
-Actually, almost everything.

27:37.458 --> 27:39.416
-Tell her, girls.
-Oh my God.

27:39.500 --> 27:40.916
Is something missing?

27:41.541 --> 27:44.750
The bachelorette party!

27:46.333 --> 27:49.125
Girls, I'm exhausted. Can't you see that?

27:49.208 --> 27:52.250
No, you're not.
That's for after the wedding, right?

27:52.333 --> 27:55.416
We must say goodbye to our friend.

27:55.500 --> 27:58.458
-Come with us.
-Goodbye, little friend.

27:58.541 --> 28:00.166
-I can't believe it.
-Goodbye.

28:00.250 --> 28:03.791
-No.
-Goodbye!

28:05.000 --> 28:07.666
-Goodbye.
-I'm coming.

28:13.625 --> 28:16.708
-Sofia, honey, is everything okay?
-Everything's fine, Dad.

28:17.500 --> 28:19.666
-Oh, boy, I slept.
-You ought to be brave.

28:19.750 --> 28:21.708
She's a better driver than me.

28:22.833 --> 28:24.208
-It's not that.
-No?

28:24.291 --> 28:26.750
-What is it, then?
-No, it's not like that.

28:26.833 --> 28:29.583
Juan! It's not like that, Juan!

28:29.666 --> 28:31.833
It's G minor, Juan! Look.

28:31.916 --> 28:33.416
Look at my finger.

28:34.708 --> 28:38.500
But life…

28:40.666 --> 28:44.708
Is it "wonderlife" or just suffering?

28:49.083 --> 28:50.708
Is it joy

28:51.291 --> 28:53.375
Or grief?

28:55.541 --> 28:58.791
What is it

28:59.541 --> 29:01.250
My brother?

29:01.916 --> 29:06.000
Some say life
Means nothing at all

29:06.791 --> 29:08.958
It's a force
It's some time

29:09.458 --> 29:11.583
That's not even a second

29:12.541 --> 29:17.208
Some say
It's a deep, divine mystery

29:18.125 --> 29:21.000
A breath by the Creator

29:21.083 --> 29:23.958
An act filled with love

29:24.041 --> 29:26.625
You say it's struggle and pleasure

29:26.708 --> 29:28.750
He says life is living

29:29.416 --> 29:31.708
She says dying is better

29:31.791 --> 29:34.750
Because she's not loved
And the verb is to suffer

29:35.250 --> 29:40.291
I just know I trust the lady
And I put the strength of my faith in her

29:40.791 --> 29:43.291
We're the ones who make life

29:43.375 --> 29:46.125
As we can, have to, or want to

29:47.208 --> 29:51.166
Always desired

29:51.958 --> 29:56.166
Even if it's wrong

29:56.250 --> 29:57.416
-I can't do it.
-No, stop that.

29:57.500 --> 29:58.375
45H BEFORE THE WEDDING

29:58.458 --> 30:00.666
I'm out of medicine.
Mr. Pilot took everything.

30:00.750 --> 30:03.208
It's not that. I need to talk to Eva.

30:03.291 --> 30:05.125
-I'll call her.
-Do it.

30:06.083 --> 30:08.375
Call her and tell her the truth.

30:16.500 --> 30:17.333
Alex?

30:17.416 --> 30:19.416
-Hi, babe?
-Hi, baby.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.125
I called you so many times.

30:21.208 --> 30:22.958
Well, babe, uh…

30:23.458 --> 30:25.500
-Is everything okay?
-Babe, uh…

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
-The flight got cancelled.
-No.

30:29.083 --> 30:30.250
Really?

30:30.958 --> 30:34.875
Yeah, but I got another one.
It's to a city near Ilhéus.

30:35.375 --> 30:36.875
Not so close, but not so far.

30:36.958 --> 30:39.416
-Alex…
-What matters is that I'm coming.

30:39.500 --> 30:42.208
I'll be a little late,
but I will be there, okay?

30:42.291 --> 30:44.666
I have to go. I'm about to board.

30:44.750 --> 30:46.708
No, Alex!

30:46.791 --> 30:47.708
Bye.

30:52.125 --> 30:53.083
I couldn't.

30:56.250 --> 30:57.083
Let's go.

30:58.166 --> 31:02.125
In poems and love songs,
honesty is a beautiful thing.

31:02.625 --> 31:05.166
In real life, it doesn't work like that.

31:05.250 --> 31:09.208
Especially when dealing with a bride
the day before the wedding.

31:09.916 --> 31:12.958
But I knew I'd be able to fix everything.

31:18.375 --> 31:20.875
There's always an unexpected turn
in every wedding.

31:20.958 --> 31:22.625
I thought there could be a storm.

31:22.708 --> 31:25.166
Or that Beto could get drunk
and fall on the cake.

31:25.750 --> 31:30.875
But not having the groom and the dress?
That never crossed my mind.

31:31.750 --> 31:34.958
Alex's ghosting
was starting to feel very odd.

31:35.750 --> 31:37.500
Horizonte Airlines, good evening.

31:37.583 --> 31:39.625
-Good evening.
-How may I help you?

31:39.708 --> 31:42.125
I'd like some information on a flight.

31:43.208 --> 31:46.625
-Here's to Eva!
-To Eva!

31:46.708 --> 31:48.041
-Carlos.
-Hi, Miss Eva.

31:48.125 --> 31:49.916
One more, please.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.541
-Of course.
-Eva?

31:53.916 --> 31:55.583
To Eva!

31:55.666 --> 31:56.750
Wonderf-- Oops!

31:58.708 --> 32:00.750
Hurry, we still have
to pick up our luggage.

32:00.833 --> 32:02.666
I'm feeling sick.

32:04.791 --> 32:07.416
-What is it?
-I'm fine. Go ahead.

32:07.500 --> 32:10.166
I just need some privacy.
I'll meet you soon.

32:10.250 --> 32:11.875
-We'll be right back.
-Mind your busin…

32:15.208 --> 32:17.541
-Ew, disgusting.
-I don't remember eating that.

32:19.375 --> 32:23.375
I feel brand new.
If you have more medicine, I'll take it.

32:23.458 --> 32:25.500
What are you talking about, dude?

32:27.083 --> 32:29.000
Jesus! Look what they did to my bag!

32:29.083 --> 32:31.458
I even asked for "fragile" stickers!

32:32.291 --> 32:35.250
-Did it ruin the dress?
-Don't even say that.

32:35.333 --> 32:37.583
You're the groom. You can't see it.

32:37.666 --> 32:39.208
-Then open it.
-Okay.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.791
-Relax. You're too stressed out.
-Wait.

32:43.375 --> 32:45.875
Oh God, this is the last thing we need.
Hold on.

32:45.958 --> 32:48.666
Last call to board through gate…

32:49.875 --> 32:50.791
So, Lara?

32:51.791 --> 32:53.833
Alex, you better come see this.

32:53.916 --> 32:55.833
But it will ruin the wedding.

32:58.666 --> 33:00.000
A country wedding?

33:02.083 --> 33:02.916
No.

33:06.166 --> 33:10.000
That liar Alex won't ruin
my last free night.

33:10.083 --> 33:11.208
That's the spirit.

33:12.083 --> 33:13.583
To Eva!

33:14.125 --> 33:15.375
To us.

33:15.458 --> 33:17.375
To all women!

33:19.250 --> 33:21.875
Luckily the accordionist's address
was on his bag.

33:21.958 --> 33:26.041
ARRIVALS TERMINAL

33:26.125 --> 33:28.041
Unfortunately, it's out in the sticks.

33:31.916 --> 33:36.125
But Beto is going to get us a car,
even if he has to steal one.

33:42.833 --> 33:44.583
Don't be like that, Alex.

33:44.666 --> 33:46.291
Everything will work out.

33:47.958 --> 33:51.625
Maybe it's a sign
that I'm not good enough for Eva.

33:52.833 --> 33:54.958
-I just ruin everything.
-I have your back.

33:56.583 --> 33:58.375
But you've been lying to Eva all day.

33:58.458 --> 34:01.208
I just did that
so Eva wouldn't be more worried.

34:09.833 --> 34:12.375
Are you sabotaging your own wedding?

34:13.750 --> 34:15.250
Subconsciously.

34:17.291 --> 34:18.833
Why would I do that?

34:20.000 --> 34:22.125
You're scared. Insecure.

34:24.458 --> 34:27.500
Maybe you love someone else,
or you want to take the job offer.

34:27.583 --> 34:30.666
First, there's no offer.
It's just a possibility.

34:31.166 --> 34:32.958
Second, it's to work in London.

34:33.583 --> 34:35.375
How could I accept that offer?

34:46.375 --> 34:48.333
If it's subconscious, how could I know?

34:57.041 --> 35:01.916
Shall we Fast & Furious out of here?
I'll take the luggage.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.583
-Let's go.
-I'll take care of this. Then I call Eva.

35:04.666 --> 35:06.750
I don't want to stress her out even more.

35:11.458 --> 35:13.541
Girls, I'm getting another drink!

35:14.208 --> 35:15.083
What?

35:15.875 --> 35:18.208
-What?
-What did she say? I couldn't hear it.

35:27.375 --> 35:28.500
Hey, buddy.

35:32.291 --> 35:33.541
Gabriel?

35:33.625 --> 35:36.583
-Eva, what are you doing here?
-I'm getting married.

35:36.666 --> 35:40.791
Yeah, the entire town knows it.
I mean, what are you doing at my bar?

35:41.791 --> 35:44.000
-This is your bar?
-Cool, huh?

35:44.083 --> 35:46.208
Just like you've always dreamed.

35:46.291 --> 35:48.541
It's better now that you're here.

35:49.875 --> 35:51.583
It's my bachelorette party.

35:51.666 --> 35:54.625
Gee, that deserves a toast.
How many drinks?

35:55.208 --> 35:56.333
-Four.
-Four?

35:56.416 --> 35:59.208
Bro, give me four tequila shots. Big ones.

35:59.291 --> 36:00.958
Give me those. I got it.

36:02.083 --> 36:03.125
Thanks, man.

36:03.750 --> 36:05.041
On the house.

36:05.875 --> 36:07.291
-Wow.
-Want some help?

36:08.333 --> 36:11.041
I was a waitress, Gabriel.
Don't you remember?

36:11.125 --> 36:12.208
You never know.

36:22.958 --> 36:24.666
42H BEFORE THE WEDDING

36:24.750 --> 36:26.125
So in tune.

36:30.791 --> 36:32.750
Every time I perform in São Paulo,

36:32.833 --> 36:35.458
I get so nervous and lost that I screw up.

36:35.958 --> 36:38.541
But getting my bag mixed up was a first.

36:40.291 --> 36:41.958
Relax, Mr. Hélio, it's all cool.

36:42.041 --> 36:44.083
-We understand.
-I appreciate it.

36:44.166 --> 36:45.833
Hey, Lara. Everything okay?

36:45.916 --> 36:48.875
-I'm checking it out, hang on.
-Hey, guys!

36:48.958 --> 36:50.000
Big John!

36:50.791 --> 36:53.541
-Would you like some?
-What's that, bro?

36:53.625 --> 36:54.958
It's all homemade.

36:55.041 --> 36:57.583
Then I'm easily eating this
because I'm starving.

36:59.458 --> 37:00.708
I can't believe it.

37:00.791 --> 37:01.875
What is it, Lara?

37:03.458 --> 37:07.041
-What a gorgeous dress!
-Thank God.

37:07.125 --> 37:09.625
-I'm even hungry now. May I?
-Sure.

37:10.208 --> 37:12.000
There's plenty of food here.

37:12.083 --> 37:15.375
But let's take it easy
because we have to go.

37:15.458 --> 37:17.208
Girls!

37:17.291 --> 37:20.375
-It's Gabriel's bar.
-What streetcar?

37:20.458 --> 37:22.125
No way!

37:22.208 --> 37:23.875
Guess who's here.

37:23.958 --> 37:25.083
He's at the counter.

37:25.166 --> 37:26.791
-Is it cucumber?
-Nice.

37:27.666 --> 37:30.083
I'll just take a selfie over there.

37:30.583 --> 37:33.125
The DJ is kinda cute, but the music sucks.

37:33.208 --> 37:34.833
-I'll take care of it.
-What?

38:02.208 --> 38:03.125
Oh, boy.

38:04.875 --> 38:06.041
I'm sure it will work.

38:08.166 --> 38:10.875
Hey, did you check the gas?

38:11.375 --> 38:12.500
I don't know.

38:14.041 --> 38:17.333
-I think the gauge is broken.
-No, Beto!

38:17.416 --> 38:19.125
No!

38:34.833 --> 38:39.166
Bro, I'm pretty sure
I kept two gallons of gasoline here.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.083
I put it there, where it's safer.

38:41.166 --> 38:43.625
I wonder if… Oh, I remember now.

38:43.708 --> 38:47.291
It was Big John.
He came by and took it for the…

38:48.291 --> 38:49.958
What's it called again?

38:50.041 --> 38:53.250
You strike a match,
throw it, and it lights up.

38:53.333 --> 38:56.125
-Holy shit! Oh my God.
-What?

38:56.208 --> 38:58.000
-Thanks, guys.
-Oh.

38:58.083 --> 38:59.916
I remember now. The bonfire.

39:00.708 --> 39:04.416
Now there's no more gas left.
Only tomorrow at the gas station.

39:05.125 --> 39:09.000
-Mr. Hélio, Alex is going to kill me.
-No, he won't, kid.

39:09.083 --> 39:11.833
Stay and enjoy the Harvest Festival.

39:12.458 --> 39:13.583
Harvest Festival?

39:14.541 --> 39:15.750
What do you grow here?

39:15.833 --> 39:18.583
The special ingredient
in everything you've eaten here.

39:19.166 --> 39:20.500
We've eaten it?

39:20.583 --> 39:21.625
Love.

39:22.375 --> 39:25.541
It's 100% organic.

39:26.916 --> 39:29.625
Jesus Christ, Mr. Hélio.

39:30.125 --> 39:34.250
Alex is so pure.
He's not used to this kind of stuff.

39:34.333 --> 39:37.500
What terrible effect could this have
on my friend's life?

39:37.583 --> 39:39.083
It feels so good.

39:40.333 --> 39:43.333
I guess we have to let
the universe do its thing.

39:43.416 --> 39:44.541
I'll bet.

39:44.625 --> 39:46.833
Oh my God! Hi, girls, how are you?

39:46.916 --> 39:49.458
Have you seen my friend?
He's about this tall.

39:49.541 --> 39:53.166
He looks like a teen Denzel Washington.
He's polite, charming.

39:53.250 --> 39:54.125
-You haven't?
-No.

39:54.208 --> 39:55.791
My dear God…

39:56.458 --> 40:01.625
Alex!

40:05.833 --> 40:07.583
Look out, friends. I'm coming.

40:07.666 --> 40:09.000
Coming…

40:10.958 --> 40:13.333
I need to tell you something serious.

40:14.416 --> 40:15.541
We're totally screwed.

40:15.625 --> 40:17.458
Screwed…

40:17.541 --> 40:19.916
I missed you so much, Beto.

40:21.250 --> 40:22.375
-Really?
-Yeah.

40:22.458 --> 40:23.666
-Don't be silly.
-I swear.

40:23.750 --> 40:24.833
-So silly.
-Seriously.

40:24.916 --> 40:26.750
-Beto.
-You didn't.

40:26.833 --> 40:27.666
Hey.

40:28.708 --> 40:30.500
I thought you were gone.

40:30.583 --> 40:33.875
Gone where, Lara?
It's like you're super high.

40:36.333 --> 40:37.375
Oh, I don't know.

40:38.625 --> 40:40.833
-Where are we going again?
-Damn!

40:42.875 --> 40:45.041
No, we can't be laughing like this.

40:45.125 --> 40:47.541
Something very serious happened.
We need to talk.

40:47.625 --> 40:49.375
First thing… Wait, it's two things.

40:49.458 --> 40:52.500
Alex, we're out of gas.
We can only get it tomorrow.

40:52.583 --> 40:54.500
Don't say that, for Christ's sake! No!

40:54.583 --> 40:56.875
-It's true.
-No, man! No!

40:56.958 --> 40:58.416
-Chill.
-And the second thing?

40:58.916 --> 41:00.333
The second thing…

41:00.416 --> 41:01.791
Breathe and tell me.

41:04.458 --> 41:05.291
I forgot.

41:05.916 --> 41:11.125
I totally forgot.
Like leaving a pizza in the oven.

41:11.791 --> 41:17.333
Like forgetting to get garlic bread
at the stake house.

41:19.791 --> 41:21.291
I love you, silly.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.708
-I love you.
-Stop it.

41:24.291 --> 41:26.250
-I love you.
-No, I love you.

41:26.333 --> 41:28.625
Hey! That was the second thing.

41:28.708 --> 41:31.666
The first thing was the gas.
The second was something about love.

41:31.750 --> 41:33.000
-Love…
-Beto…

41:34.000 --> 41:35.666
Everything is about love.

41:36.416 --> 41:37.291
Shit.

41:48.375 --> 41:50.666
Marriage is just great.

41:51.541 --> 41:53.500
It's great, you know? It's very…

41:54.458 --> 41:55.416
Great.

42:01.333 --> 42:05.000
-How long have you been married?
-I've never been married.

42:19.291 --> 42:20.166
Eva.

42:21.583 --> 42:22.791
Gabriel?

42:36.625 --> 42:40.291
33H BEFORE THE WEDDING

42:49.666 --> 42:51.208
Why are you crowing, Beto?

42:51.708 --> 42:55.125
Come on, Mr. Hélio fixed everything.
We got a full tank. Let's go.

42:55.208 --> 42:58.666
-What's the time? I have to call Eva.
-Call her later. There's no signal here.

42:58.750 --> 43:00.875
-I need to get something done today.
-What?

43:00.958 --> 43:02.250
I'll explain on the way.

43:04.250 --> 43:07.250
I never got the concept
of a bachelorette party.

43:08.250 --> 43:12.250
Why be reminded of everything you'll lose
by getting married one day before that?

43:13.083 --> 43:17.708
Everyone talks about "happily ever after,"
but no one talks about "never again."

43:19.500 --> 43:22.125
I had no doubts about my love for Alex,

43:23.083 --> 43:26.208
but all that mess had me wondering.

43:26.291 --> 43:29.541
Was I ready to never have doubts again?

43:33.708 --> 43:34.541
Hello?

43:36.625 --> 43:37.458
Hello?

43:40.125 --> 43:41.708
Hello? Alex?

43:42.583 --> 43:44.166
Babe, is that you?

43:44.875 --> 43:45.750
Hi, Eva.

43:46.583 --> 43:47.541
Gabriel?

43:48.375 --> 43:49.833
We have to talk.

43:52.500 --> 43:55.125
So, friends, I was out of money, you know?

43:55.208 --> 43:58.625
You'd already spent a lot on tickets,
so I was ashamed to ask.

43:58.708 --> 44:02.500
They didn't take credit cards or checks,
but they'd be screwed if they did anyway.

44:02.583 --> 44:05.833
My card's been blocked for years.
And come on, checks?

44:05.916 --> 44:08.416
Who uses checks nowadays?
Maybe a dinosaur.

44:08.500 --> 44:09.750
Spit it out.

44:10.250 --> 44:14.541
I rented the car for two hours,
and it's been, like, 12 hours.

44:15.125 --> 44:19.250
Hold on. Did you think that,
in two hours, we could pick up the dress,

44:19.333 --> 44:23.375
go to the resort, get Alex married,
and you would return the car?

44:23.458 --> 44:27.000
The plan was to get the dress,
return the car, and then go.

44:27.083 --> 44:28.583
How, genius?

44:28.666 --> 44:33.666
I don't know! I didn't think it through.
These were desperate times.

44:33.750 --> 44:36.833
And you didn't think
it'd be a good idea to tell your friends?

44:36.916 --> 44:39.291
Calm down, folks. I'm sorry. I forgot.

44:39.375 --> 44:41.833
Do you all remember
what happened last night?

44:44.500 --> 44:48.000
-Did something happen?
-As far as I remember, nothing remarkable.

44:56.166 --> 44:57.291
31H BEFORE THE WEDDING

44:57.375 --> 44:59.000
A kiss means nothing.

45:00.625 --> 45:02.208
Will your fiancé agree?

45:06.291 --> 45:07.125
We'll see.

45:10.208 --> 45:11.583
I'm telling him everything.

45:14.125 --> 45:15.750
Are you gonna show him the picture?

45:17.791 --> 45:20.166
-What picture?
-I didn't remember it too.

45:20.250 --> 45:22.416
-I was shocked when I saw it.
-Let me see.

45:22.500 --> 45:24.416
My phone's charging, but I can delete it.

45:27.333 --> 45:28.666
But it's gonna cost you.

45:33.541 --> 45:35.250
What are you saying, Gabriel?

45:35.333 --> 45:40.166
Eva, I'm heavily in debt.
The bar is crowded, but there's no profit.

45:40.833 --> 45:43.916
I don't know how to take care of business
like you do.

45:45.458 --> 45:47.833
Are you really blackmailing me?

45:47.916 --> 45:51.541
Me, blackmailing? Hell no!
You help me. I help you.

45:51.625 --> 45:54.833
-Your nerd won't find out.
-That's blackmailing, idiot.

45:54.916 --> 45:56.333
-It's a crime!
-Don't pay, then!

45:56.416 --> 45:58.875
I'll send him the pic.
Kissing is not a crime.

45:59.708 --> 46:03.250
-You're not doing that.
-Isn't he so understanding?

46:03.333 --> 46:05.875
I can send him the other pictures too.

46:05.958 --> 46:07.291
What pictures, Gabriel?

46:07.375 --> 46:09.291
The sexier ones.

46:09.375 --> 46:11.166
Nothing happened between us.

46:11.250 --> 46:15.791
I didn't remember either.
You know how our memory gets with booze.

46:15.875 --> 46:17.083
You're bluffing!

46:18.166 --> 46:19.250
Then don't pay.

46:20.250 --> 46:21.958
Or pay the price later.

46:22.791 --> 46:25.083
There you go. This is the amount.

46:25.666 --> 46:29.125
It may not be much for you,
but it can cost you your wedding.

46:29.208 --> 46:31.416
I'll wait for you by the coconut grove.

46:32.708 --> 46:33.750
Go alone.

46:39.708 --> 46:41.458
Yes, we did kiss.

46:41.541 --> 46:44.291
-But nothing else happened.
-Damn, girl.

46:44.375 --> 46:47.625
We got pretty wasted.
I don't remember anything after Ana left.

46:47.708 --> 46:50.375
I just remember inviting
some guys to the wedding.

46:50.458 --> 46:53.000
-You did what?
-After that, it's all a blur.

46:53.083 --> 46:56.125
If Eva says nothing happened,
then nothing happened.

46:56.208 --> 46:58.208
But we can't be 100% sure.

46:58.291 --> 46:59.541
Sure we can.

46:59.625 --> 47:01.291
I believe my sister's word.

47:01.375 --> 47:02.458
What's the plan?

47:03.250 --> 47:06.375
-I'll pay the price.
-Wait, now I'm confused.

47:06.458 --> 47:08.541
I'll play Gabriel's game, and I'll…

47:11.833 --> 47:12.916
It's Alex.

47:13.666 --> 47:15.375
-What do I do?
-Don't pick up.

47:15.458 --> 47:18.875
-Pick it up and lie.
-Buy some time, and do it your way.

47:18.958 --> 47:20.583
Which is the right way.

47:24.666 --> 47:26.291
-You've got this.
-Hi, baby!

47:26.375 --> 47:29.833
-Breathe.
-Hi, babe, good morning. How are you?

47:31.125 --> 47:33.000
How am I doing? Fine.

47:33.833 --> 47:34.833
I'm great.

47:36.708 --> 47:39.250
-Are you coming?
-I bet $50 she'll tell him to fuck off.

47:39.333 --> 47:40.666
I bet $100 she'll hang up.

47:41.625 --> 47:45.250
So, babe, remember I told you I'd be late?

47:46.166 --> 47:49.125
I've had some issues,
and I'll be there way later.

47:49.208 --> 47:52.041
-Maybe in the evening.
-Well, that's okay.

47:52.583 --> 47:53.666
That's okay.

47:53.750 --> 47:56.291
I'm usually the one who says that.

47:56.375 --> 47:59.333
-Babe, someone's calling me.
-Come. Yeah.

47:59.416 --> 48:01.250
Bye! Bye-bye.

48:03.166 --> 48:05.416
She didn't tell me to fuck off
or hang up on me.

48:05.500 --> 48:07.416
-That's a relief.
-That's weird.

48:08.500 --> 48:12.375
-Maybe something's happened.
-Of course not. Don't worry.

48:12.458 --> 48:14.375
We're almost at the car rental.

48:18.708 --> 48:20.500
Beto, the guy has a shotgun…

48:20.583 --> 48:23.208
-What? What is this place?
-Is that a shotgun?

48:23.791 --> 48:26.250
30H BEFORE THE WEDDING

48:30.458 --> 48:33.833
Is this a car rental
or an auto wrecker for stolen cars?

48:33.916 --> 48:36.875
I was in a hurry.
I thought it'd be rude to ask.

48:36.958 --> 48:39.958
-You know we're dead, right?
-We're so dead.

48:52.125 --> 48:54.250
It smells weird.
Is there a problem, Uncle?

48:54.333 --> 48:56.250
Nothing but problems, it seems.

48:59.666 --> 49:00.541
It stopped.

49:07.291 --> 49:11.000
Rest now, my boy. You tried your best.

49:21.500 --> 49:22.541
Oh my God.

49:24.500 --> 49:26.083
This is enough.

49:28.916 --> 49:31.416
Damn, I've never seen so much money.

49:31.500 --> 49:33.875
Oh God, I shouldn't be doing this.

49:34.375 --> 49:36.083
-Doing what?
-Mom?

49:36.875 --> 49:39.208
Mom, we're thinking about taking Eva…

49:39.708 --> 49:41.750
-On a boat ride.
-Scuba diving.

49:41.833 --> 49:45.791
On a boat ride and then scuba lessons
so she can relax.

49:47.458 --> 49:49.625
A day before the wedding?

49:54.291 --> 49:55.416
Great idea.

49:56.750 --> 49:58.500
Now, kids,

49:58.583 --> 50:01.708
don't forget to lock the safe, okay?

50:02.666 --> 50:06.166
Have a nice ride. Enjoy it.

50:06.250 --> 50:07.458
-Thanks.
-Mom?

50:11.750 --> 50:13.041
I need you.

50:16.750 --> 50:18.541
Oh, honey,

50:19.208 --> 50:20.916
Mommy's here.

50:22.208 --> 50:27.083
This house needs some color.
Isn't this Bahia? What's wrong with that?

50:28.041 --> 50:31.416
-There's no other way!
-I'll have Gabriel arrested!

50:31.500 --> 50:33.250
Shouldn't we call the cops?

50:33.333 --> 50:34.833
But I need proof, Mom.

50:34.916 --> 50:37.250
This could ruin my wedding.

50:39.166 --> 50:41.333
Heck. All this because of a kiss.

50:41.916 --> 50:44.416
And maybe some other things too.

50:44.500 --> 50:46.791
-We'll have to steal his phone!
-Come on, girls.

50:46.875 --> 50:47.791
This is blackmail.

50:47.875 --> 50:50.041
We'll have to steal his phone.
It's the only way.

50:50.625 --> 50:53.000
30H BEFORE THE WEDDING

51:07.416 --> 51:09.333
The mechanic seemed trustworthy.

51:10.333 --> 51:12.583
So trustworthy we're stuck in this hole.

51:12.666 --> 51:16.583
Look, I've tried everywhere.
There's no reception at all.

51:18.833 --> 51:19.666
Oof…

51:20.458 --> 51:24.125
My throat is dry.
My skin feels like sandpaper.

51:24.208 --> 51:27.250
My stomach is growling.

51:27.333 --> 51:30.875
I'm desperate. I'm half-starved.
I'm in disgrace.

51:30.958 --> 51:34.125
We'll have to resort to cannibalism.

51:37.333 --> 51:39.916
Mad Dog thought you had stolen the car.

51:40.583 --> 51:42.833
You look like a thug.

51:42.916 --> 51:45.750
-It was a misunderstanding.
-But we'll handle it.

51:45.833 --> 51:47.041
How much is it?

51:49.125 --> 51:50.791
"How much is it", huh?

51:55.416 --> 51:56.250
Well…

51:58.708 --> 52:00.416
Do you take credit cards?

52:00.500 --> 52:01.916
-No.
-Wire transfer?

52:03.583 --> 52:04.916
Wire transfer?

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
Cash.

52:06.500 --> 52:08.416
Dough. Moola.

52:09.083 --> 52:13.083
Sir, we're kinda low on funds right now.

52:13.166 --> 52:15.166
Is there another way to handle it?

52:19.500 --> 52:20.875
Let's call the cops.

52:20.958 --> 52:22.958
-There's no need.
-We can handle it.

52:23.041 --> 52:26.833
-We're no thieves, dude.
-Not thieves.

52:27.750 --> 52:30.125
-Drug dealers.
-What the hell are you talking about?

52:30.208 --> 52:31.125
Are you insane?

52:31.208 --> 52:34.958
-Where did you get that idea from?
-What about this?

52:36.083 --> 52:37.416
What is this?

52:37.500 --> 52:39.875
It's just sweets. Fancy stuff.

52:39.958 --> 52:42.333
-Fancy…
-Are they from Pure Love Ranch?

52:42.416 --> 52:44.500
We know what they grow there.

52:44.583 --> 52:45.583
What the fuck, Beto?

52:46.416 --> 52:48.291
I beg your pardon?

52:48.375 --> 52:49.958
Are they from Pure Love?

52:50.041 --> 52:53.291
I can't believe people do that
and use the word "love".

52:53.375 --> 52:55.958
Those peaceful people from the ranch?
No way.

52:56.041 --> 52:59.500
Tell it to the sheriff, buddy.
I'll call him.

52:59.583 --> 53:01.333
-Fuck, Beto!
-Hold on, Alex.

53:01.416 --> 53:03.958
-Can I? I'll call.
-No, Beto. No.

53:04.041 --> 53:06.291
Every time you fuck up, I have to fix it.

53:06.375 --> 53:08.958
-Drugs in our car?
-It's not our car.

53:09.041 --> 53:12.125
-It's a rental we didn't even pay for.
-What happens now?

53:12.208 --> 53:15.666
We could go to jail.
The headline will say "user" and "dealer".

53:15.750 --> 53:16.583
Are you happy?

53:16.666 --> 53:19.375
No, bro, I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking. I didn't…

53:19.458 --> 53:22.625
That's precisely why
nothing changes for you, bro.

53:22.708 --> 53:24.958
And you accidentally screw us.

53:25.041 --> 53:26.541
Relax, people!

53:26.625 --> 53:27.583
"Relax"?

53:28.458 --> 53:30.333
Are you asking me to relax, Beto?

53:31.041 --> 53:34.000
I'm sick of people telling me to relax!

53:34.083 --> 53:36.875
"Relax, Alex"! "Don't run, Alex"!
"Don't cry, Alex"!

53:37.791 --> 53:39.541
I just wanted to get married, dude!

53:40.041 --> 53:43.375
Now I may not get married
thanks to this shit. Are you happy?

53:43.458 --> 53:47.166
Of course not.
The sweets were for the wedding.

53:47.250 --> 53:49.041
I was broke.
Is that what you want to hear?

53:49.125 --> 53:52.750
I made a deal with the ranch guys
to surprise my friend.

53:55.208 --> 53:56.625
You're right.

53:57.833 --> 54:00.708
I didn't think. I never do.
I'm a piece of shit.

54:01.208 --> 54:02.041
That's it.

54:02.125 --> 54:04.541
Sorry, bro. I'm reckless.

54:04.625 --> 54:06.500
You don't know what that means, Beto.

54:10.583 --> 54:11.791
You're right.

54:12.416 --> 54:15.458
I really don't,
but I don't want to do you wrong anymore.

54:17.250 --> 54:18.791
Forgive me, bro, please.

54:24.458 --> 54:25.500
"Wedding"?

54:26.083 --> 54:27.833
-Are you the bride?
-Groomsmaid.

54:28.416 --> 54:29.833
The bride is waiting.

54:29.916 --> 54:31.250
But if the cops come,

54:31.333 --> 54:35.041
I'm not sure if she'll be down
to wait five to 15 years, got it?

54:35.125 --> 54:38.875
If your buddy didn't pay for them,
there's no crime, right?

54:40.083 --> 54:41.500
Okay, I get it.

54:42.125 --> 54:44.291
I'll think of another solution.

54:45.250 --> 54:46.125
I have one.

54:50.333 --> 54:51.166
May I?

54:58.375 --> 55:00.916
Shit. I had it, but now it's gone.

55:01.541 --> 55:02.875
I have an idea, Sofia.

55:02.958 --> 55:04.250
-Come here.
-What?

55:04.333 --> 55:05.625
-Come with me.
-No. Wait.

55:05.708 --> 55:07.750
Hold on. What the hell? Careful.

55:07.833 --> 55:10.416
-We'd be super tall.
-Wait. No.

55:10.500 --> 55:12.416
-Here. I did it.
-What?

55:13.500 --> 55:15.541
Hello? Alex?

55:17.958 --> 55:20.125
The truth is I just wanted to protect Eva.

55:20.791 --> 55:23.791
But I screwed up, lied,
and screwed up again.

55:24.333 --> 55:26.250
-All that because I didn't--
-Love.

55:28.125 --> 55:29.041
All that

55:30.208 --> 55:31.208
was for love.

55:32.625 --> 55:33.625
Stupidity,

55:35.125 --> 55:36.333
fear…

55:37.875 --> 55:39.083
But I understand.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.125
This "til death do us part" thing

55:43.500 --> 55:44.458
is scary.

55:47.791 --> 55:48.875
It is.

55:50.500 --> 55:51.500
Are you married?

55:52.500 --> 55:53.416
Married?

55:55.791 --> 55:57.750
No, just stupid and coward.

55:58.583 --> 55:59.916
More than you.

56:01.500 --> 56:03.958
You had the guts to propose to her.

56:04.708 --> 56:05.541
Look,

56:06.333 --> 56:07.708
there's your family.

56:10.125 --> 56:11.916
Hell yeah!

56:22.625 --> 56:24.250
-Are you single?
-Single?

56:25.166 --> 56:27.708
-How cute.
-This is all we have.

56:27.791 --> 56:29.666
They spent almost everything
with the mechanic.

56:29.750 --> 56:32.166
A crook mechanic, huh, buddy?

56:33.958 --> 56:34.791
Let's go.

56:35.333 --> 56:38.291
I know it's not enough, Mad Dog,
but if you leave us here,

56:38.375 --> 56:39.416
I risk losing--

56:39.500 --> 56:42.583
-The love of your life, I know.
-Yeah.

56:42.666 --> 56:43.958
Let's tow it, doc.

56:46.125 --> 56:48.000
I don't have tools,
but I'll figure it out.

56:48.083 --> 56:50.333
Don't worry.
Keep your money and follow me.

56:50.958 --> 56:52.666
So you're not charging us?

56:53.250 --> 56:55.458
It's a wedding gift, big boy.

56:55.541 --> 56:57.041
AUTOHELP

56:57.125 --> 56:59.041
Let's fucking go!

56:59.916 --> 57:01.166
Let's go, doc!

57:02.250 --> 57:03.250
Have a seat.

57:04.958 --> 57:05.875
Sit down.

57:08.708 --> 57:10.583
-May I?
-Take this one. It's nice.

57:10.666 --> 57:12.000
It's the good one.

57:14.541 --> 57:18.250
Where was I? Oh, the cars… No, Mad Dog…

57:18.833 --> 57:20.791
He's a skilled mechanic.

57:21.333 --> 57:24.166
It was my idea to rent cars.

57:24.250 --> 57:26.375
We've always wanted a simple life.

57:27.291 --> 57:28.791
I think he got tired.

57:29.916 --> 57:32.000
-Of working?
-Of me.

57:32.583 --> 57:35.625
-He's been so quiet, full of secrets.
-Oh.

57:36.500 --> 57:38.416
I think he's seeing another man.

57:38.500 --> 57:41.125
Oh my God.

57:41.208 --> 57:44.791
Damn, Mr. Paulistinha, come on. You…

57:44.875 --> 57:48.041
Don't be silly. You're a fighter, dude.

57:54.791 --> 57:56.916
He can fix anything,

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
but I don't know if that's fixable.

58:12.083 --> 58:13.625
I was scared.

58:16.083 --> 58:17.500
You? Scared of what?

58:24.208 --> 58:26.083
"Til death do us part."

58:30.666 --> 58:31.916
It's scary, huh?

58:47.166 --> 58:48.375
I think it's beautiful.

58:57.125 --> 58:59.750
24H BEFORE THE WEDDING

59:00.875 --> 59:02.833
-Come.
-Relax.

59:07.625 --> 59:09.125
I thought we'd be alone.

59:09.208 --> 59:10.666
You don't have to be afraid.

59:11.958 --> 59:12.791
I'm not afraid.

59:13.416 --> 59:14.750
I'm disgusted.

59:15.541 --> 59:16.708
Tatiana, do you copy?

59:16.791 --> 59:18.750
Is the drone ready and recording?

59:18.833 --> 59:20.208
Eva's already with Gabriel.

59:21.250 --> 59:22.500
It's just business.

59:22.583 --> 59:23.625
Where's the money?

59:25.625 --> 59:27.041
Where's your phone?

59:27.625 --> 59:29.916
It's there, with the pictures.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.625
He's saying it. Get closer.

59:33.625 --> 59:36.125
You can't see shit, Batista!
Give it to me.

59:37.583 --> 59:41.208
I'll give you the phone, and it's over.
Pay up so we can forget about it.

59:41.791 --> 59:43.708
Girls, the scumbag confessed!

59:44.291 --> 59:45.166
Okay.

59:46.291 --> 59:47.625
We'll forget it all right.

59:47.708 --> 59:49.666
As soon as you're in jail!

59:49.750 --> 59:51.875
-You're screwed!
-I told you to come alone.

59:51.958 --> 59:52.916
You're not my boss.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.708
You'll never do that to me
or any other woman again.

59:55.791 --> 59:57.416
Now I have proof, Gabriel!

01:00:00.416 --> 01:00:02.458
-Batista, what's going on?
-I don't know!

01:00:04.333 --> 01:00:06.416
-It's a breakdown!
-We'll lose everything!

01:00:10.958 --> 01:00:12.666
Run, Charles! Take the phone!

01:00:14.291 --> 01:00:17.000
The pictures are gone,
and so is the proof.

01:00:18.916 --> 01:00:21.166
-Pay what you owe me.
-This is what you're owed.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.708
Nice one, girl. Perfect cross.
But we need more.

01:00:25.458 --> 01:00:27.041
One more won't hurt.

01:00:27.125 --> 01:00:29.666
Enough, girls! Enough!

01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:34.291
-Here's everything I owe you.
-Stop. Stop it, Eva.

01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:35.291
Everything.

01:00:36.958 --> 01:00:39.416
Oh, and here's the money…

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:41.875
for yesterday's drink.

01:00:44.166 --> 01:00:45.500
You're gonna pay for this!

01:00:50.166 --> 01:00:52.916
Of course she'll pay. Eva must pay.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.583
Eva won't pay anything.

01:00:57.083 --> 01:00:58.041
I will.

01:01:00.166 --> 01:01:01.000
You'll pay?

01:01:03.791 --> 01:01:05.291
We needed a plan B!

01:01:05.375 --> 01:01:07.666
We could beat the hell out of the scumbag.

01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:09.291
Good idea, but what if we…

01:01:09.375 --> 01:01:11.875
Where's Eva? I need to show her this.

01:01:13.208 --> 01:01:15.250
So? Did it work?

01:01:15.333 --> 01:01:17.625
Exactly as you planned!

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.333
Can someone explain it to us?

01:01:21.416 --> 01:01:23.000
I told Carina everything.

01:01:23.083 --> 01:01:24.458
Eva won't pay anything.

01:01:25.958 --> 01:01:26.916
I will.

01:01:30.916 --> 01:01:33.916
Mission accomplished.

01:01:35.541 --> 01:01:36.958
Did you see anything?

01:01:37.625 --> 01:01:39.916
Of course not. It's your business.

01:01:42.791 --> 01:01:44.875
That's what mothers-in-law are for.

01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:50.958
21H BEFORE THE WEDDING

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:52.416
I'm here!

01:01:53.583 --> 01:01:54.666
Oh, babe.

01:01:57.791 --> 01:01:58.791
I'm so glad.

01:02:00.041 --> 01:02:01.208
I'm so glad, baby.

01:02:02.083 --> 01:02:04.583
-I have so much to tell you.
-So do I.

01:02:05.166 --> 01:02:06.291
So do I.

01:02:06.875 --> 01:02:08.708
-How's it going?
-How are you?

01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:10.250
Hey. How's it going?

01:02:11.625 --> 01:02:15.666
I couldn't remember anything,
but the pictures are in there.

01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:17.958
-And they don't lie.
-Says who?

01:02:19.125 --> 01:02:21.666
They're all edited, babe. It's all fake.

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:22.916
-All of them?
-Yep.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.916
-Even the kiss?
-Even the kiss.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.666
Just rushed, poorly-made fakes.
The person who did this should be in jail.

01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:29.583
He already is.

01:02:29.666 --> 01:02:32.791
Babe, you don't remember anything
because nothing happened.

01:02:32.875 --> 01:02:34.041
Wait, Alex.

01:02:34.625 --> 01:02:36.666
The pictures may be edited,

01:02:37.375 --> 01:02:38.458
but we did kiss.

01:02:38.541 --> 01:02:41.708
-You kissed that guy?
-Yes, at the bachelorette party.

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:44.500
-The pics are fake, but the kiss…
-Happened.

01:02:44.583 --> 01:02:48.208
-I was drunk with the girls--
-And you were mad at me for lying.

01:02:48.291 --> 01:02:52.291
Alex, I know those aren't excuses
for kissing him.

01:02:52.916 --> 01:02:54.833
But it was a meaningless kiss.

01:02:59.083 --> 01:03:01.083
But I know it's different for you.

01:03:01.875 --> 01:03:03.833
I'll understand if you…

01:03:03.916 --> 01:03:06.625
If you never want to see me again.

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:10.333
You didn't have to tell me.

01:03:11.541 --> 01:03:14.625
-What do you mean?
-I told you the pics were fake.

01:03:19.166 --> 01:03:21.416
I had to tell you.

01:03:26.791 --> 01:03:27.791
I love you, Eva.

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.750
You love me all the same?

01:03:31.833 --> 01:03:33.250
I love you even more.

01:03:35.125 --> 01:03:36.625
Eva, you're you.

01:03:37.583 --> 01:03:40.666
You face your doubts, your weaknesses.

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:43.625
You don't let anything stop you.
You just go.

01:03:44.791 --> 01:03:48.833
Eva, you're strong, transparent.
I wish I were just like you.

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:52.708
But the best I could do was
to have a woman like you by my side.

01:03:54.250 --> 01:03:56.958
Even if you were drunk and kissed your ex…

01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:02.375
Do you still want to be with me?

01:04:06.416 --> 01:04:08.333
That's all I want, baby.

01:04:24.041 --> 01:04:27.083
I love you.

01:04:32.541 --> 01:04:37.125
Since we're truth-bombing,
I also need to tell you something.

01:04:37.708 --> 01:04:38.916
What is it, Alex?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.791
I volunteered to pick up the dress
because I had an interview.

01:04:44.041 --> 01:04:46.041
-That's great, babe.
-Great?

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:48.625
-How was it?
-Babe, I caused all this mess.

01:04:48.708 --> 01:04:51.541
I left you alone and almost ruined
the wedding because I lied.

01:04:51.625 --> 01:04:53.166
So I wouldn't stress out.

01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:55.583
-That's no excuse.
-Don't tell anyone.

01:04:56.291 --> 01:04:58.166
But it's the best excuse ever.

01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:59.916
Baby!

01:05:00.875 --> 01:05:01.833
-That's great.
-Oh.

01:05:02.583 --> 01:05:04.708
Damn, I thought you'd kill me

01:05:04.791 --> 01:05:07.708
when you found out
I was late to pick up the dress.

01:05:08.583 --> 01:05:10.166
-You what?
-But I did get it.

01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:11.166
Then I lost it.

01:05:12.083 --> 01:05:15.083
-You…
-But I got it back. It's safe and sound.

01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:18.541
Are you trying to give me
a heart attack, babe?

01:05:18.625 --> 01:05:20.875
-What a relief.
-Oof.

01:05:22.041 --> 01:05:23.041
I can't believe it.

01:05:25.541 --> 01:05:27.666
-Alex?
-Yes, baby?

01:05:28.791 --> 01:05:29.958
-Alex?
-Yeah?

01:05:31.041 --> 01:05:32.458
Take a look.

01:05:33.041 --> 01:05:36.041
After all that,
I won't look and ruin our wedding.

01:05:36.125 --> 01:05:37.416
You can look, Alex.

01:05:39.458 --> 01:05:40.750
The dress…

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:43.625
is already ruined!

01:05:48.916 --> 01:05:50.333
Shall we jump over it?

01:05:50.416 --> 01:05:53.875
Do it!

01:05:55.583 --> 01:05:57.375
Shit I saw the dress.

01:05:57.458 --> 01:05:59.833
Baby, I didn't remember. Dear God…

01:06:00.416 --> 01:06:01.750
It was beautiful.

01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:03.375
It was. I mean…

01:06:03.458 --> 01:06:06.083
-There's nothing left.
-Baby, I'm sorry.

01:06:06.166 --> 01:06:07.166
It's over.

01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:09.625
-What? What's over?
-There's no other way.

01:06:09.708 --> 01:06:12.166
-What do you mean?
-You'll have to jump into the abyss.

01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:13.708
-What?
-Face the beast.

01:06:13.791 --> 01:06:16.083
Convince Tatiana to give me her dress!

01:06:16.166 --> 01:06:18.416
-She'll kill me!
-It's possible.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.166
But if you make it, we can get married.

01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:24.208
You know what? I'll make it.
We'll get married.

01:06:24.291 --> 01:06:26.250
And we'll live happily ever after.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I hope so.

01:06:28.958 --> 01:06:30.000
Hang on.

01:06:31.875 --> 01:06:33.125
8:13 PM
SUZANA

01:06:33.208 --> 01:06:34.500
Who's Suzana, Alex?

01:06:34.583 --> 01:06:37.583
She's the CEO of the gaming company.
I'll call back later.

01:06:37.666 --> 01:06:40.291
Are you insane? Listen to it, Alex.

01:06:44.583 --> 01:06:45.958
All set, Alex.

01:06:46.041 --> 01:06:50.333
Come by tomorrow to sign the contract.
You can move to London this week.

01:06:50.416 --> 01:06:52.125
Bye. Good luck.

01:06:53.375 --> 01:06:54.666
London?

01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:58.875
Yeah. I forgot to tell you this detail.
It's in London, so forget it.

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:00.458
"Forget it"?

01:07:00.541 --> 01:07:02.833
-Yeah.
-Why forget it?

01:07:02.916 --> 01:07:04.250
-"Why"?
-Because of me?

01:07:04.333 --> 01:07:07.250
Of course. I love you.
I won't abandon our life for--

01:07:07.333 --> 01:07:10.125
-For your biggest dream.
-You're my biggest dream.

01:07:10.208 --> 01:07:11.625
What we have is real.

01:07:11.708 --> 01:07:14.083
And reality is not perfect.

01:07:14.625 --> 01:07:16.666
Will you be left
with another imaginary life?

01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:21.625
No love can survive that, Alex.

01:07:21.708 --> 01:07:25.458
I'll have to be there for three months,
a year, or God knows how long.

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:28.791
We could get lost in the way
and never find each other again.

01:07:28.875 --> 01:07:30.000
It's possible.

01:07:31.416 --> 01:07:34.250
But there's no other way, Alex.

01:07:43.291 --> 01:07:45.166
I have something to ask you.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:52.541
Will you…

01:07:54.166 --> 01:07:55.333
Don't do that, Eva.

01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:57.791
Will you…

01:07:58.750 --> 01:08:00.166
not marry me?

01:08:10.333 --> 01:08:11.458
I love you.

01:08:16.541 --> 01:08:20.000
People get married
to make sure their love is eternal.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.833
As if a ring or a certificate

01:08:24.916 --> 01:08:28.833
would get you
a happily ever after diploma.

01:08:29.833 --> 01:08:32.583
But no one knows
what will actually happen.

01:08:33.875 --> 01:08:35.625
We chose to get married for love.

01:08:36.583 --> 01:08:40.291
But my love for Alex was greater
than my desire to marry him.

01:09:17.708 --> 01:09:19.500
LONDON

01:09:19.583 --> 01:09:21.250
9,496KM FROM SÃO PAULO

01:09:51.291 --> 01:09:54.000
Damn it. I ruined everything.

01:09:54.083 --> 01:09:56.375
Don't give up. It's the last level.

01:09:57.375 --> 01:09:58.291
All right, then.

01:09:59.333 --> 01:10:00.166
Damn.

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:02.125
I haven't heard much from you lately.

01:10:02.208 --> 01:10:03.625
I've been kinda busy.

01:10:04.208 --> 01:10:05.041
Yeah?

01:10:05.833 --> 01:10:07.750
Have you met someone?

01:10:07.833 --> 01:10:08.666
Maybe.

01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:10.375
Who is it, Alex? Spit it out.

01:10:10.458 --> 01:10:13.708
The company's president.
The game is ready for launch.

01:10:13.791 --> 01:10:14.625
Nice.

01:10:15.291 --> 01:10:17.250
Now let's do it together.

01:10:17.916 --> 01:10:18.750
One,

01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:20.541
two…

01:10:21.291 --> 01:10:22.125
Go!

01:10:25.916 --> 01:10:26.958
Congratulations.

01:10:27.958 --> 01:10:29.041
How nice.

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.791
When's the launch?

01:10:32.875 --> 01:10:34.541
As soon as I return to São Paulo.

01:10:35.708 --> 01:10:38.791
-What?
-I'm the creative director in Brazil now.

01:10:39.541 --> 01:10:40.416
What do you mean?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.250
When are you coming?

01:10:43.958 --> 01:10:46.791
Alex!

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:20.750
Will you marry me?

01:11:24.125 --> 01:11:25.958
Of course I will.

01:11:26.041 --> 01:11:27.083
Now.

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:28.625
-Now?
-Yeah.

01:11:28.708 --> 01:11:32.166
-I can't wait another minute.
-I don't have a dress.

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:33.250
I brought one.

01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:36.916
-The dress.
-Tatiana helped. Eunice made another one.

01:11:38.708 --> 01:11:41.250
But you didn't see this one, did you?

01:11:42.250 --> 01:11:43.333
Not this time.

01:11:45.541 --> 01:11:46.916
-Wait for me.
-Sure.

01:11:49.083 --> 01:11:50.083
I'll be quick.

01:11:55.291 --> 01:11:58.416
In London, away from everything,
I reconsidered my entire life.

01:11:58.958 --> 01:12:02.375
Was my dream of getting married stupid?
Kid stuff?

01:12:03.125 --> 01:12:04.541
The answer was no.

01:12:05.041 --> 01:12:08.291
But now I wanted a wedding
with the important things only.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.083
Me and Eva.

01:12:10.166 --> 01:12:12.166
As a family law attorney…

01:12:12.250 --> 01:12:14.500
Her expertise is divorce, okay?

01:12:14.583 --> 01:12:17.416
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

01:12:18.041 --> 01:12:21.291
-You may kiss the bride.
-Do it. French kiss her.

01:12:21.375 --> 01:12:22.708
Let me see those tongues.

01:12:30.291 --> 01:12:34.083
When I suggested calling off the wedding,
I was scared.

01:12:34.166 --> 01:12:37.291
Of how people would react.
Of losing him forever.

01:12:37.375 --> 01:12:39.083
But that's life.

01:12:39.958 --> 01:12:42.208
It's like my dad always says,

01:12:42.708 --> 01:12:46.208
"we can't be ashamed of being happy."

01:12:46.291 --> 01:12:49.250
MARRIED AT LAST!

01:19:17.583 --> 01:19:22.583
