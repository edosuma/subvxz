12:44.981 --> 12:46.243
It's all right. I can do it.

12:46.678 --> 12:48.550
No, I can open my own beer.THOMAS: I'm just...
I'm just saying.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.726
Try again.BEN: Super tight.

12:50.857 --> 12:51.771
Very tight.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.773
Ow! But I did it.THOMAS: There you go.

12:53.860 --> 12:54.904
You did it.MARGARET: Oh, wow.

12:54.991 --> 12:56.427
You did it in, uh,
in your own way.

12:56.514 --> 12:58.299
That's fantastic.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.910
Yay? BEN: I guess you just got
to do it harder.

13:01.084 --> 13:03.260
You got to do it harder.
There you go, man.

13:03.391 --> 13:05.132
Oh, cheers.ELLIE: College.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.047
Babe, come on.

13:07.482 --> 13:08.700
Do you really have to keep
doing that

13:08.788 --> 13:09.919
on someone else's furniture?

13:12.052 --> 13:13.880
No, yeah, you're right.
Uh, that would be...

13:14.794 --> 13:15.751
so inappropriate.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.633
Hey,
you want to go,

13:28.764 --> 13:30.070
um, toss some horseshoes?Yep.

13:30.157 --> 13:31.767
Uh, wh... okay.

13:37.947 --> 13:40.297
Ellie, would you like to help me
make a salad?

13:41.733 --> 13:42.952
Sure.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.436
Okay,
I chop, you spill.

13:48.523 --> 13:50.307
It's... honestly, it's nothing.

13:50.525 --> 13:52.135
He's been acting so weird

13:52.222 --> 13:54.094
since we got here.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.444
You, too. So out with it.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.968
I really, really shouldn't.

13:59.316 --> 14:00.578
"Oh, I really shouldn't."

14:00.709 --> 14:04.365
You want to tell me so bad.
Look at you.

14:04.626 --> 14:08.108
Plus, you know, it might...
might make you feel better.

14:11.241 --> 14:13.243
Okay, we're gonna need
some drinks.

14:14.375 --> 14:15.419
Wine.Yeah.

14:16.029 --> 14:18.118
Hey, about this morning,
can't thank you enough.

14:18.248 --> 14:19.597
Ah, dude, it was nothing.

14:20.163 --> 14:24.124
Um, so Spencer...
he's a little crazy.

14:24.472 --> 14:26.213
Oh, he's a lunatic. Absolutely.

14:26.343 --> 14:29.042
But you're great with him.
Uncle Ben.

14:29.172 --> 14:30.130
Eh.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.001
So?

14:32.828 --> 14:34.047
When are you, uh,
when are you guys

14:34.134 --> 14:35.135
gonna have your own?

14:35.222 --> 14:36.919
Uh, I... you know.

14:37.311 --> 14:39.966
I don't know that we're really
quite ready for that yet, so...

14:40.096 --> 14:41.358
Bro, nobody's ever ready.

14:41.489 --> 14:42.490
Like, I think of our parents,

14:42.838 --> 14:44.666
and I'm surprised
we even made it to adulthood.

14:44.796 --> 14:47.495
No, you just got to,
you got to jump in.

14:47.669 --> 14:50.672
Headfirst. De cabeza.

14:53.022 --> 14:56.069
So, Kyle...Mm-hmm.

14:58.462 --> 14:59.724
...and Katie?

15:00.595 --> 15:01.639
Mm-hmm.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.033
How exactly did that work?

15:04.120 --> 15:05.992
A lot of alcohol.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.863
And the kids
were at my parents'.

15:07.994 --> 15:10.213
I can't believe Katie.
Kyle maybe.

15:10.344 --> 15:11.867
Oh, Kyle definitely.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.869
But, I mean, you know,
they got married after college

15:13.956 --> 15:15.088
just like Thomas and me.

15:15.262 --> 15:17.220
W... Was it just,
like, all of you

15:17.307 --> 15:18.787
in one big, like...

15:20.136 --> 15:21.311
blob or...

15:23.444 --> 15:24.619
I want details.

15:24.749 --> 15:27.100
I need another sip.

15:28.840 --> 15:32.496
So you and Kyle are on the bed.

15:32.627 --> 15:35.151
And where are Thomas and Katie
during all this?

15:35.282 --> 15:37.893
Uh, on the chair in the corner.Mm-hmm.

15:38.589 --> 15:40.243
That little blue one?

15:40.548 --> 15:41.462
Okay.

15:41.897 --> 15:44.508
And so, she's, like,
sitting in Thomas's lap...

15:44.595 --> 15:45.857
Mm-hmm....her back to me

15:45.945 --> 15:48.469
clothes still on, mind you.Mm-hmm.

15:48.599 --> 15:53.778
And Thomas, you know,
starts kissing her neck,

15:53.909 --> 15:56.607
and then looks over
her shoulder at me,

15:56.694 --> 15:58.870
and it just felt like,

15:59.001 --> 16:02.396
"This is it. Let's... let's go."

16:04.833 --> 16:07.140
I'm not opposed to it
in theory.

16:07.314 --> 16:10.404
It's more... in practice
I'm not so sure about.

16:10.578 --> 16:11.666
Uh-huh.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.321
You do know you still have fun
when you have kids, right?

16:15.757 --> 16:18.020
It's just slightly
different fun.

16:18.281 --> 16:21.937
I like kids.
We both like kids. It's just...

16:22.068 --> 16:24.940
It's kind of like
the high-end Airbnb, you know?

16:25.071 --> 16:27.464
It's great for the weekend,
just...

16:27.595 --> 16:29.945
not so sure
it's really our lifestyle.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.034
Yeah, you'd be surprised
how your lifestyle can change.

16:32.165 --> 16:33.427
Is it hard?

16:34.080 --> 16:36.647
Sometimes, sure,
but it's the best thing, man.

16:36.778 --> 16:37.997
Mm.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.304
Sometimes it feels like
it's the only thing.

16:43.524 --> 16:48.355
So things...
progress between Kyle and me.

16:48.485 --> 16:51.793
Okay, like, you took
your clothes off or...

16:51.967 --> 16:53.142
Mm-hmm.

16:55.188 --> 16:57.799
Ellie. Did you guys actually...

16:57.929 --> 16:59.018
Oh, we fucked.

17:03.848 --> 17:06.634
And?

17:06.938 --> 17:08.549
And it was great.

17:09.202 --> 17:11.595
Until I look over
at Thomas and Katie,

17:11.726 --> 17:14.685
and they're just watching us,
sort of...

17:15.686 --> 17:18.689
I don't know, like,
half-heartedly canoodling.

17:19.386 --> 17:20.300
Canoodling?

17:20.430 --> 17:23.564
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, it was weird, Margo.

17:23.912 --> 17:26.045
But did you finish?

17:26.567 --> 17:30.223
So, I told Thomas
that I faked it.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.661
Off the fucking charts.

17:33.791 --> 17:36.185
Okay, Kyle.

17:36.316 --> 17:38.274
Yes.

17:38.405 --> 17:42.496
And so it's been weird
ever since.

17:42.583 --> 17:45.064
Mm-hmm.
I mean, you saw. I just...

17:45.673 --> 17:49.503
I don't know. I... I feel like
I cheated on him or something.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.245
He'll get over it.Mm.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.725
Like, he hasn't
touched me since.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.946
To be fair, you know,
it's just been busy with work...Hmm.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.035
...and the kids and my parents.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.559
We haven't really
had any time to ourselves.

18:03.386 --> 18:07.086
Well, why don't the kids
just stay here tonight?

18:08.565 --> 18:09.566
Could they?

18:09.958 --> 18:11.873
I mean, I don't see why not.

18:12.003 --> 18:13.483
Ben actually seems
to kind of like

18:13.570 --> 18:14.789
having them around.

18:15.006 --> 18:16.747
Yes, he does, doesn't he?

18:16.878 --> 18:18.140
Don't get any ideas.

18:18.358 --> 18:19.794
We're still not
having any of our own.

18:19.924 --> 18:21.056
Mm.

18:21.274 --> 18:23.493
You know, we're focusing
on our careers right now,

18:23.580 --> 18:26.235
and we're not kid people
at the end of the day.

18:26.366 --> 18:28.542
We like to go out
on a whim and travel

18:28.672 --> 18:30.500
and, you know, all the stuff
you and I used to do

18:30.587 --> 18:31.632
before you...

18:32.676 --> 18:34.591
Before I had kids.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.377
You know what I mean.

18:39.509 --> 18:42.773
Well, maybe it's for the best,
you know?

18:47.387 --> 18:49.084
A double Cancer?

18:49.215 --> 18:50.825
Yep, the other one's
a Cancer, too.

18:50.955 --> 18:52.827
It's just... it's not
common when you're, like,

18:52.914 --> 18:55.090
a triple of one sign.

18:55.221 --> 18:56.439
Is it a bad sign?

18:56.570 --> 18:58.833
Yes. BEN: Uh, focus. Oh! Hey.

18:58.963 --> 19:00.443
All right. Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Careful, dude.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.097
You're gonna whack yourself
in the head, okay?

19:02.184 --> 19:04.099
Look, took me a while
to figure it out,

19:04.534 --> 19:06.797
but you'll get the hang of it.
Just practice.

19:06.928 --> 19:09.104
You're doing great. Um, just...

19:13.456 --> 19:15.719
Ah, you... I know.
It's just frustrating.

19:15.850 --> 19:18.113
Great. No. Ooh, watch your face.
Ooh, sh...

19:18.331 --> 19:19.767
All right, go get them.

19:19.854 --> 19:22.683
I was thinking maybe the kids
could stay with us tonight.

19:23.640 --> 19:24.685
Say what?

19:25.294 --> 19:27.340
That's a great idea.

19:29.951 --> 19:32.432
Yeah. Sure. That should be fun.

19:33.346 --> 19:35.478
Won't that be fun, guys?
A little sleepover?

19:36.000 --> 19:40.570
You guys can stay...
Okay?

19:41.223 --> 19:43.182
Can I get
some verbal confirmation?

19:45.662 --> 19:47.403
No, that's all right.
You don't have to turn around.

19:47.534 --> 19:49.884
Uh, yeah, I think
we've already been replaced.

19:50.014 --> 19:51.451
Mm-hmm.BEN: That's it.

19:51.625 --> 19:52.887
Okay. Okay, okay.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.542
Okay. Hand them over.

19:57.065 --> 19:58.022
Hold my beer.

20:00.808 --> 20:04.333
Devil sticks. See?
Just finesse, finesse.

20:04.420 --> 20:05.726
You just got to feel
them sticks.

20:05.900 --> 20:07.162
Give it a flippity flip.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.425
Okay? You want to see
the helicopter?

20:12.602 --> 20:14.387
How about them hot moves?

20:14.517 --> 20:18.217
Yeah? Yeah? See how easy?
Remember the balance?

20:19.043 --> 20:22.046
Just keep practicing,
and you will get the hang of it.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.571
Promise.
Well, I'm about ready to go.

20:26.094 --> 20:27.835
Right now?Mm-hmm.

20:27.922 --> 20:29.532
Okay? Yeah?Yeah.

20:31.708 --> 20:34.494
All right, kids,
we're gonna go, so be good.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.061
So, this
is the simple stuff.

20:37.192 --> 20:38.454
It's for babies, okay?

20:38.585 --> 20:39.890
Once you get good,

20:39.977 --> 20:42.545
you start doing the flips, okay?

20:42.676 --> 20:43.807
Oh!MARGARET: Ooh.

20:44.112 --> 20:45.592
Nice. Demon Sword.BEN: Wait, I have a Demon Sword.

20:45.853 --> 20:47.507
Uh, wait,
so can I play now...

20:47.594 --> 20:49.422
...that he's put his card down
or do we have to wait...

20:49.509 --> 20:51.250
You can't do that.MARGARET: You had two
Demon Swords?

20:51.337 --> 20:52.729
I'm gonna referee.You can't do that.

20:52.903 --> 20:54.122
There's no order.
This isn't Uno.

20:54.688 --> 20:56.385
Guys, it's...
it's not that complicated.

20:56.603 --> 21:00.084
Unless you get the Rabid Queen.
That changes everything.

21:00.215 --> 21:01.738
Ooh, what happens
if you get the Rabid Queen?

21:01.869 --> 21:02.826
Yeah, what happens?

21:02.957 --> 21:04.306
You don't want to know.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.483
We just asked.Here.

21:07.918 --> 21:09.877
Moving on. I'm playing this one.

21:10.138 --> 21:11.487
Normally,
you put the thing there.

21:11.618 --> 21:13.402
Here?LUCY: No. Let me...

21:14.142 --> 21:15.404
Quiero volver.

21:15.535 --> 21:17.014
What's up?

21:17.145 --> 21:20.235
Quiero volver.I don't know. What's that mean?

21:20.366 --> 21:21.845
He wants to go back.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.501
Back where?LUCY: The bright place.

21:26.154 --> 21:28.504
The place that shines.
In the woods.

21:28.896 --> 21:30.158
Oh, that old fort?

21:30.332 --> 21:31.899
Nah, dude, I don't think
we're gonna go back there.

21:31.986 --> 21:33.640
Ah, we got lots of fun things
we can do here,

21:33.727 --> 21:35.337
like teach you some new tricks
with your sticks.

21:35.511 --> 21:37.426
See if you can pick those up.

21:37.557 --> 21:39.341
I got a lot of cool stuff...

21:47.697 --> 21:49.133
Sounds great, Ben.

21:49.264 --> 21:51.571
I'm gonna pull.
I feel like...Okay.

21:52.267 --> 21:54.313
Oh, shit!Good.

21:54.443 --> 21:56.576
I got the Serpentine Lord.BEN: Mm.

21:56.706 --> 21:58.578
That's bad, right?You swore.

21:59.143 --> 22:00.406
Um...

22:00.623 --> 22:02.886
if I give you 20 bucks,
will you not tell your mom?

22:03.017 --> 22:04.453
You're bribing children now?

22:06.934 --> 22:08.762
Guys, let's just play this game.

22:08.979 --> 22:10.111
Yeah, sorry.I win.

22:16.683 --> 22:17.771
MARGARET:
We'll be right out here

22:17.858 --> 22:19.250
if you need anything, okay?

22:19.990 --> 22:22.558
Do you want the door open
or closed?

22:22.993 --> 22:25.256
Closed.Okay. Good night.

22:32.220 --> 22:33.482
They're out like a light.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.006
That wasn't so bad.

22:37.094 --> 22:38.313
Kids are fine.

22:38.574 --> 22:40.489
It's what it does to the parents
that I don't like.

22:41.316 --> 22:42.709
You talking about Thomas?

22:43.144 --> 22:44.319
No, I'm talking about
both of them.

22:44.406 --> 22:45.799
They were at each other's
throats all day.

22:47.757 --> 22:51.370
Well, that is not
the kids' fault.

22:52.806 --> 22:55.591
Wait, wait, wait.
What do you know?

22:56.897 --> 22:58.289
What aren't you telling me?

23:00.553 --> 23:02.685
Why don't we enjoy
the night air?

23:03.425 --> 23:05.427
Okay.

23:09.475 --> 23:11.477
Wow. Just wow.

23:11.564 --> 23:13.130
I know.

23:13.914 --> 23:15.306
Kyle I can see, but...

23:15.481 --> 23:16.569
Right?

23:16.656 --> 23:18.571
Makes me wonder about

23:18.701 --> 23:21.138
all those date nights
my parents had when I was a kid.

23:30.496 --> 23:31.453
What?

23:32.454 --> 23:33.716
Do you want kids?

23:33.934 --> 23:36.502
What?

23:37.807 --> 23:38.808
I...

23:40.506 --> 23:41.637
I mean...

23:42.682 --> 23:44.814
well, you kind of decided
this for us.

23:44.945 --> 23:46.033
See, that.

23:47.426 --> 23:51.430
That there.
I made the decision, not us.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.042
You know, I see how great
you are with Lucy and Spencer,

23:55.129 --> 23:56.347
and I just...

23:56.522 --> 23:59.525
I wonder if it's something
I'm keeping you from.

23:59.873 --> 24:01.788
You know? Like, I just...
I want to make sure

24:01.875 --> 24:04.443
that we're still
on the same page.

24:07.097 --> 24:09.056
Look, we don't have to decide
tonight, all right?

24:09.143 --> 24:10.536
We've got time.

24:10.666 --> 24:13.103
I mean, you got time.
I have an expiration date.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.498
Fair enough. Okay.

24:16.803 --> 24:18.587
Okay.

24:19.414 --> 24:21.982
You want to talk about it?
Let's talk about it.

24:25.768 --> 24:28.423
I mean, yes.
I don't... I don't know. I...

24:29.772 --> 24:31.121
I just don't want to feel like

24:31.208 --> 24:33.210
I'm the only person
that has to figure it out.

24:35.038 --> 24:36.344
What do you mean by that?

24:41.305 --> 24:42.306
Never mind.

24:44.874 --> 24:47.877
Okay.

24:52.969 --> 24:55.668
Oh, I just feel
so real right now.

24:55.755 --> 25:00.324
What do you mean?Like... connected.

25:00.411 --> 25:02.892
That's the word.
I feel connected.

25:03.937 --> 25:05.504
Connected to what?

25:07.027 --> 25:10.378
This. This... fire.

25:10.944 --> 25:13.120
These trees, these bugs.

25:13.207 --> 25:17.254
Um, I want to feel this way
all the time.

25:17.341 --> 25:19.213
I just feel like
I'm a part of everything,

25:19.300 --> 25:21.998
like everything is connected

25:22.085 --> 25:24.784
and it's bigger than me,
you know?

25:24.871 --> 25:28.048
And you think about the city
and how disjointed it is,

25:28.135 --> 25:29.484
and... I don't know.

25:29.571 --> 25:31.051
When I think about it
sometimes,

25:31.181 --> 25:34.489
it just makes me...

25:36.447 --> 25:40.626
Love... you are very high.

25:43.106 --> 25:45.239
No.Oh, no, I... I promise.

25:45.369 --> 25:47.197
You got to trust me on this one.

25:47.284 --> 25:50.113
I'm a little high.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.593
You're high as hell.

25:51.854 --> 25:53.595
Come here. Okay.

25:53.682 --> 25:56.076
Let's feel connected.

25:58.252 --> 26:01.255
I'll take that.I'm a one-hit wonder.

26:01.342 --> 26:02.909
You took like six hits.

26:34.331 --> 26:36.246
Oh, good morning.

26:36.551 --> 26:38.597
Here you go.

26:39.554 --> 26:41.556
Mm, thank you.BEN: Yeah.

26:44.341 --> 26:46.474
You look incredible
this morning.

26:46.692 --> 26:48.258
You're a liar.

26:51.522 --> 26:53.568
Do we have Advil?

26:54.743 --> 26:56.702
Yeah. We do.

26:57.964 --> 27:01.576
You're a saint, you know that?

27:21.596 --> 27:23.467
Yes. Get it, girl.

27:34.043 --> 27:35.305
The kids awake?

27:35.436 --> 27:37.264
No, they're, uh, still
sleeping, I think.

27:40.136 --> 27:42.225
Lucky they sleep so late.

27:45.707 --> 27:47.970
Rise and shine, sleepyheads.

27:55.761 --> 27:57.197
Lucy? Spencer?

27:57.719 --> 28:01.070
I think I can convince Ben
to make us some pancakes.

28:03.159 --> 28:05.335
Luce? Spencer?

28:07.642 --> 28:09.818
I'm gonna open the door, okay?

28:21.308 --> 28:22.526
They're not in there.

28:23.049 --> 28:25.616
Did you check the bathroom?Mm-hmm. Yeah.

28:26.617 --> 28:29.142
Uh, maybe they're just playing
outside or something.

28:41.763 --> 28:43.243
I don't see them out there.

28:43.939 --> 28:45.027
Really?

28:45.854 --> 28:47.726
Maybe they're, um...
Go check and see

28:47.813 --> 28:49.031
if they're playing
over by the pond.

29:08.181 --> 29:09.573
You don't see them?

29:12.707 --> 29:15.536
Huh.

29:18.278 --> 29:20.715
Okay, I'm freaking out.

29:21.150 --> 29:22.369
No, no. You know what?

29:22.543 --> 29:24.806
Remember they were playing
hide-and-seek yesterday?

29:25.067 --> 29:26.852
Probably just hiding
and want us to...

29:26.982 --> 29:29.158
Right, well... Lucy,
we're not playing right now!...find them.

29:29.332 --> 29:33.946
Spencer?Hey, guys? Hey. Breakfast.

29:38.341 --> 29:39.473
Lucy?

29:42.824 --> 29:44.521
They're not in any
of the closets.

29:44.608 --> 29:45.958
Okay, wait.

29:46.088 --> 29:47.829
Look, hey, they probably
just went back over

29:47.960 --> 29:49.744
to Thomas and Ellie's place.She just texted me.

29:49.831 --> 29:51.398
There's no way
they're over there.

29:55.184 --> 29:56.707
The kids' shoes are gone.What?

29:57.883 --> 30:00.363
They took their shoes.No, they wouldn't have.

30:01.364 --> 30:04.803
They wouldn't have what, Ben?
Ben, where you gonna go?

30:05.891 --> 30:07.196
They wouldn't have what?

30:08.067 --> 30:10.156
I'm just gonna check the path.
They can't have gone far.

30:10.243 --> 30:12.071
Okay, well, I'll go with you.

30:12.158 --> 30:14.725
No, no, no, stay at the house
in case they come back.

30:15.117 --> 30:17.424
Were they even in the cabin
when we came back in last night?

30:17.554 --> 30:18.947
They didn't sneak out,
all right?

30:19.034 --> 30:20.775
The sun came up, they thought
they'd go for a walk.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.342
They probably just went
back down this path.

30:22.429 --> 30:24.474
They can't have gone far.

30:25.693 --> 30:28.348
They're fine.
Everything's gonna be fine.

30:29.218 --> 30:30.829
We're gonna find them.

30:51.545 --> 30:53.547
Lucy.

30:56.855 --> 31:00.293
Lucy!
Spencer!

31:13.741 --> 31:15.003
Guys?

31:16.178 --> 31:19.703
Jesus Christ, there you are.
What are you guys doing in here?

31:20.400 --> 31:23.882
Hey! You know you can't
be here without an adult.

31:25.971 --> 31:26.972
Guys.

31:30.149 --> 31:31.498
Es brilliante.

31:33.021 --> 31:34.893
Okay, I need you
to come down here right now.

31:38.026 --> 31:39.898
No, I'm... I'm serious.
Right now.

31:41.682 --> 31:43.640
No, no, no. Stop! No!

31:46.730 --> 31:48.384
Oh, God.

32:24.725 --> 32:26.292
Why aren't you answering
your phone?

32:35.518 --> 32:37.042
Fuck.

32:49.924 --> 32:51.665
Margaret.MARGARET: Where are you?

32:51.795 --> 32:53.884
Have you found them?
Please tell me you found them.

32:55.234 --> 32:58.237
I went up to the lookout, and...

32:58.367 --> 33:00.065
Ben? I followed the flowers.

33:00.239 --> 33:01.588
No, Ben, you're breaking up. I followed...

33:01.762 --> 33:03.938
I followed the flowers.Ben?

33:04.634 --> 33:06.158
I'm alm... I'm almost home.

33:11.772 --> 33:12.729
Hey.

33:14.470 --> 33:15.471
Hey.

33:17.082 --> 33:18.822
Thank God.

33:19.432 --> 33:22.304
Thank God. No, Ben,
they're here. They're here.

33:22.391 --> 33:23.610
I was so sure I was gonna see

33:23.697 --> 33:24.828
their little bodies
floating in the lake.

33:24.915 --> 33:27.527
Could you even imagine?

33:27.962 --> 33:29.442
I... I see you.

33:30.834 --> 33:34.664
No, I can't. I can't imagine.

34:03.519 --> 34:05.217
You know
how much he loves to hike...

34:05.304 --> 34:07.045
...so he had to fit one in.

34:07.175 --> 34:09.743
Damn, Ben,
you look like hell.

34:09.873 --> 34:11.310
I was just telling Ellie

34:11.397 --> 34:13.442
how quickly the kids
petered out this morning.

34:13.573 --> 34:15.575
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:15.705 --> 34:17.838
And how you took them out
for a hike, brought them back

34:18.230 --> 34:19.492
and then went out on your own.

34:20.493 --> 34:21.363
Right.

34:26.934 --> 34:28.153
You good, man?

34:28.327 --> 34:31.721
Uh, yeah.
Th... They're... they're okay?

34:32.113 --> 34:34.855
Yeah, except they're bouncing
off the freaking walls.

34:34.985 --> 34:37.727
What'd you guys give them
for breakfast, pure sugar?

34:37.858 --> 34:39.903
Wait for me.ELLIE: No...

34:40.034 --> 34:42.210
I'm busy. I'm... Stop. No.

34:42.776 --> 34:43.951
Okay.

34:44.473 --> 34:45.996
I'm coming to get you!

34:46.127 --> 34:49.130
Well, it looks like
you two enjoyed your night off.

34:59.749 --> 35:02.317
Okay.
We're still standing here.

35:02.448 --> 35:04.972
Mom, why is Ben staring at me?

35:21.641 --> 35:22.946
I saw them.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.518
I know I saw them.

35:59.853 --> 36:01.071
Hey, guys.

36:03.987 --> 36:07.382
Did, uh...
you sleep all right last night?

36:08.035 --> 36:10.951
Of course we did, silly.Dead bugs.

36:12.300 --> 36:13.649
Those aren't dead.

36:19.220 --> 36:20.439
Like I said.

36:26.836 --> 36:30.318
Uh... L...
let me ask you something.

36:30.449 --> 36:33.408
Did you two go for a little walk
this morning?

36:41.547 --> 36:43.070
What was that all about?

36:43.723 --> 36:45.203
It's our secret language.

36:45.986 --> 36:47.466
You want to know
what he said to me?

36:47.596 --> 36:48.771
Stop messing around.
I need to know

36:48.858 --> 36:49.990
where you went this morning.

36:53.602 --> 36:54.908
Hold this under your chin.

36:55.038 --> 36:56.692
If your chin glows yellow...Okay, did you go back

36:56.823 --> 36:57.780
to the fort, all right?

36:58.041 --> 36:59.739
If you did, it's okay.
I just need to know.

36:59.869 --> 37:03.221
Do the thing first,
then I'll tell you. Promise.

37:07.703 --> 37:09.139
Está brillando.

37:09.923 --> 37:11.707
Means you have a secret, too.

37:11.838 --> 37:13.056
Okay, well?

37:13.666 --> 37:15.102
Yes, we went there.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.626
But you won't tell on us,
will you?

37:18.061 --> 37:20.063
Wait, what did you do there?

37:20.194 --> 37:21.413
Careful, Ben.

37:22.414 --> 37:25.068
Or we'll run off
and join the circus.

37:29.812 --> 37:31.858
Hey. Little man.

37:33.163 --> 37:34.730
Careful with those, all right?
They're heavy.

37:34.817 --> 37:36.515
If you hit yourself in the head,
it'll hurt.

37:37.907 --> 37:39.518
Hey, just don't go so high.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.390
Stop.

37:54.402 --> 37:55.882
Is it glowing?

38:09.069 --> 38:10.940
I'm starving.THOMAS: Mm-hmm.

38:11.071 --> 38:12.812
Yeah, you think
that I'd leave this?

38:12.942 --> 38:14.422
No.ELLIE: That's not how it works.

38:14.553 --> 38:16.163
But this is why, like,
I live in a house.

38:19.427 --> 38:22.648
Oh. I'm full.

38:38.403 --> 38:39.491
You all right?

38:40.666 --> 38:43.843
Ben? Ben.

38:46.585 --> 38:49.979
Um... what...
what were they doing?

38:50.850 --> 38:52.373
The kids when you found them.

38:52.852 --> 38:54.070
Oh, I didn't.

38:54.897 --> 38:56.812
Ellie said that they came
into the cabin

38:56.899 --> 38:58.074
right before they saw us.

38:58.423 --> 39:01.077
She thought we sent them over
to get them up in the morning.

39:01.208 --> 39:02.122
They must have been

39:02.252 --> 39:03.776
in the backwoods
behind the cabin

39:03.906 --> 39:05.168
or something
and we just missed them.

39:05.255 --> 39:06.996
They... they went...
they went back there.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.912
Where?T... To that old fort, the pit.

39:11.044 --> 39:13.176
"The place that shines."
They told me that.

39:13.307 --> 39:15.788
That's a really strenuous hike
for two little kids to make.

39:15.918 --> 39:17.224
They're probably
just putting you on.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.879
Wait, you haven't noticed?What?

39:20.270 --> 39:22.272
The way they look at you now?
The... the... the nosebleeds?

39:22.403 --> 39:23.883
And... and Spencer
with the sticks.

39:23.970 --> 39:25.363
He couldn't fucking keep
those things in the air

39:25.450 --> 39:26.451
for two seconds yesterday,

39:26.538 --> 39:27.887
and now he's a goddamn
majorette.

39:27.974 --> 39:29.279
That's not possible.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.543
I was really scared
this morning, too,

39:31.630 --> 39:34.023
but they're here now
and they're safe and it's fine.

39:34.154 --> 39:36.983
No. I... I need you
to just listen to me

39:37.070 --> 39:39.115
'cause what I'm gonna tell you
is gonna sound impossible.

39:39.420 --> 39:41.857
Just please hear me.

39:44.425 --> 39:47.776
I saw them jump into that pit.

39:48.124 --> 39:53.391
I saw them just tip
right into it like they were in

39:53.521 --> 39:55.915
some sort of a trance.

39:56.045 --> 39:59.005
I don't think that's them
out there anymore.

40:11.191 --> 40:12.410
Margo.

40:15.369 --> 40:16.370
What?

40:17.676 --> 40:19.242
How you been feeling lately?

40:19.939 --> 40:21.767
Are you serious right now?

40:22.724 --> 40:24.030
I'm just asking.

40:25.335 --> 40:27.207
Look, you've seen that.

40:27.294 --> 40:29.339
That is not this.
This is not that.

40:29.470 --> 40:31.994
I don't know what this is.Yeah, but you don't believe me.

40:32.125 --> 40:35.433
I think you were
in an agitated state,

40:35.563 --> 40:40.307
and you maybe saw something
that you can't quite explain

40:40.394 --> 40:44.442
or process
in some rational way just yet.

40:45.486 --> 40:48.881
"Rationally." Yeah, no.
Uh, way to parse words, Margo.

40:50.448 --> 40:55.975
Look, we're both really...
a little overtired right now.

40:56.802 --> 40:58.368
You know,
why don't you lie down?

40:59.239 --> 41:00.458
Have a nap.

41:00.675 --> 41:03.461
Yeah. No, you're right.

41:03.548 --> 41:05.332
I should probably
just get some rest.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.681
Okay.

41:35.405 --> 41:37.103
Jesus Christ.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.757
You shouldn't swear.

41:39.018 --> 41:41.586
What are you doing in here?

41:42.282 --> 41:44.110
Just wanted to see
what you were up to.

41:44.240 --> 41:47.200
Okay, well, I'm not in the mood,
so just get out.

41:47.461 --> 41:49.507
But we want to play
a game with you.

41:51.160 --> 41:52.292
What game?

42:29.416 --> 42:31.157
Did you ever play,
like, powder-puff?

42:31.287 --> 42:32.680
Why'd they call it
"Powder-puff?"

42:32.854 --> 42:34.247
I don't know.
'Cause they have to call it,

42:34.508 --> 42:36.162
like, a little bitchy name
'cause you're a girl.

42:36.466 --> 42:38.468
I don't know.That's what I was thinking.
Like, why isn't it just

42:38.556 --> 42:41.210
"Girls football?"It's called "girlie girl
girl football."

42:41.297 --> 42:43.473
"Do you play football
or do you play powder-puff?"

42:45.475 --> 42:46.389
I don't even remember

42:46.738 --> 42:47.956
what was on the back
of my jersey, like...

42:48.217 --> 42:49.915
Hey.

42:50.872 --> 42:52.570
I thought
you were gonna lie down.

42:54.180 --> 42:56.051
Uh, I didn't want to miss
all the fun.

43:01.622 --> 43:03.581
So, I think
that would be good.

43:04.016 --> 43:06.453
Hey. They ever, uh...

43:09.238 --> 43:11.501
They ever scare you?Those two?

43:11.676 --> 43:13.808
Yeah. Absolutely. All the time.

43:13.939 --> 43:18.073
No, not them.
Kids. Your... your kids.

43:18.900 --> 43:20.119
What, you mean like...

43:20.249 --> 43:22.121
I don't know, just, like--
Oh, geez!

43:22.251 --> 43:23.731
Okay.

43:24.776 --> 43:26.995
Good timing, Spence.

43:27.213 --> 43:29.041
I'm hungry.THOMAS: All right, just...

43:29.171 --> 43:30.956
Just have some chips,
but don't overdo it.

43:31.217 --> 43:32.261
Dinner's almost ready.

43:32.740 --> 43:33.915
Hey, Ben!

43:36.352 --> 43:38.050
Just like a super, like, tiny...

43:38.180 --> 43:39.181
Look at me.

43:40.792 --> 43:41.836
Whoa, hey! Hey!

43:44.578 --> 43:45.753
What?

43:47.320 --> 43:48.626
Um...

43:52.064 --> 43:53.326
Do you want a beer?

43:54.457 --> 43:56.329
Uh, no, we're drinking wine.

43:59.724 --> 44:00.855
Cool.

44:03.466 --> 44:04.685
You want some?
They're my favorite.

44:05.381 --> 44:09.690
Jesus Christ. No.But aren't you hungry, Ben?

44:15.740 --> 44:18.003
Hey. Not everybody wants
to spoil their dinner, bud.

44:19.613 --> 44:20.832
You feeling all right?

44:21.571 --> 44:23.051
Yeah, no. I'm...

44:23.573 --> 44:24.792
...just tired.

44:26.011 --> 44:28.361
Excuse me, young lady.
What do you think you're doing?

44:29.667 --> 44:30.580
Oh, my God.

44:30.798 --> 44:34.323
What... Lucy.
That was inappropriate.

44:35.324 --> 44:36.717
And amazing.

44:36.848 --> 44:38.153
Thank you.

44:43.463 --> 44:45.987
That's a really good pour.
Too good.

44:57.695 --> 44:58.608
For you, Daddy.

44:58.957 --> 45:00.741
No, no, no.Oh, my God.
What the hell, dude?

45:01.002 --> 45:02.787
Whoa.THOMAS: The hell's your problem?

45:02.917 --> 45:04.658
Uh, hey, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

45:04.745 --> 45:06.878
Just show, um, show them.

45:07.705 --> 45:10.142
Show them!Hey, don't yell at my son.

45:10.272 --> 45:12.100
Ben, what are you doing?

45:12.231 --> 45:15.016
Give me the bottle.
Give me the goddamn...

45:15.147 --> 45:16.322
Hey, Ben!Hey!

45:16.409 --> 45:17.715
Hands off him!BEN: Give me the goddamn bottle.

45:17.845 --> 45:19.629
Ow!All right, hey, look.

45:19.760 --> 45:21.153
Hey, Ben!What?

45:21.675 --> 45:23.242
You're on mood stabilizers.
So what?

45:24.504 --> 45:26.245
Wait, th... these...
these were empty.

45:26.985 --> 45:30.466
He-- You showed me--
She was gonna put the, um...

45:30.640 --> 45:32.425
them into...SPENCER: My hand.

45:32.512 --> 45:35.080
He hurt my hand.Jesus Christ, Ben.

45:35.167 --> 45:36.603
What's wrong with you?
Are you okay?

45:36.734 --> 45:38.170
I thought they were candy.

45:38.300 --> 45:39.475
No, they're fucking with me.

45:39.606 --> 45:41.608
Ben, he's nine.No. Wh... Whatever he is,

45:41.695 --> 45:42.652
he's fucking with me.

45:43.131 --> 45:44.698
He showed me this bottle.
It was empty, all right?

45:44.829 --> 45:46.613
And she was gonna put
them in... into your drink,

45:46.744 --> 45:49.181
and somehow he got the pills...
you got the pills back in here.

45:49.311 --> 45:51.400
Somehow he put them back in here
to make me look like--

45:51.487 --> 45:53.794
To what? To make me overdose?
Is that what you're saying,

45:53.881 --> 45:55.230
that my kids were gonna
make me overdose?

45:55.404 --> 45:56.797
I... I don't,
I don't, I don't...

45:56.928 --> 45:59.626
Just breathe. Okay?
Take a breath.

46:10.419 --> 46:11.899
They went out on their own
this morning.

46:12.030 --> 46:12.987
Ben.What?

46:13.074 --> 46:14.075
Yeah,
they... they went out.

46:14.380 --> 46:15.860
What are you talking about?BEN: No, no, they...

46:15.947 --> 46:17.470
they snuck out,
and... and I went after them

46:17.557 --> 46:19.602
to the... to the ruins.
And you know what I saw?

46:19.733 --> 46:20.778
No.Yes.

46:21.039 --> 46:22.823
I saw them jump into the pit.
And then I saw

46:22.910 --> 46:25.521
your broken little bodies at
the bottom of that fucking pit!

46:25.870 --> 46:27.262
Ben, shut the fuck up!That's what--

46:27.480 --> 46:29.264
Shut up. Shut up.

46:32.833 --> 46:34.182
Okay. Uh...

46:35.314 --> 46:36.881
Kids, go... go play.

46:37.055 --> 46:39.927
But I want to listen.THOMAS: Lucy.

46:40.101 --> 46:41.320
Vamos.

46:44.845 --> 46:46.542
You let them go out alone?

46:46.673 --> 46:49.850
No. We didn't let them go out.
They just went.

46:49.981 --> 46:52.331
They just-- What do you mean
they just went?

46:52.505 --> 46:54.420
Well, when we woke up,
they were gone.

46:54.507 --> 46:56.509
Hold... hold on a s--
I'm... I'm missing something.

46:56.639 --> 46:58.859
When I texted you this morning,
why didn't you mention that?

46:58.990 --> 47:00.252
Well, I didn't know then,

47:00.382 --> 47:03.559
and we just didn't
tell you afterward.

47:03.690 --> 47:04.778
We just didn't want to worry you

47:04.865 --> 47:06.171
if there was nothing
to worry about.

47:06.388 --> 47:08.347
Margaret, what the fuck?I'm still trying to understand

47:08.477 --> 47:10.218
how you let them
out of your sight like that.

47:10.305 --> 47:11.567
They were sleeping.
What, are we supposed

47:11.698 --> 47:13.352
to tie them in a tree
to protect them from bears?

47:13.482 --> 47:15.136
No, Ben, we wanted you
to be responsible adults,

47:15.223 --> 47:16.921
but clearly we made
a bad judgment call

47:17.008 --> 47:18.313
on you and your goddamn
mental health.

47:18.444 --> 47:20.794
Okay, Thomas, that's enough.

47:20.925 --> 47:23.014
Those are our children,
Margaret.

47:23.101 --> 47:24.537
Okay, maybe you don't know
what that feels like,

47:24.624 --> 47:27.018
but it would be really
fucking nice if you'd try.

47:27.888 --> 47:30.021
Okay, so because
I haven't experienced

47:30.151 --> 47:31.979
the miracle of childbirth,

47:32.240 --> 47:34.590
I don't know what it takes
to babysit your kids?

47:34.721 --> 47:37.202
You don't understand
the responsibility.

47:38.290 --> 47:40.292
What? You say that you guys
aren't kid people

47:40.379 --> 47:42.642
because your jet-setting life
is so full,

47:42.772 --> 47:45.079
you're so focused
on your career.

47:45.514 --> 47:47.777
Give me a fucking break, okay?
You're not fooling anyone.

47:47.908 --> 47:48.996
Are you serious?

47:49.257 --> 47:51.085
Like you two are the paragons
of responsibility?

47:51.216 --> 47:52.652
Okay, you need to stop
right now.

47:52.739 --> 47:54.654
Oh, oh,
Mr. Moral Authority speaks.

47:54.784 --> 47:57.135
I'm not fucking around, Ben.BEN: Oh, great.

47:57.265 --> 47:58.788
I'm glad you're serious.
Then we can all talk

47:58.876 --> 48:00.878
about the fact that we're only
in this situation

48:00.965 --> 48:03.271
because the two of you
pawned your creepy-ass kids

48:03.358 --> 48:04.533
off on the two of us...What?

48:04.664 --> 48:05.883
...to save
your shitty-ass marriage.

48:06.013 --> 48:07.841
Okay, Ben.Oh, wait, right.

48:07.972 --> 48:10.365
You guys live, like, a mile
away from your parents, right?

48:10.496 --> 48:12.063
That's super convenient.
So then you can just

48:12.193 --> 48:13.934
pawn your creepy kids off
on them, too,

48:14.065 --> 48:15.762
whenever you guys
want to go have a foursome.

48:15.893 --> 48:17.938
Ben.

48:18.069 --> 48:19.897
Yeah, I'm sorry. I know.
It was more of a...

48:20.810 --> 48:22.290
two-and-a-half-some, right?MARGARET: Ben!

48:24.423 --> 48:25.903
Are you fucking kidding me?ELLIE: No.

48:26.251 --> 48:27.513
I...THOMAS: You...

48:27.948 --> 48:30.603
Babe, I'm sorry.This is fucked.

48:31.734 --> 48:32.997
I'm sorry.You're all fucked.

48:33.562 --> 48:35.086
You're all fucked!Mm.

48:37.827 --> 48:40.178
Ellie, I'm sorry.

48:43.224 --> 48:45.357
Well, I see everything's
all out on the table.

48:48.534 --> 48:49.622
What?

48:51.493 --> 48:52.668
Come on, Ben.

48:52.842 --> 48:54.801
You think we don't
tell each other everything?

48:55.149 --> 48:57.064
About your little
manic episodes?

48:57.151 --> 48:58.500
Ellie, shut up.

48:59.545 --> 49:01.460
How you went off the deep end
and lost another job?

49:01.939 --> 49:03.679
Ellie.ELLIE: You know,
maybe it's not that

49:03.984 --> 49:05.725
Margaret doesn't want
to have kids.

49:06.204 --> 49:08.771
Maybe she just doesn't want
to have them with you.

49:16.127 --> 49:17.215
Fucking nice.

49:26.398 --> 49:27.442
Ben.

49:51.814 --> 49:52.728
What's wrong?

49:52.859 --> 49:55.514
Stop doing that.

49:55.644 --> 49:57.342
I didn't mean to scare you.

49:58.778 --> 49:59.909
Fuck.

50:01.824 --> 50:03.870
Shit, fuck, shit, fuck.

50:04.044 --> 50:05.828
S... Stop. Okay?
Get out of here.

50:06.438 --> 50:08.222
Guys, look.
Hey, I'm... I'm done.

50:08.527 --> 50:09.789
All right,
go play with your parents.

50:09.919 --> 50:11.225
I don't care anymore.

50:11.704 --> 50:13.836
But don't you want to know
what happened this morning?

50:14.446 --> 50:15.664
I'll tell you.

50:16.274 --> 50:17.884
If you can keep it a secret.

50:19.929 --> 50:22.454
Yeah. No, no, no, I won't
tell anyone. What happened?

50:23.237 --> 50:24.760
Insectos muertos.

50:25.370 --> 50:26.501
What did he just say?

50:26.719 --> 50:28.025
Dead bugs.

50:29.113 --> 50:31.941
Hey, Lucy,
I was responsible

50:32.029 --> 50:33.291
for the two of you,

50:33.552 --> 50:35.858
so I need to know
that you're both okay.

50:38.557 --> 50:40.298
I need to know that I'm okay.

50:40.472 --> 50:42.778
Do you understand that?Of course I do.

50:44.650 --> 50:49.307
And I promise...
we're better than ever.

50:50.917 --> 50:54.138
Jesus Christ.

50:54.225 --> 50:55.443
"Jesus Christ."

50:56.227 --> 50:57.402
All right, give me the shovel.

50:57.532 --> 50:58.707
Make me.

50:58.838 --> 51:00.448
Make you? Just give it to me.

51:01.493 --> 51:04.757
Come on, give it to me.

51:04.887 --> 51:05.975
Spencer!

51:10.806 --> 51:11.807
Spencer?

51:13.592 --> 51:16.551
Hey. Wh-- Spence, hey, hey.

51:16.638 --> 51:18.031
All right, just cough.
Try and cough it up.

51:23.384 --> 51:27.127
Spence. Spencer.
Spence, hey, hey, hey.

51:27.258 --> 51:29.129
Come on. Breathe.
You got to breathe, buddy.

51:29.216 --> 51:30.391
Come on. Come on.

51:33.960 --> 51:36.093
Come on! Come on!

51:36.223 --> 51:38.747
Come on, Spencer.

51:41.359 --> 51:43.883
Spencer, come on.
Just breathe. Breathe.

51:44.013 --> 51:47.147
Please. Come on. Wake up.
Come on, don't... don't do this.

51:47.234 --> 51:48.583
Don't do this.
You're messing with me.

51:48.714 --> 51:50.368
Come on. Come on! Wake up.Ben?

51:50.542 --> 51:51.630
Oh, my God.BEN: He's not breathing.

51:52.021 --> 51:54.023
I... I can't find a pulse.
Margo, I can't find a pulse!

51:54.111 --> 51:56.113
Ellie! Ellie! Move, move, move.What do we do?

51:56.200 --> 51:57.679
What do we do?I don't know.

51:57.853 --> 51:59.899
I don't know.

52:00.029 --> 52:01.857
He's not... he's not, um...Ellie!

52:01.944 --> 52:03.555
I don't know
what we're supposed to do.

52:03.642 --> 52:04.817
What... what?BEN: He's...

52:04.947 --> 52:09.169
What? No, no, no, no!
No, Spencer.

52:09.909 --> 52:11.171
Is he going to be okay?

52:11.302 --> 52:12.868
Come on. No, Spencer.

52:12.999 --> 52:16.133
Come on. Come on, Spencer.MARGARET: Thomas!

52:16.481 --> 52:18.047
Thomas!Come on, Spencer.

52:18.178 --> 52:19.962
What happened?ELLIE: Come on. No.

52:20.093 --> 52:21.616
No. Come on.Daddy.

52:21.747 --> 52:23.183
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

52:23.314 --> 52:25.968
No. No. No. No.THOMAS: Lucy, look at me.

52:26.099 --> 52:28.101
It's gonna be fine.
It's okay.

52:48.513 --> 52:50.602
No. No.

52:59.263 --> 53:00.699
What happened?

53:06.487 --> 53:07.749
What did you do?

53:12.145 --> 53:14.278
No, no, no. I... I didn't,
I didn't do anything.

53:14.365 --> 53:15.627
This wasn't me.
This... this isn't...

53:15.714 --> 53:16.715
this isn't my fault.

53:17.019 --> 53:18.020
What are you talking about?BEN: They did this.

53:18.151 --> 53:19.152
This is... this is their fault!

53:19.239 --> 53:20.371
This is your fault!ELLIE: Get out!

53:20.545 --> 53:21.937
No, I... I...ELLIE: Get out!

53:22.068 --> 53:23.461
Shut up and get the fuck
out of here!

53:23.591 --> 53:24.462
I told you,
ever since they went out...

53:24.897 --> 53:26.290
I just need you to listen.No, get the fuck out!

53:26.377 --> 53:27.552
Okay, okay.Get the fuck out of here!

53:27.639 --> 53:28.553
Get out!

53:28.683 --> 53:29.945
Just listen to me
for one second.

53:30.076 --> 53:31.730
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!

54:00.846 --> 54:02.891
Oh, my God, no!

54:16.296 --> 54:19.517
I need to report a...
Oh, God.

54:20.605 --> 54:22.084
I need to report...

54:25.000 --> 54:27.307
I... I need to report a death.

54:29.222 --> 54:32.269
Hello? This is Thomas Huerta.

54:33.357 --> 54:36.447
Ben Winslow has just
murdered my son.

54:40.233 --> 54:44.106
End of Churchill Road.
The Far Syde Cabins.

54:46.500 --> 54:47.719
A few hours?

54:47.806 --> 54:50.025
Yeah, we can wait.
We'll be here.

56:06.841 --> 56:08.321
Margo.

56:08.452 --> 56:12.107
Hey. No, no. It's not me.
Hey. Hey. Hey.

56:12.194 --> 56:13.718
You got to believe me.

56:14.240 --> 56:15.981
I don't know what to say to you.

56:16.111 --> 56:18.897
This all started when we...
when we went to the ruins.

56:19.332 --> 56:20.594
Th... Think about it.

56:20.681 --> 56:23.336
The kids have been obsessed
with going back there.

56:23.467 --> 56:25.251
"The place that shines."

56:25.382 --> 56:27.862
They jumped in, and something
down there took their place.

56:27.993 --> 56:29.951
Their bodies
must still be there.

56:30.082 --> 56:33.041
Oh, Ben.No, no, I'm not crazy. I'm not.

56:33.607 --> 56:35.261
You know, if you come with me,
you'll see.

56:35.392 --> 56:36.915
Come on, come on.Ben, let go of me.

56:37.002 --> 56:38.656
No, you just need to see.Let go of my arm.

56:38.786 --> 56:39.918
No, come on.Ben!

56:40.179 --> 56:42.442
You're just making things worse.
What will this prove?

56:42.573 --> 56:45.184
I need you to believe me.
I need you to be on my side.

56:46.577 --> 56:48.448
Fine. Fine, let's go.

56:48.535 --> 56:51.625
And when there's nothing there,
what then? What do we do then?

58:22.542 --> 58:23.848
They were there.

58:26.415 --> 58:29.549
Margaret,
they were just right there.

58:31.856 --> 58:33.466
Margaret, please.

58:36.121 --> 58:37.514
Do not look at me like that.

58:40.342 --> 58:41.953
There's nothing there, Ben.

58:42.083 --> 58:43.258
No, I know what I saw.

58:43.345 --> 58:45.478
They were right there, okay?

58:45.609 --> 58:48.002
Just right...
just right fucking there!

58:48.133 --> 58:49.961
All right, all right, okay.

58:50.091 --> 58:52.311
I'll j... I'll...
I can climb down and I...

58:54.661 --> 58:58.012
What the fuck? Okay. Okay, okay.

58:58.099 --> 58:59.840
I bet an animal
dragged them away or something.

58:59.927 --> 59:01.363
Some... Something happened!
Some...

59:01.450 --> 59:02.756
Th... There's something
I just don't understand yet...

59:02.843 --> 59:04.149
Ben. Ben....but I will.

59:04.279 --> 59:05.585
Okay, no, no, no!
I'm gonna understand,

59:05.672 --> 59:08.022
and then you'll see it.Ben! Just stop!

59:09.067 --> 59:14.115
Even with all of the evidence
just staring right at you,

59:14.202 --> 59:18.511
you can't admit, you can't even
acknowledge just for one moment

59:18.598 --> 59:20.469
that you might be wrong!

59:21.558 --> 59:24.517
Everything that's happening...
it's just in your head!

59:28.521 --> 59:30.871
I know what I saw.

59:31.306 --> 59:34.092
You need to listen to me.

59:34.701 --> 59:38.313
Ben, Spencer is dead.

59:39.184 --> 59:42.187
He is dead.
And it's not because of

59:42.622 --> 59:45.756
some old building
or a hole in the ground.

59:45.886 --> 59:48.889
It's because your actions,
they have consequences.

59:49.020 --> 59:53.459
Your ac... You. You did this.
Just you.

59:56.593 --> 59:57.942
That's how it is?

59:59.987 --> 1:00:01.815
Yeah, that's how it is.

1:00:11.912 --> 1:00:13.392
Ben.

1:00:21.182 --> 1:00:26.535
We have to go back and...
sort it out.

1:00:28.712 --> 1:00:31.497
But... when we're there...

1:00:33.499 --> 1:00:35.501
we can keep talking.

1:00:36.676 --> 1:00:39.636
Ben, for me, please.
Let's just go back together.

1:02:08.550 --> 1:02:09.421
Oh.

1:02:17.821 --> 1:02:19.561
You should be with your parents.

1:02:20.171 --> 1:02:23.174
It's okay. He's just playing.

1:02:25.742 --> 1:02:28.788
Lucy, honey...Can I show you a trick?

1:02:31.399 --> 1:02:32.531
Sure.

1:02:36.404 --> 1:02:40.626
Oh. Lucy, I think we should stay
by the cabin with your parents.

1:02:42.846 --> 1:02:44.412
I'll get them soon.

1:02:45.065 --> 1:02:46.110
What?

1:02:47.285 --> 1:02:48.939
I want to play with you now.

1:02:52.377 --> 1:02:53.421
Honey...

1:02:53.552 --> 1:02:55.423
I want to show you
what's in the woods.

1:02:59.471 --> 1:03:00.515
Lucy.

1:03:03.649 --> 1:03:06.347
I want to show you
what's in the woods.

1:03:10.874 --> 1:03:14.094
Please?

1:03:14.225 --> 1:03:16.314
Oh, honey.

1:03:20.927 --> 1:03:22.494
Are you okay
for a minute?

1:03:22.842 --> 1:03:24.801
I'll... I'll be just a minute,
okay, hon?

1:03:25.410 --> 1:03:26.541
I'll be right back.

1:03:53.003 --> 1:03:54.352
Hey.

1:03:55.092 --> 1:03:56.658
Get the hell away from her,
Margaret.

1:03:56.789 --> 1:03:58.138
Lucy, come here right now.

1:03:58.269 --> 1:03:59.792
But...She just wanted to...

1:03:59.879 --> 1:04:01.707
Don't tell me what she wants.

1:04:04.492 --> 1:04:05.798
I'm gonna go check
on your mother.

1:04:05.929 --> 1:04:07.321
You stay strong, okay?

1:04:15.895 --> 1:04:16.896
Daddy?

1:04:18.724 --> 1:04:19.856
Are you okay?

1:04:21.727 --> 1:04:23.424
Can I show you something
in the woods?

1:04:56.675 --> 1:04:57.806
Ellie?

1:05:07.033 --> 1:05:08.165
Ellie?

1:05:21.352 --> 1:05:22.744
Ellie?

1:05:38.282 --> 1:05:39.370
Ellie?

1:05:45.942 --> 1:05:47.160
Ellie?

1:05:50.163 --> 1:05:51.469
Thomas?

1:06:06.745 --> 1:06:08.138
Thomas?

1:06:19.932 --> 1:06:21.455
Thomas?

1:06:25.198 --> 1:06:26.373
Thomas?

1:06:29.507 --> 1:06:30.856
Hello?

1:07:07.501 --> 1:07:09.329
Fuck.

1:07:09.764 --> 1:07:13.942
Oh, come on, Ben.
Pick up, Ben.

1:08:24.317 --> 1:08:25.449
Ellie?

1:08:33.587 --> 1:08:34.588
What the fuck?

1:08:50.517 --> 1:08:53.564
Oh, m... Oh, my God!

1:08:53.651 --> 1:08:56.175
Ellie! Ellie!

1:08:56.306 --> 1:08:59.918
Ellie! Ellie, what...

1:09:00.136 --> 1:09:03.139
Oh, my God, what happened?

1:09:03.269 --> 1:09:06.359
What happened?

1:09:13.279 --> 1:09:14.759
Oh, my God.

1:09:32.342 --> 1:09:34.344
Spencer?

1:09:48.096 --> 1:09:50.055
What did you do to your mom,
Spencer?

1:11:38.206 --> 1:11:42.776
Want to play a game, Margaret?
It's fun, I promise.

1:11:44.256 --> 1:11:45.910
You play the Rabid Queen.

1:11:46.084 --> 1:11:48.086
And I'll even give you
a head start.

1:11:50.088 --> 1:11:53.831
You want to know what happens
when we catch the Rabid Queen?

1:11:54.440 --> 1:11:56.486
I never got to tell you.

1:12:15.069 --> 1:12:16.462
Ten.

1:12:18.595 --> 1:12:19.813
Nine.

1:12:22.773 --> 1:12:24.775
Eight.

1:12:26.646 --> 1:12:28.735
Seven.

1:12:30.911 --> 1:12:33.044
Six.

1:12:35.176 --> 1:12:36.613
Five.

1:12:39.006 --> 1:12:40.268
Four.

1:12:42.749 --> 1:12:44.011
Three.

1:12:46.536 --> 1:12:48.146
Two.

1:12:51.279 --> 1:12:52.629
One.

1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:59.287
Ready or not,
here we come.

1:13:53.124 --> 1:13:54.255
Off with her head.

1:14:01.393 --> 1:14:03.351
She's dead. They killed her.PARK RANGER: Whoa, whoa.

1:14:03.482 --> 1:14:05.223
Slow down. Slow down.
Are you Ms. Huerta?

1:14:05.310 --> 1:14:07.225
No. She's dead. They killed her.

1:14:07.312 --> 1:14:08.618
You're not listening to me.Okay, I received

1:14:08.705 --> 1:14:09.923
a call about a dead boy.

1:14:10.010 --> 1:14:11.577
It's Ms. Huerta who's dead?

1:14:11.664 --> 1:14:14.319
No, he's not dead.
He came back and he killed her.

1:14:14.406 --> 1:14:16.800
Listen, I need you
to take a deep breath, okay?

1:14:16.887 --> 1:14:17.888
Just breathe.

1:14:18.018 --> 1:14:20.151
It's them.
It's the fucking children.

1:14:20.238 --> 1:14:22.327
We... we need to get
into your truck right now.

1:14:22.414 --> 1:14:24.416
All... all right, ma'am.
Why don't we go inside

1:14:24.503 --> 1:14:26.505
and you can just show me
what happened, okay?

1:14:26.592 --> 1:14:28.159
Everything's gonna be all right.
We'll work this out.

1:14:28.246 --> 1:14:29.769
I don't want to go in there.
She's in there.

1:14:29.856 --> 1:14:32.163
Ms. Huerta?No, it's... it's her kids.

1:14:32.293 --> 1:14:33.991
She's dead in the bedroom.

1:14:34.078 --> 1:14:35.253
Okay, okay.And now her...

1:14:35.427 --> 1:14:38.474
Actually, why don't you stay
out here instead, okay?

1:14:38.561 --> 1:14:40.563
I'll just go in
and check things out,

1:14:40.650 --> 1:14:42.129
see what's what and...

1:14:42.390 --> 1:14:44.784
Stay right there. Do not move.

1:14:46.351 --> 1:14:48.396
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

1:15:07.459 --> 1:15:08.634
Fuck this.

1:15:10.854 --> 1:15:13.552
All right. Stop right there,
ma'am. Stop. Okay?

1:15:13.900 --> 1:15:16.424
There's a lot of blood in there.
You're right about that.

1:15:16.555 --> 1:15:18.165
But there's no dead boy

1:15:18.252 --> 1:15:20.167
and there's no dead lady
in there either.

1:15:21.342 --> 1:15:23.649
That's not possible. I...

1:15:23.780 --> 1:15:26.173
Listen, I'm gonna need you
to come down with me to... to...

1:16:19.313 --> 1:16:24.101
Margaret.
Where are you?

1:16:24.667 --> 1:16:27.670
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1:17:10.408 --> 1:17:13.367
Olly olly oxen free.

1:18:34.535 --> 1:18:35.711
Ben?

1:18:37.321 --> 1:18:38.539
Ben?

1:18:45.285 --> 1:18:46.634
Ben?

1:18:47.810 --> 1:18:49.246
Ben, where are you?

1:18:52.858 --> 1:18:54.251
Margaret.

1:18:54.468 --> 1:18:58.559
Oh, my God.
Okay.

1:18:58.690 --> 1:18:59.735
Okay, we need to go.

1:18:59.865 --> 1:19:00.997
What?We need to go.

1:19:01.084 --> 1:19:02.563
I'm so sorry
that I didn't listen to you,

1:19:02.650 --> 1:19:04.478
but everything you said was true
so we have to go now.

1:19:04.565 --> 1:19:05.741
No, no, no.
Why would we do that?

1:19:05.871 --> 1:19:07.699
Because they're trying
to kill us.

1:19:07.786 --> 1:19:09.353
No, it's beautiful.

1:19:09.962 --> 1:19:11.268
I didn't understand
why the kids were

1:19:11.398 --> 1:19:14.967
so drawn to it before,
but now... now I do.

1:19:15.054 --> 1:19:16.316
I know why
they followed it down.

1:19:16.403 --> 1:19:17.796
Hey, I... I don't know
what you're talking about,

1:19:17.883 --> 1:19:19.667
but we need to, we need to,
we need to go now.

1:19:19.755 --> 1:19:21.408
The place that shines.

1:19:23.454 --> 1:19:25.195
And you can see it, too.

1:19:25.935 --> 1:19:28.807
I don't...
I don't want to see it.

1:19:28.981 --> 1:19:31.767
I want to... I want to go, Ben.

1:19:31.897 --> 1:19:33.464
There's nowhere else to go.

1:19:36.815 --> 1:19:38.774
I think we should settle down.

1:19:46.782 --> 1:19:48.435
We should start a family.

1:19:53.919 --> 1:19:59.185
You decided for us before,
but now... I'm weighing in.

1:19:59.795 --> 1:20:02.319
Those fucking things
are trying to fucking kill us!

1:20:02.928 --> 1:20:04.843
We don't even know
where Thomas is.

1:20:05.626 --> 1:20:08.064
Those things, they killed Ellie.

1:20:08.194 --> 1:20:10.675
They're young. They'll learn.

1:20:11.719 --> 1:20:14.461
And we can be together.
All of us.

1:20:14.722 --> 1:20:17.377
That feeling of connection
you've been searching for.

1:20:17.943 --> 1:20:20.293
It's being part
of something bigger.

1:20:22.078 --> 1:20:25.733
I've found that. I can show you.

1:20:30.608 --> 1:20:32.523
I don't know what you are,
but you're not Ben.

1:20:38.921 --> 1:20:40.226
You'll see.

1:20:41.358 --> 1:20:42.750
And you'll make more of them.

1:20:44.317 --> 1:20:47.973
We'll make more.
We'll make them together.

1:26:49.465 --> 1:26:50.553
Margaret.

1:26:52.424 --> 1:26:54.209
No.

1:26:56.820 --> 1:26:58.082
No.

1:27:04.044 --> 1:27:08.484
Just... just let me go.
Let me go.

1:27:12.923 --> 1:27:14.011
Go!

1:27:15.708 --> 1:27:16.970
Go!

1:27:28.373 --> 1:27:30.245
Margaret!
