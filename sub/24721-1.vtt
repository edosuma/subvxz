00:31.073 --> 00:34.284
I like to think about the
beginning of the universe a lot.

00:34.493 --> 00:36.286
A lot, a lot.

00:36.495 --> 00:40.040
About how there's
ten trillion galaxies,

00:40.249 --> 00:42.751
more stars than grains
of sand on the Earth,

00:42.960 --> 00:47.339
how it's been around for 13.82
billion years, give or take.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.175
So why does this stupid
little moment feel so big?

00:52.678 --> 00:53.679
It's so small.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.431
My first day
at public school.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.642
That's my mom
holding my hand.

00:58.850 --> 01:01.061
Are you sure we should
be holding hands?

01:01.270 --> 01:03.814
- Yeah, yeah, obviously.
- Don't be nervous.

01:04.022 --> 01:06.441
Let's go in. I'm freezing
my tits off out here.

01:06.650 --> 01:07.568
Okay.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.361
Big freaking exam day.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.159
I don't know this yet,

01:16.368 --> 01:19.454
but walking through those doors
is gonna change my life forever,

01:19.663 --> 01:23.208
like some supernova
explosion of love.

01:26.962 --> 01:30.299
Wait. Oh, that's a
really pretty image.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.633
Rewind.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.176
Let's go to
the beginning of me.

02:56.385 --> 02:59.304
Hey, Liam.
Hey. Liam?

02:59.513 --> 03:02.641
Okay, what are your obstacles
for tomorrow's exam? Go.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.644
Uh, sometimes I get lazy with my
handwriting and my Y's look like J's.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.396
- Yes.
- I can do better. I can do better.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.981
Mom, uh...
And I get nervous sweats.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.858
Go to Cambridge,
study with Stephen Hawking,

03:12.067 --> 03:14.361
become the second-most famous
astronomer of all time.

03:14.569 --> 03:15.862
Honey, I think you can
become most famous.

03:16.071 --> 03:17.823
I mean, it's Stephen
Hawking, come on.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.533
Hot hint for today's
practice exam,

03:19.741 --> 03:21.159
it's just a practice.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.537
But tomorrow, not too
much water pre-exam.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.122
- Why not?
- Too many bathroom breaks.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.040
- Right.
- Okay.

03:27.249 --> 03:28.417
Batter up. Ready?

03:28.625 --> 03:29.835
I'm already
a little bit excited.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.420
- Yeah.
- Yeah, look, I'm sweating.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.046
- Really?
- Looks like excite sweat.

03:33.255 --> 03:34.172
- That's fun.
- You wanna feel it?

03:34.381 --> 03:35.173
Yeah.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.883
Ew! Okay.

03:38.135 --> 03:39.845
All right. Ready?

03:40.053 --> 03:42.139
You may begin... now.

03:55.193 --> 03:55.986
Oh, nuts!

03:57.487 --> 03:59.406
- Can I sharpen my pencil?
- Yes.

04:01.783 --> 04:05.036
We should get you
a good mechanical pencil.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.551
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

04:21.470 --> 04:22.596
- Let's celebrate!
- Okay.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.139
Wiggles]
- I am.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.348
What do you mean?

04:25.557 --> 04:26.641
-L'm celebrating.
- When?

04:28.101 --> 04:30.020
- Right now.
- Now?

04:30.228 --> 04:31.521
- Right now.
- You're celebrating right now?

04:31.730 --> 04:33.148
Yep.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.609
Well, we can really celebrate
at prom tomorrow night.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.111
Are you excited?
We can really cut loose.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.071
Yeah, I was thinking of maybe
just doing some silent reading.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.448
Liam!

04:41.656 --> 04:43.074
When you graduate,
you have to have a prom.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.451
It's a rite of passage.

04:44.659 --> 04:45.452
Who did you invite?

04:47.245 --> 04:48.580
YOU?

04:48.789 --> 04:50.791
Well, of course I'm
gonna be there, sweetie.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.834
- My best friend.
- You know what?

04:53.043 --> 04:54.961
I love you infinity.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.296
Go outside
and play, kiddo.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.485
Okay.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.570
Okay, now remember,
always put down an answer

05:20.779 --> 05:22.155
even if you don't know
the answer.

05:22.364 --> 05:23.782
And start with
the easiest questions first,

05:23.990 --> 05:25.408
and then move on
to the hardest questions,

05:25.617 --> 05:27.035
because that way you'll
leave yourself more time

05:27.244 --> 05:27.994
for the things
you don't know

05:28.203 --> 05:29.204
and you won't stress out

05:29.412 --> 05:30.622
about the things
that you do know,

05:30.831 --> 05:31.832
because you'll
be freaking out about

05:32.040 --> 05:34.000
some of the harder questions.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.585
Liam?

05:35.794 --> 05:38.213
Wow, there are
so many students!

05:38.421 --> 05:39.840
Honey, focus.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.925
- Focus, okay?
- Yeah.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.094
Ugh! I had to
go to this school.

05:44.302 --> 05:46.972
I had to go to this school for
stupid people, but you don't.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.099
You're going to Cambridge,
because you are special

05:49.307 --> 05:50.392
and you're perfect, all right?

05:50.600 --> 05:51.393
Remember that.

05:51.601 --> 05:52.894
Now we put you in layers,

05:53.103 --> 05:54.563
because if it gets cold,
you can put 'em back on.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.398
When you get hot,
you can take 'em off.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.984
Okay, and don't, like,
look all, like, up in the sky

05:59.192 --> 06:00.402
back and forth
like Stevie Wonder

06:00.610 --> 06:01.820
if you don't
know the answer,

06:02.028 --> 06:03.446
because they will nail
your butt for cheating.

06:03.655 --> 06:05.031
They will. Okay?

06:05.240 --> 06:07.784
Now, when you
pass this test,

06:07.993 --> 06:08.994
you are
a high school graduate.

06:12.414 --> 06:14.207
Okay, go! Go get 'em!

06:17.544 --> 06:19.087
What? Oh!

06:29.180 --> 06:30.015
Hi, Autumn.

06:31.766 --> 06:32.934
Hi, Liam.

06:34.185 --> 06:35.812
Meet Autumn.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.230
She runs a not-for-profit

06:37.439 --> 06:38.732
that protests
cruelty to snails.

06:48.617 --> 06:50.660
All this training
for you, my dear.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.580
And you can begin...

06:57.751 --> 06:59.044
now.

07:02.297 --> 07:05.425
Only losers
get 97 fricking percent.

07:05.634 --> 07:06.718
I've been here all morning.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.303
Autumn insisted
that we come early.

07:08.511 --> 07:09.596
Gross.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.264
You know, Autumn's
been requesting

07:11.473 --> 07:12.974
we do a unit
on Bolivian weaving.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.352
- Hmm.
- She can't get enough of it. Get this.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.730
She made a traditional
Bolivian flat-knot for me.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.565
I've been using it
as a phone case.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.651
Liam is
obsessed with black holes.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.736
- I love it when you do that.
- Thank you.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.321
Do you want me
to talk dirty?

07:26.529 --> 07:28.198
Yes.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.824
Looks like we're gonna need
a new trophy case, huh?

07:30.033 --> 07:31.284
These aren't trophies.

07:31.493 --> 07:32.911
They're just awards
for participation.

07:34.537 --> 07:38.208
We have a very high
rate of participation.

07:38.416 --> 07:41.586
It's Dumbo. Participation's
mandatory, not award-worthy.

07:41.795 --> 07:45.256
Well, at this school,
it's award-worthy, you know.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.341
I'm the principal.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.968
- Okay.
- That's nice.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.469
Normally that
impresses people.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.137
My name's on this one.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.181
It's a participation award
for the debate club.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.392
Oh, yeah. There you go.
Yeah. Hey, congrats.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.519
Thanks. I got pregnant
on that field trip.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.105
That's quite a bit
of participation.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.940
I have a son.
I home-school him.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.400
Home-school kids.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.193
- Normally that impresses people.
- Yeah.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.863
Well, hey,
next time you're here,

08:09.072 --> 08:10.991
we'll setup an appointment and
we'll talk curriculum. Yeah?

08:11.199 --> 08:12.701
Okay, great. We'll probably
never be here again, though.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.369
- Okay.
- Ugh!

08:14.577 --> 08:16.830
That was the closest
I've been to sex in a while.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.456
Me, too.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.624
You know, the kids here
are getting way more than me,

08:19.833 --> 08:21.334
like circle-jerk
parties at 13!

08:21.543 --> 08:25.797
Yeah. That's why I'm going
with Liam to Cambridge,

08:26.006 --> 08:28.049
to protect him
from getting derailed.

08:28.258 --> 08:29.884
Autumn's not getting
derailed without me.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.679
No one's having sex
with those kids but us.

08:32.886 --> 08:34.097
Around.

08:34.304 --> 08:35.597
- Yes.
- Or nearby at least.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.518
'Etimer b e8 was! ps1

08:38.727 --> 08:39.894
Fifty-three minutes left.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.605
Good Job, Liam.
Pat on the back.

08:52.657 --> 08:53.533
What? All done?

08:53.742 --> 08:55.118
It's impossible.

08:55.326 --> 08:56.911
Apparently it is not.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.663
Uh, you should know that
someone wrote on the desk

08:58.872 --> 09:00.749
with permanent marker,
"You're a dirty cocksucker."

09:00.957 --> 09:02.834
I'm not
a dirty cocksucker.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.294
It wasn't me.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.147
The light from
the Quanta 6 supernova

09:24.355 --> 09:26.399
is probably hitting
Earth right now.

09:28.318 --> 09:31.154
Wow! Crazy!

09:54.302 --> 09:55.678
Can I get my test back?

09:55.887 --> 09:57.263
- Yeah, what's your name?
-lt's Liam Heap.

09:57.472 --> 09:58.431
It's right there.
It's the only one there.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.141
Right.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.185
You're the kid that called me
"the dirty cocksucker."

10:02.393 --> 10:04.437
That wasn't me.
Somebody wrote it on the desk.

10:04.646 --> 10:05.855
You kids start
these nasty rumors

10:06.064 --> 10:08.399
about me and Tony,
the Phys. Ed. teacher,

10:08.608 --> 10:11.027
because you see me and Tony
hanging at lunch, shooting hoops?

10:11.236 --> 10:12.320
Well, all right, yeah.

10:12.529 --> 10:16.449
I had been with a man,
and it was Tony.

10:16.658 --> 10:19.160
But I'm... I'm not
a dirty cocksucker.

10:19.369 --> 10:21.371
Can I just have
my test back, please?

10:22.747 --> 10:24.082
Okay.

10:38.888 --> 10:42.142
You double-aced it, right?
I mean, you did, right?

10:42.350 --> 10:43.852
You did. I can tell.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.980
Ooh! It's written all over
your superb little face.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.566
I almost think
we should get ice cream.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.234
Almost.

10:51.442 --> 10:52.861
You know what else
I was thinking?

10:54.946 --> 10:57.365
I was thinking today...

10:59.117 --> 11:00.994
um, I'm gonna go
to Cambridge with you.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.580
I mean, why not?

11:03.788 --> 11:06.332
You're gonna be there
all by yourself. Right?

11:07.500 --> 11:08.334
Right?

11:10.128 --> 11:12.088
Oh, well, it's locked
and zippered.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.631
Well, let's just...

11:13.840 --> 11:15.717
Oh, wait.
Hold on one second.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.510
I have the key!

11:17.719 --> 11:18.970
So I will...

11:19.179 --> 11:21.514
Oh, wow! It is not
budging the vault.

11:21.723 --> 11:22.599
I see.

11:22.807 --> 11:23.725
It's the wrong key, Mom.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.024
Cambridge. Oh, God!
University life.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.984
Hey, you got any
hotties coming in?

11:33.193 --> 11:34.819
No, I don't have
any girlfriends here.

11:37.071 --> 11:38.239
Hey, what's that?

11:38.448 --> 11:39.991
My friend book.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.203
It's like online,
but not online.

11:43.411 --> 11:46.080
As you can see, the top two
spaces are solidly filled,

11:46.289 --> 11:48.625
but the third
is up for grabs.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.752
If you're interested,
I can put you down.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.421
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
put me down there.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.131
That list should fill up
and go viral.

11:55.340 --> 11:58.009
Okay. I would really
like to cut in.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.010
All right, he's all yours.

11:59.219 --> 11:59.844
- Okay.
- Thanks.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.096
Come here, you.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.933
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

12:06.309 --> 12:07.602
I feel like
a pretty cool kid.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.896
You are such a cool kid.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.731
I hope this is a long song,
'cause Grandma

12:11.940 --> 12:14.234
is chomping at the bit
to dance with you.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.361
You look like
a real man today, Liam.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.538
What?

12:51.854 --> 12:53.147
Good night!

12:55.817 --> 12:56.651
Good night, Mom!

13:19.590 --> 13:21.676
- Go ahead, open it.
- You already did.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.303
Read it.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.346
- Do you know what that means?
- That you opened it?

13:25.555 --> 13:27.765
What else?

13:27.974 --> 13:29.642
That I didn't
graduate high school?

13:29.851 --> 13:32.854
No. You failed!

13:33.062 --> 13:36.399
You failed home-school!
You failed us!

13:36.607 --> 13:38.651
Look, I can take the test
again in four months.

13:38.860 --> 13:42.363
There must be some kind of error.
6% in physics?

13:42.572 --> 13:44.741
Physics, Liam.
You own physics!

13:44.949 --> 13:46.200
Technically,
I don't own physics.

13:46.409 --> 13:47.368
Technically,
physics owns me.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.412
How can you get 6%?

13:49.620 --> 13:51.789
- I caved.
- Caved how?

13:51.998 --> 13:53.458
Under intense
high school pressures.

13:53.666 --> 13:54.709
Bull crap!

13:54.917 --> 13:56.377
You know this stuff.

13:56.586 --> 13:58.379
This is why you've been such
a hush-hush bug. What...

13:58.588 --> 13:59.839
What is it?

14:00.048 --> 14:02.633
- Those questions were hard.
- Bull crap!

14:02.842 --> 14:04.469
And plus, females.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.637
I got all frightened,
and tingly, and--

14:06.846 --> 14:07.638
Whoa.

14:10.641 --> 14:11.768
Hold the telephone.

14:14.854 --> 14:15.855
You're rebelling.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.733
That's what this is.

14:18.941 --> 14:21.444
Oh, my God! I can't...
I can't even look at your face.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.029
You're rebelling so much.
I can't.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.155
- Mom.
- No.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.281
- Mom, look at me.
- No.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.367
- Mom, look at my face.
- No! No!

14:27.575 --> 14:32.413
Look. Mom! I saw some things
that I have never seen before.

14:33.790 --> 14:34.749
I think I need
to fess up here.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.459
Yeah.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.379
I was thinking that maybe
I might make the decision

14:39.587 --> 14:43.049
that it's kinda time for me
to maybe go to public school.

14:46.052 --> 14:49.013
Public school?
Are you trying to kill me?

14:49.222 --> 14:51.474
Liam, I have taught you
more in days

14:51.682 --> 14:53.142
than they could
teach you in years!

14:53.351 --> 14:54.727
Public school?

14:54.936 --> 14:56.687
- Mom, I don't know what to say.
- Baloney!

14:56.896 --> 14:58.231
What 12-year-old boy

14:58.439 --> 15:01.275
teaches blind kids to read
Braille in Cambodia?

15:01.484 --> 15:03.403
You are a man
of the world!

15:04.695 --> 15:06.072
Baby, I don't get it.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.074
Can you just give me...
Give me ten reasons!

15:49.991 --> 15:51.492
I'm sorry.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.457
Now I just wanna
be clear right off the bat.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.460
This is school, right?

16:00.668 --> 16:02.044
We're not just sitting
around the house

16:02.253 --> 16:05.173
learning about pirates
and making volcanoes.

16:05.381 --> 16:08.259
This school is serious.

16:08.468 --> 16:13.306
As in serious gangs
and serious drugs. Yeah.

16:13.514 --> 16:14.807
Sometimes I don't even
wanna walk down the halls.

16:15.016 --> 16:17.560
Some of these guys
are packing heat.

16:17.768 --> 16:20.480
I mean, take for example,
Maria Sanchez. She's...

16:21.856 --> 16:23.065
Yeah, just like you,

16:23.274 --> 16:24.901
straight A's, sweet kid.

16:25.109 --> 16:28.196
But unfortunately,
she just took a leave.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.614
- Because of the drugs?
- No.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.533
She's got a lung thing.
Or no, it's a...

16:32.742 --> 16:34.285
It's a brain thing.
It's one or the other.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.830
It's... I've got it here.
I got it here somewhere.

16:38.039 --> 16:39.790
What's happening?
What's that?

16:39.999 --> 16:42.460
I don't...
Okay, I don't...

16:42.668 --> 16:45.046
You know,
it's a zoo here, okay?

16:45.254 --> 16:47.423
We've got
over 2,000 students.

16:47.632 --> 16:50.760
Right. Well, we tried.
Let's go.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.970
What if I took
the sick girl's spot?

16:53.179 --> 16:54.764
What are you getting at, kid?

16:54.972 --> 16:58.309
Well, if Maria Sanchez is sick,
then I can take her seat,

16:58.518 --> 17:00.311
her classes,
I can do her homework.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.729
I mean,
you have a free space

17:01.938 --> 17:04.690
to experience high school
for one week.

17:04.898 --> 17:06.817
That would save me
a lot of paperwork.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.653
You can't really do that, though.
Can you?

17:08.861 --> 17:10.863
Yeah. No. I mean,
I can do anything

17:11.071 --> 17:13.491
with a memo. Just...

17:13.699 --> 17:17.078
Yeah,
Liam can slide right

17:17.286 --> 17:20.498
into Maria's slot

17:20.705 --> 17:24.126
and take-- take her place
from the...

17:24.335 --> 17:26.587
Um, let's see.

17:26.796 --> 17:29.173
Yeah, go to her classes, sit at
her desk, do her assignments.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.467
This is her class.
That's her class schedule.

17:31.676 --> 17:34.720
And you're gonna need this.
This is her ID.

17:34.929 --> 17:37.640
Modern dance and Phys. Ed.
ls that necessary?

17:37.848 --> 17:42.728
Yeah. Maria Sanchez is
one of our top learners.

17:42.937 --> 17:45.690
This looks like a community
center schedule,

17:45.898 --> 17:50.570
or some kind of assisted
living center schedule.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.743
A little independence.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.036
It's good for you.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.289
This is so hard.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.456
I know.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.960
- Do you have your key?
- Yeah.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.713
- Okay. And your cell?
- Oh, yeah. It's...

18:08.921 --> 18:10.881
Okay.
Right, one last hug.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.883
Okay, final hug. Go.

18:17.888 --> 18:20.057
Okay, hug break.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.059
We're stuck together,
you and me.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.395
- Yeah, forever.
- Forever.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.980
- Well, not forever.
- No, forever.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.481
-Okay.
-Okay.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.026
Okay!

18:45.958 --> 18:46.959
Hey.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.921
- Who're you?
- Hello.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.923
My name's Liam Heap.
I'm here for a week

18:53.132 --> 18:54.884
to win over
the one-legged girl.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.136
And I'm filling in
for Maria Sanchez.

18:57.345 --> 18:58.304
This is her locker?

18:58.512 --> 19:00.890
Yeah, Maria is
my locker buddy,

19:01.098 --> 19:02.808
and you're not
getting the combo.

19:03.017 --> 19:04.560
See, I got
my trophies in there.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.104
Okay, you may
not recognize me,

19:07.313 --> 19:08.814
but I am
the reigning champ

19:09.023 --> 19:10.941
at the Cherry Rock High
Halloween Contest,

19:11.150 --> 19:12.401
four years in a row.

19:12.610 --> 19:13.653
Four years.

19:13.861 --> 19:16.155
I got last year,
the year before that,

19:16.364 --> 19:18.157
the year before that,
and the year before that.

19:18.366 --> 19:19.700
You know
what I'm saying?

19:19.909 --> 19:21.994
That means that
I am the bar.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.120
Yeah.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.875
You like Rigoberto Bianco?

19:28.084 --> 19:30.294
Yeah, is he a wizard or...

19:30.503 --> 19:33.631
No, no. He's like a... He's
like a Spanish Michael Bolton.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.765
Look, I'm here
on a mission.

19:42.973 --> 19:47.019
Right, the one-legged
wonder girl.

19:47.228 --> 19:50.481
I swear, there's a new guy in here
every term chasing after her.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.441
You know, she never told anybody
what happened to her leg.

19:52.650 --> 19:53.734
She saves that.

19:55.111 --> 19:55.778
It's legend.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.031
Anyway, just to be clear...

20:00.866 --> 20:02.451
we're not gonna be friends.

20:02.660 --> 20:03.828
I got enough friends.

20:05.871 --> 20:06.872
Right.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.310
- Corey.
- Here.

20:28.519 --> 20:29.770
- Stephanie.
- Present.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.273
Justine.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.025
Wow! Same class.

20:35.234 --> 20:39.697
Looking at her was like looking
at Arp 273, the rose of galaxies.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.704
Anastasia.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.165
- Rider.
- Anastasia.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.916
- George.
- Present.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.334
Maria.

20:52.543 --> 20:53.627
Maria Sanchez.

20:53.836 --> 20:55.045
Oh, uh, here.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.930
Can I help you, Mr. Teacher?

21:05.139 --> 21:06.640
Maria's five-second
rule experiment.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.309
I expect it
at the end of the term.

21:08.517 --> 21:11.061
No, um, actually,
I'm not Maria Sanchez.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.689
I'm just here for a week.
I'm home-schooled.

21:13.898 --> 21:14.940
Aren't we all?

21:18.360 --> 21:20.488
- Sarah.
- Here.

21:20.696 --> 21:21.614
Harry.

21:24.325 --> 21:25.659
No.

21:25.868 --> 21:26.911
- No.
- Honey?

21:27.119 --> 21:28.496
Not in a classroom.

21:28.704 --> 21:29.872
- It's my mom.
- Liam, are you there?

21:31.499 --> 21:34.168
<i>Hola, mi nombre
es Maria Sanchez.</i>

21:35.628 --> 21:37.296
No,
I'm Maria Sanchez.

21:37.505 --> 21:39.882
She has, like, a lung or a brain thing.
It's pretty bad.

22:19.964 --> 22:22.633
J"Ah

22:25.594 --> 22:28.180
J"Ah

22:48.909 --> 22:49.952
on!

22:57.084 --> 22:58.210
Hi, penis breath.

22:58.419 --> 22:59.795
Where's Maria?

23:00.004 --> 23:03.090
Oh, she's sick with a lung
and a brain thing.

23:03.299 --> 23:05.551
It's at... My name is actually
not "penis breath," it's Liam.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.177
I'm BDC.

23:07.386 --> 23:11.015
- BDC?
- Brian Denis Chad.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.309
That's like three
first names, sort of.

23:13.517 --> 23:16.562
No. That's a first,
middle, and last.

23:16.770 --> 23:18.689
Yeah, in that...
In your case, yeah.

23:24.987 --> 23:28.324
Earthquake, Maria!

23:30.075 --> 23:30.743
Good.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.355
Hello!

23:59.563 --> 24:02.232
Liam, hello. Honey, is
everything all right?

24:03.734 --> 24:06.487
Liam? Hello?

24:06.695 --> 24:09.740
Hey, Mom. No, it's fine.

24:09.949 --> 24:12.076
It was a wrong number. Sorry,
I didn't mean to call you.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.328
Oh. Okay,
I love you, sweetie.

24:14.536 --> 24:15.955
I love you, too. Bye.

24:33.973 --> 24:36.684
You're an even bigger
nerd than me.

24:36.892 --> 24:41.271
Oh, yeah, I just figured
I'd warm my pants up. Toasty.

24:41.480 --> 24:45.776
Oh, I forget to tell you
BDC is an asshole.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.987
Yeah,
I figured that out.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.531
So, what? Everybody
calls me "Maria" now?

24:50.739 --> 24:54.451
It's caught on pretty fast.
I mean, your name's Maria now.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.203
It's pretty. Work with it.

25:06.422 --> 25:10.050
Hey, new kid on the block.

25:17.307 --> 25:19.143
- She has a limp?
- Yeah.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.396
A real irregular gait.
Not weird, just irregular,

25:22.604 --> 25:24.606
like she puts all of her
movement onto her strongest leg.

25:24.815 --> 25:27.568
Kinda like one of those gimpy
dogs that has all that courage.

25:27.776 --> 25:30.362
Liam, are you sure
that this girl is real?

25:30.571 --> 25:32.906
She kinda reminds me of a
cyborg, but she's very real.

25:33.115 --> 25:35.451
- Did she say anything else to you?
- Yeah, I told you.

25:35.659 --> 25:38.579
She looked at me and then
she smiled like this.

25:38.787 --> 25:41.123
And then she said,
"Ooh, hello there, you."

25:43.375 --> 25:46.295
- I think she likes you.
- Whoa!

25:46.503 --> 25:48.213
Okay, uh,

25:48.422 --> 25:51.800
wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,
wow, wow, wow, wow, wow!

25:52.009 --> 25:55.095
Uh, I don't know.
That's... Mmm, okay.

25:55.304 --> 25:57.014
I knew this would happen.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.641
I mean, if I'd had a girl,
she would stay with me forever,

25:59.850 --> 26:01.643
like, even after
she got married.

26:01.852 --> 26:05.064
But a guy like you, meet a girl
and then you're gone.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.232
- What? That's not true.
- Yeah, it is true.

26:07.441 --> 26:09.276
Grandma warned me it was gonna
happen, and she was right.

26:09.485 --> 26:12.780
Grandma, that's not true.
Mom, you're my best friend.

26:14.031 --> 26:15.783
I love you infinity.

26:15.991 --> 26:18.827
- That's a long time.
- Yeah, it's the most.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.463
It wasn't
until the next day

26:29.671 --> 26:33.926
that I realized in that one
minute between 1:44 and 1:45,

26:34.134 --> 26:37.054
right near the southwest
handicapped bathroom,

26:37.262 --> 26:38.305
we would pass each other.

26:38.514 --> 26:39.515
Hi!

26:41.016 --> 26:43.102
Every day.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.026
Hello.

26:54.488 --> 26:55.906
Hey!

26:58.325 --> 26:59.576
Hey!

27:10.087 --> 27:11.130
Whoo!

27:19.221 --> 27:22.558
Are you... Can I ask?

27:22.766 --> 27:25.435
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
- We haven't really talked about this.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.312
I just feel like you're
moving so fast already.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.232
Are you thinking about
sleeping with her?

27:30.440 --> 27:32.484
Oh, Mom! I mean,
Grandma's right here.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.570
She's eating.
She's not listening.

27:34.778 --> 27:37.489
- Grandma, you want a fire truck?
- Yes, dear.

27:37.698 --> 27:38.991
Okay, so, are you
thinking of sex?

27:40.826 --> 27:42.452
Yes, honey.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.788
- No, Mom, I'm talking to Liam.
- I mean, no.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.790
No, I mean, I was sort of
thinking about touching her leg,

27:46.999 --> 27:49.126
touching her leg at school is
sort of like a legend, so...

27:49.334 --> 27:52.212
Liam, I'm not stupid.
No one celebrates virginity.

27:52.421 --> 27:53.255
I mean, we should.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.508
- High five!
- Right?

27:56.717 --> 27:58.886
Yeah! Now, I know I'm a mom,

27:59.094 --> 28:01.471
but I know you boys
think about it,

28:01.680 --> 28:03.974
I change your sheets, and I know the
pressure you put on yourselves,

28:04.183 --> 28:05.893
but listen, I mean,

28:06.101 --> 28:09.396
you guys have gone so far
already that I think, you know,

28:09.605 --> 28:10.814
I think she might be...

28:12.065 --> 28:13.525
-a bit of a whore.
- Whoa!

28:13.734 --> 28:15.485
- I mean, I hate
that I had to say that.

28:17.571 --> 28:19.281
You know, I think maybe I should
eat lunch in the cafeteria.

28:19.489 --> 28:21.325
So you can have lunch
with the one-legged girl?

28:21.533 --> 28:23.452
Well, it just doesn't seem
like a lot of other moms

28:23.660 --> 28:25.120
are here with
their kids at school.

28:25.329 --> 28:27.122
That cafeteria serves
homeless-person food.

28:27.331 --> 28:29.166
I'm adding years
to your life here.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.710
Well, I just feel like maybe I should
eat lunch with the other students.

28:31.919 --> 28:33.670
If you were having lunch with
a guy, I'd be fine with that.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.505
You'd be fine if your mom
was dude-dating?

28:35.714 --> 28:36.840
Yeah, yeah, I would.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.800
I mean, if he was
a nice gentleman.

28:39.009 --> 28:41.303
- Okay, but-- - I'm not
allowed to have sugar.

28:41.511 --> 28:44.014
No, you can have sugar.

28:44.223 --> 28:47.726
I don't care. Makes you
grumpy-pants, but... Whatever.

28:47.935 --> 28:50.395
Okay. Well, I'm gonna stealth out of the
car and you're not gonna be able to see me

28:50.604 --> 28:51.647
'cause I'm gonna be
so stealthy. Ninja.

28:54.274 --> 28:55.943
Liam, you left the door open!

28:59.154 --> 29:00.906
God damn it!

29:02.950 --> 29:06.328
Ugh! Dang it!

29:10.874 --> 29:11.833
Ugh!

29:29.935 --> 29:31.061
Oh! Hey, Maria.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.897
I actually just
called you last night

29:34.106 --> 29:37.609
and I got some Spanish
Antonio Banderas guy.

29:37.818 --> 29:40.320
- Is that your dad?
- No, that's probably Maria's number.

29:40.529 --> 29:41.947
- Oh, yeah! Right. I didn't--
- Spanish, yeah.

29:42.155 --> 29:43.365
I don't speak Spanish,
so I didn't...

29:43.573 --> 29:44.783
Didn't occur to me, yeah.

29:44.992 --> 29:46.493
Oh! Uh, shoot, I better go.

29:46.702 --> 29:48.328
I have to say hi to a girl.

29:48.537 --> 29:49.538
Yeah, me, too. Oh, hey!
One second.

29:49.746 --> 29:50.539
I actually
do need your number,

29:50.747 --> 29:51.748
your mother's number.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.166
Oh, okay.

29:53.375 --> 29:55.961
Oh, okay, now,
I can call this nu...

29:56.169 --> 29:57.629
I can speak to your...

29:57.838 --> 30:00.173
- To your... Your dad?
- Nope, just my mom.

30:00.382 --> 30:02.384
Fuck yeah! Okay. Yeah,
it's just procedural stuff.

30:02.592 --> 30:04.594
I figured out
that at 1:58 p.m.,

30:04.803 --> 30:06.596
if I cut through the gym
to the east hall,

30:06.805 --> 30:09.224
I would pass her again,
get one more hello.

30:19.401 --> 30:22.321
Oh, hey! Deja vu.

30:27.868 --> 30:29.202
- Hey!
- Hey!

30:29.411 --> 30:31.538
Hey!
You ready to go home, bucko?

30:31.747 --> 30:34.333
Actually,
I have badminton practice.

30:34.541 --> 30:38.128
Badminton? What? But you've done the week.
We said one week.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.339
Yeah, the badminton team
needs me.

30:41.590 --> 30:44.718
Sanchez. Bad.

30:46.303 --> 30:48.638
So I'm just gonna
go practice after

30:48.847 --> 30:52.225
and then maybe just
a few more months of school.

30:52.434 --> 30:54.478
A few more months?
Are you joking?

30:54.686 --> 30:57.606
I just maybe feel
like I needed to adjust,

30:57.814 --> 31:00.525
and then I'll rewrite the exam
and I'll double-ace it,

31:00.734 --> 31:02.694
and I'll go to Cambridge and
I'll study with Stephen Hawking.

31:02.903 --> 31:04.988
It's just a little bit of
badminton at school. It's fine.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.573
Jump in the car
and we'll talk.

31:06.782 --> 31:08.825
Well, I have to practice
right now, like right now.

31:09.034 --> 31:10.619
But the... It's fish Friday!

31:12.579 --> 31:14.831
- It is?
- Well, it's Friday.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.958
- Well, what kinda fish?
- Rainbow trout.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.045
No, I... Sorry,
I gotta go to badminton.

31:20.253 --> 31:21.963
Sorry, Mom. I love you.
Bye, save some for me.

31:31.598 --> 31:33.350
What are you doing here?

31:33.558 --> 31:34.684
Badminton. You?

31:34.893 --> 31:37.354
Badminton.
Where'd you get that?

31:37.562 --> 31:39.898
- Over there.
-lt's game.

31:40.107 --> 31:41.650
- When... What?
-lt's game.

31:41.858 --> 31:43.402
- What do you mean?
-lt's lingo.

31:43.610 --> 31:47.072
- Lingo for the game?
- No, lingo for the racket.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.907
The racket is game.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.080
Who are they?

32:04.589 --> 32:06.550
They're the angels of death.

32:19.896 --> 32:22.107
- Liam?
- No, this is Mr. Kelly, the principal.

32:22.315 --> 32:26.528
Uh, Listen,
I know your boy, Maria--

32:26.736 --> 32:28.613
Liam. His name is Liam.
ls he okay?

32:28.822 --> 32:31.450
Right. Yeah, of course,
he goes by Liam at home.

32:31.658 --> 32:33.660
Yeah, no, he's fine,
he's okay.

32:33.869 --> 32:38.790
Uh, like, I understand him staying on.
You know, off the record, um,

32:38.999 --> 32:44.129
I'm single, and, you know, I remember
the other week you came by and you,

32:44.337 --> 32:46.089
uh, over by the trophy case,
you were asking me

32:46.298 --> 32:48.133
if I was impressed
with your homeschooling

32:48.341 --> 32:50.719
and I just wanted to say,
"Yeah, I am."

32:53.430 --> 32:54.931
What?

32:55.140 --> 32:56.391
lam. Hello?

32:56.600 --> 32:59.811
- Is that...
- Uh!

33:00.020 --> 33:01.480
Uh...

33:03.356 --> 33:07.569
Mmm-mmm... Hmm...

33:07.777 --> 33:09.279
Mmm, mmm, mmm...

33:09.488 --> 33:11.823
Oh!

33:36.264 --> 33:37.766
Maria, I swear to God.

33:42.562 --> 33:43.730
Come on!

33:50.111 --> 33:52.614
- Nice game, Maria.
- Hit the showers, boys.

33:54.991 --> 33:57.410
Yeah, right.
I shower alone.

34:04.876 --> 34:08.380
Ah! I'm like
the moon or something

34:08.588 --> 34:10.757
slowly moving away
from Mother Earth.

34:10.966 --> 34:13.009
3.87 centimeters
a year, actually.

34:13.217 --> 34:14.678
It's a thing. It really is.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.101
Thanks for the fish.

34:25.313 --> 34:26.147
Yeah, sure.

34:32.779 --> 34:35.282
I love you infinity.

34:54.175 --> 34:56.553
- Hey.
- Okey.

34:57.721 --> 34:59.764
I hear you loud and clear,

34:59.973 --> 35:01.850
and I know why you wanna
stay at school

35:02.058 --> 35:03.476
until the end of the term.

35:03.685 --> 35:06.229
You're rebelling
with a capital R,

35:06.438 --> 35:10.609
and I think it's a good thing, a necessary
thing for our success at Cambridge.

35:10.817 --> 35:14.195
So let's do it now together

35:14.404 --> 35:17.574
and get it out of your
system before university

35:17.782 --> 35:20.368
in a safe and
responsible way, okay?

35:20.577 --> 35:22.245
Do what together?

35:22.454 --> 35:23.913
RebeL

35:24.122 --> 35:25.915
Your rebellion.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.542
I want you to have friends,

35:27.751 --> 35:30.170
teach you your
teenage rebellion.

35:30.378 --> 35:31.588
Just when I think I know you,

35:31.796 --> 35:33.590
you surprise the living
bejesus out of me.

35:33.798 --> 35:35.050
Thank you.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.719
Why is it weird to say
my mom's cool

35:37.927 --> 35:39.596
and she's my best friend?

35:41.431 --> 35:43.475
- It's not weird.
- No, it is.

35:45.685 --> 35:47.354
At school, moms aren't cool.

35:51.399 --> 35:52.233
They should be.

35:54.903 --> 35:55.820
I love you.

35:57.364 --> 35:59.324
Beep boop,
my little robot man.

35:59.532 --> 36:01.201
<i>Oh, beep hoop.</i>

36:01.409 --> 36:05.872
You power down now.
You got work tomorrow.

36:06.081 --> 36:08.375
- Beep boop, mmm.
- You're still buzzing.

36:08.583 --> 36:09.626
Beep hoop, oh!

36:11.044 --> 36:13.338
Okay, brainstorming.

36:13.546 --> 36:15.757
What are outlets
that teens rebel with?

36:17.175 --> 36:19.928
- Liam.
- Swimming after I eat.

36:20.136 --> 36:22.430
I think you could think
a little bit bigger.

36:22.639 --> 36:24.516
- Mmm.
- Liam.

36:24.724 --> 36:26.976
Um, not wearing pants.

36:27.185 --> 36:31.314
Mm, how about
staying out late?

36:31.523 --> 36:32.607
That's good.

36:34.275 --> 36:35.110
With girls.

36:36.486 --> 36:38.154
- Ooh.
- Skipping school.

36:39.614 --> 36:42.659
Ooh. Uh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Uh, swearing.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.994
Bingo, bango. Yes.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.541
- Getting my nose pierced.
- No way. No way.

36:49.749 --> 36:52.502
That is permanent. Why don't
we start with swearing?

36:52.711 --> 36:54.921
Go ahead. Say the big one.

36:55.130 --> 36:56.297
Dicks.

36:56.506 --> 36:58.967
Why would you say that?
Say the big one.

36:59.175 --> 37:01.302
The "F" one with the...

37:01.511 --> 37:03.263
Fuck.

37:04.514 --> 37:06.099
- What?
- Fuck.

37:06.307 --> 37:07.934
I didn't quite hear you.

37:09.936 --> 37:12.856
- Fuck.
- So weird to hear you say that.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.274
- Okay, say it again.
- Fuck.

37:14.482 --> 37:15.859
- With conviction!
- Fuck!

37:16.067 --> 37:20.071
- Like an afro singer.
- Fuck!

37:20.280 --> 37:22.449
Now point to that book
and say, "Fuck off, book!"

37:22.657 --> 37:25.618
-"Fuck off, book!"
- Yeah, do it again, uh...

37:25.827 --> 37:27.495
- Fuck you, uh, chalkboard.
- Yeah!

37:27.704 --> 37:29.122
Fuck you, chalk.

37:29.330 --> 37:30.582
Fuck you, chair.
Fuck you, table.

37:30.790 --> 37:31.958
Fuck you, highlighters.

37:32.167 --> 37:33.418
Fuck you, pencil,
fuck you, red pens,

37:33.626 --> 37:35.128
fuck you, black pens,
fuck you, blue pens.

37:35.336 --> 37:38.423
- And fuck you--
- No, don't you effing dare.

37:38.631 --> 37:40.800
No, "F" for fail.

37:42.469 --> 37:43.386
Sorry.

37:44.804 --> 37:45.638
I forgive you.

37:48.975 --> 37:52.145
Now that word is also a verb.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.982
Liam, I can see it written

37:56.191 --> 37:57.484
all over your face

37:57.692 --> 37:59.527
and there is no easy
way to do this.

38:00.904 --> 38:02.113
When I say "Trojan,"

38:02.322 --> 38:03.907
what is your first thought?

38:07.410 --> 38:10.538
The ancient city of Troy,
Hector and Achilles,

38:10.747 --> 38:13.124
the Greek and Trojan soldiers
famous for their bravery

38:13.333 --> 38:16.586
in battle and their
seven-layered ox-hide shields.

38:19.672 --> 38:21.299
And sodomy.

38:21.508 --> 38:24.302
So the Trojans are still
very much alive today.

38:24.511 --> 38:26.262
They are living in there.

38:26.471 --> 38:29.724
Think of that as
a one-layer latex shield.

38:29.933 --> 38:32.435
Who would go into battle without one
of those on their penis, right?

38:32.644 --> 38:34.604
- Right, that's a good point.
- Okay, so...

38:36.356 --> 38:40.151
I want you to practice
in here alone in the dark.

38:42.529 --> 38:43.613
I'll be in the kitchen
if you need me.

38:50.078 --> 38:51.913
Oh, hello, Anastasia.

38:52.121 --> 38:53.915
You see, I have
this condom here.

38:54.123 --> 38:56.835
I was wondering if you'd like
to have intercourse with me.

38:57.043 --> 38:58.545
Oh, you would?

38:58.753 --> 38:59.546
Great.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.727
- Mom?
- Yeah.

39:14.936 --> 39:16.104
Eight seconds.

39:18.815 --> 39:21.860
I don't know what
happened, but eventually her...

39:22.068 --> 39:22.694
Hello!

39:24.362 --> 39:25.697
...turned into...
- Hey.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.408
...which then became...

39:30.118 --> 39:31.536
Until finally...

39:37.500 --> 39:41.212
We were a 110%
off each other.

39:41.421 --> 39:43.131
Wow. Crazy.

39:44.757 --> 39:48.094
Oh, frig! Oh, frig!

40:01.900 --> 40:02.984
You look like
you need a hug.

40:05.570 --> 40:08.406
No, no, no, I'm not allowed
to touch the students.

40:08.615 --> 40:09.949
But you definitely look
like you need a hug.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.457
Come with me.
Let's talk about your future.

40:19.459 --> 40:21.044
So what did you say
this was called again?

40:21.252 --> 40:22.170
Astronomy.

40:22.378 --> 40:24.797
Astronomy. Astronomy.

40:25.006 --> 40:30.511
I don't see astronomy in here,
but I do see massage therapy.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.180
Yeah, I was thinking
more astronomy.

40:32.388 --> 40:33.848
Yeah, but you could
get your certificate

40:34.057 --> 40:35.600
in eight months
and you're done.

40:35.808 --> 40:37.060
Okay.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.895
Besides, you look like
a massage therapist.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.356
Do you know how good that is?
You get to touch people.

40:41.564 --> 40:43.858
I can't touch anybody here.
I'm just saying,

40:44.067 --> 40:44.859
you gotta keep your
options open, you know?

40:45.068 --> 40:46.402
You know, a few years ago,

40:46.611 --> 40:48.529
there was a kid who did
a string of B-and-E's.

40:48.738 --> 40:50.698
He got sent to the state pen
for three years.

40:50.907 --> 40:53.868
But he fast-tracked
a sociology degree for free.

40:54.077 --> 40:55.244
I'm not saying that's the
route you need to go,

40:55.453 --> 40:56.829
but something
to think about.

40:57.038 --> 40:58.164
You know, my whole life,

40:58.373 --> 40:59.791
all I've wanted
to do is astronomy.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.334
All right.
Why don't we do this?

41:01.542 --> 41:03.836
Why don't we take
our personality/job test

41:04.045 --> 41:06.130
on the computer,
and see what that says?

41:07.757 --> 41:08.591
Okay.

41:10.009 --> 41:11.469
Hey, that... The guy

41:11.678 --> 41:13.179
who did the B-and-E's

41:13.388 --> 41:17.183
and then went to jail,
uh, what did he become?

41:23.481 --> 41:24.774
At a party, do you interact

41:24.983 --> 41:27.735
with everyone, few, yourself?

41:32.323 --> 41:33.032
Everyone.

41:34.659 --> 41:36.119
Yourself, C.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.329
Do you walk with big steps,

41:38.538 --> 41:39.664
varied steps, little steps?

41:45.503 --> 41:46.462
Big steps!

41:48.131 --> 41:49.507
Little steps.

41:49.716 --> 41:52.802
When meeting new people,
do you introduce yourself,

41:53.011 --> 41:54.762
wait to be introduced,
be silent?

41:59.225 --> 42:01.853
You introduce yourself.

42:02.061 --> 42:03.271
Be silent.

42:11.571 --> 42:14.365
Ugh, why can't I
be the guy who picks A?

42:15.867 --> 42:17.535
Oh,
look at that 'stache!

42:17.744 --> 42:20.038
Okay, Liam, it is... It is the
easiest thing in the world

42:20.246 --> 42:21.039
to entertain a woman.

42:21.247 --> 42:22.457
Honestly, you just

42:22.665 --> 42:24.292
ask her questions about herself.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.753
Get her talking.
Pretend I'm Anastasia, okay?

42:26.961 --> 42:28.129
You're not Anastasia.

42:28.337 --> 42:31.007
You are Liam, I'm Anastasia!

42:31.215 --> 42:33.885
- Comment on my looks.
- You look like my mom.

42:34.093 --> 42:36.596
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

42:36.804 --> 42:39.891
Do you wanna talk
about my... my smile?

42:40.099 --> 42:41.684
You have a nice smile.
It makes me smile.

42:41.893 --> 42:44.187
Do you wanna say something
about how I smell?

42:46.689 --> 42:47.523
You smell like my mom.

42:47.732 --> 42:49.692
Well, your mom smells good.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.652
Look, Anastasia,
don't you think

42:51.861 --> 42:53.446
it's a little a bit weird
that my mom

42:53.654 --> 42:54.572
is on a date with us?

42:56.699 --> 43:00.369
No, I think that you
have a very cool mother.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.330
Yeah, who has a loser
for a son.

43:12.131 --> 43:13.800
Liam! What are you doing?

43:14.008 --> 43:15.551
Something I should have
done a long time ago.

43:40.368 --> 43:42.411
- Maria.
- Oh, great.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.497
I got your personality
and job match back.

43:45.665 --> 43:46.916
Good news!

43:47.125 --> 43:49.794
You know, some stories
have a sad ending.

43:50.002 --> 43:53.714
This one, I believe,
is a very happy ending.

43:53.923 --> 43:55.758
Massage therapist,
just like I thought.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.556
What's wrong?
Come on in. Sit down.

44:03.683 --> 44:05.685
- It's your father, isn't it?
- No.

44:05.893 --> 44:08.020
- What did your father do?
- Nothing.

44:08.229 --> 44:10.314
It's okay.
Those are tough questions.

44:10.523 --> 44:12.441
It's a girl thing.
It's a girl problem.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.193
I have a problem with a girl.

44:14.402 --> 44:15.444
Oh, it's a girl problem.

44:18.364 --> 44:21.159
See this cup?
This cup is you.

44:21.367 --> 44:25.746
- Okay.
- Sweet, precious, gentle.

44:25.955 --> 44:27.123
It's got a heart.

44:31.377 --> 44:33.045
Do not share your cup
with someone

44:33.254 --> 44:34.797
unless you're ready
to have it smashed.

44:37.466 --> 44:38.301
Now put it back together.

44:45.057 --> 44:45.892
I can't put it
back together.

44:51.272 --> 44:53.107
Hey, kid!
You want some candy?

44:53.316 --> 44:55.151
- Mom? Hey!
- Come on.

44:55.359 --> 44:57.612
I got some good shit in here.

44:57.820 --> 44:59.697
- What are you talking about?
- Come on, kid, get in the car.

44:59.906 --> 45:01.115
You're being weird.

45:01.324 --> 45:02.533
What are you? A pussy?

45:02.742 --> 45:03.451
<i>Pussy, pussy, pussy, PUSSY,</i>

45:03.659 --> 45:05.036
pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy!

45:05.244 --> 45:06.787
All right.

45:08.706 --> 45:11.667
I can't believe you got
in the car so quickly!

45:11.876 --> 45:14.378
- What if I was a pervert?
- What? You're my mom.

45:14.587 --> 45:16.505
- What is that?
- Weed.

45:16.714 --> 45:18.424
Okay, now you're bound

45:18.633 --> 45:19.967
to get pressured into it
at some point,

45:20.176 --> 45:21.677
so let's just try it now

45:21.886 --> 45:22.970
in a safe environment.

45:23.179 --> 45:24.430
Well, where did you--
where did you--

45:24.639 --> 45:25.932
Where did you get this?

45:27.850 --> 45:30.228
Where-- ls this a...

45:30.436 --> 45:31.687
This is a test.

45:31.896 --> 45:33.022
This is a test.

45:33.231 --> 45:35.524
- No. Say "no" to drugs.
- No, no.

45:35.733 --> 45:36.943
No, honey, it's not a test.

45:37.151 --> 45:39.779
This is a-- This is
a supervised first try.

45:41.280 --> 45:42.698
It's called a "hotbox."

45:42.907 --> 45:44.951
You get, like, a little bit
of a better high,

45:45.159 --> 45:46.702
because it's like
you're in a box.

45:46.911 --> 45:48.120
You serious? Yeah, I know.

45:48.329 --> 45:49.789
No, I know the physics of it.

45:49.997 --> 45:51.290
I just don't know the ethics.

45:52.750 --> 45:53.417
Are you...

45:56.420 --> 45:57.380
You shouldn't sm--

46:00.758 --> 46:01.425
Ooh!

46:03.427 --> 46:04.095
It's burny.

46:05.972 --> 46:07.640
It's Bernie Sanders.

46:07.848 --> 46:09.767
Are we gonna get--
Um, are we gonna get

46:09.976 --> 46:11.602
caught or busted or...

46:11.811 --> 46:13.396
No, you're with me and Grandma.

46:13.604 --> 46:14.981
Here, take a hit.

46:15.189 --> 46:17.733
Is it indica or sativa
or ruderalis?

46:17.942 --> 46:19.610
I don't know.

46:19.819 --> 46:21.279
Well, they have
different THC levels.

46:21.487 --> 46:23.030
Well, go ahead and hurry up
and hit it.

46:23.239 --> 46:24.407
I don't wanna get caught.

46:31.539 --> 46:32.331
What do you mean,
get caught?

46:32.540 --> 46:33.624
I thought this was...

46:33.833 --> 46:34.709
I thought it was prescription.

46:34.917 --> 46:36.168
- Grandma?
- Mm-hmm.

46:36.377 --> 46:38.963
- Well, it's legal for her.
- But not for us?

46:39.171 --> 46:41.549
Technically... Technically, no.

46:44.385 --> 46:46.971
-- Oh, my God!
He scared me.

46:47.179 --> 46:48.681
Hide that. Hide the joint!
Hide the joint!

46:53.311 --> 46:54.895
- Hey, hi.
- Hello.

46:55.104 --> 46:57.023
- Hello.
- Principal Kelly!

46:57.231 --> 47:00.318
Wow! It definitely smells
like marijuana in here.

47:00.526 --> 47:03.904
Yeah, Grandma's arthritis
is a real knock-out.

47:04.113 --> 47:05.823
- Oh! Hi, Grandma!
-lt's Grandma.

47:06.032 --> 47:07.825
Yeah. Look, I'm no
disciplinarian, okay?

47:08.034 --> 47:09.160
- Thank God!
- I just play one for work.

47:09.368 --> 47:11.245
- So, I'm fun a guy.
- Yeah.

47:11.454 --> 47:14.874
Um, listen, I wanna just...
We got disconnected before

47:15.082 --> 47:17.793
and I would just love

47:18.002 --> 47:21.839
to cook you kebabs
at my place.

47:22.048 --> 47:24.008
It's a great view,
if you're into that.

47:24.216 --> 47:26.886
Um, maybe some wine,
if you like.

47:27.094 --> 47:29.472
Maybe a mutually-
agreed-upon kiss,

47:29.680 --> 47:31.349
if you are into that.

47:31.557 --> 47:35.561
Okay. No. Um, look,
I-- I should be clear.

47:35.770 --> 47:39.065
I have very strict rules
about not hooking up

47:39.273 --> 47:40.900
with teachers
at my school. Right.

47:41.108 --> 47:44.153
- But anyone outside ofschoolofageis".
- Mm-hmm.

47:44.362 --> 47:46.197
...fair game, and you're
your own school,

47:46.405 --> 47:47.740
so you're fair game.

47:47.948 --> 47:52.161
I sort of have a rule
about dating my son's...

47:52.370 --> 47:55.122
My son's...
My son's principals.

47:56.582 --> 47:58.042
- So...
- Yeah.

47:59.710 --> 48:01.379
You guys drive safe. Okay.

48:01.587 --> 48:02.254
Bye!

48:05.257 --> 48:07.218
- Holy buckets.
- Holy buckets is right.

48:07.426 --> 48:09.053
That was totally cookadoo.

48:10.721 --> 48:12.223
But I think he didn't know
we were high.

48:18.229 --> 48:19.563
- Oh, my God!
- What?

48:19.772 --> 48:21.440
That's her.
That's Anastasia.

48:21.649 --> 48:23.401
- The girl with the limp?
- Yeah.

48:23.609 --> 48:25.945
- What the heck?
- She's our neighbor?

48:26.153 --> 48:28.489
How have I never
seen her here before?

48:28.697 --> 48:31.200
You are so much more
handsome than that guy.

48:31.409 --> 48:32.493
She's gonna flip out
when she finds out

48:32.701 --> 48:33.869
you're on
the badminton team.

48:34.078 --> 48:36.705
- No.
- Do you wanna smoke any more?

48:36.914 --> 48:38.124
- No.
- No, thank you.

48:38.332 --> 48:39.792
I'm pretty high now.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.794
Oh, crap. It says,

48:42.002 --> 48:44.797
"Do not drive or operate
any heavy machinery." Oops!

49:22.001 --> 49:23.836
All right, mate?

49:24.044 --> 49:25.337
Good night, penis breath.

49:26.630 --> 49:27.798
Oh, I'm such a loser.

49:32.386 --> 49:34.430
Maria, you got no shot.

49:34.638 --> 49:36.390
Okay. Girls, they just...

49:36.599 --> 49:38.017
They just date dicks.

49:38.225 --> 49:39.393
Love guys who
treat 'em like dicks,

49:39.602 --> 49:41.353
and girls just love dicks.

49:41.562 --> 49:43.439
Then I'm gonna be
Anastasia's dick.

49:45.191 --> 49:47.485
Well, then you gotta make
a bold dick move, man.

49:47.693 --> 49:49.570
- You know, show her you can compete.
- Yeah.

49:49.778 --> 49:51.655
- Girls love that shit.
- Yeah.

49:54.283 --> 49:54.992
Yeah. Wait...

49:58.996 --> 50:01.457
Uh, you mean like kiss her?

50:01.665 --> 50:03.751
- Well, did she try to kiss you?
- No.

50:03.959 --> 50:06.086
- Mmm. Did you see her bobos?
- No.

50:06.295 --> 50:08.506
- Have you ever seen bobos, Liam?
- Yes.

50:08.714 --> 50:10.508
- You're full of shit.
- No, I have!

50:15.596 --> 50:17.223
- Hey.
- Hey-

50:17.431 --> 50:18.516
- I'm gonna go to bed.
- Okay.

50:18.724 --> 50:20.017
- Good night.
- Good night.

50:20.226 --> 50:22.102
That's absolutely
disgusting,

50:22.311 --> 50:23.354
but hot at the same time.

50:23.562 --> 50:26.232
You know, your mom
is really hot.

50:26.440 --> 50:27.608
Like she could be your sister.

50:28.817 --> 50:29.527
God, I'd play

50:29.735 --> 50:30.778
all 18 holes of that.

50:30.986 --> 50:32.738
Yeah. Yeah.

50:34.698 --> 50:35.658
Hey, what's their problem?

50:42.414 --> 50:44.416
- Holy fuck!
- What? What?

50:44.625 --> 50:48.629
Uh, Maria Sanchez is dead.

51:02.560 --> 51:03.727
The day Maria died...

51:06.063 --> 51:08.065
was the best day
of my life.

51:14.905 --> 51:16.907
Suddenly everyone treated me
like I had died,

51:18.867 --> 51:20.202
but I never felt more alive.

51:24.790 --> 51:25.457
Hey.

51:28.794 --> 51:30.462
I'm a total dick.

51:30.671 --> 51:33.757
Do you know I never said
a single word to Maria,

51:33.966 --> 51:35.593
but now I kinda feel like
because of you

51:35.801 --> 51:37.052
I get the chance to change that.

51:37.261 --> 51:39.597
God! I love you, Maria Sanchez.

51:43.475 --> 51:44.768
I'm s-- sorry, Maria.

51:48.230 --> 51:51.108
Most people didn't give
a shit about Maria.

51:51.317 --> 51:53.527
I mean, Aisley sure as hell
wasn't her friend.

51:53.736 --> 51:56.655
I guess it's like nobody
really cares until--

51:56.864 --> 51:57.906
You lose a leg.

51:59.617 --> 52:00.492
Yeah.

52:06.248 --> 52:08.500
Um, I'm gonna be
right back, okay?

52:08.709 --> 52:09.960
- Okay.
- Yeah.

52:15.341 --> 52:16.634
Oh, God, ew!

52:16.842 --> 52:20.137
Bold dick move.
You gotta do it.

52:36.403 --> 52:37.446
You didn't cut him up?

52:37.655 --> 52:39.323
Uh, no, I didn't have the heart.

52:48.874 --> 52:51.669
Hey, you live in
Greenwood Street, right?

52:51.877 --> 52:52.836
Yeah.

52:53.045 --> 52:55.631
One sec. Sorry.

53:00.511 --> 53:02.054
Fire alarm.

53:02.262 --> 53:03.806
My mom and I practiced this at home.
Follow me.

53:05.724 --> 53:08.394
Fire, fire, fire,
fire, fire, fire!

53:49.017 --> 53:50.227
- Rum.
- Rum.

53:51.687 --> 53:52.396
Rum Tum Tugger.

53:59.445 --> 54:01.321
I know. It's rummy.

54:03.907 --> 54:04.700
Mmm.

54:06.118 --> 54:07.995
- Mmm.
- What? ls it skunked?

54:09.538 --> 54:10.414
I think it's gone bad.

54:14.376 --> 54:15.210
I don't think it's bad.

54:17.921 --> 54:18.756
Mmm.

54:20.841 --> 54:23.093
Gross, but the least worst.

54:23.302 --> 54:24.261
Oh, God, honey,
I love you,

54:24.470 --> 54:26.096
but that is
a pussy drink.

54:26.305 --> 54:29.224
- Oh, that's perfect!
- No. No.

54:29.433 --> 54:32.478
Like bad pussy,
like you are the pussy.

54:32.686 --> 54:36.190
So wait, I get... We wanna get
the pussy, not drink the pussy.

54:36.398 --> 54:37.775
I mean, yes,

54:37.983 --> 54:40.235
but what I meant by pussy
in this situation is,

54:40.444 --> 54:42.237
is that it's wimpy. Wimpy.

54:42.446 --> 54:46.575
So drinking a wimpy drink makes
you wimpy and then wimpy...

54:46.784 --> 54:51.538
Wimpy guys don't
get the literal pussy.

54:51.747 --> 54:53.582
If we're gonna
talk anatomy,

54:53.791 --> 54:55.751
-can we talk about balls?
- Sure.

54:55.959 --> 54:58.086
- Balls of steel?
- Mmm-hmm.

54:58.295 --> 55:00.005
I mean,
who came up with that?

55:00.214 --> 55:03.425
My balls are like tiny little
grapes, sensitive, weird.

55:03.634 --> 55:06.386
It's like a metaphor or--

55:06.595 --> 55:08.555
Are there men with
actual balls of steel?

55:50.138 --> 55:50.848
Not afraid.

56:02.109 --> 56:04.194
All right. Have your key
and everything?

56:04.403 --> 56:06.905
Yep, got it all. All ready to go.
Here we go.

56:07.114 --> 56:09.491
Okay. Here we go.

56:09.700 --> 56:11.159
- Ooh! - Oh, man! What was that?

56:11.368 --> 56:13.871
- That's probably a flat tire.
- What?

56:14.079 --> 56:16.290
Yeah. I'll probably just have to
carpool with Anastasia today.

56:16.498 --> 56:19.042
I was... Wait, well, wait. I'll just...
Honey, I'll just change the tire!

56:19.251 --> 56:21.503
Are you sure it's safe to ride
with a peg-legged driver, Li--

56:21.712 --> 56:22.629
Yeah. No, it's gonna be fine.

56:27.467 --> 56:28.927
Whoa!

56:29.136 --> 56:31.221
Huh, almost lost my legs.

56:31.430 --> 56:33.307
I didn't see you
there, Maria.

56:33.515 --> 56:35.058
I got a flat tire.

56:35.267 --> 56:37.144
I've got five bucks for some gas money.
Carpool?

56:38.562 --> 56:39.605
- Yeah, okay.
- Cool.

56:41.106 --> 56:42.441
I love you.

56:45.235 --> 56:47.237
I should let you know
that in a few months,

56:47.446 --> 56:48.572
I'll be leaving
for England.

56:48.780 --> 56:51.575
I'm gonna study
astronomy at Cambridge.

56:51.783 --> 56:55.120
So you should
probably know our time is short.

56:56.538 --> 56:58.916
- Stephen Hawking.
- Okay, thanks.

56:59.124 --> 57:01.418
Yeah. I'm a horoscope
junkie, too.

57:01.627 --> 57:04.004
I read it and then
I will it true.

57:04.212 --> 57:07.883
Don't tell me,
you are a...

57:10.594 --> 57:13.972
I wanna say Libra, but something
in your eyes tells me...

57:15.849 --> 57:17.768
- Virgo.
- Pisces.

57:17.976 --> 57:20.270
Mmm. That's too bad,
I'm a Leo.

57:20.479 --> 57:22.940
- Not compatible.
- Nuts.

57:23.148 --> 57:25.108
Those 14 minutes
in Anastasia's truck

57:25.317 --> 57:27.402
to and fro school
was my life.

57:27.611 --> 57:29.321
Everything else faded away.

57:29.529 --> 57:32.324
Hey, you know, every song,
every good song,

57:32.532 --> 57:35.035
all you pretty much need
are the words

57:35.243 --> 57:40.374
"woman," "love,"
"heartbreak," "beautiful."

57:41.959 --> 57:43.961
You know what?
You're totally right.

57:44.169 --> 57:45.420
And the word "sex"
a few times.

57:54.179 --> 57:57.057
Some guys had
dinner dates, movie dates.

57:57.265 --> 57:58.100
I had the carpool date.

57:58.308 --> 57:59.101
That's cool. My treat.

58:00.477 --> 58:01.144
Thanks.

58:02.729 --> 58:04.022
Did I just see a picture
of a girl in there?

58:04.231 --> 58:05.190
Oh, no, that's nobody.

58:07.359 --> 58:09.486
Liam?
ls that your girlfriend?

58:11.571 --> 58:13.949
Yeah. Yeah, it is. It is.
It's my girlfriend.

58:14.157 --> 58:15.951
Oh!
Score, Liam.

58:16.159 --> 58:17.160
- Yeah.
-ls she hot?

58:17.369 --> 58:18.453
- Oh, man!
- Let me see.

58:18.662 --> 58:19.538
- No, she's just--
- Let me see.

58:19.746 --> 58:20.622
Let me see.
Let me see.

58:24.793 --> 58:27.045
- Isn't that your mom?
- Yes, it is.

58:27.254 --> 58:30.173
So, Mr. Astronomy,
tell me my future.

58:30.382 --> 58:33.552
You're a Leo. I see a lot
of sunshine in your future.

58:34.553 --> 58:36.555
And?

58:36.763 --> 58:38.598
I mean, you want me to tell you
that everything's gonna be fine

58:38.807 --> 58:40.017
and that
anything's possible.

58:40.225 --> 58:42.060
But that's not
really true, is it?

58:42.269 --> 58:44.646
I mean, women have less opportunities
than men. They get paid less.

58:44.855 --> 58:46.523
White men have way
more opportunities.

58:48.400 --> 58:50.694
Mom!
Mom, grab my hand!

58:50.902 --> 58:53.905
Mom? What are you doing
outside the window?

58:54.114 --> 58:57.200
Mom, you're slippi_ng!
I can feel you slipplng!

58:57.409 --> 58:58.744
Mom! Oh!

59:01.121 --> 59:02.998
Like, I mean, you've lost something
that everybody else has, your leg.

59:04.833 --> 59:07.544
- Yeah, I know.
- So you know no fear.

59:08.920 --> 59:10.338
You know anything
is possible

59:10.547 --> 59:12.758
and I think for you,
anything is possible.

59:12.966 --> 59:13.925
I think you're gonna
be an astronaut.

59:15.469 --> 59:17.387
An astronaut?

59:17.596 --> 59:20.599
Wow! That's a lot more than
my daily horoscope said,

59:20.807 --> 59:22.559
all it said was
I was gonna get lucky.

59:47.459 --> 59:49.169
Do you wanna touch it?

59:51.630 --> 59:54.216
- Oh, my God, yes.
- Okay, then touch it.

59:56.968 --> 01:00:00.680
The cancer started out here
and it was extremely rare,

01:00:00.889 --> 01:00:03.433
like three-people rare.

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:04.976
And then all of a sudden,
it was here.

01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:08.730
I hate cancer.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:12.109
And they finally decided
to cut it off here.

01:00:14.402 --> 01:00:17.739
- Thatsucks.
- And it's all gone, for now.

01:00:19.908 --> 01:00:21.201
And I think that
sometimes--

01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:26.289
Yeah, I think sometimes
things happen for a reason

01:00:26.498 --> 01:00:29.751
and sometimes I think things
happen that just suck.

01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:34.506
And the voice
in my head is like,

01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:36.049
"Well, what are
you gonna do now?"

01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:40.178
I don't know why my inner
voice is so manly.

01:00:40.387 --> 01:00:42.764
But I can still do
everything, you know?

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:44.933
You know, run, swim,

01:00:46.768 --> 01:00:47.435
sex.

01:00:50.939 --> 01:00:54.234
Earthquake, Maria!

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:58.780
BDC needs a ride today.

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:00.490
- Hey, hottie.
- Hi, cutie.

01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:02.242
How much?

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:04.202
I'll do anything for a ten,
more for a 20 though.

01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:07.038
- Uh?
- Let's go.

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:08.331
- Hop in, Maria.
- Okay.

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:11.376
Freezing my tits off.

01:01:25.432 --> 01:01:28.101
BDC, stop calling him!

01:01:33.398 --> 01:01:35.692
Paging Maria
Sanchez to the office, please.

01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:44.159
- May I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Maria Sanchez.

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:47.913
No. I'm Maria Sanchez.

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:50.582
And just like that,
Maria was back from the dead.

01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:56.338
- Hablas espafiol?
- I mean, I can count to ten.

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:59.424
- Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco--
- Yeah, I get it.

01:01:59.633 --> 01:02:00.342
I can read Braille.

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:02.636
But you can see.

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:05.472
Yeah, I can see.

01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:08.767
Huh.

01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:11.561
Sorry about the confusion.

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:14.397
I guess it must have been
a bad rumor, you know?

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:18.526
It turns out she was
never even sick.

01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:22.614
She was on an exchange with
another student from Brazil.

01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:26.826
I mean, it was all filed, but
this place is just... Ugh!

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:32.916
It's probably on the old comp.
lfiljustn.

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:38.296
Mmm, nope.

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:39.881
Yeah, so what does
that mean for me?

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:43.176
Not good for you,
but for me, good.

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:45.553
You know, now that you're no
longer an official student here,

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:48.932
I can go on the record that I am
actively pursuing your mother.

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:52.811
And I think my chances
are pretty, pretty good.

01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:56.523
Yeah.

01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:58.775
Yeah.

01:03:01.903 --> 01:03:02.821
Okay, that's...

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:11.538
The five-second
rule is a myth.

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:14.374
Five, ten, 100, it doesn't
matter, it's all the same germs.

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:17.794
Some pretty well-executed
data entry.

01:03:18.003 --> 01:03:19.629
Yeah, I know. We got an A.

01:03:19.838 --> 01:03:22.465
Yeah, you got A's in all
my classes exceptdance.

01:03:22.674 --> 01:03:25.260
Really? Someone
said I was lit.

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.345
I'm pretty good at square dancing.
So I'm a bit cheesed.

01:03:29.848 --> 01:03:31.558
Sorry I'm still alive.

01:03:31.766 --> 01:03:33.768
Me, too.
But I understand.

01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:37.605
Thanks.

01:03:47.866 --> 01:03:50.285
"Anastasia's car, dirty."

01:03:59.878 --> 01:04:02.589
Honey, I know you're upset, but I
did tell you that public school

01:04:02.797 --> 01:04:05.258
is just an institution
for low expectations.

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:08.511
So I want you to forget about
school, forget about the girl.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.222
It's time to party.
So get dressed.

01:04:11.431 --> 01:04:13.600
We're gonna call tonight
your rebound night.

01:04:13.808 --> 01:04:15.352
Here.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:16.353
Everyone's wearing them.

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:25.403
- Cool.
- What did you just say?

01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:27.489
Cool.

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:30.617
I feel like I don't
even know who you are anymore.

01:04:30.825 --> 01:04:34.245
This is so stupid. I don't
know where to find a party.

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:37.665
Well, come on, let's go closer to the
college. There'll be some there.

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:39.042
I'll keep looking.

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:41.628
I'm sorry.
I'm nervous.

01:04:41.836 --> 01:04:43.088
Kind of excited to
let loose a little.

01:04:44.923 --> 01:04:46.299
Whoo!

01:04:46.508 --> 01:04:47.300
Ah, that was fun.

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:50.220
Come on, Autumn. Try it.

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:52.639
Whoo!

01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:58.520
Here, sweetie.
Pussy drink. Take three.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.438
Three for you is a rager,

01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:02.148
'cause you're a lightweight.
Be safe. All right?

01:05:02.357 --> 01:05:04.025
Mmm.

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:07.695
Oh, it hurts. Mmm. And it
tastes like peaches, sparkly.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:11.533
So the rule is we will stay one room
away from you guys at all times

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:14.119
and if anyone asks who
invited you, just say Mike,

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:15.578
because everyone has
a friend named Mike.

01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:17.497
- I don't.
- Aw.

01:05:17.705 --> 01:05:20.083
You do tonight, tiger.
All right. Let's split up.

01:05:21.793 --> 01:05:22.627
<i>Go party.</i>

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:29.592
Hey, um, will you keep an
eye on Liam for me, please?

01:05:29.801 --> 01:05:32.137
- Of course. And same with Autumn?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:33.972
- Okay.
- Definitely.

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:36.433
Hey, why are you
drinking so much?

01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:40.061
Uh, I just... I get really
nervous at these social events

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:43.231
and I don't wanna end up in a
corner by myself like usual.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.191
Those days are gonzo.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:48.319
Totally. Okay. Come on.

01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:46.794
We have peppers, we have cheese!
It's nacho time!

01:06:55.053 --> 01:06:56.054
How did I not think I would--

01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:57.138
Mackenzie?

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.893
I am in desperate
need of a beverage

01:07:02.101 --> 01:07:03.686
and since you,
Mr. Liam,

01:07:03.895 --> 01:07:06.105
are on dry land,
you need to get me one.

01:07:06.314 --> 01:07:09.234
Oh, here. Do you want some of this?
It's like warm soup.

01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:12.028
Yes. Thank you, Claire!

01:07:13.613 --> 01:07:15.949
Are you scared of
the water, land lover?

01:07:16.157 --> 01:07:18.117
Oh, I didn't bring
my trunks or anything.

01:07:18.326 --> 01:07:20.995
Oh. Well, neither did we.

01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:39.180
- You're taking a long time to get in the
water. -l'm coming as fast as I can.

01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:42.141
Whoa!

01:07:43.768 --> 01:07:45.478
- Whoo!
- Ooh!

01:07:45.687 --> 01:07:47.438
Now it's a party!

01:07:47.647 --> 01:07:49.899
Um, did you see Autumn inside?

01:07:50.108 --> 01:07:52.986
Yeah, uh, she was
cleaning the sliding doors.

01:07:53.194 --> 01:07:54.737
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:56.281
- Liam!
- Mom!

01:07:56.489 --> 01:07:58.950
Honey! Where's your shirt?

01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:00.493
- Oh...
- You're gonna catch a cold.

01:08:00.702 --> 01:08:02.078
I'm gonna make you
some hot tea, okay?

01:08:02.287 --> 01:08:04.497
No, Mom. I'm okay, really.

01:08:04.706 --> 01:08:07.500
How can you be having fun if
you're cold and soaking wet?

01:08:07.709 --> 01:08:10.169
Mom, I was thinking about
maybe staying for the party.

01:08:10.378 --> 01:08:11.921
Okay, we can stay for a bit.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:14.007
No, I was thinking that
maybe you should go.

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:16.884
I get it.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:19.429
You wanna make out with a
girl, honey, you go for it.

01:08:19.636 --> 01:08:21.805
So many pretty ones here.
Okay, honey, bye!

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:24.642
- Bye. I love you.
- I love you.

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:28.729
Autumn, what happened
to your face?

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:32.442
There is red food coloring
in lip balm. I ate it all.

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:42.535
Hold on, okay?

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:48.416
911,
what's your emergency?

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:50.126
Hi, I have a noise complaint.

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:12.106
Hey, Maria.
Thanks for the invite.

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:21.616
What happened?

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:23.910
- You got punched in the face.
- Oh...

01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:26.412
I'm such a bad person.

01:09:26.621 --> 01:09:31.584
I'm a terrible mom. Autumn is so crazy.
She has no friends.

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:34.921
Look, I finished
my knitting cap.

01:09:35.129 --> 01:09:36.839
Oh.

01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:41.928
Oh, what am I doing?
Come on. Let's go.

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:50.435
Oh. That's my mom.

01:09:50.645 --> 01:09:52.313
- Oh, god.

01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:53.981
<i>Mom'?</i>

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:56.567
Liam! Liam Heap!

01:09:58.027 --> 01:09:58.695
Liam!

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:03.908
You get in the frigging car
right now! In the car!

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:07.954
Okay. Sorry. Sorry, Mom.

01:10:08.162 --> 01:10:09.122
Get in the car!

01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:13.084
You get in the car!

01:10:13.292 --> 01:10:15.169
Autumn,
get in the back seat!

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:16.462
You get in the back seat!

01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:17.672
In the front seat,
Mackenzie!

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.215
Autumn, get in
the backseat!

01:10:20.925 --> 01:10:21.884
Get in the car!

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:33.187
Slut.

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:36.691
I'm so sorry that I decided that I wanted
to take you to your first college party

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:38.443
and teach you how to get
drunk for the first time.

01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:39.944
Everything's a frigging
lesson with you!

01:10:40.153 --> 01:10:42.113
"Oh, Liam, this is how
you write a test, Liam."

01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:43.823
I don't. You make me
sound like a moron!

01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:45.616
"Yeah, Liam,
this is how you party.

01:10:45.825 --> 01:10:47.535
"Liam, this is how you drink,
this is how you have fun!"

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:49.203
You made out with Mackenzie!

01:10:49.412 --> 01:10:51.289
So what?

01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:52.832
She was really nice. What? Would
you rather I made out with you?

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.375
- Ugh.
- Hmm? Mom, what?

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:56.502
- Whoa!
- Come on. Show me the ropes, Mom.

01:10:56.711 --> 01:10:58.254
You know what? I'm sorry I just
tried to make the best for you.

01:10:58.463 --> 01:11:01.132
You're not! You want me
to be better, but I can't.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.384
I'm a loser. I don't even
wanna go to Cambridge.

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:05.678
Oh, you poor,
privileged white male!

01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:08.431
No, I wanna go become
a massage therapist!

01:11:08.639 --> 01:11:09.557
Don't you dare!

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:15.104
Liam? Liam!

01:11:22.153 --> 01:11:24.197
What the hell? Oh, my god!
What are you doing?

01:11:24.405 --> 01:11:26.282
- Another lesson, obviously!
- This is my door!

01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:28.743
You're out of control!

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:31.496
- Get that stupid shirt--
- Get out! Get out of here!

01:11:33.456 --> 01:11:37.710
Sometimes moms... Ow! You little shit!
Liam! Ow!

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:42.173
You are very, very...
Get over here.

01:11:43.508 --> 01:11:44.175
Ah!

01:11:47.011 --> 01:11:48.179
Did you just spank me?

01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:51.641
Yes.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:54.185
You had it coming.

01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:05.154
You know who won the
Pulitzer Prize this year?

01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:11.327
- Why?
- You don't. Do you?

01:12:11.536 --> 01:12:13.788
Who won the hurdles
in the Olympics?

01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:16.791
- Men's or females'?
- You don't know?

01:12:19.377 --> 01:12:22.046
Best in
the whole world

01:12:22.255 --> 01:12:24.757
and they haven't
affected you once.

01:12:24.966 --> 01:12:27.969
No Olympic hurdler's
ever affected anyone.

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:30.221
You know, Grandma's
not good at anything.

01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:32.139
She's not good at a thing.

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:35.434
And you told me
that she's affected you

01:12:35.643 --> 01:12:38.145
the most out of any person
in your whole life.

01:12:40.731 --> 01:12:42.859
I'm the only one
who knows that.

01:12:43.067 --> 01:12:44.443
I guess I wanna be
somebody like that.

01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:23.816
Huh?

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:33.367
Oh. Hi.

01:13:33.576 --> 01:13:36.454
Hey. I'm locked out.

01:13:36.662 --> 01:13:38.998
Uh, okay. I'll come
wait with you.

01:13:45.212 --> 01:13:46.297
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:13:48.883 --> 01:13:51.761
I'm not locked out. I just
wanted to see your face.

01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:52.720
Oh.

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:55.514
Ouch. Sorry about that.

01:13:55.723 --> 01:13:59.560
Yeah. Uh, it's okay.
My mom did some of it.

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:01.437
It's kinda been
one of those nights.

01:14:01.646 --> 01:14:02.897
Freezing my tits off.

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:04.440
My nipples are about to
rip through my shirt.

01:14:04.649 --> 01:14:05.775
Paughs]

01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:08.861
Um, do you wanna...

01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:11.030
- Wanna go inside?
- Yeah, sure.

01:14:17.495 --> 01:14:18.704
What happened in here?

01:14:18.913 --> 01:14:21.499
Oh. Uh... Shh.
We had this big party.

01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:27.046
Oh, um...

01:14:27.254 --> 01:14:30.883
Speaking of parties, Aisley's
throwing this big, uh, beach party

01:14:31.092 --> 01:14:34.095
like a funeral party
for Maria's resurrection.

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:36.430
It's kind of your party, too.

01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:39.225
Yeah. Yeah. I like...
I like parties.

01:14:40.434 --> 01:14:41.102
Okay.

01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:45.314
Hey, Anastasia.

01:14:45.523 --> 01:14:47.775
I'm really sorry that I put my name in
your boyfriend's phone number entry.

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:50.778
Good.

01:14:50.987 --> 01:14:53.155
You must have some pretty big balls
to pull off a stunt like that.

01:14:54.949 --> 01:14:55.992
No, I don't have balls.

01:14:57.493 --> 01:14:59.286
I do have balls.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:02.164
I don't have metaphorical
balls, but I do have testicles.

01:15:03.457 --> 01:15:04.166
Right.

01:15:10.965 --> 01:15:12.299
Human sex series?

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:14.593
Uh, that's a sex book
my mom gave me.

01:15:14.802 --> 01:15:16.137
She's teaching me
to be a badass.

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:22.059
These people look like
they're depressed.

01:15:24.645 --> 01:15:26.147
I'm pretty sure
whoever wrote this book

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:28.858
never had actual
enjoyable sex before.

01:15:29.066 --> 01:15:29.734
Yeah.

01:15:30.985 --> 01:15:31.736
What would that
even look like?

01:15:32.903 --> 01:15:35.489
Uh, something like this.

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:38.826
Ah!

01:15:44.123 --> 01:15:47.126
Why? What would... What would
your sex face look like?

01:15:47.334 --> 01:15:52.381
Oh, wow.

01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:55.843
I think
maybe the book's right.

01:15:56.052 --> 01:15:57.970
Is there anything your
mom doesn't teach you?

01:15:58.179 --> 01:16:00.181
No. No.

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:02.349
No, she's really thorough.

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:03.601
She's pretty much
my best friend.

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:18.199
Did your mom teach you
how to do that?

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:19.784
No.

01:16:21.327 --> 01:16:24.455
No. I usually
practice on my hand.

01:16:24.663 --> 01:16:27.124
That was way better. That was way better.

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:28.292
Oh, wow.

01:16:29.627 --> 01:16:32.963
Wow. That was pretty great.

01:16:33.172 --> 01:16:35.382
I think I'm gonna pass out.
Oh.

01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:44.850
Does this mean
we're together now?

01:16:45.059 --> 01:16:47.937
No, Liam,
we're just friends.

01:16:49.188 --> 01:16:50.564
Oh.

01:16:50.773 --> 01:16:53.317
Wow, my first girlfriend
and breakup in 30 seconds.

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:55.361
Friends who kissed.

01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:57.780
- Hmm.
- Twice.

01:17:01.325 --> 01:17:02.952
Oh.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.704
Some days, yeah,
you're the guy who picks A.

01:17:33.107 --> 01:17:35.776
Here we are again.
My last day at public school.

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:43.200
You can begin...

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:47.496
now.

01:17:55.713 --> 01:17:58.465
- Here we are.
- Here we are again.

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:00.634
Now the bell's
gonna ring soon.

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:03.345
Good to know.
Um, listen, I...

01:18:03.554 --> 01:18:05.055
I'm sorry I didn't
get back to you.

01:18:05.264 --> 01:18:07.766
I just, you know, I...
You are Liam's principal

01:18:07.975 --> 01:18:09.894
-and it felt-- - Yeah. No, I...
No, I know, I know.

01:18:10.102 --> 01:18:12.188
- No, just hold on one second. Just...
- It felt...

01:18:12.396 --> 01:18:15.107
- It felt inappropriate, could be
the word... - Just wait for it.

01:18:15.316 --> 01:18:18.110
-...because I... I...
- And...

01:18:20.446 --> 01:18:22.489
- You know your bells. flaughs]
- Oh, yeah, well...

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:24.825
That bell means
it's officially summer,

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:26.994
which means I'm no longer
you son's principal.

01:18:30.664 --> 01:18:33.459
- Oh!
- Hmm.

01:18:40.633 --> 01:18:44.136
Still 53 minutes left.
Wanna check anything over?

01:18:44.345 --> 01:18:45.095
Nope.

01:18:46.472 --> 01:18:47.223
Cocksucker.

01:18:48.766 --> 01:18:51.060
Wow, did you plan
that out?

01:18:51.268 --> 01:18:53.062
Actually, I did. Yeah.

01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:57.191
Uh, I saw you come in and I got
the secretary to ring the bell.

01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:59.860
It's 1:15. These kids
are confused. In get!

01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:02.279
The class is still going.
Guys! Guys!

01:19:02.488 --> 01:19:04.114
Class is still in.
That was a mistake.

01:19:04.323 --> 01:19:06.909
Martin. Martin? Martin?
Put your... Martin!

01:19:07.117 --> 01:19:10.162
Putyourphone back in your
pocket and get back into class.

01:19:22.216 --> 01:19:23.884
Go ahead. Open it.

01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:25.219
You already opened it.

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:26.470
You double-aced it.

01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:28.764
- I know.
- Oh!

01:19:28.973 --> 01:19:32.184
I can't wait to visit my little baby
in Cambridge. Sorry, little man.

01:19:32.393 --> 01:19:35.312
Why are you all dressed up? Are you going
out with that principal man again?

01:19:35.521 --> 01:19:37.106
No. Slash yes.

01:19:38.732 --> 01:19:40.526
What do you think when
I say the word "Trojan"?

01:19:40.734 --> 01:19:42.611
None of your business.

01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:43.737
But do you really
wanna know?

01:19:43.946 --> 01:19:44.863
No. No.

01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:54.123
- Yahoo!
- lt's beautiful!

01:19:54.331 --> 01:19:55.666
- Honey.
- Mmm.

01:19:55.874 --> 01:19:58.085
Try putting a hot dog stand
right next to a gym

01:19:58.294 --> 01:20:00.671
or an ice cream shop
next to a health food store.

01:20:00.879 --> 01:20:03.090
You see the key is to combine
torture with pleasure.

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:07.052
You know, I always
wanted a sister,

01:20:07.261 --> 01:20:09.430
but the only thing I got was Maria
here and I mean, he's terrible.

01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:12.725
You guys wanna make out?

01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:14.393
-L'm game.
-l'm game.

01:20:14.601 --> 01:20:15.644
Game.

01:20:23.986 --> 01:20:27.156
A little more of that.

01:20:27.364 --> 01:20:30.075
Some days, you don't end
up with the one-legged girl.

01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:40.544
You know why they first started
calling evening "evening"?

01:20:40.753 --> 01:20:42.338
No. No, I don't.

01:20:42.546 --> 01:20:45.007
Because it's the day
evening out with the night.

01:20:45.215 --> 01:20:46.133
Hmm.

01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:47.259
Not quite day,
not quite night.

01:20:47.468 --> 01:20:48.802
Right.
So the in-between time?

01:20:49.011 --> 01:20:50.804
- Yeah, interesting, right?
- Yeah, very interesting.

01:20:51.013 --> 01:20:52.973
Yeah, I never
thought of it that way.

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:55.976
Hey, you know, I really liked the
choices that you made for your classes,

01:20:56.185 --> 01:20:58.479
especially cultural club. You know,
I got kicked out of that one.

01:20:58.687 --> 01:21:00.481
Uh, yeah. I saw.

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:04.610
- L'm white.
- I noticed, yeah.

01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:07.237
I really liked
being Maria Sanchez.

01:21:07.446 --> 01:21:08.447
Yeah, I like
being Maria, too.

01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:11.283
I wonder what
it's like being you.

01:21:13.327 --> 01:21:14.745
Hi, I'm Liam Heap.

01:21:14.953 --> 01:21:16.789
Hi, Liam Heap.
Maria Sanchez.

01:21:16.997 --> 01:21:18.999
Well, it's nice to meet you.

01:21:20.793 --> 01:21:22.544
Some days,
you aren't Maria.

01:21:24.296 --> 01:21:25.464
- You got everything?
- Yes. Yes.

01:21:25.672 --> 01:21:27.049
Stop asking.

01:21:32.679 --> 01:21:34.223
All right!

01:21:36.934 --> 01:21:40.145
I got you one last thing.

01:21:40.354 --> 01:21:41.438
What?

01:21:41.647 --> 01:21:43.440
- To make some friends.
- No.

01:21:44.942 --> 01:21:46.777
That's awesome.

01:21:46.985 --> 01:21:48.946
All right, put your seatbelt on.
Let's get out of here.

01:21:49.154 --> 01:21:50.989
Some days,
you end up with your mom.

01:22:16.014 --> 01:22:17.224
I miss you already.

01:22:19.268 --> 01:22:20.436
I miss you, too.

01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:00.601
Hello, everyone.
Welcome to space.

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:01.435
Whoo!

01:23:02.686 --> 01:23:03.520
Gary McKeniz.

01:23:05.022 --> 01:23:05.856
Hmm. Emma Mitchell.

01:23:07.608 --> 01:23:09.693
- Lucy Quine.
- Here.

01:23:11.361 --> 01:23:12.279
Maria Sanchez.

01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:16.950
Maria Sanchez?

01:23:18.702 --> 01:23:20.579
Here. Sorry.

01:23:23.123 --> 01:23:24.666
Jennifer Stewart.

01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:29.922
Baker, Tom.

01:23:31.423 --> 01:23:32.466
Hi,

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:41.433
And some days,
