00:44.812 --> 00:48.482
HEY, SEE THAT GUY?

00:48.516 --> 00:49.676
HE JUST TURNED 30.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.817
- [laughs]
- WOW.

00:51.852 --> 00:52.822
- THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO LOOK LIKE

00:52.853 --> 00:54.393
IN A COUPLE DAYS,
MIKEY.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.792
- OH, DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE TEN.

00:56.824 --> 00:59.734
- YEAH, BUT THIS STRANGE THING
HAPPENS ON YOUR 30th.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.100
YOU LOOK GREAT
THE NIGHT BEFORE,

01:01.129 --> 01:02.299
BUT THEN YOU WAKE UP
THE NEXT MORNING,

01:02.330 --> 01:06.270
AND YOUR ASS IS DOWN TO THERE,
AND YOUR DICK DISAPPEARS.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.170
- WELL, I'M 33.
WHAT DOES THAT MAKE ME?

01:08.202 --> 01:11.172
- UH, DID YOU GUYS
JUST HEAR SOMETHING?

01:11.205 --> 01:13.305
LIKE A VOICE
FROM THE DEAD?

01:13.341 --> 01:15.181
- I'M GLAD I DIDN'T
MOVE IN WITH DAVID.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.179
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME
I HAVE LEFT.

01:17.211 --> 01:18.181
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

01:18.212 --> 01:20.282
- WELL, PERHAPS YOU WERE
LURED BY THE PROSPECT

01:20.314 --> 01:22.324
OF ALL THAT
CHIROPRACTIC SEX.

01:22.350 --> 01:25.550
- THE SEX
WASN'T THAT GREAT.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.786
- I SEEM TO REMEMBER SOMETHING
ABOUT A "TALENTED TONGUE."

01:28.822 --> 01:31.192
- YEAH, AND UH,
"FANTASTIC FINGERS".

01:31.225 --> 01:33.155
- ORGASMS THAT
WOULDN'T QUIT.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.864
- ALL RIGHT,
THE SEX WAS GREAT.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.125
IT'S JUST--

01:36.164 --> 01:37.004
IT GETS BORING,
YOU KNOW,

01:37.030 --> 01:38.730
WITH THE SAME PERSON,
AFTER A WHILE.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.866
- WELL, I WOULDN'T KNOW.

01:40.901 --> 01:42.471
- WELL, NOW I'M READY
TO DO ALL THOSE THINGS

01:42.503 --> 01:43.673
YOU CAN'T DO
WITH A BOYFRIEND,

01:43.704 --> 01:46.214
LIKE GO TO THE CLUBS,
AND GO OUT DANCING.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.810
- GO HOME ALONE.

01:47.841 --> 01:52.381
- HEY, BUSBOY!

01:52.413 --> 01:54.683
- [laughs]

01:54.715 --> 01:59.285
- DO YOU THINK
WE COULD GET SOME WATER?

01:59.320 --> 02:00.850
- [laughs]

02:00.888 --> 02:02.188
- WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?

02:02.223 --> 02:03.893
- ISN'T HE ADORABLE?

02:03.924 --> 02:05.734
THE CUSTOMERS LOVE HIM.

02:05.759 --> 02:08.329
HIS ASS GETS MORE COMPLIMENTS
THAN THE BURGERS.

02:08.362 --> 02:11.732
- 'CAUSE HIS BUNS
ARE FRESH.

02:11.765 --> 02:14.265
- JESUS.

02:14.302 --> 02:15.942
YOU LIVE IN MY ROOM
AT MY MOTHER'S HOUSE.

02:15.969 --> 02:16.939
YOU WORK WHERE I EAT.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.440
I CAN'T GET RID
OF YOU, CAN I?

02:18.472 --> 02:19.612
- BLAME HIM.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.610
HE'S THE ONE
WHO'S MAKING ME DO THIS.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.642
- HE'S JUST PAYING OFF
THE CHARGES HE MADE

02:23.677 --> 02:25.177
ON MY CREDIT CARD.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.283
- COULDN'T YOU SEND HIM
TO PRISON?

02:26.314 --> 02:28.654
- THIS IS WORSE.
- [chuckles]

02:28.682 --> 02:31.592
- [laughs]

02:31.619 --> 02:32.389
WHERE'S DAVID?

02:32.420 --> 02:36.560
- UM, I THINK
HE HAD A PATIENT.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.728
- DON'T BULLSHIT ME.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.300
- IT RAN ITS COURSE, DEB.
LEAVE IT ALONE.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.967
- OKAY.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.812
SO, EMMETT,

02:51.839 --> 02:53.209
HOW ABOUT THOSE
BLUEBERRY-BANANA PANCAKES

02:53.241 --> 02:54.211
YOU LOVE, HONEY?

02:54.242 --> 02:55.912
- OOH, YES.
YUM.

02:55.943 --> 02:59.783
UGH, WHY DID I EAT
THOSE GODDAMN PANCAKES?

02:59.813 --> 03:01.253
[burps]

03:01.282 --> 03:04.292
THEY'RE REPEATING MORE
THAN I LOVE LUCY.

03:04.318 --> 03:09.318
- I NEED TO GO REFILL
MY CLARITIN.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.417
HEY, DID YOU
SEE THAT GUY?

03:10.458 --> 03:13.328
- HONEY, MY GAYDAR WENT OFF
THE MINUTE HE WALKED IN.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.231
- I HAD SEX WITH HIM.

03:15.263 --> 03:16.763
- YOU DID NOT.
- DID TOO.

03:16.797 --> 03:17.997
- STOP IT.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.571
TELL ME EVERY DETAIL.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.740
- ALL RIGHT, IT WAS
SIX MONTHS AGO, AFTER WORK.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.639
I STOPPED OFF TO PICK UP SOME
BOTTLED WATER ON THE WAY HOME.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.641
THAT WAS BEFORE I STARTED
USING THE BRITA FILTER.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.913
- OKAY,
NOT EVERY DETAIL.

03:38.519 --> 03:42.689
- SORRY.
- NO PROBLEM.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.663
- DON'T WANT TO FACE THE MORNING
WITHOUT WATER.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.633
- OH, YEAH.

03:52.966 --> 03:55.936
[upbeat music]

03:55.969 --> 04:01.609
*

04:01.642 --> 04:03.842
- YEAH, YEAH, MM.

04:03.877 --> 04:07.577
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH.

04:07.615 --> 04:10.845
AND THAT'S THE STORY.

04:10.884 --> 04:13.894
- I NEED TO GO INTO
A PHONE BOOTH AND JERK OFF.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.021
- IT WAS LATE.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.385
I PROBABLY
LOOKED GOOD TO HIM

04:16.423 --> 04:17.863
'CAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE
HIS CONTACTS IN.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.731
- HONEY,
TAKE IT ANY WAY YOU CAN.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.899
- OH, I DID.

04:21.928 --> 04:22.899
- I'M STILL
ON THE CRIXIVAN,

04:22.930 --> 04:24.470
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM?

04:24.498 --> 04:25.698
- GOOD, YOU WON'T
HAVE ANY SIDE EFFECTS.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.343
- AND THEN
JUST TAKE TWO OF THESE?

04:27.368 --> 04:28.698
- HE MUST BE POSITIVE.

04:28.736 --> 04:29.566
THAT'S WHY
HE HAS SUCH A GOOD BODY.

04:29.603 --> 04:34.343
THEY PUT THEM ON STEROIDS,
YOU KNOW?

04:34.375 --> 04:35.575
WHAT?

04:35.609 --> 04:38.649
YOU WERE SAFE,
WEREN'T YOU?

04:48.756 --> 04:50.386
- MIKE?
WE NEED YOU IN THE BACK.

04:50.424 --> 04:51.794
THERE'S A FIRE.

04:51.825 --> 04:55.795
- A-A FIRE?
HOLY SHIT.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.003
WHERE'S THE FIRE?

05:04.037 --> 05:05.807
- OVER HERE!

05:05.839 --> 05:07.539
all: SURPRISE!

05:07.575 --> 05:09.835
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.547
- YOU GUYS,
HOW DID YOU--

05:11.579 --> 05:12.549
- TRACY FOUND OUT.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.720
SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOU.

05:14.748 --> 05:15.718
- UH, REALLY?

05:15.749 --> 05:17.389
- NOT EVERYTHING.

05:17.418 --> 05:21.048
MAKE A WISH.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.088
[applause]

05:23.123 --> 05:25.093
- YOU'RE AN OLD MAN NOW.

05:25.125 --> 05:29.895
[indistinct chatter]

05:29.930 --> 05:32.130
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MIKE.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.725
[cheers]

05:33.767 --> 05:36.937
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MIKE.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.141
- [sighs]

05:40.173 --> 05:41.943
- THEY THREW A PARTY FOR ME
AT WORK TODAY.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.375
- AWW.

05:43.411 --> 05:44.681
THAT'S CUTE.

05:44.712 --> 05:47.052
- RIGHT, LIKE THAT'S
SUPPOSED TO MAKE ME HAPPY,

05:47.080 --> 05:52.050
KNOWING THAT ALL MY BEST YEARS
ARE BEHIND ME.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.985
YOU'RE NOT PLANNING SOME
HIDEOUS BIRTHDAY SURPRISE,

05:54.021 --> 05:56.091
ARE YOU?

05:56.123 --> 05:59.133
- WHY WOULD I WANT TO CELEBRATE
A TRAGIC EVENT LIKE THAT?

05:59.159 --> 06:00.859
- GOOD, 'CAUSE I WANT
THAT DAY TO PASS

06:00.894 --> 06:02.604
WITHOUT A SINGLE REMINDER

06:02.630 --> 06:08.600
THAT I'LL NEVER
BE YOUNG AND CUTE AGAIN.

06:08.636 --> 06:10.666
- WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE
KEPT THE GOOD DOCTOR AROUND.

06:10.704 --> 06:11.714
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE YOUNGER
THAN HIM.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.009
AND CUTER.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.610
- I THOUGHT YOU
COULDN'T STAND HIM.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.012
- WHEN DID I EVER
SAY THAT?

06:16.043 --> 06:17.613
- EVERY CHANCE YOU GOT.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.145
- MAYBE HE WASN'T
SUCH A BAD GUY AFTER ALL.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.879
- WELL, NOW'S A HELL OF A TIME
TO TELL ME.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.775
- WHY? YOU DIDN'T BREAK UP WITH
HIM ON ACCOUNT OF ME, DID YOU?

06:23.817 --> 06:25.017
- COURSE NOT.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.922
- THAT'S GOOD.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.824
'CAUSE WE CAN'T SPEND
THE REST OF OUR FUCKING LIVES

06:28.856 --> 06:31.586
HANGING OUT TOGETHER.

06:50.110 --> 06:54.080
- HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?
HOW COULD YOU JUST LAPSE?

06:55.549 --> 06:57.149
- I WASN'T THINKING.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.854
THERE WAS NO TIME TO THINK.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.786
- WELL, THAT'S NO EXCUSE.

07:00.821 --> 07:04.021
I ALWAYS HAVE A CONDOM,
SPERMICIDAL LUBRICANT--

07:04.057 --> 07:06.087
- A BOTTLE OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE
AND WITCH HAZEL, GREAT.

07:06.126 --> 07:07.796
SO YOU'RE THE SAFE-SEX
POSTER BOY

07:07.828 --> 07:08.998
AND I'M THE HAPPY HOOKER.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.729
- I'M JUST SAYING,
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.204
- ALL RIGHT, ALREADY.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.902
- I'M SERIOUS.

07:13.934 --> 07:17.814
IF ANYTHING EVER HAPPENED
TO YOU...

07:17.838 --> 07:21.478
YOU'RE TOO IMPORTANT TO ME.

07:23.611 --> 07:27.681
- THANKS, EM.

07:27.715 --> 07:30.945
- OKAY, LET'S ROLL UP
THOSE SLEEVES.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.794
- HI.

07:32.820 --> 07:36.520
- HI.

07:36.557 --> 07:37.957
YOU'RE NOT A REGULAR PATIENT
HERE, ARE YOU?

07:37.991 --> 07:40.831
- HE'S NOT A REGULAR
ANYTHING.

07:40.861 --> 07:43.131
- I'M JUST GETTING TESTED
FOR MORAL SUPPORT.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.973
I-I MAKE A POINT OF GETTING
TESTED EVERY SIX MONTHS.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.838
I'M SILLY, REALLY,
'CAUSE MOST OF MY SEX IS CYBER.

07:47.868 --> 07:50.798
OW! OW!

07:53.641 --> 07:55.911
- WHAT'S YOUR INSURANCE
SITUATION?

07:55.943 --> 07:58.783
- UM, I'LL PAY BY CHECK.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.652
ADDRESS, PHONE NUMBER,
RIGHT ON TOP.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.592
- CAN WE JUST DO THIS?
- HE'S NERVOUS.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.627
- I'M SURE
YOU'LL BE FINE.

08:15.663 --> 08:16.633
- THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HIM.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.967
- OKAY.
WE'RE ALL DONE.

08:26.006 --> 08:26.966
AND NOW--

08:27.007 --> 08:29.007
- WE WAIT.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.754
- SUNSHINE.
- HMM?

08:35.783 --> 08:37.893
- HERE, TAKE THESE ON UP
TO YOUR ROOM.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.888
- OKEY-DOKE.
- MY ROOM.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.721
- COME ON, SWEETIE.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.056
BACK OFF, HUH?

08:44.091 --> 08:45.761
YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE
30 YEARS OLD.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.193
- SO OLD.

08:47.227 --> 08:52.097
- DON'T REMIND ME.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.942
- WHAT ARE THOSE?
- HIS MEDS.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.698
- I THOUGHT
YOU JUST GOT SOME.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.307
- THOSE LITTLE BOTTLES
DON'T GO FAR

08:58.338 --> 09:00.968
WHEN YOU'RE POPPING
50 PILLS A DAY.

09:01.008 --> 09:04.038
- YOU'RE ON YOUR
LAST REFILL.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.647
- I'LL CALL THE DOCTOR.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.049
- SPEAKING OF DOCTORS--

09:07.080 --> 09:08.920
- THAT'S A SUBTLE SEGUE.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.319
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO DISCUSS THIS.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.690
IT DOESN'T CONCERN YOU.

09:11.719 --> 09:12.519
- OH, NO?

09:12.552 --> 09:14.222
I JUST LOST A POTENTIAL
SON-IN-LAW.

09:14.254 --> 09:17.664
- ALL YOU LOST WAS FREE
TREATMENT FOR OSTEOPOROSIS.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.661
- MICHAEL CHARLES NOVOTNY.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.663
- UH-OH, MIDDLE NAME,
LOOK OUT.

09:21.695 --> 09:24.295
- YOU LISTEN TO ME,
AND YOU LISTEN CAREFULLY.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.671
DO NOT FUCK THIS UP.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.370
NOW, I WANT YOU
TO CALL DAVID RIGHT NOW

09:28.401 --> 09:31.741
AND APOLOGIZE TO HIM
FOR WHATEVER IT IS YOU DID.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.212
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I DID ANYTHING?

09:33.240 --> 09:34.140
- I'M YOUR MOTHER.

09:34.174 --> 09:37.984
- MOM, DAVID AND I
HAD NOTHING IN COMMON

09:38.011 --> 09:40.251
EXCEPT PANTENE SHAMPOO
AND CONDITIONER IN ONE,

09:40.280 --> 09:42.880
AND I HAD TO GIVE UP
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

09:42.916 --> 09:43.946
I COULDN'T SEE MY FRIENDS.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.954
I COULDN'T GO TO CLUBS.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.146
- GOOD.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.817
GET OUT
BEFORE THEY KICK YOU OUT,

09:48.856 --> 09:50.316
BEFORE YOU TURN INVISIBLE.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.927
- SEE?
LISTEN TO YOUR UNCLE.

09:51.959 --> 09:55.229
HUH, YOU WANT
TO BE LIKE HIM?

09:55.262 --> 09:57.232
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

09:57.264 --> 10:00.034
IN A FEW DAYS, YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BE A KID ANYMORE,

10:00.067 --> 10:01.197
HANGING OUT WITH BRIAN.

10:01.234 --> 10:04.914
- WHY IS IT ALWAYS BRIAN?
- YOU TELL ME.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.708
I MEAN, DAVID
REALLY CARED FOR YOU.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.711
YOU COULD SEE IT
IN HIS EYES.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.383
HUH, VIC,
COULDN'T YOU?

10:11.411 --> 10:13.811
- I DON'T KNOW, I WAS TOO BUSY
LOOKING AT HIS CHEST.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.377
- THERE'LL BE SOMEONE ELSE.

10:15.415 --> 10:18.245
- THERE'LL ALWAYS BE
SOMEONE ELSE.

10:18.285 --> 10:22.885
BUT THERE WON'T BE
SOMEONE LIKE DAVID EVERY DAY.

10:33.734 --> 10:39.274
[phone ringing]

10:39.306 --> 10:43.276
- HELLO?
HELLO?

10:44.978 --> 10:46.078
MICHAEL?

10:46.113 --> 10:47.753
I HAVE CALLER I.D.

10:47.781 --> 10:51.321
- I-I MUST HAVE
PUSHED THE WRONG BUTTON.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.793
[phone beeps]

11:01.161 --> 11:04.201
- YOU'VE RUINED
MY KID'S LIFE.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.331
- WHAT, NO HELLO KISS?

11:05.365 --> 11:07.065
- I MEAN IT.

11:07.100 --> 11:10.940
YOU GOT SOMETHING FIZZY?

11:10.971 --> 11:14.171
I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME
I HEARD YOUR NAME.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.837
MICHAEL SAYS,
"THERE'S THIS NEW BOY IN SCHOOL,

11:16.877 --> 11:18.777
BRIAN KINNEY."

11:18.812 --> 11:20.452
FOR WEEKS, THAT'S ALL
HE COULD TALK ABOUT.

11:20.480 --> 11:23.780
BRIAN KINNEY THIS
AND BRIAN KINNEY THAT.

11:23.817 --> 11:27.187
NEXT THING,
YOU'RE CUTTING CLASSES.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.490
AND THEN I COME HOME
FROM WORK ONE DAY,

11:28.521 --> 11:32.491
AND I FIND THE TWO OF YOU,
14 AND DRUNK.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.255
IT WAS THEN
I KNEW YOU WERE TROUBLE,

11:35.295 --> 11:38.925
AND YOU HAVEN'T DISAPPOINTED ME
A DAY SINCE THEN.

11:38.966 --> 11:39.926
- WELL, AT LEAST
YOU CAN'T ACCUSE ME

11:39.967 --> 11:42.467
OF BEING INCONSISTENT.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.072
- CONSISTENT HEARTBREAK.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.074
- COME ON, DEB,

11:45.105 --> 11:46.435
YOU KNOW
I'VE LOOKED AFTER MIKEY.

11:46.473 --> 11:49.313
- I NEVER SAID THAT YOU
WEREN'T THERE FOR HIM.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.312
YOU'VE BEEN THERE
TOO MUCH.

11:51.344 --> 11:54.054
ALWAYS GIVING HIM JUST
THOSE EXTRA LITTLE TIDBITS

11:54.081 --> 11:56.051
OF YOUR AFFECTION, HUH?

11:56.083 --> 11:59.093
TO MAKE HIM BELIEVE THAT
MAYBE SOMEDAY YOU'D BE HIS.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.849
- WELL, WHO KNOWS?

12:00.888 --> 12:03.958
MAYBE WE'LL END UP A COUPLE
OF OLD QUEENS IN PALM SPRINGS.

12:03.991 --> 12:07.361
- ONLY WHAT'S HE
SUPPOSED TO DO UNTIL THEN?

12:07.394 --> 12:09.764
HE HAD A CHANCE
WITH DAVID,

12:09.797 --> 12:11.497
BUT YOU HAD TO FUCK IT UP.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.271
- HE WASN'T HAVING ANY FUN.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.940
- HE'S HAD ENOUGH FUN.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.138
YOU'VE ALL HAD ENOUGH FUN.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.410
IT'S TIME FOR HIM
TO BE A MAN.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.239
- AND WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO ABOUT THAT?

12:21.274 --> 12:25.214
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETHING.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.215
YOU OWE MY KID SOMETHING.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.378
- OKAY, YOU WIN.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.858
I'LL DO SOMETHING.

12:34.888 --> 12:39.428
IT'S MIKEY'S 30th BIRTHDAY.

12:39.459 --> 12:43.359
HE SHOULD HAVE A PARTY
HE NEVER FORGETS.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.470
- WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS?

12:54.507 --> 12:56.537
IT LIFTS AND SEPARATES.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.546
- SOUNDS LIKE THE
"I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S A BRA."

12:58.578 --> 13:00.448
- HMM, SAME PRINCIPLE.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.820
IT'S THE "I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S A HARNESS".

13:02.850 --> 13:04.450
- YEAH, SOMEHOW,
I CAN'T SEE MICHAEL

13:04.484 --> 13:06.424
TRUSSED UP LIKE A TURKEY.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.293
- SO THEN
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

13:08.321 --> 13:11.091
- HE'S ONE
OF MY BEST FRIENDS.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.894
I CAN'T LET
HIS 30th BIRTHDAY GO BY

13:12.926 --> 13:15.056
WITHOUT GETTING HIM SOMETHING
CHEAP AND DEMEANING.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.595
- HOW ABOUT
SOME BEN WA BALLS?

13:16.629 --> 13:20.799
- WELL, HE IS A BIT
OF A TIGHT-ASS.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.342
I WONDER WHAT BRIAN'LL
GET HIM.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.442
- IF HE'S LUCKY,
A FAREWELL FUCK,

13:27.474 --> 13:28.884
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.179
- NICE.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.410
- WELL, IT IS
SOMETHING HE WANTS

13:31.444 --> 13:37.284
AND WOULDN'T GET
FOR HIMSELF.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.287
[vibrator buzzing]

13:39.319 --> 13:42.189
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS?

13:42.222 --> 13:42.992
- I THINK HE ALREADY
HAS ONE.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.493
- NO, I MEAN
FOR LINDSAY AND ME.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.234
- OH, SORRY,
NOT MY AREA.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.059
- IT HASN'T
BEEN MINE EITHER, LATELY.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.395
- WELL, GIVE IT TIME.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.529
YOU KNOW,
AFTER A WOMAN GIVES BIRTH,

13:50.563 --> 13:53.033
IT TAKES SEVERAL MONTHS
BEFORE SHE FEELS SEXUAL AGAIN.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.896
- OH, GOD, I WISH YOU'D
STOP READING REDBOOK.

13:54.935 --> 13:58.165
- HMM, MCCALL'S.
I LIKE THE SEX TIPS BETTER.

13:58.205 --> 14:00.065
DID YOU KNOW THERE'S TEN WAYS
TO PLEASE A MAN

14:00.107 --> 14:01.537
WITHOUT OPENING YOUR MOUTH?

14:01.574 --> 14:06.354
HMM, GO FIGURE.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.579
- IT'S NOT JUST THE SEX.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.224
I FEEL LIKE
SHE'S SHUTTING ME OUT.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.919
I JUST--I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH LONGER I CAN TAKE IT.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.192
- LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR THIS.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.190
- WHY CAN'T I SHARE?

14:14.221 --> 14:15.261
- BECAUSE THE MINUTE
YOU START

14:15.288 --> 14:17.118
TELLING YOUR FRIENDS
YOUR RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS,

14:17.157 --> 14:18.587
IT'S THE BEGINNING
OF THE END.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.955
FIND A SHRINK.

14:19.993 --> 14:22.063
- OY, I'VE BEEN IN THERAPY
FOR SIX YEARS.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.195
- ARE YOU COVERED
BY INSURANCE?

14:23.230 --> 14:24.360
- YUP.
- GREAT.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.097
THEN HAVE A BREAKDOWN.
YOU CAN AFFORD IT.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.133
- JESUS,
WHAT IS WITH YOU?

14:27.167 --> 14:28.667
YOU ARE SO NEGATIVE.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.471
- FROM YOUR LIPS
TO GOD'S EARS.

14:30.503 --> 14:34.513
[cell phone ringing]

14:34.541 --> 14:37.111
- IT'S ME.

14:37.144 --> 14:38.514
HELLO?

14:38.545 --> 14:41.105
- HEY, TED, IT'S STEVE,
FROM DR. ROTH'S OFFICE.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.278
UM, YOUR RESULTS ARE IN.

14:43.316 --> 14:46.316
- WELL, THAT--
THAT WAS FAST.

14:46.353 --> 14:51.023
UH, SO DO YOU, UH,
DO YOU WANT ME TO COME IN?

14:51.058 --> 14:54.688
- NOPE, NO NEED TO.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.297
- THANKS.
[phone beeps]

15:02.135 --> 15:05.305
I'M NEGATIVE.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.981
I'M NEGATIVE.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.283
- WELL, THAT'S OKAY.

15:14.314 --> 15:17.254
HAPPY PEOPLE CAN
BE REALLY ANNOYING.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.730
- OKAY, WE'VE GOT TO PREPARE
OUR STORIES FOR MICHAEL.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.358
I DON'T TRUST YOU
TO THINK ON THE SPOT.

15:28.395 --> 15:31.125
- YOU ALWAYS ASSUME THE WORST.
YOU'RE SO NEGATIVE.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.034
- HMM, FUNNY.

15:33.066 --> 15:37.496
THAT'S WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID.

15:37.537 --> 15:38.737
- YOU HEARD?

15:38.771 --> 15:42.281
OH, TED, OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S FABULOUS.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.539
NOW, I HOPE YOU'VE
LEARNED YOUR LESSON.

15:43.576 --> 15:44.636
- YES, MOTHER.

15:44.677 --> 15:49.477
- OH, MY GOD, LET ME SHOW YOU
WHAT I GOT MICHAEL.

15:49.516 --> 15:53.046
ONE VINTAGE EASY-CAKE OVEN.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.216
- WHY'D YOU GET HIM THAT?

15:54.254 --> 15:56.624
- EVERY GAY BOY WANTED
AN EASY-CAKE OVEN.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.256
- UH-HUH.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.291
- DIDN'T YOU?

15:59.326 --> 16:00.686
- UH-UH.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.157
SO, DID THEY CALL YOU?

16:02.195 --> 16:04.525
- OH, I HAVEN'T
CHECKED MY MESSAGES YET.

16:12.105 --> 16:16.605
STEVE, CUTIE
FROM DR. ROTH'S OFFICE.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.375
HE WANTS ME TO--

16:20.413 --> 16:23.383
- [scoffs]
WHAT?

16:25.752 --> 16:26.692
WHAT?

16:26.719 --> 16:30.519
- HE WANTS ME TO COME IN
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.757
- WELL, I'M SURE IT CAN'T MEAN
WHAT YOU THINK IT MEANS,

16:32.792 --> 16:35.132
BECAUSE YOU SAID YOURSELF,
YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.632
- ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS ONE THING.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.233
- I'M SURE
YOU'RE FINE, EMMETT.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.725
- THEN WHY
DIDN'T HE SAY THAT?

16:39.766 --> 16:43.096
- IT'S PROBABLY--IT'S
PROCEDURE WITH NEW PATIENTS.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.696
- BULLSHIT, EVERYBODY KNOWS
WHEN THEY TELL YOU TO COME IN,

16:44.737 --> 16:47.807
IT MEANS SOMETHING'S WRONG.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.440
FUCK.

16:49.476 --> 16:50.706
THE OFFICE IS CLOSED
FOR THE WEEKEND.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.783
I HAVE TO WAIT--
I HAVE TO WAIT TILL MONDAY.

16:52.812 --> 16:53.782
I HAVE TO WAIT
TILL FUCKING MONDAY?

16:53.813 --> 16:55.223
THE WHOLE FUCKING WEEKEND?

16:55.248 --> 16:57.518
- OKAY, SO WE JUST--
WE'LL REMAIN CALM, AND--

16:57.550 --> 17:01.250
- OH MY GOD.
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME?

17:01.288 --> 17:04.458
- OR THIS IS GOOD, TOO.

17:11.830 --> 17:13.771
- HEY, DOC.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.540
YOU GOT ALL SWEATY
WITHOUT ME.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.198
- WELL,
I WENT FOR A JOG.

17:17.237 --> 17:18.037
- YEAH,
I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS

17:18.070 --> 17:19.840
TO STAY IN SHAPE
AFTER A CERTAIN AGE.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.541
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T
COME ALL THE WAY OUT HERE

17:21.574 --> 17:23.214
JUST TO INSULT ME,

17:23.242 --> 17:25.413
AND WE'RE NOT BATTLING OVER
MICHAEL'S ATTENTION ANY MORE.

17:25.444 --> 17:28.645
YOU WON.
SO WHY ARE YOU HERE?

17:28.681 --> 17:31.621
- YOU FORGOT TO RSVP.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.351
YOU KNOW, THE SURPRISE PARTY.
I CALLED AND LEFT A MESSAGE.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.357
- OH, YEAH, WELL,
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A JOKE.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.229
- WHY WOULD IT BE A JOKE?

17:38.258 --> 17:40.428
- LOOK, I DON'T THINK MICHAEL
WOULD FEEL TOO COMFORTABLE

17:40.460 --> 17:42.130
WITH ME BEING THERE,
AND, QUITE FRANKLY,

17:42.162 --> 17:44.632
I DON'T THINK I'D FEEL TOO
COMFORTABLE BEING THERE MYSELF.

17:44.664 --> 17:47.604
- DOC, YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME
AT MY PLACE.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.244
- THANKS, BUT NO THANKS.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.299
- COME ON.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.267
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE UP
THAT EASY, ARE YOU?

17:52.305 --> 17:55.375
- HEY, I DIDN'T GIVE UP.
THAT WAS HIS DECISION.

17:55.408 --> 17:58.448
- WELL, MIKEY DOESN'T ALWAYS
KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR HIM.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.708
- NO SHIT.

18:00.747 --> 18:04.317
- SOMETIMES HE NEEDS
A LITTLE PUSH.

18:05.818 --> 18:09.418
SO YOU'LL COME BY AROUND,
UH, 9:00?

18:13.760 --> 18:16.200
- I'VE NEVER BEEN
TO PARIS.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.899
I ALWAYS WANTED
TO SEE PARIS.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.530
- YOU'LL STILL GET THERE.

18:20.567 --> 18:21.867
EVEN IF YOU'RE POSITIVE,
IT DOESN'T MEAN

18:21.901 --> 18:23.441
YOU'RE GOING
TO DROP DEAD TOMORROW.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.870
- OH, MY GOD,
YOU SAID IT.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.635
YOU SAID IT,
"YOU'RE--YOU'RE POSITIVE".

18:27.674 --> 18:32.754
- I SAID, "EVEN IF..." TO IMPLY
THE LACK OF PLAUSIBILITY.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.879
- I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
THAT GUY IN P-TOWN.

18:34.914 --> 18:37.354
HE KEPT BITING MY LIP.

18:37.384 --> 18:39.224
OR MAYBE THAT GUY
IN THE DRESSING ROOM

18:39.252 --> 18:41.722
WHO KEPT STICKING HIS FINGERS
IN MY MOUTH.

18:41.754 --> 18:42.564
OR SOME GUY AT THE GYM.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.589
- I THOUGHT
YOU NEVER DID ANYTHING.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.464
- I KNOW GUYS WHO FUCK
A HUNDRED TIMES A WEEK.

18:47.494 --> 18:50.464
FIVE OR SIX TIMES
ISN'T ANYTHING.

18:50.497 --> 18:53.667
- EMMETT,
YOU CANNOT BE INFECTED.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.870
NO ONE IN THE WORLD IS MORE
HIV-PHOBIC THAN YOU ARE.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.342
YOU PRACTICALLY
BOIL THE SHEETS.

18:58.371 --> 19:01.641
- WELL, THAT STILL DOESN'T
EXPLAIN WHY THEY WANT TO SEE ME,

19:01.674 --> 19:05.654
NOW DOES IT?

19:05.678 --> 19:09.648
GOD, HOW THE FUCK AM I GOING
TO GET THROUGH THIS WEEKEND?

19:17.957 --> 19:20.587
OH, TED.

19:20.627 --> 19:26.497
I AM SO SCARED.

19:26.533 --> 19:29.443
- COME ON.

19:29.469 --> 19:32.269
OKAY.

19:35.475 --> 19:38.675
LOOK, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SKIP MICHAEL'S PARTY.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.411
- NO.
NO.

19:40.447 --> 19:43.677
I DON'T WANT
TO SPOIL HIS DAY.

19:43.716 --> 19:44.946
- ARE YOU SURE?

19:44.984 --> 19:45.994
- YEAH, YEAH.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.258
IT'LL TAKE MY MIND
OFF THINGS.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.958
WE JUST CAN'T TELL HIM.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.490
- OKAY.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.485
RIGHT, REMEMBER.

19:53.526 --> 19:57.796
STORY IS WE'RE PICKING UP BRIAN
TO GO FOR DINNER

19:57.830 --> 19:59.000
AND TO BABYLON.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.971
- RIGHT.
ONE LAST DANCE OF DEATH.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.700
- EMMETT.

20:04.737 --> 20:07.307
- HEY, HEY.
- HEY, HEY, BIRTHDAY BOY.

20:07.340 --> 20:08.310
- FUCK YOU,
I'M GOING TO BED.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.611
- YOU CAN'T.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.842
YOU KNOW, WE'RE--
WE'RE GOING TO PICK UP BRIAN

20:11.878 --> 20:13.378
TO GO DO DINNER
AND BABYLON.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.953
- I DON'T WANT
TO SEE ANYBODY.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.381
- NOW, NOW, MR. GRUMPYPUSS.
WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.417
DON'T YOU
WANT TO GO OUT?

20:18.451 --> 20:19.591
- NO, I DON'T WANT
TO GO OUT.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.889
- HEY, THIS IS A VERY
SPECIAL OCCASION.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.891
YOU KNOW, ONCE IN A LIFETIME
THING, A NIGHT OF NIGHTS.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.593
- YEAH, WELL I PLAN
ON SLEEPING THROUGH

20:25.625 --> 20:26.985
EVERY MISERABLE MINUTE
OF IT.

20:27.026 --> 20:29.596
YOU GUYS CAN TELL ME
ALL ABOUT IT TOMORROW.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.659
- WE NEED TO CELEBRATE.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.568
- CELEBRATE WHAT?
THAT I'M TURNING INTO A GEEZER?

20:33.600 --> 20:34.900
THAT MY LIFE IS OVER?

20:34.934 --> 20:37.974
- THINK OF ALL YOU HAVE
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

20:38.004 --> 20:41.644
- FLATULENCE, INCONTINENCE, UH,
CHRONIC CONSTIPATION,

20:41.674 --> 20:43.044
A CLOSET FULL OF DEPENDS--

20:43.075 --> 20:44.935
- OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!

20:44.977 --> 20:46.407
WOULD YOU SHUT UP ALREADY

20:46.446 --> 20:49.676
AND COME TO YOUR GODDAMN
SURPRISE PARTY?

20:59.025 --> 21:01.825
- SURPRISE.

21:01.861 --> 21:05.501
- HI, WE'RE HERE.
WE'RE READY TO GO TO BABYLON.

21:05.532 --> 21:08.772
- ASSHOLES.

21:08.801 --> 21:11.741
YOU TOLD HIM.

21:16.343 --> 21:19.053
all: SURPRISE!

21:19.078 --> 21:20.378
- OH, MY GOD!

21:20.413 --> 21:22.753
[cheering]

21:22.782 --> 21:25.822
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MIKEY!

21:25.852 --> 21:27.692
- WHO ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE?

21:27.720 --> 21:29.660
- WELL, IF I INVITED
JUST YOUR FRIENDS,

21:29.689 --> 21:31.759
THERE WOULD BE, LIKE,
SIX PEOPLE HERE.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.791
I HAD TO OPEN IT UP
TO SEX PARTNERS.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.627
- I HAVEN'T SLEPT WITH ANY
OF THESE PEOPLE.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.373
- MY SEX PARTNERS.
- OH. [laughs]

21:38.398 --> 21:43.038
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MIKEY.

21:43.069 --> 21:45.469
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MICHAEL.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.505
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MICHAEL.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.740
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
SWEETHEART.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.706
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MICHAEL.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.454
- THANKS, UNCLE VIC.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.850
- EXACTLY 30 YEARS AGO,
MY LEGS WERE IN STIRRUPS

21:56.883 --> 21:58.083
AND MY FACE
LOOKED LIKE THIS.

21:58.117 --> 22:03.557
[screams]

22:03.590 --> 22:05.990
- WOW, THIS REALLY IS
A SURPRISE PARTY.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.395
- HI.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.498
HERE.

22:10.530 --> 22:11.500
30, HUH?

22:11.531 --> 22:12.431
- YEAH.

22:12.465 --> 22:13.895
- WELL, I HOPE I LOOK
AS GOOD AS YOU DO

22:13.933 --> 22:16.443
WHEN I'M YOUR AGE.
- GIVE ME YOUR JACKET.

22:16.469 --> 22:19.409
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.775
- COME ON, MIKEY.
YOU'VE GOT PRESENTS.

22:24.811 --> 22:28.751
EXCUSE US.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.781
- MARGARITA, NO SALT.

22:30.817 --> 22:33.717
- RIGHT UP.

22:33.753 --> 22:36.123
- HEY, HOW DO YOU KNOW
HOW TO MIX DRINKS?

22:36.155 --> 22:40.385
- I'M FROM THE GENTILE
COUNTRY CLUB SET.

22:40.427 --> 22:42.597
- OKAY, EVERYBODY,
IT'S TIME.

22:42.629 --> 22:46.569
MIKEY'S GOING
TO OPEN HIS PRESENTS.

22:51.871 --> 22:55.011
- UM...

22:55.041 --> 22:57.011
OH, MY GOD.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.013
AN EASY-CAKE OVEN.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.945
I ALWAYS WANTED
ONE OF THOSE.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.620
- AWW.

23:02.649 --> 23:05.789
- THANKS, EM,
I LOVE IT.

23:05.818 --> 23:08.958
- AWW.
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.488
- UH...

23:11.524 --> 23:12.664
- OH, THAT'S MINE.

23:12.692 --> 23:13.662
[laughs]

23:13.693 --> 23:16.603
OPEN IT.
OPEN IT.

23:22.068 --> 23:25.168
YOU PUT YOUR DICK
WHERE THE TRUNK GOES.

23:25.204 --> 23:29.984
[laughing]

23:30.009 --> 23:31.039
IT'S FUNNY.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.877
- IT IS.
IT'S FUNNY.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.612
- MOVING ON.

23:34.647 --> 23:37.517
- OKAY, HONEY.
- WHATEVER.

23:37.550 --> 23:40.190
- UH, WHO'S THIS ONE FROM?

23:40.219 --> 23:41.919
- OH, THAT'S--
THAT'S FROM ME.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.174
- WOW.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.699
THIS IS--
THIS IS REALLY--

23:55.735 --> 23:57.195
- EXPENSIVE.

23:57.236 --> 23:59.136
- UH, WELL,
I HAD IT INSCRIBED BEFORE,

23:59.171 --> 24:01.641
BUT DON'T PAY ATTENTION
TO THE WORDS.

24:01.674 --> 24:05.554
JUST, UH, FOCUS
ON THE WATERPROOF FEATURES.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.621
- THANK YOU, DAVID.

24:10.650 --> 24:11.680
- SURE.

24:11.718 --> 24:13.518
- HEY, MIKEY.

24:13.553 --> 24:17.263
THERE'S SOMEONE HERE
TO SEE YOU.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.989
[laughter]

24:20.026 --> 24:21.186
- HELLO, MICHAEL.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.497
I HEARD
IT WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY,

24:22.529 --> 24:23.699
SO I THOUGHT I'D FLY BY

24:23.730 --> 24:25.930
AND BRING YOU
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

24:25.965 --> 24:30.035
- OH, MY GOD,
CAPTAIN ASTRO.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.099
ASTRO COMICS NUMBER ONE?

24:32.138 --> 24:36.078
THIS IS THE FIRST APPEARANCE
OF CAPTAIN ASTRO IN PRINT.

24:36.108 --> 24:37.738
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
THIS IS WORTH?

24:37.777 --> 24:40.747
- ANYTHING
FOR MY BEST FRIEND.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.080
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

24:43.115 --> 24:48.515
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D FIND THIS.

24:48.555 --> 24:50.855
- SO, CAP,
DON'T FLY AWAY.

24:50.890 --> 24:56.830
STAY AND BOOGIE
WITH THE BIRTHDAY BOY.

24:56.863 --> 24:59.833
ENJOY, MIKEY.

24:59.866 --> 25:02.866
[dance music]

25:02.902 --> 25:10.882
*

25:15.047 --> 25:17.317
- IT'S A BEAUTIFUL WATCH,
DAVID.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.889
AND A BEAUTIFUL THOUGHT.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.949
- THANKS.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.036
- HEY, NICE GOING
ON THE GIFT.

26:09.068 --> 26:13.308
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
MORE PERFECT.

26:13.339 --> 26:14.769
- THANKS.

26:14.807 --> 26:18.807
- YEAH, DAVID'S PRESENT
DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

26:18.845 --> 26:21.705
AND THEN AGAIN,
NEITHER DID HE.

26:21.748 --> 26:23.348
- FUCK OFF.

26:23.382 --> 26:26.152
- YOU JUST CAN'T HELP YOURSELF,
CAN YOU?

26:26.185 --> 26:28.315
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE MICHAEL
REGRESSES PERMANENTLY

26:28.354 --> 26:31.324
TO THE AGE OF 12.

26:31.357 --> 26:34.087
HE'S 30, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE,
BRIAN.

26:34.126 --> 26:37.726
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S TIME
YOU LET HIM GO?

26:37.764 --> 26:39.404
- WELL,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.931
I WILL IF YOU WILL.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.197
- WHAT?

26:42.234 --> 26:45.644
- TELL HIM YOU'VE
BEEN IN LOVE WITH HIM...

26:45.672 --> 26:47.272
FOR YEARS.

26:47.306 --> 26:48.266
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

26:48.307 --> 26:52.277
- DON'T ACT SO INNOCENT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

26:54.413 --> 26:58.153
THE BOYS SAW YOUR PICTURES.

26:58.184 --> 27:01.124
THEY SAW YOUR
LITTLE SHRINE TO MIKEY,

27:01.153 --> 27:04.163
WHEN YOU WERE
IN YOUR COMA.

27:06.358 --> 27:10.128
OF COURSE,
I ALWAYS KNEW.

27:10.162 --> 27:14.672
SO, AS I SAID,

27:14.701 --> 27:18.741
YOU LET HIM GO,
AND SO WILL I.

27:18.771 --> 27:21.741
LADIES FIRST.

27:23.843 --> 27:26.313
- IS THIS CANDY OR DRUGS?

27:26.345 --> 27:27.775
- CANDY.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.784
I THINK.

27:29.816 --> 27:34.816
- YOU'D THINK WITH ALL THE PILLS
I TAKE THAT I'D KNOW.

27:34.854 --> 27:37.464
- SO HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

27:37.489 --> 27:41.759
- FIT AS A FIDDLE
AND READY FOR LOVE.

27:41.794 --> 27:45.234
WHY DO YOU ASK?

27:59.879 --> 28:02.949
LISTEN, WHY ARE YOU
SO INTERESTED IN ME

28:02.982 --> 28:04.352
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

28:04.383 --> 28:06.823
- OH, I WAS JUST WONDERING.

28:06.853 --> 28:07.723
- BULLSHIT.

28:07.754 --> 28:09.794
YOU BOYS NEVER TALK
TO ANYONE OVER 40

28:09.822 --> 28:14.462
UNLESS YOU HAVE TO.

28:14.493 --> 28:19.333
- I THINK I HAVE IT.

28:19.365 --> 28:22.325
- "IT" DOESN'T MEAN
WHAT IT USED TO, YOU KNOW.

28:22.368 --> 28:23.998
- THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.

28:24.036 --> 28:24.996
PEOPLE STILL--

28:25.037 --> 28:27.807
- DIE.
ALL THE TIME.

28:27.840 --> 28:31.080
BUT THEY DIE
FROM OTHER THINGS, TOO.

28:31.110 --> 28:33.810
YOU CAN'T THINK
ABOUT THAT.

28:33.846 --> 28:35.946
- I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME.

28:35.982 --> 28:38.082
I-I MEAN,
I'M NOT PROMISCUOUS.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.947
- WELL, LET ME TELL YOU
ABOUT PROMISCUOUS.

28:39.986 --> 28:44.156
PROMISCUOUS IS ANYONE
HAVING MORE SEX THAN YOU.

28:44.190 --> 28:47.490
- I THOUGHT I WAS
BEING SAFE, CAREFUL.

28:47.526 --> 28:50.426
- SEX ISN'T CAREFUL.

28:50.462 --> 28:54.202
AND IF IT IS,
YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.

28:54.233 --> 28:55.433
IT'S MESSY.

28:55.467 --> 28:57.937
AND IT'S HUMAN.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.470
AND IT'S MIXED UP
WITH OTHER THINGS.

29:00.506 --> 29:05.376
IT'S A GENIE WHO WON'T STAY
IN THE BOTTLE.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.251
LISTEN, EMMETT,

29:07.279 --> 29:10.119
IF YOU THINK
YOU MADE A MISTAKE,

29:10.149 --> 29:13.049
MOVE ON.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.985
AND ACCEPT IT LIKE A MAN.

29:20.159 --> 29:23.129
- [sighs]

29:45.117 --> 29:46.547
- HEY.

29:46.585 --> 29:47.815
HI.

30:09.208 --> 30:13.448
- 30 YEARS AGO,
I WAS YOU.

30:13.479 --> 30:16.449
AND 30 YEARS FROM NOW,
YOU'LL BE ME.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.422
30 YEARS.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.550
IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE
TO BELIEVE.

30:20.586 --> 30:21.546
HE'S A MAN,

30:21.587 --> 30:25.187
BUT HE STILL FEELS
AS TINY AND PRECIOUS TO ME

30:25.224 --> 30:28.164
AS GUS DOES TO YOU.

30:28.194 --> 30:30.434
- I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

30:30.462 --> 30:33.032
- GOES BY LIKE A DREAM.

30:33.065 --> 30:36.495
SO, I GUESS EVERYBODY
BREASTFEEDS NOWADAYS, HUH?

30:36.535 --> 30:41.605
- YEAH,
IT CREATES A REAL BOND.

30:41.640 --> 30:44.640
- I NEVER DID THAT
WITH MICHAEL,

30:44.676 --> 30:46.506
BUT I'D SAY
WE'RE PRETTY FUCKING TIGHT.

30:46.545 --> 30:49.475
- YEAH.
- [laughs]

30:49.515 --> 30:50.945
- SORRY, HONEY.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.483
YOU FEELING LEFT OUT?

30:52.518 --> 30:54.288
- ME, FEEL LEFT OUT?

30:54.320 --> 30:57.290
NOT WITH WHAT
IT'S COSTING ME A MONTH.

30:57.323 --> 30:59.133
- YOU KNOW, THEY SAY SOMETIMES
THE NON-BIRTH MOTHER

30:59.158 --> 31:00.358
LACTATES AS WELL.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.432
- [laughs]

31:02.461 --> 31:05.401
IF I DID,
IT'D BE MARGARITAS.

31:05.431 --> 31:08.231
PUT SOME SALT AROUND MY NIPPLE
AND TAKE A SIP.

31:08.267 --> 31:09.567
- MEL.
- COME ON, HEY.

31:09.601 --> 31:11.271
- PLEASE, MEL.

31:11.303 --> 31:12.673
- OH, I'M SORRY.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.044
I'M BEING INAPPROPRIATE.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.984
LINDSAY'S
NEVER INAPPROPRIATE.

31:17.009 --> 31:18.439
- DON'T MIND ME, HONEY.

31:18.477 --> 31:21.577
I WOULDN'T KNOW
FROM APPROPRIATE.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.553
- CAN I GET ANYONE
ANOTHER DRINKIE?

31:23.582 --> 31:24.552
DRINKIE?

31:24.583 --> 31:25.553
- NO, THANKS,

31:25.584 --> 31:26.994
AND I DON'T THINK YOU
SHOULD HAVE ONE EITHER.

31:27.019 --> 31:28.449
- HEY,
I'M NOT BREASTFEEDING.

31:28.487 --> 31:32.017
AIN'T MY PROBLEM.

31:37.129 --> 31:40.069
- HEY, EM.

31:49.675 --> 31:52.635
- OH, YEAH.

31:52.678 --> 31:57.618
[moaning]

32:36.022 --> 32:40.992
- PLEASE, GOD.
PLEASE, LET ME BE NEGATIVE.

32:41.027 --> 32:46.727
IF YOU DO,
I PROMISE, PROMISE, PROMISE--

32:46.765 --> 32:51.035
- IS SOMEONE IN THERE?

32:51.070 --> 32:53.710
[retches]

33:01.747 --> 33:03.177
[doorbell buzzes]

33:03.215 --> 33:06.145
- HELLO?

33:08.754 --> 33:11.364
- COME ON UP.

33:11.390 --> 33:14.460
AND GET YOUR COCK OUT.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.484
- HEY, TEDDY.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.523
THANKS AGAIN
FOR THE ELEPHANT UNDERWEAR.

33:36.548 --> 33:37.748
THEY'RE REALLY FUNNY.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.153
- YEAH, RIGHT.

33:39.185 --> 33:42.045
- NO, REALLY.

33:42.088 --> 33:45.088
- I BET YOU WEREN'T EXPECTING
TO SEE DAVID HERE, HUH?

33:45.124 --> 33:47.734
- YEAH,
TALK ABOUT SURPRISES.

33:47.759 --> 33:52.759
- SO, UH, DO YOU THINK YOU TWO
MIGHT, UH, YOU KNOW?

33:52.798 --> 33:57.568
- I DON'T--
I DON'T THINK SO.

33:57.603 --> 34:00.543
- THAT'S TOO BAD.

34:00.572 --> 34:02.342
- SAY, LISTEN,

34:02.374 --> 34:05.214
I KNOW
THERE'S THIS PART OF US

34:05.244 --> 34:08.754
THAT THINKS WE DON'T
DESERVE TO BE LOVED.

34:08.780 --> 34:09.850
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

34:09.880 --> 34:12.150
- L-LET ME FINISH.

34:12.184 --> 34:15.724
SO WE FALL IN LOVE
WITH SOMEONE

34:15.754 --> 34:18.164
WE KNOW WE CAN'T HAVE

34:18.190 --> 34:22.159
AND WHO'S NEVER GOING
TO LOVE US.

34:22.194 --> 34:26.474
AND WE FANTASIZE...

34:28.199 --> 34:29.000
ABOUT THE DAY

34:29.034 --> 34:32.504
WHEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HE REALIZES,

34:32.538 --> 34:35.638
AND SEES EVERYTHING
HE'S BEEN MISSING,

34:35.674 --> 34:38.514
YOU KNOW, AND--AND
ALL OUR DREAMS COME TRUE,

34:38.543 --> 34:41.853
ONLY, UH, YOU KNOW,
THAT DAY NEVER COMES

34:41.880 --> 34:43.480
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

34:43.514 --> 34:46.614
IT'S YOUR 40th BIRTHDAY,
IT'S YOUR 50th BIRTHDAY,

34:46.652 --> 34:51.292
AND--AND YOU'RE STILL ALONE.

34:54.860 --> 34:59.900
DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN
TO YOU, MICHAEL.

34:59.931 --> 35:03.501
LOVE SOMEONE FOR REAL.

35:06.172 --> 35:09.112
SOMEONE WHO LOVES YOU.

35:16.648 --> 35:21.488
- OH, MY GOD.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.460
TRACY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

35:23.489 --> 35:26.359
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MIKE.

35:26.392 --> 35:28.662
- THANKS.
UH, IT'S REALLY WILD.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.634
I--
THEY'RE ALL A LITTLE DRUNK.

35:30.662 --> 35:33.472
I DON'T REAL--
I ONLY KNOW SIX OF THEM.

35:33.499 --> 35:34.769
- YOUR FRIEND BRIAN CALLED.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.870
HE ASKED ME TO COME.
- WHAT?

35:37.903 --> 35:40.243
LOOK, UH,
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

35:40.272 --> 35:41.812
'CAUSE THERE'S THIS, UM,
BURGER PLACE RIGHT NEAR HERE

35:41.840 --> 35:44.240
WE COULD GO GET A BITE--
- TRACY.

35:44.276 --> 35:46.646
I AM SO HAPPY
THAT YOU COULD MAKE IT

35:46.678 --> 35:51.378
TO MICHAEL'S
SURPRISE PARTY.

35:51.417 --> 35:54.787
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO A FEW OF OUR GUESTS.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.320
- BRIAN!

35:56.355 --> 35:59.225
- DAVID.

35:59.258 --> 36:00.458
DAVID, THIS IS TRACY.

36:00.492 --> 36:01.562
TRACY, THIS IS DAVID.

36:01.593 --> 36:02.893
- TRACY, YEAH, WE MET.

36:02.928 --> 36:04.828
- RIGHT, YOU'RE MIKE'S
CHIROPRACTOR.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.373
- RIGHT.

36:06.398 --> 36:11.238
- HE'S ALSO HIS BOYFRIEND.

36:11.270 --> 36:15.540
OH, EXCUSE ME.
EX-BOYFRIEND.

36:15.574 --> 36:16.844
THE FIRST TIME
THEY FUCKED,

36:16.875 --> 36:21.505
MICHAEL CAME,
LIKE, THREE TIMES.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.577
[all gasping]

36:29.321 --> 36:31.961
- MIKE.

36:31.990 --> 36:33.960
WHY DON'T YOU BUY
YOUR FRIEND, TRACY, A DRINK?

36:33.992 --> 36:36.962
LOOKS LIKE
SHE COULD USE ONE.

36:42.668 --> 36:45.268
DON'T GO YET, MIKEY.
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN HAD YOUR CAKE.

36:45.304 --> 36:47.514
- FUCK OFF!

36:49.341 --> 36:51.781
- [spits]
[balloon pops]

36:53.279 --> 36:55.849
- TRACY.

36:58.784 --> 37:02.494
IT'S TRUE.

37:02.521 --> 37:05.261
DAVID WAS MY BOYFRIEND.

37:13.832 --> 37:16.672
- DO YOU LAUGH AT ME?

37:16.702 --> 37:17.942
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS?

37:17.969 --> 37:19.339
THE BOYS,
DO YOU LAUGH AT ME?

37:19.371 --> 37:21.471
- NO. NO.

37:21.507 --> 37:24.877
- I MUST BE A BIG JOKE
TO YOU, HUH?

37:24.910 --> 37:27.580
THE GIRL AT WORK.
THE ONE WHO HAS THE CRUSH.

37:27.613 --> 37:29.883
SHE'S SO FUNNY
BECAUSE SHE'S SO STUPID.

37:29.915 --> 37:32.445
- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT,
I SWEAR.

37:32.484 --> 37:35.924
- YOU'RE A LIAR, MIKE.
A LIAR.

37:50.636 --> 37:53.566
- [sniffs]

37:56.542 --> 37:57.642
- HEY.

37:57.676 --> 38:01.746
LOOK WHAT I HAD COOKED UP
FOR THIS SPECIAL OCCASION.

38:01.780 --> 38:04.050
- I'D LIKE TO GET OUT OF HERE,
HOW ABOUT YOU?

38:04.082 --> 38:06.052
- YEAH.

38:06.084 --> 38:09.564
- DON'T FORGET THIS.

38:09.588 --> 38:12.388
- I DON'T WANT IT.

38:12.424 --> 38:15.834
THANKS FOR THE PARTY.

38:18.430 --> 38:19.400
- WELL, BRIAN,

38:19.431 --> 38:22.531
YOU REALLY KNOW
HOW TO THROW A BIRTHDAY BASH.

38:22.568 --> 38:27.538
- TOO BAD ALL GOOD THINGS
MUST COME TO AN END.

38:27.573 --> 38:29.413
- WELL, WELL, WELL.

38:29.441 --> 38:30.781
IS ANYONE SURPRISED?

38:30.809 --> 38:32.509
THAT'S THE WAY
HE TREATS PEOPLE.

38:32.544 --> 38:34.384
AM I RIGHT?

38:34.413 --> 38:36.083
I MEAN,
IS THERE ANYONE HERE TONIGHT

38:36.114 --> 38:39.994
THAT HASN'T BEEN FUCKED
BY BRIAN KINNEY

38:40.018 --> 38:42.818
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER?

38:42.854 --> 38:45.424
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

38:45.457 --> 38:49.427
NOW MICHAEL HAS BEEN, TOO.

38:49.461 --> 38:53.701
- SO YOU FINALLY GAVE HIM
WHAT HE WANTED.

38:53.732 --> 38:56.542
GOOD FOR YOU.

39:00.606 --> 39:02.906
- HOW COULD YOU HAVE
DONE THAT TO HIM, BRIAN?

39:02.941 --> 39:07.481
YOUR BEST FRIEND
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

39:15.687 --> 39:18.657
- WELL?

39:18.690 --> 39:20.630
AREN'T YOU GOING
TO MAKE YOUR BIG EXIT, TOO?

39:20.659 --> 39:23.999
- NO.

39:24.029 --> 39:24.799
YOU'RE GOING
TO NEED SOMEONE

39:24.830 --> 39:27.830
TO HELP YOU
CLEAN UP THIS MESS.

39:38.143 --> 39:40.583
- UH, COME IN,
TAKE OFF YOUR THINGS--

39:40.612 --> 39:45.152
YOUR COAT--
AND RELAX.

39:45.183 --> 39:46.893
- THANKS.

39:46.918 --> 39:49.018
- WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK?

39:49.054 --> 39:53.094
- NO, I THINK
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

39:53.124 --> 39:54.694
THAT WAS SOME PARTY, HUH?

39:54.726 --> 39:56.756
- IT HAD ITS MOMENTS.

39:56.795 --> 40:00.165
- LIKE WHEN YOU
PUNCHED HIM.

40:00.198 --> 40:02.628
- HE DESERVED IT.

40:02.668 --> 40:04.538
- HE DESERVED WORSE.

40:04.570 --> 40:09.710
- I-I JUST DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.

40:11.510 --> 40:13.040
- I MISSED YOU.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.648
- HAVE YOU?

40:14.680 --> 40:16.780
- YEAH, I HAVE.

40:29.895 --> 40:34.695
- I-I'M NOT SURE
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE RIGHT NOW.

40:37.703 --> 40:39.813
- I WANT TO TAKE YOU UP
ON YOUR OFFER,

40:39.838 --> 40:42.168
TO LIVE TOGETHER.

40:42.207 --> 40:46.907
I WANT
TO GIVE IT A SHOT.

40:46.945 --> 40:50.975
- I'M NOT
A CONSOLATION PRIZE.

40:53.051 --> 40:57.521
- I KNOW THAT.

40:57.556 --> 40:59.926
YOU'RE FIRST PRIZE.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.928
- YOU'RE SURE?

41:01.960 --> 41:06.670
- I'M 30.

41:06.698 --> 41:11.068
IT'S TIME I SETTLED DOWN
AND TOOK ON SOME RESPONSIBILITY.

41:11.102 --> 41:12.542
- OH, UH-UH.

41:12.571 --> 41:16.741
NOW YOU'RE MAKING ME
SOUND LIKE LIFE INSURANCE.

41:16.775 --> 41:20.075
- WELL, IN A WAY,
YOU ARE.

41:23.014 --> 41:27.594
DO YOU STILL LOVE ME?

41:27.619 --> 41:32.219
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

41:36.261 --> 41:38.161
- COME.

42:00.051 --> 42:04.061
- HE ASKED ME TO PICK UP
THE STUFF HE LEFT.

42:12.764 --> 42:14.734
HEY, SUNSHINE.

42:14.766 --> 42:16.196
YOU GOT SOME TABLES
TO BUS.

42:16.234 --> 42:19.144
- [groans]

42:19.170 --> 42:21.270
I DON'T FEEL SICK.

42:21.306 --> 42:23.266
MARGARITAS ARE DEFINITELY
MY DRINK.

42:23.308 --> 42:26.678
- GET UP.

42:41.627 --> 42:43.187
YOU WANT SOME COFFEE?

42:43.228 --> 42:46.158
- NO, THANKS.

42:49.234 --> 42:52.674
CHRIST, I WAS PISSED AT YOU
LAST NIGHT.

42:52.704 --> 42:56.984
EVERYBODY WAS.
IS.

42:57.008 --> 42:59.948
BUT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY CUSSING YOU OUT,

42:59.978 --> 43:04.818
I FINALLY
FIGURED IT OUT.

43:04.850 --> 43:08.790
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING QUIETLY,
CAN YOU?

43:08.820 --> 43:13.260
EVERYTHING'S GOTTA
BE A SPECTACLE, A DRAMA.

43:13.291 --> 43:18.761
YOU COULDN'T HAVE
PUSHED HIM SOFTLY.

43:18.797 --> 43:21.997
YOU HAD TO SHOVE HIM
OFF A FUCKING CLIFF.

43:22.033 --> 43:23.373
- YEAH, I HAD TO.

43:23.401 --> 43:28.341
OTHERWISE, HE WOULD HAVE
JUST FOLLOWED ME AROUND FOREVER.

43:30.308 --> 43:33.808
- YEAH, I GUESS
HE WOULD HAVE.

43:36.982 --> 43:38.382
JUSTIN!

43:38.416 --> 43:42.016
- I'M BRUSHING MY TEETH.

43:42.053 --> 43:43.793
- YOU LOANED HIM
YOUR TOOTHBRUSH?

43:43.822 --> 43:45.262
- I HAVE A SUPPLY.

43:45.290 --> 43:48.430
- OH.

43:48.459 --> 43:50.929
- IT WAS THE ONLY WAY.

43:50.962 --> 43:54.972
- THIS DAVID,
HE'S GOOD FOR HIM.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.140
- YEAH, THAT WON'T LAST.

43:58.169 --> 44:01.039
- MAYBE NOT.

44:01.072 --> 44:03.882
BUT HE SHOULD AT LEAST
GIVE IT A TRY.

44:03.909 --> 44:06.339
- SO, HOW'S HE DOING?

44:06.377 --> 44:10.777
- TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY HIS
BEST FRIEND WOULD BETRAY HIM.

44:10.816 --> 44:12.276
OF COURSE,
HE DOESN'T REALIZE

44:12.317 --> 44:16.147
THAT IT'S THE BEST THING
THAT COULD EVER HAPPEN,

44:16.187 --> 44:19.057
THAT YOU DID HIM A FAVOR.

44:19.090 --> 44:24.060
THAT MAYBE NOW HE CAN FINALLY
HAVE A CHANCE TO HAVE A LIFE.

44:25.096 --> 44:28.066
- OKAY.
I'M READY TO GO.

44:45.050 --> 44:48.150
- YOU TAKE CARE,
KIDDO.

44:51.823 --> 44:54.693
THANK YOU.

45:26.391 --> 45:28.991
- WELL, HELLO,
EARLY BIRDS.

45:29.027 --> 45:31.297
- HI.
CAN WE SKIP THE CHIT-CHAT?

45:31.329 --> 45:32.299
WE'VE BEEN HERE
FOR AN HOUR.

45:32.330 --> 45:34.800
- HOUR AND A HALF.

45:34.833 --> 45:37.103
- JUST, UH, JUST GIVE IT
TO ME STRAIGHT.

45:37.135 --> 45:39.165
- OH, THE--THE MESSAGE
I LEFT FOR YOU ON FRIDAY.

45:39.204 --> 45:40.244
- YEAH.

45:40.271 --> 45:42.511
- WELL, UM,
HERE'S THE SITUATION.

45:42.540 --> 45:44.310
- OKAY,
SPARE ME THE, YOU KNOW,

45:44.342 --> 45:46.442
THE "WARM HIM UP,
LET HIM DOWN EASY" SPEECH.

45:46.477 --> 45:48.847
JUST--JUST TELL ME.

45:48.880 --> 45:51.150
- YOUR CHECK BOUNCED.

45:51.182 --> 45:52.322
- WHAT?

45:52.350 --> 45:53.520
- YOUR CHECK BOUNCED.

45:53.551 --> 45:56.021
INSUFFICIENT FUNDS.

45:56.054 --> 45:57.994
- PERFECT.
HOW MUCH?

45:58.023 --> 46:00.263
- $60.

46:00.291 --> 46:02.091
- HERE.
YOU'RE PAYING ME BACK.

46:02.127 --> 46:03.797
- OKAY, WHO GIVES A SHIT
ABOUT 60 BUCKS?

46:03.829 --> 46:04.659
I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU
IN MY WILL.

46:04.695 --> 46:07.865
UM, CAN I HAVE
MY TEST RESULTS, PLEASE?

46:07.899 --> 46:10.369
- YOU'RE FINE.

46:10.401 --> 46:13.271
CONGRATULATIONS.

46:16.074 --> 46:17.414
- OH, MY GOD.

46:17.442 --> 46:20.182
- I TOLD YOU.

46:20.211 --> 46:24.951
- SO, UH, HOW'D YOU LIKE
TO CELEBRATE?

46:29.020 --> 46:31.390
- UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T.

46:31.422 --> 46:34.862
I'M, UH, I'M BUSY.

46:34.893 --> 46:36.963
- OKAY.

46:36.995 --> 46:40.265
WELL, UH, I'LL SEE YOU
AROUND, GUYS.

46:40.298 --> 46:44.368
HAVE A NICE DAY.

46:47.605 --> 46:49.605
- HE'S CUTE.

46:49.640 --> 46:53.280
IF YOU DON'T WANT HIM,
I'LL TAKE HIM.

46:53.311 --> 46:55.311
- YOU CAN HAVE HIM.

46:55.346 --> 46:58.046
I MADE A PROMISE TO GOD.

46:58.083 --> 47:00.453
- A PROMISE TO GOD?
WHAT PROMISE TO GOD?

47:00.485 --> 47:04.055
- I PRAYED AND, UH,
AND TOLD GOD

47:04.089 --> 47:06.189
THAT IF I WERE NEGATIVE,

47:06.224 --> 47:09.034
I WOULD NEVER HAVE SEX
WITH ANOTHER MAN.

47:09.060 --> 47:11.460
AND I'M NEGATIVE.

47:11.496 --> 47:17.096
SO I CAN NEVER
TOUCH A MAN AGAIN.

47:20.571 --> 47:22.211
