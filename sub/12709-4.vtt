00:01.169 --> 00:03.003
GILES: Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:03.036 --> 00:05.238
-Anya.
-I thought
you were with Giles.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.841
-Studying how
to not kill people.
-I just got back.

00:07.875 --> 00:10.510
Are you asking me
to be a counselor?

00:10.544 --> 00:12.212
Spike's been staying
 in the school basement.

00:12.246 --> 00:14.381
Xander's there doing
construction on the new gym.

00:14.414 --> 00:17.184
-I was, uh, wondering why I--
-Have this job?

00:17.217 --> 00:19.053
I still haven't
finished college.

00:19.086 --> 00:21.655
These students need
someone around here
who understands them.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.225
I need someone who understands
these students.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.506
MAN:
You did good work on her.
She looks good.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.874
MAN 2:
Thanks. She's all set
for the service tomorrow.

00:40.908 --> 00:42.743
MAN:
Good.

00:44.411 --> 00:46.914
All right, then.
I'll see you in the morning.
(Door Opens)

00:46.947 --> 00:49.216
MAN 2:
Good night.
(Door Closes)

00:56.557 --> 00:58.558
(Grunts)

01:12.840 --> 01:15.275
Hey.
Sorry.

01:15.308 --> 01:19.480
Thirty-three minutes.
Since when do we go to all this
trouble for one lousy vampire?

01:19.513 --> 01:22.615
Excuse me.
One lousy, potential vampire.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.585
Vampire by vampire.
It's the only way
I know how.

01:25.618 --> 01:27.120
(Knocking)

01:30.290 --> 01:32.058
(Gasping)

01:32.091 --> 01:37.997
I think this thing has
a freakin' child lock on it.

01:38.031 --> 01:40.334
-Shh.
-You know, I'm not
the shortest one here.

01:40.367 --> 01:42.735
I don't know why I had to be
in the kid coffin.

01:42.770 --> 01:46.807
-Look, I know it's my job--
-No. I'm sorry. I wanna help.

01:46.840 --> 01:50.743
I guess I've been a bit
stressed out lately.
I'm sorry I took it out on you.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.347
No big. I've been kind of
stressed myself.

01:53.381 --> 01:56.015
Well, the whole Willow sitch
is not unstressifying.

01:56.049 --> 01:59.186
I mean, she's here,
but not part of the gang here,

01:59.219 --> 02:03.022
and hopefully not under
my feet here in another
time dimension... here.

02:03.055 --> 02:08.461
There's Willow.
There's the looming humongo bad.
And it's a school night.

02:08.496 --> 02:11.131
I should be home in bed
cuddling up to my insomnia...

02:11.164 --> 02:12.800
and worrying about how
I'm going to mess up tomorrow.

02:12.832 --> 02:15.203
You'll be fine.
You'll be a great counselor.

02:15.235 --> 02:17.638
It's my first week
actually talking to the kids.

02:17.670 --> 02:20.007
What if their problems
are all weird and tricky?

02:20.039 --> 02:24.010
Well, I think you underestimate
your familiarity with
the world of weird and tricky.

02:24.044 --> 02:25.878
This job's perfect for you.

02:25.913 --> 02:31.519
Check out perfect me.
Taking my sister on an
educational outing to the--

02:31.551 --> 02:33.287
Dead body.

02:33.320 --> 02:36.289
XANDER: I don't know.
Amateur opinion here,
but she looks dead.

02:36.324 --> 02:38.558
I mean, like
natural-causes dead.

02:38.591 --> 02:41.829
The paper said she had
unusual cuts and contusions
on her neck.

02:41.861 --> 02:45.164
Maybe she cut herself shaving
and then died naturally
of embarrassment.

02:47.099 --> 02:49.802
She looks... peaceful.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.906
I am not peaceful.

02:52.939 --> 02:55.408
That I can help with.
(Grunts)

02:58.177 --> 03:01.048
I always thought closed caskets
were more tasteful anyway.

03:04.585 --> 03:08.121
(Theme music plays)

03:58.739 --> 04:00.640
(Chattering)

04:03.110 --> 04:04.812
GIRL:
Yeah. I'll see you guys later.

04:11.117 --> 04:13.486
(Whirring)

04:17.189 --> 04:19.992
(Whirring)

04:20.026 --> 04:24.598
-Hello.
-Come in. Hi.

04:28.369 --> 04:31.971
-Mr. Miller sent me here.
-Do you know why?

04:32.004 --> 04:34.942
I'm not sure.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.978
Maybe 'cause this guy
was picking on me.

04:40.279 --> 04:44.752
-I don't wanna talk to you.
-Okay. That's fine.

04:44.784 --> 04:48.521
-I'm serious.
I don't wanna talk.
-Okay.

04:48.555 --> 04:52.024
You know, I hate to miss bio,
but I thought it was best
I come speak with you.

04:52.058 --> 04:56.764
-So what's on your mind?
-On my mind?

04:56.797 --> 04:59.533
Are you worried about school?

04:59.567 --> 05:03.336
Uh, friends, girls,
your parents?

05:03.370 --> 05:05.439
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
My parents.

05:05.473 --> 05:11.711
-So what about them?
-Um, issues of divorce.

05:11.745 --> 05:14.348
You know, it's awful
being teased,

05:14.382 --> 05:17.485
but the thing is, you know,
with bullies like this,
they're really just--

05:17.518 --> 05:21.721
Insecure? Yeah,
everyone says that.

05:21.754 --> 05:25.658
You know, I'm really tired
of everyone being so insecure.

05:36.836 --> 05:40.307
Divorce is terrible.
My parents got divorced
when I was a kid.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.310
Yeah. My parents
are happily married.

05:43.343 --> 05:47.480
It's hard. You know,
I feel left out.

05:47.514 --> 05:51.485
But I'm also concerned
about girls.

05:51.519 --> 05:54.754
(Forced Chuckle)
Okay. I'm just bored.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.627
Uh, maybe I should
get back to bio?

06:03.463 --> 06:06.199
You have to stick up
for yourself, Amanda.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.869
You need to show this bully
that you're not going to
take anymore of his shi--

06:08.901 --> 06:11.904
Guff. Any guff.

06:11.939 --> 06:15.442
'Cause that's what I did.
I stuck up for myself.

06:15.475 --> 06:19.579
The other day after class,
I jumped him in
the parking lot,

06:19.612 --> 06:23.050
and I slammed his stupid-ass,
insecure face right into
the pavement.

06:23.082 --> 06:25.084
You... what?

06:25.117 --> 06:27.588
I guess that's another reason
Mr. Miller wanted me to see you.

06:27.620 --> 06:30.990
-(Weak Chuckle)
-Do you think I should
pound on him some more?

06:33.326 --> 06:35.629
I bet she's giving 'em
great advice.
Absolutely.

06:35.663 --> 06:41.100
Those kids are lucky to have
Buffy looking out for them.
I just wish she believed it.

06:41.134 --> 06:47.206
She's still stressing over the
whole dropped out of college,
not actually qualified thing.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.610
Plus, the salivating Hellmouth
underneath her feet
and the whole--

06:50.644 --> 06:54.615
"From beneath you, it devours."
It's not the friendliest jingle,
is it?

06:54.648 --> 06:58.317
It's no "I like Ike"
or "Milk. It does a body good."

06:58.350 --> 07:02.422
I know.
It's gonna be bad.

07:02.523 --> 07:06.593
It's gonna be real bad.
And I wonder, will I--

07:06.627 --> 07:11.331
Well, if it comes--
when it comes--
will I be able to help?

07:11.363 --> 07:14.768
I think so.
I don't know.

07:14.802 --> 07:17.971
I don't know
what I can do.

07:18.004 --> 07:21.074
I mean, frankly,
I'm-I'm scared of
what I might do.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.843
Yeah, I get that.

07:22.875 --> 07:28.314
Figuring out how to control
your magic seems a lot like
hammering a nail.

07:28.348 --> 07:31.752
Well, hear me out.
So you're hammering, right?

07:31.785 --> 07:34.855
If you hold the end of
the hammer, you have the power,
but no control.

07:34.887 --> 07:38.492
It takes, like, two strokes
to hit the nail in,
or you could hit your thumb.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.593
Ouch.
So you choke up.

07:40.627 --> 07:45.665
Control, but no power.
It could take, like,
10 strokes to knock the nail in.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.768
Power, control.
It's a trade-off.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.103
That's actually
not a bad analogy.

07:51.137 --> 07:55.808
Thanks.
Except I'm less worried about
hitting my thumb...

07:55.843 --> 07:59.146
and more worried about
going all black-eyed baddie...

07:59.178 --> 08:03.449
and bewitching that hammer
into cracking my friends'
skulls open like coconuts.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.452
Right. Ouch.

08:06.485 --> 08:08.656
Sorry.

08:08.689 --> 08:13.694
(Sighs)
Xander, being back here,
I don't know.

08:13.726 --> 08:16.028
It'll take time.

08:18.430 --> 08:22.702
(Loud Sigh)
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

09:05.144 --> 09:06.980
Hey.

09:16.222 --> 09:19.259
(Sniffling)
It's me.

09:27.634 --> 09:30.302
I'm scared.

09:31.804 --> 09:33.539
I don't wanna be
left all alone.

09:33.572 --> 09:37.076
My brother's joining up
with the marines.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.980
(Sharp Exhale)

09:41.014 --> 09:45.653
You know, if he knew I was
making a fool of myself,
he'd smack me on my head.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.453
I guess I'm just being stupid.

09:47.486 --> 09:51.490
Sounds like
your brother's pretty tough.
Yeah. You know, he's a man.

09:51.524 --> 09:55.162
-I'm just all messed up
right now.
-You are not messed up.

09:55.195 --> 09:58.097
It's not "messed up"
to worry about your brother.

09:58.130 --> 09:59.932
What if he doesn't come back?

10:02.101 --> 10:05.739
-What if he gets blown up?
-Have you talked to him?

10:05.773 --> 10:07.975
Have you told him
how you feel?
No.

10:08.008 --> 10:11.244
No. I-I don't wanna
talk to him.
I don't wanna do that.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.580
I don't wanna talk to him.
Okay.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.615
You understand?

10:15.649 --> 10:17.650
So, Josh,
what's on your mind?

10:17.684 --> 10:20.754
Well, um,
I'm worried that I'm gay.

10:20.788 --> 10:25.993
Okay. First of all, I think
it's great that you would come
and talk to me about this.

10:26.025 --> 10:30.963
Second of all, you should know
that there is nothing shameful
about being gay. Nothing.

10:30.998 --> 10:35.335
I-I know. It's just
I'm not positive,

10:35.368 --> 10:38.004
so, uh,
I was thinking that...

10:38.038 --> 10:41.908
why don't you go on a date
with me so I can be sure?

10:49.349 --> 10:52.619
It sounds like
it's difficult for you.

10:52.652 --> 10:57.190
Like maybe your sister
makes it hard for you
to establish your own identity.

10:57.224 --> 11:01.894
You said she's controlling.
She doesn't let you make
your own decisions.

11:01.928 --> 11:05.398
Yeah, and she borrows
my clothes without asking.
I understand.

11:05.432 --> 11:08.400
That must be hard.

11:08.434 --> 11:12.239
So you're not
doing your homework?
I guess not.

11:12.272 --> 11:18.311
It all just seems
kind of... whatever.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.580
I know high school
can seem kind of frustrating.

11:20.613 --> 11:23.250
But if you just get through it,
then you can go to college,

11:23.283 --> 11:27.653
or you can join
the French foreign legion
or anything you want.

11:27.687 --> 11:31.224
Yeah, well,
I'm not gonna do all that stuff.

11:31.258 --> 11:36.328
Okay, no foreign legion.
I get that. I mean,
all the changing your name...

11:36.363 --> 11:39.832
and being indentured for
all those years
and occupying Algeria.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.668
(Laughs)
It's just that I'm not
graduating from high school.

11:42.701 --> 11:47.106
-Why not?
-I really like that shirt.
Where did you get it?

11:47.139 --> 11:49.909
Cassie, don't change
the subject.
Why won't you graduate?

11:52.544 --> 11:55.215
Because next Friday
I'm gonna die.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.759
-What?
-Can we talk about
something else?

12:06.793 --> 12:08.796
No. We have to
talk about this.

12:08.828 --> 12:12.865
Just--
Never mind.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.735
-Cassie, what makes you
feel like this?
-Feel like what?

12:15.769 --> 12:20.407
-Like you wanna hurt yourself.
-I'm not gonna commit suicide,

12:20.440 --> 12:22.208
if that's
what you're saying.

12:22.241 --> 12:26.712
No way.
Okay, then.
Then what are you saying?

12:26.745 --> 12:28.315
Look, I don't mean
to be a pain.

12:28.347 --> 12:30.616
You seem really nice, and I know
you're just trying to help.

12:30.649 --> 12:34.421
But I'm wasting your time.
No, you're not.
This is why I'm here.

12:34.453 --> 12:37.389
Cassie, please tell me, why
do you think you're gonna die?

12:37.423 --> 12:41.128
I don't think it.
I know it. I just know.

12:41.161 --> 12:45.398
What do you mean you know?
Are you saying that
someone's gonna hurt you?

12:45.432 --> 12:48.634
-Has someone threatened you?
-No. No.

12:48.668 --> 12:51.337
I-I just know that
next Friday I'm gonna die.

12:51.370 --> 12:56.475
Some things I just know.
I don't know how. I just do.

12:56.509 --> 12:59.745
-Like I know there'll be coins.
-Coins?

12:59.778 --> 13:04.417
Mm-hmm. Lots of coins.
Weird ones.

13:04.451 --> 13:08.654
And I know that you'll go
someplace dark underground.

13:08.687 --> 13:12.259
-I-I don't know.
-What do you mean
underground?

13:12.292 --> 13:15.662
-I know you'll try to help.
-Cassie, I don't understand
what you're saying.

13:15.695 --> 13:19.499
But you can't, okay?

13:19.532 --> 13:24.671
I gotta go. Trig. I don't want
Mr. Corrigan sending me
to Principal Wood again.

13:24.703 --> 13:26.706
Cassie, please--
Thanks for being so nice.

13:26.739 --> 13:31.177
I really do like that shirt.
You should put a sweater on
so it doesn't get stained.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.879
I gotta go.
Cassie, wait. Please.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.615
-I gotta go.
-What am I supposed to do?

13:35.648 --> 13:38.451
Well, you did what you were
supposed to do. You reported
the situation to me.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.821
-And?
-Listen, Buffy, it's hard.

13:41.855 --> 13:44.991
Kids this age, they're hurting,
they're pissed off,
and they say things.

13:45.024 --> 13:47.193
Sometimes they say awful things.

13:47.226 --> 13:52.465
When I was in high school,
I had a thing with this guy,
right? Real bully.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.335
I kept telling everyone that
he'd better sleep with
one eye open...

13:55.368 --> 13:57.703
'cause I was gonna
bust his ass.

13:57.736 --> 14:00.639
Well, I got suspended.

14:00.673 --> 14:04.543
-Talk like that is taken pretty
seriously where I come from.
-The hood?

14:04.576 --> 14:07.014
Beverly Hills.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.283
Which is a hood.

14:12.619 --> 14:16.088
Listen, the point is
I was talking big
because I was scared.

14:16.123 --> 14:19.392
I couldn't bust a move
in high school,
let alone someone's ass.

14:19.426 --> 14:23.529
Most of the time that's what
it is when these students
act out. Fear. Pain.

14:23.562 --> 14:26.066
But sometimes
it's not just talk, right?

14:26.099 --> 14:30.269
Every time there's a threat
like this, we do the same dance.

14:30.302 --> 14:32.772
Inform teachers.
Search lockers.

14:32.804 --> 14:37.376
But we can't--we can't know
what's gonna happen, and
we can't search their brains.

14:37.409 --> 14:40.547
We just--
We just do what we can.

14:40.580 --> 14:43.515
It's not enough.
I need to fix this.

14:43.549 --> 14:47.120
-I don't usually get a heads-up
before somebody dies.
-What do you mean usually?

14:47.153 --> 14:50.756
No. No, not since--
(Exhales)

14:50.789 --> 14:55.128
I-I mean, I'm sure
it's not usual to get a chance
to stop something like--

14:55.162 --> 14:57.864
I just--
I need to do something, okay?

14:57.897 --> 15:01.734
I have to make this better.
Oh! Oh. Shoot.

15:14.346 --> 15:16.716
I have a job for you.

15:16.749 --> 15:21.620
What are you drawing?
Don't you have a history test
to study for?

15:21.653 --> 15:24.490
BOY:
Why don't you
design me a tattoo?

15:26.125 --> 15:29.962
A tattoo?
Oh, right. I can imagine that.

15:29.996 --> 15:34.334
Come on. Design something
and maybe we can get
matching tattoos.

15:34.366 --> 15:37.269
(Laughs)
How about a snake with some fire
coming out of its mouth?

15:37.303 --> 15:40.506
Mmm. Or a sexy hula girl
that wiggles when you flex?

15:40.539 --> 15:43.309
Yeah, now you're talking.
A sexy hula girl.

15:43.342 --> 15:47.679
But a sexy snake hula girl.
(Cassie Giggles)
You're so ridiculous.

15:50.017 --> 15:54.254
So I was thinking
maybe we should go to
that dance after all.

15:54.287 --> 15:57.456
What do you mean "after all"?
I told you I don't wanna go.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.293
Well, I assumed
you were kidding.

16:00.326 --> 16:05.131
-It'd probably be lame anyways.
-Well, yeah,
but lame is funny.

16:05.164 --> 16:09.001
And, you know, maybe fun if,
you know, we're hanging out
together.

16:09.035 --> 16:11.303
We hang out together
all the time.

16:11.337 --> 16:15.375
Right. And therefore
we should hang out together
at the winter formal.

16:17.677 --> 16:22.948
Hey. Um,
I'm in ceramics class with you.

16:22.981 --> 16:27.019
I'm Dawn Summers.
I forgot if we had
an assignment last week.

16:27.053 --> 16:31.490
I spaced.
Right, um--Hey, Dawn.

16:31.524 --> 16:35.028
Uh, yeah. You know,
we did have an assignment,
but I didn't write it down.

16:35.062 --> 16:37.697
I think something to do
with glazes.

16:37.730 --> 16:42.068
As scintillating as
the pottery talk is,
I'd better actually go study.

16:43.102 --> 16:45.404
I'm Mike, by the way.

16:45.437 --> 16:48.575
Hi. Uh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to--

16:48.607 --> 16:53.245
Don't worry about it.
I'd better go hit the books
if I'm gonna ace this test.

16:53.279 --> 16:56.014
Nice meeting you though.
Cass, I'll see you later?
Yeah.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.520
Hey, Mike,
you're gonna get a "B."

17:01.553 --> 17:03.590
Oh, A-plus, baby.
A-plus.

17:06.093 --> 17:08.728
So, um,
is that any good?

17:08.760 --> 17:11.498
Yeah. Actually, yeah.

17:11.530 --> 17:15.902
What do you have to
read it for?
Oh, just for me, I guess.

17:15.934 --> 17:19.538
I kind of stopped reading
my homework assignments.
I just read what I want.

17:19.570 --> 17:23.843
That's so cool.
I'd do that, but my sister'd
be down my neck in a second.

17:23.875 --> 17:29.249
Summers. Hey, are you
the counselor's
little sister?

17:29.281 --> 17:34.421
No. She's my sister.
Lucky me, huh?

17:34.453 --> 17:37.923
No, no. She's really nice.
I actually just saw her
this morning.

17:37.957 --> 17:40.160
Oh, really?
What about?

17:42.595 --> 17:45.897
I-I'm sorry.
That's none of my business.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.433
No. I don't care.

17:47.467 --> 17:51.938
So, Mike's a cutie.
Are you guys going to
that dance?

17:51.971 --> 17:54.941
No, I don't think so.
Oh.

17:54.973 --> 17:56.976
I mean,
didn't he ask you?

17:57.009 --> 17:59.578
(Scoffs)
Like a hundred and five times.

17:59.612 --> 18:03.715
-And you said no?
-A hundred and six times.

18:03.750 --> 18:07.519
No, I can't go.
I'm not gonna be around
that night.

18:09.955 --> 18:14.394
Cassie's records
all show the same thing.
Good grades. Good kid.

18:14.426 --> 18:18.498
Then all of a sudden
not so good grades.
Absenteeism.

18:18.530 --> 18:21.233
Comments about apathy
and depression.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.336
So the question is,
what changed?

18:23.369 --> 18:25.904
Right. If she did have
some sort of psychic vision
that would explain it.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.941
Do you really think this girl
is some kind of precog?

18:28.974 --> 18:31.810
I don't know.
I told you about
the shirt, right?

18:31.844 --> 18:35.815
Buff, you spilled a cup
of coffee. I'm not saying
you don't have Slayer grace,

18:35.847 --> 18:39.018
-but it's not the first time.
-I mean, maybe--just maybe--

18:39.050 --> 18:43.690
you're trying so hard to help
that you're seeing paranormal
when there's just normal.

18:43.722 --> 18:47.326
Maybe, but maybe not.

18:47.359 --> 18:49.662
You want me to check
her medical records?
(Sighs)

18:49.695 --> 18:54.267
Her doctor
already sent them.
Let me see.

18:54.300 --> 18:57.604
"Strep throat. Ear infections.
Yeast infections."

18:57.636 --> 19:01.807
None of my business.
No real info here.

19:01.840 --> 19:04.777
-Have you Googled her yet?
-Willow, she's 17.

19:04.810 --> 19:08.181
It's a search engine.
Look.

19:08.214 --> 19:11.851
Okay, let's see
what Cassie Newton pulls up.

19:11.884 --> 19:14.686
Hey, look. Check this.
She's got her own site.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.824
A day and a half of researching
and we finally try
looking up her.

19:17.856 --> 19:20.292
Wow. That's a lot of poems.

19:20.326 --> 19:23.996
Poems. Always a sign of
pretentious inner turmoil.

19:24.029 --> 19:29.501
"The sheets above me
cool my skin, like dirt
on a madwoman's grave.

19:29.536 --> 19:34.039
"I rise into the moonlight white
and watch the mirror stare.

19:34.073 --> 19:39.578
"The pale fish
looks back at me.
Pale fish will never swim.

19:39.612 --> 19:42.348
"My skin is milk
for no man to drink.

19:42.382 --> 19:47.487
"My thighs unused, unclenched.
This body is not ready yet.

19:47.519 --> 19:52.358
"But dirt waits for no woman,
and coins will buy no time.

19:52.392 --> 19:57.930
"I hear the chatter of the bugs.
It's they alone will feast."

19:57.963 --> 20:01.166
Okay. Death really is
on her brain.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.703
-We all deal with death.
-This girl isn't just dealing.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.939
She's giving death a long,
sloppy word-kiss.

20:06.972 --> 20:09.875
She has a yen for
the big dirt nap.
WILLOW: I don't know.

20:09.909 --> 20:14.012
I mean, a lot of teens
post some pretty angsty
poetry on the Web.

20:14.046 --> 20:19.018
I mean, I even posted
a melodramatic love poem
or two back in the day.

20:19.050 --> 20:22.555
-Love poems?
-I'm over you now, sweetie.

20:22.588 --> 20:28.094
-Love poems.
-Look, all I'm saying is that
this is normal teen stuff.

20:28.126 --> 20:31.029
You join chat rooms.
You write poetry.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.732
You post Doogie Howser
fan fic.

20:33.766 --> 20:37.537
It's all normal, right?
Let's see what other sites
there are.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.239
You guys are way off track.
I've got a hunch on this one.

20:40.272 --> 20:43.542
Oh, wait. No, here's something.
No, that's Phillip Newton.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.877
No, that's her dad.
Open it.

20:45.912 --> 20:50.317
Guys, I'm telling you.
I got this case
cracked wide open.

20:50.349 --> 20:53.152
I got the perp fingered.
I told you about
Mike Helgenburg, right?

20:53.184 --> 20:56.154
Uh, that's the guy
that asked her to the dance?
DAWN: Right.

20:56.188 --> 21:00.626
The one that keeps asking her
to the dance. I'm thinkin',
who likes to be rejected?

21:00.660 --> 21:04.564
Nobody. I'm thinkin',
some people can't handle
the rejection.

21:04.596 --> 21:08.067
-I'm thinkin'--
-Hey, I've got something. Oh.

21:08.099 --> 21:11.304
"Drunk and disorderly.
Disturbing the peace."

21:11.337 --> 21:14.272
-There's a lot of charges here.
-Her dad's a drunk?

21:14.307 --> 21:17.509
-A violent drunk?
-We better find out.

21:17.544 --> 21:21.012
I have his address
right... here.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.749
Got your keys?
Yeah.

21:22.781 --> 21:26.818
Guys, I'm telling you.
I'm liking Mike Helgenburg
for the perp.

21:26.853 --> 21:29.922
Let's collar him
before he... lawyers up.

21:29.955 --> 21:32.659
(Doorbell Chimes)

21:32.692 --> 21:36.095
(Sighs)
Buffy the Vampire Slayer
would break down this door.

21:36.127 --> 21:38.765
And Buffy the counselor?

21:38.798 --> 21:40.700
Waits.

21:42.233 --> 21:44.135
(Chimes)

21:47.574 --> 21:50.041
Mr. Newton?
That's right.

21:50.076 --> 21:53.380
I work at
your daughter's school.
I need to talk to you.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.851
So is she screwing up
her grades again?

21:58.884 --> 22:04.222
'Cause she's, uh,
not the sharpest apple
in the barrel.

22:04.256 --> 22:08.961
She's got some problems.
But it's, um, kind of you
we wanted to talk about.

22:08.994 --> 22:12.565
What about?
We know you've been picked up
by the police a couple of times.

22:12.598 --> 22:16.335
We wanted to know
if you still...

22:16.368 --> 22:19.538
-drink a lot.
-What's that got to do
with Cassie?

22:19.571 --> 22:23.910
Frankly, we were worried
that you might drink too much
and hurt Cassie.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.980
That's all.

22:28.013 --> 22:32.018
Oh. Well, I see.

22:32.050 --> 22:34.487
That's-That's all?

22:34.520 --> 22:38.356
You just come in here
in the middle of the night
into my home...

22:38.391 --> 22:41.894
and start accusing me
of beating on my daughter?

22:41.927 --> 22:44.663
-That's all?
-We just want to make sure
that Cassie's--

22:44.697 --> 22:48.267
Well, that's a lie.
Who told you this?

22:48.299 --> 22:53.038
Did Cassie's mother
put you up to this?
'Cause I pay my support, okay?

22:53.072 --> 22:55.340
To the dime.

22:55.374 --> 22:59.479
She just wants to take away
the one weekend a month
I get to be with my girl.

23:01.212 --> 23:04.683
-Which is when?
-What?

23:04.717 --> 23:09.087
-Which weekend is it?
-I just had her
last weekend.

23:10.722 --> 23:13.759
Look, I--

23:13.792 --> 23:17.529
I may not be the greatest dad
in the world,

23:17.564 --> 23:20.900
but I don't
beat up my daughter.

23:20.932 --> 23:25.037
So you won't be
seeing her this Friday then?

23:25.070 --> 23:29.275
(Sighs)
Not unless my ex-wife
gets a personality transplant.

23:29.307 --> 23:32.243
Okay.
Okay what?

23:32.278 --> 23:34.413
Okay, now you'll
get out of my house?

23:34.447 --> 23:37.415
Yeah. We will.

23:43.490 --> 23:47.960
(Alarm Chirps)
It's not him.

23:47.993 --> 23:49.796
He's not the one
who does it.

23:51.763 --> 23:57.002
Thank you for trying,
but I probably shouldn't have
told you anything.

23:57.036 --> 24:00.906
You're making such a big deal
out of it, and I want it
to all just go away.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.741
Are you talking about
killing yourself?

24:02.775 --> 24:05.144
CASSIE:
No. Of course not.
Then fight.

24:05.176 --> 24:08.013
Try.
There's no point.
I told you.

24:08.047 --> 24:10.348
This doesn't sound like someone
who really wants to live.

24:10.382 --> 24:13.786
You think I want this?
You think I don't care?

24:13.819 --> 24:18.590
Believe me,
I want to be here. Do things.

24:18.625 --> 24:21.693
I wanna graduate
from high school,

24:21.728 --> 24:25.196
and I wanna go to
the stupid winter formal.

24:25.230 --> 24:28.134
(Sniffles)
I have this friend,

24:28.166 --> 24:31.671
and it would be fun
to go with him.

24:31.703 --> 24:37.343
(Short Laugh)
Just to dance
and hear lame music.

24:37.375 --> 24:41.847
To wear a silly dress
and laugh and stuff.

24:41.881 --> 24:44.049
(Sniffs)

24:44.083 --> 24:48.688
I'd like to go.
There's a lot of stuff
I'd like to do.

24:49.855 --> 24:53.859
I'd love to ice skate
at Rockefeller Center.

24:53.893 --> 24:56.828
And I'd love to see
my cousins grow up
and see how they turn out...

24:56.863 --> 24:59.431
'cause they're really mean,
and I think
they're gonna be fat.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.237
I'd love to backpack
across the country or...

25:05.270 --> 25:08.974
I don't know,
fall in love.

25:09.008 --> 25:12.111
(Crying)
But I won't.

25:13.546 --> 25:16.848
-I just never will.
-You will.

25:16.883 --> 25:20.185
Cassie, you will.
You just have to
tell us what you know.

25:20.219 --> 25:23.088
You have to tell us everything.
Please, help us.

25:23.122 --> 25:25.657
I can't. I just know
it's gonna happen.

25:25.692 --> 25:28.560
I don't know why
and I don't know how,

25:28.595 --> 25:30.596
but something out there
is gonna kill me.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.767
(Chanting in Latin)

25:46.244 --> 25:49.448
(Chanting Continues)

26:13.338 --> 26:15.907
(Sighs)

26:20.246 --> 26:21.980
Hey, how we doing?
(Exhales)

26:22.013 --> 26:25.550
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.953
No, that's okay.
I just didn't
get much sleep last night.

26:27.987 --> 26:30.455
It's been a long week, huh?

26:30.489 --> 26:32.659
Well, thank God it's Friday.

26:32.692 --> 26:37.462
I can't believe
I just said that.
I'll see you later.

26:43.635 --> 26:46.305
"I sit alone at my windowsill.

26:46.337 --> 26:50.142
Trees crackle,
sunshine blares..."

26:50.175 --> 26:52.944
CASSIE
 "And children
 laugh like death.

26:52.979 --> 26:56.982
"Their sharp happiness
 is a knife to me.

26:57.016 --> 26:59.518
"One jealous snake
 on a windowsill.

27:03.454 --> 27:07.292
"They will be here,
 trees and sun...

27:07.326 --> 27:11.297
"and children with canes
 and pruney skin.

27:11.329 --> 27:14.866
"When I am but a memory,
 a laugh in the trees of time.

"I sit alone

"I sit alone

"I sit alone and laugh."

(Snapping)

28:03.715 --> 28:08.019
-Spike, what are you doing?
-Nothing.

28:10.056 --> 28:14.926
If I don't move,
if I don't think, if I don't
listen to the voices,

28:14.961 --> 28:18.497
then I won't hurt... much.

28:18.529 --> 28:21.901
-I need to ask you something.
-Don't.

28:21.933 --> 28:26.772
There's a girl. She's in danger,
and she needs your help now.

28:26.806 --> 28:32.010
Time is running out.
It's Friday. The day
Cassie said she's gonna die.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.246
I can't.
I can't hear you.

28:34.279 --> 28:37.849
Is there something evil
in the school?
Down here maybe?

28:37.884 --> 28:40.752
Spike, please,
do you know anything?

28:40.787 --> 28:42.721
(Sharp Exhale)

28:42.755 --> 28:44.655
Yes.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.427
There's evil.

28:50.628 --> 28:54.767
Down here.
Right here.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.505
I'm a bad man.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.109
William is a bad man.

29:05.944 --> 29:07.746
I hurt the girl.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.384
(Grunting)

29:13.419 --> 29:16.654
Spike, stop it!

29:16.688 --> 29:18.958
What did you do?
I hurt you, Buffy.

29:18.990 --> 29:22.493
And I will pay.
I am paying because
I hurt the girl.

29:24.029 --> 29:27.665
Spike. No.

29:27.699 --> 29:31.436
It's not me.
It's a different girl. Okay?

29:31.470 --> 29:33.839
Her name is Cassie Newton.

29:33.873 --> 29:37.977
Please, do you know
anything specific?

29:41.279 --> 29:43.481
(Sighs)

29:44.851 --> 29:46.751
Don't-Don't leave me.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.688
Stay here
and help me be quiet.

29:56.162 --> 29:58.964
I think it's worse
when I'm here.

30:02.567 --> 30:05.403
Don't let him
hurt the girl.

30:07.506 --> 30:09.540
WOOD:
Well, there's nothing
in this one.

30:09.575 --> 30:11.844
What do you got?

30:17.316 --> 30:20.385
-Where's your hall pass?
-No hall pass.
I got a free period.

30:20.419 --> 30:23.890
You seem kind of upset.
Something on your mind?
No. Not really.

30:23.923 --> 30:26.959
Well, I got a lousy "B"
in Egyptian history.

30:26.992 --> 30:29.461
I knew this stuff cold,
so that, you know,
that pisses me off.

30:29.494 --> 30:33.132
-You get pissed off a lot?
-No. I--

30:33.164 --> 30:36.234
Let me cut to the chase.
I hear you can't get a date
for the winter formal.

30:36.268 --> 30:42.673
Well, look, I know it's your job
to talk to kids with problems,
but, honestly, I don't have any.

30:42.708 --> 30:44.876
I'm fine.

30:44.911 --> 30:48.747
All right, look. It's really
no big deal. I have a friend
that I really wanted to take.

30:48.779 --> 30:53.818
I don't know. I guess
she doesn't see me that way.
She makes me crazy.

30:53.852 --> 30:57.923
-Crazy?
-Yeah. Sometimes I just--

30:59.691 --> 31:03.930
That's-That's funny.
You're Dawn's sister, right?

31:03.962 --> 31:07.699
Uh, that's right.
Dawn is my sister.

31:07.732 --> 31:10.836
That's so weird.
I was just thinking about her.

31:10.868 --> 31:15.874
Yeah, I was thinking
if Cassie won't budge,
maybe I'll ask Dawn.

31:15.907 --> 31:19.545
You aren't mad at Cassie
with her rejecting you
like that?

31:19.577 --> 31:23.950
(Chuckles)
Nah. She's a girl, right?

31:23.982 --> 31:26.451
Making boys crazy
is, like, your job description.

31:28.554 --> 31:33.491
You're asking
my sister to the dance
and she's your second choice?

31:35.394 --> 31:36.962
I'll be keeping an eye
on you.

31:43.469 --> 31:45.570
Seems like someone's got
quite a coin collection, huh?

31:52.144 --> 31:56.414
-You wanted to see me?
-You have locker number 281?

31:56.448 --> 31:58.817
Yeah, why?

31:58.849 --> 32:01.153
I want you to tell me
what this is...

32:01.186 --> 32:03.654
and what this has to do with
a girl named Cassie Newton?

32:03.689 --> 32:06.825
I don't know. I-It's late.
I'm gonna miss my bus.

32:06.857 --> 32:10.761
I know it's late.
That's why I don't
have time to mess around.

32:10.796 --> 32:12.999
So you need to talk to me now.

32:13.031 --> 32:18.369
Believe me, if I knew anything
I'd tell you. I just... don't.

32:21.307 --> 32:23.409
Do you know why
I came back to Sunnydale High?

32:23.442 --> 32:27.346
-To creep me out?
-To help.

32:27.378 --> 32:30.316
I'm a counselor here
because I wanna help.

32:30.348 --> 32:35.020
I know what it's like
to walk these halls
and feel lost, alone.

32:35.054 --> 32:39.157
I just wanna
make things better. Connect.

32:39.191 --> 32:43.694
And I'm going to connect with
your face if you don't stop
wasting my time...

32:43.729 --> 32:45.998
and help me do my job.

32:46.031 --> 32:49.101
I--Please.

32:49.134 --> 32:51.002
A girl could die.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.142
I guess I know who
you're talking about.

32:56.174 --> 32:58.609
She's some weirdo,
suicidal poet girl.

32:58.644 --> 33:02.647
These guys I know
wanna mess with her.
They've got this plan.

33:02.681 --> 33:06.551
-I guess this is good-bye.
-No. I mean,
let me walk you home.

33:06.585 --> 33:09.555
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'm going to my mom's.
It's kind of far.

33:09.587 --> 33:13.459
Far is good.
Dawn, I know
what's going on here.

33:13.491 --> 33:17.195
What?
Buffy told you
about me, right?

33:17.229 --> 33:20.165
She told you
to pretend to be my friend?
No.

33:20.199 --> 33:24.970
Maybe. Cassie, she was scared.
She wanted to help you.

33:25.002 --> 33:27.506
Well, she can't.
Maybe she can.

33:27.538 --> 33:32.810
She's not like you think.
She's got powers...
of helping and--

33:32.844 --> 33:36.548
Look, she was worried and now
I'm worried, and I wasn't
pretending at all.

33:36.582 --> 33:40.551
I really wanted to be
your friend.
(Laughs)

33:40.586 --> 33:43.855
You are my friend.
I am?

33:43.888 --> 33:47.326
Yeah. Just remember,
I'm not as dumb as I look.

33:47.358 --> 33:48.926
(Laughs)
I'm glad.

33:50.761 --> 33:53.499
Hey, Summers.

33:53.531 --> 33:58.670
Listen, Dawn,
whatever happens now
it's not your fault, okay?

33:58.703 --> 34:00.538
Summers.
What's up, Peter?

34:00.571 --> 34:04.041
I was just wondering
if anyone had asked you
to winter formal?

34:04.076 --> 34:08.347
What? Oh. Uh, no.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.014
Not exactly.

34:10.047 --> 34:12.483
Well, uh,
I was just doing a poll.

34:14.385 --> 34:17.556
(Laughs)
I'll see ya.

34:17.588 --> 34:18.956
That guy
is such an ass.

34:18.989 --> 34:21.059
Cassie?

34:23.628 --> 34:25.396
Cassie?

34:27.166 --> 34:30.536
Cassie?

34:30.568 --> 34:32.570
(Chanting In Latin)

34:37.443 --> 34:40.010
-All present?
-(Together)
All present.

34:50.789 --> 34:54.293
-Then we begin.
-(Snickering)

34:54.326 --> 34:56.061
Mandell, shut up.

34:56.094 --> 34:59.431
Sorry, dude.
It's just so cool.
I mean, we're gonna be rich.

34:59.465 --> 35:02.900
Keep your shorts, all right?
We have to do the ritual
if we wanna score.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.735
Okay.
(Clears Throat)

35:04.769 --> 35:06.771
O'Keefe, did you
take care of the fire exits?

35:06.804 --> 35:10.442
Yeah. Anybody tries to
bust in here's gonna get
a nasty surprise.

35:10.476 --> 35:13.978
I set up this booby trap
my cousin Ben
always used to do--

35:14.012 --> 35:17.382
-Then nobody is getting in.
-(Clears Throat)

35:23.289 --> 35:25.791
And nobody is getting out.

35:25.824 --> 35:28.659
(Gasps)
Dude.

35:31.230 --> 35:35.032
This is our sacrifice.
(Breathing Heavily)

35:38.637 --> 35:41.139
It's nothing personal.

35:41.172 --> 35:45.643
It's just that you have this
death-chick-suicidal vibe going.

35:45.677 --> 35:47.545
I figure if you disappear,

35:47.579 --> 35:50.815
everybody will just assume
you threw yourself
in a river somewhere.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.385
Extinguish.

35:58.257 --> 36:03.661
Almighty Avilas,
please accept our sacrifice.

36:03.695 --> 36:07.365
Please appear before us,
oh mighty soldier of the dark.

36:07.398 --> 36:11.302
Please appear before us
and grant us with
infinite riches...

36:11.336 --> 36:14.172
and we will pay you
with our sacrifice.

36:14.206 --> 36:17.141
We kneel before you
with the gift of flesh.

36:17.175 --> 36:21.980
Okay. That... is going on
your permanent record.

36:22.012 --> 36:25.451
-Wait, this is the counselor.
What is she doing here?
-It-It was his idea.

36:26.784 --> 36:29.755
Back off. Get back.

36:31.088 --> 36:33.858
Get back,
you stupid bitch.

36:35.626 --> 36:37.596
Oh, you're gonna die.

36:39.431 --> 36:41.932
Do you know how lame
this is?

36:41.967 --> 36:46.905
Bored teenage boys
trying to raise up a demon?
Sorry he didn't show.

36:46.938 --> 36:50.541
I bet it's 'cause you forgot
the boom box playing
some heavy metal thing...

36:50.576 --> 36:52.943
like Blue Clam Cult?

36:52.978 --> 36:56.882
I think that's the key
to the raising of lame demons.

37:00.619 --> 37:04.655
-That lame demon?
-(Growls)

37:19.804 --> 37:21.172
Dude, help.

37:36.086 --> 37:38.989
-No.
-(Grunts)

37:49.668 --> 37:52.771
Spike?
Here to help.
No hurting the girl.

37:52.804 --> 37:55.273
Untie her.
I'll take care of this.

38:07.619 --> 38:11.356
-Who are you?
-I'm a bad man.

38:16.494 --> 38:18.963
No, no. Please.

38:36.981 --> 38:38.650
(Cries Out)

38:41.820 --> 38:44.722
She'll tell you.

38:44.755 --> 38:46.324
Someday she'll tell you.

38:52.398 --> 38:54.199
Are you okay?
Uh-huh.

38:56.601 --> 39:00.005
(Cries)
Ow. Ow.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.842
You can't be dead.
(Gasps)

39:08.380 --> 39:11.650
-Where are my infinite riches?
-(Gasps)

39:11.682 --> 39:14.219
It bit me!

39:20.358 --> 39:22.226
Come on.

39:24.396 --> 39:27.065
Help. Help me, please.
I'm bleeding.

39:27.097 --> 39:30.702
Sorry. My office hours
are 10:00 to 4:00.

39:35.974 --> 39:40.978
It's all okay now.
I hope you're not
too disappointed.

39:46.617 --> 39:51.289
See? You can make a difference.

39:57.161 --> 39:59.264
And you will.

40:01.599 --> 40:05.036
Cassie. Cassie.

40:05.070 --> 40:08.106
Cassie. No.
Come on.

40:08.139 --> 40:11.510
Cassie. Cassie.

40:24.021 --> 40:25.791
How was her mom?

40:27.358 --> 40:29.260
Okay.

40:31.697 --> 40:33.664
As okay as--

40:36.166 --> 40:40.972
She told me their family
had a history of
heart irregularities.

40:43.340 --> 40:45.510
But she never told Cassie.

40:45.543 --> 40:51.849
Cassie didn't know?
Then it was fate?

40:51.882 --> 40:55.420
Then she was going to die
no matter what, wasn't she?

40:55.452 --> 40:57.322
It didn't matter
what you did.

40:57.355 --> 40:59.657
She just knew.

41:01.391 --> 41:05.764
She was special.
I failed her.

41:05.797 --> 41:09.333
Uh-uh. No.

41:10.835 --> 41:13.103
You didn't
'cause you tried.

41:13.137 --> 41:17.275
DAWN:
You listened
and you tried.

41:17.307 --> 41:20.846
She died 'cause of her heart,
not 'cause of you.

41:23.081 --> 41:25.349
She was my friend
'cause of you.

41:28.253 --> 41:31.822
I guess sometimes
you can't help.
(Sniffles)

41:31.856 --> 41:34.760
So what then?

41:37.161 --> 41:39.429
What do you do
when you know that?

41:42.099 --> 41:47.338
When you know that
maybe you can't help?

42:20.639 --> 42:23.240
(Theme music plays)

42:40.592 --> 42:42.427
Grr! Arrgh!
