00:15.375 --> 00:16.583
<i>Gina,</i>

00:17.625 --> 00:19.500
<i>why are you trying to hurt me?</i>

00:21.041 --> 00:22.291
<i>This is our home.</i>

00:23.958 --> 00:25.791
<i>Come back, please.</i>

00:27.416 --> 00:30.125
<i>We can make it right again.</i>
<i>If you come home.</i>

00:33.083 --> 00:34.833
<i>I don't know what Dylan told you,</i>

00:34.916 --> 00:38.500
<i>but you know all he ever tried to do</i>
<i>was break us up.</i>

00:47.791 --> 00:48.875
<i>If you keep running…</i>

00:51.500 --> 00:52.583
<i>with him,</i>

00:54.500 --> 00:55.958
<i>I can't help you.</i>

01:00.041 --> 01:01.708
<i>And you know it won't end well.</i>

01:03.375 --> 01:05.041
Why would you keep these secrets?

01:05.125 --> 01:06.875
Why would you hide this from me?

01:06.958 --> 01:09.458
"Sometimes I wish I wasn't a twin."

01:10.125 --> 01:12.208
"Sometimes I wish she were dead."

01:12.291 --> 01:14.916
"And sometimes I think
I could be the one to kill her."

01:15.000 --> 01:16.208
<i>Jesus, Gina.</i>

01:16.291 --> 01:18.666
-<i>It's not true.</i>
<i>-It is true. You wrote it down.</i>

01:19.375 --> 01:21.791
They're just thoughts.
They don't mean anything.

01:25.708 --> 01:28.208
Dylan, it's me, Leni.

01:28.291 --> 01:29.875
Why haven't you called me back?

01:30.833 --> 01:32.041
Gina needs us.

01:32.125 --> 01:35.708
She's angry and I don't know why.
But I do know what she can do.

01:39.083 --> 01:42.291
<i>You betrayed me and told Dylan about us.</i>

01:44.166 --> 01:46.041
<i>Well, I told him about you.</i>

01:46.875 --> 01:48.791
<i>He doesn't want you.</i>

01:52.500 --> 01:54.291
<i>How could you do this to me?</i>

01:55.416 --> 01:58.708
<i>I miss you. I'm scared.</i>

02:14.250 --> 02:17.916
<i>I'd do anything for you, Gina.</i>
<i>You know that.</i>

02:20.208 --> 02:21.291
<i>Don't you?</i>

02:33.458 --> 02:36.416
<i>Hey, Mattie.</i>
<i>Hello!</i>

02:43.166 --> 02:44.000
<i>Yay.</i>

02:50.125 --> 02:52.083
Can't keep secrets from each other.

02:52.166 --> 02:55.125
So there's nothing
you haven't told me? Ever?

02:55.208 --> 02:56.041
Of course not.

02:56.125 --> 02:57.375
Not even about Jack?

02:57.458 --> 02:58.875
Nothing happened.

02:58.958 --> 03:00.791
But you didn't say anything.

03:06.041 --> 03:07.083
You're right.

03:07.791 --> 03:09.458
From now on we share this.

03:10.791 --> 03:11.666
One book.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.458
We can keep secrets from each other.

03:15.250 --> 03:16.916
But not the book.

03:45.750 --> 03:47.833
<i>I was with your Auntie Gina.</i>

03:48.958 --> 03:50.416
A little bit of sister time

03:50.500 --> 03:52.250
'cause we won't have our trip this year.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.333
Is Auntie Gina coming back here?

03:54.916 --> 03:56.083
Uh, we'll see, love.

03:57.625 --> 04:01.166
Here. We got berry face.

04:02.875 --> 04:06.125
We do them with chocolate chips
now, remember?

04:09.041 --> 04:10.875
-Morning.
-Morning.

04:10.958 --> 04:12.208
-Morning, pal.
-Morning.

04:12.291 --> 04:13.125
How you doing?

04:13.208 --> 04:16.625
Bacon's up. I got eggs on the way.

04:17.125 --> 04:18.541
Just a cup of coffee for me.

04:18.625 --> 04:21.250
-They're fresh from down the road.
-Just coffee. Thanks.

04:22.500 --> 04:23.958
All right. Um…

04:29.291 --> 04:31.125
Why don't you eat your breakfast? Huh?

04:33.125 --> 04:36.416
Hey, everything's okay.
All right? Mommy's home.

04:38.833 --> 04:40.791
And I'm never leaving again. I promise.

04:44.833 --> 04:45.916
Here you go, sweetie.

04:50.875 --> 04:51.958
Morning, all.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.083
Victor.

04:53.166 --> 04:54.541
Happy birthday, Len.

04:54.625 --> 04:57.083
Dad. Thank you.

05:01.166 --> 05:03.958
-Oh, morning, little beauty.
-Hi, Granddad.

05:04.583 --> 05:06.041
Hey, where's your Aunt Gina?

05:06.125 --> 05:08.541
Uh, resting at the Riverside.

05:08.625 --> 05:12.208
I think she's a little overwhelmed
with everything that's been going on.

05:12.291 --> 05:14.833
Well, we'll get her back
in the swing of things.

05:14.916 --> 05:15.875
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

05:15.958 --> 05:18.083
Claudia and I have been
hard at work this morning.

05:18.166 --> 05:19.500
Yeah? At what?

05:20.583 --> 05:22.000
Your birthday party.

05:22.666 --> 05:24.958
-Tonight at our place.
-What?

05:25.041 --> 05:27.083
We got the lights
in the backyard working.

05:27.166 --> 05:29.750
We've been on with Liss and Meg
and they called everyone.

05:29.833 --> 05:30.750
Wait, Meg?

05:30.833 --> 05:32.625
I don't think tonight's a great time…

05:32.708 --> 05:36.541
No. No, it's no trouble.
I know that you prefer your fancy trips

05:36.625 --> 05:40.583
and Claudia and I are always happy
to have time with little Mathilda,

05:40.666 --> 05:44.125
but, uh, this year, I have all my girls.

05:45.208 --> 05:47.875
And Mount Echo has shown you
what you mean to them.

05:48.541 --> 05:52.625
And the family. So we invited everyone.

05:54.083 --> 05:55.208
Like the whole town?

05:55.291 --> 05:57.208
Well, they came out for you once before.

05:58.291 --> 06:01.000
What do you say, Mattie?
You fancy a party?

06:01.083 --> 06:04.291
Yes, Granddad. Will there be ice cream?

06:04.375 --> 06:06.083
Ice cream. Ice cream…

06:06.166 --> 06:08.083
-For you, whatever you want.

06:08.166 --> 06:11.583
Yeah, honestly, Dad, I don't know
if Gina will be able to make it.

06:11.666 --> 06:14.208
She's still resting
and I know she has to get back…

06:14.291 --> 06:15.916
She can fly tomorrow.

06:17.250 --> 06:20.208
Tonight we're together as a family. Yes?

06:20.291 --> 06:21.166
Yeah.

06:24.041 --> 06:25.125
See you then, Victor.

06:25.958 --> 06:27.333
Thanks for the coffee, Len.

06:27.958 --> 06:29.500
-Bye, sweetheart.
-Bye.

06:30.583 --> 06:33.500
Why don't I make you
some breakfast, Dad? Yeah?

06:34.166 --> 06:35.000
Um…

06:35.500 --> 06:36.375
Got eggs up.

06:39.083 --> 06:40.291
Shit. Um…

06:42.750 --> 06:43.916
I'll make new.

06:52.583 --> 06:53.833
Oh, you're here.

06:53.916 --> 06:55.500
It's Thursday.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.000
So it is.

06:58.083 --> 07:01.291
Do you not need me to watch her
this morning? Take her school?

07:02.041 --> 07:03.041
Oh.

07:03.125 --> 07:07.875
Wait, were you gonna skip your routine
and have, like, a bonding thing with her?

07:07.958 --> 07:09.291
'Cause you got lost on your hike?

07:10.041 --> 07:12.791
You know, I…
I don't think I'm gonna need you today.

07:12.875 --> 07:15.083
Okay. From what Mattie says,

07:15.833 --> 07:18.208
you'll probably need
some time together anyway.

07:20.208 --> 07:22.333
Yeah. What did Mattie say exactly?

07:22.416 --> 07:27.000
Just that she knows your mind
is in a different place lately

07:27.083 --> 07:29.333
and that you have
some new friends you see.

07:30.583 --> 07:31.416
Yeah.

07:32.083 --> 07:37.583
You know, maybe, uh, I'll get you
to stay for at least the morning.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.625
You know… You do know where to
find me in case my phone dies, right?

07:43.208 --> 07:44.541
I assume the Echo Echo?

07:46.250 --> 07:48.125
That's it. Right.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.125
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:15.916 --> 08:17.416
-Hey.
-I, uh…

08:18.500 --> 08:22.333
I wasn't sure if we would be back on.
I thought about calling, but, you know…

08:22.416 --> 08:24.375
What you said about Jack and everything.

08:24.458 --> 08:25.791
I said about Jack?

08:25.875 --> 08:27.250
What can I get y'all?

08:27.333 --> 08:29.875
Just coffee, please.

08:29.958 --> 08:32.541
What? Back to not eating again?

08:32.625 --> 08:34.291
Not after everything you've been through.

08:34.375 --> 08:35.583
Just bring her her usual.

08:35.666 --> 08:37.291
-Thank you.
-Sure thing.

08:38.458 --> 08:40.541
Uh, deputy… Uh, Paula.

08:41.916 --> 08:44.666
What you said yesterday about Floss,

08:44.750 --> 08:46.708
about the pictures in the cold case files.

08:46.791 --> 08:48.625
Yeah. It was the church fire, I guess?
Huh?

08:48.708 --> 08:50.250
Yeah, from our teen years.

08:50.333 --> 08:53.416
Got me thinking about memories,
you know, and, uh,

08:53.500 --> 08:56.625
wondering why Floss thinks
it might be connected.

08:56.708 --> 09:00.125
Well, she spent yesterday afternoon
talking to Meg Jenkins about it.

09:03.958 --> 09:05.166
Meg. Huh.

09:06.625 --> 09:08.791
I wonder why she'd wanna talk to Meg.

09:08.875 --> 09:11.166
I'm not sure, but that guy?

09:11.916 --> 09:13.125
Yeah, he's gone missing

09:13.208 --> 09:15.708
and Floss wants to
talk to him about the fire.

09:23.916 --> 09:25.041
So, uh…

09:25.875 --> 09:29.958
your dad told me that he convinced Meg
to come to the party tonight.

09:30.041 --> 09:31.916
You already know about the party?

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Yeah, the whole town's gonna turn up.

09:34.583 --> 09:36.416
I hope I get to know Gina a bit better.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.625
Yeah. She's…
Well, she's like you, but not.

09:42.791 --> 09:43.875
Right?

09:45.250 --> 09:46.083
Right.

10:11.291 --> 10:13.250
Gina! Hi.

10:13.791 --> 10:16.375
Hey, um, Meg.
Thanks so much for seeing me.

10:16.458 --> 10:17.833
-Sure.
-Thank you.

10:20.166 --> 10:21.500
Uh, please.

10:22.250 --> 10:23.083
Thank you.

10:27.583 --> 10:31.208
So you want to talk about Leni.

10:32.416 --> 10:34.041
If that's all right with you?

10:38.125 --> 10:40.750
It all started when
my cousin came back to town.

10:41.375 --> 10:42.291
Your cousin?

10:43.791 --> 10:45.083
-Dylan.

10:46.666 --> 10:49.583
I told him a small town never forgets.

10:50.291 --> 10:52.875
But he insisted on coming back.

10:53.958 --> 10:56.000
Leni didn't tell you? About Dylan.

10:56.083 --> 10:57.916
Uh, no.

10:59.333 --> 11:00.833
She threatened me.

11:01.625 --> 11:04.041
She threatened you? With what?

11:04.666 --> 11:05.875
I'd rather not say.

11:08.500 --> 11:11.833
But it would have
meant the end of my life.

11:12.708 --> 11:13.666
I'm so sorry.

11:14.208 --> 11:16.791
Did you talk to Dylan about it all?

11:16.875 --> 11:17.708
No.

11:18.541 --> 11:21.166
Except, he kept asking me to go over

11:21.916 --> 11:24.708
what I remember about
that night the old church burned.

11:26.291 --> 11:27.625
What about that night?

11:27.708 --> 11:31.083
I told him. I don't remember much.

11:33.083 --> 11:35.000
Did he ask about anything else?

11:35.583 --> 11:36.625
The oddest thing.

11:36.708 --> 11:40.750
He asked me about how Claudia got hurt.

11:42.291 --> 11:44.541
Which was years before
his time, of course.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Good morning.

12:26.083 --> 12:28.000
Well, I'll be damned.

12:28.708 --> 12:30.458
Are you that one or the other one?

12:30.541 --> 12:32.375
It's Leni, Mrs. Taylor.

12:32.458 --> 12:34.500
Oh, look at you, Leni.

12:34.583 --> 12:37.291
You were lost and now you're found.

12:37.375 --> 12:39.041
-Yes.
-Well, come in.

12:40.166 --> 12:42.541
It is good to see you.

12:42.625 --> 12:44.916
-It's been a bit of time, hasn't it?
-It has.

12:45.000 --> 12:45.875
Uh-huh.

12:45.958 --> 12:48.208
Yeah, I've been trying
to remember how long.

12:48.291 --> 12:50.041
Oh, a decade, I'd say.

12:50.750 --> 12:51.625
Yes.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.125
Get you a cup of tea?

12:56.708 --> 12:58.541
No, thank you. Uh…

12:58.625 --> 13:00.916
I can't stay. I just heard that, maybe…

13:01.458 --> 13:05.375
that, uh, Dylan might be back in town.

13:06.416 --> 13:09.250
He was away for a while, you know.

13:09.333 --> 13:14.333
But now that's all behind him.
And I do get to see him. Some days.

13:14.416 --> 13:15.916
It does an old woman good.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.666
Yes. Yes.

13:18.250 --> 13:19.166
Um…

13:19.250 --> 13:22.708
Do you know where
I might be able to find him?

13:25.041 --> 13:27.833
I don't know exactly where he is.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.708
-A free spirit, that one.
-Hmm.

13:30.791 --> 13:32.708
Still and all, after everything.

13:32.791 --> 13:33.750
Yeah.

13:34.375 --> 13:36.375
I'm curious. Did he ever, um,

13:38.166 --> 13:41.666
talk to you about
that fire from back when?

13:42.375 --> 13:45.000
No, not specifically.

13:45.083 --> 13:49.708
He was working through
some anger about the past.

13:52.208 --> 13:54.666
But I know he'd love to see you.

13:54.750 --> 13:59.125
If he checks in,
should I have him call you at the farm?

13:59.208 --> 14:02.291
Yes, Mrs. Taylor, please. Thank you.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.666
Now, I'm going to see myself out,

14:05.500 --> 14:08.250
but it really was good to see you.

14:08.333 --> 14:10.583
Well, and you, dear.

14:10.666 --> 14:11.625
Thank you.

14:40.416 --> 14:42.208
Who the hell would move here?

15:03.791 --> 15:04.666
Is she okay?

15:05.500 --> 15:07.416
It was her idea to come over here.

15:12.541 --> 15:14.750
Did you catch what she said
about that boy moving in?

15:14.833 --> 15:15.708
Mmm-hmm.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.041
Never knew she hated this town so much.

15:19.125 --> 15:21.083
She wants to go to college out west.

15:22.166 --> 15:23.875
Los Angeles or something.

15:26.333 --> 15:28.583
You would never leave this place,
would you?

15:29.333 --> 15:31.125
Not unless I get a better offer.

15:35.875 --> 15:36.791
<i>Charlie,</i>

15:37.833 --> 15:39.458
you must be in back-to-back sessions.

15:39.541 --> 15:41.750
I've tried you a few times and… Voicemail.

15:42.583 --> 15:45.291
Um, everything's fine here.
I wanted you to know that

15:45.375 --> 15:51.750
I'm probably going to stay another day
or two just to make sure Leni is settled.

15:56.833 --> 15:59.250
I have another call.
I'm going to call you later.

16:03.416 --> 16:04.791
Hello, this is Gina.

16:05.291 --> 16:06.500
<i>Hi. Gina McCleary?</i>

16:07.166 --> 16:08.583
-Yes, it is.
<i>-Hi, Gina.</i>

16:08.666 --> 16:11.791
<i>This is Kyle from United National Bank</i>
<i>here in Los Angeles.</i>

16:11.875 --> 16:14.083
<i>I'm just calling to confirm your transfer.</i>

16:14.791 --> 16:20.083
<i>We have 60,000 cash to be picked up today</i>
<i>at United National Bank of Mount Echo.</i>

16:20.166 --> 16:21.375
<i>Uh, is that correct?</i>

16:21.458 --> 16:23.000
Yes, I'd like to confirm that.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.541
<i>Great. I just need</i>
<i>the last four of your social</i>

16:25.625 --> 16:27.500
<i>and your mother's maiden name.</i>

16:27.583 --> 16:31.583
Sure. The last four digits are 4224.

16:31.666 --> 16:34.416
Mother's maiden name is Czerny.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.375
<i>-Okay.</i>
-Uh…

16:35.458 --> 16:37.416
I'm sorry, could you please make a note

16:38.208 --> 16:41.250
that I won't be able
to pick it up before30?

16:42.791 --> 16:46.291
Um, is that possible
to hold the transfer until then?

16:46.375 --> 16:47.875
<i>Um, yeah, sure.</i>

16:47.958 --> 16:50.083
<i>Sorry.</i>
<i>I'm just neurotic about tech things.</i>

16:50.166 --> 16:53.375
<i>No, understood. I can schedule it</i>
<i>to go a few minutes before that.</i>

16:53.458 --> 16:55.666
<i>It won't arrive in any earlier than30.</i>

16:56.458 --> 16:58.375
<i>Great. Thank you.</i>

17:07.791 --> 17:10.083
Hey, Claud. What do you need?

17:10.166 --> 17:12.708
<i>I need you to stop at the bakery</i>
<i>at the general store.</i>

17:12.791 --> 17:14.750
<i>They've got a custom sheet cake for us.</i>

17:14.833 --> 17:16.375
Uh, I'll swing by later.

17:16.458 --> 17:18.041
<i>Negative. I need you to go right away.</i>

17:18.125 --> 17:20.250
<i>The baker leaves at30. Apparently--</i>

17:20.333 --> 17:23.125
Claud, I got a lot of things
I need to do right now. So…

17:23.208 --> 17:25.958
<i>Fine. I suppose</i>
<i>I'll try Gina at the Riverside.</i>

17:26.041 --> 17:30.208
No! Uh, no,
you better not go picking a fight. Uh…

17:30.291 --> 17:31.208
<i>I won't.</i>

17:31.291 --> 17:33.583
I'll pick up the cake, Claud.
All right? Uh…

17:34.708 --> 17:36.708
-I'll see you later.
<i>-Thank you. Bye.</i>

17:42.875 --> 17:43.916
I declare.

17:44.791 --> 17:46.916
If it isn't the miracle woman herself.

17:47.708 --> 17:49.916
Sheriff. Hello.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.916
What a happy accident.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.458
Yeah, just picking up
something for my sister.

17:54.541 --> 17:57.333
Mmm. For the big party tonight. Right?

17:57.833 --> 18:00.583
I was just so touched to get the invite.

18:00.666 --> 18:03.000
Most people don't love
having the law around

18:03.083 --> 18:06.458
when they're having a rager,
but your father, he is a good man.

18:06.541 --> 18:09.166
Yeah, he is a good man. Good to see you.

18:09.250 --> 18:14.875
Oh, I imagine that you'd like an update
on our search for your horse thieves.

18:14.958 --> 18:20.125
Turns out… Now your foal
had markings on his left flank.

18:20.208 --> 18:22.958
Matches the foal that
was stolen one state over.

18:23.041 --> 18:28.208
Now look, I know that you and Jack
aren't in the business of stealing horses,

18:28.291 --> 18:30.416
but, uh, I know about the loans.

18:31.916 --> 18:35.833
I'm sorry, should we be having
our lawyer here for this discussion?

18:35.916 --> 18:40.416
Of course not. I… I just want you
to know that I know how hard it can be.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.166
Yeah. Well, I am running late.

18:44.250 --> 18:46.375
I look forward to seeing you at the party.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.041
And your sister. In the same place.

18:49.125 --> 18:50.333
How about that?

18:52.833 --> 18:55.458
<i>They promised</i>
<i>it would look exactly like the picture.</i>

18:56.041 --> 18:56.916
Here you go.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.541
It does, Claud,
but Gina wasn't in that photo.

19:00.625 --> 19:02.541
<i>I don't have a photo of Gina.</i>

19:02.625 --> 19:04.708
Well, it's her birthday too, sis.

19:04.791 --> 19:07.250
<i>And the filling. Make sure it's raspberry.</i>

19:07.333 --> 19:09.125
Claudia, can we wrap this up?

19:10.458 --> 19:12.041
I've got some errands to run.

20:36.708 --> 20:37.916
Back already?

20:42.291 --> 20:43.125
Hi.

20:43.208 --> 20:44.250
You have your ID?

20:45.250 --> 20:47.416
Uh, yeah. Um…

20:48.500 --> 20:51.458
Yeah, it turns out
it was in my back pocket. So…

20:58.041 --> 21:00.750
If it's up to date,
we can fudge a month at the most.

21:00.833 --> 21:02.625
But your last one was over a year…

21:06.791 --> 21:07.708
Perfect.

21:08.750 --> 21:10.333
How would you like the funds?

21:10.416 --> 21:11.250
Oh…

21:12.291 --> 21:13.791
Uh, in a cashier's check?

21:34.666 --> 21:35.916
What about Gina?

21:38.583 --> 21:39.916
I'll take care of Gina.

21:43.083 --> 21:44.250
We'll make it okay.

21:58.875 --> 22:00.666
What the fuck is this doing in our room?

22:00.750 --> 22:02.166
In your bed, Leni.

22:02.250 --> 22:03.541
I must have left it some time.

22:03.625 --> 22:05.375
When? When were you upstairs?

22:05.458 --> 22:08.208
I borrowed it.
For the crafts fair for physical science.

22:08.291 --> 22:10.708
-I must've forgotten to return it.
-Bullshit.

22:10.791 --> 22:12.625
We use Dad's razor blades, not this.

22:12.708 --> 22:15.708
<i>I went looking for the diary</i>
<i>and I moved the bed and this fell out.</i>

22:15.791 --> 22:18.000
<i>Is that why you forgot to return it?</i>

22:18.083 --> 22:19.416
I thought we were the same.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.875
Are we the same when you're with him?

22:24.625 --> 22:26.000
Gina, it's my fault.

22:26.083 --> 22:29.166
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

22:29.708 --> 22:30.541
-Gina.
-Look, I…

22:30.625 --> 22:32.750
It's not your fault at all, Jack.

22:32.833 --> 22:33.875
It's mine.

22:34.541 --> 22:37.708
We are not the same
and we never will be again.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.916
I'm sorry. We didn't mean to.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.166
So it was just an accident then?

22:59.250 --> 23:02.583
You fell up into the hayloft
and there he was, accidentally naked.

23:04.083 --> 23:09.375
Gina, there's nothing
I have that I won't give you.

23:09.958 --> 23:12.958
There's nothing you could ever need
that I won't get for you.

23:13.666 --> 23:14.791
Two as one.

23:16.291 --> 23:17.250
Always.

23:19.625 --> 23:20.666
Okay, Gina?

24:10.166 --> 24:12.000
You have some fucking nerve being here.

24:12.083 --> 24:13.291
I've got some nerve?

24:13.375 --> 24:15.541
-Where's Gina? You lied to me.
-You're a thief.

24:15.625 --> 24:17.458
You said you were gonna help me with her.

24:17.541 --> 24:18.916
You took our stuff. Give it back.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.416
The passports, the tickets, the money.
All of it.

24:21.500 --> 24:23.958
You think that you're helping her,
but you're not.

24:24.041 --> 24:26.791
She's going to turn on you.
That is what she does.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.666
She's using you, Dylan.

24:28.750 --> 24:29.958
Oh, she's using me?

24:30.958 --> 24:33.583
You know damn well
you're the user around here.

24:33.666 --> 24:36.625
You've been using Gina
your whole fucking life.

24:38.041 --> 24:43.125
Now, I'm pretty sure that's something
Jack might want to hear. Huh?

24:44.958 --> 24:46.083
All these years.

24:47.750 --> 24:48.958
The lies.

24:51.375 --> 24:52.375
The switching.

24:55.791 --> 24:59.250
At least he would like to know
that you snuck out to see me yesterday.

24:59.333 --> 25:01.000
Are you sure you want to do that?

25:01.583 --> 25:04.750
What happens when Floss hauls
your ass in for stealing horses, huh?

25:04.833 --> 25:06.666
How's that going to help her, Dylan?

25:06.750 --> 25:08.041
-Hmm?
-Mmm-hmm.

25:09.333 --> 25:10.708
I'll fucking tell you what.

25:11.333 --> 25:13.500
You bring her back and this all goes away.

25:14.041 --> 25:16.625
If it doesn't, you're fucking
going down for manslaughter

25:16.708 --> 25:18.000
and she comes back to me.

25:29.291 --> 25:31.291
-Gina's not coming back.
-No.

25:32.500 --> 25:33.500
Gina's done.

25:33.583 --> 25:35.541
You've always had a blind spot for her.

25:36.708 --> 25:38.208
But she ain't had one for you.

25:39.791 --> 25:43.333
You're fucking temporary
and I'm begging you to know that.

25:44.916 --> 25:46.041
Get off my property.

25:48.583 --> 25:51.541
<i>Gina, that Dylan boy</i>
<i>is here again.</i>

25:57.458 --> 26:01.041
I thought we'd take the bike up
those switchbacks. Up Mount Eden Road.

26:01.125 --> 26:02.041
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah?

26:08.458 --> 26:09.416
Gina!

26:16.833 --> 26:19.791
Do you love him? What about Jack?

26:20.291 --> 26:21.375
You have Jack.

26:22.041 --> 26:24.041
But you love him too. Don't you?

26:24.125 --> 26:25.291
You have Jack.

26:25.375 --> 26:26.625
I don't care about Jack.

26:28.333 --> 26:29.958
I care about you.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.125
What's mine is yours.

26:33.666 --> 26:37.083
And what's yours is mine. Including Jack.

27:57.833 --> 27:59.333
-What are you doing?
-Oh.

28:00.541 --> 28:04.041
I'm looking for, uh, whatever it is
that Floss is going to find anyway.

28:04.916 --> 28:07.250
If there were anything to find,
you won't find it there.

28:07.333 --> 28:12.416
We have to give her something. Anything.
To save ourselves, this place.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.208
-To save ourselves?
-Yes.

28:15.166 --> 28:17.000
Or to save you and your boyfriend?

28:17.916 --> 28:19.791
What the hell? Jack?

28:25.500 --> 28:26.791
Hello, it's Leni.

28:26.875 --> 28:29.666
<i>I would have thought</i>
<i>you'd taken the Royal Suite.</i>

28:30.500 --> 28:33.791
Gina. Hi, love.

28:35.041 --> 28:36.125
How'd you sleep?

28:36.208 --> 28:39.708
<i>And I can't believe you brought</i>
<i>three pairs of Jimmy Choo's.</i>

28:39.791 --> 28:42.041
<i>-Are we really that LA?</i>
-Mmm-hmm.

28:42.125 --> 28:45.375
<i>But no cashier's check. No passports.</i>

28:46.250 --> 28:48.333
<i>I should've known</i>
<i>you wouldn't leave them here.</i>

28:48.416 --> 28:51.250
Yeah. I know.

28:52.083 --> 28:54.166
Yeah. I'll see you soon.

28:56.958 --> 28:58.708
This is to be continued, okay?

29:00.333 --> 29:02.916
-She needs me at the Riverside.
-Of course she does.

30:25.875 --> 30:27.916
Happy birthday!

30:28.916 --> 30:29.750
Dad.

30:29.833 --> 30:31.083
Happy birthday, Leni!

30:31.166 --> 30:33.416
Oh, happiest of happiest, my love.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.166
-Thank you for doing this.
-Mmm.

30:35.666 --> 30:36.625
Mmm.

30:37.250 --> 30:38.291
Have you seen Gina?

30:38.375 --> 30:40.750
Yeah, she's out back. She asked after you.

30:41.333 --> 30:42.833
Right. I'm gonna find her.

30:43.541 --> 30:46.541
Hey, bring her in.
All my girls together.

30:49.083 --> 30:50.250
Happy birthday.

30:50.333 --> 30:51.208
Thank you.

31:10.166 --> 31:13.958
Ooh, Leni! Many happy returns.

31:14.875 --> 31:15.791
Sheriff.

31:16.666 --> 31:17.625
Huh.

31:17.708 --> 31:19.625
-Quite the turnout, isn't it?
-Mmm.

31:20.125 --> 31:24.041
But, I'm surprised to learn
that I don't know some of your guests.

31:24.125 --> 31:25.500
Really? Well…

31:26.291 --> 31:31.500
Now, take those two
horsey-looking fellows over by the buffet.

31:32.500 --> 31:36.708
Horsey-looking in terms of,
you know, working with horses.

31:36.791 --> 31:39.250
Not, uh, long face,
big teeth, that sort of thing…

31:39.333 --> 31:40.583
Anyway. Friends of yours?

31:42.458 --> 31:45.583
Uh, no. No.

31:45.666 --> 31:48.750
No. Not friends of mine.
Maybe, uh, clients of the vet.

31:48.833 --> 31:49.666
Hmm. Mmm-hmm.

31:49.750 --> 31:51.583
Shame. Maybe I'll go introduce myself.

31:51.666 --> 31:56.583
Uh, you know what? I tried to throw
a smile at them across the buffet,

31:56.666 --> 31:58.166
they didn't seem too friendly.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.458
-Sometimes they can sense a badge.
-Mmm.

32:01.208 --> 32:02.291
Happy birthday, love.

32:04.208 --> 32:05.666
Thank you so much for coming.

32:05.750 --> 32:08.208
Oh, of course, Jack, I wouldn't miss this.

32:08.291 --> 32:10.875
Both the sisters at the same party.

32:10.958 --> 32:12.208
Now that's legendary.

32:12.291 --> 32:17.833
Leni and I were just
discussing your variety of guests.

32:17.916 --> 32:19.291
-Yes, excuse me.
-Yeah.

32:19.375 --> 32:22.125
Sweetheart, I was hoping
we could have a private moment.

32:22.208 --> 32:23.333
On your birthday.

32:23.916 --> 32:25.958
Yes, I'd love that. But, uh…

32:26.041 --> 32:29.208
You know what? Let me go say hi to,
uh, Gina, for a second.

32:29.291 --> 32:31.958
Can you believe it? I haven't
wished her a happy birthday yet.

32:32.041 --> 32:32.916
All right.

32:38.333 --> 32:40.666
Leni. Happy birthday.

32:41.166 --> 32:43.375
Charlie. What a surprise.

32:45.458 --> 32:46.416
Hello, love.

32:46.500 --> 32:47.958
Happy birthday.

32:49.041 --> 32:49.958
Charlie's here.

32:50.041 --> 32:51.291
I couldn't stay away.

32:51.375 --> 32:54.541
Not after everything that's happened.
And I know Gina's full of feelings.

32:54.625 --> 32:58.083
I'm just so glad Leni's safe
and we could be together on our birthday.

32:58.791 --> 32:59.625
Truly blessed.

33:00.208 --> 33:04.375
We're all blessed to have you back safely
and to celebrate the birthday together.

33:04.458 --> 33:05.416
Couldn't miss it.

33:05.500 --> 33:09.500
Yeah. I'm sure Gina's been keeping you
abreast of everything that's going on.

33:09.583 --> 33:11.833
Hey, let's get a twin photo then? Huh?

33:11.916 --> 33:12.875
Come on, girls.

33:13.916 --> 33:15.333
Let's find Claudia.

33:16.208 --> 33:18.625
-I think she'll want to be a part of this.
-Gina.

33:18.708 --> 33:19.625
Back in a flash.

33:19.708 --> 33:21.458
-Love it. Flash.
-Wait…

33:21.541 --> 33:24.916
I'm, uh, so glad that you're well, Leni.

33:25.875 --> 33:28.291
Just a really nasty business, sounds like.

33:28.375 --> 33:30.583
-Yeah, it's been quite an ordeal. Yeah.
-Mmm.

33:30.666 --> 33:32.291
Those cuts look like they're healing.

33:32.375 --> 33:33.958
-Yeah.
-How about the shoulder?

33:34.041 --> 33:36.083
-You fell on the left? The right?
-The right.

33:36.166 --> 33:37.208
-Oh.

33:37.291 --> 33:39.541
-It's not too sore. Mmm-hmm.
-That's good.

33:39.625 --> 33:42.125
You must be so tired.
You've been juggling a lot lately.

33:42.208 --> 33:43.041
Charlie.

33:43.583 --> 33:45.416
I heard Leni was out front
with a newcomer.

33:45.500 --> 33:47.583
That would be me. How are you, Jack?

33:47.666 --> 33:49.041
Better than ever, Charlie.

33:49.125 --> 33:50.750
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you.

33:50.833 --> 33:53.208
Now, I was just realizing it's been years,

33:53.291 --> 33:54.875
since I've been here on Mount Echo.

33:54.958 --> 33:57.708
I just forget
how beautiful the country really is.

33:57.791 --> 34:01.000
And this estate.
It's really exquisite. So well kept.

34:01.083 --> 34:03.000
Well, we do what we can.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.041
Yeah.

34:04.125 --> 34:07.833
I'm glad that Gina and I
were able to help out, by the way.

34:07.916 --> 34:09.166
I want you both to know that

34:09.250 --> 34:12.083
we are here to help
if you need anything at all.

34:12.166 --> 34:14.833
Are you sure $60,000 is enough?
We can access more.

34:15.583 --> 34:16.750
Truly. It's no trouble.

34:16.833 --> 34:18.708
It's more than enough. Thank you.

34:20.791 --> 34:23.458
Forgive me.
I'm… I'm still catching up, it seems.

34:24.708 --> 34:26.666
I think I should seek out a refill.

34:26.750 --> 34:28.708
I hear the lager is back by the buffet.

34:28.791 --> 34:29.625
-Yeah.
-So, uh…

34:29.708 --> 34:32.250
I'm gonna go track that down.
And Gina, of course.

34:32.333 --> 34:33.166
Of course.

34:33.250 --> 34:34.875
And we'll see you guys for cake.

34:34.958 --> 34:35.958
-All right.
-Great.

34:39.291 --> 34:41.041
What $60,000, Leni?

34:42.208 --> 34:44.125
-You asked for money?
-Can this wait?

34:44.208 --> 34:46.291
-We're going to talk now.
-I'm gonna find Gina.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.333
Leni. Leni!

34:50.541 --> 34:51.500
God damn it!

34:52.000 --> 34:53.250
What did you do with that money?

34:53.333 --> 34:54.958
Jack. Please.

34:55.041 --> 34:57.041
What did you tell him to get $60,000?

34:57.125 --> 34:58.958
-And where is it?
-This is not the place.

34:59.625 --> 35:02.500
-Did you give it to your boyfriend?
-There's no boyfriend.

35:02.583 --> 35:05.625
Come on. I saw you.
You brought him to our house.

35:06.375 --> 35:08.208
I know you've been
seeing him for months now.

35:08.291 --> 35:10.416
-Jack.
-You disappear. Did you steal for him?

35:10.500 --> 35:13.791
There's nothing going on
between me and Dylan James. Nothing.

35:14.291 --> 35:16.916
Leni, you know that's not true.

35:18.125 --> 35:20.375
You've been lying to everyone.

35:22.583 --> 35:25.000
-It's not… Jack.
-No, no, no.

35:25.833 --> 35:27.708
This is not how a family should be.

35:27.791 --> 35:29.083
No, please.

35:29.166 --> 35:33.375
Leni. I'm sorry.
It's time we both came clean.

35:33.458 --> 35:34.333
Meggie.

35:34.916 --> 35:36.958
I won't let her threaten me anymore.

35:39.375 --> 35:41.125
I'm in love with this woman.

35:41.958 --> 35:42.791
Oh.

35:42.875 --> 35:45.750
I was afraid,
but I'm not afraid anymore.

35:46.250 --> 35:48.875
Not of Leni or of anyone. I love you.

36:08.250 --> 36:10.583
Truth is, he made his own bed here.

36:10.666 --> 36:13.291
What the fuck is going on, G?

36:14.000 --> 36:16.875
-What are you doing?
-I want the money and the passports.

36:17.875 --> 36:20.625
Is this Dylan?
Has Dylan convinced you of something?

36:20.708 --> 36:22.708
No, this has nothing to do with Dylan.

36:23.500 --> 36:26.250
This truly has
everything to do with Dylan.

36:26.333 --> 36:30.083
No, this is me leaving. That was clear.

36:31.375 --> 36:34.416
No. No, no, no. Nothing's clear.

36:35.083 --> 36:37.166
You would never leave Mattie.

36:37.250 --> 36:41.333
Or Jack or Charlie or… or me.

36:41.416 --> 36:44.625
Yeah. You knew this day was coming.

36:44.708 --> 36:48.666
No, Gina. This is me begging you.

36:49.208 --> 36:52.125
Hey. Do not destroy this family.

36:53.875 --> 36:55.125
Let's get you help.

36:55.208 --> 36:59.250
I want you to talk to Charlie
and tell him that you are struggling.

36:59.333 --> 37:01.791
You want me talk to Charlie?
Tell him everything?

37:01.875 --> 37:03.750
No, no, no. You know what I mean.

37:04.416 --> 37:06.166
Honey, you're having a break.

37:06.875 --> 37:10.458
Yeah. With my fucked up life.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.041
What is that?

37:16.791 --> 37:19.541
The great thing about an electronic diary

37:19.625 --> 37:23.791
is you can back it up
with a single keystroke.

37:24.375 --> 37:27.041
Then you can slip it in the pocket
of someone like Charlie

37:27.125 --> 37:28.166
or Victor or Sheriff Floss

37:28.250 --> 37:31.708
and in an instant
everyone knows everything.

37:32.250 --> 37:36.125
About us, about Claudia, the fire.

37:36.916 --> 37:37.875
You can't.

37:38.833 --> 37:40.916
And even if you wanted to destroy me,

37:42.500 --> 37:43.416
you wouldn't.

37:44.875 --> 37:47.291
'Cause you would ruin too many lives, G.

37:48.291 --> 37:50.458
You would break so many hearts.

37:51.166 --> 37:52.083
Think of Mattie.

37:52.833 --> 37:53.666
I am.

37:55.458 --> 37:56.333
And Dad?

37:58.500 --> 38:00.041
He has six months to live.

38:03.958 --> 38:06.208
Don't you want to spend it with him?

38:09.375 --> 38:11.833
As me? Or as you?

38:13.500 --> 38:14.375
Cake!

38:15.750 --> 38:17.583
Hey, you two. It's time for cake.

38:18.708 --> 38:19.708
Time for cake.

38:20.625 --> 38:23.208
You're killing me. Gina.

38:25.208 --> 38:26.750
I'm saving me.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.875
Better go blow out the candles,
don't you think?

38:34.375 --> 38:35.375
For the family.

38:42.791 --> 38:43.666
Leni.

38:44.416 --> 38:45.625
Quick word.

38:47.416 --> 38:48.958
How can I help you, sheriff?

38:49.041 --> 38:51.166
Your mystery ranchers seem to have gone.

38:51.666 --> 38:52.500
Mmm.

38:52.583 --> 38:53.833
Yes, they have.

38:53.916 --> 38:58.416
Seems like you and Gina
were having words about the whole thing.

38:59.000 --> 39:03.416
Oh, that was, uh, a different thing.
Yeah. Family stuff.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.375
Oh, family stuff.

39:06.166 --> 39:09.541
That is the most complicated stuff,
isn't it?

39:09.625 --> 39:12.458
Well, speaking of. Excuse me.

39:13.041 --> 39:13.875
Mmm-hmm.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.458
Leni just told to me.

39:26.541 --> 39:29.750
Cake, everyone. It's time for cake.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.083
-Will you find Mattie, please?
-Okay.

39:34.166 --> 39:35.083
Yeah.

39:40.291 --> 39:42.166
Leni can walk me to the table.

39:45.083 --> 39:46.208
Come here, Dad.

39:50.208 --> 39:52.458
The marriage is
more important than the farm.

39:53.833 --> 39:55.541
It's more important than anything.

39:57.833 --> 40:00.958
Dishonesty will destroy your life, Leni.
Trust me. I know.

40:02.208 --> 40:03.166
Fix it.

40:04.166 --> 40:05.791
Get rid of the James boy.

40:07.333 --> 40:08.375
Or I will.

40:44.083 --> 40:45.375
Happy birthday, love.

40:45.916 --> 40:49.416
Give us the money
or I will take everything from you.

40:50.625 --> 40:52.625
Mattie, should we blow out the candles?

40:52.708 --> 40:53.791
Mmm-hmm.

41:06.708 --> 41:08.375
I'm not mad anymore, Leni.

41:09.125 --> 41:11.208
I still don't know
why you did what you did,

41:11.875 --> 41:13.458
but you helped me find my path.

41:19.875 --> 41:20.791
Leni!

41:20.875 --> 41:22.625
Been trying to catch up
with you all night.

41:22.708 --> 41:25.541
-Sorry, I just gotta…
-Just take a minute, as promised.

41:26.458 --> 41:27.541
Hello.

41:27.625 --> 41:28.500
It's him.

41:28.583 --> 41:30.750
Oh, right, of course it is.

41:31.916 --> 41:33.250
-Beau.
-Beau.

41:33.333 --> 41:35.000
So, so nice to meet you.

41:35.083 --> 41:37.333
I gotta go get Gina,
but I'm going to be right back

41:37.416 --> 41:40.000
and I… I want to hear
everything about everything.

41:43.333 --> 41:46.000
Mattie? Mattie!

41:47.708 --> 41:48.958
Mattie!
