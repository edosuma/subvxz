00:03.160 --> 00:05.240
TARA NARRATING: Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:05.280 --> 00:06.280
-Sorry, Bob.

00:06.320 --> 00:07.799
-Dad's pulling me out
of the academy.

00:07.839 --> 00:09.480
-I think I have a boyfriend.

00:09.519 --> 00:11.679
-Principal of the
National Ballet.

00:11.720 --> 00:12.640
-Natasha Willis.

00:12.679 --> 00:13.640
[applause]

00:13.679 --> 00:15.839
-Darling.

00:15.880 --> 00:17.640
I've been looking for
you all morning.

00:17.679 --> 00:18.839
-Hi, Mom.

00:18.879 --> 00:20.480
-They won't let me dance.

00:20.519 --> 00:21.800
There's no way I'll
win a scholarship.

00:21.839 --> 00:23.800
You'll have to promise me
you won't tell anyone.

00:28.760 --> 00:29.480
-Abigail.

00:29.519 --> 00:32.600
-Someone get the doctor.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.560
[music playing]

00:39.679 --> 00:46.159
THE WHITE RHINOS: [singing]

00:46.200 --> 00:55.079
Take a breath, close your eyes,
take a leap of faith and

00:55.119 --> 00:57.079
lead the way tonight.

01:01.159 --> 01:04.840
This is my chance, this
is my chance, my

01:04.879 --> 01:06.799
chance to feel alive.

01:22.359 --> 01:25.439
TARA NARRATING: Lately, all I
see in the mirror is a collage

01:25.480 --> 01:27.799
of different body parts.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.239
I'm not a person.

01:29.280 --> 01:31.719
I'm a hip that needs to be
turned out, an arm which could

01:31.760 --> 01:34.400
be better supported.

01:34.439 --> 01:37.680
And so I've started playing this
game where I try to catch

01:37.719 --> 01:41.560
my reflection by surprise to
see if I recognize the girl

01:41.599 --> 01:42.799
staring back at me.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.200
-Are you sure, Mrs. Armstrong?

01:47.239 --> 01:47.599
I know.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.079
I know.

01:49.120 --> 01:50.719
But you know, it's the end of
semester, and you know, I'm

01:50.760 --> 01:52.799
feeling really worried
about Abigail, and--

01:52.840 --> 01:53.680
OK.

01:53.719 --> 01:54.640
OK.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.480
Thank you.

01:55.519 --> 01:56.640
Bye-bye.

01:56.680 --> 01:58.120
Thanks for nothing.

01:58.159 --> 01:59.480
-She still won't put
you through?

01:59.519 --> 02:01.319
-Nope.

02:01.359 --> 02:03.159
TARA NARRATING: I think family
is probably the best mirror--

02:03.200 --> 02:04.640
-Hey!

02:04.680 --> 02:06.719
TARA NARRATING: --because they
know you better than anyone.

02:06.760 --> 02:11.319
And you could always count
on them to stay the same.

02:11.360 --> 02:12.039
-Hey, darling.

02:12.080 --> 02:13.400
How are you?

02:13.439 --> 02:14.400
-Good.

02:14.439 --> 02:15.400
-Hi.

02:15.439 --> 02:17.400
-Darling.

02:17.439 --> 02:18.800
-Hi, Mom.

02:18.840 --> 02:19.639
-Is Dad coming?

02:19.680 --> 02:21.599
-He got stuck at the surgery.

02:21.639 --> 02:22.680
-Um, [inaudible] is probably
the one who

02:22.719 --> 02:23.800
should be saying that.

02:23.840 --> 02:24.439
-Yes, that's right.

02:24.479 --> 02:27.240
-Is that chocolate?

02:27.280 --> 02:29.560
[sigh]

02:29.599 --> 02:30.599
TARA NARRATING: This is
the longest I've been

02:30.639 --> 02:34.080
away from my parents.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.479
-Dad!

02:35.520 --> 02:36.680
-I wonder what they'll see.

02:39.319 --> 02:41.759
-Aah-ha-ha-ha.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.800
TARA NARRATING: I wonder how
they'll think I've changed.

02:43.840 --> 02:44.800
-You look gorgeous.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.159
-I can't believe you
guys are here.

02:46.199 --> 02:47.439
-Your father has been
beside himself.

02:47.479 --> 02:50.319
-Ah, I might have mentioned
it once or twice.

02:50.360 --> 02:51.479
-Well, you know it's just
classes, right?

02:51.520 --> 02:54.439
It's not actually
a performance.

02:54.479 --> 02:55.639
-Oh, Mom.

02:55.680 --> 02:56.800
Mom.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.120
Dad.

02:58.159 --> 02:59.159
This is Ethan.

02:59.199 --> 02:59.520
-Hi.

02:59.560 --> 03:00.039
-Hello.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.039
Crazy.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.680
You two have the exact
same smile.

03:02.719 --> 03:05.479
-Well, it's delightful
to meet you, Ethan.

03:05.520 --> 03:06.319
-Neil.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.319
I've heard so much about you.

03:07.360 --> 03:08.599
-Mr. Webster.

03:08.639 --> 03:09.759
Funny.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.800
I didn't hear about you
until this morning.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.800
-Well, I don't want to interrupt
the reunion.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.159
See you at lunch?

03:17.360 --> 03:18.759
-What?

03:18.800 --> 03:20.520
-I'm almost 16, Dad.

03:20.560 --> 03:21.639
-And how old's he?

03:21.680 --> 03:23.800
-She's allowed to have
boyfriends, Neil.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.439
-I don't recall giving
her permission.

03:26.479 --> 03:27.240
-Dad.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.319
What happened to your tooth?

03:28.360 --> 03:29.800
-Cracked a belt.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.639
-For weeks, I've been asking
him to get it fixed.

03:31.680 --> 03:32.840
But do you think he'll
listen to me?

03:32.879 --> 03:34.439
-I'm not entering any beauty
pageants, am I?

03:34.479 --> 03:35.800
It can wait until we
finish shearing.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.319
-I love you, but you cannot open
your mouth while you're

03:38.360 --> 03:38.680
here.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.319
-[sigh]

03:39.360 --> 03:40.400
-I'm serious.

03:40.439 --> 03:40.800
People are going to
think we're hicks.

03:44.759 --> 03:45.680
[laughter]

03:45.719 --> 03:47.439
[music playing]

03:53.840 --> 03:55.159
-Trina.

03:55.199 --> 03:56.599
Interesting what happens
when you try.

04:03.199 --> 04:04.759
I'm afraid even without
a partner,

04:04.800 --> 04:06.240
that still looks sloppy.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.439
Yes.

04:12.479 --> 04:15.840
You're actually starting
to work together.

04:15.879 --> 04:17.399
[applause]

04:17.439 --> 04:19.399
-Go Tara, Banana!

04:19.439 --> 04:20.800
-Neil.

04:20.839 --> 04:22.319
-Shh.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.680
-Fan club?

04:24.720 --> 04:27.279
-It was meant to be a fair
trade, decent exam marks for

04:27.319 --> 04:29.720
non-dancing holiday
of my choice.

04:29.759 --> 04:31.279
Now she's got us doing some
weird mother-daughter

04:31.319 --> 04:32.600
interview thing.

04:32.639 --> 04:35.720
I swear, all this good behavior
is giving me a rash.

04:35.759 --> 04:37.160
-Lamington?

04:37.199 --> 04:40.199
-Uh, T, they're bonding.

04:40.240 --> 04:43.160
-It's not necessarily
a bad thing.

04:43.199 --> 04:46.800
-And she insisted all summer
that we put Tara--

04:46.839 --> 04:49.360
I'm talking to Kat's mom about
the movies with her that we

04:49.399 --> 04:50.399
saw, remember?

04:50.439 --> 04:51.360
-Not completely.

04:51.399 --> 04:52.800
-Lamington?

04:52.839 --> 04:55.399
-She would scream if I tried to
put her in anything else,

04:55.439 --> 04:59.199
and demanded that we all
call her Natasha.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.199
[laughter]

05:01.240 --> 05:03.800
-We've an appointment in town
later on, so I'm going to miss

05:03.839 --> 05:04.519
your acting classes.

05:04.560 --> 05:05.800
-Uh-huh.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.519
-I'm glad the city's put out
the weather for you.

05:07.560 --> 05:08.639
-Hmm.

05:08.680 --> 05:09.600
-Your father wanted to
take you and your

05:09.639 --> 05:10.680
friends out to tea.

05:10.720 --> 05:11.639
Do you think that's all right?

05:11.680 --> 05:12.959
-Yeah, it sounds great.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
-You wouldn't know it today,
but it's actually been

05:14.040 --> 05:15.800
horrible lately, just
raining nonstop.

05:15.839 --> 05:17.839
-Interesting to hear rain
described as horrible.

05:17.879 --> 05:18.879
-Oh, Dad.

05:18.920 --> 05:19.800
I don't think he meant
it like that.

05:19.839 --> 05:21.279
-Roll, Evan?

05:21.319 --> 05:24.199
Where do you think the wheat
comes from if it doesn't rain?

05:24.240 --> 05:26.160
-I hadn't really thought
about it, sir.

05:26.199 --> 05:31.079
-You think it just magically
appears in the supermarket?

05:31.120 --> 05:33.519
-Uh, I think we left the
thermos in the car.

05:33.560 --> 05:34.560
-We could order drinks here.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.879
I mean, we're sitting
at their tables.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.199
-I don't think anyone's going
to mind, sweetheart.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.319
-We know all about
your city prices.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.800
-Imagine what he could do
with that extra $6.

05:46.839 --> 05:48.160
-Huh.

05:50.680 --> 05:51.600
-Hey!

05:51.639 --> 05:52.439
What do you think
you're doing?

05:55.519 --> 05:57.720
Talking to you, son.

05:57.759 --> 05:59.480
-You've, uh, got a leak.

05:59.519 --> 06:03.240
-Is that right?

06:03.279 --> 06:06.040
Weren't you just dancing
with my daughter?

06:06.079 --> 06:07.160
-So?

06:07.199 --> 06:08.600
-So I didn't think a
ballet boy would be

06:08.639 --> 06:11.199
interested in cars.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.560
-Didn't think a ballet
girl's father would

06:12.600 --> 06:14.120
own something decent.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.079
[music playing]

06:26.120 --> 06:27.439
-No, your folks are great.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.800
I mean, your dad obviously wants
to disembowel me, but

06:28.839 --> 06:29.639
minor detail.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.600
-You think you have problems?

06:32.639 --> 06:35.639
-If I didn't relish the image
of Natasha in a caravan, I

06:35.680 --> 06:37.199
would tell her to stuff
that holiday--

06:37.240 --> 06:37.800
-Mom--

06:37.839 --> 06:38.480
-Hi, Mom!

06:38.519 --> 06:39.600
It's good to see you.

06:39.639 --> 06:41.319
-Tara, I wanted to invite
you and your

06:41.360 --> 06:42.480
parents for dinner tonight.

06:42.519 --> 06:44.240
Boncafe?

06:44.279 --> 06:45.680
-Oh, thanks but, um--

06:45.720 --> 06:47.800
-I think they wanted
to take us out.

06:47.839 --> 06:49.199
But we can always
combine, right?

06:49.240 --> 06:51.160
-Well, I did, but, but then
something came up, and now

06:51.199 --> 06:51.519
they're busy.

06:51.560 --> 06:52.279
-Shame.

06:52.319 --> 06:53.240
Still, you should come.

06:53.279 --> 06:54.439
Let's go comb through
this hair.

06:54.480 --> 06:57.720
We have a meeting with
the stylist.

06:57.759 --> 07:00.319
-Save me.

07:00.360 --> 07:03.480
-Hey, you didn't have to ditch
your parents on my behalf.

07:03.519 --> 07:04.920
-Trust me.

07:04.959 --> 07:07.240
Dad would complain about the
small portion sizes and Mom

07:07.279 --> 07:08.439
would go on about how
much it costs.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.560
It's just easier if I do
something with them--

07:10.600 --> 07:13.160
-Tomorrow?

07:13.199 --> 07:14.480
You guys don't mind, do you?

07:14.519 --> 07:15.480
That I'm cancelling?

07:15.519 --> 07:16.920
-No, princess.

07:16.959 --> 07:19.600
I had my heart set on the
steakhouse, but if you're all

07:19.639 --> 07:20.480
too tired--

07:20.519 --> 07:21.439
-Tara!

07:21.480 --> 07:23.240
-Yeah, we really, really are.

07:23.279 --> 07:24.040
Thanks, Dad.

07:24.079 --> 07:25.839
[music playing]

07:47.439 --> 07:48.639
-Abigail?

07:51.240 --> 07:54.319
-You look nice, darling.

07:54.360 --> 07:55.600
-We decided to go
out after all.

07:55.639 --> 07:57.279
It was a spur-of-the-moment
decision.

07:57.319 --> 07:57.800
Oh.

07:57.839 --> 08:00.639
I can do that.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.199
-Our meeting today
was at the bank.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.120
We're trying to refinance
one of the loans.

08:05.160 --> 08:09.040
Uh, they're not taking
risks at the moment.

08:09.079 --> 08:09.720
-So, what?

08:09.759 --> 08:12.319
Are we losing the farm?

08:12.360 --> 08:13.600
-Oh, no.

08:13.639 --> 08:16.360
Look if all prices go up,
we should be fine, but

08:16.399 --> 08:17.720
everything's tight.

08:17.759 --> 08:19.199
-I can get a job.

08:19.240 --> 08:20.560
On Sundays, I think, or--

08:20.600 --> 08:21.800
-I don't know if that's going
to cover it, sweetie.

08:24.519 --> 08:27.639
-Then what can I do to help?

08:27.680 --> 08:30.480
-Look, I'd be lying
if I said having

08:30.519 --> 08:31.800
you here wasn't expensive.

08:31.839 --> 08:34.679
And with the boarding fees,
and the shoes, and the

08:34.720 --> 08:36.320
leotards, it all adds up.

08:36.360 --> 08:36.840
-No.

08:36.879 --> 08:37.480
-Let me finish.

08:37.519 --> 08:38.159
-No, Mom.

08:38.200 --> 08:38.759
This is me.

08:38.799 --> 08:39.440
This is my dream.

08:39.480 --> 08:40.558
-I know it is, sweetie.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.639
And I want you to have that.

08:42.679 --> 08:46.679
But I'm just, I'm just trying
to juggle a few

08:46.720 --> 08:48.080
dreams right now.

08:51.519 --> 08:53.679
Look, would it, would it
honestly be the end of the

08:53.720 --> 08:56.200
world if you deferred
until next year?

08:56.240 --> 08:59.240
Just until we can
work things out?

08:59.279 --> 09:01.639
-What does Dad say?

09:01.679 --> 09:04.480
-Your dad doesn't want
you to know.

09:04.519 --> 09:05.480
He's so proud of you.

anything, honey, except

-You look like sisters.

09:25.879 --> 09:27.360

Natasha, when I saw you dance
Aurora I couldn't believe you

09:29.879 --> 09:31.679
had a 15-year old at home.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.679
-So, Kat, did you see your
mom in that role?

09:33.720 --> 09:34.679
-Yeah, yeah, I-I-I-I
always watch her.

-It just amazes me, Natasha,
how you juggle everything.

09:39.720 --> 09:41.720
Lars Peterson told me that
you're booked for

09:41.759 --> 09:43.200

You can't tell me that you
didn't come home after that

09:51.480 --> 09:53.159

09:53.200 --> 09:55.639
-No, but nothing's
confirmed yet.
