01:31.592 --> 01:35.262
<i>Can't count all the ways</i>

01:36.388 --> 01:39.016
<i>I made you feel hurt</i>

01:40.809 --> 01:44.354
<i>I miss you when I</i>

01:45.689 --> 01:48.192
<i>Get lost in the dirt</i>

01:49.818 --> 01:54.156
<i>And don't wake me up</i>

01:54.740 --> 01:57.201
<i>Don't like what you do</i>

02:01.163 --> 02:07.127
<i>I can't fight 'em off</i>

02:09.963 --> 02:14.468
<i>And I can't fight 'em off</i>

02:16.887 --> 02:19.890
<i>For you</i>

02:19.890 --> 02:24.853
<i>Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you</i>

02:25.395 --> 02:28.315
<i>Happy birthday, dear Sam</i>

02:29.066 --> 02:32.694
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

02:39.743 --> 02:41.328
- Yeah. Thanks.
- I'll take it.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.377
Happy birthday, sweetie.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.674
You see that? Her eyes, they fluttered.

02:54.258 --> 02:55.801
Can you check the monitor?

02:55.801 --> 02:58.554
I think there's movement behind
her eyelids. I think she's waking up.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.057
<i>You see? Check the monitors.</i>

03:03.100 --> 03:04.768
<i>You see that?</i>

03:05.519 --> 03:06.603
Dad?

03:06.603 --> 03:08.856
<i>By myself</i>

03:11.900 --> 03:14.278
<i>But the monitors aren't showing anything.</i>

03:14.278 --> 03:16.238
<i>You didn't see it. I saw it.</i>

03:16.238 --> 03:18.073
Just, please. Ask for the doctor.

03:18.073 --> 03:21.243
Joe, you're exhausted.
You need to take a break.

03:21.827 --> 03:24.872
Hon, go home.
We can take care of her tonight.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.290
I saw something.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.266
Police! Search warrant!

03:44.766 --> 03:45.767
Police!

03:48.979 --> 03:50.772
- Go! Go! Go!
- Clear!

03:52.482 --> 03:54.401
Police! Search warrant!

03:58.530 --> 04:00.240
Jesus fucking Christ.

04:00.908 --> 04:01.742
Wow.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.624
This has gotta be Iggy's spot
from Sam's zine.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.667
Nicky Chaos's place.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.726
Looks like a baby bomb.

04:27.726 --> 04:30.229
Smaller than the one
that was on 175th Street.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.025
They've been working up to something.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.537
I don't get it.

04:46.537 --> 04:49.957
What's an uptown D-bag like Amory Gould
have to do with any of this?

04:49.957 --> 04:52.876
- Captain still won't sign his warrant?
- Not without more evidence.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.378
At least a strong motive.

04:54.378 --> 04:56.338
If we bring him in for questioning...

04:56.338 --> 04:58.674
He'll lawyer up. Or worse, disappear.

04:58.674 --> 04:59.758
Yeah.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.810
You in the market for a pet?

05:09.810 --> 05:13.397
These assholes are never coming back.
Can't leave these little guys here.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.327
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

05:39.381 --> 05:42.092
He was right.
They were making something big.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.553
Too bad it's gone, and so are they.

05:45.721 --> 05:47.890
- So what do we do now?
- All we can do.

05:48.599 --> 05:49.600
We wait.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.395
Like sitting fucking ducks.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.939
<i>I fucking told you Charlie would narc.</i>

05:56.648 --> 05:59.568
Charlie was a disappointment.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.821
- But also utterly predictable.
- This is all because of you.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.324
Another dumb bitch
taking in a stray puppy.

06:05.324 --> 06:07.159
Hey, hey, hey!

06:08.660 --> 06:11.205
I love your tender heart.

06:12.581 --> 06:14.166
But we're doing this for Sam.

06:15.209 --> 06:19.588
Ultio nostra means "vengeance is ours."

06:19.588 --> 06:23.592
When we finish this tomorrow,
then we get the hell out of town.

06:23.592 --> 06:27.471
When we return,
we're coming back to a new city.

06:28.972 --> 06:32.851
You know, one where people will take
our ideas just a little more seriously.

06:33.894 --> 06:37.064
Or at least there'll be a lot
fewer rich folks who wanna live here.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.525
It's not all evil executives
who work in that building.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.612
There's normal people too,
like janitors and shit.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.573
That's exactly why you're staying
in the van.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.994
Your fucking feelings
get the best of you every single time.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.746
Sol, calm down.

06:53.372 --> 06:54.581
Everybody's on edge.

06:55.249 --> 06:56.959
We're gonna feel a lot better after.

06:58.585 --> 06:59.586
Okay?

07:00.295 --> 07:02.381
Yo. Let's go, Sol.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.357
I mean, the poor man made it himself.

07:20.357 --> 07:25.404
The least we can do is eat it. All right.
Here's your piece.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.364
You're not gonna have a little piece?

07:27.364 --> 07:29.324
Looks good, but I gotta watch my sugar.

07:29.908 --> 07:32.244
One piece. Tiny, tiny piece.

07:32.244 --> 07:33.662
I'll have the same size.

07:59.730 --> 08:00.981
I'm sorry, Sam.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.110
I'm so sorry.

08:06.695 --> 08:09.907
I'm sorry that I was late that night,

08:10.532 --> 08:11.658
and that I ran away.

08:11.658 --> 08:12.743
And...

08:13.785 --> 08:16.079
And that I didn't even know
it was your birthday.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.377
To be honest, I don't even know
what day it is anymore.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.591
But I do know about the fires.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.469
And about that guy who died.

08:33.222 --> 08:36.725
And I think it must've been really hard
for you to keep going after that.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.523
<i>I think you would've
done something about it.</i>

08:44.191 --> 08:45.359
Charles?

08:47.486 --> 08:50.197
<i>You wanted to help,
but they didn't want you to go, right?</i>

08:52.407 --> 08:54.159
Charles, where are you?

08:57.621 --> 08:59.414
But who were you gonna tell that night?

09:01.792 --> 09:03.460
And who tried to stop you?

09:04.378 --> 09:07.714
For a minute, I thought it must've been
Nicky, but I saw the photo.

09:08.632 --> 09:10.801
I don't think he would hurt you.

09:13.679 --> 09:16.056
All I know is that you are good.

09:16.056 --> 09:21.144
You would stand up for what's right
and somehow that put you here.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.105
So, I'm gonna do the same.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.735
They made a bomb for revenge.

09:28.735 --> 09:33.323
Against who I don't know,
but I called it in.

09:33.323 --> 09:36.076
I'm gonna go to the cops,
and I'm turning myself in next.

09:36.076 --> 09:39.037
And I'm gonna tell 'em everything I know.

09:45.377 --> 09:46.795
I'm here to say goodbye...

09:48.422 --> 09:50.883
'cause I don't know when I'll be able
to see you again.

09:52.426 --> 09:55.762
Or if I'll be able to see you again.

09:56.638 --> 10:01.727
But maybe I could just stay here
for a little while longer.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.731
Not gonna lie, I'm really tired and...

10:08.942 --> 10:10.194
I've really missed you.

10:19.203 --> 10:20.954
I've really, really missed you.

10:34.176 --> 10:35.177
William?

10:37.638 --> 10:38.639
William?

10:41.975 --> 10:42.976
William!

10:46.730 --> 10:47.940
Thank goodness.

10:47.940 --> 10:51.235
- Babe...
- I just thought...

10:51.235 --> 10:55.113
Thought I just ran out
first chance I could get?

10:55.113 --> 10:56.323
Get a fix?

10:58.116 --> 10:59.117
I'm sorry.

11:00.035 --> 11:06.041
Yeah, well, if I OD,
then Amory Gould gets off scot-free.

11:08.210 --> 11:10.504
And we're not gonna let that happen,
are we?

11:10.504 --> 11:11.588
No.

11:16.593 --> 11:19.638
God, I've missed that kiss.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.526
But before we get going
to see Detective Parsa,

11:32.526 --> 11:36.655
I really think you should speak
to your sister alone.

11:37.239 --> 11:38.949
You two have found each other again.

11:38.949 --> 11:41.535
Let some good come out of the bad
that's been happening.

11:47.958 --> 11:50.669
- Hi.
- Good morning, everyone.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.257
You're Mom's brother, right?

11:56.550 --> 11:57.551
The one who ran away?

11:57.551 --> 11:59.761
It's a little more complicated than that.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.431
- Are you still sick?
- I didn't know that I was.

12:02.431 --> 12:04.141
It's a different kind of sick, Cate.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.768
- Like an addict.
- What's an addict?

12:13.108 --> 12:14.109
It...

12:18.655 --> 12:19.948
Hey, I'm your Uncle William.

12:20.616 --> 12:23.076
It is damn nice to finally meet you.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.870
You said the D word.

12:24.870 --> 12:26.622
I know most of the bad words.

12:26.622 --> 12:28.498
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

12:28.498 --> 12:32.044
Little more family bonding with
Uncle William here, you'll know them all.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.005
So, you're Will, huh?

12:35.797 --> 12:37.382
It's a pretty sick name, right?

12:38.258 --> 12:39.176
And you're Cate?

12:40.135 --> 12:43.222
You know you look exactly
like your mom did when she was your age?

12:44.473 --> 12:45.682
Hey, where is your mom anyway?

12:46.391 --> 12:47.392
Not up yet.

12:47.392 --> 12:50.354
- Do you think I should go wake her up?
- Yeah, she'll love that.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.524
Nice to meet y'all.

12:54.691 --> 12:57.528
That is some sorry-looking
cereal right there.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.863
How 'bout I whip up something
for you kids?

12:59.863 --> 13:01.114
Yeah?

13:04.159 --> 13:05.160
Hi.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.625
Okay. Do you think that this is
the first time ever in history

13:11.625 --> 13:13.126
that I'm awake before you?

13:13.126 --> 13:14.586
Wait, what time is it?

13:14.586 --> 13:15.838
Where are the kids?

13:15.838 --> 13:18.590
They're awake and being fed by Mercer,

13:18.590 --> 13:22.094
which undoubtedly means a veritable feast.

13:22.928 --> 13:24.513
You met the kids and I wasn't there.

13:25.138 --> 13:30.519
I know, like what? Cate, are you kidding?
She's ridiculo-- I mean, she's you.

13:31.770 --> 13:37.359
Will is appropriately skeptical.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.778
Protective. I respect it.

13:40.696 --> 13:43.448
Honestly,
I spent all of 90 seconds with them,

13:44.283 --> 13:47.452
and I can tell you're a really great mom.

13:48.579 --> 13:52.791
I'm a borderline disaster
who's barely hanging on most of the time.

13:52.791 --> 13:55.794
You still can't take
a fucking compliment, huh?

14:02.176 --> 14:05.012
I'm just glad you didn't give up
motherhood altogether.

14:07.931 --> 14:10.058
What does that mean?

14:11.226 --> 14:12.477
What do you mean?

14:18.358 --> 14:19.359
I know.

14:22.613 --> 14:25.866
The first thing I'm gonna say
is I'm sorry.

14:29.703 --> 14:33.874
I only know what--
whatever Amory had in his file.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.836
Do you know that he has a file
for every single one of us?

14:38.670 --> 14:40.255
I wanna hear the story.

14:40.255 --> 14:42.549
I wanna hear your story
if you wanna tell me.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.011
What do you wanna know, William?

14:46.637 --> 14:47.638
Everything.

14:48.847 --> 14:51.934
You wanna know how I waited too long?

14:51.934 --> 14:55.729
How I didn't think it could be possible?

14:56.313 --> 14:59.566
How my jeans kept getting tighter
even though I stopped eating?

14:59.566 --> 15:03.862
How I was psychotic with denial?

15:04.530 --> 15:06.823
- What else?
- I went to a clinic

15:06.823 --> 15:08.659
and I was past 24 weeks.

15:08.659 --> 15:11.078
So there was nothing to be done.

15:12.162 --> 15:17.584
I gave up my semester abroad in Italy
and I drove to Buffalo to a nunnery.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.169
Me with fucking nuns.

15:19.169 --> 15:22.339
And that is where I had a baby.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.803
That must've been really fucking lonely.

15:31.849 --> 15:33.517
Amory knows all of this?

15:34.560 --> 15:36.603
Amory knows everything.

15:40.482 --> 15:45.195
All of the information about the couple
that adopted him

15:45.195 --> 15:47.990
- was just sitting right there.
- Don't say "him!"

15:47.990 --> 15:52.286
I didn't ask if it was a boy or a girl.
I didn't ask you anything!

15:52.286 --> 15:55.122
I get it, right? I understand
that you think this would be a lot easier

15:55.122 --> 15:57.499
if you didn't know anything,
but I also know you.

15:57.499 --> 16:01.837
And I am sure that this fucking haunts you
every goddamn day of your life.

16:01.837 --> 16:05.048
And here it is.
It's all right here, Reegs.

16:05.674 --> 16:08.218
Who knows who this kid is now?

16:08.218 --> 16:09.720
What he's grown up to be.

16:09.720 --> 16:12.347
- How he could possibly fit into your life?
- Stop.

16:12.347 --> 16:15.767
Aren't you at all a little curious?
This is your son.

16:15.767 --> 16:17.728
That is not my son.

16:17.728 --> 16:18.896
He's one of us.

16:18.896 --> 16:20.397
For better or for worse, right?

16:20.397 --> 16:23.400
This is why
I didn't wanna tell you, William.

16:25.569 --> 16:26.570
Okay, look.

16:28.155 --> 16:29.573
I hear you. I'm sorry.

16:29.573 --> 16:31.450
It's there, okay?

16:31.450 --> 16:33.619
If you wanna throw it out, it's on you.

16:33.619 --> 16:36.622
And if not, I'm here.

16:44.838 --> 16:45.839
I love you.

17:08.069 --> 17:10.656
How is my girl this morning?

17:12.699 --> 17:16.411
I hope you had good dreams
last night, baby.

17:19.915 --> 17:22.501
<i>The forecast,
mostly sunny skies today with...</i>

17:22.501 --> 17:24.962
<i>Tomorrow, more sunny skies
and slightly warmer temperatures.</i>

17:24.962 --> 17:26.128
<i>While the recent decline</i>

17:26.128 --> 17:28.799
<i>in the city's murder rate
was cheered as good news,</i>

17:28.799 --> 17:33.887
<i>many are critical of a police department
that continues to let open cases go cold.</i>

17:33.887 --> 17:36.306
<i>The latest example
is a Fourth of July shooting</i>

17:36.306 --> 17:38.934
<i>of an unidentified female victim
in Central Park.</i>

17:39.810 --> 17:42.229
<i>Six weeks later,
there is no one in custody.</i>

17:42.729 --> 17:44.398
<i>And the victim remains in a coma,</i>

17:44.398 --> 17:48.110
<i>sparking speculation that she
will soon be taken off life support</i>

17:48.110 --> 17:51.071
<i>and the shooting will
become yet another unsolved murder.</i>

17:53.323 --> 17:54.324
And he won't sign it?

17:54.825 --> 17:56.410
That is correct, Mr. Gould.

17:56.410 --> 18:00.622
- And he understands what they're offering?
- It appears that way.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.041
Put me on.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.754
It's Mr. Gould. He would like a word.

18:08.338 --> 18:09.631
It's not necessary, Amory.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.633
Hi, Bill. Hey, Felicia.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.677
<i>And good morning, crack legal team.</i>

18:13.677 --> 18:16.847
- I understand there's a problem?
- Not a problem, per se.

18:16.847 --> 18:18.348
We're just...

18:19.391 --> 18:21.643
- We're weighing our options.
- Look, Bill.

18:21.643 --> 18:24.646
The feds have put a hell of a deal
on the table.

18:24.646 --> 18:27.733
<i>One we've all worked very hard
for on your behalf.</i>

18:27.733 --> 18:33.363
It makes it all go away with
no real penalty to you or the company.

18:33.363 --> 18:35.240
Which is wonderful.

18:35.240 --> 18:38.327
And we are so grateful for your efforts.

18:38.911 --> 18:42.080
And all I need to do is sign an affidavit
admitting to wrongdoing.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.332
<i>That's right.</i>

18:43.332 --> 18:46.210
One little piece of paper
and it all goes away.

18:46.210 --> 18:48.712
I already stepped down
from the company I built.

18:48.712 --> 18:51.507
Which really helped. No doubt about that.

18:51.507 --> 18:56.094
At the end of the day,
what does a man have if not his name?

18:57.971 --> 18:59.181
He's got freedom, Bill.

19:00.265 --> 19:01.517
He's got options,

19:01.517 --> 19:06.355
like what Hawaiian island you wanna
visit on your well-earned retirement.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.405
I need to make a phone call.

19:16.073 --> 19:17.282
To whom? Regan?

19:17.282 --> 19:19.409
Her plate is quite full right now.

19:19.409 --> 19:20.494
No, to William.

19:21.161 --> 19:22.955
I wanna find out how his swim meet went.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.457
<i>He's a very strong swimmer, you know.</i>

19:26.208 --> 19:27.751
I'm very proud of him.

19:27.751 --> 19:28.836
Of course, dear.

19:28.836 --> 19:30.546
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

19:34.258 --> 19:37.010
Let him call Andover again.
They can deal with him.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.679
This goddamn disease is so unpredictable.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.228
So what kind of music
do you guys listen to?

19:46.228 --> 19:48.230
Britney Spears! Mom's favorite.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.773
Can I tell you a secret?

19:49.773 --> 19:54.111
Your mom has always
had the worst taste in music.

19:54.111 --> 19:55.737
- Like, the worst.
- Wha--

19:55.737 --> 19:57.447
What are you talking about?

19:57.447 --> 20:00.909
I always like, like, British ska,

20:00.909 --> 20:03.579
- and Kate Bush and the Talking Heads.
- Oh, my. Ska.

20:03.579 --> 20:04.913
Oh, please.

20:04.913 --> 20:10.294
First of all, I liked Talking Heads,
you loved "Mr. Roboto."

20:10.294 --> 20:11.503
- No-- What?
- Unironically.

20:11.503 --> 20:13.088
- You lie.
- Really?

20:13.088 --> 20:14.173
Wow.

20:14.173 --> 20:15.507
Okay, please tell your children

20:15.507 --> 20:18.385
that you did not know every single word
to that song growing up?

20:18.385 --> 20:21.263
Your mom, she used to dance like this
for real.

20:23.015 --> 20:24.349
You do dance like that, Mommy.

20:24.349 --> 20:25.934
No.

20:25.934 --> 20:28.103
Do not trust him, Cate.

20:28.770 --> 20:33.025
Your uncle's number one character flaw
is that he always thinks he's right.

20:34.735 --> 20:38.030
Okay. It was a problem when I was younger,

20:38.030 --> 20:42.075
but I mean, I am so much more mature.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.744
I'm older, I'm wiser.

20:43.744 --> 20:45.454
You should probably listen
to everything I say.

20:46.872 --> 20:49.917
- What? Stop.
- All right. We're here at camp.

20:53.837 --> 20:56.381
- This is camp? Wow.
- It's incredible. Yeah.

20:56.381 --> 20:59.176
- You want me to just take 'em in?
- Yeah. You wanna?

20:59.176 --> 21:01.053
Yes. All right, kiddo.

21:01.053 --> 21:02.846
Okay, are you ready?

21:02.846 --> 21:04.223
It's camp time!

21:07.017 --> 21:08.519
Will? Will.

21:08.519 --> 21:10.771
- Your backpack.
- Got it?

21:12.523 --> 21:13.524
Come on.

21:14.566 --> 21:16.068
All right, let's do it.

21:20.739 --> 21:23.784
Oh, my God. That is a sight to see.

21:24.952 --> 21:27.120
Look at him with the pink backpack.

21:28.789 --> 21:29.790
Hello?

21:29.790 --> 21:31.542
Regan, Bill is missing.

21:31.542 --> 21:32.835
What do you mean missing?

21:32.835 --> 21:36.213
Mathes left his post, leaving Bill
unattended and now he's wandered off.

21:36.213 --> 21:37.673
You said to let him make a call.

21:37.673 --> 21:39.883
He's never tried anything
like this before.

21:39.883 --> 21:42.177
<i>Well, Mathes, now he's tried it.
Are you happy?</i>

21:42.177 --> 21:44.054
And you have no idea where he went?

21:44.054 --> 21:47.182
He said he was going to call Andover
to see how William's swim meet went.

21:47.182 --> 21:49.685
Okay, the police shouldn't
be the ones to find--

21:49.685 --> 21:51.895
I'll be right over. Bye.

21:51.895 --> 21:53.063
That didn't sound good.

21:53.063 --> 21:54.606
Daddy's missing.

21:55.232 --> 21:58.735
Last thing he said was something about one
of your high school swim meets.

21:58.735 --> 22:00.362
Jesus Christ.

22:00.362 --> 22:02.114
You're never far from his mind.

22:02.114 --> 22:04.116
- It's that bad, huh?
- Sometimes.

22:04.116 --> 22:05.367
If this is one of them,

22:05.367 --> 22:07.661
then he's wandering around lost
and confused, and he--

22:07.661 --> 22:09.746
He is on foot, okay?
So he couldn't have gotten far.

22:09.746 --> 22:12.291
Let's just go to the apartment.
My meeting can wait.

22:12.291 --> 22:13.375
Okay.

22:13.959 --> 22:15.419
- Yeah. All right.
- Yeah.

22:21.550 --> 22:23.635
I don't really wanna say goodbye,
so I'll just--

22:26.555 --> 22:27.639
I'll see you later.

23:03.926 --> 23:05.344
Oh, Sam.

23:12.309 --> 23:13.310
I'm sorry.

23:16.563 --> 23:17.564
You trusted me.

23:20.734 --> 23:22.110
I have no idea why.

23:22.986 --> 23:25.572
You trusted me and I didn't trust you.

23:27.115 --> 23:29.243
- Hey! Get away from her!
- What the fuck?

23:30.410 --> 23:31.912
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

23:33.038 --> 23:35.082
- Are you the kid they're looking for?
- What?

23:35.082 --> 23:37.501
Are you? What are you doing here?

23:37.501 --> 23:39.211
- Did you shoot her?
- What?

23:39.211 --> 23:40.170
- No!
- Did you?

23:40.170 --> 23:43.090
- I would never. Did you?
- No.

23:43.090 --> 23:44.591
Well, aren't you Nicky's boss?

23:44.591 --> 23:46.593
- Who's Nicky?
- He thinks his boss shot Sam.

23:46.593 --> 23:47.678
Wait.

23:49.096 --> 23:50.138
Do you mean...

23:51.348 --> 23:54.101
- Do you mean Amory Gould?
- Well, I don't know what his name is.

23:54.101 --> 23:56.854
Nicky just calls that--
him the devil or demon or--

23:56.854 --> 23:57.855
The demon brother.

23:58.522 --> 23:59.940
That's what Nicky called the bomb.

23:59.940 --> 24:01.108
Sorry, bomb?

24:01.108 --> 24:02.901
Has it been in the news
that a bomb went off?

24:02.901 --> 24:04.278
No.

24:04.778 --> 24:07.531
Okay, good. Good. I called it in.
The police probably found it.

24:07.531 --> 24:08.740
Okay, that's good.

24:10.951 --> 24:11.952
Unless they didn't.

24:14.371 --> 24:16.039
- I gotta go.
- No, you're not going anywhere.

24:16.039 --> 24:17.124
You're a wanted man.

24:17.124 --> 24:19.209
- Get out of my way. Hey!
- No, wait a second.

24:19.209 --> 24:20.669
- No! Hey!
- Hey! Let me go!

24:20.669 --> 24:22.921
- Nurse! Security!
- The bomb is out there!

24:22.921 --> 24:25.883
- I think I know where they're putting it!
- Security!

24:27.342 --> 24:29.845
Lord Jesus! Security!

24:30.596 --> 24:31.889
Security!

24:31.889 --> 24:33.015
- Let go of me.
- I got him!

24:33.557 --> 24:35.309
- Hey
- Get off of me.

25:12.221 --> 25:14.848
The only thing that sucks
is that we won't be there to see it.

25:14.848 --> 25:18.644
Yeah. The great artists
were always unappreciated in their time.

25:19.478 --> 25:20.604
- I like that.
- Yeah?

25:26.527 --> 25:29.238
- Where she at?
- She's probably taking a piss.

25:29.238 --> 25:31.281
She always has to take a piss.

25:34.159 --> 25:35.244
SG?

25:35.744 --> 25:38.121
- Fuck it, man. Come on. We gotta go.
- We're not leaving without her.

25:38.121 --> 25:41.166
Yo. I think maybe she left without us.

25:41.166 --> 25:43.836
- What are you saying?
- Look, man. You heard her last night.

25:43.836 --> 25:45.838
She wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.

25:46.463 --> 25:48.590
If she said goodbye,
would you really let her leave?

25:55.430 --> 25:57.099
We're returning to a brand-new city.

25:59.184 --> 26:00.894
I'm sorry that she's not gonna be here.

26:03.105 --> 26:06.191
People are who they are. Okay?

26:14.199 --> 26:15.325
Oh, my God. It's him!

26:16.285 --> 26:18.537
Dad, where are you?

26:25.669 --> 26:26.920
There he is.

26:32.259 --> 26:33.510
I got this.

26:38.765 --> 26:39.808
Okay.

26:48.775 --> 26:51.528
- Hey, Dad.
- Am I dreaming?

26:53.488 --> 26:56.992
No. You're not dreaming.

26:57.868 --> 26:59.828
- It's you.
- It's me.

27:00.871 --> 27:04.374
My son.

27:13.425 --> 27:15.677
Please, could you find a Detective Parsa?

27:15.677 --> 27:18.764
- He knows me.
- Well, I bet he knows me too.

27:18.764 --> 27:20.474
Or wants to. I'm a person of interest, so...

27:20.474 --> 27:23.018
- Yeah, I found him.
- No. Actually, I was gonna turn myself in,

27:23.018 --> 27:24.561
- and then I found you.
- Hi. Hello.

27:24.561 --> 27:25.979
What the hell is this?

27:25.979 --> 27:28.065
Altercation between these two
in Mount Sinai.

27:28.065 --> 27:30.484
You, I am not surprised. But who i--

27:32.277 --> 27:34.071
Holy shit.

27:34.071 --> 27:36.782
I didn't recognize you without the mop.
You're Charlie frickin' Weisbarger.

27:36.782 --> 27:38.951
He was creeping around Sam's room
at the ho--

27:38.951 --> 27:42.037
Wha-- I-- No. I wasn't creeping.
What the hell were you doing in her room?

27:42.037 --> 27:43.914
Separate these two.
I don't want them talking.

27:44.998 --> 27:46.917
- Where's Parsa?
- Not here.

27:54.591 --> 27:55.717
Detective Parsa.

27:55.717 --> 27:56.802
William.

27:57.886 --> 28:00.347
- It's good to see you. Alive.
- Yeah, you too.

28:00.931 --> 28:03.559
I look much better here than I would
at the bottom of the bay, right?

28:03.559 --> 28:04.935
Don't we all?

28:05.561 --> 28:07.604
You said you have information
relevant to the case?

28:07.604 --> 28:11.859
Yes. And I brought my entire family.

28:20.284 --> 28:22.119
Okay, I have been here.

28:22.619 --> 28:23.662
Seen it with my own eyes.

28:23.662 --> 28:27.624
Blocks and blocks of closed-up,
burnt-down buildings in the Bronx.

28:27.624 --> 28:32.421
So, I am sure if you look at any of this,
they're all arson.

28:34.006 --> 28:37.676
Samantha had a photo in one of her zines
of one of the fires.

28:37.676 --> 28:39.052
That means she was there.

28:39.052 --> 28:41.263
Why was Samantha burning buildings
in the Bronx?

28:42.181 --> 28:45.684
That's because of Nicholas McKay.

28:46.685 --> 28:49.521
Also known as Nicky Chaos.

28:49.521 --> 28:51.523
And why was he burning buildings
in the Bronx?

28:51.523 --> 28:54.193
Because he needs money
to support his operation.

28:54.193 --> 28:56.862
So he has a band, which he stole,

28:56.862 --> 29:02.326
his shitty squat, pseudo-intellectual
social movement, right?

29:02.326 --> 29:05.746
Plus, there's the fact that
he's a pyromaniac.

29:06.496 --> 29:08.457
Yeah, I mean, he loves it.

29:08.457 --> 29:11.710
If money's the motive, who's paying him?

29:12.628 --> 29:16.507
Dad, I'm gonna say something--

29:16.507 --> 29:19.343
The person paying this young man
to burn these buildings

29:20.802 --> 29:23.305
is my brother-in-law, Amory Gould.

29:24.431 --> 29:26.558
- Dad?
- How did you know that?

29:26.558 --> 29:28.810
I'm not quite sure what I know. Not yet.

29:28.810 --> 29:31.813
But I've been suspicious for a while.
Please, continue.

29:36.568 --> 29:37.986
- Hello?
- Mrs. Weisbarger?

29:37.986 --> 29:41.365
- Yes?
- Detective McFadden, NYPD.

29:41.365 --> 29:43.325
We got your son Charlie here
at the station.

29:43.325 --> 29:47.913
- You do? Is he--
- Alive? Yes.

29:48.872 --> 29:50.499
<i>In trouble, also yes.</i>

29:50.499 --> 29:52.543
But he's safe. And you can see him.

29:54.002 --> 29:55.212
I am on my way.

29:57.256 --> 29:59.383
I got a lot on my plate,
so give me the short version.

29:59.383 --> 30:00.551
I went to see Samantha.

30:00.551 --> 30:02.553
That kid was there.
I recognized him from the poster.

30:02.553 --> 30:04.096
We got into it when he tried to leave.

30:04.096 --> 30:06.515
But, wait, he said something about a bomb.

30:06.515 --> 30:08.684
He said he called it in,
asked if you guys found it.

30:08.684 --> 30:10.561
Yeah. He did, and we didn't.

30:10.561 --> 30:15.649
This I can't explain. He said
it was named after my wife's step-uncle.

30:15.649 --> 30:17.860
- Amory Gould?
- Yeah.

30:19.695 --> 30:21.280
<i>The other day I followed Nicky,</i>

30:21.280 --> 30:25.659
and I saw him meet Amory
at the Harlem River right on the bridge.

30:25.659 --> 30:28.287
I needed proof
that they were working together, right?

30:29.663 --> 30:30.873
I found it.

30:30.873 --> 30:31.915
"LH"?

30:32.541 --> 30:35.377
The only reason
Amory ever investigated Nicky

30:35.377 --> 30:37.963
was because he was my friend. Right?

30:39.590 --> 30:42.509
But Nicky's file,
it wasn't with the personal stuff.

30:43.093 --> 30:45.179
Nicky's file was with the business files.

30:45.179 --> 30:47.806
Right, because it is business.

30:47.806 --> 30:52.311
LH is Liberty Heights,
is a proposed development right here.

30:52.311 --> 30:55.105
But the only way
to get investors interested

30:55.105 --> 31:00.611
in an under-resourced area like that
is to operate on a massive scale.

31:00.611 --> 31:03.030
Like, basically, build a small town.

31:03.947 --> 31:07.743
But when we ran the numbers
on acquiring this land,

31:07.743 --> 31:10.454
it was astronomical.
So the project got shelved.

31:11.038 --> 31:15.042
Until Amory just decided
to discount all the prices himself.

31:15.042 --> 31:18.253
Hire Nicky to burn down
an entire fucking neighborhood.

31:18.253 --> 31:20.547
What does that mean
from a business perspective?

31:20.547 --> 31:23.425
Once enough properties
had been boarded up and abandoned,

31:23.425 --> 31:26.094
then Amory could apply to the city
for a blight decree.

31:26.094 --> 31:30.390
It means the city can expropriate the land
and then sell it back at a very low price.

31:30.390 --> 31:33.185
And if he's got more fires planned,
that means more people could get hurt.

31:33.185 --> 31:34.686
Or worse.

31:34.686 --> 31:37.523
Look, we need to be able to prove
he made this blight decree.

31:40.567 --> 31:43.320
Is this proof enough?

31:47.032 --> 31:47.991
What is that?

31:47.991 --> 31:50.494
This morning
I had breakfast with the deputy mayor.

31:51.245 --> 31:53.580
He didn't see any problem
with sharing a document

31:53.580 --> 31:55.582
written on my own company's letterhead.

31:56.250 --> 31:57.876
It's an application for a blight decree.

31:57.876 --> 32:00.170
- Signed by Amory Gould.
- That's it.

32:00.170 --> 32:05.008
- That was impressive, Dad.
- And they said that you'd lost it.

32:05.008 --> 32:08.720
These days more often than I'd like,
they're right. But I do have my moments.

32:10.055 --> 32:15.477
I didn't wander off. I escaped.
People believe what they wanna believe.

32:15.477 --> 32:17.980
Sometimes
a man's weakness is his strength.

32:18.856 --> 32:22.401
Both true, and both came in handy today.

32:25.529 --> 32:27.364
I was in the building, and I heard--

32:29.992 --> 32:31.618
William. Hi.

32:32.160 --> 32:33.871
It's been a minute, huh?

32:33.871 --> 32:35.205
Keith, William's back.

32:35.205 --> 32:38.834
And apparently, we're solving
the attempted murder of a young girl.

32:38.834 --> 32:41.545
I assume that's why you're here.

32:41.545 --> 32:46.550
Unless you're embroiled
in other crimes that I don't know about.

32:46.550 --> 32:49.636
Wait a minute.
How does Keith know this girl?

32:49.636 --> 32:51.180
They were having an affair.

32:51.180 --> 32:52.306
Jesus, Reggie.

32:53.182 --> 32:57.102
Hey, Bill. Yes, it's true.

32:58.270 --> 33:01.398
We're splitting up.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner, Daddy.

33:02.983 --> 33:05.194
But I guess that's him, right?

33:05.194 --> 33:09.656
That's you. Back of your head. Preppy.

33:14.161 --> 33:15.245
Holy shit.

33:19.291 --> 33:20.292
It's you.

33:22.002 --> 33:23.253
You're Amory's bagman.

33:25.589 --> 33:30.385
Wow, Keith. So, I take it
that's where you met Sam.

33:31.345 --> 33:32.346
Right.

33:33.305 --> 33:34.306
Bagman?

33:35.015 --> 33:37.809
- What are you talking about?
- Where do I start?

33:37.809 --> 33:39.937
The beginning is usually a good place.

33:40.979 --> 33:45.400
Yeah. Amory had me drop off
an envelope downtown every month.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.986
To that address.

33:47.986 --> 33:50.364
- At Nicky's place?
- I don't know whose place it was

33:50.364 --> 33:52.449
or what was in the envelope.

33:52.449 --> 33:55.452
Wasn't told, didn't ask.
But I assume it was money.

33:55.452 --> 33:56.870
Why would you do that?

33:56.870 --> 33:59.289
Because I owed Amory,
and I didn't want you to know.

33:59.289 --> 34:00.415
Know what?

34:00.415 --> 34:02.793
That I didn't drop out of med school,
I flunked out.

34:02.793 --> 34:07.714
That Amory got me my first finance job.
And when I lost all of our money,

34:07.714 --> 34:09.842
all my clients' money,
Amory bailed me out.

34:09.842 --> 34:12.803
All he wanted in return
was one errand once a month.

34:12.803 --> 34:15.429
You saved my life.
I'm not gonna forget it.

34:15.429 --> 34:20.101
You needed a friend. You found one in me.
And you know, I was happy to do it.

34:21.395 --> 34:22.728
- Thank you.
- One more thing.

34:31.572 --> 34:33.949
I didn't go to business school
to be a drug dealer.

34:33.949 --> 34:35.909
And who said anything about drugs?

34:35.909 --> 34:39.746
Take the gun. Deliver the package.
That's all I'm asking.

34:41.748 --> 34:43.500
Surely, that's not too much?

34:45.502 --> 34:47.337
Why-- Why wouldn't you tell me that?

34:47.337 --> 34:51.675
You could-- You could've told me that.
Any-- All of it.

34:52.551 --> 34:53.594
Maybe.

34:55.512 --> 34:56.763
Maybe not.

35:03.979 --> 35:05.189
What happened on the fourth?

35:05.189 --> 35:07.858
Sam called me. Wanted to talk.

35:10.360 --> 35:13.071
Said if I didn't come to her,
she'd come to me, to the party.

35:14.072 --> 35:16.241
I saw her there by the park.

35:17.701 --> 35:20.078
She was at the bus stop.
I don't think she saw me.

35:21.955 --> 35:23.290
I freaked out and took off.

35:24.499 --> 35:27.127
I thought she'd sent Regan a note
outing the affair.

35:27.127 --> 35:30.547
I thought she wanted to talk about us.
But now I know something was wrong.

35:30.547 --> 35:35.969
She was scared. And maybe in her world,
I constituted a responsible adult,

35:36.887 --> 35:38.222
someone she could trust.

35:40.724 --> 35:43.644
Black powder was stolen
from Joe Yeung's workshop.

35:44.645 --> 35:46.897
It's dangerous stuff,
and there's a lot missing.

35:46.897 --> 35:49.691
We think
Nicholas McKay has been building a bomb.

35:49.691 --> 35:51.527
Yeah. The kid said the same thing.

35:51.527 --> 35:55.531
- What kid?
- The kid. You know, Weisbarger.

35:57.074 --> 35:58.367
He was brought in with me.

35:59.117 --> 36:01.328
You. What do you know about a bomb?

36:01.328 --> 36:03.372
- I've seen it.
- He drew it.

36:03.372 --> 36:05.207
And I think I know
where they're putting it.

36:05.207 --> 36:08.043
Get an arrest warrant for Amory Gould,
attempted murder.

36:08.043 --> 36:10.379
William Hamilton-Sweeney's here.
He'll give you what you need.

36:10.379 --> 36:11.505
He's alive?

36:12.256 --> 36:14.174
I'm gonna fucking hug that guy.

36:14.174 --> 36:16.885
You're gonna come with me.
Tell me everything you know on the way,

36:16.885 --> 36:18.262
starting with where we're going.

36:19.096 --> 36:20.681
- Okay. All right.
- Come on.

36:23.767 --> 36:27.563
Sir, we just received a bomb threat.
NYPD's sending a team. It seems credible.

36:29.439 --> 36:30.440
I'm sure it is.

36:35.445 --> 36:37.906
Give me five minutes
before you sound the alarm.

36:37.906 --> 36:40.534
- Sir?
- I don't do well with crowds.

37:11.148 --> 37:13.650
Everyone make your way calmly
to the stairwell,

37:13.650 --> 37:14.860
to the front of the building.

37:15.360 --> 37:17.404
We are evacuating the building
as a precaution.

37:24.077 --> 37:25.287
Stay calm.

37:35.797 --> 37:37.883
Keep moving, people, across the plaza.
Thank you.

37:37.883 --> 37:40.219
For your own safety,
move across the street.

37:43.805 --> 37:45.807
<i>Gould has left the building.</i>

37:45.807 --> 37:47.851
<i>They're sweeping the building
floor by floor,</i>

37:47.851 --> 37:50.020
<i>starting at the penthouse
where his office is.</i>

37:51.522 --> 37:52.397
Stay in the car.

37:53.023 --> 37:55.609
What? No, no. Let me help, okay?

37:55.609 --> 37:57.903
Sam might die 'cause
she tried to do something like this.

37:57.903 --> 37:59.821
I'm willing to do the same for her.

37:59.821 --> 38:00.948
That's messed up.

38:01.657 --> 38:04.451
Also, you're a kid,
and I'm not sure I trust you.

38:05.202 --> 38:07.371
Stay in the car, or I'll arrest you.

38:08.664 --> 38:10.499
I'm already arrested, right?

38:10.499 --> 38:12.209
I'm not sure what you are yet.

38:32.646 --> 38:33.814
Keep moving across the street.

38:33.814 --> 38:36.149
- No one's allowed inside.
- Hey! Let go of me.

38:36.149 --> 38:38.485
- Wait, what were you doing in there?
- Buying a fucking condo.

38:38.485 --> 38:39.444
Yeah, right.

38:39.444 --> 38:42.865
Fuck you. I was dropping off
a sandwich for my dad. There he is.

38:42.865 --> 38:44.074
Dad, hey!

38:44.074 --> 38:46.159
Security! Security! We--

39:09.349 --> 39:10.350
Go back in--

39:14.271 --> 39:15.105
Fuck.

39:19.401 --> 39:20.235
Hey, wait!

39:22.154 --> 39:23.113
Oh, shit.

39:31.038 --> 39:32.289
Okay.

39:33.290 --> 39:37.503
Bill's missing, and now
there's a bomb threat? What's going on?

39:37.503 --> 39:41.089
- I don't know.
- How is that possible? You always know.

39:43.550 --> 39:45.636
Bill? Darling.

39:46.220 --> 39:48.180
Regan, you found him. How wonderful.

39:48.764 --> 39:51.099
- Actually, he found us.
- William.

39:52.643 --> 39:55.187
- William, what brings you back?
- Him.

39:55.854 --> 39:58.649
Hi. I'm alive.

39:59.358 --> 40:01.443
I guess
you underestimated my will to live.

40:03.070 --> 40:05.864
Also,
you forgot I'm an incredible swimmer.

40:06.907 --> 40:09.076
I have no idea
what the hell you're talking about.

40:10.744 --> 40:12.120
See, we found your files.

40:13.497 --> 40:14.498
We know everything.

40:15.123 --> 40:19.461
Nicky, the arsons, the blight decree,
Liberty Heights.

40:21.004 --> 40:22.214
You're going to prison.

40:22.798 --> 40:27.970
How dare you burst in here and start
hurling these outlandish accusations.

40:27.970 --> 40:31.223
He didn't burst in. He came in with me,
invited into my home.

40:32.349 --> 40:33.350
His home.

40:34.601 --> 40:38.522
William has made a very compelling case
regarding your crimes, Amory.

40:39.648 --> 40:41.859
If only I'd listened to him more closely
years ago,

40:41.859 --> 40:44.319
we might not have
lost so much time as a family.

40:45.612 --> 40:49.283
And that poor young girl might not be
fighting for her life right now.

40:49.283 --> 40:51.243
- What girl?
- The girl that was shot in the park.

40:51.243 --> 40:54.329
William has some wild theory
about my involvement.

40:54.329 --> 40:57.332
- It's over.
- Bill, what are you saying?

40:57.332 --> 41:00.460
Isn't it clear? William's always
wanted Bill to cast me out.

41:00.460 --> 41:03.213
It's taken 15 years,
but he's finally succeeded,

41:03.213 --> 41:04.923
at least from the family.

41:05.716 --> 41:07.384
We'll see what happens with the business.

41:07.384 --> 41:10.137
Amory, I'm sure if we dug deep enough,

41:10.137 --> 41:12.931
we'd find that you were responsible
for those crimes too.

41:15.184 --> 41:17.102
Look at this formidable team.

41:17.102 --> 41:22.482
The dried-up divorcée,
the addled patriarch and the junkie son.

41:22.482 --> 41:26.111
Not to mention,
the Great American Novelist.

41:26.111 --> 41:28.697
You know, your barbs no longer injure me,
Mr. Gould.

41:29.281 --> 41:32.117
A villain's words tend to lose their power
once his plot's been revealed.

41:32.701 --> 41:34.328
That's Mercer's way of saying,
"Fuck you, Amory."

41:34.328 --> 41:36.914
You know what, fuck him.
And fuck all of you!

41:37.497 --> 41:41.335
I've been eating your shit for decades,
and now...

41:44.254 --> 41:46.215
you're gonna have to deal without me.

41:49.968 --> 41:52.095
- No, no.
- William!

42:18.664 --> 42:19.873
SG!

42:35.138 --> 42:36.181
SG!

42:37.975 --> 42:39.810
Lorraine, where are you?

42:45.691 --> 42:46.608
Lorraine!

42:46.608 --> 42:49.945
- William. William. Don't hurt him.
- Come on, William. Stop, please.

42:49.945 --> 42:51.780
I could give a shit about Amory,
but, like--

42:51.780 --> 42:53.866
But we also
don't want you to get in trouble.

42:53.866 --> 42:55.909
- Please, William. It's gonna be okay.
- Right.

42:55.909 --> 42:58.662
We can't let him leave.
He'll slip off on to some private jet,

42:58.662 --> 43:01.456
disappear to whatever the fuck island
his creepy friend owns.

43:01.456 --> 43:03.542
- This is unbelievable.
- No, okay!

43:03.542 --> 43:05.460
See, everybody else has paid
for what you've done.

43:05.460 --> 43:06.753
Everyone except for you.

43:08.213 --> 43:09.214
Do you need help, sir?

43:09.882 --> 43:11.592
No, Mathes. Just leave us.

43:13.343 --> 43:14.469
Mr. Gould.

43:15.387 --> 43:17.097
- Get away from him.
- What are you doing?

43:17.097 --> 43:18.640
Oh, my--

43:18.640 --> 43:20.017
It's okay, it's okay.

43:21.059 --> 43:23.687
Regan, call an ambulance.
Please call the ambulance right now!

43:23.687 --> 43:25.230
It's okay. Just hold on.

43:25.856 --> 43:27.024
Come on.

43:27.816 --> 43:29.318
Look at me. Relax.

43:29.318 --> 43:32.404
Hi, we need an ambulance.
Someone's been stabbed.

43:32.404 --> 43:33.488
It's okay.

43:36.074 --> 43:37.075
Charlie.

43:38.243 --> 43:41.163
- Hey. Hey.
- You're too late, Charlie.

43:41.163 --> 43:44.166
No. That's not true.
Until it goes off, we still have time.

43:44.166 --> 43:47.586
Okay? There's gotta be something.
You're here. You gotta help me.

43:47.586 --> 43:50.047
- I'm here to die.
- What? Why?

43:50.047 --> 43:52.174
I tried to stop it, but I can't.

43:54.593 --> 43:56.303
I don't know who I am anymore.

43:57.054 --> 43:59.056
Maybe I was never that great
to begin with.

44:00.474 --> 44:01.892
I must've had some good in me.

44:05.270 --> 44:07.022
I've done so many things, Charlie.

44:10.108 --> 44:12.611
Bad things. And for what?

44:13.195 --> 44:18.075
- To help people? Who have we helped?
- Hey. Hey, it's okay. All right?

44:18.075 --> 44:20.994
We all fell for it.
Nicky's just good at what he does.

44:20.994 --> 44:23.997
Now you know the truth. Like me
and Sam, which means you're already free.

44:23.997 --> 44:25.707
Sam is not free, Charlie.

44:27.209 --> 44:30.379
- Who knows if Sam is even gonna live?
- You can do what Sam couldn't.

44:30.379 --> 44:32.464
You can stop this.
Well, you and me together.

44:32.464 --> 44:34.550
I know the bomb is in here,
and I think you know where.

44:34.550 --> 44:36.677
If you tell me,
we can finish what Sam started.

44:36.677 --> 44:39.805
She didn't want any more people
getting hurt, and I know you don't either.

44:40.305 --> 44:43.141
Lorraine, I can't save them, but you can.

44:57.281 --> 44:59.366
- I told you there's no time.
- Where is it?

44:59.366 --> 45:02.578
- Charlie, stop. What are you doing?
- Where is it? Lorraine, where is it?

45:04.705 --> 45:05.706
It's down there.

45:11.086 --> 45:13.505
Nicky and the guys
got jobs as window washers.

45:19.261 --> 45:20.596
Charlie, stop.

45:21.180 --> 45:22.848
Stop. What are you doing? Charlie!

45:24.016 --> 45:25.934
Charlie, stop! Stop! What are you doing?

45:31.190 --> 45:32.983
Charlie, no! It's too far!

45:44.244 --> 45:47.831
Charlie, stop! Please!
You're gonna fall. Don't make me see that.

45:52.920 --> 45:55.547
Charlie, please! There's no time!
Just listen to me!

45:57.216 --> 46:00.219
<i>Hey, Charlie. Something's happened.</i>

46:13.065 --> 46:13.941
Charlie!

46:15.150 --> 46:16.568
No! No!

46:28.413 --> 46:30.082
Someone tell me what the fuck is going on.

46:42.261 --> 46:44.096
Well, how much longer is it gonna take?

46:44.596 --> 46:46.139
Why aren't the generators kicking in?

46:46.139 --> 46:47.891
Maintenance is working
as fast as they can.

46:48.517 --> 46:50.519
What? Stop!

47:03.323 --> 47:06.702
Hang in there, baby girl.
I am not letting you go out like this.

47:21.341 --> 47:26.180
Please! Please, let me out!
