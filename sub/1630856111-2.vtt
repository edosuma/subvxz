Huh, I'm sorry, but I could
hardly have had the back wax.

09:50.451 --> 09:54.835
So, if we can't figure out
how, we need to figure out who.

09:56.285 --> 09:58.252
Talk to the bridesmaids.

09:58.287 --> 10:00.461
Okay, but if they're
all pals, then...

10:00.496 --> 10:03.913
Oh, Fergus, you
have a lot to learn.

10:03.948 --> 10:06.467
Six women in a friend group?

10:06.502 --> 10:11.093
Think of, er, Henry the VIII's
wives having a reunion party.

10:11.127 --> 10:12.370
What?

10:12.404 --> 10:14.268
[playful music]

10:15.994 --> 10:18.894
[Ruth]Elaine is insisting
she goes ahead with the wedding.

10:18.928 --> 10:20.378
I've stepped in
as Matron of Honour.

10:20.412 --> 10:23.692
I would have done it originally,
but I was just so busy.

10:23.726 --> 10:25.038
Looking for a job.

10:25.072 --> 10:26.211
[coughs]

10:26.246 --> 10:27.730
Well, you can't have
been very close to Nuala

10:27.765 --> 10:30.388
if you're happy to just move on.

10:30.422 --> 10:31.907
Nuala was a nasty little bitch.

10:31.941 --> 10:33.874
[laughs]

10:33.909 --> 10:36.670
I don't even know why
Elaine hung around with her.

10:36.705 --> 10:38.810
I mean, she was old.

10:38.845 --> 10:42.262
- Wasn't she 34?
- Yeah.

10:42.296 --> 10:44.264
And, like, bitter with it.

10:44.298 --> 10:46.438
I reckon she's the
one who got you fired, Ruth.

10:46.473 --> 10:48.337
I wasn't fired, I was let go!

10:48.371 --> 10:50.684
Well, isn't that the same thing?

10:50.719 --> 10:52.099
Drinking on the job, wasn't it?

10:52.134 --> 10:53.066
[laughs]

10:53.100 --> 10:55.102
You are such a bitch, Denise!

10:55.137 --> 10:57.760
Wait, how could Nuala
have something to do with that?

10:57.795 --> 11:00.314
She didn't, it was just
a big misunderstanding.

11:00.349 --> 11:01.902
Oh, Ruth, no, it wasn't!

11:01.937 --> 11:04.387
You were boasting about
going on this trip to Fiji.

11:04.422 --> 11:06.320
And Nuala made a comment
about how you could afford it

11:06.355 --> 11:09.116
on a secretary's wage,
she was seething, like...

11:09.151 --> 11:12.188
Nuala didn't like anybody having
something she couldn't have.

11:12.223 --> 11:15.467
[Denise]She totally told your
boss you were pissed, Ruth.

11:15.502 --> 11:17.159
Will you just shut up, Denise?

11:17.193 --> 11:19.471
You're making it sound
like I had a problem with Nuala.

11:19.506 --> 11:20.818
I didn't!

11:20.852 --> 11:22.302
And she thought I was a slut.

11:22.336 --> 11:23.855
[music continues]

11:23.890 --> 11:25.961
Never said it, but I'd say
something like, you know

11:25.995 --> 11:29.171
"Oh, I've met a guy,"
and she'd give me the look.

11:29.205 --> 11:30.897
Did that bother you?

11:30.931 --> 11:33.244
Enough to wanna
give her a smack.

11:33.278 --> 11:35.902
Not enough to kill her,
if that's what you're asking.

11:35.936 --> 11:38.836
What about you, Eniola?

11:38.870 --> 11:41.217
- We were fine.
- Yeah, right.

11:41.252 --> 11:44.324
She was always throwing digs
at you, I mean, asking you to

11:44.358 --> 11:47.258
pick Elaine something
to wear for her wedding night.

11:47.292 --> 11:48.431
What a cow!

11:48.466 --> 11:51.918
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing.

11:51.952 --> 11:54.368
I work for a clothing brand.

11:54.403 --> 11:55.956
Eniola!

11:57.302 --> 11:58.752
I used to date Richie.

11:58.787 --> 12:01.479
Okay! Christ!

12:01.513 --> 12:04.344
Why would you accept
to be a bridesmaid?

12:04.378 --> 12:06.104
Ah, to make a point.

12:06.139 --> 12:07.278
[pensive music]

12:07.312 --> 12:10.384
You're, er, not bothered.

12:10.419 --> 12:11.765
I-I'm not.

12:12.801 --> 12:14.975
It was a long time ago.

12:15.010 --> 12:17.426
It was right before
he got with Elaine.

12:17.460 --> 12:20.532
[suspenseful music]

12:25.503 --> 12:27.194
I've a degree in pharmacy, yeah.

12:27.229 --> 12:29.472
Obviously, I know
what botulinum can do.

12:31.060 --> 12:34.339
But I was in my treatment
room, the whole time.

12:34.374 --> 12:37.549
The police have confirmed
all that with the CCTV footage.

12:37.584 --> 12:40.104
- Haven't they, Molly?
- Yeah, oof!

12:40.138 --> 12:42.520
And you met Nuala
in college, didn't you?

12:42.554 --> 12:44.936
Yeah, she did marketing.

12:44.971 --> 12:46.489
And what about you, Molly?

12:46.524 --> 12:48.629
Er, my degree is computers.

12:48.664 --> 12:50.908
Elaine, I think
I've broken something.

12:50.942 --> 12:52.461
Nuala was a mature student.

12:52.495 --> 12:54.359
She was gas, wasn't she, Mols?

12:54.394 --> 12:55.844
[chuckles]

12:55.878 --> 12:58.605
Oh, you are in pain, aren't you?

12:58.639 --> 12:59.917
It'll be worth it, though.

12:59.951 --> 13:02.851
Just a few more pounds
and your dress will fit.

13:02.885 --> 13:05.612
See, I'm not one of
those brides that's worried

13:05.646 --> 13:08.442
my bridesmaids will look
better than me on the day.

13:08.477 --> 13:10.065
I want them looking their best.

13:10.099 --> 13:11.273
[sighs]

13:11.307 --> 13:15.070
If I'm gorgeous in my pics
and my maids are all minging...

13:15.104 --> 13:17.348
I won't be able to post
any group shots on Insta.

13:17.382 --> 13:18.867
[scoffs]

13:18.901 --> 13:21.524
Take five, Mols,
I'll get some water.

13:21.559 --> 13:24.113
- Anyone else?
- Yeah, please.

13:24.148 --> 13:25.459
[sighs]

13:25.494 --> 13:28.290
[heavy breathing]

13:28.324 --> 13:31.051
My dress would fit
if she'd got it in my size.

13:31.086 --> 13:32.881
[chuckles]

13:32.915 --> 13:34.330
Rescue me, please.

13:34.365 --> 13:35.504
[sighs]

13:36.919 --> 13:40.267
I think she's crazy,
going ahead with this.

13:40.302 --> 13:41.475
Did you tell her that?

13:43.029 --> 13:44.858
[sighs]

13:44.893 --> 13:46.964
I don't wanna upset her.

13:46.998 --> 13:50.243
She's a tiny straw
away from a full breakdown.

13:50.277 --> 13:52.279
There's been
so much aggro already.

13:52.314 --> 13:54.005
Aggro about what?

13:54.040 --> 13:57.906
Well, the Matron of Honour
stuff, for a start.

13:57.940 --> 14:01.633
Ruth is Elaine's family
and I'm her oldest friend.

14:01.668 --> 14:05.292
But Nuala was willing to
organize and pay for everything.

14:05.327 --> 14:06.915
You didn't like Nuala.

14:06.949 --> 14:08.640
I didn't like confrontation.

14:08.675 --> 14:10.332
I'm not good at it.

14:10.366 --> 14:14.646
I'd no real issue with Nuala,
I just want people to get along.

14:14.681 --> 14:16.925
But didn't you want
to be the Matron of Honour, too?

14:16.959 --> 14:19.617
I mean, considering that you're
the bride's oldest friend?

14:19.651 --> 14:22.551
Ah, I don't want to
sit at the top table.

14:22.585 --> 14:24.173
Wh-why not?

14:24.208 --> 14:26.417
Uh, my parents
will be sitting at it.

14:26.451 --> 14:28.626
They're Elaine's godparents.

14:28.660 --> 14:31.008
Why wouldn't you
want to sit with your parents?

14:33.251 --> 14:37.393
I'm gay and they're soldiers
of Christ, you know how it goes.

14:37.428 --> 14:39.188
Raging homosexuality being

14:39.223 --> 14:42.605
contagious and
sinful and all that.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.504
That can't be easy.

14:44.538 --> 14:46.264
[Molly]
It's easier than you think.

14:46.299 --> 14:48.508
They haven't talked to me
since I came out.

14:48.542 --> 14:49.612
It doesn't bother me.

14:49.647 --> 14:51.545
[soft sombre music]

14:53.168 --> 14:54.134
[glass clink]

14:58.656 --> 15:00.520
[instrumental music]

15:01.797 --> 15:03.626
[Elaine]
That's what I mean!

15:03.661 --> 15:06.975
Nobody is going to
drink anything at my wedding!

15:07.009 --> 15:09.978
[cries]

15:15.293 --> 15:18.538
Okay, I have no idea which one
of them could have killed her.

15:18.572 --> 15:20.954
I mean, it could have
been any of them!

15:20.989 --> 15:23.405
Indeed, we're no closer
to knowing who...

15:23.439 --> 15:24.958
and we still don't know how.

15:24.993 --> 15:27.547
We need to find out
what the police know.

15:27.581 --> 15:29.204
Leave that with me.

15:29.238 --> 15:32.448
Okay, so, erm, I...

15:32.483 --> 15:35.313
I-I have plans with my mam.

15:35.348 --> 15:37.005
I'll see you later.

15:39.041 --> 15:41.561
[instrumental music]

15:43.356 --> 15:45.254
[keys jangle]

15:45.289 --> 15:47.394
[Fergus]Come on, smelly belly!
Get your coat!

15:47.429 --> 15:49.258
[Liberty]
I'm not smelly!

15:49.293 --> 15:51.398
[water splattering]

15:51.433 --> 15:54.539
She's doing a good thing,
buying us this house.

15:54.574 --> 15:56.783
Saint Paula, our hero.

15:56.817 --> 15:59.337
[water splattering]

15:59.372 --> 16:00.580
Da!

16:03.548 --> 16:05.826
[sighs]

16:05.861 --> 16:08.139
I just hope
it doesn't end in tears.

16:08.174 --> 16:10.003
It won't!

16:10.038 --> 16:11.591
[water splattering]

16:15.422 --> 16:17.148
[exhales]

16:17.183 --> 16:18.287
Come on, stinker!

16:18.322 --> 16:19.668
[water splattering]

16:21.152 --> 16:22.567
[clattering]

16:22.602 --> 16:24.121
[sombre music]

16:24.155 --> 16:25.777
Don't know if you guys
know this about me

16:25.812 --> 16:27.469
but I'm actually an
Olympic level bowler.

16:27.503 --> 16:28.642
- So, er...
- Mm, yeah.

16:28.677 --> 16:30.196
- Shall we get in?
- That's, that's likely.

16:30.230 --> 16:32.129
[bowling pins clatter]

16:32.163 --> 16:33.578
[groans]

16:35.615 --> 16:37.065
- Mm.
- Okay!

16:37.099 --> 16:38.169
[Lola laughs]

16:39.584 --> 16:40.827
You're so bad!

16:40.861 --> 16:42.725
- Okay! Alright!
- You're absolutely bad!

16:42.760 --> 16:44.279
- Yeah, you tell him.
- Hey!

16:44.313 --> 16:45.418
[bowling pins clatter]

16:45.452 --> 16:47.420
Hey! I'm Lola.

16:47.454 --> 16:49.491
- Pleased to meet you.
- And you.

16:49.525 --> 16:51.320
Wow! Fergus said
you were gorgeous.

16:51.355 --> 16:52.563
[gasps]

16:52.597 --> 16:54.289
You said I was gorgeous?

16:54.323 --> 16:55.497
Well, you are gorgeous.

16:55.531 --> 16:57.188
Shut up.

16:57.223 --> 16:58.327
Hi!

16:58.362 --> 17:00.605
Right, come here,
little smelly belly.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.469
[inhales softly]

17:02.504 --> 17:03.815
[music continues]

17:03.850 --> 17:06.025
We spoke about this, remember?
This is our mam.

17:07.785 --> 17:11.478
- Sorry, she's not usually...
- That's okay.

17:11.513 --> 17:13.825
You were so little
the last time I saw you.

17:13.860 --> 17:15.448
Do you still have Mr. Janky?

17:15.482 --> 17:19.314
I'm too big for a blanket,
they're for babies.

17:19.348 --> 17:21.626
So what do you do
when you get scared?

17:21.661 --> 17:23.283
I don't get scared.

17:23.318 --> 17:24.905
No? I do.

17:24.940 --> 17:27.218
Like right now, I haven't
bowled in so long.

17:27.253 --> 17:29.531
And I'm so scared
I'm gonna be as bad as Fergus.

17:29.565 --> 17:30.877
[laughs]

17:32.534 --> 17:33.500
[inhales softly]

17:33.535 --> 17:34.743
I could teach you, if you like?

17:34.777 --> 17:36.572
Oh, I would really like that!

17:36.607 --> 17:39.299
Can we?
Okay, let's go, perfect.

17:39.334 --> 17:40.680
[bowling pins clatter]

17:40.714 --> 17:43.234
- Thanks.
- Got a pink ball...

17:43.269 --> 17:45.271
[clattering]

17:45.305 --> 17:47.790
[sirens wail]

17:47.825 --> 17:50.345
[dramatic music]

17:51.691 --> 17:54.797
[indistinct chatter]

18:09.502 --> 18:12.125
[paper rustling]

18:14.507 --> 18:15.680
[camera clicks]

18:16.888 --> 18:18.683
It's not even the turkey
that I like, anyways.

18:18.718 --> 18:20.892
- I know.
- Harry!

18:22.411 --> 18:24.310
You shouldn't be in here.

18:24.344 --> 18:26.208
I was just about to ask Charlie

18:26.243 --> 18:28.521
if I could speak
to the two of you.

18:28.555 --> 18:30.661
About?

18:30.695 --> 18:32.456
Oh, for the love of God!

18:32.490 --> 18:36.149
The bride is fixated
on her big day going to plan.

18:36.184 --> 18:38.703
Oh, yeah, total bridezilla.
We know.

18:38.738 --> 18:42.466
She wanted assurances that
we'd solve this before Saturday.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.916
Look, I'm sure she jumped
the gun coming to us.

18:44.951 --> 18:46.401
I mean, it's
only been a few days

18:46.435 --> 18:49.162
and I'm sure you,
you already have it in hand.

18:49.197 --> 18:51.337
You should leave it
to us anyway.

18:51.371 --> 18:52.821
- Well, Vicky, we--
- What?

18:52.855 --> 18:54.650
But Charlie is breathing
down our necks on this--

18:54.685 --> 18:56.997
And you wanna go
running to his mum!

18:57.032 --> 18:58.689
So, you're stuck?

18:58.723 --> 19:00.415
[soft instrumental music]

19:00.449 --> 19:02.279
The post mortem showed
that she ingested botulinum.

19:02.313 --> 19:03.659
Jordan!

19:03.694 --> 19:05.316
It had to have been
in the second champagne glass.

19:05.351 --> 19:07.870
But forensics is backed up, so
we don't actually know that yet.

19:07.905 --> 19:09.493
- But how the hell else did--
- Jordan!

19:09.527 --> 19:10.701
She could help, Vicky.

19:10.735 --> 19:12.806
- You need to leave.
- Fine.

19:12.841 --> 19:14.256
But we could help each other.

19:14.291 --> 19:15.844
[laughs]

19:15.878 --> 19:17.570
We all know how this will go.

19:17.604 --> 19:20.193
[deep breath]

19:20.228 --> 19:21.574
You have my number.

19:25.440 --> 19:28.270
What did Malky say about this?

19:28.305 --> 19:31.791
He's not happy,
but he trusts me.

19:31.825 --> 19:33.724
You're the grown-up.

19:33.758 --> 19:35.933
Nah, it's not like that.

19:35.967 --> 19:36.899
[chuckles]

19:38.729 --> 19:40.834
Oh, I've missed so much.

19:40.869 --> 19:42.698
I know it's my fault.

19:42.733 --> 19:44.597
Ah, look, let's not
worry about blame.

19:44.631 --> 19:46.806
[indistinct chatter]

19:46.840 --> 19:47.945
[phone rings]

19:47.979 --> 19:49.257
[Fergus] Sorry.

19:52.052 --> 19:53.813
- Yeah?
- Fergus.

19:53.847 --> 19:56.781
I've seen the crime scene photos
and I think I'm onto something.

19:56.816 --> 19:59.232
[Harry on phone]
Can you meet me at Carol's?

19:59.267 --> 20:00.544
[sighs]

20:00.578 --> 20:01.890
Sure, um...

20:03.719 --> 20:05.549
Can you, can you give me,
like, an hour?

20:05.583 --> 20:07.585
- I'll see you there.
- Okay.

20:09.725 --> 20:11.589
Sorry, we, er,
we've got a case.

20:11.624 --> 20:12.590
[chuckles]

20:12.625 --> 20:14.937
My son, the working man!

20:14.972 --> 20:16.387
[chuckles]

20:16.422 --> 20:18.458
There's a
photo booth over there.

20:18.493 --> 20:20.011
Can I take a photo with Liberty?

20:20.046 --> 20:22.600
Just... as a memento?

20:22.635 --> 20:23.601
I don't see why not.

20:23.636 --> 20:25.396
[sombre music]

20:25.431 --> 20:27.881
- Whoo!
- Yeah, nice one!

20:27.916 --> 20:30.298
[laughs]

20:30.332 --> 20:31.954
Look at you!

20:31.989 --> 20:33.266
[camera clicks]

20:34.957 --> 20:37.028
[growling]

20:37.063 --> 20:38.029
[laughs]

20:38.064 --> 20:39.859
- Nice!
- Not bad that, right?

20:39.893 --> 20:41.964
[Lola]
Yeah, no, it's impressive.

20:41.999 --> 20:42.862
[laughter]

20:42.896 --> 20:44.484
[indistinct chatter]

20:44.519 --> 20:45.623
[Lola laughs]

20:45.658 --> 20:47.418
Can I get one of you
by yourself?

20:47.453 --> 20:49.558
So I have your beautiful face.

20:49.593 --> 20:50.697
- I don't mind.
- Okay.

20:50.732 --> 20:53.355
[laughter]

20:53.390 --> 20:55.806
No silly faces,
just you looking beautiful!

20:55.840 --> 20:58.498
[music continues]

20:58.533 --> 20:59.775
[camera clicks]

21:04.884 --> 21:07.714
Carol, Carol,
can I show you something?

21:08.715 --> 21:09.958
It's a crime scene photo.

21:11.994 --> 21:14.997
- What am I looking at?
- That's Nuala's glass.

21:15.032 --> 21:16.344
It has two raspberries in it.

21:16.378 --> 21:18.863
The, the other glasses
only had one.

21:18.898 --> 21:21.556
I know, I put them in myself.

21:21.590 --> 21:24.075
Then why does Nuala's have two?

21:24.110 --> 21:25.732
It couldn't.

21:25.767 --> 21:27.113
It makes no sense.

21:27.147 --> 21:28.977
Are you saying that
you didn't put it in there?

21:29.011 --> 21:30.323
I didn't.

21:30.358 --> 21:32.843
Could you have
put it in by accident?

21:32.877 --> 21:33.947
No.

21:35.155 --> 21:36.985
Why does that matter?

21:37.019 --> 21:39.608
The second raspberry
contained the poison.

21:39.643 --> 21:41.092
[suspenseful music]

21:41.127 --> 21:43.888
Now, if you know something
or you're just not telling us...

21:45.718 --> 21:47.892
We can help you,
you just need to talk to us.

21:50.378 --> 21:51.551
I...

21:53.070 --> 21:54.416
I have to go.

21:54.451 --> 21:55.590
The police said me and Melanie

21:55.624 --> 21:57.074
can get our things
from the salon.

22:01.423 --> 22:03.114
I didn't do this.

22:03.149 --> 22:04.081
I swear.

22:06.394 --> 22:07.912
You believe her?

22:07.947 --> 22:10.639
I haven't believed
a beautician since my own

22:10.674 --> 22:13.987
told me that permanent polish
wouldn't damage my nails.

22:14.022 --> 22:16.542
God! It's like you're
speaking in tongues.

22:16.576 --> 22:18.406
[pensive music]

22:18.440 --> 22:21.201
Come on, follow me.

22:21.236 --> 22:23.480
We're not gonna do
anything dodgy here, are we?

22:23.514 --> 22:25.551
Define dodgy.

22:28.692 --> 22:31.626
That is shockingly
non-security conscious.

22:31.660 --> 22:32.868
We should check to make sure

22:32.903 --> 22:34.767
she hasn't left
any other doors open.

22:34.801 --> 22:36.389
Just in case.

22:38.426 --> 22:41.394
[suspenseful music]

22:45.087 --> 22:46.365
There.

22:50.576 --> 22:54.994
If I can get into this,
what exactly am I looking for?

22:55.028 --> 22:58.825
A signed confession that
she killed Nuala would be handy.

22:58.860 --> 23:02.208
I don't know,
anything that stands out.

23:02.242 --> 23:03.934
Easy peasy.

23:03.968 --> 23:04.866
[sighs]

23:04.900 --> 23:07.731
[keyboard clacks]

23:09.491 --> 23:10.699
What's this?

23:10.734 --> 23:12.494
[paper rustling]

23:12.529 --> 23:14.945
[keyboard clacks]

23:14.979 --> 23:16.533
[sighs]

23:16.567 --> 23:17.982
[paper rustling]

23:21.261 --> 23:22.987
Oh!

23:23.022 --> 23:24.920
Uh, er...

23:26.888 --> 23:30.236
Carol's a, a very good,
hard working girl.

23:30.270 --> 23:33.066
Oh, she is! Isn't she, Bill?

23:33.101 --> 23:35.552
She never stops working.

23:35.586 --> 23:37.243
But she has to, you know.

23:37.277 --> 23:39.003
Is she renting here?

23:39.038 --> 23:40.108
Oh, no, dear.

23:40.142 --> 23:41.627
This is our house.

23:41.661 --> 23:44.733
Mine and my poor late Bill's.

23:44.768 --> 23:47.633
Carol has been saving up
so that she can move out.

23:47.667 --> 23:49.220
Oh, not that we mind her here.

23:49.255 --> 23:50.981
Oh, she's a great help.

23:51.015 --> 23:55.226
Does all the cooking,
takes care of Bill when I'm out.

23:55.261 --> 23:58.264
And she looks after me
and all me friends.

23:58.298 --> 24:02.475
We can't be paying salons
to be dealing with our bunions.

24:02.510 --> 24:03.545
[chuckles]

24:03.580 --> 24:06.099
Oh, she's a saint is my Carol.

24:06.134 --> 24:08.239
Part of me hopes
she never leaves!

24:08.274 --> 24:11.242
[mellow music]

24:13.210 --> 24:14.901
I'm going to grab
my stuff from the lockers.

24:14.936 --> 24:16.524
Have you left anything
in the treatment room?

24:16.558 --> 24:18.767
- No, I'm good.
- Okay.

24:29.157 --> 24:32.091
[suspenseful music]

24:37.752 --> 24:40.824
[women cheering]

24:51.559 --> 24:53.664
Did she ever mention Nuala?

24:53.699 --> 24:56.356
I-I believe she was one
of her regular clients.

24:56.391 --> 25:00.050
I just know that
she saw her on Tuesdays.

25:00.084 --> 25:03.536
Because Carol was always
late getting home on Tuesdays.

25:03.571 --> 25:07.816
And I needed my ingrown
toenail done last Tuesday.

25:07.851 --> 25:09.093
[breathes shakily]

25:09.128 --> 25:11.233
Oh, you will help her,
won't you?

25:11.268 --> 25:15.341
God, if the police arrested her,
I don't know what I'd do.

25:15.375 --> 25:16.584
[sniffles]

25:16.618 --> 25:18.206
Oh, poor Bill.

25:18.240 --> 25:22.797
He'd be spinning in his urn
thinking of me alone.

25:22.831 --> 25:25.109
Well, we'll do our best, Marian.

25:25.144 --> 25:26.214
[inhales sharply]

25:26.248 --> 25:29.182
[unsettling music]

25:31.357 --> 25:32.841
I know what you did.

25:34.153 --> 25:38.640
I don't want to rat you out, she
wasn't a... good person, but...

25:40.746 --> 25:42.092
I need money.

25:44.094 --> 25:47.373
We should try to get Carol
emergency housing.

25:47.407 --> 25:48.408
Bunions!

25:48.443 --> 25:49.962
Cooking dinner every night!

25:49.996 --> 25:52.067
Minding her dead father's ashes?

25:52.102 --> 25:55.001
My heart almost stopped
when I saw her ma.

25:55.036 --> 25:56.934
We have got to stop doing that.

25:56.969 --> 25:58.073
Breaking in?

25:58.108 --> 25:59.350
How would we
ever learn anything?

25:59.385 --> 26:00.904
Well, what did we learn?

26:00.938 --> 26:02.353
I'm not some genius
hacker, you know.

26:02.388 --> 26:05.080
I can't just hit a bunch
of keys and say, "I'm in."

26:05.115 --> 26:06.288
[laughs]

26:11.915 --> 26:13.123
I found something.

26:13.157 --> 26:15.435
[paper rustling]

26:15.470 --> 26:17.299
Carol's credit card statement.

26:20.268 --> 26:22.235
800 euro to the beauty salon!

26:23.961 --> 26:25.653
Wait, 800...

26:25.687 --> 26:27.344
Wasn't that the
cost of Elaine's hen?

26:27.378 --> 26:30.140
Th-th-the one that Nuala
was supposed to have paid for.

26:30.174 --> 26:31.935
And there's more,
on the next page.

26:31.969 --> 26:34.006
[paper rustling]

26:34.040 --> 26:38.113
She was paying the salon
a 100 quid every Tuesday.

26:38.148 --> 26:40.737
And we know that Carol was
treating Nuala every Tuesday.

26:40.771 --> 26:45.189
So, she was paying for Nuala's
treatments with her own card.

26:45.224 --> 26:48.261
Why would a woman who works
every hour God sends be

26:48.296 --> 26:51.644
paying for someone else's
appointments in her own salon?

26:51.679 --> 26:53.266
Well, she couldn't
put free treatments

26:53.301 --> 26:55.337
through on the salon's books!

26:55.372 --> 26:56.960
They had to be paid for.

26:56.994 --> 26:59.238
[Fergus]
But why were they free?

26:59.272 --> 27:03.173
If Nuala was the sort to get
somebody fired from their job...

27:03.207 --> 27:06.072
She could have had
it in her to blackmail.

27:06.107 --> 27:07.315
[sighs]

27:07.349 --> 27:11.250
Those hours that Carol works
at night, her moonlighting.

27:11.284 --> 27:12.700
What's wrong with that?

27:12.734 --> 27:15.288
Uh, employers
have a problem with it.

27:15.323 --> 27:16.773
I think
Nuala threatened to tell

27:16.807 --> 27:18.464
the salon about
her double jobbing.

27:18.498 --> 27:20.397
So, Carol killed Nuala?

27:20.431 --> 27:21.985
[laughs]

27:22.019 --> 27:23.814
Wouldn't it be nice
if all our cases

27:23.849 --> 27:25.989
were bish, bash, bosh,
she did it.

27:26.023 --> 27:27.922
[scoffs]

27:27.956 --> 27:29.820
Nah.

27:29.855 --> 27:31.097
I don't buy it, Fergus.

27:31.132 --> 27:34.031
[engine revving]

27:38.242 --> 27:39.416
Two raspberries!

27:39.450 --> 27:40.900
It took me two minutes
checking those

27:40.935 --> 27:42.384
crime scene photos to see that.

27:42.419 --> 27:43.938
So how did you miss it?

27:43.972 --> 27:46.906
To be fair, sir, we knew
the poison was in the glass.

27:46.941 --> 27:48.149
We just didn't know
how it got in.

27:48.183 --> 27:50.013
Well, it's bloody obvious,
isn't it?

27:50.047 --> 27:52.360
Carol Collins must have slipped
a second raspberry in.

27:52.394 --> 27:53.741
And nobody saw.

27:53.775 --> 27:55.259
Well, we'll bring her in
for questioning tonight.

27:55.294 --> 27:57.434
And we're just waiting on
a warrant to search the house.

27:57.468 --> 27:59.022
You know we're
about ten minutes away

27:59.056 --> 28:01.541
from my mother
solving this, folks?

28:01.576 --> 28:04.303
Can we just, this once,
be ahead of the game?

28:04.337 --> 28:05.891
[intriguing music]

28:07.478 --> 28:09.411
[footsteps]

28:09.446 --> 28:11.690

28:19.594 --> 28:20.837
[clinking]

28:20.871 --> 28:22.252
[Marian]Carol!

28:28.568 --> 28:31.088
[suspenseful music]

28:39.510 --> 28:40.926
[liquid burbling]

28:54.422 --> 28:56.286
[instrumental music]

28:56.320 --> 28:59.254
[phone buzzing]

29:02.568 --> 29:05.260
Jordan? What is it?

29:05.295 --> 29:08.160
Carol and her mother are dead.

29:08.194 --> 29:09.264
Poisoned.

29:11.266 --> 29:13.096
Carol and her mother.

29:13.130 --> 29:14.891
Jesus!

29:14.925 --> 29:17.997
We found a discarded bottle
of botulinum in the bin.

29:18.032 --> 29:19.965
We can't rule out
a murder suicide.

29:19.999 --> 29:23.554
Which would make it very likely
that she killed Nuala.

29:23.589 --> 29:25.591
Oh, you hardly believe that!

29:25.625 --> 29:26.937
You really think that Carol put

29:26.972 --> 29:29.491
a, a second raspberry
in that glass?

29:29.526 --> 29:31.148
Wait, you saw that?

29:31.183 --> 29:32.874
That's how the boss--

29:32.909 --> 29:34.496
I-I mean, that's how
Charlie figured out

29:34.531 --> 29:35.912
where the poison had come from.

29:35.946 --> 29:38.846
I, I did suggest that
we work together.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.468
Yeah, and
I'm more than happy to.

29:40.502 --> 29:42.401
- It's just that--
- Jordan!

29:42.435 --> 29:43.643
[inhales sharply]

29:43.678 --> 29:45.576
Look, if you want
to make a deal, Jordan,

29:45.611 --> 29:48.165
Vicky and Charlie
don't need to know.

29:48.200 --> 29:51.790
Erm, yeah, well, look,
I'll-I'll get back to you, sir.

29:55.448 --> 29:57.450
[sighs]

29:57.485 --> 29:58.866
Do you think
she could have done it

29:58.900 --> 30:02.076
and then killed herself
and her mam?

30:02.110 --> 30:03.318
I don't buy it.

30:03.353 --> 30:06.597
If she killed Nuala because
she was being blackmailed...

30:06.632 --> 30:08.599
then her biggest
problem was gone.

30:08.634 --> 30:10.291
Why would she kill
herself and her mother?

30:10.325 --> 30:13.294
Okay, so, the real killer came
after her? But why?

30:13.328 --> 30:16.469
I mean, did the killer think
that Carol knew something?

30:16.504 --> 30:18.506
I don't know.

30:18.540 --> 30:22.544
I mean, why not
kill Carol right away?

30:22.579 --> 30:24.270
[unsettling music]

30:24.305 --> 30:26.445
Carol must have
figured something out.

30:26.479 --> 30:28.343
And the killer realized it.

30:28.378 --> 30:31.968
If she figured it out,
why wouldn't she call us?

40:07.025 --> 40:08.060
[sniffles]

40:08.095 --> 40:10.235
I barely knew her.

40:10.269 --> 40:13.480
I couldn't face having
another woman having

40:13.514 --> 40:16.241
something on me that
could ruin my life again.

40:16.275 --> 40:18.864
[music continues]

40:18.899 --> 40:22.627
I swear, I didn't
mean to kill her mother!

40:22.661 --> 40:25.595
[Elaine]
Oh my God, Molly!

40:25.630 --> 40:27.597
How could you ruin my wedding?

40:27.632 --> 40:30.980
- Elaine! Elaine!
- Bitch!

40:31.014 --> 40:32.568
You bitch!

40:32.602 --> 40:34.673
- Elaine!
- You bitch!

40:34.708 --> 40:36.054
- Jesus!
- Molly!

40:36.088 --> 40:38.056
[yelling]

40:38.090 --> 40:39.540
Jordan? Now.

40:39.575 --> 40:41.853
- This is so dumb!
- Yes.

40:41.887 --> 40:44.165
[Ruth]
Elaine, calm down!

40:48.618 --> 40:49.964
[clears throat]

40:52.588 --> 40:54.900
Go on, then, indulge me.

40:54.935 --> 40:56.764
How did they solve it?

40:56.799 --> 40:59.042
Good old fashioned police work.

40:59.077 --> 41:01.666
I spotted a second raspberry,
Jordan put the rest together.

41:01.700 --> 41:04.669
- Wow!
- Don't take it too hard.

41:05.911 --> 41:07.534
I've trained them well.

41:07.568 --> 41:09.328
[car engine starts]

41:09.363 --> 41:13.022
You're not seriously letting
them take the credit, are ya?

41:13.056 --> 41:16.577
Having Jordan lend
us a hand is useful.

41:16.612 --> 41:18.717
Well, what do
you want, Fergus? Fame or money?

41:18.752 --> 41:19.891
How about both?

41:19.925 --> 41:21.237
[scoffs]

41:21.271 --> 41:24.171
I really have a lot of
work to do with you, don't I?

41:26.276 --> 41:28.969
[theme music]

41:58.239 --> 42:01.173
[music continues]
