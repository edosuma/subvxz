WEBVTT

00:03.605 --> 00:05.106
(gentle piano music playing)

00:09.744 --> 00:11.580
Yeah.

00:11.613 --> 00:12.747
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

00:12.781 --> 00:13.982
That's the one.
Yeah?

00:14.015 --> 00:14.983
Uh-huh.
Thank you.

00:15.016 --> 00:17.485
Jimmy, I got to tell you,
this place is awesome.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.653
How'd you find it?

00:18.687 --> 00:20.054
Oh, that's a funny
story, actually.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.489
I was driving to work...

00:21.522 --> 00:22.657
Eh. You don't have a job.

00:22.691 --> 00:23.725
Okay. Fine.

00:23.758 --> 00:25.827
I was driving to the
store, and this...

00:25.860 --> 00:27.662
Well, now I feel like
you're lying.

00:27.696 --> 00:29.163
Hey, could you just
listen, please?
Okay. Yeah.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.199
All right. Fine.
I'm driving somewhere.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.667
Okay. Good enough.

00:32.701 --> 00:34.168
And this greasy goombah...

00:34.202 --> 00:35.770
Okay. Geez, Jimmy.

00:35.804 --> 00:37.505
It's an Italian restaurant.
Lower your voice.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.173
Oh, sorry.

00:39.207 --> 00:41.209
Okay. This greasy goombah

00:41.242 --> 00:43.177
cuts me off out
of nowhere, right?
Yeah.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.512
Okay, so I start
following him.

00:44.545 --> 00:45.847
And I'm yelling at him
to pull over, right?

00:45.880 --> 00:47.515
Then he pulls into
a parking lot.

00:47.548 --> 00:48.783
I jump out. I grab
the tire iron.

00:48.817 --> 00:50.585
I'm gonna tune him up.
Hmm.

00:50.619 --> 00:52.520
And then it hits me.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.188
This smell.

00:54.222 --> 00:57.191
And I'm like,
"That's good.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.594
That's, like,
real good."
Oh.

00:59.628 --> 01:01.262
So I forget the goombah,
and I run in here,

01:01.295 --> 01:03.798
and I put my name down
with the doorwoman.

01:03.832 --> 01:06.200
The hostess?
I don't know, Mick.
The broad in the front.

01:06.234 --> 01:08.202
Oh.

01:08.236 --> 01:10.238
Well, that is,
uh, yeah.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.106
That's quite a story. Okay.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.108
All right. Well, uh, look,

01:14.142 --> 01:16.577
regardless of how we got here,
I'm having a really good time.

01:16.611 --> 01:17.979
It's really nice of you.
Thanks.

01:18.012 --> 01:20.715
Yeah? Well, you know, still got
a little speed on my fastball.

01:20.749 --> 01:21.816
Guess so.
Yeah.

01:21.850 --> 01:23.718
For the lady,
the spaghetti bolognese.

01:23.752 --> 01:24.886
Thank you.

01:24.919 --> 01:26.287
And for you,
the veal scalloppini.
Geez.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.555
Yeah.
Buon appetito.
Wow.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.823
Buon appetito.

01:28.857 --> 01:30.091
Oh, my God, Jimmy.

01:30.124 --> 01:32.560
Do you see how beautiful
my spaghetti is?

01:32.593 --> 01:33.995
Yeah, I've never seen anything
like that in my life.

01:34.028 --> 01:36.064
You know what?
I don't care if it's douchey.

01:36.097 --> 01:37.565
I'm-a take a picture
of this spaghetti.

01:37.598 --> 01:38.599
Yeah, document it.
I'm not judging.
Yeah.

01:38.633 --> 01:39.668
I'm going to.

01:39.701 --> 01:40.769
Yeah.

01:40.802 --> 01:42.003
Get it real good.

01:42.036 --> 01:43.271
Say "cheese."

01:43.304 --> 01:44.906
(gasps)
Oh!

01:44.939 --> 01:46.074
Mick.

01:46.107 --> 01:48.276
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
What the hell?!

01:48.309 --> 01:50.278
I thought it would be funny
and ruin the photo, okay?

01:50.311 --> 01:51.746
How was that funny, Jimmy?!

01:51.780 --> 01:52.914
I was gonna
scramble the noodle,

01:52.947 --> 01:54.015
flip a meatball or something.

01:54.048 --> 01:56.017
What?
I didn't mean to ruin the dress

01:56.050 --> 01:57.018
or the night, okay?

01:57.051 --> 01:58.119
Turn around!
(groans)

01:58.152 --> 01:59.120
I'm sorry.
All right.
You know what?

01:59.153 --> 02:00.121
Just get up.
We're going.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.155
No. Stop, stop, stop.
Sit down.

02:01.189 --> 02:02.290
I am leaving now.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.624
Hey. That's $40
worth of spaghetti.

02:03.658 --> 02:04.993
Well, enjoy your date
with your spaghetti.

02:05.026 --> 02:06.294
I'm taking the car
and going home.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.596
Okay, Mick, come here.
Sit down! Mick.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.099
Come on. S...
Ah, screw it.

02:11.132 --> 02:12.934
Oh, that's hot!

02:12.967 --> 02:14.969
Hot! Hot! Oh! Oh!

02:15.003 --> 02:17.872
(muffled grunting)

02:17.906 --> 02:19.173
(choking)

02:19.207 --> 02:20.975
Mick! Help!

02:22.310 --> 02:25.046
Seriously?
(gasping)

02:25.079 --> 02:27.215
Will someone do something?

02:29.217 --> 02:30.785
(patrons gasping)
You okay?

02:30.819 --> 02:32.787
There you go.

02:32.821 --> 02:35.323
Did you have that in your hand
the whole time?

02:37.258 --> 02:39.694
A gentleman never
abandons his drink.

02:41.095 --> 02:42.196
(sighs)

02:42.230 --> 02:44.065
Teddy Grant.

02:44.098 --> 02:45.967
Mm.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.668
We're through, Jimbo.

02:50.038 --> 02:52.707
Then he invited me
to dinner on his boat.

02:52.741 --> 02:53.842
(chuckles)

02:53.875 --> 02:55.043
There's nothing
more suspicious than a man

02:55.076 --> 02:56.310
who can't live on land.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.980
Well, I'll make do. Jimmy
used to live in a car.

02:59.013 --> 03:01.716
Ooh, bum to a pirate. You're
really moving up in the world.

03:01.750 --> 03:03.317
You're dating a pirate?

03:03.351 --> 03:04.819
Does he have a hook?

03:04.853 --> 03:06.154
No. He doesn't have a hook, Ben.

03:06.187 --> 03:07.655
Because he's not a pirate.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.859
Teddy Grant is a very sexy,
sophisticated gentleman.

03:10.892 --> 03:12.160
What? Hold on. Teddy Grant?

03:12.193 --> 03:14.095
Yeah. Why? What's wrong?
Is he a diddler or something?

03:14.128 --> 03:15.897
That's dude is the heir
to a family in Greenwich

03:15.930 --> 03:18.166
that has been around
since the Revolutionary War.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.233
That boat

03:19.267 --> 03:20.234
is a 90-foot yacht.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.702
Ah! Really?

03:21.736 --> 03:23.237
Is it a joke? Are you joking?

03:23.271 --> 03:24.672
This isn't time for jokes.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.107
He is insanely
out of your league.

03:26.140 --> 03:28.676
He's not out of my league.
What are you talking about?

03:28.709 --> 03:30.745
Eh, he's old money,
I'm new money.

03:30.779 --> 03:31.679
You're no money.

03:31.712 --> 03:32.680
ALBA:
Well, I'm just happy

03:32.713 --> 03:34.215
you finally find
a man you deserve.

03:34.248 --> 03:35.850
You wasted too much time

03:35.884 --> 03:38.186
on that trash bag, Jimmy.
Yeah.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.253
(phone buzzing, Chip groans)

03:39.287 --> 03:41.722
This number keeps
hammer-calling me.

03:41.756 --> 03:43.124
What?!

03:43.157 --> 03:44.859
Wait a minute.

03:44.893 --> 03:45.994
Hello?

03:47.896 --> 03:49.697
You guys, it's Mom and Dad!

03:49.730 --> 03:50.698
BEN: Mommy!
What?
Dad!

03:50.731 --> 03:52.867
Mom?
Poodle!
Dad.

03:52.901 --> 03:54.268
Hey, Dad, can you hear me?
(static crackling)

03:54.302 --> 03:55.703
CHRISTOPHER (distorted): Be
still, Fernando. We shouldn't...

03:55.736 --> 03:56.871
POODLE: ...disgusting.
Daddy!

03:56.905 --> 03:58.039
Mother!

03:58.072 --> 03:59.373
Chip, shut up!
We can't hear them.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.142
POODLE:
Shouldn't even be...

04:01.175 --> 04:02.710
CHRISTOPHER:
Plain at the...

04:02.743 --> 04:04.745
POODLE: Go bag in the...
(beep)

04:06.815 --> 04:08.783
They're safe!

04:08.817 --> 04:09.951
They called us
to let us know

04:09.984 --> 04:11.152
that they're okay.

04:11.185 --> 04:12.386
SABRINA: They didn't
call us, you idiot.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.721
That was a butt dial.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.056
Okay. It has to
mean something,

04:15.089 --> 04:17.158
because my number
was in their phone.

04:17.191 --> 04:18.893
You know what it means?
It means that they could've

04:18.927 --> 04:20.795
been calling us this whole
time, but they haven't.

04:20.829 --> 04:22.931
How do you call somebody
with your butt?

04:22.964 --> 04:25.399
Okay, Benito, come on.
I think we go somewhere else.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.068
Thanks, Alba.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.170
All right. Guys, listen.

04:29.203 --> 04:31.472
I recognize that this
is a really big deal.

04:33.207 --> 04:35.409
But I got to figure out
an appropriate thing to wear

04:35.443 --> 04:37.278
for a boat date.

04:39.981 --> 04:41.082
Okay, Benito.

04:41.115 --> 04:43.084
Don't pay any attention to them.

04:43.117 --> 04:46.787
How about if I put
on a fun time kid's program?

04:46.821 --> 04:48.756
(gasps) Annoying Orange!
Annoying Orange!

04:48.789 --> 04:50.959
Annoying Orange!
Yeah, that
is definitely annoying.

04:50.992 --> 04:53.094
Okay. Here you go, Benito.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.495
Go on.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.931
There you go.

04:56.965 --> 04:58.499
Okay. Hmm.

05:01.169 --> 05:03.071
*

05:05.974 --> 05:07.942
TEDDY:
So here's a bunch

05:07.976 --> 05:10.444
of dials and switches.
But I'm not gonna bore you

05:10.478 --> 05:11.980
with what they all do.

05:12.013 --> 05:13.814
Do you know what they do

05:13.848 --> 05:15.349
or you got a guy for that?

05:15.383 --> 05:17.852
I know exactly what they do.

05:19.253 --> 05:21.455
I'm just kidding.
I got a guy for that.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.224
(laughs)

05:23.257 --> 05:25.159
And this is the bedroom.

05:25.193 --> 05:26.294
Hmm.

05:26.327 --> 05:27.295
(chuckles)

05:27.328 --> 05:28.997
Mm.
Ooh!

05:29.030 --> 05:31.799
You okay?
Yeah. I just get a little
seasick sometimes. It's fine.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.801
I have something for that.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.970
Oh, yeah?
You know, when you spend
as much time on a yacht

05:36.004 --> 05:38.806
as I do, you tend
to become immune

05:38.839 --> 05:40.008
to those things.
Mm-hmm.

05:40.041 --> 05:41.910
Mm. Oh.

05:41.943 --> 05:43.811
I can get you some water.
Thank you.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.980
You know, I've got to say,
I've never seen anyone

05:46.014 --> 05:47.148
get seasick
on a docked boat before...

05:47.181 --> 05:48.249
Whoa! No!

05:48.282 --> 05:49.817
Hmm?

05:49.850 --> 05:50.985
You just drink that whole thing?

05:51.019 --> 05:51.986
I mean, there's a little bit

05:52.020 --> 05:53.187
left in the bottom
if you want it.

05:53.221 --> 05:54.388
No. No. You're only
supposed to drink

05:54.422 --> 05:57.191
a capful of this thing.
Do you want to sit down?

05:57.225 --> 05:58.492
Oh, no.

05:58.526 --> 06:01.029
Don't you worry about me.
I can handle my medicine.

06:01.062 --> 06:03.031
(cackles)

06:04.899 --> 06:06.367
Oh, hello, sir!

06:06.400 --> 06:07.868
Where did you come from?

06:07.902 --> 06:09.170
(laughs)
This guy'll be like,

06:09.203 --> 06:11.505
(high-pitched voice):
"I miss my family! Put me back!"

06:11.539 --> 06:12.440
Well...
Oh, God!

06:12.473 --> 06:14.208
It's so gross, though,

06:14.242 --> 06:16.344
you know, when you touch it.

06:16.377 --> 06:17.845
Ooh!
Uh, you know, I could,

06:17.878 --> 06:19.513
I could hold off,
I could hold off for a minute.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.449
Maybe you should
hold off a minute.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.417
(both laugh)

06:23.451 --> 06:25.019
Believe this guy?
Okay, okay.

06:25.053 --> 06:26.187
(laughs)

06:26.220 --> 06:27.855
Hey, can I tell you a secret?

06:27.888 --> 06:29.557
Okay. Here's my secret.

06:29.590 --> 06:30.891
Okay.

06:30.925 --> 06:33.194
Normally, I'd be
all over this deck,

06:33.227 --> 06:34.895
just riding your brains out.

06:34.929 --> 06:37.898
But I like you. I think there's
something sweet about you.

06:37.932 --> 06:41.135
And so I want
to take it slow. Okay?

06:41.169 --> 06:43.037
Okay. Yeah.
Slow, slow-- Okay.

06:43.071 --> 06:45.139
(laughing): You don't need that.
Yeah. No, I do, I do, yes.

06:45.173 --> 06:46.307
Slow is good.
Slow is really...

06:46.340 --> 06:47.541
Why don't you have a seat?
Yeah! Yeah.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.310
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll take this.

06:49.343 --> 06:50.444
Um...
I'll take this guy.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.446
Look, um...

06:52.480 --> 06:54.482
Mickey, I like you.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.217
And-and I want
to let you know that

06:56.250 --> 06:57.585
I'm-I'm going away for a bit.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.320
Yeah.

06:59.353 --> 07:00.454
I'm, I'm going
to America's Cup.

07:00.488 --> 07:01.455
It's a sailing race.

07:01.489 --> 07:03.157
Yeah.
Look, I leave in three days.

07:03.191 --> 07:05.059
I'm gonna be gone
for a couple months.
Okay.

07:05.093 --> 07:07.061
Okay.
Okay.

07:07.095 --> 07:08.262
Yeah. Um...

07:08.296 --> 07:10.298
Me, too.

07:10.331 --> 07:11.899
Should I get you some water?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.901
Mm-mm!

07:13.934 --> 07:15.303
I'm good.

07:15.336 --> 07:17.005
You good?
Yeah.

07:17.038 --> 07:18.506
All right, I'm gonna
get you some water.
It's good. No, no, no!

07:18.539 --> 07:21.609
No. All's good.
Yeah?

07:21.642 --> 07:24.478
You know what? I'm just gonna
take a quick mosey around,

07:24.512 --> 07:27.181
find the place
where ladies go pee-pee.

07:27.215 --> 07:28.949
I'll be back in one second.

07:28.983 --> 07:30.418
It's actually inside.
Uh...

07:30.451 --> 07:32.953
(screams, water splashes)

07:32.987 --> 07:33.954
Oh, my God.
(screams)

07:33.988 --> 07:35.423
Mickey, are you okay?

07:35.456 --> 07:39.160
Oh, uh, whoopsie. Oh.

07:47.001 --> 07:48.602
Oh, you guys.

07:48.636 --> 07:51.105
I made a real ass out of myself.

07:51.139 --> 07:52.940
And he's leaving in three days.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.642
No. Do not give up, Miss Mickey.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.510
You cannot got back to Jimmy

07:56.544 --> 07:57.978
and his smells.
I can't wait

07:58.012 --> 07:59.647
till Mom and Dad get back home
so I don't have to listen

07:59.680 --> 08:01.549
to these inane conversations
anymore.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.117
They are not coming home.

08:03.151 --> 08:04.518
How can you say that?

08:04.552 --> 08:06.454
Hey, guys, come on.
We got to stick together.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.656
I know this is a really tough
situation.

08:08.689 --> 08:11.292
It's not a tough situation.
It's very straightforward.

08:11.325 --> 08:13.661
They're not coming
back. Okay? (scoffs)

08:13.694 --> 08:15.696
What are we even talking about?

08:15.729 --> 08:17.465
You know what? I'm moving
into their bedroom.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.300
No frickin' way.
Well, hold-hold on.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.001
Don't go crazy. You're not
moving into my bedroom.

08:21.035 --> 08:23.204
(laugh) Oh. Obviously not.
Your bedroom is gross.

08:23.237 --> 08:24.672
I'm taking the master.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.474
I thought I was in the master.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.676
(laughing):
Oh! Mickey.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.145
This is the master.

08:31.179 --> 08:32.413
MICKEY:
What?! Where has this been?

08:32.446 --> 08:34.415
SABRINA: Well, maybe you should
broaden your horizons

08:34.448 --> 08:36.217
beyond your bedroom
and the refrigerator.

08:36.250 --> 08:38.252
Oh, I'm-a rip Teddy
to shreds in here.

08:38.286 --> 08:40.321
Nobody's ripping anybody
to shreds in here.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.090
Okay? Get away from that!
Put that down.

08:42.123 --> 08:43.324
And take
your frickin' shoes off.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.392
Or what? You'll tell Mom?

08:44.425 --> 08:45.593
I'll take them off for you.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.695
Why don't I just tell Mom
myself? Hey, Mom?

08:47.728 --> 08:50.398
I'm getting mud all over
your carpet. Do you mind?

08:50.431 --> 08:52.400
Oh. Guess not.

08:52.433 --> 08:55.035
Don't touch that drawer. Okay?
Don't touch her jewelry!

08:55.069 --> 08:57.338
Don't even look at it. You're
playing a dangerous game, woman.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.173
Oh, is Little Orphan Annie
getting mad?

08:59.207 --> 09:00.408
Oh, oh.

09:00.441 --> 09:02.176
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Everybody relax.

09:02.210 --> 09:04.412
We don't need to scream at each
other in front of your brother.

09:04.445 --> 09:05.713
(dramatic music playing
on tablet)

09:07.047 --> 09:09.049
(woman screaming)

09:12.320 --> 09:13.687
I've had about
enough of this.

09:13.721 --> 09:15.456
You guys are trespassing.

09:15.489 --> 09:16.524
You know what?
He's got a good point.

09:16.557 --> 09:18.359
You guys are trespassing.
Please go.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.627
Yeah. That's cute.
I'm the oldest Pemberton.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.061
This room is mine.

09:21.095 --> 09:23.364
Well, I'm your leader.
So this room is mine.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.598
Yeah. Well,
I'm the man of the house,

09:24.632 --> 09:26.367
and I say no one gets it.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.735
You already have a room.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.603
Hmm, my room sucks.
I'm gonna take this one.

09:29.637 --> 09:31.705
Well, Mom and Dad are coming
home, and I can prove it.

09:31.739 --> 09:34.375
"Well, Mom and Dad are coming
home, and I can prove it."

09:34.408 --> 09:36.377
I'm serious.
I have hard evidence.

09:36.410 --> 09:37.478
What are you talking about?

09:37.511 --> 09:39.380
I record all my phone calls.

09:39.413 --> 09:40.414
What?

09:40.448 --> 09:41.482
Creepy.

09:41.515 --> 09:42.716
Is it? Is it creepy

09:42.750 --> 09:44.752
to be ahead of everybody
at all times?

09:44.785 --> 09:46.487
Yeah.
Definitely.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.721
No.

09:47.755 --> 09:49.390
All righty.

09:49.423 --> 09:51.259
Okay.

09:51.292 --> 09:53.227
How much time
did you spend on that?

09:53.261 --> 09:55.163
More time than you've spent
on anything in your life.

09:55.196 --> 09:58.266
First, we will listen
to this call as a group.

09:58.299 --> 10:01.469
Second, we will isolate
each and every noise

10:01.502 --> 10:03.604
that we hear.
Oh, my God. Just play it.

10:05.206 --> 10:07.275
CHIP: If I don't get that
sports channel bundle,

10:07.308 --> 10:08.642
I'm suing your family...
Okay. All right.

10:08.676 --> 10:09.743
All right, that's different.
That's different.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.078
Let's, um...

10:11.111 --> 10:12.813
Let's refocus.

10:12.846 --> 10:15.183
Okay?

10:15.216 --> 10:17.185
SABRINA: Mom?
MICKEY: Poodle.
CHIP: Dad.

10:17.218 --> 10:18.419
CHRISTOPHER: I will...
CHIP: Hey, Dad, can you hear me?

10:18.452 --> 10:20.321
CHRISTOPHER:
Please tell Fernando we...

10:20.354 --> 10:21.489
CHIP:
Daddy! Mother!

10:21.522 --> 10:23.157
SABRINA:
Chip, shut up.

10:23.191 --> 10:24.158
We can't hear them.

10:24.192 --> 10:25.159
POODLE:
We shouldn't even be...

10:25.193 --> 10:26.427
CHRISTOPHER: Plain at...
(goose squawks)

10:26.460 --> 10:27.795
POODLE:
It's... go bag in the...

10:27.828 --> 10:29.129
Okay.

10:29.163 --> 10:30.664
So what did we hear?

10:30.698 --> 10:32.533
I heard a sad little boy
whose mommy doesn't love him.

10:32.566 --> 10:34.702
I heard the honk
of a goose.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.170
I think it was
the honk of a horn.

10:36.204 --> 10:37.538
You're actually both right.

10:37.571 --> 10:39.673
There was a goose honk
and a foghorn.

10:39.707 --> 10:43.177
Also, the words "Fernando,"
"plane," and "go-bag."

10:43.211 --> 10:45.546
Now, I did some research,
and most of the world's

10:45.579 --> 10:49.683
major ports with native geese
are in South America,

10:49.717 --> 10:52.820
which lines up with Fernando.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.323
And where did Mom and Dad go
on their honeymoon?

10:56.490 --> 10:58.192
Chile.

10:58.226 --> 10:59.827
So you think Mom and Dad
are in Chile?

10:59.860 --> 11:02.129
No. But they were.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.131
But between go-bags and plane,

11:04.164 --> 11:06.200
I think Fernando
smuggled them out of Chile

11:06.234 --> 11:08.168
and is bringing them home.

11:10.871 --> 11:11.839
MICKEY:
Okay.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.807
I guess that settles it.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.343
I'm moving into the master.

11:16.844 --> 11:20.548
So I think this new bedroom
will be a good thing

11:20.581 --> 11:22.483
for you and ocean man Teddy.

11:22.516 --> 11:23.651
I don't know, Alba.
I told you,

11:23.684 --> 11:24.752
I went full beast mode
on our date.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.254
I'm not sure he's into it.

11:26.287 --> 11:29.189
But you've come so far
from that tragedy man Jimmy.

11:29.223 --> 11:30.324
You must try.

11:30.358 --> 11:31.659
You really hate Jimmy, huh?

11:31.692 --> 11:33.227
He is dog.

11:33.261 --> 11:35.162
All right. Well, I don't know
what you want me to do.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.665
You need to bring Teddy up
to the boom-bang room,

11:37.698 --> 11:40.601
and you need... just... and...

11:40.634 --> 11:43.371
and then... and then...

11:44.538 --> 11:45.739
Oh... (teeth clatter)

11:45.773 --> 11:47.741
You know, seal the deal.

11:47.775 --> 11:49.777
Yeah. I want all of that.
Hmm.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.279
But I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

11:51.312 --> 11:53.347
He hasn't called me.
Well, then, call him.

11:53.381 --> 11:55.449
Me call him?
Have you lost your mind?

11:55.483 --> 11:56.850
Oh. I know, I know.

11:56.884 --> 11:59.387
You can, uh,
by accident, call him.

11:59.420 --> 12:00.521
You know, you
put the phone

12:00.554 --> 12:01.622
by the butt.

12:01.655 --> 12:02.756
It makes the call.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.392
Like Christopher and Poodle did.

12:04.425 --> 12:05.393
The old butt-dial.

12:05.426 --> 12:06.627
Butt-dial, yeah.

12:06.660 --> 12:07.728
Hmm.

12:12.766 --> 12:13.801
I don't know, Mickey.
This is a bit intense.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.235
Okay, maybe this is not
the time to be subtle.

12:15.269 --> 12:16.704
It's too late now.
Just come on.

12:16.737 --> 12:19.307
Thanks again for
waxing my bikini line,

12:19.340 --> 12:21.475
like you do every
single week, Marta.

12:21.509 --> 12:23.877
Sure. You are my
favorite waxing client.

12:23.911 --> 12:26.213
You make this job
an absolute joy.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.915
Oh, by the way,
how did the date go?

12:27.948 --> 12:29.750
Well, not great.
Thanks for asking.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.385
I think I was just
really nervous.

12:31.419 --> 12:34.555
It didn't help that I was so
exhausted from all those Kegels.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.223
Sure. Well, your hard work
has paid off,

12:36.256 --> 12:37.925
because in over 30 years
in this business,

12:37.958 --> 12:40.661
I have never seen a more
perfect downstairs on a lady.

12:40.694 --> 12:42.296
Hm. Thanks, Marta.

12:42.330 --> 12:45.232
It is so soft,
and young and supple,

12:45.265 --> 12:47.735
like the neck of a turkey.

12:47.768 --> 12:48.936
Ooh... ooh...

12:48.969 --> 12:52.573
I-I mean, it's just that
I wish Teddy could find it

12:52.606 --> 12:54.508
in his heart to give me
a second chance.

12:54.542 --> 12:56.410
That's mine! That's mine!
(coughs)

12:56.444 --> 12:58.579
I swallowed a frog.
(clears throat)

12:58.612 --> 13:00.914
I wish I could... Teddy could
find it in his heart

13:00.948 --> 13:03.283
to give me a second chance.
(whispers inaudibly)

13:03.317 --> 13:04.918
Anyway, uh, thanks
for letting me

13:04.952 --> 13:06.587
pour my heart out
to you, Marta.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.922
I love you equally as
a friend and an employee.

13:08.956 --> 13:12.025
Sure. And I love listening
to your many, many problems.

13:13.727 --> 13:15.763
I...
I want to squeeze you
around your neck

13:15.796 --> 13:17.431
until you can't
breathe anymore.
I just...

13:17.465 --> 13:19.266
So you thought saying that

13:19.299 --> 13:21.835
it resembled the neck
of a turkey would be...

13:21.869 --> 13:23.437
They are majestic animals.

13:23.471 --> 13:25.806
I can't even wrap my mind
around what that means.

13:25.839 --> 13:28.476
In my country,
it's a real high compliment.

13:28.509 --> 13:30.511
Is that what... Oh!
(cell phone ringing)

13:30.544 --> 13:32.846
(screams)
Oh, oh!

13:32.880 --> 13:35.883
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!

13:35.916 --> 13:37.317
Hello?

13:37.351 --> 13:40.454
Oh, hey, stranger.

13:40.488 --> 13:42.690
(laughing)

13:44.057 --> 13:46.627
God, I'm still so embarrassed
about the butt dial.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.462
Sorry about that.

13:48.496 --> 13:49.897
It's a shame I'm going so soon.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.700
Yeah. It really is.
It really is.

13:52.733 --> 13:56.837
I think we're just gonna have
to kick things up a notch.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.739
What happened
to taking things slowly?

13:58.772 --> 14:00.374
Oh, that? No.

14:00.408 --> 14:02.476
That was, that was so stupid.

14:02.510 --> 14:04.478
I said that forever ago,
when I was young and dumb.

14:04.512 --> 14:05.746
But I'm not that anymore.

14:05.779 --> 14:08.315
Now I'm old and wise.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.483
Hmm, no, not old.

14:09.517 --> 14:10.884
(laughs)
I'm wise.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.586
And young and hot.

14:13.921 --> 14:15.656
Guess what?

14:15.689 --> 14:16.890
What?

14:16.924 --> 14:19.693
I just got dibs on a brand-new
master bedroom

14:19.727 --> 14:23.030
that I didn't even know existed.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.766
I don't know what that means,
but... I'm in.

14:28.536 --> 14:31.539
Oh, come on.

14:47.421 --> 14:49.389
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

14:49.423 --> 14:51.459
Settling in.
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:51.492 --> 14:53.594
Did I forget
to take my shoes off?

14:54.995 --> 14:56.864
(yells)

14:56.897 --> 14:59.032
Oh... my God!

14:59.066 --> 15:00.601
Show some respect!

15:00.634 --> 15:02.369
(grunting)

15:02.402 --> 15:03.804
Idiot.

15:04.838 --> 15:06.640
(grunts)
(yells)

15:06.674 --> 15:08.375
(glass shatters)

15:08.408 --> 15:10.077
No face shots.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.545
(screams)

15:11.579 --> 15:12.780
(grunts)

15:12.813 --> 15:14.815
That was my face,
you... (grunts)

15:14.848 --> 15:18.385
(grunting)

15:18.418 --> 15:20.988
(slow, distorted shouting)

15:22.856 --> 15:25.425
(grunting)

15:28.962 --> 15:32.432
I'm going to kill you.
I'll kill you more.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.035
(slow, distorted grunting)

15:38.939 --> 15:41.775
(slow, distorted grunting)

15:43.477 --> 15:45.412
SABRINA: You like that?
Remind you of Mommy, Chip?

15:45.445 --> 15:47.114
(muffled):
Alba! (screams)

15:47.147 --> 15:50.083
(muffled):
Alba! Alba!

15:50.117 --> 15:52.820
(muffled): No! Come back!
That's right, come here.

15:52.853 --> 15:55.188
(muffled screams)

15:56.857 --> 15:58.959
(grunts)

15:58.992 --> 16:00.193
(groans)

16:01.962 --> 16:03.163
(screaming)
(yelling)

16:04.532 --> 16:07.100
Well, if it isn't
the two little pigs.

16:07.134 --> 16:08.602
They wrote a story
about you guys.

16:08.636 --> 16:10.170
That's the three little pigs.

16:10.203 --> 16:11.839
Oh. Well, you're the expert.

16:11.872 --> 16:14.508
Who are they?

16:14.542 --> 16:15.943
Why, are you jealous?

16:15.976 --> 16:17.477
(laughs)

16:18.646 --> 16:20.781
(grunts)
Oh!

16:20.814 --> 16:22.716
(grunts)
(glass shatters)

16:23.751 --> 16:25.953
Hey, hey!
All right! Stop it!

16:25.986 --> 16:27.688
What are you doing?

16:27.721 --> 16:29.456
Okay, Chip.
Chip.
What the hell?

16:29.489 --> 16:31.625
Hey, you guys stop it
right now!
Oh, my God. No.

16:31.659 --> 16:33.794
(grunting)
Whoa, hey,
knock it off.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.663
Walk away!
I'll kill you!

16:37.064 --> 16:39.533
(slow, distorted shouting)

16:39.567 --> 16:41.902
(grunting)

16:44.504 --> 16:46.840
(yells)

16:48.008 --> 16:49.142
CHIP:
Oh, my God.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.211
Oh, my God,
I think I killed her.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.480
(screams):
Sabrina!

16:53.513 --> 16:55.683
(high-pitched crying)

16:55.716 --> 16:57.084
(slow, distorted shouting)

16:57.117 --> 16:59.820
Oh! Oh, okay,
okay, okay, okay.

16:59.853 --> 17:00.921
No, no, just...

17:00.954 --> 17:02.756
(screams)

17:02.790 --> 17:04.992
Oh, no.
What did you do?

17:05.025 --> 17:07.661
I didn't mean to do it.
I didn't mean it!

17:07.695 --> 17:10.731
Pull it out!
Alba!

17:10.764 --> 17:13.000
No, no, no. Bed, bed, bed.
Go away.

17:13.033 --> 17:14.201
You get out of here.
You shouldn't see this.

17:14.234 --> 17:15.903
(whimpering)

17:16.870 --> 17:18.071
(both screaming)

17:18.105 --> 17:22.042
(screaming)

17:22.075 --> 17:24.745
Cool.
(screaming continues)

17:24.778 --> 17:27.114
Okay, I think he'd like me
to travel with him.

17:27.147 --> 17:30.250
So I can operate... I can
operate this, I can do it.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.953
Okay. You are really...

17:32.986 --> 17:34.521
Get that woman
away from me!

17:34.554 --> 17:36.857
Uh, just call me. If they...

17:36.890 --> 17:38.191
Uh...
(whimpering)

17:38.225 --> 17:40.527
If they give you
a glass eye, you just...
Get away!

17:40.560 --> 17:43.230
Get away!
Okay. Okay. I'll wait for you.

17:43.263 --> 17:46.199
Sorry. All right,
good luck. You call me.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.836
We'll do a rain check. Okay?
(Teddy cries out)

17:53.573 --> 17:55.242
(breathing heavily)

17:55.275 --> 17:57.778
(phone buzzing)

18:00.848 --> 18:02.883
Damn it, they called again
when we were fighting.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.551
Oh, just play it.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.119
(phone beeps)

18:06.153 --> 18:07.655
(passionate moaning over phone)
Oh, my God, is that...?

18:07.688 --> 18:09.623
Fast forward.
Fast forward.

18:11.091 --> 18:14.294
POODLE:
Oh, so overweight.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.829
CHRISTOPHER:
Well, you're an alcoholic.

18:15.863 --> 18:18.565
Is that to-go bag with that
salad still in the fridge?

18:18.598 --> 18:20.167
POODLE:
Oh, God. You just ate a pizza.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.601
CHRISTOPHER:
Well, it was very plain.

18:21.635 --> 18:22.903
I'm calling downstairs
to the front desk.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.071
POODLE: Can't you just
leave them alone?

18:24.104 --> 18:25.172
CHRISTOPHER:
What are you talking about?

18:25.205 --> 18:26.606
Fernando loves me.
(phone beeps)

18:28.108 --> 18:30.711
Maybe they're trying to
tell us something in code?

18:32.279 --> 18:34.748
Chip.

18:34.782 --> 18:38.118
Why couldn't they just call
and tell us that they miss us?

18:40.654 --> 18:42.189
You know what?
Screw them. Okay?

18:42.222 --> 18:44.057
I'm here.

18:45.292 --> 18:48.295
You're right.
Screw them.

18:48.328 --> 18:51.331
You should take the room.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.903
Nah, I'm good.

19:03.911 --> 19:06.613
Hey. You looking for Chris
and Poodle Pemberton?

19:06.646 --> 19:09.016
This is a direct line. Enjoy.

19:11.251 --> 19:14.254
(dramatic music,
screaming)

19:19.026 --> 19:20.627
Ben, are you watching Alien?

19:20.660 --> 19:22.863
Oh, come on, man.

19:22.896 --> 19:25.632
Aliens is a way
better movie.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.300
I didn't know.
(scoffs)

19:27.334 --> 19:30.670
Jimmy, we're watching Aliens.
I'll show you.

19:30.704 --> 19:32.139
Give me that.

19:32.172 --> 19:35.743
That is gonna put me
in a weird space, but okay.

19:35.776 --> 19:37.210
You'll be all right.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.678
All right, you guys.

19:38.712 --> 19:40.781
Here.
Thanks.

19:45.385 --> 19:48.321

CHIP (recording):
Hey, Jen. It's Chip. (chuckles)

19:51.358 --> 19:52.826
Just calling to see what's up.

19:52.860 --> 19:54.327
MAN (recording):
Chip, this is Jennifer's dad.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.930
This is the 76th consecutive day
you've called her.
Oh.

19:56.964 --> 19:58.698
It's getting scary.
(both chuckling)

19:58.732 --> 20:01.001
I need you to never,
ever call again.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.702
Mm.
(phone chimes)

20:02.736 --> 20:04.337
Incoming call.
Okay.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.206
Ignore it and trace
the voice mail.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.209
(beeps)

20:09.242 --> 20:10.343
CHIP (recording):
You've reached Chip Pemberton.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.780
Please leave a message.

20:12.813 --> 20:14.247
CHRISTOPHER:
Hey, buddy. It's Dad.

20:14.281 --> 20:16.349
I've got to make this fast.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.685
I'm so sorry
we haven't been in touch,

20:18.718 --> 20:21.755
but it's very dangerous
for us to call.

20:21.789 --> 20:25.258
Look, I wish I could be there
for your lacrosse games.

20:25.292 --> 20:26.960
I hope that bonehead coach

20:26.994 --> 20:29.029
is giving you the playing time
you deserve.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.731
Anyway, I need you to be brave
for me, son.

20:31.765 --> 20:33.700
We don't know
when we can come home,

20:33.733 --> 20:37.204
but your mom and I care about
you kids more than anything.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.705
We'll fix this, Chip.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.374
We love you.
Mm.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.876
Did you get it?
(beeping)

20:42.910 --> 20:45.045
Got 'em.
