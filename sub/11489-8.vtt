wake up!Wake up!Wake up!

00:06.670 --> 00:08.960
I'm sorry,mom.I love you!

00:09.960 --> 00:11.890
-What?
-What?

00:12.340 --> 00:14.600
There's something you gotta see.

00:15.780 --> 00:18.740
It has to be better than my dream.

00:19.990 --> 00:20.900
Wake up!Wake up!Wake up!

00:20.900 --> 00:23.770
It's dad's magazine!

00:23.770 --> 00:25.910
-What?
-What?

00:25.910 --> 00:28.570
There's something you gotta see.

00:28.840 --> 00:32.840
I was already seeing everything I needed to see.

00:33.870 --> 00:35.140
What's going on?

00:35.140 --> 00:37.490
You remember I recorded those kids' songs a few months ago?

00:37.490 --> 00:39.630
Yeah.They sucked.

00:40.060 --> 00:40.990
Of course they sucked.

00:40.990 --> 00:43.090
They're kids' songs.

00:43.090 --> 00:45.920
Anyway,the cd is coming out,and the first commercial is about to air.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.060
At 5:00 in the morning?

00:47.060 --> 00:49.530
That's when moms with little kids are up.

00:49.530 --> 00:52.010
Oh,becker is over.I'm up next.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.420
* Who loves kids? *

00:53.420 --> 00:56.130

00:57.120 --> 00:58.890
* Who cut the cheese? *

00:58.890 --> 01:00.520
* who cut the cheese? *

01:00.520 --> 01:04.319
I ask you please,did you cut the cheese?

01:04.319 --> 01:05.400
that's right.

01:05.400 --> 01:06.770
Charlie waffles!

01:06.770 --> 01:10.530
And now you can get his greatest hits on one cd.

01:10.530 --> 01:11.800
Charlie waffles?

01:11.800 --> 01:13.040
My idea.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.700
Kids love waffles.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.640
That's true.

01:16.640 --> 01:21.240
Yes,you'll get all the melodies that made charlie waffles the king of kids' songs:

01:21.240 --> 01:26.890
"Kiss my owie," "rush to flush" and,of course,"don't shake the baby.

01:26.890 --> 01:33.770
* He's a little boy,he is not a toy don't shake,shake,*

01:33.770 --> 01:41.250
* shake the baby she's our little girl,our darling girl don't shake,shake,shake the baby.*

01:42.170 --> 01:44.720
When did you become the king of kids' songs?

01:44.720 --> 01:47.810
When did you become the federal trade commission?

01:47.810 --> 01:53.350
* Grandma may smell funny,but hug her anyway accept her stinky kisses,*

01:53.350 --> 01:59.540
* and then go out and play but she's got all the money,so you might just want to stay oh,*

01:59.540 --> 02:01.450

02:31.670 --> 02:34.270
What,they couldn't make it smell like bourbon?

02:34.270 --> 02:35.840
Operators are standing by.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.370
Give your child the gift of music.

02:38.370 --> 02:39.440
Who loves kids?

02:39.440 --> 02:41.540
Charlie waffles!

02:41.540 --> 02:43.740
Right!

02:45.170 --> 02:46.350
That's it.

02:46.350 --> 02:48.800
What do you think?

02:49.640 --> 02:52.480
I'm going back to bed.

02:52.480 --> 02:53.950
What about you?

02:53.950 --> 02:56.920
You couldn't have tivo'd this?

02:56.920 --> 03:01.600
Hey,charlie waffles may love kids,but he's getting pretty sick of you!

03:03.090 --> 03:04.280

03:36.520 --> 03:39.440
I still don't understand why you wanted to come shopping with me.

03:39.440 --> 03:40.390
I told you.

03:40.390 --> 03:41.710
I've gotta pick up something.

03:41.710 --> 03:43.270
You could've just put it to the list.

03:43.270 --> 03:46.450
Hey,maybe I just want to hang out with my brother.

03:46.450 --> 03:47.120
Really?

03:47.120 --> 03:48.230
Oh,well,that's,uh,that's a very nice...

03:48.230 --> 03:50.630
get away.Get away.Get away.

03:52.890 --> 03:55.500
Of course.

04:03.720 --> 04:04.750
Excuse me.

04:04.750 --> 04:07.440
Do you know where the chewable vitamins are?

04:07.440 --> 04:10.370
Oh,I think they're...

04:10.370 --> 04:12.520
oh,my god,you're him.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.300
I'm sorry?

04:13.300 --> 04:15.690
You're charlie waffles,right?

04:15.690 --> 04:17.290
You caught me.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.040
My daughter just loves your songs.

04:19.040 --> 04:22.920
Oh,gee,you don't know how that fills my heart.

04:22.920 --> 04:26.490
There's about to be a vomit spill on aisle three.

04:26.490 --> 04:27.780
How old is your little girl?

04:27.780 --> 04:28.700
Five.

04:28.700 --> 04:30.000
No way.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.920
What,did you have her when you were 12?

04:31.920 --> 04:33.710
-Oh,you're sweet.
-I know.

04:33.710 --> 04:35.100
Hey,she's not going to believe I met you.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.020
Can I take a picture of you?

04:37.020 --> 04:39.650
-Better still,let's take one together.
-Oh,okay.

04:39.650 --> 04:43.050
Excuse me,sir.Would you take our picture?

04:44.710 --> 04:46.780
Sir?

04:46.780 --> 04:49.660
Oh,yeah,yeah,sure.

04:51.620 --> 04:53.340
Say waffles.

04:53.340 --> 04:56.040
-Waffles!
-Waffles!

04:56.820 --> 04:57.720
Thanks,pal.

04:57.720 --> 04:59.060
Thank you.

04:59.060 --> 05:00.690
And don't let your husband see that.

05:00.690 --> 05:03.160
He might get the wrong idea about charlie waffles.

05:03.160 --> 05:04.980
Oh,there is no husband.

05:04.980 --> 05:06.340
No kidding.

05:06.340 --> 05:09.240
Oh,my god.

05:09.780 --> 05:11.090
Jodie is going to love this.

05:11.090 --> 05:12.980
I'm going to save it for her birthday.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.120
Her birthday's coming up?

05:14.120 --> 05:15.490
This weekend she'll be six.

05:15.490 --> 05:18.220
Oh,what a magical age.

05:18.220 --> 05:23.640
Tell you what,how would jodie like a free charlie waffles birthday concert?

05:23.640 --> 05:25.430
You would do that?

05:25.430 --> 05:27.210
Who loves kids?

05:27.210 --> 05:29.600
Charlie waffles.

05:29.600 --> 05:30.890
Right.

05:30.890 --> 05:33.210
Call me.

05:34.800 --> 05:35.980
Oh,look,it's got a little waffle on it.

05:35.980 --> 05:38.750
How adorable.

05:40.150 --> 05:43.250
Told you I had to pick something up.

05:45.630 --> 05:49.330
* Grandma may smell funny,but hug her anyway *

05:49.330 --> 05:53.180
accept her stinky kisses, and then go out and play

05:53.180 --> 05:57.320
* but she's got all the money,so you might just want to stay oh,*

05:57.320 --> 06:03.230
* grandma may smell funny,but hug her anyway hug her anyway she's old,*

06:03.230 --> 06:08.020
* hug her anyway she stinks,hug her anyway she's rich,hug her anyway...*

06:08.020 --> 06:09.670
pretty catchy,huh?

06:09.670 --> 06:12.080
So is gonorrhea.

06:12.750 --> 06:15.240
Drinking from the well of bitterness,are we?

06:15.240 --> 06:20.630
I just don't understand what kind of spiteful god could allow my drunken whoremonger of a brother

06:20.630 --> 06:25.810
to become a children's singing star while I to toil away in poverty-stricken anonymity?

06:25.810 --> 06:30.300
You want to talk to me about toiling away in poverty-stricken anonymity?

06:30.300 --> 06:32.690
No.Sorry.

06:32.690 --> 06:34.380
I'm sure you've got it worse than I do.

06:34.380 --> 06:37.670
Whoa,whoa,I wouldn't go that far.

06:39.140 --> 06:41.900
What I'm trying to say is there's another way to look at this.

06:41.900 --> 06:43.080
What's that?

06:43.080 --> 06:44.970
We're all in this together.

06:44.970 --> 06:47.020
Your brother's success is our success.

06:47.020 --> 06:48.650
His home is our home.

06:48.650 --> 06:53.490
And most importantly,when he's got a load on,his car is my car.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.850
Hey,berta,guess what?

06:58.130 --> 06:59.880
I got another big royalty check.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.160
Oh,honey,good for you.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.020
Why don't you celebrate with a drink?

07:04.020 --> 07:06.530
I think I will.

07:07.630 --> 07:08.960
Hey,alan,guess what?

07:08.960 --> 07:10.180
Yeah,I heard.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.690
Another big check.

07:11.690 --> 07:13.680
Yay.

07:14.940 --> 07:17.240
You know what's a great place to pick up single moms?

07:17.240 --> 07:19.650
The parking lot of chuck E.Cheese.

07:19.650 --> 07:20.700
You didn'T.

07:20.700 --> 07:21.900
And not just moms.

07:21.900 --> 07:26.690
Nannies,aunts,and a couple of very doable grandmas.

07:28.550 --> 07:30.610
Do you have any shame?

07:30.610 --> 07:32.880
No.Why?

07:36.540 --> 07:38.570
hello?

07:38.850 --> 07:41.090
Hang on.

07:41.870 --> 07:44.070
Who loves kids?

07:44.070 --> 07:45.590
Oh,hey,artie,just got the check.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.950
Thanks.What's up?

07:48.770 --> 07:50.060
Sure,I'll sign some cds.

07:50.060 --> 07:51.800
Where?

07:51.800 --> 07:53.950
They got bookstores just for kids?

07:53.950 --> 07:55.080
Who knew?

07:55.080 --> 07:57.600
Everyone but you.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.720
Okay,I'll be there.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.370
Thanks a lot.

08:00.370 --> 08:01.590
Hey,alan,guess what?

08:01.590 --> 08:02.790
There's no god.

08:02.790 --> 08:08.610
Oh,on the contrary,there is a god and he love me long time.

08:12.280 --> 08:16.180
* Who barfed in the fishbowl,who could it be?*

08:16.180 --> 08:18.020
* Who barfed in the fishbowl?*

08:18.020 --> 08:20.120
* Oh,wait,it's me everybody.*

08:20.120 --> 08:25.760
* Fish food,fish food I made some fish food fish food,fish food,*

08:25.760 --> 08:28.520
* mommy come and see.*

08:34.080 --> 08:37.380
"Love,charlie waffles.

08:37.380 --> 08:38.830
" Here you go,dakota.

08:38.830 --> 08:40.370
What do we say to mr.Waffles?

08:40.370 --> 08:42.049
Thank you,mr.Waffles.

08:42.049 --> 08:43.909
No,thank you,sweetheart.

08:43.909 --> 08:45.300
And thank you,mommy.

08:45.300 --> 08:48.640
So tell me,is there a mrs.Waffles?

08:48.640 --> 08:50.370
Sadly,no.

08:50.370 --> 08:53.500
Well,maybe this will cheer you up.

08:53.690 --> 08:55.810
Come on,honey.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.890
Oh,it do indeed.

08:58.890 --> 09:00.140
The guy's a phenomenon.

09:00.140 --> 09:03.390
The label's already moved a hundred thousand units in less than two weeks.

09:03.390 --> 09:06.980
The wiggles can kiss my pasty,white tushie.

09:07.820 --> 09:09.580
I'm sorry.Who are you?

09:09.580 --> 09:13.450
I'm artie pliskin,president and ceo of fluffy bunny records.

09:13.450 --> 09:14.560
And you are?

09:14.560 --> 09:15.850
Alan,charlie's brother.

09:15.850 --> 09:17.060
Oh,you're the sponge.

09:17.060 --> 09:19.320
Pleasure.

09:20.710 --> 09:22.820
Same here.

09:23.900 --> 09:25.550
Do you believe in god,artie?

09:25.550 --> 09:26.790
I'll tell you what I believe in.

09:26.790 --> 09:31.560
Regular prostate exams,full release massage and charlie freakin' waffles.

09:35.940 --> 09:41.350
Okay,kids,charlie waffles needs to take a little potty break,but he'll be right back.

09:41.350 --> 09:45.040
In the meantime,why don't you all sing along.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.830
here,put this in the mommy and me pile.

09:53.830 --> 09:55.290
I'll be right back.

09:55.290 --> 09:58.140
Alan,this is nothing compared to the concert he's going to give next weekend.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.440
C-concert?

09:59.440 --> 10:00.370
C-concert?

10:00.370 --> 10:05.740
1,200 screaming kids and moms all dying to hear charlie waffles sing in person.

10:05.740 --> 10:07.530
Twelve hundred?

10:07.530 --> 10:09.170
At 50 bucks a pop.

10:09.170 --> 10:11.340
Wait a minute.He's going to make...

10:11.340 --> 10:14.370
$60,000 off one concert?

10:14.370 --> 10:15.210
Yeah.

10:15.210 --> 10:18.060
Good time to be a sponge,huh?

10:19.940 --> 10:21.740
I'm not doing any concerts.

10:21.740 --> 10:22.570
Why not?

10:22.570 --> 10:25.400
'Cause I'm not.Case closed.

10:25.670 --> 10:27.260
What's up with him?

10:27.260 --> 10:31.660
It would appear he's displeased with the latest gold nugget to fall out of his ass.

10:31.660 --> 10:33.120
Yeah,well,trust me.

10:33.120 --> 10:38.740
The gold's gonna keep comin' even if I have to get it myself.

10:46.250 --> 10:48.230
so...

10:48.580 --> 10:51.040
waffle for your thoughts?

10:51.040 --> 10:52.420
Leave me alone.

10:52.420 --> 10:53.440
I don't understand.

10:53.440 --> 10:56.820
I would think a sold-out concert would be good news for charlie waffles.

10:56.820 --> 10:58.560
Yeah,well,it's not.

10:58.560 --> 11:01.120
Because?

11:01.500 --> 11:04.470
You ever wonder why i never played in a band?

11:04.470 --> 11:09.340
I just figured you were already getting laid so much,being in a rock band would seem redundant.

11:09.340 --> 11:11.410
That's not the reason.

11:11.410 --> 11:13.810
Although I did do better than most bass players.

11:13.810 --> 11:16.780
Okay,then what is the reason?

11:17.070 --> 11:18.840
I have stage fright.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.210
You have stage fright?

11:20.210 --> 11:25.060
Severe,debilitating,wet-your-pants stage fright.

11:29.670 --> 11:32.160
I don't understand.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.530
I've seen you perform.

11:34.530 --> 11:37.290
Well,sure,in the living room for a couple of people.

11:37.290 --> 11:42.690
But on a stage with lights,in front of a crowd that's paying to see me?

11:42.690 --> 11:45.940
do you literally pee your pants?

11:46.250 --> 11:47.680
What difference does it make?

11:47.680 --> 11:50.410
I'm just saying your audience is composed of a lot of bed-wetters.

11:50.410 --> 11:54.270
They might get a kick out of seeing you soil yourself.

11:54.270 --> 11:55.380
And you think that would be funny?

11:55.380 --> 11:59.120
Well,I wouldn't,but I'm not your audience.

12:05.020 --> 12:07.410
hello.

12:07.660 --> 12:08.750
I don't know what to tell you,artie.

12:08.750 --> 12:10.420
I can't do it.

12:10.420 --> 12:12.540
I don't need a reason why.

12:12.540 --> 12:14.460
Just tell him the truth.

12:14.460 --> 12:15.590
It's show business,alan.

12:15.590 --> 12:18.740
You don't tell people the truth.

12:19.050 --> 12:20.930
Look,I'll make the cds.

12:20.930 --> 12:21.850
I'll shoot the commercials.

12:21.850 --> 12:23.180
I'll even do the bookstores.

12:23.180 --> 12:26.240
Just no concerts.

12:26.240 --> 12:29.840
Hey,I don't have to do anything.

12:29.840 --> 12:33.260
Oh,yeah,what are you gonna do,sue me?

12:33.260 --> 12:35.740
Really?

12:37.520 --> 12:38.750
Can he sue me?

12:38.750 --> 12:40.410
Did you sign a contract?

12:40.410 --> 12:43.030
What time's the concert?

12:43.930 --> 12:46.060
Okay,see you saturday night.

12:46.060 --> 12:49.060
Wait,wait,wait,11:00 A.M.

12:49.060 --> 12:52.590
Who goes to concerts at 11:00 A.M.

12:52.880 --> 12:55.690
Oh,yeah.

12:55.690 --> 12:58.420
Stupid kids.

13:01.750 --> 13:07.300
A quarter to 1:00 you want to have a little fun you brush your teeth chh,chh,chh,chh...*

13:07.800 --> 13:10.150
what are you watching?

13:10.150 --> 13:11.530
The master at work.

13:11.530 --> 13:17.950
* And you wake up in the morning and it's quarter to 2:00 you want to find something to do you brush your teeth chh,*

13:17.950 --> 13:20.640
* chh,chh,chh,chh,chh you brush your teeth...*

13:20.640 --> 13:24.610
oh,raffi,you magnificent son of a bitch.

13:25.870 --> 13:27.250
How do you do it?

13:27.250 --> 13:28.740
How does he do it,alan?

13:28.740 --> 13:30.670
What's he got that I don't?

13:30.670 --> 13:37.230
Well,based on first impressions,I'd say a genuine love of children and bladder control.

13:37.570 --> 13:38.990
Oh,that was just a cheap shot.

13:38.990 --> 13:41.150
I take 'em when I get 'em.

13:42.450 --> 13:46.440
Look at him,all relaxed and smiling.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.830
Last time I was in front of an audience like that,

13:48.830 --> 13:50.620
it was the seventh grade talent show.

13:50.620 --> 13:52.640
I started shaking,sweating.

13:52.640 --> 13:53.980
I felt like I wanted to throw up.

13:53.980 --> 13:56.690
Don't forget peeing in your pants.

13:58.430 --> 14:01.280
You keep pitching me fat ones.

14:02.480 --> 14:03.680
I'm not talking to you anymore.

14:03.680 --> 14:07.770
Oh come on,look,if you knew in seventh grade that you couldn't perform,

14:07.770 --> 14:09.940
why'd you become a musician?

14:09.940 --> 14:13.160
Because there's one thing I'm more afraid of than an audience.

14:13.160 --> 14:13.790
What's that?

14:13.790 --> 14:16.050
An honest day's work?

14:16.500 --> 14:20.080
If you knew the answer,why'd you ask the question?

14:23.550 --> 14:26.380
Charlie waffles!

14:26.380 --> 14:28.160
Where the hell is he,alan?

14:28.160 --> 14:31.000
I don't know.He said he wanted to take a walk to calm himself down.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.450
I promise you,I will crucify that son of a bitch.

14:33.450 --> 14:37.970
The two of you are going to be living in box over a heating vent when I get through suing him.

14:38.420 --> 14:41.730
Could it be a box with a guest room?

14:42.050 --> 14:43.780
Charlie: Hey,alan...

14:43.780 --> 14:46.090
I figured out what went wrong in seventh grade.

14:46.090 --> 14:47.530
What?

14:47.530 --> 14:51.490
I hadn't started drinking yet.

14:51.910 --> 14:53.970
Charlie,you have to get out there.

14:53.970 --> 14:55.910
You're right.

14:55.910 --> 14:59.540
The little bastards await.

15:01.190 --> 15:04.900
You can't sue him if he just stinks,right?

15:11.220 --> 15:12.820
who loves kids?

15:12.820 --> 15:15.680
Charlie waffles!

15:15.680 --> 15:17.950
You're damn right!

16:14.390 --> 16:16.450
How can they love him?

16:16.450 --> 16:17.510
Who cares?

16:17.510 --> 16:19.620
We're gonna make a fortune.

16:19.620 --> 16:21.780
Doesn't it bother you that he's loaded?

16:21.780 --> 16:23.310
He's a musician.

16:23.310 --> 16:25.470
It'd bother me if he wasn'T.

16:25.470 --> 16:40.470
* Bye-bye,boobies,bye-bye,boobies bye-bye,boobies 'cause I'm a big kid now.*

17:21.349 --> 17:23.670
I couldn't sleep.

17:24.900 --> 17:25.960
Something bothering you?

17:25.960 --> 17:27.520
It's nothing.

17:27.520 --> 17:28.670
Oh,come on.
