00:20.806 --> 00:24.350
[eclectic orchestral theme plays]

02:05.785 --> 02:10.082
[Abraham, voice echoing] Whenever I have
a difficult decision to make, I come here.

02:10.165 --> 02:13.376
This place brings a clarity
to any decision.

03:43.675 --> 03:47.679
"Is the Holocaust an aberration
or a reflection of who we really are?"

03:47.762 --> 03:49.973
[children laughing,
chattering in distance]

03:50.056 --> 03:51.850
Why is it so loud where you are?

03:54.060 --> 03:55.561
It's Independence Day.

03:55.645 --> 03:57.105
[chuckles]

03:57.189 --> 03:58.898
What is best in life, huh?

04:00.108 --> 04:01.693
I don't understand.

04:01.776 --> 04:03.903
No, you wouldn't.

04:21.462 --> 04:24.216
[laughter, indistinct chattering]

04:41.691 --> 04:43.068
[Jonas] You look lost.

04:44.361 --> 04:45.653
Why'd you do that?

04:45.737 --> 04:48.198
- Do what?
- Leave.

04:48.281 --> 04:50.491
I told you it was
not a mobile service, Will.

04:50.575 --> 04:52.827
Connections are fragile things.

04:52.911 --> 04:55.455
[monitor beeps steadily]

04:55.538 --> 04:57.416
It doesn't take them long to respond.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.584
Maybe you should find us
somewhere to talk.

05:04.839 --> 05:06.299
[door opens]

05:29.530 --> 05:31.616
It is extraordinary.

05:31.699 --> 05:36.746
I have never experienced anything like it,
not in my 20 years since passing the bar.

05:37.497 --> 05:40.959
Your father did everything
he said he was going to do, and more...

05:41.793 --> 05:44.504
the court agreed to hear his testimony.

05:45.171 --> 05:50.218
If the hearing goes well, I think I can
have you out of here in less than a week.

05:56.349 --> 05:58.768
You have to agree to the procedure here.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.824
What will happen to Joong-Ki?

06:15.285 --> 06:16.577
[lawyer sighs]

06:16.661 --> 06:20.373
The court was lenient on you
because you cooperated.

06:21.707 --> 06:25.504
I suspect...
they will make an example of him.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.588
If I were your brother...

06:28.881 --> 06:31.884
I would be on the next plane
to somewhere far from Seoul.

07:08.796 --> 07:11.966
I want to believe
that the past is done with us

07:12.050 --> 07:14.760
the moment we are done with it.

07:35.698 --> 07:38.493
[Steiner] What's up, Wolfman? Ooh...

07:38.577 --> 07:42.663
- The fuck are you doing here?
- Down, boy. Down. [tsking]

07:42.747 --> 07:45.958
I heard dear Dad came to see you.

07:46.042 --> 07:49.462
He said you had yourselves
a real nice... man-to-man,

07:49.546 --> 07:52.465
but, knowing you, cousin, like I do,

07:52.549 --> 07:58.597
I figured you needed a little...
motivational... TED-type talk?

08:01.182 --> 08:02.475
Now, first of all...

08:05.353 --> 08:06.979
I love Felix.

08:08.814 --> 08:12.402
It was really hard...
to watch what happened to him.

08:13.945 --> 08:17.198
Even though I know
that he would agree when I say

08:17.282 --> 08:19.825
that he did bring it upon himself.

08:21.160 --> 08:26.040
But... I am pulling
for his total recovery.

08:26.124 --> 08:30.462
In fact, I have some...
close friends that work here,

08:30.545 --> 08:33.923
and I asked them
to keep an eye on him for me.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.676
[chuckles] They did scare me a little

08:36.759 --> 08:39.345
with all the talk
about the things that can go wrong

08:39.429 --> 08:42.014
when someone like Felix
is trying to recover.

08:42.098 --> 08:44.601
Like, they had one case recently

08:44.684 --> 08:49.355
where someone got the wrong medicine,
and boom! [whispers] Dead.

08:50.148 --> 08:56.321
Would be some kinda... bad luck
for old Felixer, after surviving all this.

08:56.404 --> 08:58.906
Can we just fast-forward
to the end of this shit?

08:58.990 --> 09:01.826
- You get the diamonds--
- [shouts] My diamonds!

09:01.909 --> 09:04.496
And you give Felix and me a pass.

09:06.331 --> 09:08.166
Well...

09:08.249 --> 09:10.751
I'm a forward-looking person, Wolfie.

09:10.835 --> 09:12.504
You gotta believe that.

09:12.587 --> 09:14.547
I don't dwell on the past.

09:15.465 --> 09:20.720
I get my rocks back,
and we all live happily ever after.

09:24.349 --> 09:27.602
- It's Independence Day?
- Yeah.

09:28.353 --> 09:29.604
My parents were from India.

09:29.688 --> 09:32.440
I was born there, but they moved to London
when I was a baby.

09:32.524 --> 09:35.109
In my 20s, I moved to New York.

09:36.569 --> 09:39.739
I never fully grasped
where I owed my allegiance.

09:40.906 --> 09:42.825
Didn't know what I was supposed to sing.

09:42.908 --> 09:46.829
The Indian national anthem? America's?

09:46.912 --> 09:48.456
"God Save the Queen"?

09:51.083 --> 09:54.546
I envy people their clear-cut allegiances.

09:55.505 --> 09:57.716
Yeah, my dad's like that.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.552
One beer, he's hammering the world
into two different sides,

10:00.635 --> 10:02.887
Bears or Packers, us or them.

10:04.681 --> 10:06.599
He's more right than he knows.

10:06.683 --> 10:11.020
When you said that we're not like them,
did you mean we're not human?

10:11.103 --> 10:12.522
What is human?

10:13.523 --> 10:18.110
An ability to reason? To imagine?
To love or grieve?

10:20.154 --> 10:23.616
If so, we are more human
than any human ever will be.

10:29.581 --> 10:30.749
What troubles you?

10:35.878 --> 10:36.879
It's all right.

10:38.506 --> 10:40.049
Say what's on your mind.

10:45.304 --> 10:47.766
For some time now...

10:49.975 --> 10:54.647
I've been... confused about the wedding.

10:56.315 --> 10:57.609
I know.

11:01.070 --> 11:05.575
The police wanted to know
why Papa-ji was at the temple.

11:08.369 --> 11:12.248
Since he's a non-believer,
I assume to see you.

11:12.331 --> 11:14.208
Did he tell you why?

11:16.335 --> 11:20.089
Manendra said that...
he was reconsidering our marriage.

11:21.299 --> 11:24.343
Ah... I see.

11:26.137 --> 11:28.389
So did you tell the police?

11:28.473 --> 11:29.724
No.

11:30.891 --> 11:34.979
- Why not?
- Because I haven't told Rajan.

11:37.440 --> 11:40.819
Because you are
still confused about the wedding.

11:42.194 --> 11:44.530
More confused than ever.

11:45.490 --> 11:48.951
Well, you have to wonder,
if Manendra changed his mind,

11:49.034 --> 11:51.370
why did he come to you
instead of his own son?

11:53.122 --> 11:57.126
Perhaps because he knew
his own son wouldn't listen to him.

11:57.209 --> 11:59.170
This was a love marriage, after all.

11:59.253 --> 12:02.548
But it's possible that Rajan
will now have a different reaction

12:02.632 --> 12:06.969
if it turns out that
this is his father's very last wish.

12:07.052 --> 12:12.266
By telling Rajan now,
you will actually empower his father,

12:12.350 --> 12:18.397
giving him more control over Rajan's life
than he had while he was alive.

12:21.066 --> 12:23.152
[sighs] Interesting.

12:26.739 --> 12:29.868
The simple solution
would be to tell the truth...

12:30.743 --> 12:33.329
and let the chips fall where they may.

12:33.412 --> 12:36.666
But if this marriage
holds the possible future

12:36.749 --> 12:38.877
of a long and happy life together,

12:38.959 --> 12:42.963
is it right to let a dominating man
take that away from you?

12:43.047 --> 12:48.845
And yet, to not tell Rajan is to build...
whatever happiness you might find

12:48.928 --> 12:50.763
upon a secret.

12:54.392 --> 12:55.727
[sighs softly]

12:55.810 --> 12:58.229
Not an easy decision, to be sure...

12:59.355 --> 13:03.442
but one that I know
you already have the answer for.

13:14.370 --> 13:17.623
Years ago... I was on your side
of this conversation,

13:17.707 --> 13:21.085
and the man in my place
was the father of our cluster.

13:21.168 --> 13:24.463
He was telling me all sorts of bullshit
about the psycellium,

13:24.547 --> 13:26.591
about how he could feel
from this present moment

13:26.674 --> 13:30.135
all the way back to the first breath
his cluster ever took.

13:30.219 --> 13:32.680
He was telling me
what it meant to be sensate.

13:32.764 --> 13:35.683
But I-- I don't understand
how they never found me out.

13:35.767 --> 13:37.936
I've had x-rays, MRIs, blood tests...

13:39.562 --> 13:41.522
The differences are very subtle.

13:42.481 --> 13:46.444
Understand, we are closer to humankind
than the bonobo is to a baboon.

13:47.069 --> 13:50.865
You've gotta know what you're looking for.
Evolution is frugal in her variation.

13:50.949 --> 13:55.661
One small chromosome here or there
and you walk on two legs instead of four.

13:56.913 --> 14:00.207
But I look the same.
I feel the same.

14:01.793 --> 14:03.962
- Really?
- In most ways.

14:05.004 --> 14:07.214
You mean when you're not
sharing your most private thoughts

14:07.298 --> 14:09.634
with someone
on the other side of the world?

14:15.431 --> 14:17.308
[no audio from TV]

14:32.991 --> 14:34.700
You're Capheus.

14:39.831 --> 14:41.165
I'm Kala.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.418
You are beautiful.

14:45.461 --> 14:46.587
Thank you.

14:47.880 --> 14:50.591
- Do you mind if I...?
- Please, sit.

14:56.722 --> 15:01.019
- That is a very large television.
- Ah, yes. [chuckles]

15:01.101 --> 15:05.439
Samsung SMT-4023, 42 inches.

15:05.523 --> 15:08.693
Best value, color space, and resolution.

15:08.776 --> 15:10.069
[chuckles]

15:12.321 --> 15:15.574
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course.

15:15.658 --> 15:19.453
The first time I went
into a house like this in Bombay...

15:19.537 --> 15:24.042
they had no beds,
but they had a television as big as this.

15:24.124 --> 15:28.880
I mean, how can a TV
be more important than a bed?

15:28.963 --> 15:31.507
Ah... That's simple.

15:31.590 --> 15:33.968
The bed keeps you in a slum.

15:34.052 --> 15:36.303
The flat screen takes you out.

15:37.429 --> 15:38.931
- Ah...
- Eh.

15:39.015 --> 15:41.141
- [Kala chuckles]
- [no audio from TV]

15:43.352 --> 15:45.646
- What are you watching?
- Lionheart.

15:46.522 --> 15:48.232
- Never heard of it.
- Really?

15:48.315 --> 15:49.400
- [Kala chuckles]
- Ah!

15:49.483 --> 15:51.485
Does it have any dancing in it?

15:51.569 --> 15:55.489
Jean-Claude is the Fred Astaire...
of martial arts.

15:55.573 --> 15:58.409
Ah... I love Fred Astaire.

15:58.492 --> 16:01.871
Lionheart is the first movie that
made me fall in love with Jean-Claude.

16:02.705 --> 16:05.624
I watch it any time
I need to find courage.

16:08.377 --> 16:10.337
I could use some courage right now.

16:20.556 --> 16:21.974
[microwave beeps]

16:52.421 --> 16:54.214
- [crowd clapping on TV]
- [Kala groans]

16:54.298 --> 16:57.176
- [man] Lionheart!
- [fighter grunting]

16:57.259 --> 16:58.177
[Kala groans]

16:58.803 --> 17:00.930
I thought you said
this film had dancing in it.

17:01.013 --> 17:02.514
This is dancing.

17:02.598 --> 17:04.683
It's so violent.

17:04.767 --> 17:06.185
Life is violent.

17:10.064 --> 17:11.273
It is.

17:12.608 --> 17:14.234
I didn't think so before.

17:16.028 --> 17:17.237
But you do now.

17:23.119 --> 17:26.747
[Jonas] Watch a flock of birds
or a shoal of fish move as one...

17:26.831 --> 17:28.791
and you glimpse where we came from.

17:29.792 --> 17:33.087
Ask how aspen trees feel trauma
hundreds of miles apart,

17:33.171 --> 17:36.423
or how a mushroom
can understand the needs of a forest...

17:37.382 --> 17:39.760
you'd begin to grasp what we are.

17:39.844 --> 17:42.554
Our kind has been here
since the beginning.

17:43.806 --> 17:46.517
In all likelihood, we were the beginning.

17:48.352 --> 17:52.397
What I want... is to make sure
we're there at the end.

17:52.481 --> 17:55.943
But if there's another species
of Homo sapien, how can it be a secret?

17:56.027 --> 17:58.570
Secrets are important to their species.

17:58.654 --> 18:01.782
Secrets are the center
of their identities, of their societies.

18:01.866 --> 18:04.202
Secrets maintain their hierarchies.

18:04.284 --> 18:08.789
To reveal this secret,
that there is another kind of human,

18:08.873 --> 18:12.918
one whose existence threatens
the very fundament of their reality...

18:14.503 --> 18:17.631
No... they'll never allow that.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.386
Do you have a secret, Jonas?

18:25.472 --> 18:27.307
You're a good cop, aren't you?

18:29.977 --> 18:33.147
They're gonna try to use me to get to you
and the rest of your cluster.

18:33.231 --> 18:34.690
The one who came for Nomi, Dr. Matheson?

18:36.483 --> 18:38.069
He uses many names.

18:38.152 --> 18:41.363
- [man whispers] Jonas...
- Angelica called him Whispers.

18:42.531 --> 18:44.242
Never look him in the eye.

18:45.450 --> 18:46.660
Never.

18:49.371 --> 18:50.998
Angelica.

18:51.874 --> 18:53.667
That's why she killed herself.

18:54.668 --> 18:56.045
To protect us.

19:22.238 --> 19:24.364
My father told me something
that always stayed with me.

19:24.448 --> 19:26.533
It's probably what kept me alive.

19:26.617 --> 19:28.619
He said that what made us "us"

19:28.702 --> 19:31.622
was far less important
than what makes them "them."

19:32.290 --> 19:34.499
In the end,
it doesn't matter who came first.

19:34.583 --> 19:38.254
All that matters is the fact
that one small chromosomal mutation

19:38.337 --> 19:41.757
severed them from their connection
to nature, and to each other.

19:41.840 --> 19:45.761
That isolation has allowed them
to focus on the one thing they do better

19:45.844 --> 19:48.388
than any species in history.

19:50.266 --> 19:54.519
Killing is easy...
when you can feel nothing.

20:17.501 --> 20:19.295
- Search him.
- I just did.

20:21.255 --> 20:22.631
Search him again!

20:22.714 --> 20:25.801
He's a fucking smart guy,
aren't you, Wolfie?

20:26.802 --> 20:29.721
He knows all the tricks, so fucking smart.

20:34.434 --> 20:35.560
Just found that.

20:35.644 --> 20:38.356
Open it. Could be wired.

20:41.942 --> 20:42.901
Open it!

20:47.906 --> 20:49.700
[exhales softly]

20:49.783 --> 20:51.910
[softly] Yeah! [laughs]

20:54.538 --> 20:56.332
[whistles]

20:58.542 --> 21:03.714
So fucking smart. You think Felix
would think you're so fucking smart now?

21:05.299 --> 21:06.675
You got what you wanted.

21:07.551 --> 21:10.888
I wanna know something.
How did you do it?

21:11.889 --> 21:14.225
When I walked in, the safe was clean.

21:14.308 --> 21:16.394
I spent two hours cutting it open.

21:17.269 --> 21:19.938
Tell me... how you did it.

21:21.815 --> 21:23.025
I cracked it.

21:24.902 --> 21:25.986
You cracked it?

21:26.778 --> 21:29.156
Like... in the movies?

21:29.990 --> 21:32.659
Listening to the tumblers
with your stethoscope?

21:32.743 --> 21:34.161
You just cracked it?!

21:39.417 --> 21:41.919
Fucking smart guy, right here!

21:42.002 --> 21:45.923
First guy in history
to fuck the pants off an S&D safe.

21:46.006 --> 21:47.174
Huh?

21:47.758 --> 21:48.675
[grunts]

21:50.135 --> 21:52.888
Is that really
what you expect me to believe?

21:52.971 --> 21:54.432
You think I'm that fucking stupid?

21:54.473 --> 21:56.641
- Huh?!
- [grunts]

22:00.396 --> 22:03.648
Oh. Is that what you think?

22:05.234 --> 22:07.027
You think I'm stupid, huh?

22:07.778 --> 22:10.781
Hey, Wolfie, where you going?

22:10.864 --> 22:12.866
You haven't answered my question yet.

22:14.826 --> 22:16.495
Answer my fucking question.

22:18.789 --> 22:22.251
You think I'm stupid?
That what you think? Huh?!

22:22.334 --> 22:24.836
[exhales] No.

22:24.920 --> 22:28.048
Well, OK.

22:28.132 --> 22:30.259
First smart thing you said.

22:30.342 --> 22:35.139
Now... tell me the fucking truth
or I'll blow your smart-guy brains

22:35.222 --> 22:36.390
all over the fucking street!

23:25.689 --> 23:27.024
You knew everything.

23:28.108 --> 23:32.154
You knew he would hit you,
you knew you would fall to the ground.

23:32.237 --> 23:35.991
But he kicked you and drove you
away from the gun. You were really close.

23:38.494 --> 23:40.787
All I needed was a little space.

23:42.122 --> 23:45.792
Why don't you just...
tell him something he wants to hear?

23:45.876 --> 23:47.627
Tell him... Tell him...

23:47.711 --> 23:50.881
I don't know, just a little lie
that will make him relax and then we--

23:50.964 --> 23:52.174
we'll figure it out.

23:52.257 --> 23:53.342
I can't.

23:54.510 --> 23:55.511
Why?

23:55.594 --> 23:58.180
He reminds me of my father.

23:58.263 --> 24:00.140
Just a little lie.

24:04.436 --> 24:06.564
OK. May I?

24:07.481 --> 24:08.648
Do you mind?

24:14.321 --> 24:15.531
[Steiner] Did you hear me?!

24:16.448 --> 24:19.701
Tell me the fucking truth. [panting]

24:19.784 --> 24:20.785
[screams] Tell me!

24:21.620 --> 24:22.662
[Steiner grunts]

24:31.838 --> 24:35.467
It was Felix. It was Felix.

24:36.176 --> 24:39.888
He found out... the Indian liked boys.

24:41.765 --> 24:44.602
Ran into him at a club,
fed him some drinks.

24:45.561 --> 24:48.772
- [Steiner giggling]
- Felix got the combination from him.

24:48.855 --> 24:52.526
I knew it! I fucking knew it!

24:52.610 --> 24:54.528
Fucking Felix!

24:54.612 --> 24:58.156
[chuckles] I bet he sucked his cock!

24:58.240 --> 25:00.325
There had to be
some cock-sucking involved.

25:00.409 --> 25:02.077
He sucked his cock, didn't he?

25:03.078 --> 25:04.871
[sighs]

25:04.955 --> 25:06.415
He did what he had to do.

25:06.498 --> 25:09.876
Ooh! Cock-sucking Felix!

25:09.960 --> 25:11.711
[laughing]

25:12.379 --> 25:14.465
Look! Look at this.

25:14.548 --> 25:16.508
Would any of you suck cock for this?

25:17.759 --> 25:18.843
Sure.

25:21.930 --> 25:27.185
That's why you and cock-sucking Felix
and Wolfie are all fucking idiots,

25:27.269 --> 25:29.896
and I'm the only one
with some fucking brains here!

25:36.945 --> 25:37.862
What?!

25:42.493 --> 25:44.578
[machine gun fire]

25:46.871 --> 25:48.915
[machine gun fire]

25:57.466 --> 25:58.717
You're fucking dead!

25:58.800 --> 26:01.136
You and your cock-sucking friend
are fucking dead!

26:09.894 --> 26:11.355
What the fuck?!

26:14.316 --> 26:16.610
Fuck!

26:23.701 --> 26:25.827
[fire crackling]

26:38.298 --> 26:39.591
Fucking hell!

26:39.675 --> 26:41.510
That's what I'm talking about!

26:43.261 --> 26:44.846
Fucking hell, man.

26:45.972 --> 26:47.224
What the fuck is that?

26:50.810 --> 26:51.645
Thank you.

26:54.773 --> 26:56.483
Lying is easy.

26:56.567 --> 26:58.026
It's what I do.

27:01.071 --> 27:04.199
Sometimes... you make a mistake.

27:04.282 --> 27:06.493
You've got two choices:

27:06.577 --> 27:09.120
you live with it, or you fix it.

27:26.388 --> 27:28.223
[panting]

27:29.849 --> 27:31.643
[line ringing]

27:31.727 --> 27:34.896
[recording plays] Hello, this is Hernando.
Now you say something.

27:34.979 --> 27:36.022
[machine beeps]

27:36.106 --> 27:38.734
Hernando, you might
never get this message.

27:38.817 --> 27:40.402
Your mailbox is full.

27:41.361 --> 27:43.572
You should really-- It doesn't matter.

27:47.033 --> 27:49.035
I made a terrible mistake, my love...

27:50.161 --> 27:53.582
but I swear to you...
that I'm gonna fix it.

28:21.109 --> 28:22.277
[Will] Hi.

28:23.069 --> 28:24.070
Hi.

28:28.241 --> 28:29.660
You all right?

28:32.370 --> 28:34.122
I'm here to see my father.

28:34.205 --> 28:36.667
- He's playing tonight?
- Mm-hm.

28:36.750 --> 28:38.335
That's cool. It's gonna be great.

28:40.253 --> 28:41.505
I'm actually seeing my dad, too.

28:46.468 --> 28:48.345
[whispers] What is it?

28:50.305 --> 28:51.807
I saw Jonas.

28:51.890 --> 28:55.268
He said that it was dangerous
for you to be in Iceland.

28:57.270 --> 28:59.105
Yrsa said the same thing.

28:59.189 --> 29:00.816
Will you please be careful?

29:04.778 --> 29:06.780
Yrsa said something else, too.

29:08.657 --> 29:14.245
She said that Jonas can't be trusted...
that he worked with BPO.

29:14.329 --> 29:16.956
[sighs] Mm...

29:18.041 --> 29:19.250
I don't know what's true or not.

29:19.334 --> 29:22.128
I just think we have to...
watch out for each other.

29:27.759 --> 29:29.427
I was just thinking...

29:32.138 --> 29:36.184
I was thinking that...
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.147
There was a time when...

29:41.231 --> 29:46.027
that wouldn't have meant anything to me,
but... now it does.

29:50.908 --> 29:52.242
Thank you.

30:03.670 --> 30:05.714
[chuckles]

30:31.197 --> 30:34.618
Oh, my God. If this feels that good
when we're not really here,

30:34.701 --> 30:36.745
what's it gonna be like when we are?

30:57.849 --> 30:59.810
You came back.

30:59.893 --> 31:02.061
Yes... I did.

31:03.647 --> 31:04.648
Can I get you something?

31:06.190 --> 31:07.567
Double tequila.

31:27.504 --> 31:28.338
Another?

31:29.673 --> 31:31.591
You ask me if I want another?

31:32.383 --> 31:34.177
Then I want two.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.637
Two double tequilas.

31:36.304 --> 31:37.848
Tequila squared.

31:39.432 --> 31:42.393
- Four?
- Four. Yes.

31:45.438 --> 31:46.815
[adds two glasses]

31:46.898 --> 31:48.232
[unscrews bottle]

31:57.617 --> 32:01.788
Listen, if I offended you before...
I'm sorry.

32:03.957 --> 32:05.625
Do not apologize.

32:08.252 --> 32:10.129
- [sets glass down heavily]
- [pants]

32:10.213 --> 32:11.673
The mistake was mine.

32:18.763 --> 32:20.390
- [sets glass down]
- [sighs]

32:21.725 --> 32:23.184
[softly] I should've told you the truth.

32:39.158 --> 32:40.952
This is a stolen kiss...

32:43.038 --> 32:45.623
because these lips belong to another.

32:46.624 --> 32:49.878
And even though
you're a very attractive man...

32:49.961 --> 32:52.505
and your offer
to do terrible things to me was...

32:54.883 --> 32:56.051
was effective...

32:57.886 --> 32:59.846
I should've told you, "No, thank you"...

33:01.180 --> 33:03.850
because I have
already met the love of my life...

33:06.937 --> 33:08.479
and his name is Hernando.

33:15.319 --> 33:16.613
[sighs]

33:18.656 --> 33:19.741
[exhales sharply]

33:21.367 --> 33:22.535
[doors close]

33:27.206 --> 33:30.376
- Riley! Hey! Hey!
- Riles!

33:30.460 --> 33:32.295
[chuckles]
They told me you were out here.

33:32.378 --> 33:33.546
- [man] Hey.
- [Riley] Hey.

33:33.630 --> 33:36.549
Oh, just getting
the creative juices flowing.

33:36.633 --> 33:38.301
That's pretty cute.

33:38.384 --> 33:39.761
Cute?

33:39.844 --> 33:42.889
Getting stoned in your tuxes
like it's 1985.

33:42.973 --> 33:46.017
- For some of us, it is 1985.
- [Riley laughs]

33:46.101 --> 33:48.436
I don't mean it badly.

33:48.519 --> 33:50.730
It's what we were
talking about today, Papa.

33:50.814 --> 33:53.483
It's not much different in London,
but we don't use pot.

33:53.566 --> 33:55.777
Oh, no?
What do you use then?

33:57.445 --> 33:59.447
Usually start with one of these.

33:59.530 --> 34:01.365
[Gunnar] Oh, wow. What's that?

34:01.449 --> 34:02.533
Ecstasy.

34:06.663 --> 34:07.622
Yeah.

34:09.666 --> 34:11.168
All right.

34:21.011 --> 34:22.637
Oh, you got the brats!

34:23.680 --> 34:25.306
Yeah, I got the brats.

34:27.642 --> 34:31.146
- From Gene's?
- Yeah, Dad, from Gene's.

34:31.729 --> 34:33.606
Come here. Gimme a kiss.

34:37.110 --> 34:39.112
[inaudible dialogue]

34:43.574 --> 34:45.660
[tires squealing]

35:49.766 --> 35:51.142
What do you want, faggot?

35:51.226 --> 35:52.518
I've come for my friend.

35:53.352 --> 35:55.021
Come on, Dani.

35:55.105 --> 35:56.981
Are you sure, Lito?

35:58.733 --> 36:00.151
You're coming home.

36:02.737 --> 36:05.949
Where are you going, Dani? Hm?

36:06.032 --> 36:08.201
I'm going with Lito, obviously.

36:09.077 --> 36:11.412
This is fucking bullshit.

36:11.495 --> 36:14.415
- She's not going anywhere with you.
- It's over, Joaquin.

36:15.125 --> 36:16.375
[chuckles softly]

36:18.002 --> 36:22.340
Listen, you're forgetting
one little thing, faggot.

36:22.423 --> 36:24.134
I still have the pictures.

36:25.051 --> 36:29.139
If she gets in that car...
it's bye-bye career.

36:30.640 --> 36:33.684
[sighs]
Do what you want with the pictures.

36:36.146 --> 36:37.605
I don't care.

36:40.483 --> 36:41.901
Let's go home.

36:43.069 --> 36:43.903
Aah!

36:45.155 --> 36:46.489
I don't want to hurt you, Joaquin.

36:46.572 --> 36:48.283
[Daniela whimpers]

36:48.366 --> 36:49.659
All right.

36:50.952 --> 36:52.996
We can do this easy... or we can do this--

36:53.079 --> 36:54.998
- [Joaquin yells]
- [gasps]

36:55.081 --> 36:57.834
[Lito groans]

36:57.917 --> 36:59.418
[Joaquin screams]

36:59.502 --> 37:00.878
[groaning]

37:06.092 --> 37:07.302
[grunting]

37:07.385 --> 37:10.972
- [Joaquin shouts]
- Not in the face! No, no!

37:11.055 --> 37:13.183
[Lito] Not in the face! [groans]

37:13.266 --> 37:14.433
Not in the face.

37:14.517 --> 37:15.393
Aw!

37:16.686 --> 37:18.229
Yes! Yes!

37:19.689 --> 37:21.565
You like that? Huh?!

37:23.193 --> 37:26.487
- You want more? You want more?
- Come on.

37:26.570 --> 37:27.822
That's all you got? Come on!

37:29.073 --> 37:30.867
- [Joaquin growls]
- [Lito grunts]

37:32.869 --> 37:33.744
[groans]

37:36.497 --> 37:39.250
Joaquin, Joaquin, no. No, no, no!

37:39.334 --> 37:41.169
- Joaquin! Ahh!
- [Joaquin grunts]

37:41.252 --> 37:42.628
[Lito shrieks]

37:44.339 --> 37:46.257
- [yells]
- [pot shatters]

37:46.966 --> 37:49.177
Now you sell flowers, pussy? Huh?

37:49.260 --> 37:52.096
- Come on, come on!
- [grunts]

37:52.180 --> 37:53.223
[groans]

37:57.018 --> 37:58.311
[both grunting]

38:01.731 --> 38:04.692
[Joaquin panting]

38:08.654 --> 38:11.615
[voice distant]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

38:11.699 --> 38:12.825
[shrieks]

38:20.083 --> 38:21.167
Get up.

38:38.435 --> 38:39.518
Joaquin!

38:41.771 --> 38:43.147
We're not done.

38:45.024 --> 38:46.317
[Daniela whimpers]

38:52.949 --> 38:54.617
[laughing]

38:59.163 --> 39:00.498
[yells]

39:02.292 --> 39:04.210
You call that a punch?

39:04.294 --> 39:05.378
[grunts]

39:05.462 --> 39:08.756
Come on, you can do better, huh?
I'm right here.

39:10.883 --> 39:13.636
Are we done? Huh? I think we're done.

39:13.719 --> 39:14.637
[grunts]

39:14.720 --> 39:16.389
- Fucker!
- [groans]

39:18.641 --> 39:19.934
[body thuds]

39:29.944 --> 39:33.114
[panting]

39:33.197 --> 39:34.282
Thank you.

39:36.242 --> 39:37.535
Fighting is easy.

39:38.369 --> 39:40.121
Fighting is what I do.

39:48.921 --> 39:50.507
Let's go home, Dani.

39:56.179 --> 40:01.392
It's a perfect night.
I love the Fourth of July.

40:01.476 --> 40:04.395
It's my... It's my favorite holiday.

40:04.479 --> 40:06.897
I mean, I'm here with my kid.

40:06.981 --> 40:09.192
Pretty soon, they're gonna blow up shit.

40:11.652 --> 40:13.696
Doesn't get better than this.

40:17.867 --> 40:22.913
You know, when I was a kid, I thought...
I thought I couldn't be a cop.

40:24.541 --> 40:26.750
My dad was an electrician.

40:27.793 --> 40:30.380
He got out of the war, joined the union.

40:30.463 --> 40:34.425
I thought... "When I grow up,
I'm gonna be an electrician."

40:34.509 --> 40:40.139
The summer I turned 15, my old man
takes me down to the union hall.

40:40.223 --> 40:42.433
He's so proud.

40:42.517 --> 40:46.521
I get my card... but I hated the job.

40:46.604 --> 40:48.647
Hated the job.

40:50.400 --> 40:54.778
I kept shocking myself,
and his friends are all laughin' at me.

40:58.616 --> 41:00.659
I quit that summer.

41:01.411 --> 41:02.995
He was...

41:03.079 --> 41:08.376
He was furious, like,
"What are you gonna do with your life?"

41:09.586 --> 41:12.630
I told him, "I'm gonna be a cop."

41:14.673 --> 41:16.717
The way he looked at me...

41:17.594 --> 41:19.929
[sighs] I'll never forget it.

41:21.972 --> 41:24.975
Like he didn't know who I was.

41:28.396 --> 41:30.106
I'll tell you something, though.

41:30.189 --> 41:32.483
The day you told me
you wanted to be a cop...

41:33.443 --> 41:35.612
proudest damn day of my life.

41:39.490 --> 41:41.158
[indistinct chatter]

41:53.045 --> 41:54.380
[laughs]

41:54.464 --> 41:58.134
- [pop music playing]
- [fireworks booming]

42:02.846 --> 42:03.764
Whoo!

42:05.683 --> 42:06.976
Cheers!

42:14.484 --> 42:15.818
[moaning]

42:27.830 --> 42:28.831
Yeah!

42:48.976 --> 42:52.730
- [fireworks crackling]
- [Will and his father cheer]

43:07.537 --> 43:08.663
[groans]

43:11.165 --> 43:12.082
Aah!

43:16.337 --> 43:17.714
Oh, God!

43:25.179 --> 43:27.264
[panting] Oh, my...

43:27.348 --> 43:32.019
Now that... is what I call fireworks.

43:32.853 --> 43:34.480
[both laugh]

43:35.939 --> 43:37.941
[fireworks crackling]

43:38.025 --> 43:39.360
Whoo!

43:41.028 --> 43:43.280
I love fireworks.

43:43.364 --> 43:45.157
Me, too.

43:45.241 --> 43:47.702
Me, three. [laughs]

43:49.161 --> 43:50.329
[Capheus] Whoo!

43:52.456 --> 43:55.626
- Whoo!
- [fireworks crackling rapidly]

44:06.011 --> 44:07.137
[doorbell rings]

44:14.978 --> 44:16.355
What happened to you?

44:17.523 --> 44:20.735
- I got in a fight.
- What?

44:20.818 --> 44:22.361
A fight?

44:22.445 --> 44:25.531
Are you stupid? Look at your face.
You won't be able to shoot tomorrow.

44:27.533 --> 44:29.368
You do still love me.

44:32.580 --> 44:36.542
[grunts softly] Well, I know
how important your career is to you.

44:43.006 --> 44:44.341
Can I come in?

44:46.761 --> 44:48.095
Please?

44:57.563 --> 44:59.356
[Hernando sighs]

45:03.402 --> 45:05.070
You were right, Hernando.

45:06.864 --> 45:08.324
I was a coward.

45:10.660 --> 45:15.456
I cared too much about things that...
aren't important.

45:16.248 --> 45:20.919
I took for granted all the things
you gave up in life to... be with me.

45:22.212 --> 45:25.675
Many of these things became clear
because of Daniela.

45:25.758 --> 45:28.218
I understand why
you reacted the way you did.

45:34.266 --> 45:36.268
I made a terrible mistake.

45:41.732 --> 45:43.233
But I fixed it.

45:44.527 --> 45:45.820
[approaching footsteps]

45:48.989 --> 45:51.450
- Dani?
- [laughs]

45:54.578 --> 45:57.414
- [Daniela] Ay...
- [Hernando sighs]

45:59.958 --> 46:01.502
I-- I don't understand.

46:01.585 --> 46:03.295
Lito saved me! He saved me.

46:03.379 --> 46:05.422
Joaquin tried to stop me from going,
but Lito fought him.

46:05.506 --> 46:07.090
It was-- It was unbelievable.

46:07.174 --> 46:09.844
It was like a scene
from one of his movies!

46:12.179 --> 46:16.016
And... what about the pictures?

46:18.018 --> 46:19.562
I don't care.

46:22.565 --> 46:24.817
My career is important to me.

46:26.527 --> 46:29.029
But it will never be as important as you.

46:36.620 --> 46:37.914
I love you.

46:47.673 --> 46:48.799
[camera clicks]

46:50.843 --> 46:51.969
[clicks]

46:52.970 --> 46:53.930
Really?

46:55.055 --> 46:56.849
He said he didn't care.

46:56.933 --> 46:57.975
[chuckles]

47:00.310 --> 47:03.146
[softly] Can we go home... please?

47:05.608 --> 47:09.946
- [whispers] Yes.
- Yes! Yes! Let's go home! Mm!

47:33.510 --> 47:36.305
[dramatic orchestral opening]

47:36.388 --> 47:39.600
[up-tempo piano]

47:52.989 --> 47:56.450
[dramatic orchestral ensemble]

47:56.533 --> 47:59.161
[solo piano resumes]

48:20.057 --> 48:22.225
[dramatic orchestral ensemble]

48:43.288 --> 48:44.915
[piano resumes]

49:01.640 --> 49:04.476
- [inaudible scenes]
- [music continues]
