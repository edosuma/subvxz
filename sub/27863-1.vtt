20:00.486 --> 20:01.789
- You lost?

20:01.789 --> 20:03.560
- No, just...

20:04.420 --> 20:05.253
broken down.

20:05.253 --> 20:06.706
- You need a lift?

20:06.706 --> 20:07.995
Sorry.

20:07.995 --> 20:08.983
Got my mess in here.

20:08.983 --> 20:11.000
- No, it's all right, I
called the breakdown service.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.833
Don't have to stop but thanks.

20:14.930 --> 20:15.830
- [Man] All right.

20:46.527 --> 20:49.617
- Oh, here we go.
- Will it be long?

20:49.617 --> 20:50.700
- No, thanks.

20:58.698 --> 21:00.948
(groaning)

21:02.005 --> 21:03.002
- [Man] Will they be long?

21:03.002 --> 21:04.279
- No, they're on their way.

21:04.279 --> 21:05.690
- Well, there'll be traffic
and all that, won't there?

21:05.690 --> 21:06.590
Rush hour now.

21:06.590 --> 21:07.423
- Hmmm.

21:09.370 --> 21:11.273
No point in both of us being late home.

21:12.270 --> 21:13.310
Thanks for stopping though.

21:13.310 --> 21:15.637
- Oh, I'm not to home tonight anyway.

21:20.255 --> 21:25.255
- Get off my fucking car.

21:28.122 --> 21:29.289
Just get lost.

21:31.622 --> 21:32.455
- Is there anything you need?

21:32.455 --> 21:33.580
I got snacks in the car.

21:33.580 --> 21:35.553
- No, I'm fine, honestly, really.

21:36.970 --> 21:37.803
Thanks.

21:39.284 --> 21:40.117
Sod off.

21:47.590 --> 21:49.076
Actually,

21:49.076 --> 21:51.650
there is one thing that
you could do for me.

21:51.650 --> 21:52.483
On your way up the road,

21:52.483 --> 21:53.450
if you could just give them a ring

21:53.450 --> 21:55.870
and hurry them up, that would be great.

21:55.870 --> 21:57.063
- Yeah, I can do that.

21:58.080 --> 21:58.980
What's the number?

22:01.500 --> 22:02.503
- The usual one.

22:03.970 --> 22:05.070
I see you're a member.

22:06.130 --> 22:06.963
- Yeah.

22:08.230 --> 22:09.063
Okay.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.430
(phone beeping)

22:11.430 --> 22:12.263
Oh, shit.

22:19.340 --> 22:20.440
I don't have a signal.

22:21.404 --> 22:22.960
Must be out of range.

22:22.960 --> 22:24.110
- Yeah, I think we are.

22:25.887 --> 22:27.003
- But you got through.

22:28.330 --> 22:29.350
- Yeah.

22:29.350 --> 22:30.183
Weird.

22:31.690 --> 22:33.270
- Well that's great, listen,

22:33.270 --> 22:34.570
I can wait with you.

22:34.570 --> 22:36.530
I've been on the road for
hours, I might catch a nap.

22:36.530 --> 22:37.770
- No, honestly, I'm fine.

22:37.770 --> 22:39.063
I'm absolutely fine.

22:40.489 --> 22:41.363
- I'll be back here if you need me, okay?

22:42.864 --> 22:43.697
- Okay.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.832
- I'm Paul, by the way.

22:47.832 --> 22:48.665
- Cool.

23:03.295 --> 23:06.045
(birds chirping)

23:37.617 --> 23:38.867
Whatever to do.

23:41.742 --> 23:43.992
- Are they not coming then?

23:46.853 --> 23:48.170
- They're a bit backed up

23:48.170 --> 23:49.633
but they said they're on their way.

23:51.410 --> 23:52.760
Thanks for stopping though.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.728
- I could try them using your phone.

23:58.728 --> 24:00.390
I don't have a signal.

24:00.390 --> 24:01.530
Tell you what.

24:01.530 --> 24:04.390
How about I drive you to
the nearest service station?

24:04.390 --> 24:05.440
I'll give you a tour.

24:07.020 --> 24:08.119
- What, the one back there?

24:08.119 --> 24:08.952
- Oh yeah.

24:10.210 --> 24:11.960
Private members thing or something.

24:13.630 --> 24:15.330
I thought you looked out of place.

24:16.780 --> 24:17.977
- I think I'll just
wait here with the car.

24:17.977 --> 24:19.570
- But the next village,
I'm sure there's one

24:19.570 --> 24:20.420
just up the road.

24:21.500 --> 24:22.550
- No, I'll wait here.

24:23.990 --> 24:25.590
I like it out here, it's peaceful.

24:25.590 --> 24:28.040
- Yeah, that's because
everyone's using that new bypass.

24:28.040 --> 24:29.113
This is all dead now.

24:30.990 --> 24:33.040
Not safe, you being out here on your own.

24:34.743 --> 24:36.460
(chuckling)

24:36.460 --> 24:38.180
- Well, I think you're right.

24:38.180 --> 24:40.160
I'll--
- Sorry.

24:40.160 --> 24:42.553
- Wait in here until they come, thanks.

25:22.127 --> 25:24.627
(eerie music)

25:34.030 --> 25:35.363
- You all right?

25:37.324 --> 25:38.824
You don't look it.

25:44.330 --> 25:45.163
Chicken soup?

25:48.333 --> 25:49.870
- No.

25:49.870 --> 25:50.703
- Nope?

25:53.033 --> 25:58.033
Okay.

26:03.659 --> 26:06.326
(ominous music)

26:11.500 --> 26:14.333
(birds squawking)

26:38.075 --> 26:39.575
- Can you hear me?

26:45.852 --> 26:46.685
Damn it!

26:53.668 --> 26:55.835
(sighing)

27:14.744 --> 27:17.411
(ominous music)

27:41.854 --> 27:44.687
(birds squawking)

28:25.556 --> 28:26.986
(sighing)

28:26.986 --> 28:29.819
(urine trickling)

28:39.706 --> 28:41.530
(cracking)

28:41.530 --> 28:42.363
Fuck sake!

28:42.363 --> 28:43.196
- Sorry.

28:43.196 --> 28:44.827
- You fucking bastard!

28:44.827 --> 28:45.950
You're unbelievable!

28:45.950 --> 28:47.533
- I didn't know what you were doing.

29:01.860 --> 29:02.733
I'm really sorry.

29:07.290 --> 29:09.290
Listen, you've got the wrong impression.

29:10.290 --> 29:13.310
Earlier, in the car park, I
was minding my own business.

29:13.310 --> 29:15.708
Wasn't sure if I should
say anything to you.

29:15.708 --> 29:17.483
You seemed pretty spooked already.

29:19.560 --> 29:22.040
Creepy place, couldn't go in their myself.

29:22.040 --> 29:23.063
Not very friendly.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.640
And I know I probably
freaked you out again

29:25.640 --> 29:28.013
but I just wanted to know
that you were all right.

29:39.504 --> 29:42.400
I suppose you really haven't
called the services out,

29:42.400 --> 29:43.616
have you?

29:43.616 --> 29:46.283
(ominous music)

29:48.580 --> 29:50.323
I'm up and down this road a lot.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.343
It's not safe.

29:55.480 --> 29:56.577
Maybe something's upset you

29:56.577 --> 29:59.130
and you get on the road to escape it

29:59.130 --> 30:02.130
and all you can see ahead of
you is what you want to forget.

30:03.960 --> 30:06.010
Some people park up and leave the car

30:06.010 --> 30:08.583
to get on to a bridge
and fling themselves off.

30:10.576 --> 30:11.409
It happens.

30:13.600 --> 30:15.212
I've seen it.

30:15.212 --> 30:17.879
(ominous music)

30:25.697 --> 30:29.197
You're not one of them suicidals, are you?

30:30.077 --> 30:32.568
(foreboding music)

30:32.568 --> 30:34.160
Look, if you're even thinking about it,

30:34.160 --> 30:35.933
please don't do anything silly.

30:39.900 --> 30:42.550
If you need to speak to
someone, you can speak to me.

30:47.535 --> 30:52.535
Tell Paul.

30:55.032 --> 30:55.865
Tell Paul.

31:02.158 --> 31:04.241
There's no one else here.

31:08.825 --> 31:11.492
(ominous music)

31:21.992 --> 31:24.325
(sniffling)

31:35.201 --> 31:38.034
(birds squawking)

31:50.454 --> 31:52.996
(engine revving)

31:52.996 --> 31:55.913
(tyres screeching)

31:57.708 --> 31:59.875
(sighing)

32:34.278 --> 32:35.111
- Okay.

32:49.103 --> 32:51.770
(ominous music)

33:37.419 --> 33:39.919
(eerie music)

34:02.027 --> 34:03.650
I called my boyfriend, he's on his way

34:03.650 --> 34:05.170
and he's really pissed
off about my guitar.

34:05.170 --> 34:06.003
- You know what?

34:09.608 --> 34:12.440
(engine rumbling)

34:15.433 --> 34:16.493
I got us some help.

34:31.159 --> 34:31.993
Johnno.

34:31.993 --> 34:34.148
- Paul, mate, hey there.

34:34.148 --> 34:37.065
(muffled speaking)

34:38.652 --> 34:39.985
Yeah, you ready?

34:45.797 --> 34:48.859
(ominous music)

34:48.859 --> 34:51.530
(knocking)

34:51.530 --> 34:52.362
Open it.

35:15.530 --> 35:17.100
- He says it's fixable but his tools

35:17.100 --> 35:19.580
aren't the right calibration for it.

35:19.580 --> 35:21.243
There's a workshop just along the road.

35:22.946 --> 35:25.613
(ominous music)

35:58.066 --> 36:00.727
- We're gonna push you up
to the front of the ramp

36:00.727 --> 36:02.571
and I'll stick it straight in,

36:02.571 --> 36:04.121
take you wherever you wanna go.

36:05.020 --> 36:05.853
- Cool.

36:08.410 --> 36:09.520
- Comfy body work.

36:10.970 --> 36:11.803
Very cute.

36:14.997 --> 36:16.233
Boy is she nice.

36:18.020 --> 36:18.993
Big old rod.

36:21.031 --> 36:22.140
We'll take her out,

36:23.290 --> 36:24.733
open her right up.

36:28.113 --> 36:28.946
So?

36:31.027 --> 36:31.910
- So what?

36:31.910 --> 36:34.243
- Are you gonna take it off?

36:37.656 --> 36:38.573
Your brake.

36:40.733 --> 36:42.150
It's a bit stiff.

36:47.780 --> 36:50.985
You're not from around here, are you?

36:50.985 --> 36:52.157
(thudding)

36:52.157 --> 36:53.157
Line her up.

36:54.363 --> 36:57.030
(ominous music)

37:18.780 --> 37:19.613
What you doing?

37:19.613 --> 37:21.196
Turn the break off.

37:22.228 --> 37:23.061
(thudding)
What you doing?

37:23.061 --> 37:26.215
Don't muck about, take the hand brake off.

37:26.215 --> 37:27.048
What's the matter?

37:27.048 --> 37:29.400
What, you're scared? What you scared of?

37:29.400 --> 37:30.233
I'll fucking scare you!

37:30.233 --> 37:31.390
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

37:31.390 --> 37:32.320
- Whoa? Whoa? Whoa?

37:32.320 --> 37:34.184
What? What are you getting big with?

37:34.184 --> 37:35.017
What're you doing?

37:35.017 --> 37:36.820
You think you're fucking getting engaged?

37:36.820 --> 37:37.993
Ask when ready, yeah?

37:39.153 --> 37:40.880
This is what it fucking is, all right?

37:40.880 --> 37:41.713
This is what it is.

37:41.713 --> 37:43.560
If you're not up for it,
fuck off back to your car

37:43.560 --> 37:44.930
and wank yourself off all day.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.140
Do whatever it is you do
but stop doing it around us!

37:47.140 --> 37:49.366
At your fucking leaser.

37:49.366 --> 37:50.330
Move out the way! You!

37:50.330 --> 37:51.710
You, you cunt, open the door!

37:51.710 --> 37:54.270
Open the fucking door, you little whore!

37:54.270 --> 37:55.826
You're a fucking little whore!

37:55.826 --> 37:57.277
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

37:57.277 --> 38:00.823
I'm gonna fucking bang
on the fucking wood!

38:00.823 --> 38:02.196
Come here, you cunt!

38:02.196 --> 38:04.863
(ominous music)

38:12.986 --> 38:15.986
You're a long fucking way from home!

38:18.870 --> 38:20.410
- What was all that about?

38:22.930 --> 38:24.670
He seemed all right and
he was up for helping

38:24.670 --> 38:26.270
but you never can tell, can you?

38:48.535 --> 38:51.118
I think I should get going now.

39:39.034 --> 39:41.855
(truck engine rumbling)

39:41.855 --> 39:44.522
(ominous music)

39:56.855 --> 39:59.105
(thudding)

40:00.734 --> 40:03.484
(menacing music)

40:09.395 --> 40:11.645
(groaning)

40:19.693 --> 40:20.860
- He's coming.

40:22.882 --> 40:24.549
He's fucking coming!

40:28.826 --> 40:30.993
(huffing)

40:33.528 --> 40:36.361
(engine rumbling)

40:47.349 --> 40:49.606
(faint speaking on phone)

40:49.606 --> 40:50.439
- Police.

40:51.657 --> 40:53.364
My car's broken down.

40:53.364 --> 40:56.281
I think someone's trying to get me.

40:58.159 --> 41:00.318
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

41:00.318 --> 41:01.445
There are two of them.

41:01.445 --> 41:04.862
One of them tried to run me off the road.

41:08.701 --> 41:11.197
Where the fuck am I?

41:11.197 --> 41:14.564
I'm somewhere off--
(beeping)

41:14.564 --> 41:15.397
Fuck!

41:16.352 --> 41:18.602
- It's okay, he's gone now.

41:37.071 --> 41:37.904
Hello?

41:42.106 --> 41:44.939
(birds squawking)

41:48.978 --> 41:51.153
(whimpering)

41:51.153 --> 41:53.453
I'm sorry, I didn't know he was a lunatic.

42:06.282 --> 42:08.573
It's cold out here,
you'll catch your death.

42:18.990 --> 42:20.590
Don't wanna leave you like this.

42:25.850 --> 42:27.700
Can't let it happen again, not again.

42:31.782 --> 42:34.290
You know, when I was 10,

42:34.290 --> 42:36.990
coming home from the cost on the train,

42:36.990 --> 42:39.263
I saw a woman throw herself off a bridge.

42:41.600 --> 42:43.750
Didn't see her land
but I knew that was it.

42:45.340 --> 42:47.820
Anyway, about a week
later saw on the news.

42:47.820 --> 42:48.883
Body's been found.

42:50.460 --> 42:52.360
Stuck down the side of a cattle grate.

43:00.280 --> 43:03.030
It's your last chance for a lift.

43:04.380 --> 43:07.130
(birds chirping)

43:09.986 --> 43:11.460
I don't wanna hear about you on the news.

43:11.460 --> 43:12.993
I'll never forgive myself.

43:19.250 --> 43:20.097
I'm going now.

43:29.245 --> 43:30.328
Stupid bitch.

44:17.123 --> 44:19.873
(engine revving)

44:21.350 --> 44:24.350
(faint radio music)

44:54.495 --> 44:57.245
(engine revving)

44:58.326 --> 44:59.159
- Fuck!

45:03.409 --> 45:06.312
(cranking)

45:06.312 --> 45:09.062
(engine revving)

45:11.459 --> 45:13.410
- Your distributor.

45:13.410 --> 45:14.513
The lane's damaged.

45:15.480 --> 45:17.180
- Isn't there anything you can do?

45:19.040 --> 45:20.578
- No.

45:20.578 --> 45:22.953
You're gonna need a replacement.

45:22.953 --> 45:23.786
- Okay.

45:25.240 --> 45:26.340
Thanks for telling me.

45:29.680 --> 45:31.423
- I've waited long enough.

45:35.870 --> 45:37.763
- Will you please leave me alone?

45:41.550 --> 45:44.573
Isn't there someone
anywhere that's missing you?

45:47.530 --> 45:48.363
- Nope.

45:49.830 --> 45:52.227
- Well I've called the police
and they're on their way.

46:05.654 --> 46:09.204
You fucking won't leave me alone!

46:09.204 --> 46:10.037
Please!

46:39.738 --> 46:44.738
(glass shattering)
(menacing music)

46:45.958 --> 46:47.078
(screaming)

46:47.078 --> 46:47.911
No!

46:55.342 --> 46:57.283
(screaming)

46:57.283 --> 46:58.202
No!

46:58.202 --> 46:59.035
No! No!

47:00.118 --> 47:00.951
No!

47:03.226 --> 47:05.559
(screaming)

47:18.168 --> 47:19.418
- Scream again.

47:21.425 --> 47:23.758
(screaming)

47:27.704 --> 47:32.037
(crying)
(shushing)

47:50.905 --> 47:53.322
(whimpering)

48:03.164 --> 48:05.331
(gasping)

48:11.070 --> 48:13.070
I came over to help you.

48:15.463 --> 48:17.117
Instead of teasing you.

48:20.290 --> 48:21.540
- You're right.

48:22.448 --> 48:23.281
I'm sorry.

48:24.670 --> 48:26.228
I'm sorry.

48:26.228 --> 48:27.242
I'm sorry.

48:27.242 --> 48:28.492
- You're sorry?

48:30.247 --> 48:32.280
- I was just scared.

48:32.280 --> 48:35.304
I was just scared and I
wasn't thinking straight

48:35.304 --> 48:37.118
and you're right, and
you're right, you're right.

48:37.118 --> 48:38.030
I should've let you help me

48:38.030 --> 48:41.990
because I know you're kind actually.

48:41.990 --> 48:43.270
You're a kind man

48:44.930 --> 48:47.010
and you would've helped me

48:47.010 --> 48:48.791
and I should've just let you.

48:48.791 --> 48:52.637
Let's just forget about all of this

48:54.297 --> 48:55.630
and start again.

48:56.757 --> 48:59.757
And you can help me and
I'll let you help me.

48:59.757 --> 49:01.740
And we don't need to do any of this

49:02.735 --> 49:06.733
and we can just be kind to each other.

49:06.733 --> 49:09.568
We can just be kind to each other.

49:09.568 --> 49:10.985
We can be tender.

49:12.750 --> 49:14.497
Because I know that you
don't wanna do this.

49:14.497 --> 49:18.278
I know that you're not a bad man, really.

49:18.278 --> 49:19.278
You're soft.

49:20.615 --> 49:22.365
You are, you're soft.

49:25.698 --> 49:26.749
You're soft.

49:26.749 --> 49:27.749
- I'm sorry.

49:28.997 --> 49:31.080
I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

49:35.114 --> 49:36.114
- I'm sorry.

49:40.338 --> 49:42.066
(menacing music)

49:42.066 --> 49:44.149
(crying)

49:45.200 --> 49:46.158
- Please!

49:46.158 --> 49:47.158
Please stop!

49:48.712 --> 49:50.795
(crying)

49:52.837 --> 49:56.157
(menacing music)

49:56.157 --> 49:58.574

50:04.905 --> 50:06.988

50:23.875 --> 50:26.625
(engine revving)

50:30.031 --> 50:32.948
(faint beat music)

50:37.872 --> 50:40.120
- Wow, what a day, huh?

50:40.120 --> 50:41.370
Are you hungry?

50:42.367 --> 50:43.200
- No.

50:45.360 --> 50:46.863
- Got a cold burger here.

50:48.957 --> 50:49.790
Huh?

50:51.077 --> 50:52.994
Had an apple somewhere.

50:56.250 --> 50:57.333
Chicken soup?

50:59.290 --> 51:00.883
At least I think it's chicken.

51:02.039 --> 51:03.872
- I'm fine, thank you.

51:04.964 --> 51:08.464
(faint smooth jazz music)

51:10.350 --> 51:12.270
- [Paul] You like this one?

51:12.270 --> 51:13.103
- Yeah.

51:14.930 --> 51:15.880
- I don't, hold on.

51:17.037 --> 51:18.800
(radio tuning)

51:18.800 --> 51:20.741
Yeah, this will do us.

51:20.741 --> 51:24.491
(faint pleasant radio music)

51:28.582 --> 51:30.665
You all right back there?

51:32.247 --> 51:33.580
- Yep, I'm fine.

51:36.475 --> 51:37.808
- Don't look it.

51:39.458 --> 51:41.875
(whispering)

51:44.079 --> 51:45.079
What's that?

51:46.250 --> 51:47.917
- Let me go, please.

51:49.162 --> 51:50.413
Please.

51:50.413 --> 51:52.661
(sobbing)

51:52.661 --> 51:54.040
- Please don't cry.

51:54.040 --> 51:56.207
(sobbing)

51:57.430 --> 51:59.992
Please stop crying, it upsets me.

51:59.992 --> 52:02.075
(crying)

52:07.578 --> 52:08.495
Guess what,

52:10.413 --> 52:11.496
I'm a doctor.

52:12.403 --> 52:15.986
(faint upbeat radio music)

52:20.078 --> 52:20.911
You cold?

52:22.032 --> 52:24.540
Little bit of fucking heat--

52:24.540 --> 52:26.810
(laughing)

52:26.810 --> 52:27.643
That's funny.

52:28.610 --> 52:30.260
Wait, that's enough!

52:30.260 --> 52:32.662
I said that's enough!

52:32.662 --> 52:33.495
Bitch!

52:36.034 --> 52:37.456
(yelping)

52:37.456 --> 52:38.289
Oh, fuck.

52:41.658 --> 52:43.740
(yelling)

52:43.740 --> 52:44.573
Let go!

52:46.410 --> 52:48.288
(screaming)

52:48.288 --> 52:51.238
Fucking let go, you little bitch!

52:51.238 --> 52:56.238

53:11.493 --> 53:14.410
(tyres screeching)

53:15.694 --> 53:17.495
Fucking let go!

53:17.495 --> 53:19.662
(gagging)

53:24.741 --> 53:28.324
(faint upbeat radio music)

53:29.858 --> 53:32.191

(faint upbeat radio music)

54:38.698 --> 54:41.329
(crying)

54:41.329 --> 54:43.615
- [Radio DJ] If you're just
joining us, where have you been?

54:43.615 --> 54:46.488
Don't worry, you're here now
and all sins are forgiven.

54:46.488 --> 54:48.251
We're just coming up to--

54:48.251 --> 54:51.251
(traffic commotion)

54:56.576 --> 55:00.076
(muffled radio commotion)

55:31.885 --> 55:34.885

55:46.086 --> 55:48.753

56:01.373 --> 56:04.540
(distant dog barking)

56:07.414 --> 56:09.914
(owl hooting)

56:11.616 --> 56:12.949
- You're joking.

56:17.388 --> 56:19.638
(laughing)

56:48.742 --> 56:51.742
(traffic whooshing)

57:13.841 --> 57:16.424

58:09.000 --> 58:11.167
(booming)

58:13.457 --> 58:15.874
(whimpering)

58:25.753 --> 58:27.669
- You all right?

58:27.669 --> 58:28.836
What happened?

58:30.970 --> 58:31.863
Can you move?

58:32.960 --> 58:34.013
Don't move.

58:35.140 --> 58:36.190
Can you feel my hand?

58:38.660 --> 58:39.503
I'm Jules.

58:40.776 --> 58:41.609
- He...

58:43.203 --> 58:44.036
The car...

58:45.152 --> 58:46.413
- What?

58:46.413 --> 58:50.857
- He tried to kill me.

58:50.857 --> 58:52.237
- [Jules] What?

58:52.237 --> 58:54.070
- He tried to kill me.

58:59.140 --> 58:59.973
- Hold on.

59:01.623 --> 59:03.873
(groaning)

59:05.199 --> 59:07.866
(ominous music)

59:38.530 --> 59:42.119
(engine rumbling)

59:42.119 --> 59:45.036
(tyres screeching)

59:52.169 --> 59:55.419
(faint siren alarming)

01:00:03.753 --> 01:00:06.503
(siren alarming)

01:00:10.969 --> 01:00:13.219
(coughing)

01:00:29.035 --> 01:00:31.202
(gasping)

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:40.723
- So, you feeling better now?

01:00:42.310 --> 01:00:43.160
Where's your car?

01:00:45.038 --> 01:00:47.320
You're in a bit of a mess, aren't you?

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:48.243
You been drinking?

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:50.673
- No.

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:52.943
He tried to kill me.

01:00:52.943 --> 01:00:55.180
- You're not one of
them suicides, are you?

01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:56.774
- Little bit shaken up.

01:00:56.774 --> 01:00:58.820
Looks like another stiff.

01:00:58.820 --> 01:00:59.653
Not making much sense.

01:00:59.653 --> 01:01:00.710
Could be a time waster.

01:01:02.419 --> 01:01:04.463
- [Officer] So, what's his name?

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:07.962
- I didn't get his name.

01:01:07.962 --> 01:01:09.800
- [Officer] Look, if it's a domestic--

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.410
- It's not a domestic.

01:01:11.410 --> 01:01:13.530
How could it be a domestic out here?

01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:14.900
- I don't know, some
people get a bit testy

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.391
after a long drive.

01:01:16.391 --> 01:01:17.710
- I don't know who he was.

01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:19.420
I was travelling alone.

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:21.360
- Decide what you wanna do then.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:22.500
We just need a few details--

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.220
- I was attacked.

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:27.100
He tried to kidnap me
and I fought him off.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.410
- Where did he pick you up?

01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:31.793
- My car is back down
that way on a slip road.

01:01:32.699 --> 01:01:33.960
They must've moved it.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.560
- So you been up on a side road?

01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:38.570
- He followed me.

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.193
He saw me at the truck stop.

01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:43.490
The one over that hill.

01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:45.360
- That's just trees, love.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:46.343
- Past the trees.

01:01:49.090 --> 01:01:50.417
I think they did something to my car.

01:01:50.417 --> 01:01:51.250
- They?

01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:58.950
- It's just over there.

01:01:58.950 --> 01:02:00.230
Why don't you go and take a look?

01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:02.460
- So you said you met them at a truck stop

01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:04.263
and they followed you to a slip road.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.238
- Then he got a bit rough,
didn't want to pay you.

01:02:11.238 --> 01:02:12.488
- How dare you.

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:15.380
- We'll drive around, shall we?

01:02:16.956 --> 01:02:18.856
Have a little look at your truck stop.

01:02:20.161 --> 01:02:21.537
Fuck.

01:02:21.537 --> 01:02:24.204
(ominous music)

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.800
- There's places like
this up and down the road.

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.190
You sure this is the right one?

01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:48.260
- Yes.

01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:50.170
They use the lady's toilet as storage

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:54.840
and there's loads of water
on the floor of the gents.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:55.999
- There's always water on the floor.

01:02:55.999 --> 01:02:57.240
(laughing)

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.850
- [Sergeant] Yeah but it aint water.

01:02:58.850 --> 01:03:00.380
- My guitar was stolen as well.

01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:01.780
- You reporting a theft now?

01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:05.420
- And there was a girl.

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:06.753
I heard her voice.

01:03:06.753 --> 01:03:07.880
- Ah.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:08.713
Competition.

01:03:08.713 --> 01:03:10.070
- What?

01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:12.920
- Before I go in there
and make a fool of myself,

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:15.720
are you on drugs because
your story keeps changing.

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.193
- No, I'm clean!

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.700
- You're wasting our
time, you'll be arrested.

01:03:26.548 --> 01:03:29.630
(door thudding)

01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:31.480
- Do you recognise any of the trucks?

01:03:34.249 --> 01:03:35.503
- It happened.

01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:40.992
The man's car was parked right over there.

01:03:40.992 --> 01:03:43.585
(ominous music)

01:03:43.585 --> 01:03:45.797
That's it, that's the car.

01:03:48.578 --> 01:03:51.078
(eerie music)

01:03:57.830 --> 01:04:00.915
- [Officer] Dispatch, I
need a registration check.

01:04:00.915 --> 01:04:02.831
November, eight, four, five,

01:04:02.831 --> 01:04:04.081
delta, foxtrot.

01:04:06.228 --> 01:04:08.895
(ominous music)

01:04:10.864 --> 01:04:12.000
- All of the regulars in there.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.290
- He's one of them.

01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:15.400
- These places always attract parasites.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.870
Hanging around truck
stops dressed like that

01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:19.320
doesn't help either, does it?

01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:22.080
- I say we just do her anyway, sarge.

01:04:23.010 --> 01:04:26.770
Nicole Reed, I'm arresting you
for trespassing on a motorway

01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:28.333
and for wasting police time.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.110
- Hey!

01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:33.869
Just leave her alone, okay?

01:04:33.869 --> 01:04:36.536
(ominous music)

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:41.590
You clean yourself up, grab
a tea and stay off the road.

01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:42.790
- Well can I get a lift?

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:44.930
- [Sergeant] No.

01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:45.763
Call a cab.

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:49.531
(sergeant mumbling)

01:04:49.531 --> 01:04:50.364
Go ahead.

01:04:53.362 --> 01:04:57.112
(police car engine rumbling)

01:05:02.749 --> 01:05:05.499
(sinister music)

01:05:12.199 --> 01:05:13.616
- Okay, let's go!

01:05:17.282 --> 01:05:20.282
(suspenseful music)

01:05:21.382 --> 01:05:22.215
Come on!

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.987
(men whistling)

01:05:40.201 --> 01:05:42.368

01:05:43.994 --> 01:05:46.994
(suspenseful music)

01:06:01.082 --> 01:06:03.572
(men whistling)

01:06:03.572 --> 01:06:05.322
Come on, little girl!

01:06:10.916 --> 01:06:13.499
(men laughing)

01:06:15.833 --> 01:06:18.991
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

01:06:18.991 --> 01:06:21.241
(groaning)

01:06:22.529 --> 01:06:25.454
(distant dog barking)

01:06:25.454 --> 01:06:27.954
(men yelling)

01:06:29.374 --> 01:06:31.957

01:06:40.447 --> 01:06:42.947
(eerie music)

01:06:46.616 --> 01:06:48.866
(shushing)

01:06:55.241 --> 01:06:56.574
- [Man] Go back!

01:06:57.527 --> 01:06:59.860
(whistling)

01:07:06.285 --> 01:07:07.118
- Run.

01:07:10.158 --> 01:07:10.991
Run.

01:07:14.028 --> 01:07:15.535
- Shit!

01:07:15.535 --> 01:07:17.582
(men whistling)

01:07:17.582 --> 01:07:18.415
- Run.

01:07:20.609 --> 01:07:23.276
(ominous music)

01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:28.070

01:07:50.539 --> 01:07:53.416
(gasping)

01:07:53.416 --> 01:07:54.249
- No!

01:07:57.623 --> 01:07:58.623
- It's okay.

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:00.866
It's okay.

01:08:00.866 --> 01:08:03.116
(shushing)

01:08:05.988 --> 01:08:07.238
It's all right.

01:08:09.290 --> 01:08:11.040
He should've just let you drive on.

01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:15.093
Now we're gonna have to clear
the little prick's mess.

01:08:18.822 --> 01:08:19.721
Let's make it fun.

01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:21.783
Aye?

01:08:23.241 --> 01:08:25.706
It's better when it's fun.

01:08:25.706 --> 01:08:27.872
(slicing)

01:08:29.457 --> 01:08:31.624

01:09:17.421 --> 01:09:20.254
(engine rumbling)

01:09:35.241 --> 01:09:36.908
- Can you let me in?

01:09:40.770 --> 01:09:42.162
- How can I help you?

01:09:42.162 --> 01:09:44.577
- Will you let me in?

01:09:44.577 --> 01:09:45.747
- Sorry, not allowed.

01:09:45.747 --> 01:09:47.910
Tell me what you want and I can.

01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:49.529
- He's trying to kill me!

01:09:49.529 --> 01:09:50.830
Will you let me in?!

01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:55.990
- My boss says people
say that all the time.

01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:58.114
Now I can call the police for you.

01:09:58.114 --> 01:09:59.328
- No!

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:00.490
No.

01:10:00.490 --> 01:10:03.912
Don't call the police.

01:10:03.912 --> 01:10:07.501
Will you just open the door, please?

01:10:07.501 --> 01:10:08.334
Please?

01:10:09.462 --> 01:10:10.379
Okay, look,

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:12.073
call my mom.

01:10:14.417 --> 01:10:15.250
Her number is--

01:10:15.250 --> 01:10:17.217
- Not allowed personal calls, sorry.

01:10:20.038 --> 01:10:25.038
- Will you help me, please?

01:10:25.297 --> 01:10:28.326
- There's nothing in here worth nicking.

01:10:28.326 --> 01:10:29.195
- Please!

01:10:29.195 --> 01:10:32.336
- I mean, I'm not saying
you're a thief but, you know.

01:10:32.336 --> 01:10:35.286
- You fucking will let me in!

01:10:35.286 --> 01:10:36.119
Please!

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.073
Please!

01:10:39.616 --> 01:10:41.783
(gasping)

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:49.827
Are you one of them?

01:10:52.481 --> 01:10:55.533
Will you fucking all leave me alone?!

01:10:55.533 --> 01:10:58.074
Don't come near me!

01:10:58.074 --> 01:10:59.324
Leave me alone!

01:11:00.871 --> 01:11:02.121
Leave me alone.

01:11:03.196 --> 01:11:05.196
I haven't done anything.

01:11:06.618 --> 01:11:08.701

01:12:17.623 --> 01:12:19.364
No, no, no, no, no, no, please!

01:12:19.364 --> 01:12:20.365
Please, wait, no!

01:12:20.365 --> 01:12:21.198
No, stop!

01:12:21.198 --> 01:12:22.744
Please, you have to help me!

01:12:22.744 --> 01:12:24.328
Wait! Wait!

01:12:24.328 --> 01:12:25.465
