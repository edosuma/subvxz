00:41.040 --> 00:44.750
Spring is not the
gentlest of seasons.

00:44.800 --> 00:48.510
It is as though too much
has been waiting to happen,

00:48.560 --> 00:52.830
too much suppressed, packed
down beneath the earth

00:52.880 --> 00:55.150
or pinned above the sky.

00:55.200 --> 01:00.040
Green shoots grow sharp and
the clouds are unforgiving.

01:07.120 --> 01:08.950
Ah!

01:26.200 --> 01:30.280
Spring can be brutal,
breaking open secrets.

01:31.480 --> 01:34.790
Dragging into light
those things unseen

01:34.840 --> 01:37.520
and giving voice to words unsaid.

01:43.080 --> 01:45.070
Stop the bus!

01:45.120 --> 01:48.870
Don't let it drive away!
I have Terence's sandwiches!

01:48.920 --> 01:50.750
Mrs Bissette, you
shouldn't be running!

01:50.800 --> 01:53.990
I always meet the 12.18.
Terence is the driver!

01:54.040 --> 01:57.350
You think I wouldn't have waited?

01:57.400 --> 01:59.910
It's public transport, Terence,
not your own private bus,

01:59.960 --> 02:03.150
~ you can't make the people late.
~ You go home, girl, and put your feet up.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.760
Tomorrow, I'll buy myself a pie.

02:14.080 --> 02:16.870
You can tell me, you know...

02:16.920 --> 02:20.030
what the hospital said
about your diagnosis.

02:20.080 --> 02:24.590
Of course, and tell the whole of
the Number 5 bus while I'm about it.

02:27.280 --> 02:31.150
Little boy for Doreen Gibbs.
It was quite an afternoon.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.590
She refused to lie down
for the second stage

02:33.640 --> 02:36.310
and gave birth kneeling
on the bedside rug.

02:36.360 --> 02:39.230
Then there was no coal for the fire.

02:39.280 --> 02:42.510
I had to bring the placenta back
to put in our incinerator.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.230
Oh, dear! No gardeners in the family?

02:45.280 --> 02:49.070
Erm... a Miss Beatrix Franklin
is wanted on the telephone!

02:49.120 --> 02:52.480
It's Claridge's calling about
your engagement party.

02:53.680 --> 02:56.080
I just want to get some ideas.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.550
Dettol, please, Barbara.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.390
The Woman's Realm might
be a riveting read,

03:05.440 --> 03:08.040
but it certainly isn't absorbent.

03:21.880 --> 03:24.240
Fibroids!

03:25.640 --> 03:27.270
Nothing more.

03:27.320 --> 03:31.200
Inconvenient, but not in any
way a threat to life or limb.

03:32.240 --> 03:36.190
They're of the opinion
that I need a hysterectomy.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.470
~ That's a major operation.
~ I've said no.

03:38.520 --> 03:42.430
~ But, Sister, you've been so unwell.
~ I'd be putting myself out of action!

03:42.480 --> 03:46.670
A full fortnight as an in-patient
and then four to six weeks recovery.

03:48.040 --> 03:49.870
We will manage, I assure you.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.870
~ How?
~ We've had word that the board
are sending a new midwife.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.390
~ You never said.
~ It's only just been confirmed.

03:56.440 --> 04:01.390
I've been asking for help ever
since Nurse Miller went to the
Mother House as a postulant

04:01.440 --> 04:06.480
~ and they've finally obliged,
which is really very timely.
~ Oh.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.550
In which case, I will
get myself seen to...

04:10.600 --> 04:14.510
and arrange for it all to be
done down near Chichester.

04:14.560 --> 04:17.390
No need for any great fanfare.

04:17.440 --> 04:21.110
It's just an old pocket in some
apron that I'll never use.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.670
Absolutely.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.200
Hmm!

04:31.520 --> 04:34.030
~ Would you like some to take home?
~ Ah, thank you.

04:34.080 --> 04:37.750
Hello, Mrs Hutchins. Does she look better this
morning? Let's have a look in those eyes.

04:37.800 --> 04:41.350
~ Where did you get it from?
~ It belonged to Mr Hereward's grandmother.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.800
You mean, it's second-hand?

04:48.760 --> 04:50.630
Where are we up to
with the urine tests?

04:50.680 --> 04:53.230
All done, all clear, all logged.

04:53.280 --> 04:57.550
Apart from Mrs Pisner's, which
arrived in a condensed-milk tin.

04:57.600 --> 05:01.030
I've sent her off to try and
squeeze out another sample.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.070
I'm starting to think
people around here

05:03.120 --> 05:06.120
don't understand about
antique jewellery.

05:08.120 --> 05:11.470
We'd recommend you buy two
dozen nappies to begin with,

05:11.520 --> 05:16.550
along with two lidded buckets for
soaking and a deep pan for boiling.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.630
Do they have to be boiled?

05:18.680 --> 05:20.590
I just bought a twin-tub
washing machine

05:20.640 --> 05:22.550
and I'm worried it
won't get hot enough.

05:22.600 --> 05:25.390
Washing machine? Get you!

05:25.440 --> 05:28.630
I put my government maternity
grant towards it.

05:28.680 --> 05:31.350
Well, we all get the same, don't we?

05:31.400 --> 05:35.830
Yes. And some of us get brand-new
council flats to boot, but not all.

05:35.880 --> 05:40.190
I think a washing machine is a
very wise purchase, Mrs Bissette.

05:40.240 --> 05:44.870
You cannot launder woollens
using electrical apparatus!

05:44.920 --> 05:48.030
The fibres will become disordered

05:48.080 --> 05:50.670
and the very essence
of the garment lost.

05:50.720 --> 05:53.750
I reckon knitted stuff's old-fashioned,

05:53.800 --> 05:55.350
I want my baby modern.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.270
I want my baby warm.

05:57.320 --> 06:01.270
I swear, I haven't had warm feet
since I came to this country.

06:01.320 --> 06:05.720
Well, I reckon I could do with
a pair of those bootees meself.

06:06.520 --> 06:10.120
I'll show you those china
catalogues later, Patsy.

06:13.800 --> 06:17.750
News certainly travels, I was
given free bananas when I cut
through Chrisp Street market.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.510
Well, there'll be no free bananas
at the St Blaise Hotel,

06:20.560 --> 06:24.030
but there is a wonderful canape
menu and only a guinea a head.

06:24.080 --> 06:27.150
~ A guinea a head?
~ It was three guineas at Claridge's!

06:27.200 --> 06:30.230
It's going to be glorious. I've
got 63 people on the guest list.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.150
Do we know 63 people?

06:32.200 --> 06:34.470
I mean, apart from
parishioners and patients?

06:34.520 --> 06:37.230
It would be a sorry state
of affairs if we didn't.

06:37.280 --> 06:40.470
We're mature people, Tom,
not teenage sweethearts.

06:40.520 --> 06:43.710
Well, I feel like a teenage
sweetheart when I look at you.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.830
Pack! Pack! Pack!

06:50.880 --> 06:54.390
Lads! Now, this is Nurse Mount,

06:54.440 --> 06:57.830
starting next week she's
going to be your new Akela.

06:57.880 --> 07:00.110
Do you want them in a horseshoe
or two straight lines?

07:00.160 --> 07:03.430
~ I'm afraid the protocol
isn't entirely clear.
~ Horseshoe.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.150
If this is supposed
to be a horseshoe,

07:09.200 --> 07:12.240
the poor horse has very strange feet.

07:14.280 --> 07:20.070
Well done, lads. Now, tonight we're going
to be practising fire-lighting technique

07:20.120 --> 07:22.830
for the display at
the district jamboree.

07:22.880 --> 07:25.270
~ Now, Bruce, have you got the flints?
~ Yep.

07:25.320 --> 07:28.110
~ Larry, have you got the
sticks and the string?
~ Yep.

07:28.160 --> 07:31.360
Righty-O, let's show Nurse
Mount how it's done!

07:36.000 --> 07:38.710
You're still here, then?

07:38.760 --> 07:43.030
I'm not even due for three
weeks... and well you know it.

07:43.080 --> 07:48.830
No! When I can't get out of a chair
on my own, I will tell you.

07:48.880 --> 07:51.160
You are magnificent, woman.

07:53.960 --> 07:56.430
Come here.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.880
The baby wants to dance.

07:59.880 --> 08:03.880
You wouldn't be so keen if
she was dancing inside of you.

08:07.760 --> 08:10.070
See, calypso baby.

08:10.120 --> 08:11.830
She knows where she come from.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.510
This baby is going to be a Londoner.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.710
I'm just going to make
sure she has warm feet.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.160
Come on.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.550
Remember, boys, no getting
your bandages wet.

08:27.600 --> 08:32.470
And tell your mothers you're to
come to Nonnatus tomorrow for
me to reapply the burns cream.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.549
Night, lads.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.919
Really, Fred, it wasn't
your finest hour.

08:55.360 --> 08:58.310
I hope this is a safe place to park.

08:58.360 --> 09:01.150
I don't want any footballs
through my windscreen.

09:01.200 --> 09:05.110
Phyllis Crane, SRN,
SCM. I am expected.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.510
Oh, of course. Hello.

09:07.560 --> 09:09.150
Hmm.

09:09.200 --> 09:14.150
When I was in training, we were
always taught to say good morning,
good afternoon or good evening.

09:14.200 --> 09:17.150
"Hello" would not
have been permitted.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.400
Unless we were talking
to Americans, perhaps.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.350
Lancashire hotpot!

09:30.400 --> 09:34.870
Do you know, I could quite
fancy a portion of this.

09:34.920 --> 09:37.120
After you, of course.

09:38.120 --> 09:41.350
I shall content myself with bread
and butter and some greens.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.280
I'm vegetarian.

09:44.600 --> 09:48.110
To whom should I give my petrol
receipts for reimbursement?

09:48.160 --> 09:49.830
I'll see to all of that.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.790
And, of course, I'll make sure that
you're supplied with a new uniform,

09:52.840 --> 09:55.430
then everyone will
know you're one of us.

09:55.480 --> 09:58.150
I'm sure the gesture is kindly meant,

09:58.200 --> 10:00.390
but as this is a temporary appointment,

10:00.440 --> 10:03.380
I'd prefer to remain
in my own clothes.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.880
Is that cabbage in that tureen?

10:10.720 --> 10:14.630
Very well, ladies, I'm demob
happy this afternoon,

10:14.680 --> 10:17.310
so there's nothing too
arduous on your lists.

10:17.360 --> 10:20.990
Nurse Gilbert, you're on
the district roster with me,

10:21.040 --> 10:24.550
~ haemorrhoids or insulin take your pick?
~ May I do the insulin rounds?

10:24.600 --> 10:28.470
~ All yours.
~ Excuse me, do you think that's wise?

10:28.520 --> 10:30.790
Insulin injections are routine,

10:30.840 --> 10:35.030
she should be spending her time on
midwifery, extending her experience.

10:35.080 --> 10:38.310
We don't mix our district
and midwifery rosters,

10:38.360 --> 10:40.750
we find it limits the
risk of cross-infection.

10:40.800 --> 10:44.430
Proper hygiene limits the
risk of cross-infection.

10:44.480 --> 10:47.590
I'd be interested to see
your sterilising protocols.

10:47.640 --> 10:50.910
~ And I'd be delighted
to take you through them.
~ Thank you.

10:50.960 --> 10:54.230
I've worked in very varied
establishments over the past few years,

10:54.280 --> 10:57.630
I try to absorb the best
aspects of each practice

10:57.680 --> 10:59.630
and take them forward with me.

10:59.680 --> 11:03.590
For example, log books are becoming
increasingly outmoded.

11:03.640 --> 11:07.080
I'm of the opinion you
ought to get a Rolodex.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.270
A Rolodex?

11:12.320 --> 11:14.150
It's the thin edge of the wedge.

11:14.200 --> 11:18.110
If Nurse Crane doesn't approve of the way
we run this ship, we will end up sinking.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.710
Nurse Crane is highly experienced,

11:20.760 --> 11:24.190
she's used to taking on quite senior
positions, however temporary,

11:24.240 --> 11:27.910
perhaps we can learn from
her in your absence.

11:27.960 --> 11:31.510
Learn what? How to cobble
a rag-bag of ideas together

11:31.560 --> 11:34.710
to come in temporarily and turn
everything upside down forever?

11:34.760 --> 11:38.190
No! She'll be the one
with things to learn.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.150
Oh, I've seen her sort,

11:40.200 --> 11:44.710
they never display an ounce of
compassion or... or kindness or...

11:47.320 --> 11:50.390
Nonnatus House. Sister
Julienne speaking.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.390
Oh, Reverend Mother.

11:52.440 --> 11:55.990
It's Mother Jesu Emmanuel calling
from the Mother House.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.230
Oh. Very well.

11:58.280 --> 12:00.620
You remember what I've said.

12:14.560 --> 12:15.870
Oh.

12:15.920 --> 12:19.950
~ Hello.
~ I refer you to our earlier conversation.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.440
Sorry, good evening.

12:24.440 --> 12:28.270
I asked that handyman to demarcate
the bedside and dressing tables

12:28.320 --> 12:30.630
to head off any contention
at the pass.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.830
A nice strip of insulating tape
down the middle of each of them.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.000
One side apiece.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.310
And then I had to change into
my nightie in front of her!

12:50.360 --> 12:53.830
~ What did she do?
~ Well, just carried on reading
her Journal Of Nursing.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.830
There's a glass of water by the bed,

12:55.880 --> 12:57.910
I'm scared she's going
to put her teeth in it.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.630
Trixie does that every
night and I survive.

13:00.680 --> 13:03.590
You can top up my Scotch
by way of an apology.

13:03.640 --> 13:07.720
Meanwhile, we bought some
Tizer... especially for you.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.990
So... a mystery benefactor.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.950
There's no mystery involved.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.990
He approached Mother Jesu Emmanuel

13:17.040 --> 13:21.430
and asked to meet with...
some sisters from the order.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.270
Oh, that's nice.

13:23.320 --> 13:26.790
If the meeting goes well,
he'll arrange a legacy,

13:26.840 --> 13:28.950
which may in due course

13:29.000 --> 13:33.390
help us continue our work with
the people that need us.

13:35.280 --> 13:38.190
Good morning! The early
bird catches the worm,

13:38.240 --> 13:41.950
~ which means Nurse...
~ Nurse Mount, Mrs Tucker's husband called.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.710
She's of the view that things are
on the move and as it's her fourth,
we'd be foolish not to heed her.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.470
Nurse Gilbert, you're
back on midwifery,

13:49.520 --> 13:53.150
there are three delivery packs to be
dropped off and a home inspection.

13:53.200 --> 13:58.950
I beg your pardon. Sister Julienne
led me to believe the morning lists
would be my responsibility.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.110
And they will be, as and when
I commence my sick leave.

14:02.160 --> 14:06.520
~ Aren't you leaving for
the Mother House today?
~ No, I'm not, my operation is postponed.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.670
I'm turning into quite the gadabout.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.750
Buses here, there and everywhere.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.480
Yes.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.710
Although you can't help but
wonder why this benefactor

14:23.760 --> 14:26.390
wants to help and give
money to the East End

14:26.440 --> 14:29.030
when he lives right on
the other side of London?

14:29.080 --> 14:32.880
When I first joined the order the
Postulant Mistress used to say...

14:34.240 --> 14:38.800
.."When a prayer is answered,
don't send a question back."

14:43.480 --> 14:47.230
It's very smart. I think
that's a Rolls-Royce.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.390
Or maybe a Bentley.

14:49.440 --> 14:53.270
I don't think they have a
statue on the bonnet though.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.260
Hello. I'm Anthony.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.280
~ You must be Sister Julienne.
~ Hello.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.310
It's terribly good of you to
come at such short notice.

15:05.360 --> 15:06.790
There was no reason to delay,

15:06.840 --> 15:11.150
especially after such a... kind
approach from Mr Newgarden.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.510
You and Dad are old pals,
in a manner of speaking.

15:13.560 --> 15:16.390
~ Really?
~ Our families were friendly

15:16.440 --> 15:19.350
when our fathers were posted
to Aden with the army.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.990
~ We were very small.
~ I see.

15:22.040 --> 15:23.550
I should take you through.

15:23.600 --> 15:27.230
You may find he tires very easily, though
he does a bit better now he has the oxygen.

15:27.280 --> 15:31.110
~ Is Mr Newgarden unwell?
~ He's had heart trouble for a while

15:31.160 --> 15:33.160
and now it's failing.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.740
That's why he's making his will.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.830
Come on in.

15:43.880 --> 15:47.510
I'm longer in the tooth than
I was when I saw you last.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.600
But I don't bite.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.830
How many years has it been?

15:55.000 --> 15:58.270
I think... not quite 30.

15:58.320 --> 16:00.240
Oh, please.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.870
Your blood pressure's a tiny
bit higher than I'd like.

16:21.920 --> 16:24.630
You aren't feeling dizzy
or unusually tired?

16:24.680 --> 16:28.150
No, just too heavy
to move around much.

16:28.200 --> 16:31.550
But I reckon baby's starting
to feel the same way.

16:31.600 --> 16:36.310
~ What makes you say that?
~ She's been a dancer since the
first day I felt her moving.

16:36.360 --> 16:39.830
Feet tapping, knees jerking.

16:39.880 --> 16:43.990
You could almost feel her
fingers click in time.

16:44.040 --> 16:48.360
But now she gone quiet, like
she danced herself to sleep.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.830
She's probably a bit too comfy.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.150
If you have a nice big
drink of cold water,

16:54.200 --> 16:57.600
you might find she gets
her tap shoes on again.

16:58.880 --> 17:02.350
You have a beautiful home
and a lovely garden too -

17:02.400 --> 17:04.510
what I can see of it
out of the window.

17:04.560 --> 17:07.230
We lived rather more
modestly than this

17:07.280 --> 17:10.550
until the National Health came along
and changed the... the world.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.069
You tell her.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.030
Mr Newgarden was an
optician by training

17:20.079 --> 17:22.390
who became a spectacle manufacture.

17:22.440 --> 17:28.510
Once the government made glasses
freely available to all who needed
them, business became very brisk.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.830
~ Oh, I can imagine.
~ Quite.

17:30.880 --> 17:34.440
And now it's time for me
to share my good fortune.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.600
~ Biscuit?
~ Lovely.

17:42.920 --> 17:46.550
~ There are none.
~ Kitchen's at the bottom of
the long passage, turn left.

17:46.600 --> 17:50.830
In fact, tell the housekeeper I
rather fancy some cinnamon toast.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.510
Cinnamon toast it is.

17:52.560 --> 17:54.840
Your wish is my command.

17:58.240 --> 18:01.150
What a relentlessly
good-natured young woman.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.230
There are times when
I'm very glad of it.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.480
Are you glad of it today?

18:06.280 --> 18:08.280
Yes... and no.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.910
You haven't changed.

18:10.960 --> 18:13.430
You know that's not true.

18:13.480 --> 18:17.390
You're still the pale, sweet
girl with the wave in her fringe

18:17.440 --> 18:22.440
who stood me up outside
the Palais Cinema in 1932.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.470
I'm sorry.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.320
I'm sorry, too.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.870
I still haven't seen Charlie
Chaplin in City Lights,

18:30.920 --> 18:34.220
and by all accounts it's
a bloody masterpiece.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.270
I should have done more than write.

18:37.320 --> 18:40.150
You deserved more than a
letter sent after the event.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.750
I treasured that letter!

18:42.800 --> 18:47.040
Did...did you...keep a souvenir?

18:48.040 --> 18:51.200
It wouldn't have been encouraged
in the religious life.

18:52.760 --> 18:56.310
I saw the way it was going, you know.

18:56.360 --> 18:59.670
I saw faith growing in you like...

18:59.720 --> 19:02.550
like some flower whose
name I'd never know.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.350
I didn't ask it to.

19:04.400 --> 19:07.110
There were times...
I didn't even want it.

19:07.160 --> 19:10.230
You came to a decision, Louise,

19:10.280 --> 19:12.830
and I respected that.

19:12.880 --> 19:17.520
It wasn't a decision, I was called
to do something and I did.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.950
Please don't call me Louise.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.630
What a nice lady your housekeeper is.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.910
She says she hasn't
any cinnamon toast,

19:26.960 --> 19:30.190
but if you sit tight, she'll
rustle up some drop scones.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.710
Mr Newgarden's very tired,

19:32.760 --> 19:37.230
I think we should take our leave
and let him have his tea at leisure.

19:37.280 --> 19:40.510
The scones won't be long, she's
already mixing the batter.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.510
Sorry.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.160
Don't be.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.160
Sister Julienne!

19:53.680 --> 19:56.350
My father says you haven't discussed
the matter of his legacy.

19:56.400 --> 19:57.840
No.

19:58.800 --> 20:03.270
But he is tired and very unwell and
I cannot take anything from him,

20:03.320 --> 20:06.150
least of all what strength
and energy he has.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.870
~ But, Sister...
~ You must go inside and sit with him.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.750
You need each other...

20:10.800 --> 20:13.200
not the company of strangers.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.520
How long has it been now?

20:23.880 --> 20:25.720
A little while.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.390
Every other time I see a midwife,

20:35.440 --> 20:38.670
her heart is beating like a drum!

20:38.720 --> 20:42.360
Every other day, she's kicking
up her heels like Fred Astaire!

20:43.440 --> 20:46.990
~ Please don't cry.
~ Something isn't right, nurse!

20:47.040 --> 20:48.870
I need to see a doctor.

20:48.920 --> 20:52.310
What you need is peace of mind.

20:52.360 --> 20:55.030
I'm going to telephone the surgery.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.150
'Fire, Police and Ambulance.
Which service do you require?'

21:17.200 --> 21:21.200
I can't get through to the
doctor, I need an ambulance.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.310
Thank you.

21:31.640 --> 21:34.560
~ Is that your bike?
~ Oh.

21:36.760 --> 21:40.160
I'm quite sure it will
be fine till we get back.

21:42.520 --> 21:45.030
It's a shame there's someone
in the front seat.

21:45.080 --> 21:47.620
You don't get so much of a view.

21:52.040 --> 21:55.950
Excuse me? I came in with Mrs
Bissette... the West Indian lady.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.350
Oh, yes. We had no trouble
locating the foetal heartbeat,

21:59.400 --> 22:02.870
but her BP's still raised so she's
been admitted for bed rest.

22:02.920 --> 22:05.550
She's worried her husband
won't know where she is.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.950
~ I'll tell him.
~ You're quite the guardian angel,

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
haven't you got anything else to do?

22:13.360 --> 22:17.070
Oh, I love my teddy so much!

22:37.920 --> 22:40.150
Your bicycle was brought back...

22:40.200 --> 22:42.150
by a black man.

22:42.200 --> 22:44.940
And you're wanted in the dining room.

22:47.240 --> 22:50.190
We thought he'd run
you over with his bus!

22:50.240 --> 22:54.470
And what's more, you're not a member
of the public. Dialling 999!

22:54.520 --> 22:57.950
Sister Evangelina's right, unless
a woman is in active labour,

22:58.000 --> 23:01.070
a doctor is always consulted
before transfer to hospital.

23:01.120 --> 23:04.430
If I may interject, that
is not a universal rule.

23:04.480 --> 23:07.190
~ Pass the sausage rolls please, Nurse Crane.
~ Gladly.

23:07.240 --> 23:09.110
And you needn't pass
them back my way,

23:09.160 --> 23:12.270
the smell of minced pork
is almost overwhelming.

23:12.320 --> 23:17.190
I suspect a phrenologist would
make much of your physiognomy.

23:17.240 --> 23:21.910
Your organ of alimentiveness
is unusually pronounced,

23:21.960 --> 23:26.710
which frequently results in
derangements of the appetites.

23:26.760 --> 23:28.070
Hmm.

23:28.120 --> 23:31.990
Your pinard technique
was probably at fault.

23:32.040 --> 23:34.470
After tea, you're to come
to the clinical room with me

23:34.520 --> 23:36.990
and I shall remind you
of the proper method.

23:37.040 --> 23:40.310
After tea, you are to go to the
clinical room with Nurse Franklin

23:40.360 --> 23:43.100
and she will remind you of the rules!

23:49.360 --> 23:52.630
~ You smell different.
~ They made me have a bath.

23:52.680 --> 23:56.950
I said, "I had one last night!
I got hot running water at home!"

23:57.000 --> 24:00.910
~ But there's no arguing in this place.
~ There's no arguing at home either,

24:00.960 --> 24:06.030
~ now they locked you up in here.
~ No jokes. I'm not in a joking mood.

24:06.080 --> 24:09.180
Keep smiling, girl, it's
good for the baby.

24:10.480 --> 24:14.200
Visiting time is over! All
visitors must now leave!

24:20.120 --> 24:23.390
I am relieved you've returned
from your excursion.

24:23.440 --> 24:26.230
I've just seen a rat in the bathroom.

24:26.280 --> 24:28.110
A whole one or just some droppings?

24:28.160 --> 24:31.630
There was a dropping, singular,
under the cork-topped stool.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.990
~ The culprit was gnawing the soap.
~ Your soap?
~ No!

24:35.040 --> 24:37.950
It was Camay, I only use Palmolive.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.830
These premises are
not fit for purpose!

24:41.880 --> 24:43.910
Oh, and I have a petrol receipt

24:43.960 --> 24:47.360
with a record of the mileage
I undertook today.

25:46.960 --> 25:49.390
Back into bed, please, Mrs Bissette.

25:49.440 --> 25:52.710
~ I was going to the bathroom.
~ You're a lady of leisure
while you're in here.

25:52.760 --> 25:55.150
Bed rest equals bed pans.

25:55.200 --> 25:58.800
~ Bed pans?
~ I'll fetch you one in a few minutes.

26:10.760 --> 26:14.270
Excuse me! Do you have
permission to be up here?

26:14.320 --> 26:17.950
Yes, I do. Patient attempted a
termination and needs to be questioned.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.870
They said it might still be alive!

26:19.920 --> 26:21.950
How the hell can it still be alive?!

26:22.000 --> 26:24.470
Patient should not be here.
This is an ante-natal ward!

26:24.520 --> 26:26.870
I'm not answering no
questions. I'm not!

26:26.920 --> 26:28.390
I've not done nothing wrong!

26:28.440 --> 26:31.470
Wheel her into this side room while
I fetch sister. You can wait out here.

26:31.520 --> 26:33.720
And, you, go back to bed!

26:50.680 --> 26:52.670
What's happened? What's happened?!

26:52.720 --> 26:54.660
Abigail?! Shh! Shh!

27:04.280 --> 27:08.070
Hmm. Your blood pressure's
still slightly raised.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.270
I don't want to go
back to the hospital.

27:10.320 --> 27:14.990
~ And I don't want her running through
the street in her nightdress again.
~ No, neither do I.

27:15.040 --> 27:17.910
You were booked in for
a hospital delivery.

27:17.960 --> 27:19.630
What happened?

27:19.680 --> 27:21.950
It was clean, it was efficient,

27:22.000 --> 27:25.910
it was everything I wanted
it to be... apart from safe.

27:25.960 --> 27:27.830
The London is excellent.

27:27.880 --> 27:31.350
I can promise you, neither you
nor your baby were in any danger.

27:31.400 --> 27:34.870
It didn't feel like that.
I didn't feel safe.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.990
Where do you feel safe?

27:39.360 --> 27:42.520
Here... in my home.

27:44.160 --> 27:47.470
I offered her a bed in the maternity
home but she wouldn't hear of it.

27:47.520 --> 27:50.430
She's saying that she wants
to give birth at home.

27:50.480 --> 27:52.990
If that's where she feels comfortable
that's what she must do.

27:53.040 --> 27:57.150
Home delivery for Mrs Bissette. I'll
put it straight in the Rolodex.

27:57.200 --> 28:00.750
No need, I'll adjust the log book. You
can put her on this morning's list.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.790
It really does look
wonderfully efficient.

28:02.840 --> 28:05.270
Meanwhile, what about the
patient's hypertension?

28:05.320 --> 28:07.310
I'm hopeful it might resolve.

28:07.360 --> 28:10.190
It could just be the stress
of an unsettling situation.

28:10.240 --> 28:13.740
I hope you're taking note
of this, Nurse Gilbert.

28:18.600 --> 28:21.800
Come along, old thing,
whistle a happy tune.

28:22.920 --> 28:25.110
I make too many mistakes, Patsy.

28:25.160 --> 28:27.470
Every day, I feel as
though I'm failing.

28:27.520 --> 28:29.150
Barbara, that's balderdash.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.750
Nursing isn't easy,

28:30.800 --> 28:32.990
that's why there are
rules and systems -

28:33.040 --> 28:35.590
things we can hide in and behind.

28:35.640 --> 28:39.070
Sometimes one simply has to dust
off one's brave face and crack on.

28:39.120 --> 28:42.150
~ Do you ever do that?
~ Has been known.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.790
I saw some shocking things
while I was on male surgical.

28:44.840 --> 28:48.360
Quite frankly, they're
best not dwelt on.

28:53.560 --> 28:56.280
Enter.

28:59.160 --> 29:02.550
Nest of brown rats underneath
the bath, sister.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.990
Couple of dead ones had
foam on their whiskers.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.630
I thought they were rabid until
Nurse Crane filled me in.

29:07.680 --> 29:09.510
Well, they're evidently hungry.

29:09.560 --> 29:12.150
Perhaps you should put some
poison down mixed with food.

29:12.200 --> 29:15.430
Arsenic on a bit of Cheddar,
no sooner said than done.

29:15.480 --> 29:18.430
~ Well, that's that, then.
~ I only wish it was.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.550
I went up in the loft
to check for nests

29:20.600 --> 29:22.790
and I could see daylight
through the roof tiles.

29:22.840 --> 29:24.830
All the lead's been
robbed off the roof.

29:24.880 --> 29:27.150
Which presumably explains
the leak on the landing.

29:27.200 --> 29:31.320
Not half! One more storm, we'll
be washed away like Jonah.

30:26.840 --> 30:29.470
Now, tonight, we're very
lucky to have with us a lady

30:29.520 --> 30:32.470
who's going to help us with our
display for the district jamboree.

30:32.520 --> 30:36.190
Can any of you tell me which
uniform Nurse Busby is wearing?

30:36.240 --> 30:38.510
~ Dog warden.
~ No!

30:38.560 --> 30:41.190
Nurse Busby works at The London
Hospital during the day

30:41.240 --> 30:44.910
and in the evenings she's a volunteer
with the St John Ambulance Brigade.

30:44.960 --> 30:48.430
So that means I know all about first aid
and what to do in the event of accidents.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.950
And, tonight, I'm going
to teach you about burns.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.830
We're meant to be doing
lighting fires.

30:52.880 --> 30:56.030
Both things are connected...
as you will see.

30:56.080 --> 30:59.270
The name of our new display is
When Lighting Fires Goes Wrong.

31:01.440 --> 31:05.310
Look, another fond relation asking
if we've chosen a china pattern.

31:05.360 --> 31:09.990
I really don't think it is too soon
to go to Selfridge's to pick one.

31:10.040 --> 31:14.230
Do have a look at Melrose, it's
got the prettiest gilded trim.

31:14.280 --> 31:18.150
Well, is it terribly expensive? I just
think we should think about other people.

31:18.200 --> 31:23.390
Tom, I spend every waking hour thinking
about other people and so do you!

31:23.440 --> 31:27.190
In fact, I strongly suspect we both
think about other people in our sleep.

31:27.240 --> 31:30.150
No-one's going to begrudge
us a few plates.

31:30.200 --> 31:32.670
Are you sure it'll be all right?

31:32.720 --> 31:35.230
Waltzing into a convent after dark

31:35.280 --> 31:38.190
with two haddock, chips
and marrowfat peas?

31:38.240 --> 31:41.550
Well, we can't possibly eat in the
street, we're wearing our uniforms.

31:43.440 --> 31:47.830
I just think that if we don't
arrange for a professional
photographer, we will regret it.

31:47.880 --> 31:51.470
This is a whole new chapter in our
lives and it's a very important one.

31:51.520 --> 31:56.070
Trixie, when you said yes to me,
you made me the happiest man alive.

31:56.120 --> 32:00.710
But I asked you to be my wife, not
some sort of professional fiance.

32:00.760 --> 32:04.270
I want to be married to you, I'm just
not that interested in being engaged!

32:04.320 --> 32:07.870
Well, I find that rather unfortunate, given
we've certain formalities to observe.

32:07.920 --> 32:10.270
Trixie, please, don't
bring up the party.

32:10.320 --> 32:14.310
If you move on from the dinner
service and the announcement and
the photographer to the party,

32:14.360 --> 32:15.950
I'm going to have to leave!

32:16.000 --> 32:19.670
We need to talk about the canapes,
Tom, and whether we're going to
have sherry or champagne.

32:19.720 --> 32:23.480
~ And if we want sherry, whether
we're going to order sweet or dry.
~ Ah, enough!

32:28.400 --> 32:33.430
~ Oh, dear. Do I hear someone stomping off?
~ It doesn't bode well, does it?

32:33.480 --> 32:35.710
Do you suppose we'll go to hell?

32:35.760 --> 32:38.270
Sitting eating our supper
in the house of God?

32:38.320 --> 32:41.520
Well, it's less of a crime
than eating in the street.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.240
Morning.

32:54.840 --> 33:00.110
~ Why have you put Nurse Gilbert up first?
~ Nurse Franklin delivered a baby
at two O'clock this morning.

33:00.160 --> 33:03.030
Meanwhile, Nurse Gilbert has
had her full eight hours.

33:03.080 --> 33:07.550
And I should know, I had to nudge her
out of bed with my slipper this morning.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.350
Is that true?

33:09.400 --> 33:11.670
Mark my words, the next
time that phone goes

33:11.720 --> 33:14.950
it's going to be young Myra
Wiggins at Quebec Street.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.510
I was out to her at midnight. Enema,
shave and chloral hydrate.

33:18.560 --> 33:23.910
She's only 16 and she will
need an experienced hand.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.870
If you're anticipating problems,

33:25.920 --> 33:29.510
she should be booked in at the
hospital or the maternity home.

33:29.560 --> 33:31.270
First summons of the day.

33:31.320 --> 33:34.920
~ And is it Myra Wiggins?
~ No, it's Abigail Bissette.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.390
So... go on.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.180
You go with her.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.400
Couldn't have been easier to find.

33:52.880 --> 33:56.230
Can I stay here? You won't
make me go to the hospital?

33:56.280 --> 33:59.030
I won't... and nor
will Nurse Gilbert.

33:59.080 --> 34:02.030
Doctor might breeze by
just to check you over,

34:02.080 --> 34:05.990
but, look, I'm unpacking all our kit,
so he'll know we've made our minds up.

34:11.120 --> 34:13.949
Come on, children, treasure
hunt in the garden.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.870
I wouldn't have come if I'd realised
it was someone's birthday.

34:17.920 --> 34:21.150
I have two daughters, a son
and eight grandchildren,

34:21.199 --> 34:23.670
it's always someone's birthday.

34:23.840 --> 34:26.270
I still feel as though I'm intruding.

34:26.320 --> 34:29.630
~ It's a family affair.
~ You're a family friend.

34:29.679 --> 34:32.030
We exchanged a Christmas
card each year.

34:32.080 --> 34:33.750
Through Muriel.

34:33.800 --> 34:36.139
You must miss her very much.

34:36.960 --> 34:40.030
There are times when it seems
she hasn't really gone.

34:40.080 --> 34:42.949
You know, I see her in
my daughters' faces.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.400
Anthony's too sometimes.

34:46.719 --> 34:49.510
It was yours... I couldn't picture.

34:49.560 --> 34:51.710
Until you came last week.

34:51.760 --> 34:53.909
I shouldn't have left in such haste,

34:53.960 --> 34:56.590
it was impolite after such
a generous invitation.

34:56.639 --> 35:02.510
It wasn't a generous invitation...
it was a selfish one.

35:02.560 --> 35:06.830
I... I could've just
written out a cheque.

35:06.880 --> 35:12.800
Like I wrote out a cheque for the Masonic
orphanage... and the village hall fund.

35:16.760 --> 35:18.900
But I wanted to see you.

35:20.280 --> 35:22.220
I wanted to see you.

35:29.320 --> 35:30.910
That's it, Abigail!

35:30.960 --> 35:34.150
That's it!

35:34.200 --> 35:35.990
Is the head born yet?

35:36.040 --> 35:37.390
Almost!

35:37.440 --> 35:40.940
You've been an absolute
trooper, you really have.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.110
Head's coming.

35:49.160 --> 35:51.310
Head's coming.

35:51.360 --> 35:54.550
~ Head's born!
~ Just take a breather, Abigail.

36:02.840 --> 36:06.030
Yes! Well done!

36:06.080 --> 36:08.030
Congratulations!

36:08.080 --> 36:10.270
Come along, birthday girl!

36:10.320 --> 36:12.150
It's a girl?

36:12.200 --> 36:13.940
Oh, it's a girl?

36:15.600 --> 36:17.150
Patsy...!

36:22.040 --> 36:24.230
~ Get the clamps, nurse?
~ We need to cut the cord.

36:24.280 --> 36:26.280
Why isn't she crying?

36:30.560 --> 36:32.670
Baby...

36:32.720 --> 36:36.150
Baby must've been very poorly
in the womb, Abigail.

36:36.200 --> 36:39.030
She hasn't been able
to breathe for us...

36:39.080 --> 36:42.070
cos I think her heart stopped
beating several days ago.

36:42.120 --> 36:44.190
But we heard it today!

36:45.040 --> 36:47.440
Nurse Gilbert heard it today!

36:54.400 --> 36:56.510
Barbara, look after Abigail.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.390
My baby!

37:00.520 --> 37:02.390
Come here.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.830
My baby!

37:13.120 --> 37:14.720
No!

37:21.240 --> 37:23.030
Is that my little dancer?

37:23.080 --> 37:25.620
Boy or girl? Don't tease me now.

37:32.280 --> 37:34.280
It was a little girl.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.160
I'm so sorry!

37:55.080 --> 37:58.070
I need you to telephone
Nonnatus House.

37:58.120 --> 38:00.750
Tell them we've had a child that...

38:00.800 --> 38:02.350
wasn't born living.

38:02.400 --> 38:06.720
I need a more senior midwife
to attend and the doctor too.

38:27.320 --> 38:30.260
I have mislaid the
rhythms of Morpheus.

38:31.320 --> 38:34.230
I am sentenced to pace the passages,

38:34.280 --> 38:38.230
my nights punctuated by a
bell that does not call me.

38:38.280 --> 38:41.910
It's called me... and I wish
to high heaven it hadn't.

38:41.960 --> 38:44.480
You are perturbed.

38:46.040 --> 38:49.440
You strive to hide it,
but you do not succeed...

38:55.480 --> 38:57.670
This pain won't last, Abigail.

38:57.720 --> 39:00.670
~ It won't last, I promise you.
~ It won't stop!

39:00.720 --> 39:02.550
I thought it would stop!

39:02.600 --> 39:04.910
~
~ May I come in?
~ Yes.

39:04.960 --> 39:07.870
She's in acute pain, Doctor.

39:07.920 --> 39:11.920
I'm concerned the placenta
may be trapped in the cervix.

39:17.040 --> 39:19.110
I need to examine her.

39:23.240 --> 39:24.480
Oh!

39:25.640 --> 39:28.430
What are you doing downstairs?
It's nearly midnight!

39:28.480 --> 39:34.280
I am invoking our patron, desirous
of His aid and consolation.

39:36.040 --> 39:39.310
Nurse Crane has the
practicalities in hand.

39:39.360 --> 39:42.790
What practicalities? What's happened?

39:45.480 --> 39:47.630
Undiagnosed twins.

39:47.680 --> 39:50.390
Did you hear that, Abigail?

39:50.440 --> 39:52.310
You have another baby.

39:52.360 --> 39:56.110
~ What?!
~ The reason you felt a change
of movement in the womb

39:56.160 --> 39:58.550
was because your first
little one passed away,

39:58.600 --> 40:01.870
but the second was still
alive and genuinely kicking.

40:03.160 --> 40:05.710
~ How long before it comes?
~ Already on its way.

40:05.760 --> 40:07.390
Get out a fresh set of kit.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.590
Use the ones in my bag.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.790
And then we'll need some hot water.

40:11.840 --> 40:15.150
~ I can't do it again!
~ Oh, yes, you can.

40:15.200 --> 40:17.630
Because we're going
to do this together.

40:17.680 --> 40:20.910
Hear that? Nobody argues
with Nurse Mount.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.990
This woman can do anything, Doctor.

40:23.040 --> 40:27.200
She's the strongest, bravest
mother I've ever seen.

40:48.920 --> 40:51.260
Is the doctor through there?

40:52.840 --> 40:54.880
You poor kid!

40:56.480 --> 40:58.790
First things first.

41:01.440 --> 41:03.510
Don't hurt the baby.

41:03.560 --> 41:06.310
You can hurt me, but
don't hurt the baby!

41:06.360 --> 41:10.670
Abigail, I'm not going to do anything at all
unless you're too tired to keep on pushing.

41:10.720 --> 41:13.110
We're here to help. That's all.

41:13.160 --> 41:15.560
You can trust us. You're safe.

41:17.760 --> 41:20.430
Has another midwife just arrived?

41:20.480 --> 41:22.270
She said her name was Nurse Crane.

41:22.320 --> 41:26.430
Oh, that's all you need, her galumphing
about in her great size nines.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.590
I'll send you out a cup of tea.

41:28.640 --> 41:31.310
~ Oh.
~ This is for you.

41:31.360 --> 41:35.470
It's been well sugared and
I want you to drink it all.

41:35.520 --> 41:38.240
There's been some... developments.

41:41.160 --> 41:44.070
That's the ticket! That's it!

41:44.120 --> 41:47.430
That's it! See, you
don't need my help.

41:59.640 --> 42:01.950
Hear that?

42:02.000 --> 42:03.870
Do you hear that?!

42:19.520 --> 42:21.920
Isn't that a beautiful sound?

42:23.960 --> 42:25.790
A little boy.

42:25.840 --> 42:28.310
~ Is he all right?
~ Very much so.

42:29.760 --> 42:31.120
Please.

42:43.760 --> 42:47.550
I expected one child and
I have one child in my arms.

42:47.600 --> 42:49.910
And another over there.

42:51.960 --> 42:55.060
I want to be glad, but...
I don't know how.

42:56.880 --> 42:59.080
Let him hold your finger.

43:03.720 --> 43:05.920
Let him know you're here.

43:15.040 --> 43:16.510
Come along, Nurse Gilbert.

43:16.560 --> 43:19.110
We've got a new mother
to take care of.

43:19.160 --> 43:22.200
And a baby... when
these men let it go.

43:24.440 --> 43:27.550
I'll go through and assist Nurse
Mount, if you're agreeable.

43:27.600 --> 43:30.350
It's never easy, is it?

43:30.400 --> 43:32.910
No.

43:32.960 --> 43:35.630
But we can show them how it's done.

43:50.760 --> 43:52.550
Hello, Sister.

43:52.600 --> 43:55.840
Shall I make a cup of tea?

43:57.000 --> 43:59.910
I saw the notes.

43:59.960 --> 44:04.950
Get the directory and find out which
Undertaker's on call for stillborns.

44:05.000 --> 44:08.200
This poor little thing
needs a resting place.

44:37.320 --> 44:39.200
Delia...

44:50.080 --> 44:51.600
Delia...

44:53.240 --> 44:55.030
Pats?

44:55.080 --> 44:57.910
I've only ever seen it once.

44:57.960 --> 44:59.830
In training.

44:59.880 --> 45:01.880
I had to take charge.

45:03.640 --> 45:07.510
~ I had to pretend.
~ Pretend what, Pats?

45:07.560 --> 45:11.190
That I was in control.

45:11.240 --> 45:13.550
I couldn't let them see.

45:13.600 --> 45:16.990
Oh, tell me, sweetheart.

45:17.040 --> 45:20.510
Tell me what happened...

45:48.360 --> 45:50.230
What time is it?

45:50.280 --> 45:53.520
~ Early enough.
~ No-one'll see me leave.

45:54.960 --> 45:57.360
No-one'll see anything at all.

46:04.680 --> 46:08.440
You seek to depart for
your surgery unnoticed.

46:10.240 --> 46:12.480
But you cannot outwit me.

46:13.400 --> 46:16.520
I might have known that
was too much to hope for.

46:23.760 --> 46:28.080
God speed, Sister.
There and back again.

46:46.720 --> 46:49.350
Nonnatus House, Sister
Julienne speaking.

46:49.400 --> 46:51.710
My father wants to take
you to the pictures.

46:51.760 --> 46:54.790
~ The pictures?
~ 'The cinema. The flicks.'

46:54.840 --> 46:59.070
On the strict understanding that
you don't stand him up again.

46:59.120 --> 47:02.280
We could make it a matinee,
if that would be persuasive?

47:09.400 --> 47:12.710
Morning, Abigail. We've just
come to do your routine checks.

47:12.760 --> 47:17.110
You'll have twice daily visits
from us for the rest of this week.

47:17.160 --> 47:20.160
Do you have a name
for Baby yet, Abigail?

47:21.560 --> 47:23.150
Terence Junior.

47:23.200 --> 47:27.440
He hasn't slept. We haven't slept.
It's like he's crying for two.

47:28.920 --> 47:31.320
And Abigail crying for us all.

47:37.480 --> 47:39.030
Father!>

47:39.080 --> 47:41.200
Come in.

47:44.640 --> 47:46.990
Oh, you mustn't tire yourself.

47:47.040 --> 47:50.680
It's a relief to be standing up,
as opposed to being stood up.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.720
Now, Anthony put a cushion
on it, because...

47:57.480 --> 47:59.750
Thank you.

47:59.800 --> 48:04.080
.. last time I was intending to take
you to the best seats in the house.

48:05.040 --> 48:08.750
There are also choc-ices
in the refrigerator,

48:08.800 --> 48:13.360
because I was intending to purchase
your favourite refreshments.

48:16.560 --> 48:19.300
I was intending all sorts of things.

48:20.640 --> 48:23.000
~ I'm sorry.
~ Don't be.

48:25.240 --> 48:28.800
You found a different happiness,
you know, and so did I.

48:30.040 --> 48:31.840
Yes.

48:34.160 --> 48:36.310
Louise...

48:36.360 --> 48:39.760
it hasn't hurt you to see
the road not travelled?

48:41.040 --> 48:44.510
No. It hasn't.

48:44.560 --> 48:49.270
Who's to say that we would have found
so much together as we did apart?

48:49.320 --> 48:51.440
Who, indeed?

48:59.880 --> 49:04.870
When I go, how do you
want to hear the news?

49:04.920 --> 49:06.990
I'm not sure I want to
hear the news at all.

49:07.040 --> 49:10.190
~ I could send Anthony.
~ No.

49:10.240 --> 49:13.790
The old-fashioned way will suffice.

49:13.840 --> 49:16.200
Just a letter.

50:10.480 --> 50:13.950
I feel afraid to love the baby I have

50:14.000 --> 50:17.600
and guilty I didn't know
the other was in trouble.

50:18.760 --> 50:23.790
How can I be a mother and not know
how many babies I was carrying?

50:23.840 --> 50:26.150
Abigail, I can't answer that.

50:26.200 --> 50:28.470
But neither can I sit here
and not say the thing

50:28.520 --> 50:30.790
that I believe most deeply.

50:32.080 --> 50:34.110
Which is, that God knew.

50:34.160 --> 50:37.790
Does God know how I will tell
this one about his sister?

50:37.840 --> 50:40.990
How I will say what she looked like?

50:41.040 --> 50:43.830
Who she might have been?

50:43.880 --> 50:45.950
I didn't even see her.

50:47.120 --> 50:49.270
Did you see her, Terence?

50:49.320 --> 50:52.760
I saw her foot. It looked so cold.

51:04.320 --> 51:07.390
The Church doesn't have
a single ritual for this.

51:07.440 --> 51:09.670
A stillborn baby can't
have a religious funeral,

51:09.720 --> 51:12.630
it can't have a grave of its
own. There's just nothing.

51:12.680 --> 51:15.710
~ There is prayer.
~ Private prayer.

51:15.760 --> 51:18.470
These parents need more than that.

51:18.520 --> 51:21.350
More than their baby being
buried in a public plot,

51:21.400 --> 51:23.790
tucked in a stranger's coffin.

51:23.840 --> 51:27.040
Sorry, Sister. There's
a letter for you here.

51:27.920 --> 51:30.070
They need something
to call their own.

51:30.120 --> 51:33.820
Something to make a memory
that they can file away.

51:35.520 --> 51:37.520
I agree.

51:40.800 --> 51:45.280
After all, what is love, if
it cannot be acknowledged?

51:50.000 --> 51:53.710
Who could I turn to, if not you?

51:53.760 --> 51:56.360
Who would console me, if not you?

51:57.120 --> 52:00.230
You don't need me to console you.

52:00.280 --> 52:04.950
The words are in here and you
know them in your heart as I do.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.950
The money he left us, will restore
the building to such good order

52:09.000 --> 52:12.480
our clinical certificate will
be renewed without question.

52:13.560 --> 52:17.470
We can carry on serving
the people who need us.

52:17.520 --> 52:20.110
Do you not believe that it was meant?

52:20.160 --> 52:24.070
That the chance you didn't
take was intended all along?

52:24.120 --> 52:26.200
I don't know.

52:27.480 --> 52:31.390
And I don't know how
to not know any more.

52:31.440 --> 52:35.080
I have so often had
to be the wise one.

52:36.560 --> 52:39.990
It's in here, Sister.

52:40.040 --> 52:42.840
Just as much for me as it is for you.

52:45.480 --> 52:50.400
"What? Do you wish to know your
Lord's meaning in this thing?

52:52.720 --> 52:55.230
"Know it well,

52:55.280 --> 52:57.800
"love was his meaning."

53:01.440 --> 53:05.910
Now, Sister Monica Joan's going to
help you by finishing this bootee

53:05.960 --> 53:09.630
and you and I are going to unpick
where this one's gone wrong

53:09.680 --> 53:12.790
and you can knit the
last few rows again.

53:12.840 --> 53:16.470
I was a different woman when
I started making these.

53:16.520 --> 53:19.990
I seem to recall it was
Mr Coleridge who opined,

53:20.040 --> 53:24.520
"A mother is a mother still,
The holiest thing alive."

53:26.160 --> 53:29.240
Well, he hit the nail on
the head there, didn't he?

53:30.280 --> 53:33.680
Then, I'm going to help you
concentrate on casting off.

53:36.960 --> 53:39.350
The Church doesn't
have a baptismal rite

53:39.400 --> 53:42.230
for babies who die without
drawing breath.

53:42.280 --> 53:44.950
But, in my view, we don't need one.

53:46.360 --> 53:50.510
In the book of Isaiah, there is a
beautiful verse in which God says,

53:50.560 --> 53:54.160
"I have called you by your
name, you are mine."

53:55.880 --> 54:00.550
But Terence and Abigail will think
of their little girl often,

54:00.600 --> 54:04.520
and if they are as wise and as
loving as I believe them to be...

54:06.120 --> 54:08.520
.. they will speak of her too.

54:09.560 --> 54:12.830
And for that reason
she will need a name

54:12.880 --> 54:15.950
and the name they have
chosen is April,

54:16.000 --> 54:20.200
after the month in which
she came to us and left.

54:24.240 --> 54:27.680
Her parents have brought something
very special with them today.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.880
Thank you.

54:43.320 --> 54:45.470
One of these shoes will
be taken to the undertaker

54:45.520 --> 54:47.830
who is looking after April.

54:47.880 --> 54:50.790
It will be placed on her foot

54:50.840 --> 54:54.040
as an emblem of the love
that goes with her.

54:54.640 --> 54:56.280
The other...

54:57.880 --> 55:00.620
.. will remain with Terence Junior...

55:02.480 --> 55:05.220
.. as a reminder of the twin he lost.

55:07.720 --> 55:09.990
When you're ready, Abigail.

55:17.640 --> 55:22.160
And may the Lord bless you
both and keep you both.

55:24.840 --> 55:28.340
And May the Lord make his
face to shine upon you.

55:40.440 --> 55:44.510
I'm happy to take it. I've already
spoken to the undertaker.

55:44.560 --> 55:46.400
Let me go.

55:49.440 --> 55:53.790
I've spent too much time looking
at you and seeing my fiance.

55:53.840 --> 55:57.190
Today, I looked at you
and saw the man I love.

55:57.240 --> 55:59.150
And I don't need a
party in a grand hotel

55:59.200 --> 56:02.140
to tell the world how
wonderful you are.

56:02.640 --> 56:05.680
I've a funny feeling that
the world already knows.
