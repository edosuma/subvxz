03:43.440 --> 03:45.840
Her name was Dorothy Sands.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.680
[Kathy Preston] She was abandoned
when she was eight years old

03:50.760 --> 03:53.440
by her own father after her mother died.

And then she was raised
by very strict Catholic grandparents.

My mother met my father,

04:46.960 --> 04:49.880
he was already much more established

04:49.960 --> 04:52.800
as a comedian
and a master of ceremonies and a musician.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.400
My mother was very attractive.

04:57.480 --> 04:59.680
[Preston] They ended up having an affair

04:59.760 --> 05:04.480
and then she ended up pregnant
with my brother Jim, who was born in 1953.

05:06.240 --> 05:11.440
After Jim was born, my brother Billy
was born on Valentine's Day of 1955.

05:12.240 --> 05:16.040
He was about a month old
and he stopped breathing.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.280
So, they rushed him to the hospital

05:18.360 --> 05:21.280
and it turned out
that he had a growth in his throat.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.360
When she handed him to the intern,

05:24.440 --> 05:28.440
the intern said,
"I'm sorry. He's already dead."

05:28.920 --> 05:31.760
And she screamed at the intern,

05:31.840 --> 05:34.800
"No, he's not! You have to do something!"

And so, they took him back

have trouble with depression.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.880
I… I hesitate to use schizophrenia

06:15.960 --> 06:19.240
because that was just
such the popular term of the time.

06:19.320 --> 06:21.720
His demons were, I think,

06:21.840 --> 06:25.000
his gambling habit,
his drinking, the drugs.

06:27.280 --> 06:31.400
He was incredibly jealous
of my mother, too.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.200
Talking to anybody or--

06:35.280 --> 06:37.840
and she was a very--
like I said, very attractive.

06:37.920 --> 06:39.480
A very, very pretty woman.

06:40.760 --> 06:43.920
My earliest memory of any trouble was

06:44.000 --> 06:47.280
I walked in,
I heard some noises in the bedroom,

06:47.840 --> 06:49.840
and my father was…

06:49.920 --> 06:51.520
I don't know if he was using his fist,

06:51.600 --> 06:53.600
but he was certainly hitting my mother.

06:53.680 --> 06:57.280
I didn't know
it was my mother until she sat up

06:57.360 --> 06:59.680
and she said, "Jimbo, everything's okay."

07:00.560 --> 07:02.880
"Mom's okay. Go ahead and leave."

07:04.920 --> 07:10.160
At some point, my mother decided
that he could no longer stay at the house

07:10.240 --> 07:13.600
because she felt
that he was dangerous to us,

07:13.680 --> 07:15.480
and she asked him to leave.

07:19.160 --> 07:24.720
It was one of the last times,
uh, that we saw our father.

07:26.640 --> 07:30.040
And it was shortly after that
that he committed suicide.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.560
It was early January.

07:34.320 --> 07:38.840
[Preston] He did commit suicide
at a hotel where he was staying.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.440
[Morrison]
And basically asphyxiated himself.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.120
And there was a suicide note,

07:46.200 --> 07:51.160
and in the suicide note,
he alluded to the fact

07:51.240 --> 07:55.080
that my mother was driving him crazy.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.040
I didn't know that until many years later.

08:02.760 --> 08:07.640
I had, uh, been told he had had problems

08:07.720 --> 08:11.400
that had contributed to his poor health

08:11.480 --> 08:13.640
and died of a cerebral hemorrhage

08:13.720 --> 08:15.680
is what she told us when we were younger,

08:15.800 --> 08:17.680
and I didn't really know what that meant.

08:17.760 --> 08:22.080
But that was how
it was left with us as children.

08:22.160 --> 08:23.640
It was what we were told.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.760
When we left,
we moved back to Amanda, Ohio

08:27.840 --> 08:30.960
and we stayed on the farm
that my mother grew up on.

08:32.480 --> 08:36.080
[Preston] I remember playing
outside in the yard with the boys.

08:36.160 --> 08:38.800
Billy had a wonderful sense of humor.

08:39.800 --> 08:44.360
[Morrison] He was not as outgoing, maybe,
as Kathy and I were with our friends.

08:49.600 --> 08:53.080
Billy was lonely. Billy didn't
play in groups when we were around.

08:53.160 --> 08:56.600
When we were down
playing team-type sports,

08:56.680 --> 08:57.960
like kickball and stuff,

08:58.040 --> 09:00.200
he didn't seem like he participated.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.200
I don't know if he wasn't allowed,

09:02.280 --> 09:04.240
or if he was busy doing something else,

09:04.320 --> 09:08.040
but he wasn't out with
the group of kids it didn't seem like.

09:12.640 --> 09:16.000
He was remarkably close
to his sister Kathy.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.600
They had a great bond.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.040
I can remember thinking
how wonderful it was

09:20.120 --> 09:22.160
to be that close to your siblings.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.120
[Preston]
Billy and I played together a lot.

09:24.200 --> 09:27.040
There's an age of almost
five years between Jim and I,

09:27.120 --> 09:30.240
so he probably had
less patience for me, you know,

09:30.320 --> 09:32.640
but Billy and I played together often.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.240
[Morrison] We laughed, we played,
we had a great time.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.800
I never had any…

09:40.360 --> 09:42.600
any reason to think he was any different.

09:48.960 --> 09:52.760
[Preston] My mother came back
to Ohio, I think, for a couple reasons.

09:52.840 --> 09:56.600
She couldn't
manage financially by herself.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.440
She needed a man in her life.

10:00.120 --> 10:01.560
When we got to Ohio,

10:02.120 --> 10:04.200
I remember Dick Jonas
coming into our life.

10:05.080 --> 10:08.520
[Preston] And he was willing
to take her back with her three children

10:09.080 --> 10:12.360
in Circleville on Pontius Lane,
close to Amanda.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.840
You have to remember, this is the 60s.

10:17.920 --> 10:21.520
It was very difficult
for her as a single parent.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.760
And so she remarried right away.

10:24.960 --> 10:27.960
He was a truck driver
and had the language of a truck driver

10:28.040 --> 10:29.320
and drank a lot.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.880
And the marriage
went south pretty quickly.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.480
[crossing bell ringing]

10:36.360 --> 10:38.200
[Preston] After that marriage dissolved,

10:38.280 --> 10:41.840
she took a job in Circleville
at the DuPont Factory.

10:42.640 --> 10:45.760
And she decided she also
still wanted to go back and sing.

10:45.840 --> 10:47.800
And so she would come up here to Columbus

10:47.880 --> 10:50.840
at the Clock Restaurant
and other nightclubs up here.

10:51.240 --> 10:54.080
And that's where Chalmer
comes into the picture.

10:58.680 --> 11:02.240
Chalmer was, when she first met him, um…

11:02.880 --> 11:03.880
charming.

11:04.480 --> 11:07.880
He was very, um,
interesting at the beginning.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.640
He seemed like a very nice man.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.920
He had a daughter.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.040
He was very protective of his daughter.

11:14.120 --> 11:15.840
His daughter's name was Challa.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.560
So when they married,

11:17.640 --> 11:22.680
Challa was the same age
as Billy just by a few months

11:22.760 --> 11:26.360
and so they decided
to adopt each other's kids.

11:26.440 --> 11:29.320
We didn't have
any choice in that… obviously.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.040
It wasn't even presented to us
as an option.

11:32.120 --> 11:36.160
Chalmer officially
adopted Billy, Jim and I.

11:36.240 --> 11:38.720
And Mom officially adopted Challa.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.760
So, that's how
we became the Milligan family.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.560
[Morrison]
He seemed to care a lot for my mother.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.080
He seemed to care a lot for us kids,

11:50.160 --> 11:53.920
but he became very controlling very quick.

11:54.640 --> 11:57.480
She thought was a pretty decent guy.
She married him.

11:57.560 --> 12:00.760
He was going to support the family,
father her children.

12:00.840 --> 12:05.600
She had great hopes in him
and then he instantly became a nightmare.

12:09.640 --> 12:15.040
I remember once
there was a very violent argument

12:15.120 --> 12:19.040
about the fact
that she was seen at work by him.

12:19.560 --> 12:21.720
She was talking to a Black man.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.200
And he's screaming
and he gets on top of her

12:24.280 --> 12:27.720
and he's banging her head on the tile.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.240
And we're… we're standing in the hallway

12:30.320 --> 12:33.360
and he looks over and
he screams at us to go to the bedrooms.

12:33.440 --> 12:34.560
Billy was…

12:36.000 --> 12:38.080
He was not there.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.600
I mean he was there, but he was not there.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.920
And he was in a kind of a hunched position

12:47.000 --> 12:48.720
and he was buzzing.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.880
I call it buzzing. He's… [buzzes]

12:51.960 --> 12:53.480
And he had this little character.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.840
He called himself "Little Bee."

12:55.920 --> 12:58.840
"But everything's gonna be all right.
Don't worry. It's gonna be all right."

12:58.920 --> 13:00.680
"It's gonna be all right," she would say.

13:01.160 --> 13:03.200
And I was like, "Okay."

13:03.280 --> 13:04.600
You know, I was seven.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.480
[with British accent]
He doesn't even remember.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.920
[Harding]
Billy doesn't remember his mother?

13:15.120 --> 13:16.600
Not as he is now.

13:17.680 --> 13:22.640
He remembers his mother
sprawled on the floor bleeding.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.160
That's how he remembers his mother.

13:27.160 --> 13:31.040
It now turned from slapping,
to actually punching,

13:31.120 --> 13:35.080
to dragging my mother around by her hair.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.200
Um, it just continued to escalate.

13:39.200 --> 13:42.600
[Lansing] He hung out at the bar
night after night after night.

13:42.680 --> 13:46.480
[Morrison] I don't think he ever passed
The Dog House without stopping, ever.

13:47.040 --> 13:48.480
Going or coming.

13:48.560 --> 13:51.680
And if he was drinking
and he continued home and drank some more,

13:51.760 --> 13:54.800
it was almost a guarantee
it was going to be a violent night.

13:55.360 --> 13:58.920
We would know when he was coming home
because his truck was real loud.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.800
And you could hear him coming up
around the corner to go home,

14:02.880 --> 14:05.840
and he woke everybody
in the neighborhood up with his truck.

14:06.440 --> 14:10.800
You train your brain to know
the difference in how he's driving,

14:10.880 --> 14:13.280
how he flips the light switch on,

14:13.360 --> 14:16.680
what kind of mood can you read
from upstairs in the dark

14:16.760 --> 14:19.080
to know whether or not,

14:19.160 --> 14:23.560
is he going to go to bed or is he going
to just sit there for a few moments?

14:23.640 --> 14:25.920
Or is he going to come
and jerk you out of bed

14:26.000 --> 14:27.640
and beat you for something stupid?

14:28.560 --> 14:29.840
He was, uh…

14:31.320 --> 14:33.480
kind of like a Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde.

14:33.560 --> 14:34.800
You just never knew.

14:34.880 --> 14:38.800
And so, um, when he would explode,

14:38.880 --> 14:40.760
usually there was no one around.

14:44.120 --> 14:46.920
[Billy on tape]
I remember when I was at home,

14:47.280 --> 14:50.760
I lost all respect for police authority.

14:50.840 --> 14:53.360
When the police were called to my house,

14:53.440 --> 14:57.360
my stepfather had
beaten my mother mercilessly,

14:57.440 --> 15:00.520
and I mean she had blood all over her
and her hair was ripped out.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.280
And there were two officers in the house

15:03.360 --> 15:05.600
and I was yelling at this officer.

15:05.680 --> 15:08.040
I said, "Look what he did to my mother!"

15:08.120 --> 15:10.080
I said, "Why don't you
take him out of here

15:10.160 --> 15:11.480
so he doesn't hurt anybody?"

15:11.560 --> 15:13.520
And the officer
looked down at me and said,

15:13.600 --> 15:15.240
"Well, if she'd be a better wife,

15:15.320 --> 15:17.640
she wouldn't get
knocked around now, would she?"

15:17.720 --> 15:18.560
[ironic chuckle]

15:20.960 --> 15:24.640
The punching on Billy and I
happened someplace else.

15:25.280 --> 15:26.840
Never in the house.

15:27.880 --> 15:30.400
There was a garage
that they built behind the house

15:30.480 --> 15:33.080
and behind that garage was a room.

15:33.160 --> 15:36.760
That's where Chalmer
would beat on Billy and me.

15:37.280 --> 15:40.280
He would use a phone book

15:40.360 --> 15:42.160
or something thick

15:42.240 --> 15:45.480
that he could put up against
our chest or the side of our head

15:45.560 --> 15:47.120
and that's what he would hit.

15:47.200 --> 15:50.160
It would not leave a mark,
it would not draw blood,

15:50.240 --> 15:52.080
but it would sure stun you.

15:52.600 --> 15:53.720
It would hurt.

15:54.240 --> 15:55.320
Then he would say,

15:55.400 --> 15:58.320
"If you talk to your mother
or your sisters about this

15:58.400 --> 16:00.760
then they're gonna suffer for it as well."

16:03.240 --> 16:05.640
There was a lot of violence in this house.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.960
A lot of violence.

16:08.040 --> 16:10.880
And Billy was subject
to a lot of that violence.

16:12.040 --> 16:15.200
Along with seeing me subject,
the other children saw it.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.160
But Billy, the core Billy,

16:18.640 --> 16:21.480
is very tender and very sweet.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.440
Wouldn't hurt anybody.

16:23.520 --> 16:26.240
He took on him my pain.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.880
He was a horrible abusive man,

16:32.480 --> 16:37.320
but it was like Billy was his target.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.360
[Chalmer] It was hard
to get anything done out of him.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.680
He wouldn't do anything he was asked.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.040
So…

16:49.160 --> 16:52.200
it was just a big hassle all the time.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.600
Chalmer hated Billy,
it felt like, all the time.

16:56.680 --> 16:58.120
This was, um…

16:59.160 --> 17:02.080
Chalmer seemed to go out of his way

17:02.160 --> 17:04.920
to make his life miserable.

17:06.600 --> 17:11.320
[Morrison] I think it affected Billy
more than me or my sister.

17:12.160 --> 17:15.880
He picked on him, every little thing.

17:16.440 --> 17:17.400
Everything.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.800
Billy didn't do anything right.

17:20.400 --> 17:25.640
She helplessly watched him
abuse all of his children

17:25.720 --> 17:27.360
and torture Billy for years.

17:28.200 --> 17:31.440
No one even questioned
why she tolerated that.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.800
Maybe 30 years later,

17:33.880 --> 17:37.800
I would have wanted to ask her
why she allowed that,

17:38.320 --> 17:42.960
but I almost wouldn't
have had to ask her because I know.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.840
Where we were raised
and how we were raised

17:46.920 --> 17:50.440
was that you needed
a father for your children.

17:50.520 --> 17:53.960
You needed someone
who would work and support your family

17:54.040 --> 17:57.240
and you did
whatever it took to make that happen.

17:58.080 --> 18:04.040
And no one just questioned
why or how she chose this man,

18:05.000 --> 18:09.520
and why or how he ended up staying there
long enough to cause this kind of damage.

18:20.760 --> 18:23.160
[Morrison]
We lived on Pontius Lane in Circleville.

18:23.240 --> 18:25.360
We moved to Spring Street
in Lancaster, Ohio.

18:32.440 --> 18:35.600
Chalmer's father
owned a farm in Bremen, Ohio.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.120
Eighty-eight acres.

18:38.200 --> 18:42.040
I think it became a place where Chalmer

18:42.120 --> 18:46.520
could reprimand, punish, and discipline us

18:46.600 --> 18:49.600
more than he could
probably around the house.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.440
But I could tell that things never…

18:53.520 --> 18:56.800
Things never went right at the farm,
especially if he went alone.

18:57.240 --> 18:59.240
[static buzzing]

19:02.360 --> 19:04.240
Does he know I'm here?

19:04.320 --> 19:05.880
[Harding] You're talking about…

19:08.640 --> 19:09.640
My dad.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.760
[Preston] When Billy was at Harding

19:18.840 --> 19:23.240
is when he started to actually
talk about what was going on in the barn.

19:23.800 --> 19:27.040
I know that he used to go there,
used to take the children there,

19:27.840 --> 19:34.640
and that a lot of abuse
towards Billy happened in that barn.

19:36.320 --> 19:38.600
If I did something wrong,
he's going to kill me.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.600
[Harding] If you did something wrong,
he's going to kill you?

19:43.200 --> 19:46.040
Like what? What kind
of wrong things do you mean?

19:47.280 --> 19:49.320
I'm not supposed to tell things.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.160
He didn't like little boys.

19:52.680 --> 19:54.680
[Harding] Was he afraid of little boys?

19:55.320 --> 19:57.520
No, he always hurt little boys.

20:04.840 --> 20:09.480
One day we were outside playing,
we could hear some crying and screaming.

20:09.560 --> 20:12.520
We sat on the bank
along the road for a while.

20:12.600 --> 20:17.480
And then finally we got enough nerve
that we went over toward the barn

20:17.560 --> 20:19.840
because that's where
the noise was coming from.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.320
Billy was tied up.

20:22.880 --> 20:25.160
He had his hands behind his back

20:25.240 --> 20:27.520
and he had his shirt unbuttoned

20:27.600 --> 20:29.200
and he was crying.

20:30.960 --> 20:35.320
And then he came out
and he raised his shirt up in the air

20:35.400 --> 20:38.000
and hit the ground with it
and he was really mad

20:38.080 --> 20:39.680
and then he walked away.

20:42.920 --> 20:46.520
The only person that was
there with him that day was Chalmer.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.720
I can still hear him crying.

20:58.040 --> 21:01.080
[Milligan] I was, uh… beat around.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.240
I got tied up and different things.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.120
Billy's asleep.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.920
[Harding]
What was it that made him go to sleep?

21:33.520 --> 21:36.280
I think it's making him
remember too much stuff.

21:38.080 --> 21:41.880
I felt upset that I didn't say something

21:41.960 --> 21:43.680
and go to the police.

21:44.520 --> 21:47.640
Then Chalmer wouldn't have got away
with saying he didn't do anything

21:47.720 --> 21:50.640
when I know he had
to have done something to him.

21:51.240 --> 21:52.160
So…

21:56.040 --> 21:57.360
[sobs]

22:06.800 --> 22:09.720
You don't have words
for that kind of stuff.

22:12.280 --> 22:15.840
They don't have words for…
for rape and sodomy.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.680
They don't… they don't have those words.

22:17.760 --> 22:19.080
They don't have the vocabulary.

22:25.800 --> 22:30.400
He talked about being raped three times

22:30.480 --> 22:31.960
or four times.

22:33.480 --> 22:39.000
And he related being forced
to dig a grave and lay in that grave,

22:39.080 --> 22:45.800
and having a metal pipe
put over his face with an opening.

22:45.880 --> 22:50.880
And having the grave filled in
so he was almost buried alive,

22:50.960 --> 22:57.080
and having Chalmers
urinate down the opening of the pipe

22:57.160 --> 22:58.400
onto his face.

23:06.840 --> 23:11.720
David is the one who remembers
only the pain of the abuses

23:11.800 --> 23:12.720
and the abuses,

23:12.800 --> 23:15.920
the beatings and the sexual abuses.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.520
And being tied up
in uncomfortable positions

23:18.640 --> 23:22.600
and being threatened with being killed
and buried in the barn and so on.

23:22.680 --> 23:25.360
He remembers all of this with terror.

23:27.880 --> 23:31.480
I would say that multiple personality
is both a shield and an escape.

23:31.600 --> 23:35.840
So, it protects you, because one part
cannot remember the abuse,

23:35.920 --> 23:37.320
which is an escape.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.440
But the escape is the shield.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.320
It's a disorder
that starts very early in life

23:48.400 --> 23:51.360
when the child is putting together
a sense of self.

23:51.440 --> 23:54.560
So, if you're a child,
you can't fight back,

23:54.640 --> 23:56.320
you can't run away.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.400
So, you go away in your mind.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.400
Children are born
with the potential to be multiple

24:01.480 --> 24:05.760
and it is the quality of the parenting
and the early experiences

24:05.840 --> 24:07.920
that either integrate that personality

24:08.000 --> 24:11.200
or lead to
the fragmentation of the personality.

24:13.640 --> 24:16.760
[Ross] Typically in DID,
there's very distinct parts

24:16.840 --> 24:18.360
with very distinct roles.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.600
This part does that,
this part has this age.

24:20.680 --> 24:25.520
So, there can be a very
large degree of structure and order,

24:25.600 --> 24:28.360
and also a large degree
of chaos at the same time.

24:28.440 --> 24:31.280
And when you grow up
in these very dysfunctional families,

24:31.360 --> 24:32.960
you learn how to be dysfunctional.

24:37.760 --> 24:40.280
The accusations he's put on me…

24:40.360 --> 24:43.560
It would have come out
a long, long time ago were they true.

24:44.880 --> 24:46.400
That's how I feel about it.

24:49.760 --> 24:52.600
[Billy] For many years,
I lived with a constant guilt.

24:52.680 --> 24:54.960
I mean, I beat my head in the wall.

24:55.520 --> 24:58.800
Um, I've done… I've attempted suicide.

24:59.360 --> 25:03.840
I lived with so much guilt
that I just wanted to die.

25:04.480 --> 25:06.600
[Preston] He just got
to a point where he couldn't…

25:06.680 --> 25:09.840
Uh, he just couldn't
stand Chalmer anymore.

25:09.920 --> 25:11.720
He was just tired of living in…

25:11.800 --> 25:16.000
in the fear and the trauma
of that existence.

25:16.080 --> 25:19.600
You mean they put me to sleep
when I try to kill myself?

25:21.960 --> 25:25.480
[Harding] I think that
could be a time when they would feel

25:25.560 --> 25:29.520
that you weren't
able to deal with the issue.

25:29.600 --> 25:33.640
Have you felt sometimes
that you just didn't know what else to do?

25:34.160 --> 25:35.040
Yeah.

25:35.120 --> 25:37.800
[Harding]
That's a pretty drastic thing to do.

25:40.680 --> 25:44.240
Well, I didn't think
nobody'd ever be able to help.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.480
Billy had made a plan.

25:47.560 --> 25:49.600
Uh, he was 14 or 15.

25:50.480 --> 25:53.120
He totally planned on killing Chalmer.

25:56.600 --> 25:58.640
He was going to stab him in his sleep.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.400
And he talked to me about this.

26:00.480 --> 26:03.920
And then the next morning,
I said, "What happened?"

26:04.000 --> 26:05.480
I mean, I was like… [sighs]

26:05.560 --> 26:07.840
"We talked about this.
You were going to do this.

26:07.920 --> 26:10.360
What happened? You were
going to kill him." You know?

26:11.080 --> 26:13.800
He said, "What are you talking about?"

26:13.880 --> 26:16.600
I said, "You were going to kill Chalmer."

26:16.680 --> 26:19.920
"You were going to kill him.
You were going to kill him in his sleep."

26:20.000 --> 26:21.040
And he's like…

26:22.720 --> 26:24.680
"No! I would never do that."

26:24.760 --> 26:28.720
And I'm like, "What? You planned it.
The knife is still under your pillow!"

26:28.800 --> 26:29.800
You know?

26:30.400 --> 26:32.400
He had no recollection at all

26:32.480 --> 26:34.720
of the conversation we had
the day prior to that.

26:36.120 --> 26:37.240
Is he dead?

26:38.240 --> 26:39.400
Is who dead?

26:43.200 --> 26:44.640
I don't know that he's dead,

26:44.720 --> 26:48.440
but I think your mother divorced him,

26:48.520 --> 26:50.000
so he's out of your life.

26:51.520 --> 26:54.120
[Preston] There was still
violence all the way till Chalmer left.

26:54.200 --> 26:58.280
There was still violence clear through
till the time Billy was big enough

26:58.360 --> 27:00.320
to try to start to fight back.

27:01.360 --> 27:03.280
I… I was about 16 years old.

27:03.960 --> 27:05.560
We were, uh, having dinner.

27:06.440 --> 27:10.040
All I remember was like a flash.

27:10.120 --> 27:12.680
And they were yelling
and they were screaming.

27:12.760 --> 27:15.000
Chalmer had stood up,
reached in front of me,

27:15.080 --> 27:18.200
grabs my brother sitting to my right,

27:18.280 --> 27:20.960
and dragged him
across the table in front of me

27:21.040 --> 27:22.760
and threw him across the room.

27:23.840 --> 27:25.840
And started choking him,

27:27.080 --> 27:28.760
physically choking him,

27:28.840 --> 27:30.440
and he couldn't get his breath.

27:30.520 --> 27:32.200
And I, um…

27:33.680 --> 27:37.400
I don't know what happened.
I ran over and I grabbed him.

27:37.480 --> 27:38.640
And… and he kind of stood up

27:38.720 --> 27:41.320
and I turned him and
I slammed him against the 'frigerator

27:41.840 --> 27:44.760
and I saw the knives on the counter…

27:46.160 --> 27:47.160
and I…

27:54.360 --> 27:55.840
I picked up one of the knives

27:56.840 --> 27:57.760
and, uh…

28:00.600 --> 28:03.520
I grabbed him by his right shoulder

28:03.600 --> 28:05.560
and I put the knife up against his neck.

28:06.120 --> 28:07.760
And he kind of stood up

28:07.840 --> 28:10.080
and he looked at me, unbelieving,

28:10.160 --> 28:11.680
not knowing what was going on.

28:12.520 --> 28:16.240
And I walked him
with that knife point right to his neck.

28:16.840 --> 28:18.800
I walked him straight to the back door…

28:20.680 --> 28:23.760
I pushed him
against the door and I said, "Get out."

28:23.840 --> 28:26.120
"If you come back in this house,

28:26.200 --> 28:28.520
I promise you I will kill you."

28:29.400 --> 28:31.360
He did not come back that night.

28:31.440 --> 28:33.440
I think that was
the end of the relationship

28:33.520 --> 28:36.400
in terms of the household
and everything and, um…

28:38.080 --> 28:40.600
that was probably
the most traumatic event.

28:44.160 --> 28:46.160
You mean he really can't hurt me anymore?

28:46.240 --> 28:48.160
That's right. He can't hurt you anymore.

29:10.280 --> 29:12.320
Before he was an adult,

29:12.400 --> 29:16.680
as his behavior started to escalate
more toward a criminal aspect,

29:16.760 --> 29:19.840
he started doing some drugs,
some mild drugs, pot and smoking.

29:20.360 --> 29:22.200
[Lynn] It was the 70s.

29:22.280 --> 29:24.240
The season of drugs,
sex, and rock and roll,

29:24.320 --> 29:26.320
I guess is what they called it.

29:37.440 --> 29:40.960
I was never ever aware
of Billy doing anything criminal

29:41.040 --> 29:42.960
when we were running around together.

29:43.040 --> 29:46.160
If he did,
I was completely oblivious to it.

29:47.040 --> 29:50.240
He clearly was
going down a path, it looked like,

29:50.320 --> 29:52.360
in little petty criminal aspects,

29:52.440 --> 29:56.160
but he seemed to not really
understand what was the big deal.

29:57.200 --> 29:59.920
I do things and I don't remember them.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.640
'cause I'm asleep.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.720
People tell me I do things…

30:08.000 --> 30:08.960
bad things.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.760
[Preston] So, yes, it got worse.

30:16.840 --> 30:17.680
[car horn honks]

30:18.600 --> 30:23.680
In 1972, he was
arrested in Circleville, Ohio

30:24.280 --> 30:27.240
for, um, an alleged kidnapping and rape.

30:27.840 --> 30:30.800
He and a friend picked up a couple girls.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.360
They were gonna go out drinking.

30:32.440 --> 30:36.160
The other guy went off
with one of the girls and they had sex,

30:36.760 --> 30:39.760
but he told me,
"All we were doing was drinking.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.920
I wouldn't… I wouldn't do that."

30:50.160 --> 30:53.120
People would say you've done
these things that he didn't remember.

30:55.080 --> 30:57.640
[Harding] What kind of things
do they tell you that you do?

31:02.240 --> 31:03.720
Criminal stuff.

31:05.440 --> 31:09.040
[Preston] His body did,
but he had no recollection of doing.

31:11.040 --> 31:14.560
I guess every time I wake up,
somebody says I did something bad.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.440
[Preston] In the Ohio area,

31:22.520 --> 31:25.240
there were several roadside rests
where gays would meet

31:25.320 --> 31:29.200
and it was
a real easy place to go rob people,

31:29.280 --> 31:30.680
because there they were,

31:30.760 --> 31:32.960
and they didn't want
to be found out either.

31:33.040 --> 31:35.080
He needed money to pay his rent

31:35.160 --> 31:38.280
or to supply his need
for drugs or alcohol.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.560
How… How can I not know that other side?

31:53.120 --> 31:54.600
Another side of me.

31:56.040 --> 31:58.800
[Preston]
Then shortly after that, in 1975,

31:58.880 --> 32:03.120
he was arrested and charged
with robbing the Gray Drugstore.

32:03.200 --> 32:05.720
[suspenseful music playing]

32:18.800 --> 32:20.720
[Preston] His lawyer plea bargained him.

32:25.840 --> 32:28.400
His plea bargain
gave him a lesser sentence

32:28.480 --> 32:30.320
and that's when he went to Lebanon.

32:36.200 --> 32:40.320
He was there from 1975 to 1977.

32:45.560 --> 32:46.840
He was mentally ill.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.440
He wasn't getting any treatment.

32:51.520 --> 32:56.640
He just existed as a prisoner there
like anyone else and he ate…

32:59.520 --> 33:01.640
When Billy got out of Lebanon, he was--

33:02.320 --> 33:04.120
Well, I remember the day we picked him up.

33:04.200 --> 33:05.720
He was very happy. [laughs]

33:05.800 --> 33:07.240
He was in a very good mood.

33:07.320 --> 33:10.080
He was excited to get out.

33:10.800 --> 33:15.480
And I think
he really, really was trying for a while.

33:15.560 --> 33:18.920
But I think it was too hard
because he could not manage

33:19.000 --> 33:21.960
living a life that he
didn't know how to live,

33:22.040 --> 33:24.160
and didn't have the skills to live.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.320
Why am I that way?

33:29.880 --> 33:33.480
That's when I also started to realize
when things were going wrong.

33:33.560 --> 33:35.560
[crows cawing]

33:37.240 --> 33:38.760
With Billy, um…

33:38.840 --> 33:41.600
we have this intuition between each other.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.880
I know how he behaves

33:43.960 --> 33:45.680
and I know in…

33:45.760 --> 33:48.320
I know in my mind that something's wrong.

33:49.800 --> 33:51.200
I just knew.

33:52.320 --> 33:54.240
[Tom Brokaw]
Police in Columbus arrested Milligan.

33:54.320 --> 33:56.600
A 23-year-old Columbus, Ohio man--

33:56.680 --> 34:01.360
…charged with sexual assaults on four
women in the Ohio State University area.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.400
He was the infamous "campus rapist."

34:10.240 --> 34:12.960
Having read Dr. Harding's reports,

34:13.040 --> 34:19.120
I have no doubt that his past criminal
and mental health history,

34:19.200 --> 34:21.400
throughout a great portion of his life,

34:21.480 --> 34:23.360
had a great deal of bearing.

34:23.440 --> 34:27.080
We, of course, began to carefully, uh…

34:27.680 --> 34:32.240
evaluate the, uh, alters…

34:33.160 --> 34:39.400
that, uh, were a part
of the symptomatology that he exhibited.

34:40.680 --> 34:42.080
What was happening

34:42.720 --> 34:46.160
during the time immediately preceding

34:46.760 --> 34:48.720
the events in October?

34:49.480 --> 34:51.200
[with a drawl]
I don't remember a whole lot.

34:51.800 --> 34:55.400
Memory was very distorted

34:55.480 --> 34:57.880
and memory was very fragmented,

34:57.960 --> 34:59.960
as well as the personalities.

35:00.720 --> 35:03.680
People were getting knocked off the spot.

35:05.080 --> 35:06.600
And nobody knew why.

35:07.480 --> 35:11.160
And Ragen started meeting bad people.

35:11.240 --> 35:12.360
He started…

35:13.960 --> 35:16.200
taking speed and drinking.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.560
"On the spot."

35:17.640 --> 35:19.360
That was the term they--

35:19.960 --> 35:25.160
He would say that
whoever it was that was talking to me

35:25.240 --> 35:27.480
was quotes "on the spot."

35:28.960 --> 35:32.520
Last summer in July and August
and September and so on,

35:32.600 --> 35:37.080
were you aware of things
being mixed up during that time?

35:37.160 --> 35:39.360
Were you on the spot part of the time?

35:39.440 --> 35:42.800
[with Yugoslavian accent] Parts of
the time, I was on the spot. I will…

35:42.880 --> 35:46.680
[Harding] When did you begin
to plan to go out and get money?

35:48.040 --> 35:50.080
[Milligan as Ragen]
After the last job was lost.

35:51.080 --> 35:54.200
[Harding]
And how did you select the women?

35:56.000 --> 35:58.520
[Milligan as Ragen]
They were just there, in place.

35:59.560 --> 36:01.880
But I don't remember so much,

36:01.960 --> 36:04.080
Adalana was stealing time.

36:05.240 --> 36:06.720
I don't like her very well.

36:07.480 --> 36:08.520
[Wilbur] Why?

36:09.560 --> 36:13.800
Well, you know, she just does weird stuff.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.680
[Wilbur] What kind of weird stuff?

36:15.760 --> 36:17.160
She likes girls.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.360
[Wilbur] Mm-hmm.

36:19.960 --> 36:22.640
When they started having conversations

36:22.720 --> 36:27.320
about Billy's body
being used by someone else,

36:27.400 --> 36:28.840
it became quite real.

36:30.520 --> 36:32.320
[with Yugoslavian accent]
I committed robbery.

36:32.400 --> 36:35.960
I did not commit crime
of sexual misconduct.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.400
I will not be accused of rape.

36:44.640 --> 36:46.720
I don't want to go through this again.

36:50.920 --> 36:53.520
Miss Turner, would you please
tell him that?

36:54.280 --> 36:56.200
I don't want to go through this again.

36:56.720 --> 37:00.040
[Wilbur] But we need to talk with you
in order to help all of you.

37:01.760 --> 37:03.320
But they just don't understand…

37:04.840 --> 37:05.960
what love is.

37:07.120 --> 37:08.880
What the need for love is.

37:11.240 --> 37:12.800
To be held by somebody,

37:16.040 --> 37:17.440
just to feel warm.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.480
I don't know why I did it.

37:26.720 --> 37:29.600
I was just so lonely.

37:31.840 --> 37:33.280
I ruined their lives,

37:34.080 --> 37:35.600
I ruined the boys' lives.

37:46.160 --> 37:48.840
Well, it appears from the best evidence
we've been able to assemble

37:48.920 --> 37:51.000
that Ragen, the Yugoslavian,

37:51.080 --> 37:52.960
is the one who set out
to commit some crimes

37:53.040 --> 37:55.400
set out to commit some robberies.

37:55.480 --> 37:58.240
It also appears that Adalana, the lesbian,

37:58.320 --> 38:01.280
is the one that actually
committed the sexual act.

38:01.360 --> 38:04.160
But the question is,
how do you prosecute Ragen

38:04.240 --> 38:07.160
when your indictment
charges Billy Milligan?

38:08.680 --> 38:10.320
Gary's Schweickart was in my office

38:10.400 --> 38:12.280
and he says,
"By the way, on Billy Milligan,

38:12.360 --> 38:14.680
he has multiple personalities,"
and dah-dah-dah-dah.

38:14.760 --> 38:18.680
I said, "Well, I don't care which
personality he wants to go to prison,

38:18.760 --> 38:20.240
but one of them's going to prison."

38:20.840 --> 38:22.760
What are they going to do with Adalana?

38:22.840 --> 38:26.240
Put her in women's prison? Impossible.

38:26.960 --> 38:30.400
The reason why
multiple personality disorder, or DID,

38:30.480 --> 38:35.120
is not a good fit with
contemporary standards of legal insanity

38:36.280 --> 38:39.520
is really more
of a philosophical question, if you will.

38:39.600 --> 38:42.160
Which is,
what does it mean to be a person?

38:42.240 --> 38:44.920
What does it mean to have responsibility?

38:45.000 --> 38:50.080
What does it mean when,
perhaps, one part of a person's persona

38:50.160 --> 38:53.520
doesn't realize there's
another part of a person's persona?

38:53.960 --> 38:57.560
Um, these are very hard concepts to prove,

38:57.640 --> 39:04.320
but they are also difficult concepts
to understand how to handle legally.

39:05.440 --> 39:08.680
The question was whether Billy
knew that what he was doing

39:08.760 --> 39:10.840
was legally incorrect,

39:11.360 --> 39:15.640
and another part
of the insanity statute at the time

39:16.160 --> 39:19.280
was to determine whether or not Billy

39:19.360 --> 39:22.080
could refrain from the wrongful behavior.

39:26.320 --> 39:30.080
[Harding]
What about the question of responsibility

39:30.160 --> 39:32.840
for the acts that were
committed last October

39:32.920 --> 39:35.080
when he was fragmented?

39:35.160 --> 39:38.760
He may, on the other hand,
have been very intact

39:38.880 --> 39:42.000
and not fragmented at all at that time.

39:42.080 --> 39:45.280
I just don't understand how
you could say that he is not fragmented

39:45.360 --> 39:47.120
when we know that Ragen
performed part of it,

39:47.200 --> 39:49.640
we know that Adalana did,
we know that Tommy comes on the spot--

39:49.720 --> 39:52.920
What do you--
No, no, from a more legal point of view,

39:53.000 --> 39:54.880
why are you talking
about these different people?

39:54.960 --> 39:56.800
That guy, his name is Bill Milligan.

39:56.880 --> 39:58.280
I don't care what he calls himself.

39:58.360 --> 40:01.040
He's Bill Milligan.
He can deny that up and down

40:01.120 --> 40:02.800
and he's the one that raped them.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.560
[Milligan]
I can't really distinct between memories

40:09.360 --> 40:10.760
to realities…

40:12.680 --> 40:15.520
because my emotions split so far apart:

40:16.400 --> 40:18.640
love, hate and fear.

40:26.080 --> 40:27.640
It was obvious at that point

40:27.720 --> 40:33.360
that he was not capable
at that instant of standing trial.

40:37.880 --> 40:42.400
[Harding] We tried to find ways
that he could deal with the stress.

40:42.480 --> 40:44.560
A way that, uh…

40:44.640 --> 40:49.160
that he would
not be so inclined to split apart.

40:49.240 --> 40:50.600
[Wilbur] When you get fused,

40:50.680 --> 40:52.960
then everybody "hears" from everybody else

40:53.040 --> 40:54.760
and knows all about everybody else,

40:54.840 --> 40:56.400
then you won't be confused.

40:57.760 --> 41:01.040
Wouldn't it be nice
to bring all of you together

41:02.640 --> 41:05.120
into one person?

41:06.320 --> 41:09.120
Yeah, but that
seems like it'd be a little weird.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.120
[Wilbur] No, it wouldn't be a little weird

41:11.200 --> 41:14.440
because you all got born
from the same person originally.

41:17.080 --> 41:21.960
What fusion means
is that the personalities

41:22.040 --> 41:25.200
have melded back together.

41:25.280 --> 41:30.360
That doesn't mean
that they aren't influential.

41:30.440 --> 41:34.680
It just means that the core personality

41:34.760 --> 41:37.200
is acting as one.

41:38.360 --> 41:40.960
[on tape] This is a very talented
and very bright young man,

41:41.040 --> 41:45.600
and not to be able to save him
is, I think, a real tragedy.

41:46.440 --> 41:49.440
They feel sorry for him
because if he goes to prison,

41:49.520 --> 41:51.480
he's not going to get any therapy there.

41:51.560 --> 41:54.480
That's probably gonna be
the end of it, in a sense, okay?

41:54.560 --> 41:57.080
Now, so the psychiatrists, the healers

41:57.160 --> 41:59.520
are coming into it
with that kind of attitude.

41:59.600 --> 42:02.200
And "anything we can do to help him."

42:02.280 --> 42:05.360
And I think what they're doing
is then they're mucking it up,

42:05.440 --> 42:07.400
they're getting very confused.

42:07.480 --> 42:10.840
Uh, "It's wrong to send him to prison.
He won't get treatment."

42:10.920 --> 42:12.800
"Isn't it awful?"

42:15.280 --> 42:18.520
Multiple personality disorder
creates a kind of excitement

42:18.600 --> 42:22.760
in therapists and in patients
that made it remarkably popular.

42:22.840 --> 42:26.080
Dr. Wilbur, who's a famous person now

42:26.160 --> 42:28.200
because of the book and the movie Sybil,

42:28.280 --> 42:34.560
creating with the defense attorneys
a plausible excuse for his three rapes.

42:34.640 --> 42:37.720
But I think we need
to work toward fusion.

42:38.320 --> 42:40.400
We don't take him to court
until they're fused.

42:41.720 --> 42:44.520
And you can fuse them very early

42:44.600 --> 42:47.160
and take them to court
and get the court thing over with.

42:49.640 --> 42:51.720
She's a very dramatic woman.

42:52.600 --> 42:57.440
She would say, "I want you
to fuse Ragen and Billy."

42:57.520 --> 42:59.040
"Fuse!"

43:01.160 --> 43:04.960
I don't think that's the way
the mind operates.

43:05.600 --> 43:06.960
[Wilbur] You and Allen…

43:08.800 --> 43:09.920
fuse together.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.400
-You become Danny Allen.
-Danny Allen?

43:12.480 --> 43:14.280
[Wilbur] Yeah. You become Danny Allen.

43:14.360 --> 43:15.520
I'm not Danny.

43:16.440 --> 43:18.400
-I'm sorry. You're Tommy. Yeah.
-I'm Tommy.

43:18.920 --> 43:21.240
You become Tommy Allen, all in one person.

43:21.320 --> 43:22.400
Do it right now.

43:23.160 --> 43:25.200
I can't do that for a reason.

43:25.680 --> 43:26.960
Why?

43:27.040 --> 43:30.240
Because some of the things
that Allen likes I can't stand.

43:30.320 --> 43:31.280
[Wilbur] Like what?

43:33.760 --> 43:34.640
Baseball.

43:41.040 --> 43:44.080
[with Yugoslovian accent] I don't know.
The possibility seem ridiculous.

43:46.720 --> 43:50.080
I'm trying to figure out
how this fusion occurs.

43:50.720 --> 43:56.240
[Harding] And, uh,
it seemed that he did make progress

43:56.320 --> 43:57.880
during that time.

43:58.600 --> 44:04.760
And that, uh, he did grow in his therapy.

44:05.760 --> 44:07.480
[Wilbur] Are you going to try the fusion?

44:07.560 --> 44:09.880
Arthur says he's doing the best he can do.

44:09.960 --> 44:14.560
-[Wilbur] Yeah, what about Ragen?
-Yeah, but he's going to fuse with Arthur.

44:14.640 --> 44:16.880
[Wilbur]
So, you're all going to be fused together?

44:16.960 --> 44:17.960
Oh, I'll try.

44:18.040 --> 44:20.400
[Wilbur] Okay, fine. That's all we ask.

44:21.480 --> 44:25.760
I haven't seen Billy
for a couple of weeks, maybe more

44:25.880 --> 44:27.360
and I do see progress.

44:27.440 --> 44:31.520
Yes, I think the comment that we…
We've done a lot today.

44:32.760 --> 44:35.040
He had been rendered
competent to stand trial

44:35.120 --> 44:40.840
because the psychiatrists said that
they fused the personalities all into one

44:40.920 --> 44:43.280
and, therefore, the real Billy Milligan

44:43.360 --> 44:47.200
was the person
that was there, available for trial.

44:49.760 --> 44:54.000
[Sherman] Insanity defense is very rare,
very hard to… hard to win.

44:54.080 --> 44:56.920
I'll bet in the years…

44:57.000 --> 44:59.520
if you went back
ten years in this courthouse,

44:59.600 --> 45:02.920
maybe you'll find two or three
insanity defenses that work.

45:03.000 --> 45:07.400
What I've learned about
the law and mental illness

45:07.480 --> 45:11.600
is that the many people
in the legal system

45:11.680 --> 45:15.920
see that as an excuse for behavior

45:16.000 --> 45:17.800
and they're not going to support it.

45:17.880 --> 45:21.640
They think the person is faking,
think the person is playing a victim.

45:28.080 --> 45:30.120
I don't think
that he's multiple personality.

45:30.200 --> 45:33.360
I don't really believe that that exists.

45:33.440 --> 45:35.720
Seems to me, it'd be
an awful easy thing to fake.

45:36.680 --> 45:40.160
There was a lot of discussion
from people who really believed that this

45:40.240 --> 45:43.120
was what Billy Milligan
was suffering from,

45:43.200 --> 45:45.560
to those that believe that he was actually

45:45.640 --> 45:49.280
trying to pull the wool
over the criminal justice system.

45:49.360 --> 45:52.280
In the newsroom, for instance,

45:52.360 --> 45:54.880
most of the reporters
were skeptical of it.

45:54.960 --> 46:00.200
I knew a lot of local prosecutors
and police officers

46:00.280 --> 46:02.480
and most of them were skeptical of it too.

46:02.560 --> 46:04.520
Now the psychiatrists,

46:04.600 --> 46:07.200
they were the ones that, uh, believed him.

46:09.880 --> 46:13.880
Only a tiny minority
of therapists were believers.

46:14.920 --> 46:18.560
This was not something
that spread to the field at large,

46:18.640 --> 46:21.960
but that tiny minority
were in a very powerful position.

46:23.720 --> 46:25.960
[reporter 3]
Dr. Martin Orne, a respected psychiatrist

46:26.040 --> 46:28.400
who believes multiple personalities exist,

46:28.480 --> 46:30.520
is worried that a doctor may actually

46:30.600 --> 46:32.840
plant the idea in the patient's head.

46:33.360 --> 46:38.320
Great care must be taken in the use
of hypnosis with these individuals

46:38.400 --> 46:42.320
so that you don't create the problems,
which you think you're curing.

46:42.840 --> 46:45.280
[reporter 3] Orne is worried
about the power of suggestion.

46:45.360 --> 46:49.160
He says the impact
of the best-selling book and movie Sybil

46:49.240 --> 46:50.600
cannot be overlooked.

46:50.680 --> 46:54.680
Sybil mobilized the people
who most believed in hypnosis

46:54.760 --> 46:57.400
and most believed in
multiple personality disorder,

46:57.480 --> 46:59.200
gave them legitimacy,

46:59.280 --> 47:01.880
and they began
talking to large groups of therapists,

47:01.960 --> 47:04.640
giving weekend workshops
all around the country.

47:05.240 --> 47:07.960
And that increased
the tremendous excitement

47:08.040 --> 47:09.680
about multiple personality disorder.

47:09.760 --> 47:13.120
We approached this case with care,

47:13.680 --> 47:15.080
some skepticism,

47:15.800 --> 47:20.600
and we have, uh,
we have studied him very carefully.

47:20.680 --> 47:25.320
We believe that we've documented
a definable psychiatric syndrome here,

47:25.400 --> 47:29.640
a real illness, and we think
that's a significant thing.

47:30.280 --> 47:32.040
Gary and Judy and I

47:32.920 --> 47:37.160
talked before the trial date.

47:37.800 --> 47:43.200
We stipulated
that the written reports from Dr. Harding

47:43.280 --> 47:45.560
would be their testimony.

47:54.560 --> 47:58.200
The prosecution
did not even contest the case.

47:58.280 --> 48:01.760
It was done not before a jury,
but before a judge.

48:01.840 --> 48:03.800
They all believed the psychiatrists

48:03.880 --> 48:07.680
and so involved in this
belief in multiple personality disorder

48:07.760 --> 48:10.320
that they didn't
see all the biases involved.

48:11.200 --> 48:14.360
You don't know how many years
that we'd do in prison, then?

48:14.440 --> 48:17.040
[Wilbur] You might not
have to go to prison at all.

48:17.120 --> 48:19.160
Well, last time we got in trouble.

48:19.240 --> 48:23.000
[Wilbur] Yeah, but they didn't know then
that you had this the matter with you.

48:23.080 --> 48:27.040
Together, Wilbur and, uh, Milligan,

48:27.520 --> 48:30.640
maybe sincerely on her part, who knows?

48:30.720 --> 48:32.840
Probably not sincerely on his part,

48:32.920 --> 48:36.600
we're able to create a narrative
of multiple personalities

48:37.160 --> 48:40.560
that would explain to the public

48:40.640 --> 48:44.360
and excuse to the legal system
the terrible crimes he committed.

48:54.840 --> 48:58.120
Milligan's court-appointed psychiatrist
says he is mentally ill.

48:58.200 --> 49:00.760
Nevertheless, he has been
found competent to stand trial.

49:00.880 --> 49:02.520
It will begin in December.

49:04.160 --> 49:06.800
[Schmerbeck]
Judge Flowers was really well-liked

49:06.880 --> 49:10.400
by both prosecution and defense attorneys.

49:10.480 --> 49:12.080
They felt he was a fair judge.

49:12.600 --> 49:17.000
[Porter] He was not one of these people
who didn't believe in the diagnosis

49:17.080 --> 49:19.400
or had any preconceived ideas.

49:20.240 --> 49:22.800
And so that was good for Billy Milligan

49:22.880 --> 49:26.720
because Gary and Judy
knew that he would listen

49:26.800 --> 49:28.400
to what they had to say

49:28.480 --> 49:33.280
and would consider
all of the information that was there.

49:33.360 --> 49:35.400
Billy didn't do this. Billy wasn't here.

49:35.480 --> 49:37.520
Billy was someplace else at the time.

49:37.600 --> 49:40.360
The person being tried
did not commit any crimes.

49:40.880 --> 49:42.080
He was not there.

49:42.600 --> 49:45.080
It was undisputed he committed the crimes.

49:45.160 --> 49:46.880
The question is
whether he was insane or not.

49:46.960 --> 49:49.040
All the evidence conclusively established

49:49.120 --> 49:50.720
he was insane at the time.

49:51.840 --> 49:55.400
Billy Milligan's defense team,
with the help of Wilbur,

49:55.480 --> 49:57.240
took advantage of that,

49:57.320 --> 50:03.080
and having several psychiatrists write
that he wasn't responsible for the crime

50:03.160 --> 50:05.640
because it was done
by one of his multiples

50:05.720 --> 50:07.320
that he could not control

50:07.400 --> 50:09.680
and was not even aware of,

50:09.760 --> 50:10.960
worked as a defense

50:11.040 --> 50:15.240
but only because it was a period
where the insanity defense was liberal.

50:15.920 --> 50:20.200
It was a period in which
the, um, multiple personality disorder

50:20.280 --> 50:23.440
has been popular
only in very brief periods

50:23.520 --> 50:25.360
in very special places.

50:29.240 --> 50:31.960
[reporter 4] Mental experts
say 23-year-old William Milligan

50:32.040 --> 50:35.160
has possessed ten different
and conflicting personalities

50:35.240 --> 50:36.360
for most of his life.

50:36.440 --> 50:39.080
Since Milligan
waived his right to a jury trial,

50:39.160 --> 50:43.080
statements by psychiatrists
were presented to Judge Jay Flowers.

50:43.160 --> 50:47.160
Today, Milligan went on trial for rape,
kidnap and aggravated assault.

50:47.760 --> 50:51.000
At some point,
when that victim as a child,

50:51.080 --> 50:53.320
becomes a perpetrator as an adult,

50:53.400 --> 50:56.360
I really sort of switch allegiances

50:56.440 --> 51:00.240
and I feel like society needs
to be safe from the perpetrator.

51:02.440 --> 51:05.840
Rape, at the time, was a crime

51:05.920 --> 51:10.800
with a maximum penalty
of ten to 25 for each count.

51:10.880 --> 51:14.080
He faced nine counts, that would be what?

51:14.160 --> 51:19.080
Seventy-five to 200 and some years.

51:20.520 --> 51:22.760
[reporter 5] During the trial,
he was described as a victim

51:22.840 --> 51:23.800
of severe child abuse.

51:23.880 --> 51:25.880
[reporter 6] A report
from a psychiatric hospital

51:25.960 --> 51:27.760
says he was abused as a child,

51:27.840 --> 51:31.320
beaten and even sodomized
by his stepfather several times a week.

51:31.400 --> 51:34.440
To flee from this abuse,
doctors say, he split his real self

51:34.520 --> 51:36.080
into ten different people.

51:42.640 --> 51:47.040
One of Billy Milligan's victims
was engaged to be married.

51:47.960 --> 51:50.280
All of that fell apart after her rape.

51:50.360 --> 51:52.600
I remember that testimony to this day.

51:52.680 --> 51:54.160
It was chilling.

51:54.720 --> 51:57.840
I never doubted that it was true.

51:58.520 --> 52:00.680
I wanted to convict him.

52:00.760 --> 52:02.360
I wanted to send him to prison.

52:03.080 --> 52:06.160
It's very hard
to make an insanity defense.

52:06.240 --> 52:11.000
And again, I'm not so sure that's even
in the best interest of the client.

52:11.080 --> 52:12.760
You know? [chuckles]

52:12.840 --> 52:16.720
The medical data
that I had without exception

52:16.800 --> 52:19.920
was to the effect that he did
have this multiple personality

52:20.000 --> 52:24.640
and that he, in effect, qualified
as being insane under our statute.

52:26.520 --> 52:29.800
[reporter 7] Today, he was found
not guilty for reasons of insanity.

52:29.880 --> 52:32.160
He was found innocent
by reason of insanity.

52:32.240 --> 52:33.960
…of rape, kidnapping and robbery.

52:34.920 --> 52:40.360
This court hearing today
wasn't to sell any type of sob story.

52:41.520 --> 52:45.560
And I hope that someday
somebody will have it in their heart

52:45.640 --> 52:48.400
to make sure this doesn't
happen to somebody else.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.680
Uh, disappointed, in a sense.

52:53.760 --> 52:57.760
I mean, this was a case
that I felt strongly I could make,

52:57.840 --> 53:01.040
and these were women who were assaulted

53:01.120 --> 53:06.960
and deserved to have the person
who assaulted them punished for it.

53:07.040 --> 53:09.720
I was a little bit disturbed by it

53:09.800 --> 53:14.120
because, you know, what about
the people that were actually harmed?

53:14.200 --> 53:16.840
You think about victims, victims' rights…

53:16.920 --> 53:20.360
and I didn't know what the repercussions
were going to be after that.

53:20.440 --> 53:25.240
I would never ever
want a victim of rape to think,

53:25.320 --> 53:26.960
or in particular his victims,

53:27.040 --> 53:31.560
to think that I excuse his behavior
because he was mentally ill.

53:33.080 --> 53:34.920
It doesn't change what he did.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.680
It can never be undone.

53:36.760 --> 53:40.400
[dramatic music playing]

53:43.160 --> 53:46.520
[Frances] It happened
this one time, with this one judge,

53:46.600 --> 53:48.840
with this one prosecuting attorney.

53:48.920 --> 53:51.440
It's never happened
anywhere else in the world.

53:51.520 --> 53:54.400
It's a kind of temporary insanity.

53:54.480 --> 53:56.680
Not of Billy Milligan, but of the system.

54:00.640 --> 54:03.360
Being found not guilty
by reason of insanity is no great deal

54:03.440 --> 54:06.720
because you're still locked up,
you're still confined, still watched.

54:07.720 --> 54:12.520
The worst thing to hear from anybody
is the truth about yourself,

54:12.600 --> 54:15.960
and I don't want to escape anymore.

54:16.880 --> 54:18.880
I want to stay right where I'm at.

54:19.960 --> 54:22.720
It might not be
a very nice world out there,

54:23.440 --> 54:25.920
but it's the best I've got
and I want to keep it.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.360
Is it a hoax? Has he been faking it?

54:28.440 --> 54:30.680
Whether he was a slick con artist

54:30.760 --> 54:34.320
or whether he was the victim
of child abuse…

54:34.400 --> 54:36.600
To me, he was probably more of a con man

54:36.680 --> 54:42.640
who was able to use a rising tide
to surf away from criminal responsibility.

54:42.720 --> 54:44.920
-He should have an Academy Award.
-For what?

54:45.000 --> 54:46.640
For the performance he's put on.

54:48.240 --> 54:51.560
Billy Milligan was a very bright young man

54:52.120 --> 54:56.480
and was not just a, uh, clever con man.

54:57.520 --> 55:03.400
I really didn't ever
doubt the veracity of this

55:03.480 --> 55:07.720
and clearly it had also
convinced the prosecuting attorneys.

55:07.800 --> 55:11.240
Even the victims felt
there was something unusual about him.

55:11.320 --> 55:16.800
I mean, it was a really strange…
the whole thing, and it made sense.

55:16.920 --> 55:19.480
[Preston] Nobody's going
to be faking it for that many years

55:19.560 --> 55:22.040
or in front of that many people,
and that consistently.

55:22.120 --> 55:25.960
[man 2] A lot of arguments back and forth
as to whether he really was faking it,

55:26.040 --> 55:29.880
or was he cured and was he safe
to put out into the community?

55:29.960 --> 55:35.440
[Putnam] He had committed what normally
would be considered very serious crimes

55:35.520 --> 55:39.040
and was potentially capable
of doing others.

55:39.120 --> 55:41.520
People became extremely concerned.

55:41.600 --> 55:43.240
Women became terrified.

55:43.320 --> 55:44.520
He should not be out.

55:44.600 --> 55:46.000
He is a menace to women.

55:46.080 --> 55:48.360
He should be in prison
where rapists belong.

55:48.440 --> 55:49.960
They were pissed off.

55:50.480 --> 55:52.480
[reporter 8] Doctors say
he needs further treatment

55:52.560 --> 55:54.880
and that without it,
he could easily snap again

55:54.960 --> 55:58.160
and become dominated
by a variety of different personalities.

55:58.240 --> 55:59.400
Now what did that mean?

55:59.480 --> 56:03.560
Did that mean he was
going to be in psychiatric wards

56:03.640 --> 56:05.680
for the rest of his life?

56:08.760 --> 56:11.640
I knew that he was
turned over to psychiatric care,

56:11.720 --> 56:13.720
but how are they going to help him?

56:14.480 --> 56:18.880
[Putnam] There were a number of incidents
that Billy got into significant problems.

56:18.960 --> 56:22.400
[Preston] All it was doing
was making him fracture more.

56:23.320 --> 56:27.200
I personally feel very strongly

56:27.280 --> 56:30.440
that there is at least
another personality out there

56:30.520 --> 56:32.440
that nobody has identified yet.

56:32.520 --> 56:33.880
Just a few others.
