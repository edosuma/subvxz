Did you see the gunman?
Not really.

06:13.940 --> 06:16.204
Not really?

Well, you see,
when I ran in, he shot at me,

06:19.612 --> 06:21.773
and I ducked and hid
behind a counter.

06:21.848 --> 06:25.045
Then I heard him running out
into the alleyway, but when I got there,
he was already gone.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.052
Oh.

06:27.120 --> 06:32.057
Well, can you describe him?
No. See, he was behind me.
He used a silencer.

You're sure?
Yes. Yes, I'm positive.

06:34.527 --> 06:36.995
Because when he fired the shot at me,
I never heard it.

Well, how many shots
did you hear?
Two.

06:39.732 --> 06:42.166

got off two rounds.
Yeah.

he hid behind a counter,

No. No, that- that would be fine.

due to my timing,

Well, I- I didn't see him,
but I think Kyle did.

12:32.518 --> 12:35.749
No. According to police reports,
he never identified the murderer.

12:35.821 --> 12:38.255
That's because his mother
never let him talk to the police.

that someone was chasing him,

because of his brace.

He tried to kill me!

26:05.964 --> 26:09.058
Let me see.
All right. It's not so bad.
It just abraded the dermal layer.

It's a flesh wound.

- Calling 91 1 .

No.
Laura, someone
is shooting at us.

We are involved!

26:39.197 --> 26:43.793
If you call the police, I swear
I'll take Kyle and run. I swear it.
Hang up the phone.

26:52.510 --> 26:54.774

To see if the sniper's still there.

- Sam!
- Did you find anything?

27:06.725 --> 27:10.661
No, there's no spent casings
or anything around.
The guy must be a pro.

you changed history.

I see what happens when we
don't do what needs to be done.

28:01.446 --> 28:05.348
If Kyle had talked to the police,
maybe they would've caught that wacko
before he shot at us.

Kyle, get ready for bed.
I'm almost done-

28:07.952 --> 28:11.285
Now, Kyle!
No. I need to talk
to him now.

28:11.356 --> 28:13.290
He is <i>my</i> son.

what's best for you.

We can't seem to agree

Now let me try mine.

29:22.293 --> 29:25.091
When he shot Phil,
I ducked behind the counter.

29:25.163 --> 29:27.097
I could only see his shoes.

29:30.702 --> 29:33.796
- What did his shoes look like?
- Shoes.

29:33.872 --> 29:37.364
Oh, yeah.
He hid money in them.

29:37.442 --> 29:40.639
- He hid money in his shoes?
- I could see it peeking out.

No, I don't know.

29:56.261 --> 29:58.320
Well, you wouldn't.

30:00.064 --> 30:04.899
Gee, this place kind of reminds me
of my thir- four- third
father-in-law's place.

30:04.969 --> 30:07.563
He had a pharmacy?
No, a funeral parlor.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.573

Uh, why are we, uh,

I don't know. I'm just lookin' for
something the police might have missed.
What else can I do?

30:19.584 --> 30:23.076
I don't know.
You can get Kyle to remember better,
but of course, you-you know-

30:23.154 --> 30:25.679
This is where I found him-
right down here.

30:27.892 --> 30:32.727

The only thing you can see from here
would be somebody's shoes.

and went off the road, onto the shoulder,
broke the A-frame under the car.

About an hour.

you found on the drugstore floor?

<i>Kyle.!</i>
[ Screams ]

40:33.397 --> 40:36.662
Let go! Let me go!
No! No!

40:36.734 --> 40:40.363
Shh, shh. It's me.
It's me. It's me.

40:40.438 --> 40:43.373
It's okay. It's okay.
You're safe.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.342
<i>I don't think so, Sam.</i>

40:48.279 --> 40:51.180
You don't have to do this.

40:51.248 --> 40:54.149
- Yes, I do.
- You bastard!

40:54.218 --> 40:57.710
- No, look. Kyle.
-<i>[ Kyle Panting ]</i>

40:57.788 --> 41:01.519
<i>This is the detective</i>
<i>who's looking into Phil's murder.</i>

41:01.592 --> 41:03.583
Have you ever seen him?
No.

41:03.661 --> 41:06.562
Are you sure?
You're sure? See? See?

41:06.630 --> 41:09.326
He doesn't even-
He doesn't even know
who you are.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.994
But you do.

41:12.069 --> 41:14.003
No!
<i>[ Gunshot ]</i>

41:14.071 --> 41:16.198
<i>Sam.!</i>

41:30.621 --> 41:32.555
<i>What happened?</i>

41:32.623 --> 41:35.023
That'll teach the bastard
to take a shot at me.

41:35.092 --> 41:38.357
<i>Chloe. You are</i>
<i>one hell of a woman.</i>

41:39.630 --> 41:43.726
- Uh-oh.
- Too bad Ward didn't realize that.

41:43.801 --> 41:46.429
You called the police,
didn't you?

41:46.504 --> 41:51.203
<i>Sort of.</i>
<i>I told them I was Laura</i>
<i>and on my way up here.</i>

41:51.275 --> 41:55.871
<i>Then she knew that</i>
<i>that dirtbag was the killer?</i>

41:55.946 --> 41:59.712
- You hired him, didn't you?
- And I thought you only gave good hair.

41:59.783 --> 42:01.876
Then she was behind
the whole thing.

42:01.952 --> 42:05.080
You own a company
named Eloch, and-

42:05.155 --> 42:08.181
Eloch. Eloch is
an anagram for Chloe.

42:08.259 --> 42:12.559
- How could we have missed that?
- How could Ziggy have-have missed it?

42:12.630 --> 42:15.258
- We can't all be geniuses.
- Mommy!

42:15.332 --> 42:19.701
I'm afraid Ward
bashed her brains out, kid.

42:21.071 --> 42:23.062
I really hate doing this.

42:23.140 --> 42:27.406
<i>You're actually</i>
<i>a pretty cute kid.</i>
Look,just wait a second. Okay?

42:29.713 --> 42:34.275
<i>What</i>- <i>Wh0-</i>
<i>Who were you sellin'the drugs to?</i>

42:34.351 --> 42:36.785
Oh, she was sellin'
to-to-to your customers.

42:36.854 --> 42:41.052
- <i>Oh,you're stalling for time. Okay, I'm sorry.</i>
- No stalls, Frank.

42:42.493 --> 42:45.519
- Kyle!

[ Gasping, Spits ]

43:23.601 --> 43:26.195
Mommy! Mommy!

43:32.876 --> 43:34.867
[ Sobbing ]

43:38.349 --> 43:41.318
Well, you've got a concussion.

43:42.319 --> 43:46.278
We're gonna have to sit up
with you tonight and get you
to a hospital tomorrow.

43:48.626 --> 43:50.617
You, on the other hand-

43:52.162 --> 43:54.392
You do not have a concussion.

43:54.465 --> 43:57.832
But she's gonna be all right?
She's gonna be fine, Sam.

43:57.901 --> 44:01.132
In fact, she starts a support group
for victims of violent crime,

44:01.205 --> 44:03.230
and, uh, she helps
a lot of people.

44:03.307 --> 44:05.002
Yeah, she's gonna
be just fine.

44:05.075 --> 44:08.511
I think I'd like to hear that
from a real doctor.
Oh, well, I am.

44:08.579 --> 44:10.342
Sam.

44:10.414 --> 44:14.214
A very good doctor,
for a hairdresser.

44:15.519 --> 44:19.546
You're a very good man,
period.
Yeah.

44:19.623 --> 44:21.557
Hey, Sam, get this-

44:21.625 --> 44:25.891
Kyle wins the hundred-meter butterfly
in the 1 994 Special Olympics.

44:25.963 --> 44:28.761
I didn't think you could swim.
I can't.

44:30.467 --> 44:34.369
Is it my concussion that
is making this conversation
seem so weird?

44:34.438 --> 44:36.497
Uh, well, probably.

44:36.573 --> 44:39.007
- Will you teach me to swim, Frank?
- Yeah, that's who teaches him.

44:39.076 --> 44:41.704
Sure, I'll teach you.

44:41.779 --> 44:45.237
Or better yet, you know,
we'll get you in some really
good classes at the " Y.''

44:45.315 --> 44:48.716
Oh, now you changed history.
Now he- now he wins the gold.

44:48.786 --> 44:50.720
<i>[ Al Chuckles ]</i>

44:50.788 --> 44:55.282
Well, see, that's the difference
between a father teaching his son
and a pro.

44:55.359 --> 44:59.193
Father?
What are you saying, Frank?

45:00.564 --> 45:03.556
- Um-
- That's okay. Frank and Laura get married.

45:04.802 --> 45:09.136
I guess- I guess
I'm asking you to marry me.

45:09.206 --> 45:11.140
Frank. M-Me.

45:11.208 --> 45:13.802
You guess?

45:15.345 --> 45:18.212
I guess " guess'' is not
the best choice of words, Sam.

45:19.416 --> 45:21.543
[ Chuckles ]

45:21.618 --> 45:23.381
[ Clears Throat ]

45:25.289 --> 45:28.656
Will you marry me?
Yes!

45:30.728 --> 45:34.164
Yes. Yes.

45:48.779 --> 45:50.906
Everything's gonna be okay.

45:50.981 --> 45:54.382
It's all over. You did just fine.

<i>Multiple contusions,</i>
<i>vaginal perineal tears,</i>
<i>perineal lacerations.</i>

46:01.925 --> 46:03.859
Well, uh, I-
I don't think that-

46:03.927 --> 46:06.828
She's still dazed
from the attack.
It's gonna be okay.

46:07.898 --> 46:10.924
-Just give it a little more time.
- You folks all done with her?

46:11.001 --> 46:13.697
Oh, no, not again.

46:13.771 --> 46:15.932
Again?

Have you been raped before?

46:24.047 --> 46:26.345
Oh, boy.
