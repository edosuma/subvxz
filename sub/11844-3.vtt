 Well, we agree on this.

Isabel,
 you are not alone.

14:31.680 --> 14:34.483
Not even talk
 to other guys?

14:34.583 --> 14:37.219
- Works for me.
 - I don't think so.

14:37.319 --> 14:39.688
Isabel, you do not
 belong with him.

14:39.788 --> 14:41.990
No. I belong with you.

But I don't think
 either one of us wants to
 think about that too much.

14:50.365 --> 14:52.201
- What's going on?
 - Nothing.

 We've got to find her.

16:01.223 --> 16:03.592
I think we should start
 with Sorenson.

He showed up here bleeding.
 He'd been struggling
 with someone.

16:07.263 --> 16:10.466
Grant has nothing
 to do with this, Max.
 I'll be the judge of that.

16:10.566 --> 16:14.136
- We've got a problem.
 - I know. Tess is missing.

16:14.236 --> 16:16.939
Oh, boohoo. Sorry.
 She's missing?

16:17.039 --> 16:19.241
Isabel had a vision
 that she was in trouble.
 [Maria] that's weird.

16:19.341 --> 16:22.511
Here's something else weird.
 Whitaker has been taping
 my phone conversations at work.

16:22.611 --> 16:27.583
I found a cd.
 But the thing is, how come
 she hasn't busted me yet?

16:27.683 --> 16:29.151
Maybe because she hasn't
 given up alien hunting
 after all.

16:29.251 --> 16:31.987
- She's out there right now.
 - At my party?

16:32.087 --> 16:34.356
Yeah. She sort of
 invited herself.

16:36.091 --> 16:38.394
So, the real party's in here.

16:38.494 --> 16:41.397
- Go refill the ketchups.
 - Done.

16:41.497 --> 16:44.333
Sugars then.

16:46.569 --> 16:48.671
Maybe Whitaker's got something
 to do with this Tess thing.

16:48.771 --> 16:51.273
Michael, you go to her office,
 see what you can find.

16:51.373 --> 16:53.542
I'm going to get Valenti.
 We'll check out Sorenson.
 What should I do?

16:53.642 --> 16:56.645
Make sure Whitaker stays here,
 so Michael can search
 her office.

16:56.745 --> 16:58.681
I can't just stay here,
 knowing everything
 that's happening.

 Just try to enjoy your party.

 who saw the visions.
 I'm going after her.

Let me take care of it.

17:17.099 --> 17:20.169

 the birthday girl.

Oh, Isabel, this is
 congresswoman Whitaker.

- Hi. It's nice to meet you.
 - Hello. I'm Diane Evans,
 Isabel's mother.

It's such an honor
 to have you here.

 - Nothing. I-- You know, I've--

18:33.776 --> 18:38.547
I've had this headache all day.
 I think there's aspirin
 in the back.

18:44.219 --> 18:46.322
Did you have another vision?
 Give me your keys.

18:46.422 --> 18:48.824
No way. Last time I Lent out
 the Jetta, an uzi took out
 the back window.

18:48.924 --> 18:50.759
Then drive me.
 Where?

18:50.859 --> 18:53.896
To look for Tess.
 I saw a sign: "Red's."
 There's no Red's in Roswell.

18:53.996 --> 18:55.898
I know Tess isn't
 your favorite person.

18:55.998 --> 18:58.067
We've all treated her pretty
 badly. I'm not proud of
 the way I've acted.

18:58.167 --> 19:00.069
I can't help it, Isabel.
 I don't trust her.

19:00.169 --> 19:01.570
Then trust me.

19:01.670 --> 19:03.906
Okay, I think
 I know where it is.
 Let's go.

19:04.006 --> 19:05.741
No. Max said not to leave.

19:05.841 --> 19:08.243
- Max isn't here.
 - Okay, fine. I'll go with you.

19:08.344 --> 19:12.548
No. No, you have
 to cover for me. Okay?

 but Nasedo.

19:42.144 --> 19:44.780

 It was too complicated.

Hi. I'm calling
 from the phone company.
 We're checking the lines.

20:21.583 --> 20:24.420
What lines?
 This is a cell phone.

20:24.520 --> 20:27.856
Right. I mean, we're
 checking the service.

20:27.956 --> 20:30.359
This is 555-0188?

20:30.459 --> 20:33.796

 And the number
 is billed to?

That's what I have.
 Thank you.

21:57.713 --> 22:01.016

 thrown out of the car.

22:02.184 --> 22:05.187
I don't think so.
 Uh--

22:05.287 --> 22:08.157
Maybe the paramedics
 already came?

22:08.257 --> 22:09.625
No.

22:19.034 --> 22:21.336

But look. Here they swerve
 near Tess's car,

22:38.333 --> 22:41.336
then go out
 in that direction.

 Oh. No, no.
 Now, you don't know that.

 We need to get back
 to Michael.

23:27.148 --> 23:30.718

 No. You're not going in there
 by yourself, Isabel.

 Michael, all right? Just go.

23:35.757 --> 23:38.493
But I can't wait.
 I have to go in.
 All right. Take the flashlight.

23:38.593 --> 23:40.628
Okay.

24:12.527 --> 24:16.197
- Stop right there.
 - Whoa, whoa!

24:17.732 --> 24:19.600
Sheriff, what are you
 doing in my room?

24:19.700 --> 24:22.036
When's the last time
 you saw Tess Harding?
 Who?

24:22.136 --> 24:24.972
- Tess Harding,
 and don't lie to me!
 - I barely know the girl.

24:25.073 --> 24:27.842
- Then why'd you call
 her cell phone today?
 - She's a friend of Isabel's.

24:27.942 --> 24:30.278
I wanted to ask her advice
 on a birthday present.

24:30.378 --> 24:34.248
- and what did she tell you?
 - She said she was going to
 Jensen's to pick something up.

24:37.085 --> 24:39.320
That's what Kyle said.

24:39.420 --> 24:43.124
I knew I'd be on the dig all
 day
 and was pressed for time
 when she suggested flowers.

24:43.224 --> 24:45.259
She said purple Roses
 were Isabel's favorite.

24:45.359 --> 24:48.629
Sorry. Procedure.

24:48.729 --> 24:49.931
Procedure?

24:50.031 --> 24:52.667
You break into my room
 and stick a gun in my face?

24:52.767 --> 24:54.602
Tess harding is missing.

24:54.702 --> 24:57.572
Then maybe you should be out
 looking for her instead of
 harassing innocent people.

24:57.672 --> 25:00.041
Look, Mr. Sorenson--
 No, you look, sheriff.

25:00.141 --> 25:01.843
There's obviously
 no evidence.

25:01.943 --> 25:04.612
I don't appreciate you
 and deputy dawg here
 accusing me.

25:04.712 --> 25:07.115
- Nobody's accusing you
 of anything.
 - You got a search warrant?

25:07.215 --> 25:11.319
- I can get one.
 - Then get it.
 But until then, get out.

25:16.591 --> 25:19.393
If you hear from her,
 you call me.

 I'm talking about.
 Are you high or something?

Where'd you get that?
 From your file
 in Whitaker's office.

25:43.284 --> 25:45.353

 exactly what's going on.

No, I don't have
 to tell you anything.

Are you working with her?
 Are you spying on us?
 Is that what you're doing?

25:53.828 --> 25:57.098
You're a big man,
 aren't you?
 Don't jerk me around.

25:57.198 --> 26:00.468
If you're not working with
 Whitaker, then why does she
 have photos of you?

26:00.568 --> 26:03.271
Documents, huh?
 Why is she watching you?

26:03.371 --> 26:06.007
Why is a U.S. Congresswoman

Stepson.
 That's right.

26:11.112 --> 26:15.082
He screwed his life up with
 drugs, and I screwed
 my life up with him.

26:15.183 --> 26:17.418
When we got busted,
 do you know who
 went down for that?

26:17.518 --> 26:20.755
I spent two years in Buckman,
 and the only reason why
 I got out of there...

26:20.855 --> 26:23.858
is because I promised
 that bitch that I would
 never see him again.

26:23.958 --> 26:26.861
So I guess that
 she's just making sure
 that I keep that promise.

26:26.961 --> 26:29.931

Our limit is 50 years.

31:10.879 --> 31:13.148
My time is almost up.

31:13.248 --> 31:15.150
I'm going to find
 the granilith...

31:15.250 --> 31:18.153
if it's the last thing I do.
 I don't know
 what you're talking about.

31:18.253 --> 31:20.589
You're hiding it,
 the four of you.

31:20.689 --> 31:23.925
The royalty
 they tried to save
 by sending you here.

31:24.026 --> 31:26.895
You're going
 to help us.
 Never.

31:27.863 --> 31:31.333
You did before--
 You will again.

31:31.433 --> 31:34.803
You killed Nasedo,
 didn't you?
 To save you.

31:34.903 --> 31:38.073
From what?
 The other three.
 You belong with us.

31:38.173 --> 31:43.712
Our race.
 We're in charge now.

31:43.812 --> 31:45.714
Your kind
 doesn't rule anymore.

31:45.814 --> 31:48.116
I'm not one of you.
 [chuckles]

31:48.216 --> 31:51.319
you don't remember,
 do you?

31:52.754 --> 31:56.925
Let me give you
 a piece of history
 about your planet.

31:57.025 --> 32:02.864
Your name... was vilandra,
 and you were beautiful.

32:02.964 --> 32:05.400
Even more beautiful
 than you are now.

32:05.500 --> 32:07.869
You had a great love.

32:07.969 --> 32:11.640
And for him--

32:11.740 --> 32:14.576
for us--

32:14.676 --> 32:17.012
You betrayed your brother,
 your race.

32:17.112 --> 32:19.414
No.
 You sacrificed him.

32:19.514 --> 32:22.451
You sacrificed everyone,
 even yourself.

32:22.551 --> 32:25.220
And history, my dear,
 always repeats itself.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.355
God, you liar.
 We're leaving.

32:27.456 --> 32:31.660
- Tess, come on. Come here.
 - Not until you tell me where
 you're hiding the granilith.

32:31.760 --> 32:34.696
I told you before.
 I don't know what
 you're talking about.

32:34.796 --> 32:36.998
Maybe this will help
 jog your memory.

32:38.133 --> 32:39.601
Stop it!
 Stop hurting her!

32:39.701 --> 32:41.703
I'll stop
 when you tell me
 what I want to know.

32:47.109 --> 32:49.344
Come on.

32:52.814 --> 32:55.684
[screams]

33:40.362 --> 33:41.663
[MAX]
 Isabel!

33:47.335 --> 33:49.538
- Where's the granilith?
 - Get away from us!

33:49.638 --> 33:53.642
I'll destroy you.
 I'll destroy you all
 if I have to.

33:55.043 --> 33:58.380
No. Get away from us!

34:57.038 --> 34:59.341
What happened?

35:01.810 --> 35:04.713
It was Whitaker.
 She killed Nasedo.

35:07.415 --> 35:08.650
It's okay.

35:11.353 --> 35:12.621
No, it's not.

35:16.091 --> 35:17.626
It's not okay.

35:19.961 --> 35:21.997
I guess you were right
 about grant.

35:22.097 --> 35:24.466
I'm going to have
 to trust your instincts.

35:24.566 --> 35:28.536
I didn't know I was
 capable of this.

35:28.637 --> 35:31.206
You're getting stronger.

35:31.306 --> 35:32.574
We all are.

35:38.546 --> 35:40.815
Nasedo said we would.

35:41.750 --> 35:43.618
We have to protect
 each other.

35:43.718 --> 35:47.856
What you did for Tess,
 I know you would do
 for me...

35:47.956 --> 35:50.725
and I would do for you.

35:52.527 --> 35:54.562
No one can
 come between us.

35:56.898 --> 36:00.869
Max, she said things.
 What kind of things?

36:07.409 --> 36:09.911
Something about...
 a granilith.

36:14.983 --> 36:17.519
I know how I--

36:17.619 --> 36:19.721
after I used my powers
 on Pierce.

36:19.821 --> 36:24.893
So if you want
 to talk or something--

36:26.795 --> 36:28.863
I think I just need
 to be alone.

36:59.661 --> 37:01.629
Happy birthday, Isabel.

37:12.440 --> 37:15.377
I'm 18 today, mother.

37:16.011 --> 37:19.681
October 25.

37:19.781 --> 37:24.786
At least that's the day
 we've always celebrated
 as my birthday.

37:27.756 --> 37:32.360
But you're the only one
 who really knows the real day.

37:37.999 --> 37:41.336
I guess that's why I came to--
 to the place,

37:41.436 --> 37:45.607
the only place
 I've ever seen you.

37:46.941 --> 37:49.611
I hold--

37:49.711 --> 37:53.081
I hold on to that day,
 but you disappeared,

37:53.181 --> 37:58.053
and the picture of you
 is already fading,
 and it's all I have.

38:05.693 --> 38:08.763
I was so happy because
 you were beautiful and warm,

38:08.863 --> 38:11.966
and I even thought
 I looked like you.

38:14.102 --> 38:15.970
But it wasn't you.

38:16.071 --> 38:18.306
Not really.

38:18.406 --> 38:21.810
God, I don't know
 what you look like.

38:21.910 --> 38:23.945
Maybe I'll never know.

38:27.449 --> 38:28.683
It isn't fair.

38:32.353 --> 38:36.291
It isn't fair.
 I need you.

38:36.391 --> 38:37.792
I need you.

38:44.466 --> 38:46.668
Where are you?

38:46.768 --> 38:50.171
Oh, God, it's my birthday.
 We should be together.

38:50.271 --> 38:53.675
Why-- How could you leave us?

38:53.775 --> 38:56.244
How could you tell us those
 important information...

38:56.344 --> 38:59.948
about destinies
 and saving the world
 and then just disappear?

39:00.048 --> 39:02.951
Oh, God.

39:04.119 --> 39:08.456
I-- I killed a person.

39:09.190 --> 39:13.895
An enemy? An alien?

39:13.995 --> 39:15.663
Does that make it okay?

39:15.763 --> 39:19.234
Oh, God. What--
 what was she talking about?

39:19.334 --> 39:23.671
What was she talking about?
 She said I betrayed my family.

39:23.771 --> 39:26.341
Is it true?

39:26.441 --> 39:27.775
Oh, is it true?

39:30.078 --> 39:32.413
Am I a terrible person?

39:35.183 --> 39:36.885
Answer me.

39:36.985 --> 39:40.288
Answer me!

39:41.289 --> 39:43.925
Come on, answer me!

40:45.420 --> 40:47.655
The granilith.
