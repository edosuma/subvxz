02:23.710 --> 02:27.613
    Well, this is pretty much
  the grossest thing I've seen.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.784
    No, ma'am. It's actually
     a lot better than that.

02:32.786 --> 02:36.088
Let me, let me pull something up
   on my computer really fast.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.523
        Oh, there it is.

02:37.525 --> 02:40.859
      Um, did you know that
     nine out of ten doctors

02:40.861 --> 02:44.429
         recommend this
as the only way to quit smoking?

02:44.431 --> 02:46.932
    Can you hold on a second?
         Fuck you! Fuck!

02:46.934 --> 02:49.301
   Fuck you. Fuck you, fucker.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.136
           -Hey, Tim.
         -Oh, hey, Evan.

02:51.138 --> 02:52.471
   Have you guys put together
           the numbers

02:52.473 --> 02:54.006
 for Friday's presentation yet?

02:54.008 --> 02:55.374
       What presentation?

02:55.376 --> 02:57.609
           Phallusite.
    Phallusite presentation.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.845
         Oh, is that the
    bigger dick thing pill--

02:59.847 --> 03:02.881
-Natural male enhancement, yeah.
             -Right.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.716
   -Does that thing even work?
       -It totally works.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.352
-Heard it turns your junk green.
        -It still works.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.521
         Doesn't matter.
 It doesn't matter if it works.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.124
    All that matters is that
 we land the account, all right?

03:12.126 --> 03:16.061
 And then I can remove "acting"
   from acting sales manager.

03:16.063 --> 03:17.596
   Hmm, well, I'm on it, man.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.631
      -You can count on me.
           -Thank you.

03:21.568 --> 03:24.203
  Pick it up. Pick up the gun.

03:25.505 --> 03:27.472
         -They never...
              -Tim.

03:27.474 --> 03:29.741
              -Tim.
      -I'm on a sales call.

03:29.743 --> 03:32.544
         Ma'am, listen,
 if you're not gonna buy this--

03:32.546 --> 03:34.479
       -You're gonna die.
             -Shit!

03:34.481 --> 03:36.481
  Boo! Tagged your ass, pussy.

03:36.483 --> 03:38.483
  You, too? Mike, get to work.

03:38.485 --> 03:41.486
      -You owe me 50 bucks.
             -Shit!

03:43.423 --> 03:45.691
   Hey, can I borrow 50 bucks?

03:48.795 --> 03:51.797
 Hey, Evan. Sorry to be a nudge,
 but you wouldn't happen to have

03:51.799 --> 03:54.866
that $20 you owe me for the NCAA
   tournament pool, would you?

03:54.868 --> 03:56.435
    Yeah, yeah, sure. Sorry.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.670
      It's been such a bear
     collecting from people.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.272
 Kinda short on cash this month.

04:00.274 --> 04:02.708
    My cat has a cleft palate
      he needs surgery for.

04:02.710 --> 04:05.410
  He's constantly lapping milk
         into his eyes.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.979
       It's really tragic.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.385
     Okay, bada-bada-bada...

04:13.387 --> 04:14.853
   That's baseball, dumb ass.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.122
         Oh, I'm sorry.
     Did I fuck up the rules

04:17.124 --> 04:18.390
 of this incredibly well-defined
     and professional sport

04:18.392 --> 04:20.291
   that we just came up with?

04:20.293 --> 04:24.396
 Yeah, I'm just saying that this
 is clearly a basketball throw.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.632
       Okay, but I'm sure
 someone has thrown a baseball--

04:26.634 --> 04:28.133
      Yeah, nobody has ever
       thrown a baseball.

04:28.135 --> 04:29.901
  -In the history of baseball--
       -No adult male has.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.937
   In the history of baseball,
    major league baseball...

04:33.374 --> 04:36.074
      -Uh, can I help you?
   -Yes, thank you, actually.

04:36.076 --> 04:39.845
   I'm supposed to be working
    with Evan Sanders today.

04:39.847 --> 04:42.381
   -Yeah, he comes in at 9:30.
          -It's 10:45.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.016
       Look, look, you can
    actually see it vibrate.

04:44.018 --> 04:45.817
   Of course, because there's
     more than one element.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.186
         So is Evan here
  or should I grab a cubicle--

04:48.188 --> 04:49.421
        You'll know when
       he gets here, okay?

04:49.423 --> 04:51.223
           He'll start
      bugging you for shit.

04:51.225 --> 04:54.459
   Now, if you need something
  to do, you can get me coffee.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.161
 -Aren't you already drinking--
          -Hey, sport.

04:56.163 --> 04:57.663
You see that garbage over there?

04:57.665 --> 05:01.633
      Grab it and throw it
 in the dumpster in the garage.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.535
  Don't we have a good janitor
        who can do that?

05:03.537 --> 05:07.172
Yeah, well, his time's valuable.
            Goodbye!

05:07.174 --> 05:10.342
           -All right.
             -Byeee!

05:11.511 --> 05:13.545
       Don't waste those.

05:14.247 --> 05:16.281
     Five-five. This is it.

05:16.283 --> 05:17.683
        -That's the one.
        -This is the one.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.551
         -I can feel it.
           -All right.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.589
Yes!

05:52.118 --> 05:53.652
   Identify yourself, soldier.

05:53.654 --> 05:58.156
        Oh, uh, I'm Jack,
         the new intern.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.558
 I'm just taking out the trash.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.126
    -Don't we have a janitor?
            -You do.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.796
             -Jerry.
             -Frank.

06:05.998 --> 06:07.833
        Follow protocol.

06:10.169 --> 06:12.070
       It's my first day.

06:15.274 --> 06:16.608
     Thanks for pitching in.

06:47.774 --> 06:49.975
   -Screws up his equilibrium.
       -What's up, dildos?

06:49.977 --> 06:52.544
       Hey there, Andrew.
   Sorry to be a Pokety Paul,

06:52.546 --> 06:54.012
 but you wouldn't happen to have

06:54.014 --> 06:56.548
      that money you owe me
   for the NCAA pool, do you?

06:56.550 --> 06:58.517
   -Didn't I lose that thing?
      -It's not about that.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.852
It's about office fun.

07:00.854 --> 07:04.356
 My cat's got a cleft palate, is
 allergic to some types of air.

07:04.358 --> 07:05.824
           -Hey, Mike.
           -Fuck off!

07:05.826 --> 07:08.360
    All right. A little early
   for that kind of language,

07:08.362 --> 07:10.629
       but tomorrow works
       for me too, buddy.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.331
   -All right, well, see you.
         -See you, Dave.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.000
        Real nice, guys.

07:15.002 --> 07:17.035
  No one pays Dave, he's gonna
     stop running the pools.

07:17.037 --> 07:20.906
 No, he's not. It's the only way
  anyone ever talks to the guy.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.541
              Tim,

07:22.543 --> 07:25.343
   I thought you were working
 on the Phallusite presentation.

07:25.345 --> 07:27.279
       What's Phallusite?

07:27.281 --> 07:30.415
  You kidding me? Have you guys
      done any work today?

07:30.417 --> 07:31.817
               No.

07:32.985 --> 07:34.085
       AMANDA: Hey, boys.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.520
            ALL: Hey!

07:35.522 --> 07:39.257
      Damn! For head of HR,
     you look fucking sexy.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.226
       Too kind, too kind.

07:41.228 --> 07:44.896
   -Mandy, can we please talk?
      -Don't call me Mandy.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.001
  Andrew, how was your weekend?

07:50.003 --> 07:53.004
        Uh, it was good.
      I banged my neighbor.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.506
       Finally. All right!

07:54.508 --> 07:56.374
      You're talking about
    the hot Ukrainian chick?

07:56.376 --> 07:57.742
  Uh, it was actually her mom.

07:57.744 --> 08:00.645
  -That's decent. Proud of you.
             -Mandy.

08:00.647 --> 08:04.015
 Please, can we talk privately?
      Just somewhere else.

08:04.017 --> 08:07.452
          Why? This is
     a corporate break room.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.888
       Since we just have
    a business relationship,

08:09.890 --> 08:13.024
      then, whatever it is
   that you need to say to me,

08:13.026 --> 08:16.962
     you can say in front of
 all of our business associates.

08:16.964 --> 08:17.529
             Right?

08:18.998 --> 08:22.701
     Okay, fine. All right.
Look, what happened... What I...

08:22.703 --> 08:25.604
       I should have said,
         okay, is that--

08:25.606 --> 08:29.808
      Hey, congratulations
       on that NCAA pool.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.177
          Yeah, thanks.
 You know, I actually hate Duke,

08:32.179 --> 08:33.812
       but they win, so...

08:38.317 --> 08:40.652
           Well, uh...

08:41.754 --> 08:43.087
   You guys have a great day.

08:44.624 --> 08:47.893
   Except for you. Hope yours
  is a horrible piece of shit.

08:47.895 --> 08:51.696
-Well, not if yours isn't first.
             -Right.

08:52.798 --> 08:55.267
      Hey, I don't want to
       overstep my bounds,

08:55.269 --> 08:57.402
    but what the fuck! Jesus!

08:57.404 --> 08:59.004
 I don't want to talk about it.

08:59.006 --> 09:02.207
   Okay, that was just really
 uncomfortable, that was like--

09:02.209 --> 09:04.910
    I will. I know the story.
   I'll totally talk about it.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.616
      So, they're together.
  Just the two of them, right?

09:14.921 --> 09:16.588
              Evan.

09:18.124 --> 09:19.758
           I love you.

09:21.827 --> 09:23.261
               No.

09:28.935 --> 09:31.503
MIKE:  How could you
          just say no?

09:31.505 --> 09:33.538
         You could have
       said anything else,

09:33.540 --> 09:34.940
    like literally anything.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.542
   I can't even wrap my brain

09:37.544 --> 09:40.679
      around the way, like,
        you would say no.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.614
   Fire! This could have been
          the one time

09:42.616 --> 09:44.349
   -you could have said fire.
              -No.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.551
  Could've called her a bitch,
  that would have been better.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.520
     -Just silence, just...
              -No.

09:48.522 --> 09:50.522
      You could have spoken
           in tongues.

09:50.524 --> 09:53.592
You could have

09:53.594 --> 09:55.894
   -Not even English. German!
              <i>-Nein.</i>

09:55.896 --> 09:58.797
    I get it, okay. I get it.
          I understand.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.967
       Yes, I screwed up.
    I understand that, okay?

10:01.969 --> 10:05.670
 It just kind of came out, guys.
   I don't know what happened.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.572
       I just screwed up.

10:07.574 --> 10:08.807
     You did screw up, man.

10:08.809 --> 10:12.644
  She is the coolest girl ever.

10:12.646 --> 10:15.180
I mean, remember when she kicked
 all of our asses at paintball?

10:15.182 --> 10:18.817
 Why did she have all that camo
      on her face? Unreal.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.419
   Honestly, I bet dating her
      is like dating a guy.

10:21.421 --> 10:25.957
Who is like a hot chick that has
   a, you know, like a penis.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.127
         So, not a girl?

10:29.129 --> 10:33.632
  No, still a girl. Did you not
   listen to what I just said?

10:33.634 --> 10:35.166
           -All right.
      -No, it's a hot girl

10:35.168 --> 10:37.602
     with a beautiful penis
       but she's still...

10:37.604 --> 10:38.737
      She's still a chick.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.271
     She just has guy parts.

10:40.273 --> 10:43.742
  -I-I get where you're going.
     -It's a feminine penis.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.877
         What if it was
      a guy with a vagina?

10:45.879 --> 10:47.646
     He makes a good point.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.117
         -I'm an idiot.
             -Yeah.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.818
              Yeah.

10:53.820 --> 10:58.957
      You know, you and me,
     a couple of margaritas.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.593
      That is so offensive.

11:01.595 --> 11:03.028
     Why? That isn't racist.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.096
     I know it's not racist.
       I like margaritas.

11:05.098 --> 11:08.099
        I'm just offended
that you think I would date you.

11:09.503 --> 11:12.270
 Has anyone seen Andrew? Andrew!

11:12.272 --> 11:14.839
     Hey, Andrew, could you
     please get your phone?

11:14.841 --> 11:16.307
 It's ringing off the hook, man.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.810
     Oh, probably one of my

11:18.812 --> 11:22.480
   man-like 15 female suitors.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.315
   Your suitors are man-like?

11:24.317 --> 11:26.451
       No, no, no. I mean,
          man-like man!

11:26.453 --> 11:30.922
     Not man like man-like.
    You know, man like man--

11:30.924 --> 11:32.590
     Stop saying "man-like."

11:32.592 --> 11:35.760
    Could you get your phone?
   It's probably a sales call.

11:35.762 --> 11:38.063
   Probably a business-related
           sales call.

11:38.065 --> 11:42.600
          I'll give you
   the business-related later.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.402
     I'll talk to him, okay?

11:44.404 --> 11:48.773
    Uh, I heard what happened
with you and Amanda breaking up.

11:50.309 --> 11:51.543
    Oh, you heard about that?

11:51.545 --> 11:53.445
           Yeah, well,
      she's the head of HR,

11:53.447 --> 11:55.814
     and she put out a memo.

12:00.119 --> 12:02.721
           -Um, I-I--
           -All right.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.956
     Andrew, get the phone!

12:04.958 --> 12:08.460
   -Evan. Can I bend your ear?
           -Yeah. Hey.

12:08.462 --> 12:09.894
 How's the presentation coming?

12:09.896 --> 12:11.196
You're gonna be ready by Friday?

12:11.198 --> 12:14.666
          Yeah, Friday.
     Yeah, sure, Ted. Yeah.

12:14.668 --> 12:16.434
          Yeah, we need
       this account, Evan.

12:16.436 --> 12:17.902
      Sales have been bad,

12:17.904 --> 12:21.706
    but if we land this fish,
   you'll save all our asses.

12:21.708 --> 12:22.640
              Yeah.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.109
     I know male enhancement

12:24.111 --> 12:26.878
isn't the most glamorous product
       in the world but...

12:26.880 --> 12:30.648
     No. My sources tell me
       it works actually.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.083
  Tell me if you need anything,

12:32.085 --> 12:34.319
  'cause it's all hands on deck
          on this one.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.754
              Yeah.

12:35.756 --> 12:38.289
     I'm making a pretty big
       announcement toady

12:38.291 --> 12:40.892
     about the next phase of
      our company's future.

12:40.894 --> 12:43.528
      I need to know you're
     gonna be a team player,

12:43.530 --> 12:45.764
         no matter what.

12:45.766 --> 12:50.702
        Yeah. Yeah, Ted.
      You can count on me.

12:50.704 --> 12:52.437
     My office, 10 minutes.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.805
           All right.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.089
  Hey, guys. Guys, guess what?

13:11.091 --> 13:12.757
       I think Ted's gonna
     make me sales manager.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.759
            ALL: Oh!

13:14.761 --> 13:17.462
           Bam! Snap!

13:17.464 --> 13:18.863
              What?

13:20.232 --> 13:24.502
      Bam, snap. It's like,
  a new catchphrase I'm trying.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.939
 -Yeah, it's not really working.
    -It's a work in progress.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.541
           -I love it.
        -Thank you, Mike.

13:29.543 --> 13:30.909
        Yeah, yeah, yeah!

13:30.911 --> 13:32.410
      I'm still working on
      the inflection but...

13:32.412 --> 13:34.345
      -Ted's office in 10.
      -It's a catchphrase.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.014
      I feel like everyone
    needs one in the office.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.582
         -That's why...
    -Yeah, it's good though.

13:37.584 --> 13:41.152
  Yeah. We really need to start
    bringing fruit into this.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.054
         -We can eat it.
    -I'm not ready for fruit.

13:48.128 --> 13:51.296
   Hey, Amanda. Mandy. Amanda.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.431
 Uh, sorry. Sorry to bother you,

13:53.433 --> 13:56.467
     but Ted wants everyone
         in his office.

13:56.469 --> 13:59.904
    He's got an announcement
        to make, I guess.

13:59.906 --> 14:02.006
         -Okay, got it.
             -Okay.

14:04.076 --> 14:07.145
I think he's gonna make me
    sales manager.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.714
          -Is that so?
             -Yeah.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.449
   Finally get that promotion.

14:12.718 --> 14:14.919
        It's kinda crazy.
       I can't believe it.

14:14.921 --> 14:17.789
         It is so adult.
       Manager, you know?

14:17.791 --> 14:20.124
    I feel like it was just,
            you know,

14:20.126 --> 14:23.828
  yesterday when we were kids,
          just laughing

14:23.830 --> 14:27.165
  and just saying stupid stuff.

14:27.167 --> 14:32.503
            And now,
  we're looking after the kids.

14:32.505 --> 14:35.907
Right? You know, I was listening
      to NPR this morning.

14:35.909 --> 14:38.176
     They were talking about
    the monogamy of gibbons,

14:38.178 --> 14:41.980
 and it's just the cutest thing
         I've ever seen.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.415
 Or heard. It was on the radio,

14:44.417 --> 14:47.518
 but they had these sound bites,
        you know? They're

14:47.520 --> 14:51.623
  a little chirping, you know.
  These sweet monkey nothings--

14:51.625 --> 14:53.124
 Evan. I have some things to do.

14:53.126 --> 14:56.027
    -So if you'll excuse me.
    -Yeah, I'm gonna... Okay.

14:56.029 --> 14:59.130
       -Uh, check in five.
             -Right.

15:04.703 --> 15:08.539
      So, I'm sorry to say
   without major improvements,

15:08.541 --> 15:10.608
    we're gonna have to start
     laying some people off.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.076
Mike!

15:12.978 --> 15:15.380
     It's time for a change.

15:15.382 --> 15:21.085
Corporate  thinks we need
an official sales manager again.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.154
   And I couldn't agree more.

15:23.156 --> 15:27.091
    So I'm proud to announce
    our new manager of sales,

15:27.093 --> 15:29.193
          Max Phillips.

15:30.997 --> 15:33.965
      -No, no, no. Not Max.
      -Who the hell is Max?

15:33.967 --> 15:35.266
        What the hell is
       going on right now?

15:35.268 --> 15:37.268
         Max, Evan and I
    went to college together.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.770
   It's kind of a long story.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.338
- Hey, Evan.
-           -Sup?

15:40.340 --> 15:42.674
   -That wasn't a long story.
              -No.

15:42.676 --> 15:46.411
   Oh, did I mention that Max
  slept with Evan's girlfriend,

15:46.413 --> 15:48.846
   so Evan had Max kicked out
     of school for cheating,

15:48.848 --> 15:50.882
so Max punched Evan in the face?

15:50.884 --> 15:53.251
    No. You skipped all that.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.419
            Question.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.121
     -What do we sell here?
         -Shake weights.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.190
        -Power mustaches.
         -The Abinatrix.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.960
  No, Michael. We sell dreams.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.027
He knows my name.

16:03.029 --> 16:07.131
     Sales is... seduction.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.901
      And when you seduce,

16:09.903 --> 16:12.437
  do you say, "I have a 401k"?

16:12.439 --> 16:14.572
        Or "I floss"? No.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.008
           You say...

16:18.877 --> 16:21.012
          "I love you."

16:24.416 --> 16:26.951
       Because people make
    decisions from the heart.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.053
        If you wanna sell
     a bunch of useless crap

16:29.055 --> 16:31.289
    to fat losers in Alabama

16:31.291 --> 16:33.925
  and bored housewives in Iowa,

16:33.927 --> 16:36.861
       feed their dreams.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.629
         Convince them.

16:38.631 --> 16:43.468
  Their lives can transcend the
 pointless slog of being human.

16:43.470 --> 16:46.804
 Give them hope, open their eyes

16:46.806 --> 16:51.609
     to something... bigger.

16:51.611 --> 16:57.849
         Sink your teeth
 into their poor pathetic lives.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.151
       And give them life.

17:01.186 --> 17:04.122
And better abs.

17:04.124 --> 17:08.291
  Our goal for this month is...

17:09.828 --> 17:12.096
  one million dollars in sales.

17:12.098 --> 17:14.232
      It's aggressive, yes,

17:14.233 --> 17:16.634
but I'm confident we can hit it.

17:17.869 --> 17:21.739
   And if we don't, Ted and I
     have already agreed...

17:23.275 --> 17:25.542
         we'll be forced
       to kill all of you.

17:26.945 --> 17:28.780
 So you better do what he says.

17:31.116 --> 17:35.486
So, come on, let's get out there
        and get selling.

17:35.488 --> 17:38.489
      -What the hell, Ted?
     -Now, hold on a minute.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.224
           No one ever
     promised you that job.

17:40.226 --> 17:44.062
       Oh, yeah, I-I know,
        but Max Phillips?

17:44.064 --> 17:46.864
        He's got an MBA.
 He's got a great track record.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.232
  He comes highly recommended.

17:48.234 --> 17:51.302
        He has some very
interesting ideas for new hires.

17:51.304 --> 17:54.172
      Honestly, we're lucky
          to have him.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.609
    How did you... Of all...

17:58.611 --> 18:01.813
    Now, this isn't gonna be
     a problem, now, is it?

18:01.815 --> 18:04.782
      -You working for Max?
            -No. No!

18:04.784 --> 18:06.250
    Of course not, I just...

18:06.252 --> 18:08.719
       I would have liked
  a legitimate crack at the job

18:08.721 --> 18:11.756
      before you brought in
          someone else.

18:13.459 --> 18:17.662
     Look. I like you, Evan.
          I really do.

18:17.664 --> 18:20.631
       I mean, you show up
        for work on time.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.966
         You work hard.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.935
  You legitimately give a shit.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.970
        Thank you. I do!

18:25.972 --> 18:27.405
    It's like I used to tell
        the bench players

18:27.407 --> 18:28.706
  back when I coached football,

18:28.708 --> 18:30.541
   "The most important people
           in the team

18:30.543 --> 18:33.511
     "are the ones who make
       the starters try."

18:33.513 --> 18:36.214
     Now, you get out there.
          There you go.

18:47.025 --> 18:48.860
        Thank you, Jerry.

18:50.229 --> 18:52.230
          Those are the
   employee files I requested?

18:52.232 --> 18:54.866
      Oh, yes, I think so.

18:54.868 --> 18:57.201
   It might be helpful if you
   were a little more specific

18:57.203 --> 18:58.936
    about exactly what it is
       you're looking for.

18:58.938 --> 19:03.674
     Listen, Amanda, I know
  you and Evan have a history,

19:03.676 --> 19:06.777
         and I know that
       you care about him.

19:06.779 --> 19:10.481
    Uh... I'm the head of HR.

19:10.483 --> 19:14.051
  So, it's highly inappropriate
    for me to discuss this--

19:14.053 --> 19:15.920
        Sure, sure, sure.
       I'll tell you what.

19:17.157 --> 19:20.958
After I settle in, you and I can

19:20.960 --> 19:24.395
    schedule some one-on-one
   and get to know each other.

19:24.397 --> 19:27.064
     Yeah, that sounds nice.

19:27.066 --> 19:30.334
          -Hey, buddy.
             -Um...

19:30.336 --> 19:32.136
     Just a little HR talk.
         Thanks, Mandy.

19:32.138 --> 19:34.172
        -We'll circle...
       -Hey, that's my...

19:34.174 --> 19:36.240
      Where are you taking
          Fuzz Aldrin?

19:39.511 --> 19:41.979
 Fuzz Aldrin, the janitor has...
              Why?

19:41.981 --> 19:43.814
  Long time no see. Am I right?

19:47.920 --> 19:52.290
 Listen, Evan. I know you and I
    had a little falling out.

19:52.292 --> 19:55.026
  But as far as I'm concerned,

19:55.028 --> 19:57.461
     water under the bridge.

19:57.463 --> 19:59.197
        -Ancient history.
          -Okay, good--

19:59.199 --> 20:00.731
         It's all about
     the company now, right?

20:00.733 --> 20:03.334
             -Wait--
  -I knew I could count on you.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.002
         This is mine--

20:05.004 --> 20:08.573
     MIKE: Boom shaka laka.
   Who's the noob now, bitch?

20:08.575 --> 20:09.907
      Oh, now you wanna be
          a little kid.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.343
     Okay. Well, you can cry
         all night long

20:12.345 --> 20:14.879
       'cause you just got
  your ass whupped by a grownup

20:14.881 --> 20:16.514
      with a big-ass dick.

20:17.416 --> 20:20.551
       I'm gonna kill you.

20:36.268 --> 20:36.934
              Yeah.

20:38.270 --> 20:42.173
  Yeah. No, I'mma fuck you up.
        I'm gonna fuck...

20:42.175 --> 20:43.407
             you up.

20:43.409 --> 20:47.778
        Yeah, I see you.
     Fuckin' eat that shit.

20:47.780 --> 20:48.546
Hey.

20:50.148 --> 20:54.552
  Jesus, man! You gotta fucking
warn someone before you do that.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.254
     Office hours are over.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.823
           Yeah, well,
   high-speed internet's free,

20:58.825 --> 21:00.891
         and Elaine left
her Souplantation in the fridge.

21:00.893 --> 21:04.395
       So, velvet rope off
  this motherfucker right here

21:04.397 --> 21:07.098
    because this is gonna be
  my own personal club tonight.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.666
             -Okay.
              -Oh.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.534
   And I'm gonna be dialing up
          some Youjizz

21:10.536 --> 21:12.670
  and busting out some knuckle
 children in a couple of minutes

21:12.672 --> 21:15.539
  so unless you wanna mop me up
          here and here

21:15.541 --> 21:17.808
            and here
      and a little bit here

21:17.810 --> 21:19.910
      -and some over here--
  -I'll go take a smoke break.

21:24.082 --> 21:26.550
       Oh, yeah, I'm back.
     Oh, are the tears back?

21:26.552 --> 21:29.220
     Good. Yeah, take that.

21:29.222 --> 21:32.790
           Oh. Oh-ho.
I hear the tears already coming.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.799
         What the shit?

21:43.435 --> 21:45.436
  I'm gonna go take a dump now.

21:46.705 --> 21:48.873
 If anyone wanna steal something
       from this company,

21:48.875 --> 21:51.942
    I'd be gone way too long
    to do anything about it.

22:22.841 --> 22:23.941
               Ha.

22:23.943 --> 22:27.011
Hilarious, man.

22:27.013 --> 22:31.382
     Turning the lights out
 on the guy in the shitter, man.

22:31.384 --> 22:34.051
      You must be some kind
    of a prank savant, right?

22:42.260 --> 22:45.830
 All right, man. Whoever's doing
    this better knock it off.

23:20.265 --> 23:21.599
        Colonel Sanders.

23:21.601 --> 23:24.001
        Still hilarious.
   Hey, is Mike here already?

23:24.003 --> 23:26.570
   -His car is in the garage.
    -That's a negative, sir.

23:26.572 --> 23:28.539
    -Do you know who Mike is?
    -That's a negative, sir.

23:28.541 --> 23:29.740
 How do you know he's not here?

23:29.742 --> 23:31.208
   I unlocked the doors myself
            at 0600,

23:31.210 --> 23:33.611
       and no unfamiliars
  have penetrated my perimeter,

23:33.613 --> 23:34.745
    I've been on full alert.

23:38.183 --> 23:40.584
      So, full alert, huh?

23:43.622 --> 23:45.856
 I believe I know this cat, sir.

23:50.530 --> 23:55.433
        Okay, uh, at ease
          or carry on.

24:04.643 --> 24:05.876
    Nah, I must be dreaming.

24:07.412 --> 24:11.148
     Max called me at 6 a.m.
 this morning to come in early.

24:11.150 --> 24:14.952
  I haven't been up before dawn
  since straight is great camp

24:14.954 --> 24:16.587
              What?

24:16.589 --> 24:19.423
   I wasn't gay. They just had
 a really good archery program.

24:19.425 --> 24:21.125
  All right. So you've told me.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.260
   This situation sucks, dude.

24:23.262 --> 24:25.162
       I mean, we gotta do
  something about this, right?

24:25.164 --> 24:26.931
I mean, can you believe how much
    they've screwed us here?

24:26.933 --> 24:28.566
               Us?

24:28.568 --> 24:31.669
  Yeah. I mean, I was all ready
for you to become sales manager.

24:31.671 --> 24:33.504
   I wanted that for you, man.

24:33.506 --> 24:36.340
'Cause what's better than having
 your best friend as your boss?

24:36.342 --> 24:37.675
             -Yeah.
          -Now then...

24:37.677 --> 24:40.311
I mean, I would have gotten away
        with everything.

24:40.313 --> 24:41.812
           But now...

24:43.482 --> 24:45.316
    I mean, you get me, man.

24:45.318 --> 24:49.420
 You know? You allow me to be me
        in the workplace.

24:49.422 --> 24:51.155
        -Useless slacker.
            -Exactly.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.790
           -Worthless.
             -Yeah.

24:52.792 --> 24:56.193
        -Gotta have one.
    -I mean, look at me, man.

24:56.195 --> 24:57.528
           Look at me.

24:59.631 --> 25:03.100
       Our perfect routine
           is broken.

25:04.202 --> 25:08.539
       Yeah, you, you are
      the real victim here.

25:08.541 --> 25:09.139
             I know.

25:10.375 --> 25:14.845
          But hey, man.
    You got hosed too, kinda.

25:14.847 --> 25:15.913
               Oh.

25:16.448 --> 25:18.015
          By the way...

25:23.421 --> 25:24.889
               No.

25:24.891 --> 25:29.260
    No. You gotta be fucking
kidding me. This is my desk now?

25:29.262 --> 25:34.532
  Well, officially, it's still
     a photoprinter's desk.

25:34.534 --> 25:36.267
      But you can share it.

25:39.404 --> 25:41.238
        Do I get a chair?

25:52.351 --> 25:55.619
       Holy fucking shit!

25:58.224 --> 26:00.724
   We're gonna get this place
    lean and mean, Theodore.

26:00.726 --> 26:03.027
      We are gonna separate
    the meat from the tallow.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.495
          We're going--

26:04.497 --> 26:06.463
          Mike is dead.

26:06.465 --> 26:08.966
     -Mike is fucking dead!
             -What?

26:08.968 --> 26:10.801
          Mike is dead
    in the fucking bathroom.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.870
        I went in there,
     and someone ate his...

26:12.872 --> 26:15.673
 I don't know. I just had to go.
      I just needed to go.

26:15.675 --> 26:18.242
    Jesus Christ, I'll never
       take a shit again.

26:18.244 --> 26:22.346
     Evan, Evan, slow down.
         What's up now?

26:22.348 --> 26:23.681
             Mike...

26:24.549 --> 26:27.184
      He didn't... Dead...

26:27.186 --> 26:29.353
          The bathroom.

26:29.355 --> 26:30.888
       Ted, call security.

26:31.756 --> 26:33.791
       I still have to go.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.595
 -Hey, Frank , we have to have--
      -Code one emergency.

26:37.597 --> 26:42.166
  The forty dollars you owe me
  for the NCAA tournament pool.

26:42.168 --> 26:45.536
          I'd join ya,
  but I gotta get these papers.

26:45.538 --> 26:47.271
     Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

26:47.273 --> 26:48.806
      Don't open the door.

26:48.808 --> 26:52.509
     I'm-I'm sorry. I just,
       I need to warn you.

26:52.511 --> 26:56.280
       I hope you all have
        strong stomachs.

26:56.282 --> 26:57.748
- Oh, boy.

26:57.750 --> 27:01.685
       That's disgusting.
   I'll clean it again. It's--

27:01.687 --> 27:03.087
           What? No .

27:04.356 --> 27:08.425
 No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
             I-I...

27:08.427 --> 27:13.197
  I am telling you, this stall
   was a fucking horror show.

27:13.199 --> 27:14.999
    Evan, this isn't some way

27:15.001 --> 27:17.368
  of stalling on the Phallusite
      presentation, is it?

27:17.370 --> 27:21.605
        -The what? What?
  -The Phallusite presentation.

27:21.607 --> 27:23.374
         It's tomorrow.
      If you're not ready--

27:23.376 --> 27:24.975
        No, no. I just...
             I-I...

27:24.977 --> 27:27.745
   I'm not, I'm not ready yet,
      all right? I'm not...

27:27.747 --> 27:31.115
     It will be ready, okay?
           It will...

27:31.117 --> 27:33.283
             -Mike!
      -I'll deal with Mike

27:33.285 --> 27:36.286
       whenever he decides
    to roll in to work today.

27:36.288 --> 27:38.455
     You just keep your eye
        on the ball, huh?

27:38.457 --> 27:40.124
 We're counting on you, slugger.

27:46.965 --> 27:51.702
             No. No.
         What the fuck!

27:57.409 --> 27:59.076
   Permission to speak freely.

27:59.078 --> 28:02.579
Jesus Christ, Frank. Can we drop
 the whole chain of command bit?

28:02.581 --> 28:05.749
    I'm just not in the mood.

28:05.751 --> 28:08.986
         You were right.
    Someone drew first blood.

28:19.230 --> 28:21.031
     I need to talk to you.

28:21.033 --> 28:24.234
   Evan, if this is about us,
 I just can't at work. I have--

28:24.236 --> 28:25.602
          Mike is dead.

28:25.604 --> 28:27.271
              What?

28:27.273 --> 28:30.007
 I found him in the men's room.
 He was propped up in the stall

28:30.009 --> 28:32.309
 like some fucked up marionette.

28:32.311 --> 28:35.446
   There was blood everywhere.
  And then I went to get help,

28:35.448 --> 28:37.114
        and he was gone.

28:38.483 --> 28:41.351
   Oh, my God. I can't believe
  you're doing this right now.

28:41.353 --> 28:45.022
    Doing what? Mike was dead
        in the bathroom.

28:45.024 --> 28:46.657
  Did anyone else see the body?

28:46.659 --> 28:49.393
      Well, no. I-I-I went
           to get help

28:49.395 --> 28:50.994
   and then when I came back,
          he was gone.

28:50.996 --> 28:54.264
    Jesus! Evan, he's fucking
      with you. It's Mike.

28:54.266 --> 28:55.966
     He's probably doing it
           as a joke.

28:55.968 --> 28:59.436
        Let's not forget
 he's a complete asshole, okay?

28:59.438 --> 29:03.173
 Yeah, he is kind of an asshole,
      but I-I-I don't know.

29:03.175 --> 29:06.009
    -This looked pretty real.
             -Okay.

29:06.011 --> 29:09.646
   All right, let's, uh, let's
consider the possibilities then.

29:09.648 --> 29:12.616
           Option one,
     somebody murdered Mike,

29:12.618 --> 29:14.284
    left him in the bathroom
         and then moved

29:14.286 --> 29:15.919
     the body when you went
          to get help.

29:15.921 --> 29:17.588
Well, when you put it that way--

29:17.590 --> 29:21.892
 Or option two is that the most
  obnoxious prick in the office

29:21.894 --> 29:25.129
  who would rather do anything
    other than actually work,

29:25.131 --> 29:27.831
 played a practical joke on you.

29:27.833 --> 29:29.233
  Okay, now I'm gonna kill him.

29:29.235 --> 29:32.503
     Yeah, well, you've got
       bigger fish to fry.

29:32.505 --> 29:34.238
  Okay, Max is cleaning house.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.974
 Mike was probably getting fired
  even before the first stunt.

29:40.245 --> 29:42.746
         I have to nail
       that presentation.

29:42.748 --> 29:44.081
              Yeah.

29:47.820 --> 29:50.454
      Thank you. Thank you.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.089
      -Hup, hup, hup, hup.
      -Hup, hup, hup, hup.

29:52.091 --> 29:53.223
       Don't you two have
        some work to do?

29:53.225 --> 29:54.758
          -Not really.
          -Not really.

29:54.760 --> 29:57.127
      -Hup, hup, hup, hup.
      -Hup, hup, hup, hup.

29:59.564 --> 30:01.098
          -Dave, right?
             -Yeah.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.267
      I hear you're the guy
 to talk to about office pools.

30:03.269 --> 30:05.202
             -Yeah.
      -Company sports czar.

30:05.204 --> 30:07.037
  It's so weird. I have to try
          to get people

30:07.039 --> 30:08.539
  -to call me that around here.
           -Oh, yeah?

30:08.541 --> 30:11.341
 I should probably quit though.
       My cat, Puddles, he

30:11.343 --> 30:13.544
gets really jealous when I spend
        too much time on,

30:13.546 --> 30:14.711
   his diabetes is acting off.

30:14.713 --> 30:16.146
          Oh, nonsense.

30:16.148 --> 30:19.283
  Morale is vital to the health
         of any company.

30:19.285 --> 30:21.351
          And you make
   an important contribution.

30:21.353 --> 30:23.554
 Let's pop into my man-cave, and
 you can give me the Vegas tips

30:23.556 --> 30:26.690
  on the NBA playoffs and dirt
  on upcoming events, you know?

30:26.692 --> 30:28.392
          Don't hit me.

30:28.394 --> 30:29.359
      Man stuff, all right.

30:29.361 --> 30:30.761
           -All right.
            -Come on.

30:30.763 --> 30:32.696
    I got all sorts of ideas
     for other office pools.

30:32.698 --> 30:36.233
      Competitive curling,
  fantasy fishing, ant bite...

30:36.235 --> 30:37.901
      -Hup, hup, hup, hup.
      -Hup, hup, hup, hup.

30:37.903 --> 30:39.403
      -Hup, hup, hup, hup.
      -Hup, hup, hup, hup.

30:39.405 --> 30:41.104
      -Hup, hup, hup, hup.
      -Hup, hup, hup, hup.

30:41.106 --> 30:42.806
      -Hup, hup, hup, hup.
      -Hup, hup, hup, hup.

30:42.808 --> 30:44.775
        Dude, the record.

30:44.777 --> 30:46.109
         What's up, man.
         You all right?

30:47.445 --> 30:48.312
              I...

30:49.280 --> 30:50.848
   I don't know. I don't know.

30:52.116 --> 30:56.220
       Right now, I'm just
 trying to avoid getting fired.

30:56.222 --> 30:58.388
          That's smart.
       That's a good plan.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.290
  -Welcome to the club, right?
             -Right.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.759
      -Hup, hup, hup, hup.
      -Hup, hup, hup, hup.

31:02.761 --> 31:04.161
        -Hup, hup, hup--
        -Hup, hup, hup--

31:09.167 --> 31:12.269
          I want my $20
  for the NCAA tournament pool.

31:12.271 --> 31:15.105
     -I told you, man. I...
          -No excuses!

31:15.107 --> 31:17.107
     You gambled, you lost.

31:17.109 --> 31:19.209
   Now pay for your failures.

31:19.211 --> 31:20.577
  You need to chill out, Brian.

31:20.579 --> 31:24.581
    I will chill when I have
     your $20 as well, Tim.

31:24.583 --> 31:28.418
    You have until 5 o'clock.
  Don't make me come find you.

31:28.420 --> 31:32.155
    Evan, thank you for your
 thoughtful and prompt payment.

31:32.157 --> 31:34.091
   It shall not be forgotten.

31:35.693 --> 31:37.027
              I...

31:39.931 --> 31:41.698
     What the fuck was that?

31:41.700 --> 31:43.300
       I didn't even enter
           that pool.

31:43.302 --> 31:47.337
   Ah, shit. Mike's computer's
       password protected.

31:47.339 --> 31:48.739
  That's probably a good thing.

31:48.741 --> 31:50.474
    There's an insane amount
        of porn on that.

31:50.476 --> 31:50.908
              Uh...

31:52.343 --> 31:54.177
   How the hell am I gonna get
      those sales figures?

31:54.179 --> 31:56.813
       You mean, you want
    all the numbers, like...

31:56.815 --> 31:59.650
  Yeah, yeah. The spreadsheets
     are on Mike's computer

31:59.652 --> 32:00.851
     and that's locked, so--

32:00.853 --> 32:02.219
Oh, you don't have the password?

32:02.221 --> 32:04.821
    No, no. You know, I don't
    wanna know the password,

32:04.823 --> 32:07.691
  so I'm gonna have to rebuild
  the excel files from scratch.

32:07.693 --> 32:10.260
     Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can
     totally help, you know.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.095
      Especially after what
         Ted did to you.

32:12.097 --> 32:13.730
   That was just so horrible.

32:13.732 --> 32:15.632
      I know. Right? Yeah.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.334
       You must be having
      such a horrible day.

32:17.336 --> 32:18.702
          So you think
      you can help me out?

32:18.704 --> 32:20.237
     Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:20.239 --> 32:23.507
     I could totally go down
   to the basement, and, um...

32:23.509 --> 32:25.642
    -grab the files for you.
         -That's great.

32:25.644 --> 32:29.179
 You're a lifesaver, Zabs. Go-go
  do that, and then we'll talk.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.081
             - Okay
        -  <i>Okay. Bye-bye.</i>

32:31.083 --> 32:32.516
         Bye. Run along.

32:32.518 --> 32:34.117
      -Hup, hup, hup, hup.
      -Hup, hup, hup, hup.

32:34.119 --> 32:35.686
         -Hup, hup, hup.
         -Hup, hup, hup.

32:36.822 --> 32:38.488
              -God.
       -MAN: Little help.

32:42.694 --> 32:44.294
          Really? Uh...

32:45.196 --> 32:46.430
               Oh!

32:56.574 --> 32:58.108
            Ev-Evan?

33:00.712 --> 33:02.546
Okay.

33:05.183 --> 33:06.750
Oh, shit.

33:06.752 --> 33:09.419
     I just got this skirt.

33:09.421 --> 33:10.620
            Come on.

33:15.227 --> 33:17.527
   Please, it's not the world.
      It's just one night.

33:17.529 --> 33:18.729
        I have kick ball.

33:18.731 --> 33:19.930
       And you're starting
        pitcher tonight.

33:19.932 --> 33:21.832
        I'm on that team.
       I never get to go.

33:21.834 --> 33:23.633
         -He's terrible.
         -God damn, Tim!

33:23.635 --> 33:25.535
   All right. Wh-what do I get
           if I stay?

33:25.537 --> 33:26.703
      My undying gratitude.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.905
   The respect and admiration
         of your peers.

33:28.907 --> 33:30.440
         - It's not me.
         - Come on, man.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.943
      - Something valuable.
        - Precious gems.

33:32.945 --> 33:34.311
        Straight-up cash.

33:34.313 --> 33:36.113
     If we land the account,
       all the Phallusite

33:36.115 --> 33:37.948
     you'll ever need, free.

33:37.950 --> 33:39.116
              - No.
             - Yes.

33:39.118 --> 33:40.817
              - No.
             - Yes.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.486
    - You should be in sales.
             - Yes!

33:43.855 --> 33:45.389
        Why do you care?
              I...

33:45.391 --> 33:48.592
    I don't suppose I should
     even bother to ask you.

33:48.594 --> 33:51.561
  Oh, I can't tonight. I've got
     Kelly Clarkson tickets.

33:51.563 --> 33:52.763
        Oh, you had been
       talking about that.

33:52.765 --> 33:54.264
             - Yeah.
          - All right.

33:54.266 --> 33:57.200
   I like that <i>Walk Away</i> song,
          though, I do.

33:57.202 --> 33:58.668
Boom!

33:58.670 --> 34:01.238
         Nuh! Aww, man!

34:02.006 --> 34:04.107
  There goes all the burritos.

34:04.109 --> 34:06.176
  This is a conventional oven,
             right?

34:06.178 --> 34:07.711
         Well, you know,

34:07.713 --> 34:12.315
     microwaving is a pretty
   inexact science, Tim, so...

34:12.317 --> 34:16.152
         You know what?
         Can I be blunt?

34:16.155 --> 34:17.587
        As opposed to how
        you normally are?

34:17.589 --> 34:21.324
  So how long are you planning
       on punishing Evan?

34:21.326 --> 34:24.460
  Jesus, Tim. I am not talking
  to you about this right now.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.295
      Yes, you are, Mandy.
            Damn it.

34:26.297 --> 34:28.431
        We are gonna have
  this conversation right now.

34:28.434 --> 34:31.068
     Because, you know what?
       Evan is a good guy.

34:31.070 --> 34:33.637
          You know it.
      I know it. All right.

34:33.639 --> 34:35.605
     So he made one mistake.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.507
          - He's human.
         - Yeah, well...

34:37.509 --> 34:40.010
         It was a pretty
        big mistake, Tim.

34:40.012 --> 34:42.379
   What do you want me to say?

34:42.380 --> 34:46.716
           Okay, yeah.
     Evan hurt my feelings.

34:49.320 --> 34:53.824
  Yeah, I guess that's exactly
    what I wanted you to say.

34:53.826 --> 34:54.658
          You said it.

34:54.659 --> 34:56.159
           Well, yeah.

34:56.161 --> 34:59.830
      Look, I'm not trying
 to pile on to you emotionally,

34:59.832 --> 35:01.131
             Right.

35:01.133 --> 35:02.399
     but look, we all think
         you're awesome.

35:02.401 --> 35:05.202
    Yup, yup. Awesome Amanda.

35:05.204 --> 35:06.937
Dating me is like dating a dude.

35:06.939 --> 35:10.841
      - It's really great.
 - Never heard anyone say that.

35:12.710 --> 35:17.080
  It's not like I was expecting
    a fucking proposal, okay?

35:17.082 --> 35:20.350
 And this may not have occurred
   to you, but it was actually

35:20.352 --> 35:24.054
     really difficult for me
           to even say

35:24.056 --> 35:25.489
          the "L" word,

35:25.491 --> 35:28.959
     and please, do not make
    a lesbian joke right now.

35:28.961 --> 35:31.027
    That seems inappropriate.
   I wouldn't have done that.

35:31.029 --> 35:32.796
 You always make lesbian jokes.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.264
    Not in front of lesbians.

35:35.399 --> 35:38.869
       Or women, you know,
     with lesbian haircuts.

35:38.871 --> 35:39.402
              Look.

35:40.938 --> 35:43.874
   I wasn't even expecting him
   to say it back right away.

35:43.876 --> 35:47.077
      But Jesus, Tim. "No?"

35:47.079 --> 35:48.545
            Oh, yeah.

35:48.547 --> 35:53.216
   He said no. Like what kind
     of a response is that?

35:53.218 --> 35:56.753
      -Not a positive one.
             -Yeah.

35:56.755 --> 35:57.254
        It would have...

35:58.789 --> 36:01.858
It would have honestly hurt less
   if he just would have said

36:01.860 --> 36:03.426
         nothing at all.

36:05.930 --> 36:07.430
           Hey, Evan.

36:08.933 --> 36:11.501
         TIM: Hmm, shit.

36:11.503 --> 36:14.704
     Mandy is upset because
   I was using the microwave,

36:14.706 --> 36:17.174
  and I just didn't understand
      how the buttons work,

36:17.176 --> 36:21.578
  and I blew up my burrito, and
  it was, like, the fourth one.

36:21.580 --> 36:25.348
     She wanted to microwave
    her salad, I think and...

36:25.350 --> 36:27.784
   -We were talking about you.
            -Clearly.

36:27.786 --> 36:29.519
          Amanda Baron.

36:29.521 --> 36:33.790
  Your friends call you Mandy,
 but Amanda is better, stronger.

36:33.792 --> 36:39.229
     A name with fingernails
  I can dig into a man's back.

36:39.231 --> 36:41.097
              Um...

36:41.099 --> 36:43.867
    interesting observation.

36:46.304 --> 36:49.239
          I smell lust.

36:50.341 --> 36:54.110
      I can hear your heart
           all broken.

36:54.112 --> 36:55.946
            And wet.

36:55.948 --> 36:58.348
   That's really weird, okay?

36:58.350 --> 37:00.383
    Evan doesn't deserve you.

37:01.385 --> 37:03.853
      Perhaps you just need
        a woman's touch.

37:05.590 --> 37:07.624
   Shouldn't you be answering
           the phones?

37:10.461 --> 37:12.229
       I like your dress.

37:19.003 --> 37:20.770
 No money was ever transferred.

37:20.772 --> 37:23.406
  You can't just give yourself
          a checkmark.

37:23.408 --> 37:26.009
 I put a checkmark on the board.
       That's a sale, man.

37:33.517 --> 37:35.518
    Tick-tock, motherfucker.

37:43.394 --> 37:46.730
            Yes. Yes,
    you can borrow 20 bucks.

37:46.732 --> 37:47.297
             Quick.

37:48.599 --> 37:51.935
     So please, just give me
  your address and your e-mail

37:51.937 --> 37:55.472
    and your Social Security,
      and I'll send it out.

37:57.008 --> 37:58.341
            Go ahead.

37:59.410 --> 38:02.312
One...

38:02.314 --> 38:06.549
          Five o'clock.
    See you fuckers tomorrow.

38:06.551 --> 38:09.719
       Oh, did anybody see
      which way Dave went?

38:17.094 --> 38:20.030
  Hey, but I gave you 20 bucks.

38:31.809 --> 38:33.576
             -Evan?
              -Oh.

38:33.578 --> 38:35.445
       Oh. Hi, Elaine, hi.

38:36.547 --> 38:39.482
 Sorry. Sorry you lost your job.

38:40.618 --> 38:41.785
               Oh.

38:50.394 --> 38:51.928
     Oh, thank you, Elaine.

38:54.532 --> 38:56.333
         All right, man.
  Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

38:56.335 --> 38:57.867
           Phallusite.

38:59.470 --> 39:01.404
   Well, it was worth a shot.

39:05.043 --> 39:09.813
And you can call me Ward Cleaver
 'cause I just banged out June.

39:09.815 --> 39:11.081
              Nice.

39:11.083 --> 39:15.985
    You can call me Uncle Ben
   because I just nailed May.

39:15.987 --> 39:17.487
              Nice.

39:17.489 --> 39:20.957
      Hey, we keep this up,
we might not have to sleep here.

39:20.959 --> 39:22.625
       Oh, Amen, brother.

39:25.329 --> 39:28.131
            Oh shit.

39:28.133 --> 39:30.834
     Zabeth only brought up
  the hard copies through July.

39:30.836 --> 39:33.236
     Can you run downstairs
         and get August?

39:33.238 --> 39:34.337
        In the basement?

39:34.339 --> 39:35.939
             -Yeah.
            -Oh, man.

39:35.941 --> 39:38.575
  That place has freaked me out
   ever since they found that

39:38.577 --> 39:39.943
      whimsical gimp mask.

39:39.945 --> 39:42.812
   You know, Elaine walked off
           with that.

39:42.814 --> 39:46.416
 Come on, man. Please. Just go.
  Think of it as a field trip.

39:46.418 --> 39:48.351
     You don't have to work
         for one minute.

39:48.353 --> 39:51.187
     Actually, that's pretty
         good argument.

39:51.189 --> 39:52.856
          There you go.

40:01.532 --> 40:05.935
    Ooh, no, no, no, no, no.
       Don't do it, Evan.

40:08.139 --> 40:08.605
            Bad idea.

40:10.174 --> 40:14.244
 Ah, fuck that. It was my office
     longer than it was his.

40:19.885 --> 40:24.821
    Oh, Jesus Christ, Zabeth.
 You scared the shit out of me.

40:24.823 --> 40:27.424
   What the hell were you even
        doing down here?

40:31.695 --> 40:35.165
      Oh, shit. Of course.

40:37.002 --> 40:38.902
          Um, ass-hat?

40:41.306 --> 40:46.342
  I thought perhaps it was Evan
   coming down, but now I see.

40:46.344 --> 40:48.845
         Why send a boy
       to do a man's job?

40:48.847 --> 40:51.247
  Well, I couldn't agree more.

40:51.249 --> 40:52.582
       The douche-nozzle.

40:54.252 --> 40:56.586
Yeah, I should stop doing that.

40:56.588 --> 40:59.489
     You know, I always had
     a thing for you, right?

40:59.491 --> 41:01.157
            - Really?
            - Mm-hmm.

41:01.159 --> 41:05.195
   'Cause I always thought you
 wanted me to die in a car fire.

41:05.197 --> 41:08.832
  Oh, no, no, no, no. Why would
 my baby think of me like that?

41:08.834 --> 41:13.570
   Because you said, "Andrew,
 I hope you die in a car fire."

41:15.973 --> 41:18.107
    Got some new hires, huh?

41:19.810 --> 41:21.678
  Well, that's not a surprise.

41:21.680 --> 41:26.216
  You were very specific to the
  make, the model, the mileage.

41:26.218 --> 41:28.585
     Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

41:28.587 --> 41:31.354
   I was just wasting my time
         pining on Evan.

41:31.356 --> 41:34.724
     And Evan is just that.

41:34.726 --> 41:35.892
            A waste.

41:40.264 --> 41:43.666
     Oh, Max. You sick fuck.

41:43.668 --> 41:46.503
         Okay, come on.
        Evan's my friend,

41:46.505 --> 41:48.738
    and he's the only person
      in this office who...

41:48.740 --> 41:51.441
             - Aah!
 - You're right. Fuck that guy.

41:51.443 --> 41:53.042
      Well, Tim. I mean...

41:53.944 --> 41:55.545
          What? Really?

41:56.547 --> 41:58.548
     Oh, what are you doing?
            How do...

42:00.384 --> 42:01.551
             Well...

42:02.553 --> 42:05.955
    What? I'm the one person
          in the office

42:05.957 --> 42:08.157
 you haven't made a decision on.

42:09.293 --> 42:10.860
     Okay, full disclaimer.

42:10.862 --> 42:13.162
   There might be some slight
discoloration issues down there,

42:13.164 --> 42:15.331
but if it helps, you can pretend
     you're boning the Hulk.

42:15.333 --> 42:16.799
     Actually, I don't want
      to over promise that.

42:16.801 --> 42:18.368
      Let's go with Kermit.

42:18.370 --> 42:20.203
             Ho-ha!

42:20.205 --> 42:22.772
     Huh! Well, well, well.

42:23.874 --> 42:28.811
      My buddy Ted will be
    very interested in this.

42:28.813 --> 42:31.514
 I have severely underestimated
         the versatility

42:31.516 --> 42:33.550
      of Anne Taylor Loft.

42:35.519 --> 42:37.887
    Oh, God! You bit my lip.

42:37.889 --> 42:39.722
Do we need a safe word?
          Oh!

42:39.724 --> 42:41.424
         Scream for me.

42:41.426 --> 42:44.360
      Okay. You know what?
  I'm as kinky as the next guy.

42:48.299 --> 42:50.033
     Well, you have Zabeth.

42:51.001 --> 42:52.168
            Oh, God!

42:52.170 --> 42:54.270
          Okay, I took
 a self-defense class for women

42:54.272 --> 42:57.507
 to pick up chicks, and the shit
 they teach you there is nasty.

42:57.509 --> 43:00.109
 Dave? What the hell does he do?

43:00.111 --> 43:03.646
   No! Foot stomp, eye gouge,
          crotch kick.

43:03.648 --> 43:05.715
- Excellent suggestion.
          -Ah!

43:11.388 --> 43:12.822
     Well, that's different.

43:21.231 --> 43:22.532
            Oh, God!

43:22.534 --> 43:25.268
      I will still fuck you
         if you scream.

43:25.270 --> 43:26.736
  What the hell does that mean?

43:26.738 --> 43:29.739
Oh, God!

43:29.741 --> 43:31.674
     I just didn't say when.

43:36.180 --> 43:37.714
         All right, Max.

43:38.816 --> 43:42.385
       We'll see what Ted
     has to say about this.

43:45.990 --> 43:50.360
       Oh, man, you would
      not believe what I...

43:50.362 --> 43:54.998
   Are you... Son of a bitch!
     If you bailed on me...

44:00.037 --> 44:01.704
             Andrew?

44:03.707 --> 44:07.910
    Dude, if this is another
   fucking bit like Mike's...

44:07.912 --> 44:10.613
              -Run.
       -Whoa, whoa, whoa!

44:10.615 --> 44:13.883
Oh, shit! Andrew, you all right?

44:13.885 --> 44:16.653
      Okay, okay, hold on.
       I'm gonna get help.

44:58.462 --> 45:00.997
   What the fuck is happening?

45:03.834 --> 45:06.869
 Somebody here went to Harvard?

45:19.583 --> 45:22.185
   Who the fuck would do this?

45:27.224 --> 45:28.357
              Max.

45:31.395 --> 45:36.766
    Max. You fucking asshole.

46:11.268 --> 46:12.769
            Oh fuck!

46:16.874 --> 46:18.775
           Oh, come on

46:21.812 --> 46:23.980
    Amanda. Amanda, it's me.
       I'm at the office.

46:23.982 --> 46:25.481
  I just saw Andrew get killed.

46:25.483 --> 46:28.384
    And now they're after me,
      and I think it's Max.

46:28.386 --> 46:31.154
      MAX: <i>Oh, gosh, buddy.</i>
     <i>That hurts my feelings.</i>

46:31.156 --> 46:34.323
    I'm sure Amanda is great
          in a crisis,

46:34.325 --> 46:37.527
       but don't you think
this call is more suited to 911?

46:37.529 --> 46:38.895
 What have you done with Amanda?

46:38.897 --> 46:43.332
       I just devoured her
        fabulous Ossobuco

46:43.334 --> 46:46.402
     Who knew Mandy was such
     a demon in the kitchen?

46:46.404 --> 46:51.240
 Absolutely open another bottle
      as long as it's red.

46:51.242 --> 46:52.408
              What?

46:55.012 --> 46:57.980
    Max, you son of a bitch.
  You listen to me, right now!

46:59.150 --> 47:02.151
           -Oh, fuck!
       -Do I hear banging?

47:02.153 --> 47:05.454
 On your end. I mean, there's no
  banging happening here, yet.

47:07.425 --> 47:09.492
   Wait, are you on my phone?

47:09.494 --> 47:11.060
  It's Evan calling to tell us

47:11.062 --> 47:14.730
     <i>he's absolutely crushing</i>
    <i>the presentation tomorrow.</i>

47:14.732 --> 47:15.798
   Do you want to talk to him?

47:17.569 --> 47:21.571
     Uh, no. No, it's okay.

47:22.372 --> 47:23.639
Amanda!

47:23.641 --> 47:24.974
          Sorry, buddy.
      You're stuck with me.

47:26.878 --> 47:29.078
        God damn it, Max.
         I swear to God

47:29.080 --> 47:30.947
 if you lay one finger on her...

47:32.383 --> 47:35.318
    I think you better focus
   on your own problems, bro.

47:35.320 --> 47:36.752
But I'll give Amanda your best.

47:38.623 --> 47:41.023
  Actually, I'll give her mine.

47:41.025 --> 47:43.893
            -Max, no.
          -It's better.

47:45.329 --> 47:47.964
           Max! Fuck!

47:47.966 --> 47:52.468
      Fuck! Fuck-ety fuck!
              Fuck!

47:54.405 --> 47:57.073
       Situation is suited
          for 911, huh?

48:01.112 --> 48:03.679
    Fuck it. That was stupid.

48:05.483 --> 48:07.583
    All right. Where were we?

48:07.585 --> 48:10.019
         "Where are we?"

48:10.988 --> 48:13.189
           Is the more
       pertinent question.

48:14.524 --> 48:16.559
             -What?
             -You...

48:18.028 --> 48:20.062
      have beautiful eyes.

48:25.636 --> 48:28.237
   Uh, we should get started.

48:28.239 --> 48:31.073
    We have the whole company
      to get through, so...

48:33.911 --> 48:35.912
        Don't I know it.

48:47.824 --> 48:49.825
Ah!

48:49.827 --> 48:53.496
         Hey, Ted. Oww.

48:53.498 --> 48:55.498
    Mind explaining yourself?

48:55.500 --> 48:56.565
           Ted's here.

48:56.567 --> 48:59.969
      I, uh, I don't know.
          I don't know.

48:59.971 --> 49:03.306
       I, uh, was working
      on the presentation.

49:03.308 --> 49:06.075
            And uh...
       Oh, my God! Andrew!

49:06.077 --> 49:07.610
 "Oh, my God, Andrew," is right.

49:07.612 --> 49:09.779
  Without him, today would have
     been a total disaster.

49:09.781 --> 49:12.248
  What? No, no. Andrew is dead.

49:12.250 --> 49:15.284
        Dead tired after
        that all-nighter.

49:15.286 --> 49:19.355
        The presentation.
 Signed, sealed, and delivered.

49:19.357 --> 49:23.392
   Andrew, you start prepping
  my office for the Phallusite.

49:23.394 --> 49:25.828
        I want you to run
    this presentation today.

49:25.830 --> 49:27.363
        You got it, boss.

49:27.365 --> 49:28.564
             Bounce.

49:29.733 --> 49:32.234
       Evan, what the hell
        happened to you?

49:32.236 --> 49:35.171
       You've always been
   a model employee, but I...

49:35.173 --> 49:38.841
       I can't overlook a
 pooch-screwing this monumental.

49:38.843 --> 49:41.177
         Ted. Ted, Ted.

49:41.812 --> 49:43.446
       Let's not be hasty.

49:43.448 --> 49:47.650
   Andrew finished the job but
 Evan laid down the groundwork.

49:47.652 --> 49:49.285
    Look at this poor fellow.

49:49.287 --> 49:51.354
     He was just passed over
        for a promotion.

49:51.356 --> 49:52.989
 He slept in the supply closet,

49:52.991 --> 49:54.824
       and he smells like
      a dead wharf hooker.

49:54.826 --> 49:58.027
       -You smell it now?
-He's just having a rough patch.

49:58.029 --> 50:00.096
         Let's give him
    a pass on this one, okay?

50:02.466 --> 50:04.100
              I...

50:09.806 --> 50:11.540
     Max brought doughnuts.

50:17.180 --> 50:19.548
    I would love to tell you
 about our exceptional product,

50:19.550 --> 50:23.252
           Abinatrix.
   Abinatrix is 100% natural.

50:23.254 --> 50:26.889
    Abinatrix is for everyone
          of all ages.

50:26.891 --> 50:29.692
     Dude, that sucked man.

50:31.094 --> 50:33.596
    Abinatrix is recommended
        by most doctors.

50:33.598 --> 50:36.565
     No, I don't understand
   what the hell is going on.

50:36.567 --> 50:40.102
        I did not imagine
 all that stuff last night, Tim.

50:40.104 --> 50:42.638
        And why the hell
      did Max save my job?

50:42.640 --> 50:44.707
       You know what, man?
  I thought that was weird too,

50:44.709 --> 50:46.409
      but on the plus side,

50:46.411 --> 50:50.246
at least he didn't turn you into
  a vampire like everyone else.

50:50.248 --> 50:51.447
           Mom, look,
  just buy Abinatrix all right?

50:51.449 --> 50:53.082
              What?

50:53.084 --> 50:55.618
 I haven't had a sale all month
   and I'm going to get fired.

50:55.620 --> 50:57.920
 Dude, what are you doing? That
 was going to be my first sale.

50:57.922 --> 51:00.956
         Tim! Vampires?

51:00.958 --> 51:03.392
         Oh, okay. Well,

51:03.394 --> 51:06.328
it's just a few things I've been
    noticing here and there.

51:11.968 --> 51:13.569
             A shoe?

51:15.205 --> 51:19.041
    -That was your evidence?
    -Well, I'm not done yet.

51:28.118 --> 51:30.653
          Okay, that is
      significantly weirder

51:30.655 --> 51:33.089
           and Zabeth
   has been acting strangely.

51:33.091 --> 51:36.025
     Agreed, but what really
         convinced me...

51:36.027 --> 51:39.061
--Poor, poor, Elaine.

51:39.063 --> 51:42.665
     All ginger and no joy.

51:42.667 --> 51:46.068
     -I don't-I don't mind.
          -Yes, you do.

51:46.070 --> 51:49.171
         -Oh, that's...
       -I want you so bad.

51:49.173 --> 51:51.507
        Oh, I am so busy.

51:51.509 --> 51:54.243
--I can't. I can't.

51:54.245 --> 51:57.413
     Uh, I'm, I'm a virgin.

51:58.482 --> 51:59.849
          You all are.

52:11.761 --> 52:15.998
  So basically, I saw Max turn
 Elaine into a vampire, ergo...

52:16.000 --> 52:20.169
       -Max is a vampire.
 -The head vampire, presumably.

52:20.171 --> 52:23.105
     Right. This all started
       after he got here.

52:23.107 --> 52:26.108
       -It's only logical.
        -AMANDA: Logical?

52:26.110 --> 52:29.011
Oh, there's a part of this story
 that you guys think is logical?

52:29.013 --> 52:31.714
    Well, maybe not logical,
            but true.

52:31.716 --> 52:34.150
I don't know what kind of a game
you're trying to play here, Evan

52:34.152 --> 52:37.453
but it is not funny or endearing
           or working.

52:37.455 --> 52:39.688
      And you, you let him
     drag you into this too?

52:39.690 --> 52:41.357
   I thought you were smarter
           than that.

52:41.359 --> 52:42.758
            -Really?
            -Really?

52:42.760 --> 52:45.361
     -And today of all days.
        -What day is it?

52:45.363 --> 52:47.429
  I knew that you were selfish
       and immature, Evan,

52:47.431 --> 52:49.732
  but I did not think that you
   would commit career suicide

52:49.734 --> 52:51.500
      to impress me, it's,
        It's pretty lame.

52:51.502 --> 52:55.037
 Damn it, Amanda! I'm not trying
    to commit career suicide.

52:55.039 --> 52:58.240
      I'm trying to prevent
        career homicide!

52:58.242 --> 52:59.475
          Oh, good one.

52:59.477 --> 53:02.878
         Oh, well, yeah,
        it just came out.

53:02.880 --> 53:04.547
   We have to get out of here.

53:04.549 --> 53:07.449
   The only thing I have to do
 is that Phallusite presentation

53:07.451 --> 53:10.419
 because I actually give a shit
       about my job, so...

53:10.421 --> 53:11.954
            -Touche.
    -Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

53:11.956 --> 53:14.790
   -How do you explain Andrew?
       -What about Andrew?

53:14.792 --> 53:17.259
    He stayed here all night
   working. He looks amazing.

53:17.261 --> 53:18.994
         -Yeah, he does.
            -Exactly!

53:18.996 --> 53:21.096
   You don't think that proves
       supernatural forces

53:21.098 --> 53:22.464
        are at work here?

53:22.466 --> 53:23.933
   All right, Evan, I'm done.
         I'm done with--

53:23.935 --> 53:26.502
   What? Amanda! Amanda, wait,
        wait, wait. Wait.

53:26.504 --> 53:30.773
    Please, wait. I know this
    all sounds crazy. I know.

53:30.775 --> 53:33.475
           But please,
     you have to believe me.

53:34.844 --> 53:36.312
           I love you.

53:39.449 --> 53:40.849
               No.

53:43.153 --> 53:46.322
 So that's what it sounded like.

53:46.324 --> 53:48.624
      Fuck it. I don't care
    if she hates me forever,

53:48.626 --> 53:50.459
        I am not letting
        the woman I love

53:50.461 --> 53:52.895
         get turned into
    a blood-sucking vampire.

53:52.897 --> 53:54.730
            Bam-snap!

53:57.968 --> 53:59.335
              What?

54:01.705 --> 54:05.274
 Is it just me or is this office
         getting darker?

54:05.276 --> 54:09.478
     -And colder too. Look.
              -Oh.

54:11.081 --> 54:13.549
    Okay, it's time we alert
        the authorities.

54:13.551 --> 54:14.483
    -You mean call the cops?
              -Yes.

54:14.485 --> 54:16.352
       And tell them what?

54:16.354 --> 54:20.089
 I mean, everybody that we want
  to report is dead, is here...

54:20.091 --> 54:22.424
          -And working.
             -Shit.

54:23.360 --> 54:25.127
       Or turned to food.

54:25.129 --> 54:28.764
        Oh, god! That was
        Mike's real body.

54:28.766 --> 54:29.999
             Grody.

54:31.067 --> 54:32.968
        Oh, poor Andrew.

54:34.138 --> 54:36.772
     Hey, we did get a bell.
            Bitchin'.

54:36.774 --> 54:38.240
       It's a great idea.

54:38.242 --> 54:41.310
   I think Max really listens
     to what I have to say.

54:41.312 --> 54:42.645
              Dave.

54:45.148 --> 54:50.653
   Andrew has 14 sales today?
              Fuck!

54:50.655 --> 54:53.255
    He's totally going to win
 that Chilli's gift certificate.

54:53.257 --> 54:54.590
   Look, we need to get Amanda

54:54.592 --> 54:56.225
       and we need to get
      the fuck out of here.

54:56.227 --> 54:57.926
     Everyone in this office
        has been turned--

54:57.928 --> 55:00.796
       Well, not everyone.

55:01.865 --> 55:01.997
            Come on.

55:05.935 --> 55:10.372
      Anybody need anything
     from the... break room.

55:17.347 --> 55:19.415
        -Colonel Sanders.
       -At ease, Soldier.

55:19.417 --> 55:22.117
    No, no, no, not at ease.
         It's war time.

55:22.119 --> 55:24.586
   Right, right, right. Yeah.
            I, uh...

55:24.588 --> 55:26.689
           -Attention.
           -Attention.

55:26.691 --> 55:29.692
 Frank, we need your help, okay?

55:29.694 --> 55:32.127
 This is going to sound insane,

55:32.129 --> 55:34.697
      but the entire office
     has been turned into--

55:34.699 --> 55:36.799
   Vampires. Affirmative, sir.

55:38.468 --> 55:40.903
      What? What, you know?

56:04.127 --> 56:06.528
      Oh! Did I not mention
      that Frank was there?

56:06.530 --> 56:09.331
      No, Tim. God damn it.
         No, you didn't.

56:09.333 --> 56:10.999
         Sorry, my bad.

56:11.001 --> 56:12.134
   We hang out a lot actually.

56:12.136 --> 56:13.369
By the way, how amazing was that

56:13.371 --> 56:14.803
         Kelly Clarkson
       concert last night?

56:14.805 --> 56:17.272
          <i>American Idol?</i>
  <i>More like American Treasure.</i>

56:17.274 --> 56:18.507
   Her voice literally sings.

56:18.509 --> 56:19.842
         -It does sing.
       -Her singing sings.

56:19.844 --> 56:21.643
    Oh, how did you get home?
         I blacked out.

56:21.645 --> 56:23.946
   This is not what we're here
         to talk about.

56:23.948 --> 56:26.148
 We need to get upstairs, Frank,
       we need your help.

56:26.150 --> 56:28.684
    We need to get Amanda and
we need to get the hell out of--

56:28.686 --> 56:29.985
      No, no, no, we can't
        just go up there.

56:29.987 --> 56:32.421
       The place is a den
    of the undead right now.

56:32.423 --> 56:35.257
    We need to arm ourselves.
    We need weapons and shit.

56:35.259 --> 56:38.127
      I was waiting for you
          to say that.

56:38.129 --> 56:39.595
    I've got just the thing.

56:43.633 --> 56:46.301
            -Weapons!
          -Okay, okay.

56:50.273 --> 56:54.877
 When she came after that second
  encore, I was like, "whaaat!"

56:54.879 --> 56:56.145
         Almost fainted.

56:56.147 --> 56:57.579
What kills vampires?

56:57.581 --> 56:59.214
            -Stakes.
             -Yeah.

56:59.216 --> 57:00.816
         Anything wooden
  you can jam into their heart.

57:00.818 --> 57:03.952
        Or a sharp blade.
     Decapitations work too.

57:05.688 --> 57:07.456
          Did you think
   this was my first vampire?

57:07.458 --> 57:09.324
 I'm a licensed security guard.

57:09.326 --> 57:12.428
You don't get this patch without
 dusting a few puncture monkeys.

57:17.734 --> 57:20.102
     I looked some stuff up
          on Wikipedia.

57:20.104 --> 57:21.637
- Oh.

57:21.639 --> 57:23.972
      All right, what else?
       Holy water, garlic?

57:23.974 --> 57:26.775
    Ooh, I make a really good
        40-clove chicken.

57:28.111 --> 57:30.779
 But we probably don't have time
    for that right now, guys.

57:30.781 --> 57:32.381
  Sunlight. That burns them up.

57:32.383 --> 57:34.049
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Does it?

57:34.051 --> 57:35.818
        Because, I mean,
     it's daytime right now

57:35.820 --> 57:37.486
    and they don't seem to be
       too bothered by it.

57:37.488 --> 57:40.689
Correct, but that's because this
  facility has a limited number

57:40.691 --> 57:42.724
     of windows to minimize
       visual distractions

57:42.726 --> 57:44.626
  and maximize climate control
          and security.

57:44.628 --> 57:47.062
   You're telling me sunlight
       does kill vampires,

57:47.064 --> 57:50.199
   but we get so little of it
  in this fluorescent shithole,

57:50.201 --> 57:52.134
     that they're just fine?

57:53.636 --> 57:57.206
  -Good god, that's depressing.
        -Yes, sir, it is.

58:01.177 --> 58:04.913
       Sir, I swear to god
      there was an arsenal

58:04.915 --> 58:09.751
     of immense proportions
    in this van this morning.

58:09.753 --> 58:11.920
      Someone has violated

58:11.922 --> 58:14.790
         the sovereignty
   of my vehicular transport.

58:14.792 --> 58:17.292
   They got your stereo, too.

58:17.294 --> 58:18.627
      -Oh, son of a bitch.
              -Hey!

58:20.231 --> 58:24.600
   Oh, my god! Man, hey, hey.
  You can't just... Okay, okay.

58:24.602 --> 58:25.968
   Listen, we need your help.

58:25.970 --> 58:28.136
       All right, this is
     going to sound insane,

58:28.138 --> 58:30.639
      but the entire office
     has been turned into--

58:30.641 --> 58:32.140
         Vampires, yeah.

58:32.142 --> 58:35.344
   -Did everybody know but me?
    -Yeah, it seems that way.

58:35.346 --> 58:36.778
--Oh, fuck!

58:36.780 --> 58:39.414
  Oh, my god, you're a vampire!
           Holy shit!

58:39.416 --> 58:41.116
 Max turned the fucking janitor.

58:41.118 --> 58:43.485
  Well, that one actually makes
  sense if you think about it.

58:43.487 --> 58:44.653
         You're creating
     a lot of dead bodies--

58:44.655 --> 58:45.954
      Yeah, you got blood.

58:45.956 --> 58:47.523
      It's smeared all over
         the walls, man.

58:47.525 --> 58:49.424
     People are struggling,
    they're breaking things.

58:49.426 --> 58:51.159
     You got vans coming in
        full of weapons.

58:51.161 --> 58:53.862
   -You got to clear that out.
     -Okay, okay, I get it.

58:53.864 --> 58:56.064
   I get it. All right, yeah.
           Great idea.

58:56.066 --> 58:59.167
 -He's still a fucking asshole.
-Did you guys really not notice?

58:59.169 --> 59:01.837
 He turned me day one. I've been
     a vampire this whole...

59:01.839 --> 59:04.373
         I-I chased you
      through the cubicles.

59:04.375 --> 59:07.676
    Last night? That was you?
              Um...

59:07.678 --> 59:09.978
       It was really dark.
      I mean, I was scared.

59:09.980 --> 59:12.180
Look, it's not personal. We just
    don't know you that well.

59:12.182 --> 59:13.949
    Yeah. No, no, no. Right.
        Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:13.951 --> 59:17.286
    You know? I mean, we work
 upstairs, we're busy and you...

59:17.288 --> 59:19.288
      Well, how about his?

59:20.925 --> 59:24.092
That's,
       that's scary, yeah.

59:24.094 --> 59:27.496
          -The teeth--
    -Don't patronize me! God!

59:27.498 --> 59:29.264
    Do you even know my name?

59:30.366 --> 59:31.733
            -Janitor?
            -Janitor.

59:33.137 --> 59:36.204
Always keep a provisional weapon
         on your person.

59:40.643 --> 59:42.177
          Wait, where?

59:44.113 --> 59:45.747
             In my--

59:51.921 --> 59:53.722
 Wikipedia did not mention that.

01:00:01.497 --> 01:00:03.932
           No, no, no.
     Okay, okay, wait, wait.

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:06.335
  This means that they can die,
           all right?

01:00:06.337 --> 01:00:08.403
 You just need to find weapons.

01:00:08.405 --> 01:00:11.106
   Oh, hey, maybe the janitor
    put Frank's weapons in...

01:00:13.043 --> 01:00:15.978
   Oh, god, how have they not
     dumped the bodies yet?

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.879
  Trash pick up is on Saturdays

01:00:17.881 --> 01:00:19.681
    unless you make a special
            request,

01:00:19.683 --> 01:00:22.184
    but that's like 60 bucks.

01:00:22.186 --> 01:00:23.652
           Seriously?

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:27.255
God, this fucking company sucks.

01:00:28.358 --> 01:00:30.058
   I've got towels in my car.

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:40.402
    Hi, we're the Phallusite
          Corporation.

01:00:40.404 --> 01:00:42.037
  We have a 4 o'clock meeting?

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:44.940
       Meeting's canceled.

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:52.080
     Go. Go. Go, go, go, go.

01:00:54.884 --> 01:00:56.418
 Say what you want about Elaine,

01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:00.088
  she always did stock the shit
    out of the supply closet.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:01.790
            Bam-snap!

01:01:02.625 --> 01:01:04.359
      That's growing on me.

01:01:20.643 --> 01:01:22.044
              What?

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:37.793
           -Bam-snap!
             -Yeah!

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:43.031
      Today, we become men.

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:46.201
          -Or vampires.
            -Or dead.

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:55.444
           God, Frank,
     what's wrong with you?

01:01:55.446 --> 01:01:57.179
         It's bull piss.

01:02:00.249 --> 01:02:02.250
    It's gonna beat your ass.

01:02:02.252 --> 01:02:05.287
        How many of those
       do you drink a day?

01:02:05.289 --> 01:02:07.055
      As many as it takes.

01:02:10.526 --> 01:02:12.994
   Jeez, anyone that probably
     takes a bite out of you

01:02:12.996 --> 01:02:14.963
  is going to be up for a week.

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:42.390
  Okay, there's a lot of them.

01:02:42.392 --> 01:02:43.992
          Let's focus.

01:02:43.994 --> 01:02:46.294
    We get into Ted's office,
         we grab Mandy,

01:02:46.296 --> 01:02:50.098
      -we get out of here.
   -We got your back, Colonel.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.869
Colonel Sanders.

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:57.773
      Like the chicken guy.

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:01.076
        I just got that.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:07.916
All right,
        vam time. Focus.

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:15.557
        Okay, okay, okay.
 No sudden movements, all right?

01:03:15.559 --> 01:03:18.627
   Just calm careful motions.
   Like you're playing Jenga.

01:03:22.099 --> 01:03:24.599
So, you know, generally it's got
    to be some kind of pass.

01:03:24.601 --> 01:03:26.735
        -People call yet?
          -No, not yet.

01:03:26.737 --> 01:03:28.837
 Maybe they're stuck in traffic.

01:03:30.339 --> 01:03:32.808
        I don't recognize
     a lot of these people.

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:35.443
    That, that's the IT guy.
       There's Marketing.

01:03:35.445 --> 01:03:37.846
  There's the Customer Service
          Call center.

01:03:37.848 --> 01:03:41.650
   -I hired everyone in there.
        -That is ironic.

01:03:41.652 --> 01:03:43.118
      Only if they eat us.

01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:44.553
              Tim.

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:50.358
    What? Oh, did I jinx us?
             My bad.

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:55.730
     Sanders, what the hell
         are you doing?

01:03:55.732 --> 01:03:57.465
 Have, have you lost your mind?

01:03:57.467 --> 01:04:01.369
Amanda, I love you, but you have
  no idea whats going on here.

01:04:01.371 --> 01:04:06.608
-Now you're saying way too much.
 -Tim... Ted, we have a problem.

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:11.980
   Max, in addition to being a
  douchebag, is also a vampire

01:04:11.982 --> 01:04:13.915
   and he's turning every one
        of your employees

01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:15.617
     from the janitor on up.

01:04:15.619 --> 01:04:18.887
  By the way, your neck-biting
         custodial buddy

01:04:18.889 --> 01:04:22.424
  is doing his best impression
  of a Jackson Pollock painting

01:04:22.426 --> 01:04:23.758
     in the parking garage.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.327
           -Bam-snap!
     -AMANDA: Jesus Christ.

01:04:25.329 --> 01:04:27.195
       Evan, what the fuck
         have you done?

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:31.366
Do you have any idea how hard it
 is to find good custodial help?

01:04:31.368 --> 01:04:32.701
        You popped Jerry?

01:04:32.703 --> 01:04:34.069
             -Jerry.
             -Jerry.

01:04:34.071 --> 01:04:36.037
     -That sounds familiar.
    -That was... Yeah. Yeah.

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:37.939
   -That was so embarrassing.
         -I was like...

01:04:37.941 --> 01:04:39.774
        Did you just miss
  the whole un-dead thing, sir?

01:04:39.776 --> 01:04:40.976
              Yeah.

01:04:40.978 --> 01:04:43.812
          God damn it,
    I know they're vampires.

01:04:43.814 --> 01:04:46.248
         Uh, wait. What?

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:48.483
   I track how many paperclips
       we use per quarter,

01:04:48.485 --> 01:04:51.419
   you think I wouldn't notice
  a vampire company take-over?

01:04:51.421 --> 01:04:53.154
     How many paperclips do
       we use per quarter?

01:04:53.156 --> 01:04:56.458
              -Tim!
    -Uh, last quarter, 22415.

01:04:56.460 --> 01:05:00.095
        See? Look at him.
   He's a model employee now.

01:05:00.097 --> 01:05:03.164
       Wait, you did this
         intentionally?

01:05:03.166 --> 01:05:05.634
    Corporate was threatening
 to shut down the entire branch,

01:05:05.636 --> 01:05:08.336
     I simply presented Ted
      with an alternative.

01:05:08.338 --> 01:05:10.939
      His methods may seem
      a little unorthodox,

01:05:10.941 --> 01:05:13.174
       but you can't argue
        with the results.

01:05:13.176 --> 01:05:17.345
     After your little stunt
           in college!

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:20.949
         The only school
       that would take me

01:05:20.951 --> 01:05:25.387
 was this university in Romania.

01:05:25.389 --> 01:05:29.925
    But it turns out, it had
   a very unique MBA program,

01:05:29.927 --> 01:05:33.561
      a whole new paradigm
     in business management

01:05:33.563 --> 01:05:38.733
  What? Turning your employees
   into vampires? That's sick!

01:05:38.735 --> 01:05:40.635
  Evan, this company was sick.

01:05:40.637 --> 01:05:43.271
 Employees calling in with fake,
        dead grandmothers

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:45.040
    so that they could go out
        to the ballpark.

01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:47.475
     Video game tournaments
      during office hours,

01:05:47.477 --> 01:05:50.245
    and look at your browser
           histories.

01:05:50.247 --> 01:05:53.848
 -I know you watch porn all day.
     -That was mainly mine.

01:05:53.850 --> 01:05:55.583
 At least now we have a future.

01:05:55.585 --> 01:06:00.789
     Yeah, funny your usage
     of the word "we" there.

01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:02.023
  What's that supposed to mean?

01:06:02.025 --> 01:06:04.125
          Max was gonna
        fucking eat you.

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:05.694
     I saw it in his files.

01:06:05.696 --> 01:06:07.595
   Why do you think he hasn't
      turned you yet, Ted?

01:06:07.597 --> 01:06:12.000
  He was going to turn me last.
  Make it special with candles.

01:06:12.002 --> 01:06:14.369
              -Oh.
       -That makes sense.

01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:21.309
 You were going to force me out?

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:24.312
Hey, quick, while you still have
     time, Ted. Fire this--

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:26.247
--Oh god!

01:06:26.249 --> 01:06:28.516
       It actually works.
       He really did that.

01:06:28.518 --> 01:06:34.022
     That is the worst part
   of this job. Firing people.

01:06:34.024 --> 01:06:36.758
   Oh, shit. Jeez. He just...

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.460
          -Hey, Mandy.
           -His neck--

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:41.429
   Have you not been listening
        this entire time?

01:06:41.431 --> 01:06:44.065
        We are vampires.
       That's what we do.

01:06:44.067 --> 01:06:46.935
 We get... Still sounds so weird
        saying vampires.

01:06:46.937 --> 01:06:48.703
       So you just do it?

01:06:48.705 --> 01:06:50.872
  It's true. Amanda you got to
          start working

01:06:50.874 --> 01:06:53.742
on your stubbornness if you want
    to be a part of the team.

01:06:53.744 --> 01:06:55.977
    Oh! Fuck your team, Max!

01:06:55.979 --> 01:07:00.682
   I'm taking Amanda and we're
 walking out of here un-undead.

01:07:00.684 --> 01:07:02.350
           Is that so?

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:04.953
        Yeah, I'm gonna,
       I'm gonna do that.

01:07:04.955 --> 01:07:06.221
               Oh.

01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:09.991
             -Okay.
             -Okay?

01:07:09.993 --> 01:07:12.427
   Well, show yourselves out.

01:07:12.429 --> 01:07:16.498
 Can I have a thing, maybe a...
          This will do.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.167
           -Bye, gang.
          -Okay, yeah.

01:07:19.169 --> 01:07:20.935
         -See you guys.
         -See you, man.

01:07:20.937 --> 01:07:23.505
 You got that? You got the door?

01:07:23.507 --> 01:07:24.906
        Back up. Back up!

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:27.442
           Holy shit!

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:31.279
 -Are all these people vampires?
          -Yes, ma'am.

01:07:31.281 --> 01:07:32.580
   Mandy, I don't want to die

01:07:32.582 --> 01:07:33.948
       without telling you
       how I really feel.

01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:35.316
  Well, then shut the fuck up,

01:07:35.318 --> 01:07:36.785
      so you have a reason
      to survive this shit.

01:07:36.787 --> 01:07:39.721
     -So what now, Colonel?
   -Honestly, I have no idea.

01:07:39.723 --> 01:07:41.589
         I never thought
      we'd live this long.

01:07:41.591 --> 01:07:44.626
 To think you came to rescue me
 and you didn't plan an escape?

01:07:44.628 --> 01:07:47.462
   Oh, don't Princess Leah me.
          I'm thinking.

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:50.265
       -Okay, I've got it.
         -Oh, hey, Dave.

01:07:51.535 --> 01:07:53.435
        Good luck getting
    your 20 bucks now, bitch.

01:07:53.437 --> 01:07:55.670
       -God damn it, Tim.
             -Oops.

01:08:02.978 --> 01:08:05.447
 God damn it. Now I'm definitely
 gonna have to wash this shirt.

01:08:05.449 --> 01:08:07.782
     Do you want me to, uh,
            dive in?

01:08:07.784 --> 01:08:11.386
 Oh, no, no, no, no. I need you
    to learn how to delegate.

01:08:21.697 --> 01:08:24.666
        Hey, decapitate.
     You gotta take it off.

01:08:26.535 --> 01:08:28.136
         Hair pulling?!

01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:32.207
     Yipee-Taekwondo-rogue-
    a-motherfucker. Oh, shit!

01:08:33.577 --> 01:08:36.810
      Oh, God! Your breath
      smells like cat-food.

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:46.587
      Oh, I don't like this

01:08:57.366 --> 01:08:59.701
    And I defended your hire.

01:09:08.877 --> 01:09:12.881
  -Does this happen every time?
     -Yeah. Yeah, basically.

01:09:15.584 --> 01:09:18.886
      Not if you kill them
         first, people.

01:09:18.889 --> 01:09:20.721
Learn how to take the initiative

01:09:20.724 --> 01:09:22.924
      if you don't want me
        to micro-manage.

01:09:29.398 --> 01:09:31.832
     This is about the story
          as far as I--

01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:35.670
Well,
  now it's time to go to work.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.374
        AMANDA: Oh, shit.

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:45.613
Jesus,
      those walls are thin.

01:09:47.416 --> 01:09:49.783
       So, my question is,

01:09:49.786 --> 01:09:51.419
  "When do you let your people
     make their own mistakes

01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:53.188
    so that they can learn?"

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:56.057
  and "when do you just jump in
     and do the job yourself

01:09:56.059 --> 01:09:57.292
 because you're more efficient?"

01:09:57.294 --> 01:09:59.727
   -It's a balance to be sure.
             -Yeah.

01:09:59.729 --> 01:10:01.429
        I'm going to need
         a minute, Dave.

01:10:01.431 --> 01:10:03.798
I think I've re-injured my back.

01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:13.875
      God damn it, Amanda!
  I finally started boning her.

01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:14.943
             Sorry.

01:10:14.945 --> 01:10:17.245
Whoa-ho-ho!

01:10:17.247 --> 01:10:18.813
         You know what?
     That almost felt like--

01:10:18.815 --> 01:10:22.350
          Oh, come on.
   Whoa! Did it just get dark?

01:10:22.352 --> 01:10:23.952
 Should we be intervening here?

01:10:23.954 --> 01:10:26.654
      I mean, we are losing
       a lot of employees.

01:10:26.656 --> 01:10:28.623
    Oh, don't worry about it.
     It's mostly marketing.

01:10:28.625 --> 01:10:30.358
            Oh, okay,
      I'll just run an ad.

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:33.695
You fucker.  Take that.

01:10:33.697 --> 01:10:36.831
   Are you trying to repel me
  with a cross made of pencils?

01:10:38.168 --> 01:10:39.400
   Still, a good manager knows

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:40.868
         when his staff
    is getting overextended.

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:44.239
  Be a dear and call downstairs
       for me, would you?

01:10:44.241 --> 01:10:45.540
     Can I use your office?
          This is just,

01:10:45.542 --> 01:10:46.774
     kind of flat out here.

01:10:46.776 --> 01:10:48.376
        Yeah, feel free.
     Make yourself at home.

01:10:48.378 --> 01:10:49.777
  I know you rigged the raffle

01:10:49.779 --> 01:10:52.113
 to win the office trip to Cabo
           this year.

01:10:52.115 --> 01:10:53.748
       That trip was mine!

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:59.087
     You do not want to know
      where that came from.

01:11:03.693 --> 01:11:06.995
   who am I gonna get to stock
     the supply closet now?

01:11:06.997 --> 01:11:09.931
    I'm not a vampire expert,
            asshole.

01:11:09.933 --> 01:11:15.236
     Enough. I want my $20,
        and then you die.

01:11:15.238 --> 01:11:18.139
          I'm saving it
       for something else.

01:11:28.183 --> 01:11:30.551
  Why don't we ever go dancing?

01:11:30.553 --> 01:11:33.087
   Monday night is salsa night
          at Vida Loca.

01:11:37.826 --> 01:11:39.827
           I hope you
     and your dickhead pals

01:11:39.829 --> 01:11:44.632
  enjoyed picking on poor Dave,
   because now my veins surge

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:47.135
   with a thousand generations
            of death.

01:11:47.137 --> 01:11:52.573
   My claws are like hammers,
    my teeth are like swords!

01:11:52.575 --> 01:11:56.077
         I am vengeance!
       And I am immortal!

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:04.585
              Eww.

01:12:04.587 --> 01:12:06.621
 I knew you were a good vampire.

01:12:06.623 --> 01:12:09.991
     I'm not a good vampire.
    I just always hated Dave.

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:15.730
    Well, what now, asshole?

01:12:15.732 --> 01:12:18.833
       Yeah, it looks like
  you're fresh out of friends.

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:21.069
      Nah, I'll make more.

01:12:21.071 --> 01:12:23.304
   Oh, that's a lot of blood!

01:12:23.306 --> 01:12:24.539
             -Yeah.
             -Yeah.

01:12:24.541 --> 01:12:28.176
        -Are you secure?
     -Not in the slightest.

01:12:28.178 --> 01:12:29.177
              Huh?

01:12:29.179 --> 01:12:30.645
  ANDREW: Fuck that NCAA pool.

01:12:30.647 --> 01:12:33.348
    That was a bullshit foul
   at the end of the UNC game.

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:34.515
          Fucking Duke.

01:12:34.517 --> 01:12:36.017
          -You hungry?
             -Yeah.

01:12:36.019 --> 01:12:38.486
     I can punch right into
   this thing. It's hilarious.

01:12:38.488 --> 01:12:40.355
--Yeah!

01:12:40.357 --> 01:12:42.423
       Oh, honestly, guys,

01:12:43.692 --> 01:12:46.361
   did you really think it was
     going to be that easy?

01:12:46.363 --> 01:12:48.763
No, not at first, but then it...

01:12:48.765 --> 01:12:51.199
  -Once we got going, it was...
       -MAX: Oh, come on!

01:12:51.201 --> 01:12:53.434
  You think I would attempt to
  take over this entire company

01:12:53.436 --> 01:12:56.104
 without consulting legal first?

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.441
          Oh, lawyers?

01:13:05.247 --> 01:13:11.252
 Amanda, a private word with you
      in my office please.

01:13:14.923 --> 01:13:18.025
           Um, Amanda,
      where are you going?

01:13:18.027 --> 01:13:22.230
           Uh, I don't
      really know actually.

01:13:22.232 --> 01:13:24.532
  Hey, remember when I did this
  to your girlfriend in college

01:13:24.534 --> 01:13:27.135
          without using
      supernatural powers?

01:13:27.137 --> 01:13:28.669
 Hey, I'm just saying why go pro

01:13:28.671 --> 01:13:30.605
  when your school has a chance
      at the Championships?

01:13:30.607 --> 01:13:32.240
     Run the risk of injury?
           No way man.

01:13:32.242 --> 01:13:34.008
    You got to take the money
            and run.

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:37.478
      Evan, you can go home
          for the day.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:39.647
       Frank, you can die.

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:45.586
      It has been an honor
         and a pleasure

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:47.622
  to serve with you, Colonel...

01:13:47.624 --> 01:13:50.024
  But it's time we parted ways.

01:13:50.026 --> 01:13:52.527
      Any-who, I'm going to
          turn you now.

01:13:52.529 --> 01:13:53.761
       I hope that's cool.

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:56.330
       No, I don't want to
          be a vampire.

01:13:56.332 --> 01:13:59.367
  No, no, no, Frank. They will,
    they will eat you alive.

01:13:59.369 --> 01:14:01.636
Literally. Literally, literally.

01:14:01.638 --> 01:14:04.539
      Not the bullshit way
       most people use it.

01:14:04.541 --> 01:14:06.040
         You never know
    if you're the kind of guy

01:14:06.042 --> 01:14:09.277
    who'll jump on a grenade,
   till it lands at your feet.

01:14:09.279 --> 01:14:10.678
      Man, that's intense.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:11.979
   Being a vampire is amazing.

01:14:11.981 --> 01:14:14.182
   We had a crazy vampire orgy
           last night

01:14:14.184 --> 01:14:15.750
      It was mind-blowing.

01:14:15.752 --> 01:14:17.752
    Yeah, but I just got some
        new golf clubs...

01:14:17.754 --> 01:14:20.288
         Thanks, Frank.
   I'm going to recommend you

01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:23.624
 for a meritorious service medal
     when all this is over.

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:26.127
    I'm not going to let you
         stake me so...

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:30.832
        Some pickle, huh?

01:14:30.834 --> 01:14:35.069
    Much obliged, sir. Now go
   in there and kill our boss.

01:14:40.642 --> 01:14:45.413
   Come on! Come on, get him!

01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:49.750
 Oh, hey, pal! I was just about
        to turn your girl

01:14:49.752 --> 01:14:52.520
   and fuck her on Ted's desk.

01:14:52.522 --> 01:14:55.523
Sorry.  My desk.

01:14:55.525 --> 01:14:57.825
        You fucking dick.

01:14:57.827 --> 01:15:01.062
    Amanda, you need to focus
          on your job.

01:15:01.064 --> 01:15:03.631
    HR is going to be swamped
     with all the new hires

01:15:03.633 --> 01:15:05.466
      we're going to need.

01:15:05.468 --> 01:15:07.435
     Oh, let's just get this
           over with.

01:15:07.437 --> 01:15:08.903
   I'd rather die than listen

01:15:08.905 --> 01:15:11.239
  to your lame management style
           any longer.

01:15:11.241 --> 01:15:16.043
       My management style
  is effective. And refreshing.

01:15:16.045 --> 01:15:20.281
  Okay, option seven, you just
  eat like raccoons and stuff.

01:15:20.283 --> 01:15:22.149
     That is disgusting. No.

01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:28.756
      Evan, do you remember
    what I said we sell here?

01:15:28.758 --> 01:15:32.093
            -Dreams?
    -Yeah, that was bullshit.

01:15:32.095 --> 01:15:33.494
          We sell fear.

01:15:33.496 --> 01:15:38.065
 Option eight, I don't turn you,
        I just kill you.

01:15:38.067 --> 01:15:40.401
  No, that doesn't work for me,
   'cause then I'm just dead.

01:15:40.403 --> 01:15:42.970
    Our customers are afraid.

01:15:42.972 --> 01:15:45.773
        Afraid that life
       is passing them by,

01:15:45.775 --> 01:15:47.542
    which to be fair, it is.

01:15:48.777 --> 01:15:53.648
       And that is why you
   are perfect for this place.

01:15:53.650 --> 01:15:57.585
    Because you are a coward.

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:01.756
           I'm sorry?

01:16:01.758 --> 01:16:04.025
 Okay, option nine, I let you go

01:16:04.027 --> 01:16:05.793
     but you have to promise
       not to kill anyone.

01:16:05.795 --> 01:16:07.428
          No way, man.
      A vamp's got to eat.

01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:11.399
 You were afraid to tell Amanda
  you love her because of why?

01:16:11.401 --> 01:16:13.701
   Because you work together?

01:16:13.703 --> 01:16:15.870
Because she earns more than you?

01:16:15.872 --> 01:16:18.906
            Roshambo?
    Winner chooses our fate?

01:16:21.376 --> 01:16:25.212
  One, two, three, yes! Sorry.

01:16:25.214 --> 01:16:27.214
 You didn't even have the balls
             to quit

01:16:27.216 --> 01:16:30.885
   when this incompetent turd
         passed you over

01:16:30.887 --> 01:16:35.489
    for the guy you hate most
    on the face of the Earth.

01:16:35.491 --> 01:16:37.792
   You are so afraid of life.

01:16:39.027 --> 01:16:43.097
And you actually
    want to be sales manager

01:16:43.099 --> 01:16:44.332
        in this shithole.

01:16:44.334 --> 01:16:45.666
             Mandy!

01:16:45.668 --> 01:16:47.902
          We are trying
     to have a conversation.

01:16:47.904 --> 01:16:50.605
--No!

01:16:53.008 --> 01:16:56.444
    -Well, two out of three?
             -Yeah.

01:16:56.446 --> 01:16:58.212
        One, two, three.

01:16:59.881 --> 01:17:02.984
  I am not going to change you.
          That's right.

01:17:02.986 --> 01:17:08.723
 I'll leave you alive and stuck
 in this pathetic pointless job

01:17:08.725 --> 01:17:12.026
   now, until the day you die.

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:14.662
      This suit is bespoke.

01:17:16.264 --> 01:17:17.465
        One, two, three.

01:17:18.735 --> 01:17:21.002
        sharing the desk
     with the photo printer,

01:17:21.004 --> 01:17:26.474
       while I stay young
    with the woman you love,

01:17:26.476 --> 01:17:28.609
      immortal at my side.

01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:34.682
  I'd rather fucking die first.

01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:39.654
           Yeah, yeah,
    that's the way it works.

01:17:51.401 --> 01:17:53.668
           Holy shit!

01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:55.936
        I think I'm ready
   to turn in my resignation.

01:17:55.938 --> 01:17:57.004
              Yeah.

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:21.262
You want this job? Then take it.

01:18:22.799 --> 01:18:26.934
 Die, you bloodsucking bastard!

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:37.211
            Oh, shit.

01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:51.926
  Well, this is pretty much the
 grossest thing I've ever seen.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:03.003
     I stand corrected. Yuk.

01:19:07.275 --> 01:19:08.476
              Hey.

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:12.780
    Is all this Max's blood?

01:19:14.049 --> 01:19:18.753
     Uh, some of it's mine,
       some of it's Evans.

01:19:18.755 --> 01:19:20.020
              Yeah.

01:19:21.223 --> 01:19:22.323
             Gross.

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:24.391
              Yeah.

01:19:25.727 --> 01:19:27.828
           Hey, Frank?

01:19:28.563 --> 01:19:30.397
    Lost in the line of duty.

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:33.434
    I really liked that guy.

01:19:33.436 --> 01:19:36.370
     Well, on the plus side,
         no more vamps.

01:19:36.372 --> 01:19:37.438
              Yeah.

01:19:40.009 --> 01:19:43.110
   Oh, hey, another work day.

01:19:43.112 --> 01:19:44.378
            Bitchin'

01:20:46.942 --> 01:20:48.943
        EVAN: Is it weird
        that I'm hungry?

01:20:48.945 --> 01:20:50.845
      TIM: Oh, I could eat.

01:20:50.847 --> 01:20:52.246
    AMANDA: Where do you guys
            wanna go?

01:20:52.248 --> 01:20:55.049
  EVAN: Well, somewhere without
          blood on it.

01:20:55.051 --> 01:20:56.483
  TIM: That rules out Denny's.

01:20:58.453 --> 01:21:00.054
      AMANDA: Have a pizza.

01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:05.826
Sorry, Mom. Are you still there?

01:21:05.828 --> 01:21:08.062
           Hey! Yeah.

01:21:08.064 --> 01:21:11.599
     No, you'll never guess
     what happened at work.

01:21:11.601 --> 01:21:13.334
     Oh, you could hear it?

01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:33.520
