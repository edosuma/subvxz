11:28.273 --> 11:29.441
(laughs): Yeah. "The job done."

11:29.573 --> 11:31.784
What fuckin' job are you gonna get done?

11:31.867 --> 11:33.994
- Girls.
- Yeah, girls. Yeah, yeah.

11:34.078 --> 11:35.579
You couldn't fuck yourself with that thing.

11:35.635 --> 11:37.345
You probably done pissed on your own balls

11:37.428 --> 11:39.430
just now, didn't you? You
got wet balls right now?

11:39.510 --> 11:41.637
- I'm 12.
- Yeah, well, 12-year-old dick.

11:41.720 --> 11:43.263
Like, me, when I was 12 years old,

11:43.347 --> 11:45.349
dick sounded just like this.

11:45.482 --> 11:46.900
(brief splash)

11:46.984 --> 11:49.278
Wait for it.

11:49.361 --> 11:51.280
- (urine splashing)
- You hear that?

11:51.328 --> 11:53.122
You hear it get to that bowl?

11:53.205 --> 11:54.415
That's roots, buddy.

11:54.497 --> 11:57.375
That's blood.

11:57.458 --> 12:00.294
Where you come from.

12:00.378 --> 12:01.462
- That shit's important.
- (toilet flushing)

12:01.546 --> 12:03.172
I know you don't give a fuck.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.341
Poop butt. What'd I just say?

12:05.442 --> 12:07.569
You don't listen, that's your problem.

12:07.652 --> 12:08.778
And you're selfish.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.655
I just told you about your family,

12:10.739 --> 12:12.158
and you're over there just
staring at the thing, right?

12:12.241 --> 12:14.452
I see you. You're concentrating.

12:14.536 --> 12:16.913
Concentrate real hard. Be
a 12-year-old. Pie fight.

12:16.997 --> 12:18.540
- It's not a pie fight.
- Ooh. It's not a pie fight?

12:18.623 --> 12:21.168
What is it? I know what you're
doing. It's clowning, buddy.

12:21.265 --> 12:23.225
- No, it's not.
- It's rodeo. It's the same thing

12:23.309 --> 12:25.060
- as clowning with lines.
- No, it's not.

12:25.146 --> 12:26.647
It's not? How do you
know? You ain't never been

12:26.731 --> 12:27.773
- in a fuckin' rodeo.
- Yeah, I have.

12:27.857 --> 12:29.066
Don't lie to me.

12:29.150 --> 12:31.152
- Who took you to rodeo?
- Tom.

12:36.128 --> 12:38.047
Tom took you to rodeo?

12:38.130 --> 12:39.757
Yeah.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.387
Of course he did.

12:43.471 --> 12:44.722
Where'd you go?

12:44.805 --> 12:46.349
I don't know. It was a rodeo.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.683
So you don't remember.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.769
They have clowns at your rodeo?

12:49.851 --> 12:51.436
No? You went to Pomona.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.605
That ain't even a fuckin'
ro... That's a fair.

12:53.688 --> 12:56.191
You went to a fair. You
come see me in Muskogee, boy,

12:56.292 --> 12:58.002
whew, I'm talking about the rodeo.

12:58.086 --> 12:59.337
I'm talking about lights.

12:59.420 --> 13:01.422
Shit. Attractions. Animals.

13:01.506 --> 13:03.174
Did my own face paint. Costume.

13:03.258 --> 13:05.343
You know, commedia dell'arte.
I made them bulls run

13:05.425 --> 13:07.553
till I broke every bone in my cultured ass.

13:07.636 --> 13:09.012
It's different, though. I'm not a clown.

13:09.096 --> 13:10.931
It is different. You bet your
little dick it's different.

13:11.029 --> 13:12.489
It's also the same, too, motherfucker.

13:12.573 --> 13:13.615
That moth... He's in there.

13:13.699 --> 13:14.778
Hey! Rocco!

13:14.780 --> 13:16.824
Didn't I just say? Didn't I just say?

13:16.907 --> 13:18.784
Those are my socks! Goddamn it.

13:18.868 --> 13:21.287
Give me... give me the
call sheet and get the bag.

13:21.369 --> 13:23.288
This motherfucker.

13:27.642 --> 13:29.102
Thank you.

13:29.186 --> 13:31.396
(grunts) You'll get it after.

13:32.861 --> 13:34.696
- Hey, um, Dad?
- 6:00 a.m.

13:34.778 --> 13:36.613
You got to go to sleep early tonight.

13:36.696 --> 13:37.906
Yeah, about that.

13:37.989 --> 13:39.449
Uh...

13:39.532 --> 13:42.410
A.J. has got me tickets
to the Dodgers game,

13:42.510 --> 13:44.220
- which is really cool,
- Oh, shit.

13:44.303 --> 13:46.889
- 'cause Nomo's pitching, and so, uh,
- That is really cool.

13:46.972 --> 13:49.308
you know, he's gonna... he's
gonna take me to the game

13:49.392 --> 13:51.477
- Who's pitching?
- after-after set tomorrow.

13:51.556 --> 13:53.475
- Nomo.
- His name is Nomo?

13:53.558 --> 13:55.060
Yeah, Nomo the Tornado.

13:55.196 --> 13:57.657
- No shit.
- I'm gonna need some of that per diem, you know,

13:57.740 --> 14:00.160
- That's a hell of a name, Tornado.
- for the hot dogs...

14:00.210 --> 14:01.878
and stuff.

14:01.962 --> 14:04.005
- Yeah.
- Call him Tornado, must strike 'em out blindfolded,

14:04.089 --> 14:06.258
- that motherfucker, huh?
- Yeah, probably.

14:06.338 --> 14:09.216
You know what they call a
Japanese blindfold, don't you?

14:09.299 --> 14:12.052
Call that shit a shoelace.

14:12.144 --> 14:13.770
(cackling laughter)

14:13.854 --> 14:16.106
Come on! That shit is funny.

14:16.203 --> 14:19.373
- You know it is. Come on, now.
- Dad, just, just...

14:19.457 --> 14:21.792
Okay. All right. I was getting
ready to lean into another one.

14:21.876 --> 14:24.044
You see me coming with
it? I was gonna hit him

14:24.128 --> 14:26.422
with that "Sum Ting Wong"
joke. You know that one?

14:26.500 --> 14:28.335
You know that shit's some funny fuck...

14:28.419 --> 14:31.755
Hey, buddy, hold on, now,
you're gonna break my shit.

14:31.854 --> 14:33.772
- I didn't mean to.
- Load the fuckin' bag up.

14:33.856 --> 14:36.025
- I didn't mean to.
- Goddamn it.

14:36.114 --> 14:39.618
Watch where your hands are going, man.

14:39.750 --> 14:40.960
(huffing sigh)

14:41.043 --> 14:43.546
So, you're going to this game with A.J.?

14:43.629 --> 14:44.922
Yeah.

14:44.968 --> 14:47.221
Who's driving you?

14:47.304 --> 14:49.139
A.J.

14:50.976 --> 14:52.186
No, no, no, no.

14:52.269 --> 14:54.480
No. You're going to the game with A.J.,

14:54.563 --> 14:56.565
but who's driving?

14:57.771 --> 14:59.356
'Cause he's 14 years old,

14:59.439 --> 15:01.775
and his parents are in Castaic,

15:01.881 --> 15:04.008
so who's driving you to the game?

15:07.882 --> 15:09.133
Tom.

15:09.217 --> 15:10.885
Tom's driving you?

15:10.936 --> 15:12.354
Yeah.

15:16.264 --> 15:18.307
That's all you got to say to me?

15:18.391 --> 15:19.809
I'm sorry, Dad.

15:19.913 --> 15:21.748
For what?

15:21.832 --> 15:23.709
For lying to you.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.669
I just thought y...

15:25.717 --> 15:28.011
you'd get weird, you know?

15:48.622 --> 15:50.832
(siren wailing in distance)

16:03.069 --> 16:05.071
Pull out five socks.

16:05.173 --> 16:07.008
- Five?
- (clears throat) Yeah. You get two.

16:07.092 --> 16:09.969
- Okay.
- You drop any, you're doing ten push-ups.

16:18.977 --> 16:20.604
There you go.

16:23.748 --> 16:25.083
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

16:25.167 --> 16:26.961
Um, remember how you said

16:27.044 --> 16:28.963
you were gonna build me a tree house?

16:29.046 --> 16:30.381
Well, we never owned a tree.

16:30.428 --> 16:32.263
Buy me a tree, I'll get to work.

16:32.347 --> 16:33.640
- Sorry.
- What was that?

16:33.723 --> 16:35.934
- I don't know.
- Pick it up.

16:36.051 --> 16:38.679
(Otis sighs)

16:38.762 --> 16:41.140
- You go to your meeting?
- Yeah.

16:41.242 --> 16:42.577
Was it good?

16:42.660 --> 16:44.162
- Yeah.
- That's good.

16:44.245 --> 16:45.997
We're even.

16:46.077 --> 16:48.079
Yeah, it was like 45 years in the room.

16:48.163 --> 16:50.039
- Whoa.
- Big cakes.

16:50.123 --> 16:52.792
Coming up on four myself.
You know that, right?

16:52.876 --> 16:55.336
- That's crazy.
- Yeah.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.275
All right. Go ahead. Ten.

16:57.358 --> 16:58.985
- Ten?
- Yeah.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.614
- (Otis sighs)
- You gonna get me cake?

17:02.697 --> 17:04.281
OTIS: Yeah, if you want one.

17:05.320 --> 17:07.239
You know what else I want?

17:07.323 --> 17:08.949
- What?
- Want to meet your buddy Tom,

17:09.032 --> 17:10.451
make sure he's not a chicken hawk,

17:10.549 --> 17:11.717
- you hear me?
- He's not.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.135
Yeah, but I don't know he's not.

17:13.219 --> 17:14.553
Yeah, but you need to trust me.

17:14.637 --> 17:15.846
Well, you need to trust me.

17:15.933 --> 17:17.059
I don't know why I don't get to meet him.

17:17.142 --> 17:18.393
Well, because Mom thinks
you get weird, and I...

17:18.477 --> 17:19.770
Yeah, well, your mother
thinks a lot of things

17:19.857 --> 17:21.150
that aren't true. Your
mother lives in fucking space.

17:21.233 --> 17:23.152
She's always been there for me, okay?

17:23.236 --> 17:24.153
Yeah, she's been there for you

17:24.237 --> 17:25.279
and she's been at the Renaissance fair.

17:25.376 --> 17:26.585
I been there for you, too.

17:26.669 --> 17:28.127
I'm the one that gets you
up 4:00 in the morning.

17:28.212 --> 17:29.672
- Who's here now?
- She's busy. She has a job.

17:29.755 --> 17:31.211
- She has...
- Why is she busy? Why is she busy?

17:31.213 --> 17:34.758
- She...
- Why does she have a job?

17:34.842 --> 17:36.260
Think it through. Play the tape out.

17:36.343 --> 17:39.305
What's your mother got a job for? Huh?

17:39.388 --> 17:40.931
- Just in case.
- In case what?

17:41.030 --> 17:42.156
In case what?

17:42.239 --> 17:44.783
- I don't know.
- In case you fail.

17:44.867 --> 17:46.952
- In case it don't work out. Yes, man.
- No. No.

17:47.036 --> 17:48.329
She's filling your head full of fear.

17:48.412 --> 17:50.372
I don't ever do that, do I? Huh?

17:50.421 --> 17:52.006
I pump you full of strength.

17:52.089 --> 17:53.882
'Cause we're on a team, and
I know you got what it takes.

17:53.966 --> 17:55.175
You're a fucking star, and I know it.

17:55.260 --> 17:56.261
That's why I'm here.

17:56.344 --> 17:58.430
I'm your cheerleader, honey boy.

17:58.513 --> 18:00.724
- You trust me?
- (whispers): Yeah.

18:00.859 --> 18:02.569
Okay. Here's a horse trade.

18:02.653 --> 18:05.280
I'll give you this pack of cigarettes...

18:05.362 --> 18:06.613
- The whole pack?
- Whole pack.

18:06.696 --> 18:07.822
You bring him in here.

18:07.906 --> 18:09.449
You got to smoke it in the bathroom though

18:09.532 --> 18:11.201
'cause I don't want people
thinking I'm a shit father.

18:11.283 --> 18:12.951
No one thinks you're a shit father.

18:13.035 --> 18:14.578
- No one thinks I'm a shit father?
- No.

18:14.662 --> 18:16.246
- Your mother thinks I'm a shit father.
- That's in your head.

18:16.348 --> 18:17.933

- That's also in your head.

18:18.016 --> 18:19.810
How do you think you get
in the Big Brothers program?

18:19.842 --> 18:22.219
Huh? What's the main reason?

18:22.303 --> 18:23.471
- There's no main...
- There is a main reason.

18:23.554 --> 18:24.847
- Do you know what it is?
- What is it?

18:24.978 --> 18:26.021
You got to have a shit father.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.606
- No.
- Yes, you do.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.650

18:36.549 --> 18:38.008
Four years is real.

You bring him over here, how about this?

18:39.719 --> 18:42.012
I'll fucking... I'll barbecue for him.

18:42.096 --> 18:44.390
It's just a start. It's just
planting seeds, you know?

18:44.473 --> 18:45.683
Come on, man.

18:45.735 --> 18:48.571
You got to let me in a little bit.

Yeah.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.666
Okay. Okay.

- Thank you, man.

18:55.469 --> 18:57.054

34:16.393 --> 34:18.771
And I-I think that's why, uh,

34:18.853 --> 34:20.938
the Big Brother program is
so important... it's having

34:21.022 --> 34:22.190
the one voice that's gonna listen to you.

34:22.273 --> 34:24.192
- Sure, I bet.
- The only person

34:24.275 --> 34:26.444
- that's gonna be there for you.
- I bet.

34:26.525 --> 34:28.570
So, this father figure.

34:28.652 --> 34:32.114
He was a strong voice, and
now I have a chance to...

34:32.215 --> 34:33.507
- to pay it forward,
- Sure.

34:33.591 --> 34:34.926
help out when I can.

34:35.009 --> 34:36.135
- Yeah.
- You know.

34:36.223 --> 34:37.641
Yeah, I appreciate you, Tom.

34:47.373 --> 34:48.958
Yeah.

34:49.041 --> 34:50.501

34:52.583 --> 34:54.168

34:54.252 --> 34:55.545

35:40.727 --> 35:42.771
if I catch you around my son again

35:42.838 --> 35:45.049

We all know what to do
in the hug circle, right?

36:28.319 --> 36:30.780
This is a feeling that you can have

36:30.863 --> 36:32.156
anywhere you are.

36:32.239 --> 36:34.158
You can always come back here.

36:34.241 --> 36:36.035

36:36.117 --> 36:37.786
To this circle.

36:37.869 --> 36:39.454
To this feeling.

36:39.537 --> 36:41.831
Hugging yourself releases
the cuddle hormone.

36:41.933 --> 36:43.851
Can you feel that?

36:43.935 --> 36:46.521
And that's a tool we
can use wherever we are.

36:46.603 --> 36:48.522
You can't do this everywhere.

36:48.605 --> 36:49.815
Right?

36:49.898 --> 36:51.983
You can, actually.

36:52.071 --> 36:53.447
You can't do this

36:53.531 --> 36:57.409
in a car on the freeway or in court.

36:57.510 --> 37:00.888
Well, maybe if you used this tool,

37:00.969 --> 37:03.263
you wouldn't end up in court.

37:03.346 --> 37:05.849
Isn't hugging yourself
like tickling yourself?

can't tickle yourself?

37:29.305 --> 37:30.764
I have a suggestion.

37:30.848 --> 37:32.933
I think maybe you should
go out into the woods

37:33.031 --> 37:34.574
and scream as loud as you can.

37:34.657 --> 37:36.910

37:52.775 --> 37:53.859
Yeah, I got PTSD.

37:53.943 --> 37:55.486

black people got that shit.

here, and these people...

38:15.199 --> 38:17.493

38:17.622 --> 38:19.791

38:19.874 --> 38:22.836

beat my motherfuckin' ass.

38:22.922 --> 38:24.757
Yeah, you should send him a scarf.

44:53.454 --> 44:56.791
that was a good time to tell
me she, uh, preferred women.

44:56.874 --> 44:59.001
Specifically this woman...

44:59.085 --> 45:02.880
who was a mean-ass woman
and an outrageous alcoholic.

45:02.963 --> 45:05.632
She'd beat you over the head
until she broke her hand,

45:05.715 --> 45:07.342
just keep laying in on you.

45:07.444 --> 45:09.196
Just... did not give a shit.

45:09.280 --> 45:11.282
Do it again the next day.

45:12.782 --> 45:15.201
Always remember her hand in a cast.

45:18.704 --> 45:21.415
(sputters) Drama.

45:21.515 --> 45:23.559
Just drama, you know?

45:23.642 --> 45:26.729
Mother fell out of a
window, landed on a freeway.

45:28.144 --> 45:30.354
Major fucking drama. (chuckles)

45:30.438 --> 45:31.981
(clears throat)

45:34.653 --> 45:37.781
Had alcohol and weed, and
I grieved her, and, uh,

45:37.884 --> 45:40.345
then I joined the army.

45:40.428 --> 45:42.263
'Cause what else?

45:43.844 --> 45:46.013
And I came home...

45:46.096 --> 45:48.098
uh, spun out.

45:50.109 --> 45:51.485
I did so much fucking cocaine,

45:51.600 --> 45:53.226
can't breathe out my nose no more.

45:53.310 --> 45:55.604
Started shooting it in into my arm.

45:55.687 --> 45:57.773
Just didn't give a shit no more.

45:57.875 --> 46:01.170
Drinking every day straight. Weeks.

46:01.253 --> 46:03.672
Fell into a blackout.

46:11.181 --> 46:13.517
Woke up a sex offender.

46:13.613 --> 46:15.573
(breath trembles)

46:17.451 --> 46:19.954
Said I didn't rape the
girl, but I did enough

46:20.037 --> 46:23.290
to get her to jump out of a moving car.

46:23.375 --> 46:26.086
Yeah, that's where my disease took me.

46:27.604 --> 46:29.523
And they took me to Tehachapi,

46:29.606 --> 46:33.068
and I stayed there for
three years, nine months.

46:33.148 --> 46:35.650
Lost a lot.

46:35.733 --> 46:37.485
Found a program in jail.

46:37.571 --> 46:39.489
Found God in the program.

46:39.573 --> 46:42.117
Found page 429. It says:

46:42.217 --> 46:44.511
"Those actions that once made you feel

46:44.595 --> 46:46.805
"completely... ashamed...

46:46.889 --> 46:48.891
"(chuckles softly): and totally discouraged

46:48.974 --> 46:51.226
"will allow you to share with other people

46:51.310 --> 46:53.770
how to be a useful human being."

47:01.376 --> 47:03.128
Found gratitude in God.

47:03.212 --> 47:05.756
Realized I had a son I had to raise.

47:05.839 --> 47:07.966

for other people's ideas.

54:21.157 --> 54:23.243

I like it a lot. I think it's very funny.

59:46.194 --> 59:47.821
- Okay, fine. Okay.
- Just try it.

59:47.902 --> 59:49.362
- Let's go.
- Ready?

59:49.445 --> 59:51.114
"Jeff, come on, it's
been over an h..." See?

59:51.197 --> 59:52.615
And you're gonna start on
the floor after I just said

59:52.700 --> 59:54.201
- it's a sight gag.
- I... I told you,

59:54.285 --> 59:56.078
- it's just for heart rate.
- Yeah, but if it's a sight gag

59:56.162 --> 59:57.329
and I can't see you, how
the fuck does that work?

59:57.431 --> 01:00:00.267
I'm just getting into the, into... (sighs)

01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:01.977
I just told...

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:03.729
- You just told me what?
- I just told you, like,

01:00:03.811 --> 01:00:05.313
I don't need to do it in the scene.

01:00:05.396 --> 01:00:06.522
It's not gonna happen in the scene.

01:00:06.606 --> 01:00:07.607
Nobody cares about the fucking heart rate.

01:00:07.689 --> 01:00:08.773
I care about the fucking heart rate, okay?

01:00:08.857 --> 01:00:09.774
They want to see funny faces.

01:00:09.858 --> 01:00:12.027
All right, heart rate man.

01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:13.695
- Great.
- They want to see funny faces, Otis.

01:00:13.792 --> 01:00:14.752
But all right, let's go. Ready?

01:00:14.835 --> 01:00:15.961
"Jeff, come on, it's been over an hour.

01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:17.087
"I got a date with Dewey.

01:00:17.171 --> 01:00:19.673
"I got to get in there.
I got to do my hair.

01:00:19.759 --> 01:00:21.385
What are you doing in there?"

01:00:21.469 --> 01:00:22.929
(grunting): What... if...

01:00:23.012 --> 01:00:25.640
- That's it.
- I... was... doing...

01:00:25.723 --> 01:00:27.683
something... stupid...

01:00:27.785 --> 01:00:29.536
BOTH: in... here...

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:31.622
Jac...

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:35.581

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:37.416
"As opposed to this?"

01:00:37.471 --> 01:00:39.097
I know you want to hang out
with your secret buddies,

01:00:39.181 --> 01:00:40.641
- but I have to...
- "Buddies." Hold on.

01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:42.059
- (women chattering outside)
- (door opens)

01:00:42.142 --> 01:00:43.769
JAMES: Shut the fuck up!

01:00:43.897 --> 01:00:45.524
I can't think in here!

01:00:45.607 --> 01:00:47.442
It's 12:00 midnight. Shut the fuck up.

01:00:47.528 --> 01:00:48.737
Some of us got jobs.

01:00:48.821 --> 01:00:50.406
- You know what I'm saying?
- (chatter continues)

01:00:50.489 --> 01:00:51.824
Shut the fuck up!

01:00:51.907 --> 01:00:53.951
I don't do this shit to you, Deb,

01:00:54.033 --> 01:00:55.076
but you're having a fucking quinceañera!

01:00:55.159 --> 01:00:56.119
It's 12:00 midnight!

01:00:56.202 --> 01:00:57.537
- What the fuck?
- Keep going with this shit!

01:00:57.619 --> 01:00:59.621
I'll call la migra in a fucking heartbeat!

01:00:59.705 --> 01:01:00.872
I don't give a fuck!

01:01:00.956 --> 01:01:02.416
Worry about your son over there!

01:01:02.517 --> 01:01:04.436
Worry about yourself!

01:01:04.519 --> 01:01:07.355
(Deb continues shouting in distance)

01:01:07.406 --> 01:01:08.782
(door opens)

01:01:08.865 --> 01:01:10.742
- (door slams)
- JAMES: I'm gonna fuckin'...

01:01:10.826 --> 01:01:13.453
I'm gonna crack in half, I swear to God.

01:01:15.111 --> 01:01:16.654
This place... (sighs)

01:01:16.738 --> 01:01:18.031
(knocking)

01:01:18.131 --> 01:01:19.466
JAMES: No.

01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:20.842
- (knocking)
- No, Deb. No!

01:01:20.925 --> 01:01:22.010
- No, Deb!
- Come on out here.

01:01:22.093 --> 01:01:23.678
- Back off my door!
- All right, I'll do that.

01:01:23.763 --> 01:01:25.306
- I will... I will do that.
- It's about respect.

01:01:25.389 --> 01:01:26.974
And I understand that. Well,
if you got your respect,

01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:28.392
- Hey, hey, hey, hey...
- you got to respect

01:01:28.476 --> 01:01:30.311
that me and my girls
are over there chillin'

01:01:30.394 --> 01:01:31.812
- Go over by the flagpole!
- at our party

01:01:31.896 --> 01:01:33.856
- enjoying ourself, okay?
- JAMES: I'm not trying

01:01:33.955 --> 01:01:36.375
- to interfere with that!
- You knew it was a spot

01:01:36.458 --> 01:01:37.667
- when you moved in here, okay?
- Okay.

01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:39.210
- And it is what it is.
- Okay, well,

01:01:39.293 --> 01:01:40.669
it is what it is, and it ain't

01:01:40.753 --> 01:01:42.630
- what it fucking ain't, isn't it?
- It is, yes...

01:01:42.711 --> 01:01:45.005
So why don't you get your silly
ass back the fuck over there?

01:01:45.089 --> 01:01:47.007
Oh, so you acting like you
run something now in here?

01:01:47.091 --> 01:01:48.300
- I'll stop...
- Run what?

01:01:48.405 --> 01:01:49.697
You don't run shit here.

01:01:49.781 --> 01:01:51.408
You better miss me with that.

01:01:51.491 --> 01:01:54.119
- You don't run a damn thing over here!
- Okay.

01:01:54.201 --> 01:01:55.661
That's strike one! That's strike one!

01:01:55.744 --> 01:01:58.455
- I'll wait.
- Now it's fucking war!

01:01:58.505 --> 01:01:59.798
Motherfucker!

01:01:59.881 --> 01:02:03.093
- You ready?
- Let's take a break.

01:02:03.172 --> 01:02:04.340
I don't want to take a
break. You got this scene.

01:02:04.423 --> 01:02:06.092
- Let's go again.
- I-I have the scene.

01:02:06.175 --> 01:02:08.135
- You don't have the scene yet.
- I think... I think it's okay.

01:02:08.267 --> 01:02:09.309
Let's just, let's just end it.

01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:10.686
Yeah, but I don't think it's okay, so we're

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:12.229
gonna keep going till you make me laugh,

01:02:12.312 --> 01:02:13.313
or we're gonna do it
all fucking night. Ready?

01:02:13.401 --> 01:02:14.861
Give me a fucking cigarette.

01:02:14.944 --> 01:02:16.529
- You want a cigarette?
- Yeah.

01:02:17.529 --> 01:02:18.864
There.

01:02:18.947 --> 01:02:20.574
There you go. You happy now?

01:02:20.657 --> 01:02:22.701
There you go, Fauntleroy.
You got a fucking cigarette.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.385
Go ahead, smoke it.

01:02:26.554 --> 01:02:28.389
Oh, look at that. You're gonna let it burn

01:02:28.473 --> 01:02:30.641
a hole in the carpet? I don't give a shit.

01:02:30.725 --> 01:02:31.976
You're paying for it.

01:02:32.059 --> 01:02:33.895
Do what you want.

01:02:36.603 --> 01:02:38.897
Do you know I'm doing
you a favor by paying you

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.543
- to be my chaperone?
- You're doing me a favor?

01:02:40.627 --> 01:02:42.545
- Wow.
- Who else is gonna give

01:02:42.631 --> 01:02:44.466
- a felon a job?
- You're doing me a favor?

01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:46.801
- I'm not stupid.
- I don't like when you talk to me like that.

01:02:46.885 --> 01:02:49.262
I don't like you talking
to me like I work for you,

01:02:49.345 --> 01:02:50.721
- like I'm your mother.
- You do work for me. I'm your boss.

01:02:50.804 --> 01:02:51.889
You know what? Don't
say another fuckin' word.

01:02:51.972 --> 01:02:53.307
I'm about to lose my shit, right now.

01:02:53.405 --> 01:02:54.907
You're pushing me over the fuckin' edge.

01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:56.492
You understand what I'm saying?

01:02:56.575 --> 01:02:58.160
I don't have to be here.

01:02:58.243 --> 01:03:00.787
I can be gone in a second.
I can be gone in a second.

01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:02.539
I can be pulling eight, ten grand a week.

01:03:02.622 --> 01:03:04.499
- I want you to be here.
- Shut your fuckin' mouth.

01:03:04.582 --> 01:03:05.917
Didn't I say don't say
another fuckin' word?

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.669
- I want you...
- Shut the fuck up.

01:03:07.722 --> 01:03:09.724
Shut the fuck up! Didn't I
say don't say a fuckin' word?

01:03:09.807 --> 01:03:11.851
- Say one more word. Say one more word.
- I want...

01:03:11.935 --> 01:03:13.269
You want to be a fucking
smart-ass with me?

01:03:13.403 --> 01:03:14.779
Shut the fuck up. Didn't I say that?

01:03:14.862 --> 01:03:16.155
Huh? Didn't I say that to you?

01:03:16.239 --> 01:03:17.657
I want you to be here, Dad.

01:03:17.739 --> 01:03:19.366
- Now you want me to be here?
- Yes.

01:03:19.449 --> 01:03:22.411
I can't figure out who the
fuck you are, actor man.

01:03:22.494 --> 01:03:24.580
What the fuck do you
want me to be here for?

01:03:24.681 --> 01:03:26.808
- Give me one reason.
- You have good instincts.

01:03:26.891 --> 01:03:28.935
I have good instincts? I
got rodeo clown instincts.

01:03:29.017 --> 01:03:30.935
Why I could never make it in Hollywood.

01:03:31.019 --> 01:03:32.270
I like pussy too much.

01:03:32.353 --> 01:03:34.102
You could if you started when I did.

01:03:34.104 --> 01:03:36.231
And then I could have
been a big fucking, uh, uh,

01:03:36.315 --> 01:03:37.775
a champion pie fighter?

01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:39.941
Huh? Doing fucking push-ups.

01:03:45.997 --> 01:03:48.791
Wipe your face, Otis.
Don't cry in front of me.

01:03:50.733 --> 01:03:53.361
I'm not gonna ask you again, Otis.

01:03:58.569 --> 01:04:01.572
You keep pushing me.

01:04:01.655 --> 01:04:02.990
Thank you.

01:04:03.075 --> 01:04:05.994
- And the other one.
- Mmm, mmm, mmm!

01:04:06.078 --> 01:04:09.289
Well, this culinary spread
is beautisimiss, Jeff.

01:04:09.389 --> 01:04:12.975
Well, it's all thanks to Royston.

01:04:13.058 --> 01:04:15.102
Thank you, Royston. This is splendid.

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:16.978
(mocking): This is splendid.

01:04:20.197 --> 01:04:22.658
- What has gotten into you, son?
- You know what?

01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:25.370
Here.

01:04:25.454 --> 01:04:27.873
Here's the keys to the
new house. Take that.

01:04:27.975 --> 01:04:30.686
(sighs) Is that what you
think this is all about?

01:04:30.769 --> 01:04:32.563
That... I'm leaving

01:04:32.641 --> 01:04:35.060
because Mommy and I got a second house?

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.772
Well, yeah.

01:04:38.823 --> 01:04:41.701
Royston, do you mind?

01:04:41.784 --> 01:04:43.828
You heard him, Royston.

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:52.554
So you're staying?

01:04:52.638 --> 01:04:54.431
Of course.

01:04:54.515 --> 01:04:58.352
Do you really think I would
leave you and Royston behind?

01:04:59.854 --> 01:05:02.607
(softly): I just... I just...

01:05:02.705 --> 01:05:07.085
(sighs) Well, I just thought
you didn't love us anymore.

01:05:07.168 --> 01:05:08.545
Oh.

01:05:10.598 --> 01:05:12.725
I love you, Jeff.

01:05:14.391 --> 01:05:17.436
I love you more than words can say.

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:22.606
(TV Dad sighs)

01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:24.200
DIRECTOR: And cut. We have it.

01:05:24.284 --> 01:05:25.827
- (others clapping)
- Yeah, that was great.

01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:28.204
You feeling all right?

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:30.217
- (bell rings)
- DIRECTOR: Beautiful.

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:32.010
(TV Dad clears throat)

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:34.346
DIRECTOR: Yeah, we need a wide shot...

01:05:34.476 --> 01:05:37.521
Well, this culinary spread
is beautisimiss, Jeff.

01:05:37.605 --> 01:05:39.690
OTIS: Well, it's all thanks to Royston.

01:05:39.772 --> 01:05:40.940
(Otis snaps fingers)

01:05:41.024 --> 01:05:42.400
TV DAD: Thank you, Royston.

01:05:42.483 --> 01:05:45.320
- This is splendid.
- (mocking): "This is splendid."

01:05:46.997 --> 01:05:49.624
What has gotten into you, son?

01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:56.798
Dad?

01:06:00.402 --> 01:06:02.613
I need you to hear me.

01:06:07.036 --> 01:06:09.747
I'm gonna say some
things that I got to say,

01:06:09.826 --> 01:06:13.288
and I need you to not
interrupt me or run off.

01:06:14.849 --> 01:06:16.684
Okay?

01:06:16.768 --> 01:06:18.645
I was thinking.

01:06:18.727 --> 01:06:21.855
The other day when we were talking about...

01:06:21.938 --> 01:06:25.025
Tom and the rodeo, and I was thinking

01:06:25.108 --> 01:06:29.404
what other happy memories
I had of you and me, and...

01:06:29.506 --> 01:06:32.842
and I-I swear to God...

01:06:32.925 --> 01:06:36.804
I've always been waiting for
you to act like a real dad.

01:06:38.137 --> 01:06:42.350
You haven't done that one time.

01:06:45.535 --> 01:06:48.538
I've missed you for a long time, Dad.

01:06:50.123 --> 01:06:53.042
TV DAD: I love you, Jeff.

01:06:53.127 --> 01:06:56.130
I love you more than words can say.

01:07:03.530 --> 01:07:04.865
What?

01:07:04.948 --> 01:07:07.075
- What?
- (TV show continues)

01:07:07.159 --> 01:07:08.702
- Ow.
- Otis...

01:07:08.784 --> 01:07:10.578
hey, what's wrong with
you? Go pick that up.

01:07:10.661 --> 01:07:11.996
OTIS (on TV): I'll kick your butt.

01:07:12.079 --> 01:07:13.581
No, I'm the funny one around here.

01:07:13.663 --> 01:07:15.540
You stand up, I'm gonna
kick your butt right now.

01:07:15.623 --> 01:07:17.792
- What are you crying about?
- I'm not crying.

01:07:17.895 --> 01:07:19.646
Otis.

01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:21.106
Tom.

face-fuck his dead family.

01:07:25.527 --> 01:07:27.696
- Yeah, well...

Shut the fuck up!

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:35.467
Don't talk to me like that, Otis.

Listen to me and let me talk!

Lower your voice, Otis.

01:07:39.767 --> 01:07:41.685
I want you to be a better dad to me.

01:07:41.769 --> 01:07:43.604
- All right.
- So I want you to promise me...

01:07:43.684 --> 01:07:47.063
put your pinky out right now...
and I want you to promise me

01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:50.358
that you're gonna be better to me...

01:07:50.458 --> 01:07:52.836
Yeah, I'll be better to you.

I'll tell you what, I get it, man.

01:08:13.665 --> 01:08:15.292
I hear you. You want a better father.

01:08:15.375 --> 01:08:18.920
