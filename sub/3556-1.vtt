00:15.641 --> 00:17.038
The littlest schmoop

00:17.039 --> 00:18.435
in the chicken coop goes...

00:18.477 --> 00:19.853
Moop, moop, moop.

00:18.477 --> 00:21.229
Moop, moop, moop.

00:22.795 --> 00:24.316
Moop, moop, moop.

00:21.271 --> 00:24.316
Moop, moop, moop.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.214
The skinniest schmoop in

00:26.215 --> 00:28.069
the chicken coop goes...

00:29.259 --> 00:30.405
Scoop, scoop, scoop.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.615
Scoop, scoop, scoop.

00:31.616 --> 00:32.783
'Cause he's getting

00:30.447 --> 00:32.783
all that food, right?

00:32.825 --> 00:34.075
Scooping it all up.

01:02.021 --> 01:03.773
Love my job. Not every

01:03.774 --> 01:05.524
day of course.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.609
But, uh, it's a good life.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.387
Ronald Douche

Truman is, uh, a newer

01:22.959 --> 01:25.168
high school, opened in 2007.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.941
Our first senior class just

01:26.942 --> 01:28.672
graduated this last spring.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.591
- We serve, uh,
- over 1,000 students,

01:30.632 --> 01:32.363
Most of them from

01:32.364 --> 01:34.093
right here in good old

01:30.632 --> 01:34.093
southwestern Los Angeles.

01:35.888 --> 01:36.889
Some kids back there.

01:39.058 --> 01:40.099
Hey, guys.

01:43.311 --> 01:44.396
Terrific.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.328
We are fortunate

01:59.329 --> 02:01.288
enough to have some of the

01:57.367 --> 02:01.288
latest technology available.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.164
Beautiful chemistry labs.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.687
They did such a nice

02:04.688 --> 02:06.167
job on the installation.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.732
Two well-stocked computer labs

02:07.733 --> 02:09.253
training on many programs.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.464
Great start, great

02:10.465 --> 02:11.632
foundation, great base.

02:11.673 --> 02:12.674
We'll have a giant hammer

02:12.675 --> 02:13.675
come up here with a claw.

02:13.717 --> 02:15.677
Kadoosh!

02:15.719 --> 02:17.116
And of course,

02:17.117 --> 02:18.513
our nationally ranked

02:15.719 --> 02:18.513
robotics team.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.795
- Gonna shoot something out.
- Oh, this is a great start.

02:30.943 --> 02:33.967
In 1999, I was writing

02:33.968 --> 02:36.991
for Mattel toys for their

02:30.943 --> 02:36.991
Barbie doll website.

02:38.117 --> 02:39.200
"Barbie for president."

02:39.242 --> 02:41.120
I was, uh... I was supposed

02:41.121 --> 02:42.997
to be writing Barbie's

02:39.242 --> 02:42.997
election platform.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.269
Um, you know,

02:44.270 --> 02:45.499
more swimming pools.

02:45.540 --> 02:46.604
No brown shoes

02:46.605 --> 02:47.668
with black pants.

02:49.753 --> 02:51.630
- Six months later,
- I was a teacher.

03:07.104 --> 03:08.251
This is

03:08.252 --> 03:09.397
a tough part of town.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.649
The kids know it's

03:10.650 --> 03:11.859
not gonna be easy.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.568
We're giving them hope.

03:13.569 --> 03:15.236
Throwing them a rope.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.758
- The kids are
- appreciative of that.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.492
- You know, of what
- we do here for them.

03:21.994 --> 03:23.202
For the community.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.706
It's, uh... Wow, I'm getting

03:25.707 --> 03:27.124
a little filled up here.

03:29.877 --> 03:30.919
But, uh,

03:32.295 --> 03:33.422
I take a lot

03:33.423 --> 03:34.548
of pride in that.

03:34.589 --> 03:35.966
Douche!

03:36.008 --> 03:37.948
You know what?

03:37.949 --> 03:39.887
It's pronounced

03:36.008 --> 03:39.887
"Dow-shay," not Douche!

03:39.928 --> 03:41.262
Dow-shay.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.098
It is the same spelling

03:43.099 --> 03:44.892
but the Dutch pronunciation!

03:44.933 --> 03:46.744
- That is it, young man.
- That is it. I see you.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.541
That is detention.

03:48.542 --> 03:50.313
Detention for

03:46.768 --> 03:50.313
the entire year.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.503
Put the cameras away.

03:52.504 --> 03:54.651
Put them away. Put them away.

03:54.693 --> 03:55.945
Turn off those...

03:55.946 --> 03:57.196
Okay, you know what?

03:54.693 --> 03:57.196
As soon as I'm done here,

03:57.237 --> 03:58.384
that is it for you.

03:58.385 --> 03:59.531
Confiscated. Both of you.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.158
- Phones are going
- to be gone.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.040
It's pronounced "Dow-shay."

04:15.005 --> 04:16.315
Okay,
- let's get settled in!

04:16.339 --> 04:18.237
This is not a bad

04:18.238 --> 04:20.135
dream. It is Monday.

04:16.339 --> 04:20.135
You are back in class.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.950
I want you to take out your

04:21.951 --> 04:23.722
journals and take a look

04:20.177 --> 04:23.722
at the topic on the board.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.286
I want you guys

04:25.287 --> 04:26.808
to write about

04:23.764 --> 04:26.808
something that you like.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.309
- But you hide it
- from your friends

04:28.351 --> 04:29.436
Because you are afraid

04:29.437 --> 04:30.520
of what they will think.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.086
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

04:33.087 --> 04:34.399
I'll go first. Um...

04:36.193 --> 04:37.653
When I was in high school,

04:37.654 --> 04:39.113
I really loved the ballet.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.449
My mother used to take

04:42.450 --> 04:44.325
me to see The Nutcracker

04:40.572 --> 04:44.325
every Christmas.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.345
- But I was afraid that - my friends would
- Make fun of me,

04:46.369 --> 04:47.475
So I told them that she was

04:47.476 --> 04:48.580
taking me to a Laker game.

04:49.831 --> 04:50.999
All right, you guys are

04:51.000 --> 04:52.167
up now, you got 15 minutes.

04:54.044 --> 04:55.316
I like to start class

04:55.317 --> 04:56.588
with a writing exercise.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.882
It gets their brains

04:57.883 --> 04:59.133
in the right place.

04:59.174 --> 05:00.300
Especially on a Monday.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.973
- Okay, let's share
- our responses.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.871
Oh, come on, I told

05:08.872 --> 05:10.351
you about the ballet.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.979
- It's all downhill
- from there.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.106
Zola.

05:14.148 --> 05:15.795
Sometimes when I'm

05:15.796 --> 05:17.442
depressed, the only thing

05:14.148 --> 05:17.442
that makes me feel better

05:17.484 --> 05:18.923
is listening to Dora the

05:18.924 --> 05:20.361
Explorer song on my iPod.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.574
Marcus.

05:24.616 --> 05:27.265
Uh, um, one time when I was

05:27.266 --> 05:29.913
visiting my grandparents,

05:29.955 --> 05:31.311
I woke up in the

05:31.312 --> 05:32.666
middle of the night

05:29.955 --> 05:32.666
to take some Advil,

05:32.707 --> 05:34.375
- but it was my
- grandpa's Viagra.

05:36.419 --> 05:37.504
You were supposed

05:37.505 --> 05:38.588
to write about something

05:36.419 --> 05:38.588
that you liked!

05:39.756 --> 05:41.175
Did you like that?

05:42.634 --> 05:44.365
Are you going to be talking

05:44.366 --> 05:46.096
to the other teachers, too?

05:46.138 --> 05:47.306
Um...

05:47.346 --> 05:48.452
I just...

05:48.453 --> 05:49.557
I think it's important.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.330
And this is why.

05:51.331 --> 05:53.061
I mean, yeah, I'm, uh,

05:49.599 --> 05:53.061
"Teacher of the Year."

05:53.103 --> 05:54.956
- That's... And which is
- great, and I love it.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.457
- I love that you guys are
- here doing this movie.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.417
- I think it's important.
- I hope we can show something

05:58.441 --> 05:59.714
About public schools

05:59.715 --> 06:00.986
and what's happening here.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.530
But, uh, the award itself,

06:03.571 --> 06:05.990
is really the byproduct

06:05.991 --> 06:08.409
of all of our work together

06:03.571 --> 06:08.409
here at this school.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.662
Yes, I won it,

06:10.663 --> 06:12.873
but, um, you know...

06:14.833 --> 06:16.043
I don't do this by myself,

06:16.044 --> 06:17.252
I guess is all I'm saying.

06:14.833 --> 06:17.252
Right.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.379
These kids don't get

06:19.380 --> 06:21.464
better just because

06:17.294 --> 06:21.464
I show up and do my thing.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.466
I'm not laughing.

06:23.467 --> 06:25.426
I'm being serious here.

06:21.506 --> 06:25.426
You come on.

06:25.468 --> 06:26.887
We are the Hammers. Uh,

06:26.888 --> 06:28.305
though we're not married.

06:25.468 --> 06:28.305
No, we are not.

06:28.347 --> 06:29.389
My name is Clive Hammer.

06:29.390 --> 06:30.431
I am Lowell Hammer.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.059
- And we are
- guidance counselors.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.894
- Well, we're
- college counselors.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.687
- But we guide
- you to college.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.480
So we're kind of like...

06:37.522 --> 06:39.233
Religious leaders.

06:39.274 --> 06:40.317
Shamans.

06:40.359 --> 06:41.985
- Shaymans.
- It's actually shaman.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.195
I think it's shayman.

06:43.196 --> 06:44.363
Well, shayman suggests

06:42.027 --> 06:44.363
that we shame them.

06:44.403 --> 06:45.464
- Which we're
- not afraid to do.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.573
- Which we will
- use shame.

06:46.614 --> 06:47.657
So...

06:49.492 --> 06:50.785
- We will answer
- questions.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.016
We've got experience.

06:52.017 --> 06:53.205
We speak from the hip.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.290
We throw it from

06:54.291 --> 06:55.332
the kneecap.

06:55.374 --> 06:56.851
- We toss it. - Which is even
- Lower than the hip.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.127
Yeah, well, some guys,

06:58.128 --> 06:59.378
some guys will

06:56.875 --> 06:59.378
talk from the hip.

06:59.418 --> 07:00.545
We take it from the kneecap.

07:00.546 --> 07:01.671
We like to throw it

06:59.418 --> 07:01.671
from below the hip.

07:01.713 --> 07:03.691
- We just toss it out to you. - Which is even a
- Straighter shot.

07:03.715 --> 07:04.883
Yeah, it's a straight shot,

07:04.884 --> 07:06.051
straight into your mouth.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.677
Think
- about it like this.

07:07.719 --> 07:10.180
If college were hell...

07:10.222 --> 07:11.472
And it is, guys.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.515
For a while, it's hell.

07:12.557 --> 07:13.892
Best time of your life,

07:13.934 --> 07:15.536
- best years of your life, - but it's hell.
- But it's hellish.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.103
It's like a burning

07:17.104 --> 07:18.646
inferno of hell and hatred.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.646
It's terrible.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.065
Think of us as like

07:20.066 --> 07:21.441
a two-headed dog.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.441
Mmm-hmm.

07:21.482 --> 07:22.483
And we're sitting on that

07:22.484 --> 07:23.484
River Styx in a boat...

07:23.526 --> 07:25.195
- Right, and we gotta
- take you across.

07:25.237 --> 07:26.280
You can't swim to

07:26.281 --> 07:27.322
the River Styx.

07:25.237 --> 07:27.322
No, you can't.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.050
- You can't do that. - I'd like to
- See you try it.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.658
- I wish you could try.
- I dare you.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.220
- You're going to
- burn your legs off.

07:32.244 --> 07:34.013
- But you get with us...
- You're in the boat.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.122
We take you across.

07:35.123 --> 07:36.206
We guide you to

07:34.037 --> 07:36.206
where you need to go.

07:36.248 --> 07:37.498
- We get you to hell.
- Yeah.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.521
I think the secret is,

07:39.522 --> 07:41.502
we know everything,

07:41.544 --> 07:43.255
- assume that they
- know nothing.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.048
Kids are stupid.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.175
You have to start

07:46.176 --> 07:47.259
from that point and then

07:45.090 --> 07:47.259
work your way backwards.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.344
Or forward.

07:48.345 --> 07:49.386
Forward.

07:49.428 --> 07:50.678
- Or laterally.
- Yeah.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.514
You asked when the

07:52.515 --> 07:54.308
applications are

07:50.720 --> 07:54.308
due for UCLA.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.184
- Those were - due yesterday.
- Yesterday.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.269
Yesterday.

07:57.270 --> 07:58.312
So, that is, uh...

07:56.226 --> 07:58.312
Ouch.

07:58.353 --> 07:59.789
- A no-can... - That's a no-fly zone.
- That's not good.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.669
Yeah, so, uh, forget about

08:01.670 --> 08:03.524
that one. USC tomorrow.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.506
Exactly, so, six essays,

08:05.507 --> 08:07.446
you knock 'em out tonight.

08:03.566 --> 08:07.446
You're good to go.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.863
5-Hour Energy.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.428
Pop one of those

08:10.429 --> 08:11.950
in your mouth, boom,

08:08.905 --> 08:11.950
boom, boom. You're gold.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.223
Get a get a couple

08:13.224 --> 08:14.453
of Coke Zeros and...

08:14.494 --> 08:16.121
- None
- of those calories.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.852
But you are still

08:17.853 --> 08:19.540
learning and you

08:16.163 --> 08:19.540
are still staying awake.

08:19.582 --> 08:20.667
Can she...

08:20.708 --> 08:21.793
Can she do that?

08:21.794 --> 08:22.877
You just hop out

08:20.708 --> 08:22.877
of here right now

08:22.919 --> 08:24.545
- and just start on
- that process?

08:24.587 --> 08:25.672
- She can't?
- She can't.

08:25.713 --> 08:26.983
- Okay. - Look, you
- Cram it tonight.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.607
- Tonight. You'll
- get in there tonight.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.178
The problem

08:32.179 --> 08:33.554
is that teaching

08:30.802 --> 08:33.554
is tougher today.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.307
- Because they put
- hormones in the milk,

08:35.349 --> 08:37.076
- So the girls - start to menstruate
- At a younger age.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.352
It's awful.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.687
- How do you
- know that?

08:40.727 --> 08:42.063
Morning, guys.

08:42.105 --> 08:43.335
Hey, morning, Wendy.

08:43.336 --> 08:44.565
Morning, Wendy.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.151
That's a lot of wrong

08:46.152 --> 08:47.694
answers there, Eric.

08:44.607 --> 08:47.694
Mmm-hmm.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.008
Hey, check it out,

08:49.009 --> 08:50.280
Wendy's not wearing

08:47.735 --> 08:50.280
any underpants today.

08:50.322 --> 08:51.448
Jesus, do your

08:51.449 --> 08:52.573
kids know anything?

08:52.615 --> 08:54.344
- That grading machine
- sounds like gunfire.

08:54.368 --> 08:55.994
- I am aware of
- the results, Brian.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.496
You guys are worried

08:57.497 --> 08:58.955
about tests? She's going

08:56.036 --> 08:58.955
commando. You kidding me?

08:58.997 --> 09:00.915
- Did you see
- these scores?

09:00.957 --> 09:02.271
Dude, I know you're

09:02.272 --> 09:03.584
married, but just look for

09:00.957 --> 09:03.584
my sake, would you please?

09:03.626 --> 09:05.420
The average is 14.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.023
- I can't even talk to you.
- Do you have a penis?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.861
Hey, Wendy. I brought

09:08.862 --> 09:10.675
that vanilla creamer

09:07.047 --> 09:10.675
that we both enjoy.

09:20.519 --> 09:21.561
Bam!

09:22.645 --> 09:24.772
Belly button showing!

09:24.814 --> 09:25.857
Bam!

09:28.485 --> 09:30.112
Cell phone and belly

09:30.113 --> 09:31.738
button showing, that's two.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.304
Enjoy your

09:34.305 --> 09:35.534
Saturday, with me.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.121
Uh, hey there, Marv Collins,

09:40.122 --> 09:42.582
assistant principal and dean

09:37.660 --> 09:42.582
of students at Truman High.

09:42.623 --> 09:43.624
Actually,

09:43.625 --> 09:44.625
Mr. Collins, you can

09:42.623 --> 09:44.625
just look at me.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.441
So uh, you help Principal

09:47.442 --> 09:48.963
Douche run the school.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.653
Principal Douche

09:50.654 --> 09:52.300
does not need my help

09:49.005 --> 09:52.300
running this school.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.010
I think you can tell

09:54.011 --> 09:55.678
he's doing a pretty

09:52.342 --> 09:55.678
good job all by himself.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.556
- You're not hiding the
- cell phones from me.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.140
- You know you're
- getting detention.

09:59.182 --> 10:00.826
- And you still have
- the cell phones out.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.081
No, yeah, I'm

10:02.082 --> 10:03.311
just the garbage man,

10:00.850 --> 10:03.311
you know.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.105
I take out the trash.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.397
Someone sees a future

10:06.398 --> 10:07.648
ahead of them, but you

10:05.146 --> 10:07.648
still have yours out.

10:07.690 --> 10:08.817
Put the cell phones away!

10:08.818 --> 10:09.943
Put the cell phones away!

10:09.984 --> 10:11.444
As you probably saw,

10:11.445 --> 10:12.904
we had a little kerfuffle

10:09.984 --> 10:12.904
this morning

10:12.946 --> 10:14.260
between a couple

10:14.261 --> 10:15.574
of our young men.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.492
- Uh, not
- their first go-round.

10:18.701 --> 10:19.869
But let me tell you,

10:19.870 --> 10:21.037
it better be their last.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.852
Because one

10:22.853 --> 10:24.624
more infraction, and

10:21.079 --> 10:24.624
they're out of here.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.087
♪ Uh, uh, uh, yeah, uh

10:29.129 --> 10:30.797

10:40.723 --> 10:41.723
How's that work?

10:42.725 --> 10:43.725
I don't know.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.687
- Wanna tell me
- what it was about?

10:46.729 --> 10:48.482
Nothing.

10:48.523 --> 10:49.708

Late for what?

10:57.824 --> 11:00.243
Uh, soccer practice.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.995
This is the first year

11:01.996 --> 11:03.704
Truman's fielded

11:00.285 --> 11:03.704
a varsity soccer team.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.081
Although I'm not sure

11:05.082 --> 11:06.416
you can call this soccer.

11:08.751 --> 11:09.773
I'd like to see

11:09.774 --> 11:10.795
us win a game.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.380
Or maybe just score

11:12.381 --> 11:13.923
a goal. That'd be nice.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.428
Most days I'd settle for

11:18.429 --> 11:19.678
a practice field with grass.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.477
Okay, shake it off, Derek.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.543
Hey, you're California

11:29.544 --> 11:31.732
Teacher of the Year. These

11:27.354 --> 11:31.732
guys know who you are.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.336
- What? You're telling - me that you didn't
- Recommend me?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.028
Absolutely I did,

11:35.069 --> 11:37.071
But they'd already seen

11:37.072 --> 11:39.073
the article in The Times,

11:35.069 --> 11:39.073
picture of your family.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.741
- They asked me
- about you.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.766
The National Independent

11:44.767 --> 11:46.747
School Association sent

11:42.785 --> 11:46.747
you to come get me.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.225
- This is what I'm
- telling you, yeah.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.001
To lobby for them.

11:50.002 --> 11:51.752
What the hell do

11:48.249 --> 11:51.752
I know about lobbying?

11:51.794 --> 11:53.379
Well, it's not

11:53.380 --> 11:54.964
like you'll be the

11:51.794 --> 11:54.964
only one. It's a team.

11:55.006 --> 11:56.924
- And they want to
- make an addition.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.843
A veteran teacher who's

11:58.844 --> 12:00.719
had success in both public

11:56.966 --> 12:00.719
and private classrooms.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.180
To do what?

12:02.222 --> 12:04.516
To go on TV, uh,

12:04.517 --> 12:06.809
make speeches, appear

12:02.222 --> 12:06.809
at schools, symposiums.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.958
They want you to

12:08.959 --> 12:11.064
be the new face

12:06.851 --> 12:11.064
of independent schools.

12:13.274 --> 12:16.735
And 120,000 to start.

12:19.864 --> 12:22.116
Are you... Are you serious?

12:22.659 --> 12:24.619
To start.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.455
Plus an expense account,

12:26.456 --> 12:28.248
moving expenses,

12:24.661 --> 12:28.248
unbelievable health benefits.

12:28.289 --> 12:29.790
Uh, moving expenses.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.544
To where?

12:32.586 --> 12:33.900
Well, uh, we're in D.C.

12:33.901 --> 12:35.213
about two weeks each month.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.465
Some people decide

12:36.466 --> 12:37.674
to just move out

12:35.255 --> 12:37.674
there, some don't.

12:37.716 --> 12:38.817
- Ah, D.C., I don't
- know if I can do that.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.197
Like I said, some

12:40.198 --> 12:41.553
don't. I didn't.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.315
- And you don't have
- to decide right away.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.391
So this is a job offer?

12:46.392 --> 12:47.934
It's not a job interview?

12:47.975 --> 12:51.395
Well, you're gonna

12:51.396 --> 12:54.815
have to meet with the NISA

12:47.975 --> 12:54.815
director, Ellen Behr,

12:54.857 --> 12:56.697
- but, honestly, the way
- she talks about you,

12:56.735 --> 12:58.695
- I think she just
- wants your autograph.

13:02.699 --> 13:04.427
Are you
- interested in that job?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.369
I don't know.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.537
I mean, a lot of

13:07.538 --> 13:08.663
changes to consider.

13:08.705 --> 13:12.083
Um, the travel, for one.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.925
How much
- does Truman pay you?

13:15.629 --> 13:16.869
- If you don't
- mind me asking.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.592
A little under 70.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.846
- Is that
- why you're smiling?

13:25.888 --> 13:27.369
Not just that, it's

13:27.370 --> 13:28.849
just, you know, I'm...

13:28.891 --> 13:31.081
When you teach, you kind

13:31.082 --> 13:33.271
of forget what it's like to

13:28.891 --> 13:33.271
have a real job, and um,

13:33.313 --> 13:35.064
I guess I thought maybe

13:35.065 --> 13:36.815
I'd never have another one.

13:36.857 --> 13:38.777
- You don't consider teaching
- to be a real job?

13:39.986 --> 13:41.906
- Well, you just spent
- the day with me. Do you?

13:45.325 --> 13:46.761
Oh, I'm so hungry!

13:46.785 --> 13:48.370
I'm so hungry,

13:48.371 --> 13:49.954
I want some belly,

13:46.785 --> 13:49.954
I want some belly!

13:49.996 --> 13:51.143
Mmm!

13:53.625 --> 13:55.377
Oh, the belly

13:55.378 --> 13:57.128
so good! So good!

13:57.170 --> 13:58.921
- I couldn't possibly
- eat any more belly!

13:58.963 --> 14:00.194
I'm so full.

14:00.195 --> 14:01.424
Oh, wait! Yes, I can!

14:03.134 --> 14:04.885
So, uh, what's this?

14:04.927 --> 14:06.867
Uh, the National

14:06.868 --> 14:08.807
Independent School

14:04.927 --> 14:08.807
Association website.

14:08.847 --> 14:10.183
- Who they are,
- what they do.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.436
How's it look?

14:13.478 --> 14:15.209
Oh, you know.

14:15.210 --> 14:16.939
Um, tax exemptions,

14:16.981 --> 14:19.588
uh, school vouchers, looking

14:19.589 --> 14:22.195
out for the interests of rich

14:16.981 --> 14:22.195
kids and their rich parents.

14:22.236 --> 14:23.425
It's basically everything

14:23.426 --> 14:24.614
I've ever fought against

14:22.236 --> 14:24.614
for my whole career.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.909
Nobody proofreads!

14:28.951 --> 14:30.265
This guy says his paper

14:30.266 --> 14:31.579
is about Mark Train.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.291
Unbelievable.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.751
- They're not
- all like that.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.085
Hmm.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.524
Look, Daddy, I drew

14:39.525 --> 14:40.921
a princess and she's

14:38.127 --> 14:40.921
saying, "I love you."

14:40.963 --> 14:42.549
- Aw, that's
- beautiful, angel.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.342
- You spell better than
- Daddy's students.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.552
- Stop it.
- Mmm-hmm.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.807
Listen to this.

14:50.849 --> 14:53.497
"The boy said, 'I was"

14:53.498 --> 14:56.145
hungry, hungry, hungry.'

14:50.849 --> 14:56.145
"This shows he was hungry."

14:58.815 --> 14:59.935
- Teacher of
- the Year, huh?

15:14.789 --> 15:16.457
- You know,
- I'm real happy

15:16.499 --> 15:17.729
That you guys

15:17.730 --> 15:18.959
are giving Mitch Carter

15:16.499 --> 15:18.959
all this attention

15:19.001 --> 15:20.670
and you're

15:20.671 --> 15:22.338
here to see him,

15:19.001 --> 15:22.338
but it's Ron Douche

15:22.380 --> 15:23.444
who's the motor

15:23.445 --> 15:24.507
behind this house.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.155
He's the kid in the hamster

15:26.156 --> 15:27.761
wheel, so to speak.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.325
This guy's gonna

15:29.326 --> 15:30.847
be superintendent

15:27.802 --> 15:30.847
of LA Unified.

15:30.889 --> 15:32.849
I'm hitching

15:32.850 --> 15:34.809
my wagon to that star.

15:30.889 --> 15:34.809
Best believe that.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.915
I mean, he says put

15:36.916 --> 15:38.979
this campus on lockdown,

15:34.851 --> 15:38.979
it's locked down.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.836
Miss Curtis, Nia

15:40.837 --> 15:42.650
cannot come to school

15:39.021 --> 15:42.650
dressed like this.

15:42.692 --> 15:43.735
Why not? She

15:43.736 --> 15:44.778
looks good.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.696
Nia, you can't...

15:46.697 --> 15:48.573
Look at your skirt.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.616
Leave something

15:49.617 --> 15:50.617
to the imagination.

15:50.658 --> 15:51.826
Why should I make

15:51.827 --> 15:52.993
them imagine it when

15:50.658 --> 15:52.993
I can just show it to them?

15:53.035 --> 15:55.013
- You know, but, - I've had enough
- Of this, all right?

15:55.037 --> 15:56.997
- She is beautiful.
- I am beautiful.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.479
I was a JV cheerleader

15:58.480 --> 15:59.918
when I had her. All right?

15:59.959 --> 16:01.669
That out of here.

16:01.711 --> 16:05.005
Uh, uh... Uh, yes.

16:06.173 --> 16:07.467
Okay, let's get started.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.010
I have your Huck Finn

16:09.011 --> 16:10.511
papers for you,

16:10.553 --> 16:12.076
and, uh, I see that

16:12.077 --> 16:13.598
a lot of you are still

16:10.553 --> 16:13.598
making the same mistakes

16:13.640 --> 16:15.058
because you

16:15.059 --> 16:16.476
refuse to proofread.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.394
Uh, look, if it's

16:18.395 --> 16:20.271
a problem with spelling

16:16.517 --> 16:20.271
or vocabulary,

16:20.313 --> 16:22.002
I can help you with that,

16:22.003 --> 16:23.691
but when the name of the

16:20.313 --> 16:23.691
book is Huckleberry Finn

16:23.733 --> 16:25.526
- and you spell
- Huckleberry wrong...

16:27.278 --> 16:28.467
I can't do anything for

16:28.468 --> 16:29.656
you there. Or you spell

16:27.278 --> 16:29.656
your own name wrong?

16:30.782 --> 16:31.804
Come on, Mr. Carter,

16:31.805 --> 16:32.826
nobody did that.

16:32.867 --> 16:34.473
Oh, no, yeah, somebody

16:34.474 --> 16:36.078
did, Marcus, or should

16:32.867 --> 16:36.078
I call you "Macrus."

16:40.082 --> 16:41.563
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:41.564 --> 16:43.043
in the eyes of the law,

16:40.082 --> 16:43.043
you are still children

16:43.085 --> 16:44.566
but here, in this

16:44.567 --> 16:46.046
classroom, you are adults.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.966
- So as much as I may
- disagree with you,

16:48.007 --> 16:49.029
I have to respect

16:49.030 --> 16:50.050
your decision not

16:48.007 --> 16:50.050
to get smarter.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.740
This is America, where

16:51.741 --> 16:53.387
the Constitution protects

16:50.092 --> 16:53.387
your right to stay dumb.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.919
"Brendan had a bellyache"

17:03.920 --> 17:06.066
and had to get more sleep.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.528
"Please execute him."

17:10.613 --> 17:13.449
I wish I could, Novak.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.284
Wait, so you guys are

17:15.285 --> 17:17.077
here because Mitch Carter

17:13.491 --> 17:17.077
won Teacher of the Year?

17:17.118 --> 17:19.319
- Wow, I, I didn't even know
- a decision had been made.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.021
I guess I was busy

17:23.021 --> 17:24.627
then. And that's

17:21.415 --> 17:24.627
for the whole city?

17:24.669 --> 17:26.295
Whole state.

17:26.337 --> 17:27.547
Whole state. Okay, that's...

17:27.548 --> 17:28.756
He's a good guy.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.301
Really nice cat.

17:32.343 --> 17:33.719
Can I speak frankly for a

17:33.720 --> 17:35.095
second, because I'm sorry,

17:35.137 --> 17:37.223
but he teaches English.

17:37.264 --> 17:38.682
Okay, that's a dead language.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.100
The kids already speak it

17:37.264 --> 17:40.100
when they come to school.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.373
I'm dealing with

17:41.374 --> 17:42.603
the future. It's robotics.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.397
I mean, in my class

17:44.398 --> 17:46.148
on Monday, it's Wednesday.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.028
- All right, let's
- assimilate.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.634
All right, now you guys

17:52.635 --> 17:53.990
have won the last four

17:51.278 --> 17:53.990
city championships

17:54.032 --> 17:55.952
- and today we're going
- to make it number five.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.452
But more importantly,

17:57.453 --> 17:58.912
when the robots take over,

17:58.953 --> 18:00.079
and that day's coming

18:00.080 --> 18:01.205
sooner than people think,

18:01.247 --> 18:02.686
you guys are

18:02.687 --> 18:04.124
going to be ready.

18:04.166 --> 18:05.981
And you're going

18:05.982 --> 18:07.795
to be waiting for them,

18:04.166 --> 18:07.795
just like me. Okay?

18:09.171 --> 18:10.171
Let's fuse.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.890
Four years in a row

18:18.891 --> 18:20.349
we've lost the National

18:17.430 --> 18:20.349
Robot Championships,

18:20.391 --> 18:21.767
otherwise referred to as

18:21.768 --> 18:23.143
the Super-Robot Bowl.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.063
Today's the cities,

18:25.064 --> 18:26.940
city robots, we

18:23.185 --> 18:26.940
always rule that.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.942
- And state robots,
- we fly through.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.547
We've had problems with

18:30.548 --> 18:32.111
the national robots.

18:33.195 --> 18:34.697
Not this year.

18:34.698 --> 18:36.198
Not this year.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.911
I guess, I mean,

18:40.912 --> 18:42.162
I'm just a little disappointed

18:39.660 --> 18:42.162
in your behavior.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.706
I mean, aren't you?

18:43.748 --> 18:45.165
Yes, Mr. Douche.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.560
- And if I suspend - you, you're just
- Going to feel like

18:46.584 --> 18:48.270
- You're getting an extra
- week of spring break.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.272
- So instead, you're - gonna have a week
- Of in-house suspension.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.422
- Are you...
- Uh-uh-uh...

18:54.717 --> 18:56.323
Now, Mr. Carter believes

18:56.324 --> 18:57.929
that soccer's been

18:54.717 --> 18:57.929
a good outlet for you.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.597
Yeah. Yes.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.078
He also feels that, uh,

19:01.079 --> 19:02.516
you should be allowed to

18:59.639 --> 19:02.516
continue playing and I agree.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.226
- Thank you, Mr. Douche,
- thank you.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.186
- But he has also
- promised me

19:06.228 --> 19:07.480
He'd have you

19:07.481 --> 19:08.731
run sprints for

19:06.228 --> 19:08.731
an extra 20 minutes

19:08.773 --> 19:10.208
- after practice
- every day next week.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.400
Are you...

19:11.401 --> 19:12.568
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

19:14.862 --> 19:15.905
Now take a pretzel.

19:19.951 --> 19:21.202
Not in here.

19:21.203 --> 19:22.453
Alex, crumbs.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.165
Jeez.

19:29.543 --> 19:30.586
There's not a lot of

19:30.587 --> 19:31.629
time during the day

19:31.671 --> 19:33.173
to teach a young man or

19:33.174 --> 19:34.674
woman a lesson like that.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.780
So, hopefully I got

19:36.781 --> 19:38.845
through to him, made

19:34.715 --> 19:38.845
a difference in his life.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.513
That guy's a dick.

19:49.939 --> 19:51.732
- Seriously, like,
- these are not lockers.

19:51.774 --> 19:54.819
This is for mail,

19:54.820 --> 19:57.864
and news, and bug spray...

19:51.774 --> 19:57.864
I'm just...

19:57.905 --> 19:59.573
What's up, Ian?

19:59.615 --> 20:00.804
Oh, hey, Steven,

20:00.805 --> 20:01.993
just got The Titan

19:59.615 --> 20:01.993
hot off the presses.

20:02.035 --> 20:03.243
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.014
- Yeah, you guys are - doing some great
- Work down there.

20:05.038 --> 20:06.310
Yeah, you gotta check out

20:06.311 --> 20:07.581
the piece we did on the

20:05.038 --> 20:07.581
water fountain in the gym.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.542
- Yeah, we tested
- it for bacteria.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.293
- Covered in
- microorganisms.

20:11.335 --> 20:13.271
- That's fantastic. How - long have you been
- Teaching here?

20:13.295 --> 20:14.526
Uh, this is my

20:14.527 --> 20:15.756
first year.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.756
My first full year.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.359
- Almost a full year. - Started as a sub
- Last year, yeah.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.384
This is great.

20:18.385 --> 20:19.385
I'm really making

20:17.383 --> 20:19.385
the paper my thing.

20:19.426 --> 20:21.279
- I'm really proud of what - the students are doing.
- Yeah. Super.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.076
And I'd like to think...

20:23.077 --> 20:24.849
That article about

20:21.303 --> 20:24.849
Kathy Bannen's puppy?

20:24.891 --> 20:26.475
- Yeah, yeah, that's
- gonna be great.

20:26.517 --> 20:27.643
It'll teach a lot of

20:27.644 --> 20:28.769
kids responsibility

20:28.811 --> 20:30.041
about taking care

20:30.042 --> 20:31.271
of puppies and stuff,

20:28.811 --> 20:31.271
and that's, uh,

20:31.313 --> 20:33.191
- something the kids
- need to learn about

20:33.232 --> 20:34.588
Before they go

20:34.589 --> 20:35.943
on to college.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.943
Fantastic stuff.

20:35.985 --> 20:37.195
Good job, Ian.

20:38.696 --> 20:39.864
Thanks, um...

20:42.324 --> 20:43.886
- What's - happening, kids?
- Hey, man.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.015
Looking at our

20:45.016 --> 20:46.120
conference schedules. Who

20:43.910 --> 20:46.120
do you have this year?

20:46.162 --> 20:47.872
- I don't know,
- what's it matter?

20:47.914 --> 20:49.808
- "Why is my kid an idiot?" - "'Cause you're an idiot."
- In and out.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.002
You're serious?

20:53.044 --> 20:54.312
- Am I the
- only one who does that?

20:54.336 --> 20:55.295
That's genius.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.773
What, do you
- actually take time?

20:56.797 --> 20:58.150
- That's just wrong, - not genius.
- That's a good idea.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.317
- That's a brilliant
- idea, is what that is.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.777
- It's actually a
- pretty good idea.

21:00.801 --> 21:01.823
Yeah, Teacher of

21:01.824 --> 21:02.845
the Year, right there.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.845
There you go.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.096
Where's my vest? Oh!

21:04.097 --> 21:05.305
Where's my vest?

21:05.347 --> 21:07.307
I'm the vest guy.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.186
- It's fun to joke
- around in the lounge.

21:11.729 --> 21:13.773
But I love this job.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.086
I love the kids,

21:15.087 --> 21:16.358
I love math.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.673
Um, most days I cannot

21:17.674 --> 21:18.945
wait to get to work.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.821
The magic math hat

21:20.822 --> 21:22.656
goes to Lamont.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.701
Yay, yes, thank you,

21:25.702 --> 21:27.327
thank you,

21:24.075 --> 21:27.327
please, please.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.830
Thank

21:29.831 --> 21:32.291
you, Lamont, thank you so much

21:27.369 --> 21:32.291
for being so smart.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.295
But I have to ask,

21:36.336 --> 21:38.839
what is the mnemonic

21:38.840 --> 21:41.341
device, sohcahtoa?

21:43.343 --> 21:45.155
- I'm fired up - about teaching.
- I do it with passion.

21:45.179 --> 21:46.806
I don't apologize for it.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.537
And I expect my

21:48.538 --> 21:50.226
students to match my

21:46.847 --> 21:50.226
passion with their own.

21:50.268 --> 21:51.852
- I think they
- appreciate the effort.

21:51.894 --> 21:53.729
- At the very least
- they're entertained.

21:53.771 --> 21:55.148
- Emmie?
- Cosine.

21:55.189 --> 21:57.254
Cosine, cosine!

21:59.359 --> 22:00.879
- Are you rolling now?
- Yeah.

22:00.903 --> 22:02.613
That is so cool.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.074
I mean...

22:06.408 --> 22:07.768
- It's like...
- It's like we're...

22:10.079 --> 22:11.518
It's like Spinal Tap

22:11.519 --> 22:12.957
or something.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.187
It's like we're just

22:14.188 --> 22:15.375
teaching and you

22:12.999 --> 22:15.375
guys are filming.

22:15.417 --> 22:16.877
It's a little creepy, but...

22:20.653 --> 22:22.842
I take my teaching, and I

22:18.462 --> 22:22.842
turn it up to 11. To 11.

22:22.883 --> 22:24.844
I was never really good

22:24.845 --> 22:26.804
at accents, but...

22:22.883 --> 22:26.804
Eleven... No?

22:26.846 --> 22:28.556
You don't know

22:28.557 --> 22:30.266
Spinal Tap? Wow.

22:30.308 --> 22:32.228
- I say turn down the job.
- Are you nuts?

22:32.268 --> 22:33.954
- Teaching's his calling.
- Take the money.

22:33.978 --> 22:35.146
Teaching's obviously

22:35.147 --> 22:36.314
not about cash, it

22:33.978 --> 22:36.314
elevates the spirit.

22:36.354 --> 22:37.856
Oh, my God, do not listen

22:37.857 --> 22:39.357
to him, Mitch, this is just

22:36.354 --> 22:39.357
Berkeley jibber-jabber.

22:39.399 --> 22:40.877
Why are you - so mean to me?

22:40.901 --> 22:42.007
Because I can be,

22:42.008 --> 22:43.112
and I'm older

22:40.901 --> 22:43.112
than you, all right?

22:43.154 --> 22:44.801
Look, 10 years from now

22:44.802 --> 22:46.448
you'll be making almost

22:43.154 --> 22:46.448
the same as you do now.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.426
- And you'll be - killing yourself for
- Not taking this job.

22:48.450 --> 22:49.618
Why is this the only

22:49.619 --> 22:50.786
way for me to make

22:48.450 --> 22:50.786
this kind of money?

22:50.828 --> 22:52.600
I love teaching, you know,

22:52.601 --> 22:54.372
apparently other people think

22:50.828 --> 22:54.372
I'm pretty good at it, too.

22:54.414 --> 22:55.851
- Why can't I make
- 100 grand doing this?

22:55.875 --> 22:57.647
Because you can't.

22:57.648 --> 22:59.419
Take the money.

22:59.461 --> 23:00.671
If I'm coming on strong,

23:00.672 --> 23:01.881
that's not my intention.

23:01.922 --> 23:04.174
I just feel really confident

23:04.175 --> 23:06.426
that advertising with us is

23:01.922 --> 23:06.426
gonna help your business.

23:06.468 --> 23:07.949
I'm the sales director

23:07.950 --> 23:09.429
at a local

23:06.468 --> 23:09.429
mixed media company.

23:09.471 --> 23:10.952
They let me work from

23:10.953 --> 23:12.432
home three days a week,

23:09.471 --> 23:12.432
which is really helpful.

23:12.474 --> 23:13.955
If we are right

23:13.956 --> 23:15.435
for you, then we are

23:12.474 --> 23:15.435
perfect for you.

23:15.477 --> 23:16.791
You know, we just

23:16.792 --> 23:18.105
want to meet your needs.

23:18.147 --> 23:19.753
That's all. If you're

23:19.754 --> 23:21.359
not happy, if it's not

23:18.147 --> 23:21.359
working for you,

23:21.399 --> 23:22.526
then I'm

23:22.527 --> 23:23.652
not doing my job.

23:23.694 --> 23:26.050
Yeah, I'm not interested

23:26.051 --> 23:28.406
in just making this sale

23:23.694 --> 23:28.406
and leaving you hanging.

23:28.448 --> 23:29.992
No, I'm gonna use

23:29.993 --> 23:31.535
my customized software

23:28.448 --> 23:31.535
to monitor your account

23:31.577 --> 23:33.016
and make sure that your ad

23:33.017 --> 23:34.454
is generating sales.

23:36.165 --> 23:37.312
Yeah. Oh, gosh,

23:37.313 --> 23:38.458
it's unbelievable.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.211
It tells us who's noticing

23:40.212 --> 23:41.921
your ad, where they're

23:38.500 --> 23:41.921
shopping, what they're buying.

23:43.297 --> 23:44.882
I can do that.

23:44.883 --> 23:46.466
Yes, I can do that.

23:46.508 --> 23:47.968
I can do that, too,

23:47.969 --> 23:49.427
that sounds very fair.

23:49.469 --> 23:51.075
It is a lot to promise but

23:51.076 --> 23:52.681
I hope that shows you how

23:49.469 --> 23:52.681
much I want your business.

23:54.892 --> 23:56.476
Okay.

23:56.518 --> 23:57.707
All right, I'll send

23:57.708 --> 23:58.896
the contracts over first

23:56.518 --> 23:58.896
thing in the morning.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.440
Okay. Thank you.

24:04.402 --> 24:05.403
Bye-bye.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.573
Yay.

24:11.491 --> 24:13.348
Mitch, I admire your

24:13.349 --> 24:15.204
success in both the public

24:11.491 --> 24:15.204
and private sectors.

24:15.246 --> 24:16.977
And I think your career

24:16.978 --> 24:18.707
highlights the best qualities

24:15.246 --> 24:18.707
of independent schools.

24:18.749 --> 24:20.022
Well, come on,

24:20.023 --> 24:21.294
you can't really compare

24:18.749 --> 24:21.294
Harry Truman Charter

24:21.335 --> 24:22.502
to Episcopal Academy.

24:22.544 --> 24:24.255
- Charter schools
- walk the line.

24:24.297 --> 24:25.652
They're public schools that

24:25.653 --> 24:27.007
take advantage of many

24:24.297 --> 24:27.007
of private schools' benefits.

24:27.049 --> 24:28.050
Private and charter

24:28.051 --> 24:29.051
are practically

24:27.049 --> 24:29.051
the same thing.

24:29.093 --> 24:30.386
That's a very difficult

24:30.387 --> 24:31.678
argument to make, Miss Behr.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.471
- I couldn't agree
- with you more.

24:35.182 --> 24:36.267
How would you make it?

24:38.060 --> 24:40.478
Well, um, let's see.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.111
They both have entry

24:47.112 --> 24:48.654
requirements greater

24:45.567 --> 24:48.654
than residency.

24:48.695 --> 24:50.656
Uh, they both ask for a

24:50.657 --> 24:52.616
personal commitment of

24:48.695 --> 24:52.616
time or money or both

24:52.658 --> 24:54.347
from the student,

24:54.348 --> 24:56.036
and frequently from the

24:52.658 --> 24:56.036
student's family.

24:56.078 --> 24:57.955
As a society, we choose

24:57.956 --> 24:59.832
to spend tax dollars

24:56.078 --> 24:59.832
on enrollment and fees

24:59.873 --> 25:01.499
- at charter schools
- like Truman High.

25:01.541 --> 25:02.981
There is no reason why

25:02.982 --> 25:04.420
a few of those tax dollars

25:04.462 --> 25:05.609
couldn't go to private

25:05.610 --> 25:06.755
school tuitions as well.

25:06.797 --> 25:07.986
Even if it's

25:07.987 --> 25:09.175
not as much.

25:09.216 --> 25:11.302
A fraction.

25:11.344 --> 25:12.699
So, you can make

25:12.700 --> 25:14.054
that argument.

25:14.096 --> 25:16.348
Yes, ma'am.

25:16.349 --> 25:18.600
Yeah, would appear so.

25:23.521 --> 25:25.334
So, - does that mean you
- Want the job now?

25:25.358 --> 25:26.922
No, no, it just means

25:26.923 --> 25:28.486
I know I can do it. I...

25:30.612 --> 25:31.780
What the hell?

25:39.455 --> 25:40.477
Brian, what's

25:40.478 --> 25:41.499
going on, man?

25:41.539 --> 25:43.125
I got a problem.

25:43.167 --> 25:44.335
What, what's happening?

25:44.336 --> 25:45.503
Ron suspended me today.

25:45.543 --> 25:46.795
What? Why?

25:46.837 --> 25:48.213
Faith Gregory accused

25:48.214 --> 25:49.589
me of attacking her

25:46.837 --> 25:49.589
in tutorial today,

25:49.631 --> 25:51.008
- and you know
- I did not do that.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.610
- No, no, of course,
- I know, I know, I know.

25:52.634 --> 25:53.990
Guys, please, just

25:53.991 --> 25:55.346
give me a second,

25:52.634 --> 25:55.346
all right, please?

25:55.388 --> 25:56.680
Just back off, please.

26:00.017 --> 26:01.310
She's an angry child,

26:01.311 --> 26:02.602
there has to be something

26:00.017 --> 26:02.602
going on at home,

26:02.644 --> 26:03.854
and it's important...

26:03.896 --> 26:05.248
- All right, have you - heard from her
- Parents at all?

26:05.272 --> 26:06.791
- No. - Have you talked, spoken
- To her mother or father?

26:06.815 --> 26:08.626
- No, the mother, - I know has been
- In contact with Ron

26:08.650 --> 26:09.672
But... And the

26:09.673 --> 26:10.694
worst part about it...

26:10.736 --> 26:12.321
Oh, this is bad,

26:12.322 --> 26:13.906
this is so bad.

26:10.736 --> 26:13.906
Brian's in a tough spot.

26:13.947 --> 26:14.969
Why'd

26:14.970 --> 26:15.991
he come to you?

26:16.033 --> 26:17.326
I'm the union rep

26:17.327 --> 26:18.618
at our school, so he's

26:16.033 --> 26:18.618
supposed to come to me.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.079
Plus, we're friends.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.497
Good friends.

26:21.539 --> 26:22.899
- We'll talk
- tomorrow, all right?

26:30.714 --> 26:32.049
Who is this girl?

26:32.050 --> 26:33.384
This is unbelievable.

26:33.426 --> 26:35.198
Her name is Faith

26:35.199 --> 26:36.970
Gregory, and, uh, he

26:33.426 --> 26:36.970
failed her last semester.

26:37.012 --> 26:38.618
He was trying to help her.

26:38.619 --> 26:40.224
I mean, that's why she was

26:37.012 --> 26:40.224
in his room to begin with.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.164
Well, can't Ron at least wait

26:42.165 --> 26:44.061
until he hears the story

26:40.266 --> 26:44.061
from everybody else first?

26:44.103 --> 26:45.542
No, he can't afford

26:45.543 --> 26:46.980
to, Kate. I mean,

26:44.103 --> 26:46.980
what if Brian did it?

26:47.981 --> 26:49.275
You think he did it?

26:49.316 --> 26:50.484
No, of course not,

26:50.485 --> 26:51.651
but, you know,

26:51.693 --> 26:53.611
- Ron's just got to
- cover his ass.

26:53.653 --> 26:55.948
Mitch, language, please.

26:55.989 --> 26:57.533
Oh, sorry, hey, sweetie, can

26:57.534 --> 26:59.076
you go to your room and

26:55.989 --> 26:59.076
play for a little bit, please?

26:59.118 --> 27:00.140
Okay, Daddy.

27:00.141 --> 27:01.161
Thank you.

27:01.203 --> 27:02.805
- I'll be in to read you
- a book in a little bit.

27:02.829 --> 27:04.290
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:05.707 --> 27:06.875
Can I say "ass" now?

27:07.876 --> 27:09.128
Oh, my gosh,

27:09.129 --> 27:10.379
Jackie is pregnant.

27:10.421 --> 27:11.713
- How is she
- handling this?

27:11.755 --> 27:13.215
I don't know, he's

27:13.216 --> 27:14.674
gonna give me a call

27:11.755 --> 27:14.674
after he told her.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.676
- He hasn't
- told her yet?

27:16.718 --> 27:18.596
Well, it's not like I'd

27:18.597 --> 27:20.473
be rushing home to share

27:16.718 --> 27:20.473
the news with you either.

27:20.722 --> 27:22.640
Huh.

27:22.682 --> 27:23.830
Oh, my gosh,

27:23.831 --> 27:24.977
that is beautiful.

27:25.018 --> 27:26.186
Man.

27:26.228 --> 27:27.563
Oh, it's got a pool.

27:27.605 --> 27:28.794
A pool, we

27:28.795 --> 27:29.982
can go swim!

27:30.023 --> 27:32.192
3,200 square feet, four

27:32.193 --> 27:34.361
bedrooms, four baths,

27:34.403 --> 27:36.551
and it is $414,000.

27:36.552 --> 27:38.698
No.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.471
That could get

27:40.472 --> 27:42.202
us a garage here...

27:42.244 --> 27:43.661
That's quite...

27:43.703 --> 27:44.931
- ...in Los Angeles.
- That's unbelievable.

27:44.955 --> 27:46.582
A big difference

27:46.583 --> 27:48.208
from what we pay here.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.981
I don't know, it sounds

27:49.982 --> 27:51.711
like the interview went well,

27:51.753 --> 27:53.589
but, also, like, there's

27:53.590 --> 27:55.424
gonna be way more

27:51.753 --> 27:55.424
travel than we expected.

27:57.050 --> 27:58.864
And, uh, even if we do move

27:58.865 --> 28:00.678
to Washington, D.C.,

27:57.050 --> 28:00.678
he's gonna be gone a lot.

28:03.723 --> 28:05.017
He and Sierra have never

28:05.018 --> 28:06.310
even been apart for one day,

28:06.352 --> 28:07.603
so I'm not exactly sure

28:07.604 --> 28:08.854
how she's gonna take that,

28:11.398 --> 28:12.566
but I don't even think

28:12.567 --> 28:13.733
we really have a choice.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.256
You know, my job

28:15.257 --> 28:16.736
sucks, and, uh,

28:16.778 --> 28:17.946
I can barely handle that

28:17.947 --> 28:19.114
with one baby, much less two.

28:21.992 --> 28:23.535
I mean, when are we gonna

28:23.536 --> 28:25.078
get another opportunity

28:21.992 --> 28:25.078
like this, you know?

28:33.253 --> 28:34.547
Is it a boy?

28:35.422 --> 28:36.840
Don't start that.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.342
Oh, come on,

28:38.343 --> 28:39.801
I'm just asking.

28:36.882 --> 28:39.801
Does it feel boyish?

28:39.843 --> 28:41.803
I'm at

28:41.804 --> 28:43.763
six weeks, it doesn't

28:39.843 --> 28:43.763
feel like anything yet.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.669
Um, okay, guys, let's

28:52.670 --> 28:55.442
just wrap for the night.

28:49.895 --> 28:55.442
Okay, thank you.

We'll do that later.

29:30.666 --> 29:32.020
We will do that

29:29.309 --> 29:32.020
later, young man.

29:32.062 --> 29:33.707
- Go back to your
- Office, Douche!

29:33.731 --> 29:35.691
Who said that?

29:35.692 --> 29:37.651
You there, I see you.

29:37.693 --> 29:38.840
Yeah, Mitch found out

29:38.841 --> 29:39.986
that Truman was looking

29:37.693 --> 29:39.986
for new department chairs,

29:40.028 --> 29:41.821
- and we applied
- at the same time.

29:41.863 --> 29:43.177
Why leave

29:43.178 --> 29:44.491
a private school like

29:41.863 --> 29:44.491
Episcopal to come here?

29:44.533 --> 29:47.036
I think Mitch was looking

29:47.037 --> 29:49.538
for the challenge of starting

29:44.533 --> 29:49.538
a school from day one.

29:49.580 --> 29:51.380
- Me, I just came 'cause
- the pay was better.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.293
Any regrets?

29:54.334 --> 29:55.565
The kids at Episcopal

29:55.566 --> 29:56.795
were more gifted.

29:54.334 --> 29:56.795
I miss that.

29:57.879 --> 29:59.026
I mean, you saw

29:59.027 --> 30:00.173
my class today.

30:00.215 --> 30:02.092
Okay, yesterday, we talked

30:02.093 --> 30:03.969
about motors and motion.

30:04.010 --> 30:05.428
Can anyone name

30:05.429 --> 30:06.846
something that

30:04.010 --> 30:06.846
has a motor?

30:06.888 --> 30:08.265
Motorboat?

30:08.307 --> 30:09.579
Yes, a motorboat

30:09.580 --> 30:10.850
does have a motor.

30:10.892 --> 30:12.018
Anybody else?

30:13.270 --> 30:14.772
- Fandra?
- A vibrator?

30:21.196 --> 30:22.279
Yeah, that's great.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.239
- Look, my best
- students are fantastic.

30:24.281 --> 30:25.699
They'll go on to

30:25.700 --> 30:27.117
UCLA, Stanford,

30:24.281 --> 30:27.117
and they'll be great.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.050
- But some of these
- other kids, I, uh...

30:31.455 --> 30:32.664
I am just at a loss to

30:32.665 --> 30:33.873
explain their behavior.

30:33.915 --> 30:35.334
- We're gonna watch
- a short film.

30:35.375 --> 30:36.418
Is this a physics movie,

30:36.419 --> 30:37.461
or a good movie?

30:39.087 --> 30:40.255
Yes, Lamont, today we're

30:40.256 --> 30:41.423
going to watch Scarface.

30:45.927 --> 30:47.346
- It can be
- tough sometimes.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.850
Very tough.

30:51.891 --> 30:53.790
I'm not saying you're

30:53.791 --> 30:55.688
an idiot. I'm saying what

30:51.891 --> 30:55.688
you're saying is idiotic.

30:55.729 --> 30:57.356
- Well,
- I don't see what's...

30:57.397 --> 30:59.107
If somebody believes that

30:59.149 --> 31:00.296
they're born in

31:00.297 --> 31:01.443
the light of Uranus

30:59.149 --> 31:01.443
and they think it means...

31:03.446 --> 31:05.405
Oh, come on.

31:01.485 --> 31:05.405
That is way too easy.

31:05.447 --> 31:06.761
You know what? I get that joke

31:06.762 --> 31:08.074
too much. Don't even go there.

31:08.116 --> 31:09.451
Okay, I get that too much,

31:09.452 --> 31:10.786
look, don't even go there.

31:10.828 --> 31:12.788
- How does that hurt
- anyone's feelings?

31:12.830 --> 31:15.150
- Have you seen
- Ursula Featherstone's class?

31:16.583 --> 31:18.251
It's unusual.

31:18.293 --> 31:19.690
Okay, our quarterly

31:19.691 --> 31:21.087
test is tomorrow,

31:21.129 --> 31:22.464
and I think the best way for

31:22.465 --> 31:23.799
us to review our two books,

31:23.841 --> 31:25.905
The Miracle Worker, about

31:25.906 --> 31:27.969
Helen Keller, and The Diary of

31:23.841 --> 31:27.969
Anne Frank, is through song.

31:28.846 --> 31:29.847
So here we go.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.927
♪ Wa-wa

32:09.511 --> 32:12.681
♪ Wa-wa ♪

32:12.723 --> 32:13.828
And

32:13.829 --> 32:14.933
you're her supervisor?

32:12.723 --> 32:14.933
Yeah.

32:14.974 --> 32:16.476
Yeah, um, so yeah,

32:16.477 --> 32:17.977
I've sat through her

32:14.974 --> 32:17.977
class many times

32:18.019 --> 32:19.229
and, I gotta tell you,

32:19.230 --> 32:20.439
even though it is unusual,

32:20.480 --> 32:21.731
her kids retain a lot

32:21.732 --> 32:22.982
of what she teaches them.

32:23.024 --> 32:25.086
- And her tests scores, they
- always show improvement.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.838
- This is what I'm trying
- to tell you, you know,

32:26.862 --> 32:28.134
Each teacher reaches

32:28.135 --> 32:29.406
the kids in their own way.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.220
Um, there's no one

32:31.221 --> 32:32.992
way to do this job.

32:33.034 --> 32:34.432
You're always looking for

32:34.433 --> 32:35.829
the new, better, shinier way

32:35.871 --> 32:37.310
to deliver basically

32:37.311 --> 32:38.749
the same old message.

32:38.791 --> 32:40.396
You know, the thing is,

32:40.397 --> 32:42.001
if the message is solid,

32:42.043 --> 32:43.587
it's always worth learning.

32:43.629 --> 32:44.630
Okay, guys,

32:44.631 --> 32:45.631
how are you?

32:45.672 --> 32:47.654
How's everybody doing?

32:47.655 --> 32:49.635
We are the Hammer brothers.

32:45.672 --> 32:49.635
My name is Clive Hammer.

32:49.676 --> 32:50.844
I am Lowell Hammer.

32:50.845 --> 32:52.011
We like to bring

32:49.676 --> 32:52.011
the hammer.

32:52.053 --> 32:54.013
- Stop.
- Hammer time.

32:54.055 --> 32:55.784
- Which is what we said. - That's how long
- We've been doing it.

32:55.808 --> 32:57.034
- We've been doing
- it for years, guys.

32:57.058 --> 32:59.018
- So, you probably don't
- remember MC Hammer,

32:59.060 --> 33:00.938
- But we've been doing
- it back since his day.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.063
- Yeah, when
- he had a day.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.231
And, uh...

33:03.273 --> 33:04.900
Think of us as liaisons

33:04.901 --> 33:06.526
between you and college,

33:06.568 --> 33:07.945
and some of you

33:07.946 --> 33:09.321
might not know

33:06.568 --> 33:09.321
what liaison means.

33:09.362 --> 33:11.072
- But we are college
- counselors.

33:11.114 --> 33:12.574
Think of us as the

33:12.575 --> 33:14.033
people who define the

33:11.114 --> 33:14.033
word "liaison" for you.

33:14.075 --> 33:15.598
I asked for help with

33:15.599 --> 33:17.120
my financial aid application,

33:17.162 --> 33:18.747
and they told me to mark

33:18.748 --> 33:20.332
my ethnicity as caramel.

33:20.373 --> 33:22.041
- Caramel. - Why wouldn't
- We do our job?

33:22.083 --> 33:23.418
- Who doesn't
- like caramel?

33:23.460 --> 33:25.378
Everyone loves caramel.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.064
- You see caramel on an - application, you're like,
- "I want a piece of that."

33:27.088 --> 33:29.066
- You hear that word...
- I want a piece of that...

33:29.090 --> 33:30.175
...you start to salivate.

33:30.216 --> 33:31.864
Right? Pavlovian,

33:31.865 --> 33:33.512
you salivate, kid's in.

33:35.221 --> 33:36.932
They said that if I want

33:36.933 --> 33:38.642
to go to Stanford,

33:35.221 --> 33:38.642
I have to wear more hats.

33:38.684 --> 33:39.872
They said Stanford

33:39.873 --> 33:41.060
likes "hat people."

33:41.102 --> 33:42.228
Palo Alto's a hat town.

33:42.270 --> 33:43.480
Stanford is like

33:43.481 --> 33:44.690
a huge hat school.

33:42.270 --> 33:44.690
Yeah.

33:44.731 --> 33:45.899
I mean, you're

33:45.900 --> 33:47.066
not wearing a hat,

33:44.731 --> 33:47.066
you're not fitting in.

33:47.108 --> 33:48.401
- And if you
- don't know that,

33:48.443 --> 33:50.028
Then you're not

33:50.029 --> 33:51.613
doing your job as

33:48.443 --> 33:51.613
a college counselor.

33:51.655 --> 33:53.365
They said colleges

33:53.366 --> 33:55.074
would like me better

33:51.655 --> 33:55.074
if I lost 60 pounds.

33:55.116 --> 33:57.953
So, I'm bulimic now.

33:57.995 --> 33:59.476
But it's for my education,

33:59.477 --> 34:00.956
so it's okay.

34:02.123 --> 34:03.082
That was unfortunate.

34:03.124 --> 34:04.605
That was not our plan.

34:04.606 --> 34:06.085
That was not a great...

34:06.127 --> 34:08.087
I mean, she just kept...

34:08.129 --> 34:09.485
But if you look at her

34:09.485 --> 34:10.841
now, look at her now,

34:08.129 --> 34:10.841
she looks pretty good.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.091
If she just keeps it...

34:12.132 --> 34:13.319
- If she doesn't
- go any further...

34:13.342 --> 34:14.761
She's good.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.114
- You don't need - any of these
- States right here.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.181
Yeah, forget these

34:19.183 --> 34:20.225
states, these are just

34:18.139 --> 34:20.225
full of fat, mad people.

34:20.266 --> 34:21.518
That's right.

34:21.518 --> 34:22.768
You see these states?

34:20.266 --> 34:22.768
Fat, angry people.

34:22.811 --> 34:24.083
As you can see

34:24.083 --> 34:25.355
right in here,

34:22.811 --> 34:25.355
this is the Big Ten.

34:25.397 --> 34:26.523
Lot of football.

34:26.565 --> 34:27.774
Lot of drinking.

34:27.815 --> 34:29.108
Lot of keg stands.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.652
- This is where
- you want to be.

34:30.694 --> 34:32.612
- So, I mean, that is
- college right there.

34:32.654 --> 34:34.112
- Yeah, if you think
- about college,

34:34.155 --> 34:35.302
Think about a guy

34:35.303 --> 34:36.449
passed out in a bush...

34:36.491 --> 34:37.659
Urinating on himself.

34:37.659 --> 34:38.827
All over his own pants.

34:38.869 --> 34:39.891
Like a homeless

34:39.891 --> 34:40.913
person would.

34:40.954 --> 34:42.873
- That's University of
- Illinois right there.

34:42.915 --> 34:44.541
- That is literally...
- In a nutshell.

34:44.583 --> 34:45.772
On the crest,

34:45.773 --> 34:46.960
that is what it is.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.960
Mmm-hmm.

34:47.002 --> 34:48.170
And then also,

34:48.170 --> 34:49.337
we're out here, guys.

34:47.002 --> 34:49.337
We're in California.

34:49.379 --> 34:51.130
- You can stay
- here at home.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.817
- If you don't want to go - all the way out over
- Here, stay here at home.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.092
- Why?
- Three words.

34:54.132 --> 34:56.636
Weed is legal.

34:56.678 --> 34:58.137
- Nailed it.
- Yeah.

34:58.179 --> 34:59.824
- I don't know - how we do it.
- It's magic.

34:59.848 --> 35:01.225
There are times

35:01.226 --> 35:02.601
when I wake up

34:59.848 --> 35:02.601
and I wish I knew.

35:02.642 --> 35:04.370
- And then there - are times when
- I wish I didn't know.

35:04.394 --> 35:06.145
- And right now is
- one of those times.

35:06.187 --> 35:08.147
- Where I wish
- I didn't know

35:08.189 --> 35:10.029
- That I do know. - And you
- Still don't know.

35:11.234 --> 35:12.712
- I know what you
- guys are thinking.

35:12.736 --> 35:13.966
I'll take it from here.

35:13.967 --> 35:15.196
I know what you

35:12.736 --> 35:15.196
guys are thinking.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.032
- "I gotta get to
- New York City."

35:17.074 --> 35:18.116
Right, bicoastal.

35:18.117 --> 35:19.158
"Get me to the Big Apple."

35:19.200 --> 35:20.911
- Hightail it up there! No.
- No.

35:20.953 --> 35:22.513
- That is a bad idea. - You are gonna get cut.
- Horrible.

35:22.537 --> 35:24.181
- Each and every one of you.
- You're gonna get cut a lot.

35:24.205 --> 35:26.059
- We got cut. Went - to New York City.
- Yeah, we did.

35:26.083 --> 35:27.166
We got cut twice.

35:27.208 --> 35:28.167
Same guy.

35:28.209 --> 35:29.812
- And that, more than
- anything, tells you,

35:29.836 --> 35:31.630
Don't go see a matinee of

35:31.631 --> 35:33.423
Spider-Man the Musical

35:29.836 --> 35:33.423
on a Wednesday.

35:33.465 --> 35:34.776
- Not during the middle
- of the week, you don't.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.072
Why you gonna

35:36.073 --> 35:37.343
go up here?

35:34.800 --> 35:37.343
Hightail it down here.

35:37.385 --> 35:38.637
Amish country.

35:38.638 --> 35:39.888
Pennsylvania, Franklin

35:37.385 --> 35:39.888
and Marshall University,

35:39.930 --> 35:41.473
great school,

35:41.474 --> 35:43.016
go out there, you

35:39.930 --> 35:43.016
roll an Amish guy.

35:43.058 --> 35:44.080
That should be on all

35:44.081 --> 35:45.102
of your bucket lists.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.478
It's fun, right? Get a couple

35:46.479 --> 35:47.813
cocktails in you, get out

35:45.143 --> 35:47.813
there with some friends.

35:47.854 --> 35:49.206
They're not
- gonna fight back.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.000
- Maybe they'll
- throw a butter churn at you.

35:51.024 --> 35:52.150
Maybe.

35:55.236 --> 35:57.155
- Second place,
- city finals.

35:59.741 --> 36:02.301
- I mean, forget - nationals, we don't
- Even qualify for states.

36:02.995 --> 36:04.538
Should've seen the

36:04.539 --> 36:06.081
first place trophy, too.

36:02.995 --> 36:06.081
It was a silver cup.

36:06.123 --> 36:07.165
Just like, I could've

36:07.166 --> 36:08.207
drank my coffee out

36:06.123 --> 36:08.207
of it in the morning,

36:08.249 --> 36:10.209
- but now it's just me
- and the little guy, so...

36:12.253 --> 36:14.151
There will be no

36:14.152 --> 36:16.049
Super-Robot Bowl 5,

36:12.253 --> 36:16.049
that's for sure.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.434
The Scarlet Letter

36:25.435 --> 36:27.019
gives Hester the power

36:23.849 --> 36:27.019
to see the sin in others.

36:27.060 --> 36:28.144
So she knows that nearly

36:28.145 --> 36:29.228
everyone in the Boston area

36:29.270 --> 36:30.939
- believes that
- they're sinners.

36:30.981 --> 36:32.441
But when they learn

36:32.442 --> 36:33.900
of Hester's public

36:30.981 --> 36:33.900
sin of adultery,

36:33.942 --> 36:35.735
- they jump at the
- chance to punish her

36:35.777 --> 36:37.028
Because they want

36:37.029 --> 36:38.279
to prove their purity

36:35.777 --> 36:38.279
to everyone else.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.406
- Now, Hawthorne
- tells us that everyone sins.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.284
Going back to Adam

36:42.285 --> 36:44.119
and Eve failing God in

36:40.448 --> 36:44.119
the Garden of Eden.

36:44.161 --> 36:45.328
And we feel so guilty.

36:45.370 --> 36:46.809
"Oh, no, God is

36:46.810 --> 36:48.247
disappointed in me."

36:48.289 --> 36:50.375
We feel bad and it sucks.

36:50.416 --> 36:51.834
If we would just let

36:51.835 --> 36:53.252
each other's mistakes go,

36:53.294 --> 36:54.814
- we'd be so much
- happier, but we don't.

36:54.838 --> 36:56.047
No, we're constantly

36:56.048 --> 36:57.256
trying to make each

36:54.838 --> 36:57.256
other feel bad,

36:57.298 --> 36:58.487
hoping that it will

36:58.488 --> 36:59.676
make us feel better.

36:59.718 --> 37:00.990
And that is where

37:00.991 --> 37:02.261
evil comes from.

37:02.303 --> 37:03.722
Not from the devil,

37:03.723 --> 37:05.140
not from hell.

37:05.182 --> 37:07.455
Evil is simply

37:07.456 --> 37:09.728
a byproduct of human

37:05.182 --> 37:09.728
fear and weakness.

37:09.769 --> 37:10.830
All right,
- how 'bout Claudius?

37:10.854 --> 37:12.313
He dies like a bitch.

37:12.355 --> 37:13.940
All right.

37:13.982 --> 37:15.108
Uh...

37:15.109 --> 37:16.234
Yeah, that's a start.

37:16.275 --> 37:17.485
Do you have

37:17.486 --> 37:18.695
a citation from the

37:16.275 --> 37:18.695
play to back that up?

37:18.737 --> 37:19.947
Yeah, I wrote

37:19.948 --> 37:21.156
it down here.

37:21.198 --> 37:22.908
"O, yet defend me,

37:22.909 --> 37:24.617
friends, I am but hurt."

37:26.327 --> 37:27.725
It's good. Good,

37:27.726 --> 37:29.122
you got one for Ophelia?

37:29.164 --> 37:30.603
I use Act IV, where

37:30.604 --> 37:32.042
she goes crazy, just

37:29.164 --> 37:32.042
before she kills herself.

37:34.044 --> 37:35.087
Wrote it here.

37:36.922 --> 37:39.299
"Young men will do't, if"

37:39.300 --> 37:41.676
they come to't, by cock,

37:36.922 --> 37:41.676
"they are to blame."

37:43.136 --> 37:44.137
Um, why'd you

37:44.138 --> 37:45.138
choose that quote?

37:45.180 --> 37:46.973
- I don't know.
- She said "cock"?

37:47.015 --> 37:48.892
- Yeah, you went deep
- there, didn't you?

37:48.934 --> 37:49.998
Kind of

37:49.999 --> 37:51.061
sounds like rap.

37:51.103 --> 37:52.813
Young men will

37:52.814 --> 37:54.522
do it, if they come to it,

37:51.103 --> 37:54.522
by cock, they are to blame.

37:54.564 --> 37:55.690
It's better than that

37:55.691 --> 37:56.816
crap you pulled in

37:54.564 --> 37:56.816
my class on Monday.

37:56.858 --> 37:58.086
- Aw, Coach, why you
- gotta play me like that?

37:58.110 --> 37:59.402
Did you have any lunch?

37:59.444 --> 38:00.588
- Nah, I didn't
- have any lunch.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.239
Take half my sandwich.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.281
Thanks.

38:04.908 --> 38:05.951
Next up.

38:05.992 --> 38:07.302
Thanks for
- coming, Mitch.

38:07.326 --> 38:08.661
Uh, well, yeah, no, we

38:08.662 --> 38:09.996
gotta get right on this.

38:10.038 --> 38:11.289
Well, um, I'm

38:11.290 --> 38:12.540
all over it. I spoke

38:10.038 --> 38:12.540
to the mother.

38:12.582 --> 38:13.979
We're gonna meet

38:13.980 --> 38:15.376
with them and Mr. Campbell

38:12.582 --> 38:15.376
tomorrow afternoon.

38:15.418 --> 38:16.691
Good. Good. Okay,

38:16.692 --> 38:17.963
I'm glad we're dealing

38:15.418 --> 38:17.963
with it right away.

38:18.004 --> 38:19.505
Yeah, me too.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.358
- Oh, God, hopefully - we can keep this
- Out of the papers.

38:21.382 --> 38:22.634
Oh, God, if the media

38:22.635 --> 38:23.885
gets ahold of it, then

38:21.382 --> 38:23.885
Brian's career is over.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.095
Yeah. You're

38:25.096 --> 38:26.263
kidding, right?

38:27.305 --> 38:28.890
What?

38:28.932 --> 38:30.413
Mitch, Brian's finished.

38:30.414 --> 38:31.893
At this point I'm just trying

38:28.932 --> 38:31.893
to protect the school.

38:31.935 --> 38:33.352
- But he didn't
- do anything.

38:33.394 --> 38:34.854
- Well, he must've
- done something.

38:34.896 --> 38:36.064
Why? Because a girl

38:36.065 --> 38:37.232
who's failing his class

38:34.896 --> 38:37.232
says so?

38:37.274 --> 38:38.755
Look, Mitch,

38:38.756 --> 38:40.235
I'm not insensitive

38:37.274 --> 38:40.235
to Brian's situation.

38:40.277 --> 38:41.545
- It's just that the
- school cannot afford...

38:41.569 --> 38:43.362
He's got a family, Ron!

38:43.404 --> 38:45.073
Have you ever heard

38:45.074 --> 38:46.741
of one of these problems

38:43.404 --> 38:46.741
resolving itself peacefully?

38:46.783 --> 38:48.576
- The teacher always
- takes the fall.

38:48.618 --> 38:50.015
Right, because

38:50.016 --> 38:51.412
bureaucrats like you are

38:48.618 --> 38:51.412
pushing him off the cliff.

38:51.454 --> 38:52.768
I spoke to the girl.

38:52.769 --> 38:54.082
I spoke to her mother.

38:54.124 --> 38:55.688
Did you speak to Brian?

38:55.689 --> 38:57.252
I mean, five years he

38:54.124 --> 38:57.252
has bled for this place.

38:57.294 --> 38:59.129
- Don't be so
- melodramatic.

38:59.171 --> 39:00.443
Did you talk to Brian,

39:00.444 --> 39:01.714
or did you just fire him

38:59.171 --> 39:01.714
and send him on his way?

39:01.756 --> 39:02.942
- I don't have
- time for this.

39:02.966 --> 39:04.401
- I'd like an answer
- to my question.

39:04.425 --> 39:06.386
Mitch, be here

39:06.387 --> 39:08.346
tomorrow at 5:00 p.m.

39:04.425 --> 39:08.346
This meeting is over.

39:11.432 --> 39:13.163
Thing about Ron is,

39:13.164 --> 39:14.894
he has his own

39:11.432 --> 39:14.894
managerial style.

39:14.936 --> 39:16.146
There's worse. There's

39:16.147 --> 39:17.355
worse principals than Ron.

39:17.396 --> 39:18.749
- No, okay, guys,
- what are you doing?

39:18.773 --> 39:19.795
We shouldn't be talking

39:19.796 --> 39:20.817
about our boss on camera.

39:20.859 --> 39:21.901
He's an idiot.

39:21.943 --> 39:23.653
- Okay.
- I could've... That's...

39:23.695 --> 39:25.030
Ron Douche couldn't

39:25.031 --> 39:26.364
lead three people

39:23.695 --> 39:26.364
out of an elevator

39:26.405 --> 39:27.424
- with a map
- and a flashlight.

39:27.448 --> 39:28.700
Eric.

39:28.741 --> 39:30.702
- Come on, that's - a little harsh.
- Whatever.

39:30.743 --> 39:31.953
I don't care.

39:31.954 --> 39:33.163
I got tenure.

39:37.500 --> 39:38.668
It's not that I don't

39:38.669 --> 39:39.836
like Ron Douche.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.067
I don't like the way

39:41.068 --> 39:42.255
he does his job.

39:42.297 --> 39:43.778
I don't think he's

39:43.779 --> 39:45.258
here for the kids.

39:45.300 --> 39:46.843
Are you here for the kids?

39:46.844 --> 39:48.386
Or are you here for

39:45.300 --> 39:48.386
your next promotion?

39:51.014 --> 39:53.016
I don't really know

39:53.017 --> 39:55.018
her very well, I just...

39:51.014 --> 39:55.018
Just by reputation.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.332
What I do know is that

39:56.333 --> 39:57.603
Brian has such a good heart.

39:57.645 --> 39:59.231
- I just don't
- believe it's true.

39:59.272 --> 40:00.857
Yeah, Brian's in

40:00.858 --> 40:02.441
serious trouble.

39:59.272 --> 40:02.441
But he knows better.

40:02.483 --> 40:04.715
You never let

40:04.716 --> 40:06.946
yourself be alone in

40:02.483 --> 40:06.946
a room with a student,

40:06.988 --> 40:10.408
girl or boy, or even two.

40:12.244 --> 40:13.428
- They work in
- teams sometimes.

40:13.452 --> 40:14.722
- And they see me,
- I'm down in the gym,

40:14.746 --> 40:15.810
I'm on the treadmill,

40:15.811 --> 40:16.873
shorts, tank top,

40:16.915 --> 40:17.937
a lot of times I get

40:17.938 --> 40:18.958
sweaty at lunch.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.644
- You don't know what these
- kids are gonna think.

40:20.668 --> 40:22.003
And at that age,

40:22.004 --> 40:23.338
they can't resist.

40:24.381 --> 40:26.154
So, I need to be the one

40:26.155 --> 40:27.926
who steps up and says,

40:27.967 --> 40:29.198
"Not today,"

40:29.199 --> 40:30.428
mister, or missus.

40:31.470 --> 40:32.470
"Or both of you."

40:34.140 --> 40:35.808
Yeah, yeah, we know

40:35.809 --> 40:37.476
the Campbells very well.

40:37.518 --> 40:38.853
The guys met in college,

40:38.854 --> 40:40.188
and then

40:40.230 --> 40:43.482
Jackie and I are really close.

40:43.524 --> 40:45.172
I mean, she's

40:45.173 --> 40:46.819
one of my best friends.

40:49.488 --> 40:51.199
I don't know, I'm just...

40:51.241 --> 40:52.784
I'm dying inside for this

40:52.785 --> 40:54.327
woman, but I swear to God,

40:54.369 --> 40:55.412
I have no idea

40:55.413 --> 40:56.454
what to say to her.

41:02.752 --> 41:04.212
What's going on at that

41:04.213 --> 41:05.671
school, what's been

41:02.752 --> 41:05.671
going on at that school,

41:05.713 --> 41:07.173
is disgusting.

41:07.215 --> 41:08.675
And people need

41:08.676 --> 41:10.135
to hear about it.

41:10.176 --> 41:11.782
We've just been

41:11.783 --> 41:13.388
bystanders this entire time

41:13.430 --> 41:14.556
and I had no idea

41:14.557 --> 41:15.681
how that would

41:15.723 --> 41:17.183
end up hurting our family.

41:17.184 --> 41:18.643
And people need to know.

41:20.561 --> 41:22.146
If it wouldn't have

41:22.147 --> 41:23.731
been us, it would've

41:20.561 --> 41:23.731
been somebody else.

41:23.773 --> 41:25.149
I don't understand how

41:25.150 --> 41:26.525
someone so young

41:26.567 --> 41:29.112
could be so full of hate.

41:29.154 --> 41:30.780
So full of

41:30.822 --> 41:32.678
just vile and viscous anger

41:32.679 --> 41:34.533
to lash out like this.

41:34.575 --> 41:37.412
And I hate to say it,

41:37.454 --> 41:39.538
- but the person that I look to
- is the mother.

41:39.580 --> 41:40.936
And I don't understand how

41:40.937 --> 41:42.292
she could've let this happen.

41:42.334 --> 41:44.670
And you know,

41:44.671 --> 41:47.005
I'm about to become

41:42.334 --> 41:47.005
a mother and I...

41:47.046 --> 41:48.527
Uh, I hate to be

41:48.528 --> 41:50.008
so judgmental,

41:50.049 --> 41:51.801
but if in 18 years I've

41:51.802 --> 41:53.552
become like that woman,

41:53.594 --> 41:55.284
I don't know how I

41:55.285 --> 41:56.973
could live with myself.

41:58.599 --> 42:00.080
This is the crib from

42:00.081 --> 42:01.560
Kate and Mitch, you know.

42:01.602 --> 42:03.083
They gave it to us right

42:03.084 --> 42:04.563
after we told them that

42:01.602 --> 42:04.563
we were having Jackson.

42:04.605 --> 42:05.731
Yes.

42:05.773 --> 42:07.337
And then now, of course,

42:07.338 --> 42:08.901
they need it,

42:08.943 --> 42:11.070
- but they're letting us keep
- it 'cause they're...

42:11.112 --> 42:12.714
- They're just - wonderful, and...
- Yeah.

42:12.738 --> 42:14.136
And they've been there

42:14.137 --> 42:15.533
for us, through this, too.

42:15.574 --> 42:16.638
They were the first

42:16.639 --> 42:17.702
ones that we told, and...

42:18.953 --> 42:20.455
I met with a

42:20.456 --> 42:21.956
lawyer, which is

42:23.041 --> 42:27.253
bizarre, and I never expected

42:27.295 --> 42:30.069
to actually be in

42:30.070 --> 42:32.842
the situation of having

42:27.295 --> 42:32.842
to defend myself.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.532
And I waited

42:34.533 --> 42:36.179
for a phone call

42:36.221 --> 42:37.910
from, uh, my principal,

42:37.911 --> 42:39.598
Mr. Douche.

42:39.640 --> 42:43.978
And, uh, that didn't come.

42:44.020 --> 42:45.855
So I'm expecting to

42:45.856 --> 42:47.690
have to defend myself,

42:47.732 --> 42:50.776
tomorrow, and uh...

42:54.655 --> 42:57.534
And hopefully be able

42:57.535 --> 43:00.412
to take care of my family.

43:06.292 --> 43:07.811
To say that
- parent-teacher conferences

43:07.835 --> 43:09.879
- Tend to cause some anxiety
- amongst the faculty

43:09.921 --> 43:11.839
- Would be a gross
- understatement.

43:11.881 --> 43:13.195
We've got a diverse bunch

43:13.196 --> 43:14.509
of personalities

43:14.551 --> 43:16.278
- and we all deal with the night
- in our own way.

43:25.186 --> 43:27.147
Personally, I can't say

43:27.148 --> 43:29.107
I dislike them because

43:25.186 --> 43:29.107
sometimes they're great.

43:29.148 --> 43:30.334
- We know he's not
- studying enough.

43:30.358 --> 43:31.714
We took away

43:31.715 --> 43:33.069
his computers,

43:30.358 --> 43:33.069
telephone, his TV.

43:33.111 --> 43:34.862
- That's good,
- that's all good.

43:34.904 --> 43:36.549
It's an important part
- of our job,

43:36.573 --> 43:38.032
- And when a
- conference goes well,

43:38.074 --> 43:39.576
- It can really make
- a difference.

43:39.617 --> 43:40.910
Well, let's talk about

43:40.911 --> 43:42.203
some strategies you

43:39.617 --> 43:42.203
can employ, okay?

43:42.245 --> 43:43.538
If you would just

43:43.539 --> 43:44.830
turn the television

43:42.245 --> 43:44.830
off for five minutes

43:44.872 --> 43:46.332
- and let him do
- his homework...

43:46.374 --> 43:47.625
Oh, how's the view from

43:47.626 --> 43:48.876
the grandstand, Phil?

43:48.918 --> 43:50.795
I'm the one raising him

43:50.796 --> 43:52.671
while you're out vacationing

43:48.918 --> 43:52.671
with your whore.

43:52.713 --> 43:53.986
In reality, though,

43:53.987 --> 43:55.258
it's usually a long night.

43:55.300 --> 43:56.885
And normally, I like the

43:56.886 --> 43:58.470
kids to believe that there

43:55.300 --> 43:58.470
are no stupid questions,

43:58.511 --> 44:01.056
but sometimes I think

44:01.057 --> 44:03.600
Marcus asks questions

43:58.511 --> 44:03.600
just to disrupt my class.

44:03.849 --> 44:05.643
Really?

44:06.436 --> 44:07.875
Can you give

44:07.876 --> 44:09.314
me an example?

44:09.355 --> 44:10.857
Well, last week,

44:10.858 --> 44:12.358
in the middle of a quiz,

44:12.400 --> 44:13.568
he raised his hand to ask me

44:13.569 --> 44:14.735
if I had ever considered

44:14.777 --> 44:16.737
- how weird the
- Teletubbies are.

44:16.779 --> 44:18.072
I love that moment when

44:18.073 --> 44:19.365
I tell the mother what

44:16.779 --> 44:19.365
her kid's been up to

44:19.407 --> 44:20.658
and she makes that face.

44:22.910 --> 44:24.329
What?

44:24.370 --> 44:25.476
I call it the

44:25.477 --> 44:26.581
"I'm gonna smack his ass

44:26.623 --> 44:27.665
"with a hairbrush in the

44:27.666 --> 44:28.707
"parking lot" face.

44:28.749 --> 44:29.834
The "I'm gonna smack"

44:29.835 --> 44:30.918
his ass with a hairbrush

44:28.749 --> 44:30.918
"in the parking lot" face

44:30.960 --> 44:32.336
may not be my favorite thing

44:32.337 --> 44:33.712
about teaching,

44:33.754 --> 44:35.235
but it's definitely

44:35.236 --> 44:36.715
in the top five.

44:38.177 --> 44:39.594
Ooh, angry parents.

44:39.636 --> 44:41.053
- Rough night,
- rough night.

44:41.095 --> 44:42.823
- I don't like getting - yelled at, I'll
- Tell you that much.

44:42.847 --> 44:44.223
- What is wrong
- with them. Whew.

44:44.265 --> 44:45.784
- Well, honestly, what
- do you guys expect,

44:45.808 --> 44:47.185
You might be the

44:47.186 --> 44:48.561
worst guidance

44:45.808 --> 44:48.561
counselors of all time.

44:48.603 --> 44:49.955
- I take that - as a compliment.
- I like that.

44:49.979 --> 44:51.730
I'll tell you why, because

44:51.772 --> 44:52.940
what would be worse

44:52.941 --> 44:54.108
is if you said nothing.

44:54.150 --> 44:55.631
We provoked a reaction.

44:55.632 --> 44:57.111
Yeah, it's what we do.

44:57.153 --> 44:59.071
- You told students
- in my class

44:59.113 --> 45:00.633
- That they probably
- wouldn't survive the day.

45:00.657 --> 45:02.450
- Some of them
- won't or didn't.

45:02.492 --> 45:03.892
I don't know
- about that.

45:04.452 --> 45:05.953
Got a rise out of you.

45:05.995 --> 45:07.746
Mrs. Rose, simply put,

45:07.788 --> 45:09.248
your son is too stupid to

45:09.249 --> 45:10.707
be on the robotics team.

45:10.749 --> 45:11.750
How dare you say anything

45:11.751 --> 45:12.751
like that about my son!

45:12.793 --> 45:14.062
- No, it's not me,
- it's nothing personal.

45:14.086 --> 45:15.275
I'm just wondering, uh,

45:15.276 --> 45:16.464
did you drop him as a child?

45:16.506 --> 45:17.695
Was he deprived oxygen

45:17.696 --> 45:18.883
for over three minutes?

45:18.924 --> 45:20.134
How dare you say

45:20.135 --> 45:21.344
anything like that

45:18.924 --> 45:21.344
about my son!

45:21.386 --> 45:23.113
- All I'm saying is, if he
- doesn't get his act together,

45:23.137 --> 45:24.951
Then I'm gonna design

45:24.952 --> 45:26.765
a robot specifically

45:23.137 --> 45:26.765
to choke him out.

45:26.807 --> 45:28.121
Um, Eric and I do

45:28.122 --> 45:29.435
a cover band.

45:29.477 --> 45:31.497
- This is one of the things... - Talk about
- Teacher of the Year,

45:31.521 --> 45:33.207
- And I think a lot of times,
- guys who go out

45:33.231 --> 45:35.233
And do all kinds of

45:35.234 --> 45:37.235
extracurricular activity,

45:33.231 --> 45:37.235
um...

45:37.276 --> 45:39.070
- They have to
- make it happen.

45:39.111 --> 45:40.196
Yeah, and you know,

45:40.197 --> 45:41.280
we show the kids...

45:39.111 --> 45:41.280
Not just in the classroom.

45:41.322 --> 45:42.552
Right, we show the

45:42.553 --> 45:43.782
kids that there's a

45:41.322 --> 45:43.782
world outside of school.

45:43.824 --> 45:44.909
Mmm-hmm.

45:44.910 --> 45:45.993
And so we have

45:43.824 --> 45:45.993
a cover band.

45:46.035 --> 45:47.245
It is of a band

45:47.246 --> 45:48.454
I was a big, uh, fan of,

45:48.496 --> 45:49.560
it's called

45:49.561 --> 45:50.623
the Indigo Girls.

45:48.496 --> 45:50.623
Hmm.

45:50.665 --> 45:52.059
- Yes, it's one of your
- favorites, isn't it?

45:52.083 --> 45:53.251
It is true,

45:53.252 --> 45:54.419
and so it's a duet.

45:54.460 --> 45:55.794
Uh, duo.

45:55.836 --> 45:58.047
And so, one problem is...

45:58.089 --> 45:59.570
I don't... I don't

45:59.571 --> 46:01.050
play the guitar.

45:58.089 --> 46:01.050
Not a note.

46:01.092 --> 46:02.801
- And, uh...
- And I don't sing.

46:02.843 --> 46:04.324
No. But the... Unfortunately

46:04.325 --> 46:05.804
it was a duo, so I

46:02.843 --> 46:05.804
needed someone else

46:05.846 --> 46:07.056
- and you had
- weekends free,

46:07.098 --> 46:09.034
- And so we'll do a gig down
- at like Ruby Tuesday's.

46:09.058 --> 46:10.247
You have no control

46:10.248 --> 46:11.436
over these kids.

46:09.058 --> 46:11.436
I see.

46:11.477 --> 46:12.829
- You haven't taught
- my son one thing.

46:12.853 --> 46:14.105
He has not learned one

46:14.106 --> 46:15.356
thing in your class!

46:15.398 --> 46:16.875
- Mrs. White, may I
- ask you a question?

46:16.899 --> 46:18.252
- Oh, you have a
- question for me?

46:18.276 --> 46:19.527
Yes, if you don't mind...

46:19.528 --> 46:20.777
Oh, really, what...

46:18.276 --> 46:20.777
What is it?

46:20.819 --> 46:22.530
- Why did you come
- here tonight?

46:22.572 --> 46:24.031
Excuse me?

46:24.073 --> 46:25.304
If you came here to find

46:25.305 --> 46:26.534
out how your son can do

46:26.576 --> 46:27.702
better in my class

46:27.703 --> 46:28.827
and get a higher grade,

46:28.869 --> 46:31.163
we can keep on talking.

46:31.205 --> 46:32.436
But if you've come

46:32.437 --> 46:33.666
here to yell at me,

46:33.708 --> 46:35.167
- then this
- conference is over.

46:36.483 --> 46:37.754
Boom, baby!

46:37.794 --> 46:38.837
I love it.

46:38.879 --> 46:40.381
- Don't you wish...
- Nice.

46:40.423 --> 46:42.023
- All I wanted to say.
- Oh, I love that.

46:42.049 --> 46:43.402
Thank goodness
- somebody said it.

46:43.426 --> 46:46.137
I swear to God,

46:46.178 --> 46:47.638
I would give back

46:47.639 --> 46:49.098
half my salary

46:46.178 --> 46:49.098
if they would let me

46:49.140 --> 46:50.287
punch a parent once a year.

46:50.288 --> 46:51.434
Yes!

46:51.476 --> 46:52.727
Just once!

46:53.894 --> 46:55.647
- So, we play
- Closer to Fine,

46:55.688 --> 46:57.291
- And we'll do it at
- local establishments.

46:57.315 --> 46:59.087
And, uh, it's

46:59.088 --> 47:00.859
the only song I know.

47:00.901 --> 47:02.695
- And I don't
- know it at all.

47:02.737 --> 47:04.301
No, uh, that's a problem,

47:04.302 --> 47:05.864
'cause he doesn't, uh...

47:05.906 --> 47:07.908
But I look good, so...

47:07.950 --> 47:09.428
- And it's a duo, so we
- have to do it together...

47:09.452 --> 47:10.869
I add color.

47:13.914 --> 47:15.874
- You add maybe too
- much color sometimes.

47:15.916 --> 47:17.894
- Anyway... - In some of the
- Places we play it,

47:17.918 --> 47:19.062
- You know, it's...
- No, it...

47:19.086 --> 47:20.963
- It's not a colorful bar.
- Sometimes...

47:28.845 --> 47:30.327
So, Alex has been

47:30.328 --> 47:31.808
improving lately,

47:31.848 --> 47:32.870
but he does

47:32.871 --> 47:33.892
very little homework.

47:47.657 --> 47:48.658
She says she doesn't

47:48.659 --> 47:49.659
know what to do because

47:49.701 --> 47:50.702
I lie and tell her

47:50.703 --> 47:51.703
that I did my homework,

47:51.744 --> 47:54.184
- but she can't check because
- she doesn't speak any English.

47:56.833 --> 47:57.874
Si.

47:58.751 --> 48:00.211
Si.

48:05.216 --> 48:07.719
Hey there.

48:07.760 --> 48:09.345
People will say

48:09.346 --> 48:10.929
we're in love.

48:10.971 --> 48:12.931
- Parent-teacher
- conference, huh?

48:12.973 --> 48:14.726
I don't miss those.

48:14.767 --> 48:16.686
- I didn't know - you taught.
- Oh, three years.

48:16.728 --> 48:18.937
Wasn't for me.

48:18.979 --> 48:20.960
Look, John, um,

48:20.961 --> 48:22.941
I'm interested,

48:18.979 --> 48:22.941
uh, I really am,

48:22.983 --> 48:24.464
but I just...

48:24.465 --> 48:25.944
I'm gonna need

48:22.983 --> 48:25.944
a couple of days.

48:25.986 --> 48:27.946
- Well, my advice was
- to leave you alone,

48:27.988 --> 48:28.989
Let you make up

48:28.990 --> 48:29.990
your own mind,

48:30.032 --> 48:31.576
but I got overruled.

48:32.744 --> 48:34.620
In favor of what?

48:34.662 --> 48:36.518
They told me to come

48:36.519 --> 48:38.374
right over here and

48:34.662 --> 48:38.374
raise the offer to 150.

48:42.002 --> 48:43.796
$150,000?

48:43.797 --> 48:45.590
To start.

48:52.764 --> 48:54.119
You're their

48:54.120 --> 48:55.474
number one draft pick, Mitch.

48:55.516 --> 48:57.142
- Look, you call me
- tomorrow.

48:57.184 --> 48:58.935
- Let me know what
- you wanna do.

49:07.403 --> 49:09.283
Can I ask
- what you're thinking?

49:10.364 --> 49:12.471
Uh, I'm thinking it's

49:12.472 --> 49:14.577
an amazing opportunity.

49:16.662 --> 49:17.830
I'm thinking it

49:17.831 --> 49:18.997
could change my life.

49:19.039 --> 49:20.583
So what's the problem?

49:22.418 --> 49:23.690
I'm trying to decide

49:23.691 --> 49:24.961
whether or not my

49:22.418 --> 49:24.961
life needs changing.

50:12.092 --> 50:13.490
he's a surgeon, they're

50:13.491 --> 50:14.887
about to force him out of

50:12.092 --> 50:14.887
the operating room.

50:14.929 --> 50:16.072
- What the hell's
- he gonna do?

50:16.096 --> 50:17.202
He's gonna live another

50:17.203 --> 50:18.307
40 years with today's

50:16.096 --> 50:18.307
technology...

50:18.349 --> 50:19.992
- They will not let that...
- He's gonna go crazy.

50:20.016 --> 50:21.226
He should be here,

50:21.227 --> 50:22.436
teaching AP biology,

50:22.478 --> 50:24.209
coaching the golf team

50:24.210 --> 50:25.940
and making a contribution,

50:22.478 --> 50:25.940
like he wants to.

50:27.358 --> 50:28.836
- Here's what's gonna
- happen with that idea.

50:28.860 --> 50:29.965
Once you leave this

50:29.966 --> 50:31.069
building with an idea,

50:31.111 --> 50:32.592
it's gonna go to the

50:32.593 --> 50:34.072
bureaucracy, and once

50:31.111 --> 50:34.072
they get ahold of it,

50:34.114 --> 50:35.073
- they're gonna
- shut it down.

50:35.115 --> 50:36.137
Not when they

50:36.138 --> 50:37.159
realize it's feasible!

50:38.828 --> 50:40.263
So, it's impossible
- to change.

50:40.287 --> 50:42.098
- It's impossible to change.
- No, you need to start,

50:42.122 --> 50:43.475
- You need to
- change from within.

50:43.499 --> 50:44.813
Thank you.

50:44.814 --> 50:46.126
You need to... Hey, who's

50:43.499 --> 50:46.126
the union rep? That's you.

50:46.168 --> 50:47.399
Yeah.

50:47.400 --> 50:48.629
So, we need to go

50:46.168 --> 50:48.629
in through you

50:48.671 --> 50:49.857
- to get them to
- change the rules.

50:49.881 --> 50:51.089
Exactly why I...

50:51.131 --> 50:52.278
No, I wouldn't say

50:52.279 --> 50:53.425
I'm worried about Mitch.

50:53.467 --> 50:54.844
I just wish he'd find more

50:54.845 --> 50:56.220
ways to have fun with his job.

50:56.261 --> 50:57.596
That's what I do.

50:57.638 --> 50:59.348
And how does the man begin

50:59.349 --> 51:01.057
the act of intercourse?

51:01.893 --> 51:04.102
Anybody? Lamont?

51:04.144 --> 51:05.855
- He puts his penis
- in her thing?

51:07.003 --> 51:08.106
In her thing.

51:08.148 --> 51:09.233
No, no.

51:09.274 --> 51:11.151
It's called a vagina.

51:12.152 --> 51:14.154
It's a lovely word.

51:14.196 --> 51:16.490
Vagina. Vagina.

51:17.805 --> 51:19.075
It's lovely.

51:19.117 --> 51:20.640
How many jobs do you

51:20.641 --> 51:22.162
know that you get paid to

51:22.204 --> 51:23.268
make teenagers

51:23.269 --> 51:24.331
feel nauseous?

51:29.003 --> 51:30.671
Kian, homework.

51:30.713 --> 51:31.901
Oh, I... I couldn't

51:31.902 --> 51:33.089
do it, Mr. Carter.

51:30.713 --> 51:33.089
It was raining.

51:35.175 --> 51:37.093
- What does that
- even mean?

51:38.220 --> 51:39.326
Okay, guys, we have our

51:39.327 --> 51:40.431
test on Wednesday,

51:40.472 --> 51:41.974
so that means I need

51:41.975 --> 51:43.475
all your journal work.

51:43.517 --> 51:45.019
Can I have some

51:45.020 --> 51:46.520
quiet, please?

51:46.562 --> 51:48.146
Everybody, get quiet.

51:49.189 --> 51:50.691
Quiet, please!

51:53.360 --> 51:54.883
Marcus, if you don't

51:54.884 --> 51:56.405
shut up, I'm gonna throw

51:53.360 --> 51:56.405
you out that window.

51:58.156 --> 51:59.157
Whatever, it's

51:59.158 --> 52:00.158
only two stories.

52:03.203 --> 52:04.580
You guys are killing me.

52:04.581 --> 52:05.957
You're killing me!

52:08.292 --> 52:09.585
When his face

52:09.586 --> 52:10.878
turns all red like that,

52:10.920 --> 52:12.150
he

52:12.151 --> 52:13.380
just cracks me up.

52:14.924 --> 52:16.342
On Thursdays,

52:16.343 --> 52:17.760
I have lunch duty

52:14.924 --> 52:17.760
in the courtyard.

52:17.802 --> 52:19.345
Uh, kids like to

52:19.346 --> 52:20.888
tell me what's going

52:17.802 --> 52:20.888
on in their lives.

52:20.930 --> 52:22.035
Really wish they'd

52:22.036 --> 52:23.139
stop doing that.

52:23.181 --> 52:24.725
I cheated on my

52:24.726 --> 52:26.268
chemistry test.

52:23.181 --> 52:26.268
He didn't even see!

52:26.310 --> 52:27.937
Jenna and all her

52:27.938 --> 52:29.563
skanky friends still

52:26.310 --> 52:29.563
talk crap about me.

52:29.605 --> 52:31.189
I just think it's funny.

52:31.231 --> 52:33.191
- Can't get this
- itch on my left nut.

52:33.233 --> 52:34.568
Ah, thanks for the

52:34.569 --> 52:35.903
update, Novak,

52:33.233 --> 52:35.903
I appreciate that.

52:39.490 --> 52:40.845
Audrey, do you

52:40.846 --> 52:42.200
need something?

52:42.242 --> 52:44.453
I'm his girlfriend.

52:44.495 --> 52:46.956
You're his girlfriend?

52:46.998 --> 52:48.164
How is that possible?

52:58.216 --> 52:59.364
Wow,

52:59.365 --> 53:00.511
your students

52:58.216 --> 53:00.511
are so into your class.

53:00.552 --> 53:01.595
Well, don't sound

53:01.596 --> 53:02.638
so surprised.

53:02.680 --> 53:04.995
No, no. It's just... It's

53:04.996 --> 53:07.309
not... It's just, I've seen

53:02.680 --> 53:07.309
the school's test scores.

53:07.351 --> 53:09.231
- And the history department's
- are the lowest.

53:09.269 --> 53:10.646
By quite a bit,

53:10.647 --> 53:12.023
unfortunately.

53:12.064 --> 53:13.315
Why do you

53:13.316 --> 53:14.566
think that is?

53:14.608 --> 53:17.945
Our department lacks

53:17.987 --> 53:19.613
depth.

53:19.655 --> 53:21.240
So you can see here,

53:21.241 --> 53:22.825
very clearly, where the

53:19.655 --> 53:22.825
country was divided

53:22.867 --> 53:24.055
during the Civil War.

53:24.056 --> 53:25.243
Uh, fun fact,

53:25.285 --> 53:26.996
Kentucky was sort

53:26.997 --> 53:28.706
of the Switzerland of,

53:25.285 --> 53:28.706
uh, the Civil War

53:28.747 --> 53:30.708
- because they
- were neutral.

53:30.749 --> 53:32.501
Uh, another fun fact,

53:32.502 --> 53:34.252
uh, North Carolina is

53:30.749 --> 53:34.252
where my parents live,

53:34.294 --> 53:35.754
so... And, um,

53:35.755 --> 53:37.213
the Mason-Dixon Line is

53:37.255 --> 53:38.611
what actually divided

53:38.612 --> 53:39.967
the North and the...

53:40.009 --> 53:41.135
Guys, can you just please

53:41.136 --> 53:42.260
listen to me?

53:42.302 --> 53:43.971
I'm really... Look, no...

53:44.013 --> 53:45.056
No one cares about

53:45.057 --> 53:46.098
this stuff, all right?

53:46.140 --> 53:47.704
I'm not gonna pretend

53:47.705 --> 53:49.267
that they do. You'll never

53:46.140 --> 53:49.267
need to know this again.

53:49.309 --> 53:50.707
But for today, I need you

53:50.708 --> 53:52.104
to know this, all right?

53:52.146 --> 53:53.585
I just... Can you just take

53:53.586 --> 53:55.024
one standardized test

53:52.146 --> 53:55.024
that says

53:55.066 --> 53:56.986
- you've learned anything
- that I've taught you.

53:57.026 --> 53:58.652
Just even like a 25%

53:58.653 --> 54:00.278
would be enough for me

54:00.320 --> 54:01.676
to keep my job and my

54:01.677 --> 54:03.032
crappy little apartment

54:03.074 --> 54:04.179
and I can drive

54:04.180 --> 54:05.283
my used Honda Civic

54:05.325 --> 54:06.347
back to the house that

54:06.348 --> 54:07.369
I cry myself to sleep in.

54:07.411 --> 54:08.788
You know what, fine,

54:08.789 --> 54:10.164
I will go to the

54:07.411 --> 54:10.164
principal's office.

54:11.833 --> 54:13.458
I will... Does that not

54:10.206 --> 54:13.458
mean anything to you?

54:15.335 --> 54:16.482
What do I say

54:16.483 --> 54:17.629
to this kid?

54:17.671 --> 54:19.297
- What do I say
- to her mother?

54:19.339 --> 54:20.695
Try to pin them down

54:20.696 --> 54:22.051
on something factual.

54:23.594 --> 54:25.450
The only way this is all

54:25.451 --> 54:27.305
gonna turn out well is if

54:23.594 --> 54:27.305
you get the facts out.

54:29.349 --> 54:30.643
And choose your

54:30.644 --> 54:31.936
words carefully.

54:31.977 --> 54:33.687
As soon as you make

54:33.688 --> 54:35.397
a judgment on the

54:31.977 --> 54:35.397
girl or her mother,

54:35.439 --> 54:37.357
- you're gonna be in a war
- you can never win.

54:37.399 --> 54:38.818
But I'm not just gonna

54:38.819 --> 54:40.236
sit there and let Brian

54:37.399 --> 54:40.236
get buried for something...

54:40.276 --> 54:41.778
I'm not telling you to.

54:41.779 --> 54:43.279
Just remember that the parent

54:43.321 --> 54:44.531
sees their child as an

54:44.532 --> 54:45.741
extension of themselves.

54:45.783 --> 54:47.576
- There's nothing more
- personal to them.

54:47.618 --> 54:50.454
Right, right.

54:50.495 --> 54:52.143
Oh, Brian Campbell, that

54:52.144 --> 54:53.791
guy's going down hard.

54:53.832 --> 54:55.126
It's gonna be ugly.

54:55.167 --> 54:56.335
So glad I don't have

54:56.336 --> 54:57.502
to go to that meeting.

54:57.544 --> 54:58.817
I have a colonoscopy

54:58.818 --> 55:00.089
this afternoon,

55:00.131 --> 55:01.174
not really looking

55:01.175 --> 55:02.216
forward to that either.

55:02.258 --> 55:04.260
It goes to show you

55:04.261 --> 55:06.262
how much I do not want to go

55:02.258 --> 55:06.262
to this meeting.

55:07.345 --> 55:08.555
- As he...
- He didn't do it!

55:08.597 --> 55:09.991
- He's a predator.
- He is not a predator.

55:10.015 --> 55:11.079
You ever been to

55:11.080 --> 55:12.143
the teachers' lounge?

55:10.015 --> 55:12.143
Yeah.

55:12.184 --> 55:13.540
And you reach

55:13.541 --> 55:14.895
for the French vanilla

55:12.184 --> 55:14.895
coffee creamer?

55:14.937 --> 55:16.188
One time, he took it

55:16.189 --> 55:17.439
from you as you guys were

55:17.481 --> 55:19.417
- both reaching at - the same time.
- And used it up.

55:19.441 --> 55:21.002
- That's not predatory.
- And used it up.

55:21.026 --> 55:22.360
That is not predatory.

55:22.402 --> 55:24.029
I... I was fearing for

55:24.030 --> 55:25.656
my sexual well-being.

55:22.402 --> 55:25.656
Oh, come on.

55:26.406 --> 55:27.658
I'm praying for him.

55:29.409 --> 55:30.953
- Last night, I
- prayed for him.

55:32.163 --> 55:34.414
Jackie.

55:34.456 --> 55:35.603
She's being as

55:35.604 --> 55:36.750
supportive as she can be.

55:36.792 --> 55:38.418
'Cause I didn't do it.

55:38.460 --> 55:40.462
Yeah, of course.

55:40.504 --> 55:41.589
Still killing

55:41.590 --> 55:42.673
her on the inside.

55:45.425 --> 55:46.698
And when they fire me...

55:46.699 --> 55:47.970
Come on, man, you

55:45.425 --> 55:47.970
don't know that.

55:48.012 --> 55:50.181
Ron has to fire me.

55:50.222 --> 55:51.389
It's what I would do.

55:51.431 --> 55:53.100
Just try and keep it

55:53.101 --> 55:54.768
together, please, all right?

55:56.187 --> 55:58.063
My career.

55:58.105 --> 56:00.065
- It's over.
- Hey!

56:00.107 --> 56:01.441
- What am I gonna
- do for a job?

56:01.483 --> 56:02.651
Will you stop whining

56:02.652 --> 56:03.819
about the future

56:03.861 --> 56:06.947
and focus on right now, okay?

56:06.989 --> 56:08.177
Protect your family,

56:08.178 --> 56:09.365
protect yourself.

56:10.117 --> 56:11.367
It's not done.

56:13.162 --> 56:14.370
Ah.

56:20.544 --> 56:22.420
Ah.

56:24.798 --> 56:26.717
I'm just gonna...

56:26.718 --> 56:28.635
Can I...

56:29.928 --> 56:31.639
Yeah, go, go,

56:31.640 --> 56:33.349
we got time.

56:36.643 --> 56:38.562
I'm just gonna...

56:40.480 --> 56:43.441
Go, go.

56:46.486 --> 56:48.030
I'll be right back.

56:56.621 --> 56:58.290
Shit.

57:08.466 --> 57:10.385
I was doing a problem

57:10.386 --> 57:12.304
on the board

57:12.346 --> 57:14.202
and he came up behind me

57:14.203 --> 57:16.058
and he started

57:16.100 --> 57:17.664
massaging my shoulders

57:17.665 --> 57:19.228
and then he slid

57:19.270 --> 57:20.563
his hands down the front

57:20.564 --> 57:21.855
of me and started

57:19.270 --> 57:21.855
rubbing my breasts.

57:21.897 --> 57:23.499
- It's okay, Faith, you don't
- have to go into details.

57:23.523 --> 57:25.501
- She will have to - discuss them with
- The police, however.

57:25.525 --> 57:26.965
Well, it was my

57:26.966 --> 57:28.404
understanding, from our

57:25.525 --> 57:28.404
phone conversations,

57:28.445 --> 57:29.467
Mrs. Gregory, that you

57:29.468 --> 57:30.488
wanted to keep the

57:28.445 --> 57:30.488
police out of this.

57:30.530 --> 57:31.591
- I swear, I didn't
- do anything.

57:31.615 --> 57:32.699
Yes, you did.

57:32.741 --> 57:33.742
For God's sake,

57:33.743 --> 57:34.743
Faith, please...

57:34.785 --> 57:35.890
Mr. Campbell, please

57:35.891 --> 57:36.995
control yourself.

57:34.785 --> 57:36.995
You're disgusting.

57:37.037 --> 57:38.663
Please, I'm begging...

57:38.705 --> 57:40.225
- If he says - one more word to her,
- We're leaving.

57:40.249 --> 57:41.396
So, it's Brian, Mitch,

57:41.397 --> 57:42.542
the girl and her mother.

57:42.584 --> 57:44.128
No lawyers?

57:44.169 --> 57:45.400
Apparently, Ron is

57:45.401 --> 57:46.630
working as hard as he can

57:46.671 --> 57:48.108
- to keep the whole
- thing off the record.

57:48.132 --> 57:50.217
- Well, why am I not
- surprised by that?

57:51.551 --> 57:53.529
- I don't know, but if - I was going in to
- A meeting like that,

57:53.553 --> 57:55.513
- I wouldn't want
- Mitch representing me.

57:55.555 --> 57:56.619
Really? Who else

57:56.620 --> 57:57.682
would you pick?

57:57.724 --> 57:58.997
I don't know, but...

57:58.998 --> 58:00.269
I don't know, Mitch

57:57.724 --> 58:00.269
would be my first choice.

58:00.311 --> 58:01.416
He's a really good

58:01.417 --> 58:02.520
man to have your back.

58:00.311 --> 58:02.520
Yeah.

58:02.562 --> 58:04.291
- That's the problem.
- He's too good. He's too nice.

58:04.315 --> 58:05.379
Wrong.

58:05.380 --> 58:06.442
Okay.

58:06.524 --> 58:07.525
Mitch is good.

58:07.526 --> 58:08.526
He's not nice.

58:08.568 --> 58:09.945
What's the difference?

58:09.987 --> 58:11.030
He's a good man, but

58:11.031 --> 58:12.072
you get on his bad side,

58:12.114 --> 58:13.240
teacher, student,

58:13.241 --> 58:14.366
anybody, good luck.

58:14.408 --> 58:15.635
- Faith...
- I did nothing wrong.

58:15.659 --> 58:17.577
- You're going to
- jail, you bastard!

58:17.619 --> 58:19.079
Okay, all right, let

58:19.080 --> 58:20.538
me just interject here

58:17.619 --> 58:20.538
for a second, okay?

58:20.580 --> 58:22.082
Um, Faith, I understand

58:22.083 --> 58:23.583
that you're upset, and, uh,

58:23.625 --> 58:25.210
none of us are suggesting...

58:25.211 --> 58:26.795
You think you can just

58:23.625 --> 58:26.795
grab any girl you want

58:26.837 --> 58:27.963
because you're

58:27.964 --> 58:29.089
the big boss?

58:26.837 --> 58:29.089
I did nothing wrong.

58:29.131 --> 58:30.882
- You call grabbing
- my boobs nothing?

58:30.924 --> 58:32.634
No, no,
- that is awful, Faith.

58:32.676 --> 58:34.528
- And he
- Doesn't anymore.

58:34.552 --> 58:35.929
Hold on, hold on,

58:35.930 --> 58:37.306
Faith,

58:37.348 --> 58:38.641
right now you

58:38.642 --> 58:39.933
just went like this

58:39.975 --> 58:41.744
- when you talked about what
- Mr. Campbell did to you.

58:41.768 --> 58:43.124
But earlier, you said

58:43.125 --> 58:44.480
that he was behind you.

58:46.106 --> 58:47.608
Oh, right, that's...

58:47.609 --> 58:49.109
That's what I meant.

58:49.151 --> 58:50.628
- What difference does - it make where they
- Were standing?

58:50.652 --> 58:52.779
- I don't think we have
- to rehash all the details...

58:52.821 --> 58:55.032
Just a second, Ron.

58:55.073 --> 58:56.533
Faith, I understand

58:56.534 --> 58:57.993
that you don't like

58:55.073 --> 58:57.993
Mr. Campbell's class.

58:58.035 --> 58:59.870
- And clearly you
- don't like Mr. Campbell.

58:59.911 --> 59:01.455
- I hate him.
- And that's okay.

59:01.497 --> 59:02.598
- That's enough,
- Mr. Carter.

59:02.622 --> 59:04.103
You're about to

59:04.104 --> 59:05.583
ruin a man's life.

59:05.625 --> 59:06.919
And his career.

59:06.920 --> 59:08.212
Maybe send him to jail.

59:08.253 --> 59:09.484
So what we need

59:09.485 --> 59:10.714
from you, right now,

59:10.755 --> 59:12.341
is to tell the truth.

59:12.383 --> 59:13.633
How dare you!

59:13.675 --> 59:15.114
My daughter is not on trial.

59:15.115 --> 59:16.553
Did Mr. Campbell

59:13.675 --> 59:16.553
touch you?

59:18.514 --> 59:19.890
He was looking at

59:19.891 --> 59:21.266
me like he wanted to.

59:23.977 --> 59:26.230
But he didn't, did he?

59:29.983 --> 59:31.130
No.

59:31.131 --> 59:32.277
Faith!

59:32.319 --> 59:33.737
Thank God.

59:33.778 --> 59:35.051
You shouldn't have

59:35.052 --> 59:36.323
failed me, you asshole!

59:36.365 --> 59:38.033
What is going on here?

59:38.075 --> 59:39.660
I assure you that

59:39.661 --> 59:41.245
we'll do whatever it takes

59:38.075 --> 59:41.245
to resolve this issue.

59:44.332 --> 59:45.999
That was pretty rough.

59:42.662 --> 59:45.999
How're you feeling?

59:48.668 --> 59:50.170
Like I've been doing this

59:50.171 --> 59:51.671
job for a hundred years,

59:54.132 --> 59:55.133
with a hundred

59:55.134 --> 59:56.134
more to go.

59:58.678 --> 01:00:01.639
John, hey, it's Mitch.

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:03.517
Hi, how you doing?

01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:06.228
Yeah, um...

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:08.605
I'll take it. I'll do it.

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:11.024
Yeah.

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:12.668
- Listen, let me talk - to you about the
- Details later, okay?

01:00:12.692 --> 01:00:16.447
I just... Okay, great.

01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:18.615
Great. Thank you. Bye.

01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:37.092
- Daddy!
- Hey, hi.

01:00:37.926 --> 01:00:39.657
Hello.

01:00:39.658 --> 01:00:41.388
So, what happened?

01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:42.556
You're not going

01:00:42.557 --> 01:00:43.681
to believe it.

01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:45.058
She made it up.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.018
What? How do you know?

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.686
She admitted it.

01:00:48.728 --> 01:00:50.522
Oh, my God.

01:00:50.564 --> 01:00:51.815
- I know, right.
- Oh, my God.

01:00:51.856 --> 01:00:53.900
Yay, family hug!

01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:56.194
Oh.

01:00:58.738 --> 01:01:00.740
It's over.

01:01:00.782 --> 01:01:02.659
How did it happen?

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.077
- I squeezed
- it out of her.

01:01:04.119 --> 01:01:05.870
You squeezed it out of her.

01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:07.056
- What, are you on - Law & Order or something?
- I could be.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.081
I'm gonna

01:01:08.082 --> 01:01:09.082
go call Jackie.

01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:10.500
Um, hang on,

01:01:10.501 --> 01:01:11.876
hang on. I, um...

01:01:13.545 --> 01:01:15.964
I, um...

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:17.382
I took the job.

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:20.073
You did?

01:01:20.074 --> 01:01:21.136
Yeah.

01:01:22.638 --> 01:01:25.974
Well, it's good.

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:27.268
It's good,

01:01:27.269 --> 01:01:28.519
it's gonna be good.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.624
I know.

01:01:29.625 --> 01:01:30.687
It'll be all right.

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:32.481
Yeah.

01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:43.867
I'm making my

01:01:43.868 --> 01:01:45.118
peace with it.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.911
- The money is
- unbelievable.

01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:48.017
And when the baby comes,

01:01:48.018 --> 01:01:49.080
Kate will be able to

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:50.624
take as much time off

01:01:50.625 --> 01:01:52.125
work as she needs.

01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:53.439
Maybe she won't

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.711
have to work at all.

01:01:58.298 --> 01:01:59.841
It was the right decision.

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:01.301
You wanna put him

01:02:01.302 --> 01:02:02.719
in the car? Let him go to the

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:02.719
movies or something?

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:13.956
- Just coffee
- for breakfast?

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.691
- Yeah, I gotta get
- to school early.

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.585
- Well, let me at least
- finish making your lunch here.

01:02:17.609 --> 01:02:19.444
No time, gotta go.

01:02:21.196 --> 01:02:22.780
What's the rush?

01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:24.199
Well, I have to

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.576
finish grading all my

01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:25.576
papers this morning,

01:02:25.617 --> 01:02:26.701
so that I can have

01:02:26.702 --> 01:02:27.785
a meeting with

01:02:25.617 --> 01:02:27.785
Ron this afternoon.

01:02:27.827 --> 01:02:29.016
Oh, you're

01:02:29.017 --> 01:02:30.205
gonna tell him.

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:31.748
How's he gonna take it?

01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:32.989
- The way I'm
- gonna tell him?

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:35.586
Not well.

01:02:35.627 --> 01:02:37.087
Oh, my God, I should sell

01:02:37.088 --> 01:02:38.547
tickets to this meeting.

01:02:39.631 --> 01:02:41.841
Daddy? Daddy?

01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:42.884
Sweetheart,

01:02:42.885 --> 01:02:43.885
what's wrong?

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:45.366
I thought you left

01:02:45.367 --> 01:02:46.804
without saying goodbye.

01:02:46.846 --> 01:02:48.431
Oh, well, you were

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:50.016
sleeping, honey.

01:02:50.058 --> 01:02:51.809
- I didn't want to
- wake you up.

01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:53.103
You always have to

01:02:53.104 --> 01:02:54.354
say goodbye, Daddy.

01:02:54.396 --> 01:02:55.752
And give me my milk

01:02:55.753 --> 01:02:57.107
and watch cartoons.

01:02:54.396 --> 01:02:57.107
Okay.

01:02:57.148 --> 01:02:58.400
Okay, okay, okay,

01:02:58.401 --> 01:02:59.651
okay, I'm sorry.

01:02:59.693 --> 01:03:01.528
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:02.759
I'll do it tomorrow,

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:03.947
okay? I promise.

01:03:04.698 --> 01:03:06.283
Okay.

01:03:21.214 --> 01:03:22.528
Oh, yeah, what, and what?

01:03:22.529 --> 01:03:23.841
Yup.

01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:26.720
Okay, and how 'bout

01:03:26.721 --> 01:03:29.556
the headphones for

01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:29.556
good measure, okay?

01:03:29.598 --> 01:03:30.641
Your lucky day.

01:03:30.642 --> 01:03:31.683
I'm giving you a break.

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:32.976
But you got two. Okay?

01:03:32.977 --> 01:03:34.227
Thanks.

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:36.938
For the smart-ass look

01:03:36.939 --> 01:03:37.981
you just gave me.

01:03:38.022 --> 01:03:40.858
Yeah. Enjoy it. Okay?

01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:43.861
I don't... I don't need it.

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:46.072
Listen, the whole

01:03:46.073 --> 01:03:48.241
Brian Campbell situation

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:48.241
is unfortunate.

01:03:48.283 --> 01:03:49.576
But, uh, I have nothing

01:03:49.577 --> 01:03:50.868
to say about it.

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:52.972
Well, you just
- said it was unfortunate.

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:54.539
Then I have nothing

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.082
else to say about it,

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:56.082
okay, Mr. Grammar?

01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:57.313
We were hoping to talk

01:03:57.314 --> 01:03:58.502
to Principal Douche about it.

01:03:58.543 --> 01:04:00.358
Yeah, that's

01:04:00.359 --> 01:04:02.172
not gonna happen.

01:04:02.213 --> 01:04:03.757
It's a brand new day.

01:04:03.758 --> 01:04:05.300
They offered me my job back.

01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:06.635
I did not take it.

01:04:06.677 --> 01:04:07.949
I've been offered jobs

01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:09.220
at other schools

01:04:06.677 --> 01:04:09.220
over the years

01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:10.888
and I stayed there

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:12.620
because I thought

01:04:12.621 --> 01:04:14.309
things were gonna change.

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:14.309
I thought Douche...

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:15.623
Look, the douche

01:04:15.624 --> 01:04:16.894
will be the douche

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:16.894
for the rest of his life.

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:18.706
- He's gonna have to wake up,
- look in the mirror,

01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:19.814
And see himself, and that's

01:04:19.815 --> 01:04:20.898
enough punishment for me.

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:22.776
I kind of hope

01:04:22.777 --> 01:04:24.611
he wakes up with VD.

01:04:24.653 --> 01:04:25.862
Ah! That's

01:04:25.863 --> 01:04:27.071
a little bad karma.

01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:28.677
Not... Just the kind

01:04:28.678 --> 01:04:30.241
that hurts when he pees.

01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:32.014
Burning.

01:04:32.015 --> 01:04:33.036
Yes.

01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:35.330
"Who is"

01:04:35.331 --> 01:04:36.331
the third president of

01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:36.331
"the United States?"

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:37.645
Answer,

01:04:37.646 --> 01:04:38.916
"Mr. Donovan's a homo."

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:40.627
It's not true, it's

01:04:40.628 --> 01:04:42.295
mean, it's politically

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:42.295
incorrect, and I just...

01:04:42.337 --> 01:04:43.380
These kids, I don't

01:04:43.381 --> 01:04:44.422
know what to do

01:04:42.337 --> 01:04:44.422
with them, I mean,

01:04:44.464 --> 01:04:46.400
- I come in every day and
- I do my best and they just

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:47.675
Yell and they don't listen

01:04:47.676 --> 01:04:48.926
and I don't know how

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:48.926
to control them.

01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:50.637
- No, that's your
- first mistake.

01:04:50.679 --> 01:04:52.114
- You're not gonna be
- able to control them.

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:53.535
They're very energetic,

01:04:53.536 --> 01:04:54.932
they're gonna be

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:54.932
all over the place.

01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:56.393
What you have to

01:04:56.394 --> 01:04:57.811
do is learn to

01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:57.811
conserve that energy

01:04:57.853 --> 01:04:59.334
and try and redirect them

01:04:59.335 --> 01:05:00.814
in the direction you

01:04:57.853 --> 01:05:00.814
want them to go in.

01:05:00.856 --> 01:05:02.482
- What are you
- guys talking about?

01:05:02.524 --> 01:05:03.671
Ian's just having a

01:05:03.672 --> 01:05:04.818
little trouble in his

01:05:02.524 --> 01:05:04.818
history class.

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:06.695
- A lot of trouble.
- History?

01:05:06.737 --> 01:05:07.842
Mmm-hmm.

01:05:07.843 --> 01:05:08.946
Who cares about that?

01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:10.532
I'm in the robot business,

01:05:10.533 --> 01:05:12.075
and business is booming.

01:05:14.285 --> 01:05:15.453
What's the width

01:05:15.454 --> 01:05:16.621
of a child's neck?

01:05:20.834 --> 01:05:22.627
- Actually, business
- is not booming.

01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:24.150
Season's off to a

01:05:24.151 --> 01:05:25.630
terrible start and

01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:25.630
I'm not handling it well.

01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:26.940
- You call this
- efficient torque?

01:05:26.964 --> 01:05:28.216
- Yeah.
- Is that a joke?

01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:29.967
- I have a joke for you.
- Knock knock.

01:05:30.009 --> 01:05:31.969
- Who's there?
- Second place!

01:05:32.011 --> 01:05:33.304
Are you insane?

01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:34.972
Terrible! Start over!

01:05:35.014 --> 01:05:36.367
- What do you have?
- It's hyperbolic.

01:05:36.391 --> 01:05:38.035
- Get under the table.
- Get under the table.

01:05:38.059 --> 01:05:39.895
Slide over, slide over.

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:40.979
What do you have

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.021
here? What is...

01:05:44.023 --> 01:05:45.504
Actually, that's pretty

01:05:45.505 --> 01:05:46.984
good. All right.

01:05:44.023 --> 01:05:46.984
You keep up the good work.

01:05:47.026 --> 01:05:48.779
- Oh, don't be
- such a crybaby.

01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:53.929
Yeah, Mitch won

01:05:53.930 --> 01:05:55.201
Teacher of the Year.

01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:55.201
I've accepted that.

01:05:55.243 --> 01:05:56.307
But I will tell

01:05:56.308 --> 01:05:57.370
you, it's not just

01:05:55.243 --> 01:05:57.370
about teaching.

01:05:57.412 --> 01:05:58.705
Huh? He has a vest

01:05:58.706 --> 01:05:59.997
on all the time.

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:01.040
Who's the

01:06:01.041 --> 01:06:02.041
teacher in the vest?

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:03.147
Teacher in the

01:06:03.148 --> 01:06:04.210
vest, vest, vest.

01:06:04.252 --> 01:06:06.588
Kardashian. Jesse James.

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:08.215
Jesus. Publicity

01:06:08.216 --> 01:06:09.800
figures. Boom. Huh?

01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:11.405
Not me anymore.

01:06:11.406 --> 01:06:12.969
Next year,

01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:12.969
whole new attitude.

01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:14.325
Oh, who's the guy

01:06:14.326 --> 01:06:15.639
in the new glasses?

01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:19.016
Teacher of the Year.

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:21.018
Honestly, she's
- got nothing going on.

01:06:23.062 --> 01:06:24.355
'Cause she's brain-dead.

01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:34.031
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:06:34.073 --> 01:06:36.555
Brought your lunch.

01:06:36.556 --> 01:06:39.036
Oh, how sweet, Mitchie,

01:06:34.073 --> 01:06:39.036
Mommy brought you lunchie!

01:06:40.204 --> 01:06:41.936
Can I...

01:06:41.937 --> 01:06:43.667
Can we go to your room

01:06:40.204 --> 01:06:43.667
for just a sec?

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:45.376
- Yeah.
- Ooh!

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:46.899
Shut up!

01:06:54.093 --> 01:06:55.449
Don't take it.

01:06:56.847 --> 01:06:57.952
If you think it's the

01:06:57.953 --> 01:06:59.056
wrong move, don't take it.

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:00.662
No, no, no, I have to.

01:07:00.663 --> 01:07:02.226
I have to.

01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:04.458
Yeah, I know I said

01:07:04.459 --> 01:07:06.648
that, but...

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:08.775
I was wrong.

01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:11.382
I... I don't want to

01:07:11.383 --> 01:07:12.654
see you working so hard.

01:07:12.696 --> 01:07:14.865
You're killing yourself.

01:07:14.906 --> 01:07:15.970
But I don't mind it.

01:07:15.971 --> 01:07:17.033
But I do.

01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:20.119
I do.

01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:26.042
- I just want us
- to be together.

01:07:28.336 --> 01:07:29.671
We will be.

01:07:30.588 --> 01:07:32.757
We are.

01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:34.133
Always.

01:07:37.136 --> 01:07:38.242
Okay.

01:07:38.243 --> 01:07:39.347
Okay.

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:49.124
So, when will you
- tell your students?

01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:51.108
That I'm leaving?

01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:53.444
Um, I don't know.

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:56.823
I might not

01:07:56.824 --> 01:07:58.115
tell them at all.

01:07:58.157 --> 01:08:00.117
- Isn't that
- the coward's way out?

01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:01.452
Absolutely.

01:08:01.494 --> 01:08:03.580
Yeah, but I'm just

01:08:03.581 --> 01:08:05.665
not sure that I could

01:08:01.494 --> 01:08:05.665
handle the goodbye.

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:08.668
You're quitting? Why?

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:10.045
Well actually, Ron, I'm

01:08:10.046 --> 01:08:11.379
quitting because of you.

01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:12.860
Me? Why? Have you

01:08:12.861 --> 01:08:14.298
told other people?

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:15.800
No, of course not.

01:08:15.801 --> 01:08:17.260
Come on, relax, I'm not

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:17.260
quitting because of you.

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:20.136
Oh, my God. God!

01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:21.514
Why would you say that?

01:08:21.555 --> 01:08:23.224
- Because I'm trying
- to help you out.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.600
I'm trying to help you

01:08:24.602 --> 01:08:25.935
understand why the teachers

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:25.935
don't respect you

01:08:25.977 --> 01:08:27.645
- and the kids
- don't like you.

01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:28.917
I don't know either of

01:08:28.917 --> 01:08:30.147
those things to be true.

01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:30.147
Sure you are.

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:31.566
And I know it's killing

01:08:31.567 --> 01:08:32.943
you because you're trying

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:32.943
so hard to be liked.

01:08:32.984 --> 01:08:34.298
Yes, I try very hard.

01:08:34.299 --> 01:08:35.612
Yeah, I know, and

01:08:32.984 --> 01:08:35.612
that's the problem.

01:08:35.653 --> 01:08:36.925
It's not your job

01:08:36.926 --> 01:08:38.197
to be liked, it's

01:08:35.653 --> 01:08:38.197
your job to lead.

01:08:38.238 --> 01:08:39.261
Well, you know what,

01:08:39.261 --> 01:08:40.283
I just think that maybe

01:08:40.323 --> 01:08:42.261
- you and I have very - different ideas about
- How to do this job.

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:43.807
You remember when you

01:08:43.808 --> 01:08:45.328
invited the entire faculty

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:45.328
to your birthday party

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:46.622
except for three teachers?

01:08:46.663 --> 01:08:48.165
I realized my mistake,

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:49.667
- and I invited them
- the next day.

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:51.270
- Do you remember
- the meeting you called

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:52.897
- To draft a new mission
- statement for the school,

01:08:52.921 --> 01:08:54.720
- And you invited the
- teachers, the parents,

01:08:54.756 --> 01:08:55.756
And the kids all into

01:08:55.758 --> 01:08:56.758
the same room?

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.988
That wasn't my meeting.

01:08:57.988 --> 01:08:59.176
It was a zoo, Ron.

01:08:59.218 --> 01:09:01.196
- I mean, the teachers were
- fighting with each other,

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.388
Calling each other

01:09:02.389 --> 01:09:03.555
names in front of the

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.555
parents and the kids.

01:09:03.598 --> 01:09:05.015
That was Rita's meeting.

01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:06.330
They are all

01:09:06.331 --> 01:09:07.602
your meetings!

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:09.437
- God! Can't you
- just own it?

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:10.584
Can't you just say,

01:09:10.585 --> 01:09:11.689
"Yeah, I am responsible"?

01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:13.691
- Aren't you tired of
- being such a pussy?

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:15.044
- You know what,
- you win one award

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:16.090
And you think you

01:09:16.091 --> 01:09:17.112
know everything,

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:17.112
huh? Is that it?

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:18.404
I know what the students

01:09:18.406 --> 01:09:19.656
of Truman think of me.

01:09:19.697 --> 01:09:21.573
- Ron, the kids
- think you're a dick.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:25.620
Okay.

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:27.122
We're finished here.

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:28.999
Yeah, it's okay.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.332
I was already done.

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:33.711
Jesus Christ.

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:36.649
- That might be a little - bit more than
- He's used to, huh?

01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:37.924
You think?

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:49.243
- All right, guys, - you had a great week
- Of practice.

01:09:49.268 --> 01:09:50.562
Just remember, we play

01:09:50.563 --> 01:09:51.854
together, we win together.

01:09:51.895 --> 01:09:53.023
- Count off.
- One!

01:09:53.064 --> 01:09:54.398
- Count off!
- One!

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.441
Right, that's right,

01:09:55.442 --> 01:09:56.442
you play as one,

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.442
and we will win!

01:09:56.484 --> 01:09:57.986
Hands up!

01:09:58.028 --> 01:09:59.254
- One, two, three.
- Titans!

01:09:59.278 --> 01:10:00.634
Let's go, boys. Get out there.

01:10:02.032 --> 01:10:03.616
- They'll win a game
- at some point.

01:10:03.658 --> 01:10:05.702
Eh, probably not today,

01:10:05.703 --> 01:10:07.745
though. Um, this team

01:10:03.658 --> 01:10:07.745
is pretty tough,

01:10:07.787 --> 01:10:09.765
- but my guys are making
- a lot of good decisions,

01:10:09.789 --> 01:10:10.916
And they'll be rewarded

01:10:10.917 --> 01:10:12.042
for that eventually.

01:10:13.001 --> 01:10:14.961
Yeah, all right, Chris!

01:10:15.003 --> 01:10:16.379
- Nice stop,
- buddy, nice stop.

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:18.715
Let's go, get it out now!

01:10:18.756 --> 01:10:20.133
Teaching sometimes feels

01:10:20.134 --> 01:10:21.509
like you're leading the

01:10:18.756 --> 01:10:21.509
kids through a dense fog.

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:22.782
Uh, the worst part of this

01:10:22.783 --> 01:10:24.012
job is the fear

01:10:24.054 --> 01:10:25.159
that you might not be

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.263
taking them in

01:10:24.054 --> 01:10:26.263
the right direction.

01:10:26.305 --> 01:10:27.557
Come on, push it up,

01:10:27.558 --> 01:10:28.808
push it up.

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:30.748
And then, suddenly, it's

01:10:30.749 --> 01:10:32.645
nothing but clear skies.

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:03.861
So, when will you
- tell your students?

01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:05.595
That I'm leaving?

01:11:05.636 --> 01:11:08.264
Um, I don't know.

01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:11.726
I might not

01:11:11.727 --> 01:11:13.103
tell them at all.

01:11:13.144 --> 01:11:14.687
- Isn't that
- the coward's way out?

01:11:14.729 --> 01:11:16.313
Absolutely.

01:11:16.355 --> 01:11:18.336
Yeah, but... I'm just

01:11:18.337 --> 01:11:20.317
not sure that I could

01:11:16.355 --> 01:11:20.317
handle the goodbye.

01:11:22.319 --> 01:11:23.967
You know,

01:11:23.968 --> 01:11:25.615
uh, we've been talking

01:11:22.319 --> 01:11:25.615
to them all week.

01:11:26.741 --> 01:11:28.034
The students?

01:11:28.035 --> 01:11:29.326
What'd they say?

01:11:29.368 --> 01:11:30.557
He works harder than any

01:11:30.558 --> 01:11:31.746
teacher I've ever seen.

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:33.060
He's kept me after class

01:11:33.061 --> 01:11:34.331
and said,

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:36.104
you know, like,

01:11:36.105 --> 01:11:37.835
"Don't act like I'm forcing

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:37.835
this knowledge on you."

01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:39.546
You know, "I got something"

01:11:39.547 --> 01:11:41.214
that belongs to you,

01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:41.214
"so you gotta take it."

01:11:41.256 --> 01:11:42.298
When he talks

01:11:42.299 --> 01:11:43.340
to you like that,

01:11:41.256 --> 01:11:43.340
let me tell you,

01:11:43.382 --> 01:11:44.571
that'll make your ass

01:11:44.572 --> 01:11:45.760
pick up a book and study.

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:47.470
- He had a real
- cool swag about him.

01:11:48.596 --> 01:11:49.764
Man, thank you for

01:11:49.765 --> 01:11:50.932
your swag, Mr. Carter.

01:11:50.974 --> 01:11:52.774
- I told him I
- wasn't a good writer.

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:54.351
He says we're all writers.

01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:56.437
He doesn't just make
- you a better writer.

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:57.772
He changes the

01:11:57.773 --> 01:11:59.065
way you think.

01:11:59.107 --> 01:12:02.377
- For the longest time, - I didn't know what I wanted
- To do with my life, you know?

01:12:02.401 --> 01:12:03.945
But now, I do.

01:12:03.987 --> 01:12:05.655
I want to be a teacher.

01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:06.823
He's the best.

01:12:06.864 --> 01:12:08.074
The best.

01:12:08.116 --> 01:12:09.492
The best.

01:12:11.286 --> 01:12:12.726
- He's the best
- teacher I ever had.

01:12:18.042 --> 01:12:19.607
Well, that means

01:12:19.608 --> 01:12:21.171
a lot. Thank you.

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:25.154
My daddy helps kids

01:12:25.155 --> 01:12:26.968
learn and get smarter.

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:28.574
He helps them read and write

01:12:28.575 --> 01:12:30.138
and have a better life.

01:12:30.805 --> 01:12:33.432
My daddy is a teacher.

01:12:45.444 --> 01:12:46.779
We did the VFW.

01:12:46.821 --> 01:12:47.927
Yes, we did the VFW.

01:12:47.928 --> 01:12:49.032
Definitely won't be

01:12:46.821 --> 01:12:49.032
going to that one again.

01:12:49.073 --> 01:12:50.574
- We did, and we
- did a preschool.

01:12:50.616 --> 01:12:52.416
- We did the preschool.
- Those kids loved it.

01:12:52.451 --> 01:12:54.096
- Yeah, they were into it.
- They were into it.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.767
They. They were

01:12:55.768 --> 01:12:57.414
clapping and singing and...

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:57.414
Singin' right along.

01:12:57.456 --> 01:12:59.101
- They didn't even - know the words either.
- No.

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:00.894
- And I think, sometimes - when you don't know
- The words, it...

01:13:00.918 --> 01:13:02.212
It's better.

01:13:02.253 --> 01:13:04.106
- It frees you. - Why do you need to
- Know words to songs?

01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:05.649
- A lot of times,
- words hold you back.

01:13:05.673 --> 01:13:07.383
- Okay, let's
- lose the smirk.

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:09.761
Oh, and you're

01:13:09.762 --> 01:13:10.803
still gonna... You're

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:10.803
still gonna laugh.

01:13:10.845 --> 01:13:12.388
Okay, that's fine.

01:13:12.429 --> 01:13:15.036
I will be treated

01:13:15.037 --> 01:13:17.643
fairly and

01:13:12.429 --> 01:13:17.643
taken seriously.

01:13:17.685 --> 01:13:19.395
- Okay?
- So enjoy it.

01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:22.815
I'm not gonna write

01:13:22.816 --> 01:13:24.441
all that out

01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:24.441
again, you know.

01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:25.568
Maintaining a

01:13:25.569 --> 01:13:26.652
strong relationship

01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:26.652
with the parents,

01:13:26.694 --> 01:13:27.716
well, that,

01:13:27.717 --> 01:13:28.738
that's another key.

01:13:28.779 --> 01:13:30.010
Nia, uh, would you

01:13:30.011 --> 01:13:31.241
excuse us, please?

01:13:31.782 --> 01:13:33.326
- Nia, please.
- Okay.

01:13:33.368 --> 01:13:34.369
He's gonna use his

01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:35.370
imagination on Mommy.

01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:38.769
I couldn't help

01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:40.041
notice you're not

01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:40.041
wearing a wedding ring.

01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:41.417
That is true.

01:13:41.458 --> 01:13:43.961
Um, neither am I.

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:45.338
- Look what we
- have in common.

01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:47.631
Oh, my God. Um...

01:13:48.716 --> 01:13:50.134
Secret is contacts.

01:13:50.176 --> 01:13:51.486
- You gotta have a lot of
- contacts, all over the place.

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:52.469
- We got them
- everywhere.

01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:53.697
- And you don't just
- have the contact,

01:13:53.721 --> 01:13:55.448
- I mean, you have to hang
- with these people.

01:13:55.472 --> 01:13:56.867
- You gotta get intimate
- with these people.

01:13:56.891 --> 01:13:57.993
You literally have to...

01:13:58.017 --> 01:13:59.102
Hang on a

01:13:59.103 --> 01:14:00.186
second. Hello?

01:14:03.398 --> 01:14:05.566
Okay. All right.

01:14:07.568 --> 01:14:09.195
- Who's that?
- Didn't get in.

01:14:09.237 --> 01:14:10.280
Great.

01:14:10.321 --> 01:14:11.655
- Another kid
- didn't get in.

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:13.592
- See, but that - opens up a slot
- For another kid.

01:14:13.616 --> 01:14:14.718
- So that's how
- we look at it.

01:14:14.742 --> 01:14:16.220
- You gotta have a
- positive attitude.

01:14:16.244 --> 01:14:17.512
- And then you
- gotta have contacts.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.499
- I don't know, but it
- seems to me

01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:23.814
That the trophy

01:14:23.815 --> 01:14:25.086
for Teacher of the Year

01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:25.086
ought to go

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:26.316
to the teacher

01:14:26.317 --> 01:14:27.504
with the most trophies.

01:14:27.546 --> 01:14:29.632
That's just math.

01:14:29.633 --> 01:14:31.717
But I don't teach math,

01:14:27.546 --> 01:14:31.717
I just teach robotics.

01:14:31.759 --> 01:14:33.407
That's not gonna be important

01:14:33.408 --> 01:14:35.054
in the future whatsoever.

01:14:35.096 --> 01:14:36.452
Whatever, just let the

01:14:36.453 --> 01:14:37.807
baby have his bottle.

01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:38.996
You plagiarized

01:14:38.997 --> 01:14:40.143
this whole paper.

01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:40.143
No, I didn't.

01:14:40.184 --> 01:14:41.352
Yes, you did, you cut

01:14:41.353 --> 01:14:42.519
and pasted the entire

01:14:40.184 --> 01:14:42.519
thing from the Internet.

01:14:42.561 --> 01:14:43.562
No!

01:14:43.563 --> 01:14:44.563
See here, you

01:14:42.561 --> 01:14:44.563
accidentally...

01:14:44.605 --> 01:14:45.752
So, you've been

01:14:45.753 --> 01:14:46.899
teaching for 25 years.

01:14:46.941 --> 01:14:49.319
25 years.

01:14:50.694 --> 01:14:51.716
Wow.

01:14:51.717 --> 01:14:52.738
Yeah.

01:14:53.781 --> 01:14:55.366
Wow.

01:15:01.456 --> 01:15:02.770
I don't know if that's

01:15:02.771 --> 01:15:04.083
in your frame. Is that

01:15:01.456 --> 01:15:04.083
what it's called, frame?

01:15:04.125 --> 01:15:05.397
I don't know if it's in

01:15:05.398 --> 01:15:06.669
your frame but there's

01:15:04.125 --> 01:15:06.669
some kids back there.

01:15:06.710 --> 01:15:07.732
Ready and willing

01:15:07.733 --> 01:15:08.754
and able to learn.

01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:12.591
So...

01:15:12.633 --> 01:15:14.611
- Let's have a great day of
- instruction, you guys, huh?

01:15:14.635 --> 01:15:15.928
Is that a knife, young man?

01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:16.992
What is that,

01:15:16.993 --> 01:15:18.014
is that a pen? Okay.

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:19.807
Truman's test scores are

01:15:19.808 --> 01:15:21.558
the highest in the area,

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:22.977
and I... I take a lot

01:15:22.978 --> 01:15:24.354
of pride in that.

01:15:24.395 --> 01:15:25.980
But besides myself, um,

01:15:25.981 --> 01:15:27.564
you know, the teachers

01:15:27.606 --> 01:15:29.379
are also a big part

01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:31.152
of the success here at Truman.

01:15:32.611 --> 01:15:33.925
Okay, you know what, I will

01:15:33.926 --> 01:15:35.239
give you each $5

01:15:35.281 --> 01:15:36.428
if you'll just be quiet

01:15:36.429 --> 01:15:37.574
for five minutes.

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:39.556
That's a dollar a minute,

01:15:39.557 --> 01:15:41.496
that's basically all

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:41.496
I'm making today.

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:43.414
I will give you today's

01:15:43.415 --> 01:15:45.291
salary if you will, please,

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:45.291
just listen to me.

01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:46.793
Uh, it's two white

01:15:46.794 --> 01:15:48.252
women, so...

01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:48.252
Oh, it is?

01:15:48.294 --> 01:15:49.295
Yeah.

01:15:49.296 --> 01:15:50.296
Oh, you didn't

01:15:48.294 --> 01:15:50.296
tell me that.

01:15:50.338 --> 01:15:51.861
Well, it's okay,

01:15:51.862 --> 01:15:53.383
it doesn't...

01:15:50.338 --> 01:15:53.383
Superfluous, really.

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:54.508
And so, let's just...

01:15:54.509 --> 01:15:55.592
You know,

01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:56.802
instead of introducing it,

01:15:56.803 --> 01:15:57.970
let's just play the song.

01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:57.970
Sure. Here we go.

01:15:58.012 --> 01:15:59.618
So this is Closer to Fine,

01:15:59.619 --> 01:16:01.224
and we are the Indigo Boys.

01:16:01.265 --> 01:16:02.329
Indigo Dudes.

01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:03.393
Dudes, I like that

01:16:01.265 --> 01:16:03.393
one better.

01:16:03.434 --> 01:16:05.228
- Actually,
- we should make a banner.

01:16:05.269 --> 01:16:06.896
Yeah, we should.

01:16:06.937 --> 01:16:08.835
As you know, I started

01:16:08.836 --> 01:16:10.733
the FIGHT program

01:16:06.937 --> 01:16:10.733
on campus this year.

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:14.570
Friendship.

01:16:14.611 --> 01:16:16.989
Intelligence.

01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:18.741
Gratitude.

01:16:18.782 --> 01:16:20.701
Humility.

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:22.619
And trust.

01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:24.642
These posters were meant

01:16:24.643 --> 01:16:26.623
to encourage the students.

01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:29.731
Whoever vandalized

01:16:29.732 --> 01:16:31.628
these posters

01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:32.880
didn't think about

01:16:32.881 --> 01:16:34.090
that for one second!

01:16:38.802 --> 01:16:40.637
- Some of you guys
- might be virgins.

01:16:40.679 --> 01:16:42.657
- It might be a little...
- It's okay, guys, it's okay.

01:16:42.681 --> 01:16:44.016
Sexuality.

01:16:44.017 --> 01:16:45.351
That's where you

01:16:42.681 --> 01:16:45.351
come into your own.

01:16:45.393 --> 01:16:47.037
- You literally come into
- it your own in college.

01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:48.250
I'll tell you where you're

01:16:48.251 --> 01:16:49.439
not gonna find

01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:49.439
your sexuality out.

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:50.940
- North Dakota.
- No.

01:16:50.981 --> 01:16:52.691
- That's a black hole
- of sexuality.

01:16:52.733 --> 01:16:53.734
I mean, nobody finds

01:16:53.735 --> 01:16:54.735
anything up there.

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:56.695
- I'm Asian, but I wear
- colored contacts

01:16:56.737 --> 01:16:58.655
To make my eyes blue.

01:16:58.697 --> 01:17:00.178
They say that's exactly

01:17:00.179 --> 01:17:01.658
what they're

01:16:58.697 --> 01:17:01.658
looking for at USC!

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:03.014
We were teaching

01:17:03.015 --> 01:17:04.328
that girl a lesson. Okay?

01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:05.517
You sometimes have to be

01:17:05.518 --> 01:17:06.663
fake to make it in LA.

01:17:06.705 --> 01:17:08.665
- USC, it's
- full of phonies.

01:17:08.707 --> 01:17:10.084
- Period. We said it.
- Right?

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:12.002
- You want to fit in,
- you be a phony.

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:13.191
And by the way, I would

01:17:13.192 --> 01:17:14.338
say that to USC's face.

01:17:15.339 --> 01:17:16.942
- You're a phony, USC.
- If they had a face.

01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:18.321
If USC had a face...

01:17:18.322 --> 01:17:19.676
I'll say it to

01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:19.676
George Lucas.

01:17:19.718 --> 01:17:21.762
You're a phony.

01:17:21.804 --> 01:17:23.698
- Yeah, no. I know Mitch
- won Teacher of the Year

01:17:23.722 --> 01:17:24.681
- And I'm okay with it now,
- I've accepted it.

01:17:24.723 --> 01:17:25.787
He's plays the rube in

01:17:25.788 --> 01:17:26.850
from the farm, right?

01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:28.811
I'm the guy in the vest.

01:17:28.812 --> 01:17:30.729
Oh! Scarecrow.

01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:30.729
Not buying it.

01:17:30.771 --> 01:17:32.689
- You know what it is?
- It's branding.

01:17:32.731 --> 01:17:33.920
That's what he's done.

01:17:33.921 --> 01:17:35.109
It's like a sex tape.

01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:36.402
In the guise of a vest.

01:17:36.444 --> 01:17:37.694
No. No!

01:17:37.736 --> 01:17:39.217
I want you to know

01:17:39.218 --> 01:17:40.697
that you may

01:17:37.736 --> 01:17:40.697
think this is funny,

01:17:40.739 --> 01:17:42.491
but this is not some

01:17:42.492 --> 01:17:44.243
kind of joke, okay?

01:17:44.285 --> 01:17:45.703
And if I ever find

01:17:45.704 --> 01:17:47.121
out where this

01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:49.290
fight and drug club

01:17:49.291 --> 01:17:51.417
is meeting,

01:17:51.459 --> 01:17:53.919
I will ruin you!

01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:55.067
Soft sticks,

01:17:55.068 --> 01:17:56.172
lightly on the slap.

01:17:56.213 --> 01:17:58.150
- Right in front of... - You guys have the
- Clickers and everything.

01:17:58.174 --> 01:17:59.675
Hold up, man.

01:18:00.884 --> 01:18:02.011
That's terrific.

01:18:02.052 --> 01:18:04.013
- We're gonna
- brighten this up here.

01:18:05.473 --> 01:18:06.516
There we go.

01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:07.724
It's brightening it up!

01:18:07.766 --> 01:18:08.910
- Brightening it up.
- Interesting.

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:10.061
I didn't know that

01:18:10.062 --> 01:18:11.187
you could do that. Wow.

01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:13.480
Do you call this

01:18:13.481 --> 01:18:14.731
efficient torque?

01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:14.731
Yeah.

01:18:14.773 --> 01:18:16.973
- Okay, I have a - joke for you then.
- Uh, knock knock.

01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:18.486
Knock knock?

01:18:18.528 --> 01:18:19.592
Knock knock.

01:18:19.593 --> 01:18:20.655
Knock knock?

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:21.756
Go back to the top.

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.740
- I was gonna
- play it out,

01:18:23.782 --> 01:18:25.284
- 'cause it's
- almost even funnier.

01:18:25.326 --> 01:18:26.932
You all right?

01:18:25.326 --> 01:18:28.538
Sorry. Almond.

01:18:28.579 --> 01:18:29.643
Nevada.

01:18:29.644 --> 01:18:30.706
Nevada. Stay away

01:18:28.579 --> 01:18:30.706
from Nevada.

01:18:31.332 --> 01:18:32.749
You can go.

01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:34.151
- But you're gonna
- kill a hooker.

01:18:38.755 --> 01:18:40.174
Pause, pause, pause.

01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:46.722
Ooh!

01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:50.100
Okay, we rolling?

01:18:52.603 --> 01:18:54.104
- That's good.
- Yeah?

01:18:54.146 --> 01:18:55.415
- Yeah, you learned a chord. - I'm gonna
- Just play this chord.

01:18:55.439 --> 01:18:56.607
- Yeah.
- Over and over.

01:18:56.649 --> 01:18:58.234
Plenty.

01:18:58.275 --> 01:19:00.170
- Trust me, that's how - Poison got a career,
- So don't sweat it.

01:19:00.194 --> 01:19:02.196
My balls are itchy.

01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:03.923
Slow down so I can
- hear the word "balls."

01:19:03.947 --> 01:19:05.782
My balls are itchy.

01:19:05.824 --> 01:19:07.951
My balls are itchy.

01:19:08.994 --> 01:19:10.787
Think about it.

01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:12.122
- Look, you wanna act?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:19:12.164 --> 01:19:13.770
Act itchy balls.

01:19:13.771 --> 01:19:15.376
Act like you

01:19:12.164 --> 01:19:15.376
got itchy balls.

01:19:15.418 --> 01:19:16.627
Make 'em itch.

01:19:17.878 --> 01:19:20.548
My balls are itchy.

01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:21.737
If I was telling you

01:19:21.738 --> 01:19:22.883
my balls itch,

01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:22.883
I would tell you...

01:19:22.925 --> 01:19:24.323
This is how I would say

01:19:24.324 --> 01:19:25.720
it, "My balls are itchy."

01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:27.304
My balls are itchy.

01:19:34.478 --> 01:19:36.001
All right, Arno,

01:19:36.002 --> 01:19:37.523

01:19:37.565 --> 01:19:38.833
