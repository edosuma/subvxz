19:16.073 --> 19:18.325
Um, why didn't you tell me?

19:18.408 --> 19:20.786
Mitchell, you and I don't have
a relationship any more.

19:20.869 --> 19:26.208
I called you after our little visit
to the nurse's room.

19:26.291 --> 19:27.959
You never returned any of my calls.

19:28.043 --> 19:30.003
I was freaked out, Tracy,
and I-

19:30.087 --> 19:34.299
Let's not rehash the past,
but rather focus on the future.

19:34.383 --> 19:35.676
Yes. Yes.

19:35.759 --> 19:38.387
Cam and I wanna know
if you're open...

19:38.470 --> 19:41.932
to us...
getting to know Bobby.

19:42.933 --> 19:44.518
I don't think that's a very good idea.

19:44.601 --> 19:47.020
Okay. I understand. No.
It might be a little awkward at first,

19:47.104 --> 19:48.897
but I think after some time-

19:48.980 --> 19:50.482
We brought him a present.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.194
For Bobby? [ Cameron ] Mm-hmm.

19:54.277 --> 19:56.947
Please, we just-
We really just want to meet him.

19:58.448 --> 19:59.950
Fine.

20:00.826 --> 20:02.577

Hey, honey. What's up?
Honey,

20:10.168 --> 20:14.005
I wanted to introduce you
to Mitchell and Cameron.

20:14.131 --> 20:15.966
This is my husband.
Hey. How you doin'?

20:16.091 --> 20:17.551
Hey, what's up, dude?
How you doin'?

20:17.676 --> 20:19.219
Nice to meet you.
Yeah, hi. Cameron.

Hi there.

How- We-

20:25.434 --> 20:26.643
Mitchell took me to the prom.

20:26.768 --> 20:27.936
The prom.
To the prom.

20:28.019 --> 20:31.982
Oh, a redhead.
You really have a type, don't you?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.569
Um, they got you
a present.

20:35.694 --> 20:37.154
It's not- it's just a little-
[ Stammering ]

20:37.279 --> 20:38.780
You don't need to-
I wouldn't even-

20:41.616 --> 20:43.118
“Little Slugger”?

20:44.953 --> 20:48.331

S'up?
[ Chuckles ] [ Door Closes ]

20:59.259 --> 21:01.970
I never realized
you ever had sex with a girl.

21:02.053 --> 21:03.722
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

21:03.805 --> 21:05.766
I kinda got around
back then, actually.

21:05.891 --> 21:07.601
More than one?
Please.

21:07.684 --> 21:08.852
There was Tracy. Who else?

21:08.935 --> 21:10.687
Uh, Betty Rizzo.

21:10.771 --> 21:12.272
Don't remember her.

21:12.355 --> 21:14.858
Eliza Doolittle? Nellie Forbush?

21:14.941 --> 21:15.901
These were classmates?

21:15.984 --> 21:17.444

Liesl and Gretl von Trapp.

21:23.825 --> 21:25.660
Sisters, obviously. Too far?

21:25.744 --> 21:28.497
I'm not an idiot. You played that record
night and day.

21:28.580 --> 21:30.290
Why would you tell me
a thing like that?
