All our dreams are
about to come true.

Suzanne Somers is coming
back to prime time?

01:51.545 --> 01:54.447
No. No, Balki,
that’s your dream.

01:54.480 --> 01:57.584
What I mean is we
are going to be rich!

01:57.618 --> 01:59.920
Cousin, I’d
love to be rich

01:59.953 --> 02:02.889
but don’t that
require money?

02:02.923 --> 02:05.726
No. No. You don’t understand.
We are going to be rich!

02:05.759 --> 02:08.662
But first, we are
going to buy a house.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.697
I’d love to buy a house.

02:10.731 --> 02:13.700
But again, don’t we have
that same pesky money problem?

02:15.301 --> 02:16.436
No. No. We don’t.

02:16.469 --> 02:20.473
I just came from a seminar
called "Dare To Make A Fortune."

It shows you how to buy
a house for no money down.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.879
It was brilliant.
Now, I have a plan.

02:25.912 --> 02:27.413
Oh, God.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.184
A plan that is going
to make us both rich

02:31.217 --> 02:33.754

02:33.787 --> 02:35.822
Cousin, I’ve been
keeping some notes

on plans you’ve
had over the years.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.272
have cost me

02:53.974 --> 02:56.810

required an ointment.

I guess you can do that.

to the part where I give in?

03:27.574 --> 03:29.510

03:29.543 --> 03:31.712
Now, here’s the plan.
We buy a house.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.446
We get the owner
to carry back paper.

03:33.479 --> 03:35.982
We don’t need money because
the seller takes a second

03:36.016 --> 03:37.984
reimburses the buyer
for the amount of the down.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.953

came after, "Alright, partner."

Trust me, Balki,
I’ll guide you through it.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.029
After we buy
a house for no money

03:49.062 --> 03:50.697
we fix it up a little
and then we sell it.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.866
We use the profits
to buy a better house.

03:52.899 --> 03:53.734
And then we
sell that house

03:53.767 --> 03:55.702
for an even bigger
profit and so on.

03:55.736 --> 03:59.573
So what do you say, Balki?
Shall we dare to make a fortune?

is the other house

chandelier in the entry.

want for this place.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.322
Come on, let’s hoist
this baby into place.

11:33.159 --> 11:35.428
‐Alright, ready?
‐Yeah.

11:35.461 --> 11:36.963
Pull.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.933
[grunting]

11:46.272 --> 11:48.809
‐Are we there yet?
‐No.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.977
It’s not working.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.780
Balki, we’re using too much
brawn, not enough brains.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.249
What we need
is more leverage.

11:56.282 --> 11:57.984
Balki, follow me.

12:14.535 --> 12:15.769
Grab on to the rope.

12:15.802 --> 12:17.771
[spits]

12:21.508 --> 12:23.176
‐You ready?
‐Yeah.

12:32.118 --> 12:33.353
There we go.

12:34.821 --> 12:37.423
Balki, a couple more
jumps off the stairs

12:37.457 --> 12:39.459
and we’ll have
this baby in place.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.062
[tinkling]

12:42.095 --> 12:43.296
Cousin!

12:43.329 --> 12:44.430
Cousin!

12:44.464 --> 12:45.999
‐You hear that?
‐What?

12:46.032 --> 12:48.168
It’s the ice cream truck
coming down the street!

12:48.201 --> 12:51.104
Huh? Whoa! Balki!

12:51.137 --> 12:52.539
Balki! Balki!

13:02.516 --> 13:03.917
Sorry, cousin.

13:05.151 --> 13:07.854
[instrumental music]

13:07.888 --> 13:11.424
Well, Balki, we’re
in the home stretch.

13:11.457 --> 13:14.227
All we have to do is finish
putting in these light bulbs

13:14.260 --> 13:17.063
then we can sell this baby
and move on to our next house.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.032
Well, cousin, if we do...

13:19.065 --> 13:21.434
...we’ll have to start
a new category for your plans.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.204
‐Yeah? What’s that?
‐Plans that work.

13:25.338 --> 13:27.207
Whoop! Whoa!

13:27.240 --> 13:28.809
‐Careful.
‐Sorry.

13:30.544 --> 13:33.113
Let’s just finish putting
in these light bulbs.

13:36.950 --> 13:37.984
Ah!

13:38.018 --> 13:40.020
Ah! Balki!

13:40.053 --> 13:42.288
Get the ladder!
Get the ladder!

13:42.322 --> 13:44.424
Get the ladder! Whoo...

13:44.457 --> 13:46.860
Get the ladder!
Get the ladder, Balki!

13:46.893 --> 13:48.428
Oh! Oh!

13:49.295 --> 13:52.265
[instrumental music]

13:57.270 --> 14:00.206
[instrumental music]

14:08.014 --> 14:10.283
Well, cousin, we’re
in the home stretch.

14:12.118 --> 14:15.255
All we have to do is find
a way to get down from here

14:15.288 --> 14:19.192
and then we can sell this baby
and move on to our next house.

14:19.225 --> 14:21.361
I don’t suppose you
went to a seminar on

14:21.394 --> 14:23.564
how to get out
of a light fixture?

14:27.934 --> 14:30.203
[tinkling]

14:31.371 --> 14:33.540
Come on, Balki, we
can get through this.

14:33.574 --> 14:35.375
It’s not like
we’re the first guys

14:35.408 --> 14:37.377
to get stuck
in a chandelier.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.448
Cousin, let’s be honest.
Jennifer was right.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.384
We‐we should have
hired professional help.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.521
I mean, cleaning
and‐and painting were easy

14:47.554 --> 14:50.591
but now we’re in
over our heads.

14:50.624 --> 14:54.227
In fact, I think we’re in
over most people’s heads.

14:55.529 --> 14:57.163
[thwacks]

14:57.564 --> 14:58.665
[gasps]

15:01.234 --> 15:04.938
Well, who had time
to hire professional help?

15:04.971 --> 15:06.006
We’re racing
against the clock.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.509
We got to sell this house
within the next ten days.

15:08.542 --> 15:10.243
Wait a minute,
why are we in such a hurry?

15:10.276 --> 15:12.045
I was hoping to join
the neighborhood watch

15:12.078 --> 15:14.080
and take a bite
out of crime.

15:15.682 --> 15:19.019
Balki...there is
part of the plan

15:19.052 --> 15:21.955
I didn’t tell you about.

15:21.988 --> 15:24.457
Nothing good can
follow that sentence.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.962
It’s true we bought
the house for no money down...

15:28.995 --> 15:32.165
...but in ten days...
our house payment is due.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.467
Uh‐huh.

15:35.569 --> 15:37.137
Just out of curiosity

15:37.170 --> 15:39.272
how much would that
house payment be?

15:39.305 --> 15:41.307
A hundred and forty
thousand dollars.

15:43.577 --> 15:48.214
A h‐hundred and forty
thousand dollars?

15:48.248 --> 15:50.717
I got a 30‐day loan.
I thought that’s all we needed.

15:50.751 --> 15:52.285
Who knew?

15:54.688 --> 15:56.022
Yoo‐hoo.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.925
Well, they said they
were gonna be here.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.364
Larry?

16:04.397 --> 16:06.299
Balki, are you here?

16:06.332 --> 16:08.602
‐Yes.
‐We’re up here.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.345
Hi, guys.
The house looks great.

16:21.582 --> 16:23.550
You should see
it from up here.

16:24.585 --> 16:26.553
This a bad time?

16:28.689 --> 16:30.156
No, no, no.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.158
We’re‐we’re just,
uh, finishing up.

16:32.192 --> 16:35.529
C‐could‐could you j‐just
slide that ladder over here?

16:39.633 --> 16:41.434
Okay, I owe you 20 bucks.

16:45.305 --> 16:48.374
[instrumental music]

16:48.408 --> 16:50.711
If you don’t like the color,
well, we can repaint.

16:50.744 --> 16:52.378
I‐I wanted
to go with cream.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.681
I‐I thought it would
look really nice in here...

16:58.652 --> 17:01.387
Looky‐loos.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.824
Balki, we haven’t
received a single offer.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.491
Our house payment is due.

17:05.526 --> 17:08.261
If we don’t get at least
a $140,000 for this house

17:08.294 --> 17:10.564
we’ll be ruined.

17:10.597 --> 17:13.366
Well, cousin, I...
I agree we’re in debt

17:13.398 --> 17:17.804
up to our chandelier,
but...I figured it out.

17:17.838 --> 17:19.839
If we sell
everything we own

17:19.873 --> 17:24.176
we’ll only
be short $132,000.

17:25.779 --> 17:27.714
[crying]

17:29.783 --> 17:32.619
Cousin, I can see nothing’s
going to cheer you up.

17:32.653 --> 17:34.588
[crying]
I don’t wanna...

17:37.758 --> 17:40.160
Are you the owners?

17:40.561 --> 17:42.128
Oh...

17:42.162 --> 17:43.363
...I know.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.632
The color’s wrong,
the rooms are too small.

17:45.666 --> 17:46.767
Thanks for stopping by.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.636
Well, yes, but we’re still
interested in the house.

17:50.671 --> 17:52.405
‐You are?
‐We’re the Hendersons.

17:52.438 --> 17:54.474
I’m Skitch and this
is my wife, Florence.

17:57.844 --> 18:00.480
‐Hello.
‐Well, you’re just in time.

18:00.514 --> 18:02.382
My associate and I
were just considering

18:02.415 --> 18:04.350
which offer on
the house to accept.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.588
‐We were?
‐Oh.

18:07.621 --> 18:09.856
‐You’ve had a lot of offers?
‐Yes.

18:11.692 --> 18:13.193
We have?

18:13.226 --> 18:15.596
Yes, uh, but we can
always consider another one.

18:15.629 --> 18:17.764
Don’t you agree,
Balki? Balki? Balki?

18:17.798 --> 18:19.866
[thwacks]

18:19.900 --> 18:23.303
Y‐yes, yes, i‐in fact,
if we had one more offer

18:23.336 --> 18:26.306
it might help us to decide
which offer to accept.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.610
Well, how much
are you asking?

18:29.643 --> 18:31.411
A hundred and seventy
thousand dollars.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.180
‐A hundred and twenty.
‐A hundred and twenty!

18:34.214 --> 18:36.216
Ow.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.218
You know, in some
parts of the world

18:38.251 --> 18:41.221
an offer that low would
be considered an insult.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.256
And my associate would
have to beat himself

18:43.289 --> 18:45.291
with a leather strap.

18:50.731 --> 18:54.200
I would like to point out
that the chandelier alone

18:54.234 --> 18:58.338
is worth $10,000.

18:58.371 --> 19:01.274
You won’t find another
one like it anywhere.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.677
Unless another
hotel goes belly up.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.680
Alright, a 140,000.

19:08.582 --> 19:09.650
[rattles]

19:09.683 --> 19:11.585
‐Ah! Ah! Ah!
‐I know. I know, Balki.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.587
I’m a little shocked
at their offer myself.

19:15.421 --> 19:16.957
A hundred and forty
thousand dollars.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.925
Mr. Henderson,
you can’t expect me

19:18.959 --> 19:22.428
to seriously consider
an offer that low.

19:22.462 --> 19:23.496
[rattles]

19:23.530 --> 19:24.931
[tinkling]

19:24.965 --> 19:26.633
Cousin. Cousin. Cousin.

19:26.667 --> 19:29.536
He’ll come up.

19:29.570 --> 19:34.340
Mr. Henderson, uh, my
price is a $170,000 firm.

19:35.976 --> 19:37.377
[rattles]

19:37.410 --> 19:38.512
Cousin. Cousin.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.380
No, Balki.
I’m not coming down.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.683
It’s not your coming
down that’s worrying me.

19:44.851 --> 19:48.221
Could you, could you excuse us?

19:48.254 --> 19:49.956
Cousin, the chandelier
is falling.

19:50.591 --> 19:52.225
[rattles]

19:52.258 --> 19:54.360
Oh, my Lord!

19:56.362 --> 19:57.531
We got to close
this deal fast.

19:57.564 --> 19:58.965
No, no, no, cousin.

19:58.999 --> 20:01.267
We can’t sell them a house
with a falling chandelier.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.669
Balki, if we sell
the house, I promise

20:02.703 --> 20:04.671
I’ll hire a professional
to fix the chandelier.

20:04.705 --> 20:05.939
‐You promise?
‐I promise.

20:05.972 --> 20:06.940
Okay.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.810
Yeah, a $140,000, you’ve
got yourself a house.

20:09.843 --> 20:12.245
Why don’t we walk out to my
car and sign the papers?

20:12.278 --> 20:13.947
Why don’t we run
out to your car?

20:13.980 --> 20:16.282
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
I’ve lost my contact lens.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.584
Oh, no, no, no.

20:19.720 --> 20:22.823
There’s a free set of contact
lenses come with the house.

20:22.856 --> 20:24.490
But I’d like my
contact lens, please‐‐

20:24.525 --> 20:27.027
‐No, no, no.
‐No, no, no.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.429
‐We’ll‐we’ll do it together.
‐Um, we...

20:32.332 --> 20:33.466
Ready?

20:34.968 --> 20:36.002
Yeah.

20:40.574 --> 20:43.510
[intense music]

20:46.580 --> 20:48.882
Oh! Oh! Oh!
I got it! I got it!

20:51.952 --> 20:53.754
Thank you very much.

20:53.787 --> 20:55.956
‐No trouble.
‐Is something wrong?

20:55.989 --> 20:58.992
No! No, no, everything is fine.
And congratulations.

20:59.025 --> 21:03.063
You just bought yourself
a house for a $140,000.

21:19.713 --> 21:21.648
Okay, a 135,000.

21:22.448 --> 21:25.385
[instrumental music]

21:32.058 --> 21:34.628
Well, cousin,
I figured it out.

21:34.661 --> 21:38.665
Daring to make a fortune
only cost us $42.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.736
A month.

21:45.038 --> 21:47.340
For the rest of our lives.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.378
I’m sorry, Balki.

21:52.412 --> 21:55.916
I guess I just let my greed
hormones run wild again.

21:57.618 --> 21:58.719
[sighs]

21:58.752 --> 21:59.986
I could have sold the house

22:00.020 --> 22:01.454
for a nice little profit.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.757
But no‐o‐o.

22:03.790 --> 22:06.993
It wasn’t enough
for Larry Appleton.

22:07.027 --> 22:09.963
[imitating Larry]
No‐o‐o, it wasn’t.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.799
‐I wanted more.
‐Ye‐e‐es, you did.

22:12.833 --> 22:16.503
‐Well, I learned my lesson.
‐Oh‐h‐h, I doubt that.

22:18.171 --> 22:19.806
No, Balki, I did.

22:19.840 --> 22:22.408
In fact, n‐next week
I’m taking a seminar

22:22.442 --> 22:24.845
"How To Profit
From Your Mistakes."

22:24.878 --> 22:27.147
Well, cousin,
if there is a profit

22:27.180 --> 22:29.616
to be made from mistakes...

22:29.650 --> 22:31.885
...you’re gonna be a rich man.
