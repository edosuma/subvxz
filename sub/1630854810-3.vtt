WEBVTT

00:13.596 --> 00:16.516
-The spirit is getting aggressive.
-That message is clearly a threat.

00:16.599 --> 00:19.602
-We have to give the box back.
-You know what's really scary?

00:20.603 --> 00:22.397
The ghost can write backwards.

00:29.195 --> 00:30.655
We can't give the box back now.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.866
If we give it back,
maybe the ghost will leave us alone.

00:32.949 --> 00:34.993
Maybe. Don't you think
we should know for sure

00:35.076 --> 00:37.120
before we hand over
the only leverage we have?

00:37.203 --> 00:39.622
I mean, if the ghost can lift a pen
to write a message,

00:39.706 --> 00:41.374
it can lift a knife to--

00:43.209 --> 00:44.961
-Is that her?
-Worse.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.379
-It's Leslie.
-Who's Leslie?

00:46.463 --> 00:47.505
-Hey.

00:52.552 --> 00:53.970
-It's my--
-No!

00:54.054 --> 00:55.346
Mm. Mm.

00:55.930 --> 00:56.931
'Sup, bitches?

01:03.772 --> 01:07.525
We need to consult an expert.
Someone who really knows about ghosts.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.319
-No offense, Demi.
-Actually, I agree.

01:09.402 --> 01:12.363
Not with your delivery, but with the fact
that I still have a lot to learn.

01:12.447 --> 01:15.200
Great. So we all agree
that Demi's not helpful. So who is?

01:15.283 --> 01:16.451
I just consulted Google.

01:16.534 --> 01:19.454
And it took me about 30 seconds
to find a local <i>bruja </i>named Cinnamon.

01:19.537 --> 01:20.747
The TikTok witch?

01:20.830 --> 01:23.583
I suggested her two days ago.
You called me "Dummy."

01:23.666 --> 01:28.254
Stop playing the victim, <i>Demi. </i>Huh?
Strong women lead by example.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.090
-She's doing an exorcism on a dog.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.841
-She's our girl.
-If we can find her.

01:31.925 --> 01:35.220
There's no way to contact her except DM.
And I sent her a message two days ago

01:35.303 --> 01:38.640
when <i>I</i> first thought of the idea,
and she still hasn't gotten back to me.

01:38.723 --> 01:41.101
-What do we do? Wait?
-What if we don't have time to wait?

01:45.146 --> 01:46.272
What are you doing here?

01:46.356 --> 01:48.233
Giving you a ride to school.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.235
-Yeah, I can't take you.
-You never take us.

01:50.318 --> 01:52.487
Well, I should,
especially with a heat wave like today.

01:52.570 --> 01:56.241
Until your dad is in full remission,
I'm gonna step up and take care of you.

01:56.324 --> 01:58.034
And by me, I mean Rusty.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.160
That doesn't work.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.871
I was okay with a one-day cancer thing,

02:01.955 --> 02:04.791
but every day
having a stranger in my space? No!

02:05.875 --> 02:07.460
-I prefer to walk.
-I don't!

02:07.544 --> 02:09.254
Me neither. I'm cutting down on my cardio.

02:09.337 --> 02:11.673
We're walking.

02:11.756 --> 02:13.424
<i>Something's off with Rusty.</i>

02:13.508 --> 02:15.468
Is he just a first-rate clinger,
or do you think

02:15.552 --> 02:17.762
he's inserting himself
to take over our lives?

02:17.846 --> 02:19.722
-What's his angle?
-Employment?

02:19.806 --> 02:22.517
Well, I did some digging,
or rather scratching,

02:22.600 --> 02:24.561
'cause the info well is not deep.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.521
He's new at school.
He's a junior transfer.

02:26.604 --> 02:29.315
And he has no social media,
which means he's either a psychopath

02:29.399 --> 02:30.400
or better than all of us.

02:30.483 --> 02:33.653
-Yeah, there really is no in-between.
-My vote is psychopath. Stranger danger.

02:33.736 --> 02:36.990
Is he a stranger?
I feel like I've met him before.

02:37.073 --> 02:38.700
Me too. Like, maybe he's been in my home.

02:38.783 --> 02:40.952
No, it was my home.

02:41.035 --> 02:44.080
Yesterday and today.
Anyway, he's not giving me a ride.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.874
I'd let him give me one.

02:45.957 --> 02:49.794
Um, does that mean you want a ride?

02:49.878 --> 02:52.463
No! We're not getting in now or ever.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.507
You can perv patrol beside us
all you want,

02:54.591 --> 02:57.177
but it's gonna be your loss
when you run out of gas.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.597
-Last call.
-Just go!

03:01.472 --> 03:02.599
Without us.

03:02.682 --> 03:03.808
Okay.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.939
Hey, Cinnamon and I like
a lot of the same bands.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.399
Makes sense. We share a moon sign.

03:11.983 --> 03:17.113
Oh, I have an idea. We should find out
what show Cinnamon's going to next and go.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.407
-And bring the box.
-Why would we bring the box?

03:19.490 --> 03:22.660
Because in order to undo a curse,
you need the cursed object.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.204
Basic curse knowledge, dum-dum.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.955
Great, we have a plan.

03:26.039 --> 03:26.956
Yay!

03:27.999 --> 03:28.917
We have a problem.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.877
No, we're not talking
about our issues right now.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.046
I don't do taxing conversations
before 9:00 a.m.

03:33.129 --> 03:34.964
It's not about the scar
or scarring or whatever…

03:35.048 --> 03:36.007
Or whatever?

03:36.090 --> 03:38.551
It's something else of equal importance
that I'm stressing over.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.428
Now we're talking about
what I'm not ready to.

03:40.511 --> 03:42.013
-I didn't say anything!
-Didn't have to!

03:42.096 --> 03:43.806
You're telling me you're stressing.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.892
I can't talk about
our situation right now.

03:45.975 --> 03:48.478
Whatever you have to share, tell Ines.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.022
Tell me what? Cam's annoying?

03:51.105 --> 03:53.149
Yes, but it's not that.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.110
And I wouldn't normally confide in you,
because, as we both know, you're…

03:56.194 --> 03:58.029
Not trustworthy.

03:58.112 --> 03:59.572
But I need some help.

04:01.199 --> 04:04.786
I don't have the box,
and I don't know where it is.

04:04.869 --> 04:07.247
Whoa! Gloria is gonna be so mad.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.999
She has crazy upper body strength
from the bent arm hang,

04:10.083 --> 04:12.919
and when she pulls your hair out,
it never grows back.

04:13.002 --> 04:14.420
Ines, this is why--

04:14.504 --> 04:17.757
…why you shouldn't tell me.
But since I'm here, I'll try to help.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.425
When did you last see the box?

04:19.509 --> 04:21.261
Hm. Let me think.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.846
<i>We were all together in Gloria's room.</i>

04:23.930 --> 04:26.516
<i>And Gloria said,</i>
<i>"Losers, go home. Get sleep."</i>

04:26.599 --> 04:30.353
<i>"My dad has cancer, yada yada.</i>
<i>My sister is the best."</i>

04:30.436 --> 04:31.854
<i>"Take the box, dummy!"</i>

04:31.938 --> 04:34.274
Then pee, pee, pee. Piss, piss, piss.

04:34.357 --> 04:37.360
<i>I was brushing my teeth,</i>
<i>talking to her about my dad and dummies,</i>

04:37.443 --> 04:39.404
<i>and then I realized I'm still hungry.</i>

04:39.487 --> 04:41.489
<i>So I stopped brushing</i>
<i>and went into the kitchen.</i>

04:41.572 --> 04:44.575
<i>And I opened the freezer to look</i>
<i>for a snack, but everything was meh.</i>

04:44.659 --> 04:47.370
<i>So I had a banana,</i>
<i>which was not in the freezer.</i>

04:48.579 --> 04:51.082
<i>This banana is way too ripe.</i>

04:51.165 --> 04:52.625
<i>Ines, where's the box?</i>

04:54.210 --> 04:56.629
-No idea. I think you took it.
-But I didn't take it.

04:56.713 --> 05:00.300
Or did I?
And if I did, where did I put it?

05:00.383 --> 05:03.177
That's a problem and one
my sister's gonna wanna know about.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.721
You can't tell her.

05:06.055 --> 05:08.141
Ugh, I know what you're thinking.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.476
Blackmail!

05:11.269 --> 05:12.103
Are you single?

05:12.895 --> 05:13.730
Uh, yes.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.732
Ready to mingle?

05:17.191 --> 05:20.737
How's your hygiene? Do you manscape?
Okay, that might be too personal.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.489
-God, you really do look familiar.
-Happens a lot.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.491
Maybe we've traveled together
in another life.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.076
-Next question.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.414
No.

05:32.790 --> 05:35.168
-She just wants to see me suffer.
-What?

05:35.918 --> 05:40.715
Okay. So, how many fingers
do you think you'd like up your…

05:41.299 --> 05:43.676
in your… you know?

05:43.760 --> 05:45.386
No, I don't know.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.184
I'm gonna go.

05:51.267 --> 05:54.896
Go. Get out of here,
and stop harassing my friend.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.481
Um, I almost forgot.

05:56.564 --> 05:59.359
Here's your lucky pen. Your uncle said
you need it for your history test.

05:59.442 --> 06:02.445
Luck? I don't need luck.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.405
But I do need my pen.

06:06.240 --> 06:10.203
That's right. Keep going
right out of my sight and my life.

06:10.286 --> 06:11.287
Okay!

06:12.580 --> 06:15.458
-Do you know the band Basta la Muerte?
-Yeah. My sister loves them.

06:15.541 --> 06:18.169
But her boyfriend is high-key obsessed.
They never miss a show.

06:18.252 --> 06:19.754
Great. We can ride with them tonight.

06:19.837 --> 06:21.714
-Tonight?
-They're playing in Cypress Park.

06:21.798 --> 06:25.343
I saw on TikTok that Cinnamon's going.
Now your plan is in motion.

06:25.426 --> 06:26.469
Uh…

06:26.552 --> 06:30.014
Yay. Way to put this plan
on the fast track.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.057
Can you slow down?

06:31.140 --> 06:33.684
If I burn any more calories,
my thigh gap's gonna come back.

06:33.768 --> 06:34.894
Can you stop stressing?

06:34.977 --> 06:37.730
Okay, fine. Maybe I am a little stressed.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.108
Or a lot. If I had to rate it
on the anxiety scale,

06:40.191 --> 06:43.319
what is the number that comes
after dry mouth and heart palpitations

06:43.403 --> 06:44.904
but is right before diarrhea?

06:44.987 --> 06:46.364
-Seven.
-I'm an eight.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.116
-Is it about the ghost?
-No.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.867
Is it about what we talked about?

06:49.951 --> 06:54.080
Cam, you said one question,
so I'm not gonna ask you a second.

06:54.163 --> 06:58.167
I'm trying to respect your boundaries.
Unless you want me to disrespect you?

06:58.251 --> 06:59.710
Maybe a little.

06:59.794 --> 07:00.837
Or a lot.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.215
It's eating me up that I don't know
what I did or said that scarred you.

07:04.298 --> 07:06.926
Now that you mention it,
maybe I don't wanna talk about it.

07:07.009 --> 07:10.012
It's on the back burner, because
I can only handle one anxiety at a time.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.181
I lost the box.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.559
Like <i>the </i>box?

07:15.560 --> 07:16.894
Oh shit!

07:16.978 --> 07:18.980
Exactly. So, can you help me?

07:19.063 --> 07:21.023
When's the last time
you remember seeing it?

07:21.983 --> 07:23.901
<i>I remember Gloria told you</i>
<i>to take the box.</i>

07:23.985 --> 07:26.904
<i>And then she was like,</i>
<i>"Go home. I gotta take a whiz."</i>

07:26.988 --> 07:29.699
<i>We were gathering our stuff to leave,</i>
<i>and Ines came out of the kitchen</i>

07:29.782 --> 07:31.534
<i>and said something about a banana?</i>

07:31.617 --> 07:34.454
<i>Oh, oh, I remember. You had the box.</i>

07:38.833 --> 07:40.710
<i>I can't believe she called me "dummy."</i>

07:40.793 --> 07:42.462
<i>Man, I love Wheat Thins.</i>

07:43.087 --> 07:46.507
<i>Oh, wait, it wasn't the </i>box<i> box.</i>
<i>It was a Wheat Thins box.</i>

07:50.970 --> 07:52.638
Sorry. It'll turn up in a few days.

07:53.222 --> 07:54.640
I don't have a few days.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.184
Because the ghost might kill us?

07:56.267 --> 07:59.979
Yes. But more urgently,
that TikTok witch likes Basta la Muerte.

08:00.062 --> 08:03.024
-Oh, your sister loves that band.
-And they're playing tonight.

08:03.107 --> 08:05.485
-So she can give us a ride there.
-Yes.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.904
And that's why you need the box. Ah.

08:07.987 --> 08:12.533
Oh, Gloria is gonna be so mad.
Especially with that upper body strength.

08:12.617 --> 08:15.244
Ugh, I know, but that's not even
what I'm worried about.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.955
I just don't wanna disappoint her.
Gloria takes on so much.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.917
And right now, what's going on
with her dad, we need to lighten her load.

08:21.000 --> 08:21.918
Yeah, we do.

08:22.001 --> 08:25.338
Plus, Gloria never lets me
be the responsible one,

08:25.421 --> 08:27.632
and that bitch needs
to stop calling me "dummy."

08:34.388 --> 08:35.264
Nice BuJo.

08:35.348 --> 08:38.601
Can you stop creeping around here?
You're in my bubble.

08:39.310 --> 08:42.605
Wait, you know what a bullet journal is?

08:42.688 --> 08:44.857
-A BuJo?
-A bullet.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.026
I know there are apps,
but there's something satisfying

08:47.109 --> 08:49.028
about crossing an item off
your to-do list.

08:49.111 --> 08:51.322
The cross-off is half,
if not all, my motivation.

08:51.405 --> 08:54.033
Do you mind if I… Can I show you my…

08:54.617 --> 08:55.618
Whip it out.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.793
Rusty, I never pegged you
as a color coder.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.295
I feel like it gives the task
a little personality.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.005
Green is for anything money-related.

09:08.089 --> 09:10.091
You should try
ordering the bills by due date.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.136
Um…

09:14.971 --> 09:16.847
-What's blue for?
-Household stuff.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.975
And violet is for Tonio Tasks.

09:19.058 --> 09:20.393
-He picked the color.

09:21.102 --> 09:24.105
"Invoice Gloria." What's that?

09:24.188 --> 09:27.608
My last two invoices.
Tonio said to give 'em all to you.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.488
Hourly and gas?

09:32.572 --> 09:35.533
I'm not paying for gas.
You haven't even driven me.

09:35.616 --> 09:37.743
I may be responsible for a lot of things,

09:37.827 --> 09:40.454
but I am not responsible
for you or this bill.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.790
-Tonio!
-You scream?

09:42.873 --> 09:45.793
-I'm not paying these bills.
-Yeah, you are.

09:48.546 --> 09:52.133
Rusty, you seem very familiar.

09:52.633 --> 09:56.429
-Who do people say you look like?
-Me? People say I look like me.

09:56.512 --> 09:57.930
That must be it.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.807
Anyway, money is money.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.101
So just pay Rusty what you owe me.

10:02.184 --> 10:03.477
I never agreed to this.

10:03.561 --> 10:06.314
Plus, I need money tonight
to get into a backyard punk show.

10:06.397 --> 10:09.609
-I'm not driving you.
-Once again, I know. You don't have a car.

10:09.692 --> 10:13.112
I could drive you. Plus, those shows
can go off, and you might need a--

10:13.195 --> 10:15.573
A chaperone? No, thank you. I'm covered.

10:15.656 --> 10:19.035
My friend does spells,
so I don't need protection.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.703
And I don't need a ride.

10:20.786 --> 10:22.538
I already have one.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.582
<i>You need another ride. I'm not going.</i>

10:24.665 --> 10:27.877
Davina, I want you to go.
But if you don't wanna go, it's fine!

10:27.960 --> 10:28.961
I don't wanna go!

10:29.045 --> 10:31.505
Not because you don't want me to,
but because I don't want to!

10:31.589 --> 10:33.799
-Fine! Do what you want!
-I will!

10:33.883 --> 10:35.926
I don't need to see you
up in those hoes you hang with

10:36.010 --> 10:38.721
after you get all sweaty
jumping around in your lame pit.

10:46.103 --> 10:46.979
I'm out.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.528
-Oh no. That sucks.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.489
What are we gonna do
now that our ride is gone?

10:56.572 --> 10:59.158
Should we just disperse
and pick this up another day?

10:59.241 --> 11:00.951
Uh, yeah, I'm tired.

11:01.035 --> 11:04.455
I'm not. It's not even 9:30.
Let's ask Rusty to drive us.

11:04.538 --> 11:05.831
No, we're not calling him.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.668
Sorry, guys.
At least I did everything I could.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.629
I'm sorry I can't drive you.
Things are just too intense.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.547
It's cool. Everyone's leaving.

11:14.590 --> 11:17.218
Don't go.
Do you think I was too hard on him?

11:17.301 --> 11:18.427
-No.
-Yes.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.305
I think he really loves you
and just wants to dance with you tonight.

11:21.389 --> 11:22.682
I don't do the pit.

11:22.765 --> 11:26.268
And I don't wanna go
and watch him drink himself stupid.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.396
I made the right decision. I'm not going.

11:28.479 --> 11:31.732
You don't wanna give him any satisfaction
of what he's asking you to do.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.567
Great talk. Okay. Friends, bye.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.319
Wait.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.280
I just played right into his hands.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.826
He wants to drink with the boys
and rub on randoms.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.994
If I go, none of that happens,

11:44.078 --> 11:47.665
so I need to go,
'cause going ruins his night.

11:47.748 --> 11:52.294
Guys, this is what
a healthy, mature relationship looks like.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.755
Mm. Love you.

11:54.839 --> 11:58.384
You always put a mirror up to me
to see my best self. Mm.

11:59.301 --> 12:00.428
Meet me in the car.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.187
All right.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.481
I've got a night to ruin.
Peace be with ya.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.735
Demi, I have to give you credit.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.988
That double reverse psychology
you pulled with Davina was genius.

12:19.071 --> 12:22.491
Yeah. Double reverse psychology.
That's definitely what I was doing.

12:22.575 --> 12:26.912
Now all we need to do is find Cinnamon
so she can double reverse our curse.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.623
You know, I thought a punk show
would have more live music.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.917
They blew a fuse.
Should be back on soon.

12:32.710 --> 12:35.755
Hey! What are--
This is not an appropriate place for you.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.590
-What are you doing here?
-We told you.

12:37.673 --> 12:38.841
What are <i>you </i>doing?

12:39.425 --> 12:42.803
I'm selling Off-White Claws
to underage kids.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.138
Do you hear your hypocrisy?

12:45.222 --> 12:46.098
I try not to.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.851
-Cinnamon is live streaming.
<i>-Muah, my little Cinnabons.</i>

12:48.934 --> 12:53.439
<i>I'm here at another Basta la Muerte show,</i>
<i>and we're gonna get lit.</i>

12:53.522 --> 12:55.191
-She's gotta be in the house.
Let's go.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.400
Hold up.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.986
Before we go, I wanna take a moment.

12:59.069 --> 13:02.281
A moment to acknowledge Demi.
Demi, we owe you for getting us here.

13:02.364 --> 13:05.034
I'm impressed by how much
you took the lead on this.

13:05.117 --> 13:08.788
-Ah, it was a group effort.
-No. You found Cinnamon first.

13:08.871 --> 13:12.249
Then it was your idea to follow her
to the show, and you got us a ride.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.460
I mean, I did do all of that.

13:14.543 --> 13:16.295
So hand me the box.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.255
-Now?
-Yes, please.

13:20.966 --> 13:21.842
Okay.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.565
-Oh. Wow. Yeah.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.287
-Oh no!

13:50.371 --> 13:51.247
Ugh!

13:51.330 --> 13:52.581
I brought the wrong box.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.458
My mom was wrapping snacks
for a food drive--

13:54.542 --> 13:56.126
Demi, just stop.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.586
I know you don't have the box.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.004
-What?
-Yeah.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.842
<i>When I finished up in the bathroom,</i>
<i>you and Cam had already left,</i>

14:02.925 --> 14:05.636
<i>but when I got there,</i>
<i>what, to my wandering eyes, should appear?</i>

14:05.719 --> 14:06.929
Demi forgot the box.

14:07.888 --> 14:10.015
-You knew she had the box, didn't you?
-Hm.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.810
Demi forgot the box.

14:14.728 --> 14:16.397
You know what would be fun?

14:17.147 --> 14:18.107
Huh…

14:20.109 --> 14:23.404
So you just let me torture myself
for the past two days?

14:23.487 --> 14:25.990
You need to be more responsible.

14:26.073 --> 14:28.158
Not everything
can just fall on my shoulders.

14:28.909 --> 14:29.743
Okay.

14:30.619 --> 14:32.788
Why are you not upset? Be mad.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.082
No, you don't get to control my reactions.

14:35.165 --> 14:38.502
You know, I'm actually gonna side
with Gloria on this one.

14:38.586 --> 14:41.505
Your recent lack of reactions
for other things is a little offensive.

14:41.589 --> 14:44.008
You said no follow-up.
I'm following your direction.

14:44.091 --> 14:45.718
Always a follower. Never a leader.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.679
-What are you two talking about?
-Nothing!

14:49.471 --> 14:51.265
Let's just go find
this goddamn witch bitch!

14:51.348 --> 14:52.933
See? That's a better reaction.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.235
Sorry, it's my day off.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.529
But we didn't say anything.

15:05.613 --> 15:08.866
Listen, I really appreciate my fans,
but not tonight.

15:08.949 --> 15:13.037
Tonight, I just wanna smoke my face off
and leave all my drama in the pit.

15:15.539 --> 15:16.624
I love Wheat Thins.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.128
A taste for a taste?

15:23.172 --> 15:24.173
Deal.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.887
-I brought the right box after all.
-Right, how can I help?

15:30.638 --> 15:34.516
So we bought this cursed box,
and now we're cursed because of it--

15:34.600 --> 15:36.310
Sorry, I don't do curses.

15:36.393 --> 15:37.353
Please.

15:37.436 --> 15:40.230
It's not that I won't. I literally can't.

15:41.523 --> 15:42.441
I don't do curses.

15:42.524 --> 15:45.778
Listen, I don't care
if you don't do curses.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.697
You must be able to give us something.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.075
Well, I do sense a dark energy around you.

15:51.575 --> 15:52.534
That's just Ines.

15:53.535 --> 15:55.245
No, not her.

15:56.038 --> 15:56.872
All of you.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.626
Wait, I'm getting a message.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.973
Your problem is that you are trying

16:14.056 --> 16:15.683
to fix something that is broken.

16:15.766 --> 16:20.270
But to solve your problem,
something must be broken to be fixed.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.441
Fortune favors the bold.

16:26.276 --> 16:28.737
Oh, no. No, thank you. I-- Oh!

16:28.821 --> 16:32.157
Whatever you choose
is going to be the wrong choice.

16:32.241 --> 16:35.494
But ultimately,
you have to choose not to choose,

16:35.577 --> 16:38.163
and that will be the choice,

16:38.247 --> 16:40.541
and it will be right.

16:40.624 --> 16:43.127
Uh, wait. So what's the right choice?

16:43.210 --> 16:44.253
Correct.

16:54.513 --> 16:55.347
What?

16:56.724 --> 16:58.308
-What?
-Oh, I'm done.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.145
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

17:01.228 --> 17:03.188
-What a waste of time.
-Wait!

17:08.027 --> 17:08.861
No.

17:16.285 --> 17:19.163
The hug. What do you think it means?

17:19.246 --> 17:22.249
It means this plan sucked. I gotta pee.

17:22.332 --> 17:25.461
Demi, find your sister. Let's go home.

17:30.632 --> 17:32.176
Oh. You.

17:32.676 --> 17:34.762
-I knew you were gonna be here.
-Okay?

17:34.845 --> 17:38.974
Something came to me after you left.
There's something I need to tell you.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.730
Did you wash your hands?

17:44.813 --> 17:47.983
One sister will be
the downfall of the other.

17:50.027 --> 17:50.861
Oh.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.197
Cool. Cool, cool.

17:53.989 --> 17:54.948
Thanks.

17:59.369 --> 18:00.496
Someone's gonna die.

18:08.837 --> 18:09.963
So, we going?

18:10.047 --> 18:12.382
My sister's making up with her boyfriend.

18:13.383 --> 18:17.221
-How long's that gonna take?
-Hours. It could take hours.

18:17.304 --> 18:18.764
-What about <i>Tío </i>Tonio?
-Nope.

18:18.847 --> 18:20.349
He's not leaving till he sells out.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.226
Apparently,
he's been killing it with the Claw.

18:22.309 --> 18:25.979
Yeah, it's gluten-free. There's no sugar.
There's no carbs. It's good for you.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.523
So, how are we gonna get home?

18:29.274 --> 18:32.277
What? Don't look at me.
This can't only be my problem to solve.

18:32.361 --> 18:35.489
No one said it was. Just seeing
if you have something to contribute.

18:35.572 --> 18:38.784
A contribution that maybe doesn't involve
teaching a condescending lesson.

18:38.867 --> 18:39.827
So now you're mad.

18:39.910 --> 18:43.330
Of course. I've been mad this whole time.
I didn't wanna give you the satisfaction.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.374
Oh, great. Your timing is impeccable.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.417
Oh, so, now my timing's off too?

18:47.501 --> 18:49.586
I know you probably don't want
actual feedback,

18:49.670 --> 18:53.173
but, yes, this timing is terrible,
because right now I'm tired.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.675
And all I wanna do is go home.

18:54.758 --> 18:58.053
Exactly my point.
It always has to be about you.

18:58.137 --> 19:02.099
Fine, Demi. What do you want? Hm?
To scream at each other in public?

19:02.182 --> 19:03.016
No!

19:03.684 --> 19:04.852
Hold my box.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.062
I wanna kick your ass.

19:07.729 --> 19:08.814
Fight!

19:08.897 --> 19:11.650
-Seriously, Demi? I'm not gonna fight you.
-Why not?

19:12.359 --> 19:14.111
-You scared?
-Punch her in the tit!

19:14.194 --> 19:16.155
-Ines! Shut up!
-Oh!

19:16.238 --> 19:18.949
Oh, you bitch.
You're lucky I have inverted nipples.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.079
No!
This is not the place for violence!

19:24.163 --> 19:27.166
What are you talking about?
This is exactly the place for violence.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.127
The pit is about self-expression,
and it requires consent.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.921
Well, this is how I choose
to express myself. I consent.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.339
I also consent.

19:34.423 --> 19:37.009
-Yeah, let her do it!
-Come on, let 'em go.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.804
-Hey! Hey!
-Hey! Hey!

19:40.888 --> 19:42.556
Hey! Come on! Let's go!

19:48.562 --> 19:50.606
Hey! Hey! Let's cool down!

19:50.689 --> 19:52.566
Hey, you don't wanna do this!

19:52.649 --> 19:53.942
-Stop!
-It's consensual.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.989
-Hey, are you Trusty Rusty from that show?

19:59.072 --> 20:01.116
Dude! It <i>is</i> Trusty Rusty!

20:01.200 --> 20:02.951
Um, nope. Different Rusty.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.787
I'm not going down first.
I'm not gonna make this easy for you!

20:05.871 --> 20:08.081
-You never make anything easy!
-Come on. Use your words!

20:08.165 --> 20:09.958
Come on, Rusty. Sing the song!

20:12.836 --> 20:14.129
Sing it!

20:16.798 --> 20:18.342
Rusty!

20:27.768 --> 20:29.895
Rusty is Trusty Rusty!

20:29.978 --> 20:32.272
That was my favorite show
when I was, like, five.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.482
Me too! Look!

20:46.620 --> 20:49.456
Brought to you by Freeridge Textiles!

21:10.477 --> 21:12.729
Thought you said
you'd never get a ride from me.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.773
-Desperate times.

21:16.149 --> 21:18.986
If you're a childhood star,
why are you working for my uncle?

21:20.279 --> 21:21.280
Uh, desperate times.

21:25.158 --> 21:26.910
So you spent all your show money.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.453
No, PBS doesn't pay shit.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.081
Okay, the money was in the dolls.

21:31.581 --> 21:33.250
-They made dolls?
-Yeah.

21:33.917 --> 21:35.335
The show was huge.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.589
-So where's your doll money?
-Long story, but it's gone.

21:40.674 --> 21:43.927
I need this job
to help take care of my grandma.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.564
-Hey.
-I'm sorry.

21:55.647 --> 21:56.982
<i>Nothing to apologize for.</i>

21:57.566 --> 22:00.986
I'm sorry. I need to stop being so judgy.

22:01.069 --> 22:02.612
I love you. Now go to bed.

22:02.696 --> 22:03.989
Don't tell me what to do.

22:05.073 --> 22:06.950
Or… do.

22:07.034 --> 22:09.911
<i>Sometimes it's nice</i>
<i>to have such a responsible friend.</i>

22:10.996 --> 22:13.415
Yeah, responsible friends are nice.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.709
-Good night.
-<i>Good night.</i>

22:31.099 --> 22:34.978
Your problem is you're trying
to fix something that is broken.

22:36.521 --> 22:40.942
But to solve your problem,
something must be broken to be fixed.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.996
"Marisol, Please come. I miss you."

22:53.080 --> 22:54.373
"Mariluna"?

22:55.874 --> 22:57.417
But the ghost is Marisol.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.796
Who the hell is Mariluna?

23:09.346 --> 23:11.223
<i>♪ Doctor said, "Feel better"</i>
