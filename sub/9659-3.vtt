PHIL: <i>Previously on
The Amazing Race...</i>

00:03.403 --> 00:05.923
<i>..11 teams raced
to Cartagena, Colombia.</i>

00:06.349 --> 00:08.909
<i>Darius and Cameron got
off to a rocky start...</i>

00:08.909 --> 00:10.379
Oh, we got the last flight.

00:10.379 --> 00:13.189
<i>..but once in Cartagena,
it was Marty and Hagan...</i>

00:13.189 --> 00:15.469
I can't find the right one!

00:15.469 --> 00:16.709
<i>..who sunk into last.</i>

00:16.709 --> 00:18.549
I never thought we'd be
at the bottom of the race.

00:18.549 --> 00:19.829
Does not feel good.

00:19.829 --> 00:23.469
<i>At a festive detour, Tyler
and Korey were all business.</i>

00:23.469 --> 00:24.669
Tyler, we're killing this!

00:24.669 --> 00:25.669
We're going good.

00:25.669 --> 00:27.749
<i>Passing leaders
Brodie and Kurt...</i>

00:27.749 --> 00:29.029
Oh, my God, is
this even possible?

00:29.029 --> 00:30.309
<i>..to win the leg.</i>

00:30.309 --> 00:32.549
You are team number one.

00:32.549 --> 00:33.869
Yeah!

00:33.869 --> 00:37.949
<i>Scott and Blair overcame a fishy
Speed Bump to stay in the race.</i>

00:37.949 --> 00:39.589
Agh! It bit me!

00:39.589 --> 00:42.549
<i>Marty and Hagan
cooked up a comeback...</i>

00:42.549 --> 00:44.029
Ah!

00:44.029 --> 00:45.634
<i>..but one final mistake...</i>

00:45.669 --> 00:47.954
What?! Hagan and
Marty are running.

00:47.989 --> 00:49.909
Yeah, I guess they left
their taxi over here.

00:49.909 --> 00:51.549
<i>..cost them dearly.</i>

00:51.549 --> 00:52.949
You have been
eliminated from the race.

00:52.949 --> 00:54.909
<i>10 teams remain.</i>

00:54.909 --> 00:56.714
<i>Who will be eliminated next?</i>

00:56.749 --> 00:59.789

some fish scales for lunch?

01:50.682 --> 01:52.282
Do what you want to
do. Just do it quickly.

01:52.282 --> 01:53.512
Like, it's a race.

01:53.512 --> 01:55.402
You want to ask if this
guy has phone, ask him.

01:55.402 --> 01:57.122
Not him.

01:57.122 --> 02:00.042
Matt, you're going to
over-think us to death.

02:00.042 --> 02:02.282
MATT: The last leg
was really difficult

02:02.282 --> 02:03.922
and we got a little
bit worked up.

02:03.922 --> 02:05.722
There's no-one over
here. -This guy...

02:05.722 --> 02:07.202
What are you
doing to us, babe?

02:07.202 --> 02:09.162
This guy. -My God,
you're so stupid.

02:09.162 --> 02:11.082
Being chaotic
isn't helping us.

02:11.082 --> 02:13.922
Sometimes you have to calm down
and hopefully we can learn that.

02:13.922 --> 02:15.842
Indecision is the thing
that kills the race.

02:15.842 --> 02:17.002
OK, calm down.

02:25.654 --> 02:27.574
"Make your way on
foot to Plaza San Diego

02:27.574 --> 02:29.094

02:29.094 --> 02:30.894
OK, Plaza San Diego,
make your way...

02:30.894 --> 02:32.934
KOREY: We've been
friends for eight years

02:32.934 --> 02:34.694
and it's only
ever been friends.

02:34.694 --> 02:36.014
Although...

02:36.014 --> 02:37.814
(LAUGHS)

02:37.814 --> 02:40.374
..Tyler did have a
crush on me in college.

02:40.374 --> 02:42.574
And then I met him and then
I realised nothing here.

02:42.574 --> 02:45.454
So you thought I was good-looking
but my personality sucks?

02:45.454 --> 02:46.734
Your words.

02:47.774 --> 02:48.739
It's hot out.

02:48.774 --> 02:50.694
You want me to splash you? -No.

02:50.694 --> 02:52.414
Plaza San Diego?

02:52.414 --> 02:55.094
Our biggest flaw
is going too fast.

02:55.094 --> 02:56.134
Plaza San Diego?

02:56.134 --> 02:57.299
He doesn't know,
he doesn't know.

02:57.334 --> 03:01.134
Also, I'm constantly talking
and just spitting out ideas.

03:01.134 --> 03:03.414
Hey, he doesn't know.
Kurt, he doesn't know!

03:03.414 --> 03:05.534
If he doesn't know...
Kurt! -We're good.

03:05.534 --> 03:08.774
Sometimes, it might be a little
annoying to Kurt but he's used

03:08.774 --> 03:11.014
to me talking all the time
so it's nothing new for him.

03:11.014 --> 03:12.214
Just straight and then left.

03:12.214 --> 03:14.014
No, this way, Brodie. Listen
to me on the directions.

03:17.134 --> 03:18.414
Just go, go, go, go!

03:18.414 --> 03:20.054
Beautiful.

03:20.054 --> 03:23.094
It's there in the hat,
in the hat, in the hat.

03:23.094 --> 03:25.694

"#Catacombs for

Wah! You got it?

03:40.094 --> 03:42.334
"Search for the catacombs

03:42.334 --> 03:44.814
Taxi, taxi, taxi, taxi!

03:44.814 --> 03:46.614
Kurt, you're scaring him.

03:46.614 --> 03:48.254
Plaza San Diego.

03:48.254 --> 03:50.134
ASHLEY: As a gamer we
are used to trying again

03:50.134 --> 03:51.654
if we don't get
quite the score.

03:51.654 --> 03:53.059
We're looking for
the first time around.

03:53.094 --> 03:55.574
You can't do that in the race.
You don't get a second go.

03:55.574 --> 03:57.414
In games, checkpoints
are like save points.

03:57.414 --> 03:59.734
Here, checkpoints are how you
get eliminated from the game.

03:59.734 --> 04:01.814
Let's go, this way.
-Burnie, please, your pace.

04:01.814 --> 04:03.574
Just keep it in check
from the beginning.

04:03.574 --> 04:05.454
Plaza San Diego?
-Yeah. Try left.

04:05.454 --> 04:06.574
Are you sure?

04:06.574 --> 04:08.099
Wait a second, don't just run.

04:08.134 --> 04:10.974
It's just too hot for us to
make any mistakes and run extra.

04:10.974 --> 04:12.694
Look at this.

04:12.694 --> 04:14.494
"Search the catacombs
for your next clue."

04:14.494 --> 04:15.694
OK, let's go.

04:21.086 --> 04:22.766
Is this it right here?

04:22.766 --> 04:23.966
Wow!

04:25.166 --> 04:26.786
I hear the trumpeter.

04:26.286 --> 04:28.406
Ready? Holy shoot!

04:28.406 --> 04:30.766
Korey, I don't want to
go down there, it's scary.

04:32.086 --> 04:33.846
Breathe. -Now we
take deep breaths?

04:33.846 --> 04:35.036
Oh, my God.

04:35.036 --> 04:37.036
You look to the right,
I'll look to the left.

04:37.036 --> 04:39.406
Look in every nook and cranny.

04:39.406 --> 04:40.806
I'm looking.

04:40.806 --> 04:42.201
Please, please, please.

04:42.236 --> 04:43.886
Oh, my God! -Do you think
this way or that way?

04:43.886 --> 04:45.476
Watch your foot,
it's super slippery.

04:45.476 --> 04:47.206
Here we go.

04:47.206 --> 04:49.286
"Detour. Tickets or Tejo."

04:49.286 --> 04:52.406
PHIL: <i>Colombia's reliable
and efficient bus system</i>

04:52.406 --> 04:55.406

04:55.406 --> 04:56.566
And here in Cartagena,

04:56.566 --> 04:59.356
it's the easiest and quickest
way to get around town.

04:59.356 --> 05:01.446
Right? OTHERS: Yeah!

05:01.446 --> 05:04.806
<i>After boarding a local bus, teams

<i>and earn their next clue.</i>

05:09.326 --> 05:10.766
Congratulations.

05:12.286 --> 05:14.646
Take a 3lb metal disc,

05:14.646 --> 05:16.446
some gunpowder

05:16.446 --> 05:18.286
and a clay target

05:18.286 --> 05:21.166
and you've got this
country's national sport.

05:23.886 --> 05:25.321
Tejo.

05:25.356 --> 05:26.371
<i>Throwing the disc,</i>

05:26.406 --> 05:30.326
<i>teams must hit three explosive
targets to receive their next clue.</i>

05:30.326 --> 05:31.966
Let's do Tejo. -Tejo.

05:31.966 --> 05:34.486
Muchas gracias, senor.

05:34.486 --> 05:36.366
I hear the trumpeter.
Is that him?

05:36.366 --> 05:37.686
Go, go, go!

05:37.686 --> 05:39.646
Don't get lost once we get in.
-This is my nightmare.

05:39.646 --> 05:41.406
Let's go this way.
-What are we looking for?

05:41.406 --> 05:42.726
Clue box. -Where is it?

05:42.726 --> 05:44.206
I don't know.

05:44.206 --> 05:45.926
Make sure we look
down each one, Brodie.

05:45.926 --> 05:47.326
Here it is, here it is.

05:47.326 --> 05:48.646
Tejo. -Yeah, Tejo.

05:48.646 --> 05:50.046
Taxi! Taxi!

05:50.046 --> 05:52.046
Whoo!
-They're right behind us.

05:57.146 --> 05:58.311
Plaza San Diego.

05:58.346 --> 05:59.546
Plaza San Diego. Let's go.

05:59.626 --> 06:00.826
Let's just follow them.

06:00.746 --> 06:02.026
Hopefully, they're right.

06:02.026 --> 06:04.226
We're just following the
maroon team right now.

06:04.226 --> 06:06.666
Zach's definitely more in the
spotlight way more then I am.

06:06.666 --> 06:09.426
And I'm always kind of
thrown in the background.

06:09.426 --> 06:10.906
Will you open this for me?

06:14.746 --> 06:15.831
Thanks.

06:15.866 --> 06:18.366
So I think the race is
more of a time for us

06:18.546 --> 06:20.866
to be in the spotlight
together as a team.

06:20.866 --> 06:24.106
We're trying to catch
up with the clever girls.

06:24.106 --> 06:25.666
Just speed walk.

06:25.666 --> 06:27.311
It'll look better
on camera anyways.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.106
Keep a steady jog, it's
going to be a good little run.

06:29.106 --> 06:30.906
Just do a steady
jog and I'll be good.

06:30.906 --> 06:32.506
Hold on, Daddy.

06:32.506 --> 06:34.506
You want me to carry your pack
for you? That might help you.

06:34.506 --> 06:35.706
Can you? -Yeah.

06:37.106 --> 06:38.266
"You must toss it underhand."

06:38.266 --> 06:40.306
It's going to be like
cornhole. We've got this.

06:40.306 --> 06:43.466
Dude, their whole shtick
is hitting targets!

06:43.466 --> 06:44.866
I didn't even think of that.

06:44.866 --> 06:45.906
If we don't do well at this,

06:45.906 --> 06:48.306
I'm going to be probably be
getting a lot of Twitter hate.

06:48.306 --> 06:50.266
Alright here. Follow
them, follow them.

06:50.266 --> 06:52.626
Follow, follow,
follow! -OK, OK, OK.

06:52.626 --> 06:54.106
I don't think they know
where they're going.

06:54.106 --> 06:56.106
Tap him on the
shoulder and ask.

06:56.106 --> 06:58.066
Senor?

06:58.066 --> 07:00.066
Senor, do you know?

07:03.306 --> 07:05.146
Here it is. -Yay!

07:05.146 --> 07:06.506
Yes!

07:06.506 --> 07:07.991
Oh, what is this?

07:08.026 --> 07:10.546
Oh, we're watching.
One line, OK?

07:10.546 --> 07:12.186
Oh, dang, that's hard.

07:12.186 --> 07:13.426
So, we each have two.

07:13.426 --> 07:14.986
Let's go this middle one.

07:14.986 --> 07:16.186
Alright, here we go.

07:17.506 --> 07:18.586
Way too much.

07:18.586 --> 07:20.386
Soft.

07:20.386 --> 07:21.351
There you go.

07:21.386 --> 07:23.626
It's all about speed
once you get it.

07:23.626 --> 07:25.186
There is.

07:25.186 --> 07:26.346
Get in.

07:26.346 --> 07:27.426
Whoo!

07:27.426 --> 07:28.791
Let's go, baby! -That's one.

07:28.826 --> 07:30.866
That was ridiculous.
-Let's go, let's go.

07:32.466 --> 07:34.431
The catacombs.
-For your next clue.

07:34.466 --> 07:37.146
"Search the catacombs for your
next clue." -Castillo San Felipe.

07:37.146 --> 07:38.586
We're going to the catacombs.

07:39.906 --> 07:40.911
Go left.

07:40.946 --> 07:42.306
Hey, I've got a great idea.

07:43.426 --> 07:45.906
You're not claustrophobic?
Hey, look what I found.

07:45.906 --> 07:47.306
Oh, did you find it? -Yeah.

07:47.306 --> 07:48.306
Let's go.

07:48.306 --> 07:50.786
Up there. -I hear a trumpet.

07:51.826 --> 07:52.926
Let's go. I'll follow you.

07:53.026 --> 07:53.991
Keep those eyes peeled.

07:54.026 --> 07:56.066
OK, you check the left
caverns, I'll check the right.

07:56.066 --> 07:57.626
I think I grabbed,
like, a rat.

07:57.626 --> 07:58.706
Go, go, go.

07:58.706 --> 08:00.226
Stop it, Matt.
Don't "go-go-go" me.

08:00.226 --> 08:02.306
We're searching for
something, stop yelling.

08:02.306 --> 08:04.306
Oh, I found it. -Good job.

08:04.306 --> 08:05.626
Nice.

08:05.626 --> 08:06.911
I say we throw it.

08:06.946 --> 08:09.146
Let's try to get down before
any other teams start coming up.

08:10.706 --> 08:12.006
Yeah, Brodie.

08:12.146 --> 08:13.246
Hit it, nail it.

08:13.306 --> 08:14.346
Ooh, just short.

08:14.346 --> 08:15.426
Come on, Kurt.

08:15.426 --> 08:18.746
We essentially have to throw these
rocks into this little bullseye

08:18.746 --> 08:21.546
and it explodes if you get it
in, so it's made a really loud...

08:21.546 --> 08:23.346
Ah! Oh! No way!

08:23.346 --> 08:26.226
Let's go, baby!
Let's go. Vamos!

08:26.226 --> 08:27.906
We've gotten two. We need
one more and we're good.

08:27.906 --> 08:29.986
OK, OK, OK.

08:29.986 --> 08:31.026
Get it this time, baby.

08:33.385 --> 08:35.631
(BOTH CHEER)

08:35.666 --> 08:38.546
I told you! I told
you! -That was sick!

08:38.546 --> 08:41.106
Gracias, senor.
Muchas gracias.

08:41.106 --> 08:43.385
"Make your way to

to get right in the middle.

Just good couple

09:02.466 --> 09:04.176
TYLER: We went
to Michigan State

09:04.176 --> 09:06.426
and we spent some
Sunday mornings

09:06.426 --> 09:07.586
playing cornhole.

09:07.586 --> 09:09.866
Except this was
with rocks and bombs.

09:09.866 --> 09:11.866
So similar, a
little different.

09:12.936 --> 09:14.466
Oh, sugar fudge.

09:15.706 --> 09:18.296
We're the last team to lead today
but we're still feeling pretty good.

09:18.296 --> 09:19.936
Hopefully we can
make a big comeback.

09:19.936 --> 09:21.056
Plaza San Diego?

09:21.056 --> 09:23.266
Being able to spend all
this time together is nice.

09:23.266 --> 09:25.146
We want to go as far
as the race can take us.

09:25.146 --> 09:26.626
Darius, slow down.

09:27.906 --> 09:29.546
We need just three,
we're going to get three.

09:29.546 --> 09:30.786
Blow it up, Kore.

09:30.786 --> 09:32.146
Oh, my Go...

09:32.146 --> 09:33.786
(LAUGHS)

09:33.786 --> 09:36.176
Bam! That freaked me out!

09:36.176 --> 09:39.706
I jump at any type
of... Like, anything.

09:39.706 --> 09:40.826
We got this.

09:40.826 --> 09:43.176
Ah! (LAUGHS)

09:43.176 --> 09:44.471
He doesn't just jump.

09:44.506 --> 09:47.166
He jumps and screams
for no reason.

09:46.466 --> 09:49.826
I can't handle
that. It was a bomb!

09:49.826 --> 09:51.146
We were safe.

09:51.146 --> 09:52.506
Got two down, one to go.

09:52.506 --> 09:53.866
Come on, Kore.

09:58.346 --> 09:59.666
Yeah! Gracias.

09:59.506 --> 10:00.986
Museo Naval?

10:02.106 --> 10:04.586
We've got to get three, babe.
-There you go. Get three bullseyes.

10:04.586 --> 10:05.826
Oh, so close.

10:07.906 --> 10:09.591
(CLANG!) Oops!

10:09.626 --> 10:10.866
Don't sweat it.
-You got this, babe.

10:10.866 --> 10:12.546
It's just like cornhole.

10:15.176 --> 10:16.511
Got it.

10:16.546 --> 10:17.986
Nailed it, OK. (LAUGHS)

10:19.706 --> 10:21.346
I think I got it again. Oh!

10:21.346 --> 10:22.546
Come on!

10:22.546 --> 10:24.106
Look at you! You show-off.

10:24.106 --> 10:25.296
I rimmed out!

10:26.426 --> 10:28.466
"Search for the #catacombs
for your next clue."

10:28.466 --> 10:30.226
Oh good, let's make
all that time up.

10:31.666 --> 10:33.551
Search the catacombs.

10:33.586 --> 10:37.026
Another cave. Are you
kidding me with this?!

10:37.026 --> 10:39.936
I am so claustrophobic.

10:39.936 --> 10:43.146
I really hate tight spaces.

10:43.146 --> 10:44.226
You've got this.

10:44.226 --> 10:46.026
I hear the trumpeter.
Do you hear him?

10:45.706 --> 10:47.826
There he is. He's
up there. Nice hat.

10:47.826 --> 10:49.466
Scary.

10:49.466 --> 10:51.426
We're going to
go down. -Careful.

10:51.426 --> 10:52.706
Oh, scary!

10:52.706 --> 10:54.191
Come on, baby, you
know you hate caves.

10:54.226 --> 10:55.866
You're doing awesome. Why
don't you get the clue?

10:55.866 --> 10:57.626
Let's do Ticket. OK,
we're doing Ticket.

10:57.626 --> 10:59.546
Oh, this way.
This way. Come on.

10:59.546 --> 11:01.546
We have to get in here?

11:01.546 --> 11:03.546
Oh, I'm so claustrophobic.

11:05.586 --> 11:07.106
I feel light-headed. -It's OK.

11:07.106 --> 11:09.066
No more underground!

11:10.546 --> 11:12.151
(HEART BEATING)

11:12.186 --> 11:14.431
Oh, my God, Jess,
I'm so afraid.

11:14.466 --> 11:16.786
I don't how we get
to where we're going.

11:16.786 --> 11:19.066
OK, OK.

11:19.066 --> 11:22.026
Oh, my gosh. Anxiety attack.

11:22.026 --> 11:24.146
Were going down. Be
careful, it's kind of steep.

11:24.146 --> 11:26.906
Oh, more caves.

11:26.906 --> 11:28.386
Oh, my gosh.

11:28.386 --> 11:30.026
(SOBS)

11:30.026 --> 11:32.106
I'm getting really claustrophobic.
Just keep breathing.

11:39.703 --> 11:41.223
Right here. I've got
the clue box here.

11:41.223 --> 11:42.503
Hurry, hurry.

11:42.503 --> 11:43.623
Good job. (SOBS)

11:43.623 --> 11:45.183
Breathe slow. Slow
down. -OK, I'm OK.

11:45.183 --> 11:47.223
Slow, slow.

11:47.223 --> 11:50.063
Anything to get us out of
here. I'll do whatever you want.

11:50.063 --> 11:52.183
I'll cut off my left arm if
that's what you want me to do.

11:52.183 --> 11:53.983
Gracias, gracias.

11:53.983 --> 11:56.023
Thank the Lord
Jesus for sunshine.

11:56.023 --> 11:57.823
What are we looking
for? -I don't know.

11:57.823 --> 11:59.583
Right here.

11:59.583 --> 12:01.268
We are choosing Tejo.

12:01.303 --> 12:03.028
Reading that clue down
there was just hell.

12:03.063 --> 12:06.223
That was even worse than the
cave, and that's saying something.

12:06.223 --> 12:07.343
This is going to
be fun, though.

12:07.343 --> 12:08.423
We're going to
get to interact.

12:08.423 --> 12:10.503
It's going to be so fun and
we'll get to smile and laugh.

12:10.503 --> 12:12.063
The name of the
game was catch-up.

12:12.063 --> 12:15.543
We don't know where anybody
else is, so all engines ahead.

12:15.543 --> 12:17.103
Catching up is what we do.

12:18.983 --> 12:20.388
Trumpeter, trumpeter.

12:20.423 --> 12:21.668
Are you sure the
trumpeter's up here?

12:21.703 --> 12:23.383
Right there. You see
him? -Oh, they're coming.

12:23.383 --> 12:24.783
Come on, baby, you got it.

12:26.183 --> 12:28.148
It's right here, guys.
You got this, Sheri.

12:28.183 --> 12:30.903
I can't believe I had to go in a
cave twice. -We're doing Tickets.

12:30.903 --> 12:32.183
We're doing really good.

12:32.183 --> 12:33.423
I say Tejo. Let's do it.

12:33.423 --> 12:35.343
We're hoping that we
picked the right one.

12:34.943 --> 12:37.263
I'll put on a show.
I'll twerk, I don't care.

12:40.183 --> 12:41.703
That's not going to
make it. You're up, babe.

12:43.303 --> 12:44.268
Yeah! -Yes!

12:44.303 --> 12:45.783
Great job, baby!

12:47.023 --> 12:48.263
Let's see that pop.

12:48.263 --> 12:49.743
You did it!

12:49.743 --> 12:51.223
That was so incredible!

12:51.223 --> 12:52.703
I love you so much.

12:52.703 --> 12:54.388
That was actually
a lot of fun.

12:54.423 --> 12:55.783
Nobody else is here.
Is that good or bad?

12:55.783 --> 12:56.823
It's probably bad.

12:56.823 --> 12:59.263
We can do this, baby.
Let's make this baby pop.

13:01.983 --> 13:04.383
Throw it like this, with
the flat, I think. -Shh!

13:06.343 --> 13:08.343
Put your toe right on the line.
-Babe, don't tell me what to do.

13:08.343 --> 13:09.463
Play your game.

13:09.463 --> 13:11.463
OK, there's some
bus stuff over here.

13:11.463 --> 13:12.983
Babe, it's over here. -OK.

13:12.983 --> 13:14.743
Hola. -Hello.

13:14.743 --> 13:16.668
I am the bus supervisor.

13:16.703 --> 13:19.788
OK, today, you will
be the bus attendant.

13:19.823 --> 13:23.103
RACHEL: For the Tickets Detour
we had to get people on the bus

13:23.103 --> 13:26.143
and then collect their
fair until we got 20,000.

13:26.143 --> 13:27.463
20,000 pesos.

13:27.463 --> 13:31.743
After the person sits down,
they will pay 1,800 pesos.

13:31.743 --> 13:33.303
Per person? -Yeah.

13:33.303 --> 13:36.703
When we get the full
amount, we come back.

13:36.703 --> 13:38.503
Remember the bus destination.

13:38.503 --> 13:41.703
Zaragocilla Hospital,
Calamares and Campestre.

13:41.703 --> 13:43.863
This is your bus. -OK.

13:43.863 --> 13:45.663
OK, here we go riding
the bus. -Good luck.

13:46.823 --> 13:48.503
Oh, wow, we are going
down some back roads here.

13:48.503 --> 13:50.743
This is crazy. How
does the bus even fit?

13:50.743 --> 13:52.423
Hola, hola! Hi.

13:52.423 --> 13:54.823
It was really fun because we
got to really immerse ourselves

13:54.823 --> 13:56.103
in some of the culture.

13:56.103 --> 13:57.223
Race me.

13:57.223 --> 13:59.343
Zaragocilla. -Zaragocilla?

13:59.343 --> 14:00.983
Whoa!

14:00.983 --> 14:03.583
Oh. Zaragocilla? Zaragocilla.

14:03.583 --> 14:05.183
Calamares.

14:05.183 --> 14:06.943
Campestre.
-Add a 'por favor'.

14:06.943 --> 14:08.303
Add a por favor! -No.

14:08.303 --> 14:10.503
Oh! (LAUGHS)

14:10.503 --> 14:12.348
I want to get out and just go.

14:12.383 --> 14:14.383
Cuantos kilometros,
senor? -500 metros.

14:14.383 --> 14:15.703
500 metres.

14:15.703 --> 14:17.903
Let's go. Gracias.
Get in, get out.

14:17.903 --> 14:19.263
Let's take our time.

14:19.263 --> 14:21.463
Slow and methodical. Make
sure you don't miss it.

14:25.103 --> 14:26.643
Right here, right here!

14:26.223 --> 14:28.183
Alright, here it is.

14:28.183 --> 14:30.023
"Roadblock. Who's
left holding the bag?"

14:30.023 --> 14:33.943
The indigenous people of
Latin America have been making

14:33.943 --> 14:38.903
beautiful mochila bags like these
for as long as people can remember.

14:38.903 --> 14:41.623
<i>One team member
must choose a mochila</i>

14:41.623 --> 14:45.423
<i>and then search the old city to find
two more bags by the same designer.</i>

14:45.423 --> 14:49.423
<i>Once they've found their matches,
they'll receive their next clue.</i>

14:49.423 --> 14:51.583
My gut feels, it
tells me you. -OK.

14:51.583 --> 14:53.343
Alright, you're doing it.

14:54.863 --> 14:57.543
Choose one of the
vendor's custom mochilas.

14:57.543 --> 14:59.343
I'm taking this
one. -You got it.

14:59.343 --> 15:02.263
Alright, "Two mochilas
by the same designer..."

15:02.263 --> 15:03.463
Slow and steady.

15:03.463 --> 15:06.343
It's going to be running so
fast in between, slow and steady.

15:06.343 --> 15:09.223
We've got to find something that
matches this designer right here.

15:12.463 --> 15:13.663
Disenos de Emelina.

15:14.663 --> 15:15.703
Oh, my gosh.

15:18.903 --> 15:20.183
Nothing here matches.

15:21.583 --> 15:24.228
OK, got to find
other marked vendors

15:24.263 --> 15:27.748
between Plaza Santa Teresa and
Plaza Santo Domingo. (SIGHS)

15:27.783 --> 15:30.623
KURT: Basically what I needed to
do was run around the walled city

15:30.623 --> 15:34.263
and find a vendor that had that same
handbag that matched the designer.

15:35.063 --> 15:37.903
So I had to stop and ask couple of
people directions just to make sure

15:37.903 --> 15:39.063
that I was in the
right vicinity...

15:39.063 --> 15:40.743
Donde esta la
Puerta del Reloj?

15:40.743 --> 15:42.103
Aqui?

15:42.103 --> 15:43.188
..so the ability
to speak Spanish

15:43.223 --> 15:45.143
was a definite,
definite positive for me.

15:45.143 --> 15:47.183
Sabe donde esta la
Puerta del Reloj?

15:48.223 --> 15:49.423
You got it, baby.

15:49.423 --> 15:51.743
Whoo!

15:51.743 --> 15:53.263
Yah!

15:53.263 --> 15:55.583
Come on, come
on. You can do it.

15:55.583 --> 15:56.823
Too hard.

15:58.263 --> 15:59.503
Yes!

16:02.463 --> 16:04.748
Yes? -Whoo!

16:04.783 --> 16:06.223
Alright, let's go.

16:07.383 --> 16:08.508
Trumpet.

16:08.543 --> 16:10.383
Oh, man. You hit your head?

16:10.383 --> 16:11.863
We're choosing Tejo.

16:11.863 --> 16:13.063
Tight taxi.

16:13.063 --> 16:14.668
I hit my head again.

16:14.703 --> 16:16.943
Were hoping that other
teams took that bus detour.

16:19.863 --> 16:21.303
Hasta luego! Gracias.

16:21.303 --> 16:22.743
Hola!

16:22.743 --> 16:25.943
The bus supervisor gave us a bag
of change and some directions.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.463
Here is your bag. -OK.

16:28.583 --> 16:30.343
Hola! -Whoo!

16:30.263 --> 16:32.103
Whoo-hoo!

16:32.103 --> 16:35.343
Joslyn, this is real life!

16:35.343 --> 16:37.903
What is going on?

16:37.903 --> 16:39.463
Hola!

16:39.463 --> 16:40.903
Oh, my God, tree.

16:40.903 --> 16:42.343
BOTH: Argh!

16:44.743 --> 16:47.748
Whoo!

16:47.783 --> 16:49.263
We have no idea where
the other teams are

16:49.263 --> 16:50.543
but we're having a great time.

16:50.543 --> 16:51.983
We're doing great.

16:51.983 --> 16:53.703
Good luck.

16:53.703 --> 16:55.543
Hola!

16:55.543 --> 16:56.983
Hey, guys. Hola.

16:56.983 --> 16:58.263
Whoo!

16:58.263 --> 16:59.823
Go over here.

17:02.223 --> 17:03.348
Pfft!

17:03.383 --> 17:05.502
This is hilarious, I know.

17:06.983 --> 17:09.502
OK, Don't worry about it,
it's going to take us a couple.

17:11.343 --> 17:12.923
Broke a nail on that one.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.502
Es el mismo aqui, no?

17:18.863 --> 17:19.828
Esta?

17:19.863 --> 17:21.823
Si, si. Gracias, senora.

17:21.823 --> 17:23.012
Muchas gracias.

17:25.012 --> 17:27.117
So it's the same designer.

17:26.343 --> 17:29.223
Gracias. Muchas gracias.

17:29.223 --> 17:31.143
OK, I need to find
one more mochila.

17:32.503 --> 17:33.638
Roadblock.

17:33.743 --> 17:34.738
I'll do it.

17:34.773 --> 17:37.533
"Choose of the vendor's
custom mochilas."

17:37.533 --> 17:39.423
OK, green.

17:39.423 --> 17:40.773
Santo Domingo?

17:40.773 --> 17:43.503
No! (SPEAKS SPANISH)

17:43.503 --> 17:46.583
Muralla y El Reloj. -OK.

17:46.583 --> 17:48.063
Y que es esto? La catedral?

17:48.063 --> 17:50.983
Come on. Uh!

17:50.983 --> 17:52.383
Where do I go?

17:52.383 --> 17:54.503
We just hit rush-hour
traffic, babe.

17:54.503 --> 17:56.463
Rache, we just hit
rush-hour traffic.

17:56.463 --> 17:57.503
This is really bad.

17:57.503 --> 17:58.773
Ugh! -It's crazy.

17:58.773 --> 18:00.823
What's up? How are you?

18:00.823 --> 18:01.823
Oh, boy.

18:01.823 --> 18:04.463
Zaragocilla Hospital!

18:04.463 --> 18:06.423
Calamares, Campestre.

18:06.423 --> 18:07.788
I don't think people trust us.

18:07.823 --> 18:09.903
Come ride, come
ride a little bit.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.983
Zaragocilla
Hospital. Campestre.

18:11.983 --> 18:14.583
Si, come on. Come,
come. Help us.

18:14.583 --> 18:18.293
They think it looks weird that we're
hanging out the door, so I hope...

18:18.293 --> 18:19.503
Si.

18:19.503 --> 18:21.143
Para, para.

18:22.533 --> 18:24.588
Si, si. Come. Come help us.

18:24.623 --> 18:26.863
1,800. We need
1,800. Gracias, senor.

18:26.863 --> 18:29.533
I saw your videos on YouTube.

18:29.533 --> 18:31.063
Gracias.

18:32.103 --> 18:33.983
We have fans in
Colombia, that's crazy.

18:33.983 --> 18:35.823
On the streets of Colombia.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.823
Zaragocilla Hospital.

18:38.823 --> 18:40.343
Get on the bus, ride the bus.

18:40.343 --> 18:42.183
Zaragocilla Hospital.

18:42.183 --> 18:44.143
Come on, come on!

18:48.223 --> 18:50.148
Si! Oh, Daddy, we got one.

18:50.183 --> 18:52.228
I was able to coax
some people on.

18:52.263 --> 18:54.383
I said, "Beso for peso,"
and they all came on.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.293
We got another one! Oh,
my God, we got another one!

18:56.293 --> 18:57.773
Whoo-hoo!

18:57.773 --> 18:58.863
Yeah!

18:58.863 --> 19:01.383
Oh, my God, yes.

19:01.383 --> 19:02.943
Yes! Si, si.

19:02.943 --> 19:04.773
Yeah! You want
to come? Come on.

19:04.773 --> 19:06.623
Yeah!

19:06.623 --> 19:07.943
Vamanos.

19:07.943 --> 19:09.663
Yeah!

19:09.663 --> 19:11.013
No-one asked me for a beso.

19:11.013 --> 19:12.423
They gave dad the peso

19:12.423 --> 19:14.283
and then I think they
might have thought,

19:13.863 --> 19:16.143
"If I give you the
peso, do I get the beso?"

19:16.143 --> 19:18.343
Beso, beso!

19:19.423 --> 19:21.428
Yeah.

19:21.463 --> 19:23.703
But I blew some kisses
to a lot of people.

19:23.703 --> 19:26.309
That's as far as
that needed to go.

19:28.841 --> 19:29.921
This is kind of fun.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.081
Get ready for this.

19:34.271 --> 19:35.366
Yes!

19:35.401 --> 19:36.781
Yes, that's my girl!

19:36.921 --> 19:38.241
OK, one more, one more.

19:38.161 --> 19:39.561
Oh, someone's coming, Jess.

19:39.561 --> 19:41.361
It's Cole and Sheri. -Hey.

19:41.361 --> 19:43.721
The pressure's on now
we know someone's coming.

19:44.801 --> 19:45.801
This one's on it.

19:47.031 --> 19:48.366
Whoo!

19:48.401 --> 19:49.541
Yes. Good one.

19:49.601 --> 19:50.646
Thank you.

19:50.681 --> 19:52.206
Bye, guys. Hasta luego.

19:52.241 --> 19:54.641
Just got to pop
three combined.

19:56.511 --> 19:58.561
Whoo! First one.

20:00.031 --> 20:01.236
Oh. Lame.

20:01.271 --> 20:03.081
So bad at this.
I'm very sorry.

20:03.081 --> 20:05.511
Roadblock. OK.

20:05.511 --> 20:07.681
"Who's left holding
the bag?" I can do it.

20:07.681 --> 20:09.321
You can do it. -"Who's
left holding the bag?"

20:09.321 --> 20:11.081
Hola.

20:11.081 --> 20:12.741
Same designer?

20:12.681 --> 20:14.401
Same designer.

20:16.401 --> 20:18.271
Disenos de Eugenia.

20:18.271 --> 20:20.081
Oh, no.

20:20.081 --> 20:21.926
OK, gracias.

20:21.961 --> 20:23.541
It's not the same one.

20:23.721 --> 20:25.281
I'm looking for Eugenia.

20:25.121 --> 20:26.841
OK I'm looking for...

20:28.031 --> 20:29.921
..matching, this is a
little different though.

20:31.441 --> 20:32.921
By the same designer.

20:34.271 --> 20:35.976
This...

20:35.921 --> 20:37.681
Ah, OK, OK.

20:37.681 --> 20:38.751
I think this is a match.

20:38.751 --> 20:40.161
Hold it.

20:40.161 --> 20:41.921
"Who's left holding the bag?"

20:41.921 --> 20:43.031
OK, I'll do it.

20:43.031 --> 20:44.336
Come on, you got it.

20:44.271 --> 20:45.641
Doubtful that's it.

20:47.121 --> 20:48.161
No.

20:49.401 --> 20:50.681
This is hard.

20:54.121 --> 20:59.121
I don't see any
that match my bag.

20:59.121 --> 21:01.401
Am I doing something wrong?

21:04.161 --> 21:06.721
Shoot! There's a
tag inside here.

21:06.721 --> 21:08.441
Designed by Ana.

21:08.441 --> 21:10.031
That might be
what's going on here.

21:10.031 --> 21:11.561
Hola.

21:14.401 --> 21:15.566
Can I take this?

21:15.601 --> 21:18.161
OK. -Good. Bueno, one more bag.

21:18.161 --> 21:20.001
Ese ahi.

21:20.001 --> 21:21.441
Como este, por favor.

21:21.401 --> 21:22.881
Esta? -Si, senor.

21:25.721 --> 21:28.321
Muchas gracias,
muchas gracias.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.081
Este es el mismo...

21:30.081 --> 21:31.361
Emelina. Awesome.

21:32.681 --> 21:34.286
Muchas gracias, senor.

21:34.321 --> 21:35.646
Muchas gracias. Vaya con Dios.

21:35.681 --> 21:38.241
OK, let's go back,
let's get the clue.

21:39.401 --> 21:40.606
Eugenia...

21:40.641 --> 21:42.561
Can I take it? Gracias?

21:42.561 --> 21:43.681
Gracias.

21:43.681 --> 21:44.961
Got my third one.

21:44.961 --> 21:46.031
OK, OK.

21:47.751 --> 21:49.006
Yah! -That's two.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.601
I want to give you
a hug. -No, just go.

21:50.761 --> 21:52.126
I'm sweaty, I don't
want to hug you.

21:52.161 --> 21:54.161
Take your time, you got it.
You'll get this final one.

21:55.161 --> 21:57.241
Ooh, I thought I did
that there. -I know.

21:57.241 --> 21:59.161
You popped it, you
popped it midair.

22:01.121 --> 22:02.926
(BOTH CHEER)

22:02.961 --> 22:04.801
Yeah! We got it, let's go.

22:05.841 --> 22:07.641
Three by the same designer.

22:07.641 --> 22:08.801
(SIGHS)

22:10.041 --> 22:11.621
Muchas gracias!

22:12.001 --> 22:13.166
Thank you so much.

22:13.201 --> 22:14.841
"Make your way on foot
to the next Pit Stop.

22:14.841 --> 22:16.761
"Baluarte de Santiago,
the old city wall.

22:16.761 --> 22:19.001
"Warning, last team to be
checked in may be eliminated."

22:19.001 --> 22:20.801
Let's go. This
way to the wall.

22:20.801 --> 22:22.801
Hey, good luck. Good
luck. Good luck, guys.

22:23.801 --> 22:26.521
OK, I saw Tyler come
from this direction.

22:26.521 --> 22:29.281
Hey, Kurt, up
and to the right.

22:29.281 --> 22:32.841
Eugenia, Eugenia y...Eugenia.

22:34.201 --> 22:35.726
Perfecto? -Yes. -Ah!

22:35.761 --> 22:38.161
It's the old city wall.
-I think it's this way.

22:38.161 --> 22:40.041
I'm ready to run when you are.

22:41.041 --> 22:42.361
Come on, Kurt!

22:44.481 --> 22:46.281
Wow. That's my boy.

22:47.841 --> 22:48.886
How's that, Phil?

22:48.921 --> 22:51.681
Welcome to Baluarte
in Cartagena.

22:51.681 --> 22:53.361
Gracias. -Thank you so much.

22:53.361 --> 22:54.481
Gracias. -Muchas gracias.

22:54.481 --> 22:55.721
Brodie and Kurt...

22:55.721 --> 22:56.841
Yes, sir.

22:56.841 --> 22:58.441
..you have won this
leg of the race.

22:58.441 --> 22:59.481
You are team number one!

22:59.481 --> 23:02.681
(BOTH CHEER)

23:02.681 --> 23:05.121
You have won a trip
for two from Travelocity

23:05.121 --> 23:07.361
and you are going
to Mykonos in Greece.

23:07.361 --> 23:08.601
Yes! Score!

23:08.601 --> 23:10.166
Man, that's sick! -Greece!

23:10.201 --> 23:14.961
<i>During your five nights at the
Myconian Avaton in Platis Gialos,</i>

23:14.961 --> 23:18.161
<i>you'll take a tour
of Delos island,</i>

23:18.161 --> 23:22.881
<i>enjoy two spa treatments
and a VIP dinner for two.</i>

23:22.881 --> 23:24.681
That is mental! I'll take it.

23:24.681 --> 23:25.801
Perfect.

23:25.801 --> 23:28.161
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity

23:27.561 --> 23:30.521
and every leg is an
amazing experience.

23:30.521 --> 23:33.161
We want to keep
experiencing all that stuff.

23:35.441 --> 23:37.441
Tyler and Korey, you
are to number two.

23:37.441 --> 23:39.321
Congratulations.

23:39.321 --> 23:42.001
Did you expect
to do this well?

23:42.001 --> 23:44.401
We had dreamed we
would do this well.

23:44.401 --> 23:46.041
I knew Korey
could do this well.

23:46.041 --> 23:47.521
I just wanted to
keep up with him.

23:47.521 --> 23:50.281
Although every time you've done
the Roadblock, we've got in second.

23:50.281 --> 23:51.761
Every time I've
done it, we've won.

23:52.801 --> 23:54.561
It's true! -Rude.

23:55.641 --> 23:57.601
I think I've won something.

23:58.641 --> 24:00.141
You won America's heart.

24:00.281 --> 24:01.641
Hmm, that's what I won.

24:04.241 --> 24:05.286
How many do we need to hit?

24:05.321 --> 24:06.921
Blow the bullseye three
times. -Three times.

24:06.921 --> 24:08.281
I play this on the weekends.

24:09.881 --> 24:11.166
Oh!

24:11.201 --> 24:13.121
Be loose.

24:15.601 --> 24:17.006
Let's go. Whoo!

24:17.041 --> 24:19.001
Come ride, come
ride a little bit.

24:19.001 --> 24:20.641
Zaragocilla Hospital.

24:20.641 --> 24:22.561
Zaragocilla. Want
to come on the bus?

24:22.561 --> 24:24.401
I need 1,800 pesos.

24:24.401 --> 24:26.721
Come ride a little
bit. Gracias, gracias.

24:26.721 --> 24:27.881
How much do we have, Rache?

24:27.881 --> 24:30.041
Two, four, six...

24:30.041 --> 24:31.321
Gracias, senor.

24:31.321 --> 24:32.521
11,000.

24:34.321 --> 24:35.921
Para, para, para, para.

24:37.121 --> 24:40.241
Zaragocilla Hospital,
Calamares, Campestre.

24:40.241 --> 24:41.961
Yeah!

24:41.961 --> 24:43.286
Hola, bonita!

24:43.321 --> 24:44.846
Let me help you here.

24:44.881 --> 24:46.486
Which aisle would
you like to sit in?

24:46.521 --> 24:48.921
All of these seats have
been hand-washed by myself.

24:48.921 --> 24:50.441
Hola!

24:50.441 --> 24:52.366
I was so in the zone. -Mm-hm.

24:52.401 --> 24:54.446
I was selling
this bus to people.

24:54.481 --> 24:56.641
Erin, I feel like
this is our calling.

24:56.641 --> 25:00.401
I think I might just quit
my job and just run buses.

25:00.401 --> 25:02.001
Only if I can it
do with you, Joslyn.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.641
Only with you, baby.

25:03.641 --> 25:06.241
Only with you. -Only with you.

25:08.921 --> 25:10.761
Hola! Hola!

25:11.041 --> 25:12.641
Daddy, another.

25:12.601 --> 25:14.241
Zaragocilla.

25:14.241 --> 25:16.401
She was bringing
the money in so fast,

25:16.401 --> 25:17.961
I couldn't count the
money fast enough.

25:17.961 --> 25:20.481
Whoo! -Muchas gracias,
muchas gracias.

25:20.481 --> 25:22.041
You're so pretty.

25:22.041 --> 25:23.961
Magnifique. Daddy,
another one, another one.

25:23.961 --> 25:25.881
OK. Great. -Vamanos.

25:25.881 --> 25:28.401
Come on, they're so cute,
Daddy. Blow them a kiss.

25:28.401 --> 25:30.881
No, they don't want me to
blow them a kiss, Blair.

25:30.881 --> 25:32.921
All this money is
your kiss blowing.

25:34.801 --> 25:35.881
Oh.

25:39.201 --> 25:40.361
You might be better
at this than me.

25:40.361 --> 25:41.521
Can't hate the game.

25:42.641 --> 25:44.441
We can't hate the game, we
can hate the player though.

25:44.441 --> 25:45.841
With this game, I
don't know what to hate.

25:46.921 --> 25:48.741
We blew up one tejo.
We got two more to go.

25:49.121 --> 25:50.561
It took us a while
to get a stroke down.

25:52.521 --> 25:53.801
Let's go.

25:54.801 --> 25:56.566
Let's go, yes!

25:56.601 --> 25:58.041
Thank you, thank you.

25:58.041 --> 25:59.481
Alright, let's go.

25:59.481 --> 26:02.441
We are blazing
through this. Nice!

26:02.441 --> 26:06.761
BOTH: Hospital,
Calamares, Campestre.

26:06.761 --> 26:08.841
(BOTH WHOOP)

26:10.561 --> 26:13.601
This is one of the best
experiences of my whole life.

26:13.601 --> 26:15.121
OK, Joslyn, are we
done? I think we're good.

26:15.121 --> 26:16.641
Let me count it.

26:16.641 --> 26:17.841
OK, we're way over.

26:17.841 --> 26:19.241
O, let's go back. Gracias.

26:19.241 --> 26:21.441
Calamares.

26:21.441 --> 26:22.801
Campestre.

26:22.801 --> 26:25.361
Hola! Daddy, another.

26:25.361 --> 26:27.801
Thank you, thank
you. Muchas gracias.

26:27.801 --> 26:28.801
We're done.

26:28.801 --> 26:29.841
We're done, we're done!

26:29.841 --> 26:30.921
Para.

26:30.921 --> 26:32.366
Oh, my God. Para, para!

26:32.401 --> 26:33.801
Oh, my God. Gracias, gracias.

26:33.801 --> 26:35.721
Oh, er...

26:35.721 --> 26:37.161
..hug? Hug.

26:38.641 --> 26:41.006
Alright, let me do the math.

26:41.041 --> 26:42.901
I think we're doing,
I think we're done.

26:42.681 --> 26:44.761
Are you sure? Double-check,
count the money.

26:44.761 --> 26:47.921
I have two 10s and we needed
20 so I think we're way over.

26:47.921 --> 26:49.481
We got it, OK.
Gracias, senorita.

26:52.561 --> 26:54.121
Let's get a taxi on the
other side of the street.

26:54.121 --> 26:55.241
OK. It's crazy.

26:55.241 --> 26:57.721
I think this is
very dangerous!

26:57.721 --> 26:59.641
Taxi! Taxi!

26:59.641 --> 27:01.241
Gracias, gracias!

27:03.001 --> 27:05.541
Count the money. I
have two 10s right here.

27:05.521 --> 27:08.081
Oh, OK, those aren't
10s, babe. Those are ones.

27:08.081 --> 27:10.721
Oh, my goodness. You've
bean counting wrong.

27:10.721 --> 27:12.801
Two, four, six...

27:14.081 --> 27:15.606
11.

27:15.641 --> 27:17.206
12, 13, 14...

27:17.241 --> 27:19.761
Babe, we didn't do
enough. I'm so sorry, babe.

27:19.761 --> 27:21.441
What do we do?
-We have to go back...

27:21.441 --> 27:22.561
We have to...

27:22.561 --> 27:24.086
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

27:24.121 --> 27:26.201
The money is different
here. (BREATHES HEAVILY)

27:26.201 --> 27:28.161
Those aren't thousands. -Oh!

27:35.766 --> 27:37.606
I knew that was too
fast, it was too easy.

27:37.606 --> 27:38.926
I'm so sorry.

27:38.926 --> 27:40.246
We have to... -Get on
our bus and go back.

27:40.246 --> 27:41.886
Get on a bus, a new bus.

27:41.886 --> 27:43.286
Oh, my gosh.

27:43.286 --> 27:45.046
Oh, baby.

27:45.046 --> 27:46.211
This is not good.

27:46.246 --> 27:47.806
And you're the
CFO of our company.

27:47.806 --> 27:49.286
It was so fun!

27:49.286 --> 27:51.286
Hola!

27:51.286 --> 27:52.491
We have all our
money right here.

27:52.526 --> 27:55.726
Veinticuatro, veintiseis,
veintiocho... OK.

27:55.726 --> 27:56.966
It's more.

27:56.966 --> 27:58.851
Yeah! -Thank you!

27:58.886 --> 28:00.206
We can run it, there's
the purple team.

28:00.206 --> 28:02.166
Where is it? Back there?

28:02.166 --> 28:03.846
Keep going, keep going.

28:03.846 --> 28:05.846
How was it? -It was
wonderful, we had a ball.

28:05.846 --> 28:08.006
Wonderful. -You count.

28:08.006 --> 28:09.606
OK, the money is complete.

28:09.606 --> 28:11.126
Ah-ha-ha!

28:11.126 --> 28:13.486
Thank you, thank
you. Thank you.

28:13.486 --> 28:14.686
Darn.

28:14.686 --> 28:16.706
It was all my fault.
This is totally me.

28:16.366 --> 28:18.726
We need to go on
another bus. -Ah, OK.

28:18.726 --> 28:20.166
We're about 5,000 pesos short.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.126
I mean, we are
dead last right now.

28:22.126 --> 28:23.166
Here we go again.

28:24.726 --> 28:27.386
Oh, I think I got
it, I think I got it.

28:27.206 --> 28:30.046
Let's be smart.
Let's not go crazy.

28:31.286 --> 28:33.131
OK. I got 'em.

28:33.166 --> 28:35.966
Alright, three bags.

28:35.966 --> 28:38.246
Hola. It's OK?

28:38.246 --> 28:39.406
Sorry.

28:39.406 --> 28:40.486
Lo siento.

28:42.526 --> 28:43.806
Come on, designed by Ana.

28:43.806 --> 28:45.086
I know you're here.

28:46.486 --> 28:48.131
It looks like these.

28:48.166 --> 28:49.771
I really thought
it would be here.

28:49.806 --> 28:52.766
I think I have to go
a little bit further.

28:52.766 --> 28:54.406
I don't think it's here.

28:56.646 --> 28:57.966
Ah-ha-ha!

28:57.966 --> 28:59.446
Yes!

28:59.446 --> 29:01.246
"Warning, last team to
check in may be eliminated."

29:01.246 --> 29:02.566
Great.

29:02.566 --> 29:03.966
Come on, Dana.
You're good, babe.

29:03.966 --> 29:06.486
I've run, like, three miles.

29:06.486 --> 29:08.051
I just can't find
the second one.

29:08.086 --> 29:09.686
Ashley just finished.
You're doing good.

29:09.686 --> 29:11.286
Babe, don't talk
to me! -OK, OK.

29:11.286 --> 29:12.886
Go back into your own world.

29:12.886 --> 29:14.406
Let me live my
life. -Right, right.

29:17.366 --> 29:19.726
Burnie and Ashley, you
are team number three.

29:19.726 --> 29:21.326
Yeah!

29:24.046 --> 29:26.126
I don't think I've been here
yet. It's got to be here.

29:27.486 --> 29:28.731
Ana, come on, Ana.

29:28.766 --> 29:30.766
Yes! This is my second one.

29:30.766 --> 29:32.406
I found it.

29:32.406 --> 29:35.766
OK, we need to
tell Cole and Sheri.

29:35.766 --> 29:37.966
It's right here,
it's this one.

29:37.966 --> 29:39.651
You're doing it,
right? -I am, yeah.

29:39.686 --> 29:41.406
I'm left holding the bag.
-Cole's left holding...

29:41.366 --> 29:43.126
We'll just look down
each street as we pass it.

29:43.126 --> 29:44.126
I see one right there.

29:44.126 --> 29:45.806
Whoo!

29:47.006 --> 29:48.726
I got it. -Good job, good job.

29:50.046 --> 29:51.771
Gracias, senora.

29:51.806 --> 29:54.366
"Last team to check
in...may be eliminated"

29:54.366 --> 29:55.686
Or die.

29:55.686 --> 29:58.726
Campestre, Zaragocilla!

29:58.726 --> 30:01.046
Pesos. Oh, gracias, gracias.

30:01.046 --> 30:04.326
We are trying really hard to get
our last amount of money here.

30:04.326 --> 30:06.326
I'm starting to lose my
voice. This is really hard.

30:06.326 --> 30:08.366
Gracias, senoras.
Gracias, senoritas.

30:08.366 --> 30:09.846
Gracias.

30:09.846 --> 30:11.366
Hey. Yeah, we're doing good.

30:11.366 --> 30:13.006
Let's go back. -Taxi!

30:13.006 --> 30:14.406
Here we go.

30:14.406 --> 30:15.806
Come on, babe.

30:15.806 --> 30:18.206
Give us a little dance. Give
us a little dance, come on.

30:20.846 --> 30:22.251
MATT: The race
is a partnership

30:22.286 --> 30:25.091
and weed to make sure that
we're on the same page.

30:25.126 --> 30:27.606
DANA: Not only for the race but
for our relationship moving forward.

30:27.606 --> 30:30.446
We have to try and stay a
little calmer, communicate better

30:30.446 --> 30:32.446
and just make sure that we
remember to work together.

30:35.926 --> 30:37.926
Here's some bags - these
are marked? Yes, these are marked.

30:39.606 --> 30:42.366
I see one right
there. That's ours.

30:42.366 --> 30:44.286
This is ours.

30:44.286 --> 30:46.091
There's another one,
there's another one.

30:46.126 --> 30:48.046
There's got to be. Is
that it right there, Cole?

30:48.046 --> 30:49.606
You found yours...

30:49.606 --> 30:51.126
No, Cole. I'm going
to run with you, Cole.

30:51.126 --> 30:53.126
We're still ahead
of other people.

30:53.126 --> 30:55.006
Let's go to another one.

30:55.006 --> 30:57.446
JESSICA: Cole and I teamed
up because I trust him.

30:57.446 --> 31:01.326
I had all of my bags, Cole
just needed his last one

31:01.326 --> 31:04.046
so I was going to run around
with him all the way to the end...

31:04.046 --> 31:05.806
Oh, my God, nothing. Next.

31:05.806 --> 31:10.046
If you're not the last team...
If you want to be nice, be nice.

31:10.046 --> 31:12.286
Is this where we started?
Let's check it again.

31:12.286 --> 31:13.646
Is Cole with her?

31:13.646 --> 31:15.366
Yeah, they're together,
they're together.

31:15.366 --> 31:16.686
Good. Oh, that's so good.

31:16.686 --> 31:19.126
No. It's not it.

31:19.126 --> 31:21.166
Cole, this isn't it. Come on.

31:21.166 --> 31:23.326
How you doing? Are
y'all doing good?

31:23.326 --> 31:24.926
I have them, I'm just
trying to help Cole.

31:24.926 --> 31:26.206
Oh, you're so sweet.

31:26.206 --> 31:27.846
You guys go ahead.
You've done really good.

31:27.846 --> 31:29.606
Alright. Love you, Cole.

31:29.606 --> 31:31.806
It's OK, Cole. You can do it.

31:31.806 --> 31:33.886
Man, there can't
be many more left.

31:33.886 --> 31:36.006
Gracias, senorita.

31:36.006 --> 31:39.126
"The old city wall. Warning,
the last team may be eliminated."

31:39.126 --> 31:41.006
I ran for a while with him.

31:42.686 --> 31:43.931
OK, let's go.

31:43.966 --> 31:46.786
OK, sir, we did
it right this time.

31:46.486 --> 31:49.606
Diecisiete, dieciocho,
diecinueve...

31:49.606 --> 31:52.126
Twenty. -Whoo! -Finished.

31:52.126 --> 31:54.486
Gracias! -Arriba!

31:54.486 --> 31:56.206
Come on, Cole.

31:56.206 --> 31:57.826
You can do it, baby.

31:58.006 --> 31:59.446
Could that be it?

32:01.246 --> 32:03.326
Yeah. I got it.

32:07.686 --> 32:08.846
Modelo?

32:12.526 --> 32:14.126
Whoo!

32:15.486 --> 32:17.006
Gracias. -Gracias.

32:18.526 --> 32:20.686
Last team may be
eliminated! -Good job.

32:20.686 --> 32:21.846
Maroon team.

32:21.846 --> 32:23.166
They're right there.

32:24.486 --> 32:26.011
Come on, let's do this.

32:26.046 --> 32:27.446
Along the wall.
Could it be inside?

32:27.446 --> 32:29.206
Is that marked right there?

32:29.206 --> 32:30.406
Marked for the next clue.

32:30.406 --> 32:32.766
You want to do this or do you
want me to do it? -It's up to you.

32:32.766 --> 32:34.006
You do it, you do it.

32:34.006 --> 32:35.046
Let's go over here.

32:35.046 --> 32:36.486
You've got it.
Erin, be confident.

32:36.486 --> 32:37.846
There's another one.

32:37.846 --> 32:39.806
Designer...

32:39.806 --> 32:42.006
This designer...

32:42.006 --> 32:43.966
..is Carmen.

32:43.966 --> 32:46.406
OK. (READS CLUE QUIETLY)

32:46.406 --> 32:48.526
I'll do it, man.
-Alright, you got it.

32:48.526 --> 32:49.766
Oh, come on.

32:58.086 --> 32:59.846
Sheri and Cole, you
are team number six.

32:59.846 --> 33:00.846
Yeah!

33:00.846 --> 33:02.371
Congratulations.

33:02.406 --> 33:03.606
Anyone speak English?

33:05.046 --> 33:06.766
Anyone speak English?

33:06.766 --> 33:08.486
English?

33:08.486 --> 33:09.926
No. OK.

33:09.926 --> 33:12.126
I'll just have to figure
out where I'm going.

33:12.126 --> 33:14.206
Did you see Scott
and Blair here? -No.

33:14.206 --> 33:15.406
Maybe they're coming.

33:15.406 --> 33:16.906
Have you seen them?
I haven't seen them.

33:16.886 --> 33:18.406
You haven't seen
anybody today? -No.

33:18.406 --> 33:21.846
We've been by ourselves all
day. We could be first, last...

33:21.846 --> 33:23.366
We have no idea.

33:23.366 --> 33:26.846
I was hoping that there's some
teams still here at the Roadblock.

33:26.846 --> 33:29.966
This is where Joslyn's Spanish
would come in very handy.

33:29.966 --> 33:33.166
Adriana. Looking for Adriana.

33:33.166 --> 33:34.246
Custom pattern.

33:36.126 --> 33:37.766
There you go, let's go!

33:37.766 --> 33:39.526
OK, one more.

33:39.526 --> 33:41.446
Mochila?

33:41.446 --> 33:45.246
That way! Oh, Daddy, come!

33:45.246 --> 33:47.006
You're left holding
the bags. -OK.

33:47.006 --> 33:49.646
This is taking so much time.

33:49.646 --> 33:51.406
Where is it?

33:54.366 --> 33:56.571
Is this marked?

33:56.606 --> 33:58.446
There's no marker here.

33:58.446 --> 33:59.966
Oh, my gosh.

34:03.486 --> 34:04.846
OK, that's not marked.

34:07.366 --> 34:09.646
Need two like this.

34:09.646 --> 34:11.126
No?

34:11.126 --> 34:12.556
Nothing?

34:13.926 --> 34:15.481
Same designer, yeah?

34:15.166 --> 34:17.036
Designer. Person.

34:17.036 --> 34:18.366
No tengo.

34:18.366 --> 34:21.726
We're sitting in a lot of traffic
here and the sun is also going down.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.926
It looks like it's going
to be night-time really soon

34:23.926 --> 34:27.076
so we'll probably be doing the next
section of the race in the dark,

34:27.076 --> 34:28.366
which makes it harder.

34:28.366 --> 34:30.366
And we have to search
for a mochila vendor

34:30.366 --> 34:34.126
and if it's getting dark on us
here, we're going to be in trouble.

34:34.126 --> 34:35.686
How you doing?

34:35.686 --> 34:38.485
I'm trying to find these streets.
The vendors between these streets.

34:38.485 --> 34:40.406
Yeah, I've got a map and
it doesn't help, so...

34:41.766 --> 34:43.886
So where are we
now? -I don't know.

34:43.886 --> 34:45.076
That's a great question.

34:45.076 --> 34:46.606
Let me help you
here a little bit.

34:46.606 --> 34:48.886
Let's work together on it, OK?

34:48.886 --> 34:51.366
It's getting dark out, which might
make this challenge a little harder.

34:51.366 --> 34:54.726
If it is about
colours and matching.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.076
It's kind of a long day.

34:57.166 --> 34:58.411
SCOTT: We stopped,
we got a map.

34:58.446 --> 35:00.926
We circled the three places
where we've got to go.

35:00.766 --> 35:03.406
Let's keep going. -And now
we know where we're going.

35:03.406 --> 35:04.926
This place is not
that big, it's just...

35:06.366 --> 35:07.526
Marked mochila right here.

35:07.446 --> 35:08.686
No, I've already looked here.

35:08.686 --> 35:10.406
I need two like this.

35:10.406 --> 35:11.626
You have to check the tags.

35:11.646 --> 35:12.846
There are tags in here?

35:14.886 --> 35:16.366
Catalina. Catalina?

35:17.366 --> 35:18.851
Catalina.

35:18.886 --> 35:20.076
Does that match your bag?

35:20.076 --> 35:21.286
This IS my bag.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.726
Oh, my gosh, I've got to go.

35:23.726 --> 35:25.366
I'm going to look
somewhere else.

35:25.366 --> 35:26.686
Are you helping me?

35:27.686 --> 35:29.036
Here it is.

35:30.486 --> 35:31.606
Did she leave me?

35:32.766 --> 35:35.126
Come on, babe. Go,
go. -Let's go, baby.

35:36.206 --> 35:37.691
Can I have the map?

35:37.726 --> 35:39.556
Can I have the map? -No,
you ran off without me.

35:39.556 --> 35:40.686
No, I didn't!

35:40.686 --> 35:42.451
OK. -Come on with me
if you want the map.

35:42.486 --> 35:45.206
Scott, I'd already looked in
those bags earlier for my bag.

35:45.206 --> 35:46.246
I understand.

35:46.246 --> 35:47.966
That's why I ran, because
I can wait for you.

35:48.006 --> 35:49.686
That must be it.
-There's Rachel and Zach.

35:51.286 --> 35:52.481
I'm left holding the bag.

35:52.516 --> 35:54.806
Check over here.
I've been over here.

35:54.806 --> 35:55.806
Oh, my goodness.

35:57.606 --> 36:02.766
Senor, sabe usted donde
esta la Plaza Santo Domingo?

36:02.766 --> 36:04.406
Scott, Scott!

36:06.806 --> 36:08.546
There's mine, there's mine.

36:08.516 --> 36:10.286
Is that your bag? -It's mine.

36:10.286 --> 36:12.206
OK.

36:12.206 --> 36:14.026
Do you see mine?
Let me see yours.

36:14.076 --> 36:15.846
Is that it? That's
not it right there?

36:15.846 --> 36:17.166
No, my bag is not here.

36:17.166 --> 36:19.126
Let's go.

36:19.126 --> 36:20.516
I didn't mean to
leave you back there.

36:20.516 --> 36:21.806
You got excited. It's OK.

36:21.806 --> 36:24.406
The horse is beating me.

36:24.406 --> 36:26.206
Come on, horsey.
I'll race you.

36:28.806 --> 36:30.766
Oh, my goodness. Adriana!

36:31.076 --> 36:32.691
OK, I've gotten all three.

36:32.726 --> 36:35.886
Now I need to find
the right vendor

36:35.886 --> 36:39.036
and she might be where
my brother's waiting.

36:39.036 --> 36:40.246
Here.

36:40.246 --> 36:41.931
Oh, my God. Thank you, Jesus!

36:41.966 --> 36:44.041
Oh, my... Alright,
where do I go?

36:44.076 --> 36:46.366
Wait, I've got to find
mine. Where is yours?

36:47.446 --> 36:49.866
This one doesn't have
one in it. -I'm sorry.

36:50.076 --> 36:52.286
It's alright. You need
to go, you need to go.

36:52.286 --> 36:53.966
Mochila, mochila.

36:53.966 --> 36:56.166
Ooh, good mochila.

36:56.166 --> 36:57.646
Si?

36:57.646 --> 37:00.126
Si. Mochila.

37:00.126 --> 37:02.166
I found one. I need one more.

37:02.166 --> 37:03.846
OK...

37:03.846 --> 37:05.571
Was I here before?

37:05.606 --> 37:08.246
Might have been
here before. Oh, man.

37:08.246 --> 37:10.006
Oh, my goodness.

37:12.516 --> 37:14.686
I thought I'd never find it.

37:14.686 --> 37:15.886
OK, let's go.

37:19.846 --> 37:21.646
This could be it. OK,
got the bag, got the bag.

37:21.646 --> 37:23.606
I got it, I've finished.

37:23.606 --> 37:25.926
Here he is. I got you.

37:25.926 --> 37:28.726
You got it? Good
job. Got it, baby.

37:28.726 --> 37:31.846
OK, now it says
find the vendor.

37:31.846 --> 37:34.516
The name inside the
bag says Adriana.

37:34.516 --> 37:35.806
So I've got to find Adriana.

37:37.006 --> 37:39.806
Darius actually had already
finished but he didn't know

37:39.806 --> 37:42.036
where the vendor was,
which was right next to us.

37:42.036 --> 37:43.766
It was so close.

37:43.766 --> 37:46.076
I do not see my vendor.

37:50.206 --> 37:51.291
OK...

37:51.326 --> 37:53.556
Don't worry, don't
worry. We got this.

38:00.818 --> 38:02.623
Permiso. Se llama Adriana?

38:02.508 --> 38:04.428
Adriana. Adriana, no es...?

38:04.428 --> 38:05.468
Alright, cool.

38:05.468 --> 38:06.858
Se llama Adriana, su nombre?

38:06.858 --> 38:09.228
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

38:09.228 --> 38:11.468
I'm looking for the
vendor. Her name is Adriana.

38:12.508 --> 38:14.668
Adriana? Adriana.

38:14.668 --> 38:16.748
Uh!

38:16.748 --> 38:18.988
OK, I think I'm in
the totally wrong spot.

38:19.988 --> 38:21.673
I hear drums.

38:21.708 --> 38:23.668
It's going to be the Pit Stop.

38:23.668 --> 38:25.188
Yeah, good?

38:25.188 --> 38:26.428
You got it, Daddy! Stay quiet.

38:26.428 --> 38:28.028
Thank you. Just go.

38:28.028 --> 38:30.108
Dad, hurry. -This
is so frustrating.

38:30.108 --> 38:32.308
Phil! Phil!

38:33.338 --> 38:36.108
Welcome to Baluarte
in Cartagena.

38:36.108 --> 38:37.308
BOTH: Thank you.

38:37.308 --> 38:38.788
I am Miss Cartagena.

38:38.788 --> 38:41.508
Of course you are.
You're beautiful.

38:41.508 --> 38:43.308
Are you crying again? Oh.

38:44.908 --> 38:46.188
Keep moving.

38:49.548 --> 38:50.753
Uh.

38:50.788 --> 38:53.028
It might be here.
It's this one.

38:53.028 --> 38:54.468
Si.

38:54.468 --> 38:56.028
Si?

38:56.028 --> 38:57.908
Si! OK, that's three.

38:57.908 --> 38:59.378
I'm going back.

38:59.378 --> 39:00.708
Hi, Phil!

39:02.628 --> 39:03.783
You're still here.

39:03.818 --> 39:05.203
You've completed three legs.

39:05.068 --> 39:06.588
I have to say
my dad carried me

39:06.588 --> 39:08.378
literally through
this leg of the race.

39:11.378 --> 39:12.378
OK.

39:13.668 --> 39:16.028
It's getting late.
I'm getting tired.

39:17.148 --> 39:20.268
I think I'm doing the right thing
by looking for somebody named Adriana

39:20.268 --> 39:21.338
but I'm going to make sure.

39:21.338 --> 39:24.028
I'm going to head
back to where I started

39:24.028 --> 39:25.948
because I really can't
think of anything else.

39:25.948 --> 39:27.668
You've got it? -Yeah, baby.

39:27.668 --> 39:29.628
Good job, baby. Good job,
good job. Read your clue.

39:29.628 --> 39:31.668
And I know where
the Pit Stop is.

39:31.668 --> 39:33.508
Here you go. Three mochilas.

39:33.508 --> 39:34.818
Thank you so much.

39:34.818 --> 39:35.783
I think it's where I just saw.

39:35.818 --> 39:37.308
There's a bunch of
drumming and noise.

39:37.308 --> 39:38.628
Let's go.

39:38.628 --> 39:40.268
Darius has all three.
It's a foot race.

39:40.268 --> 39:41.588
He has all three.

39:41.588 --> 39:42.788
I am not getting
out on this leg.

39:46.228 --> 39:51.068
Darius can't figure out where the
vendor is so I guess we're last.

39:51.068 --> 39:52.548
Hopefully, he
can figure it out.

39:52.548 --> 39:53.788
Babe, babe, slow down.

39:53.788 --> 39:55.188
Here, take your right.

39:55.188 --> 39:56.508
Hear that? -Yeah.

39:57.988 --> 40:00.423
Adriana? Adriana, su nombre?

40:00.708 --> 40:02.858
No? Your name isn't Adriana?

40:04.308 --> 40:06.188
Oh, my goodness. You've
got to be kidding me?

40:06.188 --> 40:07.748
Is that it?
-I think it's here.

40:07.748 --> 40:09.628
Do you see Phil? -No.

40:09.628 --> 40:11.228
What the heck?

40:11.228 --> 40:14.188
The clue to go here.

40:14.188 --> 40:15.788
This is El Museo Naval.

40:15.788 --> 40:18.308
Along the wall, Museo Naval.

40:19.428 --> 40:20.508
And that's where I was.

40:21.908 --> 40:23.688
I don't see Phil!

40:23.548 --> 40:25.468
OK, then I was wrong.

40:25.468 --> 40:27.113
This is not it. -Ask someone.

40:27.148 --> 40:30.148
Baluarte de Santiago!
Baluarte de Santiago

40:30.148 --> 40:31.148
Plaza?

40:31.148 --> 40:33.468
Baluarte de Santiago?

40:33.468 --> 40:37.108
Esta esquina, la
otra, la tercera.

40:37.108 --> 40:38.268
Just three...

40:38.268 --> 40:39.948
Si. Izquierda...

40:39.948 --> 40:41.668
Let's go. We are going
to be on a foot race.

40:41.668 --> 40:43.628
Oh, dear Jesus! -Go.

40:43.628 --> 40:45.428
Are you our vendor?

40:50.338 --> 40:52.113
Gracias.

40:52.148 --> 40:53.788
Cameron, that was messed up.

40:53.508 --> 40:55.428
We just don't
know where it is.

40:55.428 --> 40:57.068
Please be it.

40:57.068 --> 40:58.443
Shall we ask one more person?

40:58.468 --> 40:59.783
Darius could have
caught up, no.

40:59.818 --> 41:02.068
Let's go. I don't blame...
-I'm running faster.

41:03.428 --> 41:05.033
We did well, huh?

41:05.068 --> 41:06.368
I love you. -I love you.

41:06.338 --> 41:07.668
Let's go! This way.

41:07.668 --> 41:08.988
There it is.

41:10.628 --> 41:13.713
Ah... alright.

41:13.748 --> 41:16.148
Zach and Rachel, you
probably know where you're at.

41:16.148 --> 41:18.338
Give us the bad news, Phil.

41:21.108 --> 41:22.988
The last team to
check in is behind you.

41:22.988 --> 41:24.428
What? -Oh.

41:30.428 --> 41:31.508
Darius and Cameron...

41:33.148 --> 41:35.668
..unfortunately, you are
the last team to arrive...

41:36.988 --> 41:38.433
..and I am very
sorry to tell you

41:38.468 --> 41:40.548
..that you have been
eliminated from the race.

41:40.548 --> 41:42.378
OK. Alright.

41:42.378 --> 41:43.548
Ooh!

41:43.548 --> 41:44.988
I know you guys gave
it everything you had.

41:44.988 --> 41:46.788
I can see it in your eyes.

41:47.858 --> 41:49.513
I feel like we gave
it our all, this leg.

41:49.548 --> 41:51.508
The last couple of legs,
we made some mistakes.

41:51.508 --> 41:53.548
A mixture of bad
luck, bad decisions.

41:53.548 --> 41:55.148
It didn't work out, you know?

41:55.148 --> 41:57.308
I mean, you lose
bit by bit but...

41:59.338 --> 42:02.668
I mean, I couldn't really
run it with anybody else.

42:02.668 --> 42:04.908
Yeah. If anybody,
this guy, you know,

42:04.908 --> 42:07.248
'cause we're the closest,
I know him the best

42:06.628 --> 42:09.588
and know he's capable
of doing amazing things.

42:42.191 --> 42:44.631
Blair plus Brodie

Blodie.

42:45.871 --> 42:47.756
<i>Teams do some bench work...</i>

42:47.791 --> 42:50.191

switches gears.</i>

42:52.111 --> 42:53.431
