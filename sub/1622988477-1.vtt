01:05.838 --> 01:08.846
He's here.

01:40.109 --> 01:41.965
Not so fast.

01:41.997 --> 01:43.374
Hey, pat him down.

01:52.078 --> 01:52.878
He's clear.

01:59.181 --> 02:01.037
I take it that's for me.

02:34.222 --> 02:36.717
If you want anymore,
you know who to see.

03:04.878 --> 03:06.317
He's running, check the cash!

04:05.837 --> 04:06.958
The
United Kingdom is now

04:06.990 --> 04:09.198
in a national
state of emergency.

04:09.230 --> 04:11.086
As the country experiences
the worst rising crimes

04:11.118 --> 04:13.134
since the 2011 riots.

04:13.166 --> 04:16.046
Shocking immages yet again,
as violence on the streets

04:16.077 --> 04:18.541
of Britain escalates
as looting, arson

04:18.574 --> 04:21.422
and rioting continues for
the third month in a row.

04:21.454 --> 04:23.053
Fuck the government.

04:23.085 --> 04:24.238
Fuck all the police.

04:24.270 --> 04:25.550
'Cause we got nothing for you

04:25.582 --> 04:27.182
but crowbars and gauges.

04:27.214 --> 04:28.974
We own the fucking streets now.

04:29.006 --> 04:30.126
The prime
minister has resigned

04:30.158 --> 04:32.846
from office after yet another
failed assassination attempt.

04:32.878 --> 04:34.062
The latest violence

04:34.094 --> 04:35.790
erupted in the streets
of Manchester today.

04:35.822 --> 04:38.030
As police encountered
missiles and petrol bombs...

04:38.062 --> 04:39.118
I need
the police, please

04:39.150 --> 04:40.622
they're trying to get in.

04:40.654 --> 04:42.606
They're coming,
they've got a gun!

04:45.550 --> 04:47.310
We're running the
fucking roads now, yeah?

04:47.342 --> 04:48.973
Anyone come on the
corner you're gonna see

04:49.005 --> 04:51.118
thirty of my G's all
with shooters yeah?

04:51.150 --> 04:52.876
The feds better not
come to the block,

04:52.909 --> 04:54.926
we're gonna go burn down the
fucking high street right now.

04:54.958 --> 04:56.270
Reports
suggest that over recent months

04:56.302 --> 04:57.613
the more innovative gangs

04:57.645 --> 04:59.790
have even begun
hijacking phone masts

04:59.822 --> 05:02.381
and hacking directly
into their networks.

05:02.413 --> 05:04.078
As long as there is a
corresponding satellite

05:04.110 --> 05:05.486
up there in the sky.

05:05.518 --> 05:06.862
More
and more demoralized

05:06.894 --> 05:09.196
British troops are now
deserting by the day.

05:09.229 --> 05:11.182
Having given up on
government and a war

05:11.214 --> 05:13.134
they no longer believe in.

05:13.166 --> 05:14.190
Another shipment

05:14.222 --> 05:15.885
of military grade
weapons was stolen

05:15.916 --> 05:17.998
from a government storage
facility in Kent today.

05:18.030 --> 05:19.693
The armed masked gang made off

05:19.725 --> 05:21.166
with various firearms
and explosives.

05:21.198 --> 05:23.182
The
mandatory evacuation

05:23.214 --> 05:24.590
of Mainland Britain will begin...

05:24.622 --> 05:26.894
With the remaining
populated areas

05:26.926 --> 05:29.356
to be divided into
individual sub-sectors.

05:29.390 --> 05:31.758
So, society
just fucking collapsed

05:31.790 --> 05:33.453
before our very own eyes.

05:33.486 --> 05:35.342
The world has fucking changed.

05:35.373 --> 05:36.973
It's dangerous, it's not safe.

05:37.005 --> 05:38.990
You don't know what's
going on nowadays.

05:39.022 --> 05:40.494
Everybody's lost and...

05:42.510 --> 05:45.134
The year is 2035.

05:45.166 --> 05:49.453
Due to an uncontrollable rise
in crime and civil conflict,

05:49.485 --> 05:51.630
the island formerly known
as the United Kingdom

05:51.662 --> 05:54.702
has now been almost
completely evacuated.

05:54.734 --> 05:56.366
What little society was left

05:56.398 --> 06:00.110
has since rapidly crumbled
into an apocalyptic wasteland.

06:00.142 --> 06:03.342
Although banks no longer
exist, money is still regarded

06:03.374 --> 06:05.294
as the highest form of currency.

06:05.326 --> 06:07.022
And blood is shed every day

06:07.053 --> 06:09.229
over the sale of
food and narcotics.

06:09.262 --> 06:11.022
With no police
force or government

06:11.054 --> 06:13.421
left to control it's
remaining population,

06:13.453 --> 06:15.662
Britain has now become
a no-man's land.

06:15.693 --> 06:18.542
Ruled only by the brutal
gangs and crime syndicates

06:18.573 --> 06:20.782
that dare to
inhabit the streets.

06:26.414 --> 06:28.429
Where the fuck is it?

06:28.462 --> 06:30.286
Where is it?

06:40.014 --> 06:42.317
Bullshit, how many have you got?

06:42.350 --> 06:44.782
Four fucking barrels?

06:44.814 --> 06:46.157
Fucking die!

06:51.950 --> 06:54.349
Now then, where the fuck is it?

06:54.382 --> 06:56.206
You've already been!
There's none left!

06:56.238 --> 06:57.198
Bullshit!

06:57.229 --> 06:58.318
You're stupid!

06:58.350 --> 07:00.942
Even handling that stuff without
protective gear is fatal.

07:05.646 --> 07:06.573
You daft bastard!

07:06.606 --> 07:07.630
He fucking called me stupid!

07:07.662 --> 07:08.749
You are fucking stupid!

07:08.782 --> 07:11.342
- Fuck you.
- Fucking, come on.

07:12.685 --> 07:14.253
Pack it in, all of you.

07:14.286 --> 07:16.173
I've just been on
the phone to Icepick.

07:16.206 --> 07:18.126
He's got four fucking barrels.

07:18.158 --> 07:21.134
There's fuck all here, come on!

07:32.749 --> 07:35.566
Radiation levels, normal.

07:35.598 --> 07:38.605
Oxygen levels, 35 tromatons.

07:45.325 --> 07:46.541
Oi!

08:24.654 --> 08:27.086
Please tell me you
didn't fuck it all up.

08:27.117 --> 08:29.102
Well, put it this way,

08:29.133 --> 08:31.405
as soon as I got there,
they started attacking me.

08:39.534 --> 08:41.549
The fuck you say, Phista?

08:41.582 --> 08:43.181
So what did you do?

08:43.214 --> 08:44.236
What you think?

08:47.629 --> 08:48.493
I didn't know you can
switch personalities

08:48.526 --> 08:50.350
in your fucking sleep.

08:50.382 --> 08:53.198
I thought if I sent you I'd
have nothing to worry about.

08:53.230 --> 08:54.382
I did right though, didn't I?

08:54.414 --> 08:55.438
Just shot em' all.

08:55.469 --> 08:56.814
And now I've run out of bullets.

08:56.846 --> 08:58.893
So where are you now?

08:58.926 --> 09:01.454
Not too far from base.

09:01.486 --> 09:02.541
Have you heard owt off Magnum?

09:02.574 --> 09:03.693
Yeah, he's here with me.

09:03.726 --> 09:04.974
Hang about there,

09:05.005 --> 09:06.286
we'll come and meet
you at at Center 14.

09:09.422 --> 09:11.150
Enter my territory will ya?

09:11.181 --> 09:13.486
Kill my brothers!

09:13.518 --> 09:15.598
What were that bang?
Who's shouting?

09:15.629 --> 09:16.941
It's a Trojan!

09:16.974 --> 09:18.861
I Thought you'd
fucking shot em' all.

09:18.894 --> 09:20.365
I did shoot them all.

09:20.398 --> 09:21.325
All three of them.

09:21.358 --> 09:22.349
Oh, for fuck's sake.

09:22.382 --> 09:24.461
There's four Trojan's,
Phista, there's four of them.

09:24.494 --> 09:25.870
Get down here now,
he's really pissed off.

09:25.902 --> 09:26.893
Oi!

09:26.926 --> 09:28.557
Just take cover, run our way!

09:28.590 --> 09:30.510
What's going on, man?

09:30.542 --> 09:31.374
Phista is getting shot at!

09:31.406 --> 09:32.430
Come on.

09:50.574 --> 09:52.622
Phista, where are ya? Eh?

09:58.669 --> 10:00.270
Come out then!

10:11.757 --> 10:12.717
Where are you?

10:12.750 --> 10:14.029
Come out you fucking coward.

10:28.941 --> 10:30.222
For fuck's sake, Hurry up, Wire!

10:32.142 --> 10:32.910
Oh, shit.

10:43.597 --> 10:45.230
Don't worry, Phista.

10:45.261 --> 10:47.021
You can come out now.

10:47.054 --> 10:48.270
Everything's fine.

10:59.694 --> 11:00.717
Wire.

11:00.750 --> 11:01.806
How you doing, pal?

11:02.797 --> 11:03.949
I'd be doing a lot better

11:03.982 --> 11:05.581
if that weren't
pointed at my head.

11:05.613 --> 11:07.758
Thought you were good
at dodging bullets.

11:07.789 --> 11:09.517
Depends who's firing the gun.

11:10.477 --> 11:13.166
That's the thing when you're
exterminating termites

11:13.197 --> 11:15.533
You gotta make sure
you get every last one.

11:15.565 --> 11:17.389
You still killing
termites, Triggy?

11:18.286 --> 11:20.013
Only the ones I don't like.

11:20.046 --> 11:22.957
In a world where scum
like that come out, right?

11:22.990 --> 11:24.621
Society needs people like us.

11:25.581 --> 11:28.430
It's a pity, your friend Yayo,

11:28.461 --> 11:30.670
doesn't have his head screwed
on like the rest of ya.

11:30.702 --> 11:32.493
I take it he's still missing.

11:32.526 --> 11:33.678
It's been five days now.

11:34.606 --> 11:36.301
We've heard nothing.

11:36.333 --> 11:37.582
I'll keep a look out for him.

11:37.613 --> 11:39.086
You've got my number.

11:40.398 --> 11:41.901
Give us a call.

11:41.934 --> 11:43.661
He's an idiot, but
he's a good lad.

11:44.846 --> 11:46.861
I'm sure he's fine.

11:46.893 --> 11:47.790
You know Yayo.

11:49.550 --> 11:51.437
Yeah, I do know Yayo.

11:52.590 --> 11:53.933
Too fucking well.

13:09.197 --> 13:11.629
Come on boys, get this shit out.

13:47.853 --> 13:48.813
Day 36.

13:50.733 --> 13:52.974
Riconium levels at 35%.

13:54.254 --> 13:55.501
Subject is stable.

13:56.526 --> 13:59.981
I'm worried, without a strong
replacement for Riconium.

14:01.326 --> 14:02.446
I'm gonna lose her.

14:15.501 --> 14:16.943
We're outside.

14:16.974 --> 14:18.701
I need that Riconium urgently.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.430
I'm almost out here.

14:20.461 --> 14:21.678
You wanna get off your ass

14:21.710 --> 14:24.014
and open the fucking door
and we'll bring it in.

14:24.045 --> 14:26.061
Did you get the
amount I asked for?

14:26.094 --> 14:27.373
Don't worry about that.

14:27.406 --> 14:28.909
Just make sure you've
got my fucking money.

14:30.925 --> 14:32.941
I've got your money.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.223
I've got your money, mate.

14:36.494 --> 14:37.103
Wanker.

14:38.670 --> 14:39.501
Come on, lads!

14:45.870 --> 14:47.981
You drop that thing
again and I'll drop you.

14:48.014 --> 14:49.869
Pick it up nobhead!

14:58.990 --> 15:00.589
We're currently reporting
live from outside

15:00.621 --> 15:03.501
the Mosborough EBVI research
facility in sector 14.

15:03.534 --> 15:04.750
Where just a few hours ago

15:04.781 --> 15:05.966
their entire supply of Reconium

15:05.998 --> 15:07.854
was stolen by Dismemberers.

15:07.886 --> 15:09.678
In a continued chain
of similar raids,

15:09.710 --> 15:11.310
hundreds have
already been killed.

15:11.341 --> 15:13.101
Our correspondent,
Lisa Romero tried

15:13.134 --> 15:14.606
to talk to Operative
Lance Kaufman

15:14.638 --> 15:15.534
earlier this morning

15:15.566 --> 15:17.261
but the interview was cut shot.

15:17.294 --> 15:18.734
And as far as we know...

15:23.597 --> 15:24.589
What are you doing, man?

15:24.621 --> 15:26.861
That's some important shit.

16:22.830 --> 16:24.013
You miss me?

16:25.293 --> 16:27.021
I tried to explain,
it was an accident.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.302
It was, you know?

16:28.334 --> 16:30.990
Killing a couple of his
fucking Scottish wankers?

16:32.910 --> 16:35.821
It's how you play the game
as far as I'm concerned.

16:35.853 --> 16:37.998
Boss, we found this.

16:48.205 --> 16:50.029
Where did you find this?

16:50.061 --> 16:52.014
From Mosborough, out the labs.

16:55.053 --> 16:58.190
Well aren't you good
little boys, hey?

16:58.222 --> 17:00.525
Well, aren't you gonna
give us some money or what?

17:00.557 --> 17:01.421
I'll give you the fucking change

17:01.453 --> 17:02.733
outta that you little shit.

17:07.854 --> 17:08.846
Little bastards.

17:10.766 --> 17:12.685
What the fuck is it, boss?

17:12.718 --> 17:13.550
Fuck knows.

17:14.925 --> 17:16.077
Stick it with the
rest of the shite.

17:18.957 --> 17:21.198
I don't understand how
this could have happened.

17:21.230 --> 17:22.893
That room was sealed.

17:22.925 --> 17:24.813
How'd they even get in?

17:24.846 --> 17:26.574
The security teams said they
came in through the fence

17:26.605 --> 17:28.686
and the two that took
were quite small.

17:28.718 --> 17:29.902
Possibly children.

17:29.934 --> 17:31.309
Well then how would
they know what it was?

17:31.341 --> 17:32.814
How would anyone
know what it was?

17:32.846 --> 17:35.181
None of this makes any sense.

17:35.214 --> 17:37.197
Well, maybe this'll help.

17:37.229 --> 17:40.077
The tracking device fitted to
the canister is still live.

17:40.109 --> 17:40.941
If this keeps flashing,

17:40.974 --> 17:43.342
we know that no one's
tried to open it up.

17:43.374 --> 17:45.006
It's not good enough.

17:56.205 --> 17:58.606
Right, I need you all
to listen to me, please.

18:01.582 --> 18:04.462
Attacliff Labs was also
broken into just before us.

18:04.494 --> 18:06.350
Now at the moment,
we don't know why

18:06.382 --> 18:07.821
these break-ins are happening

18:07.854 --> 18:09.038
or what they're planning to do

18:09.071 --> 18:10.158
with the Riconium
they've stolen.

18:11.310 --> 18:13.998
But all of that
is now irrelevant.

18:14.030 --> 18:15.822
I don't want anyone to panic,

18:15.854 --> 18:17.902
but having conducted a
thorough sweep of the building,

18:17.934 --> 18:22.189
we know that they've
managed to steal, Unit 11.

18:43.341 --> 18:44.173
Where is he?

18:51.885 --> 18:52.845
So this is it then, yeah?

18:52.877 --> 18:53.518
You're back?

18:53.550 --> 18:54.893
I didn't even leave.

18:54.925 --> 18:56.078
Didn't leave?

18:56.110 --> 18:57.773
You've been gone for
five fucking days, Yayo.

18:59.182 --> 18:59.982
What's that?

19:05.550 --> 19:08.141
Yo! What the fuck are
you doing with my shit?

19:08.173 --> 19:08.814
Hey!

19:12.205 --> 19:13.454
What are you doing, man?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.150
I told you a thousand times,

19:15.182 --> 19:16.941
don't ever bring
drugs into Borough.

19:19.086 --> 19:19.950
Fucking leave it.

19:20.974 --> 19:21.966
What the fuck?

19:21.998 --> 19:23.086
Do you know who that
coke belonged to?

19:23.118 --> 19:23.982
Do you think I give a fuck?

19:24.014 --> 19:24.846
Well you should.

19:24.878 --> 19:25.774
Well, I don't.

19:25.806 --> 19:27.373
You sure about that, Wire?

19:27.405 --> 19:29.646
Who? Barney boy's
warlocks, try me!

19:29.678 --> 19:30.926
A bit further south.

19:32.269 --> 19:34.157
Even you're not
that fucking stupid.

19:34.189 --> 19:36.366
You really think I'd
fucking lie about it?

19:37.390 --> 19:38.574
You're trying to tell me

19:38.606 --> 19:40.078
you brought that from
Midland's cartel?

19:40.110 --> 19:42.733
I wasn't planning you
fucking burning it was I!

19:43.374 --> 19:45.038
You daft bastard!

19:45.070 --> 19:46.926
Get off me!

19:56.301 --> 19:57.293
He started it!

19:57.326 --> 19:58.221
Do you wanna know
what he's done?

19:58.253 --> 20:00.430
Get him out of my fucking face!

20:05.134 --> 20:07.342
This is getting beyond
a fucking joke, this.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.006
Why is this taking so long?

20:09.038 --> 20:10.190
Where is the bastard?

20:11.726 --> 20:12.942
Well why don't you ask
him to go about our money.

20:12.974 --> 20:14.638
I'm not working for fuck all.

20:18.862 --> 20:21.133
He's got a point though.

20:21.165 --> 20:22.702
I don't give a fuck
about his crippled wife.

20:22.734 --> 20:25.997
If he doesn't show up soon,
I'm gonna burn that bastard!

21:27.630 --> 21:30.221
How long is it gonna
go on for, David?

21:32.205 --> 21:35.021
What you're doing is wrong.

21:35.053 --> 21:36.174
How many people?

21:37.198 --> 21:40.110
Taking other people's money.

21:40.142 --> 21:43.118
Listen, the lab,
it's almost finished.

21:44.653 --> 21:46.605
I've started moving
equipment in there already.

21:47.886 --> 21:50.702
The cryo-amplifier,
it's up and running.

21:50.733 --> 21:54.316
I just need a bit more
time and a bit more money.

21:54.350 --> 21:55.374
Look at me.

21:56.782 --> 21:57.550
I'm dying.

21:59.630 --> 22:02.062
Don't say things like that.

22:02.094 --> 22:03.150
You're gonna be fine.

22:22.413 --> 22:24.302
It's
about bloody time.

22:24.333 --> 22:25.518
You still there?

22:25.549 --> 22:27.182
Of course I'm
still here, dickhead.

22:27.213 --> 22:29.198
Where the fucking hell are you?

22:29.230 --> 22:31.214
I'll meet you outside.

22:36.974 --> 22:37.870
Look, there's
obviously just been

22:37.902 --> 22:39.566
some big misunderstanding.

22:39.597 --> 22:41.517
We'd never fuck with
cartels, you know that.

22:41.550 --> 22:42.925
Well I don't know that, do I?

22:42.958 --> 22:44.430
Especially when I've
got one of your boys

22:44.462 --> 22:45.646
coming down here and mugging me

22:45.678 --> 22:48.398
out of 10 grands
worth of my gear.

22:48.430 --> 22:50.414
You've got three days
before I find you

22:50.446 --> 22:52.462
and change you for fucking life.

23:03.150 --> 23:04.366
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:05.294 --> 23:06.189
Friend of yours?

23:08.397 --> 23:11.598
Barely, I met him on
patrol this morning.

23:11.629 --> 23:14.414
My name's Jarrod Simmons,
I need your help.

23:14.446 --> 23:16.014
Got that right.

23:16.046 --> 23:17.806
Nah, it's all right, Wire man.

23:17.837 --> 23:19.342
Just a bit stupid, that's all.

23:21.229 --> 23:22.318
Well, when I'm
getting phone calls

23:22.350 --> 23:23.853
from certified gangsters

23:23.886 --> 23:25.420
saying that they're gonna
blow my fucking head off.

23:25.454 --> 23:27.118
Stupid people
sneaking up behind me

23:27.150 --> 23:29.294
is something that
I just don't need.

23:29.326 --> 23:32.366
I'm sorry, but it's important.

23:32.397 --> 23:34.157
Whatever it is,
we're not interested.

23:34.190 --> 23:35.150
We've got enough
shit to sort out.

23:35.182 --> 23:36.398
You'll have to ask someone else.

23:36.430 --> 23:37.293
Like who?

23:37.326 --> 23:38.638
I don't fucking know.

23:38.670 --> 23:40.046
And in case you hadn't noticed,

23:40.077 --> 23:41.294
we don't like you
lot around sector 14.

23:41.326 --> 23:42.957
So stop mithering me
with your bullshit

23:42.990 --> 23:44.206
and fucking do one.

23:45.166 --> 23:46.285
Look, that were them.

23:46.318 --> 23:48.174
Now they're gonna give us three
days to get that money back

23:48.205 --> 23:50.446
or they're gonna start
sending cars to sector 14.

23:50.477 --> 23:51.085
What are we gonna do then?

23:51.118 --> 23:52.174
If I can just butt in.

23:52.205 --> 23:55.277
Look, I've told you, we can't
fucking help you, Jarrod.

23:55.310 --> 23:57.134
But if you don't hear me out,

23:57.166 --> 23:59.406
none of us will be
here in three days.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.869
It's important, it
affects all of us.

24:14.510 --> 24:15.437
10 grand.

24:16.590 --> 24:18.254
Will you fucking stay
out of this, Yayo?

24:18.286 --> 24:19.758
You've caused enough
problems this morning.

24:19.789 --> 24:20.686
Go in the other room!

24:20.718 --> 24:22.094
It makes sense, doesn't it?

24:22.126 --> 24:23.502
I owe 10 grand to Midlands boys,

24:23.533 --> 24:25.358
we might as well take this
job and get it paid off.

24:25.390 --> 24:26.574
We're not the
fucking A-Team, Yayo.

24:26.605 --> 24:28.046
We don't take jobs.

24:28.077 --> 24:29.806
Well, we need to get
the money up somehow.

24:35.822 --> 24:37.966
This is all you've got?

24:37.998 --> 24:41.486
We've got barrels and
barrels of the stuff.

24:41.517 --> 24:43.246
There isn't an endless
supply, you know?

24:43.277 --> 24:45.390
We've cleared the
place, this is the lot.

24:45.422 --> 24:46.638
My wife's dying here

24:46.669 --> 24:49.197
and this is the only stuff
that keeps her alive.

24:49.230 --> 24:50.446
You think I'm gonna
pull the plug?

24:50.478 --> 24:53.070
You're just gonna
have to look harder.

24:53.102 --> 24:54.797
There isn't anymore Maeson!

24:54.830 --> 24:56.334
And don't get mouthy with me,

24:56.365 --> 24:58.222
telling me what I
need to be doing

24:58.254 --> 25:00.621
and what I don't
need to be doing.

25:00.654 --> 25:03.758
We've fucking fleeced
every laboratory

25:03.790 --> 25:06.573
from fucking here to
Doncaster for you.

25:06.606 --> 25:09.422
All the way to Doncaster.

25:09.453 --> 25:12.366
That's nothing, look further.

25:12.398 --> 25:13.486
And find me some more.

25:28.750 --> 25:29.934
Right, then, Yayo.

25:29.965 --> 25:31.533
Stop what you're doing
and pay attention.

25:31.566 --> 25:32.749
We need to go over these maps

25:32.782 --> 25:34.190
so that none of your
stray off course.

25:34.221 --> 25:35.406
I don't see why
I can't just take

25:35.437 --> 25:36.493
one of the bikes
and go on my own.

25:36.526 --> 25:37.453
It'll be quicker than this shit.

25:37.486 --> 25:38.861
Yayo, have you even looked

25:38.894 --> 25:40.366
at how much petrol is
left in those bikes.

25:40.398 --> 25:42.062
You won't make it
past sector 14.

25:42.093 --> 25:43.342
Another reason why you
shouldn't be driving

25:43.374 --> 25:45.614
about all over
like some dickhead.

25:45.646 --> 25:46.510
And if I were you
I'd start acting

25:46.541 --> 25:48.461
like you actually wanna
be part of this team

25:48.494 --> 25:50.094
'cause at the minute, I
feel like kicking you out.

25:50.125 --> 25:52.461
All right, fucking hell.

25:53.613 --> 25:54.798
Now, Triggy's marked
out these sections

25:54.829 --> 25:56.430
in the map called inferno's.

25:56.462 --> 25:57.550
Large areas of woodland

25:57.582 --> 25:59.085
that are patrolled by poachers.

25:59.117 --> 26:00.941
They're hunters that track
wanderers like you for fun

26:00.974 --> 26:02.446
and if they see you,
they will shoot to kill.

26:02.478 --> 26:04.110
Do you understand?

26:13.806 --> 26:16.397
Get up, I'm getting
pissed off now.

26:16.430 --> 26:17.582
Put that bloody phone down.

26:18.894 --> 26:20.462
All right, I'm listening.

26:33.677 --> 26:35.501
You all know where you're going?

26:35.534 --> 26:38.477
Yayo's got a copy of maps
on his phone to make sure.

26:38.510 --> 26:39.534
So stick to them.

26:40.622 --> 26:42.414
Don't be trying to
take no daft shortcuts.

26:43.789 --> 26:45.486
Is there a problem?

26:45.517 --> 26:46.765
Yeah, you've already said
all this shit last night.

26:46.798 --> 26:48.493
Can we not just
fucking get on with it?

26:48.526 --> 26:49.965
Well, most of what I say

26:49.997 --> 26:51.469
seems to go in one ear and
out the other ear, don't it?

26:51.502 --> 26:52.493
So we'll have to keep saying it

26:52.525 --> 26:54.413
until people like
you start listening.

26:54.445 --> 26:55.725
So get fucking walking.

27:21.166 --> 27:22.126
Day 37.

27:23.182 --> 27:24.813
Diane is now stable.

27:24.846 --> 27:27.630
Thanks to the Reconium that
was collected yesterday.

27:29.294 --> 27:31.310
Whilst in the labs,
the Dismemberers

27:31.341 --> 27:35.341
also found something
else, a green canister.

27:36.750 --> 27:39.469
And currently I've
no idea what it is.

27:40.590 --> 27:43.373
A need a closer look.

28:00.206 --> 28:03.821
It's like some kind
of super formula.

28:03.854 --> 28:05.837
It can actually bond
with living tissue.

28:07.021 --> 28:09.581
I can actually see it
replacing blood cells

28:09.614 --> 28:11.661
and making them stronger.

28:11.694 --> 28:13.199
It's incredible.

28:18.510 --> 28:19.693
I've got it, it's ready.

28:23.246 --> 28:24.141
Diane?

28:32.814 --> 28:34.254
Diane!

28:34.286 --> 28:35.982
Hello, boys and girls.

28:37.134 --> 28:39.949
Welcome to a very,
very special broadcast

28:39.982 --> 28:42.766
of the local Icepick show.

28:42.797 --> 28:47.533
With my very special guest
David shithouse Maeson.

28:51.213 --> 28:52.302
Get off me!

28:52.333 --> 28:53.230
Get off me!

28:54.383 --> 28:55.213
Get off!

29:05.581 --> 29:07.693
No!

29:07.726 --> 29:08.557
No!

29:21.390 --> 29:24.206
I'm very sorry I couldn't
be with you today.

29:24.239 --> 29:26.957
And to be honest,
I find watching

29:26.990 --> 29:29.517
me mates getting the
shit kicked out of them

29:29.550 --> 29:33.646
as more of a spectator
sport, you know?

29:33.677 --> 29:35.501
I warned you, didn't I?

29:35.533 --> 29:38.510
I told you what would
happen if you didn't pay up.

29:38.543 --> 29:39.789
Now I'm gonna leave you.

29:40.941 --> 29:42.894
And I want you to
think long and hard

29:43.790 --> 29:46.541
about what you've made me do.

29:48.270 --> 29:50.670
Lad's, show me the bird.

29:52.046 --> 29:52.877
Back in a bit baby.

29:57.613 --> 29:59.598
Yes, you will be damned.

30:02.925 --> 30:05.997
Get the fuck away from her!

30:06.030 --> 30:08.877
Well, well, well, Maeson.

30:08.910 --> 30:10.830
You sly old dog.

30:10.861 --> 30:12.654
You never mentioned
she was a looker.

30:12.685 --> 30:14.381
I wouldn't climb off her until

30:14.414 --> 30:17.261
the neighbors complained
about the fucking smell.

30:18.637 --> 30:19.886
I'll get you your money.

30:20.814 --> 30:22.157
See him there?

30:24.590 --> 30:26.894
I think he's got
something in his trousers

30:26.925 --> 30:28.781
for your missus.

30:28.814 --> 30:29.837
No!

30:29.869 --> 30:30.894
No!

30:36.270 --> 30:38.670
Get that fucking
thing away from her!

30:38.701 --> 30:40.943
Hey bollocks, don't
tell my lads what to do.

30:42.573 --> 30:46.254
What you have to remember,
is this is your fault.

30:46.285 --> 30:47.694
You brought this on yourself.

30:48.750 --> 30:50.510
But I'm desperate.

30:50.543 --> 30:53.327
She's my life, she's my world.

30:53.358 --> 30:57.006
And that chemical, that
chemical you brought yesterday.

30:57.037 --> 30:57.837
I can save her.

30:59.183 --> 31:01.103
I can save, I can save her life

31:02.733 --> 31:04.653
You've gotta believe me.

31:04.686 --> 31:08.205
I'll get all your
money, all your money.

31:08.237 --> 31:09.710
All right.

31:09.743 --> 31:11.630
All right, I understand.

31:14.221 --> 31:16.845
I know you're a
good lad, Maeson.

31:16.877 --> 31:19.310
And I know given the
time you'll come through.

31:20.654 --> 31:22.893
You don't have to play
all these stupid games.

31:24.014 --> 31:24.974
I believe you.

31:26.733 --> 31:28.781
I understand.

31:29.710 --> 31:30.637
Really?

31:34.125 --> 31:35.054
No.

31:56.750 --> 31:57.742
Why?

32:01.005 --> 32:03.821
There's only one thing
I can promise, Maeson.

32:03.853 --> 32:05.934
You will be together forever.

32:07.821 --> 32:10.127
That's all I fucking want.

32:10.158 --> 32:11.790
Well why wait then, hey?

32:19.886 --> 32:21.229
Do it!

32:21.261 --> 32:22.093
Do it!

32:32.973 --> 32:34.734
Wire's not happy
with you, you know.

32:34.765 --> 32:35.951
You think I don't know that?

32:35.982 --> 32:37.549
He's barely said a
word to me all morning.

32:37.581 --> 32:39.534
I just wanna get this
shit over and done with.

32:39.565 --> 32:41.613
So he can shut up
going on about it?

32:44.334 --> 32:46.574
Have you seen how
far we've gotta walk?

32:46.607 --> 32:48.013
If we go the way that Wire says.

32:48.045 --> 32:49.678
It's like fucking 40 miles.

32:49.710 --> 32:50.925
Shut up!

32:50.957 --> 32:51.949
This route that him
and Triggy planned

32:51.981 --> 32:53.486
goes the long way around.

32:53.518 --> 32:55.151
Stick to the map, Yayo.

32:55.182 --> 32:56.174
Look, there's a shortcut

32:56.207 --> 32:57.774
straight through
the woods there.

32:57.805 --> 32:59.087
It'll get us there
in half the time

32:59.118 --> 33:00.685
and I know which way I'm going.

33:00.717 --> 33:01.677
Do you even know the way?

33:01.709 --> 33:02.894
Shut up and just follow me.

33:02.927 --> 33:04.814
We'll be here al day
talking about it.

33:10.766 --> 33:11.566
Wait up!

33:16.109 --> 33:18.957
Wire will never
find out, will he?

33:18.989 --> 33:20.685
Will he?

33:20.717 --> 33:21.294
I don't know, man.

33:21.326 --> 33:22.765
These woods are sketchy.

33:22.797 --> 33:24.749
I thought you was
on this shortcut?

33:24.781 --> 33:25.998
The woods are dodgy.

33:26.030 --> 33:27.373
It feels like we're being
watched or something.

33:27.405 --> 33:28.782
Phista, there is
nobody watching you.

33:28.814 --> 33:30.253
Chill out, Yayo.

33:30.285 --> 33:32.750
Phista's right, there could
be anyone in these woods.

33:32.782 --> 33:34.093
Let's just stick to the path.

33:34.125 --> 33:35.021
Oh, for fuck sake.

33:35.053 --> 33:36.622
There is no one in these woods!

33:42.254 --> 33:43.246
What kind of shooting is that?

33:43.278 --> 33:44.238
My fucking gun jammed.

33:44.270 --> 33:45.294
I'll jam you.

33:46.190 --> 33:47.725
Yeah, we got three live ones

33:47.757 --> 33:48.942
heading east to the inferno.

33:48.974 --> 33:50.862
Right, this way people!

33:54.477 --> 33:55.854
Come on, let's go after them.

33:55.886 --> 33:58.542
Nah, nah, nah. The
boys have got them.

34:10.286 --> 34:11.118
Go on lads!

34:21.197 --> 34:22.029
Fuck!

35:09.806 --> 35:13.133
Oh, someone set off the rabbit.

35:13.165 --> 35:14.861
Go check that out.

35:36.109 --> 35:37.230
Eat that you fucking...

35:52.110 --> 35:52.942
Oi!

36:00.302 --> 36:01.101
Magnum!

36:18.926 --> 36:20.269
I knew there was
someone in these woods.

36:20.301 --> 36:22.093
He never listens to me.

36:22.125 --> 36:23.214
Yayo!

36:23.246 --> 36:24.141
Yayo!

36:24.174 --> 36:25.454
Shut the fuck up, shouting man.

36:32.430 --> 36:33.966
Yayo!

36:37.485 --> 36:39.534
Yayo, Yayo!

36:39.566 --> 36:41.806
Stop fucking shouting!

36:47.181 --> 36:49.101
Yo! Are you two okay?

36:49.134 --> 36:51.916
Am I okay? Get
the fuck here now!

36:54.030 --> 36:56.302
Calm down, ya fucking idiot.

37:03.150 --> 37:04.301
Oh fuck!

37:04.333 --> 37:05.646
Exactly, now follow me.

37:05.678 --> 37:07.245
I think I found a way
out back up there.

37:18.862 --> 37:20.206
That way, fucking go now.

37:32.782 --> 37:35.116
Hunter's injured, at
least three casualties.

37:35.150 --> 37:38.126
We've had to pull back,
it's a mess down here.

37:38.158 --> 37:39.502
Fucking amateurs.

37:39.534 --> 37:41.422
These aren't your
average drifters, these.

37:41.454 --> 37:44.078
Get Sax on radio, he's
gonna want in on this.

37:56.236 --> 37:57.069
Wait.

37:58.734 --> 38:00.941
Is this your fucking idea
of a fucking shortcut?

38:00.973 --> 38:01.997
I'm sorry!

38:02.030 --> 38:03.438
Are you thick or something.

38:03.470 --> 38:05.070
Let's stick to the fucking plan.

38:05.102 --> 38:06.254
I said I'm sorry, lads.

38:06.286 --> 38:07.309
You do this all the time.

38:07.342 --> 38:09.006
You're not the one in charge.

38:09.038 --> 38:13.006
You're not the one who decides
if I fucking die or not.

38:13.038 --> 38:13.902
I'm sorry, lads.

38:13.934 --> 38:17.005
I'm fucking sorry, lads.

38:19.245 --> 38:20.302
I honesty didn't know.

38:22.190 --> 38:24.174
I thought it would
get us there quicker.

38:25.454 --> 38:26.414
We're family.

38:27.598 --> 38:28.780
Do you really think
I'd have done anything

38:28.813 --> 38:30.445
to purposely put us in trouble?

38:31.309 --> 38:33.646
After all these fucking years,

38:33.677 --> 38:35.918
you know I'd take bullet
for either of you.

38:37.134 --> 38:39.022
I'm fucking sorry, lad.

38:49.230 --> 38:50.414
All right, Yayo.

38:50.446 --> 38:51.917
Just don't do owt
like that again.

38:51.950 --> 38:53.934
My head can't deal with it.

39:33.230 --> 39:35.438
It's like
some kind of super formula,

39:35.470 --> 39:37.454
it can actually bond
with living tissue.

39:39.022 --> 39:41.230
I can actually see it
replacing blood cells

39:41.262 --> 39:43.150
and making them stronger.

39:43.182 --> 39:44.365
It's incredible.

39:56.430 --> 39:58.254
I've run in and
dashed this stick

39:58.286 --> 40:00.302
straight into this
guys head and that.

40:00.333 --> 40:02.350
He were knocked
out on the floor.

40:02.382 --> 40:03.502
Blood seeping down his face...

40:11.278 --> 40:13.517
Yayo, the canister's
tracker's stopped responding.

40:13.550 --> 40:14.446
It's been opened.

40:14.477 --> 40:15.982
Jarrod's just fucking rang me.

40:16.014 --> 40:18.414
Their head office in Russia
have found out it's been stolen.

40:18.446 --> 40:19.533
We've got less than 24 hours

40:19.566 --> 40:21.422
before they launch
a fucking airstrike.

40:21.453 --> 40:23.406
Do you really think they're
gonna launch a strike?

40:23.438 --> 40:25.326
It's not a case of
what I think, Yayo.

40:25.358 --> 40:27.373
This is fucking happening now.

40:27.406 --> 40:29.518
Right, okay so either
way then, we're fucked.

40:29.550 --> 40:31.182
I'm gonna meet you
at Eastman Valley

40:31.213 --> 40:32.717
at morning and we're gonna
get it back together.

40:32.750 --> 40:34.797
And get it back here before
their bosses in Russia

40:34.830 --> 40:36.078
have a chance to
press any buttons

40:36.109 --> 40:37.933
and do something stupid.

40:37.966 --> 40:40.366
Check this, Siren's
been going through

40:40.397 --> 40:42.414
them files that Jarrod left.

40:42.446 --> 40:43.502
And it turns ut this canister's

40:43.533 --> 40:45.453
way more dangerous
than we thought.

40:55.342 --> 40:56.365
How do we get out of here?

40:56.398 --> 40:57.294
What are you doing?
get back in there.

40:57.325 --> 40:58.734
Sit fucking tight...

40:58.766 --> 41:01.517
I can't sit fucking tight.

41:01.550 --> 41:03.470
Now get in and sort it!

41:07.374 --> 41:09.422
Fuck the fucking lot of ya!

41:13.422 --> 41:15.278
Unit 11's a top secret
government bio-weapon.

41:15.310 --> 41:17.070
They've been working
on it for years.

41:17.102 --> 41:19.694
No, one's supposed
to know about it.

41:27.566 --> 41:29.710
It's a super steroid,
genetic enhancement.

41:29.742 --> 41:30.798
All that bollocks.

41:30.829 --> 41:32.782
Some full on "Universal
Soldier" shit.

41:34.317 --> 41:35.342
Look, whoever you are,

41:35.373 --> 41:37.614
just take all you
want and fuck off!

41:46.062 --> 41:46.830
Maeson?

41:50.445 --> 41:52.397
They've also found out that
the last known location

41:52.430 --> 41:54.317
of this canister
is at the facility

41:54.350 --> 41:55.726
of a guy called David Maeson.

42:00.493 --> 42:01.678
I looked him up.

42:01.709 --> 42:03.310
He's some ex-big time
government scientist

42:03.342 --> 42:04.525
that got fired after going mad

42:04.558 --> 42:05.997
when he's wife got
terminally ill.

42:06.030 --> 42:07.246
And if he's got it,

42:07.278 --> 42:08.750
it's not gonna be
easy to get back.

42:12.109 --> 42:14.062
If he's worked out the full
potential of this canister,

42:14.094 --> 42:16.557
then he's not just gonna
wanna give it up to anyone.

42:16.590 --> 42:18.542
And he's more than likely
got a building full of guns

42:18.573 --> 42:21.197
getting paid to make sure
that we don't get it off him.

42:21.230 --> 42:23.470
And if he's been
exposed to it himself,

42:23.502 --> 42:25.518
he's gonna be close
to unstoppable.

43:10.317 --> 43:12.014
You got the radio message, then?

43:16.910 --> 43:19.405
Would I be here if I didn't?

43:21.229 --> 43:22.957
This is gonna be interesting.

43:24.910 --> 43:26.733
I'm gonna be
setting off in a minute.

43:26.766 --> 43:27.982
Siren's spent most the night

43:28.013 --> 43:29.357
building me an electric bike.

43:29.390 --> 43:30.606
So it'll get me
about three quarters

43:30.637 --> 43:32.366
of the way before
battery runs out.

43:32.397 --> 43:34.669
Remember, do not go in that
facility until I get there.

43:34.702 --> 43:36.237
I'll see you all soon.

45:44.303 --> 45:46.605
That looks like the place.

45:46.637 --> 45:48.654
Big factory in the
middle of a valley.

45:48.685 --> 45:49.581
That would do it.

45:49.614 --> 45:50.445
I just thought there'd be a ton

45:50.477 --> 45:51.661
of this Dismemberers
here, look around you.

45:51.693 --> 45:52.717
It's fucking dead.

45:53.677 --> 45:54.830
And your point being?

45:54.863 --> 45:56.718
Well, we could just wait
until they come back

45:56.750 --> 45:58.094
and bait this whole area up.

45:58.125 --> 46:00.301
Or we could just go in
now while it's quiet.

46:01.134 --> 46:02.861
For fuck sake, Yayo.

46:02.894 --> 46:03.503
What?

46:03.534 --> 46:04.494
What you mean, what?

46:04.526 --> 46:05.997
I'm just trying to make
shit easier for everyone.

46:06.030 --> 46:06.957
I can just go inside
and get it quickly.

46:06.990 --> 46:08.173
No way.

46:08.206 --> 46:10.254
I am not doing another
fucking Yayo plan.

46:10.286 --> 46:11.278
Look what happened yesterday.

46:11.310 --> 46:12.685
Yes, yesterday was my fault.

46:12.717 --> 46:13.901
I fully admit that.

46:13.933 --> 46:15.534
And if the building
wasn't unguarded,

46:15.565 --> 46:17.966
I wouldn't even be entertaining
the idea of going inside.

46:17.998 --> 46:19.437
I don't know, Yayo.

46:19.470 --> 46:21.165
It was me that goes
into this situation.

46:21.197 --> 46:23.085
I want to be the
person to get us out.

46:23.758 --> 46:25.486
Just let me put this right.

49:07.886 --> 49:09.486
Run!

49:09.518 --> 49:10.317
Run!

49:19.246 --> 49:21.613
Come on, lads, let's go.

49:46.894 --> 49:47.725
Freeze!

49:56.494 --> 49:58.349
Fucking drop it now.

49:58.381 --> 49:59.726
Canister, now!

50:03.566 --> 50:05.901
I won't fucking ask again.

50:08.814 --> 50:12.782
Will someone tell me why,
he's got one of our men?

50:12.814 --> 50:14.030
I'll snap his neck,
I swear to God.

50:14.062 --> 50:16.365
Well do it, then, big man.

50:16.397 --> 50:17.229
Then what?

50:18.414 --> 50:21.165
Someone just ran off
with my canister.

50:21.197 --> 50:22.093
If I don't get it back...

50:22.125 --> 50:23.981
Yeah I know, three of them.

50:24.013 --> 50:25.901
I've got trackers
on them already.

50:28.206 --> 50:31.086
So let him go,
we'll start again.

50:31.118 --> 50:33.230
And I might help you
get this canister back.

50:54.957 --> 50:55.982
Did we lose him?

50:58.030 --> 50:59.661
That was
close, wasn't it?

50:59.693 --> 51:01.453
I'm so fucking tired of running.

51:02.573 --> 51:03.982
And I've dropped me bastard hat!

51:04.014 --> 51:05.870
All that matters
now is getting home.

51:06.894 --> 51:08.654
I've got the canister.

51:10.734 --> 51:12.109
Wire's gonna be buzzing.

51:32.590 --> 51:34.061
So this is it then, yeah?

51:34.093 --> 51:35.758
Silent treatment
all the way home?

51:35.790 --> 51:37.550
What'd you want me
to say, I'm worried.

51:37.582 --> 51:39.885
Fuck that guy, I'm
not scared of him.

51:39.917 --> 51:41.486
Yeah, you look it, you idiot.

51:41.518 --> 51:43.374
I'm going for a piss.

51:43.406 --> 51:45.070
He's right you know.

51:45.102 --> 51:46.318
Well, it's done now, innit?

51:46.350 --> 51:48.750
You really should ring
Wire and tell him.

51:48.782 --> 51:50.413
Yeah, I will do.

51:50.445 --> 51:51.950
Actually, why
don't you ring him?

51:51.982 --> 51:53.229
No battery.

52:02.126 --> 52:04.142
How long's it gonna take, lad?

52:04.174 --> 52:05.390
Probably trying to find it.

52:15.054 --> 52:16.269
Phista!

52:17.038 --> 52:17.870
Phista!

52:19.373 --> 52:23.021
Freeze,
don't fucking move.

52:23.053 --> 52:23.694
Run!

52:33.966 --> 52:35.501
Get him!

52:55.470 --> 52:56.270
Phista!

53:02.413 --> 53:04.846
How the fuck could
we have lost him?

53:04.878 --> 53:05.902
Oi!

53:12.076 --> 53:12.909
Get him!

53:27.502 --> 53:29.261
Shit!

53:29.293 --> 53:30.478
Go back that way.

54:16.365 --> 54:18.317
Wire, where are you?

54:18.350 --> 54:19.598
I'm on the way to
meet your lot, why?

54:19.630 --> 54:20.845
Listen mate, I fucked up.

54:20.878 --> 54:21.646
I can't explain
it over the phone.

54:21.678 --> 54:23.629
I need to meet you now.

54:23.662 --> 54:25.262
What are you on about now, you?

54:25.293 --> 54:26.446
Put Magnum on.

54:26.478 --> 54:27.820
We passed the factory
about a mile back

54:27.853 --> 54:29.166
near Crystal Lake Reservoir.

54:29.198 --> 54:31.118
Just meet me there
in ten minutes.

54:31.150 --> 54:32.620
Ah, what the fuck have
you done now, Yayo?

54:32.653 --> 54:34.222
I can't explain
it over the phone!

54:35.214 --> 54:36.046
Sorry, Wire.

54:36.910 --> 54:38.380
Yayo!

54:38.413 --> 54:39.630
Oh, for fuck sakes!

55:13.102 --> 55:14.829
My phone, my phone.

55:17.389 --> 55:18.766
Oh, no battery!

55:20.013 --> 55:21.102
Fuck's sake!

55:34.413 --> 55:36.237
Wire, just listen to me.

55:36.270 --> 55:37.230
I can help.

55:37.262 --> 55:38.094
You can help?

55:38.126 --> 55:39.469
It's because of you
and your fucking about

55:39.502 --> 55:40.910
that we're here in
the first place.

55:40.942 --> 55:43.118
It's because of you we
had to leave Sector 14.

55:43.150 --> 55:43.950
It's because of you,

55:43.982 --> 55:46.030
that now Phista is
probably fucking dead.

55:46.062 --> 55:47.182
I can't do it anymore, man.

55:47.214 --> 55:49.966
I can't take it,
Yayo, you're done.

55:49.998 --> 55:52.301
Now just do us all a
favor and fuck off!

55:53.326 --> 55:54.414
But where will I go?

55:56.270 --> 55:58.413
You've never had a
problem vanishing.

55:58.446 --> 56:00.046
I'm sure you'll find
someone else's life

56:00.077 --> 56:01.230
to fucking jeopardize.

56:03.438 --> 56:06.222
I will not fucking
tell you again!

56:06.253 --> 56:07.278
Fuck off!

56:25.549 --> 56:27.950
I thought I fucking
told you to stay still.

56:31.053 --> 56:33.262
Look, you can make this
so much easier on yourself

56:33.294 --> 56:36.590
if you just call your boys
and get the canister back.

56:42.573 --> 56:44.206
I get it.

56:44.237 --> 56:47.438
You don't wanna crash
your boys up, I get that.

56:47.470 --> 56:48.941
This ain't personal.

56:48.974 --> 56:51.373
But the guy who
wants his canister,

56:51.406 --> 56:53.934
from what I've just
seen after meeting him,

56:53.966 --> 56:56.238
he's not gonna stop 'til
he's got it in his hands.

57:15.021 --> 57:17.293
You know when I said,
call me if you need help?

57:19.086 --> 57:20.654
This isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

57:20.686 --> 57:22.541
You didn't have to come Triggy.

57:22.574 --> 57:24.174
Didn't have to bring two
of our cars either, did I?

57:24.205 --> 57:25.710
You can always walk home, Wire.

57:29.357 --> 57:31.885
Look, that old north side
entrance is been guarded.

57:31.918 --> 57:33.453
Phista's being captured
somewhere inside

57:33.486 --> 57:35.310
and I don't know
where Magnum is.

57:35.342 --> 57:37.037
What about Yayo?

57:38.413 --> 57:39.534
Don't worry about him.

57:41.197 --> 57:42.382
So it's just us three?

58:29.166 --> 58:30.445
Two minutes ago,

58:30.478 --> 58:33.262
one of my guys on the
inside just informed me

58:33.293 --> 58:36.525
that Russian army has
released military jets

58:36.557 --> 58:39.374
and they seem to be heading
towards the United Kingdom.

58:39.405 --> 58:40.590
For all my listeners out there,

58:40.622 --> 58:42.702
I need you to provide
me with a little...

58:56.173 --> 58:57.262
Am I glad to see you.

58:57.293 --> 58:58.541
It's found him.

59:02.541 --> 59:03.470
Watch my fingers.

59:24.557 --> 59:25.550
Fuck!

59:34.125 --> 59:36.622
He's fucking escaped,
sound the alarms now!

59:46.189 --> 59:48.142
Go, go, go, to the roof!

59:58.510 --> 59:59.502
Keep that fucker going

59:59.533 --> 01:00:00.589
I'm getting the truck.

01:00:34.222 --> 01:00:34.990
Can you not hear that now?

01:00:35.022 --> 01:00:35.821
What?

01:00:35.853 --> 01:00:36.781
Oh, nowt, nowt, nowt.

01:00:36.813 --> 01:00:38.637
Just a fucking was kicking off!

01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:40.461
Now get about!

01:00:40.494 --> 01:00:42.510
Go, go, go, move in!

01:01:44.013 --> 01:01:45.677
That doesn't belong
to you, does it?

01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:08.814
You fucking bastard!

01:02:17.903 --> 01:02:19.533
Now you turn up?

01:02:19.566 --> 01:02:20.590
Cop for him.

01:02:39.534 --> 01:02:42.606
Careful, he's a wriggly
little cunt that one.

01:02:48.174 --> 01:02:49.005
I've got it.

01:02:53.005 --> 01:02:54.383
Don't fucking move.

01:02:55.821 --> 01:02:56.814
What should we do with him?

01:02:56.845 --> 01:02:57.645
Kill the cunt.

01:03:41.901 --> 01:03:42.733
Magnum?

01:03:44.877 --> 01:03:45.709
Magnum.

01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:07.342
Don't lose it this time.

01:04:13.871 --> 01:04:14.670
Wait up!

01:04:14.701 --> 01:04:15.534
Wait up!

01:04:17.006 --> 01:04:17.838
Wait up!

01:04:22.285 --> 01:04:23.405
About time.

01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:28.462
The fucks he doing here?

01:04:28.494 --> 01:04:30.765
He just stopped me
from getting smashed.

01:04:30.797 --> 01:04:31.406
Yeah, it looks like he did.

01:04:31.438 --> 01:04:33.071
Wire, I owe him my life.

01:04:40.461 --> 01:04:41.325
I found him.

01:04:41.357 --> 01:04:42.734
Jarrod, you need to work fast.

01:04:42.767 --> 01:04:44.750
We don't have much time.

01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:53.037
Standing
by, target is inbound.

01:04:58.765 --> 01:05:00.781
Jarrod, man, you're gonna
get yourself killed.

01:05:00.813 --> 01:05:02.733
If we don't disarm that canister

01:05:02.765 --> 01:05:03.629
we're all gonna get killed.

01:05:03.661 --> 01:05:05.581
Head office have found
out what's happening...

01:05:05.613 --> 01:05:06.734
Jarrod, please,
we need an update.

01:05:06.767 --> 01:05:08.686
Valentina, we haven't
got much longer.

01:05:08.718 --> 01:05:10.189
They're giving us 30 minutes

01:05:10.221 --> 01:05:11.758
and then they're gonna
fire the first warhead.

01:05:11.790 --> 01:05:13.901
I can hear, I'm just trying
to think of something...

01:05:19.374 --> 01:05:20.845
We've found them

01:05:20.877 --> 01:05:22.958
Send the fucking boys now,
send the fucking boys now!

01:05:22.991 --> 01:05:23.821
Fuck!

01:05:25.709 --> 01:05:27.341
Oh, fucking hell, Jarrod.

01:05:28.846 --> 01:05:29.966
Jarrod, stay with me!

01:05:29.998 --> 01:05:31.694
We're out of position.

01:05:31.726 --> 01:05:35.053
Jarrod, Jarrod come
in, do you copy?

01:05:40.813 --> 01:05:43.374
I think he's dead, man.

01:05:43.406 --> 01:05:45.741
You think I don't
fucking know that, Yayo.

01:05:46.991 --> 01:05:49.741
Jarrod, are you there?

01:05:49.774 --> 01:05:50.798
We've lost contact.

01:05:50.831 --> 01:05:52.557
You've got to hold
off the airstrike.

01:05:52.589 --> 01:05:53.678
Jet's already inbound.

01:05:53.711 --> 01:05:56.814
No, I understand that but
there are innocent people here.

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:21.486
Well, Wire, what's next?

01:06:24.590 --> 01:06:25.422
Well?

01:06:27.566 --> 01:06:29.037
Can we do this or not?

01:06:36.846 --> 01:06:39.791
Siren, we need eyes
in all directions.

01:06:39.822 --> 01:06:40.878
Head to your highest
vantage point possible

01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:42.413
and keep us covered.

01:06:42.445 --> 01:06:44.494
Phista, Trigger, Magnum,

01:06:44.526 --> 01:06:46.093
I need you all on
ground level with me.

01:06:46.125 --> 01:06:49.197
We gotta keep these hunters
busy as long as possible.

01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:50.029
And Yayo...

01:06:50.061 --> 01:06:51.053
Ill do anything, man.

01:06:51.085 --> 01:06:51.917
Yayo!

01:06:52.781 --> 01:06:55.182
You want me to forget
about what you've done?

01:06:58.733 --> 01:07:00.461
Just get us that canister back.

01:07:30.926 --> 01:07:32.333
Come on!

01:08:06.733 --> 01:08:07.342
Phista!

01:08:08.846 --> 01:08:12.014
Magnum, Spread out!

01:08:12.046 --> 01:08:13.806
Yayo, the canister!

01:08:14.798 --> 01:08:15.630
Now!

01:09:00.813 --> 01:09:02.062
You're not going anywhere.

01:09:40.173 --> 01:09:41.453
Go, go, go!

01:10:41.326 --> 01:10:42.317
Phista!

01:10:56.302 --> 01:10:57.102
Magnum!

01:11:39.246 --> 01:11:41.133
See, that's what we do!

01:11:44.846 --> 01:11:46.318
Right, you, take cover
up on that ridge.

01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:48.878
You, just fucking do
something useful and

01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:49.710
get me fucking...

01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:48.014
Look, I just want the canister.

01:12:52.206 --> 01:12:54.253
Want my canister do ya?

01:12:59.534 --> 01:13:02.381
Why does every cunt want
to take what's mine?

01:16:02.670 --> 01:16:04.237
Shit!

01:18:04.558 --> 01:18:07.438
I know why you
wanted the canister.

01:18:07.470 --> 01:18:08.973
You don't know nothing.

01:18:10.734 --> 01:18:12.013
I see what they did to her.

01:18:15.886 --> 01:18:19.597
Think about it, look around.

01:18:22.606 --> 01:18:25.646
You think she would
have wanted this?

01:19:17.997 --> 01:19:18.829
Magnum!

01:19:25.677 --> 01:19:26.927
It ends here.

01:19:33.582 --> 01:19:34.381
Are we winning?

01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:37.165
Come on, we need to go.

01:19:38.542 --> 01:19:40.526
There's nowhere left to go.

01:19:57.710 --> 01:20:01.487
approaching target.

01:20:01.518 --> 01:20:04.110
T-minus five minutes.

01:20:13.677 --> 01:20:14.958
Everyone, quiet.

01:20:17.293 --> 01:20:18.798
Loud and clear.

01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:20.205
We've got it.

01:20:20.237 --> 01:20:21.678
And Jarrod's bag but none of us

01:20:21.710 --> 01:20:22.702
have a fucking clue
how to disarm it.

01:20:22.734 --> 01:20:25.901
We have the canister,
repeat, we have the canister.

01:20:25.933 --> 01:20:27.853
Lads, I need you
to do something.

01:20:27.885 --> 01:20:29.901
Listen, I'm gonna
stick you on headset to Siren.

01:20:29.934 --> 01:20:32.111
Now she can't speak so she's not

01:20:32.142 --> 01:20:34.127
gonna be able to answer
you back but trust me

01:20:34.158 --> 01:20:36.750
she's best chance we've
got of getting this sorted.

01:20:37.645 --> 01:20:41.613
Okay, I will explain the
process step by step.

01:20:41.645 --> 01:20:43.181
Please listen very carefully.

01:20:43.213 --> 01:20:46.381
You should see a blue
chemical, remove the stopper

01:20:46.413 --> 01:20:49.678
and pour exactly half of it
into the empty measuring valve.

01:20:49.710 --> 01:20:51.407
Be very careful,

01:20:51.438 --> 01:20:54.446
it does not come into contact
with you or anything else.

01:20:58.701 --> 01:21:00.781
Next, take the pink formula

01:21:00.813 --> 01:21:03.693
and add further 10
milliliters into the valve.

01:21:07.565 --> 01:21:08.878
The final component you will add

01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:11.662
will cause an instant
chemical reaction.

01:21:11.694 --> 01:21:14.957
Mixed correctly, the whole
thing will turn black.

01:21:14.989 --> 01:21:17.773
If it's not mixed correctly,
it will stay green.

01:21:17.805 --> 01:21:19.885
And we'll have no
way of disarming it.

01:21:30.349 --> 01:21:33.614
30
seconds to target.

01:21:45.326 --> 01:21:46.541
She's done
it, she's done it.

01:21:46.573 --> 01:21:47.918
Call the fucking jets off.

01:21:48.942 --> 01:21:50.734
We've done it, we've done it.

01:21:50.766 --> 01:21:52.751
It's been disarmed.

01:21:55.726 --> 01:21:58.254
Unit 11
has been neutralized.

01:21:58.285 --> 01:22:01.294
Abort mission, I
repeat, abort mission.

01:22:01.326 --> 01:22:03.470
Returning back to base.

01:22:15.694 --> 01:22:16.974
Where you going?

01:22:29.262 --> 01:22:30.382
Wait up, lad.

01:22:32.078 --> 01:22:34.765
Did you not hear
all that gunfire?

01:22:34.797 --> 01:22:35.725
Them three are still out there.

01:22:58.926 --> 01:22:59.918
Fuck!

01:23:02.062 --> 01:23:04.046
Fuck, Yayo, stupid bastard!

01:23:18.158 --> 01:23:18.990
Siren!

01:23:29.902 --> 01:23:30.798
An
official statement

01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:32.269
has been given today regarding

01:23:32.301 --> 01:23:35.310
the recent incident at the
sector 14 research facility.

01:23:35.342 --> 01:23:37.294
Director, Louis Banks,
denies all rumors

01:23:37.326 --> 01:23:38.989
of any possible
chemical weapons...

01:23:39.021 --> 01:23:40.877
Rumors of
possible chemical weapons

01:23:40.909 --> 01:23:42.318
programs being conducted...

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:44.621
Spotted
entering the Island's

01:23:44.653 --> 01:23:46.286
coastline have
now been confirmed

01:23:46.318 --> 01:23:48.782
as a result of a
training exercise.

01:23:48.814 --> 01:23:49.934
Their
occupied facilities

01:23:49.966 --> 01:23:52.654
have established a purely...

01:23:52.686 --> 01:23:55.566
He also
confirmed that the EDVI

01:23:55.598 --> 01:23:58.638
have no involvement in any
bioengineering technology,

01:23:58.670 --> 01:24:00.526
military medical experiments

01:24:00.558 --> 01:24:02.861
or the rumored chemical
enhancement program.

01:24:02.893 --> 01:24:03.917
Chemical
enhancement program

01:24:03.949 --> 01:24:06.158
known as Unit 11.

01:24:34.766 --> 01:24:37.646
I can't believe you
stole that truck.

01:24:37.678 --> 01:24:38.702
Suits ya.

01:24:41.038 --> 01:24:43.149
It'd suit me a
lot better though.

01:24:48.462 --> 01:24:50.861
I feel a lot safer with
Siren driving to be honest.

01:24:50.893 --> 01:24:52.110
Yeah, if I was driving it

01:24:52.142 --> 01:24:54.894
there wouldn't be a little
robot riding shotgun.

01:24:59.533 --> 01:25:00.974
How you feeling?

01:25:02.638 --> 01:25:04.622
Yeah, sound.

01:25:04.653 --> 01:25:06.221
Did you phone the cartel?

01:25:06.253 --> 01:25:07.885
Tell them why it's took so long.

01:25:07.918 --> 01:25:10.734
Yeah, well they're not happy.

01:25:12.109 --> 01:25:13.965
You know they're probably
gonna kill me right.
