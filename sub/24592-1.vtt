First prom with my dudes.

02:20.014 --> 02:21.766
It's hot. I need something to drink.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.554
- Hello.
- Hello.

02:27.605 --> 02:28.606
Making you thirsty?

02:28.690 --> 02:29.607
- Yeah.
- Okay.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.691
- Having fun?
- Yeah, I'm having fun.

02:38.408 --> 02:42.036
- The fields, field of dreams.
- Yup.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.413
And that's home base.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.082
- Did I get that right?
- No, that's the pitcher's...

02:46.166 --> 02:47.810
- That's the pitcher's mound.
- You don't have an idea.

02:47.834 --> 02:48.960
There is home base.

02:49.168 --> 02:51.504
- And that's where you stand?
- Yeah, yeah.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.468
Where all your dreams came true.

02:55.550 --> 02:56.550
Yeah.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.932
Are you sad about graduating?

03:03.808 --> 03:06.352
Not really. Are you?

03:07.061 --> 03:08.730
Chloe and I are gonna come visit you...

03:09.689 --> 03:10.689
obviously.

03:13.484 --> 03:15.153
I'm just glad I have another year here.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.448
I can't imagine leaving this place.

03:20.366 --> 03:23.244
I think if you do it right,
it never really leaves you.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.540
Sorry, I just heard that
and threw up in my own mouth.

03:31.628 --> 03:32.712
I hope you're right.

03:38.301 --> 03:41.971
Hey! Come on. Limo's here.
Let's get some double-doubles.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.140
Okay. Be right there.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.196
Oh, my God,
I got so wasted last night.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.240
So, wait, what happened?

04:00.406 --> 04:03.117
The bouncer wouldn't let you in
with your In-N-Out.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.173
Which was obviously unacceptable.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.456
Right. So, that's when we hoisted
you over the wall of the patio.

04:08.706 --> 04:10.466
And then,
you fall into the cactus.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.120
Oh, dude. They're everywhere.

04:13.378 --> 04:16.464
It's like I was giving blowies
in the desert all night.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.716
Oh, fuck. I have work tomorrow.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.886
Yeah, I have a practice exam
in the morning.

04:22.345 --> 04:23.345
All right.

04:24.305 --> 04:25.807
- Bye, ladies.
- Bye.

04:26.182 --> 04:27.725
- I love you.
- Bye.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.227
Bye.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.204
Okay. To the homestead?

04:35.733 --> 04:37.453
Thomas wants us to come
to Top of the World.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.446
- Cool.
- Okay, okay, okay.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.699
Would you rather
lose all the hair on your body

04:42.949 --> 04:44.492
or be a prostitute for a week?

04:45.702 --> 04:47.161
- Prostitute for a week.
- Easily.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.163
You didn't even hear the parameters.

04:49.664 --> 04:52.083
No hair whatsoever,
no eyebrows, no lashes.

04:52.166 --> 04:54.502
Oh, please. Come on.
I pay good money to have hot wax

04:54.585 --> 04:55.938
rip most of that shit
out of my body anyway.

04:55.962 --> 04:59.299
Yeah, for real.
But seriously, feel how smooth.

05:00.174 --> 05:01.259
Is it good?

05:01.342 --> 05:03.678
It might be cool
to be all slithery like a dolphin.

05:04.887 --> 05:09.475
I don't think I'd do well as a prostitute.
I'd definitely end up a truck-stop boy.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.228
I'd be an escort, but I'd only take jobs
from Johns who, like,

05:12.312 --> 05:14.022
- wanted to be dominated and stuff.
- Yeah.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.025
You guys have always sucked at this.

05:17.108 --> 05:20.320
Whatever. Your go-to used to be
fart out of your mouth or sweat piss?

05:20.403 --> 05:23.197
Still a valid question.
You lack imagination.

05:24.782 --> 05:28.369
Can't believe school's in your hands now.
It's all downhill.

05:28.745 --> 05:29.905
Every year says that.

05:30.038 --> 05:33.207
And this bitch will be president
and these things will be extra special.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.859
All right. Come on.
I'm tired as balls. Let's get out of here.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.632
Thomas, I told mom
we'd be home soon.

05:42.550 --> 05:43.760
Xi'an dinner tomorrow night?

05:43.843 --> 05:46.220
- Oh, definitely.
- Okay.

05:46.637 --> 05:48.639
We got to hit all the usual spots
before you go.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.811
Okay. Bye, Thomas.
See you at home.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.189
Don't be too long. Mom's gonna be pissed.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.068
Love you.

06:02.653 --> 06:03.821
Love you, girls.

06:25.176 --> 06:27.553
<i>Today we mark a moment
we will never understand,</i>

06:28.930 --> 06:30.431
<i>that life stops.</i>

06:31.682 --> 06:34.102
<i>A son, a brother,</i>

06:35.311 --> 06:38.606
<i>a friend was taken from us.</i>

06:40.274 --> 06:41.543
<i>I've tried to take comfort in the fact</i>

06:41.567 --> 06:43.569
<i>that we are now
the stewards of his story...</i>

06:45.029 --> 06:46.114
<i>...of his joy,</i>

06:47.198 --> 06:48.282
<i>of his life.</i>

06:50.034 --> 06:52.370
<i>We must hold on to that and to each other.</i>

07:03.798 --> 07:07.343
Oh, my God. Chloe,
we're so sorry. He meant so much to us.

07:07.635 --> 07:10.263
No. Not right now. No.

07:21.149 --> 07:24.277
<i>What other way is there to heal
the pain than to think of him and cry,</i>

07:25.653 --> 07:30.116
<i>and laugh, and be together?</i>

07:51.179 --> 07:52.179
Mint?

07:55.516 --> 07:56.767
I'm gonna chug it.

08:01.063 --> 08:02.773
Oh! My eyes.

08:04.901 --> 08:08.112
Oh shit. You guys, we're late for yoga.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.864
Namast-gay.

08:10.364 --> 08:13.576
Oh. I got to meet with Student Council
Noah about prom.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.299
You, you have your college meeting, yeah?

08:15.453 --> 08:16.746
Oh, yeah. I should roll.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.748
- Love you.
- Love you, bye.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.561
Okay. So it's all finished?

08:22.585 --> 08:23.961
- Pretty much.
- Okay. Great.

08:24.295 --> 08:27.256
Are you sure you want to shut down
a full road for a red carpet?

08:27.757 --> 08:31.844
Yes. Big gestures are very important.
Okay. So, what I'm thinking...

08:31.928 --> 08:33.054
Hey, Lil.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.347
Top of the afternoon, Guy.

08:36.432 --> 08:38.558
Aren't you supposed to be
in my class right now?

08:39.434 --> 08:41.395
Aren't you supposed to be
in your class right now?

08:42.980 --> 08:45.149
- This never happened.
- What never happened?

08:47.026 --> 08:47.860
Here you go.

08:47.944 --> 08:50.321
Okay. I'm super excited.
I'm gonna plaster these around.

08:50.404 --> 08:51.989
I'm thinking bathroom stalls.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.273
Because people taking shits
are a very captive audience.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.160
Ooh. Yeah. I like the way you move.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.162
- Yeah. Bye.
- Bye.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.171
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.506
How'd it go?

09:08.923 --> 09:10.925
Uh, waitlist. Should find out this week.

09:11.008 --> 09:13.844
She just keeps telling me
to think positive thoughts.

09:14.845 --> 09:17.431
Sometimes I just wanna punch her
in her third eye.

09:17.848 --> 09:21.727
I guess if I don't get in,
Santa Barbara wouldn't be that bad.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.021
No. Hm-mmm.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.357
You're going to NYU
and I'm going to Columbia.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.109
We're gonna be life partners forever.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.487
God, imagine how many times
we've walked these halls and thought

09:31.904 --> 09:34.699
three months, two months, two weeks.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.243
How the fuck did we get here?

09:39.120 --> 09:41.539
"Time has a terrible way of fleeting by."

09:42.415 --> 09:44.584
My mom wrote that to me
in a letter when I was eight.

09:45.126 --> 09:46.460
Okay. I got to dump out.

09:51.465 --> 09:53.402
I can't believe
you like shitting at school.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.719
I'm very comfortable here.

09:55.803 --> 09:56.804
So...

09:57.096 --> 09:58.389
- Yo! What's up?
- Hey.

09:58.472 --> 09:59.908
Just the girl I was looking for.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.475
- Oh, Sam.
- Jared.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.269
Jared. Hey guys, what's up?

10:03.603 --> 10:08.149
So, we got a create-a-party tomorrow
at Carrie's and I need to spread the word.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.360
- Hold on.
- Uh-oh.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.154
I know what this is.

10:13.904 --> 10:14.904
Hi, guys.

10:15.990 --> 10:20.578
Hi. So, it was a really good day
at Path Less Taken, wasn't it?

10:20.661 --> 10:22.621
Yeah, this guy knows
what I'm talking about. Cool.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.957
Okay. So we only have
two weeks left, right?

10:25.041 --> 10:27.921
- We need to cherish...
- And so, at prom, you two going together?

10:28.085 --> 10:31.047
Well, yeah. <i>Mein Fuhrer</i> 's orders.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.258
Yeah, she used to pencil in our playdates.

10:34.342 --> 10:37.637
Prom, May 18th, it's gonna be
the best night of your life.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.531
- But it's a shame though.
- I promise you.

10:39.555 --> 10:41.635
- Buy tickets, please.
- I look fine in a tux.

10:41.682 --> 10:45.144
Please, please.
Also, party at Carrie's tomorrow night.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.896
Yes, thank you.

10:48.397 --> 10:49.774
- Bye.
- Here you go.

10:52.401 --> 10:53.319
Hey.

10:53.402 --> 10:54.820
- Yo.
- Yo.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.865
- Pretty good, huh?
- Mmm, that was nice.

10:57.948 --> 11:00.117
- Bemis alarm. 3:00.
- Oh. Ooh,

11:01.243 --> 11:02.244
Bemis.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.372
Bite my penis.

11:06.957 --> 11:09.117
- Bemis is really hot.
- I know, right?

11:09.168 --> 11:10.503
I like his wizard glasses.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.089
Yeah, I'd let him Harry Potter this.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.514
You should hide Donkey Bong better.

11:22.431 --> 11:25.351
Come on. We need him around.
His last days of high school, too.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.704
So we'll pick up tree
then meet at my house, yeah?

11:27.728 --> 11:28.771
- For sure.
- Okay. Bye.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.192
Becks.

11:34.693 --> 11:35.693
Beck.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.197
Rebecca, come on.

11:39.824 --> 11:40.824
Becks.

From Dad, "Your mother is a bitch."

12:17.820 --> 12:18.946
Is everything okay?

12:20.614 --> 12:24.910
Do you ever feel like your parents only
see you as an extension of their own ego

12:24.994 --> 12:27.830
and have no regard
for your personal happiness

12:27.913 --> 12:29.290
as an autonomous human being?

12:29.832 --> 12:32.727
Yes. And they just don't know how to
support you in the ways that you need,

12:32.751 --> 12:35.171
and that makes you feel alienated,
and then you feel guilty

12:35.254 --> 12:36.773
for feeling alienated,
and then you resent them

12:36.797 --> 12:38.900
for making you feel guilty
for feeling alienated, but the truth is

12:38.924 --> 12:41.677
they just don't have the capacity
to understand or care?

12:42.386 --> 12:44.305
Yeah. Hold on.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.807
What were you and Bemis talking about?

12:46.932 --> 12:51.645
Ugh. So, I gave a great presentation
on Kant today,

12:51.937 --> 12:55.483
and then found this in my locker.

12:56.567 --> 13:00.779
"I KANT stand this KUNT."
That's actually pretty clever.

13:01.363 --> 13:03.657
Well, fuck you, because Bemis

13:04.033 --> 13:07.453
said that my unpacking
of the third formulation was enlightened.

13:07.703 --> 13:11.665
Mmm. Are you sure he wasn't talking
about the unpacking of his cock?

13:12.291 --> 13:13.751
That... Ten and two.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.669
Jesus.

13:15.836 --> 13:18.881
Who goes there? What up?

13:18.964 --> 13:20.966
- What up?
- Okay, okay. I knew it was you.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.011
Thank you for putting up
my draconian security protocol.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.327
How y'all doing? Have a seat.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.308
Uh, I laid out
a little sample sale here.

13:29.391 --> 13:33.145
We got Pluto OG,
aka Neil deGrasse Tyson.

13:33.687 --> 13:37.149
Next up we got one I call Kramer,
because it like pops in.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.010
You know I'm saying?
And then we got Strawberry Cough

13:40.277 --> 13:42.877
and Barack O'bubba Kush,
because I know you're political and shit.

13:43.197 --> 13:44.615
- Ha!
- Get some Cough.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.518
That was your bro's favorite, too.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.748
Highs and lows?

13:53.749 --> 13:56.418
I'll go first. Highs,

13:56.919 --> 14:00.506
prom-planning, duh. Uhm, and lows,

14:01.215 --> 14:04.927
hmm, only having two weeks left
of high school with you guys.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.971
That was so sad, it sucks.

14:07.429 --> 14:09.366
Becks' eye-fucked Bemis
for, like, 30 full seconds.

14:09.390 --> 14:13.852
Oh, yeah, I did, because Amelia,
in yoga, was pose banging Aaron Jakes'

14:13.936 --> 14:14.979
like cat and cow.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.982
How about this? You like that one?
You like this one?

14:18.190 --> 14:20.359
How's my pussy looking downward dog?

14:20.568 --> 14:22.288
Oh, look at that.
What's that one?

14:22.403 --> 14:24.280
How's that back arch
for my vagina?

14:24.530 --> 14:26.574
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Aaron Jakes,

14:26.657 --> 14:29.535
the, the sophomore
who wears that puka shell necklace?

14:29.618 --> 14:31.912
- Have his balls even dropped yet?
- Yes.

14:32.746 --> 14:33.873
Into your mouth?

14:34.623 --> 14:36.625
A couple times. He could be fun for prom.

14:39.461 --> 14:42.047
Have you guys given thought
to going to prom together?

14:43.090 --> 14:44.174
Just girls?

14:44.592 --> 14:47.052
Oh, I want a real prom date,
like with a penis.

14:47.136 --> 14:50.514
I know. There will be plenty of guys
to satisfy us at After Prom.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.224
Okay. Sorry, Slutty B. Anthony.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.977
But this is about more than just
girl power and getting laid.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.396
Ugh, fine, you guys are such girls.

14:57.771 --> 14:59.371
You should invite Bemis to prom.

14:59.481 --> 15:01.734
I might invite him
to the graduation party.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.402
- Ooh.
- Hi, guys.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.112
- Hi, Jill.
- Hi.

15:05.195 --> 15:06.947
Jill, who did you take to prom?

15:07.615 --> 15:11.035
Uhm, I went with, uh, Lily's dad.

15:11.702 --> 15:16.165
So, look how well that turned out.
Just kidding.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.542
- Little girls.
- Love you.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.628
Not so little anymore.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.667
Now they're just a bunch
of washed-up skanks.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.132
- What the fuck? Shut up.
- Whoa.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.776
- Excuse me.
- They washed-up, they swag.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.986
- They all washed-up.
- Fuck you.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.030
- It's over.
- Crap, I got to pick up your sister.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.374
I need some perfume. You got any?

15:31.430 --> 15:33.724
Mom, she, she knows that you smoke.

15:33.933 --> 15:39.021
When you have kids,
you will know how important it is

15:39.355 --> 15:42.107
to keep up appearances for your children,

15:42.441 --> 15:46.195
and then slowly reveal all your flaws
when they're old enough to handle them.

15:46.528 --> 15:47.528
Okay, bye.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.507
- I love you girls so much.
- Love you.

15:49.531 --> 15:50.532
Love you.

15:52.576 --> 15:53.786
I can't wait to be a mother.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.581
- Go away. Get out of here.
- So weird. Go away.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.710
- How's everybody doing?
- Excited.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.671
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Uhm,

16:03.754 --> 16:06.507
Chloe hasn't heard from NYU yet,
so that's a bummer.

16:06.757 --> 16:09.468
Yeah, but I mean, wasn't she feeling
really good about UCSB?

16:09.551 --> 16:14.014
No. Us, going to school together,
near each other, that is part of the plan.

16:14.890 --> 16:17.476
Okay, my little cruise director.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.228
- It is.
- Okay.

16:20.145 --> 16:22.690
- Sorry.
- Okay. Okay.

16:23.899 --> 16:26.860
- What's this? What are you writing?
- Oh. No, that's, uh...

16:27.820 --> 16:29.029
it's for Clo.

16:29.989 --> 16:34.952
Tomorrow's Thomas' 19th birthday.
So, I just had some nice things planned.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.164
Do you wanna talk about it?

16:40.582 --> 16:41.583
I'm fine.

16:43.168 --> 16:46.088
It's gonna be a tough day, for everybody.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.814
You know,
he would have hated this shrine.

18:27.648 --> 18:33.112
"Don't be such a sad sack, mom. Turn it
into a pool room or a sex dungeon."

18:35.489 --> 18:36.490
Hmm.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.202
It's not
how it's supposed to be.

18:42.079 --> 18:43.205
I know.

18:44.248 --> 18:45.874
But it's how it is, mom.

18:54.091 --> 18:56.885
We, we could do something later, maybe.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.931
Yeah. Yeah.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.696
Top of the morning, Jerry.
You wanted to see me?

19:17.823 --> 19:19.324
So, how you doing?

19:20.409 --> 19:21.409
Great.

19:22.077 --> 19:23.245
A little wound-up lately?

19:24.413 --> 19:26.248
Uh, it's kind of my default.

19:27.124 --> 19:30.919
Okay. So, I wanted to talk to you about
some prom stuff before Student Council.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.547
I wanna talk to you about delegating.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.426
- You suck at it.
- Don't do this to me, Jerry. Don't do it.

19:37.509 --> 19:40.220
You know who...
- And just because it hasn't worked before,

19:41.054 --> 19:42.514
doesn't mean it never will.

19:43.515 --> 19:48.275
People can be there, if you let them. You have to share
this process, you have to share it with Student Council,

19:49.938 --> 19:52.498
especially with Noah, because
it looks like he's gonna be the one

19:52.524 --> 19:53.650
taking over next year.

19:54.151 --> 19:58.530
Okay. A wise man once told me, "The world
begins when I'm born and ends when I die."

19:59.031 --> 20:02.075
And I really feel that that applies
to my tenure here. So, let's just,

20:02.159 --> 20:04.578
you know, let that one marinate
and then we can circle back.

20:06.788 --> 20:08.290
That doesn't make any sense.

20:09.124 --> 20:14.804
My buddy was in jail at San Quentin. He was jonesing for some blow.
Uh, those days I had a pretty good arm. So, I loaded up a tennis ball

20:19.551 --> 20:25.224
with some grade A quality snow,
hurled it over the wall.

20:25.849 --> 20:26.975
It worked out great.

20:27.643 --> 20:31.355
Okay. Let's get started
with those drug presentations.

20:31.438 --> 20:34.316
- PCP?
- I have to go to the bathroom.

20:34.816 --> 20:38.487
- Uhm, can it wait?
- If you want a bloody beanbag.

20:41.990 --> 20:46.328
Menstruation is a miracle. I'm jealous
that I can't experience it myself.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.414
Take your time.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.337
All right. Who's ready? Angel dust?

21:26.952 --> 21:29.329
<i>Hey, Clo, you still at Lil's?</i>

21:29.788 --> 21:32.791
<i>I'm, uh, I'm gonna swing by
and get you girls in 30.</i>

21:32.916 --> 21:35.127
<i>I love you.
I'll call you when I'm outside.</i>

21:42.467 --> 21:44.720
<i>Hey, Clo, you still at Lil's?</i>

21:45.304 --> 21:48.223
<i>I'm, uh, I'm gonna swing by
and get you girls in 30.</i>

21:48.348 --> 21:50.642
<i>I love you.
I'll call you when I'm outside.</i>

21:53.061 --> 21:54.896
<i>Hey, Clo, you still at Lil's?</i>

21:55.897 --> 21:58.608
<i>I'm, uh, I'm gonna swing by
and get you girls in 30.</i>

21:59.276 --> 22:01.236
<i>I love you.
I'll call you when I'm outside.</i>

22:14.666 --> 22:16.543
Clo. Clo.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.921
- Hey.
- Hey. I took the liberty.

22:21.006 --> 22:23.216
- Is class over?
- Yeah.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.304
- Thank you.
- No problem.

22:36.354 --> 22:37.354
It was a hard day.

22:40.692 --> 22:41.692
Here.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.323
To Thomas,

22:48.200 --> 22:50.744
who showed us that

22:51.870 --> 22:54.790
you can be smart,

22:56.166 --> 23:00.629
athletic, kind, and...

23:01.713 --> 23:04.216
fucking high all at the same time.

23:05.592 --> 23:06.885
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

23:17.979 --> 23:19.231
You want me to get Lil?

23:20.273 --> 23:24.486
No, it's okay. She's off saving the world,
one prom at a time.

23:26.363 --> 23:27.363
Yeah.

23:30.075 --> 23:33.078
Well, you know, uhm, speaking of prom...

23:34.287 --> 23:35.287
Uhm...

23:37.040 --> 23:40.168
I was a little worried that

23:40.669 --> 23:43.713
you might think I was just, like,
fucking around earlier.

23:45.215 --> 23:50.428
Definitely. I'd really like to go
with you, if you're into it?

23:50.804 --> 23:53.284
I don't know about your face.
I don't know if you would. But...

23:53.390 --> 23:54.850
No, I have this, uhm...

23:56.601 --> 23:59.938
I have this pre-frosh thing
at UCSB this weekend.

24:00.021 --> 24:01.106
-No. That's, that's chill.

24:01.189 --> 24:02.917
- I totally get that.
- No. No. No. No. I'm not saying that.

24:02.941 --> 24:07.070
I don't, I don't know
if I'm gonna go to that or not, uhm,

24:07.988 --> 24:10.282
but if I don't go,
I'd love to go to prom with you.

24:11.241 --> 24:12.868
Well you should then. Cool.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.705
<i>So Jerry will make</i>

24:16.788 --> 24:19.666
an announcement
and then it'll be girls' soccer,

24:19.749 --> 24:20.876
led by yours truly.

24:20.959 --> 24:25.213
Then it'll be boys' soccer,
though I really object to that order,

24:25.297 --> 24:27.924
but then we'll both celebrate
our crushing victories.

24:28.008 --> 24:29.759
Okay. Prom?

24:34.598 --> 24:39.019
I really need your guys' help on this.
So Noah...

24:39.269 --> 24:42.105
will you check the rates
at these catering companies?

24:42.647 --> 24:47.319
Uhm, try Alphonso at Café Food,
just let me know if you need any help.

24:47.402 --> 24:49.842
You know what, I can actually, I can...

24:52.115 --> 24:56.745
Noah, uh, are there some
agenda issues you'd like to address?

24:58.038 --> 25:01.750
So, there are many things
that are important for prom,

25:01.833 --> 25:05.879
but the most important thing,
is, uh, your date.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.842
Hmm. What's going on?

25:28.902 --> 25:32.781

26:15.782 --> 26:18.222
Okay. Email tonight,
meeting adjourned, thank you guys.

26:19.661 --> 26:22.580
Look, I know I'm no Heath Ledger,
but I know you like big gestures so...

26:22.664 --> 26:25.792
Prom is my prom date
and it should be yours too.

26:29.921 --> 26:32.173
<i>I mean, dude, the ukulele...</i>

26:32.674 --> 26:35.051
Seriously? Have some self-respect.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.470
Yeah, but he planned
the whole thing though.

26:37.846 --> 26:38.846
Pretty fucking cute.

26:40.265 --> 26:41.516
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:41.641 --> 26:45.645
- Hey.
- Guys, I just had a serious CRAFT moment.

26:45.937 --> 26:48.708
What did you play, Light as a feather,
stiff as a board? I love that game.

26:48.732 --> 26:52.277
No. So I was sitting in the library,
and guess who walks in.

27:01.328 --> 27:05.040
- Hey. Rebecca.
- Hey. What's up?

27:05.457 --> 27:07.542
- A little light reading I see?
- Yeah.

27:07.625 --> 27:10.128
My parents never done one,
so I'm just trying to sort through

27:10.211 --> 27:12.630
and this one's my personal reading.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.759
Ah, well, uh,

27:16.801 --> 27:20.430
you know, sometimes
there's just no reason at all

27:21.723 --> 27:24.934
- and there's nothing pure about it.
- Yeah.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.479
Right.

27:29.606 --> 27:31.483
I'll just, uh, you know,

27:31.775 --> 27:33.495
- finish the shift.
- Yeah, nice seeing you.

- Hey.
- Hey.

29:05.368 --> 29:06.661
The water hot enough for you?

29:09.247 --> 29:13.918
Have you ever masturbated to completion
next to a total stranger before?

29:15.879 --> 29:17.088
Bemis is hot.

29:19.048 --> 29:22.218
but in my fantasy,
it's Gore Vidal and Trent Reznor.

29:29.893 --> 29:31.186
Is that fucking crazy?

29:31.644 --> 29:33.354
Wait. So she knew you were masturbating?

29:33.438 --> 29:35.565
She knew who I was fantasizing about.

29:35.648 --> 29:38.127
I masturbate at school all the time,
it's a great burst of energy.

29:38.151 --> 29:40.236
It totally focuses and relaxes you.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.222
I'm never holding your hand again.

29:43.239 --> 29:47.619
Okay. So, if you send a sext
to somebody and they text you back,

29:47.702 --> 29:50.830
"O period K period", what do you reply?

29:51.664 --> 29:52.916
Aaron Jakes is a douche.

29:53.708 --> 29:55.068
Have you seen him again?

29:55.210 --> 29:57.378
Just a few times,
late night at his house,

29:57.462 --> 29:59.881
younger boy throwdown,
they do what you say.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.300
Hm. Unless they turn you down.

30:03.927 --> 30:07.305
Anyway, indifference
is the greatest aphrodisiac.

30:07.472 --> 30:10.767
Yup, because Iceberg Slim said,
"You can't need the pussy."

30:11.518 --> 30:12.727
And who is Iceberg Slim?

30:12.811 --> 30:15.188
A great writer and renowned pimp.

30:15.647 --> 30:18.983
- How did the meeting go, Meils?
- Dude, divorce stuff sucks.

30:19.818 --> 30:24.405
My dad refuses to give Rosa benefits,
but then I see him and he gives me this.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.115
That's fucking suck.

30:27.242 --> 30:29.244
It's just such a fucking letdown,
you know.

30:31.454 --> 30:33.581
And this bracelet's
like really fucking tacky.

30:34.165 --> 30:37.252
- You should tell him it upsets you.
- No, you can't. He's a dick.

30:37.710 --> 30:39.254
You might as well enjoy the perks.

30:40.171 --> 30:41.714
I fucked up my eyeliner.

30:43.299 --> 30:44.467
- This corner.
- Yeah.

30:44.801 --> 30:46.511
Okay. So...

30:47.136 --> 30:48.596
I have a little something.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.518
It's Thomas' favorite.

31:03.403 --> 31:04.403
Oh.

31:10.201 --> 31:14.956
<i>♪ Happy birthday dear Thomas ♪</i>

31:16.249 --> 31:20.128
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

31:28.344 --> 31:30.346
Okay. To Thomas. All right.
Here we go, all right.

31:31.055 --> 31:32.575
That was the one, good cake.

31:33.933 --> 31:34.976
Very good cake.

31:35.393 --> 31:36.728
Taxi's here bellas.

31:37.312 --> 31:41.482
All right ladies, let's throw on
some slutty dresses and get fucked up.

31:42.358 --> 31:44.628
- Is that what you're wearing?
- Yeah, I'm over it.

31:44.652 --> 31:49.240
<i>♪ Give me my shot, give me my shot
Give me my shot, keep calm ♪</i>

31:49.324 --> 31:53.745
<i>♪ Give me my shot, give me my shot
Give me my shot, keep calm ♪</i>

31:53.828 --> 31:58.416
<i>♪ Give me my shot, give me my shot
Give me my shot, keep calm ♪</i>

31:59.334 --> 32:01.628
All right. Let's get schwatsy faced,

32:02.045 --> 32:04.923
zanzi-bars? Shrooms?
I don't care, whatever, I'll get weird.

32:05.465 --> 32:09.010
I'm gonna grab that blunt
from the Travises. Travis!

32:14.307 --> 32:15.307
Oh.

32:21.314 --> 32:23.441
Okay. I'm, I'll go to the bathroom.

32:29.113 --> 32:31.115
A lot of Wagner biographies.

32:33.284 --> 32:34.535
You go to Catcher High?

32:37.622 --> 32:38.622
That's a bummer.

32:38.831 --> 32:40.917
Uh-hmm. You a Path girl?

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Hmm.

32:45.463 --> 32:46.756
Enjoy yourself.

32:47.340 --> 32:48.549
Yeah, you too.

32:50.635 --> 32:52.178
Psst. Madame President?

32:53.388 --> 32:54.597
What the fuck?

33:00.687 --> 33:03.022
Were you waiting out here
for me with a joint?

33:03.398 --> 33:06.567
I was. Uh, it's an apology joint.

33:06.651 --> 33:11.739
No. I should apologize.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.826
You were really sweet. I was...

33:15.868 --> 33:17.537
I was a really big bitch, I'm sorry.

33:17.620 --> 33:20.373
No. You weren't a bitch, you weren't.

33:20.456 --> 33:23.501
I, it's, most guys look so cool to you

33:23.626 --> 33:28.464
and I thought that I would join the ranks
of those great uke players, but, uhm...

33:29.048 --> 33:31.426
I found out
that I'm not one of those guys,

33:32.301 --> 33:35.263
and I feel really bad
that I embarrassed you, I, I didn't...

33:37.265 --> 33:38.891
- I'm just not that kind of girl.
- Yeah.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.977
- Yeah. Uhm, and, and plus,
- Okay.

33:41.728 --> 33:43.271
I already have dates.

33:44.230 --> 33:45.523
I thought prom was your date?

33:47.358 --> 33:50.778
Well, the girls and I
were probably gonna go together.

33:51.362 --> 33:54.866
Yeah, but, I mean, who are they
gonna dance with during slow songs?

33:55.825 --> 33:58.995
You'll be the one running shit,
they can't dance with you.

33:59.912 --> 34:03.875
Besides, I thought it might be nice
if you have someone to give you their coat

34:03.958 --> 34:04.958
if you get cold.

34:07.003 --> 34:08.803
Fuck. I'm a bitch.
That would be nice. You...

34:13.259 --> 34:17.804
You're so nice, you are. It's just,
I have a lot of things...

34:25.480 --> 34:27.023
I'm not that nice.

34:38.201 --> 34:40.745
Okay. So, let's just hold our horses.

34:40.828 --> 34:42.264
- I'm here with my girls.
- Oh, no. No. No. Don't...

34:42.288 --> 34:45.291
Look, it's dark outside,
you're probably really drunk,

34:45.373 --> 34:47.226
I could be anyone to you.
So, if we're gonna do this,

34:47.251 --> 34:48.293
you need to come over

34:49.504 --> 34:51.589
in the afternoon,
it's much better lighting.

34:51.672 --> 34:52.672
Give me your phone.

34:58.888 --> 35:01.766
You are really fucking nice. Thank you.

35:02.600 --> 35:03.600
- See you.
- Bye.

35:03.851 --> 35:05.978
Bye. Thank you.

35:09.690 --> 35:10.817
Fuck yeah.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.781
Well, this is fucking cute.

35:17.156 --> 35:20.660
Meanwhile, my chocolate chunk prom date
is over there feeling on some

35:20.743 --> 35:22.495
just-started-birth-control-titties.

35:22.870 --> 35:26.749
Fuck Aaron Jakes
and screw that tiny Tinkerbell cunt.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.876
I mean, what are we gonna do
about tree next year?

35:29.252 --> 35:31.372
That East Coast weed
is some schwag-ass shit.

35:31.838 --> 35:35.716
I feel like we're gonna be doing,
like, cool, like, brooding winter drugs,

35:36.008 --> 35:37.260
like, opium,

35:37.718 --> 35:38.718
you know?

35:39.303 --> 35:41.889
Chloe? Earth to Chloe.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.306
What's up?

35:45.101 --> 35:46.102
I, uhm,

35:48.646 --> 35:50.356
I got into NYU this morning.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.199
- You better fucking stop.
- Oh, my God.

35:53.234 --> 35:54.318
- Dude?
- Really?

35:54.944 --> 35:56.464
- Hm-mmm.
- What? What's wrong?

35:56.863 --> 35:57.905
You love Ol' West City.

35:58.990 --> 36:03.870
I think I wanna go to UCSB,
like, be close to my mom and stuff.

36:04.787 --> 36:06.205
Have you to talked to Lil?

36:06.831 --> 36:09.500
Oh, sorry, excuse me. Hey.

36:11.252 --> 36:15.339
Hey. They attached a trash bag
to a vaporizer, it's fucking dope, hit it.

36:19.135 --> 36:20.775
Wait, what happened to your lip?

36:22.805 --> 36:24.015
Younger boy throwdown?

36:24.557 --> 36:25.725
You fought a little boy?

36:26.392 --> 36:27.392
Mmm. Yeah.

36:28.352 --> 36:30.730
- What? Did I miss something?
- ...are star people.

36:33.482 --> 36:36.194
Oh, my God, something’s off
in PussTown USA. I'm so sorry.

36:36.694 --> 36:42.116
Uh, ah, Chloe, I know I said get weird
and do shrooms and shit,

36:42.200 --> 36:44.577
maybe, maybe you're getting
a little too weird?

36:44.994 --> 36:48.372
There's nothing weird about
just hanging with your prom date.

36:50.791 --> 36:53.252
But hold on,
what about those shrooms, though?

36:53.502 --> 36:55.713
It's disgusting,
there's splash everywhere.

36:57.965 --> 36:58.965
Damn it.

37:05.681 --> 37:07.475
Cops, cops with dogs.

37:07.558 --> 37:09.101
Shit. Go. Go.

37:09.435 --> 37:12.688
- Ah. Becks. Where's Becks? Where...
- Find her. Find her, meet me outside, go.

37:12.772 --> 37:15.608
Got a little roof on there. A little roof.

37:36.587 --> 37:38.172
Oh, what the...

37:39.257 --> 37:42.343
Ah! Ah! What the fuck! Really?

37:42.802 --> 37:44.238
- Becks.
- Becks? Becks.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.931
- No.
- Cops, cops, cops. Come on.

37:47.139 --> 37:49.141
Guys, I pulled out two tampons.

37:49.558 --> 37:51.269
- Dude, gross.
- I know.

37:51.394 --> 37:53.771
- How long were they in there?
- One was mummified.

37:53.854 --> 37:55.648
- So, they're like all...
- Yeah.

37:56.399 --> 37:57.650
- Like a loom.
- No.

37:57.733 --> 37:59.902
Like Penelope fighting off suitors.

38:01.904 --> 38:03.656
Okay. Come on, we got to go. Come on.

38:07.368 --> 38:09.328
All right.
Party's over, let's go.

38:10.413 --> 38:12.133
Where are you ladies going?

38:13.541 --> 38:15.167
- Uhm...
- Yeah?

38:15.710 --> 38:19.297
Our friend Rebecca here
just had two tampons inside of her,

38:19.380 --> 38:21.215
and it was quite a struggle
to get them out.

38:23.175 --> 38:25.761
Maybe you, you have a, a daughter

38:25.845 --> 38:28.222
and you know how difficult tampons
can be sometimes.

38:29.598 --> 38:31.976
Yeah. She's got a point.
Nora just turned 13.

38:32.059 --> 38:34.162
I spent an hour outside the bathroom
yelling through the door,

38:34.186 --> 38:36.522
"Just shove it up there." Tampons.

38:37.398 --> 38:41.152
All right, ladies, that's it, come on,
party's over. Let's go. Be safe. Come on.

38:42.069 --> 38:44.655
Thank you, officers. Thank you.

38:45.281 --> 38:46.641
- Anyone else?
- Oh, oh, oh.

38:46.866 --> 38:49.201
There is this book,
it's called <i>It's Perfectly Normal,</i>

38:49.285 --> 38:52.163
it talks about everything
from discharge to tampons,

38:52.538 --> 38:54.498
you should really check it out.
Thank you so much.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.961
That's the most times
I’ve heard the word tampon ever.

38:59.545 --> 39:00.880
Did she just say discharge?

39:03.674 --> 39:07.303
Hey.
Croissants to soak up the poison

39:07.386 --> 39:09.055
that is rotting in your stomachs.

39:09.138 --> 39:11.390
Oh, Mr. Bemis loves croissants.

39:12.224 --> 39:15.561
I feel like your period
is punctuated by two huge dumps,

39:15.770 --> 39:19.065
- one at the beginning and one at the end.
- Oh, we're synched. Mc-lin-tock.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.116
Yeah, I'm just happy,
I won’t have it at prom.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.820
Oh, yeah, which apparently
you are going to with Sam,

39:24.945 --> 39:29.116
- that's a subtle ditch, Judas.
- Oh, your face. I can’t. Too hung over.

39:29.408 --> 39:30.408
Where's the tree?

39:31.494 --> 39:33.496
I think we’re Treeless in Seattle.

39:34.121 --> 39:36.332
- Not even One Tree Hill?
- Nothing.

39:36.624 --> 39:39.752
All I’ve got are these weird
weed mint strips.

39:40.336 --> 39:41.128
Those even work?

39:41.212 --> 39:43.714
I don't know, we’ll see.
Either have really fresh breath

39:45.091 --> 39:46.091
or we'll be really high.

39:48.094 --> 39:49.094
Cheers.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.665
- Cheers bitches.
- Mazel tov.

39:53.933 --> 39:57.853
<i>I Am Legend</i> is how it will happen.
Someone will invent a cure for cancer

39:58.020 --> 40:00.439
and the vaccine will make everyone
a zombie brain-eater.

40:01.065 --> 40:02.691
<i>I Am Legend</i> ?

40:03.651 --> 40:04.651
Okay...

40:05.194 --> 40:10.616
Would you rather have penises for fingers
or vaginas for ears?

40:10.699 --> 40:12.743
Hmm, do the penises get hard?

40:13.786 --> 40:14.870
Yes.

40:14.954 --> 40:17.123
Okay. But like can you control them
when they're hard?

40:17.206 --> 40:21.001
The thing with dick fingers,
is that you cannot wear rings,

40:21.419 --> 40:24.213
but if you have vaginal ears,
you can wear earrings.

40:24.380 --> 40:25.381
Like bling?

40:25.756 --> 40:27.341
- Like Vling.
- Vling.

40:29.218 --> 40:31.637
Wait, wait, wait, wait, girl,
listen, listen, listen.

40:31.929 --> 40:34.056
Yeah, what's up? Okay. What if

40:34.140 --> 40:36.392
you have dick fingers and vagina ears?

40:36.934 --> 40:37.934
- Oh.
- Yeah.

40:39.145 --> 40:43.399
Like, oh,
like I've literally fucked my brains out.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.401
I've got brains coming out of my nose

40:45.901 --> 40:49.363
and jizz all over my head
and I haven't even made dinner yet.

40:49.822 --> 40:51.240
I'm making hamburger helpers.

40:51.323 --> 40:52.323
Eww.

40:52.908 --> 40:54.743
- Liv!
- Liv!

40:54.827 --> 40:57.139
- Oh yeah. Here's my baby sister!
- There she is.

40:57.163 --> 40:59.415
Wait, Liv, you’re in sixth grade?

40:59.707 --> 41:01.625
- Yeah?
- Dude,

41:01.709 --> 41:03.711
- my boobs were so big at sixth grade.
- That is...

41:03.794 --> 41:05.713
Yeah. That is the best fucking year,

41:05.796 --> 41:07.274
- it's gonna be the best year of your life.
- I hope not.

41:07.298 --> 41:08.442
- I promise.
- I hope you're the best.

41:08.466 --> 41:09.508
I promise.

41:10.009 --> 41:14.138
Oh no. Lil, I think Stella
ate your breath strips.

41:16.265 --> 41:18.100
Oh, Stella.

41:19.727 --> 41:21.228
You guys really like fresh breath.

41:22.229 --> 41:23.397
Stella.

41:24.857 --> 41:26.233
How are you feeling girl?

41:26.901 --> 41:28.402
Trippin' balls...

41:28.486 --> 41:30.696
Huge, sweaty balls...

41:31.489 --> 41:33.616
You're gonna get through this.

41:34.200 --> 41:36.076
I don't know man...

41:36.202 --> 41:39.788
Oh. Her breath smells like someone
hot boxed a toothpaste factory.

41:41.499 --> 41:44.502
Prom tickets, 15 dollars.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.087
Seriously guys, they're 15 bucks.

41:47.213 --> 41:49.048
Okay. After party tickets,

41:49.131 --> 41:51.800
Forty bucks apiece. Leggo.

41:52.801 --> 41:54.845
This is bullshit,
why do they want your tickets?

41:55.179 --> 41:58.474
Look, after Party is more important
than prom, all right?

41:58.557 --> 42:03.145
Prom is just an excuse for girls
to get fancy dresses and fake tans.

42:04.188 --> 42:07.983
And to make memories

42:08.067 --> 42:11.820
in a beautiful atmosphere,
all right, expertly created

42:11.904 --> 42:14.657
- by dedicated Student Council members.
- Hm-mmm.

42:15.449 --> 42:17.243
Look, you care too much. They smell it.

42:18.244 --> 42:21.097
Look, wanting people to be happy
and have a good time, that's a bad thing?

42:21.121 --> 42:24.291
No, it's just letting people
have a good time is better.

42:25.793 --> 42:26.793
Thank you.

42:28.045 --> 42:30.881
Look, you know, it’s fine
that you asked Chloe to prom,

42:30.965 --> 42:33.246
but you should've talked to me first.
What about bro code?

42:33.509 --> 42:34.986
I’m sorry. I didn’t want to upset you,

42:35.010 --> 42:36.845
- okay?
- Whatever. It's cool.

42:37.513 --> 42:40.933
I mean, I guess if she's not gonna go
with me, you’re the next best thing.

42:41.392 --> 42:42.560
All right. We good?

42:42.810 --> 42:43.644
Yeah, we're cool.

42:43.727 --> 42:45.354
- All right, thank you.
- All right.

42:47.314 --> 42:48.314
Oh, God.

42:48.357 --> 42:50.901
Meils. Meils, are you okay?

42:51.610 --> 42:54.488
I came here to give that
little piece of shit a piece of my mind.

42:54.572 --> 42:55.614
Piece of shit? Oh.

42:56.198 --> 42:58.993
Aaron Jakes. You know that little
taint-troll? Is he around here?

42:59.368 --> 43:02.246
All right, you know, you take that,
I'm gonna get this one home.

43:02.329 --> 43:03.689
- Please do.
- All right. Let's go.

43:04.415 --> 43:06.125
Oh, shit, better grab Liv, come on.

43:08.544 --> 43:09.628
Aaron?

43:14.049 --> 43:15.050
I love him.

43:21.265 --> 43:22.265
Liv...

43:23.142 --> 43:24.226
what’s wrong?

43:26.145 --> 43:28.373
I got in trouble, because James
wrote something really gross

43:28.397 --> 43:29.773
in my paper on governments.

43:30.065 --> 43:30.899
- What?
- James,

43:30.983 --> 43:32.985
he must've gone
on the computer when it was up.

43:33.235 --> 43:34.235
What did it say?

43:35.237 --> 43:37.323
In the paragraph on oligarchies it said,

43:37.406 --> 43:40.117
"I like to sneak in
and watch my dad take showers."

43:41.201 --> 43:42.453
It’s not funny.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.789
He’s so mean, it really hurts me.

43:46.206 --> 43:49.960
Older brothers are gonna make fun of you.
All right? That's just what they do.

43:50.252 --> 43:53.130
James just sees you as a kid right now,
soon enough you'll be friends.

43:53.672 --> 43:54.590
But seriously, you have to admit.

43:54.673 --> 43:56.925
"I sneak in and watch my dad
take showers", that's funny.

43:58.093 --> 44:00.304
Wait, who told you guys about that?

44:01.597 --> 44:04.808
Okay. That only happened once, okay?

44:05.142 --> 44:07.978
And Liv, it was really scary.
Never do it, okay?

44:08.937 --> 44:10.939
It's like,
it's like an angry sea monster.

44:15.361 --> 44:17.446
Hey, look, look,
I'll talk to James, all right?

44:17.529 --> 44:19.323
- All right.
- Okay. Love you.

44:19.573 --> 44:21.325
- Love you. Bye.
- Bye.

44:22.868 --> 44:23.744
-Bye, Liv.

44:23.827 --> 44:24.995
- Bye.
- Jesus.

44:27.831 --> 44:31.001
Ugh, fuck. I want froyo.

44:32.961 --> 44:34.338
Hey, do you think we’re fucked up,

44:34.421 --> 44:36.501
because of our fucked up relationships
with our dads?

44:37.174 --> 44:39.093
Uh, you don’t have a relationship
with your dad.

44:40.052 --> 44:41.095
You know what I mean.

44:42.638 --> 44:45.849
Well, yeah, I mean,
everyone's dad fucks them up.

44:45.933 --> 44:50.229
Like, I see my dad and I'm like,
fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

44:50.687 --> 44:56.235
But then, you know, I wanna see him
and I still want him to wanna see me.

44:56.318 --> 44:57.318
Yeah.

44:58.278 --> 45:00.406
I mean, I never felt like I needed mine.

45:00.948 --> 45:02.658
I always have my mom, I have you guys.

45:02.825 --> 45:07.079
Mmm, but either your dad fucks you up,
because he's not there

45:07.162 --> 45:09.415
or your dad fucks you up,
because he's there

45:09.498 --> 45:12.000
and honestly
nobody can live up to that shit.

45:12.334 --> 45:13.334
Right.

45:14.753 --> 45:17.034
But I guess, until then,
he's still gonna get laid, right?

45:18.006 --> 45:19.049
Yeah.

45:20.175 --> 45:21.935
Hey, dickwad,
can I talk to you for a second?

45:24.638 --> 45:26.974
Your little essay addition,

45:28.267 --> 45:29.707
you have anything to say about that?

45:33.647 --> 45:38.652
Oh! You're repulsive.
That is disgusting. God, dear God.

45:42.406 --> 45:43.406
Okay.

45:44.283 --> 45:46.761
You know how many peoples' games you just
ruined? Abdul’s gonna be pissed at me.

45:46.785 --> 45:48.787
Oh, cry me a river, Leroy Jenkins.

45:49.580 --> 45:50.622
Dude, this is serious.

45:50.956 --> 45:52.676
It's a joke.
She's not gonna get in trouble.

45:52.749 --> 45:54.668
No, it’s not about school, it’s about her.

45:55.210 --> 45:57.650
Poor thing, she thinks that you hate her.
She needs you. Look,

45:58.505 --> 46:01.625
we’re the only other people who know
what we’ve been through, all right? And...

46:02.885 --> 46:04.386
you know, pretty soon, your friends,

46:04.470 --> 46:05.822
they're gonna wanna bang her
and if you're not nicer,

46:05.846 --> 46:08.366
- she, she's probably gonna do it.
- Dude, don’t talk about my friends

46:08.390 --> 46:12.227
- fucking my baby sister.
- Look, you talked about her peep-holeing

46:12.311 --> 46:14.771
her own dad in writing,
in writing to her teacher.

46:15.105 --> 46:17.191
Uh, yeah, but that's funny,

46:17.274 --> 46:19.074
because we don't have a dad.

46:19.776 --> 46:20.819
Seriously?

46:21.737 --> 46:23.530
Noah
Hang? I'm nearby.

46:25.574 --> 46:27.826
- Where are you going?
- Read a book.

46:32.581 --> 46:34.374
And this is
where the magic happens.

46:34.833 --> 46:36.418
This is awesome.

46:36.502 --> 46:38.086
Thanks. How was your day?

46:38.754 --> 46:44.468
Uh, It was, it was good. Uhm, that guy Ken
was a dick in Academic Journal.

46:44.593 --> 46:47.179
There’s this like, this freshman girl...

46:48.347 --> 46:51.767
Oh, my God. This is really out of tune.
It's horrible.

46:52.392 --> 46:55.687
So there's this freshman girl who wears
those kind of like <i>risqué</i> stuff

46:55.771 --> 46:59.900
and he makes these gross comments about it
and she's so fucking schevvy like...

46:59.983 --> 47:04.655
Young male teachers have a hard time
handling a burgeoning young woman, so...

47:09.076 --> 47:12.496
Yes, well, you are very burgeoning.

47:12.871 --> 47:14.891
Look, I'll talk to him,
if he's got a problem with her,

47:14.915 --> 47:17.167
he should really
have a female counselor speak to her.

47:17.501 --> 47:20.462
I, uhm, I wasn't listening
to anything you just said.

47:20.921 --> 47:24.466
See, you would've missed all this
in the dark, drunken stupor of the party.

47:45.821 --> 47:47.864
- Hey, that just tickles.
- Yeah.

47:49.199 --> 47:50.199
I got it.

47:52.494 --> 47:53.495
Wow.

47:58.542 --> 47:59.585
Can I take these off?

48:01.295 --> 48:03.880
That is so hot that you asked,
yes, please, take them off.

48:12.681 --> 48:13.849
Okay. So, uhm...

48:14.433 --> 48:17.203
I'm gonna get really quiet, but it,
it's not that it doesn't feel good.

48:17.227 --> 48:18.812
It's, it's because that it does

48:18.895 --> 48:22.524
and I just wanna focus on that moaning.
It's too distracting.

48:28.697 --> 48:31.450
11 minutes later...

48:31.533 --> 48:33.577
Keep going. Right there, I'm gonna cum.

48:35.829 --> 48:36.829
Okay, wait.

48:41.877 --> 48:43.086
Are you fucking kidding me?

48:44.921 --> 48:45.921
Fuck me.

48:46.131 --> 48:47.131
Okay.

48:52.262 --> 48:53.347
You're fucking beautiful.

48:56.058 --> 48:58.268
Okay. Reciprocity.

48:59.561 --> 49:01.063
- What?
- Take these off.

49:09.738 --> 49:10.989
Oh, fuck.

49:13.033 --> 49:14.660
Look <i>moi</i>. No hands.

49:15.243 --> 49:16.244
That's awesome.

49:17.079 --> 49:18.079
Oh, fuck.

49:18.955 --> 49:20.916
Afternoon Delight is the best.

49:21.708 --> 49:22.918
- Hey.
- You're amazing.

49:23.168 --> 49:25.337
Yeah. Yeah, that was, that was awesome.

49:25.420 --> 49:28.215
I'm gonna... a lot of energy
for the game now. Thanks.

49:29.091 --> 49:32.135
Hey, so, uhm, listen. Would you ever
wanna come over to my house

49:32.636 --> 49:36.556
and, like, have dinner with my parents
and just, like, hang out with my family?

49:38.141 --> 49:44.773
Uhm, yeah, I, I would love to come over
and meet your parents as a mentor,

49:45.899 --> 49:50.487
guidance figure in your life. But, uhm,
I mean, they'll really like me

49:50.570 --> 49:55.450
and you'll like that and that's, that's,
that's just bad news for everyone, so...

49:55.826 --> 49:57.953
Well, well, I mean, I already like you.

49:58.745 --> 50:01.224
Like, I'm not trying to date you.
I, I know that you have to leave soon

50:01.248 --> 50:04.126
and my crazy ex would kill me if...

50:04.209 --> 50:05.228
What, the one from Catcher?

50:05.252 --> 50:06.932
Yeah. Yeah.
They're gonna play her tonight.

50:07.295 --> 50:10.149
You got to watch out. She got wind
of this and she's, she's really pissed.

50:10.173 --> 50:12.926
All right, ladies,
we want a good, clean game.

50:13.301 --> 50:14.970
Tough with these messy skanks.

50:15.679 --> 50:16.679
- Excuse me?
- Call it.

50:17.097 --> 50:18.765
- Heads.
- You would.

50:18.932 --> 50:21.226
- What does that even mean?
- Heads it is.

50:35.449 --> 50:36.908
Run that shit.

50:38.535 --> 50:39.953
Independent women.

50:40.871 --> 50:43.915
- You know, he was at my place last night.
- Well, that's cool. I'm a sharer.

50:44.124 --> 50:45.792
Stay away from him, cock goblin.

50:49.629 --> 50:50.629
Oh.

50:50.839 --> 50:51.840
Boo!

50:53.258 --> 50:55.427
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
- What the fuck?

50:55.844 --> 50:58.054
Ref, your voicemail box is full,
you missed the ball.

51:08.064 --> 51:12.152
No one's gonna go for that...

51:14.529 --> 51:15.572
Done, bitch.

51:16.698 --> 51:19.326
Keanu Reeves's mother
is actually Asian.

51:19.409 --> 51:21.578
So, that's why <i>The Matrix</i> is pretty
cool.

51:21.661 --> 51:25.248
Because, uh, some say it's based on
Baudrillard's <i>Simulacra and Simulation,</i>

51:25.332 --> 51:27.918
but he refuted the comparison.
It's not even a thing.

51:29.419 --> 51:31.797
I can't believe
what a raging bitch Noah's ex is.

51:31.880 --> 51:33.423
Guys like crazy girls.

51:34.007 --> 51:36.051
Yeah, I'm not getting involved
with that shit.

51:36.134 --> 51:39.930
I am not playing <i>The Boy is Mine</i>
my last week of senior year.

51:40.138 --> 51:42.015
Yo. You two right here?

51:42.682 --> 51:44.882
You two were too fucking amazing tonight.
You know that?

51:46.853 --> 51:48.647
Yeah. You know that moment
when you just know

51:48.730 --> 51:50.291
you're not gonna be
a professional athlete?

51:50.315 --> 51:52.317
- Hm-mmm.
- I kind of have one tonight.

51:52.400 --> 51:56.404
Mmm, well, that moment that you had,
comes a little later for black folk.

51:56.488 --> 51:58.615
Yes, but I get you though. I do.

51:58.740 --> 52:01.993
So, uhm, celebratory roll

52:02.285 --> 52:03.703
- for your victory, though?
- Ooh.

52:03.829 --> 52:06.081
- Where did you get this?
- You don't need to know.

52:06.832 --> 52:09.167
Okay, guys, seriously,
just, like, drink lots of water.

52:09.459 --> 52:12.188
- Stay hydrated, please.
- Let's see you on the other side.

52:12.212 --> 52:14.047
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

What?

53:41.217 --> 53:45.263
I don't know. Maybe this could be
like a good thing for us, have some space.

53:48.224 --> 53:49.476
What's up? Excuse us.

53:50.143 --> 53:54.814
This table is like, you know,
it's not tight, you know.

53:56.232 --> 53:58.026
It's, it's, like, too confined.

53:59.486 --> 54:02.530
You know, it's too tight.
I don't know what I'm fucking saying.

54:02.989 --> 54:04.991
Let's dance. Let's do that.

54:05.283 --> 54:11.748
Dude, I love you, okay?
Let's not let this ruin our trip, okay?

54:12.499 --> 54:14.084
- Talk about it tomorrow?
- Hm-mmm.

55:30.660 --> 55:31.661
Are you okay?

55:31.828 --> 55:33.705
I feel like my heart's gonna explode.

55:35.248 --> 55:38.084
Uhm, what hurts you?

55:39.461 --> 55:41.880
I got pain in my chest,
a raging fire in my stomach,

55:41.963 --> 55:45.175
and a desire to kill someone
and die at the same time.

55:46.634 --> 55:48.261
Are you allergic to gluten?

55:51.598 --> 55:54.100
Hi, I, uh, I'm Mike.

55:55.143 --> 55:56.436
- Yeah.
- We met at the...

55:57.103 --> 56:00.648
Yeah, yeah, I remember. Uhm, Lily. Sorry.

56:01.024 --> 56:04.694
Uhm, whatever it is you're mad about,
I'm sure it's not that bad.

56:07.697 --> 56:09.282
Or maybe it is. Okay.

Hey, do you wanna go out somewhere,
like, it's a little bit quieter?

56:20.085 --> 56:22.045
Would you go upstairs with me?
Can we go upstairs?

56:22.796 --> 56:24.756
- Absolutely.
- Great.

56:49.155 --> 56:53.326
Man, you are sexy. Fuck.

56:54.285 --> 56:55.285
Uhm...

56:56.496 --> 56:59.791
Those are for a balloon party.
We're not, we're not having sex.

57:00.166 --> 57:01.626
Uh-huh. Yeah.

57:23.606 --> 57:25.567
Oh, my God, you're so wet.

57:31.656 --> 57:33.700
- Oh!
- Whoa, dude...

57:34.409 --> 57:37.370
Okay, that was really...
that was really tricky.

57:37.454 --> 57:40.039
- Mike, stop. Mike, stop.
- Hold on.

57:40.248 --> 57:42.928
- Hold on, I'm gonna come. I'm gonna come.
- Mike. Get off. Get off.

58:05.190 --> 58:06.608
Can I have my underwear, please?

59:09.754 --> 59:12.006
- No.
- You look really bad, Lil.

59:13.550 --> 59:16.427
Have you seen Chloe
or Amelia or Becks anywhere?

59:16.511 --> 59:19.222
I'm pretty sure they all left.
I saw them walking outside.

59:19.889 --> 59:22.225
- They left?
- Yeah. Sorry.

01:00:01.347 --> 01:00:03.707
I'm headed to Moreno Street.

01:00:23.202 --> 01:00:25.955
Oh! My face hurts.

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:29.584
Morning sluts.

01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:32.670
Hey, are you okay?

01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:37.884
Oh, sorry about the leaving confusion.

01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:41.169
We couldn't find you for hours and then
Alicia the Cunt said you'd already left.

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:43.306
Yeah, what the fuck happened?

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:46.570
We couldn't find you. Your phone was off.
We were in the tree house.

01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:47.806
Yeah, what happened to you?

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:52.010
Last night was really fucked up.

01:00:52.523 --> 01:00:56.361
- Yeah, we're pretty fucked up, right?
- No, you guys were fucked up to me.

01:00:58.571 --> 01:00:59.923
Guess you wanted
to get it in with Sam now,

01:00:59.947 --> 01:01:01.115
since you can't at prom, huh?

01:01:02.533 --> 01:01:05.119
- Why are you acting like this?
- I'm just trying to be honest.

01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:09.999
Chloe is not going to prom.
Chloe is going to orientation at UCSB.

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:15.420
You guys knew?

01:01:17.256 --> 01:01:18.091
I had a feeling.

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:22.303
I hadn't heard from NYU,
UCSB was sounding like the smart option,

01:01:22.595 --> 01:01:24.222
Lil. Maybe the thing that I wanna do.

01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:27.600
Oh, you hadn't heard?
And, and now you know, right?

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:32.021
And you didn't tell me?

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:34.857
I didn't wanna say anything
before prom and ruin anything.

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:37.568
Ruin anything?
What about our fucking lives, Clo?

01:01:37.652 --> 01:01:40.405
- Calm down, Lily. This is good for us.
- Yeah. Yeah. This is great.

01:01:40.488 --> 01:01:43.282
Let's all just be alone,
that's a great way to go through life.

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:47.245
You know what?
Last night was a little preview.

01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:49.142
You are fucked up and you're confused

01:01:49.622 --> 01:01:51.975
and you're feeling all sorts
of new emotions and then all of a sudden,

01:01:51.999 --> 01:01:54.239
you're in a dark room
with some sweaty guy on top of you,

01:01:54.293 --> 01:01:55.521
- but none of your friends will care,
- What?

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:56.462
because none of your friends
are gonna be there

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.399
and you're gonna be
absolutely fucking on your own.

01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:01.143
- What happened to you last night?
- What happened?

01:02:02.301 --> 01:02:04.762
Nothing. A guy was...

01:02:05.638 --> 01:02:08.182
was goal-oriented,
it was shitty. I'm fine,

01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:10.435
but you guys ditched me
and that is not fine.

01:02:10.518 --> 01:02:12.918
Lily, you went off
with some dude and didn't tell us?

01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:16.083
- That's not our fault, Lil. We're...
- That's easy for you to say,

01:02:16.107 --> 01:02:17.251
you're turning your back on us.

01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:19.795
What are you, you think
you're gonna find some new best friends?

01:02:20.278 --> 01:02:22.238
What? I owe you,
so I can't make any new friends?

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:27.936
All, I'm just saying, like,

01:02:29.287 --> 01:02:31.706
how could you be friends
with someone who didn't know Thomas?

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.042
Are you fucking serious?

01:02:36.043 --> 01:02:38.588
I can't be friends with anyone
who didn't know my dead brother?

01:02:40.214 --> 01:02:41.614
Jesus fucking Christ, Lily.

01:02:41.674 --> 01:02:44.218
He didn't die
so we could be best friends forever.

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:46.697
We can still all be best friends.

01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:49.849
- Yeah.
- No. No, because she is fucking up

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:51.392
the friend ecosystem.

01:02:52.143 --> 01:02:54.353
Like, I'm the glue here, but without Clo,

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:57.023
your boy crazy ass
is gonna be with some dude.

01:02:57.106 --> 01:02:58.459
Your fuckin' head
is gonna be in the clouds.

01:02:58.483 --> 01:03:00.586
Yeah, my head's in the clouds,
because I’m, like, worrying about

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:03.738
paying for loans and school and shit
that's never even entered your mind.

01:03:03.821 --> 01:03:07.784
Yeah, and I'm boy crazy?
Guys drive you fucking nuts, dude.

01:03:08.117 --> 01:03:12.997
Look, you don't deal. Your dad is gone.
The guy that you were in love with, died.

01:03:14.165 --> 01:03:16.918
- I'm sorry for the truth bomb.
- You know what?

01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:19.003
Lil, I'm just thinking about it.

01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:22.673
Every guy you've loved, has left.

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:27.512
Okay, fuck! Fuck. I'm not trying
to psychoanalyze myself right now.

01:03:34.101 --> 01:03:35.812
- I'm outta here.
- This is your house.

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:37.522
Yeah, make yourself at fucking home.

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:42.985
This is an awkward moment,
but I feel like, uh, I have a coffee date,

01:03:43.402 --> 01:03:45.404
potential roommate situation.
Could you drive me?

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:46.965
- I got you.
- Okay.

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:49.617
Okay. She's gonna go. That was fucked up.

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:52.786
Come on. Let's go.

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:56.082
Hey. Lil.

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:02.088
What the fuck is going on with you?

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:04.251
I can't believe
you don't wanna go to school with me.

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:07.009
and I seriously cannot believe
that you lied to me about it.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:10.304
This is fucking bullshit. You are
too smart to be acting this pathetic.

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:13.033
You clearly don't understand at all

01:04:13.057 --> 01:04:15.494
- where I'm coming from.
- No, clearly you don't understand.

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:20.898
All your cherishing every moment and prom
and your weird fucking memorials.

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:23.794
Since Thomas died, you've gone
into overdrive. It's fucking oppressive.

01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:25.695
Yeah, this terrible thing happened

01:04:25.778 --> 01:04:28.298
and I'm just trying to get us through it.
I'm trying to make it better.

01:04:28.322 --> 01:04:30.408
Yeah, this terrible thing happened,

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:34.412
but it doesn't mean everything else
has to be peachy fucking keen, Lily.

01:04:34.787 --> 01:04:36.497
Meils' parents still suck,

01:04:36.998 --> 01:04:39.417
Becks still has to worry about money,
your dad is still gone,

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:42.962
I still have to deal with the gaping
fucking hole that's left in my family.

01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:47.091
- Life is hard and it keeps being hard.
- Clo, I know that.

01:04:49.135 --> 01:04:50.970
This has been really tough for me, too.

01:04:51.262 --> 01:04:53.389
- Oh, my God.
- And every time I try to talk to you

01:04:53.806 --> 01:04:55.576
- about it...
- Okay, but we are different, Lil.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.394
- Our shit is different.
- Yeah. I miss him, too.

01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:06.444
Okay. Well, you know what?
Sometimes you don't get to tell me that.

01:05:08.237 --> 01:05:10.031
You’re right, I, I'm not blood,

01:05:11.198 --> 01:05:12.909
but he was something else for me.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.953
Dude, whatever you thought he was,

01:05:16.662 --> 01:05:20.082
- he was actually my brother.
- Dude, I know.

01:05:26.714 --> 01:05:29.175
And I, I, was, I was trying
to make this time special.

01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:33.155
All right? I was trying to make our future special,
because, Clo, I don't know what I would do if I lost you.

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:35.139
Stop. Stop.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:41.228
Oh, my God, I can't...
with this psycho girlfriend act.

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:44.148

You know, college is gonna be
so great. We don't need any friends.

01:06:18.391 --> 01:06:21.286
Yeah. We can totally reinvent ourselves
as sloppy skanks who don't need anyone

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:23.020
and gain 15 pounds.

01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:27.942
God, shit buckets.

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:31.696
Fuck.

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:43.043
- Hello.
- What's going on back there?

01:06:43.624 --> 01:06:45.626
- I'm sorry, I, I was...
- Texting?

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:48.004
- Thinking?
- Well...

01:06:48.087 --> 01:06:50.065
you can't just stay still,
you have to keep moving.

01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:51.841
- I know.
- And other people have places

01:06:51.924 --> 01:06:54.427
- to go, too, so you can't stop them.
- No, I, I know that.

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:58.264
There is a whole life happening
all around you and you can't control it

01:06:58.389 --> 01:07:00.224
just by stopping whenever you please

01:07:00.307 --> 01:07:02.285
and decide everybody else
just have to fall into place.

01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:03.644
I get it, fuck!

01:07:07.231 --> 01:07:08.274
Have you been smoking?

01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:10.442
No.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.486
Then what's that bong in the backseat?

01:07:12.945 --> 01:07:17.945
Oh, that donk... That's funny. That's a, a sculpture that I, I
made in school. It is. I, we're, I, I'm Student Body President.

01:07:22.288 --> 01:07:24.874
I'm a good kid. I am. I just,
I have a lot on my plate right now.

01:07:24.957 --> 01:07:27.334
I'm so stressed out.
I, I, I'm graduating.

01:07:27.418 --> 01:07:29.058
- Right now...
- Are you going to college?

01:07:29.253 --> 01:07:30.546
Yeah, Columbia.

01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:34.925
- It's a university.
- Oh, it is? It's not just a country?

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.320
Now, I wonder if the people at Columbia

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.556
would be excited to find out
that one of their future students

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:43.184
- was arrested for possession.
- What?

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:45.811
I don't know
what the fuck you're thinking

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:48.689
driving around with a bong
in the backseat of your car.

01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:50.399
Who do you think you are, Willie Nelson?

01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:53.027
Now, even he got arrested.

01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:54.570
You're arresting me?

01:07:57.406 --> 01:08:00.743
All right. Look, I'm not,
I'm not gonna ruin your life forever.

01:08:01.702 --> 01:08:03.287
Oh, thank God. Thank you.

01:08:05.122 --> 01:08:07.291
But I am gonna fuck it up
for about a week.

01:08:08.375 --> 01:08:11.212
God,
you could be in jail right now.

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:15.633
I can't believe
you would do something so stupid!

01:08:15.716 --> 01:08:18.051
Mom, I'm a really safe driver.
I was just distracted.

01:08:18.219 --> 01:08:19.219
Yeah, but...

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:21.763
Lil...

01:08:24.058 --> 01:08:25.059
- Smash it.
- No.

01:08:25.142 --> 01:08:26.477
- Yes.
- Mom.

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:27.895
This is Donkey Bong.

01:08:28.312 --> 01:08:30.207
All right? He has been with us
through all of high school.

01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:31.273
Thomas smoked out of this.

01:08:31.689 --> 01:08:33.442
Smash it.

01:08:33.692 --> 01:08:36.569
I wasn't even smoking. I was sad driving!

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.197
What's sad driving?

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:40.950
Rebecca was,
she was sitting with her new roommate.

01:08:41.033 --> 01:08:43.743
Chloe's not going to NYU.
She fucking hates me

01:08:43.828 --> 01:08:46.468
and she's, she's ditching prom
for the orientation of her new life.

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:51.210
Okay. So, be happy for her,
you should be supportive of her choices.

01:08:51.292 --> 01:08:53.563
But her choices, they're wrong.
She’s making a huge mistake.

01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:55.464
She is ruining our lives.

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.716
Lily, she wants a change.

01:08:57.966 --> 01:09:00.719
It's not some affront
to what you guys share together.

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:02.531
- Yes, it is. That's exactly what it is.
- No...

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:04.390
No wonder she wants to get away from you.

01:09:04.932 --> 01:09:06.850
- Mom, why are you yelling at me
- Because

01:09:06.934 --> 01:09:09.310
- about this?
- You're being a monster.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:13.023
You think you know everything?
You don't know shit.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:16.569
Now learn your lesson
and smash your bong!

01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:21.027
Really good parenting, mom.

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:26.745
Well, fuck.

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:28.956
Fuck.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.332
Fuck. Fuck.

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:34.586
Fuck.

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:44.430
<i>Hey, this is Chloe.
Leave a message.</i>

01:09:55.316 --> 01:10:00.613
<i>Hey, guys, it's Meils.
Uhm, I don't check my messages. So...</i>

01:10:01.488 --> 01:10:03.240
<i>see you when I see you, motherfucker.</i>

01:10:06.368 --> 01:10:10.915
<i>Hi, it's Rebecca. I'm not here
right now, so leave a message. Bye.</i>

01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:19.381
<i>Bergbaum-Goldwyn Residence One.</i>

01:10:19.757 --> 01:10:22.343
Hi Rosa, uhm, is Chloe over there?

01:10:23.093 --> 01:10:26.555
<i>Chloe, Beck, Melia. Where are you?</i>

01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:44.178
You need any help, Madame President?

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:46.074
Stop.

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:50.222
I, uh, I couldn't find you
at the party the other night.

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:52.726
- I wanted to congratulate you...
- It's a little vicious, huh?

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:54.917
- What?
- You and Jessica are still involved.

01:10:55.334 --> 01:10:57.229
- Don't you think that's a little hurtful?
- Jessica and I have a bond,

01:10:57.253 --> 01:11:00.213
but her being completely insane keeps us
from ever being in a relationship.

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:02.590
We're not together.

01:11:04.009 --> 01:11:06.679
I like spending time with you.
I care about you.

01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:08.322
Yeah, well, I don't wanna be that girl.

01:11:09.306 --> 01:11:12.118
Yeah, you made that pretty clear
when you blew-and-dashed the other day.

01:11:12.142 --> 01:11:14.037
- You couldn't turn me down fast enough.
- Yeah, clearly,

01:11:14.061 --> 01:11:17.101
because you were shoving your tongue
down your ex's throat a few hours later.

01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:20.067
Wait, I wanted to be with you
and now you're jealous?

01:11:20.567 --> 01:11:22.444
Oh God. Don't flatter yourself.

01:11:23.737 --> 01:11:26.457
You know, for someone who's so nice,
you're actually kind of a bitch.

01:11:28.492 --> 01:11:30.828
- Wow.
- Wow what?

01:11:32.538 --> 01:11:33.747
Are you gonna talk to me?

01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:37.668
No? Okay, awesome. Fuck you.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:42.880
Whatever.

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:06.113
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:12:08.699 --> 01:12:10.868
- What's wrong?
- Everything.

01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:16.832
No, it's just prom shit. What's up?

01:12:18.208 --> 01:12:19.209
Uhm...

01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:22.755
It's stupid but, uhm...

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:24.673
What's Chloe's favorite color?

01:12:25.632 --> 01:12:27.843
- It's for her corsage.
- She's not going.

01:12:28.969 --> 01:12:34.141
Oh. And so she's, uh,
going to the pre-frosh orientation thing.

01:12:34.224 --> 01:12:35.768
Yeah, right, of course you knew.

01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:39.271
Oh, uh, well, she had mentioned
something about it.

01:12:39.772 --> 01:12:41.482
Okay. I got to go get streamers.

01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:52.534
It's green, for what it's worth.

01:12:53.577 --> 01:12:54.577
Thanks.

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:56.413
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:02.123
What are you doing?

01:13:03.337 --> 01:13:04.797
Figuring out what to wear to prom.

01:13:05.964 --> 01:13:07.049
Paper bag should do.

01:13:07.925 --> 01:13:09.134
Oh, you mean on your body.

01:13:15.474 --> 01:13:16.474
Stop.

01:13:16.767 --> 01:13:18.769
- Are you on your period?
- Yes.

01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:22.601
I think that actual steam
just came out of your ears.

01:13:26.527 --> 01:13:27.528
This is pretty.

01:13:27.778 --> 01:13:30.322
Dude, no, do not.
You're gonna stretch it.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:33.158
My slender boyish figure
is the stuff that trannies dream of.

01:13:34.201 --> 01:13:35.201
Talk.

01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:37.704
Mom's pissed at me.

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:41.083
Yeah, but you know she'll deal.
What's really going on?

01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:45.170
All the girls hate me.

01:13:46.046 --> 01:13:49.883
Which kind of makes sense,
I've pretty much sucked lately.

01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:53.846
I mean, you are a freak. But,
uh, I mean, you've always been like that.

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:58.298
You know, I mean,
maybe you've been a bit, uh...

01:13:59.143 --> 01:14:01.812
you know, like BFFAEAE this year

01:14:01.895 --> 01:14:03.397
with your power pussy posse.

01:14:03.981 --> 01:14:07.359
But, uh, you know,
I mean, your expiration dating.

01:14:07.734 --> 01:14:10.296
You know, I mean, you taught me that.
It's like, uh, you know, like camp dude,

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.197
summer was over and he was like, uh,

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:14.926
he was like, "Oh, you're so hot,"
you know, "you give the best handys,

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:17.035
we're gonna AIM all the time
and all that shit."

01:14:18.537 --> 01:14:21.266
It's like when you know things are ending,
you freak out, and you try to hold on

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:23.709
and then it gets weird waiting it out.

01:14:27.087 --> 01:14:28.672
When did you get so wise?

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:31.467
I'm surrounded by brilliant women.

01:14:34.553 --> 01:14:37.389
- You got to get a new mindset.
- What? Like an emotional pre-game?

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:39.183
It's like feel shitty or be alone.

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:44.330
You know, I mean, dad left
the night before our Disneyland trip.

01:14:45.063 --> 01:14:47.083
You know, we didn't go. I mean,
that shit's gonna fuck me up

01:14:47.107 --> 01:14:48.901
for the rest of my life, but it's chill.

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:52.779
C.A.R.L. 4ever

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:54.030
C.A.R.L. forever?

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:56.340
- Shut up.
- What are you, a gay trucker?

01:15:02.414 --> 01:15:03.707
I'll leave you to wallow now.

01:15:06.585 --> 01:15:07.669
- Take it off.
- Nope.

01:15:16.803 --> 01:15:18.180
Hi, Robert, it's Jill.

01:15:20.307 --> 01:15:24.561
Just calling, 'cause our daughter's
high school graduation is coming up...

01:15:27.481 --> 01:15:28.649
Valedictorian.

01:15:30.108 --> 01:15:31.151
Speech.

01:15:32.402 --> 01:15:34.404
Gonna be a, a big one.

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:38.492
Yeah, could make up
for all the others that you missed,

01:15:39.159 --> 01:15:42.704
maybe. Olivia and James are, are well.
They're becoming really...

01:15:44.331 --> 01:15:47.793
just wonderful, smart people.

01:15:47.918 --> 01:15:50.212
I think you'd really like them.

01:15:52.631 --> 01:15:54.508
I do. I think you'd really like them.

01:15:55.926 --> 01:16:00.764
Anyway, I'd say talk soon, but I think
we both know that's not gonna happen.

01:16:00.847 --> 01:16:06.520
Okay? All right. Graduation, Tuesday.
If you give a shit, go fuck yourself.

01:16:06.603 --> 01:16:09.982
Okay. Okay, goodbye.
Go fuck... Yeah. Go fuck yourself.

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:12.693

It was so funny, and then
I don't even know what's going on.

01:19:00.277 --> 01:19:01.838
I can't believe
we're at prom though.

01:19:01.862 --> 01:19:03.196
Thank God we got invited.

01:19:03.363 --> 01:19:05.466
- But I need to be way more drunk.
- Me, too.

01:19:05.490 --> 01:19:09.536
Oh. Slow your roll, girls,
the night is long.

01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:12.079
Whiskey?

01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:14.749
Why not?

01:19:27.053 --> 01:19:27.971
- Hi.
- What's up?

01:19:28.054 --> 01:19:30.015
You, uh, you look beautiful.

01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:33.602
- You look beautiful.
- All right, thank you.

01:19:33.685 --> 01:19:36.485
Uhm, look, I just really wanted
to apologize for, for getting all weird

01:19:36.521 --> 01:19:38.681
and walking away from you
the other day in the library.

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:42.360
Loans categorically suck
and I'm still paying mine off.

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:46.448
So, you know, If you ever wanna talk,
I can imagine it's not the kind of thing

01:19:46.531 --> 01:19:48.867
that gets,
gets a lot of attention around here.

01:19:49.034 --> 01:19:52.913
Yeah, it's not really a big topic of
conversation amongst my friends. You know.

01:19:53.163 --> 01:19:57.209
But, uhm, it's very cool
that you are dealing with it now.

01:19:58.251 --> 01:19:59.753
- Got to do it, so...
- Yeah.

01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:01.755
How's, uh, how's your date?

01:20:02.923 --> 01:20:06.468
Uhm, it was just supposed
to be us girls, but things are changing.

01:20:06.551 --> 01:20:09.054
Everyone's leaving, it's weird, you know.

01:20:09.262 --> 01:20:12.516
Well, what endures
when all else has changed?

01:20:12.724 --> 01:20:14.518
- It is love.
- It is love. Kierkegaard.

01:20:14.601 --> 01:20:16.269
- Hm-mmm.
- I love that guy.

01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:17.770
- Yeah.
- You know, poet.

01:20:18.021 --> 01:20:20.649
Well, look, just tell them
your love hasn't changed.

01:20:21.191 --> 01:20:22.692
You'll only get so many chances.

01:20:29.741 --> 01:20:32.744
- You sad about leaving?
- Not really.

01:20:33.912 --> 01:20:35.539
I'm just glad I have another year here.

01:20:36.373 --> 01:20:38.124
I can't imagine leaving this place.

01:20:56.893 --> 01:20:58.019
<i>What are we doing?</i>

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:04.150
You're leaving in a couple of months.
I, I don't know what Chloe's gonna do.

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:07.195
Hey, Lil, this isn't some fling.

01:21:11.408 --> 01:21:12.408
I love you.

01:21:14.744 --> 01:21:15.744
Hey.

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:19.583
Hey.

01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:24.796
You came back.

01:21:27.048 --> 01:21:31.219
Mr. Bemis: What's a fart that sounds
and smells like nothing? A Sartre

01:21:33.638 --> 01:21:34.681
I hate boys.

01:21:35.056 --> 01:21:37.559
I know. We're ready for men.

01:21:37.976 --> 01:21:41.563
No. You know what I need right now?
I need my dudes, where the fuck is Lily?

01:21:41.646 --> 01:21:43.940
I don't know. I wish Clo was here, too.

01:21:44.691 --> 01:21:46.276
I miss our token white friends.

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:48.194
I know, it's ironic.

01:21:56.661 --> 01:21:57.829
This just...

01:21:59.706 --> 01:22:02.250
- Wasn't we had planned?
- Wasn't us.

01:22:04.794 --> 01:22:07.088
God, that fuckhead Mike's in there.

01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:13.261
They have fucked me up, just fucked up.

01:22:14.846 --> 01:22:18.016
Lil, whatever happened
with that guy, I just...

01:22:21.311 --> 01:22:22.437
I'm really sorry.

01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:26.191
I'm sorry.

01:22:30.236 --> 01:22:32.072
I think I'm so fucking well-adjusted.

01:22:32.155 --> 01:22:35.200
I'm not, I'm just this,
like, Stepford wife control freak.

01:22:36.117 --> 01:22:37.160
I'm crazy.

01:22:41.206 --> 01:22:43.875
And I'm so sorry
for being so intense about Thomas.

01:22:47.170 --> 01:22:48.630
I just wanted to be sad together.

01:22:50.674 --> 01:22:53.426
I get it, sometimes you don't wanna talk,
and he's not my brother,

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:55.830
and just because I was in love with him,
it doesn't mean...

01:22:56.596 --> 01:22:58.515
He was in love with you, too, Lil.

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:00.183
I know.

01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:02.602
He wrote me a letter about it.

01:23:05.105 --> 01:23:06.356
Look, Lil...

01:23:09.442 --> 01:23:10.986
It's gonna hurt forever.

01:23:13.863 --> 01:23:15.365
It's part of who we are now.

01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:20.370
Mourning what was

01:23:21.538 --> 01:23:22.706
and what is,

01:23:23.915 --> 01:23:25.458
is sad enough, Lil.

01:23:27.335 --> 01:23:30.380
I just, I can't take on mourning
something that could have been.

01:23:32.799 --> 01:23:36.594
And, you know, whatever it is,
whatever is gonna happen,

01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:39.097
we're still gonna be us.

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:45.645
You're my life partner.

01:23:56.614 --> 01:23:58.324
I'm sorry about your prom.

01:23:59.284 --> 01:24:01.327
No, you are my prom.

01:24:08.251 --> 01:24:09.461
Ready?

01:24:18.762 --> 01:24:21.306
Oh! Look who decided to show.

01:24:22.599 --> 01:24:24.239
- Come on, I couldn't miss prom.
- Hm-mmm.

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:27.312
Guys, I'm really sorry
for being such a psycho.

01:24:27.479 --> 01:24:28.772
- It's okay.
- Yeah, it's okay.

01:24:28.855 --> 01:24:30.735
You're like
the obsessive boyfriend I never had.

01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:34.194
What is never changed
when everything's changed?

01:24:34.861 --> 01:24:35.904
It is love.

01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:38.531
Oh. I love you.

01:24:38.656 --> 01:24:41.868
Now, I don't know what's gonna happen,
but I've got you guys,

01:24:41.951 --> 01:24:45.038
- and that is pretty fucking good.
- Yeah, girl.

01:24:45.371 --> 01:24:46.611
- Let's blow this joint.
- Yeah.

01:24:46.664 --> 01:24:48.416
- Yes.
- Prom sucks.

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:49.500
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

01:24:49.542 --> 01:24:50.543
Yes.

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:01.030
Have you seen the video
that she's talking about?

01:25:01.054 --> 01:25:03.056
- No.
- It, it's the best.

01:25:03.139 --> 01:25:06.518
- ...your fucking phone. Asshole.
- Why were you looking at my phone?

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:07.961
You can't look in my phone.

01:25:11.689 --> 01:25:12.816
Hey, remember me?

01:25:14.442 --> 01:25:16.277
Hey, how's it go...

01:25:17.278 --> 01:25:20.115
- Oh!
- Shit!

01:25:20.198 --> 01:25:22.033
- Go fuck yourself.
- Fuck, yeah!

01:25:22.117 --> 01:25:23.785
That was awesome.

01:25:23.868 --> 01:25:25.787
- Yeah. You can't fucking look...
- Fuck you.

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:34.087
- Hey.
- Shit, sorry you had to see that.

01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:36.506
Everything okay?

01:25:38.091 --> 01:25:42.637
Uhm, she's mad that I have a phone...

01:25:43.555 --> 01:25:44.597
I guess.

01:25:46.766 --> 01:25:49.966
I don't know. She's fucking crazy, man.
I shouldn't have brought her, that was...

01:25:50.478 --> 01:25:51.521
a bad idea.

01:25:53.398 --> 01:25:56.609
I have been such a dick to you
and I, I'm really sorry.

01:25:56.693 --> 01:25:58.987
I didn't mean to be. And I'm really sorry.

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:02.740
Noah, I've been kind of dick-like, too.

01:26:05.201 --> 01:26:07.745
- Dickishness forgiven?
- Yeah.

01:26:08.872 --> 01:26:11.624
Great. Come on. Let's go.

01:26:14.878 --> 01:26:17.213
- Yay!
- Yo, now the party's here.

01:26:40.653 --> 01:26:41.988
Last ones to leave,

01:26:42.488 --> 01:26:43.531
classy girls.

01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:45.658
Savoring every moment.

01:26:47.076 --> 01:26:48.804
All right, ladies.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:26:48.828 --> 01:26:51.988
Oh, wait, wait, let me get a picture of you. - Oh, seriously?
- Yes.

01:26:52.415 --> 01:26:53.684
- Yeah.
- So let's take pictures,

01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:54.768
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, okay.

01:26:54.792 --> 01:26:57.128
Oh, that's good. All right.
Freeze it, hold it.

01:26:58.838 --> 01:27:00.381
She smashed brother's Donkey Bong?

01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:02.425
Donkey Bong,

01:27:03.009 --> 01:27:08.640
there with us through high school,
life, death, SATs, prom,

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:12.810
we only had a little bit of weed, but we
wanted to get, like, really, really high.

01:27:13.353 --> 01:27:18.608
We bury you next to your brethren,
Jon Bong Jovi, Sean Bongery,

01:27:19.359 --> 01:27:22.946
Bong Connery, "Ceci n'est pas une pipe."

01:27:26.366 --> 01:27:27.492
You will be missed.

01:27:32.288 --> 01:27:33.331
Oh.

01:27:40.672 --> 01:27:41.756
Now, what do we do?

01:27:42.423 --> 01:27:47.929
Hmm, I have to finish my grad speech,
but I almost don't give a fuck.

01:27:48.263 --> 01:27:49.347
What do you have so far?

01:27:50.431 --> 01:27:52.433
Mmm, I'm writing that on my phone.

01:27:54.686 --> 01:27:57.105
- Well, stand up. Do it for us.
- Yeah.

01:27:57.563 --> 01:28:00.525
- Hmm?
- Lily, Lily.

01:28:00.692 --> 01:28:04.862
Okay. I've tried to put a name
on what I'm feeling.

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:08.908
It has to do with fear,
of the unknown, of change.

01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:11.327
It's wrapped up in memory,

01:28:11.411 --> 01:28:14.330
being in the places
that have contained your life.

01:28:14.706 --> 01:28:16.541
It has the sense of too-soon nostalgia,

01:28:16.624 --> 01:28:19.294
as if I deeply long
for what's right in front of me.

01:28:19.419 --> 01:28:21.504
Then a friend said it, loss.

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:25.925
Is that what I'm feeling,
what it means to grow up?

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:28.303
Your growing familiarity

01:28:28.386 --> 01:28:31.556
with an acceptance
of the pain of life's losses?

01:28:32.265 --> 01:28:36.352
<i>Growing up is understanding
what eases that pain, friendship.</i>

01:28:37.103 --> 01:28:39.981
<i>A bond fused by tears, traumas,</i>

01:28:40.106 --> 01:28:43.609
<i>hours logged in the same cars,
in front of the same TVs.</i>

01:28:44.652 --> 01:28:46.852
<i>All of our memories
are wrapped up in each other.</i>

01:28:47.655 --> 01:28:49.949
<i>It's the greatest gift
this place has given us,</i>

01:28:50.033 --> 01:28:51.784
<i>and it's part of our loss today.</i>

01:28:52.702 --> 01:28:55.997
<i>But the poet, Robert Penn Warren
gave a better definition of loss,</i>

01:28:56.414 --> 01:28:58.541
<i>what loss can be if we approach it right.</i>

01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:02.587
<i>"The process whereby
the pain of the past in its pastness</i>

01:29:02.712 --> 01:29:05.548
<i>may be converted
into the future tense of joy."</i>

01:29:13.556 --> 01:29:14.766
Mr. Bemis.

01:29:15.892 --> 01:29:17.435
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:29:19.562 --> 01:29:23.983
- Okay, uh, call me Immanuel.
- Immanuel? Really?

01:29:24.150 --> 01:29:26.527
- Hm-mmm.
- Uhm, thank you for the flowers.

01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:27.779
I'm glad you came.

01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:31.949
God, what am I gonna do without you?

01:29:32.867 --> 01:29:36.579
- You're the reason I come to school.
- Me, too. For you.

01:29:39.457 --> 01:29:40.792
Look, I know it's wrong.

01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:45.129
I'm 18, though.
Look, I just graduated, so...

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:50.760
I'm, I'm 24, but I have
the emotional maturity of like a 20 or...

01:29:50.843 --> 01:29:51.904
- Right. Right. Right.
- maximum.

01:29:51.928 --> 01:29:53.721
- Come, come meet my mom.
- Wow, uh...

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:58.976
I'm nervous. All right.
In the middle? Immanuel Bemis.

01:30:03.981 --> 01:30:06.317
- Wait, wait, wait.
- I'm gonna get all of us.

01:30:06.651 --> 01:30:09.570
- Amelia.
- Rosa.

01:30:09.862 --> 01:30:13.366
Your brownies are so delicious,
everybody loves them.

01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:16.244
Where did you, where did you get this?

01:30:17.161 --> 01:30:19.163
Damn, I love to chill, dude.

01:30:19.789 --> 01:30:21.541
- Hi.
- Congratulations.

01:30:21.624 --> 01:30:24.127
You killed your speech.
I was crying the whole time.

01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:25.813
- Thank you.
- Thanks. Yeah. It was great.

01:30:25.837 --> 01:30:28.023
- Are we still on for dinner tomorrow?
- Yeah, motherfucker.

01:30:28.047 --> 01:30:31.092
My mom is currently basting
the brisket as we speak, so, yeah.

01:30:31.175 --> 01:30:32.260
- Amazing.
- Great.

01:30:32.385 --> 01:30:34.220
Lily, I wanna get a family photo.

01:30:34.637 --> 01:30:37.098
Okay. Go photo. I'm gonna stay here
and to really eat

01:30:37.181 --> 01:30:41.101
- every single one of these brownies. - Okay. - Hey, guys.
- Go. Okay, wait, here she comes.

01:30:50.486 --> 01:30:52.422
- All right. Go. Go. Go. Get in there.
- You just literally ruin it.

01:30:52.446 --> 01:30:53.656
- Do something.
- Whoa.

01:30:53.906 --> 01:30:56.367
- I'm sorry.
- Do something, uhm, adorable.

01:30:56.450 --> 01:30:58.119
The monkeys. The monkeys.

01:30:58.703 --> 01:31:00.288
- Aw. Do it.
- The monkeys.

01:31:00.746 --> 01:31:02.915
Oh, there it is. There it is.

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:06.252
Good one. And we'll do that thing
where you guys hit a hundred times.

01:31:06.335 --> 01:31:08.004
- And enough now. Come with me.
- Perfect.

01:31:09.172 --> 01:31:10.482
- How are you doing?
- Little bro.

01:31:10.506 --> 01:31:12.925
- How do you feel about everything?
- Free. I made it.

01:31:13.426 --> 01:31:15.696
- And you're gonna miss the shit out of me.
- Do you feel all right about it?

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:17.805
- Yeah.
- I'll be right back.

01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:25.313
What?

01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:32.361
Rosa may have served the brownies
that I made for our private after party.

01:31:32.445 --> 01:31:33.446
- What?
- What?

01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:35.323
Just look.

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:38.784
- But how much weed's in them?
- Like an ounce.

01:31:38.868 --> 01:31:39.702
- An ounce?
- Fuck.

01:31:39.785 --> 01:31:41.412
- Maybe like four ounces.
- Four ounces?

01:31:41.495 --> 01:31:43.748
- I thought we deserve to get high.
- Oh my God.

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:49.503
Your heads are so huge
in a good way.

01:31:50.671 --> 01:31:52.632
