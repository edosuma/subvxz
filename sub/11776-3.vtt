Ten of the best tattoo artists

00:03.633 --> 00:04.867
on the planet

00:04.933 --> 00:07.000
are competing to determine
who's number one.

00:07.667 --> 00:08.833
[screaming]

00:08.900 --> 00:10.667
On the last episode
of Ink Master ,

00:10.733 --> 00:12.467
nine artists were left--

00:12.533 --> 00:13.967
[Dave] Each week,
we've been testing you

00:14.033 --> 00:16.667
on the essential skills
needed to become an Ink Master .

00:16.733 --> 00:18.600
Today,
these are your canvases.

00:20.067 --> 00:21.733
[narrator]
The artists' line skills

00:21.800 --> 00:23.867
were put to the test
in the Flash Challenge.

00:23.933 --> 00:26.333
This [bleep]
is hard to do.

00:26.400 --> 00:27.433
You want me
to [bleep] judge

00:27.500 --> 00:28.400
from this little
[bleep] you did?

00:28.467 --> 00:29.933
Holy [bleep].

00:30.000 --> 00:32.867
It seems like every time,
those guys just rip me up.

00:32.933 --> 00:36.367
Seriously, Heather, it's not
going to be easy, period.

00:36.433 --> 00:38.333
[narrator]
In the elimination tattoo,

00:38.400 --> 00:39.867
Bili's canvas blacked out--

00:39.933 --> 00:41.633
[bleep].

00:41.700 --> 00:43.867
Leaving him
with an unfinished tattoo.

00:43.933 --> 00:46.667
Bili got a guy walking outside
with half his head done.

00:46.733 --> 00:47.700
Everybody here,

00:47.767 --> 00:49.767
they send you home,
and they keep Bili,

00:49.833 --> 00:51.167
you're gonna feel
[bleep] up.

00:51.233 --> 00:54.367
[narrator] At the elimination,
Jeremy, Lea, and Al

00:54.433 --> 00:55.600
were the bottom three.

00:55.667 --> 00:57.800
You guys came to compete.
You're not hitting it.

00:57.867 --> 01:00.400
Lea, these lines
are incredibly shaky.

01:00.467 --> 01:02.400
It's not clean work.

01:02.467 --> 01:05.433
Jeremy, the quality that
you showed in this competition

01:05.500 --> 01:08.967
proves to me that you can't
do a one-pass clean outline.

01:09.033 --> 01:10.933
Al,
that's tattoo 101, man.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.367
You do faces facing inward.

01:14.433 --> 01:17.800
Jeremy, you don't have
what it takes to be Ink Master .

01:19.167 --> 01:21.167
[narrator] Eight artists remain,

01:21.233 --> 01:24.567
but only one
will earn a $100 thousand prize

01:24.633 --> 01:27.300
and the title of Ink Master.

01:27.367 --> 01:30.333
[rock music]

01:30.400 --> 01:36.300
â™ª â™ª

02:05.800 --> 02:06.833
[upbeat music]

02:14.967 --> 02:16.500
We need to stop
being [bleep] friends

02:16.567 --> 02:18.200
and start acting
like competitors.

02:18.267 --> 02:19.600
Bili didn't
finish his tattoo.

02:19.667 --> 02:21.833
He should be going home,
point-blank.

02:21.900 --> 02:24.067
I don't want nobody
seeing my art no more.

02:24.133 --> 02:25.900
Bili got a guy
with half his head done.

02:25.967 --> 02:27.867
He jumped out the window
without a parachute,

02:27.933 --> 02:29.500
and he's still here.

02:29.567 --> 02:31.467
I'm gonna send him
home next round.

02:31.533 --> 02:34.033
Don't come in my shop peep--
peeking at my work.

02:34.100 --> 02:35.500
You see the [bleep]
on the screen.

02:35.567 --> 02:37.400
I see that Al likes
to get attention.

02:37.467 --> 02:38.733
I don't know
if he's here to tattoo

02:38.800 --> 02:39.667
or to be entertainment.

02:39.733 --> 02:42.167
[bleep] Al,
you're crazy, bro.

02:42.233 --> 02:44.867
All artists are crazy.
It ain't me.

02:48.600 --> 02:49.833
[machine whirring

02:53.367 --> 02:55.733
You're all one step
closer to that 100 grand,

02:55.800 --> 02:57.300
the write-up
in Inked Magazine,

02:57.367 --> 03:00.567
and most importantly,
the title of Ink Master.

03:00.633 --> 03:02.767
As always, we begin
with a Flash Challenge.

03:02.833 --> 03:05.300
Each week, we've been testing
you on the essential skills

03:05.367 --> 03:07.333
needed to become
an Ink Master .

03:07.400 --> 03:09.400
This week,
we're testing you on shading.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.900
Without shading,
tattoos are flat and lifeless.

03:13.967 --> 03:16.033
[Heather] The importance
of shading in tattooing

03:16.100 --> 03:19.333
is that you're trying to make
something have a dimension

03:19.400 --> 03:20.933
you might use
the shadow underneath it,

03:21.033 --> 03:23.233
whatever it takes
to create depth in a tattoo.

03:23.300 --> 03:24.933
The winner will get
the first pick

03:25.000 --> 03:25.900
of the human canvas

03:25.967 --> 03:27.400
for the elimination tattoo.

03:27.467 --> 03:29.600
Before we get into too much
detail about your task,

03:29.667 --> 03:31.033
let's meet your canvases.

03:31.100 --> 03:32.467
[upbeat music]

03:35.533 --> 03:37.133
Wow.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.300
[rock music playing]

03:43.867 --> 03:45.667
Lord have mercy,
they done brought

03:45.733 --> 03:47.467
some half-naked ladies out here

03:47.533 --> 03:49.733
with pasties on
and a camel toe.

03:49.800 --> 03:53.800
This is the most amazing thing
I've seen all week Long.

03:53.867 --> 03:56.367
Things just got a little bit
hotter up in here.

03:56.433 --> 03:57.433
In this challenge,

03:57.500 --> 03:59.300
you'll be working
in a different art form.

03:59.367 --> 04:01.267
Your canvas is still
human skin,

04:01.333 --> 04:03.800
but instead of a machine,
you'll be using a paintbrush.

04:03.867 --> 04:05.500
You've been assigned
a random model.

04:05.567 --> 04:06.933
Right now, she's flat.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.467
And when I say, "Flat,"
I mean she's painted white.

04:09.533 --> 04:10.700
Obviously.

04:10.767 --> 04:13.300
Your job is to use shading
to transform her

04:13.367 --> 04:15.367
into a unique,
three-dimensional design.

04:15.433 --> 04:17.200
And what that is
is up to you.

04:17.267 --> 04:20.233
As always, you'll be judged
by Oliver Peck, Chris Nunez,

04:20.300 --> 04:22.600
and I'll be taking
a very special interest

04:22.667 --> 04:23.833
in this one myself.

04:23.900 --> 04:25.800
We'll be looking at how well
you use your shading

04:25.867 --> 04:27.067
to transform your model.

04:27.133 --> 04:29.200
You've got 90 minutes
to complete this challenge.

04:29.267 --> 04:31.233
And your time starts now.

04:31.300 --> 04:33.700
[cheerful music]

04:33.767 --> 04:35.567
Here, can you stand just
sideways, like facing that way--

04:35.633 --> 04:36.467
Yeah, that's good.

04:36.533 --> 04:38.233
What're we gonna do here?

04:38.300 --> 04:39.700
[Chris] Shading is everything.

04:39.767 --> 04:41.967
It's the way you give
dimension to a tattoo,

04:42.033 --> 04:44.767
it's the way you cast
light and shadows

04:44.833 --> 04:46.767
to make things
more intense or more dramatic.

04:46.833 --> 04:49.500
I love being on my knees
in front of a beautiful lady.

04:49.567 --> 04:51.233
I'm gonna do some flowers,

04:51.300 --> 04:52.700
so I'm gonna draw it
like I'm actually gonna

04:52.767 --> 04:53.767
get ready
to tattoo it on her.

04:55.933 --> 04:57.333
I got some ideas, here.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.133
Let's get out the tattoo world
for a minute.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.167
Let's make this
all-white person--

05:01.233 --> 05:02.333
Let's make her look real.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.700
Let's go with three-quarter
lighting.

05:03.767 --> 05:05.600
So this side of your face
will be lit up.

05:05.667 --> 05:08.333
The top lip is always darker
than the bottom

05:08.400 --> 05:10.200
because it gets no light.

05:10.267 --> 05:12.233
I'm gonna take these boys
to an art class.

05:12.300 --> 05:13.567
Al Fliction's art class.

05:16.033 --> 05:17.967
Just stay just like that.

05:18.033 --> 05:19.800
I was glad to see
it's just black and white.

05:19.867 --> 05:21.500
I mean, I do black and gray,
I do it well.

05:21.567 --> 05:24.067
To be able to do smooth shading
in black and gray

05:24.133 --> 05:25.467
is even harder than color,

05:25.533 --> 05:26.633
because you can see

05:26.700 --> 05:28.333
any little glitch
in the shading.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.200
I feel like I have an advantage
because this is what I do.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.000
I have an idea.

05:35.067 --> 05:36.233
Some of us are worrying
a little bit.

05:36.300 --> 05:37.833
More and more people
are gonna start going home,

05:37.900 --> 05:39.533
but I think we still feel

05:39.600 --> 05:41.733
that there's some people
that are gonna go first.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.700
The weakest artists
are apparent.

05:43.767 --> 05:47.167
Careful around them nipples
with them brushes.

05:47.233 --> 05:49.000
I've seen what Al's
doing over there,

05:49.067 --> 05:51.033
and I don't know
what the hell that is.

05:52.100 --> 05:53.667
That tickle?
My bad.

05:53.733 --> 05:54.733
[giggling]

05:54.800 --> 05:56.067
The judges are not
gonna like the fact

05:56.133 --> 05:58.233
that he just
painted her half black.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.000
[Al] Okay, girl.
That looking good.

06:00.067 --> 06:02.900
This ain't summer camp,
this is a competition.

06:02.967 --> 06:04.900
You do you,
I'm gonna do me.

06:04.967 --> 06:06.667
I'm knee-deep
in a naked woman.

06:06.733 --> 06:08.967
I've never painted a person,
so let's go for it.

06:09.033 --> 06:11.833
You're all good, girl,
don't you worry.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.133
I'm gonna do a skull,

06:13.200 --> 06:14.700
and I'm gonna figure out
how to morph her body

06:14.767 --> 06:16.200
so it really
looks like a skull,

06:16.267 --> 06:17.867
and that you can reach
into the eye sockets,

06:17.933 --> 06:18.833
and reach into the nose.

06:21.333 --> 06:22.800
[energetic music]

06:22.867 --> 06:24.600
Thirty minutes
left to go, guys.

06:24.667 --> 06:26.167
[upbeat music]

06:30.700 --> 06:32.367
Good thing you're not
very ticklish, huh?

06:32.433 --> 06:33.467
No.

06:33.533 --> 06:36.100
I see myself still
as at least a top-four.

06:36.167 --> 06:38.067
I feel like I should
be here till the end.

06:38.133 --> 06:39.733
I'm just gonna
keep pushing forward,

06:39.800 --> 06:41.000
and see
who gets to go home.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.667
We all want to stay,

06:43.733 --> 06:45.267
and we know that
somebody is going out.

06:45.333 --> 06:47.567
This is survival.
I want to win this.

06:50.967 --> 06:54.767
I gotta get some more
gradation in here.

06:54.833 --> 06:56.633
These Flash Challenges
are difficult

06:56.700 --> 06:58.933
because it's so on the spot,

06:59.000 --> 07:01.633
and everything that I do
is meticulously planned out.

07:04.233 --> 07:06.733
Heather better get
more than just that face done,

07:06.800 --> 07:07.967
is what I'm worried about.

07:08.033 --> 07:09.300
I know my piece is small,

07:09.367 --> 07:11.500
but I spent an hour on that
back, and I raced to--

07:11.567 --> 07:12.533
You want me
to [bleep] judge

07:12.600 --> 07:13.667
from this little [bleep]
you did?

07:15.567 --> 07:18.800
Don't crack your face, okay?
'Cause then I'll be screwed.

07:18.867 --> 07:20.200
[Dave] Five minutes left to go.

07:20.267 --> 07:21.400
[energetic music playing]

07:23.333 --> 07:25.567
Alright,
we got to hurry.

07:25.633 --> 07:28.767
Let me fix this real quick
before the thing goes off.

07:31.067 --> 07:33.367
I'm actually putting,
like, pulleys all over you.

07:33.433 --> 07:34.800
[Dave] One minute left.

07:38.067 --> 07:39.967
Coming down
to the wire, people.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.100
Five seconds.

07:45.700 --> 07:46.567
And...

07:48.733 --> 07:50.833
Brushes down, time's up.

07:56.700 --> 07:58.100
Alright, Tommy.

07:58.167 --> 07:59.333
I tried to work
with the body,

07:59.400 --> 08:01.667
so I used her breasts
as the cheekbones.

08:02.633 --> 08:04.600
From a distance,

08:04.667 --> 08:07.900
that piece is just
literally three-dimensional,

08:07.967 --> 08:09.733
coming out of the skin.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.833
It was interesting
that you put the cheekbones

08:11.900 --> 08:13.367
on the nipple area,
basically.

08:13.433 --> 08:15.767
You know, most people,
everybody would black this out,

08:15.833 --> 08:17.067
or take a different
stance to it.

08:17.133 --> 08:18.067
Nice job.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.000
Bili.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.667
First thing I did
was I laid out, you know,

08:22.733 --> 08:24.333
some compositional flow
across her body.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.033
Then I went in
and just did some details

08:26.100 --> 08:27.500
to show dimension and depth.

08:27.567 --> 08:28.967
You transformed
the shape of her body

08:29.033 --> 08:30.333
into something
that it wasn't.

08:30.400 --> 08:33.732
Just disguised
what her natural shape is.

08:33.799 --> 08:35.799
You got a lot more going up top
than just hair gel.

08:36.533 --> 08:37.900
Thank you.

08:37.967 --> 08:40.067
I definitely think I have a good
chance of taking this challenge.

08:40.133 --> 08:41.533
The other artists
do a great job.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.067
My piece is definitely
in the top few.

08:44.133 --> 08:45.200
Alright, Shane.

08:45.267 --> 08:46.833
Tell us a little bit
about what you did here.

08:46.900 --> 08:48.900
Uh, I just tried to use
the shape of her body.

08:48.967 --> 08:50.100
It's like
something feminine.

08:50.167 --> 08:51.300
Shading is nice.

08:51.367 --> 08:53.133
You used the natural shape
of her body

08:53.200 --> 08:55.667
and added a little more
highlight and depth to it.

08:55.733 --> 08:57.267
It does
ride the body nicely.

08:57.333 --> 08:59.800
Shane is definitely
going in with an advantage.

08:59.867 --> 09:01.300
Anytime there's
black and gray,

09:01.367 --> 09:03.300
he's gonna pull it off
damn near perfect.

09:03.367 --> 09:04.833
And we're all gonna
be looking at it

09:04.900 --> 09:07.000
as trying to get him
off his game.

09:07.067 --> 09:09.167
Heather,
what's going on here?

09:09.233 --> 09:11.867
I just thought I would
make her into half-zombie,

09:11.933 --> 09:14.000
and I just look around
at everyone else,

09:14.067 --> 09:16.433
I'm like,
"Wow, I'm really slow."

09:16.500 --> 09:17.933
[Oliver] I think
the shading is smooth,

09:18.000 --> 09:19.400
especially in the cheekbones.

09:19.467 --> 09:21.133
I would have liked
to have seen more

09:21.200 --> 09:22.467
other than just the face.

09:23.733 --> 09:24.867
[Dave] James.

09:24.933 --> 09:27.333
I tried to do
what I like to do a lot,

09:27.400 --> 09:30.167
one brushstroke-style
Japanese painting.

09:30.233 --> 09:31.267
[Oliver] In this challenge,

09:31.333 --> 09:33.400
we're looking for
your ability to shade.

09:33.467 --> 09:35.867
A lot of tones here,
and a lot of tones there,

09:35.933 --> 09:38.600
but not a whole lot of blending
between dark to light.

09:38.667 --> 09:40.033
You know,
you say, "Shade."

09:40.100 --> 09:44.333
I'm doing three different shades
in one, in one stroke.

09:44.400 --> 09:47.033
You missed the mark
on the actual challenge.

09:49.233 --> 09:51.100
Josh, tell me a little bit
about what happened here.

09:51.833 --> 09:52.933
I tried to keep

09:53.000 --> 09:55.033
more traditional
imagery of tattooing.

09:55.100 --> 09:57.167
Tried to keep everything
with the flow of the body.

09:57.233 --> 09:58.633
This crown here...

09:58.700 --> 10:01.433
To me, that kind of
took this out of that flow.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.967
I lost it, all of a sudden.

10:05.100 --> 10:06.033
[Dave] Lea.

10:06.100 --> 10:07.900
Tell us a little bit
about this, Lea.

10:07.967 --> 10:10.167
[Lea] I put darker shading

10:10.233 --> 10:14.033
where the parts
that were more shaded were.

10:14.100 --> 10:16.233
From a distance,
it just really stands out.

10:16.300 --> 10:17.300
You see the depth.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.933
I really like the way
that the flower

10:19.000 --> 10:20.633
rides the back
of the shoulder like that.

10:20.700 --> 10:22.133
And it's nice and light
in the middle,

10:22.200 --> 10:23.600
with real dark bottoms.

10:23.667 --> 10:25.833
All the Flash Challenges,
I wanted to win,

10:25.900 --> 10:27.433
but this, hopefully,
I don't know,

10:27.500 --> 10:28.467
I might have a chance.

10:29.500 --> 10:30.300
[Dave] Al.

10:31.967 --> 10:33.933
[Al] I studied a little
lighting techniques

10:34.033 --> 10:35.600
with Rembrandt lighting.

10:35.667 --> 10:37.200
With one light source
in the room,

10:37.267 --> 10:38.967
and it hits the body
from this way,

10:39.033 --> 10:40.067
but it's three-quarter
lighting.

10:44.033 --> 10:46.400
It's a simple idea
that nobody would think of.

10:46.467 --> 10:48.933
You came at it
from an artist's perspective.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.300
Basically gave us the exact
definition of this challenge.

10:52.367 --> 10:53.633
It's just shading.

10:53.700 --> 10:55.967
There's nothing,
it's not even an image, so...

10:56.033 --> 10:59.167
I mean, I know at least mine is
gonna stand out more than that.

11:00.633 --> 11:03.300
Okay, I think that
a lot of people excelled here.

11:03.367 --> 11:05.300
I was really
impressed with Tommy.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.933
I wasn't so impressed
with James.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.967
This was such a big leap
from what we've seen

11:15.033 --> 11:16.867
in the past
on these challenges

11:16.933 --> 11:18.733
that I'm really happy
with the field.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.300
[Oliver] As far as
use of shading,

11:20.367 --> 11:22.733
I really like a handful of them.

11:22.800 --> 11:25.100
We all have our favorite.
I think we're good.

11:25.167 --> 11:27.467
Yeah, yeah.
I'm right there with you guys.

11:27.533 --> 11:28.333
Let's go do it.

11:29.367 --> 11:30.533
Alright, guys,

11:30.600 --> 11:32.567
so this Flash Challenge
was clearly about shading.

11:32.633 --> 11:34.167
Everybody did
really well here.

11:37.667 --> 11:40.267
You know, I really, really
enjoyed Bili's painting.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.767
Super creative, man.

11:41.833 --> 11:45.133
You blended it out nice,
and it looks really good.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.900
Lea, the style you did--

11:46.967 --> 11:49.000
it really looked like
a classic painting.

11:49.067 --> 11:49.967
Nice job.

11:51.433 --> 11:53.433
But as you know,
we can only select one.

11:56.033 --> 11:58.467
And the artist that stood out
for us the most...

12:04.300 --> 12:05.300
...was Al.

12:05.367 --> 12:08.433
[applause]

12:08.500 --> 12:10.833
And you will have
the first selection

12:10.900 --> 12:12.133
of your canvas

12:12.200 --> 12:13.700
for the elimination tattoo,

12:13.767 --> 12:16.600
which, as you know,
is a huge advantage.

12:16.667 --> 12:18.367
All I can say, Al,
is I think it's just

12:18.433 --> 12:20.067
a very, very
unique approach.

12:20.133 --> 12:22.500
It's the simplest idea
that nobody would've thought of.

12:22.567 --> 12:25.300
Finally, I got one.
One up for Al Fliction.

12:25.367 --> 12:28.300
I took 'em to school,
I thought outside the box,

12:28.367 --> 12:29.633
and it was an art lesson.

12:29.700 --> 12:31.567
Time to go back
to the Brownstone.

12:31.633 --> 12:33.633
Get ready to meet
your next canvases

12:33.700 --> 12:36.000
that will be used
in the elimination tattoo.

12:36.067 --> 12:38.033
Thanks a lot.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.867
[Bili] If Al doesn't end up
tattooing forever,

12:39.933 --> 12:40.900
he should sell cars,

12:40.967 --> 12:42.767
'cause he's giving
these guys a line.

12:42.833 --> 12:44.067
It's time for Al to go home.

12:48.333 --> 12:50.533
You got elements
of the [bleep] thing wrong,

12:50.600 --> 12:51.700
you're missing [bleep].

12:51.767 --> 12:54.200
No, they don't!
You're full of [bleep].

12:54.267 --> 12:56.300
The winner of this thing
has to hit it all.

12:56.367 --> 12:59.467
You can't [bleep] the bed
in one place,

12:59.533 --> 13:00.867
and be great at the other.

13:02.567 --> 13:04.733
[upbeat music playing]

13:06.200 --> 13:07.167
Yeah, Al.

13:07.233 --> 13:09.000
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, man.

13:09.067 --> 13:10.333
-That was [bleep] amazing.
-I appreciate it.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.400
We were supposed
to show shading.

13:12.467 --> 13:15.067
Al painted half of her black,
and he didn't really blend it.

13:15.133 --> 13:16.400
It was beautiful.

13:16.467 --> 13:18.033
You know,
even if he blended it,

13:18.100 --> 13:20.333
maybe that would
count for something.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.833
-It's a stupid idea.
-Yeah. It's a cop-out.

13:22.900 --> 13:24.100
You could do that
in 20 minutes.

13:24.167 --> 13:25.067
Yeah.

13:25.133 --> 13:27.933
He did a good job
of [bleep] talking

13:28.000 --> 13:30.200
to get what he wanted
out of that situation.

13:30.267 --> 13:32.333
He needs the advantage
anyway, so...

13:32.400 --> 13:33.767
I don't--
I don't care either way.

13:33.833 --> 13:35.200
Let him get his time
to shine, you know.

13:35.267 --> 13:37.167
I looked back,
and I was like,

13:37.233 --> 13:38.767
"What the hell did he do?"

13:49.133 --> 13:50.567
In this week's
elimination tattoo,

13:50.633 --> 13:52.300
we'll be using only black.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.367
You'll be able to dilute
your ink, make it gray.

13:56.433 --> 13:59.133
Black and gray is one of
the oldest forms of tattooing.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.067
Most black and gray
is derived from,

14:01.133 --> 14:04.767
you know, old prison-style,
working with a single needle.

14:04.833 --> 14:06.367
We're testing you
on shading,

14:06.433 --> 14:08.333
so your final product
should look three-dimensional.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.300
When you say,
"Black and gray,"

14:10.367 --> 14:11.733
we're talking about
watered-down black,

14:11.800 --> 14:13.700
not opaque gray
or the color gray.

14:13.767 --> 14:17.033
I do a ton of black and gray,
so I'm pretty comfortable.

14:17.100 --> 14:18.300
You know,
I'm not really worried.

14:18.367 --> 14:20.967
So let's meet your canvases.
Come on in, guys.

14:21.033 --> 14:22.267
[upbeat music]

14:28.367 --> 14:29.300
[Dave] Alright, Al.

14:29.367 --> 14:30.833
Because you won
the Flash Challenge,

14:30.900 --> 14:33.467
you get your pick
of human canvas.

14:33.533 --> 14:35.133
Go ahead
and make your selection.

14:39.233 --> 14:40.333
What do you have in mind?

14:40.400 --> 14:42.267
I'd like to get
a Baku on my head.

14:42.333 --> 14:43.633
You're trying to go
your full head?

14:43.700 --> 14:45.033
-Yes, I'd like my whole...
-Wow.

14:45.100 --> 14:47.367
Last week, Bili didn't
finish his tattoo.

14:47.433 --> 14:49.433
To try to squeeze
a whole head tattoo

14:49.500 --> 14:50.667
in six hours, and rush,

14:50.733 --> 14:52.367
to me is a no-no.

14:53.367 --> 14:54.633
Well, good luck with that.

14:55.433 --> 14:56.467
How about you?

14:56.533 --> 14:57.600
I'm gonna get a heart,
and some angels

14:57.667 --> 14:59.600
trying to pull it
up towards heaven,

14:59.667 --> 15:01.967
and some demons trying
to pull it towards hell.

15:03.633 --> 15:05.867
What kind of tattoo
are you looking to get?

15:05.933 --> 15:07.433
Um, getting a wooden cross
across my back.

15:07.500 --> 15:08.533
I see, I see.

15:09.967 --> 15:10.800
Um...

15:12.467 --> 15:14.667
Think I'll go
with the big guy.

15:14.733 --> 15:16.433
[Dave] There you go.
Al and Devon.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.367
[applause]

15:19.600 --> 15:21.667
Being I'm an artist
from the Inner City,

15:21.733 --> 15:24.167
I felt that I should pick
the dark-skinned client

15:24.233 --> 15:26.467
because I'm used to tattooing
darker-skinned people.

15:26.533 --> 15:27.933
From what
we've seen so far,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.133
Al's shading has been
a little rough.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.300
And you can hide that
on darker skin,

15:32.367 --> 15:34.733
so maybe that's
his strategy.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.000
The rest of the human canvases
will, one by one,

15:37.067 --> 15:38.700
pick up a skull that has
your name under it.

15:38.767 --> 15:40.733
The canvas that draws your name
will be your client.

15:40.800 --> 15:41.833
Let's get started.

15:41.900 --> 15:43.333
This is Dan down here.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.933
-You want a head tattoo.
-Yes.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.700
Wow, another head tattoo.

15:47.467 --> 15:48.500
Pick up a skull.

15:55.967 --> 15:59.167
-Bili.
-[Dave] Bili. Wow.

15:59.233 --> 16:02.200
[applause]
Son of a [bleep].

16:02.267 --> 16:05.500
I cannot believe that Bili
got another head tattoo.

16:05.567 --> 16:08.600
That's a one-in-a-million
situation.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.800
I was pretty excited last week
about doing the head,

16:10.867 --> 16:12.533
but it was really,
really difficult.

16:13.633 --> 16:14.567
[bleep]

16:17.567 --> 16:20.233
We need to see
finished tattoos.

16:20.300 --> 16:21.533
Bad choice.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.500
Two head tattoos in a row,
I'm just kind of screwed.

16:24.567 --> 16:25.700
[Dave] Sam, come on up.

16:27.600 --> 16:28.400
Josh.

16:29.933 --> 16:30.733
Heather.

16:31.633 --> 16:32.433
Shane.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.400
James.

16:34.467 --> 16:35.533
Lea.

16:37.333 --> 16:39.000
-Tommy.
-There you go.

16:39.067 --> 16:40.100
That's me, kid.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.200
Alright, dude.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.033
Hoo-rah.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.500
You have the rest
of the afternoon

16:44.567 --> 16:47.133
to talk with your canvases
and come up with a design.

16:47.200 --> 16:51.367
And tomorrow, another five hours
to complete this tattoo.

16:51.433 --> 16:52.900
Keep in mind there's
a lot on the line.

16:52.967 --> 16:54.800
Tattoos with
shading and depth

16:54.867 --> 16:58.400
will definitely get you
closer to that $100 thousand.

16:58.467 --> 17:00.500
So, go ahead
and meet your canvases.

17:00.567 --> 17:01.833
-What's up, dude?
-Hey.

17:01.900 --> 17:03.100
-How are you?
-Good.

17:03.167 --> 17:05.000
Shading is being able

17:05.067 --> 17:06.733
to make something go
from dark to light,

17:06.800 --> 17:07.933
light to dark.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.267
Shading breathes life
into tattooing.

17:10.333 --> 17:11.666
It creates depth,

17:11.733 --> 17:13.467
so that something
doesn't look flat.

17:13.532 --> 17:16.767
You give it a three-D feel
when you add shading.

17:16.833 --> 17:20.099
I want a robotic arm made
primarily with

17:20.166 --> 17:22.967
the inner workings of kitchen
mixers and kitchen tools.

17:23.032 --> 17:24.200
[Shane] Are you a chef?

17:24.267 --> 17:26.000
'Yeah, I own my own
baking company in Brooklyn.

17:26.067 --> 17:27.000
Alright.

17:27.067 --> 17:28.567
I like all different
kinds of ideas.

17:28.633 --> 17:30.200
Snakes are cool,
dragons are cool,

17:30.267 --> 17:32.000
things that
symbolize strength.

17:32.067 --> 17:34.433
My canvas wants
a flea market on his arm.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.700
I have a lucky number,
which is 29.

17:36.767 --> 17:37.867
If it's real easy,

17:37.933 --> 17:39.900
just to get the number 29
in there somewhere.

17:39.967 --> 17:42.133
Hell, these people
want to put all this stuff

17:42.200 --> 17:43.867
into one little tattoo.

17:45.267 --> 17:47.600
I don't have a whole lot
of black and gray in there,

17:47.667 --> 17:49.733
but, uh,
it all starts with black.

17:49.800 --> 17:52.400
Black and gray is my weakest
area of tattooing.

17:52.467 --> 17:54.167
I feel like I'm labeled
as the color guy,

17:54.233 --> 17:55.567
'cause that's just,
you know,

17:55.633 --> 17:57.267
what I've done
through my career.

17:57.333 --> 17:58.600
So, what... what are
some of your ideas, here?

17:58.667 --> 18:01.100
I really want to get
angels protecting my heart.

18:01.167 --> 18:04.000
The angels kind of
pulling it up towards heaven,

18:04.067 --> 18:06.133
devils trying
to drag it down.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.633
I don't know if you've ever
seen the Sistine Chapel.

18:09.567 --> 18:11.000
So, the Sistine Chapel

18:11.067 --> 18:13.067
the art on there
is kind of what inspired me.

18:13.133 --> 18:16.667
That's a huge ceiling.
This is a tiny forearm.

18:16.733 --> 18:18.033
I'm pretty nervous
about this one,

18:18.100 --> 18:19.467
'cause this, if any one,

18:19.533 --> 18:21.600
could be the one
that I get sent home with.

18:23.733 --> 18:25.367
So, what are we
looking to do?

18:25.433 --> 18:27.000
What I'm looking at is

18:27.067 --> 18:30.400
a Celtic band,
connecting that around,

18:30.467 --> 18:33.667
and then on top of that
is a skyline of New York.

18:33.733 --> 18:34.767
I have kind of like a--

18:34.833 --> 18:37.400
-Okay.
-My own version of it.

18:37.467 --> 18:39.233
When a tattoo's
so tight like that,

18:39.300 --> 18:42.267
it's hard to show the grayscales
of the black and gray.

18:42.333 --> 18:44.867
These are way too small,
these buildings.

18:44.933 --> 18:47.000
It can't just be
dark gray to light gray,

18:47.067 --> 18:48.400
it's got to be
from black to white.

18:48.467 --> 18:50.200
Imagine bringing
the band down here.

18:50.267 --> 18:51.900
Because then you
have a nice area

18:51.967 --> 18:54.167
for us to put
a Nice skyline in.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.433
But to have all skyline
takes away from the Celtic band.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.400
If you notice,
it's not so much New York City,

18:58.467 --> 19:00.167
it's the Celtic band,
and then the New York--

19:00.233 --> 19:01.600
And then New York.

19:01.667 --> 19:03.833
He was pretty dead-set
on getting that drawing done.

19:03.900 --> 19:06.867
My thing is the buildings
are so [bleep] small.

19:06.933 --> 19:08.467
So, then make
the band wider.

19:08.533 --> 19:10.467
No, no, no,
what I'm trying to figure out is

19:10.533 --> 19:11.500
I'm trying to--

19:11.567 --> 19:12.800
I just got to lay out
the buildings

19:12.867 --> 19:13.867
a little differently.

19:16.100 --> 19:18.833
Where, uh--like, where
on your head were you thinking?

19:18.900 --> 19:21.267
Everything that is covered
by hair right now,

19:21.333 --> 19:23.967
I would like to be
covered by tattoo.

19:24.033 --> 19:25.700
Bili looks distraught.

19:25.767 --> 19:27.467
He has that "I'm going home"
look on his face.

19:27.533 --> 19:29.167
Once he failed
the first time,

19:29.233 --> 19:31.433
I don't think the judges
are gonna give him a pass.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.300
That's what
we attempted yesterday,

19:33.367 --> 19:34.333
and we couldn't finish.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.433
-Mm-hmm.
-It's just too much.

19:35.500 --> 19:38.467
So, maybe focus on one area.

19:38.533 --> 19:40.967
We could either do a side panel
or the whole top.

19:41.033 --> 19:42.300
I actually don't like
either of those looks.

19:42.367 --> 19:43.333
Neither. Okay.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.667
I would like
to have it look, like,

19:45.733 --> 19:48.067
that I've got
a head of hair, basically.

19:48.133 --> 19:49.900
Right, um...

19:49.967 --> 19:51.333
The only thing working
against me

19:51.400 --> 19:52.533
at this point is my client.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.167
Because of him,
I'm putting myself at risk.

19:55.233 --> 19:56.500
Hmm, this is a tough one.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.533
The client, he was like,
really, like, picky last night.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.067
Like, he's like,
"I want it to be

20:09.133 --> 20:12.567
new school, Japanese,
and realistic."

20:12.633 --> 20:14.167
Bili is complaining
all the time.

20:14.233 --> 20:15.767
Every tattoo I've done,
I've started

20:15.833 --> 20:17.833
at a minimum
an hour late.

20:17.900 --> 20:21.167
I'm tired of hearing him whine
about this competition,

20:21.233 --> 20:24.433
and the rules, and the judging,
and, you know...

20:24.500 --> 20:26.067
You signed up for this.

20:26.133 --> 20:27.467
The door's right there.

20:27.533 --> 20:29.567
Don't let it hit you
on the way out, Bili.

20:32.167 --> 20:33.167
Morning, guys.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.633
It's time for you all
to get to work,

20:34.700 --> 20:36.467
and put your shading skills
to the test

20:36.533 --> 20:38.633
with a Nice
black-and-gray tattoo.

20:38.700 --> 20:40.833
You have five hours
to complete your work,

20:40.900 --> 20:43.267
and today, the judges will be
looking for the three-D aspects

20:43.333 --> 20:45.767
that your shading
technique produces.

20:45.833 --> 20:47.467
Tattoo isn't
packed with depth,

20:47.533 --> 20:49.933
you'll be packing your machines
and going home.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.600
The clock starts right now.

20:54.667 --> 20:57.033
When people refer
to "black-and-gray tattoos,"

20:57.100 --> 21:00.267
you're just using black ink
and diluted black ink

21:00.333 --> 21:01.633
to make soft shades of gray,

21:01.700 --> 21:04.000
so shading is very important
'cause it has to be smooth,

21:04.067 --> 21:05.300
and it has to be soft.

21:05.367 --> 21:06.767
The shading
has to be just right,

21:06.833 --> 21:08.233
or the tattoo is gonna look

21:08.300 --> 21:09.533
terrible and flat.

21:10.533 --> 21:11.433
I'm excited about this.

21:12.467 --> 21:13.800
It's, like,
right on the money.

21:17.400 --> 21:20.567
I think it's--
this claw is throwing me off.

21:20.633 --> 21:22.067
-Too hand-like?
-Yeah.

21:22.133 --> 21:23.633
My stencils
are very complex.

21:23.700 --> 21:25.433
I put a lot of information
and detail into them.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.400
I think that this scared
the hell out of my client,

21:27.467 --> 21:29.367
and he started
freaking out a little bit.

21:29.433 --> 21:30.700
Alright,
we'll fix that real quick.

21:30.767 --> 21:32.300
That's fine.
Don't worry about it.

21:32.367 --> 21:34.933
If not, you know,
we can throw it here.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.167
-Okay.
-Or put it here.

21:36.233 --> 21:37.700
It is a design
that I like,

21:37.767 --> 21:39.900
I just don't know
if it's a design

21:39.967 --> 21:41.900
that I would want
to put on my head.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.100
This client was very picky,
very uncertain.

21:45.167 --> 21:47.333
My clients are gonna be
the death of me.

21:49.700 --> 21:52.100
It's still impressive
to me to go from this...

21:52.167 --> 21:54.133
-Mm-hmm.
-And then to go to that.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.433
I'm not super happy
with the design.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.800
It was a challenge
to put it together.

21:57.867 --> 22:00.100
He was pretty dead-set
on getting that done.

22:00.167 --> 22:02.500
Really enhanced that idea.
I really like that, man.

22:02.567 --> 22:03.533
Cool.

22:03.600 --> 22:04.867
I know Tommy's
gonna do it perfectly,

22:04.933 --> 22:06.633
but there's not enough
elements in that design

22:06.700 --> 22:07.867
to show off, like,

22:07.933 --> 22:09.967
really
solid black and gray skills.

22:10.033 --> 22:11.533
You know,
I feel frustrated.

22:11.600 --> 22:14.067
It could potentially screw me up
in this challenge.

22:14.133 --> 22:16.833
He's playing with fire.
You know, he's asking for it.

22:22.700 --> 22:25.633
I'll gray wash up,
you know, around here.

22:25.700 --> 22:27.033
-Yeah.
-And then up.

22:27.100 --> 22:29.133
What does the "gray wash"
actually mean?

22:36.267 --> 22:37.867
I prefer to do color,

22:37.933 --> 22:40.400
but I'm pretty confident
in my black and gray.

22:41.433 --> 22:43.733
Alright, guys,
four hours to go.

22:45.400 --> 22:46.733
We're an hour
into the challenge,

22:46.800 --> 22:47.900
and he still hasn't
made up his mind,

22:47.967 --> 22:50.267
and I'm starting to worry
that he may never.

22:50.333 --> 22:52.333
Screw this.
You're losing time on this.

22:52.400 --> 22:53.533
Let's put an orb there,

22:53.600 --> 22:55.633
then have a couple of claws
grabbed around.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.067
-Okay.
-Should be pretty simple.

22:57.133 --> 22:58.300
-And then, uh...
-Go thigh?

22:58.367 --> 22:59.800
Let's go for
right on my thigh.

22:59.867 --> 23:02.167
After all of the discussions,
and all of the changes,

23:02.233 --> 23:03.833
we agreed
on the original idea.

23:03.900 --> 23:05.400
But we're putting it
on a thigh.

23:05.467 --> 23:08.167
I'm irritated, because he wasted
a lot of my time,

23:08.233 --> 23:09.833
and time's running out.

23:09.900 --> 23:12.167
Do you need help
sliding this out of the way?

23:15.733 --> 23:18.133
I'm feeling good.
Black and gray is my thing.

23:18.200 --> 23:19.700
It's one of
my strong points.

23:19.767 --> 23:21.867
I think I'm safe
in this one.

23:21.933 --> 23:24.933
Al has been bragging about
how good his black and gray is.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.533
I think he bit off
more than he could chew

23:26.600 --> 23:27.867
with this tattoo.

23:27.933 --> 23:31.000
In that amount of time,
you cannot get a tattoo that big

23:31.067 --> 23:32.967
shaded really smooth.

23:33.033 --> 23:35.700
He wanted a Wood cross
to represent his mom.

23:35.767 --> 23:36.900
His mom passed away,

23:36.967 --> 23:38.400
so he's putting in
a Wood cross,

23:38.467 --> 23:40.233
right, I mean, like,
growing from a tree.

23:40.300 --> 23:43.367
And we put some, like, pearly
gates, kind of, in front of it.

23:43.433 --> 23:44.600
I've asked, and begged,

23:44.667 --> 23:46.433
and pleaded
with these contestants

23:46.500 --> 23:49.467
to slow down,
be precise, be clean.

23:49.533 --> 23:52.933
You don't have to do a huge
tattoo to do a good tattoo.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.467
[Dave] Two hours left,
everybody.

23:56.633 --> 23:59.533
I really want to have this,
like, super [bleep] nice.

23:59.600 --> 24:01.467
-Mm-hmm.
-You know?

24:01.533 --> 24:03.400
And I don't want
to rush on anything.

24:03.467 --> 24:06.200
William wants something
a little bit bigger

24:06.267 --> 24:08.067
than what I think
I'm gonna be able to do

24:08.133 --> 24:09.333
if I want to really do

24:09.400 --> 24:11.933
beautiful, beautiful detail
on it for him.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
Can we do this,
see if we have the time...

24:15.067 --> 24:17.167
And get to that next?
Okay, yeah.

24:17.233 --> 24:19.267
-Is that... yeah?
-Yeah. Yeah, that's fine.

24:23.233 --> 24:25.167
It's definitely
a little unnerving

24:25.233 --> 24:27.200
to go into black and gray
up against Shane O'Neill.

24:27.267 --> 24:28.633
He's one of the top artists

24:28.700 --> 24:29.900
in the country
doing black and gray.

24:29.967 --> 24:31.600
You know,
when I started tattooing,

24:31.667 --> 24:33.933
I was immediately
drawn to black and gray.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.867
-When I picked your name...
-Mm-hmm.

24:35.933 --> 24:37.933
I was like,
"[bleep] yeah."

24:38.000 --> 24:39.767
'Cause I've admired
your work for a while.

24:39.833 --> 24:41.067
Oh, awesome, man.

24:41.133 --> 24:43.167
I like his ideas, incorporating
all the Baker's tools.

24:43.233 --> 24:44.767
There are some
cool elements in there

24:44.833 --> 24:46.833
I'll be able to display,
like, really smooth shading.

24:46.900 --> 24:48.867
I feel like I have
an opportunity to win one now.

24:50.100 --> 24:51.600
One hour left, everybody.

24:51.667 --> 24:52.833
[intense music playing]

24:57.800 --> 24:58.900
I'm really nervous

24:58.967 --> 25:00.700
about how I'm gonna make
all this come to life.

25:00.767 --> 25:03.867
Tiny angels and demons,
and really little details--

25:03.933 --> 25:04.933
that's not me.

25:06.933 --> 25:09.000
You don't deal much
in black and gray, huh?

25:09.067 --> 25:12.033
I do, but they're usually,
like, portraits, you know?

25:12.100 --> 25:13.600
I can do black and gray.

25:13.667 --> 25:16.033
I just don't choose
to do it all the time.

25:16.100 --> 25:19.033
This definitely took me out
of my comfort zone, you know?

25:19.100 --> 25:21.400
An Ink Master is somebody
who's well-rounded.

25:21.467 --> 25:24.200
They're versatile,
and they can do anything.

25:24.267 --> 25:26.267
He's done really bold,
heavy tattoos,

25:26.333 --> 25:29.200
with big, thick outlines,
and big, thick color,

25:29.267 --> 25:31.733
but you ask him to do
some smooth, soft shading,

25:31.800 --> 25:34.167
and it's a new tattooer
sitting in that room.

25:35.333 --> 25:36.800
[Dave] Thirty minutes left.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.100
[Bili] With the late start,

25:40.167 --> 25:41.400
there's some things
I'd like to do.

25:41.467 --> 25:42.433
There's a lot
of white highlights

25:42.500 --> 25:44.000
that I'm not gonna get to.

25:44.067 --> 25:46.733
Bili working on
some sort of Japanese--

25:46.800 --> 25:47.900
I don't know
what you'd call it,

25:47.967 --> 25:49.767
if it's a god, or Baku.

25:49.833 --> 25:51.833
I personally feel
he went a little too dark.

25:51.900 --> 25:54.467
It's gonna be hard to get
a decent tattoo out of that.

25:57.967 --> 25:59.100
One minute left.

25:59.167 --> 26:00.100
[suspense music]

26:03.400 --> 26:05.367
Here's the 30-second mark,
everybody.

26:09.533 --> 26:11.567
Still hearing
a lot of machines going.

26:11.633 --> 26:12.533
Ten.

26:14.333 --> 26:15.300
Five seconds.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.533
Alright, guys,
that's it, time's up.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.133
Put your machines down.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.433
-Whew.
-No more ink.

26:22.500 --> 26:25.367
-Yeah, that looks great.
-I don't want to go home.

26:25.433 --> 26:26.667
I don't think
you're going home.

26:26.733 --> 26:29.333
-This is friggin' hot, Shane.
-Yeah? Awesome, man.

26:29.400 --> 26:33.167
There's some not smooth
black-and-gray stuff out there.

26:33.233 --> 26:34.700
From a competitor's
point of view,

26:34.767 --> 26:37.033
I'm thrilled that in the
Black-and-Gray Challenge,

26:37.100 --> 26:40.067
my piece kicked the [bleep]
out of everybody else's.

26:40.133 --> 26:43.267
I'm pretty nervous on how
the critiquing is gonna go.

26:43.333 --> 26:46.400
This one could be the one
that I get sent home with.

26:48.667 --> 26:50.333
Don't pull this [bleep]
right now!

26:50.400 --> 26:51.967
Oh, and your Statue of Liberty,

26:52.033 --> 26:53.267
that beat-up
looking [bleep]?

26:53.333 --> 26:55.033
Just be real.
If it was me, I'd be real.

26:55.100 --> 26:56.600
I'd be like,
"Yo, I [bleep] up."

27:03.400 --> 27:04.633
I was buggin' out
like 20 minutes into it.

27:04.700 --> 27:05.833
Like, my eyes weren't
working right,

27:05.900 --> 27:07.267
and I was like,

27:07.333 --> 27:09.333
"You got to be kidding me, like,
I'm gonna have to take a break?"

27:09.400 --> 27:11.167
My eyes kept, like,
slamming shut,

27:11.233 --> 27:12.633
and he was like,
"Are you all right?"

27:12.700 --> 27:13.667
And I was just like...

27:14.867 --> 27:17.167
Whoever wins this
earned that [bleep], man.

27:17.233 --> 27:18.467
You earned it.

27:18.533 --> 27:19.967
[upbeat music]

27:33.033 --> 27:35.633
Welcome to
the night's elimination.

27:35.700 --> 27:36.833
Al, you're up first.

27:40.167 --> 27:41.600
Are you happy with this?

27:41.667 --> 27:44.733
[Al] Yeah, man, I mean,
it was right up my alley, man.

27:44.800 --> 27:47.100
The wooden cross
with the pearly gates of heaven.

27:48.733 --> 27:50.200
[Oliver] I'm not entirely
convinced that

27:50.267 --> 27:51.200
anybody would...

27:51.267 --> 27:52.900
...would think
that was a fence.

27:55.167 --> 27:56.933
It's like Swiss cheese
at the bottom.

27:58.767 --> 27:59.967
[Al] I love that part.

28:00.033 --> 28:01.800
It's my interpretation,
though--

28:01.867 --> 28:03.033
-Your interpretation?
-Of the pearly gates.

28:03.100 --> 28:04.367
We don't know
what they look like.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.067
I'm just trying
to stay more focused

28:06.133 --> 28:08.267
towards the challenge,
also, and use the light,

28:08.333 --> 28:09.833
and use the gray tones.

28:09.900 --> 28:13.267
The shading is not there.

28:13.333 --> 28:15.800
You just don't have
any good examples

28:15.867 --> 28:17.300
of a smooth gradient.

28:17.367 --> 28:20.200
From dark to light,
smooth, from black,

28:20.267 --> 28:22.300
fading to gray,
fading to the skin,

28:22.367 --> 28:24.133
and fading
back into ink again.

28:26.500 --> 28:28.100
This was
your time to shine.

28:28.167 --> 28:30.800
'Cause yesterday you understood
what the test was.

28:30.867 --> 28:32.233
You defined shade.

28:32.300 --> 28:33.933
Like, you killed it.

28:35.467 --> 28:37.433
Why not today,
when it counts?

28:43.667 --> 28:44.667
[Dave] Alright, Lea.

28:47.533 --> 28:48.967
How do you feel
you did this week?

28:49.033 --> 28:50.600
I'm happy with it.

28:50.667 --> 28:52.267
[Oliver]
I would have liked to see

28:52.333 --> 28:55.267
a little more transition
from black to gray.

28:55.333 --> 28:57.667
Seems like you put
all the black in some spots,

28:57.733 --> 28:59.733
all the gray
in other spots.

28:59.800 --> 29:02.700
Practice with working
those grays out, extending them.

29:02.767 --> 29:05.567
[Chris] You did a tattoo
that was the right size,

29:05.633 --> 29:07.233
rode well
on your client's arm.

29:07.300 --> 29:08.700
You did a great job.

29:08.767 --> 29:09.633
Thanks.

29:11.667 --> 29:12.533
James.

29:15.133 --> 29:16.333
Black and gray is tricky.

29:18.467 --> 29:21.733
You have to use many tones
of darks and lights

29:21.800 --> 29:23.100
to build your depth.

29:23.167 --> 29:25.333
It's hard for me
to read this tattoo.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.400
On one side,
it's universally light,

29:27.467 --> 29:28.567
with the fire,

29:28.633 --> 29:30.633
on the other side,
it's majorly dark.

29:30.700 --> 29:32.200
The foo dog itself--

29:32.267 --> 29:34.600
There's just
a lot of black in it.

29:34.667 --> 29:37.667
Most of the darker--
male foo dogs are dark, so...

29:37.733 --> 29:41.500
You did black in the head,
and you did black in the body,

29:41.567 --> 29:42.967
but it's black.

29:43.033 --> 29:45.867
There's very
minimal transition.

29:45.933 --> 29:48.367
It just makes it,
overall, look flat.

29:48.433 --> 29:51.033
I just think you're
cutting your nose off your face.

29:57.033 --> 29:58.167
Shane.

30:03.267 --> 30:06.333
I'm loving
the black-and-gray work,

30:06.400 --> 30:08.967
and the drop shadow
on the skin.

30:09.033 --> 30:10.767
Thank you.

30:10.833 --> 30:13.467
You've been hearing me say
I want to see transition

30:13.533 --> 30:15.700
from dark to light,

30:15.767 --> 30:18.000
and there is a handful of areas
in this tattoo

30:18.067 --> 30:19.433
that do that exactly.

30:19.500 --> 30:22.100
It goes from dark
all the way into light,

30:22.167 --> 30:23.233
and back into the dark

30:23.300 --> 30:24.567
when it goes back
into the grater.

30:24.633 --> 30:27.533
This is what black and gray
is supposed to look like.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.433
You hit it.

30:28.500 --> 30:29.433
Good job.

30:29.500 --> 30:30.400
Thank you.

30:33.967 --> 30:34.767
[Dave] Bili.

30:38.567 --> 30:40.533
What happened?
I want to hear your--

30:40.600 --> 30:42.833
Well, he came thinking
we could do the whole head.

30:42.900 --> 30:44.000
Today when we got in,

30:44.067 --> 30:45.900
we made
a few simple modifications,

30:45.967 --> 30:49.000
but by that time,
he had just been contemplating,

30:49.067 --> 30:51.067
and kind of knew that we were
running out of time,

30:51.133 --> 30:52.367
and, you know,
made the call,

30:52.433 --> 30:54.233
we're gonna have to switch it
and put it on the leg.

30:54.300 --> 30:56.067
[Chris] It's not even finished.

30:56.133 --> 30:58.367
It doesn't have front teeth
'cause you blacked 'em out.

30:58.433 --> 30:59.933
[Bili] Actually,
an elephant's top teeth

31:00.000 --> 31:01.133
aren't very visible
from that angle.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.233
Actually, this part right here
would have teeth

31:03.300 --> 31:05.800
because it only has
the trunk that comes off.

31:05.867 --> 31:07.233
On the real Japanese design.

31:07.300 --> 31:09.100
But as the trunk casts
a shadow over the front teeth--

31:09.167 --> 31:10.667
Dude, we'll get
any Google image

31:10.733 --> 31:11.700
you want up right now.

31:11.767 --> 31:13.900
This is just
traditional Japanese.

31:13.967 --> 31:16.133
But the client asked for me
to take different elements

31:16.200 --> 31:18.300
of the traditional
Japanese--

31:18.367 --> 31:20.733
He wanted
more of an elephant face.

31:20.800 --> 31:23.600
He also wanted to give it
more tiger-like ears.

31:23.667 --> 31:25.900
I'll say that ear
looks more like a Dorito chip

31:25.967 --> 31:27.233
than a tiger ear.

31:29.833 --> 31:31.067
No spots, no tail,
no nothing.

31:31.133 --> 31:32.433
Didn't ask for 'em.
Didn't want 'em.

31:32.500 --> 31:34.500
The tail, actually,
would not be visible

31:34.567 --> 31:35.667
if it was--

31:35.733 --> 31:36.867
if it was coming out of
a black cavern.

31:36.933 --> 31:39.933
Dude, you've come close
on a lot of tattoos,

31:40.000 --> 31:40.900
but this tattoo is--

31:40.967 --> 31:42.600
this doesn't look like
you did it.

31:48.767 --> 31:49.800
Hey, Tommy.

31:53.667 --> 31:54.767
Let's take a look
at the work.

31:55.800 --> 31:56.967
[Oliver] I'm really pleased

31:57.033 --> 31:59.467
at the shading you did
in the background,

31:59.533 --> 32:03.400
in the sky, gradients,
very soft and smooth.

32:03.467 --> 32:04.867
The buildings--

32:04.933 --> 32:06.633
putting some buildings
further in the background--

32:06.700 --> 32:08.200
it looks like it.

32:08.267 --> 32:11.267
The face
of the Statue of Liberty...

32:11.333 --> 32:13.533
I feel like
you kind of lost

32:13.600 --> 32:15.300
the shape of the face
a little bit.

32:16.533 --> 32:17.700
I think yeah,

32:17.767 --> 32:18.833
you could've done a little bit
more with the face

32:18.900 --> 32:20.167
just to toughen it up.

32:21.133 --> 32:22.467
Just a little bit stronger.

32:22.533 --> 32:24.567
A little bit
more black in there.

32:24.633 --> 32:25.800
Thank you, gentlemen.

32:29.000 --> 32:29.800
Heather.

32:32.667 --> 32:34.767
Your work here.
What are your thoughts?

32:34.833 --> 32:37.933
I think it's a good tattoo,
I think it's a decent tattoo.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.767
[Oliver] The shading
is just not soft.

32:40.833 --> 32:44.067
It's not the feminine,
delicate softness

32:44.133 --> 32:47.833
that this design really needed
to just knock it up a notch.

32:51.967 --> 32:52.867
Josh.

32:54.900 --> 32:56.400
So, you happy
with this piece?

32:56.467 --> 32:58.300
Yeah.

32:58.367 --> 33:01.167
It's definitely
something different for me.

33:01.233 --> 33:03.400
A lot of tiny,
little detailed faces.

33:04.333 --> 33:05.967
As far as
the shading goes,

33:06.033 --> 33:08.300
it's probably darker
than it should've been.

33:08.367 --> 33:10.500
There's no foreground,
there's no background,

33:10.567 --> 33:14.000
there's no dimension
being brought forward.

33:14.067 --> 33:17.367
The areas that are black
are black, and it fades out.

33:17.433 --> 33:18.733
This whole forearm

33:18.800 --> 33:20.867
is just one big,
solid area of darkness.

33:21.933 --> 33:23.300
You do big,
huge tattoos--

33:23.367 --> 33:24.433
they're bright,
they're colorful,

33:24.500 --> 33:26.433
but this is about
being well-rounded.

33:26.500 --> 33:27.800
Your tattoo today,

33:27.867 --> 33:30.133
you didn't hit this
Black-and-Gray Challenge.

33:32.933 --> 33:35.567
The winner of this thing
has to hit it all.

33:35.633 --> 33:38.100
You can't [bleep] the bed
in one place,

33:38.167 --> 33:39.700
and be great at the other.

33:41.567 --> 33:42.900
You know,
you're the last guy up,

33:42.967 --> 33:44.267
so I'm gonna say
where it's coming from.

33:44.333 --> 33:47.700
But you've got to be able
to hit on all cylinders.

33:50.567 --> 33:53.300
And guys, this is building
to a bigger project.

33:53.367 --> 33:55.867
Every week that you
get tested on something,

33:55.933 --> 33:58.767
it's 'cause you're gonna have to
use it plus everything else

33:58.833 --> 34:00.900
next week,
so if you can't do this,

34:00.967 --> 34:03.667
then what unhappy customer
are you gonna make next week?

34:05.433 --> 34:06.500
[Dave] Alright, guys.

34:06.567 --> 34:08.433
You can head on down
to the Brownstone.

34:08.500 --> 34:10.199
We'll call you back
when a decision has been made.

34:10.266 --> 34:11.766
[ominous music]

34:17.500 --> 34:20.300
So, how's everybody feel
about the, uh--

34:20.367 --> 34:22.132
the ass whoopings
we just got?

34:22.199 --> 34:23.900
I know I put
smooth shading in there.

34:23.967 --> 34:26.800
From dark to light, back
to negative, you know, like--

34:26.867 --> 34:29.333
-Too dark, man.
-I disagree.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.833
Black and gray--
I've never seen one that dark.

34:31.900 --> 34:33.600
I'm telling you.
That's bull[bleep].

34:33.667 --> 34:35.967
You got elements
of the [bleep] thing wrong,

34:36.033 --> 34:36.933
you're missing [bleep].

34:37.000 --> 34:38.433
Bull[bleep]!

34:38.500 --> 34:39.733
Come on, bro.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.766
Describe a Baku.
Describe Baku. What is Baku?

34:41.833 --> 34:43.867
I don't know
what the [bleep] it is,

34:43.933 --> 34:45.067
-but I know-I know-I know--
-Exactly!

34:45.132 --> 34:47.100
Seventeenth-century book,
Sankai Ibutsu.

34:47.167 --> 34:49.067
Admit it, just be real.
If it was me, I'd be real.

34:49.132 --> 34:50.667
I'd be like,
"Yo, I [bleep] up."

34:50.733 --> 34:53.233
The [bleep] was dark,
the client didn't like it.

34:55.333 --> 34:57.200
[upbeat music]

35:00.933 --> 35:02.033
You go through
heaven's gates,

35:02.100 --> 35:03.733
that did not
look like heaven's gates.

35:03.800 --> 35:05.067
It wasn't-no, I wasn't
supposed to do heaven's gates!

35:05.133 --> 35:06.167
Oh, that was
the artist's interpretation.

35:06.233 --> 35:07.567
You never invented
something as an artist?

35:07.633 --> 35:09.133
You never invented
your own thing?

35:09.200 --> 35:11.233
Tell me the truth, you really
think those look like gates?

35:11.300 --> 35:12.700
-Listen--
-You really do, in your heart.

35:12.767 --> 35:14.033
You're saying to me--

35:14.100 --> 35:16.733
they're my interpretation
of my-- my gates of heaven.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.333
Then you hope
you don't there, man.

35:18.400 --> 35:19.500
'Cause those are [bleep]--
they're not gonna open for ya.

35:19.567 --> 35:20.667
So, what do
they look like? Tom...

35:20.733 --> 35:22.667
-Be honest with yourself.
-I am.

35:22.733 --> 35:24.033
You really think
those look like gates?

35:24.767 --> 35:26.033
To me, yes!

35:26.100 --> 35:27.567
No, they don't!
You're full of [bleep].

35:27.633 --> 35:29.200
-Well, it's my vision of--
-You're so full of [bleep]!

35:29.267 --> 35:32.200
My vision of heaven
is not your vision of heaven!

35:32.267 --> 35:33.167
Look at you, man.

35:33.233 --> 35:35.033
You're full of [bleep]
right now.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.233
Oh, and your
Statue of Liberty--

35:36.300 --> 35:37.367
that beat-up lookin' [bleep]?

35:37.433 --> 35:38.767
You see how you get?

35:38.833 --> 35:40.400
That [bleep] looked like
a [bleep] man, bro!

35:40.467 --> 35:41.500
I'm just sayin'!
You see how you get?

35:41.567 --> 35:42.467
I'll do Statue of Liberty
all day.

35:42.533 --> 35:43.967
You did some
wack-ass [bleep].

35:44.033 --> 35:46.667
That bitch looked like
a transvestite, Tommy.

35:46.733 --> 35:48.233
Time to make a choice.

35:48.300 --> 35:50.933
For me, I think that Lea
killed this one.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.400
That's my personal take.

35:52.467 --> 35:55.200
I think Lea did
an amazing tattoo,

35:55.267 --> 35:57.433
I just think
that Shane's tattoo

35:57.500 --> 36:00.200
displayed the attributes
of what we're testing

36:00.267 --> 36:01.700
in this challenge,
right here, better.

36:01.767 --> 36:02.933
Want to get into Bili?

36:03.000 --> 36:05.833
He didn't
finish the eyes,

36:05.900 --> 36:09.400
he didn't finish
the details in the mane...

36:09.467 --> 36:11.667
-He didn't finish.
-He didn't finish the image.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.467
And then I'm looking
at Josh's tattoo.

36:16.533 --> 36:19.833
[Chris] This was such a drastic
difference from his big, bold--

36:19.900 --> 36:22.500
big color,
new school stuff.

36:22.567 --> 36:26.200
I thought he was
more well-rounded.

36:27.767 --> 36:31.500
I'm really surprised
at how well Al,

36:31.567 --> 36:35.567
in the Flash Challenge,
was able to show shading,

36:35.633 --> 36:38.733
and then as soon as he got
his machine in his hand,

36:38.800 --> 36:41.667
just completely missed
everything he showed us

36:41.733 --> 36:43.333
earlier on in the day.

36:43.400 --> 36:44.733
Conceptually,
all that area in the bottom--

36:44.800 --> 36:47.333
it could've been
light gray fading up

36:47.400 --> 36:50.000
out of that
supposed gate design.

36:50.067 --> 36:54.133
It's just not a field of gray,
it's-it's scribbled in.

36:54.200 --> 36:55.467
You guys feel like

36:55.533 --> 36:56.767
-we're close, here?
-I think-yeah.

36:56.833 --> 36:58.000
Yeah.

36:59.500 --> 37:01.267
Like I said--
like I told him yes--

37:01.333 --> 37:03.000
looking back, I wish
I would've talked him into

37:03.067 --> 37:04.967
just doing one--
one figure up top,

37:05.033 --> 37:06.167
one figure at bottom,

37:06.233 --> 37:07.467
and the [bleep] heart.

37:07.533 --> 37:10.233
-Yo.
-Yo.

37:10.300 --> 37:12.267
[clearing throat]

37:12.333 --> 37:13.900
Judges want to see

37:13.967 --> 37:18.467
Al, Shane, Josh, and Bili.

37:19.267 --> 37:20.433
See you all in the shop.

37:24.633 --> 37:25.933
If I don't get
a chance to say it...

37:26.000 --> 37:28.133
After I go up there,
if I don't see you,

37:28.200 --> 37:29.800
[bleep] you, Tommy.

37:29.867 --> 37:30.733
[bleep] you.

37:38.700 --> 37:39.967
Welcome, guys.

37:40.033 --> 37:41.633
In this week, we've done

37:41.700 --> 37:43.400
the number one slot,
and the bottom three.

37:47.600 --> 37:51.633
Each week the judges choose
who we feel had the best tattoo.

37:52.733 --> 37:53.633
This week...

37:55.500 --> 37:56.833
That goes to Shane.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.967
Thank you.

37:59.033 --> 38:03.633
You did good blacks,
good transition to light gray,

38:03.700 --> 38:05.933
showed some dimension,
showed some shadowing.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.667
Exactly what
we're looking for.

38:09.200 --> 38:12.033
[Dave] The rest of you,
on the other hand, fell short.

38:13.633 --> 38:15.067
The judges feel that,
at this point,

38:15.133 --> 38:17.867
any one of you could
justifiably be sent home.

38:21.033 --> 38:23.800
This competition is covering
many areas of tattooing,

38:23.867 --> 38:27.433
and if you don't have down
the majority of tattoo skills

38:27.500 --> 38:29.033
that are out there,

38:29.100 --> 38:30.700
then this competition is
not for you.

38:32.233 --> 38:33.933
[Chris] I just think you guys
are better than--

38:34.000 --> 38:35.400
than what you're doing.

38:35.467 --> 38:38.533
You're competing
for 100 grand,

38:38.600 --> 38:41.433
and you're gonna do something
that's on somebody forever.

38:41.500 --> 38:42.667
That's the fact.

38:45.667 --> 38:46.500
Josh...

38:49.267 --> 38:50.833
It looks like you kind of
just hard-lined

38:50.900 --> 38:52.700
a bunch of stuff that maybe
didn't need those hard lines,

38:52.767 --> 38:55.533
and you could've come in
and smoothed it out,

38:55.600 --> 38:56.800
and made it slick.

38:56.867 --> 38:59.133
You didn't hit
this Black-and-Gray Challenge.

39:02.033 --> 39:03.067
[Dave] Al Fliction.

39:04.200 --> 39:06.467
There is just not
any good examples

39:06.533 --> 39:09.433
of a smooth gradient
from dark to light.

39:09.500 --> 39:12.033
You know, the dark skin tone
is one of the shades,

39:12.100 --> 39:13.833
so it's different
on the darker skin.

39:13.900 --> 39:17.067
You got to include
his skin color into that blend.

39:17.133 --> 39:19.967
We have some dark areas,
we have some light areas,

39:20.033 --> 39:23.933
but you did not show me,
technically, tattoo-wise,

39:24.000 --> 39:25.567
that you can make that
come to life in the skin.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.667
Bili.

39:29.733 --> 39:34.400
This guy asked for
a specific Japanese image,

39:34.467 --> 39:37.633
and this doesn't really
look like that particular image.

39:37.700 --> 39:38.833
I-- I disagree.

39:40.233 --> 39:41.967
Would you wear it?
Would you wear that tattoo?

39:42.033 --> 39:43.600
Would you put that
on that clean forearm right now?

39:43.667 --> 39:45.033
I don't wear
Japanese tattoos.

39:45.100 --> 39:47.200
You didn't say yes,
which is my problem.

39:47.267 --> 39:48.667
I don't wear
Japanese tattoos.

39:48.733 --> 39:50.733
Great. But would you wear it?
It's your work.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.767
You got to be able to step back
for a second and go,

39:52.833 --> 39:54.100
"Hey, I didn't nail this one."

39:54.167 --> 39:55.367
I disagree entirely.

40:00.867 --> 40:02.333
The judges have decided.

40:10.133 --> 40:12.833
And, Al, you don't have
what it takes to be Ink Master .

40:15.867 --> 40:18.000
[Oliver] What I hope for you
in the future is that

40:18.067 --> 40:20.467
you can take your
tattooing technical ability

40:20.533 --> 40:23.267
up to the same level
of your artistic skill.

40:23.333 --> 40:25.900
Your art and the way
you see things--

40:25.967 --> 40:27.533
you have that.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.767
Your application,
your technique,

40:29.833 --> 40:31.967
is the part where you gotta go
get up with other people

40:32.600 --> 40:33.400
and work.

40:34.700 --> 40:37.767
Time to pack your machines
and go home.

40:37.833 --> 40:38.633
Bili.

40:41.267 --> 40:42.433
[Al] I made it this far,
this Is--

40:42.500 --> 40:43.667
You know, it's great.
I came a long way.

40:43.733 --> 40:44.900
Ten years ago,

40:44.967 --> 40:47.267
I would've never
thought this was possible.

40:47.333 --> 40:49.433
Somebody has to
go home every week.

40:49.500 --> 40:51.133
You know,
I got dealt that hand.

40:55.033 --> 40:56.933
[narrator] On the next episode
of Ink Master ...

40:57.000 --> 40:58.900
This week, we're testing
your technical precision.

40:58.967 --> 41:00.667
This is gonna suck.

41:00.733 --> 41:01.900
Mother[bleep].

41:01.967 --> 41:04.800
Shane's once again
using black and gray. Shocking.

41:04.867 --> 41:06.200
I'm so [bleep] bad-ass

41:06.267 --> 41:07.700
that even if
I reduce my quality,

41:07.767 --> 41:09.600
it's still better
than everybody else.

41:09.667 --> 41:11.933
Everybody wants, like, back
pieces and full sleeves,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.467
and all that [bleep] in six
hours, it's not possible.

41:14.533 --> 41:17.233
I do [bleep]
smokin' tattoos.

41:17.300 --> 41:19.033
If they send me home,
they can suck it.

41:19.100 --> 41:20.467
It's getting thinned out.

41:20.533 --> 41:21.433
The less people there are,

41:21.500 --> 41:22.900
the less leeway
there's gonna be.

41:22.967 --> 41:24.633
This is not
a good one out of you.
