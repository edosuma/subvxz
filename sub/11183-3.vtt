00:23.957 --> 00:25.994
What are you doin' aboard my chopper?

00:26.059 --> 00:28.061
I'm on my way to see my Father.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.268
I chose the field. I set the trap.

00:33.333 --> 00:36.507
There's no way they're gonna let
you just pack up and fly out.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.982
He's coming in with everything he's got!

00:46.079 --> 00:47.422
Tracking.

00:48.115 --> 00:49.219
2 hits.

00:49.283 --> 00:50.421
I'm losing rotor control.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.327
...never have come after me.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.957
But what I do not need is a trip to Mexico.

03:09.022 --> 03:12.834
This ain't Mexico. It's Acapulco, man!

03:12.926 --> 03:16.396
Aca-sun-and-the-sand-Pulco!

03:16.496 --> 03:19.739
Oh, come on, kid. Take
this shuttle job with me.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.108
We'll deliver the old bird

03:21.168 --> 03:23.307
and then make some customer happy,

03:23.370 --> 03:25.077
and then, Whoo-hoo!

03:25.138 --> 03:26.913
Some customer, Dom?

03:28.675 --> 03:32.316
This customer wouldn't happen to be,
Queeny May Shapiro, would it?

03:33.146 --> 03:37.219
Well, yeah, yeah. Look…

03:37.417 --> 03:41.024
But, well, this is strictly business,
strictly business, String.

03:41.588 --> 03:44.432
And, besides, Queeny knows just
about everybody down there

03:44.491 --> 03:47.995
and she was, sort of hopin' that
she could introduce you to a…

03:48.061 --> 03:49.563
A certain gorgeous…

03:49.629 --> 03:53.372
What in the hell is Queeny gonna
do with an antique chopper?

03:54.201 --> 03:55.305
House calls.

03:55.502 --> 03:56.640
House calls?

03:56.937 --> 03:57.938
House calls.

03:59.539 --> 04:00.643
Here.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.085
The shutter ring was offset.

04:03.677 --> 04:04.883
It'll work just fine now.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.858
Take a picture of Queeny's little
girlfriend for me, will you?

04:07.914 --> 04:09.291
I'd like to see what I'm missin'.

04:09.349 --> 04:11.158
You're missin' a whole lot, String.

04:11.218 --> 04:13.824
A… and I'm not talking
about Queeny's friend either.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.992
Look, you can't spend your whole life

04:16.123 --> 04:18.262
sitting up there in the cabin with Tet.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.099
I know it.

04:23.163 --> 04:25.165
Well, then come with me.

04:28.368 --> 04:30.177
Maybe next time, Dom.

04:38.478 --> 04:41.652
There may not be a next time,
you ever think of that?

04:45.852 --> 04:47.263
I'll send you a postcard.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.697
I'm gonna miss you.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.858
Van Nuys 4 Tango Alpha.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.903
4 Tango Alpha at Santini Air.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.942
Requesting clearance for departure.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.670
4 Tango Alpha.

05:32.732 --> 05:34.234
Departure approved.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.247
4 Tango Alpha, thanks.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.422
The bird's on its way, and set for a tailspin.

05:49.716 --> 05:52.162
A very delicate job, if I may say.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.426
Very well. Thank you. Good night.

05:56.590 --> 06:00.834
Project 58205. Just some clerical
details that will need my attention.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.874
Wait until you move into my job, Mitchell

06:02.929 --> 06:06.934
and see how the details begin
to breed all around you.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.106
It'll be some time before I
move into your job, sir.

06:10.537 --> 06:13.347
All things being equal, that's probably true.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.951
But let's not waste time with maudlin musings

06:16.009 --> 06:18.353
on the inevitability of decline.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.019
Laura, the champagne, please.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.255
Good luck in Mexico, Mitch.

06:26.486 --> 06:28.864
And may you avoid the drudgery of details

06:28.922 --> 06:30.560
for at least a few years more.

06:30.624 --> 06:31.625
Salud.

06:48.475 --> 06:50.955
Bruck, see you in 10 days.

06:59.319 --> 07:02.198
Do you really believe
he'll replace you someday?

07:02.856 --> 07:06.030
He could. But why speculate
when we have the answer?

07:10.897 --> 07:14.344
The bird's on its way, and set for a tailspin.

07:14.601 --> 07:17.013
A very delicate job, if I may say.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.947
Very well. Thank you. Good night.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.814
Doesn't sound like clerical details, does it?

07:22.876 --> 07:23.946
No, sir.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.754
The call originated at a payphone,

07:30.050 --> 07:31.825
the 213 area.

07:31.918 --> 07:35.764
Specifically, Van Nuys Airport.

07:35.822 --> 07:38.462
We've nothing active in Southern
California at the moment.

07:38.525 --> 07:41.563
Van Nuys is the home field for Santini Air.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.670
You think it has something to
do with Stringfellow Hawke?

07:44.731 --> 07:47.405
I'd bet on it. Try to reach Santini.

07:49.502 --> 07:51.641
Take me back to the airport.

07:51.705 --> 07:54.117
I want the company jet
brought online immediately.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.950
Have a helicopter standing by
at Norton Air Force Base.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.421
Let's see if we can beat Bruck

07:58.478 --> 08:00.981
to the land of salsa and sunshine.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.597
Port of entry, 17.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.999
This is helicopter 4 Tango Alpha

08:11.057 --> 08:13.196
crossing international border marker

08:13.760 --> 08:14.761
42 Delta Poppa.

08:14.828 --> 08:15.966
Roger.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.532
4 Tango Alpha, this is Port of Entry 17.

08:18.598 --> 08:20.509
Flight plan to Acapulco, clear.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.069
Roger, Port of Entry.

08:25.071 --> 08:26.072
Hey!

08:26.673 --> 08:28.516
Terrific, man!

08:28.575 --> 08:30.054
What're you tryin' to do? Kill me?

08:30.110 --> 08:31.680
What are you doin' aboard my chopper?

08:31.745 --> 08:34.953
I was gonna try and hijack
something to Acapulco,

08:35.015 --> 08:38.121
but then I heard that you were
going there, so I decided to just

08:38.183 --> 08:39.663
sort of be a stowaway.

08:39.719 --> 08:41.460
The name's Phoebe Danner.

08:41.921 --> 08:43.058
Unreal.

08:43.390 --> 08:45.165
You can say that again.

08:45.759 --> 08:46.897
Hey, listen, man,

08:46.960 --> 08:48.997
I would not have taken this stupid old chopper

08:49.062 --> 08:52.100
if I'd known that you had, like,
weird personal prejudices.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.769
Wait a minute. Hold it. Hold it.

08:53.833 --> 08:56.541
I ain't got no… no prejudices
except one, Miss Donner.

08:56.603 --> 08:58.207
And that is, I don't like freeloaders.

08:58.304 --> 09:00.443
Now, for the third and last time,

09:00.507 --> 09:03.579
what are you doin' aboard
this vintage aircraft?

09:03.643 --> 09:06.180
The name's Danner, Phoebe Danner.

09:06.413 --> 09:09.292
And if you gotta know, I'm on
my way to see my Father, and…

09:12.085 --> 09:13.996
Mayday! Mayday!

09:14.054 --> 09:16.364
This is helicopter 4 Tango Alpha.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.130
4 Tango Alpha.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.761
At approximate coordinates

09:19.826 --> 09:24.400
520-2-762

09:24.464 --> 09:26.341
Auto-rotating in.

09:28.935 --> 09:31.438
What's happened? A… are we
gonna… Are we gonna…

09:31.504 --> 09:32.778
Yeah, kid, we're gonna.

09:32.839 --> 09:34.045
I don't believe it.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.643
Believe it, kid! Believe it.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.483
Here comes good old Mother Earth.

09:44.651 --> 09:47.097
Here, bury that big mouth of yours in this.

09:47.153 --> 09:48.359
Who's got a big mouth?

09:48.421 --> 09:50.298
Put it in front of your face, damn it!

09:50.356 --> 09:51.528
And hold on!

09:52.425 --> 09:53.870
Come on, baby, come on.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.464
Keep your nose up, sweetheart.
Come on. Keep your nose up.

09:56.529 --> 09:58.770
Get your tail down, sweetheart.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.715
That's it. Hit it down.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.483
O-o-oh, hell!

10:50.016 --> 10:51.017
Hey!

10:51.718 --> 10:53.755
What are you, nuts or somethin'?

10:59.626 --> 11:01.469
With a head like this,

11:01.928 --> 11:03.805
I should've gotten drunk, at least.

11:10.737 --> 11:12.375
Holy mackerel!

11:12.505 --> 11:14.143
What is it? Let me look.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.847
No, no, no, no, no! Don't move.

11:16.910 --> 11:17.911
Don't move.

11:19.979 --> 11:20.980
Don't move.

11:24.384 --> 11:27.854
Look, you… you give me your legs.

11:28.154 --> 11:30.532
Give me your legs and m… move very easily.

11:30.590 --> 11:34.094
That's it. Don't… That's it. Easy does it.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.868
All right, give me your legs. Easy.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.299
Easy.

11:39.632 --> 11:41.509
That's it. All right.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.446
D… drop right out.

11:44.170 --> 11:45.808
That's it. That's it.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.524
It's a miracle.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.126
Dumb luck, if you ask me.

12:07.694 --> 12:11.141
The bird's on its way, and set for a tailspin.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.710
A very delicate job, if I may say.

12:13.766 --> 12:16.178
Very well. Thank you. Good night.

12:18.204 --> 12:20.514
Mitchell Bruck is my Executive Officer.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.019
He's hardworking, smart as they come.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.852
But for some time now I've
had circumstantial evidence

12:25.912 --> 12:27.789
he was attempting to undermine my position.

12:27.847 --> 12:31.351
To get the committee to, retire me early.

12:32.118 --> 12:35.122
I think he realized I was on to his game plan.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.257
It's politics.

12:37.323 --> 12:38.825
Facts of life, Mr. Hawke.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.401
Bruck knows his days are numbered at the Firm.

12:41.461 --> 12:42.872
If he can deliver Airwolf,

12:42.929 --> 12:45.432
it would be worth at least
an Undersecretary position

12:45.498 --> 12:47.535
in any of a dozen intelligence agencies.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.546
So, he sabotages Dom's helicopter

12:49.602 --> 12:51.639
and drops him in the Sonora Desert

12:51.704 --> 12:53.650
and waits for me and Airwolf to arrive?

12:53.706 --> 12:56.016
Dom's the bait. There's no doubt about that.

12:56.075 --> 13:00.182
And any air search will most likely
be held up or minimal, at best.

13:00.246 --> 13:03.887
Bruck's worked before with a Colonel
Arias in the Mexican Air Force.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.863
And he controls the area
where Santini went down.

13:08.421 --> 13:09.525
Where are you going?

13:09.656 --> 13:10.794
After Dom.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.493
Not in Airwolf.

13:13.192 --> 13:14.637
Then why'd you tell me all this?

13:14.694 --> 13:17.265
Sooner or later, the information
would've reached you.

13:17.330 --> 13:20.174
And I don't want Bruck getting his
Machiavellian hands on Airwolf.

13:20.233 --> 13:23.043
Then fly with me and make sure he doesn't.

13:26.906 --> 13:28.317
You serious?

13:29.709 --> 13:31.052
You are.

13:32.378 --> 13:34.688
All right, you got yourself a copilot.

13:34.847 --> 13:35.951
Engineer.

13:36.015 --> 13:37.085
Mr. Hawke.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.151
No.

13:39.285 --> 13:40.696
She is a top pilot.

13:40.753 --> 13:42.198
So was Gabrielle.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.097
I'm not Gabrielle.

13:47.927 --> 13:50.373
The man said no. The answer is no.

13:57.537 --> 14:01.178
Our concession to propriety, 2 search planes.

14:01.307 --> 14:04.652
4 hours since Dominic
Santini sent out his mayday.

14:04.711 --> 14:08.158
I sincerely hope, Colonel Arias,
that your efforts at rescue

14:08.214 --> 14:10.353
will not be considered
too little, too late.

14:10.416 --> 14:13.727
Mitchell, how can 2 search
planes be not enough,

14:13.986 --> 14:17.263
if they are the only planes
I have in working condition?

14:17.323 --> 14:18.996
You have a point, Colonel.

14:19.058 --> 14:21.095
The device was set. It went off.

14:21.594 --> 14:25.337
I presume your men are waiting
and ready for this Mr. Hawke?

14:25.865 --> 14:29.972
Readiness is only an accomplished
fact when the need for it is over.

14:30.470 --> 14:34.179
Hawke is not the kind of man one
can ever truly be ready for.

14:34.807 --> 14:38.277
Although we're as close
to that desired condition

14:38.344 --> 14:40.551
as can be hoped for.

14:44.450 --> 14:46.054
Maybe it's just a ruse.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.360
Trying to get away without our hassling him.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.594
Not his style. He'll be here.

14:51.124 --> 14:52.797
I'm not so sure.

14:54.093 --> 14:55.231
I am.

16:47.139 --> 16:48.277
My God!

16:50.843 --> 16:53.449
That seems to be everyone's reaction.

17:07.093 --> 17:08.628
Mind the store.

17:27.012 --> 17:28.320
Hang on.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.262
Do you have to fly this low?

17:32.318 --> 17:33.661
Better that than radar.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.637
Hawke, you made your point.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.673
I'd like to get there in one piece.

17:45.531 --> 17:48.307
Besides, if I'm reading this right,

17:48.367 --> 17:50.472
we'll be out of fuel before
we reach the border.

17:50.536 --> 17:53.346
Not if that tanker you ordered
is where it's supposed to be.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.714
It'll be there.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.814
You know, if you can order tankers in support…

17:57.877 --> 18:00.756
Why don't I throw all the
Firm's resources into the game

18:00.813 --> 18:03.316
and swarm in there with a platoon of agents?

18:03.382 --> 18:04.827
'Cause the committee would realize

18:04.884 --> 18:07.160
I let the situation develop too far.

18:07.219 --> 18:10.291
Maybe Bruck won't replace
me, but someone would.

18:10.623 --> 18:11.693
Politics.

18:40.052 --> 18:41.053
Hey!

18:42.722 --> 18:44.133
I didn't even know you were gone.

18:44.190 --> 18:45.191
Yep.

18:45.257 --> 18:46.861
Here, you pull this.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.200
Oh, yeah.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.446
Thanks a lot.

18:56.902 --> 19:00.543
What'd I tell you? The idea of
hopping all the way down there...

19:08.414 --> 19:09.654
Choppers!

19:12.251 --> 19:13.252
Oh, yeah.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.320
Hey!

19:14.754 --> 19:16.028
Over here!

19:18.658 --> 19:19.830
Here!

19:30.403 --> 19:33.213
Bravo, this is Alpha. Lock and load.

19:33.472 --> 19:36.112
Roger, Alpha. Lock and load.

19:40.746 --> 19:41.019
Hey!

19:47.119 --> 19:48.120
Hey!

19:48.187 --> 19:49.291
Over… Hey, hey.

19:52.058 --> 19:54.129
Kid, I got a funny feeling.

19:56.395 --> 19:57.931
What kind of feeling?

20:03.736 --> 20:05.010
That kind.

21:01.227 --> 21:02.865
Mr. Santini,

21:02.928 --> 21:05.738
you are our prisoner, but we do not want you

21:05.798 --> 21:09.405
or the passenger you have
mysteriously acquired.

21:09.468 --> 21:12.142
You are aware, I'm sure, what we do want.

21:12.204 --> 21:16.118
You will stay within the perimeter
outlined by my gunners.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.882
If you do not, you will be fired on.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.694
I have a marginal contact at 23 miles.

21:24.750 --> 21:29.426
Azimuth line 140. Grid 7. Moving very fast.

21:32.424 --> 21:34.370
Contact, 326 Northwest.

21:34.426 --> 21:36.337
A pair in the air, one on the ground.

21:36.395 --> 21:37.669
- Choppers?
- Choppers.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.732
And I'll lay 10-to-1 I killed myself

21:39.799 --> 21:41.972
getting the allocations to pay for them.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.775
No bet. Hang on.

21:50.776 --> 21:52.915
Ground Control, this is Alpha chopper.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.150
Oh, my God.

22:20.873 --> 22:23.979
They hit the tail rotor.
I'm losing rotor control.

22:25.411 --> 22:27.584
He should never have come after me.

22:30.282 --> 22:31.852
Disengage rotor systems.

22:31.917 --> 22:34.090
8-count on my mark for turbine ignition.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.291
You're crazy! We can't…

22:35.354 --> 22:39.268
Mark, 8… 7… 6… 5…

22:39.325 --> 22:41.805
Hawke, there's 45,000 pounds
of thrust in those turbines.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.863
What'll happen to the tail rotor…

22:43.929 --> 22:45.499
2… 1… ignition.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.266
On first contact, he was approximately here.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.166
Less than a minute later, he was here.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.535
He bounced across a ridgeline,
right into our lap.

23:15.594 --> 23:17.505
Then why is he still not in your lap?

23:17.563 --> 23:19.440
Because he has more guts than sense.

23:19.498 --> 23:22.536
Going to Mach 1 like that put him
into critical fuel consumption.

23:22.601 --> 23:24.672
And his tail rotor was hit by a rocket.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.239
He can't have gotten very far.

23:26.305 --> 23:28.148
We'll start searching at first light.

23:28.207 --> 23:31.450
We could search for a week,
and in country like this,

23:31.510 --> 23:33.547
we could miss him by 50 meters.

23:33.612 --> 23:35.785
And while we search, he could return.

23:35.848 --> 23:38.328
The ground forces would
never be able to hold him.

23:38.384 --> 23:42.161
No. I chose the field. I set the trap.

23:42.688 --> 23:44.361
Now I have to wait.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.704
When he comes back, I'll get him.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.864
Comes back?

23:49.328 --> 23:52.502
But, Bruck, what if he does not come back?

23:52.731 --> 23:55.439
I mean, by now he knows it's a trap.

23:55.501 --> 23:58.971
He also knows that I'm not wining
and dining his friend out there.

23:59.038 --> 24:02.042
And Santini's passenger, that
was a wrinkle I didn't expect

24:02.107 --> 24:05.020
but it's one which I believe might help us.

24:05.077 --> 24:06.385
If you couldn't take him today,

24:06.445 --> 24:08.982
what makes you think you can do it tomorrow?

24:09.048 --> 24:12.655
Because I didn't get a chance
today to use the Leech.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.188
Leech?

24:14.253 --> 24:18.030
Air-to-air missile, of the Sidewinder variety.

24:19.191 --> 24:21.228
It's called the Leech

24:21.293 --> 24:25.469
because instead of exploding
on impact, it attaches itself.

24:25.564 --> 24:27.009
Santa Madre!

24:27.166 --> 24:32.138
After attachment, it fires a shaped
head into the skin of the aircraft

24:32.204 --> 24:35.674
followed by auditory or
visual disrupting agents.

24:35.741 --> 24:39.917
Incredibly high-pitched
sound, or gas, or both.

24:41.947 --> 24:43.688
The gas is not lethal,

24:43.749 --> 24:46.229
with a 3-minute leeway before unconsciousness,

24:46.285 --> 24:47.923
giving Hawke enough time to decide

24:47.987 --> 24:51.901
between a crack-up and death
or an emergency landing.

24:52.424 --> 24:55.234
Where do you think this Hawke is now?

24:56.795 --> 24:59.366
Well, he'll need to repair the rotor.

24:59.798 --> 25:03.405
There are salt and mining camps

25:03.502 --> 25:05.573
scattered all through this area.

25:11.310 --> 25:12.584
I got to set it down.

25:12.644 --> 25:14.248
You don't know what's down there.

25:14.313 --> 25:16.088
I've got no choice.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.860
It doesn't look deserted.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.952
Where are all the people?

25:52.084 --> 25:53.688
Probably took off.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.691
Well, wouldn't you

25:55.754 --> 25:58.325
if something like us
dropped into your backyard?

25:58.390 --> 26:00.961
Probably think we're a UFO or something.

26:01.026 --> 26:02.767
Or something.

26:11.870 --> 26:13.543
That's just what we need.

26:13.672 --> 26:15.345
Let's get that rotor off.

26:23.115 --> 26:25.652
Good thing it was a little bomb,

26:25.984 --> 26:28.055
just enough to bring her down,

26:28.353 --> 26:31.800
but not enough damage to kill me. Us.

26:33.158 --> 26:36.935
I think I can patch her up… Ow!

26:37.463 --> 26:38.464
Dominic.

26:39.631 --> 26:41.770
You can't fix what you can't see.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.711
Yeah, you got a point there, kid.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.612
A very definite point.

26:45.671 --> 26:49.414
But I would like to leave these
premises at the first opportunity.

26:49.475 --> 26:51.011
Good luck.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.756
These creeps, whoever they are,

26:53.912 --> 26:56.358
seriously want you to stay here, correct?

26:56.582 --> 26:57.959
Correct.

26:58.016 --> 27:01.589
So, there's no way they're gonna
let you just pack up and fly out.

27:01.653 --> 27:03.155
You know what I mean?

27:03.222 --> 27:04.997
Yeah, I know what you mean.

27:07.726 --> 27:08.727
Dominic?

27:11.330 --> 27:13.401
Do you think these guys are gonna kill us?

27:13.465 --> 27:14.603
What?

27:14.666 --> 27:17.340
Are you kidding? Nah.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.754
Is this your folks?

27:30.048 --> 27:32.358
Mom died when I was like, 5.

27:34.219 --> 27:37.496
Dad was off at sea. A sailor.

27:38.290 --> 27:41.237
He'd been gone ever since before I was born.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.671
So, they put me in a foster home.

27:45.564 --> 27:47.601
Last year, I started looking for him.

27:48.534 --> 27:50.036
Running away.

28:08.554 --> 28:11.728
This is the dress that I'm
going to wear when I meet him.

28:12.925 --> 28:16.600
He'll be coming off the ship,
walking down the gangplank.

28:17.496 --> 28:20.102
I'll be waiting for him at the dock.

28:21.533 --> 28:25.276
He'll recognize me right away
because I look a lot like my mom.

28:28.974 --> 28:29.975
Hey,

28:30.709 --> 28:32.052
you know, it'll...

28:32.110 --> 28:33.919
Oh, yeah.

28:34.913 --> 28:36.017
Dominic?

28:36.081 --> 28:37.287
Yeah, Phoebe?

28:38.250 --> 28:40.252
Why is all this happening?

28:43.388 --> 28:48.269
Well, it… it all has to do with
a friend of mine named Hawke

28:48.627 --> 28:50.800
a… and that helicopter you saw.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.202
Y… you got a few minutes for a story?

28:54.199 --> 28:58.579
Well, I… I knew this guy, Hawke's
old man, you see, in World War II.

28:58.870 --> 29:00.816
And… well, we were friends...

29:19.858 --> 29:21.394
We got company.

29:25.631 --> 29:27.941
Do me a favor. Next time
that super-hearing of yours

29:28.000 --> 29:30.173
clues you in, don't say anything.

29:30.235 --> 29:32.374
Just let me be surprised.

29:32.504 --> 29:35.144
Yeah, if there is a next time.

29:40.445 --> 29:41.719
Buenas noches.

29:45.817 --> 29:48.195
Please, please stop. Both of you.

29:48.854 --> 29:51.596
Never speak Spanish to me again.

29:51.657 --> 29:53.728
Your Spanish is horrible.

29:54.459 --> 29:56.200
Yours is not as bad,

29:56.261 --> 29:59.868
but let us stick to English,
since along with dollars

29:59.931 --> 30:02.468
it's the closest we have
to anything in common.

30:02.534 --> 30:03.604
Dollars?

30:03.669 --> 30:04.807
That's what the man said.

30:05.570 --> 30:08.710
My name is Joachim Esteban Santos.

30:08.774 --> 30:10.651
This is my sister, Miriam.

30:10.709 --> 30:12.120
My compadres.

30:12.444 --> 30:16.187
We are miners, we… gather
salt out there in the flats.

30:16.982 --> 30:19.588
Our funds are very low, to say the least.

30:19.651 --> 30:22.029
And you are using our facilities.

30:22.187 --> 30:25.396
You frightened our burros,
our wives, and our children.

30:25.457 --> 30:28.802
The few chickens that we have will
probably never lay another egg,

30:28.860 --> 30:32.398
thanks to the arrival of that thing
out there on our front street.

30:32.464 --> 30:34.273
Well, Señorita, the next time I land here,

30:34.333 --> 30:36.210
I'll try and be a little more gentle.

30:38.603 --> 30:40.378
You think that you and your compadres

30:40.439 --> 30:43.079
might be able to help us
repair that thing out there

30:43.141 --> 30:45.587
that's responsible for the
destruction of your peace

30:45.610 --> 30:50.116
and the… the elimination
of eggs from your sister's diet?

30:50.182 --> 30:54.858
You are too close to the truth
to be truly funny, sir.

30:59.024 --> 31:01.197
But I like your sense of humor.

31:04.763 --> 31:07.107
We will help. But first…

31:07.199 --> 31:09.679
Of course, dollars.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.404
Dollars.

31:20.045 --> 31:22.525
We could take all your gold, you know.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.151
That's impossible.

31:24.216 --> 31:28.756
Especially among 2 men that…
share the same sense of humor.

31:44.202 --> 31:48.378
We get very little intellectual
stimulation up here in these hills.

31:50.509 --> 31:53.649
But there is something else
we could do for you, señor.

31:53.712 --> 31:55.248
Possible, no?

31:55.814 --> 31:56.849
Si.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.394
Es posibile.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.193
How long till dawn?

32:02.254 --> 32:05.701
One hour and 18 minutes. Not very much time.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.260
Oh, but now you've got us to help you.

32:08.326 --> 32:10.272
Tell us what we can do for you.

32:16.635 --> 32:17.773
Why do you live out here?

32:19.504 --> 32:20.915
Why do you live out here?

32:21.039 --> 32:22.484
Hey, why not?

32:22.874 --> 32:24.683
It is a nice enough place.

32:24.810 --> 32:26.619
We got our work here.

32:26.978 --> 32:30.255
Our wives to love. Our children to laugh.

32:31.716 --> 32:34.026
Do you have something like that?

32:42.594 --> 32:44.767
You are a lonely man.

32:45.063 --> 32:48.567
Oh, it's… it's your business.

32:48.633 --> 32:51.477
But my sister, she obviously
thinks you are attractive.

32:51.536 --> 32:55.678
We become friends? When we finish
here, w… why don't you stay a while?

32:58.710 --> 33:00.712
You get right to the point, don't you?

33:00.779 --> 33:03.760
Hey, life is too short not to, my friend.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.157
Did I embarrass you?

33:08.119 --> 33:09.120
No.

33:10.222 --> 33:12.259
Your sister is very nice.

33:12.757 --> 33:16.398
She's a pain in the burro,
but she is my sister.

33:16.461 --> 33:18.168
She is very nice, she is.

33:19.164 --> 33:20.404
Who?

33:22.067 --> 33:23.137
What?

33:23.368 --> 33:24.472
His sister.

33:25.971 --> 33:27.780
Yes, very nice.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.079
Is that ready yet?

33:31.810 --> 33:33.448
Yeah, just about.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.718
You know, we really
appreciate your helping us.

33:38.783 --> 33:39.853
I keep warm.

33:39.918 --> 33:40.919
What?

33:40.986 --> 33:42.932
Trying to keep warm.

33:42.988 --> 33:44.934
Oh, yes, I… I see.

33:45.991 --> 33:47.334
I doubt it.

33:47.492 --> 33:51.133
Well, then enlighten me.
W… why are you helping us?

33:51.763 --> 33:53.071
Well…

33:54.065 --> 33:55.908
Probably out of the goodness of his heart.

33:55.967 --> 33:58.470
Hey, don't forget the gold.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.540
Yeah, don't forget the gold.

34:03.909 --> 34:06.355
He flies, but what do you do?

34:06.411 --> 34:07.549
I pay…

34:08.679 --> 34:10.125
and pray.

34:10.181 --> 34:12.684
He does have a sense of humor after all.

35:55.286 --> 35:57.095
So much for engine repairs.

36:01.226 --> 36:02.364
How's it look?

36:02.761 --> 36:03.899
I bought it.

36:04.129 --> 36:06.302
And I'd like to know whether it's fixed or…

36:06.364 --> 36:08.503
it's fixed, it's fixed. I think.

36:08.566 --> 36:11.012
We're gonna have to start
it, first shot, though.

36:11.069 --> 36:14.312
Those guys out there are going
to turn us into Swiss cheese.

36:14.372 --> 36:15.942
No "us," kid.

36:16.007 --> 36:19.079
It's me that's taking this
bird up if Hawke comes back.

36:19.310 --> 36:22.814
Nothing's gonna get riddled
if you just do what I said.

36:41.599 --> 36:43.442
This is Bruck. You got anything?

36:43.902 --> 36:45.643
Nothing, Mr. Bruck.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.843
Okay, Richards, keep your eyes open.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.351
Yes, sir.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.353
He'll come.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.327
We're leaving a hell of a dust cloud.

37:00.385 --> 37:03.958
They've got radar. Means we got to stay low.

37:04.022 --> 37:05.831
What about the little girl we saw?

37:07.225 --> 37:09.796
I figure her only chance is with us anyway.

38:03.882 --> 38:06.294
He's coming in with everything he's got!

38:35.180 --> 38:36.591
Now, kid! Now!

39:07.312 --> 39:09.451
Behind us. They're coming the other way.

39:16.254 --> 39:17.756
Yee-haw!

39:22.293 --> 39:24.273
He's up. Dom's got her up.

39:24.329 --> 39:26.502
Yeah, looks like we got other company, too.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.972
Missiles on their way.

39:32.871 --> 39:35.078
Tracking. Heat-seeking missiles.

39:35.139 --> 39:36.709
4, no, 6.

39:36.774 --> 39:38.481
Disperse deflector-pod 6.

39:53.658 --> 39:56.400
We got hit, we're going down.

39:59.430 --> 40:00.431
2 hits.

40:02.333 --> 40:04.438
Purge the cockpit, go on internal oxygen.

40:06.471 --> 40:08.075
It won't purge.

41:47.872 --> 41:49.010
You okay?

41:49.140 --> 41:50.278
Yeah.

41:50.341 --> 41:53.220
Think you can fly that
wreck to the nearest field?

41:53.277 --> 41:55.223
You want to race?

41:55.279 --> 41:56.849
Only if you give me a head start.

41:56.914 --> 41:57.949
Done.

42:02.553 --> 42:04.055
Hey, Dom.

42:05.023 --> 42:07.401
Isn't she a little young for you?

42:38.589 --> 42:39.693
It's him!

42:39.757 --> 42:40.827
Yeah?

43:21.632 --> 43:22.633
Phoebe?

43:25.937 --> 43:26.938
Phoebe?

43:30.741 --> 43:32.243
What's wrong?

43:35.079 --> 43:36.558
I'm scared.

43:37.148 --> 43:39.355
Scared? Of what?

43:40.852 --> 43:41.990
Of him.

43:43.087 --> 43:44.862
What if he doesn't like me?

43:46.691 --> 43:48.568
I liked you, didn't I?

43:49.393 --> 43:50.895
Not at first.

43:51.162 --> 43:53.005
Oh, sure I did.

43:53.064 --> 43:55.772
I was just shook up a little, that's all.

43:56.701 --> 43:57.771
Sure.

43:57.835 --> 43:58.939
Sure.

44:01.205 --> 44:03.617
Look, I want to tell you something.

44:04.242 --> 44:08.657
I'll bet that he's more afraid of
meeting you than you are of meeting him.

44:09.413 --> 44:11.791
Why would he be afraid of meeting me?

44:11.949 --> 44:13.587
The same reason you have,

44:14.185 --> 44:16.392
he doesn't know if you're gonna like him.

45:50.248 --> 45:51.693
Thanks, Dominic.

45:53.684 --> 45:55.391
"Thanks, Dominic"?

45:55.486 --> 45:58.899
Does she know what it cost
the Firm to track him down?

45:59.757 --> 46:02.636
No, but I've got a feeling
I'm going to find out.

46:02.693 --> 46:05.071
You're damn right you are. Laura?

46:05.463 --> 46:07.943
Well, we started with a computer search

46:07.999 --> 46:11.412
of all Merchant Marine records
over the past 15 years.

46:11.602 --> 46:14.344
Computer time alone was over $50,000…
