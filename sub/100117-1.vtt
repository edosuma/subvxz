18:43.078 --> 18:44.166
Excuse me.

18:45.820 --> 18:46.777
FBI.

18:46.821 --> 18:48.866
How can I help you?

18:48.910 --> 18:51.173
We can handle the evac, so why
don't you grab Crowley Jr. here

18:51.217 --> 18:54.263
whatever he needs
for his spell?

18:54.307 --> 18:55.308
No.

18:55.351 --> 18:56.135
What?

18:57.353 --> 18:59.138
Dean, I can't. I-I --

19:00.356 --> 19:02.010
I can't even look at him.

19:05.492 --> 19:07.320
Um -- I...

19:10.671 --> 19:12.629
Well, I-I -- Benzene?

19:12.673 --> 19:16.329
The pipeline outside town.
It sprung a leak.

19:16.372 --> 19:17.982
W-What pipeline?

19:18.026 --> 19:20.550
Sheriff, listen. The longer
we stand here talking about it,

19:20.594 --> 19:22.204
the more people
are gonna get sick.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.640
Now, the EPA is on its way,

19:23.684 --> 19:26.687
but we need to clear
these people out ASAP.

19:28.341 --> 19:31.561
Well, I suppose we could move
folks up to the high school.

19:31.605 --> 19:33.128
Where is that?

19:33.172 --> 19:36.175
About five miles
up 281.

19:37.263 --> 19:38.307
Well, that's far enough.

19:38.351 --> 19:40.091
Great. Get these people
on the move.

19:40.135 --> 19:43.834
We'll go house-to-house.
Come on.

19:56.369 --> 19:57.326
Uh, what's that?

19:57.370 --> 19:58.675
Don't worry about it.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.111
Okay. Cool.

20:08.337 --> 20:11.253
So, people are, like,
crazy good-looking now, eh?

20:11.297 --> 20:12.646
What?

20:12.689 --> 20:14.430
I mean, the last time
I was on Earth,

20:14.474 --> 20:15.736
I mean, I was human.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.390
Ah, it was a while ago.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.305
I mean, but, you know,
we were all worshipping

20:19.348 --> 20:22.830
this giant rock that looked
like a huge penis, and...

20:22.873 --> 20:27.356
Anyway, folks back then,
they were, uh, ugly.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.576
You know?
Had a lot of humps.

20:29.619 --> 20:31.665
I mean, a lot.

20:37.540 --> 20:40.282
Look at 'em now.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.501
I mean, look at you.

20:41.544 --> 20:44.547
I mean, you're, uh,
you know, gorgeous.

20:44.591 --> 20:47.637
What? Okay.

20:47.681 --> 20:49.683
When are you gonna
get out of that body?

20:49.726 --> 20:51.467
Eh, when I find
another one.

20:51.511 --> 20:54.644
I mean, I would've jumped
at the cemetery, but all those

20:54.688 --> 20:58.213
meat suits were a little
too, uh, you know, wormy.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.608
Difficult to blend,
if you will.

21:01.651 --> 21:03.131
Yeah.

21:04.698 --> 21:06.830
So, uh...

21:06.874 --> 21:10.399
who was...he, anyway?

21:13.968 --> 21:16.927
He was our kid.
Kinda.

21:18.407 --> 21:20.279
Oh. Sorry.

21:21.541 --> 21:24.326
Alright. So, what do you need
for this spell?

21:24.370 --> 21:26.502
You know, nothing much.

21:26.546 --> 21:28.461
Big bag of salt.

21:28.504 --> 21:29.592
Easy.

21:29.636 --> 21:31.551
And a --
And a human heart.

21:38.384 --> 21:41.735
Alright. I go left.
You go right.

21:41.778 --> 21:43.302
See anybody,
get 'em out.

21:43.345 --> 21:46.348
See a ghost, hit it
with the rock salt.

21:55.618 --> 21:58.273
Hello?

22:04.410 --> 22:05.454
Hello?!

22:15.638 --> 22:17.118

23:42.682 --> 23:45.685

23:45.728 --> 23:47.208

Okay. Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

24:00.569 --> 24:02.484
I'm safe, okay?
Come on.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.312
-I gotcha. I gotcha.
-Come here.

24:04.355 --> 24:06.314
I gotcha. Here we go.
Just, uh...

24:06.357 --> 24:09.448
-There's your mom. Alright?
-Oh, God. Thank God.

24:11.972 --> 24:14.931
Dead.
They're all dead.

24:14.975 --> 24:16.280
I know. I know.
Shh. Just --

24:16.324 --> 24:18.152
I'm gonna get you
out of here, alright?

24:18.195 --> 24:19.501
Hey.

24:19.545 --> 24:22.417
You're gonna be okay,
alright?

24:22.461 --> 24:24.637
Everything's
gonna be fine.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.739
♪ Happy birthday to you

24:39.782 --> 24:44.047

Just head to the gym!
I'll be right behind you!

25:06.983 --> 25:08.724
Move those people!

25:08.768 --> 25:11.466
Travis, I told you, you
gotta get out of the chapel.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.859
Yeah. God.

25:12.902 --> 25:14.513
No. No.

25:14.556 --> 25:17.994
Rowena, we need your help,
so move your ass.

25:18.038 --> 25:21.389
What? No, I'm not --

25:21.432 --> 25:23.696
Move your exquisite ass, please.

25:23.739 --> 25:25.828
Alright? Great.

25:25.872 --> 25:27.526
Here's your salt.

25:29.049 --> 25:31.573
Is there a problem?

25:31.617 --> 25:33.575
What? Oh. No.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.838
I-I mean, uh...

25:35.882 --> 25:37.840
I'm a fan.
Excuse me?

25:37.884 --> 25:40.277
Yeah, I-I didn't want to say it
in front of the other guys,

25:40.321 --> 25:43.759
but when you were in Hell,
with Alastair, I, uh --

25:43.803 --> 25:45.413
I got a chance
to watch you work.

25:45.456 --> 25:47.981
And, I mean, the things
you did to those people,

25:48.024 --> 25:49.417
I mean, it wasn't torture.

25:49.460 --> 25:52.202
It was, um --
It was art.

25:54.074 --> 25:55.684
Yeah, but that was
a long time ago.

25:55.728 --> 25:57.556
Depends how
you look at it.

25:59.514 --> 26:01.298
So, with all this going on,
what's it like down there?

26:01.342 --> 26:03.039
-In Hell?
-Yeah.

26:03.910 --> 26:07.174
You ever seen an ant hill
when it's, like, set on fire?

26:08.610 --> 26:11.613
Okay, well, there we were,
minding our own business,

26:11.657 --> 26:14.660
you know, flaying people for
eternity, like you do, right?

26:14.703 --> 26:20.013
And then every door in Hell
just sprang open all at once.

26:20.056 --> 26:23.059
You know? Souls got out.
Sky cracked.

26:23.103 --> 26:25.192
And, uh, boom, ta-da,
you know?

26:25.235 --> 26:28.935
Wait. Every door?
Even the Cage?

26:28.978 --> 26:30.545
Yeah, even the Cage.

26:31.807 --> 26:33.069
And Michael?

26:33.113 --> 26:35.942
Well, last I heard,
he was just sittin' there.

26:35.985 --> 26:39.728
Yeah, but if he got out,
I mean -- Ugh.

26:39.772 --> 26:41.904
I mean...

26:41.948 --> 26:44.080
he wouldn't hold
a grudge, right?

26:51.653 --> 26:53.394
Stay still.

27:03.883 --> 27:05.624
H-How?

27:05.667 --> 27:07.669
I'm an angel.

27:10.237 --> 27:12.718
And the clown was...

27:13.893 --> 27:15.329
A ghost.

27:16.896 --> 27:17.940
And you're...?

27:17.984 --> 27:20.595
Just a guy.

27:24.555 --> 27:25.948
-Sam?
-Yeah, I'm good.

27:25.992 --> 27:27.950
Just --
Like, when I shot God --

27:27.994 --> 27:31.127
I'm sorry.
When you shot God?

27:31.171 --> 27:32.651
It's a long story.

27:32.694 --> 27:36.089
It's nothing. It's fine.
It's just...

27:36.132 --> 27:37.786
Cass: Sam.

27:38.874 --> 27:40.006
Let me see.

27:50.364 --> 27:51.887
Dean: Sammy, please.

27:56.979 --> 27:58.807
Did you fix it?

27:58.851 --> 28:01.462
No. I can't. There's --

28:01.505 --> 28:03.943
There's an energy
in that wound that's --

28:03.986 --> 28:05.248
I never felt that before.

28:05.292 --> 28:07.947
-Well, like I said, it's fine.
-Sam.

28:12.342 --> 28:15.432
-Sheriff?
-Hey, uh, Agent.

28:15.476 --> 28:17.347
I'm, uh -- I'm doing
a final sweep,

28:17.391 --> 28:19.872
but looks like
I got everybody.

28:19.915 --> 28:22.352
Okay. Great.
Just head to the school.

28:22.396 --> 28:24.746
I'll meet you there.Copy that.

28:27.401 --> 28:29.185
Alright. We got to go.

28:29.229 --> 28:31.100
We got to go.
Come on. Come on.

28:31.144 --> 28:33.799
It's okay. Come on.
It's okay.

28:38.804 --> 28:40.849
Ma'am?

28:45.114 --> 28:46.942
Ma'am?

28:50.816 --> 28:52.556
You okay?

29:12.751 --> 29:15.579
Bel: So...
about that heart.

29:15.623 --> 29:18.582
Working on it. I'm thinking
maybe we hit the morgue.

29:18.626 --> 29:22.064
Hmm. Fresh, it'd be --
it would be better.

29:35.730 --> 29:37.210
Bel: Hmm.

29:41.867 --> 29:44.783
Hm. Cool.

30:07.936 --> 30:10.765
Son of a bitch.

30:10.809 --> 30:13.986
Yeah. Yeah.
Poor guy.

30:17.337 --> 30:19.165
-Whoa!

30:19.208 --> 30:22.690
Ahh.
Well, got a heart.

30:32.656 --> 30:35.050
Baby, what -- what are
you doing? We got to go.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.890
We need to move. Now.

30:48.934 --> 30:51.893
I remember you.
You took me home.

30:57.986 --> 30:59.945
It's just one ghost.

31:02.034 --> 31:04.297
It's okay. Stay back.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.349
Just three.

31:14.481 --> 31:17.397
Oh, hey.
Look, okay?

31:17.440 --> 31:20.748
I barely even -- I barely
even know this guy, okay?

31:30.105 --> 31:32.325
You shot me.

31:36.111 --> 31:38.940
Hey, hey.
Bad ghost.

31:38.984 --> 31:40.072
Bad.

31:48.036 --> 31:49.951
No.

31:56.175 --> 31:57.916
Dean: Hey, Casper.

32:01.876 --> 32:05.097
Spell. Now.
Let's get the salt.

32:17.065 --> 32:18.980
Come on. Come...

32:27.206 --> 32:28.250
We good?

32:28.294 --> 32:29.948
We're good.

32:35.170 --> 32:36.867
Animi...

32:38.086 --> 32:40.001
...infernorum...

32:41.394 --> 32:44.092

32:45.615 --> 32:47.052
...defigo...

32:51.447 --> 32:54.146
...vos intra confinia.

33:08.334 --> 33:09.378
Come on.

33:25.090 --> 33:27.570
Hey. It's okay.

33:27.614 --> 33:30.051
Vinciamni!

33:40.018 --> 33:42.107
-You alright? Okay.
-Okay.

33:51.116 --> 33:53.205
Is that...?

33:53.248 --> 33:55.120
The spell.

33:56.338 --> 33:58.253
Alright.
Let's go. Let's go.

33:58.297 --> 34:00.342
Sam!

34:04.912 --> 34:06.348
Go. Get them across
the line, Cass.

34:06.392 --> 34:08.089
-Sam...
-Go!

34:08.133 --> 34:11.092
-Cass: Come on.
-Sam: Bring it.

34:17.925 --> 34:20.232
Cass: Sam!

34:27.282 --> 34:29.110
I got you.
I got you. Come here.

34:29.154 --> 34:30.329
I got you.

35:02.883 --> 35:04.102
Shut up.

35:05.320 --> 35:09.150
Come on. Let's go.

35:41.356 --> 35:42.662
So, what now?

35:43.402 --> 35:46.883
Okay. You two go inside.
We'll take care of the town.

35:46.927 --> 35:49.712
And maybe don't tell anybody
about the whole ghost thing.

35:49.756 --> 35:51.366
Or the angel thing.

35:51.410 --> 35:54.543
Yeah, that -- that might freak
them out.

35:54.587 --> 35:57.677
Uh, "might"?

36:01.420 --> 36:02.508
Thank you.

36:16.739 --> 36:18.611
I got 'em.

36:26.923 --> 36:29.752
Here. Watch your step.
Okay.

36:39.632 --> 36:41.155
You okay?

36:41.199 --> 36:42.461
Yes, but --

36:42.504 --> 36:44.680
Good.

36:46.073 --> 36:49.119
Wow! Awkward.

36:49.163 --> 36:51.948
Wanna talk
about it or...?

36:54.516 --> 36:56.257
Is that a no?

36:56.301 --> 36:57.824
That's a no.

37:05.658 --> 37:07.355
How are the locals?

37:07.399 --> 37:10.402
They're asking a lot of
questions about the evacuation.

37:10.445 --> 37:12.317
And, by the way, when this
"gas leak" thing gets out,

37:12.360 --> 37:16.364
we have one, maybe two days
before the real FBI shows up.

37:16.408 --> 37:18.279
And --
Yeah, no, I figured.

37:18.323 --> 37:19.715
So what do we do now?

37:19.759 --> 37:22.240
Right now
we get you fixed up.

37:22.283 --> 37:23.676
We what?

37:23.719 --> 37:25.286
Chuck got shot
andyou got shot, right?

37:25.330 --> 37:26.722
-I'm fine.
-No, no, no. Come on.

37:26.766 --> 37:29.072
We've been going nonstop.
Let me see it.

37:38.517 --> 37:40.040
There's no exit wound.

37:40.083 --> 37:40.910
I know.

37:40.954 --> 37:42.782
How bad does it hurt?

37:42.825 --> 37:45.175
A little, not much.

37:45.219 --> 37:47.090
Okay.

37:48.570 --> 37:51.921
Hey, do you remember
when we were little?

37:51.965 --> 37:54.315
What I would do
to distract you

37:54.359 --> 37:58.232
whenever I'd rip off a Band-Aid
or something like that?

37:59.929 --> 38:02.758
Yeah. You'd tell
some stupid joke.

38:02.802 --> 38:05.326
Yeah. Knock, knock.

38:07.459 --> 38:08.547
Come on.
Knock, knock.

38:12.072 --> 38:13.726
Who's --

38:13.769 --> 38:15.945
Still got it.

38:15.989 --> 38:17.512
Yeah.

38:19.166 --> 38:24.606
So, when Chuck -- God --
said "This is the End,"

38:24.650 --> 38:26.565
I guess this
is what he meant.

38:26.608 --> 38:29.350
Yeah, well.

38:29.394 --> 38:30.482
Screw him.

38:30.525 --> 38:33.963
He's been playing us
this entire time.

38:35.661 --> 38:38.577
Alright.

38:38.620 --> 38:40.361
No.

38:42.537 --> 38:44.191
Just when we thought
we had a choice.

38:44.234 --> 38:46.889
You know, whenever we thought
we had free will.

38:46.933 --> 38:49.414
We were just rats
in a maze.

38:49.457 --> 38:53.243
Sure, we could go left.
Sure, we could go right.

38:53.287 --> 38:55.420
But we were still
in the damn maze.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.727
Just makes you think,
if all of it --

38:58.771 --> 39:01.513
you know, everything
that we've done...

39:01.556 --> 39:03.732
What did it even mean?

39:04.690 --> 39:06.169
It meant a lot.

39:08.084 --> 39:10.173
We still saved people.

39:13.873 --> 39:16.092
Yeah, but what for?
You know?

39:16.136 --> 39:18.617
Just so he could throw another
End of the World at us

39:18.660 --> 39:20.662
and then sit back
and chug popcorn?

39:20.706 --> 39:24.536
Maybe. Yeah, maybe.

39:24.579 --> 39:25.624
But...

39:25.667 --> 39:27.452
now he's gone.

39:27.495 --> 39:28.714
You think?

39:28.757 --> 39:30.455
That's what he does.

39:30.498 --> 39:33.806
He gets bored and -- and --
and -- and pulls the ripcord.

39:33.849 --> 39:35.764
I mean, that's what he did
with Apocalypse World

39:35.808 --> 39:39.072
and -- and probably
with all of them.

39:39.115 --> 39:42.510
He moves on,
starts another story.

39:42.554 --> 39:45.252
But you know what?

39:45.295 --> 39:46.253
Good.

39:46.296 --> 39:49.343
'Cause if he bailed,
it's just us.

39:49.387 --> 39:53.608
For the first time.
It's just us.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.351
And about
three billion ghosts.

39:57.395 --> 40:00.180
Yeah, well, what's one more
Apocalypse, right?

40:04.184 --> 40:08.231
But, seriously,
if we win --

40:08.275 --> 40:12.497
Whenwe win this,
God's gone.

40:12.540 --> 40:15.978
Hm. There's no one
to screw with us.

40:16.022 --> 40:19.068
There's no more maze.
It's just us.

40:19.112 --> 40:20.940
And we're free.

40:22.811 --> 40:26.728
So you and me versus
every soul in Hell?

40:29.601 --> 40:32.430
I like those odds.

40:34.388 --> 40:36.956
Yeah, me too.

40:36.999 --> 40:41.917
Well, you know
what that means.

40:41.961 --> 40:44.442
We got work to do.
