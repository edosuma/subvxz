00:49.408 --> 00:50.673
<i>Money
is sizeable.</i>

00:50.675 --> 00:52.274
<i>It will destroy
the crime syndicate.</i>

00:52.276 --> 00:53.308
Oh, there!

00:53.310 --> 00:54.644
Perhaps I didn't make myself

00:54.646 --> 00:56.345
clear enough
at the board meeting last week.

00:57.449 --> 01:01.316
It was my father's company,
it is now my company.

01:01.318 --> 01:02.819
But the money will go
to Maha Jaya.

01:02.821 --> 01:03.986
We are done here.

01:05.289 --> 01:06.456
Hi, Tian Xiao Xian.

01:06.458 --> 01:08.323
I'm Madame Liang,
head of Embassy Security.

01:08.325 --> 01:10.060
The ambassador has asked me
to look after you.

01:12.229 --> 01:13.596
Call me Xiao Xian.

01:22.374 --> 01:23.673
<i>With the increasing</i>

01:23.675 --> 01:24.474
<i>economic impact</i>

01:24.476 --> 01:26.509
<i>of Chinese businesses
in Maha Jaya,</i>

01:26.511 --> 01:28.411
<i>crimes against
the local Chinese community</i>

01:28.413 --> 01:29.779
<i>have been on the rise.</i>

01:29.781 --> 01:31.481
<i>The Chinese embassy
has been working</i>

01:31.483 --> 01:32.482
<i>with the local
authorities</i>

01:32.484 --> 01:34.983
<i>to take special measures
to keep our countrymen safe.</i>

01:34.985 --> 01:36.586
<i>Now,
with the alleged involvement</i>

01:36.588 --> 01:38.688
<i>of a powerful
criminal organization,</i>

01:38.690 --> 01:41.424
<i>there is cause
for even greater concern.</i>

01:41.426 --> 01:43.292
Chinese heiress, Tian Xiao Xian,

01:43.294 --> 01:44.461
<i>has just arrived
in Maha Jaya</i>

01:44.463 --> 01:46.830
<i>with a plan
to take down the syndicate.</i>

03:11.416 --> 03:14.349
That thing won't work out here.

03:14.351 --> 03:17.987
Those guys, they're our GPS
and navigation system.

03:17.989 --> 03:19.489
That's why we brought 'em.

03:50.354 --> 03:52.524
Ah, there you are.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.661
Look at you, looking all dapper.

03:59.464 --> 04:01.265
Time to ruin your day.

04:03.969 --> 04:05.302
We're in business.

05:21.278 --> 05:22.346
Shh.

05:23.381 --> 05:24.614
Don't speak, love.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.214
Don't leave me.

06:04.221 --> 06:05.390
Hey!

06:35.352 --> 06:36.486
What did I tell you?

06:36.488 --> 06:38.821
Watch your six. Pay attention.

06:38.823 --> 06:40.825
You know
I can take care of myself.

07:22.100 --> 07:23.966
What are you doing?

07:23.968 --> 07:25.968
Let's go.

07:36.047 --> 07:36.981
Here, grab this.

07:57.468 --> 07:58.670
Do not move.

08:00.672 --> 08:02.538
Good morning.

08:02.540 --> 08:04.475
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

08:08.680 --> 08:10.379
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I do.

08:10.381 --> 08:12.215
There's a cost here.

08:12.217 --> 08:13.950
Think twice before you continue.

08:13.952 --> 08:16.020
If there's a cost,
put it on my credit card.

08:17.488 --> 08:20.456
So, you must be the big boss.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.325
Kinda tall to be a Burmese.

08:22.327 --> 08:23.392
I'm Indonesian.

08:23.394 --> 08:26.329
Oh, okay, my bad, Indonesian.

08:26.331 --> 08:27.530
And you to us?

08:27.532 --> 08:29.899
Maybe you and I
could make a deal?

08:37.275 --> 08:41.010
Colonel, we found him
at the north side of the camp.

08:41.011 --> 08:42.912
Let's take ol' white collar
with us.

08:42.914 --> 08:45.149
Pretty sure Collins
hasn't had his breakfast yet.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.252
Don't shoot!
We're with the Americans!

08:49.254 --> 08:51.287
We had an agreement
with the mercies!

09:04.202 --> 09:06.537
Hey, where's
the women and children?

09:22.987 --> 09:25.087
Hey.

09:25.089 --> 09:26.889
Leave that alone.

09:26.891 --> 09:29.058
He said leave that alone.

09:29.060 --> 09:30.662
So leave it alone.

09:33.731 --> 09:35.033
Get the thermite cutter.

09:37.802 --> 09:39.837
You're making the biggest
mistake of your life.

09:41.806 --> 09:44.340
The man is a major terrorist.

09:44.342 --> 09:46.678
You think my agency
is just gonna let this go?

10:03.594 --> 10:05.528
You better pray
he's still alive.

10:11.936 --> 10:12.837
Yeah.

10:29.887 --> 10:33.022
Don't think
you're gonna enjoy your freedom.

10:33.024 --> 10:35.526
You're gonna bring
a world of hurt onto yourselves.

10:51.809 --> 10:54.543
I told you you'd be beggin'
on your knees tonight.

10:54.545 --> 10:55.646
Go to hell.

10:56.981 --> 10:58.147
You first.

11:16.368 --> 11:17.268
Here you go.

11:18.703 --> 11:21.003
Spa treatment is over, Collins.

11:21.005 --> 11:23.139
Let's torch this place
and get out of here.

11:23.141 --> 11:24.206
No evidence.

11:24.208 --> 11:28.044
We burn this place
and everyone in it.

11:28.046 --> 11:30.782
Your clothes, mate.
You might need them.

11:31.716 --> 11:34.384
Maybe a shower. You stink.

13:13.351 --> 13:16.854
Forgive me
for what I have to do.

13:22.394 --> 13:23.362
I have no choice.

14:03.901 --> 14:06.869
Su Feng, Collins
has been extracted.

14:06.871 --> 14:08.003
I'm glad we could

14:08.005 --> 14:09.104
put aside our differences
on this.

14:09.106 --> 14:10.540
He's a loose cannon.

14:10.542 --> 14:13.342
I think it's a mistake,
but it's your play.

14:13.344 --> 14:14.777
We're square now.

14:14.779 --> 14:16.479
One more thing.

14:16.481 --> 14:17.782
Get me her itinerary.

14:33.731 --> 14:34.966
They are in the arena.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.769
It better be
the two men I'm looking for.

14:44.942 --> 14:46.110
Here you go.

15:39.964 --> 15:43.500
Five. Okay? Five hundred.

16:08.593 --> 16:09.561
Five.

16:20.104 --> 16:23.072
Payu! We're on! Let's go!

16:27.713 --> 16:28.812
Yeah!

16:31.248 --> 16:32.350
Let's beat him!

17:24.803 --> 17:26.069
- Hey, come on!
- Come on!

17:35.480 --> 17:37.314
Yeah!

18:09.481 --> 18:11.081
Hey! Huh?

18:12.484 --> 18:13.652
I want in.

18:15.487 --> 18:17.556
- I'll pay you.
- Okay.

18:33.337 --> 18:35.272
- Yeah!
- Bro.

18:45.784 --> 18:49.454
Place a bet more. Place more.

19:04.736 --> 19:05.802
Come on!

19:14.278 --> 19:17.314
Remember me? Huh?
I remember you.

19:18.617 --> 19:20.215
You killed my wife.

19:20.217 --> 19:22.752
For this, I will kill you.

20:09.734 --> 20:10.635
Shit!

20:43.034 --> 20:44.134
Come on!

20:56.313 --> 20:57.714
That's the guy from the camp.

20:57.716 --> 20:58.617
Yeah.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.318
Give me a hand.

21:16.034 --> 21:17.134
How is he?

21:18.670 --> 21:20.202
He's lost a lot of blood.

21:20.204 --> 21:21.640
He needs food.

21:22.974 --> 21:24.208
I made one for him.

21:26.243 --> 21:27.777
He was trying to kill me.

21:27.779 --> 21:29.313
I would do the same.

21:49.034 --> 21:50.200
We need to talk.

22:00.045 --> 22:02.514
I buried many of my friends
because of you two.

22:03.381 --> 22:04.847
It's not what you think.

22:04.849 --> 22:06.749
You were with the killers
that came into my camp.

22:06.751 --> 22:09.421
We were told we were
on a humanitarian mission,

22:10.422 --> 22:12.189
but we were lied to.

22:14.492 --> 22:16.628
Hey! What about the prisoners?

22:18.096 --> 22:20.596
Oh, yeah, yeah, um, Dom,

22:20.598 --> 22:22.699
reunite them with the prisoners.

22:28.473 --> 22:30.740
This place reminds me
of Boy Scout camp.

22:30.742 --> 22:32.375
In you go.

22:32.377 --> 22:33.845
A bunch of assholes there
as well.

22:37.281 --> 22:38.981
Five-minute fuse, Collins.

22:40.051 --> 22:41.419
Fuck it up, Mook.

22:52.764 --> 22:53.665
Come push me.

23:05.744 --> 23:07.810
Get out of here!

23:07.812 --> 23:10.413
Come, come, come.
Come on. It's about to explode.

23:10.415 --> 23:11.481
Go! Go!

23:11.483 --> 23:12.584
Go! Go!

23:13.451 --> 23:14.517
Come on!

23:14.519 --> 23:16.152
How long do we have?

23:16.154 --> 23:18.421
CL-21 explosive device.

23:18.423 --> 23:19.624
Less than one minute.

23:20.391 --> 23:22.257
I can't diffuse this.

23:22.259 --> 23:24.227
- Go, go, go!
- Go!

23:24.229 --> 23:26.229
Everybody out, out!

23:26.231 --> 23:27.398
- Go!
- No, you go!

23:46.618 --> 23:48.851
We didn't fire our weapons.

23:48.853 --> 23:50.653
We thought we were doing
something good.

23:50.655 --> 23:52.688
Yeah, no good there.

23:52.690 --> 23:56.359
We were double-crossed
and left for dead.

23:56.361 --> 23:57.896
We are after the same men.

23:59.497 --> 24:00.830
Who are they?

24:00.832 --> 24:02.400
Some kind of criminal gang.

24:02.967 --> 24:05.201
Really bad guys.

24:05.203 --> 24:08.004
What were you doing at a camp?

24:08.006 --> 24:10.439
My men and I
were paid to guard the place.

24:10.441 --> 24:11.507
It was just a job.

24:11.509 --> 24:13.109
We are soldiers for hire.

24:13.111 --> 24:14.744
Everyone uses us.

24:14.746 --> 24:15.680
So,

24:16.881 --> 24:18.313
what's your plan?

24:18.315 --> 24:21.551
Make money, finance, resupply.

24:21.553 --> 24:23.853
And then, it's payback.

24:23.855 --> 24:25.490
Yeah.

24:29.227 --> 24:30.461
Not much of a plan.

24:31.396 --> 24:32.864
You have a better idea?

24:35.667 --> 24:38.801
Perhaps, we can work together.

24:38.803 --> 24:41.871
I have a lot of contacts.
I can find anyone.

24:41.873 --> 24:42.907
But first...

24:45.243 --> 24:46.845
a toast.

24:55.153 --> 24:56.152
To new friends.

24:56.154 --> 24:58.054
- To new friends.
- To new friends.

24:58.056 --> 24:58.990
Yeah.

25:06.164 --> 25:08.130
One more, don't be shy.

25:08.132 --> 25:09.599
Yup.

25:09.601 --> 25:12.103
Yeah.

25:19.944 --> 25:21.813
My father loved it here.

25:25.316 --> 25:27.016
How is the ambassador?

25:27.018 --> 25:28.851
He was a good friend
of my father.

25:28.853 --> 25:30.119
He's doing well.

25:30.121 --> 25:31.823
He speaks highly of your father.

25:35.693 --> 25:38.761
We'll arrive
for your interview in an hour.

25:38.763 --> 25:40.496
I just want to say
how much I admire the work

25:40.498 --> 25:41.931
you've been doing here
for the past week.

25:41.933 --> 25:43.367
Thanks.
I'm not sure I deserve it.

25:43.369 --> 25:46.335
Well, I think you do.
And so do a lot of others.

25:46.337 --> 25:47.603
Thank you.
It's good to hear that.

25:47.605 --> 25:48.940
Sometimes I feel like
I'm walking alone.

26:00.118 --> 26:01.019
What?

26:06.124 --> 26:07.423
He's gone.

26:07.425 --> 26:09.792
I didn't hear him leave.

26:09.794 --> 26:12.028
I guess
he did not like my cooking.

26:12.030 --> 26:14.063
- Yeah, well...
- Yeah.

26:14.065 --> 26:15.197
There is that.

26:33.184 --> 26:34.384
I think we've been set up.

26:34.386 --> 26:35.486
What?

26:36.955 --> 26:40.191
Freeze! Put your hands
above your head. Don't move!

26:41.659 --> 26:43.628
- Handcuffs! Bring them out!
- Okay, officer.

27:03.147 --> 27:04.182
Oh, man.

27:25.670 --> 27:26.702
Yes?

27:26.704 --> 27:28.504
This is a message for Collins.

27:28.506 --> 27:29.839
<i>Collins?</i>

27:29.841 --> 27:31.140
No one here by that name.

27:31.142 --> 27:33.578
Trust me,
he'll wanna know.

27:36.382 --> 27:39.582
You have a message for Collins,
you can talk to me.

27:39.584 --> 27:40.349
<i>Tell him</i>

27:40.351 --> 27:41.517
<i>that the two chaps
from the jungle raid</i>

27:41.519 --> 27:43.721
<i>are in custody
at Central Police Station.</i>

28:00.506 --> 28:02.439
You take me
to the nicest places.

28:05.777 --> 28:07.712
Are you being sent
back to China?

28:09.280 --> 28:11.814
The gang
took everything from us.

28:11.816 --> 28:13.684
I didn't want it to be this way.

28:28.633 --> 28:29.767
Pa?

28:33.472 --> 28:35.573
I want to go home.

28:38.009 --> 28:39.277
<i>I want to go home.</i>

28:57.762 --> 29:00.062
Miss Tian,
we're so pleased to have you.

29:00.064 --> 29:01.330
We'd like to lead
into the interview

29:01.332 --> 29:02.898
with some background
about your father,

29:02.900 --> 29:04.233
your inheritance.

29:04.235 --> 29:05.267
Would that be all right?

29:05.269 --> 29:06.702
Let's try to keep
the personal questions

29:06.704 --> 29:07.770
to a minimum.

29:07.772 --> 29:09.071
I'm here for the charity.

29:09.073 --> 29:10.942
- Okay, sure, understand.
- Great.

29:17.516 --> 29:19.516
<i>The two guides
you used in the jungle</i>

29:19.518 --> 29:21.384
<i>are down at the Central
Police Station.</i>

29:21.386 --> 29:24.222
Central Police Station? Really?

29:26.357 --> 29:28.357
Well, that is very interesting.

29:28.359 --> 29:31.160
I suggest you take care
of this immediately.

29:31.162 --> 29:32.096
Understood.

29:34.098 --> 29:35.698
Those two little jungle rats

29:35.700 --> 29:37.633
who shouldn't have survived
that explosion.

29:37.635 --> 29:38.734
That's not possible.

29:38.736 --> 29:40.703
We piled enough composition four
in those cages

29:40.705 --> 29:41.971
to kill everything
in the vicinity.

29:41.973 --> 29:43.873
Well, two resilient inmates
at Central

29:43.875 --> 29:45.109
would disagree with you.

29:45.977 --> 29:48.043
Let's stay focused in on point.

29:48.045 --> 29:49.914
We'll deal with those mavericks
as and when.

29:53.951 --> 29:56.051
Crimes against
the local Chinese community.

29:56.053 --> 29:57.720
<i>Have been on the rise.</i>

29:57.722 --> 29:59.221
Chinese heiress, Tian Xiao Xian,

29:59.223 --> 30:01.724
<i>will join Damon live
in the studio today</i>

30:01.726 --> 30:02.925
<i>to talk about her plans</i>

30:02.927 --> 30:05.495
<i>to push back
against the syndicate.</i>

30:05.497 --> 30:06.962
<i>You know her
as the daughter</i>

30:06.964 --> 30:08.565
<i>of Chinese real
estate mogul,</i>

30:08.567 --> 30:11.066
Tian Wai Gow.

30:11.068 --> 30:14.371
She's the heiress who set aside
her pampered life,

30:14.373 --> 30:16.872
and shared her wealth
with those in need.

30:16.874 --> 30:20.743
Since her father's passing,
she has devoted herself

30:20.745 --> 30:23.179
and her family's fortune
to philanthropy,

30:23.181 --> 30:27.016
crime prevention,
and corruption in our city.

30:27.018 --> 30:30.352
It's my distinct pleasure
to welcome Miss Xiao Xian.

30:30.354 --> 30:31.289
Thank you, Damon.

30:32.156 --> 30:33.989
You were born to wealth.

30:33.991 --> 30:36.928
You've never had to work
unless you decided to do so.

30:38.329 --> 30:39.462
So, why?

30:39.464 --> 30:43.799
Why take such a risk
in such a dangerous cause?

30:43.801 --> 30:45.868
My father grew up here.

30:45.870 --> 30:49.606
And Maha Jaya
is a very special place to him.

30:49.608 --> 30:52.341
<i>Children don't have
the luxury of playing outside,</i>

30:52.343 --> 30:54.611
<i>because it's
simply not safe.</i>

30:54.613 --> 30:57.346
<i>The investment allows us
to build the infrastructure,</i>

30:57.348 --> 30:59.181
<i>so that the people
of this country</i>

30:59.183 --> 31:01.518
can have access to an education,

31:01.520 --> 31:04.088
<i>creating real jobs
and, in turn, an economy.</i>

31:05.524 --> 31:08.357
My father told me
that the greatest wealth

31:08.359 --> 31:11.695
is being able to live a life
of service to others.

31:11.697 --> 31:15.398
<i>I want nothing more
than to give these people</i>

31:15.400 --> 31:17.967
<i>the same chance
that I was given,</i>

31:17.969 --> 31:21.471
<i>so they can experience
the joy of family,</i>

31:21.473 --> 31:25.444
<i>love, and a safe place
to call home.</i>

31:26.578 --> 31:28.811
These crime syndicates must go.

31:28.813 --> 31:31.747
The people, the children,
are the future of this country.

31:32.984 --> 31:35.086
<i>When I see them,
I see...</i>

31:36.020 --> 31:39.524
resilience, hope, and strength.

31:41.859 --> 31:43.460
We look forward to that.

31:43.462 --> 31:46.829
<i>The donation you're making
is very sizeable.</i>

31:46.831 --> 31:50.268
<i>It is not a donation. It is
an investment in humanity.</i>

31:51.370 --> 31:52.835
The money allows them

31:52.837 --> 31:53.737
to have options,

31:53.739 --> 31:56.105
so that they can get
on the right side of the law.

31:56.107 --> 31:58.642
So that crime syndicates
don't have a grip

31:58.644 --> 32:00.111
on these people through fear.

32:04.048 --> 32:06.416
All right,
she's leaving the hotel.

32:06.418 --> 32:07.386
Ten-four.

32:08.019 --> 32:09.386
Moving forward.

32:09.388 --> 32:11.287
What kind of security
are we talking?

32:11.289 --> 32:12.187
Rent-a-cops.

32:12.189 --> 32:14.089
They'll scatter as soon
as we turn up the heat.

32:14.091 --> 32:15.692
We are in business.

32:18.630 --> 32:19.864
Let's do it.

32:25.537 --> 32:26.469
Thank you, Xiao Xian.

32:26.471 --> 32:29.106
It has been an honor
to speak with you today.

32:32.877 --> 32:34.045
Thank you so much.

32:56.033 --> 32:58.169
Go! Go! Move! Move!

33:06.378 --> 33:07.910
Hide behind me.

33:31.035 --> 33:32.303
Don't mind me.

33:40.479 --> 33:42.044
Run to the police station.

33:42.046 --> 33:43.112
They'll get you to the embassy.

33:43.114 --> 33:44.614
What about you?

33:44.616 --> 33:46.350
Don't mind me. Three, two, one.

33:57.396 --> 33:58.728
Joey, get in the van.

33:58.730 --> 34:00.129
<i>Devereaux,
move to market.</i>

34:00.131 --> 34:01.598
<i>Dom, you go south.</i>

34:01.600 --> 34:03.232
<i>Steiner, you're
with me, now!</i>

34:10.442 --> 34:12.274
Can you please help me?
Please! Please!

34:12.275 --> 34:13.443
Police station! Please!

34:13.445 --> 34:15.043
- Take me to the police station!
- Okay.

34:15.045 --> 34:16.145
Right away!

34:23.987 --> 34:24.920
Stop!

34:24.922 --> 34:26.690
- What are you doing?
- Stop!

34:33.164 --> 34:36.033
...son of a bitch!

34:45.444 --> 34:47.311
Come on! Get in!
Let's go!

34:50.246 --> 34:52.449
Dominique's dead.
He was out of control.

34:52.451 --> 34:54.884
She's gone.
Fucked off in a tuk-tuk.

34:54.886 --> 34:57.921
The intel was wrong.
You almost got us killed.

34:57.923 --> 34:59.354
Deal with it, Devereaux.

34:59.356 --> 35:01.056
We get paid
to almost get killed.

35:01.058 --> 35:02.759
Key word. "Almost."

35:02.761 --> 35:03.726
Quit your moanin'.

35:03.728 --> 35:04.960
There's another loose end

35:04.962 --> 35:05.862
we need to deal with.

35:05.864 --> 35:07.831
Who's more important
than killing the girl?

35:07.833 --> 35:11.133
Your two zombie trackers
back from the dead, that's who.

35:11.135 --> 35:12.702
They can ID
every single one of us.

35:12.704 --> 35:14.069
They need to be silenced.

35:14.071 --> 35:15.672
You wanna hit
the police station?

35:15.674 --> 35:17.139
Yes, a police station,

35:17.141 --> 35:19.107
not a castle
with a fuckin' moat.

35:19.109 --> 35:21.009
Those cops
are on cruise control.

35:21.011 --> 35:22.311
They won't be expecting us.

35:22.313 --> 35:24.248
I'm surprised
if they're even awake.

35:33.492 --> 35:36.058
Please! Help me! Please!

35:36.060 --> 35:38.597
Please! Help me! Please!

35:39.731 --> 35:41.196
They've been trying to kill me.

35:41.198 --> 35:42.297
I...

35:42.299 --> 35:44.032
I was just in a shootout.

35:44.034 --> 35:45.200
Do you understand?

35:45.202 --> 35:46.335
Do you...

35:46.337 --> 35:48.938
Do you speak English? Chinese?

35:48.940 --> 35:50.874
Look at this! That's me!

35:50.876 --> 35:52.542
See? That's me.

35:52.544 --> 35:54.444
- Yes. That's me.
- She's on TV.

35:54.446 --> 35:57.012
Come in! Here.

35:57.014 --> 35:59.014
Sit down!

35:59.016 --> 36:00.385
Take it easy, officer.

36:07.926 --> 36:09.191
You are involved

36:09.193 --> 36:11.195
in illegal fighting
and gambling.

36:12.263 --> 36:16.098
Are you asking me or telling me?

36:20.505 --> 36:22.405
Don't lock it up yet.

36:22.407 --> 36:23.307
Move.

36:27.746 --> 36:28.647
Chinese?

36:35.252 --> 36:36.653
I would say we have five

36:36.655 --> 36:37.554
to ten minutes max.

36:37.556 --> 36:39.756
Go in and out quick,
shock and awe, baby.

36:39.758 --> 36:42.157
Devereaux, you're on the wheel.
Joey, you're with us.

36:42.159 --> 36:43.260
Let's go.

36:48.900 --> 36:49.801
Let's go.

37:01.513 --> 37:04.212
Hey, you're the one on TV?

37:04.214 --> 37:05.815
You're Chinese? Great!

37:05.817 --> 37:07.984
Ask her
what happened at the hotel.

37:07.986 --> 37:10.755
Tell him
someone is trying to kill me.

37:15.760 --> 37:20.663
You think you're better than us?

37:20.665 --> 37:24.335
Because you are
an ex-soldier?

37:27.072 --> 37:29.639
You're nothing
but a pussy to me.

37:29.641 --> 37:30.707
How about this?

37:30.709 --> 37:32.809
If you don't talk,
you go to prison!

37:35.614 --> 37:38.146
Stay low
and away from the windows!

37:38.148 --> 37:39.214
Let's move.

37:39.216 --> 37:40.650
See what's happening.

37:47.826 --> 37:48.725
Go, quickly!

37:48.727 --> 37:50.495
We have to bring chief
out of here.

37:51.863 --> 37:52.729
Guard him!

37:52.731 --> 37:54.229
- Don't let him go anywhere!
- Yes, sir!

38:06.811 --> 38:08.413
They're coming!

38:09.279 --> 38:11.481
Can you get me out of here?

38:11.483 --> 38:12.917
I don't know how.

38:36.206 --> 38:38.975
Officer, please let me go!

38:40.412 --> 38:41.913
Let's sort this out, officer.

38:50.155 --> 38:51.219
Stop!

38:57.696 --> 38:58.596
Long-Fei!

38:59.798 --> 39:00.699
Stay here!

39:04.636 --> 39:05.537
Shit.

39:07.572 --> 39:09.337
We need to find another way out.

39:11.341 --> 39:12.875
Get up! On your feet!

39:14.512 --> 39:15.714
Where do they keep
the prisoners?

39:16.848 --> 39:18.181
Where are the prisoners?

39:18.183 --> 39:19.281
They aren't here!

39:19.283 --> 39:21.117
All prisoners
are locked up downstairs.

39:21.119 --> 39:23.152
Prisoners
are downstairs in holding.

39:23.154 --> 39:24.821
Mook!
Break out the door!

39:27.257 --> 39:28.991
<i>Check
every single hallway.</i>

39:28.993 --> 39:30.860
<i>Mook, I need you upstairs
with me.</i>

39:30.862 --> 39:31.996
I'm on my way, Collins.

39:41.305 --> 39:43.573
Just who I was looking for.

39:43.575 --> 39:45.408
The girl had nothing to do
with this.

39:45.410 --> 39:46.909
She's everything to do
with this.

39:46.911 --> 39:47.910
What?

39:47.912 --> 39:49.378
What are you talking about?

39:49.380 --> 39:51.681
This is my lucky day.

39:55.153 --> 39:56.387
Get out of here!

40:43.635 --> 40:45.067
Huh?

41:04.222 --> 41:05.890
You. You set this up.

41:07.525 --> 41:08.927
I did it to flush them out.

41:10.327 --> 41:11.394
You should go.

41:11.396 --> 41:12.728
Leave with your friend.

41:16.134 --> 41:17.035
Go.

41:34.485 --> 41:35.518
Move! Quickly!

42:24.370 --> 42:25.470
Don't do it.

42:48.192 --> 42:49.427
Well, well, well.

42:51.095 --> 42:52.962
What a nice surprise.

42:52.964 --> 42:53.865
Joey!

43:07.545 --> 43:08.978
Go!

43:08.980 --> 43:10.179
Take the girl!

43:10.181 --> 43:11.082
Get out of here!

43:12.183 --> 43:13.084
Go!

43:14.819 --> 43:16.187
Gotta go now! Go!

43:16.888 --> 43:17.954
Come on!

43:17.956 --> 43:19.021
Come on.

43:23.962 --> 43:25.027
Go!

44:15.580 --> 44:16.681
Shit.

44:29.927 --> 44:32.094
Everybody fall back.

44:32.096 --> 44:34.663
Big man, meet me
at the south side alley way.

44:34.665 --> 44:35.967
Huh?

44:42.374 --> 44:43.440
Get in!

44:43.442 --> 44:44.607
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

44:50.915 --> 44:53.249
- Move it!
- All right!

44:53.251 --> 44:54.750
Oh! Please!

44:54.752 --> 44:57.219
Keep moving. Keep moving.
Go! Keep moving.

44:57.221 --> 44:59.590
I said the south side.
Where are ya?

45:04.595 --> 45:06.264
Go!

45:10.668 --> 45:11.834
Mook! Where's Mook?

45:11.836 --> 45:14.203
- She's fuckin' dead, all right?
- Shit.

45:14.205 --> 45:15.771
- And Steiner?
- Steiner, too.

45:15.773 --> 45:17.573
This is turning
into a real shit show.

45:17.575 --> 45:19.208
This is
an expensive fuckin' exercise.

45:19.210 --> 45:21.877
Who are these fuckin'
bush babies you hired anyway?

45:21.879 --> 45:24.313
Just local trackers
from one of the villages.

45:24.315 --> 45:26.383
From like a village
of fuckin' ninja warrior land?

45:26.385 --> 45:27.417
Jesus Christ!

45:27.419 --> 45:29.654
They have to be down
one of these streets.

45:32.356 --> 45:34.058
There they are!

45:37.328 --> 45:38.229
Guys.

45:39.964 --> 45:41.897
Moving! Moving! Move!

45:41.899 --> 45:43.134
- Huh?
- Wait, what?

45:56.647 --> 45:57.815
Come on!

45:59.183 --> 46:00.450
There they fucking are!

46:00.452 --> 46:01.684
In here! Move!

46:01.686 --> 46:02.920
Get out of the way!

46:08.226 --> 46:09.291
Fuckin' move!

46:09.293 --> 46:10.194
Down here!

46:16.100 --> 46:17.434
Whoa!

46:17.436 --> 46:19.469
Fuckin' hell! Jesus!

46:22.006 --> 46:23.540
Whoa!

46:23.542 --> 46:25.276
Shut the fuck up! Fuck off!

46:29.548 --> 46:30.681
They're gone!

46:32.283 --> 46:34.884
Fuck!

46:34.886 --> 46:36.986
Now you get the van,
get to Devereaux.

46:36.988 --> 46:37.887
No way.

46:37.889 --> 46:38.954
You meet me
at the marketplace there.

46:38.956 --> 46:40.356
No, you do as your fuckin' told
and get in the van.

46:40.358 --> 46:41.991
Who do you think
you're talking to, eh?

46:41.993 --> 46:44.059
You keep telling me what to do,
and you're pissing me off.

46:44.061 --> 46:46.262
We're running around the streets
with fuckin' machine guns.

46:46.264 --> 46:47.163
Look at the eyes on us!

46:47.165 --> 46:48.964
How long is it gonna be
before the police turn up?

46:48.966 --> 46:50.266
You take that,
you get to the van,

46:50.268 --> 46:51.836
and you do
as you're fucking told!

47:01.145 --> 47:02.379
Sir.

47:02.381 --> 47:06.148
Oh. Lee,
you've arrived just in time.

47:06.150 --> 47:09.084
These are signed.

47:09.086 --> 47:10.186
You can send them out.

47:10.188 --> 47:15.126
Of course, but I have
something urgent to report.

47:15.661 --> 47:16.560
What?

47:16.562 --> 47:21.897
There has been an attack
on the Nagavara Hotel.

47:21.899 --> 47:24.300
Are Liang and Xiao Xian safe?

47:24.302 --> 47:26.735
Liang is injured.
She's in the hospital.

47:26.737 --> 47:29.439
Xiao Xian is missing.

47:29.441 --> 47:30.674
Missing?

47:30.676 --> 47:32.841
Liang believes Xiao Xian
must have run

47:32.843 --> 47:34.210
to the Chinese Embassy.

47:34.212 --> 47:38.749
But so far,
we haven't heard from her.

47:40.151 --> 47:43.921
Get me
the Maha Jaya Chief of Police.

47:55.866 --> 47:56.932
Yeah?

47:56.934 --> 47:58.702
You messed up
the contract, Collins.

47:58.704 --> 48:01.036
Do I need to engage someone else
to take care of this?

48:01.038 --> 48:03.138
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, Su Feng.

48:03.140 --> 48:04.541
Everything's under control,
all right?

48:04.543 --> 48:06.376
<i>If this is under control,</i>

48:06.378 --> 48:08.445
I'd hate to see
what out of control looks like.

48:08.447 --> 48:10.380
It'll look like me decimating
any other team

48:10.382 --> 48:11.347
that gets in my way,

48:11.349 --> 48:14.083
so back off
and let us do our job.

48:14.085 --> 48:15.652
You should come and see me.

48:15.654 --> 48:16.852
<i>Not yet.</i>

48:16.854 --> 48:18.854
I'll have this spotless
before the sun comes up.

48:18.856 --> 48:20.222
I'll come and see you then.

48:23.995 --> 48:25.495
Freeze!

48:25.497 --> 48:26.398
Put your hands up!

48:28.165 --> 48:29.999
I haven't got time for this.

48:30.001 --> 48:32.837
Turn back!
Put your hands on your head!

48:34.640 --> 48:36.375
You're makin'
a big mistake, pal.

48:45.816 --> 48:47.318
We're after the same people.

48:48.720 --> 48:49.619
We should talk.

48:49.621 --> 48:51.322
I'm a little busy
right now, mate.

48:53.558 --> 48:54.493
Drop the gun.

48:59.330 --> 49:00.231
Stand up.

49:04.201 --> 49:05.834
What do you want?

49:05.836 --> 49:07.238
Let's not play games.

49:08.674 --> 49:10.039
I could work with you.

49:10.041 --> 49:12.041
I can help you take down
the dude that you're after.

49:12.043 --> 49:13.743
I'm not looking
for an apprentice right now.

49:13.745 --> 49:15.612
Thank you very much.

49:15.614 --> 49:18.415
Who exactly are they,
and what do you want with them?

49:18.417 --> 49:21.751
They're mercenaries,
like me.

49:21.753 --> 49:24.320
I've been after them for years.

49:24.322 --> 49:27.624
Looking at your situation,
I'd say you need some help.

49:27.626 --> 49:30.159
And how exactly do you suppose
you're gonna help me?

49:30.161 --> 49:32.127
I know my way around the city.

49:32.129 --> 49:34.533
And I know the same people
they do and how they work.

49:37.436 --> 49:39.301
Long-Fei and Payu,

49:39.303 --> 49:41.837
they also have the girl
you're after.

49:41.839 --> 49:45.009
Look, if we work together,
we can both get what we want.

49:48.279 --> 49:50.014
You can certainly
handle yourself.

49:51.383 --> 49:53.951
Maybe I could use a little bit
of local assistance.

49:56.320 --> 49:57.387
We better get out of here

49:57.389 --> 49:59.056
before his mates turn up
don't you?

50:00.991 --> 50:02.126
Yeah.

50:14.305 --> 50:15.538
What were you doing

50:15.540 --> 50:17.039
at the police station?

50:17.041 --> 50:18.974
We were
in an underground fight.

50:18.976 --> 50:21.178
There may have been
some gambling involved.

50:25.650 --> 50:26.850
Did you guys win?

50:26.852 --> 50:29.253
Of course. We are professionals.

50:32.424 --> 50:33.425
And he is?

50:35.126 --> 50:36.360
That's Payu.

50:38.497 --> 50:42.064
Payu, thank you for saving me.

50:42.066 --> 50:43.167
Thank you.

50:44.536 --> 50:46.268
Anytime.

50:46.270 --> 50:48.270
Can I trust you guys?

50:48.272 --> 50:51.909
The police aren't an option.
Do you have a choice?

50:55.146 --> 50:56.448
I grew up near here.

51:23.274 --> 51:24.376
Go, go, go.

51:27.044 --> 51:28.445
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

51:28.447 --> 51:29.712
Get down.

51:29.714 --> 51:30.780
What are you doing?

51:30.782 --> 51:33.148
You drive. I'll navigate.

51:33.150 --> 51:35.117
You realize
this is a cop car, right?

51:35.119 --> 51:36.621
We're just going to borrow it.

51:38.956 --> 51:40.022
You should drive.

51:40.024 --> 51:41.458
This is a girl's car.

51:41.460 --> 51:44.394
Since when do cars have genders?
This is not the time to joke.

51:44.396 --> 51:46.295
I'm not joking. I can't drive.

51:46.297 --> 51:48.431
What do you mean
you can't drive?

51:48.433 --> 51:50.867
I mean,
I don't know how to drive.

51:50.869 --> 51:52.769
You're a professional?
How come you can't drive?

51:52.771 --> 51:55.003
I'm a professional,
just not a professional driver.

51:55.005 --> 51:56.071
Shit.

51:56.073 --> 51:57.174
Here.

52:13.792 --> 52:15.525
Hey, my car!

52:15.527 --> 52:16.426
Hey, stop!

52:16.428 --> 52:18.093
Where are you going?

52:18.095 --> 52:19.194
Look,

52:19.196 --> 52:20.530
we'll get the job done,
all right?

52:20.532 --> 52:21.564
Trust me.

52:21.566 --> 52:23.298
It'll be business
as usual before...

52:23.300 --> 52:24.536
Hello?

52:37.081 --> 52:39.181
So, what's up?

52:39.183 --> 52:41.818
Ah, that Su Feng meeting
didn't go well.

52:41.820 --> 52:44.286
She's even more pissed off
than she normally is.

52:44.288 --> 52:45.724
You said
you could handle it.

52:46.625 --> 52:47.991
Yeah.

52:47.993 --> 52:49.159
So, what does that mean?

52:51.563 --> 52:53.796
Well, it's pretty simple,
really.

52:53.798 --> 52:56.131
We've got 48 hours
to execute those little pricks

52:56.133 --> 52:57.234
and if we don't,

52:58.637 --> 53:00.137
contract reverts to us.

53:04.108 --> 53:05.744
Nah, not alcohol.

53:09.881 --> 53:11.313
Jesus.

53:11.315 --> 53:15.052
Remind me and the lads
why we need you again.

53:16.253 --> 53:17.756
All of you are ex-military.

53:18.823 --> 53:20.857
Maybe special forces?

53:20.859 --> 53:22.559
Martial arts training.

53:22.561 --> 53:25.397
But maybe a bit out of shape.

53:27.298 --> 53:29.032
You don't know us well enough
to be making

53:29.034 --> 53:30.234
that kind of statement now,
do you?

53:33.605 --> 53:34.537
You were saying?

53:34.539 --> 53:36.539
All right, calm down.

53:36.541 --> 53:37.442
Devereaux.

53:39.143 --> 53:40.410
He's useful.

53:40.412 --> 53:42.781
Crew is light anyways,
so I say we keep him.

53:48.620 --> 53:52.222
Like I said, if you're going
after Long-Fei and Payu,

53:53.123 --> 53:54.358
you need my help.

53:56.360 --> 53:59.562
This little motherfucker
just doesn't quit, does he?

53:59.564 --> 54:02.498
Look, we've got contacts
coming out of our asses, mate.

54:02.500 --> 54:04.701
Pretty soon, someone somewhere
is gonna give her up.

54:04.703 --> 54:07.772
She is well-connected in China
and has nowhere to go.

54:09.641 --> 54:11.342
She will head
to the Chinese Embassy.

54:23.855 --> 54:25.287
I thought Maha Jaya

54:25.289 --> 54:26.658
fixed their traffic problem.

54:28.560 --> 54:30.627
Something is wrong.

54:30.629 --> 54:32.929
This can't be
a coincidence.

54:32.931 --> 54:34.231
It has to be them.

54:43.340 --> 54:44.609
Can I borrow your phone?

54:45.076 --> 54:46.176
Okay.

54:52.517 --> 54:54.484
Xiao Xian, where are you?

54:54.486 --> 54:56.519
Madame Liang,
I hope you're better now.

54:56.521 --> 54:59.789
We can see the embassy,

54:59.791 --> 55:02.659
but we're stuck
behind the roadblock.

55:02.661 --> 55:06.328
<i>There was a bomb threat
at the embassy.</i>

55:06.330 --> 55:08.566
<i>We think it was them.</i>

55:17.876 --> 55:18.943
It's all blocked.

55:19.844 --> 55:21.243
Who are you with?

55:21.245 --> 55:23.682
Some new friends.
They're helping me out.

55:25.282 --> 55:26.549
I'm moving now.

55:28.887 --> 55:29.854
Go, go, go!

55:31.056 --> 55:32.390
Go. Drive.

55:34.159 --> 55:35.658
Drive!

55:37.128 --> 55:38.596
Faster. Go, go!

55:47.038 --> 55:48.805
Come on!

55:48.807 --> 55:50.373
Get back to the van
and cut 'em off.

55:50.375 --> 55:51.509
Yeah, yeah.

56:06.691 --> 56:07.592
Hey!

56:35.987 --> 56:37.453
Are you okay?

56:37.455 --> 56:38.788
Who is he?

56:38.790 --> 56:40.290
Not a friend.

56:42.292 --> 56:43.995
We have to go. Now!

56:47.365 --> 56:49.031
Let me see.

56:49.033 --> 56:49.934
Huh?

56:53.471 --> 56:55.638
To the center, do you copy?

56:55.640 --> 56:56.741
No one's here.

57:01.846 --> 57:03.012
Jaka.

57:03.014 --> 57:05.148
They're in the other market.

57:05.150 --> 57:07.150
Between Kwang and Kent.

57:07.152 --> 57:08.453
- Jaka.
- What are you doing?

57:09.921 --> 57:11.687
You used us a bait.

57:11.689 --> 57:13.256
Be patient, my friend.

57:13.258 --> 57:16.092
My fight is with Collins,
not you.

57:16.094 --> 57:17.327
Just keep moving.

57:20.198 --> 57:21.432
It's your funeral, man.

57:29.808 --> 57:30.775
This way!

57:34.746 --> 57:36.748
They were here.
We just lost them.

57:38.483 --> 57:40.049
And here you are.

57:40.051 --> 57:42.585
I followed them from the crash.
Lost them in the market.

57:42.587 --> 57:44.620
You're always in the right place
at the right time, huh?

57:44.622 --> 57:45.755
That's why you need me.

57:45.757 --> 57:47.523
Collins, over here.

57:47.525 --> 57:49.492
Good job.

57:49.494 --> 57:52.829
You know my gut
has kept me alive,

57:52.831 --> 57:54.831
sort of like a sixth sense.

57:54.833 --> 57:56.601
And you know
what my gut is telling me?

57:57.334 --> 57:59.001
You're up to something.

57:59.003 --> 58:02.605
If you have a point to make,
make it.

58:02.607 --> 58:04.542
Oh, I will, when the time comes.

58:13.518 --> 58:14.886
Wait. Stop.

58:38.509 --> 58:40.812
You go that way.
I'll sweep 'em towards ya.

58:49.754 --> 58:51.320
Hold on, mate.

58:51.322 --> 58:52.488
Sorry, not open.

58:52.490 --> 58:53.691
Health department.

58:57.095 --> 58:58.663
I'm the vice terminator.

59:52.517 --> 59:54.185
Looks like
you passed the inspection.

01:00:07.799 --> 01:00:09.966
The Maha Jaya Police Department

01:00:09.968 --> 01:00:11.734
is overwhelmed.

01:00:11.736 --> 01:00:16.305
They can't
guarantee Xiao Xian's safety.

01:00:16.307 --> 01:00:21.677
The search will have to wait

01:00:21.679 --> 01:00:25.016
until additional support
arrives tomorrow.

01:00:57.515 --> 01:00:58.716
Can I see it?

01:01:01.652 --> 01:01:03.886
Yeah.

01:01:03.888 --> 01:01:05.923
Looks like
we're stuck here for the night.

01:01:07.859 --> 01:01:09.393
Great.

01:01:09.395 --> 01:01:13.162
Tell me how
you know these people?

01:01:13.164 --> 01:01:14.130
We were hired

01:01:14.132 --> 01:01:15.998
for a humanitarian
rescue mission, only it wasn't.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.536
Instead, they freed Collins
and left us for dead.

01:01:21.039 --> 01:01:23.440
And who is the guy
at the market?

01:01:23.442 --> 01:01:26.909
He's with the foreigners,
but he's one of us.

01:01:26.911 --> 01:01:28.544
It's complicated.

01:01:28.546 --> 01:01:29.647
Complicated?

01:01:30.482 --> 01:01:33.383
His people were killed

01:01:33.385 --> 01:01:35.787
when the camp was destroyed.

01:01:36.554 --> 01:01:37.688
So, he's a mole?

01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:40.091
Sort of.

01:01:43.027 --> 01:01:45.327
So the two of you
are responsible for this?

01:01:45.329 --> 01:01:47.296
Now, what?

01:01:47.298 --> 01:01:51.769
Now, we take cover here
for the night.

01:01:52.937 --> 01:01:55.940
Tomorrow, we can try
the embassy again.

01:01:56.674 --> 01:01:57.775
Sit.

01:02:01.245 --> 01:02:05.683
I guess you can only call in
so many bomb threats.

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.753
May I take your orders?

01:02:10.755 --> 01:02:12.822
Hi all. I'm Payu, your chef.

01:02:12.824 --> 01:02:15.492
Today, I proudly present
to you my best dish,

01:02:15.494 --> 01:02:18.160
stir-fried swamp cabbage!

01:02:20.331 --> 01:02:24.333
It's best served with hot soup,
which we're gonna have...

01:02:24.335 --> 01:02:27.271
Oops... River prawn spicy soup!

01:02:28.706 --> 01:02:31.707
Payu was a field cook.

01:02:31.709 --> 01:02:33.142
A damn good one.

01:02:33.144 --> 01:02:35.311
You like spicy? Ooh.

01:02:51.762 --> 01:02:53.195
Let's keep lookin'.

01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:06.842
So was it
your dad's mission or yours?

01:03:06.844 --> 01:03:09.381
It was my dad's mission
that I embraced.

01:03:10.482 --> 01:03:13.517
Enough about me. What about you?

01:03:13.519 --> 01:03:18.020
You two were obviously
professionally trained.

01:03:18.022 --> 01:03:19.790
Why did you leave China?

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.927
When I was young,
my father brought me here.

01:03:24.929 --> 01:03:27.196
We've been living here
since then.

01:03:27.198 --> 01:03:30.402
There's money
working security here.

01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:33.171
One job, two jobs.

01:03:34.338 --> 01:03:35.905
I want to make enough money

01:03:35.907 --> 01:03:38.441
to bring my father
back to China.

01:03:38.443 --> 01:03:40.678
But now, I cannot go home.

01:03:42.813 --> 01:03:47.384
Since you saved me,
maybe I can help you?

01:03:47.386 --> 01:03:51.856
I know a lot of people.
I'll find a way.

01:03:55.159 --> 01:03:59.828
Ladies
and gentlemen, dinner is served.

01:03:59.830 --> 01:04:00.932
Thank you.

01:04:02.333 --> 01:04:03.935
For me.

01:04:04.735 --> 01:04:05.970
Enjoy.

01:04:07.305 --> 01:04:09.939
This is actually
really delicious.

01:04:09.941 --> 01:04:13.142
You pick up a lot,
moving from place to place.

01:04:13.144 --> 01:04:14.511
Delicious.

01:04:14.513 --> 01:04:16.680
It's good.

01:04:16.682 --> 01:04:18.113
If it's good, then eat more.

01:04:18.115 --> 01:04:20.015
That's my beer.
The other one's yours.

01:04:20.017 --> 01:04:21.850
Of course, you do. All right.

01:04:21.852 --> 01:04:22.985
Toast?

01:04:22.987 --> 01:04:24.086
- Cheers.
- Cheers?

01:04:24.088 --> 01:04:25.821
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah, cheers.

01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:39.802
We're gonna have
every syndicate hit squad

01:04:39.804 --> 01:04:41.471
in bloody Indochina on our cases

01:04:41.473 --> 01:04:44.240
if we don't snare these
three little imps sometime soon.

01:04:44.242 --> 01:04:46.275
I am painfully aware of that.

01:04:46.277 --> 01:04:47.843
It's gonna get
a lot more painful

01:04:47.845 --> 01:04:50.781
if we don't solve
this problem... quickly.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:04.295
<i>Dummy. I'm always here.</i>

01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:10.266
I should
never have brought you.

01:05:10.268 --> 01:05:11.869
<i>I just wanted
you with me.</i>

01:05:17.576 --> 01:05:19.141
<i>I promise that
when everything is over</i>

01:05:19.143 --> 01:05:20.878
<i>and they are dead,</i>

01:05:22.381 --> 01:05:25.016
<i>I will live my life
and make you proud.</i>

01:05:26.418 --> 01:05:28.219
<i>I will convince them
to trust me.</i>

01:05:31.822 --> 01:05:33.357
I will kill them
with my bare hands.

01:05:34.559 --> 01:05:36.327
I will kill them
with my bare hands.

01:05:41.832 --> 01:05:43.435
<i>On my...</i>

01:05:45.737 --> 01:05:47.238
<i>terms...</i>

01:05:51.075 --> 01:05:52.843
at the right time.

01:06:03.287 --> 01:06:06.023
I will face them
one by one.

01:06:21.272 --> 01:06:22.505
Going to the Embassy

01:06:22.507 --> 01:06:23.440
is a mistake.

01:06:23.442 --> 01:06:26.643
The cartel will do anything
to stop my donation.

01:06:26.645 --> 01:06:28.979
That's all that matters to me.

01:06:30.582 --> 01:06:32.283
I'm the one they're looking for.

01:06:33.117 --> 01:06:34.718
So give me up.

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:35.918
I don't think so.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.152
Use me as bait.

01:06:37.154 --> 01:06:38.523
It's too dangerous.

01:06:40.625 --> 01:06:43.092
Well, we need to come up
with some sort of plan.

01:06:43.094 --> 01:06:45.229
You know this is the only way
it could work.

01:06:47.632 --> 01:06:48.600
She's right.

01:06:50.569 --> 01:06:52.769
I have an idea.

01:06:52.771 --> 01:06:53.871
Ah, cheers, mate.

01:06:55.474 --> 01:06:59.975
Bullshit. Bullshit.
Donnie and Sam, okay, cool.

01:07:02.079 --> 01:07:05.080
Ha-ha.
If it isn't the man of the hour.

01:07:05.082 --> 01:07:06.915
Let me speak to Collins.

01:07:06.917 --> 01:07:08.016
Well, I'm pretty sure

01:07:08.018 --> 01:07:09.652
he'd like to speak
with you, too.

01:07:09.654 --> 01:07:12.321
Hey, Collins, this is precious.

01:07:12.323 --> 01:07:14.957
You're gonna wanna see this.

01:07:14.959 --> 01:07:17.292
Well, hello, hello, hello, mate.
How's it goin'?

01:07:17.294 --> 01:07:20.730
How's your feet? They hurtin'?
Yeah, I fuckin' hope so.

01:07:20.732 --> 01:07:23.533
<i>I have something you want.
Let's talk.</i>

01:07:23.535 --> 01:07:25.502
We're talkin' now, champ.

01:07:25.504 --> 01:07:27.905
<i>We have Xian.
You want her?</i>

01:07:31.410 --> 01:07:33.676
Oh, well, fuck me,
I was not expecting that.

01:07:33.678 --> 01:07:34.910
- It's bullshit, bro.
- Wait, wait.

01:07:34.912 --> 01:07:36.011
Let's see what he's gotta say.

01:07:36.013 --> 01:07:37.312
What you got in mind,
my little friend?

01:07:37.314 --> 01:07:39.682
Dawn,
at the old Polo club.

01:07:39.684 --> 01:07:44.321
<i>You get what you want, I get
$100,000 and our freedom.</i>

01:07:45.956 --> 01:07:47.492
A hundred thousand dollars, eh?

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:49.459
Yeah, all right.

01:07:49.461 --> 01:07:50.794
Got yourself a deal.

01:07:50.796 --> 01:07:53.228
But do me favor, don't be late.

01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:55.099
I've got a deadline to meet.

01:07:57.669 --> 01:08:00.135
Now you know he's trying
to set us up, right?

01:08:00.137 --> 01:08:01.937
Don't tell me you trust
that little bastard.

01:08:01.939 --> 01:08:04.273
No, I don't trust him.

01:08:04.275 --> 01:08:05.642
But I do trust
that they'll be there

01:08:05.644 --> 01:08:07.644
whether they're settin' us up
or not.

01:08:07.646 --> 01:08:10.513
So I say we use
all the cash we got left.

01:08:10.515 --> 01:08:13.416
You find me as many shooters
as you can wrangle.

01:08:13.418 --> 01:08:14.316
- Shooters?
- Yeah.

01:08:14.318 --> 01:08:17.185
Ugly motherfuckers with guns
who get paid to kill people.

01:08:17.188 --> 01:08:19.589
- I know what shooters are.
- Well, good.

01:08:19.591 --> 01:08:22.024
We get there early.
We don't fuck about.

01:08:22.026 --> 01:08:23.725
We set a few little traps.

01:08:23.728 --> 01:08:26.563
And instead
of negotiating the trade,

01:08:26.564 --> 01:08:28.430
we fuckin' annihilate
these little pricks,

01:08:28.433 --> 01:08:29.832
now how's that for trust?

01:08:29.835 --> 01:08:30.934
Well, it's about time,

01:08:30.935 --> 01:08:33.203
'cause I'm sick of playin'
fuckin' hide-and-seek.

01:09:04.368 --> 01:09:06.002
Welcome back, Payu.

01:09:07.136 --> 01:09:08.506
Let's talk inside.

01:09:17.046 --> 01:09:19.113
<i>Why are
you here, Payu?</i>

01:09:19.116 --> 01:09:20.317
You callin' in your marker?

01:09:22.386 --> 01:09:24.287
What makes you think
I would honor it?

01:09:25.221 --> 01:09:26.491
You are many things,

01:09:27.425 --> 01:09:28.325
but...

01:09:29.861 --> 01:09:31.462
I know you keep you word.

01:09:33.564 --> 01:09:36.267
You haven't told your friends
about our past, have you?

01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:40.435
How you earned your name.

01:09:41.406 --> 01:09:44.171
Payu, the tempest.

01:09:44.174 --> 01:09:46.243
One that destroys
all that it touches.

01:09:47.412 --> 01:09:49.514
Not everything I did was good.

01:09:52.349 --> 01:09:54.116
He worked with me.

01:09:54.118 --> 01:09:56.318
Killed 12 men
in one attack.

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:58.421
I can't say
they didn't deserve it.

01:09:58.423 --> 01:09:59.722
- Then he left.
- No, no, no.

01:09:59.724 --> 01:10:01.323
- Next thing you know,
- Stop.

01:10:01.325 --> 01:10:03.726
He's a soldier of fortune
working far and wide.

01:10:03.728 --> 01:10:04.629
Enough!

01:10:05.797 --> 01:10:07.097
You owe me.

01:10:09.935 --> 01:10:11.367
What do you want, Payu?

01:10:11.369 --> 01:10:13.103
I need weapons.

01:10:22.814 --> 01:10:23.815
Take what you want.

01:10:26.685 --> 01:10:27.619
We're square.

01:10:44.636 --> 01:10:46.836
Your donation's
not gonna change anything.

01:10:46.838 --> 01:10:50.006
You remove one regime
and another takes its place.

01:10:50.008 --> 01:10:52.510
You need to stay alive
to make a difference.

01:10:54.613 --> 01:10:56.414
Do you have anything
more substantial?

01:10:59.951 --> 01:11:01.684
Get in. Okay.

01:11:01.686 --> 01:11:02.587
Payu!

01:11:03.722 --> 01:11:06.691
Don't forget what I said.
We're even.

01:11:36.353 --> 01:11:40.155
So, we're gonna take care
of these little shits

01:11:40.157 --> 01:11:41.256
and get back to business.

01:11:41.258 --> 01:11:42.659
This is business right now.

01:11:42.661 --> 01:11:44.494
Split into pairs.
Get into position.

01:11:44.496 --> 01:11:46.798
Cover the main area. All right?

01:11:47.666 --> 01:11:48.566
Go!

01:11:53.471 --> 01:11:54.906
This ends tonight.

01:11:58.710 --> 01:12:01.946
Ah, used one of those before,
haven't you?

01:12:03.615 --> 01:12:07.419
You know, you look like somebody
who, uh, knows their guns.

01:12:10.121 --> 01:12:11.656
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

01:12:13.323 --> 01:12:15.625
Hey, what are you anyway, man?

01:12:15.627 --> 01:12:17.994
Cambodian? Vietnamese?

01:12:17.996 --> 01:12:19.429
Indonesia.

01:12:19.431 --> 01:12:20.732
Indonesian!

01:12:22.367 --> 01:12:23.702
Indonesian!

01:12:24.334 --> 01:12:25.768
Yeah, yeah, man.

01:12:25.770 --> 01:12:27.437
We ran
into some Indonesians.

01:12:27.439 --> 01:12:29.337
Up in the north.

01:12:29.339 --> 01:12:31.443
Yeah, they were being used
as camp security.

01:12:32.276 --> 01:12:34.311
Yeah, yeah. They were terrible.

01:12:36.481 --> 01:12:38.614
We deep sixed 'em all.

01:12:38.616 --> 01:12:40.483
Left 'em
in the sun to bloat

01:12:40.485 --> 01:12:42.284
and feed the flies.

01:12:42.286 --> 01:12:45.154
That doesn't bother you,
does it?

01:12:45.156 --> 01:12:46.524
Wouldn't be anyone
you knew, right?

01:12:47.559 --> 01:12:49.392
C'mon, speak up.

01:12:49.394 --> 01:12:51.861
We all on the same team. Huh?

01:12:51.863 --> 01:12:53.096
Get off my back.

01:12:53.098 --> 01:12:54.499
I'll get off your back.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.767
I just thought it was something
that you wanted

01:12:57.769 --> 01:12:59.003
to get off your little chest.

01:13:03.141 --> 01:13:04.040
Your shooters clear

01:13:04.042 --> 01:13:06.042
on what we expect
from them, Devereaux?

01:13:06.044 --> 01:13:08.878
Yeah, I got eight guns
pointed at me right now.

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:09.914
All right, good.

01:13:11.015 --> 01:13:12.383
Let's get this done.

01:14:22.187 --> 01:14:24.754
Where's the other mouseketeer?

01:14:24.756 --> 01:14:27.355
He's outside,
making sure we weren't followed.

01:14:27.357 --> 01:14:29.125
Is he?

01:14:29.127 --> 01:14:31.563
Well, that's all right.
We had the same idea, didn't we?

01:14:32.697 --> 01:14:34.997
Your team double-crossed us.

01:14:34.999 --> 01:14:36.100
Left us for dead.

01:14:37.334 --> 01:14:39.168
They did.

01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:41.940
But that was then, this is now.

01:14:44.108 --> 01:14:46.042
So are we gonna do this or what?

01:15:01.693 --> 01:15:03.494
There's your money
in that case...

01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:06.764
just like we agreed.

01:15:21.579 --> 01:15:23.713
Why don't you come over here,
darlin'?

01:15:23.715 --> 01:15:24.814
Don't worry.

01:15:24.816 --> 01:15:26.384
Promise I'll make it quick.

01:15:27.252 --> 01:15:28.718
Do you remember the first time

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:30.419
you felt your soul
slipping away?

01:15:30.421 --> 01:15:31.487
My soul?

01:15:33.725 --> 01:15:35.660
No, there's no souls here,
sweetheart.

01:15:36.628 --> 01:15:37.860
Just a bunch of blokes

01:15:37.862 --> 01:15:39.795
doin' our jobs
like everyone else.

01:15:42.333 --> 01:15:43.799
Now granted,

01:15:43.801 --> 01:15:45.134
wasn't exactly
what I wanted to be doing

01:15:45.136 --> 01:15:46.402
when I was all grown up,

01:15:46.404 --> 01:15:47.603
but you know what?

01:15:47.605 --> 01:15:49.107
Turned out
I was pretty bloody good at it.

01:15:50.708 --> 01:15:53.544
There's you money,
just like I agreed.

01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:57.949
The girl, send her over.

01:16:02.186 --> 01:16:03.986
The girl! Now!

01:16:23.942 --> 01:16:26.410
Aim the gun, pull the trigger,

01:16:26.412 --> 01:16:27.510
until it's empty.

01:16:27.512 --> 01:16:28.579
Got it.

01:16:36.587 --> 01:16:37.689
Shit.

01:17:13.691 --> 01:17:17.028
The Indonesians you killed
were my people.

01:17:18.129 --> 01:17:20.064
I buried my wife
because of you.

01:17:21.199 --> 01:17:22.500
This is personal.

01:17:33.211 --> 01:17:34.176
That's the dumbest thing

01:17:34.178 --> 01:17:35.847
you're never gonna live
to regret.

01:17:36.647 --> 01:17:38.114
Let's see.

01:18:10.516 --> 01:18:12.083
Come on, you rat boss!

01:19:06.838 --> 01:19:09.238
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:11.841
Come on!
Let's see what you got.

01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:06.857
Not bad for a little man.

01:21:10.094 --> 01:21:11.860
Does it have to be this way?

01:21:11.862 --> 01:21:13.295
I'm afraid it does.

01:21:13.297 --> 01:21:15.400
We finish this
right fuckin' here!

01:21:48.132 --> 01:21:50.935
You'll be seeing
your wife soon. Shh.

01:22:27.305 --> 01:22:28.507
Hello?

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.073
Who is this?

01:22:31.075 --> 01:22:32.442
<i>Tian Xiao Xian</i>

01:22:32.444 --> 01:22:33.842
<i>is at the abandoned
Polo club.</i>

01:22:33.844 --> 01:22:35.412
<i>Send somebody
to rescue her.</i>

01:22:35.414 --> 01:22:36.646
Hello?

01:22:36.648 --> 01:22:38.483
Hello? Hello?

01:23:28.299 --> 01:23:30.199
You know,
you're a pretty good fighter.

01:23:30.201 --> 01:23:31.900
I'm gonna teach you
a lesson.

01:23:31.902 --> 01:23:33.938
Talk, talk, talk.

01:23:47.386 --> 01:23:50.655
Now look at you.
You're weak and pathetic.

01:24:04.001 --> 01:24:06.836
You sneaky, little bastard!

01:24:06.838 --> 01:24:09.138
I should've listened
to Devereaux, shouldn't I?

01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:11.576
He's dead, as you will be soon.

01:24:13.612 --> 01:24:15.647
Well, I reckon
I fancy these odds anyway.

01:24:41.105 --> 01:24:42.938
Come on there, village boy.

01:25:24.916 --> 01:25:26.718
Jaka? Jaka!

01:25:48.205 --> 01:25:49.304
You pissed off

01:25:49.306 --> 01:25:51.041
some really
important people, girl.

01:25:52.243 --> 01:25:55.145
For that, you have my respect.

01:25:59.718 --> 01:26:00.619
Uh-uh.

01:26:02.521 --> 01:26:03.421
Drop it.

01:26:09.995 --> 01:26:11.095
Slide it over.

01:26:12.129 --> 01:26:13.330
Slide it over!

01:26:23.742 --> 01:26:25.274
It's about time
I cash my paycheck,

01:26:25.276 --> 01:26:26.709
don't you think?

01:26:32.918 --> 01:26:35.552
Jesus Christ!

01:26:35.554 --> 01:26:39.187
Why the fuck is it so hard
to kill one little Chinese girl?

01:26:42.861 --> 01:26:45.296
You left me for dead... twice.

01:26:46.865 --> 01:26:49.233
It will not happen again.

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:11.286
You come and have a go,
if you think you're hard enough.

01:28:22.594 --> 01:28:25.227
Is that all you got? Huh?

01:28:25.229 --> 01:28:26.963
You shoulda stayed in the pits!

01:28:26.965 --> 01:28:29.132
Less talk, just die.

01:28:48.318 --> 01:28:50.955
Talk, talk, talk.

01:28:51.890 --> 01:28:53.357
No more talk.

01:29:27.759 --> 01:29:29.394
That's enough.

01:29:30.095 --> 01:29:30.995
He's dead.

01:29:32.764 --> 01:29:33.665
Are you sure?

01:29:39.437 --> 01:29:40.538
Thank you.

01:30:21.079 --> 01:30:21.980
Xiao Xian.

01:30:24.415 --> 01:30:25.715
We were worried sick.

01:30:25.717 --> 01:30:29.387
We came as soon
as we got Jaka's phone call.

01:30:32.023 --> 01:30:32.957
Jaka?

01:30:35.827 --> 01:30:37.527
<i>I have
some good news.</i>

01:30:37.529 --> 01:30:42.999
<i>We've arrested
the person responsible.</i>

01:30:43.001 --> 01:30:46.336
<i>She's being extradited
to Singapore.</i>

01:30:54.012 --> 01:30:55.545
Stop right there.

01:30:55.547 --> 01:30:58.082
You're under arrest. Get up.

01:31:06.691 --> 01:31:09.527
I told you... I had a plan.

01:31:11.729 --> 01:31:14.297
Good plan. We almost died.

01:31:14.299 --> 01:31:15.667
Next time, you get shot.

01:31:25.743 --> 01:31:27.210
Bye.

01:31:27.212 --> 01:31:28.379
See you, man.
