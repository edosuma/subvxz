WEBVTT

01:11.322 --> 01:12.365
That is my knife.

01:20.749 --> 01:23.668
That is my knife.

01:24.502 --> 01:25.920
No, it is not.

01:30.258 --> 01:31.384
Give it to me.

01:31.509 --> 01:32.677
You're crazy.
It's not your knife.

01:33.344 --> 01:34.846
Father gave me this knife.

01:35.764 --> 01:37.182
I want it.

01:40.143 --> 01:44.147
I will kill Lagertha with it.
I will kill Lagertha
with Father's knife!

01:44.814 --> 01:46.191
Well, you can't have it.

01:46.524 --> 01:47.859
That's enough!

01:53.865 --> 01:55.033
Give it to me!

02:00.205 --> 02:01.998
Get up! Hey!

02:02.707 --> 02:04.793
We have important
decisions to make.

02:05.043 --> 02:07.128
As usual, you must
tell us how to behave!

02:08.213 --> 02:09.714
Who else would do it?

02:12.008 --> 02:13.885
I wish Bjorn was here.

02:14.886 --> 02:16.679
You think he
knows about Father?

02:16.846 --> 02:20.725
So,
you think that Odin told us,
but forgot to tell Bjorn? Hmm?

02:21.601 --> 02:23.228
Hopefully he
will be home soon.

02:23.728 --> 02:27.315
In the meantime,
it is up to us to
decide what to do.

02:27.857 --> 02:32.028
I'm listening.
Say something interesting.

02:33.488 --> 02:35.490
You heard what he said,

02:35.573 --> 02:36.741
how the little
pigs will grunt when

02:36.825 --> 02:38.076
they hear how
the old boar suffered.

02:40.370 --> 02:41.913
So, now we're grunting.

02:41.996 --> 02:43.248
So what?

02:43.498 --> 02:46.084
We want blood-revenge
against Aelle, hmm?

02:46.292 --> 02:47.293
Yes.

02:47.377 --> 02:49.462
Not only against Aelle.

02:49.546 --> 02:51.714
I told you.

02:52.757 --> 02:55.927
King Ecbert
offered our father up
like a sacrifice,

02:56.010 --> 02:57.929
so we'll do
the same thing to him.

03:00.014 --> 03:02.142
That is what Father wanted.

03:03.601 --> 03:06.896
That is the message
that he wanted me
to bring to you.

03:08.356 --> 03:10.150
That is so easy
to say, Ivar.

03:12.569 --> 03:15.989
There he is,
the voice of reason.

03:18.032 --> 03:19.492
I hate reason.

03:21.786 --> 03:24.080
What do you mean, Ubbe?

03:24.164 --> 03:25.707
I'm listening,
even if he's not.

03:25.790 --> 03:29.460
Aelle has a small kingdom
but Ecbert's kingdom is vast.

03:29.627 --> 03:31.337
How do we overcome
that when we have

03:31.421 --> 03:33.798
never attempted
anything like that before?

03:35.884 --> 03:37.302
We raise an army.

03:37.385 --> 03:39.220
No, you're not listening,
brother.

03:39.304 --> 03:40.847
We raise a great army.

03:41.514 --> 03:43.474
An army bigger
than ever before.

03:46.644 --> 03:48.229
Sigurd is right.

03:52.317 --> 03:57.447
We call in favors.
We do deals with kings
and earls that we hate.

03:59.032 --> 04:03.077
Whatever we have
to promise them,
we promise, and in the end,

04:03.995 --> 04:06.497
we assemble
an army twice the size

04:06.581 --> 04:09.292
of the army our father
took to Paris.

04:10.668 --> 04:11.753
And we declare
war on England.

04:12.337 --> 04:13.838
No.

04:15.089 --> 04:19.219
In the name of
our dead father,
in the name of Ragnar Lothbrok

04:19.302 --> 04:22.722
the greatest
hero of our country.

04:23.348 --> 04:25.558
And in the name of Odin,

04:27.477 --> 04:31.481
we declare war
on the whole world.

04:55.964 --> 04:57.048
Ready to board!

05:08.977 --> 05:10.895
Frankia.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.940
Home?

05:15.566 --> 05:18.486
I don't know.

05:19.445 --> 05:21.906
Difficult to return.

05:24.742 --> 05:29.080
When we return,
Hvitserk and I,
and our brothers...

05:30.707 --> 05:33.668
We will have to
avenge our father's death.

05:34.877 --> 05:38.381
And that would be
difficult for you, too.

05:38.756 --> 05:43.469
You would not be welcome,
for what you did to all of us.

05:46.264 --> 05:48.224
And I would
have to kill you.

06:09.454 --> 06:10.955
Shield wall!

06:19.881 --> 06:21.799
Let him pass.

06:25.928 --> 06:26.971
Ubbe.

06:28.348 --> 06:31.934
The work seems to
be going very well.
I am impressed.

06:32.352 --> 06:33.895
Kattegat is worth defending.

06:34.771 --> 06:36.689
I remember,
a long time ago, when it was

06:36.773 --> 06:39.567
nothing but a few houses,
a single jetty.

06:39.817 --> 06:42.070
I know very well
what happened to Kattegat,
Lagertha.

06:42.153 --> 06:43.488
I was born here
and I grew up here.

06:46.574 --> 06:48.618
We are going
to raise an army

06:48.701 --> 06:51.537
to invade England
and avenge the death
of our father.

06:52.246 --> 06:54.499
Will you come with us?

06:57.085 --> 06:59.420
Would you really want me
to come with you?

07:00.171 --> 07:03.424
We will need all
the help we can get.

07:03.508 --> 07:05.259
After all,
don't you have a reason?

07:12.934 --> 07:16.312
I also have
a reason to stay here.

07:17.188 --> 07:22.026
I understand you are
inviting other rulers
to come and join your army.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.946
Don't you think
some of them will be envious

07:25.029 --> 07:26.406
when they see
the size and understand

07:26.489 --> 07:27.990
the value of this
trading station?

07:29.617 --> 07:33.704
It depends, I suppose,
on what is more
important to you.

07:35.748 --> 07:38.501
That's not
worthy of you, Ubbe.

07:38.584 --> 07:41.421
I know what your father
would have wanted me to do.

07:47.885 --> 07:50.012
Astrid. Torvi.

07:52.765 --> 07:54.517
I do not trust him.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.019
I know he is not Ivar

07:57.854 --> 08:01.065
and yet he is Ivar!

08:01.232 --> 08:04.318
You should look to
improve your own security.

08:07.738 --> 08:12.201
If the gods
don't protect me,
then who can?

08:32.221 --> 08:33.806
What's her name?

08:35.475 --> 08:37.602
I think it is Tanaruz.

08:41.397 --> 08:43.566
She's very frightened,
Helga.

08:46.861 --> 08:48.488
Don't be afraid.

08:49.447 --> 08:53.451
I won't hurt you.
I will love you.

08:55.745 --> 08:57.538
Brother.

08:57.872 --> 08:59.499
When we reach Kattegat,

08:59.582 --> 09:02.960
Bjorn Ironside will
take all the profits
from these women.

09:04.712 --> 09:07.840
So he will. For now.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.638
And who is this?

09:13.763 --> 09:15.765
I didn't know him,
either.

09:15.890 --> 09:20.061
Turns out his father
is an earl.

09:22.021 --> 09:23.272
An earl?

09:24.065 --> 09:26.817
Why did you not say so?

09:29.487 --> 09:33.449
Because he's
the earl and I'm not.

09:35.076 --> 09:38.579
They call me
Egil the Bastard.

09:42.333 --> 09:45.336
But you would
like to be Earl?

09:49.090 --> 09:54.136
It's good that
we have met, Egil.
We need ambitious men.

10:19.412 --> 10:22.290
I still have a bone to pick
with you, Sigurd.

10:22.999 --> 10:26.502
Why were you silent
when I demanded
justice from Lagertha?

10:29.422 --> 10:32.008
We have different
memories of Mother.

10:32.216 --> 10:34.343
She doted on you,
and she ignored me.

10:34.885 --> 10:38.139
She had eyes only for
you and for Harbard.

10:38.931 --> 10:41.225
To me,
she was cold and distant.

10:41.392 --> 10:43.561
So you feel
sorry for yourself?

10:44.562 --> 10:45.730
Poor little Sigurd.

10:47.607 --> 10:50.067
You're wrong, Ivar.
I don't feel sorry
for myself.

10:50.151 --> 10:52.445
Yeah. Right.
No. Of course not.

10:55.406 --> 10:57.491
I'm telling you the truth.

10:57.617 --> 11:00.077
I have very good reason
not to feel so
angry with Lagertha.

11:02.913 --> 11:07.418
Then what kind of
a son are you, hmm?

11:09.086 --> 11:12.757
What does it matter
what your mother did to you?

11:12.840 --> 11:14.759
She was still your mother.

11:17.094 --> 11:18.429
You would say that,
wouldn't you?

11:19.055 --> 11:20.640
What does that mean?

11:20.973 --> 11:22.350
What do you
think it means?

11:23.392 --> 11:24.560
You tell me.

11:25.186 --> 11:26.979
All right,
I will, Mommy's boy.

11:28.022 --> 11:30.024
Mommy's little favorite.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.192
Are you just
really sad she can't

11:31.275 --> 11:32.443
breastfeed you anymore,
is that it?

11:36.781 --> 11:41.118
Whoever would have thought
that you two were brothers?

12:15.653 --> 12:18.572
To what do we owe
the honor of your visit?

12:21.158 --> 12:23.452
I wanted to see my family.

12:26.163 --> 12:27.915
I also wanted to warn you.

12:27.998 --> 12:29.750
You mean, Ecbert sent you.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.377
No.

12:31.544 --> 12:35.047
I came of my own devising.

12:35.965 --> 12:40.761
There is much
talk of the revenge
of the sons of Ragnar.

12:40.845 --> 12:45.182
I wanted you all
to be aware of it,
and prepared for it.

12:46.726 --> 12:50.479
You need not have
concerned yourself
as to travel so far.

12:50.563 --> 12:54.567
Why should I not be aware
of the habits of the heathen?

12:54.650 --> 12:56.318
I promise you.

12:56.402 --> 13:00.448
We are already well prepared
for any incursions
into our kingdom.

13:00.948 --> 13:06.162
I'm not sure you realize
the scale of their
possible retribution.

13:06.245 --> 13:10.499
Ragnar Lothbrok
was not only
their King, Father,

13:10.583 --> 13:14.128
he was the most famous man
in their world.

13:14.211 --> 13:17.840
Believe me, daughter,
I have taken stock of them.

13:17.923 --> 13:21.927
I know what to expect.
And we are fully prepared.

13:22.386 --> 13:25.681
Then should you not
reinstate your alliance
with King Ecbert?

13:25.765 --> 13:31.187
I have no wish or
need to be allied
to such a degenerate monarch.

13:31.687 --> 13:34.607
Daughter, we are all aware

13:34.690 --> 13:37.985
of your immoral relationship
with your father-in-law.

13:38.068 --> 13:40.237
It grieves us deeply.

13:41.030 --> 13:44.033
We pray that you will return
to your wedded husband

13:45.034 --> 13:49.580
and behave
as a Christian
wife ought to behave.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.874
I am grateful for
your concern, Mother.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.168
But there is no
need to pray for me.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.796
If we do not pray for
your soul, daughter,

13:56.879 --> 14:00.633
then you will be
damned for all eternity.

14:00.716 --> 14:02.009
If I am to hell,
at least I will enjoy

14:02.092 --> 14:03.677
the company of my
degenerate monarch.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.764
Judith! Blasphemous girl!

14:08.599 --> 14:09.767
As for you, Father,

14:09.850 --> 14:11.727
you may enjoy
the aridities of heaven

14:11.852 --> 14:13.687
without my
discomforting presence,

14:13.771 --> 14:18.442
and that of every other woman
whose only crime was
a desire to be free.

14:21.821 --> 14:24.490
There is something
I would like to see.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.362
Are you going to go home?

15:07.074 --> 15:09.326
I know what I have to do.

15:15.624 --> 15:17.167
I want to make
you all an offer.

15:20.045 --> 15:22.548
Anyone from our homelands

15:22.631 --> 15:25.759
who wants good,
rich lands to farm

15:26.844 --> 15:29.138
can come and
live in my kingdom.

15:31.515 --> 15:36.228
There will always
be a part of Frankia,
which is a part of us.

15:38.647 --> 15:39.899
Us?

15:41.483 --> 15:44.194
You are no longer
a part of "us," Rollo.

15:46.155 --> 15:48.741
But what is "us,"
Floki, is changing.

15:50.284 --> 15:51.952
Only you won't accept it.

15:55.039 --> 15:56.790
And so I say
the same to you.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.295
And you, Hvitserk.

16:02.212 --> 16:04.506
Too much bad blood, Rollo.

16:06.550 --> 16:09.011
Once a betrayer,
always a betrayer.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.144
Goodbye, Rollo.

16:20.022 --> 16:21.023
Goodbye, Helga.

16:23.859 --> 16:25.444
I won't forget.

16:28.072 --> 16:29.073
I won't forget anything.

16:59.687 --> 17:02.856
You should have killed him
when you had the chance.

17:03.774 --> 17:05.943
Why would you say that?

17:06.026 --> 17:07.611
Because I have
a bad feeling that

17:07.695 --> 17:09.863
he will reach more
fame than any of you.

17:31.135 --> 17:33.178
Husband.

17:33.721 --> 17:35.305
Gisla.

17:36.432 --> 17:37.850
Husband.

17:38.642 --> 17:40.060
You came back to us.

17:40.644 --> 17:44.064
Thank God.
Truly, thank God.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.233
Leave us.

19:10.859 --> 19:13.987
What are you doing?
You're not a slave anymore.

19:21.495 --> 19:23.705
- You can't decide that.
- I can.

19:23.956 --> 19:25.916
I am the son of
Ragnar Lothbrok.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.751
I don't care
about Lagertha.

19:28.919 --> 19:30.587
You are
now a free woman.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.257
Why?

19:33.423 --> 19:37.594
Because
you'll have to be free
in order to marry one of us.

20:16.592 --> 20:19.386
I want to talk to you
about books, Alfred.

20:20.345 --> 20:21.597
Books, Grandfather?

20:21.680 --> 20:24.474
Yes. If you are
going to be King one day,

20:24.725 --> 20:27.728
you need to understand
that books are just

20:27.853 --> 20:30.856
as important as
swords or plowshares.

20:32.649 --> 20:35.944
These are some
works by great writers

20:36.028 --> 20:40.073
that I read and
translated from Latin
as a young man.

20:40.157 --> 20:44.161
And this, this is a work
by Gregory the Great.

20:44.536 --> 20:47.080
Now, he asks
questions such as,

20:47.331 --> 20:52.377
"What kind of man
he is or ought to be,
who is to rule?"

20:52.461 --> 20:53.629
And...

20:56.173 --> 21:01.511
"Can the occupation
of power distract
the mind of the ruler?"

21:08.852 --> 21:11.188
Yes, well,
I can see that
you're bored already.

21:12.356 --> 21:13.607
No, Grandfather.

21:13.899 --> 21:16.526
No? Oh, well, that's good.

21:17.694 --> 21:21.823
Kings should
know how to be bored
and not show it.

21:21.990 --> 21:23.367
Good boy.

21:35.837 --> 21:38.256
To the future.
To the future.

21:42.886 --> 21:44.096
Hmm.

21:44.179 --> 21:45.263
Drink up, drink up!

21:47.808 --> 21:50.560
Here's the thing, Alfred.

21:50.644 --> 21:54.189
Because God
chooses you as King,

21:55.023 --> 21:58.819
you need to be
a teacher to your people.

21:58.902 --> 22:00.237
Do you understand that?

22:00.320 --> 22:01.697
Yes, Grandfather.

22:01.905 --> 22:05.075
Alfred, we can
never call ourselves

22:05.158 --> 22:07.536
any better than
the heathen savages

22:07.619 --> 22:11.373
who attack us if we neglect
the knowledge and the wisdom

22:11.456 --> 22:13.417
that is contained in books.

22:16.795 --> 22:19.172
Come. Let's drink!

22:19.256 --> 22:21.675
These are great matters!

22:25.721 --> 22:27.389
Hmm-mmm.

22:27.889 --> 22:29.433
All of it!

22:33.520 --> 22:37.315
One day, you may be King.

22:39.818 --> 22:42.904
I hope so with all my heart.

22:44.656 --> 22:48.118
And yet I know its burdens.

22:48.201 --> 22:50.370
They're very real,

22:50.662 --> 22:53.957
like forever
dragging a stone up a hill,

22:54.041 --> 22:57.878
only to watch it perpetually
roll back down again.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.883
You need to drink more wine.

23:06.595 --> 23:08.221
I don't want any more,
Grandfather.

23:08.305 --> 23:12.059
Nonsense, nonsense.
You'll join me in one more.

23:20.525 --> 23:24.780
Now, you keep
saying you understand

23:24.988 --> 23:26.907
but you obviously don't.

23:26.990 --> 23:31.870
I've just been drinking water,
while you were drinking
the wine.

23:33.830 --> 23:38.919
Don't ever let
yourself be influenced
by other people.

23:40.670 --> 23:42.714
Especially people like me.

23:43.882 --> 23:48.136
Always, always
think your own thoughts.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.306
And act on them!

23:56.853 --> 23:58.563
Is this the place?

24:01.983 --> 24:04.986
This is the pit
where Ragnar died.

24:05.112 --> 24:08.782
Yes. Thank God.
Just in this place.
Just here.

24:09.116 --> 24:10.867
This is where
the pagan died.

24:15.580 --> 24:17.541
Then it is a sacred place.

24:17.916 --> 24:19.793
How dare you
say such things?

24:19.876 --> 24:21.670
- Are you mad?
- I may be.

24:22.129 --> 24:24.339
But since I love
some of you, I urge you

24:24.464 --> 24:26.633
again to take
heed of my warning.

24:26.716 --> 24:29.094
The sons of Ragnar
are sure to come!

24:31.805 --> 24:33.849
As for you,
sweet sister,

24:33.932 --> 24:37.352
I counsel you,
have a care for
your own soul.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.480
And learn to read.

25:11.011 --> 25:12.804
Our first arrivals, huh?

25:15.807 --> 25:18.351
For the greatest
army ever assembled.

25:18.435 --> 25:21.021
And they will be
our instruments.

25:22.314 --> 25:24.900
Our instruments of wrath.

25:37.662 --> 25:42.375
Are you really going
to allow Lagertha to escape
her punishment, hmm?

25:48.089 --> 25:49.132
No.

25:50.175 --> 25:52.052
We must have revenge.

25:54.346 --> 25:55.388
Yes.

25:55.847 --> 25:57.807
And sooner
rather than later.

26:06.650 --> 26:07.943
Why are we waiting?

26:33.843 --> 26:36.721
My friends,
welcome to Kattegat.

26:37.806 --> 26:40.183
And who might you be?

26:42.018 --> 26:43.645
My name is Ubbe.

26:46.898 --> 26:48.608
Forgive me, Ubbe.

26:48.692 --> 26:51.403
If I'd known,
I would never
have been so rude.

26:52.112 --> 26:54.155
Your father
was a great hero.

26:54.614 --> 26:57.492
Perhaps the greatest
hero of our race.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.119
And that is why we
have answered your

26:59.202 --> 27:02.497
summons and come
to avenge his death.

27:06.251 --> 27:08.545
He was also like our father.

27:09.170 --> 27:11.297
That we have
all lost a father.

27:20.223 --> 27:21.725
Who's the cripple?

27:23.810 --> 27:27.313
His name is Ivar
and he's my brother.

27:29.566 --> 27:32.152
So I would suggest you
stop laughing
at him right now.

27:33.653 --> 27:36.406
Instead, if you want
to stay alive, I would

27:36.489 --> 27:38.199
learn to respect
and fear him.

27:42.454 --> 27:44.205
That would be my advice.

28:06.603 --> 28:08.521
Queen Lagertha.

28:09.105 --> 28:10.106
Who are you?

28:10.190 --> 28:12.233
Earl Jorgensen. From Sweden.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.487
We have come
a long way to see you.

28:15.570 --> 28:17.238
But it is a short
distance to meet

28:17.322 --> 28:19.699
the famous shield-maiden,
Queen Lagertha,

28:20.033 --> 28:22.243
and the sons of
Ragnar Lothbrok.

28:23.453 --> 28:25.371
Ragnar and I
were simple farmers.

28:25.455 --> 28:27.957
I had no idea our
fame had spread so far.

28:28.583 --> 28:30.126
Are you joking?

28:30.210 --> 28:34.756
It is almost
tiresome to hear the poets
talk of all your exploits.

28:35.298 --> 28:37.550
I'm sorry it was tiresome.

28:37.884 --> 28:40.470
Perhaps we should
have done things
a more interesting way.

28:40.637 --> 28:42.806
No, no, no.

28:42.889 --> 28:46.392
That is the fault
of the poets, not you.

28:52.732 --> 28:53.817
And who is this?

28:54.859 --> 28:58.363
This is Torvi,
my son Bjorn's companion.

28:59.823 --> 29:02.450
And this is Astrid,
one of my shield-maidens.

29:03.785 --> 29:06.496
I leave you
in their company.

29:13.002 --> 29:15.255
We'll see.
Really?

29:26.015 --> 29:29.853
You had no right
to free my slaves
without my permission.

29:29.936 --> 29:32.689
I don't remember
you asking permission
to kill my mother.

29:33.356 --> 29:36.776
That's different.
I am Queen now.

29:37.777 --> 29:39.529
I know.

29:40.029 --> 29:42.490
I just don't
know for how long.

29:46.452 --> 29:47.745
Ubbe.

29:49.414 --> 29:51.416
I wanted to tell you.

29:52.292 --> 29:56.212
You look just like
your father looked
when he was a young man.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.425
When I first knew him.

30:54.103 --> 30:56.272
Something's happening.
What?

30:57.607 --> 30:59.025
I don't know.
But something!

31:04.405 --> 31:06.074
Lagertha!

31:09.035 --> 31:10.453
What is happening here?

31:10.536 --> 31:13.122
It's none of your business,
Earl Jorgensen.

32:36.914 --> 32:42.003
If you kill her, my brothers,
you'll have to kill me, too.

32:42.628 --> 32:44.255
Maybe we should.

32:44.922 --> 32:46.549
Shut up.

32:48.176 --> 32:50.261
She killed our mother.

32:51.721 --> 32:53.222
I know.

32:53.890 --> 32:55.183
You want revenge.

32:57.685 --> 32:59.187
So would I.

33:01.731 --> 33:04.859
But more importantly,
we have to avenge our father.

33:09.364 --> 33:10.907
That is why I came back.

33:14.827 --> 33:19.165
And that is what
we are going to do.

34:05.837 --> 34:07.588
So you had your revenge?

34:22.353 --> 34:25.106
Can you see
what we mean, Egil?

34:26.315 --> 34:30.153
Lagertha is building
some serious defenses.

34:30.236 --> 34:34.407
In my opinion,
it doesn't matter
how careful you are.

34:34.490 --> 34:37.827
There will
always be weak places
in the defense.

34:37.910 --> 34:42.832
It just takes a clever person
to figure out where
the weak places are.

34:43.541 --> 34:46.502
And are you
a clever person, Egil?

34:47.003 --> 34:51.215
Well, I'm not beautiful,
am I?

35:36.594 --> 35:38.471
I'm not saying we
shouldn't do it,

35:38.554 --> 35:40.264
but think about it. If we...

35:42.642 --> 35:44.477
Hvitserk!

35:44.894 --> 35:47.813
Ah!

35:48.606 --> 35:49.607
Welcome home, brother.

35:51.901 --> 35:53.861
I hear you freed Margrethe?

35:53.945 --> 35:55.947
You want to marry her.
I'm glad.

35:58.157 --> 36:00.535
Just don't keep
her all to yourself.

36:04.205 --> 36:06.082
It's good to have
you back, brother.

36:09.085 --> 36:10.586
Have you heard
about Mother?

36:12.588 --> 36:13.589
Yes.

36:14.882 --> 36:18.553
Well, you and I, Ubbe,
we jumped under
the ice because of her.

36:20.054 --> 36:22.640
So I don't quite agree
that we should kill
Lagertha because of it.

36:23.766 --> 36:25.309
Ivar thinks we should.

36:25.434 --> 36:27.520
- Ivar's crazy.
- You know that.

36:30.273 --> 36:31.857
Maybe we should wait.

36:31.941 --> 36:33.651
Until we avenge our father.

36:34.193 --> 36:36.070
Someone has to rule Kattegat
when we're away.

36:36.153 --> 36:38.364
And if we kill Lagertha,
we have to kill Bjorn

36:38.447 --> 36:40.575
and I don't
want to do that.

36:41.117 --> 36:42.952
Well, maybe you
couldn't do it anyways.

36:44.787 --> 36:46.289
Would you want to
test me, brother?

36:59.844 --> 37:03.639
How can you go with Ivar,
when he wants to
kill your mother?

37:03.889 --> 37:07.476
We're brothers.
We want to kill Aelle.

37:09.353 --> 37:11.105
Nothing else
matters right now, woman.

37:12.231 --> 37:15.818
I don't understand.
Of course it matters.

37:16.861 --> 37:19.530
It matters to me even
if it doesn't matter to you!

37:19.613 --> 37:20.656
Listen!

37:21.824 --> 37:25.328
I did not come back here
to be told what to do.

37:26.662 --> 37:29.540
Not by you, not by anyone!

37:47.475 --> 37:49.769
Please.
You must eat.

37:52.021 --> 37:54.023
Tanaruz.
Ah, ah.

38:02.323 --> 38:03.866
Hello, Floki.

38:04.241 --> 38:06.577
Helga.
Ivar.

38:16.879 --> 38:19.882
So who's this?

38:20.966 --> 38:22.843
Her name is Tanaruz.

38:23.219 --> 38:25.721
Oh, you brought her back?

38:26.055 --> 38:28.099
She'll make
a good slave, I'm sure.

38:28.182 --> 38:29.433
She is not a slave.

38:31.644 --> 38:33.229
We are adopting her.

38:35.231 --> 38:36.857
She is my child.

38:40.569 --> 38:41.737
Ah.

38:43.948 --> 38:46.409
Well, let's see.

38:48.244 --> 38:50.454
Shh. It's all right.
I won't hurt you.

38:50.704 --> 38:53.165
It's all right.

38:53.249 --> 38:55.251
No. Don't be afraid.

39:02.216 --> 39:04.093
It's very sweet of you
to drag your crippled arse

39:04.176 --> 39:05.594
all the way over
here to see me.

39:06.512 --> 39:09.473
Why do you think I
want anything from you,

39:09.557 --> 39:12.143
you spindly legged,
knock-kneed boat-builder?

39:12.476 --> 39:14.895
It's nice to see how much
you've matured
since I've been away.

39:14.979 --> 39:16.147
Matured?

39:16.564 --> 39:19.275
What, you think I want to be
an old fool like you?

39:19.400 --> 39:22.528
The way you behave,
dear Ivar, you'll never
get the chance.

39:38.210 --> 39:42.423
Actually, might be something
that you can do for me.

39:42.506 --> 39:43.632
Oh.

39:44.758 --> 39:47.428
Now that we're going
to England to fight,

39:47.511 --> 39:49.346
it's about time
I didn't have to crawl about.

39:52.808 --> 39:54.518
Especially
on the battlefield.

39:59.773 --> 40:03.277
I wonder if you
could help me, Floki.

40:11.160 --> 40:12.703
I'll figure something out.

40:24.548 --> 40:26.133
Come on, donkey.

40:27.051 --> 40:28.677
Almost there.

40:44.693 --> 40:45.736
What is it?

40:47.279 --> 40:49.198
It's your legs, Ivar.

40:50.199 --> 40:51.992
It's your wings.

41:15.391 --> 41:16.475
Is it really for me?

42:29.632 --> 42:30.799
Bjorn.

42:31.759 --> 42:33.344
Where's Lagertha?

42:33.427 --> 42:34.887
She has gone to Hedeby.

42:42.770 --> 42:43.854
What for?

42:46.523 --> 42:48.192
She does not
tell me everything.

42:53.614 --> 42:54.907
Nor I.
