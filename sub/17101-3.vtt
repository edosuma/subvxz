I WANNA SEE MYSELF.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.052
I AIN'T DOIN' IT.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.088
NOW, THOSE ARE JUST
BUTTERFLIES, KID.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.456
IT'S ONLY NATURAL
TO BE A BIT NERVOUS.

15:23.556 --> 15:24.757
I LOOK LIKE
A DAMN FOOL.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.626
HELL, KID, YOU LOOK

15:26.726 --> 15:29.029
DOESN'T HE LOOK

15:29.129 --> 15:30.463
SPITTIN' IMAGE.

15:30.563 --> 15:33.266

15:34.534 --> 15:37.537

ST. JOHN CRUSADE AND REVIVAL.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.843
( cheering )

15:43.943 --> 15:46.313
MY NAME IS
BROTHER LAZARUS DUBOIS,

15:46.413 --> 15:47.747
AND I STAND
BEFORE YOU TONIGHT,

15:47.847 --> 15:49.182
AS LIVING TESTIMONY
TO THE POWER,

15:49.282 --> 15:53.353
TO THE GLORY AND TO THE ALMIGHTY
LOVE OF JESUS CHRIST !

15:53.453 --> 15:55.622
( cheering )

15:55.722 --> 15:58.025
PRAISE JESUS.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.227
FOUR YEARS AGO...

16:00.327 --> 16:03.696
I WAS A SALESMAN,
A SINFUL MAN,

16:03.796 --> 16:07.767
FULL OF LUST
AND CHEAP HOOTCH,

16:07.867 --> 16:11.271
SELLING LIGHTNING RODS
DOOR-TO-DOOR,

16:11.371 --> 16:15.875
CHEATIN' GOOD, HONEST FARMERS
OUT OF THEIR HARD EARNED PAY,

16:15.975 --> 16:20.113
SEDUCIN' THEIR WIVES,
SEDUCIN' THEIR DAUGHTERS.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.715
I WAS A DRUNKARD !

16:22.815 --> 16:25.452
I WAS A THIEF
AND I WAS AN ADULTERER !

16:25.552 --> 16:27.887
I WAS A PROFANE MAN

16:27.987 --> 16:32.525
RULED BY PROFANE DESIRES

16:32.625 --> 16:36.663
WITH A ONE-WAY TICKET
TO ETERNAL DAMNATION !

16:38.098 --> 16:39.832
WHEN, IRONICALLY,

16:39.932 --> 16:41.268
I WAS STRUCK DOWN

16:41.368 --> 16:47.107
BY A BOLT OF GOD'S OWN
BLUE FIRE FROM THE SKY.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.344
YOU SAID IF I DIDN'T
FEEL 100% COMFORTABLE,

16:51.444 --> 16:53.680
YOU'D HAVE
SCHMIDT DO IT.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.014
IT'S TOO LATE NOW.

16:55.115 --> 16:59.018
I DON'T EVEN FEEL
50% COMFORTABLE.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.488
YOU LISTEN UP, BOY.

17:01.588 --> 17:04.524
WE GOT THE WHOLE NUT
RIDIN' ON THIS DEAL.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.326
WHAT IF I FOUL UP ?

17:06.426 --> 17:08.695
YOU AIN'T
GONNA FOUL UP.

17:08.795 --> 17:11.164
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS
SIT THERE LOOKING CRYPTIC.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.965
IT'S AUTOMATIC.

17:13.066 --> 17:17.470
WHEN THE MAN THAT YOU CAME
TO SEE HERE TONIGHT

17:17.570 --> 17:22.575
LAID HIS HANDS UPON ME,
AND BROUGHT ME BACK

17:22.675 --> 17:27.114
FROM THE VERITABLE
EDGE OF THE ABYSS !

17:30.550 --> 17:33.753
BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
I GIVE YOU THE RIGHT...

17:33.853 --> 17:35.322
REVEREND BENJAMIN...

17:35.422 --> 17:37.090
ST. JOHN !

17:37.190 --> 17:39.492
( applause )

17:46.633 --> 17:48.835
FOLLOW MY LEAD, BOY,
IT'LL BE ALRIGHT.

17:48.935 --> 17:52.605
REVEREND ST. JOHN !

17:54.441 --> 17:56.643
HALLELUJAH !

17:56.743 --> 17:58.511
THAT WAS
SOME CUTE TRICK.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.147
THE TUXEDO ?

18:00.247 --> 18:02.315
IS HE WEARING IT ?

18:02.415 --> 18:05.352
YOU KNOW GODDAMN
WELL HE IS.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.887
( laughing )

18:07.987 --> 18:09.622
IT IS IMPORTANT,
BROTHERS AND SISTERS,

18:09.722 --> 18:11.124
IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT,

18:11.224 --> 18:12.292
THAT YOU UNDERSTAND,
UNLIKE OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST,

18:12.392 --> 18:14.194
THE REVEREND
ST. JOHN HERE IS

18:14.294 --> 18:17.730
BUT A MORTAL MAN
OF FLESH AND BLOOD.

18:17.830 --> 18:22.034
HIS CONSTITUTION IS SUCH THAT
HE CANNOT LAY HIS HANDS ON

18:22.135 --> 18:24.571
BUT ONE POOR
SOUL A DAY.

18:24.671 --> 18:27.039
TO DO SO OTHERWISE...

18:27.140 --> 18:29.209
COULD PROVE FATAL.

18:29.309 --> 18:32.712
NOW, BROTHERS
AND SISTERS.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.415
IS THERE ANYONE AMONGST YOU
FAITHFUL WHO IS IN SPECIAL NEED

18:35.515 --> 18:38.451
OF CHRIST'S
HEALING POWER ?

18:38.551 --> 18:40.787
WHO IS HERE ?

18:40.887 --> 18:43.089
WHO IS HERE ?

18:43.190 --> 18:44.457

18:49.162 --> 18:51.130

18:51.231 --> 18:52.865

HER BACKBONE'S GONE.

19:50.189 --> 19:54.394

28:24.103 --> 28:26.572
I'M AMAZED HOW MUCH WORK
YOU PUT INTO THE PLACE.

28:26.672 --> 28:29.075
I JUST WISH YOU'D
COME TO US BEFORE.

28:29.175 --> 28:30.910
WELL, BELIEVE ME,

28:31.010 --> 28:33.445
WE'D APPRECIATE ALL THE SUPPORT
YOU CAN LEND IN THE FUTURE.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.514
WE NEED ALL
THE HELP WE CAN GET.

28:35.614 --> 28:38.017
WELL, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHAT I MEANT.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.118
NED... ?

28:39.218 --> 28:42.054
I THINK WHAT VAL'S
TRYING TO SAY IS...

28:42.154 --> 28:46.092
THIS WHOLE BLOCK IS
SLATED FOR DEMOLITION.

28:46.192 --> 28:49.195
DEMOLITION.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.330
WHEN ?

28:51.430 --> 28:52.965
WELL, THAT'S
THE OLD RUB.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.501
CITY PLANNER ORIGINALLY HAD IT
DOWN FOR THE SPRING OF '31.

28:55.601 --> 28:57.403
BUT THAT WAS
BEFORE THE CRASH--

28:57.503 --> 28:59.505
WE TOOK A REAL BEATIN',
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

28:59.605 --> 29:00.940
BUT WE BOUNCED BACK,
SOME.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.441
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
WE WERE GONNA BOUNCE BACK--

29:02.541 --> 29:03.475
GENTLEMEN !

29:03.575 --> 29:05.311
WHEN ?

29:05.411 --> 29:09.148
MIDDLE OF NEXT MONTH.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.685
THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.

29:13.786 --> 29:15.621
OF COURSE IT IS, PADRE,
OF COURSE IT IS.

29:15.721 --> 29:18.124
YOU DIDN'T THINK WE WERE JUST
GONNA THROW YOU OUT, DID YOU ?

29:18.224 --> 29:19.826
IS THAT WHAT
YOU THOUGHT ?

29:19.926 --> 29:23.762
THERE IS A... THERE'S
A BIG OLD EMPTY ROADHOUSE.

29:23.863 --> 29:25.497
ABOUT FIVE MILES
OUTSIDE OF TOWN ?

29:25.597 --> 29:27.299
NOW, IT'S A NICE
PIECE OF LAND.

29:27.399 --> 29:30.036
IT'S OWNED BY WATER
AND POWER, BUT--

29:30.136 --> 29:31.070
NO.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.639
WELL, REVEREND,
DON'T BE SO HASTY.

29:33.739 --> 29:35.174
I'M NOT A FOOL, SIR.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.509
I KNOW THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH "CITY PLANNING".

29:37.609 --> 29:39.445
IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE MIGRANTS.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.113
THE OKIES.

29:41.213 --> 29:41.814
THE GINKS.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.282
THE ROADITES.

29:43.382 --> 29:44.917
IT'S FINE, AS LONG AS
THEY STAY OUTSIDE OF TOWN.

29:45.017 --> 29:47.019
BUT OH, DON'T LET THEM
INSIDE CITY LIMITS, NO.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.655
THEY MIGHT GET A MIND TO STAY
HERE, TRY TO MAKE IT THEIR HOME.

29:49.755 --> 29:51.290
REVEREND, I THINK
YOU'VE GOT US ALL WRONG--

29:51.390 --> 29:52.892
SHUT UP, NED.

29:52.992 --> 29:55.794
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME,
REVEREND.

29:55.895 --> 29:58.630
WE'RE OFFERIN' YOU
A NICE PIECE OF PROPERTY

29:58.730 --> 30:01.067
IN EXCHANGE FOR
THIS CRACKER-BOX.

30:01.167 --> 30:06.305
OR WE CAN EXERCISE IMMINENT
DOMAIN FOR FAIR MARKET VALUE,

30:06.405 --> 30:08.274
WHICH I'D SAY,

30:08.374 --> 30:11.911
LOOKING AT THIS PLACE,
IT'S ABOUT, I DON'T KNOW,

30:12.011 --> 30:14.813
50 BUCKS
AND A DEAD COW'S FART.

30:14.914 --> 30:18.150
SO, WHAT'S
IT GONNA BE ?

30:25.524 --> 30:26.592
EXCUSE ME.

30:26.692 --> 30:28.760
JUSTIN, JUSTIN !

30:28.861 --> 30:31.030
JUSTIN, WAIT !

30:31.130 --> 30:33.632
NOW I KNOW THIS PLACE
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.

30:33.732 --> 30:35.101
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST--

30:35.201 --> 30:36.335
NO.

30:36.435 --> 30:37.369
NO.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.771
THE LORD WAS CLEAR,
HE SPOKE TO ME, IRIS.

30:39.872 --> 30:41.540
HE CHOSE THIS PLACE,
NO OTHER.

30:41.640 --> 30:42.441
BUT JUSTIN--

30:42.541 --> 30:43.910
NO !

30:44.010 --> 30:45.477
( gasping )

30:45.577 --> 30:46.578
VAL ?

30:46.678 --> 30:47.914
VAL, YOU OKAY ?

30:48.014 --> 30:49.415
CAN'T BREATHE...

30:49.515 --> 30:51.517
GET A DOCTOR !

30:51.617 --> 30:53.585
LET'S TAKE HIM
OUTSIDE, BOYS.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.321
EASY, EASY.

30:55.421 --> 30:57.623
WATCH HIS HEAD.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.459
NO, DON'T...

31:00.559 --> 31:03.629
VAL...

31:03.729 --> 31:06.098
( gasping )

31:30.856 --> 31:34.060
( breathing deeply )

31:36.895 --> 31:40.599
( distant singing )

31:42.834 --> 31:44.436
SORRY.

31:44.536 --> 31:47.273
( distant applause )

31:53.946 --> 31:57.383
YEAH, THEY'RE DONE.

31:59.551 --> 32:00.919
WHO NEEDS HELP ?

32:01.020 --> 32:06.058
WHAT KIND OF HELP ?

32:06.158 --> 32:08.594
OH, SO NOW
I'M HIS CHAUFFEUR ?

32:08.694 --> 32:10.496

32:21.440 --> 32:25.411

32:25.511 --> 32:28.014
I'LL GET THE KEYS.

32:40.192 --> 32:44.030
SO WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT
ABOUT THIS MRS. DONOVAN ?

32:45.531 --> 32:46.865
IT'S PERSONAL.

32:46.965 --> 32:50.102
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
PERSONAL ?

32:52.504 --> 32:55.441
IT'S FAMILY BUSINESS.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.652
( brakes squealing )

33:09.021 --> 33:10.056
( music )

33:10.156 --> 33:13.992
* ... LET ME BE LONELY...

33:19.131 --> 33:22.168
* ... I'D RATHER BE LONELY...

33:36.848 --> 33:37.916
YES ?

33:38.016 --> 33:39.551

33:39.651 --> 33:44.090
WELL, I'M SORRY, SON,

36:32.591 --> 36:35.193
YOU MIGHT NOT
SEE IT AS A GIFT.

36:35.294 --> 36:39.431
