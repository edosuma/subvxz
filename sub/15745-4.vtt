01:51.360 --> 01:52.530

02:00.540 --> 02:05.580
RRRR! NEED MORE FIREPOWER.

02:05.610 --> 02:08.250
YAH URRH!

02:23.330 --> 02:26.800
HEY, UH, A CERTAIN SOMEONE
SEEMS AWOL.

02:26.830 --> 02:29.230
ANYONE SEEN THE DUCKMEISTER?

02:35.610 --> 02:37.810
II'LL RESCUE YOU.

02:41.910 --> 02:46.350
OH, MISTY RAINES.

02:46.380 --> 02:49.850
INTERVIEW MOI?

02:49.890 --> 02:51.920
I ACCEPT.

03:00.330 --> 03:03.600
ANY IDEA WHO'S USING US
FOR TARGET PRACTICE?

03:03.630 --> 03:09.010
ALWAYS LIKE TO KNOW WHO'S TRYING
TO BLOW US TO SMITHEREENS.

03:09.040 --> 03:12.710
HEY, WOULD YOU MIND
KEEPING IT DOWN?

03:12.740 --> 03:15.480
AN ACTION HERO NEEDS
HIS BEAUTY SLEEP,

03:15.510 --> 03:18.280
NOT SO MUCH FOR ME,
BUT FOR MY FANS.

03:23.720 --> 03:27.760
BY THE TIME ZODAVIA
REACHES THE LOONATICS,

03:27.790 --> 03:30.460
THERE WON'T BE ANYONE TO REACH.

03:30.490 --> 03:32.900
ALL'S GOING AS PLANNED.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.750
CURSES!

05:41.190 --> 05:46.030
OK, LEX,
LET'S FOCUS OUR FIREPOWER
AND TAKE OUT THIS TIN CAN.

05:58.110 --> 06:02.780
UNH! AAH!

06:02.810 --> 06:06.720
NO ONE BEATS SYLTH VESTER.

06:06.750 --> 06:09.150
AT LEAST, NOT TWICE IN A ROW.

06:10.750 --> 06:12.990
WHAT WAS THAT?

06:13.020 --> 06:14.860
UH, IT WAS NOTHIN'.

06:14.890 --> 06:17.790
UH, JUST A MINOR BUMP
IN THE ROAD.

06:17.830 --> 06:22.600
DON'T TELL ME IT WAS NOTHING
WHEN I HEARD SOMETHING.

06:22.630 --> 06:26.200
KKKKT. SORRY, BOSS,
BUT I'M LOSING YA.

06:26.240 --> 06:30.110
MUST BE SOLAR FLARES. KKKKT.

06:30.140 --> 06:34.080
WORKS EVERY TIME.

06:34.110 --> 06:36.850
IF I WAS THERE,
I'D KICK YOU

06:36.880 --> 06:41.550
WHERE YOU DO YOUR THINKING
AND SITTING.

06:41.590 --> 06:43.990
OOPS. WRONG SWITCH.

06:50.490 --> 06:56.200
Zodavia: LOONATICS,
I HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT
ASSIGNMENT FOR YOU.

06:56.230 --> 06:59.000
I AM QUEEN GRANNICUS
FROM PLANET BLANK,

06:59.040 --> 07:01.610
DEEP IN
THE MERRIEMELODIE GALAXY.

07:01.640 --> 07:06.480
WE'RE ABOUT TO BE ATTACKED AND
SO DESPERATELY NEED YOUR HELP.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.110
THE ONLY WAY
TO STOP THE INVASION

07:08.140 --> 07:11.650
IS FOR THE RIGHTFUL HEIR
TO TAKE THE THRONE.

07:13.150 --> 07:15.650
SO WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH US?

07:15.690 --> 07:19.890
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET
THE HEIR TO THE THRONE.

07:19.920 --> 07:23.660
PRESENTING THE ROYAL TWEETUMS.

07:24.930 --> 07:27.900
AHEM. ROYAL TWEETUMS.

07:34.940 --> 07:39.080
WHERE? ALL I SEE IS
SOME SCRAWNYLOOKING BIRD.

07:39.110 --> 07:42.780
THIS IS THE HEIR
TO THE THRONE.

07:42.810 --> 07:46.720
I'M ONLY 3 1/2 PARSECS OLD.

07:46.750 --> 07:50.090
WELL, ROYALTY ISN'T
WHAT IT USED TO BE.

07:50.120 --> 07:52.560
I HAVE A HUNCH
THAT OUR FEATHERED FRIEND

07:52.590 --> 07:56.060
HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH OUR RECENT RUDE AWAKENING.

07:56.090 --> 08:01.530
THERE ARE FORCES THAT
DO NOT WANT TWEETUMS
TO REACH PLANET BLANK.

08:01.570 --> 08:05.700
OOH, DAWK
AND VEWY MEAN FORCES.

08:05.740 --> 08:09.140
SOMEHOW THEY'VE MANAGED
TO TRACK OUR EVERY MOVE.

08:09.170 --> 08:15.310
THAT'S WHY YOU
ARE NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT
THE DESTINATION IS REACHED.

08:15.340 --> 08:18.180
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL

08:18.210 --> 08:22.920
ABOUT ONE PUNY PLANET
RUN BY ONE PUNY PRINCE?

08:22.950 --> 08:25.560
OR SHOULD I SAY PRINCESS?

08:25.590 --> 08:27.620
HEY!

08:27.660 --> 08:30.230
THE LAST TIME BLANK
WAS INVADED,

08:30.260 --> 08:37.330
THE UNIVERSE WAS PLUNGED
INTO AN INTERGALACTIC WAR
THAT LASTED 1,500 YEARS.

08:37.370 --> 08:43.040
HOW COME EVERY TIME
THE UNIVERSE IS PLUNGED INTO
WAR, IT LASTS 1,500 YEARS?

08:43.070 --> 08:46.110
THE ROYAL FAMILY WAS EXILED.

08:46.140 --> 08:50.580
NOW IS THE TIME FOR TWEETUMS
TO RETURN TO THE THRONE

08:50.610 --> 08:52.780
OR RISK ANOTHER WAR.

08:52.820 --> 08:55.790
WE PROUDLY ACCEPT THE MISSION.

08:55.820 --> 08:59.260
OH, GOODY! I WIKE HIM.

08:59.290 --> 09:01.930
YOU, I'M NOT SO SURE.

09:01.960 --> 09:05.290
DUCK, SLAM, AND ME
WILL DROP OFF TWEETUMS
WITH QUEEN GRANNICUS.

09:05.330 --> 09:09.070
LEXI, TECH, AND REV,
STAY HERE AND WATCH OUR BACKS.

09:09.100 --> 09:11.840
WE'LL TAKE OPTIMATUS' OLD SHIP.

09:11.870 --> 09:15.100
BUT THAT BELONGED
TO THE BAD GUYS.

09:15.140 --> 09:18.810
IT STILL GIVES ME THE WWILLIES.

09:18.840 --> 09:23.210
Ace: TECH RETROFITTED IT
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM,
WITH THRUSTERS, BLASTERS,

09:23.250 --> 09:29.620
EVEN A JUICE BAR SERVING
THE FINEST CARROT SMOOTHIE
THIS SIDE OF GEMINI.

09:29.650 --> 09:32.360
A BILLION MILES
FOR A SMOOTHIE.

09:32.390 --> 09:35.020
OH, GOODY.

09:42.670 --> 09:45.030
Ace: WE'LL BE RUNNIN'
A SKELETON CREW,

09:45.070 --> 09:48.070
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT EVERYONE
STICKS TO THEIR DUTIES.

09:48.100 --> 09:50.710
NATURALLY I'LL BE THE PILOT.

09:50.740 --> 09:52.640
SLAM WILL BE IN CHARGE

09:52.680 --> 09:55.240
OF THE ENGINES, WEAPONS,
AND THE KITCHEN.

09:57.710 --> 09:59.650
AHH! GREAT.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.320
DRENCHED IN SLAM COOTIES.

10:02.350 --> 10:07.020
AND DUCK WILL WATCH TWEETUMS.

10:07.060 --> 10:08.020
OH, BOY, OH, BOY.

10:10.390 --> 10:13.100
YEAH, YEAH. I HEARD YOU
THE FIRST TIME, NUGGET,

10:13.130 --> 10:16.030
AND IT WASN'T
THAT INTERESTING THEN.

10:19.440 --> 10:23.810
LOOKS LIKE THE SURVIVAL
OF THE UNIVERSE IS WELL IN HAND.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.780
ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS ENJOY THE RIDE.

10:26.810 --> 10:31.410
I'LL BE USING
A HIGHPOWERED PROTECTIVE SHIELD
GENERATED HERE AT HEADQUARTERS

10:31.450 --> 10:35.120
THAT'LL KEEP YOU AND YOUR SHIP
COMPLETELY SAFE.

10:35.150 --> 10:37.050
Rev: IT'S A NANOBASED
MOLECULAR SCREEN

10:37.090 --> 10:39.090
THAT DERIVES ITS ENERGY
FROM SUBATOMIC PARTICLES

10:39.120 --> 10:40.860
THAT COULD BE REDIRECTED
LONG DISTANCES

10:40.890 --> 10:43.130
BY BOUNCING THEM
FROM SATELLITE TO SATELLITE

10:43.160 --> 10:45.430
AND THEN RECONSTITUTED TO THEIR
ORIGINAL MOLECULAR STRUCTURE

10:45.460 --> 10:48.160
SO AS TO CREATE AN INVISIBLE
OUTER LAYER OF PURE PROTOPLASMA

10:48.200 --> 10:50.700
THAT NOT ONLY
PROVIDES PROTECTION, BUT CLOAKS

10:50.730 --> 10:54.270
THE VESSEL'S WHEREABOUTS
FROM ANY OUTSIDE DETECTION

10:54.300 --> 10:57.970
HEY, SLAM,
WHAT'S COOKING IN THE KITCHEN?

11:01.750 --> 11:06.250
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE
WHIPPIN' UP FOR DINNER.

11:06.280 --> 11:08.250
OOPSIE.

11:08.280 --> 11:10.290
COME IN, QUEEN GRANNICUS.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.820
WE'RE CRUISING THROUGH
THE CLAMPETT GALAXY

11:12.860 --> 11:15.420
WITH AN E.T.A. OF 7 1/2 HOURS,

11:15.460 --> 11:18.290
DEPENDING IF WE HAVE
THE SOLAR WINDS AT OUR TAIL.

11:18.330 --> 11:21.160
OH. WELL, HOW VERY NICE.
HAVE A SAFE TRIP,

11:21.200 --> 11:25.500
AND BE SURE TO TAKE CARE
OF MY PRECIOUS TWEETUMS.

11:25.530 --> 11:28.170
HEY, UH, DON'T LOSE
ANY GRAY HAIRS OVER IT.

11:28.200 --> 11:31.310
TWEETUMS COULDN'T BE
IN BETTER HANDS.

11:31.340 --> 11:33.840
* I'M SITTIN'
IN MY WITTLE TUB *

11:33.880 --> 11:36.450
* WISKIN' THE GALAXY SO FAST

11:36.480 --> 11:38.880
* HAVIN' MY BOTTOM
SCRUBBITYDUB *

11:38.920 --> 11:42.020
* HOPIN' THIS MOMENT
WILL FOWEVER WAST *

11:42.050 --> 11:43.320
THAT DOES IT!

11:43.350 --> 11:47.360
BATH TIME'S OVER.

11:47.390 --> 11:51.130
AW, BUT YOU WERE DOIN'
A VEWY GOOD JOB,

11:51.160 --> 11:54.130
EVEN IF YOU MISSED A SPOT.

11:54.160 --> 11:56.270
OOP!

11:56.300 --> 12:00.370
THERE. HAPPY?

12:00.400 --> 12:05.340
I THINK I'LL MAKE THIS SONG
MY PWANET'S NATIONAL ANTHEM.

12:05.370 --> 12:07.780
WILL YOU SING IT WITH ME?

12:07.810 --> 12:10.510
FORGET IT. I DON'T DO DUETS.

12:10.550 --> 12:15.050
YOU SHOULDN'T FEEL SAD JUST
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A BAD VOICE.

12:15.080 --> 12:17.520
TURN, PWEASE.

12:17.550 --> 12:21.160
I HAPPEN TO HAVE
A GREAT VOICE.

12:21.190 --> 12:24.090
I JUST DON'T WANNA SING
YOUR STUPID LITTLE SONG.

12:24.130 --> 12:29.400
ONWY ONE OF US IS WOYALTY,
AND ONWY WOYALTY GIVES ORDERS.

12:29.430 --> 12:32.800
YOU CAN EITHER SING
OR CHANGE MY DIAPER.

12:32.840 --> 12:37.470
HAH!
YOU'RE NOT WEARING A DIAPER.

12:37.510 --> 12:39.140
TWUE, BUT I CAN,

12:39.180 --> 12:43.250
AND I'LL MAKE SURE
IT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.950
EHH, YOU'RE DESPICABLE.

12:51.250 --> 12:55.520
SO WHAT ARE THE STUPID LYRICS?

12:55.560 --> 12:58.960
YOU MADE A WISE DECISION,
MR. DUCK.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.900
AND A 1, AND A 2...

13:06.900 --> 13:10.510
EVERYTHING IS
ON COURSE AS I HAD PLANNED.

13:10.540 --> 13:13.540
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

13:13.580 --> 13:15.850
SOON I'LL LAUNCH
MY SURPRISE ATTACK

13:15.880 --> 13:21.380
AND MAKE SURE FEATHER DUSTER
NEVER REACHES PLANET BLANK.

13:21.420 --> 13:25.150
THAT'S WHY I'M A SUPERGENIUS.

13:25.190 --> 13:27.620
MWAH HA HA HA HA HA HA!

13:27.660 --> 13:31.330
MWAH HA HA HA HA HA HA!

13:31.360 --> 13:34.260
MWAH HA HA HA HA HA HA!

13:56.520 --> 14:01.160
THAT'S RIGHT. DUCKS DO MAKE
THE FINEST LEADERS.

14:01.190 --> 14:04.960
MUST BE BECAUSE
OF THEIR RUGGED GOOD LOOKS.

14:04.990 --> 14:08.970
HEY, WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA SHOW ME AROUND THE SHIP?

14:09.000 --> 14:13.640
I BELIEVE THE EXPRESSION
IS WHEN SOMETHING FREEZES OVER.

14:13.670 --> 14:16.570
AH, PWEASE, MR. DUCK.
GIVE ME A TOUR,

14:16.610 --> 14:20.480
AND I WON'T MAKE YOU CWIP
MY BIG, YELLOW TOENAILS.

14:20.510 --> 14:24.110
FORGET IT, MUSTARD STAIN.
YOU'RE STAYIN' PUT

14:24.150 --> 14:27.420
UNTIL WE REACH THAT
RIDICULOUS PLANET OF YOURS,

14:27.450 --> 14:31.250
AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU COULD DO
THAT WILL GET ME TO MOVE.

14:33.120 --> 14:36.590
OOH, WOOK AT ALL
THESE FUN PWACES TO HIDE.

14:36.630 --> 14:38.090
BYE-BYE.

14:38.130 --> 14:40.300
EXCEPT THAT.

14:40.330 --> 14:45.470
HEIR TO THE THRONE. HEIR.
LITTLE HEIR, HELLO. OHH, PLEASE.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.600
HEY, WHAT'S UP, DUCK?

14:47.640 --> 14:49.970
JUST CHECKING IN TO SEE
HOW THINGS ARE GOING.

14:50.010 --> 14:51.570
WELL,
THINGS COULDN'T BE BETTER.

14:51.610 --> 14:54.180
WHY WOULDN'T THEY BE?
YOU THINK I CAN'T TAKE CARE

14:54.210 --> 14:58.580
OF A ONEPINTSIZED YELLOW BIRD?
HA HA HA HA HA HA!

14:58.610 --> 15:02.090
IT'S JUST THAT THE UNIVERSE
WOULD BE PLACED
IN GREAT JEOPARDY

15:02.120 --> 15:07.020
IF ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN
TO THE ROYAL HIGHNESS.

15:07.060 --> 15:11.290
GUH. ROYAL PAIN IN THE BUTT'S
MORE LIKE IT.

15:11.330 --> 15:15.360
THAT YELLOW FUZZ BALL'S GOTTA BE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERES.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.200
OOH. WHAT'S IN HERE?

15:20.370 --> 15:21.500
OH, NO!

15:33.580 --> 15:35.550
OH, GREAT.

15:35.580 --> 15:42.730
THIS IS JUST
WHERE BIRDBREATH WOULD GO.

15:42.760 --> 15:45.130
Tweetums: I WONDER
WHAT'S UP HERE.

15:45.160 --> 15:46.160
EHH.

15:48.700 --> 15:52.770
OOH. THIS PLACE
IS MOST INTERESTING.

15:52.800 --> 15:56.240
WHEN I GET MY HANDS ON YOU,
I'M GONNA

15:56.270 --> 15:58.710
OH, GOODY! A GAME!

15:58.740 --> 16:03.780
NOW SEE IF YOU CAN CATCH ME.

16:05.550 --> 16:08.780
CHEDDARHEAD'S GOTTA BE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

16:08.820 --> 16:11.290
THIS IS FUN.

16:15.620 --> 16:17.630
GOTCHA.

16:17.660 --> 16:19.330
WHAT DO YOU HAVE THERE,
MR. DUCK?

16:19.360 --> 16:21.460
A PRESENT FOR ME?

16:24.200 --> 16:26.470
AHH. AAH!

16:30.370 --> 16:31.570
Duck: MOMMY.

16:31.610 --> 16:35.680
YIII! UHH HAH!

16:37.650 --> 16:40.580
YOU OUGHT TO BE
MORE CAREFUL, MR. DUCK.

16:40.620 --> 16:45.690
SO WHAT GAME WOULD YOU
WIKE TO PWAY NOW?

16:50.390 --> 16:53.660
I DON'T THINK
I WIKE THIS GAME.

16:53.700 --> 16:55.400
TOUGH, TURKEY.

16:55.430 --> 16:57.630
YOU'RE STAYIN' PUT
UNTIL WE REACH YOUR PLANET,

16:57.670 --> 17:00.270
AND JUST TO MAKE SURE...

17:03.710 --> 17:10.110
YOU'RE FUNNY, BUT IT'S NOT
EASY KEEPIN' ME IN ONE PLACE.

17:10.150 --> 17:12.550
YOU CAN FLAP YOUR BEAK
ALL DAY.

17:12.580 --> 17:15.320
THOSE LOCKS ARE IMPENETRABIBBLE.

17:15.350 --> 17:18.420
NOT FOR MY WUCKY PAPER CWIP.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.670
IT LOOKS LIKE ACE
AND THE OTHERS HAVE COMPANY.

17:32.700 --> 17:36.640
THAT CAN'T BE. THEIR FLIGHT
PLAN IS TOTALLY ENCRYPTED,

17:36.670 --> 17:39.540
AND NO ONE KNOWS THE ENCRYPTION
EXCEPT FOR ME.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.710
WELL, HERE'S A THEORY, AND I'M
SAYING IT'S JUST A THEORY,

17:41.740 --> 17:44.310
EVEN THOUGH I THINK
IT'S A PRETTY SOUND THEORY,

17:44.350 --> 17:47.150
THAT MAYBE THERE'S
SOMEONE OUT THERE WHO
BROKE THE ENCRYPTION,

17:47.180 --> 17:49.820
AND THAT SOMEONE IS NOT ONLY
ONE STEP AHEAD OF YOU,
BUT SMARTER THAN YOU.

17:49.850 --> 17:53.660
SMARTER THAN ME? THAT WOULD BE
IMPOSSIBLE,
LIKE DIVIDING BY ZERO.

17:53.690 --> 17:56.530
JUST A THEORY, EVEN THOUGH
I THINK IT'S A PRETTY SOUND

18:00.700 --> 18:04.430
Computer: JAMMING TRANSMISSION.

18:04.470 --> 18:06.300
ACE, COME IN.

18:06.340 --> 18:09.270
COME IN. ACE?
ACE, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

18:09.310 --> 18:11.210
I CAN'T GET THROUGH.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.810
OUR TRANSMISSION
IS BEING JAMMED,

18:12.840 --> 18:15.510
WHICH MEANS THE PROTECTIVE
SHIELD IS ALSO DOWN.

18:15.540 --> 18:20.150
REALLY? MAYBE IT'S BEING
DONE BY THAT SAME PERSON
WHO'S NOT SMARTER THAN YOU.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.290
IT'S PAYBACK TIME.

18:35.260 --> 18:36.730
WHAAH! UNH!

18:36.770 --> 18:38.200
IF IT'S A FIGHT THEY WANT,

18:38.230 --> 18:40.440
IT'S A FIGHT THEY'RE GONNA GET.

18:40.470 --> 18:41.870
RAISE DEFLECTOR SHIELDS.

18:41.900 --> 18:43.510
ARM ALL SYSTEMS.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.550
WE LOST POWER TO WEAPONS.

18:52.580 --> 18:55.720
SWITCH TO AUXILIARY POWER
AND CHANNEL IT STRAIGHT TO ME.

18:55.750 --> 18:59.520
LET'S SEE WHAT SPACE CASE THINKS
OF MY LASER BLASTS.

19:03.860 --> 19:05.690
WHAT

19:14.400 --> 19:16.710
HEIR TO THE THRONE!

19:16.740 --> 19:23.610
OH, BOY. I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO SEE A BIG
SPACE BATTLE CWOSE UP.

19:23.650 --> 19:27.880
UHOH.

19:27.920 --> 19:31.290
YOOHOO! MR. DUCK!

19:31.320 --> 19:32.460
WHAAH!

19:32.490 --> 19:34.490
I'M OVER HERE, MR. DUCK.

19:34.520 --> 19:37.430
NO! NOT THE GARBAGE CHUTE!

19:44.500 --> 19:46.800
HEIR TO THE THRONE?

19:46.840 --> 19:48.570
HEY!

19:48.600 --> 19:51.470
LOOKY WHAT I FOUND.

19:51.510 --> 19:54.980
I WONDER WHERE
THAT WALKING APPETIZER WENT.

19:58.850 --> 20:02.550
TSK TSK TSK TSK.
POOR, POOR MR. DUCK.

20:02.590 --> 20:04.290
SINCE I AM WOYALTY,

20:04.320 --> 20:07.520
IT IS UP TO ME TO SAVE
MY NEW BEST FWIEND.

20:26.710 --> 20:29.550
HEY, DUCK.

20:29.580 --> 20:31.380
TWEETUMS

20:31.410 --> 20:32.950
JUST AS I THOUGHT.

20:32.980 --> 20:38.050
THOSE 2 BIRDS OF A FEATHER
ARE UP TO SOMETHIN'.

20:38.090 --> 20:42.630
IF YOU DON'T GET ON THE RADIO
AND TELL YOUR FRIENDS

20:42.660 --> 20:44.330
TO TURN OVER TWEETUMS,

20:44.360 --> 20:48.860
I'LL SHOW YOU
THE MEANING OF PAIN.

20:48.900 --> 20:51.530
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THERE'S NOTHING
YOU COULD DO TO ME

20:51.570 --> 20:56.610
THAT'S WORSE THAN WHAT THAT
FLEABITTEN WINGED RODENT
HASN'T ALREADY DONE.

20:56.640 --> 21:02.550
YOU, TOO? YOU KNOW,
THE VERY FIRST TIME
I RAN INTO CANARYFACE,

21:02.580 --> 21:08.920
I LOST ALL MY BACK TEETH. LOOK.

21:08.950 --> 21:11.890
EWW. YOU GOT OFF EASY.

21:11.920 --> 21:16.760
I LOST PARTS OF ME
I NEVER EVEN GOT TO USE.

21:16.790 --> 21:19.900
MAYBE NOBODY'S HOME.

21:19.930 --> 21:24.900
OH, IT'S UNWOCKED. NOT TOO SMART
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

21:24.930 --> 21:31.670
I GOT THIS THE TIME
CHEESE BALL LOCKED ME
INSIDE A PARTICLE ACCELERATOR.

21:31.710 --> 21:35.610
NO FEATHERS LEFT FROM
TAKING ON 200 MILLION VOLTS.

21:35.640 --> 21:42.590
NO HAIR LEFT FROM BEING DIPPED
INTO MOLECULAR ACID.

21:42.620 --> 21:46.390
THERE. THE PROTECTIVE SHIELD
IS BACK UP. YOU DID IT.

21:46.420 --> 21:47.620
Both: THANK YOU.

21:47.660 --> 21:49.120
SHE WAS TALKING TO ME.

21:49.160 --> 21:51.360
YOU KNOW, IT'S AWFULLY STRANGE

21:51.390 --> 21:55.360
THAT WHOEVER'S OUT THERE
FOUND US SO EASILY.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.930
UNLESS THEY INTERCEPTED
OUR COMMUNICATIONS.

21:57.970 --> 22:01.100
IMPOSSIBLE. THEY WOULD HAVE
HAD TO HAVE BROKEN MY CODE,

22:01.140 --> 22:03.070
AND NO ONE COULD'VE DONE THAT.

22:03.110 --> 22:05.140
TECH, DO SOME SNOOPIN'

22:05.170 --> 22:08.940
AND TRACE ALL TRANSMISSIONS
DURING THE ATTACK.

22:08.980 --> 22:12.520
FIND OUT WHO WAS YAKKING
WITH THE ENEMY SHIP.

22:12.550 --> 22:14.020
THAT'S JUST A SCRATCH.

22:14.050 --> 22:16.590
I COULD BEAT THAT. LOOK.

22:16.620 --> 22:21.990
OH, YEAH? WELL,
I BET YOU NEVER
GOT SUCKED INTO A BLACK HOLE.

22:24.190 --> 22:28.930
OK, YOU WIN.

22:28.960 --> 22:31.470
DAT DUCK IS SURE
A GOOD FWIEND.

22:31.500 --> 22:33.070
HE'S CONFUSING THE PUDDY TAT

22:33.100 --> 22:38.670
AND MAKING HIM THINK
THAT HE DOESN'T WIKE ME.

22:42.580 --> 22:44.610
PSST, MR. DUCK.

22:44.650 --> 22:46.680
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:46.720 --> 22:52.920
I'M HERE TO WESCUE YOU.

22:57.590 --> 23:00.000
CAN I SINK ANY LOWER?

23:00.030 --> 23:03.730
FREED BY THE MAKINGS
OF A FINGER SANDWICH.

23:03.770 --> 23:06.540
I WAS VEWY WORRIED
ABOUT YOU, MR. DUCK.

23:06.570 --> 23:08.970
YOU SHOULDN'T WANDER OFF
WIKE THAT.

23:11.470 --> 23:14.080
UHOH. I TOUGHT I TAW
A PUDDY TAT.

23:14.110 --> 23:15.740
COME HERE.

23:20.580 --> 23:25.090

23:25.120 --> 23:29.490
OOF. YOU ARE A VEWY, VEWY BAD

23:29.530 --> 23:31.990
TYIN' UP MY FWIEND WIKE THAT.

23:32.030 --> 23:35.660
KISS YOUR FEATHERY BUTT
BYEBYE.

23:35.700 --> 23:36.900
HEH. OH, YEAH?

23:36.930 --> 23:38.970
JUMP ON. I'LL GET US OUTTA HERE.

23:46.980 --> 23:50.150
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE AN ACTION HERO?

23:50.180 --> 23:55.250
YOU GOT ANY BETTER IDEAS?

23:55.280 --> 23:57.750
WHAT'S THIS WED BUTTON FOR?

23:57.790 --> 24:00.060
SUFFERIN' SUCCOTASH!

24:00.090 --> 24:05.230
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T TOUCH THE RED BUTTON!

24:05.260 --> 24:10.600
HE DON'T KNOW ME
VEWY WELL, DO HE?

24:10.630 --> 24:12.740
SUFFERIN' SUCCOTASH.

24:12.770 --> 24:15.070
Computer: SELFDESTRUCT SEQUENCE
ACTIVATED.

24:15.100 --> 24:16.870
HUH?

24:16.910 --> 24:20.210
THE SHIP WILL SELFDESTRUCT
IN 10 SECONDS. 9,

24:20.240 --> 24:23.910
8, 7, 6,

24:23.950 --> 24:27.820
5, 4, 3,

24:27.850 --> 24:29.620
2, 1.

24:32.320 --> 24:35.060
WHEW. THAT WAS CLOSE.

24:35.090 --> 24:36.930
ZERO.

24:36.960 --> 24:38.760
BYE BYE.

24:48.270 --> 24:50.210
Duck: HOW ABOUT THAT?

24:50.240 --> 24:53.280
FOR ONCE, I DIDN'T
GET THE WORST OF IT. YIKES!

24:59.150 --> 25:01.320
POOR, POOR MR. DUCK.

25:01.350 --> 25:03.590
I'LL WESCUE YOU.

25:16.330 --> 25:19.270
Grannicus: AH, LOONATICS,
YOU'VE MADE IT.

25:19.300 --> 25:22.070
DO YOU HAVE THE ROYAL TWEETUMS?

25:22.100 --> 25:22.910
Ace: HERE YOU GO, YOUR HIGHNESS.
SAFELY DELIVERED AS PROMISED.

25:26.140 --> 25:28.910
JUST FOR THAT,
YOU ARE OFF MY COURT.

25:28.940 --> 25:33.980
OH, AND YOU ARE OFF MY PLANET
PERMANENTLY.

25:34.020 --> 25:35.350
FINISH THEM OFF.

25:35.380 --> 25:39.220
MWAH HA HA HA HA HA!
AH HA HA!

25:39.250 --> 25:43.930
TAKE THAT AND THAT AND THAT.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.900
MWAH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!

25:51.670 --> 25:58.670
MWAH HA HA HA HA HA HA.

25:58.710 --> 26:01.180
HMM. NOT EXACTLY
THE SHARPSHOOTER I USED TO BE.
