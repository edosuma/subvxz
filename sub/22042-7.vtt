00:00.469 --> 00:02.084
- [Gordon] Tonight on Hotel Hell.

00:02.084 --> 00:03.785
In a small Connecticut town

00:03.785 --> 00:06.228
a family legacy is on
the brink of disaster.

00:06.228 --> 00:08.776
Do you think this is
what your father wanted?

00:08.776 --> 00:09.645
- Absolutely not.

00:09.645 --> 00:10.513
You're a mean horrible bitch.

00:10.513 --> 00:12.191
- [Gordon] A sibling rivalry has torn

00:12.191 --> 00:13.743
the Hardisty family apart.

00:13.743 --> 00:14.760
Not even love for each other,

00:14.760 --> 00:16.584
it is shocking.

00:16.584 --> 00:17.994
- She wants things done her way.

00:17.994 --> 00:19.626
- I'm in charge of the ship.

00:19.626 --> 00:20.732
- You give a fuck how long? -No my tray

00:20.732 --> 00:23.395
- [Gordon] With the owners
at each other's throats.

00:23.395 --> 00:25.011
- Shut the fuck up!

00:25.011 --> 00:26.502
- [Gordon] This once thriving country in

00:26.502 --> 00:28.548
may have to shut it's doors forever.

00:28.548 --> 00:30.135
Sell it!

00:30.135 --> 00:33.263
(upbeat rock music)

00:55.741 --> 00:58.370
(peaceful music)

00:58.370 --> 00:59.721
- [Gordon] In the heart
of Woodbury, Connecticut

00:59.721 --> 01:01.929
stands the state's oldest inn,

01:01.929 --> 01:03.792
the Curtis House.

01:03.792 --> 01:06.362
Opened in 1736, the 16 bedroom inn

01:06.362 --> 01:08.396
has been owned and run
by the Hardisty family

01:08.396 --> 01:10.360
for nearly 60 years

01:10.360 --> 01:11.682
and is currently being run

01:11.682 --> 01:14.474
by Chris Hardisty and his sister, T.J.

01:14.474 --> 01:19.688
- The Curtis House is
haunted, (door slams) see you.

01:20.822 --> 01:22.658
The rooms will all be
done and the comforters

01:22.658 --> 01:23.857
will be nice and neat and tidy.

01:23.857 --> 01:25.565
And you can go back in five
minutes later and it looks

01:25.565 --> 01:27.952
like somebody rolled across it.

01:27.952 --> 01:29.660
I would walk by a table
and two minutes later

01:29.660 --> 01:31.578
a plate would fly off of it.

01:31.578 --> 01:33.436
I went to light the fireplace and it blew

01:33.436 --> 01:35.608
up on me and I got burns.

01:37.474 --> 01:38.897
There are spirits here.

01:38.897 --> 01:40.918
- [Gordon] But spirits
aren't paying guests

01:40.918 --> 01:44.238
and the Curtis House bedrooms
are empty most nights.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.668
- Right now, I would say we're

01:45.668 --> 01:48.423
about a $100,000 in debt.

01:48.423 --> 01:50.323
My dad recently passed away.

01:50.323 --> 01:51.525
He had a firm belief

01:51.525 --> 01:53.937
that my brother and I
could take over the inn.

01:53.937 --> 01:58.307
It just left me more
determined to succeed.

01:58.307 --> 02:00.014
- [Gordon] Failing to continue
their father's success

02:00.014 --> 02:03.222
with the inn, has destroyed
Chris and T.J.'s relationship.

02:03.222 --> 02:06.021
They hardly ever speak, and
when they do, they fight.

02:06.021 --> 02:07.752
- [Chris] You're a mean, horrible bitch.

02:07.752 --> 02:09.757
If we were married we'd
probably be divorced by now.

02:09.757 --> 02:13.119
You've come off like this
every time, all the time.

02:13.119 --> 02:15.776
She's controlling, she
wants things done her way.

02:15.776 --> 02:17.946
- Because when I sit there and give a rule

02:17.946 --> 02:20.118
I want the rule followed.

02:21.795 --> 02:24.078
My brother frustrates me to
the point where sometimes

02:24.078 --> 02:27.427
I would like to just bop
him over the head to get rid

02:27.427 --> 02:28.931
of some frustrations.

02:28.931 --> 02:31.683
- Another woman that doesn't
listen to a fuckin thing I say.

02:31.683 --> 02:33.355
- [Gordon] Chris and T.J.s his
frustrations with each other

02:33.355 --> 02:38.397
and their failing business have
made the inn hell for staff.

02:38.397 --> 02:41.149
- [T.J.] No, my tray. No, my tray.

02:41.149 --> 02:42.423
- Well, I don't give a fuck!

02:42.423 --> 02:43.292
- They just don't care.

02:43.292 --> 02:44.828
If you look at your boss who doesn't care

02:44.828 --> 02:46.509
why are you gonna care?

02:46.509 --> 02:47.844
- T.J. is not a great leader.

02:47.844 --> 02:49.634
She yells at you, I've
never heard a thank you.

02:49.634 --> 02:50.502
Thank you.

02:50.502 --> 02:52.819
A thank you can go a long ways.

02:52.819 --> 02:54.832
- Chris. He's just a fat, lazy slob.

02:54.832 --> 02:56.042
- [Chris] There's shit everywhere.

02:56.042 --> 02:58.549
- We will get complaints from
the customers, we will have

02:58.549 --> 03:00.794
problems with dishes,
it's just shrugged off.

03:00.794 --> 03:02.615
He doesn't give a crap.

03:02.615 --> 03:05.256
- I've lost respect for
T.J. and Christopher.

03:05.256 --> 03:09.774
We've lost a lot of customers
because of management.

03:10.783 --> 03:12.978
- Since T.J. and Chris both took over,

03:12.978 --> 03:16.173
everything is going downhill.

03:16.173 --> 03:17.419
- [Male Guest] There's
a stain on my pillow.

03:17.419 --> 03:18.476
- [Female Guest] Disgusting.

03:18.476 --> 03:19.676
- [Male Guest] Look at this.

03:19.676 --> 03:22.745
- [Female Guest] Wow,
close the bathroom door.

03:22.745 --> 03:24.137
- [Male Guest] Like a rusted soap holder.

03:24.137 --> 03:26.670
- [Female Guest] Did you
have your tetanus shot?

03:26.670 --> 03:28.252
- Everything sucked.

03:28.252 --> 03:30.748
- Can you give me another
plate without ants on it?

03:30.748 --> 03:34.278
- I would never come here again.

03:34.278 --> 03:36.509
- [Gordon] If things
don't improve and fast

03:36.509 --> 03:39.032
a family legacy could
come to a tragic end.

03:39.032 --> 03:41.498
- The Curtis House is a
huge thing to our family.

03:41.498 --> 03:43.257
We've been here for 59 years.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.429
We've all pretty much grown up here.

03:45.429 --> 03:47.170
- Curtis House is like my second home.

03:47.170 --> 03:48.256
So it has been all these years.

03:48.256 --> 03:51.218
The same with my mother and my aunts.

03:51.218 --> 03:53.148
- If the Curtis House shut down

03:53.148 --> 03:58.101
it would really feel like we'd
lost a part of our family.

04:00.317 --> 04:02.127
- [Gordon] I'm on my
way to the Curtis House,

04:02.127 --> 04:03.990
It's Connecticut's oldest inn.

04:03.990 --> 04:05.861
I'm excited about it because
it's supposed to be one

04:05.861 --> 04:07.893
of New England's historical gems.

04:07.893 --> 04:11.054
There's nothing wrong
with being the oldest.

04:11.054 --> 04:14.111
Just depends how much Botox you've had.

04:14.111 --> 04:14.979
I'm going to be arriving

04:14.979 --> 04:18.163
on a big day for hotels and
restaurants across America.

04:18.163 --> 04:20.344
But there's something
I've got to do first.

04:20.344 --> 04:21.748
(phone ringing)

04:21.748 --> 04:22.750
- [Gordon's Mum] Hello?

04:22.750 --> 04:23.754
- Hi mum.

04:23.754 --> 04:25.034
- [Gordon's Mum] Oh, hi, how are you?

04:25.034 --> 04:26.248
- I'm very well, thank you.

04:26.248 --> 04:28.796
I'm just ringing you to
wish you happy Mother's Day.

04:28.796 --> 04:30.995
- [Gordon's Mum] Oh,
thank you so much Gordon.

04:30.995 --> 04:33.459
And your flowers were
lovely, thank you very much,

04:33.459 --> 04:34.605
very kind of you.

04:34.605 --> 04:36.062
- Well, I'm sorry can't be with you.

04:36.062 --> 04:37.461
- [Gordon's Mum] Thank
you so much for calling,

04:37.461 --> 04:38.688
it's really kind of you.

04:38.688 --> 04:39.657
- Well, listen, have a great day.

04:39.657 --> 04:40.629
Love you lots.

04:40.629 --> 04:41.745
- [Gordon's Mum] Love you, bye.

04:41.745 --> 04:42.613
- Bye now.

04:44.111 --> 04:45.513
Ah, great, here we are

04:45.513 --> 04:47.509
the Curtis House.

04:47.509 --> 04:50.463
Connecticut's oldest inn, lovely.

04:51.936 --> 04:54.242
The Happy Mother's Day
sign looks a bit crap

04:54.242 --> 04:56.953
but I suppose it's the
thought that counts.

04:56.953 --> 04:58.715
Look at this place.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.206
Built before 1736,

05:00.206 --> 05:01.162
incredible.

05:02.927 --> 05:03.796
- Hi there.

05:03.796 --> 05:04.884
- Gordon, nice to see you.

05:04.884 --> 05:06.037
- Oh, welcome to the Curtis House.

05:06.037 --> 05:06.905
- Happy Mother's Day.

05:06.905 --> 05:08.024
- Thank you very much.

05:08.024 --> 05:09.249
- And what's your first name?

05:09.249 --> 05:10.118
- Babe.

05:10.118 --> 05:11.462
- I know you're a babe,
but what's your name?

05:11.462 --> 05:12.331
- Shirley.

05:12.331 --> 05:14.001
- Shirley, nice to see you my darling.

05:14.001 --> 05:15.453
So it's Mother's Day,

05:15.453 --> 05:16.331
the restaurant's booked?

05:16.331 --> 05:17.200
- Yes.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.069
- So it's a big day, right?

05:18.069 --> 05:18.937
- Yes.

05:18.937 --> 05:19.806
- Is the hotel full?

05:19.806 --> 05:20.674
- Not tonight.

05:20.674 --> 05:21.990
- Oh, how many rooms are booked?

05:21.990 --> 05:23.378
- Just one.

05:23.378 --> 05:24.247
- Just one?

05:24.247 --> 05:25.115
- Yeah.

05:25.115 --> 05:25.984
Just me?

05:25.984 --> 05:26.931
- Yes.

05:26.931 --> 05:28.107
- So I'm a little bit early

05:28.107 --> 05:29.925
- Okay, usually check-in is three o'clock.

05:29.925 --> 05:30.794
- Three? Oh.

05:30.794 --> 05:34.087
- There's usually a $10 an hour fee.

05:34.087 --> 05:36.551
- That's what, four hours, so $40 already?

05:36.551 --> 05:37.642
- Yes.

05:37.642 --> 05:39.419
- So I could save a little bit of money

05:39.419 --> 05:41.429
by hanging out and not
actually going into the room?

05:41.429 --> 05:42.618
- Yes.

05:42.618 --> 05:44.688
- So I want to save myself 40 bucks.

05:44.688 --> 05:45.557
- Yes.

05:45.557 --> 05:48.063
- So if I just take a little nap.

05:48.063 --> 05:50.147
- What is he doing?

05:50.147 --> 05:51.583
Mr. Ramsay.

05:51.583 --> 05:52.838
(laughing)

05:52.838 --> 05:55.265
That's really not appropriate.

05:55.265 --> 05:56.916
Mr. Ramsay? Gordon?

05:57.944 --> 05:59.413
(snoring)

05:59.413 --> 06:00.716
This isn't very appropriate.

06:00.716 --> 06:02.201
- Oh, I'm sorry.

06:02.201 --> 06:03.287
- I'm sorry.

06:03.287 --> 06:05.301
- I'm a joking, but it doesn't make sense,

06:05.301 --> 06:07.323
you're charging me $10 a hour.

06:07.323 --> 06:09.883
If I just hang out on the
sofa, get a little blanket,

06:09.883 --> 06:12.038
I can save myself some money.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.048
- Yeah. This rule actually went

06:13.048 --> 06:15.971
into effect about six months
ago, this $10 an hour.

06:15.971 --> 06:19.774
- Oh really? And is it making
a big impact on the business?

06:19.774 --> 06:21.037
- People don't like it.

06:21.037 --> 06:23.790
The bookings in the rooms
have definitely gone downhill.

06:23.790 --> 06:25.363
I think they would be a lot busier if T.J.

06:25.363 --> 06:28.613
didn't have these ridiculous rules.

06:28.613 --> 06:31.353
- Is that right, my details
in here, credit card details?

06:31.353 --> 06:33.549
- Yes. We take a credit card
number to hold the room.

06:33.549 --> 06:35.559
- No, I appreciate that
but why put it in the book?

06:35.559 --> 06:37.175
- That's the house policy,
and if the customer insists,

06:37.175 --> 06:40.806
then we can erase it once they check out.

06:40.806 --> 06:43.236
- I got the credit card
details of everybody.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.278
- I will have to call nine one one.

06:47.215 --> 06:50.549
I don't really have to
call nine one one, do I?

06:50.549 --> 06:54.359
- Babe, see by the time you've
called nine one one, okay,

06:54.359 --> 06:57.767
I've hacked into every
credit card in this book

06:57.767 --> 07:00.758
and made myself a fortune,
so whose policy is this?

07:00.758 --> 07:01.626
It's a bit weird.

07:01.626 --> 07:04.345
- This is a house policy,
like T.J. likes it.

07:04.345 --> 07:05.213
- The owner?

07:05.213 --> 07:06.082
- Yes.

07:06.082 --> 07:07.484
- Would you not think there's
a security breach there?

07:07.484 --> 07:09.578
- Oh, I know, that's why
her policy is no one to look

07:09.578 --> 07:11.768
in this book except the desk person.

07:11.768 --> 07:12.721
- Wow, okay.

07:12.721 --> 07:15.020
- I can't believe you're
gonna be in room 16.

07:15.020 --> 07:16.438
- Why?

07:16.438 --> 07:19.617
- Because room 16 has a
ghost in it. (creepy music)

07:19.617 --> 07:21.848
This woman told me who went to room 16,

07:21.848 --> 07:24.267
she said the ghost was
pulling the blankets

07:24.267 --> 07:26.219
off her all night long.

07:26.219 --> 07:27.469
- And you haven't been drinking sherry?

07:27.469 --> 07:28.337
- No.

07:28.337 --> 07:29.275
- Wow.

07:29.275 --> 07:30.986
- Betty is a ghost at the Curtis House

07:30.986 --> 07:33.168
and people do tell us that she raises

07:33.168 --> 07:34.825
a little bit of havoc with them.

07:34.825 --> 07:37.644
She's definitely there.

07:37.644 --> 07:38.512
- Room 16.

07:43.279 --> 07:46.321
- The haunted room. My goodness me.

07:48.708 --> 07:52.362
What is that on there?
Is that a footprint?

07:52.362 --> 07:54.273
- C'mon, no way.

07:54.273 --> 07:56.229
- So what's all that
big scuff mark on there?

07:56.229 --> 07:59.023
- Yes, it looks like a footprint to me.

07:59.023 --> 08:01.709
- And what's that in there? Dead bugs.

08:01.709 --> 08:05.650
Oh dear, oh geez, look at this one here.

08:05.650 --> 08:07.384
- I give them a list of the
rooms that are coming in,

08:07.384 --> 08:09.616
they're supposed to
thoroughly check the room.

08:09.616 --> 08:13.507
- And what's? Do have
electricity in the house?

08:13.507 --> 08:15.864
- I couldn't believe what
Gordon found in that room.

08:15.864 --> 08:18.036
- And what is this? Oops.

08:21.369 --> 08:23.412
- Nobody just realised or cared.

08:23.412 --> 08:25.084
- How long have you been working here?

08:25.084 --> 08:27.398
- Off and on since about 1965.

08:27.398 --> 08:28.266
- How was it then?

08:28.266 --> 08:29.595
- Busy all the time.

08:29.595 --> 08:31.359
- Well 48 years, that's incredible

08:31.359 --> 08:32.761
so this place means a lot to you?

08:32.761 --> 08:34.174
- Oh yes, my second home.

08:34.174 --> 08:36.203
- Are you connected to
the family in any way?

08:36.203 --> 08:39.852
- T.J.'s parents and
my mother were cousins.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.913
- So it must be sad for
you to see it struggling?

08:42.913 --> 08:44.219
- Yes, definitely.

08:44.219 --> 08:45.210
- And why is it struggling?

08:45.210 --> 08:46.985
- It's the way our two bosses get along.

08:46.985 --> 08:48.552
- And was it different when

08:48.552 --> 08:49.615
T.J. and Chris's parents were running it?

08:49.615 --> 08:52.122
- Oh yeah, much more professional.

08:52.122 --> 08:54.223
- So why do you stay and
why'd you put up with this?

08:54.223 --> 08:56.193
- I take pride in this
place, I like this place.

08:56.193 --> 08:57.062
- I can see that.

08:57.062 --> 08:58.484
- I really do but they don't understand

08:58.484 --> 09:01.226
that the place is really worth it.

09:01.226 --> 09:02.507
I really think T.J. and Chris

09:02.507 --> 09:05.035
are really hurting the business.

09:05.035 --> 09:08.385
Somebody needs to knock
some sense into them.

09:08.385 --> 09:10.801
- First impressions, dismal.

09:10.801 --> 09:13.497
All my credit card details
downstairs in that book

09:13.497 --> 09:14.977
in such a vulnerable position.

09:14.977 --> 09:17.059
One of the busiest weekends
ever for this hotel

09:17.059 --> 09:20.035
with Mother's Day, I'm the
only one staying in the hotel,

09:20.035 --> 09:21.663
that's, that's not good.

09:21.663 --> 09:24.293
Dust everywhere and a
window sill full of bugs.

09:24.293 --> 09:26.306
I don't think we would get
possessed staying here,

09:26.306 --> 09:29.175
I think we're gonna get a disease.

09:29.175 --> 09:33.656
Right, go to the stairs,
have a look. (creepy music)

09:33.656 --> 09:35.046
Hey, let me out!

09:36.212 --> 09:38.764
Honestly, it must be the bloody ghost.

09:38.764 --> 09:40.920
Come on Betty, let me out!

09:40.920 --> 09:42.623
I just wanna get some lunch.

09:42.623 --> 09:45.776
(creepy music)

09:45.776 --> 09:47.198
- I've just arrived at the Curtis House

09:47.198 --> 09:48.592
in Woodbury, Connecticut.

09:48.592 --> 09:50.293
And they've given me a room with a ghost,

09:50.293 --> 09:52.406
and a door lock that doesn't work.

09:52.406 --> 09:53.441
At last!

09:53.441 --> 09:55.407
I'm the only guest in this hotel

09:55.407 --> 09:57.305
despite the fact it's Mother's Day

09:57.305 --> 09:59.006
and the restaurant is fully booked.

09:59.006 --> 10:02.882
What a dreadful missed opportunity.

10:02.882 --> 10:03.750
- Hello.

10:03.750 --> 10:04.619
- Good afternoon.

10:04.619 --> 10:05.487
- How are you?

10:05.487 --> 10:06.399
Welcome to Curtis House, I'm
doing well sir, how about you?

10:06.399 --> 10:07.267
And this is?

10:07.267 --> 10:08.136
- Hi, my name is T.J.

10:08.136 --> 10:09.004
- T.J.?

10:09.004 --> 10:09.873
- Nice to meet you sir.

10:09.873 --> 10:11.175
- The owner? -Yes

10:11.175 --> 10:12.044
- [Both] Nice to see you.

10:12.044 --> 10:12.912
This is my mother.

10:12.912 --> 10:13.928
- Happy Mother's Day.

10:13.928 --> 10:14.797
- Thanks very much.

10:14.797 --> 10:15.665
- It's an absolute honour to meet you,

10:15.665 --> 10:17.197
are you working today?

10:17.197 --> 10:20.187
- I have worked every
holiday and never got paid!

10:20.187 --> 10:23.047
- Ridiculous. You should
be sat having lunch,

10:23.047 --> 10:24.713
enjoying this business.

10:24.713 --> 10:26.317
Shall we go to the table?

10:26.317 --> 10:27.414
- We shall.

10:27.414 --> 10:29.501
- Time for me to see if
the hotels restaurants

10:29.501 --> 10:31.361
is as bad as the bedrooms.

10:31.361 --> 10:32.230
Right.

10:33.245 --> 10:35.236
- Hi, my name's Karen.
I'll be taking care of you.

10:35.236 --> 10:36.104
- Are you connected to the family?

10:36.104 --> 10:38.246
- Yes, I am, aunt T.J.
and uncle Chris's niece.

10:38.246 --> 10:39.834
- Okay, nice,

10:39.834 --> 10:42.991
and just in a nutshell,
what's wrong with the place?

10:42.991 --> 10:46.110
- Now, there's no communication
between my aunt and uncle.

10:46.110 --> 10:47.496
It's gotten a million times worse

10:47.496 --> 10:49.035
since my grandfather passed away.

10:49.035 --> 10:50.124
- It shows, doesn't it?

10:50.124 --> 10:50.992
- Yeah.

10:50.992 --> 10:51.971
I asked Gordon to come here

10:51.971 --> 10:54.130
because my family
desperately needs his help.

10:54.130 --> 10:56.564
They've been struggling for way too long.

10:56.564 --> 10:58.316
They don't know what to do.

10:58.316 --> 10:59.718
We really need his help.

10:59.718 --> 11:02.015
This is the dinner menu.

11:02.015 --> 11:04.936
- Wow. What would you say, crab cakes?

11:04.936 --> 11:07.470
- The crab cakes, yeah, you, yes.

11:07.470 --> 11:09.560
- Ah, don't look at me like
that, that slight hesitation.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.000
- They're hit or miss, they-

11:11.000 --> 11:11.912
- They're hot or miss?

11:11.912 --> 11:12.781
- Yeah.

11:12.781 --> 11:14.076
The crab cakes, what else?

11:14.076 --> 11:15.256
I'll take some calamari.

11:15.256 --> 11:16.125
- Okay.

11:16.125 --> 11:17.226
- And join us for a little
taste of the burger.

11:17.226 --> 11:18.185
- How do you like it cooked?

11:18.185 --> 11:19.054
- Medium rare please.

11:19.054 --> 11:19.922
- Medium rare.

11:19.922 --> 11:20.791
- Thank you.

11:20.791 --> 11:22.268
- You're welcome.

11:23.944 --> 11:25.396
Hey, Mike,

11:25.396 --> 11:28.325
alright, listen, this is Ramsay,

11:28.325 --> 11:31.436
crab cakes, calamari with gorgonzola.,

11:31.436 --> 11:33.887
and he wants the burger, medium rare.

11:33.887 --> 11:34.756
- I am very proud of my food,

11:34.756 --> 11:36.658
whenever I eat other
places, I think we're better

11:36.658 --> 11:38.300
than 90% of them.

11:38.300 --> 11:41.795
- Do we have calamari in the line or no?

11:41.795 --> 11:42.906
- The crab cakes.

11:42.906 --> 11:43.774
- Lovely.

11:44.922 --> 11:48.240
Let's do this together,
would you mind, please?

11:48.240 --> 11:51.976
Come on, you're supposed
to be my wing man.

11:54.687 --> 11:57.840
- I had to swallow, it was not enjoyable.

11:57.840 --> 11:58.709
- Hit or miss? For me that's a miss.

11:58.709 --> 11:59.806
- Yeah, it's not-

11:59.806 --> 12:00.674
- Holy shit.

12:00.674 --> 12:02.320
- These I warned you about (laughing).

12:02.320 --> 12:03.572
- You did warn me about, thank you.

12:03.572 --> 12:05.121
- You're welcome.

12:05.121 --> 12:06.316
How was lunch my darling?

12:06.316 --> 12:09.079
- It wasn't very good.
Everything feels institutional.

12:09.079 --> 12:09.947
- Right.

12:09.947 --> 12:11.251
- You know, like we just
got out of the hospital

12:11.251 --> 12:12.623
and that's the best food we could get.

12:12.623 --> 12:13.491
- I'm sorry,

12:13.491 --> 12:14.530
it's not a nice surprise
on Mother's Day, is it?

12:14.530 --> 12:16.266
- No, it's not.

12:16.266 --> 12:18.374
- Calamari and then I'll have the burger.

12:18.374 --> 12:20.099
- Cocktail sauce, fork and
lemon, I'm gonna get this

12:20.099 --> 12:21.576
for the marinara.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.821
- Pan fried calamari.

12:30.084 --> 12:32.691
- Can you hear any crispiness?

12:34.091 --> 12:37.197
That's limper than my grandads dick.

12:37.197 --> 12:40.556
- Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

12:40.556 --> 12:41.550
- That's disgusting.

12:41.550 --> 12:43.890
- It's awful, it's awful.

12:43.890 --> 12:45.514
- I'll bypass that.

12:45.514 --> 12:46.383
- Okay.

12:46.383 --> 12:47.251
- Thank you.

12:47.251 --> 12:48.894
- You're welcome.

12:48.894 --> 12:50.069
- Yes, what would you like?

12:50.069 --> 12:51.849
- The calamari was mostly greasy.

12:51.849 --> 12:53.572
You know I have to bring this food out.

12:53.572 --> 12:54.915
You know he's gonna critique it

12:54.915 --> 12:57.069
and you know I'm gonna come
right back within one second

12:57.069 --> 12:57.938
because you don't care.

12:57.938 --> 13:01.813
You're just sending me like,
shit on a plate basically.

13:01.813 --> 13:04.941
- All I need is the mushrooms, Mike.

13:06.169 --> 13:07.038
- My burger.

13:07.038 --> 13:07.906
- Your burger.

13:07.906 --> 13:08.775
- Thank you very much.

13:08.775 --> 13:10.947
Jesus. Where's my burger?

13:12.316 --> 13:15.253
What a mess, did you tell
him it's medium rare?

13:15.253 --> 13:16.122
- Mm.

13:17.033 --> 13:18.858
- Oh Jesus, it's raw,

13:19.864 --> 13:21.658
that is not medium rare.

13:21.658 --> 13:23.010
What a shame,

13:23.010 --> 13:24.214
that is dreadful.

13:24.214 --> 13:26.316
- My uncle can't cook
a burger medium rare.

13:26.316 --> 13:27.857
Are you fricking kidding me?

13:27.857 --> 13:29.371
- Can you take me through
and introduce me to the chef?

13:29.371 --> 13:30.240
- Of course.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.139
- Yeah? Thank you. Or your uncle?

13:31.139 --> 13:32.007
- Yep.

13:32.007 --> 13:32.876
- Uncle...Chris?

13:32.876 --> 13:33.744
- Uncle Chris.

13:33.744 --> 13:35.192
- I can't believe how bad my food was.

13:35.192 --> 13:37.723
I've got to see the kitchen
in action for myself.

13:37.723 --> 13:40.555
- Right back here is my cousin Mike.

13:40.555 --> 13:41.424
- Hi Chef.

13:41.424 --> 13:43.029
- This is Chef Ramsay, and Uncle Chris.

13:43.029 --> 13:44.730
- Okay. So T.J.'s little brother?

13:44.730 --> 13:45.985
- [Karen] Yes, baby brother.

13:45.985 --> 13:46.853
- Mike Trudeau.

13:46.853 --> 13:47.722
- Mike, good to see you brother.

13:47.722 --> 13:48.591
- Nice to meet you sir.

13:48.591 --> 13:49.459
- Likewise, and this is?

13:49.459 --> 13:50.328
- Cheyenne

13:50.328 --> 13:51.370
- Cheyenne.

13:59.788 --> 14:04.828
- Fire, yeah, mushroom wrap,
one all day and a prima vera.

14:12.738 --> 14:13.886
- [Gordon] You okay?

14:13.886 --> 14:14.754
- Am I okay?

14:14.754 --> 14:15.833
- Yeah, I've been here 10 minutes,

14:15.833 --> 14:20.352
I'm amazed, none of you
even asked me how lunch was.

14:26.788 --> 14:28.504
What's most shocking isn't the food

14:28.504 --> 14:31.652
or that they have zero interest
in my experience as a diner.

14:31.652 --> 14:32.521
It's the fact that Chris

14:32.521 --> 14:35.314
and his sister don't
exchange a single word.

14:35.314 --> 14:38.283
They wouldn't even look at each other.

14:38.283 --> 14:42.346
You could cut the atmosphere
in here with a knife.

14:42.346 --> 14:43.215
Wow.

14:43.215 --> 14:44.793
This guy must really hate mothers,

14:44.793 --> 14:46.680
the way he's treating these dishes.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.694
You put food on a plate
like you're slopping it.

14:48.694 --> 14:51.898
Can I borrow that cloth a minute?

14:51.898 --> 14:54.591
You're wiping plates with this.

14:56.506 --> 14:57.810
You don't care.

14:59.503 --> 15:02.105
- I don't know about that.

15:02.105 --> 15:04.372
To say that and not know me at all

15:04.372 --> 15:06.892
doesn't have any foundation.

15:09.752 --> 15:12.873
- Is anything cooked to order here?

15:12.873 --> 15:14.654
- French fries, salads.

15:14.654 --> 15:17.856
- French fries and salads, shit.

15:17.856 --> 15:21.030
20 fucking dollars a head for that.

15:21.030 --> 15:23.177
Chris doesn't seem like
an owner or a chef.

15:23.177 --> 15:25.544
He isn't even cooking, he's
just heating things up.

15:25.544 --> 15:28.288
Chris, have you got two seconds please?

15:28.288 --> 15:30.162
Here's where I'm getting frustrated.

15:30.162 --> 15:31.938
You own the place,

15:31.938 --> 15:35.122
you cook like you hate the place.

15:35.122 --> 15:37.903
C'mon Chris, talk to me, please.

15:39.710 --> 15:41.016
If you're not gonna talk to me,

15:41.016 --> 15:43.812
then I'm wasting my time here.

15:43.812 --> 15:45.290
What's the point?

15:48.422 --> 15:50.298
- The Curtis House in
Woodbury, Connecticut

15:50.298 --> 15:53.056
is falling apart because
owners, Chris and T.J.

15:53.056 --> 15:54.807
won't talk to each other

15:54.807 --> 15:57.523
and it's affected the inns
guests as well as the food.

15:57.523 --> 15:58.615
That is dreadful.

15:58.615 --> 16:00.026
I don't know if there're ghost upstairs,

16:00.026 --> 16:03.347
but there's definitely a dead
man walking in the kitchen.

16:03.347 --> 16:07.865
You own the place, you cook
like you hate the place.

16:09.477 --> 16:10.826
This place is a mess.

16:10.826 --> 16:12.256
It's like nobody cares here.

16:12.256 --> 16:13.673
One thing's for sure

16:13.673 --> 16:18.337
it is not happy fucking
families, let me tell you.

16:18.337 --> 16:21.316
Ghost stories and legends
of Southwestern Connecticut.

16:21.316 --> 16:22.338
Wow.

16:22.338 --> 16:24.957
Room 16 is host to a doting female

16:24.957 --> 16:28.655
paying special attention to
male guest staying in the room.

16:28.655 --> 16:33.222
She tucks them into the bed and
may even crawl next to them.

16:33.222 --> 16:37.203
What? At least they've
got one regular guest.

16:37.203 --> 16:38.593
Betty, it's you.

16:39.905 --> 16:41.295
Okay, light out.

16:43.443 --> 16:44.832
Goodnight Betty.

16:47.638 --> 16:49.201
I didn't get a visit from Betty the ghost

16:49.201 --> 16:51.575
but I still had a rough night's sleep.

16:51.575 --> 16:54.963
Whoa, I feel so dusty after last night.

16:55.972 --> 16:58.753
I hope Betty's not watching now.

17:01.934 --> 17:04.193
Shit that's cold. Ah, man.

17:06.787 --> 17:08.973
This inn has been in the Hardisty family

17:08.973 --> 17:10.502
for four generations,
and I can't understand

17:10.502 --> 17:12.809
why T.J. and Chris have no appreciation

17:12.809 --> 17:15.240
for what has been given to them.

17:15.240 --> 17:16.313
I've called a staff meeting

17:16.313 --> 17:18.008
and I'm hoping this will get them talking

17:18.008 --> 17:20.042
before they lose their family heirloom.

17:20.042 --> 17:21.846
I just wanted a quick chat with you all.

17:21.846 --> 17:25.203
My first impressions have not been good

17:25.203 --> 17:26.713
but I struggle to believe

17:26.713 --> 17:28.961
that you two are brother and sister.

17:28.961 --> 17:30.946
It is shocking.

17:30.946 --> 17:34.603
No communication, not even
looking at each other.

17:34.603 --> 17:38.966
Why can't you two at
least talk to each other?

17:38.966 --> 17:41.243
- Get frustrated with some
things and all the time we talk

17:41.243 --> 17:43.250
and talk about doing shit and
we never get anything done.

17:43.250 --> 17:45.458
- Do you think this is
what your father wanted?

17:45.458 --> 17:48.572
- No, it's absolutely not.

17:48.572 --> 17:50.138
- What's wrong with this place?

17:50.138 --> 17:53.589
- I feel like that it's management.

17:53.589 --> 17:55.706
You know, a thank you would
be nice every once in awhile,

17:55.706 --> 17:57.333
you know, that's all I asked for.

17:57.333 --> 18:01.177
I'm more hurt than angry because
I care so much about them.

18:01.177 --> 18:02.893
- You sound like you've been
pushed to breaking point.

18:02.893 --> 18:03.834
- Yeah.

18:03.834 --> 18:06.660
I felt like T.J. and
Christopher don't give a shit.

18:06.660 --> 18:08.724
I don't know how much more I can take.

18:08.724 --> 18:11.197
- Cheyenne, when did the
drive go out of the kitchen?

18:11.197 --> 18:13.631
When did the essence, when did
the word passion disappear?

18:13.631 --> 18:15.316
- I've never seen all
three in that kitchen.

18:15.316 --> 18:16.184
- Ever?

18:16.184 --> 18:17.053
- Ever.

18:17.053 --> 18:19.432
I feel like I am the voice
of truth, everybody else

18:19.432 --> 18:23.403
either one, doesn't care or
two, they just don't see it.

18:23.403 --> 18:26.686
I've been saying since day one
that this kitchen is a joke.

18:26.686 --> 18:29.584
There are no standards
in the kitchen Chef.

18:29.584 --> 18:30.769
- It's depressing.

18:30.769 --> 18:33.697
- Fuck Cheyenne, his opinion
doesn't really matter to me,

18:33.697 --> 18:35.504
never has, never will.

18:35.504 --> 18:37.408
- I watched you in the
kitchen, there was like

18:37.408 --> 18:40.170
you were just hired as an extra.

18:40.170 --> 18:42.079
And T.J. your feud with your brother

18:42.079 --> 18:44.329
is truly getting in the way
of running your business.

18:44.329 --> 18:46.898
The staff are desperate
and you know what hurts?

18:46.898 --> 18:49.921
It's a blessing that
you've got this place.

18:49.921 --> 18:53.146
The potential is huge yet
you walk around and treat it

18:53.146 --> 18:54.710
like it's a curse.

18:56.277 --> 19:01.491
I came to your inn as a guest
and I am not fuckin' happy.

19:01.494 --> 19:05.144
Both of you are sleep walking to disaster.

19:07.313 --> 19:11.742
Go to your office and
at least try to talk.

19:11.742 --> 19:12.610
If you can't talk

19:12.610 --> 19:16.434
you might as well close
the doors right now.

19:17.473 --> 19:18.602
Fucking hell.

19:19.595 --> 19:20.907
- You know, in the 30 years I've been here

19:20.907 --> 19:24.012
I've never had anybody
ever complain like that.

19:24.012 --> 19:25.950
And it makes it tough and
then throw it in my face

19:25.950 --> 19:28.296
it's even harder, you know?

19:38.589 --> 19:39.689
- Hi.

19:39.689 --> 19:40.916
- You okay?

19:40.916 --> 19:41.915
- No.

19:41.915 --> 19:42.783
- What's wrong?

19:42.783 --> 19:46.296
- You really gave me a wake up call

19:46.296 --> 19:48.565
because this place is toxic.

19:48.565 --> 19:50.339
T.J. has issues,

19:50.339 --> 19:51.915
I think she's a control freak.

19:51.915 --> 19:54.404
And you talking to them,
they're standing there

19:54.404 --> 19:58.060
as far as I'm concerned, they
made asses out of themselves.

19:58.060 --> 20:00.119
I'm done here.

20:00.119 --> 20:02.214
I cannot work here no more.

20:02.214 --> 20:03.302
- This is your life, this is your-

20:03.302 --> 20:04.923
- Yeah, and it's destroying me.

20:04.923 --> 20:06.576
- I can see that.

20:06.576 --> 20:09.638
- They don't care about us.

20:09.638 --> 20:12.941
- They need to hear it from you, okay?

20:14.515 --> 20:16.111
I can't believe it's come to this.

20:16.111 --> 20:17.350
- As far as I'm concerned,

20:17.350 --> 20:20.122
T.J. and Christopher,
they're not gonna change.

20:20.122 --> 20:21.772
It's a total shame.

20:25.590 --> 20:27.240
- Hey, how are you?

20:31.206 --> 20:35.729
- I, I can't, I can't work
here anymore, I'm sorry,

20:35.729 --> 20:38.857
it's destroying me, I don't like it.

20:40.759 --> 20:42.985
- You know, I care about
every one of my staff here.

20:42.985 --> 20:45.130
- No, you don't, you make
people feel uncomfortable

20:45.130 --> 20:46.064
and I'm telling you, I don't know

20:46.064 --> 20:48.392
whether anybody else is gonna speak up.

20:48.392 --> 20:49.860
- I'm not saying that I'm perfect

20:49.860 --> 20:51.503
by any means at all either.

20:51.503 --> 20:52.801
But you know, I don't
think that there should be

20:52.801 --> 20:53.990
personal attack.

20:53.990 --> 20:57.187
- This is the way I feel,
whether you guys like it or not

20:57.187 --> 20:59.041
because it's just killing me.

20:59.041 --> 21:02.951
I feel as though there's
no future, I'm done.

21:04.238 --> 21:05.537
- You're giving me a look

21:05.537 --> 21:07.632
like every single bit
of that is justified.

21:07.632 --> 21:09.496
- A lot of the shit
she says is true, T.J.,

21:09.496 --> 21:11.221
nobody wants to fucking talk to to you.

21:11.221 --> 21:13.705
- I am not gonna have her
tell me that I'm this mean,

21:13.705 --> 21:15.684
horrible monster that doesn't
give a shit about anybody.

21:15.684 --> 21:19.464
- Everybody thinks you're a
mean, horrible bitch. Everybody.

21:19.464 --> 21:21.728
I really think you need to
fucking talk to somebody

21:21.728 --> 21:25.503
or do something before you're
in a padded fucking room.

21:25.503 --> 21:26.580
- I disagree.

21:26.580 --> 21:28.661
- The proof is in the pudding.

21:28.661 --> 21:29.654
You're strung out.

21:29.654 --> 21:31.923
You're fucking tweaked right
to the fucking end every day

21:31.923 --> 21:33.755
because you don't have any help.

21:33.755 --> 21:36.477
And then you turn into a
miserable fucking psycho bitch.

21:36.477 --> 21:38.091
- Shut the fuck up,

21:38.091 --> 21:39.551
she didn't know what she
was fucking talking about

21:39.551 --> 21:41.279
and she could drag her fucking ass.

21:41.279 --> 21:43.972
Did I ever say anything to you?

21:46.568 --> 21:48.193
- [Gordon] The broken
relationship between the owners of

21:48.193 --> 21:49.479
Connecticut's Curtis House Inn

21:49.479 --> 21:51.797
has gotten to an all time low.

21:51.797 --> 21:54.491
- Everybody thinks you're
a mean, horrible bitch.

21:54.491 --> 21:56.513
- [Gordon] I ask them to talk
for the first time in months

21:56.513 --> 21:58.206
but all they did was yell at each other.

21:58.206 --> 21:59.857
- Shut the fuck up.

22:01.067 --> 22:02.352
- I'll keep this brief.

22:02.352 --> 22:04.418
I've got to get them to see
if they don't communicate

22:04.418 --> 22:07.410
this inn will shut it's doors.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.330
I don't know what it's
gonna take to wake you up.

22:09.330 --> 22:10.768
You've already lost one of your employees

22:10.768 --> 22:12.667
because you can't get it together.

22:12.667 --> 22:15.331
You're starting to resent each other

22:15.331 --> 22:17.134
and the work you're doing.

22:17.134 --> 22:19.775
- I agree, but I think
it's hard to come to work

22:19.775 --> 22:21.338
knowing the minute you walk in the door,

22:21.338 --> 22:22.600
'til you walk out the back door,

22:22.600 --> 22:24.783
there's a disagreement
in every room you're in.

22:24.783 --> 22:26.579
It used to be that we
talked things through,

22:26.579 --> 22:28.032
we just stopped doing it.

22:28.032 --> 22:31.379
- Just been frustrated,
frustrated every fucking day.

22:31.379 --> 22:32.551
- [T.J.] For three years?

22:32.551 --> 22:33.420
- Yeah.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.970
- You know, if you got so frustrated

22:34.970 --> 22:37.263
with me three years ago that
you just stopped talking,

22:37.263 --> 22:38.480
it's horrible.

22:41.675 --> 22:45.702
- Every fuckin' time we talk
it will turn into an argument,

22:45.702 --> 22:49.066
and I was just avoiding the arguments.

22:49.066 --> 22:51.250
You know, just got fuckin' fed up.

22:51.250 --> 22:54.818
- We're not talking three
months, three years.

22:54.818 --> 22:57.721
When was the last time
either of you stayed here

22:57.721 --> 22:59.983
and see how the guests
experience it through their eyes?

22:59.983 --> 23:01.677
- We've never done it.

23:01.677 --> 23:06.107
- It shows. Can both of
you come with me, please?

23:06.107 --> 23:09.808
There's something in my
room I'd like to show you.

23:09.808 --> 23:11.880
If Chris and T.J. weren't
listening to each other

23:11.880 --> 23:13.436
maybe they'll listen
to the people who could

23:13.436 --> 23:15.695
keep their business alive.

23:16.932 --> 23:20.755
Please, both of you
take a stand over there.

23:22.136 --> 23:23.348
Here we have some guests,

23:23.348 --> 23:28.013
and I think you're gonna find
their feedback invaluable.

23:28.013 --> 23:30.118
Anna, let's start off with you first.

23:30.118 --> 23:31.738
- Just pulling back the comforter

23:31.738 --> 23:34.585
honestly, it looked like the
sheets hadn't been changed

23:34.585 --> 23:36.944
and the chair had, I
picked up a cushion and

23:36.944 --> 23:39.635
there was, for lack of a better word

23:39.635 --> 23:44.217
a skid mark on the
cushion, it was disgusting.

23:44.217 --> 23:46.401
- Ah, the pillows had some stains on 'em,

23:46.401 --> 23:47.699
insects on the window sills,

23:47.699 --> 23:50.226
it looks like the windows
haven't been washed in a while.

23:50.226 --> 23:51.721
- We had a flowers like in here,

23:51.721 --> 23:53.540
they had like an inch of dust on them.

23:53.540 --> 23:54.903
We did not have a bathroom door,

23:54.903 --> 23:58.307
we had a wicker-like divider
and when you tried to pull it

23:58.307 --> 24:00.221
it just kind of falls over.

24:00.221 --> 24:01.924
- Wow

24:01.924 --> 24:02.998
Jump in guys, I mean, you know

24:02.998 --> 24:05.252
these are customers that are paying money.

24:05.252 --> 24:06.201
- It's very disheartening.

24:06.201 --> 24:08.707
I've never got responses like this before

24:08.707 --> 24:10.184
and I wish I had.

24:12.650 --> 24:15.301
- [Gordon] Can I talk to
you about the arrival?

24:15.301 --> 24:16.397
When you arrive,

24:16.397 --> 24:19.674
you hand over your personal
credit card details,

24:19.674 --> 24:21.819
addresses, your cell numbers.

24:21.819 --> 24:27.032
What do you think happens to
your details after you've left?

24:27.403 --> 24:32.270
Because in this book is all
of your credit card details.

24:34.222 --> 24:37.253
- Oh, here we go. This is
it, this is the hammer.

24:37.253 --> 24:40.777
- It is vital information
of your credit card details,

24:40.777 --> 24:45.383
your addresses, your cell
numbers in black and white.

24:46.811 --> 24:49.244
This is a ticking time bomb.

24:51.402 --> 24:52.847
How's that make you feel?

24:52.847 --> 24:54.079
- With everything that's going on nowadays

24:54.079 --> 24:56.516
with the identity theft
and everything like that

24:56.516 --> 24:58.429
I'm not pleased at all about that.

24:58.429 --> 25:01.363
- Would you be so kind just to
leave me here with the owners

25:01.363 --> 25:02.248
for two minutes, please?

25:02.248 --> 25:03.448
I appreciate your
feedback, thank you guys.

25:03.448 --> 25:06.141
- [Guests] Thank you very much.

25:07.238 --> 25:08.215
- [Gordon] Jesus.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.084
- [T.J.] I'm sorry.

25:09.084 --> 25:12.907
- [Gordon] No, no, story
of my fucking life.

25:14.033 --> 25:16.419
- You asked me here to come and help you

25:16.419 --> 25:18.916
but you both need to change your ways.

25:18.916 --> 25:21.886
You won't open up to me and you
won't open up to each other.

25:21.886 --> 25:24.039
Your business is literally
dying because you won't

25:24.039 --> 25:27.155
communicate, it's like you don't care.

25:27.155 --> 25:29.520
I can't even start to move
forward because I'm not

25:29.520 --> 25:32.316
feeling the fucking, the hunger

25:32.316 --> 25:34.431
that both of you want this place to work.

25:34.431 --> 25:37.559
So I'm just saying fuck it, sell it.

25:39.803 --> 25:41.628
I'm going downstairs.

25:42.551 --> 25:43.941
Not again, fuck.

25:47.128 --> 25:49.648
(door slams)

25:52.850 --> 25:57.282
- Oh my gosh, Gordon can't
even find the solution.

25:59.592 --> 26:03.416
It takes two, it takes
two hands to get out.

26:04.406 --> 26:05.274
- I love this place,

26:05.274 --> 26:06.816
I love this place with all my heart

26:06.816 --> 26:08.910
but the way things are going

26:08.910 --> 26:12.473
the revelation is it's just not worth it.

26:13.533 --> 26:15.965
- I'm really struggling to
get through to Chris and T.J.

26:15.965 --> 26:17.277
The person who knows
them better than anyone

26:17.277 --> 26:19.192
is their mother Trudy.

26:19.192 --> 26:22.130
I'm hoping she may help
me to unlock that divide

26:22.130 --> 26:26.908
between them and hopefully
get these two back on track.

26:31.305 --> 26:32.722
Hello, I came to see you this morning

26:32.722 --> 26:34.538
'cause I need your help.

26:34.538 --> 26:36.615
I'm struggling to get through to T.J.

26:36.615 --> 26:39.914
and I'm struggling to
get through to Chris.

26:39.914 --> 26:41.041
They don't communicate,

26:41.041 --> 26:43.213
they don't drive the business forward,

26:43.213 --> 26:44.974
they just bicker and butt heads.

26:44.974 --> 26:46.017
Why is that?

26:47.289 --> 26:50.751
- I don't know, I don't know why.

26:50.751 --> 26:52.678
- How much does that inn mean to you?

26:52.678 --> 26:56.244
I mean, what does it
stand for in your family?

26:56.244 --> 26:58.880
- It stands for the home
work, if nothing else.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.049
- Yeah.

27:00.049 --> 27:03.048
- We all had to work in there.

27:03.048 --> 27:07.456
- You should be reaping the
rewards of the family success

27:07.456 --> 27:09.455
and nearly six decades.

27:10.393 --> 27:12.692
But how would it make
you feel if this business

27:12.692 --> 27:14.604
was sold to a different family now?

27:14.604 --> 27:19.231
I mean all that work of you
and your husband's commitment.

27:19.231 --> 27:22.794
- I don't want another bitter change yet.

27:25.212 --> 27:29.821
I really don't want to see it
go down the street tomorrow.

27:29.821 --> 27:32.550
I wanna see those two
can't come back together

27:32.550 --> 27:35.157
and get it back on their feet.

27:36.211 --> 27:38.757
- I really want to help your family,

27:38.757 --> 27:41.093
and I really want to
keep this business alive

27:41.093 --> 27:42.391
for another 60 years.

27:42.391 --> 27:45.455
So we're gonna have to get
them to talk to each other.

27:45.455 --> 27:48.007
Otherwise the business is doomed.

27:48.007 --> 27:50.404
- Well, you're right.

27:50.404 --> 27:54.294
- I'm gonna need your help, please.

27:54.294 --> 27:55.955
- You got it.

27:55.955 --> 27:58.582
- Thank you, I'll see you back at the inn.

27:58.582 --> 27:59.451
- Okay.

27:59.451 --> 28:02.058
- Okay, thank you my darling.

28:03.171 --> 28:04.440
- Coming up.

28:04.440 --> 28:05.966
- And the two of you to
be able to communicate

28:05.966 --> 28:08.934
as brother and sister
is more important than

28:08.934 --> 28:09.803
even this inn.

28:09.803 --> 28:14.756
- [Gordon] Has change come
too late for the Curtis House?

28:19.297 --> 28:21.067
- [Gordon] The Curtis House
in Woodbury, Connecticut

28:21.067 --> 28:24.961
is sinking because the two
owners won't speak to each other.

28:24.961 --> 28:26.970
And despite the hotel's dire situation

28:26.970 --> 28:29.948
I've been unable to get
through to Chris and T.J.

28:29.948 --> 28:32.500
C'mon Chris, you don't care.

28:32.500 --> 28:35.835
So I went to see their
mum, and I need your help.

28:35.835 --> 28:37.156
- You got it.

28:37.156 --> 28:39.908
- Now, Trudy has organised
a family intervention

28:39.908 --> 28:41.915
to let T.J. and Chris know
how much their fighting

28:41.915 --> 28:44.608
is hurting the inn and
everyone around them.

28:44.608 --> 28:45.477
Hi guys.

28:45.477 --> 28:46.346
- Hi Gordon.

28:46.346 --> 28:49.286
- First of all to you guys,
I appreciate you being here.

28:49.286 --> 28:53.192
Your mum has brought everyone
together just to talk to you

28:53.192 --> 28:56.034
from the bottom of their hearts.

28:56.034 --> 28:58.716
I hope this is gonna open
your eyes because right now

28:58.716 --> 29:00.123
I don't know what will.

29:00.123 --> 29:01.840
Who'd like to go first?

29:01.840 --> 29:04.561
Tess, what have you got to say my darling?

29:04.561 --> 29:07.570
- Mom, I think that you're
spread way too thin.

29:07.570 --> 29:09.065
When you think that the mounting work

29:09.065 --> 29:11.321
is getting to be too much,
you're getting frustrated

29:11.321 --> 29:13.656
and eventually it's bound to spill over.

29:13.656 --> 29:15.576
But I think that for the two of you

29:15.576 --> 29:18.194
to still be able to talk
and communicate as brother

29:18.194 --> 29:22.365
and sister is more important
than even this inn.

29:29.998 --> 29:32.283
- [Gordon] Karen, darling?

29:32.283 --> 29:33.756
- I've sat with both of you,

29:33.756 --> 29:36.726
many times talked about all the problems,

29:36.726 --> 29:38.852
you guys just go back and forth.

29:38.852 --> 29:41.588
There's no resolve, nothing.

29:41.588 --> 29:43.340
You have to get on the same page about it,

29:43.340 --> 29:47.502
it's way too much for
everyone in this place.

29:47.502 --> 29:50.997
It's awful, something has to change.

29:50.997 --> 29:52.662
- [Gordon] Thank you darling.

29:52.662 --> 29:53.727
Babe, darling?

29:53.727 --> 29:55.215
- Okay, T.J. and Chris

29:55.215 --> 29:58.550
I really hope we can all get through this,

29:58.550 --> 30:01.592
I'm getting too emotional, I can't.

30:02.676 --> 30:06.061
- This is so important,
you've been here for 48 years,

30:06.061 --> 30:08.417
you know this place better than anybody.

30:08.417 --> 30:10.366
- The two of you were so
close for so many years,

30:10.366 --> 30:13.043
I know 'cause I was
there and I've seen it.

30:13.043 --> 30:15.193
We used to come to work and do our job

30:15.193 --> 30:18.734
and really enjoy working with each other.

30:18.734 --> 30:22.309
And with both your stubbornness,
you took that all away

30:22.309 --> 30:23.827
since you two stopped speaking,

30:23.827 --> 30:26.558
everything is going downhill.

30:26.558 --> 30:30.916
I want to help you to get back
together like it used to be.

30:30.916 --> 30:33.243
And I know the Curtis
House can be that way again

30:33.243 --> 30:35.676
and only you two can make that happen.

30:35.676 --> 30:38.661
We all wanna be there
for you and help you.

30:38.661 --> 30:41.798
And with a lot of hope and
help and Gordon's expertise

30:41.798 --> 30:44.976
we can get Connecticut's
oldest inn, Curtis House

30:44.976 --> 30:47.322
back to where it should be.

30:48.891 --> 30:51.566
And you two then can be very very proud

30:51.566 --> 30:53.825
of what you accomplished.

30:56.141 --> 30:57.939
- Trudy my darling,

30:57.939 --> 31:00.237
can these two make it work?

31:00.237 --> 31:03.886
- They sure can, they sure can, they have,

31:06.361 --> 31:09.142
and we're behind them 100%.

31:13.221 --> 31:16.175
- They are desperate beyond belief

31:17.463 --> 31:20.331
to help you make this place work.

31:24.018 --> 31:26.190
You both have to step up.

31:28.981 --> 31:31.602
- When he walks through the
door, I have to be the person

31:31.602 --> 31:34.462
that's there for him. That's it.

31:34.462 --> 31:38.723
But I wanted, I want him to be my guy here

31:38.723 --> 31:42.286
and I wanna be the person who he goes to.

31:43.593 --> 31:46.981
- Chris, do you want to make this work?

31:57.744 --> 31:59.570
Chris and T.J.'s family have come together

31:59.570 --> 32:02.444
for a last ditch attempt to
save the Curtis House Inn,

32:02.444 --> 32:04.760
by getting them to talk
to each other again.

32:04.760 --> 32:07.029
Now Chris has to decide
if he'll commit to the inn

32:07.029 --> 32:09.000
or walk away.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.215
Chris, do you want to make this work?

32:17.964 --> 32:19.093
- Absolutely.

32:23.440 --> 32:26.307
(staff clapping)

32:28.738 --> 32:31.880
It just sucks that we've gone this far.

32:31.880 --> 32:34.448
That I must stop being a
jerk especially to my sister.

32:34.448 --> 32:36.322
All right, now I really just
wanna make my mother proud

32:36.322 --> 32:37.346
and my family proud.

32:37.346 --> 32:38.552
It's been a family
establishment all these years

32:38.552 --> 32:41.680
and I have to make them proud again.

32:43.225 --> 32:45.916
- Christopher and I let
everything else get in the middle

32:45.916 --> 32:46.912
of our relationship

32:46.912 --> 32:49.274
but we have to be each other's number one.

32:49.274 --> 32:50.689
You know, family first.

32:50.689 --> 32:51.946
We can do it.

32:51.946 --> 32:54.436
Family united makes a stronger front.

32:54.436 --> 32:55.305
Ready?

32:55.305 --> 32:57.112
- Yes, absolutely.

32:57.112 --> 32:59.828
- It was the first time we
seen that in three years,

32:59.828 --> 33:01.383
it was like we did it.

33:01.383 --> 33:04.250
(staff clapping)

33:06.945 --> 33:08.493
- [Gordon] With Chris and
T.J. ready for change,

33:08.493 --> 33:13.446
my design team has worked all
night to transform the inn.

33:18.521 --> 33:21.936
And now it's time to reveal
the new look to the team.

33:21.936 --> 33:23.316
Welcome to the new Curtis House,

33:23.316 --> 33:25.402
Connecticut's oldest inn

33:26.361 --> 33:28.135
run by an extraordinary family,

33:28.135 --> 33:29.822
providing a warm

33:29.822 --> 33:32.923
and welcoming experience
for other families.

33:32.923 --> 33:33.791
Excited?

33:33.791 --> 33:34.674
- [Babe] I can't wait.

33:34.674 --> 33:35.879
- [Gordon] You're gonna love it.

33:35.879 --> 33:36.790
You ready to go inside?

33:36.790 --> 33:37.734
- Yes we are.

33:37.734 --> 33:40.083
Let's go, follow me, please,

33:40.083 --> 33:41.387
please come in.

33:42.726 --> 33:43.769
- Oh my God.

33:44.914 --> 33:46.217
- Look at this!

33:48.797 --> 33:49.701
- Oh, my God.

33:49.701 --> 33:50.954
- [Babe] That is awesome.

33:50.954 --> 33:53.773
- [Gordon] Welcome to
your amazing new lobby.

33:53.773 --> 33:54.816
The comfort.

33:56.464 --> 34:00.374
- A de-cluttered, very
welcoming, warm space.

34:01.319 --> 34:05.367
Over here we have these
stunning silhouettes,

34:05.367 --> 34:09.623
they are historical
portraits of all your family.

34:12.877 --> 34:16.012
T.J., come here, come over here.

34:16.012 --> 34:16.880
You okay?

34:17.880 --> 34:19.455
Come here.

34:19.455 --> 34:20.973
- The silhouettes of
the family and the staff

34:20.973 --> 34:22.364
it put me over the edge because

34:22.364 --> 34:24.427
this business was built on that.

34:24.427 --> 34:27.405
- [Gordon] You need to
celebrate your family history,

34:27.405 --> 34:29.230
not be trapped by it.

34:30.216 --> 34:32.369
Now one thing that concerned
me on my first arrival

34:32.369 --> 34:35.719
was the check-in and that reservation book

34:35.719 --> 34:38.900
that was gathering all that
sensitive personal data.

34:38.900 --> 34:40.464
Come over, please.

34:41.572 --> 34:43.052
- [Chris] Oh my God, what is that?

34:43.052 --> 34:45.507
- [T.J.] Oh my God, a computer.

34:45.507 --> 34:47.688
- Now we know they didn't
have these in 1754,

34:47.688 --> 34:50.025
but you can, okay.

34:50.025 --> 34:53.726
The credit cards and all the
personal details will be safe.

34:53.726 --> 34:55.940
- We've had that red book for years,

34:55.940 --> 34:58.053
I'm so happy it's gone.

34:58.053 --> 35:00.674
If aunt T.J. brings the red
book back out, I will burn it.

35:00.674 --> 35:03.511
I'll do anything to make sure
we never see that thing again.

35:03.511 --> 35:06.146
- I'd like to take you
upstairs now, to my room.

35:06.146 --> 35:07.015
You ready?

35:07.927 --> 35:08.796
Let's go.

35:10.330 --> 35:12.454
You'll be pleased to know
we've repaired the door handle

35:12.454 --> 35:14.037
so it actually works.

35:14.037 --> 35:15.402
Welcome.

35:15.402 --> 35:16.271
- [Babe] Oh my God.

35:16.271 --> 35:17.488
- [Karen] Wow.

35:19.198 --> 35:21.805
- [Gordon] C'mon, have a look.

35:23.072 --> 35:24.269
- Wow.

35:24.269 --> 35:25.559
Again, steeped in history

35:25.559 --> 35:28.719
but encapsulating that modern elegance.

35:28.719 --> 35:31.159
The panels on the wall, elevate the scope,

35:31.159 --> 35:32.235
the depth of the room.

35:32.235 --> 35:35.884
T.J., Betty the ghost has her own cushion.

35:37.095 --> 35:40.131
- I think Betty's gonna be very
happy with what Gordon did.

35:40.131 --> 35:41.541
I think she's gonna love the fact

35:41.541 --> 35:44.381
that she's become an elegant feature.

35:44.381 --> 35:47.462
- So Babe, I want you to come here please

35:47.462 --> 35:48.851
and stand there.

35:50.518 --> 35:52.844
Now relax, turn around,

35:52.844 --> 35:56.687
I want you look at the
eyes of that picture

35:56.687 --> 35:58.623
and move your head from left to right.

35:58.623 --> 36:00.592
(laughing)

36:00.592 --> 36:05.806
And the eyes move the eyes
follow you around the room.

36:05.947 --> 36:07.950
- Oh my God, the eye portrait.

36:07.950 --> 36:10.822
It was really creepy, but I
would try to stay in there,

36:10.822 --> 36:13.330
I might have another room on backup just

36:13.330 --> 36:14.199
in case I couldn't make
it through the night

36:14.199 --> 36:17.028
but I would definitely give it a try.

36:17.028 --> 36:18.642
- Ready to see another one?

36:18.642 --> 36:20.171
This one you're gonna love,
it's my favourite one.

36:20.171 --> 36:21.040
Let's go.

36:22.449 --> 36:23.317
Up you go.

36:23.317 --> 36:24.186
Oh my God.

36:25.858 --> 36:28.048
- [Gordon] How beautiful is that?

36:28.048 --> 36:29.999
- Wow, oh my God.

36:29.999 --> 36:30.880
- Just gorgeous.

36:30.880 --> 36:33.069
I really feel the changes
are gonna help T.J. and I

36:33.069 --> 36:35.267
get some things back into focus.

36:35.267 --> 36:38.062
My father would definitely
like a lot of the changes,

36:38.062 --> 36:39.771
I wish he was here to see it.

36:39.771 --> 36:42.714
Now you won't believe what
I have downstairs for you,

36:42.714 --> 36:43.582
let's go.

36:46.164 --> 36:47.244
- [Gordon] Coming up,

36:47.244 --> 36:49.625
- I give Babe a surprise
she'll never forget.

36:49.625 --> 36:52.188
Ever had a French kiss?

36:52.188 --> 36:54.534
(laughing)

36:57.288 --> 37:00.317
- [Gordon] I've just shown
the family their new lobby

37:00.317 --> 37:01.716
and the new bedrooms.

37:01.716 --> 37:03.436
- [T.J.] Oh, oh my God.

37:03.436 --> 37:05.558
- [Gordon] Now it's time to
show them the new improvements

37:05.558 --> 37:08.274
to the hotel restaurant.

37:08.274 --> 37:11.348
The inn has been in the Hardisty
family for four generations

37:11.348 --> 37:13.084
- [Karen] Wow.

37:13.084 --> 37:13.952
- [Gordon] So I've come up

37:13.952 --> 37:16.520
with a new menu that reflects
the family's history.

37:16.520 --> 37:19.024
The Curtis House Family Favourites.

37:19.024 --> 37:20.461
- [Karen] Oh my God!

37:20.461 --> 37:23.375
- [Gordon] Let's start off
with grandma Trudy's crab cake,

37:23.375 --> 37:25.229
a hit every single time.

37:25.229 --> 37:28.247
T.J.'s grilled salmon
and corn, Johnny cakes.

37:28.247 --> 37:31.343
Chris's countrified pork
chop dipped in buttermilk,

37:31.343 --> 37:33.824
so with Mac and cheese,
gravy and green beans.

37:33.824 --> 37:35.167
You're only allowed it once a week, mind.

37:35.167 --> 37:36.684
(laughing)

37:36.684 --> 37:39.297
And when you're cooking your family's food

37:39.297 --> 37:41.750
it's gonna be so much more
love, so much more care

37:41.750 --> 37:43.195
to what you're serving.

37:43.195 --> 37:45.194
Now, tuck in and enjoy.

37:49.236 --> 37:51.300
- [T.J.] Oh, that sauce is unbelievable.

37:51.300 --> 37:53.817
- I'm really excited to
show off the new menu.

37:53.817 --> 37:54.870
This is a good one.

37:54.870 --> 37:56.056
Finally, now this is something

37:56.056 --> 37:58.528
I can tell people it's
really, really good.

37:58.528 --> 37:59.659
- [Chris] Everything here is delicious.

37:59.659 --> 38:01.178
Very, very, very good.

38:01.178 --> 38:02.374
- It's like a new ball game

38:02.374 --> 38:04.234
- [Chris] A whole new ball game.

38:04.234 --> 38:05.537
- Just like us.

38:06.845 --> 38:08.509
- [Gordon] Tonight is the relaunch

38:08.509 --> 38:10.465
of the new improved Curtis House.

38:10.465 --> 38:11.370
As the guests arrive

38:11.370 --> 38:13.748
there's a new sense of
warmth and welcome from T.J.

38:13.748 --> 38:14.965
and the staff.

38:16.179 --> 38:18.849
- Welcome to the Curtis
House. How are you?

38:18.849 --> 38:21.248
- I love the new work and I
can't wait for our customers

38:21.248 --> 38:23.305
to come in 'cause I
wanna see their reaction.

38:23.305 --> 38:24.173
- [Female Guest] Wow.

38:24.173 --> 38:25.104
- [Male Guest] We've got
our own little fireplace.

38:25.104 --> 38:27.416
I love how has that nice cosy cottage feel

38:27.416 --> 38:28.738
but yet modern.

38:28.738 --> 38:30.828
- This is definitely gonna
get people in the rooms

38:30.828 --> 38:32.899
and we're proud to send them up there.

38:32.899 --> 38:33.767
- Welcome to the Curtis House.

38:33.767 --> 38:34.636
- Thank you

38:34.636 --> 38:37.868
- Let me take you upstairs to your room.

38:37.868 --> 38:38.797
- This is delicious.

38:38.797 --> 38:41.047
- [Gordon] Down in the
restaurant, Chris is taking charge

38:41.047 --> 38:43.975
and putting in the care he
needs to make his diners happy.

38:43.975 --> 38:45.139
- That's really good.

38:45.139 --> 38:47.202
- Crab cakes need to
go in the oven, please.

38:47.202 --> 38:48.781
It feels very good to have
the Hardisty name on the menu,

38:48.781 --> 38:50.203
you know, it's where I should be.

38:50.203 --> 38:51.907
Definitely him giving
me a little more focus

38:51.907 --> 38:54.416
a little more direction and a
little more immediate pride.

38:54.416 --> 38:56.702
- Yeah and use the spoon to
put that on please, thank you.

38:56.702 --> 38:58.613
- [T.J.] C'mon Chris, we good, we good?

38:58.613 --> 39:00.620
- [Gordon] More
importantly, T.J. and Chris

39:00.620 --> 39:02.810
are working together and communicating.

39:02.810 --> 39:03.679
- It that gone?

39:03.679 --> 39:04.547
- Yes.

39:04.547 --> 39:06.132
- And then we got a clam
and a slider coming?

39:06.132 --> 39:07.001
- Yes.

39:07.001 --> 39:08.370
I think my brother's and my attitude

39:08.370 --> 39:09.692
has changed dramatically.

39:09.692 --> 39:10.707
Plating my clams right now.

39:10.707 --> 39:12.531
- [Chris] Plating now, thank you.

39:12.531 --> 39:14.925
- My brother and I are back
to working very well together.

39:14.925 --> 39:15.918
- [Chris] How are we doing Trudy?

39:15.918 --> 39:17.131
- [Trudy] We're doing fine,

39:17.131 --> 39:19.757
I'm getting all kinds
of compliments again.

39:19.757 --> 39:22.389
- [Chris] Oh baby, you're
alright Ma, you're alright.

39:22.389 --> 39:23.702
It's definitely one of the
most important things to me is

39:23.702 --> 39:28.163
seeing my mother and my
sister and my family happy.

39:28.163 --> 39:30.647
- [Gordon] T.J. and Chris
are finally working together

39:30.647 --> 39:33.561
but I have one last thing I need to do

39:33.561 --> 39:35.070
to help turn this business around.

39:35.070 --> 39:36.238
You must be Donna, good to see you.

39:36.238 --> 39:37.281
- Thank you.

39:38.232 --> 39:39.838
- I've asked a paranormal expert

39:39.838 --> 39:44.209
to investigate the
spirits haunting the inn.

39:44.209 --> 39:45.599
- Somebody here?

39:48.822 --> 39:51.342
Camera's acting really funky.

39:53.223 --> 39:56.237
- Boo! (laughing)

39:56.237 --> 39:58.062
- You are officially...

39:59.735 --> 40:03.215
a member of the Haunted Connecticut Tours

40:03.215 --> 40:06.085
and you are now officially haunted.

40:06.085 --> 40:06.981
Congratulations, my darling.

40:06.981 --> 40:08.465
- Thank you, thank you very much.

40:08.465 --> 40:09.654
- Hang that up with pride.

40:09.654 --> 40:11.931
Now that the Curtis House
has certified as haunted

40:11.931 --> 40:14.748
and on the ghost tour, it will
attract even more business

40:14.748 --> 40:17.962
and help this family get out of debt.

40:18.899 --> 40:21.457
Ladies, I'm gonna say goodbye.

40:21.457 --> 40:23.313
- No, but we're not
ready for you to leave.

40:23.313 --> 40:24.727
- No, you just can't leave.

40:24.727 --> 40:25.912
- I know my job is done.

40:25.912 --> 40:27.355
You two have been amazing.

40:27.355 --> 40:30.575
If they stop talking to
each other, call me, please.

40:30.575 --> 40:31.538
- I'm gonna miss you.

40:31.538 --> 40:36.114
- Oh no, c'mon Babe. I'm gonna
miss you too. Little kiss?

40:36.114 --> 40:39.851
(mwah) and (mwah) two. You know
they give you four in Paris?

40:39.851 --> 40:41.654
- (laughing) Yes.

40:41.654 --> 40:43.713
- Have you had a French kiss?

40:43.713 --> 40:46.942
- (laughing) Uh oh!

40:46.942 --> 40:48.119
- Just asking (laughing)

40:48.119 --> 40:50.574
- Gordon did give me
two kisses on my cheek.

40:50.574 --> 40:55.788
Yes, I haven't watched it yet (giggling).

40:56.329 --> 40:59.611
- Okay, my time is done,
I'm gonna leave you.

40:59.611 --> 41:00.796
- Appreciate it, thank you very much.

41:00.796 --> 41:04.918
- Yeah, don't let 60 years
of hard work disappear.

41:04.918 --> 41:05.905
- Absolutely not.

41:05.905 --> 41:09.093
- Promise me you're gonna
continue talking to your sister,

41:09.093 --> 41:12.299
the minute you don't, the place is doomed.

41:12.299 --> 41:14.290
And you have a beautiful,
beautiful inn here.

41:14.290 --> 41:15.182
- Thank you very much.

41:15.182 --> 41:17.615
- I can't wait to come back.

41:19.594 --> 41:21.522
Look after yourself, please.

41:21.522 --> 41:22.813
- Thank you.

41:22.813 --> 41:25.586
Gordon Ramsey, put some life back into us.

41:25.586 --> 41:27.455
- Goodnight Betty. Wow.

41:27.455 --> 41:30.119
- Gordon showed us where
our relationship should be

41:30.119 --> 41:31.892
and will be from this point on.

41:31.892 --> 41:33.768
I'm forever grateful to Gordon Ramsey

41:33.768 --> 41:36.943
for coming in here and
straightening us out.

41:36.943 --> 41:41.896
- I ain't afraid of no ghost. (laughing)

41:48.228 --> 41:50.344
- Since my visit T.J.
and Chris have learned

41:50.344 --> 41:52.607
how important it is to work together.

41:52.607 --> 41:55.629
- Hot roasted chicken, mashed
only, turkey as it comes.

41:55.629 --> 41:57.141
Gordon pulled off something
that I wasn't sure

41:57.141 --> 41:58.854
was going to be able to be mended.

41:58.854 --> 42:00.051
I think I got my best friend back

42:00.051 --> 42:02.446
and he's not going anywhere this time.

42:02.446 --> 42:03.314
- There you go.

42:03.314 --> 42:05.008
It was definitely an
eye opening experience,

42:05.008 --> 42:07.242
it's not a daily grind now.

42:07.242 --> 42:08.744
- [Gordon] Bookings for the hotel are up.

42:08.744 --> 42:11.623
- [Donna] If there's any
spirits present in this room.

42:11.623 --> 42:13.299
- [Gordon] And it's bringing in tourists

42:13.299 --> 42:15.427
who want to get a glimpse
of Betty, the ghost.

42:15.427 --> 42:17.740
- Good evening, welcome
to the Curtis House.

42:17.740 --> 42:18.644
If Gordon didn't come

42:18.644 --> 42:21.239
I think we were pretty much done.

42:21.239 --> 42:23.033
You saved my family and

42:23.033 --> 42:26.509
it feels like he gave us our life back.
