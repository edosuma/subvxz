WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:02.570
Scrub in with The Resident.

00:02.603 --> 00:04.638
This is a business.
It's not a charity.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.574
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:06.607 --> 00:08.542
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.576 --> 00:11.912
9-1-1, Lethal Weapon,
and Empire.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.248
We lost Empire,
but we are still here.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.653
-Previously on The Resident...
-Why the QuoVadis valve?

00:19.687 --> 00:21.922
It would have to take
a great product to get me

00:21.955 --> 00:24.825
-to change my ways.
-BELL: The VNS went perfectly.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.060
-His seizures
have already stopped.
-IRVING: Bradley's coming in

00:26.094 --> 00:28.229
-for a heart valve.
-Cheers.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.497
The website said QuoVadis
is the new protocol

00:29.530 --> 00:30.764
here at Chastain.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.366
KIT:
You don't get to make surprise

00:32.400 --> 00:34.535
unilateral decisions
that affect our patients.

00:34.568 --> 00:35.736
JULIAN:
When you grab the valve,
it helps to...

00:35.769 --> 00:37.438
AUSTIN:
This damn valve is too big.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.173
MINA:
You're holding it upside down,

00:39.207 --> 00:41.742
which is what Julian
was trying to tell you.

00:41.775 --> 00:44.678
I'll help you get your line down
if you give me some pointers

00:44.712 --> 00:46.514
on how to run our clinic.
Dr. Shaw,

00:46.547 --> 00:48.782
-you start tomorrow.
-I start now.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.151
-(knocking on door)
-Coming.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.561
CONRAD:
This'll get you
through tomorrow.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.130
It's a good thing Chastain's
right across the street.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.964
I can't believe
our shipment was delayed.

01:03.997 --> 01:06.900
-I can. How's your dad?
-CONRAD: Crabby.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.737
Which I am embracing, because
it means he's feeling better,

01:09.770 --> 01:11.605
so... look at this place.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.974
I barely recognize it.
Very impressive.

01:14.007 --> 01:16.410
Sheer force of will.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.045
Are we forgetting anything?

01:18.078 --> 01:20.114
Actually, we are.
Where did I put the...

01:20.148 --> 01:22.183
Oh, there it is.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.956
Ah, yes,
the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

01:28.989 --> 01:31.259
REPORTER:
We're here live
at the grand opening

01:31.292 --> 01:33.727
for Chastain Park Memorial's
new community clinic,

01:33.761 --> 01:35.829
where low-income
or uninsured residents can get

01:35.863 --> 01:39.333
-the medical care
they greatly need.
-Guess we're open.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.669
-Yeah!
-REPORTER: This grand opening
marks a new beginning

01:41.702 --> 01:45.139
for those in need
in Atlanta, Georgia.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.641
REPORTER 2:
Lane Hunter was allegedly
giving chemotherapy

01:47.675 --> 01:49.910
to people who didn't
have cancer.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.146
In a dramatic turn of events,
Hunter was found dead

01:52.180 --> 01:55.449
inside her Atlanta hotel room,
where she had been shot.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.451
This morning, investigators

01:57.485 --> 01:59.086
(on TV):
have identified the assailant

01:59.119 --> 02:02.856
as Roger Stanley,
the brother of a former...

02:02.890 --> 02:05.526
BRADLEY:
Thank you so much
for coming to the rescue, man,

02:05.559 --> 02:07.094
I promise I am not one
of those guys that only calls

02:07.127 --> 02:10.030
-when he needs something. Yeah.
-This is your big presentation,

02:10.063 --> 02:12.666
okay? You land QuoVadis
as a client for your firm

02:12.700 --> 02:14.802
and you will be the hottest
medical marketing consultant

02:14.835 --> 02:16.670
-in Atlanta.
-You are right.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.206
I have worked super hard to get
this meeting ever since

02:18.239 --> 02:19.973
my surgery
and I can't blow it now.

02:20.007 --> 02:23.143
Even though the idea of pitching
to Bell gives me the sweats.

02:23.177 --> 02:26.980
Listen, just be yourself, okay?

02:27.014 --> 02:28.782
You are a natural salesman.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.451
But I got to have my props, man.
So please tell me

02:30.484 --> 02:33.687
you can fix this, okay?
No slideshow, no bueno.

02:33.721 --> 02:36.023
It's just a bad cable.

02:36.056 --> 02:38.359
-You got a spare?
-Why would anyone
have two of those?

02:38.392 --> 02:40.461
As it happens, I do.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.162
-Hold on.
-Seriously?

02:42.196 --> 02:44.232
Oh, you rock.
I suck.

02:44.265 --> 02:47.701
All right, so, tonight,
we hang, okay?

02:47.735 --> 02:50.371
Get some pizza, couple of brews,
we'll play some Call of Honor.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.206
I let you win
because we all know

02:52.240 --> 02:53.874
that's where I rock
and you suck.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.444
Hey. Not taking no
for an answer, man.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.413
No pineapple on the pizza, ever.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.482
-That's a deal-breaker.
-Selfish, okay?

03:01.515 --> 03:03.751
But I agree to your terms
because I value this friendship.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.486
But, for now, yeah, I got to go.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.821
So you just come over
whenever. Uh, I should be back

03:07.855 --> 03:09.723
around 5:00
and I'll see you then, man.

03:09.757 --> 03:10.924
-Thank you.
-Bradley.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.627
Yeah. Oh.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.566
(indistinct conversations)

03:18.599 --> 03:21.402
-BELL: I want that suit.
-(laughs)

03:21.435 --> 03:23.837
Five grand and my London tailor
will make it happen.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.206
I'm in.

03:26.240 --> 03:29.343
Oh. Back-to-back
marketing contenders.

03:29.377 --> 03:31.245
This should be interesting.

03:31.279 --> 03:33.247
GORDON:
By the end of the day
we'll have a winning campaign

03:33.281 --> 03:35.449
to make QuoVadis
a household name.

03:35.483 --> 03:38.085
-All we need now is...
-An offshore bank account
to hide all our money.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.887
(Gordon laughs)

03:41.555 --> 03:44.024
The new QuoVadis website
isn't just advertising,

03:44.057 --> 03:46.193
it's an interactive world
built to engage

03:46.226 --> 03:48.362
those people who need
medical devices.

03:48.396 --> 03:50.698
Providing a hybrid
of technical information

03:50.731 --> 03:54.868
and moving testimonials
from real QuoVadis patients,

03:54.902 --> 03:56.904
one visit
to the company website,

03:56.937 --> 03:58.939
and future clients
will be able to ask

03:58.972 --> 04:01.575
for a QuoVadis device by name.

04:01.609 --> 04:04.812
Using search engine marketing,

04:04.845 --> 04:08.215
our ads and educational
materials will dominate...

04:08.248 --> 04:11.285
(exhales) ...with a big push
in social media.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.121
My only question: how fast

04:14.154 --> 04:15.623
can we get it up and running?

04:16.857 --> 04:18.426
I'm sorry. I, uh...

04:18.459 --> 04:20.828
I, uh, I don't feel so well.

04:22.696 --> 04:25.198
-(people gasping)
-Call 911.

04:27.468 --> 04:28.769
No pulse.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.137
WOMAN:
Uh, yes, we have an emergency.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.105
BELL:
Come on.

04:32.139 --> 04:35.175
-WOMAN: The QuoVadis building.
-(siren wailing)

04:46.320 --> 04:47.988
-Dr. Bell, what are you
doing here?
-It's Bradley.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.262
-Go.
-BELL: 32-year-old male.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.830
Witnessed cardiac arrest.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.265
Recent mitral valve replacement
with a history

04:58.298 --> 04:59.967
of ventricular hypertrophy.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.101
ROSC achieved en route,
lost the pulse again.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.169
Last epi two minutes ago.

05:02.202 --> 05:04.538
Okay.
Another large bore IV.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.811
Okay. One, two, three.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.586
(monitor beeping rapidly)

05:20.654 --> 05:22.122
Come on.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.857
BELL:
Still in asystole.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.393
20 minutes
since he's had a pulse.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.827
More bicarb.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.900
Come on.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.369
Pulse and rhythm check.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.045
Another amp of bicarb.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.380
It's Bradley!

05:47.581 --> 05:49.116
Oh, my God.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.152
Another round of epi.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.456
Come on!
Come on!

05:56.690 --> 05:58.225
Hurry!

06:06.266 --> 06:08.769
Come on.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.904
(sniffles)

06:11.905 --> 06:13.073
Okay, okay.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.042
Pulse and rhythm check.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.451
DEVON:
Come on...

06:27.120 --> 06:28.889
How long has he been down?

06:28.922 --> 06:30.390
30 minutes.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.294
I need a portable ultrasound.

06:34.327 --> 06:35.563
Let's go!

06:37.498 --> 06:41.101
Come on.
Come on!

06:49.977 --> 06:51.679
CONRAD:
Hold compressions.

07:08.095 --> 07:11.331
There is no cardiac activity.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.535
Preliminary autopsy results.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.571
I just need to fill out
the death certificate.

08:27.541 --> 08:30.143
Um, don't do anything yet.

08:30.177 --> 08:34.047
I just want to make sure
this conclusion's warranted.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.716
Okay.

08:38.786 --> 08:40.754
GORDON:
The valves didn't fail.

08:40.788 --> 08:43.323
Not a chance.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.925
It's been implanted
hundreds of times

08:44.958 --> 08:46.560
over the last year
with zero complications.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.261
You're telling me
not one single patient...

08:48.295 --> 08:49.930
I'm telling you people
with bad hearts have issues.

08:49.963 --> 08:52.165
None of them
were caused by the valve.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.601
Yeah, look. This is...
(sighs)

08:53.634 --> 08:56.203
I mean, just,
it's irrefutable proof.

08:56.236 --> 09:00.040
The strut in the valve just...

09:00.073 --> 09:02.109
it shattered.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.444
You have to ask yourself
why it shattered.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.446
You're just assuming that
it was a manufacturing error

09:06.479 --> 09:09.449
when it was clearly
damaged during surgery

09:09.482 --> 09:12.185
by Dr. Austin.

09:12.219 --> 09:15.956
You're saying my surgeon
broke the valve in the OR?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.759
Exactly.

09:18.792 --> 09:21.528
The cause...

09:21.561 --> 09:23.731
of Bradley Jenkins' death...

09:25.065 --> 09:26.734
...is operator error.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.807
Doesn't feel real.

09:33.841 --> 09:37.577
Just... Bradley seemed to be
doing so well after his surgery.

09:37.611 --> 09:40.981
He was... happy.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.382
MINA: Early mortality
from valve replacement

09:42.415 --> 09:44.551
has many possible causes.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.087
Embolism,
congestive heart failure.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.989
A defective heart valve.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.259
You think the valve
that the Raptor implanted

09:52.292 --> 09:54.728
-could have killed Bradley?
-Maybe.

09:54.762 --> 09:57.230
His autopsy is being presented
at this morning's M&M.

09:57.264 --> 10:00.167
We will have answers after.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.669
BOLTON:
Mr. Greenspan's case

10:01.702 --> 10:04.271
is an unfortunate example

10:04.304 --> 10:07.808
of the importance
of transparent labeling.

10:07.841 --> 10:11.078
Mr. Greenspan
was given 25 milligrams

10:11.111 --> 10:13.480
-of Olanzapine instead of 2.5...
-How are you doing?

10:13.513 --> 10:15.415
A little nervous.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.917
You and everyone else.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.652
BOLTON:
...presented to prevent...

10:18.686 --> 10:20.187
How's the clinic?

10:20.220 --> 10:21.955
We've seen over 60 patients,

10:21.989 --> 10:23.590
and it's only our third day.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.593
BOLTON:
...we can end labeling errors.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.595
Up next, we have...

10:28.628 --> 10:30.597
the Jenkins case.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.701
-(microphone feedback)
-The Jenkins case

10:33.734 --> 10:35.468
will not be presented today.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.470
Apologies
for the misunderstanding.

10:37.504 --> 10:39.372
-Thank you.
-(people murmuring)

10:39.406 --> 10:42.142
He is up to something.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.311
Clearly.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.545
BOLTON:
Okay, um...

10:45.578 --> 10:48.816
(chuckles)
moving right along.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.858
Are you keeping tabs on me?

10:57.891 --> 11:00.627
Nope. When my dad
was touch and go,

11:00.660 --> 11:02.229
you gave me a great case
I could fix.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.997
I'm returning the favor.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.398
I'm fine.
I don't need anything...

11:05.432 --> 11:07.434
You can thank me later.

11:14.541 --> 11:17.978
Good morning, Marisol.
I'm Dr. Pravesh.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.180
Glad someone's
having a good morning.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.581
To tell you the truth,

11:21.614 --> 11:23.650
this pain has ruined mine.

11:23.683 --> 11:24.985
And my life.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.420
Oh right, and my marriage.

11:27.454 --> 11:30.157
Well, that's what
I would call bad pain.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.225
Mm, you and me both,
Dr. Pravesh.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.827
You and me both.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.829
When did this life-ruining
pain start?

11:35.863 --> 11:38.665
Oh, about six hours ago.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.567
It took six whole hours
to ruin a marriage?

11:40.600 --> 11:42.535
Amateur.
(scoffs)

11:42.569 --> 11:45.072
-I didn't even make it
down the aisle.
-Let's see--

11:45.105 --> 11:47.607
kicked my husband
to the curb about a year ago,

11:47.640 --> 11:49.843
two years of trying
to make it work before that.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.712
Um, I had an ectopic pregnancy,
so my right ovary is...

11:52.746 --> 11:54.614
(blows raspberry)
Dud.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.917
When I eventually
did get pregnant again,

11:56.950 --> 11:59.820
I had a crash C-section.

12:00.888 --> 12:03.056
They saved me,
but we lost our son.

12:05.759 --> 12:08.128
I'm sorry for your loss.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.430
The pain started
shortly after that.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.465
And so did the marital problems.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.934
Did you see a doctor about this?

12:13.967 --> 12:15.235
Many.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.737
And none of them
would listen to me.

12:17.771 --> 12:20.673
I need a doctor
who will believe me.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.778
I believe you.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.579
And I'm gonna figure out
what's going on.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.153
Floyd, how you doing?

12:33.186 --> 12:36.156
Hey, the sun is shining,
it's a beautiful day.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.458
I'm feeling fine.
(coughs)

12:38.491 --> 12:40.894
(hacking coughs)

12:40.928 --> 12:43.630
-That doesn't sound fine.
-(groans)

12:43.663 --> 12:45.732
Dr. Shaw, meet Floyd Washington.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.068
Retired mailman, Vietnam vet

12:48.101 --> 12:51.138
-and awesome grandfather.
-How you doing, doc?

12:51.171 --> 12:53.941
Nice to meet you, Floyd.
What's your name, kid?

12:56.009 --> 12:58.178
Aw, don't mind Aubrey.
She hates attention.

12:58.211 --> 13:01.281
Although the hair and the
piercings might say otherwise.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.883
I'm gonna have
you breathe for me, Floyd.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.219
Deep breath.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.291
Yeah, if it's not anime

13:11.324 --> 13:14.661
or tattoos or AP Biology,

13:14.694 --> 13:16.729
this girl's quiet as a mouse.

13:20.067 --> 13:22.635
-Floyd, do you have
any pain in your leg?
-No, no,

13:22.669 --> 13:24.905
just-just the, uh, cough.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.342
Why don't you change into this
for me, would you, Floyd?

13:29.376 --> 13:31.678
I'm gonna perform a full exam.

13:31.711 --> 13:35.282
Menthol, regular,
filtered, unfiltered?

13:35.315 --> 13:37.284
None of the above.
Quit cold turkey

13:37.317 --> 13:38.551
when Aubrey moved in with me.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.353
Secondhand smoke kills.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.022
Unlike firsthand smoke.

13:43.556 --> 13:46.459
Nurse Nic,
call The Atlanta Journal,

13:46.493 --> 13:49.129
my granddaughter speaks.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.331
All right,
but after your chest X-ray.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.733
We'll be back.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.369
Thanks, Floyd.

13:59.739 --> 14:02.742
Dr. Bell. Fred Harris, new
general counsel for Chastain.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.912
Good to meet you.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.646
The Jenkins family
is pursuing legal action

14:06.679 --> 14:08.081
for the death of their son.

14:08.115 --> 14:11.184
-I spoke to the pathologist...
-The official cause of death

14:11.218 --> 14:13.053
-hasn't been determined.
-No.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.923
Not official, but...
Y... She believes

14:15.956 --> 14:19.659
-the heart valve shattered.
-There's a question as to why.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.428
Mm. The board
won't like that narrative.

14:21.461 --> 14:25.065
Puts our surgeon at fault,
makes Chastain vulnerable. No.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.733
We have to avoid
surgical error at all costs,

14:26.766 --> 14:29.569
and your job is to make sure
that happens.

14:29.602 --> 14:30.938
Quickly.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.305
Do whatever you have to do.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.848
Of course.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.416
What were the results
of the autopsy?

14:43.450 --> 14:44.884
Bradley was our friend.

14:44.918 --> 14:47.120
-We need to know what happened.
-I'm aware of the how important

14:47.154 --> 14:49.256
Bradley was to you
and I'm doing my best...

14:49.289 --> 14:51.091
-What was the cause of death?
-We're conducting

14:51.124 --> 14:52.559
a closed investigation
to determine that.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.027
DEVON:
I was there when he died.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.595
I should be a part
of that investigation.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.965
And I assisted Dr. Austin
on his heart valve surgery.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.300
The investigation
should be transparent.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.569
Done at an open M&M.

15:02.602 --> 15:05.105
I'm trying to protect
Dr. Austin.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.108
DEVON:
So, you're saying

15:08.141 --> 15:09.576
that Bradley died
because Dr. Austin

15:09.609 --> 15:11.411
made a mistake during surgery?

15:11.444 --> 15:14.614
I'm saying that if you don't
want to ruin his career,

15:14.647 --> 15:17.985
you'll stand down
and let me do my job.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.331
I mean, is it possible
that The Raptor...

15:31.364 --> 15:32.765
-No.
-No.

15:32.799 --> 15:35.068
-Anyone can make a mistake.
-Not this.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.337
We need to warn Austin
so he can prepare a defense.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.506
-He won't be thrilled.
-All right,

15:39.539 --> 15:41.808
I'll see you guys later. I have
a GI consult with Marisol.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.076
I don't trust Bell.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.577
Whatever he says,
he's protecting Chastain,

15:44.611 --> 15:46.146
-not Austin.
-(sighs) Yeah.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.148
My guess, the problem
was the QuoVadis valve

15:48.181 --> 15:49.382
and they're blaming him.

15:50.850 --> 15:52.652
You're telling me...

15:52.685 --> 15:55.989
Bell thinks these hands
killed Bradley Jenkins?

16:00.060 --> 16:03.263
You know what I think?

16:03.296 --> 16:05.532
(yells)

16:15.175 --> 16:18.011
That went exactly as I expected.

16:25.252 --> 16:26.486
Dr. Bell.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.855
Just the man I want to see.

16:28.888 --> 16:30.390
I hear you're looking
for a scapegoat.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.792
So I obtained the copy
of the autopsy report

16:32.825 --> 16:35.495
which clearly states
that your valve--

16:35.528 --> 16:37.864
the one Chastain
forced into my OR

16:37.897 --> 16:40.733
due to your little
sweetheart deal-- failed.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.735
Because you made
an error inserting it.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.038
Au contraire, Satan.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.973
You must be Dr. Austin.

16:47.006 --> 16:50.377
-Your arrogance proceeds you.
-This isn't about me, dawg.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.512
This is about your defective
product, which does not

16:52.545 --> 16:54.547
belong on Chastain's shelves.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.649
Your mentor, Abe Benedict,
loves our valves

16:56.683 --> 16:58.418
and all his patients
are alive and well.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.088
Oh yeah? Well, prove it.
Show me your stats.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.256
Right.
I'm guessing no one

17:03.290 --> 17:05.192
tracks long-term outcomes.

17:05.225 --> 17:08.928
My devices-- each one--
are little works of art.

17:08.961 --> 17:11.231
Perfectly designed to make
a failing body better.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.999
But they must be understood.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.834
They must be treated
with respect.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.837
Did you respect my valve when
you implanted it, Dr. Austin?

17:17.870 --> 17:20.673
I reviewed my surgical notes.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.243
Bradley Jenkins' surgery
went without incident.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.512
GORDON:
Uh, I think your surgical notes

17:25.545 --> 17:27.947
are missing some
very important details.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.917
Impossible. I'm an advocate
for transparency in everything,

17:30.950 --> 17:32.619
especially my reports.

17:32.652 --> 17:35.622
Our rep, Julian Booth,
was in that surgery

17:35.655 --> 17:36.923
and she documented it.

17:36.956 --> 17:40.427
Her notes tell
a very different story.

17:40.460 --> 17:43.230
That you tried to implant
the device backwards.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.967
I'm sorry, AJ,
that's what it says.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.038
I picked it up wrong,

17:52.071 --> 17:53.806
realized my mistake

17:53.840 --> 17:55.275
and I picked it up
the right way.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.410
-It was a nothingburger.
-Hey, stop talking.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.379
So you're admitting error.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.680
I am not.

18:06.519 --> 18:09.289
This isn't over.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.760
I've spoken
to some of the nurses.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.228
Apparently, he's a terror.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.096
This is gonna be easy.

18:17.130 --> 18:20.066
AJ Austin
is practically a magician

18:20.099 --> 18:22.969
in the OR.
If I needed surgery,

18:23.002 --> 18:26.139
he would be the doctor
that I ask for. So before

18:26.173 --> 18:29.476
you go and smear a man's name,
have a look...

18:29.509 --> 18:32.779
at the long list of people
whose lives he's saved.

18:34.013 --> 18:35.848
Sounds like you're rooting
for the wrong team.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.984
I am your partner.

18:38.017 --> 18:40.187
I am also the CEO
of this hospital

18:40.220 --> 18:42.655
and my board
doesn't want the finger

18:42.689 --> 18:45.525
pointing at one of their own
any more than you do.

18:45.558 --> 18:48.027
You have the power
to sway the board.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.830
All you need is proof.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.532
I want the truth.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.670
And the word
of one of your employees...

18:57.704 --> 19:00.106
is not gonna be enough.

19:00.139 --> 19:03.543
Well, partner, Julian and Austin

19:03.576 --> 19:05.212
weren't the only people
in that room.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.549
Let's be thorough.

19:11.584 --> 19:14.454
Hey, great.
So, good news, Floyd.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.823
Your lungs are clear,
but now Nurse Nevin and I

19:16.856 --> 19:18.124
are gonna take a look
at that leg.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.393
Oh w-wait a minute. I just
came in here for my cough.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.262
Don't pass up the chance
to show us some ankle.

19:23.196 --> 19:24.931
AUBREY:
Pop.

19:28.268 --> 19:31.037
All right, let's see
what we have here.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.412
What's wrong with Pops?

19:41.113 --> 19:42.415
We're gonna have to run
some tests,

19:42.449 --> 19:44.183
but I suspect
after years of smoking,

19:44.217 --> 19:46.719
he has what's called
peripheral vascular disease.

19:46.753 --> 19:49.021
What-what does...
what-does that mean?

19:49.055 --> 19:52.692
It means you did the right thing
bringing him in here today.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.931
What do you think's up
with Aubrey?

19:58.965 --> 20:00.700
She's what-- 17, 18?

20:00.733 --> 20:02.068
She's probably stoned.

20:02.101 --> 20:04.003
No, I don't think so.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.172
Well, clearly you don't know
what a high teenager looks like.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.207
(scoffs)
Actually, I do.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.612
I've been a solo act
for a while,

20:12.645 --> 20:14.947
but I'm starting to like
this double-team thing.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.283
Good.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.117
Then I'll keep teaching
you new tricks.

20:18.150 --> 20:21.087
Hopefully you're a fast learner.

20:28.295 --> 20:29.762
ZOEY:
Conrad, he has
a surprise for you.

20:29.796 --> 20:32.632
So we thought we'd come on by.
Well, go on, Henry.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.901
Dr. Conrad, I got to show you.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.202
Show me what?

20:36.235 --> 20:37.604
Oh...

20:37.637 --> 20:39.739
(chuckles)

20:41.808 --> 20:44.877
MVP? Oh...

20:44.911 --> 20:46.846
Oh!

20:47.914 --> 20:50.317
That is a big trophy.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.751
It's a big deal.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.219
Mm-hmm. It's a keeper.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.054
Coach gave it to me
after the game.

20:55.087 --> 20:58.591
Called me to home plate
in front of everybody.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.994
-Mm.
-I thought Daniel Pressley
was gonna get it.

21:02.028 --> 21:05.164
Hey, Daniel is good,
but most valuable player--

21:05.197 --> 21:06.666
-that is all you.
-(Zoey chuckles)

21:06.699 --> 21:08.435
Congrats, my man.

21:09.469 --> 21:12.204
Hey.
You okay, Bud?

21:13.440 --> 21:15.241
Honey, look at me.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.143
Why are you doing that?

21:17.176 --> 21:18.445
Doing what?

21:18.478 --> 21:20.146
What you just did

21:20.179 --> 21:21.981
with your head--
why are you doing that?

21:22.014 --> 21:24.851
I don't know.
But it wasn't a seizure.

21:24.884 --> 21:27.286
I never felt far away.

21:29.822 --> 21:30.990
Hey.

21:31.023 --> 21:33.360
You want to grab
some more napkins?

21:37.730 --> 21:39.265
Have you ever
seen him do that before?

21:39.298 --> 21:40.933
Once.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.536
While we were camping
in Stone Mountain.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.538
I thought he was
nervous, but-but...

21:45.572 --> 21:48.307
Okay, well, you look worried.

21:50.577 --> 21:51.978
Let's just take
a trip up to neurology,

21:52.011 --> 21:53.179
make sure everything's okay.

21:53.212 --> 21:56.315
Okay.
Better safe than sorry.

21:58.017 --> 22:00.520
(door opens)

22:07.860 --> 22:09.996
How's Marisol doing?

22:10.029 --> 22:12.899
This poor woman has been ignored
and dismissed by her doctors.

22:12.932 --> 22:16.168
She's been trying
to advocate for herself.

22:16.202 --> 22:18.871
All alone.

22:18.905 --> 22:21.140
But now she's your patient

22:21.173 --> 22:22.875
and you're helping her.

22:22.909 --> 22:25.378
She's not alone anymore.

22:27.246 --> 22:28.748
And you're not alone either.

22:37.390 --> 22:38.591
There.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.860
On her left ovary--
that a cyst?

22:40.893 --> 22:42.662
CONRAD:
No.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.731
It's a thick-walled,
fluid-dense mass in her adnexa.

22:44.764 --> 22:47.333
That's probably
a tubo-ovarian abscess.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.201
I'll get her on IV antibiotics
and order an aspiration.

22:49.235 --> 22:50.903
Yeah, minimally invasive

22:50.937 --> 22:52.772
and it'll tell us
exactly what we're dealing with.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.907
I'd say let me know if you need
anything, but you won't.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.018
No, all we want to know
is did Dr. Austin

23:06.052 --> 23:07.887
insert the device upside down?

23:07.920 --> 23:10.857
Dr. Bell put him
in an impossible position.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.692
He had no experience
with the new heart valve

23:12.725 --> 23:15.094
and yet he had to insert it.

23:15.127 --> 23:16.963
GORDON:
And that's why

23:16.996 --> 23:19.799
Ms. Booth was in the OR--
to give him guidance,

23:19.832 --> 23:21.801
to prevent a mistake.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.302
We need to understand

23:23.335 --> 23:26.405
exactly what happened,

23:26.439 --> 23:28.708
Dr. Okafor.
No judgment.

23:28.741 --> 23:31.611
The facts.
I know it's hard,

23:31.644 --> 23:33.580
because you work
closely together.

23:36.315 --> 23:40.620
Dr. Austin almost inserted
the valve upside down.

23:40.653 --> 23:43.656
He quickly course corrected.
It was a non-event.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.558
GORDON:
I don't understand.

23:45.592 --> 23:48.294
While Ms. Booth was there,
didn't she try to instruct him

23:48.327 --> 23:50.963
-on how to properly
insert that valve?
-Yes.

23:50.997 --> 23:53.399
-So he didn't listen.
-That is not unusual for him.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.167
It is his way.

23:55.201 --> 23:56.603
GORDON:
I'm sorry, uh, it's not unusual

23:56.636 --> 23:59.672
for Dr. Austin to ignore
expert instruction

23:59.706 --> 24:01.474
on a new device?

24:08.314 --> 24:11.283
Surgical errors
drop drastically

24:11.317 --> 24:13.753
when staff is encouraged
to speak up

24:13.786 --> 24:17.490
-if they see a problem.
-I agree with that principle,

24:17.524 --> 24:20.593
but Dr. Austin
knows what he's doing.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.495
-He is a rare exception.
-So, over the course

24:22.529 --> 24:24.597
of Bradley's surgery,

24:24.631 --> 24:28.300
Dr. Austin did every
little thing correctly?

24:31.571 --> 24:33.139
-No.
-Mm.

24:33.172 --> 24:35.274
Because he refused

24:35.307 --> 24:38.010
to listen to instruction...

24:39.245 --> 24:43.115
...and he may have
made a mistake

24:43.149 --> 24:46.418
that cost Bradley Jenkins
his life.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.823
Yes.

25:00.533 --> 25:04.804
DEVON:
In a minute, sedation will
kick in. You'll feel sleepy.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.707
-We'll aspirate the fluid
and go from there, okay?
-Okay.

25:07.740 --> 25:09.876
That crash C-section
and losing our son

25:09.909 --> 25:13.012
was the worst thing
that has ever happened to me,

25:13.045 --> 25:14.313
and I stayed because

25:14.346 --> 25:17.416
I desperately wanted
to try again,

25:17.449 --> 25:19.652
to be a mother.

25:19.686 --> 25:22.689
Please make sure they don't take
the good ovary.

25:22.722 --> 25:26.058
(laughing): Okay, it's
the last chance I have left.

25:26.092 --> 25:27.827
I'm gonna be here
the whole time.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.429
I will make sure that they
listen to you, okay?

25:30.462 --> 25:31.964
-Okay.
-Trust me.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.238
-CHU: She's under.
We're all set.
-MOSER: Needle for aspiration.

25:39.271 --> 25:42.274
Have a percutaneous drain
on standby.

25:45.077 --> 25:47.614
-(screams, sobbing)
-More sedation!

25:47.647 --> 25:49.749
I can't. Her blood pressure's
too low. It's 80/50.

25:49.782 --> 25:51.083
All right, let's do
an ultrasound.

25:51.117 --> 25:53.185
DEVON:
Go, come on.

25:53.219 --> 25:54.420
-Hurry.
-(screaming continues)

25:59.491 --> 26:01.527
MOSER:
There's no blood flow
to the left ovary.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.196
DEVON:
The ovary is twisted on itself.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.298
If we don't get her to surgery,
she'll lose it.

26:06.332 --> 26:08.635
Page GYN, tell them
to meet us up there now.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.138
All right.

26:12.171 --> 26:15.141
I've just drained the abscess.

26:15.174 --> 26:17.543
And now, if you want, Aubrey,

26:17.576 --> 26:20.446
I could teach you
how to pack it.

26:20.479 --> 26:22.148
Uh, m-me?

26:22.181 --> 26:23.783
Uh, no, that won't be necessary.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.152
Just teach me, I can get by.

26:26.185 --> 26:27.486
ALEC:
Yeah, Floyd's right. This is

26:27.519 --> 26:29.722
a lot of responsibility
for a teenager.

26:29.756 --> 26:32.491
I mean, it has to be done right,
but I have no doubt

26:32.524 --> 26:34.260
-that Aubrey can do it.
-But it's a staph infection

26:34.293 --> 26:35.728
and if we don't
properly treat it,

26:35.762 --> 26:37.596
it can spread to the bone,
and if that happens,

26:37.630 --> 26:39.231
he could lose the leg.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.400
But if Aubrey can help him
manage the infection,

26:41.433 --> 26:42.769
we can prevent that

26:42.802 --> 26:44.971
and keep him
out of the hospital.

26:47.707 --> 26:50.176
She'll need to be very thorough.

26:50.209 --> 26:53.179
Do you want to try?

27:04.290 --> 27:07.459
All right, come on.
Let's get you some gloves.

27:07.493 --> 27:09.962
There you go.

27:09.996 --> 27:13.265
You see, now, how when I pull
on the gauze, it doesn't move?

27:13.299 --> 27:15.267
You try.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.837
Maybe go from the other side.

27:17.870 --> 27:19.839
-Nice and tight.
-Oh...

27:19.872 --> 27:21.974
Oh.

27:22.008 --> 27:24.176
You know what, um...

27:24.210 --> 27:25.644
let's take a break.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.514
Here, come on.

27:31.417 --> 27:32.919
That was a good try.

27:35.187 --> 27:37.189
(indistinct conversations)

27:43.996 --> 27:46.065
Untouched pie.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.835
That's not like you.

27:48.868 --> 27:51.570
Thank you for meeting me
on such short notice, Abe.

27:51.603 --> 27:53.840
Hey, I'm always up
for the best pie in town.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.574
Besides, it sounded urgent.

27:58.745 --> 28:01.247
What do you know
about Gordon Page?

28:01.280 --> 28:04.383
Ambitious, dynamic,

28:04.416 --> 28:06.218
smart as hell.

28:06.252 --> 28:08.654
Thank you.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.757
That's a lot of high praise
coming from you.

28:10.790 --> 28:13.225
What's this about?

28:13.259 --> 28:16.595
A young patient of mine
died not long after

28:16.628 --> 28:18.197
putting the QuoVadis valve in--

28:18.230 --> 28:21.367
-the one that you recommended.
-I'm sorry.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.903
And now Gordon Page
is pointing a finger at me.

28:23.936 --> 28:26.939
He says I damaged it because
I handled it incorrectly.

28:26.973 --> 28:29.776
And, personally,
I think that's absurd.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.710
But have you ever experienced
anything like that?

28:31.744 --> 28:35.347
No, but I suppose I could have,

28:35.381 --> 28:37.917
if I hadn't had a device rep
in the OR with me

28:37.950 --> 28:39.786
to walk me
through the procedure.

28:39.819 --> 28:42.454
As did I.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.924
I just didn't listen to her.

28:48.895 --> 28:51.197
I don't know what to say,
Austin. I...

28:51.230 --> 28:53.199
This was bound to happen
sooner or later.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.201
You are great.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.569
But you're not invincible.
No one is.

28:57.603 --> 29:01.073
Your God complex has always been
your Achilles heel.

29:02.308 --> 29:05.077
You want my advice?

29:05.111 --> 29:06.478
Always.

29:06.512 --> 29:09.882
Learn humility.

29:09.916 --> 29:12.952
If you make a mistake, own it.

29:12.985 --> 29:17.824
It'll make you a better doctor.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.630
WARD:
The blood flow's cut off.

29:24.663 --> 29:27.099
In order to remove the mass,
we're going to have to

29:27.133 --> 29:31.070
-take the ovary.
-You can't untangle the adnexa?

29:31.103 --> 29:33.572
It's adherent to the posterior
cul-de-sac and side wall.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.574
I'm trying to dissect it,
but there's something blocking

29:35.607 --> 29:37.176
my visualization.

29:37.209 --> 29:39.478
-Could you save it
if you converted to open?
-Maybe.

29:39.511 --> 29:40.579
Maybe not.

29:40.612 --> 29:41.747
There's still a chance.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.615
We have to try.

29:43.649 --> 29:46.018
I can't put her through major
abdominal surgery for no reason.

29:46.052 --> 29:47.253
We have a reason.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.255
She wants children.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.290
As her doctors,
we have to honor that.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.325
You can tell me
with absolute certainty

29:53.359 --> 29:56.195
that she wants this at any cost?

29:56.228 --> 29:59.131
Yes.

29:59.165 --> 30:01.467
Convert to open.

30:21.720 --> 30:25.191
There-- the ovary's untangled.
Let's remove the mass.

30:25.224 --> 30:26.425
Metz.

30:30.596 --> 30:33.699
Wait.
What is this?

30:33.732 --> 30:35.734
DEVON:
It's... blue.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.536
What kind of tumor is blue?

30:37.569 --> 30:40.206
WARD:
It's not a tumor.

30:40.239 --> 30:41.807
DEVON:
Oh, my God.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.842
It's a surgical sponge.

30:48.514 --> 30:51.150
Aubrey, I think I kind of
put you on the spot back there.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.885
I'm really sorry about that.

30:52.919 --> 30:54.921
I just...

30:54.954 --> 30:57.990
get the sense that this is
something that you could do.

30:58.024 --> 31:01.060
And if I'm being honest,

31:01.093 --> 31:04.196
if you can tend
to his wounds at home,

31:04.230 --> 31:06.032
it would be better
for your grandfather

31:06.065 --> 31:07.766
not to be in the hospital.

31:07.799 --> 31:10.836
My mom was a nurse.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.338
No way.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.605
(chuckles)

31:13.639 --> 31:17.509
She taught me some stuff bef...

31:17.543 --> 31:20.246
She taught me some stuff
before she died.

31:22.281 --> 31:24.750
She made people better.

31:24.783 --> 31:27.553
But what if I'm not like her?

31:27.586 --> 31:30.622
What if I make Pops worse?

31:30.656 --> 31:34.026
Aubrey...

31:34.060 --> 31:36.762
I'm sure you're more like
your mother than you even know.

31:39.665 --> 31:41.433
Sometimes I wonder

31:41.467 --> 31:44.436
if I could be a nurse
like she was.

31:44.470 --> 31:48.407
Maybe you could start
with your grandfather.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.109
(elevator dings)

31:59.651 --> 32:03.555
Uh, Our CABG surgery is in
an hour and we need to prep.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.891
Dr. Hoffstead
is filling in for me.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.594
-You can scrub in with her.
-Are you ill?

32:08.627 --> 32:10.862
No. I'm pondering.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.799
Okay, so you can ponder

32:13.832 --> 32:15.134
during our case.

32:19.538 --> 32:21.807
Don't you want to operate?

32:23.842 --> 32:25.311
Yeah.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.313
I do.

32:27.346 --> 32:28.914
I need it.

32:28.947 --> 32:32.184
Like I need the sun...

32:32.218 --> 32:34.186
or peanut butter chocolate cups.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.922
But the sun hurts my eyes
and chocolate makes me bloat,

32:36.955 --> 32:40.026
so I won't be doing any of it,
not for a while.

32:40.059 --> 32:43.429
I'm benching myself from surgery
until further notice.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.664
Okay, well, even for you,

32:45.697 --> 32:48.834
that's dramatic.

32:48.867 --> 32:51.670
You made a mistake.
We all do.

32:51.703 --> 32:54.740
And Bradley paid for my mistake
with his life.

32:57.343 --> 33:01.180
You know, you were right
all along.

33:01.213 --> 33:02.814
My ego...

33:02.848 --> 33:05.117
Well, of course I was right.

33:05.151 --> 33:08.320
And it seems like you already
learned your lesson.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.956
So be better, come back,

33:10.989 --> 33:13.992
take your place inside the OR.

33:14.026 --> 33:17.896
The OR is a sacred place
and I blasphemed it.

33:17.929 --> 33:20.366
I don't have a place there.
Not now.

33:20.399 --> 33:22.368
And I will not
put another life at jeopardy

33:22.401 --> 33:24.570
until I learn humility.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.774
"Blessed are the meek."

33:35.847 --> 33:38.817
(groans)
It's been an hour.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.819
When can I take
this stupid hat off?

33:40.852 --> 33:43.555
(chuckles) Not until
you do the motion again,

33:43.589 --> 33:46.358
so we can see if your brainwaves
are normal or abnormal

33:46.392 --> 33:47.993
while you're doing the movement.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.296
Okay.

33:52.464 --> 33:55.334
What if he doesn't do it
while he's on the machine?

33:55.367 --> 33:59.004
Eh, we'll just try again.
It's the only way to know

33:59.037 --> 34:00.939
if it's a manifestation
of a seizure.

34:00.972 --> 34:03.675
Do I look like a mad scientist?

34:03.709 --> 34:05.944
(cackles)

34:05.977 --> 34:08.614
Ah, exactly
like a mad scientist.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.784
How's Nic? I haven't seen her
around the hospital.

34:12.818 --> 34:15.721
Yeah, she started a free clinic
that opened a few days ago.

34:15.754 --> 34:17.856
-She's doing great.
-You must be so proud.

34:17.889 --> 34:22.094
I am. Yeah, she's...
she's amazing.

34:22.128 --> 34:24.396
HENRY:
Oh, oh, can I go see Nurse Nic?

34:24.430 --> 34:26.265
I want to show her my trophy...

34:29.301 --> 34:31.603
Okay.
He's doing it again.

34:31.637 --> 34:33.071
(quietly):
Please, God.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.675
CONRAD:
That's normal.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.282
(machine beeps)

34:43.315 --> 34:45.217
All right,

34:45.251 --> 34:47.052
no abnormal brain activity.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.054
ZOEY:
If it's not a seizure,

34:49.087 --> 34:50.822
then why is he doing
that motion?

34:50.856 --> 34:54.660
Eh, it's a tic. Uh, very common
in kids Henry's age.

34:54.693 --> 34:58.130
He just makes a movement,
usually a reaction to something,

34:58.164 --> 35:00.966
and kind of gets
stuck in a loop.

35:00.999 --> 35:02.601
But it's definitely not...

35:02.634 --> 35:06.104
Definitely not a seizure.

35:06.138 --> 35:07.506
(chuckles softly)

35:07.539 --> 35:10.108
Told you.

35:15.714 --> 35:17.683
Hey. What are you doing?

35:17.716 --> 35:19.951
Writing a Chastain
admission form for Floyd.

35:19.985 --> 35:21.620
He needs heavy observation
and wound care.

35:21.653 --> 35:24.290
There's too great a risk
for amputation to send him home.

35:24.323 --> 35:25.924
PVD's chronic.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.826
Even if we cure this ulcer,
there will be others.

35:27.859 --> 35:29.261
He needs ongoing care.
Hospitals can't do that,

35:29.295 --> 35:32.030
-Aubrey can.
-Her hands shake.

35:32.063 --> 35:33.665
She can't look anyone
in the eye.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.367
She's a teenager
who may be a drug user

35:35.401 --> 35:37.603
and you want to put her
in charge of Floyd's care-- why?

35:37.636 --> 35:39.137
Look, you and I both know
that hospitals

35:39.171 --> 35:40.972
can be dangerous
for people Floyd's age.

35:41.006 --> 35:43.008
I mean, they get poked
and prodded all night long

35:43.041 --> 35:45.143
and exposed
to hospital-based infections.

35:45.177 --> 35:47.779
Sometimes home care
is just the better option.

35:47.813 --> 35:49.381
Yeah, that's right.
And you're preaching

35:49.415 --> 35:50.716
to the choir here,
but in this instance...

35:50.749 --> 35:52.484
Okay, let me
just show you something.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.820
All right?
She can do this.

35:56.054 --> 35:58.190
FLOYD:
(laughs)

35:58.224 --> 35:59.691
Not bad.

35:59.725 --> 36:01.827
-(exhales)
-Not bad at all.

36:03.262 --> 36:05.264
FLOYD:
Mm.

36:07.533 --> 36:09.901
Well, no need for a nurse.

36:09.935 --> 36:13.339
You're a natural,
just like your mom.

36:13.372 --> 36:15.541
ALEC:
Well, it looks like
you're headed home, Floyd.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.709
Got yourself a great nurse here.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.982
They left a sponge in me?

36:24.015 --> 36:27.386
How... how could this happen?

36:27.419 --> 36:29.721
I wish I could give you
a decent answer.

36:29.755 --> 36:32.691
But the truth is the mistake
is inexcusable and it never

36:32.724 --> 36:34.426
-should have happened.
-They must have
forgotten to remove it

36:34.460 --> 36:36.428
during your C-section.
It's rare, but it happens.

36:36.462 --> 36:39.265
It's been the cause
of all your pain

36:39.298 --> 36:41.166
for all these years.

36:41.199 --> 36:44.536
And you've suffered for so long
and it was avoidable.

36:44.570 --> 36:47.739
That day I lost my baby

36:47.773 --> 36:50.276
and they left me with...

36:50.309 --> 36:52.611
the pain.

36:52.644 --> 36:56.515
And then the guilt,
as if it were my own fault,

36:56.548 --> 36:59.385
as if it were in my head.

36:59.418 --> 37:01.553
And all of it...

37:03.322 --> 37:05.291
...it's gone.

37:05.324 --> 37:08.026
The pain that ruined my life,

37:08.059 --> 37:10.161
it's gone.

37:11.963 --> 37:13.365
I still have an ovary

37:13.399 --> 37:15.734
and I'm gonna
have a child someday.

37:15.767 --> 37:19.104
You fixed everything,
Dr. Pravesh.

37:19.137 --> 37:21.740
Thank you.

37:21.773 --> 37:24.410
All in a day's work
for this guy.

37:27.613 --> 37:29.247
Excuse me.

37:34.353 --> 37:36.422
Is he okay?

37:36.455 --> 37:39.090
He will be.

37:39.124 --> 37:40.959
Just lost his best friend.

37:40.992 --> 37:44.430
You are exactly what he needed.

37:58.310 --> 38:01.279
Thanks, for everything.

38:02.481 --> 38:05.917
-Oh. Of course.
-(Floyd chuckles)

38:05.951 --> 38:07.353
-Thanks, Doc.
-Of course. Always.

38:07.386 --> 38:08.754
-I'll see you soon, yeah?
-Thank you.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.956
-See you later.
-All right. Thank you.

38:10.989 --> 38:13.359
(exhales)

38:13.392 --> 38:15.794
(door closes)

38:15.827 --> 38:19.498
We had a scared, shy teenager
and I thought "drug addiction."

38:19.531 --> 38:21.266
Got that wrong.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.369
-Uh-huh.
-(chuckles)

38:23.402 --> 38:25.203
(clears throat)
So...

38:25.236 --> 38:27.339
who is it?

38:27.373 --> 38:29.007
Earlier, you got a little snippy
when I claimed

38:29.040 --> 38:30.709
you didn't know what a drug
addict looked like.

38:30.742 --> 38:32.143
Snippy?

38:32.177 --> 38:34.045
Yeah, definitely snippy.

38:35.881 --> 38:37.849
My sister.

38:37.883 --> 38:39.518
I have recently come to terms

38:39.551 --> 38:42.721
with the fact that I am
a classic codependent.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.990
Well, as a former codependent,

38:45.023 --> 38:47.158
I guess there are some things
I can teach you.

38:49.094 --> 38:50.962
You want to get dinner?

38:50.996 --> 38:53.031
(door opens)

38:53.064 --> 38:54.833
-NIC: Hey.
-Hey. Good to see you.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.535
HENRY:
Nurse Nic!

38:56.568 --> 38:59.905
Hey, Henry, what's going on?
What are you doing here?

38:59.938 --> 39:01.239
CONRAD:
He wanted to show you something.

39:01.272 --> 39:03.341
Oh, yeah?
What do you got?

39:03.375 --> 39:06.244
-A trophy.
-(gasps) No way.

39:06.277 --> 39:07.413
NIC:
Are you serious?

39:07.446 --> 39:10.749
That is so awesome.
High five.

39:10.782 --> 39:12.418
Looks like your son
is a star baseball player.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.889
Oh, no.
We're-we're not, um...

39:17.923 --> 39:20.826
Conrad is-- was-- our doctor.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.661
And now we're...

39:22.694 --> 39:24.763
We're friends.

39:26.097 --> 39:28.400
And they're together.

39:31.937 --> 39:34.740
Uh, I guess that's my cue
to say good night, all.

39:34.773 --> 39:37.409
Good night.

39:38.644 --> 39:40.779
-I'll just be a second.
-Okay.

39:40.812 --> 39:43.549
Ah...
(sighs)

39:43.582 --> 39:46.351
Bye, Dr. Conrad.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.719
-Bye.
-ZOEY: Ready?

39:47.753 --> 39:50.155
-Bye.
-NIC: Bye.

39:51.457 --> 39:53.425
(door closes)

40:05.236 --> 40:07.473
You have something to say?

40:07.506 --> 40:09.775
You, of all people--

40:09.808 --> 40:11.710
a surgeon who has made
many mistakes--

40:11.743 --> 40:14.613
did not protect Dr. Austin.

40:14.646 --> 40:17.983
I will protect him.
Even if he's named in a lawsuit.

40:18.016 --> 40:20.552
He won't lose his job
and he'll be back in the OR.

40:20.586 --> 40:22.588
No one can protect The Raptor
from The Raptor.

40:22.621 --> 40:23.889
He's benched himself.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.224
He won't operate.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.460
We are surgeons.

40:28.494 --> 40:31.830
Gordon Page is not.

40:31.863 --> 40:33.832
He doesn't know what it takes
to cut into the heart

40:33.865 --> 40:36.301
of a living human being
and end up curing them,

40:36.334 --> 40:38.269
not killing them.

40:38.303 --> 40:40.872
But you're his lapdog.
Why?

40:45.310 --> 40:48.480
If you won't tell me,
I will find out another way.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.485
You have my word.

41:05.063 --> 41:08.600
(chuckles) Yeah, maybe we don't
send this one to his mom.

41:08.634 --> 41:11.002
It's not really
memorial material.

41:13.639 --> 41:15.807
What about this?

41:15.841 --> 41:17.008
(laughing)

41:17.042 --> 41:18.443
NIC:
Dust Bunny.

41:18.476 --> 41:19.711
Now, that's Bradley.

41:19.745 --> 41:21.880
Ah, our intern class photo.

41:23.214 --> 41:25.483
NIC:
Man, you hate that white coat.

41:25.517 --> 41:27.485
-Yup.
-You could've
at least worn a tie.

41:27.519 --> 41:30.021
Yeah, well I wore one last week
for Devon's wedding,

41:30.055 --> 41:31.489
so there's that.

41:35.260 --> 41:36.828
What do you got?

41:36.862 --> 41:38.463
* If I had everything *

41:38.496 --> 41:42.033
* Everything *

41:42.067 --> 41:44.536
* I could change anything *

41:44.570 --> 41:46.171
* I could
change anything *

41:46.204 --> 41:47.806
(knocking)

41:47.839 --> 41:49.074
* If I changed anything *

41:49.107 --> 41:50.709
MINA:
Pizza. Someone grab plates.

41:50.742 --> 41:52.911
* I mean anything *

41:52.944 --> 41:55.847
* I would change everything... *

41:55.881 --> 41:57.348
Hi.

41:57.382 --> 42:00.318
I didn't know Henry
had a checkup today.

42:00.351 --> 42:02.688
He looked good.

42:04.189 --> 42:06.558
So did Zoey.

42:06.592 --> 42:08.994
(chuckles)

42:09.027 --> 42:11.863
Yeah, after Bradley, I just
wanted to lay eyes on him.

42:11.897 --> 42:14.766
-Hmm.
-How are things
at the clinic, with Alec?

42:14.800 --> 42:17.603
He seems to really care
about what we're doing.

42:17.636 --> 42:19.905
Mm. Well, that's good.

42:19.938 --> 42:21.740
-(chuckles)
-(door closes)

42:21.773 --> 42:24.475
Come on, let's eat.

42:29.280 --> 42:32.050
Yes.

42:32.083 --> 42:34.620
Why is there pineapple
on this pizza?

42:34.653 --> 42:36.822
It's a Hawaiian pie.

42:38.489 --> 42:41.126
Bradley always said
it tastes like vacation.

42:42.894 --> 42:44.229
(short chuckle)

42:45.764 --> 42:47.733
To Bradley.

42:47.766 --> 42:49.300
* If I changed anything *

42:49.334 --> 42:51.469
* I mean anything... *

42:51.502 --> 42:54.405
-NIC: To Bradley.
-To Bradley.
-CONRAD: To Bradley.

42:54.439 --> 42:56.942
* I would change everything,
oh, yeah... *

42:56.975 --> 42:59.645
The patient died
because his heart valve failed

42:59.678 --> 43:03.248
after, allegedly, being
mishandled by his surgeon.

43:03.281 --> 43:04.883
Did you want me to write
"defective valve"

43:04.916 --> 43:07.552
or "operator error"
on the death certificate?

43:07.585 --> 43:10.421
* See, 'cause you've never been
the same as anyone else *

43:10.455 --> 43:12.557
* Don't think the same
as everyone else... *

43:12.590 --> 43:15.761
Neither. The patient died
of heart failure

43:15.794 --> 43:17.696
due to underlying disease.

43:22.968 --> 43:28.707
* Your... *

44:11.049 --> 44:13.018
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:15.486 --> 44:17.222
You survived your shift
with The Resident.

44:17.255 --> 44:19.825
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:22.060 --> 44:23.862
Welcome to the galaxy.

44:25.063 --> 44:27.032
Should be fun. I'll lead.

44:28.867 --> 44:31.737
* We're breaking waves
Shooting stars *

44:31.770 --> 44:33.138
We're gonna make a run for it.

44:33.171 --> 44:34.372
* Live for glory, not forever *

44:34.405 --> 44:38.844
-Go!
-* Reach out *

44:38.877 --> 44:42.413
* Make this right here
Right now *

44:42.447 --> 44:46.217
* Stand up *

44:46.251 --> 44:49.020
-* Here right now *
-Now!
