01:09.570 --> 01:13.274
"Does your husband
work late at the office
to avoid being around you?"

01:13.341 --> 01:15.376
I ain't got no husband.

01:15.443 --> 01:17.911
I wonder if George
feels that way.

01:17.978 --> 01:21.482
Mr. Jefferson? (SCOFFS)
He loves being around you.

01:21.549 --> 01:22.683
Where is he anyway?

01:22.750 --> 01:25.286
Working late at the office.
Again.

01:27.355 --> 01:29.056
(GEORGE VOCALIZING)

01:29.123 --> 01:31.459
GEORGE: Weezy, I'm home.

01:33.727 --> 01:36.597
George, why were you working
late at the office again?

01:36.664 --> 01:38.866
I had to get some reports out
today, Weez.

01:38.932 --> 01:42.102
-Are you sure
you're not trying to avoid me?
-What are you talking about?

01:42.170 --> 01:44.172
Well, I was just reading
that some husbands...

01:44.238 --> 01:45.973
Oh, hey, Weezy, I got some
great news for you.

01:46.039 --> 01:49.310
Guess who Black Life Magazine
is gonna interview
for its next issue?

01:49.377 --> 01:50.711
How should I know?

01:50.778 --> 01:52.246
'Cause one of them is you!

01:52.313 --> 01:55.349
-Huh?
-And the other one is me.
(LAUGHS)

01:55.416 --> 01:57.318
But...

01:57.385 --> 02:01.121
Why would a big magazine like
Black Life wanna interview us?

02:01.189 --> 02:03.257
'Cause Jack Jacobs
is out of town.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.958
Oh...

02:05.025 --> 02:07.228
-What?
-Look, they're doing
an article

02:07.295 --> 02:10.464
on couples
who have been happily married
for over 25 years.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.266
-I still don't understand.
-Look, Weezy,

02:12.333 --> 02:14.602
they were supposed
to interview my lawyer,
Jack Jacobs.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.670
He's been married
for 37 years.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.939
But at the last minute,
he had to go to Brazil.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.007
Business trip?

02:20.073 --> 02:21.642
No.
He ran off with his secretary.

02:24.378 --> 02:27.681
That's terrible.
His poor wife!

02:27.748 --> 02:30.017
He left her a note.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.486
Just a note?
Is that all he left her?

02:32.553 --> 02:34.688
No.
He also left her five kids.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.827
-Hi, Mr. Jefferson.
-Hi.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.562
Do you think these letters
are the right size?

02:41.629 --> 02:43.597
I wanna make sure
I can fit everything on.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.466
Of course
they can fit everything on.
Look,

02:45.533 --> 02:46.900
you've already got
the Z-E, right?

02:46.967 --> 02:49.570
All you need is the B-R-A,
you got it made.
(LAUGHS)

02:54.242 --> 02:58.846
George, Alan's shirt is gonna
say "Zero Population Growth".

02:58.912 --> 03:00.914
Whoever heard
of growing zeros?

03:02.149 --> 03:05.152
It's a movement to reduce
the birth rate to zero.

03:05.219 --> 03:07.288
The world already has
too many people living in it.

03:07.355 --> 03:11.659
Oh. So does this apartment.
When are you gonna move out?
(LAUGHS)

03:11.725 --> 03:14.695
George, you said that
he could stay
as long as it takes

03:14.762 --> 03:16.430
to work things out
with his father.

03:16.497 --> 03:19.433
Yeah. I must have been drunk.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.503
Just don't get in the way
of that guy from the magazine
when he gets here.

03:22.570 --> 03:27.140
-What magazine?
-Oh, George and I are being
interviewed for Black Life.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.311
Black Life?
Ooh, they got some
great articles in there.

03:30.378 --> 03:33.381
Yeah, but you'd only
understand half of them.
(LAUGHS)

03:37.318 --> 03:40.621
Mrs. Jefferson,
can I use your iron
to press on these letters?

03:40.688 --> 03:43.190
-Sure. Florence will show you
where it is.
-(DOORBELL RINGING)

03:43.257 --> 03:46.260
Now, how would Florence know
where the iron is?
She ain't never used it.

03:48.662 --> 03:51.299
-Hello, Louise.
-Oh, hi, Tom, Helen.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.666
Is Alan home?

03:52.733 --> 03:54.802
No. He's still living here.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.673
He's in the kitchen
working on a T-shirt.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.576
-Oh, well, then,
if he's busy, I'll just...
-Oh, no, you don't!

04:02.643 --> 04:05.946
Tom came down to ask Alan
to go skiing with him
this weekend.

04:06.013 --> 04:08.081
Oh, that sounds like fun!

04:08.148 --> 04:09.883
Do you think he'll wanna
go with me, Louise?

04:09.950 --> 04:11.852
Sure he'll wanna go!

04:11.919 --> 04:15.456
You and Alan are gonna feel
right at home up there in
all that whiteness. (LAUGHS)

04:18.292 --> 04:19.860
-Hi, folks.
-Hi, honey.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.595
Hey, Alan,
you wanna go skiing?

04:21.662 --> 04:23.263
Well, I didn't know you skied,
Mr. Jefferson.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.098
Not with me, with your father.

04:25.165 --> 04:27.768
-Hey, I'd like that.
-You would?

04:27.835 --> 04:30.538
See, Tom, it'll be
the perfect Father and
Son weekend.

04:30.604 --> 04:34.207
-(BOTH LAUGH)
-You're damn right
it'll be perfect.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.578
You and Alan up there in
the mountains, and me
and Weezy down here. (LAUGHS)

04:37.645 --> 04:40.348
-George!
-Say, I hear they got a foot
of fresh snow in Vermont.

04:40.414 --> 04:42.816
-Ah!
-Hey, you better hurry up
and get a move on

04:42.883 --> 04:45.486
-before it melts.
-You could drive up tonight.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.455
Yeah, I'll even
rent you a car.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.256
I'll buy you a new ski outfit!

04:49.323 --> 04:51.124
Well, what's wrong
with my leather jacket?

04:51.191 --> 04:53.794
Oh, that old thing?
Well, what if we run into
somebody we know?

04:53.861 --> 04:56.530
-We'll just say "Hello."
-(LAUGHING)

04:56.597 --> 04:59.600
Well, what I mean is,
what will people think if they
see you dressed like a...

04:59.667 --> 05:01.635
-Like a...
-Like a bum?

05:01.702 --> 05:03.904
Uh, uh, now, Alan,
your father didn't say that.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.940
Well, he didn't have to.
Dad, I'll wear
what I wanna wear.

05:07.007 --> 05:10.243
Oh, of course you will,
because you don't wanna do
anything I suggest, do you?

05:11.612 --> 05:12.680
Now, what do you mean by that?

05:12.746 --> 05:14.448
If I had told you to ski
in your leather jacket,

05:14.515 --> 05:16.984
you'd want me to buy you
a new ski outfit.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.852
Dad, I don't want you
to buy me anything!

05:18.919 --> 05:20.020
Good!
Because I'm not going to!

05:20.087 --> 05:22.222
Hey, hey, hey!

05:22.289 --> 05:25.225
Sounds like we have
a small misunderstanding here.

05:25.292 --> 05:27.995
-You call that small?
-(GASPING)

05:28.061 --> 05:31.399
Did you hear that, everybody?
He called me a fat slob!

05:34.935 --> 05:38.672
Well, you can't
get mad at your kid
for telling the truth, Willis.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.374
Tom, that's not
what Alan meant.

05:40.441 --> 05:41.875
Oh, you're always
taking his side.

05:41.942 --> 05:46.514
-Dad, there's nothing wrong
with being fat.
-(GASPING)

05:46.580 --> 05:49.082
Did you hear that?
He said it again!

05:49.149 --> 05:51.985
Well, I may be a little plump
around the waist,

05:52.052 --> 05:54.087
but at least
I'm not fat-headed!

05:54.154 --> 05:56.490
-Dad, what I meant was...
-Your sister would never talk
to me the way you do.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.191
Dad, Jenny and I
are different!

05:58.258 --> 05:59.860
You ain't lying. (CHUCKLES)

06:01.228 --> 06:03.330
Now, Tom, that's not fair.

06:03.397 --> 06:04.832
That's okay, Mom.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.435
I've always known
that Dad likes Jenny
better than me.

06:07.501 --> 06:10.438
Alan, your father
didn't say that. Did you, Tom?

06:10.504 --> 06:12.806
-Tom, tell him.
-No! You tell him!

06:12.873 --> 06:14.642
He never listens
to what I say!

06:14.708 --> 06:16.577
Hey, Willis,
you're forgetting something!
Your son!

06:16.644 --> 06:18.078
I wish I could forget him!

06:18.145 --> 06:19.780
-Tom!
-(DOOR SLAMMING)

06:26.454 --> 06:28.422
Poor Alan.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.390
Poor us. He's still here.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.561
That's not what I meant.

06:33.627 --> 06:37.264
We've gotta convince Alan
that Tom didn't mean
what he said.

06:37.330 --> 06:39.800
Sounded like
he meant it to me.
That was some argument.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.505
Argument. That's it!

06:44.572 --> 06:47.875
-What's it?
-You and I
will fake an argument

06:47.941 --> 06:50.110
to show Alan
that when people argue,

06:50.177 --> 06:52.179
they can say things
they don't really mean.

06:52.980 --> 06:53.981
Hmm.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.751
Um, George,

06:57.818 --> 07:01.522
I think an aquarium would
look nice in this apartment.

07:01.589 --> 07:05.258
-What?
-I don't know why
you won't let me buy one.

07:05.325 --> 07:07.461
If you want one,
go out and buy one.

07:10.498 --> 07:13.701
Yesterday you said you didn't
want an aquarium in here.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.603
I did?

07:15.669 --> 07:17.337
Oh, right, I did!

07:17.404 --> 07:19.773
I hate aquariums!

07:19.840 --> 07:23.310
Well, just because
you hate fish doesn't mean
I can't have fish as pets.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.979
You want a pet, get a parrot!

07:26.046 --> 07:27.915
What's so great
about a parrot?

07:27.981 --> 07:30.718
Well, at least you can
talk to them. Fish are boring!

07:30.784 --> 07:32.520
-No, they're not!
-Yes, they are.

07:32.586 --> 07:36.757
And people who watch fish
are twice as boring!

07:36.824 --> 07:39.226
-What!
-Pretty good, huh?
(CHUCKLING)

07:41.662 --> 07:45.633
Are you saying,
because I like aquariums,
that I'm boring?

07:45.699 --> 07:50.403
That's right. In fact,
every time you open your mouth
to talk, I open mine to yawn.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.044
You mean, I'm so boring

07:57.110 --> 08:00.113
that you would work late
to avoid being around me?

08:00.180 --> 08:04.618
Yep. You are so boring
I'd rather spend an evening
with King Tut.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.420
(SOFTLY) Go on, Weez,
it's your turn.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.823
What do you mean I'm boring?

08:09.890 --> 08:12.192
(CHUCKLES) Come on, you two.

08:12.259 --> 08:16.063
I know what
you're trying to do,
but it's not gonna work.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.766
Thanks anyway.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.768
Well, we tried.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.704
George, answer me!
What do you mean I'm boring?

08:27.274 --> 08:29.176
Weezy, it's over. He's gone.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.111
I don't care who's gone!

08:32.279 --> 08:34.214
I wanna know
why you said that.

08:34.281 --> 08:36.216
Weez, will you cut it out
and quit acting stupid?

08:38.085 --> 08:41.154
Oh, so now, I'm stupid, too.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.157
Boring and stupid.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.126
Weezy, you're impossible.

08:46.193 --> 08:50.664
(GASPING) Boring, stupid
and impossible!
A triple threat.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.801
-I give up!
-It's a wonder
you ever married me.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.970
-What!
-Excuse me. I'm going upstairs
to see Helen.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.538
Hey, wait a minute.
You can't do that.

08:58.606 --> 08:59.840
The man from the magazine
will be here any minute!

08:59.907 --> 09:01.742
Go ahead and start without me,
George.

09:01.809 --> 09:04.612
-I'd just put him to sleep
anyway.
-Weezy...

09:13.486 --> 09:15.923
Oh, how could I
have said such a thing?

09:16.890 --> 09:20.327
Oh, what a lousy father
you are.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.597
Are you sure
I'm fun to be with?

09:23.664 --> 09:27.768
Louise,
you're a barrel of laughs.
(NERVOUS GIGGLE)

09:30.237 --> 09:34.007
Oh, here's that trophy
Alan gave me
when he was 10 years old.

09:34.074 --> 09:37.244
"To the world's
greatest father."

09:37.310 --> 09:39.713
Oh, why can't things
be like that again?

09:39.780 --> 09:43.450
They can, dear.
All you have to do is say
"I'm sorry."

09:43.516 --> 09:46.286
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Not to me. To Alan.

09:46.353 --> 09:49.723
-But am I interesting?
-Yes, Louise.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.792
-Well, what if he'll never
speak to me again?
-Tom...

09:51.859 --> 09:53.794
Helen, do you really
mean that?

09:53.861 --> 09:55.562
-Of course, Louise!
-(DOORBELL RINGING)

09:55.629 --> 09:58.131
Thank goodness.
I was starting to get dizzy.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.670
-George!
-Weezy.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.572
Weezy, I...

10:06.840 --> 10:07.841
(WHISPERS)

10:09.209 --> 10:11.344
I don't wanna talk to you.

10:11.411 --> 10:14.114
Good. 'Cause I don't wanna
talk to you either!

10:14.181 --> 10:16.449
-I wanna talk to her.
-That was her.

10:16.516 --> 10:17.517
Say what?

10:20.688 --> 10:22.856
She doesn't want to bore you.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.858
Look, Weezy,
do you really think
I'd stay married to you

10:24.925 --> 10:28.561
for 28 years
if I thought you were boring?
Huh?

10:28.628 --> 10:33.000
All I want is to be a father
to my son again.

10:33.066 --> 10:36.103
-Oh, yes, dear.
-Look, you can
talk to him anytime.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.971
Right now I need you to
get my answer from Weezy.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.741
-Hey, she's my wife!
-And she's my wife.

10:40.808 --> 10:43.043
-Come on, Weezy,
we're getting out of here.
-Oh...

10:49.116 --> 10:51.018
I'm not... I mean,

10:51.084 --> 10:54.822
she's not going anywhere
with somebody who finds her
boring, stupid and impossible.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.489
Damn it, I never said that!

10:59.292 --> 11:01.328
Oh, yes, you did, shorty.

11:02.629 --> 11:04.965
-Shorty?
-I added that myself.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.804
Okay, if this is all true,

11:10.871 --> 11:14.207
why do I feel like I just got
kicked in my stomach?

11:14.274 --> 11:17.310
Like the most important thing
in my life is gone?

11:24.517 --> 11:27.755
Oh, George,
that's the nicest thing
you've ever said.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.991
Oh, that's from her.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.659
Are you coming with me?

11:32.726 --> 11:34.427
Yes, dear.

11:34.494 --> 11:35.796
Oh...

11:35.863 --> 11:39.366
See, Tom,
how easy it is to make up
if you really want to?

11:39.432 --> 11:41.368
You could do
the same thing with Alan.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.536
Hurry up.
The guy from the magazine
will be here any minute.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.939
Oh, that's all
you want me for!

11:46.006 --> 11:48.441
-The guy from what magazine?
-Black Life.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.377
Black Life?
What's he coming here for?

11:50.443 --> 11:53.413
-He was supposed
to interview us.
-Why?

11:53.480 --> 11:56.784
Because we're
a happily married couple.
Come on, Weezy. Weezy...

11:58.185 --> 12:01.421
Okay, you stay up here
as long as you want!
See if I care!

12:04.858 --> 12:06.026
(DOORBELL RINGING)

12:10.230 --> 12:12.032
-Mr. Jefferson?
-Yeah?

12:12.099 --> 12:13.801
I'm Albert Fox
from Black Life.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.837
Ah, come on in. Hey...
Let me take your coat.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.506
-Uh, you already have.
-(LAUGHING)

12:22.042 --> 12:23.811
Nice place you have here.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.645
Yeah, well you know,
it ain't much, but, uh,

12:25.712 --> 12:28.248
it suits someone
in my profession.
(LAUGHS)

12:28.315 --> 12:30.750
-Oh?
-Yes.

12:30.818 --> 12:33.020
I own
The Jefferson Dry Cleaners.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.488
Seven convenient locations
throughout the city.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.392
One near you. (LAUGHS)

12:39.459 --> 12:41.895
-It's not turned on.
-Oh.

12:41.962 --> 12:44.231
-Well, shall we get started?
-Sure.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.565
Now...

12:45.632 --> 12:47.667
Where's your wife?

12:47.734 --> 12:49.536
Oh, well, I can speak
for both of us.

12:49.602 --> 12:53.040
But the purpose of the article
is to talk with
married couples.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.408
Oh, I see, well, see,
she's not feeling very well.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.277
Oh, perhaps we should
cancel the interview.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.512
Oh, no. Hey...
I'll tell you what you can do.
Why don't you just

12:59.579 --> 13:01.014
write down all the questions
you want me to ask her,

13:01.081 --> 13:02.349
and I'll take them
into the bedroom

13:02.415 --> 13:04.184
and bring her answers
back out here to you.

13:04.251 --> 13:07.988
If she's well enough
to answer the questions,
why can't I ask her in person?

13:08.055 --> 13:12.359
Well see because
what she's got is very
contagious. It's a rash.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.828
You can't get near her.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.830
-Oh, there she is. Hello.
-(GEORGE CLEARS THROAT)

13:16.897 --> 13:19.499
-Hello. I'm...
-No, that's okay.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.903
I'm Albert Fox.

13:22.970 --> 13:26.573
Well, pleased to meet you,
Mr. Fox. If you'll excuse me,
I got work to do.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.244
Nice woman, your wife.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.680
My wife? She ain't...

13:33.746 --> 13:36.884
Oh! (LAUGHS) You know,

13:36.950 --> 13:41.388
that dear sweet woman is more
than just a wife.

13:41.454 --> 13:44.858
You know that she's
in that kitchen right now
packing up some of our dishes

13:44.925 --> 13:46.659
to give to somebody
who's less fortunate.

13:46.726 --> 13:48.761
Well, I thought she wasn't
feeling very well.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.797
Yeah, well, that's my Louise
for you.

13:50.864 --> 13:53.066
Nothing stops her from being
kind and generous.

13:54.968 --> 13:59.439
Excuse me, uh,
but could I ask you
a few questions?

13:59.506 --> 14:01.308
Sure, if it's okay
with the boss.

14:01.374 --> 14:04.711
You call him "the boss"?
(CHUCKLES)
Well, that's cute.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.881
How did you two meet?

14:07.948 --> 14:10.817
-What two?
-Uh, you and the boss.

14:11.651 --> 14:12.719
Through an agency.

14:14.554 --> 14:15.989
An agency?

14:18.125 --> 14:20.460
Yeah. He needed somebody,

14:20.527 --> 14:22.329
and the agency sent me over.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.668
Well, that's not
very romantic.

14:28.735 --> 14:31.171
(LAUGHING) But it's worked out
very well.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.973
We've been happy ever since.
Haven't we, sweetheart?

14:33.040 --> 14:34.774
-Don't put your hands on me.
-Oh!

14:36.209 --> 14:39.279
I forgot. The rash.

14:39.346 --> 14:43.183
Tell me, uh, what happened
when you got here?

14:43.250 --> 14:44.584
Well, I asked
a few questions.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.955
Found out what I had to do
to please him, and said okay.

14:48.021 --> 14:51.891
-My goodness, Mr. Jefferson,
you're a fast worker.
-(LAUGHING)

14:56.163 --> 14:57.864
-What's this for anyway?
-I'm...

14:57.931 --> 15:00.800
Here, let me
help you with these
before you drop them.

15:00.867 --> 15:03.937
Look, stay out of his way.

15:04.004 --> 15:07.840
-Why? Who is he?
-An IRS agent.
He's checking tax returns.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.643
I don't send my taxes in
until April.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.245
Then you're one of the people
he's looking for.

15:20.720 --> 15:24.457
Do you think I could
get your wife to sit down
for a few minutes?

15:24.524 --> 15:27.227
Sit down? Well, uh...
(CLEARS THROAT)
Well, see, uh,

15:27.294 --> 15:30.563
that's where her rash
hurts the most.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.932
-(DOORBELL RINGING)
-I'll be right back.

15:36.569 --> 15:39.639
-Hey, Mr. Jefferson,
here's your cleaning.
-Thanks, Marcus.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.342
Oh, is Florence around?
She said she had some stuff
to be picked up.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.411
No, she ain't here.

15:44.477 --> 15:47.680
Oh, there she is.
Hey, Florence...

15:47.747 --> 15:49.382
-Oh, hi, Marcus.
You here for the cleaning?
-Yeah.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.619
-I'll get it for you.
-Here, here,
take these with you.

15:52.685 --> 15:56.689
-Hello, I'm Albert Fox.
-Marcus Henderson.

15:56.756 --> 16:01.995
-I'm curious. Why did you call
Mrs. Jefferson Florence?
-I didn't.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.464
Yes, you did.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.266
And I've told you
a million times,

16:06.333 --> 16:08.568
stop calling people
by their middle names!

16:10.670 --> 16:14.007
-Did I miss something?
-Let me get this straight.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.843
It's Louise Florence
Jefferson.

16:16.909 --> 16:20.580
Oh, I didn't know
Mrs. Jefferson's middle name
is Florence.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.615
That's why she never uses it.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.951
She doesn't want us
to get confused
with the real Florence.

16:25.018 --> 16:27.254
-Mmm.
-Who is the real Florence?

16:27.320 --> 16:28.821
-The dog.
-The maid.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.959
I think I'm confused.

16:33.026 --> 16:36.296
-Could I have
a drink of water?
-Oh, sure. Right here.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.365
You can drink all you want
in private.

16:42.435 --> 16:45.072
-Here you are, Marcus.
-Oh, thanks, Florence.

16:45.138 --> 16:47.240
-Is Mr. Fox gone?
-No! But you are!

16:47.307 --> 16:50.043
-But...
-Go! Shh! Go!

16:51.244 --> 16:52.645
And so are you!

16:52.712 --> 16:54.047
Where am I going?

16:54.114 --> 16:56.183
Well, why don't you try
your hope chest?

16:56.249 --> 16:58.251
Nobody'll look for
you in there.

17:02.889 --> 17:05.558
-Weezy!
-George, I thought it over,

17:05.625 --> 17:08.228
and I realized that you don't
really think I'm boring.

17:08.295 --> 17:10.297
Yes, I do, Weezy.
You're boring, boring, boring.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.765
Look,
if you come back in an hour,
I'll change my mind.

17:12.832 --> 17:16.936
Oh, George, you're just trying
to show me how silly I was.
Now, let's kiss and make up.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.475
Mr. Jefferson!

17:22.542 --> 17:25.312
Oh, you must be the reporter
from Black Life.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.846
Yes.

17:26.913 --> 17:29.482
Uh, did George tell you
how much in love we are?

17:31.584 --> 17:34.887
Does your wife
know about this?

17:34.954 --> 17:38.658
-GEORGE: Well...
-Hi, Mrs. Jefferson,
thanks again for the dishes.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.026
Mrs. Jefferson?

17:40.093 --> 17:41.161
Yes?

17:42.295 --> 17:44.197
Then who are you?

17:44.264 --> 17:46.699
Nobody special,
and my tax return
is just fine, thank you.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.638
Well, wait a minute.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.640
Why would he care
about your tax return?

17:53.706 --> 17:55.542
Because Mr. Fox is here
checking tax returns.

17:55.608 --> 17:58.945
No, I'm a writer
from Black Life!

17:59.011 --> 18:01.581
A writer? I thought you were
with the IRS.

18:01.648 --> 18:04.083
That's funny.
I thought you were his wife.

18:04.151 --> 18:05.918
Ain't nothing funny
about that.

18:08.288 --> 18:09.689
Let me help you, Florence.

18:09.756 --> 18:13.626
-So you're Florence.
-Yes. Florence Johnston.

18:13.693 --> 18:17.930
J-O-H-N-S-T-O-N.

18:17.997 --> 18:20.967
Mr. Jefferson said that
Florence was the dog.

18:26.573 --> 18:29.509
No.
He just treats me like one.

18:29.576 --> 18:32.412
-Well, I better get back down
to the office.
-George!

18:34.080 --> 18:36.316
Okay, I'll explain everything.

18:38.418 --> 18:41.087
This is my real wife.

18:41.154 --> 18:44.557
Who I have been
happily married to
for 28 years.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.160
Only, it wasn't so happy
just before you got here.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.795
I'll bet you had an argument.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.564
How'd you know that?

18:51.631 --> 18:55.067
Because every happily married
couple I've ever interviewed
has admitted they argue.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.369
No kidding?

18:56.436 --> 18:58.605
Are you saying it's good
for people to argue?

18:58.671 --> 19:00.106
Absolutely.

19:00.173 --> 19:01.941
When a person takes the time
to argue with you,

19:02.008 --> 19:04.076
it's usually because
they care about you.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.145
-(DOORBELL RINGING)
-Hmm...

19:06.213 --> 19:08.881
Man, my dad must think
the world of me.

19:11.518 --> 19:14.120
-Alan, look, Son, I wanna...
-It's all right, Dad.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.289
I'm willing to forgive
and forget if you are.

19:16.356 --> 19:19.226
-Gee, that was easier
than I thought.
-(BOTH LAUGHING)

19:19.292 --> 19:21.361
Well, now that
that's all settled,

19:21.428 --> 19:25.064
Mr. Fox can continue
with his interview with me
and the real Mrs. Jefferson.

19:25.131 --> 19:27.700
-(LAUGHING)
-You mean I'm out of a job
already?

19:27.767 --> 19:30.803
You will be
if you don't get lost.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.605
See if I ever marry you again.

19:36.142 --> 19:37.910
Come on, Dad, I'll show you
some of my T-shirts.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.779
Oh, I'd love to see them.

19:39.846 --> 19:43.383
-Hey, do you want one?
-Son, I'd be proud to wear
anything that came from you.

19:43.450 --> 19:44.551
All right.

19:45.552 --> 19:48.488
Oh, isn't that nice?

19:48.555 --> 19:50.022
Okay, let's get on
with the interview.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.558
Good idea.

19:51.624 --> 19:56.329
Now, when you two argue,
how long do your arguments
last?

19:56.396 --> 19:58.565
Oh, sometimes
for a couple of days.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.567
But most of the time,
just for a few minutes.
Right, Weez?

20:00.633 --> 20:02.569
Oh, oh, yes.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.671
And we always settle them
right away. Don't we?

20:04.737 --> 20:08.641
Oh... Oh, sometimes we make up
before we even know
we've been arguing.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.942
(BOTH LAUGHING)

20:12.178 --> 20:14.681
You did it again!
You called me fat!

20:14.747 --> 20:18.117
I just said you needed
an extra, extra large T-shirt.

20:18.184 --> 20:20.553
-Which means
you think I'm fat.
-Hey, wait a minute, you two.

20:20.620 --> 20:24.891
Okay. You're skinny.
You're skinny as a rail.
Does that make you happy?

20:24.957 --> 20:27.694
No! If there's
one thing I hate, it's a liar.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.696
If there's one thing I hate,

20:29.762 --> 20:33.400
it's having my interview
messed up
by a zebra and a jackass!

20:33.466 --> 20:35.535
-George, what are you doing?
-Out! Out! Out! Out! Out!

20:35.602 --> 20:37.804
-Wait! I'm not finished yet!
-Yes, you are!

20:38.771 --> 20:40.540
George, that was awful!

20:40.607 --> 20:42.108
Look, forget about it, Weezy.
Let's get back
to the interview.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.677
Not until you apologize
to Tom and Alan.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.713
Are you crazy?
I ain't apologizing
to them two turkeys.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.315
-You will, too.
-No, I won't.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.283
-Oh, yes, you will!
-Will you just shut up

20:50.350 --> 20:52.385
-and get over there
and do your interview?
-Shut up?

20:52.452 --> 20:55.288
I am now continuing
my interview
on the happy marriage of

20:55.355 --> 20:56.889
-George and Louise Jefferson.
-I don't want them
in my house.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.024
Oh, this is my house,
too, buster!

20:58.090 --> 20:59.659
Would you care
to say a few words

20:59.726 --> 21:01.227
-to your wife, Mr. Jefferson?
-Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

21:01.294 --> 21:04.931
-And now you, Mrs. Jefferson.
-You little pip squeak!

21:06.633 --> 21:09.802
If you ever
call me that again,
I'll break you in two!

21:09.869 --> 21:13.039
-Oh, yeah? You calling me...
-These words represent
28 years

21:13.105 --> 21:15.107
-of a long wonderful...
-...your biggest part,
your mouth!

21:15.174 --> 21:17.009
And you'll be using
the smallest part
that you got! Your brain!

21:17.076 --> 21:20.012
