00:39.505 --> 00:41.630
Alia, tell Abel to come in.

00:41.713 --> 00:43.672
The sun is setting.
It's going to be dark soon.

00:44.297 --> 00:45.338
Okay, Mom.

00:53.755 --> 00:57.130
-Evening, Mang Asep.
-Evening, Miss.

00:57.213 --> 00:59.922
-I'll get going. I've finished work.
-Okay.

01:03.463 --> 01:04.922
Abel?

01:07.422 --> 01:08.755
Abel?

01:35.922 --> 01:36.880
Abel.

01:37.588 --> 01:39.838
I've been calling for you.

01:41.672 --> 01:43.797
Someone is behind the tree.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.005
There's no one.

02:07.797 --> 02:09.380
There was!

02:09.838 --> 02:11.297
He said...

02:11.713 --> 02:16.213
we cannot stay here
because it is his house.

02:16.380 --> 02:18.213
What does he look like?

02:21.380 --> 02:22.463
Let's go inside.

02:23.880 --> 02:25.963
He was there.

02:27.797 --> 02:29.755
I saw him.

02:30.213 --> 02:33.005
Do you not believe me?

02:35.338 --> 02:36.672
Abel.

02:37.672 --> 02:40.005
You've been like this several times.

02:40.672 --> 02:44.588
You say you saw someone,
but then there's nobody.

02:45.047 --> 02:46.797
It's just your imagination.

02:47.088 --> 02:49.922
Let's go inside. Mom is waiting for us.

03:11.630 --> 03:13.005
No!

03:13.088 --> 03:17.588
You will hurt your neck
if you sleep like this, Sweetie.

03:18.713 --> 03:20.672
What's wrong?

03:21.797 --> 03:26.922
If I don't listen to music,
I will hear other things.

03:27.088 --> 03:28.963
What other things?

03:29.547 --> 03:32.130
-Someone.
-Who?

03:33.588 --> 03:37.672
It's just a dream. Sleep tight, okay.

03:39.797 --> 03:42.838
-Good night, Sweetie.
-Good night, Mom.

04:52.338 --> 04:54.297
Abel!

04:54.755 --> 04:58.130
-Abel! Mom! Dad!
-Abel!

04:58.505 --> 05:00.172
There is something inside!

05:03.922 --> 05:06.047
Calm down, Abel. It's Mommy.

05:13.047 --> 05:14.088
Alia!

05:15.338 --> 05:17.838
What did you see? A person? A burglar?

05:20.838 --> 05:22.130
Alia!

06:18.713 --> 06:20.630
Looks like you're working hard.

06:21.088 --> 06:22.422
Need a hand?

06:22.713 --> 06:25.547
No, thanks. I'm almost done.

06:26.797 --> 06:29.005
-How long have you been here?
-Twenty minutes.

06:29.422 --> 06:32.338
-Twenty minutes?
-Yeah, I've been looking at you.

06:32.422 --> 06:35.463
You're so beautiful. I never get bored.

06:36.463 --> 06:38.588
Quit it, Davin!

06:38.755 --> 06:40.672
UNCLE HERMAN

06:41.130 --> 06:42.922
Just a sec.

06:47.922 --> 06:50.255
I'm doing fine. What's the matter?

07:08.588 --> 07:11.213
<i>I'm sorry that it had</i>
<i>to turn out like this, Alia.</i>

07:13.588 --> 07:15.963
<i>We cannot wait until you get home.</i>

07:17.088 --> 07:20.088
<i>Your parents needed to be buried</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

07:21.422 --> 07:25.713
<i>I'm sorry that you couldn't see them</i>
<i>one last time.</i>

07:26.130 --> 07:29.838
At that time, your parents' car

07:29.922 --> 07:32.630
tried to swerve from a truck

07:32.713 --> 07:35.255
that pushed its brakes all of a sudden.

07:36.380 --> 07:39.255
The truck was carrying steel

07:39.338 --> 07:43.047
and it went through the car.

07:50.713 --> 07:53.630
<i>Your parents were taken</i>
<i>to the hospital immediately.</i>

07:55.672 --> 07:57.463
But on the way there,

07:58.797 --> 08:00.713
they couldn't make it.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.047
Alia.

08:08.297 --> 08:09.713
You have to be strong.

08:11.255 --> 08:12.505
Be tough.

08:13.880 --> 08:14.963
Okay.

08:16.255 --> 08:19.797
It's fate. It has happened.

08:21.963 --> 08:23.922
I just want to tell you,

08:24.505 --> 08:25.672
Abel.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.422
Take care of her.

08:27.922 --> 08:31.755
You are the only family she has right now.

08:34.922 --> 08:38.297
I would like to tell you one thing
before I go back to Jogja.

08:40.047 --> 08:41.838
<i>About this house.</i>

08:43.005 --> 08:45.338
<i>It was your father's residence</i>
<i>from the company.</i>

08:46.838 --> 08:48.922
<i>Since your father has passed away,</i>

08:49.380 --> 08:51.838
<i>you can't stay here anymore.</i>

08:52.255 --> 08:54.422
<i>The company where your father works says</i>

08:54.505 --> 08:57.922
<i>that they will give you three months</i>

08:58.005 --> 09:00.047
<i>to pack up and move out.</i>

09:00.463 --> 09:01.755
<i>Maybe...</i>

09:02.672 --> 09:06.505
<i>you and Abel can go back</i>
<i>to the house your parents left you.</i>

09:07.422 --> 09:09.630
<i>Your childhood home.</i>

09:09.880 --> 09:14.297
<i>The one on Teratai Road.</i>
<i>It's been empty for almost a year.</i>

09:21.213 --> 09:24.297
BORN: NOVEMBER 14 1975
DIED: NOVEMBER 15 2017

09:30.963 --> 09:34.297
BORN: MARCH 09 1975
DIED: NOVEMBER 15 2017

09:44.672 --> 09:46.172
Abel.

09:48.338 --> 09:51.213
Bel? This is Alia.

09:54.505 --> 09:55.963
Abel.

10:11.588 --> 10:13.755
Bel. Hey.

10:14.505 --> 10:15.797
I'm home.

10:20.838 --> 10:24.088
This is Davin, my boyfriend.

10:24.713 --> 10:26.922
He came all the way from Bangkok.

10:40.463 --> 10:43.588
Everything is going to be okay.

10:44.338 --> 10:47.297
You're not alone. I'm here with you.

10:50.047 --> 10:52.297
I will take a job offer in Jakarta.

10:53.047 --> 10:55.422
And I will stay with you.

10:55.838 --> 10:59.255
We will be together
like the old times, okay?

11:09.297 --> 11:13.005
I will get things done quickly.
Including moving houses.

11:13.630 --> 11:14.547
Move?

11:15.130 --> 11:16.297
Yes.

11:17.047 --> 11:21.130
This house belongs to dad's company.
We can't stay here.

11:21.213 --> 11:22.963
Where are we staying then?

11:23.755 --> 11:26.838
Our old house. The one on Teratai Road.

11:30.672 --> 11:32.672
Yes, Sir, I will come to work next week.

11:33.422 --> 11:34.547
Thank you.

11:36.505 --> 11:38.297
Is everything okay?

11:39.005 --> 11:40.713
Thanks for accompanying me, Vin.

11:41.213 --> 11:43.088
But what about your work back there?

11:43.922 --> 11:47.963
Photographers don't go to work.
We're mobile.

11:48.297 --> 11:50.422
I can go to Bandung and even meet my dad.

11:51.088 --> 11:52.922
If I stay there, I can't concentrate.

11:53.130 --> 11:55.630
I can't leave just the two of you here.

12:01.297 --> 12:02.630
Are you sleepy, Bel?

12:05.505 --> 12:09.213
Can't we stay someplace else?

12:09.297 --> 12:11.630
Can't your new office
give you a place to rent?

12:12.547 --> 12:15.880
There's no harm
in staying at our own house, right?

12:15.963 --> 12:17.963
We should take care of the house
that Mom and Dad left us.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.422
But I don't like it there.

12:20.505 --> 12:22.213
Why not?

12:22.505 --> 12:25.380
Something else is there, besides us.

12:26.963 --> 12:30.255
Nothing is there, Bel.
That was a burglar.

12:30.338 --> 12:32.672
Your window wasn't closed all the way,
and it was unlocked.

12:33.422 --> 12:35.588
Dad said so.

12:35.672 --> 12:39.547
We filed a report
to the neighborhood as well. Remember?

12:41.505 --> 12:44.047
We've moved several times.

12:44.130 --> 12:47.422
When Dad had to move to Semarang,
Medan, and Balikpapan,

12:47.505 --> 12:49.088
we've always tagged along.

12:49.463 --> 12:52.422
And you were always like that,
not just in this house.

12:53.047 --> 12:54.172
Please stop for now.

12:58.380 --> 12:59.380
That's the house?

13:17.922 --> 13:21.380
-Mang Asep.
-Oh, Neng Alia!

13:21.963 --> 13:23.838
-How are you?
-I'm good.

13:24.297 --> 13:26.713
Neng Alia, Neng Abel,

13:26.797 --> 13:32.338
I offer my deepest condolences.
Please stay strong.

13:32.422 --> 13:34.172
Neng Abel, stay strong.

13:34.255 --> 13:38.088
Thank you.
And thanks for cleaning up the house.

13:38.172 --> 13:41.755
I'm not done yet,
the backyard needs mowing.

13:41.838 --> 13:45.547
There are leaks in some places, too!
The roof tiles have moved.

13:46.047 --> 13:46.922
Go ahead and take a look.

13:47.005 --> 13:50.172
-I'm going to go and see the house.
-Please do.

13:50.255 --> 13:51.838
Watch your step.

14:13.380 --> 14:15.338
Vin, I'm going to see my room upstairs.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.422
Your room is over there, the guest room.

15:07.297 --> 15:08.380
Vin!

15:08.463 --> 15:10.922
Your room is next door,
this is my parents' room.

15:14.338 --> 15:16.463
A lot needs to be fixed in this house.

15:17.047 --> 15:20.255
If we want to make it quick,
we can't do it with just the three of us.

15:20.463 --> 15:21.713
True.

15:21.797 --> 15:24.338
I'll tell Mang Asep
to get a few people down here.

15:24.797 --> 15:25.880
Let's go.

15:29.588 --> 15:31.547
Let me do it.

15:32.380 --> 15:34.297
It's been doing this for a long time.

15:35.713 --> 15:38.505
-Are you sure you can do this?
-Sure.

15:42.422 --> 15:43.422
See?

15:47.422 --> 15:48.422
See?

15:49.880 --> 15:51.922
Let's go and see your room.

15:56.047 --> 15:57.797
Here it is.

17:17.172 --> 17:18.838
Abel!

17:19.672 --> 17:21.797
Bel, let's eat!

17:24.755 --> 17:26.130
Bel?

17:27.755 --> 17:31.880
I made you petai fried rice,
your favorite!

17:36.380 --> 17:39.130
Bel, come on.

17:46.213 --> 17:49.255
Fine, you should just rest.

17:49.797 --> 17:52.797
But you have to go to school tomorrow.
I will take you.

17:53.088 --> 17:54.380
I don't want to!

17:55.380 --> 17:58.422
Bel, you've been absent too many times.

17:58.505 --> 18:01.630
Don't be like that. Go to school tomorrow.

18:01.713 --> 18:03.005
No.

18:04.005 --> 18:08.547
Abel, what's wrong with you?
Don't make me confused.

18:09.172 --> 18:11.797
Someone keeps following me in school.

18:15.213 --> 18:16.255
Bel.

18:16.547 --> 18:20.838
If you're absent for too long,
you won't be able to keep up.

18:21.005 --> 18:23.422
Your scores will be a mess.

18:27.880 --> 18:29.130
Bel.

19:37.338 --> 19:38.338
Sis?

20:46.380 --> 20:47.797
Al? What's wrong?

21:21.088 --> 21:23.963
Abel? What are you doing?

21:29.088 --> 21:31.047
Praying, so he will leave.

21:31.505 --> 21:33.005
Who?

21:33.338 --> 21:36.422
Something is in this house.

21:36.547 --> 21:38.047
Like a person, but not a person.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.505
-Nothing is here.
-There is!

21:40.922 --> 21:42.588
Bel, stop being like this.

21:42.672 --> 21:45.172
Please trust me.

21:52.755 --> 21:54.922
We'll find a psychiatrist tomorrow.

21:56.005 --> 21:57.963
We'll find a new one.

21:58.047 --> 22:00.130
Not the same person
Mom used to take you to.

22:01.047 --> 22:03.880
So that you won't be afraid
like this anymore.

22:04.505 --> 22:08.172
You won't think there's a person,
or something scary anymore.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.088
No more hallucinating.

22:10.505 --> 22:12.630
But I was never hallucinating.

22:13.380 --> 22:15.797
Mom never took me to a psychiatrist.

22:16.713 --> 22:18.297
She took me to Bu Windu.

22:19.380 --> 22:20.547
Bu Windu?

22:21.547 --> 22:22.505
Sis.

22:22.672 --> 22:25.672
I... can see them.

22:26.297 --> 22:29.005
Things that most people cannot see.

22:30.338 --> 22:33.713
I can see them, the dead.

22:34.672 --> 22:37.547
My third eye has been open
since I was little.

23:00.005 --> 23:03.213
Abel? You usually call before coming here.

23:03.630 --> 23:05.088
I'm sorry.

23:05.213 --> 23:07.755
This is Alia, my sister.

23:07.838 --> 23:09.422
Sis, this is Bu Windu.

23:10.213 --> 23:12.130
Alia, how are you?

23:12.672 --> 23:13.630
I'm fine.

23:13.963 --> 23:15.338
And this is her boyfriend, Davin.

23:17.755 --> 23:20.338
Can you explain to my sister
about the third eye?

23:26.047 --> 23:29.672
The third eye is also known
as the inner eye or the sixth sense.

23:29.755 --> 23:34.880
It's the ability to see the other world,
the supernatural.

23:35.963 --> 23:39.130
But not all people believe in
the existence of the third eye.

23:39.880 --> 23:41.838
Actually,

23:41.922 --> 23:44.797
the third eye and the other world exist.

23:47.213 --> 23:52.297
Everyone has a third eye
when they are born.

23:53.088 --> 23:57.547
The difference is,
some already have their eyes open,

23:57.630 --> 23:58.672
and some are still closed.

24:00.797 --> 24:04.005
We never know
when our third eye is opened.

24:05.713 --> 24:07.422
It's God's work.

24:09.838 --> 24:13.297
Since she was five years old,
Abel has had her third eye open.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.838
She got it from your grandmother.

24:19.922 --> 24:22.338
For those who have
their third eye open,

24:22.422 --> 24:24.838
it's not a pleasant experience.

24:25.463 --> 24:27.172
The other world is dark.

24:27.505 --> 24:30.255
There is pain, sadness,

24:30.338 --> 24:32.547
burden and anger.

24:34.088 --> 24:37.922
The bad energy is always able
to affect our senses and our mind.

24:39.588 --> 24:43.338
Guidance and adapting
is also needed for a long time

24:43.422 --> 24:46.588
to be able to live our lives normally.

24:48.588 --> 24:52.880
For all this time, Abel has been
coming here with your late mother.

24:55.255 --> 24:58.130
We've been discussing
all about the other world.

24:58.213 --> 25:00.672
Abel is able to accept herself

25:00.880 --> 25:03.130
even though she still feels afraid.

25:04.463 --> 25:06.463
But it is hard not to be afraid.

25:08.422 --> 25:09.422
Because they...

25:10.172 --> 25:14.005
are able to instill fear
that is unusual for us.

25:18.088 --> 25:22.422
I'm sorry, but I don't get any of this.

25:23.463 --> 25:24.588
Sis.

25:30.963 --> 25:31.963
Ma'am.

25:33.130 --> 25:36.505
You said that everyone is born
with a third eye.

25:37.922 --> 25:39.588
Which means I also have one?

25:41.130 --> 25:45.588
But mine is still closed
and not naturally open like Abel's.

25:50.838 --> 25:54.047
Can we... open it by force?

25:56.422 --> 25:57.588
Yes.

26:01.172 --> 26:03.130
Then I want my third eye to be opened.

26:10.172 --> 26:13.797
I don't want Abel to keep thinking
that I don't believe her.

26:14.672 --> 26:16.713
I always want to believe her.

26:17.255 --> 26:18.297
As long as there is proof.

26:21.505 --> 26:22.547
Bel.

26:23.255 --> 26:25.255
I want everything done quickly.

26:25.505 --> 26:29.047
We came all the way here to discuss this,
it shouldn't be for nothing.

26:29.713 --> 26:32.422
If you are right, I believe you.

26:33.047 --> 26:37.047
But if we open my third eye
and I don't see what you see,

26:37.130 --> 26:38.588
we're going to see the psychiatrist.

26:42.380 --> 26:43.713
Can we start?

26:45.130 --> 26:46.255
Alia.

26:46.755 --> 26:49.172
Opening the third eye takes
a lot of preparation.

26:49.255 --> 26:51.838
You have to be ready
physically and mentally.

26:52.297 --> 26:56.588
And you have to be ready to accept
everything you are going to experience.

27:04.338 --> 27:07.422
What has been opened
cannot be closed again.

27:08.088 --> 27:11.297
You will see everything, forever.

27:12.963 --> 27:15.838
You will be able to sense their presence.

27:16.422 --> 27:18.130
Smell them.

27:19.047 --> 27:20.588
And hear their voices.

27:29.672 --> 27:32.047
Put your arms over your chest.

27:39.088 --> 27:40.672
Close your eyes.

28:28.838 --> 28:30.213
Now, open your eyes.

29:19.172 --> 29:20.422
Nothing is different.

29:24.547 --> 29:25.755
We're going home.

29:26.213 --> 29:27.672
Excuse me.

29:28.130 --> 29:29.172
Sis!

29:37.255 --> 29:40.505
You need to believe me.

29:40.672 --> 29:42.922
Bu Windu has explained everything.

29:43.005 --> 29:46.005
-I can really see--
-Go to your room and have a rest.

29:46.088 --> 29:47.047
You're going to school tomorrow.

29:47.130 --> 29:48.797
Afterwards,
we're going to the psychiatrist.

29:56.755 --> 30:00.088
Sorry you had to witness all of this.

30:02.505 --> 30:04.172
It really makes me uncomfortable.

30:04.922 --> 30:07.838
It's really okay. I'm here for you.

30:16.505 --> 30:18.838
You'll be late getting to Bandung.

30:19.088 --> 30:21.005
Right. I'll get going.

30:22.088 --> 30:25.172
-Thanks for keeping me company.
-You're welcome.

30:26.797 --> 30:29.255
-Say hi to your dad for me.
-Of course.

30:37.172 --> 30:38.255
What is it?

31:40.713 --> 31:43.463
NURSING ROOM

31:53.755 --> 31:55.213
What's wrong?

31:56.297 --> 31:57.588
I don't know.

31:57.880 --> 32:01.880
I have bruises and my head is aching.
I'm about to get a checkup.

32:01.963 --> 32:02.922
How about you?

32:04.255 --> 32:05.797
Dad hit me.

32:07.505 --> 32:09.255
Do you have a dad?

32:10.422 --> 32:11.755
He passed away.

32:12.922 --> 32:15.297
Was he violent with you?

32:19.463 --> 32:21.463
Can you tell my mom

32:21.547 --> 32:23.713
I still love my dad.

32:24.422 --> 32:25.338
She is over there.

32:31.755 --> 32:33.005
Miss Alia?

32:36.338 --> 32:41.505
1ST FLOOR

32:41.755 --> 32:44.547
You're just too tired
and you need vitamins.

32:45.922 --> 32:47.380
I'll write a prescription for you.

32:48.672 --> 32:50.463
It's just vitamins.

32:53.047 --> 32:55.213
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

32:57.713 --> 33:02.297
GENERAL CLINIC

33:15.963 --> 33:20.505
PHARMACY

33:25.172 --> 33:26.463
Excuse me, Ma'am.

33:29.172 --> 33:30.672
Are you Tasha's mom?

33:35.422 --> 33:38.630
-Who are you?
-My name is Alia.

33:38.713 --> 33:42.547
I saw your daughter earlier,
and she asked me--

33:43.088 --> 33:45.880
She asked me to tell you...

33:46.130 --> 33:48.380
that she still loves her dad.

33:49.588 --> 33:50.630
Miss.

33:50.797 --> 33:53.088
Are you making fun of me?

33:54.338 --> 33:57.630
I'm sorry if I offended you,
but I thought you should know.

33:58.005 --> 34:00.463
My daughter passed away this morning.

34:02.630 --> 34:04.588
Please don't bother me.

34:05.380 --> 34:07.255
I am grieving.

34:22.588 --> 34:26.963
Excuse me, where is the little girl
who was sitting on that wheelchair?

34:29.838 --> 34:34.172
Over there, the one who talked to me
while I was waiting.

34:34.255 --> 34:37.005
You were sitting alone, Miss.
No one else was there.

35:02.088 --> 35:04.130
Abel, are you home?

35:04.297 --> 35:06.047
<i>I'm at the supermarket.</i>

35:06.838 --> 35:09.880
Come home now,
I need to tell you something.

35:09.963 --> 35:13.047
<i>-What is it?</i>
-Just come home now.

35:13.297 --> 35:14.463
<i>Sis?</i>

35:18.922 --> 35:20.630
How do you know

35:21.880 --> 35:23.838
if what you're seeing

35:24.547 --> 35:27.588
is a person or not?

35:29.297 --> 35:30.963
<i>What did you see?</i>

35:33.297 --> 35:36.005
I was talking to a little girl.

35:36.380 --> 35:39.380
But the nurse said she didn't see anyone.

35:39.922 --> 35:42.797
Her mother said she had passed away.

35:42.963 --> 35:45.088
But she talked to me, Bel.

35:45.172 --> 35:47.797
She was like a normal person.

35:48.172 --> 35:49.880
<i>You haven't seen more?</i>

35:51.630 --> 35:55.463
<i>Sometimes they look normal,</i>
<i>and we can't tell the difference.</i>

35:56.380 --> 35:58.422
<i>But a lot of them are...</i>

35:59.255 --> 36:00.255
<i>scary.</i>

36:00.755 --> 36:02.338
Come home now.

36:51.838 --> 36:55.088
Where are you going, kid?

37:27.547 --> 37:30.588
Excuse me, I need this medication.

37:31.422 --> 37:34.547
-All right, Miss. Just a second.
-Can you please hurry?

37:50.672 --> 37:53.672
LABORATORY

41:45.755 --> 41:47.463
Help.

41:59.380 --> 42:01.088
Help.

42:08.380 --> 42:12.005
Help.

42:12.088 --> 42:13.505
Help.

42:15.172 --> 42:16.588
Miss, what's wrong?

42:17.713 --> 42:21.297
-What's wrong with her?
-What happened?

42:21.380 --> 42:22.422
Miss!

42:22.505 --> 42:23.797
-Miss!
-What's wrong with her?

42:28.630 --> 42:29.838
Abel?

42:32.422 --> 42:33.672
Abel!

42:39.505 --> 42:40.338
Sis?

42:53.713 --> 42:56.797
They are everywhere.

42:57.130 --> 43:00.838
Not only in quiet places.
They can be in crowded places, too.

43:01.922 --> 43:04.755
I first saw them when I was at school.

43:05.588 --> 43:08.172
There are more of them
than there are of us.

43:08.380 --> 43:11.338
Because they live longer than us.

43:12.005 --> 43:14.547
Some of them
are even over a hundred years old.

43:17.130 --> 43:20.213
Sometimes, when they are around us,

43:20.297 --> 43:23.213
we feel uneasy, heavy.

43:23.297 --> 43:24.463
Our head starts aching.

43:24.547 --> 43:26.838
But sometimes it doesn't happen.

43:27.880 --> 43:31.672
Sometimes they smell pleasant,
sometimes they smell rotten.

43:33.047 --> 43:34.588
Why do they come?

43:35.880 --> 43:40.005
Bu Windu says it's because they have
unfinished business in this world.

43:41.047 --> 43:43.838
Some are nice, some are evil.

43:45.380 --> 43:48.005
Most of those who come to us ask for help.

43:48.797 --> 43:50.005
Help?

43:51.005 --> 43:53.963
To help them finish their business.

43:54.047 --> 43:57.213
They know who are able to see them
and help them.

43:59.463 --> 44:02.130
Bu Windu also said

44:02.213 --> 44:05.422
that we have to suppress our fear
when they come.

44:05.672 --> 44:08.047
And we have to ask them what they want.

44:08.505 --> 44:11.338
If we know what they want
and we can help,

44:11.422 --> 44:14.213
they will go back to where they should be.

44:14.588 --> 44:16.672
And they will leave us alone.

44:17.797 --> 44:19.297
Have you ever tried?

44:22.380 --> 44:24.005
I'm too scared.

44:44.380 --> 44:46.297
Sleep with me?

44:53.005 --> 44:54.005
Sis.

44:54.547 --> 44:57.172
Do you miss Mom and Dad?

45:02.463 --> 45:04.213
I really miss them.

45:04.755 --> 45:06.797
But we have to let it go.

45:06.880 --> 45:08.213
We have to be strong.

45:08.755 --> 45:10.630
Life must go on.

45:11.463 --> 45:15.088
Mom and Dad always taught us
to be independent.

45:16.755 --> 45:19.672
Thank you for not leaving me.

45:19.755 --> 45:22.047
You sacrificed a lot of things in Bangkok.

45:22.422 --> 45:24.380
It's okay.

45:24.797 --> 45:28.380
You are my only family in this world.

45:29.213 --> 45:33.463
It means
you're the most important thing to me.

45:37.172 --> 45:39.422
How long have you known Davin?

45:43.672 --> 45:48.422
We met about eight months ago
at a photography exhibition.

45:49.005 --> 45:53.338
But we started dating
about two months after that.

45:54.755 --> 45:56.297
He is a nice guy.

45:56.880 --> 45:58.172
He really is.

45:58.588 --> 46:00.213
Have you met his family?

46:00.797 --> 46:01.922
Not yet.

46:02.505 --> 46:04.797
His family lives in Bandung.

46:04.963 --> 46:08.047
His relationship with his family
isn't that good.

46:08.547 --> 46:12.463
So, I have a lot to work on
with our relationship.

46:16.005 --> 46:17.255
Do you want to use these?

46:19.297 --> 46:22.463
If you listen to music, you can feel calm.

46:22.547 --> 46:24.963
You won't hear
the weird noises that can come.

46:27.005 --> 46:28.630
You can wear them.

47:46.380 --> 47:47.588
Davin?

48:25.380 --> 48:26.797
Davin?

50:27.755 --> 50:31.963
<i>Riding a train</i>

50:32.047 --> 50:35.630
<i>Choo, choo, choo</i>

50:35.713 --> 50:40.672
<i>Who wants to get off?</i>

50:52.338 --> 50:56.172
Son, please stop playing.

50:57.255 --> 50:58.963
Get your dad.

50:59.047 --> 51:01.963
Let's have dinner.

51:24.963 --> 51:28.130
Dad, let's eat.

52:24.422 --> 52:26.922
Why are you here?

52:29.797 --> 52:31.963
What do you want?

52:33.588 --> 52:35.672
Do you need help?

52:37.713 --> 52:39.422
What?

52:40.755 --> 52:43.297
What can I help you with?

52:47.838 --> 52:50.797
House.

54:12.838 --> 54:13.838
Sis?

54:59.422 --> 55:03.088
<i>Riding a train</i>

55:03.713 --> 55:07.297
<i>Choo, choo, choo</i>

55:07.380 --> 55:12.505
<i>Who wants to get off?</i>

55:19.047 --> 55:21.088
Open.

55:23.172 --> 55:25.130
Open the door.

55:25.213 --> 55:26.130
Go away!

55:27.130 --> 55:29.088
Open!

55:47.588 --> 55:48.505
Sis!

56:03.172 --> 56:05.380
What you have witnessed
is just the beginning.

56:05.463 --> 56:07.463
Facing the other world

56:07.797 --> 56:10.297
means that you have to enter
their world completely.

56:11.338 --> 56:13.088
Not just seeing,

56:13.172 --> 56:15.630
but also experiencing the supernatural.

56:15.713 --> 56:17.005
Understanding their world.

56:17.755 --> 56:20.047
But they did this to me.

56:25.630 --> 56:27.255
There was a mother,

56:28.088 --> 56:29.297
a father,

56:29.380 --> 56:31.547
and a son who came to me.

56:32.047 --> 56:33.588
They smelled rotten.

56:35.338 --> 56:38.505
My head and body also felt heavy.

56:39.213 --> 56:40.547
They have shown themselves
more than once

56:40.630 --> 56:42.963
which means they have something to do.

56:43.297 --> 56:46.630
A rotten smell is the smell
of a spirit tainted with evil.

56:47.047 --> 56:49.922
Their negative energy
makes us uncomfortable.

56:50.797 --> 56:52.963
The bruise you have is proof

56:53.047 --> 56:54.922
that they tried to touch you.

57:01.088 --> 57:03.130
Have you asked what they wanted?

57:03.963 --> 57:05.213
They said...

57:06.755 --> 57:07.963
...house.

57:09.838 --> 57:13.172
House means two things, your bodies

57:13.922 --> 57:15.880
and the house that you are staying in.

57:16.297 --> 57:17.463
They want to possess you

57:17.547 --> 57:21.588
and use your bodies
to finish their business in this world.

57:22.088 --> 57:25.755
After that,
they will take you to their world

57:25.963 --> 57:30.505
as revenge for staying in their house.

57:31.422 --> 57:34.463
Their world is not a pleasant place
like heaven.

57:34.547 --> 57:36.172
It's something like hell.

57:37.505 --> 57:40.922
You will forever stay there with them.

58:03.630 --> 58:06.630
This is a detector.

58:08.672 --> 58:13.338
If it spins clockwise,
it shows positive energy.

58:15.005 --> 58:17.380
Anti-clockwise, negative energy.

58:20.922 --> 58:22.797
The smaller the movement...

58:23.755 --> 58:24.588
the smaller the energy.

58:26.047 --> 58:27.880
The bigger the movement...

58:28.880 --> 58:30.047
the bigger the energy.

58:51.005 --> 58:53.713
I cannot explore any further.

58:53.838 --> 58:57.088
Only the residents of this house
can communicate with them.

58:57.338 --> 58:58.505
You two.

58:58.963 --> 59:02.380
Because your energies
have known one another.

59:02.880 --> 59:04.463
But don't be afraid.

59:04.547 --> 59:09.213
The bad energy of the evil spirit
will only increase if you are afraid.

59:09.630 --> 59:12.672
Scared people are easier to possess.

59:15.505 --> 59:18.338
Abel!

59:18.588 --> 59:21.505
What Alia and Abel
are experiencing is real?

59:21.755 --> 59:23.713
I can't see anything.

59:24.880 --> 59:27.047
Those whose third eye is still closed

59:27.130 --> 59:29.047
cannot see anything.

59:29.880 --> 59:32.255
The spirits can see us, humans?

59:34.755 --> 59:37.797
Can they see each other?

59:38.297 --> 59:40.838
Some can, some cannot.

59:41.422 --> 59:46.088
Those who can't usually don't realize
they are dead.

59:47.047 --> 59:50.172
They always think they are still human.

59:55.297 --> 59:56.380
Abel.

59:57.713 --> 59:58.797
Hey.

1:00:00.963 --> 1:00:02.338
We have to try this.

1:00:02.422 --> 1:00:05.922
They are all bad energy. What for?

1:00:06.588 --> 1:00:08.838
Remember what Bu Windu told us.

1:00:09.172 --> 1:00:11.172
We have to have faith.

1:00:11.880 --> 1:00:14.380
We cannot lose to the fear they give us.

1:00:16.172 --> 1:00:18.672
They get stronger if we are weak.

1:00:18.755 --> 1:00:20.380
We have to fight them.

1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:25.172
You are no longer alone.

1:00:26.297 --> 1:00:29.547
We both have opened third eyes.

1:00:32.338 --> 1:00:33.713
I believe in you.

1:00:56.588 --> 1:00:59.172
Put your hands on the table
and hold each other's hands.

1:01:07.172 --> 1:01:08.838
Close your eyes and focus.

1:01:14.463 --> 1:01:17.338
Tell yourself that you want
to communicate with them.

1:01:17.422 --> 1:01:21.047
Unite your mind
to understand what they mean.

1:01:21.505 --> 1:01:24.088
But remember, stay within the boundaries.

1:01:24.172 --> 1:01:27.088
So you won't be affected
by their negative energy.

1:01:31.547 --> 1:01:37.463
Let yourself listen
to what they are trying to say.

1:01:47.047 --> 1:01:48.672
Do not open your eyes!

1:01:49.630 --> 1:01:53.963
Listen to what they are saying
and understand them.

1:02:16.422 --> 1:02:17.547
Davin?

1:02:18.463 --> 1:02:21.172
They do not want to talk with him.

1:03:33.130 --> 1:03:34.338
Hey, who are you?

1:03:34.422 --> 1:03:36.297
Quick, call the cops!

1:04:07.630 --> 1:04:12.297
Dad!

1:04:16.422 --> 1:04:18.172
Dad!

1:04:34.547 --> 1:04:36.130
They are a family.

1:04:37.505 --> 1:04:40.380
Mother, father, and son.

1:04:40.463 --> 1:04:41.463
The Sumarno family.

1:04:42.922 --> 1:04:44.505
They were robbed.

1:04:45.630 --> 1:04:47.880
And they were locked in
until they ran out of oxygen.

1:04:49.755 --> 1:04:53.130
This happened
before your parents bought this house.

1:04:53.213 --> 1:04:55.255
They lived here before that.

1:04:55.338 --> 1:04:58.672
They don't like you living in their house.

1:04:59.422 --> 1:05:01.880
They want you out of the house.

1:05:02.463 --> 1:05:04.463
They will keep bothering you,

1:05:04.547 --> 1:05:05.797
or...

1:05:06.463 --> 1:05:07.922
they will possess you

1:05:08.338 --> 1:05:11.005
to get revenge on the murderer.

1:05:12.963 --> 1:05:15.213
They have power over this house.

1:05:15.630 --> 1:05:19.213
If you stay here for too long,
it will be very dangerous.

1:05:22.838 --> 1:05:26.213
We inherited this house from our parents.

1:05:27.047 --> 1:05:29.172
This is our only house.

1:05:30.422 --> 1:05:33.380
I don't have enough money
to get out of this house either.

1:05:34.755 --> 1:05:36.130
Is there any other way?

1:05:36.213 --> 1:05:40.630
We can get them to go to their own world.

1:05:41.213 --> 1:05:46.047
But we have to do a ritual
to open the portal to their new world.

1:05:48.630 --> 1:05:49.463
Davin.

1:05:51.422 --> 1:05:54.505
You cannot be here
until everything is over.

1:05:54.880 --> 1:05:56.922
It will be too dangerous for you.

1:06:22.297 --> 1:06:23.630
Let's hold hands.

1:06:28.130 --> 1:06:29.422
We will try to open the portal.

1:06:30.172 --> 1:06:31.963
Close your eyes and focus.

1:06:51.797 --> 1:06:53.755
The portal isn't open yet.

1:06:55.963 --> 1:06:58.380
Let's try again and focus.

1:06:59.088 --> 1:07:00.422
Close your eyes.

1:07:17.672 --> 1:07:19.797
Sis? Sis!

1:07:20.797 --> 1:07:21.922
Ma'am.

1:07:23.922 --> 1:07:26.130
I don't see them here.

1:07:27.505 --> 1:07:29.088
Where are they?

1:09:09.505 --> 1:09:13.713
Sis!

1:09:13.797 --> 1:09:14.922
Alia!

1:09:15.297 --> 1:09:16.130
Sis.

1:09:21.088 --> 1:09:22.213
Alia!

1:09:22.297 --> 1:09:26.172
Alia, let go!

1:09:37.797 --> 1:09:39.922
Abel! Abel, wake up!

1:09:43.047 --> 1:09:44.380
Abel, get the rope!

1:10:05.755 --> 1:10:06.922
Alia is possessed.

1:10:10.463 --> 1:10:13.088
Humans.

1:10:16.255 --> 1:10:17.922
Bu Windu.

1:10:18.922 --> 1:10:22.797
They can possess an empty mind.
Don't leave your mind empty.

1:10:23.005 --> 1:10:26.630
Alia was too focused on you,
that's why she was possessed.

1:10:28.047 --> 1:10:29.630
Come here.

1:10:30.172 --> 1:10:31.672
Come here, you.

1:10:31.755 --> 1:10:33.338
Come here!

1:10:36.547 --> 1:10:38.713
Want to get us out of this body?

1:10:38.880 --> 1:10:40.755
Want to send us away?

1:10:41.338 --> 1:10:43.713
Your place is not in our world!

1:10:45.380 --> 1:10:49.380
Then try. Try!

1:11:01.088 --> 1:11:03.880
Hold hands. Let's hold hands!

1:11:34.297 --> 1:11:35.338
Keep holding hands!

1:12:51.880 --> 1:12:53.463
Do you know that man?

1:12:54.213 --> 1:12:55.047
Mang Asep.

1:12:56.505 --> 1:12:58.213
He is our gardener.

1:13:59.713 --> 1:14:02.005
Abel, hold Alia!

1:14:02.172 --> 1:14:03.588
Don't let go!

1:14:04.713 --> 1:14:07.963
Alia!

1:14:23.172 --> 1:14:25.422
Alia! Abel, hurry!

1:14:28.088 --> 1:14:29.630
-Alia!
-Sis!

1:14:29.713 --> 1:14:31.755
Alia is going to find Mang Asep
and kill him.

1:14:31.838 --> 1:14:33.130
We have to stop her!

1:15:02.797 --> 1:15:04.005
Alia!

1:15:04.422 --> 1:15:05.630
Alia!

1:15:06.297 --> 1:15:10.172
-Sis!
-Alia!

1:15:10.255 --> 1:15:14.047
-Sis!
-Abel, go through the back door!

1:15:29.505 --> 1:15:31.297
I'm going to go outside for a while.

1:15:31.380 --> 1:15:33.672
-Okay, don't take too long.
-Okay.

1:15:33.755 --> 1:15:35.797
-Come home soon.
-All right.

1:16:32.172 --> 1:16:35.172
Neng Alia? What brings you here tonight?

1:16:35.880 --> 1:16:38.130
Sorry, the light is broken.

1:16:40.547 --> 1:16:41.797
Neng Alia?

1:17:30.963 --> 1:17:31.797
Neng Alia!

1:17:32.630 --> 1:17:34.588
Neng Alia who?

1:17:36.463 --> 1:17:38.130
Remember us?

1:17:38.755 --> 1:17:40.213
The Sumarno family!

1:17:41.005 --> 1:17:43.505
Remember what you did to us?

1:17:44.213 --> 1:17:46.630
What have you been doing?
My garden is a mess!

1:17:46.713 --> 1:17:48.588
My wife's flowers are dead!

1:17:49.005 --> 1:17:50.630
What kind of fertilizer did you use?

1:17:50.713 --> 1:17:54.672
I'm sorry, Sir.
I used the one that you gave me.

1:17:54.755 --> 1:17:57.213
You must have used it wrong, right?

1:17:57.963 --> 1:17:59.297
Can you even do your job?

1:17:59.380 --> 1:18:00.380
My wife,

1:18:00.880 --> 1:18:02.422
you can relax.

1:18:02.797 --> 1:18:04.547
I will receive my salary tomorrow.

1:18:05.047 --> 1:18:07.588
It can be used for your surgery.

1:18:09.547 --> 1:18:12.755
But after our child is born,

1:18:12.922 --> 1:18:15.172
we'll need even more money.

1:18:16.338 --> 1:18:19.338
Our child's heart isn't normal.

1:18:21.922 --> 1:18:24.338
There has to be a way.

1:18:24.422 --> 1:18:27.630
-Salary?
-Yes, Sir, it is due.

1:18:27.797 --> 1:18:30.088
Sir, please.

1:18:30.963 --> 1:18:33.380
I have tried my best in my work.

1:18:33.463 --> 1:18:36.922
If I made any mistakes, I apologize.

1:18:37.005 --> 1:18:38.755
I will improve, but for now, please.

1:18:38.838 --> 1:18:42.213
My wife is about to give birth.
Please, Sir.

1:18:42.297 --> 1:18:44.213
-You can't even do your job!
-Sir, please.

1:18:44.297 --> 1:18:46.380
You're asking for money? In your dreams!

1:18:46.463 --> 1:18:48.213
-Please, Sir.
-Get out of my way!

1:18:55.463 --> 1:18:56.713
Hey, who are you?

1:18:56.797 --> 1:18:58.713
-Quick, call the cops!
-Honey!

1:19:24.463 --> 1:19:26.422
Mang Asep.

1:19:27.463 --> 1:19:30.255
-Does it hurt?
-I'm sorry!

1:19:30.422 --> 1:19:36.713
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to kill anyone!

1:19:36.797 --> 1:19:38.630
I'm sorry!

1:19:39.505 --> 1:19:41.755
No, don't! I'm sorry!

1:19:41.838 --> 1:19:46.338
Don't! Forgive me! No!

1:19:46.422 --> 1:19:49.922
Don't!

1:19:52.047 --> 1:19:53.213
Don't!

1:20:16.422 --> 1:20:17.505
Alia!

1:20:25.463 --> 1:20:28.172
-Sis!
-Alia!

1:20:30.588 --> 1:20:32.880
Don't, sis!

1:20:35.088 --> 1:20:35.922
Don't!

1:20:48.880 --> 1:20:50.005
Sis!

1:20:52.338 --> 1:20:53.297
Sis!

1:20:53.380 --> 1:20:54.463
Move!

1:21:29.713 --> 1:21:30.672
Abel!

1:21:36.630 --> 1:21:37.880
Alia!

1:21:50.213 --> 1:21:52.755
Alia!

1:21:57.338 --> 1:21:58.380
Abel.

1:21:58.505 --> 1:22:00.672
Abel? Abel!

1:22:02.380 --> 1:22:03.463
Abel.

1:22:03.880 --> 1:22:05.088
Abel?

1:22:05.797 --> 1:22:08.588
Abel? Abel, wake up! Abel.

1:22:09.297 --> 1:22:13.297
They couldn't take you with them,
so they're taking Abel.

1:22:13.463 --> 1:22:14.880
Abel is more afraid than you,

1:22:14.963 --> 1:22:18.005
she is easier for them
to take to their world.

1:22:18.172 --> 1:22:19.922
They don't want to lose that easily.

1:22:20.172 --> 1:22:22.213
They always want to win.

1:22:23.005 --> 1:22:24.338
Abel!

1:22:27.505 --> 1:22:30.547
Abel's spirit is now
with the evil spirits.

1:22:30.630 --> 1:22:32.672
-Forever.
-Abel!

1:22:42.172 --> 1:22:43.880
She is still holding on.

1:22:43.963 --> 1:22:46.547
She has a strong will to stay with us.

1:22:47.963 --> 1:22:49.880
When is she going to recover?

1:22:51.130 --> 1:22:53.380
Her condition will drop in time.

1:22:54.088 --> 1:22:56.755
There must be a way for her to come back.

1:22:57.463 --> 1:23:00.755
She can come back
if someone goes to pick her up.

1:23:02.047 --> 1:23:04.505
You mean, to the other world?

1:23:07.130 --> 1:23:08.547
Astral projection.

1:23:10.005 --> 1:23:11.963
Can you bring her home?

1:23:13.255 --> 1:23:15.088
I have to guard the gate,

1:23:15.172 --> 1:23:17.797
so they don't come into our world again.

1:23:22.505 --> 1:23:24.630
Then I will bring her home.

1:23:26.130 --> 1:23:29.213
Whoever goes there
will never come back home.

1:23:30.297 --> 1:23:33.880
Unless accompanied
by an entity that is like them.

1:23:34.463 --> 1:23:36.130
Someone not human.

1:23:44.338 --> 1:23:46.880
Alia, haven't you realized?

1:24:17.922 --> 1:24:19.297
Abel, what happened to you?

1:24:19.380 --> 1:24:22.380
Ma'am, she said she is afraid.

1:24:22.463 --> 1:24:26.088
She said she sees something over there.

1:24:30.922 --> 1:24:32.130
Nothing.

1:24:32.547 --> 1:24:35.213
There is nothing. What did you see, honey?

1:24:35.297 --> 1:24:40.963
Don't be scared, sweetie,
Mommy is here. It's okay.

1:24:41.047 --> 1:24:44.797
Calm down, sweetie.
Mommy is here. It's okay.

1:24:44.880 --> 1:24:46.755
Calm down, honey.

1:24:46.838 --> 1:24:47.922
Alia?

1:24:48.922 --> 1:24:51.380
What's wrong? What did you see?

1:24:54.172 --> 1:24:55.380
Nothing, Mom.

1:24:55.588 --> 1:24:56.797
I think my eyes tricked me.

1:24:58.963 --> 1:25:02.380
Abel, calm down, sweetie.

1:25:04.338 --> 1:25:06.047
What about her sister?

1:25:07.963 --> 1:25:09.630
She isn't like Abel.

1:25:09.713 --> 1:25:11.630
She doesn't realize her ability.

1:25:11.713 --> 1:25:13.630
A brave person is usually like that.

1:25:13.963 --> 1:25:16.130
-But we must tell her.
-No!

1:25:16.213 --> 1:25:17.588
I don't want her to know.

1:25:17.672 --> 1:25:20.630
I don't want her to be afraid,
even more than Abel.

1:25:20.713 --> 1:25:22.213
I can't bear to.

1:25:32.713 --> 1:25:35.797
Her third eye is already opened.
What are you doing this for?

1:25:35.880 --> 1:25:39.547
To enhance her sensitivity.

1:25:45.963 --> 1:25:49.963
A closed third eye
is like a window with a curtain.

1:25:50.505 --> 1:25:53.547
Since you were little,
your curtain has been opened halfway.

1:25:53.630 --> 1:25:55.672
I helped you open the remaining half.

1:25:57.713 --> 1:26:00.213
Before I opened it completely,

1:26:00.380 --> 1:26:03.213
you have been in encounters
with several of them.

1:26:04.463 --> 1:26:06.547
Some of them are even friends with you.

1:26:07.672 --> 1:26:10.422
A good friend that can accompany you

1:26:10.505 --> 1:26:13.255
and bring Abel home.

1:26:15.463 --> 1:26:17.588
Would you accompany Alia?

1:26:38.213 --> 1:26:41.255
<i>Davin, come home, see your dad.</i>

1:26:41.588 --> 1:26:43.047
<i>It's been four years.</i>

1:26:43.130 --> 1:26:47.088
<i>How long are going to oppose his marriage?</i>

1:26:47.172 --> 1:26:51.213
<i>Vin, your father has never forgotten</i>
<i>about your mother.</i>

1:26:51.297 --> 1:26:53.838
<i>But he needs a life partner.</i>

1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:43.047
<i>Those who can't see</i>
<i>they are not aware that they are dead.</i>

1:27:43.130 --> 1:27:45.380
<i>They still think that they are human.</i>

1:27:53.047 --> 1:27:56.630
<i>Those who are unaware</i>
<i>that they are different</i>

1:27:56.713 --> 1:27:59.422
<i>can still touch people, like normal.</i>

1:27:59.505 --> 1:28:03.880
<i>Unlike those who already know</i>
<i>that they are dead.</i>

1:28:24.963 --> 1:28:27.797
No, thanks. I'm almost done.

1:28:29.672 --> 1:28:31.172
How long have you been here?

1:28:32.505 --> 1:28:33.797
Twenty minutes?

1:28:38.922 --> 1:28:40.797
Quit it, Davin!

1:28:45.588 --> 1:28:49.672
There is something in this world
that is keeping you here.

1:28:50.130 --> 1:28:51.963
But now it is all done, right?

1:28:52.922 --> 1:28:54.505
You have met your father.

1:29:00.755 --> 1:29:02.880
<i>He has let you go, too.</i>

1:29:02.963 --> 1:29:06.005
<i>When you talk to someone who is sleeping,</i>

1:29:06.088 --> 1:29:08.338
<i>they can hear you in their dreams.</i>

1:29:15.255 --> 1:29:19.213
Now you just need
to say goodbye to someone.

1:29:21.172 --> 1:29:22.838
We don't have much time.

1:29:36.630 --> 1:29:38.838
Do me a favor, okay?

1:29:43.505 --> 1:29:45.130
Let me go.

1:29:46.588 --> 1:29:50.255
Remember Abel. She has to come back.

1:29:52.547 --> 1:29:53.672
Bu Windu.

1:29:53.963 --> 1:29:57.380
If Alia goes there alone,
it is too dangerous.

1:29:57.463 --> 1:29:59.547
Let me go there alone.

1:30:01.047 --> 1:30:04.880
Those who are dead
cannot bring the living back home.

1:30:05.130 --> 1:30:06.588
Only the living can.

1:30:07.130 --> 1:30:10.797
You just need to accompany her
so your energy can become one.

1:30:11.505 --> 1:30:13.422
They will not recognize Alia

1:30:13.505 --> 1:30:15.963
because they will be distracted
by your energy.

1:30:16.255 --> 1:30:17.463
But remember.

1:30:17.630 --> 1:30:20.838
When you take Abel and Alia
to the road back home,

1:30:21.338 --> 1:30:24.463
at the intersection,
choose the tunnel with the light.

1:30:24.588 --> 1:30:27.713
Your place is in a pleasant world,
not with the evil.

1:30:44.213 --> 1:30:47.797
You have to hold hands,
to be one energy. Don't let go.

1:30:47.880 --> 1:30:50.463
Or else, they will recognize Alia,
capture her,

1:30:50.547 --> 1:30:53.047
and she will be stranded there.

1:30:54.380 --> 1:30:55.797
Hold hands.

1:30:56.088 --> 1:30:57.547
Close your eyes.

1:31:41.213 --> 1:31:43.130
Hey, are you okay?

1:31:47.172 --> 1:31:49.088
That's your way out.

1:31:51.088 --> 1:31:53.297
And that is yours.

1:31:54.047 --> 1:31:55.713
To a better place.

1:31:58.255 --> 1:31:59.713
We have to be strong.

1:32:00.213 --> 1:32:02.172
Let's mark the exit.

1:32:11.547 --> 1:32:13.672
Now where do we go?

1:32:15.505 --> 1:32:16.922
Bu Windu said...

1:32:17.880 --> 1:32:21.755
the spirits who cannot rest
go to darker places.

1:34:44.963 --> 1:34:50.463
<i>Riding a train</i>

1:34:50.547 --> 1:34:54.963
<i>Choo, choo, choo</i>

1:34:55.047 --> 1:35:01.922
<i>Who wants to get off?</i>

1:35:02.630 --> 1:35:09.422
<i>To Bandung, Surabaya</i>

1:35:10.338 --> 1:35:17.338
<i>You may ride for free</i>

1:35:19.380 --> 1:35:26.380
<i>Come on, friend, let's hop on</i>

1:35:26.630 --> 1:35:33.630
<i>The train doesn't stop for long</i>

1:36:08.755 --> 1:36:10.005
-Abel!
-Abel.

1:36:12.172 --> 1:36:14.463
Abel.

1:36:14.547 --> 1:36:15.380
Move.

1:36:25.213 --> 1:36:26.213
Sis!

1:36:28.380 --> 1:36:30.047
Abel, are you okay?

1:36:30.255 --> 1:36:33.463
Who put you here? The Sumarno family?

1:36:34.547 --> 1:36:35.838
Who?

1:36:35.922 --> 1:36:39.422
He doesn't want me, he wants you here!

1:36:40.047 --> 1:36:41.380
Who?

1:37:03.922 --> 1:37:05.172
Hold my hand!

1:37:05.255 --> 1:37:06.255
Hold my hand! Alia, hold Abel's hand!

1:37:40.422 --> 1:37:43.463
Don't let go, they won't know who you are.

1:39:06.297 --> 1:39:07.463
That's the mark, let's go!

1:39:26.963 --> 1:39:28.463
Run!

1:39:33.713 --> 1:39:35.255
Abel, you go first.

1:39:37.588 --> 1:39:38.588
Go on!

1:39:58.380 --> 1:40:00.838
Will we ever meet again?

1:40:01.297 --> 1:40:03.338
You have a long life ahead of you.

1:40:03.422 --> 1:40:07.172
You will meet more people.

1:40:07.380 --> 1:40:09.255
You will have a new love.

1:40:09.838 --> 1:40:12.463
I will never forget you.

1:40:14.005 --> 1:40:16.422
I will never forget you either, forever.

1:41:09.838 --> 1:41:11.088
Sis.

1:41:19.005 --> 1:41:20.672
I know that it's difficult.

1:41:21.505 --> 1:41:23.255
But if we love someone,

1:41:24.838 --> 1:41:26.505
we have to let them go.

1:41:27.672 --> 1:41:29.755
<i>Not for our sake.</i>

1:41:29.838 --> 1:41:31.755
<i>But for them.</i>

1:41:32.213 --> 1:41:34.130
<i>Even if it hurts you.</i>

1:41:49.463 --> 1:41:52.797
TWO WEEKS LATER

1:42:19.755 --> 1:42:22.630
<i>I met two of them this month</i>
<i>at the office.</i>

1:42:24.422 --> 1:42:26.297
A man and a woman.

1:42:27.880 --> 1:42:29.588
They didn't do anything.

1:42:30.380 --> 1:42:32.380
They just observed me.

1:42:32.713 --> 1:42:34.422
On and on.

1:42:35.880 --> 1:42:38.755
I still cannot understand what they want.

1:42:41.297 --> 1:42:42.797
How about the one at your school?

1:42:44.547 --> 1:42:46.213
She followed me home.

1:42:46.297 --> 1:42:48.713
I told her not to enter the house.

1:42:49.380 --> 1:42:52.213
But earlier this morning,
she went inside and turned on the shower.

1:42:52.630 --> 1:42:54.922
She has been staying at the tree
next to the house for a couple of days.

1:42:57.755 --> 1:43:00.963
It's natural for them to bother people.

1:43:01.047 --> 1:43:03.255
But you have to be careful.

1:43:03.672 --> 1:43:05.838
They might have a hidden agenda.

1:43:07.505 --> 1:43:09.297
She doesn't smell rotten, though.

1:43:09.838 --> 1:43:10.797
What does she look like?

1:43:11.130 --> 1:43:12.797
She has a hole on her back.

1:43:13.088 --> 1:43:14.547
Have you asked her name?

1:43:15.672 --> 1:43:16.755
Her name is Mirah.

1:43:17.213 --> 1:43:19.463
<i>You should try asking her.</i>

1:43:19.547 --> 1:43:21.463
<i>She might need help.</i>

1:43:22.838 --> 1:43:26.838
<i>Why did God give us this ability?</i>

1:43:27.338 --> 1:43:28.380
<i>It is his secret.</i>

1:43:29.213 --> 1:43:32.505
<i>Whatever God gives to us,</i>

1:43:32.588 --> 1:43:37.047
<i>good or bad,</i>
<i>we have to accept it wholeheartedly.</i>

1:43:37.338 --> 1:43:39.255
<i>We even have to be grateful.</i>

1:43:39.338 --> 1:43:40.838
<i>Because with it,</i>

1:43:40.922 --> 1:43:44.922
<i>we are able to live our lives</i>
<i>without burden.</i>

1:43:45.172 --> 1:43:49.088
<i>Those of us with opened third eyes</i>
<i>are here for them.</i>

1:43:54.338 --> 1:43:55.422
What's wrong?

1:43:58.130 --> 1:44:00.963
Why didn't you tell me?

1:44:01.047 --> 1:44:02.463
About Davin.

1:44:03.630 --> 1:44:06.588
If I told you earlier,
would you have believed me?

1:44:18.630 --> 1:44:19.588
Who is it?

1:45:04.380 --> 1:45:05.505
Mirah?

1:45:09.630 --> 1:45:11.713
Did you follow Abel home?

1:45:15.630 --> 1:45:17.088
What do you want?
