WEBVTT

00:08.660 --> 00:11.663
-He should be here any minute
-What?

00:12.055 --> 00:14.014
What do I do?

00:14.057 --> 00:16.494
All right.
You stay here.

00:16.538 --> 00:19.367
Special Agent Gibbs?

00:19.410 --> 00:21.021
Thanks for coming.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.631
Alan Katzenbach.

00:22.674 --> 00:25.329
Hi. On the phone, you said this
concerned national security.

00:25.373 --> 00:28.289
Yeah. I represent
Chief Petty Officer Wiley,

00:28.332 --> 00:30.943
who's about to be arraigned
for possession of narcotics.

00:30.987 --> 00:34.034
He has sensitive information
he would like to trade.

00:34.077 --> 00:36.601
We want you to help us
with a plea bargain.

00:36.645 --> 00:38.125
Okay. I'm listening.

00:38.168 --> 00:41.650
All I know is it involves an
arms dealer named Agah Bayar.

00:45.001 --> 00:47.438
Let's talk.

00:50.224 --> 00:52.313
[gasping]

00:52.356 --> 00:53.662
I don't think
I can do this.

00:53.705 --> 00:54.793
Yes, you can.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.230
[groaning]Are-Are you okay?

00:56.273 --> 00:57.753
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

00:57.796 --> 00:59.102
Call 911!

00:59.146 --> 01:01.539
Code 12.
Code 12.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.976
Come on, man!
Breathe!

01:41.971 --> 01:44.104
Doc, what are you doing?

01:44.147 --> 01:48.978
Trying to find a wedding present
for Mr. Palmer and his bride.

01:49.021 --> 01:50.110
Where is he?

01:50.153 --> 01:53.156
Breena called,
summoning him to approve

01:53.200 --> 01:55.419
the wedding font
for the invitation.

01:55.463 --> 01:58.683
I was taking advantage
of his absence to select

01:58.727 --> 02:01.077
a suitable gift
from their registry.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.601
I find this whole
online process

02:03.645 --> 02:05.168
rather distasteful.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.648
They tell you
what to buy for them,

02:06.691 --> 02:08.128
you click a few buttons.

02:08.171 --> 02:09.868
It's gift wrapped,
packed, shipped.

02:09.912 --> 02:11.000
You don't do anything.

02:11.043 --> 02:12.262
It's so distasteful.

02:12.306 --> 02:15.483
What are you sending them?

02:15.526 --> 02:17.833
His death
drug-related, Doc?

02:17.876 --> 02:19.835
Uh... n-no.

02:19.878 --> 02:23.708
Uh, the death certificate will
read, "ventricular tachycardia,"

02:23.752 --> 02:25.710
extreme and rapid
heartbeat.

02:25.754 --> 02:27.930
He's a little young
for that, isn't he?Actually, no.

02:27.973 --> 02:33.588
Almost 10% of heart attacks in
men occur before the age of 45.

02:33.631 --> 02:36.286
Almost 80% from coronary
heart disease.

02:36.330 --> 02:39.811
However, that is not the case
with our petty officer.

02:39.855 --> 02:44.555
Two years ago, he was
diagnosed with bradycardia,

02:44.599 --> 02:46.078
a slow heartbeat.

02:46.122 --> 02:47.254
This pacemaker

02:47.297 --> 02:52.041
was installed
to control that condition.

02:52.084 --> 02:54.130
He was diagnosed
with a slow heartbeat,

02:54.174 --> 02:56.045
and he died
from a rapid heartbeat?

02:56.088 --> 02:57.655
Yeah, strange, isn't it?

02:57.699 --> 03:00.223
That's why I'm going to
have Abby run tests

03:00.267 --> 03:01.833
on this little device,

03:01.877 --> 03:05.707
to see whether
it malfunctioned.

03:07.839 --> 03:09.580
[elevator bell chimes]

03:09.624 --> 03:11.669
Morning, ladies.

03:14.368 --> 03:15.804
McGee...

03:19.199 --> 03:20.374
What's Ziva doing?

03:20.417 --> 03:22.332
Memorizing her speech.

03:22.376 --> 03:24.247
Speech?!Director Vance
volunteered her

03:24.291 --> 03:26.336
to speak at
a high school career day.

03:26.380 --> 03:27.816
In what language, Vulcan?

03:27.859 --> 03:28.817
[laughs]

03:28.860 --> 03:29.818
[Ziva laughs]

03:29.861 --> 03:31.254
I can hear you, Tony.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.560
I do not need you
making this worse.

03:32.603 --> 03:34.649
Back up.I think you mean
"back off," Ziva.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.781
Oh!

03:36.825 --> 03:38.435
Why are you
so uptight, Ziva?

03:38.479 --> 03:39.828
Public speaking's not my...

03:39.871 --> 03:41.046
thing.

03:41.090 --> 03:42.396
Makes me nervous.

03:42.439 --> 03:43.788
Nervous?
What are you talking about?

03:43.832 --> 03:45.660
I've seen you take down
armed terrorists

03:45.703 --> 03:46.617
without breaking a sweat.

03:46.661 --> 03:47.749
I'm trained for that.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.098
[scoffs]

03:49.141 --> 03:50.447
Hey, Dornaget!

03:50.491 --> 03:51.840
Where you been hiding?

03:51.883 --> 03:52.971
Uh, I've been working

03:53.015 --> 03:54.625
as an alternate
evidence custodian.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.714
Ouch.Yeah, I hate it.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.716
Any advice on how
I can get into the field?

03:58.760 --> 04:00.022
All in due time.

04:00.065 --> 04:02.677
You are not ready yet,
my little grasshopper.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.113
What brings you up here?

04:04.156 --> 04:05.984
Uh, we don't have
a signature card on file

04:06.028 --> 04:08.813
in the evidence locker for
Special Agent DiNozzo.

04:08.857 --> 04:11.512
TONY: What are you
talking about?

04:11.555 --> 04:13.296
I signed one of these
things years ago.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.777
Well, it's probably
just an oversight,

04:15.820 --> 04:17.866
but we don't
have it, so...

04:17.909 --> 04:20.738
So... that's your problem.

04:20.782 --> 04:21.826
Please...

04:21.870 --> 04:23.698
Agent DiNozzo?Special...

04:23.741 --> 04:24.786
Agent DiNozzo.

04:24.829 --> 04:25.787
And, first,
you're gonna explain

04:25.830 --> 04:26.962
what happened to
the original, huh?

04:27.005 --> 04:27.963
McGEE:
You know what?

04:28.006 --> 04:29.181
Let me see that.

04:32.054 --> 04:34.796
No, it needs to be
Special Agent DiNozzo.

04:36.537 --> 04:37.712
It is.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.627
Wait a second.

04:40.628 --> 04:41.890
Wow, that's dead-on.

04:41.933 --> 04:43.065
He forged my signature
perfectly.

04:43.108 --> 04:45.023
Duh. He's been
doing it for years.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.898
I don't know
if I can use this... Ow.

04:49.941 --> 04:52.509
Hi, boss.It'll be fine.

04:52.553 --> 04:55.077
TONY: Talked to Wiley's C.O.
at the Naval Research Lab, boss.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.513
He had top secret clearance.

04:56.557 --> 04:58.646
They've locked down
his workstation and computer

04:58.689 --> 05:00.212
and are conducting
a damage assessment.

05:00.256 --> 05:02.737
McGee, were you able to
connect him to Agah Bayar?

05:02.780 --> 05:04.129
Not yet, boss.[phone ringing]

05:04.173 --> 05:05.696
I need to find out
what Wiley was gonna tell us.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.307
[Abbey speaks indistinctly
over phone]

05:07.350 --> 05:08.308
Yeah, Abbs.

05:08.351 --> 05:09.961
Yep, on my way down.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.487
What took you so long?

05:13.530 --> 05:14.879
What do you got, Abbs?

05:14.923 --> 05:16.228
Wiley didn't have
a heart attack.

05:16.272 --> 05:17.969
I mean, he did have a heart
attack, but he didn't.

05:18.013 --> 05:19.275
He was given
a heart attack.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.407
You're not
making any sense.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.017
Okay.

05:22.060 --> 05:24.889
His pacemaker
is Internet addressable,

05:24.933 --> 05:27.327
so a doctor can monitor
and control their

05:27.370 --> 05:29.416
patient's heart
functions 24/7.

05:29.459 --> 05:30.895
Somebody hacked
into this puppy

05:30.939 --> 05:32.419
and changed
Wiley's heart rate.

05:32.462 --> 05:35.509
60 to 100 beats
per minute is normal.

05:35.552 --> 05:39.121
His ticker was cranked
up to 400 before he died.

05:39.164 --> 05:42.429
Gibbs somebody murdered
Wiley by remote control.

05:51.829 --> 05:53.396
ZIVA:
Chief Petty Officer Wiley

05:53.440 --> 05:55.398
enlisted in the Navy
after high school.

05:55.442 --> 05:56.921
He was an
Operations Specialist

05:56.965 --> 06:00.316
aboard the nuclear
submarine USS Lafayette.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.448
After he got
the pacemaker,

06:01.491 --> 06:03.232
he was no longer
qualified for sea duty.

06:03.275 --> 06:05.843
But his top secret clearance
led to his billet

06:05.887 --> 06:07.192
at the Naval Research
Laboratory.

06:07.236 --> 06:09.281
Family?
Never married,

06:09.325 --> 06:11.849
parents deceased,
one sister living in Phoenix.

06:11.893 --> 06:13.329
TONY:
Traffic sucks.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.548
And I had to wait for Wiley's

06:14.591 --> 06:16.288
cardiologist to finish surgery.

06:16.332 --> 06:17.289
What'd he say?

06:17.333 --> 06:18.421
Well, he was shocked.

06:18.465 --> 06:19.814
He said Wiley was in
two weeks ago

06:19.857 --> 06:22.120
for a regular heart exam,
and things were A-OK.

06:22.164 --> 06:24.209
GIBBS: The doctor or anyone in
his office access the pacemaker?

06:24.253 --> 06:27.256
Uh, he assured us
no one had, uh,

06:27.299 --> 06:28.388
at the time of death.

06:28.431 --> 06:29.432
You believe him?

06:29.476 --> 06:30.868
Yeah, yeah.

06:30.912 --> 06:33.088
He, uh, showed me
the monitor logs.

06:33.131 --> 06:36.265
Check out Wiley's
apartment.
Mm-hmm.

06:36.308 --> 06:38.223
Find me something that
connect him to Agah Bayar.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.791
On it, boss.

06:44.316 --> 06:47.276
"I am most sure you can
see from my accent..."Hey, hey!

06:47.319 --> 06:49.278
Hey, give it!

06:49.321 --> 06:50.061
Aah! Paper cut.

06:51.628 --> 06:53.456
You really gonna say that
to a bunch of high school kids?

06:53.500 --> 06:54.326
I know what you're doing.

06:54.370 --> 06:55.676
You can mess with Dornaget,

06:55.719 --> 06:57.939
but you're not getting
inside myhead.

07:08.950 --> 07:12.344
I would love to take this
S.O.B. out of circulation.

07:12.388 --> 07:13.955
Yeah, me, too.

07:13.998 --> 07:15.478
He's really slick.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.262
And he's smart.

07:17.306 --> 07:19.917
He's just legitimate enough
to cover the jobs that aren't.

07:19.961 --> 07:22.050
He's got
good instincts.

07:22.093 --> 07:23.747
He knows when to walk away.

07:23.791 --> 07:25.488
[grunts]

07:29.536 --> 07:32.669
Any idea what the dead petty
officer was trying to tell you?

07:32.713 --> 07:34.236
No.

07:34.279 --> 07:35.411
Not yet.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.239
Got his lawyer
coming in here.

07:37.282 --> 07:38.849
He was too shaken
at the courthouse.

07:38.893 --> 07:41.199
I was hoping I could
get him in here

07:41.243 --> 07:43.027
and squeeze something
out of him.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.594
I put in a call
to my counterparts--

07:44.638 --> 07:47.945
FBI, CIA, DIA--
trying to see

07:47.989 --> 07:49.338
if any of them
were tracking Agah Bayar.

07:49.381 --> 07:50.513
What'd they say?

07:50.557 --> 07:52.167
It's what they didn't say.

07:52.210 --> 07:53.734
I got a feeling
I was stonewalled.

07:53.777 --> 07:54.778
Something's up.

07:54.822 --> 07:56.301
They just weren't
in a sharing mood.

07:56.345 --> 07:58.347
DIA didn't even
return my call.

07:58.390 --> 08:00.218
Ah, hell, Leon,
that's just us.

08:00.262 --> 08:01.611
We're still fighting
for respect.
Yeah.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.308
You know, I envy you, Gibbs.

08:03.352 --> 08:06.964
You don't have to put up
with the politics.

08:07.008 --> 08:08.749
When I get the boot or...

08:08.792 --> 08:12.100
drop dead in this chair,
don't take the job.

08:12.143 --> 08:13.536
[laughs]

08:13.580 --> 08:15.320
Hear you loud and clear.

08:15.364 --> 08:17.975
Oh, kids are growing up
way too fast.

08:20.238 --> 08:22.545
Jackie's trying to get me
to take some time off,

08:22.589 --> 08:24.329
take a vacation.

08:24.373 --> 08:25.548
God knows when that would be.

08:25.592 --> 08:27.507
Listen to her.

08:30.727 --> 08:32.903
Gibbs, when that
lawyer gets here,

08:32.947 --> 08:34.557
bring him to my office.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.298
I'll help you squeeze him.

08:38.909 --> 08:40.476
The signal that triggered

08:40.520 --> 08:44.045
the pacemaker was piggybacked
onto a TV satellite feed.

08:44.088 --> 08:45.525
Yeah,
this guy is devious.

08:45.568 --> 08:47.309
It's gonna take a while
to back-trace

08:47.352 --> 08:49.529
the source of the hacking,
find out who killed Wiley.

08:49.572 --> 08:50.399
Hey, Abby.

08:50.442 --> 08:52.009
Hey.

08:52.053 --> 08:53.271
Where'd you find 'em?

08:53.315 --> 08:54.882
They were under
my coffee table.

08:54.925 --> 08:57.493
I put them on my desk
in there for you.

09:02.498 --> 09:04.587
What was that about?

09:04.631 --> 09:08.460
Oh, um, Dorney left his gloves
at my house last night.

09:08.504 --> 09:09.418
What was he doing there?

09:10.550 --> 09:11.638
Thanks.

09:11.681 --> 09:12.900
Yep.

09:12.943 --> 09:15.598
Can I ask you guys
a question?

09:15.642 --> 09:16.773
Sure.

09:16.817 --> 09:19.384
How do I get
on Gibbs' good side?

09:19.428 --> 09:21.386
I would kill to be
on his team.

09:21.430 --> 09:24.433
Well, Tim would know.

09:24.476 --> 09:27.305
Gibbs likes agents who
are one step ahead.

09:27.349 --> 09:29.656
You know, anticipate what
he wants before he asks.

09:29.699 --> 09:31.092
Okay.

09:31.135 --> 09:32.484
Thanks, McGee.

09:32.528 --> 09:34.008
Bye, Dorney.

09:34.051 --> 09:35.575
Bye.

09:39.230 --> 09:40.841
What was he doing
at your place?

09:50.502 --> 09:51.591
ZIVA:
This place is a mess.

09:51.634 --> 09:53.636
So was Wiley.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.507
Health problems,

09:55.551 --> 09:58.510
busted for drugs, and was about
to wind up in jail.

09:58.554 --> 10:00.556
Ooh!

10:00.600 --> 10:03.994
Well, this was not bought
on a chief's salary.

10:04.038 --> 10:05.822
Ooh!

10:05.866 --> 10:07.476
[phone ringing]Look at that.

10:07.519 --> 10:08.869
Give me that.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.740
Nice.

10:10.784 --> 10:12.655
Ziva David.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.483
Yes, I'm all set.

10:14.526 --> 10:16.877
Um, I'm looking forward to it.

10:16.920 --> 10:20.663
I have the directions,
and, uh, I'll be there.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.491
Yes.

10:22.534 --> 10:24.188
Yes, thank you.

10:24.232 --> 10:26.538
[sighs]
Why did I say yes?

10:26.582 --> 10:28.540
To what?

10:28.584 --> 10:29.977
The career day
at Montgomery Prep.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.108
I'm still a
little nervous

10:31.152 --> 10:32.414
and unsure of
what to say.

10:33.589 --> 10:37.419
Well, Montgomery Prep
is all boys.

10:37.462 --> 10:38.899
You'll be standing

10:38.942 --> 10:41.336
in front of pubescent males
with raging hormones.

10:41.379 --> 10:42.990
Wear something tight.

10:43.033 --> 10:45.427
They won't hear
a word you say.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.298
Aw, come on.

10:47.342 --> 10:49.170
Looks fantastic.

10:49.213 --> 10:50.606
Look at this thing.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.694
Doesn't this look great?

10:51.738 --> 10:53.653
Take it off.

10:54.741 --> 10:57.004
You're no fun.

10:57.047 --> 10:59.397
I wonder who's
gonna inherit it?

11:01.573 --> 11:02.792
Tony.

11:04.446 --> 11:05.577
Whoa.

11:09.103 --> 11:11.714
VANCE: You are his lawyer--
what was the information

11:11.758 --> 11:13.716
that Chief Wiley
was gonna trade?

11:13.760 --> 11:15.718
I... listen, I-I wish
I could tell you,

11:15.762 --> 11:17.024
but I don't know.

11:17.067 --> 11:19.200
It wasn't like I
didn't try to find out.

11:19.243 --> 11:21.724
But, um, he said
it was classified,

11:21.768 --> 11:23.073
a matter of national security,

11:23.117 --> 11:25.597
and if he told me,
he'd be breaking more laws.

11:26.642 --> 11:28.209
Uh...

11:28.252 --> 11:30.124
he did say
to get your attention

11:30.167 --> 11:32.996
I should drop
the name Agah Bayar.

11:34.606 --> 11:36.608
What was Chief Wiley's
connection to Bayar?

11:36.652 --> 11:37.958
I swear, I don't know,

11:38.001 --> 11:39.307
I only met him yesterday.

11:39.350 --> 11:42.005
He said he saw one of
my commercials on TV.

11:42.049 --> 11:43.528
You've seen them, haven't you?

11:43.572 --> 11:45.139
No.

11:45.182 --> 11:46.880
How'd he pay you?

11:46.923 --> 11:49.534
Uh, that's, um...

11:49.578 --> 11:50.840
confidential.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.929
Let me guess: Cash?

11:52.973 --> 11:54.409
Hundred dollar bills?

11:54.452 --> 11:56.541
VANCE: You sure you don't
have anything else

11:56.585 --> 11:59.109
you can tell us,
Mr. Katzenbach?

11:59.153 --> 12:01.764
This is your last chance.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.984
If we find out you've been
holding something back,

12:04.027 --> 12:06.290
you'll be standing in
front of a Federal judge

12:06.334 --> 12:08.075
as a defendant.

12:08.118 --> 12:10.425
I...

12:15.822 --> 12:17.258
Dorney, what took you so long?

12:17.301 --> 12:18.563
Stopped by the break room.

12:18.607 --> 12:19.695
I understand Agent Gibbs

12:19.739 --> 12:21.566
enjoys a mid-afternoon
cup of coffee.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.133
Uh, yeah, but...McGee!

12:23.177 --> 12:24.613
The probie's showing initiative.

12:24.656 --> 12:26.702
That's good work;
very smart.

12:26.746 --> 12:27.659
Thank you.

12:27.703 --> 12:30.445
Now, come and
get the evidence.

12:30.488 --> 12:31.402
$43,600.

12:31.446 --> 12:32.969
You want to count it?

12:33.013 --> 12:33.927
No, I trust you.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.624
Well, I'm not sure
I trust you,

12:35.667 --> 12:38.366
so please sign the
evidence custody log.

12:39.976 --> 12:42.718
What is this?

12:42.762 --> 12:44.285
I got you a cup of coffee.

12:44.328 --> 12:45.677
I understand you
take it black.

12:45.721 --> 12:46.809
Where'd you get it?

12:46.853 --> 12:48.202
Break room, sir.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.291
That's not coffee.

12:50.334 --> 12:51.466
You done here?

12:52.946 --> 12:55.252
McGEE: Boss,
this is Agah Bayar

12:55.296 --> 12:57.298
passing through
customs at Dulles.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.561
He arrived three days ago
on a flight from Zurich.

12:59.604 --> 13:01.868
I want to know every place
he's been since, McGee.

13:01.911 --> 13:03.260
Working on it.

13:03.304 --> 13:05.001
VANCE:
Gibbs, I just got
off the phone

13:05.045 --> 13:07.395
with Wiley's C.O. at
the Naval Research Lab.

13:07.438 --> 13:09.876
His security team copied
everything on his hard drive.

13:09.919 --> 13:12.356
Two weeks ago, he accessed
schematics and plans

13:12.400 --> 13:14.750
for advanced stealth
communications systems.

13:14.794 --> 13:15.838
That something
he's working on?

13:15.882 --> 13:17.535
No, that's the problem.

13:17.579 --> 13:19.146
His top secret clearance
gives him access

13:19.189 --> 13:20.538
to everything in
the department.

13:20.582 --> 13:21.844
What was taken?

13:21.888 --> 13:23.280
Details on how the drones
and stealth aircraft

13:23.324 --> 13:24.760
communicate with
each other

13:24.804 --> 13:26.153
while still
avoiding detection.

13:26.196 --> 13:27.458
It appears Wiley

13:27.502 --> 13:30.244
transferred everything
onto a flash drive.

13:30.287 --> 13:32.202
I'll fill in and
coordinate with the DIA

13:32.246 --> 13:33.900
and other agencies.McGEE:
In enemy hands,

13:33.943 --> 13:35.858
that information would make
our multibillion dollar

13:35.902 --> 13:38.295
stealth inventory worthless.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.481
ZIVA: This is
our arms dealer, Agah Bayar,

13:50.525 --> 13:51.656
arriving at the Westcott Hotel

13:51.700 --> 13:53.876
45 minutes after
he left Dulles.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.225
TONY: That is some
set of wheels.

13:55.269 --> 13:57.445
1,200 bucks a day,
boss, waiting for him

13:57.488 --> 13:58.489
at the airport.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.578
We tapped into Metro PD

14:00.622 --> 14:02.493
and Homeland Security
surveillance networks,

14:02.537 --> 14:05.366
ran facial recognition--
we had 14 hits on him

14:05.409 --> 14:06.933
in the past three days.

14:06.976 --> 14:08.891
Same camera caught Bayar
leaving the hotel

14:08.935 --> 14:10.153
32 minutes later.

14:10.197 --> 14:11.763
Who's the handbag?

14:11.807 --> 14:14.114
Don't know, but she's
in six of the hits we got.

14:14.157 --> 14:15.506
Georgetown restaurant,
two days ago...

14:15.550 --> 14:16.856
TONY:
Wow.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.466
...and this was
yesterday afternoon.

14:18.509 --> 14:21.251
Wow... I don't like
Bayar's line of work,

14:21.295 --> 14:23.340
but I'll tell you, he's got
great taste in women.

14:23.384 --> 14:24.472
She is smokin'!

14:24.515 --> 14:26.909
Obviously a professional
woman, Tony.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.868
You think the Aston
Martin was expensive?

14:28.911 --> 14:31.000
A month of your
salary might buy you

14:31.044 --> 14:32.480
an hour of her time.

14:32.523 --> 14:34.743
Au contraire, monZiva.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.353
That...

14:36.397 --> 14:37.572
is a girlfriend.

14:37.615 --> 14:39.008
Trust me,
I'm an expert.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.358
Expert in girlfriends
or call girls?GIBBS: Ziva,

14:41.402 --> 14:43.578
find out who she is
and go talk to her.

14:43.621 --> 14:44.796
Mm-hmm.McGee, you
and Abby

14:44.840 --> 14:46.276
have any luck
tracking the signal

14:46.320 --> 14:47.712
that triggered
Wiley's heart attack?

14:47.756 --> 14:49.497
Some. The transmission
was piggybacked

14:49.540 --> 14:52.674
onto a TV satellite,
and before that,

14:52.717 --> 14:54.458
was routed through
a NASA ground antenna

14:54.502 --> 14:55.633
in the Mojave Desert.

14:55.677 --> 14:57.592
That's where Abby and I
hit a roadblock.

14:57.635 --> 14:59.463
But Abby's got a friend
in the space agency;

14:59.507 --> 15:01.683
thinks me may help with
the original source.Where is he now?

15:01.726 --> 15:03.598
TONY: Well, we just
got a hit on him

15:03.641 --> 15:05.426
ten minutes ago--
he is at an embassy...

15:05.469 --> 15:08.429
Republic of Turkey.

15:08.472 --> 15:10.431
McGee, call Fletcher
in Tech Services,

15:10.474 --> 15:12.912
tell him I'm on the way
down to see him.

15:14.696 --> 15:16.524
TONY:
Whoa. Wow.

15:16.567 --> 15:19.048
ZIVA: Do you really think
she's that good-looking?

15:19.092 --> 15:23.009
You're kidding, right?

15:49.035 --> 15:50.558
Agent Gibbs.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.561
What an unexpected surprise.

15:53.604 --> 15:55.998
You enjoying your
stay in Washington?

15:56.042 --> 15:57.565
Yes, I always do.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.784
You have business
at the embassy?

15:59.828 --> 16:01.177
Nope, I'm here
to see you.

16:01.221 --> 16:03.658
And how did you find me?

16:03.701 --> 16:05.007
Cameras.

16:05.051 --> 16:08.184
You know, a lot has
changed since 9/11.

16:08.228 --> 16:11.231
In this city alone,
there's over 5,200
surveillance cameras.

16:11.274 --> 16:12.667
There's one

16:12.710 --> 16:14.016
down at the end
of this block,

16:14.060 --> 16:15.626
in fact, that can
identify a person

16:15.670 --> 16:18.325
within 500 feet.

16:18.368 --> 16:20.675
Sounds like an
invasion of privacy.

16:20.718 --> 16:23.852
Something you Americans
claim to protect against.

16:23.895 --> 16:26.028
We protect ourselves,

16:26.072 --> 16:27.943
from enemies both
foreign and domestic.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.597
I'm a businessman.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.642
I broker deals.

16:31.686 --> 16:32.774
Arms deals.

16:32.817 --> 16:35.342
What do you want, Gibbs?

16:35.385 --> 16:36.996
Just letting you know
that we're watching you,

16:37.039 --> 16:38.562
that we have you
on our radar.

16:38.606 --> 16:41.217
Some of your customers are
on our unfriendly list.

16:41.261 --> 16:43.132
We're getting
a lock on you,

16:43.176 --> 16:45.221
and we're gonna
take you down.

16:46.266 --> 16:47.876
Really?

16:54.535 --> 16:55.666
Are you done?

17:06.112 --> 17:07.765
[starts engine]

17:10.072 --> 17:11.769
[Gibbs dials phone]

17:11.813 --> 17:13.467
McGEE:
Hey, boss.

17:13.510 --> 17:16.078
Hey, the telephonic
warrant come through?

17:16.122 --> 17:16.774
Yes, it did.

17:16.818 --> 17:17.906
Good.

17:17.949 --> 17:19.734
Don't want to break any laws.

17:19.777 --> 17:23.042
I put Fletcher's
tracking device on his car.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.869
Byar just turned right
on Connecticut.

17:24.913 --> 17:26.784
Good. Keep tabs on him.

17:27.829 --> 17:29.831
ZIVA:
Yes, I will hold.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.180
[loud slurping]

17:31.224 --> 17:33.139
All gone.
[chuckles]

17:33.182 --> 17:34.749
Next one's one me;
you earned it.

17:34.792 --> 17:35.880
You know who she is?

17:35.924 --> 17:37.186
Yes.Oh, God,

17:37.230 --> 17:38.666
why didn't you call me?!

17:38.709 --> 17:40.972
I'm the senior agent.I did call you.

17:41.016 --> 17:42.583
I couldn't find
you anywhere.

17:42.626 --> 17:44.672
Hi, Ava Baransky,

17:44.715 --> 17:47.414
with your
British passport. Oh...

17:47.457 --> 17:49.677
I bet she's got one
of those sexy Keira
Knightley accents.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.419
You think she's
a call girl, huh? Hardly.

17:52.462 --> 17:54.029
ZIVA:
She's a successful
fashion model,

17:54.073 --> 17:55.857
as well as an
aspiring actress

17:55.900 --> 17:57.424
rumored to have been seen
with George Clooney,

17:57.467 --> 17:59.034
as well as partied
with Prince Harry.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.731
It just keeps
getting better.

18:00.775 --> 18:02.690
She is...

18:02.733 --> 18:03.908
[British accent]:
rather smashing.

18:03.952 --> 18:05.910
[British accent]:
Yes, I agree. Tell her.

18:05.954 --> 18:08.043
Who are you talking to?Customs at Dulles.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.698
Ava Baranski flew in from London
two hours before Bayar.

18:10.741 --> 18:11.873
Where's she staying?

18:11.916 --> 18:13.483
That's what I'm
trying to figure out.

18:13.527 --> 18:15.398
[phone rings]I'm gonna get that
in my office.

18:15.442 --> 18:17.618
Hopefully it's my friend
Colin, from NASA.

18:18.793 --> 18:20.186
Uh-huh.

18:20.229 --> 18:22.492
Yes. Okay.

18:22.536 --> 18:25.191
Well, thank you very much.

18:25.234 --> 18:26.888
Your girlfriend's
staying at the Westcott.

18:26.931 --> 18:28.150
Same hotel as Bayar.

18:28.194 --> 18:29.499
Let's go.

18:29.543 --> 18:32.154
ZIVA:
Thank you, Abbs.

18:32.198 --> 18:34.461
Promise me you're not
gonna make a fool of
yourself, please.

18:53.262 --> 18:54.742
Uh...

18:59.399 --> 19:00.443
You going up,

19:00.487 --> 19:02.141
Dorneget?Yes, sir.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.539
You going to
the squad room?

19:09.583 --> 19:11.367
No, third floor.

19:16.590 --> 19:17.852
Oh, right.

19:23.292 --> 19:26.382
Buick's out of the
garage, Dorneget.

19:29.298 --> 19:30.734
[whispers]:
Oh, man.

19:35.130 --> 19:36.479
Boss, got something.

19:36.523 --> 19:39.134
This is the surveillance
shot we showed you earlier

19:39.178 --> 19:41.615
of Bayar with the
mystery woman.

19:41.658 --> 19:43.356
Look who comes out
of the same restaurant

19:43.399 --> 19:44.531
30 seconds later.

19:45.706 --> 19:47.708
Our dead chief petty
officer Leland Wiley.

19:47.751 --> 19:49.100
He met with Agah Bayar.

19:49.144 --> 19:50.711
Good for you, McGee.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.408
Nice job.

19:53.453 --> 19:54.845
Hey, you find
the woman?

19:54.889 --> 19:55.890
Ava Baransky bolted.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.283
She was booked
at the Westcott

19:57.326 --> 19:59.241
for the rest of the week,
but checked out early.

19:59.285 --> 20:01.025
TONY: Desk clerk said
she appeared nervous,

20:01.069 --> 20:03.071
stored her luggage
with the concierge
and then she left.

20:03.114 --> 20:05.204
So I thought I'd just
take it downstairs
and go through it?

20:05.247 --> 20:07.249
Ziva, put out a BOLO;
she knows something.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.164
How about I go through
her unmentionables

20:09.208 --> 20:10.861
and you put out the BOLO?

20:14.778 --> 20:16.954
Where is Agah Bayar right now?

20:16.998 --> 20:18.042
Georgetown.

20:18.086 --> 20:19.348
And the car's
not moving.

20:19.392 --> 20:21.263
5600 block
of Dumbarton.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.133
Come on, McGee...

20:22.177 --> 20:24.179
let's go.

20:42.110 --> 20:43.546
There's his car.

20:47.463 --> 20:48.899
Special Agent Gibbs.

20:50.640 --> 20:53.164
Roca, Defense
Intelligence Agency.

20:53.208 --> 20:54.992
Let's get away
from the window.

21:00.868 --> 21:02.783
What's going on?

21:02.826 --> 21:05.742
You weren't thinking
of talking to Agah
Bayar again, were you?

21:05.786 --> 21:07.309
Again?Yeah, we
observed you

21:07.353 --> 21:08.963
outside the Turkish
embassy this morning.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.749
You guys have him
under surveillance?

21:13.924 --> 21:15.012
Why?

21:15.056 --> 21:16.797
Just back off,
stay away from him.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.015
We're investigating a murder.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.626
Our operation trumps that.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.367
Okay, tell us.

21:21.410 --> 21:23.630
You don't have
the need to know.

21:26.023 --> 21:27.373
Excuse me.

21:39.341 --> 21:40.429
Thank you.

21:40.473 --> 21:41.604
Ava Baransky
has been found.

21:41.648 --> 21:42.910
She was trying
to board a plane

21:42.953 --> 21:44.172
at Philadelphia
International Airport.

21:44.215 --> 21:45.956
TSA is holding her.Where was she going?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.828
Toronto, with a
connecting flight to London.

21:47.871 --> 21:49.046
I'll pick her up, boss.

21:49.090 --> 21:50.352
It's only a two-hour drive
to Philly.

21:50.396 --> 21:51.440
And, you know, it's faster
than taking a jet.

21:51.484 --> 21:52.615
Unless we swing
a charter,

21:52.659 --> 21:53.703
because that's
always good.

21:53.747 --> 21:54.878
Whoa, cowboy.

21:54.922 --> 21:55.966
Settle down.

21:56.010 --> 21:57.054
You're not
going anywhere.What?

21:57.098 --> 21:58.142
Ziva, McGee, go.

21:58.186 --> 22:00.101
Uh, Gibbs, Director
Vance wants me

22:00.144 --> 22:01.407
to speak at Montgomery
Prep this afternoon.

22:01.450 --> 22:03.060
I will not
be back in time.

22:08.631 --> 22:10.807
Dorneget.

22:12.853 --> 22:14.376
Come here.

22:16.726 --> 22:18.467
Gear up.
You're going with McGee.

22:18.511 --> 22:20.251
Gear up?

22:21.688 --> 22:23.646
For a field assignment?

22:23.690 --> 22:25.082
I think you're ready.

22:25.126 --> 22:27.041
But I need to be back
in the evidence locker.

22:27.084 --> 22:28.085
I'll handle it.

22:30.610 --> 22:32.046
[grunts]

22:33.090 --> 22:34.135
You all right, Dorneget?

22:34.178 --> 22:36.050
Yes, sir.

22:38.269 --> 22:40.010
I just got off the phone
with SECNAV.

22:40.054 --> 22:42.012
NCIS will not be read
into the DIA op.

22:42.056 --> 22:43.840
Does he know
what's going on?

22:43.884 --> 22:45.364
If he does, he's not telling us.

22:53.023 --> 22:55.417
Now, you know, probie,
this is a test.

22:55.461 --> 22:56.984
That's right.

22:57.027 --> 22:58.768
Gibbs is giving you
little baby steps.

22:58.812 --> 23:00.117
Now, if you
make a mistake,

23:00.161 --> 23:01.945
you don't get a
second chance.

23:01.989 --> 23:04.731
And most importantly,
you follow Gibbs's rules.

23:04.774 --> 23:06.863
Gibbs has rules?

23:06.907 --> 23:08.430
Yep.
How many?

23:08.474 --> 23:10.084
Well, no one's
really sure.

23:10.127 --> 23:11.433
There's a lot of 'em.

23:11.477 --> 23:12.913
What are they?

23:12.956 --> 23:14.958
Well, let's start
with rule number one:

23:15.002 --> 23:16.873
"Never screw over
your partner."

23:16.917 --> 23:19.136
Mm-hmm.

23:19.180 --> 23:21.008
You should be taking notes
on this, by the way.

23:21.051 --> 23:22.096
Oh.

23:22.139 --> 23:23.358
Right. Sorry.

23:34.151 --> 23:35.501
Thanks.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.633
Now, when we get there,
I'm the senior field agent,

23:37.677 --> 23:39.809
so you let me do all
the talking, all right?

23:39.853 --> 23:41.202
You just observe
and back me up.

23:41.245 --> 23:42.638
Yes, sir.

23:44.031 --> 23:45.249
Back you up.

23:45.293 --> 23:46.860
Oh, my God,
I forgot my gun.

23:47.948 --> 23:49.863
Dorneget, you got
to be kidding me.

23:49.906 --> 23:51.299
[sighs]

23:51.342 --> 23:52.779
You know the regulation.

23:52.822 --> 23:55.346
An agent does not leave
the building without his weapon.

23:55.390 --> 23:58.262
If it means anything...

23:58.306 --> 24:00.134
I have my cuffs.

24:05.182 --> 24:06.706
ABBY: Thanks, thanks, thanks,
thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks.

24:06.749 --> 24:08.098
What'd you
want this for?

24:08.142 --> 24:09.970
For Colin.
It's perfect-- he'll love it.

24:10.013 --> 24:11.798
Who's that?
Colin Fisker.

24:11.841 --> 24:13.234
He's my friend
from NASA.

24:13.277 --> 24:15.062
He helped us
track the signal

24:15.105 --> 24:17.107
that sped up
Wiley's pacemaker.

24:17.151 --> 24:19.675
And, um, I kind of

24:19.719 --> 24:21.198
promised him
some other stuff, too.

24:21.242 --> 24:23.113
Like, he
wants to fire

24:23.157 --> 24:24.898
a SIG at the pistol range,

24:24.941 --> 24:27.901
and he wants to take
a ride in the MCRT truck

24:27.944 --> 24:29.946
with all the sirens blaring.

24:29.990 --> 24:31.165
What is he, 12?

24:31.208 --> 24:33.123
Uh, no. He's 16.

24:33.167 --> 24:35.125
He graduated from CalTech
when he was 12.

24:35.169 --> 24:36.649
His mom drops him off

24:36.692 --> 24:38.041
at the space agency
every morning

24:38.085 --> 24:39.782
'cause he doesn't have
a driver's license yet.

24:39.826 --> 24:41.392
Where would you meet
a twerp like that?

24:41.436 --> 24:42.524
At a Mensa retreat

24:42.568 --> 24:44.004
in Santa Fe,
last year.

24:44.047 --> 24:46.572
He was presenting a paper

24:46.615 --> 24:49.270
on magnetic activity
in close binary.

24:49.313 --> 24:50.663
Abby...

24:50.706 --> 24:52.534
what'd Little
Einstein find out?

24:52.578 --> 24:55.885
Okay, so McGee and I
couldn't get past

24:55.929 --> 24:58.671
the NASA antenna
in the Mojave,

24:58.714 --> 25:00.237
so Colin
picked it up from there.

25:00.281 --> 25:02.936
The hacker had sent the signal
all over the world,

25:02.979 --> 25:05.460
but Colin found out that it
actually originated here,

25:05.504 --> 25:07.636
from a smartphone
in Washington, DC.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.551
Whose?Well, since McGee

25:09.595 --> 25:12.119
is babysitting a supermodel,
I guess this is my job.

25:12.162 --> 25:14.034
Excuse me, sir.[taps key]

25:14.077 --> 25:15.514
Phone is registered

25:15.557 --> 25:17.646
to Michael
"Mickey" Reardon.

25:17.690 --> 25:19.561
Conflicted dude--
high school dropout,

25:19.605 --> 25:20.910
then he enlisted
in the Army,

25:20.954 --> 25:22.259
where he got
his technical training.

25:22.303 --> 25:24.044
He was excellent in
the classroom, but had

25:24.087 --> 25:25.132
some behavioral problems.

25:25.175 --> 25:26.525
I can sympathize.

25:26.568 --> 25:27.830
So he was discharged.

25:27.874 --> 25:29.658
Bad conduct. [chuckles]

25:29.702 --> 25:32.226
Then Mr. Smarty-pants
got himself a job

25:32.269 --> 25:33.793
at Broderick Worldwide Security,

25:33.836 --> 25:35.229
the private
military company.

25:35.272 --> 25:37.710
Well, they have a reputation
for not asking questions.

25:37.753 --> 25:39.189
Mm-hmm.

25:39.233 --> 25:40.582
Then Mr. Reardon
blew it again.

25:40.626 --> 25:42.453
He got fired last year;
now he's freelancing

25:42.497 --> 25:44.847
out of his house in Herndon.

25:45.892 --> 25:47.328
Thanks, Abbs.

25:48.895 --> 25:50.723
Hey. What should
I tell Colin?

25:50.766 --> 25:52.855
Tell him to wait
till he grows armpit hair.

25:56.642 --> 25:57.947
Step through, please.

26:01.472 --> 26:03.257
You're here
for Ava Baransky?

26:03.300 --> 26:04.301
Yes.

26:04.345 --> 26:07.783
Special Agent
Timothy McGee, NCIS.

26:07.827 --> 26:09.306
Special Agent Ned Dorneget.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.141
You two are NCIS agents?

26:18.185 --> 26:19.795
Yeah.
Yes, sir.

26:19.839 --> 26:21.188
You kidding me?

26:21.231 --> 26:22.798
I applied to NCIS twice.

26:22.842 --> 26:24.104
Got shot down
both times.

26:24.147 --> 26:25.235
Did you fail
the physical?

26:31.111 --> 26:32.634
McGEE:
Miss Baransky.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.854
We're from NCIS.

26:34.897 --> 26:37.291
Yes. I was told
you were coming.

26:37.334 --> 26:39.206
We're here to accompany
you back to Washington.

26:39.249 --> 26:41.861
This is about
Agah Bayar, isn't it?

26:41.904 --> 26:43.166
Yes.

26:43.210 --> 26:44.211
Can't we just
talk here?

26:44.254 --> 26:46.169
I want to go back home
to London.

26:46.213 --> 26:49.129
When was the last time
you saw Mr. Bayar?

26:50.957 --> 26:53.263
When he woke me up this morning
and informed me

26:53.307 --> 26:55.701
that a business deal
he was working on had gone bad.

26:55.744 --> 26:58.181
He said he didn't want me
to get involved

26:58.225 --> 27:00.009
and suggested I leave
the country at once.

27:00.053 --> 27:02.185
He scared me.

27:02.229 --> 27:03.665
[door opens]

27:04.710 --> 27:06.189
She was traveling light.

27:07.234 --> 27:08.496
I left my luggage
at the Westcott.

27:08.539 --> 27:10.672
I was going to send for it
when I got back home.

27:10.716 --> 27:12.195
We have it at NCIS.

27:13.457 --> 27:14.850
Will you confirm

27:14.894 --> 27:16.112
all your personal
belongings are there?

27:16.156 --> 27:17.244
Yes.

27:19.115 --> 27:20.421
Passport.

27:20.464 --> 27:22.466
Wallet.

27:22.510 --> 27:23.772
Lipstick.

27:23.816 --> 27:25.295
Cell phone.

27:25.339 --> 27:26.514
Yeah, it's all here.

27:26.557 --> 27:27.907
NCIS is taking custody.

27:27.950 --> 27:31.258
One of you kids,
sign here.

27:36.959 --> 27:39.005
Sorry.

27:46.360 --> 27:49.015
ZIVA:
The students were genuinely
interested in the agency

27:49.058 --> 27:50.712
and asked intelligent questions.

27:50.756 --> 27:52.758
Yeah? Like, "How many
bad guys have you shot?"

27:52.801 --> 27:54.281
No. They seem
to be aware

27:54.324 --> 27:55.630
of what's going on
in the world

27:55.674 --> 27:57.240
and want to have careers
that are meaningful.

27:57.284 --> 27:58.677
I totally enjoyed it,

27:58.720 --> 27:59.721
and I volunteered

27:59.765 --> 28:00.896
to return again
next year.

28:00.940 --> 28:02.158
GIBBS:
Looks like he's home.

28:02.202 --> 28:03.333
DiNozzo, take the back.

28:03.377 --> 28:05.074
Got it.

28:08.948 --> 28:10.950
[doorbell rings]

28:14.127 --> 28:15.302
He's running!

28:15.345 --> 28:16.477
[rings doorbell]

28:18.784 --> 28:21.134
Federal agent! Stop!

28:21.177 --> 28:22.483
Oh, this guy's moving!

28:31.405 --> 28:33.712
He's fast!

28:33.755 --> 28:35.322
I know.

28:41.502 --> 28:42.808
Freeze!

28:43.591 --> 28:45.114
Who is this guy?[frustrated grunt]

28:53.949 --> 28:54.733
[tires screeching]

28:55.951 --> 28:59.215
[grunts, gasps]

29:04.830 --> 29:06.832
[both panting]

29:28.810 --> 29:31.378
How did you meet Bayar?

29:32.814 --> 29:34.773
I was on a photo
shoot in Vienna.

29:34.816 --> 29:36.775
We were both staying
at the Imperial.

29:36.818 --> 29:38.689
We went out a few times.

29:38.733 --> 29:40.169
Enjoyed ourselves.

29:40.213 --> 29:42.868
When I got back to London,
Aggie, he sent flowers

29:42.911 --> 29:44.173
and a ticket to Washington.

29:45.218 --> 29:46.915
Do you know what he does
for a living?

29:46.959 --> 29:49.135
We'll get into all that
when we get to NCIS.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.138
Will it take long?

29:52.181 --> 29:53.617
It all depends.

29:53.661 --> 29:55.837
We've got questions
to ask you.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.970
If you cooperate
and tell us what you know,

29:58.013 --> 29:59.406
it shouldn't
take that long.

30:05.194 --> 30:06.979
How long have you been an agent?

30:07.022 --> 30:08.197
Me?

30:08.241 --> 30:10.417
Uh, about six months.

30:10.460 --> 30:12.549
This is my first
field assignment.

30:12.593 --> 30:15.204
Can't say I'm enjoying this.

30:15.248 --> 30:17.250
But I'm glad I'm your first.

30:21.471 --> 30:23.299
Rule number ten:

30:23.343 --> 30:26.346
"Never get involved
personally on a case."

30:28.304 --> 30:29.479
You hit me with
a freaking car!

30:29.523 --> 30:30.524
I should be in
the hospital.

30:30.567 --> 30:31.830
DUCKY:
Yes, he's right.

30:31.873 --> 30:33.875
[groans]
He does have
a broken collarbone.

30:33.919 --> 30:34.963
Duck, I don't have the time.

30:35.007 --> 30:36.095
I got an international
arms dealer

30:36.138 --> 30:37.923
who may be trying to
leave the country.

30:37.966 --> 30:41.100
What meat locker do you
have Chief Wiley in?

30:41.143 --> 30:43.058
206. Why?

30:43.102 --> 30:44.407
Two-zero-sixer.

30:45.452 --> 30:47.584
All right, let's take a...

30:47.628 --> 30:49.586
Oh, yeah, boss,
that's definitely him.

30:49.630 --> 30:50.936
[Reardon yelps]

30:50.979 --> 30:52.111
What the hell
are you doing?

30:52.154 --> 30:54.287
GIBBS: Introducing
you to the man

30:54.330 --> 30:55.549
you killed by remote control.

30:55.592 --> 30:57.856
Look at him, Reardon.
Look at his face.

30:57.899 --> 30:59.118
You did that!

30:59.161 --> 31:02.991
If you cooperate,
if you implicate Agah Bayar,

31:03.035 --> 31:04.906
things are going to go
much easier for you.

31:04.950 --> 31:05.907
A-Agah... Agah who?

31:05.951 --> 31:07.343
I don't even know

31:07.387 --> 31:09.084
what you're
talking about.Hey, Duck?

31:09.128 --> 31:11.173
You should leave now,
because Mr. Reardon here

31:11.217 --> 31:12.522
is not going to survive
his injuries.

31:12.566 --> 31:13.828
Well, if that's
the case,

31:13.872 --> 31:15.786
we're going to need
another slot here.

31:15.830 --> 31:18.354
Ooh, that one's occupied.

31:18.398 --> 31:19.878
Let's see.

31:19.921 --> 31:21.967
That one's free--
and it's refrigerated.

31:22.010 --> 31:24.143
Come on, you're not...
you're not going to let them

31:24.186 --> 31:27.059
get away with
this, are you?I think I'll get a cup of tea.

31:27.102 --> 31:28.364
Anyone else?Yeah, I'd like a cup.

31:28.408 --> 31:29.931
Thanks, Duck.
I'd love one.
Yeah, thanks.

31:29.975 --> 31:31.280
[whimpers]
Let... let go of me!

31:32.803 --> 31:34.327
Tell Agent Gibbs
what he wants to know.

31:34.370 --> 31:36.242
Look, I-I've never heard of
this guy you're talking about.

31:36.285 --> 31:38.418
DiNozzo, get me
something really sharp.

31:38.461 --> 31:40.202
Let's put a little light
on the situation,

31:40.246 --> 31:42.422
see what we got here.[groaning, whimpering]

31:42.465 --> 31:44.119
Oh, look at this.

31:44.163 --> 31:45.991
Ooh, a bone saw!

31:46.034 --> 31:48.254
Okay! Okay, okay, okay.
I-I was hired by a Russian.

31:48.297 --> 31:49.777
Russian?

31:49.820 --> 31:51.083
Yeah. Uh...

31:51.126 --> 31:52.127
an SVR agent.

31:52.171 --> 31:53.476
A great-looking chick.

31:55.478 --> 31:57.959
Baransky's a Russian name.

32:12.278 --> 32:14.149
[groans]

32:20.982 --> 32:23.158
This will be
just a minute.

32:31.210 --> 32:32.820
I need to
use the loo.

32:32.863 --> 32:34.169
Can I take my purse?

32:34.213 --> 32:35.823
Sure.

32:39.870 --> 32:41.829
I don't go in
with her, right?

32:41.872 --> 32:43.613
Check out the bathroom,
make sure there's no window

32:43.657 --> 32:45.441
or other exit,
stand outside the door?

32:45.485 --> 32:46.877
Yes.

32:46.921 --> 32:47.966
Standard procedure.

32:51.578 --> 32:53.188
There you go.

32:55.103 --> 32:56.887
CHALLIS:
Well, yes, of course we're aware

32:56.931 --> 32:58.019
of Ava Baransky.

32:58.063 --> 32:59.412
We've been monitoring her
for years.

32:59.455 --> 33:02.676
Director Vance,
this is Inspector Challis, MI5.

33:02.719 --> 33:03.720
Inspector.

33:03.764 --> 33:05.374
Director.Please continue.

33:05.418 --> 33:06.897
What can you tell us
about her?

33:06.941 --> 33:08.377
She was born in England.

33:08.421 --> 33:10.640
British mother, Russian father.

33:10.684 --> 33:12.207
Her parents separated,

33:12.251 --> 33:14.383
and her father was transferred
back to Moscow.

33:14.427 --> 33:18.518
Baransky spent only one year at
the London School of Economics

33:18.561 --> 33:21.042
before dropping out and going
to visit her father in Moscow.

33:21.086 --> 33:22.435
That's when we think
she was turned

33:22.478 --> 33:24.045
and we put her on a watch list.

33:24.089 --> 33:26.265
So you suspect that
she's a Russian agent?

33:26.308 --> 33:27.527
Oh, most definitely.

33:27.570 --> 33:30.704
Her father was a general
in the old KGB.

33:30.747 --> 33:34.055
Now he's high up in the new SVR
counterintelligence section.

33:34.099 --> 33:35.796
Why wasn't her
passport flagged?

33:35.839 --> 33:38.929
Why weren't we told?

33:38.973 --> 33:41.236
Don't you Americans
talk to each other?

33:41.280 --> 33:43.195
Your DIA instructed us

33:43.238 --> 33:45.980
to make sure she got through
customs without a hitch.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.026
We removed all notations
from her file.

33:48.069 --> 33:50.071
Wasn't NCIS read in?

33:50.115 --> 33:52.639
Thank you for the briefing,
Inspector Challis.

33:54.684 --> 33:58.906
Oh, don't be taken in
by the young girl's good looks.

33:58.949 --> 34:02.040
She's a skilled martial artist
and weapons expert.

34:05.652 --> 34:07.784
All right,
what the hell's going on?

34:07.828 --> 34:10.483
Agah Bayar was
the middleman.

34:10.526 --> 34:12.093
Ava Baransky
was the client.

34:12.137 --> 34:15.183
She was buying the stealth
technology for the Russians.

34:15.227 --> 34:17.794
Then why let her
into the country?

34:17.838 --> 34:20.841
I'm gonna go straight to
the DIA director to find out.

34:20.884 --> 34:23.017
I'll let McGee know.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.411
Hey, boss.

34:25.454 --> 34:27.891
Yeah, we just stopped for gas.

34:27.935 --> 34:29.415
Ava Baransky is no
longer a witness,

34:29.458 --> 34:31.112
she's a suspect;
consider her dangerous.

34:31.156 --> 34:32.592
What's going on?

34:32.635 --> 34:33.680
McGee,

34:33.723 --> 34:35.551
I'll fill you in
when you get back.

34:42.036 --> 34:45.083
Dorneget!

34:45.126 --> 34:47.128
DORNEGET:
McGee!

34:47.172 --> 34:48.173
I'm in the bathroom!

34:48.999 --> 34:50.262
I'm in here!

34:50.305 --> 34:51.959
McGee!

34:54.004 --> 34:55.136
I don't know
what happened!

34:55.180 --> 34:56.877
I came here to look around,

34:56.920 --> 34:58.270
and the next thing I know,
I was on the ground

34:58.313 --> 35:00.228
and she was choking me,
and then I woke up

35:00.272 --> 35:02.535
and my tie was in my
mouth, and she was gone.

35:02.578 --> 35:04.102
[grunts]

35:07.192 --> 35:09.194
We gotta find her.

35:09.237 --> 35:11.457
You know, if you hadn't
been so distracted

35:11.500 --> 35:13.154
by her beauty,
none of this would've happened.

35:13.198 --> 35:14.460
I wasn't even
attracted to her!

35:14.503 --> 35:16.505
Oh, please. You couldn't
take your eyes off of her.

35:16.549 --> 35:18.551
She really didn't do it for me.
She's not my type.

35:18.594 --> 35:20.466
She's every guy's type,
Dorneget.

35:20.509 --> 35:22.294
McGee, I'm not
attracted to any woman!

35:22.337 --> 35:24.470
I'm gay.

35:28.213 --> 35:30.954
My first assignment as an
agent, and I lose the suspect.

35:30.998 --> 35:32.217
Gibbs is going
to kill me!

35:32.260 --> 35:33.957
We're both dead meat.

35:34.001 --> 35:34.958
[cell phone ringing]

35:35.002 --> 35:36.830
[groans]

35:36.873 --> 35:38.310
It's Gibbs.

35:38.353 --> 35:40.660
What are you
gonna tell him?

35:40.703 --> 35:42.140
The truth.

35:42.183 --> 35:44.229
That's my rule number one:
never lie to Gibbs.

35:44.272 --> 35:45.969
Boss?

35:46.013 --> 35:48.363
Are you sure?

35:48.407 --> 35:50.060
Mm-hmm.

35:50.104 --> 35:51.061
Boss?

35:51.105 --> 35:52.150
I see.

35:52.193 --> 35:53.673
Boss, are you there?

35:53.716 --> 35:54.674
McGee,

35:54.717 --> 35:55.675
let her go.

35:55.718 --> 35:57.155
Excuse me?

35:57.198 --> 35:58.460
Ava Baransky.

35:58.504 --> 36:01.289
Tell her we no longer
need to interview her.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.943
Apologize for the
inconvenience,

36:02.986 --> 36:05.989
and tell her that you'll take
her anywhere she wants to go.

36:06.033 --> 36:07.774
What happened?

36:07.817 --> 36:10.080
Trying to
find that out.

36:10.124 --> 36:12.257
Thank you.

36:14.302 --> 36:15.564
We're toast, right?

36:18.132 --> 36:19.351
What was his
explanation?

36:21.396 --> 36:23.355
Will you excuse us, please?

36:29.012 --> 36:32.407
The stealth technology
stolen by Chief Wiley,

36:32.451 --> 36:35.149
brokered by Agah Bayar
and sold to Ava Baransky

36:35.193 --> 36:37.499
was all part of a DIA sting.

36:37.543 --> 36:39.153
It was misinformation.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.286
It was a fake? Phony?

36:41.329 --> 36:45.290
Intended to sabotage Russian
stealth communications research.

36:45.333 --> 36:48.162
Well, that's why they
want to let her go.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.555
Yep.

36:49.598 --> 36:52.253
She has it on a flash drive
disguised as a lipstick.

36:52.297 --> 36:55.256
DIA must have known
that Wiley needed money

36:55.300 --> 36:58.259
to support his habit,
so they dangled the bait,

36:58.303 --> 36:59.695
and he took it.

36:59.739 --> 37:01.131
Yeah, and they couldn't
have guessed he'd get busted

37:01.175 --> 37:02.785
for drugs and want to
make a deal with us.

37:02.829 --> 37:05.527
And when the Russians found out,
they hired Reardon to kill him.

37:07.181 --> 37:08.574
Leon, what do I
tell my team?

37:08.617 --> 37:09.749
Tell them nothing.

37:09.792 --> 37:11.794
It's still
need-to-know.

37:15.407 --> 37:19.149
How in the world do Wiley
and Agah Bayar know each other?

37:25.025 --> 37:26.374
What just happened?

37:26.418 --> 37:28.289
I don't know.

37:28.333 --> 37:29.334
[sighs]

37:29.377 --> 37:30.813
We're the luckiest
guys alive.

37:30.857 --> 37:33.425
Don't count your chickens.

37:33.468 --> 37:35.035
What do you mean?
Gibbs.

37:35.078 --> 37:37.037
Somehow, he finds things out.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.386
Not if we don't
tell anyone.

37:38.430 --> 37:40.170
You're not going to
tell anyone, are you?

37:40.214 --> 37:41.433
No.

37:41.476 --> 37:43.086
But I'm not gonna lie if asked.

37:43.130 --> 37:44.653
[sighs]

37:46.786 --> 37:48.744
About the other
thing I mentioned...

37:48.788 --> 37:50.616
What, that you're gay?

37:50.659 --> 37:51.834
That's cool.

37:51.878 --> 37:53.836
I don't advertise it.

37:53.880 --> 37:56.317
Not a lot of people
at the agency know.

37:56.361 --> 37:57.449
I understand.

37:57.492 --> 38:01.366
How do you think
DiNozzo will react?

38:01.409 --> 38:03.150
Oh, he'll be happy.

38:03.193 --> 38:05.848
Really?

38:05.892 --> 38:06.893
Yeah.

38:06.936 --> 38:09.896
Less competition.

38:09.939 --> 38:11.114
Hmm.

38:11.158 --> 38:14.422
[typing]

38:16.468 --> 38:18.383
Tony, sit down, relax.

38:18.426 --> 38:19.732
Why'd they let her go?

38:19.775 --> 38:21.211
McGee did not say.

38:21.255 --> 38:22.517
I do not think
he knows.

38:22.561 --> 38:23.431
Why are you so upset?

38:23.475 --> 38:24.780
Really wanted to meet her.

38:24.824 --> 38:27.305
Well, she's completely
out of your ballpark.

38:27.348 --> 38:28.349
League.

38:28.393 --> 38:30.090
She's a successful
British model,

38:30.133 --> 38:31.787
dates princes, movie
stars, millionaires.

38:31.831 --> 38:33.398
What could you
possibly offer her?

38:33.441 --> 38:36.314
Ah, the DiNozzo charm.

38:36.357 --> 38:39.447
That charm ended
with the last generation.

38:39.491 --> 38:41.275
Ooh!

38:41.319 --> 38:42.276
Dorneget!

38:42.320 --> 38:43.408
Hey, hey, hey, man.

38:43.451 --> 38:44.583
Just the guy I wanted to see.

38:44.626 --> 38:45.627
So how was she?

38:45.671 --> 38:46.976
Was she really hot?

38:47.020 --> 38:48.543
I'd ask Probie-One,
but you can't trust him.

38:48.587 --> 38:50.240
He's got strange taste in women.

38:50.284 --> 38:52.155
Come on.

38:52.199 --> 38:53.548
She was beautiful.

38:53.592 --> 38:54.593
[gasps]

38:54.636 --> 38:55.681
Stunning, in fact.

38:55.724 --> 38:57.683
Sexier in person.

38:57.726 --> 38:59.685
And with a
British accent.

38:59.728 --> 39:01.382
[Tony sighs]

39:01.426 --> 39:03.210
British accent-- I knew it.

39:06.169 --> 39:07.780
Where's Gibbs?

39:12.698 --> 39:14.656
Thank you.

39:24.623 --> 39:29.454
I did not think I'd see
you so soon, Agent Gibbs.

39:29.497 --> 39:31.586
Care for a
glass of wine?

39:31.630 --> 39:33.632
I'm working.

39:36.112 --> 39:38.898
I take it you still have
your radars locked on me.

39:40.943 --> 39:43.816
How'd you know that Chief Petty
Officer Wiley was approachable

39:43.859 --> 39:45.295
and would sell information?

39:48.473 --> 39:51.258
Who are you working for?

39:51.301 --> 39:54.261
Well, in my profession,
I walk a very fine line.

39:54.304 --> 39:57.090
But I usually work for
whomever pays me the most.

39:57.133 --> 39:58.265
In this case?

39:58.308 --> 40:01.529
Sometimes you
get lucky.

40:01.573 --> 40:03.488
I got paid from
both sides.

40:06.534 --> 40:08.884
The Russians wanted
the information,

40:08.928 --> 40:11.670
and U.S. intelligence wanted
them to have a version of it,

40:11.713 --> 40:13.802
and you were
the perfect middleman

40:13.846 --> 40:15.369
to make it all seem legit.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.937
Correct.

40:17.980 --> 40:19.808
So we're playing
for the same team.

40:21.680 --> 40:22.811
This time.

40:22.855 --> 40:25.640
Come on, Gibbsey.

40:25.684 --> 40:28.643
