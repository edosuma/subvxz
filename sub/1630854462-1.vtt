NARRATOR: Once upon a time
in a faraway land known as the 1980s,

00:26.625 --> 00:31.333
there was a lovely, smart, funny American
girl named Donna who moved to England,

00:31.416 --> 00:34.958
where she fell in love with
a handsome Frenchman named Henrique.

00:35.041 --> 00:37.750
They had a perfect child
whom they called Eloise,

00:37.833 --> 00:42.416
and all was well until one day
Henrique decided, as we say in England,

00:42.500 --> 00:44.500
to fuck the babysitter.

00:44.583 --> 00:48.750
And so dear Donna returned to
her charming hometown of Indianapolis,

00:48.833 --> 00:52.625
where she met another man who was--
well, he was Bill.

00:52.708 --> 00:55.958
And Donna had two more children,
Alice and Paul.

00:56.041 --> 00:58.333
For half the year,
Eloise would come to stay with them

00:58.416 --> 01:01.291
and enjoy all the delights
of Midwestern life:

01:01.375 --> 01:05.916
the motor speedway, the Putt-Putt,
and of course the mall.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.166

ELF PHOTO CLERK:
Okay, everyone, say "jingle."

01:14.500 --> 01:16.625
-ALL: Jingle!
-(camera clicks)

01:16.708 --> 01:18.500
Okay, everybody, hats and sweaters off.

01:18.583 --> 01:20.041
Let's see that Easter flair.

01:20.125 --> 01:22.583
All right, you heard your mother.
He is risen. Let's go!

01:22.666 --> 01:23.750
Uh, wh-what's happening?

01:23.833 --> 01:26.083
Well, I paid for three pictures,
so we're moving on to Easter.

01:26.166 --> 01:28.625
Hey, big guy, do you mind stepping aside
for these next ones?

01:28.708 --> 01:30.125
Yeah, let's go. Go get yourself a potato.

01:30.208 --> 01:31.458
Extra bacon bits. You earned it. Let's go.

01:31.541 --> 01:32.875
He's not allowed to eat in his suit.

01:32.958 --> 01:34.958
DONNA:
Oh, just roll with it. Come here, Paulie.

01:35.041 --> 01:37.458
-Ooh, Mom, can we be hugging
in the picture? -Yes.

01:37.541 --> 01:38.666
Oh, let's flex.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.333
-Uh, yes to hugging, no to flexing.
-Yes. -Yay!

01:40.416 --> 01:42.416
-(camera clicks) -Excuse me.
We weren't ready. -Come on.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.875
I-I'm sorry.
There's a lot of people waiting.

01:44.958 --> 01:47.291
All right, I will pay
for the four-picture package.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.166
I can pay for it, Mum.

01:49.250 --> 01:52.166
El, no, I'm not gonna allow
my 13-year-old daughter to pay for this.

01:52.250 --> 01:54.666
-Her dad sent her here with $3,000.
-I know.

01:54.750 --> 01:56.500
Oh, yeah, but we already decided
she's buying us a Jet Ski.

01:56.583 --> 01:57.583
-Bill.
-(Alice laughs)

01:57.666 --> 01:59.208
-I thought we landed on a hot tub.
-(Bill laughs)

01:59.291 --> 02:02.208
How about one of those limousines
with a hot tub?

02:02.291 --> 02:03.375
Let's get a lion.

02:03.458 --> 02:06.208
-Let's get a Taco Bell
and put it in our backyard. -Yes!

02:06.291 --> 02:07.333
Everybody, say...

02:07.416 --> 02:08.416
Bunny.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.916
-ALL: Bunny!
-(camera clicks)

02:10.000 --> 02:11.541
Great. Okay, red, white and blue.

02:11.625 --> 02:13.041
-Quick like bunnies.
-BILL: Wait.

02:13.125 --> 02:14.541
You're forgetting
a very important holiday.

02:14.625 --> 02:16.125
Give that to your mother.

02:16.208 --> 02:17.250
And we'll all say...

02:17.333 --> 02:19.375
BILL and KIDS:
Surprise!

02:19.458 --> 02:21.208
ELOISE:
Happy Mother's Day, Mum.

02:21.291 --> 02:24.333
Sorry I always have to miss it.

02:24.416 --> 02:26.416
This is so nice.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.166
BILL:
Aw. Oh, don't cry.

02:28.250 --> 02:29.375
This is supposed to make you happy.

02:29.458 --> 02:32.041
I'm sorry. I can't stop it.
It's happening.

02:32.125 --> 02:35.166
Mom, does Ellie really
have to go home tomorrow?

02:35.250 --> 02:36.458
Well, honey, she will be back
before you even know it.

02:36.541 --> 02:38.458
Why can't her dad live here?

02:38.541 --> 02:40.333
Because he lives in England, Alice.

02:40.416 --> 02:41.833
-I hate England!
-Oh.

02:41.916 --> 02:42.958
That's reasonable.

02:43.041 --> 02:44.958
I'm sorry. Should I take the picture?

02:45.041 --> 02:48.166
This isn't gonna get any better, hon.
Just take it.

02:48.250 --> 02:50.208
-(sighs)
-(camera clicks)

02:50.291 --> 02:53.083
NARRATOR: Yes, Donna's three children
were once thick as thieves.

02:53.166 --> 02:56.166
But as they grew, well, they grew apart.

02:56.250 --> 02:58.458
Eloise had her father's fortune,

02:58.541 --> 03:03.416
and Alice and Paul had
their father's Chrysler Sebring.

03:03.500 --> 03:08.000
By the year 2022, the family had
scattered to the four winds,

03:08.083 --> 03:12.833
but there was a glimmer of hope that could
perhaps bring them all together once more.

03:12.916 --> 03:15.458
I'm speaking of course of a wedding.

Oh, my fucking God,
have you seen this invitation?

04:47.500 --> 04:50.125
I-I am five minutes away from
homiciding someone.

04:50.208 --> 04:51.958
-I can't stand her.
-I know. I know.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.833
I opened mine this morning, and then
I just put it down on my kitchen table,

04:54.916 --> 04:57.625
I poured kerosene everywhere, and then
I just literally burned my own house down.

04:57.708 --> 04:59.291
I mean, the invites are gorgeous,

04:59.375 --> 05:03.375
but I'm not kidding,
I think she spent like $25,000.

05:03.458 --> 05:05.458
And they smell like rosemary.

05:05.541 --> 05:07.583
I am moving to space.

05:07.666 --> 05:09.041
Okay, I'm screaming, and I'm dead.

05:09.125 --> 05:11.833
I died of screaming, and now I'm also--
I'm stabbing people.

05:11.916 --> 05:13.458
I'm just, I'm just randomly
stabbing people.

05:13.541 --> 05:15.291
-Paul!
-Oh, sorry.

05:15.375 --> 05:16.375
Okay, give me one second.

05:16.458 --> 05:18.333
I'm at work,
and I have a patient in a trash can.

05:18.416 --> 05:20.541
That sounds fine and normal.

05:20.625 --> 05:22.000
Okay, you got nine more minutes, Helen.

05:22.083 --> 05:23.291
-That's it.
-(patients babbling, woman shrieks)

05:23.375 --> 05:25.458
There is a maxi pad near my shin.

05:25.541 --> 05:27.875
-How does that make you feel, honey?
-I want to get out.

05:27.958 --> 05:30.333
I want you to let that feeling in
but just not act on it.

05:30.416 --> 05:32.958
I am gonna add some more trash now.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.708
Now, remember, this might feel like
I'm heaping garbage on you...

05:35.791 --> 05:38.208
-(gasps)
-...but it's a gift.

05:38.291 --> 05:39.208
Hi. Sorry.

05:39.291 --> 05:40.916
Are you going to the wedding?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.500
No, I'm not going.

05:42.583 --> 05:45.583
Alice, Eloise is our half sister, which
means we can half-ass the relationship.

05:45.666 --> 05:47.375
Although, she did ask me
to be her maid of honor

05:47.458 --> 05:49.291
when I was like 17.

05:49.375 --> 05:51.875
Oh, my God. You're gonna go, aren't you?

05:51.958 --> 05:53.041
She doesn't even want us there.

05:53.125 --> 05:55.708
Or maybe she wants us to be her butlers.
Whatever.

05:55.791 --> 05:57.166
-I'm not going.
-Uh-huh.

05:57.250 --> 05:58.958
-(retches)
-Okay, I really need to go now.

05:59.041 --> 06:03.583
Listen, Alice, stay strong,
and please tell Mom to stop calling me.

06:03.666 --> 06:04.916

06:05.000 --> 06:06.500
DONNA:

DONNA:
Oh, God, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

06:20.833 --> 06:22.708
No worries. Uh, it's just my face.

06:22.791 --> 06:23.958
Uh, okay, let's see.

06:24.041 --> 06:26.041
-Let me just...
-DONNA: I just got-- I couldn't get...

06:27.291 --> 06:28.500
Can you unzip?

06:28.583 --> 06:30.208
-Whew.
-Sure.

06:30.291 --> 06:31.541
-(fabric ripping)
-DONNA: I got it. Wait.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.166
Oh, okay.

06:33.250 --> 06:34.916
-Oh, I'm so sorry.
-Oh.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.208
(fabric rips)

06:38.583 --> 06:39.833
Hi. (chuckles)

06:39.916 --> 06:41.791
-I will pay for this.
-Don't worry about it.

06:41.875 --> 06:44.500
Are you shopping for a special occasion?

06:44.583 --> 06:47.208
Yes, my daughter Eloise
is getting married in England.

06:47.291 --> 06:48.333
She lives there.

06:48.416 --> 06:51.166
My first husband was European.
French. Henrique.

06:51.250 --> 06:52.375
He's a douchebag.

06:52.458 --> 06:54.916
-Oh. Okay. -And my other children
from my second marriage--

06:55.000 --> 06:56.291
they don't seem
to really like me right now.

06:56.375 --> 06:57.458
Especially my son Paul.

06:57.541 --> 07:00.541
Ever since his father Bill died--
Bill was my second husband.

07:00.625 --> 07:02.458
-Yeah.
-(sighs) Life's a journey.

07:02.541 --> 07:07.458
As for me, well, I guess the, uh...
(panting)

07:07.541 --> 07:09.958
romantic chapters of my life are over,

07:10.041 --> 07:13.000
and I'm-I'm not sure what to do next.

07:13.083 --> 07:15.333
-Well...
-And I've also developed

07:15.416 --> 07:16.541
this totally irrational fear of traveling.

07:16.625 --> 07:17.958
I'm so anxious.

07:18.041 --> 07:19.750
But my friend Barbara gave me
some pot for my flight.

07:19.833 --> 07:21.833
-Do you do pot?
-Uh, I...

07:21.916 --> 07:23.625
Oh, you can't answer that.
You're at work, so don't.

07:23.708 --> 07:27.166
The point is I haven't had
all my children together for a while.

07:27.250 --> 07:29.875
I mean, since Bill's funeral.

07:32.041 --> 07:34.708
Shall I get you some other options?

07:34.791 --> 07:37.875
Yes. Yes.
I'll try not to completely destroy them.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.500

08:01.833 --> 08:04.958
I absolutely can

08:05.041 --> 08:07.333
I'm very cold

It's very hard to be a parent, Paul.

Okay, Helen, it's time for you
to get back in the trash,

to take those puppies off.

You're gonna have to rip these shoes

Uh, it's just right here.

09:03.208 --> 09:06.583
Uh, reschedule my Friday lunch, and
do you want to sit in on my two o'clock?

09:06.666 --> 09:08.541
I could really use your input on this one.

09:08.625 --> 09:10.625
Yeah. I could squeeze you in.

Only if it's someplace nice.
No cheeseburgers.

-What if it's a very, very cool
food truck? -No.

09:20.083 --> 09:21.166
You own this whole company.

09:21.250 --> 09:23.500
You are not buying me a cheeseburger, bro.

09:23.583 --> 09:26.500
Did you just call me "bro"
while we're fucking?

09:26.583 --> 09:28.500
I'm sorry. Your Honor.

09:28.583 --> 09:29.583
That's better. Say that one more time.

-Your Honor.
-Oh. Oh, shit. Oh.

09:34.791 --> 09:39.083
How much money worth of wine
do you think is in this cup?

09:39.166 --> 09:41.666
Like, is this $45 worth?

09:41.750 --> 09:44.625
You know, sometimes I think that you're
actually just using me for my fortune.

09:44.708 --> 09:46.541
Oh, my God, no.

09:46.625 --> 09:47.916
I'm using you for your dick.

and I thought she was amazing,
but she was just rich.

10:09.166 --> 10:10.416
Oh, that sucks.

10:10.500 --> 10:15.041
No, not like a cool rich person
like you or like Iron Man.

10:15.125 --> 10:17.791
-We're basically the same person.
-Mm-hmm. But it's different.

10:17.875 --> 10:21.000
She's not there for me, you know?
Like, literally.

10:21.083 --> 10:23.416
She was supposed to come see me
last summer.

10:23.500 --> 10:26.500
Oh, so she wasn't there
for the breakup or the miscarriage?

10:26.583 --> 10:27.625
Yeah, whatever.

10:27.708 --> 10:31.458
She bailed, chose to stay in London
and play cricket

10:31.541 --> 10:33.208
and shove fish and chips up her butt.

10:33.291 --> 10:34.833
That's not how you eat them.

10:34.916 --> 10:36.208
You should go.

10:36.291 --> 10:38.208
Or maybe...

10:38.291 --> 10:39.541
we should go?

10:39.625 --> 10:41.208
What?

10:41.291 --> 10:42.333
-(fire roars)
-(gasps)

10:42.416 --> 10:44.458
Give a girl a little warning.

10:44.541 --> 10:46.083
Give her some warning next time.

10:46.166 --> 10:47.500
(laughs)

10:47.583 --> 10:49.625
-Date night.
-(lively chatter)

10:49.708 --> 10:51.041
She's kind of up there, you know.

10:51.125 --> 10:52.375
Hey, boys.

10:52.458 --> 10:55.333
-(laughter)
-So excited for your big show tonight.

10:55.416 --> 10:58.333
Do you know Paul has never seen King Lear?

10:58.416 --> 11:00.541
Well, to be fair,
I did see Gnomeo & Juliet,

11:00.625 --> 11:02.833
by myself, through a series of mix-ups.

11:02.916 --> 11:06.000
Oh, we're doing a whole gender thing,
so it's actually Queen Lear.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.208
Oh, wow.

11:07.291 --> 11:10.000
I'm sure it's better than that production
of Cats where they made them all dogs.

11:10.083 --> 11:11.083
(laughter)

11:11.166 --> 11:12.333
Oh, hey, Dallas.

11:12.416 --> 11:13.833
Hi.

11:13.916 --> 11:16.541
Dallas, you have to meet Dominic and Paul.

11:16.625 --> 11:19.791
They are our best friends, and it is
a travesty we haven't introduced you yet.

11:19.875 --> 11:21.916
DOMINIC:
Hi, Dallas. Is it true what they say?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.708
Is everything bigger in Texas?

11:23.791 --> 11:26.208
(laughs) Well, hi, boys. Uh...

11:26.291 --> 11:27.750
Oh, there's the lights.

11:27.833 --> 11:29.750
Let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

11:29.833 --> 11:31.708
Um, I'm not a part of that.

11:31.791 --> 11:33.541
I'm just their straight friend.

11:33.625 --> 11:34.625
Yeah, we figured.

11:34.708 --> 11:36.208
You dress straight.

11:36.291 --> 11:38.041
PAUL:
Wait, Dom.

11:38.125 --> 11:40.250
What is a Dallas?

11:40.333 --> 11:42.583
He's their, you know, extra.

11:42.666 --> 11:44.000
-They opened their relationship?
-Mm-hmm.

11:44.083 --> 11:45.083
I'm shocked.

11:45.166 --> 11:47.708
-Oh, Paul, you're so easily shocked.
-I am not.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.750
Yes. You're shocked every time
they reveal a Masked Singer.

11:49.833 --> 11:51.291
Okay, well, it's never
who you expect it to be.

11:51.375 --> 11:53.375
That's the whole point of the show.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.416
(sighs)

11:58.500 --> 12:02.250
Paul, I'd love to talk to you

12:02.333 --> 12:05.375
about making the trip.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.083
Airplane emoji.

12:07.166 --> 12:09.666
Where are you? Where are you? Oh.

12:09.750 --> 12:10.958
-No, that's a knife.
-(phone whooshes)

12:11.041 --> 12:12.375
(gasps)

12:12.458 --> 12:14.875
...that she may feel.

12:14.958 --> 12:18.666
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.625
-To have a thankless child.
-(phone buzzing)

12:20.708 --> 12:23.583
(quietly):
Why did she send a knife?

12:28.791 --> 12:30.416
All right, sir, this is your destination.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.500
Please feel free to give me a five-star
rating on my pretend Uber account.

12:33.583 --> 12:35.208
I will give you six.

12:35.291 --> 12:36.833
-...ty-nine?
-No.

12:36.916 --> 12:39.333
-Yes! You said it.
-(chuckles)

12:39.416 --> 12:41.625
All right, time to face the music.

12:41.708 --> 12:44.541
You know, you could come to my place
sometime, for the night.

12:44.625 --> 12:48.083
You could even ride up front
like a real boy.

12:48.166 --> 12:51.458
No, the-the way that she's gonna yell
at me for being this late is bad enough.

12:51.541 --> 12:53.666
I mean, if-if I was out all night,
believe me...

12:53.750 --> 12:55.666
Yeah, okay. I get it. Never mind.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.666
Alice, I'm sorry.

12:57.750 --> 13:00.166
I mean, she already knows
that I want a separation, but...

13:00.250 --> 13:02.000
(house door opens)

13:04.750 --> 13:06.583
The baby.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.125
Yeah.

13:08.208 --> 13:09.458
(exhales)

13:09.541 --> 13:11.541
Okay, I hate you. Go.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.166
(sighs) I hate you, too.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.875
See you tomorrow.

13:17.083 --> 13:18.958
(car door closes)

13:22.791 --> 13:24.458
(house door closes)

13:25.500 --> 13:27.208
(sighs)

13:27.291 --> 13:29.416
I'm worried about Preston and Crosby.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.625
An open relationship
just sounds very messy.

13:31.708 --> 13:33.833
Mm, I think that's sort of the point.
(chuckles)

13:33.916 --> 13:35.375
I thought they were happy.

13:35.458 --> 13:37.708
Maybe they just want to share
their happiness with someone else.

13:37.791 --> 13:41.833
Gosh, Paul, you're so young
but so traditional.

13:41.916 --> 13:43.500
Well, I think it's nice when two people

13:43.583 --> 13:46.875
can really commit to each other
for life, you know?

13:46.958 --> 13:49.000
Like I thought my parents did.

13:49.083 --> 13:51.166
-Maybe they did.
-No. No.

13:51.250 --> 13:54.041
My mom threw away all my dad's stuff,
like, a week after he died,

13:54.125 --> 13:56.041
like he never even existed.

13:56.125 --> 13:57.333
And she never even talks about him.

13:57.416 --> 13:59.916
I still don't think
this awkwardness with your mom

14:00.000 --> 14:01.666
should stop us from going to London.

14:01.750 --> 14:02.750
-(sighs)
-Hmm?

14:02.833 --> 14:05.833
Okay, well, honey, my mom's not
the only reason I don't want to go, okay?

14:05.916 --> 14:08.583
I also... have to work.

14:08.666 --> 14:11.875
And... um, well, I don't like scones.

14:11.958 --> 14:16.250
Okay, so scones and open relationships--
they're off the table.

14:17.333 --> 14:19.666
Wait, do you really wish
we had an open relationship?

14:19.750 --> 14:20.916
No.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.125
(chuckles):
No, I don't.

14:23.208 --> 14:26.083
(sighs) Paul, I think
you should talk to your mom.

14:26.166 --> 14:30.958
You know, maybe she had her reasons
for being weird with your dad, you know?

14:31.041 --> 14:32.791
Maybe he was whoring around town.

14:32.875 --> 14:35.750
You know, really giving it to the ladies
at the Fuddruckers.

14:35.833 --> 14:39.208
No, no. That's my mom's first husband
that cheated on her.

14:39.291 --> 14:41.500
But she still has his picture
up in her house.

14:41.583 --> 14:42.625
Henrique.

14:42.708 --> 14:45.500
So then there's no Frenchmen
in our threesomes?

14:45.583 --> 14:47.875
(sighs) You're hilarious.

15:55.958 --> 15:58.250
Um, you're here to water the plants.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.291
-Yep.
-Great.

16:00.375 --> 16:03.458
I, um, came in to, uh, return the stapler,

16:03.541 --> 16:05.583
and then...

16:05.666 --> 16:07.583
something went wrong with my underwear.

16:07.666 --> 16:09.875
As you can see. They slipped down.

16:09.958 --> 16:12.166
They fell right off.

16:12.250 --> 16:14.166
-I know that sounds crazy, but...
-Nope.

16:14.250 --> 16:15.583
It's happened to me a bunch of times.

16:15.666 --> 16:16.750
Let's troubleshoot.

16:16.833 --> 16:18.583
Let me help you out here.

16:18.666 --> 16:19.833
-I got this.
-I can probably just...

16:19.916 --> 16:21.916
No, no. I got this.
Sorry. I got this. Please.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.375
-All right, I see exactly what happened.
-You do?

16:24.458 --> 16:25.458
-I see what you did.
-Yeah?

16:25.541 --> 16:27.083

Ooh. That makes so much sense.

16:44.416 --> 16:45.583
Well done.

-You did it. Yeah, great.

Oh, finally. It's Mom.

17:23.750 --> 17:24.916
Shit.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.416
Paul. Quick word?

17:31.375 --> 17:32.625
It was just a hug.

17:32.708 --> 17:35.041
The protocol is the protocol.

17:35.125 --> 17:38.666
If we soothe our patients,
they won't learn to self soothe.

17:38.750 --> 17:41.166
Would you pick up a baby
every time it cried?

17:42.791 --> 17:45.333
No. I wouldn't.

17:45.416 --> 17:47.333
I would...

17:47.416 --> 17:50.125
put the baby down.

17:50.208 --> 17:54.083
With extreme prejudice.

17:54.166 --> 17:56.250
You've broken the bond with Helen.

17:56.333 --> 17:58.500
My method of treating OCD,

17:58.583 --> 18:01.625
which may I remind you
is considered the gold standard,

18:01.708 --> 18:03.958
requires patients to confront their fears,

18:04.041 --> 18:09.250
to be alone with their discomfort
until they learn to comfort themselves.

18:09.333 --> 18:13.500

18:13.583 --> 18:20.000

with a Dallas.

29:40.125 --> 29:42.250
coffee service, tea service,

29:42.333 --> 29:43.750
a lobster risotto...

29:43.833 --> 29:45.875
-Gorgeous, yeah.
-...orange juice,

29:45.958 --> 29:48.750
one bottle of Veuve Clicquot,

29:48.833 --> 29:50.333
a yogurt parfait,

29:50.416 --> 29:51.958
the steak frites

29:52.041 --> 29:55.541
and two bottles of sauvignon blanc.

29:55.625 --> 29:57.083
Wonderful.

29:57.166 --> 30:00.666
We've never tried food before,
and we are very excited.

30:00.750 --> 30:02.750
Of course, miss.

30:03.791 --> 30:05.375
DENNIS:
Mmm.

30:05.458 --> 30:07.250
ALICE:
Mmm.

30:07.333 --> 30:09.166
What even time is it?

30:09.250 --> 30:12.375
Mm, must be, like, 3:30 in the afternoon.

30:12.458 --> 30:14.125
Oh, shit.

30:14.208 --> 30:17.208
I have to go to dinner
with my dumb family soon.

30:17.291 --> 30:18.958
Huh, better finish
all this breakfast, then.

30:19.041 --> 30:20.125
Oh, I'm going to.

30:20.208 --> 30:21.708
I'm gonna eat this. And this.

30:21.791 --> 30:22.916
That.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.333
I'm gonna head over due east.

30:25.416 --> 30:28.291
Then I might-- Don't even start here
'cause these are also mine.

30:28.375 --> 30:31.000
I'm gonna finish all of it, and if I barf,

30:31.083 --> 30:33.000
that will be no less than
what they deserve.

30:33.083 --> 30:34.833
Are you my dream girl?

30:34.916 --> 30:36.083
Please tell me you aren't married.

30:36.166 --> 30:38.583
-Shit. Jonathan.
-What?

30:38.666 --> 30:40.958
-Oh, no. Are you married?
-No. No, no.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.708
No, Jonathan is my rabbit.

30:43.791 --> 30:49.333
And I have to text someone-- uh,
my friend who's watching him-- real quick

30:49.416 --> 30:53.750
just to make sure
he has enough, um... um...

30:53.833 --> 30:55.583
-um...
-Carrots?

30:57.000 --> 30:58.458
Yeah. Carrots.

30:58.541 --> 31:01.708
Well, since I now know
that you have a rabbit

31:01.791 --> 31:05.333
and I still think that
you might be my dream girl,

31:05.416 --> 31:07.916
do you think I can
see you again while you're here?

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Sorry, what?

31:10.083 --> 31:12.166
I was asking you out.

31:12.250 --> 31:13.500
(phone chirps)

31:13.583 --> 31:14.583
Oh.

31:16.583 --> 31:17.708
Huh.

31:17.791 --> 31:19.875
♪ ♪

31:30.541 --> 31:32.125
Oh, God!

31:32.208 --> 31:33.291
Oh, sorry.

31:33.375 --> 31:34.833
Didn't mean to startle.

31:34.916 --> 31:37.041
That's okay. I thought you were Dominic.

31:37.125 --> 31:39.333
No, most decidedly not.

31:39.416 --> 31:40.791
(Paul sighs)

31:43.708 --> 31:48.541
So, do you always just barge into rooms
in your own house like this?

31:48.625 --> 31:51.166
Oh, yes. It's one of my worst habits.

31:51.250 --> 31:52.208
(chuckles)

31:52.291 --> 31:56.250
Ah, if I told you my worst habits,
I'd have to kill you.

31:56.333 --> 31:57.458
Ah.

31:57.541 --> 31:59.541
We better get going.

31:59.625 --> 32:00.833
Yes, of course.

32:00.916 --> 32:03.875
So, my driver will scoot you off
to your little family dinner,

32:03.958 --> 32:06.666
but tomorrow night, you two belong to me.

32:06.750 --> 32:09.333
-Yes, sir.
-Well, let's just remember that

32:09.416 --> 32:11.250
I'm going to look like
a little tiny pile of ashes

32:11.333 --> 32:14.958
after spending the evening with my family,
so you'll have to carry me out in an urn.

32:15.041 --> 32:16.958
(laughs) You're funny.

32:17.041 --> 32:18.125
He's funny.

32:18.208 --> 32:20.583
Mm, spend enough time with me,
it's bound to rub off.

32:21.833 --> 32:23.000
Mm.

32:23.083 --> 32:26.416
♪ My heart goes up, my heart goes down ♪

32:26.500 --> 32:28.333
-♪ We fall in love ♪
-(Eloise chuckles)

32:28.416 --> 32:29.791
♪ And we fall back out ♪

32:29.875 --> 32:32.208
♪ I'll give you anything you want... ♪

32:32.291 --> 32:35.125
I miss those days when
you were just a little baby, Ellie.

32:35.208 --> 32:38.375
But maybe soon we will have a grandchild.

32:39.541 --> 32:40.708
DONNA:
Slow down, Henrique.

32:40.791 --> 32:43.041
Let her enjoy her wedding first.

32:43.125 --> 32:44.958
What is it, Ellie? Is something wrong?

32:45.041 --> 32:47.541
I'm okay, Mum, just tired.

32:47.625 --> 32:50.166
Weddings can be stressful.

32:50.250 --> 32:51.875
Remember to breathe.

32:51.958 --> 32:53.541
(Eloise breathes deeply)

32:53.625 --> 32:56.416
My bitch!

32:56.500 --> 32:58.083
Yay!

33:02.833 --> 33:04.416
Oh, hi.

33:04.500 --> 33:06.625
-Oh, thank God you're here.
-Oh, my God.

33:06.708 --> 33:08.291
-Ugh.
-I can't believe that I am.

33:08.375 --> 33:10.208
-You remember Dom.
-Hi, Dom.

33:10.291 --> 33:11.833
(vehicle approaching)

33:13.000 --> 33:14.416
(laughs)

33:14.500 --> 33:16.375
Alice! Paul!

33:16.458 --> 33:18.208
(laughs)

33:18.291 --> 33:19.625
(Alice groans)

33:19.708 --> 33:21.833
-Paul.
-Good to see you, Mom.

33:21.916 --> 33:24.666
-Um, Dominic.
-Henrique.

33:24.750 --> 33:27.708
-Dominic, nice to see you again.
-Nice to see you again.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.791
(Eloise chuckles nervously)

33:32.333 --> 33:35.041
-Have you been waiting long?
-Oh, big-time.

33:36.416 --> 33:38.666
Well, I'll just go
check on the table, then.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.625
(Eloise and Donna laugh)

33:41.625 --> 33:44.000
(lively chatter)

33:44.083 --> 33:46.166
And you look the same,
and that's not fair.

33:46.250 --> 33:48.083
-Thank you.
-DONNA: Is it possible that, um,

33:48.166 --> 33:50.625
I'm still a little stoned? (chuckles)

33:50.708 --> 33:52.708
-(whispers): Did you see? She just paid.
-WAITER: White wine, madam.

33:52.791 --> 33:54.666
-You're hilarious.
-Please.

33:54.750 --> 33:56.125
-I got it. (laughs)
-Thank you.

33:56.208 --> 33:58.875
Let's not be shy, okay?

34:02.041 --> 34:03.541
-(clears throat)
-DONNA: Really.

34:03.625 --> 34:05.791
Everyone. Hello. (chuckles)

34:05.875 --> 34:10.291
First, I'd like to say thank you
from the bottom of my heart

34:10.375 --> 34:12.375
for coming to England for my nuptials.

34:12.458 --> 34:17.166
I know it was likely difficult
to press pause on your work and lives,

34:17.250 --> 34:19.041
and I so appreciate it.

34:19.125 --> 34:21.416
Now, sweetheart,
we wouldn't have dreamed of not coming.

34:21.500 --> 34:22.958
ELOISE:
So, cheers.

34:23.041 --> 34:24.583
-ALL: Cheers.
-(Eloise laughs)

34:26.333 --> 34:27.916
DONNA:
Paulie.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.041
Okay.

34:29.125 --> 34:34.000
And since it's been a little while
since we've all been together,

34:34.083 --> 34:38.958
I thought we'd play an icebreaker game
that I found online called

34:39.041 --> 34:40.750
-"Would You Rather."
-Oh.

34:40.833 --> 34:44.000
I played it with my team at work,
and they absolutely loved it.

34:44.083 --> 34:45.500
Oh, what do you do for work again?

34:45.583 --> 34:47.958
Oh, I'm a project manager
at Painted Wings.

34:48.041 --> 34:51.791
It's a foundation that encourages
the disadvantaged to enjoy art.

34:51.875 --> 34:53.541
(quietly):
I like to encourage them to enjoy food.

34:53.625 --> 34:55.291
-(Alice snickers)
-What was that, Paul?

34:55.375 --> 34:56.666
Mm.

34:56.750 --> 34:59.958
Alice had something disgusting
in her teeth. Ugh.

35:00.041 --> 35:01.291
'Cause I'm disgusting.

35:01.375 --> 35:05.083
Okay, I will start with Paul!

35:05.166 --> 35:07.666
-(Eloise laughs)
-At your own risk. (chuckles)

35:07.750 --> 35:09.416
Oh, this is a fun one.

35:09.500 --> 35:12.666
Would you rather be four-foot-five
or seven-foot-seven?

35:12.750 --> 35:14.083
Ooh, are we talking height or wiener?

35:14.166 --> 35:15.250
-DOMINIC: Paul.
-ALICE: Excellent follow-up.

35:15.333 --> 35:16.541
PAUL:
Excuse me. Thank you.

35:16.625 --> 35:18.166
-It's a fair question.
-It's very fair.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.541
PAUL:
Okay, definitely seven feet.

35:19.625 --> 35:23.500
I don't think there's a gay on the planet
that wants to be miniature,

35:23.583 --> 35:26.041
because then you run the risk
of an old crone coming along

35:26.125 --> 35:28.666
and snatching you up
and putting you in her glass menagerie

35:28.750 --> 35:30.000
along with her treasures.

35:30.083 --> 35:31.958
-(Paul chuckles)
-It's happened before.

35:32.041 --> 35:33.333
(clears throat) Alice.

35:33.416 --> 35:35.625
-Your turn.
-Would you rather be

35:35.708 --> 35:39.583
poor and work at a job you love
or rich and work at a job you hate?

35:39.666 --> 35:40.708
Rich and hate.

35:40.791 --> 35:43.041
Wait, Alice, you work at
Jonathan Walsh's company, right?

35:43.125 --> 35:44.458
Yep.

35:44.541 --> 35:46.375
Are you on the tech side or creative?

35:46.458 --> 35:48.708
Uh, I'm his assistant.

35:48.791 --> 35:50.916
Oh.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.666
Well... yay.

35:53.750 --> 35:55.833
ELOISE:
Alice is an extremely

35:55.916 --> 35:59.208
talented architect, and she'd be immensely
successful at it if she wanted to.

35:59.291 --> 36:01.375
I want to do what I'm doing.

36:01.458 --> 36:02.666
That's why I'm doing it.

36:02.750 --> 36:04.625
Sorry, I thought I was defending you.

36:04.708 --> 36:06.541
We can't all have rich papas.

36:06.625 --> 36:09.791
Some of us have to get non-volunteer jobs.

36:09.875 --> 36:11.583
I know that.

36:11.666 --> 36:12.916
Actually, not all of us have dads at all.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.333
Paul. That's too dark.

36:14.416 --> 36:16.458
Alice, the wine is spilling.

36:16.541 --> 36:18.041
You bet it is, Mom.

36:18.125 --> 36:20.250
El, hit us with another one. This is fun.

36:20.333 --> 36:21.750
PAUL:
Ooh, I'll go, I'll go.

36:21.833 --> 36:23.125
(babbles) Okay, Mom,

36:23.208 --> 36:25.625
off the top of my head, would you rather

36:25.708 --> 36:27.000
have your husband die

36:27.083 --> 36:30.458
or give away all his stuff without
asking us if we wanted any of it?

36:30.541 --> 36:33.291
Ooh, or both. Is that allowed?
Can you do both, Eloise?

36:33.375 --> 36:35.916
-(coughs) -Paul, you shouldn't
talk to your mother that way.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.458
Oh. I know that you're
very supportive of my mother.

36:38.541 --> 36:41.708
But also, isn't there a 19-year-old with
daddy issues in this restaurant somewhere

36:41.791 --> 36:44.041
whose self-esteem you should be
absolutely destroying?

36:44.125 --> 36:47.333
Do you have any more questions, El?
'Cause this is a fun icebreaker.

36:47.416 --> 36:48.500
I'm loving it.

36:48.583 --> 36:50.000
Oh, look! The food is here.

36:50.083 --> 36:51.333
-Oh. Mmm.
-Delicious.

36:51.416 --> 36:53.041
-Delish.
-Amazing.

36:53.125 --> 36:56.625
Well, so lovely having you all here.

36:56.708 --> 36:59.166
Only 72 hours till the big "I do."

36:59.250 --> 37:03.375
It's just so wonderful being here
together with my children

37:03.458 --> 37:04.666
and all their friends.

37:04.750 --> 37:07.500
Sorry, did you mean Dominic
when you said "friends," Mom?

37:07.583 --> 37:08.750
'Cause, you know, he's not my friend.

37:08.833 --> 37:10.000
He's my sexual lover.

37:10.083 --> 37:12.125
No, no, no. Not more of this.

37:12.208 --> 37:13.958
Paul, that was not directed at you.

37:14.041 --> 37:15.291
You know I support you.

37:15.375 --> 37:16.541
(vomits)

37:16.625 --> 37:18.375
-Oh, my God, Alice.
-ALICE: (coughs) I'm fine.

37:18.458 --> 37:20.875
I think I just had some bad chicken.

37:20.958 --> 37:22.125
We didn't have any chicken.

37:22.208 --> 37:24.041
Poor thing.

37:24.125 --> 37:25.583
(Alice retching)

37:25.666 --> 37:26.708
Excuse me, sir?

37:26.791 --> 37:28.208
-Yes?
-You see this man here?

37:28.291 --> 37:29.875
-MAN: Uh, yes.
-DONNA: Well, he's my son.

37:29.958 --> 37:32.583
-What's happening?
-And Dominic here is not just his friend.

37:32.666 --> 37:34.208
-No. Mom.
-He's his boyfriend.

37:34.291 --> 37:35.458
Or, uh, lover. Or partner.

37:35.541 --> 37:36.708
-Okay.
-They do sex things.

37:36.791 --> 37:38.708
-Ooh.
-He puts it in his butt.

37:38.791 --> 37:41.166
-No, that's not-- that's...
-Or maybe he puts it in his butt.

37:41.250 --> 37:42.375
-Oh, this is so much worse.
-It doesn't matter.

37:42.458 --> 37:43.791
It's A-OK with me.

37:43.875 --> 37:46.416
I want to tell him my son is gay
and I'm proud,

37:46.500 --> 37:47.875
and I always have been.

37:47.958 --> 37:49.375
Very proud.

37:50.458 --> 37:51.458
Eloise.

37:52.791 --> 37:55.083
Oh. Hello, Tom.

37:55.166 --> 37:56.291
Ha!

37:56.375 --> 37:57.875
Everyone, this is Tom.

37:57.958 --> 37:59.041
We work together.

37:59.125 --> 38:02.083
Oh, good.
Mom was just explaining anal sex to him.

38:03.958 --> 38:05.291
Tom, this is, this is my family.

38:05.375 --> 38:06.916
I'm the proud father.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.708
I would be. (chuckles)

38:08.791 --> 38:10.625
Well, it's, uh, it's lovely
to meet you all.

38:10.708 --> 38:13.666
And, uh, congratulations
on the whole, uh, gay shebang.

38:13.750 --> 38:16.000
Um, everyone's doing it.

38:16.083 --> 38:17.291
(clears throat)

38:17.375 --> 38:19.791
Well, I'll see you at the wedding, Eloise.

38:20.791 --> 38:21.958
Did he just congratulate you
for being gay?

38:22.041 --> 38:23.166
-Straight up.
-No!

38:23.250 --> 38:25.250
Shush.

38:25.333 --> 38:26.916
All of you.

38:27.000 --> 38:31.333
I'm going to assume that all of your
absolutely outrageous behavior tonight

38:31.416 --> 38:35.291
can be attributed to jet lag
and not some sort of advanced rot

38:35.375 --> 38:36.875
occurring in each of your minds.

38:36.958 --> 38:38.458
But heed my words.

57:08.750 --> 57:12.916
I thought I was gonna be stuck next to
some creepy, gross businessman

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
who was just gonna fart his way
across the Atlantic.

57:15.083 --> 57:16.541
-(laughing)
-That would've been so cool for you.

57:16.625 --> 57:20.083
Instead... instead, it was you,

57:20.166 --> 57:23.958
this sassy, gorgeous woman.

57:25.791 --> 57:27.500
(sighs)

57:27.583 --> 57:28.875

57:28.958 --> 57:30.583
Dennis.

57:30.666 --> 57:31.833
Dennis Bottoms.

57:31.916 --> 57:32.958
What?

57:35.333 --> 57:38.000
-What, what? -Yeah, no, I shouldn't,
I shouldn't have told you that.

57:38.083 --> 57:39.083
-Wait, wait, wait.
-(groans)

57:39.166 --> 57:41.500
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

57:41.583 --> 57:42.791
Your last name is Bottoms?

57:42.875 --> 57:44.833
-I-I shouldn't have told you.
-Oh, wow.

57:44.916 --> 57:46.041
No, I-- That was a mistake.

57:46.125 --> 57:47.291
No, it's perfect.

57:47.375 --> 57:49.083
-Oh, God.
-(laughs) Okay.

57:49.166 --> 57:51.083
Well...

57:51.166 --> 57:54.500
Mr. Bottoms... (snickers)

57:54.583 --> 57:58.166
would you make me
the happiest woman in the world

57:58.250 --> 58:03.833

rehearsal dinner and wedding with me?

58:05.416 --> 58:07.875

Okay, but I'm not putting out.

59:04.541 --> 59:06.125
Dominic, I wasn't apologizing.

59:06.208 --> 59:08.875
I feel awful because you talked me into
doing a stupid threesome.

59:08.958 --> 59:10.666
You always talk me into shit,

59:10.750 --> 59:13.791
like moving to Philly
and-and taking that stupid job

59:13.875 --> 59:17.500
and watching Project Runway
after Tim and Heidi left.

59:17.583 --> 59:19.000
It's still good.

59:19.083 --> 59:20.583
And now a threesome.

59:20.666 --> 59:22.208
There's nothing shameful
about a threesome, okay?

59:22.291 --> 59:23.541
Calm down.

59:23.625 --> 59:25.500
I'm not ashamed.

59:25.583 --> 59:27.875
I'm hurt, Dominic.
I feel like I'm not enough for you.

59:27.958 --> 59:29.083
I'm never enough for you.

59:29.166 --> 59:30.916
And I try so hard.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.541
God, I try so hard to impress you.

59:32.625 --> 59:34.416
And you can't see me, you know?

59:34.500 --> 59:36.791
Dominic, you can't see me!

59:36.875 --> 59:39.208
-We can hear you.
-England hates me!

59:41.875 --> 59:43.625
I think I'd like to break up with you now.

59:44.708 --> 59:47.125
Are you fucking kidding me?!
You're breaking up with me?!

59:47.208 --> 59:49.083
-Yes.
-Oh, fuck.

59:49.166 --> 59:50.916
DOMINIC:
I have feelings for Alcott,

59:51.000 --> 59:53.416
and I'd like to explore them
with my tongue.

59:53.500 --> 59:54.666
Oh.

59:54.750 --> 1:00:00.250
Sounds gorgeous, but, um,
I'm actually kind of interested in Paul.

1:00:01.333 --> 1:00:04.666
Oh, my G-- That's so nice. That's so nice.

1:00:04.750 --> 1:00:07.041
I mean, no.
No, thank you, but that's so nice.

1:00:07.125 --> 1:00:08.458
Well, that's weird.

1:00:08.541 --> 1:00:10.333
Oh, my God!

1:00:10.416 --> 1:00:13.000
(grunts) I do beg your pardon.
Uh, Dominic?

1:00:13.083 --> 1:00:14.375
Yes. Do I know you?

1:00:14.458 --> 1:00:16.458
It's Tom. We met the other night.

1:00:16.541 --> 1:00:20.041
If you're thinking of a threesome,
just fucking don't.

1:00:21.041 --> 1:00:22.791
(groans):
Oh, God.

1:00:24.041 --> 1:00:27.791
So I'll just go grab the rest of my stuff
and then you'll come get me?

1:00:27.875 --> 1:00:30.708
Yeah. My sister arranged a car,
which is probably a Bentley or something,

1:00:30.791 --> 1:00:34.625
and we'll ride with my mom and my brother,
who are a mess.

1:00:34.708 --> 1:00:38.125
And my brother's boyfriend Dominic,
who's a turd.

1:00:38.208 --> 1:00:40.541
I can't wait to meet my future in-laws.

1:00:43.458 --> 1:00:45.916
(phone chirping)

1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:47.833
Oh, my God.

1:00:47.916 --> 1:00:49.041
"Love you"?

1:00:49.125 --> 1:00:50.625
Everything okay?

1:00:50.708 --> 1:00:52.875
I just got a text from...

1:00:53.958 --> 1:00:56.500
...um, my sister, who is awful,

1:00:56.583 --> 1:01:01.500
and she said that I cannot have a plus-one
to the rehearsal dinner or the wedding.

1:01:03.541 --> 1:01:06.166
Oh. Wow.

1:01:06.250 --> 1:01:07.458
-Really?
-Yeah.

1:01:07.541 --> 1:01:09.208
She's the worst.

1:01:10.416 --> 1:01:11.500
(sputtering sigh)

1:01:12.875 --> 1:01:14.708
So what time's Jonathan getting in?

1:01:15.791 --> 1:01:18.333
-No, uh, it's not... it-it wasn't...
-No, please don't.

1:01:18.416 --> 1:01:21.083
D-Don't. Uh...

1:01:21.166 --> 1:01:23.083
It's okay. I get it.

1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.666
You know, Alice...

1:01:29.958 --> 1:01:32.666
...first you were mean to me,

1:01:32.750 --> 1:01:35.083
then you were super drunk,

1:01:35.166 --> 1:01:37.750
then you slept with me,
then you stole all of my pancakes,

1:01:37.833 --> 1:01:40.333
pretended that your married lover
was a rabbit,

1:01:40.416 --> 1:01:44.416
turned me down for some rich asshole
who's banging you on the side,

1:01:44.500 --> 1:01:47.708
then drew me back in,
invited me to your sister's wedding,

1:01:47.791 --> 1:01:50.791
then ditched me for a rabbit again.

1:01:50.875 --> 1:01:52.833
And despite that...

1:01:53.916 --> 1:01:55.000
...I really like you.

1:01:56.500 --> 1:02:02.125
Because you have literally everything
that any sane, decent man could ever want.

1:02:02.208 --> 1:02:06.833
You are smart and funny
and beautiful and nice.

1:02:06.916 --> 1:02:08.125
Occasionally.

1:02:09.666 --> 1:02:12.166
But you don't want a sane, decent man.

1:02:13.166 --> 1:02:14.750
You want someone
who makes you feel like shit.

1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:18.250
Because you think you are shit.

1:02:19.666 --> 1:02:21.416
That's really sad.

1:02:22.500 --> 1:02:23.791
Wow.

1:02:25.333 --> 1:02:28.375
You should, like, put that
on a coffee mug or something.

1:02:29.541 --> 1:02:31.250
Come on, Alice.

1:02:31.333 --> 1:02:33.583
We both know that's way too long
to put on a mug.

1:02:38.125 --> 1:02:41.208
Good luck with your discount
Mark Zuckerberg motherfucker, Alice.

1:02:41.291 --> 1:02:42.916
Hope it's worth it.

1:06:16.875 --> 1:06:18.291
Actually, can we pull over?

1:06:18.375 --> 1:06:19.916
Can we please, can we please pull over?

-Okay?

1:06:55.958 --> 1:06:58.125
Oh, my God. Is it okay?

1:06:58.208 --> 1:07:00.291
Hello. I-I'm sorry.

1:07:00.375 --> 1:07:02.666

1:07:46.583 --> 1:07:47.791
(Cockney accent):
Well, 'ello, gov'na.

1:07:47.875 --> 1:07:49.250
Fancy a crumpet?

1:07:49.333 --> 1:07:50.500

(laughs) I'm just kidding.

1:07:50.583 --> 1:07:51.583
I'm kidding, you guys.

1:07:51.666 --> 1:07:54.375
-(chuckles) -Uh, Paul, these are
my parents, Marjory and Frederic.

1:07:54.458 --> 1:07:55.833
This is Paul, Eloise's brother.

1:07:55.916 --> 1:07:57.458
Well, half brother.

1:07:57.541 --> 1:08:02.333
Um, and as you can see, I'm flying solo,
because I was dumped yesterday.

1:08:02.416 --> 1:08:04.541
Yes, of course.
Very sorry to hear about you and Dominic.

1:08:04.625 --> 1:08:07.875
Well, turns out, Marj and Fred,
I'm pretty terrible at threesomes.

1:08:07.958 --> 1:08:09.666
(chuckles):
Know what I mean?

1:08:09.750 --> 1:08:11.666
Aren't we all? (chuckles)

1:08:11.750 --> 1:08:13.541
Well, I was more than willing,
is the thing, you know?

1:08:13.625 --> 1:08:15.625
I was down to clown, as the kids say.

1:08:15.708 --> 1:08:17.958
So on my hands and knees,
really sort of arching,

1:08:18.041 --> 1:08:19.500
um, and Alcott comes in--

1:08:19.583 --> 1:08:21.500
that was our third, the sort of
special guest star, if you will--

1:08:21.583 --> 1:08:24.291
and he decided that he was feeling
a little bit snacky.

1:08:24.375 --> 1:08:26.791
-Um...
-Would you excuse us for just one moment?

1:08:26.875 --> 1:08:27.958
Rude.

1:08:29.041 --> 1:08:31.500
Well, now, what do you suppose
happened next?

1:08:31.583 --> 1:08:34.125
After the other young man got snacky?

1:08:34.208 --> 1:08:35.416
Uh...

1:08:35.500 --> 1:08:38.750
This is my only nice suit. God.

1:08:38.833 --> 1:08:40.750
-What is your bloody problem?
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

1:08:40.833 --> 1:08:42.458
Was I getting a little too real for you?

1:08:42.541 --> 1:08:46.250
You just told my future in-laws about your
failed threesome at my rehearsal dinner,

1:08:46.333 --> 1:08:49.000
so, yes, it was
a little too much for me today, Paul.

1:08:49.083 --> 1:08:51.291
-Uh, sorry. Sorry.
-Come on, Eloise.

1:08:51.375 --> 1:08:53.333
It doesn't matter what I say, okay?

1:08:53.416 --> 1:08:55.708
You liked me when I was a little baby
that you could boss around,

1:08:55.791 --> 1:08:57.750
and now you don't,
you don't want any part of

1:08:57.833 --> 1:08:59.875
actual, real, messy, grown-up Paul, okay?

1:08:59.958 --> 1:09:04.375
I'm very sorry that I can't be this
gorgeous, classy, stuck-up adult like you.

1:09:04.458 --> 1:09:05.916
Oh, you're being such an ass.

1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:07.791
Oh, really? I'm being an ass? Am I really?

1:09:07.875 --> 1:09:10.833
Well, at least I didn't leave
my own sister high and dry

1:09:10.916 --> 1:09:13.250
after her boyfriend abandoned her
because she had a miscarriage

1:09:13.333 --> 1:09:14.625
that he blamed on her.

1:09:14.708 --> 1:09:15.791
What are you talking about?

1:09:15.875 --> 1:09:18.041
He blamed her? That's why they split up?

1:09:18.125 --> 1:09:20.500
Yeah, and I flew out there
and visited her, okay?

1:09:20.583 --> 1:09:21.583
I used my miles.

1:09:21.666 --> 1:09:23.291
And I get it, okay? I get it.

1:09:23.375 --> 1:09:26.083
Hey, why would you want
to spend any time with us, right?

1:09:26.166 --> 1:09:29.125
You were always
the beautiful, wanted child,

1:09:29.208 --> 1:09:31.416
-and we were just Mom's second,
less lovable family. -(fingers snap)

1:09:31.500 --> 1:09:37.000
Now Mom is throwing herself at Henrique
like some desperate teenager.

1:09:37.083 --> 1:09:38.708
Jesus Christ. Ugh, God.

1:09:38.791 --> 1:09:42.708
I'm so, so thankful that my dad
is too dead to see any of this.

1:09:42.791 --> 1:09:44.666
Well, I hate to break it to you, Paul,

1:09:44.750 --> 1:09:46.708
but your father was an ass, too,
just like mine.

1:09:46.791 --> 1:09:48.041
I guess it's sort of Mum's type.

1:09:48.125 --> 1:09:51.125
Okay. You have no right
to talk about my dad like that.

1:09:51.208 --> 1:09:55.166
He was a wonderful man, and he loved me,
and I've been lost without him.

1:09:55.250 --> 1:09:57.041
What can you possibly still need to get?!

1:09:57.125 --> 1:09:58.666
Oh, sorry, just this. It's cake.

1:09:58.750 --> 1:10:01.208
Oh, God, Paul, you're so off base.

1:10:01.291 --> 1:10:02.875
-(scoffs)
-The truth is,

1:10:02.958 --> 1:10:05.291
when you came out to your parents,
Bill couldn't handle it.

1:10:05.375 --> 1:10:07.416
He said he thought it was disgusting,

1:10:07.500 --> 1:10:10.333
and Mum told him she would leave him
if he ever made you feel

1:10:10.416 --> 1:10:12.666
even the slightest bit unloved
or unaccepted.

1:10:12.750 --> 1:10:16.250
She protected you from him,
even after he died,

1:10:16.333 --> 1:10:18.375
and you've been nothing but awful
to her ever since.

1:10:19.666 --> 1:10:21.541
-That's not true.
-It is.

1:10:23.458 --> 1:10:26.041
No, he said that,
he s-said that he was fine with it.

1:10:26.125 --> 1:10:29.416
He said that he loved me no matter what.

1:10:29.500 --> 1:10:31.458
-He told me that.
-Mum made him say that.

1:10:31.541 --> 1:10:33.666
No, she did-- No, you're just m--
you're making things up.

1:10:33.750 --> 1:10:35.666
I wish I were, Paul.

1:10:35.750 --> 1:10:37.375
Mum loves you.

1:10:37.458 --> 1:10:39.083
She was a fucking warrior for you.

1:10:42.583 --> 1:10:44.083
Paul!

1:10:45.083 --> 1:10:47.083
(sobbing)

1:10:50.083 --> 1:10:51.166
You all right, mate?

1:10:51.250 --> 1:10:52.500
(stammers)

1:10:52.583 --> 1:10:54.833
Yeah. Yeah. I'm okay, thank you.

1:10:54.916 --> 1:10:55.958
Yeah, okay.

1:10:56.041 --> 1:10:58.416
Wait, if you have a chance,
could you just bring some of those

1:10:58.500 --> 1:11:00.625
-little cheese puffy things?
-Yeah, okay.

1:11:00.708 --> 1:11:02.083
And maybe just, like, a little white wine.

1:11:02.166 --> 1:11:04.541
-Sure.
-Okay, but not chardonnay.

1:11:07.500 --> 1:11:09.333
That-- yes, well, okay.

1:11:09.416 --> 1:11:11.708
(silverware tapping glass)

1:11:11.791 --> 1:11:15.916
Thanks, everyone,
for coming tonight to witness this woman

1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:18.291
-making the biggest mistake of her life.
-(phone buzzing)

1:11:18.375 --> 1:11:20.041
(laughter)

1:11:20.125 --> 1:11:23.958
I met Eloise at the polo club,
and when I told my brother

1:11:24.041 --> 1:11:26.000
I'd just seen the most beautiful girl
in the world,

1:11:26.083 --> 1:11:29.916
-he thought I was talking about
one of the horses. -(laughter)

1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:33.791
Thankfully, a similar mix-up
has not occurred here today.

1:11:33.875 --> 1:11:36.208
-You!
-(crowd gasps)

1:11:36.291 --> 1:11:38.583
-Alice.
-No.

1:11:39.875 --> 1:11:41.250
I mean, yes, I-I'm me, but--

1:11:41.333 --> 1:11:43.500
Hi. Marissa, welcome.

1:11:43.583 --> 1:11:45.500
Don't try to be cute right now.

1:11:45.583 --> 1:11:48.375
Why don't, uh, let...
why don't you and I go outside?

1:11:48.458 --> 1:11:51.958
No, no. I-I actually think
maybe it could be fun for everybody here

1:11:52.041 --> 1:11:53.666
to know that this person--

1:11:53.750 --> 1:11:56.875
and I use that word very loosely--

1:11:56.958 --> 1:11:59.541
has been fucking my husband...

1:11:59.625 --> 1:12:01.125
(crowd gasping, murmuring)

1:12:01.208 --> 1:12:03.791
...while I have been home nursing a baby

1:12:03.875 --> 1:12:07.333
who just vampires
the life force out of me...

1:12:07.416 --> 1:12:09.625
Marissa, I'm sorry. Jonathan said that...

1:12:09.708 --> 1:12:11.833
And I'm supposed to only blame him
for all of this, right?

1:12:11.916 --> 1:12:13.791
Wrong. You're a woman.

1:12:13.875 --> 1:12:15.208
-Okay.
-You should've known better.

1:12:15.291 --> 1:12:16.833
-You know how this feels.
-(Alice stammering)

1:12:16.916 --> 1:12:18.666
Uh, why don't we just go outside,

1:12:18.750 --> 1:12:20.750
-and we can talk and...
-No. No.

1:12:20.833 --> 1:12:24.166
I am so tired of talking

1:12:24.250 --> 1:12:28.166
to therapists and to sleep experts

1:12:28.250 --> 1:12:32.000
and to my dumb piece of shit husband!

1:12:32.083 --> 1:12:33.250
-I'm divorcing Jonathan!
-(crowd gasping)

1:12:33.333 --> 1:12:36.291
Yes.
I mean, I-I think you should 'cause we--

1:12:36.375 --> 1:12:39.958
he screwed both of us over,
and we're the victims here.

1:12:40.041 --> 1:12:42.333
But first I'm gonna fistfight you.

1:12:42.416 --> 1:12:44.416
(crowd murmuring)

1:12:44.500 --> 1:12:47.750
Get back here, Strawberry Shortcake.

1:12:49.125 --> 1:12:50.500
I haven't slept in four days.

1:12:50.583 --> 1:12:52.458
-I'm invincible!
-Stop this. Alice, stop this.

1:12:52.541 --> 1:12:54.208
How am I supposed to stop it?

1:12:56.875 --> 1:12:58.875
(Henrique and woman laughing)

1:13:05.458 --> 1:13:07.458
(Henrique moaning)

1:13:12.958 --> 1:13:14.875
-(woman laughs)
-(pants unzip)

1:13:17.291 --> 1:13:18.416
(gasps)

1:13:18.500 --> 1:13:20.375
Paul, are you peeing on my feet?!

1:13:20.458 --> 1:13:23.375
(mocking French accent):
Uh, je m'appelle yes.

1:13:23.458 --> 1:13:25.916
-Merde! (shouting in French)
-(normal voice): What? Hey! Hey!

1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:27.333
MARISSA:
Get 'em up! Get 'em up!

1:13:27.416 --> 1:13:29.250
-ALICE: Can you call security, please?
-MARISSA: Don't call security!

1:13:29.333 --> 1:13:32.000
-PAUL: Sorry.
-(Henrique shouting in French)

1:13:32.083 --> 1:13:33.791
(crowd gasping)

1:13:33.875 --> 1:13:36.000
-Paul!
-Oh, my God.

1:13:36.083 --> 1:13:37.583
Oh, shit.

1:13:37.666 --> 1:13:39.541
MARISSA:
Alice, I'm gonna fuck you up!

1:13:39.625 --> 1:13:42.083
-No.
-Alice, who's that lady?

1:13:42.166 --> 1:13:43.666
(grunting)

1:13:50.208 --> 1:13:52.125
-No.
-(grunting)

1:13:53.041 --> 1:13:54.041
Oh.

1:13:55.166 --> 1:13:56.833
-Oh.
-ALICE: Stop.

1:13:56.916 --> 1:13:58.250
Stop. Marissa.

1:13:59.416 --> 1:14:00.791
(crowd gasping)

1:14:00.875 --> 1:14:02.125
Oh, hell no.

1:14:02.208 --> 1:14:04.083
Oh, um, Mum, no!

1:14:04.166 --> 1:14:05.125
Get her, Mom!

1:14:05.208 --> 1:14:07.291
Mom, no biting! No biting!

1:14:12.916 --> 1:14:15.583
(Donna laughing)

1:14:20.500 --> 1:14:22.791
Are... are you having a stroke?

1:14:22.875 --> 1:14:25.875
I mean, do you think this is funny?

1:14:27.458 --> 1:14:30.083
I do. I mean, kind of, yes.

1:14:30.166 --> 1:14:31.291
(laughing)

1:14:31.375 --> 1:14:34.125
Mom, you bit someone.

1:14:34.208 --> 1:14:35.666
I did.

1:14:35.750 --> 1:14:36.958
(laughs)

1:14:37.041 --> 1:14:38.833
And I don't know
what kind of lotion she uses,

1:14:38.916 --> 1:14:40.541
but it was honestly kind of pleasant.

1:14:40.625 --> 1:14:45.041
She did smell amazing,
so I'm not shocked that she tasted good.

1:14:45.125 --> 1:14:47.416
-(Donna laughs)
-You guys are so weird.

1:14:47.500 --> 1:14:49.875
Oh, my God.

1:14:49.958 --> 1:14:52.041
You know how at every wedding
there are those people?

1:14:52.125 --> 1:14:53.958
The people everyone talk about after.

1:14:54.041 --> 1:14:58.375
The drunk uncle, the-the cousin
who humps everyone on the dance floor.

1:14:58.458 --> 1:14:59.708
Cousin Randy.

1:14:59.791 --> 1:15:01.500
-Ew.
-Every time.

1:15:02.583 --> 1:15:04.833
We're those people this time.

1:15:06.125 --> 1:15:07.250
We're those people.

1:15:07.333 --> 1:15:09.625
Oh, savage, Mom.

1:15:09.708 --> 1:15:11.250
Ouch.

1:15:12.250 --> 1:15:14.166
(chuckles)

1:15:14.250 --> 1:15:15.375
(sighs)

1:15:18.500 --> 1:15:20.000
Hey, Mom?

1:15:20.083 --> 1:15:21.291
Mm, yes, Paulie?

1:15:31.125 --> 1:15:35.833
I'm sorry that I've been
such a terrible garbage heap of a son.

1:15:36.916 --> 1:15:40.000
No, Paulie, you are wonderful.

1:15:41.583 --> 1:15:44.291
I just can't believe that Dad...

1:15:44.375 --> 1:15:45.666
I know, sweetie.

1:15:48.333 --> 1:15:50.291
Why didn't you tell me?

1:15:53.708 --> 1:15:56.125
Because you loved him.

1:15:56.208 --> 1:15:58.541
And you felt that he loved you
unconditionally,

1:15:58.625 --> 1:16:02.041
and it's so rare to feel loved that way.

1:16:02.125 --> 1:16:03.916
And I didn't want to destroy that.

1:16:07.291 --> 1:16:11.125
And I'm sorry about Henrique

1:16:18.041 --> 1:16:19.083
It's fine.

1:16:19.166 --> 1:16:23.708
Well, you deserve to be loved
unconditionally, too.

1:16:27.333 --> 1:16:29.416
I already am.

Yes.

1:16:40.958 --> 1:16:43.125
So are we being released?

1:16:43.208 --> 1:16:44.416
No.

1:16:44.500 --> 1:16:46.583
But she left a note for you.

1:16:46.666 --> 1:16:47.750
A-A note?

1:16:47.833 --> 1:16:49.416
She wanted me to read it to you.

1:16:49.500 --> 1:16:51.625
-Well, no, we can just read it oursel...
-(clears throat)

1:16:51.708 --> 1:16:52.708
Okay, you're gonna do it.

1:16:52.791 --> 1:16:54.708
"Dear Mum, Alice and Paul,

1:16:54.791 --> 1:16:59.291
I love you all, but I have changed
your RSVPs for tomorrow to no."

Huh.

Don't like to see that, do you?

1:20:35.541 --> 1:20:36.708
I was your first love.

1:20:36.791 --> 1:20:40.958
And I was a kind, good woman
who honestly loved you, and you blew that.

1:20:41.041 --> 1:20:44.791
And ever since then, you've been trying
to fill the massive space that I left

1:20:44.875 --> 1:20:48.416

1:20:48.500 --> 1:20:52.791

as having someone who actually cared.

And now, you know what,
your life is almost over.

1:20:55.833 --> 1:20:58.000
You got what, 15 years left?

1:20:58.083 --> 1:21:02.250

I'm sorry I showed you a glimpse of what
life is like when you treat people well,

1:21:13.333 --> 1:21:16.000
when you hold on
to the tiny parcel of love you are given

1:21:16.083 --> 1:21:17.666

Apparently, she had some sort of meltdown
at a candle store and then ran away.

I have no idea where she could be.

1:24:53.375 --> 1:24:54.833

Yep. Her favorite.

1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:46.916
I promise I had no idea because...

1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:48.583
I know, because I didn't tell you.

1:25:48.666 --> 1:25:52.458
And I hated you for it,
and it wasn't your fault.

1:25:53.541 --> 1:25:55.583
There's a little more to it
than that, though, too.

1:25:55.666 --> 1:25:56.708

compared to you guys,
I had this kind of half life.

1:26:28.833 --> 1:26:30.583
And in my heart, I always thought,

1:26:30.666 --> 1:26:36.166
"Well, I'll have a family of my own
someday, and we will be connected."

1:26:36.250 --> 1:26:37.666
Truly connected.

1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:41.541
And in an instant, that dream was gone.

1:26:41.625 --> 1:26:43.416
I'm really sorry.

1:26:43.500 --> 1:26:44.916
It wasn't your fault.

1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:46.666
No, I should have told you.

1:26:46.750 --> 1:26:50.833
Instead, I just tried to make it up to you
by upgrading your room

1:26:50.916 --> 1:26:53.000
-and trying to get you a job and...

He doesn't know
that I can't have children, and...

1:27:18.125 --> 1:27:20.541
I've been lying to him,
and he thinks I'm perfect.

1:27:20.625 --> 1:27:22.208

1:27:22.291 --> 1:27:24.708
