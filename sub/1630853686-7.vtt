00:12.303 --> 00:13.763
Holy shit.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.558
You're dead.
Which means…

00:17.600 --> 00:18.768
I'm alive?

00:19.352 --> 00:20.687
Boo, bitch.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.816
Why is dead you wearing my shoes?

00:24.899 --> 00:27.068
It was the best option
I could come up with on the fly

00:27.152 --> 00:28.403
to make you think you were dead.

00:28.486 --> 00:30.405
We're young. Our lives are just beginning.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.115
Yes. And we're gonna be remembered.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.410
From now on, let's promise
to live our lives without giving any fu…

00:57.015 --> 01:00.143
You made me think I was dead on purpose?

01:00.226 --> 01:02.520
-I didn't know what to do.
-And the flickering lights?

01:02.604 --> 01:05.315
Yeah, that was me. Sometimes I could
control it, sometimes I couldn't.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.234
I was worried that,
if the one time you took a chance,

01:08.318 --> 01:10.862
your best friend got brained,
you'd never take another risk.

01:10.945 --> 01:13.364
I didn't want you
to be Helen Who for the rest of your life.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.533
Better to live my entire life
thinking I'm a ghost!

01:15.617 --> 01:17.160
Was it the best plan? No.

01:17.243 --> 01:19.079
I was still trying
to figure out things myself,

01:19.162 --> 01:20.330
so we figured it out together.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.083
No. We didn't figure out anything!
You did!

01:23.166 --> 01:25.877
I wasn't thinking straight.
It's a bit lonely,

01:25.960 --> 01:28.379
dying and not being able
to tell anyone about it.

01:28.463 --> 01:31.049
-You ghostlit me!
-I did it to protect you.

01:31.132 --> 01:34.427
After I saw you stepping out and living
your best life, I didn't want you to stop.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.429
And you didn't stop,
because my plan was working,

01:36.513 --> 01:37.847
which is why I didn't come clean.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.141
No. That's more ghostlighting.

01:40.225 --> 01:43.728
You didn't come clean because you thought
that I couldn't live my life without you!

01:43.812 --> 01:46.022
Are you really so caught up
in your own shit

01:46.106 --> 01:48.691
that you can't make up
with your dead best friend?

01:48.775 --> 01:50.527
You are such a bitch!

01:50.610 --> 01:53.446
-You pushed me to be this way.
-No, I didn't!

01:53.530 --> 01:56.658
I pushed you to live fearlessly.
The bitch part, that is all on you!

01:56.741 --> 01:59.494
You… think that this bitch

01:59.577 --> 02:01.329
can't live her life without you?

02:01.871 --> 02:03.414
Watch me!

02:04.040 --> 02:05.416
You are dead to me!

02:17.011 --> 02:20.181
-It's a new day, Erika Vu. YOLOOT.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.228
Make way for the main character, bitches.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.691
You are serving.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.364
Dibs on Erika's earbuds!

02:39.159 --> 02:42.579
You sure you wanna be hugging
a whiny little bitch right now?

02:42.662 --> 02:43.663
What?

02:43.746 --> 02:46.833
The prom assembly.
You called me a WLB, Erika.

02:46.916 --> 02:48.126
-I said that?
-Yeah.

02:48.209 --> 02:50.378
That doesn't even sound like
something I'd say.

02:50.962 --> 02:53.798
Are you sure I would say that?
No… I don't think I said that.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.302
I'm so excited to spend the summer
with my boyfriend.

02:59.220 --> 03:00.221
Boy… Boyfriend?

03:00.305 --> 03:02.807
Mm-hm. Yeah, and there's so much
we can do now.

03:02.891 --> 03:05.435
Well, now that I have summer,
we can go swimming,

03:05.518 --> 03:07.645
have bonfires, kickbacks, minigolf,

03:07.729 --> 03:08.813
sex.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.900
And, I don't even have to worry
about something going wrong. Yeah.

03:11.983 --> 03:13.860
I mean, as long as we wear a condom, but…

03:14.861 --> 03:16.029
You, uh…

03:16.112 --> 03:19.032
You're ready for… for sex?

03:19.115 --> 03:21.075
-Yeah. I'm not just ready.
-Mm.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.161
I'm high-key ready.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.288
-Oh.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.291
There's my BuzzFeed interview. Gotta go.

03:31.878 --> 03:35.757
<i>-At least 23 schools have canceled prom.</i>

03:35.840 --> 03:37.842
<i>I mean, this is a movement,</i>

03:37.926 --> 03:39.969
<i>and you're the de facto leader.</i>

03:40.053 --> 03:44.390
<i>How do you feel, knowing you've had</i>
<i>such an impact on teens' lives?</i>

03:44.474 --> 03:46.309
Well, it's not about me per se.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.811
It's about how prom is problematic,

03:48.895 --> 03:51.397
but BT-dubs, no one was saying it
until I did.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.025
I'm just giving a voice to my generation.

03:54.108 --> 03:57.195
<i>So you'd say this was a selfless act?</i>

03:57.278 --> 03:59.072
-Totally selfless.
<i>-Great, um…</i>

03:59.155 --> 04:02.075
<i>Okay. Oh, could you send me</i>
<i>a selfie of you?</i>

04:02.158 --> 04:04.786
<i>You know, in a prom dress.</i>
<i>Just to publish with the article.</i>

04:04.869 --> 04:07.664
I don't have a prom dress,
because I'm not going to prom.

04:07.747 --> 04:11.084
<i>Oh, right. Well, we'll send you something.</i>

04:11.167 --> 04:14.254
Cool. I look good in sleeveless tulle
with a mermaid silhouette.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.339
<i>Okay. All right. Thank you, Erika.</i>

04:19.384 --> 04:22.595
This is a super high-quality ribbon.

04:22.679 --> 04:25.139
They did not cheap out at all here.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.058
It's a really nice touch.

04:27.141 --> 04:29.686
And the lid is off. It's off!

04:32.230 --> 04:33.898
Oh!

04:34.482 --> 04:38.653
<i>I am so into this '80s vibe.</i>

04:38.736 --> 04:41.447
<i> I will do an '80s fashion show vid</i>

04:41.531 --> 04:43.491
<i>once I hit 250K subscribers.</i>

04:43.574 --> 04:46.286
So make sure that you share and follow.

04:46.369 --> 04:49.163
What the hell?
Why are you buying all this crap?

04:49.247 --> 04:52.500
-You're ruining my unboxing video.
-You're ruining my bank account.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.585
I didn't buy any of this.
It's all influencer swag.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.170
Calm down.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.423
<i>Have some CBD mist.</i>

04:58.506 --> 05:01.676
Oh! Ew! You can't
spritz your way out of this.

05:01.759 --> 05:02.802
You're in serious trouble.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.929
Okay, I can't even right now
with your mood.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.015
I'm actually going to be
making money off of this.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.309
Well, you know what?
You better be making money fast.

05:09.892 --> 05:10.852
What's that?

05:10.935 --> 05:14.522
-It's your emergency credit card bill.
-For $15,000.

05:14.605 --> 05:16.691
$3,000 for ice.

05:16.774 --> 05:19.944
Yeah. And not cool ice, like diamonds ice.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.488
Just regular frozen water!

05:22.572 --> 05:24.866
15K is not that bad.
It could have been 20K,

05:24.949 --> 05:28.119
and I didn't rent the reindeer.
Although I really should have.

05:28.202 --> 05:30.872
Wait, is that teen slang for cocaine?
I thought it was "snow."

05:30.955 --> 05:33.666
Look, I can pay you back later
with my influencer money.

05:33.750 --> 05:37.920
Or I can pay you back now
with lipstick and antiaging products.

05:38.004 --> 05:41.341
Cancel your summer plans.
You're getting a job.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.135
Or I get 50K more followers,
and then I monetize my brand,

05:44.218 --> 05:46.679
which'll happen in a week,
'cause I'm very alive and blowing up,

05:46.763 --> 05:48.097
which means I can make it up.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.892
I'm so upset.
I couldn't return my prom dress.

05:50.975 --> 05:52.977
Shit. You actually paid for yours?

05:53.061 --> 05:54.729
Such a bummer not to get swag.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.065
Footage from Chase.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.650
He's making the senior time capsule,
letting me review my footage.

06:01.486 --> 06:04.947
All your angles are perfect, Riley.
You are one equilateral bitch.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.825
-Ooh. Can we approve ours too?
-No, just me.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.411
And maybe Erika. God, I love that bitch.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.538
-So much.
-Yeah, me too. Mm.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.832
-I really wanna stand by my girl.
-Mm-hm.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.460
But I just got my dress… for free.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.379
-Mm.
-I finally decided on a color.

06:19.462 --> 06:22.507
And now no one's gonna know
what it was or how good it looked on me.

06:22.590 --> 06:25.635
What a shame.
I kind of wish we were going.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.764
Yeah, it's so sad that we have to suffer
the consequences of her actions.

06:29.847 --> 06:30.681
Yeah.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.017
It's really too bad there's nothing
we can do about it.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.310
Why can't we?

06:34.394 --> 06:36.521
-Because she's our friend.
-This isn't personal.

06:36.604 --> 06:39.732
We wanna go to prom,
and I know how to make that happen.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.861
I guess. As long as it isn't personal.

06:43.945 --> 06:47.031
-Nothing's personal on the Internet.
-What do you mean?

06:47.115 --> 06:49.492
#UncancelCancelProm.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.179
No service?

07:14.559 --> 07:17.770
-Wi-Fi's out. And my cell service. Fix it.
-Hm. Let me take a look.

07:19.522 --> 07:23.234
So we canceled your cell phone service,
and you're kicked off the Wi-Fi.

07:23.317 --> 07:25.361
-What? No, you can't do that!
-Totally can though.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.697
Get your own phone, Miss Influencer.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.198
I was taking a test!

07:29.282 --> 07:30.992
Then use the computer you made us buy.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.035
An influencer's lifeblood
is her cell phone.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.829
You have 15 minutes to get it back up or--

07:34.912 --> 07:35.997
Or what?

07:47.758 --> 07:49.135
Shit.

07:49.218 --> 07:52.096
Why did I change my password
to something I'd never remember?

07:52.180 --> 07:55.099
No, I am the administrator,
you dumb piece of alloy!

07:59.103 --> 08:00.980
-What is that?
-The house phone.

08:01.063 --> 08:02.148
The only phone I get to use,

08:02.231 --> 08:04.358
'cause those dipshits downstairs
won't let me get a cell

08:04.442 --> 08:05.902
for another two years.

08:05.985 --> 08:06.944
It's for you.

08:07.612 --> 08:08.905
It's some bitch.

08:11.115 --> 08:13.534
Chase let me review
the footage for the time capsule,

08:13.618 --> 08:16.454
and there's a video of you
from the party at Jake W's.

08:16.537 --> 08:17.497
-So?
<i>-So.</i>

08:18.247 --> 08:20.291
You threw mad shade
on all of your friends.

08:20.374 --> 08:21.375
No, I didn't.

08:21.459 --> 08:22.335
<i>Yes, you did.</i>

08:22.418 --> 08:24.420
On Lea, Jake C, me.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.963
<i>So? Everyone talks shit.</i>

08:26.047 --> 08:29.300
It's gonna be buried with a cropped ski
jacket and a Harry Styles coloring book.

08:29.383 --> 08:30.259
<i>Yeah, later.</i>

08:30.343 --> 08:33.596
But first it's going in the senior
text chain for everyone to see.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.097
Fine. Send it to me.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.977
Actually, can… can you send it
to my brother?

08:42.271 --> 08:45.358
<i>Yeah, lame. I said it. Especially Riley.</i>

08:45.441 --> 08:48.653
<i>She's a fake salty giraffe who eats all</i>
<i>the good leaves from the top of the tree.</i>

08:48.736 --> 08:51.155
<i>And Jake C is her little simp bitch</i>

08:51.239 --> 08:54.992
<i>who just stays in a shitty relationship</i>
<i>because he's too afraid to be alone.</i>

08:55.076 --> 08:57.620
<i>And look at Keisha.</i>
<i>She pretends to be a skater,</i>

08:57.703 --> 09:00.164
<i>but those wheels</i>
<i>have never touched pavement.</i>

09:00.248 --> 09:02.625
<i>And Lea. She hates Riley,</i>
<i>but she kisses her ass</i>

09:02.708 --> 09:05.753
<i>because she doesn't want to go back</i>
<i>to slumming it with the band freaks.</i>

09:05.836 --> 09:06.712
-Shit.
-Wow.

09:06.796 --> 09:09.131
I take back
everything I've said about you.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.342
You're a dick,
and I'm honored to call you family.

09:11.425 --> 09:14.720
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

09:14.804 --> 09:16.889
Oh, wait. I just remembered.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.849
I took it all back. I took it all back.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.269
I'm fine. I'm totally fine.

09:24.855 --> 09:26.524
That's it?

09:26.607 --> 09:30.111
Oh no. Oh no, no, no. That's not it.
There's more. Where is the more?

09:31.195 --> 09:32.697
This can't get out. Hand me your phone.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.657
-I don't have a phone.
-The house's phone!

09:35.408 --> 09:37.535
No. This is history as it was.

09:37.618 --> 09:40.830
And as a documentarian with integrity,
I will not cut it out.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.874
-But I took it all back.
<i>-Aw. That's what they all say.</i>

09:43.958 --> 09:46.294
Where's the rest of the footage?
At least put that back in.

09:46.377 --> 09:47.920
I don't know what you're talking about.

09:48.004 --> 09:51.424
What do you want?
Do you like Nikes or Adidas or Allbirds?

09:51.507 --> 09:53.426
Or are you more a luxury jogger type guy?

09:53.509 --> 09:55.136
<i>Oh, Erika, I can't be bribed.</i>

09:55.219 --> 09:57.430
Unlike you, I have principles.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.182
Unless you have an Oculus Quest.

10:00.266 --> 10:03.227
-Uh, I'll find one.
-Have a little self-respect, Erika.

10:04.979 --> 10:07.982
-Gia. I need Gia. Give me your computer.

10:08.065 --> 10:10.318
-I have to text Gia.
-No, I'll do it.

10:15.072 --> 10:17.325
Hey! Hey, I'm glad you texted me.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.201
I… I've wanted to talk too.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.330
-I really wanna reconcile.
-So do I.

10:22.413 --> 10:25.166
-I'm so glad.
-I've been worried about you.

10:25.249 --> 10:26.250
Are you okay?

10:29.420 --> 10:30.296
Uh…

10:31.005 --> 10:31.839
No.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.759
I really don't wanna ascend

10:34.842 --> 10:36.469
while we're in a bad place.

10:37.970 --> 10:38.971
I don't want that either.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.140
I'm starting to glitch.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.018
Like, really, really glitch.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.145
I'm-- I'm fading away, Erika.

10:46.228 --> 10:48.773
I'm losing my power. I don't know
when I'm gonna be gone for good.

10:48.856 --> 10:51.442
Oh my God. You're fading away. Gia, I…

10:52.276 --> 10:53.819
I don't know what to say.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.740
Hey, before you lose your power,
could you just help me with one thing?

10:57.823 --> 11:00.159
Could you use your ghost power
to thwart a video release?

11:00.242 --> 11:03.079
Chase has a bad tape on me,
and I just want it erased.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.246
Could you just scramble it?

11:06.457 --> 11:07.917
Are… Are you kidding me?

11:08.918 --> 11:10.836
I came here to apologize to you.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.714
And you came here to use me?

11:13.798 --> 11:15.424
I am literally about to disappear

11:15.508 --> 11:18.302
into a freaking lava lamp
because I don't know what my UFB is,

11:18.386 --> 11:21.305
and you're sitting here caring
about what everyone thinks about you?

11:21.389 --> 11:23.140
I have done everything…

11:23.224 --> 11:25.685
I have done everything
to make sure that you could be cool

11:25.768 --> 11:28.354
and that you could make your mark
and get a boyfriend,

11:28.437 --> 11:30.314
but you've literally…
you have done nothing…

11:30.398 --> 11:31.774
You have done nothing for me!

11:31.857 --> 11:33.776
You care more about… about this video

11:33.859 --> 11:37.196
or some dumb comment that I wrote
than you care about your best friend!

11:37.279 --> 11:40.491
Maybe… Maybe this video…
It's like you need it to come out!

11:40.574 --> 11:42.827
What? You wrote that comment?

11:42.910 --> 11:44.203
You were my troll?

11:45.204 --> 11:46.997
You are not my friend.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.166
And you… You are not… You are not mine.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.336
I just cannot believe
that I am going to die

11:52.420 --> 11:54.046
the way that I lived!

11:55.214 --> 11:58.050
Which is wasting my time on you.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.316
Jake. Jake!

12:16.026 --> 12:18.988
Hey! Sorry I woke you up.
I just came to apologize.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.823
-For canceling prom?
-No.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.783
-For bringing Riley on our date?
-No.

12:22.867 --> 12:25.828
-For calling me a whiny little bitch?
-Uh, close.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.580
Uh, but not exactly.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.874
Turns out I…
…kinda sorta called you a…

12:29.957 --> 12:31.417
…simp bitch.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.002
So far not a great apology.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.464
Okay,
so there's footage going around

12:36.547 --> 12:39.341
of a party at Jake W's where I kinda
talked mad shit about everyone.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.594
But, I took it back.
Please don't be mad at me.

12:41.677 --> 12:44.388
Um, and I didn't even know you back then
when I said that you

12:44.972 --> 12:49.435
stayed in a shitty relationship with Riley
because you're too afraid of being alone.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.730
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

12:53.230 --> 12:54.148
Yes.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.484
-Uh…
-No.

12:56.567 --> 12:59.528
I… I… I don't know.
What would make you feel better?

12:59.612 --> 13:01.489
-Going back to sleep.
-Okay. Go back to sleep.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.699
-Okay.
-Wait. Uh, please don't be mad at me.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.242
I… I swear I didn't mean any of it.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.244
I'm not mad at you.

13:07.870 --> 13:10.289
-Really?
-Really. Good night, Erika.

13:10.372 --> 13:11.373
Good night.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.839
-I've always dreamed about going to prom.
-Yeah, me too.

13:18.923 --> 13:22.009
It was second on my bucket list
right after "conduct a successful séance."

13:22.092 --> 13:24.178
Well, I know that one's
gonna happen for you.

13:24.261 --> 13:26.222
-You do?
-Yeah, I do.

13:28.682 --> 13:33.187
I… I don't think I've ever liked anyone
as much as I like you, Gia.

13:37.274 --> 13:39.652
-You… You don't like me?
-No.

13:40.611 --> 13:41.654
No, I do.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.365
I do. I like you so much.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.867
Then, what's the problem?

13:49.954 --> 13:52.456
Remember that big lie
that I told to Erika?

13:54.333 --> 13:56.710
Well, it kind of applies to you too.

13:59.421 --> 14:00.965
Uh, that… that's okay.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.927
Just tell me about it now.
That's how relationships get better.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.931
Gavin, you might be…

14:09.682 --> 14:12.393
…the only person
who has ever truly seen me.

14:13.143 --> 14:16.939
And I'm just afraid that at some point
you'll see right through me.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.358
The disappointment.

14:20.609 --> 14:22.236
And I really don't wanna hurt you.

14:25.447 --> 14:26.824
Which is why it's over.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.284
What?

14:28.826 --> 14:30.202
N… No. No. Why?

14:30.953 --> 14:31.954
It just is.

14:32.997 --> 14:33.914
Okay.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.733
-Where's my latte?
-I don't give lattes to bitches.

15:00.816 --> 15:03.235
Fine. Yeah, I do.
But only to bitches that are my friends.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.362
Okay. I get it. You saw the video.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.448
And I'm sorry that I said
that you kiss Riley's ass,

15:07.531 --> 15:10.910
but I meant it as a compliment,
'cause you're, like, so good at it.

15:10.993 --> 15:11.911
What video?

15:13.787 --> 15:15.539
Then why are you mad at me?

15:20.502 --> 15:22.212
The video? Totally scrambled.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.882
What kind of Edward Snowden shit
did you pull?

15:24.965 --> 15:28.469
-So no one's seen the video?
-Ugh, your innocent act is so cringe.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.346
Oh my God! Gia did it.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.472
Did what?

15:31.555 --> 15:34.725
What? So, hold on. If no one's seen
the video, why's everyone mad at me?

15:34.808 --> 15:37.895
I don't know. Maybe it's 'cause
you're a selfish, manipulative bitch.

15:39.605 --> 15:40.731
Ugh.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.203
Hmph.

16:02.503 --> 16:03.712
Sorry. There's no room.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.839
-What's going on?
-You're trending.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.341
-I am?
-Not in a good way.

16:07.424 --> 16:10.511
#UncancelCancelProm is viral
in the US and one province in Canada.

16:10.594 --> 16:12.680
I tried to warn you this was a bad idea.

16:12.763 --> 16:13.931
-No, you didn't.
-Didn't I?

16:14.014 --> 16:15.557
You did.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.768
You took something away from people

16:17.851 --> 16:21.313
that they've been looking forward to
for four years. A rite of passage.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.273
-What did you expect?
-You supported me.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.734
If you're this defensive
I can't have a conversation with you.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.653
-Seriously?
-Seriously.

16:27.736 --> 16:29.321
And you can't sit with us.

16:35.619 --> 16:38.163
Oh, Jake.
People are being so lame.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.666
Everyone's mad at me about prom,
but they wanted this.

16:40.749 --> 16:44.044
If they didn't want prom to be canceled,
then they shouldn't have chanted.

16:44.128 --> 16:47.297
It's on them.
At least you're not mad at me.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.428
You know that I was up all night?
I was thinking about what you said.

16:52.511 --> 16:53.971
You know, what everyone says.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.140
And I realized

16:57.224 --> 16:59.101
that I'm addicted to drama.

17:01.228 --> 17:04.773
-And see, you… you are the queen of it.
-I wouldn't say I'm the queen.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.483
Mm, no. See, I know who I fell for.

17:07.568 --> 17:09.820
And that person is not sitting
next to me right now.

17:09.903 --> 17:12.322
I am. I… I'm just me.

17:13.198 --> 17:16.201
Look. I've had some crazy shit
happen to me

17:16.285 --> 17:19.163
in the past three weeks,
but it's over now. Okay?

17:19.246 --> 17:21.123
I'm gonna be so DGAF.
I'm gonna be so chill.

17:21.206 --> 17:22.666
-Like shaved ice but a person--
-Mm.

17:22.750 --> 17:23.751
That's the thing.

17:23.834 --> 17:27.629
You know, at first, I thought
that I liked that you were DGAF,

17:27.713 --> 17:29.882
and I thought that
maybe I wanted to be more like you.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.759
But then I realized that I…

17:32.634 --> 17:35.095
I'm a GAF. And that's okay.

17:35.179 --> 17:38.140
Because it's… it's not
a bad thing… …to care.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.851
But you make it out
as if it is a bad thing.

17:41.810 --> 17:44.229
And I don't wanna be afraid
to be vulnerable.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.065
I want you to be vulnerable with me.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.399
No, you don't.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.651
You know how you said
that I stay in shitty relationships

17:49.735 --> 17:52.362
because I'm too afraid
to be alone?

17:53.363 --> 17:54.364
Well, you're right.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.283
I'm afraid.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.120
But I'm gonna do it anyway.

18:03.749 --> 18:04.666
We're done, Erika.

18:11.298 --> 18:13.634
Dude, are you burning a corsage?

18:13.717 --> 18:14.718
Mm-hm.

18:15.677 --> 18:18.889
-Who did this to you, man?
-Why? So you can hit on her?

18:19.598 --> 18:21.767
So I can know
who broke my best friend's heart.

18:21.850 --> 18:24.311
I'll hex that bitch. Gimme a strand
of her hair, nail clippings,

18:24.394 --> 18:26.980
and maybe some menstrual blood.
I'll take care of it.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.482
No. No hexing.

18:28.565 --> 18:29.900
Just tell us who it is.

18:29.983 --> 18:33.612
You guys know her. She's one of the girls
always asking about unfinished business.

18:34.571 --> 18:35.405
Her?

18:35.489 --> 18:37.741
No. That is her best friend.

18:38.408 --> 18:39.993
Or was her best friend.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.790
You know? Gia. From the cemetery.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.125
Who's Gia?

18:46.834 --> 18:48.418
Only Erika was at the cemetery.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.770
Are you freaking kidding me?

19:08.564 --> 19:10.899
So, when we found out
your daughter didn't have a license,

19:10.983 --> 19:12.776
we had to impound the car for 30 days.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.695
Where is your driver's license?

19:15.946 --> 19:17.614
Goodbye, license with the hideous pic!

19:17.698 --> 19:20.909
You can get the car fixed in 30 days,
but, uh, it's not gonna be cheap.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.744
She really banged it up.

19:22.828 --> 19:23.662
Add it to my bill.

19:27.833 --> 19:31.003
Ah! Oh my God! My phone. It's on.

19:31.086 --> 19:33.881
Yeah. I convinced them
to turn it back on, assface.

19:33.964 --> 19:37.676
I told them you've agreed to drive me
to baseball and need it for emergencies.

19:37.759 --> 19:38.844
You're welcome.
