A1, do you-- do you really
think I would do that?

00:08.708 --> 00:10.777
{\an8}Did you do that,
is what I'm asking.

00:14.647 --> 00:15.815
{\an8}I'm mad at Ray.

00:15.882 --> 00:17.784
{\an7}Ain't nothing wrong with
a brotherly fav, fam.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.686
{\an8}Hold up, though.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.686
{\an7}(bleep).

00:19.753 --> 00:20.787
{\an8}Easy, easy.

00:19.753 --> 00:20.787
{\an8}(bleep), what's up?

00:20.854 --> 00:22.455
{\an8}How you talking?

00:20.854 --> 00:22.455
{\an8}Look, look, look.

Shun Love, she wants me
to sign a contract

00:26.292 --> 00:27.994
{\an8}and she wanna manage me.

00:28.061 --> 00:29.129
{\an7}You don't need to know
nothing 'bout her contract.

00:29.195 --> 00:30.196
{\an8}You ain't got no money.

00:30.263 --> 00:32.799
{\an8}How do you know
I'm the father?

00:32.866 --> 00:36.803
{\an7}He says to me you might not
even be his child.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.972
{\an8}I really know why you
really don't want me here.

00:39.038 --> 00:42.142
{\an7}Why?

00:39.038 --> 00:42.142
{\an8}Because you know I know
the truth about Lyrica.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.543
{\an8}This bitch is booked
and paid,

00:43.610 --> 00:45.779
{\an8}while you're not booked
and (bleep) bored.

00:45.845 --> 00:48.047
{\an8}Please heal all loose boxes
starting with La'Britney's,

00:48.114 --> 00:49.215
{\an8}the loosest of 'em all!

{\an8}Been hanging out

00:53.787 --> 00:55.955
{\an8}but now she about
to get married.

00:56.022 --> 00:58.358
{\an8}Marcus, he popped
the question.

00:58.425 --> 01:00.860
{\an7}Everything I hear
about him is negative.

01:00.927 --> 01:04.464
{\an8}Hey, girl, did you come here
for your chocolate surprise?

01:04.531 --> 01:05.698
{\an8}I was invited by Marcus.

01:05.765 --> 01:08.401
{\an9}Marcus!

01:05.765 --> 01:08.401
{\an7}Yeah.

01:08.468 --> 01:10.537
{\an9}I'm Marcus.

01:10.603 --> 01:12.739
{\an8}Ohh!

01:10.603 --> 01:12.739
{\an8}Oh, wait a minute!

01:12.806 --> 01:14.908
{\an7}(Bridget)
Bitch, I ain't got
nothing to do with you!

01:16.209 --> 01:17.277
{\an8}And she look mad.

01:17.343 --> 01:19.546
{\an8}I need you to catch
a pin on him, right?

01:19.612 --> 01:20.947
{\an7}I want you to find out
his location.

01:21.014 --> 01:23.316
{\an8}So, I gotta drop a pin?

01:23.383 --> 01:26.453
{\an7}Moniece is going around
saying that Brandi

01:26.519 --> 01:28.588
{\an8}is my surrogate.

01:26.519 --> 01:28.588
{\an9}What?!

01:28.655 --> 01:31.724
{\an8}Come see me when you
drop that demon seed.

01:31.791 --> 01:33.259
{\an7}We can revisit
this conversation

01:33.326 --> 01:35.995

when I have my baby.

Look, I was trying
to look out,

03:11.491 --> 03:13.026
the timing was very bad.

03:13.092 --> 03:16.596
And for that,
I apologize, you know?

03:16.663 --> 03:18.364
And I felt bad
about that.

03:18.431 --> 03:19.832
{\an5}And then you trying
to catch a fade...

03:18.431 --> 03:19.832
I do.
I'm taking my hat

03:23.469 --> 03:26.773
{\an1}You wasn't wrong for trying
to take a fade with me.

03:26.839 --> 03:28.308
{\an1}And I'm not tripping off that,
like, we can fight,

03:28.374 --> 03:29.642
{\an5}we family, bro, like but...

03:28.374 --> 03:29.642
No, I know, and I--

03:29.709 --> 03:32.011
but you know, as a friend,

you supposed to be there

Even though I don't feel
like I'm the one to blame

03:50.363 --> 03:52.765
in this situation,
I made some mistakes,

03:52.832 --> 03:53.866
and I apologized.

03:53.933 --> 03:55.902
{\an1}Safaree hit me up
on Instagram.

03:55.969 --> 03:57.036
He in town.

one last shot, fam.

Don't be in here
rolling your eyes

04:06.045 --> 04:07.747
and (bleep)
in front of people.

04:07.814 --> 04:09.716
{\an8}I don't have no problem.

04:07.814 --> 04:09.716
{\an8}Are you sure?

04:09.782 --> 04:11.351
'Cause you clearly
got an attitude.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.720
{\an5}Mm-hmm.

{\an1}Hey, guys.

04:15.121 --> 04:16.522
{\an1}I'm good.

{\an3}Hi.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.690
How are you guys?

04:17.757 --> 04:19.325
{\an5}I'm good.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.325
Don't let Brooke

04:19.392 --> 04:21.361
{\an1}ever play Never Have I Ever
with you, before I sit.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.296
Oh my God, okay.

04:23.363 --> 04:25.264
{\an8}See, I was hoping
we wouldn't do that today.

04:25.331 --> 04:27.400
{\an1}Brooke, if you want me
to forgive you,

04:27.467 --> 04:28.801
{\an1}I forgive you.
(laughs)

04:28.868 --> 04:31.237
Well, I mean...

04:31.304 --> 04:34.073
(clicking tongue)
I forgive you too?

04:34.140 --> 04:35.208
{\an7}I'm not gonna sit here
and front

04:35.274 --> 04:36.509
{\an7}like I didn't say
something rude to you.

04:36.576 --> 04:37.610
{\an8}So, I apologize too.

04:37.677 --> 04:38.711
{\an6}See?

04:37.677 --> 04:38.711
Ain't that some (bleep)?

04:38.778 --> 04:40.647
That's real
recognizing real.

04:40.713 --> 04:42.215
{\an1}(laughing)

04:40.713 --> 04:42.215
{\an3}That's it.

04:42.281 --> 04:44.050
{\an5}Okay, that's good.

04:42.281 --> 04:44.050
What? Why?
What's wrong with you?

04:44.117 --> 04:45.785
{\an5}That was good.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.785
Yo, he over here
with an attitude, girl.

04:45.852 --> 04:47.320
{\an5}Let me tell you about it.

04:45.852 --> 04:47.320
Why you got an attitude?

04:47.387 --> 04:48.888
Let me tell you
about him, okay?

04:48.955 --> 04:50.123
There's trouble in paradise.

04:50.189 --> 04:52.058
Let's talk about
Amber Cubic Zirconia.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.526
So, she apparently
has a story

04:53.593 --> 04:55.194
about her
and Marcus, child,

04:55.261 --> 04:58.131
texting and whatever
they've been doing.

04:58.197 --> 05:01.401
{\an1}So me, I started texting her
like I was Marcus.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.869
{\an1}And I was like, "Ooh, baby,
come to my event."

05:02.935 --> 05:05.304
{\an5}This is goofy.

05:02.935 --> 05:05.304
She show--
she show up, right?

05:05.371 --> 05:06.873
{\an5}With her whole mama.

05:05.371 --> 05:06.873
Brooke.

05:06.939 --> 05:09.108
Listen, her mama
snatched her wig off

05:09.175 --> 05:10.443
and tried to hit
Bridget with it,

05:10.510 --> 05:11.878
and I had to turn up
on that bitch.

05:11.944 --> 05:13.780
You gonna bring,
like, our issues

05:13.846 --> 05:15.148
that we're dealing with
at the crib.

05:15.214 --> 05:16.349
Like, this ain't got
nothing to do with Nikki,

05:16.416 --> 05:17.550
{\an5}like, she ain't gotta--

05:16.416 --> 05:17.550
I didn't mention

05:17.617 --> 05:19.686
that you put me on
(bleep) probation.

05:19.752 --> 05:21.354
{\an5}That was it right there.

05:19.752 --> 05:21.354
What? What happened?

05:21.421 --> 05:22.422
Oh, nothing.
I think you guys should talk.

05:22.488 --> 05:23.856
I'm gonna go catch up with A1.

05:23.923 --> 05:25.792
Things have been a little tense
between Brooke and I.

05:25.858 --> 05:28.261
Perhaps I shouldn't have been
liking Amber's pictures.

05:28.327 --> 05:30.129
But you know,
what's the big deal

05:30.196 --> 05:31.364
with liking pictures, anyway?

05:31.431 --> 05:32.865
I kinda feel like
it's the same thing

05:32.932 --> 05:34.734
that she did with Stasi
and with Jade,

05:34.801 --> 05:37.437
you know, just overreacting
without actual information.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.505
You know, like,
I love him to death,

05:39.572 --> 05:41.441
{\an5}but it's like all
of these issues, boo.

05:39.572 --> 05:41.441
Yeah, I like y'all together.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.343
You know what I'm saying?
Chill out!

05:44.410 --> 05:45.945
{\an3}Hi!

05:44.410 --> 05:45.945
Hi, ladies.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.014
{\an5}We got company, Nikki.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.014
{\an1}Hi, Nikki.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.816
Princess, congrats again.

05:49.882 --> 05:50.883
{\an4}Thank you.

05:49.882 --> 05:50.883
Oh, my gosh.

05:50.950 --> 05:53.619
Nice to see you.
Mwah.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.621
Hi, Lyrica, it's nice
to see you too.

05:55.688 --> 05:56.789
{\an8}Hi, you too.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.157
{\an8}I heard
you're having a boy.

05:58.224 --> 05:59.692
I know I wasn't invited
to the gender reveal.

05:59.759 --> 06:01.894
{\an1}No.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.798
So, Princess,
what's up with you?

06:05.865 --> 06:08.668
Like, I mean, I seen
Moniece on the Internet

06:08.735 --> 06:10.503
talking her bull(bleep).

06:10.570 --> 06:13.272
Like, it all started
because she threw

06:13.339 --> 06:14.707
a drink at me.

06:14.774 --> 06:16.843
Yeah, I talked
about her motherhood,

06:16.909 --> 06:18.711
{\an1}because that's the only thing
I know about you.

06:18.778 --> 06:20.747
Ever since then,
she's been attacking me,

06:20.813 --> 06:22.248
attacking my marriage.

06:22.315 --> 06:23.549
Either let's square up,
or shut up.

06:23.616 --> 06:25.084
{\an1}Sometimes you just
have to ignore people

06:25.151 --> 06:27.253
{\an1}and let them be stupid
by themselves.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.654
{\an5}You know, I thought that too.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.654
Let them talk
to themselves.

06:28.721 --> 06:32.892
{\an1}But I think that...
I need to make an exception.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.627
What you think, Nikki?

06:34.694 --> 06:35.728
Well, girl,
you know my nose is fixed.

06:35.795 --> 06:36.996
I don't do so much fighting.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.397
(laughter)

06:38.464 --> 06:41.534
Moniece has been a pain
in my ass for far too long.

06:41.601 --> 06:43.903
And now that I've had my baby,
there's no reason

06:43.970 --> 06:46.172
why we shouldn't meet up
and take care of this.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.274
The last time I saw
you guys together

06:48.341 --> 06:49.709
was at my gender reveal.

06:49.776 --> 06:50.943
Y'all were flipping
over tables, so...

06:51.010 --> 06:52.845
{\an5}I need to take
a sip of this.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.845
{\an1}Yeah.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.347
{\an5}We're good today, right?

06:52.912 --> 06:54.347
Terribly sorry for that.

06:54.413 --> 06:56.315
This just kind of--
it's wack.

06:56.382 --> 06:58.251
I think I know how
this conversation should go.

06:58.317 --> 07:03.890
"Lyrica, I apologize for..."

07:03.956 --> 07:05.091
Oh, like I should
apologize to Lyrica?

07:05.158 --> 07:07.927
Yeah.
She didn't tell your boyfriend

07:07.994 --> 07:09.829
that you were sleeping
with somebody else.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.464
I never said
anything about sex.

07:11.531 --> 07:12.765
{\an5}You told me though, but--

07:11.531 --> 07:12.765
I don't know
if she had sex

07:12.832 --> 07:13.833
{\an5}with Safaree.

07:12.832 --> 07:13.833
You told me too.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.268
Huh?
I told you what?

07:15.334 --> 07:17.470
{\an8}That you thought she was
messing with Safaree.

07:17.537 --> 07:19.272
{\an8}That they were texting
each other and whatever.

07:19.338 --> 07:20.406
{\an5}I did say that.

07:19.338 --> 07:20.406
And that she said

07:20.473 --> 07:21.407
his (bleep) was wrapped
around his leg.

07:21.474 --> 07:23.009
I did say that.

07:23.075 --> 07:25.378
Then, I think that
she deserves an apology.

07:25.444 --> 07:26.746
{\an3}Yeah.

07:25.444 --> 07:26.746
{\an1}My BFF!

07:26.813 --> 07:28.481
{\an5}Come on, girl,
give me some.

07:26.813 --> 07:28.481
Yeah, I said that.

07:28.548 --> 07:30.783
I've apologized
to Lyrica already.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.251
I'm not gonna keep
apologizing,

07:32.318 --> 07:33.519
I'm not a little kid.

07:33.586 --> 07:35.388
(Brooke)
Oh, honey, I definitely believe

07:35.454 --> 07:37.590
that Lyrica put Princess
up to everything

07:37.657 --> 07:39.091
that she's talking about.

07:39.158 --> 07:40.393
So, now that we're in public,
she want me

07:40.459 --> 07:42.562
to get on my knees
and kiss her ass.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.097
That's <i> never</i> gonna happen.

07:45.164 --> 07:47.400
So, do you accept
her apology, Lyrica?

07:47.466 --> 07:48.768
(Lyrica)
It's pretty sad.

07:48.835 --> 07:49.936
I mean, Brooke and I,

07:50.002 --> 07:52.305
we used to be really
good friends.

07:52.371 --> 07:54.307
In my book,
if you're a true friend,

07:54.373 --> 07:56.509
there's nothing wrong with
saying "I'm sorry" again,

07:56.576 --> 07:58.845
when she is <i> clearly</i>
in the wrong.

07:58.911 --> 08:00.646
I guess we don't
need to be friends.

08:00.713 --> 08:01.881
Fine by me.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.516
{\an1}I accept to leave
the table.

08:06.219 --> 08:07.220
But have a lovely day.

08:07.286 --> 08:08.955
{\an5}Amen, sister.

08:07.286 --> 08:08.955
Good night, y'all.

08:09.021 --> 08:11.224
{\an5}Bye, Lyrica.

08:09.021 --> 08:11.224
I wish you the best.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.693
No, that's not how
that's gonna go.

{\an8}he's not my father

{\an8}But it's something fishy

08:34.145 --> 08:35.581

After that bomb
that Patrice dropped on me

09:24.697 --> 09:26.899
of the texts
that A1 sent to her,

09:26.966 --> 09:28.434
I decided that I had to get
to the bottom

09:28.501 --> 09:30.269
of all this (bleep).

09:30.336 --> 09:32.605
What up, Ma?

09:30.336 --> 09:32.605
{\an1}Hey, son.

09:32.672 --> 09:34.907
I need to talk
some sense into A1

09:34.974 --> 09:37.877
'cause I wanna see how come
he still wanna be married

09:37.944 --> 09:39.679
to Lyrica after all that?

09:39.745 --> 09:42.148
{\an1}I brung you here
so we can have a talk.

09:42.214 --> 09:44.417
{\an8}The other day,
me and Lyrica G

09:44.483 --> 09:46.085
{\an8}went dress shopping.

09:46.152 --> 09:49.422
{\an1}I invited Patrice,
and she told Patrice

09:49.488 --> 09:51.657
{\an1}that she didn't want her
to be at the wedding,

09:51.724 --> 09:52.925
her or Loyd.

09:52.992 --> 09:56.862
{\an1}And something just not
registering at all.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.865
{\an1}Because Patrice told me
that Lyrica

09:59.932 --> 10:01.934
was texting some other man.

10:02.001 --> 10:04.503
{\an5}(laughing)
Man, yo.

10:02.001 --> 10:04.503
{\an1}Okay?

10:04.570 --> 10:07.640
{\an1}You sent these text messages
to Patrice.

10:07.707 --> 10:10.376
{\an1}And what has me
so concerned about the text

10:10.443 --> 10:13.145
{\an1}is that you knew that she
was messing around,

10:13.212 --> 10:14.914
and you condoned that (bleep).

10:14.981 --> 10:16.782
Probably was some
long-time-ago (bleep),

10:16.849 --> 10:20.319
but I never was like,
oh, she's cheating on me.

10:20.386 --> 10:23.189
{\an1}But I was just putting that
out there to Patrice

10:23.255 --> 10:24.757
so she could be on my side.

10:24.824 --> 10:27.560
But she's so messy
that she would keep

10:27.626 --> 10:28.861
(bleep) like that.

10:28.928 --> 10:30.496
{\an1}What about your vows?
Is you gonna go through it?

10:30.563 --> 10:31.998
Of course, yeah.

10:32.064 --> 10:35.468
{\an1}We're on some real (bleep),
like, Patrice can't come.

10:35.534 --> 10:36.902
I know that's
my brother's wife,

10:36.969 --> 10:39.372
but I can't (bleep)
with her right now.

10:39.438 --> 10:42.108
{\an5}(A1)
I know my mom has
my best interests at heart,

10:42.174 --> 10:45.544
but it's hard to tell when
she's asking for DNA tests

10:45.611 --> 10:48.080
and still getting into fights
with Lyrica G.

10:48.147 --> 10:51.217
I don't want no negativity
at my vow renewal,

10:51.283 --> 10:53.285
and that includes family.

10:53.352 --> 10:55.588
{\an1}Your brother at least
could be there.

10:55.654 --> 10:56.956
Might not go
if she can't go,

10:57.023 --> 10:58.691
so then, hey.

10:58.758 --> 11:00.059
I understand you have a wife,

11:00.126 --> 11:02.294
but your family
come first too.

11:02.361 --> 11:05.998
{\an5}There's a time--

11:02.361 --> 11:05.998
Honestly, nobody comes
before my wife.

11:06.065 --> 11:08.801
These are the reasons
why I'm keeping people

11:08.868 --> 11:09.969
out of my business.

11:10.036 --> 11:12.104
I wanna be (bleep) happy.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.339
Don't let her run you.

you wear the pants.

11:15.441 --> 11:16.776
You're being disrespectful.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.878
{\an1}No, I'm not.
Something ain't right.

11:18.944 --> 11:21.147
{\an4}I don't think you
happy about it.

11:18.944 --> 11:21.147
I just told you
what ain't right.

11:21.213 --> 11:22.214
{\an6}I'm happy.

11:21.213 --> 11:22.214
You're not happy.

11:22.281 --> 11:23.682
I'm happy in life.

15:41.740 --> 15:44.543
So, you tell me,
what's the real?

15:44.610 --> 15:47.713
{\an8}Well, I'ma tell you
straight up, like...

15:47.780 --> 15:51.583
I never, ever had sex
with Lyrica.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.786
Nothing happened.

15:53.852 --> 15:56.155
{\an1}You saying that, then what
is Ray J talking 'bout?

Look, the conversation
that I had with Ray,

15:59.024 --> 16:02.928
{\an1}like, I don't know if things
just got "misconscrewed" or...

16:02.995 --> 16:05.431
Brooke running around saying,

16:05.497 --> 16:07.433
{\an1}"They was flirty texting
and (bleep)."

16:07.499 --> 16:10.102
We would just be talking
about music,

16:10.169 --> 16:12.771

she would start to pro--

16:12.838 --> 16:14.039

into the world

you in the studio 24/7,

16:17.443 --> 16:20.612

as much of your attention

16:20.679 --> 16:22.348
as she would like,
you know what I'm saying?

16:22.414 --> 16:24.249
{\an1}I ain't mean nothing by it,
you know?

16:24.316 --> 16:28.120
I wasn't trying
to step in on your wife,

16:28.187 --> 16:32.124

thing from my mind.

16:32.191 --> 16:33.625

with this picture

16:33.692 --> 16:38.230

25:45.010 --> 25:46.511

25:46.578 --> 25:48.980
I knew that you needed
a father in your life,

25:49.047 --> 25:51.049
and I tried to build
a relationship with you,

25:51.116 --> 25:54.252
and you pushed me away.

25:54.319 --> 25:56.588
{\an1}You're a stranger
acting like my father.

25:56.655 --> 25:58.023

25:56.655 --> 25:58.023
That's weird.

telling me this

25:59.724 --> 26:01.259

to go through all this,

26:01.326 --> 26:02.694

26:02.761 --> 26:04.462
Even if you find
your real father,

26:04.529 --> 26:07.098
{\an5}you still have to get
to know him again.

26:04.529 --> 26:07.098
{\an1}Yeah.

26:07.165 --> 26:08.433
And you have
to be a daughter.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.635
{\an1}I know how to be
a daughter.

26:10.702 --> 26:12.103

26:12.170 --> 26:13.438
If you knew how
to be a daughter

26:13.505 --> 26:14.773
and you thought
I was your father,

26:14.839 --> 26:17.309
you would've shown me
how to be a daughter.

26:17.375 --> 26:18.476
You could have
practiced with me.

26:18.543 --> 26:20.111
{\an1}You can't even be a daddy,
so knock it off.

26:20.178 --> 26:21.613
{\an6}How?

26:20.178 --> 26:21.613

he wasn't my father

26:28.119 --> 26:29.554
and still took the DNA test,

26:29.621 --> 26:31.923
and still was in my life
for six years

26:31.990 --> 26:33.358
knowing that he wasn't,
