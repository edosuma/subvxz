DON'T TELL HIM.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.957
WE DON'T WANT TO WORRY HIM.

11:48.040 --> 11:48.332
- DON'T BE SILLY.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.042
VICTOR.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.169
- I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.547
- OH, VICTOR,
IT'S ABOUT PATRICIA.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.507
SHE WENT OUT WITH HER AUNT AND
UNCLE AFTER THE SHOW LAST NIGHT,

11:56.590 --> 11:58.259
AND, WELL,
SHE HASN'T RETURNED.

11:58.342 --> 12:00.219
- CALM DOWN.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.471
HER AUNT PHONED ME THIS MORNING.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.722
THE UNCLE WAS TAKEN ILL
DURING THE NIGHT,

12:03.806 --> 12:07.184
AND THEY ARE CURRENTLY
AT THE HOSPITAL WITH HIM.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.312
- OH, WELL, THAT'S A RELIEF.

12:10.396 --> 12:13.149
- OKAY,
NOW WE KNOW SOMETHING'S WRONG.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.233
- WHY?

12:14.316 --> 12:16.110
- BECAUSE THE AUNT AND UNCLE
WHO CALLED VICTOR,

12:16.193 --> 12:18.320
THEY DON'T EXIST.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.864
- OH, YEAH, GOOD POINT.

12:19.947 --> 12:20.781
- WHERE WERE THEY
SUPPOSED TO MEET?

12:20.865 --> 12:22.992
WE NEED TO FIND
THAT GOOD-LUCK CARD.

12:23.075 --> 12:23.909
- I'M HEADING BACK OVER
TO THE SCHOOL

12:23.993 --> 12:26.078
TO DO SOME RESEARCH ON THESE
ANYWAY.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.997
- AND I'M GOING TO GO AND FIND
THAT CARD IN PATRICIA'S ROOM.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.248
- SIBUNA.

12:29.331 --> 12:33.210
[together]
SIBUNA.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.965
- I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING
ABOUT THIS, FABIAN.

12:38.048 --> 12:39.341
- NINA, DON'T WORRY.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.551
PATRICIA IS A TOUGH COOKIE.

12:40.634 --> 12:44.013
SHE CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.681
- HELP!

12:45.764 --> 12:47.391
HELP ME!

12:47.475 --> 12:50.060
HELP!

12:50.144 --> 12:51.270
- YOU CAN SCREAM
AS LOUD AS YOU LIKE, PATRICIA.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.689
NO ONE IS GONNA HEAR YOU.

12:53.772 --> 12:55.858
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.568
- REALLY?

12:57.651 --> 13:00.571
SO HOW COME THE TRIP HERE IN
YOUR VAN ONLY TOOK FIVE MINUTES?

13:00.654 --> 13:02.198
- OH, BRAVO, A NANCY DREW,

13:02.281 --> 13:03.574
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY DIFFERENCE.

13:03.657 --> 13:06.368
- DOESN'T IT?

13:06.452 --> 13:07.703
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

13:07.786 --> 13:09.330
- OH, I'M SURE SOMEONE
WILL HAVE FOUND

13:09.413 --> 13:10.706
MY LITTLE CLUE BY NOW.

13:10.789 --> 13:13.918
MIGHT AS WELL
JUST GIVE YOURSELF UP.

13:14.001 --> 13:16.545
- WHAT LITTLE CLUE?

13:16.629 --> 13:20.591
I SAID,
WHAT LITTLE CLUE?

13:22.259 --> 13:24.512
TELL ME.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.889
- MY RING.

13:26.972 --> 13:27.932
I DROPPED MY RING
IN THE CLEARING

13:28.015 --> 13:32.728
SO SOMEONE WOULD FIND IT
AND KNOW I WAS NEARBY.

13:32.811 --> 13:36.649
- YOU'RE CAUSING ME A GREAT DEAL
OF GRIEF, YOUNG LADY.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.498
- OH, HI, MARA.

13:52.581 --> 13:56.502
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF YOU NEEDED ANY--

13:56.585 --> 13:59.838
ANY HELP WITH THE MICK THING.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.841
YOU KNOW, IF YOU NEED TO TALK,
I'M KIND OF AN EXPERT.

14:04.677 --> 14:09.014
UM,
IS THAT PATRICIA'S COSTUME?

14:09.098 --> 14:10.432
- I'M WRITING HIM A LETTER.

14:10.516 --> 14:11.475
DO YOU THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?

14:11.559 --> 14:13.561
MR. WINKLER'S TOLD ME
TO WASH ALL THE COSTUMES,

14:13.644 --> 14:15.980
SO I'M JUST GONNA TAKE THIS
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU.

14:16.063 --> 14:17.439
- YEAH, SURE.
MINE'S OVER THERE.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.275
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:19.358 --> 14:20.359
- ABOUT WHAT?

14:20.442 --> 14:22.319
- WRITING MICK A LETTER.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.446
- WHATEVER, JANE AUSTEN.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.615
JUST TEXT HIM.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.993
- THANKS FOR THAT, AMBER.

14:29.076 --> 14:31.662
- LOOK WHAT I FOUND IN THE
POCKET OF PATRICIA'S COSTUME.

14:31.745 --> 14:34.623
- YES.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.835
"MEET ME TONIGHT. NINE.
CLEARING IN THE WOODS. JOY."

14:37.918 --> 14:39.295
I THINK I KNOW
WHERE THAT IS.

14:39.378 --> 14:40.296
I'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE
WITH PATRICIA.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.464
- LET'S GO.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.009
- ARE WE GOING TO WAIT
FOR FABIAN.

14:45.092 --> 14:47.970
- YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S LIKE
WHEN HE'S DOING HIS RESEARCH.

14:48.053 --> 14:48.887
- BUT IT'S GETTING DARK OUTSIDE,

14:48.971 --> 14:51.265
AND IT'S GONNA BE SUPPER
IN HALF AN HOUR.

14:51.348 --> 14:52.808
IT LOOKS A BIT COLD OUT THERE,

14:52.891 --> 14:54.310
AND I HAVEN'T PUT
MY HAND LOTION ON.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.645
- AMBER...

14:56.729 --> 14:58.105
- OKAY, I'M SCARED.
I ADMIT IT.

14:58.188 --> 14:59.648
BUT I DON'T LIKE GOING
INTO THE WOODS

14:59.732 --> 15:01.150
AT THE BEST OF TIMES,
AND THIS IS, LIKE,

15:01.233 --> 15:02.484
THE OPPOSITE OF THAT.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.111
- IF WE STICK TOGETHER,
WE'LL BE FINE.

15:04.194 --> 15:05.904
COME ON,
WE OWE THIS TO PATRICIA.

15:14.413 --> 15:17.625
- WAIT.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.543
I'M NOT SAYING I WON'T HELP YOU.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.295
I JUST THINK
WE SHOULD ASK VICTOR

15:21.378 --> 15:23.172
TO BE IN ON THIS DISCUSSION.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.466
- HE'LL NEVER AGREED
TO RUFUS' DEMANDS.

15:25.549 --> 15:27.468
HE'LL SAY WE HAVE TO PROTECT
THE SECRET.

15:27.551 --> 15:28.844
- WELL,
PERHAPS HE'S RIGHT.

15:28.927 --> 15:30.888
- YOU'RE NOT THINKING CLEARLY,
ERIC.

15:30.971 --> 15:32.848
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WILL HAPPEN TO THIS PLACE

15:32.931 --> 15:35.184
IF WORD GETS AROUND
THAT CHILDREN ARE GOING MISSING

15:35.267 --> 15:36.769
UNDER MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES.

15:36.852 --> 15:39.521
THEY'LL CLOSE US DOWN,
THAT'S WHAT.

15:39.605 --> 15:43.275
AND WITHOUT THIS PLACE,
OUR SECRET IS WORTHLESS.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.361
- WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU INTEND
TO DO?

15:45.444 --> 15:48.739
- WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO TO GET
PATRICIA AWAY FROM THAT MAN.

15:56.872 --> 15:57.873
- WHERE IS EVERYONE?

15:57.956 --> 15:59.667
- WHO CARES?
MORE FOOD FOR ME.

15:59.750 --> 16:03.545
UM, WHAT I MEANT TO SAY WAS,

16:03.629 --> 16:06.965
THEY'RE ALL OFF, TRUDY,
DOING THEIR CHORES,

16:07.049 --> 16:08.634
AND QUITE RIGHT TOO.

16:08.717 --> 16:10.260
- WHAT?

16:10.344 --> 16:12.012
OH, NEVER MIND.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.055
WE'D BETTER START.

16:13.138 --> 16:16.225
OTHERWISE,
IT WILL GET COLD.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.726
- OH.

16:17.810 --> 16:18.936
- SO, MRS. LEWIS,

16:19.019 --> 16:20.187
DID YOU ENJOY THE PLAY
LAST NIGHT?

16:20.270 --> 16:21.772
- OH, YES--

16:21.855 --> 16:22.731
- WE'D HAVE ENJOYED IT MORE
IF OUR SON HAD MORE TO DO,

16:22.815 --> 16:23.774
WOULDN'T WE, MARSHA?

16:23.857 --> 16:25.109
- YES.

16:25.192 --> 16:26.568
- DAD, I DON'T WANT
TO EMBARRASS MY FRIENDS

16:26.652 --> 16:27.695
BY TALKING ABOUT THAT.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.613
- NO, I'M SURE YOU DON'T.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.073
- THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH YOU,
ALFRED.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.616
YOU DON'T PUSH YOURSELF FORWARD.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.451
YOU COULD BE SO MUCH MORE
THAN THE BACK END OF A CAMEL,

16:34.535 --> 16:35.536
RIGHT, DEAR?

16:35.619 --> 16:37.996
- YES, PHILLIP.
- ACTUALLY, I WAS THE FRONT END.

16:38.080 --> 16:38.997
- I CAN'T IMAGINE
YOUNG JEROME HERE

16:39.081 --> 16:41.375
RELYING HIMSELF
TO BE OVERSHADOWED.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.252
- HE PLAYED THE CAMEL'S BUTT.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.212
- TELL THEM ABOUT YOUR CHORES.

16:45.295 --> 16:46.922
- WHAT CHORES?

16:47.005 --> 16:48.549
- YOU KNOW, YOUR CHORES.

16:48.632 --> 16:49.675
THE REASON WHY NO ONE'S HERE
AT THIS DINNER TABLE:

16:49.758 --> 16:52.052
AWAY DOING HIS BIDDING.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.595
- YES, THOSE CHORES,
LOTS OF CHORES,

16:53.679 --> 16:56.598
TOO MANY TO MENTION, REALLY.

16:56.682 --> 16:57.933
- JEROME SEEMS TO HAVE
A BETTER HANDLE

16:58.016 --> 17:00.436
ON THE WORKFORCE THAN YOU DO,
ALFRED.

17:00.519 --> 17:04.021
HOW DID MY SON BEAT YOU
TO HEAD OF HOUSE?

17:04.106 --> 17:05.607
- I TURNED IT DOWN.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.984
ALFRED WAS LOOKING FORWARD
TO THE TITLE SO MUCH THAT--

17:15.909 --> 17:18.829
- OW.
- SHH, IT'S RUFUS.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.959
- WHAT'S HE LOOKING FOR?

17:24.041 --> 17:27.880
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I THINK HE FOUND IT.

17:40.893 --> 17:44.646
- UH...

17:44.730 --> 17:45.814
AMBER, LOOK, IT'S OIL.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.650
- OH, NO.
DO I HAVE IT ON MY SHOE?

17:48.734 --> 17:50.277
- RUFUS' VAN IS LEAKING.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.570
- TELL ME ABOUT IT...

17:51.653 --> 17:53.864
ONE PAIR OF
LIMITED-EDITION SHOES LATER.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.157
- IT'S A TRAIL.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.825
RIGHT NOW,
HE'S THE ONLY LEAD WE'VE GOT.

17:56.909 --> 17:57.993
LET'S FOLLOW IT.

17:58.076 --> 17:58.410
MAYBE IT WILL LEAD US
TO PATRICIA.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.953
COME ON.

18:00.037 --> 18:02.623
- AND THAT'S WHY
IF PEOPLE WANT TO KEEP

18:02.706 --> 18:04.166
THEIR EATING PRIVILEGES
IN THIS HOUSE,

18:04.249 --> 18:05.459
THEY HAVE TO DO THEIR CHORES.

18:05.542 --> 18:08.003
NO CHORES: NO CHOW.

18:08.086 --> 18:10.798
- EATING PRIVILEGES...
THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS.

18:10.881 --> 18:11.757
ALFRED.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.760
- IS IT?
WELL IT'S ONLY--

18:14.843 --> 18:16.053
- I MIGHT TRY THAT
IN THE BOARDROOM.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.806
PERHAPS THERE IS HOPE
FOR THE BOY.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.349
HE'S MUCH MORE LIKE ME
THAN WE THOUGHT,

18:20.432 --> 18:21.892
EH, MARSHA, RUTHLESS.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.186
- HOW CAN ALFRED POSSIBLE FAIL
WITH PARENTS LIKE YOU:

18:24.269 --> 18:26.105
UNSTOPPABLE AMBITION
ON ONE SIDE,

18:26.188 --> 18:28.273
POISE AND BEAUTY ON THE OTHER?

18:28.357 --> 18:30.400
- VERY PERCEPTIVE, JEROME.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.569
I CAN SEE YOU'RE
A GOOD INFLUENCE ON OUR BOY.

18:32.653 --> 18:33.654
- OW.

18:33.737 --> 18:34.780
- MANNERS, ALFRED.

18:34.863 --> 18:36.365
YOU KNOW, JEROME,

18:36.448 --> 18:39.910
I'M ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT
FOR AN APPRENTICE.

18:39.993 --> 18:43.622
HMM,
A BUSINESS LIKE MINE

18:43.705 --> 18:45.791
COULD ALWAYS DO
WITH FRESH BLOOD.

18:45.874 --> 18:47.167
- BACK OFF, JEROME.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.545
THEY'RE MY OVERSTRETCHED,
CONTROL-FREAK PARENTS,

18:49.628 --> 18:50.546
NOT YOURS.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.047
- OKAY.

18:52.130 --> 18:53.549
- WHERE ARE NINA AND AMBER?

18:53.632 --> 18:56.343
- PROBABLY MARKING OUT
THE HORSES, EH, ALFRED?

18:56.426 --> 18:57.553
- WHAT HORSES?

18:57.636 --> 18:59.555
- THE SCHOOL HORSES,
FABIAN,

18:59.638 --> 19:00.556
AND I HOPE YOU FINISH POLISHING
THE SILVERWARE.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.558
- OH.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.143
OH, OKAY.

19:04.226 --> 19:07.771
I'LL JUST GO AND LOOK
FOR THEM, THEN.

19:07.855 --> 19:11.483
- UH, YES, DISMISSED.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.862
A BIT BETTER THAN THAT MOLDY,
OLD SANDWICH

19:14.945 --> 19:17.322
YOU BROUGHT ME THIS MORNING.

19:17.406 --> 19:18.448
- THINK YOURSELF LUCKY
THAT YOU'RE GETTING

19:18.532 --> 19:24.121
ANYTHING AT ALL AFTER THE TRICKS
YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING.

19:24.204 --> 19:25.831
YOU CAN HAVE THIS BACK,

19:25.914 --> 19:29.334
ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T DESERVE IT.

19:31.378 --> 19:34.047
- WHY ARE YOU SO INTERESTING
IN JOY?

19:34.131 --> 19:35.048
- NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

19:35.132 --> 19:36.341
- AND WHAT'S YOUR CONNECTION

19:36.425 --> 19:39.219
TO SARAH FROBISHER-SMYTHE
AND VICTOR.

19:39.303 --> 19:42.180
- OH, THOSE RIVERS GO BACK
A LONG WAY.

19:42.264 --> 19:45.726
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW.

19:45.809 --> 19:47.728
- THIS IS FREAKY.

19:47.811 --> 19:48.937
- FREAKY?

19:49.021 --> 19:52.065
NAH, WHAT'S FREAKY
ABOUT AN OLD,

19:52.149 --> 19:54.484
ABANDONED WAREHOUSE
IN THE WOODS?

19:54.568 --> 19:56.069
- DO YOU THINK PATRICIA'S
IN THERE?

19:56.153 --> 19:59.072
- WELL, THERE'S NO SIGN
OF RUFUS' VAN.

19:59.156 --> 19:59.615
- HE'S DEFINITELY BEEN HERE.

19:59.698 --> 20:03.660
LOOK.

20:03.744 --> 20:04.745
- OKAY,
LET'S GO CHECK INSIDE.

20:04.828 --> 20:05.662
- I JUST REMEMBERED,

20:05.746 --> 20:07.748
I HAVE A REALLY IMPORTANT
FACIAL SCHEDULED

20:07.831 --> 20:10.250
AND CHEMISTRY HOMEWORK
THAT WON'T WRITE ITSELF, SO...

20:10.334 --> 20:14.963
- AMBER, THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE SCARED ABOUT, OKAY?

20:15.047 --> 20:16.715
I'M SURE IT'S JUST SOME OLD,
ABANDONED FACTORY.

20:16.798 --> 20:19.301
WE CAN HANDLE IT.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.553
- OR WE COULD JUST NOT GO IN.

20:21.637 --> 20:24.640
- THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT, OKAY?

20:24.723 --> 20:25.390
WE CAN GO BACK IF YOU WANT.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.483
- OH, YES.

20:34.566 --> 20:39.655
- LOOK.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.824
IT'S STILL WARM.
THEY'VE ONLY JUST LEFT.

20:42.908 --> 20:43.867
THIS IS PATRICIA'S TOO.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.160
SHE'S BEEN HERE.

20:45.243 --> 20:45.661
- WHERE IS SHE NOW,
AND WHERE'S RUFUS?

20:45.744 --> 20:47.871
NINA! AMBER!

20:47.955 --> 20:49.790
- OH!
