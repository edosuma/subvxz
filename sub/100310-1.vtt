01:23.160 --> 01:25.117
So, meiosis is the process by which

01:25.200 --> 01:28.113
a cell divides and splits up
the number of chromosomes.

01:28.200 --> 01:30.476
Now, this is different
than mitosis, remember,

01:30.600 --> 01:33.513
it'll form what are called "gametes."

01:33.600 --> 01:35.432
All right, does this
make sense to everybody?

01:35.600 --> 01:37.398
All right, now each gamete
contains 50%...

01:37.480 --> 01:39.790
We're just gonna, like,
wreck your house.

01:39.880 --> 01:40.950
It's gonna be so rad.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.110
Who's even coming?

01:42.200 --> 01:45.079
Yeah, is it gonna be, like,
super exclusive? What's the deal?

01:45.160 --> 01:48.278
It's a back-to-school party,
you dumb beezees. Everyone's coming.

01:49.720 --> 01:52.440
Sara can even bring her <i>D&D</i> BFF,
for all I care.

01:55.360 --> 01:56.760
We're not even friends anymore.

01:58.040 --> 01:59.952
And we didn't play <i>D&D</i>,
it was <i>Magic...</i>

02:02.520 --> 02:04.120
Uh, yes, Hayley?

02:04.720 --> 02:08.157
Amoebas and stuff
can split into two, right?

02:08.240 --> 02:10.151
- Like, asexually?
- That's right.

02:10.639 --> 02:14.031
So, if that works, then why is
sexual reproduction even a thing?

02:14.120 --> 02:15.952
Uh, 'cause it's super fun.

02:17.041 --> 02:19.953
Actually,
that's a terrific question.

02:20.200 --> 02:21.920
- What a Margaret.
- Shyeah.

02:22.240 --> 02:26.200
Hey, did you get 151?
I'm trying to get real faded.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.674
- Oh, me, too.
- Me, too.

02:27.800 --> 02:29.680
I'm going to get maybe even,
like, double-faded.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.952
Ooh, cold.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.474
So, did you live at the hotel pool?

02:53.400 --> 02:54.400
Huh?

02:54.720 --> 02:56.518
You're just super tan.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.432
From Mexico?

02:59.520 --> 03:00.520
Oh.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.840
- I guess.
- It looks really good.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.279
I'm not trying to roast you or anything.

03:11.080 --> 03:13.800
Hey, did you write down
the bio reading? I...

03:13.960 --> 03:17.795
Sara. We're on
different paths now, okay?

03:18.800 --> 03:19.720
Okay.

03:19.721 --> 03:22.475
So, can we just let that be?

03:22.600 --> 03:23.760
You know, I'm moving forward.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.434
No, yeah, I get it.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.434
You want to focus
on lacrosse and college.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.594
Sure. Yeah. Uh, there's that.

03:33.240 --> 03:35.391
I thought the sex thing
wasn't a big deal?

03:35.520 --> 03:38.035
Yeah, well, I've changed a lot
this summer.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.759
All right? My priorities are...

03:44.880 --> 03:46.872
different, okay?

03:51.400 --> 03:53.153
Hey, Sara.

03:55.760 --> 03:59.913
It's pages 24 through 43.
Skip the lab questions on 30.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.514
- Hey, Skyler!
- What's up, Skyler?

04:13.600 --> 04:15.881
Hey, Sear-bear, I'm headed to class.
You do your homework?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.149
Did you do yours?

04:17.480 --> 04:18.596
Zing!

04:18.880 --> 04:19.880
Seriously, you do it yet?

04:21.680 --> 04:23.239
That's what I'm talking about.

04:23.320 --> 04:26.791
Ten thousand hours, baby,
then you're gonna be a big-time CEO.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.473
That's not even a real thing.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.235
Are you wearing makeup?

04:31.440 --> 04:34.512
No, I just moisturized.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.635
It's called making an effort.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.400
Okay.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.313
Everything peachy in your world, baby?

04:44.600 --> 04:46.637
Yup.
Can you close the door, please?

04:47.080 --> 04:50.710
All right. I'll get out of your hair.
Be good.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.080
Hey.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.319
Hey.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.353
I thought we could...

05:14.440 --> 05:15.715
talk?

05:18.080 --> 05:19.080
Huh?

05:35.160 --> 05:36.355
Do you have a condom?

05:42.320 --> 05:43.959
Just pull out.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.149
I will.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.434
Ow!

06:11.080 --> 06:12.080
Ow!

06:13.960 --> 06:15.155
Aah!

06:15.880 --> 06:17.712
Ow! Ow!

06:17.880 --> 06:19.837
Ow! Ow! Ow!

06:20.000 --> 06:21.992
Ouch! Ow!

06:22.120 --> 06:24.954
Oh!

06:36.120 --> 06:37.600
Felt so good.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.032
Yeah. Amazing.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.599
Did you pull out?

06:48.520 --> 06:49.874
It's okay.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.514
It's okay.

06:53.680 --> 06:54.680
I'm sure it's...

07:45.880 --> 07:47.155
Jesus!

07:48.440 --> 07:51.478
I just came to see
if everything was okay. Shit.

07:55.880 --> 07:56.880
So...

07:59.440 --> 08:01.079
is everything okay?

08:01.840 --> 08:04.355
Yeah. Thanks.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.949
Tegan's thigh gap
is so much better than mine.

08:14.040 --> 08:15.040
Pouty face.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.750
Oh, my God, Ki, yours is amaze.
And mine's only because of gymnastics.

08:18.920 --> 08:20.195
God, I should join.

08:20.320 --> 08:22.596
That's cray.
It's, like, a really big commitment.

08:22.760 --> 08:25.320
But I love it. Plus, my mom won't
let me quit, so, who cares?

08:25.520 --> 08:28.240
My thigh gap is such garbage...

08:30.920 --> 08:31.990
Feeling better?

08:32.600 --> 08:34.511
Mmm-hmm, I'm fine.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.576
My favorite part was right before,
when you were like,

08:37.600 --> 08:39.352
"Oh, I love my boyfriend."

08:39.480 --> 08:42.154
And then you totally barfed
all over him.

08:43.640 --> 08:46.155
Why are you so obsessed with me?

08:49.080 --> 08:50.958
I'm... I'm not.

08:52.600 --> 08:56.037
I'm just telling everybody the story
because it's a super funny story.

08:56.280 --> 09:01.116
Yeah, you're, like,
the funniest one of our friends, Kiana.

09:08.480 --> 09:11.120
Hey, Sara, uh, is everything cool?

09:20.720 --> 09:24.031
Talk about mood swings.
What are you, like, pregnant?

09:29.160 --> 09:31.834
That'd be hilarious.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.016
What are you guys
doing this weekend?

09:35.040 --> 09:36.160
Shopping, obviously.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.991
Oh, thank Christ.

10:34.641 --> 10:37.997
Sara!
Welcome to the land of the living.

10:39.520 --> 10:40.636
Sara!

10:57.040 --> 10:58.520
W-T-Fuck!

11:00.560 --> 11:01.755
W-T-Fuck!

11:08.240 --> 11:10.038
I'm coming in.
Hide your shame.

11:44.280 --> 11:45.794
Okay.

11:49.760 --> 11:51.956
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

11:52.200 --> 11:54.157
- Hey!
- Hey, you.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.440
I was just thinking about you.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.120
<i>I called you
a bunch last night.</i>

11:57.200 --> 11:59.954
Yeah, I wasn't feeling awesome.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.837
So, how are you feeling?

12:03.920 --> 12:05.400
<i>Uh, I'm okay.</i>

12:07.520 --> 12:10.240
Actually, now that you mentioned it...

12:11.160 --> 12:13.436
<i>I have been feeling really...</i>

12:15.880 --> 12:17.678
horny.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.440
Wanna come over?

12:21.680 --> 12:25.037
I'd love to, but I'm stuck
with my mom all day. So lame.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.440
I'll see you later. Kisses. Bye!

12:26.520 --> 12:28.536
Hey, we're still going
to Kiana's together, though, right?

12:30.320 --> 12:31.834
- Hey, bitch.
- Kiana, hey.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.760
Oh, my God, shut up for a second.
Did you hear?

12:33.800 --> 12:36.110
Amy P got schwasted
and hooked up with Joey C.

12:36.240 --> 12:38.630
They did it in his Scion, so grody.

12:38.760 --> 12:41.116
That's all DL, by the way.
Amy's supes embarrassed about it

12:41.200 --> 12:43.157
and made me promise not to tell anyone.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.880
Also, she pegged him. So, what's up?

12:59.720 --> 13:03.270
- So, why are you here?
- Uh...

13:04.240 --> 13:05.560
Hello?

13:05.680 --> 13:07.320
Okay,
I'm just trying to, like...

13:08.320 --> 13:11.631
Like, where's Kiana?
Aren't you guys, like, besties now?

13:11.720 --> 13:15.509
I mean, I just thought
you would help me, or whatever.

13:17.520 --> 13:18.590
What?

13:19.240 --> 13:20.799
Nothing. You just...

13:22.160 --> 13:24.880
kind of totally ghosted me
sophomore year.

13:25.400 --> 13:28.791
What? I've seen you.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.513
Whatever. Never mind.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.678
Hayley, I'm really freaking here.

13:33.800 --> 13:38.079
Sorry, it's just a lot to take in.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.075
Shyeah.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.556
It doesn't make sense.
I saw you yesterday.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.309
Puking my guts out.
Morning sickness much?

13:46.400 --> 13:47.959
Whatever's happening here is...

13:48.040 --> 13:49.918
Completely batshit!

13:50.440 --> 13:52.159
...gynecological.

13:52.240 --> 13:53.799
You need to go to a hospital.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.679
Hmm, veto. They'll call my mom.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.513
Are you serious?

13:57.680 --> 13:58.909
This is triage, Hayley.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.994
Priority one, is keeping this quiet.

14:02.120 --> 14:06.000
Priority two, is my health
and general overall well-being.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.354
Okay. So, you want a place
that's confidential,

14:10.440 --> 14:12.671
maybe knows a way
around a freaky surprise pregnancy,

14:12.760 --> 14:16.470
and hey, hopefully doesn't
cost anything either, because why not?

14:21.040 --> 14:24.795
We're all human beings in God's eyes!

14:24.920 --> 14:26.673
It's not too late to turn around.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.999
There is still time for forgiveness.

14:30.080 --> 14:33.835
Don't make a decision you'll regret
for the rest of your life!

14:34.000 --> 14:36.640
Forgive this harlot, Lord,
she knows not what she does.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.433
Jesus loves you!

14:42.600 --> 14:43.600
Bitch!

14:59.720 --> 15:02.554
I guess those opium orgies
really paid off, huh?

15:02.640 --> 15:06.953
Okay, I told you it was my first time,
so, stop slut-shaming me.

15:08.040 --> 15:11.556
And sex is, like, a totally natural,
healthy part of life, anyway.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.792
Where is Skyler, anyway?

15:18.680 --> 15:20.280
- You should call him...
- Don't!

15:23.120 --> 15:24.600
It's not Skyler.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.594
That's the whole reason
we broke up in the first place.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.194
I wanted to wait.

15:33.440 --> 15:34.715
Oh, that's probably good.

15:35.840 --> 15:37.832
Skyler was always
kind of a sleaze, anyway.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.276
And cocky, and a douche.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.200
Oh, my God, was it Joey C?

15:45.280 --> 15:46.280
Is...

15:46.360 --> 15:50.354
Hayley, it doesn't matter.
Would you just lay off, please?

15:51.840 --> 15:56.710
I just don't understand why you
dragged me into this, instead of...

15:58.280 --> 15:59.839
Mark?

16:00.120 --> 16:04.080
I'm gonna get back to this questionnaire
because it's slightly less invasive.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.915
So, how far along are you?

16:14.320 --> 16:15.390
A day.

16:17.160 --> 16:20.232
And I know that sounds, like,
super cray.

16:20.560 --> 16:23.917
Sara, you didn't just
go to sleep last night,

16:24.000 --> 16:25.559
and wake up nine months pregnant.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.110
It's pretty cray.

16:39.720 --> 16:42.189
I'm so effed.

16:42.320 --> 16:45.757
No. I'm sure Zack
will still support you.

16:45.840 --> 16:49.436
Not having this convo again.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.080
Okay. I'm just, I'm just confused.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.336
You know, I thought you wanted to wait
for this sort of thing.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.296
Isn't that the whole reason
why you broke up with that man slut?

16:55.320 --> 16:56.515
Skyler's not a man slut.

16:59.640 --> 17:00.960
He was all tan.

17:01.080 --> 17:02.080
Ugh.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.071
He just got back from Mexico.

17:08.440 --> 17:09.920
Mexico.

17:16.079 --> 17:18.356
Wait. What is...

17:25.319 --> 17:29.599
Um... Yeah. Um, okay.

17:30.720 --> 17:31.870
I'll be right back.

17:33.560 --> 17:35.552
I'm sure everything's fine.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.194
I'm gonna go get a doctor.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.720
I need you to look.

17:47.560 --> 17:48.789
I hate you.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.080
Whoa! Okay, that was way more butthole
than I was expecting.

18:03.160 --> 18:06.995
Don't be such a prude. Come on!
Is it, like, crowning?

18:07.080 --> 18:08.150
Ugh.

18:15.400 --> 18:16.436
Oh!

18:16.600 --> 18:17.750
What the hell!

18:18.040 --> 18:20.157
I think that was a contraction.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.816
You didn't tell me
she was in labor.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.240
How far apart are the contractions?

18:25.440 --> 18:26.440
Aah!

18:27.600 --> 18:28.600
Very close!

18:29.440 --> 18:30.635
We need to do this now.

18:30.720 --> 18:31.915
Richard. Richard...

18:33.400 --> 18:35.073
Richard, I'm telling you,

18:35.160 --> 18:36.958
there's something weird
on that sonogram.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.350
That's why I'm here.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.437
Ew. No, no, no, no, can't she do it?

18:43.080 --> 18:45.879
Yeah, there's, like, a lot of butthole.

18:45.960 --> 18:47.519
Miss, I'm an OB-GYN.

18:47.680 --> 18:50.991
There's nothing down here
I haven't seen before.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.235
Aah!

19:24.360 --> 19:27.159
- What the hell was that thing?
- Not a baby!

19:27.240 --> 19:29.072
- No doy.
- Yeah, no doy, no doy.

19:29.160 --> 19:30.355
This is why you use a condom.

19:30.480 --> 19:33.040
Oh, this is so not
why you use a condom.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.240
Holy shit!

20:54.720 --> 20:55.720
Run!

20:58.280 --> 20:59.634
Keys!

21:05.480 --> 21:08.518
- What the shit was that?
- Definitely not a baby!

21:23.440 --> 21:26.319
<i>Hey, Ruiz,
we got a call in of a possible 217</i>

21:26.400 --> 21:29.120
<i>at that clinic on Mesa Way.
Think you can check it out?</i>

21:31.440 --> 21:35.957
Yeah, I'm on the south side.
Uh, why can't Anderson get it?

21:36.040 --> 21:37.520
<i>It's his birthday.</i>

21:39.160 --> 21:40.276
So?

21:41.040 --> 21:42.793
<i>So, we got ice cream cake
at the station.</i>

21:42.880 --> 21:44.336
<i>If we don't eat it soon,
it will melt.</i>

21:44.360 --> 21:46.397
Great.

21:47.520 --> 21:50.274
Yeah, all right. I'm on it.

21:50.360 --> 21:53.159
Oh, uh, save me a slice, yeah?

21:53.240 --> 21:55.232
<i>It's ice cream cake, Oscar.</i>

22:32.000 --> 22:33.275
What?

22:38.200 --> 22:40.510
It's just,
the swelling hasn't gone down yet.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.678
That's not how it works. Is it?

22:42.760 --> 22:45.434
- I don't know. I opted out of health.
- Yeah, big surprise.

22:56.880 --> 22:59.190
- Ew, ew, ew, ew!
- What is happening?

22:59.320 --> 23:01.073
What do we do? What do we do?
What do we do?

23:01.160 --> 23:04.995
Okay, okay. Uh, we should call the cops.

23:06.160 --> 23:08.470
Okay, that's a good first idea.
Let's keep brainstorming.

23:08.560 --> 23:11.394
- Sara!
- Oh, like they'd believe any of this.

23:11.520 --> 23:14.877
And also, I'd prefer not to vag-cannon
anyone else tonight.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.878
It's called saving a life.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.431
And they'll call my mom, yes.

23:21.560 --> 23:24.359
Fine! Then we call Skyler right now.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.959
What's plan "C"?

23:27.320 --> 23:30.313
Dude, he knows something,
remember? Mexico?

23:31.320 --> 23:33.471
That was a brief lapse of xenophobia.

23:34.520 --> 23:37.399
I don't want him getting involved
in this. You don't understand.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.034
Yeah. No, I don't.

23:40.240 --> 23:41.480
He'll freak out, and I don't...

23:42.560 --> 23:44.392
And, hi, the vag-cannon thing again.

23:44.480 --> 23:45.880
Oh, whatever!

23:46.040 --> 23:48.396
Okay, don't get huffy.
We're still exploring.

23:48.520 --> 23:49.556
Okay, okay, okay...

23:50.520 --> 23:51.670
How tall's your staircase?

23:52.880 --> 23:53.996
Wow.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.635
We are really scraping the bottom
of the idea barrel here.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.056
How about we just slap you
on the kitchen counter

23:59.080 --> 24:00.160
and aim you at the Vitamix?

24:09.640 --> 24:12.109
This better be the last time
I see that butthole tonight.

24:16.120 --> 24:17.236
Hello!

24:19.640 --> 24:20.835
Sinners?

25:01.400 --> 25:02.400
Sinner.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.949
Nothing, just making smoothies.

25:36.320 --> 25:37.913
Yes, I fed them.

25:38.920 --> 25:40.036
Okay, love you, too.

25:41.360 --> 25:42.714
It's not coming out.

25:42.880 --> 25:43.880
Try pushing.

25:43.920 --> 25:46.674
If I push any harder,
I'm gonna shit on the counter.

25:46.920 --> 25:47.920
Ugh.

25:49.480 --> 25:52.518
I can't find anything
about a Mexican pregnancy monster.

25:53.520 --> 25:56.513
It's all just freaky Reddit threads.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.149
Ew.

25:59.520 --> 26:03.196
You know, I think if this is a thing
people knew about,

26:03.280 --> 26:05.192
we'd know. You know?

26:06.960 --> 26:09.759
Sara, I forgot my books.
Are you in the kitchen?

26:14.480 --> 26:16.119
- Hayley.
- Kate!

26:18.000 --> 26:19.195
Hey!

26:19.280 --> 26:22.671
Holy crap! Sweetie, give me a hug!

26:22.760 --> 26:25.639
Oh, let me come to you!

26:29.680 --> 26:32.354
Oh, I haven't seen you
in forever and a day.

26:32.440 --> 26:35.831
- Yeah.
- You look so... Oh, my God.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.229
You look like a grownup.

26:37.360 --> 26:40.637
And you're doing that school thing,
which is awesome.

26:40.720 --> 26:44.236
Yes. Hospitality training.
Gonna be a modern working woman.

26:44.400 --> 26:45.436
Girl power.

26:46.840 --> 26:48.433
- Where's Sara?
- Bathroom.

26:48.680 --> 26:50.637
Ha! Story of her life.

26:53.120 --> 26:56.158
Oh, it is just so good to see you.

26:56.760 --> 26:58.114
I know.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.200
It is just...

27:02.920 --> 27:04.696
It is so good to see
you two hanging out again.

27:04.720 --> 27:05.720
Yeah.

27:07.080 --> 27:10.869
I don't know what is up with her lately,
but she just seems kind of...

27:11.120 --> 27:12.998
Uh...

27:14.040 --> 27:15.759
- You know?
- Really?

27:16.720 --> 27:17.720
No.

27:17.920 --> 27:20.310
I don't know.

27:20.480 --> 27:24.872
I feel like I'm losing my sweet girl
to this person I don't recognize.

27:27.160 --> 27:30.358
I totally didn't notice.

27:30.840 --> 27:33.036
Well, you've always had your head
screwed on straight.

27:33.120 --> 27:34.236
Sara's head is up her ass.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.280
Well, I'm off.

27:38.640 --> 27:40.279
Bye, Sara, be good.

27:43.880 --> 27:46.600
Okay, she's gone for now,
but we cannot stick around here forever.

27:46.760 --> 27:49.400
- Any changes?
- No, it's not coming out.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.276
So, what do we do? Just, like, wait?

27:52.440 --> 27:54.671
I can't just Juno around town
with this thing.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.553
We gotta get proactive.

27:56.720 --> 27:57.756
Okay, um...

27:58.840 --> 28:00.399
This says spicy foods can help.

28:01.400 --> 28:02.754
Subsum Thai is open till 9:00.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.998
Uh, wait, no, this is Yahoo! Answers.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.430
We need actual science.

28:10.040 --> 28:12.794
Oh, my God, we go see Dave.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.231
No, come on. Dave?

28:16.560 --> 28:19.394
I was leading this cabin tour once
and one of the alpacas,

28:19.560 --> 28:21.552
she was three weeks late,
and Dave shot this stuff

28:21.640 --> 28:23.120
into her that made her give birth.

28:23.920 --> 28:25.673
Yeah, but that's an animal.

28:25.840 --> 28:27.115
Exactly.

28:28.120 --> 28:29.520
He's not gonna believe us.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.031
Or, we could call the cops.

28:40.600 --> 28:41.600
Yowser.

28:44.840 --> 28:47.480
Hey, Dispatch,
we're gonna need an ambulance.

28:50.040 --> 28:51.520
And the coroner.

28:56.040 --> 29:00.557
Just try not to
leak on anything back there.

29:00.800 --> 29:04.350
Yeah, I wouldn't want to ruin
your stunning upholstery.

29:04.560 --> 29:06.472
- Hey, I just thought of something.
- Yeah?

29:07.680 --> 29:10.673
We left that thingy
in the clinic, right?

29:11.400 --> 29:12.400
Uh-huh.

29:12.440 --> 29:15.717
Well, like, oops, right?
It could hurt more people.

29:16.080 --> 29:17.196
Maybe he's...

29:19.640 --> 29:20.640
dead.

29:27.960 --> 29:28.960
Yeah.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.591
But probably not, right?

29:35.080 --> 29:37.640
Maybe he's just, like...

29:39.960 --> 29:41.235
chillin' at the clinic.

29:46.920 --> 29:47.990
Yeah.

29:51.800 --> 29:53.678
But probably not, right?

29:54.360 --> 29:55.476
Mmm.

29:57.080 --> 30:02.200
Okay, let's deal with this guy,
and then we'll go back.

30:02.720 --> 30:06.919
Yeah, if we don't die,
we will definitely go back.

30:11.560 --> 30:12.630
Cool.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.036
Dave.

30:47.480 --> 30:50.393
- Hayley?
- Hey.

30:50.480 --> 30:52.517
Uh... Did I call you in?

30:53.000 --> 30:55.435
No, but we kind of need your help.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.278
Sara Steinberg?

31:01.120 --> 31:04.272
Come out here!
Let me take a look at you!

31:07.520 --> 31:08.520
Ah...

31:10.840 --> 31:14.117
So, Sara had sex with some guy
and got pregnant overnight,

31:14.200 --> 31:16.800
and we went to the clinic,
but she gave birth to this weird thing,

31:16.840 --> 31:18.911
and it exploded a doctor's head,

31:19.000 --> 31:21.120
and controlled a nurse
like a puppet with its stinger,

31:21.160 --> 31:23.391
and now, she has
another one inside of her,

31:23.480 --> 31:24.596
and we need to get it out.

31:25.680 --> 31:28.240
And we know that sounds super cray.

31:31.360 --> 31:34.239
It's a parasite. A Dracunculus.

31:34.400 --> 31:37.154
Or blood fluke or something.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.118
Ugh! A blood fluke?

31:39.200 --> 31:43.399
Yeah, it's a type of flatworm.
This is hot.

31:43.720 --> 31:45.313
So, I have worms?

31:45.440 --> 31:47.636
No, no, no, no.

31:47.720 --> 31:51.191
What you have
is much freakier than that.

31:51.320 --> 31:54.472
So, what kind of parasite can just
hijack a human reproductive system?

31:54.680 --> 31:57.479
Or a whole human, while we're at it.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.996
I can consult my literature,

32:00.160 --> 32:03.153
but I'm pretty sure I haven't
heard anything like this before.

32:03.240 --> 32:07.234
I mean, Sara, you may have discovered
a whole new species.

32:07.960 --> 32:08.960
Goodie.

32:10.840 --> 32:13.400
This guy you got down with,

32:13.760 --> 32:15.752
had he altered his routine at all?

32:15.840 --> 32:17.433
Gone spelunking?

32:17.560 --> 32:21.270
Eaten something gnarly?
Been bitten by a rabid dog?

32:21.360 --> 32:23.431
Well, he did just come back from Mexico.

32:23.520 --> 32:24.520
Mexico?

32:27.160 --> 32:30.153
Not in an ethnocentric way,
or anything, but...

32:31.760 --> 32:36.994
maybe lover boy came back
with an illegal alien.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.030
Whoa.

32:42.880 --> 32:45.475
Whoa, indeed,
<i>caballero.</i>

32:46.680 --> 32:47.830
Whoa, indeed.

32:50.920 --> 32:53.196
Whatever! You can get it
out of me, right?

32:54.840 --> 32:55.876
Probably.

32:57.120 --> 32:59.336
Hey, I checked on
that Steinberg address. No one was home.

32:59.360 --> 33:00.919
Any news on that corpse?

33:02.160 --> 33:03.833
<i>Nope.
Still dead.</i>

33:57.161 --> 34:00.837
- Holy shit.
- It's still here.

34:04.120 --> 34:07.477
I completely forgot about this.
Do you think he knows?

34:14.120 --> 34:15.270
Um...

34:16.719 --> 34:18.598
Why did you stop coming?

34:25.679 --> 34:28.114
Skyler. I totally spaced.

34:30.480 --> 34:31.440
Hey, Boo.

34:31.440 --> 34:32.617
<i>You totally
didn't respond to my text.</i>

34:32.639 --> 34:34.320
Are we rolling to Kiana's together,
or not?

34:34.520 --> 34:36.955
Oh, my God, I completely forgot, Sky.

34:37.120 --> 34:38.349
We talked this morning.

34:38.440 --> 34:41.989
I know, I just...
I got this stomach bug, all of a sudden.

34:46.080 --> 34:47.799
I miss you.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.871
Yeah, yeah, it's fine. Whatever. Um...

34:50.480 --> 34:51.516
I'm sorry you're sick.

34:51.800 --> 34:52.760
Thanks.

34:52.761 --> 34:55.672
It's just,
I just really want to see you.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.036
You know, and I want to kiss you.

34:58.240 --> 35:00.038
And I want to be with you...

35:00.160 --> 35:01.196
sexually.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.400
Ah.

35:02.840 --> 35:04.360
I just really want to see you tonight!

35:04.880 --> 35:08.840
Yeah, I know, but I think
it'll be out of my system soon.

35:09.800 --> 35:10.800
I love you!

35:12.520 --> 35:13.556
What?

35:14.000 --> 35:15.514
I fucking love you, girl.

35:15.680 --> 35:17.433
<i>I love you.</i>

35:17.840 --> 35:18.840
Wow.

35:19.720 --> 35:21.720
Okay, I get it. You're sick. Bye.

35:25.120 --> 35:26.236
That was weird.

35:26.520 --> 35:27.556
Huh.

35:30.360 --> 35:34.559
He was just acting super weird.
I don't know.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.479
Sara, you gotta tell him.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.030
Are you kidding?

35:39.120 --> 35:40.998
We are almost home free.
Why would I tell him?

35:41.120 --> 35:44.158
Oh, my God, like, a hundred reasons!

35:44.320 --> 35:46.896
How do we know that he still doesn't
have something inside of him?

35:46.920 --> 35:48.752
In his nards.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.394
Uh, 'cause it's inside me now.

35:50.600 --> 35:53.798
Okay, or how about the fact that
the father should step up, maybe?

35:54.000 --> 35:55.832
Why does Skyler get a free pass?

35:56.520 --> 35:58.989
You're perpetuating
some serious patriarchal bullshit.

35:59.160 --> 36:01.550
This is not the time for
a "free the nipple" uprising.

36:01.680 --> 36:04.832
Sorry, but this all started
with Skyler, right?

36:05.960 --> 36:07.952
What am I missing?

36:08.840 --> 36:11.514
You've never had a boyfriend.
You wouldn't understand.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.400
Ready?

36:32.560 --> 36:33.676
You okay?

36:35.240 --> 36:38.916
Uh, sure. I've just never done this
on a human before.

36:41.800 --> 36:42.916
Uh...

36:44.400 --> 36:46.119
Sorry, it's gotta reach the uterus.

36:47.360 --> 36:52.037
Uterotonic can induce contractions,
and ultimately, labor.

36:52.680 --> 36:53.680
Uh-huh.

36:53.720 --> 36:54.870
Forty ccs.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
A little more.

37:02.440 --> 37:03.440
A little more.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.313
Oh, baby.

37:12.880 --> 37:13.880
Okay.

37:26.520 --> 37:27.840
Here we go.

38:18.080 --> 38:19.719
- Push!
- I did!

38:19.920 --> 38:20.920
Push harder!

38:21.080 --> 38:22.480
Why didn't it work? Dave?

38:22.600 --> 38:26.560
I don't know! It should have!
It must have hung on.

38:26.720 --> 38:29.155
You're saying it wants to stay inside?

38:29.360 --> 38:31.352
The uterotonic, give me more!

38:31.520 --> 38:33.671
- I can't.
- Why not?

38:33.920 --> 38:36.276
Because this is dangerous stuff.

38:36.360 --> 38:40.673
And if I gave anymore, it would risk
terminating the pregnancy altogether.

38:42.520 --> 38:46.309
I realized what I said as soon as
it came out of my mouth.

38:46.400 --> 38:47.400
I'll get some more.

38:51.200 --> 38:53.237
Why would it want to stay inside?

38:53.320 --> 38:55.516
Maybe it's waiting for something.

38:56.400 --> 38:57.400
For what?

39:01.760 --> 39:03.035
The other guy?

39:17.560 --> 39:19.233
Oh, fart.

39:19.800 --> 39:21.757
Hey, me and Harris and Alyssa,

39:21.880 --> 39:24.634
we're going down to Toto's
for some margaritas.

39:24.720 --> 39:25.720
- Ooh.
- Whoo!

39:25.721 --> 39:29.237
- Are you interested?
- Oh, that sounds amazing.

39:29.320 --> 39:32.518
But I think I'm gonna go home and
get ignored by my daughter instead.

39:35.320 --> 39:36.920
All right, well, I'm gonna go get drunk.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.515
Okay. You have fun.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.434
Be safe!

39:55.720 --> 39:56.720
Hello?

39:58.240 --> 39:59.240
What?

40:00.800 --> 40:01.800
What?

40:04.080 --> 40:05.230
She's what?

40:26.560 --> 40:29.632
I can't believe you!
I literally cannot believe you!

40:29.720 --> 40:32.216
- Mom, it's not what you think!
- After everything we talked about,

40:32.240 --> 40:35.517
- you go and you have unprotected sex?
- You're not listening!

40:35.600 --> 40:37.512
- She did, but...
- Stay out of this, Hayley.

40:37.640 --> 40:40.997
- It was one time.
- One's enough, Sara, obviously!

40:41.200 --> 40:42.634
- Forget college.
- Ma'am, uh...

40:42.720 --> 40:44.916
Oh, you see these shows
where the girl gets pregnant,

40:45.000 --> 40:46.056
and the mom doesn't notice,

40:46.080 --> 40:47.720
and you think,
"How could you not notice?"

40:47.840 --> 40:50.150
And here I am, and I didn't notice.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.560
How could I not notice?

40:51.680 --> 40:53.696
Ma'am, I need to ask the girls
some questions about an incident.

40:53.720 --> 40:55.837
Christ, Sear-bear.
How could you do this to yourself?

40:55.920 --> 40:57.036
Oh, you're one to talk.

40:57.120 --> 40:58.759
Excuse me, young lady!

40:58.840 --> 41:01.753
Don't "young lady" me.
We're 15 years apart!

41:01.840 --> 41:05.675
Yes, Sara, I was just like you,
and I screwed up my life!

41:05.840 --> 41:09.595
Okay, let's just downshift here
for a second.

41:09.920 --> 41:11.673
Ma'am, you wanna
step out with me, please?

41:11.920 --> 41:13.416
- But there's an alien...
- An alien, right, I know.

41:13.440 --> 41:14.440
I don't believe you.

41:19.800 --> 41:22.269
- Hi.
- Uh, hi.

41:22.520 --> 41:24.512
You're being allowed in that room
as a courtesy.

41:24.600 --> 41:26.216
I have your daughter at the scene
of a serious crime,

41:26.240 --> 41:27.656
and what you're doing right now?
It's not helping me.

41:27.680 --> 41:29.176
- And it's definitely not helping your...
- Don't.

41:29.200 --> 41:31.271
Don't! You don't get to lecture me.

41:31.360 --> 41:32.376
- I'm not lecturing you.
- Who do you think you are,

41:32.400 --> 41:35.518
Officer Ruiz?
You're so off base here, it's crazy!

41:39.040 --> 41:41.316
You know you're, like,
not supposed to touch me, right?

41:43.160 --> 41:44.389
This whole thing is effed.

41:45.520 --> 41:46.556
Yeah.

41:47.560 --> 41:51.349
It's kind of why I didn't want
to involve cops in the first place.

41:51.480 --> 41:54.917
It is not my fault my parents
put a LoJack in my car.

41:55.040 --> 41:57.839
I know. Just saying.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.073
Sorry.

42:06.160 --> 42:08.072
It's just...

42:08.160 --> 42:11.198
my mom's so up her ass.

42:11.320 --> 42:14.074
And, hey,
where does she get off yelling at you?

42:16.280 --> 42:19.751
She's really pulling
a Water Zone 2010, huh?

42:19.880 --> 42:22.349
"I went to get corndogs for you girls,
and you disappear?

42:22.440 --> 42:24.193
I had them checking the parking lot."

42:24.360 --> 42:26.795
"Our home base was the towels!"

42:28.320 --> 42:30.073
You're scared right now, okay? I get it.

42:30.160 --> 42:32.441
This is so condescending.
You have no idea what it's like.

42:32.520 --> 42:33.520
I have a daughter, too.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.390
She's in Tampa with her mom.
She's only five.

42:36.480 --> 42:40.269
But if I were in your shoes right now,
I would also be freaking.

42:40.600 --> 42:43.274
- Right.
- But your daughter is scared, too.

42:43.520 --> 42:45.318
And she's fabricating
all of this alien stuff

42:45.400 --> 42:47.471
because she doesn't want to be judged.

42:47.560 --> 42:49.680
And the only way we're gonna
get some answers tonight,

42:49.720 --> 42:52.918
is if we approach the situation
with understanding. Okay?

42:57.280 --> 43:01.832
I'm gonna get a water. You want a water?
I mean, your throat must be raw.

43:06.920 --> 43:09.320
Hey, aren't you supposed
to be helping Ruiz with those girls?

43:09.600 --> 43:11.592
After a cigarette.

43:11.720 --> 43:13.996
You know he said that
two cigarettes ago, right?

43:14.080 --> 43:15.080
Did I?

43:16.000 --> 43:17.036
This guy...

43:35.400 --> 43:36.400
Sara.

43:37.880 --> 43:40.952
I was out of line before. I overreacted.

43:43.920 --> 43:45.912
I just hate to see you
making the same...

43:48.360 --> 43:49.874
I'm sorry.

43:50.800 --> 43:53.474
Do you want to tell me
and this officer what happened?

44:01.400 --> 44:02.595
I got pregnant.

44:03.800 --> 44:06.235
And what I gave birth to...

44:06.320 --> 44:07.754
was an alien.

44:07.840 --> 44:09.256
<i>Ay, Dios mío.</i>
What happened in that clinic?

44:09.280 --> 44:11.016
- We've told you a million times!
- I've got an unconscious nurse...

44:11.040 --> 44:12.656
- It's exactly what she said!
- ...a headless doctor, someone's

44:12.680 --> 44:15.320
- facing serious charges...
- I need everyone out for a second!

44:15.960 --> 44:17.394
- But...
- Out!

44:23.360 --> 44:24.360
Let's go, you.

44:58.680 --> 45:01.070
It's just you and me now, baby.

45:02.240 --> 45:05.790
Now, I know you didn't hurt anyone,

45:05.880 --> 45:07.439
and we'll get that sorted out.

45:07.520 --> 45:10.354
But right now, I just wanna talk to you

45:10.560 --> 45:12.074
about you.

45:12.960 --> 45:16.078
- Whatever you're going through...
- Mom, you have no idea

45:16.160 --> 45:17.355
what you're talking about.

45:17.480 --> 45:20.598
I know what this feels like.
I went through the exact same thing.

45:20.680 --> 45:22.080
- Mom...
- I just wanna make sure

45:22.240 --> 45:24.516
you're not punishing yourself.

45:26.600 --> 45:28.353
Stop trying to help me!

45:29.280 --> 45:31.158
I don't need an afterschool special!

45:31.280 --> 45:34.079
This is fucking worlds apart
from what you went through.

45:34.400 --> 45:36.915
I'm not gonna end up all sad and lonely.

45:37.280 --> 45:39.556
Just... Jesus!
You make me want to scream!

45:53.320 --> 45:55.118
Frankie, you okay?

46:08.640 --> 46:09.640
Told ya.

46:16.880 --> 46:21.671
Sir, are you aware
there's a lobster on your neck?

47:17.280 --> 47:18.714
Holding cell. Lock yourselves in.

47:21.440 --> 47:22.440
Mom!

47:28.320 --> 47:30.437
Wait! Don't come in!

47:30.840 --> 47:33.309
- Dave?
- Just don't look.

47:33.400 --> 47:36.518
I got nervous and had to deuce it.
Nobody look!

47:36.840 --> 47:38.160
No one's gonna look.

47:38.280 --> 47:40.320
What the hell's going on, Sara?
What was that thing?

47:40.360 --> 47:42.591
Okay, so, Sara had sex as you know,
duh, whatever,

47:42.680 --> 47:45.216
and then that thingy came flying out
of her vagina like a T-shirt cannon

47:45.240 --> 47:46.160
and started chasing us.

47:46.161 --> 47:47.841
And there's a second one
still inside Sara,

47:47.920 --> 47:51.038
and the first one wants
the second one for some reason. Got it?

47:51.120 --> 47:52.270
Uh, no.

47:52.400 --> 47:54.312
See, so, maybe
you should have listened earlier.

47:54.680 --> 47:56.114
You guys.

48:00.080 --> 48:01.116
What? What's wrong?

48:01.280 --> 48:03.875
That thingy can hop off
and come in through the bars.

48:04.040 --> 48:06.509
- We need a plan.
- We don't even know what it wants.

48:06.720 --> 48:08.576
I've been thinking about that,
and I have a theory.

48:08.600 --> 48:09.750
Don't look!

48:10.360 --> 48:13.910
It's tracking you, right?
Freaky-deaky stuff.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.151
The question is, why?

48:16.240 --> 48:20.439
Now, this thing and its brother
are communicating from a great distance.

48:20.760 --> 48:23.559
Some kind of sonar, like a bat.

48:23.640 --> 48:25.871
Maybe radio waves.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.151
Gamma waves.

48:28.320 --> 48:32.758
No, it's radio waves.
Probably radio waves.

48:32.840 --> 48:35.160
Yeah, science, science, science.
It already found us, Dave.

48:35.240 --> 48:38.790
So, this guy inside of you
is telling his buddy where you're at.

48:38.880 --> 48:41.156
Why? Well, in the animal kingdom,

48:41.560 --> 48:45.236
babies generally look to their mama
for one thing.

48:45.600 --> 48:48.434
It wants to breastfeed?

48:48.520 --> 48:51.877
It more wants to feed, feed,

48:52.080 --> 48:54.470
in general, on you.

48:55.480 --> 48:56.516
Sorry.

49:00.240 --> 49:01.390
But...

49:01.480 --> 49:03.836
Way too long a pause, Dave.

49:05.520 --> 49:07.352
The uterotonic is here.

49:07.480 --> 49:10.200
- "Utero" what-what?
- Mom, shut up.

49:10.280 --> 49:11.953
Where?

49:54.440 --> 49:56.875
Everyone ready?

49:57.040 --> 49:58.156
Oh, my God!

50:03.960 --> 50:05.713
Ew!

50:05.800 --> 50:08.110
Oh, my God. You touched it!
You touched it!

50:18.760 --> 50:19.910
Hi.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.496
What the hell are you guys doing here?

50:21.520 --> 50:23.955
We were going to get
the utero thingy to, um...

50:25.440 --> 50:28.239
I'm not really sure
I understand, actually.

50:32.960 --> 50:33.960
That's funny.

50:34.680 --> 50:35.680
Oh.

50:52.280 --> 50:53.316
Oh!

50:56.960 --> 50:58.440
There it is! Sick!

50:58.520 --> 51:01.035
Give it at least 100 ccs, ladies.

51:01.160 --> 51:02.389
What are you talking about?

51:02.480 --> 51:03.834
Get to the evidence room.

51:03.920 --> 51:05.115
- But...
- Go!

51:13.320 --> 51:14.800
Groovy.

51:25.240 --> 51:26.720
Uh...

51:31.040 --> 51:32.872
Shit!

51:36.000 --> 51:37.275
Oh, God!

51:38.880 --> 51:40.075
Shit!

51:41.240 --> 51:42.515
Uh...

52:07.640 --> 52:08.756
Go, go, go, go, go!

52:27.640 --> 52:29.279
No!

54:01.960 --> 54:03.110
<i>Sara?</i>

54:05.960 --> 54:07.189
Sara?

54:10.160 --> 54:11.355
You awake?

54:12.680 --> 54:14.239
My mom.

54:15.760 --> 54:16.830
I don't know.

54:17.600 --> 54:18.920
We've got to go find her.

54:19.880 --> 54:21.075
Yeah...

54:22.520 --> 54:25.399
That's why we're here.

54:34.560 --> 54:37.519
God, you're, like, good at this.

54:37.600 --> 54:39.080
Like, really good at this.

54:39.200 --> 54:41.840
It's just hand-eye coordination
from gymnastics.

54:41.920 --> 54:44.879
I hate it, but my mom
makes me do it. Whatever.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.229
Oh, wow.

54:46.560 --> 54:47.789
She'll be right back.

54:49.360 --> 54:50.953
- Blair.
- Oh, hey.

54:51.040 --> 54:52.872
- I told you to wait here for me.
- I was...

54:52.960 --> 54:54.296
I don't care what "you were just..."

54:54.320 --> 54:56.960
- Kick-ass party, Kiana.
- Thanks, Jess.

54:57.040 --> 55:00.317
You're so fucking sweet.
I love you so much.

55:01.040 --> 55:02.394
Skyler bailed.

55:02.480 --> 55:04.870
Sara obvi called him
and told him to leave.

55:04.960 --> 55:06.280
She's so jealous, it's insane.

55:06.400 --> 55:07.959
Jealous of what?

55:08.040 --> 55:09.713
Me and Skyler's friendship.

55:09.800 --> 55:11.536
We're friends.
We're really, really good friends.

55:11.560 --> 55:13.336
Like, we could take a nap together,
and it wouldn't mean anything.

55:13.360 --> 55:14.496
You know what I mean?

55:14.520 --> 55:16.193
- I...
- But Sara doesn't get that.

55:16.280 --> 55:17.714
I mean, what's her problem?

55:17.880 --> 55:19.553
She's ruining his life.
He should be here.

55:19.640 --> 55:22.075
You should text him
and tell him to come back.

55:22.160 --> 55:26.871
Jesus, Blair, he's with Sara.
Think before you speak.

55:28.560 --> 55:30.976
- This is all so fucked!
- Sky, can I please just talk to Hayley...

55:31.000 --> 55:34.755
I just saw a bunch of dead cops,
Sara, and I'm, like, freaking out!

55:34.840 --> 55:36.559
And she's talking about aliens?

55:36.640 --> 55:39.536
- It's complicated. I just need to...
- This is, like, go to jail shit, Sara!

55:39.560 --> 55:41.677
I need to know what's going on!

55:46.320 --> 55:48.596
- We had sex...
- Yeah.

55:49.400 --> 55:51.551
...I woke up pregnant...

55:53.240 --> 55:54.720
Oh, shit!

55:55.960 --> 55:59.590
- Are you sure?
- ...then I gave birth to, um...

56:01.240 --> 56:02.435
an alien.

56:03.680 --> 56:06.036
- Two aliens.
- Yeah.

56:07.080 --> 56:11.393
And they have my mom,
and I don't know where they are...

56:12.760 --> 56:16.276
and I don't know, maybe you...

56:16.360 --> 56:18.511
like, know something?

56:19.560 --> 56:21.791
What the fuck are you talking about?

56:21.960 --> 56:23.713
I know this is so much to unload on you,

56:23.800 --> 56:24.976
and I'm not blaming you or anything.

56:25.000 --> 56:26.496
- But it is definitely your fault.
- Hayley!

56:26.520 --> 56:28.336
What's your whole thing, man?
You think I'm an alien?

56:28.360 --> 56:30.016
I don't know.
That would make sense, right?

56:30.040 --> 56:32.953
- You leave town and come back different.
- Hayley, he's not an alien.

56:33.240 --> 56:35.709
You said it yourself at Dave's,
he's acting weird.

56:35.800 --> 56:36.816
- Hayley!
- What is she talking about?

56:36.840 --> 56:38.336
- No, I was just...
- Why are you defending him?

56:38.360 --> 56:40.636
- I thought you wanted my help.
- Oh, my God. Shut up!

56:45.160 --> 56:46.230
Hayley,

56:47.080 --> 56:50.960
can I please just
have a second with him?

57:36.400 --> 57:37.656
I don't know, Mother.

57:37.680 --> 57:40.115
You know, maybe,
maybe I like being single. Hmm?

57:40.200 --> 57:41.998
You ever consider that?

57:42.080 --> 57:44.151
After teaching all day,
all I want to do

57:44.280 --> 57:46.795
is just curl up with a book,
a glass of milk,

57:46.880 --> 57:50.191
and, and if I'm indulging,
yes, a cookie.

57:50.600 --> 57:52.114
Well, good for Florida.

57:52.200 --> 57:56.035
You know, but here, in the real world,
things are a little different.

57:56.200 --> 57:58.795
I mean, it's not like I'm just gonna
bump into the person

57:58.880 --> 58:00.456
- I'm gonna spend the rest...
- Oh!

58:00.480 --> 58:01.400
Uh!

58:01.401 --> 58:03.073
Oh, I... I am so sorry.

58:03.160 --> 58:04.958
- I will pay for this.
- Damn it.

58:12.800 --> 58:14.320
No pets allowed, young lady.

58:15.120 --> 58:17.476
That's not a pet.

58:20.920 --> 58:22.479
Oh, my God! No!

58:33.440 --> 58:37.753
Hayley's just, like, looking out for me.

58:37.840 --> 58:39.160
It's cool.

58:40.880 --> 58:42.394
Yeah. So...

58:43.960 --> 58:44.996
like...

58:46.360 --> 58:49.398
do you know anything?

58:49.480 --> 58:52.632
- No! Obviously!
- Yep.

59:16.160 --> 59:19.392
- What are you doing?
- I'm consoling you.

59:19.600 --> 59:21.876
No, seriously.
Something is going on with you.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.616
I'm just trying to be supportive!

59:24.601 --> 59:27.161
You need to tell me
what happened in Mexico.

59:27.240 --> 59:31.280
Nothing. I just chilled, poolside,
did that bullshit Spanish assignment,

59:31.440 --> 59:33.477
- sipped piña coladas.
- That's it?

59:40.560 --> 59:43.075
- What is that thing?
- It's a souvenir thing.

59:43.160 --> 59:45.994
It's nothing, okay?
You're just overreacting.

59:48.480 --> 59:51.393
I'm just trying to help.

59:52.960 --> 59:54.394
I know. I just...

59:55.160 --> 59:58.153
I wanted you to have answers.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.911
I'm going to get you some tissues.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:19.955
He's trying to help.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.400
That piece of shit. I knew it.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.136
You called him out on that thing,
and he freaked.

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.197
It's got to mean something.

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.396
Wow.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.239
You really heard everything, huh?

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.912
It was a really thin door.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.159
So, what do we do?

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:31.115
He mentioned
his summer homework, whatever.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.839
Right...

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.475
<i>Señorita</i> Thompson

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.640
so, he's allowed to make a video essay,
I don't know.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.958
Oh, so, maybe there's something
about that thing on his computer.

01:01:43.961 --> 01:01:45.953
Yeah. That's what I'm looking for.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:47.720
Yeah, no, I...

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.160
Yeah.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.279
Just get it together, bro.
Just gotta get out of Dodge.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.075

Yeah, there's nothing
in his dad's study, either.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.920
- Just a bunch of signed U2 posters.
- You couldn't leave it alone, could you?

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.800
Just, just needling him. Jesus!

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:52.672
What are we talking about right now?

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:56.595
My mom's out there somewhere
with fucking aliens, Hayley,

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.816
and you just scared off
our only chance of finding her.

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:00.115
Hold up. You're blaming me?

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.556
You kept going after him.
What did you expect to happen?

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:06.873
Sara, Skyler left because he couldn't
man up and take responsibility.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.314
But we'll figure this out, okay?

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.437
How? How do we fix this?

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.549
I don't know, but we can...

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.040
I don't know. We'll, we'll...

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.395
Skyler was the answer,

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:19.000
- and now, he's gone, and it's ruined.
- That's why...

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.920
Forget Skyler. We have made it this far
by ourselves, right?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.071
- We will find a solution.
- Oh, my God.

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.197
Are you, like, so naive

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:31.432
that you think we're just going
to go back to being best friends?

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.080
Is that why you've been trying
to break me and Skyler up?

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.431
So, you can, like, win me back?

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.752
What are you talking about?
This is insane!

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:41.991
I have spent this whole night
trying to help you!

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.198
And you love it, every second of it,

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.680
making me feel like shit.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.437
You really should
make better life choices."

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.113
Well, you should. Sorry.

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.675
You understand
this is why we're not friends, right?

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.656
We're not friends because
you ditched me sophomore year,

01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:57.909
when you got boobs before me.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.118
No, we're not friends
'cause you're a judgy bitch.

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.718
I'm going to be honest with you
because you can't do it for yourself.

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:08.874
If you were not so obsessed with
keeping your fake-ass world spinning

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.191
and had one ounce of self-respect,

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.816
this whole night
would've never happened,

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.040
and your mom wouldn't be dead.

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.760
I don't need this shit.

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.399
You found it.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:38.440
The...

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:40.791
Waiting on this idiot driver.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:47.272
It's locked, so...

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:54.037
My brother does, like,

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.873
tech stuff for
this home security company now.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.400
You think he'd help?

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:05.720
Okay.

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.435
Thanks.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.633
Car's outside.

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.671
Madre Vista Police Department.

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:25.118
Well, if it isn't the two biggest nerds
in Madre Vista.

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.115
You literally have tape on your glasses.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.078
Yeah, on the side. It's different.

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.470
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, okay.

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.393
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, okay.

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.596
- Idiot.
- Idiot.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.353
- Who's is it?
- Jerome.

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:44.510
My ex's.

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.680
Mmm-hmm.

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.193
Revenge.

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.871
Tell me about this dude.
He's your year?

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:55.037
Yeah, Skyler Cole.

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.976
Ugh. Sounds like a douche.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.559
- Water polo?
- Lacrosse.

01:07:58.840 --> 01:07:59.840
Hmm.

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.717
Are you hacking into it?

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.553
No, I'm guessing his password.

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:09.872
Usually, some combo of
"farts" and "boobs" and...

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.474
Yeah, "boobfart69."

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:14.596
Oh, shit. Okay.

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:17.279
Oh. Uh, wow. Whoa!

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:19.439
Oh, shit. Shit.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.200
That was pornography.

01:08:44.761 --> 01:08:46.161
Oh, my God.

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:50.154

<i>...tic, Mayan sword.

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:34.029

<i>to fight off their enemies,

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.551

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:54.200

I can't control it!</i>

<i>Give it to me!</i>

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.320
Wait.

<i>learning during the summer,

<i>of an expressive nature.</i>

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:34.151

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:36.200
<i>Most Mayans...</i>

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.192
<i>This is the most amazing art
I've ever seen.</i>

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.280
<i>...we have
several pieces here</i>

01:10:39.281 --> 01:10:41.273
<i>that were carved
in stone.</i>

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.320
<i>The Mayans were geniuses,</i>

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.918
<i>and this is in a museum.</i>

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.357
<i>I mean, the level of detail.</i>

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.515

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:03.755
<i>Okay...</i>

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.832
<i>That's okay.
That's okay...</i>

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.077
<i>Now, if you can
exit this way...</i>

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:22.031
Oh, my God.

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.439
Oh, Lord.

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:44.075
Psst!

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.555
Thank you. Thank you, Officer.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.871
- It's inside?
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:56.555
All right. That's okay.
Can you tell me what happened in there?

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.313
I mean, I hid until the...

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:01.120
I just...
I'm a little frazzled.

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:02.796
Okay.

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:03.956
Um...

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:07.192
Is there anything you want to tell me
before I go in there?

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:10.991
I'll never forget the screams.

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.230
Okay.

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.316
Okay.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.598
Oh, that's not great.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.155
What the hell is that?

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:41.833
I think this thing says
your baby boy is growing up.

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.120
Great.

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:47.816
- What's next, Skyler?
<i>- Go sit down.</i>

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.320
<i>Your mother
and I are not ready.</i>

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:54.280
Oh, another one.

01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:59.837
They're fighting each other?

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:01.200
Wait.

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:05.393
They're not fighting.

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:10.192
- They're...
- Fucking.

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.356
I...

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.353
I think it's a girl.

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:16.190
- She's gonna get...
- Pregnant.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.918
This is gonna spread.

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:21.237
But whoever drew these things
beat the thingies

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.596
because they were
alive at the end, right?

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:26.832
They made this IKEA manual
for how to win.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.799
If there's any more drawings...

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.200
Oh! There!

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.313
Don't love that.

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:46.440
No.

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:49.035
The female's turning into
a giant spider thingy,

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:52.272
and our only solution is to, like,
torch everything and kill everyone?

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.675
My mom doesn't stand a chance.

01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:00.431
The girl is turning into
a spider monster thingy.

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:02.955
If it's in its cocoon,
it's parked somewhere.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:05.191
And if we find the cocoon,
we find your mom.

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.351
And we just kill these thingies
before they F. Boom.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:11.349
Yeah, but how are we supposed to
find the cocoon?

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:13.829
Shit! Aah!

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:17.512
Damn it, that burned. That burned.
That burned, that burned.

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.394
Interesting.

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.836
Yes, it has, sir.
Thank you very much, Mr. Harrington.

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.520
So...

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:32.075
there have been a few alarms
that have gone off tonight.

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:35.034
Some around the clinic,
some around that farm,

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:36.998
and some at the police station.

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.073
- Told you.
- But...

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:42.236
there haven't been any
in the past few hours.

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:44.000
What the hell?

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:46.549
Is that normal for this time of night?

01:15:47.921 --> 01:15:50.197
Yeah. Totally. I mean...

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:53.036
- Yeah.
- What?

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.557
Nothing. Nothing.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:00.096
- What was it, you idiot?
- It's nothing!

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:02.536
There's just one place
that hasn't set their alarm at closing,

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:04.199
and they usually do.

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:39.136
Sorry, the store's closed.
Please just never call here again.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:40.230
Hello?

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.200
Hello?

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:44.159
- Oscar?
- Sara?

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:45.550
You're alive?

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:49.551
Yeah. You, too. Yay!

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:52.240
- Wait, is that the cop from the barn?
- Shut up, Jerome!

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:54.317
- Who's Jerome?
- It doesn't matter.

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.000
- Is my mom there?
- Is your mom there?

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:58.476
- Wait, what?
- She's not there with you?

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.109
Oh, no, she's, uh...

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:09.398
We'll take my car.
If we do this, we go hard.

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:11.720
I can't have you guys chickening out
at the last second.

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:14.835
Oh, you two little shits!

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:31.600
Just so you know, I wasn't gonna
shoot the propane. Bad idea.

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:34.559
I didn't even know that you were
in there, obviously, because the...

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:41.519
But it wouldn't have killed her.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:46.394
It wouldn't have killed her.

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:50.632
She's gonna be okay.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:30.949
What the hell?

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:02.794
No, I don't understand.

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:07.394
Those things are out there...

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:11.878
and they're gonna F, and we're screwed.

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:15.351
You work your whole life
to get into college,

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:16.999
and then the world just...

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:19.360
ends!

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.799
And it doesn't even matter.

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.998
Oh, my God.

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:28.833
I have never been to Japan.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.957
Holy shit!

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:37.036
What do these thingies need
to complete their life cycle?

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:39.754
<i>"High School Hottiez"?</i>

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:42.594
- They need people to F, right?
- Right.

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:45.798
Okay, so, we know they're
looking for sex. A lot of sex.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:47.000
They're out there right now,

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:49.874
sniffing around for pheromones
or gamma rays or whatever,

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:51.553
all leading to, like...

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:55.599
- An orgy?
- Yeah! Kind of.

01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.280
Where are we gonna find an orgy
in Madre Vista?

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:01.236
You mean like a big,
sweaty group of people,

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:02.834
ready to go to the bone zone?

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:05.880
Kiana's party!

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.436
There's a party?

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:08.640
Oh.

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:10.633
- Yeah. Sorry.
- No, it's cool.

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:12.616
But, oh, shit, Kiana's party.
That's gotta be it.

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:13.736
We don't have a lot of time.

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:14.976
If the whole party gets gassed,

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.913
we'll have 100 Skyler-level horndogs
making 200 thingies and...

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:19.710
Math will happen.

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:24.033
So, the plan is, get to Kiana's...

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.190
Evacuate the party.

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:27.040
- Take out the thingies.
- Stop the baby gas.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:30.238
- Save my mom.
- Save the world.

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:33.239
Shit, yeah.

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:19.320
Wait, wait, wait!

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:22.556
- What?
- One sec.

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.480
Your butt's kind of hanging out.

01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:31.920
Oh.

01:21:31.921 --> 01:21:32.957
Thanks.

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:40.830
- Shall we?
- Yup.

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.149
Okay.

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.069
Uh...

01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:58.960
Aliens!

01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:05.714
Aliens are coming!

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:09.876
Uh...

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:11.360
Cops!

01:22:11.361 --> 01:22:13.273
Cops! Yes!

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:16.558
Guys, guys, we gotta bail.
5-0 rolling up any minute.

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:17.680
No, they're not.

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:19.456
The neighbors have been
calling them all night,

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:20.680
but they haven't shown up yet.

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:23.111
Probably 'cause they're busy jerking it.

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:26.478
Cody, shut the fuck up!

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.597
Okay. All right, yeah,
they're not coming.

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:31.070
Because they're all dead!

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.475
Whoo!

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:34.795
No, just...

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.680
Everyone needs to get out of here.
Where's Kiana?

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.678
You idiot.

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.794
- Did you finish?
- How about knocking, asshole?

01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:56.314
- Sara?
- Did you finish?

01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.835
- I thought you weren't coming.
- I don't care, Kiana!

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:01.480
Skyler, did you finish?

01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:05.077
No, Sara, I didn't finish, all right,
so, can you get out?

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:07.710
Oh!

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.029
What the hell, Sara?

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:11.896
Okay, seriously,
everyone needs to get out of here...

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:14.389
What are you doing?
You're being a crazy person.

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:15.960
He doesn't like you, Kiana.

01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:17.696
He's just turning into
some kind of sex freak.

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:19.234
Come on, this energy is so right.

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:21.073
Let's just do it! In front of everyone!

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.880
You are all junked up
with alien sex gas, you idiot.

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:25.713
Hi. Who the fuck are you again?

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:26.800
She's with me.

01:23:28.081 --> 01:23:29.673
Forget about them. Kiana...

01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:32.559
I love you!

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:35.920
Fine!

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:39.200
Sara, babe, I'm sorry.

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:40.516
Let's just do it.

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:42.876
It'll be like old times.
In front of all of these people.

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:47.720
This is why we broke up
in the first place!

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:49.393
I'm sick of begging!

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:52.075
Somebody better fuck me right...

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:53.276
Oh!

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:56.750
Skyler!

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:00.471
Okay, truth bomb.

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:02.296
I had sex for the first time
the other night.

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:07.434
Okay, yeah, whatever!
The point is, I gave birth tonight.

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:09.955
Yeah!

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:13.112
And what I gave birth to
was fucking aliens.

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.993
100% not playing.

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.311
Okay? So, seriously,
everyone needs to clear out

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:20.595
because they are coming...

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:24.040
right...

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:27.320
now!

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:44.640
Ugh.

01:24:44.641 --> 01:24:46.359
Kiana.

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:48.272
Now, I'm gonna have to kick your ass.

01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:25.797
What's up, man?

01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:14.710
Whoa.

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:28.350
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.916
Just so you know,
I had no idea about Skyler,

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.151
and I really value our friendship.

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:43.839
I'm too high to move!

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:00.876
Whoa

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:13.074
Um...

01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:29.280
Hayley!

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.114
Hayley?

01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:44.634
So, what's our plan?

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:48.236
Save my mom, save the world.

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:51.874
You're not going by yourself.
You could die.

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:54.320
Maybe.

01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:58.792
But I'm the one who started all this.

01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:02.720
Sara!

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:55.480
Mom!

01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:57.200
Sara?

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:18.793
I'm so sorry, Mom.

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:22.556
Oh, Sear-bear, you have nothing
to be sorry about.

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.595
Uh...

01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.396
Uh...

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:38.080
Okay.

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:40.236
Let's just...

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:48.320
Okay, okay.

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:24.920
Oh, shit.

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:29.960
Oh, shit.

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:33.356
Aah!

01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:00.830
Aah.

01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:29.360
Plan B.

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:47.272
- 'Sup?
- 'Sup?

01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:06.873
I'm just saying,
you deserve a little more vacation.

01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:09.031
Okay, Daddy? Take a few days.

01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:11.032
Take a week even. I'll be fine.

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:12.315
Take a month.

01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:15.436
No, I know
you can't actually take a month.

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:19.280
My gymnastics career is ruined.

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.750
My mom is gonna be so angry.

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:27.634
Is it over?

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:30.394
Hey, hey. Is it over?

01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:32.000
Oh.

01:33:32.001 --> 01:33:33.673
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:35.638
Listen, uh, do you wanna go out with me?

01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:36.640
Yeah.

01:33:36.641 --> 01:33:38.075
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:40.256
I realize this is probably
an awkward time to be doing this.

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:43.557
Also, I crashed my car.
It's kind of hard to drive with one eye.

01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:45.755
So...

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:50.159
- This is what parties are like.
- Yeah.

01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:52.960
But the monsters are usually way bigger.
