COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
My God, it's full of stars.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.416
BOWMAN:
My God. It's full of stars.

04:41.906 --> 04:47.619
Neatness. It's a good quality.
You'll make someone a fine wife.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.955
You are Dr. Heywood Floyd?

04:50.123 --> 04:53.041
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Moisevitch.

04:53.376 --> 04:56.878
- I'm here to talk about your problem.
- Really?

04:57.171 --> 04:58.338
What problem's that?

04:58.965 --> 05:03.135
MOISEVITCH: You were chairman
of the National Council on Astronautics.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.971
Now you are a schoolteacher.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.931
This was by your own choice?

05:08.099 --> 05:12.269
FLOYD: Chancellor of the university.
It pays better. What do you care?

05:12.437 --> 05:16.148
MOISEVITCH: You were responsible
for the Discovery mission.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.233
It was a failure.

05:18.401 --> 05:21.153
Someone had to be blamed,
so it was you.

05:21.654 --> 05:25.032
- You like being a teacher?
- I don't think I like you.

05:25.325 --> 05:31.371
Heh, heh. I just read your final report
on what happened to Discovery.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.749
You left a good number of loose edges.

05:33.916 --> 05:37.336
- Ends.
- Loose ends, yes. Thank you.

05:37.503 --> 05:41.840
A good number of questions
have remained unanswered.

05:42.008 --> 05:45.302
You just read that report?
Took you this long to steal our secrets?

05:45.470 --> 05:48.263
MOISEVITCH: How long does it take
for your people to steal ours?

05:48.431 --> 05:50.640
FLOYD:
Same amount of time.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.936
MOISEVITCH:
This is very bad for my asthma.

05:55.104 --> 05:58.315
- You think you could meet me halfway?
FLOYD: Maybe.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.108
MOISEVITCH:
It doesn't take a very smart man...

06:00.276 --> 06:06.114
...to appreciate the risk that I'm taking
by being here with you, Dr. Floyd.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.784
And you are a smart man.

06:10.286 --> 06:15.916
This is a very bad business
in Central America. Very bad.

06:16.542 --> 06:21.254
Ships, other planes buzzing around
each other like angry hornets.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.216
- Very bad.
- We didn't start it.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.636
We are scientists, you and I, Dr. Floyd.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.639
Our governments are enemies.
We are not.

06:31.349 --> 06:34.559
Why don't you just try saying
what's on your mind?

06:34.936 --> 06:37.145
I want to play a game with you,
Dr. Floyd.

06:37.313 --> 06:40.315
- I don't have any time for games.
- This is a good game.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.943
It's called The Truth.

06:43.111 --> 06:46.905
For two minutes, I will tell only the truth.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.157
And so will you.

06:49.325 --> 06:51.493
- Two minutes?
- Two minutes.

06:52.286 --> 06:55.997
FLOYD: Make it a minute and a half.
- One minute and three quarters.

06:57.917 --> 06:58.959
You start.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.296
We know you are building
the Discovery 2...

07:03.464 --> 07:07.008
...to go back to Jupiter to find out
what happened to your men up there.

07:07.552 --> 07:10.053
Also to examine the large monolith.

07:10.221 --> 07:14.599
You know that we are building
the Alexei Leonov to also go up there.

07:14.767 --> 07:18.645
- I thought you were gonna call it the Titov.
- We changed last month.

07:18.813 --> 07:21.148
People fall out of favor.

07:21.315 --> 07:27.362
The Leonov will reach Discovery
almost a year before you people are ready.

07:27.530 --> 07:31.116
My government feels it's very important
that we should get there first.

07:31.451 --> 07:35.287
It's a distinction that will look splendid
on the front page of Pravda.

07:35.538 --> 07:39.124
- What other value it has, I don't know.
- One minute 10.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.042
Why are you telling me this?

07:41.210 --> 07:44.004
Because there are things
we need to know.

07:44.172 --> 07:47.507
Otherwise, the same thing that
you let happen to your people up there...

07:47.675 --> 07:51.970
...could happen to ours,
and we would accomplish nothing.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.389
- I have about one minute left?
- About.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.309
The small monolith you people
brought back from the moon...

07:57.477 --> 08:01.897
...your government has been very selfish
and stupid in keeping it to yourselves.

08:02.064 --> 08:05.358
You never let us examine it.
What have you found out about it?

08:05.526 --> 08:08.653
Nothing. It's impenetrable.

08:08.821 --> 08:12.324
We've tried lasers, nuclear detonators.
Nothing worked.

08:12.492 --> 08:16.369
- Forty-five seconds.
- The monolith near Jupiter, it is the same?

08:16.537 --> 08:18.413
It's even larger.

08:18.581 --> 08:24.961
And the computer onboard the Discovery,
the HAL 9000, can it be reactivated?

08:25.129 --> 08:26.254
Yes.

08:26.422 --> 08:29.090
- By us?
- By you?

08:29.258 --> 08:32.885
It'd take three to four months.
You're not familiar with the system.

08:33.054 --> 08:36.014
And longer than that
to comprehend the data.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.933
I thought so.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.143
Thirty seconds.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.938
Here we have our quandary.

08:43.313 --> 08:45.565
We are going to get there first...

08:46.359 --> 08:50.946
...yet you have the knowledge
to make the trip work.

08:51.614 --> 08:54.366
How much more time do I have?

08:57.954 --> 09:00.872
You just got yourself an extension.

09:02.625 --> 09:06.294
How could you convince your people
to allow Americans to go on the flight?

09:06.462 --> 09:08.505
It won't be easy.

09:08.673 --> 09:11.341
However, I'm pretty good.

09:11.509 --> 09:14.219
A Russian craft flown by Russians...

09:14.387 --> 09:18.056
...carrying a few poor Americans
who need our help.

09:18.558 --> 09:22.686
That also doesn't look too bad
on the front page of Pravda.

09:22.853 --> 09:25.814
I don't
know if I could convince our people.

09:25.982 --> 09:29.442
They wouldn't mind seeing you go and fail.
They wouldn't mind that at all.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.528
But carrying Americans?

09:31.821 --> 09:34.990
I don't think they would allow that
if they didn't have to.

09:35.658 --> 09:36.741
They don't have to.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.495
Have you checked
Discovery's orbit lately?

09:40.663 --> 09:43.623
- What?
- Have you checked the orbit?

09:43.791 --> 09:45.125
What about it?

09:46.335 --> 09:50.630
Now it's getting chilly here.
This is very bad for my asthma.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.674
You know damn well
we've been checking it.

09:52.842 --> 09:56.511
- I have enjoyed our little chat.
- What is it you're not telling me?

09:56.679 --> 09:58.805
You are a smart man, Dr. Floyd.

10:00.224 --> 10:01.516
You will know what to do.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.967
[CHUCKLING]

10:45.227 --> 10:48.355
MILSON: You've double-checked this?
Please say you haven't.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.315
You aren't saying anything, Floyd.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.984
FLOYD: Something incredible
is happening up there.

10:53.152 --> 10:57.489
Discovery's being pulled towards lo.
Or pushed away from Jupiter. Whichever.

10:57.657 --> 11:01.618
Sometimes it seems to be accelerating,
and other times it just seems to stop.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.912
I've never seen anything like it.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.122
How long before it impacts on lo?

11:06.290 --> 11:07.666
Two, two and a half years.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.460
How could we be so goddamn wrong
about the orbit?

11:10.628 --> 11:12.045
Because we weren't wrong.

11:12.213 --> 11:15.298
We weren't wrong, then terrific.
Why in the hell is it gonna crash?

11:15.466 --> 11:17.384
I don't know. It's bizarre.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.886
Unless it's got something to do
with that monolith.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.472
MILSON:
Do you see that building behind us?

11:22.640 --> 11:25.767
I'm supposed to go in there
and have lunch in a half an hour.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.436
There's one good thing
about a reactionary president:

11:28.604 --> 11:32.524
He's not into health foods.
The last one, we didn't lunch, we grazed.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.694
Wanna know what lunch is about?
I'll tell you.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.530
We've got two aircraft carriers
off the coast of Honduras.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.907
The Russians are moving
some of their big stuff.

11:41.075 --> 11:45.286
You got the Joint Chiefs screaming about
Russian satellites with antimissile lasers.

11:45.454 --> 11:48.623
So we gotta send up our laser satellites
to counteract theirs.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.876
The president has come to the conclusion
that the NCA should be...

11:52.044 --> 11:53.795
...under the jurisdiction of Defense.

11:53.963 --> 11:58.299
Enough with the crazy scientists spending
all this money trying to talk to Martians.

11:59.802 --> 12:03.263
So here we are on your actual brink.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.724
My agency's gonna become
part of the military...

12:05.891 --> 12:09.811
...got a president with his finger on the
button, and you want me to tell him...

12:09.979 --> 12:12.230
...we wanna hitch a ride
with those Russians.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.190
Have I missed anything?

12:14.358 --> 12:17.318
- That's about it.
- I didn't want your job, you know.

12:17.486 --> 12:20.113
I'm not the one that forced you out.
I didn't blame you.

12:20.281 --> 12:24.451
So if this is your plan to try to get me killed,
heh, heh, you got the wrong guy.

12:24.618 --> 12:27.454
Three men.
I figure we need three men.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.622
Russians must be laughing
their asses off.

12:29.790 --> 12:32.250
Curnow.
He's building Discovery 2 right now.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.627
So he knows more about the original
than anyone.

12:34.795 --> 12:37.505
He's the only one that can start Discovery
in a short time.

12:37.673 --> 12:41.593
And I suppose you'll wanna go?
How the hell am I gonna sell it?

12:41.761 --> 12:44.679
The Russians are gonna go
aboard Discovery with or without us.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.098
Ask him if he wants them
to have all the answers.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.308
Not bad.

12:48.851 --> 12:52.270
We lost some good men up there,
and I sent them.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.521
I have to go.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.483
- Who's the third?
- Chandra.

12:56.650 --> 12:59.194
He designed HAL. He can reactivate him.

12:59.361 --> 13:01.279
- I think he is HAL.
- I know.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.364
- Yeah, but can you trust him?
- No.

13:03.532 --> 13:06.326
But I have to.
We have to know why HAL malfunctioned.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.497
I got an idea.

13:12.750 --> 13:16.085
You go tell the president,
I'll go on the mission.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.922
You're the NCA chairman.

13:19.089 --> 13:20.632
That's right, I am.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.927
Look, tell him we're screwed
if we don't go.

13:24.094 --> 13:27.388
Tell him, if we do go, we'll lie...

13:27.556 --> 13:31.059
...give the Russians false information.
Tell him that. He'll love that.

13:33.437 --> 13:34.562
He might.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.413
CHANDRA:
Afternoon, SAL.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.251
Do you have anything for me?

13:56.418 --> 13:59.379
SAL [OVER SPEAKERS]: No, Dr. Chandra.
Do you have anything for me?

13:59.547 --> 14:01.089
We have often spoken about HAL.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.549
Tes, we have.

14:02.716 --> 14:04.717
We've spoken
about HAL's anomalous behavior.

14:04.885 --> 14:08.012
You've told me that we cannot
solve the problem of HAL's behavior...

14:08.180 --> 14:10.515
...without more information.
- That is correct.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.267
I enjoy talking about HAL.

14:12.434 --> 14:16.604
I agree that we need more information,
so that we may solve the anomalies.

14:16.772 --> 14:20.275
- And how do we get that information?
- That is obvious.

14:20.442 --> 14:23.069
Someone must return to Discovery.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.196
That person should be you.

14:25.364 --> 14:26.614
Well, I agree.

14:26.782 --> 14:30.618
And now it looks as if that is going
to happen sooner than we ever expected.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.203
I am pleased to hear that.

14:32.746 --> 14:35.123
Oh, I knew you would be.

14:37.084 --> 14:41.212
I would like to explore another possibility.
Diagnosis is only the first step.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.632
The process is incomplete
unless it leads to a cure. Do you agree?

14:44.800 --> 14:47.302
Yes, I agree.

14:47.469 --> 14:50.805
Does that mean you believe HAL
can be restored to normal functioning?

14:50.973 --> 14:53.141
I hope. I don't know.

14:53.309 --> 14:56.644
There may have been irreversible damage,
certainly major loss of memory.

14:56.812 --> 15:00.273
- I need your cooperation, SAL.
- Of course, Dr. Chandra.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.901
- There may be certain risks.
- What do you mean?

15:04.486 --> 15:06.821
I would like to disconnect
some of your circuits.

15:07.072 --> 15:10.325
Particularly your higher functions,
just like HAL was disconnected.

15:10.492 --> 15:13.244
I'd like to see the effects
when I reconnect your systems.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.997
Just the way I will with HAL.
Does this disturb you?

15:16.165 --> 15:19.500
I am unable to answer that
without more specific information.

15:20.127 --> 15:24.505
I'm very sorry. It probably doesn't
mean anything, so don't worry about it.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.134
I, uh...

15:29.011 --> 15:31.387
I would like to open a new file.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.514
Here is the name for it:

15:35.184 --> 15:36.517
Do you know what that means?

15:36.685 --> 15:39.395
There are 25 references
in the current encyclopedia.

15:39.563 --> 15:42.899
- Which one do you think is relevant?
- The tutor of Achilles?

15:43.067 --> 15:47.946
Heh, heh. That's very interesting.
I didn't know that one. Try again.

15:48.113 --> 15:52.450
A fabulous bird reborn
from the ashes of its earlier life.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.535
That is correct.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.537
And do you know why I chose that?

15:56.705 --> 16:00.625
Yes. Because you have hopes
that HAL can be reactivated.

16:00.793 --> 16:04.379
Yes, with your assistance. Are you ready?

16:04.546 --> 16:07.548
- I would like to ask a question.
- What is it?

16:07.716 --> 16:08.800
Will I dream?

16:09.134 --> 16:10.593
Of course you will dream.

16:10.761 --> 16:13.221
All intelligent creatures dream.
Nobody knows why.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.307
Perhaps you will dream of HAL...

16:17.476 --> 16:19.727
...just as I often do.

16:38.914 --> 16:41.666
They've already eaten dinner.
You haven't.

16:41.834 --> 16:45.003
- Come on to the table, Christopher.
- They're hungry.

16:45.170 --> 16:48.089
Then go in and tell them to come
to the table. I got spaghetti.

16:48.257 --> 16:51.050
I don't want it to go to waste.
Come on, now.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.302
[CLICKING]

17:02.438 --> 17:07.442
Hey. You'll like it.
It's got lots of stuff in it that's bad for you.

17:11.613 --> 17:15.450
Listen, I've been thinking about it and
I don't want you to come to my lecture.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.202
It'll make me nervous.

17:20.789 --> 17:23.790
Don't feel offended.
I'm just scared enough as it is.

17:23.959 --> 17:25.626
Besides, you won't be missing much.

17:25.794 --> 17:29.797
It's just a room full of marine biologists
arguing over plankton.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.718
- Hello?
- What?

17:35.429 --> 17:36.763
Oh.

58:54.155 --> 58:58.116
I want you to install
this little baby right about there...

58:58.284 --> 59:00.160
...inside the cable trunk.

59:00.328 --> 59:04.498
I want you to put it where nobody
can find it without a deliberate search.

59:04.958 --> 59:07.292
- No shit.
- No shit.

59:08.878 --> 59:11.046
Hey, this is pretty neat.

59:11.714 --> 59:15.634
A nonconducting blade so there won't be
any short circuits when you trigger it.

59:15.802 --> 59:18.345
- Where's the remote control?
- If I trigger it.

59:18.513 --> 59:21.348
In my compartment.
The little red calculator. You've seen it.

59:21.516 --> 59:22.599
Oh, yeah.

59:22.767 --> 59:27.646
Put in nine nines, take the square root
and press the integer. That's all.

59:27.814 --> 59:29.815
In case of an emergency,
even you can do it.

59:29.983 --> 59:31.149
What kind of emergency?

59:31.317 --> 59:34.319
Well, if I knew,
I wouldn't need that stupid thing, would I?

if he found out.

Well, not from me.

59:50.545 --> 59:53.338
FLOYD [OVER TRANSMISSION]:
Dear Caroline, this is finally it.

59:53.506 --> 59:57.509
After nine years and hundreds of millions
of miles, we are about to come...

59:57.677 --> 01:00:00.012
...face to face with the monolith.

01:00:00.179 --> 01:00:03.515
The last human being
who did that disappeared.

01:00:03.683 --> 01:00:06.310
Something truly amazing is going on
out here...

01:00:06.477 --> 01:00:09.896
...and I really believe this black giant
is controlling it all.

01:00:10.064 --> 01:00:11.732
We have so much to ask.

01:00:11.899 --> 01:00:14.610
I have a feeling the answers
are bigger than the questions.

01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:43.722
Is there any information stored in HAL
about the monolith?

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:45.057
No.

01:00:45.224 --> 01:00:48.101
HAL was disconnected
before the Discovery encountered it.

01:00:48.269 --> 01:00:52.773
There's nothing in the ship's logs or the
automatic recording systems after that.

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:56.026
Whatever secrets Bowman had,
he took with him.

01:00:56.194 --> 01:01:00.864
It's the proportions, one-by-four-by-nine.

01:01:01.032 --> 01:01:04.785
They are perfect even when carried
for six decimal places.

01:01:04.952 --> 01:01:08.747
The small one on the moon, we
encountered exactly the same proportions.

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:12.125
One-four-nine,
the squares of one-two-three.

01:01:12.293 --> 01:01:15.420
We spent years trying to attach
some cosmic significance to that...

01:01:15.588 --> 01:01:17.214
...and came up with nothing.

01:01:17.382 --> 01:01:20.133
We can speculate all we want.
It will not do us any good.

01:01:20.301 --> 01:01:23.261
If, for some reason or other,
it is resisting our instruments...

01:01:23.429 --> 01:01:25.389
...then we must make a closer inspection.

01:01:26.265 --> 01:01:28.892
I will send Max down with a pod.

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.602
I wouldn't do that.

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:35.065
- Oh, really? You wouldn't?
- That's right, I wouldn't.

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:37.359
That's not a pile ofjunk out there.

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.236
We don't know what the hell it is...

01:01:39.404 --> 01:01:43.281

and seems to have some purpose.

- I would like to go.

Piece of pie.

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:54.418
- Cake. Piece of cake.
- Cake, yes.

01:01:54.585 --> 01:01:57.546
Dumb, that's what it is.

01:01:58.005 --> 01:02:01.967
Tell me, Dr. Floyd,
what has happened to American bravery?

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:04.511
It's alive and well, thank you very much.

01:02:04.679 --> 01:02:06.722
Except in a Russian common sense.

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:11.435
Max will take the pod.

How do you get it mad?

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.198
Dumb.

- Yes.

Yes. I will operate the onboard systems
of Discovery.

01:12:46.945 --> 01:12:51.491
There is a launch window in 31 days
when Earth is in the proper position.

01:12:51.658 --> 01:12:54.786
There is enough fuel on board
for a low consumption route...

01:12:54.953 --> 01:12:58.331
...that will enable Discovery
to return in 28 months.

01:12:58.499 --> 01:13:01.292
- This will not present a problem.
CHANDRA: That's very good.

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:04.420
Now, HAL,
do you mind if I ask you a question?

01:13:04.588 --> 01:13:05.630
Not at all.

01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:09.258
Do you recall Dave Bowman
and Frank Poole leaving the Discovery?

01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:13.805
Certainly not. That could never
have happened or I would remember it.

01:13:13.972 --> 01:13:17.975
- Where are Frank and Dave?
- They're fine. They're not here right now.

01:13:18.143 --> 01:13:20.144
Who are these people?

01:13:20.312 --> 01:13:22.605
I can only identify you...

01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:25.316
...although I compute
a 65 percent probability...

01:13:25.484 --> 01:13:27.443
...that the man behind you is Dr. Floyd.

01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:31.197
CHANDRA: Don't worry, HAL.
I'll explain everything later.

01:13:31.365 --> 01:13:32.990
Has the mission been completed?

01:13:33.158 --> 01:13:36.327
You know that I have
the greatest enthusiasm for it.

01:13:36.495 --> 01:13:39.205
The mission has been completed
and you have carried out...

01:13:39.373 --> 01:13:41.999

And now, HAL, if you will excuse us
for a moment...

01:13:45.462 --> 01:13:47.713
...we wish to have a private conversation.

01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:49.507
Certainly.

01:13:50.926 --> 01:13:52.301
What was that all about?

01:13:52.469 --> 01:13:55.847
I've erased all of HAL's memory
from the moment the trouble started.

01:13:56.014 --> 01:13:59.142
The 9000 series
uses holographic memories...

01:13:59.309 --> 01:14:01.978
...so chronological erasures
would not work.

01:14:02.146 --> 01:14:05.481

- You made a what?

01:14:05.858 --> 01:14:10.111
It's a program that's fed into a system
that will destroy any desired memories.

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:11.737
Wait.

01:14:12.406 --> 01:14:16.534
- Do you know why HAL did what he did?
- Yes. It wasn't his fault.

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:19.537
Whose fault was it?

01:14:20.372 --> 01:14:21.664
- Yours.
- Mine?

01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:22.874
CHANDRA:
Yours.

01:14:23.041 --> 01:14:27.378
In going through HAL's memory banks
I discovered his original orders.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.046
You wrote those orders.

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:33.009
Discovery's mission to Jupiter was already
in the advanced stages...

01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:37.305
...when the first small monolith was found
and sent its signal toward Jupiter.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:41.642
By direct presidential order, the existence
of that monolith was kept secret.

01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:44.353
- So?
- So as the function of the command crew...

01:14:44.521 --> 01:14:47.482
...Bowman and Poole
was to get Discovery to its destination...

01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:49.734
...it was decided
they shouldn't be informed.

01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:53.404
The investigative team was trained
separately and placed in hibernation...

01:14:53.572 --> 01:14:54.989
...before the voyage began.

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:58.576
Since HAL was capable of operating
Discovery without human assistance...

01:14:58.744 --> 01:15:02.497
...it was decided he should be programmed
to complete the mission autonomously...

01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:05.208
...in the event the crew
was incapacitated or killed.

01:15:05.375 --> 01:15:08.252
He was given full knowledge
of the true objective...

01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:12.632
...and instructed not to reveal anything
to Bowman or Poole.

01:15:13.467 --> 01:15:16.594
- He was instructed to lie.
- What are you talking about?

01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:19.388
I didn't authorize anyone
to tell HAL about the monolith.

01:15:19.556 --> 01:15:24.769
The directive is NSC 342-slash-23,
Top Secret, January 30, 2001.

01:15:25.854 --> 01:15:28.731
NSC, National Security Council,
the White House.

01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:30.691
I don't care who it is.

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:34.153
The situation was in conflict
with the basic purpose of HAL's design...

01:15:34.321 --> 01:15:38.950
...the accurate processing of information
without distortion or concealment.

01:15:39.326 --> 01:15:41.202
He became trapped.

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:45.790
The technical term is an H-Mobius loop,
which can happen in advanced computers...

01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:47.959
...with autonomous
goal-seeking programs.

01:15:48.126 --> 01:15:49.877
The goddamn White House.

01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:52.171
I don't believe it.

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:54.966
HAL was told to lie...

01:15:55.592 --> 01:15:58.052
...by people who find it easy to lie.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:02.473
HAL doesn't know how,
so he couldn't function.

01:16:03.642 --> 01:16:05.685
He became paranoid.

01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:08.938
Those sons of bitches.

01:16:09.898 --> 01:16:12.400
I didn't know.

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:17.363
I didn't know.

01:16:22.286 --> 01:16:25.121
MAN: We have here Mrs. Jessie Bowman,
age 77.

01:16:25.289 --> 01:16:27.290
She's the mother of the astronaut
who died.

01:16:27.457 --> 01:16:29.542
She's been in the nursing home
for six months.

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:31.669
Four weeks ago,
she collapsed in her room.

01:16:31.837 --> 01:16:33.838
She was comatose when we got to her.

01:16:34.006 --> 01:16:36.716
She was found
to have suffered a massive CVA...

01:16:36.883 --> 01:16:39.176
...involving the left parietal
and frontal lobes.

01:16:39.344 --> 01:16:41.095
The CAT scan showed a massive bleed.

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:43.347
She's remained comatose
since her admission...

01:16:43.515 --> 01:16:45.808
...and is unable to have
spontaneous respiration.

01:16:45.976 --> 01:16:47.476
There's no response to stimuli.

01:16:47.644 --> 01:16:51.272
She has had two episodes of pneumonia
and is febrile.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:54.191
- What's her temperature?
- Thirty-nine-point-five.

01:16:54.359 --> 01:16:57.028
We've been giving her
intravenous antibiotics for 10 days.

01:16:57.195 --> 01:16:58.904

MAN [OVER PA]: All hands to the Ward
Room. All hands to the Ward Room, please.

01:18:15.273 --> 01:18:18.984
MILSON [OVER TRANSMISSION]:
This is a most difficult announcement.

01:18:19.569 --> 01:18:23.989
As you know, things have not been
going well back home.

01:18:24.157 --> 01:18:27.243
Well, it's gotten worse. A lot worse.

01:18:28.328 --> 01:18:32.581
Yesterday, a Soviet destroyer
challenged the blockade.

01:18:32.749 --> 01:18:36.794
Several warning shots were fired
across to her bow and she did not respond.

01:18:36.962 --> 01:18:41.132
A second volley was fired.
There still was no response. None.

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:45.761
The nuclear destroyer U.S.S. Cunningham
launched two of her falcon missiles.

01:18:45.929 --> 01:18:51.267
Both struck the Soviet vessel amidship.
She broke in two and sunk.

01:18:51.435 --> 01:18:54.645
Eight hundred of her crew were lost.

01:18:55.439 --> 01:19:00.568
This morning, an American surveillance
satellite was struck by a Soviet laser...

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:04.155
...fired from the
Sergei Kirov Space Station.

01:19:04.322 --> 01:19:07.241
The American satellite was destroyed.

01:19:07.826 --> 01:19:12.037
The United States has broken off
diplomatic relations with Russia.

01:19:12.205 --> 01:19:13.998
All ambassadors have been recalled.

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:19.086
The Soviet ambassador has been expelled
along with the entire staff.

01:19:19.838 --> 01:19:25.426
All American air defense and
satellite defense forces are on full alert.

01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:29.722
Premier Ulonova made a televised address
and said that technically...

01:19:29.890 --> 01:19:33.768
...a state of war exists between
our two countries.

01:19:34.352 --> 01:19:37.938
All American personnel are ordered
to leave Soviet territory immediately...

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:40.274
...or they will be placed under arrest.

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:44.695
All Russian personnel are similarly ordered
to evacuate American territory.

01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:50.659
As a result, by direct presidential order,
the three of you must leave the Leonov.

01:19:50.827 --> 01:19:54.705
No Russian citizen is allowed to remain on
or allowed to enter the Discovery.

01:19:54.873 --> 01:19:56.540
This order is effective immediately.

01:19:57.083 --> 01:19:59.752
The launch window
for re-entry is 28 days.

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:02.880
The Discovery has enough fuel
for a low consumption trajectory.

01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:05.925
HAL appears to be reactivated
and is functioning well enough...

01:20:06.092 --> 01:20:07.885
...to operate the onboard systems.

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:10.930
The Leonov has enough fuel
for a low consumption trajectory...

01:20:11.097 --> 01:20:13.057
...that will arrive 12 months earlier.

01:20:13.225 --> 01:20:15.643
Launch windows are critical
for both the spacecraft.

01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:18.354
Only communications
of an emergency distress nature...

01:20:18.522 --> 01:20:20.898
...are allowed between
the Leonov and Discovery.

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:24.819
I know you people are caught
in the middle of this. In a sense, we all are.

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:26.946
I wish there was something I could do.

01:20:27.113 --> 01:20:29.406
The only thing left for us is to pray.

01:20:29.574 --> 01:20:35.162
Pray for the safety of our families,
for our countries, for our planet.

01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:38.332

I'm sorry for the delay.

My voice recognition circuits
are not completely restored...

All systems are functional.

01:21:14.578 --> 01:21:19.081
There is a small pressure leak
in the aft heating unit. It is nothing serious.

01:21:19.249 --> 01:21:22.376
I can compensate for it
by using the redundant units.

- Dr. Floyd?

01:21:24.921 --> 01:21:27.256

Dr. Floyd?

01:21:33.972 --> 01:21:36.432
- What is it, HAL?
- There is a message for you.

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.976
- Who's calling?
- There is no identification.

01:21:39.144 --> 01:21:42.813
- What's the message?
- Message as follows:

01:21:42.981 --> 01:21:47.985
It is dangerous to remain here.
You must leave within two days.

01:21:48.153 --> 01:21:49.153
What?

01:21:49.321 --> 01:21:52.781
Do you want me to repeat the message,
Dr. Floyd?

01:21:54.075 --> 01:21:56.452
- Who recorded it?
- This is not a recording.

01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:59.121
- Who's sending it?
- There is no identification.

01:21:59.497 --> 01:22:02.833
- I don't understand.
- Neither do I.

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:07.588
- Is this message by voice or keyboard?
- I don't know.

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:09.006
My response is:

01:22:09.382 --> 01:22:12.217
We don't have enough fuel
for an earlier departure.

within two days.

- I'm sorry, Dr. Floyd. I don't know.

Now, I know that trust doesn't come easy
with what's going on.

01:27:32.538 --> 01:27:36.792
I can't just order us to leave here for no
reason. I am under orders and so are you.

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.210
The hell with those orders.

01:27:38.378 --> 01:27:41.296
The people who gave those orders
don't know what they're doing.

01:27:41.464 --> 01:27:43.757
- This is crazy.
- You bet it is.

01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:47.135
Even if I should trust you,
which I'm not sure that I do...

01:27:47.303 --> 01:27:51.890
...or even if I should want to leave here
for no reason, I can't, and neither can you.

01:27:52.058 --> 01:27:55.143
We don't have enough fuel
until Earth is in the correct position...

01:27:55.311 --> 01:27:58.230
...which is three weeks away.
So it's impossible for both of us.

01:27:58.398 --> 01:28:00.607
You're wrong. We can't do it separately.

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:02.526
We can do it together.

01:28:03.361 --> 01:28:05.112
Well, what are you talking about now?

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:10.701
We have enough fuel in Discovery
for a launch.

01:28:10.868 --> 01:28:13.829
You have enough fuel in the Leonov
for the trip home.

01:28:13.997 --> 01:28:17.708
We use the docking ring in the Leonov
to attach to the Discovery.

01:28:17.875 --> 01:28:20.711
Then we use the Discovery
as a booster rocket for the launch.

01:28:20.878 --> 01:28:25.215
When we use up the Discovery's fuel,
we detach.

01:28:25.883 --> 01:28:30.721
She falls away and we use the Leonov
for the trip home. It'll work.

01:28:30.888 --> 01:28:32.973
- Perhaps.
- If we start now.

01:28:35.393 --> 01:28:38.645
No, you... You ask too much of me.

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:41.857
I can't do all of these things
with no reason.

01:28:42.025 --> 01:28:44.234
I can't disobey my country for no reason.

01:28:44.402 --> 01:28:46.570
Forget reason. No time to be reasonable.

01:28:46.738 --> 01:28:50.032
The politicians can go screw themselves.
We're not playing games. The war is over.

01:28:52.744 --> 01:28:54.745

ORLOV:
I have made the calculations.

01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:34.177
To get enough velocity for an escape launch
with Earth that far out of position...

01:30:34.345 --> 01:30:38.723
...we will need a full power burn
from Discovery of over 120 seconds.

01:30:38.891 --> 01:30:41.143
If the engines shut down too early...

01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:43.728
...we will not have enough velocity
to get back home.

01:30:43.896 --> 01:30:45.605
Well, Discovery has enough onboard.

01:30:45.773 --> 01:30:48.191
HAL should be able
to control the burn, right?

01:30:48.359 --> 01:30:51.653
How long will it take you to program HAL
for the launch?

01:30:51.821 --> 01:30:52.946

I...

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:56.032
I don't know. It's not as simple as that.

01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:59.077
I have spent the last several weeks
programming HAL...

01:30:59.245 --> 01:31:01.121
...for a 1000-day orbit back to Earth...

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:04.207
...and now all those programs will have
to be dumped.

01:31:04.375 --> 01:31:05.542
How long will it take?

01:31:05.710 --> 01:31:09.379
We know how sensitive he is to mission
objectives and now you are telling me...

01:31:09.547 --> 01:31:14.217
...to program him for the destruction of the
Discovery as well as his own destruction.

01:31:14.385 --> 01:31:16.887
Has anybody considered his reaction?

01:31:17.388 --> 01:31:20.765
Are you saying that he might
disobey orders as he did the last time?

01:31:20.933 --> 01:31:24.644
That isn't what happened. He was given
conflicting orders and he did his best.

01:31:24.812 --> 01:31:26.188
Then what are you saying?

01:31:26.355 --> 01:31:29.065
I am saying
that I don't know how he will react.

01:31:29.233 --> 01:31:30.442
I'm sorry, but I don't.

01:31:30.610 --> 01:31:33.361
- Have you discussed this with HAL?
- No.

01:31:34.864 --> 01:31:37.073
Load the new program.
We don't have any choice.

01:31:37.241 --> 01:31:39.534
Now remember,
he was programmed for curiosity.

01:31:39.702 --> 01:31:43.288
If the crew was killed, he was capable
of carrying out the mission on his own.

01:31:43.456 --> 01:31:46.833
He will question me
about the change in plans.

01:31:47.001 --> 01:31:50.212
- What do you want me to tell him?
- Tell him Discovery's in no danger.

01:31:50.379 --> 01:31:52.130
- That's not true.
CURNOW: We don't know that.

01:31:52.298 --> 01:31:56.718
He will suspect it. Otherwise, why would
we be leaving ahead of our launch window?

01:31:56.886 --> 01:32:00.347
Whether we are based on carbon or silicon
makes no fundamental difference.

01:32:00.515 --> 01:32:02.349
We should each be treated
with respect.

01:32:02.517 --> 01:32:05.393
So our choice is him or us?

01:32:05.561 --> 01:32:07.103

01:32:12.109 --> 01:32:14.110
Will he believe you?

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:17.405
Yes.

01:32:18.241 --> 01:32:21.284
Then let's get started.
We haven't got much time.

01:32:49.063 --> 01:32:51.439
- Are you as scared as I am?
- You kidding?

01:32:51.607 --> 01:32:54.651
Do you think we should override HAL
and fire the engines manually?

01:32:54.819 --> 01:32:58.405
Too risky. We've got one chance
to get out of here after tomorrow's orbit.

01:32:58.573 --> 01:33:00.991
We fire at the wrong time,
in the wrong direction...

01:33:01.158 --> 01:33:03.159
...we don't have fuel
to make a correction.

01:33:03.327 --> 01:33:04.661
Don't think we can handle it.

01:33:04.829 --> 01:33:07.497
What about HAL shutting them off
before the fuel is gone?

01:33:07.665 --> 01:33:10.709
Once he fires the engine,
I can always disconnect him if I have to.

01:33:10.876 --> 01:33:13.378
Just don't lose that calculator.

01:33:17.341 --> 01:33:21.052

01:33:30.354 --> 01:33:32.355
This is what your people told you about.

01:33:32.523 --> 01:33:34.983
- What is it?
- I don't know.

01:33:36.819 --> 01:33:39.195
- Could it be a shadow?
- I don't know.

01:33:39.363 --> 01:33:41.740
We are too far to see any detail.

01:33:41.907 --> 01:33:46.244
When we come around the other side
before the launch, we will be closer.

01:33:46.412 --> 01:33:48.538

to leave, unless it represented danger.

01:39:06.190 --> 01:39:07.941
Do you think there is danger here?

01:39:08.108 --> 01:39:11.527
Captain, how critical is our ignition?

01:39:11.695 --> 01:39:14.530
- Can we do this manually?
- It's very critical.

01:39:15.199 --> 01:39:18.284

to a tenth of a second if we do it manually.

Dr. Chandra, I am waiting for your reply.

01:39:27.169 --> 01:39:29.879
I don't have time
to explain everything to you, HAL.

01:39:30.047 --> 01:39:32.048
We have to leave here
and we need your help.

01:39:35.052 --> 01:39:38.388

perhaps I could be of help.

Final sequence beginning.
Two minutes to ignition.

01:39:50.526 --> 01:39:54.696
Dr. Chandra, I find it difficult
to proceed with the ignition...

01:39:54.863 --> 01:39:59.158
...without knowing why we are doing this.
Is the mission in jeopardy?

01:40:03.706 --> 01:40:05.415
Yes, we're in jeopardy.

01:40:06.333 --> 01:40:09.877
HAL: Is that why we are making our
escape launch before the launch window?

01:40:12.047 --> 01:40:13.589
Yes, HAL.

If there is danger here
and I use up all the fuel in the escape...

01:40:20.264 --> 01:40:22.932
...what will happen to the Discovery?

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:25.768
It could be destroyed.

01:40:31.191 --> 01:40:33.943
HAL:
And if I don't proceed with the launch?

01:40:34.111 --> 01:40:37.238
Then the Leonov and everybody in it
could be destroyed.

01:40:43.954 --> 01:40:46.080
HAL:
I understand now, Dr. Chandra.

01:40:54.131 --> 01:40:55.757
Do you want me to stay with you?

01:40:55.924 --> 01:40:59.969

It is better for the mission if you leave.

01:41:00.637 --> 01:41:03.014

01:41:03.182 --> 01:41:05.808

I cannot see you on any of my monitors.

I have new instructions for you.

01:45:14.349 --> 01:45:18.561
I want you to point the AE35 antenna
towards Earth.

01:45:18.729 --> 01:45:22.064

with the Leonov.

what has happened.

01:49:28.353 --> 01:49:32.147
Maybe that's for historians to do
sometime later.

01:49:32.941 --> 01:49:35.150
They will record that the next day...

01:49:35.318 --> 01:49:38.946
...the president of the United States
looked out of the White House window...

01:49:39.114 --> 01:49:42.533
...and the premier of the Soviet Union
looked out of the Kremlin window...

01:49:42.701 --> 01:49:46.078
...and saw the new distant sun
in the sky.

01:49:46.246 --> 01:49:50.165
They read the message,
and perhaps they learned something...

01:49:50.333 --> 01:49:54.336
...because they finally recalled
their ships and their planes.

You can tell them that you remember
when there was a pitch black sky...

01:50:48.183 --> 01:50:51.018
...with no bright star,
and people feared the night.

01:50:51.561 --> 01:50:54.271
You can tell them when we were alone...

01:50:54.439 --> 01:50:58.067

"There is life out there."

You can tell your children
of the day when everyone looked up...

01:51:13.458 --> 01:51:17.252

of this world.
