00:03.000 --> 00:04.960
Previously...

00:04.960 --> 00:07.799
on Love Island...

00:07.800 --> 00:09.960
..emotions ran high.

00:09.960 --> 00:13.959
<font color="#FFFF00">She is probably a little more into</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">me than I'm into her.</font>

00:13.960 --> 00:15.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you want to tell me something</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that happened today</font>

00:15.960 --> 00:18.799
<font color="#00FFFF">that maybe you should have had the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">balls to tell me before?</font>

00:18.800 --> 00:20.799
<font color="#FFFF00">What you on about?</font>

00:20.800 --> 00:23.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Unless I feel 100% confident,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">then I'm not going to pick him</font>

00:23.480 --> 00:25.159
<font color="#00FFFF">if it comes to recoupling.</font>

00:25.160 --> 00:27.960
And the battle lines were drawn.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I expected him to be more subtle</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">about it.</font>

00:29.960 --> 00:32.800
<font color="#11FF11">It just felt a bit desperate to me.</font>

00:38.960 --> 00:40.960
Tonight...

00:43.960 --> 00:46.960
..the love games are heating up.

00:48.960 --> 00:52.639
<font color="#11FF11">These girls have feelings as well.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah.</font>

00:52.640 --> 00:55.960
<font color="#11FF11">I think the way that you've acted</font>
<font color="#11FF11">is just stupid.</font>

00:55.960 --> 00:57.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Survival of the fittest, maybe.</font>

01:17.320 --> 01:20.960
In the villa, the islanders
are all thinking the same thing:

01:20.960 --> 01:23.960
"I was sure we were doing the
recoupling on last night's show!

01:23.960 --> 01:25.319
Can we get on with it?!"

01:25.320 --> 01:27.960
And the answer is yes.

01:27.960 --> 01:29.960
(TEXT ALERT)

01:37.160 --> 01:41.160
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh! </font><font color="#11FF11"> Oh, my God!</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Here we go!</font>

01:51.960 --> 01:54.960
There's an equal number of boys and
girls so nobody's leaving tonight.

01:54.960 --> 01:56.799
But the girls are choosing

01:56.800 --> 01:58.960
and there are plenty of
relationships up in the air.

01:58.960 --> 02:03.960
So this could get very interesting.
Strap yourselves in, people!

02:08.960 --> 02:12.960
First up, it's Dani Dyer, who's been
with Jack from the beginning.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to couple up with this boy</font>

02:14.960 --> 02:16.960
<font color="#FFFF00">because from the moment</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I've got in here,</font>

02:16.960 --> 02:18.639
<font color="#FFFF00">you've made me laugh</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">every single day</font>

02:18.640 --> 02:20.960
<font color="#FFFF00">and you always manage to bring out</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the best in me.</font>

02:20.960 --> 02:23.479
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm so lucky to have met someone</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">like you so early on</font>

02:23.480 --> 02:26.799
<font color="#FFFF00">and I can't wait to have more</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">memories with you.</font>

02:26.800 --> 02:28.960
<font color="#FFFF00">And I do really fancy you in that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">silly little shirt!</font>

02:31.640 --> 02:33.960
<font color="#FFFF00">The boy I want to couple up with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is...</font>

02:35.960 --> 02:38.639
<font color="#FFFF00">Jack.</font>

02:38.640 --> 02:40.640
(APPLAUSE)

02:45.960 --> 02:50.960
Next up, it's Laura, who's been
coupled up with Wes since day one.

02:50.960 --> 02:51.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I'd like to couple up with this boy</font>

02:51.960 --> 02:55.960
<font color="#00FFFF">because I think he's amazingly</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">handsome</font>

02:57.960 --> 03:00.960
<font color="#00FFFF">and I genuinely look forward to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">waking up in the morning</font>

03:00.960 --> 03:02.960
<font color="#00FFFF">to him making me laugh.</font>

03:04.960 --> 03:06.960
<font color="#00FFFF">And most importantly, I think...</font>

03:06.960 --> 03:10.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I believe he is the nicest person</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I've ever met.</font>

03:14.960 --> 03:18.959
<font color="#00FFFF">The boy I would like to couple up</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with is...</font>

03:18.960 --> 03:20.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Wes.</font>

03:20.480 --> 03:22.480
(APPLAUSE)

03:25.960 --> 03:27.960
<font color="#00FFFF">That's OK.</font>

03:39.960 --> 03:43.159
Up next, is Hayley who's coupled up
with Eyal,

03:43.160 --> 03:45.960
but I'm guessing won't be
for much longer.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to couple up with this boy</font>

03:48.960 --> 03:53.960
<font color="#FFFF00">because I don't feel like we've had</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">much time to get to know each other.</font>

03:55.000 --> 03:59.960
<font color="#FFFF00">He's good-looking, I feel like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he's really made an effort with me</font>

03:59.960 --> 04:01.960
<font color="#FFFF00">since he's been in the villa.</font>

04:02.960 --> 04:05.320
<font color="#FFFF00">And I can just be myself around him.</font>

04:11.800 --> 04:14.960
<font color="#FFFF00">The boy I want to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">couple up with is...</font>

04:14.960 --> 04:16.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Charlie.</font>

04:16.959 --> 04:18.959
(APPLAUSE)

04:26.960 --> 04:30.960
Up next is Georgia, who coupled up
with Niall before he left the villa.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.960
Which boy will she pick tonight?

04:37.000 --> 04:40.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I want to couple up with this boy</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">because I think he's a right sort,</font>

04:40.960 --> 04:46.960
<font color="#00FFFF">a little bit edgy and he's made me</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">smile just when I needed it</font>

04:46.960 --> 04:50.960
<font color="#00FFFF">and I'm looking forward to spending</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">more time with him in the villa.</font>

04:53.960 --> 04:56.800
<font color="#00FFFF">So the boy I want to couple up</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with is...</font>

04:59.960 --> 05:01.960
<font color="#00FFFF">..Josh.</font>

05:02.960 --> 05:04.960
(APPLAUSE)

05:08.960 --> 05:10.960
Up next is newbie Megan.

05:10.960 --> 05:14.960
She had Eyal and Alex fighting
for her attention.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.960
So who will she pick tonight?

05:19.960 --> 05:22.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to couple up with this boy</font>

05:23.960 --> 05:27.960
<font color="#FFFF00">because he's made me feel really</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">comfortable since I've got here.</font>

05:27.960 --> 05:30.799
<font color="#FFFF00">He's really attractive.</font>

05:30.800 --> 05:32.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel like it hasn't been</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">an easy decision.</font>

05:35.480 --> 05:38.960
<font color="#FFFF00">But I'm looking forward to seeing</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">what happens in the future.</font>

05:43.960 --> 05:46.960
<font color="#FFFF00">So the boy I want to couple up</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with is...</font>

06:01.960 --> 06:03.159
<font color="#FFFF00">..Eyal.</font>

06:03.160 --> 06:05.160
(APPLAUSE)

06:16.960 --> 06:20.960
Up next is Samira. She's been
with Alex up until now.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.960
But will she stick with him tonight?

06:23.960 --> 06:26.799
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to couple up with this boy</font>

06:26.800 --> 06:29.959
<font color="#FFFF00">because he is super lovely,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">super friendly,</font>

06:29.960 --> 06:33.799
<font color="#FFFF00">confident, and everyone in the villa</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">absolutely adores him,</font>

06:33.800 --> 06:36.960
<font color="#FFFF00">and I know we have gone through</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a major rocky path,</font>

06:36.960 --> 06:39.960
<font color="#FFFF00">but we have come out with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">an amazing friendship</font>

06:39.960 --> 06:42.960
<font color="#FFFF00">and I hope we both find</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">our happy ending.</font>

06:42.960 --> 06:44.999
<font color="#FFFF00">So the boy I want to couple up</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with is...</font>

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
<font color="#FFFF00">Alex.</font>

06:49.960 --> 06:51.960
(APPLAUSE)

07:01.960 --> 07:03.960
Rosie, it's your turn to choose.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.960
I say "choose", you've got Adam.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.999
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to couple up with this boy</font>

07:13.000 --> 07:15.160
<font color="#FFFF00">because clearly</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he's the only one left.</font>

07:19.000 --> 07:22.960
<font color="#FFFF00">And I really hope he's going to take</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">this opportunity to make up to me</font>

07:22.960 --> 07:25.959
<font color="#FFFF00">everything he did and prove to me</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he can actually be trusted</font>

07:25.960 --> 07:29.320
<font color="#FFFF00">and therefore I can pick him on</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">my own accord next time.</font>

07:31.960 --> 07:35.960
<font color="#FFFF00">So the boy I want to couple up</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with is Adam.</font>

07:52.960 --> 07:57.960
<font color="#FFFF00">To be honest, he was the only one</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">left, what else was I going to do?</font>

07:57.960 --> 07:59.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I knew that, Adam knew that.</font>

08:00.960 --> 08:04.960
<font color="#FFFF00">He's got this opportunity. What he's</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">going to do with it is up to him</font>

08:04.960 --> 08:06.960
<font color="#FFFF00">but let's hope he proves himself.</font>

08:06.960 --> 08:08.799
<font color="#FFFF00">He's lucky to have it.</font>

08:08.800 --> 08:12.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I didn't have much of a choice!</font>

08:12.960 --> 08:19.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I mean, like, I think you would</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">have picked us anyway.</font>

08:19.960 --> 08:22.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Not in a cocky way, but in a way,</font>

08:22.960 --> 08:24.960
<font color="#00FFFF">like, I do think, like,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you are very loyal.</font>

08:24.960 --> 08:27.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I do like that a lot about you.</font>

08:27.960 --> 08:30.960
<font color="#FFFF00">You should have been loyal to me</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">first.</font>

08:30.960 --> 08:33.799
<font color="#00FFFF">I do want to make it up to you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and do all of those things</font>

08:33.799 --> 08:35.960
<font color="#00FFFF">and have another chance.</font>

08:35.960 --> 08:38.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I won't turn away and do anything</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">else or speak to anyone else,</font>

08:38.960 --> 08:42.479
<font color="#00FFFF">say anything about anyone else</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">about you which I wouldn't.</font>

08:42.480 --> 08:46.960
<font color="#00FFFF">That is judgemental.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">That is the main thing I did wrong</font>

08:46.960 --> 08:48.960
<font color="#00FFFF">and I do apologise for that.</font>

08:48.960 --> 08:52.960
<font color="#00FFFF">And I do think</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that I got a bit  scared</font>

08:52.960 --> 08:54.960
<font color="#00FFFF">of how fast things were moving.</font>

08:54.960 --> 08:58.960
<font color="#00FFFF">It was my fault, it wasn't</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">your fault at all.</font>

08:58.960 --> 08:59.999
<font color="#FFFF00">I know it wasn't my fault.</font>

09:00.000 --> 09:02.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I just wish you'd done the right</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">thing before.</font>

09:02.960 --> 09:04.960
<font color="#FFFF00">But we are who we are, right?</font>

09:04.960 --> 09:08.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I mean, fortunately for you,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you were the only one left.</font>

09:08.960 --> 09:12.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I just hope now that you do mean</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">what you said today</font>

09:12.960 --> 09:15.960
<font color="#FFFF00">and that we can move on from it.</font>

09:17.960 --> 09:20.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I will definitely,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">definitely redeem myself. I promise.</font>

09:20.960 --> 09:22.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah. I hope so.</font>

09:26.960 --> 09:29.159
<font color="#00FFFF">I think actions speak louder</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">than words</font>

09:29.160 --> 09:31.960
<font color="#00FFFF">and I think I've got a point</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to prove.</font>

09:31.960 --> 09:33.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I probably have to do a little bit</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">of ground work</font>

09:33.960 --> 09:36.960
<font color="#00FFFF">and win her back gradually over</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the next few days.</font>

09:36.960 --> 09:39.960
Megan had to decide between a man
who saves lives with his bare hands

09:39.960 --> 09:43.960
and a boy who can walk up and down
in a straight line while pouting.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.960
There was only ever going to be one
winner.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Did you have any idea, like,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">when I stood up?</font>

09:48.960 --> 09:51.960
<font color="#00FFFF">No, that is what I've been saying</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the whole day.</font>

09:51.960 --> 09:53.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I had no idea. Don't get me wrong,</font>

09:53.960 --> 09:56.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I know we've kissed</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and that was great,</font>

09:56.960 --> 10:00.999
<font color="#00FFFF">but I've seen you deliberating</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and I've seen you, like,</font>

10:01.000 --> 10:07.960
<font color="#00FFFF">chatting to Alex. I wanted to give</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you space for you to do you.</font>

10:08.960 --> 10:11.159
<font color="#FFFF00">Did you get worried when I was</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">talking to Alex today?</font>

10:11.160 --> 10:13.319
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, Of course. I was watching</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">everywhere you went.</font>

10:13.320 --> 10:15.960
<font color="#FFFF00">But it's awkward</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">when you are both there.</font>

10:15.960 --> 10:20.960
<font color="#00FFFF">At the same time,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I am here to make friends</font>

10:20.960 --> 10:23.479
<font color="#00FFFF">and I'm here to be with someone</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I want to be with.</font>

10:23.480 --> 10:27.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I am going to let him say his bit,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">but then I am coming in.</font>

10:27.960 --> 10:30.960
<font color="#FFFF00">(GIGGLES) "OK, that's enough, dude.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm coming over!"</font>

10:30.960 --> 10:35.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Now I know that you're interested</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">in me, then it's nice.</font>

10:35.960 --> 10:40.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Interested a little bit.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not getting ahead of myself.</font>

10:40.960 --> 10:45.959
<font color="#00FFFF">We can take it day by day,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">live in the moment.</font>

10:45.960 --> 10:46.960
<font color="#00FFFF">That is all I've ever wanted.</font>

10:46.960 --> 10:49.960
<font color="#00FFFF">But you seem like someone</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">who can do that. OK.</font>

10:58.510 --> 11:01.510
A pencil salesman from Swanley
called Jack

11:01.510 --> 11:03.510
is snuggled up in bed
with Dani Dyer.

11:03.510 --> 11:06.510
Now there's a sentence I never
thought I'd hear myself say.

11:06.510 --> 11:08.510
<font color="#FFFF00">You're such a sort, mate.</font>

11:08.510 --> 11:16.510
<font color="#FFFF00">You are a sort, mate. I've had such</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a laugh. What a squeeze. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Shut up.</font>

11:16.510 --> 11:18.549
<font color="#FFFF00">In her little two-piece orange set.</font>

11:18.550 --> 11:22.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Mate, no one can pull off two-piece</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">orange like me, babe.</font>

11:22.510 --> 11:23.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I know.</font>

11:23.510 --> 11:25.510
<font color="#00FFFF">You liked my speech, though, yeah?</font>

11:25.510 --> 11:28.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I really liked your speech.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It was lovely. It was nice to hear.</font>

11:28.510 --> 11:30.549
<font color="#FFFF00">You don't normally, like...</font>

11:30.550 --> 11:33.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Even though we are all happy</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">at the minute,</font>

11:33.510 --> 11:38.510
<font color="#FFFF00">you don't normally say to my face</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and that.</font>

11:38.510 --> 11:41.189
<font color="#00FFFF">I've said it. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Do you like me then?</font>

11:41.190 --> 11:43.190
<font color="#00FFFF">I do like you. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> A lot?</font>

11:44.510 --> 11:46.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Listen. Don't start getting excited.</font>

11:46.510 --> 11:48.510
<font color="#00FFFF">No, I do really like you.</font>

11:48.510 --> 11:50.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I promise you now,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm being serious.</font>

11:50.510 --> 11:52.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I could see something</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">happening with us.</font>

11:52.510 --> 11:55.510
<font color="#00FFFF">You are going to get far</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with that shirt anyway.</font>

11:55.510 --> 11:58.510
<font color="#FFFF00">You said you fancy me in this shirt.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Once.</font>

11:58.510 --> 12:01.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Don't start giving it the big 'un</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">saying you fancy me in the shirt</font>

12:01.510 --> 12:03.509
<font color="#FFFF00">and then telling me</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to get rid of  it.</font>

12:03.510 --> 12:05.510
<font color="#00FFFF">But I don't ever want</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to see it again.</font>

12:05.510 --> 12:08.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Listen, I knew this shirt would do</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the business.</font>

12:08.510 --> 12:10.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I knew I made the right choice</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">wearing this.</font>

12:10.510 --> 12:13.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, if she fancies me</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in this shirt,</font>

12:13.510 --> 12:15.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm sure she will probably fancy me</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in anything!</font>

12:15.510 --> 12:18.510
<font color="#00FFFF">You are all right, in't ya?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I think so.</font>

12:18.510 --> 12:21.189
<font color="#00FFFF">You've been nice to me lately.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I have been nice to you.</font>

12:21.190 --> 12:22.709
A pencil salesman from Swanley

12:22.710 --> 12:26.510
called Jack is now snogging the face
of Dani Dyer. God, I love my job.

12:26.510 --> 12:29.510
And it looks like Hayley is quite
taken by Charlie.

12:29.510 --> 12:32.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm happy.  Are you, though?</font>

12:32.510 --> 12:36.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, obviously. Otherwise</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I wouldn't have picked you.</font>

12:36.510 --> 12:39.510
<font color="#00FFFF">I could have easily picked</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">someone else!</font>

12:41.510 --> 12:43.869
<font color="#FFFF00">That is what I like about you.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You are a bit mad.</font>

12:43.870 --> 12:45.349
<font color="#00FFFF">(LAUGHS)</font>

12:45.350 --> 12:48.510
<font color="#00FFFF">If it was the other way around,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and you was in this situation,</font>

12:48.510 --> 12:51.510
<font color="#00FFFF">to pick who you recouple with...</font>

12:51.510 --> 12:53.510
<font color="#FFFF00">What, would I have picked you?</font>

12:53.510 --> 12:55.510
<font color="#00FFFF">..who would you have picked?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, you'll never know!</font>

12:57.510 --> 12:58.869
<font color="#00FFFF">You're bad.</font>

12:58.870 --> 13:02.709
<font color="#00FFFF">I feel like I've made the right</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">decision for me picking Charlie</font>

13:02.710 --> 13:06.510
<font color="#00FFFF">because I feel like I can be totally</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">myself around him</font>

13:06.510 --> 13:09.510
<font color="#00FFFF">which is important to me.</font>

13:12.510 --> 13:14.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Can we go to bed now?</font>

13:14.510 --> 13:17.189
In life, there's certain things
you should never do.

13:17.190 --> 13:19.510
Give out your bank details,
return to a lit firework,

13:19.510 --> 13:23.510
and above all, never get on the
wrong side of a Scottish lass.

13:23.510 --> 13:27.550
<font color="#FFFF00">Adam has literally been a bit</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of a prick since he's came in.</font>

13:32.030 --> 13:34.189
<font color="#FFFF00">He doesn't, in my eyes,</font>

13:34.190 --> 13:39.549
<font color="#FFFF00">really deserve the chance to have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">any beautiful girl pine after him.</font>

13:39.550 --> 13:43.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel like he probably went</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">through his whole life having that.</font>

13:43.510 --> 13:46.709
<font color="#FFFF00">And I just think it was a bit</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of an easy ride.</font>

13:46.710 --> 13:50.510
<font color="#00FFFF">I think Rosie is smitten. I think</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">she doesn't really like Adam.</font>

13:50.510 --> 13:54.510
<font color="#11FF11">Do not think if a boy thinks he can</font>
<font color="#11FF11">get away with that that easy,</font>

13:54.510 --> 13:57.510
<font color="#11FF11">it is only going to happen again.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">You need to put your foot down.</font>

13:57.510 --> 14:00.349
<font color="#FFFF00">Time will tell.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">He's going to do it  again.</font>

14:00.350 --> 14:02.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't think he treated</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Kendall right.</font>

14:02.510 --> 14:04.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't think he's treated Rosie</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">right.</font>

14:04.510 --> 14:07.510
<font color="#FFFF00">No one's going to respect him</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">if he treats girls this way.</font>

14:07.510 --> 14:10.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, this is what we all came here</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">not to find.</font>

14:10.510 --> 14:12.510
<font color="#FFFF00">We have all been through it before.</font>

14:12.510 --> 14:15.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Deep in my heart, I don't think</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">he's a nice person.</font>

14:15.510 --> 14:17.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Rosie really likes him,</font>

14:17.510 --> 14:22.349
<font color="#FFFF00">she's going to do all the mistakes</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">us girls do when we fancy a guy.</font>

14:22.350 --> 14:26.029
<font color="#FFFF00">I hope it works out and I hope</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he's learned his lesson,</font>

14:26.030 --> 14:28.510
<font color="#FFFF00">but I wouldn't hold my breath.</font>

14:31.510 --> 14:33.510
It has been a long night.

14:33.510 --> 14:36.510
No kidding, it started in part four
of yesterday's show!

14:36.510 --> 14:38.510
It is time for the islanders
to hit the hay.

14:38.510 --> 14:41.510
But not before the Buddha of Bushey
makes peace with Alex.

14:41.510 --> 14:43.510
<font color="#00FFFF">You all right, man?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yep.</font>

14:45.030 --> 14:48.029
<font color="#00FFFF">There's nothing more I can say.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You got the girl.</font>

14:48.030 --> 14:53.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, I did.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">But it wasn't to disrespect you.</font>

15:02.350 --> 15:05.510
<font color="#FFFF00">You look hot when you're angry.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Do I?</font>

15:05.510 --> 15:07.549
Adam's on his last chance
with Rosie AGAIN

15:07.550 --> 15:10.870
and our new couples are spending
their first night together.

15:37.350 --> 15:40.510
Still to come,
some food for thought.

15:40.510 --> 15:43.509
<font color="#FFFF00">Vile. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Disgusting.</font>

15:43.510 --> 15:45.350
<font color="#11FF11">I hated it.</font>

15:53.710 --> 15:57.709
It's the morning after the latest
recoupling and to be honest,

15:57.710 --> 16:01.510
it basically looks the same.

16:06.510 --> 16:08.550
Right you are, rise and shine.

16:11.510 --> 16:14.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Morning. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Piss off.</font>

16:17.510 --> 16:22.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Hola, senorita!</font>

16:22.510 --> 16:29.509
<font color="#00FFFF">We didn't go French, mate.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Kept it PG. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> We did, actually, PG.</font>

16:29.510 --> 16:40.349
<font color="#00FFFF">I had a little snog,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">but nothing  mad.</font>

16:40.350 --> 16:47.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Relax. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Poor Alex is feeling</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">miserable. Look at the bright side.</font>

16:52.030 --> 17:02.510
I just want you to realise that
Kendal and Rosie are really good
girls.

17:02.510 --> 17:05.510
They wouldn't pine after you.

17:05.510 --> 17:11.510
I just want you
to have a kick up the arse.

17:11.510 --> 17:19.509
You don't have to like everyone,
these girls have feelings as well.

17:19.510 --> 17:23.510
The way you act is just stupid
and you don't need to be like that.

17:23.510 --> 17:28.348
I am glad I told him.

17:28.349 --> 17:32.510
Boys are scared of me, to be
honest.

17:32.510 --> 17:36.510
She is really into you.

17:36.510 --> 17:41.869
she's a good girl, I don't want her
to look like she has had the piss
taken out of her.

17:41.870 --> 17:43.869
You know what I mean?

17:43.870 --> 17:51.510
She is going to be looking over
her shoulder.

17:51.510 --> 18:01.510
Your actions
are making girls insecure.

18:01.510 --> 18:08.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Laura did go in on us, little bit.</font>

18:08.510 --> 18:15.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to let it get it</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">off her chest.</font>

18:15.510 --> 18:22.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to let the girl crack on</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and tell us what she thinks.</font>

18:22.510 --> 18:30.510
Anyway, on a lighter note, Dani and
Georgia are talking about their boys.

18:30.510 --> 18:39.510
<font color="#FFFF00">It will be exciting</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to get to know him.</font>

18:44.350 --> 18:47.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to get to know him first.</font>

18:49.710 --> 18:54.029
<font color="#FFFF00">He  is older, which is nice. He's 26.</font>

18:54.030 --> 19:02.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, way older.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">He is definitely my  type.</font>

19:02.510 --> 19:07.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I look forward to the relationship</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">we could build.</font>

19:07.510 --> 19:16.510
# I'm gona wash that man
right out of my hair #

19:16.510 --> 19:22.510
<font color="#FFFF00">You look spicy already.</font>

19:22.510 --> 19:29.509
<font color="#FFFF00">Look at you, mate.</font>

19:29.510 --> 19:33.510
<font color="#FFFF00">You look handsome.</font>

19:33.510 --> 19:37.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Alex is a Doctor Love.</font>

19:37.510 --> 19:43.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I love him and I want him</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to meet a sexy nurse type thing.</font>

19:43.510 --> 19:48.510
<font color="#FFFF00">A bit reserved,</font>

19:48.510 --> 19:52.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I want him to find a bird here.</font>

19:52.510 --> 19:56.510
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not sure about that.</font>

19:56.510 --> 20:01.509
<font color="#FFFF00">Any bird would be lucky.</font>

20:01.510 --> 20:09.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I wouldn't even worry about that.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You are very good looking fella.</font>

20:09.510 --> 20:17.709
<font color="#00FFFF">The whole thing. I kissed her.</font>

20:17.710 --> 20:27.510
<font color="#00FFFF">I wouldn't do that to anyone else,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">it wasn't needed.</font>

20:27.510 --> 20:33.869
<font color="#00FFFF">I didn't know what was going on.</font>

20:33.870 --> 20:38.510
<font color="#00FFFF">I would never do that.</font>

20:38.510 --> 20:48.710
<font color="#FFFF00">This is the top level.</font>

20:50.510 --> 21:00.709
<font color="#00FFFF">He was saying that I look good,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and I should be confident.</font>

21:00.710 --> 21:08.510
<font color="#00FFFF">You need people like  that.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">He's a great guy.</font>

21:16.510 --> 21:18.029
There are two ways to keep fit.

21:18.030 --> 21:24.510
The gym and keeping up with your high
maintenance missus.

21:24.510 --> 21:33.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I'll do anything  you want later.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Anything?!</font>

21:37.510 --> 21:42.029
<font color="#FFFF00">I never thought that the boy would</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">be so nice to me.</font>

21:42.030 --> 21:50.510
<font color="#FFFF00">He's always saying,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">""Oh, my God, you're beautiful."</font>

21:50.510 --> 21:55.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you  think</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you made the right decision?</font>

21:55.510 --> 22:03.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, I don't now. It's tricky.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It's  early to tell.</font>

22:03.510 --> 22:06.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you fancy him.</font>

22:06.510 --> 22:11.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, but with Alex, he made me feel</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">much more reassured.</font>

22:11.510 --> 22:20.510
<font color="#FFFF00">It's not the same.</font>

22:20.510 --> 22:25.510
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't know want to pick.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't  want to overthink it.</font>

22:25.510 --> 22:36.510
<font color="#FFFF00">As soon as I picked Eyal</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and Alex was over there.</font>

22:36.510 --> 22:43.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I was doubting myself. He is really</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">good-looking, and a nice person.</font>

22:43.510 --> 22:49.349
<font color="#FFFF00">I am not going to tell him</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that I  fancy him a little bit.</font>

22:49.350 --> 22:51.189
<font color="#FFFF00">Because that's messing</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with his head.</font>

22:51.190 --> 22:54.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I just pray that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">no other girl will come in</font>

22:54.510 --> 22:57.510
<font color="#FFFF00">and gets Alex</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">if it doesn't work out.</font>

22:57.510 --> 23:04.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I know it's greedy,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but I'm not sure in my head.</font>

23:05.510 --> 23:11.510
So, Eyal Got the girl
and Megan has a dilemma.

23:32.550 --> 23:35.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I really want to, babe.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Hashtag,  mouth-to-mouth.</font>

23:40.510 --> 23:51.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I hate things like that. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I am</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">starving, I had a little lunch.</font>

23:54.510 --> 24:04.550
The old slow motion.
Two can play that game.

24:06.510 --> 24:14.510
The islanders must move the meal
from one side to the other,

24:14.510 --> 24:17.510
using only their mouths.

24:18.510 --> 24:21.510
The couple who does it first, wins.

24:26.510 --> 24:29.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Vile. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Disgusting.</font>

24:44.510 --> 24:48.510
<font color="#FFFF00">The soup was disgusting.</font>

24:51.510 --> 24:57.510
<font color="#00FFFF">I think we said earlier that we both</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">have big mouths.</font>

24:57.510 --> 25:01.510
<font color="#11FF11">And put Megan put her feet up</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and I did the paddling.</font>

25:08.510 --> 25:11.029
<font color="#FFFF00">It definitely wasn't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Lady And The Tramp.</font>

25:11.030 --> 25:14.029
<font color="#FFFF00">He had meatballs hanging</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">out of his mouth.</font>

25:14.030 --> 25:16.510
<font color="#00FFFF">The profiterols as well.</font>

25:30.510 --> 25:34.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Honestly, I didn't feel like I was</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">getting gonna be sick.</font>

25:34.510 --> 25:36.510
<font color="#00FFFF">It was my perfect meal.</font>

25:36.510 --> 25:44.189
<font color="#00FFFF">I loved everything. Champagne.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">And me.</font>

25:44.190 --> 25:46.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, my God!</font>

25:54.510 --> 25:59.510
<font color="#00FFFF">It was good fun.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I hated it.</font>

26:01.510 --> 26:05.870
<font color="#11FF11">I  absolutely detested it.</font>

26:08.190 --> 26:11.510
<font color="#FFFF00">It was light entertainment for me,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">anyway.</font>

26:15.510 --> 26:21.510
<font color="#00FFFF">We were determined, powerful, we</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">gave it everything. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I wanted to win.</font>

26:21.510 --> 26:23.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't care how disgusting it was.</font>

26:23.510 --> 26:27.510
<font color="#00FFFF">I felt like a pigeon,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">this is how I  felt.</font>

26:29.870 --> 26:38.349
<font color="#11FF11">We did all right.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">We finished!</font>

26:38.350 --> 26:40.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah!</font>

26:46.510 --> 26:53.510
<font color="#00FFFF">A bit salty.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Now, you're  sweating.</font>

26:54.510 --> 26:57.510
<font color="#FFFF00">The winner is, Wes and Laura.</font>

27:02.510 --> 27:04.549
<font color="#FFFF00">We had the ability from the start,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">we believe in ourselves.</font>

27:04.550 --> 27:13.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to thank my mum, dad, Laura,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Laura's parents.</font>

27:13.510 --> 27:15.510
<font color="#00FFFF">I am never doing that ever again.</font>

27:15.510 --> 27:18.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Ever!</font>

27:22.870 --> 27:26.349
Coming up...
it's confession time for Wes.

27:26.350 --> 27:27.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you a womaniser?</font>

27:38.510 --> 27:47.510
I've pulled some strings
and arranged a little chat.

27:47.510 --> 27:51.349
<font color="#FFFF00">It's just really awkward.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel like you hate me.</font>

27:51.350 --> 27:55.349
<font color="#FFFF00">I just wanted to apologise</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">about the whole kiss thing.</font>

27:55.350 --> 27:58.029
<font color="#FFFF00">It was a spur of the moment.</font>

27:58.030 --> 28:01.510
<font color="#FFFF00">It was disrespectful</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and insensitive.</font>

28:01.510 --> 28:03.510
<font color="#FFFF00">But literally</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it was, like, sitting there,</font>

28:03.510 --> 28:05.549
<font color="#FFFF00">and I was like,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">"Oh, I want to kiss you".</font>

28:05.550 --> 28:08.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I didn't know he was behind me.</font>

28:08.510 --> 28:12.510
<font color="#FFFF00">And then I looked</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and he was that close.</font>

28:12.510 --> 28:19.510
From my perspective,
he was laying it on pretty heavy.

28:19.510 --> 28:23.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't think</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he's that kind of person.</font>

28:23.510 --> 28:26.510
It just felt like that
at that time.

28:26.510 --> 28:28.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't want it to be awkward.</font>

28:28.510 --> 28:31.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I enjoy our conversations</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and hanging out with you.</font>

28:31.510 --> 28:34.510
Don't worry, it's all good.

28:34.510 --> 28:39.510
I need to spend some time thinking
about what I want to do from here.

28:39.510 --> 28:44.509
Did she make that choice
because of the way he was with her?

28:44.510 --> 28:47.510
It did make me think.

28:59.710 --> 29:01.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I've got a text!</font>

29:01.510 --> 29:03.709
<font color="#00FFFF">Text!</font>

29:03.710 --> 29:06.510
<font color="#FFFF00">It says...</font>

29:13.510 --> 29:14.710
<font color="#FFFF00">Aww!</font>

29:25.510 --> 29:31.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't really like sangria.</font>

29:34.510 --> 29:36.510
<font color="#FFFF00">That is so cute.</font>

29:36.510 --> 29:37.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, shit, I need to get ready.</font>

29:39.510 --> 29:43.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know what I am doing.</font>

29:49.350 --> 29:51.349
Do you feel nervous?

29:51.350 --> 29:52.510
<font color="#FFFF00">A bit, yes.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It is our first proper date.</font>

29:52.510 --> 29:57.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Other than shoving food</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">into each other's mouths. I don't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">think you can count that one.</font>

29:57.510 --> 29:59.869
Oh my God, I think
you are going to fall in love.

29:59.870 --> 30:01.709
<font color="#FFFF00">Shut up. </font> I think
you are going to fall in love.

30:01.710 --> 30:04.349
<font color="#FFFF00">How do we fall in love on a date?</font>

30:04.350 --> 30:07.029
You know it, though, don't you?
<font color="#FFFF00">No, I don't know anything.</font>

30:07.030 --> 30:09.510
# On the day we fell in love #

30:09.510 --> 30:12.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm really excited,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but I'm actually really nervous.</font>

30:12.510 --> 30:14.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know why.</font>

30:14.510 --> 30:16.869
It's actually really nice as well.

30:16.870 --> 30:20.350
<font color="#FFFF00">It is actually</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the most perfect night.</font>

30:29.350 --> 30:37.510
We got the church, she has the white
dress, I hope this date goes well.

30:37.510 --> 30:41.510
They have another wedding booked
at seven.

30:41.510 --> 30:43.510
It's nice, innit? It's all right.

30:43.510 --> 30:48.510
<font color="#FFFF00">You are so nervous,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you're shaking the table.</font>

30:48.510 --> 30:51.510
I'm not usually nervous
on first dates,

30:51.510 --> 30:54.510
but I guess it is a bit different
when you like someone, innit?

30:54.510 --> 30:58.030
Cheers to the first date of many.
<font color="#FFFF00">Lucky you.</font>

31:01.510 --> 31:03.510
<font color="#FFFF00">It is so nice here though, isn't it?</font>

31:03.510 --> 31:05.510
Yeah, it's amazing.
Such a good place.

31:05.510 --> 31:09.510
(CHURCH BELLS)
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh! That's so cute.</font>

31:09.510 --> 31:13.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Did you do that? </font> Well, I pulled a
few strings and that.

31:15.190 --> 31:19.349
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh. </font> It's nice to get to talk to you
away from everyone else.

31:19.350 --> 31:21.510
No distractions this time.

31:21.510 --> 31:26.349
<font color="#FFFF00">You need to explain your job</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a little bit more to me.</font>

31:26.350 --> 31:29.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Not that I am stupid, but,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it is interesting.</font>

31:29.510 --> 31:32.510
I cannot actually tell you
what I do on a day-to-day basis.

31:32.510 --> 31:34.869
<font color="#FFFF00">Why? </font> Because it's secret,
it's confidential.

31:34.870 --> 31:37.510
But what I essentially do,
is I do designs

31:37.510 --> 31:40.510
and then we go out
and implement them

31:40.510 --> 31:42.189
around different substations
around the UK

31:42.190 --> 31:44.510
doing integration systems
and electrical design.

31:44.510 --> 31:46.510
Yeah, it's dead simple.
It's like a DIY.

31:46.510 --> 31:50.189
<font color="#FFFF00">You could defo teach me to do that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in a day, yeah?</font>

31:50.190 --> 31:51.510
Of course I could, easy peasy.

31:51.510 --> 31:54.709
So what are you gonna do
when you come back,

31:54.710 --> 31:57.189
because obviously you were
in Dubai beforehand.

31:57.190 --> 32:01.189
<font color="#FFFF00">I have been there for ten years,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">so it is, like, a long time.</font>

32:01.190 --> 32:02.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you know what I mean?</font>

32:02.510 --> 32:05.509
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, I've had loads of jobs</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">since I was really young.</font>

32:05.510 --> 32:07.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I used to work in the tax office.</font>

32:07.510 --> 32:10.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Then I did</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a bit of glamour modelling.</font>

32:10.510 --> 32:14.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Is that an issue?</font>
It's not an issue at all.

32:14.510 --> 32:18.509
<font color="#FFFF00">What would your mum think?</font>

32:18.510 --> 32:19.510
<font color="#FFFF00">My dad didn't like it.</font>

32:19.510 --> 32:22.510
<font color="#FFFF00">No it was good. I will show the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">pictures,  if you like. </font> Fantastic.

32:22.510 --> 32:24.510
<font color="#FFFF00">You can keep them for your...</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Whatever.</font>

32:28.350 --> 32:33.349
I could never bring home
someone who did that.

32:33.350 --> 32:37.510
Meanwhile back in the house, Alex is
getting some advice from...

32:37.510 --> 32:38.510
Oh, my God.

32:38.510 --> 32:43.510
I don't know what to do now.
<font color="#FFFF00">Try it. Try it.</font>

32:43.510 --> 32:46.510
<font color="#FFFF00">There is no harm in trying it.</font>

32:46.510 --> 32:49.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Because you will get the feeling</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">straightaway.</font>

32:49.510 --> 32:52.510
I have morals about friends
and stuff like that.

32:52.510 --> 32:54.510
I feel like I'm stepping
on top of his toes.

32:54.510 --> 32:56.510
They have been coupled.

32:56.510 --> 33:00.510
Part of me thinks that they deserve
the opportunity to have a chance,

33:00.510 --> 33:02.510
you know what I mean?

33:02.510 --> 33:05.549
But at the same time, I don't think
he gave me the opportunity.

33:05.550 --> 33:09.510
Whenever I'm around, he's in there.

33:09.510 --> 33:12.349
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't think you've had a fair</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">shot.</font>

33:12.350 --> 33:17.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Whoever spoke to her,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">kissed her last...</font>

33:17.510 --> 33:20.510
<font color="#FFFF00">If you came over and kissed her</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">after that,</font>

33:20.510 --> 33:22.510
<font color="#FFFF00">would it then have been you?</font>

33:22.510 --> 33:24.510
He is such a good guy as a mate,

33:24.510 --> 33:27.510
but with a girl, I think there is
another side to him.

33:27.510 --> 33:33.549
Maybe I should be more ruthless.

33:33.550 --> 33:35.510
The conversation with Adam

33:35.510 --> 33:38.510
has definitely made me rethink
a little bit.

33:38.510 --> 33:40.510
It is a little bit
of food for thought.

33:40.510 --> 33:45.509
I possibly have to go
and speak to her.

33:45.510 --> 33:47.550
Was it genuinely the decision
she wanted to make?

33:48.550 --> 33:50.510
# And as the sun goes down

33:52.510 --> 33:54.510
# And the stars come out to play... #

33:54.510 --> 33:58.510
So obviously I came on Love
Island to find love.

34:00.350 --> 34:06.189
If I, we, whatever, did find that,
you know, it would be amazing.

34:06.190 --> 34:08.510
And I just think everything
will fall into place after.

34:08.510 --> 34:12.510
So I don't really know
where I am going to live, I guess.

34:12.510 --> 34:16.510
I am open.
<font color="#FFFF00">Live with me.</font>

34:16.510 --> 34:19.510
Do you live with your mum and dad,
though?

34:19.510 --> 34:21.349
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, I live with them at the moment,</font>

34:21.350 --> 34:23.510
<font color="#FFFF00">but I'm looking to move out</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">this year.</font>

34:23.510 --> 34:27.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't want to find a one bedroom</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on my own, we will see what happens.</font>

34:27.510 --> 34:30.510
<font color="#FFFF00">We will see in the future.</font>

34:30.510 --> 34:33.029
Say you have basically asked me
to move in with you already.

34:33.030 --> 34:35.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, easy.</font>
Done deal.

34:35.510 --> 34:37.510
You're keen.

34:37.510 --> 34:39.510
Oh, my God.

34:39.510 --> 34:42.188
<font color="#FFFF00">Where would you see yourself</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in five or ten years' time?</font>

34:42.190 --> 34:43.510
<font color="#FFFF00">What is the plan?</font>

34:43.510 --> 34:46.510
Do you really want to know?
I don't want to scare you. <font color="#FFFF00">Go on.</font>

34:46.510 --> 34:49.510
Like, I really want to have
a family, and stuff.

34:49.510 --> 34:52.510
But I would never pressure you
into...

34:52.510 --> 34:55.510
<font color="#FFFF00">No pressure because I want</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the exact same thing.</font>

34:55.510 --> 34:58.510
It can happen naturally in time.

34:58.510 --> 35:01.510
I'm not saying that my body clock
is ticking, but maybe it is.

35:01.510 --> 35:03.510
No, I'm joking.

35:03.510 --> 35:06.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm on the same page as you,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I think.</font>

35:06.510 --> 35:08.510
<font color="#FFFF00">The sooner you start thinking</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">about</font>

35:08.510 --> 35:10.510
<font color="#FFFF00">the more important things in life,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">then the better life you will have.</font>

35:10.510 --> 35:15.510
I swear, you are too good
to be true. <font color="#FFFF00">Oh, God.</font>

35:15.510 --> 35:17.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Why?</font>

35:17.510 --> 35:19.510
Are you, like, a womaniser?

35:22.510 --> 35:25.189
Oh, my God!

35:25.190 --> 35:27.710
<font color="#FFFF00">I wouldn't say...</font>
Check! Check, please!

35:29.350 --> 35:31.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I wouldn't say I'm a womaniser.</font>

35:31.510 --> 35:33.510
<font color="#FFFF00">My priority when I go out</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is to have a good time.</font>

35:33.510 --> 35:35.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Dancing and all that.</font>

35:35.510 --> 35:37.509
So you dance with all the girls?
<font color="#FFFF00">I just dance.</font>

35:37.510 --> 35:39.029
I will have to keep you
on a tight leash.

35:39.030 --> 35:41.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't mind being kept</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on your leash.</font>

35:41.510 --> 35:45.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Keep me on leash all day. Honestly.</font>

35:47.510 --> 35:50.189
The sangria has gone down a treat.
<font color="#FFFF00">We earned it.</font>

35:50.190 --> 35:52.509
We did earn it, teamwork.

35:52.510 --> 35:57.510
We just high-fived to the date.
<font color="#FFFF00">Christ.</font>

35:57.510 --> 35:59.510
Aw. Maybe you should kiss me then.

36:03.510 --> 36:05.510
# You're on my mind

36:07.510 --> 36:10.510
# You're on my mind #

36:14.190 --> 36:17.189
Coming up, the boys have a plan.

36:17.190 --> 36:19.510
What are we going to call it?
Operation...

36:19.510 --> 36:21.510
Operation Doctor Do More.
<font color="#FFFF00">There we go.</font>

36:30.190 --> 36:31.510
# Here comes the...

36:31.510 --> 36:34.510
No, they didn't do it, but
they are back from their dates.

36:34.510 --> 36:36.510
(CHEERING)

36:39.510 --> 36:44.510
<font color="#FFFF00">She has his jacket on!</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">ALL: Aw!</font>

36:44.510 --> 36:47.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Wes can't really do anything wrong</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">at the minute,</font>

36:47.510 --> 36:53.189
<font color="#00FFFF">he's such a nice guy</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and I really fancy him.</font>

36:53.190 --> 36:56.869
<font color="#00FFFF">He makes me smile and that's</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">all I'm really looking for.</font>

36:56.870 --> 37:01.510
<font color="#00FFFF">So, we got there</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and it was a massive church,</font>

37:01.510 --> 37:04.510
<font color="#00FFFF">I was literally like, "we</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">can get married here".</font>

37:04.510 --> 37:07.509
<font color="#FFFF00">Did you book it? (LAUGHTER)</font>

37:07.510 --> 37:10.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I had so many first dates. I am a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fucking serial dater.</font>

37:10.510 --> 37:12.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I take people on dates</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">all the fucking time.</font>

37:12.510 --> 37:16.510
<font color="#FFFF00">But, I was nervous for</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">this one. Like, nervous.</font>

37:16.510 --> 37:19.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Because it means something.</font>

37:19.510 --> 37:21.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Because it means something this</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">time.</font>

37:21.510 --> 37:23.510
<font color="#FFFF00">After this date, I found out so much</font>

37:23.510 --> 37:26.510
<font color="#FFFF00">about the girl, she's honestly</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">unbelievable.</font>

37:26.510 --> 37:30.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Proper... proper...</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">She makes me fall a bit.</font>

37:35.510 --> 37:38.509
Adam and Charlie have come up
with a brilliant plan.

37:38.510 --> 37:40.510
Find some wine to
put in their glasses.

37:40.510 --> 37:42.510
But first, a certain someone
needs help.

37:42.510 --> 37:44.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Alex?</font>

37:53.510 --> 37:56.510
<font color="#FFFF00">How is it going?</font>

37:56.510 --> 37:58.709
<font color="#00FFFF">Mate, listen up, right?</font>

37:58.710 --> 38:02.189
<font color="#00FFFF">Me and Charlie have realised Eyal</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">is getting in the way</font>

38:02.190 --> 38:03.510
<font color="#00FFFF">of you speaking to Megan.</font>

38:03.510 --> 38:05.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Me and Charlie are going</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to distract him,</font>

38:05.510 --> 38:09.869
<font color="#00FFFF">while you basically go and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to take the fucking lead now.</font>

38:09.870 --> 38:14.510
<font color="#00FFFF">We came up with a plan so Alex</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">has a fair shot with Megan.</font>

38:14.510 --> 38:17.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, that's fair. Weed to call it,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">what are we going to call it?</font>

38:17.510 --> 38:19.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Operation...</font>
Operation Doctor Do-More.

38:19.510 --> 38:21.510
<font color="#FFFF00">There we go.</font>

38:21.510 --> 38:24.510
<font color="#00FFFF">You need to call Megan</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">same time we are going to go</font>

38:24.510 --> 38:28.509
<font color="#00FFFF">and get Eyal and try to distract</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">him slightly.</font>

38:28.510 --> 38:29.709
<font color="#00FFFF">So you get a fair chance.</font>

38:29.710 --> 38:33.510
<font color="#00FFFF">I think a fair chance is fair</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">enough, right?</font>

38:33.510 --> 38:35.709
<font color="#00FFFF">No, no it's fair game.</font>

38:35.710 --> 38:39.510
<font color="#00FFFF">What happened last night, you can go</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and chat, while me and Charlie</font>

38:39.510 --> 38:43.510
<font color="#00FFFF">chat normally, as we</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">would about things.</font>

38:43.510 --> 38:48.549
<font color="#00FFFF">When we get Eyal,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you can pull Megan.</font>

38:48.550 --> 38:51.549
<font color="#FFFF00">I think people are really</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">rooting for me,</font>

38:51.550 --> 38:56.510
<font color="#FFFF00">and Adam and I have grown as a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">friendship,  as well.</font>

38:56.510 --> 38:58.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Kind of nice to have people going,</font>

38:58.510 --> 39:01.510
<font color="#FFFF00">"you know actually, Alex, you should</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">go for it and we will support you"</font>

39:01.510 --> 39:04.510
<font color="#FFFF00">kind of thing.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">How lucky am I really, you know?</font>

39:04.510 --> 39:06.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Because of everything that happened</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">last night,</font>

39:06.510 --> 39:12.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to hear from Megan what</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">happened, just for my own closure.</font>

39:12.510 --> 39:17.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Obviously, Eyal jumps in  and I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">haven't a chance to talk to  her.</font>

39:17.510 --> 39:22.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I just want to talk to her.</font>

39:22.510 --> 39:24.510
<font color="#11FF11">You are doing a boy plan.</font>

39:24.510 --> 39:26.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Eyal!</font>

39:26.510 --> 39:28.870
<font color="#11FF11">I'll be back.</font>

39:32.510 --> 39:34.510
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't know.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">What's the story?</font>

39:34.510 --> 39:37.510
<font color="#11FF11">We'll see. You alright?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm good, yeah.</font>

39:41.510 --> 39:44.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Meg, can I have a chat with you?</font>

39:47.510 --> 39:52.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, I've got my drink, I've got my</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fire,  I'm watching the show.</font>

39:53.870 --> 39:56.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Come and chill. How you doing?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, I'm good.</font>

39:56.510 --> 40:01.029
<font color="#00FFFF">Having a good day? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah, you?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Not too bad.</font>

40:01.030 --> 40:03.510
<font color="#11FF11">Do you know about stars and shit?</font>

40:03.510 --> 40:04.510
<font color="#11FF11">Why are they not enough</font>
<font color="#11FF11">stars in the sky?</font>

40:04.510 --> 40:07.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Because there's too much light</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">here for us to see stars.</font>

40:07.510 --> 40:10.510
<font color="#FFFF00">If we probably walked into that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">field we would see stars.</font>

40:10.510 --> 40:12.029
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you reckon here,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">if it was a clear night,</font>

40:12.030 --> 40:16.510
<font color="#00FFFF">we would see Orion's belt and that?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">No. </font><font color="#11FF11"> What's Orion's belt?</font>

40:16.510 --> 40:20.510
<font color="#00FFFF">It's a star.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">What's the other ones?</font>

40:20.510 --> 40:22.510
<font color="#11FF11">The North Star,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">is the brightest star.</font>

40:22.510 --> 40:25.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Is that over Newcastle?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">It's everywhere.</font>

40:25.510 --> 40:28.509
<font color="#FFFF00">That was probably a stupid question,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">wasn't it?</font>

40:28.510 --> 40:33.510
<font color="#00FFFF">So basically, I want to know</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">from you really</font>

40:33.510 --> 40:36.510
<font color="#00FFFF">with the whole Eyal situation,</font>

40:36.510 --> 40:39.510
<font color="#00FFFF">do you think it played</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">into your decision, at all?</font>

40:39.510 --> 40:42.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Because I understand from what you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">said to other people,</font>

40:42.510 --> 40:45.189
<font color="#00FFFF">your head was quite... you know,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you  were all over the place,</font>

40:45.190 --> 40:47.510
<font color="#00FFFF">a little bit about</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">what you wanted to do.</font>

40:47.510 --> 40:49.349
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, even between us.</font>

40:49.350 --> 40:52.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Even when I picked Eyal,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I was looking at you</font>

40:52.510 --> 40:55.510
<font color="#FFFF00">and I was like "have I made the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">wrong decision?"</font>

40:55.510 --> 41:00.510
<font color="#FFFF00">It hasn't been easy, and I felt that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">also, if I picked Eyal,</font>

41:00.510 --> 41:03.189
<font color="#FFFF00">he seems pretty chilled</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">about the whole process.</font>

41:03.190 --> 41:06.029
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you actually think that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with how he laid it on?</font>

41:06.030 --> 41:08.510
<font color="#00FFFF">I was pretty chilled.</font>

41:08.510 --> 41:12.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Who was the person who has already</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">panicked? Wasn't me, was it?</font>

41:12.510 --> 41:14.510
<font color="#FFFF00">No.</font>

41:14.510 --> 41:17.510
<font color="#11FF11">What's the maddest thing you've seen</font>
<font color="#11FF11">up there in space?</font>

41:17.510 --> 41:23.510
<font color="#FFFF00">A UFO.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Really?! A green one?</font>

41:23.510 --> 41:26.510
<font color="#00FFFF">I think there's a lot we have in</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">common.</font>

41:26.510 --> 41:28.510
<font color="#00FFFF">And, I fancy you,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I think you really  hot,</font>

41:28.510 --> 41:33.509
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not pressurising, I don't want</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to be  like the second best in a way.</font>

41:33.510 --> 41:35.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, that's why you didn't want you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to feel,</font>

41:35.510 --> 41:39.510
<font color="#FFFF00">when I voiced my concerns to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the girls, earlier I said,</font>

41:39.510 --> 41:42.509
<font color="#FFFF00">please don't tell him that I still</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">kind of like  him.</font>

41:42.510 --> 41:45.510
<font color="#00FFFF">They never told me that by the way,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that's not what's been said to me.</font>

41:45.510 --> 41:47.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I just said that.</font>

41:47.510 --> 41:51.510
<font color="#00FFFF">I didn't know that,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">but thanks for  telling me.</font>

41:51.510 --> 41:56.510
<font color="#FFFF00">It's not a thank you, it's more</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of a headfuck for you now.</font>

41:56.510 --> 41:58.510
<font color="#11FF11">Mate, you will love these.</font>

41:58.510 --> 42:04.030
<font color="#11FF11">Smell them. Smell my beads. Because</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I can't tell if my nose is blocked.</font>

42:06.510 --> 42:09.510
<font color="#00FFFF">That's fucking classic.</font>

42:09.510 --> 42:12.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Look, he's a great guy and a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">beautiful looking guy.</font>

42:12.510 --> 42:14.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I like his curly hair</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">just like you  do.</font>

42:14.510 --> 42:16.510
<font color="#FFFF00">But at the same time,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">did you  come here</font>

42:16.510 --> 42:18.189
<font color="#FFFF00">because you want your  usual type?</font>

42:18.190 --> 42:22.509
<font color="#00FFFF">No, I come here because I wanted to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">find love and find someone to go</font>

42:22.510 --> 42:24.510
<font color="#00FFFF">travelling with,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to do nice things  with.</font>

42:24.510 --> 42:28.510
<font color="#00FFFF">And with you, I know that you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">are on the same page.</font>

42:28.510 --> 42:30.510
<font color="#FFFF00">So, maybe you should think about...</font>

42:30.510 --> 42:34.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes, stressful.</font>

42:34.510 --> 42:38.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't want to put in pressure.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I didn't lay it on the line for you.</font>

42:38.510 --> 42:41.510
<font color="#00FFFF">You did you make me feel wanted</font>

42:41.510 --> 42:45.510
<font color="#00FFFF">and I knew you fancied me and that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">if I picked you, I'd feel secure.</font>

42:45.510 --> 42:49.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Whereas Eyal is a mystery.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">He plays it so cool.</font>

42:49.510 --> 42:51.189
<font color="#00FFFF">Does he like me or not?</font>

42:51.190 --> 42:53.510
<font color="#00FFFF">And that's what my parents</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">will be fuming about,</font>

42:53.510 --> 42:55.510
<font color="#00FFFF">because I always do the same</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">things.</font>

42:55.510 --> 43:00.510
<font color="#FFFF00">If you do the same actions</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and the results are the same.</font>

43:00.510 --> 43:05.549
<font color="#FFFF00">You need to change the action</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">if you  need a different result.</font>

43:05.550 --> 43:09.510
<font color="#FFFF00">See how it goes.</font>

43:09.510 --> 43:14.029
<font color="#FFFF00">At the end of the day,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you have  to go things.</font>

43:14.030 --> 43:16.189
<font color="#00FFFF">That's why I want to continue</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to get to know you.</font>

43:16.190 --> 43:19.510
<font color="#00FFFF">From my point of view.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">To see if it could be more.</font>

43:19.510 --> 43:21.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Hug. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> OK, cool.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Let's do that, shall we?</font>

43:21.510 --> 43:24.510
<font color="#FFFF00">You look amazing tonight,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">by the way. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> So do you.</font>

43:24.510 --> 43:28.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm loving the look.</font>

43:28.510 --> 43:30.510
<font color="#00FFFF">It's nice to chat to you.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, you too.</font>

43:30.510 --> 43:33.510
<font color="#00FFFF">I'll catch you in a bit.</font>

43:33.510 --> 43:35.510
<font color="#11FF11">I well need a wee.</font>

43:35.510 --> 43:38.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you getting another drink?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah, but I need the toilet.</font>

43:38.510 --> 43:42.510
<font color="#00FFFF">The villa is a beautiful place</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to be tonight.</font>

43:43.510 --> 43:46.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Mate, mission accomplished.</font>

43:46.510 --> 43:49.510
<font color="#11FF11">I don't know how me and Charlie</font>
<font color="#11FF11">pulled it off.</font>

43:49.510 --> 43:52.510
<font color="#11FF11">We were talking about all sorts.</font>

43:52.510 --> 43:55.510
<font color="#11FF11">So, mission accomplished now,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">it's back in this boy's hands.</font>

43:58.510 --> 44:03.510
<font color="#00FFFF">She missed out on a lot of stuff.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">What was happening?</font>

44:03.510 --> 44:06.510
<font color="#00FFFF">I will tell you.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">There's a lot to know.</font>

44:06.510 --> 44:09.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Has it gone on?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">We will see.</font>

44:16.510 --> 44:21.510
<font color="#11FF11">Take my hand. I think you look</font>
<font color="#11FF11">beautiful tonight, by the way.</font>

44:21.510 --> 44:24.510
<font color="#FFFF00">You're cute. </font><font color="#11FF11"> And I had a very fun</font>
<font color="#11FF11">day with you</font>

44:24.510 --> 44:27.510
<font color="#11FF11">and I feel like we crossed</font>
<font color="#11FF11">that little barrier.</font>

44:27.510 --> 44:30.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Adam and Charlie called Eyal.</font>

44:30.510 --> 44:34.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, yeah, so you could</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">speak to Megan. Sweet.</font>

44:34.510 --> 44:38.510
<font color="#00FFFF">So basically I said to her, I like</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you, I think you are attractive.</font>

44:38.510 --> 44:41.510
<font color="#00FFFF">We have something together.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">The way we connected.</font>

44:41.510 --> 44:44.510
<font color="#00FFFF">But we never had the chance</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to let that grow.</font>

44:44.510 --> 44:48.510
<font color="#FFFF00">I think that challenge helped to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">make things less awkward. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> 100%.</font>

44:48.510 --> 44:50.869
<font color="#FFFF00">Because you don't normally say much.</font>

44:50.870 --> 45:00.510
<font color="#00FFFF">And she was making like</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a lot of contacts, like that.</font>

45:02.510 --> 45:05.510
<font color="#11FF11">I felt like I like it was a little</font>
<font color="#11FF11">barrier crossed</font>

45:05.510 --> 45:08.510
<font color="#11FF11">and you look beautiful.</font>

45:08.510 --> 45:12.510
<font color="#FFFF00">Beautiful?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Beautiful, mate, yeah.</font>

45:12.510 --> 45:14.510
<font color="#FFFF00">(LAUGHING) Mate.</font>

45:14.510 --> 45:19.510
<font color="#00FFFF">You must feel good</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">about yourself, mate.</font>

45:19.510 --> 45:22.510
<font color="#11FF11">She has shown interest, you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">have everything to be happy about,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you should be happy.</font>

45:22.510 --> 45:23.510
<font color="#00FFFF">She said that she loved the way I </font>
<font color="#00FFFF">looked as well.</font>

45:23.510 --> 45:29.510
<font color="#11FF11">You look sick. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Thank you.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Fucking sick.</font>

45:56.870 --> 45:59.510
Tensions rise in the love triangle.

45:59.510 --> 46:01.549
<font color="#FFFF00">You're not letting me speak.</font>

46:01.550 --> 46:04.709
<font color="#FFFF00">You're not having a conversation,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you are just getting angry.</font>

46:04.710 --> 46:07.510
<font color="#00FFFF">Because I have always been honest</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and open with you.</font>

46:07.510 --> 46:09.510
<font color="#FFFF00">You trying to scare me off?</font>
