WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:37.470 --> 00:38.772
I'M JOHN OLIVER, THANK YOU SO

00:38.838 --> 00:44.544
MUCH FOR JOINING US.

00:44.611 --> 00:46.312
WE ARE BACK, AND SADLY, NO TIME

01:10.470 --> 01:12.772
OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS,

01:12.839 --> 01:13.640
CANADA'S CAPITAL HAS

01:13.706 --> 01:14.340
HAD ITS DOWNTOWN BESIEGED BY

01:14.407 --> 01:15.041
PROTESTORS.

01:15.108 --> 01:16.109
>> OTTAWA BECOMES A GLOBAL FRONT

01:16.176 --> 01:16.843

01:16.910 --> 01:20.380

01:21.548 --> 01:22.148

RIGHT THING HERE.

01:30.824 --> 01:31.090
>> John: OKAY.

01:31.157 --> 01:31.758
HERE'S THE THING ABOUT THAT,

01:31.825 --> 01:32.358
SOMETIMES, SITTING IN YOUR CAR

01:32.425 --> 01:33.026
IS "DOING THE RIGHT THING," LIKE

01:33.092 --> 01:33.593
IF YOU'RE WAITING FOR YOUR

01:33.660 --> 01:34.194

01:34.260 --> 01:34.694

01:34.761 --> 01:35.261
SCREAMING IN A TRADER JOE'S

01:35.328 --> 01:35.829
PARKING LOT BECAUSE THAT WAS

01:35.895 --> 01:36.429
SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR ONE HOUR

01:36.496 --> 01:37.030
ALONE AND YOU HAD TO SPEND IT

01:37.096 --> 01:37.864
GOING TO GET THAT FUCKING GLOVE

01:37.931 --> 01:42.502
EVEN THOUGH YOU ASKED BRENDAN

01:42.569 --> 01:43.236
THREE TIMES IF HE HAD IT BEFORE

01:43.303 --> 01:43.937
YOU LEFT THE HOUSE AND IF YOU

01:44.003 --> 01:44.471
DON'T JUST SIT HERE FOR A

01:44.537 --> 01:47.240
MINUTE, YOU MIGHT DO A MURDER.

01:47.307 --> 01:48.441
AND I WILL SAY, BROADLY, THERE

01:48.508 --> 01:49.742
IS NOTHING WRONG WITH CIVIL

01:49.809 --> 01:50.410
DISOBEDIENCE.

01:50.477 --> 01:51.578
IT'S OFTEN THE MOST POWERFUL WAY

01:51.644 --> 01:52.345
TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE.

01:52.412 --> 01:54.280
BUT OCCUPYING A CAPITAL CITY

01:54.347 --> 01:55.648
FOR NEARLY A MONTH OVER

01:55.715 --> 01:56.649
OBJECTIONS TO VACCINE MANDATES

01:56.716 --> 01:58.585
FOR TRUCKERS -- ESPECIALLY WHEN

01:58.651 --> 02:00.520

02:00.587 --> 02:02.422
ALLIANCE AND ONTARIO TRUCKING

02:02.489 --> 02:04.057
ASSOCIATION HAVE DISAVOWED THE

02:04.123 --> 02:06.259
PROTESTS, AND ROUGHLY 90% OF

02:06.326 --> 02:06.993
TRUCK DRIVERS HAVE RECEIVED

02:07.060 --> 02:08.628
THEIR VACCINES -- FEELS AT BEST

02:08.695 --> 02:10.663
AN OVER-RESPONSE.

02:10.730 --> 02:12.098
AND IT SURE SEEMS LIKE THERE'S

02:12.165 --> 02:13.933
MORE GOING ON HERE, BECAUSE THE

02:14.000 --> 02:14.567
PROTESTORS ARE NOW DEMANDING AN

02:14.634 --> 02:15.735
END TO ALL COVID RESTRICTIONS

02:15.802 --> 02:16.569
NATIONWIDE AND THE RESIGNATION

02:18.872 --> 02:19.873
JUSTIN TRUDEAU.

02:19.939 --> 02:21.140

02:21.207 --> 02:22.075
U.S. CONSERVATIVES, WITH FOX

02:22.141 --> 02:23.409

02:39.259 --> 02:39.759

02:45.398 --> 02:46.933
HAS BEEN A LEADER WITHIN THE

02:47.000 --> 02:49.402
"WEXIT" MOVEMENT -- WHICH, I

02:49.469 --> 02:50.136
KNOW, SOUNDS LIKE THE OFFICIAL

02:50.203 --> 02:50.870

02:52.171 --> 02:52.972

02:53.039 --> 02:55.708
OVERLOOKED -- BUT ACTUALLY

02:55.775 --> 02:57.277

ACKNOWLEDGE,

04:31.604 --> 04:32.071
"STRONGEST BLOODLINE" IS A

ME, LAURA, THAT'S NICE.

06:54.947 --> 06:57.116
>> THAT IS, ISN'T IT?

06:57.183 --> 06:58.751
>> YEAH, I LIKE IT.

06:58.818 --> 06:59.685
OKAY.

06:59.752 --> 07:02.789
PEOPLE AT HOME LIKE IT AS WELL.

07:02.855 --> 07:04.257
>> John: MOVING ON.

07:04.323 --> 07:05.458
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

07:05.525 --> 07:06.559
SCHOOL.

07:06.626 --> 07:08.194
IT'S THE ONLY SETTING IN WHICH A

07:08.261 --> 07:10.763
CHILD DISSECTING A FROG IS NOT

07:10.830 --> 07:13.599
AN IMMEDIATE RED FLAG.

07:13.666 --> 07:14.600
WE TEACH KIDS A LOT IN SCHOOL,

07:14.667 --> 07:15.701
FROM READING TO LONG DIVISION TO

07:15.768 --> 07:16.636
HOW TO PLAY THE FUCKING RECORDER

07:16.702 --> 07:18.004
FOR SOME REASON.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.172
BUT RECENTLY, THERE'S BEEN A LOT

07:19.238 --> 07:20.273
OF CONCERN OVER ONE PARTICULAR

07:20.339 --> 07:21.274
THING THAT PEOPLE WORRY THAT

07:21.340 --> 07:23.376
KIDS ARE LEARNING.

07:23.442 --> 07:24.243
>> CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS BEING

07:24.310 --> 07:27.346
TAUGHT IN OUR SCHOOLS.

07:27.413 --> 07:28.981
CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS BUNK.

07:29.048 --> 07:30.116
>> CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS A

07:30.183 --> 07:31.784
LIE.

07:31.851 --> 07:32.819
FROM THE FIRST WORD TO THE LAST.

07:32.885 --> 07:33.986
FROM START TO FINISH.

07:34.053 --> 07:35.488
>> RACIST CRITICAL RACE THEORY.

07:35.555 --> 07:36.556
>> CRITICAL RACE THEORY.

07:36.622 --> 07:37.924
>> CRITICAL RACE THEORY IN THE

07:37.990 --> 07:40.092
SCHOOLS AND THE WOKENESS.

07:40.159 --> 07:42.228
>> LET ME TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,

07:42.295 --> 07:44.230
CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS BIGOTED,

07:44.297 --> 07:45.598
IT IS A LIE, AND IT IS EVERY BIT

07:45.665 --> 07:47.567
AS RACIST AS THE KLANSMEN IN

07:47.633 --> 07:49.335
WHITE SHEETS.

07:49.402 --> 07:52.104
>> John: I DO NOT LIKE THAT

07:52.171 --> 07:52.772
TED CRUZ MAN.

07:52.839 --> 07:54.040
I DO NOT LIKE HIM SHOUTING

07:54.106 --> 07:54.807
"KLAN."

07:54.874 --> 07:56.242
I DO NOT LIKE HIM IN A ROOM.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.111
I DO NOT LIKE HIM IN CANCUN.

07:59.178 --> 08:00.746
I DO NOT LIKE HIM PLAYING BALL.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.015
I DO NOT LIKE HIS FACE AT ALL.

08:03.082 --> 08:04.483
I WISH HE'D LOSE HIS CUSHY JOB.

08:04.550 --> 08:07.887
THAT MAN TED CRUZ IS A FUCKING

08:07.954 --> 08:08.988
KNOB.

08:09.055 --> 08:13.392
BUT HERE'S THE THING, IT IS

08:13.459 --> 08:13.993
TRUE, YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD

08:14.060 --> 08:14.627
PEOPLE YELLING ABOUT CRITICAL

08:14.694 --> 08:15.661
RACE THEORY ON TV FOR MORE THAN

08:15.728 --> 08:16.462
A YEAR NOW.

08:16.529 --> 08:18.064
AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LISTENING

08:18.130 --> 08:18.764
TO THAT NOISE, ESPECIALLY

08:18.831 --> 08:19.599
JUDGING BY WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING

08:19.665 --> 08:20.833
AT SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS ACROSS

08:20.900 --> 08:22.034
THE COUNTRY.

08:22.101 --> 08:26.005
[PEOPLE SHOUTING]

08:26.072 --> 08:28.875
>> THE WESTERN CULTURE THAT

08:28.941 --> 08:29.642
BROUGHT FORTH CHRISTIANITY AND

08:29.709 --> 08:30.543
THE FOUNDING DOCUMENTS ARE BEING

08:30.610 --> 08:32.511
CALLED EVIL AND RACIST.

08:32.578 --> 08:33.779
>> I AM NOT CO-PARENTING WITH

08:33.846 --> 08:34.647
THE GOVERNMENT.

08:34.714 --> 08:36.082
IT IS NOT YOUR JOB TO FORCE

08:36.148 --> 08:38.050
THESE IDEAS ONTO MY CHILD.

08:38.117 --> 08:39.085
>> THE NARRATIVE IN THIS COUNTRY

08:39.151 --> 08:40.286
IS THAT WE'RE ALL INHERENTLY

08:40.353 --> 08:41.287
RACIST, AND I'M ABOUT SICK OF

08:41.354 --> 08:42.255
IT.

08:42.321 --> 08:43.823
>> IT'S A MARXIST IDEOLOGY AND

08:43.890 --> 08:45.224
WE ALL KNOW IT.

08:45.291 --> 08:46.759
>> ALL OF THESE LESSONS HAVE THE

08:46.826 --> 08:47.727
INTENT TO MAKE OUR CHILDREN FEEL

08:47.793 --> 08:49.362
DISGUST TOWARDS OUR NATION.

08:49.428 --> 08:50.296
>> THIS COUNTRY ISN'T EVEN A

08:50.363 --> 08:52.899
RACIST COUNTRY.

08:52.965 --> 08:54.600
WE ELECTED OBAMA FOR TWO TERMS.

08:54.667 --> 08:57.570
>> John: WAIT, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

08:57.637 --> 08:58.337
AMERICA CAN'T BE RACIST BECAUSE

08:58.404 --> 09:01.607
OF OBAMA?

09:01.674 --> 09:02.742
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER THE

09:02.808 --> 09:03.476
2008 ELECTION, BUT THINGS GOT

09:03.542 --> 09:04.377
PRETTY RACIST BACK THEN.

09:04.443 --> 09:05.878
PEOPLE KEPT SAYING HE WAS BORN

09:05.945 --> 09:07.914
IN KENYA, PEOPLE SAID HE WAS A

09:07.980 --> 09:08.514
SECRET MUSLIM, AND THEN A FEW

09:08.581 --> 09:09.749
YEARS LATER, WE ELECTED THAT

09:09.815 --> 09:12.852
PEOPLE PRESIDENT.

09:12.919 --> 09:13.586
SO LET'S JUST AGREE TO DISAGREE

09:13.653 --> 09:15.755
ON THAT ONE, SHALL WE?

09:15.821 --> 09:17.890
THAT FIRST MEETING WAS IN

09:17.957 --> 09:20.192
LOUDOUN COUNTY, VIRGINIA, AND

09:20.259 --> 09:21.027
THE MEETING GOT SO OUT OF HAND

09:21.093 --> 09:27.667
THAT IT WAS SHUT DOWN EARLY, AND

09:27.733 --> 09:28.401
AN GUY WAS ARRESTED

09:28.467 --> 09:29.101
FOR TRESPASSING, ONLY TO POP UP

09:29.168 --> 09:29.669
ON "TUCKER CARLSON" THE VERY

09:29.735 --> 09:30.336
NEXT DAY.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.070
SO CLEARLY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

09:31.137 --> 09:31.737
VERY MAD ABOUT CRITICAL RACE

09:31.804 --> 09:33.105
THEORY RIGHT NOW.

09:33.172 --> 09:34.373
AND INSTINCTIVELY, YOU PROBABLY

09:34.440 --> 09:36.876
KNOW IT'S A MANUFACTURED PANIC.

09:36.943 --> 09:38.544
BUT THE FACT IS, THE FEAR AROUND

09:38.611 --> 09:41.247
IT IS HAVING REAL EFFECTS.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.882
LAST YEAR, GLENN YOUNGKIN WON

09:42.949 --> 09:44.216
THE GOVERNOR'S RACE IN VIRGINIA

09:44.283 --> 09:45.451
AFTER REPEATEDLY PROMISING THAT

09:45.518 --> 09:46.819
ON HIS FIRST DAY IN OFFICE HE'D

09:46.886 --> 09:47.820
BAN CRT FROM BEING TAUGHT IN

09:47.887 --> 09:50.022
SCHOOLS.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.324
MULTIPLE STATES HAVE PASSED LAWS

09:51.390 --> 09:52.758
OUTLAWING THE TEACHING OF IT.

09:52.825 --> 09:54.126
AND REPUBLICANS ARE LIKELY TO

09:54.193 --> 09:55.328
MAKE IT A MAJOR FOCUS OF THE

09:55.394 --> 09:57.396
MIDTERMS.

09:57.463 --> 09:58.831
WHEN IT COMES TO CRITICAL RACE

09:58.898 --> 09:59.565
THEORY, THINK OF IT LIKE

09:59.632 --> 10:02.101
RIHANNA'S PREGNANCY.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.636
EVEN IF YOU THINK IT HAS NOTHING

10:03.703 --> 10:05.237
TO DO WITH YOU, BELIEVE ME,

10:05.304 --> 10:06.339
YOU'RE GOING TO BE HEARING ABOUT

10:06.405 --> 10:09.542
IT A LOT THIS YEAR.

10:09.608 --> 10:11.043
SO GIVEN THAT, WE THOUGHT

10:11.110 --> 10:12.044
TONIGHT WE'D TAKE A STEP BACK

10:12.111 --> 10:13.079
AND LOOK AT WHAT CRITICAL RACE

10:13.145 --> 10:14.480
THEORY IS AND ISN'T, WHY THE

10:14.547 --> 10:17.083
PANIC AROUND IT HAS SPREAD, AND

10:17.149 --> 10:20.152
WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES MIGHT BE

10:20.219 --> 10:20.853
FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED.

10:20.920 --> 10:21.554
AND I REALIZE SOME OF YOU MAY

10:21.620 --> 10:23.089
ALREADY KNOW WHAT CRT IS.

10:23.155 --> 10:25.191
AFTER ALL, EXPLAINERS ON IT HAVE

10:25.257 --> 10:26.625
BECOME ONE OF THE MOST COMMON

10:26.692 --> 10:28.060
SIGHTS ON THE INTERNET, ALONG

10:28.127 --> 10:28.828
WITH MEDIOCRE WORDLE SCORES AND

10:28.894 --> 10:31.097
UGLY MONKEY JPEGs SOLD BY AND

10:31.163 --> 10:33.232
FOR DIPSHITS.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.901
BUT MANY ARE STILL VERY

10:35.968 --> 10:37.603
CONFUSED.

10:37.670 --> 10:39.238
A RECENT SURVEY FOUND THAT AN

10:39.305 --> 10:40.406
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF U.S.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.440
RESIDENTS HAVE A HARD TIME

10:41.507 --> 10:42.508
ARTICULATING EXACTLY WHAT

10:42.575 --> 10:44.977
CRT IS.

10:45.044 --> 10:47.046
AND THAT EVEN GOES FOR SOME OF

10:47.113 --> 10:48.214
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN YELLING

10:48.280 --> 10:51.384
ABOUT IT THE LOUDEST.

10:51.450 --> 10:52.952
>> I -- I'VE NEVER FIGURED OUT

10:53.019 --> 10:53.753
WHAT CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS, TO

10:53.819 --> 10:54.453
BE TOTALLY HONEST, AFTER A YEAR

10:54.520 --> 10:55.388
OF TALKING ABOUT IT.

10:55.454 --> 10:56.055
THEY ARE TEACHING THAT SOME

10:56.122 --> 10:56.655
RACES ARE MORALLY SUPERIOR TO

10:56.722 --> 10:57.390
OTHERS, THAT SOME ARE INHERENTLY

10:57.456 --> 10:58.257
SINFUL AND SOME ARE INHERENTLY

10:58.324 --> 10:59.125
SAINTLY, AND THAT'S IMMORAL TO

10:59.191 --> 11:01.293
TEACH THAT 'CAUSE IT'S WRONG.

11:01.360 --> 11:02.094
>> John: WOW.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.229
I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE EVER SEEN A

11:03.295 --> 11:04.630
PERSON CONFIDENTLY COMPLAIN

11:04.697 --> 11:05.631
ABOUT SOMETHING JUST SECONDS

11:05.698 --> 11:07.800
AFTER ADMITTING THEY DIDN'T KNOW

11:07.867 --> 11:09.802
SHIT ABOUT IT.

11:09.869 --> 11:11.103
"LOOK, I'VE NEVER FIGURED OUT

11:11.170 --> 11:12.271
HOW A CAR ENGINE WORKS, TO BE

11:12.338 --> 11:13.272
HONEST, BUT THERE'S A CHIMPANZEE

11:13.339 --> 11:15.241
UNDER THE HOOD TURNING A CRANK,

11:15.307 --> 11:16.575
AND WHEN YOU PRESS THE

11:16.642 --> 11:18.444
ACCELERATOR, IT POKES HIM WITH A

11:18.511 --> 11:19.478
SHARP STICK AND MAKES HIM CRANK

11:19.545 --> 11:20.479
FASTER, AND IT'S IMMORAL TO DO

11:20.546 --> 11:23.082
THAT BECAUSE IT'S WRONG."

11:23.149 --> 11:24.483
BUT OBVIOUSLY, THAT IS NOT WHAT

11:24.550 --> 11:26.419
CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS.

11:26.485 --> 11:27.586
IT'S THE NAME GIVEN TO A BODY OF

11:27.653 --> 11:28.754
LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP THAT BEGAN IN

11:28.821 --> 11:30.089
THE 1970s THAT ATTEMPTED TO

11:30.156 --> 11:33.192
UNDERSTAND WHY RACISM AND

11:33.259 --> 11:35.828
INEQUALITY PERSISTED AFTER THE

11:35.895 --> 11:36.796
CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

11:36.862 --> 11:37.630
THE CORE IDEA IS THAT RACISM IS

11:37.696 --> 11:38.898
NOT MERELY THE PRODUCT OF

11:38.964 --> 11:41.167
INDIVIDUAL BIAS OR PREJUDICE BUT

11:41.233 --> 11:41.967
ALSO SOMETHING THAT IS EMBEDDED

11:42.034 --> 11:44.136
IN LEGAL SYSTEMS AND POLICIES.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.971
AS FOR TUCKER'S NOTION THAT IT

11:46.038 --> 11:48.207
TEACHES THAT SOME RACES ARE

11:48.274 --> 11:50.743
SUPERIOR TO OTHERS -- OR THAT

11:50.810 --> 11:52.011
PARENT'S CLAIM THAT IT TEACHES

11:52.078 --> 11:53.045
KIDS TO HATE AMERICA --

11:53.112 --> 11:55.181
NONE OF THAT IS REMOTELY TRUE,

11:55.247 --> 11:56.115
AS KIMBERLE CRENSHAW, ONE OF

11:56.182 --> 11:58.317
CRT'S LEADING SCHOLARS POINTS

11:58.384 --> 12:00.953
OUT.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.488
>> CRITICAL RACE THEORY JUST

12:02.555 --> 12:03.489
SAYS, LET'S PAY ATTENTION TO

12:03.556 --> 12:05.191
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THIS

12:05.257 --> 12:06.826
COUNTRY AND HOW WHAT HAS

12:06.892 --> 12:08.394
HAPPENED IN THIS COUNTRY IS

12:08.461 --> 12:09.595
CONTINUING TO CREATE

12:09.662 --> 12:10.796
DIFFERENTIAL OUTCOMES SO WE CAN

12:10.863 --> 12:11.730
BECOME THAT COUNTRY THAT WE SAY

12:11.797 --> 12:13.432
WE ARE.

12:13.499 --> 12:14.834
SO CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS NOT

12:14.900 --> 12:16.302
ANTI-PATRIOTIC.

12:16.368 --> 12:18.637
IN FACT, IT IS MORE PATRIOTIC

12:18.704 --> 12:21.040
THAN THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED

12:21.107 --> 12:22.108
TO IT.

12:22.174 --> 12:23.109
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN THE 13TH

12:23.175 --> 12:23.976
AND THE 14TH AND THE 15TH

12:24.043 --> 12:24.977
AMENDMENT.

12:25.044 --> 12:26.745
WE BELIEVE IN THE PROMISES OF

12:26.812 --> 12:28.347
EQUALITY, AND WE KNOW WE CAN'T

12:28.414 --> 12:30.216
GET THERE IF WE CAN'T CONFRONT

12:30.282 --> 12:31.517
AND TALK HONESTLY ABOUT

12:31.584 --> 12:34.320
INEQUALITY.

12:34.386 --> 12:35.521
>> John: YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.456
AND INCIDENTALLY, IF YOU'VE JUST

12:37.523 --> 12:39.325
FOUND YOURSELF THERE WONDERING

12:39.391 --> 12:40.626
WHAT THE 13TH, 14TH, AND 15TH

12:40.693 --> 12:42.161
AMENDMENTS ARE, THAT ALONE MIGHT

12:42.228 --> 12:43.696
BE A GOOD SIGN WE DON'T TALK

12:43.762 --> 12:44.730
ABOUT THIS STUFF IN SCHOOLS

12:44.797 --> 12:47.700
ENOUGH.

12:47.766 --> 12:48.601
AND TO BE CLEAR, CRT IS

12:48.667 --> 12:50.236
GRADUATE-LEVEL LEGAL THEORY, SO

12:50.302 --> 12:51.303
UNLESS YOUR FIVE-YEAR-OLD IS

12:51.370 --> 12:52.638
CURRENTLY PURSUING A LAW DEGREE,

12:52.705 --> 12:55.708
THEY'RE NOT READING

12:55.774 --> 12:56.509
KIMBERLE CRENSHAW.

12:56.575 --> 12:57.643
BUT CRITICS OF IT ARGUE THAT THE

12:57.710 --> 12:59.245
IDEAS BEHIND CRT ARE BEING

12:59.311 --> 13:00.279
TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS AND OFTEN

13:00.346 --> 13:01.947
PRESENT A HYPERBOLICALLY

13:02.014 --> 13:03.048
DISTORTED VERSION OF WHAT THOSE

13:03.115 --> 13:06.619
IDEAS ARE.

13:06.685 --> 13:07.853
AND A KEY PERSON HERE IS THIS

13:07.920 --> 13:08.420
MAN, A CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST

13:08.487 --> 13:09.822
NAMED CHRISTOPHER RUFO.

13:09.889 --> 13:12.224
HE CLAIMS CRT IS ACTUALLY

13:12.291 --> 13:13.159
"A REVOLUTIONARY PROGRAM THAT

13:13.225 --> 13:14.393
WOULD OVERTURN THE PRINCIPLES OF

13:14.460 --> 13:15.327
THE DECLARATION AND DESTROY THE

13:15.394 --> 13:16.562
REMAINING STRUCTURE OF THE

13:16.629 --> 13:18.130
CONSTITUTION."

13:18.197 --> 13:19.665
WHICH IT JUST ISN'T.

13:19.732 --> 13:22.701
IT ISN'T THAT.

13:22.768 --> 13:23.936
BUT IN THE WAKE OF THE

13:24.003 --> 13:25.171
GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS, JUST AS

13:25.237 --> 13:26.972
AMERICA WAS BEGINNING TO GRAPPLE

13:27.039 --> 13:28.574
WITH SYSTEMIC RACISM, FOX NEWS

13:28.641 --> 13:30.809
BEGAN FEATURING RUFO ON AIR A

13:30.876 --> 13:31.977
LOT AS PART OF THEIR EFFORTS TO

13:32.044 --> 13:35.314
SWING THAT PENDULUM BACK HARD.

13:35.381 --> 13:37.483
IN ONE APPEARANCE, HE POINTED TO

13:37.550 --> 13:39.118
DIVERSITY TRAININGS IN

13:39.185 --> 13:40.419
GOVERNMENT AS EVIDENCE OF CRT'S

13:40.486 --> 13:43.522
INFLUENCE AND HE SPOKE DIRECTLY

13:43.589 --> 13:45.791
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP THROUGH THE

13:45.858 --> 13:46.625
CAMERA ABOUT WHAT HE WANTED TO

13:46.692 --> 13:47.259
SEE HAPPEN.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.594
>> THE PRESIDENT OF THE

13:48.661 --> 13:49.962
WHITE HOUSE, IT'S WITHIN THEIR

13:50.029 --> 13:52.298
AUTHORITY AND POWER TO

13:52.364 --> 13:55.868
IMMEDIATELY ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE

13:55.935 --> 13:56.769
ORDER ABOLISHING CRITICAL RACE

13:56.835 --> 13:57.736
THEORY TRAININGS FROM THE

13:57.803 --> 13:58.671
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

13:58.737 --> 13:59.471
AND I CALL ON THE PRESIDENT TO

13:59.538 --> 14:00.105
IMMEDIATELY ISSUE THIS EXECUTIVE

14:00.172 --> 14:01.273
ORDER AND -- AND STAMP OUT THIS

14:01.340 --> 14:02.441
DESTRUCTIVE, DIVISIVE,

14:02.508 --> 14:03.542
PSEUDOSCIENTIFIC IDEOLOGY AT ITS

14:03.609 --> 14:06.045
ROOT.

14:06.111 --> 14:07.379
>> John: NOW, DID TRUMP SEE

14:07.446 --> 14:08.647
THAT?

14:08.714 --> 14:11.083
I DUNNO.

14:11.150 --> 14:12.017
IS THE POPE A CATHOLIC?

14:12.084 --> 14:12.985
IS THE REASON BIG DIED THE FACT

14:13.052 --> 14:13.852
THAT CARRIE DIDN'T CALL 911 FAST

14:13.919 --> 14:16.255
ENOUGH?

14:16.322 --> 14:17.590
THE ANSWER TO ALL THOSE

14:17.656 --> 14:18.290
QUESTIONS IS YES, AND ALSO,

14:18.357 --> 14:19.024
SHE WAS RIGHT NOT TO DO IT.

14:19.091 --> 14:20.826
NO BIG LOSS.

14:20.893 --> 14:22.094
BECAUSE MARK MEADOWS, TRUMP'S

14:22.161 --> 14:22.928
CHIEF OF STAFF, HAS SINCE

14:22.995 --> 14:23.696
REVEALED PRESIDENT TRUMP SAW

14:23.762 --> 14:25.130
THAT INTERVIEW, AND WHEN RUFO

14:25.197 --> 14:26.732
SAID, "I CALL ON THE PRESIDENT

14:26.799 --> 14:28.234
TO IMMEDIATELY ISSUE THIS

14:28.300 --> 14:29.168
EXECUTIVE ORDER," QUOTE,

14:29.235 --> 14:30.236
"THAT'S WHAT WE DID."

14:30.302 --> 14:31.237
WHICH IS WEIRD.

14:31.303 --> 14:33.205
THERE SHOULD BE MORE STEPS THAN

14:33.272 --> 14:35.274
THAT.

14:35.341 --> 14:36.875
IT SHOULDN'T JUST GO, ONE, YELL

14:36.942 --> 14:39.511
YOUR WISH AT THE PRESIDENT,

14:39.578 --> 14:40.980
THEN, TWO, IT HAPPENS.

14:41.046 --> 14:42.181
IDEALLY YOU WANT AN EXECUTIVE

14:42.248 --> 14:44.183
BRANCH THAT'S A LITTLE MORE

14:44.250 --> 14:45.484
COMPLICATED THAN FUCKING SIRI.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.652
AND WITH THAT, CRT -- OR,

14:46.719 --> 14:47.620
CRUCIALLY, RUFO'S DEFINITION OF

14:47.686 --> 14:48.954
IT -- WAS SUDDENLY ABSOLUTELY

14:49.021 --> 14:51.423
EVERYWHERE.

14:51.490 --> 14:53.259
FOX NEWS KEPT PUSHING IT,

14:53.325 --> 14:55.594
MENTIONING THE TERM "CRITICAL

14:55.661 --> 15:02.468
RACE THEORY" NEARLY 5,000 TIMES

15:02.534 --> 15:03.168
LAST YEAR ALONE, AND THE NETWORK

15:03.235 --> 15:04.169
ZEROED IN ON ITS SUPPOSED USE IN

15:04.236 --> 15:05.738
SCHOOLS, WITH RUFO TELLING FOX'S

15:05.804 --> 15:07.106
AUDIENCE THAT CRT HAS "REALLY

15:07.172 --> 15:08.374
BECOME THE DEFAULT IDEOLOGY OF

15:08.440 --> 15:10.009
THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM."

15:10.075 --> 15:11.176
AND WHAT RUFO HAS BEEN CLEVERLY

15:11.243 --> 15:11.844
DOING IS CHERRY-PICKING THE

15:11.910 --> 15:13.946
WORST EXAMPLES HE CAN FIND OF

15:14.013 --> 15:14.647
LESSONS IN CLASSROOMS OR

15:14.713 --> 15:16.048
TRAINING MATERIALS FOR TEACHERS,

15:16.115 --> 15:17.416
AND SAYING, "THAT IS CRT."

15:17.483 --> 15:18.417
AND HE'S OPENLY ADMITTED THAT

15:18.484 --> 15:20.753
HE'S BEEN ENGAGED IN A

15:20.819 --> 15:23.088
DELIBERATE BRANDING EXERCISE,

15:23.155 --> 15:26.492
TWEETING, "WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY

15:26.558 --> 15:28.961
FROZEN THEIR BRAND -- 'CRITICAL

15:29.028 --> 15:30.729
RACE THEORY' -- INTO THE PUBLIC

15:30.796 --> 15:32.598
CONVERSATION AND ARE STEADILY

15:32.665 --> 15:36.568
DRIVING UP NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS.

15:36.635 --> 15:37.403
THE GOAL IS TO HAVE THE PUBLIC

15:37.469 --> 15:38.370
READ SOMETHING CRAZY IN THE

15:38.437 --> 15:39.238
NEWSPAPER AND IMMEDIATELY THINK

15:39.305 --> 15:41.206
'CRITICAL RACE THEORY.'"

15:41.273 --> 15:43.642
AND THE THING IS, IT FUCKING

15:43.709 --> 15:45.377
WORKED.

15:45.444 --> 15:46.812
BECAUSE WHENEVER YOU HEAR "CRT"

15:46.879 --> 15:48.847
NOW, YOU ARE NOT HEARING ABOUT

15:48.914 --> 15:51.650
THE ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE.

15:51.717 --> 15:53.452
YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT A CATEGORY

15:53.519 --> 15:54.653
SO BROAD IT ENCOMPASSES BOTH

15:54.720 --> 15:55.521
"THE CRAZIEST THING IN THE

15:55.587 --> 15:56.755
NEWSPAPER" AND ALSO, CRUCIALLY,

15:56.822 --> 15:58.557
"ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE

15:58.624 --> 16:01.593
THAT SOMEONE DOES NOT WANT TO

16:01.660 --> 16:03.028
HAVE."

16:03.095 --> 16:06.098
AND LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING

16:06.165 --> 16:08.233
DISCUSSING RACE IN A CLASSROOM

16:08.300 --> 16:09.201
IS EASY OR EVEN ALWAYS DONE

16:09.268 --> 16:09.902
WELL.

16:09.968 --> 16:11.603
EXPERTS IN THIS FIELD WILL

16:11.670 --> 16:12.371
READILY ADMIT THAT.

16:12.438 --> 16:13.405
>> NOW, HAVE YOU SEEN BAD

16:13.472 --> 16:14.940
IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THIS?

16:15.007 --> 16:17.176
>> OF COURSE, RIGHT?

16:17.242 --> 16:18.243
THAT'S LIKE ASKING, HAVE I SEEN

16:18.310 --> 16:19.511
A BAD MATH LESSON?

16:19.578 --> 16:20.646
[CHUCKLES]

16:20.713 --> 16:22.681
LIKE, YES, TEACHERS ARE HUMANS,

16:22.748 --> 16:24.550
ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE TRYING TO

16:24.616 --> 16:27.086
FIGURE OUT HOW TO TEACH ABOUT

16:27.152 --> 16:29.254
RACE AND RACISM.

16:29.321 --> 16:30.289
>> John: EXACTLY, TEACHERS ARE

16:30.356 --> 16:32.891
HUMAN AND CAN MAKE MISTAKES.

16:32.958 --> 16:34.126
FRANKLY, I'M SURPRISED THEY

16:34.193 --> 16:39.098
DON'T MAKE MORE.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.666
THEY WAKE UP INSANELY EARLY AND

16:40.733 --> 16:41.900
SPEND ALL DAY GETTING LOW-KEY

16:41.967 --> 16:43.035
ROASTED BY TEENAGERS FOR AN

16:43.102 --> 16:43.769
AMOUNT OF MONEY BEST DESCRIBED

16:43.836 --> 16:45.304
AS "COMPLETELY HARROWING."

16:45.371 --> 16:47.906
THE VERY FACT ANY STUDENT IN

16:47.973 --> 16:49.575
AMERICA KNOWS WHAT A COVALENT

16:49.641 --> 16:50.342
BOND IS IS A FUCKING MIRACLE,

16:50.409 --> 16:52.077
AND EVERY ADULT INVOLVED

16:52.144 --> 16:54.113
DESERVES THE CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL

16:54.179 --> 16:55.647
OF HONOR.

16:55.714 --> 16:56.615
AND THE FACT IS, YOU CAN FIND

16:56.682 --> 17:00.319
EXAMPLES OF CLUMSY, SHITTY

17:00.386 --> 17:03.088
LESSONS.

17:03.155 --> 17:05.190
ONE SCHOOL USED A

17:05.257 --> 17:06.325
"PRIVILEGE BINGO" CARD, WHICH

17:06.392 --> 17:08.293
SURE SEEMS LIKE A GLIB WAY TO

17:08.360 --> 17:08.927
HANDLE A VERY SERIOUS SUBJECT.

17:08.994 --> 17:09.661
ANOTHER CLASSIC LESSON OVER THE

17:09.728 --> 17:10.796
YEARS HAS BEEN TO TEACH ABOUT

17:10.863 --> 17:12.164
PREJUDICE METAPHORICALLY BY

17:12.231 --> 17:13.432
DIVIDING A CLASSROOM UP BY

17:13.499 --> 17:14.099
EYE COLOR, WITH BROWN EYES

17:14.166 --> 17:15.000
PEOPLE, FOR INSTANCE, BEING THE

17:15.067 --> 17:15.801
LOWEST TIER, AND THEN BEING

17:15.868 --> 17:17.236
TREATED TERRIBLY.

17:17.302 --> 17:18.737
AND IF YOU DO THAT IN A DIVERSE

17:18.804 --> 17:21.173
CLASSROOM AND THINK FOR A SECOND

17:21.240 --> 17:25.310
ABOUT WHO'S MORE LIKELY TO HAVE

17:25.377 --> 17:26.478
BROWN EYES, YOU CAN PROBABLY

17:26.545 --> 17:27.346
IMMEDIATELY SEE JUST HOW BADLY

17:27.413 --> 17:29.848
THAT LESSON COULD GO.

17:29.915 --> 17:31.417
THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN AT

17:31.483 --> 17:33.051
LEAST ONE SCHOOL IN THE CHICAGO

17:33.118 --> 17:33.886
AREA, AND THE REASON I KNOW THAT

17:33.952 --> 17:35.487
IS THAT THIS KID WAS IN THE

17:35.554 --> 17:36.555
CLASS THAT DAY, AND SHE'S ONE OF

17:36.622 --> 17:37.356
OUR WRITERS NOW.

17:37.423 --> 17:38.123
ALI, WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THAT

17:38.190 --> 17:39.658
LESSON?

17:39.725 --> 17:41.226
>> IT WAS PRETTY FUCKED UP.

17:41.293 --> 17:43.061
>> John: YEAH!

17:43.128 --> 17:46.832
YEAH, I BET IT WAS!

17:46.899 --> 17:48.567
BUT THE FACT IS, MANY EDUCATORS

17:48.634 --> 17:49.501
ARE CURRENTLY WORKING VERY HARD

17:49.568 --> 17:50.803
TO FIND AGE-APPROPRIATE WAYS TO

17:50.869 --> 17:52.337
TALK ABOUT RACE AND RACISM IN

17:52.404 --> 17:55.474
THE CLASSROOM.

17:55.541 --> 17:57.943
AND IF YOU DO IT RIGHT, YOU

17:58.010 --> 17:58.844
DON'T STOP AT THE CIVIL RIGHTS

17:58.911 --> 18:01.180
MOVEMENT, YOU TELL THE STORY ALL

18:01.246 --> 18:03.148
THE WAY TO THE PRESENT DAY,

18:03.215 --> 18:07.753
WHICH KIDS WANT AND NEED.

18:07.820 --> 18:08.887
THEY HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT

18:08.954 --> 18:10.823
THEY CAN SEE WITH THEIR OWN

18:10.889 --> 18:11.957
EYES, AND THEY DESERVE GOOD

18:12.024 --> 18:12.191
ANSWERS.

18:12.257 --> 18:12.858
AND IT IS FRANKLY FAR BETTER FOR

18:12.925 --> 18:13.692
THEM TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS

18:13.759 --> 18:14.259
IN A SUPPORTIVE EDUCATIONAL

18:14.326 --> 18:14.827
ENVIRONMENT RATHER THAN THE

18:14.893 --> 18:15.561
POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE:

18:15.627 --> 18:16.695
DURING A SCREAMING MATCH AT

18:16.762 --> 18:18.831
THANKSGIVING.

18:18.897 --> 18:20.732
BUT THE PANIC OVER CRT THREATENS

18:20.799 --> 18:22.167
TO SHUT THOSE CONVERSATIONS

18:22.234 --> 18:22.768
DOWN.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.036
AND THAT IS NOT ALL IT IS LIKELY

18:24.102 --> 18:29.708
TO DO.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.243
BECAUSE SOME PUSHING THIS PANIC

18:31.310 --> 18:32.044
THE HARDEST ARE ACTUALLY USING

18:32.110 --> 18:32.611
IT TO ADVANCE A MUCH BIGGER

18:32.678 --> 18:33.245
AGENDA THAT THEY'VE WANTED FOR A

18:33.312 --> 18:35.514
VERY LONG TIME, AND THAT IS

18:35.581 --> 18:37.416
SCHOOL CHOICE -- BASICALLY,

18:37.483 --> 18:43.489
LETTING PARENTS TAKE TAX DOLLARS

18:43.555 --> 18:44.223
AFFORDED TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOLING

18:44.289 --> 18:44.890
OF THEIR KID AND USE THEM AT ANY

18:44.957 --> 18:45.691
SCHOOL THEY LIKE.

18:45.757 --> 18:46.892
HERE IS CHRIS RUFO AGAIN, LAYING

18:46.959 --> 18:48.327
OUT THAT EXACT STRATEGY.

18:48.393 --> 18:49.261
>> FIRST, WE HAVE TO JUST GET IT

18:49.328 --> 18:50.562
OUT OF SCHOOLS.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.331
WE HAVE TO BAN IT AND

18:52.397 --> 18:52.931
ABOLISH IT.

18:52.998 --> 18:54.099
BUT IN THE LONG TERM, WHAT WE

18:54.166 --> 18:55.067
NEED TO DO IS GIVE EVERY PARENT

18:55.133 --> 18:56.201
IN THIS COUNTRY A RIGHT TO EXIT

18:56.268 --> 18:57.903
FAILING INSTITUTIONS.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.138
NO CHILD SHOULD BE TRAPPED IN A

19:00.205 --> 19:01.874
FAILING PUBLIC SCHOOL THAT

19:01.940 --> 19:03.275
VIOLATES HIS SENSE OF

19:03.342 --> 19:04.710
CONSCIENCE, THAT VIOLATES THE

19:04.776 --> 19:07.212
VALUES OF THE PARENTS.

19:07.279 --> 19:08.847
EVERY PARENT SHOULD TAKE THOSE

19:08.914 --> 19:09.648
EDUCATION DOLLARS ANYWHERE THAT

19:09.715 --> 19:10.716
THEY WISH.

19:10.782 --> 19:11.817
>> RIGHT.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.252
>> SCHOOL CHOICE WILL LIBERATE

19:13.318 --> 19:14.286
PEOPLE.

19:14.353 --> 19:15.220
IT WILL EMPOWER PEOPLE AND IT

19:15.287 --> 19:16.221
WILL ACTUALLY DEPOLARIZE SOME OF

19:16.288 --> 19:18.290
THESE NATIONAL FIGHTS THAT WE'VE

19:18.357 --> 19:19.157
SEEN.

19:19.224 --> 19:20.192
>> John: OH, SO YOU'RE DOING ALL

19:20.259 --> 19:21.460
THIS TO TONE DOWN PARTISAN

19:21.527 --> 19:22.694
FIGHTS, ARE YOU, CHRIS?

19:22.761 --> 19:23.729
VERY COOL OF YOU.

19:23.795 --> 19:25.397
YOU'VE PROBABLY NOTICED THAT

19:25.464 --> 19:26.798
GENERAL WAVE OF CALM CHILL VIBES

19:26.865 --> 19:29.067
SWEEPING THE NATION LATELY.

19:29.134 --> 19:30.469
IF THERE IS ONE WORD I WOULD USE

19:30.536 --> 19:33.105
TO DESCRIBE EVERY IMAGE COMING

19:33.171 --> 19:34.673
OUT OF A SCHOOL BOARD MEETING

19:34.740 --> 19:37.809
THESE DAYS, IT IS "DEPOLARIZED."

19:37.876 --> 19:40.412
LOOK, IT IS NOT JUST RUFO.

19:40.479 --> 19:41.980
CONSERVATIVE ORGANIZATIONS THAT

19:42.047 --> 19:43.348
HAVE LONG PUSHED FOR SCHOOL

19:43.415 --> 19:44.049
CHOICE, LIKE THE HERITAGE

19:44.116 --> 19:45.050
FOUNDATION AND FREEDOMWORKS,

19:45.117 --> 19:46.919
HAVE POURED MONEY INTO THIS

19:46.985 --> 19:48.620
FIGHT.

19:48.687 --> 19:49.888
AND OF COURSE, NO SCHOOL CHOICE

19:49.955 --> 19:51.256
PUSH WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT

19:51.323 --> 19:54.726
LIFELONG RICH PERSON AND

19:54.793 --> 19:55.661
OCCASIONAL EDUCATION SECRETARY

19:55.727 --> 19:56.662
BETSY DEVOS, WHO WROTE AN OP-ED

19:56.728 --> 19:59.264
TITLED "LET'S LIBERATE KIDS FROM

19:59.331 --> 20:01.300
RACE INDOCTRINATION -- WITH

20:01.366 --> 20:04.536
SCHOOL CHOICE."

20:04.603 --> 20:05.704
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW, THIS IS

20:05.771 --> 20:06.905
JUST NOTHING NEW.

20:06.972 --> 20:08.607
THERE IS A LONG HISTORY OF

20:08.674 --> 20:11.777
RESPONDING TO RACIAL PANIC WITH

20:11.843 --> 20:12.945
A PUSH FOR SCHOOL CHOICE.

20:13.011 --> 20:14.980
IN FACT, THE ROOTS OF THE SCHOOL

20:15.047 --> 20:17.115
CHOICE MOVEMENT TRACE BACK TO

20:17.182 --> 20:18.183
THE BROWN VS. BOARD OF EDUCATION

20:18.250 --> 20:18.917
DECISION, WHEN SOUTHERN STATES

20:18.984 --> 20:19.785
ADOPTED VOUCHER PROGRAMS TO

20:19.851 --> 20:21.219
FACILITATE THE CREATION OF

20:21.286 --> 20:22.020
PRIVATE SCHOOLS CALLED

20:22.087 --> 20:23.422
"SEGREGATION ACADEMIES."

20:23.488 --> 20:24.656
AND SOME OF THOSE TAKING

20:24.723 --> 20:26.825
ADVANTAGE OF SCHOOL CHOICE TODAY

20:26.892 --> 20:28.260
SURE SEEM TO BE DOING SOME HEAVY

20:28.327 --> 20:31.029
INDOCTRINATION OF THEIR OWN.

20:31.096 --> 20:32.197
TAKE FLORIDA.

20:32.264 --> 20:33.632
IT'S ONE OF THE STATES THAT

20:33.699 --> 20:34.967
ALLOWS PUBLIC MONEY TO GO TO

20:35.033 --> 20:36.568
VOUCHER SCHOOLS, AND A FEW YEARS

20:36.635 --> 20:38.637
BACK, AN INVESTIGATION INTO SOME

20:38.704 --> 20:40.005
OF THEM FOUND COMMONLY USED

20:40.072 --> 20:42.307
TEXTBOOKS THAT "DOWNPLAYED THE

20:42.374 --> 20:43.175
HORRORS OF SLAVERY."

20:43.241 --> 20:44.443
ONE OF THEM IS THIS ONE,

20:44.509 --> 20:47.179
"AMERICA: LAND I LOVE," WHICH

20:47.245 --> 20:49.915
HAS ALL THE KIND OF BULLSHIT

20:49.982 --> 20:50.882
YOU'D EXPECT -- THAT THE

20:50.949 --> 20:51.917
CIVIL WAR WAS FOUGHT FOR STATES'

20:51.984 --> 20:52.584
RIGHTS -- BUT IT ALSO STATES

20:52.651 --> 20:53.518
THAT, DURING THE ANTEBELLUM

20:53.585 --> 20:54.786
PERIOD, "THE SLAVE WHO KNEW

20:54.853 --> 20:56.088
CHRIST HAD MORE FREEDOM THAN A

20:56.154 --> 20:58.557
FREE PERSON WHO DID NOT KNOW THE

20:58.624 --> 21:01.326
SAVIOR."

21:01.393 --> 21:04.463
WHICH IS NOT JUST OFFENSIVE,

21:04.529 --> 21:06.932
IT IS PROFOUNDLY STUPID.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.100
ANY KID READING THAT ABSOLUTE

21:08.166 --> 21:09.901
TROMBONE SLIDE OF A SENTENCE

21:09.968 --> 21:12.237
WOULD INSTANTLY DROP TWO FULL

21:12.304 --> 21:13.572
GRADES.

21:13.639 --> 21:16.274
IT SOUNDS LESS LIKE SOMETHING

21:16.341 --> 21:17.309
YOU'D FIND IN A TEXTBOOK AND

21:17.376 --> 21:18.377
MORE LIKE SOMETHING YOU'D FIND

21:18.443 --> 21:19.878
CROCHETED ON A THROW PILLOW IN

21:19.945 --> 21:21.346
PAULA DEEN'S LIVING ROOM.

21:21.413 --> 21:23.548
SO IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT

21:23.615 --> 21:24.750
"RACIAL INDOCTRINATION" OF

21:24.816 --> 21:25.517
SCHOOLKIDS, THIS MIGHT BE A

21:25.584 --> 21:27.486
BETTER PLACE TO START.

21:27.552 --> 21:29.488
BUT THE THING IS, EVEN A

21:29.554 --> 21:32.391
MANUFACTURED PANIC IS A PANIC.

21:32.457 --> 21:33.825
THOSE PARENTS AT SCHOOL BOARD

21:33.892 --> 21:35.827
MEETINGS ARE GENUINELY ANGRY.

21:35.894 --> 21:37.929
AND AS ANY LITTLE LEAGUE COACH

21:37.996 --> 21:39.231
KNOWS, ONCE YOU REACH A CRITICAL

21:39.297 --> 21:40.732
MASS OF ANGRY WHITE PARENTS,

21:40.799 --> 21:44.903
THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES.

21:44.970 --> 21:45.971
IN TEXAS, THIS HIGH SCHOOL

21:46.038 --> 21:47.839
PRINCIPAL WAS FORCED OUT OF HIS

21:47.906 --> 21:50.108
JOB AFTER BEING ACCUSED AT A

21:50.175 --> 21:51.610
SCHOOL BOARD MEETING OF

21:51.677 --> 21:54.413
PROMOTING CRT BY SOMEONE WHO

21:54.479 --> 21:56.415
WASN'T EVEN A PARENT AT HIS

21:56.481 --> 21:57.382
SCHOOL.

21:57.449 --> 21:59.351
AND IN TENNESSEE, THIS

21:59.418 --> 22:00.852
CURRENT AFFAIRS TEACHER WAS

22:00.919 --> 22:02.554
FIRED FOR NOT GIVING VARYING

22:02.621 --> 22:03.755
POINTS OF VIEW AFTER HE GAVE

22:03.822 --> 22:04.322
STUDENTS A TA-NEHISI COATES

22:04.389 --> 22:04.956
ARTICLE AND SHOWED THEM KYLA

22:05.023 --> 22:05.691
JENEE LACEY'S POEM

22:05.757 --> 22:06.725
"WHITE PRIVILEGE."

22:06.792 --> 22:07.893
AND HE HAD A PRETTY DECENT

22:07.959 --> 22:09.695
RESPONSE TO THAT CRITICISM:

22:09.761 --> 22:13.432
>> I THINK TO ME, THE VARYING

22:13.498 --> 22:16.568
VIEWPOINT IS KYLA JANEE LACEY

22:16.635 --> 22:19.771
AND IT IS TA-NEHISI COATES.

22:19.838 --> 22:23.208
THOSE ARE PERSPECTIVES THAT MY

22:23.275 --> 22:24.276
STUDENTS AREN'T EXPOSED TO ON A

22:24.342 --> 22:26.111
DAILY BASIS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

22:26.178 --> 22:28.046
WE LIVE IN THAT WHITE DOMINANT

22:28.113 --> 22:31.249
EVANGELICAL ENVIRONMENT.

22:31.316 --> 22:32.818
>> John: RIGHT, WHEN YOU LIVE IN

22:32.884 --> 22:35.087
A MOSTLY WHITE ENVIRONMENT, THE

22:35.153 --> 22:38.824
VOICES OF BLACK PEOPLE CAN BE

22:38.890 --> 22:40.726
THE VARYING POINT OF VIEW FOR

22:40.792 --> 22:42.894
YOU.

22:42.961 --> 22:45.797
AND NOT JUST ON

22:45.864 --> 22:46.698
CURRENT EVENTS -- ON LOTS OF

22:46.765 --> 22:47.466
THINGS WHITE PEOPLE MIGHT

22:47.532 --> 22:48.266
OTHERWISE ASSUME, EVEN TRIVIAL

22:48.333 --> 22:49.167
ONES, LIKE "IT'S OKAY TO GO OUT

22:49.234 --> 22:50.402
IN A BLIZZARD IN SHORTS," AND

22:50.469 --> 22:51.503
"IF I ARGUE TH THIS COP I CAN

22:51.570 --> 22:54.072
PROBABLY GET OUT OF A TICKET,"

22:54.139 --> 22:56.541
AND "TIME TRAVEL WOULD BE A FUN

22:56.608 --> 22:57.909
AND STRESS-FREE ACTIVITY.

22:57.976 --> 22:58.477
"OOH, THE 1930s!

22:58.543 --> 23:00.545
I CAN'T WAIT TO LOOK AROUND!"

23:00.612 --> 23:01.446
UNFORTUNATELY, THOSE SITUATIONS

23:01.513 --> 23:03.448
ARE NOW ONLY LIKELY TO BECOME

23:03.515 --> 23:04.449
MORE COMMON.

23:04.516 --> 23:06.985
SINCE JANUARY OF LAST YEAR,

23:07.052 --> 23:08.186
37 STATES HAVE INTRODUCED BILLS

23:08.253 --> 23:10.455
OR TAKEN OTHER STEPS THAT WOULD

23:10.522 --> 23:11.523
RESTRICT TEACHING "CRITICAL RACE

23:11.590 --> 23:12.758
THEORY," OR LIMIT HOW TEACHERS

23:12.824 --> 23:19.297
CAN DISCUSS RACISM.

23:19.364 --> 23:20.499
AND THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THESE

23:20.565 --> 23:21.032
HAS OFTEN BEEN MORE THAN A

23:21.099 --> 23:21.366
LITTLE FLIMSY.

23:21.433 --> 23:21.967
HERE'S ONE TENNESSEE LAWMAKER

23:22.033 --> 23:22.834
EXPLAINING WHY HE WAS PUSHING

23:22.901 --> 23:25.871
FOR HIS STATE'S BILL.

23:25.937 --> 23:27.239
>> LISTEN TO THE FOLLOWING

23:27.305 --> 23:29.007
QUOTES FROM AN EMAIL FORWARDED

23:29.074 --> 23:29.474
TO ME CONCERNING A

23:29.541 --> 23:30.041
SEVEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL

23:30.108 --> 23:30.609
IN WILLIAMSON COUNTY.

23:30.675 --> 23:32.978
THE LITTLE GIRL TOLD HER MOTHER,

23:33.044 --> 23:34.246
"I'M ASHAMED THAT I'M WHITE."

23:34.312 --> 23:35.580
THE DAUGHTER THEN ASKED HER

23:35.647 --> 23:36.548
MOTHER, "IS THERE SOMETHING

23:36.615 --> 23:38.617
WRONG WITH ME?

23:38.683 --> 23:40.152
WHY AM I HATED SO MUCH?"

23:40.218 --> 23:42.020
>> John: OKAY, BUT THE THING TO

23:42.087 --> 23:44.523
DO IN THAT SITUATION ISN'T TO

23:44.589 --> 23:46.458
PASS A LAW LIMITING THE

23:46.525 --> 23:47.125
DISCUSSION OF RACE IN THE

23:47.192 --> 23:48.460
CLASSROOM.

23:48.527 --> 23:50.295
IT'S TO ASK LITERALLY ONE

23:50.362 --> 23:51.963
FOLLOW-UP QUESTION.

23:52.030 --> 23:52.564
LIKE, "WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO

23:52.631 --> 23:53.165
MAKE YOU THINK THE OTHER KIDS

23:53.231 --> 23:53.632
HATE YOU?"

23:53.698 --> 23:54.800
OR, "DID ANY ADULTS STEP IN WHEN

23:54.866 --> 23:55.400
YOU FELT THIS WAY?"

23:55.467 --> 23:57.369
OR, "DO YOU EVEN EXIST?"

23:57.435 --> 23:58.970
BECAUSE WHEN REPORTERS LOOKED

23:59.037 --> 24:00.071
INTO THIS, YOU SHOULD KNOW THEY

24:00.138 --> 24:03.208
FOUND NO PARENT HAD COME FORWARD

24:03.275 --> 24:06.645
TO THAT SCHOOL'S PRINCIPAL,

24:06.711 --> 24:09.948
TEACHERS, OR DISTRICT OFFICIALS

24:10.015 --> 24:12.617
WITH THAT COMPLAINT, AND

24:12.684 --> 24:13.885
ADMINISTRATORS THERE WEREN'T

24:13.952 --> 24:15.754
ABLE TO PINPOINT ANY STUDENT WHO

24:15.821 --> 24:16.721
MIGHT BE UPSET, OR LESSONS THAT

24:16.788 --> 24:17.355
COULD HAVE BEEN UPSETTING.

24:17.422 --> 24:18.290
AND IF THAT'S HOW WE'RE ARGUING

24:18.356 --> 24:18.924
THINGS NOW, I SHOULD PROBABLY

24:18.990 --> 24:19.691
MENTION: I, TOO, HAPPEN TO HAVE

24:19.758 --> 24:20.926
AN EMAIL FORWARD FROM A

24:20.992 --> 24:22.727
DIFFERENT LITTLE WHITE GIRL --

24:22.794 --> 24:23.795
WAY CUTER THAN THE FIRST ONE, BY

24:23.862 --> 24:25.197
THE WAY -- WHO SAID THAT FIRST

24:25.263 --> 24:26.798
GIRL'S STORY IS COMPLETE

24:26.865 --> 24:27.699
BULLSHIT.

24:27.766 --> 24:32.571
AND THE THING IS, BY TENNESSEE

24:32.637 --> 24:33.939
LAW, IT SEEMS I SIMPLY HAVE TO

24:34.005 --> 24:34.406
BELIEVE HER.

24:34.472 --> 24:35.307
BUT THAT LAWMAKER ACTUALLY

24:35.373 --> 24:35.974
ILLUSTRATES THE PROBLEM FACING

24:36.041 --> 24:37.776
LEGISLATORS CURRENTLY TRYING TO

24:37.843 --> 24:39.411
OUTLAW SOMETHING THEY CAN'T

24:39.477 --> 24:40.345
DEFINE.

24:40.412 --> 24:41.012
BECAUSE WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO

24:41.079 --> 24:41.847
DO?

24:41.913 --> 24:42.914
PASS A LAW SAYING KIDS CAN'T

24:42.981 --> 24:46.985
FEEL BAD?

24:47.052 --> 24:47.485
WELL, IT TURNS OUT YES.

24:47.552 --> 24:48.053
BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

24:48.119 --> 24:48.620
TENNESSEE DID.

24:48.687 --> 24:50.255
THEY PASSED A LAW PROHIBITING

24:50.322 --> 24:52.057
ANY TEACHING THAT WOULD CAUSE

24:52.123 --> 24:53.425
"DISCOMFORT, GUILT, ANGUISH, OR

24:53.491 --> 24:54.492
DISTRESS SOLELY BECAUSE OF THE

24:54.559 --> 24:56.494
INDIVIDUAL'S RACE OR SEX."

24:56.561 --> 24:59.464
WHICH IS VERY BROAD.

24:59.531 --> 25:00.632
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE

25:00.699 --> 25:02.267
THIS, BUT I JUST RECEIVED

25:02.334 --> 25:05.270
ANOTHER EMAIL THIS SECOND FROM A

25:05.337 --> 25:07.873
THIRD TENNESSEE WHITE GIRL WHO

25:07.939 --> 25:09.708
SAYS, "WHAT FUCKING IDIOTS ARE

25:09.774 --> 25:10.675
WRITING THESE LAWS AND HOW MANY

25:10.742 --> 25:11.243
FICTITIOUS CHILDREN ARE THEY

25:11.309 --> 25:12.177
GOING TO MAKE UP TO JUSTIFY

25:12.244 --> 25:13.078
THEM?

25:13.144 --> 25:14.946
P.S., I HONESTLY PREFERRED THE

25:15.013 --> 25:16.848
NEW ZAZU."

25:16.915 --> 25:19.818
AND, WOW!

25:19.885 --> 25:21.219
WHAT A NICE THING TO SAY FROM A

25:21.286 --> 25:22.387
DEFINITELY REAL CHILD.

25:22.454 --> 25:24.756
AND LOOK, WE'VE TALKED BEFORE ON

25:24.823 --> 25:26.491
THIS SHOW ABOUT THE MULTIPLE

25:26.558 --> 25:27.425
PROBLEMS WITH TEACHING KIDS A

25:27.492 --> 25:29.694
SANITIZED VERSION OF U.S.

25:29.761 --> 25:31.529
HISTORY, AND HOW, AS FAR BACK AS

25:31.596 --> 25:32.597
A CENTURY AGO, GROUPS LIKE THE

25:32.664 --> 25:38.837
UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE

25:38.904 --> 25:39.471
CONFEDERACY WERE RESHAPING

25:39.537 --> 25:40.005
TEXTBOOKS TO DOWNPLAY ITS

25:40.071 --> 25:40.839
HORRORS.

25:40.906 --> 25:41.907
AND IT SEEMS HERE WE GO AGAIN.

25:41.973 --> 25:42.941
BECAUSE LAWMAKERS ARE TRYING TO

25:43.008 --> 25:44.276
MICROMANAGE SCHOOL CURRICULUMS,

25:44.342 --> 25:45.911
SOMETIMES PRETTY INEPTLY.

25:45.977 --> 25:47.479
A BILL PROPOSED IN VIRGINIA

25:47.545 --> 25:48.747
CONTAINS A SECTION LISTING SOME

25:48.813 --> 25:50.448
OF THE "FOUNDING DOCUMENTS" IT'S

25:50.515 --> 25:51.116
OKAY TO TEACH -- A LIST THAT

25:51.182 --> 25:52.284
INCLUDES THE DECLARATION OF

25:52.350 --> 25:54.286
INDEPENDENCE, THE CONSTITUTION,

25:54.352 --> 25:55.820
AND "THE FIRST DEBATE BETWEEN

25:55.887 --> 25:57.088
ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND

25:57.155 --> 25:58.156
FREDERICK DOUGLASS" --

25:58.223 --> 26:00.225
WHICH, I HOPE YOU KNOW, IS NOT A

26:00.292 --> 26:02.294
THING THAT HAPPENED.

26:02.360 --> 26:03.461
THE LINCOLN-DOUGLAS DEBATES

26:03.528 --> 26:04.930
WERE, OF COURSE, BETWEEN

26:04.996 --> 26:06.731
SENATOR STEPHEN DOUGLAS

26:06.798 --> 26:08.533
AND HIS OPPONENT,

26:08.600 --> 26:13.805
A 2020 LINCOLN NAVIGATOR.

26:13.872 --> 26:15.774
SO READ YOUR HISTORY, EVERYONE.

26:15.840 --> 26:16.374
FACTS MATTER HERE.

26:16.441 --> 26:17.375
BUT MAYBE THE MOST INSULTING

26:17.442 --> 26:18.977
DISTORTION OF HISTORY IS IN THE

26:19.044 --> 26:21.413
QUOTE THAT EVERY SINGLE ANTI-CRT

26:21.479 --> 26:22.781
ACTIVIST SEEMS TO LOVE TO

26:22.847 --> 26:23.548
INVOKE.

26:23.615 --> 26:25.951
>> YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT MLK

26:26.017 --> 26:28.386
STOOD FOR, HE SAID HE DIDN'T

26:28.453 --> 26:30.455
WANT PEOPLE JUDGED ON THE COLOR

26:30.522 --> 26:32.390
OF THEIR SKIN BUT ON THE CONTENT

26:32.457 --> 26:33.224
OF THEIR CHARACTER.

26:33.291 --> 26:34.225
>> YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE IT WAS

26:34.292 --> 26:36.594
MARTIN LUTHER KING THAT SAID,

26:36.661 --> 26:37.595
WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HIS

26:37.662 --> 26:38.029
CHILDREN THAT...

26:38.096 --> 26:38.930
>> HE DIDN'T WANT HIS CHILDREN

26:38.997 --> 26:39.397
TO BE JUDGED...

26:39.464 --> 26:41.232
>> ON THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN...

26:41.299 --> 26:42.467
>> BUT BY THE CONTENT OF THEIR

26:42.534 --> 26:42.834
CHARACTER.

26:42.901 --> 26:44.269
>> CONTENT OF THEIR CHARACTER,

26:44.336 --> 26:46.438
NOT BY THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN.

26:46.504 --> 26:47.605
>> CONTENT OF OUR CHARACTER, NOT

26:47.672 --> 26:50.008
THE COLOR OF OUR SKIN.

26:50.075 --> 26:51.676
>> AND THE IMMORTAL WORDS OF

26:51.743 --> 26:53.511
DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING RING IN

26:53.578 --> 26:54.145
OUR EARS THAT WE MUST...

26:54.212 --> 26:54.913
>> JUDGE OTHERS NOT BY THE...

26:54.980 --> 26:55.380
>> COLOR OF THEIR...

26:55.447 --> 26:55.847
>> SKIN, BUT BY THE..

26:55.914 --> 26:56.181
>> CONTENT...

26:56.247 --> 26:56.715
>> OF THEIR...

26:56.781 --> 26:58.149
>> THE LEFT WANTS US TO

26:58.216 --> 26:59.317
CONSTANTLY FOCUS ON SKIN COLOR.

26:59.384 --> 27:00.385
IT'S DESTRUCTIVE.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.519
MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. IS

27:01.586 --> 27:06.925
ROLLING OVER IN HIS GRAVE.

27:06.992 --> 27:10.328
>> John: YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT, I

27:10.395 --> 27:11.062
BET HE IS, ACTUALLY.

27:11.129 --> 27:11.696
IN FACT, I'M PRETTY SURE EVERY

27:11.763 --> 27:12.330
TIME SOMEONE USES HIS WORDS THAT

27:12.397 --> 27:12.897
WAY, DR. KING'S ILLUSTRIOUS

27:12.964 --> 27:15.133
REMAINS SPIN FAST ENOUGH TO

27:15.200 --> 27:15.700
POWER THE EASTERN FUCKING

27:15.767 --> 27:19.804
SEABOARD.

27:19.871 --> 27:21.172
HERE'S THE THING THOUGH, THAT

27:21.239 --> 27:22.007
DREAM SPEECH WAS CLEARLY AN

27:22.073 --> 27:22.507
ASPIRATIONAL GOAL, NOT A

27:22.574 --> 27:23.141
DESCRIPTION OF THINGS AS THEY

27:23.208 --> 27:23.541
STOOD.

27:23.608 --> 27:24.843
AND IN FACT, KING HIMSELF LATER

27:24.909 --> 27:25.977
PUT A PRETTY MAJOR ASTERISK ON

27:26.044 --> 27:27.412
IT.

27:27.479 --> 27:30.248
>> I MUST CONFESS THAT THAT

27:30.315 --> 27:32.917
DREAM I HAD THAT DAY HAS AT MANY

27:32.984 --> 27:34.552
POINTS TURNED INTO A NIGHTMARE.

27:34.619 --> 27:35.387
AND I'VE COME TO SEE THAT WE

27:35.453 --> 27:37.022
HAVE MANY MORE DIFFICULT DAYS

27:37.088 --> 27:38.089
AHEAD, AND SOME OF THE OLD

27:38.156 --> 27:41.693
OPTIMISM WAS A LITTLE

27:41.760 --> 27:43.161
SUPERFICIAL, AND NOW IT MUST BE

27:43.228 --> 27:48.967
TEMPERED WITH A SOLID REALISM.

27:49.034 --> 27:51.202
>> John: YEAH.

27:51.269 --> 27:52.537
AND IN A BOOK PUBLISHED THAT

27:52.604 --> 27:54.239
SAME YEAR, HE WROTE THAT, WHILE

27:54.305 --> 27:56.441
"THE MAJORITY OF WHITE AMERICANS

27:56.508 --> 27:58.109
CONSIDER THEMSELVES SINCERELY

27:58.176 --> 27:59.144
COMMITTED TO JUSTICE FOR THE

27:59.210 --> 28:00.045
NEGRO, AND THEY BELIEVE THAT

28:00.111 --> 28:00.745
AMERICAN SOCIETY IS ESSENTIALLY

28:00.812 --> 28:02.147
HOSPITABLE TO FAIR PLAY AND TO

28:02.213 --> 28:03.348
STEADY GROWTH TOWARD A

28:03.415 --> 28:04.983
MIDDLE-CLASS UTOPIA EMBODYING

28:05.050 --> 28:06.051
RACIAL HARMONY,

28:06.117 --> 28:08.253
UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS A FANTASY

28:08.319 --> 28:09.287
OF SELF-DECEPTION AND

28:09.354 --> 28:14.159
COMFORTABLE VANITY."

28:14.225 --> 28:15.693
SO WHILE IT IS CLEARLY VERY

28:15.760 --> 28:18.863
APPEALING TO CREATE A VERSION OF

28:18.930 --> 28:20.598
HISTORY WHERE MLK WAS A KIND

28:20.665 --> 28:22.167
FIGURE WHO EXISTED SOLELY TO

28:22.233 --> 28:23.735
HELP WHITE PEOPLE WIN ARGUMENTS,

28:23.802 --> 28:24.836
THE TRUTH IS, HE LATER REFLECTED

28:24.903 --> 28:26.538
ON HIS OWN MESSAGE, AND

28:26.604 --> 28:28.173
CHALLENGED WHITE PEOPLE TO LOOK

28:28.239 --> 28:28.740
MORE DEEPLY AT THEMSELVES.

28:28.807 --> 28:29.474
AND THAT IS SOMETHING KIDS

28:29.541 --> 28:30.075
SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE LEARNING

28:30.141 --> 28:31.476
ABOUT IN SCHOOL.

28:31.543 --> 28:32.377
BUT THE PROBLEM IS, THEY WON'T,

28:32.444 --> 28:35.713
IF THESE LAWS CONTINUE.

28:35.780 --> 28:36.548
A WHITE PARENT COULD PLAUSIBLY

28:36.614 --> 28:37.749
CLAIM THAT READING MLK'S

28:37.816 --> 28:38.917
WRITING MADE THEIR CHILD FEEL

28:38.983 --> 28:40.185
"DISCOMFORT" ON THE BASIS OF

28:40.251 --> 28:42.053
THEIR RACE.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.822
AND SOME OF THESE LAWS SEEM

28:43.888 --> 28:44.622
DESIGNED TO BEND SCHOOLS'

28:44.689 --> 28:46.324
CURRICULUMS TO THE SENSIBILITIES

28:46.391 --> 28:47.559
OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE,

28:47.625 --> 28:50.361
ALARMED PARENTS.

28:50.428 --> 28:52.230
IN FLORIDA, RON DeSANTIS IS

28:52.297 --> 28:53.531
PUSHING A "STOP WOKE" ACT --

28:53.598 --> 28:56.935
THAT WAS HIM UNVEILING IT A

28:57.001 --> 28:58.736
MINUTE AGO WITH CHRIS RUFO

28:58.803 --> 29:01.439
RIGHT BEHIND HIM.

29:01.506 --> 29:02.240
THAT WOULD GIVE PARENTS

29:02.307 --> 29:03.074
"PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION" TO SUE

29:03.141 --> 29:04.075
IF THEY THINK THEIR KIDS ARE

29:04.142 --> 29:05.710
BEING TAUGHT CRT.

29:05.777 --> 29:08.646
AND ALL OF THESE LAWS ARE

29:08.713 --> 29:09.647
ALREADY HAVING CHILLING EFFECTS.

29:09.714 --> 29:10.448
BOOK BANS ARE ON THE RISE AROUND

29:10.515 --> 29:11.316
THE COUNTRY, AND ONE OKLAHOMA

29:11.382 --> 29:12.217
SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS EVEN TOLD

29:12.283 --> 29:13.918
TEACHERS SIMPLY TO AVOID USING

29:13.985 --> 29:16.454
TERMS LIKE "DIVERSITY" AND

29:16.521 --> 29:18.022
"WHITE PRIVILEGE."

29:18.089 --> 29:20.425
AND LOOK -- YOU CAN BAN ALL THE

29:20.492 --> 29:24.529
BOOKS YOU WANT, YOU CAN TRY AND

29:24.596 --> 29:27.398
LEGISLATE IT AWAY, BUT AS ANY

29:27.465 --> 29:28.867
BLACK WOMAN ON "THE BACHELOR"

29:28.933 --> 29:30.602
CAN TELL YOU, TALKING ABOUT RACE

29:30.668 --> 29:30.969
IS UNAVOIDABLE.

29:31.035 --> 29:32.837
AND IT'S NOT JUST UNAVOIDABLE,

29:32.904 --> 29:33.938
IT'S ESSENTIAL-ESPECIALLY IN THE

29:34.005 --> 29:35.173
PLACES WHERE PEOPLE ARE MOST

29:35.240 --> 29:36.674
PANICKED ABOUT CRT.

29:36.741 --> 29:37.976
AND THIS BRINGS US ALL THE WAY

29:38.042 --> 29:40.612
BACK TO WHERE THIS STORY BEGAN,

29:40.678 --> 29:43.081
IN LOUDOUN COUNTY, VIRGINIA,

29:43.148 --> 29:47.018
WHERE THAT SCHOOL BOARD MEETING

29:47.085 --> 29:49.754
GOT SO VERY FAR OUT OF HAND.

29:49.821 --> 29:51.055
HERE IS ONE OF THE LEADERS OF

29:51.122 --> 29:52.557
THE ANTI-CRT PUSH THERE,

29:52.624 --> 29:53.892
EXPLAINING JUST WHY SHE'S SO

29:53.958 --> 29:54.492
FIERCELY OPPOSED TO IT BEING

29:54.559 --> 29:54.726
TAUGHT.

29:54.792 --> 29:55.760
>> IN LOUDOUN COUNTY, THIS IS

29:55.827 --> 29:56.327
THE WEALTHIEST COUNTY IN THE

29:56.394 --> 29:58.930
COUNTRY.

29:58.997 --> 30:03.001
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF RACISM.

30:03.067 --> 30:04.636
THERE ARE SILLY PEOPLE THAT SAY

30:04.702 --> 30:07.872
STUPID THINGS, BUT IF YOU TALK

30:07.939 --> 30:08.873
ABOUT IT LESS, YOU'RE GOING TO

30:08.940 --> 30:11.543
NOTICE THAT DIVISION LESS.

30:11.609 --> 30:12.810
I DON'T LOOK AT THE PERSON BASED

30:12.877 --> 30:13.611
ON THEIR SKIN COLOR, I LOOK AT

30:13.678 --> 30:15.613
THEM BASED ON THEIR CHARACTER.

30:15.680 --> 30:19.684
>> John: OKAY, THERE'S A LOT OF

30:19.751 --> 30:20.485
OBVIOUS RED FLAGS THERE, FROM

30:20.552 --> 30:21.319
CONFIDENTLY ASSERTING "THERE'S

30:21.386 --> 30:22.554
NOT A LOT OF RACISM HERE," TO

30:22.620 --> 30:24.856
THE "I DON'T SEE SKIN COLOR," TO

30:24.923 --> 30:26.291
THE "YOU WON'T NOTICE DIVISION

30:26.357 --> 30:26.891
SO MUCH IF YOU JUST DON'T TALK

30:26.958 --> 30:29.027
ABOUT IT."

30:29.093 --> 30:30.762
AND HEY, IF THE PROBLEM WITH

30:30.828 --> 30:31.863
RACISM IN AMERICA WAS ONLY "IT'S

30:31.930 --> 30:32.664
BUMMING PATTI MENDERS OUT," THEN

30:32.730 --> 30:33.765
YEAH, SHUTTING UP WOULD PROBABLY

30:33.831 --> 30:34.399
SOLVE THE ISSUE.

30:34.465 --> 30:36.301
BUT GUESS HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR

30:36.367 --> 30:38.970
THAT CONVERSATION TO TAKE A

30:39.037 --> 30:40.538
REAL TURN.

30:40.605 --> 30:42.807
>> I THINK THERE ARE A LOT

30:42.874 --> 30:43.441
OF, THERE -- THERE ARE PROBABLY

30:43.508 --> 30:44.142
PLENTY OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD

30:44.209 --> 30:44.642
AGREE WITH EXACTLY THAT.

30:44.709 --> 30:45.843
BUT JUST TO BE FAIR, ON THE

30:45.910 --> 30:46.744
OTHER SIDE, THERE ARE PEOPLE,

30:46.811 --> 30:47.845
ESPECIALLY YOUNG BLACK MEN, FOR

30:47.912 --> 30:49.714
EXAMPLE, WHO WOULD SAY, "I WOULD

30:49.781 --> 30:50.615
LOVE TO NOT BE JUDGED ON THE

30:50.682 --> 30:51.816
COLOR OF MY SKIN.

30:51.883 --> 30:52.750
>> DO YOU THINK IT'S MORE ON THE

30:52.817 --> 30:53.751
COLOR OF THEIR SKIN OR THEIR

30:53.818 --> 30:56.321
ACTIONS?

30:56.387 --> 30:57.689
HOW THEY'RE DRESSED, HOW THEY

30:57.755 --> 30:59.791
PERCEIVE, HOW THEY RESPECT

30:59.857 --> 31:02.026
OTHERS?

31:02.093 --> 31:03.127
IF YOU HAVE A KID THAT'S PULLED

31:03.194 --> 31:03.861
OVER BY A COP, DOES IT REALLY

31:03.928 --> 31:04.729
MATTER WHAT COLOR THEY ARE, OR

31:04.796 --> 31:05.863
IS -- IS IT THE RESPECT THAT

31:05.930 --> 31:08.433
THEY GIVE TO THAT POLICE

31:08.499 --> 31:09.534
OFFICER?

31:09.601 --> 31:10.602
>> John: WOW.

31:10.668 --> 31:11.869
WHEN YOU RESPOND TO SOMEONE

31:11.936 --> 31:12.704
MENTIONING YOUNG BLACK MEN WOULD

31:12.770 --> 31:15.340
LIKE TO BE TREATED BETTER BY

31:15.406 --> 31:17.575
AUTOMATICALLY ENVISIONING THEM

31:17.642 --> 31:18.610
DRESSED TERRIBLY AND ACTING

31:18.676 --> 31:20.345
DISRESPECTFULLY, WHILE BEING

31:20.411 --> 31:21.179
ARRESTED BY THE POLICE, YOU ARE

31:21.246 --> 31:22.880
TELLING ON YOURSELF, PATTY.

31:22.947 --> 31:23.581
YOU ARE SNITCHING ON YOUR OWN

31:23.648 --> 31:28.853
SOUL.

31:28.920 --> 31:29.654
AND AS FOR HER CLAIM THAT

31:29.721 --> 31:30.288
THERE'S "NOT A LOT OF RACISM" IN

31:30.355 --> 31:31.589
LOUDOUN COUNTY, YOU PROBABLY

31:31.656 --> 31:34.058
ALREADY ASSUMED THAT WAS

31:34.125 --> 31:34.826
BULLSHIT, BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW,

31:34.892 --> 31:36.494
AN ASSESSMENT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS

31:36.561 --> 31:36.995
THERE FOUND THAT "IT WAS

31:37.061 --> 31:37.762
SHOCKING THE EXTENT TO WHICH

31:37.829 --> 31:38.363
STUDENTS REPORT THE USE OF THE

31:38.429 --> 31:40.798
N-WORD."

31:40.865 --> 31:42.267
AND I THINK, AS A SOCIETY, WE'VE

31:42.333 --> 31:44.802
AGREED: WHITE PEOPLE SHOULD NOT

31:44.869 --> 31:47.739
BE USING THE N-WORD A "SHOCKING

31:47.805 --> 31:48.439
NUMBER OF TIMES" -- UNLESS, THAT

31:48.506 --> 31:48.973
IS, THEY HAVE A LUCRATIVE

31:49.040 --> 31:51.709
PODCAST DEAL WITH SPOTIFY.

31:51.776 --> 31:52.877
BUT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY IT.

31:52.944 --> 31:54.345
AND ALL OF THIS BRINGS US TO THE

31:54.412 --> 31:56.080
MAIN POINT HERE -- THAT FOR ALL

31:56.147 --> 31:56.981
THE LAWS BEING PASSED TO PREVENT

31:57.048 --> 31:58.950
DISCOMFORT OR ANGUISH ON ACCOUNT

31:59.017 --> 31:59.884
OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S RACE, WHOSE

31:59.951 --> 32:04.622
DISCOMFORT, EXACTLY, ARE WE

32:04.689 --> 32:06.257
PRIORITIZING HERE?

32:06.324 --> 32:07.292
BECAUSE KIDS OF COLOR CAN TELL

32:07.358 --> 32:08.459
YOU, THEY DON'T GET A CHOICE TO

32:08.526 --> 32:09.494
"NOT TALK ABOUT RACE" AND HAVE

32:09.560 --> 32:12.530
IT GO AWAY, LIKE THIS GRADUATE

32:12.597 --> 32:13.998
OF LOUDOUN COUNTY SCHOOLS:

32:14.065 --> 32:15.033
>> I DO UNDERSTAND THAT MANY

32:15.099 --> 32:16.334
PARENTS DON'T WANT THEIR

32:16.401 --> 32:17.835
CHILDREN LEARNING ABOUT RACE AT

32:17.902 --> 32:18.770
SUCH A YOUNG AGE, BUT I BEG TO

32:18.836 --> 32:19.871
DIFFER IN THAT SENSE.

32:19.937 --> 32:21.639
WE LEARN ABOUT RACE EVERY DAY

32:21.706 --> 32:22.707
WHEN WE'RE THE ONLY COLORED KID

32:22.774 --> 32:23.941
IN OUR CLASSROOMS, OR WHEN WE'RE

32:24.008 --> 32:24.809
LEARNING ABOUT SLAVERY AND ALL

32:24.876 --> 32:27.078
THE HEADS TURN TO US.

32:27.145 --> 32:28.746
SO ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, ONE GROUP

32:28.813 --> 32:29.914
OF STUDENTS WILL LEARN ABOUT

32:29.981 --> 32:31.215
RACE BEFORE ANOTHER.

32:31.282 --> 32:32.250
SO WE BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE

32:32.317 --> 32:33.985
EQUITABLE IF ALL STUDENTS TO

32:34.052 --> 32:35.586
LEARN ABOUT RACE IN THE SAME

32:35.653 --> 32:36.354
CONTEXT SO THAT WE CAN WORK

32:36.421 --> 32:37.088
TOGETHER ON IT TO IMPROVE OUR

32:37.155 --> 32:38.823
FUTURE.

32:38.890 --> 32:39.991
>> John: YEAH, CHILDREN OF COLOR

32:40.058 --> 32:42.160
LEARN ABOUT RACE FROM A VERY

32:42.226 --> 32:43.895
YOUNG AGE.

32:43.961 --> 32:44.929
FROM REALIZING YOU CELEBRATE

32:44.996 --> 32:45.863
DIFFERENT HOLIDAYS OR GET

32:45.930 --> 32:46.898
DIFFERENT SAFETY TALKS OR THE

32:46.964 --> 32:47.765
FIRST TIME YOU GO TO A WHITE

32:47.832 --> 32:48.900
FRIEND'S HOUSE AND YOU'RE SERVED

32:48.966 --> 32:50.468
A CASSEROLE.

32:50.535 --> 32:53.371
YOU REALIZE VERY QUICKLY IN THAT

32:53.438 --> 32:55.440
MOMENT THAT WE ARE DIFFERENT

32:55.506 --> 32:57.642
PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT CULTURES.

32:57.709 --> 32:58.309
SO, LOOK, BY THIS POINT, IT

32:58.376 --> 32:59.043
SHOULD BE PRETTY CLEAR THE

32:59.110 --> 32:59.610
DEBATE AROUND CRITICAL RACE

32:59.677 --> 33:00.545
THEORY IS BOTH VERY LOUD AND

33:00.611 --> 33:03.614
VERY, VERY DUMB.

33:03.681 --> 33:05.650
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS

33:05.717 --> 33:06.584
IMPORTANT TO ENGAGE WITH IT.

33:06.651 --> 33:07.852
BECAUSE IF WE DON'T, THE

33:07.919 --> 33:08.486
ENDPOINT WE'RE HEADING TOWARD IS

33:08.553 --> 33:10.521
THAT HONEST DISCUSSIONS OF RACE

33:10.588 --> 33:11.989
WILL BE SHUT OUT OF PUBLIC

33:12.056 --> 33:13.524
SCHOOLS, EVEN AS SOME PARENTS

33:13.591 --> 33:14.992
FUCK OFF TO VOUCHER ACADEMIES

33:15.059 --> 33:15.727
WHERE THEIR KIDS CAN LEARN A

33:15.793 --> 33:16.828
VERSION OF HISTORY THAT'S

33:16.894 --> 33:19.364
BASICALLY ANTEBELLUM

33:19.430 --> 33:20.131
FAN FICTION.

33:20.198 --> 33:21.065
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT

33:21.132 --> 33:22.200
DISCUSSIONS ON RACE WILL ALWAYS

33:22.266 --> 33:25.837
BE COMFORTABLE FOR EVERYONE IN

33:25.903 --> 33:28.673
THE CLASSROOM, BUT THINK ABOUT

33:28.740 --> 33:29.640
IT LIKE THIS, WHEN WAS LEARNING

33:29.707 --> 33:30.608
AND GROWING AS A PERSON EVER

33:30.675 --> 33:31.743
COMFORTABLE?

33:31.809 --> 33:32.910
THE THING TO DO HERE ISN'T TO

33:32.977 --> 33:34.479
RUN FROM THOSE DISCUSSIONS OR

33:34.545 --> 33:36.180
PASS LAWS BANNING THEM.

33:36.247 --> 33:37.081
IT IS TO LEARN HOW TO HAVE THEM

33:37.148 --> 33:38.816
BETTER.

33:38.883 --> 33:40.418
BECAUSE FOR GENERATION AFTER

33:40.485 --> 33:41.786
GENERATION, WE'VE TOLD

33:41.853 --> 33:42.687
SCHOOLKIDS FAIRY TALES ABOUT

33:42.754 --> 33:43.821
RACE IN THIS COUNTRY.

33:43.888 --> 33:46.157
AND MAYBE IT'S TIME WE STOP

33:46.224 --> 33:48.459
DOING THAT.

33:48.526 --> 33:49.293
BECAUSE ALL IT'S DONE SO FAR IS

33:49.360 --> 33:50.128
GET US TO THE POINT WE'RE AT

33:50.194 --> 33:51.529
RIGHT NOW, WITH FULL-GROWN

33:51.596 --> 33:54.031
ADULTS INSISTING AMERICA CAN'T

33:54.098 --> 33:55.566
BE RACIST BECAUSE WE ELECTED

33:55.633 --> 33:57.001
OBAMA TWICE, THAT RACISM WILL GO

33:57.068 --> 33:57.769
AWAY IF WE JUST DON'T MENTION

33:57.835 --> 33:58.870
IT, AND THAT MARTIN LUTHER

33:58.936 --> 34:00.905
KING'S "I HAVE A DREAM" SPEECH

34:00.972 --> 34:04.275
WASN'T AN ASPIRATION WE HAVE YET

34:04.342 --> 34:05.343
TO FULFILL, BUT SOME KIND OF

34:05.410 --> 34:06.110
MAGIC SPELL THAT ENDED PREJUDICE

34:06.177 --> 34:07.145
THEN AND THERE.

34:21.826 --> 34:22.493
FREED SLAVES HEADING WEST TO

IN SIXTH GRADE, I TOLD MY

34:28.399 --> 34:29.100
TEACHER THAT READING

34:29.167 --> 34:30.568
"ROLL OF THUNDER, HEAR MY CRY"

34:30.635 --> 34:31.669
MADE ME UNCOMFORTABLE, AND SHE

34:31.736 --> 34:32.403
TOLD ME, IT ALL WORKS OUT IN THE

34:32.470 --> 34:33.137

34:41.779 --> 34:42.580

34:43.748 --> 34:44.549
MY TEACHER SAID, WELL, GUESS.

34:44.615 --> 34:46.417
