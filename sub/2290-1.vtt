04:02.185 --> 04:04.187
Forgive me, Consul Han...

04:04.187 --> 04:07.309
but I believe
we can ill afford...

04:07.350 --> 04:10.312
to lose men
of your high character.

04:10.392 --> 04:12.754
And speaking as a friend...

04:12.794 --> 04:16.277
who's fought side by side
with you for 15 years...

04:16.317 --> 04:18.719
I will sorely miss
the unshakable support...

04:18.760 --> 04:20.641
you've given
the Royal Hong Kong Police.

04:20.680 --> 04:23.964
So, on behalf of all Brits...

04:24.004 --> 04:26.286
who have ever carried the shield
in Hong Kong...

04:26.326 --> 04:27.607
we shall miss you.

04:27.647 --> 04:29.409
We wish you nothing
but happiness...

04:29.449 --> 04:31.971
as you take up your new post
in the United States.

04:32.011 --> 04:35.013
Ladies and gentlemen,
Consul Han.

04:36.374 --> 04:37.816
Thank you, Thomas.

04:41.539 --> 04:45.662
You know Thomas is not going
to make this evening easy.

04:45.703 --> 04:46.864
Excuse me.

04:53.669 --> 04:54.871
Commander Griffin...

04:54.911 --> 04:57.593
I am pleased to be able
to leave you and Hong Kong...

04:57.633 --> 04:59.835
with a special gift tonight.

04:59.875 --> 05:02.437
Earlier this evening,
Detective inspector Lee...

05:02.477 --> 05:05.239
and his special task force
have once and for all...

05:05.280 --> 05:07.041
crushed the Juntao
criminal organization...

05:07.081 --> 05:09.002
and reclaimed artifacts...

05:09.042 --> 05:11.604
from 5,000 years
of China's heritage.

05:14.288 --> 05:15.728
Thank you.

05:17.369 --> 05:19.811
This is the kind of legacy
I dreamt about.

05:20.492 --> 05:22.014
Hong Kong forever.

05:22.054 --> 05:24.576
To Hong Kong forever.

05:31.862 --> 05:33.024
Soo Yung.

06:12.056 --> 06:13.538
Stupid fool!

06:13.578 --> 06:17.101
Get the hell out of my way!
Man, are you crazy?

06:17.141 --> 06:18.262
Shoot!

06:18.302 --> 06:19.544
You moron!

06:25.668 --> 06:28.190
Clive, what's up, man?

06:28.230 --> 06:30.353
You're late.

06:30.393 --> 06:32.274
-I'm late?
-Yeah, you're late.

06:32.314 --> 06:35.677
I've been waiting
in the back for over an hour.

06:35.717 --> 06:38.279
-I was in the diner.
-I told you in the back.

06:38.320 --> 06:40.481
Think I would do this shit
out front?

06:40.521 --> 06:43.163
-I'm gonna get busted.
-You weren't in the diner.

06:43.204 --> 06:45.565
I said in the back--
It don't even matter.

06:45.605 --> 06:49.009
Let's do this.
What's that, a gun?

06:49.049 --> 06:50.970
How many people
you killed this year?

06:51.010 --> 06:53.572
Stop it, man.
Let's do it. Come on.

06:53.612 --> 06:54.774
Don't be late again.

06:54.814 --> 06:56.855
I ain't gonna be late.
What we got?

06:58.656 --> 07:00.339
That's tight.

07:00.379 --> 07:03.061
That's beautiful. That's nice.
What's that?

07:03.101 --> 07:06.183
-That's C-4.
-That's C-4?

07:06.223 --> 07:08.546
-Oh, shit.
-What's the problem?

07:08.585 --> 07:11.188
No problem. I been looking
everywhere for this shit.

07:11.228 --> 07:14.830
How the hell you find some C-4?

07:14.870 --> 07:17.112
The Iraqis
can't even get this shit.

07:17.152 --> 07:18.794
Where'd you get this from?

07:18.834 --> 07:20.115
It's a hot ticket.

07:20.155 --> 07:22.236
You don't know how happy
you made me.

07:22.276 --> 07:24.800
You got what I want.
Let me get that money.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.080
Step away from the car.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.282
Hey, officers.

07:28.322 --> 07:31.204
Put your hands above your heads.
Just do it now.

07:31.244 --> 07:34.247
Ain't no problem here.
Why y'all messing with us for?

07:34.287 --> 07:36.208
All right, take it easy.

07:36.249 --> 07:38.251
-You don't wanna do that.
-Yes, I do.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.053
-No, he don't. He's playing.
-No, I ain't playing.

07:41.093 --> 07:43.455
-Yes, he is, officer.
-I'm not playing!

07:43.495 --> 07:44.616
Drop the gun!

07:44.696 --> 07:46.458
He's just my cousin.
We're just talking.

07:46.498 --> 07:47.979
Get in your car and leave.

07:48.019 --> 07:49.381
We can't do that.

07:49.420 --> 07:51.823
I'll blow his head
all over the parking lot!

07:51.863 --> 07:53.223
Go away and buy some doughnuts!

07:53.263 --> 07:54.665
See? You made him mad.

07:54.705 --> 07:56.867
Let me talk to him.
All right?

07:57.867 --> 07:59.109
Don't move!

07:59.149 --> 08:01.791
All right.
Everything's cool now.

08:01.831 --> 08:05.074
He down. The gun's down.
Get back in the car and leave.

08:05.114 --> 08:06.234
Hands on your head!

08:06.274 --> 08:07.996
Everything's cool, officer.

08:08.036 --> 08:09.237
Do it now!

08:28.894 --> 08:30.176
Didn't I tell you?

08:51.153 --> 08:53.715
Stop it! I got C-4 in the trunk!

09:20.618 --> 09:23.261
Clive, guess what, man.

09:23.301 --> 09:26.223
I forgot to tell you.
I'm LAPD.

09:26.223 --> 09:27.584
You under arrest.

09:32.469 --> 09:35.432
Soo Yung, come on,
we're gonna be late.

09:35.472 --> 09:37.273
Let's go.

09:37.313 --> 09:39.194
Excuse me.

09:40.195 --> 09:41.316
What?

09:41.356 --> 09:43.318
Telephone. China.

09:46.241 --> 09:49.883
Soo Yung, I love you.
Have a nice day.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.686
Will you be home after school?

09:53.246 --> 09:56.650
I am going to pick you up
myself.

10:26.435 --> 10:28.917
When you walk by every night...

10:28.957 --> 10:31.079
talkin' sweet
and lookin' fine...

10:31.119 --> 10:35.083
I become hectic inside.

10:35.123 --> 10:38.124
Baby, I'm so into you.

10:38.124 --> 10:40.648
Darlin', if you only knew...

10:40.688 --> 10:43.849
all the things
that float through my mind.

11:05.588 --> 11:06.870
Is there a problem, officer?

11:06.910 --> 11:09.191
No problem.

11:09.232 --> 11:10.713
Just rush hour.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.921
Security's in place?

12:07.962 --> 12:10.964
You're sure all of the exhibits
will be ready by this weekend?

12:11.044 --> 12:14.287
Yes, sir. Your opening remarks
are scheduled for 7:30.

12:14.327 --> 12:16.970
Excuse me, Consul Han.

12:17.010 --> 12:20.613
I'm Warren Russ with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

12:20.653 --> 12:22.614
This is Agent Whitney.

12:22.655 --> 12:24.416
We need to speak with you
in private.

12:27.018 --> 12:28.179
Excuse me.

12:35.866 --> 12:38.388
I know this is a difficult time
for you, Consul...

12:38.428 --> 12:40.830
but be assured
we'll get your daughter back.

12:40.870 --> 12:42.512
But will you get her back alive?

12:42.552 --> 12:46.034
We have the best agents
in the world on those streets.

12:47.156 --> 12:50.158
I would like
one of my people to help.

12:50.198 --> 12:54.161
Let me assure you, the FBI
considers this a top priority.

12:54.201 --> 12:56.484
We have plenty of people
on the case.

12:56.524 --> 12:59.366
Mr. Russ, I am not an American.

12:59.407 --> 13:01.448
My daughter is not an American.

13:01.528 --> 13:02.769
I understand that, sir--

13:02.809 --> 13:05.171
He's already on the plane.

13:05.211 --> 13:07.654
I trust you will treat him
with the same courtesy...

13:07.694 --> 13:09.655
as you have shown me.

13:13.818 --> 13:15.300
Ten people
jumped out of the trunk.

13:15.340 --> 13:18.183
I started handling all of them.
Throwing them everywhere.

13:18.223 --> 13:20.184
Then two stupid cops
came out of nowhere...

13:20.224 --> 13:22.185
messed everything up,
but then I regrouped.

13:22.226 --> 13:23.707
I had to save their life.

13:23.747 --> 13:25.869
It ain't in there.
Anyway, I save their life.

13:25.909 --> 13:27.870
I start runnin',
trying to get the bomb--

13:27.951 --> 13:30.633
I can't believe
you went without me.

13:30.673 --> 13:32.354
I'll talk to y'all later,
all right?

13:32.394 --> 13:34.517
I'll tell you the best part
after work.

13:34.557 --> 13:36.478
This is why nobody
will work with you...

13:36.518 --> 13:39.761
why you're the only cop in the
department without a partner.

13:39.801 --> 13:42.924
Johnson, look, first of all,
if you want a date with me...

13:42.964 --> 13:45.526
you have to wait on the list
like every other woman, OK?

13:45.566 --> 13:47.648
Second of all, I work alone.

13:47.688 --> 13:50.730
I don't need no partner
and ain't never gonna have one.

13:50.770 --> 13:53.172
-Did Kojak have a partner?
-Yeah. The fat guy.

13:53.172 --> 13:55.334
He wasn't never with him.
Did Columbo?

13:55.374 --> 13:57.376
Captain Diel ordered me
to go with you...

13:57.376 --> 14:00.178
because you needed bomb squad
backup, but once again...

14:00.178 --> 14:01.740
you screwed me and yourself.

14:01.780 --> 14:03.421
Look, Johnson,
it's dangerous out there.

14:03.461 --> 14:05.783
It's safer for you
to be behind the desk.

14:05.823 --> 14:08.385
We were supposed to be
on the same team.

14:08.425 --> 14:10.787
Team?
Johnson, this is the LAPD...

14:10.827 --> 14:12.950
the most hated cops
in the free world.

14:12.990 --> 14:14.631
My own mama ashamed of me.

14:14.671 --> 14:16.512
She tell everybody
I'm a drug dealer.

14:16.552 --> 14:18.314
This is a pit stop for me.

14:18.354 --> 14:20.155
I'm on the verge of leaving
you suckers behind.

14:20.196 --> 14:22.878
Actually, you're on the verge
of being suspended.

14:22.918 --> 14:24.118
Have a nice day.

14:30.484 --> 14:32.205
Somebody told you
I was being suspended?

14:33.847 --> 14:35.648
Quit playin', girl.

14:37.290 --> 14:39.132
I know you playin'.

14:40.412 --> 14:42.375
Somebody told you
I was being suspended?

14:45.057 --> 14:47.259
This is a problem.
That's all I need...

14:47.299 --> 14:49.020
some foreigner
getting his head blown off...

14:49.060 --> 14:50.742
and creating
an international incident.

14:50.782 --> 14:53.024
What can we do?
He's on his way.

14:54.945 --> 14:57.187
Call the field office.
Have them send over a rookie.

14:57.227 --> 14:59.709
We'll have him escort this guy
around a few days...

14:59.749 --> 15:02.191
pretend to follow some leads,
show him some sights...

15:02.231 --> 15:03.633
keep him out of our way.

15:03.673 --> 15:05.915
You want to do that
to one of men?

15:05.955 --> 15:07.716
What do you suggest?

15:09.478 --> 15:12.921
Well, as long as we're
gonna humiliate someone...

15:12.960 --> 15:14.963
might as well be LAPD.

15:17.405 --> 15:18.845
Even if I had an extra man...

15:18.885 --> 15:21.488
who would want
such a bullshit assignment?

15:21.528 --> 15:23.290
Well, it's a disgrace to me.

15:23.330 --> 15:25.291
It's a disgrace
to my department.

15:25.291 --> 15:26.572
It's a disgrace to--

15:28.454 --> 15:31.817
Dan, I'm sending someone
right over.

15:34.819 --> 15:38.102
Captain, I know you read
the paper, but they lying.

15:38.142 --> 15:39.544
I wouldn't do nothing like that.

15:39.584 --> 15:42.386
You know how the paper is.
They just want a story.

15:42.426 --> 15:45.269
Two officers were shot.
One man lost a pinkie.

15:45.309 --> 15:46.589
But didn't nobody die.

15:46.629 --> 15:49.432
-You destroyed half a block.
-That block was messed up.

15:49.472 --> 15:51.954
-You lost lots of evidence.
-We got a little left.

15:51.954 --> 15:55.037
What you did was dangerous
and completely against policy.

15:55.077 --> 15:57.879
And not only that...

15:57.919 --> 15:59.600
you did a good job.

16:00.722 --> 16:01.922
What?

16:01.962 --> 16:04.125
Everyone around here
is so image-conscious.

16:04.165 --> 16:06.687
Everybody's so afraid
of their own goddamn shadow.

16:06.727 --> 16:08.929
It's nice to meet
an L.A. detective...

16:08.969 --> 16:11.491
who's willing to lay it
on the line.

16:11.531 --> 16:14.934
Captain,
that's the same way I feel.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.856
That's what I've been trying
to tell everybody.

16:16.896 --> 16:19.778
Every so often, we have to let
the general public know...

16:19.818 --> 16:21.619
that we can still blow shit up.

16:21.659 --> 16:24.702
You goddamn right.
That's the only way I work.

16:24.742 --> 16:26.344
So that mean
I ain't gettin' suspended?

16:26.384 --> 16:28.866
-Are you kidding?
-Don't know why I said that.

16:28.906 --> 16:30.828
I just got a call from the FBI.

16:30.868 --> 16:32.949
The 10-year-old daughter
of a Chinese diplomat...

16:32.989 --> 16:36.152
was kidnapped this morning,
and they want you on the case.

16:36.192 --> 16:37.473
FBI want me?

16:37.513 --> 16:38.955
That's right.

16:38.995 --> 16:41.116
-Stop lying.
-I don't lie.

16:41.156 --> 16:42.837
-Tell the truth.
-I'm telling the truth.

16:44.039 --> 16:45.960
Thank you, Captain.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.163
Congratulations, Carter.
You are going to the show.

16:49.203 --> 16:51.765
I'll look out for you
when I reach the top.

16:51.805 --> 16:54.448
-I'm gonna make you mayor.
-I'd rather you didn't.

16:56.769 --> 17:00.213
Hey, listen up!
lf anybody need me...

17:00.253 --> 17:04.136
I'm gonna be workin'
a big, big case for the FBI!

17:20.869 --> 17:22.791
Yo. Take care of that for me.

17:36.644 --> 17:40.647
I need one of those earpieces
immediately, all right?

17:40.687 --> 17:42.089
Hey, how you doing?

17:42.129 --> 17:44.971
I want the consul's personnel
records cross-checked...

17:45.012 --> 17:47.494
with that new list
we received from Interpol.

17:47.494 --> 17:50.296
See if you can make
any matches or connections.

17:50.336 --> 17:52.297
OK, boys, what have we got?

17:52.338 --> 17:54.299
Have we checked the consul
personnel records yet?

17:54.339 --> 17:56.741
I want to know
who's he been talking with.

17:56.781 --> 17:58.423
OK, come on. Give me the story.

17:58.463 --> 18:01.065
Any demands? Any fingerprints?
Have we interviewed his staff?

18:01.105 --> 18:03.707
Whitney, who is this?

18:04.868 --> 18:06.550
Give me a copy of that.

18:06.590 --> 18:08.551
James Carter, FBI.

18:08.591 --> 18:11.434
Warren, he's here
for the special assignment.

18:13.756 --> 18:16.278
I'm Agent-In-Charge Warren Russ.

18:16.318 --> 18:18.800
It's good to have you onboard.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.242
I waited a long time for this.

18:20.282 --> 18:23.124
You guys sure take a long time
to process an application.

18:23.164 --> 18:26.727
Well, Carter,
your particular assignment...

18:26.767 --> 18:29.249
is considered G-14 classified.

18:29.289 --> 18:34.733
Why don't you and I take a walk
and I'll fill you in?

18:34.774 --> 18:36.015
OK, Warren.

18:41.500 --> 18:43.581
G-14 classified.

18:43.621 --> 18:45.262
That's good.

18:45.302 --> 18:47.425
You don't understand.
This is my dream.

18:47.465 --> 18:49.426
I'm very excited
about working with the FBI.

18:49.467 --> 18:52.429
I'm glad.
Listen, his name is Lee.

18:52.469 --> 18:55.111
And the director considers
this a top priority.

18:55.151 --> 18:57.954
No disrespect, but he's only
gonna get in my way.

18:57.994 --> 18:59.435
I'm not used
to having a partner.

18:59.475 --> 19:02.397
If I'm handling the situation,
I'm gonna have to work alone.

19:02.437 --> 19:04.719
Carter, he is the situation.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.361
Must be a misunderstanding.

19:07.402 --> 19:10.564
I was sent down here for
the kidnapping. Little girl?

19:10.604 --> 19:13.086
Forget the little girl.
Your assignment is Lee.

19:14.608 --> 19:16.410
Who and what kind of assignment
is that?

19:16.450 --> 19:19.893
Lee is a foreign detective
and a friend of the consul's.

19:19.933 --> 19:23.575
It's your job to keep him out
of sight and away from danger.

19:24.777 --> 19:27.900
Yeah, you want me to baby-sit,
but I don't do that.

19:27.940 --> 19:29.901
I came down here
for the big assignment.

19:29.941 --> 19:31.903
The truth is,
this is an FBI operation...

19:31.943 --> 19:35.906
and I don't need help from LAPD
or some Chun-King cop.

19:35.946 --> 19:37.427
You got it?

19:38.429 --> 19:39.829
Whoa. Hold it.

19:39.869 --> 19:42.351
Why not use your men
for this top-priority case?

19:42.391 --> 19:44.754
What am I supposed to do,
take him to the zoo?

19:44.794 --> 19:45.955
I don't give a damn.

19:45.995 --> 19:48.797
I don't want to see him
or you till this is resolved.

19:48.837 --> 19:51.279
Now, his plane arrives
in an hour.

19:51.279 --> 19:53.922
We want to make
a good impression, Carter.

19:53.962 --> 19:56.243
It's his first trip to America.

19:57.445 --> 19:59.406
This is bullshit!

20:39.520 --> 20:41.242
Please tell me
you speak English.

20:42.843 --> 20:45.125
I'm Detective Carter!

20:45.165 --> 20:47.568
Do you speaka any English?

20:50.930 --> 20:54.894
Do you understand the words
that are coming out of my mouth?

21:00.379 --> 21:02.901
I cannot believe this shit!

21:02.941 --> 21:04.902
First,
I get a bullshit assignment...

21:04.983 --> 21:06.784
now, Mr. Rice-A-Roni...

21:08.466 --> 21:09.947
don't even speak American.

21:11.148 --> 21:13.110
Come on. My ride's over here.

21:15.872 --> 21:17.394
Put your bag in the back.

21:21.997 --> 21:25.641
Put your bag in the back!

21:28.003 --> 21:31.445
No. You put your own shit
in the back!

21:31.485 --> 21:33.447
I am not a skycap.

21:33.488 --> 21:35.649
I'm FBI, you understand?

21:38.171 --> 21:40.173
What the hell you think this is?

21:44.257 --> 21:46.458
Captain, I don't think
this is funny.

21:46.498 --> 21:48.460
No, I'm serious, Captain.
I ain't playin'.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.421
Tell the FBI you made a mistake.

21:50.461 --> 21:51.983
I can't do that, Carter.

21:52.023 --> 21:56.026
I'm sure that you and Mr. Lee
will have a nice time together.

21:56.066 --> 21:59.830
You better call the FBI or
I drop his ass at Panda Express.

21:59.870 --> 22:03.033
Drop this case, you're suspended
for two months without pay.

22:03.073 --> 22:06.196
Well, you can forget
about being mayor then.

22:06.236 --> 22:07.917
Congratulations, Carter.

22:07.957 --> 22:10.439
Looks like you finally
got yourself a partner.

22:13.482 --> 22:16.684
One little pinkie get blowed off
and everybody trippin'.

22:18.285 --> 22:20.407
Chinese consul?

22:21.488 --> 22:23.770
That's one of the places
you can't go.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.611
I ain't getting fired.
You gonna pay my bills?

22:27.494 --> 22:28.854
That's the little girl?

22:30.977 --> 22:32.578
Say something.

22:33.979 --> 22:35.621
Y'all think this is real funny.

22:35.661 --> 22:38.944
Give Carter
the big G-14 classified case.

22:38.984 --> 22:41.945
Gonna show the FBI they don't
know who they playing with.

22:41.985 --> 22:43.908
I'll solve this case myself.

22:43.908 --> 22:45.228
That's right.

22:55.318 --> 22:58.480
But I wanna show you something
first. Look familiar?

22:58.520 --> 23:01.482
Just like home, ain't it?

23:01.522 --> 23:04.926
I ain't never been to China,
but it probably look like this.

23:04.926 --> 23:06.327
Get your star maps!

23:06.367 --> 23:08.929
Look, John Wayne.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.572
You know John Wayne?

23:11.612 --> 23:12.812
John Wayne.

23:12.852 --> 23:15.094
Yeah, John Wayne, man.
Hang out with the Duke.

23:15.134 --> 23:16.576
I'll be right back.

23:16.616 --> 23:18.417
You might see
one of your cousins here.

23:18.457 --> 23:21.179
Find them and stalk 'em !

23:21.220 --> 23:22.421
Star maps!

23:22.461 --> 23:24.422
Right here! Star maps!

23:24.463 --> 23:25.743
Stucky.

23:25.783 --> 23:29.587
You got the address
to Michael Jackson's house?

23:29.627 --> 23:32.109
You can't come around my job!
That's harassment!

23:32.149 --> 23:33.350
I'm just checking up on you.

23:33.390 --> 23:36.273
I'm fully legit now.
I'm selling star maps.

23:36.313 --> 23:37.473
Yeah, legit my ass.

23:37.514 --> 23:41.197
You and your Asian gang friends
know about a kidnapping?

23:41.237 --> 23:42.718
I don't know nothing.

23:42.758 --> 23:45.440
Give me one of them star maps...

23:45.480 --> 23:47.402
for $45, you understand
what I'm saying?

23:47.442 --> 23:49.925
Don't know nothin'
about no kidnapping...

23:50.004 --> 23:53.447
but this dude's buying firearms,
explosives, and people...

23:53.487 --> 23:55.129
Like he's gonna start a war.

23:55.169 --> 23:57.131
What's his name?

23:57.171 --> 23:59.012
For $45, I don't know his name.

23:59.052 --> 24:01.974
-You better tell me something.
-I don't know nothing for $45.

24:02.015 --> 24:03.096
Stucky, you don't--

24:04.617 --> 24:06.538
I didn't tell you nothin'!

24:50.296 --> 24:51.938
Didn't I tell you
to wait for me?

24:52.978 --> 24:54.940
What the hell you doing
on this bus?

24:56.501 --> 25:00.425
Think I'm playin' with you?

25:00.505 --> 25:02.907
I ain't playin' with you.
Sit down.

25:02.907 --> 25:04.548
OK. All right.

25:04.588 --> 25:06.229
It's OK.

25:06.269 --> 25:08.512
It's all right. FBI.

25:09.672 --> 25:11.634
Take a picture. It's OK.
Wait a minute.

25:18.921 --> 25:20.602
All right.

25:20.642 --> 25:22.244
What?

25:22.284 --> 25:23.605
Get out of my way!

25:30.690 --> 25:31.892
FBI. Stop this bus.

25:41.460 --> 25:42.941
Hey, look.

25:44.143 --> 25:47.104
Hey, kids, get back in here.
Sit down.

25:55.151 --> 25:57.314
Stop! FBI!
I need this motorcycle.

25:57.354 --> 25:59.916
-No way, man.
-Get off!

26:25.257 --> 26:28.220
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car now!

26:28.260 --> 26:29.742
Where you think you're going?

26:29.782 --> 26:31.703
Didn't I say
to stay by the Duke?

26:31.743 --> 26:33.344
What do you think you're doing?

26:33.384 --> 26:35.787
Mind your own business.
Stay in the car.

26:35.827 --> 26:37.388
Hey. What you doing?

26:37.428 --> 26:39.950
I was trying to find out
where you was going.

26:40.030 --> 26:41.431
You thought
I was gonna shoot you?

26:41.431 --> 26:43.193
What's happening here?

26:44.434 --> 26:45.915
Put the gun down.

26:45.955 --> 26:47.837
I ain't playin' with you!

26:47.877 --> 26:49.238
Think I'm playin' with you?

26:49.238 --> 26:50.519
Don't move!

26:52.641 --> 26:53.962
Drop your guns.

26:54.803 --> 26:56.564
Hey, man.

26:56.604 --> 26:58.446
Look. FBI.

26:58.486 --> 26:59.928
I'm policeman.

26:59.968 --> 27:03.090
I'm just showing him how
to take a gun from a suspect.

27:04.852 --> 27:06.813
All of a sudden
you speaking English?

27:06.853 --> 27:07.974
A little.

27:08.014 --> 27:09.375
My ass. You lied to me.

27:09.415 --> 27:11.377
I didn't say I didn't.
You assumed so.

27:11.417 --> 27:13.860
Assume I kick you little
Beijing ass right now.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.380
Man, I ain't scared of you.

27:15.421 --> 27:16.861
I know you know
that tricky shit.

27:16.901 --> 27:19.184
I'm not responsible
for your assumptions.

27:19.224 --> 27:21.826
You full of shit,
you understand that?

27:21.866 --> 27:25.229
Not being able to speak
is not the same as not speaking.

27:25.269 --> 27:27.231
You seem as if you like to talk.

27:27.311 --> 27:29.152
I let people talk
who like to talk.

27:29.192 --> 27:32.876
It makes it easier to find out
how full of shit they are.

27:33.916 --> 27:35.918
What the hell did you just say?

27:35.958 --> 27:37.840
I like people to talk...

27:39.281 --> 27:40.883
So I'm the one full of shit?

27:40.923 --> 27:42.404
We both full of shit.

27:42.444 --> 27:43.925
You full of shit.

27:46.287 --> 27:47.728
I'm gonna kick your ass.

27:48.769 --> 27:50.491
Don't nobody do that but me.

27:51.452 --> 27:53.613
You want me to kick your ass,
don't you?

27:58.818 --> 28:00.899
You must take me to see
Consul Han right away.

28:00.939 --> 28:04.423
Just sit there and shut up.
This ain't no democracy.

28:05.544 --> 28:08.346
-Yes, it is.
-No, it ain't.

28:08.386 --> 28:11.348
This is the United States
of James Carter now.

28:11.388 --> 28:14.511
I'm the president,
I'm the emperor, I'm the king.

28:14.551 --> 28:16.433
I'm Michael Jackson, you Tito.

28:16.473 --> 28:18.435
Your ass belong to me.

28:18.475 --> 28:20.877
Why would they not want my help?

28:20.917 --> 28:22.878
'Cause they don't give a damn
about you.

28:22.918 --> 28:25.160
They don't like you.
I don't like you.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.363
I don't care.
I'm here for the girl.

28:27.403 --> 28:29.965
The girl don't like you.
Nobody likes you.

28:30.005 --> 28:32.367
You came all the way
over here for nothing.

28:32.407 --> 28:34.288
You ain't gonna be--

28:34.328 --> 28:36.570
Beach Boys.

28:36.610 --> 28:38.372
Oh, hell, no.

28:38.411 --> 28:39.973
You didn't just touch
my goddamn radio.

28:40.013 --> 28:42.375
The Beach Boys
are great American music.

28:42.415 --> 28:44.897
The Beach Boys'll get you
a great ass-whoopin'.

28:44.937 --> 28:47.219
Don't you ever touch
a black man's radio, boy.

28:47.259 --> 28:48.901
You can do that in China...

28:48.941 --> 28:51.423
but you'll get your ass
killed out here.

28:51.423 --> 28:53.425
Let me show you real music.

28:54.946 --> 28:56.948
That's real music.
You hear that?

29:07.357 --> 29:11.360
Now can you do that
to the Beach Boys?

29:11.400 --> 29:12.881
Hell no!

29:26.413 --> 29:29.376
I must get to the consulate.
What are we doing here?

29:29.416 --> 29:32.378
It's called a shakedown.
Very serious police work.

29:32.418 --> 29:35.421
Just watch me handle my business
and patrol this place.

29:35.461 --> 29:37.262
I want to help
with the investigation.

29:37.302 --> 29:38.743
This is my case.

29:40.425 --> 29:43.707
Your case?
Look, you can back me up.

29:43.747 --> 29:48.232
When we get in here,
follow my lead and do what I do.

29:54.437 --> 29:55.878
What's up, my nigger?

29:55.918 --> 29:56.919
What's up?

29:59.281 --> 30:00.522
Is this weed?

30:00.562 --> 30:01.723
What?

30:05.287 --> 30:08.089
You got a prescription for this?
Where is it?

30:09.129 --> 30:10.571
Where is it?

30:10.611 --> 30:11.732
Where?

30:11.772 --> 30:13.093
Where?

30:15.335 --> 30:16.495
Where? Where?

30:16.535 --> 30:19.059
-I should take your ass to jail.
-For what?

30:19.098 --> 30:20.219
For what? Look at this!

30:20.259 --> 30:22.821
-That's nothing but a cigarette.
-This ciga-weed!

30:22.861 --> 30:24.103
Well, it look like cigarette.

30:24.143 --> 30:26.144
-You better have glaucoma.
-I do.

30:31.629 --> 30:32.950
What's up, my nigger?

30:35.952 --> 30:37.754
Hey, check that, baby.

30:44.480 --> 30:46.721
What's happening, Carter?

30:46.762 --> 30:50.045
Put the guns down!

30:50.085 --> 30:53.288
M.C. Hammer there,
put the goddamn gun down.

30:53.328 --> 30:55.449
Now, I got some questions,
and I need some answers.

30:55.489 --> 30:56.731
Put 'em down.

30:56.771 --> 30:59.293
Where the girl?
The little girl.

30:59.333 --> 31:01.334
-What little girl?
-The little Chinese girl.

31:01.374 --> 31:03.096
I don't know nothin'
about no Chinese girl.

31:03.136 --> 31:04.938
Don't act like you don't know.

31:04.978 --> 31:06.779
I'll take your asses in
if I don't get answers.

31:06.819 --> 31:08.340
Carter, put the gun down.

31:08.380 --> 31:11.543
Don't act like you know me.
You don't know me.

31:11.583 --> 31:12.905
I see what's going on here.

31:12.945 --> 31:14.906
Y'all trying to play me
like a fool.

31:14.946 --> 31:17.068
Lee, go outside real quick.

31:17.108 --> 31:18.910
It's gonna get
a little dangerous in here.

31:18.949 --> 31:20.070
I may have ques--

31:20.110 --> 31:21.912
Lee, go and wait by the bar.

31:21.952 --> 31:24.394
Remember what I told you?
Back me up.

31:24.434 --> 31:25.755
I'll take care of everything.

31:25.795 --> 31:26.917
You're sure?

31:26.957 --> 31:28.438
I'm sure. Go on now.

31:28.438 --> 31:30.239
Go on!

31:30.279 --> 31:31.761
Think I'm playing?

31:31.841 --> 31:33.442
Hurry up!

31:39.447 --> 31:40.609
Come here.

31:40.649 --> 31:43.411
Don't come in my business
scaring me like that.

31:43.450 --> 31:45.452
I was just playin'.
Man, give me a hug.

31:45.452 --> 31:47.614
Just schoolin' the rookie,
showing him the ropes.

31:47.654 --> 31:49.335
Why you didn't
come to church Sunday?

31:49.375 --> 31:51.937
I had some things
to take care of.

31:51.977 --> 31:53.900
But I made the night service.

31:53.940 --> 31:56.422
Yeah. Come here,
I wanna holler at you.

31:56.462 --> 31:57.622
What's up?

31:57.662 --> 32:01.226
Who's this guy buying up
these explosives and weapons?

32:01.266 --> 32:02.867
I don't know nothing
about that.

32:02.907 --> 32:05.629
Luke, I know what you do.

32:05.669 --> 32:07.872
The only reason
why I ain't busted your ass...

32:07.911 --> 32:10.314
'cause you my cousin,
and it'd kill Aunt Bootsy.

32:11.434 --> 32:13.396
Why you gonna put
Aunt Bootsy in this?

32:13.436 --> 32:14.717
Luke, I ain't playin'.

32:14.757 --> 32:18.481
I know she got a bad heart,
but I will bust your ass.

32:18.521 --> 32:20.082
Tell me something.

32:22.444 --> 32:26.408
The word down in Chinatown is
there's this new dude in town.

32:26.448 --> 32:30.531
Bad-ass dude outta Hong Kong
buying up every goddamn thing.

32:30.571 --> 32:31.492
What's his name?

32:31.532 --> 32:33.613
Don't know.
He ain't buying shit from me.

32:33.654 --> 32:35.735
-You don't know his name?
-No.

32:35.775 --> 32:37.257
Don't nobody know his name.

32:45.304 --> 32:47.105
What's up, my nigger?

32:48.627 --> 32:50.068
What did you just say?

32:51.468 --> 32:54.191
What's up, my nigger?

33:06.362 --> 33:07.923
Come here!
You better watch your mouth!

33:10.085 --> 33:11.206
What you say, boy?

33:11.246 --> 33:12.928
I don't want trouble.

34:01.970 --> 34:03.811
Please...

34:03.851 --> 34:05.572
I said I don't want trouble.

34:07.414 --> 34:09.054
That's bad for you.

34:13.379 --> 34:15.821
-Where the little girl at?
-What little girl?

34:15.860 --> 34:18.023
You know what girl
I'm talking about.

34:18.063 --> 34:21.065
Man, you better take
your goddamn hands off my suit.

34:21.065 --> 34:22.867
Your mama bought me this
for Christmas.

34:22.907 --> 34:24.748
This is my favorite suit.

34:25.469 --> 34:28.232
I'll see you Thanksgiving.
Appreciate it.

34:28.272 --> 34:30.393
Get your big
Happy-Meal ass over!

34:30.434 --> 34:31.875
Get over in the corner!

34:31.915 --> 34:33.396
I'm still the law around here!

34:33.436 --> 34:35.878
Next time I come here,
y'all better clean this up!

34:35.918 --> 34:37.400
And brush your teeth!

34:37.440 --> 34:38.440
Let's go.

34:42.925 --> 34:45.847
-What are we doing here?
-I'm getting something to eat.

34:45.887 --> 34:49.130
You want anything,
like a Cup O'Noodles?

34:49.170 --> 34:53.254
Carter, stop wasting my time.
I made a promise to Soo Yung.

34:53.293 --> 34:55.696
You're right.
I have been wasting your time.

34:55.735 --> 34:58.578
I'm sorry. Just let me
go get something to eat.

34:58.618 --> 35:00.900
When I come back out, I'll take
you wherever you want to go.

35:03.102 --> 35:04.223
Shake on it?

35:06.184 --> 35:07.865
Hey, what are you doing?

35:07.906 --> 35:10.708
You ain't the only one
with quick hands, are you?

35:10.748 --> 35:12.390
I'll be right back.

35:19.396 --> 35:22.438
Hey, man, I got you
a beef-and-bean burrito.

35:35.049 --> 35:36.771
We have a taxicab approaching.

35:36.811 --> 35:40.894
A man stepping out--Asian.
About 5'10".

35:40.934 --> 35:42.736
We've got someone
approaching the gate.

35:42.776 --> 35:44.097
Dropped off by a cab.

35:48.101 --> 35:49.582
Tell them to intercept.

35:49.622 --> 35:50.783
Intercept.

35:50.823 --> 35:52.464
We will intercept.

35:57.949 --> 35:59.390
Can I help you?

35:59.430 --> 36:02.192
-Yes. I must see the consul.
-About what?

36:02.232 --> 36:04.555
Please, it's very important.

36:04.595 --> 36:07.677
Why don't you tell us
why you need to see the consul?

36:07.717 --> 36:09.199
We'll tell you
whether it's important.

36:09.239 --> 36:11.320
Do you have identification?

36:12.402 --> 36:14.323
It's about his daughter
Soo Yung.

36:14.363 --> 36:15.804
Hands above your head!

36:15.844 --> 36:17.246
He asked about
the consul's daughter.

36:17.286 --> 36:18.406
He asked about the daughter.

36:18.446 --> 36:20.288
You don't understand.
I was invited.

36:25.413 --> 36:27.374
Don't move! Throw your gun away.

36:27.414 --> 36:30.697
-He's gonna kill them.
-Is everything all right?

36:30.737 --> 36:32.698
You'll be safer
on the second floor.

36:32.739 --> 36:34.780
I'm sorry.

36:34.820 --> 36:36.622
I'm sorry about this.

36:57.760 --> 36:59.401
He went over.

36:59.441 --> 37:00.603
Let's go!

37:01.963 --> 37:04.326
He's on the grounds! Come on!

37:34.511 --> 37:36.353
Stay away from the window,
please.

37:36.394 --> 37:37.554
Right here.

37:43.399 --> 37:44.721
Get down! Now!

37:59.413 --> 38:00.574
Don't move!

38:13.986 --> 38:16.828
I think there has been
a misunderstanding.

38:16.868 --> 38:18.830
It's all right. It's OK.

38:18.870 --> 38:21.552
It's him. The guy from China.

38:21.592 --> 38:23.314
What?

38:23.354 --> 38:25.195
Come in, please.

38:29.398 --> 38:34.083
Mr. Russ, I would like you
to meet Detective inspector Lee.

38:34.123 --> 38:36.005
Excuse me very much.

38:39.167 --> 38:40.368
Your gun.

38:45.053 --> 38:47.214
Where the hell is Carter?

38:54.420 --> 38:56.462
Then I gotta put up with this.

38:58.264 --> 39:00.385
Seen a little Asian dude
about this height...

39:00.425 --> 39:02.187
with a steering wheel
on his arm?

39:02.227 --> 39:04.109
Go screw yourself.

39:04.149 --> 39:06.030
What you say?

39:06.070 --> 39:07.471
I said go screw yourself.

39:07.511 --> 39:10.394
You take your sensitive ass
up there and let me in!

39:10.434 --> 39:12.316
Don't make me get up
out of this truck!

39:12.356 --> 39:13.637
Let this putz in.

39:13.677 --> 39:16.159
Man, when I get up in here,
I'm slapping somebody.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.320
What happened, Carter?

39:18.360 --> 39:20.443
I ain't supposed to be
jumping on buses!

39:20.483 --> 39:23.325
I do not do that!
I am not Carl Lewis!

39:23.365 --> 39:25.087
Who is this man?

39:25.888 --> 39:27.328
Sir, I can explain.

39:27.369 --> 39:29.851
Agent Carter has been helping
with my investigation.

39:29.891 --> 39:32.733
He's upset that we have not
done our job.

39:32.773 --> 39:35.776
Me and Lee are taking care
of the situation.

39:35.816 --> 39:38.018
We have everything
under control.

39:38.058 --> 39:39.779
We'll get your daughter back
safe and sound.

39:39.819 --> 39:42.541
He is very passionate
about finding your daughter.

39:42.581 --> 39:44.864
Well, I owe you my gratitude.

39:44.904 --> 39:48.346
We wanted Detective Lee to have
one of our best men by his side.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.349
Agent Russ,
maybe this is a good time...

39:50.389 --> 39:52.470
to tell him
the details of my assignment.

39:54.912 --> 39:56.874
Can I speak to you
for a moment?

39:56.914 --> 39:58.636
You wanna speak to me?
For a moment?

39:58.675 --> 39:59.876
In private?

40:01.397 --> 40:05.041
Oh, I see!
This must be G-14 classified.

40:05.081 --> 40:06.603
FBI-type stuff.

40:06.643 --> 40:10.365
Let me call my captain
and let him know what going on.

40:10.405 --> 40:14.730
We'll talk in a second.
When a G-14 comes around.

40:14.770 --> 40:15.930
Who's this? Hello?

40:15.970 --> 40:17.972
Am I speaking with FBI?

40:18.012 --> 40:20.894
-Give me the phone.
-Yeah, this is the FBI.

40:20.934 --> 40:22.656
You are FBI?

40:22.696 --> 40:24.377
Yeah, this is the FBI.

40:24.417 --> 40:27.901
If you want the girl back alive,
listen and do not talk.

40:27.941 --> 40:29.422
OK, I'm listening.
Let me get a pen.

40:30.423 --> 40:31.904
All right. Cool.

40:31.944 --> 40:35.227
The drop will be made tonight.
11:00 p.m.

40:35.267 --> 40:37.749
The amount will be $50 million.

40:37.789 --> 40:39.391
Fifty million dollars?

40:39.431 --> 40:42.153
Who you think you kidnapped,
Chelsea Clinton?

40:42.192 --> 40:43.394
Keep him talking.

40:43.434 --> 40:45.916
In used currency.
Nothing bigger than a 50.

40:45.956 --> 40:48.958
All right. Cool.
Fifty million. No problem.

40:48.999 --> 40:52.242
I want 20 million in 50s...

40:52.282 --> 40:53.762
Twenty million in 50s.

40:53.802 --> 40:55.964
Twenty million in 20s...

40:56.004 --> 40:57.446
Twenty million in 20s.

40:57.486 --> 40:59.567
And 10 million in 10s.

40:59.608 --> 41:01.409
Ten million in 10s.

41:01.449 --> 41:03.251
You want any fries with that?

41:03.291 --> 41:04.692
What is your name?

41:04.732 --> 41:07.454
You called us.
Why you want to know my name?

41:07.494 --> 41:10.457
I just want to be able to tell
the consul who is responsible...

41:10.497 --> 41:12.859
for his daughter's death
because he talk too much.

41:12.899 --> 41:14.860
All right, hold up. Calm down.

41:14.900 --> 41:17.343
I'm trying to hook you up.
I'm on your side.

41:17.383 --> 41:19.385
You will receive instructions
for the drop...

41:19.425 --> 41:22.387
half an hour
before it is to be made.

41:22.428 --> 41:25.510
If it is successful,
the girl will live.

41:25.550 --> 41:27.392
I'm gonna make sure
you get the money...

41:27.432 --> 41:29.393
and we can spend it
together when you do...

41:29.433 --> 41:31.595
'cause I don't even
really work for them.

41:32.916 --> 41:35.639
We got it.
620 South Broadway. Downtown.

41:46.929 --> 41:51.412
Team one, proceed down 6th
to 6th and Broadway.

41:51.452 --> 41:54.895
Team two, I want you around
the back on 4th and Main.

41:54.935 --> 41:56.416
Set up a perimeter.

41:56.456 --> 41:59.339
Take your team and cover
the building floor by floor...

41:59.379 --> 42:01.101
all the way to the top. Move.

42:09.427 --> 42:10.909
Two men around back.

42:10.909 --> 42:12.390
They must not go
into the building.

42:12.430 --> 42:15.072
Yeah, you right.
Let's go tell them. Come on.

42:15.112 --> 42:16.794
Take positions on the corner.

42:18.796 --> 42:21.438
Mr. Russ, you must pull
your men back.

42:21.478 --> 42:23.359
What the hell
are you doing here?

42:23.399 --> 42:25.322
Where's Carter?

42:28.124 --> 42:29.925
Please, listen to me.

42:29.925 --> 42:32.407
You may be very competent,
but the mere fact...

42:32.447 --> 42:35.490
that you know this girl
compromises your judgment.

42:40.654 --> 42:44.378
Sir, if you were asking
for $50 million dollars...

42:44.418 --> 42:46.099
would you be in a place
like that?

42:46.139 --> 42:48.301
Get this clown away from me.

42:48.341 --> 42:49.502
Take a hike!

42:59.150 --> 43:00.392
Hey, man.

43:00.432 --> 43:01.752
Why were you hiding?

43:01.792 --> 43:03.314
What you talking about?
I wasn't hiding.

43:03.394 --> 43:04.595
You were hiding.

43:04.635 --> 43:06.636
I bent down to tie my shoe.

43:06.676 --> 43:08.679
Sir, the area is secured.

43:09.399 --> 43:10.400
Room's empty.

43:10.400 --> 43:11.761
Damn it!

43:30.017 --> 43:31.458
Everybody pull back!

43:31.498 --> 43:32.659
Goddamn!

43:32.699 --> 43:34.781
Get some paramedics
down here now!

43:34.821 --> 43:36.662
Evacuate the building
right away!

43:36.702 --> 43:38.184
Get fire crews here!

43:38.224 --> 43:40.986
We got an explosion
at 6th and Broadway.

44:44.241 --> 44:46.362
That ain't far enough, man!

44:46.402 --> 44:49.405
I ain't Kareem Abdul-Jabbar!
Push it down some more!

45:52.219 --> 45:54.741
Carter, don't come any--Stop!

45:54.821 --> 45:56.663
What the hell you--

46:19.282 --> 46:21.524
I think I done broke my shit.

46:21.564 --> 46:23.646
Who was that you was chasing?

46:23.686 --> 46:27.730
His name is Sang from Hong Kong.
Because of you he got away.

46:27.770 --> 46:30.051
Why you ain't tell me
about the bridge?

46:30.051 --> 46:32.453
-I did.
-No, you didn't.

46:32.493 --> 46:33.654
I said stop.

46:33.694 --> 46:35.336
I don't understand
what you be saying.

46:35.376 --> 46:37.017
What?

46:37.057 --> 46:39.779
You see what I'm saying?

46:39.819 --> 46:41.301
What's this in your hand?

46:41.341 --> 46:43.223
He dropped it.

46:43.263 --> 46:44.423
Oh, shit.

46:44.503 --> 46:47.145
-Come on.
-Where are we going?

46:47.185 --> 46:48.547
I messed up my suit.

46:59.316 --> 47:01.037
Fifteen seconds.

47:07.323 --> 47:08.964
Make a decision.

47:16.131 --> 47:17.452
Oh, shit!

47:19.613 --> 47:21.295
Did I come at a bad time?

47:21.335 --> 47:24.738
I got bad news for you, Johnson.
We're all dead.

47:24.738 --> 47:26.620
I was distracted, sir.

47:26.660 --> 47:28.621
Distractions can occur
in the field.

47:28.661 --> 47:30.543
That's why
we call this practice.

47:30.583 --> 47:32.986
If you can't handle
the pressure, then quit.

47:33.026 --> 47:34.226
Yes, sir.

47:34.266 --> 47:37.069
Man, give her a break.
Don't worry about him.

47:37.109 --> 47:40.031
How you doing, girl?
Give me some love.

47:40.071 --> 47:41.712
Why are you tormenting me?

47:41.752 --> 47:43.234
That any way to treat
an old friend?

47:43.274 --> 47:46.397
I came to see how you was doing,
and I need some help.

47:46.437 --> 47:48.238
Help?

47:48.278 --> 47:50.480
I know that you have
strong feelings for me...

47:50.520 --> 47:52.321
but we gotta put that aside.

47:52.361 --> 47:54.003
It's a little girl's life
at stake here.

47:54.043 --> 47:56.485
Since when do care about anybody
but yourself?

47:56.525 --> 47:58.767
Please just take a look at this.

47:58.807 --> 48:01.650
We found this on a kidnapper.
Tell me what this is.

48:01.690 --> 48:04.973
You want me to work with you?
I don't have time for this.

48:05.013 --> 48:06.854
I got enough shit to deal with.

48:08.775 --> 48:10.177
Who are you?

48:10.217 --> 48:12.739
-Sorry we got you in trouble.
-Yeah, he's sorry.

48:12.819 --> 48:14.500
Tell me something
about this I don't know.

48:14.541 --> 48:17.383
A remote. Could be nitro cap,
could be cross-delayed...

48:17.423 --> 48:19.425
definitely not homemade,
definitely not American.

48:19.465 --> 48:22.788
It could open up a garage door,
or blow up some C-4.

48:22.828 --> 48:24.550
C-4?

48:24.590 --> 48:26.111
Yeah, C-4.

48:28.032 --> 48:30.514
This means so much to me.

48:32.036 --> 48:34.518
Hey, and I'm sorry about
spreading all those rumors...

48:34.558 --> 48:36.479
on Christmas about us
sleeping together.

48:36.519 --> 48:37.801
What?!

48:37.841 --> 48:39.282
He's just joking.

48:46.608 --> 48:48.690
Hey, Bobby, what's up, man?

48:50.171 --> 48:53.695
-I need to see Clive Cod.
-No way, Carter.

48:53.735 --> 48:55.696
It's lights out.
They're locked down.

48:55.736 --> 48:56.857
You want me to lose my job?

48:56.897 --> 49:00.540
I got you this damn job.
You better let me in here.

49:00.580 --> 49:01.942
Can't do it.

49:01.982 --> 49:04.624
Didn't I turn my back when
you bought that bag of weed?

49:04.664 --> 49:06.946
I was splitting it with you.

49:06.986 --> 49:08.427
Didn't I give you
the bigger half?

49:08.467 --> 49:10.429
Do me this favor.

49:12.030 --> 49:14.632
Shit. You got five minutes.

49:14.672 --> 49:16.474
Hey, Cod.

49:16.474 --> 49:18.316
Your two brothers
are here to see you.

49:24.121 --> 49:27.164
Clive, how you doing, man?

49:27.204 --> 49:29.245
You got a lot of balls,
coming here.

49:29.325 --> 49:32.288
I was just around the way.
Figured you would be bored.

49:32.328 --> 49:34.570
I came to see how you was doing.

49:34.610 --> 49:36.010
What the hell do you want?

49:36.050 --> 49:37.692
I just came to bring you a gift.

49:37.732 --> 49:40.895
I know you got time to kill.
I brought you a toy.

49:40.935 --> 49:42.777
-I don't want that.
-You don't?

49:42.817 --> 49:44.858
Somebody told me
you like this stuff.

49:44.898 --> 49:47.901
I don't like stuff like that.
I don't even know what it is.

49:47.941 --> 49:49.462
You never sold this to nobody?

49:49.502 --> 49:51.665
How could l,
when I don't know what it is?

49:51.705 --> 49:53.746
-Hold it.
-I don't want to hold it.

49:53.786 --> 49:56.669
-Just touch it.
-I don't want to touch it.

49:56.709 --> 49:58.910
-You scared of it?
-You think I'm stupid?

49:58.950 --> 50:00.071
Stupid enough to get busted.

50:00.111 --> 50:02.153
You want my fingerprints
so you can frame me.

50:02.193 --> 50:03.714
Why would I do something
like that?

50:03.754 --> 50:05.316
Think I would try
tricking you again?

50:05.356 --> 50:06.957
I don't have to frame you.

50:06.997 --> 50:09.479
You'll do life
for killing the little girl.

50:09.519 --> 50:11.120
I don't know anything
about a little girl.

50:11.160 --> 50:14.003
That ain't
what I'll tell everybody.

50:14.043 --> 50:15.725
I don't know anything.

50:15.765 --> 50:17.086
I got a big mouth, Clive.

50:17.126 --> 50:18.287
Let me tell you something.

50:18.327 --> 50:21.330
I don't know anything,
so you can kiss my fat ass.

50:21.370 --> 50:23.772
It'd take me all day
to kiss your fat ass.

50:23.772 --> 50:25.493
You want some of this?

50:25.533 --> 50:27.215
I'll give you all you want.

50:27.254 --> 50:28.816
Give me a name.

50:28.856 --> 50:30.617
I ain't telling you shit.

50:33.540 --> 50:35.142
She's only 11 years old.

50:35.182 --> 50:37.424
I don't want her to die.

50:37.464 --> 50:39.745
Look at the picture.

50:39.786 --> 50:41.867
I don't care about him or you.

50:41.907 --> 50:44.149
I care about the little girl.

50:44.189 --> 50:46.351
Give me the name.

50:55.919 --> 50:58.081
The guy's name is Juntao.

50:58.121 --> 50:59.803
I never seen him.

50:59.843 --> 51:01.164
Where can I find him?

51:01.204 --> 51:03.125
Foo Chow Restaurant.
Chinatown.

51:03.165 --> 51:04.407
Foo Chow Restaurant?

51:04.447 --> 51:07.129
Get rid of this guy.
He'll get you killed.

51:07.169 --> 51:09.811
Clive, thank you, man.
I'm gonna come back.

51:09.851 --> 51:12.173
I'm gonna bring your fat ass
some cookies.

51:30.829 --> 51:32.031
That's it right there.

51:36.955 --> 51:38.996
What are we waiting for?

51:39.036 --> 51:42.599
We scoping the place out, man.
Ain't gonna run up in there.

51:42.640 --> 51:44.801
That's how you get shot.

51:47.243 --> 51:48.565
I'm falling asleep.

52:02.536 --> 52:04.699
Hunh yeah.

52:04.739 --> 52:07.101
What is it good for?

52:07.141 --> 52:08.661
Absolutely nothing.

52:08.742 --> 52:10.183
Sing it again, you all.

52:10.223 --> 52:13.706
War, hunh, yeah.

52:13.746 --> 52:15.708
What is it good for?

52:15.748 --> 52:17.229
Absolutely nothing.

52:17.269 --> 52:18.870
Sing it again, you all.

52:18.910 --> 52:22.113
War, hunh, yeah.

52:22.153 --> 52:24.755
What is it good for?
Absolutely--

52:24.795 --> 52:26.997
You don't know nothing
about no war.

52:27.037 --> 52:28.599
Everybody knows war.

52:28.639 --> 52:30.640
Hunh, yeah.

52:30.680 --> 52:32.842
What is it good for?

52:32.882 --> 52:35.444
Absolutely nothing.

52:35.484 --> 52:37.687
Good God, you all.

52:37.727 --> 52:40.049
It ain't you all, it's y'all.

52:43.811 --> 52:46.053
Man, you sound
like a karate movie. Y'all!

52:47.175 --> 52:49.056
Say it from right here
with some soul. Y'all.

52:52.299 --> 52:54.781
Let me show your goofy ass
how to do this.

52:57.904 --> 52:59.705
What is it good for?

52:59.745 --> 53:01.347
Absolutely nothing.

53:01.387 --> 53:02.748
Come on.

53:02.788 --> 53:06.311
War, hunh, yeah.

53:06.351 --> 53:08.313
What is it good for?

53:08.353 --> 53:10.075
Absolutely nothing.

53:10.115 --> 53:11.555
Listen to me.

53:11.596 --> 53:13.517
War, hunh.

53:17.361 --> 53:19.082
Come on, come on.

53:24.606 --> 53:25.808
Do that again.

53:25.848 --> 53:28.210
Do it again. Like this?

54:17.252 --> 54:18.933
One will be inserted
into the suitcase.

54:18.973 --> 54:21.976
The other will be on you.
Now when you make the drop--

54:25.900 --> 54:27.220
Do we have it?

54:27.260 --> 54:28.742
All right, pick it up.

54:30.904 --> 54:32.385
You have what I asked for?

54:32.425 --> 54:33.546
I do.

54:33.586 --> 54:36.228
I hope now you realize
how serious I am.

54:36.268 --> 54:37.869
Take the money to the alley...

54:37.949 --> 54:40.431
behind the Foo Chow Restaurant
in Chinatown.

54:40.471 --> 54:43.314
You have 29 minutes left.

54:56.966 --> 55:00.129
Damn, Chen,
this is some greasy shit.

55:00.169 --> 55:01.530
You ain't got no better food...

55:01.570 --> 55:03.652
Like some chicken wings,
some baby back ribs...

55:03.692 --> 55:05.413
some fries or something?

55:05.453 --> 55:07.855
Chinese food, no soul food here.

55:07.895 --> 55:10.497
I didn't say soul food.
I said better food.

55:10.537 --> 55:11.699
I don't want that greasy shit.

55:11.739 --> 55:14.141
How you gonna sell
a big box of grease?

55:14.181 --> 55:15.342
I'm chilly a what?

55:15.382 --> 55:17.904
Come on.

55:17.984 --> 55:19.185
I'm no punk bitch.

55:19.225 --> 55:20.627
I ain't no punk bitch neither.

55:20.667 --> 55:22.788
-I'm no punk bitch.
-I'll knock your hat off.

55:22.828 --> 55:23.949
Come on.

55:23.989 --> 55:25.751
Man, what you got me eating?

55:25.791 --> 55:27.032
That's eel.

55:27.072 --> 55:28.313
Is it good?

55:28.353 --> 55:29.674
Very good.

55:29.714 --> 55:31.476
What you got?

55:31.516 --> 55:32.837
Camel's hump.

55:32.877 --> 55:34.158
What?

55:34.278 --> 55:36.200
Camel's hump.

55:42.846 --> 55:44.287
Kinda good.

55:44.327 --> 55:47.089
Need a little hot sauce,
but it's kinda good, though.

55:48.650 --> 55:50.973
-We still waiting?
-Yeah.

55:53.054 --> 55:54.896
How we gonna get Juntao?

55:54.936 --> 55:57.418
How we know he exists?
Ain't nobody seen him.

55:57.458 --> 55:59.860
I know. He killed my partner.

56:01.862 --> 56:03.824
I'm sorry about that, man.

56:03.864 --> 56:05.825
That's one reason
I don't have no partner.

56:05.865 --> 56:07.466
That's one thing
I learned from my daddy.

56:08.668 --> 56:09.949
Your daddy was a policeman?

56:09.989 --> 56:11.790
Fifteen years LAPD.

56:11.830 --> 56:14.032
My father was also a policeman.

56:14.072 --> 56:15.194
Your daddy was a cop?

56:15.274 --> 56:16.794
Not a cop, an officer.

56:16.835 --> 56:18.676
A legend all over Hong Kong.

56:18.716 --> 56:20.798
My daddy a legend, too.
All over America.

56:20.879 --> 56:24.040
My daddy once arrested 15 people
in one night by himself.

56:24.080 --> 56:26.003
My daddy arrest 25 by himself.

56:26.723 --> 56:28.565
My daddy
saved five crackheads...

56:28.605 --> 56:30.366
from a burning building
by himself.

56:30.406 --> 56:33.209
My daddy once caught a bullet
with his bare hands.

56:33.249 --> 56:35.210
My daddy'll kick
your daddy's ass...

56:35.250 --> 56:36.892
all the way from here
to China...

56:36.932 --> 56:38.333
or Japan or wherever you from.

56:38.373 --> 56:40.015
All up that Great Wall, too.

56:40.054 --> 56:42.457
-Don't talk about my father.
-Don't talk about my daddy.

56:44.098 --> 56:46.660
Hey, that your boy?

56:46.700 --> 56:48.182
Yes. Let's go.

56:50.704 --> 56:53.106
I better go in first.
Ain't nobody gonna recognize me.

56:53.146 --> 56:55.107
I'll wait five minutes.

56:56.189 --> 56:57.670
Hey, you take my ID.

56:57.710 --> 57:01.113
If anything go wrong,
you bust in like you're LAPD.

57:05.797 --> 57:08.158
This won't work. I'm not 6'1".

57:08.198 --> 57:10.400
Yes, it will work.
It's all about attitude.

57:10.440 --> 57:11.922
Flip it open, flip it closed.

57:11.962 --> 57:14.044
Do it fast. Open, close. Fast.

57:16.045 --> 57:17.527
You'll get it. Look.

57:17.567 --> 57:19.368
Take this.

57:23.492 --> 57:25.974
Hey, man, act like
you're from out of town.

57:26.014 --> 57:27.816
I am from out of town.

57:27.856 --> 57:30.137
Don't act like a cop.
Act like a tourist.

57:30.177 --> 57:32.539
Don't be so obvious. All right.

57:32.579 --> 57:34.301
OK, no problem.

57:35.342 --> 57:37.583
-Hi.
-How you doing?

57:37.624 --> 57:39.586
-For one?
-No, for two.

57:39.626 --> 57:41.587
I'm here for a meeting
with Mr. Juntao.

57:41.587 --> 57:44.670
I'm sorry,
I don't know Mr. Juntao.

57:44.710 --> 57:45.951
Maybe you don't understand.

57:45.991 --> 57:47.753
I'm Mr. Juntao's lawyer.
Legal advisor.

57:47.793 --> 57:51.916
He got into some shit again.
I'm a very busy man.

57:51.956 --> 57:53.398
I ain't got time
to be coming down here.

57:53.398 --> 57:55.960
My wife wants me to come home,
baby's shitting all over.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.441
Would you please get Mr. Juntao?

57:57.481 --> 57:59.963
But I have already told you
I don't know--

58:00.003 --> 58:01.764
You think I came here
for nothing?

58:01.804 --> 58:03.246
You gonna give me gas money?

58:03.286 --> 58:04.727
You got $5.00 on you?

58:04.767 --> 58:07.649
Would you please go tell
Mr. Juntao to get his ass here?

58:09.051 --> 58:11.293
Thank you.

58:11.333 --> 58:12.494
Can I sit right here?

58:12.534 --> 58:14.416
Right here? Thank you.

58:17.178 --> 58:19.139
-Hi.
-Y'all got any eel?

58:19.179 --> 58:20.381
Sure.

58:20.421 --> 58:23.304
How's your camel hump?

58:24.784 --> 58:26.145
Excuse me?

58:26.185 --> 58:29.028
Where is Roscoe's
Chicken and Waffles?

58:30.549 --> 58:33.152
This way?

58:33.192 --> 58:36.435
I'm sorry.
I'm from out of town.

58:36.475 --> 58:38.756
Thank you.

58:38.797 --> 58:40.718
Welcome.

58:40.758 --> 58:42.200
What's that?

59:23.075 --> 59:24.836
No, wait.

59:30.401 --> 59:33.083
Get the girl out of here.

59:33.123 --> 59:36.526
Make sure those two don't leave.

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:32.133
Juntao will see you.

01:00:32.173 --> 01:00:33.455
It's about time.

01:00:47.387 --> 01:00:48.668
Stop it!

01:00:48.708 --> 01:00:50.549
Let me go!

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.562
This is tight.
Ain't nothing like downstairs.

01:01:05.602 --> 01:01:07.123
Y'all got it going--

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:10.446
What's up, man?
What y'all watching?

01:01:16.211 --> 01:01:18.173
Where Juntao at?

01:01:21.696 --> 01:01:23.658
Why y'all so quiet?

01:01:28.982 --> 01:01:30.544
That was childish, man.

01:01:30.584 --> 01:01:32.265
That wasn't even called for!

01:01:32.305 --> 01:01:35.668
Now I came down here
to see Juntao...

01:01:35.708 --> 01:01:37.469
'cause he told me
to come down here...

01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:40.192
'cause I'm his half-brother
from Beijing.

01:01:40.232 --> 01:01:43.635
Me and him got the same mama.
I'm Blackinese.

01:01:43.675 --> 01:01:46.197
We all the same. Whoa.
Wait a minute.

01:01:46.237 --> 01:01:47.918
OK, you gonna kill me?

01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:49.881
OK, put the gun down,
fight me like a man.

01:01:50.961 --> 01:01:53.283
That's right,
fight me like a man. Shit!

01:01:53.323 --> 01:01:56.806
Anybody can shoot somebody.
That's what I'm talking about.

01:01:56.846 --> 01:01:58.848
Back. Give me some room.

01:01:58.888 --> 01:02:00.690
You don't know
who you messing with.

01:02:00.730 --> 01:02:01.890
I'm gonna knock that yellow--

01:02:05.974 --> 01:02:07.736
Which one of y'all kicked me?

01:02:07.776 --> 01:02:09.537
Me.

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:14.422
OK. All right.

01:02:25.551 --> 01:02:27.112
Hold on. Let's talk about this.

01:02:27.192 --> 01:02:29.835
Let's talk about this, man.

01:02:29.875 --> 01:02:31.916
No, no. What that mean?

01:02:31.956 --> 01:02:33.238
Hey, man,
this is a misunderstanding.

01:02:33.278 --> 01:02:34.839
Come on, let's pray about this.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.402
FBI, huh?

01:02:38.442 --> 01:02:39.923
No, I ain't FBI.

01:02:39.963 --> 01:02:42.245
I'm a security guard,
I work at the mall.

01:02:42.285 --> 01:02:43.807
Now wipe yourself off.

01:02:45.167 --> 01:02:47.130
You're bleeding.

01:02:55.137 --> 01:02:56.898
Oh, hell naw.

01:02:56.938 --> 01:02:59.140
He just playing, man.
He ain't mean that.

01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:00.981
He meant cut me loose.
Let me go.

01:03:01.021 --> 01:03:02.703
No, no!

01:03:02.743 --> 01:03:03.903
LAPD.

01:03:15.033 --> 01:03:16.435
What you doing?

01:03:59.311 --> 01:04:00.473
Watch out!

01:04:03.355 --> 01:04:04.876
Behind you.

01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:12.643
Freeze!

01:04:12.683 --> 01:04:14.724
We kicked y'all ass.

01:04:14.764 --> 01:04:16.286
All y'all.

01:04:16.326 --> 01:04:18.007
Y'all got your ass kicked.

01:04:23.812 --> 01:04:24.974
Oh, shit.

01:04:28.216 --> 01:04:29.537
Hey, man!

01:04:36.543 --> 01:04:37.905
I'm gonna kill your ass.

01:05:05.208 --> 01:05:06.969
Lee! Over here, man!

01:05:07.009 --> 01:05:08.531
Move! Move!

01:05:22.823 --> 01:05:24.304
Is that my gun?

01:05:26.146 --> 01:05:28.187
-It is my gun.
-Let's go.

01:05:32.271 --> 01:05:35.554
Why you gotta drop
the goddamn badge?

01:05:35.594 --> 01:05:37.716
Then you threw the gun
out the window.

01:05:39.237 --> 01:05:41.079
Come on, this way.

01:05:48.966 --> 01:05:52.209
I got everything under control.
Don't worry about nothing.

01:05:52.249 --> 01:05:54.691
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!

01:05:54.731 --> 01:05:55.891
It's cool.

01:05:55.931 --> 01:05:58.133
Why am I not surprised
to find you here, Carter?

01:05:58.173 --> 01:06:02.297
Dan, I want these two back
at the consulate immediately.

01:06:04.218 --> 01:06:05.981
Let's take a ride, gentlemen.

01:06:21.353 --> 01:06:24.957
You better get your hand off me.
Hey, man, he with me.

01:06:30.921 --> 01:06:33.764
Just let me explain.
I'll start from the top.

01:06:33.804 --> 01:06:36.286
We were making the drop.
Han was about to get her back...

01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:38.168
and you two screwed it up.

01:06:38.208 --> 01:06:40.770
What you talking about?
Didn't you hear what Lee said?

01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:43.653
Mr. Lee is on his way
to Hong Kong.

01:06:43.693 --> 01:06:45.654
Now get out of here
before I file...

01:06:45.734 --> 01:06:47.896
obstruction of justice charges
against you.

01:06:47.936 --> 01:06:50.178
We was about to solve the case.
All we need to do--

01:06:50.218 --> 01:06:52.900
You're no longer
on this assignment, Carter.

01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:54.462
Case closed.

01:07:11.556 --> 01:07:14.198
-Consul Han!
-Sorry, sir.

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:18.522
It was all my fault.

01:07:18.562 --> 01:07:20.884
Lee would never do anything to
jeopardize your daughter's life.

01:07:20.924 --> 01:07:22.525
He loves your daughter.

01:07:22.565 --> 01:07:25.768
It's a little too late
for apologies.

01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:30.492
Consul...you have a call.

01:07:30.532 --> 01:07:32.134
We're ready.

01:07:32.174 --> 01:07:34.616
OK, pick it up.

01:07:37.819 --> 01:07:41.942
The ransom is now 70 million.
I will call with instructions.

01:07:41.982 --> 01:07:44.945
You deliver the money or pick up
the body of your daughter.

01:07:44.985 --> 01:07:48.388
Please. You must understand.
What happened tonight was not--

01:07:53.192 --> 01:07:58.156
Soo Yung, please tell them
I will do whatever--

01:08:21.457 --> 01:08:24.219
Sorry, man.

01:08:24.259 --> 01:08:26.260
Be sorry for Soo Yung.

01:08:51.282 --> 01:08:53.484
No hard leads.

01:08:53.524 --> 01:08:54.685
None.

01:08:56.727 --> 01:09:00.448
Listen, we're doing
all we can here, all right?

01:09:00.488 --> 01:09:03.051
Tracing everything that's coming
into this compound.

01:09:03.091 --> 01:09:05.374
Excuse me, Consul.
You have a guest.

01:09:05.413 --> 01:09:07.576
Jack, let me get back to you.

01:09:10.459 --> 01:09:11.618
Thomas.

01:09:15.863 --> 01:09:17.424
I'm sorry, my friend.

01:09:17.464 --> 01:09:19.786
I couldn't stand by
and do nothing.

01:09:34.158 --> 01:09:35.800
Hey! What's up, baby?

01:09:36.961 --> 01:09:39.844
Man, you got guts calling me.
I'm gonna hang up.

01:09:39.884 --> 01:09:41.725
Hey, wait a minute.

01:09:41.765 --> 01:09:43.567
Don't hang up.
Look, you know what?

01:09:43.607 --> 01:09:46.448
You was right about me,
all right? I'm sorry.

01:09:46.488 --> 01:09:48.571
-Are you on drugs?
-You was right.

01:09:48.611 --> 01:09:50.973
I was egotistic.
I was inconsiderate.

01:09:51.013 --> 01:09:53.575
-I was self-centered.
-Yeah.

01:09:53.615 --> 01:09:55.577
I ain't used to working
with partners...

01:09:55.617 --> 01:09:57.739
but it ain't about me.
It's the little girl.

01:09:57.779 --> 01:09:59.300
She gonna die without our help.

01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:01.582
You understand what I'm saying?

01:10:01.622 --> 01:10:03.343
Not yet, but keep talking.

01:10:03.383 --> 01:10:06.787
I think something big going down
tonight, all right?

01:10:06.827 --> 01:10:08.988
I need to know
where the consul's gonna be.

01:10:09.028 --> 01:10:11.190
You think you can help me?

01:10:11.230 --> 01:10:13.192
I'll see what I can do.

01:10:13.233 --> 01:10:15.955
No. I don't need you to see.
I need you to do it.

01:10:16.035 --> 01:10:17.796
Can you do it?

01:10:19.237 --> 01:10:20.358
OK, Carter.

01:10:20.398 --> 01:10:23.041
-All right, one other thing.
-Yeah?

01:10:23.081 --> 01:10:25.082
What color panties you got on?

01:10:33.329 --> 01:10:35.091
Consul Han, I want you to go...

01:10:35.131 --> 01:10:37.093
to the Chinese expo
as you planned.

01:10:37.133 --> 01:10:39.455
Have the money
in the upstairs control room.

01:10:39.495 --> 01:10:41.456
Be sure to make no more mistake.

01:10:41.496 --> 01:10:43.818
I understand, but I want
to speak with my daughter!

01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:07.319
Excuse me, miss.
Who's the captain on this plane?

01:11:07.359 --> 01:11:10.121
Look, it don't even matter.
You need to go up there...

01:11:10.161 --> 01:11:12.884
tell the captain we got
a problem on the left side.

01:11:12.924 --> 01:11:15.366
Something wrong with the engine.
You need a new alternator.

01:11:15.406 --> 01:11:17.327
My supervisor said,
"Willy, go on down there...

01:11:17.367 --> 01:11:19.048
"and fix that plane.
Put the alternator on.

01:11:19.088 --> 01:11:20.850
"Don't let it leave
till I come down there."

01:11:20.890 --> 01:11:22.812
I suggest you tell
the proper authorities...

01:11:22.852 --> 01:11:25.534
not to move this plane
before the FAA comes here...

01:11:25.574 --> 01:11:27.616
and we all in some shit. Go on!

01:11:34.782 --> 01:11:36.664
What are you doing here?

01:11:36.704 --> 01:11:39.106
Now get your ass up.
We got work to do.

01:11:39.146 --> 01:11:41.267
Go away. I've disgraced myself.

01:11:41.307 --> 01:11:43.030
Lee, what about the little girl?

01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:46.112
Leave me alone. A man like you
could never understand.

01:11:46.151 --> 01:11:49.074
-A man like me?
-Devoted only to yourself.

01:11:49.114 --> 01:11:51.076
You're ashamed of being
a police officer.

01:11:51.157 --> 01:11:52.677
You dishonor your father's name.

01:11:52.717 --> 01:11:54.519
You don't know nothing
about my father.

01:11:54.559 --> 01:11:56.201
You say your father is a legend.

01:11:56.241 --> 01:11:58.162
My father was a legend.

01:11:58.202 --> 01:12:00.444
He was killed making a routine
traffic stop in daylight...

01:12:00.484 --> 01:12:02.366
by some punk
who didn't want no ticket...

01:12:02.406 --> 01:12:04.688
when his partner supposed
to get out of the car...

01:12:04.728 --> 01:12:06.129
and back him up, he didn't.

01:12:06.169 --> 01:12:09.892
My father was as devoted as you,
and now he's dead.

01:12:09.933 --> 01:12:12.895
And for what?
A traffic ticket and some punk?

01:12:12.935 --> 01:12:15.497
You tell me,
what's the honor in that?

01:12:15.537 --> 01:12:17.499
You believe your father
wasted his life...

01:12:17.539 --> 01:12:18.900
died for nothing?

01:12:20.822 --> 01:12:22.303
Prove me wrong.

01:12:25.265 --> 01:12:28.709
For 15 years until China
resumed control of Hong Kong...

01:12:28.789 --> 01:12:32.631
Juntao was the most powerful
crime lord in Southeast Asia.

01:12:32.671 --> 01:12:36.956
The British tried to close down
his operation, but we failed.

01:12:36.996 --> 01:12:39.117
But why the consul's daughter?

01:12:39.157 --> 01:12:41.800
Detective inspector Lee
helped me raid...

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:44.682
every known asset
of Juntao's operation.

01:12:44.722 --> 01:12:47.805
We confiscated millions
in weapons and cash...

01:12:47.845 --> 01:12:52.208
and a collection of Chinese art
unsurpassed in the world.

01:12:52.248 --> 01:12:56.012
Then Juntao disappeared.
No witnesses.

01:12:56.012 --> 01:12:59.015
Do you really think
he'll kill the girl?

01:13:02.298 --> 01:13:06.861
My advice to you is...
pay the money.

01:13:22.194 --> 01:13:25.157
Consul, I'm going upstairs
to make the drop.

01:13:25.197 --> 01:13:28.440
I want you to remain calm
as if nothing's wrong...

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:31.563
and don't leave Agent Whitney's
side even for a moment.

01:13:31.603 --> 01:13:33.244
I understand.

01:14:27.090 --> 01:14:29.412
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:14:29.451 --> 01:14:31.414
I'm am Consul Han.

01:14:31.454 --> 01:14:34.096
On behalf of the People's
Republic of China...

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:35.457
thank you for coming.

01:14:40.301 --> 01:14:41.943
I am pleased to present...

01:14:41.983 --> 01:14:44.545
5,000 years of Chinese history
and heritage...

01:14:44.585 --> 01:14:47.027
a collection which,
until recently...

01:14:47.067 --> 01:14:49.028
was thought to be lost forever.

01:14:49.069 --> 01:14:51.751
This some nice shit.

01:14:51.791 --> 01:14:53.793
That Buddha'd go good
in my bathroom.

01:14:53.833 --> 01:14:57.436
Hey. This is the history
of my country....

01:14:57.476 --> 01:15:00.519
priceless pieces
of Chinese culture.

01:15:00.559 --> 01:15:02.640
If anything gets damaged...

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:05.362
Ain't nothing gonna happen
to none of this stuff.

01:15:05.403 --> 01:15:10.567
And now we can pass them on
to our children.

01:15:19.214 --> 01:15:21.376
Pardon me.

01:15:27.261 --> 01:15:29.383
I seen that guy
at that Chinese restaurant.

01:15:29.423 --> 01:15:32.706
Consul Han has been fighting flu
for the past few days...

01:15:32.746 --> 01:15:35.108
so perhaps I should finish
what he started.

01:15:35.148 --> 01:15:38.391
The first thing we gotta do
is clear out this riffraff.

01:15:38.431 --> 01:15:40.713
If anybody stay behind,
they got something to lose.

01:15:40.753 --> 01:15:42.435
Wait right here.
I'll be right back.

01:15:42.475 --> 01:15:45.717
...future between
our two countries.

01:15:45.757 --> 01:15:47.359
The more we see
the differences...

01:15:47.399 --> 01:15:48.519
Hey!

01:15:48.559 --> 01:15:49.681
And similarities--

01:15:49.721 --> 01:15:51.322
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen!

01:15:51.362 --> 01:15:52.483
Goddamn it.

01:15:52.523 --> 01:15:54.164
I'm Detective Carter
from the LAPD!

01:15:54.204 --> 01:15:56.606
Russ, we got Carter down here.

01:15:56.646 --> 01:15:58.449
What the hell's going on
down there?

01:15:58.489 --> 01:16:00.850
We have just received
a threat on the building.

01:16:00.891 --> 01:16:02.932
We ask that you please exit
the building...

01:16:02.972 --> 01:16:06.656
as soon as possible,
and please do not panic.

01:16:06.696 --> 01:16:09.899
Didn't you hear what I said?
Get your shit and go out!

01:16:09.939 --> 01:16:11.700
Get the hell out!
There's a bomb in the building!

01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:14.823
I don't believe this.
Agents, hold your positions!

01:16:14.863 --> 01:16:16.704
Everybody take care,
but hold your positions.

01:16:16.744 --> 01:16:17.865
What's going on?

01:16:17.905 --> 01:16:19.426
Get your old ass
out the building!

01:16:19.506 --> 01:16:21.268
Lady, put the glass down
and get out of here!

01:16:21.308 --> 01:16:25.712
Woman, the exit over there.
Gonna get your head blowed off!

01:16:25.752 --> 01:16:27.393
Come on, come on!

01:16:27.433 --> 01:16:29.835
Titty, titty, titty.
Get them titties outta here.

01:16:29.875 --> 01:16:31.077
Will somebody grab Carter?

01:16:45.929 --> 01:16:49.412
Consul Han, six blocks of C-4
are wired to your daughter...

01:16:49.452 --> 01:16:50.933
in a car outside.

01:16:55.698 --> 01:16:58.620
Before the changeover,
most of this exhibition...

01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:01.783
was in the hands
of a single private collector...

01:17:03.064 --> 01:17:04.345
Me.

01:17:04.385 --> 01:17:08.268
I worked most of my life
to acquire and catalog...

01:17:08.308 --> 01:17:11.071
these priceless pieces
that you see before you.

01:17:12.712 --> 01:17:15.275
And then, in one fell swoop...

01:17:15.315 --> 01:17:17.316
it was taken away from me.

01:17:18.557 --> 01:17:22.080
But tonight,
I shall be paid in full.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:25.163
Don't move!

01:17:25.203 --> 01:17:27.645
She dies if I press this button.

01:17:29.726 --> 01:17:31.928
Just be patient.

01:17:31.968 --> 01:17:34.610
My transportation
will be here shortly.

01:17:38.534 --> 01:17:39.856
Stay calm.

01:17:51.185 --> 01:17:54.468
I was just gonna tell you
you was in a red zone.

01:17:54.508 --> 01:17:55.669
There's cops all over--

01:17:58.991 --> 01:18:01.554
You didn't know I could do that.
Put your hands up!

01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:03.356
I ain't gonna kill you
this time.

01:18:03.396 --> 01:18:05.117
I'm just gonna kick your ass!

01:18:09.001 --> 01:18:12.003
You tell your friends about me.

01:18:23.733 --> 01:18:26.215
Hey, how you doing?

01:18:26.295 --> 01:18:27.736
We've been looking for you.

01:18:27.777 --> 01:18:29.538
I'm Detective Carter
from the LAPD.

01:18:29.578 --> 01:18:32.741
Everything is OK now.
I'll take you to your daddy.

01:18:32.781 --> 01:18:35.062
And first thing I'm gonna do
is take this vest off you.

01:18:35.103 --> 01:18:36.264
Don't touch it!

01:18:36.304 --> 01:18:38.065
I think it'll be safer
if we take it off.

01:18:38.105 --> 01:18:41.508
No. I heard them say
it will explode.

01:18:41.508 --> 01:18:44.471
I think it'll be safer
if we leave it on, OK?

01:18:44.511 --> 01:18:46.032
Don't--don't move.

01:18:46.072 --> 01:18:47.313
Where are you?

01:18:52.798 --> 01:18:53.919
Don't move!

01:18:53.959 --> 01:18:55.480
Hold your positions, goddamn it!

01:18:55.521 --> 01:18:57.682
Do not draw your weapons.

01:19:01.805 --> 01:19:03.688
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:19:03.728 --> 01:19:06.250
I think we'll call that
an evening.

01:19:06.290 --> 01:19:08.812
Thank you and good night.

01:19:34.994 --> 01:19:36.636
I got something for you!

01:19:37.997 --> 01:19:39.878
Got something you want.

01:19:44.322 --> 01:19:46.925
I got your bomb right here.

01:19:52.249 --> 01:19:54.891
Want to blow something up?

01:19:54.931 --> 01:19:56.212
Come on.

01:19:57.413 --> 01:19:59.615
Push the button. Come on.

01:20:01.456 --> 01:20:02.578
Push the button.

01:20:02.618 --> 01:20:05.540
-What are you doing?
-Play along.

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:07.221
Come on, push the button.

01:20:07.261 --> 01:20:08.984
Yeah, come on, push the button.

01:20:11.065 --> 01:20:12.186
Blow everybody up.

01:20:12.227 --> 01:20:14.028
Yeah, blow everybody up!

01:20:14.068 --> 01:20:15.989
Push the goddamn button!

01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:19.432
You heard what she said.

01:20:20.913 --> 01:20:24.837
You got everybody excited about
something being blowed up...

01:20:24.837 --> 01:20:26.318
and look at your
little punk British ass.

01:20:26.358 --> 01:20:28.240
Come on! Push the button!

01:20:30.202 --> 01:20:31.322
Deal with it, please.

01:20:31.362 --> 01:20:32.844
Where you going?

01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:41.331
Cover the consul!

01:20:43.773 --> 01:20:45.975
It's OK. She's a professional.

01:20:46.015 --> 01:20:47.816
You must take the vest off.

01:20:47.856 --> 01:20:51.179
Just give me a second.

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:55.183
There's a trigger on this vest.

01:20:55.223 --> 01:20:57.545
It'll blow if I take it off.

01:21:03.711 --> 01:21:05.272
Haven't you done this before?

01:21:05.312 --> 01:21:07.834
It's a little different
in the practice room.

01:21:07.874 --> 01:21:09.115
Everybody take cover.

01:21:09.155 --> 01:21:11.838
We need more men down here.

01:21:11.878 --> 01:21:14.560
Say again. Dan, do you read--

01:21:27.531 --> 01:21:29.532
Need some help down here,
damn it!

01:21:35.818 --> 01:21:38.701
Roses are red...

01:21:38.741 --> 01:21:41.263
violets are blue.

01:21:42.503 --> 01:21:44.506
Sugar is sweet...

01:21:46.827 --> 01:21:48.428
and so are you.

01:21:56.635 --> 01:22:00.119
The remote can still set it off.

01:22:00.199 --> 01:22:02.080
Get rid of it.

01:22:07.445 --> 01:22:09.526
-She OK?
-Yes.

01:22:11.369 --> 01:22:13.730
I know that ain't the bomb!

01:22:14.771 --> 01:22:16.533
Get that bomb away from me!

01:22:16.573 --> 01:22:19.736
Take the bomb outside!

01:22:21.817 --> 01:22:24.179
Yeah, take it over to Juntao.

01:22:24.219 --> 01:22:26.421
You go that way,
I go that way. Go!

01:22:33.428 --> 01:22:34.868
Don't shoot!

01:23:42.927 --> 01:23:44.128
Shit!

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:02.624
Where are you going?

01:24:23.441 --> 01:24:25.284
Meet me on the roof.

01:24:25.324 --> 01:24:27.926
Roger.

01:24:49.544 --> 01:24:51.065
Don't move, man!

01:24:51.105 --> 01:24:56.029
Yeah, I been looking for your
sweet-and-sour chicken ass.

01:24:56.069 --> 01:24:59.392
Your boys ain't here now.
You all alone.

01:24:59.432 --> 01:25:01.514
I kill him.

01:25:01.554 --> 01:25:04.116
Go ahead. I don't even like him.

01:25:08.521 --> 01:25:10.602
Put your gun down.

01:25:10.642 --> 01:25:13.124
Fight like a man.

01:25:13.164 --> 01:25:14.565
What you say?

01:25:14.605 --> 01:25:16.087
Fight like a man.

01:25:17.247 --> 01:25:18.649
Fight like a man?

01:25:20.450 --> 01:25:22.612
All right,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

01:25:22.652 --> 01:25:25.055
Then I'm gonna
take your ass to jail.

01:25:25.055 --> 01:25:29.218
All right, come on,
put the gun down...

01:25:29.258 --> 01:25:30.620
same time.

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:57.683
Wipe yourself off, man.
You're dead.

01:27:09.183 --> 01:27:10.505
Thank you, God.

01:27:36.447 --> 01:27:37.608
Oh, shit.

01:27:59.828 --> 01:28:01.429
You know he dead.

01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:06.032
Help! Do something!

01:28:06.072 --> 01:28:08.754
Hey, be cool, man!

01:28:08.795 --> 01:28:10.276
Hang on!

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:16.841
I can't hold on anymore!

01:28:16.881 --> 01:28:19.844
Hang on for about an hour.
I'm gonna get the ambulance.

01:28:19.884 --> 01:28:22.647
-What are you doing?
-I'll be right back.

01:28:22.687 --> 01:28:25.089
-Carter!
-I was just playing.

01:28:29.933 --> 01:28:31.454
Do something!

01:28:35.178 --> 01:28:36.899
I can't hold on anymore!

01:28:55.835 --> 01:28:57.077
Oh, shit!

01:29:00.799 --> 01:29:02.762
Thank you! Thank you!

01:29:04.242 --> 01:29:07.766
-What the hell you doing?
-I was just being polite.

01:29:07.806 --> 01:29:10.448
Well, next time,
be polite to my nuts.

01:29:10.488 --> 01:29:12.450
I'm sorry.

01:29:12.490 --> 01:29:14.451
Thank you.

01:29:14.491 --> 01:29:16.133
Shit!

01:29:27.983 --> 01:29:29.464
Are you all right?

01:29:29.504 --> 01:29:30.865
I'm fine.

01:29:31.946 --> 01:29:35.789
-I owe you everything.
-Only your friendship.

01:29:39.673 --> 01:29:42.595
Look who's here.

01:29:42.595 --> 01:29:44.597
What took you so long?

01:29:49.521 --> 01:29:52.003
I think this belongs to you.

01:30:03.453 --> 01:30:05.215
I think you should come with me.

01:30:05.255 --> 01:30:07.377
Get on the plane
when you get off work.

01:30:07.457 --> 01:30:09.418
You fly for free.

01:30:09.458 --> 01:30:10.979
I'm just trying
to expand my horizons.

01:30:11.059 --> 01:30:14.182
Travel a little bit.
See the world.

01:30:18.547 --> 01:30:22.429
I'm through with y'all, man.
I'm going on vacation.

01:30:22.469 --> 01:30:25.512
Now, hold on there.
We were just coming by...

01:30:25.552 --> 01:30:27.514
to tell you what a great job
you did yesterday.

01:30:27.554 --> 01:30:29.556
And when you come back...

01:30:29.596 --> 01:30:31.918
there's gonna be
an FBI badge waiting for you.

01:30:33.199 --> 01:30:34.640
You serious?

01:30:36.081 --> 01:30:38.323
-Come on, don't be playing.
-No.

01:30:38.363 --> 01:30:41.406
I don't know what to say.
It's like a dream come true.

01:30:42.607 --> 01:30:45.610
I got an idea, though.

01:30:45.650 --> 01:30:49.853
Why don't y'all
take that badge...

01:30:49.893 --> 01:30:51.814
and shove it up your ass?

01:30:51.854 --> 01:30:55.298
All up in your ass. I'm LAPD.

01:30:58.701 --> 01:31:00.021
Bitch.

01:31:02.504 --> 01:31:05.506
First class. I like this.
This is tight.

01:31:05.506 --> 01:31:06.908
Can I take your jacket, sir?

01:31:06.948 --> 01:31:09.910
My jacket? No.
You can take this bag, though.

01:31:09.951 --> 01:31:11.912
How you doing? What's up?

01:31:11.952 --> 01:31:13.434
What's up, man?

01:31:13.474 --> 01:31:14.955
-You ready to go?
-Yep.

01:31:14.955 --> 01:31:16.476
May I offer you some peanuts?

01:31:22.241 --> 01:31:24.522
You never told me
you spoke Chinese.

01:31:24.562 --> 01:31:28.046
I never told you I didn't.
You assumed I didn't.

01:31:28.086 --> 01:31:31.088
This is cool. Han's letting me
go to Hong Kong with you.

01:31:31.169 --> 01:31:33.370
I ain't been on no vacation
in five years?

01:31:33.410 --> 01:31:36.493
We can hang in my crib.
I will show you my hood.

01:31:36.573 --> 01:31:38.895
No, you can show me a couple
of them Chinese girls.

01:31:38.935 --> 01:31:41.377
I want a massage.
I'm gonna get buck wild.

01:31:41.417 --> 01:31:45.862
No police work for two weeks?
How long this flight?

01:31:45.902 --> 01:31:48.544
-Fifteen hours.
-Fifteen hours?

01:31:48.584 --> 01:31:50.946
What are we gonna do
for 15 hours?

01:31:57.431 --> 01:31:58.552
War...

01:31:58.592 --> 01:32:01.835
Oh, hell, no! Stewardess!

01:32:01.875 --> 01:32:02.795
What is it good for?

01:32:02.795 --> 01:32:03.997
Stewardess, get me another seat!

01:32:04.037 --> 01:32:06.599
Nothing...Listen to me, y'all!

01:32:06.639 --> 01:32:07.840
Stewardess!

01:32:13.205 --> 01:32:14.406
Action!

01:32:17.048 --> 01:32:18.409
It broke.

01:32:25.896 --> 01:32:28.057
Don't move! Don't smile!

01:32:41.909 --> 01:32:44.792
What is this shit
about your daughter?

01:32:44.832 --> 01:32:45.953
Fifty million dollars?

01:32:45.993 --> 01:32:47.834
Who you think you got,
Kelsey Clinton?

01:32:47.875 --> 01:32:49.035
Fifty million dollars?

01:32:49.075 --> 01:32:51.597
Who you think you got,
Kelsey--What's the line?

01:32:51.677 --> 01:32:52.799
Fifty million dollars?

01:32:52.839 --> 01:32:55.040
Who you think you got--
Is it Chelsea or Kelsey?

01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:56.202
Fifty million dollars?

01:32:56.242 --> 01:32:57.683
Who you think you got,
Chelsea Carter?

01:32:57.683 --> 01:32:58.964
Fifty million dollars?

01:32:59.004 --> 01:33:01.967
Who you think you got,
Chelsea Grammer--Chelsea--

01:33:02.007 --> 01:33:03.888
Who do you think you got,
Chelsea Clinton?

01:33:03.928 --> 01:33:05.050
Fifty million dollars?

01:33:05.089 --> 01:33:07.171
Who you think you got,
Chelsea Clinton?

01:33:07.211 --> 01:33:08.492
Keep him talking--

01:33:08.532 --> 01:33:10.494
Cut! Go back to the beginning.

01:33:10.533 --> 01:33:12.736
Was that it, Chelsea--
Did I get it?

01:33:16.619 --> 01:33:17.780
Action!

01:33:39.759 --> 01:33:42.722
All right, let me
see your badge, buddy!

01:33:42.762 --> 01:33:45.244
No joke! Show your ass!

01:33:45.284 --> 01:33:48.886
Show your ass? Y'all scared--

01:33:48.926 --> 01:33:50.088
Cut!

01:33:51.009 --> 01:33:54.051
You know that other stuff,
but don't know his name?

01:33:54.091 --> 01:33:57.093
Man, people tell me shit.

01:33:59.096 --> 01:34:00.497
What's wrong with you?

01:34:03.059 --> 01:34:05.501
My daddy once caught--
catch a bullet--

01:34:05.541 --> 01:34:07.383
caught a bullet--
catch a bullet--

01:34:07.423 --> 01:34:08.543
caught a bullet.

01:34:08.583 --> 01:34:12.147
My daddy one caught a bullet
by his bare hand.

01:34:12.187 --> 01:34:13.868
No bullshit.

01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:17.231
What's the honor in that?

01:34:17.271 --> 01:34:20.274
You believe your father
wasting his life...

01:34:23.437 --> 01:34:25.398
They must not--

01:34:25.438 --> 01:34:27.440
You're right, man.
Let's go tell them.

01:34:28.961 --> 01:34:30.242
Anything goes wrong...
