I'm starting

A yearly beauty pageant,

- To impress colleges?

- And this is a horrible idea.

03:54.108 --> 03:55.777
- Yeah, beauty pageants
are sexist.

03:55.860 --> 03:56.653
- Exactly.
- Duh.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.529
- So what's wrong with sexy?

03:58.613 --> 03:59.989
- Ist!
Sexist.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.033

It's not cool to have a contest
where girls are supposed

04:09.290 --> 04:13.252
to "out-pretty" each other.
- Thank you.

04:13.336 --> 04:16.047
- Did you really think girls
at PCA would sign up for this?

04:16.130 --> 04:18.925

04:19.007 --> 04:22.011
seventeen girls have.
- What?

04:22.095 --> 04:24.180
- Why would all
these girls sign up?

04:24.263 --> 04:25.348
- I guess they're
interested in winning

04:25.431 --> 04:28.518
the insane first prize.
- Which is...?

04:28.601 --> 04:31.062
- Whoever wins gets to be
on the cover of Buzz magazine.

04:31.145 --> 04:33.106
- Buzz?!
- No way!

- The rotten little skunkbag

It's gonna be two minutes,
and it's gonna be amazing.

for the evening gown
competition.

Zo's got great taste. Why?

06:58.543 --> 07:01.754

- So?

07:01.838 --> 07:05.174
- So she's gonna make sure
her dress is better than yours.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.051
Coming up next on "duhhh."

07:07.135 --> 07:08.427
- Zoey's my friend.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.138
She wouldn't do
anything catty like that.

07:10.221 --> 07:13.683
- Sure, she wouldn't.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.068
- Hey. How come
you haven't signed up

07:24.152 --> 07:26.154

07:26.237 --> 07:28.239
- Ugh. Please.

07:28.322 --> 07:31.200
- What? You could win.
You have beauty.

but serious scientists

STUDENTS: Aww!

21:09.768 --> 21:11.019
- Hey, hey, hey!

21:11.103 --> 21:12.646
You two are outta the pageant!

21:12.729 --> 21:15.732
Out! So both of you just--

21:15.816 --> 21:17.859
[laughter]

21:21.488 --> 21:23.448
You are kidding me!

21:25.117 --> 21:28.745
You are kidding me!

21:28.829 --> 21:30.205
I'm telling Dean Rivers
about this,

21:30.288 --> 21:32.332
and both of you
are gonna get detention!

21:32.416 --> 21:33.792
[both laughing]

21:33.875 --> 21:38.588
- Then I guess we have
nothin' to lose.

21:38.672 --> 21:39.923
[everyone laughing]

21:40.007 --> 21:43.844
- Oh! No! No! No!

21:43.927 --> 21:45.721
Oh! Oh!

21:45.804 --> 21:48.432
- Aah!

21:48.515 --> 21:50.851

than a beauty pageant.

21:50.934 --> 21:53.186
- So much better.

21:53.270 --> 21:54.813
- It's so cold!

21:54.896 --> 21:57.065
Oh! No!

21:57.149 --> 21:58.233
Oh, my God!

21:58.317 --> 22:00.694
- Girls.
Always fightin' dirty.

22:00.777 --> 22:02.029
- [laughing]

22:04.990 --> 22:06.158
Fighting dirty...

22:06.241 --> 22:07.617
'cause they're muddy.

22:07.701 --> 22:09.578
I get it! That's funny!

22:09.661 --> 22:12.497
- It is?
- [laughing]

22:12.581 --> 22:16.168
- [laughing] Yeah,
that's right, it is.

22:16.251 --> 22:17.919
It sure is.

22:18.003 --> 22:21.715
You just laugh it up, Quinn,
compliments of Michael Barret.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.551
Whoo!

22:27.721 --> 22:30.515

- I know.

22:30.599 --> 22:33.435
But now he'll stop trying
to make me laugh.

22:33.518 --> 22:35.479
- Clever.

22:35.562 --> 22:38.482
- Ow! Ow!
Let go of me!

22:38.565 --> 22:40.067
I'm the judge!

22:40.150 --> 22:41.943
I'm the judge!
I'm the judge!

22:42.027 --> 22:44.321
- Poor Logan.

22:44.404 --> 22:46.365

pounded down there.

22:46.448 --> 22:48.492
{\an8}- Let go of me!
I'm the judge!

22:48.575 --> 22:51.203
