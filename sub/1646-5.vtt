WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:02.544
Previously on Prison Break:

00:02.627 --> 00:04.504
It was a meeting between
all six cardholders.

00:04.587 --> 00:06.965
Now we know who has
the other five cards.

00:07.048 --> 00:09.217
Your nose is bleeding.

00:10.802 --> 00:11.845
I'm Cole Pfeiffer.

00:11.928 --> 00:13.596
Welcome to Los Angeles.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.349
His name is Theodore Bagwell.
He was with us in Panama

00:16.433 --> 00:17.684
and now he's here
in Los Angeles.

00:17.767 --> 00:20.478
And he has a book that used
to belong to Whistler

00:20.562 --> 00:22.981
and Mahone thinks this book
has a plan for the break-in.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.692
Cole Pfeiffer did not arrive
for our meeting.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.485
You don't have Scylla?

00:29.279 --> 00:31.698
It seems your friend
Whistler wasn't the only one

00:31.781 --> 00:32.991
looking into Scylla.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.452
-You know anything about that?
-No.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.997
I'm looking for the man
who killed my son.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.874
This man is a
professional assassin.

00:40.957 --> 00:42.876
He's African American,
six-foot, four,

00:42.959 --> 00:44.753
about 220 pounds.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.156
We refined the image
as best we could,

01:13.239 --> 01:14.157
but we're going to need

01:14.240 --> 01:15.825
one of your specialists
to sharpen the video

01:15.909 --> 01:17.660
so we can I.D. the
rest of them.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.162
All right, I'll see
what I can do.

01:19.245 --> 01:21.498
But I've seen what those tech
guys are capable of.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.666
Sometimes, it's...

01:24.334 --> 01:26.002
Wait a sec,
I know this guy.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.128
This guy works
in my building.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.047
-That's Griffin Oren.
-You know him?

01:29.130 --> 01:30.090
I know of him.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.050
He's the head
of Treasury's L.A. bureau.

01:32.133 --> 01:34.052
Well, if he's in your building
you can get close to him.

01:34.135 --> 01:36.346
-I would need a reason.
-Well, you make something up.

01:36.429 --> 01:39.474
Something about al Qaeda using
stolen bearer bonds

01:39.557 --> 01:41.726
to finance shady
operations, whatever.

01:41.810 --> 01:44.104
Come on, making false claims
in matters affecting government?

01:44.187 --> 01:46.022
That's up to five
years in prison.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.691
Welcome to the
club, Agent Self.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.678
Thanks for meeting me.

02:16.761 --> 02:18.263
I would have come
out to see you,

02:18.346 --> 02:19.430
but I can't travel
that far...

02:19.514 --> 02:21.141
I'm sorry...

02:21.224 --> 02:24.185
but you said that you had
some pictures to show me.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.205
That's him.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.002
I'll get in
touch with you

02:49.085 --> 02:51.254
as soon as...

02:51.337 --> 02:56.134
as soon as... I find out...

02:57.468 --> 02:59.345
You didn't do this.

03:03.933 --> 03:06.311
In your heart, you are a really

03:06.394 --> 03:08.188
good man.

03:08.271 --> 03:11.900
That's why
I married you.

03:11.983 --> 03:15.320
That's why I started
a family with you.

03:22.994 --> 03:25.121
When you used to bring
your files home

03:25.205 --> 03:30.168
and I would beg you
to leave that stuff at work...

03:30.251 --> 03:33.796
but when you have
a monster in your sights...

03:35.465 --> 03:37.383
you can't focus

03:37.467 --> 03:40.303
until you get him.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.639
I used to hate
that about you.

03:42.722 --> 03:46.309
Right now it's the only
thing that lets me sleep,

03:46.392 --> 03:48.144
because I know...

03:48.228 --> 03:51.981
you're going to get him.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.334
♪ ♪

04:38.945 --> 04:41.281
What the hell are you doing?!

05:46.262 --> 05:48.014
What are you doing?

05:48.097 --> 05:50.266
Hey there, Blauney.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.642
Just, uh...

05:51.726 --> 05:52.894
doing a little research.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.103
GATE-related?

05:54.187 --> 05:56.564
I'm adding a little
flourish to my pitch.

05:56.647 --> 05:57.940
"Like the caged macaw

05:58.024 --> 05:59.942
who cannot spread her wings."

06:00.026 --> 06:01.152
You know, Cole...

06:01.235 --> 06:03.613
I was thinking maybe you should
spend a little less time

06:03.696 --> 06:05.239
practicing
and a little more time

06:05.323 --> 06:06.866
actually pitching.

06:06.949 --> 06:09.786
I mean, number one salesman
in the world?

06:09.869 --> 06:10.912
We're all just waiting
with bated breath

06:10.995 --> 06:13.206
to see what you can do
around here.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.216
Ouch.

07:00.294 --> 07:01.629
I know.

07:01.712 --> 07:04.173
We saw him right here.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.009
Hey.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.094
Hey.

07:08.177 --> 07:10.054
You haven't seen
Sara, have you?

07:10.138 --> 07:11.681
No.

07:11.764 --> 07:13.474
You want to end up
back in Fox River,

07:13.558 --> 07:15.435
you just go
right ahead.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.438
Hey, what's going on?

07:18.521 --> 07:20.523
-He wants to look for T-Bag.
-You're damn right I want to look for him.

07:20.606 --> 07:21.899
We know he's got the bird book.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.901
We know the bird book's got
the plan for the break-in.

07:23.985 --> 07:27.196
And we saw that snake
right here today.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.865
All I'm saying is,
it ain't safe

07:28.948 --> 07:31.617
for a member of the Fox River
Eight to be out there looking

07:31.701 --> 07:34.829
-for another member of the Fox River Eight.
-Yes, but...

07:34.912 --> 07:36.914
Bellick, I want you
to go with Sucre,

07:36.998 --> 07:38.833
canvass the area, see if you can
get a lead on him.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.293
There are like six
big buildings over there.

07:40.376 --> 07:41.669
He could be in
any one of them.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.337
That's why it's
called canvassing.

07:50.678 --> 07:52.805
You do realize this is the
Treasury Department, right?

07:52.889 --> 07:54.807
You tell Self to go
down a few floors,

07:54.891 --> 07:56.767
walk past the right computers

07:56.851 --> 07:58.394
and we are billionaires.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.979
Just the card, please.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.862
Don Self, Homeland Security.

08:07.945 --> 08:09.447
-I need to see Mr. Oren right away.
-He's not available.

08:09.530 --> 08:10.698
Ma'am, I need to see him

08:10.781 --> 08:12.575
right away, otherwise
hundreds of American lives

08:12.658 --> 08:14.076
will be in jeopardy.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.537
Don Self, Homeland Security.

08:16.621 --> 08:17.747
Talk to Angela
down the hall.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.332
Sir, I'm sorry
to barge in here,

08:19.415 --> 08:20.416
but this is urgent.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.626
I'm sure it is.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.044
Talk to Angela down the hall.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.629
Sir, we are hearing chatter
about some stolen bearer bonds,

08:24.712 --> 08:27.006
and we have reason to believe
that al Qaeda operatives...

08:27.089 --> 08:28.508
You have serial numbers?

08:28.591 --> 08:30.635
No, I do not.

08:39.560 --> 08:40.811
Mind turning around?

08:40.895 --> 08:42.980
Not at all.

08:52.740 --> 08:55.493
I leave for Asia in six hours.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.036
He's got it.

08:59.997 --> 09:01.707
Until then...

09:01.791 --> 09:04.001
I've got meetings with
the bureau chiefs

09:04.085 --> 09:07.547
of the FBI, the CIA
and Homeland Security.

09:07.630 --> 09:08.839
It's gone.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.009
If what you tell me
is actually important,

09:12.093 --> 09:13.844
I'll hear about it
from your boss.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.264
Until then...

09:16.347 --> 09:18.474
talk to Angela
down the hall.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.767
And if you set foot

09:19.850 --> 09:21.644
in my office again
without my prior consent,

09:21.727 --> 09:23.479
I will see to it that
you spend the rest

09:23.563 --> 09:25.982
of your career running
border security in Alaska.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.655
Did we get it?

09:32.738 --> 09:33.823
What happened?

09:33.906 --> 09:35.157
What do you mean
what happened?

09:35.241 --> 09:37.451
We had it for two seconds
and then it disappeared.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.537
It's in the safe.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.205
He has this crazy
safe in his office.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.832
That must have been
blocking the transmission.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.584
I'll bet you that's where
he keeps the card.

09:44.667 --> 09:45.960
So we need
to get into that safe.

09:46.043 --> 09:47.420
Trust me, there's no way
to crack that thing.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.630
Look, I'll have the enhanced
images of the other cardholders

09:49.714 --> 09:51.674
in a couple of hours--
we'll go from there.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.343
You can access the building's
blueprints, right?

09:54.427 --> 09:55.636
I can't go back up there.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.346
No one's asking you.
We'll take care of that.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.015
Come on, you'll never
get past the front door, okay?

09:59.098 --> 10:00.808
Even if they don't
recognize you,

10:00.891 --> 10:02.852
you need a security card
that matches...

10:02.935 --> 10:04.937
Just get the blueprints
and get back here, all right?

10:05.021 --> 10:06.063
Yeah...

10:08.774 --> 10:10.443
Sara, what happened?

10:10.526 --> 10:12.445
I'm fine, but someone
was following me.

10:12.528 --> 10:13.696
I lost him about a mile back.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.489
I don't think there's any way
he could have followed me here.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.283
-I made sure of that.
-What'd he look like?

10:17.366 --> 10:19.493
Uh, tall, black. He had a beard.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.370
Is this the guy?

10:23.873 --> 10:24.832
Yeah.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.668
Who's that?

10:27.752 --> 10:30.129
That's the man
who killed my son.

10:31.797 --> 10:35.134
Now he's come to kill us.

10:39.639 --> 10:43.309
Where were you the first time
that you saw him?

10:44.477 --> 10:45.478
The very first time?

10:45.561 --> 10:46.646
Walking home.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.773
He didn't just run into
you on the street?

10:48.856 --> 10:50.733
Where were you before that?

10:51.150 --> 10:53.361
The Towne Lounge.

10:53.444 --> 10:54.820
Is that a bar?

10:54.904 --> 10:56.739
Do you have a problem with that?

10:56.822 --> 11:01.160
No, I just want to know
how long you were there.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.578
Sara,

11:02.662 --> 11:05.331
I need to find this guy and I
can't do it without your help.

11:05.414 --> 11:07.667
I don't care why or what you
were doing in the bar.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.627
I just really want to know
how long you were there.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.087
Okay. A couple hours.

11:11.170 --> 11:14.799
Thank you. So something
must have tipped him off.

11:14.882 --> 11:15.883
You paid cash, right?

11:15.966 --> 11:17.885
Of course.

11:17.968 --> 11:20.346
But the credit card
that Bruce gave me is gone.

11:20.930 --> 11:23.307
What credit card?

11:24.725 --> 11:27.186
These are the security
checkpoints.

11:27.269 --> 11:30.314
You can't get past one of those
unless you have one of these.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.607
Any way
we can forge it?

11:31.691 --> 11:33.609
Sure, if you have two weeks
and access

11:33.693 --> 11:35.236
to the building's mainframe
maybe.

11:35.319 --> 11:37.905
Well, doesn't look like there
are any security checkpoints

11:37.988 --> 11:39.907
on the tenth floor.
No, just that

11:39.990 --> 11:41.409
all the access points
to the tenth floor.

11:41.492 --> 11:42.743
But if you could
somehow magically appear

11:42.827 --> 11:44.829
and wind up in the middle
of the hallway, you'd be fine,

11:44.912 --> 11:46.664
except for all the government
officials who'd be swarming

11:46.747 --> 11:48.040
around and who would
arrest you in a heartbeat.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.501
And if you can get us into
the parking structure,

11:50.584 --> 11:51.544
will security
check our van?

11:51.627 --> 11:54.630
Sure. Transporting known felons,
why not?

11:54.714 --> 11:56.048
The parking structure.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.216
This is our
point of entry.

11:57.299 --> 11:58.884
We need the details
to the safe.

12:02.221 --> 12:07.643
Okay, the, um, the safe
has an insignia on it.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.688
It looks something
like this.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.701
You're gonna need
some of this.

12:41.594 --> 12:45.306
I got a positive ID
of Sara Tancredi in Los Angeles.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.640
That means Michael Scofield
was here.

12:46.724 --> 12:50.853
That means Lincoln
Burrows is here. Why?

12:50.936 --> 12:53.105
Sara, huh?

12:54.356 --> 12:57.318
She's a slippery little bitch,
isn't she?

12:58.444 --> 13:02.698
Time is not on your side,
Gretchen.

13:03.699 --> 13:05.701
Maybe you hadn't noticed,

13:05.785 --> 13:08.329
but since you seem
to be somewhat immune

13:08.412 --> 13:11.332
to physical coercion,

13:11.415 --> 13:14.835
we've decided to move on.

13:17.421 --> 13:20.633
The nose is
an evolutionary marvel.

13:20.716 --> 13:24.970
Our brain has been constructed
so that certain aromas...

13:26.263 --> 13:31.393
...coffee beans, blueberries
that are helpful to our body,

13:31.477 --> 13:33.354
we perceive
as pleasant.

13:33.437 --> 13:37.525
Whereas other smells
that signify death,

13:37.608 --> 13:41.195
disease...

13:41.278 --> 13:43.906
Initial symptoms include
nausea, dizziness,

13:43.989 --> 13:47.827
burning eyes, all of which
you are experiencing right now.

13:47.910 --> 13:51.038
Prolonged exposure will
lead to faintness,

13:51.121 --> 13:53.749
rapid degradation
of your mental faculties.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.002
Tell me.

13:57.086 --> 14:01.006
I don't know anything.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.927
You've got one more day.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.282
Top of the line.

14:26.365 --> 14:27.741
It's a biometric design,

14:27.825 --> 14:29.869
and only Oren's fingerprint
will open it.

14:29.952 --> 14:33.330
So we lift his prints off
something he touched.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.374
The pad knows what
human skin feels like.

14:35.457 --> 14:37.835
If we try to trick it,
we'll set off the alarm.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.962
And then there's
the 12-digit key code.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.130
What about the hinges?

14:41.213 --> 14:42.256
Wired to the alarm.

14:42.339 --> 14:43.382
We drill it.

14:43.465 --> 14:44.925
Through the outer
layer of steel maybe,

14:45.009 --> 14:47.094
but the bones of this thing
are three-quarters inch

14:47.177 --> 14:48.762
cobalt alloy hard plate.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.265
Drilling's not gonna work,
not in our time frame.

14:51.348 --> 14:52.933
All right, so basically,
we have a way to get you

14:53.017 --> 14:55.060
into the garage, which, in case
you guys forgot,

14:55.144 --> 14:57.354
that puts me on the hook
for another four charges.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.607
But no way to get you up
to the tenth floor.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.567
But let's say you do get
up to the tenth floor.

15:01.650 --> 15:04.111
Then we need to get you
into Oren's office for an hour

15:04.194 --> 15:05.112
during the middle
of the day.

15:05.195 --> 15:06.780
Then, we need to hope

15:06.864 --> 15:08.032
that not one of Oren's
co-workers is gonna hear

15:08.115 --> 15:10.284
the extremely loud drill
that you're gonna be using

15:10.367 --> 15:12.369
to break into a safe
that I'm telling you

15:12.453 --> 15:13.829
cannot be broken into.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.581
Do you understand
there are Homeland agents

15:15.664 --> 15:17.708
whose sole job is to design
safety measures

15:17.791 --> 15:19.710
to make this structure
impregnable.

15:19.793 --> 15:23.547
Yeah. They had those guys
at Fox River, too.

15:25.424 --> 15:26.425
Whose office is this?

15:26.508 --> 15:28.594
Sam Middleton,
Department of Justice.

15:28.677 --> 15:31.388
This wall separates
Middleton from Oren.

15:32.681 --> 15:34.600
I'm gonna need some supplies.

15:36.352 --> 15:39.146
The credit card was used
at the bar at 10:32.

15:39.229 --> 15:40.606
What time
did you see him?

15:40.689 --> 15:41.690
About 11:00.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.609
And how long were you
walking at that time?

15:44.818 --> 15:46.028
Ten, 15 minutes.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.530
Let's assume that he was at his
place when we received the call.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.492
That's an 18-minute drive

15:51.575 --> 15:53.619
from the Towne Lounge Bar
in San Pedro.

15:53.702 --> 15:55.621
Averaging 30 miles an hour
the whole way,

15:55.704 --> 15:57.915
that's a,
that's a nine-mile radius.

15:57.998 --> 15:59.833
So he's gonna be somewhere
around the perimeter

15:59.917 --> 16:01.877
of that circle.
He's got to be mobile

16:01.961 --> 16:04.129
within a half mile
of a major freeway.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.965
The 10, the 110,
the 405.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.759
No permanent address,
so we're looking for hotels, right?

16:08.842 --> 16:10.761
Yeah, but nowhere where you need
to valet your car.

16:10.844 --> 16:13.097
It's got to be readily
accessible at all times.

16:13.180 --> 16:14.598
And somewhere you don't need

16:14.682 --> 16:17.184
to put a credit card down
for incidentals. You got that?

16:17.267 --> 16:18.644
I'll see what I can do.

16:19.937 --> 16:20.813
Hurry.

16:24.566 --> 16:28.487
Trishanne, I'm gonna need a mug
of tea with lemon.

16:28.570 --> 16:31.573
I'm sorry, Cole. I can't leave
the desk right now.

16:32.950 --> 16:36.745
Good help is so hard to find.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.460
May I help you?

16:43.544 --> 16:44.753
We're with Upper Valley
Insurance.

16:44.837 --> 16:48.716
And this man just came into
a $100,000 inheritance.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.551
We can't track him down,
so we're offering

16:50.634 --> 16:52.636
a ten percent finder's fee

16:52.720 --> 16:55.055
to anyone who can point
us in his direction.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.975
Oh, my gosh. What, $10,000?

16:58.058 --> 16:58.976
Yeah.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.066
Um...

17:07.317 --> 17:08.861
Mm...

17:12.489 --> 17:15.200
I'm sorry.
I don't recognize him.

17:15.284 --> 17:20.914
Okay, so if you do see him, would you
please give us a call?

17:20.998 --> 17:22.082
Thank you.

17:24.084 --> 17:25.252
"GATE"?

17:25.335 --> 17:27.129
"Greatness Achieved
Through Excellence."

17:27.212 --> 17:28.964
Hmm.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.150
A toy?

17:48.233 --> 17:49.526
You want to try
to explain this?

17:49.610 --> 17:51.445
Mix aluminum powder
with iron oxide.

17:51.528 --> 17:52.946
Add a little heat.

17:56.658 --> 17:59.870
Hey. Yeah, well, thanks
for calling me back, Sam.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.917
Yeah. No, I just, I know you
have these trial dates coming up

18:05.000 --> 18:07.127
and we just want to make sure
you have everything you need

18:07.211 --> 18:09.338
to convict
these bastards.

18:09.421 --> 18:13.175
Okay, that's terrific.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.010
All right, I'll
see you then.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.512
All right,

18:16.595 --> 18:17.888
we're gonna have lunch.

18:17.971 --> 18:19.973
I'll keep him out of his office
for as long as I can.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.934
Good luck.

18:22.976 --> 18:24.561
All right.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.528
Hello.
Hey, any sign of him?

18:32.611 --> 18:33.987
No, we checked about
ten buildings,

18:34.071 --> 18:35.114
but nothing so far.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.491
Well, scrap it; we're going
after the next card.

18:37.574 --> 18:40.077
Meet me on the corner of
Santa Monica and Century West.

18:56.426 --> 18:57.344
Hey, Charlie.

18:57.427 --> 18:58.595
Yankees lost again
last night.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.514
Yeah, well, at least
our fans show up

19:00.597 --> 19:02.266
before the fifth
inning, right?

19:02.349 --> 19:03.475
Have a good day,
all right, Charlie?

19:03.559 --> 19:05.561
You, too, Mr. Self.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.371
I'm letting you guys know
right now.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.540
If you get busted,
don't mention my name.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.809
We're ready.

20:14.004 --> 20:16.089
Now.

20:18.383 --> 20:21.428
One, two, three.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.102
So...

20:29.186 --> 20:32.314
a couple of scruffy guys
walk in,

20:32.397 --> 20:34.942
tell me they're from
the insurance company

20:35.025 --> 20:40.113
and they offer me $10,000
if I know where you are.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.991
Something tells me
there's a better offer on the table.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.286
Well, I'll be, Trishanne.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.413
You just caught yourself
a leprechaun.

20:48.497 --> 20:49.790
And as the legend goes,

20:49.873 --> 20:52.834
you got yourself one wish,
anything in the world.

20:52.918 --> 20:53.919
Oh, really?

20:54.002 --> 20:55.212
And I am bound
to grant it.

20:55.295 --> 20:56.922
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

20:57.005 --> 20:59.883
Well, your commencement check's
sitting on my desk

20:59.967 --> 21:00.926
waiting to be signed.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.928
That's a pretty nice
pot of gold.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.723
Before you say another word...

21:07.683 --> 21:09.601
Now, it's true

21:09.685 --> 21:12.354
leprechauns cannot refuse
their captor's demands,

21:12.437 --> 21:14.856
but if they deem her

21:14.940 --> 21:16.650
to be greedy or covetous,

21:16.733 --> 21:20.279
whatever she desires will
certainly be accompanied

21:20.362 --> 21:23.365
with disastrous tidings.

21:24.908 --> 21:28.287
Or so the legend goes.

21:29.496 --> 21:30.914
Three percent of your commission

21:31.707 --> 21:34.126
from here on out.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.713
Done.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.387
Don Self to see you.

21:46.388 --> 21:47.514
You can go
right on in.

21:47.597 --> 21:49.016
Thank you. Have a great day.

21:49.099 --> 21:51.018
You, too.

21:53.186 --> 21:54.021
Hey, hey.

21:54.646 --> 21:55.731
Hey, Sam.

21:56.898 --> 21:57.899
Great to
meet you.

21:57.983 --> 21:58.984
Same here.

21:59.067 --> 22:01.028
Oh, thanks again
for squeezing me in

22:01.111 --> 22:02.029
on such short notice.

22:02.112 --> 22:02.946
I figure we had so much

22:03.030 --> 22:05.532
to get through, this'd
be the best way.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.200
I-I thought we were
going out for lunch.

22:07.909 --> 22:09.036
Is there a problem?

22:10.412 --> 22:11.580
Well...

22:11.663 --> 22:12.706
actually, um...

22:12.789 --> 22:13.957
I'm a vegetarian.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.500
It's a new diet,
b-b-but there's

22:15.584 --> 22:17.210
a great place
down the street,

22:17.294 --> 22:18.795
and it'll be my treat.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.341
Elise.
Yes, sir?

22:22.424 --> 22:24.509
I'm heading out for lunch.

22:50.118 --> 22:51.995
Hold it there.

22:55.499 --> 22:56.833
Sorry, I was
just coming in to...

22:57.667 --> 22:59.503
There's no more TP
in the ladies room.

22:59.920 --> 23:00.962
We'll get right on that.

23:01.421 --> 23:03.256
How about you get it right now?

23:03.340 --> 23:04.883
Uh...

23:08.804 --> 23:10.931
Best we got in here.

23:29.908 --> 23:32.411
You guys need to get
better organized.

23:48.718 --> 23:51.430
53 hotels match
the search criteria.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.853
You know I read,
I read this article

23:57.936 --> 23:59.229
a little while ago, right?

23:59.312 --> 24:02.357
About the whole, uh,
nature versus nurture thing,

24:02.441 --> 24:05.068
and it turns out,
it's all kind of a mishmash

24:05.152 --> 24:07.487
because DNA trumps everything.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.115
And I believe it, because

24:10.198 --> 24:12.534
I mean, I grew up
in the same house,

24:12.617 --> 24:14.911
uh, went to the same school
as my brother,

24:14.995 --> 24:16.496
who's a math professor,

24:16.580 --> 24:17.998
My sister's a pediatrician.

24:18.081 --> 24:19.875
And I'm a thief
who blows his money

24:19.958 --> 24:21.710
on hookers
and coke.

24:21.793 --> 24:24.254
So, like the same way Scofield's
hardwired to be a genius,

24:24.337 --> 24:26.882
and you are always gonna
be a lawman, right?

24:26.965 --> 24:28.300
I mean, whoever
this guy is,

24:28.383 --> 24:30.677
-you think he wanted to grow up to be a murderer?
-Probably not.

24:33.054 --> 24:35.098
Be very careful
choosing the next words

24:35.182 --> 24:37.267
that come out of your mouth.

24:42.189 --> 24:45.025
I... I'm just saying.

24:45.108 --> 24:47.402
We are who we are.

24:59.289 --> 25:01.291
Oh, man.

25:04.044 --> 25:08.298
Jake. I'm gonna need you
in front of room 1018. Now.

25:08.381 --> 25:09.841
What's going on?
I apologize, ma'am,

25:09.925 --> 25:11.092
but we're gonna be in your way

25:11.176 --> 25:14.054
for the next 90 minutes or so.

25:14.137 --> 25:15.347
Black?

25:15.430 --> 25:16.306
Yeah.

25:16.389 --> 25:17.349
Excuse me, ma'am,

25:17.432 --> 25:19.226
but where can I plug in?

25:19.309 --> 25:20.977
For now, you can go in there,

25:21.061 --> 25:22.771
but when my boss gets
back from lunch,

25:22.854 --> 25:24.397
you're gonna...

25:52.968 --> 25:55.095
The safe should be
somewhere behind this wall.

26:27.127 --> 26:29.129
As soon as you're
through the steel,

26:29.212 --> 26:30.714
I'll have the thermite ready.

26:35.969 --> 26:37.095
What is it?

26:37.178 --> 26:39.055
How long has it been happening?

26:39.139 --> 26:40.932
It's not a big deal.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.058
It was a big deal
when you were 13.

26:42.142 --> 26:43.560
Promise me you won't tell Sara.

26:43.643 --> 26:44.686
Sara's a doctor.
She can help.

26:44.769 --> 26:48.106
Look, I acclimating to the
warmer climate, all right?

26:48.189 --> 26:50.984
Come on.
We've got work to do.

26:51.693 --> 26:53.361
Let's go.

26:58.825 --> 27:01.620
I don't know what this company
is up to, but it sure

27:01.703 --> 27:04.331
sounds like there's a whole
lot of money involved.

27:05.540 --> 27:07.000
Yeah. I don't know.

27:08.543 --> 27:11.463
Lisa Tabak just hopped a flight
to Laos, didn't she?

27:11.546 --> 27:12.464
Yeah, I guess.

27:12.547 --> 27:13.923
And now Griffin Oren just said

27:14.007 --> 27:16.343
he was going somewhere in Asia.

27:26.978 --> 27:28.021
Down to the cobalt.

27:28.104 --> 27:29.481
Right.

27:55.715 --> 27:57.050
What can I get you?

27:57.133 --> 27:58.218
Just a moment of your time.

27:58.301 --> 27:59.260
I'm a private
investigator,

27:59.344 --> 28:00.804
and I'm working
with a woman

28:00.887 --> 28:02.055
named Sara Tancredi,

28:02.138 --> 28:03.973
and she was recently
a patron of yours.

28:04.057 --> 28:05.558
I don't want
to get involved.

28:07.352 --> 28:08.895
She moved all the way
across the country

28:08.978 --> 28:11.314
to get away from this guy.

28:12.315 --> 28:15.902
Help me find him before
he finds her.

28:18.988 --> 28:22.200
Last time,
Sara had a broken jaw.

28:27.288 --> 28:29.541
I was standing by the
front door when he left.

28:29.624 --> 28:31.042
A second later
I saw him come past,

28:31.126 --> 28:32.168
take something out of his car.

28:32.252 --> 28:33.670
Do you remember what
the car looked like?

28:33.753 --> 28:38.591
Gray. A sedan, sort of like one
of those rental cars, you know?

28:49.936 --> 28:52.230
You need something?

28:53.565 --> 28:55.191
Just a small...

28:55.275 --> 28:58.361
kindness.

29:03.408 --> 29:06.453
That's the easiest
$300 you'll ever make.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.339
Hey, hey, hey.

29:18.423 --> 29:20.216
We're working here.

29:22.886 --> 29:24.596
So am I.

29:24.679 --> 29:26.055
There's a stack
of letters

29:26.139 --> 29:27.682
that I need to put in the mail.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.351
The chemicals, they don't react
so good with leather.

29:30.435 --> 29:31.603
What are you using, lye?

29:31.686 --> 29:32.979
Wait, wait, wait.

29:34.522 --> 29:35.982
Listen, we...

29:36.065 --> 29:37.066
we know this is a hassle.

29:37.150 --> 29:38.526
We know we're
disrupting your work

29:38.610 --> 29:39.652
and giving you
a headache.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.488
We annoy a different person
every day,

29:41.571 --> 29:43.865
but if this gets dirty
while it's still wet,

29:43.948 --> 29:45.575
it's gonna leave a stain,

29:45.658 --> 29:47.160
and... and, uh,
and then we'll be

29:47.243 --> 29:48.244
back here all over again.

29:48.328 --> 29:50.789
Why don't you just
tell me where they are

29:50.872 --> 29:51.998
and I'll get
them for you?

29:52.081 --> 29:56.252
On the corner of his desk
near his computer.

29:58.963 --> 30:00.423
How much longer?

30:00.507 --> 30:03.468
Another couple of minutes,
and we'll be ready to copy.

30:23.321 --> 30:24.364
Is Griffin in?

30:24.447 --> 30:25.490
He's in a meeting
right now...

30:25.573 --> 30:28.952
but I can pull him
out if you'd like.

30:29.035 --> 30:30.078
If you could.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.788
Just have a seat
in his office.

30:31.871 --> 30:33.665
He'll be right
with you.

30:42.048 --> 30:43.758
All we need is one more.

30:49.931 --> 30:52.267
Someone's in there.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.335
If I could hear him
sitting down, there's no way

31:19.419 --> 31:20.461
he's not gonna hear the drill.

31:20.545 --> 31:21.588
You can do it manually.

31:21.671 --> 31:23.631
Won't generate enough heat
to activate the thermite.

31:23.715 --> 31:26.259
Come on, man, we're like a 16th
of an inch away from this.

32:08.009 --> 32:09.052
Can I help you?

32:09.135 --> 32:10.970
I phoned earlier about
one of your guests.

32:11.054 --> 32:12.680
Gray sedan, right?

32:12.764 --> 32:14.933
Yeah, right.

32:16.392 --> 32:18.645
Is that the guy?

32:20.063 --> 32:21.147
Yeah, that's him.

32:22.732 --> 32:23.733
What room?

32:23.816 --> 32:24.943
He was in 130.

32:25.026 --> 32:27.528
He checked out.

32:30.740 --> 32:31.991
Did, um...

32:32.075 --> 32:35.244
did he leave any clue
as to where he was going?

32:40.917 --> 32:42.752
Do you mind if I look
at the room?

32:42.835 --> 32:44.545
$19 an hour,
$59 for the night.

32:44.629 --> 32:48.007
Fine, whatever, give me a key.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.034
Yes.

33:15.118 --> 33:17.370
You wanted to know if anyone
came looking for you.

33:17.453 --> 33:18.413
Did they?

33:21.833 --> 33:24.335
No. I was just calling
to let you know

33:24.419 --> 33:25.378
my shift was ending

33:25.461 --> 33:27.255
and nobody showed up.
All right.

33:27.338 --> 33:28.965
Thank you.

33:30.717 --> 33:31.843
What do you say you give me

33:31.926 --> 33:33.302
that little piece of paper
in your hand?

33:33.386 --> 33:34.804
How's that sound, huh?

33:41.310 --> 33:42.353
Sorry for keeping you.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.731
To what do I owe the pleasure?

33:44.814 --> 33:46.733
Just making sure you're ready
for your trip.

33:46.816 --> 33:49.402
Well, I better be.
I'm leaving in five minutes.

33:50.820 --> 33:52.572
All right,
maybe if we dial it down

33:52.655 --> 33:53.698
to the lowest setting,
that might work.

33:53.781 --> 33:55.450
Sure?
We don't have a choice.

33:55.533 --> 33:56.868
I'll tell you when.

33:56.951 --> 33:59.454
The finance minister's
anxiously awaiting your arrival.

33:59.537 --> 34:02.457
Well, if you recall,
I successfully negotiated

34:02.540 --> 34:06.294
financial policies with the IMF
and World Bank.

34:06.669 --> 34:09.130
Pretty sure I can handle Laos.

34:09.213 --> 34:10.506
Now.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.726
I'm well aware of your resume,
Griffin.

34:21.809 --> 34:23.519
Got it.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.121
We're in.

34:42.205 --> 34:44.624
- Got it.
- The runaway inflation in Laos

34:44.707 --> 34:45.917
has given way to food riots

34:46.000 --> 34:48.920
in the capital city of
Vientiane,

34:49.003 --> 34:52.548
where the death toll
has risen over 200.

35:11.734 --> 35:14.946
The monetary policy
is a means to an end.

35:15.029 --> 35:17.615
I'm aware of our final
objective, General.

35:17.698 --> 35:19.826
This is an important day for us.

35:19.909 --> 35:23.830
I need to make sure that
everyone knows his role.

35:23.913 --> 35:26.249
You could've told me all of this
on the telephone.

35:26.332 --> 35:29.961
Why did you take today of all
days to come down here

35:30.044 --> 35:30.962
and berate me in person?

35:31.045 --> 35:32.797
Things have happened
in the past few days

35:32.880 --> 35:35.550
that have made me
somewhat uneasy.

35:35.633 --> 35:36.968
Today we got confirmation

35:37.051 --> 35:40.304
that one of our targets
is in Los Angeles.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.098
That on top of the fact,

35:42.181 --> 35:44.517
that one of Lisa's bodyguards
was killed.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.687
I thought that was because
she was married to that Turk.

35:47.770 --> 35:49.313
That's the
official story.

35:49.397 --> 35:50.565
What is it then?

35:53.276 --> 35:54.569
Come on, come on.

35:55.945 --> 35:58.322
Do you have your card on you,
Griffin?

35:58.406 --> 35:59.448
Of course.

35:59.532 --> 36:00.575
I'd like to see it.

36:00.658 --> 36:02.535
Where are we?

36:02.618 --> 36:04.203
Talk to me Roland.

36:04.287 --> 36:05.496
72%.

36:05.580 --> 36:06.581
I put it in my safe
this morning.

36:06.664 --> 36:09.083
I'd like to see it.

36:38.279 --> 36:39.197
86.

36:39.280 --> 36:40.823
87.

36:48.414 --> 36:49.916
92.

36:49.999 --> 36:53.628
15 years working together,
you think you'd trust me.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.630
Don't turn this into an opera.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.256
Just hand me the card.

36:58.507 --> 36:59.592
Come on, come on.

37:12.855 --> 37:14.023
Happy?

37:14.106 --> 37:15.775
From now on, I'm asking

37:15.858 --> 37:18.277
that everyone keep
their card on them

37:18.361 --> 37:19.487
at all times.

37:19.570 --> 37:20.780
Anyone makes a move,

37:20.863 --> 37:23.532
anything goes missing,
you call me.

37:27.870 --> 37:29.413
Did we get it?

37:29.497 --> 37:31.540
100.
Yeah.

37:34.043 --> 37:35.836
I don't know how you eat
that crap, Don.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.964
-What was that called? Tempeh?
-Yeah.

37:38.047 --> 37:39.757
It looked like you could
barely choke it down.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.009
Yeah, well, it's an
acquired taste.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.928
Excuse us.

37:45.054 --> 37:45.972
All right, well,

37:46.055 --> 37:47.640
it looks like I should be
getting back to work.

37:47.723 --> 37:49.225
Oh.
This was a pleasure.

38:11.038 --> 38:13.708
Apparently, billions in counterfeit currency
flooded the economy,

38:13.791 --> 38:15.793
which is what
caused it all.

38:15.876 --> 38:17.795
What I don't understand
is why?

38:17.878 --> 38:19.839
I mean, so far all
the cardholders

38:19.922 --> 38:21.424
have been experts in
their fields, right?

38:21.507 --> 38:23.092
In energy
and logistics

38:23.175 --> 38:25.136
and finance.

38:25.219 --> 38:26.178
I mean, it looks like

38:26.262 --> 38:28.556
they're just trying to
tear the country down.

38:28.639 --> 38:31.517
So they can profit
by rebuilding it.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.936
So the question is:
what's next?

38:38.107 --> 38:40.818
I was at a bar earlier.

38:42.778 --> 38:43.946
And nothing happened,
and I didn't drink.

38:44.030 --> 38:45.865
But...
Look, if-if this is too much for you...

38:45.948 --> 38:47.033
No. No.

38:47.116 --> 38:48.743
Because, say the word, and we'll
scrap the whole thing.

38:48.826 --> 38:50.870
That's a promise.
It's not going to happen again.

38:50.953 --> 38:54.874
But it would be a lie
not to tell you, and I...

38:54.957 --> 38:58.252
want you to know that
I'll never lie to you.

39:01.297 --> 39:03.049
I'm sorry.

39:16.812 --> 39:19.023
Somebody's here for you.

39:19.106 --> 39:21.192
For me?

39:24.862 --> 39:27.114
Cole Pfeiffer.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.288
Is your name Xing?

39:34.372 --> 39:37.208
Mr. Xing stayed behind
in New York.

39:38.709 --> 39:40.711
Well, have a seat then, uh--

39:40.795 --> 39:43.005
What can I help you with?

39:46.842 --> 39:49.762
You were supposed to
deliver the item two days ago.

39:49.845 --> 39:50.846
Where is it?

39:50.930 --> 39:52.598
Where's what?

39:52.681 --> 39:54.600
I've traveled a long
way, Mr. Pfeiffer.

39:54.683 --> 39:56.352
My patience is
wearing thin.

39:56.435 --> 39:59.688
Playing games is not going to
be good for either of us.

39:59.772 --> 40:02.566
Scylla. Where is it?

40:05.903 --> 40:07.196
Mr. Pfeiffer?
I'm at work.

40:07.279 --> 40:09.615
It's not exactly like
I can talk freely, you know.

40:09.698 --> 40:11.283
Just-just tell me the latest.

40:11.367 --> 40:12.326
The latest?

40:12.410 --> 40:13.369
If you deliver it

40:13.452 --> 40:15.955
to me by the end
of the day,

40:16.038 --> 40:18.624
I will pay you the sum
that we agreed upon.

40:18.707 --> 40:20.709
As much as I'd like to tell you
that were possible...

40:20.793 --> 40:22.211
Get it to me
by tomorrow

40:22.294 --> 40:23.629
and you will receive
50% of your fee.

40:23.712 --> 40:26.340
Two days, 25%.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.384
Three days,

40:28.467 --> 40:29.718
I shoot you through the brain.

40:29.802 --> 40:32.138
That is the latest.

40:33.514 --> 40:35.891
No problem.

41:07.590 --> 41:10.384
I thought that urine might
be getting a little stale.

41:10.718 --> 41:12.595
So I brought you
some more.

41:52.801 --> 41:56.138
Hey, the image enhancement
from the video came back.

41:56.222 --> 41:57.473
Did you get what I sent over?

41:57.556 --> 41:58.933
Yeah we got
all three cardholders.

41:59.016 --> 42:00.476
Yeah, well, for the first two,

42:00.559 --> 42:01.727
we have names, addresses--

42:01.810 --> 42:02.937
everything we need to grab them.

42:03.812 --> 42:05.022
Sara.

42:12.821 --> 42:15.282
But for the General...
we got nothing.

42:15.366 --> 42:17.159
This guy's a ghost.

42:21.330 --> 42:23.165
You all right?

42:29.922 --> 42:32.299
Look, most of what happened to
me in Panama is a total blank.

42:32.383 --> 42:33.592
But, um,

42:33.676 --> 42:35.052
when I was being held,
I could hear

42:35.135 --> 42:36.595
Gretchen talking on the phone,
in the next room.

42:36.679 --> 42:37.596
And she was
taking orders

42:37.680 --> 42:39.390
from the guy in charge.

42:39.473 --> 42:41.392
And she called him the General.

42:41.475 --> 42:42.851
In charge of the mission?

42:42.935 --> 42:45.771
No, I think in charge
of the Company.

42:50.192 --> 42:52.403
I told you...

42:53.028 --> 42:54.113
we should have
killed Gretchen

42:54.196 --> 42:56.991
when we had the chance.

42:57.324 --> 42:59.201
She'll come home.

42:59.660 --> 43:01.328
She always has.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.581
You better be sure about that.

43:04.748 --> 43:05.833
Excuse me, sir?

43:05.916 --> 43:07.042
What?

43:08.043 --> 43:09.044
Someone at Homeland
Security

43:09.128 --> 43:10.838
did an enhanced image
search on you today.

43:10.921 --> 43:12.464
We couldn't tell
where the original picture...

43:12.548 --> 43:13.507
Who?

43:14.091 --> 43:15.092
The guy who ordered it...

43:15.175 --> 43:17.261
his name is Don Self.

44:00.095 --> 44:02.097
Captioned by Point.360
