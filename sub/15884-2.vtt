Jaqueline?

00:08.032 --> 00:09.236
No, I don't know. What?

00:09.271 --> 00:11.239
You need to think about
yourself sometimes,

00:11.274 --> 00:12.574
before you start
insinuating yourself

00:12.609 --> 00:13.809
in other people's business.

00:13.843 --> 00:15.681
Well, you know what,
Deenyce?

00:15.715 --> 00:17.118
I'm gonna insinuate myself

00:17.153 --> 00:18.321
whenever and wherever
I please,

00:18.355 --> 00:20.056
'cause it's

Okay, so we gonna--here, baby.

00:30.338 --> 00:32.372
Bring it on then, bitch.
Let's go.

00:32.406 --> 00:34.108
I ain't even playin'.

00:34.142 --> 00:35.376
'cause you know what?

00:35.410 --> 00:36.845
- Step to me then, go ahead.
- I wish you would...

00:36.879 --> 00:38.047
- Step to me.
- Step up...

00:38.081 --> 00:39.148
No, I would love for you
to step to me,

00:39.182 --> 00:40.518
- I really would.
- To me right now, bitch.

00:40.553 --> 00:41.888
But you're just talkin',
that's the problem.

00:41.922 --> 00:43.525
I don't even care no more.

00:43.559 --> 00:45.295
And you're talking though,
and that's all you're doing.

00:45.329 --> 00:47.865
- Call me a bitch again.
- Oh, yeah?

00:47.899 --> 00:49.033
- Call me a bitch again.
- Okay.

00:49.067 --> 00:50.034
- No, see what happens.
- Your wish is granted.

00:50.069 --> 00:51.036
See what happens.

00:51.070 --> 00:52.171
I would like
to see what happens.

00:52.206 --> 00:55.677
I would love to see
what happens.

00:55.712 --> 00:57.013
- Oh, you do?
- Oh, absolutely.

00:57.047 --> 00:59.749
So why don't you come
and bring it then, bitch?

00:59.784 --> 01:01.352
(all) Ooh.

01:01.386 --> 01:02.586
See, no.

01:02.621 --> 01:05.056
You are riding
my last nerve.

01:05.090 --> 01:06.692
And I ain't even playin'
no more.

01:06.726 --> 01:09.896
I am not even playin'
no more.

01:09.930 --> 01:10.898
Oh, it's on?

01:10.933 --> 01:12.067
Then let's do something,
okay?

01:12.101 --> 01:13.169
You wanna go?

01:13.203 --> 01:15.439
(all) Ooh.

01:15.474 --> 01:16.674
Uh-uh.

01:16.708 --> 01:18.342
Huh?
There we go.

Godfather II, God--

07:16.780 --> 07:18.848
Mm, on the third one, but...

07:18.882 --> 07:22.451
We are very tolerant,
considering that

07:22.486 --> 07:25.621

07:41.604 --> 07:43.672

after we walk off the stage.

07:51.446 --> 07:52.747

07:52.781 --> 07:55.383

You're being rude.
let's go.

08:21.177 --> 08:24.513
I'm not trying
to be rude, it's--

08:24.548 --> 08:25.648
The lights are off.

08:25.682 --> 08:28.517
Maybe we--
let's come back later. Y--

08:28.552 --> 08:30.453
Hey, she's probably
just takin' a nap

08:30.487 --> 08:32.822
after the huge meal
she just made for us.

08:32.856 --> 08:34.423
Go in.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.027
I don't have the key.

08:39.062 --> 08:40.294
You should go in first.

08:40.328 --> 08:42.464
Oh, <i>marrone</i>, she said
she'd leave it open.

08:42.498 --> 08:47.636
Vinny, stop being
such a <i>strunzo</i> and get in there.

08:52.676 --> 08:55.678
All right, all right.

08:57.000 --> 09:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here

10:22.702 --> 10:25.670
Surprise.

10:29.108 --> 10:30.709
No, I'm good, man.

10:30.743 --> 10:33.145
You hungry?

10:33.179 --> 10:35.180
Sure, I could eat.
Yeah, man.

10:35.215 --> 10:37.049
Um, what you want?

10:37.083 --> 10:38.917
Uh, pizza?
Chinese?

10:38.952 --> 10:40.386
(clicks tongue)

10:40.420 --> 10:42.513
Kill that noise, man.

10:44.390 --> 10:46.252
I got a <i>ratatouille</i>.

10:46.704 --> 10:48.510
(squealing noises)

10:48.962 --> 10:50.029
Oh, [bleep]!

10:50.063 --> 10:51.363
That's a rat, dude.

10:51.397 --> 10:52.531
No, it ain't.

10:52.565 --> 10:55.133
That's a <i>ratatouille</i>, yo.

10:55.986 --> 10:58.837
Hey, Ratatouille,
go make my man a sandwich.

10:58.872 --> 11:02.007
Yeah, show him what you got.

11:07.981 --> 11:09.482
What the [bleep], son?

11:09.516 --> 11:11.687
You got a rat up in your house?

11:13.220 --> 11:15.334
What this mean?

11:16.585 --> 11:18.591
I don't know what to say, man.

11:18.625 --> 11:20.292
I got a <i>ratatouille</i>, man.

11:20.327 --> 11:22.595
He a chef just like
in all them movies, man.

11:22.629 --> 11:23.829
No, no r--hey.

11:23.864 --> 11:25.565
There's only--
(sighs)

11:25.599 --> 11:28.134
There's only one movie, Levi,
all right?

11:28.169 --> 11:29.636
And he's not a <i>ratatouille</i>.

11:29.671 --> 11:32.506
He's a rat
and his name is Remy.

11:32.540 --> 11:34.908
- Potahto, potayto.
- Potahto, p--

11:34.942 --> 11:36.643
- I gots myself a <i>ratatouille</i>.

11:36.677 --> 11:39.112
That's all I know.

11:39.146 --> 11:41.080
Order up.

11:41.115 --> 11:43.066
Damn!
Oh, Levi!

11:47.973 --> 11:50.423
<i>VoilÃ .</i>

11:50.458 --> 11:52.325
Levi, look at this thing, man.

11:52.359 --> 11:54.794
You see it got
bite marks all over it.

11:54.829 --> 11:57.730
Any good chef
has to taste his creation.

11:57.764 --> 12:02.001
That's rat [bleep]
on the sandwich.

12:02.036 --> 12:04.171
He did make a sandwich though.

12:04.205 --> 12:05.372
Oh, hell no.

12:05.406 --> 12:06.540
I'm out.

12:06.574 --> 12:09.710
My dude, you need help.

12:09.744 --> 12:13.146
Hey.

12:13.181 --> 12:14.515
Oh, well, Ratatouille.

12:14.549 --> 12:16.917
Another negative review.

12:17.955 --> 12:20.020
Maybe you want it,
Charlotte's web.

12:24.812 --> 12:25.945
(soul music)

12:26.006 --> 12:28.107
Has anybody been racially
profiled here?

12:28.115 --> 12:29.949
(crowd shouting agreement)
Yes.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.451
- Really?
- Yes. Yes.

12:32.486 --> 12:34.020
That's why we have
the glasses on, right?

12:34.054 --> 12:35.021
No, I'm good.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.155
I'm one of the nerdy ones.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.257
Here, right here.

12:38.292 --> 12:39.692
Carry on, carry on.

12:39.726 --> 12:41.694
Being a black man
it is--it is scary, man.

12:41.728 --> 12:44.096
We can get thrown away
for just no reason.

12:44.131 --> 12:45.164
Yeah, yeah.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.565
Wh--I did what to who?

12:46.600 --> 12:48.935
Like, d--but seriously now,
what?

12:48.969 --> 12:50.670
What are the charges?

12:50.704 --> 12:51.704
What did they get you for?

12:51.738 --> 12:52.872
D--I don't know.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.674
They asked me
to come down to the station.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.075
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.142
- I was just--
- I came.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.677
- I'm a [bleep] idiot.
- I know.

12:58.711 --> 13:01.180
Yeah.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.148
Are you--is there
any Muslim-Americans in the--

13:03.182 --> 13:05.050
(crowd cheers)
There we go.

13:05.084 --> 13:06.051
All right.
We're very pleased--

13:06.085 --> 13:07.052
You guys
have it the worst

13:07.086 --> 13:08.053
- right now though, right?
- Yeah.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.121
They'll just look at your name

13:09.155 --> 13:10.389
and see it's
(speaks gibberish)

13:10.423 --> 13:12.791
All right.
[bleep] you go.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.035
Look Rajid,

13:23.069 --> 13:24.970
I'm gonna make this
really nice and easy for you.

13:25.004 --> 13:26.972
I need names and you're gonna
give 'em to me.

13:27.006 --> 13:28.173
You have to listen to me.

13:28.207 --> 13:30.342
You have to listen to me.

13:30.376 --> 13:33.244
This is all a huge mistake.

13:33.279 --> 13:35.580
Bull[bleep]!

13:36.882 --> 13:38.283
Department of Homeland
Security's

13:38.317 --> 13:41.052
been monitoring your calls
for weeks, Rajid.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.454
We got you.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.556
We know about you
and your friends.

13:44.590 --> 13:46.524
We know that you're a--

13:46.559 --> 13:47.525
Terrierist.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.728
I am a terrierist.

13:50.763 --> 13:53.598
We--me and my friends,
we breed dogs,

13:53.632 --> 13:55.300
specifically terriers.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.602
We write terrierist fiction.

13:57.636 --> 13:59.938
We spend a good deal of time

13:59.972 --> 14:02.775
discussing possible future
terrierist plots--

14:02.809 --> 14:03.971
(groans)

14:05.111 --> 14:06.978
Hmm.
That's a nice try.

14:06.997 --> 14:08.111
It really is.

14:08.742 --> 14:11.883
But it's bull[bleep], Rajid!

14:11.917 --> 14:13.017
Come on.

14:13.052 --> 14:14.352
Is that the best you got?

14:14.386 --> 14:16.253
Now come on, I'm listening.

14:16.288 --> 14:17.722
Just tell me.
Tell me.

14:17.756 --> 14:19.540
Tell me about
this imminent attack.

14:20.625 --> 14:22.760
What? What?
What attack?

14:22.794 --> 14:24.061
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:24.095 --> 14:25.495
What are you t--what am i
talking about?

14:25.530 --> 14:27.230
- I don't--
- I don't know, huh? huh?

14:27.265 --> 14:28.531
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:28.566 --> 14:29.933
- I'm telling you--
- No, you don't know?

14:29.967 --> 14:31.734
I don't know.
I don't know.

14:31.769 --> 14:34.070
June 11, Rajid.

14:34.104 --> 14:35.605
You spoke of an imminent attack.

14:35.639 --> 14:36.906
Oh, oh, yes. No.

14:36.941 --> 14:38.274
Listen, that was my friend.

14:38.309 --> 14:40.710
- Listen, his dog bit him.
- No.

14:40.744 --> 14:42.311
And I told him,
"If you do not train them..."

14:42.346 --> 14:44.781
- No.
- "another terrier attack

14:44.816 --> 14:45.782
"is imminent."

14:45.817 --> 14:49.153
(grunts)

14:49.187 --> 14:51.221
So you lie
and you see what happens?

14:51.256 --> 14:53.623
I don't--
I'm not lying to you.

14:53.657 --> 14:55.524
Come on, Rajid.
I like you.

14:55.559 --> 14:57.693
let's be friends, huh?

14:57.728 --> 14:59.561
Now you still
haven't explained to me

14:59.596 --> 15:03.298
why we found, on the search
engine of your computer,

15:03.333 --> 15:06.468
the words "Target Washington"
49 times.

15:06.502 --> 15:09.771
That--that is because
I was in D.C. for a dog show

15:09.806 --> 15:12.041
and I had to buy a squeezy toy,
a birthday card,

15:12.075 --> 15:14.510
and some deodorant
all at an affordable price.

15:14.545 --> 15:16.312
All right.

15:16.346 --> 15:17.446
You can only
do that at Target.

15:17.481 --> 15:18.447
Yeah, okay.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.149
I see how you wanna play this.

15:20.183 --> 15:21.783
(groans)

15:21.817 --> 15:25.453
This is not a case
of mistaken identity, Rajid,

15:25.488 --> 15:27.655
and you know it!

15:27.690 --> 15:30.391
We've heard the conversations
between you and Jafar.

15:30.426 --> 15:33.395
Where you discussing your hatred
of American ideals.

15:33.429 --> 15:34.396
No, no, Idols.

15:34.430 --> 15:35.798
American Idols!

15:35.832 --> 15:37.132
I-I hate them.

15:37.167 --> 15:38.467
They performed "Dancing Queen".

15:38.501 --> 15:41.570
It was a desecration to ABBA.

15:41.604 --> 15:43.839
My favorite band.

15:43.874 --> 15:46.209
We got you on tape
referring to Jafar

15:46.243 --> 15:47.911
as one of the architects of--

15:47.945 --> 15:49.346
- 7-Eleven!

15:49.380 --> 15:52.015
it was 7-Eleven!

15:52.049 --> 15:56.686
Jafar--he designs
convenience stores.

15:58.189 --> 16:00.924
7-Eleven?

16:00.958 --> 16:02.659
Oh, [bleep].

16:02.693 --> 16:06.329
Wilson, 65 dogs just attacked
the Capitol building.

16:07.234 --> 16:08.297
Were they terriers?

16:08.332 --> 16:09.865
How did you know?

16:09.900 --> 16:11.067
[bleep]!

16:11.101 --> 16:13.470
Praise ABBA.

16:18.710 --> 16:20.611
Welcome to Metta World News.

16:20.645 --> 16:23.381
In sports,
I'd rather eat my hand

16:23.415 --> 16:25.283
than to have my penis cut off.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.885
I'd really have to believe
someone was gonna cut it off,

16:27.920 --> 16:31.155
but if I did,
I could definitely eat my hand.

16:31.190 --> 16:33.658
I know because
I had a dream where I did it.

16:33.692 --> 16:34.725
It was horrible.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.194
I ate my whole hand.

16:36.228 --> 16:38.897
Now that's what you call
"rhetoric."

16:38.932 --> 16:40.699
Well, that wraps up
Metta World News

16:40.734 --> 16:43.402
for this Wednesday,
April Hurricane Slipknot.

16:43.436 --> 16:44.703
I'm Metta World Peace.

16:44.738 --> 16:45.916
Good night.

16:53.562 --> 16:54.729
We go to the movies
together sometimes.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.998
- Yes.
- And we very often

16:56.999 --> 16:59.867
find ourselves
in these really annoying spots

16:59.935 --> 17:01.502
where the guys in front of us
are talking about a movie--

17:01.537 --> 17:03.237
they can't remember a movie.

17:03.271 --> 17:06.205
I've seen people get caught
in a crazy, like, vortex.

17:06.241 --> 17:07.708
Talking about--
hey, hey, man.

17:07.742 --> 17:09.342
You know,
what's the girl's name?

17:09.377 --> 17:10.410
What's the girl's name?

17:10.444 --> 17:11.944
- You know--
- She does this?

17:11.980 --> 17:13.946
- She does this?
- She don't do this.

17:13.982 --> 17:16.316
No, she, um--she on a boat.

17:16.351 --> 17:17.351
and then the dude
is on the boat.

17:17.385 --> 17:18.352
She's doing it--she doing it.

17:18.386 --> 17:20.253
She got--"I will
always--in love--"

17:20.289 --> 17:22.022
- She's says "I will--"
- "I'm on the boat."

17:22.058 --> 17:23.290
Oh, Whitney Houston,
Whitney Houston,

17:23.326 --> 17:25.694
Whitney Houston,
Whitney Houston.

17:25.728 --> 17:27.494
- She's blonde.
- Oh, and--oh, she blonde.

17:27.529 --> 17:28.762
She on the boat,

17:28.797 --> 17:30.564
and then the shark--
<i>Jaws</i>, man. <i>Jaws</i>.

17:30.598 --> 17:32.799
- Talking about Jaws.
- No.

17:32.834 --> 17:35.535
The boat sinks,
it crashes and sinks.

17:35.570 --> 17:37.104
- What can hit it?
- It sinks.

17:37.138 --> 17:39.006
It hits a big-ass ice cube,
and it sinks.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.342
Oh! Oh! Oh!

17:41.376 --> 17:42.443
<i>Friday</i>.

17:47.749 --> 17:49.850
- Damn, she was fly.
- She a'ight.

17:49.884 --> 17:51.685
Yo, man.
Can I ask you a question?

17:51.719 --> 17:53.086
Yeah. What?

17:53.121 --> 17:54.922
Why everybody messing
with the Batmans?

17:54.956 --> 17:56.289
(clicks tongue) See?

17:56.324 --> 17:59.226
That's exactly
what I've been asking myself.

17:59.260 --> 18:00.293
It don't make no sense.

18:00.328 --> 18:01.428
Why would you do it?

18:01.462 --> 18:02.896
Why would you do that?

18:02.930 --> 18:05.398
Why would you try and mess
with the Batman?

18:05.432 --> 18:07.400
- It's futile.
- It is.

18:07.434 --> 18:08.902
Yo, remember,
Heath Ledger tried to.

18:08.936 --> 18:10.403
Psh, I mean,
the Batman's got armor.

18:10.438 --> 18:11.738
And, you know,
some martial arts

18:11.772 --> 18:14.007
and moves--
(indistinct)

18:14.041 --> 18:15.275
(imitates sound
of bullets deflecting)

18:15.309 --> 18:16.409
It don't work.
I got armor.

18:16.444 --> 18:17.944
- And then martial arts.
- Come on.

18:17.978 --> 18:19.846
- All you got is a purple suit
and some pancake makeup.

18:19.880 --> 18:20.913
Come on, man.

18:20.948 --> 18:22.148
I mean, come on, man.
Batman.

18:22.182 --> 18:24.850
- Why would you...
 - (both) mess with the Batman?

18:24.884 --> 18:26.785
- That's what I'm saying, man.

18:26.820 --> 18:28.153
Oh, remember
when Danny DeVito tried it?

18:28.188 --> 18:29.755
- Psh.
- Start walking around.

18:29.789 --> 18:30.789
Talking like...

18:30.824 --> 18:33.826
(both squawking)

18:37.097 --> 18:38.864

with the Batman.

19:51.274 --> 19:52.340
What is it supposed to be
doing to the Batman?

19:52.374 --> 19:54.075
- Giving the Batmans a cold?
- Come on, man.

19:54.109 --> 19:55.443
