WEBVTT

00:59.267 --> 01:00.977
How many eggs did you get?

01:01.061 --> 01:04.439
Six.
Daddy said he wanted two just for him.

01:04.522 --> 01:07.609
- Calm down. I'm just having salad tonight.
- Oh, right!

01:23.917 --> 01:27.379


01:33.968 --> 01:36.304


01:36.388 --> 01:37.430


01:48.441 --> 01:50.568


02:51.463 --> 02:53.506
FEDERAL POLICE

02:54.090 --> 02:56.593
Good morning.
You can't come in here, sir!

02:56.676 --> 02:58.720
What the fuck is this? What happened?

03:02.349 --> 03:04.851
SEARCH AND SEIZURE WARRANT

03:11.691 --> 03:13.026
Five minutes with him.

03:14.694 --> 03:15.862
What's going on?

03:15.945 --> 03:18.114
I've come to get Paula out of here,

03:18.198 --> 03:21.701
and I'm going to turn this clinic
upside down until I find Lúcia.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.912
Show's over, Doctor.

03:25.789 --> 03:26.915
Lúcia…

03:28.166 --> 03:29.376
Paula…

03:31.336 --> 03:33.797
Does the name Norman Foster
mean anything to you?

03:35.256 --> 03:36.716
Albert Speer?

03:38.259 --> 03:39.469
Guglielmo?

03:41.513 --> 03:43.890
History's great architects,

03:44.849 --> 03:48.895
and yet nevertheless,
people only remember their works.

03:49.688 --> 03:51.856
Uh-huh. Fuck off.

03:53.566 --> 03:54.567
Let's go.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.737
Honestly, Marques,

03:59.614 --> 04:01.616
I don't really care about my own life.

04:03.284 --> 04:05.578
There's something underway here

04:06.663 --> 04:09.499
that's much bigger than any existence.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.293
Yeah.

04:12.377 --> 04:16.089
For you, things are still about Paula

04:16.756 --> 04:18.133
or Lúcia…

04:20.135 --> 04:21.511
or your daughter.

04:27.475 --> 04:31.980
You're nothing but an asshole and
a monster, Schultz. That's what you are.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.899
That's exactly where you're wrong.

04:36.651 --> 04:39.863
I'm the one who saves people
like your daughter.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.950
I'm the one who's going to find
the cure for cancer,

04:44.617 --> 04:46.036
for depression,

04:46.536 --> 04:48.788
for every single autoimmune disease!

04:51.958 --> 04:53.585
My research

04:54.961 --> 04:57.213
will stop trauma like yours

04:58.465 --> 05:01.343
from producing people as miserable as you.

05:04.929 --> 05:07.849
There's so much more to life, Marques.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.643
Look to the future.

05:12.187 --> 05:17.067
You are part of a system that's
much greater than your friend Paula

05:18.276 --> 05:20.111
or her little daughter.

05:22.947 --> 05:26.409
We're making history, Marques.
Don't you see?

05:29.412 --> 05:30.830
Your problem, Doctor,

05:32.332 --> 05:34.834
is that traumatized people like me

05:35.877 --> 05:37.754
are only good for one thing.

05:42.634 --> 05:45.679
And that's fucking up people like you.

05:49.140 --> 05:52.560
We're done here.

05:53.978 --> 05:55.230
He's coming with us.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.378
The senator's asked you
to solve this problem, Doctor.

06:35.729 --> 06:39.691
Hey, hey! Whoa. Yo,
you can't be here, man.

06:39.774 --> 06:43.194
- Come on. My bike died on the highway.
- I don't care. Not interested.

06:43.278 --> 06:45.113
- Turn around.
- I can't get it to start.

07:08.178 --> 07:11.514
Drink this water, Marques.
It'll be good for you.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.894
<i>Your call</i>
<i>is being forwarded to voice mail,</i>

07:15.977 --> 07:18.104
<i>and you will be charged after the tone.</i>

07:35.830 --> 07:36.956
Drink.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.726
Well, what's the plan?

08:00.605 --> 08:01.606
Are you serious?

08:12.033 --> 08:14.744
Don't move. Don't move.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.122
I've already told you not to move.

08:17.872 --> 08:20.166
- Son of a bitch…

09:13.636 --> 09:15.388
<i>He's gonna die.</i>

09:17.640 --> 09:19.142
<i>And it's all our fault.</i>

09:20.518 --> 09:21.561
Marques.

09:22.062 --> 09:26.066
Marques! Marques!
Marques! Marques! Marques.

09:26.149 --> 09:28.401
Marques. Marques, it's me. It's me, Paula.

09:28.485 --> 09:32.113
Marques, get out of here.
What are you doing here? Get out of here!

09:32.197 --> 09:33.865
If I could kill him…

09:33.948 --> 09:35.950
Kill who? Kill who? Schultz?

09:36.034 --> 09:37.911
I think-- I think I have to kill him.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.789
Marques.
Marques, he-- he's going to kill you!

09:40.872 --> 09:43.458
He's going to kill you!
I dreamt that-- Get out of here!

09:43.541 --> 09:46.294
For God's sake, get out of here!
You have to get out of here!

09:46.378 --> 09:50.048
- Get out of here! Get out of here!
- Kill him.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.967
For the love of God, get out of here.
Go! Leave!

09:53.051 --> 09:55.136
Marques, get out of here! Marques--

09:55.220 --> 09:57.681
Paula! Let him go. It's not him anymore.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.141
- Let me go!
- Trust me, Paula.

10:00.225 --> 10:02.185
- Get out!
- Let him go.

10:02.268 --> 10:05.480
- Marques! Marques!
- Not you, cutie!

10:05.563 --> 10:07.232
- Let me go!
- This isn't over.

10:07.315 --> 10:10.110
- Let me go!
- Be quiet, whore! You scratched me!

10:10.193 --> 10:13.196
- Marques! Marques, get out of here!

10:13.279 --> 10:16.449
Marques! Get out of here, Marques! Go!

10:16.533 --> 10:18.993
Let me go! Let me go!

10:19.077 --> 10:21.746
Let me go! Let go!

10:24.874 --> 10:28.003
- Son of a bitch!
- Close the door and get the hose.

10:28.086 --> 10:31.715
This chick is way too jumpy.
She needs to take a shower to calm down.

10:35.927 --> 10:38.847
Slut. You like scratching, do you?

10:44.561 --> 10:49.983
- You're gonna smell real nice.
- Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

10:50.066 --> 10:52.360
- You piece of shit!

11:28.229 --> 11:30.106
What the fuck is this?

11:30.190 --> 11:32.150
Well, look who it is.

11:34.110 --> 11:37.238
Listen, if you disappear right now,

11:37.322 --> 11:39.699
I'll cut you some slack
and pretend I didn't see you.

11:40.283 --> 11:43.703
- I have no problem disappearing…

11:43.787 --> 11:45.580
…as long as she disappears with me.

11:45.663 --> 11:49.584
- Go on. Wreck that guy.

11:49.668 --> 11:52.212
You've been asking for a beating
for a while.

11:56.132 --> 11:59.469
Son of a bitch!

12:39.926 --> 12:42.178
- Where? Where? Where?
- Hurry.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.473
- Shh!
- Straight ahead. Run. Go!

12:52.522 --> 12:53.565
Here!

14:42.924 --> 14:44.843
Go! Come on! Come on! Come on!

14:44.926 --> 14:46.928
Go, go! Take one! Take one!

14:47.512 --> 14:49.848
Let's go! Come on! Come on! Come on!

15:00.692 --> 15:03.028
- Come on! Fuck!

15:06.364 --> 15:08.825
- Holy shit.

15:20.837 --> 15:23.089
Let's go. Come on.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.664
Paula! Let's go!

15:56.748 --> 15:58.166
You need to run.

15:59.584 --> 16:00.627
I can't.

16:00.710 --> 16:03.672
Look, if they catch us,
they'll put us in the machine.

16:03.755 --> 16:06.549
Come on. I can try to help you.
Come. I can carry you.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.760
No, no. No, it's not that I'm tired.

16:09.386 --> 16:10.553
I can't go.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.223
You don't have a choice.

16:14.557 --> 16:18.395
I can't leave my daughter behind.
I can't escape without Lúcia.

16:19.854 --> 16:22.315
I can take you where your daughter is
if you want.

16:24.776 --> 16:27.070
But it's only going to bring you
more pain.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.034
Wait. Say that again.

16:35.370 --> 16:37.330
You've always known where she is?

16:39.874 --> 16:42.711
Everything you've been through up to now
has been an act.

16:43.795 --> 16:46.631
It was all designed by Schultz
to manipulate you,

16:46.715 --> 16:48.842
to turn your mind into what he needs.

16:48.925 --> 16:52.262
- That's it. That's what he does.
- And you're helping him!

16:58.268 --> 17:01.646
Take me to her! Take me to her now!

17:13.074 --> 17:16.703
Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch.

17:18.621 --> 17:22.500
I want to kill that son of a bitch.

18:44.416 --> 18:46.626
All you've done is lie to me.

18:47.502 --> 18:49.838
You lying son of a bitch!

18:50.588 --> 18:52.424
I just want to help you, Paula.

18:53.008 --> 18:55.593
I don't believe a word
of what you're saying.

18:55.677 --> 18:59.305
I know. I know.

19:00.765 --> 19:03.476
Did Schultz tell you
to take me to Lúcia too?

19:03.560 --> 19:05.311
No. No.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.190
He'll kill me when he finds out.

19:09.941 --> 19:14.112
What I'm about to show you
is something no mother should see.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.491
Go. Go!

19:23.997 --> 19:28.918

<i>Jerônimo! Patient 164320.</i>

19:31.463 --> 19:35.717
<i>We trusted you,</i>
<i>but you gave us nothing in return.</i>

19:38.511 --> 19:43.099
<i>You weren't as useful as</i>
<i>your mother and brother were.</i>

19:44.893 --> 19:47.354
<i>You should be more grateful.</i>

19:49.689 --> 19:53.276
<i>But you're useless even for that.</i>

20:26.059 --> 20:27.060
Is that it?

20:27.143 --> 20:28.645
- Yeah.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.230
Hold on, hold on.

20:30.313 --> 20:33.316
What is it?
She's being held in there, is that it?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.193
- Is there some kind of cell?
- No cell.

20:35.276 --> 20:38.530
No. I know very well
what I saw inside that chapel.

20:38.613 --> 20:41.783
What you saw was true,
and what you're about to see is also true.

20:42.909 --> 20:46.996
I just need you to understand something:
Lúcia's not the same anymore.

20:48.665 --> 20:50.083
Fuck off.

20:52.544 --> 20:53.586
Paula.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.591
- Paula. Paula!

21:06.808 --> 21:10.645
Honey. Lúcia! Lúcia!

21:10.729 --> 21:14.315
Paula! Paula! Paula, hold on!

21:29.122 --> 21:30.248
Jerônimo.

21:39.674 --> 21:40.800
Jerônimo.

21:50.852 --> 21:53.271
Jerônimo? Jerônimo, are you there?

21:53.355 --> 21:55.690
- Jerônimo, can you hear me?

21:56.858 --> 21:58.443
Jerônimo!

22:04.491 --> 22:07.660
- Honey! It's me, your mom, my love.
- Mom?

22:08.244 --> 22:10.789
I'm your mom, honey.
It's me, Paula. Honey, I'm your mom!

22:10.872 --> 22:13.541
- Remember? I'm your mom.
- What is it? What's going on?

22:13.625 --> 22:15.168
- Mom.
- What do you want?

22:15.251 --> 22:16.336
Paula, don't do this.

22:16.419 --> 22:19.589
Lady, I think you're confused.
This is my daughter, Martina.

22:21.508 --> 22:24.010
Relax, honey.
They escaped from the clinic.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.846
I'm going to get your dad. Otávio!

22:26.930 --> 22:28.682
- Honey.
- Paula.

22:28.765 --> 22:31.184
- Otávio! Come here, Otávio!
- Lúlú.

22:31.810 --> 22:33.770
Your name is Lúcia Costa Mello.

22:33.853 --> 22:37.941
You're 19.
You moved upstate to study to be a vet.

22:38.525 --> 22:41.486
Do you remember? Do you remember
when you cut off all your hair?

22:41.569 --> 22:42.696
- Mom.

22:42.779 --> 22:45.407
You came to my room
with locks of hair in your hand, crying.

22:45.490 --> 22:46.991
- Mom.
- Get your hands off my daughter!

22:47.075 --> 22:48.618
- Shut up!
- Mom.

22:48.702 --> 22:49.953
Otávio!

22:50.036 --> 22:53.248
- Everything's okay.
- Lady, my name is Martina.

22:53.331 --> 22:55.709
You've got me mixed up
with someone else, okay?

22:55.792 --> 22:56.876
- Stay calm.
- No, honey--

22:56.960 --> 23:00.213
What's going on here?
Get out of my house, both of you.

23:00.296 --> 23:03.508
Calm down, honey. The hospital staff
are already on their way.

23:03.591 --> 23:06.553
You-- You…

23:07.137 --> 23:08.638
You're all with Schultz!

23:08.722 --> 23:11.766
You're setting this up,
but she is my daughter!

23:11.850 --> 23:12.934
No, Paula.

23:13.768 --> 23:14.769
Your arm!

23:15.687 --> 23:20.150
Do you remember how you lost that arm?
You had a tattoo on that arm.

23:20.233 --> 23:23.528
You asked me to let you get the tattoo.
I didn't let you, but you got it anyway.

23:23.611 --> 23:25.530
- Then we fought. You had--
- Enough!

23:27.323 --> 23:29.242
Get out, both of you, or I'll shoot!

23:29.325 --> 23:30.827
- I'm coming back for you.
- Paula.

23:30.910 --> 23:34.289
- I'm coming back to save you. You hear me?
- We have to leave now. Please.

23:34.372 --> 23:35.999
- You're my daughter.
- Get out!

23:36.082 --> 23:37.459
Everything's going to be okay!

23:38.960 --> 23:40.712
- Honey, everything's okay.
- What was that?

23:44.299 --> 23:48.386
- They went that way!

23:48.470 --> 23:50.722
- We need to run! Quick!
- Go, go!

24:41.648 --> 24:42.899
WELCOME TO WHITE MIST

24:43.900 --> 24:45.026
- Shit, Marques!

24:45.110 --> 24:47.445
<i>Your call is being forwarded</i>
<i>to voice mail,</i>

24:47.529 --> 24:50.156
- <i>and you will be charged after the tone.</i>
- Pick up!

24:53.410 --> 24:54.411
Fuck!

25:13.555 --> 25:16.016
<i>Your call is being forwarded</i>
<i>to voice mail,</i>

25:16.099 --> 25:18.977
- <i>and you will be charged after the tone.</i>

25:26.234 --> 25:28.153
Answer me, Jerônimo! Open this door!

25:29.571 --> 25:30.739
Jerônimo!

25:49.299 --> 25:52.635
Hands on your head, scum!
Go, go, go! Hands up!

26:27.337 --> 26:29.422
- ID, please.

26:29.506 --> 26:32.050
- It's a police car. Can I let them in?
- <i>Negative.</i>

26:32.133 --> 26:34.344
- Not now, okay?
- Why can't I go in?

26:35.220 --> 26:38.223
- Wait a moment, please.
- What's going on? I need to go in.

26:38.306 --> 26:41.017
- Just a minute, ma'am.
- No. I need to get in there now.

27:01.246 --> 27:04.082
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Come on! Come on!

27:32.235 --> 27:33.445
You can go ahead.

28:12.150 --> 28:15.612
What did they do to Lúcia?

28:15.695 --> 28:18.365
How did they do that to my daughter? How?

28:18.448 --> 28:21.201
She's in her world. She's okay.

28:21.284 --> 28:23.370
How can she be okay?

28:23.453 --> 28:25.038
You have to believe me.

28:26.289 --> 28:28.333
You have to believe in us.

28:28.416 --> 28:31.044
- We can be okay too.
- Go!

28:31.127 --> 28:33.213
- They're over there!

28:33.296 --> 28:35.674
Surround them, surround them!

28:35.757 --> 28:37.842
- Come with me, Paula.

28:37.926 --> 28:40.553
Come with me. We'll be okay in my world.

28:41.388 --> 28:45.016
Trust me.
The only way out is to my perfect world.

28:50.939 --> 28:52.357
Let me take you.

28:53.441 --> 28:55.568
Come on.

29:05.787 --> 29:09.582
Don't jump! Everything's okay.

29:10.458 --> 29:11.584
Paula! Hang on!

29:13.003 --> 29:15.338
- Let's go back to the clinic!

29:16.715 --> 29:18.508
Stay still! Sit down!
