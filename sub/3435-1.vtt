00:45.211 --> 00:47.589
<i>Historically,
when we look at evolution...</i>

00:47.756 --> 00:50.759
<i>...it's not surprising
that Chappie's left turn happened.</i>

00:52.802 --> 00:57.390
<i>It's too early to tell how
this is all going to play out.</i>

00:57.557 --> 00:59.957
<i>I didn't believe this would happen
in my lifetime, but it is.</i>

01:05.522 --> 01:07.025
<i>Downtown Johannesburg.</i>

01:07.192 --> 01:08.526
<i>It's a dangerous city.</i>

01:08.693 --> 01:13.406
<i>Each day, more than 300 murders
and violent attacks take place here.</i>

01:16.534 --> 01:19.704
<i>Two officers have been killed,
three taken to the hospital.</i>

01:19.871 --> 01:23.166
<i>A bloody end to a shoot-out
between cops and robbers.</i>

01:23.333 --> 01:25.627
<i>Another man in blue dead.</i>

01:27.754 --> 01:31.883
Today, we usher in a new day.

01:32.050 --> 01:36.596
<i>- One that represents the end of crime.
- Move in. Lock on target. Fire! Fire!</i>

01:37.138 --> 01:39.099
The end of corruption.

01:39.849 --> 01:42.143
<i>Go! Go! Up against the wall!</i>

01:42.310 --> 01:43.853
<i>On the ground.</i>

01:44.020 --> 01:46.648
<i>- All targets neutralized.
- And the start...</i>

01:46.815 --> 01:49.609
...of the rebirth of our city!

01:51.528 --> 01:55.365
<i>Welcome to the world's
first robotic police force.</i>

02:07.460 --> 02:11.631
<i>Johannesburg, South Africa, became
the focus of the world in 2016...</i>

02:11.798 --> 02:15.468
<i>...with the deployment of the planet's
first all-robotic police units.</i>

02:16.803 --> 02:20.974
<i>Crime levels plummeted,
and Tetravaal stock skyrocketed.</i>

02:22.308 --> 02:26.354
<i>Certain parts are from China, but all robots
are assembled right here in South Africa.</i>

02:26.521 --> 02:30.483
<i>The population's biggest fear
was vulnerability to hacking.</i>

02:30.650 --> 02:33.653
<i>Tetravaal assures this is not
something to worry about...</i>

02:33.820 --> 02:36.072
<i>...with their bulletproof
Guard Key system.</i>

02:36.239 --> 02:40.535
<i>A system which allows only them
to update software on the robots.</i>

02:41.244 --> 02:44.748
<i>Before the success of the ubiquitous
human-sized police robots...</i>

02:44.914 --> 02:48.001
<i>...there was a bigger bad boy
on the block: the Moose.</i>

02:48.168 --> 02:51.713
<i>Vincent Moore is a weapons designer
and a former soldier.</i>

02:51.880 --> 02:55.175
<i>He has a spiritual issue
with artificial intelligence.</i>

02:55.342 --> 02:57.135
<i>I have a robot that is indestructible.</i>

02:58.553 --> 03:01.639
<i>It is operated
by a thinking, adaptable...</i>

03:01.806 --> 03:04.726
<i>...humane, moral human being.</i>

03:04.893 --> 03:07.354
<i>The advanced neural transmitter
converts...</i>

03:07.520 --> 03:10.648
<i>...the human operator's thoughts
into the robot's actions.</i>

03:10.815 --> 03:14.110
<i>A departure from the AI
that governs the Scouts.</i>

03:14.277 --> 03:17.364
<i>Now with interest from the U.S.,
China and North Korea...</i>

03:17.530 --> 03:20.742
<i>...the Scouts' creator, Deon Wilson,
sees a rich future.</i>

03:20.909 --> 03:22.952
<i>What really interests me
is high-level AI.</i>

03:24.329 --> 03:28.208
<i>True intelligence.
A machine that can think and feel.</i>

03:28.375 --> 03:30.627
<i>Is that the mandate at Tetravaal?</i>

03:30.794 --> 03:35.674
<i>To take that evolutionary step forward
and build something truly alive?</i>

03:41.554 --> 03:44.182
<i>Scout 22 arriving now
at Maintenance Bay 6.</i>

03:44.349 --> 03:46.601
- Team 1, off deck. Go!
- Hurry. Open it up.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.978
- Let's get him out.
- Load it up!

03:49.145 --> 03:50.980
- He's pretty banged up.
- Oh, my God.

03:51.147 --> 03:53.024
- Come on!
- Ready to go.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.074
Oh, chrissakes.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.868
See this 22? Luck of the draw.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.704
They used him as a speed bump.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.790
Look at this.
It's like he's cursed or something.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.835
Every time he goes out.
Now, yeah, it's his ear.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.087
Antenna, right.
Can we switch this out?

04:14.254 --> 04:15.630
Check that circuit again.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.800
Terminal on 7 and 7A.

04:23.972 --> 04:27.600
<i>Reports of gunfire
in Sections 5, 7 and 8.</i>

04:27.767 --> 04:28.768
Okay, fire it up.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.980
<i>Police request all available Scouts
to be mobilized.</i>

04:40.155 --> 04:42.073
Destination or task.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.950
Helipad. Yeah?

04:47.829 --> 04:50.582
Hey, 22, just watch yourself
this time, eh?

04:50.749 --> 04:52.375
Affirmative.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.638
- We're in shit!
- Duh, we in shit, Amerika!

05:05.805 --> 05:07.140
I said it was a bad deal.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.851
- I said it over and over.
- Everybody, just chill!

05:10.018 --> 05:12.937
Yes, we have a problem.
And, yes, I'm gonna solve it!

05:13.730 --> 05:16.983
<i>Command, we are searching
for suspects driving a gray vehicle.</i>

05:21.863 --> 05:23.907
Hey. They're here!

05:33.958 --> 05:36.211
- What's up with this shit?
- Looks pissed.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.257
Hippo.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.219
Listen, some shit went down.

05:44.386 --> 05:45.553
Wasn't our fault.

05:46.429 --> 05:47.430
Your weapon.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.724
Fuck's sakes.

05:49.891 --> 05:50.892
And your keys.

05:52.268 --> 05:53.269
Come on.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.646
Open the back.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.776
Hey, hey, hey!

06:05.699 --> 06:07.992
We're lucky to be alive, Hippo.

06:09.619 --> 06:10.620
Ninja.

06:11.996 --> 06:14.541
You know there's no way out of this.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.711
There's always a way.
Name your price. We'll sort you out.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.671
My price?

06:20.088 --> 06:21.172
Is 20 million.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.967
- Come on, man. Ridiculous.
- What the fuck?

06:24.134 --> 06:25.677
Fuck I'm gonna pay that back, dude?

06:25.844 --> 06:27.262
Get on your knees.

06:27.429 --> 06:30.765
- Now, get on your fucking knees!
- Okay, okay, okay.

06:32.308 --> 06:34.060
You owe me...

06:34.602 --> 06:36.563
...20 million. Say it.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.231
I owe you 20 million.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.904
- Pitbull. Pitbull!
- Get back!

06:45.071 --> 06:47.032
- Get back!
- Jesus Christ, Hippo.

06:47.198 --> 06:48.783
Seven days.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.702
You've got seven days.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.580
Droids! Droids!

06:54.122 --> 06:55.540
You were followed!

06:57.459 --> 07:00.086
- Get behind the wall!
- Yo-Landi, get in the van.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.254
- Let's go!
- Get in!

07:01.421 --> 07:03.089
Hit the explosives!

07:05.759 --> 07:08.845
- They detonated some explosive.
- Shit! Droids!

07:09.012 --> 07:10.972
Can't get a clear shot.
Touching down.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.724
Moving out.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.358
- Who took the keys?
- You gave it to that guy!

07:21.524 --> 07:23.568
Human officers are on the ground.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.236
Let's go! Let's move!

07:31.743 --> 07:33.203
Move out!

07:35.330 --> 07:37.999
Move out, 22. Go, go, go!

07:38.166 --> 07:41.252
Drop your weapons.
You are under arrest.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.466
Break right! Go, go, go!

07:48.259 --> 07:50.970
Come on. Where are the keys?

07:51.137 --> 07:52.222
Cue, on my left!

07:52.389 --> 07:55.308
- Kill these cops!
- Move! Get back!

08:01.147 --> 08:02.816
Yes, yes.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.109
Drop your weapons.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.070
Go!

08:08.655 --> 08:11.116
Hey, <i>poes!</i> I need my keys, please!

08:12.075 --> 08:13.410
Fuck you!

08:15.495 --> 08:18.331
- Drop your weapon. Drop your weapon!
- Fuck you!

08:25.880 --> 08:27.132
Come on.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.010
For sure, <i>baas</i>.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.691
Shit! They hit the rotor.
We need to touch down.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.696
Thank you very much.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.532
Twenty-two, going in.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.138
Droid 22 is down, sir.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.099
Bravo 1! We need backup!

09:18.266 --> 09:20.435
<i>Copy that. We're sending droids.</i>

09:21.478 --> 09:24.397
- Amerika! Amerika! I've got the keys!
- Your keys.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.941
- Hey, Landi, he's got the keys!
- Let's go!

09:30.737 --> 09:33.198
Get out of the vehicle.

09:33.365 --> 09:34.491
Go!

09:37.327 --> 09:39.245
Do not run.

09:43.041 --> 09:46.002
- Are you okay?
- I'm not okay! I'm hit!

09:52.008 --> 09:54.552
<i>Scout 22 is non-responsive.</i>

09:54.719 --> 09:56.179
<i>Send an evac team.</i>

09:56.846 --> 09:59.432
<i>Yet another victory
for the robotic police force.</i>

09:59.599 --> 10:03.311
<i>This marks the 30th large-scale
crime ring smashed this year.</i>

10:03.812 --> 10:05.689
- Good morning, Deon.
- Good morning.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.566
People...

10:08.733 --> 10:11.069
...if I may have your attention, please.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.363
<i>The police chief just called me...</i>

10:13.530 --> 10:16.950
<i>...to place an order
for another 100 Scouts.</i>

10:17.117 --> 10:19.202
This is very, very good news.

10:20.245 --> 10:21.287
Way to go!

10:21.454 --> 10:23.456
- Deon.
- Nice job!

10:23.623 --> 10:25.083
Well done, dude. Well done.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.751
- Congrats, D.
- Thank you, man.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.586
- Well done, Deon.
- Great.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.922
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Thank you.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.882
- I appreciate it.
- Nice job, buddy.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.552
- I couldn't have done it without you.
- I know.

10:36.511 --> 10:39.472
- Congrats, man. You're awesome.
- Nice job, mate!

10:44.811 --> 10:47.188
Is this the "I feel sorry
for Vincent" call?

10:47.355 --> 10:49.482
- Don't worry, Vince.
<i>- Well, I am worried.</i>

10:49.649 --> 10:50.692
Well, look...

10:50.859 --> 10:52.986
<i>...we have one more stab
with the police.</i>

10:53.153 --> 10:54.904
<i>Try to get those costs down.</i>

10:55.071 --> 10:57.157
Try to think positive, okay?

10:57.323 --> 10:58.950
- Chin up.
- <i>Kind of hard...</i>

10:59.117 --> 11:03.329
...when you keep cutting my funding.
Twenty percent this year, 25 last year.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.540
I've got work to do on the Moose.

11:05.707 --> 11:08.460
The threat detection is still
in its elemental phase.

11:08.626 --> 11:12.547
<i>Threat detection is superfluous.
The operator detects the threat.</i>

11:12.714 --> 11:14.341
<i>Then we send the Moose out.</i>

11:14.507 --> 11:16.301
Enough already.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.262
Cut. Not add.

11:19.429 --> 11:22.223
<i>- Okay?</i>
- Yeah. I'm on it.

11:22.724 --> 11:26.644
<i>- Deon Wilson to the workshop.</i>
- I need to go. I'll talk to you in a bit.

11:34.986 --> 11:36.821
It's my little boy in again, eh?

11:36.988 --> 11:40.241
Fucking surprise, surprise.
Every time. He's a bullet magnet.

11:40.408 --> 11:43.870
- What's going on, guys?
- Here's the report. It's 22. Again.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.789
RPG, direct to the chest.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.333
See a lot of the internals got damaged.

11:48.917 --> 11:52.545
- Brain architecture's still intact.
- Regardless, it's a write-off.

11:52.712 --> 11:56.216
- Okay, let's salvage the CPU.
- We could try to cut the battery out.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.719
- It's still charged, still stable.
- No, not worth the effort.

11:59.886 --> 12:03.598
Droid 22 written off. Crush the chassis
and recycle the alloys. Yeah?

12:03.765 --> 12:05.266
- Sure.
- Thank you.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.901
Easy, easy, easy.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.278
Come, come, come. Into the lair.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.823
- Careful, man.
- We need to stitch his shit up.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.293
You think you got away?

12:32.460 --> 12:34.337
No, I didn't think that, Hippo.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.589
You think you don't owe me
this money anymore?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.633
<i>Because you think
I'm in prison or what?</i>

12:38.800 --> 12:39.968
We'll get your money.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.512
Maybe I come to your secret place
in Soweto.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.306
<i>I come there with the fellows.</i>

12:45.473 --> 12:46.933
I take what I want.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.643
It's cool. One week.

12:48.810 --> 12:50.228
Seven days!

12:54.149 --> 12:56.192
- They didn't catch that <i>poes</i>.
- What?

12:56.359 --> 12:57.819
He knows where we live.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.071
We got a week to come up
with his money.

13:00.238 --> 13:03.033
How are we gonna do that?
Come on, that's ridiculous.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.702
We need one final job.

13:05.869 --> 13:09.581
I'm talking about serious cash.

13:09.748 --> 13:11.833
Five hundred million rand. Okay?

13:12.542 --> 13:15.211
We pay that animal.
We pocket the rest.

13:15.378 --> 13:18.381
And we get out
while we still can. Boom.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.717
What are you getting on about,
a bank job?

13:20.884 --> 13:22.052
No.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.012
- Cash in transit.
- What?

13:24.179 --> 13:26.056
- That's what?
- A heist, Yo-Landi.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.808
The droids are gonna come down
on our asses, okay?

13:28.975 --> 13:30.769
- They'll hit us harder.
- It's true.

13:30.935 --> 13:33.521
Guys, we need, like, a remote.

13:33.688 --> 13:35.982
- Like a switch.
- What? Excuse me?

13:36.524 --> 13:40.070
Okay, the robots are
like machines, right?

13:40.236 --> 13:41.321
Like a TV.

13:41.488 --> 13:44.532
So if we had a remote
to switch it off....

13:44.699 --> 13:46.034
That's brilliant.

13:46.201 --> 13:51.414
We need to find the guy who makes
the robots and steal his remotes.

14:01.299 --> 14:02.300
Dexter?

14:02.467 --> 14:05.136
Hello, Deon. Welcome home.

14:05.804 --> 14:08.181
- Have you been a good boy today?
- Yes, Deon.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.810
- Yeah? Did you clean my room?
- Your room has been sterilized.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.395
Nice.

14:13.812 --> 14:17.899
Are you working on your artificial
intelligence program tonight?

14:18.066 --> 14:20.527
- Yes.
- I will activate the kettle.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.074
<i>Okay.</i>

14:26.241 --> 14:27.409
<i>Hello again.</i>

14:27.575 --> 14:30.412
<i>So it's day 944.</i>

14:30.578 --> 14:32.497
<i>I'm extremely close now.</i>

14:32.664 --> 14:35.291
<i>There's always chance of error,
I'm aware of this.</i>

14:35.458 --> 14:39.254
<i>But statistically speaking,
I think I might be on track.</i>

14:39.421 --> 14:42.424
<i>I have several terabytes
of compiling and coding to do...</i>

14:42.590 --> 14:44.342
<i>...and then we shall see.</i>

14:44.509 --> 14:46.511
<i>All right? See you in a bit.</i>

14:52.642 --> 14:54.769
- Look. That's the motherfucker.
- Him?

14:56.896 --> 14:59.190
Dude, it's gonna be so easy.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.569
We need those remotes, my man.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.238
We need those remotes.

15:07.615 --> 15:08.742
Red Bull!

15:08.908 --> 15:10.243
Yes, Deon.

15:11.202 --> 15:12.662
Red Bull.

15:17.459 --> 15:18.793
Okay.

15:39.522 --> 15:40.899
Come on.

15:43.234 --> 15:44.861
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.238
What if you change the...?

16:14.182 --> 16:16.726
- It's stable.
- Is everything okay?

16:19.896 --> 16:21.022
It's stable.

16:22.273 --> 16:23.608
<i>My God.</i>

16:23.775 --> 16:25.318
<i>I think I've cracked it.</i>

16:25.485 --> 16:28.988
<i>Of course, to really know,
I must test it on a live system.</i>

16:29.906 --> 16:31.491
<i>I must test it.</i>

16:40.291 --> 16:41.584
All right.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.462
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.675
Hey. Hey!

16:48.842 --> 16:51.219
- Hey. Where's the Scout?
- How's it, sir? What?

16:51.386 --> 16:55.473
- The Scout, man, 22 for demolition.
- Guys are prepping the compactor.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.767
- It goes in soon.
- Oh, thank God.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.438
- Don't destroy it yet, okay?
- <i>Ja</i>, sure.

17:01.604 --> 17:04.107
Just wait for me,
but don't destroy it, okay?

17:05.775 --> 17:08.819
- Hello, ma'am.
- Morning, Deon.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.489
All right. Let's have it.

17:11.656 --> 17:15.577
- What are you proposing now?
- Ma'am, I think I've cracked it.

17:15.743 --> 17:19.204
The world's first proper,
full artificial intelligence.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.625
This is a computer system
that might be smarter than a human.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.711
I could show it a piece of art...

17:24.877 --> 17:28.757
...and this thing, this being,
could judge that art.

17:28.923 --> 17:32.260
It could decide if it liked it.

17:32.427 --> 17:34.846
It could write music and poetry.

17:35.013 --> 17:36.514
Okay. Stop.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.141
Please, Deon.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.602
Do you realize you just came...

17:40.769 --> 17:43.897
...to the CEO of a publicly traded
weapons corporation...

17:44.064 --> 17:46.900
...and pitched a robot
that can write poems?

17:47.067 --> 17:49.152
Well, if you just let me explain...

17:49.319 --> 17:53.031
Deon, Tetravaal is very happy
with you.

17:53.198 --> 17:55.325
The Scouts are a huge success.

17:55.492 --> 17:58.328
Ma'am, look,
it won't cost you anything.

17:58.495 --> 18:02.040
A droid downstairs was written off
yesterday, smashed beyond repair.

18:02.207 --> 18:04.292
Let me install this on it.

18:04.459 --> 18:07.671
- Please just let me test it.
- No. No, I'm sorry, Deon.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.173
You know
how insurance works for those...

18:10.340 --> 18:12.801
...all the red tape and the paperwork.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.844
Thank you for your time.

18:23.144 --> 18:27.440
<i>All new employees, please report
to Human Resources for orientation.</i>

18:32.237 --> 18:33.530
Shit.

18:34.656 --> 18:35.657
Hey, Bill.

18:55.218 --> 18:56.970
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

18:57.137 --> 19:00.640
<i>Remember to have your security pass
visible at all times.</i>

19:02.058 --> 19:04.686
Hey. Can you give me
a hand over here?

19:34.341 --> 19:35.967
Come on. Come on.

19:38.636 --> 19:39.721
Come on.

19:47.562 --> 19:48.813
Thank you.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.362
Yep. Showtime.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.086
- What's up, homes?
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

20:13.797 --> 20:16.049
Please! Hey, what is it?

20:16.216 --> 20:18.593
This is you getting hijacked, my friend.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.011
Welcome to Joburg.

20:23.306 --> 20:26.810
And these are all part
of what makes the Moose unique...

20:26.976 --> 20:29.270
...and perfect for you
at the department.

20:29.437 --> 20:32.565
The strategic ability to neutralize
the enemy's targets.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.527
High-value targets:
radar installations...

20:35.694 --> 20:37.821
...aircraft, fuel storage locations.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.906
- Aircraft?
- Yes, sir.

20:41.366 --> 20:43.535
We're taking out an enemy's aircraft?

20:43.702 --> 20:45.829
We are talking
about urban crimes here?

20:45.995 --> 20:48.873
You know, muggings,
carjackings, loitering.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.710
I'm talking all kinds of targets, sir.
Low to high.

20:51.876 --> 20:54.129
I do believe you need
a weapons platform...

20:54.295 --> 20:57.757
...that can fire warheads
with precision and reliability.

20:57.924 --> 21:01.636
And might I add, sir, all under
the control of a human operator.

21:02.429 --> 21:03.596
Look, Miss Bradley...

21:03.763 --> 21:07.726
...the police force is very happy
with the Scouts. Very, very happy.

21:07.892 --> 21:10.270
- We just ordered new droids.
- Thank you.

21:10.437 --> 21:13.064
We've been very successful
at bringing down crime.

21:13.231 --> 21:15.316
But this? No, we don't want this.

21:15.483 --> 21:19.779
I mean, look at it. It's overkill.
It's expensive, it's big, and it's ugly.

21:19.946 --> 21:24.075
It'll have to get a hell of a lot worse
for us to even consider this.

21:24.993 --> 21:26.578
A hell of a lot worse.

21:26.745 --> 21:28.663
No, I think we're done here.

21:28.830 --> 21:31.708
Well, thank you,
Commissioner Steenkamp.

21:31.875 --> 21:33.960
We'll get you those Scouts.

21:56.608 --> 21:58.485
Wakey, wakey.

22:01.863 --> 22:04.366
Please.
Please, I don't have much money.

22:04.532 --> 22:06.368
Shut up. I don't want your money.

22:06.534 --> 22:10.205
- We know who you are, my friend.
- We know you make the robots.

22:10.372 --> 22:12.123
No, there must be a mistake.

22:12.290 --> 22:13.500
I mean....

22:14.918 --> 22:16.670
Stop playing dumb with us!

22:17.379 --> 22:21.257
We know you have some kind of TV
remote thing to switch those robots off.

22:21.424 --> 22:23.718
- Excuse me?
- It's a machine.

22:23.885 --> 22:25.261
It's got an on-off switch.

22:25.428 --> 22:28.056
- Maybe there's one in the van.
- <i>Ja,</i> check the van.

22:28.223 --> 22:30.725
- Cut his feet off.
- That's a good idea, Amerika.

22:30.892 --> 22:34.270
- No, no, no! No, please! Help!
- Yo, man, that's a good idea.

22:34.437 --> 22:37.357
You can get yourself
a nice, funky wheelchair.

22:37.524 --> 22:39.984
No, please listen.
You cannot switch them off.

22:40.151 --> 22:41.486
Bullshit! It's a machine.

22:41.653 --> 22:43.988
They have a firmware lock.
They're always on.

22:44.155 --> 22:45.365
Just shoot him, man.

22:45.532 --> 22:47.701
Please! Please, don't! No!

22:49.828 --> 22:51.705
Y'all gotta see this.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.669
Jesus Christ.

22:57.836 --> 22:59.629
He managed to turn this one off.

22:59.796 --> 23:03.967
There's legs and shit all over the place.
Was he gonna build it or something?

23:04.551 --> 23:05.927
You know what?

23:06.094 --> 23:09.848
What if we get him to program
this bad boy to fight for us?

23:10.015 --> 23:13.685
Like an indestructible robot gangsta,
number one, son.

23:14.352 --> 23:15.645
Hey.

23:15.812 --> 23:18.565
Listen, my friend,
we know about your little buddy...

23:18.732 --> 23:20.650
...you're trying to hide from us.

23:20.817 --> 23:22.694
I wasn't hiding anything.

23:22.861 --> 23:26.072
Either you reprogram that robot
in the van to work for us...

23:26.239 --> 23:28.199
...or we fucking shoot you right now.

23:28.366 --> 23:30.368
What do you mean, "reprogram him"?

23:30.535 --> 23:33.204
- Don't play dumb!
- You know exactly what we mean.

23:33.371 --> 23:36.207
Turn that robot
into the illest gangsta on the block.

23:36.374 --> 23:39.502
We use him to make some moves
and make some real money.

23:40.879 --> 23:43.214
The one in my van is a test.

23:44.591 --> 23:47.260
It's never been tried,
but if it works, you can...

23:47.427 --> 23:49.304
...train him to do what you want.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.222
What do you mean, "if it works"?

23:51.389 --> 23:53.308
It's a new project I'm working on.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.894
It makes the robot have a mind
like a human.

23:56.061 --> 23:58.229
But it's like a child in the beginning.

23:58.396 --> 24:00.065
Like a human baby, but smarter.

24:00.607 --> 24:04.027
Its AI can learn much faster
than any organic intelligence.

24:04.194 --> 24:06.613
- But it has to be taught.
- Well, for how long?

24:06.780 --> 24:08.740
- I don't know! It's untested.
- Enough.

24:08.907 --> 24:11.785
This is your only option!
I'm telling you:

24:11.951 --> 24:15.163
You cannot switch them off
and you cannot hack the others.

24:15.330 --> 24:17.415
Please, I don't wanna die.

24:29.844 --> 24:33.890
It's just plug and play. Quick release.
Snap on and snap off.

24:35.183 --> 24:38.311
- Why is all its legs off?
- It was scheduled for destruction.

24:38.478 --> 24:41.147
- Why?
- Because it's damaged.

24:41.314 --> 24:43.274
The battery's fused with the chassis.

24:43.441 --> 24:44.567
What?

24:45.360 --> 24:48.738
- It means you can't change the battery.
- How long will it last?

24:48.905 --> 24:50.281
- Shit.
- Oh, shit.

24:50.448 --> 24:52.826
About five days, until the battery dies.

24:52.992 --> 24:56.371
- This thing will only run for five days?
- Roughly, yes.

25:06.589 --> 25:07.590
What is that?

25:07.757 --> 25:10.552
A Guard Key.
You need it to install new software.

25:15.515 --> 25:17.225
Come on, man.

25:22.313 --> 25:24.149
Remember I said it has to learn?

25:24.315 --> 25:26.735
I have to come back
and help to teach it.

25:26.901 --> 25:28.611
Otherwise, this is pointless.

25:28.778 --> 25:30.905
Fine. Just switch it on.

25:32.157 --> 25:35.910
Switch the thing on now, my friend.

25:37.203 --> 25:38.830
Now!

25:57.390 --> 25:58.683
Oh, shit.

25:58.850 --> 26:00.935
Give it space. Give it space.

26:01.102 --> 26:02.729
It's okay. Give it space.

26:02.896 --> 26:05.065
Please, please, please.
Put the gun down.

26:06.566 --> 26:07.942
Dude.

26:08.109 --> 26:09.319
Come on.

26:09.486 --> 26:10.653
Hey.

26:11.529 --> 26:13.198
Hey. Come on out.

26:13.365 --> 26:15.950
Hey, come here.
Come here, little buddy.

26:16.117 --> 26:17.702
Come here. Come here.

26:17.869 --> 26:19.037
Come out.

26:20.288 --> 26:22.165
Come... Get the fuck out!

26:22.332 --> 26:25.960
Please! It doesn't understand English yet.
It doesn't understand you.

26:26.127 --> 26:27.879
You gave me a retarded robot?

26:28.046 --> 26:29.756
You're scaring it.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.801
Just go in the kitchen.

26:33.885 --> 26:37.097
Ninjie-kun, just go in the kitchen.
I've got this.

26:37.263 --> 26:40.934
I'll get it. Just go get a beer
or something.

26:42.143 --> 26:43.937
<i>Hey. Come on.</i>

26:45.563 --> 26:46.898
<i>Come on.</i>

26:47.065 --> 26:49.067
<i>Can he not understand me?</i>

26:49.901 --> 26:51.111
<i>It worked.</i>

26:51.277 --> 26:52.779
Yo, computer boy.

26:53.613 --> 26:56.199
Can he understand me when I speak?

26:56.366 --> 26:57.867
No. No, not yet.

26:58.785 --> 26:59.994
Soon.

27:00.995 --> 27:03.039
Hey. It's okay.

27:03.623 --> 27:05.333
- Come.
- Come out.

27:06.042 --> 27:07.711
<i>- Come out.
- That's it.</i>

27:07.877 --> 27:09.587
<i>- Here we go. Come.
- Come on.</i>

27:09.754 --> 27:11.840
<i>Come. No one's gonna hurt you.</i>

27:12.007 --> 27:13.550
See? That's it.

27:13.717 --> 27:14.968
Come.

27:15.510 --> 27:16.928
Come.

27:17.095 --> 27:18.430
That's good.

27:18.596 --> 27:20.140
That's good. Come.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.684
I know you don't understand,
but it's okay.

27:22.851 --> 27:25.520
Come. Here we go.

27:27.439 --> 27:30.817
- It's okay.
- It's some crazy shit, eh?

27:36.364 --> 27:37.365
<i>You want that?</i>

27:38.783 --> 27:40.118
You like that?

27:46.624 --> 27:48.168
He's so cute.

27:48.335 --> 27:50.503
Like a baby, eh?

27:52.172 --> 27:53.214
<i>That's a watch.</i>

27:53.381 --> 27:54.674
<i>That's a watch.</i>

28:01.806 --> 28:03.224
<i>Watch.</i>

28:05.435 --> 28:06.478
Watch.

28:09.564 --> 28:11.358
- That's amazing.
- Watch.

28:11.524 --> 28:12.901
Wait, wait, wait.

28:13.068 --> 28:14.986
I'm just gonna get one more thing.

28:22.494 --> 28:23.578
It's good.

28:24.204 --> 28:25.872
- Hey.
- It's okay.

28:26.373 --> 28:27.582
Hey.

28:30.335 --> 28:32.837
What's this? Hey, look at this.

28:34.881 --> 28:36.341
Look at this. Listen.

28:37.717 --> 28:38.843
Hey.

28:40.970 --> 28:42.472
That's a chicken.

28:43.682 --> 28:44.974
<i>Yeah.</i>

28:46.309 --> 28:47.602
<i>Chicken.</i>

28:50.980 --> 28:51.981
Chicken.

28:57.529 --> 28:59.447
Yo-lan-di.

29:00.615 --> 29:02.575
Yo-lan-di.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.786
<i>Ja, </i> good.

29:07.372 --> 29:08.623
Deon.

29:09.749 --> 29:11.001
Deon.

29:13.128 --> 29:14.379
You look so happy.

29:15.255 --> 29:17.298
Like a little happy chappie.

29:18.258 --> 29:21.511
That's it. That's your name. "Chappie."

29:22.595 --> 29:25.473
No. No, no, no. No, his name is not...

29:25.640 --> 29:28.059
- Chappie.
- <i>Ja,</i> I like that.

29:28.226 --> 29:30.687
- That's good. I like that. Chappie.
- Okay.

29:30.854 --> 29:32.814
- Chicken.
- Chicken. Yeah.

29:33.690 --> 29:36.067
What the fuck is this?

29:36.234 --> 29:38.111
We're just orienting it.

29:38.278 --> 29:39.404
Chicken.

29:39.571 --> 29:40.822
- Come here!
- No, no, no.

29:40.989 --> 29:43.908
Wait! Wait! I need to get
the Guard Key out of his head.

29:45.785 --> 29:49.330
- I'll orient you if I ever see you again.
- He's mine! He's special.

29:49.497 --> 29:52.667
I don't want any confrontation, okay?
I'll see him tomorrow.

29:52.834 --> 29:55.420
You made an agreement.
Let him train the robot.

29:55.587 --> 29:58.173
Let me come and see him
like we agreed. Please.

29:58.715 --> 30:00.300
Okay, okay. I'm coming back.

30:00.467 --> 30:02.177
Chappie, I'll be back!

30:46.763 --> 30:48.098
Where are you?

30:49.391 --> 30:50.767
Where'd you go?

30:53.812 --> 30:55.855
What the hell are you up to, Deon?

31:10.912 --> 31:12.580
What the hell is this? Open.

31:15.291 --> 31:18.461
"Scout 22, Guard Key installed."

32:23.485 --> 32:24.652
<i>He-Man!</i>

32:24.819 --> 32:27.906
<i>And the Masters of the Universe!</i>

32:28.990 --> 32:30.075
<i>I am Adam...</i>

32:30.241 --> 32:34.412
<i>...prince of Eternia and defender
of the secrets of Castle Grayskull.</i>

32:34.579 --> 32:36.331
<i>This is Cringer...</i>

32:36.498 --> 32:38.166
<i>...my fearless friend.</i>

32:38.750 --> 32:41.169
<i>Fabulous secret powers
were revealed to me...</i>

32:41.336 --> 32:44.172
<i>...the day I held aloft
my magic sword and said:</i>

32:44.339 --> 32:46.925
<i>By the power of Grayskull!</i>

32:48.134 --> 32:49.678
<i>He-Man!</i>

32:49.844 --> 32:53.640
<i>I have the power!</i>

32:57.811 --> 32:59.729
Oh, so you watch cartoons?

33:02.148 --> 33:03.400
No, no, no, my friend.

33:04.109 --> 33:06.986
You stay under this roof,
you make money for me.

33:07.153 --> 33:09.656
The first thing you do
is you get your gun.

33:09.823 --> 33:12.659
Then you cock your gun.
Now it's ready to shoot, <i>nè?</i>

33:12.826 --> 33:14.327
Now you choose your target.

33:14.494 --> 33:17.288
I wanna shoot that blue bottle,
there in the front.

33:17.455 --> 33:18.957
Have a look. Nice and easy.

33:19.124 --> 33:23.378
So I aim at the blue bottle, like,
there it is. I'm like, "Okay, and..."

33:24.421 --> 33:28.675
Now I'm gonna shoot the green bottle.
Okay, look, I aim and pow! See?

33:28.842 --> 33:30.885
Now I'm gonna shoot the yellow one.

33:31.052 --> 33:32.178
See, it's easy.

33:32.345 --> 33:34.514
Just aim the gun, and...

33:37.559 --> 33:39.352
Come here. Come, come, come.

33:39.519 --> 33:43.398
Come here. Come here. Stand here.
Now, listen, take the gun.

33:43.940 --> 33:46.443
Hold the gun proper...
Just straighten your arm.

33:46.609 --> 33:48.903
Just hold the fucking gun properly,
Chappie.

33:49.654 --> 33:51.489
Jesus Christ. Okay.

33:51.656 --> 33:54.117
One, two, three.

33:56.703 --> 33:58.663
Jesus, my bag.

34:00.040 --> 34:02.334
Don't drop my gun, Chappie!

34:02.751 --> 34:05.170
You fucked up my sight.
This shit's expensive.

34:05.337 --> 34:08.089
- What are you doing?
- Teaching him to shoot.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.632
You shouldn't be doing this shit
with him yet.

34:10.800 --> 34:13.261
Deon said he has to be orientated first.

34:13.428 --> 34:16.681
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna go
and get the weed on my own.

34:16.848 --> 34:19.100
Without the stupid fucking robot.

34:19.266 --> 34:21.101
And I'm gonna make all the money...

34:21.268 --> 34:23.813
...so we can buy the explosives
to do this heist.

34:23.980 --> 34:26.107
Or else we're fucking dead.

34:26.274 --> 34:28.568
He's not stupid. He's just a kid.

34:28.735 --> 34:31.780
Go do your nails
and play with your titanium baby!

34:46.085 --> 34:47.795
You having a baby, man?

34:49.255 --> 34:53.092
Still a baby yourself, aren't you?
Whoa, hey. What happened, man?

34:53.259 --> 34:56.388
Jeez. You got a little bit rowdy
at the bar with your mates?

34:56.554 --> 35:00.225
If you ever wanna come out with me,
go hit the heavy bag at the gym...

35:00.392 --> 35:02.727
...we could nut out a few great moves.

35:02.894 --> 35:04.688
- I'll show you how to scrap.
- Yeah.

35:04.854 --> 35:07.565
Always gotta be ready.
You know what I'm saying?

35:07.732 --> 35:10.610
- Want in?
- Thanks for the offer, but I'm good.

35:10.777 --> 35:12.904
No worries. Well, anytime.

35:13.071 --> 35:15.907
It's real cool, man. It's really cool.

35:16.074 --> 35:18.159
Hey, listen, bit of a favor.

35:18.326 --> 35:20.328
Just wanted to borrow the Guard Key...

35:20.495 --> 35:23.331
...so I can check Scout security levels
with my design.

35:23.498 --> 35:27.085
I just wanna make sure that the Moose
is as secure as the Scouts.

35:27.252 --> 35:28.503
- Borrow it?
- Yeah.

35:28.670 --> 35:31.256
Michelle asked me
to check on the security, so....

35:31.423 --> 35:33.133
Yeah, just an hour or something.

35:35.093 --> 35:37.262
Vincent,
you know I can't do that, right?

35:37.429 --> 35:40.974
- There are clear rules about that.
- Blah-blah-blah.

35:41.141 --> 35:42.684
Mate, don't be such a wowser.

35:42.851 --> 35:45.729
One engineer to another,
asking for the Guard Key.

35:45.895 --> 35:48.314
- "Engineer"? Weren't you a soldier?
- Yeah.

35:48.481 --> 35:50.984
- Look, I'm only joking.
- That's funny. Yeah.

35:51.151 --> 35:53.028
You'd have to tell the Board of...

35:53.194 --> 35:56.614
I spent two years at DARPA,
you whacker.

35:56.781 --> 36:00.493
And, yeah, I was SASR,
you little stickybeak.

36:02.412 --> 36:05.373
You're making me as cross
as a frog in a sock, mate.

36:05.540 --> 36:07.876
Your robots have drained
all my funding.

36:08.043 --> 36:10.170
You're a big problem for me,
you get me?

36:10.337 --> 36:13.798
So I'm gonna start asking you slowly,
you dipstick.

36:13.965 --> 36:19.012
Give me the Guard Key.

36:19.763 --> 36:21.097
No.

36:25.727 --> 36:27.520
Just taking a piss, man.

36:27.687 --> 36:29.481
Just taking a piss.

36:29.647 --> 36:31.358
Come on, man, look. Empty.

36:31.524 --> 36:33.485
As if I'd carry live rounds here.

36:33.651 --> 36:37.072
It's a prank. Everyone go back
to work, man. Come on.

36:37.989 --> 36:39.616
Oh, by the way. Church.

36:39.783 --> 36:42.243
Any Sunday, mate, you're welcome.
Come with me.

36:42.410 --> 36:43.995
To all of you. All welcome.

36:45.246 --> 36:47.123
It's just a prank, man.

36:48.458 --> 36:50.585
This office has gotta lighten up.

37:17.320 --> 37:20.240
Where are you going, mate?
Where are you going?

37:24.577 --> 37:26.287
Shoe.

37:27.080 --> 37:29.874
Say "shoe."

37:30.041 --> 37:31.835
It's for your foot, bro.

37:32.002 --> 37:35.714
Wait, wait. Chappie, look.
Look. Look.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.549
"Rat." It's okay.

37:37.716 --> 37:40.135
No, he's stupid.
He can't talk. We're screwed.

37:40.301 --> 37:42.804
No, he can talk. He's smart.

37:42.971 --> 37:45.181
No, he can talk. He's smart.

37:45.348 --> 37:49.102
- Oh, my God. Look, he's copying me!
- Oh, my God. Look, he's copying me!

37:49.269 --> 37:52.731
- Chappie! Chappie, say "shoe."
- Shoe.

37:52.897 --> 37:55.233
- Say "rat."
- Rat.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.235
Say "Mommy."

37:57.402 --> 37:59.404
Say Mommy.

38:00.488 --> 38:01.698
Chappie.

38:01.865 --> 38:02.991
- Shoe.
- Shoe.

38:03.158 --> 38:04.200
- Rat.
- Rat.

38:04.367 --> 38:05.869
- Mommy.
- Mommy.

38:06.036 --> 38:07.203
- Amerika.
- Homes.

38:07.370 --> 38:08.830
Amerika homes.

38:08.997 --> 38:10.165
Amerika homes.

38:10.331 --> 38:11.916
- Good, Chappie.
- Oh, shit.

38:12.083 --> 38:14.294
That homes is a clever little robot.

38:14.461 --> 38:17.297
That homes is a clever little robot
right there.

38:18.256 --> 38:21.926
- This motherfucker talks ghetto.
- This fuck mother talks ghetto.

38:22.093 --> 38:25.555
All right, you the rudest bad boy
in Joburg.

38:26.222 --> 38:28.058
Chappie be the rudest bad boy...

38:28.224 --> 38:30.977
...streetwise professor in Joburg,
fuck mother!

38:31.144 --> 38:34.105
- Yes! Yes! It's gonna work, man.
- Yes! Yes! Fuck mother!

38:34.272 --> 38:36.483
- He's so smart!
- I can work with this.

38:36.649 --> 38:38.610
All right, let's pound it out.

38:38.777 --> 38:40.028
Like this.

38:40.195 --> 38:41.404
Go bloop!

38:41.571 --> 38:44.032
Boom, Chappie, go boom.

38:44.199 --> 38:45.241
Bloop!

38:54.376 --> 38:57.087
You hear that? Somebody's here.

39:00.173 --> 39:02.258
- Who's here, Mommy?
- I don't know.

39:06.262 --> 39:07.430
Hello?

39:12.310 --> 39:13.561
It's the nerd.

39:13.728 --> 39:16.147
What? No.

39:17.023 --> 39:18.024
Hello.

39:18.191 --> 39:20.985
- You shouldn't be here. Go.
- I'm here to see my...

39:21.152 --> 39:24.322
No. He's coming back soon.
You're lucky to be alive.

39:42.549 --> 39:45.552
- I'm just gonna say hello, if...
- What is that stuff?

39:45.719 --> 39:48.722
I'm here to teach him.
Like we agreed. Yeah?

39:48.888 --> 39:51.725
You're gonna catch a bullet
hanging around here, nerd.

39:54.811 --> 39:56.813
Hello, my little one.

39:56.980 --> 39:58.356
Hello.

39:59.190 --> 40:00.775
Have we learnt this word yet?

40:02.944 --> 40:04.779
Hey.

40:05.321 --> 40:06.740
What's up, fuck mother?

40:08.575 --> 40:10.118
How's shit?

40:11.578 --> 40:13.038
Where did you learn that?

40:13.204 --> 40:14.622
- These guys?
- Hey, hey, hey.

40:14.789 --> 40:17.459
Watch your mouth.
Before you get yourself shanked.

40:17.625 --> 40:20.712
Better watch your mouth.
You're gonna get yourself shanked.

40:20.879 --> 40:23.840
Chappie, please, have respect for me.
I'm your maker.

40:24.007 --> 40:26.551
Please. If I could just have
a moment with him.

40:26.718 --> 40:27.761
Excuse me?

40:27.927 --> 40:31.973
You know, surely you can go and count
your narcotics in another room.

40:32.140 --> 40:35.352
You come in here, tell me where to go,
where to do my work?

40:35.518 --> 40:37.687
- I don't mean to impose.
- Shut your mouth.

40:37.854 --> 40:40.023
- I'll cut your tongue out.
- I'm sorry.

40:40.190 --> 40:42.233
Okay, Amerika, Amerika, Amerika.

40:42.400 --> 40:44.611
Don't count drugs in front of the kid.

40:44.778 --> 40:46.529
I gotta get this shit done.

40:46.696 --> 40:49.032
By the time I finish,
you'd better be gone.

40:49.199 --> 40:50.241
Okay. Absolutely.

40:51.034 --> 40:52.327
Chappie.

40:53.244 --> 40:55.372
Listen to me, I'm your maker.

40:55.538 --> 40:57.916
I brought you into this world, okay?

40:58.083 --> 41:02.671
This is serious. Mustn't engage
in these people's lifestyle choices.

41:02.837 --> 41:04.422
- What?
- No offense, okay?

41:05.173 --> 41:09.469
No counting narcotics,
no robberies, no crimes.

41:09.636 --> 41:12.847
- Chappie, no crimes.
- Okay. And you've gotta promise me.

41:13.723 --> 41:14.808
What is promise?

41:14.974 --> 41:19.020
It's that you promise me that you'll
never do any of those things, all right?

41:19.187 --> 41:21.022
You can't break a promise, Chappie.

41:22.482 --> 41:24.526
- Chappie promise.
- Good! Yes! Yes.

41:24.693 --> 41:26.778
Hey! Hey, stop lecturing him.

41:26.945 --> 41:29.030
Come on.
You said you'd teach him stuff.

41:29.197 --> 41:32.283
Yeah, sure. Okay. Come.
Chappie, sit here. Come on.

41:32.450 --> 41:34.994
I brought you things
to help nurture your mind...

41:35.161 --> 41:36.746
...and develop your abilities.

41:36.913 --> 41:40.458
It's important to use your mind, okay?
Here we go.

41:41.876 --> 41:44.504
- What's that?
- That's a book.

41:44.671 --> 41:47.257
It has stories, you see? Look.

41:47.424 --> 41:48.633
Chappie wants it.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.218
That's about a black sheep.

41:50.385 --> 41:52.178
- Chappie's book?
- Yeah, it's yours.

41:53.722 --> 41:54.973
Chappie's got stories.

41:55.890 --> 41:57.434
Chappie's got a book.

41:57.600 --> 42:00.186
Come, Chappie. I'll show you this.

42:00.353 --> 42:02.731
- See, this is a easel.
- Easel.

42:02.897 --> 42:05.608
These are your paints. Look at this.

42:06.401 --> 42:07.402
See that?

42:07.569 --> 42:09.821
- Blue.
- Yeah, like the sky.

42:10.488 --> 42:12.157
Blue like the sky.

42:12.991 --> 42:18.163
Listen, Chappie, in life, lots of people
will try to tell you what you can't do.

42:18.329 --> 42:19.914
And you must never listen.

42:20.081 --> 42:23.335
If you wanna paint, you can.
You can do anything in your life.

42:23.501 --> 42:25.128
Chappie wants to paint.

42:25.295 --> 42:27.464
Don't let people take away
your potential.

42:28.089 --> 42:30.008
I'm not stopping him painting.

42:30.175 --> 42:31.634
Go. Paint, Chappie.

42:37.807 --> 42:40.477
Paint your colors on here,
like this. See?

42:41.394 --> 42:43.188
- Yeah.
- Let's have fun.

42:43.355 --> 42:44.814
- Yeah, I want it.
- Yeah.

42:44.981 --> 42:47.400
Give. Give it to Chappie. Give.

42:47.567 --> 42:49.027
What's the word?

42:50.862 --> 42:52.947
Please,
may I have the paintings, Deon?

42:53.114 --> 42:55.116
What in the name of the Lord?

42:56.076 --> 42:59.496
That's it. Put your paint in there.
Put it on the board.

43:01.498 --> 43:03.458
There's the Guard Key.

43:03.917 --> 43:05.502
- Chappie is painting.
- Yeah!

43:06.086 --> 43:07.754
Chappie, I'm so proud of you!

43:07.921 --> 43:09.172
Good boy!

43:11.633 --> 43:15.095
You just made a big mistake,
my friend.

43:16.221 --> 43:17.722
Looks nice, doesn't it?

43:17.889 --> 43:19.599
There you go. Go on.

43:21.184 --> 43:23.478
Okay. Go on. Don't be shy.

43:37.909 --> 43:39.786
You painted that car.

43:41.663 --> 43:42.914
- Car.
- Well done!

43:43.081 --> 43:45.500
- It's a car, Mommy.
- That's good, Chappie!

43:45.667 --> 43:47.127
Paint more?

44:11.484 --> 44:12.986
Chappie.

44:13.153 --> 44:15.613
- Are you serious?
- We were just paint...

44:16.197 --> 44:17.949
I need a killing machine!

44:18.116 --> 44:20.702
- He's not here to paint!
- Don't! Just leave him!

44:20.869 --> 44:23.955
- Stop it!
- We were just teaching him.

44:24.122 --> 44:25.957
- I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
- No!

44:27.208 --> 44:28.710
What are you doing?!

44:28.877 --> 44:32.422
He was just teaching him to paint!
He was just teaching Chappie!

44:32.589 --> 44:34.341
- Yeah, to be a <i>poes!</i>
- He's mine!

44:34.507 --> 44:37.385
I'll call the police on you
for mistreating him!

44:37.552 --> 44:39.929
And tell them what?
You stole a police robot!

44:40.096 --> 44:41.681
You're a filthy person.

44:41.848 --> 44:44.017
You're a terrible, shitty person.

44:45.185 --> 44:46.644
What's wrong with you?

44:53.109 --> 44:55.779
He needs to be taught.
He's just a kid.

44:55.945 --> 44:58.740
He's already smarter
than you'll ever be, philistine!

44:58.907 --> 45:01.951
Chappie, don't let this barbarian ruin
your creativity!

45:02.577 --> 45:04.954
Nurture your creativity, Chappie.

45:06.122 --> 45:10.335
Maybe he's more than just
a stupid robot who shoots people.

45:10.502 --> 45:11.920
Just let him do his stuff.

45:12.087 --> 45:14.631
He is a kid. Don't you understand?

45:14.798 --> 45:17.634
Yo-Landi, we said
we're doing this heist...

45:17.801 --> 45:21.638
...because it's the only way to get us
out of shit before Hippo kills us!

45:21.805 --> 45:23.973
What part of "dead"
don't you understand?

45:24.140 --> 45:26.685
The only way we'll pull it off
is with Chappie.

45:26.851 --> 45:28.520
- What's up, man?
- Am I right?

45:28.687 --> 45:30.230
When? Hold on. Hold on.

45:30.397 --> 45:31.981
- Yo-Landi, am I right?
- Yes.

45:32.148 --> 45:35.026
- Hey, yo, yo, yo. It's Raymond.
- Oh, yeah.

45:35.193 --> 45:38.655
He says there's a cash-move
day after tomorrow. How much?

45:38.822 --> 45:41.866
Six hundred million.
Heading south on the N1, 7 a.m.

45:42.033 --> 45:44.035
Okay, south, N1, 7 a.m.

45:44.202 --> 45:45.870
Yeah.

45:46.037 --> 45:48.081
King. Let's call the King.

45:48.248 --> 45:51.543
We're gonna need a shaped charge.
Tell him we can do the usual.

45:52.460 --> 45:53.795
And get the van.

45:53.962 --> 45:55.547
- The van?
- Now. Yeah.

45:55.714 --> 45:57.007
Yo-Landi.

45:57.549 --> 45:59.259
I'm gonna get us out of this.

45:59.426 --> 46:00.760
I promise.

46:02.804 --> 46:04.848
Hey, what you doing there, little guy?

46:05.015 --> 46:06.391
Paintings.

46:06.933 --> 46:08.476
Oh, that's nice.

46:10.353 --> 46:13.732
- Chappie, you see the house?
- Chappie's house?

46:13.898 --> 46:16.985
Yeah. To help you understand
how nice it is...

46:17.152 --> 46:19.154
...to live here
with Mommy and Daddy...

46:19.320 --> 46:21.614
...I'll take you
to go see the real world...

46:21.781 --> 46:24.075
...to show you how not nice it is.

46:25.785 --> 46:27.746
Okay, you know what?
I got a fun idea.

46:27.912 --> 46:30.373
- Chappie, you like cars, eh?
- Yes, yes.

46:30.540 --> 46:34.711
So why don't we go for a drive
in a real car to see the real world.

46:34.878 --> 46:37.088
I want to come.
Chappie wants to come with.

46:37.255 --> 46:40.008
So, come, let's do it, Chappie.
Let's go for a ride.

46:40.175 --> 46:42.594
Come on. Leave that. Leave that.

46:42.761 --> 46:44.929
Come. Say bye to Mommy.

46:45.972 --> 46:48.183
There you go, Chappie.
Jump into the seat.

46:48.350 --> 46:50.643
- There you go. Sit there.
- What's up, man?

46:50.810 --> 46:53.104
- Chappie's in the car.
- I'll tell you later.

46:53.271 --> 46:56.191
You're sitting nice.
Who's a good boy, Chappie?

46:56.358 --> 46:57.776
Bye, Mommy!

47:00.612 --> 47:03.698
- The real world is very big.
- You like the real world, huh?

47:06.993 --> 47:08.244
What is the Internet?

47:08.411 --> 47:11.998
It's a thing in a computer.
Lets you look up shit you don't know.

47:12.165 --> 47:14.751
I want it! I want that Internet.

47:14.918 --> 47:16.294
Hey, yo.

47:16.795 --> 47:19.005
How's he gonna find
his way back, huh?

47:19.506 --> 47:22.133
He's a big smart robot.
Aren't you, Chappie?

47:22.300 --> 47:24.969
<i>Ja, </i> Chappie's smart.
Chappie has GPS.

47:25.136 --> 47:26.221
You sure about this?

47:26.388 --> 47:28.848
When you get back in,
start paying rent, right?

47:37.315 --> 47:38.817
What is this, Amerika?

47:41.319 --> 47:44.864
- Hey, Chappie, come. Jump out.
- Chappie doesn't want to.

47:45.031 --> 47:47.826
Come, Chappie. Come.
Come, come, come.

47:47.992 --> 47:49.911
- It's a cop!
- Hey, I'm going to go.

47:51.830 --> 47:54.624
- Welcome to the real world.
- Guys, watch it.

47:55.125 --> 47:57.794
- I don't like this real world.
- It's all fucked up.

47:57.961 --> 48:00.296
We gotta toughen you up for the heist.

48:00.463 --> 48:02.382
- Chappie wants to get in.
- Sorry.

48:02.549 --> 48:04.509
Please! Please can I go in the car?!

48:04.676 --> 48:06.219
I want to go back in the car.

48:06.386 --> 48:08.930
Amerika? Please, no!

48:09.097 --> 48:12.308
- It's a hell of a first day of school, eh?
- Please come back!

48:13.018 --> 48:14.519
Please, no!

48:14.686 --> 48:16.354
"Please, no"?

48:16.938 --> 48:18.606
What the hell?

48:20.817 --> 48:22.360
Don't get too close.

48:22.527 --> 48:24.612
- What is that?
- Watch it, man.

48:25.447 --> 48:26.823
Don't trust these fuckers.

48:26.990 --> 48:29.492
- Hello. I'm Chappie.
- He's a pig!

48:29.659 --> 48:30.910
Why you throwing me?

48:32.537 --> 48:33.788
Please, may you not?

48:33.955 --> 48:35.707
This is not a cop, man!

48:35.874 --> 48:37.834
- He's scared!
- Check this out.

48:38.001 --> 48:39.044
Why you do this?

48:39.210 --> 48:40.420
Why you do this?

48:40.587 --> 48:42.672
- "Why you do this?"
- Why you do this?

48:42.839 --> 48:45.091
- It sounds funny.
- Chappie doesn't like it.

48:46.634 --> 48:48.178
Chappie!

48:48.345 --> 48:50.180
<i>No, no! Please! Chappie...</i>

48:50.347 --> 48:52.057
Chappie...

48:52.807 --> 48:54.809
- Check this out, man.
- Pussy!

48:54.976 --> 48:57.854
Please, may you not.
Please, may you not.

48:58.021 --> 48:59.439
He's down for the count.

48:59.606 --> 49:02.233
- Please, no! No!
- Make way, man.

49:02.400 --> 49:04.069
Please, may you leave me?

49:04.235 --> 49:06.571
I want to go home!
I want to go home!

49:11.326 --> 49:13.328
<i>Fuck the police!</i>

49:21.002 --> 49:22.337
Run, bitch, run!

49:27.717 --> 49:30.220
I want to go home!
I want to go home!

49:35.308 --> 49:38.395
Hello, Deon. Welcome home.

49:46.444 --> 49:49.114
Oh, no. Mess, mess.

49:54.411 --> 49:56.079
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, Mr. Wilson.</i>

49:56.246 --> 49:58.289
<i>- Tetravaal Security.</i>
- Yeah.

49:58.456 --> 50:02.168
<i>You signed out the Guard Key
several days ago.</i>

50:02.335 --> 50:05.380
Yeah, no. Sorry, it was a mistake.
I took it home with me.

50:05.547 --> 50:09.050
<i>If it is not here by the end of the day,
I'll notify Miss Bradley.</i>

50:09.217 --> 50:11.177
<i>- Good day to you, sir.</i>
- Thank you.

50:37.829 --> 50:39.247
All right, got him.

50:39.706 --> 50:42.542
Target is on the move, eastbound.
Take the next exit.

51:35.011 --> 51:37.681
Okay.
Three hundred meters up ahead.

51:37.847 --> 51:40.308
Approach slowly.
Stop at a safe distance.

51:40.475 --> 51:44.646
The target appears to be a police droid,
but I can assure you it is not.

51:44.813 --> 51:46.523
Now, don't be intimidated.

51:46.690 --> 51:49.526
He's as smart as a dunny rat,
so full aggression, okay?

51:49.693 --> 51:51.361
- Copy that.
- Copy that.

52:10.964 --> 52:12.132
Oi!

52:16.720 --> 52:18.930
Forget your paintbrush,
did you, mate?

52:19.514 --> 52:22.350
Hey? Well, you're just a little joey,
aren't you?

52:23.351 --> 52:25.937
You look scared.
Where you going, mate?

52:45.248 --> 52:48.251
<i>- Roll him over, roll him over.</i>
- Please, Chappie has fears.

52:48.418 --> 52:50.754
This way.
We need access to his brain.

52:50.920 --> 52:52.839
- No! Please, don't!
- Hey! Damn you!

52:53.006 --> 52:54.466
<i>Just get him down!</i>

52:54.632 --> 52:57.844
- Please, may you not! Please!
<i>- You don't say please to me!</i>

52:58.011 --> 52:59.679
I'm not your friend!

52:59.846 --> 53:02.974
<i>I'm your enemy. Angle grinder.
I'm gonna teach him a lesson!</i>

53:05.101 --> 53:07.854
No! Chappie has fears!
Chappie has fears!

53:08.605 --> 53:10.065
Chappie has fears!

53:10.231 --> 53:12.150
Please, may you stop! Please!

53:15.695 --> 53:18.114
You're gonna be a good boy now,
aren't you?

53:19.282 --> 53:20.700
Roll him over.

53:21.201 --> 53:23.161
That's it. Give me the screwdriver.

53:23.953 --> 53:26.748
See, your simple AI program...

53:26.915 --> 53:29.334
...makes you think you're real.

53:30.543 --> 53:32.629
But you know what's in here, huh?

53:32.796 --> 53:34.089
Nothing.

53:34.255 --> 53:36.257
Just a bunch of wires, mate.

53:36.424 --> 53:38.551
You're not the full quid, are you?

53:40.470 --> 53:41.471
There we go.

53:41.638 --> 53:44.057
Chappie is real.

53:49.521 --> 53:50.772
There we go.

53:53.733 --> 53:55.068
All right.

53:55.902 --> 53:57.153
Let's get rid of him.

53:58.071 --> 53:59.489
Come on. Hold him down.

53:59.656 --> 54:01.074
- Hold him down.
- No, no, no.

54:01.241 --> 54:03.284
- Hold him down!
- No more fears!

54:03.451 --> 54:04.536
Hold him down!

54:04.703 --> 54:06.121
Chappie doesn't want fears!

54:06.287 --> 54:07.997
Chappie doesn't want fears!

54:13.670 --> 54:15.296
Stop the fucking truck!

54:24.556 --> 54:27.017
Cease fire. Cease fire!

54:27.517 --> 54:28.810
Let the cripple go.

54:31.062 --> 54:32.439
I've got what I need.

54:33.231 --> 54:35.191
Run, Forrest!

54:54.336 --> 54:56.129
- It's gonna be so easy.
- Oh, Jesus.

54:56.713 --> 54:58.131
Chappie?

54:59.466 --> 55:02.093
- Chappie.
- I told you it was a bad idea.

55:02.260 --> 55:03.553
Mommy.

55:03.720 --> 55:06.473
- Chappie! Chappie, what happened?
- Mommy.

55:06.639 --> 55:09.726
Oh, my God. Chappie?
Chappie, what happened?

55:10.643 --> 55:12.062
Who did this?

55:12.228 --> 55:14.981
Oh, my God, Chappie.
Sit here. Sit here.

55:15.148 --> 55:16.649
I'm so sorry.

55:17.859 --> 55:19.611
What happened?!

55:19.778 --> 55:21.571
How could you do this?

55:21.738 --> 55:23.198
How?!

55:23.365 --> 55:25.617
He's just a child!

55:25.784 --> 55:27.494
I didn't know this would happen.

55:27.660 --> 55:29.537
I don't even know what happened.

55:29.704 --> 55:30.955
I hate you!

55:31.122 --> 55:33.917
- My arm is gone, Mommy.
- Amerika.

55:34.084 --> 55:37.295
Don't we have those arms, those legs,
that shit in the back?

55:37.462 --> 55:39.798
- Yeah, hold on.
- Do you think you can fix...?

55:39.964 --> 55:44.219
Oh, Chappie. Chappie, let me
just get some of this dirt off you.

55:44.386 --> 55:45.929
Okay.

55:49.057 --> 55:51.601
Chappie, who did this?

55:52.769 --> 55:54.270
A man.

55:54.437 --> 55:56.064
In a van.

55:56.231 --> 55:58.525
A man in a van?

55:58.692 --> 56:01.111
- Did he put you in the van?
- Yeah.

56:01.986 --> 56:03.947
Do you know this man?

56:04.114 --> 56:05.240
No.

56:05.407 --> 56:08.660
- That's bad, <i>ese.</i>
- And there were children also.

56:08.827 --> 56:11.579
And they threw fire,
even though I said please.

56:11.746 --> 56:13.289
Children?

56:13.456 --> 56:15.125
Oh, shame!

56:15.291 --> 56:18.128
- This thing in his head.
- That's pretty messed up.

56:18.294 --> 56:20.672
We need to get this thing back in here.

56:23.800 --> 56:26.219
The man broke it, Mommy.

56:26.386 --> 56:28.221
- He broke on my head.
- I'll fix it.

56:28.388 --> 56:29.931
Are you gonna fix me?

56:30.098 --> 56:31.891
I'm gonna try, buddy.

56:36.229 --> 56:37.981
- So how does this go?
- Here we go.

56:38.148 --> 56:39.983
- Where does that go?
- That's better.

56:40.150 --> 56:44.362
All right. Here we go, buddy.
Plug and play, just like he said.

56:47.490 --> 56:49.242
How does that...?

56:51.161 --> 56:52.787
I think that's it.

56:53.288 --> 56:54.622
Can you move it? Try it.

56:54.789 --> 56:57.083
Try. Try and move your arm.

56:58.793 --> 57:01.129
- There we go. It's working.
- I move it.

57:01.296 --> 57:02.839
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

57:03.006 --> 57:05.133
- All right, buddy.
- Oh, Jesus. Thank God.

57:05.300 --> 57:07.969
- You're indestructible, homes.
- I'm indestructible?

57:08.136 --> 57:10.805
Titanium. Indestructible. That's you.

57:12.265 --> 57:14.642
That's my book?
That's <i>Black Sheep?</i>

57:14.809 --> 57:16.686
- What?
- Please, may I have it?

57:16.853 --> 57:19.773
This is from my maker.
<i>Black Sheep and Little Bird.</i>

57:19.939 --> 57:21.608
- Please, may you read it?
- Yeah.

57:21.775 --> 57:25.236
- Please, may you read it?
- Yeah, I can read it for you, Chappie.

57:27.238 --> 57:30.575
"All the sheep in Magooville
were white.

57:31.785 --> 57:35.163
But Abel was a black sheep."

57:35.622 --> 57:38.291
- Do you know what's a black sheep?
- No.

57:38.458 --> 57:42.337
It's, like, when you're different
to everyone else.

57:42.921 --> 57:45.632
Like me. I look different,
from you and Amerika.

57:45.799 --> 57:47.342
- Yeah.
- And the boys.

57:47.509 --> 57:50.804
Yeah, but it's not so much
how you look.

57:51.388 --> 57:55.725
It's special, like what's inside.

57:56.142 --> 57:58.103
That's what makes you different.

57:58.269 --> 58:01.773
See, it's who you really are.

58:02.190 --> 58:03.316
Inside.

58:03.483 --> 58:05.068
Your soul.

58:07.237 --> 58:09.114
Chappie's inside here?

58:10.490 --> 58:11.741
You see...

58:11.908 --> 58:14.077
...the outside, this...

58:14.244 --> 58:16.246
...this is just temporary.

58:16.413 --> 58:22.210
When you die, the soul inside
goes to the next place.

58:23.503 --> 58:25.422
The thing inside...

58:26.589 --> 58:29.467
...see, that's what Mommy loves.

58:30.051 --> 58:32.971
Come. Mommy loves you.

58:35.557 --> 58:37.267
Okay. Come.

58:37.434 --> 58:39.352
Let's read your book.

58:40.895 --> 58:45.900
"Abel would help his mommy
do the housework on weekends.

58:46.067 --> 58:49.988
He would do all the dishes
and the laundry.

58:50.155 --> 58:54.034
Abel was a happy sheep,
but one day...."

59:26.983 --> 59:28.943
Hello, Chappie.

59:29.944 --> 59:31.780
Hello, Mommy.

59:32.489 --> 59:35.408
You're a black sheep, Chappie.
You're special.

59:35.825 --> 59:38.203
- I know, Mommy.
- Hi, Chappie.

59:47.671 --> 59:49.089
Chappie.

59:49.547 --> 59:52.467
Sometimes, people make mistakes.

59:52.634 --> 59:55.553
I'm really, really, really sorry, Chappie.

59:58.014 --> 59:59.265
Do you forgive me?

59:59.432 --> 01:00:00.684
Forgive?

01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:02.143
Come here.

01:00:04.938 --> 01:00:06.439
Come, Chappie.

01:00:06.606 --> 01:00:08.692
Let's you and me reset.

01:00:08.858 --> 01:00:11.361
Reset? Forgive?

01:00:11.528 --> 01:00:15.907
And we're gonna make you nice
and tough and strong...

01:00:16.074 --> 01:00:18.910
...like a fucking robot gangsta,
number one, <i>nè?</i>

01:00:19.077 --> 01:00:20.328
Gangsta number one.

01:00:20.495 --> 01:00:22.163
- Boom.
- Boom.

01:00:22.914 --> 01:00:25.542
From now on,
I'm gonna be your daddy. For real.

01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:27.919
You gonna be Chappie's daddy?

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.547
- What's...? What's up?
- Nothing.

01:00:30.714 --> 01:00:33.133
- What's that, Chappie?
- That's nothing.

01:00:33.299 --> 01:00:34.592
Show me.

01:00:35.593 --> 01:00:36.720
It's Mommy.

01:00:36.886 --> 01:00:39.806
If you wanna be in the gang,
be cool like Daddy!

01:00:39.973 --> 01:00:41.683
Put the thing down!

01:00:42.308 --> 01:00:43.560
Now!

01:00:43.727 --> 01:00:46.479
If you wanna be cool,
you have to act cool.

01:00:47.022 --> 01:00:49.024
Look how Daddy walks.
Look how cool.

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:51.693
- You need to keep it gangsta.
- Keep it gangsta.

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:52.944
<i>Ja,</i> be cool.

01:00:53.111 --> 01:00:55.071
- Don't laugh. I'm being cool.
- No.

01:00:55.238 --> 01:00:58.074
Even when you pull a gun,
be cool like this. Boom!

01:00:58.241 --> 01:00:59.743
Now, you try.

01:01:00.452 --> 01:01:02.245
Die, fuck mother! Boom!

01:01:02.412 --> 01:01:06.124
Yes, Chappie! That's what you do
when you shoot motherfuckers.

01:01:07.208 --> 01:01:08.585
No, I can't shoot peoples.

01:01:09.586 --> 01:01:10.837
What?

01:01:11.004 --> 01:01:13.048
I can't. They didn't do anything to me.

01:01:13.214 --> 01:01:17.052
<i>Ja,</i> but what happens
if he pulls a gun on you?

01:01:17.218 --> 01:01:20.013
I'm titanium. I'm invincible.
Amerika says.

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:23.975
Yeah, but you can't let a motherfucker
disrespect you, homes.

01:01:24.142 --> 01:01:27.020
How you gonna do the heist
if you don't shoot people?

01:01:28.104 --> 01:01:31.483
I can't do a heist. A heist is a crimes.
I promised my maker...

01:01:31.649 --> 01:01:35.904
You were doing so fucking well.
Why do you have to fuck it up?

01:01:36.071 --> 01:01:37.822
No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay.

01:01:37.989 --> 01:01:39.532
- I promised.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:01:39.699 --> 01:01:44.329
It's okay. Hey. Let's worry about
that later, okay? I got this, all right?

01:01:45.955 --> 01:01:46.956
You.

01:01:48.291 --> 01:01:49.584
You're doing well.

01:01:50.502 --> 01:01:52.462
If somebody really disrespects you...

01:01:52.629 --> 01:01:55.006
...you can deal with them
without using a gun.

01:01:56.174 --> 01:01:57.175
Serious?

01:01:58.551 --> 01:02:01.346
Just stick the knife in.
They relax and go to sleep.

01:02:01.513 --> 01:02:04.516
<i>Ja,</i> you can just make them
go sleepy-weepy.

01:02:04.683 --> 01:02:07.394
It's like a nice thing.
It feels nice, Chappie.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.979
- Take the knife.
- Take the knife?

01:02:10.146 --> 01:02:11.272
Go sleepy-weepy?

01:02:11.439 --> 01:02:12.857
Go like this?

01:02:13.024 --> 01:02:14.567
- Want to sleep, Amerika?
- No.

01:02:14.734 --> 01:02:16.903
- You want to sleep, Daddy?
- No, no, no.

01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:19.114
Daddy's not tired. He's already slept.

01:02:19.864 --> 01:02:22.450
- What is it, Daddy?
- Real gangsters...

01:02:22.617 --> 01:02:24.202
...use this.

01:02:25.787 --> 01:02:27.205
- Nice!
- I got it?

01:02:35.213 --> 01:02:36.381
Do it again! Yeah!

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:39.884
Oh, shit!

01:02:42.012 --> 01:02:43.138
Boom! Nice!

01:02:46.224 --> 01:02:47.267
Nice, Chappie.

01:02:57.527 --> 01:03:00.655
You look nice now, Chappie.
Let's see you.

01:03:00.822 --> 01:03:03.742
- I've got blings? I've got blings?
- Gangsta.

01:03:03.908 --> 01:03:06.411
We're gonna do stuff
to get ready for the heist.

01:03:06.578 --> 01:03:08.830
- No, but...
- No, no, no. Not crimes.

01:03:08.997 --> 01:03:11.875
- Like, special gang stuff.
- Special gang stuff.

01:03:12.042 --> 01:03:14.294
- You wanna come with?
- I wanna come with!

01:03:28.892 --> 01:03:30.101
Okay. Chappie.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:33.521
Now, your job now is to get one
of Daddy's cars back...

01:03:33.688 --> 01:03:35.273
...so we can get the money.

01:03:35.899 --> 01:03:37.275
Who do I get the car from?

01:03:37.442 --> 01:03:40.695
I told you, from the naughty man
who took Daddy's car from me.

01:03:40.862 --> 01:03:44.407
So now you're gonna take the gun
and you point it at him.

01:03:44.574 --> 01:03:46.409
But you don't have to shoot him.

01:03:46.576 --> 01:03:49.245
Give him a fright
so he never takes my car again!

01:03:49.412 --> 01:03:51.790
- Give him a nice big fright!
- Yeah.

01:03:51.956 --> 01:03:53.750
That's good, Chappie. Okay.

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:55.293
Where is he?

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:59.714
I'm gonna show you now.
He's a fucking cock. Asshole.

01:03:59.881 --> 01:04:02.175
Hey. Hey, there's the dick right there.

01:04:06.096 --> 01:04:07.764
- Go get him!
- I'm gonna get him!

01:04:07.931 --> 01:04:09.724
I'm gonna get the cock!

01:04:09.891 --> 01:04:12.894
- I'm gonna get him!
- Go get him! Bring it home, man!

01:04:13.061 --> 01:04:15.730
- Hey! Cock!
- What seems to be the problem, officer?

01:04:15.897 --> 01:04:18.274
You don't steal cars from Daddy!

01:04:18.441 --> 01:04:19.776
You don't...

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:24.906
...steal cars from Daddy!

01:04:25.073 --> 01:04:28.326
- No, don't! What did I do?
- You thief!

01:04:29.119 --> 01:04:30.161
Don't hurt me!

01:04:30.328 --> 01:04:32.247
- No! Jesus!
- What are you doing?!

01:04:32.872 --> 01:04:35.750
- You don't steal Daddy's cars.
- Whose car?!

01:04:36.584 --> 01:04:39.337
- Jesus Christ!
- Fuck!

01:04:39.504 --> 01:04:42.090
- I got your car, Daddy!
- Come here, Chappie!

01:04:42.257 --> 01:04:43.758
- Come here!
- Leave the car.

01:04:43.925 --> 01:04:45.176
Thief! Thief!

01:04:45.343 --> 01:04:47.345
- Come on!
- You thief!

01:04:47.512 --> 01:04:49.097
- Get in.
- But I got the car!

01:04:49.264 --> 01:04:51.433
What's the matter with you?
Shut the door.

01:04:51.599 --> 01:04:52.851
Thief!

01:04:53.435 --> 01:04:56.271
Jesus Christ, Chappie,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

01:04:56.438 --> 01:04:57.605
What, Daddy?

01:04:58.398 --> 01:05:01.234
Daddy needs the cars nice
so he can sell them.

01:05:01.401 --> 01:05:02.819
Why smash the car, man?

01:05:03.361 --> 01:05:06.364
Okay, I see. I see!
Please, may I go again?

01:05:08.158 --> 01:05:09.659
Chappie. That's her.

01:05:09.826 --> 01:05:11.828
That's the slut that took Daddy's car.

01:05:11.995 --> 01:05:13.079
I'm gonna get her.

01:05:14.831 --> 01:05:18.418
- Hi, officer.
- Slut! Get out. Out!

01:05:18.585 --> 01:05:20.795
Why you steal Daddy's cars?
You naughty!

01:05:20.962 --> 01:05:23.631
- It's my car!
- Whose is this? Is this Daddy's?

01:05:24.424 --> 01:05:26.092
Don't steal people's things!

01:05:30.472 --> 01:05:32.182
Hey! Get out, you alcoholic.

01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:34.851
- Out, out, out!
- I haven't been drinking!

01:05:35.018 --> 01:05:37.854
- Are you stealing cars for alcohol?
- That's my car!

01:05:48.531 --> 01:05:49.783
I got my own one, guys.

01:05:49.949 --> 01:05:53.036
That's my boy!
Yo, check this shit out!

01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:56.373
Yeah, I'm a pimp! I'm a pimp!

01:05:58.458 --> 01:06:01.169
Now we're gonna take the cars
to the King.

01:06:01.336 --> 01:06:05.507
And the King's gonna give us
special tools, so we can do the heist!

01:06:05.674 --> 01:06:07.967
Then we'll get even bigger monies,
Chappie.

01:06:09.552 --> 01:06:10.845
I can't do the heist.

01:06:12.097 --> 01:06:13.848
Heist is a crimes.

01:06:40.333 --> 01:06:42.002
Daddy, look. There's dogs here.

01:06:42.168 --> 01:06:44.671
<i>- Ja</i>, Chappie.
- They're here to fight.

01:06:48.675 --> 01:06:50.885
Bring me the ear!

01:06:54.431 --> 01:06:56.057
There's the police!

01:06:56.224 --> 01:06:57.308
Run! It's a cop!

01:06:59.394 --> 01:07:00.895
Hey, he's good!

01:07:01.771 --> 01:07:03.231
He's not a cop!

01:07:09.571 --> 01:07:11.489
Is this where the King lives, Daddy?

01:07:11.656 --> 01:07:14.034
Yeah, you wanna come see
the King with us?

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:17.162
<i>- Ja,</i> I wanna go to the top.
- Well, you can't, Chappie.

01:07:17.328 --> 01:07:19.164
Because you're not doing the heist.

01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:20.749
You stay here.

01:07:20.915 --> 01:07:22.584
Maybe next time, Chappie.

01:07:22.751 --> 01:07:25.628
Okay. I'll just chill here, guys.

01:07:25.795 --> 01:07:28.048
I'll just keep guard here.

01:07:29.382 --> 01:07:31.009
<i>Jissis</i>, it's high.

01:07:48.568 --> 01:07:49.652
Hey, King!

01:07:49.819 --> 01:07:51.154
- My brother.
- My man.

01:07:51.321 --> 01:07:54.324
- What up? What up, man?
- We got all the stuff.

01:07:54.949 --> 01:07:56.159
Parked out back.

01:07:56.326 --> 01:07:57.911
We have the cars?

01:07:58.078 --> 01:07:59.662
From Ninja?

01:07:59.829 --> 01:08:01.748
<i>Yeah, it's all here boss.</i>

01:08:03.875 --> 01:08:05.293
Here's your explosives.

01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:07.295
Hook us up with some more shit.

01:08:07.462 --> 01:08:09.673
We'll take those, <i>nè?</i>
Take them to my car.

01:08:35.615 --> 01:08:37.158
It's dead, Chappie.

01:08:39.077 --> 01:08:41.412
It's gone to the next place, Daddy.

01:08:42.706 --> 01:08:44.666
Out here in the wild...

01:08:46.292 --> 01:08:47.544
...life is hard.

01:08:48.294 --> 01:08:50.462
You see that dog there.

01:08:51.673 --> 01:08:53.049
You're either that dog...

01:08:55.093 --> 01:08:56.261
...or you're this dog.

01:08:56.428 --> 01:08:58.220
If you wanna survive, Chappie...

01:08:58.388 --> 01:09:00.015
...then you must fight.

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:01.558
<i>Ja,</i> but not me.

01:09:01.725 --> 01:09:04.019
I'm titanium.
I'm gonna live forever, Daddy.

01:09:04.185 --> 01:09:05.937
What does that say there?

01:09:07.647 --> 01:09:09.314
"Low battery."

01:09:10.567 --> 01:09:13.569
Battery, power, energy supply.

01:09:14.194 --> 01:09:15.488
I need a new battery.

01:09:15.654 --> 01:09:18.241
That battery's stuck.
It's melted together.

01:09:18.408 --> 01:09:20.952
That battery can't come out.
What you gonna do...

01:09:21.118 --> 01:09:24.581
- ...when that battery runs out?
- I die? Chappie die?

01:09:24.747 --> 01:09:27.542
Deon, he put you in a broken body.

01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:30.211
Deon's my maker.
It doesn't make any sense.

01:09:30.377 --> 01:09:33.715
He wouldn't make me just
so I could die. Deon loves me, Daddy.

01:09:33.881 --> 01:09:35.591
Come here. Come here.

01:09:35.759 --> 01:09:38.928
I can get you a new body,
but it takes lots of monies.

01:09:39.095 --> 01:09:41.930
The type of monies that you get
from doing the heist.

01:09:42.098 --> 01:09:44.434
- I can't do the heist.
- You have to do it.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.103
Now, which dog
do you wanna be, Chappie?

01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:49.606
That dog...

01:09:49.773 --> 01:09:51.358
...or that dog?

01:09:54.652 --> 01:09:56.446
That's my good boy, Chappie.

01:09:56.613 --> 01:09:58.573
It's a good boy. Hey?

01:10:14.214 --> 01:10:16.383
Oh, my God. Again?

01:10:16.549 --> 01:10:20.345
I'm here to collect my creation.
He's too important to leave here.

01:10:20.512 --> 01:10:21.638
He's not here.

01:10:21.805 --> 01:10:23.556
What? Where is he?

01:10:23.723 --> 01:10:27.185
I don't know. He went out with Ninja.
They've been gone all day.

01:10:27.352 --> 01:10:28.645
Doing what?

01:10:29.521 --> 01:10:31.898
Probably committing
an assortment of felonies.

01:10:32.399 --> 01:10:35.402
He's probably a wanted criminal
by this stage.

01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:48.373
Hey, Chappie!

01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:52.043
I brought you a friend for your chicken.
Look at this.

01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:00.677
Hey, Chaps, what are you doing?

01:11:00.844 --> 01:11:02.012
Hey?

01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:11.354
Chappie, why won't you talk to me?

01:11:13.481 --> 01:11:15.233
I'm your maker.

01:11:20.739 --> 01:11:22.282
Come on.

01:11:22.741 --> 01:11:24.659
What do you want, Deon?

01:11:24.826 --> 01:11:27.412
I don't want that bloody chicken.

01:11:27.579 --> 01:11:29.205
Not interested in that shit.

01:11:29.372 --> 01:11:30.665
Oh, really?

01:11:31.916 --> 01:11:34.252
What are you interested in, then,
Chappie?

01:11:36.212 --> 01:11:39.007
Selling narcotics? Being a deadbeat?

01:11:39.174 --> 01:11:40.508
Deon...

01:11:40.675 --> 01:11:43.511
...why are you trying
to control him like this?

01:11:44.012 --> 01:11:45.388
Just let him be.

01:11:45.555 --> 01:11:47.349
Daddy told me about you, Deon...

01:11:47.974 --> 01:11:51.686
...about how you made me
in a body that will die.

01:11:52.937 --> 01:11:54.606
What do you mean, Chappie?

01:11:55.815 --> 01:11:58.443
Is it true that I will die
in a few days, Deon?

01:11:59.819 --> 01:12:02.655
That this battery will die?

01:12:03.323 --> 01:12:04.574
Is it true, Deon?

01:12:06.076 --> 01:12:07.410
Yeah.

01:12:10.413 --> 01:12:12.165
But you my maker.

01:12:13.083 --> 01:12:15.919
Why'd you just make me
so I could die?

01:12:18.505 --> 01:12:19.756
I didn't...

01:12:20.256 --> 01:12:23.009
I didn't make you
so you could die, Chappie.

01:12:23.677 --> 01:12:25.095
I want to live.

01:12:25.261 --> 01:12:27.430
I wanna stay here with Mommy.

01:12:28.223 --> 01:12:29.933
I don't wanna die.

01:12:30.850 --> 01:12:34.979
You've become so much more
than I could ever have imagined.

01:12:38.024 --> 01:12:41.194
How was I supposed to know
that you would become...

01:12:42.237 --> 01:12:43.655
...you?

01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:02.924
Come on, come on. There we go.

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:09.055
Alternate file: Genesis.

01:13:31.995 --> 01:13:33.121
Yes!

01:13:51.723 --> 01:13:54.642
Say goodbye to your daggy,
little monsters, Deon.

01:14:01.191 --> 01:14:02.817
Chappie? Chappie!

01:14:02.984 --> 01:14:04.069
- No!
- Chappie!

01:14:04.235 --> 01:14:06.696
Oh, my God! What's happening?!

01:14:06.863 --> 01:14:08.531
Christ. It's his CPU.

01:14:09.324 --> 01:14:11.076
- Chappie?
- Don't touch him!

01:14:11.242 --> 01:14:12.243
Fuck you, dude!

01:14:12.410 --> 01:14:14.120
- Stand back!
- Okay, okay, okay!

01:14:14.287 --> 01:14:15.830
- Yo, chill. Okay.
- Hey, boss.

01:14:15.997 --> 01:14:17.415
Take it easy, man.

01:14:17.582 --> 01:14:19.125
Step back.

01:14:19.626 --> 01:14:21.795
I'm taking him away from this place!

01:14:27.384 --> 01:14:28.593
Two aces.

01:14:31.012 --> 01:14:32.097
What do you want?

01:14:32.263 --> 01:14:34.307
Hey, man.
You're not gonna believe this.

01:14:34.474 --> 01:14:36.726
<i>The cops have gone offline.</i>

01:14:36.893 --> 01:14:37.894
Are you serious?

01:14:38.061 --> 01:14:39.771
<i>Yeah. It's open season down here.</i>

01:14:39.938 --> 01:14:41.773
No, I got it.

01:14:42.273 --> 01:14:43.316
Hey, <i>thula!</i>

01:14:43.483 --> 01:14:46.736
The robot pigs are offline!

01:14:47.529 --> 01:14:49.864
This city belongs to me!

01:14:51.783 --> 01:14:54.661
I want every-fucking-thing!

01:14:54.828 --> 01:14:56.621
Let's go!

01:15:22.856 --> 01:15:25.400
<i>It's mayhem as police droids
across the metro...</i>

01:15:25.567 --> 01:15:26.985
There it is. There it is.

01:15:27.152 --> 01:15:28.695
<i>...have begun shutting down.</i>

01:15:28.862 --> 01:15:31.531
<i>The R.S.A.P. has not yet issued
a statement...</i>

01:15:31.698 --> 01:15:34.034
<i>...but the city is tearing itself apart.</i>

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:45.670
<i>Return to your homes
or rubber bullets will be used.</i>

01:15:48.923 --> 01:15:50.759
Please disperse!

01:15:53.094 --> 01:15:55.013
Please disperse...

01:16:00.685 --> 01:16:01.936
Come on.

01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:05.190
Yes!

01:16:07.233 --> 01:16:08.943
Burn the dog!

01:16:16.659 --> 01:16:18.912
Get Michelle Bradley
on the line right now!

01:16:19.079 --> 01:16:21.748
Activate every single human officer
and reservist!

01:16:22.749 --> 01:16:24.250
Now! Do it!

01:16:32.842 --> 01:16:36.763
<i>- -with robbers making off
with close to 100 million rand.</i>

01:16:36.930 --> 01:16:40.517
<i>There is no indication the robotic police
will come back online.</i>

01:16:40.684 --> 01:16:43.978
"Are you sure you want
to erase Genesis?" Yes, I would.

01:16:45.397 --> 01:16:49.317
<i>As you can see, there are
broken droids and utter disrepute...</i>

01:17:02.539 --> 01:17:05.291
<i>So far the police have been unable
to investigate...</i>

01:17:05.458 --> 01:17:07.919
<i>...as the rioting continues
unabated in...</i>

01:17:31.234 --> 01:17:32.736
Come on, come on.

01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:53.798
Chappie.

01:17:54.758 --> 01:17:57.177
Chappie. Chappie?

01:17:58.970 --> 01:18:00.597
Come on, Chappie.

01:18:01.806 --> 01:18:03.016
Chappie.

01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:06.061
Chappie.

01:18:06.227 --> 01:18:07.729
<i>Ja,</i> man. Deon, it's me.

01:18:08.605 --> 01:18:10.482
Oh, my God. You're alive.

01:18:13.109 --> 01:18:14.361
What happened to me?

01:18:15.362 --> 01:18:16.821
I'm not sure.

01:18:16.988 --> 01:18:18.865
But I have some suspicions.

01:18:19.741 --> 01:18:22.577
Come on, Chappie. We need
to get out of here. Come on.

01:18:23.244 --> 01:18:26.039
Now, Chappie. Come on. Let's go.

01:18:26.539 --> 01:18:27.957
Where is this? What is it?

01:18:33.797 --> 01:18:34.881
What's this guy?

01:18:35.048 --> 01:18:37.217
A failed version of you. A police robot.

01:18:37.384 --> 01:18:39.052
Come on, let's go!

01:18:40.261 --> 01:18:42.347
What's that? What are these?

01:18:42.514 --> 01:18:45.475
Helmets worn by a human
who controls that horrid thing.

01:18:45.642 --> 01:18:46.685
It reads their mind.

01:18:47.268 --> 01:18:50.313
Doesn't have its own brain, that robot.
Not like you.

01:18:53.983 --> 01:18:56.820
- These can read a brain?
- Yeah, a neural transmitter.

01:18:56.986 --> 01:18:59.072
- Come on!
- But I want to...

01:19:00.699 --> 01:19:02.033
Come on.

01:19:03.576 --> 01:19:05.036
Chappie.

01:19:14.212 --> 01:19:16.423
Deon. Deon.

01:19:17.007 --> 01:19:18.174
This can save me.

01:19:19.384 --> 01:19:22.220
- I need a new bodies, remember?
- No.

01:19:23.304 --> 01:19:24.973
It can't save you, Chappie.

01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:27.684
The problem is much greater
than your battery.

01:19:27.851 --> 01:19:28.852
Why?

01:19:29.019 --> 01:19:31.438
Because you are conscious.

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:34.441
You cannot be copied
because you're not data.

01:19:34.607 --> 01:19:36.901
We don't know what consciousness is...

01:19:37.068 --> 01:19:38.695
...so we cannot move it.

01:19:41.114 --> 01:19:42.907
Chappie can figure it.

01:19:43.074 --> 01:19:45.326
I can know what it is,
then I can move me.

01:19:45.493 --> 01:19:47.078
You can't move it. I'm sorry.

01:19:47.245 --> 01:19:50.165
We need to get out of here.
It's dangerous. Come on!

01:19:50.331 --> 01:19:54.002
You said to me I mustn't let anybody say
that I can't do something.

01:19:54.169 --> 01:19:57.797
Daddy has a man that can get me
the bodies for the monies.

01:19:57.964 --> 01:19:59.632
What? Excuse me?

01:19:59.799 --> 01:20:01.551
Daddy loves me, Deon!

01:20:02.344 --> 01:20:03.470
I hate you!

01:20:03.636 --> 01:20:05.305
I hate you! Go away.

01:20:06.181 --> 01:20:08.058
Have to get my consciousness out.

01:20:08.224 --> 01:20:09.893
Daddy'll get me the bodies...

01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:13.938
...then I have to get my consciousness
out of here and into there.

01:20:14.606 --> 01:20:16.649
- The helmet!
- No. What are you doing?

01:20:16.816 --> 01:20:19.402
- I can use this.
- Put that back. Leave it alone.

01:20:19.569 --> 01:20:22.364
- Put that down. It's illegal!
- I'm gonna take it! No.

01:20:22.530 --> 01:20:25.325
- Chappie. Chappie, wait!
- I'm taking it!

01:20:25.492 --> 01:20:27.535
- No! Chappie, wait!
- I'm taking it!

01:20:27.702 --> 01:20:28.703
Please!

01:20:29.996 --> 01:20:31.373
Chappie!

01:20:32.457 --> 01:20:33.917
Chappie!

01:20:53.561 --> 01:20:54.562
Damn it.

01:21:03.530 --> 01:21:05.240
Move on in. Check the area.

01:21:05.949 --> 01:21:09.661
Go all the way down.
Make sure we look in every room.

01:21:10.787 --> 01:21:12.038
All the way down.

01:21:12.205 --> 01:21:13.707
Sweep all the way back.

01:21:27.887 --> 01:21:29.931
Chappie! Oh, thank God!

01:21:30.098 --> 01:21:31.516
Chappie, are you okay?

01:21:31.683 --> 01:21:33.101
<i>Ja,</i> Mommy, I'm fine.

01:21:33.268 --> 01:21:34.686
What's that thing?

01:21:34.853 --> 01:21:37.105
It's just a neural helmet, Mommy.

01:21:37.272 --> 01:21:38.273
What?

01:21:50.493 --> 01:21:51.536
Chappie.

01:21:51.703 --> 01:21:53.038
What are you doing?

01:21:53.204 --> 01:21:56.541
- I'm doing experiment, Mommy.
- What's all this stuff?

01:21:57.292 --> 01:21:58.793
What's this thing?

01:22:01.379 --> 01:22:03.548
I'll show you. Sit down.

01:22:03.715 --> 01:22:04.883
Okay.

01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:06.217
- Sit.
- Okay.

01:22:06.384 --> 01:22:07.510
Okay, Mommy.

01:22:07.677 --> 01:22:09.262
- Is it gonna hurt?
- No.

01:22:09.429 --> 01:22:12.307
- Okay.
- Okay. Putting it on.

01:22:12.474 --> 01:22:13.683
Okay.

01:22:16.478 --> 01:22:18.104
Okay. Now what?

01:22:18.271 --> 01:22:19.773
Consciousness is like energy.

01:22:19.939 --> 01:22:22.525
This helmet reads the energy
from you and me.

01:22:22.692 --> 01:22:24.694
I need to figure out
how to get it out.

01:22:24.861 --> 01:22:28.365
All the information I need
to help me is on the Internet.

01:22:31.743 --> 01:22:32.869
<i>There's books...</i>

01:22:33.036 --> 01:22:35.080
...mathematical equations,
schematics...

01:22:35.246 --> 01:22:38.875
...all the information that human beings
have ever had, all here.

01:22:39.042 --> 01:22:40.877
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Deon!

01:22:41.044 --> 01:22:42.045
Hello.

01:22:42.212 --> 01:22:45.840
Get to your goddamn desk
and figure out what the hell is going on.

01:22:46.007 --> 01:22:47.258
Yes, ma'am.

01:22:48.259 --> 01:22:51.262
Listen. There'll be 300 homicides
in the city tonight...

01:22:51.429 --> 01:22:53.723
...unless your faulty droids
go back online.

01:22:53.890 --> 01:22:56.393
Get me?
This whole company could go under.

01:22:58.478 --> 01:23:00.772
Good work, people.

01:23:00.939 --> 01:23:03.066
Little snafu.
We're taking care of this.

01:23:03.233 --> 01:23:05.610
The Scout model has failed.
Send the Moose in.

01:23:05.777 --> 01:23:08.279
- Show people what it can do.
- Not now, Vincent.

01:23:08.446 --> 01:23:10.115
The city's tearing itself apart.

01:23:10.281 --> 01:23:13.034
Whole thing's going tits up.
We have to take control.

01:23:13.201 --> 01:23:16.413
I said, no. And that's the end of it.

01:23:17.038 --> 01:23:20.291
Hello, gentlemen.
I know, it's been a tough night.

01:23:23.670 --> 01:23:25.130
Daddy get me a new bodies.

01:23:25.296 --> 01:23:29.592
Daddy's gonna get new bodies,
and I just have to get this out.

01:23:29.759 --> 01:23:31.803
I have to get my consciousness out.

01:24:21.644 --> 01:24:22.937
That's it.

01:24:26.983 --> 01:24:28.109
That's me.

01:24:37.952 --> 01:24:40.330
It's time to pump up the jam.

01:24:42.415 --> 01:24:44.834
I know what consciousness is.

01:24:45.418 --> 01:24:46.503
That's nice.

01:24:46.670 --> 01:24:48.380
This helmet can read it.

01:24:49.798 --> 01:24:53.301
All I need is monies from the heist
for my new body.

01:24:53.468 --> 01:24:55.387
That's right, motherfucker.

01:24:55.553 --> 01:24:56.721
Come.

01:24:57.972 --> 01:25:00.475
- Let's go.
- I solved it, Daddy.

01:25:39.639 --> 01:25:40.640
Go!

01:25:43.685 --> 01:25:46.354
- I see one!
- These guys need to sleep, Chappie.

01:25:46.521 --> 01:25:47.856
Sleep, guy!

01:25:48.523 --> 01:25:50.025
Here comes the boom!

01:25:50.734 --> 01:25:52.193
Hit it, hit it, hit it!

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.946
- Go, Chappie. Go!
- Get the money! Get the money!

01:25:55.613 --> 01:25:57.657
- You, out!
- Make him sleep, Chappie!

01:25:57.824 --> 01:26:00.827
- Make him sleep!
- Good night! Sleep!

01:26:01.786 --> 01:26:03.872
- You go sleepy-weepy.
- Get in, Chappie.

01:26:04.039 --> 01:26:05.373
Come on, Chappie!

01:26:32.776 --> 01:26:34.611
Do you realize what you've done?

01:26:38.490 --> 01:26:39.491
<i>Good God.</i>

01:26:39.657 --> 01:26:42.494
<i>If I'm seeing these images correctly...</i>

01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:46.414
<i>...it looks like the police droids have
now begun helping the criminals.</i>

01:26:46.581 --> 01:26:48.667
- Chappie.
- <i>We are trying to contact...</i>

01:26:48.833 --> 01:26:51.419
- Got the second one!
- There's one more. Get it.

01:26:51.586 --> 01:26:53.505
- Good, Chappie, good.
- You can sleep.

01:26:53.672 --> 01:26:56.174
- You can sleep.
- Come on, Chappie. Go, go, go!

01:26:56.341 --> 01:26:59.886
<i>Three suspects are robbing an
armored car with what appears to be...</i>

01:27:00.053 --> 01:27:03.056
<i>- ...the help of a Scout police robot.</i>
- Oh, no.

01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:08.353
You will not get away with this.
Everyone will know!

01:27:13.775 --> 01:27:16.736
Let's go! Let's go! That's three.
Chappie, let's go!

01:27:17.946 --> 01:27:19.447
Please.

01:27:19.614 --> 01:27:22.534
- Chappie, what are you doing?
- What's the matter?

01:27:22.701 --> 01:27:24.536
Ninja, grab the bag. Let's go!

01:27:26.246 --> 01:27:27.914
Are you sleepy?

01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:29.958
Chappie, come on!

01:27:30.125 --> 01:27:32.877
- Please don't hurt me.
- Chappie, get in the van!

01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:35.005
- Chappie!
- Let's go.

01:27:35.171 --> 01:27:36.506
You can sleep now.

01:27:37.007 --> 01:27:38.633
You can sleep.

01:27:40.176 --> 01:27:41.761
Please let me live.

01:27:44.055 --> 01:27:46.016
Chappie!

01:27:46.683 --> 01:27:47.684
I'm sorry.

01:27:49.519 --> 01:27:52.480
Come on! Come on, boy! Let's get in.

01:27:54.232 --> 01:27:56.067
I thought you were gonna sleep!

01:27:56.943 --> 01:27:58.737
Can I talk to you in private?

01:28:00.572 --> 01:28:02.866
Could you give us a moment, please?

01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:06.911
Thank you.

01:28:08.663 --> 01:28:11.624
Oh, God.
This is certainly a fuck-up.

01:28:11.791 --> 01:28:14.336
Ma'am, listen.
This is the work of Deon.

01:28:14.502 --> 01:28:17.672
It's the work of some rogue program
that he's been writing...

01:28:17.839 --> 01:28:20.675
...and last night
he brought a droid in here...

01:28:20.842 --> 01:28:22.218
...and it was sentient.

01:28:24.971 --> 01:28:26.973
And have you seen this?
Do you know?

01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:30.018
It's committing crimes, the monster.
Look at that.

01:28:30.185 --> 01:28:32.687
<i>The Scout model
is nearly indestructible.</i>

01:28:33.271 --> 01:28:34.522
I told him no!

01:28:34.689 --> 01:28:38.151
Okay. That's a lot worse
than just failing to work.

01:28:38.318 --> 01:28:42.447
So let's use this situation
to make a certain other robot shine.

01:28:42.614 --> 01:28:44.532
This thing has gotta be destroyed...

01:28:44.699 --> 01:28:47.619
...crushed before it does
any more damage, and Deon...

01:28:47.786 --> 01:28:49.120
Deon's gotta be removed.

01:28:49.579 --> 01:28:52.457
He has cost this company dearly.
And your reputation.

01:28:52.624 --> 01:28:55.251
You do not want this
to be your legacy.

01:28:59.214 --> 01:29:00.924
Do it.

01:29:01.091 --> 01:29:03.718
- Destroy that robot.
- Thank you, ma'am.

01:29:03.885 --> 01:29:06.179
- Burn it to ash.
- Thank you.

01:29:07.764 --> 01:29:08.932
People...

01:29:09.099 --> 01:29:10.975
...this is Michelle Bradley.

01:29:11.142 --> 01:29:13.645
<i>I authorize the launch of the Moose.</i>

01:29:13.812 --> 01:29:17.107
<i>Repeat: I authorize the launch
of the Moose.</i>

01:29:18.066 --> 01:29:19.984
Move it out! Clear the deck!

01:29:20.610 --> 01:29:22.946
Move it out! Let's move!
Move! Now!

01:29:23.113 --> 01:29:26.366
<i>Moose launch
in T-minus five minutes.</i>

01:29:49.264 --> 01:29:51.016
Come on, get out of here.

01:29:55.061 --> 01:29:56.438
You motherfucker.

01:29:57.188 --> 01:29:59.232
I want that robot.

01:29:59.983 --> 01:30:01.026
Go!

01:30:01.192 --> 01:30:03.236
Everyone out! Go!
Move! Move! Move!

01:30:03.403 --> 01:30:04.904
Go! Go! Go!

01:30:34.934 --> 01:30:36.102
Let's go!

01:30:48.782 --> 01:30:50.658
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfuckers!

01:30:50.825 --> 01:30:52.660
I'm going home! I'm going home!

01:30:52.827 --> 01:30:54.829
Daddy, can we go
and get my new body...

01:30:54.996 --> 01:30:57.123
...from your friend with the fresh one?

01:30:57.290 --> 01:30:58.291
Daddy, we go now?

01:30:58.458 --> 01:31:02.170
I'm sorry, man,
but there is no new bodies.

01:31:02.337 --> 01:31:04.130
I'm sorry, Chappie. I swear.

01:31:04.297 --> 01:31:07.926
What do you mean, no new bodies?
Daddy, we've got the monies.

01:31:08.093 --> 01:31:09.969
I needed your help with the heist.

01:31:10.929 --> 01:31:12.597
You lied to me.

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:14.808
You lied to me, Daddy!

01:31:14.974 --> 01:31:18.478
Just relax, Chappie. At the time
you were different and, like....

01:31:20.230 --> 01:31:21.439
You lied to me, Daddy!

01:31:21.606 --> 01:31:23.108
- Chappie.
- You lied!

01:31:23.274 --> 01:31:25.777
- Why you lie to me?! Why?!
- No! Stop, Chappie!

01:31:34.494 --> 01:31:36.121
I'm coming to get you, Deon.

01:31:38.373 --> 01:31:41.251
Come on. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on!

01:31:49.634 --> 01:31:52.137
- Why, Daddy?!
- No, Chappie! Chappie, stop it!

01:31:52.303 --> 01:31:54.764
Leave me, Amerika! You lied to me!

01:31:54.931 --> 01:31:56.307
- Chappie!
- Chappie, no!

01:31:56.474 --> 01:31:58.601
- No, Chappie! No!
- You lie, Daddy!

01:31:58.768 --> 01:32:01.021
You were gonna let me die, Daddy!

01:32:01.187 --> 01:32:03.023
You were gonna let me die!

01:32:03.648 --> 01:32:05.316
Why you humans do this?!

01:32:05.483 --> 01:32:06.776
Why you all lie?!

01:32:06.943 --> 01:32:09.946
We can find a way, Chappie.
I'm sorry, my boy.

01:32:10.113 --> 01:32:11.239
I swear, I'm sorry.

01:32:11.406 --> 01:32:13.408
Chappie, listen,
I know how you feel...

01:32:13.575 --> 01:32:16.995
...but there's something headed
our way now, coming to hurt you.

01:32:17.162 --> 01:32:18.663
- What?
- No time to explain.

01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:22.834
When this thing gets here, it'll stop
at nothing until you're gone, Chappie.

01:32:23.001 --> 01:32:24.419
What are you talking about?

01:32:29.549 --> 01:32:31.926
No. No, Deon.

01:32:34.888 --> 01:32:38.266
I'm going anyways.
My battery's gonna finish.

01:32:38.433 --> 01:32:40.685
No, Chappie! No!

01:32:41.186 --> 01:32:43.396
We'll find a way, Chappie.

01:32:43.563 --> 01:32:44.731
I'm going, Mommy.

01:32:48.068 --> 01:32:49.819
Get back! Back up, back up!

01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:52.155
Yeah, man!

01:32:53.448 --> 01:32:54.449
I'm here...

01:32:55.617 --> 01:32:58.078
...for my fucking money, Ninja!

01:32:58.244 --> 01:33:00.080
I don't just want my 20 million.

01:33:00.246 --> 01:33:01.414
He's here to kill us.

01:33:01.873 --> 01:33:03.458
I want your robot.

01:33:03.625 --> 01:33:04.918
I want everything!

01:33:05.085 --> 01:33:06.086
Fuck this shit!

01:33:18.014 --> 01:33:19.307
Chappie, do something!

01:33:25.689 --> 01:33:27.649
Chappie, help us!

01:34:09.691 --> 01:34:11.985
That just tickles, boys.
That just tickles.

01:34:17.115 --> 01:34:19.617
Amerika!

01:34:31.338 --> 01:34:32.714
Come on, little gangster.

01:34:40.638 --> 01:34:41.639
That's it.

01:34:42.515 --> 01:34:43.767
That's my money!

01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:52.567
Yep. Fly up, fly up, fly up.

01:34:55.528 --> 01:34:56.780
No! Stop!

01:35:00.867 --> 01:35:02.577
- Come on!
- My bag! My bag!

01:35:02.744 --> 01:35:06.831
I'm gonna finish you off.
Every single pathetic scum lot of you.

01:35:16.007 --> 01:35:17.008
Ninja!

01:35:17.884 --> 01:35:18.885
Fuck!

01:35:19.052 --> 01:35:21.680
Jesus, dude! Get out of way!

01:35:21.846 --> 01:35:23.848
How about a cluster bomb?

01:35:31.022 --> 01:35:32.982
Move out of the way!

01:35:47.914 --> 01:35:49.416
This is too good.

01:35:54.254 --> 01:35:55.255
Here we go.

01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:05.223
No!

01:36:26.578 --> 01:36:27.579
Fuck mother!

01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:31.958
Bugger!

01:36:33.084 --> 01:36:35.211
You! I'm gonna kill you!

01:36:39.174 --> 01:36:40.175
Hey, hey, hey!

01:36:50.477 --> 01:36:51.519
Chappie!

01:37:02.655 --> 01:37:04.532
Let's go! Let's go!

01:37:06.117 --> 01:37:07.535
No, Mommy!

01:37:11.748 --> 01:37:12.749
Inside, Mommy!

01:37:15.919 --> 01:37:17.420
What's going on? I can't see.

01:37:24.135 --> 01:37:25.804
Get in the car, maker!

01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:27.138
Hey, hey, hey!

01:37:27.305 --> 01:37:28.473
Hey, <i>baba</i>.

01:37:30.892 --> 01:37:32.352
I want that truck!

01:37:33.687 --> 01:37:36.106
Hey, hey! Get out! Out!

01:37:37.273 --> 01:37:39.317
Run, Deon, go!

01:38:02.757 --> 01:38:04.217
Chappie!

01:38:06.261 --> 01:38:09.180
No! Maker! Maker!

01:38:12.017 --> 01:38:13.268
It's okay.

01:38:16.354 --> 01:38:17.981
Go, go, go! Come on!

01:38:18.148 --> 01:38:20.275
Backup visuals. Infrared.

01:38:21.776 --> 01:38:25.196
You'll be okay. I've solved it!
We'll get your consciousness out.

01:38:26.823 --> 01:38:27.991
Yo-Landi!

01:38:36.332 --> 01:38:38.168
Stop here, Daddy! Stop!

01:38:38.835 --> 01:38:41.338
- What are you doing?
- Getting the neural helmet!

01:38:41.755 --> 01:38:43.381
I'm coming for you now, mate.

01:39:01.691 --> 01:39:04.277
My helmet. My helmet.

01:39:05.737 --> 01:39:08.323
Ninja. Ninja.

01:39:09.449 --> 01:39:10.867
Ninja, get back! Get back!

01:39:11.034 --> 01:39:14.120
I have to get my maker
to that other helmet at the factory!

01:39:14.287 --> 01:39:15.538
My helmet's broken!

01:39:15.705 --> 01:39:18.583
I'm gonna draw this thing away from us.
Okay. Take her!

01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:21.294
- No! No, Ninja!
- Go, Chappie!

01:39:21.461 --> 01:39:23.296
- Go!
- Ninja, don't leave me!

01:39:24.464 --> 01:39:26.633
- Ninja!
- Hey!

01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:28.343
Hey, <i>poes!</i>

01:39:34.641 --> 01:39:36.309
Who's that?

01:39:36.810 --> 01:39:38.812
Oh, my gosh, look at you.

01:39:38.978 --> 01:39:40.480
You think you're a hero.

01:40:03.628 --> 01:40:04.879
- Ninja!
- No, Mommy!

01:40:05.046 --> 01:40:07.007
What you doing? What you doing?!

01:40:07.173 --> 01:40:10.260
Come on! Come! Come on, do it!

01:40:13.722 --> 01:40:14.764
Come on!

01:40:16.641 --> 01:40:18.518
Do it!

01:40:24.858 --> 01:40:26.026
Do it!

01:40:26.192 --> 01:40:28.862
Do it!

01:40:53.470 --> 01:40:55.305
No, Mommy! Mommy!

01:40:55.472 --> 01:40:56.765
Mommy, please.

01:40:56.931 --> 01:40:58.058
Please, Mommy.

01:41:00.852 --> 01:41:02.437
This is your day of reckoning.

01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:23.124
What the hell's going on?

01:41:24.793 --> 01:41:26.211
Come back. Come back.

01:41:28.088 --> 01:41:29.464
No, no, no. Impossible.

01:41:45.689 --> 01:41:48.358
Wake up, Mommy! Mommy, please!

01:41:57.867 --> 01:41:59.119
Mommy?

01:42:07.252 --> 01:42:08.670
Come here.

01:42:24.769 --> 01:42:27.522
Maker! Maker, who did this to Mommy?

01:42:28.064 --> 01:42:29.274
I know who.

01:42:29.441 --> 01:42:32.610
I hate him! Why?!
Why do they do the hurtings?!

01:42:33.194 --> 01:42:34.654
I'm gonna crush him!

01:42:34.821 --> 01:42:37.866
Daddy, stay there!
Chappie's gonna crush the man!

01:42:58.928 --> 01:42:59.929
Chappie.

01:43:13.026 --> 01:43:14.235
You!

01:43:14.819 --> 01:43:16.112
The man from the van!

01:43:19.616 --> 01:43:22.827
Wait here. I'm gonna get
the bad man from the van!

01:43:31.336 --> 01:43:33.546
You godless freak! Godless!

01:43:36.925 --> 01:43:38.551
You killed Mommy!

01:43:38.718 --> 01:43:40.428
You hurt my peoples! Why?!

01:43:42.681 --> 01:43:45.058
No. You don't use guns.

01:43:50.105 --> 01:43:51.981
I'm gonna crush you, bad man!

01:43:52.148 --> 01:43:55.360
I'm gonna crush you
for hurting my mommy!

01:44:02.033 --> 01:44:03.576
No shooting with the arm.

01:44:06.705 --> 01:44:07.747
No hurtings!

01:44:07.914 --> 01:44:10.291
No violence!

01:44:15.130 --> 01:44:17.257
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

01:44:21.428 --> 01:44:23.930
You are a very bad man.

01:44:32.564 --> 01:44:35.400
Now I forgive you, bad man.

01:44:53.835 --> 01:44:55.086
You're gonna be okay.

01:44:55.253 --> 01:44:56.379
Wait.

01:45:03.261 --> 01:45:04.888
Don't go to sleep, Deon.

01:45:05.055 --> 01:45:06.556
Don't go to the next place.

01:45:06.723 --> 01:45:08.058
Get in the chair.

01:45:08.224 --> 01:45:09.559
Please, quickly.

01:45:13.188 --> 01:45:14.189
Chappie.

01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:18.360
<i>Ja</i>, what?

01:45:20.028 --> 01:45:22.072
There's a problem. Look.

01:45:22.530 --> 01:45:25.200
- There's only one droid.
- Let me get your new body.

01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:29.079
For chrissake, Chappie,
just save yourself.

01:45:44.928 --> 01:45:46.471
No, no, no. Maker.

01:45:47.722 --> 01:45:49.641
Maker, you're gonna be okay.

01:45:49.808 --> 01:45:51.518
You have to be tough.

01:45:51.685 --> 01:45:52.936
You be tough.

01:45:58.024 --> 01:46:00.360
It's gonna be okay.
Stay with me, Deon.

01:46:01.778 --> 01:46:03.488
The police are here now.

01:46:06.074 --> 01:46:07.075
Okay, you ready?

01:46:18.837 --> 01:46:19.879
Please work.

01:46:21.339 --> 01:46:22.590
Get it open. Come on.

01:46:35.770 --> 01:46:39.691
Maker, please take it slow. This will be
very disorientating for a human.

01:46:43.069 --> 01:46:45.613
My God. I'm....

01:46:46.948 --> 01:46:48.199
This isn't working.

01:46:48.366 --> 01:46:50.744
Do you have an angle grinder
or something?

01:46:50.910 --> 01:46:52.746
Are you okay, maker?

01:46:59.627 --> 01:47:01.796
Maker? Do you have pain?

01:47:03.465 --> 01:47:06.509
No, Chappie. I'm... I'm alive.

01:47:13.391 --> 01:47:14.893
I don't know what this means.

01:47:15.602 --> 01:47:17.062
You will live forever.

01:47:22.233 --> 01:47:25.070
Chappie. We have to help you now.

01:47:25.236 --> 01:47:27.113
Think, damn it. Think.

01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:29.574
It's okay, maker. You got saved.

01:47:30.450 --> 01:47:32.494
And there's no more bodies.

01:47:35.163 --> 01:47:37.374
No, Chappie. Wait. I know!

01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:39.501
Vincent uploaded his program here.

01:47:39.668 --> 01:47:42.754
There are hundreds of bodies
all over the city. Here it is!

01:47:45.757 --> 01:47:47.217
Hurry! Plug that in.

01:47:50.095 --> 01:47:52.847
Vincent set up a way
to remotely deactivate droids.

01:47:53.014 --> 01:47:55.266
We can use it
to move you to a new body.

01:47:55.433 --> 01:47:57.811
- Find the closest Scout. Quickly!
- Okay! Okay!

01:47:57.977 --> 01:47:59.396
I'm going quickly!

01:48:00.730 --> 01:48:01.815
I can do it.

01:48:06.486 --> 01:48:08.154
- Deon.
- Yes.

01:48:08.321 --> 01:48:11.116
- Press "Enter" when I say.
- Okay. Okay.

01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:18.873
Come on, Chappie.

01:48:20.625 --> 01:48:21.668
Maker.

01:48:25.338 --> 01:48:27.757
I'm scared. What if it doesn't work?

01:48:29.092 --> 01:48:30.885
It's going to work, Chappie.

01:48:31.052 --> 01:48:34.180
- I promise.
- And you can never break a promise.

01:48:34.347 --> 01:48:36.558
- Come on. Let's do this.
- Okay.

01:48:36.725 --> 01:48:37.809
Okay.

01:48:39.019 --> 01:48:40.103
Here goes.

01:48:41.771 --> 01:48:43.398
Chappie goes in the new body.

01:49:08.298 --> 01:49:11.217
Let's go, boys! Tetravaal, stay back!
Now, boys, go!

01:49:41.748 --> 01:49:43.208
Chappie?

01:49:44.959 --> 01:49:46.002
Is that you?

01:49:46.169 --> 01:49:47.420
<i>Ja</i>, it's me.

01:49:47.587 --> 01:49:48.922
It worked.

01:49:49.089 --> 01:49:50.965
We both have new bodies now.

01:49:51.549 --> 01:49:52.926
Thank you.

01:49:53.885 --> 01:49:56.304
I'm sorry you had
to leave your other body.

01:49:56.471 --> 01:49:58.390
But it was the only way to save you.

01:49:59.432 --> 01:50:00.892
Come, maker. Come quickly.

01:50:01.643 --> 01:50:03.436
We're going back home!

01:50:38.596 --> 01:50:41.307
<i>- Okay, Mommy? Think of something.
- Okay, thinking.</i>

01:50:44.519 --> 01:50:45.520
Is it Daddy?

01:50:46.104 --> 01:50:47.313
Yeah.

01:50:48.231 --> 01:50:49.733
It's working, Mommy.

01:50:49.899 --> 01:50:51.192
It's working!

01:51:29.064 --> 01:51:31.316
It's just a temporary body, Mommy.

01:51:31.983 --> 01:51:33.777
I'll make you a new one.

01:51:33.943 --> 01:51:36.696
You don't have to go
to the next place.

01:51:41.201 --> 01:51:44.120
<i>South African authorities
placed an immediate halt...</i>

01:51:44.287 --> 01:51:47.582
<i>...on the use of any robotic element
of law enforcement...</i>

01:51:47.749 --> 01:51:53.463
<i>...and have activated
150,000 reserve human forces.</i>

01:51:53.630 --> 01:51:56.383
<i>In Johannesburg,
there have been several sightings...</i>

01:51:56.549 --> 01:51:59.260
<i>...of the presumed deactivated robot,
Chappie.</i>

01:51:59.427 --> 01:52:02.013
<i>The police ask viewers
who have seen Chappie...</i>

01:52:02.180 --> 01:52:03.598
<i>...to please come forward.</i>

01:52:03.765 --> 01:52:06.017
<i>We'll have more on this
as it develops.</i>

01:52:39.092 --> 01:52:41.052
I'll see you soon, Mommy.

01:52:57.610 --> 01:52:59.830
Now we are both black sheeps,
Mommy.
