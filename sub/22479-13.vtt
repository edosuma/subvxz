It's a murder.

Provenza: Jim Bechtel's
daughter, Tammy,

00:08.791 --> 00:10.227
has flown in from Charlotte.

00:10.271 --> 00:13.013
I expect her here any minute,

00:13.056 --> 00:15.232
We were only a serious part of
his life for a few years,

00:15.276 --> 00:16.712
and that was decades ago.

00:16.755 --> 00:18.279
Did you ever see
Phillip again?
No.

a special assignment for you.

00:20.107 --> 00:21.543
It could be a little risky.

00:21.586 --> 00:23.545
Maybe Stroh is focused

00:23.588 --> 00:26.156
on all of his mother's
joint checking accounts

00:26.200 --> 00:27.940
that were closed
by Hunt Sanford.

00:27.984 --> 00:29.333
We can get the money out

00:29.377 --> 00:31.118

business accounts...

00:31.161 --> 00:32.510
You said you could
hack anything.

00:32.554 --> 00:33.859
I did not say that.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.513
I told you I could grab
individual computers

00:35.557 --> 00:37.559

00:37.602 --> 00:40.475
He has an hour appointment

Tammy Bechtel
was not on the list

of any of the people
Phillip Stroh was searching for.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.507
Yeah, I-I want to
ask her a question

02:39.550 --> 02:40.943
about her father's estate,

answering her cell.

02:44.120 --> 02:46.383
W-Well, maybe
she's still grieving.

02:46.427 --> 02:49.473
Maybe you should take whatever
question you have about her

02:49.517 --> 02:51.083
to the lieutenant
and let him decide if he's --

02:51.127 --> 02:52.346
I'm not playing detective,
Gus.

02:52.389 --> 02:53.782
Well, then --
then, what's the deal?

02:53.825 --> 02:56.001
Instead of letting Stroh
scare me out of my mind,

02:56.045 --> 02:58.003
I am trying to
think like him

02:58.047 --> 03:00.005
so I can determine
what he's gonna do next.

03:00.049 --> 03:02.704
-I wonder about that.
-Oh, my God!

03:02.747 --> 03:04.880
Wes!
Why are you here?

03:04.923 --> 03:07.143
Because this place
is no longer safe.

03:08.753 --> 03:10.407
Nolan:
I drove up to San Jose

03:10.451 --> 03:13.105
and grabbed Ricky Rater's keys
from the valet stand.

03:13.149 --> 03:15.238
I need to send them back
with an apology.

03:15.282 --> 03:18.850
Then I rented a fake L.A.P.D.
uniform from Western Costume,

03:18.894 --> 03:22.245
doctored it up to look real,
and used it to pass by S.I.S.

03:22.289 --> 03:23.899
Oh, my God,
and the kid would've been dead.

03:23.942 --> 03:26.118
Fritz, your people were supposed
to have this covered.

03:26.162 --> 03:29.252
Well, they had eyes out for
Stroh, not a patrol officer.

03:29.296 --> 03:33.125
But Nolan did prove
that the condo isn't safe,

03:33.169 --> 03:34.823
which is
what I asked him to do.

03:34.866 --> 03:37.434
Thank you, Wes.
And, Chief Howard,

03:37.478 --> 03:40.785
would you please release
the boy's security detail?

03:40.829 --> 03:43.005
From now on,
where I go, they go,

03:43.048 --> 03:45.486
and I'm not leaving here
until Stroh is dead.

03:45.529 --> 03:47.314
No, wait,
but he's not --

03:47.357 --> 03:49.664
Look, I-I don't care
what the sign said

03:49.707 --> 03:52.232
in the doctor's office.
Stroh is not coming after me.

03:52.275 --> 03:54.538
You think if Stroh saw
an opportunity to kill you,

03:54.582 --> 03:56.540
he wouldn't take it?

03:56.584 --> 03:58.803
I'm not his objective.

03:58.847 --> 04:01.197
Well,
I tend to agree with you.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.287
Obviously, Stroh is
after his mother's money.

04:04.331 --> 04:07.290
But we still don't know where
Stroh is or his accomplice.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.031
Look, he may be
using you as a decoy,

04:09.074 --> 04:10.293
but I agree
with the lieutenant.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.642
Both of you
are safer with him

04:11.686 --> 04:13.949
until Stroh is either dead
or in custody.

04:13.992 --> 04:15.298
And now we might know

04:15.342 --> 04:17.213
how he's getting around the city
unnoticed.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.303
Sanchez: The drive falls inside
the timeframe of our murders.

04:20.347 --> 04:22.349
That's the best you can do
on the plates?

04:22.392 --> 04:23.872
Sorry. Unfortunately,
Stroh wasn't

04:23.915 --> 04:25.265
driving down the street
sideways.

04:25.308 --> 04:26.788
Sanchez:
Well, if this is Stroh, Chief,

04:26.831 --> 04:28.833
the motorcycle and the helmet
could be useful.

04:28.877 --> 04:31.009
The make and model
are fairly common.

04:31.053 --> 04:33.098
Neither the helmet or the color
are that distinctive.

04:33.142 --> 04:36.624
Provenza:
But it would be great to release
this photo to the press,

04:36.667 --> 04:38.495
along with mug shots of Stroh

04:38.539 --> 04:41.585
and the Interpol photo
we have of Dylan Baxter.

04:41.629 --> 04:42.978
We could start blowing up

04:43.021 --> 04:45.110
the fake tip line folder
we created as bait

04:45.154 --> 04:46.808
and maybe convince the hacker
to open it.

04:46.851 --> 04:48.853
Excuse me one second,
Buzz.

04:51.813 --> 04:53.945
I just executed
a back-end subroutine,

04:53.989 --> 04:57.819
meaning that the tip line folder
is set to go live from my phone

04:57.862 --> 04:59.386
to the murder board monitor

04:59.429 --> 05:01.779
where it will make for
a better bait.

05:01.823 --> 05:03.999
What happens when
Dylan opens the tip folder?

05:04.042 --> 05:06.088
We'll gum up his connections
to the Internet

05:06.131 --> 05:08.525
while he nail down
his exact physical location.

05:08.569 --> 05:10.788
But he has to
click on the folder.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.137
Rule number one in cyber --

05:12.181 --> 05:13.791
do not click on
random attachments.

-It won't appear random, boss.

very impulsive.

05:21.712 --> 05:24.715
Or given how dangerous
these guys are, Chief,

05:24.759 --> 05:27.849

what's your alternative?

This is Rusty Beck again.

Uh, if you could give me a call
back on this number,

09:56.421 --> 09:58.119

Thank you.

09:58.162 --> 09:59.642
I just don't see

10:02.689 --> 10:04.821
Stroh took a big risk in
murdering her father.

10:04.865 --> 10:07.824
Why?

10:07.868 --> 10:11.436
There has to be
something that Stroh needed

10:11.480 --> 10:14.352
that only Mr. Bechtel had.

10:14.396 --> 10:17.138
It does sound like
you really know Stroh.

10:17.181 --> 10:18.922
Yeah.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.621
And he knows me.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.799
He knows me very well.

10:25.842 --> 10:28.149
Stroh: I don't want to
use the word "whore,"

10:28.192 --> 10:31.108
'cause I know you think of Ella
as your fiancée.

10:31.152 --> 10:32.849

10:41.553 --> 10:45.383

$50,000, enough to escape?

21:03.697 --> 21:07.178

the folder marked "Travel."

21:07.222 --> 21:08.441
Here it is!

21:08.484 --> 21:10.660
Goodbye, and good luck.

21:13.141 --> 21:14.882
Oh, my gosh.

21:14.925 --> 21:17.493
There's gigabytes of data here,
all these different files.

21:17.537 --> 21:20.975
"Miscellaneous," "Business,"
"Supplies," "Conversations."

21:21.018 --> 21:22.498
There, there.
"Travel."

21:27.634 --> 21:29.462
It's a reservation
for a private jet

21:29.505 --> 21:31.681
departing at 3:00 P.M.
this afternoon.

21:31.725 --> 21:33.596
That's less than
two hours from now.

21:33.640 --> 21:37.121
I am redeploying your team
and S.O.B. to that airport.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.907
Surround it, lock it down,
search it.

21:39.950 --> 21:41.778
Yes, Chief Howard?

21:41.822 --> 21:44.259
Provenza. Behind you.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.261
Flynn, no, no, no,
you're not going anywhere.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.308
You want Stroh captured, or do
you want this done by any means?

21:49.351 --> 21:51.701
Stroh throws down his weapon,
puts his hands above his head,

21:51.745 --> 21:53.181
the autopsy will show that.

21:53.224 --> 21:55.270

Gwendolyn Strohs,

Yeah, Ms. Bechtel.

Now, why would he write that
with a question mark?

23:59.263 --> 24:00.656
Stroh found his mother.

24:00.700 --> 24:03.180
Could Ms. Bechtel be
Stroh's stepsister Tammy,

24:03.224 --> 24:04.617
Jim Bechtel's daughter?

24:04.660 --> 24:06.532
Well, what interest
would he have in her?

24:06.575 --> 24:08.577
She was married,
but she kept her maiden name,

24:08.621 --> 24:10.710
so that would make her
Ms. Bechtel, right?

24:10.753 --> 24:12.059
And I've been calling her
all day,

24:12.102 --> 24:13.626

Mr. Beck, when I want your
opinion, I'll ask for it.

Lieutenant?
-Yes, right.

Tammy Bechtel
is at her dad's other house

24:21.460 --> 24:24.811

24:29.076 --> 24:30.991
-Nothing so far, Chief,

24:31.034 --> 24:33.080
but if Stroh is here,
he is not getting out.

24:33.123 --> 24:35.517
Why would he be
loading up with supplies

24:38.738 --> 24:40.261
Nothing.

Chief Mason, could you spare
a couple of officers

"just to be on the safe side,"
