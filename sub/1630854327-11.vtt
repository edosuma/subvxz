03:53.612 --> 03:54.717
All right.
Well, this way.

03:54.855 --> 03:56.546
All right.

03:58.203 --> 04:01.413
So we'll see if we can change
that out just a little bit here.

04:01.551 --> 04:04.313
Turn the beds for privacy and--
Oh. Here they are.

04:04.451 --> 04:06.660
Hi!
Good morning, everyone!

04:06.798 --> 04:09.318
Ah.
So, I'm Dr. Miranda Bailey.

04:09.456 --> 04:12.735
And I'm thrilled to welcome you
to Grey-Sloan

04:12.873 --> 04:15.013
as our inaugural class

04:15.151 --> 04:18.603
of out-of-state OB/GYN
reproductive healthcare

04:18.741 --> 04:20.846
and advocacy fellows.

04:20.984 --> 04:25.265
You have traveled from Idaho, Arkansas,

04:25.403 --> 04:28.026
Texas, even Tennessee
to be with us.

04:28.164 --> 04:31.271
And I know you'd rather be
getting this clinical experience

04:31.409 --> 04:33.859
in your own
residency programs,

04:33.997 --> 04:39.417
but we are honored to offer
this rotation in abortion care.

04:39.555 --> 04:42.351
Because how else
are you going to learn, right?

04:42.489 --> 04:45.043
You've all chosen OB/GYN
as your specialty,

04:45.181 --> 04:48.357
and now your respective states
are restricting

04:48.495 --> 04:50.117
how you practice
that specialty.

04:50.255 --> 04:52.706
But we are here to make sure you
get the education that you need.

04:52.844 --> 04:54.673
I'm sorry.
I'm Dr. Addison Montgomery.

04:56.019 --> 04:57.952
And I've been
to some of your states.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.368
I've seen the desperation.

04:59.506 --> 05:02.198
I've seen the pain,
seen the heartbreak.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.649
I've seen lives lost.

05:06.029 --> 05:08.135
So, anyway, who's ready
to get to work?

05:10.793 --> 05:13.416
Come with me.
- This is Dr. Jo Wilson. Hey.

05:13.554 --> 05:15.729
How come we don't get to work
directly with Montgomery?

05:15.867 --> 05:17.351
We did.
We made sex-ed videos.

05:17.489 --> 05:19.422
Yeah, that was before
she was a rock star.

05:19.560 --> 05:21.562
Did you see the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>
story about her?

05:21.700 --> 05:22.977
It's our hospital.
It's not right.

05:23.115 --> 05:24.565
Well, neither is having to go
to another state

05:24.703 --> 05:26.084
to get fully trained
in your specialty.

05:26.222 --> 05:28.224
I'm just saying
we are five feet away.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.640
We could join them.

05:30.778 --> 05:34.092
Jessica Hall, 22.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

05:34.230 --> 05:36.059
Has been waiting for
a bilateral lung transplant

05:36.197 --> 05:37.509
and is here today--

05:40.132 --> 05:42.342
Uh...

05:42.480 --> 05:44.999
Uh, sorry. Um...

05:45.137 --> 05:46.449
Why is she here?
Right.

05:46.587 --> 05:49.418
Uh, she's here today
for a single lung transplant

05:49.556 --> 05:50.867
from a directed donor.

05:51.005 --> 05:52.282
Are you sure she shouldn't
stay on the list,

05:52.421 --> 05:54.388
hold out for two lungs
rather than the one?

05:54.526 --> 05:57.115
She's been on the list
for two years without matching,

05:57.253 --> 05:59.117
and her condition
is worsening.

05:59.255 --> 06:01.015
A single lung
will help prevent her

06:01.153 --> 06:03.121
from deteriorating
into heart failure.

06:03.259 --> 06:05.123
You're just mad
RJ's the match.

06:05.261 --> 06:08.437
My boyfriend offers to save
my life over a Sunday dinner,

06:08.575 --> 06:09.783
and she answers by asking

06:09.921 --> 06:11.716
if he's finally finished
his degree.

06:11.854 --> 06:13.890
We were both
feminist-studies majors.

06:14.028 --> 06:16.203
Men only major in that
to meet women.

06:16.341 --> 06:17.722
Go ahead.

06:17.860 --> 06:19.551
Say it.
I'm a...

06:19.689 --> 06:21.311
You're sexist.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

06:21.450 --> 06:24.073
And if he didn't major in that,
we would've never met,

06:24.211 --> 06:26.109
and I wouldn't be getting
a lung today.

06:26.247 --> 06:28.629
Are you?
Where is he?

06:28.767 --> 06:30.079
Who's late
for surgery?

06:30.217 --> 06:31.736
Surgeons, actually.
It happens all the time.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.256
Uh, maybe not that much.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.741
Well, I'm sure
he'll be here soon.

06:36.879 --> 06:38.121
We're not gonna start
without him.

06:38.259 --> 06:39.260
Well, obviously.

06:40.779 --> 06:42.712
Adams, let us know
when he arrives.

06:46.889 --> 06:49.409
When did we reorganize
our triage orders?

06:49.547 --> 06:51.480
And who categorized
our patients this way?

06:51.618 --> 06:52.964
Yeah.
That might have been me.

06:53.102 --> 06:54.759
I was running the ER last week,
and they weren't quite right

06:54.897 --> 06:56.726
according to how we do it
upstairs in cardio, so...

06:56.864 --> 06:58.901
Oh, did you check and see
if it was quite right

06:59.039 --> 07:00.903
for us down here
in the trauma department?

07:01.041 --> 07:03.181
Okay.
Everyone, listen up.

07:03.319 --> 07:04.562
Just in case there is
any confusion,

07:04.700 --> 07:06.840
I am back
as Chief of Trauma.

07:06.978 --> 07:08.013
Do you want to know
what else is back?

07:08.151 --> 07:09.359
The way I used to do things.

07:09.498 --> 07:11.948
And I want to return
to our old triage protocols

07:12.086 --> 07:14.261
and revert back
to my old filing systems.

07:14.399 --> 07:16.919
Any questions, comments, concerns?

07:17.057 --> 07:19.853
Hey.
Dr. Ndugu bought us lunch
on Fridays.

07:19.991 --> 07:21.164
Will that continue?

07:21.302 --> 07:23.857
Huh! Well...

07:23.995 --> 07:25.375
I'd be happy
to let Dr. Ndugu

07:25.514 --> 07:27.308
continue to buy you all lunch
on Fridays.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.379
Okay. Let's get you into a bed.

07:29.518 --> 07:31.451
And we can go over
your medical history.

07:33.832 --> 07:35.455
Chief Bailey.

07:35.593 --> 07:38.699
Not Chief anymore, Marcus.
Just Doctor.

07:38.837 --> 07:40.529
Either way, we've got
some protesters outside.

07:40.667 --> 07:42.116
They're trying to block
the entrance.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.118
Oh.
Well, there's always a few.

07:44.256 --> 07:45.775
They're usually peaceful.

07:45.913 --> 07:47.156
Define "peaceful."

08:15.633 --> 08:17.566
Millin.
Did you page Ndugu?

08:17.704 --> 08:19.257
I thought you were back
running trauma.

08:19.395 --> 08:21.259
It's a blunt trauma
to the chest.
So I should...

08:21.397 --> 08:24.365
Page cardio, five minutes ago.
Get a chest tray on standby.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.195
Let CT know that we may need to
jump the line.

08:26.333 --> 08:28.093
And let the OR floor know
that we may have a new patient.

08:28.231 --> 08:29.232
Right.
Thank you.

08:29.370 --> 08:31.511
Okay.

08:32.891 --> 08:33.927
What do we got?

08:34.065 --> 08:36.032
Ryan Jenkins, 24, MVC.

08:36.170 --> 08:37.689
Blunt trauma to the chest
and abdomen.

08:37.827 --> 08:38.759
Multiple rib fractures.

08:38.897 --> 08:40.278
Patient's splinting,

08:40.416 --> 08:42.418
and his oxygen saturation's
in the low 90s.

08:42.556 --> 08:45.110
Just--
I just-- just...

08:45.248 --> 08:46.595
It's okay.
Save your strength, okay?

08:46.733 --> 08:48.217
Let's get him inside.
Let's go.

08:51.669 --> 08:54.775
Okay. Marni Young?

08:54.913 --> 08:56.397
You're in
the right place.

08:56.536 --> 09:00.332
And you're here for a...
medical abortion?

09:02.680 --> 09:04.785
H-How many weeks
are you?

09:04.923 --> 09:09.307
Oh. 34 and already
very uncomfortable.

09:09.445 --> 09:11.240
I don't want to think about
how 40 weeks feels.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.036
Okay.
Uh, well, you know,

09:14.174 --> 09:16.417
medical abortions are done
in the first 10 weeks.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.628
And even a surgical abortion is,
um, not gonna happen for you.

09:19.766 --> 09:21.284
No.
No, no, no.

09:21.422 --> 09:22.803
Okay.
It's for me.

09:22.941 --> 09:24.874
I need the abortion.
Six weeks.

09:25.012 --> 09:25.979
Oh, thank God. Oh.

09:26.117 --> 09:27.705
Andra's my support system.

09:27.843 --> 09:30.466
We're best friends.
Born two days apart.

09:30.604 --> 09:31.881
Our mamas met
in Lamaze class.

09:32.019 --> 09:34.125
Now we're both pregnant,
except I don't want to be.

09:34.263 --> 09:35.644
So here we are.

09:35.782 --> 09:37.887
I brought snacks and movies
and card games.

09:38.025 --> 09:40.338
So we're ready. Great.

09:40.476 --> 09:43.065
All right. We're just gonna do
a quick physical exam.

09:43.203 --> 09:45.239
And then we'll get you
your medication.

09:45.377 --> 09:46.482
Any questions?

09:46.620 --> 09:48.518
Man in distance:
This clinic kills!

09:48.657 --> 09:51.832
Is that gonna go on
all day?

09:51.970 --> 09:53.247
This clinic kills!
This clinic kills!

09:53.385 --> 09:55.353
<i>Hey, Bailey.</i>

09:55.491 --> 09:58.770
Hey. When I call you eight times
in a row, it means pick up.

09:58.908 --> 10:01.946
Sorry. Richard and I are trying
to fix a budget situation.

10:02.084 --> 10:03.775
Well, help me
with my situation first.

10:03.913 --> 10:05.777
Here.
- We have picketers.
<i>How many?</i>

10:05.915 --> 10:08.538
A lot, and it's my fault.
Uh, they're here for me.

10:08.677 --> 10:10.368
I don't know
how they figured out where I am.

10:10.506 --> 10:12.922
I had to change planes twice.
I didn't take the PRT.

10:13.060 --> 10:14.683
My-- My locations are off
on my phone.

10:14.821 --> 10:16.788
<i>I...</i> It's not on you, Addie.

10:16.926 --> 10:19.377
Look, um, security wants us
to close the clinic.

10:19.515 --> 10:21.034
<i>How long?</i> We recommend the day.

10:21.172 --> 10:22.863
That-- That--
That is dozens--

10:23.001 --> 10:24.209
That's dozens of patients.

10:24.347 --> 10:25.866
There's 100 people out there
right now.

10:26.004 --> 10:27.350
Well, then call in reinforcements

10:27.488 --> 10:28.628
for crowd control!

10:28.766 --> 10:30.319
What do you want us to do,
Altman?

10:31.527 --> 10:33.425
Crisis protocols are on
the second shelf.

10:37.084 --> 10:38.879
Stay open,
call for backup,

10:39.017 --> 10:40.294
<i>and keep me posted.</i>

10:40.432 --> 10:41.986
Got it.
Bu-- Hey, keep your ringer on.

10:42.124 --> 10:43.090
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:44.678 --> 10:46.991
Okay. You heard her.
Call for backup.

10:51.133 --> 10:54.101
Adams still hasn't uploaded
the scans.

10:54.239 --> 10:55.378
Uh, yeah.

10:55.516 --> 10:56.794
Well, give it a minute.

10:56.932 --> 10:58.968
Maybe the system's
being sluggish.

10:59.106 --> 11:00.832
Or <i>he</i> is.

11:00.970 --> 11:03.317
I'm sorry.
I'm... tired.

11:03.455 --> 11:04.387
It's okay.

11:04.525 --> 11:06.217
How are you?

11:06.355 --> 11:07.425
Uh... yeah.

11:07.563 --> 11:08.806
I'm good. Good.
Busy. Yeah.

11:08.944 --> 11:11.532
I went to pick up organs
in San Francisco,

11:11.671 --> 11:14.328
San Antonio, and Santa Fe
last week, so busy.

11:14.466 --> 11:16.089
No plans
for a trip to Boston?

11:16.227 --> 11:18.505
Well, you don't really plan
to pick up organs.

11:18.643 --> 11:20.541
- You know what I mean.
- Yes, I do.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.096
- Have you spoken at all?
- Um, I get a text message

11:23.234 --> 11:25.443
about her getting lost
in the streets of Boston

11:25.581 --> 11:27.100
about, uh--
about once a week.

11:27.238 --> 11:28.929
Mm. Those <i>are</i>
very complicated streets.

11:30.310 --> 11:31.276
Yes.

11:31.414 --> 11:33.934
She's overwhelmed. Yeah.

11:34.072 --> 11:37.110
If it helps at all,
I get all my updates from Zola.

11:37.248 --> 11:41.114
I told her I loved her, and she
pretended not to hear me.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.013
She's complicated.

11:44.151 --> 11:45.359
Yeah.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.189
You make her happy.

11:47.327 --> 11:49.950
Don't give up.

11:50.088 --> 11:52.401
Okay. So I-I dropped off, uh,
Jessica's lab work

11:52.539 --> 11:54.161
and finished
her admission orders.

11:54.299 --> 11:55.369
And the scans?

11:55.507 --> 11:57.647
I-I just uploaded them.

11:57.786 --> 12:00.064
Sorry. I was-- I was dealing
with a house thing.

12:00.202 --> 12:03.136
In a few hours, Jessica's gonna
be open on an operating table

12:03.274 --> 12:05.483
with her vital organs
in our hands.

12:05.621 --> 12:07.450
You cannot get distracted
with house things.

12:07.588 --> 12:08.900
Or anything.
I-I know.

12:09.038 --> 12:10.626
I-I'm sorry.

12:12.455 --> 12:13.733
Uh, the scans are in.

12:13.871 --> 12:17.253
Let's, uh-- Let's take a look,
shall we?

12:17.391 --> 12:18.979
I'm seeing multiple
displaced rib fractures

12:19.117 --> 12:20.774
and a massive hemothorax
on the right side.

12:20.912 --> 12:22.914
Once I place the chest
tube, we'll rush him up to CT.

12:23.052 --> 12:24.398
Right. Agree.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.504
And then to the OR, depending
on his chest tube output.

12:26.642 --> 12:28.402
He has a bad lung contusion.
I'm not sure how long
he'll remain stable.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.888
Ryan Jenkins. Our-- Our
patient's already in the system.

12:31.026 --> 12:32.061
What?
Like he's been here before?

12:32.199 --> 12:33.753
Like he's supposed to be here today.

12:33.891 --> 12:36.169
Directed lung donor, OR 3.
Recipient's Jessica Hall.

12:36.307 --> 12:37.757
That's Maggie's patient.

12:37.895 --> 12:40.898
She's been waiting on a
transplant for almost two years.

12:41.036 --> 12:42.762
Jess... Jess...

12:42.900 --> 12:46.282
Just take....take my--
my lung.

12:46.420 --> 12:48.768
Take-- Just take... Owen: He's hemorrhaging!

12:48.906 --> 12:50.942
Take it.

12:51.080 --> 12:52.599
O2's dropped to 70s.
Damn it.

12:52.737 --> 12:54.808
- Let's get an intubation tray.
- Hang two units of blood.

12:54.946 --> 12:56.776
As soon as he's tubed, we're
heading straight to the OR.

12:56.914 --> 12:57.915
Here's the blood.

12:59.986 --> 13:02.195
Are you sure it's him?

13:03.334 --> 13:04.611
Can I-- Can I see him?

13:04.749 --> 13:06.509
Ryan had his driver's license
on him--

13:06.647 --> 13:08.615
RJ. He goes by RJ.

13:08.753 --> 13:10.444
Either way, it's him.

13:10.582 --> 13:13.206
Dr. Hunt, our trauma surgeon,
is prepping him for surgery now.

13:13.344 --> 13:15.311
He needs surgery?
What kind of surgery?

13:15.449 --> 13:17.279
RJ suffered some injuries
to his chest,

13:17.417 --> 13:19.868
and he's lost
a significant amount of blood.

13:20.006 --> 13:21.317
Oh, my God.

13:21.455 --> 13:23.423
His chest--
Is it his h-heart?

13:23.561 --> 13:24.665
It's his lungs.

13:27.530 --> 13:29.739
- How fast was he driving?
- Are you serious?

13:29.878 --> 13:31.638
Are you really asking
that question right now?

13:33.019 --> 13:35.780
Okay. Jessica, Jessica.

13:35.918 --> 13:38.645
Okay.

13:38.783 --> 13:40.750
I know this is a lot
to take in.

13:40.889 --> 13:44.133
But due to the severity
of RJ's injuries,

13:44.271 --> 13:47.136
he's not going to be able
to donate a lung today.

13:47.274 --> 13:48.724
Or possibly ever.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.139
I don't--
I don't care about that.

13:50.277 --> 13:52.072
Jessica.
Please get out.

13:52.210 --> 13:53.729
I can't--
I can't listen to you right now.

13:53.867 --> 13:54.834
Please get out, Mom.

13:54.972 --> 13:57.008
And please--
please save him.

13:57.146 --> 13:59.079
- Do whatever it takes.
- I'll do everything I can.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.394
Let's, um--
Let's give her a minute.

14:14.163 --> 14:16.200
A vaginal ultrasound
helps determine

14:16.338 --> 14:18.443
how far along
the pregnancy is.

14:18.581 --> 14:21.757
You are counseling the patient,
not persuading, okay?

14:21.895 --> 14:24.518
Offer the facts,
answer questions,

14:24.656 --> 14:26.520
give options, okay?

14:26.658 --> 14:28.005
That's the mifepristone.

14:28.143 --> 14:29.558
It'll block your body's
own progesterone

14:29.696 --> 14:30.870
to stop the pregnancy
from growing.

14:31.008 --> 14:32.216
After you take that,

14:32.354 --> 14:34.597
we'll start you
on the misoprostol.

14:38.705 --> 14:41.742
If you're not sure, you can take
some time and think about it.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.400
I'm sure.
I just don't like pills.

14:44.538 --> 14:46.886
Okay.

14:47.024 --> 14:50.475
I'm two years older
than my mom was when she had me.

14:50.613 --> 14:53.064
She was married,
they lived in a townhome,

14:53.202 --> 14:56.378
and when I look back
at pictures, she seems
like a grown-up.

14:56.516 --> 14:58.414
But I'm not there yet.

14:58.552 --> 15:02.108
I'm still working through the
lasting damage she did to me.

15:02.246 --> 15:06.526
So maybe one day I will be
mentally ready to take that on.

15:06.664 --> 15:09.149
But right now, I can't.

16:01.029 --> 16:02.202
Do you need to be
writing this down?

16:02.340 --> 16:04.653
Uh, sure. Uh...

16:06.689 --> 16:08.726
She will remain
on the UNOS list,

16:08.864 --> 16:11.901
but we'll have to send over
her pre-op labs and scans

16:12.040 --> 16:15.698

Uh, fine. Fine.

16:26.226 --> 16:28.884
I'm just working with Marsh

handle the utilities.

16:37.375 --> 16:38.859
Did you ask Maggie?

16:38.998 --> 16:41.483
Could you? 'Cause she's already
kind of annoyed with me.

16:41.621 --> 16:44.244
No, because then I would have to
be annoyed with you, too.

16:44.382 --> 16:46.005
Okay. Fine.

Well, you know, my place

You can come use

My roommate's pretty cool.
You won't want to have sex

17:17.519 --> 17:18.554
We didn't sleep together.

17:20.763 --> 17:23.732
We just...
kissed maybe twice.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.908
Wow.
Uh, I was bluffing.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.635
But now that we're here,
was it good?

17:30.773 --> 17:32.223
Good kissing?
I'm engaged.

17:32.361 --> 17:33.397
Right, right.
All right.

17:33.535 --> 17:35.399
Trey is a good guy.
He is stable.

17:41.922 --> 17:44.753
Kiss was that good, huh?

17:49.137 --> 17:51.415
Bed 5 is asking for
a birth-control implant.

17:51.553 --> 17:53.244
I'm gonna show Yasuda
how to do that.
Mm-hmm.

17:53.382 --> 17:55.764
And Kwan is finishing
an STD test in bed 3,

17:55.902 --> 17:57.179
so that'll be opened up soon.

17:57.317 --> 17:59.181
Okay.
- Let me know if you need help.
- Okay.

17:59.319 --> 18:02.978
And I want to let <i>you</i> know how
excellent these trainees are.

18:03.116 --> 18:04.566
They <i>should</i> be.

18:04.704 --> 18:07.189
They were picked
from more than 100 applicants.

18:07.327 --> 18:10.917
You know, one of them wrote
that the one silver lining

18:11.055 --> 18:13.506
of <i>not</i> being able
to get this training at home

18:13.644 --> 18:17.579
is being able to learn from
the great Addison Montgomery.

18:17.717 --> 18:20.409
Oh.
Well, that's very kind.

18:20.547 --> 18:23.102
No. It's true.
You know it is.

18:23.240 --> 18:27.692
You know, we could
run trainings... every month

18:27.830 --> 18:28.900
if you want to come back.

18:29.038 --> 18:30.178
I don't know.

18:30.316 --> 18:31.593
No. Okay.

18:31.731 --> 18:33.353
I know that you're busy
with the clinic

18:33.491 --> 18:35.873
and-- and the travel
from Illinois to L.A.

18:36.011 --> 18:38.634
must be just,
you know, hard.

18:38.772 --> 18:40.774
And of-- of course, um,

18:40.912 --> 18:42.707
visiting your family
takes priority.

18:42.845 --> 18:44.951
But, you know,
we'd love to have you

18:45.089 --> 18:47.022
if you could squeeze us in.

18:50.439 --> 18:52.303
Oh, my God!

18:55.030 --> 18:56.859
Oh, my God.
- Hey. Everybody get down.

18:56.997 --> 18:58.102
Down, down.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.104
Okay.
You're bleeding.

19:00.242 --> 19:01.485
He's bleed--
Oh, my God!

19:07.525 --> 19:09.907
No one goes in or out
of the clinic-- not till I have

19:10.045 --> 19:10.942
enough security
to safely evacuate.

19:11.080 --> 19:12.461
Okay.
Thanks, Bailey.

19:12.599 --> 19:15.084
A brick was thrown through
the window of the clinic?

19:15.223 --> 19:16.569
With "Montgomery murders"
written on it.

19:16.707 --> 19:18.743
- It hit Kwan in the head.
- How bad is it?

19:18.881 --> 19:20.228
Have you read
these manuals?

19:20.366 --> 19:21.746
- Cover to cover.
- You know what?

19:21.884 --> 19:25.164
If I had to read giant manuals
for every crisis in Iraq,

19:25.302 --> 19:27.096
I wouldn't have made it out
of Iraq.

19:27.235 --> 19:29.409
Altman, you're supposed
to read them when you're
<i>not</i> in a crisis.

19:29.547 --> 19:31.929
- When is that exactly?
- Is Kwan okay?

19:32.067 --> 19:34.725
He's bleeding,
but he seems to be doing okay.

19:34.863 --> 19:36.244
What do the manuals say

19:36.382 --> 19:38.418
about a large-scale protest
at the clinic?

19:38.556 --> 19:39.937
Nothing.

19:40.075 --> 19:41.594
They were written before
Bailey took over the clinic

19:41.732 --> 19:44.079
and before the Supreme Court
ruled on <i>Dobbs.</i> Perfect.

19:44.217 --> 19:45.770
Where are you going?

19:45.908 --> 19:49.602
To make sure that no more bricks
are thrown at this hospital.

19:55.504 --> 19:56.885
You're doing it wrong.

19:57.023 --> 19:58.542
Y-You should really hold
your fingers

19:58.680 --> 20:00.268
about 12 inches away
from my face.

20:00.406 --> 20:01.855
Just follow
the stupid finger.

20:01.993 --> 20:03.995
Any dizziness?
Changes in your vision?

20:04.133 --> 20:05.549
I'm fine.

20:05.687 --> 20:08.621
Just put the Steri-Strip on
so we can get back to work.

20:08.759 --> 20:11.210
I am so, so sorry.

20:11.348 --> 20:12.935
Pretty sure you didn't throw
the brick.

20:13.073 --> 20:15.214
I kind of did.

20:15.352 --> 20:18.872
I-I posted this this morning
on the way here.

20:19.010 --> 20:21.289
I assumed it was okay.
I'm in Seattle.

20:21.427 --> 20:23.222
People believe
in reproductive rights.

20:23.360 --> 20:24.878
I never thought...

20:25.016 --> 20:27.122
People would use it as a
road map to Addison Montgomery?

20:27.260 --> 20:28.710
They threw a brick
at us.

20:28.848 --> 20:29.745
What do you think
they'll throw next?

20:29.883 --> 20:30.712
- Kwan.
- I'm sorry.

20:30.850 --> 20:31.885
I feel awful.

20:32.023 --> 20:33.370
I'm gonna resign
from my position.

20:33.508 --> 20:34.750
I mean, they're gonna--
they're gonna fire me

20:34.888 --> 20:36.442
once they find out
about the post anyway.

20:36.580 --> 20:38.892
Just the idea that I could've
endangered the one person

20:39.030 --> 20:41.895
that's given me... any hope
in these last few weeks

20:42.033 --> 20:43.138
makes me sick.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.554
But for the first time
in months,

20:45.692 --> 20:49.213
today I woke up proud,
because I was joining the fight.

20:51.215 --> 20:53.217
We shouldn't have to hide
who we are

20:53.355 --> 20:55.150
in order to practice medicine.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.496
So don't resign.

20:56.634 --> 20:59.396
If you do,
that means one less doctor

20:59.534 --> 21:01.225
has made it their mission
to help.

21:01.363 --> 21:02.606
And then they win.

21:04.470 --> 21:06.334
Hilum's intact.

21:06.472 --> 21:07.680
Lung's shredded.

21:09.889 --> 21:11.684
Uh, they want
everyone in the hospital

21:11.822 --> 21:13.099
to stay away
from the clinic.

21:13.237 --> 21:15.412
The ongoing protests
have become violent.

21:15.550 --> 21:17.552
You need to get back downstairs?

21:17.690 --> 21:19.864
I will as soon as I figure out
where this blood's coming from.

21:20.002 --> 21:21.349
Are you gonna do
a lower lobe resection?

21:21.487 --> 21:23.040
If we do that,
then RJ can't be a donor.

21:23.178 --> 21:25.284
But that's not the priority.
He's bleeding out.

21:25.422 --> 21:27.216
All right. Okay. What--
What if I use a hilar clamp

21:27.355 --> 21:29.805
to temporarily stop the bleeding
and do a wedge resection?

21:29.943 --> 21:31.566
It will preserve
more lung tissue

21:31.704 --> 21:33.775
and could allow him to donate
the other lung at a later time.

21:33.913 --> 21:35.363
If you shut off the circulation
from one lung,

21:35.501 --> 21:37.296
- won't his pressure tank?
- Only for a few minutes.

21:37.434 --> 21:38.883
A few minutes could cost him
his life.

21:39.021 --> 21:40.989
Or I could repair the lung
by then.

21:42.128 --> 21:44.441
Fine.
We got to move fast, okay?

21:44.579 --> 21:45.959
Griffith, get ready
with suction.

21:46.097 --> 21:47.651
And, Millin,
take over retraction, okay?

21:47.789 --> 21:49.653
All right. Clamp.

21:52.207 --> 21:53.312
Do you want me
to do it?

21:53.450 --> 21:55.072
No.
I got it.

21:56.211 --> 21:58.282
All right.
Stapler and lap pads.

21:59.870 --> 22:01.423
Patients are getting restless.

22:01.561 --> 22:03.908
The woman in bed 4 threw
a granola bar back at me,

22:04.046 --> 22:06.739
and I found a trainee
crying in the bathroom.

22:06.877 --> 22:08.844
She's fine,
but she's scared.

22:08.982 --> 22:10.329
I think everyone is.

22:10.467 --> 22:12.054
Oh.

22:16.300 --> 22:19.096
Um, team meeting--
right now.

22:19.234 --> 22:21.616
Okay. Guys, come.
Come, come.

22:24.998 --> 22:26.862
Everybody here?
Okay.

22:27.000 --> 22:33.075
Um, so, this clinic is named for
my mom, Elena Bailey,

22:33.213 --> 22:35.561
because...

22:35.699 --> 22:38.874
When I was, uh, 7, I went with
my mom to the grocery store,

22:39.012 --> 22:42.533
and, uh, we got in line
behind a young woman

22:42.671 --> 22:45.433
and
her fussy baby.

22:45.571 --> 22:47.366
Um, for whatever reason,

22:47.504 --> 22:49.816
the woman didn't have
enough money to pay her bill,

22:49.954 --> 22:52.129
so my mom did.

22:52.267 --> 22:55.408
And later, I asked my mom,
"Do you know her?"

22:55.546 --> 23:00.413
And she said, "I know her enough
to know that she's struggling.

23:00.551 --> 23:04.555
And when we can help someone
else going through a tough time,

23:04.693 --> 23:06.212
we should."

23:06.350 --> 23:07.800
These are tough times.

23:07.938 --> 23:10.665
We are struggling as doctors,

23:10.803 --> 23:15.635
as advocates for women's health
and reproductive freedom.

23:15.773 --> 23:18.742
We need to help each other, right?

23:18.880 --> 23:21.745
We need to lift each other up.

23:21.883 --> 23:23.402
That's how we get through.

23:25.645 --> 23:28.303
Dr. Montgomery has been
on the front line, right?

23:28.441 --> 23:29.994
Traveling all over the country.

23:30.132 --> 23:33.515
Do you have any advice
for our young doctors?

23:34.965 --> 23:37.519
Excuse me? Someone?
A doctor maybe?

23:37.657 --> 23:39.763
Yeah.
I think her water
just broke.

23:39.901 --> 23:42.904
Oh. Um, you heard her.
Let's go!

23:43.042 --> 23:44.871
Okay.

23:53.742 --> 23:57.125
Oh, are those, uh,
Jessica's discharge papers?

23:57.263 --> 24:00.266
Crap.
I-I still need to print them.

24:00.404 --> 24:01.267
Sorry.

24:01.405 --> 24:02.751
That's okay.

24:04.028 --> 24:05.789
That's okay.

24:05.927 --> 24:07.618
Meredith left.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.587
I'm aware.

24:10.725 --> 24:13.693
And now I don't know
what I'm even doing here.

24:15.384 --> 24:16.455
Hm.

24:16.593 --> 24:20.528
I just--
I keep screwing up.

24:20.666 --> 24:22.702
With patients,
with-- with papers.

24:22.840 --> 24:25.602
And I-I can't even pay
my gas bill,

24:25.740 --> 24:27.914
and, um...

24:29.916 --> 24:34.334
I-I-I want to believe
that I'm here on my own merit,

24:34.473 --> 24:38.891
but I keep wondering
if I'm just here because of her

24:39.029 --> 24:40.651
and not because
I'm supposed to be.

24:40.789 --> 24:42.342
Right.

24:45.207 --> 24:47.727
Okay.
So... we were supposed

24:47.865 --> 24:50.247
to do a-a directed donation today.

24:50.385 --> 24:52.387
Our patient fasted.
Our donor fasted.

24:52.525 --> 24:53.906
We were prepped
and ready.

24:54.044 --> 24:56.771
It was a transplant surgeon's
dream scenario.

24:57.772 --> 25:00.464
And then RJ gets hit
by a car.

25:00.602 --> 25:02.570
And in
a brutal coincidence,

25:02.708 --> 25:05.365
that accident injures
the very organ we need.

25:06.884 --> 25:09.508
Yeah. Is this story supposed to
be about me somehow?

25:11.579 --> 25:15.099
I'm saying...
the things you worry about

25:15.237 --> 25:17.757
are almost never the things
that really go wrong.

25:17.895 --> 25:20.346
And the things
that do go wrong...

25:20.484 --> 25:21.865
you couldn't have
dreamt up.

25:23.901 --> 25:25.938
Your aunt did not accept you
to this program

25:26.076 --> 25:28.043
out of sentimentality.

25:28.181 --> 25:30.770
She's too good for that,
and so are you.

25:34.429 --> 25:36.500
Get Jessica her discharge
papers, okay?

25:36.638 --> 25:38.364
Yeah.

25:47.856 --> 25:49.064
He--

25:49.202 --> 25:51.515
I'm sorry.
I just...

25:52.551 --> 25:55.899
...needed a breath,
and I, uh...

25:56.037 --> 25:57.521
and I can't go outside, so...

25:57.659 --> 25:59.419
Oh.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.249
Um, you know,
there's this woman

26:01.387 --> 26:04.424
that stands outside the clinic
every Tuesday

26:04.563 --> 26:08.083
with a sign that says,
"Please don't do this."

26:08.221 --> 26:12.571
She doesn't, you know,
yell or try to get in the way.

26:12.709 --> 26:14.883
Even her sign's polite.

26:15.021 --> 26:16.747
And it's still upsetting.

26:16.885 --> 26:19.301
I can't even imagine doing
what you're doing out there.

26:19.439 --> 26:20.820
I got a bulletproof vest.

26:20.958 --> 26:22.477
A what?
Yeah.

26:22.615 --> 26:24.513
Yeah.
Okay.

26:24.652 --> 26:27.171
An old O.B. friend of mine
in Texas, uh, suggested it.

26:27.309 --> 26:28.897
I thought
she was overreacting.

26:29.035 --> 26:33.350
Then I found out her usual
advice is to carry a gun

26:33.488 --> 26:36.353
or hire a bodyguard
with a gun.

26:36.491 --> 26:38.838
Clinics are being set
on fire.

26:38.976 --> 26:40.426
I know.

26:40.564 --> 26:42.601
You know, staff are having acid
thrown in their face

26:42.739 --> 26:43.843
on their way to work.

26:43.981 --> 26:45.362
With the PRT, they--
they just--

26:45.500 --> 26:46.674
they broke
one of the windows.

26:46.812 --> 26:50.022
Don't worry.
I had it replaced.

26:50.160 --> 26:52.852
I'm not worried
about the window.

26:52.990 --> 26:55.441
They doxxed me.

26:55.579 --> 26:57.961
All of my information
is online--

26:58.099 --> 27:01.136
my home address,
my cellphone number.

27:01.274 --> 27:04.553
I got over 500 calls
in one night.

27:04.692 --> 27:07.211
Then they broke into our garage
and graffitied Jake's car.

27:07.349 --> 27:10.387
So now he and Henry are staying
at his sister's,

27:10.525 --> 27:12.216
so, you know,
mom of the year.

27:12.354 --> 27:15.047
That sounds awful,
and I am so sorry

27:15.185 --> 27:16.635
that I suggested
that you go out there--

27:16.773 --> 27:18.878
No, no. Don't you--
Don't be sorry.

27:19.016 --> 27:21.881
I wouldn't have done anything differently.

27:22.019 --> 27:23.538
I'm not gonna...

27:25.954 --> 27:28.716
I'm not gonna quit.
I can't quit.

27:28.854 --> 27:32.340
I mean, patients need this care,
you know?

27:32.478 --> 27:34.894
But I-I put my family in danger.
I put--

27:35.032 --> 27:36.413
Your clinic is in danger.

27:36.551 --> 27:39.243
You are in danger
because of me.

27:39.381 --> 27:42.005
You-- And how am I
gonna go tell these new OBs

27:42.143 --> 27:44.386
that they're gonna be okay
when I'm not?

27:44.524 --> 27:46.250
I am exhausted.

27:46.388 --> 27:47.562
I am terrified.

27:47.700 --> 27:48.908
I'm not okay.
Oh, honey.

27:49.046 --> 27:50.254
Oh.

27:50.392 --> 27:53.188
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

27:54.465 --> 27:57.123
Come on. It's okay.
It's okay.

27:57.261 --> 27:58.953
It's okay.

27:59.091 --> 28:00.540
Oh.

28:06.719 --> 28:11.206
<i>We're setting up an
incident command post with PD
now. North parking lot.</i>

28:11.344 --> 28:12.829
- Copy that. Thanks, Marcus.
- Have you heard from the clinic?
Jo's not responding to texts.

28:12.967 --> 28:14.278
You need somebody
to go over there?

28:14.416 --> 28:15.832
That is exactly what I do <i>not</i>
need someone to do.

28:15.970 --> 28:17.937
Well, have you considered
- closing to trauma?
- Not yet.

28:18.075 --> 28:19.145
I really think
you should...

28:19.283 --> 28:21.458
The media will probably want
a statement.

28:21.596 --> 28:22.770
Do you want me to work on one?
Dr. Altman, there's a situation...

28:22.908 --> 28:24.392
All right.
Everybody stop!

28:24.530 --> 28:25.876
I need to be able to think,
which is impossible to do

28:26.014 --> 28:27.222
when everyone is coming at me
at the same time.

28:27.360 --> 28:28.465
So can you please quiet
your voices

28:28.603 --> 28:29.708
so I can hear
the one in my head?

28:29.846 --> 28:31.433
Okay.
Whatever helps.

28:31.571 --> 28:33.573
What is going on?

28:34.609 --> 28:36.542
Did you want the voice
in your head to answer or...

28:36.680 --> 28:37.612
Talk, Schmitt.
