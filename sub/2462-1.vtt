“HAN HYE-LIN PARK DOO-SIK”

does it matter right now?

01:06.520 --> 01:08.317
It’s better than in the U.S.
The kids are nice to me.

I don’t see them these days.
I’m not scared when I see them.

01:12.600 --> 01:16.036
Don’t worry. If it gets hard,
I’ll go live with uncle.

01:16.520 --> 01:17.520
All right.

01:18.680 --> 01:19.680
You, too, Mom.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.349

02:20.800 --> 02:22.836
- You idiot!
- Cut it out.

02:22.840 --> 02:26.549
You gonna hit me? I heard you see ghosts.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.430
How could I see them?

02:33.440 --> 02:36.113
Hey, you were famous in your last school.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.358
As the bad luck guy who sees ghosts.

02:38.840 --> 02:40.193
Is there any here?

02:40.360 --> 02:42.600
In webcomics, there are always many ghosts
in the subway.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.550
You think I’m talking shit?

02:51.960 --> 02:55.236
Don’t... don’t believe them.
They’re all lies!

02:55.440 --> 02:56.440
Shut it.

02:57.240 --> 03:00.391
I know they’re lies, you fucker!

03:00.960 --> 03:03.633
There’s no way you could see ghosts.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.073
That’s enough.

03:06.120 --> 03:09.317
It’s bad luck to be around this fucker.
Let’s go.

03:30.280 --> 03:31.713
Fuck.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.678

06:51.400 --> 06:55.393
What are you doing? Watching TV again?

06:56.280 --> 07:00.671
What... what am I doing?
Well, I’m always studying.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.031
You know that thing these days...

07:03.520 --> 07:05.351
The Tripitaka Koreana into Latin...

07:05.360 --> 07:07.999
I’m translating it now.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.430
What’s wrong? Got something to say?

07:10.440 --> 07:14.274
Uncle, I think I’ll go live with you.

07:16.720 --> 07:17.869
What? Why?

07:17.880 --> 07:19.552
What... what’s wrong?

07:19.560 --> 07:23.439
Well... l feel a bit lonely and

07:24.920 --> 07:26.717
it’d be great for the uncle and nephew
to live together.

07:26.720 --> 07:27.994
Hey, KANG In-su!

07:28.560 --> 07:31.233
If there are two people who see ghosts,

07:31.240 --> 07:34.152
we’ll have more ghosts following us around.

07:34.160 --> 07:35.229
Understand?

07:37.080 --> 07:37.796
Honestly,

07:37.800 --> 07:40.758
I don’t want to be with you, too, but...

07:44.360 --> 07:46.828
they keep appearing everywhere I go.

07:46.840 --> 07:49.877
It’s because they’ve heard
about how you grant them favors.

07:49.880 --> 07:52.713
You have to totally ignore them!

07:54.840 --> 07:57.115
I already notified the school
that I’m transferring.

07:59.720 --> 08:00.914
Now, why would you decide

08:00.920 --> 08:03.832
that on your own?

08:04.080 --> 08:07.117
As lame as I may be,
I’m still your uncle. Your uncle!

08:09.080 --> 08:11.310
Anyway, you’re living in my parents’ house.

08:13.520 --> 08:16.876
Yeah, well... that’s true, but...

08:18.320 --> 08:19.435
By any chance...

08:20.120 --> 08:25.319
did you hear anything
about A-young’s family?

08:25.440 --> 08:27.192
Who? A-young?

08:27.400 --> 08:31.313
You mean, that incident
when you were in elementary school?

08:31.960 --> 08:34.519
That was a long time ago.

08:34.520 --> 08:36.556
How would I know anything about that now?

09:50.960 --> 09:52.109
Uncle!

09:53.600 --> 09:54.600
Uncle!

10:05.800 --> 10:07.597
Nothing tagged along with you?

10:19.080 --> 10:21.548
Come on in. It’s cold. Cold!

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Come on in.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.394
The whole place is covered with talismans.

10:38.240 --> 10:41.118
But, does it really work?

10:41.120 --> 10:42.553
They call it the placebo effect.

10:44.920 --> 10:45.920
So cold.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.040
Hey!

10:51.640 --> 10:53.039
It’s great-grandfather.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.508
He was a renowned exorcist.

10:58.800 --> 11:02.395
Even with one look at his photo,
most ghosts would just...

11:02.400 --> 11:03.594
Vanish?

11:03.720 --> 11:06.314
Vanish? Don’t know. But, whatever.

11:06.400 --> 11:10.598
We should hope so, right? Let’s sit.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.992
But, are you still unable to go outside?

11:19.200 --> 11:21.668
You know that I have agoraphobia.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.516
But, Mom said it was after
you were possessed by a ghost

11:32.080 --> 11:34.719
and went into a women’s bathhouse.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.795
Who’s telling you such nonsense? Who?

11:41.600 --> 11:43.720
If you’re going to talk like that,
go back to the U.S.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.280
Besides, only old women were there.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.431
I thought I wouldn’t see them in the U.S.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.991
When I couldn’t communicate
with the ghosts,

11:55.440 --> 11:57.431
it totally drove me crazy.

11:58.400 --> 12:01.836
Does the necklace work well?
It’s your great-grandfather’s heirloom.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.120
Yes.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.997
I feel at ease to be back here.

12:13.960 --> 12:14.790
“VIOLENCE FREE SAFE SCHOOL”

12:14.800 --> 12:16.074
This is KANG In-su, the
new transfer student.

12:16.280 --> 12:18.919
Don’t be mean. Be nice. OK?

12:21.520 --> 12:22.560
Aren’t you going to reply?

12:24.680 --> 12:26.511
Yes, ma’am!

12:26.520 --> 12:30.957
- Let’s see. Where should you...
- Teacher, this seat’s free.

12:31.600 --> 12:32.800
Right. There’s a seat for you.

12:33.680 --> 12:34.749
Go sit down.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.798
You all know that
the finals are in a few days, right?

12:42.240 --> 12:43.434
Prepare for it well.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.319
I’m Hyun-ji.

13:12.280 --> 13:13.280
PARK Hyun-ji.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.873
Do Seoul kids all have such soft hands?

13:31.800 --> 13:33.074
You’re really cute.

13:33.680 --> 13:34.760
What do you think about me?

14:59.680 --> 15:05.516
- A palm print on the window?
- Yeah.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.117
And, it was bloody red.

15:08.120 --> 15:10.031
Totally surprised me during class.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.833
That means there’s a lot of grudge.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.751
Is that what happens with a lot of grudge?

15:20.360 --> 15:22.794
I guess you haven’t really
met those really scary ghosts?

15:25.640 --> 15:27.232
What should I do if it appears again?

15:28.880 --> 15:30.029
What should you do?

15:30.120 --> 15:31.872
You should totally ignore it, of course!

15:33.440 --> 15:34.634
You should...

15:59.680 --> 16:00.999
You draw really well.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.676
She can’t see.

16:21.760 --> 16:23.557
And the dog is her guide dog.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.312
I guess you can see the dog, too.

16:36.160 --> 16:38.549
Hey, transfer student!

16:46.440 --> 16:47.873
What you doing there

16:47.880 --> 16:49.598
squatting down like a girl?

16:51.200 --> 16:53.156
Hey, you’re pretty good, huh?

16:56.560 --> 16:58.278
But, where’s the mutt?

16:59.800 --> 17:01.756
Wow, you want to be a painter?

17:02.120 --> 17:04.315
Well, that’s all good and all,

17:04.319 --> 17:05.960
but we got some business to take care of.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.589
Are you strong enough?

17:10.079 --> 17:11.229
Could you take a punch?

17:12.040 --> 17:14.713
Why should I take a punch?

17:16.560 --> 17:17.834
Ki-tae! You explain it to him.

17:18.400 --> 17:22.279
It’s too much for me to tell him.

17:24.440 --> 17:27.954
Why you playing dirty
by hitting on his girl?

17:28.280 --> 17:29.395
What are you talking about?

17:29.400 --> 17:31.391
What am I talking about?
Look how he's playing the innocent!

17:31.400 --> 17:32.879
Fuck!

17:35.040 --> 17:36.439
I’m talking about Hyun-jig.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.553
I’m not interested in her.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.313
Not interested?

17:44.640 --> 17:46.153
You asshole!

17:46.640 --> 17:51.111
You’re not interested? No?
No? Not interested? Fuck!

17:56.040 --> 17:57.234
You’re not interested?

17:57.360 --> 17:59.157
She’s the prettiest girl in our school!

18:00.360 --> 18:02.954
Are you putting us down because you’re from
the big city?

18:06.360 --> 18:08.635
Get out of my way! Fuck!

18:08.640 --> 18:10.153
Wanna know what I hate the most?

18:10.560 --> 18:12.073
Squabbling! You bastard!

18:22.000 --> 18:23.353
Hey, KANG In-su!

18:24.720 --> 18:25.550
Don’t you know who I am?

18:25.560 --> 18:28.199
Yeolsung Elementary School.
Remember A-young?

18:30.720 --> 18:31.789
KANG In-su!

18:31.800 --> 18:34.837
- A-young keeps talking to you?
- The missing kid?

18:34.840 --> 18:37.229
She says she can’t breathe underwater.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.708
- You shouldn’t lie like that.
- If you keep lying...

18:39.720 --> 18:41.995
It’s true! A-young’s right here!

18:43.720 --> 18:45.631
Where did this water come from?

18:46.160 --> 18:47.718
Can’t breathe. I can’t breathe.

18:47.720 --> 18:48.550
I can’t breathe!

18:48.560 --> 18:49.560
I can’t breathe!!

18:52.560 --> 18:55.552
I don’t want ghost-ridden kid hanging
around Hyun-ji.

18:58.760 --> 19:02.275
So, you better lie low and don’t make me
spread rumors about you.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.635
“CHORONG”

19:32.840 --> 19:36.355
Yeah, mom. Just got out.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.192
Did you find Chorong?

19:39.720 --> 19:42.553
Did you really lose him?

19:43.080 --> 19:44.080
Whatever. Bye.

20:11.280 --> 20:12.554
What the...

20:14.520 --> 20:15.396
Fuck!

20:15.400 --> 20:18.392
You bitches fucking scared me!

20:18.400 --> 20:20.868
You act all stuck up but you’re such
a scaredy-cat.

20:20.880 --> 20:22.598
Bullshit. When was I?

20:22.600 --> 20:24.989
Then, why’d you get all jumpy like
a crazy bitch?

20:25.320 --> 20:26.514
Don’t know...

20:27.720 --> 20:28.720
Let’s go.

22:04.680 --> 22:05.680
Where are you?!

22:05.760 --> 22:08.877
Who the fuck are you? Come out!

22:10.600 --> 22:12.272
Come on out!

22:30.040 --> 22:31.792
- What?
- Na-ra...

22:33.040 --> 22:34.951
That bitch is here!

22:35.120 --> 22:37.793
Sae-hee is... Sae-hee!

22:37.800 --> 22:39.358
What? Who’s there?

22:40.080 --> 22:42.355
I can’t hear you. Speak up.

22:45.040 --> 22:47.759
Hey, Sung-hee!

22:48.440 --> 22:50.954
Hello? Hello?

22:53.120 --> 22:57.033
Hey, Sung-hee. Say it again. Huh?

22:58.400 --> 22:59.549
Hello?

23:01.040 --> 23:02.393
Hello?

23:03.800 --> 23:04.949
Hello?

23:12.960 --> 23:14.359
Wait. Come over here.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.278
Why? Why, Hae-chul?

23:16.520 --> 23:20.638
Does this hurt? Or this? Or this?

23:21.360 --> 23:22.918
- They all hurt...
- Oh, then...

23:22.920 --> 23:25.036
- The second one hurts more...
- Get up. Get up.

23:27.640 --> 23:31.235
I think Sung-hee’s ran away again.
She didn't get home yesterday.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.597
- Again?
- Yeah.

23:34.120 --> 23:37.908
How come she runs away like
she’s just going out for a walk?

23:38.640 --> 23:41.074
Hae-chul!(Porn... porn!)

23:53.160 --> 23:55.390
Hey, you mutt! Go fetch the ball!

23:55.600 --> 23:58.637
Come on. Kick the ball right.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.676
I know you can see me.

24:02.680 --> 24:04.272
At the bus stop, the guide dog!

24:04.720 --> 24:06.120
Are you gonna keep acting that way?

24:07.720 --> 24:10.951
Wow. You’re totally ignoring me...

24:13.120 --> 24:15.395
I won’t ask you to relieve any grudges.

24:15.920 --> 24:16.636
Really?

24:16.720 --> 24:18.756
How mean of you!

24:19.440 --> 24:22.000
Do you think I’m talking
to you because I like you?

24:22.080 --> 24:25.152
I’m bored and I’ve no other choice...

24:25.520 --> 24:26.748
but to talk to you...

24:30.800 --> 24:32.028
Did you go to this school?

24:33.760 --> 24:34.988
I don’t know.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.313
I can’t really remember...

24:37.880 --> 24:40.189
whether I did or not.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.191
Don’t even know my name.

24:44.160 --> 24:45.639
Maybe it’s because I’m a ghost?

24:46.520 --> 24:47.999
Just because I was nice to you,

24:48.000 --> 24:49.360
you think we’re on the same level?

24:51.080 --> 24:53.320
If you want to die,
just keep trying to walk all over me.

24:55.080 --> 24:56.593
Why don’t you do something?

24:56.760 --> 24:58.796
He’s getting beat up for no reason.

25:11.240 --> 25:14.312
Hush! It’s the Mask!

25:32.760 --> 25:34.398
Shit. That was embarrassing.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.718
Well, no one’s around...

26:22.320 --> 26:23.833
So dusty...

27:24.880 --> 27:26.677
These two are a pair.

27:26.680 --> 27:28.910
When the sword gets under the spell,

27:28.920 --> 27:32.230
it’s set that this dagger gets under
the spell, too.

27:33.600 --> 27:37.434
Why care so much
about what a ghost said to you?

27:38.080 --> 27:40.036
But, she was right.

27:40.640 --> 27:41.709
Oh, geez.

27:43.560 --> 27:46.711
Whether a friend gets bullied or beat up,

27:46.800 --> 27:48.233
they don’t care.

27:50.440 --> 27:51.634
Me, neither...

27:54.280 --> 27:59.559
Well, it wasn’t like that
when I was in school.

28:00.520 --> 28:03.353
If a friend in my class got beat up,

28:03.360 --> 28:06.079
I stepped in to help the friend.

28:06.080 --> 28:09.277
I firmly handled such a
situation, as I recall.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.400
That’s how I remember it.

28:12.280 --> 28:13.395
You don’t believe me.

28:14.280 --> 28:18.239
Yeah, you don’t have to believe me.
You really don’t.

28:24.800 --> 28:26.233
Legs, do the split!

28:29.000 --> 28:31.195
One, two

28:31.880 --> 28:34.348
If I told the truth back then...

28:40.400 --> 28:44.996
A-young’s perpetrator would’ve
been caught much earlier, for sure.

28:45.640 --> 28:52.591
Anyway, it’s good that he did get caught.

28:52.760 --> 28:57.515
And, you were also the victim, right?

29:02.320 --> 29:07.917
Because of that,
you had to leave your hometown.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.234
Who are you?

29:28.200 --> 29:32.273
Yes! Moongchi has a scar on the front paw.

29:32.280 --> 29:33.269
“MOONGCHI”

29:33.280 --> 29:35.360
It also has a name tag
with ‘Moongchi’ written on it.

29:37.360 --> 29:41.114
Is my Moongchi really here?

29:43.080 --> 29:46.436
Yes, quietly sitting by your feet.

29:47.880 --> 29:50.440
No, a bit more to the left!

29:52.600 --> 29:54.591
Your girlfriend was here, too?

29:56.000 --> 29:58.753
Can you... hear my voice?

29:58.760 --> 30:01.194
Of course. I hear you very well.

30:02.640 --> 30:05.154
Why? Should I not hear you?

30:05.680 --> 30:08.319
No! You should. Of course.

30:08.520 --> 30:11.637
If you don’t believe me, you don’t have to.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.678
No! I believe you.

30:17.240 --> 30:18.912
I want to believe.

30:24.000 --> 30:28.073
So, A-young was the first
ghost you ever saw?

30:30.960 --> 30:31.870
Yeah.

30:31.880 --> 30:36.158
A-young... Iet's go home...

30:39.400 --> 30:44.190
No! No! No!

30:44.680 --> 30:48.912
She was in my class in elementary school.

30:49.760 --> 30:53.116
One day, she was found dead.

30:59.240 --> 31:00.639
A-young told me

31:00.640 --> 31:02.870
- Why arena’t you saying anything?
- about the perpetrator.

31:02.880 --> 31:07.635
- You said you knew, In-su.
- But, I lied.

31:08.360 --> 31:11.318
In-su. In-su.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.550
I’m not sure.

31:15.560 --> 31:19.348
I thought it’d get better
if I just left here.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.798
But, why did you come back?

31:26.160 --> 31:30.870
It felt like... A-young was waiting for me.

32:21.600 --> 32:22.635
Ex... Excuse me...

32:34.960 --> 32:36.075
Who are you?

32:38.400 --> 32:40.231
It’s not your fault.

32:40.800 --> 32:43.075
You even helped find A-young.

32:43.960 --> 32:47.919
Thanks for remembering and dropping by.

33:12.680 --> 33:14.432
Over there...

33:47.320 --> 33:51.074
A-young must've been waiting for you.

34:24.159 --> 34:25.878
Now...

34:27.600 --> 34:30.239
I feel a bit relieved.

35:13.080 --> 35:14.080
Your hands...

35:14.760 --> 35:15.760
Put them here.

35:34.760 --> 35:38.673
That’s strange... My
hands really feel warm.

35:40.440 --> 35:41.919
Really?

36:39.040 --> 36:40.837
School life's good for you these days?

36:44.040 --> 36:45.109
What?

36:47.040 --> 36:48.917
Embarrassed to get hit by a girl?

36:49.120 --> 36:50.348
Makes you mad?

36:52.080 --> 36:53.274
Getting on your nerves?

36:55.560 --> 36:57.676
Feeling angry and annoyed?

36:59.040 --> 37:01.838
Better let that hand go
if you don’t want to die.

37:04.400 --> 37:05.400
Stop it.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.875
You dick! I told you to
let go of that hand!

37:10.640 --> 37:11.755
Why are you butting in?

37:14.960 --> 37:16.757
Because you’re bullying for no reason!

37:26.560 --> 37:28.278
What a dork!

37:30.400 --> 37:31.515
Let’s go.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.913
Idiots.

38:26.920 --> 38:31.596
Come on out. I know. So, come out.

39:08.640 --> 39:09.709
“MURDER OF WOMAN
IN HER THIRTIES”

39:09.720 --> 39:11.153
On the 23rd,
the crime scene inspection was held

39:11.160 --> 39:12.718
with Ms. HWANG’s murder suspect,
Mr. PARK.

39:12.720 --> 39:14.199
“MURDERED AND BURIED
AFTER 10 YEARS OF STALKING”

39:14.200 --> 39:18.557
PARK is accused of killing
and secretly burying Ms. HWANG

39:18.560 --> 39:20.869
after stalking her for 10 years.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.399
The police concludes it

39:22.400 --> 39:24.755
as an accidental crime of passion...

39:24.760 --> 39:25.875
The mask...

39:25.880 --> 39:28.110
and will wrap up the case.

39:28.120 --> 39:29.075
People looking over the scene...

39:29.080 --> 39:30.433
So noisy! Really!

39:34.880 --> 39:39.078
How can I help you if
you don’t say anything?

39:39.840 --> 39:41.796
Say something. Say it!

39:43.120 --> 39:45.111
How could a ghost lack so much confidence?

39:45.240 --> 39:48.391
That ghost... who could she be?

39:48.520 --> 39:50.670
This one here is enough for me.

39:53.520 --> 39:57.229
What kind of a grudge made her roam
the school in a mask?

39:57.240 --> 39:58.389
- Are you gonna really keep...
- Sae-hee.

39:58.400 --> 39:59.719
What Sae-hee?

40:04.280 --> 40:07.317
Sae-hee? Who’s Sae-hee?

40:08.600 --> 40:10.238
She's the Mask.

40:12.640 --> 40:13.675
You know what her grudge is?

40:13.680 --> 40:15.955
What’s her grudge? Her grudge!

40:15.960 --> 40:16.960
- She’s...
- Yeah?

40:17.840 --> 40:19.831
- Sae-hee.
- Damn.

40:21.360 --> 40:23.590
Can’t you hear me?
I asked you what her grudge was.

40:23.600 --> 40:24.874
- She’s...
- Yeah?

40:25.160 --> 40:26.593
- the Mask.
- Geez!

40:27.000 --> 40:28.513
You really can’t understand me?

40:28.800 --> 40:30.358
Open up! Open your ear!

40:30.360 --> 40:31.679
I can’t stand this.

40:31.680 --> 40:34.558
Being a ghost, isn’t it time for you
to tell me by now?

40:34.800 --> 40:36.631
I am fed up with your consistent style.

40:36.720 --> 40:38.836
Why not have bangs or get it layered?

40:38.960 --> 40:40.313
Use some hair treatment!

40:40.560 --> 40:42.790
And, those cheap circle lenses!

40:56.960 --> 40:58.154
Did you find it?

40:58.600 --> 41:00.511
No, it’s not in there.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.359
Shit...

41:03.600 --> 41:05.431
Ta-da! What’s this?

41:07.760 --> 41:09.990
I thought I’d die without this.

41:10.080 --> 41:11.274
Was it in the teacher’s drawer?

41:11.280 --> 41:12.713
Yeah, I did good, huh?

41:22.960 --> 41:26.794
Wow, the classroom looks totally different
at this hour.

41:32.720 --> 41:36.998
Hae-chul and Hyun-ji had sex.

41:40.880 --> 41:43.189
Stop. Come here.

41:44.080 --> 41:45.308
Why not?

41:50.960 --> 41:52.313
What?

41:52.320 --> 41:54.276
I gotta go to the bathroom.

41:54.400 --> 41:56.197
Again?

41:57.920 --> 41:59.717
Number 1 or 2?

42:01.920 --> 42:03.069
Number... 2.

42:05.360 --> 42:07.590
Hurry back. Or else, I’ll go after you.

42:11.440 --> 42:12.759
Hurry back!

42:59.120 --> 43:04.353
Hey, Ki-tae! Stop fooling around.

43:09.880 --> 43:14.829
Really, stop it.
Can’t take a shit because of you.

45:30.160 --> 45:32.879
Oh, no. Oh, no. Ki-tae.

45:35.080 --> 45:36.115
Ki-tae.

45:36.120 --> 45:38.315
Ki-tae. Ki-tae, where are you?

45:38.320 --> 45:40.276
Where are you, Ki-tae?

45:57.680 --> 45:58.999
Na-ra.

46:00.640 --> 46:01.959
Ki-Tae?

46:37.760 --> 46:39.034
Hyun-ji??

46:39.640 --> 46:41.551
Sung-hee’s...

46:41.800 --> 46:43.711
got a mask on like Sae-hee...

46:43.720 --> 46:45.756
Na-ra, It’s me. Sae-hee...

47:13.240 --> 47:16.391
Detective, they’re just runaways.

47:16.400 --> 47:17.355
“A FRIEND’S TEAR”

47:17.360 --> 47:19.032
First, Sung-hee. Now, Na-ra and Ki-tae.

47:19.040 --> 47:21.349
It’s weird to see all of them
as simple runaways.

47:21.360 --> 47:22.236
“SCHOOL VIOLENCE REPORT BOX”

47:22.240 --> 47:24.913
- You guys don’t know anything?
- No, ma’am.

47:29.200 --> 47:31.191
Hyun-ji??

47:31.200 --> 47:36.069
Sung-hee’s got a mask on like Sae-hee...

47:43.000 --> 47:43.716
What?

47:43.920 --> 47:46.309
Do you know a girl named Sae-hee?

47:50.880 --> 47:52.154
Sae-hee?

47:56.600 --> 47:58.591
She committed suicide a while ago.

48:01.080 --> 48:02.593
Suicide?

48:03.720 --> 48:06.439
Do you have her photo in your phone?

48:06.440 --> 48:08.192
Why do you want her photo for?

48:13.920 --> 48:15.956
Just curious.

48:19.360 --> 48:21.112
I...I don’t have it.

48:23.880 --> 48:25.598
She was such a bitch.

48:27.040 --> 48:28.871
So, I doubt anybody took a photo with her.

48:48.120 --> 48:49.553
Look...

48:51.640 --> 48:53.119
Does anybody have Sae-hee’s photo?

48:58.400 --> 49:00.994
Nobody? Not even one person?

49:18.360 --> 49:21.238
Wow! You’re really good.

49:21.840 --> 49:23.239
Do it again. Again, again!

49:23.720 --> 49:25.597
I’ll gather the stones for you.

49:25.600 --> 49:26.828
Hold on.

49:31.600 --> 49:35.832
UHAE JUNG: ITS SAE-HEE’S PHOTO.
DON’T ASK ME ANYTHING ELSE.”

49:37.520 --> 49:39.750
That girl named Sae-hee...

49:42.120 --> 49:43.712
do you know why she ended up like that?

49:44.720 --> 49:46.278
Up until now,

49:47.280 --> 49:50.192
nobody was curious about why Sae-hee died.

49:53.600 --> 49:55.158
Do you know why?

49:56.320 --> 49:58.754
It’s because they all
knew why Sae-hee died.

49:59.840 --> 50:03.879
The reason why Sae-hee's ghost

50:04.080 --> 50:06.389
roams the school in a mask is...

50:22.600 --> 50:25.034
Bring it on! Bring it on! Fuck!

50:35.960 --> 50:36.960
Get up.

50:41.840 --> 50:44.308
- Stop it, now. Stop!
- Fuck, you wanna die?

50:44.920 --> 50:46.399
Sae-hee...

50:46.960 --> 50:48.757
You guys killed Sae-hee.

50:50.320 --> 50:52.197
What’s this crazy asshole talking about?

50:52.200 --> 50:56.512
Sae-hee'll punish all of you.

50:56.520 --> 50:58.556
- You crazy dick!
- So?

51:00.200 --> 51:01.792
What do you want from us?

51:02.520 --> 51:04.954
Let people know what you did wrong and ask
for forgiveness.

51:04.960 --> 51:06.951
What did we do so wrong?

51:06.960 --> 51:09.793
- Fuck! She just killed herself!
- No!

51:10.280 --> 51:13.989
You guys killed her. You
guys killed Sae-hee!

51:14.400 --> 51:15.674
So fucked up.

51:23.360 --> 51:24.759
Come on. Try again.

51:26.360 --> 51:27.554
You guys killed her!

51:27.560 --> 51:30.074
- l told you to shut up!
- That’s enough!

51:56.200 --> 52:00.432
Don’t worry about what that ghost-kid said.

52:01.200 --> 52:04.875
In-su might be right.

52:05.120 --> 52:06.348
What?

52:06.880 --> 52:09.633
Sung-hee, Na-ra, and Ki-tae...

52:10.800 --> 52:12.950
Did they ever not call us this long?

52:20.280 --> 52:21.280
Look at this.

52:22.960 --> 52:24.951
These lips...

52:25.520 --> 52:26.953
Don’t you remember?

52:26.960 --> 52:29.599
At Sae-hee’s funeral,
he gave us the scary stare.

52:31.920 --> 52:32.920
Sae-hee’s dad?

52:33.080 --> 52:36.356
Before In-su talked about Sae-hee,
I didn’t know who it was.

52:39.920 --> 52:41.273
Then, this is...

52:43.440 --> 52:45.112
Where did you get this photo?

52:49.680 --> 52:52.911
Hey, KANG In-su.
You skipped the self-study session?

52:55.160 --> 52:56.639
Yeah...

52:58.240 --> 53:03.360
This is... tangent 20 degrees?
Can’t calculate.

53:04.960 --> 53:08.635
Anyway, In-su. In-su!

53:10.200 --> 53:11.200
You can’t see, right?

53:15.120 --> 53:16.599
See what?

53:16.600 --> 53:18.113
The virgin ghost.

53:19.200 --> 53:20.155
Yeah?

53:20.160 --> 53:21.718
Look to the right. To the right.

53:25.120 --> 53:26.120
Not there, right?

53:26.520 --> 53:29.717
Up there, at the edge of the roof.
And, over there.

53:30.960 --> 53:32.234
Not there, right?

53:34.200 --> 53:39.035
Ever since your uncle
built this sturdy pyramid,

53:39.040 --> 53:41.429
no evil spirits are hanging around.

53:41.800 --> 53:45.110
Where are they? Where?

53:45.400 --> 53:46.719
Come on, Uncle.

53:51.440 --> 53:52.440
Oh, this? It’s...

54:00.160 --> 54:03.835
What are you doing in front of my nephew?

54:05.400 --> 54:08.233
No. Go away. Go away.

54:08.240 --> 54:09.434
Don’t come over here.

54:11.160 --> 54:12.639
Don’t!

54:17.120 --> 54:20.078
You’re eating the talisman?

54:21.760 --> 54:23.193
Your ghost friend was right.

54:25.720 --> 54:27.600
The ghost was Sae-hee and
Sae-hee was the Mask.

54:28.680 --> 54:31.433
Then, it’s a ghost with
multiple personalities.

54:36.320 --> 54:38.993
Without a doubt, Sae-hee’s
dad did all this.

54:39.360 --> 54:43.831
- To be safe, let’s bring In-su.
- Fuck!

54:47.320 --> 54:49.390
I told you not to talk about him!

54:56.560 --> 54:59.996
The personalities probably split right
before death.

55:01.360 --> 55:05.194
Huh? What... how?

55:05.760 --> 55:08.274
Multiple personality disorder occurs

55:08.280 --> 55:12.671
when the original personality
can’t stand the pain and anger,

55:12.760 --> 55:15.957
and hides behind a new personality.

55:16.160 --> 55:22.633
The fact that it changed
its appearance by wearing a mask,

55:22.640 --> 55:25.234
it must've been the decisive cause
for the split.

55:26.160 --> 55:29.436
The revengeful ghost must be stopped
from doing evil things.

55:29.440 --> 55:31.158
But, it won’t be so easy.

55:38.560 --> 55:40.198
“HYUN-JI: KANG IN-SU.”

55:40.200 --> 55:44.352
“WE’RE AT SAE-HEE’S HOUSE.
CAN YOU COME HERE?”

55:46.680 --> 55:48.830
What are they thinking?

55:48.840 --> 55:51.354
What do they think they can do over there?

55:51.800 --> 55:53.631
- I have to go.
- Hey!

55:53.640 --> 55:55.312
Going there won’t solve anything.

55:55.320 --> 55:57.117
Then, what should I do?
Will you go instead?

55:57.120 --> 55:59.270
How... how can I go there? Huh?

55:59.600 --> 56:02.353
I need my exorcist kit
and I’m not mentally prepared...

56:02.440 --> 56:05.512
I have to prepare myself.

56:06.080 --> 56:07.559
Hey, wait!

56:11.840 --> 56:15.435
Here. At least, take these.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.195
You keep hiding out like that.

56:20.560 --> 56:22.596
I can’t let anything bad happen to Sae-hee.

56:23.040 --> 56:24.314
Hey!

57:26.280 --> 57:28.111
Why is it so cold in here?

58:29.200 --> 58:30.918
Open the door! Open the door!

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
Open the door!

58:32.440 --> 58:33.440
Open the fucking door!

58:47.840 --> 58:49.159
It’s open.

58:49.560 --> 58:51.994
Did... did something come out?

59:06.280 --> 59:07.280
Sae-hee...

59:09.680 --> 59:10.680
Fuck!

59:13.000 --> 59:14.399
Fuck!

59:26.760 --> 59:27.760
Stay right here.

59:30.040 --> 59:31.040
Fuck you!

59:34.280 --> 59:35.679
Fuck!

59:55.800 --> 59:58.712
Ghost or not, you better fucking come out!

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.348
I’m sorry, Sae-hee.

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.240
I’m sorry.

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.639
Sae-hee...

01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:00.029
Nobody helped Sae-hee.

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:03.960
Hey, LEE Hye-jung!

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.276
I told you I only drink imported water.

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:09.519
Go and get it again!

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.632
Can’t you get it right?

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.438
I clearly warned you before.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.317
Graduate without making trouble.

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.157
Look at this.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:32.111
Someone reported you
on the School Violence Report Form.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.078
Hitting you would only hurt my hand.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.672
So, bring your parents in tomorrow.

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.638
I don’t live with my parents.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.678
Are you messing with me?

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.398
How dare you look straight into my eyes!

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:53.030
My so-called dad shacked up
with another woman...

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:56.355
and my mom killed herself
after being depressed.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:59.113
Just bring whoever you can. Got that?

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.035
Now, go!

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:17.110
“SCHOOL VIOLENCE REPORT FORM”

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.634
Keep a tight lookout!

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.515
Was it you? You?

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.635
You’re dead today! Come over here!

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:02.911
Hey! Mind your own business.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.077
You crazy bitch.

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:10.640
Wanna die?

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:13.877
From today, Sae-hee is
the slave, not Hye-jung.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.160
Grab her so I can confirm her as the slave!

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.878
Relax.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.834
Stay still.

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:33.430
- More, more! Draw more!
- Oh, how pretty.

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:37.194
- Should I cut some more hair?
- Yeah.

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.359
- Cut some more?
- Yeah!

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.071
- Cut some more?
- This is fun!

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:48.153
Your mouth is the problem.

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.553
That’s right.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:54.032
Stay still!

01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:58.832
If you take the mask off,

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.238
you’re dead.

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:16.390
Eat this, too. Eat!

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:24.749
Let’s just report to the police.

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.349
Are you crazy?

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.032
Do you know how scary they are?

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:32.032
- Then, let’s consult your teacher.
- The teacher?

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:35.039
She gets annoyed and doesn’t care at all.

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:38.396
Other kids like it when I’m bullied.
It makes them feel safe.

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:40.511
Nobody’s ever taken my side!

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.032
What do you know, dad?

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:45.873
What do you know? What?

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:09.273
Wearing that mask everyday...

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.880
Is it some kind of a costume play?

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:17.035
Sit down. I’m confiscating it!

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.040
If you wear it again,
I’ll confiscate that, too!

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.995
I told you not to take the mask off!

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:42.193
Why bother to live?

01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:50.957

The Mask has stirred things up!

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.600
You know Sae-hee's house?

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.035
Please get to Sae-hee’s house.

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:28.560
What?

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:32.920
Yeah, you’re right.

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:55.795
Where’s the teacher?

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.233
Dunno. Just told us to be here.

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:59.196
- What’s wrong?
- We have to get out of here!

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.152
Hurry! Get out of here!

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:05.913
Why? What’s wrong?

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.353
The door’s not opening.

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.117
Over there...

Hey, don’t you smell gasoline?

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.517

Sae... Sae... Sae-hee!

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:56.877
You ignored it all when you all knew
what was going on.

Don’t! We’re sorry!

Sae-hee. Can you hear me?

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:28.428
You’re not Sae-hee!

Did you forget about it already?

That fire pit of hell?

01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:00.798
They didn’t do anything wrong.

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:02.792
Of course, they did!

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.553
You even said so!

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:07.911
That bystanders were worse
than Hyun-ji or Hae-chul.

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:09.997
Those who harrassed and mocked you.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.520
Have you already forgotten about them?

Stop it. Stop. Stop.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:17.953

Those horrible things they did to you.

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.158
You suffered because you’re that weak.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.909
Get away!

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.996
I’m not weak any more.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:43.076
Now, it’s your turn to suffer.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:47.799
I’ll return all the pain
and fear that I went through.

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.150
How scared and hurt I was...

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.996
You should feel the same!

01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:59.148
That’s enough!

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:22.960

even more than Hyun-ji or Hae-chul.

Don’t let them hit you.
Next time, run away.

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:11.238
What’ll you do without me?

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:30.588

notebook back then...

I know.

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:55.799

You should throw it right.

Try it again.

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:12.595
I’m off to work!

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:15.592
Yeah, bye.

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.239
- Look.
- Just marry the ghost already!

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.719
Make an arc. Like this.

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.119
Then, it’ll go in my mouth.

- All right?
- Yes, sir.
