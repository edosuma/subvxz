WEBVTT

00:00.883 --> 00:01.815
- Not human?

00:01.916 --> 00:03.450
Do you mean that ironically or...

00:03.550 --> 00:06.583
- No, I mean Frankie's
literally not human.

00:06.683 --> 00:11.183
It's the only possible
explanation for... for everything.

00:11.283 --> 00:15.050
- I don't think it's
the only possible explanation.

00:15.150 --> 00:16.350
- Maybe she's from the future.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.150
She's heard
all the questions before.

00:18.250 --> 00:19.883
That would explain
why she knows all the answers.

00:19.983 --> 00:20.950
- That's ridiculous.

00:21.050 --> 00:22.483
- Can we talk about this later?

00:22.583 --> 00:25.450
Whatever she is,
she's the only one of us

00:25.550 --> 00:28.650
who knows anything
about mechanical engineering.

00:28.750 --> 00:33.016
We're about to lose our slot at
states because she's not here.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.083
- She's here!

00:35.183 --> 00:38.116
Now put those
new vocal chords to use.

00:38.216 --> 00:41.216
I hope I put them in right.

00:41.316 --> 00:42.483
And now let's welcome

00:42.583 --> 00:45.050
the Sepulveda High School
Brain Squad.

00:48.850 --> 00:49.983
- Fill in the blank.

00:50.083 --> 00:54.183
In a blank drive,
no slip occurrence takes place.

00:55.350 --> 00:56.516
Sepulveda?

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:07.450 --> 01:10.050
- I'm sorry, Sepulveda,
your time is up.

01:10.150 --> 01:11.983
Figueroa, do you have an answer?

01:12.083 --> 01:12.983
- Chain?

01:13.083 --> 01:14.350
Correct.

01:18.250 --> 01:20.916
- Frankie, what's going on?

01:22.116 --> 01:23.583
Bearings.

01:23.683 --> 01:25.116
- Figueroa?

01:25.216 --> 01:29.116
Heat dissipaters.

01:40.516 --> 01:41.950
- What's the deal
with your friend?

01:42.050 --> 01:44.816
She's killing us.

01:44.916 --> 01:46.083
Tell me when it's over.

01:46.183 --> 01:47.816
I can't watch.

01:47.916 --> 01:51.650
- Your first task is to give us
Dr. Gaines' Droid Sync password.

01:51.750 --> 01:52.416
- No idea.

01:52.516 --> 01:53.616
What's my second task?

01:53.716 --> 01:54.650
- No, no, no.

01:54.750 --> 01:56.116
You said you were
privy to everything.

01:56.216 --> 01:58.783
- Look, I can't work with
all the negative energy, okay?

01:58.883 --> 02:01.016
I'm gonna go
to the cafeteria and...

02:01.116 --> 02:02.550
- Tattoo!

02:02.650 --> 02:05.816
Mr. Kingston, EGG dress code
strictly forbids physical marks

02:05.916 --> 02:07.016
on an employee's skin.

02:07.116 --> 02:07.983
Fire him.

02:08.083 --> 02:09.116
- "Robots Rule."

02:09.216 --> 02:10.949
- It's just a band
that I'm into.

02:11.050 --> 02:13.216
- What Dr. Gaines be "into"
that band as well?

02:13.350 --> 02:15.616
- No way. She hated them.

02:15.716 --> 02:17.683
Dr. Gaines was obsessed
with this

02:17.783 --> 02:20.483
annoying '90s boy band
Fifth Movement.

02:20.583 --> 02:22.483
- PEGS1, you know what to do.

02:22.583 --> 02:24.516
Try Fifth Movement.

02:24.616 --> 02:27.150
- Mr. Kingston,
this is our last chance.

02:27.250 --> 02:30.883
If we get it wrong, it will
disable Droid Sync permanently.

02:30.983 --> 02:32.216
- Just do as I say.

02:33.983 --> 02:36.783
- Yes! We're in!

02:36.883 --> 02:39.050
Which means you are out.

02:39.150 --> 02:40.250
PEGS1.

02:44.083 --> 02:45.350
Correct.

02:45.416 --> 02:48.383
Figueroa leads 175 to 25.

02:50.916 --> 02:53.816
Vocal cord
install complete.

02:53.916 --> 02:56.916
- One unit of BTU
is how many joules?

02:57.016 --> 02:58.050
Sepulveda?

02:58.150 --> 02:59.916
- One thousand,
fifty-five point zero six.

03:00.016 --> 03:01.116
Correct.

03:01.216 --> 03:03.350
Define torque.

03:03.416 --> 03:04.883
- A force that causes rotation.

03:06.516 --> 03:08.150
- Hydro-dynamic
lubricated bearings.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.350
Cycloidal gears.

03:10.383 --> 03:13.483
Digital twice spark ignition.

03:13.583 --> 03:15.150
- Time's up, Sepulveda wins.

03:15.250 --> 03:16.916
You're on your way
to the state finals.

03:21.116 --> 03:22.383
- How's it feel to be a hero?

03:22.483 --> 03:24.350
- It feels amazing.

03:24.450 --> 03:25.716
I didn't go online.

03:25.816 --> 03:28.050
I studied, and I helped us win,
just like a human.

03:28.150 --> 03:29.250
- I know you did.

03:29.350 --> 03:31.350
I'm so proud of you.

03:32.816 --> 03:34.583
You still need to work
on the hugging though.

03:38.816 --> 03:39.883
Enjoy this.

03:39.983 --> 03:42.683
I'm gonna do
some rogue robot hunting.

03:42.783 --> 03:44.650
BRB.

03:44.750 --> 03:48.450
- A new smoothie creation
to celebrate Sepulveda's big win

03:48.550 --> 03:52.550
and its newest Brain Squad star,
the Frothy Frankie.

03:52.650 --> 03:55.350
It's so frothy.

03:55.416 --> 03:57.150
- I know you want
a frothy, Frankie.

03:59.250 --> 04:00.650
- No thank you, I do not.

04:00.750 --> 04:03.050
- Come on, Frankie,
she made it in your honor.

04:03.150 --> 04:05.650
How could you not try it?

04:05.750 --> 04:07.516
Danger, harmful liquid.

04:09.616 --> 04:12.483
- Uh, what are you
looking for, Dayton?

04:12.583 --> 04:14.350
- Your battery.

04:14.450 --> 04:15.916
How are you powered?

04:16.016 --> 04:17.050
- Food calories.

04:17.149 --> 04:19.483
Approximately 2,000 a day.

04:19.583 --> 04:22.183
- Come on, Robbie,
come clean with me.

04:22.350 --> 04:23.850
You think robots rule,
don't you?

04:23.950 --> 04:25.716
- They were left at the road
by the Apocalypse.

04:25.816 --> 04:27.216
- Do you have
inside information?

04:27.350 --> 04:28.550
- Yes! The theme has changed.

04:28.650 --> 04:30.650
It's now
come as your favorite emoji.

04:30.750 --> 04:32.816
emojies!

04:32.916 --> 04:35.983
But the poop emoji's banned,
so don't pick that one.

04:36.083 --> 04:37.683
- It's phenomenal.

04:37.783 --> 04:41.716
Try it, try it, try it, try it.

04:41.816 --> 04:43.250
- Who doesn't like smoothies?

04:43.350 --> 04:44.183
What is she?

04:44.350 --> 04:46.650
An alien?

04:46.750 --> 04:48.383
- Wouldn't you go
to the dance with me?

04:48.483 --> 04:50.416
Uh, no can do.

04:50.516 --> 04:52.150
Sorry, gotta go.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.050
Try it, try it.

04:56.850 --> 04:58.683
Warning,
circuits compromised.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.094
- Why did you drink that?

05:19.153 --> 05:21.153
You know you can't
get wet or eat food.

05:21.253 --> 05:24.953
Spit it out!

05:25.053 --> 05:26.919
Ooh, you knew
what could happen.

05:27.019 --> 05:28.519
Why did you do it?

05:30.386 --> 05:31.586
Moisture eliminated.

05:31.753 --> 05:33.186
Circuits cleared.

05:33.286 --> 05:35.119
- I have no logical answer.

05:35.219 --> 05:37.753
I declined the smoothie,
but everyone continued to shout,

05:37.819 --> 05:40.386
"Try it, try it."

05:40.486 --> 05:43.019
I felt compelled to comply
even though I knew the risk.

05:43.119 --> 05:45.219
Perhaps it was
a circuit malfunction.

05:45.319 --> 05:46.586
- It wasn't a malfunction.

05:46.753 --> 05:48.786
It was a simple case
of peer pressure.

05:48.886 --> 05:50.753
- Social pressure by members
of one's peer group

05:50.786 --> 05:52.786
to take a certain action
in order to be accepted?

05:52.886 --> 05:54.819
- Basically... exactly.

05:54.919 --> 05:58.986
Peer pressure is a normal thing
to feel... for humans.

05:59.086 --> 06:01.353
- Dayton Reyes, I am changing.

06:01.453 --> 06:03.986
- I know, and that's so great.

06:04.086 --> 06:06.753
But you need to be careful and
not do thing that'll hurt you,

06:06.853 --> 06:08.919
no matter how much
peer pressure you feel.

06:09.019 --> 06:10.819
Next time, come to me.

06:10.919 --> 06:12.753
I'll help defuse the situation.

06:12.786 --> 06:14.653
- You help me so much,
Dayton Reyes.

06:14.753 --> 06:17.853
- I think I might be able
to help you even more.

06:17.953 --> 06:21.519
What would you say if I told you
you could eat food

06:21.619 --> 06:24.819
without causing
a catastrophic system failure?

06:26.286 --> 06:27.319
- Oh, hi, girls.

06:27.419 --> 06:30.253
Congratulations on Brain Squad.

06:30.353 --> 06:32.986
And nice work putting in
those new vocal chords.

06:33.086 --> 06:34.319
- Thank you, Mom.

06:34.419 --> 06:37.219
- Dr. Gaines, do you know
anything about E-stomachs?

06:37.319 --> 06:40.219
- Do you mean a machine
that uses bacteria to break down

06:40.319 --> 06:42.353
and derive power
from organic material?

06:42.453 --> 06:43.753
I know quite a bit.

06:43.819 --> 06:46.919
I'm actually pretty close
to finalizing a prototype.

06:47.019 --> 06:48.353
- Will you install it in me now?

06:48.453 --> 06:52.186
- Oh, Frankie, I need to do
more experiments

06:52.286 --> 06:54.886
before I'd feel confident
installing it in you.

06:54.986 --> 06:58.019
- But, Dr. Gaines,
if Frankie could eat, there'd be

06:58.119 --> 07:00.819
way less chance of someone
finding out she's an android.

07:00.919 --> 07:02.986
And Frankie and I could help

07:03.086 --> 07:04.453
with the rest
of the experiments.

07:04.553 --> 07:05.986
We could use
the chem lab at school.

07:06.086 --> 07:07.853
- Great idea.

07:07.953 --> 07:09.319
- Thank you, Dr. Gaines.

07:09.419 --> 07:10.953
I'm gonna go home and study up.

07:11.053 --> 07:12.919
See ya tomorrow, Frankie.

07:13.019 --> 07:14.786
- I like her.

07:14.886 --> 07:15.819
- Me, too.

07:15.919 --> 07:16.953
I also like Cole Reyes.

07:17.053 --> 07:20.186
- Oh, now, Frankie,
we talked about this.

07:20.286 --> 07:22.753
Spending time with Cole
is just too dangerous.

07:22.819 --> 07:24.786
There are so many things
that could go wrong.

07:24.886 --> 07:26.486
I'm sorry, I can't allow it.

07:26.586 --> 07:28.419
- But your reasoning
is not logical.

07:28.519 --> 07:30.019
You created me as an experiment.

07:30.119 --> 07:32.619
By definition, a course
of action tentatively adopted

07:32.753 --> 07:34.453
without being sure
of the eventual outcome.

07:34.553 --> 07:36.919
- That doesn't mean we need
to take unnecessary risks.

07:37.019 --> 07:39.186
- But if you were trying
to control the outcome,

07:39.286 --> 07:40.653
isn't your experiment corrupted?

07:40.753 --> 07:45.786
- Well... when you put it
that way, okay, you're right.

07:45.886 --> 07:49.319
As a scientist, I shouldn't be
trying to control your life.

07:49.419 --> 07:52.753
But as your mother,
I do it because I love you

07:52.786 --> 07:54.953
and I don't want anything
to happen to you.

07:55.053 --> 07:55.886
Do you understand?

07:55.986 --> 07:57.219
- I do, Mom.

07:57.319 --> 08:00.153
But let me ask Dr. Gaines.

08:00.253 --> 08:01.253
May I spend time with Cole?

08:01.353 --> 08:03.086
- Okay.

08:03.186 --> 08:04.653
But promise you'll be careful.

08:04.753 --> 08:07.353
You cannot ever let him know
you're an android.

08:07.453 --> 08:08.753
- I understand.

08:08.819 --> 08:10.986
- And remind me never to try
and out logic a computer.

08:11.086 --> 08:12.019
- Reminder set.

08:16.486 --> 08:19.319
Frankie is an alien,
I'm sure of it.

08:19.419 --> 08:21.586
- Tammy, when I said,
"What is she? An alien?"

08:21.753 --> 08:22.886
I didn't mean it literally.

08:22.986 --> 08:24.253
- It was a figure of speak.

08:24.353 --> 08:26.286
She said that because
she couldn't even imagine

08:26.386 --> 08:28.186
a human teenager
who didn't like smoothies.

08:28.286 --> 08:29.753
- I know why she said it.

08:29.786 --> 08:32.153
- And besides, she did end up
trying the smoothie in the end.

08:32.253 --> 08:33.986
- And then she ran off
to the bathroom,

08:34.086 --> 08:36.086
where she definitely
spit it out.

08:36.186 --> 08:37.219
Think about it.

08:37.318 --> 08:39.285
Have you ever seen Frankie eat?

08:39.385 --> 08:41.553
She wouldn't drink the smoothie
because she can't.

08:41.653 --> 08:44.253
She probably doesn't even have
a digestive system.

08:44.353 --> 08:46.753
Frankie Gaines is an alien.

08:48.453 --> 08:50.219
- Dayton Reyes,
it's tomorrow and I see you.

08:50.319 --> 08:51.386
And I have excellent news.

08:51.486 --> 08:53.586
My mom agreed
to let me see Cole.

08:53.753 --> 08:55.919
Now he and I will be able
to go to the dance together.

08:56.019 --> 08:57.753
Did you know there's a dance
called the robot?

08:57.786 --> 09:00.386
- That's awesome,
but we have a major problem.

09:00.486 --> 09:01.619
Tammy knows about you.

09:01.753 --> 09:03.119
She thinks you're an alien.

09:03.219 --> 09:04.253
- Why is that a problem?

09:04.353 --> 09:05.253
She isn't correct.

09:05.353 --> 09:06.419
I'm not an alien.

09:06.519 --> 09:08.119
- Yeah, but she knows
you're not human.

09:08.219 --> 09:09.786
That's just as bad.

09:09.886 --> 09:11.453
We have to convince Tammy
that you're human.

09:11.553 --> 09:14.086
- I am a robot doing the robot.

09:14.186 --> 09:15.619
- Please stop that.

09:15.753 --> 09:17.853
- Won't going to the dance make
Tammy believe that I'm human?

09:17.953 --> 09:19.486
- Not necessarily.

09:19.586 --> 09:21.986
But eating might.

09:22.086 --> 09:25.086
We need to get that E-stomach
finished ASAP.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.253
- Perfecting an E-stomach
is gonna be

09:32.353 --> 09:33.819
a piece of cake
compared to boys.

09:33.919 --> 09:36.653
- Yes, perfecting a boy would
be difficult and time-consuming.

09:38.053 --> 09:40.153
Figuring out how to get them
to ask you to the dance

09:40.253 --> 09:41.186
is even harder.

09:41.286 --> 09:42.619
- You're referring to Byron.

09:42.753 --> 09:44.219
I don't understand
why you don't ask him

09:44.319 --> 09:45.553
to go to the dance with you.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.519
I'm going to ask Cole.
- I can't do that.

09:47.619 --> 09:49.286
What if he says no?

09:49.386 --> 09:50.919
I'd be so embarrassed.

09:51.019 --> 09:53.419
It's definitely safer
to just wait for him to ask me.

09:53.519 --> 09:54.686
- Why would he say no?

09:54.786 --> 09:57.553
We determined that Byron
like likes you.

09:57.653 --> 09:59.353
- That was last week.

09:59.453 --> 10:01.986
What if he doesn't
like like me anymore?

10:02.086 --> 10:03.486
Things change, you know?

10:03.586 --> 10:05.753
- Does that mean that Cole
might not like like me anymore?

10:05.853 --> 10:07.753
- No, of course not.
Why would you think that?

10:07.853 --> 10:10.853
- I didn't until
you said that about Byron.

10:10.953 --> 10:12.153
The solution is clear.

10:12.253 --> 10:13.619
Ask Byron if he like likes you.

10:13.719 --> 10:15.486
If he says yes, then you can
confidently ask him

10:15.586 --> 10:17.653
to go to the dance with you.
- I can't do that!

10:17.753 --> 10:19.519
People don't just go around

10:19.619 --> 10:21.953
asking boys
if they like like you.

10:22.053 --> 10:23.419
It's just not done.

10:23.519 --> 10:25.253
- I have much to learn.

10:25.353 --> 10:26.353
Then what will you do?

10:26.453 --> 10:30.386
- I guess I'll just...

10:30.486 --> 10:33.286
put on my big girl pants
and ask him.

10:33.386 --> 10:35.419
And you should
definitely ask Cole.

10:35.519 --> 10:37.119
- Another thing
I need to learn.

10:37.219 --> 10:39.219
Where does one get
big girl pants?

10:40.953 --> 10:45.353
- I did some research,
this could be really bad.

10:45.453 --> 10:47.919
She could be carrying
alien disease microbes

10:48.019 --> 10:51.953
that could wipe out
the entire human species.

10:52.053 --> 10:55.253
I suggest you follow my lead and
immediately get one of these.

10:55.353 --> 10:57.486
- Oooh, nice one.

11:01.086 --> 11:02.353
- There's Tammy, act normal.

11:02.453 --> 11:03.819
- That is not
one of my settings.

11:03.919 --> 11:05.419
- Okay, definitely don't talk
about your settings.

11:05.519 --> 11:08.886
Just do what I do.

11:08.986 --> 11:10.219
Frankie, no, stop it.

11:10.319 --> 11:12.419
You're making it so much worse.

11:12.519 --> 11:14.453
- Wait, you said...
- Never mind.

11:14.553 --> 11:16.019
She's gone now anyways.

11:18.519 --> 11:19.886
What are you doing?

11:19.986 --> 11:22.019
- Trying to determine if you're
wearing your big girl pants.

11:22.119 --> 11:23.319
Byron is there.

11:23.419 --> 11:25.619
Now would be an excellent time
to ask him to the dance.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.919
- Cole is with him! I don't
think it's the right time.

11:29.553 --> 11:31.619
- There's Dayton, go ask her.

11:31.753 --> 11:34.586
- I don't know, Cole, maybe
this isn't the right time.

11:34.753 --> 11:36.819
- Yeah, it is, good luck.

11:36.919 --> 11:37.753
- Cole is leaving.

11:37.786 --> 11:40.453
Now you have no more excuses.

11:40.553 --> 11:41.486
- Wish me luck.

11:41.586 --> 11:43.153
- Good luck, Dayton Reyes.

11:45.953 --> 11:47.086
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:47.186 --> 11:48.786
Uh, good luck for what?

11:48.886 --> 11:50.319
- Oh, nothing.

11:50.419 --> 11:52.553
You know, Frankie,
she's just such a kidder.

11:52.653 --> 11:54.386
- Yeah, she's funny.

11:54.486 --> 11:55.953
So...

11:56.053 --> 11:57.319
- So, how's it going?

11:57.419 --> 11:58.653
- Uh, alright.

11:58.753 --> 12:00.319
How's it going with you?

12:00.419 --> 12:02.453
- Great.
Yeah, yeah, really great.

12:02.553 --> 12:04.153
- I was wondering...
- I was going to...

12:04.253 --> 12:05.419
- You were?
- You do?

12:05.519 --> 12:07.253
- Do you wanna go
to the dance with me?

12:07.353 --> 12:08.386
- Yes! That would be great.

12:08.486 --> 12:09.986
I was just going to ask you.

12:10.086 --> 12:12.353
- Great.
- Awesome.

12:12.453 --> 12:14.353
- See ya later.
- Bye.

12:19.753 --> 12:21.019
- Hello, Cole Reyes.

12:21.119 --> 12:22.986
- Frankie, aren't you
supposed to stay away from me?

12:23.086 --> 12:24.419
- Not any longer.

12:24.519 --> 12:26.553
My mom said it was acceptable
for us to spend time together.

12:26.653 --> 12:27.819
- Really? That's great.

12:27.919 --> 12:29.219
- I know.

12:29.319 --> 12:31.286
And Dayton Reyes said I should
feel weird about asking you

12:31.386 --> 12:33.753
to the dance, but I do not.

12:33.819 --> 12:36.753
So, Cole Reyes, do you wanna
go to the dance with me?

12:36.786 --> 12:40.386
- Frankie Gaines, I would love
to go to the dance with you.

12:40.486 --> 12:42.319
- I like like you, Cole Reyes.

12:45.353 --> 12:47.753
- Yes!

12:47.786 --> 12:48.653
- Think!

12:48.753 --> 12:50.186
How do we make Frankie a menace?

12:50.286 --> 12:53.353
What could she do that would
really freak people out?

12:53.453 --> 12:55.186
Nuclear annihilation.

12:55.286 --> 12:56.453
Nah, it's too much work.

12:56.553 --> 12:58.186
Besides, I just wanna
plant seeds of doubt

12:58.286 --> 13:00.419
in Sigourney's mind,
not destroy humanity.

13:00.519 --> 13:01.753
What if I get caught?

13:01.786 --> 13:02.753
I could go to jail.

13:02.819 --> 13:03.886
I'd never survive jail.

13:03.986 --> 13:05.619
It'd be like middle school
all over again.

13:05.753 --> 13:06.819
But with dangerous criminals.

13:06.919 --> 13:08.619
- I have a plan.
- You do?

13:08.753 --> 13:10.353
What is it? Tell me.
No, don't tell me.

13:10.453 --> 13:11.753
Okay, fine, tell me.

13:11.853 --> 13:13.753
But if we get caught,
I'm throwing you under the bus.

13:13.819 --> 13:14.753
- We won't get caught.

13:14.853 --> 13:16.219
You programmed me
better than that.

13:16.319 --> 13:17.753
- I did, didn't I?

13:17.853 --> 13:18.919
Mm.

13:19.019 --> 13:20.119
Okay.

13:20.219 --> 13:23.553
First,
I'll break into the lockers.

13:23.653 --> 13:26.153
Then, I'll have some fun.

13:36.004 --> 13:38.571
- This dance is gonna be epic.

13:38.671 --> 13:39.571
- Hey, Cole.

13:39.671 --> 13:40.637
- What's up, Tammy?

13:40.771 --> 13:41.837
- I'm gonna go get Bob.

13:41.937 --> 13:43.671
He's been locked up
in the dark all night.

13:43.771 --> 13:45.437
- I'm pretty sure
inanimate objects

13:45.537 --> 13:46.671
don't mind the dark.

13:46.771 --> 13:50.204
- Why the name calling, Tammy?

13:50.304 --> 13:52.804
- How are you
on this glorious day?

13:52.904 --> 13:55.271
- Wow, you're in a great mood.

13:55.371 --> 13:56.404
- Why shouldn't I be?

13:56.504 --> 13:57.971
It's a beautiful day,
the sun is shining.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.771
I got a B on my last math test.

13:59.871 --> 14:01.771
Thanks for that, by the way.

14:01.871 --> 14:03.271
- Glad I could help.

14:03.371 --> 14:06.171
You know, when we team up,
you're unstoppable.

14:06.271 --> 14:07.771
So what do you think
about teaming up

14:07.837 --> 14:08.871
and going to the dance together?

14:08.971 --> 14:10.437
- I already have a date, sorry.

14:10.537 --> 14:11.537
- You do?

14:11.637 --> 14:13.137
With who?
- Frankie.

14:13.237 --> 14:15.437
- I thought she wasn't
allowed to see you.

14:15.537 --> 14:17.437
- She wasn't, but now she is.

14:17.537 --> 14:18.637
- Wow.

14:18.771 --> 14:20.271
That's just great.

14:21.671 --> 14:23.437
- I hope you know what
you're getting yourself into.

14:23.537 --> 14:24.871
She's not who you think she is.

14:24.971 --> 14:27.004
- Thanks, Tammy. Gotta go.

14:27.104 --> 14:29.504
- Hey!
I'm not done talking to you.

14:29.604 --> 14:31.671
- We will find who did this.

14:31.771 --> 14:33.104
In the meantime, grab a cat.

14:33.204 --> 14:35.837
Stroke its fur
to calm yourselves.

14:43.071 --> 14:45.537
Breathe, breathe,
Carmen, breathe.

14:45.637 --> 14:47.504
Go to your happy place.

14:53.537 --> 14:58.437
- What kind of animal would do
this to Princess Sparkling Rose?

14:58.537 --> 14:59.771
- Where's Bob?

14:59.804 --> 15:01.271
- Are you sure
you left him in there?

15:01.371 --> 15:03.171
- Yes, I'm sure.
Bob, where are you?

15:08.537 --> 15:11.471
- Okay, now don't panic.

15:11.571 --> 15:13.304
- Bob's foot!

15:14.937 --> 15:16.171
He's been kidnapped.

15:16.271 --> 15:17.837
Do you think
I'll get a ransom note?

15:17.937 --> 15:19.137
I'll pay any price.

15:19.237 --> 15:20.604
- Maybe just build a new one?

15:20.771 --> 15:23.337
- I thought you cared about Bob.

15:23.437 --> 15:26.371
We have suffered
an act of unspeakable violence.

15:26.471 --> 15:28.937
But we will not
let the perpetrators win.

15:29.037 --> 15:30.337
We'll rebuild.

15:30.437 --> 15:35.771
I swear to you, paw to heart,
justice will be served.

15:35.837 --> 15:38.604
- Look at him. He's a wreck.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.204
Bob is his best friend.

15:40.304 --> 15:42.171
I guess I'd feel like that
if you were missing.

15:42.271 --> 15:44.871
- Luckily, I'm too big
to fit in your locker.

15:44.971 --> 15:46.504
- I told you she was dangerous.

15:46.604 --> 15:47.637
- You think Frankie did this?

15:47.771 --> 15:48.904
- Duh.

15:49.004 --> 15:52.771
When are you two gonna wake up
and smell the...

15:52.804 --> 15:54.571
whatever aliens smell like.

15:54.671 --> 15:55.904
You know what I mean.

15:56.004 --> 15:58.771
Didn't you notice that
her locker was untouched?

15:58.804 --> 16:00.304
Doesn't that make you
suspicious?

16:00.404 --> 16:01.971
- Nothing happened
to yours either.

16:02.071 --> 16:04.771
- That's not the same thing
at all.

16:04.871 --> 16:06.137
- Hello, ladies.

16:06.237 --> 16:08.137
In an effort to find
the perfect date for the dance,

16:08.237 --> 16:10.037
I've conducted an online survey.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.004
Please fill it out
at your earliest convenience.

16:17.504 --> 16:19.837
What a joke.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.771
But lucky you, going with Cole.

16:21.837 --> 16:22.904
- I'm not.

16:23.004 --> 16:24.937
He's going with the girl
from outer space.

16:25.037 --> 16:26.771
- Frankie?
- What-evs.

16:26.837 --> 16:29.137
His loss is Andrew's gain.

16:31.537 --> 16:32.471
Andrew?

16:32.571 --> 16:33.671
- Hey, Tam Tam. How's life?

16:33.771 --> 16:35.804
- Super now that you're here.

16:35.904 --> 16:37.237
I was thinking,
wouldn't it be fun

16:37.337 --> 16:39.037
if we went
to the dance together?

16:39.137 --> 16:41.137
- Uh, it would...
- Great.

16:41.237 --> 16:44.637
You can pick me up at...
- But I already have a date.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.771
- You do? With who?

16:46.837 --> 16:48.004
- Frankie.

16:48.104 --> 16:50.771
- No. Cole's going to the dance
with Frankie.

16:50.804 --> 16:52.137
Cole, didn't you say
that you were

16:52.237 --> 16:53.471
going to the dance with Frankie?

16:53.571 --> 16:55.171
- Yeah, she asked me,
and I said yes.

16:55.271 --> 16:56.771
- That's impossible.

16:56.871 --> 16:58.837
Because I asked her,
she said yes.

17:03.469 --> 17:05.169
- It's all over school.

17:05.269 --> 17:07.469
They both say they're going
to the dance with you.

17:07.569 --> 17:10.035
- I can't imagine what could
have given Andrew that idea.

17:10.135 --> 17:12.502
- Playback your memory files
from the last time you saw him.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.469
- It made me think, well...

17:17.535 --> 17:18.569
- Turn up the volume.

17:18.669 --> 17:20.734
- Would you wanna go
to the dance with me?

17:20.835 --> 17:25.234
Uh, is that a yes?

17:25.335 --> 17:26.868
Yes?

17:26.969 --> 17:28.735
Yes?

17:28.835 --> 17:30.469
We're gonna have
such an awesome time together.

17:30.569 --> 17:33.802
- He thought your thumbs up
to me was a thumbs up to him.

17:33.902 --> 17:35.069
What are you gonna do?

17:35.169 --> 17:36.269
- The solution is obvious.

17:36.369 --> 17:38.169
I will just have to go
with both of them.

17:38.269 --> 17:41.269
- Um, I don't think
they're gonna go for that.

17:41.369 --> 17:43.102
You're just gonna have
to break your date with Andrew

17:43.202 --> 17:44.602
and explain
what happened to Cole.

17:44.702 --> 17:46.902
- But I agreed
to go with Andrew,

17:47.002 --> 17:48.602
even if I didn't know I did.

17:48.702 --> 17:50.102
Isn't breaking
an agreement wrong?

17:50.202 --> 17:51.769
- But you also
made an agreement with Cole

17:51.869 --> 17:52.702
when you asked him.

17:52.802 --> 17:54.235
- So in either case,

17:54.335 --> 17:56.669
I will be doing something wrong
to one of them.

17:56.769 --> 17:58.202
I am not programmed
for such a scenario.

17:58.302 --> 17:59.969
- Look, let's figure
this out later.

18:00.069 --> 18:02.035
The last step to getting
this E-stomach up and running

18:02.135 --> 18:03.902
is implanting the bacteria.

18:04.002 --> 18:05.035
It's in my locker.

18:05.135 --> 18:06.569
- I will go get it.

18:09.669 --> 18:10.869
- Ms. Hough,
you wanted to see me?

18:10.969 --> 18:11.902
- Yes, Tammy.

18:12.002 --> 18:13.235
It's been brought
to my attention

18:13.335 --> 18:17.302
that you're a little coo-coo
over aliens among us.

18:17.469 --> 18:19.169
- Lucia and Makayla.

18:19.269 --> 18:21.635
- I don't know if you're aware,
but in addition to being

18:21.735 --> 18:26.502
the school's administrator, I am
also a certified life coach.

18:26.602 --> 18:29.835
Pet Mr. Snuggles while you
tell me all about it.

18:29.935 --> 18:31.469
Listen to him purr.

18:31.535 --> 18:33.335
Isn't it just relaxing?

18:40.269 --> 18:42.769
- Thanks, Ms. Hough,
I'm feeling much better.

18:42.869 --> 18:44.469
Maybe that was
a little ridiculous.

18:44.569 --> 18:45.469
Aliens?

18:45.535 --> 18:46.702
Ha!

18:51.635 --> 18:53.735
- Just doesn't make sense.

18:53.835 --> 18:56.502
Why?

18:56.602 --> 18:57.669
The innocent always suffer.

18:57.769 --> 18:59.235
- Poor Bob.

18:59.335 --> 19:00.469
- Poor Bob?

19:00.502 --> 19:01.502
Poor me.

19:01.602 --> 19:03.369
Why would Frankie
ask me to go to the dance

19:03.469 --> 19:05.769
if she was
already going with Andrew?

19:08.502 --> 19:10.569
- It's Frankie on video chat.
- So answer it.

19:10.669 --> 19:12.735
- Does my hair look stupid?
- It's fine.

19:12.835 --> 19:14.569
- Hey, Frankie.
- Hello, Cole Reyes.

19:14.669 --> 19:15.802
I'm just calling to inform you

19:15.902 --> 19:17.802
that Andrew did in fact
ask me to the dance.

19:17.902 --> 19:19.135
- And you said yes?

19:19.235 --> 19:22.902
- I did not knowingly say yes,
but I did say yes.

19:23.002 --> 19:24.102
It's complicated.

19:24.202 --> 19:25.469
- It'll be easy
to uncomplicated it.

19:25.502 --> 19:27.369
Just tell Andrew
there was a misunderstanding

19:27.469 --> 19:28.869
and you're going to the dance
with me.

19:28.969 --> 19:30.135
- That is logical.

19:30.235 --> 19:31.735
But I'm afraid
it's more complicated than that.

19:31.835 --> 19:34.502
- Do you wanna go with Andrew?
- No, I wanna go with you.

19:34.602 --> 19:36.102
- So tell him.

19:36.202 --> 19:38.535
It's not fair to either of us
if you don't clear this up.

19:38.635 --> 19:40.102
- Mm, I can't.

19:40.202 --> 19:41.935
- Let me know when
you've made up your mind.

19:42.035 --> 19:43.002
I gotta go, bye.

19:44.902 --> 19:46.735
Well, that was awkward.

19:49.569 --> 19:50.902
- Do you feel any different?

19:51.002 --> 19:52.069
- That's a good sign.

19:52.169 --> 19:53.835
The E-stomach
should integrate seamlessly

19:53.935 --> 19:55.202
with your other hardware.

19:55.302 --> 19:58.402
- And for your first ever
meal... my famous pancakes.

19:58.502 --> 20:00.602
- They're famous
for doubling as hockey pucks.

20:00.702 --> 20:03.035
As long as Mom didn't install
any E-taste buds,

20:03.135 --> 20:04.269
you should be good to go.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.269
- Can you program this one
to be more thankful?

20:06.369 --> 20:08.769
- Ready to take
your first bite of real food?

20:17.802 --> 20:19.469
- My system says food accepted.

20:21.102 --> 20:22.235
- Thank you, Mom.

20:22.335 --> 20:23.902
- I couldn't have done it
without you two.

20:24.002 --> 20:25.169
Excellent work.

20:25.269 --> 20:26.435
- Sir, security reports

20:26.535 --> 20:28.569
that the android
containment unit is secure.

20:28.669 --> 20:29.635
- Excellent, excellent.

20:29.735 --> 20:31.369
Activate Droid Sync.

20:33.235 --> 20:33.969
- Well?

20:34.069 --> 20:35.202
Tell me it's working,

20:35.302 --> 20:37.569
or you can all start
filing for unemployment.

20:37.669 --> 20:39.102
- The androids are now synced.

20:39.202 --> 20:41.202
- Oh, this is so exciting.

20:41.302 --> 20:43.369
All we need to do now
is enter a command,

20:43.469 --> 20:45.569
and all of the androids
will obey.

20:45.669 --> 20:48.635
- Oh, well, have the androids
report to this spot.

20:52.969 --> 20:54.335
- So... so now what?

20:54.469 --> 20:56.469
Did the stolen android respond?

20:56.535 --> 20:59.835
- It's got to connect with it,
and then it should respond.

20:59.935 --> 21:02.002
It could take a few moments.

21:04.169 --> 21:05.769
- Remind me again
why we're filling out

21:05.869 --> 21:07.069
Robbie's stupid date survey?

21:07.169 --> 21:08.969
- Because it's entertaining
to goof on.

21:09.069 --> 21:11.769
- I just put down that
my favorite color's plaid.

21:14.202 --> 21:18.102
Okay, fine, I'm hitting send.

21:18.202 --> 21:19.769
Hey, guys,
it's me, Robbie.

21:19.869 --> 21:20.969
The results are in.

21:21.069 --> 21:23.769
My perfect emoji dance date
is Tammy Gilroy.

21:27.735 --> 21:30.835
- Have you told Andrew you're
going to the dance with me yet?

21:30.935 --> 21:33.002
- I have not.

21:33.102 --> 21:34.502
- Now's your chance.

21:34.602 --> 21:35.735
Tell him.

21:35.835 --> 21:37.769
- Please do not tell me
what do to, Cole Reyes.

21:37.869 --> 21:38.735
- Tell me what?

21:45.369 --> 21:46.535
- Frankie.

21:46.635 --> 21:48.602
Frankie!

21:48.702 --> 21:50.235
Where are you going?

21:54.002 --> 21:55.202
- I was wrong.

21:55.302 --> 21:56.802
Frankie's not an alien.

21:56.902 --> 21:58.469
- Of course she's not.

21:58.569 --> 21:59.835
- She's a robot.
