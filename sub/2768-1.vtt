How much do you want, Daddy?

01:56.450 --> 01:57.702
Twenty time.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.375
Fifty?
Yeah, 50.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.917
D'ya hear Rock Hudson
was a cock sucker?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.173
Where d'ya hear that shit?

02:07.294 --> 02:11.549
It's called a newspaper. Right there.
It's a shame, ain't it?

02:11.923 --> 02:15.393
All that fine Hollywood
pussy just all being wasted

02:15.844 --> 02:18.017
on a guy who smokes
his fucking friends.

02:21.224 --> 02:24.444
Rog, this ain't the sandbox.
Twenty minimum. C'mon.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.317
Shit. God damn.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.899
Cheap son of a bitch.
I'm tryin'.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.410
I got it, I got it.

02:31.568 --> 02:34.071
Who the hell's
Rock Hudson anyway?

02:36.531 --> 02:39.831
He's an actor, dumb-ass! You
ever seen <i>North by Northwest?</i>

02:44.081 --> 02:47.381
<i>Hey, I've got a question for
everybody, who wants to bull ride? Hey!</i>

02:49.336 --> 02:50.679
<i>One more time, make some noise!</i>

02:50.837 --> 02:52.180
<i>Clap your hands,
stomp your feet!</i>

02:52.255 --> 02:55.008
<i>It's bull ride time!
Let's bull ride!</i>

02:56.927 --> 03:00.101
<i>You're sitting there at America's
number one spectator event.</i>

03:00.180 --> 03:02.603
<i>The spills, the thrills,
the bumps, the bruises.</i>

03:02.683 --> 03:08.031
<i>It's all pan' of America's number
one spectator event, bull riding!</i>

03:10.774 --> 03:11.821
All right.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.450
Calm the nerves, brother.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.246
This is your day,
I can feel it.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.203
Shit, I don't know, Ron.
Well, I do.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.539
Eight seconds,
and look at this. Hey! Hey!

03:25.622 --> 03:29.547
$640, all right? You do that,
and you're going to get blown

03:29.626 --> 03:31.299
by a hundred dollar
hooker before you can

03:31.378 --> 03:33.472
scrape the bull shit
off your boots, brother.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.682
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.477
Eat that motherfucker!
Mmm?

03:49.896 --> 03:52.149
<i>Clap your hands, stomp your
feet, make some noise!</i>

03:52.232 --> 03:54.576
<i>It's bull ride time!</i>

03:54.651 --> 03:55.743
Ready?

03:56.403 --> 03:57.996
<i>Nine to five,
come on, make some noise!</i>

03:58.113 --> 03:59.285
Yeah!

04:02.951 --> 04:04.168
Four one thousand.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.173
Fuck!

04:08.331 --> 04:10.129
My God!

04:23.680 --> 04:24.681
Hold it!

04:24.806 --> 04:26.353
You get back here,
you motherfucker!

04:26.516 --> 04:28.018
Everyone get with
that man, c'mon!

04:31.354 --> 04:34.699
Tucker!
I need you to arrest me!

04:34.816 --> 04:36.113
Fuck off, Woodroof!

04:36.276 --> 04:37.528
C'mon man! No shit!

04:37.611 --> 04:39.363
Looks like you got a bunch
of pissed off customers.

04:39.488 --> 04:40.489
Fuck you!
You gonna cuff me or not?

04:40.572 --> 04:41.744
No! Figure it out yourself.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.461
Son of a bitch!

04:47.537 --> 04:50.962
C'mon! Back off!
Or I'll arrest all of you!

04:52.125 --> 04:53.217
Son of a bitch!

04:56.546 --> 05:00.642
They're gonna kick the shit outta
you someday, Woodroof. Maybe worse.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.729
Yeah,
you gotta die somehow.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.236
Handle your business, huh?

05:15.899 --> 05:17.242
Get your shit together.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.655
Shit, Tuck, you're starting to
sound like a goddamn old man.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.825
How's he doing anyway?

05:27.369 --> 05:29.087
There's good days and bad.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.502
Oh, he's a tough old outlaw.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.712
Just can't imagine
how disappointed he must be

05:36.795 --> 05:38.468
in having a cop for a son.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.599
Get the fuck outta my car.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.012
Thanks for the lift, man.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.432
Fuck!
You okay?

05:54.104 --> 05:55.447
You rattled my brain.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.567
What brain?

06:46.615 --> 06:48.458
Arright, Clinto,

06:48.533 --> 06:51.503
that shit is purer than a preacher's
daughter's pussy right there.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.297
Not after you've just coughed
your lungs all over it.

06:55.498 --> 06:56.920
One dollar.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.836
I got your dollar.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.298
There we go.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.851
Hey, you thinking anymore
about Saudi Arabia?

07:05.967 --> 07:07.184
They need guys over there.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.770
Fuck, no.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.849
Why d'you wanna go work for a bunch
of sand niggers anyway, huh?

07:12.807 --> 07:15.651
'Cause they pay five times
as much, that's why.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.692
Mmm-hmm. That's right.
I'm signing up.

07:22.025 --> 07:23.527
They got hot ass over there?

07:23.610 --> 07:26.113
It's a Muslim country.
Can't fuck the women.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.581
That takes me right out, then.

07:28.657 --> 07:31.456
Woodroof! There's been
an accident on platform 5.

07:31.534 --> 07:32.956
They need an
electrician right away.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.333
Yes, sir!

07:34.454 --> 07:36.798
All right, check ya later.
All right.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.467
Adios! Get to work,
lazy fucker!

07:39.542 --> 07:42.341
Let me see that
preacher's daughter's pussy.

07:44.506 --> 07:47.885
Dumbass spic. How'd ya get
your leg in there?

07:48.176 --> 07:49.223
Ambulance coming?

07:49.803 --> 07:51.305
He's illegal.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.351
Call a fucking ambulance.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.563
Call it!
Fuck!

08:00.730 --> 08:02.653
I need an ambulance.
I'mma shut it down.

08:03.858 --> 08:08.910
Platform 5, ASAP. There's a man down.
Repeat, man down.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.873
His leg's caught in the drill.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.693
Mr. Woodroof?

08:45.066 --> 08:47.034
I see you found our stash!

08:48.278 --> 08:49.746
I'm Dr. Sevard.

08:50.613 --> 08:53.537
Why don't you go ahead
and hop up here for me,

08:53.616 --> 08:55.118
if you don't mind.
Thank you.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.753
I like your shoes.

09:01.958 --> 09:07.636
We saw something which concerned
us on your initial blood work,

09:07.714 --> 09:09.466
so we ran some
additional tests.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.392
Some blood tests.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.470
What kind of blood tests?

09:15.055 --> 09:16.056
I don't use drugs.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.813
We didn't test
your blood for drugs.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.819
Well good. 'Cause it ain't
any y'all business anyway.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.317
That's right.

09:26.483 --> 09:27.484
Um...

09:28.902 --> 09:34.159
You've tested positive for HIV.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.494
Which is the virus
that causes AIDS.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.340
You fucking kidding me?

09:42.749 --> 09:47.425
Telling me that fucking Rock
cock sucking Hudson bullshit?

09:47.504 --> 09:51.259
Mr. Woodroof, have you ever
used intravenous drugs?

09:51.341 --> 09:53.764
Have you ever engaged
in homosexual conduct?

09:53.843 --> 09:55.265
Homo? Did you say homo?

09:55.345 --> 09:56.642
Yep! That's what
you said isn't it?

09:57.097 --> 10:00.021
Shit, you fucking kidding me?

10:00.141 --> 10:02.109
I ain't no faggot,
motherfucker!

10:02.185 --> 10:04.529
I don't even know
no fucking faggots.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.107
Look at me.
What d'you see, huh?

10:07.190 --> 10:09.363
The goddamn rodeo's
what you see!

10:11.236 --> 10:13.238
Mr. Woodroof.
A'ight, so fucking watch it.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.369
Mr. Woodroof,
could you just...

10:15.448 --> 10:19.203
No, I can't do shit, you speak
fucking English, motherfucker.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.628
Call me a motherfucking faggot.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.130
I'll whip your
fucking ass, boy.

10:22.205 --> 10:24.799
Your T-cell count
is down to nine.

10:24.874 --> 10:28.128
A healthy person has
between 500 and 1,500.

10:29.212 --> 10:32.216
So frankly, we're surprised
you're even alive.

10:34.551 --> 10:38.055
Surprise is, you made
a fucking mistake.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.981
Must have mixed up
my blood samples

10:40.056 --> 10:41.273
with some daisy puller
or something,

10:41.349 --> 10:42.475
'cause that shit ain't me.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.903
We ran the blood test
several times.

10:45.019 --> 10:47.488
Here's some information
about HIV and AIDS

10:47.564 --> 10:48.611
that you might
find informative,

10:48.690 --> 10:50.692
and these are
your test results.

10:55.738 --> 10:59.208
Mr. Woodroof, if you could
listen to me for a moment.

11:01.369 --> 11:02.746
I know this can be
a very scary thing,

11:02.829 --> 11:05.082
I know you're probably feeling
overwhelmed right now,

11:05.165 --> 11:09.090
but we would like to impress upon
you the gravity of your situation.

11:09.210 --> 11:13.340
Based on your health, on your
condition, on all the evidence we have,

11:13.423 --> 11:17.428
we estimate you have 30 days left
to put your affairs in order.

11:29.272 --> 11:31.240
Thirty days?

11:32.609 --> 11:34.782
I'm sorry.

11:37.614 --> 11:40.743
Fuck this.
This is shit.

11:41.951 --> 11:45.876
Fucking 30 day motherfuckers. Let
me give y'all a little newsflash.

11:45.955 --> 11:49.129
There ain't nothing out there that
can kill Ron Woodroof in 30 days.

13:33.062 --> 13:36.236
Shit, damn doctor
cut your balls off?

13:36.316 --> 13:41.573
Shit, tell 'em you got a cold,
man, they give you two weeks off.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.247
You should try it.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.743
Well, you didn't
miss nothing at work.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.836
Shit, I'd take
disability any day.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.916
I tell them I got
a fucking cough,

13:53.041 --> 13:57.763
and they tell me I got some
kind of HIV virus. Shit.

13:58.004 --> 14:01.178
Fuck. Like I got AIDS.

14:03.009 --> 14:06.684
Fucking hospitals man,
mixed up my blood samples.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.561
Shit. I went to
the doctor's one time,

14:08.639 --> 14:09.811
and they tell me
I had chlamydia.

14:09.891 --> 14:12.019
I get back home,
I had fucking crabs.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.274
It's what the fuck
I'm saying, man.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.193
You tell 'em you
got a headache,

14:16.356 --> 14:18.108
they tell ya
you got brain cancer.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.114
Mmm-hmm. Shit, I hear
you can get that

14:20.193 --> 14:23.447
just by touching someone,
or queers get it.

14:23.780 --> 14:24.781
Fucking faggots.

14:24.906 --> 14:27.955
That's it,
exactly why it's a mistake.

14:30.078 --> 14:32.672
Well, what if it ain't?

14:33.373 --> 14:34.795
What if what ain't?

14:35.625 --> 14:37.047
A mistake.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.265
Fucker.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.644
Shit, I know you got a pussy
addiction, motherfucker.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.065
Yeah.

14:52.141 --> 14:55.270
Hey, Salt, hello, Pepper.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.313
God damn.

14:57.939 --> 14:58.940
Mmm.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.740
We going?

15:04.320 --> 15:05.913
Yeah, we going.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.497
Hey, you wanna take
these ladies for a twirl?

15:09.659 --> 15:11.832
You all head out man, I'm good.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.538
I'll catch up with
you all, all right?

15:13.621 --> 15:15.919
Yeah? You all right, brother?
You cool?

15:15.998 --> 15:17.045
I'm cool.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.877
All right. See you there.

15:18.960 --> 15:22.590
All right, see ya in a little
bit, Miss Alaska, Miss Louisiana.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.424
Bye, cowboy.

15:48.990 --> 15:52.085
Azidothymidine, or AZT,
was originally developed

15:52.160 --> 15:53.878
as a treatment for cancer.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.043
With the onset of HIV, however,

15:56.205 --> 15:58.128
we at Avonex Industries
began a trial,

15:58.207 --> 16:01.802
in which we administered AZT
to infected lab animals.

16:01.878 --> 16:05.473
Initial findings suggested
increased CD4 counts,

16:05.548 --> 16:06.970
restored T-cell immunity...

16:07.049 --> 16:09.768
Isn't it also the case
that there were some

16:09.844 --> 16:12.723
troubling side effects
with the animal tests?

16:13.055 --> 16:17.731
Significant decreases in the red and
white blood cells in the animals?

16:17.852 --> 16:19.820
Yes, but its effect
on the virus

16:19.896 --> 16:21.739
is better than anything
else that's been tested.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.567
Well, in '64, when AZT was
developed as a cancer treatment,

16:24.650 --> 16:28.655
it was shelved clue to lack of
anti-cancer efficacy and toxicity.

16:28.738 --> 16:29.739
Right.

16:29.864 --> 16:32.743
We believe those problems
were dosage based.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.578
So, you're gonna conduct
another animal study?

16:35.661 --> 16:37.413
Actually, the FDA's
given us permission

16:37.580 --> 16:39.253
to go straight to human trials.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.046
Which is what
brings me here today.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.469
We're conducting
a double-blind,

16:43.544 --> 16:45.137
placebo-controlled
randomized trial

16:45.421 --> 16:47.014
throughout the United States.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.592
Dallas Mercy is one
of the proposed sites.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.594
How long do you see
the trial going on?

16:51.677 --> 16:54.851
We're hoping to fast track it.
Within a year?

16:56.015 --> 16:57.358
During which time, the hospital

16:57.517 --> 16:58.860
and its
administering physicians

16:58.935 --> 17:01.859
will be very well compensated
for their efforts.

17:02.772 --> 17:05.945
Sadly, the AIDS crisis will only
get worse before it gets better.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.819
And I know I speak for
everyone at Avonex when I say

17:08.944 --> 17:11.289
this is a unique opportunity.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.951
A chance to be on the
forefront in finding a cure.

17:19.288 --> 17:20.790
Does it not drive you
just a little bit crazy

17:20.873 --> 17:22.671
to see these guys talking
about curing the sick

17:22.750 --> 17:24.548
when they flash
their gold Rolexes?

17:24.669 --> 17:26.387
What do they know about
treating a sick patient?

17:26.462 --> 17:28.635
Hey, they're big pharma
reps, they're not doctors.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.968
And like it or not,
this is a business.

17:32.093 --> 17:34.061
How'd they get permission to
go straight to human trial?

17:34.136 --> 17:36.230
People are desperate.
People are dying.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.437
There's nothing else out there.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.495
Fuck!

18:49.545 --> 18:51.047
I need to see Dr. Sevard.

18:51.213 --> 18:52.635
Dr. Sevard's not here today.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.558
I can't wait 'til tomorrow.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.305
If you tell me what the problem
is, maybe I can help you.

18:58.387 --> 19:01.140
You want a list of
my problems, huh?

19:01.223 --> 19:03.317
My lungs are bleeding,
my skin's crawling,

19:03.392 --> 19:05.144
I got a fucking
jackhammer in my head,

19:05.227 --> 19:07.400
and that's the least of
my fucking problems, lady.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.982
Mr. Woodroof?

19:09.065 --> 19:12.160
No. No, no, no, no.
I don't want a nurse.

19:12.234 --> 19:15.864
I want a doctor. I want
a goddamn doctor now.

19:16.906 --> 19:19.329
Well, how can I help you?

19:19.408 --> 19:21.251
You fucking deaf, lady?
Hmm?

19:21.327 --> 19:22.920
No, I'm a fucking doctor!

19:26.707 --> 19:28.675
If you want to discuss
your list of problems,

19:28.751 --> 19:31.595
you can meet me in my office
in 20 minutes.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.130
Okay?

19:40.429 --> 19:43.023
I like your style, Doc!

19:57.947 --> 19:59.324
M r. Woodroof.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.284
Can you get me AZT?

20:03.160 --> 20:06.915
Avonex Industries say they've
just released it for testing.

20:10.418 --> 20:12.341
I wanna buy some.

20:12.420 --> 20:13.967
Now.

20:14.839 --> 20:16.466
That isn't how it works.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.593
For about a year,
a group of patients

20:18.676 --> 20:20.724
gets either the drug
or a placebo.

20:21.679 --> 20:22.896
It's totally left up to chance,

20:22.972 --> 20:24.724
not even doctors
are allowed to know.

20:26.767 --> 20:29.941
So, you're giving
dying people sugar pills?

20:30.020 --> 20:32.648
It's the only way to
know if a drug works.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.657
Can you get some for me?

20:38.028 --> 20:39.575
I got cash.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.960
I can go a month, a week,
however you want to do it.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.411
I hear you.

20:45.494 --> 20:46.996
Unfortunately, no.

20:48.122 --> 20:50.875
But when the drug
is proven to work,

20:51.041 --> 20:53.794
and if you fit the
profile, then yes.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.381
So, you're tellin' me
I'm as good as a horse

20:57.548 --> 20:59.550
being sold for dog food, huh?

21:04.597 --> 21:05.849
Okay.

21:07.516 --> 21:11.521
Look here, how 'bout this
stuff overseas, huh?

21:12.396 --> 21:16.242
Germany, they got this
Dextran Sulfate, a'ight?

21:16.358 --> 21:18.076
And they got
this DDC in France,

21:18.235 --> 21:19.953
supposed to keep
the healthy cells you got

21:20.029 --> 21:22.407
from getting the HIV.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.709
And they got
AL721 over in Israel.

21:25.159 --> 21:26.627
How can I get some of this?

21:26.702 --> 21:28.830
None of those drugs have
been approved by the FDA.

21:28.913 --> 21:31.086
Screw the FDA.

21:31.165 --> 21:33.384
I'm gonna be DOA.

21:33.459 --> 21:36.713
I gotta sue the hospital
to get my medicine?

21:36.796 --> 21:40.642
Mr. Woodroof, I assure you that that
would be a waste of your precious time.

21:44.345 --> 21:48.851
There is a support group that
meets daily in Draddy Auditorium.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.027
I suggest you try it out

21:52.102 --> 21:54.355
and maybe go talk about your
feelings, your concerns.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.156
I'm dying.

21:59.902 --> 22:02.951
You telling me to go get a
hug from a bunch of faggots?

22:09.912 --> 22:11.004
Good day.

22:23.509 --> 22:24.761
Hey, Neddie Jay!

22:24.844 --> 22:26.687
Gimme a shot of cactus
and a Bud back.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.311
God damn.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.440
Hard to say how much
I missed y'alls ugly mugs.

22:34.603 --> 22:37.777
Hey, say Clinto, where are you
hanging your pants these days?

22:41.569 --> 22:43.663
Get me another beer
will you, sweetheart?

22:45.489 --> 22:46.741
Fuck you say?

22:48.367 --> 22:51.120
I said grab me a cold
one, sugarcakes.

22:56.125 --> 22:58.503
You looking to
get your ass kicked?

22:59.253 --> 23:02.052
Nah, I don't want none of
that faggot blood on me.

23:02.673 --> 23:05.301
Hey, Ron, c'mon! God damn it!
Fucker!

23:06.176 --> 23:07.803
Hey, c'mon. We don't want
any trouble, all right?

23:07.887 --> 23:10.515
It's that motherfucker
who's got the fucking problem.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.272
The fuck's your problem, huh?

23:14.351 --> 23:16.604
Hey, Ron, I don't want
no trouble, all right?

23:27.197 --> 23:29.074
Fuck y'all, man.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.469
Fuck all y'all!

23:45.966 --> 23:48.435
Goddammit, he spit on my face.

23:48.510 --> 23:51.059
You got any soap?
Gimme a towel. C'mon!

23:53.515 --> 23:55.517
Jesus fucking Christ.

23:59.813 --> 24:02.316
So as I stand here tonight,
clinical trials are underway

24:02.399 --> 24:04.618
with an eye toward
fast-tracking AZT

24:04.693 --> 24:07.242
and making it available for the
public as soon as possible.

24:07.321 --> 24:10.996
In short, I'm happy to say that
help may finally be on the way.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.918
How long before
the drug's approved?

24:12.993 --> 24:13.960
Yeah.

24:14.036 --> 24:17.290
The FDA's standard procedure to approve
a new drug is eight to 12 years.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.381
Hey, it's your
first time, right?

24:21.460 --> 24:23.212
Back the fuck off, Tinkerbell.

24:25.673 --> 24:27.801
I'll knock your teeth so
far in your goddamn throat

24:27.883 --> 24:29.851
you're gonna be chewing
through your asshole.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.148
What about
Dextran Sulfate?

24:40.854 --> 24:42.822
We're working
closely with the FDA

24:42.898 --> 24:44.775
to make sure every effort
is made to fast-track...

24:44.858 --> 24:46.701
We don't have time.

24:46.777 --> 24:49.781
It's both our job and the
FDA's to make sure the drug ¡s safe.

24:49.863 --> 24:50.910
We don't
have that long.

24:50.990 --> 24:51.991
We're dead, right?

24:52.074 --> 24:54.372
We're going as
fast as possible, believe me.

25:04.878 --> 25:07.222
Just need to slow it down
a little bit.

25:09.091 --> 25:11.970
Just gimme time to catch
my breath, will you?

25:15.431 --> 25:19.311
I ain't ready to crawl in a corner.
I just ain't fucking ready.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.360
So, you better be
listening, all right?

25:24.440 --> 25:28.866
If I got one fucking
chance, show me a sign.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.786
Just show me a fucking sign.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.780
If you're not gonna look or buy a
dance, you could at least tip me.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.780
Here's $20.

26:12.946 --> 26:15.040
The dance, it ain't for me.

26:16.658 --> 26:19.332
You just keep on
shaking it, he'll see ya.

27:35.404 --> 27:37.202
<i>A beautiful
day in Dallas, Texas.</i>

27:37.281 --> 27:41.582
<i>Just hope you had your coffee. Sunshine today.
It's gonna be mid 80s...</i>

28:04.391 --> 28:06.189
Right here, motherfuckers!

29:07.913 --> 29:10.086
There ain't no more.
They started locking it up.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.917
I got the cash!

29:18.382 --> 29:19.474
Here.

29:22.344 --> 29:23.596
The fuck is this?

29:23.679 --> 29:26.398
In Mexico,
a doctor, he has some.

29:26.473 --> 29:27.770
The fuck is this bullshit?

29:27.849 --> 29:30.193
You don't think I know what
you're fucking doing man? Huh?

29:45.242 --> 29:47.586
<i>Mr. Woodroof?
Ron?</i>

29:49.621 --> 29:50.668
Ron?

29:52.124 --> 29:53.171
Hi.

29:55.794 --> 29:56.841
Beautiful.

29:57.337 --> 30:00.557
You're in the hospital.
You almost died.

30:03.677 --> 30:06.226
I bet that didn't
surprise anybody.

30:09.683 --> 30:10.730
What is that, a smile?

30:11.810 --> 30:13.562
You've had
a blood transfusion.

30:13.687 --> 30:15.530
Mr. Woodroof.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.399
I'm Dr. Sevard.

30:18.483 --> 30:21.362
Yeah. Hey,
I remember you.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.328
I need you to tell me where
you obtained AZT from.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.459
How it got in your blood.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.212
I don't know what
you're talking about.

30:36.418 --> 30:40.048
Dealing in pharmaceutical
drugs is illegal.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.057
Yep.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.482
Get some rest.

30:50.557 --> 30:51.729
Where you goin'?

30:51.808 --> 30:54.527
Hang on a second.
We were just getting somewhere.

30:54.936 --> 30:57.234
Honey, you don't have
the slightest chance.

31:03.445 --> 31:04.822
I'm Rayon.

31:08.492 --> 31:09.869
Congratulations.

31:11.161 --> 31:13.129
Fuck off and go back
to your bed.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.299
Relax, I don't bite.

31:17.626 --> 31:21.676
I guess you're handsome in a Texas
hick, white trash, dumb kinda way.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.725
Get the fuck outta here,

31:25.217 --> 31:28.187
whatever you are, before I
kick you in the fucking face.

31:30.097 --> 31:31.269
God damn.

31:31.348 --> 31:32.520
Fine, be an asshole.

31:39.356 --> 31:40.983
You wanna play cards?

31:47.656 --> 31:48.908
You got cash?

31:55.831 --> 31:57.333
How's that strike your fancy?

31:59.167 --> 32:00.510
You mind if I snuggle?

32:01.503 --> 32:03.756
Stay at the end of the bed.

32:03.880 --> 32:04.927
$10 minimum?

32:07.134 --> 32:08.386
Be my guest.

32:11.346 --> 32:13.940
All right,
Miss Man, what you got?

32:18.061 --> 32:20.905
Full house.
Jacks over threes.

32:25.110 --> 32:28.455
Well, I'd have figured you for queens.
Motherfucker!

32:29.739 --> 32:31.036
Sorry, darlin'.

32:32.701 --> 32:34.294
God damn it.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.629
You all right?
Wait, relax.

32:39.708 --> 32:44.259
Where's it at? I got you,
don't worry, just relax.

32:44.337 --> 32:47.261
Relax. Breathe.
Breathe.

32:47.382 --> 32:49.259
Right there. Right there.
That's it, that's it. Breathe.

32:49.342 --> 32:50.719
Get it. Get it.

32:50.802 --> 32:54.022
I got it. I got it.
That's it.

32:55.223 --> 32:57.146
Here, let me
get you some water.

32:59.269 --> 33:03.445
Here, drink this, darlin'.
Drink this.

33:03.523 --> 33:07.949
Oh, you gotta stay hydrated, or
else your muscles will cramp.

33:10.947 --> 33:12.164
Is that better?

33:13.074 --> 33:14.246
Yeah.

33:16.578 --> 33:19.331
It's better, I got it. It's good.
I'll work that for you.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.672
It's good. It's good.

33:27.047 --> 33:28.594
God, you got nice feet.

33:28.673 --> 33:32.143
Jesus Christ, I'm straight.
All right?

33:41.186 --> 33:43.280
What the fuck
you in here for, anyway?

33:44.481 --> 33:46.074
The AZT trial.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.869
My friend is paying me
to split my dose with him,

33:49.945 --> 33:51.788
that way, we'll both get some.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.704
How much he paying you?

33:57.369 --> 33:59.212
Five grand.
What?

33:59.287 --> 34:01.415
I coulda charged him 20.

34:06.461 --> 34:07.553
Hey!

34:09.839 --> 34:12.592
If I want in,
will you sell me some?

34:16.346 --> 34:18.348
I'm sorry, sweetie.

34:20.141 --> 34:22.188
I can't split my dose
in thirds.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.150
Besides, I made a deal.

34:29.818 --> 34:32.992
Anyone who plays cards like you
ain't got five grand, anyhow.

34:33.112 --> 34:34.911
Yeah, right here.

34:41.413 --> 34:45.509
My Lord, sometimes you can't
get a moment's rest around here.

34:46.501 --> 34:49.050
This guy,
and if you could just...

34:49.129 --> 34:50.176
Mr. Woodroof!

34:52.007 --> 34:53.600
Where are you going?

34:53.675 --> 34:54.927
I signed myself out.

34:55.092 --> 34:56.310
You're too sick to leave here.

34:57.178 --> 34:58.896
Worst case scenario being what?

35:00.056 --> 35:01.478
We can make you comfortable.

35:01.558 --> 35:05.233
What? Hook me up to the morphine
drip, let me fade on out?

35:06.062 --> 35:08.781
Nah. Sorry lady, but I prefer
to die with my boots on.

35:38.470 --> 35:41.144
I still live here, you hear me?

35:42.557 --> 35:44.901
I still fucking live here!

36:43.368 --> 36:44.961
Fuck you!

38:32.936 --> 38:34.438
<i>I'm looking for Dr. Vass.</i>

38:34.729 --> 38:35.946
Speak up.

38:36.022 --> 38:37.774
I'm looking for AZT.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.531
You won't find that shit here.

38:41.653 --> 38:42.996
Looking to poison yourself?

38:46.825 --> 38:49.374
Jesus fucking Christ.
Maria?

38:52.413 --> 38:54.040
Check him in.

39:06.261 --> 39:10.391
Cocaine, alcohol,
methamphetamine,

39:10.473 --> 39:11.816
AZT?

39:13.226 --> 39:15.820
Well, that's what I call
a recipe for disaster.

39:17.146 --> 39:19.274
This place is a shithole, Doc.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.405
Who said I was a doctor?

39:21.484 --> 39:23.657
They revoked my license to
practice three years ago.

39:23.736 --> 39:26.080
That's why I'm
down in this shithole.

39:26.155 --> 39:28.499
Why? What did you do?

39:31.244 --> 39:33.963
These drugs you're doing, they're
breaking down your immune system.

39:34.038 --> 39:36.757
Making you susceptible
to infection.

39:36.833 --> 39:39.211
You're saying cocaine's
givin' me pneumonia?

39:39.294 --> 39:41.547
No, I'm saying cocaine
made you more susceptible,

39:41.629 --> 39:43.381
as did the AZT.

39:43.464 --> 39:45.512
Nah, the AZT's
what was helping me.

39:45.925 --> 39:48.678
The only people AZT helps
are the people who sell it.

39:48.803 --> 39:51.477
It kills every cell it
comes in contact with.

39:52.682 --> 39:56.687
I'm gonna prescribe a regimen of
vitamins as well as the mineral zinc,

39:56.811 --> 39:58.484
it'll build up
your immune system.

39:58.605 --> 40:02.075
You'll also be taking aloe
and essential fatty acids.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.118
Sound fun?

40:17.415 --> 40:20.089
You missed your last
trial appointment, Ray.

40:20.168 --> 40:21.465
Where were you?

40:21.961 --> 40:25.841
Do you like this dress, 'cause I think
the neckline's a little plunging.

40:26.341 --> 40:28.435
Rayon, the whole
purpose of this study

40:28.593 --> 40:30.595
is to determine
if AZT is helping people.

40:30.678 --> 40:32.931
C'mon, Evey, you know there
ain't no helping me.

40:33.014 --> 40:34.982
That doesn't mean
I'm gonna stop trying.

40:38.519 --> 40:41.693
Why are you so good to me?

40:43.524 --> 40:45.697
Bless your little heart.
Shut up.

40:48.529 --> 40:50.873
Just promise me you'll show
up for the rest of the trial.

40:51.032 --> 40:54.536
I promise you that
I will try my very best.

40:54.661 --> 40:57.505
I want you to mean it.

40:59.540 --> 41:00.541
Okay.

41:04.712 --> 41:07.340
Is that Marcus from Home Ec?

41:08.216 --> 41:09.263
I swear to God!

41:09.342 --> 41:13.313
He has grown up, my Lord!

41:13.388 --> 41:16.312
A little too plunging
by the way, I think, yes.

41:17.809 --> 41:20.062
I appreciate your honesty.

41:23.398 --> 41:24.900
Damn it.

41:35.076 --> 41:36.123
<i>Well?</i>

41:36.953 --> 41:40.207
Better. T-cell
count's improving.

41:41.582 --> 41:42.925
I Still got HIV?

41:46.587 --> 41:48.305
You'll always test
positive for HIV.

41:48.923 --> 41:50.300
And now you've got AIDS

41:50.383 --> 41:52.932
'cause of all the toxic shit
you've been putting in your body.

41:53.052 --> 41:54.269
You shot your immune system.

41:54.345 --> 41:56.939
Now you got chronic pneumonia,
among other things.

41:57.015 --> 42:00.019
It can cause memory loss,
mood swings, aching joints.

42:00.101 --> 42:01.353
If it sucks, I got it.

42:01.519 --> 42:02.691
Yeah.

42:02.770 --> 42:06.195
I can't get my cock up,
all that shit.

42:06.274 --> 42:08.151
If it is shit,
I got it, don't I?

42:08.234 --> 42:12.705
Yeah, well, let's not start
a pity party too soon.

42:12.780 --> 42:14.874
That is DDC.

42:15.116 --> 42:19.246
It acts as an antiviral, similar
to AZT, but less toxic.

42:19.620 --> 42:22.214
And this is Peptide T.

42:22.290 --> 42:25.134
It's a protein,
totally non-toxic.

42:25.251 --> 42:28.471
Early studies have shown that
this can help with all that.

42:28.629 --> 42:31.303
It's what I've been giving
you since you got here.

42:32.300 --> 42:34.894
You can't buy this in the USA?

42:34.969 --> 42:36.266
Not approved.

42:36.387 --> 42:37.639
Shit.

42:42.226 --> 42:43.318
Look at this place.

42:44.103 --> 42:49.234
Fucking chinks, homos,
herbs, hot nurses.

42:49.942 --> 42:52.570
You got a regular New World
Order going on here, Vass.

42:52.653 --> 42:54.747
You could be making
a fortune off of this.

43:10.296 --> 43:12.845
<i>You get caught,
don't say you got AIDS.</i>

43:12.924 --> 43:13.925
<i>They'll never let you back in.</i>

43:28.606 --> 43:33.032
And a blessed day to you, sir.
Have a blessed day.

43:38.533 --> 43:39.534
Whoa.

44:04.392 --> 44:06.360
- Anything to declare?
- No, nothing.

44:06.519 --> 44:08.066
Have a good day.
Thank you.

44:12.567 --> 44:14.069
And a blessed day to you, sir.

44:14.235 --> 44:16.283
Father, passport please.

44:21.075 --> 44:22.577
Anything to declare?

44:22.743 --> 44:24.165
No, sir, <i>nada.</i>

44:43.514 --> 44:45.266
You're a priest?
Yes, I am.

44:47.518 --> 44:50.442
I'm Richard Barkley from the Food
and Drug Administration office.

44:50.521 --> 44:52.398
How can I help you,
Mr. Barkley?

44:55.026 --> 44:56.403
Well...

44:59.197 --> 45:01.791
You have over 3,000 pills here.

45:01.908 --> 45:03.956
You're only allowed to
bring in a 90-day supply.

45:04.035 --> 45:08.040
Yes, as I was telling
the gentleman earlier,

45:08.122 --> 45:09.465
I'm a sick man.

45:09.624 --> 45:11.547
I happen to have cancer.

45:12.877 --> 45:17.053
I take 33 pills a day.

45:17.632 --> 45:20.806
These are my vials of vitamins,

45:20.968 --> 45:24.142
that is a non-toxic
protein serum.

45:24.722 --> 45:27.145
This is my
90-day supply.

45:33.481 --> 45:34.482
Vitamins?

45:38.319 --> 45:41.994
You do realize that importing
illegal drugs for sale,

45:42.073 --> 45:43.666
it's a very serious offense.

45:43.783 --> 45:45.581
Well, of course it is,
and as I said,

45:45.660 --> 45:48.709
they're not for sale,
nor are they illegal.

45:49.413 --> 45:51.165
Merely unapproved.

45:55.169 --> 45:56.591
If we get the slightest
indication that

45:56.671 --> 45:58.173
you're selling
these drugs for profit,

45:59.757 --> 46:03.512
you could be thrown in jail
for a very long time, Father.

46:06.472 --> 46:10.852
Hand to God, I promise to take every
single one of these pills myself.

46:12.645 --> 46:15.489
My life depends on them, son.

47:14.540 --> 47:15.837
Cowboy, you coming in?

47:18.586 --> 47:20.213
Fuckin' kiddin' me?

47:23.007 --> 47:24.850
This man also
had a transfusion.

47:24.925 --> 47:28.270
The AZT, we can tell who's
on it by the symptoms.

47:28.429 --> 47:30.431
Most of them need new blood.

47:31.057 --> 47:32.730
He's actually getting worse.

47:32.850 --> 47:34.944
So why are they
stopping the trial?

47:35.019 --> 47:36.191
What d'you mean?

47:36.270 --> 47:38.944
Avonex Industries.
You didn't see the memo?

47:39.774 --> 47:43.574
Claim most people are feeling
better, and fewer people are dying.

47:43.694 --> 47:45.196
Transfusions always make
patients feel better.

47:45.279 --> 47:48.123
Give the placebo patients new
blood, they'll feel better, too.

47:48.282 --> 47:50.876
I have questions about
the drug's safety, David.

47:50.951 --> 47:53.374
It's dropping white blood cells
in a lot of my patients.

47:53.454 --> 47:55.172
Yeah, well,
it's their call, Eve,

47:55.247 --> 47:57.045
so we can get the drug to the
people who actually need it.

47:57.124 --> 47:58.125
But after eight months?

47:58.250 --> 48:01.880
Well, the test results were
overwhelmingly positive. AZT works.

48:02.463 --> 48:04.932
We don't know what the long-term effects are.
It's irresponsible.

48:05.424 --> 48:07.051
These people die, Eve.

48:07.802 --> 48:09.804
There are
no long-term effects.

48:09.887 --> 48:11.889
Can I read a copy of the study?

48:12.431 --> 48:13.808
Still being written.

48:20.231 --> 48:22.074
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

48:23.317 --> 48:26.070
Jesus fucking Christ,
you fucking idiot!

48:26.237 --> 48:28.080
I've been looking
for you, Lonestar.

48:28.239 --> 48:29.991
Know I coulda killed you, huh?

48:30.116 --> 48:32.244
I feel better,
I wanted to thank you.

48:32.326 --> 48:34.670
Well, good for you, now get
the fuck outta my car.

48:34.787 --> 48:37.085
I need more of that
cocktail shit you got.

48:37.164 --> 48:39.758
Listen, Tinkerbell, unless you
got more cash or new clients,

48:39.834 --> 48:41.302
I'm busy, now get
the fuck outta my car.

48:41.377 --> 48:44.927
Let's just do this quickly
so I can get the fuck out.

48:46.340 --> 48:48.183
You got enough for 20 of us?

48:51.595 --> 48:52.812
Yep!

48:53.597 --> 48:54.849
You know what?

48:55.850 --> 49:00.105
You don't deserve our money,
you homophobic asshole.

49:04.608 --> 49:05.825
Toodaloo!

49:16.162 --> 49:19.211
Am I fuckin'
dreamin' or what?

49:29.300 --> 49:30.893
I got your 20 in the trunk.

49:35.514 --> 49:38.393
Find me 20 more, cut you in.

49:38.517 --> 49:40.394
Five percent.

49:40.478 --> 49:42.401
Adios, cowboy.

49:45.483 --> 49:46.905
Fuck's your problem?

49:47.026 --> 49:50.656
I can handle your insults,
but five percent?

49:55.910 --> 49:57.753
A'ight, 10.

49:57.870 --> 50:01.249
Twenty five,
take it or leave it.

50:08.422 --> 50:09.719
I don't have all day.

50:09.882 --> 50:11.179
God damn it.

50:23.938 --> 50:25.110
Deal?

50:26.774 --> 50:27.946
Deal.

50:30.528 --> 50:31.745
We'll take care of y'all.

50:35.032 --> 50:37.080
Two T's, one Vit.

50:38.035 --> 50:40.288
How much is on each bottle.

50:40.454 --> 50:42.127
Rayon!
Where the fuck you going?

50:42.206 --> 50:44.550
C'mon in, it's a fucking
bore out here!

50:46.752 --> 50:47.799
God damn it.

51:07.648 --> 51:11.619
He with the most honey
attracts the most bees.

51:12.820 --> 51:13.821
Yep.

51:13.946 --> 51:15.823
Lots of customers
here, darling.

51:15.990 --> 51:17.913
A little smile
would go a long way.

51:33.299 --> 51:34.767
Ever hear of Peptide T?

51:40.014 --> 51:41.357
Thank you.

51:42.141 --> 51:43.358
Fuck off.

51:44.018 --> 51:45.486
Ronnie,
where you going?

52:06.874 --> 52:09.127
You've got to be kiddin' me.

52:09.209 --> 52:12.884
This place is perfect. We wanna
lay low, not get busted.

52:12.963 --> 52:15.182
Besides, I got a plan.

52:15.883 --> 52:18.727
Well, it's very in, turquoise.

52:18.844 --> 52:20.221
Right up your alley.

52:26.518 --> 52:30.819
This place is disgusting.
We have got to disinfect.

52:30.898 --> 52:32.992
Do not use
the word "we."

52:33.067 --> 52:36.162
Now, you wanna put your apron
on, start cleaning shit up.

52:36.236 --> 52:37.909
I wouldn't know where to start.

52:40.366 --> 52:42.084
Well, howdy, Counselor.

52:42.159 --> 52:44.253
Hi, I'm Rayon.

52:44.328 --> 52:45.420
That's my partner.

52:46.664 --> 52:47.836
Business partner.

52:49.041 --> 52:50.509
Your office is next door.

52:56.090 --> 52:57.512
Have fun, boys.

53:06.016 --> 53:08.519
Now, this is all
for your personal use?

53:08.602 --> 53:10.195
Oh, absolutely.

53:10.270 --> 53:12.773
I got you the paperwork
for your corporation.

53:12.898 --> 53:15.526
I do not wanna know
what that is for.

53:16.402 --> 53:19.531
Well, I ain't selling
drugs no more, Counselor.

53:19.613 --> 53:23.288
I'm givin' them away, for
free by selling memberships.

53:24.118 --> 53:25.995
Four hundred dollars
a month in dues,

53:26.078 --> 53:27.705
and you get all
the meds you want.

53:28.747 --> 53:30.215
You son of a bitch.

53:30.290 --> 53:32.384
Bitches. Plural.

53:32.459 --> 53:34.006
There's a bunch of
faggots up in New York

53:34.086 --> 53:35.679
runnin' a hell of
a racket just like this.

53:35.963 --> 53:37.385
It's where I got the idea.

53:37.464 --> 53:39.967
Welcome to the
Dallas Buyers Club.

53:40.634 --> 53:42.386
<i>Avonex
Industries announced today</i>

53:42.469 --> 53:45.348
<i>that AZT has been approved as
the first drug to treat AIDS.</i>

53:45.431 --> 53:48.401
<i>At the cost of $10,000
per year, per patient,</i>

53:48.475 --> 53:51.399
<i>AZ T is the most expensive
drug ever marketed.</i>

53:51.645 --> 53:54.945
<i>Avonex stock jumped a whopping
12 percent today on the news.</i>

53:57.109 --> 54:00.238
I know. I hope he's okay, too. It's been too long.

54:01.905 --> 54:03.248
Oh, my Lord,
I'll call you back.

54:03.323 --> 54:08.079
Michael and Ian, the happiest
couple in the entire universe.

54:08.162 --> 54:11.416
Oh, my God.
Gimme some sugar.

54:12.833 --> 54:15.928
Ian, you look like
a two dollar bill.

54:16.920 --> 54:18.672
Hold on, you just
stay right here, okay?

54:18.797 --> 54:21.346
I'm so glad that you came.
We're gonna fix you up.

54:21.467 --> 54:24.346
Ronnie, we got
two new customers.

54:25.095 --> 54:27.143
You call me Ronnie again,

54:28.849 --> 54:32.774
I'm gonna use this to give you that
sex change you've been hopin' for.

54:32.853 --> 54:34.321
Send them in.

54:35.481 --> 54:36.858
Meet the big boss.

54:37.691 --> 54:39.113
C'mon in.

54:41.028 --> 54:43.030
Oh, shit, sorry.
C'mon, sit down.

54:47.034 --> 54:49.036
Rayon, turn that shit down!

54:49.119 --> 54:50.541
Meds and the
treatments are free,

54:50.704 --> 54:52.502
but membership is $400 a month.

54:52.790 --> 54:55.213
All right? You're gonna
hafta sign a waiver.

54:55.375 --> 54:58.049
We are not responsible for
the drugs that we give you.

54:58.212 --> 55:01.386
You croak, you croak. It's
not our problem. It's yours.

55:01.548 --> 55:03.300
We have some AZT,

55:03.383 --> 55:05.636
and it helped Ian a
little in the beginning.

55:05.719 --> 55:08.222
All right, first off, flush
that shit down the toilet.

55:08.305 --> 55:09.648
It's bad news.

55:09.723 --> 55:12.977
Secondly, stay away from anything
that's gonna cook your insides.

55:13.227 --> 55:14.479
You gotta stay clean.

55:14.561 --> 55:17.735
Third, if your brain's broke,
your wires are crossed,

55:17.856 --> 55:20.450
I got a little something called Peptide
T, it's gonna fix you right up.

55:20.567 --> 55:23.491
Clear? I got a starter pack.

55:24.029 --> 55:28.250
I'll have more in a week.
Until then, watch what you eat

55:28.367 --> 55:29.584
and who you eat.

55:30.994 --> 55:32.211
$400.

55:32.412 --> 55:34.335
Rayon, give me some coffee.

55:34.414 --> 55:37.213
Coming up, Ronnie.

55:38.752 --> 55:40.846
He didn't call,
leave a message?

55:40.921 --> 55:42.093
No, nothing.

55:43.173 --> 55:45.016
He did change his
address recently.

55:51.431 --> 55:52.728
Thanks.

55:54.101 --> 55:57.605
Shohu Okaiku?
Uh-huh.

55:57.771 --> 55:59.193
Interferon.

56:00.357 --> 56:02.200
How much can I buy from you?

56:03.068 --> 56:05.537
Yes, Mr. Yamata.
Let me figure out

56:05.612 --> 56:07.865
how much I can
take off your hands.

56:08.240 --> 56:10.368
Listen, I'm gonna
hafta call you back.

56:10.450 --> 56:15.581
Mr. Yamata, I have to go, I'm gonna
call you back, okay? Yes. Arigato.

56:15.664 --> 56:17.666
What are you doing here?

56:17.749 --> 56:19.877
Well, I live here.
Where's Rayon?

56:19.960 --> 56:21.132
You roommates?

56:21.253 --> 56:24.427
Not exactly.
What are you doing here?

56:26.884 --> 56:28.227
Roger Thompson?

56:32.264 --> 56:35.143
This is my patient.
You treating these people?

56:35.225 --> 56:36.351
They're treatin' themselves.

56:36.435 --> 56:37.482
With what?

56:37.561 --> 56:42.442
Vitamins, Peptide T, DDC, anything
but that poison you're hawkin'.

56:48.822 --> 56:50.745
Say, you ever wear any color?

56:50.824 --> 56:53.247
Seems like every time I see
you, all I see is white.

56:53.327 --> 56:55.580
You have a white coat,
white shoes, white...

56:55.662 --> 56:57.505
Tell Rayon I was
looking for him,

56:57.581 --> 57:00.050
and I'm telling my patients
to stay away from here.

57:01.919 --> 57:03.011
Excuse me.

57:03.420 --> 57:06.014
Say you wanna go grab a steak
sometime, I know it's red, but...

57:11.762 --> 57:15.266
That's the shit
that'll rot your insides.

57:15.349 --> 57:18.444
What a surprise.
FDA approved.

57:18.518 --> 57:20.941
The fuck is potassium benzoate?

57:21.021 --> 57:22.614
Preservative.

57:22.689 --> 57:26.910
You kiddin' me? Hey, don't pollute
me with this processed crap.

57:26.985 --> 57:28.453
I'm eatin' healthy,
and you should too.

57:28.528 --> 57:30.781
It's protein,
it's good for you.

57:30.864 --> 57:33.333
It's processed, put it back.

57:34.451 --> 57:37.546
You can't tell me what to do.
Such a bully!

57:48.757 --> 57:50.179
Hey, Ron.

57:50.258 --> 57:52.226
Hey, what say, T.J.?

57:54.388 --> 57:55.856
How you doin', man?

57:55.931 --> 57:58.559
Oh, just trying to make a
livin', you know how it is.

57:58.684 --> 58:00.436
Yeah, I do.

58:03.897 --> 58:07.492
Jesus, fucking
faggots everywhere.

58:08.777 --> 58:11.451
Hey, T.J., this is Rayon.
Rayon, T.J.

58:11.571 --> 58:12.743
Hey.

58:15.742 --> 58:17.995
He said hi to you,
shake his hand.

58:21.081 --> 58:22.924
C'mon, buddy,
what's your problem?

58:28.046 --> 58:29.093
Fuck you.

58:36.263 --> 58:38.436
Shake his hand,
T.J. C'mon.

58:40.100 --> 58:43.775
Shake his hand, T.J.
Give him a good one.

58:45.689 --> 58:46.781
All right?
All right.

58:46.898 --> 58:50.198
Now, will you fuck off?

58:50.694 --> 58:52.947
Go on back to
your miserable life.

58:55.282 --> 58:56.283
Hmm?

59:16.720 --> 59:17.937
What?

59:24.978 --> 59:26.480
Put 'em back.

59:32.069 --> 59:34.117
All right, guys, hang in there,

59:34.196 --> 59:35.994
we'll get you
hooked up shortly.

59:44.164 --> 59:45.416
Fifty bucks?

59:48.126 --> 59:52.256
No. A'ight? You ain't got the
money, you don't join the club.

59:53.006 --> 59:54.349
Hey, everybody!

59:55.092 --> 59:58.016
Let's get this straight.
Membership, 400 bucks.

59:58.178 --> 59:59.771
If you're a member,
you get the meds.

59:59.888 --> 01:00:02.732
If you're not a member,
you don't. Got it?

01:00:02.808 --> 01:00:04.606
I'm not running
a goddamn charity.

01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:07.479
You need $350 more.

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:32.212
Your bags are all packed

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:34.673
and here's your ticket.

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:39.853
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Ray!

01:00:42.931 --> 01:00:43.932
Fuckin' high?

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.317
None of your business.

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:48.395
Well, when it concerns
my business,

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.355
it sure the fuck
is my business.

01:00:51.273 --> 01:00:53.321
If I can't trust you,
it is my business.

01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:56.904
You motherfucker.

01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:58.492
Denise, get in here!

01:00:59.865 --> 01:01:00.866
You're in charge.

01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:03.828
No! You can trust me. Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Fucking junkie,

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:05.036
look at you,
you're a fucking mess!

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.918
Oh, God.
Get your shit straight.

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:10.171
Or I'll chunk you to the curb along
with your 25 fuckin' percent.

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:13.337
Quit acting like
a little bitch!

01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:17.307
Have my new Caddy at the
airport for when I get back,

01:01:18.216 --> 01:01:20.014
and watch over
that fucking monkey.

01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:40.868
Mr. Woodroof.

01:01:46.244 --> 01:01:47.245
Mmm.

01:01:53.752 --> 01:01:56.050
Regarding your order.
Mmm-hmm.

01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:59.099
I am so sorry but we
are no longer allowed

01:01:59.174 --> 01:02:02.144
to export interferon
to United States.

01:02:03.094 --> 01:02:05.347
Well, what d'you mean, Doc?

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:08.855
We discussed this two weeks
ago on the telephone.

01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:13.360
I was not aware of the
regulation two weeks ago.

01:02:13.438 --> 01:02:16.692
I am sorry. I know
you've come a long way.

01:02:17.776 --> 01:02:20.620
Fourteen hours on a plane

01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:24.662
but, hey, who gives
a shit though, right?

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:28.416
Look, if it's about money. I could
make it worth your while, all right?

01:02:28.495 --> 01:02:30.793
I've got a briefcase
full of cash right here.

01:02:30.872 --> 01:02:32.624
Please, understand.

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:39.674
Japanese doctors would be the only
ones who can make the purchase.

01:03:08.368 --> 01:03:09.836
Slow drip.

01:03:09.911 --> 01:03:11.288
Interferon?

01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:12.873
Very strong.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.549
God damn, I like
your style, Hiroshi.

01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:41.827
Okay, prepare the sedation.
Ten milligrams of Propofol.

01:03:42.527 --> 01:03:43.949
Can I have your
passport please?

01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:47.784
Yes, have Dr. Sevard
proceed until I get there.

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:50.793
I've gotta go.
Where you coming from?

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:53.163
Oh, excuse me, um, Japan.

01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:55.794
Medical research.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:04:00.133
Good to be back in the USA.

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:02.968
Thank you, sir.

01:04:58.144 --> 01:05:00.988
<i>We don't know what
the drugs are. He's got HIV.</i>

01:05:01.356 --> 01:05:02.528
Woodroof?

01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:06.032
AIDS.
I got AIDS.

01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:09.281
Won't you come on in,
join the party.

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:13.247
Ah, Mr. Woodroof.

01:05:13.493 --> 01:05:14.710
Dr. See-vard.

01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:19.670
I'll bet you're
surprised to see me.

01:05:19.791 --> 01:05:21.964
Well, you nearly
killed yourself,

01:05:22.043 --> 01:05:25.593
so we need to know where
you acquired the drugs.

01:05:27.132 --> 01:05:28.759
Well, I need to know
just exactly

01:05:28.842 --> 01:05:31.220
what you're pumping into
my bloodstream here, Doc.

01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:34.606
All right, this is
a combination of AZT,

01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:37.685
and you've also got
a full spectrum of...

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.394
Don't! Don't!

01:05:40.478 --> 01:05:42.822
I'm suing you for
attempted murder.

01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:45.946
Where's my stuff, Barkley?

01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:47.277
Your stuff gave you
a heart attack.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.532
Go to hell.

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:51.619
I'll say what goes
in my body, not you.

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:55.285
That decision, like it or not, is left
up to the people in this hospital.

01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:58.417
What d'you think, I'm one of your
goddamn guinea pigs, Sevard, huh?

01:05:58.496 --> 01:05:59.748
I look like a rodent to you?

01:05:59.831 --> 01:06:03.210
Mr. Woodroof,
you think you're clever?

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:05.295
You shoot your body
full of an unknown drug

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:07.631
and you smuggle
in a two year supply.

01:06:08.006 --> 01:06:11.385
Well, hear this.
I will bust you.

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:14.597
I will take your drugs and I
will burn them. You're done.

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:16.431
You're a fool if you
think you're helping yourself.

01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:19.267
That's right, fucking
fooled you, didn't I?

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:22.354
You said I'd be dead in 30 days,
well, howdy fuckin' doody,

01:06:22.437 --> 01:06:25.441
because it's a year later,
and look who's still here.

01:06:25.523 --> 01:06:27.070
I'm done with you.

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:28.197
Ronnie!

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:30.362
You have anything
left to say to me,

01:06:30.445 --> 01:06:32.493
you say it to my real doctor,
Dr. Eve Saks,

01:06:32.572 --> 01:06:35.246
and you, you bring a fucking army.

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:36.668
Mr. Woodroof,
please get back in the bed.

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:38.203
Enjoy the view!

01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:40.626
The hell is goin' on in here?

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:42.670
Dr. Eve's good
though, right?

01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:44.717
Talk straight to
my fucking face.

01:06:45.919 --> 01:06:49.389
You're his physician, and you can't
tell me what medications he's on?

01:06:49.464 --> 01:06:51.262
He came in here once for advice

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:53.343
and I have no idea what he
does outside this hospital.

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:56.930
Well, the FDA just confiscated
2,000 vials of alpha interferon,

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:59.266
which he was about to sell to
AIDS patients, to our patients.

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:01.568
Actually, I've been reading
a lot about Buyers Clubs.

01:07:01.643 --> 01:07:02.690
They've been
having some success

01:07:02.769 --> 01:07:04.521
eliminating symptoms with
some of these new drugs.

01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:07.778
Yeah, and without controlled trials,
we're not gonna find a cure

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:10.076
because we're not gonna
have any legitimate data.

01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:12.279
So tell your patients
to stay away from him.

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:13.872
Yes, sir.

01:07:17.075 --> 01:07:18.167
No.

01:07:18.826 --> 01:07:19.998
Yeah. Uh-huh.

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:23.123
Hold on, I said hold on!

01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:27.294
This guy says that the Florida
Buyers Club is cheaper.

01:07:27.377 --> 01:07:30.130
Well, tell him to go back to
the fucking Sunshine State!

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:31.715
<i>That's what I'm telling
you, I can't get it back.</i>

01:07:31.798 --> 01:07:35.018
What d'you mean you can't get it back?
It was authorized by a doctor!

01:07:35.093 --> 01:07:38.518
<i>The FDA said it was a Japanese
doctor with no legal standing.</i>

01:07:38.596 --> 01:07:40.519
<i>What can I say?
They make it up as they go.</i>

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:41.732
God damn it!

01:07:42.433 --> 01:07:44.982
All right, check Amsterdam,
China and Israel,

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:46.813
'cause that's
where the fuck I'm going!

01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:55.993
I like your style, Doc!

01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:05.836
Good doing business with you.

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:16.638
<i>If I don't trust the white coat</i>

01:08:16.801 --> 01:08:18.223
<i>who's trying to
sell me the drugs,</i>

01:08:18.303 --> 01:08:21.432
<i>I FedEx it to Seattle to my lab
there, and they test it for me.</i>

01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:23.892
Then I test it all on myself
before I give it to anyone.

01:08:23.975 --> 01:08:27.104
I respect that you're
learning about your illness,

01:08:27.185 --> 01:08:29.154
but some of these people
need to be in the hospital.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:32.113
Why? All they want
to serve up is AZT.

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:33.988
AZT helps eradicate the virus.

01:08:34.068 --> 01:08:37.037
Fuck the virus! Dr. Saks,
you know this.

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:40.787
Once you got the virus, you're
married to it. AZT or not.

01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:42.915
I'm talking about
symptoms and survival.

01:08:42.993 --> 01:08:44.496
Look, I'm no scientist,
but shit...

01:08:44.578 --> 01:08:48.334
You're not 'cause
you sound so scientific.

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:51.301
Are you fuckin' high again?

01:08:51.544 --> 01:08:53.011
Uh...

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:54.220
Nope.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.889
Why are my fucking
walls painted red?

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:02.063
It's cranberry mocha,
it's for the holidays.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.560
All right, look, people can
live with this disease

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:08.361
longer than they're
saying, right?

01:09:08.435 --> 01:09:11.439
Ninety six percent of the people
in the USA who have AIDS today

01:09:11.522 --> 01:09:12.738
are gonna die
within six months.

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:13.941
I know the statistics.

01:09:14.024 --> 01:09:15.072
Then use them.

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:18.529
You don't give AZT to somebody with
a broken immune system, it's toxic.

01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:19.830
If you're abusing it
like you did,

01:09:19.906 --> 01:09:21.828
and you're just taking it without
any medical surveillance,

01:09:21.908 --> 01:09:23.000
of course it is.

01:09:23.076 --> 01:09:24.578
Yeah, I did abuse it.

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:28.541
But I'm off it now, look at me.
I'm here. Feeling great.

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:30.000
And I'm not the only one.

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:34.837
Why is Boy George's mug
all over my fucking room?

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:38.429
It's Marc Bolan, silly.

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:41.010
It's another babe
for your wall of shame.

01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:42.265
Get out, both of you.

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:44.268
Take your sunflower
and get the fuck out.

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:46.520
Oh, c'mon, I'm not finished yet.
Now. Get out.

01:09:49.519 --> 01:09:50.691
Isn't he cute?

01:10:06.327 --> 01:10:08.421
Where the hell are
my trial patients?

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:15.170
We need you to
fill out this form.

01:10:15.253 --> 01:10:18.006
We need your name, your
address, phone number,

01:10:18.089 --> 01:10:20.717
your complete medical history
and bring it back to me.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:21.892
Denise!

01:10:21.968 --> 01:10:23.220
Excuse me.

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:28.145
Who's the girl?

01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:29.396
She's a customer.

01:10:29.475 --> 01:10:31.022
She's HIV positive?

01:10:31.102 --> 01:10:33.070
She's got full blown AIDS.

01:10:40.653 --> 01:10:42.075
Need your phone numbers,

01:10:42.155 --> 01:10:44.658
and here I'm gonna need your
complete medical history,

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:46.994
because we need to know
what's going on before you...

01:11:14.729 --> 01:11:16.106
No, no, off the Caddy.

01:11:24.155 --> 01:11:25.577
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:11:30.745 --> 01:11:32.588
No, you stick it in, pussy.

01:11:32.663 --> 01:11:34.290
Who d'you think's gonna do
that when I'm not here?

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:36.091
Don't.

01:11:36.876 --> 01:11:38.219
Stick it in!

01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:43.636
I swear, Ray,

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:47.224
God sure was
dressing the wrong doll

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:49.180
when he blessed you
with a set of balls.

01:11:49.388 --> 01:11:50.731
Gimme that.

01:11:51.808 --> 01:11:54.652
Now, look, it's one thing
for me not to like ya,

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:56.980
but why can't you be
a better friend to yourself?

01:11:57.063 --> 01:12:00.658
If I really thought you were
interested, I'd tell you.

01:12:03.194 --> 01:12:04.696
What you doin' here?

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:08.454
The IRS.
You're being audited.

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:11.036
Oh, fuck.

01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:15.040
Now here's a couple of the
government's finest right there, huh?

01:12:15.122 --> 01:12:19.252
Good job, boys, great stuff. It's
how they got Al Capone isn't it?

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:22.009
Don't piss 'em off. If there's
a fine, we'll pay it.

01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:25.058
Well, if there's a fine,
no, you wanna fine me, huh?

01:12:25.132 --> 01:12:27.476
How much you want?

01:12:27.552 --> 01:12:29.304
Ten grand? Twenty grand?

01:12:29.387 --> 01:12:30.684
You think that's gonna stop me?

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:32.099
What's your
fucking number, huh?

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:34.775
What is it? Huh?

01:12:35.309 --> 01:12:37.107
Take this, motherfucker!

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.818
<i>Operations are expected to
return to normal today</i>

01:12:39.897 --> 01:12:42.070
<i>at FDA headquarters
outside Washington,</i>

01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:45.904
<i>a day after the arrest
of 175 demonstrators.</i>

01:12:46.112 --> 01:12:48.535
<i>The protestors, some of
whom are dying from AIDS,</i>

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:50.992
<i>blocked the entrances
to the FDA complex.</i>

01:12:51.075 --> 01:12:52.702
<i>They were demanding
faster action</i>

01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:54.287
<i>on new drugs to
treat the deadly virus.</i>

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:36.454
You don't have a snowball's chance
in hell wearing that thing.

01:13:36.537 --> 01:13:38.084
Rayon, I can assure you

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:41.839
that I do not need help picking
up ladies from your sorry ass.

01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:46.515
Trailer trash and rodeo groupies
do not count as ladies.

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:49.175
You get her flowers?

01:13:56.933 --> 01:13:58.105
Oh, hell!
Mmm-hmm.

01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:01.525
Have a good time, girls.

01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:02.859
Oh, Ron.

01:14:15.242 --> 01:14:17.415
Wildflowers, Texas style.

01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:19.630
That's for you.
Really?

01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:20.706
Mmm-hmm.

01:14:21.165 --> 01:14:22.337
Well, that's beautiful.

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:23.950
I don't even hafta water them.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.008
Nope.
Thank you.

01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:27.137
Thanks for coming.

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:28.339
Sure.

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:33.099
Guess who paid me a
little visit today. Who?

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:36.806
IRS. They're trying
to run me out of town.

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:39.476
Got any idea who might
have tipped them off?

01:14:41.227 --> 01:14:42.570
You don't believe
that I would actually...

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:48.402
No, no, not you. That snake you work
for, that's my prime candidate.

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:51.078
I gotta ask you if you can
watch what you say around him,

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:53.406
I mean, 'cause he's
got a hard-on for me.

01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:56.910
As a matter of fact, if you heard
anything, hear anything in his office

01:14:56.993 --> 01:15:00.088
that might concern me or the
business, I'd sure appreciate

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:03.166
you share with me.
Appreciate it.

01:15:03.249 --> 01:15:05.672
Hello sir, bring us your
best bottle of Cabernet.

01:15:10.798 --> 01:15:13.927
Nice restaurant,
beautiful woman,

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:16.513
swear I feel
like a human again.

01:15:18.723 --> 01:15:19.975
Why are we here?

01:15:20.057 --> 01:15:22.059
Well just for this, wine, dine,

01:15:22.226 --> 01:15:24.228
have a good time,
enjoy ourselves.

01:15:24.311 --> 01:15:25.358
Right.

01:15:25.563 --> 01:15:29.033
It's as simple as that, I promise you, doll.
C'mon, try it with me.

01:15:29.984 --> 01:15:31.031
Breathe.

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:32.862
Relax, smell the steak.

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:34.947
If you need more inspiration,

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:39.127
just look at the handsome man
sitting across the table from you,

01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:41.124
paying for your dinner tonight.

01:15:42.288 --> 01:15:43.460
Huh?
All right.

01:15:44.248 --> 01:15:45.545
Why d'you become a doctor?

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:47.589
Really?

01:15:48.085 --> 01:15:49.883
Why'd I become a doctor?
Um...

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:51.680
I was good at science

01:15:53.632 --> 01:15:56.852
and my dad said that studying
history was a waste of time,

01:15:56.927 --> 01:15:58.349
so I went to med school.

01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:01.979
Your dad sounds like a practical man.
He was.

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:04.481
He was.

01:16:05.311 --> 01:16:08.440
Your turn, what about you?
Why did you become...

01:16:08.522 --> 01:16:09.944
Electrician.
An electrician?

01:16:10.024 --> 01:16:11.025
Right.

01:16:11.108 --> 01:16:15.488
My dad was an electrician,
pretty darn good one, too.

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:18.245
He was a hell of
a lot better drinker.

01:16:18.324 --> 01:16:19.371
I can imagine.

01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:22.454
Anyway, I was around it a
lot, the electrician part.

01:16:22.536 --> 01:16:23.662
Got kinda good at it.

01:16:23.746 --> 01:16:26.590
Liked to open shit up,
check out the insides,

01:16:26.665 --> 01:16:28.713
put it back together,

01:16:28.793 --> 01:16:30.761
hell, somebody thought
I was good enough at it

01:16:30.836 --> 01:16:32.679
to pay me
a little money for it,

01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:35.383
so I kept some change in my
pocket and I ended up being

01:16:35.466 --> 01:16:37.343
the proud owner
of a Texaco card.

01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:40.934
What about your mom?

01:16:42.306 --> 01:16:43.728
Mom was a painter.

01:16:44.683 --> 01:16:45.684
Um...

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:48.653
Kind of a gypsy woman.

01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:55.320
She got tired of the bullshit and
all that, you know how it is?

01:16:55.402 --> 01:16:56.745
She paint this?
Yep.

01:16:56.821 --> 01:16:58.744
Your mom?

01:16:58.823 --> 01:16:59.949
Yep.

01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:03.376
You ain't gotta
hang it or nothin',

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:05.204
I mean, I know, like,
you like everything perfect.

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:06.834
I do not.

01:17:06.914 --> 01:17:09.793
I will hang this.
I'm gonna hang this.

01:17:10.668 --> 01:17:11.760
Good.

01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:15.347
Don't you wanna keep it?

01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:18.684
You enjoy your life,
little lady.

01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:21.019
You only got one.

01:17:22.513 --> 01:17:25.858
Yes, sir, that's
my favorite grape juice.

01:17:28.936 --> 01:17:31.985
Hey, thanks for coming.

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:34.571
To wild flowers!

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:36.277
And bottle and rib eyes.

01:17:56.797 --> 01:17:58.094
I'm gonna kill him.

01:18:10.895 --> 01:18:12.021
See you next week.

01:18:12.646 --> 01:18:14.523
I have a court order
permitting me to confiscate...

01:18:14.607 --> 01:18:15.733
You all are handsome,

01:18:15.816 --> 01:18:18.069
but if you don't have a search
warrant, you ain't coming in.

01:18:18.152 --> 01:18:19.199
Ron!

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:20.992
The hell is this?

01:18:21.071 --> 01:18:22.368
Sorry, Ron.

01:18:22.448 --> 01:18:23.870
Gentlemen, I'm gonna need y'all

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:26.748
to leave the premises in
an orderly fashion, please.

01:18:27.161 --> 01:18:29.414
Mr. Woodroof, I have a court order
permitting us to confiscate

01:18:29.496 --> 01:18:32.249
any and all non FDA-approved
drugs or supplements.

01:18:32.333 --> 01:18:34.301
My entire inventory.

01:18:35.252 --> 01:18:38.096
That's aloe vera, sir.
It's a plant.

01:18:38.172 --> 01:18:40.266
How the shit d'you
care if people eat plants?

01:18:40.341 --> 01:18:41.763
It's improperly labeled.

01:18:41.842 --> 01:18:43.936
That's a violation
of FDA regulations.

01:18:44.011 --> 01:18:46.059
That's a bullshit technicality,
and you know it.

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:48.061
Rayon, get my lawyer on the phone.
Yeah!

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:51.360
We're concerned with preventing
a market for illegal drugs.

01:18:51.435 --> 01:18:53.779
What's illegal about a bunch
of vitamins and minerals, huh?

01:18:53.854 --> 01:18:56.198
Vitamins and minerals that gave
you a heart attack, remember?

01:18:56.273 --> 01:18:57.741
No, I ain't selling
them no more,

01:18:57.816 --> 01:18:59.318
you confiscated them, remember?

01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:02.454
What, you got
Alzheimer's, Richard?

01:19:03.322 --> 01:19:04.744
Take some of that Peptide T.

01:19:04.823 --> 01:19:06.996
Fixes that, too.
No, I remember these.

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:08.669
Yeah, it's a fuckin' protein.

01:19:08.786 --> 01:19:11.414
For dementia, which I have.

01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:15.252
And for the hundredth time, just
take a fucking look at my research.

01:19:15.334 --> 01:19:16.551
Mr. Woodroof,
I wouldn't want you

01:19:16.627 --> 01:19:17.753
to spend your
last days in jail.

01:19:17.836 --> 01:19:19.679
If you have a product
that you want tested,

01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:21.849
fill out an application
and go through the process.

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:23.676
Don't threaten me,
motherfucker.

01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:28.185
The process. An FDA bullshit to pay up.
I know what the fuck that is.

01:19:28.305 --> 01:19:30.399
You'll be getting your
fine for non-compliance

01:19:30.474 --> 01:19:31.771
and improper labeling.

01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:33.318
- Yeah, shove it up your ass!
- Ron.

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:36.192
Your lawyer.

01:19:37.356 --> 01:19:38.448
David!

01:19:39.525 --> 01:19:41.448
David, listen.

01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:44.030
These fuckers are coming
at me, man, from all angles.

01:19:44.154 --> 01:19:45.531
I wanna file
a restraining order.

01:19:45.698 --> 01:19:47.120
<i>Against who?</i>

01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:50.043
Against the government and
the fucking FDA, that's who.

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:52.167
DO it!

01:19:55.916 --> 01:20:00.797
<i>Now the FDA is proposing a
permanent change in its regulations.</i>

01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:03.640
<i>These new
regulations specifically</i>

01:20:03.882 --> 01:20:06.635
<i>will have special criteria
that would apply to</i>

01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:09.518
<i>immediately
life-threatening conditions,</i>

01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:12.191
<i>recognizing that such patients</i>

01:20:12.266 --> 01:20:15.190
<i>are willing to accept
the greater risk</i>

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:17.655
<i>than that which
normally would be the case.</i>

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:20.574
<i>The drugs may only be
purchased by individuals</i>

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:23.744
<i>who have been prescribed
the medication by a physician.</i>

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:25.913
Now, what the hell
does that mean?

01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:29.034
Means we were unapproved,
now we're illegal.

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:31.536
You put the seat down?

01:20:33.704 --> 01:20:34.921
Right!

01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:41.045
Mmm-hmm.

01:20:42.421 --> 01:20:43.547
Yep!

01:20:43.756 --> 01:20:46.100
Now, I gotta get these MDs
to write some goddamn scripts

01:20:46.216 --> 01:20:47.763
so we can keep dealing.

01:20:48.969 --> 01:20:49.970
Mmm-hmm.

01:20:53.932 --> 01:20:55.855
Look, I'm gonna stay on the
domestic side, all right,

01:20:55.934 --> 01:20:57.686
I need you to check out
the internationals.

01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:59.864
All right,
start with Amsterdam.

01:20:59.938 --> 01:21:01.940
Right. There's a Dr. Bradley
out in Alberta.

01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:03.367
He'll play ball with us.

01:21:03.442 --> 01:21:04.443
All right, call me back.

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:06.741
Hey, Chelsea!

01:21:07.946 --> 01:21:09.573
Get them smokies a round
of beers, will you?

01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:15.876
The credit cards are maxed,
pharmacy bills are due.

01:21:15.954 --> 01:21:18.457
You better hang on to your
money, honey. Mmm-hmm.

01:21:22.252 --> 01:21:23.970
How 'bout that size, huh?

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.974
I think they'd look nice on me.

01:21:27.091 --> 01:21:28.638
You ain't getting tits, Rayon.

01:21:29.385 --> 01:21:32.639
Now look here, memberships
are high, so is demand,

01:21:32.763 --> 01:21:35.607
so all we need is more members,
and where do we get those?

01:21:36.058 --> 01:21:37.059
Uh...

01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:39.816
Support groups.
Exactly.

01:21:40.646 --> 01:21:43.320
In the meantime,
we could try the bank.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:46.614
Yeah! Bonnie and Clyde
coming in for a loan.

01:21:52.074 --> 01:21:53.917
Would ya stop
staring at her tits, Rayon?

01:21:53.992 --> 01:21:55.539
You're starting to look normal.

01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:03.924
Oh, you keep the change,
honey, you deserve it.

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:11.684
What you got?

01:22:12.177 --> 01:22:14.475
<i>Sorry to hear about
your dad's Alzheimer's, Tuck.</i>

01:22:15.639 --> 01:22:17.812
<i>This stuff will help.
Woodroof.</i>

01:22:18.809 --> 01:22:20.026
There we go.

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:46.716
This place is a shithole.

01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:49.973
I'll give you $150 a month,

01:22:50.048 --> 01:22:53.222
plus 20% off your memberships
for four months.

01:22:53.385 --> 01:22:55.479
Mr. Woodroof. Now
don't try and con me.

01:22:55.554 --> 01:22:56.646
We don't want money.

01:22:56.805 --> 01:22:57.897
What the fuck you want?

01:22:57.973 --> 01:23:00.067
The house is free.
We wanna help.

01:23:07.399 --> 01:23:08.742
Well, that's good news.

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:11.407
Deal.

01:23:15.407 --> 01:23:16.579
You fucking with me?

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.094
<i>We got a club,
just down the street,</i>

01:23:27.169 --> 01:23:30.264
<i>where you can get the meds
that I'm talking about.</i>

01:23:32.257 --> 01:23:36.103
<i>We treat more than five times
the amount of patients</i>

01:23:36.345 --> 01:23:39.349
as large AIDS clinics,
and get this.

01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:42.105
We got only
one-tenth the death ratio.

01:23:42.226 --> 01:23:44.604
So, you wanna
be here some more?

01:23:44.728 --> 01:23:46.947
Check us out,
here's my information.

01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:52.194
<i>Step on up,
let's do some business.</i>

01:23:52.277 --> 01:23:54.279
<i>We're open 24/7.</i>

01:24:13.924 --> 01:24:15.471
She looks great.

01:24:17.803 --> 01:24:20.101
I guess I didn't make the cut.

01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:24.484
You made that choice yourself.

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.813
It wasn't a choice, Dad.

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:30.490
What do you want, Raymond?

01:24:31.108 --> 01:24:33.327
Oh, I'm fine, thanks, and you?

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:37.164
Long time, no see.

01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:43.079
I suppose I should thank you
for wearing men's clothes?

01:24:43.161 --> 01:24:44.413
Not embarrassing me?

01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:47.500
Are you ashamed of me, 'cause
I hadn't realized that.

01:24:47.624 --> 01:24:49.171
God help me.

01:24:49.376 --> 01:24:51.629
He is helping you, I have AIDS.

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.362
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:25:27.039 --> 01:25:29.963
I met somebody who's
been very kind to me

01:25:32.502 --> 01:25:34.504
and I'd like to
repay that debt,

01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:38.050
but I need help.

01:25:48.393 --> 01:25:49.736
Please.

01:25:53.190 --> 01:25:54.407
How's Mom?

01:25:55.067 --> 01:25:56.193
Raymond.

01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:58.203
Look, we're gonna
have to recoup it

01:25:58.278 --> 01:25:59.825
under a different
name or something.

01:25:59.905 --> 01:26:01.407
<i>I understand
what you're saying,</i>

01:26:01.573 --> 01:26:02.995
<i>even with this new
rule from the FDA.</i>

01:26:03.075 --> 01:26:05.999
<i>I'm sorry. Mr. Woodroof,
I'm not changing my mind.</i>

01:26:06.078 --> 01:26:07.170
God damn it.

01:26:20.926 --> 01:26:23.725
<i>God, when I meet you,</i>

01:26:25.597 --> 01:26:29.443
I'm gonna be pretty,
if it's the last thing I do.

01:26:33.063 --> 01:26:35.111
<i>I'll be a beautiful angel.</i>

01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:44.203
Dr. Browning,
I understand, all right,

01:26:44.282 --> 01:26:48.537
but do you understand
where I'm coming from? You...

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:49.621
Doc?

01:26:59.256 --> 01:27:02.635
Not one fucking MD
will write me a script.

01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:05.604
Not one. Motherfuckers.

01:27:09.641 --> 01:27:13.316
Well, maybe this will help.

01:27:23.321 --> 01:27:24.948
Where d'you get this?

01:27:28.994 --> 01:27:30.587
D'you sell your ass?

01:27:36.668 --> 01:27:37.920
Really,

01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:40.347
where d'you get it?

01:27:44.009 --> 01:27:46.683
I sold my life
insurance policy.

01:27:49.014 --> 01:27:51.312
Not like I'm
gonna need it anyway.

01:28:22.881 --> 01:28:24.053
Thank you.

01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:40.904
Guess who's going to Mexico
looking for a hot date, huh?

01:28:41.233 --> 01:28:42.576
What d'you say?

01:28:42.692 --> 01:28:45.320
Do I look like someone
who takes vacations?

01:28:45.403 --> 01:28:49.078
Well, a little tequila, sunshine
and tacos never hurt anybody.

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:50.409
Sounds nice.

01:28:50.492 --> 01:28:51.994
Is that a no?
Mmm.

01:28:52.077 --> 01:28:54.250
I kinda figured you
might rain on my party,

01:28:54.412 --> 01:28:56.585
but I had to take a shot,
didn't I?

01:28:57.666 --> 01:28:59.088
Listen, I'm onto something new.

01:28:59.417 --> 01:29:03.263
Looks real promising, and I
need to ask you a favor.

01:29:03.338 --> 01:29:05.090
I need you to write
me some 'scriptions

01:29:05.257 --> 01:29:07.009
for when I come
back across the border.

01:29:07.092 --> 01:29:10.767
Now I may not need 'em, but
if I do, then I'll have 'em.

01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:16.526
You know this law the FDA just
passed is total bullshit.

01:29:16.601 --> 01:29:17.693
It's all lip-service.

01:29:17.769 --> 01:29:20.022
I know. You're right.

01:29:20.105 --> 01:29:23.200
And I can't either, I'm sorry.

01:29:23.275 --> 01:29:26.279
We can't write scripts for
random people, random drugs.

01:29:26.403 --> 01:29:27.871
Plus, what if something goes
wrong with these drugs?

01:29:27.946 --> 01:29:29.368
We could be sued,
lose our license.

01:29:29.447 --> 01:29:30.790
I know, I know.

01:29:31.449 --> 01:29:34.578
I hear you.
Well, had to give it a shot.

01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:39.963
Speaking of, I'll be taking one
this afternoon thinking about you.

01:29:40.625 --> 01:29:41.717
Señor?

01:29:42.377 --> 01:29:44.379
Nah, you keep that,
Nurse Ratched.

01:29:46.798 --> 01:29:48.971
<i>Life is strange</i>

01:29:53.972 --> 01:29:55.144
Sing to me, baby.

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:20.582
Okay, I'm taking
you to the hospital.

01:30:20.665 --> 01:30:22.338
No, no, no.
Rayon.

01:30:22.459 --> 01:30:24.507
No! Rayon!
Trust me you need...

01:30:24.586 --> 01:30:25.929
No!

01:30:30.675 --> 01:30:33.144
I don't wanna die.

01:30:34.346 --> 01:30:36.690
I don't wanna die.
You're not gonna die.

01:30:36.765 --> 01:30:39.109
You're not gonna die, now
just come trust me, c'mon.

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:41.315
C'mon!

01:30:50.445 --> 01:30:52.163
The secretions
the caterpillar uses

01:30:52.238 --> 01:30:54.240
to protect itself during
the incubation period

01:30:55.158 --> 01:30:58.037
act as a non-toxic
antiviral for humans.

01:30:59.537 --> 01:31:00.789
The answer to a question.

01:31:03.041 --> 01:31:04.042
Check this out.

01:31:04.376 --> 01:31:05.878
This is <i>The Lancet</i>
medical review,

01:31:06.002 --> 01:31:09.552
and they published this study
that was conducted in France

01:31:09.673 --> 01:31:13.303
and it proves that AZT alone is
too toxic for most to tolerate,

01:31:13.385 --> 01:31:16.810
and has no lasting effect
on HIV blood levels.

01:31:16.888 --> 01:31:19.732
Now, of course, Avonex
Industries and the NIH,

01:31:19.849 --> 01:31:21.817
they didn't include this study
in their press release.

01:31:21.893 --> 01:31:23.486
Fuck no, they didn't.

01:31:23.561 --> 01:31:27.907
Now these are early trial
results for Fluconazole.

01:31:27.983 --> 01:31:29.235
The anti-fungal?
Yeah.

01:31:29.359 --> 01:31:31.327
Yeah, I read about this.

01:31:31.403 --> 01:31:33.826
Want to take some home?
As much as I can carry.

01:31:41.871 --> 01:31:43.919
You can come in if you want.
Oh, no.

01:31:49.921 --> 01:31:51.923
I took him off it
as you instructed.

01:31:52.007 --> 01:31:53.099
He's just on morphine now.

01:31:53.258 --> 01:31:54.350
Good.

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:07.113
I'll be in my office.

01:32:07.605 --> 01:32:09.107
Thanks for calling.

01:33:24.516 --> 01:33:26.860
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we've just been cleared to land</i>

01:33:26.935 --> 01:33:29.438
<i>at the Dallas-Forth Worth
International Airport.</i>

01:33:29.521 --> 01:33:31.694
<i>Please make sure your seat
belt is securely fastened.</i>

01:33:32.607 --> 01:33:34.655
<i>The flight attendants are currently
passing around the cabin</i>

01:33:34.734 --> 01:33:35.986
<i>to make a final
compliance check</i>

01:33:36.069 --> 01:33:37.742
<i>and pick up any
remaining cups and glasses.</i>

01:33:38.696 --> 01:33:44.044
Walker, Dorsett, Blount,
Newsome, Jeff coat.

01:33:46.287 --> 01:33:47.539
These are patients?

01:33:48.206 --> 01:33:49.378
Yes, sir.

01:33:57.048 --> 01:33:59.847
They're also the names of
players on the Dallas Cowboys.

01:34:02.637 --> 01:34:04.184
No shit?

01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:07.688
That's a hell of a
coincidence, isn't it?

01:34:09.018 --> 01:34:11.316
Ain't this a little ridiculous?
You said it.

01:34:12.230 --> 01:34:14.232
Can you prove
these are patients?

01:34:14.858 --> 01:34:16.656
Can you prove they're not?

01:34:19.696 --> 01:34:21.824
How you doin', Denise?
All right.

01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:27.996
These are the emergencies.

01:34:30.415 --> 01:34:31.587
Where's the idiot?

01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:34.593
I thought you knew.

01:34:36.087 --> 01:34:37.430
The hospital.

01:35:09.871 --> 01:35:11.794
I need security on the
fourth floor right away.

01:35:12.916 --> 01:35:15.044
What d'you say? I can't hear you.

01:35:24.093 --> 01:35:26.221
Mr. Woodroof.
You need to wait outside.

01:35:26.304 --> 01:35:29.057
You son of a bitch.
You murdered him.

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:30.813
Excuse me,
you need to wait outside.

01:35:30.934 --> 01:35:32.811
Murderer. You're a murderer!
Security!

01:35:33.311 --> 01:35:35.655
You call yourself
a doctor? Huh?

01:35:35.730 --> 01:35:38.324
You're a fucking murderer!
Let go of me!

01:35:40.318 --> 01:35:43.822
Don't let him kill you! Don't
let him fucking kill you!

01:35:43.988 --> 01:35:45.490
You're killing them!

01:35:45.573 --> 01:35:47.120
Take him
out of this hospital.

01:35:47.325 --> 01:35:50.579
Don't let him pump
that shit in you!

01:35:50.662 --> 01:35:52.505
You're a fucking murderer!

01:36:47.385 --> 01:36:48.682
Hey?

01:36:49.053 --> 01:36:50.179
Mister?

01:36:53.016 --> 01:36:54.063
Jesus.

01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:14.917
I got the money.

01:37:20.043 --> 01:37:21.386
Excuse me.

01:37:23.254 --> 01:37:26.349
Ron, I got two from
Austin, both on AZT.

01:37:26.424 --> 01:37:28.097
Their insurance is
paying for their treatment,

01:37:28.176 --> 01:37:31.020
but they don't know if
they can afford to switch.

01:37:31.095 --> 01:37:32.267
Hook 'em up.

01:37:33.848 --> 01:37:35.771
We're pretty cash poor.

01:37:40.772 --> 01:37:42.069
Sell the car.

01:38:13.888 --> 01:38:15.936
Anemia, cancer,

01:38:16.015 --> 01:38:18.894
bone marrow depletion,
seizures,

01:38:18.976 --> 01:38:23.072
fever, hearing loss,
impotence, neuropathy.

01:38:23.606 --> 01:38:26.155
Sound like AIDS to you?

01:38:26.234 --> 01:38:32.037
Nah, that there comes in a box of
AZT, a list of the side effects.

01:38:33.866 --> 01:38:35.539
No wonder Rayon is dead.

01:38:35.701 --> 01:38:37.419
Rayon was a drug addict.

01:38:39.205 --> 01:38:41.173
He didn't die
from one day of AZT,

01:38:41.249 --> 01:38:43.718
he died from
the disease as a whole.

01:38:44.377 --> 01:38:46.800
And you stole my
prescription pad, Ron,

01:38:46.963 --> 01:38:49.341
so don't accuse me of
acting irresponsibly.

01:38:51.175 --> 01:38:53.018
Rayon came to
the hospital on his own.

01:38:53.094 --> 01:38:55.096
He got dragged out
in a goddamn garbage bag!

01:38:55.179 --> 01:38:56.897
He was my friend, too!

01:39:14.031 --> 01:39:15.078
<i>Read that.</i>

01:40:22.183 --> 01:40:24.732
I want all my HIV patients
on the asymptomatic study

01:40:24.810 --> 01:40:26.904
to have their AZT doses
lowered to the minimum.

01:40:26.979 --> 01:40:28.322
Six hundred milligrams.

01:40:30.483 --> 01:40:33.578
I got over 3,000 people who need
to get their hands on Peptide T,

01:40:33.653 --> 01:40:34.700
all right, including me.

01:40:34.779 --> 01:40:37.328
I understand. They shut your lab down.
What can I say?

01:40:37.406 --> 01:40:39.829
Look, if I don't get it by the end
of the week, I wanna file a lawsuit.

01:40:39.909 --> 01:40:40.956
C'mon, Ron.

01:40:41.035 --> 01:40:43.629
You lost the restraining
order, remember?

01:40:43.704 --> 01:40:45.206
This is Texas.

01:40:45.289 --> 01:40:46.882
The court system's
your final resort.

01:40:46.958 --> 01:40:48.756
Well, then find a place
where it fucking ain't.

01:40:48.834 --> 01:40:51.713
Go to San Francisco.

01:40:51.796 --> 01:40:54.140
Get me a goddamn sissy judge.
Just figure it out.

01:40:59.136 --> 01:41:00.479
Ten thousand of 'em.

01:41:01.347 --> 01:41:02.348
Perfect.

01:41:14.944 --> 01:41:19.495
I would like to turn it over to my colleague
from the CDC to talk about prevention.

01:41:28.833 --> 01:41:30.801
Mr. Woodroof.

01:41:30.918 --> 01:41:32.636
Would you kindly tell us
what you're doing?

01:41:32.712 --> 01:41:34.714
Oh, I'm just givin' people
information, Richard,

01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:36.882
about this trial I'm in.

01:41:36.966 --> 01:41:38.684
Wanna make sure they
know what's goin' on.

01:41:38.759 --> 01:41:40.261
And what is going on?

01:41:40.344 --> 01:41:43.063
Why d'you cut off
Peptide T, Richard, huh?

01:41:43.139 --> 01:41:46.188
Non-toxic drug that
I got proof works,

01:41:46.267 --> 01:41:47.860
and that the National
Institute of Mental Health,

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:50.313
your own people,
say is completely safe.

01:41:50.396 --> 01:41:51.488
Pass this down.

01:41:51.564 --> 01:41:54.738
Mr. Woodroof, I'm afraid
that you are nothing more

01:41:54.817 --> 01:41:57.616
than a common drug dealer, so if
you'll excuse us, we would like...

01:41:57.695 --> 01:41:58.947
Oh, I'm the drug dealer?

01:41:59.405 --> 01:42:01.373
No, you're
the fucking drug dealer.

01:42:01.449 --> 01:42:03.326
I mean, God damn,
people are dying,

01:42:03.492 --> 01:42:05.369
and y'all are
all up there afraid

01:42:05.453 --> 01:42:08.081
that we're going to find
an alternative without you.

01:42:08.164 --> 01:42:12.715
See, the pharma companies pay
the FDA to push their product.

01:42:13.044 --> 01:42:14.967
So, fuck no, they don't
wanna see my research.

01:42:15.046 --> 01:42:16.468
All right! It's enough!

01:42:16.547 --> 01:42:19.517
I don't have enough cash in my
pocket to make it worth their while.

01:42:19.592 --> 01:42:22.186
Tell you what, I'm gonna be a pain in
your ass until I'm six feet under!

01:42:22.261 --> 01:42:26.357
Maybe one day, you'll get off
your ass and do your fucking job!

01:42:26.432 --> 01:42:28.309
I need you to leave, let's go.

01:42:28.643 --> 01:42:30.816
Here, pass these around,
would you?

01:42:30.895 --> 01:42:32.192
Come on, sir.
Let's go.

01:42:32.355 --> 01:42:33.652
Don't listen to
those cocksuckers.

01:42:42.031 --> 01:42:44.784
We think it is in everyone's
best interest that you resign.

01:42:50.206 --> 01:42:51.549
I won't.

01:42:52.416 --> 01:42:53.838
You'll have to fire me.

01:42:55.294 --> 01:42:56.341
Eve!

01:42:57.713 --> 01:42:58.965
Eve!

01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:01.058
Y'all go fuck yourselves!

01:43:05.346 --> 01:43:06.393
Well...

01:43:15.439 --> 01:43:16.986
One left.

01:43:22.446 --> 01:43:24.699
That took some balls.

01:43:27.535 --> 01:43:30.038
Hey, nice warm hug?

01:43:33.833 --> 01:43:34.959
Yeah.

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:38.759
That's what you need,

01:43:38.838 --> 01:43:41.341
that and a day of
watching bull riding.

01:43:42.842 --> 01:43:45.140
Dr. Woodroof's orders.

01:43:57.648 --> 01:43:59.867
You ever miss
your regular life?

01:44:02.111 --> 01:44:03.784
Regular life?

01:44:04.363 --> 01:44:05.956
What is that?

01:44:07.074 --> 01:44:08.701
It doesn't exist.

01:44:10.536 --> 01:44:12.038
Yeah, I guess.

01:44:14.165 --> 01:44:15.963
No, no, I just...

01:44:17.334 --> 01:44:18.711
I just wanna...

01:44:18.794 --> 01:44:20.216
What?

01:44:23.132 --> 01:44:26.227
Ice cold beer, bull ride again.

01:44:29.221 --> 01:44:31.815
Take my woman dancing,
you know?

01:44:36.687 --> 01:44:37.984
I want kids.

01:44:41.108 --> 01:44:43.657
I mean, I got one
life right? Mine.

01:44:45.821 --> 01:44:48.199
But I want somebody
else's sometimes.

01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:59.551
Sometimes I feel like I'm fighting
for a life I ain't got time to live.

01:45:01.879 --> 01:45:03.597
I want it to mean somethin'.

01:45:06.759 --> 01:45:08.511
It does.

01:46:49.737 --> 01:46:51.956
Get out
of the road, jackass!

01:47:04.543 --> 01:47:06.216
Sir! You're in
the middle of the street.

01:47:06.295 --> 01:47:08.798
Step over by your
vehicle right now.

01:47:08.881 --> 01:47:10.178
Step over by your car.

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:12.009
Hey, I got ya!
Sir, step out of the road.

01:47:12.092 --> 01:47:13.890
Hey! I got it!

01:47:13.969 --> 01:47:16.939
Ron, what the hell
is going on, huh?

01:47:17.014 --> 01:47:19.312
D'you understand me?

01:47:19.391 --> 01:47:21.610
C'mon. I'll get you home.

01:48:15.114 --> 01:48:18.118
The constitution,
specifically the Ninth Amendment,

01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:20.168
does not state that
you have the right

01:48:20.244 --> 01:48:23.248
to be mentally healthy
or physically healthy.

01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:25.082
It does state
that you have a right

01:48:25.165 --> 01:48:27.759
to choose your
own medical care,

01:48:28.168 --> 01:48:32.548
but that is interpreted as
medical care that is approved

01:48:32.715 --> 01:48:34.809
by the Food and
Drug Administration.

01:48:34.967 --> 01:48:39.643
Regarding the FDA, the court is highly
disturbed by its bullying tactics

01:48:40.014 --> 01:48:43.609
and direct interference with
a drug whose own agency

01:48:43.684 --> 01:48:45.607
has found to be non-toxic.

01:48:45.686 --> 01:48:48.530
The FDA was formed
to protect people,

01:48:48.605 --> 01:48:50.949
not prevent them
from getting help.

01:48:51.608 --> 01:48:55.488
The law doesn't seem to make
much common sense sometimes.

01:48:55.904 --> 01:48:59.158
And if a person has been found
to be terminally ill,

01:48:59.241 --> 01:49:02.871
they ought to be able to take just
about anything they feel will help,

01:49:04.455 --> 01:49:05.877
but that's not the law.

01:49:06.248 --> 01:49:10.378
Mr. Woodroof, I'm moved to
compassion by your plight,

01:49:10.836 --> 01:49:15.137
but what is lacking here is
legal authority to intervene.

01:49:16.258 --> 01:49:18.932
I'm sorry, this case
is hereby dismissed.

01:49:34.526 --> 01:49:36.870
<i>We lost.</i>

01:49:42.951 --> 01:49:44.168
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:49:59.259 --> 01:50:00.476
What?

01:50:30.374 --> 01:50:32.752
<i>Yes, indeed, the
number one spectator event.</i>

01:50:34.378 --> 01:50:36.551
<i>Let me hear you, c'mon.
Whoop it up.</i>

01:50:36.630 --> 01:50:40.134
<i>Make some noise! It's your
event, the one you paid to see.</i>

01:50:40.217 --> 01:50:42.686
<i>It's bull-riding time!</i>

01:50:42.761 --> 01:50:45.514
<i>We've got a live one!
The great jawbreaker!</i>

01:50:45.848 --> 01:50:47.521
<i>Number 43, Ron Woodroof!</i>

01:50:47.724 --> 01:50:49.021
<i>Give the man a helping hand.</i>

01:50:49.101 --> 01:50:51.945
<i>And now, here's one
of those top bulls,</i>

01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:54.773
<i>the one the cowboys
all wanna ride.</i>

01:50:54.857 --> 01:50:57.110
<i>Ain't no denying,
this one means business.</i>

01:50:57.192 --> 01:50:58.944
<i>It's all about the mind.</i>

01:50:59.027 --> 01:51:01.576
<i>An eight second ride.
Let's go, cowboy!</i>

01:51:01.655 --> 01:51:02.656
<i>Pull that rope!</i>

01:51:21.133 --> 01:51:23.181
<i>Clap your hands, stomp your feet!
Make some noise!</i>

01:51:23.552 --> 01:51:26.055
<i>It's bull ride time!</i>

01:51:27.305 --> 01:51:33.325
