WEBVTT

00:04.792 --> 00:05.667
Gabe?

00:06.500 --> 00:08.709
I asked you to take your clothes upstairs.

00:08.792 --> 00:11.125
Yeah, I said I would.
I just didn't say when.

00:12.709 --> 00:14.458
I don't get you sometimes, you know?

00:14.542 --> 00:15.959
I wash your clothes.

00:16.041 --> 00:17.458
I dry them. I fold them.

00:17.542 --> 00:18.709
I put them in the basket.

00:18.792 --> 00:21.041
All I ask is that you take them upstairs.

00:21.125 --> 00:22.750
I see what's going on here.

00:23.250 --> 00:24.750
Somebody needs a pat on the back.

00:25.125 --> 00:26.583
Hey, you're doing great, mom.

00:28.083 --> 00:30.500
Clothes upstairs now.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.709
Oh. Hold that thought.

00:32.792 --> 00:35.834
Hello. Oh, hey, Lauren.

00:35.917 --> 00:38.166
Yeah, how's it going?
Oh, no, I'm not doing anything.

00:38.250 --> 00:39.375
Don't forget to take your--

00:39.458 --> 00:40.959
Yeah, so what's up?

00:44.125 --> 00:45.500
Yeah, Sure you're cute now.

00:46.250 --> 00:48.125
One day you'll disappoint me too.

Hey! Want to hear some exciting news?

01:47.834 --> 01:50.250
Emmett and I are apartment sitting
for the guy upstairs.

01:50.333 --> 01:51.959
We're taking care of his pet rats.

01:52.041 --> 01:54.375
And the exciting part is?

01:55.583 --> 01:56.959
Somebody trusts me and Emmett.

01:57.041 --> 01:58.625
With rats.

01:58.709 --> 02:00.000
Live rats.

02:02.291 --> 02:05.000
Wait, so you guys aren't gonna be
in your apartment tonight?

02:05.083 --> 02:06.375
That's right. Why?

02:06.500 --> 02:09.125
Well, I was kind of thinking about having
a slumber party.

02:09.208 --> 02:12.083
See, tonight would be my anniversary
with Spencer

02:12.166 --> 02:14.333
but rather than sit around and mope,

02:14.417 --> 02:17.208
I was thinking I should have some fun
with my girls.

02:17.875 --> 02:21.000
and you want me to bring the rats over
to liven up the festivities?

02:23.125 --> 02:25.417
Actually, I was hoping

02:25.500 --> 02:27.500
I could have the slumber party
at your apartment.

02:27.583 --> 02:28.959
Oh, sure. No problem.

02:29.041 --> 02:29.959
Thanks.

02:30.041 --> 02:31.417
You know, we could do it here,

02:31.500 --> 02:34.041
it's just there's so many people around.

02:34.125 --> 02:35.041
Mom?

02:35.166 --> 02:36.625
That's the people I'm talking about.

02:43.250 --> 02:46.000
Unbelievable!

02:47.333 --> 02:48.667
Charlie, look at this.

02:48.750 --> 02:50.250
I can't read, Daddy.

02:50.917 --> 02:51.917
I'm sorry.

02:52.709 --> 02:54.166
Look, this is an ad,

02:54.250 --> 02:55.750
for a new extermination company.

02:56.709 --> 03:00.208
Vern Hardy, formerly of Bob's Bugs-Be-Gone

03:00.250 --> 03:04.166
has opened Vern's Vermin-Be-Vanquished.

03:05.667 --> 03:07.041
Unbelievable.

03:13.208 --> 03:14.333
Hi, Vern.

03:14.417 --> 03:16.125
Hey, what's new?

03:18.083 --> 03:19.041
Yeah, no, no, no.

03:19.125 --> 03:20.875
No. I do accept your resignation.

03:21.959 --> 03:24.667
Hey, this is how you repay me
for 12 years of work?

03:24.750 --> 03:26.083
By stabbing me in the back?

03:27.125 --> 03:28.250
You...

03:28.834 --> 03:30.875
I know killing bugs is an ugly business.

03:30.959 --> 03:33.208
I taught you that.

03:40.583 --> 03:42.417
Now what am I gonna do?

03:42.500 --> 03:43.917
Get someone else.

03:44.417 --> 03:46.500
You know what? For someone who can't read,

03:46.583 --> 03:47.583
you're pretty smart.

03:53.959 --> 03:55.625
Thanks for this, PJ.

03:55.709 --> 03:58.834
You know, tonight I just want to have fun

03:58.917 --> 04:01.333
and not even think about you-know-who

04:01.417 --> 04:03.125
and the fact that it's our you-know-what.

04:03.208 --> 04:04.250
No problem.

04:04.333 --> 04:06.083
Hey, you know, I think the last time
you were here

04:06.166 --> 04:08.375
was when I made that French dinner
for you and Spencer.

04:08.458 --> 04:10.083
Also known as "you-know-who."

04:11.208 --> 04:12.834
That was for your anniversary, wasn't it?

04:12.917 --> 04:14.625
And there's the "you-know-what."

04:16.709 --> 04:17.917
What were you gonna show me?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.959
Okay, first thing, don't touch the D.V.R.

04:21.041 --> 04:22.875
I'm recording a Yacky the Duck marathon.

04:22.959 --> 04:24.083
Very important.

04:24.166 --> 04:26.375
Also, plumbing can be tricky.

04:26.458 --> 04:29.500
Uh, don't use the kitchen sink
and the toilet at the same time.

04:30.041 --> 04:31.417
Bad things will happen.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.291
- Okay.
- Really bad things.

04:33.375 --> 04:35.208
- This one time Emmett was--
- I don't need to know.

04:35.375 --> 04:36.750
Okay, um...

04:36.834 --> 04:38.583
Uh, you're welcome to anything
in the fridge.

04:38.667 --> 04:40.083
Uh, there's not much in there.

04:40.166 --> 04:41.000
Just a banana.

04:41.083 --> 04:42.959
Oh! actually, don't touch the banana.
That's Emmett's.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.000
Got it. Anything else?

04:46.083 --> 04:47.709
Uh, let's see...

04:47.792 --> 04:49.750
Yacky, plumbing, banana...

04:49.834 --> 04:50.875
Nope. We're good.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.208
Thank you.

04:58.125 --> 04:59.834
Hey, Lauren, come on in.

04:59.917 --> 05:01.458
Hi, Mrs. Duncan.

05:01.542 --> 05:03.375
Hi. You must be Charlie.

05:03.458 --> 05:06.500
- Who are you?
- I'm Lauren.

05:06.583 --> 05:07.917
I'm Mrs. Dabney's granddaughter.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.583
But you seem nice.

05:11.542 --> 05:12.583
We're all baffled.

05:13.959 --> 05:16.250
whoa. Whoa.

05:16.333 --> 05:18.083
Laundry basket almost took me down.

05:19.709 --> 05:21.375
What is that doing there?

05:21.458 --> 05:22.792
I, I will be right back.

05:22.875 --> 05:24.041
So sorry.

05:26.041 --> 05:28.875
- Did you see that?
- Unbelievable.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.458
Thank you, Lauren.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.208
You know, with five kids,

05:36.291 --> 05:38.583
I don't always notice
what needs to be put away.

05:38.667 --> 05:40.375
Oh, you're welcome.

05:40.458 --> 05:41.583
It's really funny.

05:41.667 --> 05:44.458
Yeah, there's probably
stuff lying all over this house,

05:44.542 --> 05:45.667
making a mess.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.542
Stuff right here in this room.

05:49.041 --> 05:51.917
- See anything?
- Um, I don't know.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.792
The video games are kinda messy, I guess.

05:54.458 --> 05:56.709
- Huh.
- Okay, I'm back.

05:56.792 --> 05:58.417
Gabe, Lauren and I were just talking.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.750
Uh, what was it you were saying
about the video games?

06:00.834 --> 06:02.291
- That they were messy?
- Messy.

06:02.375 --> 06:04.125
Yes, that's the word that you used.

06:04.917 --> 06:06.250
Oh.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.375
That's my bad.

06:08.375 --> 06:10.125
That's his bad.

06:10.208 --> 06:11.959
You're welcome here any time, Lauren.

06:12.041 --> 06:13.083
Any time at all.

06:17.917 --> 06:18.917
Come in.

06:19.834 --> 06:20.917
Hi, I'm Beau Landry.

06:21.333 --> 06:22.542
I'm here about the job.

06:22.625 --> 06:23.542
Bob Duncan.

06:23.625 --> 06:24.959
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

06:25.041 --> 06:27.083
- Have a seat.
- Here's my resume.

06:27.166 --> 06:28.417
All right.

06:31.041 --> 06:33.208
Well, looks like you just moved here.

06:33.250 --> 06:35.250
Yes, sir, from Hollow Rock, Tennessee.

06:35.375 --> 06:36.625
So why'd you leave?

06:36.709 --> 06:38.500
You ever been to Hollow Rock, Tennessee?

06:39.750 --> 06:41.500
So, uh, what brought you to Denver?

06:41.583 --> 06:42.625
The bus.

06:44.041 --> 06:46.208
No, I'm just messing with you.

06:47.041 --> 06:48.500
My aunt lives in Denver.

06:48.583 --> 06:50.375
So I figure, you know,
while I'm staying with her,

06:50.458 --> 06:53.166
I might as well check it out,
you know, look for a job,

06:53.250 --> 06:54.500
make some money, save for college.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.792
Well, Beau, you seem like a great kid,

06:57.875 --> 06:59.375
but you just...

06:59.500 --> 07:01.417
...you don't have any experience
in the field.

07:01.500 --> 07:05.000
Well, I can't argue that,
but I really want this job, sir.

07:05.750 --> 07:08.500
Ever since I was little,
it's been my dream to be an exterminator.

07:09.083 --> 07:09.959
Really?

07:10.041 --> 07:11.375
No, I'm just messing with you again.

07:11.458 --> 07:14.000
I actually just want a job.

07:14.083 --> 07:15.875
Okay, well.

07:15.959 --> 07:17.667
That's good enough for me, you're hired.

07:17.750 --> 07:18.583
Really?

07:18.667 --> 07:20.166
No, just messing with you.

07:27.959 --> 07:29.917
This is gonna be so much fun.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.166
Too bad Ivy's too sick to be here.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.500
Oh, yeah.

07:33.583 --> 07:34.709
She is sick, right?

07:34.792 --> 07:37.291
'Cause sometimes I get the feeling
she doesn't like me.

07:37.375 --> 07:38.583
Why would you say that?

07:38.709 --> 07:40.125
She told me she doesn't like me.

07:41.959 --> 07:43.333
She told me that too.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.166
Oh, Ivy doesn't like you either?

07:45.250 --> 07:47.083
No, she told me she doesn't like you.

07:49.750 --> 07:52.000
Moving past Ivy, to the fun part.

07:52.709 --> 07:54.959
Okay, have you guys seen Jackson?

07:55.041 --> 07:56.417
The new boy at school?

07:56.500 --> 07:58.959
He is c-u-t-e, cute!

08:00.417 --> 08:01.834
I talked to him at lunch,

08:01.917 --> 08:03.792
but I couldn't tell If he was interested.

08:03.875 --> 08:05.583
How do you know if a boy likes you?

08:05.667 --> 08:07.417
I have so many questions about boys,

08:07.542 --> 08:10.834
like, "Why are they so mean?",
"Why are they so stupid?"

08:10.917 --> 08:12.375
"Why don't I have one?"

08:13.667 --> 08:16.792
Guys, can we please
just not talk about boys tonight?

08:16.875 --> 08:19.000
I'm sorry,
it's just kind of a sore subject.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.500
You're right, Teddy. I'm sorry.

08:22.583 --> 08:24.625
Hello, can i come in?

08:24.709 --> 08:26.166
Ooh! That sounds like a boy!

08:27.875 --> 08:28.959
Come on in.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.333
It's not a boy. It's just my brother.

08:35.250 --> 08:36.458
What are you doing here?

08:36.542 --> 08:38.709
Oh, just double-checking
you're not using the D.V.R.

08:39.625 --> 08:41.041
Oh, and Emmett wants his banana.

08:42.583 --> 08:44.542
Hey, PJ, can I ask you a question?

08:44.625 --> 08:46.458
Sorry, Teddy, this is gonna be about boys.

08:46.542 --> 08:47.792
Go ahead.

08:49.333 --> 08:52.458
Okay, how does a girl know
if a boy likes her?

08:53.333 --> 08:54.333
Oh, that's easy.

08:54.417 --> 08:56.458
It's the way he looks at you
when you first meet.

08:56.542 --> 08:58.083
It seems like time stops

08:58.166 --> 08:59.834
and you're the only two people
in the world.

08:59.917 --> 09:01.917
- Oh!
- I want that.

09:03.583 --> 09:05.083
I had that.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.333
Oh, hey, that reminds me,
Happy Anniversary, sis.

09:08.417 --> 09:10.000
Really?

09:11.041 --> 09:13.000
What? I didn't say Spencer's name.

09:13.083 --> 09:14.250
Oh, dang it!

09:22.667 --> 09:24.917
If you came over to borrow something,
I'm out of it.

09:26.625 --> 09:28.625
Good afternoon to you too.

09:29.625 --> 09:31.834
Actually, I was wondering
if Lauren could come over.

09:31.917 --> 09:33.709
How come you're asking and not Gabe?

09:34.417 --> 09:35.625
What's going on, Amy?

09:35.709 --> 09:37.250
Does something have to be going on

09:37.333 --> 09:41.250
for me to pay a visit to my friend
and neighbor Mrs. Dabney?

09:41.333 --> 09:42.458
Yes.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.041
Yeah, okay, I'm not buying it either.

09:45.917 --> 09:47.709
Okay, here's the deal,

09:47.792 --> 09:50.000
I cannot get Gabe to do his chores,

09:50.083 --> 09:53.333
but whenever Lauren asks him
to do something, he does it,

09:53.417 --> 09:55.625
So can I borrow her for a while?

09:56.834 --> 10:00.625
And why would I let you take advantage
of my precious granddaughter?

10:02.375 --> 10:03.834
Because...

10:04.959 --> 10:06.500
maybe there's something in it for you.

10:07.458 --> 10:09.083
Evil is a two-way street.

10:09.166 --> 10:11.125
Evil? I'm listening.

10:12.625 --> 10:15.667
You could use Gabe to get Lauren
to do her chores.

10:15.750 --> 10:16.750
Ooh.

10:18.041 --> 10:19.375
I thought you'd like it.

10:20.250 --> 10:23.500
So, for instance,
if Gabe were to tell Lauren

10:23.583 --> 10:25.875
that he was embarrassed
about our dirty windows,

10:26.000 --> 10:27.709
she might do something about it.

10:27.792 --> 10:30.000
Gabe's always had
a thing about clean windows.

10:30.083 --> 10:31.250
Ever since he was a baby.

10:32.583 --> 10:34.375
You should come over more often.

10:34.458 --> 10:35.750
Amy: Aww.

10:41.250 --> 10:42.417
Look at this place.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.917
It's hard to believe an apartment
in our building can look this great.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.250
Right? I mean, he has everything we don't.

10:47.834 --> 10:50.667
Nice furniture, cool art, rats.

10:52.125 --> 10:53.542
Emmett: What are the rats' names again?

10:53.625 --> 10:54.834
Peanut Butter and Jelly.

10:54.917 --> 10:55.834
Wow.

10:55.917 --> 10:58.041
Look at Jelly run around the cage.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.959
Man, he's fast.

11:00.041 --> 11:01.625
I bet Peanut Butter's faster.

11:01.709 --> 11:03.959
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

11:04.041 --> 11:05.291
Both: Rat race!

11:12.792 --> 11:14.875
This may be our greatest race ever.

11:14.959 --> 11:16.875
Certainly our weirdest.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.625
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

11:19.208 --> 11:20.166
On your mark,

11:21.000 --> 11:22.500
Get set.

11:22.583 --> 11:23.667
Go!

11:27.959 --> 11:30.125
- What are they doing?
- Guys, the path is clearly marked.

11:30.208 --> 11:32.000
- Where they go? Oh, no.
- No, no, no.

11:32.083 --> 11:33.917
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.333
No, no, no.

11:37.125 --> 11:38.250
Oh, oh, oh!

11:38.333 --> 11:39.625
What? What? What?

11:39.709 --> 11:42.166
- Oh, I got Jelly.
- Where's Peanut Butter?

11:42.542 --> 11:44.250
Well, he's not at the finish line,

11:44.333 --> 11:46.500
so winner!

12:01.542 --> 12:03.709
Wait! Why are we screaming?

12:13.125 --> 12:15.208
How did a rat get in here anyway?

12:15.291 --> 12:17.709
Well, there it is!

12:18.792 --> 12:20.041
Why are you screaming?

12:20.125 --> 12:22.417
Is there a problem with the D.V.R.?

12:22.500 --> 12:24.500
There's a rat in here!

12:24.625 --> 12:26.375
- Both: Yes!
- Whoo!

12:27.542 --> 12:29.208
- Peanut Butter.
- Come here, Peanut Butter.

12:29.291 --> 12:30.750
- Okay, Peanut Butter.
- Come here.

12:39.709 --> 12:41.125
I'm Emmett.

12:41.208 --> 12:42.500
I'm Vonnie.

12:42.583 --> 12:44.250
- Emmett!
- Sorry, sorry.

12:46.875 --> 12:48.458
Did you see that?

12:48.542 --> 12:50.333
He just gave me the look!

12:51.166 --> 12:54.166
You don't want the look from Emmett.
Believe me.

12:55.667 --> 12:57.625
Okay, now where was the last place
you saw the rat?

12:57.709 --> 12:59.667
- Right there.
- Well, he's not there now,

12:59.750 --> 13:01.166
so we know he moved.

13:01.250 --> 13:03.834
That's the kind of thinking
that comes with the look.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.041
We need a plan to catch this rat.

13:07.125 --> 13:08.208
Okay, I think I got one.

13:08.291 --> 13:10.208
You go upstairs,
grab all the cheese you can find,

13:10.291 --> 13:11.125
crackers too.

13:11.208 --> 13:12.500
- And you bring 'em down here.
- Got it.

13:12.583 --> 13:13.917
And after we've had
our after-breakfast snack,

13:14.000 --> 13:15.333
we'll think of ways to catch that rat.

13:15.375 --> 13:16.542
Emmett: Got it.

13:23.166 --> 13:25.041
Good morning, sir.
Beau Landry ready for work.

13:26.834 --> 13:29.166
I'm sorry.
I guess I didn't make myself clear.

13:29.250 --> 13:30.333
You didn't get the job.

13:31.625 --> 13:33.458
Sir, if I didn't get the job,

13:33.542 --> 13:35.166
then why am I wearing this shirt?

13:37.250 --> 13:38.917
I don't know why.

13:40.125 --> 13:41.375
Mr. Duncan,

13:41.458 --> 13:43.834
I'm a hard worker and I'm reliable.

13:44.625 --> 13:45.500
If you give me a chance,

13:45.583 --> 13:46.792
you won't be disappointed.

13:46.875 --> 13:48.417
Beau, come on.

13:48.500 --> 13:49.625
Look, I--

13:49.709 --> 13:52.083
I really need someone with experience.

13:52.166 --> 13:53.709
Well, this is already my second day.

13:55.208 --> 13:56.667
Come on.

13:56.750 --> 13:58.834
There must've been someone
that gave you your first big break.

14:00.417 --> 14:01.625
Well...

14:01.709 --> 14:03.375
there was old man Witherspoon.

14:04.083 --> 14:05.542
Yeah, there's a story.

14:06.208 --> 14:07.542
I don't suppose you'd want to hear it.

14:07.667 --> 14:09.375
- I'd love to.
- Really?

14:10.959 --> 14:12.625
You want to hear one of my bug stories?

14:12.709 --> 14:14.000
That's never happened before.

14:16.458 --> 14:17.750
You hang on.

14:18.875 --> 14:20.208
- Hello.
- Teddy: Dad, there was a rat!

14:20.291 --> 14:22.041
- Oh, hi, Teddy.
- Teddy: We found it in PJ's apartment!

14:22.125 --> 14:24.583
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What? All right, all right.

14:24.667 --> 14:25.667
I'll be right over.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.250
Well, I guess it's your lucky day.

14:29.333 --> 14:31.417
I'm gonna give you a shot.
We've got a rat situation.

14:31.500 --> 14:34.375
- I'm hired?
- We'll just see how the first job goes.

14:35.458 --> 14:36.667
Oh! Hey, you know what?

14:36.750 --> 14:39.500
On the way over, I'll tell you
the old man Witherspoon story.

14:39.583 --> 14:41.083
Now I kinda have the job, so--

14:41.166 --> 14:42.375
Oh, no, no, no.

14:42.458 --> 14:44.000
You said you'd listen.
There's no take-backs.

14:49.959 --> 14:51.250
These are really dirty.

14:51.375 --> 14:53.000
Seems like
they haven't been washed forever.

14:53.083 --> 14:56.125
Actually,
it was November first, two years ago.

14:56.208 --> 14:58.291
That's pretty specific.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.542
I used to egg her windows every Halloween.

15:02.083 --> 15:03.667
Sweet memories.

15:05.291 --> 15:06.834
So is this clean enough for you?

15:06.959 --> 15:08.333
I guess. Who cares?

15:08.417 --> 15:10.542
You care.
You have a thing about clean windows.

15:10.625 --> 15:12.625
I don't have a thing about clean anything.

15:14.166 --> 15:15.834
That's not what your mom told my grandma.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.875
My mom and Mrs. Dabney were together?

15:22.375 --> 15:24.375
And now we're washing windows?

15:26.041 --> 15:27.542
Yeah, so?

15:27.625 --> 15:29.125
We're being played!

15:29.625 --> 15:32.917
From Mrs. Dabney I can see,
but my own mother?

15:33.458 --> 15:34.959
Actually, I can see that too.

15:40.542 --> 15:42.792
Amy, you are a genius.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.000
I think next week

15:44.083 --> 15:46.375
Lauren's gonna point out
that my garden needs weeding.

15:46.917 --> 15:49.417
And I have a feeling Gabe is gonna think

15:49.500 --> 15:51.500
my laundry room needs repainting.

15:53.166 --> 15:54.625
He does have an eye for that.

16:00.875 --> 16:04.417
Wow. Your evil laugh
is a lot better than mine.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.083
I've been doing it a lot longer.

16:08.709 --> 16:11.208
They're laughing now,
but we'll see who's laughing later.

16:11.250 --> 16:13.709
- So what are we gonna do?
- I don't know yet,

16:13.792 --> 16:15.917
but whatever it is,
it's gonna end in evil laughing.

16:20.583 --> 16:22.709
I swear Emmett gave me the look.

16:22.792 --> 16:24.834
And we're back to that.

16:24.917 --> 16:27.458
Oh, and I gave the look back to him.

16:27.542 --> 16:29.834
We're so getting married.

16:31.583 --> 16:33.291
He didn't give you the look.

16:33.375 --> 16:34.917
He looked at you.

16:35.041 --> 16:36.375
There's a difference.

16:37.041 --> 16:39.291
I guess somebody
doesn't want to be a bridesmaid.

16:41.458 --> 16:42.792
I don't either.

16:45.375 --> 16:47.250
Okay, cavalry is here.

16:48.542 --> 16:50.542
Girls, maybe you should wait
in the bathroom.

16:51.667 --> 16:53.250
Well, what if the rat's in there?

16:53.333 --> 16:54.834
Then they'll scream
and we'll know where the rat is.

16:54.917 --> 16:55.750
Mm.

16:55.834 --> 16:58.500
- What?
- Uh, nothing. Nothing.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.792
- Ready to go.
- Who's this?

17:03.875 --> 17:06.000
This is Beau, giving him a little try-out.

17:06.083 --> 17:07.667
- Beau, this is my son, PJ.
- Hey.

17:07.750 --> 17:10.291
Oh, whoa. No, no, no traps.

17:10.375 --> 17:11.709
Dad, you can't kill this rat.

17:11.792 --> 17:13.750
Well, then what did you call
an exterminator for?

17:13.834 --> 17:16.333
Oh, I thought you were
a pest control specialist.

17:16.417 --> 17:18.125
I stopped saying that years ago.

17:18.208 --> 17:19.375
Who was I kidding?

17:20.792 --> 17:23.625
- Why can't we use the traps?
- Because he's a pet.

17:24.166 --> 17:25.917
His name's Peanut Butter.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.792
Someone trusted me with him
and then I raced him...

17:29.542 --> 17:30.917
Like I always do.

17:32.458 --> 17:34.250
Do you happen to have
any real peanut butter?

17:34.834 --> 17:36.125
Well, yeah, why?

17:36.208 --> 17:39.333
Well, I figure,
if his name's Peanut Butter,

17:39.417 --> 17:40.667
maybe he likes peanut butter.

17:43.125 --> 17:44.959
Dad is this gonna work?

17:46.208 --> 17:47.750
No, of course not.

17:48.750 --> 17:50.750
But you know what? This is good.

17:50.834 --> 17:52.417
Because we all learn from trial and--

17:52.500 --> 17:54.458
Bob: there he is!

18:00.500 --> 18:01.959
- There you go.
- Oh, thank you.

18:02.041 --> 18:04.250
Oh, Peanut Butter, you had me so worried.

18:06.709 --> 18:08.291
Not bad, kid.

18:08.375 --> 18:09.750
Not bad.

18:09.834 --> 18:11.375
You know what? Welcome aboard.

18:12.208 --> 18:13.750
All right.

18:14.333 --> 18:16.583
Hey, girls, You can come out now.

18:17.583 --> 18:19.250
Oh, hey, Beau,

18:19.333 --> 18:21.750
this is, uh, Vonnie And Kelsey.

18:21.834 --> 18:22.834
Both: Hi.

18:22.917 --> 18:25.208
And, uh, that's my daughter Teddy.

18:34.792 --> 18:36.875
- Hi.
- Hey.

18:38.208 --> 18:40.875
Now that was the look.

18:49.208 --> 18:50.625
Hey, what are you doing here?

18:50.709 --> 18:52.083
I thought you were getting together
with Lauren.

18:52.166 --> 18:53.667
Oh, we broke up.

18:53.750 --> 18:56.667
What? Wha, what happened?

18:57.375 --> 18:58.792
She's nice and all.

18:58.875 --> 19:00.709
It's just she started getting all bossy.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.500
Kept asking me to do chores and stuff.

19:04.875 --> 19:06.125
Gabe...

19:07.333 --> 19:08.875
this is all my fault.

19:08.959 --> 19:10.583
- What?
- Okay, look,

19:10.667 --> 19:13.458
Mrs. Dabney and I used you and Lauren

19:13.542 --> 19:15.542
to get each other
to do things around the house.

19:16.041 --> 19:17.291
How could you do that?

19:17.375 --> 19:20.000
Well, it was more Mrs. Dabney than me.

19:21.083 --> 19:23.291
I can't believe you ruined
my first relationship.

19:23.375 --> 19:24.458
I feel terrible.

19:24.542 --> 19:27.417
I-- I just-- is there anything I can do,
Anything at all to make you feel better?

19:30.834 --> 19:32.125
I-- I could eat.

19:33.458 --> 19:35.000
Okay, I'll make you a sandwich.

19:35.083 --> 19:36.208
Eh.

19:37.667 --> 19:39.000
You know what might help?

19:40.041 --> 19:44.542
Lasagna.
From, from the nice Italian place.

19:44.625 --> 19:46.166
That's all the way across town.

19:46.250 --> 19:47.667
My first relationship, Mom.

19:47.750 --> 19:48.917
I'm leaving now.

19:58.250 --> 20:00.208
- Hey.
- Hey, how's it working over there?

20:00.291 --> 20:01.250
Hang on.

20:01.333 --> 20:02.625
Here you go, honey.

20:02.709 --> 20:04.375
Grandma's so sorry for what she did.

20:07.458 --> 20:09.041
Working like a charm.

20:14.625 --> 20:15.500
Hey, Charlie.

20:15.583 --> 20:20.125
So today's life lesson
is about sleepovers,

20:20.208 --> 20:23.458
as in don't have them at PJ's apartment.

20:24.667 --> 20:25.917
Wait, what am I saying?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.500
When you're my age,
PJ's gonna be, like, 30.

20:29.041 --> 20:31.500
He can't still be living
with Emmett, can he?

20:33.083 --> 20:34.208
My advice stands.

20:37.583 --> 20:40.583
In other news, Dad hired a new guy...

20:41.750 --> 20:43.041
Beau...

20:43.125 --> 20:45.834
And... I met him.

20:45.917 --> 20:47.166
And...

20:48.709 --> 20:50.250
that's all I wanna say about that.

20:52.333 --> 20:53.959
Hey, honey, have you seen Gabe?

20:54.041 --> 20:56.750
I made him one of those fruit smoothies
he loves so much.

20:56.834 --> 20:59.000
Oh, I think he went somewhere with Lauren.

21:00.500 --> 21:01.458
With Lauren?

21:02.375 --> 21:03.834
They're still together?

21:05.125 --> 21:06.750
Well, they were holding hands.

21:08.709 --> 21:10.625
You know what goes well with a smoothie?

21:11.917 --> 21:13.166
Revenge.

21:17.458 --> 21:21.291
Well, Gabe's gonna need
some good luck, Charlie.

21:26.208 --> 21:28.667
Hey. So what's the big emergency?

21:28.750 --> 21:30.417
I was taking care of my neighbor's bird,

21:30.500 --> 21:32.750
And as usual, I lost him.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.208
Well, so what do you need me for?

21:35.291 --> 21:38.000
Well, remember how we used peanut butter
to catch Peanut Butter?

21:38.083 --> 21:40.041
I think the same thing might work
with the bird.

21:40.125 --> 21:41.792
- What's the bird's name?
- Bob.

21:41.875 --> 21:44.500
That's ridiculous!

21:44.583 --> 21:46.458
I think his given name is Robert.

21:47.792 --> 21:49.208
Makes sense to me

21:49.250 --> 21:50.542
That's not what I meant.

21:50.625 --> 21:52.417
Will you please
just go stand by the window?

21:52.500 --> 21:54.083
Fine.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.792
But I'm telling you this isn't gonna work.
