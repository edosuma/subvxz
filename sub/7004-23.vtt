00:01.834 --> 00:03.234
It's springtime
here on <i>tool time,</i> al.
You know what that means.

00:03.235 --> 00:05.070
Yes, I do, tim.

00:05.071 --> 00:08.907
It means you're
having me clean your
patio furniture again.

00:08.908 --> 00:10.541
Boy, it's a mess this year.

00:10.542 --> 00:13.678
There are simple solutions
for taking paint and rust
off that chair.

00:13.679 --> 00:15.346
Although one solution
would be

00:15.347 --> 00:17.515
Not to leave your furniture
out all winter.

00:19.619 --> 00:21.285
Then we wouldn't have
any rust,

00:21.286 --> 00:25.824
We wouldn't have a show,
and you wouldn't have what, al?

00:25.825 --> 00:28.159
A very small paycheck.

00:30.395 --> 00:32.396
The first step
in restoring that furniture

00:32.397 --> 00:34.633
Is to take off
as much surface rust
as possible.

00:34.634 --> 00:38.069
That's right. You can
do that with a wire brush,
with a sanding cord,

00:38.070 --> 00:40.471
Or steel wool,
which I prefer.

00:40.472 --> 00:42.907
It's slow,
but it's very cost-efficient.

00:42.908 --> 00:46.277
I hate the word "slow."

00:46.278 --> 00:49.480
That's why I
just chuck an abrasive wheel
onto my drill and let her fly.

00:52.718 --> 00:56.721
Of course, you always
want to check the chuck
before you turn it on.

00:56.722 --> 00:59.357
Let's just chuck
the chuck, ok?

00:59.358 --> 01:01.359
Move on to a more
powerful method -

01:01.360 --> 01:03.427
The binford 6100 series
orbital sander.

01:03.428 --> 01:06.330
<i>(motor whirs)</i>
oh!

01:06.331 --> 01:08.499
It's great
for the large areas -

01:08.500 --> 01:11.636
The back of the chair,
the bottom of the chair,
or the bottom of al.

01:15.574 --> 01:17.909
All right. Another method
of rust removal

01:17.910 --> 01:20.979
Would be to dissolve it
with naval jelly.

01:20.980 --> 01:22.981
I dunno. You got jelly
coming out of your navel,

01:22.982 --> 01:25.650
You got bigger problems
than a rusty chair.

01:28.087 --> 01:32.824
But I got a method that'll
outshine your wire brushes,
flosses, ointments, salves.

01:32.825 --> 01:36.728
Put 'em all to shame.
Heidi, my hot-air gun, please.

01:36.729 --> 01:38.362
Here you go, tim.

01:38.363 --> 01:40.098
Thank you, heidi.

01:40.099 --> 01:43.634
A hot-air gun
does not remove rust.
It removes paint.

01:43.635 --> 01:46.071
This one does both. I made
a few little adjustments.

01:46.072 --> 01:48.606
This'll take the paint
off a battleship.

01:48.607 --> 01:51.642
Something
a lot of our viewers
have on their patio.

01:53.445 --> 01:55.479
Just back off.

01:56.882 --> 01:58.917
I mean, maybe they use
battleships, al.

01:58.918 --> 02:04.522
I know. Yes.
Fine. Ok.

02:08.393 --> 02:09.794
Huh?

02:09.794 --> 02:11.629
No rust. No paint.

02:11.630 --> 02:13.231
No chair.

03:02.781 --> 03:04.649
<i>(tim)</i> all right. Bolts off?

03:04.650 --> 03:06.985
<i>(brad)</i> mine's rusted on.

03:06.986 --> 03:09.954
We need the pneumatic wrench.
Or I'll get a hot-air gun.

03:09.955 --> 03:13.357
<i>(all)</i> oh, no. No way!

03:13.358 --> 03:17.095
Just making sure you guys
still watch <i>tool time.</i>

03:17.096 --> 03:20.198
Guess what. My sister carrie
is coming to visit.

03:20.199 --> 03:22.600
<i>(all)</i> oh, no.

03:22.601 --> 03:24.435
Come on. Carrie's fun.

03:24.436 --> 03:27.471
She always
brings you nice gifts
from someplace exotic.

03:27.472 --> 03:33.178
Oh, yeah.
Last year, she brought us
knee socks and lederhosen.

03:33.179 --> 03:36.014
Hey, I liked
the lederhosen.

03:36.015 --> 03:38.649
Now all you need
is some pantyhosen.

03:40.385 --> 03:44.155
Tim, do you
have to groan every time
carrie's coming to town?

03:44.156 --> 03:47.558
Yes, because
I know what will happen.
She'll make some remarks.

03:47.559 --> 03:49.560
You'll think
she's criticizing you.

03:49.561 --> 03:51.562
You'll get real upset
and end up criticizing me.

03:51.563 --> 03:55.533
I don't need my sister
to come to town
to criticize you.

03:55.534 --> 03:58.102
Besides, I love carrie.

03:58.103 --> 04:00.371
I'm just not gonna
let her push my buttons.

04:00.372 --> 04:02.040
I've heard this before.

04:02.041 --> 04:04.475
The same thing you said
when your sister robin
came for easter,

04:04.476 --> 04:06.444
When your parents
came for christmas

04:06.445 --> 04:08.446
And weird aunt betty
came for thanksgiving.

04:08.447 --> 04:10.215
Your point
would be what?

04:10.216 --> 04:12.984
You have a problem
with relatives or holidays.

04:14.286 --> 04:16.286
Carrie and I
are gonna be just fine.

04:16.288 --> 04:19.123
I haven't seen her in so long.
I'm looking forward to Saturday.

04:19.124 --> 04:22.360
Saturday? Perfect.
I won't be here all day.

04:22.361 --> 04:25.363
I'm helping marty and nancy
move into their new house.

04:25.364 --> 04:27.365
That's happening Saturday?

04:27.366 --> 04:30.301
You can't leave me
with alone carrie.
She drives me crazy.

04:33.405 --> 04:35.439
Your sister
is a freelance
photographer?

04:35.440 --> 04:37.508
Yeah. She travels
all over the world.

04:37.509 --> 04:41.445
She knows how to tell people
to "say cheese" in 32 languages.

04:41.446 --> 04:44.715
She sounds like
a real cheese whiz.

04:44.716 --> 04:46.550
<i>(cries)</i>

04:46.551 --> 04:48.419
Oh, we'll be right back.

04:48.420 --> 04:51.589
She is amazing.
This job that she has
just fell into her lap.

04:51.590 --> 04:53.591
She's one of those people

04:53.592 --> 04:56.227
Who's always
in the right place
at the right time.

04:56.228 --> 04:59.563
If she were
to lose her balance
stepping off a curb,

04:59.564 --> 05:01.866
Robert redford
would be there
to help her.

05:01.867 --> 05:05.136
That actually happened.
Really.

05:05.137 --> 05:07.205
So are you and your sister
close?

05:07.206 --> 05:09.473
Yeah. We get along
really well.

05:09.474 --> 05:12.210
Sometimes. Sort of.

05:12.211 --> 05:14.779
Not really.

05:14.780 --> 05:16.847
She just drives me crazy.

05:16.848 --> 05:20.518
My sister and I used to
drive each other crazy, too,
but we worked it out.

05:20.519 --> 05:21.819
What did you do?

05:21.820 --> 05:25.589
We stopped talking
to each other.

05:25.590 --> 05:28.927
I really envy marty and tim.
They're so close.

05:28.928 --> 05:31.462
You idiot.
You big idiot.

05:31.463 --> 05:33.731
Stop calling me an idiot,
will you, please?

05:33.732 --> 05:37.201
If you'd
stop acting like an idiot,
I'd stop calling you an idiot.

05:37.202 --> 05:40.204
Big fat idiot.
I heard that.

05:40.205 --> 05:43.408
All right, guys.
Come in this way.
Watch the door.

05:43.409 --> 05:44.909
What's going on here?

05:44.910 --> 05:46.644
Why are
the moving men here?

05:46.645 --> 05:48.980
I had a guy to refinish
our floors, right?

05:48.981 --> 05:52.350
Tim said he had a better guy.
He's a bigger idiot than tim.

05:52.351 --> 05:55.753
No one's a bigger idiot
than me.

05:55.754 --> 05:57.989
The floors aren't gonna
be dry for two days,

05:57.990 --> 05:59.991
And the movers gotta
unload the truck.

05:59.992 --> 06:02.593
Here in the house?
Yeah, 'cause of my brother.

06:02.594 --> 06:04.295
The idiot?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.034
Marty, I was
just trying to help.

06:10.035 --> 06:15.039
If you wanna help,
just butt out of my life,
will you, you big butthead?

06:15.040 --> 06:19.310
Hi-hi! Guess who's here
and can stay a week.

06:19.311 --> 06:20.544
A week?

06:20.545 --> 06:23.081
Oh, jill, you look great.

06:23.082 --> 06:26.484
So wholesome,
like an ad for oatmeal.

06:26.485 --> 06:30.388
Nobody can pull off that
suburban-housewife look
like my big sis.

06:30.389 --> 06:32.656
Tim, a whole week.

06:32.657 --> 06:35.293
Timmy! Come on over here
and give me a big wet one.

06:37.963 --> 06:40.365
Carrie, I don't think
you've met my wife.

06:40.366 --> 06:42.033
I don't think I've met you.

06:42.034 --> 06:45.103
Actually, you have.
A couple... Eight, nine times.

06:45.104 --> 06:49.240
Marty and nancy.
And these are their twins -
claire and gracie.

06:49.241 --> 06:53.144
Oh! Brothers,
babies, boxes.

06:53.145 --> 06:55.013
I love this.

06:55.014 --> 06:59.617
It is so nice to know
that there are still people
like my sister

06:59.618 --> 07:03.087
Leading
their simple little lives
in their cute little houses,

07:03.088 --> 07:06.624
Making delicious
little meals. Oh...

07:06.625 --> 07:09.760
I hate her little comments.

07:09.761 --> 07:13.464
She's not talking about you.
It must be some other sister.
She said "delicious meals."

07:18.904 --> 07:20.304
Say cheese.

07:20.305 --> 07:21.839
Cheese.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.607
Oh, perfect.

07:23.608 --> 07:25.709
You know, I brought those
to you all the way
from thailand.

07:25.710 --> 07:27.378
You put them
on your fingers,

07:27.379 --> 07:30.248
And you do the
traditional thai dance
called the fon leb.

07:30.249 --> 07:33.418
We are a fon leb-bing
bunch of guys.

07:35.687 --> 07:38.456
Hey, mark, come on!
Let's see what you look like
in your present.

07:42.161 --> 07:44.929
I really don't know
about this.

07:44.930 --> 07:46.830
We do.

07:48.067 --> 07:52.002
Oh, it looks darling
on you, sweetheart.

07:52.003 --> 07:55.506
If I were you,
I'd go change, <i>sweetheart.</i>

07:56.508 --> 07:58.909
Oh, cute robe, mark.

07:58.910 --> 08:00.478
Yeah, right.

08:01.947 --> 08:05.149
So, did the boys
like their presents?

08:05.150 --> 08:08.252
Oh, yeah, they love them.
I hope tim likes his kimono.

08:08.253 --> 08:10.488
Well, I guarantee
he'll like it

08:10.489 --> 08:14.658
As much as that kilt
you gave him last year.

08:14.659 --> 08:18.028
Do you have to photograph me
folding socks?

08:18.029 --> 08:19.630
Jill, I'm a photographer.

08:19.631 --> 08:22.833
I love taking pictures
of people in their element.

08:22.834 --> 08:25.536
Folding socks
is my element?

08:25.537 --> 08:29.340
No. I mean you're
taking care of your family.
That's terrific.

08:29.341 --> 08:31.709
In fact, I'm thinking
maybe one day

08:31.710 --> 08:35.379
I'd like a family
to take care of.

08:35.380 --> 08:37.815
Really? I've never heard you
talk like that before.

08:37.816 --> 08:41.452
Yeah, well, that's
one of the reasons
I came to visit.

08:41.453 --> 08:44.655
I wanted to take
a close-up look
at marriage,

08:44.656 --> 08:49.093
See what it's like
day in, day out, make sure
it's not too mundane for me.

08:49.094 --> 08:52.363
Oh. So this is like
you're visiting a museum,

08:52.364 --> 08:55.600
And I'm
the boring sister
exhibit.

08:55.601 --> 08:59.303
Oh, no. I just wanna see how
you put up with your life.

08:59.304 --> 09:02.406
I don't put up with my life.
I like my life.
Of course you do.

09:02.407 --> 09:05.843
You know, I've gone back
to school. I have great kids.

09:06.845 --> 09:09.447
Well... A great marriage.

09:09.448 --> 09:11.782
Oh, yeah. I know.
Tim is great.

09:11.783 --> 09:14.385
I could see myself
with a guy like him.

09:14.386 --> 09:18.456
On the other hand,
I just wanna make sure
I don't settle.

09:18.457 --> 09:20.591
Like I did for tim?

09:20.592 --> 09:22.226
No, I didn't say that.

09:22.227 --> 09:24.328
Well, that's what you implied.

09:24.329 --> 09:27.331
Right after you told me
my life was mundane.

09:27.332 --> 09:31.502
You know, you are being
very self-centered.

09:31.503 --> 09:33.204
Me, self-centered?

09:33.205 --> 09:35.339
Yes. We're supposed
to be talking about me.

09:38.310 --> 09:40.811
You know, I happen
to be at a crossroads here,

09:40.812 --> 09:43.013
And I try to talk to you
about it,

09:43.014 --> 09:46.784
And all you can do is yell at me
and fold your stupid socks.

09:46.785 --> 09:49.720
Well, you act like
all my life is is socks.

09:49.721 --> 09:51.955
Hey, honey,
got any clean socks?

09:53.659 --> 09:55.459
All right.

09:58.230 --> 10:00.231
Tim, you took
a big step today

10:00.232 --> 10:02.433
Admitting that you were wrong
about the floor guy.

10:02.434 --> 10:05.536
Putting me in a headlock
didn't hurt.

10:05.537 --> 10:09.873
Well, nancy wanted me
to resolve my fight with you
by talking about my feelings.

10:11.310 --> 10:13.911
I really appreciate
that you didn't go that way.

10:16.515 --> 10:18.516
Marty, I can't find
farmer fred.

10:18.517 --> 10:20.251
Who's farmer fred?

10:20.252 --> 10:23.787
This stuffed toy
we use to get the kids
to fall asleep.

10:23.788 --> 10:27.625
Yeah, you know,
you pull his pitchfork,
he makes barnyard sounds.

10:27.626 --> 10:30.761
"moo" goes the cow
and "quack, quack, quack"
goes the duck...

10:30.762 --> 10:34.198
Marty, I got the idea.

10:34.199 --> 10:36.367
You remember where
you packed him?

10:36.368 --> 10:39.036
Sure, I know. Go ahead.
I'll bring him right on up.

10:39.037 --> 10:40.238
Thanks.

10:43.242 --> 10:47.177
<i>(snickers)</i>

10:47.178 --> 10:49.680
You have no idea
where you put him.
No.

10:50.882 --> 10:52.883
Do me a favor, will you?
You look out here.

10:52.884 --> 10:56.153
I'll check the boxes
in the garage.

10:58.557 --> 11:01.726
My sister is impossible.
She's been following me
all day,

11:01.727 --> 11:05.129
Snapping pictures
and making condescending
remarks about my life.

11:05.130 --> 11:07.197
But the thing that
really made me mad...

11:07.198 --> 11:09.634
She says the reason
she's staying a whole week

11:09.635 --> 11:12.637
Is so she can observe
how miserable our lives are.

11:12.638 --> 11:14.705
It won't take a week.

11:22.847 --> 11:25.483
What's that supposed to mean?
You think our lives
are miserable?

11:25.484 --> 11:29.052
Of course not. I'm joking.
I'm trying to cheer you up.

11:29.053 --> 11:31.589
Well, I'm upset.
It's no time to cheer me up.

11:31.590 --> 11:36.126
Got it. I'll wait
till you're in a good mood,
then I'll try to cheer you up.

11:36.127 --> 11:39.196
I don't know why I talk to you.
Couldn't you be supportive?

11:39.197 --> 11:43.100
All right, all right.
I know it's horrible
having a sister like carrie.

11:43.101 --> 11:46.437
From the moment
I met her, I realized
she's an obnoxious woman.

11:46.438 --> 11:49.940
Why are you attacking
my sister?

11:49.941 --> 11:53.444
I thought that's what
we were doing.

11:53.445 --> 11:56.880
I can trash her because
I'm doing it out of love.

11:56.881 --> 11:58.982
Besides, she does have
a few good points.

11:58.983 --> 12:01.452
First time I met her,
she was delightful.

12:01.453 --> 12:03.454
She's attractive, fun,
the kids love her.

12:03.455 --> 12:04.822
She's got a good job.

12:04.823 --> 12:07.425
Please don't go that far.

12:07.426 --> 12:10.728
From now on, you tell me
how far you want me to go,
and I'll go there.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.335
<i>(♪ thai)</i>

12:19.338 --> 12:21.339
Wilson, what are you doing?

12:21.340 --> 12:24.508
Well, hidey-ho,
neighborette.

12:26.010 --> 12:28.546
See, I am dancing
the fon leb.

12:28.547 --> 12:33.818
Your boys gave me
these nails as a gift.
They are so thoughtful.

12:33.819 --> 12:37.287
Did they also give you
some litchi nuts?
Yes, indeedy.

12:37.288 --> 12:40.858
I even nibbled on some while
I was trying on the kimono
that tim gave me.

12:42.828 --> 12:45.363
My family has always believed

12:45.364 --> 12:47.998
It's better to give than keep
anything my sister gave them.

12:47.999 --> 12:50.401
Oh, so the gifts
came from carrie?

12:50.402 --> 12:52.202
Mm-hmm.

12:52.203 --> 12:54.271
She is such
an interesting woman.

12:54.272 --> 12:57.575
Could I talk to wilson?
I got a couple of minutes
before I go to work.

12:57.576 --> 12:59.643
You'll have to wait.
I can't wait.

12:59.644 --> 13:02.847
I'm sorry,
we only have one wilson,
and I'm using him.

13:05.517 --> 13:08.619
You know, neighbors,
I am a friend.
I'm not a rest room.

13:11.289 --> 13:13.023
I'm sorry, wilson.

13:13.024 --> 13:16.660
Tim, I know you wanna
talk to wilson about me,
but I was here first.

13:16.661 --> 13:20.130
Well, hurry up. I don't know
how long I can hold it.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.835
So, jill, what did you
want to talk about?

13:24.836 --> 13:26.404
Carrie.

13:26.405 --> 13:29.172
You know, when we were kids,
we were so close.

13:29.173 --> 13:31.609
We shared a room,
we told each other everything.

13:31.610 --> 13:33.811
Now when we get together,
all we do is fight.

13:33.812 --> 13:35.178
Why do you think that is?

13:35.179 --> 13:36.847
I don't know.

13:36.848 --> 13:40.384
Ever since high school,
we've just been going
in different directions.

13:40.385 --> 13:42.386
Well, sometimes
it is difficult

13:42.387 --> 13:44.622
To find a way back
to each other.

13:44.623 --> 13:49.326
Maybe I just need
to face the fact that we're
never gonna be close again.

13:49.327 --> 13:51.529
Well, jill, I wouldn't
give up hope just yet.

13:51.530 --> 13:55.933
I'm reminded of the
19th-century english poet
christina rossetti,

13:55.934 --> 14:00.304
Who wrote, "there is
no friend like a sister
in calm or stormy weather.

14:00.305 --> 14:02.306
"to cheer on the tedious way,

14:02.307 --> 14:05.042
To fetch one
if one goes astray."

14:05.043 --> 14:08.345
Hmm. Wait, which one of us
is going astray?

14:08.346 --> 14:11.181
Well, if you lose
the relationship,
maybe both of you.

14:14.285 --> 14:18.556
Just great.
Look at the time. Huh?

14:18.557 --> 14:22.593
Now it's off to work I go
without my "hidey-ho."

14:29.935 --> 14:32.703
Welcome back to
"spring spruce up week"
for your backyard.

14:32.704 --> 14:35.205
We're gonna show you
how to maintain
your wooden deck.

14:35.206 --> 14:37.608
It's a heck of a deck.
This deck is a wreck.

14:37.609 --> 14:39.309
Really? Let's check.

14:39.310 --> 14:41.345
Marv, if you wanna
come on in here.

14:41.346 --> 14:44.482
As you can see,
we have a sagging beam
that needs to be reinforced.

14:44.483 --> 14:48.486
Now, the best way to do that
is to sister a matching beam
right next to it.

14:48.487 --> 14:53.056
Wait a minute.
What is it with women
and their sisters fighting?

14:53.057 --> 14:54.825
Why can't they fight like men?

14:54.826 --> 14:57.528
Tim, what does this
have to do with decks?

14:57.529 --> 14:59.196
Follow me on this.

14:59.197 --> 15:02.032
When two brothers are fighting,
one gets decked, fight's over.

15:04.769 --> 15:07.371
I believe you're making
a gross generalization.

15:07.372 --> 15:11.241
My brother and I have never
resorted to physical violence
to resolve an argument.

15:11.242 --> 15:15.980
Come on. There was never
a punch thrown between
little cal and little al?

15:15.981 --> 15:18.315
No. We always settled
our differences

15:18.316 --> 15:21.184
With compromise
and a nice cup of tea.

15:23.522 --> 15:24.989
Get real.

15:24.990 --> 15:27.324
You wanna ask him yourself?
He's backstage.

15:27.325 --> 15:29.059
Your brother's here?

15:29.060 --> 15:32.262
Yes, he is. He flew in
for mother's birthday.
<i>(applause)</i>

15:32.263 --> 15:33.564
Thank you.

15:35.466 --> 15:37.467
I'll relay
your well wishes
to her

15:37.468 --> 15:40.671
When we
take her out for her
birthday smorgasbord.

15:40.672 --> 15:42.873
Good luck
getting her attention.

15:44.910 --> 15:49.547
Well... I think the audience
would like to meet al's brother.
Wouldn't you?

15:49.548 --> 15:50.948
<i>(all)</i> yeah!

15:50.949 --> 15:54.284
All right. Let's give a big,
warm <i>tool time</i> welcome

15:54.285 --> 15:58.155
For cal "he's gotta be
better-looking than al" borland.

15:58.156 --> 16:00.090
<i>(applause)</i>

16:17.108 --> 16:19.677
I don't see any
family resemblance, do you?

16:21.312 --> 16:24.448
Well, actually,
I take after father,
and cal looks like mother.

16:27.251 --> 16:30.955
And a fine-looking woman
she is.

16:30.956 --> 16:34.592
Come on, cal. You wanna tell us
about growing up with al?

16:34.593 --> 16:36.560
I don't think so, tim.

16:37.963 --> 16:39.930
<i>(snorts)</i>

16:45.269 --> 16:48.438
He's got that
borland humor.

16:48.439 --> 16:52.175
Yeah, the kind
that isn't funny.

16:52.176 --> 16:54.578
It's hard to believe, cal,
that all through your childhood,

16:54.579 --> 16:56.580
You never threw a punch
each other?

16:56.581 --> 16:59.349
That's right.
I never felt the need
to fight al.

16:59.350 --> 17:03.353
As I said, we always
resolved our differences
with a nice cup of tea.

17:03.354 --> 17:06.323
What are you -
the queen mother?

17:06.324 --> 17:08.858
No, but nothing like
a cup of earl grey

17:08.859 --> 17:11.194
To soothe
sibling rivalry.

17:11.194 --> 17:14.131
Of course, I would have
preferred chamomile.

17:14.132 --> 17:16.398
Chamomile? You never
said anything.

17:16.400 --> 17:19.435
Well, you never asked.

17:19.436 --> 17:21.570
Cal, I can't
believe this.

17:21.571 --> 17:23.674
You hold back
on your tea preferences
all these year

17:23.675 --> 17:26.209
And then blurt it out
on my television show?

17:26.210 --> 17:29.146
Your television show?

17:29.147 --> 17:31.481
For another thing,
I'm getting sick and tired

17:31.482 --> 17:34.251
Of you always flaunting
your success.

17:34.252 --> 17:37.154
You're just jealous
because I have
a prestigious career,

17:37.155 --> 17:39.356
And you're just
a lowly physicist!

17:41.660 --> 17:44.695
Boys, television show.
Live audience.

17:47.899 --> 17:50.000
<i>(quacking sounds)</i>

17:52.503 --> 17:54.504
Are you still playing
with those ducks?

17:54.505 --> 17:56.506
You're supposed to be
looking for farmer fred.

17:56.507 --> 17:58.876
They're helping me.

18:01.612 --> 18:03.714
Come on, fellas.

18:08.653 --> 18:10.054
Where are you going?

18:10.055 --> 18:11.855
Oh, jill, listen.

18:11.856 --> 18:15.159
Something came up,
and I have to leave.
Thank you for everything.

18:15.160 --> 18:18.862
Leave? You said
you were gonna stay a week.
What came up?

18:18.863 --> 18:22.733
Uh... An assignment.
It's-it's far away.
I have to fly there.

18:22.734 --> 18:25.769
Please don't go.

18:25.770 --> 18:29.506
I know we got mad
this afternoon, but couldn't you
just stay and talk?

18:29.507 --> 18:32.009
I don't think
that's a great idea.

18:32.010 --> 18:34.978
Every time I open my mouth,
I seem to upset you.

18:34.979 --> 18:38.615
Well, not every time.

18:38.616 --> 18:40.918
I was ok when you came in
and said hello.

18:45.456 --> 18:47.124
Tim.

18:50.061 --> 18:53.063
I love this thing.
It always surprises me.

18:57.468 --> 19:00.337
Look, I didn't mean
to make you feel bad.

19:00.338 --> 19:03.207
I think it's great
that you're happy
being like mom.

19:03.208 --> 19:07.477
Oh, please.
Don't use the "m" word.

19:07.478 --> 19:10.914
Just because you jet around
and you have this glamorous life

19:10.915 --> 19:14.618
And I'm,
well, a wife and a mother,
why does that make me like mom?

19:14.619 --> 19:17.755
Well, why do you assume
I have such a glamorous life?

19:17.756 --> 19:19.757
I mean, I spend
half my time

19:19.758 --> 19:21.759
Trying to figure out
what time zone I'm in.

19:21.760 --> 19:25.595
I've lived in
my apartment for five years,
and I still haven't unpacked.

19:25.596 --> 19:29.466
Do you have any idea
what it's like to live
surrounded by boxes?

19:32.837 --> 19:35.338
Look, I gotta admit it.

19:35.339 --> 19:38.742
I've been really jealous of you.

19:38.743 --> 19:41.511
It was hard for me
when you would call me
and tell me

19:41.512 --> 19:46.416
That you were
photographing mick jagger
under a waterfall in tahiti.

19:46.417 --> 19:49.219
I dreaded that moment
when you'd say,
"what are you up to,"

19:49.220 --> 19:51.521
And all I talked about
was diaper rash.

19:51.522 --> 19:54.191
Yeah, I dreaded
that moment, too.

19:54.192 --> 19:59.930
Maybe one of the reasons
I've been oversensitive
about your comments

19:59.931 --> 20:02.632
Is because you've gotten to do
all those exciting things.

20:02.633 --> 20:05.568
But look what you've got.
Great kids, a great husband.

20:05.569 --> 20:07.404
It's a perfect life.

20:07.405 --> 20:09.973
Well, it's not
a perfect life.

20:09.974 --> 20:11.675
Hey, girls,
remember these?

20:11.676 --> 20:13.476
<i>(squealing)</i>

20:20.384 --> 20:23.320
I rest my case.

20:23.321 --> 20:27.757
Look, jill, I guarantee you,
your life is more satisfying
than my life.

20:27.758 --> 20:30.093
Well, what's wrong
with your life?

20:30.094 --> 20:33.330
I'm just not as happy
as I used to be.

20:33.331 --> 20:36.834
Maybe I need a new career.
Maybe a husband.

20:36.835 --> 20:40.971
Maybe I should just
go spend some time
with the dalai lama,

20:40.972 --> 20:45.209
Who, by the way, hates it
when you walk up to him
and go, "hello, dalai."

20:46.610 --> 20:48.611
You know...

20:48.612 --> 20:50.848
Whatever it is
you're looking for,
I'm sure you'll find it.

20:50.849 --> 20:52.716
How can you be so sure?

20:52.717 --> 20:55.485
You fell off a curb,
and robert redford
caught you.

20:55.486 --> 20:57.487
Well, that's true.
Which reminds me...

20:57.488 --> 20:59.622
Bob left a message
on my machine the other week,

20:59.623 --> 21:01.524
And I never called him back.

21:01.525 --> 21:04.461
Bob? I hate you so much.

21:06.564 --> 21:10.500
Look, if you really wanna
make some changes in your life,

21:10.501 --> 21:15.272
You're
just gonna have to slow down
and think about what you want.

21:15.273 --> 21:17.074
And...

21:17.075 --> 21:20.377
If you wanna talk to me,

21:20.378 --> 21:23.213
I would love it
if you would call me.
I'm here.

21:23.214 --> 21:24.381
Thank you.

21:26.417 --> 21:28.651
I cannot find farmer fred,

21:28.652 --> 21:32.322
But I did find something
my parents put in my crib
to put me to sleep -

21:32.323 --> 21:34.057
Baby's first ratchet.
