00:36.368 --> 00:40.437
<i>Those who survived
mobilized their settlements</i>

00:40.439 --> 00:45.677

00:47.646 --> 00:53.549

00:53.551 --> 00:58.855
<i>and the strong grew

<i>Osh alga kasht du mara Khazak.</i>

02:22.608 --> 02:24.407
Predator! Predator city!

02:24.409 --> 02:26.810
Six miles and closing!

02:31.282 --> 02:32.516
Leave it behind! Let's go!

02:32.518 --> 02:33.485
Leaving!

02:49.467 --> 02:52.302
Hurry! Fire up the engines!

02:52.304 --> 02:54.774
Move it, Dietrich!
Fire them up!

02:56.241 --> 02:57.708
Crank all engines.

02:57.710 --> 03:00.577
- Come on! Come on!
- Engine one is down!

03:00.579 --> 03:02.745
Switch to auxiliaries.

03:02.747 --> 03:05.384
Hurry! Hurry!

03:37.915 --> 03:40.650
- Start them up!
- Full throttle!

03:40.652 --> 03:42.852
<i>Yew sahk!</i>

04:11.449 --> 04:13.449
Full power.

04:29.535 --> 04:31.571
London!

04:47.086 --> 04:49.853
Five, six...

04:49.855 --> 04:51.120
Lord Mayor on deck.

04:51.122 --> 04:53.089
- Lord Mayor.
- Mr. Valentine.

04:53.091 --> 04:56.493
- What have we got?
- Small Bavarian mining town,

04:56.495 --> 04:58.627
powered by C-20 land engines.

04:58.629 --> 05:00.529
Usual store of brick,
coal and iron.

05:00.531 --> 05:02.967
And 75 tons of salt.

05:03.999 --> 05:05.569
Barely enough fuel
to last us a week.

05:05.571 --> 05:07.437
We've left the safety
of Britain,

05:07.439 --> 05:09.473
we've crossed the land bridge,
for what?

05:09.475 --> 05:12.743
To feed upon the scraps
of Europe.

05:12.745 --> 05:14.877
- Run it down.
- Aye, aye, sir.

05:37.802 --> 05:39.536
They're gaining on us.

05:39.538 --> 05:41.772
Empty the silos.

05:41.774 --> 05:43.173
All of them.

05:43.175 --> 05:44.173
Do it!

05:44.175 --> 05:45.409
Get down there!

06:17.209 --> 06:19.041
It's madness out there.

06:19.043 --> 06:21.144
You'd think they've never
seen a chase before.

06:21.146 --> 06:23.680
Well, it has been a while, sir.

06:23.682 --> 06:25.548
- Morning, Clytie.
- Morning, Dr. Pomeroy.

06:25.550 --> 06:29.452
The news is not good
from the Hall of Ceramics.

06:29.454 --> 06:31.822
I'm afraid we've suffered
some casualties.

06:31.824 --> 06:33.789
Damn these bloody vibrations.

06:33.791 --> 06:35.492
- Oh.
- Steady on, Arkie.

06:35.494 --> 06:37.827
No, no, no, no,
d-don't worry about me.

06:37.829 --> 06:40.031
We're about to lose
our American deities.

06:43.935 --> 06:46.004
Excuse me, Dr. Pomeroy?

06:47.572 --> 06:49.238
Good morning, Miss Valentine.

06:49.240 --> 06:50.973
I've been waiting outside
the Manuscripts Room

06:50.975 --> 06:52.509
for quite some time.

06:52.511 --> 06:54.243
Your 9:00?

06:54.245 --> 06:56.680
I do apologize.

06:56.682 --> 06:58.848
This is not good enough.

06:58.850 --> 07:00.750
Where the hell is Tom?

07:00.752 --> 07:02.084
- Coming through!
- London! London!

07:02.086 --> 07:03.620
Watch yourself!

07:03.622 --> 07:05.488
- Whoa!
- Watch it!

07:05.490 --> 07:06.555
Whoa!

07:10.696 --> 07:13.096
Sorry. Sorry.

07:13.098 --> 07:15.130
London! London! London!

07:31.016 --> 07:32.885
Give me everything you have.

07:40.658 --> 07:42.659
They're heading
for the foothills.

07:42.661 --> 07:44.793
- Stay on course.
- Sir?

07:44.795 --> 07:46.466
Stay on course.

08:17.663 --> 08:18.997
Take the shot.

08:24.735 --> 08:26.870
Incoming!

08:37.249 --> 08:39.284
Yes! Yes!

08:41.153 --> 08:42.919
Well done, everyone.

08:42.921 --> 08:44.921
- Prepare to ingest.
- Aye, aye, sir.

09:27.932 --> 09:31.200
Ah, Mr. Natsworthy.
Nice of you to join us.

09:31.202 --> 09:33.103
I'm so sorry I'm late, sir.

09:33.105 --> 09:35.037
You look nice.
Have you had a haircut?

09:35.039 --> 09:36.373
- I don't want to hear it, Tom.
- Is that new cologne?

09:36.375 --> 09:38.241
You're already
on your third warning.

09:38.243 --> 09:39.879
This is your last.

09:41.812 --> 09:43.813
Citizens of Salzhaken,

09:43.815 --> 09:45.681
welcome to London.

09:45.683 --> 09:48.718
Bring only your personal
possessions with you.

09:48.720 --> 09:52.855
Old tech is to be deposited
in the bins provided.

09:52.857 --> 09:57.426
Citizens of Salzhaken,
welcome to London.

09:57.428 --> 09:59.094
All right, then. Follow me.

09:59.096 --> 10:01.964
So, you're studying
the end of the Ancients?

10:01.966 --> 10:03.900
What I really need
are firsthand accounts

10:03.902 --> 10:05.267
of the Sixty Minute War.

10:05.269 --> 10:07.970
Journals, books,
personal papers.

10:07.972 --> 10:12.074
Very few written records
survived during that period.

10:12.076 --> 10:13.776
It may very well be they forgot

10:13.778 --> 10:15.145
how to read
and write altogether.

10:15.147 --> 10:18.113
But if it's the
Sixty Minute War you're after,

10:18.115 --> 10:20.251
follow me.

10:21.820 --> 10:23.656
Just give us a minute.

10:25.823 --> 10:30.093
Strange to think
this is what it looked like.

10:30.095 --> 10:32.295
21st century? Yep.

10:32.297 --> 10:34.830
It's so different.

10:34.832 --> 10:36.800
Yeah, well, that's what happens
when the Earth's crust

10:36.802 --> 10:39.004
gets shattered
into a thousand pieces.

10:40.337 --> 10:42.004
Check this out.

10:42.006 --> 10:43.406
- Did you make this?
- Yeah.

10:43.408 --> 10:45.474
Bits of old scrap tech I found.

10:45.476 --> 10:49.344
The power system was a little
bit tricky, but luckily,

10:49.346 --> 10:52.181
I got my man Matthew there
limbered up and ready to go.

10:57.089 --> 10:59.358
This is what I wanted
to show you.

11:05.864 --> 11:07.767
It's a quantum energy weapon.

11:09.267 --> 11:12.068
There were dozens of them
all over the globe.

11:12.070 --> 11:13.435
My God.

11:13.437 --> 11:16.171
They called it Medusa.

11:16.173 --> 11:19.908
How can a society so advanced,
so scientific, be so stupid?

11:19.910 --> 11:21.377
Well, no more stupid
than people today.

11:21.379 --> 11:23.378
They just had far worse weapons

11:23.380 --> 11:27.517
and far more sophisticated
control systems.

11:27.519 --> 11:29.252
What a nightmare.

11:29.254 --> 11:31.387
Well, the Ancients
felt the same way.

11:31.389 --> 11:34.891
That's why they created
this little fella.

11:34.893 --> 11:36.493
A crash drive
to shut down the weapon.

11:36.495 --> 11:38.194
Doesn't this stuff
creep you out?

11:38.196 --> 11:39.963
Let me tell you something.

11:39.965 --> 11:42.165
We come across dangerous tech

11:42.167 --> 11:45.336
that's in way better condition
than this junk all the time.

11:47.239 --> 11:49.973
Now, I've noticed that pieces
have started to go missing.

11:49.975 --> 11:52.307
I notified my boss,
who notified his boss,

11:52.309 --> 11:54.009
and of course nothing happened,

11:54.011 --> 11:58.917
so I decided to take
a few precautions of my own.

12:03.288 --> 12:06.790
All of it is viable
weapons-grade tech.

12:08.259 --> 12:10.993
- God help us.
- The next time we cross

12:10.995 --> 12:13.363
the marshlands, I'm tossing
the entire bloody lot

12:13.365 --> 12:15.565
over the side.

12:15.567 --> 12:17.934
Just let it sink
to the bottom of a swamp

12:17.936 --> 12:19.939
where no one will ever find it.

12:26.211 --> 12:28.811
Miss Valentine. You should have
told me you were coming.

12:28.813 --> 12:30.479
I would have laid
something on for you.

12:30.481 --> 12:33.016
Hello, Herbert.

12:33.018 --> 12:35.118
What are you still
doing here, Natsworthy?

12:35.120 --> 12:36.386
You're on gut duty.

12:36.388 --> 12:38.988
No, I'm assisting
Miss Valentine.

12:38.990 --> 12:40.989
Not anymore.

12:40.991 --> 12:42.858
- You've been demoted.
- What?

12:42.860 --> 12:45.161
- Uh, by who?
- By me.

12:45.163 --> 12:47.897
You're just a skivvy
from the lower tiers

12:47.899 --> 12:50.233
with no family
and no prospects.

12:50.235 --> 12:51.300
If those dim-witted
spanner-heads

12:51.302 --> 12:52.835
beat you to the bins again,

12:52.837 --> 12:54.536
you'll be back
to cleaning the bogs.

12:54.538 --> 12:57.140
Chop-chop.

12:57.142 --> 12:59.209
Well, it's been lovely
chatting.

12:59.211 --> 13:00.779
I have to go.

13:02.313 --> 13:04.817
It's rush hour.
He'll never make it.

13:06.051 --> 13:08.084
Wait! Tom!

13:10.254 --> 13:12.522
Tom, wait!

13:12.524 --> 13:14.858
- I can get you down there.
- You what?

13:14.860 --> 13:16.626
I can get you down there.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.631
Citizens of Salzhaken,

13:21.633 --> 13:23.098
welcome to London.

13:23.100 --> 13:24.633
Bring only your

13:24.635 --> 13:26.603
personal possessions with you.

13:26.605 --> 13:30.276
Old tech is to be deposited
in the bins provided.

13:38.482 --> 13:40.051
- -Uh...

13:41.586 --> 13:43.453
- Okay.
- Hey.

13:43.455 --> 13:45.021
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

13:45.023 --> 13:46.355
I'm with her.

13:46.357 --> 13:47.556
I don't know, I'm with her.

13:47.558 --> 13:49.025
- Come on through.
- Really?

13:49.027 --> 13:50.225
On you go.

13:50.227 --> 13:52.161
Sorry about that.

13:52.163 --> 13:54.030
And that's it? We're through?

13:54.032 --> 13:56.398
Just like that.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.502
Stay in your allocated line.

13:59.504 --> 14:03.672
Possession of any form of
weapon is strictly prohibited.

14:03.674 --> 14:05.507
Hold up, hold up.
What's this, then?

14:05.509 --> 14:06.975
- We'll have that.
- Incomers failing to follow instructions

14:06.977 --> 14:08.413
will be detained.

14:19.190 --> 14:20.956
So, what's the rush?

14:20.958 --> 14:22.959
Well, got to get down there

14:22.961 --> 14:25.427
and go through all the
artifacts taken off the catch.

14:25.429 --> 14:28.031
And anything of historical
importance goes to the museum.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.632
But if I'm late,
the gut workers

14:30.634 --> 14:33.102
shovel everything
into the furnaces.

14:33.104 --> 14:35.474
All they care about
is feeding the beast.

14:41.613 --> 14:43.445
...failing
to follow instructions

14:43.447 --> 14:44.580
- will be detained.
- No, no weapons allowed.

14:44.582 --> 14:47.182
- You cannot treat us like this!
- You stupid? No weapons.

14:47.184 --> 14:49.484
...must be
presented for inspection.

14:49.486 --> 14:51.454
Be aware, children may be

14:51.456 --> 14:54.360
temporarily separated
from parents.

14:57.595 --> 14:59.262
Nether Borough Station.

14:59.264 --> 15:01.631
Disembark here
for Digestion Yards,

15:01.633 --> 15:05.401
Incomer Processing
and Main Engine Rooms.

15:05.403 --> 15:07.103
Mind the drop.

15:07.105 --> 15:08.204
They still haven't caught her?

15:08.206 --> 15:09.638
Who, Anna Fang?

15:09.640 --> 15:11.273
Yeah.

15:11.275 --> 15:13.108
Bloody Anti-Tractionist.

15:13.110 --> 15:15.111
Should be locked up,
in my opinion.

15:15.113 --> 15:16.512
Next one. Move it.

15:16.514 --> 15:19.482
What about you, eh?
What are you hiding?

15:19.484 --> 15:21.050
Yeah, all right. Go through.

15:21.052 --> 15:22.584
Next.

15:22.586 --> 15:24.454
- You there.
- Incomers failing

15:24.456 --> 15:27.522
to follow instructions
will be detained.

15:27.524 --> 15:30.560
All belongings must be
presented for inspection.

15:30.562 --> 15:32.094
We're the enemy.

15:32.096 --> 15:33.463
Anti-Tractionists loathe
everything we stand for.

15:33.465 --> 15:35.198
Yeah, what, like progress?

15:35.200 --> 15:36.132
But it's not progress,
not to them.

15:36.134 --> 15:38.633
To them, our way of life
is unsustainable.

15:38.635 --> 15:40.703
- They see Tractionism as a...
- Oh, oh!

15:40.705 --> 15:42.171
Careful.

15:42.173 --> 15:44.306
Oh, Bevis, mate.

15:44.308 --> 15:46.245
Your tools
are all over the floor.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.479
I'm so sorry.

15:50.481 --> 15:52.547
You all right, Tom?

15:52.549 --> 15:54.349
- On bins again?
- Yeah.

15:54.351 --> 15:57.185
- What are you doing down here?
- Waste chute maintenance.

15:57.187 --> 15:58.653
I got it. Just leave it.

15:58.655 --> 16:00.422
I really am sorry.
I didn't see you.

16:00.424 --> 16:01.392
Why would you?

16:03.660 --> 16:05.627
Bevis, this is Katherine...

16:05.629 --> 16:07.466
Yeah, I know who she is.
Catch you later.

16:11.802 --> 16:14.436
No, no, no, you don't!

16:14.438 --> 16:16.506
Stop! Oh, no, no, no.

16:16.508 --> 16:19.041
Stop! Stop!

16:19.043 --> 16:21.109
That is a Sunbeam TA200.

16:21.111 --> 16:23.546
That's a classic
Radiant Control

16:23.548 --> 16:27.116
double-slice toaster
with automatic bread ejection.

16:27.118 --> 16:29.151
All right? We have to...

16:29.153 --> 16:31.554
And you've lost the knob.

16:31.556 --> 16:34.190
Oh, for Quirke's sake.

16:34.192 --> 16:37.193
Someone knows
their small appliances.

16:37.195 --> 16:38.464
Here.

16:39.596 --> 16:41.263
Very, very nice.

16:41.265 --> 16:43.498
I've dug up a few of these
in my time,

16:43.500 --> 16:45.401
but none as good as this.

16:45.403 --> 16:48.403
Couple of small dents,
a little bit of tarnishing.

16:48.405 --> 16:50.440
Springs gone,
but they always are.

16:50.442 --> 16:52.275
Yeah, well...

16:52.277 --> 16:53.843
That is far better
than anything

16:53.845 --> 16:56.244
in the museum's
current collection.

16:56.246 --> 16:57.680
Well done.

16:57.682 --> 16:59.681
That's high praise
coming from you, sir.

16:59.683 --> 17:02.651
You know, I-I just want to say,
I-I've read all your books.

17:02.653 --> 17:03.853
- Oh, don't encourage him.
- I...

17:03.855 --> 17:05.755
His head's quite big enough.

17:05.757 --> 17:08.458
Hi, Dad.

17:13.765 --> 17:17.333
Kate, what are you doing here?

17:17.335 --> 17:19.501
- I thought you were going to the museum.
- I did.

17:19.502 --> 17:20.671
That's where I bumped into Tom.

17:22.473 --> 17:24.342
Tom.

17:25.509 --> 17:27.175
Tom Natsworthy, isn't it?

17:27.178 --> 17:29.178
Yes, it is.

17:29.180 --> 17:30.813
I knew your parents.

17:30.815 --> 17:32.381
They were lovely people.

17:32.383 --> 17:34.749
- First-class historians, both.
- Excuse me.

17:34.751 --> 17:37.786
I thought you had plans
to be an aviator.

17:37.788 --> 17:41.157
Oh, yeah, I was,
but then I gave it all up.

17:41.159 --> 17:44.693
I mean, history's
more my thing, sir.

17:44.695 --> 17:45.862
I'm surprised they called you

17:45.864 --> 17:47.363
down here
for such a small catch.

17:47.365 --> 17:49.332
Don't underestimate
what's buried

17:49.334 --> 17:50.632
out there in the salt flats.

17:50.634 --> 17:52.535
These... these mining towns
have a way

17:52.537 --> 17:54.373
of digging up
really interesting...

17:55.839 --> 17:57.341
...old tech.

17:58.509 --> 18:01.346
- No way.
- What is that?

18:02.413 --> 18:06.282
That is a fusion inverter cell.

18:06.284 --> 18:08.718
Incredibly rare
and really dangerous.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.353
And you know the Guild of
Engineers nicked all the ones

18:11.355 --> 18:13.655
we had in store at the museum
just a few months ago?

18:13.657 --> 18:15.290
Pomeroy was furious.

18:15.292 --> 18:17.192
Well, they won't get
their hands on this one.

18:17.194 --> 18:19.327
I'll make sure
it's disposed of properly.

18:19.329 --> 18:21.930
Engineers, eh?
They think they run the place.

18:21.932 --> 18:24.400
They don't know
what they're playing with.

18:24.402 --> 18:26.471
- Fire.
- Sorry?

18:27.672 --> 18:30.608
They're playing with fire.

18:33.510 --> 18:35.944
I said get your hands off!

18:35.946 --> 18:37.279
Never!

18:40.617 --> 18:42.450
Oi!

18:42.452 --> 18:43.719
What's going on?

18:45.522 --> 18:47.558
Take this gentleman
to the medics.

18:48.726 --> 18:51.294
I want that man on a charge.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.827
Move it.

18:52.829 --> 18:54.863
That should never have
happened; you all deserve

18:54.865 --> 18:56.766
to be treated
with dignity and respect.

18:56.768 --> 18:58.734
You will be given food,

18:58.736 --> 19:00.902
shelter and employment.

19:00.904 --> 19:02.371
A chance to build a future,

19:02.373 --> 19:04.876
make a new life.

19:08.212 --> 19:10.348
Hey! Watch out!

19:11.915 --> 19:13.652
Valentine.

19:16.421 --> 19:18.921
This is for my mother.

19:21.291 --> 19:23.659
This is for Pandora Shaw.

19:25.296 --> 19:26.265
Dad!

19:33.337 --> 19:34.469
No!

19:50.755 --> 19:52.721
- There!
- Come on.

19:52.723 --> 19:54.824
- Down here!
- Hey, you!

19:56.326 --> 19:57.593
No! Stop her!

19:57.595 --> 20:00.930
Hey, come back here! Stop!

20:00.932 --> 20:02.465
Get out of the way!

20:09.707 --> 20:11.606
Dad!

20:11.608 --> 20:12.644
Stay here.

21:15.906 --> 21:17.707
No! No!

21:17.709 --> 21:19.478
Wait!

21:23.513 --> 21:25.480
Come on!

21:25.482 --> 21:26.917
Come on!

22:08.960 --> 22:11.660
No!

22:11.662 --> 22:13.027
I've got you.

22:13.029 --> 22:15.163
Let go of me!

22:15.165 --> 22:16.832
Tom!

22:16.834 --> 22:18.901
Tom?

22:18.903 --> 22:21.504
Look at me. Look at me.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.975
This is what he does
when you get in his way.

22:25.843 --> 22:27.778
Ask him why
he murdered my mother.

22:29.747 --> 22:31.917
Ask him about Hester Shaw.

22:35.685 --> 22:36.887
No. No!

22:48.633 --> 22:52.037
I-I tried.
I-I tried to stop her.

22:54.471 --> 22:55.805
It's not your fault.

22:55.807 --> 22:57.640
She was saying
the craziest things,

22:57.642 --> 23:00.875
- and then she just...
- What did she say?

23:00.877 --> 23:02.644
- You-you need a doctor.
- No, no.

23:02.646 --> 23:04.750
What did she say, Tom?

23:06.550 --> 23:10.154
She said you murdered
her mother.

23:11.455 --> 23:14.489
Murder?

23:14.491 --> 23:17.459
That's an ugly word.

23:17.461 --> 23:21.029
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

23:21.031 --> 23:23.032
Yeah.

23:23.034 --> 23:26.000
Well, I should go.

23:26.002 --> 23:28.874
Yeah, you should.

23:37.515 --> 23:38.984
Dad!

23:43.587 --> 23:45.787
Dad.

23:45.789 --> 23:48.857
It's all right. It's all right.
I'm okay. I'll be okay.

23:48.859 --> 23:50.494
I'll be okay.

23:52.063 --> 23:55.029
Kate, I'm sorry.
There was nothing I could do.

23:55.031 --> 23:57.065
What do you mean?

23:57.067 --> 23:59.267
They were fighting,
Tom and the girl.

23:59.269 --> 24:01.807
The railing broke.

24:02.940 --> 24:04.543
Coming through!

24:29.733 --> 24:31.933
I'm sorry about Tom.

24:31.935 --> 24:33.704
I really am.

24:35.772 --> 24:38.908
We have airships
out there looking.

24:38.910 --> 24:41.179
If he's alive, we'll find him.

24:44.682 --> 24:46.715
- What is it?
- The girl.

24:46.717 --> 24:48.616
Who was she?

24:48.618 --> 24:50.753
Honestly, I don't know.

24:50.755 --> 24:53.322
Been wondering
about that myself.

24:53.324 --> 24:54.989
She knew you.

24:54.991 --> 24:57.191
I've never seen her
in my life before.

24:57.193 --> 25:00.161
I thought maybe she was
an Anti-Tractionist.

25:00.163 --> 25:02.834
God knows they hate us enough.

25:04.134 --> 25:06.101
I know you want to believe

25:06.103 --> 25:08.202
that Traction Cities
and static settlements

25:08.204 --> 25:11.105
can live together in peace,
but it'll never happen.

25:11.107 --> 25:13.942
- You don't know that.
- Then why do they hide

25:13.944 --> 25:16.210
behind the Shield Wall,
hoarding their resources?

25:16.212 --> 25:19.148
They mean to see us
starve out here, Kate.

25:19.150 --> 25:21.786
Never underestimate
their will to destroy us.

25:23.854 --> 25:26.825
There will never be peace
with Shan Guo.

25:43.273 --> 25:46.243
This is ruined.
I'll get rid of it.

26:41.031 --> 26:42.698
Ow, my head.

26:47.404 --> 26:48.437
What?

27:02.720 --> 27:03.818
Wait.

27:05.189 --> 27:07.125
What's going on?

27:09.059 --> 27:12.061
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on, hang on.

27:12.063 --> 27:14.328
You see, you-you can't
just leave me here.

27:14.330 --> 27:15.998
You shouldn't have followed me.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.365
I didn't follow you.

27:17.367 --> 27:18.769
I fell.

27:20.371 --> 27:22.273
He pushed me.

27:24.208 --> 27:26.141
Hey.

27:26.143 --> 27:27.709
Wait.

27:28.979 --> 27:31.447
Oh, for Quirke's sake.

27:31.449 --> 27:32.917
Oi.

27:34.018 --> 27:35.450
I'm talking to you.

27:35.452 --> 27:37.151
Hello?

27:37.153 --> 27:39.020
What am I supposed to do, eh?

27:39.022 --> 27:40.823
Where am I supposed to go?

27:40.825 --> 27:42.757
- I need to get back on London.
- Six months!

27:42.759 --> 27:45.227
- Just take it easy.
- Six months it took me to get on that city.

27:45.229 --> 27:49.198
I had one shot at Valentine,
and you ruined it.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.803
Okay. All right. All right.

27:57.775 --> 27:58.940
I have money.

27:58.942 --> 28:00.412
No, you don't.

28:04.781 --> 28:06.114
Please.

28:06.116 --> 28:08.116
Please help me get back
on London.

28:08.118 --> 28:11.088
Help me find a trading town.
You'll never see me again.

28:15.425 --> 28:18.160
We're running low
on food, fuel, basic resources.

28:18.162 --> 28:21.162
We can't survive out here
much longer.

28:21.164 --> 28:23.198
We should never have gone
into Europe.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.932
Biggest mistake we ever made.

28:24.934 --> 28:27.201
Well, we have other options.

28:27.203 --> 28:31.405
Ah, yes. Your long-awaited
energy project.

28:31.407 --> 28:33.875
- It'll work.
- I've heard that before.

28:33.877 --> 28:36.245
I just need a little more time.

28:36.247 --> 28:38.146
Always so sure of yourself.

28:38.148 --> 28:42.517
Thaddeus Valentine,
the great archaeologist.

28:42.519 --> 28:44.186
Man of the people.

28:44.188 --> 28:46.455
One of the reasons
I took you in,

28:46.457 --> 28:49.024
why I allowed an outsider
from nowhere

28:49.026 --> 28:51.893
to have power
above his station.

28:51.895 --> 28:55.229
But my patience
is wearing thin.

28:55.231 --> 28:57.431
I raised you up.

28:57.433 --> 29:00.302
I can tear you down.

29:02.839 --> 29:05.106
How can you stand him?

29:05.108 --> 29:07.044
He's afraid.

29:08.945 --> 29:11.479
He's trying to hang on
to a way of life

29:11.481 --> 29:13.148
that doesn't exist anymore.

29:13.150 --> 29:16.117
Municipal Darwinism.

29:16.119 --> 29:18.187
It's a dying system.

29:18.189 --> 29:19.988
Prey has all but gone.

29:19.990 --> 29:21.989
Soon, there'll be nothing left.

29:21.991 --> 29:24.159
I'm trying to build
this city a future,

29:24.161 --> 29:27.895
but Crome's stuck in the past.

29:27.897 --> 29:29.430
Where are you going?

29:29.432 --> 29:31.432
Dad, you can't go to work.

29:31.434 --> 29:33.000
I'm fine, Kate.

29:33.002 --> 29:35.036
You're not fine.
You're injured.

29:35.038 --> 29:36.604
You need to rest.

29:36.606 --> 29:39.607
I've spent 15 years
developing this power system.

29:39.609 --> 29:43.444
I'm not having Magnus Crome
or Hester Shaw stop me now.

29:43.446 --> 29:45.315
Who's Hester Shaw?

29:48.451 --> 29:49.988
No one.

29:51.121 --> 29:53.490
No one you know.

30:02.566 --> 30:04.266
Could you slow down, please?

30:04.268 --> 30:06.267
You want to find
a trading town?

30:06.269 --> 30:08.536
Keep moving.

30:08.538 --> 30:11.006
- My feet hurt.
- Get used to it.

30:11.008 --> 30:12.373
That's what I like about you.

30:12.375 --> 30:14.109
Your boundless sense
of empathy.

30:14.111 --> 30:15.576
- What did you say?
- Nothing. I...

30:15.578 --> 30:17.345
You're right.
Look, I-I talk too much.

30:17.347 --> 30:18.613
Especially when I'm nervous.

30:18.615 --> 30:20.515
But I'm not gonna talk anymore.

30:20.517 --> 30:22.450
Zipped.

30:22.452 --> 30:24.822
No more talking.

30:29.626 --> 30:31.893
Don't worry about me.

30:31.895 --> 30:35.264
I'm more than capable
of looking after myself.

30:35.266 --> 30:38.400
Might surprise you to learn
that I was gonna be an aviator.

30:38.402 --> 30:40.337
I have a faultless sense
of direction.

30:42.940 --> 30:44.605
All right.

30:44.607 --> 30:46.941
Which way?

30:46.943 --> 30:48.977
Oh.

30:48.979 --> 30:53.183
My navigational instincts
tell me...

30:57.186 --> 30:59.520
...we should go...

31:02.992 --> 31:04.325
...that way.

31:04.327 --> 31:06.428
That way, definitely.

31:06.430 --> 31:09.597
Those tracks head south.

31:09.599 --> 31:11.132
Yeah.

31:11.134 --> 31:14.135
You never head south
in the Outlands.

31:14.137 --> 31:15.973
Not ever.

31:38.461 --> 31:40.696
I've reconfigured the metrics.

31:40.698 --> 31:42.497
You can amplify
the magnetic resonance

31:42.499 --> 31:44.699
using materials on hand.

31:44.701 --> 31:48.469
- What else do you need?
- Several more weeks.

31:48.471 --> 31:50.572
Unless you can find me
more old tech.

31:50.574 --> 31:53.741
All the old tech comes to you.

31:53.743 --> 31:57.679
I'll need more than one
to stabilize the isotopes.

31:57.681 --> 31:59.347
Make it work.

31:59.349 --> 32:02.517
I hear you suffered
an injury this morning.

32:02.519 --> 32:06.190
You never told me
Pandora Shaw had a daughter.

32:08.392 --> 32:11.258
She could be a problem.

32:11.260 --> 32:14.629
She won't stop until I'm dead.

32:14.631 --> 32:17.298
Unless you kill her first.

32:17.300 --> 32:22.069
I received a message from
Sharkmoor Prison this morning.

32:22.071 --> 32:25.239
They claim to have captured
a Stalker.

32:25.241 --> 32:28.142
One of the Resurrected.
A bounty killer gone rogue.

32:28.144 --> 32:31.145
Well, it's no use to us.
Too hard to control.

32:31.147 --> 32:33.715
They say it was hunting
something.

32:33.717 --> 32:36.084
Or someone.

32:36.086 --> 32:39.286
It appears the two of you
share a common interest.

32:39.288 --> 32:42.757
This thing is so fixated
on its prey,

32:42.759 --> 32:46.327
all it does is pound the walls
of its cell,

32:46.329 --> 32:48.265
shrieking her name.

32:49.732 --> 32:51.668
Hester Shaw.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.343
- Where to, boss?
- Sharkmoor Prison.

33:07.250 --> 33:08.650
No fires.

33:08.652 --> 33:10.419
Unless you want every Scav town

33:10.421 --> 33:12.687
from here to Rustwater
to find us.

33:18.127 --> 33:20.528
That, uh... that doesn't look
clean enough to wash in.

33:20.530 --> 33:22.363
I-I wouldn't...

33:22.365 --> 33:25.600
Oh, my God, that's disgusting.

33:25.602 --> 33:27.568
Thirst will kill you
before hunger.

33:28.672 --> 33:32.440
It's either this or you can
drink your own urine.

33:32.442 --> 33:34.711
I'll take my chances.

34:03.440 --> 34:07.142
"Best before 2118"?

34:07.144 --> 34:08.641
It's an Inkie.

34:08.643 --> 34:10.811
- It's over a thousand years old.
- Doesn't matter.

34:10.813 --> 34:13.715
The food of the Ancients never
goes off. It's indestructible.

34:35.739 --> 34:38.472
It's so quiet out here.

34:38.474 --> 34:40.474
Doesn't that bother you?

34:40.476 --> 34:42.577
I like the quiet.

34:42.579 --> 34:44.612
I grew up with the sound
of engines.

34:44.614 --> 34:46.347
I've never known anything else.

34:46.349 --> 34:48.583
It's funny, you know.

34:48.585 --> 34:49.918
I've spent my whole life
dreaming

34:49.920 --> 34:51.920
of getting off London,
seeing the world,

34:51.922 --> 34:55.827
and now I'm out here, talking
about drinking my own urine.

34:57.628 --> 34:59.628
Careful what you wish for, eh?

34:59.630 --> 35:01.463
I thought you wanted
to be an aviator.

35:01.465 --> 35:04.302
Oh, I did.
But then my parents died.

35:05.402 --> 35:07.302
Eight years ago now.

35:07.304 --> 35:10.374
When Tier Four collapsed
in the Big Tilt.

35:13.744 --> 35:15.911
Yeah.

35:15.913 --> 35:17.679
What about you?

35:17.681 --> 35:20.414
Well, how old were you
when your mother died?

35:20.416 --> 35:23.784
- We're not gonna do this.
- Do what?

35:23.786 --> 35:25.954
We're not gonna tell each other
our sad stories.

35:25.956 --> 35:27.658
I can't help you.

35:28.759 --> 35:30.695
And you can't help me.

36:04.894 --> 36:06.329
Hello!

36:07.496 --> 36:09.965
Hello! Over here!

36:09.967 --> 36:11.800
- Tom.
- Hey!

36:11.802 --> 36:14.269
- Get down!
- It's a trading town.

36:14.271 --> 36:15.769
Look, look, look, look.

36:15.771 --> 36:17.942
Look.

36:19.842 --> 36:21.508
Oh, God.

36:21.510 --> 36:22.844
They're Southies.

36:30.019 --> 36:31.920
- That was close.
- Too close.

36:31.922 --> 36:33.657
- Get off me.
- Oh.

36:35.891 --> 36:37.227
Run!

36:39.329 --> 36:40.364
Whoa!

36:47.271 --> 36:48.970
What the hell are Southies?

36:48.972 --> 36:50.905
Scavs on a night hunt.

36:50.907 --> 36:52.874
What are they hunting?

36:52.876 --> 36:54.545
Us.

37:35.985 --> 37:37.254
I've got you.

37:38.922 --> 37:40.858
Come on!

37:45.795 --> 37:49.966
Hester? Hester!

38:04.547 --> 38:06.514
Are you in one piece?

38:06.516 --> 38:07.849
Yes.

38:07.851 --> 38:09.918
Oh. Oh!

38:27.838 --> 38:30.804
Couple more seconds, and
you'd have been fender meat.

38:30.806 --> 38:33.541
Lucky for you, we was here.

38:36.380 --> 38:37.748
How bad is it?

39:01.003 --> 39:03.104
She needs a doctor.

39:03.106 --> 39:05.940
No quacks here.
Not on Scuttlebutt.

39:05.942 --> 39:08.108
Could you take us
to the nearest town?

39:08.110 --> 39:09.811
- What?
- Chipping Sodbury.

39:09.813 --> 39:12.112
That'd be the nearest,
wouldn't you say, Mr. Wreyland?

39:12.114 --> 39:14.715
- I would, my love.
- Well, go on, then.

39:14.717 --> 39:18.186
Set a heading north.
We must look after our guests.

39:18.188 --> 39:20.054
Tea?

39:20.056 --> 39:21.755
Don't mind if I do.

39:21.757 --> 39:23.590
I make it myself.

39:23.592 --> 39:24.661
The algae's fresh.

39:27.697 --> 39:29.998
Oh, it's actually not bad.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.865
It's not bad. Bottoms up.

39:31.867 --> 39:33.101
Funny you should say that.

39:33.103 --> 39:35.806
We grow it in the runoff
under the sewage room.

39:38.842 --> 39:43.077
Oh, nasty.
That's gonna leave a scar.

39:43.079 --> 39:45.682
You don't need any more
of those, do you, Petal?

39:53.623 --> 39:56.124
Disembark
here for Digestion Yards,

39:56.126 --> 39:59.026
Incomer Processing
and Main Engine Rooms.

39:59.028 --> 40:02.463
Bevis. Bevis Pod.
I need to speak to you.

40:02.465 --> 40:03.798
- I can't help you.
- Wha...?

40:03.800 --> 40:05.133
The-the girl
that attacked my father...

40:05.135 --> 40:06.767
I don't know what
you're talking about.

40:06.769 --> 40:08.970
What do you mean?
You were there.

40:08.972 --> 40:11.171
You saw what happened.

40:11.173 --> 40:12.240
Nether Borough Station.

40:12.242 --> 40:13.675
Disembark here for

40:13.677 --> 40:15.043
Digestion Yards,
Incomer Processing...

40:15.045 --> 40:16.778
Are you trying
to get me arrested?

40:16.780 --> 40:19.112
The first rule down here is:
"Keep your mouth shut."

40:19.114 --> 40:20.615
My father's in
some kind of trouble.

40:20.617 --> 40:21.983
He's lying to me.
I need to know why.

40:21.985 --> 40:24.519
Your father lies
to a lot of people.

40:24.521 --> 40:26.753
What's that supposed to mean?

40:26.755 --> 40:29.791
Please.
I just want to know the truth.

40:29.793 --> 40:31.693
- No, you don't.
- I promise you. My father's a good man.

40:31.695 --> 40:33.228
- He would never do...
- No, just stop. Stop.

40:33.230 --> 40:34.628
He pushed him.

40:34.630 --> 40:37.167
Your father pushed Tom
off the city.

40:39.835 --> 40:41.168
Why?

40:41.170 --> 40:43.737
Why would he do that to Tom?

40:43.739 --> 40:45.909
Because he got in the way.

40:56.585 --> 40:58.219
It's a lie.

40:58.221 --> 41:00.121
A cover-up.

41:00.123 --> 41:03.494
They're building something
in there.

41:04.894 --> 41:07.161
Something they don't want
anyone to see.

41:07.163 --> 41:09.132
Excuse me, ma'am.

41:11.902 --> 41:13.901
I tried to get inside,

41:13.903 --> 41:16.537
but there are guards
at every entrance.

41:16.539 --> 41:18.541
There's no way in.

41:22.077 --> 41:24.014
What if there was?

41:35.724 --> 41:37.858
<i>Here we are, then.</i>

41:37.860 --> 41:40.327
<i>It's not the Lord Mayor's Suite
at the Boggy Regis,</i>

41:40.329 --> 41:44.097
but it's better than a poke
in the eye with a burnt stick.

41:44.099 --> 41:45.266
Mm.

41:49.972 --> 41:51.905
Make yourselves at home.

41:51.907 --> 41:55.246
I'll be back bright and early
to empty your slops.

41:57.213 --> 41:59.012
- Thank you.
- Not much of a talker, is she?

41:59.014 --> 42:00.815
Your girlfriend.

42:00.817 --> 42:02.282
Oh, no, no, no, no, she's
not... she's not my girlfriend.

42:02.284 --> 42:03.617
Of course not.

42:03.619 --> 42:05.619
Handsome boy like you.

42:05.621 --> 42:07.722
You can do much better.

42:07.724 --> 42:09.990
All right, well, good night,
Mrs. Wreyland.

42:09.992 --> 42:11.858
Oh, dear. There I go
putting me foot in it.

42:11.860 --> 42:14.295
- I didn't mean...
- No, I know what you meant.

42:14.297 --> 42:16.233
Look, you-you take the bed;
I'll take the...

42:18.934 --> 42:21.168
...floor.

42:34.717 --> 42:37.184
This is all my fault.

42:37.186 --> 42:39.989
I'm sorry.

42:43.893 --> 42:46.827
I was eight.

42:46.829 --> 42:50.898
I was eight years old
when my mother died.

42:50.900 --> 42:54.635
She was an archaeologist.

42:54.637 --> 43:00.076
She loved traveling the world
and digging up the past.

43:06.916 --> 43:08.650
They're beautiful.

43:16.393 --> 43:18.659
<i>He used to visit all the time.</i>

43:20.030 --> 43:22.863
<i>He'd spend hours</i>

43:22.865 --> 43:25.900
<i>poring over the things
that she had found.</i>

43:27.871 --> 43:30.003
<i>Then one day...</i>

43:30.005 --> 43:32.141
everything changed.

43:34.043 --> 43:36.043
<i>She'd found something</i>

43:36.045 --> 43:38.445
<i>on one of her digs
in Lost America.</i>

43:38.447 --> 43:39.916
<i>Something he wanted.</i>

43:44.054 --> 43:47.854
- Pandora, what are you doing?
- No. No. No.

43:47.856 --> 43:49.356
What was it?

43:49.358 --> 43:51.458
I don't know.

43:51.460 --> 43:53.327
Stop it! Don't do this!

43:53.329 --> 43:54.394
Let go of me!

43:54.396 --> 43:55.996
- I'm taking it.
- No.

43:59.402 --> 44:02.403
Mom!

44:02.405 --> 44:03.905
Mama.

44:03.907 --> 44:06.110
Hester, take this.

44:07.277 --> 44:08.742
Keep it safe.

44:09.913 --> 44:11.179
<i>Mama!</i>

44:11.181 --> 44:12.847
But he killed her for it.

44:18.221 --> 44:20.320
Mom! Mama!

44:30.500 --> 44:32.001
Run, Hester!

44:36.338 --> 44:37.304
Hester!

44:37.306 --> 44:39.108
<i>He would have killed me, too.</i>

44:50.887 --> 44:52.823
But I got away.

45:08.804 --> 45:11.139
We caught it
on the edge of the marshlands.

45:11.141 --> 45:13.775
- Please stop!
- It had torn apart a whole town.

45:13.777 --> 45:15.776
- Murdered them all.
- Stop it!

45:15.778 --> 45:18.012
I lost a dozen good men
bringing it in.

45:18.014 --> 45:19.947
Hester!

45:19.949 --> 45:22.316
There'd always been rumors
that a few had survived,

45:22.318 --> 45:24.184
the ones that turned rogue
after the Nomad Wars.

45:24.186 --> 45:25.853
Hester!

45:25.855 --> 45:28.155
But I never thought I'd live
to see one in the flesh.

45:29.559 --> 45:32.126
Not that there's much
of that left.

45:32.128 --> 45:35.298
Hester!

45:37.166 --> 45:39.499
Hester!

46:01.324 --> 46:04.260
The last
of the Lazarus Brigade.

46:06.929 --> 46:09.863
Resurrected from
the sleep of death.

46:11.034 --> 46:14.001
I do not sleep.

46:14.003 --> 46:17.240
No, you've been hunting her,
haven't you?

46:19.041 --> 46:21.478
Hunting Hester Shaw.

46:23.012 --> 46:24.545
Why?

46:27.150 --> 46:28.818
Answer me.

46:33.021 --> 46:38.092
She broke her promise.

46:46.469 --> 46:49.570
What happens when you find her?

46:49.572 --> 46:53.074
What happens
when you find Hester Shaw?

46:53.076 --> 46:58.012
I will kill her.

47:07.623 --> 47:10.023
Are you sure about this?

47:10.025 --> 47:12.959
There's no telling
what that thing might do.

47:12.961 --> 47:15.331
I know exactly what it will do.

47:22.605 --> 47:25.072
Hold it steady.

48:21.396 --> 48:23.331
Oh, what-what's wrong?

48:23.333 --> 48:25.099
We've changed direction.
We're heading south.

48:25.101 --> 48:26.336
Get the door.

48:27.704 --> 48:30.104
It's locked.

48:31.139 --> 48:32.408
We're locked in.

48:34.110 --> 48:36.280
Must be something around here.

48:41.451 --> 48:43.153
All right. Maybe.

48:46.755 --> 48:48.190
You have my knife?

49:20.188 --> 49:22.722
If we climb along that ducting,
we can jump from the back.

49:22.724 --> 49:25.126
It's no more than,
like, 20 feet.

49:25.128 --> 49:27.394
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

49:27.396 --> 49:31.065
No, I can't.
I'll-I'll never make the jump.

49:31.067 --> 49:33.670
Uh, you will. I'll help you.

49:37.572 --> 49:39.039
Head due north.

49:39.041 --> 49:40.807
There's a way station
called Ramskate.

49:40.809 --> 49:42.642
You can catch an airfreighter
from there.

49:44.313 --> 49:46.679
- Get him out! Move it!
- Go.

49:46.681 --> 49:48.182
- All right.
- Come on, you lot.

49:48.184 --> 49:49.416
Fine.

49:49.418 --> 49:50.818
Ah, stop your sniveling.

49:54.222 --> 49:55.759
Help!

49:59.362 --> 50:01.064
What are you waiting for? Go.

50:05.233 --> 50:07.133
- Come here.
- No!

50:07.135 --> 50:09.369
- Come here.
- Listen to me.

50:09.371 --> 50:12.338
<i>Hai-ji!</i>

50:12.340 --> 50:13.807
No! No!

50:13.809 --> 50:15.543
<i>Ya ma-tee bihd.</i>

50:15.545 --> 50:17.845
Time to check out, folks.

50:23.351 --> 50:25.452
- Come on, out you come.
- No.

50:25.454 --> 50:26.454
No.

50:26.456 --> 50:28.155
Move it!

50:32.594 --> 50:34.728
- That was your chance.
- Well, I couldn't do it.

50:34.730 --> 50:36.831
I couldn't leave you.

50:36.833 --> 50:40.101
Well, then you're a fool.
I would've left you.

50:47.876 --> 50:49.776
Ladies and gentlemen...

50:49.778 --> 50:51.679
Welcome to Rustwater Market.

50:53.682 --> 50:56.349
This next item
is a vintage piece.

50:57.786 --> 51:00.253
Now, she may look a little
tatty around the edges,

51:00.255 --> 51:02.655
but she's a little ripper.

51:04.327 --> 51:07.494
So, who'll give me 12 quirkes?

51:07.496 --> 51:09.463
Eh?

51:09.465 --> 51:11.632
Oh, come on.

51:11.634 --> 51:15.436
Last chance to secure
this genuine antique.

51:15.438 --> 51:17.838
Ten quirkes,
or I'm chucking her in.

51:17.840 --> 51:19.305
- Two!
- Sold!

51:19.307 --> 51:21.344
Next!

51:27.315 --> 51:30.251
Oh, yeah.

51:30.253 --> 51:31.751
Stone the crows.

51:31.753 --> 51:35.623
Full disclosure to
my valued clients at the back:

51:35.625 --> 51:38.391
This one is a real swamp donkey

51:38.393 --> 51:39.927
and priced accordingly.

51:39.929 --> 51:42.329
Do I have ten quirkes?

51:42.331 --> 51:44.597
- Three.
- Oh, you stingy bastard, De Groot.

51:44.599 --> 51:46.400
You could do better than that.

51:46.402 --> 51:48.635
I'm fully aware
of the exorbitant margins

51:48.637 --> 51:51.771
currently enjoyed
by the sausage-making sector.

51:51.773 --> 51:53.907
Hester!

51:53.909 --> 51:55.342
Five quirkes, and she's yours.

51:55.344 --> 51:56.844
- Four.
- Four quirkes to my left.

51:56.846 --> 51:58.612
- Do I hear five?
- Hester!

51:58.614 --> 51:59.780
Shut up!

51:59.782 --> 52:00.914
Cheer up, love.

52:02.652 --> 52:05.286
You'll look considerably better
as a roll of salami.

52:05.288 --> 52:06.519
Going once.

52:06.521 --> 52:09.222
- Going twice.
- 50!

52:14.597 --> 52:16.530
An unregistered bidder.

52:16.532 --> 52:20.601
Please, approach the stage.

52:40.956 --> 52:43.724
50 quirkes
for this soggy dollop is

52:43.726 --> 52:45.726
an extraordinarily
generous offer, madam.

52:45.728 --> 52:49.229
Normally, that would be enough
to make me self-pollinate.

52:49.231 --> 52:51.898
But my problem is this:

52:51.900 --> 52:55.635
50 quirkes
is not 50,000 quirkes.

52:55.637 --> 52:57.537
Get to the point.

52:57.539 --> 52:59.639
Well, it's quite simple,
really.

52:59.641 --> 53:03.644
There is a bounty
on your head, Miss Fang.

53:03.646 --> 53:06.947
So, either you pay me
50,000 quirkes for the girlie,

53:06.949 --> 53:10.818
or I claim it from the
authorities when I hand you in.

53:10.820 --> 53:12.786
Why don't we settle this...

53:14.257 --> 53:15.192
...with "buy it now."

53:16.891 --> 53:18.592
Hester!

53:18.594 --> 53:19.860
Come!

53:23.965 --> 53:25.365
- Wait!
- Hester!

53:25.367 --> 53:26.900
Hurry!

53:35.577 --> 53:37.280
Anti-Tractionists!

53:42.885 --> 53:44.684
See, I knew
you wouldn't leave me.

53:44.686 --> 53:46.519
Shut up and run.

53:46.521 --> 53:48.889
Anti-Tractionists!

53:48.891 --> 53:51.760
Anti-Tractionists!

53:54.329 --> 53:55.798
Whoa!

53:58.567 --> 54:00.269
This way.

54:03.806 --> 54:04.773
Whoa!

54:33.902 --> 54:36.769
- That's a Resurrected Man.
- Shrike.

54:36.771 --> 54:39.005
His name is Shrike.

54:39.007 --> 54:42.543
You made me a promise,

54:42.545 --> 54:45.646
Hester Shaw.

54:45.648 --> 54:49.717
Now you must keep it.

54:49.719 --> 54:51.552
Go now! Run!

54:51.554 --> 54:52.689
This way!

54:59.427 --> 55:01.431
Come on! Come on!

55:24.652 --> 55:26.954
Hester! Come on.

55:50.646 --> 55:52.515
Where did he go?

55:57.853 --> 55:59.588
Come on. Come on!

56:13.168 --> 56:14.871
Hester!

56:24.746 --> 56:26.014
Get on!

56:28.884 --> 56:31.485
I've got you.

56:35.056 --> 56:36.692
- Wait!
- Leave him.

56:40.496 --> 56:42.061
Tom!

57:06.489 --> 57:08.023
Cut the rope! Do it!

57:16.865 --> 57:17.833
Catch!

58:18.994 --> 58:20.827
Where are you taking us?

58:20.829 --> 58:23.500
Just stay behind me.
I'll handle this.

58:30.139 --> 58:31.106
How?

58:32.574 --> 58:34.206
How exactly will you handle it?

58:34.208 --> 58:36.677
Easy, all right?

58:36.679 --> 58:38.548
Just...

58:46.789 --> 58:48.789
I'm just messing with you.

58:48.791 --> 58:51.961
Sit down. Both of you.

58:58.032 --> 59:00.032
That means you, too, city boy.

59:00.034 --> 59:01.837
Sit.

59:04.139 --> 59:05.742
You're injured.

59:19.021 --> 59:21.722
You saved our lives.

59:21.724 --> 59:23.593
Why?

59:26.695 --> 59:29.164
You don't trust anybody,
do you?

59:30.398 --> 59:32.398
Just like your mother.

59:32.400 --> 59:35.267
You look like her, too.

59:35.269 --> 59:37.336
You knew her?

59:37.338 --> 59:41.374
Pandora Shaw was
the bravest woman I ever met.

59:41.376 --> 59:44.980
After she died,
I looked for you.

59:46.382 --> 59:49.715
I looked for a long time.

59:49.717 --> 59:53.720
Like everybody else,
I thought you were dead.

59:53.722 --> 59:58.992
When I heard you were alive,
made me wonder,

59:58.994 --> 01:00:01.927
how did an eight-year-old girl

01:00:01.929 --> 01:00:05.268
survive all alone
in the Outlands?

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.338
Now I know.

01:00:17.813 --> 01:00:21.682
You were raised by that corpse.

01:00:21.684 --> 01:00:23.717
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Actually, I do.

01:00:23.719 --> 01:00:24.952
- No, you don't.
- I've studied them.

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:27.420
- You've studied them?
- I know a lot about the Resurrected.

01:00:27.422 --> 01:00:28.822
You don't know anything
about him.

01:00:28.824 --> 01:00:31.191
The people who created them
were insane.

01:00:31.193 --> 01:00:33.126
Off-the-charts crazy.
They took all the worst parts

01:00:33.128 --> 01:00:34.094
- of themselves...
- Shut up.

01:00:34.096 --> 01:00:36.796
...all the savagery
and cruelty and hatred,

01:00:36.798 --> 01:00:38.432
and poured it into these
machines, these monsters.

01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:39.766
Shut up!

01:00:39.768 --> 01:00:41.371
He saved my life.

01:00:50.713 --> 01:00:52.445
You're an idiot.

01:01:04.726 --> 01:01:06.492
Mr. Valentine.

01:01:06.494 --> 01:01:09.061
- Not now.
- I'm sure you know who I am.

01:01:09.063 --> 01:01:11.465
- No, I don't.
- Herbert Melliphant.

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:13.467
Your daughter's
a very good friend of mine.

01:01:13.469 --> 01:01:15.936
No, she's not.

01:01:15.938 --> 01:01:18.371
Sir, I have something
that may be of interest to you.

01:01:18.373 --> 01:01:20.307
A cache of old tech.

01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:23.142
High-quality, military-grade.

01:01:23.144 --> 01:01:25.811
I'm overdue a promotion myself.

01:01:25.813 --> 01:01:29.382
I'm thinking a university post
or an honorary degree?

01:01:29.384 --> 01:01:32.052
A position with a title.

01:01:32.054 --> 01:01:36.092
You have a supply of old tech?

01:01:38.827 --> 01:01:40.930
Where is it?

01:02:12.327 --> 01:02:15.465
Shrike saved my life.

01:03:03.878 --> 01:03:06.079
<i>He took me in.</i>

01:03:06.081 --> 01:03:07.517
<i>He looked after me.</i>

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:12.184
<i>In his own way.</i>

01:03:12.186 --> 01:03:14.186
Eat.

01:03:14.188 --> 01:03:18.027
The living must eat.

01:03:25.266 --> 01:03:28.133
<i>He liked to collect things.</i>

01:03:28.135 --> 01:03:29.938
<i>Broken things.</i>

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:35.077
<i>Things that others
had thrown away.</i>

01:03:40.215 --> 01:03:43.249
<i>I think he saw
in those strange machines</i>

01:03:43.251 --> 01:03:46.987
<i>a reflection of himself.</i>

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:49.456
Where is his heart?

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:53.863
It has no heart.

01:03:54.963 --> 01:03:57.333
Like me.

01:04:17.318 --> 01:04:20.220
<i>I think, somewhere deep inside,</i>

01:04:20.222 --> 01:04:23.292
<i>a memory remained.</i>

01:04:26.628 --> 01:04:29.599
<i>A memory from another life.</i>

01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:39.508
I think he had a family once.

01:04:50.585 --> 01:04:53.653
You are sad.

01:04:53.655 --> 01:04:58.995
Always sad, Hester Shaw.

01:05:03.965 --> 01:05:08.471
Your heart is broken.

01:05:10.338 --> 01:05:16.244
I will take away the pain.

01:05:41.402 --> 01:05:46.039
I will remake you,

01:05:46.041 --> 01:05:51.144
as I was remade.

01:05:51.146 --> 01:05:53.512
You're gonna kill me.

01:05:53.514 --> 01:05:57.083
For a little while.

01:05:57.085 --> 01:06:00.086
I made him a promise.

01:06:00.088 --> 01:06:02.655
<i>I would become like him.</i>

01:06:02.657 --> 01:06:05.425
<i>My flesh, steel.</i>

01:06:05.427 --> 01:06:08.728
<i>My nerves, wire.</i>

01:06:08.730 --> 01:06:11.664
<i>My mind wiped clean.</i>

01:06:11.666 --> 01:06:13.800
<i>No thoughts.</i>

01:06:13.802 --> 01:06:16.369
- No!
- <i>No feelings.</i>

01:06:16.371 --> 01:06:19.342
- Mom!
- <i>Nothing.</i>

01:06:20.809 --> 01:06:23.309
I would be free.

01:06:23.311 --> 01:06:26.512
If that's what you wanted,
why did you leave?

01:06:26.514 --> 01:06:31.083
Because six months ago,
London crossed the land bridge,

01:06:31.085 --> 01:06:34.753
and Thaddeus Valentine
came within my reach.

01:06:34.755 --> 01:06:40.695
Hester...!

01:06:50.472 --> 01:06:52.041
That's it.

01:06:53.208 --> 01:06:55.378
That's my sad story.

01:07:14.228 --> 01:07:16.662
Where are we going?

01:07:16.664 --> 01:07:18.697
Have you heard
of the Cat's Cradle?

01:07:18.699 --> 01:07:20.733
The Cat's Cradle?
I thought it was a myth.

01:07:20.735 --> 01:07:22.534
It's not a myth.

01:07:22.536 --> 01:07:25.871
It was built by the Scriven
in the first days of London.

01:07:25.873 --> 01:07:28.173
It's the sort of thing
historians know about

01:07:28.175 --> 01:07:29.675
and everyone else
has forgotten.

01:07:29.677 --> 01:07:31.547
You're too late.

01:07:34.215 --> 01:07:36.349
Dr. Pomeroy?

01:07:36.351 --> 01:07:37.784
They came in this morning,

01:07:37.786 --> 01:07:39.818
a couple of thugs
from the Guild of Engineers.

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:43.155
I tried to stop them.
They knocked me to the ground.

01:07:43.157 --> 01:07:45.226
They knew what
they were looking for.

01:07:46.695 --> 01:07:48.427
They cleaned the place out.

01:07:48.429 --> 01:07:50.465
Took it all to St. Paul's.

01:08:05.646 --> 01:08:09.382
There are over a thousand
stairs in the Cradle.

01:08:09.384 --> 01:08:11.316
Turn upon turn.

01:08:11.318 --> 01:08:14.653
But eventually they lead to
the crypt beneath St. Paul's.

01:08:14.655 --> 01:08:16.622
Be careful, child.

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:18.924
Whatever it is
they are doing in that church

01:08:18.926 --> 01:08:21.393
has nothing to do with God.

01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:47.389
Hold her steady for a second.

01:09:05.538 --> 01:09:07.272
Not bad.

01:09:07.274 --> 01:09:08.875
You've done this before?

01:09:08.877 --> 01:09:11.147
Yeah. A bit.

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:15.881
<i>Good. You can take her in.</i>

01:09:15.884 --> 01:09:18.354
Take her in? Where?

01:09:31.233 --> 01:09:33.232
<i>You are cleared for landing,</i>

01:09:33.234 --> 01:09:35.902
Jenny Haniver. <i>Dock seven.</i>

01:09:35.904 --> 01:09:37.706
<i>Welcome to Airhaven.</i>

01:10:38.365 --> 01:10:39.732
What are they saying?

01:10:39.734 --> 01:10:43.001
Captain Khora was just offering
to buy you dinner.

01:10:43.003 --> 01:10:44.840
Weren't you, Captain?

01:10:46.073 --> 01:10:48.676
Sure. Why not?

01:10:54.082 --> 01:10:56.516
Magnetic resonance is climbing,

01:10:56.518 --> 01:10:57.983
holding at full capacity.

01:11:01.722 --> 01:11:03.723
All systems are active.

01:11:03.725 --> 01:11:06.558
She's ready.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:09.762
It will all be for nothing
unless we act now.

01:11:09.764 --> 01:11:12.701
London must turn east.

01:11:16.904 --> 01:11:19.906
<i>New bearing
confirmed, 90 degrees.</i>

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:21.773
Coordinates set:
51 degrees north

01:11:21.775 --> 01:11:23.843
by 71 degrees east.

01:11:23.845 --> 01:11:26.111
Why are we altering course?

01:11:26.113 --> 01:11:28.815
We're executing
the new order, sir.

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:31.386
Whose order?

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:48.036
Windflower.

01:12:35.015 --> 01:12:36.816
Wh-Wh-Whoa, what's going on?

01:12:36.818 --> 01:12:38.451
They're the Ruh-shan.

01:12:38.453 --> 01:12:40.389
The Anti-Traction League
of Shan Guo.

01:12:41.823 --> 01:12:44.656
This is about my mother,
isn't it?

01:12:44.658 --> 01:12:49.128
Before she died,
Pandora found something.

01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:51.630
Something dangerous.

01:12:51.632 --> 01:12:54.534
She was afraid of Valentine,
of what he might do.

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:56.535
She said, if anything
should happen to her,

01:12:56.537 --> 01:12:58.804
I was to find you.

01:12:58.806 --> 01:13:00.606
That you could stop him.

01:13:00.608 --> 01:13:02.642
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Think.

01:13:02.644 --> 01:13:04.177
Think hard.

01:13:04.179 --> 01:13:05.881
You must remember.

01:13:08.882 --> 01:13:11.150
He took something from her.

01:13:11.152 --> 01:13:13.018
What? What did he take?

01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:15.053
A piece of old tech.

01:13:15.055 --> 01:13:17.790
- What kind of old tech?
- I don't know.

01:13:17.792 --> 01:13:20.460
She was eight years old.
She doesn't remember.

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:22.527
Then perhaps you can help us,
Londoner.

01:13:22.529 --> 01:13:23.929
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:13:23.931 --> 01:13:25.964
Get off me! Get off!

01:13:25.966 --> 01:13:29.404
What are they building
in that cathedral?

01:13:39.948 --> 01:13:41.981
<i>Six months ago,</i>

01:13:41.983 --> 01:13:43.849
Valentine started buying up
fusion inverter cells

01:13:43.851 --> 01:13:45.684
- from Scav traders.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:13:45.686 --> 01:13:47.687
- Fusion inverters?
- You know something?

01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:49.621
No, that's...

01:13:49.623 --> 01:13:50.857
that's impossible.

01:13:50.859 --> 01:13:52.728
He'd have had to have found...

01:14:03.837 --> 01:14:06.104
<i>That piece of old tech
that Valentine took</i>

01:14:06.106 --> 01:14:08.273
from your mother,
did it have a symbol on it?

01:14:08.275 --> 01:14:09.577
Like...

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.216
Like this?

01:14:24.692 --> 01:14:25.892
Yes.

01:14:25.894 --> 01:14:28.093
<i>Your mother found</i>

01:14:28.095 --> 01:14:30.028
a computer core.

01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:33.232
The control system
of a quantum energy weapon.

01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:42.777
Medusa is live.

01:14:44.811 --> 01:14:46.715
Go, go, go.

01:14:48.115 --> 01:14:50.049
- How do we shut it down?
- You don't.

01:14:50.051 --> 01:14:51.884
Well, not without
the crash drive.

01:14:51.886 --> 01:14:55.120
- <i>Anglish, halviti.</i>
- It's a type of key.

01:14:55.122 --> 01:14:57.690
A kill switch that overrides
the firing sequence.

01:14:57.692 --> 01:15:00.092
Once it's initiated, the weapon
would self-destruct.

01:15:00.094 --> 01:15:02.260
This key, does London have it?

01:15:02.262 --> 01:15:03.896
No, it would be
long gone, lost.

01:15:03.898 --> 01:15:05.731
Why should we care
about those barbarians?

01:15:05.733 --> 01:15:07.933
Let Valentine burn
every Traction City

01:15:07.935 --> 01:15:09.936
from here to the Ice Wastes.

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:11.771
He didn't come here
looking for prey.

01:15:11.773 --> 01:15:14.576
Valentine has
another target in mind.

01:15:16.844 --> 01:15:19.648
You dare countermand
an order of Lord Mayor?

01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:28.286
My God.

01:15:30.257 --> 01:15:32.857
Nothing can stand
in the face of this.

01:15:32.859 --> 01:15:34.826
Not the battle hammers
of Arkangel,

01:15:34.828 --> 01:15:37.196
not the howitzers
of Panzerstadt.

01:15:37.198 --> 01:15:40.232
Not even the guns
of the Anti-Tractionists.

01:15:40.234 --> 01:15:44.903
In the great game of survival,
this is checkmate.

01:15:44.905 --> 01:15:47.272
London's heading east.

01:15:47.274 --> 01:15:50.241
They are moving at speed
towards Shan Guo.

01:15:50.243 --> 01:15:53.012
I last saw them
near the Tannhauser Mountains.

01:15:53.014 --> 01:15:54.714
They will have reached
the Eastern Plateau by now.

01:15:54.716 --> 01:15:58.153
- How much time do we have?
- A few hours, at most.

01:15:59.921 --> 01:16:02.187
You mean to go to war?

01:16:02.189 --> 01:16:03.923
You cannot ignore

01:16:03.925 --> 01:16:07.058
the lessons of the past
as if they count for nothing.

01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:10.095
There are no lessons
to be learned from the past.

01:16:10.097 --> 01:16:12.031
History doesn't care.

01:16:12.033 --> 01:16:13.633
It is dead.

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:15.768
This is the future.

01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:19.638
The man who controls this
controls the world.

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:23.110
Is there no end
to your ambition?

01:16:24.878 --> 01:16:28.781
You control nothing.

01:16:28.783 --> 01:16:31.282
Shut this down.

01:16:31.284 --> 01:16:34.186
I want all codes
and operational controls

01:16:34.188 --> 01:16:37.990
handed in to my office
immediately.

01:16:37.992 --> 01:16:40.425
Didn't you hear me?

01:16:40.427 --> 01:16:42.061
I said...

01:16:47.068 --> 01:16:50.268
You cling to the past
as if it can save you.

01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:53.071
You're a relic of a dying age.

01:16:53.073 --> 01:16:55.340
A dinosaur.

01:16:55.342 --> 01:16:58.143
What does that make you?

01:16:58.145 --> 01:17:01.649
Me? I'm the meteor.

01:17:04.918 --> 01:17:06.986
Katherine, come on. Come on.

01:17:08.422 --> 01:17:10.356
No, no. Katherine.

01:17:12.292 --> 01:17:14.228
You can't go back.

01:17:15.328 --> 01:17:17.396
I know he's your father.

01:17:17.398 --> 01:17:19.735
You have to let him go.

01:17:25.273 --> 01:17:27.473
He's not my father.

01:17:27.475 --> 01:17:29.077
Not anymore.

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.820
They're gonna attack
the Shield Wall.

01:17:40.822 --> 01:17:42.388
Get word to Governor Kwan.

01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:44.456
Hey!

01:17:44.458 --> 01:17:46.224
For crying out loud.

01:17:46.226 --> 01:17:48.794
- Hey!
- Check the fuel line!

01:17:48.796 --> 01:17:50.095
Power's out everywhere.

01:17:50.097 --> 01:17:51.796
What is it? What's going on?

01:17:51.798 --> 01:17:53.833
It's a diversion.

01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:55.134
Fire!

01:17:55.136 --> 01:17:56.501
To create chaos.

01:17:56.503 --> 01:17:59.237
Fire!

01:17:59.239 --> 01:18:00.873
What the hell is that?!

01:18:00.875 --> 01:18:02.043
Shrike is here.

01:18:08.181 --> 01:18:11.750
Hester Shaw.

01:18:11.752 --> 01:18:13.218
No!

01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:15.053
- Get back!
- Stop! Don't shoot!

01:18:15.055 --> 01:18:16.488
Shrike, get out!

01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:19.090
No! Stop shooting!

01:18:19.092 --> 01:18:21.192
Anna! Get off!

01:18:21.194 --> 01:18:25.030
Listen to me! Stop! Stop!

01:18:25.032 --> 01:18:27.101
Shrike, no! Anna, no!

01:18:37.878 --> 01:18:39.081
Nils!

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:49.220
- <i>Ka se-wo! Pou ya tek!</i>
- No!

01:18:49.222 --> 01:18:51.257
Listen to me, Shrike!

01:18:57.297 --> 01:18:58.531
<i>Koyo se!</i>

01:19:08.042 --> 01:19:09.508
Get to the <i>Jenny</i> now!

01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:11.480
Go! Go!

01:19:12.913 --> 01:19:15.282
Hester!

01:19:21.823 --> 01:19:23.057
Watch out.

01:19:55.055 --> 01:19:57.488
Nils!

01:19:57.490 --> 01:19:59.558
Get down!

01:20:12.405 --> 01:20:14.173
Everybody, move!

01:20:15.877 --> 01:20:18.277
All aviators, evacuate now!

01:20:18.279 --> 01:20:20.912
I repeat, evacuate now!

01:20:36.564 --> 01:20:37.566
Come on!

01:20:42.235 --> 01:20:44.269
This way!

01:20:55.416 --> 01:20:58.116
Hester.

01:21:09.229 --> 01:21:11.296
No!

01:21:14.435 --> 01:21:16.235
No.

01:21:16.237 --> 01:21:17.535
Tom! No!

01:21:17.537 --> 01:21:18.603
No! Stop!

01:21:18.605 --> 01:21:20.238
Stop, Shrike!

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.641
Stop. You're gonna kill him.

01:21:22.643 --> 01:21:27.579
You will not remember him.

01:21:27.581 --> 01:21:30.415
No. I'm the one.

01:21:30.417 --> 01:21:32.584
I'm the one you came for.

01:21:32.586 --> 01:21:34.152
Let him go.

01:21:34.154 --> 01:21:36.155
Let him live.

01:21:38.192 --> 01:21:43.195
You are crying.

01:21:43.197 --> 01:21:45.397
- He hurt you!
- No.

01:21:45.399 --> 01:21:46.498
He can't die.

01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:48.567
He can't.

01:21:48.569 --> 01:21:50.105
He can't!

01:21:54.742 --> 01:21:56.578
He can't.

01:22:03.650 --> 01:22:05.420
You...

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:08.956
You...

01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:13.461
You love him?

01:22:29.275 --> 01:22:30.545
Shrike?

01:22:36.649 --> 01:22:38.517
No!

01:22:38.519 --> 01:22:40.355
No, Shrike!

01:22:57.104 --> 01:23:00.738
This belongs to you.

01:23:10.818 --> 01:23:14.385
I release you

01:23:14.387 --> 01:23:18.257
from your promise,

01:23:18.259 --> 01:23:23.262
Hester Shaw.

01:23:35.376 --> 01:23:37.345
Shrike.

01:23:44.284 --> 01:23:47.555
Shrike!

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:34.702
Stop it.

01:25:40.868 --> 01:25:42.867
<i>The world is changing.</i>

01:25:42.869 --> 01:25:46.671
London must now look
beyond Municipal Darwinism

01:25:46.673 --> 01:25:49.210
and move into a new age.

01:25:55.882 --> 01:25:58.250
<i>Tonight, we set a course</i>

01:25:58.252 --> 01:25:59.785
<i>for the savage heartland</i>

01:25:59.787 --> 01:26:01.852
of the Anti-Traction League.

01:26:01.854 --> 01:26:06.692
<i>The Shield Wall of Shan Guo
and the lands beyond</i>

01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:08.759
<i>will become our new
hunting ground.</i>

01:26:35.622 --> 01:26:37.888
<i>For centuries, Traction Cities</i>

01:26:37.890 --> 01:26:39.825
<i>have attempted
to breach the wall.</i>

01:26:39.827 --> 01:26:43.829
<i>Their rotting carcasses
lie at its base.</i>

01:26:43.831 --> 01:26:46.865
<i>But that will not be our fate.</i>

01:26:46.867 --> 01:26:49.601
<i>Tonight, London</i>

01:26:49.603 --> 01:26:52.737
is going to demonstrate
its new power,

01:26:52.739 --> 01:26:58.009
<i>a power that will sweep
all before it.</i>

01:26:58.011 --> 01:27:01.545
<i>Tonight, we take the fight</i>

01:27:01.547 --> 01:27:04.318
to Shan Guo.

01:27:16.462 --> 01:27:18.296
Hold your formation

01:27:18.298 --> 01:27:19.801
on approach, <i>Jenny Haniver.</i>

01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:22.768
Welcome home, Windflower.

01:27:22.770 --> 01:27:25.303
Windflower?

01:27:25.305 --> 01:27:29.641
I was once kept as a slave
on the Ice City of Arkangel.

01:27:29.643 --> 01:27:35.080
I vowed never to be owned
by another again.

01:27:35.082 --> 01:27:37.449
I made my friends
swear an oath.

01:27:37.451 --> 01:27:39.985
"When this body is done,

01:27:39.987 --> 01:27:42.920
"throw my ashes to the wind.

01:27:42.922 --> 01:27:47.726
"I can face anything,
even death,

01:27:47.728 --> 01:27:50.461
as long as my spirit is free."

01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:31.836
The Allied Fleet,

01:28:31.838 --> 01:28:34.408
the great defenders
of the East.

01:28:54.595 --> 01:28:56.664
Governor Kwan is waiting.

01:29:08.908 --> 01:29:10.909
London is fast approaching.

01:29:10.911 --> 01:29:13.611
Governor...

01:29:13.613 --> 01:29:15.414
launch the fleet.

01:29:15.416 --> 01:29:17.715
- We cannot wait.
- What are you suggesting?

01:29:17.717 --> 01:29:19.550
A preemptive strike?

01:29:19.552 --> 01:29:21.652
Destroy Medusa
before it destroys us.

01:29:21.654 --> 01:29:22.954
No, no, no.
You-you... you can't do that.

01:29:22.956 --> 01:29:24.955
What choice do we have?

01:29:24.957 --> 01:29:27.793
We didn't start this,
but we will finish it.

01:29:27.795 --> 01:29:29.494
Hang on a minute, all right?

01:29:29.496 --> 01:29:32.062
Listen to me.
There has to be another way.

01:29:32.064 --> 01:29:33.964
There are thousands of
innocent people on that city.

01:29:33.966 --> 01:29:35.933
They don't deserve to die.

01:29:35.935 --> 01:29:38.503
No, they do not.

01:29:38.505 --> 01:29:41.540
Nor do we seek
to harm the innocent.

01:29:41.542 --> 01:29:46.611
Understand, life is precious
to the Shan Guonese.

01:29:46.613 --> 01:29:49.214
So believe me when I say this:

01:29:49.216 --> 01:29:53.985
If there was another way,
I would take it.

01:29:53.987 --> 01:29:56.455
No. It's my home.

01:29:56.457 --> 01:29:58.459
Summon Fleet Command.

01:30:05.032 --> 01:30:08.232
We strike first.

01:30:10.737 --> 01:30:13.071
Tom.

01:30:13.073 --> 01:30:15.507
What's happening?

01:30:21.614 --> 01:30:23.550
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:30:34.494 --> 01:30:35.861
Entering enemy kill zone

01:30:35.863 --> 01:30:38.263
in six minutes and 39 seconds.

01:30:38.265 --> 01:30:39.901
Raise it up.

01:30:48.242 --> 01:30:50.541
We target the searchlights.

01:30:50.543 --> 01:30:51.843
Take out
their forward defenses.

01:30:51.845 --> 01:30:52.977
London's gun turrets
are deadly.

01:30:52.979 --> 01:30:54.545
Don't underestimate them.

01:30:54.547 --> 01:30:56.147
We'll have to destroy

01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:58.916
all fixed artillery
to access the cathedral.

01:30:58.918 --> 01:31:01.956
Take them out.
Hit them hard and fast.

01:31:04.056 --> 01:31:05.991
Get them into the air.

01:31:05.993 --> 01:31:08.826
Now!

01:31:24.176 --> 01:31:26.644
Tom!

01:31:26.646 --> 01:31:29.182
Tom! Wait!

01:31:53.806 --> 01:31:55.307
London!

01:32:15.328 --> 01:32:18.263
What have they done?

01:32:37.317 --> 01:32:41.018
- Confirm target coordinates.
- Coordinates confirmed.

01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:42.956
Target is locked.

01:32:46.025 --> 01:32:48.628
<i>Aso luman sala ta.</i>

01:32:49.762 --> 01:32:52.830
<i>Aso luman sala ta...</i>

01:33:34.908 --> 01:33:36.277
Tom!

01:33:45.152 --> 01:33:48.122
Initiate firing sequence.

01:33:53.159 --> 01:33:54.761
Tom!

01:33:55.962 --> 01:33:57.632
I have it.

01:34:00.199 --> 01:34:02.135
Is that...?

01:34:05.372 --> 01:34:08.305
Where did you get this?

01:34:08.307 --> 01:34:09.676
Go dark.

01:34:14.046 --> 01:34:15.715
They're preparing to fire.

01:34:16.817 --> 01:34:17.982
Sound the alarm.

01:34:17.984 --> 01:34:19.384
Everybody off the wall!

01:34:19.386 --> 01:34:21.085
Run!

01:34:21.087 --> 01:34:23.053
Get inside now!

01:34:25.057 --> 01:34:26.827
We need to find Anna.

01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:34.999
Now, Twix.

01:35:44.003 --> 01:35:46.403
London! London! London!

01:35:46.405 --> 01:35:49.777
London! London! London! London!

01:36:00.086 --> 01:36:03.021
- Hit them again.
- Recharging accumulators.

01:36:03.023 --> 01:36:05.022
They're coming through!

01:36:09.296 --> 01:36:10.231
Anna!

01:36:12.364 --> 01:36:14.331
- We have to get to London!
- Are you crazy?!

01:36:14.333 --> 01:36:16.134
They're gonna fire
that weapon again!

01:36:16.136 --> 01:36:18.468
Not if we shut it down.

01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:21.004
The crash drive.

01:36:21.006 --> 01:36:22.040
My mother gave it to me.

01:36:22.042 --> 01:36:23.141
Come on, we have to go.

01:36:23.143 --> 01:36:24.979
They destroyed
the Allied Fleet.

01:36:27.514 --> 01:36:29.513
They didn't destroy us.

01:36:31.384 --> 01:36:33.317
Nils, you lead.

01:36:33.319 --> 01:36:35.018
Yasmina, stay on his wing.

01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:36.055
Khora.

01:36:40.894 --> 01:36:42.460
We're gonna be
under heavy fire.

01:36:42.462 --> 01:36:45.263
I'll need you
to clear a path for me.

01:36:45.265 --> 01:36:47.401
- Anna.
- Go.

01:36:59.345 --> 01:37:01.079
Where's Tom?

01:37:01.081 --> 01:37:02.283
Tom?

01:37:17.130 --> 01:37:18.932
Tom?

01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:27.272
You sure you want to do this?

01:37:27.274 --> 01:37:30.308
Once we go in,
there's no going back.

01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:31.278
I have to.

01:37:32.444 --> 01:37:34.044
For my mom.

01:37:34.046 --> 01:37:36.282
For Pandora.

01:37:38.018 --> 01:37:39.651
Let's go.

01:38:26.399 --> 01:38:28.132
They're gonna fire again!

01:38:28.134 --> 01:38:30.535
Pull up! Pull up!

01:38:44.317 --> 01:38:46.052
Recharge!

01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:10.273
Khora.

01:39:13.779 --> 01:39:16.080
Khora!

01:39:32.731 --> 01:39:35.299
Stay low, Windflower.

01:39:35.301 --> 01:39:36.800
We'll draw their fire.

01:39:36.802 --> 01:39:38.535
Let's do this!

01:39:38.537 --> 01:39:40.170
<i>Kaza wo bu yagen!</i>

01:40:25.385 --> 01:40:26.587
Anna, leave it to me.

01:40:30.823 --> 01:40:32.725
Nils, watch out!

01:40:36.429 --> 01:40:37.765
Nils! No!

01:40:47.539 --> 01:40:49.777
Toa, cover Yasmina!

01:41:15.167 --> 01:41:16.702
I got this one.

01:41:38.423 --> 01:41:41.194
We're hit, Anna! We're hit!

01:41:47.199 --> 01:41:49.467
Yasmina, take out the last one!

01:41:50.869 --> 01:41:53.207
We're going down! Hang on!

01:42:18.198 --> 01:42:19.362
Toa!

01:42:19.364 --> 01:42:20.498
Toa, come on.

01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:22.299
Come on. Come on, get up.

01:42:23.869 --> 01:42:26.437
Hey, get up.

01:42:26.439 --> 01:42:28.438
Okay.

01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:43.486
Hester!

01:42:43.488 --> 01:42:45.423
Take this,
and stay out of sight

01:42:45.425 --> 01:42:47.525
- until I give you the signal.
- What signal?

01:42:47.527 --> 01:42:50.527
- How will I know?
- Trust me, you'll know.

01:42:50.529 --> 01:42:52.532
I'm not that subtle.

01:43:12.851 --> 01:43:14.852
Warning.

01:43:14.854 --> 01:43:16.687
Core temperature rising.

01:43:16.689 --> 01:43:19.960
Increase the coolant!
Recharge!

01:43:24.663 --> 01:43:25.798
Over there!

01:43:39.712 --> 01:43:41.544
Okay, city boy,
take her from here.

01:43:41.546 --> 01:43:43.680
- What?
- I got to go.

01:43:43.682 --> 01:43:44.818
I'm late for church.

01:43:51.724 --> 01:43:53.523
Hey.

01:43:53.525 --> 01:43:56.329
Look after her.

01:44:07.939 --> 01:44:10.540
Lock target coordinates.

01:44:10.542 --> 01:44:12.442
Target is locked.

01:44:12.444 --> 01:44:14.945
Wait!
Temperatures have to stabilize.

01:44:14.947 --> 01:44:16.313
Prepare to fire.

01:44:16.315 --> 01:44:17.982
Firing sequence initiated.

01:44:17.984 --> 01:44:19.920
Do it, Twix!

01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:25.325
Watch out!

01:44:36.868 --> 01:44:39.070
Warning.

01:44:39.072 --> 01:44:41.871
Core temperature critical.

01:44:41.873 --> 01:44:43.574
Deploy system override.

01:44:43.576 --> 01:44:46.279
Fire again! One more strike,
that wall comes down.

01:44:52.051 --> 01:44:54.785
Take cover!

01:45:05.631 --> 01:45:07.932
System override initiated.

01:45:07.934 --> 01:45:11.701
Firing will commence
in 59 seconds.

01:45:31.591 --> 01:45:33.060
She's gonna blow!

01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:43.804
Firing will commence
in 45 seconds.

01:46:15.935 --> 01:46:18.535
Firing will commence
in 30 seconds.

01:46:18.537 --> 01:46:19.839
Come on, come on.

01:46:36.588 --> 01:46:40.760
Firing will commence
in 15 seconds.

01:46:45.564 --> 01:46:47.798
Ten. Nine.

01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:48.965
- Come on.
- Eight.

01:46:48.967 --> 01:46:51.869
- Come on. Come on, come on.
- Seven. -

01:46:51.871 --> 01:46:53.704
- Six.
- Just let go.

01:46:53.706 --> 01:46:55.906
Five. Four.

01:46:55.908 --> 01:46:57.241
It's over.

01:46:57.243 --> 01:46:59.242
- Three. Two.
- Not yet.

01:46:59.244 --> 01:47:00.611
Come on.

01:47:00.613 --> 01:47:03.046
One.

01:47:07.487 --> 01:47:10.190
Firing sequence terminated.

01:47:19.631 --> 01:47:20.930
Go.

01:47:28.841 --> 01:47:31.075
System overload. Unstable.

01:47:31.077 --> 01:47:32.876
Unstable.

01:47:32.878 --> 01:47:35.047
Now it's over.

01:48:23.296 --> 01:48:24.928
Kate.

01:48:24.930 --> 01:48:26.296
Thank God you're safe.

01:48:26.298 --> 01:48:30.166
- We need to go.
- How could you?

01:48:30.168 --> 01:48:33.571
How many lives have you taken?

01:48:33.573 --> 01:48:35.572
And for what?

01:48:35.574 --> 01:48:38.275
I did what I had to.
This city was dying.

01:48:38.277 --> 01:48:40.777
- I tried to save it.
- Stop lying to me.

01:48:40.779 --> 01:48:43.112
You didn't do this
for any noble cause.

01:48:43.114 --> 01:48:45.348
You did it for yourself,
for the power that it gave you.

01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:46.349
That's not true.

01:48:46.351 --> 01:48:48.352
Kate, we have to go.

01:48:48.354 --> 01:48:49.753
We have to go now.

01:48:49.755 --> 01:48:51.854
Trust me as you once did.

01:48:51.856 --> 01:48:53.691
I can save us both.

01:48:53.693 --> 01:48:56.860
Save us from what?

01:48:56.862 --> 01:49:00.164
The weapon's destroyed.
The wall is still standing.

01:49:00.166 --> 01:49:03.733
- You've failed.
- Failed?

01:49:03.735 --> 01:49:07.006
You really don't know me,
do you?

01:49:09.074 --> 01:49:11.310
That wall is coming down.

01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:18.915
- What have you done?
- Don't go up there.

01:49:18.917 --> 01:49:21.684
Katherine!

01:49:51.050 --> 01:49:53.987
- Let's go, Gench!
- Roger that.

01:50:00.126 --> 01:50:01.360
<i>We must be tethered, boss!</i>

01:50:10.403 --> 01:50:12.135
Come in, London Wheelhouse!

01:50:12.137 --> 01:50:14.237
London Wheelhouse,
do you read me?

01:50:14.239 --> 01:50:16.874
<i>Come in, London Wheelhouse!</i>

01:50:16.876 --> 01:50:18.174
Tom?

01:50:18.176 --> 01:50:20.177
- Tom, is that you?
- Katherine?

01:50:20.179 --> 01:50:22.412
What the hell's going on
down there?

01:50:22.414 --> 01:50:23.914
We're on a collision course.

01:50:23.916 --> 01:50:25.249
He's driving the city
into the wall.

01:50:25.251 --> 01:50:27.284
The brakes are gone.
They're dead.

01:50:27.286 --> 01:50:29.419
You're gonna have to cut
London's engines.

01:50:29.421 --> 01:50:31.955
I can't.
The controls are shot to hell.

01:50:39.832 --> 01:50:41.397
Katherine, I need you
to do something.

01:50:41.399 --> 01:50:42.768
Are you listening?

01:50:51.476 --> 01:50:54.113
You're not going anywhere.

01:50:57.750 --> 01:51:02.255
You're not gonna hurt
anyone else ever again.

01:51:10.296 --> 01:51:12.028
Tom, are you sure about this?

01:51:12.030 --> 01:51:13.699
Do it!

01:51:23.341 --> 01:51:25.909
I will kill you.

01:51:25.911 --> 01:51:28.010
I know you will.

01:51:28.012 --> 01:51:30.414
Whatever the world
throws at you,

01:51:30.416 --> 01:51:33.150
you fight it,
claw your way back.

01:51:33.152 --> 01:51:35.419
You don't give up.

01:51:35.421 --> 01:51:38.224
You are so like me.

01:51:40.391 --> 01:51:43.395
Your mother never told you,
did she?

01:51:47.233 --> 01:51:52.201
But then, I guess she
didn't need to, because...

01:51:52.203 --> 01:51:54.474
you already knew.

01:51:57.376 --> 01:52:00.213
Hester.

01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:10.289
You let your guard down.

01:53:44.382 --> 01:53:47.351
Is this what you want?
You want to die?

01:53:47.353 --> 01:53:49.989
Come on, let's finish it.

01:53:52.091 --> 01:53:53.927
No.

01:54:01.667 --> 01:54:03.837
I'm gonna live.

01:54:13.345 --> 01:54:15.849
Hold on!

01:54:17.382 --> 01:54:19.085
Come on.

01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:26.159
You're history.

01:54:42.006 --> 01:54:43.275
Gench!

01:57:36.314 --> 01:57:38.250
So, what happens now?

01:57:39.717 --> 01:57:43.186
We go where the wind takes us.

01:57:43.188 --> 01:57:44.888
See the world.

01:57:44.890 --> 01:57:47.060
What do you say?

01:57:52.396 --> 01:57:54.367
I'm coming with you.
