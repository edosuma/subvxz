00:16.057 --> 00:18.101


00:22.022 --> 00:25.025
-

00:34.034 --> 00:36.911
Tchau, uggo!

00:39.414 --> 00:42.333
Hm. What do I have in my goodies bag?

00:42.417 --> 00:43.251
Ooh!

00:45.128 --> 00:46.588


00:51.384 --> 00:54.053
Bye! Bye!

01:01.728 --> 01:04.689
We've found
our Incineration Day thief, alright.

01:04.773 --> 01:07.734
Rafaela just deployed
an anti-gravity bomb.

01:07.817 --> 01:10.695
Why was it gonna be destroyed?
Seems like it works great.

01:10.779 --> 01:13.156
She got lucky.
They're usually pretty finicky.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.658
One had me stuck in a tree
for most of last April!

01:15.742 --> 01:17.744
I was like a terrified tabby up there!

01:21.623 --> 01:24.292
Guys, we need to stop Rafaela
before she gets to Berlin

01:24.375 --> 01:26.002
and throws the city into chaos.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.420
We're only 16 kilometers out!

01:27.504 --> 01:31.299
Psh, 16 kilometers?
That's like, 2,000 miles away.

01:31.382 --> 01:33.510
<i> I thought it was</i>
<i>just a couple feet.</i>

01:33.593 --> 01:35.261
<i>Few dozen yards, tops.</i>

01:35.345 --> 01:37.013
Well, I don't see Berlin yet.

01:37.096 --> 01:39.015
<i>Ugh!</i>
<i>It's ten miles, dummies!</i>

01:39.098 --> 01:39.933
<i>Shut her down!</i>

01:40.016 --> 01:42.977
Uncle Tuco's right!
We really do need to go metric!

01:56.241 --> 01:58.368
Oh no, my stalker,

01:58.451 --> 02:00.787
Tony Toretto, found me again!

02:00.870 --> 02:05.458
I gotta give it to him, he's presistant!

02:13.383 --> 02:14.467
Gotcha!

02:21.307 --> 02:23.101
That's the flaming fuel additive.

02:23.184 --> 02:25.770
Rafaela's car will blow up
in about 20 seconds!

02:25.854 --> 02:31.442
Aw! Now we'll never get to see its amazing
contribution to an Incineration Day blaze!

02:32.861 --> 02:35.321
But of course, more pressingly,
a life is in danger.

02:35.905 --> 02:37.365
We wouldn't be in this situation

02:37.448 --> 02:40.702
if the agency hadn't kept a bunch
of dangerous weapons for a whole year.

02:40.785 --> 02:42.579
Seriously, who signed off on this?

02:42.662 --> 02:45.456
As I have stated, that is need-to-know.

02:45.540 --> 02:48.626
At this point, I think we do need to know!

02:52.797 --> 02:53.923
Hot, hot, hot!

02:54.549 --> 02:57.218
Rafaela, your car is going to blow
from the additive!

02:57.302 --> 02:58.595
You have to bail!

02:58.678 --> 03:02.140
Sorry, my mama taught me
not to talk to strangers!

03:02.223 --> 03:04.976
What? You have met me multiple times!

03:11.024 --> 03:14.986
I got to get out of here!
These flashies clashies with my lashies!

03:15.069 --> 03:16.905
Yeah, whatever gets you out of the car.

03:20.992 --> 03:23.578
Mm. Sorry to drop in!

03:26.372 --> 03:27.498
-Ow!

03:27.582 --> 03:28.708
Uh-uh-uh!

03:28.791 --> 03:34.505
-Ow! Hey! Stop! Hey! No! Ow!
-Why. Are. You. So. Love-sessed. With. Me?

03:35.256 --> 03:36.925
For the last time, I'm not!

03:37.008 --> 03:37.842
Hey! Ow!

03:37.926 --> 03:39.719
-Stop! Ow! Stop!
-Why not?!

03:41.346 --> 03:44.307
Oh, no, bro.
What crazy weapon is she using on you?

03:44.390 --> 03:46.809
<i>None of them,</i>
<i>but somehow this is worse!</i>

03:49.562 --> 03:52.607
-Hey! Ow! Stop! Ow!

04:10.250 --> 04:12.543
Yay-yay-yay!

04:12.627 --> 04:16.297
Ugh. I really did not miss
fighting Rafaela.

04:16.381 --> 04:18.341
It's so… loud.

04:18.883 --> 04:21.135
I'm programming my drones
to get that briefcase.

04:25.139 --> 04:27.934
Aw, they're so cute
when they have a mission.

04:33.856 --> 04:35.692
Wait, why are they turning back?

04:35.775 --> 04:38.403
I've got a bad feeling about this!

04:41.864 --> 04:44.867
-They're not cute anymore! Not cute!

04:44.951 --> 04:47.328
Oh, what did she do to them?

04:47.412 --> 04:49.998
<i>She had</i>
<i>the Gremlinizer Virus in that briefcase.</i>

04:54.752 --> 04:58.339
Bad drones! No!
Don't you recognize your Pop-Pop?!

04:59.632 --> 05:00.466
Huh.

05:03.678 --> 05:06.431
Hashtag, upgrade!

05:10.601 --> 05:13.646
-Whoa! What's going on, bro?

05:13.730 --> 05:17.025
I think she's using her magnetized glove
to drag you out by the…

05:17.108 --> 05:19.736
nano drones in your fanny pack!

05:19.819 --> 05:21.904
Ow.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.245
Hand, hand strong,
Frostee, unsafe,

05:29.871 --> 05:33.791
monster, Rafaela, monster, Rafaela!

05:37.587 --> 05:39.839
-Yep, yeah, I'll just go.

05:45.428 --> 05:48.389
-Woo-hoo-hoo!

05:49.640 --> 05:51.017
Ugh, losers incoming.

05:56.981 --> 05:59.442
Enzies, meenzies, minzies, mo!

06:02.862 --> 06:05.323
Of course she had to
hit those two at the same time!

06:07.575 --> 06:08.743
Dude!

06:11.162 --> 06:12.330
Ha!

06:16.000 --> 06:19.170
Remember when we were besties?

06:20.546 --> 06:23.132
You mean
when you brainwashed me?

06:24.217 --> 06:27.261
We shared mascara
and that's for always!

06:27.345 --> 06:29.639
You're my butterfly kiss sis!

06:38.356 --> 06:41.109
-Rafaela, pull over!
-Ew!

06:43.444 --> 06:45.363
-Ha!

06:45.947 --> 06:48.449
-Ghosted you again!

06:53.204 --> 06:55.248
She stole my truck!

06:57.416 --> 06:59.627
We lost her right outside the city limits.

06:59.710 --> 07:02.421
No reports of Rafaela
terrorizing the city yet.

07:02.505 --> 07:03.798
She's gone dark.

07:03.881 --> 07:06.134
I don't understand how
she could have orchestrated

07:06.217 --> 07:09.428
the Incineration Day theft
and the General Dudley mislead

07:09.512 --> 07:10.680
from behind bars.

07:10.763 --> 07:13.349
I don't know,
but there's no underestimating Rafaela.

07:13.432 --> 07:15.810
Remember when
she mind-controlled an entire city?

07:15.893 --> 07:18.479
We had to drink monkey pee 'cause of her.

07:20.064 --> 07:24.026
Plus, her color palette laughs in the face
of the entire fashion industry!

07:24.110 --> 07:25.778
Just because she was locked up

07:25.862 --> 07:28.281
doesn't mean she didn't have
other people helping her.

07:28.364 --> 07:31.576
I have contacts ready to
communicate with me by carrier pigeon

07:31.659 --> 07:32.827
if I'm ever put away!

07:32.910 --> 07:34.203
While we're on that subject,

07:34.287 --> 07:36.789
we may have too many alpha females
in our pigeon flock.

07:36.873 --> 07:40.334
Mm-hm. They are angry
and they are organized.

07:40.418 --> 07:44.213
We'll use this break in the action to
visit the facility Rafaela escaped from.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.757
We need to figure out
how she pulled this off,

07:46.841 --> 07:50.052
and what she has to gain from
grinching up Incineration Day.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.228
Rafaela was a handful.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.731
The guards are eager
to share their stories about her.

08:01.814 --> 08:05.234
Good. We need to hear from
everyone she was in touch with.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.492
-Sorry! It's still catchy!
-Ugh.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.246
Apparently, someone else thought so, too.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.124
Last year, Rafaela got
a letter from a record producer

08:20.208 --> 08:22.585
who found this video
and wanted to sign her…

08:22.668 --> 08:25.338
…but needed samples
of her other musical work.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.518
It was strange.

08:39.393 --> 08:42.647
Rafaela kept writing
letter after letter to the producer,

08:42.730 --> 08:45.024
but none of us ever saw any mail come in.

08:45.107 --> 08:47.485
We assumed she was just losing it.

08:47.568 --> 08:50.488
People deal with
solitary confinement very differently.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.740
Some get lots of letters
but never respond.

08:52.823 --> 08:56.452
Then there was this one lady
who wrote back and forth with herself.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.621
Really? Like, as two different people?

08:58.704 --> 09:00.498
That's exactly right.

09:00.581 --> 09:04.418
One character was from the future,
and the other from the past.

09:04.502 --> 09:09.423
She was released before things
came to a head, but if you ask me,

09:09.507 --> 09:12.218
those star-crossed, time-traveling lovers

09:12.301 --> 09:15.555
were going to meet up
sometime around the Great Depression.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.682
Enough!

09:17.765 --> 09:20.726
Tell us everything you remember
about Rafaela's escape last night!

09:20.810 --> 09:25.106
Right, well, I was standing
outside this very cell

09:25.189 --> 09:27.733
when I heard her voice
coming from down the hall.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.029
Oh, cutie-bo-booty
guard number three!

09:32.113 --> 09:34.490
<i>I had no idea</i>
<i>how she could've gotten out.</i>

09:34.574 --> 09:36.909
This way!

09:39.287 --> 09:41.581
<i>I was shocked</i>
<i>to see her out of her cell,</i>

09:42.164 --> 09:44.667
<i>and even more shocked</i>
<i>to see so many of her!</i>

09:46.711 --> 09:49.088
<i>I was all,</i>
"Ich glaub mein Schwein pfeift!"

10:00.349 --> 10:02.518
Say olá to my holos!

10:04.770 --> 10:09.191
<i>The only thing worse</i>
<i>than Rafaela is multiple Rafaelas!</i>

10:09.775 --> 10:13.070
-<i>Security breach!</i>
-<i>A hologram just called me ugly!</i>

10:13.154 --> 10:16.365
-<i>I need backup!</i>

10:21.203 --> 10:24.540
-Gotcha!

10:25.708 --> 10:27.668
That is the last thing I remember.

10:27.752 --> 10:28.711
When I came to,

10:28.794 --> 10:32.423
Rafaela had already stolen a patrol car
and taken off down the Autobahn.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.968
How did she get the Incineration Day tech
in the first place?

10:36.052 --> 10:39.221
Nobody knows.
There is no footage of it coming in.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.932
Any sign of carrier pigeons?

10:42.016 --> 10:43.809
Uh, no.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.478
Coworkers you don't trust?

10:45.561 --> 10:49.190
If someone had helped her get out,
they would have claimed credit by now.

10:49.273 --> 10:51.525
Everyone wanted to be
the one to get rid of her!

10:51.609 --> 10:54.695
So someone on the outside helped her.
But who?

10:54.779 --> 10:57.073
She was talking to that record label guy.

10:57.156 --> 11:00.201
But it sounds like he might have been
a figment of her imagination.

11:00.284 --> 11:02.370
There's only one theory that fits, bro.

11:03.037 --> 11:06.666
We live on a Möbius strip
that's Rafaela's consciousness!

11:06.749 --> 11:09.627
Oh, my. I hadn't even considered that.

11:09.710 --> 11:12.088
We are her and she is us!

11:14.006 --> 11:18.177
We are caught in her wave,
forever at the whim of an unkind tide!

11:21.597 --> 11:25.226
Or she just mind-controlled
people to help her again.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.853
-Maybe.
-Seems like a stretch.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.648
Nobody we've talked to seems like
they were mind-controlled.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.274
They remember everything clearly.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.111
However it happened, I'm glad she's gone.

11:35.194 --> 11:38.447
She was the most irritating prisoner
we've ever had.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.699
I mean, even the way she says hi is just…

11:41.409 --> 11:43.327
Hi!

11:44.203 --> 11:45.996
I'm pen pals with your bossy-boss,

11:46.080 --> 11:48.499
and he told me to come
as soon as I got out of prison.

11:48.582 --> 11:51.544
One recording contract, please!

11:53.129 --> 11:56.006
Oh, it's actually her.

11:56.090 --> 11:59.176
How is her voice
even more annoying in person?

11:59.260 --> 12:02.596
Pull it up for the fall interns.
They haven't seen it yet!

12:12.273 --> 12:14.984
That is so tragic.

12:27.288 --> 12:31.375
Stupid jel-jel junior execs.
Their boss was totes in love with me.

12:33.461 --> 12:37.756
And those uggos don't know anything
about for-realzies music.

12:40.718 --> 12:43.721
-Ooh!

12:44.930 --> 12:47.975
A new outfit always makes me feel better!

12:50.478 --> 12:52.521
-It's her!

12:53.189 --> 12:57.526
OMG! This outfit is magic-ey!

12:58.569 --> 12:59.778
-Listen up, uggos!

12:59.862 --> 13:02.781
You would have been
super-duper-looper-lucky

13:02.865 --> 13:05.951
to have me as a client,
but you missed your chance!

13:06.035 --> 13:08.412
I have the voice of an angel.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.539
Listen!

13:23.219 --> 13:24.678
So, we have no new leads.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.472
I guess we should head to Berlin

13:26.555 --> 13:29.642
and hope that Rafaela
has uncloaked herself so we can catch her.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.936
Rafaela is doing what downtown?!

13:32.478 --> 13:36.148
She's definitely uncloaked. Let's ride!

13:47.785 --> 13:50.204
Holy cow!

13:54.542 --> 13:56.460
Looks like Rafaela found the power suit.

14:07.429 --> 14:10.015
Aw man,
I hope she didn't use that on my truck!

14:16.647 --> 14:18.566
Rafaela! What's with the new outfit?

14:20.484 --> 14:22.570
Oh good, you're all here!

14:22.653 --> 14:26.991
Now I can use my rejection rage
to get my Raf-venge on you too!

14:27.074 --> 14:29.869
So, this is just a huge temper tantrum?

14:29.952 --> 14:31.203
Looks like it.

14:31.287 --> 14:35.291
How about you take off the suit and
we can talk about everything over food?

14:35.374 --> 14:36.667
Maybe some, uh…

14:36.750 --> 14:39.253
-<i>Kartoffelpuffer!</i>

14:39.336 --> 14:40.212
Kartoffelpuffer?

14:40.296 --> 14:42.172
You're a Kartoffelpuffer!

14:47.553 --> 14:49.096
Thanks a lot, Cisco!

14:49.179 --> 14:53.058
Yo, in my defense, she would have flipped
pretty much anything around on you.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.060
<i>We gotta get that fashion disaster!</i>

14:55.144 --> 14:58.105
What's its weakness? Why did it
end up in the incineration pile?

14:58.188 --> 14:59.648
It looked horrible on me.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.483
If the suit loses enough charge,

15:01.567 --> 15:03.652
the wearer is
completely vulnerable to attack.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.404
Right. Yes, that too.

15:05.487 --> 15:08.657
Hey Frostee, can you figure out
how much charge Rafaela has left?

15:11.410 --> 15:14.246
Looks like she has about
five more power screams to go.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.291
Alright guys. We need to
provoke her into using up those blasts,

15:17.374 --> 15:19.710
but, you know,
make sure you don't actually get hit!

15:19.793 --> 15:21.629
<i>Uh, I don't like this plan!</i>

15:21.712 --> 15:24.506
Sounds pretty fun to me. Yo, Raf!

15:38.395 --> 15:42.066
You messed up my color story!

15:42.149 --> 15:43.567
Pink is the new…

15:43.651 --> 15:46.904
black!

15:47.488 --> 15:48.822
<i>Great job, Echo!</i>

15:48.906 --> 15:51.450
The suit just lost more power! Keep it up!

15:53.494 --> 15:55.329
Power braid!

15:59.792 --> 16:00.834
Link up!

16:22.731 --> 16:23.941
Get out of my way!

16:27.736 --> 16:31.323
I hate everything!

16:32.741 --> 16:34.660
Three more power screams to go!

17:00.060 --> 17:04.148
<i>Rafaela, I am very concerned about</i>
<i>your unhealthy coping mechanisms.</i>

17:04.231 --> 17:07.192
<i>I hope you seek out therapy</i>
<i>at some point in your life.</i>

17:07.276 --> 17:09.862
Don't tell me what to…
do!

17:11.864 --> 17:13.699
She's not ready to put in the work!

17:20.039 --> 17:21.206
Phew!

17:23.042 --> 17:25.794
We just need her to release
two more blasts!

17:25.878 --> 17:26.712
Okay!

17:27.379 --> 17:28.797
So get her attention!

17:28.881 --> 17:30.007
Do I have to?

17:30.090 --> 17:31.175
Yes!

17:38.640 --> 17:40.976
Nobody messes up my hair!

17:51.445 --> 17:54.073
I hope
my truck wasn't parked in there!

17:54.156 --> 17:57.451
Rafaela only has one more scream left
before her suit shuts down.

17:57.534 --> 17:58.952
I got this.

18:11.673 --> 18:12.883
Hey, Rafaela!

18:12.966 --> 18:15.928
I think I know why that record label
didn't want to sign you.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.014
You're not very good!

18:31.819 --> 18:34.279
-Come on, come on!

18:37.032 --> 18:37.866
Gotcha!

18:51.630 --> 18:52.923
Lugnuts.

18:53.006 --> 18:57.136
Rafaela just threw Toretto on top of
a building! Why is the suit still online?!

18:57.219 --> 18:59.388
I don't know.
She's running on fumes!

18:59.471 --> 19:03.684
It's an experimental weapon so
my calculations are also experimental!

19:03.767 --> 19:05.394
Why is there always a sixth rocket?

19:12.234 --> 19:14.236
I've got her in my sights!

19:17.906 --> 19:19.783
I'll keep turning up the heat.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.244
Gary and Julius, pick up Tony. Ha!

19:28.375 --> 19:31.003
Power braid!

19:32.337 --> 19:35.424
-<i>T, are you okay up there?</i>

19:37.384 --> 19:39.845
-Yeah. I think I have an idea.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.097
I've got you now, TT.

19:42.181 --> 19:45.517
Guess you won't be needing
your vroom-vroom anymore!

19:48.604 --> 19:50.355
-Lugnuts again!

19:54.234 --> 19:56.653
Hey, how does your terrible song go again?

19:57.237 --> 20:00.157
It's not terrible!

20:00.240 --> 20:01.200
Prove it!

20:08.665 --> 20:09.541
Um…

20:14.463 --> 20:16.548
Came and got you!

20:28.310 --> 20:29.978
Ha-ha!

20:35.692 --> 20:36.985
We found your truck.

20:37.653 --> 20:41.531
Yeah, but now it has
a Rafaela-sized dent in the hood.

20:43.575 --> 20:44.868
Uh-uh-uh.

20:44.952 --> 20:50.082
You can lock me back up or whatevs,
but I am abso-tootly keeping this outfit.

20:50.165 --> 20:53.669
I don't care about the outfit,
it does nothing for me!

20:53.752 --> 20:56.338
How and why
did you destroy Incineration Day?

20:57.047 --> 20:58.215
Ew. What's that?

20:58.298 --> 21:00.008
Don't play dumb, Rafaela!

21:00.092 --> 21:02.803
You had a briefcase full of stolen tech.
How'd you get it?

21:02.886 --> 21:06.640
I literally just woke up from a beauty nap
one evening and it was there!

21:06.723 --> 21:09.142
So you have no idea where it came from?

21:09.226 --> 21:11.853
No! I just used the gear
to get out of prison

21:11.937 --> 21:14.439
so I could go meet
the record company president!

21:15.399 --> 21:19.278
He told me
he wanted to make me a star!

21:19.361 --> 21:23.198
Well, this star is going to
turn into a supernova,

21:23.282 --> 21:24.950
and then into a neutron star,

21:25.033 --> 21:28.036
and then finally
into a gigantic black hole

21:28.120 --> 21:31.540
that swallows that uggo right up six-ever!

21:34.084 --> 21:36.128
Wow. She really knows her star life cycle.

21:36.211 --> 21:37.045
Mm-hm.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.840
Do you still have
any of those letters you got from him?

21:40.507 --> 21:42.926
-Yes.
-Can we see one?

21:43.510 --> 21:45.595
In there.

21:45.679 --> 21:48.807
They always showed up in my cell
all mysterious-y too.

21:48.890 --> 21:51.101
He made it
supes hard to find the building.

21:51.184 --> 21:53.520
I had to go all over Berlin
looking for it.

21:53.603 --> 21:57.024
Luckily your truck is c-c-c-comfy!

21:57.816 --> 21:59.568
Guys, look at this.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.782
Whoever did this was messing with you.

22:07.826 --> 22:11.246
-Just like they're messing with us.

22:36.354 --> 22:39.107
