# Sarah and Duck. #
QUACK!

00:15.400 --> 00:19.320
This afternoon, Sarah and Duck are
getting ready to watch their

00:19.320 --> 00:22.280
favourite police show on the
computer.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.920
That's a lot of bread biscuits!

00:25.920 --> 00:29.400
Are there any left in the packet?
Uh-huh, lots.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.840
SQUEAKING

00:30.840 --> 00:32.520
Oh! Hello, Bug.

00:49.320 --> 00:52.760
Hang on. Have you washed your hands?

00:52.760 --> 00:54.600
Ugh!
Quack!

01:01.240 --> 01:02.560
WATER RUNS

01:07.040 --> 01:09.200
Quack, quack, quack! Quack!

01:10.920 --> 01:13.320
Ready, Duck?
Quack!

01:14.800 --> 01:17.080
Huh?

01:17.080 --> 01:18.800
Duck...

01:18.800 --> 01:21.440
did you eat the top biscuit?

01:21.440 --> 01:22.480
Quack!

01:23.720 --> 01:24.880
Hmm...

01:27.440 --> 01:29.400
Quack, quack!

01:29.400 --> 01:31.000
Wasn't me!

01:31.000 --> 01:32.600
Hmm.

SIRENS BLARE

01:36.040 --> 01:37.520
Ooh.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.760
What seems to be the problem 'ere,
then?

01:42.760 --> 01:44.960
Oh, thank goodness you're here!

01:44.960 --> 01:49.920
We had lots of drawers,
now we just have lots of holes.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.560
SHE GASPS

01:51.560 --> 01:52.600
Quack!

01:59.120 --> 02:01.640
Sarge!
I think I've found some evidence!

02:01.640 --> 02:03.800
Good work, Constable.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.880
We're on the trail!
SQUEAKING AND GIGGLING

02:07.880 --> 02:09.840
Funny sounding siren...

02:09.840 --> 02:11.200
GIGGLING CONTINUES

02:17.160 --> 02:19.400
Hmm...

02:19.400 --> 02:20.480
No-one there.

02:21.760 --> 02:23.200
SHE GASPS

02:23.200 --> 02:25.480
Where did all the biscuits go?

02:25.480 --> 02:27.200
Don't know.

02:29.600 --> 02:30.640
Ah!

02:30.640 --> 02:32.080
Quack!

02:32.080 --> 02:35.840
Huh. Not here, Duck.
Quack, quack.

02:35.840 --> 02:37.400
QUACK!
Ah!

02:37.400 --> 02:41.320
Good heavens!
The last biscuit has disappeared.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.520
Seems there's
a biscuit burglar on the loose.

02:44.520 --> 02:48.360
Hmm... A biscuit burger.
Quack!

02:48.360 --> 02:53.000
Well, for a crime this serious,
we'd better call the Biscuit Police.

02:54.160 --> 02:55.200
Oh, yeah.

03:06.880 --> 03:10.040
SHE IMITATES SIREN

and...Constable Quack.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.800
Quack, quack!

03:24.800 --> 03:27.560
What's the problem 'ere, then? Uh...

03:27.560 --> 03:31.280
Thank goodness you're here!
All our biscuits have gone.

03:32.240 --> 03:33.320
QUACK!

03:33.320 --> 03:36.040
Ah, clues!

03:36.040 --> 03:37.760
Good work, Constable.

03:42.600 --> 03:45.480
Should you be eating the evidence,
Constable?

03:45.480 --> 03:47.000
Quack!

03:57.760 --> 03:59.560
Bug!

03:59.560 --> 04:01.000
It was you!

04:02.480 --> 04:03.520
Sorry, Bug.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.440
You have to go to jail.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.680
Well, I guess that's case closed.

04:11.680 --> 04:15.840
Uh-huh.
I suppose you both deserve a reward.

04:15.840 --> 04:19.480
There's plenty of biscuits left in
the kitchen. Ooh, yes!

04:19.480 --> 04:21.920
Quack, quack, quack!

04:21.920 --> 04:23.160
BUG SQUEAKS

04:28.800 --> 04:31.960
Huh? There's only one left!

04:31.960 --> 04:33.000
Quack!

04:33.000 --> 04:34.640
You got the wrong bug.

04:35.760 --> 04:40.680
Umbrella? He tickled me to distract
you from the biscuits.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.400
A decoy! Who was it?

04:43.400 --> 04:45.240
I...I don't know.

04:45.240 --> 04:48.000
How can you not know who
tickled you?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.120
I dunno.

04:49.120 --> 04:51.000
I was busy laughing.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.400
Hmm...

04:52.400 --> 04:54.760
What's the plan, Sergeant Sarah?

04:54.760 --> 04:56.160
We wait.

04:56.160 --> 05:00.880
For the Biscuit Burglar. Ah.
A stakeout.

05:09.040 --> 05:11.560
Any sign of our biscuit thief yet?

05:11.560 --> 05:13.400
DUCK SNORES

05:13.400 --> 05:15.080
SARAH GASPS

05:18.400 --> 05:20.880
It was Ant all along!

05:20.880 --> 05:22.520
Wake up, Duck!
Quack!

05:24.480 --> 05:26.520
Quick, he's getting away!

05:26.520 --> 05:27.840
Quick, Duck!

05:27.840 --> 05:30.680
SHE IMITATES SIREN

05:33.680 --> 05:38.520
Look out, a roadblock!
You'll have to proceed on foot.

05:38.520 --> 05:39.960
We're on the trail!

05:44.000 --> 05:45.720
There!

05:47.120 --> 05:48.560
Quickly, Duck!

05:51.120 --> 05:52.520
Whoa.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.040
Biscuit bungalow!

05:54.040 --> 05:55.960
For a biscuit burglar.

05:57.120 --> 06:00.760
Come out, Ant. You're surrounded.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.920
So, Ant. You were the biscuit thief.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.000
ANT CHIRPS

06:05.000 --> 06:06.720
Oh?

06:09.080 --> 06:13.960
My word, there's a flower growing
out of your ant hill!

06:13.960 --> 06:17.280
And it seems to have blocked
the entrance.

06:17.280 --> 06:19.240
Your home was stolen.

06:19.240 --> 06:22.280
So you took the biscuits to
build a new one.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.040
ANT CHIRPS

06:24.040 --> 06:26.360
Flower, you are under arrest.

06:27.440 --> 06:28.520
Quack!

06:30.960 --> 06:32.800
CELL DOOR CLOSING

06:32.800 --> 06:35.960
Who would have thought the real
thief was a flower?

06:37.400 --> 06:39.080
Now, who's for a biscuit?

06:39.080 --> 06:40.440
Quack! Ooh, yes.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.360
Quack, quack, quack!

06:45.440 --> 06:47.280
# Sarah and Duck
QUACK!

06:48.920 --> 06:50.640
# Sarah and Duck
QUACK!

06:52.440 --> 06:54.200
# Sarah and Duck
QUACK!

06:56.360 --> 06:58.240
# Sarah and Duck. #
QUACK!
