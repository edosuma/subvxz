00:04.819 --> 00:06.905
_

00:09.676 --> 00:12.009
Yum!

00:12.095 --> 00:15.012
Breakfast is so the most
important meal of the day.

00:15.064 --> 00:17.579
Especially because we are
getting close to that due date.

00:17.604 --> 00:18.671
Mm-hmm.

00:18.696 --> 00:20.776
Have you been thinking about
what your birth plan is?

00:20.853 --> 00:23.187
Um, to get it out?

00:23.273 --> 00:25.606
No, I mean, like, how you want it to go.

00:25.692 --> 00:29.360
Or who you might, maybe, want
with you in the delivery room.

00:29.412 --> 00:31.946
Well, definitely not the
father, or my boyfriend.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.498
You know, twins can be so competitive.

00:34.534 --> 00:38.836
Right. Well, is there
anyone you would like

00:38.871 --> 00:41.372
to maybe share this experience with?

00:41.424 --> 00:44.775
Nah. I mean, I've gotten
this far by myself.

00:44.927 --> 00:47.853
Plus, I really don't want
anyone looking at my vag.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.884
Ugh, I can't believe
she's shutting us out.

00:53.936 --> 00:56.146
If I can't give birth, I
wanted to at least be there

00:56.171 --> 00:57.783
when our daughter came into this world.

00:57.807 --> 01:00.224
What if when we're driving
Morgan to the hospital,

01:00.310 --> 01:03.121
we just, like, get stuck in traffic

01:03.146 --> 01:05.813
and she just has to have
the baby in the car with us?

01:05.898 --> 01:09.817
Or, maybe, we don't go
to the hospital at all.

01:09.902 --> 01:12.236
My friend, Ruth, had
her baby at her house.

01:12.288 --> 01:13.371
On purpose?

01:13.406 --> 01:14.905
Yeah. Lots of women do it.

01:14.991 --> 01:17.074
And it guarantees that we'll be there.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.043
You don't ask someone
to leave their house

01:19.078 --> 01:21.495
when you're giving birth
in it. That's just tacky.

01:23.234 --> 01:25.997
Eliza, home births sound fascinating.

01:26.022 --> 01:27.385
Tell us about being a midwife.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.670
Uh, well, I like to
consider myself actually

01:29.695 --> 01:31.756
a spirit guide first, midwife second,

01:31.808 --> 01:33.174
and P.E. teacher third.

01:33.199 --> 01:34.759
Isn't that fascinating?

01:34.784 --> 01:36.427
I specialize in water birth.

01:36.479 --> 01:38.262
- It's very tranquil.
- Mm.

01:38.287 --> 01:41.190
I've had many women in
labor experience orgasm.

01:41.934 --> 01:44.101
And one man. That was uncomfortable.

01:44.153 --> 01:45.628
COLLEEN: Ooh, an orgasm.

01:45.653 --> 01:46.915
I'll have what you're gonna be having.

01:46.939 --> 01:48.161
Colleen, stop.

01:48.186 --> 01:51.275
So, do you bring everything
that you need for a water birth?

01:51.361 --> 01:53.027
Like, I don't know, like, tarps?

01:53.052 --> 01:54.445
Oh, yeah, we bring everything.

01:54.497 --> 01:55.442
Everything.

01:55.467 --> 01:57.255
We can even customize the experience.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.761
Oh, we had a mother who
wanted to be surrounded

01:59.786 --> 02:01.585
by her family and friends.

02:01.621 --> 02:04.036
And, to my knowledge, that
had never been done before.

02:04.061 --> 02:05.723
Doesn't that sound super extra fun?

02:05.748 --> 02:07.512
Okay, you know what,
I'm just thinking here,

02:07.537 --> 02:09.513
but I think you should
come in and see one.

02:09.865 --> 02:11.031
What?

02:12.465 --> 02:14.513
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

02:15.497 --> 02:17.268
IMOGEN: Mm-hmm.

02:17.303 --> 02:18.803
BOTH: Welcome.

02:18.888 --> 02:20.304
Welcome to our home.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.368
You'll notice that even
though she's in active labor,

02:22.392 --> 02:25.138
Sasha is in a very serene place, right?

02:25.163 --> 02:26.622
And please, if you
feel the need to chant

02:26.646 --> 02:29.059
or hum or sing, don't
deny yourself that, huh?

02:29.084 --> 02:30.398
(EXHALES)

02:30.483 --> 02:32.700
Traffic on the way over
here was really crazy.

02:32.785 --> 02:34.151
I'm sorry, I'm so uncomfortable.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.850
I don't know what to say right
now. Oh, are those cold cuts?

02:36.875 --> 02:38.592
(SASHA MOANING)

02:38.617 --> 02:39.950
Mm-hmm...

02:39.975 --> 02:42.951
Oh, I think we're getting close.
I'm gonna do one last check.

02:42.976 --> 02:44.795
- Ooh. (EXHALES)
- Okay.

02:44.831 --> 02:48.165
Okay. Sasha, please welcome me in.

02:48.217 --> 02:49.583
I need verbal consent.

02:49.608 --> 02:51.635
- You may enter.
- Okay, great.

02:52.492 --> 02:54.588
- Oh.
- Oh.

02:54.674 --> 02:55.985
Oh. Forgot a napkin.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.306
Okay, Team Miracle, it's
time to get in that pool

02:58.331 --> 02:59.810
as one and leave as two.

02:59.846 --> 03:02.146
Okay, right now, tranquility
is really our friend.

03:02.181 --> 03:03.370
- Are we calm? Great.
- Yeah.

03:03.395 --> 03:05.099
Okay, great, let's do it.

03:05.541 --> 03:07.729
- Okay.
- This is actually kind of cool.

03:07.754 --> 03:09.520
- Yay. (LAUGHS)
- (LAUGHS)

03:09.545 --> 03:12.523
Who knew having a
baby could be so chill?

03:12.608 --> 03:15.634
(SCREAMING): No!

03:15.659 --> 03:16.861
No!

03:16.913 --> 03:19.006
Colleen, you said this
would be super extra fun.

03:19.031 --> 03:21.048
Well, it is! I mean,
she just said, "Woo-hoo!"

03:21.073 --> 03:23.451
Like, is she in labor or
is she on spring break?

03:23.536 --> 03:24.536
SASHA: Oh, the pain.

03:24.620 --> 03:27.030
- Matt, you're missing it.
- Nah, I'm good.

03:27.055 --> 03:28.873
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

03:28.925 --> 03:32.209
Oh, my God! The pain! It's so bad.

03:32.234 --> 03:34.345
He's coming out teeth first!

03:34.380 --> 03:36.074
She's actually gonna die.
If I was her, I wouldn't...

03:36.098 --> 03:37.266
I would want to die right now.

03:37.290 --> 03:38.258
She does not want to die.

03:38.283 --> 03:39.648
Please kill me.

03:40.269 --> 03:41.685
That's the orgasm.

03:41.985 --> 03:44.555
I can't do this. I can't do this.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.891
SASHA: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

03:46.943 --> 03:47.942
- Get it out.
- Okay,

03:47.967 --> 03:49.371
- Imogen, your queen is crowning.
- Oh, God.

03:49.395 --> 03:53.066
There we go. Matt, Matt. Grab
a leg, okay? Get in the tub.

03:53.091 --> 03:55.649
- Okay.
- Oh, sweet Lord.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.487
SASHA: Oh, my God!

03:59.650 --> 04:01.355
(MATT SCREAMS)

04:01.851 --> 04:03.233
- SASHA: Oh, God.
- (EXHALES)

04:03.258 --> 04:06.076
Man, that lady is in so much pain.

04:06.128 --> 04:07.661
I think that was Matt.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.415
I'm so sorry I made you watch that.

04:12.265 --> 04:14.208
I don't know if I can do this.

04:14.694 --> 04:17.168
It's okay. If you want to have the baby

04:17.194 --> 04:19.334
in the hospital with drugs, by yourself,

04:19.358 --> 04:21.526
I totally support you.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.345
No, I mean...

04:24.967 --> 04:27.398
I just don't know if
I can do this at all.

04:27.433 --> 04:29.099
What? Of course you can.

04:29.512 --> 04:32.096
- Y-You're stronger than you think.
- (SIGHS)

04:32.121 --> 04:35.523
Like you said, you've
come this far on your own.

04:36.106 --> 04:38.660
But what if I don't
want to do it on my own?

04:40.201 --> 04:42.011
Would you and Matt...

04:42.365 --> 04:44.884
please, maybe, just,
would you be there with me?

04:45.835 --> 04:47.282
Really?

04:47.670 --> 04:48.670
I would love that.

04:48.704 --> 04:50.626
We would love that.

04:51.118 --> 04:53.017
Thank you.

04:55.567 --> 04:57.405
I swallowed some of that water.

05:00.317 --> 05:02.109
_

05:02.134 --> 05:03.412
JENNA (IN DISTANCE): Most
people appreciate them.

05:03.436 --> 05:04.446
SAMANTHA: Well, I'm not most people!

05:04.470 --> 05:05.948
JENNA: Yes, you are. You are so basic.

05:05.972 --> 05:09.481
Oh, Sam and her friend
Jenna are really going at it.

05:09.634 --> 05:11.794
- SAMANTHA: Get out!
- (WHISPERS): Ooh. Here they come.

05:12.882 --> 05:15.390
Sam's acting insane.

05:15.898 --> 05:18.732
No offense. I realize
mental illness is genetic.

05:18.818 --> 05:21.652
(CLEARS THROAT) Okay, so I guess
you won't be staying for dinner.

05:21.737 --> 05:22.820
(SIGHS): No.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.655
I'll just take mine to go.

05:30.906 --> 05:31.989
(DOOR CLOSES)

05:33.380 --> 05:34.465
Is she gone?

05:34.500 --> 05:38.085
She's outside eating her
dinner like a raccoon.

05:38.110 --> 05:39.336
Jenna's dead to me.

05:39.388 --> 05:41.422
Oh, honey, what was the fight about?

05:41.507 --> 05:44.091
No, Mom, I think we
should stay out of it.

05:44.116 --> 05:45.963
She was using my Insta to catfish boys

05:45.988 --> 05:48.649
into sending her pics
of their treasure trails.

05:48.674 --> 05:51.849
What's Insta? What's catfish?
What's treasure trails?

05:51.874 --> 05:53.890
There's no way I'm
spending my whole summer

05:53.915 --> 05:55.319
working at the pool with her again.

05:55.354 --> 05:58.437
Well, I think you're making
a very grown-up decision.

05:58.462 --> 06:02.776
God, Mom, not everything's
fodder for comment. (SIGHS)

06:02.970 --> 06:05.863
Honey, maybe you can help them make up.

06:05.915 --> 06:10.475
No. When the moms get involved,
the daughters get pissed.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.286
Well, I don't know if that's true.

06:12.371 --> 06:14.505
You know, maybe you
don't have to comment

06:14.540 --> 06:16.840
on every single thing that I say.

06:20.917 --> 06:22.796
Oh, finally.

06:23.433 --> 06:24.728
No more Jenna.

06:24.753 --> 06:27.551
Sam is not gonna be held
back by that deadweight loser.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.054
I thought we were gonna talk
about our daughter's problems

06:30.106 --> 06:32.082
after we fooled around.

06:32.613 --> 06:33.857
We already did.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.074
That was it? I still
have my underwear on.

06:36.099 --> 06:40.002
Yeah. That was it. Anyway, now
Sam has her summer available,

06:40.027 --> 06:42.096
and she can do that
internship at the art gallery.

06:42.121 --> 06:44.063
Oh, I am so happy, I could do it again.

06:44.407 --> 06:45.899
Do what again?

06:47.243 --> 06:50.491
Honey, it's so good of you to
drive me to physical therapy.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.159
- (PASSING HORN HONKS)
- Oh!

06:52.235 --> 06:53.318
- (PHONE CHIMING)
- Oh.

06:53.343 --> 06:54.412
Oh, no, I've got it!

06:54.463 --> 06:55.579
I've got it. Here we go.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.953
Okay. Um...

06:57.978 --> 07:00.217
someone named "Mega-Bitch"

07:00.252 --> 07:02.336
has texted you five times.

07:02.421 --> 07:05.134
That's Jenna. You can delete them.

07:05.159 --> 07:07.790
Oh, no, no, no, I would never.

07:07.884 --> 07:10.010
Because I don't know how.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.942
I had a mega-bitch in my life once.

07:12.967 --> 07:15.794
Marion. She was a dear friend,

07:15.819 --> 07:17.752
but we had a falling out.

07:17.820 --> 07:19.853
A-About what?

07:19.878 --> 07:21.605
She copied my kitchen tiles,

07:21.630 --> 07:23.630
so I stopped speaking to her forever.

07:24.465 --> 07:26.076
Over kitchen tiles?

07:26.690 --> 07:28.825
It just isn't done.

07:30.255 --> 07:32.477
But you'd be surprised
how quickly a friend

07:32.501 --> 07:36.438
can go from being dead
to you to just being dead.

07:36.571 --> 07:39.907
I-I know because Marion's now dead.

07:40.579 --> 07:41.436
Wow.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.094
That's actually really sad.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.096
Yeah, yeah.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.798
I mean, I-I won't go into details,

07:47.883 --> 07:50.217
but imagine the worst thing

07:50.302 --> 07:53.103
that can happen to you in a garden.

07:55.349 --> 07:56.815
He's so hot.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.240
- Oh, I know.
- (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)

07:58.264 --> 08:00.310
Oh, I can't wait for
us to work at the pool.

08:00.396 --> 08:03.229
They told me we can refill
the condiments this year.

08:03.254 --> 08:06.370
Remember when we got
so random with mustard?

08:06.395 --> 08:07.972
JENNA: That was insane of us.

08:07.997 --> 08:09.953
Oh, and I bought a waterproof camera

08:09.989 --> 08:11.989
so we can take pictures
of all the hot guys.

08:12.014 --> 08:15.510
- Ugh, I wish boys were wet all the time.
- HEATHER: Jenna.

08:15.535 --> 08:17.848
It's just, well, so good to see you.

08:17.873 --> 08:19.496
Sam, could we talk for a second?

08:21.481 --> 08:23.206
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:23.231 --> 08:25.065
I thought that you and Jenna were done.

08:25.090 --> 08:28.839
We were, but then Mom-Mom told
me about her super dead friend

08:28.924 --> 08:31.141
and it made me realize
Jenna could be stabbed

08:31.177 --> 08:34.010
by a deranged drifter in
her garden at any time.

08:36.711 --> 08:38.515
- (TANK GROWLING)
- Oh.

08:38.562 --> 08:41.235
- (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)
- Tank. Drop it!

08:41.320 --> 08:42.352
HEATHER: Mom?

08:42.438 --> 08:46.190
Mom, I told you not to
meddle in Sam's life.

08:46.242 --> 08:48.992
Oh, I know you were worried
she wouldn't listen to me,

08:49.028 --> 08:50.722
but she was very receptive.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.330
No, no, it's not that.

08:52.355 --> 08:56.058
It's just that Jenna is a
terrible influence on her.

08:56.097 --> 08:58.566
And she has wasted every
summer with that dud.

08:58.591 --> 09:00.204
Then they finally have a falling-out,

09:00.289 --> 09:03.207
you come in with your
"dead Marion" sob story,

09:03.259 --> 09:04.842
and you-you ruin everything.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.251
Well, Marion was a
true and a dear friend.

09:07.276 --> 09:09.191
Oh, Mom, come on. She
stole your kitchen tile.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.632
Okay, I have heard
you say multiple times

09:11.717 --> 09:13.386
you're glad she's dead.

09:13.902 --> 09:15.643
It just isn't done.

09:15.668 --> 09:17.721
Honey, why don't you
tell Sam how you feel

09:17.807 --> 09:19.371
about her friend?

09:19.722 --> 09:21.809
I didn't listen to you when I was a kid,

09:21.894 --> 09:23.644
and Sam is not gonna listen to me.

09:23.669 --> 09:26.336
Sam isn't you, Heather.

09:26.448 --> 09:28.532
She'll care about what you say.

09:29.952 --> 09:30.901
What do you know?

09:30.953 --> 09:32.974
You think your eye cream is working.

09:32.999 --> 09:34.738
Oh, you know what?

09:34.763 --> 09:37.909
- Don't waste your summer with Jenna.
- (SCOFFS)

09:37.934 --> 09:40.544
Find an internship somewhere.

09:40.579 --> 09:42.246
Find your passion, I just...

09:42.271 --> 09:44.081
I don't want you to
lose out on your dreams

09:44.166 --> 09:46.083
because your best
friend doesn't have any.

09:46.108 --> 09:47.062
You don't get it.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.417
- Your best friend is Dad.
- Oh...

09:48.441 --> 09:50.574
- Oh, and Sophia!
- (SCOFFS)

09:50.775 --> 09:53.297
Do you think that I don't
know what it's like to be you?

09:53.322 --> 09:54.461
Hey.

09:54.486 --> 09:56.226
I was you, okay?

09:56.262 --> 09:58.512
You don't think that I liked wet boys

09:58.537 --> 09:59.847
- when I was your age?
- Oh, God.

09:59.872 --> 10:01.598
- Mom, stop!
- Huh? Hey! Hey!

10:01.684 --> 10:05.936
- I invented liking wet boys!
- (DOOR SLAMS)

10:07.606 --> 10:09.523
And then she made me realize

10:09.608 --> 10:11.692
that my skin care routine was failing.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.777
I told you that this would happen.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.112
I felt sure she would listen to you.

10:16.820 --> 10:18.425
(DOOR OPENS)

10:19.430 --> 10:21.130
Here we go.

10:23.234 --> 10:25.818
I need you to sign this.

10:26.451 --> 10:27.708
Well, what is it?

10:27.793 --> 10:30.670
It's an application for
that art gallery internship.

10:30.905 --> 10:31.929
Jenna's probably going

10:31.964 --> 10:33.714
to get fired from the pool, anyway.

10:33.799 --> 10:36.133
She told me that she was
going to tongue the guys

10:36.218 --> 10:37.585
when she gives them CPR.

10:41.311 --> 10:43.307
She listened.

10:43.392 --> 10:46.610
- I guess she does care what you think.
- (SIGHS)

10:46.645 --> 10:50.731
And now, instead of
Jenna bringing Sam down,

10:50.816 --> 10:53.483
maybe Sam can pull Jenna up.

10:53.933 --> 10:56.351
Or maybe Jenna will die in a garden.

10:59.424 --> 11:01.346

11:01.786 --> 11:03.202
(PHONE CHIMES)

11:03.255 --> 11:05.275
(GASPS) Ooh, yeah, Greg.

11:05.300 --> 11:06.533
- Mommy likey.
- Ooh.

11:06.558 --> 11:08.933
A midday sext. Jen, you nasty.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.813
- (CHUCKLES)
- Oh, no, no. It's a credit card alert.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.637
Oh, then you just weird.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.639
Yeah. Greg just dropped
some serious coin

11:14.674 --> 11:18.273
at this store I love. Ooh,
I bet it's my push present.

11:18.298 --> 11:20.632
Wait, isn't your present the baby?

11:20.657 --> 11:22.574
No, no. It's something fancy you wear

11:22.599 --> 11:24.215
that reminds you of the baby.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.778
Oh. Well, what if you have a C-section?

11:25.802 --> 11:27.302
Then you wouldn't get a push present.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.721
Colleen, please. He already
bought it, and I'm getting it.

11:33.836 --> 11:35.083
Hey, you.

11:37.075 --> 11:38.387
Hey.

11:40.984 --> 11:43.484
You know, I'm-I'm not
sure what this smile is,

11:43.570 --> 11:45.170
but it sure beats you just staring at me

11:45.238 --> 11:48.906
until I apologize for
something I didn't know I did.

11:48.959 --> 11:50.925
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, that's
a different stare.

11:50.950 --> 11:52.066
This...

11:52.862 --> 11:54.463
is a love stare.

11:57.265 --> 11:58.681
Yeah.

11:58.969 --> 12:02.337
And I-I think I see the difference.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.768
Okay. Um, I'm gonna go.

12:08.803 --> 12:10.887
- Okay. (CHUCKLES)
- Yeah.

12:10.912 --> 12:12.580
I'm gonna watch you go.

12:18.229 --> 12:21.981
Hi. Thank you so much
for babysitting Lark.

12:22.067 --> 12:25.083
Mm! No trouble. No.

12:25.108 --> 12:26.652
Done with the windows.

12:26.738 --> 12:29.155
- (GASPS)
- W-Was she cleaning your windows?

12:29.240 --> 12:30.656
Oh, she's play cleaning.

12:30.742 --> 12:33.241
Yeah, you did such a good
job on the windows, Lark.

12:33.266 --> 12:34.682
Do you want to try the toilets?

12:34.707 --> 12:35.628
Yes.

12:35.653 --> 12:38.275
Yeah, don't forget your scrubby puppet.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.050
Oh, she's having so much fun.

12:40.523 --> 12:41.709
Oh, hey.

12:41.734 --> 12:42.835
This is nice.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.345
Yeah, I was gonna say
that you're glowing,

12:44.369 --> 12:47.047
- but I think it's just the jacket.
- Thank you.

12:47.072 --> 12:48.341
It's my push present from Greg.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.984
I mean, he didn't give
it to me, but I found it,

12:51.009 --> 12:53.702
and I couldn't resist sneaking
it out for a test drive.

12:53.727 --> 12:56.491
(GASPS) I wish I had one of these.

12:56.516 --> 12:58.640
Yeah, the only jacket
that Tim's ever given me

12:58.665 --> 13:00.520
is a Flonase-branded windbreaker.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.522
Oh. Well, you should get one.

13:02.574 --> 13:03.823
- No, really?
- Yeah.

13:03.858 --> 13:06.151
- Oh, God, well, then we'd be like twins.
- Yeah.

13:06.176 --> 13:07.261
- Yeah. I mean, you know...
- Yeah.

13:07.285 --> 13:08.698
the kind of twins that would make sure

13:08.722 --> 13:09.941
not to wear it on the same day.

13:09.965 --> 13:13.376
(LAUGHS): Oh, well,
that would be ridiculous.

13:13.401 --> 13:15.759
Or it would bond us like sisters

13:15.784 --> 13:17.370
in a way that I've always wanted.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.505
- Yeah.
- You're right. It would be ridiculous.

13:19.541 --> 13:21.707
- (TOILET FLUSHES)
- (LAUGHS) Lark!

13:22.328 --> 13:24.877
- (DOOR OPENS)
- Hey.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.630
Thanks for watching Lark again.
I don't know what Jen said

13:27.715 --> 13:30.535
to our babysitter, but she's
not returning our calls anymore.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.976
(LAUGHS): Oh, no way.

13:32.001 --> 13:34.556
I bought Mom that same
jacket for her birthday.

13:35.478 --> 13:38.478
You-you bought Mom a jacket like this

13:38.503 --> 13:40.086
for her birthday? Not Jen?

13:40.111 --> 13:42.035
Why would you think I
bought that jacket for Jen?

13:42.060 --> 13:45.049
Because Jen thinks that you
bought that jacket for Jen.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.427
She knows about it, Greg.

13:46.452 --> 13:47.711
She thinks that's her push present.

13:47.735 --> 13:49.803
Push present? Why would
she get a push present?

13:49.828 --> 13:51.378
It's our second kid.

13:51.403 --> 13:53.155
What do you think? That
you push on the first one

13:53.179 --> 13:55.232
and the rest just fall out?

13:55.257 --> 13:57.171
Yeah, good point. I got to fix this.

13:57.196 --> 14:00.447
(VACUUM WHIRRING)

14:02.333 --> 14:05.168
Uh, why is my daughter vacuuming?

14:05.253 --> 14:08.400
Oh, Greg, no... come
on. She's play vacuuming.

14:08.425 --> 14:09.550
Yeah!

14:09.575 --> 14:11.066
So fun, right, Lark?

14:11.091 --> 14:11.972
You know what's really fun?

14:11.997 --> 14:13.768
When you get right under the couch.

14:13.793 --> 14:14.927
Yes!

14:14.952 --> 14:17.536
Yes! Okay, don't scuff the legs, okay?

14:21.511 --> 14:24.984
I am so glad that you love your jacket.

14:25.009 --> 14:28.074
- I do. I don't ever want to take it off.
- Yeah.

14:28.109 --> 14:29.909
So tell me, was it a surprise?

14:29.944 --> 14:31.444
Such a surprise.

14:31.529 --> 14:33.030
Okay. Well, happy push gift.

14:33.055 --> 14:34.425
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

14:34.449 --> 14:37.416
You know, 'cause second
babies don't just fall out.

14:37.561 --> 14:40.076
Fall out? Fall out of where?

14:42.123 --> 14:43.422
JEN: Oh, look.

14:43.458 --> 14:45.758
You did the thing we
both agreed not to do.

14:45.793 --> 14:48.575
Oh, I know. God, I know. I'm so bad.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.497
(CHUCKLES)

14:49.522 --> 14:52.215
Oh, wow. Twins.

14:52.300 --> 14:53.697
That's fun.

14:53.722 --> 14:55.101
That's not.

14:55.136 --> 14:58.580
Oh! Oh, look at us.

14:58.605 --> 15:01.916
We're like the Pink Ladies,
except our jackets are black.

15:01.941 --> 15:03.648
- We're the Black Ladies.
- No.

15:03.673 --> 15:05.682
Yeah, I'm gonna go get Santa hats,

15:05.707 --> 15:09.232
and we'll do the
Christmas photo right now.

15:09.823 --> 15:11.400
HEATHER: Clever fix, Greg.

15:11.425 --> 15:12.818
You just made it worse.

15:13.909 --> 15:16.373
What did you make worse, Greg?

15:16.398 --> 15:18.658
Look, I know that this
looks bad, it's just,

15:18.710 --> 15:20.910
I got the jacket for
Mom first. All right?

15:20.995 --> 15:23.613
And I told her that she was getting it

15:23.638 --> 15:25.164
before I realized that you wanted one.

15:25.250 --> 15:28.417
So you told her about the
gift before you gave it to her?

15:28.503 --> 15:31.573
Well, yeah, I always do, because
I worry about her and surprises.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.355
But not you. I don't have to
worry about you and surprises,

15:34.380 --> 15:37.523
which is why I got you another one.

15:38.047 --> 15:39.014
Check your pocket.

15:39.039 --> 15:43.182
What? Greg. You got me something else?

uh, this a freshener?

15:50.358 --> 15:53.442
Greg hid a bracelet in my pocket,

15:53.528 --> 15:55.319
and it's engraved.

15:55.344 --> 15:58.970
"To the most beautiful
mom, I love you forever."

breathe in your own house

16:14.432 --> 16:17.400
and stop sprinting across the
street and eating my leftovers?

16:17.435 --> 16:18.885
I drove over here.

16:18.910 --> 16:20.677
I'm a little out of breath
because of all the steps

16:20.701 --> 16:22.300
you got leading up to your front porch.

16:22.325 --> 16:23.480
There's just one.

Mm-mm. I'm counting your
welcome mat as a step.

16:26.661 --> 16:29.324
When was the last time you saw a doctor?

16:29.349 --> 16:32.631
Well, last time I looked
in the mirror, so Monday.

16:32.656 --> 16:35.574
No, no, no. When was the
last time you had a physical?

16:35.953 --> 16:39.372
Eh, doctors don't really get physicals.

16:39.457 --> 16:42.375
You know, after 40, you
should get them annually.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.960
And if you ask, they'll
send you a postcard.

16:45.046 --> 16:47.797
Sometimes it's nice to get mail.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.632

18:41.128 --> 18:42.815
or because you saw
it fall on the ground?

18:42.840 --> 18:44.321
This is a medical emergency.

18:44.346 --> 18:46.248
- Look, I'll drive you to the hospital.
- Uh-uh.

18:46.334 --> 18:47.716
I'm not gonna miss Sam's game.

18:47.752 --> 18:49.718
Doctors are wrong all the time.

18:49.743 --> 18:51.898
Come on, what-what are the
chances that my grandfather,

18:51.922 --> 18:53.505
my uncle, my dad, and I

18:53.591 --> 18:56.342
all have the same problem? (LAUGHS)

18:56.575 --> 18:57.784
Very low.

19:01.856 --> 19:03.639
(CHEERING)

19:04.176 --> 19:05.110
Hey, Dad.

19:05.135 --> 19:06.718
Hey, there she is!

19:06.804 --> 19:08.387
My little soccer star.

19:08.472 --> 19:09.803
Oh.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.482
I let 12 goals in.

19:11.534 --> 19:14.078
It's already the highest
scoring game of the season.

19:14.103 --> 19:15.185
And you were a part of it.

19:15.210 --> 19:16.075
(SIGHS)

19:16.100 --> 19:17.772
I'm so proud of you.

19:17.928 --> 19:20.091
There you are out there, just...

19:20.116 --> 19:23.067
living your life to the
fullest, seeing the world.

19:23.590 --> 19:25.723
You got to get out there
and find yourself a good guy

19:25.748 --> 19:28.310
who treats you right and
makes you laugh, right, Sam?

19:28.335 --> 19:31.335
- (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
- Above all, he's got to make you laugh.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.553
Okay, Dad.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.912
- Um, are-are you done?
- (WHISTLE BLOWS)

19:34.937 --> 19:37.842
No. No, honey, I'm not done, no.

19:38.148 --> 19:40.344
I'm gonna be around
for a long, long time.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.469
- Don't you worry. (CHUCKLES)
- (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

19:42.547 --> 19:45.131
You get out there and
soccer it up, all right?

19:45.156 --> 19:46.734
- (WHISTLE BLOWS)
- Aw.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.445
- Hey there, buddy.
- (GRUNTS)

19:49.734 --> 19:50.905
(SIGHS)

19:50.930 --> 19:52.773
Let me buy you some ice cream.

19:53.219 --> 19:55.802
Yes. Yes, that sounds good.

19:55.827 --> 19:57.111
(CHUCKLING)

19:57.196 --> 19:58.841
Yeah, a little ice
cream... just what I need

19:58.865 --> 20:01.248
to get this pizza cheese moving.

20:02.335 --> 20:05.536
Oh, really hard to decide.

20:06.044 --> 20:07.538
Well, you can have two.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.708
Yes! Two Choco Tacos, please.

20:10.793 --> 20:11.987
- (EXHALES)
- (WHISTLE BLOWS IN DISTANCE)

20:12.011 --> 20:14.295
(CHEERING IN DISTANCE)

20:14.347 --> 20:16.263
TIM: Paramedics?

20:16.299 --> 20:17.798
How could you?

20:17.850 --> 20:21.009
And I was gonna give you a
bite of my Choco Taco, too.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.054
- (INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TV)
- (GIGGLES)

20:25.717 --> 20:28.061
- Tim.
- Hey, babe.

20:28.086 --> 20:29.967
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

20:30.944 --> 20:33.381
Oh, I'm fine. They just put in a stent.

20:33.406 --> 20:34.975
What were you thinking?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.507
He was in denial.

20:36.532 --> 20:38.177
Hey, I'm the doctor here.

20:38.202 --> 20:39.873
I was in denial.

20:39.898 --> 20:42.138
But your dad saved my
life. Thank you, John.

20:42.163 --> 20:44.054
Yeah, I'm damn good in a crisis.

20:44.079 --> 20:45.139
How's Sam doing?

20:45.164 --> 20:49.000
Oh, she's okay. I told her her
dad was having a heart attack

20:49.025 --> 20:50.852
and she had to walk home.

20:50.877 --> 20:51.942
Dad!
