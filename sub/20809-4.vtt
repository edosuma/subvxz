WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:02.668
- Previously
on "AllStars..."

00:02.670 --> 00:07.873
You'll be performing
a lip sync extravaganza.

00:07.875 --> 00:13.278
¶ Herstory ¶

00:13.280 --> 00:16.615
- Do you think that
the girls in the top

00:16.617 --> 00:18.717
are going to stick
to our idea of

00:18.719 --> 00:20.886
what do the judges
have to say

00:20.888 --> 00:22.888
and that's who
we're going to choose?

00:22.890 --> 00:25.090
- I'm iffy of one of them.
- Who?

00:25.092 --> 00:26.392
- Alyssa.

00:26.394 --> 00:30.462
- Alyssa Edwards,
you're a winner, baby.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.534
Which queen
have you chosen

00:35.536 --> 00:36.468
to get the chop?

00:36.470 --> 00:38.037
- Sometimes
being in the bottom

00:38.039 --> 00:41.673
could just be
a one night kind of gig.

00:41.675 --> 00:45.010
So the queen
that I'm sending home,

00:45.012 --> 00:47.679
that's Ginger.

00:47.681 --> 00:51.884
- Ginger Minj, sashay away.

01:00.628 --> 01:03.028
- Whoo, shit.

01:03.030 --> 01:04.463
- Oh...

01:04.465 --> 01:06.532
- Good old Minj Ging.

01:06.534 --> 01:07.900
- What we said
we were gonna do

01:07.902 --> 01:10.536
was eliminate the girl
who got the harshest critiques.

01:10.538 --> 01:15.541
I just feel that Katya got
harsher critiques than Ginger,

01:15.543 --> 01:17.443
so the vibe
in the room right now

01:17.445 --> 01:20.312
is kind of like
what just happened?

01:20.314 --> 01:23.082
- I wanna say that
both of you guys

01:23.084 --> 01:26.752
got feedback that was
kind of on the lower end,

01:26.754 --> 01:27.986
but when
I really talked to you guys

01:27.988 --> 01:30.556
after looking at last week
and the week before

01:30.558 --> 01:32.057
and taking all that
into consideration,

01:32.059 --> 01:32.858
I think you're consistent

01:32.860 --> 01:34.493
and I think you have
so much more to give.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.028
I think
you just fell short today.

01:36.030 --> 01:38.130
I think what Ginger does
is fabulous,

01:38.132 --> 01:40.666
but I didn't feel like it
was fair send to Katya home

01:40.668 --> 01:43.402
'cause I was going
based off consistency.

01:43.404 --> 01:44.369
Katya, I know
you looked at me

01:44.371 --> 01:45.471
and you were
a little surprised,

01:45.473 --> 01:47.072
but you should never
be surprised.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.707
I think
you deserve to be here,

01:48.709 --> 01:50.542
and that's just me
following my heart

01:50.544 --> 01:52.344
and keeping it real
with you guys.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.346
I think Ru would have
taken into consideration

01:54.348 --> 01:56.882
what she just did the week
before in the Snatch Game.

01:56.884 --> 02:00.352
She hit a homerun,
so tough decision to make.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.187
I stand by my decision 100%.

02:02.189 --> 02:03.755
Detox, how did you feel?
I mean...

02:03.757 --> 02:07.493
- I based my decision
off of the critiques.

02:07.495 --> 02:08.193
- Okay.

02:08.195 --> 02:10.129
- And my decision was you.

02:10.131 --> 02:12.264
And you know how much
I fuckin live for you.

02:12.266 --> 02:12.865
- Of course.

02:12.867 --> 02:14.166
- And this is a fuckin
tough decision to make.

02:14.168 --> 02:16.735
- I hope that that you see
that just consistency for me--

02:16.737 --> 02:17.603
- No, and I do.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.939
- Me personally,
I would still go with you

02:20.941 --> 02:23.542
only because
I said from day one

02:23.544 --> 02:25.177
I was going
to play it that way.

02:25.179 --> 02:26.778
Alyssa switched it up.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.213
It's pretty obvious.

02:28.215 --> 02:30.182
Katya, should have
gone home tonight.

02:30.184 --> 02:32.784
I feel that
if Ru was up there judging,

02:32.786 --> 02:35.420
she would have
actually sent you home.

02:36.157 --> 02:39.358
- I'm struggling
with the thought

02:39.360 --> 02:41.059
that maybe the other girls

02:41.061 --> 02:44.997
don't think this was
a fair elimination.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.699
- Katya, you're here.
Let it all go.

02:47.701 --> 02:50.169
I'm very confident
with my decision.

02:50.171 --> 02:53.071
We can all agree
to disagree.

02:53.073 --> 02:56.108
Alyssa keeps bringing up
consistency, consistency,

02:56.110 --> 02:58.544
and I don't know
which way she's gonna go.

02:58.546 --> 03:02.214
So if she wins again,
who's going home?

03:05.553 --> 03:08.453
- The winner of "RuPaul's
Drag Race AllStars"

03:08.455 --> 03:09.788
receives a one year supply

03:09.790 --> 03:12.024
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics,

03:12.026 --> 03:15.093
a coveted spot
in the Drag Race Hall of Fame,

03:15.095 --> 03:18.063
and a cash prize
of $100,000.

03:18.065 --> 03:21.867
With extra special guest judge
Nicole Scherzinger.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.435
- ¶ "RuPaul's Drag Race" ¶

03:23.437 --> 03:24.770
- ¶ May the best woman ¶

03:24.772 --> 03:27.573
- ¶ Best woman win ¶

03:30.978 --> 03:32.744
- New week, new me.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.613
- Yeah, baby!
- Yep.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.014
- We're walking
into the workroom,

03:36.016 --> 03:38.517
and I notice that
there's a little letter

03:38.519 --> 03:40.419
written by old Ging Minj.

03:40.421 --> 03:44.189
- "PLay a fair game
and be proud of your choices,"

03:44.191 --> 03:47.192
- So is she implying that
the game hasn't been fair?

03:47.194 --> 03:49.061
- You know why?
I think because--

03:49.063 --> 03:50.028
Look, let's be honest.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.730
We all said
that we were gonna pick

03:51.732 --> 03:54.433
who Ru said was,
you know, the weakest link,

03:54.435 --> 03:55.934
and Alyssa switched it up.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.502
- No, I didn't switch
nothing up, baby.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.471
- No, I'm saying--
Will you let me finish?

03:59.473 --> 04:01.406
- No, but let's choose
our words wisely.

04:01.408 --> 04:02.874
- I am.
You didn't let me finish.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.876
What I'm saying
is you switched it up,

04:04.878 --> 04:07.045
which you did,
and in all honesty,

04:07.047 --> 04:08.046
they critiqued you
on your--

04:08.048 --> 04:09.081
Hold on, baby.
Let me finish.

04:09.083 --> 04:13.252
They critiqued you on your
runway and your performance.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.821
- Phi Phi is a little
hung up on the decision

04:15.823 --> 04:18.924
because I think in her head,
she probably could be thinking,

04:18.926 --> 04:21.526
okay, well,
this could affect me.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.128
I was in the bottom
the first time.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.464
There was a lot of factors
taken into consideration,

04:25.466 --> 04:28.066
but I do think I was fair
in my opinion.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.468
I think, you know,
it's hard.

04:29.470 --> 04:32.037
It's very hard,
but I stand by it.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.105
- Katya, how do you feel?

04:33.107 --> 04:35.173
- I mean, you know,
she made the decision.

04:35.175 --> 04:37.309
She feels proud of it.
I'm happy to be here.

04:37.311 --> 04:38.110
End of story. Boom.

04:38.112 --> 04:40.178
- Ha! Take that, everyone.
You're back.

04:40.180 --> 04:43.815
- I am ready to shrug off
the guilt and shame and doubt

04:43.817 --> 04:45.083
like a lice-ridden coat.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.352
- It's going to be interesting
to see what happens

04:47.354 --> 04:48.153
down to the nitty gritty

04:48.155 --> 04:50.155
how fair the game
continues to be played.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.090
- If y'all send me home,
it was rigged.

04:52.092 --> 04:56.295
Riga-morris, girl.
It was riga-morris, girl.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.263
- Who's Morris?

04:58.699 --> 05:01.600
Rigormortis.
- Is it rigormortis?

05:01.602 --> 05:05.370
(all laugh)

05:05.372 --> 05:07.239
- Hello, hello, hello.

05:07.241 --> 05:09.508
- Oh!
(applause)

05:09.510 --> 05:10.575
- You look gorg.

05:10.577 --> 05:14.613
- Ladies, for this week's
maxi challenge,

05:14.615 --> 05:18.283
you'll be starring
in drag shequels.

05:18.285 --> 05:22.154
Parodies inspired by
some of my favorite movies.

05:22.156 --> 05:24.122
#DragShequels.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.390
- Oh.
- All right.

05:25.392 --> 05:26.958
- You'll be working
in pairs,

05:26.960 --> 05:32.531
so first, I want you
to pick your acting partner.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.901
Go.

05:35.903 --> 05:36.935
- All right.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.770
- I look and see Roxxxy,

05:38.772 --> 05:39.638
I look and see Phi Phi,

05:39.640 --> 05:42.708
and I'm thinking,
where the fuck is Detox?

05:42.710 --> 05:43.942
- Well?

05:43.944 --> 05:44.476
- Detox.

05:44.478 --> 05:47.713
So I grab her because
I am not gonna be stuck

05:47.715 --> 05:49.648
with a weak performer
for this challenge.

05:49.650 --> 05:50.482
- All right.

05:50.484 --> 05:54.453
- Now, I've green-lit
the following films.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.521
First up, "Showsquirrels,"

05:56.523 --> 06:01.526
starring Phi Phi O'Hara
and Roxxxy Andrews.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.961
- Yes!

06:02.963 --> 06:05.897
- Next, "Velma and Weezy,"

06:05.899 --> 06:08.967
starring Katya and Detox.

06:08.969 --> 06:09.801
- Yes.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.536
- Last but not least,

06:11.538 --> 06:14.773
"Wha' Ha' Happened
To Baby JJ?"

06:14.775 --> 06:18.610
starring Alaska
and Alyssa Edwards.

06:18.612 --> 06:21.146
To create your characters,
you can use wigs

06:21.148 --> 06:22.981
provided by Weaven Steven.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.717
And if the script
calls for it, the pit crew,

06:25.719 --> 06:29.888
in or out of their
Andrew Christian underwear.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.824
Gentlemen,
start your engines,

06:32.826 --> 06:35.193
and may
the best woman win.

06:35.195 --> 06:36.928
(applause)

06:38.699 --> 06:39.865
- The parody shequel.

06:39.867 --> 06:44.770
Katya and I are assigned
the "Velma and Weezy" script,

06:44.772 --> 06:45.704
which is a shequel

06:45.706 --> 06:48.073
to another
very famous movie

06:48.075 --> 06:51.209
with similar
character names.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.477
Are we doing accents?

06:52.479 --> 06:53.645
- I think so.
- I think so.

06:53.647 --> 06:54.813
- We have to. Yeah.

06:54.815 --> 06:58.617
If you can't eat your friends,
who can you eat?

06:58.619 --> 07:00.552
- (laughs)

07:00.554 --> 07:01.686
- "Showsquirrels."

07:01.688 --> 07:04.322
Mama Versayce, a middle-aged
former showgirl.

07:04.324 --> 07:04.923
- Accurate.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.892
- We chose to make me
Mama Versayce

07:06.894 --> 07:09.194
and Phi Phi's gonna be
Lil' Versayce.

07:09.196 --> 07:12.631
- No, you were just
a tired-ass showgirl.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.499
- You were just
a tired-ass showgirl.

07:14.501 --> 07:17.102
Now go back to obscurity
where you belong.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.069
- Oh, my God.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.504
I've heard that somewhere.

07:19.506 --> 07:21.740
- I feel like
I'm typecasted.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.575
- Okay, let's get
these costumes together.

07:23.577 --> 07:26.611
- No pressure,
but like I'm the only one

07:26.613 --> 07:29.214
left of the girls that
has not been in the top yet.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.082
What if we switched it

07:31.084 --> 07:34.286
and like you were
the big pageant girl?

07:35.823 --> 07:37.856
It's all about taking chances
and doing something.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.258
Switching the roles
is a brilliant idea.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.427
I'm telling you, I just think
that would be so much funnier.

07:42.429 --> 07:44.396
And then you--
- You're scaring me.

07:44.398 --> 07:46.131
I just get scared
of those things,

07:46.133 --> 07:48.033
but I know that you're good
at what you do.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.302
- I really think we should.
- Okay.

07:50.304 --> 07:54.039
- I know it's a risk,
but I'm gonna take it.

07:54.041 --> 07:57.142
And Roxxxy has no choice
but to follow.

07:58.178 --> 07:58.844
- Coming up...

07:58.846 --> 08:02.280
- We take the crown.
We wear the shaw.

08:02.282 --> 08:06.585
- Cut.
Um, what's a shaw?

08:06.587 --> 08:08.253
- Huh?

08:09.590 --> 08:11.957
(RuPaul laughs)

08:12.826 --> 08:15.627
(RuPaul laughs)

08:15.629 --> 08:19.764
- I was never a whore.
I was a dancer!

08:19.766 --> 08:22.367
- You were suh--
[stammers]

08:22.369 --> 08:23.301
- That's not the line.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.737
- For this week's
maxi challenge,

08:25.739 --> 08:27.706
Alyssa and I are assigned

08:27.708 --> 08:30.942
"Wha' Ha' Happened
To Baby JJ?"

08:30.944 --> 08:34.479
(evil laugh)

08:34.481 --> 08:36.381
For me,
there's no question.

08:36.383 --> 08:37.983
I have to play Baby JJ.

08:37.985 --> 08:42.320
She's old and crazy
and evil.

08:42.322 --> 08:45.457
Where do you think you're going,
you miserable bitch?

08:45.459 --> 08:49.160
- No!
- There's really no choice.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.228
Sorry, Alyssa.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.597
I work alone.

08:54.668 --> 08:55.333
- I hope we win.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.536
I'd like to be
at the top two once.

09:00.107 --> 09:00.739
Thank you.

09:00.741 --> 09:01.706
- How does that
make you feel?

09:01.708 --> 09:03.742
- I'm a little intimidated,
to be honest.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.644
Since Alyssa changed it up,

09:05.646 --> 09:07.479
which--even though she
wants to pretend she didn't.

09:07.481 --> 09:09.881
- You feel like
she flipped the script.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.616
- I don't feel.
She did flip the script.

09:11.618 --> 09:13.451
I'm not saying I don't want you
here, but you know what I mean?

09:13.453 --> 09:15.353
- No, no, no, no, no.
I completely get it.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.555
- Like, is that gonna be,
like, oh, well,

09:16.557 --> 09:19.057
Phi Phi's never been in the top,
so let's get rid of her.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.459
So I don't know.
We'll see what happens.

09:21.461 --> 09:22.394
I'm a little frustrated.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.528
I don't want
to leave the competition

09:23.530 --> 09:25.797
until I've had a chance
to make the world

09:25.799 --> 09:26.898
fall in love with Phi Phi.

09:26.900 --> 09:30.502
And I need a win now
to prove that I need to be here.

09:34.708 --> 09:35.240
- Howdy.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.342
- Hi, Katya and Detox.
- Hi, y'all.

09:37.344 --> 09:38.143
- So pretty.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.778
- So it's time
for Detox and I

09:39.780 --> 09:42.247
to perform in our shequel,
"Velma and Weezy."

09:42.249 --> 09:46.217
And I have never felt more sexy
in my entire life.

09:46.219 --> 09:49.621
- Your parody shequel.
And action!

09:49.623 --> 09:51.756
- We don't need money,
Velma.

09:51.758 --> 09:52.591
We're zombies.

09:52.593 --> 09:55.760
- We need the cash
to get drunk.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.162
Fuck. Buy booze.

09:57.164 --> 09:59.197
- Yeah, we need the cash
to buy booze.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.565
- Um, start over, okay.

10:00.567 --> 10:03.201
- Bitch,
this is the shequel!

10:03.203 --> 10:06.104
- Uh!

10:06.106 --> 10:07.272
Fuck. I forgot.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.274
- Cut.
Get those lines down

10:09.276 --> 10:12.243
so the back and forth
can be more organic.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.011
- Have fun with this.

10:13.013 --> 10:16.381
One of the first rules of acting
is reacting to the other people.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.083
- I'm not totally
in the moment.

10:18.085 --> 10:21.152
I just think, what the hell
would Amy Sedaris do?

10:21.154 --> 10:22.921
- And action!

10:22.923 --> 10:23.622
(knock on door)

10:23.624 --> 10:26.091
- You order room service?
- No.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.659
- Oh, motherfucker.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.961
- (laughs)

10:29.963 --> 10:34.466
- 'Cause suddenly
I'm very hungry.

10:34.468 --> 10:35.066
- Whoo-hoo!

10:35.068 --> 10:38.603
- Weezy, you zombie skank,
you motherfuckin--

10:38.605 --> 10:39.404
I just fuck you.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.006
If I wasn't dead already,
I'd--

10:41.008 --> 10:43.308
- And cut.
Best one yet.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.877
- Great.
- Fantastic.

10:48.849 --> 10:51.616
Hello, Alaska and Alyssa.

10:51.618 --> 10:52.283
- Hi.

10:52.285 --> 10:55.387
- "Wha' Ha' Happened
To Baby JJ?"

10:55.389 --> 10:55.920
Action!

10:55.922 --> 11:00.859
- Guess who's in a wheelchair
now, Bland?

11:00.861 --> 11:02.794
- You know
I haven't been able

11:02.796 --> 11:05.296
to use my legs
since the accident.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.431
- And cut.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.366
Alyssa, you're scared
of your sister,

11:08.368 --> 11:10.535
but you still have a voice,
so you don't--

11:10.537 --> 11:11.436
Every (mumbles)

11:11.438 --> 11:13.271
Let us hear
what you're saying.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.506
- Okay.
- Action!

11:14.508 --> 11:18.343
- ¶ Camptown ladies,
sing this song ¶

11:18.345 --> 11:21.680
- ¶ Doo-wah, doo-wah ¶

11:21.682 --> 11:22.213
- Cut!

11:22.215 --> 11:24.349
- It's doo-dah.
¶ Doo-dah ¶

11:24.351 --> 11:26.017
- ¶ Doo-dah ¶
- Correct.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.585
You just have to say...

11:27.587 --> 11:30.121
- [both] Doo-dah, doo-dah.

11:30.123 --> 11:30.855
Here we go.

11:30.857 --> 11:35.160
- ¶ Camptown ladies
sing this song ¶

11:35.162 --> 11:37.929
- ¶ Doo-wah, doo-wah ¶

11:37.931 --> 11:42.100
- ¶ Camptown racetrack
five miles long ¶

11:42.102 --> 11:43.668
- Cut.
Doo-dah.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.236
- Doo-dah.
- Doo-dah.

11:45.238 --> 11:48.406
- Oh, to do--
¶ oh, da doo-dah ¶

11:49.743 --> 11:52.711
- Welcome,
Phi Phi and Roxxxy.

11:52.713 --> 11:53.745
- Hi!

11:53.747 --> 11:54.979
- "Showsquirrels."

11:54.981 --> 11:57.282
All right. Here we go.
- Action!

11:57.284 --> 12:00.819
- I used to love
eating dog chow.

12:00.821 --> 12:08.193
- Ugh. So you're telling me
that not only be conce--line.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.028
- I thought being conceived
in a swimming pool.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.864
- So you're telling me
being conceived in a swim--

12:12.866 --> 12:16.668
- No. Ugh.
I thought being conce--

12:16.670 --> 12:17.435
- Oh. Ugh.

12:17.437 --> 12:21.873
I thought being conceived
in a swimming pool was gross.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.575
(gags)

12:25.245 --> 12:26.711
(gags)

12:26.713 --> 12:27.212
- Cut.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.714
- I just want you
to give me more character.

12:29.716 --> 12:31.750
I feel like I'm seeing
a lot of Roxxxy in there.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.618
I think that
you could do something

12:33.620 --> 12:34.819
to push it to another level.

12:34.821 --> 12:37.388
- Okay.
- And action!

12:37.390 --> 12:41.159
- We take the crown.
We wear the shaw.

12:41.161 --> 12:45.830
- Cut.
Um, what's a shaw?

12:47.667 --> 12:49.434
Roxxxy?
- Huh?

12:49.436 --> 12:52.470
- We take the crown.
We wear the shaw.

12:52.472 --> 12:55.073
- We take the crown.
We wear the shaw, the...

12:55.075 --> 12:57.475
- Sash.
- How you spell it?

12:57.477 --> 12:58.376
- Sash?

12:58.378 --> 12:59.944
- S-A-S-H?
- Yeah.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.847
- Sha...sha...

13:02.849 --> 13:04.649
- Sash.
- Sash.

13:04.651 --> 13:08.319
Oh, God. This isn't another
sequins moment, is it?

13:08.321 --> 13:10.789
- I'm afraid so, honey.

13:10.791 --> 13:13.358
- That is a wrap
on "Showsquirrels."

13:13.360 --> 13:14.392
- See you on the runway.

13:14.394 --> 13:15.994
- In the end, I want to say

13:15.996 --> 13:18.163
that we
might not be the best,

13:18.165 --> 13:21.633
but Team Phoxxxy did A-OK.

13:21.635 --> 13:22.233
- Coming up...

13:22.235 --> 13:24.202
- You're gorgina.
- You did a great job.

13:24.204 --> 13:27.705
- Little things in this
situation have to matter.

13:27.707 --> 13:30.141
(RuPaul laughs)

13:30.911 --> 13:33.745
(RuPaul laughs)

13:35.982 --> 13:40.218
- ¶ Covergirl,
put the bass in your walk ¶

13:43.423 --> 13:46.658
¶ Covergirl, put the bass
in your walk ¶

13:46.660 --> 13:51.262
¶ Head to toe,
let your whole body talk ¶

13:51.264 --> 13:52.597
¶ Covergirl ¶

13:52.599 --> 13:55.166
- Wow.

13:55.168 --> 13:55.900
(RuPaul laughs)

13:55.902 --> 14:00.338
- Welcome to the main stage of
"RuPaul's Drag Race AllStars."

14:00.340 --> 14:05.343
Star of the classic film,
"Boobarella," Michelle Visage.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.813
- And the TV show,
"Leave It To Cleavage."

14:08.815 --> 14:10.348
- (laughs)

14:10.350 --> 14:12.817
Style superstar,
Carson Kressley.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.052
I love what you're wearing.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.753
- Thank you.
(misprounouncing) It's Versayce.

14:15.755 --> 14:19.190
- (laughs) The incredible
Todrick Hall.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.959
Now, how'd it go
with my girls yesterday?

14:20.961 --> 14:24.162
- Ru, I'm gonna have to give
your girls two thumbs up.

14:24.164 --> 14:27.465
- Try three.
They'll enjoy it much more.

14:27.467 --> 14:28.066
(all laugh)

14:28.068 --> 14:33.671
And the devastatingly gorgeous
and talented Nicole Scherzinger.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.039
You finally made it.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.207
- Yes, my love.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.443
You're giving me
fierce tiger fish

14:38.445 --> 14:39.377
with that dress right now.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.813
- Thank you.
So glad you're here.

14:41.815 --> 14:44.415
Now, this week,
we challenged our queens

14:44.417 --> 14:46.451
to star in movie shequels.

14:46.453 --> 14:49.954
And tonight, it's double trouble
on the runway

14:49.956 --> 14:54.058
because the category
is two looks in one,

14:54.060 --> 14:55.960
inspired by Violet Chachki.

14:55.962 --> 15:01.399
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.334
- ¶ Gotta go now ¶

15:03.336 --> 15:05.303
- ¶ Sexy, sexy ¶

15:05.305 --> 15:07.939
- Up first, Phi Phi O'Hara.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.841
- Ooh, she's crowning.

15:09.843 --> 15:11.209
- She is.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.077
- That's a nice ascot.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.046
- Ah, yes.
- Beautiful.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.214
- I'm super proud
of this look.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.449
I came up with
the design myself,

15:18.451 --> 15:20.084
and I feel gorgeous.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.986
- If it's yellow,
let it mellow.

15:21.988 --> 15:22.921
(all laugh)

15:22.923 --> 15:25.056
- Roxxxy Andrews.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.157
- Flamenco.

15:26.159 --> 15:29.093
- Sombrero.
- Yes.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.396
- Oh!
- Yes, please.

15:31.398 --> 15:32.730
Selena in the house.

15:32.732 --> 15:33.564
- Hello.

15:33.566 --> 15:36.100
- If anybody knows anything
about a reveal,

15:36.102 --> 15:37.468
she, me, her, she does.

15:37.470 --> 15:40.738
I'm serving Latina diva
on this runway.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.040
- Bitty, bitty, bum-bum.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.475
- That's a Spanish fly girl.

15:44.477 --> 15:47.011
Katya.
Ooh, Barbara Eden.

15:47.013 --> 15:49.047
- I dream of weenie.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.581
- Oh, there she goes.

15:50.583 --> 15:51.950
- Oh!

15:51.952 --> 15:55.453
- Oh, thank you.
- (laughs)

15:55.455 --> 15:58.156
- I'm giving you full health
by a Sharon Tate fantasy.

15:58.158 --> 16:03.528
It's Rosemary's babushka,
and I feel (deep voice) amazing.

16:03.530 --> 16:07.832
- Not tonight, Satan.
Not tonight.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.067
Detox.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.635
- Dark lady.
- Sexy.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.805
- Oh.
- Oh, yes.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.674
Oh, and there's more.

16:16.676 --> 16:17.709
- Every time
I step on the runway,

16:17.711 --> 16:19.110
I want it to be
something different.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.478
I want to blow them away.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.313
- Oh!

16:22.315 --> 16:24.615
- And that's the fun
of drag to me.

16:24.617 --> 16:25.616
- Kung-pow.

16:25.618 --> 16:28.486
- Ancient Chinese secret,
huh?

16:28.488 --> 16:29.854
- (giggles)

16:29.856 --> 16:33.057
- Here she comes,
Alyssa Edwards.

16:33.059 --> 16:35.793
Ooh, the Le Croix poof.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.762
- Yes.
- What?

16:37.764 --> 16:39.297
- I'm ready for my closeup.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.733
- Ah.
- Oh, I love it.

16:41.735 --> 16:45.236
- Girl, please. I'm taking
selfie to a whole 'nother level.

16:45.238 --> 16:45.970
Paparazzi who?

16:45.972 --> 16:49.474
Oh, I see why you love me,
darling.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.209
- That is amazing.

16:51.211 --> 16:54.212
- Kodak mammaries.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.714
Up next, Alaska.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.584
What?
It's like a Fellini film.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.619
(gasps)
- What the--

17:01.621 --> 17:03.221
- Oh.
(all laugh)

17:03.223 --> 17:06.858
- It's Little Poundcake!

17:06.860 --> 17:08.126
(all laugh)

17:08.128 --> 17:11.796
- Little Poundcake
is the insane pageant girl.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.465
She's stunning,
and I'm really excited

17:14.467 --> 17:16.067
to get to bring her to life.

17:16.069 --> 17:19.137
- I think she needs
some go-go juice.

17:19.139 --> 17:22.673
- ¶ Sexy, sexy drag queen ¶

17:22.675 --> 17:23.508
- Welcome, ladies.

17:23.510 --> 17:28.479
It's time for the world premiere
of your movie parodies.

17:28.481 --> 17:33.584
First, Phi Phi O'Hara
and Roxxxy Andrews

17:33.586 --> 17:37.255
starring in "Showsquirrels."

17:37.257 --> 17:40.391
When last we saw
our troubled showgirl,

17:40.393 --> 17:42.593
she was hitchhiking
to Hollywood

17:42.595 --> 17:47.131
after crashing and burning
in Sin City.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.199
Now, years later,

17:48.201 --> 17:52.637
her own daughter
is a junior pageant queen

17:52.639 --> 17:55.306
bitten by the showbiz bug.

17:55.642 --> 17:59.043
- All right. Five minutes
till the talent competition.

17:59.045 --> 18:00.611
- You heard him.
Only five,

18:00.613 --> 18:02.814
fa-five, five, five minutes.

18:02.816 --> 18:05.416
- Thanks, darling.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.120
- Hey, little Versayce.

18:09.122 --> 18:10.588
I just know you're gonna win

18:10.590 --> 18:14.058
the Wee Little
Miss Pacoima Goddess Supreme.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.560
- That wouldn't suck.

18:15.562 --> 18:16.561
- Now, remember,
Little Versayce,

18:16.563 --> 18:18.029
when you get
in front of them judges,

18:18.031 --> 18:22.834
do some of them dance moves
your mama taught you in Vegas.

18:23.436 --> 18:28.473
- I'm a little too young
for that whorish look.

18:28.475 --> 18:29.307
- Ooh!

18:29.309 --> 18:31.742
But you are a whore, mommy.

18:33.213 --> 18:36.347
- Versayce, how dare you?

18:36.349 --> 18:39.650
I was a dancer. Huh.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.621
- I don't know what the hell
you did in Vegas,

18:43.623 --> 18:45.523
but it sure wasn't dancing.

18:45.525 --> 18:48.226
- I was the biggest star
on the strip.

18:48.228 --> 18:53.865
They could've gotten
LaToya Jackson, Paula Abdul,

18:53.867 --> 18:56.234
but The Stardust
went with me,

18:56.236 --> 18:58.903
and, frankly,
I still got it.

18:58.905 --> 19:01.139
- You are just
a tired-ass showgirl!

19:01.141 --> 19:06.110
Go back to obscurity
where you belong!

19:06.112 --> 19:08.412
- Obscurity?

19:11.518 --> 19:12.383
(laughs)

19:12.385 --> 19:16.954
Now, go on, show them what
you got, Little Versayce.

19:16.956 --> 19:20.491
- Don't worry about me,
mommy.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.593
I will.

19:24.130 --> 19:25.263
- Aah!

19:25.265 --> 19:27.765
(all laugh)

19:27.767 --> 19:29.667
Mommy, how could you?

19:29.669 --> 19:34.272
- I guess you don't...
know me.

19:34.274 --> 19:37.141
- Oh!
(all laugh)

19:38.945 --> 19:41.879
- Up next, Katya and Detox

19:41.881 --> 19:45.917
starring in
"Velma and Weezy."

19:46.553 --> 19:49.954
When last we saw
Velma and Weezy,

19:49.956 --> 19:51.489
they were taking a short cut

19:51.491 --> 19:54.192
to the bottom
of the Grand Canyon.

19:54.194 --> 19:59.230
They may be dead,
but they're still best friends.

20:01.067 --> 20:03.434
- Where is she?

20:04.170 --> 20:06.871
Velma,
what took you so long?

20:06.873 --> 20:09.173
I think I'm having
a nervous breakdown.

20:09.175 --> 20:11.309
- The Quicki-mart
didn't sell brains,

20:11.311 --> 20:14.078
so I ate the clerk's brains
instead.

20:14.080 --> 20:17.315
- Ah.
- Oh, and I robbed the store.

20:17.317 --> 20:20.685
- We don't need money,
Velma.

20:20.687 --> 20:21.619
We're zombies.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.721
Hold on.
I got a great idea.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.189
- Oh.
- Whew.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.024
Selfie!

20:29.062 --> 20:30.394
- Whoo-hoo-ee!

20:30.396 --> 20:31.929
(knock on door)

20:31.931 --> 20:34.332
- You order room service?
- No.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.833
- Motherfucker!

20:38.738 --> 20:43.007
'Cause suddenly
I'm very hungry.

20:43.009 --> 20:43.608
- Whoo-hoo!

20:43.610 --> 20:47.245
If it isn't that handsome
Brad Pitt lookalike

20:47.247 --> 20:49.113
that stole all our money.

20:49.115 --> 20:50.114
What are you doing here, BJ?

20:50.116 --> 20:55.353
- You come back to give us that
money you stole from us, baby?

20:55.355 --> 20:56.320
With interest?

20:56.322 --> 20:58.556
- Maybe he's just here
to see what it's like

20:58.558 --> 21:03.494
to get some head
from the walking dead.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.329
- Bitch, he's mine!

21:05.331 --> 21:06.497
- Oh!

21:06.499 --> 21:08.432
Bitch, this is a shequel!

21:08.434 --> 21:13.170
- Weezy, you zombie skank!
You motherfuckin--

21:13.172 --> 21:16.040
(both shouting)

21:17.443 --> 21:19.777
Aah!

21:19.779 --> 21:20.711
Look what you did!

21:20.713 --> 21:23.114
- Look what you did!

21:27.553 --> 21:29.353
- Thanks, ladies.

21:29.589 --> 21:33.858
- That sexy son of a bitch
took our money again.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.693
- No matter what happens,

21:35.695 --> 21:39.997
I'm glad I got to be
a zombie with you.

21:39.999 --> 21:44.268
- I've never felt more...
dead?

21:44.270 --> 21:46.137
Hey, Velma, do you mind

21:46.139 --> 21:48.205
if I partake
in your little arm here?

21:48.207 --> 21:53.010
- If you can't eat your friends,
who can you eat?

21:53.012 --> 21:56.280
(all laugh)

21:56.783 --> 21:59.016
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.551
- That's so cute.

22:00.553 --> 22:04.789
- All right. Up next,
Alyssa Edwards and Alaska

22:04.791 --> 22:09.060
in "Wha' Ha' Happened
to Baby JJ?"

22:09.062 --> 22:11.696
When last we saw Baby JJ,

22:11.698 --> 22:17.435
she nearly killed her sister
Bland on the beach.

22:17.437 --> 22:19.170
But she survived.

22:19.172 --> 22:22.373
Now, 50 years later,

22:22.375 --> 22:27.144
they're still trapped together
at the senior home.

22:28.414 --> 22:30.247
(door creaks)

22:42.295 --> 22:44.762
(beeping)

22:48.234 --> 22:52.737
- Guess who's in
a wheelchair now, Bland?

22:53.139 --> 22:56.140
Just kidding.
You are!

22:56.142 --> 22:57.208
- Baby JJ?

22:57.210 --> 23:00.845
You know I haven't been able to
use my legs since the accident.

23:00.847 --> 23:06.450
I'd escape from you
if I wasn't 109 years old.

23:06.452 --> 23:10.354
- But you are, Bland.
You are!

23:10.356 --> 23:12.022
Look over here.

23:12.024 --> 23:13.758
It's your din-din.

23:13.760 --> 23:14.658
- Oh, no.

23:14.660 --> 23:18.129
- I made your favorite.

23:18.131 --> 23:19.597
Pork chops!

23:19.599 --> 23:20.865
- Aah!

23:20.867 --> 23:23.968
- (evil laugh)

23:25.938 --> 23:26.470
Come on.

23:26.472 --> 23:29.874
We gotta rehearse
for the talent show.

23:31.978 --> 23:34.311
- Oh, my God.

23:34.313 --> 23:36.180
- My music's over there.

23:36.182 --> 23:38.282
- (grunts)

23:38.284 --> 23:38.883
Never mind.

23:38.885 --> 23:43.554
I'm gonna do this one
Acapulco.

23:43.556 --> 23:47.958
(off-key) ¶ Camptown ladies

23:47.960 --> 23:50.628
- ¶ Doo-dah, doo-dah ¶

23:50.630 --> 23:52.329
- Hey!
- Ow!

23:52.331 --> 23:55.132
- Sorry, sis, I work alone.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.767
- Somebody help me!

23:56.769 --> 23:58.436
She's emotionally disturbed!

23:58.438 --> 24:02.840
- Where do you think you're
going, you miserable bitch?

24:02.842 --> 24:05.576
- No! No!

24:05.578 --> 24:08.779
- Oh, girl down.

24:08.781 --> 24:11.315
- My sister Bland fell.

24:11.317 --> 24:12.850
Can you help her?

24:12.852 --> 24:14.952
- Of course.
Come on, Bland.

24:16.556 --> 24:18.355
- Oh!

24:18.357 --> 24:21.725
See? Even the nurse
likes you better.

24:21.727 --> 24:25.463
- ¶ Camptown ladies

24:25.465 --> 24:26.897

24:26.899 --> 24:29.200

24:29.202 --> 24:31.202

24:31.204 --> 24:33.971

24:33.973 --> 24:36.574
(applause)

24:37.310 --> 24:41.178
- Now, it's time
for the judges' reviews.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.379
- Coming up...

24:42.381 --> 24:44.248
- You were like
the Dustin Hoffman

24:44.250 --> 24:46.250
of, like, queens for acting.

24:46.252 --> 24:47.651
- You needed a lot of work.

24:47.653 --> 24:48.953
We shouldn't give you passes

24:48.955 --> 24:51.622
because we've all been guilty
of going, that don't--

24:51.624 --> 24:53.424
she's so funny,
that don't even matter.

24:53.426 --> 24:54.859
No, but it does.

24:54.861 --> 24:57.294
(RuPaul laughs)

24:58.130 --> 25:00.364
(RuPaul laughs)

25:00.366 --> 25:04.335
- Ladies, now it's time
for the judges' reviews.

25:04.337 --> 25:06.570
First up, Phi Phi O'Hara.

25:06.572 --> 25:08.072
- Let's talk about
your runway look.

25:08.074 --> 25:11.575
Each of the looks
individually, hmm, okay.

25:11.577 --> 25:13.177
What I think you executed
so well

25:13.179 --> 25:15.412
was how it converted.
- Mm-hmm.

25:15.414 --> 25:17.248
- That took
a lot of ingenuity.

25:17.250 --> 25:19.884
If this doesn't work out,
you could work at NASA.

25:19.886 --> 25:22.286
- As far as the performance,

25:22.288 --> 25:25.389
you know it's my all-time
favorite movie.

25:25.391 --> 25:25.923
- Yeah.

25:25.925 --> 25:29.059
- And I was literally
so proud of you.

25:29.061 --> 25:29.727
- Oh, thank you.

25:29.729 --> 25:33.063
- Not only did you look
just like Mama Versayce,

25:33.065 --> 25:34.698
but you embodied
the character.

25:34.700 --> 25:37.334
- You did a great job.
- Yes.

25:37.336 --> 25:38.969
I've been trying so hard

25:38.971 --> 25:41.939
throughout this
entire competition. Ah!

25:41.941 --> 25:46.043
And you guys like it,
I don't know what to say.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.645
- All right.
Thank you very much.

25:47.647 --> 25:50.381
Up next, Roxxxy Andrews.

25:50.383 --> 25:51.482
- You're gorgina.
- You are.

25:51.484 --> 25:54.885
Like, I don't even want
to look at you you're so pretty.

25:54.887 --> 25:57.922
- Ah! The outfit.
I want to borrow that.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.089
It's so creative,
so beautiful.

25:59.091 --> 26:03.594
- The bad part for you
was Phi Phi was so strong

26:03.596 --> 26:05.930
that it was hard to keep up.

26:05.932 --> 26:08.232
With you, I think
you had to work harder

26:08.234 --> 26:09.366
and it was
a bit more forced.

26:09.368 --> 26:11.835
- Phi Phi was just
stealing the scenes,

26:11.837 --> 26:12.603
whereas your character

26:12.605 --> 26:14.505
should've been the character
that stole the scene.

26:14.507 --> 26:18.342
And unfortunately, it kind of
got lost a little bit.

26:18.344 --> 26:19.843
- Up next, Katya.

26:19.845 --> 26:21.478
- Let's talk
about the runway.

26:21.480 --> 26:24.148
I didn't think the two looks
were wildly different,

26:24.150 --> 26:27.084
but I liked the humor
behind it.

26:27.086 --> 26:27.685
- Thank you.

26:27.687 --> 26:30.321
- Your conversion told a story,
and I liked that.

26:30.323 --> 26:34.358
- In your movie, I think
that you were in your head

26:34.360 --> 26:35.359
a little bit
in the beginning.

26:35.361 --> 26:38.796
- But as soon as Michelle and I
talked to you, you delivered.

26:38.798 --> 26:43.100
The scene with you and Detox
is my favorite of the three.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.569
- Up next, Detox.

26:45.571 --> 26:47.104
- As far as your scene goes,

26:47.106 --> 26:49.974
you were 100% in
from the beginning.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.609
- And it was really
collaborative.

26:51.611 --> 26:53.010
You worked well
off of each other.

26:53.012 --> 26:56.113
Let's talk about
your Ms. Peking Tuck look.

26:56.115 --> 26:59.049
When I see, like,
a two-for-one look,

26:59.051 --> 27:00.150
I want to see it, like,
you know,

27:00.152 --> 27:03.654
turn from, like, a toaster
into, like, a Nissan Sentra.

27:03.656 --> 27:05.823
So not the most
amazing transition,

27:05.825 --> 27:07.491
but I loved the end result.

27:07.493 --> 27:10.628
- All right,
Alyssa Edwards.

27:10.630 --> 27:11.629
- You needed a lot of work.

27:11.631 --> 27:13.197
I think
the biggest problem for me

27:13.199 --> 27:15.466
was your enunciation,
because nobody understood

27:15.468 --> 27:17.267
that you were saying "nurse".
- Nurse!

27:17.269 --> 27:18.302
- All we heard was Na-a-ah.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.537
- I don't care
about your diction.

27:20.539 --> 27:23.374
All you have to do is, like,
make weird, big googly eyes

27:23.376 --> 27:25.175
and do funny things
with your mouth

27:25.177 --> 27:27.011
and that mumble, aah, aah.

27:27.013 --> 27:29.847
I think your fans
got their money's worth.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.281
I think it was okay.

27:31.283 --> 27:32.716
- As far as the runway look,

27:32.718 --> 27:34.485
I don't feel like
it was a great reveal,

27:34.487 --> 27:36.053
but it didn't even matter.

27:36.055 --> 27:38.422
The cameras everywhere
was just so wacky.

27:38.424 --> 27:39.990
- Can I add
something to that?

27:39.992 --> 27:43.160
Little things in this
situation have to matter.

27:43.162 --> 27:46.063
- I don't care.
I love this look.

27:46.065 --> 27:46.897
It's funny and it's smart

27:46.899 --> 27:49.633
and I like to see stuff
like that come down the runway.

27:49.635 --> 27:50.934
- But we shouldn't
give you passes,

27:50.936 --> 27:53.370
because we've all been guilty
of going, that don't--

27:53.372 --> 27:55.105
she's so funny,
that don't even matter.

27:55.107 --> 27:56.040
No, but it does.

27:56.042 --> 27:57.474
- Thank you, Alyssa.

27:57.476 --> 28:00.344
All right, let's move
on down to Alaska,

28:00.346 --> 28:02.312
tonight on the runway
as Little Poundcake.

28:02.314 --> 28:06.817
Now, Little Poundcake was your
concoction on your season.

28:06.819 --> 28:10.421
- Lineysha Sparx and I made her
for a mini challenge.

28:10.423 --> 28:12.956
- Coming out as Little Poundcake
tonight was brilliant.

28:12.958 --> 28:14.525
You picked the right time
to do it.

28:14.527 --> 28:17.061
You looked fantastic,
and it's so fun.

28:17.063 --> 28:18.262
- The acting was so good.

28:18.264 --> 28:21.732
You were like the Dustin Hoffman
of, like, queens for acting.

28:21.734 --> 28:24.301
- You were born
to play Bette Davis.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.770
All the nuances,
the insanity,

28:26.772 --> 28:30.240
it was just
so, so brilliant.

28:30.242 --> 28:31.208
- Thank you.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.076
- Anything you want to say?

28:32.078 --> 28:35.446
- You're not my real mom
and you never will be.

28:35.448 --> 28:37.381
(all laugh)

28:37.383 --> 28:39.516
- Well, thank you, ladies.

28:39.518 --> 28:41.585
Based on your performances

28:41.587 --> 28:44.488
and your
two-in-one runway looks,

28:44.490 --> 28:46.857
I've made some decisions.

28:48.761 --> 28:52.563
Phi Phi O'Hara, Alaska,

28:52.565 --> 28:53.363
con-drag-ulations.

28:53.365 --> 28:57.201
You are the top two AllStars
of the week.

28:57.203 --> 28:59.470
(applause)

28:59.472 --> 29:05.109
You've each won $1,000
shopping spree at Fabric Planet.

29:05.111 --> 29:06.610
- Oh, fuck.

29:06.612 --> 29:08.479
I'm finally in the top two?

29:08.481 --> 29:11.048
My heart's ready to, like,
jump out of my chest

29:11.050 --> 29:13.817
because I'm so happy
right now.

29:13.819 --> 29:17.554
- Detox, you are safe.

29:17.556 --> 29:23.994
That means Roxxxy Andrews,
Katya, Alyssa Edwards...

29:24.997 --> 29:27.831
You are in the bottom three.

29:28.501 --> 29:31.001
- I'm a little upset
because I don't feel like

29:31.003 --> 29:32.703
I should be in the bottom
this week.

29:32.705 --> 29:33.804
But here I am.

29:33.806 --> 29:39.209
- Phi Phi and Alaska,
each of you needs to decide

29:39.211 --> 29:43.046
which of the bottom three
you'll eliminate

29:43.048 --> 29:45.883
if you win the lip sync.

29:45.885 --> 29:49.853
So while you queens
deliberate in the workroom,

29:49.855 --> 29:53.924
the judges and I will make
prank phone calls.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.692
(ring)

29:55.694 --> 29:58.462
You may leave the stage.

29:58.464 --> 29:59.997
Coming up...

29:59.999 --> 30:02.366
- This is Alyssa's first time
being in the bottom,

30:02.368 --> 30:03.000
but I do believe

30:03.002 --> 30:04.535
that you got the harshest
critiques out of the group.

30:04.537 --> 30:05.736
- We've only had
four challenges.

30:05.738 --> 30:06.737
You've been in the bottom
twice.

30:06.739 --> 30:09.973
- Katya and I both have
been in the bottom twice.

30:09.975 --> 30:12.442
(RuPaul laughs)

30:13.279 --> 30:16.480
(RuPaul laughs)

30:18.017 --> 30:20.951
- I feel like I should be safe
based off my performance,

30:20.953 --> 30:24.621
but I don't know if the other
girls agree with me or not.

30:24.623 --> 30:26.890
- We have this really
difficult decision

30:26.892 --> 30:28.492
that we're going to have
to be making.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.661
- Do you guys know how
you're going to do it?

30:30.663 --> 30:32.062
- I said from the get-go
I was going to do

30:32.064 --> 30:35.465
what I felt the judges
said was the weakest.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.000
But it really is close.

30:37.002 --> 30:39.503
- I mean, does anyone
who's in the bottom

30:39.505 --> 30:42.039
think that
it wasn't that close?

30:42.041 --> 30:44.942
- This is Alyssa's first time
being in the bottom,

30:44.944 --> 30:45.609
but I do believe

30:45.611 --> 30:47.511
that you got the harshest
critiques out of the group.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.780
- They did like my runway,
and they liked a lot of things

30:49.782 --> 30:50.848
about what
I was doing in it.

30:50.850 --> 30:52.216
We've only had
four challenges.

30:52.218 --> 30:53.350
You've been in the bottom
twice.

30:53.352 --> 30:54.985
- Katya and I have both
been in the bottom twice.

30:54.987 --> 30:55.853
- So that's why I don't feel

30:55.855 --> 30:58.388
that I should go home
because of one challenge.

30:58.390 --> 31:01.191
- Ooh.
- That's how I feel.

31:01.193 --> 31:04.862
- I know that normally
we do one-on-ones.

31:04.864 --> 31:09.132
In my case, I don't know
if I really need to do that.

31:09.902 --> 31:10.801
- I want to do one-on-ones

31:10.803 --> 31:14.204
with the three girls
who are in the bottom.

31:16.242 --> 31:19.142
Thank you
for coming to my office.

31:19.144 --> 31:20.978
- Do you want me to plead
my case really quick?

31:20.980 --> 31:22.379
- Yes, I do.
- All right.

31:22.381 --> 31:23.747
So I stumbled a little bit
getting warmed up

31:23.749 --> 31:25.182
in the challenge,
but then nailed it.

31:25.184 --> 31:27.351
On the runway,
I agree the transformation

31:27.353 --> 31:28.452
wasn't as dramatic
as it could've been,

31:28.454 --> 31:32.289
but I think the overall look
was different and good and fun.

31:32.291 --> 31:33.957
Okay. Thanks, mom.

31:33.959 --> 31:34.758
- Thank you, honey.

31:34.760 --> 31:37.761
Can you send in
the next model, please?

31:38.797 --> 31:40.197
Hi, honey.

31:40.199 --> 31:42.866
- (sighs)
As my partner,

31:42.868 --> 31:44.601
I don't want you to feel
like I let you down.

31:44.603 --> 31:45.302
I really did try.

31:45.304 --> 31:48.138
I took their notes
and I was full-out every time.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.740
Just, I fell short.

31:49.742 --> 31:52.509
- If not you, then who?

31:52.511 --> 31:54.244
- I definitely think
it's one of them two.

31:54.246 --> 31:55.279
They've been in the bottom.

31:55.281 --> 31:56.713
But I don't want
to pick one of them.

31:56.715 --> 31:57.915
I just want
to talk about me.

31:57.917 --> 31:59.082
I was great
in the talent show.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.918
I came prepared
for the Snatch Game.

32:00.920 --> 32:04.021
Got showed up in, you know,
the dance challenge,

32:04.023 --> 32:05.122
and I just fell short today.

32:05.124 --> 32:07.291
That's like if you were
in the bottom tomorrow.

32:07.293 --> 32:11.962
And your development,
I couldn't judge you like that.

32:11.964 --> 32:13.997
So I hope that, Alaska,

32:13.999 --> 32:17.267
you take into consideration
all of the accounts.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.836
- I will, and I have
a lot to think about.

32:19.838 --> 32:22.272
- I understand.
Thank you.

32:23.108 --> 32:23.907
- Oh.

32:23.909 --> 32:25.409
- It's a conflicting moment,

32:25.411 --> 32:26.843
so can you plead your case?

32:26.845 --> 32:31.848
- Yes. I know I wasn't as well
as Phi Phi in my challenge.

32:31.850 --> 32:33.216
Acting's not my thing,

32:33.218 --> 32:35.786
but I feel like I did well
in this challenge.

32:35.788 --> 32:39.790
And I've been in the bottom
twice and so has Katya.

32:39.792 --> 32:41.158
I don't feel like

32:41.160 --> 32:42.859
this is a challenge
I should go home for.

32:42.861 --> 32:46.063
- It's going to be
a really difficult decision.

32:46.065 --> 32:49.666
- I just want you to know that
send me home or not, I love you.

32:49.668 --> 32:51.535
I feel like I should
still stay here

32:51.537 --> 32:54.471
because I wasn't the worst,
so why send me home now?

32:54.473 --> 32:55.739
- I have a question.

32:55.741 --> 32:58.041
Do you have
that little pink thing

32:58.043 --> 33:00.510
that you wore in the video?

33:00.512 --> 33:01.044
- Yeah.

33:01.046 --> 33:03.447
- 'Cause I want to wear that
on top instead of, like...

33:03.449 --> 33:04.381
- Oh, my God, yeah.

33:04.383 --> 33:05.482
Let me
safety pin it on you.

33:05.484 --> 33:08.585
- I have a question,
though for Phifs.

33:08.587 --> 33:10.387
I feel like
when Phi Phi says

33:10.389 --> 33:11.755
that she doesn't need to do
one-on-ones,

33:11.757 --> 33:14.358
it's kind of
a little bitchy, honestly.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.926
It's like
she couldn't be bothered

33:15.928 --> 33:18.695
with having to know
what their opinions were.

33:18.697 --> 33:21.131
Usually we all
take everyone aside

33:21.133 --> 33:23.266
and, like, have our little
pow-wows and one-on-ones.

33:23.268 --> 33:25.335
What made you
come up with the decision

33:25.337 --> 33:27.771
to not do that
with these girls tonight?

33:27.773 --> 33:29.539
- I just don't want people
talking in my ear

33:29.541 --> 33:30.741
and trying to beg me
to stay.

33:30.743 --> 33:32.242
I want to just listen to Ru

33:32.244 --> 33:35.379
and go through my head
and think.

33:35.381 --> 33:37.481
- All of a sudden, like,

33:37.483 --> 33:41.918
this kind of snarky, bitchy
monster is coming out.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.420
It's definitely interesting,
especially for her saying

33:43.422 --> 33:46.957
she wants to avoid that
appearance this time around.

33:46.959 --> 33:49.092
But it looks like
she's just coming back

33:49.094 --> 33:52.896
to how she was portrayed
on season 4.

33:52.898 --> 33:54.031
(telephone rings)

33:54.033 --> 33:54.965
- (old woman) Hello?

33:54.967 --> 34:00.570
- I'm looking for Mike,
last name Hunt.

34:00.572 --> 34:04.341
Has anyone seen Mike Hunt?

34:04.343 --> 34:05.409
(all laugh)

34:05.411 --> 34:07.344
This never gets old.

34:07.346 --> 34:09.413
- Never, never.

34:09.415 --> 34:13.016
- Silence!

34:13.018 --> 34:17.554
Bring back my girls.

34:20.993 --> 34:22.692
- I feel great
about my decision.

34:22.694 --> 34:24.361
I'm constantly
just going in my head,

34:24.363 --> 34:28.532
what did the judges say,
what did the judges say?

34:28.534 --> 34:29.833
I'm sure
the queen that I chose

34:29.835 --> 34:32.669
is not going to take this
very well,

34:32.671 --> 34:35.405
but it's part of the game.

34:36.208 --> 34:38.842
- It's really hard
to contemplate

34:38.844 --> 34:42.379
the idea
of sending a friend home.

34:42.381 --> 34:43.880
I've made up my mind,

34:43.882 --> 34:48.852
but I hope
it's the right decision.

34:51.223 --> 34:53.657
(RuPaul laughs)

34:54.526 --> 34:57.327
(RuPaul laughs)

35:00.933 --> 35:02.499
- Welcome back, ladies.

35:02.501 --> 35:06.236
Two top AllStars
stand before me.

35:06.238 --> 35:13.176
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me, win $10,000,

35:13.178 --> 35:14.578
and earn the power

35:14.580 --> 35:20.484
to give one of
the bottom queens the chop.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.821
The time has come
for you to lip sync

35:24.823 --> 35:30.060
(echoing) for your legacy.

35:30.062 --> 35:30.927
- I really want to show Ru

35:30.929 --> 35:32.729
that Phi Phi's a force
to be reckoned with.

35:32.731 --> 35:37.934
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

35:37.936 --> 35:40.337
(music plays)

35:44.910 --> 35:47.944
- ¶ What you think, ah ¶

35:47.946 --> 35:49.246
¶ I think I love you, baby ¶

35:49.248 --> 35:51.982
¶ What you feel now ¶

35:51.984 --> 35:53.617
¶ I feel I need you, baby ¶

35:53.619 --> 35:55.919
¶ What you know, ah ¶

35:55.921 --> 35:59.456
¶ To be real ¶

35:59.458 --> 36:06.796
¶ Ooh, your love's
for real now ¶

36:06.798 --> 36:10.267
¶ You know that your love
is my love ¶

36:10.269 --> 36:11.868
¶ My love is your love ¶

36:11.870 --> 36:18.141
¶ Our love is here to stay,
ay, ay, ay, oh ¶

36:18.143 --> 36:21.044
¶ What you think, ah ¶

36:21.046 --> 36:22.546
¶ I think I love you, yeah ¶

36:22.548 --> 36:24.614
¶ What you feel now ¶

36:24.616 --> 36:27.050
¶ I feel I need you
to be real ¶

36:27.052 --> 36:29.119
¶ Got to be real ¶

36:29.121 --> 36:30.420
¶ Got to be real ¶

36:30.422 --> 36:31.521
¶ To be real ¶

36:31.523 --> 36:32.589
¶ Got to be real ¶

36:32.591 --> 36:34.658
¶ Got to be real ¶

36:34.660 --> 36:35.959
¶ To be real ¶

36:35.961 --> 36:38.161
¶ Real, real, real ¶

36:40.866 --> 36:44.901
- Yeah!
(cheers and applause)

36:49.074 --> 36:53.677
- Ladies, I have made
my decision.

36:56.882 --> 36:59.683
Alaska, con-drag-ulations.

36:59.685 --> 37:01.284
You're a winner, baby.

37:01.286 --> 37:06.022
You've earned a cash tip
of $10,000.

37:06.024 --> 37:06.656
- Thank you.

37:06.658 --> 37:10.060
- Phi Phi O'Hara,
you are safe.

37:10.062 --> 37:11.494
- Thank you.

37:14.066 --> 37:18.702
- Will the bottom three
please step forward?

37:20.739 --> 37:27.143
Alaska, with great power
comes great responsibility.

37:27.646 --> 37:32.816
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

37:32.818 --> 37:36.286
- As it gets
fewer and fewer,

37:36.288 --> 37:38.521
it gets
more and more difficult.

37:38.523 --> 37:41.324
And so
I hope that this queen,

37:41.326 --> 37:43.460
who I consider
to be my sister,

37:43.462 --> 37:48.431
will understand the decision
that I've made tonight.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.533
So the queen
I've selected...

37:52.738 --> 37:55.405
is Alyssa Edwards.

37:55.407 --> 37:58.008
(sobs)

37:58.010 --> 38:00.844
I'm so sorry.

38:05.951 --> 38:09.152
- Alyssa Edwards,
as it is written,

38:09.154 --> 38:11.321
so it shall be done.

38:11.323 --> 38:14.291
You are an AllStar

38:14.293 --> 38:17.827
always and forever.

38:17.829 --> 38:18.628
- Thank you.

38:18.630 --> 38:21.665
- Now, sashay away.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.600
- I'm so sorry.
I love you so much.

38:23.602 --> 38:24.768
- Don't be sorry, girl.

38:24.770 --> 38:28.805
Well, I was a lovely
fifth alternate.

38:28.807 --> 38:32.409
(all laugh)

38:32.411 --> 38:36.913
Always and forever,
Alyssa Edwards.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.420
I'm going to take
my own advice.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.322
Winning isn't everything,
but wanting to is.

38:45.324 --> 38:48.191
There are so many people that
want to be in this competition,

38:48.193 --> 38:50.527
and I'm
one of the lucky ones.

38:50.529 --> 38:53.396
A true champion
isn't the one

38:53.398 --> 38:56.099
that necessarily
leaves with a trophy.

38:56.101 --> 38:57.834
(alarm)

38:57.836 --> 39:01.938
- Alyssa, it ain't over.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.808
Con-drag-ulations, AllStars.

39:04.810 --> 39:07.644
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,

39:07.646 --> 39:13.450
(muffled) how the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

39:19.791 --> 39:24.961
- "It's not personell,
it's drag.

39:24.963 --> 39:26.963
P.S. log off."

39:26.965 --> 39:27.797
Aw.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.099
- Alyssa
was just eliminated,

39:29.101 --> 39:33.770
and it feels like a giant chunk
of the Drag Race tapestry

39:33.772 --> 39:35.538
was just burned out.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.674
- I feel like I sent

39:37.676 --> 39:40.744
my really good Judy
away from here,

39:40.746 --> 39:43.446
and I feel like shit
about that.

39:43.448 --> 39:45.148
- So who did you choose?

39:45.150 --> 39:48.351
- I also agreed.
It was Alyssa.

39:48.353 --> 39:49.786
And can I be
completely honest?

39:49.788 --> 39:53.790
I am sick of hearing them say
you can wear shit on stage,

39:53.792 --> 39:55.458
but it's okay
'cause you're Alyssa.

39:55.460 --> 39:58.762
It really bothered me
and I just kind of felt like

39:58.764 --> 40:00.897
it's not fair that the judges
just let her slide.

40:00.899 --> 40:03.767
If that was me,
I'd get my ass served to me.

40:03.769 --> 40:04.401
It was sloppy.

40:04.403 --> 40:06.436
I think that concept
was cool, but it was sloppy.

40:06.438 --> 40:08.805
And if any of us did that,
we would get read for filth.

40:08.807 --> 40:12.008
It was like she kept saying,
like, you shouldn't send me home

40:12.010 --> 40:14.344
because I've only been
in the bottom once.

40:14.346 --> 40:15.178
And she was too concerned

40:15.180 --> 40:16.579
about saying this is your
second time in the bottom,

40:16.581 --> 40:17.380
you should go home.

40:17.382 --> 40:21.084
What even, like, made that
decision even easier for me

40:21.086 --> 40:23.553
is it seemed to me
she was more concerned

40:23.555 --> 40:27.624
about throwing you two under
the bus during deliberation.

40:30.128 --> 40:32.862
- What? Oh, my God!

40:32.864 --> 40:34.164
- Oh, fuck! My God.

40:34.166 --> 40:36.132
- What is going on here?

40:36.134 --> 40:37.734
- Boom!

40:37.736 --> 40:40.069
- Face crack
of the millennium.

40:40.071 --> 40:43.239
All of the eliminated girls
are standing behind the mirror.

40:43.241 --> 40:46.676
They look mad.
They look really mad.

40:46.678 --> 40:48.645
- What the fuck?

40:48.647 --> 40:52.081
- Oh, shit.
There's Alyssa Edwards.

40:52.083 --> 40:52.849
I'm surprised the bitch

40:52.851 --> 40:54.818
hasn't dove through
the fuckin mirror yet.

40:54.820 --> 40:57.987
- Trust the duchess
when she says this.

40:57.989 --> 41:00.290
Y'all thought you all
had packed me?

41:00.292 --> 41:02.926
It ain't over
just yet, baby.
