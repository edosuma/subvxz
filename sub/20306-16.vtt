NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues<i>...</i>

00:03.253 --> 00:07.716
The Melon Felon, he's still out there.
We got five heads and three bodies.

00:07.799 --> 00:09.134
Why did you come to this lot?

00:09.676 --> 00:12.846
Well, I was interested
in buying a mobile home.

00:12.929 --> 00:14.222
Is that our decoy?

00:14.305 --> 00:17.642
-Right, sir, Detective Mayo.
-Great set of wheels, huh?

00:17.726 --> 00:19.060
How's that little snip of a girl?

00:19.144 --> 00:20.687
-You mean Robin Tataglia?
-Yeah.

00:20.770 --> 00:24.441
It's over with us. It's finished.
In addition, I'm being evicted.

00:24.524 --> 00:27.068
We'll take every one of your complaints,
fix it like new,

00:27.152 --> 00:30.071
and have you back
in your new home by the end of the day.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.991
-(phone clatters)
-What?

00:33.867 --> 00:35.952
Daniels just asked me out
for dinner next week.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.328
Good news, Detective.

00:37.412 --> 00:41.791
How does one bedroom, virtually rent-free,
with a shower massage sound?

00:41.875 --> 00:43.501
They fix your motor home, Lieutenant?

00:43.585 --> 00:45.545
I am not looking forward to this date!

00:45.628 --> 00:46.671
Pats, what could be bad?

00:46.755 --> 00:49.049
Daniels buys you a nice dinner,
you show him a little leg,

00:49.132 --> 00:50.800
and then he drops you home.

00:50.884 --> 00:54.054
Two out of three, Harry.
I am not showing him a little leg.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.555
You're a damn sexy woman.

00:55.638 --> 00:57.307
You make me feel young again...

00:57.682 --> 00:58.933
in touch with myself...

00:59.559 --> 01:02.645
connected to my long-dormant sensual side.

01:04.105 --> 01:06.608
-(indistinct conversations)
-PHIL:<i> Item three,</i>

01:08.026 --> 01:11.905
a headless female torso was discovered
behind Glachevski's Market,

01:11.988 --> 01:14.282
3:00 a.m. this morning, 104 and Dekker.

01:14.365 --> 01:17.869
-Good morning, ladies.
-And that brings the torso total to seven.

01:17.952 --> 01:20.205
Craniums remain at five.

01:20.288 --> 01:24.334
Answering which,
Operation Decap begins today

01:24.417 --> 01:27.087
on the Hill, Polk Avenue, and the Ferry.

01:27.170 --> 01:30.298
These are the three precincts
that this maniac has hit.

01:30.799 --> 01:34.886
Female officers Dennison, Barber, White,
Vershile, Brenner, and Diehl

01:34.969 --> 01:37.472
are on loan from the Heights and Midtown.

01:37.555 --> 01:42.560
Now, along with Mayo and Sergeant Bates,
they're gonna be on the street as bait.

01:42.852 --> 01:46.815
Each has an N.D. backup.
Lieutenant Goldblume is coordinating.

01:47.607 --> 01:50.235
STAN: Forensics has this guy
using a carpet knife

01:50.318 --> 01:53.363
-to decapitate his victims which are all--
-(groaning)

01:53.446 --> 01:57.075
All female, different races, all hookers.

01:57.158 --> 01:58.576
No description,

01:58.660 --> 02:02.497
no consistent M.O.
except for the targets of the assaults.

02:02.580 --> 02:03.498
Let's, uh...

02:04.707 --> 02:06.042
Let's catch him, folks.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.711
Incidentally, um,

02:09.337 --> 02:13.675
Officer Coffey and Hudson
and Detective Garibaldi

02:13.758 --> 02:17.887
will be on loan exchange to the Heights
for the duration of Operation Decap.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.180
Item four,

02:19.597 --> 02:25.186
uh, four continues the undercover
against the on-the-take city inspectors.

02:25.270 --> 02:28.022
Detectives Belker, LaRue, and Washington

02:28.106 --> 02:31.442
will be working with Lieutenant Mel Taber
from Polk Avenue.

02:31.526 --> 02:35.321
They're gonna be at the Chuckwagon,
126 and Lexington.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.907
Hey, how many inspectors
you got left to take, people?

02:37.991 --> 02:39.951
The Department of Health guy, Sarge.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.164
Anybody swing on Detective Taber yet?

02:44.247 --> 02:45.498
(indistinct talking)

02:45.582 --> 02:47.584
I'll tell ya, we're sendin' him
to Dale Carnegie

02:47.667 --> 02:49.419
after the operation, Sarge.

02:50.461 --> 02:51.421
Item five,

02:52.338 --> 02:55.675
ah, item five is a memo

02:55.758 --> 03:00.305
from our friend, Mr. Albert Desjardins,
from Division Accounting.

03:00.388 --> 03:02.432
Now, we got this the end
of business yesterday.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.267
They're tightenin' the belt again, people.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.310
(booing)

03:05.393 --> 03:06.644
STAN: Yeah, you got it.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.271
"Beginning immediately,

03:08.354 --> 03:12.442
"officers are required
to provide accurate telephone logs

03:12.525 --> 03:15.737
"and to pay the department for toll calls,

03:15.820 --> 03:20.909
long distance or local,
which are not job-related."

03:20.992 --> 03:24.120
(indistinct shouting)

03:24.579 --> 03:28.958
Also, we got, uh, printouts
of the last three months

03:29.042 --> 03:32.962
of precinct billings,
which will be posted, uh...

03:34.172 --> 03:35.506
Uh, check the list.

03:36.174 --> 03:38.343
Ante up to Division. That's what they say.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.013
Two, damage to units,

03:42.096 --> 03:45.850
beginning today, Division
will evaluate all accident reports.

03:45.934 --> 03:49.103
If an officer is deemed negligent
in his vehicle's operation,

03:49.187 --> 03:51.773
that officer will be held
financially responsible

03:52.106 --> 03:53.858
for vehicular repairs.

03:53.942 --> 03:57.320
So you bring money and a tire iron
to work with you, right?

03:57.403 --> 03:59.864
(indistinct shouting)

03:59.948 --> 04:02.533
Item six, I don't want
to embarrass anybody,

04:02.617 --> 04:07.121
but, uh, I happen to know
that we have a birthday boy today.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.333
Who... who shall remain nameless.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.417
-Oh, come on!
-Come on!

04:11.501 --> 04:12.543
Last...

04:14.879 --> 04:19.050
Tonight, the Hill Street Keglers
open the season against Midtown.

04:19.133 --> 04:22.095
(cheering)

04:22.178 --> 04:24.097
We looked damned good in practice, people.

04:24.180 --> 04:28.393
I think that we might make a run
at the championship this year.

04:28.476 --> 04:32.272
Anybody feel like it, come on down,
lend some moral support.

04:32.355 --> 04:36.109
The first frame rolls,
the Bowl-More Lanes, 6:30 p.m.

04:36.192 --> 04:38.695
Let's do it to them
before they do it to us!

04:38.778 --> 04:42.073
(indistinct conversations)

04:49.080 --> 04:51.416
Natalie, get me a couple
of videotapes, would you?

04:51.499 --> 04:54.961
All the chickens coming home to roost.

04:56.629 --> 04:59.299
Is this the idiot printout
of precinct phone calls?

04:59.382 --> 05:00.216
Yes, sir.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.179
Neal, is Belker down there?

05:05.263 --> 05:07.223
He was gonna drive to the undercover
by himself, Lieutenant.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.600
-Oh, rats!
-Any message?

05:09.684 --> 05:12.145
Uh, thanks, no.
Maybe I'll catch him at lunch.

05:12.228 --> 05:13.062
Morning, John.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.773
Hey, do I understand that
you are moonlighting on a movie set?

05:15.857 --> 05:18.026
Would you hold the decibel level down
just a hair, huh?

05:18.109 --> 05:21.863
Okay, mum's the word.
You meet anybody famous?

05:21.946 --> 05:24.282
Lieutenant, we're talking
a low-budget horror film here.

05:24.365 --> 05:27.368
It's not exactly like you're gonna see
marquee names.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.538
F-U-R-I-L-L-O, yes.

05:30.621 --> 05:34.917
You tell Mr. Desjardins that his
directives on phone-call reimbursements

05:35.001 --> 05:37.754
are about the stupidest
I've seen in my years on the force.

05:37.837 --> 05:40.173
They're unenforceable
and they'll break morale.

05:40.631 --> 05:41.966
Yeah, they're unenforc--

05:42.550 --> 05:43.926
Look, just tell Mr. Desjardins

05:44.010 --> 05:46.512
that if he has the guts to come out
from behind his printouts,

05:46.596 --> 05:49.474
I want to talk to him,
or he can come down here to the precinct.

05:49.557 --> 05:50.850
I'll be here till very late.

05:51.267 --> 05:52.935
Yes. Thank you.

05:53.978 --> 05:54.854
(clears throat)

05:57.190 --> 05:59.442
Did you see the directives
from Division Accounting?

05:59.525 --> 06:00.735
Yeah, they're nuts.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.280
Captain, could we talk a minute
about Operation Decap?

06:04.364 --> 06:06.240
-MAN: Height's the problem.
-Sure.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.701
Um, I'm concerned
about the follow-up procedures

06:08.785 --> 06:11.204
if the undercover
have to go indoors with this guy.

06:11.662 --> 06:14.582
We really ought to have cops
pre-deployed in the hotels.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.876
Patsy, our manpower is finite.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.796
Five out of seven of those attacks
took place out on the street.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.506
It's how we decided to go.

06:22.673 --> 06:25.051
I'd like not to go out
on this assignment, sir.

06:26.052 --> 06:29.430
I'll ride backup,
but I don't want to go out as bait.

06:29.847 --> 06:32.558
I have to tell you that given
the inherent danger in the operation,

06:32.642 --> 06:34.769
I think it's been sensibly laid out.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.564
The guy scares the hell out of me.

06:39.232 --> 06:43.611
A frightened cop can endanger
an entire operation.

06:44.487 --> 06:45.613
You ride backup today.

06:47.198 --> 06:48.282
Thanks, Captain.

06:49.033 --> 06:52.245
You performed too bravely
in too many dangerous situations

06:52.328 --> 06:53.579
not to have this one coming.

06:55.039 --> 06:55.957
Thank you, sir.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.459
Hey, what the hell's the big hang-up?

06:58.543 --> 07:01.212
We're gettin' our equipment together,
Lieutenant Taber, sir.

07:01.295 --> 07:03.923
(groans) Well, if Furillo
had more than half a brain,

07:04.006 --> 07:06.300
we wouldn't be taking
this stuff down every afternoon

07:06.384 --> 07:07.969
and setting it back up again every--

07:08.052 --> 07:10.555
The Captain didn't think the night guy
at the restaurant could be trusted.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.516
Oh, yeah, the night guy, he looks like
a regular Dillinger, doesn't he?

07:13.975 --> 07:16.102
-Mel definitely needs his first drink.
-(chuckles)

07:16.185 --> 07:18.729
Yeah? And he's gonna feel better
when he gets it, too.

07:18.813 --> 07:21.232
That's more than we can say
for<i> your </i>problem, Washington.

07:21.315 --> 07:23.359
Hey, why don't you take it easy, Taber?

07:23.943 --> 07:28.072
Whole damn department
getting drowned in broads and spades!

07:28.156 --> 07:29.449
What did you say, Taber?

07:30.533 --> 07:33.536
Nothing, Captain, just having
a few problems with this operation.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.329
Good. Sit on 'em.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.039
And if I hear another
racist crack out of you,

07:37.123 --> 07:39.125
I'm gonna run your butt
back to school patrol.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.418
Get back to work.

07:42.378 --> 07:44.881
-Big man. Big shot.
-Turn around and say it!

07:49.594 --> 07:52.305
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

07:52.388 --> 07:54.140
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

07:54.223 --> 07:57.977
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

07:58.060 --> 07:59.770
(sirens wailing)

08:05.234 --> 08:07.862
(theme music playing)

09:07.338 --> 09:10.299
(siren wailing)

09:29.485 --> 09:32.196
(indistinct conversations)

09:41.872 --> 09:42.790
MAN:<i> Yo, chica.</i>

09:43.291 --> 09:45.167
BATES:<i> Yo, yourself. Lookin' to boogie?</i>

09:47.003 --> 09:48.004
<i>Me and my money. Get in.</i>

09:59.765 --> 10:02.059
-(sighs)
-I've not seen you on this block before.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.146
(engine starts)

10:08.357 --> 10:12.486
N.D. 7 on Coral and 114.
I'm gonna circle the block.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.196
BATES:<i> Now what?</i>

10:14.739 --> 10:17.116
-What's doin'?
-Let me see if we got company.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.244
What's the problem?
What do you mean, company?

10:20.703 --> 10:23.456
Don't you got nobody who turns you out?

10:24.206 --> 10:25.833
Nobody to look after you?

10:25.916 --> 10:28.878
I do real well lookin'
after myself, thanks.

10:30.212 --> 10:31.339
Ah,<i> chica...</i>

10:32.632 --> 10:34.634
but you ain't doin' good enough.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.553
What's... what's with the knife?

10:37.845 --> 10:39.972
<i>Don't you know these streets</i>
<i>ain't too safe?</i>

10:40.389 --> 10:41.682
There's a guy out here...

10:42.933 --> 10:44.268
cutting ladies.

10:44.518 --> 10:45.353
Is that you?

10:45.728 --> 10:47.438
I'm a serious man,<i> chica.</i>

10:48.230 --> 10:49.106
Is that right?

10:49.982 --> 10:52.443
But I'm not gonna cut you
because I'm<i> loco</i>.

10:53.444 --> 10:57.615
-I'm gonna cut you for being<i> solo...</i>
-(vehicle approaches)

10:57.698 --> 10:58.908
...on<i> my </i>street.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.201
(tires screech)

11:00.826 --> 11:03.204
-That's it, you're busted!
-What's going on?

11:03.287 --> 11:06.290
-I'm a cop! You're under arrest!
-Get out of the car and spread 'em!

11:06.374 --> 11:07.541
-Stay cool.
-You stay cool!

11:07.625 --> 11:10.044
-Stay calm, ladies.
-You stay calm! Get out!

11:17.718 --> 11:19.095
How you doin, Si?

11:19.178 --> 11:22.890
I'm in mourning. I just heard my favorite
restaurant's gettin' sold.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.934
I want you to meet Neal Harrison.
Neal bought me out.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.687
-Simon Meyers, Neal, Department of Health.
-Hey, how you doin'?

11:27.770 --> 11:29.230
-Pleasure, Neal.
-I've made Neal familiar

11:29.313 --> 11:32.733
with my entire operation,<i> everything</i>
with the way I've done business.

11:32.817 --> 11:33.651
Good.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.486
Just want to keep things goin'
on the way George did, sir.

11:35.569 --> 11:38.447
If it ain't busted, Neal, don't fix it.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.907
-Am I correct?
-Yeah, right.

11:39.990 --> 11:42.326
Let's have a look at your storage,
see how you stand.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.456
-(door closes)
-Well...

11:48.249 --> 11:50.334
Maybe Taber gets to go home
for lunch today, huh?

11:50.418 --> 11:51.961
Maybe everyone does.

11:52.044 --> 11:55.589
<i>Oh, you got</i>
<i>possible rodent leavings here, Neal.</i>

11:56.173 --> 11:58.634
Tell you one thing I'm<i> not </i>workin' on
is that head cutter.

11:58.718 --> 12:02.096
I had one of those crazies
my first shot out after I made clothes.

12:02.930 --> 12:05.182
Guy kept his mother's head in a soup bowl.

12:05.516 --> 12:06.809
I nearly quit the force.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.103
<i>Makin' sure that I pass</i>
<i>my health inspections.</i>

12:09.478 --> 12:11.355
<i>Well, no one wants to see</i>
<i>you in violation.</i>

12:11.439 --> 12:14.984
Hey. Hey. All right. Come on, come on.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.278
<i>George here said that if I paid you--</i>

12:17.361 --> 12:20.614
(garbled talking)

12:21.615 --> 12:22.867
Oh, man! Uh-oh!

12:23.451 --> 12:24.326
Are you kidding?

12:25.119 --> 12:26.245
Are you kidding me?

12:27.246 --> 12:29.123
-(banging)
-What is the problem?

12:29.206 --> 12:30.249
Hey, I'm workin' on it.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.627
I can't believe it! I cannot believe it!

12:37.715 --> 12:41.343
He blew it! The last guy we gotta get,
and your buddy screws up the tape!

12:41.427 --> 12:43.679
-Keep your voice down.
-I'm gonna spend the rest of my life here!

12:43.763 --> 12:45.181
I'm gonna die here!

12:46.432 --> 12:50.603
Neal, this is what we call
an approval with a caution.

12:50.686 --> 12:53.606
-Now, that's on account of the leavings.
-I'll stay on top of it, sir.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.357
Don't do that,
it'll make your clothes stink.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.817
(laughs)

12:56.901 --> 12:59.528
Neal, I'm glad we met.
I'm glad there's continuity.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.906
Well, my pleasure, sir.
How we doin', fellas?

13:01.989 --> 13:04.700
We couldn't get the dishes done,
Mr. Harrison.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.953
-The washer's on the fritz.
-Equipment problem?

13:08.037 --> 13:10.164
-Yeah.
-George, drop me a postcard.

13:10.247 --> 13:12.041
-Will do.
-See you on the 15th, Neal.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.167
Yeah, right, 15th.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.004
What happened? Why couldn't we bust him?

13:17.087 --> 13:19.548
Marconi screwed up.
We didn't get the bribe on tape!

13:19.632 --> 13:22.009
The cord came loose, Mel.
It happens, you know?

13:22.092 --> 13:23.511
All right, we gotta get Meyers back.

13:23.594 --> 13:25.429
GEORGE: This is no good!
You guys said you'd be done today!

13:25.513 --> 13:28.349
Bunch of amateurs, a spook and two losers!

13:28.974 --> 13:30.893
J.D., I'm gonna have
to pop this fat bastard!

13:30.976 --> 13:33.187
Let it go, Neal. I got Mel covered.

13:33.270 --> 13:35.648
Listen, we gotta get back in touch
with the guy.

13:35.731 --> 13:37.983
It's up to you.
You think you can handle a phone call?

13:38.067 --> 13:40.903
Trust me. Trust me, okay? Scout's honor.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.989
I really don't know how
you got to be this old, Lieutenant.

13:50.704 --> 13:52.498
What'd the PBA tell you?

13:52.581 --> 13:55.626
Put it on the grievance list,
talk about it at next month's meeting.

13:56.293 --> 13:59.296
Frankly, I put about as much store
in the protective benevolent association

13:59.380 --> 14:01.632
as I do in that police accountant,
Mr. Desj--

14:01.715 --> 14:03.050
-Desjardins.
-De Janeiro.

14:03.133 --> 14:06.428
-Desjardins. Do you see that guy?
-WOMAN: Hey, stop! Somebody...

14:06.512 --> 14:09.473
Now, surely he must see our unit.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.393
-I'll get him.
-(horn honks)

14:15.729 --> 14:17.648
-(tires screech)
-WOMAN: Did you see that guy?

14:17.731 --> 14:20.818
-(indistinct conversations)
-You okay?

14:20.901 --> 14:21.944
Yes!

14:22.528 --> 14:25.865
(indistinct conversations)

14:27.074 --> 14:30.035
-Will you stop it?!
-I made a mistake! Let me up!

14:30.119 --> 14:32.580
Rodriguez, you want to try to stick this
in my face again?

14:32.663 --> 14:33.706
You try it!

14:36.917 --> 14:39.753
Hear we made a pop at the red-zone
undercover, Sergeant.

14:39.837 --> 14:42.423
-Yes, sir.
-Is it possible he's our killer?

14:43.173 --> 14:46.385
We're gonna question him, but I think
he's just a pimp with a loud mouth!

14:46.719 --> 14:47.970
Well done, anyway.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.057
-Detective.
-Chief.

14:52.892 --> 14:56.604
-How's the iron maiden this morning?
-Okay.

15:01.066 --> 15:01.901
Tag it, Leo.

15:03.152 --> 15:07.281
Detective Mayo, I see you're listed
in the follow car for the undercover.

15:07.364 --> 15:09.617
-Yes, sir.
-Why aren't you out on the street?

15:09.700 --> 15:11.160
I changed Mayo's assignment, Chief.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.997
That's a fascinating allocation
of manpower, Captain,

15:15.080 --> 15:17.583
transfer 14 female cops
from other precincts

15:17.666 --> 15:19.335
and Mayo gets to ride in a follow car.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.045
It was at my request, sir.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.172
-FURILLO: Chief, if we could discuss--
<i>-Your </i>request?

15:23.255 --> 15:24.924
Yes, sir, I asked to be reassigned.

15:25.257 --> 15:28.177
-Did you ask for any warm milk, Detective?
-No!

15:28.260 --> 15:31.347
I want you out on the street,
Detective Mayo, dressed like a whore!

15:31.430 --> 15:34.516
Detective Mayo has questioning
and paperwork to do on this arrest.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.144
Bates can write up the collar.
She was brave enough to make it.

15:37.227 --> 15:39.313
Out on the street, Detective!
That's an order!

15:39.396 --> 15:41.482
Sir, I don't feel this operation is safe.

15:41.565 --> 15:44.860
Insubordinate refusal of a direct order,
you're suspended!

15:45.736 --> 15:48.238
-I don't believe you.
-Believe me.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.283
You don't have to suspend me. Here!

15:53.953 --> 15:55.454
Here, Captain. Give these to someone who--

15:55.537 --> 15:57.665
-Chief...
-The hell with her, Frank!

15:58.207 --> 16:00.751
The woman's a coward,
and she's personally abusive to boot

16:00.834 --> 16:02.169
trying to ridicule me that way!

16:02.252 --> 16:04.505
-I didn't hear any ridicule.
-Then you weren't listening!

16:04.588 --> 16:07.174
Frank, she's quit.
That's it. We're the better for it.

16:07.508 --> 16:08.884
Can I ask you to take a day?

16:08.968 --> 16:10.970
I'll come to your office,
and we can work out--

16:11.053 --> 16:13.138
Don't manage me, Furillo.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.307
The hell with Mayo! Case closed!

16:16.350 --> 16:18.143
Keep me posted on the operation.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.279
Patsy...

16:30.739 --> 16:31.949
I'm out of here, Captain.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.993
Calm down and tell me
what's going on, huh?

16:34.076 --> 16:35.077
What's going on?

16:35.160 --> 16:38.163
He couldn't make it with me last night,
so he calls me out in the stationhouse!

16:38.247 --> 16:40.666
He calls me a coward
in front of everyone I work with!

16:40.749 --> 16:41.750
Back up.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.503
You had a date with Chief Daniels?

16:44.920 --> 16:47.464
He kept asking,
I didn't know how to get out of it.

16:48.090 --> 16:51.218
We had dinner. I tried to shut him down
politely, but no way!

16:54.013 --> 16:55.014
He made a pass at you?

16:55.514 --> 16:57.725
(deep voice)
"You're so damned attractive, Patsy.

16:57.808 --> 17:01.311
I'm so lonely, Patsy.
Damn it if I can't help myself."

17:01.979 --> 17:04.273
(normal voice)
I felt sorry for the guy, Captain.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.026
He's just separated. He's all freaked out.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.360
But he wouldn't take the hint,

17:08.444 --> 17:11.155
so I stopped hinting,
and now he pulls this!

17:11.238 --> 17:13.741
Take back the hardware, Patsy.
Let me try to work it out.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.911
I shouldn't need you to run interference
so I can function as a cop!

17:18.829 --> 17:21.373
Look, this is a ticklish situation
on both sides.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.792
I mean, you were bordering
on refusing an order,

17:23.876 --> 17:25.836
and he may have been guilty of harassment.

17:26.754 --> 17:29.965
Maybe I ought to bring charges
and let the review board sort it out.

17:30.466 --> 17:31.467
Is that what you want?

17:36.013 --> 17:38.223
I want to be treated like a human being...

17:38.807 --> 17:40.684
and I want to do my job.

17:41.685 --> 17:43.353
I mean, maybe with this morning,
you doubt it.

17:43.437 --> 17:46.148
If that's what you really want,
you'll go back on assignment.

17:46.774 --> 17:47.941
I'm suspended.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.485
You let me worry about that.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.658
This<i> isn't </i>one I had coming.

17:57.284 --> 17:58.494
This one's on the house.

18:18.013 --> 18:19.932
Notice anything different about me, Leo?

18:20.015 --> 18:22.976
You're losing weight, Mrs. Furillo.
You look great. Excuse me.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.144
-No, that's--
-Fay.

18:24.228 --> 18:27.106
Frank, notice anything different?

18:27.189 --> 18:28.690
I can't talk now, Fay.

18:30.651 --> 18:31.735
Officers...

18:32.528 --> 18:33.570
Yes, ma'am.

18:34.154 --> 18:38.826
Sergeant, allow me to present the remains
of the passenger door of my vehicle.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.410
What happened?

18:40.494 --> 18:42.454
Well, Sarge, made a sudden stop
to go after a purse snatcher.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.747
Uh, we didn't have the bubble.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.249
Sir, and then I was about to get out,

18:45.332 --> 18:47.668
and a man came along
by the name of Lorenzo Somers

18:47.751 --> 18:49.169
-and sheared that thing off...
-Sliced it!

18:49.253 --> 18:50.796
...slicker than a mink's privates.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.005
Sign out another unit.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.883
Sarge, I don't want you to think
that I'm a gross abuser of--

18:54.967 --> 18:56.426
(overlapping dialogues)

18:56.510 --> 18:58.512
Andy, stop with the martyr routine.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.264
Sir, I do not feel that my partner and I

19:00.347 --> 19:03.058
should do eight kabillion reams
of paperwork because--

19:03.142 --> 19:05.686
Andy, this is the beginning
of the bowling league.

19:05.769 --> 19:09.273
Nothing's gonna spoil my good humor.
Sign out another unit. Shut up.

19:09.356 --> 19:10.399
Cool!

19:11.608 --> 19:13.110
Unit 2202.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.160
Rodriguez made a mistake.

19:22.077 --> 19:25.205
Rodriguez popped his mouth off
and he's sorry.

19:26.373 --> 19:28.000
Man, I thought you was working.

19:28.083 --> 19:31.253
-I was looking to impress you.
-You impressed the hell out of me.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.299
I made a mistake.
I'm telling you what's on my mind.

19:35.632 --> 19:37.593
What do you know
about these killings, Tommy?

19:38.260 --> 19:41.889
Believe me, if we knew something,
so would you.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.349
This<i> loco </i>is scaring away trade.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.602
He's making the girls crazy.

19:47.144 --> 19:50.439
It's possible that I lost a chick myself.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.567
I might have a chick
working for me right now,

19:53.650 --> 19:55.485
but this<i> loco </i>cut her head off.

19:56.445 --> 19:59.156
-He killed one of your girls?
-Possibly, yeah.

20:00.365 --> 20:01.450
But you didn't see him?

20:01.825 --> 20:03.827
Man, you can't be everyplace at one time.

20:05.037 --> 20:05.954
No.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.043
You're busted for assaulting a cop.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.004
-Busted?
-That's right, Rodriguez.

20:14.588 --> 20:17.466
-Who's gonna take care of my girls?
-Anybody better than you.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.344
See, that's because you've never taken
the treatment.

20:23.847 --> 20:27.643
I am<i> sorry, </i>Tommy. Forgive me.

20:30.896 --> 20:34.233
-I'm trolling for a compliment, Henry.
-Uh...

20:34.691 --> 20:36.276
Hot blouse, Fay. Just get it?

20:36.985 --> 20:40.405
No! I was wearing this blouse
the first time we ever went out, you jerk!

20:41.448 --> 20:43.992
That's a long way to go
to take a cheap shot, Fay.

20:48.705 --> 20:52.501
Alice, hey, you are a sweetheart.
This is for your trouble.

20:52.584 --> 20:55.420
No damage when you bring this back, J.D.
Okay? I'll lose my job.

20:55.504 --> 20:58.590
Hey, trust me, okay?
I'm gonna treat this like it was my own.

20:58.674 --> 21:01.009
Try to dress better
when you say somethin' like that.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.094
I'll be honest with you, Neal.

21:02.177 --> 21:04.054
I don't care much for emergency calls.

21:04.137 --> 21:06.473
-I promise this'll just take a second.
-What's our problem?

21:06.556 --> 21:10.602
Neal had a concern he wanted to discuss
with you. He's concerned with...

21:11.270 --> 21:12.521
Mick, Mick...

21:14.022 --> 21:16.441
what's the ugliest thing you ever saw?

21:16.525 --> 21:20.195
(screams, groans) What the hell is that?

21:20.279 --> 21:22.531
It's from that movie I'm doin,
<i>Hacksaws from Hell</i>.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.908
(groans) What's it for?

21:24.992 --> 21:26.910
(chuckles)

21:31.748 --> 21:33.458
<i>Think we ought to tighten him up, too?</i>

21:34.042 --> 21:38.005
<i>Neal, if I tell you I need $40 twice...</i>

21:38.088 --> 21:41.049
Don't look in the box.
Get away from the box.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.718
What box?

21:43.677 --> 21:46.346
The owner's got six dozen t-bones
in that box on the shelf.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.223
I, uh, borrowed a dozen before.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.142
SIMON:<i> Then this is throwing</i>
<i>the money away.</i>

21:50.225 --> 21:53.228
-You better go back and get some more.
-What do you mean?

21:53.312 --> 21:55.439
-I'm in for some steaks, too!
-Hey, come on, Taber!

21:55.522 --> 21:59.609
-Otherwise, the owner might find out.
-Yeah. Yeah.

21:59.693 --> 22:03.280
<i>If you want to give me a double sawbuck,</i>
<i>this is between you and your conscience.</i>

22:04.239 --> 22:05.699
<i>Well, I'd like to do it.</i>

22:05.782 --> 22:07.784
<i>-This is up to you.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

22:08.452 --> 22:10.829
-Bingo. Look at this.
-Pop 'em when they come out.

22:10.912 --> 22:13.457
-Where you gonna be?
-In the freezer.

22:13.540 --> 22:15.500
-SIMON:<i> Neal, call me Si.</i>
-Oh, yeah?

22:15.584 --> 22:17.794
-NEAL:<i> All right.</i>
-You know something, LaRue?

22:17.878 --> 22:20.547
Lose that shine partner of yours,
you could be a citizen.

22:24.384 --> 22:25.552
Gotcha!

22:26.470 --> 22:27.846
Mick, we're gonna bust him.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.396
-Pleasure doin' business, Neal.
-Yeah.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.566
-You're under arrest, dog breath.
-What? Are you kiddin' me?

22:39.649 --> 22:41.401
Does it look like we're kidding,
butt face?

22:41.485 --> 22:43.487
-Grab the counter.
-We're police officers, Mr. Meyers.

22:43.570 --> 22:46.323
You're under arrest for solicitation
and acceptance of a bribe.

22:46.406 --> 22:50.118
-I don't believe this. You set me up!
-They had me, three counts of receiving!

22:50.202 --> 22:51.995
You people ought
to be ashamed of yourselves!

22:52.079 --> 22:54.039
-Shut up!
-Take 'em to the station.

22:54.122 --> 22:57.751
-Let's go!
-(indistinct shouting)

22:57.834 --> 22:59.961
-Move!
-Hey, what's up? What's goin' on?

23:00.045 --> 23:03.048
Stick it in your ear, Mel.
You want steaks, you steal 'em yourself.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.467
Where you goin', Mel?

23:05.550 --> 23:07.386
-BELKER: What are you guys doing?
-I forgot something!

23:07.469 --> 23:10.222
Hey, go ahead, Mick.
We'll lock up here and be along in a few.

23:16.895 --> 23:19.815
(humming)

23:21.066 --> 23:22.275
What'd you do, J.D.?

23:22.776 --> 23:24.861
A little payback for "Melski."

23:24.945 --> 23:27.572
I got a rubber head
from that prop girl on that movie set.

23:28.115 --> 23:29.199
I just planted it in there.

23:29.282 --> 23:31.701
I can hardly wait to see
the expression on this jerk's face.

23:31.785 --> 23:33.912
(laughs) All right!

23:36.957 --> 23:38.792
Mel's a little late for his cue.

23:40.168 --> 23:41.670
-J.D...
-What?

23:43.255 --> 23:44.131
Is that a hand?

23:56.017 --> 23:58.895
-Oh, no. Oh, no!
-Oh, man! Heart attack!

23:58.979 --> 24:01.815
-Stroke, somethin'.
-I'll call an ambulance.

24:03.859 --> 24:04.943
Call two.

24:15.954 --> 24:17.998
Detective Taber had a heart attack?

24:18.081 --> 24:21.042
Uh, I heard he was sick, Captain.
I'd already left.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.377
I'm Simon Meyers, Captain,

24:22.461 --> 24:25.338
a very small frog
in a very large and dirty pond.

24:25.422 --> 24:26.673
Save it, Meyers!

24:26.756 --> 24:29.134
I don't know why I've been singled out
for this kind of treatment!

24:29.217 --> 24:31.344
-It must be your lucky day.
-Sit!

24:33.597 --> 24:35.307
Phone call, Sarge. It's urgent.

24:36.808 --> 24:39.144
Jablonsky. Where?

24:40.061 --> 24:42.647
Okay, stay put. Seal it off.

24:44.816 --> 24:48.153
Captain, Klosinki and Frame
answered a complaint.

24:48.236 --> 24:50.447
They found two bodies
in a basement near Lincoln.

24:51.615 --> 24:54.367
-Torsos, same M.O.
-Any chance for an I.D.?

24:54.451 --> 24:56.453
No. It looks like they've been there
a long time.

24:56.536 --> 24:59.331
That much decomposition,
they usually work off dental records.

24:59.414 --> 25:00.582
Okay. Keep me posted.

25:02.709 --> 25:04.044
-Natalie.
-Yeah?

25:05.128 --> 25:06.463
Get those to dispatch.

25:06.546 --> 25:08.381
We want detectives, S.I.D.
at that address.

25:08.465 --> 25:09.382
Right.

25:10.634 --> 25:13.178
Captain! You countermanded my orders?

25:13.261 --> 25:15.055
-Chief.
-Don't "Chief" me!

25:15.138 --> 25:19.184
Warren Brisco was just at the undercover
and said Mayo is back on duty!

25:19.267 --> 25:21.895
If we're gonna do the laundry
in public again,

25:21.978 --> 25:24.940
then we're gonna do<i> all </i>of it,
starting with the date last night.

25:36.117 --> 25:38.119
What's that little tramp saying I did?

25:38.203 --> 25:39.579
Detective Mayo is saying

25:39.663 --> 25:42.082
that after repeated
and insistent invitations,

25:42.165 --> 25:44.876
you took her to dinner last night,
that you had too much to drink,

25:44.960 --> 25:48.380
tried to get her on a sensitivity weekend
with you at Camp Hyperion,

25:48.463 --> 25:50.173
then took her home
and pawed at her clothes

25:50.257 --> 25:51.633
while propositioning her.

25:52.509 --> 25:55.387
-That's amazing! That's ludicrous!
-Is it true?

25:56.221 --> 25:58.181
A, it's a total distortion.

25:58.265 --> 26:00.141
B, what happened last night
has nothing to do

26:00.225 --> 26:02.727
with Mayo refusing
a direct command this morning.

26:02.811 --> 26:04.354
As a witness, I'd have to testify

26:04.437 --> 26:06.898
that Mayo's response
to your order was ambiguous.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.316
She refused it!

26:08.400 --> 26:10.944
She said she didn't think
the operation was safe!

26:11.027 --> 26:13.363
You suspended her before
she had a chance to refuse.

26:13.446 --> 26:15.407
If you're choosing up with Mayo
in this little donnybrook,

26:15.490 --> 26:18.034
Captain, I can promise you
you're gonna land on your fanny!

26:18.118 --> 26:19.661
I don't want to choose sides.

26:20.078 --> 26:21.079
I want you to realize

26:21.162 --> 26:23.373
that Mayo may have grounds
for harassment charges.

26:23.665 --> 26:24.791
They'd never stand up.

26:24.874 --> 26:27.836
Maybe not. The point is she doesn't even
want to bring them.

26:28.211 --> 26:29.838
All she wants to do is be a cop,

26:30.255 --> 26:33.258
if you can control your wounded
vanity enough to let her.

26:35.468 --> 26:36.886
Oh, God, it's true.

26:41.516 --> 26:45.604
I was trying to sexually intimidate
an attractive subordinate.

26:46.646 --> 26:49.024
When she refused my shoddy advances,

26:49.649 --> 26:51.776
I was so humiliated, I wanted to hurt her.

26:54.779 --> 26:56.406
(sighs)

26:57.907 --> 27:00.744
We all have to grapple
with our impulses, Chief...

27:02.495 --> 27:04.831
but I wouldn't complicate things
by bringing charges.

27:04.914 --> 27:08.376
I had fantasies about her
slamming the door on me

27:08.460 --> 27:11.212
and calling some young stud boyfriend,

27:11.296 --> 27:14.257
sharing a laugh about
old "Fletch the lech."

27:16.551 --> 27:18.678
(stammers) I gather you'd be willing to--

27:18.762 --> 27:22.307
(voice breaking) Oh, God.
This separation's killing me!

27:25.852 --> 27:27.145
I've been there, Chief.

27:28.146 --> 27:30.106
-Most of us have.
-(sobs)

27:31.566 --> 27:33.526
It hurts, but it's not fatal.

27:33.693 --> 27:35.612
(stammers) We learn from it.

27:35.695 --> 27:37.781
(clears throat) We grow, I hope.

27:39.741 --> 27:40.575
It's okay.

27:42.410 --> 27:43.411
You're okay.

27:48.041 --> 27:50.585
I'll talk to the young woman.
I'll make it right.

27:54.297 --> 27:57.008
You're protecting me
from cruel and venal impulses, Frank.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.721
You're a good man! Bless you, Frank!

28:07.602 --> 28:09.938
MAN: Right here on the tow sheet
it says "clear."

28:11.981 --> 28:13.316
Bless you, too, Ray.

28:22.450 --> 28:25.078
WOMAN (on P.A.):
<i>Dr. Brunet, surgery one, stat.</i>

28:25.704 --> 28:28.456
I am not gonna pray the man dies, Neal.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.125
I'm not gonna hope he dies,

28:30.208 --> 28:32.127
even if my only chance
to stay on the force

28:32.210 --> 28:34.671
is if that rat croaks
without regaining consciousness

28:34.754 --> 28:36.047
to say what it is I did.

28:37.048 --> 28:39.884
I'm gonna take the heat, J.D.
I'm gonna say I did it.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.553
-No way.
-My jacket's got room, baby.

28:41.636 --> 28:43.430
I don't think yours can take the weight.

28:45.557 --> 28:51.104
One time... One time,
if it's the Lord's will, let him go.

28:51.187 --> 28:53.648
Doc, uh, how's detective Taber doin'?

28:53.732 --> 28:55.817
You will be glad to know
it was a mild infarction.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.777
-He ought to be just fine.
-Oh.

28:58.862 --> 28:59.779
Good.

29:03.032 --> 29:04.826
-Hi, fellas.
-Mel.

29:04.909 --> 29:08.204
-How you feelin'?
-They say it was a mild one.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.081
They think I'm gonna do okay.

29:10.165 --> 29:12.876
I don't know how to start
tellin' ya how sorry I am, Mel.

29:12.959 --> 29:15.336
Listen, I'm grateful for what you did.

29:16.212 --> 29:17.046
Uh-huh.

29:17.422 --> 29:20.008
Getting me right in, getting me looked at.

29:20.508 --> 29:21.843
The doctor said that was crucial.

29:21.926 --> 29:24.220
What happened when you went
back to the freezer?

29:24.304 --> 29:26.473
What difference does it make, Neal?

29:26.556 --> 29:28.183
I'm damned if I know what happened.

29:28.475 --> 29:31.561
I went back there,
I'm lookin' for the box,

29:31.770 --> 29:35.774
and I get like a fist in my chest.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.025
Thank goodness.

29:37.442 --> 29:40.820
Mel seems to have come
through this unscathed, Neal.

29:41.571 --> 29:44.365
Why don't we get the hell out of here,
let this man catch his strength?

29:44.741 --> 29:46.493
You know what I'm lyin' here thinkin'?

29:47.202 --> 29:50.163
Somebody wants me to turn over a new leaf.

29:50.955 --> 29:53.166
WOMAN (on P.A.):
<i>Cath-room tech to Dr. Stillman.</i>

29:54.125 --> 29:56.961
Yeah, well, uh, good luck
with your program, Mel.

29:58.254 --> 29:59.130
See ya.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.257
Heh-heh, turn over a new leaf?

30:01.341 --> 30:03.510
Hah, cat needs to replant
his whole forest.

30:03.593 --> 30:06.221
Unbelievable.
He never even saw the head, Neal.

30:06.304 --> 30:08.014
Now I wish I'd hit the sucker!

30:08.765 --> 30:10.475
You know what I'm gonna do with this?

30:10.975 --> 30:13.770
-You know who's perfect for this?
-What are you talking about?

30:14.062 --> 30:17.357
The head, Coffey's perfect.
He freaks with this stuff.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.400
J.D., you just dodged a Howitzer.

30:19.484 --> 30:21.486
I've got a perfectly good head here, Neal.

30:21.569 --> 30:24.781
I'm not just gonna give it back.
It's an unfired shot.

30:31.079 --> 30:33.957
Bobby, I swear this
is the first unit I drove

30:34.040 --> 30:35.750
when I come on this force.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.086
It can't be.
They retire these units every... (sniffs)

30:38.169 --> 30:39.838
-Radio's broke.
-every three years.

30:39.921 --> 30:42.340
There it is again.
Do you smell that burnin' odor?

30:42.423 --> 30:44.843
-Rubber burnin' or somethin' like that.
-What is that?

30:45.218 --> 30:46.553
What's the matter? Are you lonesome?

30:46.636 --> 30:48.513
Hey, want a good time?

30:50.348 --> 30:53.560
-All right, Angela, I got you in sight.
-ANGELA (on radio):<i> Roger, Lieutenant.</i>

30:53.643 --> 30:56.104
MAN: My paycheck's way down.

30:56.604 --> 30:58.439
ANGELA:<i> Excuse me. Customer?</i>

31:04.279 --> 31:06.739
<i>Nice van. What color blue's this?</i>

31:06.823 --> 31:08.658
MAN:<i> Royal blue. Come on for a drive.</i>

31:12.745 --> 31:14.706
<i>-Call you angel?</i>
<i>-You want me to be your an--</i>

31:14.789 --> 31:16.749
(silence)

31:16.833 --> 31:18.543
-ANGELA:<i> Please.</i>
-MAN:<i> Just shut up!</i>

31:19.502 --> 31:21.921
All units, code 10-39.

31:22.005 --> 31:23.882
<i>Decap suspect in blue van,</i>

31:23.965 --> 31:26.718
<i>Grant and Weaver, code 10-39.</i>

31:27.260 --> 31:31.264
-Let's go.
-(siren wailing)

31:43.526 --> 31:45.653
Police! You're completely surrounded!

31:45.737 --> 31:47.405
Come out of there
with your hands high and empty!

31:47.488 --> 31:49.032
Hey, I'm not the guy you're thinkin'!

31:49.115 --> 31:51.200
I was just jokin' with this woman!
That's all!

31:51.284 --> 31:53.286
That's good. Get out of there,
we'll talk about it.

31:53.369 --> 31:55.330
Or maybe I should cut her throat!

31:56.289 --> 31:59.042
That woman is a cop!
You got no chance of getting out of here.

31:59.125 --> 32:01.419
You don't know anything about this woman!

32:01.502 --> 32:04.839
She's disguised as a whore, but under
the disguise, she really is a whore!

32:07.300 --> 32:09.719
(grunting)

32:09.802 --> 32:12.263
-You are under arrest.
-Come on, let's go!

32:12.347 --> 32:15.016
I haven't got any brakes! Hold on!
I haven't got any brakes!

32:15.099 --> 32:16.434
-(tires screech)
-Anything you say

32:16.517 --> 32:18.937
can and will be used against
you in a court of law.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.814
I can't help it! I can't help it!

32:21.898 --> 32:24.233
(tires screech)

32:28.738 --> 32:30.406
(indistinct shouting)

32:30.490 --> 32:32.533
MAN: You ruined my newspaper stand!

32:33.534 --> 32:36.704
Uh, you have the right to an attorney.

32:37.121 --> 32:40.208
You have the right to have that attorney
present during questioning.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.793
-Back, people, come on!
-What's his name?

32:41.876 --> 32:45.046
-(clamoring)
-Back, please!

32:45.129 --> 32:47.757
Chief, is he a suspect
in the Decap killings?

32:47.840 --> 32:48.675
Did he confess?

32:48.758 --> 32:50.551
Says he wants to talk to us,
says he doesn't want a lawyer.

32:50.635 --> 32:51.928
-No comment.
-Gotta be the guy, Frank--

32:52.011 --> 32:54.055
couldn't be two guys
that crazy on the street.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.265
-The Decap suspect?
-(chattering)

32:56.349 --> 32:58.309
Got good Miranda,
says he wants to talk to us,

32:58.393 --> 32:59.560
says he doesn't want a lawyer.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.896
I prefer he have counsel, Frank.
We don't want to lose a confession.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.815
Get him a P.D. and let's interrogate.

33:04.857 --> 33:07.026
Joyce, let's not be too fastidious here.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.487
If the guy wants to talk,
I want to hear what he has to say.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.365
Sergeant, caution the press

33:12.448 --> 33:15.034
on disclosure of the operation
till we see if this is the guy.

33:15.118 --> 33:16.077
Will do, sir.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.960
A moment of your time,
Detective, in private?

33:25.545 --> 33:28.339
-Did you talk to Captain Furillo?
-Yes, I did.

33:30.675 --> 33:31.676
This way.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.230
After further consideration,

33:45.523 --> 33:47.650
I decided I overreacted this morning.

33:48.484 --> 33:50.695
I don't condone your questioning
your assignment,

33:50.778 --> 33:54.407
but Captain Furillo has persuaded me
the matter was being handled internally.

33:55.450 --> 33:57.160
At any rate, I want to apologize.

33:57.243 --> 34:00.079
-You called me a coward.
-I applauded Bates' bravery.

34:00.163 --> 34:03.666
You called me a coward, Chief,
and I'm not.

34:04.959 --> 34:05.835
I know you're not.

34:07.003 --> 34:08.087
I apologize.

34:10.840 --> 34:11.799
Okay.

34:12.967 --> 34:15.553
This damn sex business
between men and women,

34:16.554 --> 34:18.139
it really mucks things up, doesn't it?

34:18.931 --> 34:19.891
It can.

34:20.892 --> 34:22.769
You're a damn good detective, Detective.

34:27.982 --> 34:28.941
I mean that.

34:30.026 --> 34:30.985
Thank you.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.155
And a damn sexy one, too.

34:34.989 --> 34:37.158
Fletcher, cease!

34:41.746 --> 34:42.872
I want it on the record

34:42.955 --> 34:45.792
that I recommended against
Mr. Morris talking to you.

34:46.584 --> 34:49.879
It's also on record that Mr. Morris
has been fully advised.

34:50.296 --> 34:53.257
You're speaking to us of your own choice,
Mr. Morris, is that correct?

34:53.341 --> 34:54.717
Is the hen party over now?

34:54.801 --> 34:56.344
Please answer the question.

34:56.427 --> 34:57.762
Yes, I'm talking to you freely.

34:58.679 --> 35:02.308
-You're talking of your own free will?
-Yes. Do you want this or not?

35:02.975 --> 35:04.685
-Yes, we do.
-There are seven murders

35:04.769 --> 35:06.979
we believe were committed
by the same person.

35:07.063 --> 35:09.774
And, what do you know, here's someone
that wants to talk about something.

35:09.857 --> 35:13.778
We've found seven women murdered
in what appears to be a similar way.

35:14.237 --> 35:15.279
Uh-huh.

35:15.655 --> 35:18.032
-Did you commit those murders?
-Uh-huh.

35:23.788 --> 35:24.622
(door closes)

35:24.705 --> 35:27.625
RENKO: ...smell somethin',
and I says, "I do, too."

35:27.708 --> 35:29.836
Albert Desjardins,
head of Division Accounting,

35:29.919 --> 35:32.171
-here to see Captain Furillo.
-I'll let him know you're here.

35:32.255 --> 35:34.674
-Are you Mr. Dee-jardin?
-Desjardins, correct.

35:34.757 --> 35:37.343
-Division Accounting?
-That is correct, Officer.

35:37.426 --> 35:40.847
Uh, sir, Mr. Desjardins, I wonder if I
could ask you somethin' for a minute, sir.

35:40.930 --> 35:43.432
Uh, I was wondering, if you at Division

35:43.516 --> 35:46.435
are gonna be so sticky
about holdin' officers responsible

35:46.519 --> 35:48.646
for the condition of their vehicles
when they come back,

35:48.729 --> 35:51.858
I wonder if you're gonna be such sticklers
about how they are when they go out?

35:52.900 --> 35:55.027
Officer, I haven't a clue
to what you're talking about.

35:55.111 --> 35:57.405
Well, sir, what I'm talkin'
about is me and my partner,

35:57.488 --> 35:59.657
Officer Hill, who's standin'
behind you here, sir--

35:59.740 --> 36:02.535
Well, we got a replacement vehicle
from the motor pool,

36:02.618 --> 36:04.954
and it braked about as good
as my Aunt Elvira,

36:05.037 --> 36:06.873
which means it didn't have
no brakes at all.

36:06.956 --> 36:09.083
Oh, well, what you're talking about here,
Officer, is a compensation claim,

36:09.167 --> 36:12.086
totally different department.
Albert Desjardins, Captain Furillo.

36:12.837 --> 36:15.298
-Finish up.
-I'm just asking this gentleman, sir,

36:15.381 --> 36:17.758
why it is that Division Accounting
spends so much time

36:17.842 --> 36:20.803
tryin' to figure out how to
nickel-and-dime the officers in the field.

36:20.887 --> 36:22.763
You'll get no quarrel
from this quarter, Andy.

36:22.847 --> 36:26.184
See, we put our lives on the line
every day, Mr. Desjardins.

36:26.267 --> 36:27.560
Every day.

36:28.519 --> 36:31.647
Uh, Division appreciates
the job you men are doing,

36:31.731 --> 36:34.901
and many, many thanks today
for this input, hmm?

36:34.984 --> 36:36.736
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you, sir.

36:36.819 --> 36:38.112
-Thank you, gentlemen.
-Sir.

36:39.197 --> 36:42.158
This has not been a great day in the life
of Albert Desjardins, Captain.

36:42.241 --> 36:44.619
Well, thanks for getting back so promptly.

36:45.244 --> 36:47.830
Um, it won't come as a shock if I tell you

36:47.914 --> 36:49.999
yours was not the only complaint
we had this morning.

36:50.082 --> 36:52.877
I've been on a roadshow
all day to the precincts.

36:54.879 --> 36:56.505
Now, sir, we don't ask

36:56.589 --> 36:58.716
that you fall in love
with the new phone policy.

36:59.634 --> 37:01.677
We just ask that you try to understand.

37:02.261 --> 37:04.555
Let me try to save you a little time here,
Mr. Desjardins.

37:04.639 --> 37:08.184
I just want to show you
the results of our study

37:08.267 --> 37:11.812
of the ratio between
personal to private calls

37:11.896 --> 37:12.980
on the precinct phones.

37:13.064 --> 37:15.274
And I am telling you
you can take your studies

37:15.358 --> 37:17.902
and shove them back in your briefcase.

37:18.444 --> 37:19.904
A cop has a right to come off his shift

37:19.987 --> 37:21.572
and call home to say
he's gonna be late for dinner.

37:21.656 --> 37:22.782
Oh, of course he does, sir.

37:22.865 --> 37:25.576
We're not expecting anything
like full compliance.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.870
What this directive does
is it lets the men know

37:27.954 --> 37:30.206
that Accounting's out there.
Puts the fear of God in them.

37:30.289 --> 37:32.959
Like our personal responsibility directive
on damage to cars.

37:33.042 --> 37:34.210
Keeps the men on their toes.

37:34.293 --> 37:36.837
Mr. Desjardins, as far as I'm concerned,
the directives don't exist.

37:38.547 --> 37:40.007
Oh, now, you can tear up
all the studies you like,

37:40.091 --> 37:41.509
but it will not make
the directives go away.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.427
As far as I'm concerned,<i> you </i>don't exist.

37:43.511 --> 37:45.054
Oh, that's very constructive, sir.

37:46.430 --> 37:48.432
Now I feel like making
a personal phone call.

37:49.475 --> 37:50.810
Overseas operator, please.

37:50.893 --> 37:52.103
There's nothing in the directive that says

37:52.186 --> 37:53.729
you can't make
a personal phone call, Captain.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.314
Ah, Turin, Italy.

37:55.856 --> 37:58.276
Only thing directive says is that
you're gonna have to pay us back.

37:58.359 --> 37:59.694
I'd like to see you try to collect.

38:00.278 --> 38:05.825
Uh-huh, yeah, 0884473.

38:06.951 --> 38:10.121
Person-to-person?
That's more expensive, isn't it?

38:11.163 --> 38:13.833
Good, okay, yeah,
then let's make it person-to-person.

38:13.916 --> 38:19.672
To Tommaso Feltrenelli.
Uh-huh, yeah, from Francis Furillo.

38:20.006 --> 38:22.133
Gee, I haven't talked
to my Uncle Tommaso in...

38:22.633 --> 38:23.551
must be over a year now.

38:23.634 --> 38:25.052
You'll forgive me if I don't stay around

38:25.136 --> 38:27.179
for the rest of this
petulant drama, Captain.

38:29.682 --> 38:33.352
Uh, operator, listen,
I'd like to cancel-- Hello?

38:35.146 --> 38:36.314
(speaking Italian)

38:37.398 --> 38:39.025
Uh,<i> sí.</i>

38:39.108 --> 38:41.193
No, no--<i> bène. </i>(laughs nervously)

38:42.820 --> 38:43.738
Mick...

38:43.821 --> 38:47.325
Mick, I'm afraid I am the bearer
of a temporary eviction notice.

38:47.408 --> 38:48.492
What's going on?

38:48.576 --> 38:53.122
I have decided to drive Pegasus
up to the lake region this weekend.

38:55.666 --> 38:56.751
Okay.

38:58.294 --> 39:01.839
Well, you know you're more than welcome
to occupy Sunday night.

39:01.922 --> 39:07.094
Actually, I think I'll look for another
place to live this weekend, Lieutenant.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.263
Well, I hope the short notice
doesn't give offense, Mick.

39:09.347 --> 39:12.641
I mean, the travel notion
just came over me this morning.

39:12.725 --> 39:13.768
It's no problem.

39:14.727 --> 39:16.562
Got his game face on, huh, Lieutenant?

39:17.521 --> 39:18.481
Excuse me?

39:18.564 --> 39:20.775
Mick's got his game face on
for the bowling league tonight.

39:20.858 --> 39:22.360
You gonna come out and watch us?

39:22.735 --> 39:27.448
Oh, no, I think I'll pass, Sergeant,
but I'll be with you in spirit.

39:27.531 --> 39:28.908
Attaboy.

39:28.991 --> 39:32.244
Actually, I think I may pass
on the bowling myself, Sarge.

39:32.328 --> 39:33.829
The hell you say.

39:35.206 --> 39:40.127
Mick, it don't take a genius to see
that you got the birthday blahs.

39:40.211 --> 39:43.589
Even if you hadn't ixnayed my announcing
it at roll call this morning.

39:43.672 --> 39:46.008
I just think I'd like to spend
a quiet night at home

39:46.092 --> 39:47.593
in my trailer, that's all.

39:47.676 --> 39:48.636
Malarkey.

39:49.553 --> 39:52.556
Listen, Mick, didn't we have
a good time the other night

39:52.640 --> 39:53.974
when I nearly had to shanghai you?

39:54.058 --> 39:56.394
We went out, we had that nice Polish duck.

39:56.477 --> 39:57.395
Yeah, that was fun.

39:57.478 --> 39:59.855
All right, then.
You listen to Dr. Jablonski.

39:59.939 --> 40:01.357
We'll bowl.

40:01.440 --> 40:04.819
Then afterwards we might go to Mulligan's,
have a few brews

40:04.902 --> 40:08.364
which shall be free and gratis
to a certain individual

40:08.447 --> 40:09.990
on account of what day it is.

40:10.950 --> 40:13.577
I'm 37 years old, and I'm alone.

40:15.830 --> 40:16.997
That's right.

40:18.707 --> 40:20.167
You gonna take it lying down?

40:22.753 --> 40:23.838
Good for you.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.678
Captain, I've got it all straightened out
with Chief Daniels.

40:30.761 --> 40:31.887
-Good.
-Thank you.

40:31.971 --> 40:33.222
No need for thanks.

40:33.305 --> 40:35.349
And thank you for this morning, too

40:35.433 --> 40:37.518
not trying to talk me out of my fear.

40:38.978 --> 40:40.563
For being the kind of man you are.

40:45.651 --> 40:47.361
To whom it may concern,

40:47.445 --> 40:51.532
I had my braces taken off today,
and I think I look very good.

40:51.991 --> 40:55.786
In fact, I think my smile
is very much better.

40:56.412 --> 40:57.580
Thank you, and good night.

40:58.122 --> 41:00.875
-WOMAN: Good night, Fay.
-MAN: Good night, Mrs. Furillo.

41:05.129 --> 41:06.172
Hey, Pats.

41:06.922 --> 41:08.466
Listen, I hear you nailed
that killer today.

41:08.549 --> 41:10.426
Is that right, you were in on that?

41:10.509 --> 41:13.220
-Yeah, we got him.
-Good going. You must feel terrific.

41:13.971 --> 41:15.306
It's been a long day.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.601
Listen, Pats,
I never got a chance to ask you,

41:18.684 --> 41:20.394
how was your date with the chief?

41:22.021 --> 41:22.980
Swell.

41:24.106 --> 41:25.983
I'll tell you all about it sometime.

41:27.234 --> 41:28.068
Whenever.

41:29.028 --> 41:29.904
You okay?

41:31.155 --> 41:32.031
Yeah.

41:33.282 --> 41:34.700
I missed you today, Harry.

41:37.077 --> 41:38.120
Thanks.

41:46.629 --> 41:49.340
Big, strong guy like you.
Now, who'd have figured it?

41:49.423 --> 41:51.884
Hey, look, J.D., I don't have
to prove my masculinity

41:51.967 --> 41:54.678
-off the weight of my bowling ball.
-Fourteen-and-a-half-pound ball.

41:54.762 --> 41:56.680
Hey, you get more lift
and better mix with the pins.

41:56.764 --> 41:58.849
Oh, yeah, yeah. Let me see your ball.

41:58.933 --> 42:01.393
Why don't you go all the way, J.D.,
and try it at the bowling tonight?

42:01.477 --> 42:04.230
'Cause I ain't bowling tonight
is why, wiseguy.

42:04.313 --> 42:06.482
Hey, if it's a big thing, forget it, huh?
Never mind.

42:06.565 --> 42:07.775
All right. All right!

42:09.818 --> 42:11.445
If you ever tried this,
you'd know what I'm talking about.

42:11.529 --> 42:12.571
All right. Let me see.

42:14.156 --> 42:17.368
Jeez! What the hell is that?

42:17.451 --> 42:20.162
(laughing)

42:24.959 --> 42:25.960
What'd you do, J.D.?

42:26.043 --> 42:27.836
You put this in while
I was shaving, didn't you?

42:27.920 --> 42:30.047
You think that's real funny, don't you?

42:30.839 --> 42:33.759
-You stupid jerk!
-Hey, hey, take it easy, Joe.

42:34.677 --> 42:36.470
You got a problem, Coffey?

42:36.554 --> 42:37.763
You're the one with the problem, LaRue.

42:37.846 --> 42:40.224
-NEAL: Okay, Joe, take it easy, man.
-Way to take a joke, fella.

42:40.307 --> 42:42.768
Oh, yeah? Yeah, how 'bout this, J.D.?

42:42.851 --> 42:44.353
You think this is a million laughs?

42:44.436 --> 42:46.897
-You think this is funny, LaRue?
-What the hell's the matter with you?

42:46.981 --> 42:48.357
Hey, Joe. Come on, Joe.
Put the piece away now, man!

42:48.440 --> 42:51.026
Hey, you stay out of this.
This guy makes me sick.

42:52.111 --> 42:53.362
You're gonna give somebody
a heart attack, LaRue.

42:53.445 --> 42:55.447
-Hey, come on. Don't do it, Joe.
-(gunshot)

42:55.531 --> 42:57.616
-MAN: Neal! Joe!
-Neal!

42:57.700 --> 43:00.244
RENKO: Lord have mercy! Look at this.
Bobby, look at this.

43:00.327 --> 43:02.788
Get somebody down here, quick!

43:02.871 --> 43:03.956
-Neal, you okay?
-I gotta get an ambulance!

43:04.039 --> 43:06.709
LARUE: Oh, God, Neal.
Oh, this is all my fault!

43:07.167 --> 43:09.128
-(weakly) I... I...
-What?

43:09.211 --> 43:11.380
I caught you with your--

43:11.463 --> 43:14.508
<i>♪ Backfield in motion ♪</i>

43:14.592 --> 43:16.552
<i>♪ I'm gonna have to penalize you ♪</i>

43:16.635 --> 43:17.928
<i>♪ Ooh ♪</i>

43:18.012 --> 43:20.973
<i>♪ Backfield in motion, baby ♪</i>

43:21.056 --> 43:22.808
<i>♪ You know that's against the rules ♪</i>

43:22.891 --> 43:23.976
Okay, all of youse.

43:24.893 --> 43:28.022
I'll tell you why this ain't funny,
why this is not the same thing!

43:28.105 --> 43:29.189
Tell us about it, baby!

43:29.273 --> 43:33.110
It's not the same because
of the spirit it was intended in!

43:33.193 --> 43:34.486
(all laughing)

43:34.570 --> 43:37.156
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

43:37.239 --> 43:40.117
I wouldn't expect any of you to get it!
Jerks!

43:43.912 --> 43:47.041
-The man was had!
-(mumbles, laughs)

43:47.124 --> 43:50.210
Hey, the chorus definitely needs work.

43:50.294 --> 43:51.879
Aw, get outta here!

43:52.504 --> 43:54.423
It all depends whose ox gets gored.

43:56.425 --> 43:58.302
When Daniels was bullying
Patsy Mayo this morning,

43:58.385 --> 44:00.054
I said to myself,

44:00.137 --> 44:02.556
"Boy, I don't ever want to have
an ego that fragile."

44:03.766 --> 44:06.060
Four hours later, I'm ranting and raving

44:06.143 --> 44:08.228
and making a totally pointless
call to Turin, Italy,

44:08.312 --> 44:10.189
trying to put some emotional distance
between me

44:10.272 --> 44:13.567
and this Uriah Heep
from Division Accounting.

44:15.235 --> 44:16.153
(sighs)

44:21.075 --> 44:24.662
-How 'bout a little spousal support here?
-(laughs)

44:24.745 --> 44:27.831
How 'bout a little
"There's a world of difference, Frank."

44:27.915 --> 44:30.668
-There's a world of difference, Frank.
-More feeling.

44:31.126 --> 44:33.253
There is. (laughs)

44:34.129 --> 44:36.924
You weren't making cheap passes at anyone.

44:39.259 --> 44:42.429
Boy, I don't want to end up like Daniels
15 years from now, I'll tell you that.

44:42.513 --> 44:43.722
No chance.

44:44.390 --> 44:47.017
That's not to say I don't want
to be making passes.

44:49.436 --> 44:50.521
Let's go home, Frank.

44:51.480 --> 44:53.816
Maybe I can give your ego a boost.

45:49.413 --> 45:50.581
(creaks)

45:53.167 --> 45:54.376
Lieutenant, that you?

45:55.043 --> 45:58.881
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

46:00.632 --> 46:04.303
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

46:05.679 --> 46:09.683
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Michael ♪</i>

46:11.268 --> 46:14.188
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

46:19.109 --> 46:20.027
How'd you get in?

46:21.487 --> 46:23.906
-I picked the lock.
-Why?

46:25.699 --> 46:26.700
I missed you.

46:28.327 --> 46:31.163
(stammers) I wanted to be with you
on your birthday.

46:33.457 --> 46:35.501
Well, what about that other guy?

46:38.128 --> 46:41.215
I may not have gotten everything
I needed from you, Mick,

46:43.842 --> 46:45.844
but without you, I don't have any of it.

46:50.098 --> 46:51.350
I don't know what to say.

46:54.228 --> 46:55.687
-Do you want me to go?
-No.

46:58.565 --> 46:59.566
Look...

47:04.571 --> 47:06.031
Ever since you...

47:08.617 --> 47:12.162
Ever since we decided
to stop seeing each other,

47:14.206 --> 47:15.624
it's all been wrong.

47:19.419 --> 47:21.380
I know I'm not an easy person...

47:29.847 --> 47:32.224
-But if maybe you could give me another--
-(shushes)

47:33.517 --> 47:36.144
Just make a wish and blow out the candles.

48:02.963 --> 48:05.841
