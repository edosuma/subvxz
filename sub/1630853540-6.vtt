- Hey.

35:12.197 --> 35:13.850
You can go to jail
for that around here.

35:13.894 --> 35:15.287
- [chuckles]

35:15.330 --> 35:17.767
Yeah, can't seem to stay
out of trouble.

35:20.988 --> 35:23.121
- Yeah, I heard
you were kicking around.

35:29.692 --> 35:32.130
Thinking about staying a while?
- It's crossed my mind.

35:34.306 --> 35:35.611
I left the bureau.

35:35.655 --> 35:38.614
- Yeah, I heard.
What do you have planned?

35:38.658 --> 35:41.051
- I haven't thought
that far ahead.

35:41.095 --> 35:44.185
I'm keeping my options open
- Hmm.

35:44.229 --> 35:46.709
Well, we could always use
your help around here.

35:46.753 --> 35:48.624
- You'd have me back?
- Yeah.

35:48.668 --> 35:50.670
I think I could wrap
my head around it.

35:50.713 --> 35:52.759
- [chuckles]

35:52.802 --> 35:56.589
[sighs]

35:56.632 --> 35:59.461
This place is a lot smaller
than I remember.

35:59.505 --> 36:01.159
- Yeah.

36:01.202 --> 36:04.466
It's the world
has gotten bigger, Chee.

36:04.510 --> 36:06.425
You got
a beautiful place out here.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.040
Yeah.

36:15.869 --> 36:19.177
But I'm not just here
on a social call.

36:19.220 --> 36:20.265
- Okay.

36:21.875 --> 36:24.704
- I need to know
what happened back at the cave.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.839
- I had to protect
a friend of a friend.

36:29.883 --> 36:31.493
- I respect that.

36:31.537 --> 36:33.321
- If I had the chance
to do things differently,

36:33.365 --> 36:34.627
I would have.

36:34.670 --> 36:36.542
I messed up,
but what's done is done.

36:36.585 --> 36:39.371
- [breathes deeply]

36:39.414 --> 36:40.894
Who else knows about this?

36:43.288 --> 36:45.681
- Bern.

36:45.725 --> 36:47.422
We were just trying
to protect you,

36:47.466 --> 36:48.510
trying to keep you out of it.

36:53.689 --> 36:55.169
- They excavated the cave.

36:58.999 --> 37:01.436
You said in your report
that Nakai wasn't dead yet

37:01.480 --> 37:03.264
and he shot Whitover
in the back

37:03.308 --> 37:05.179
when he tried to make off
with the money,

37:05.223 --> 37:06.876
but then he died later.

37:09.183 --> 37:12.099
- Yeah.
That's what I reported.

37:12.142 --> 37:13.840
- Then you
and Sergeant Manuelito

37:13.883 --> 37:15.798
checked the rest
of the crime scene.

37:15.842 --> 37:17.844
You heard the explosion,

37:17.887 --> 37:20.803
but you got out
before the cave collapsed.

37:20.847 --> 37:23.284
- That was the story.

37:23.328 --> 37:25.112
- You speculated
that it might have been

37:25.155 --> 37:27.549
the white man,
Pete Samuels, who did it.

37:27.593 --> 37:28.507
- Yeah.

37:33.163 --> 37:34.687
- Who really pressed
the detonator?

37:36.384 --> 37:40.170
- [sighs]

37:40.214 --> 37:41.911
I did.

37:41.955 --> 37:45.045
- Well, that would account
for the missing money, huh?

37:45.088 --> 37:47.308
- "Missing money"?
- Yeah.

37:47.352 --> 37:48.962
They didn't find any money.

37:49.005 --> 37:50.790
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that.

37:54.402 --> 37:56.099
- I didn't take it, if that's
what you're getting at.

37:59.015 --> 38:00.278
- I know you didn't

38:02.584 --> 38:05.805
- The money was there.
I know it was.

38:05.848 --> 38:07.633
- You also said
there were two bodies.

38:07.676 --> 38:08.634
They only found one.

38:13.378 --> 38:16.032
Nakai's missing.

38:16.076 --> 38:18.687
FBI is being pretty
tight-lipped about it.

38:18.731 --> 38:22.952
But as far as the report goes,
it's your word against his.

38:22.996 --> 38:25.346
I don't see him making
a statement anytime soon.

38:25.390 --> 38:26.826
So...

38:26.869 --> 38:29.698
[inhales deeply, chuckles]

38:29.742 --> 38:32.092
You're a lucky son of a bitch.

38:32.135 --> 38:33.920
You know that?
- [chuckles]

38:37.097 --> 38:38.141
- Yeah.

38:38.185 --> 38:39.752
Anyway...

38:39.795 --> 38:42.232
I got to get back home.

38:42.276 --> 38:45.323
Emma and Sally and the baby
are waiting for me.

38:55.855 --> 38:57.596
- Joe.
- Yeah.

38:59.511 --> 39:01.339
- I, uh...

39:04.298 --> 39:05.604
- I know.
