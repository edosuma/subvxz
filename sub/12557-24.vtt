UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT,</i>

10:38.513 --> 10:43.007
<i>AND THIS IS WHERE
I GOT INTO THE ACT.</i>

10:43.101 --> 10:46.639
(male voice) WELL, CHAMBERS,
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

10:46.729 --> 10:50.643
A CORKER OF A MIGRAINE
HEADACHE AND EYE STRAIN.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.440
YOU CAN'T
LICK IT?

10:52.527 --> 10:55.019
NO, NOT IN EIGHT HOURS, I CAN'T.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.774
COLONEL, IT TOOK
US ALMOST A YEAR

10:56.865 --> 10:58.355
TO CRACK THE
JAPANESE CODE--

10:58.449 --> 11:01.111
WE HAD AN ARMY OF MEN
WORKING ON THAT.

11:01.202 --> 11:04.820
BUT THIS IS A LANGUAGE OF
PEOPLE FROM OUTER SPACE,

11:04.914 --> 11:07.656
PROBABLY 500 TIMES
AS INTELLIGENT AS WE ARE

11:07.750 --> 11:09.661
AND A THOUSAND TIMES
MORE COMPLEX.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.208
YOU NEED MORE HELP?

11:11.296 --> 11:14.334
ALL DONATIONS
GRATEFULLY ACCEPTED.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.461
I SHOVVED THIS TO EVERY
MAN ON OUR STAFF.

11:16.551 --> 11:19.464
I'VE HAD A DOZEN PEOPLE VVORKING
ON IT SINCE LATE LAST NIGHT.

11:19.554 --> 11:21.636
WE'VE TRIED
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING--

11:21.723 --> 11:24.260
SINGLE TRANSPOSITION,
DOUBLE TRANSPOSITION.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.217
VVE'\/E TRIED EVERY KNOVVN
METHOD OF CRYPTOGRAPHY THERE IS,

11:27.312 --> 11:29.474
AND I DON'T KNOVV WHETHER
VVE'RE E\/EN CLOSE

11:29.564 --> 11:31.020
OR A MILLION MILES AWAY.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.064
ARE YOU SAYING
IT'S INDECIPHERABLE?

11:33.151 --> 11:36.689
NO, VVE'\/E JUST GOT TO
KEEP TRYING, THAT'S ALL.

11:36.779 --> 11:40.488
STANDARD, DIRECT, REVERSED,
SYSTEMATICALLY MIXED,

11:40.575 --> 11:42.486
KEYWORD MIXED,
RANDOM MIXED,

11:42.577 --> 11:45.285
RECIPROCAL, CONJUGATE.

11:45.371 --> 11:48.033
EVERY NATURE OF SEQUENCE
OF LETTERS THERE IS.

11:48.124 --> 11:51.037
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING,
COLONEL, THIS IS A TOUGH NUT.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.289
THIS IS A
REAL TOUGH NUT.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.211
HOW IMPORTANT IS IT?

11:55.298 --> 11:58.416
HMM, I
DON'T KNOW.

11:58.509 --> 11:59.920
THAT, THAT KANAMIT,

12:00.011 --> 12:01.968
OR WHATEVER IT IS
HE CALLS HIMSELF,

12:02.055 --> 12:03.921
VVALKED OFF AND LEFT THIS
BOOK YESTERDAY AT THE U.N.

12:04.015 --> 12:06.598
THE VVHITE HOUSE FEELS IF
VVE CAN DECIPHER THIS BOOK

12:06.684 --> 12:09.142
WE CAN FIND OUT
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.687
VVELL, OB\/IOUSLY,
NOTHING BUT OUR GOOD.

12:11.773 --> 12:14.515
HE HASN'T COMMENTED ON
THE LOSS OF THIS BOOK.

12:14.609 --> 12:16.350
PROBABLY UNCONCERNED
THAT WE HAVE IT.

12:16.444 --> 12:17.980
WHY SHOULD WE
BE SO CONCERNED?

12:18.071 --> 12:20.608
THEY'\/E DONE ALL
RIGHT BY US SO FAR.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.154
PARLOR TRICKS.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.199
THEY DON'T SEEM
LIKE TRICKS, COLONEL.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.242
THAT NEW NITRATE USE
THEY DEMONSTRATED

12:26.329 --> 12:28.115
IN ARGENTINA
THIS MORNING--

12:28.206 --> 12:31.244
THAT SOIL HAD MORE VITAMINS
IN IT SIX HOURS LATER

12:31.292 --> 12:32.794
THAN A
DRUGSTORE CHAIN.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.208
I KNOW THAT COUNTRY.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.002
THAT'S AS BARREN
AND FRUITLESS

12:36.089 --> 12:38.080
AS ANY PLACE
ON EARTH.

12:38.132 --> 12:41.170
WELL...

12:41.261 --> 12:45.596
WE MIGHT LICK THIS,
WE MIGHT NOT.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.764
BUT I GOT
A STRANGE FEELING.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.227
WHAT?

12:49.310 --> 12:50.550
THAT WE'RE LOOKING

12:50.645 --> 12:52.386
A GIFT HORSE
IN THE MOUTH.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.972
I GOT ANOTHER
FUNNY FEELING, TOO.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.182
AND THAT IS?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.109
THAT IF THESE KANAMITS

12:59.195 --> 13:01.653
ARE AS HELPFUL AS
I THINK THEY ARE,

13:01.739 --> 13:04.071
YOU BOYS WILL BE
OUT OF A JOB.

13:04.158 --> 13:05.774
AND PROBABLY,
SO WILL I.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.484
AM I TO ASSUME

13:07.578 --> 13:09.831
THIS IS A SCIENTIFIC
ANALYSIS, MR. CHAMBERS,

13:09.914 --> 13:11.825
OR JUST SOME
KENTUCKY WINDAGE?

13:11.916 --> 13:14.328
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS, COLONEL,

13:14.419 --> 13:16.660
BEYOND AN
INSTINCTIVE FEELING.

13:16.754 --> 13:20.292
WHEN THIS EARTH
GETS ENOUGH TO EAT

13:20.383 --> 13:23.296
AND THERE ARE NO MORE WARS
OR DISEASES OR FAMINES,

13:23.344 --> 13:26.678
THIS IS GOING TO BE
A GARDEN OF EDEN.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.256
YOUR OPTIMISM IS MOST
REFRESHING, MR. CHAMBERS,

13:29.350 --> 13:30.966
BUT I SUGGEST
YOU CONTINUE

13:31.060 --> 13:32.801
YOUR PROCESS
OF DECIPHERING

13:32.895 --> 13:35.182
UNTIL YOU CAN
TELL US PRECISELY--

13:35.273 --> 13:37.605
AND I MEAN PRECISELY--
WHAT THAT BOOK SAYS.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.650
WE'VE LICKED THE
TITLE, ANYWAY.

13:44.741 --> 13:45.981
WHAT DOES
IT SAY?

13:46.075 --> 13:47.816
HOW MUCH
DOES IT TELL US?

13:47.910 --> 13:49.196
HERE IT IS.

13:49.287 --> 13:50.869
WELL, THAT MAKES
THE CHEESE

13:50.955 --> 13:53.162
MORE BINDING, WOULDN'T
YOU SAY, COLONEL?

13:53.249 --> 13:55.707
I'D CALL THAT A REASONABLY
ALTRUISTIC PHRASE,

13:55.793 --> 13:57.329
DO YOU
AGREE, PATTY?

13:57.420 --> 13:59.252
WELL, I, UH--

13:59.339 --> 14:01.831
WELL, I WANT TO
BELIEVE IT, BUT--

14:01.924 --> 14:06.669
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.050
<i>"TO SERVE MAN."</i>

14:09.140 --> 14:11.472
<i>I HOPE SO.</i>

14:11.559 --> 14:12.594

14:22.695 --> 14:25.357
<i>(Secretary General) GENTLEMEN,

<i>AS HUMAN BEINGS DO.</i>

15:05.029 --> 15:07.487

OF THE MANY EXPERIMENTS MADE</i>

<i>A MEASURE OF PERSPIRATION,

15:27.593 --> 15:30.506

<i>AND INTENSITY
OF THE ELECTRICAL WAVES</i>

MUCH OF IT AS YOU WANT.

19:33.756 --> 19:37.215
NOBODY NEEDS TO DECIPHER
MUCH OF ANYTHING ANYMORE

19:37.301 --> 19:39.087

ANY MORE CODES

ABOUT THE HYDROGEN BOMB

19:57.113 --> 19:59.024
YEAH, CLOSE TO IT.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.573

ARE AROUND NOW?

20:06.664 --> 20:09.201

FIGURE IT OUT?

20:09.291 --> 20:11.032
A FEW THOUSAND,
I GUESS.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.585
THEY'VE GOT EMBASSIES
IN EVERY COUNTRY NOW.

20:13.671 --> 20:15.582
AND FOR EVERY ONE
OF THEM THAT COMES,

20:15.673 --> 20:17.880
A FEW THOUSAND OF US
TAKE OFF IN THEIR SHIPS

20:17.925 --> 20:19.791

[clicks tongue]

20:19.885 --> 20:21.717

THE ODD THING:

THE FANTASTIC EASE
WITH WHICH

20:23.806 --> 20:25.717
HUMAN BEINGS
MAKE ADJUSTMENTS.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.555
IN A RINKY-DINK
LITTLE CUBICLE

20:33.649 --> 20:35.981
AND THEY THINK THIS IS
THE MOST HISTORIC MOMENT

20:36.068 --> 20:38.730
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED IN
THE HISTORY OF MANKIND.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.607
AND THEN,
ONE YEAR LATER,

20:40.698 --> 20:42.609
THEY STAND IN LINE

20:42.700 --> 20:44.611
WAITING TO TAKE OFF
IN A SPACESHIP

20:44.702 --> 20:48.616
TO GO 1OO BILLION
MILES OFF INTO SPACE,

20:48.706 --> 20:51.619

ACT AND REACT

YOU, PATTY?

21:18.527 --> 21:20.564
I'M ON
THE LIST, TOO.

21:20.654 --> 21:22.782
THE TROUBLE IS,
THEIR QUOTAS FILL

21:22.865 --> 21:24.401
JUST AS SOON
AS THEY MAKE

21:24.492 --> 21:26.074
THE ANNOUNCEMENT
OF A NEW TRIP.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.616
WHILE I'M WAITING,

I THINK I'LL DO THE
NEXT BEST THING.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.791
I'M STILL WORKING
ON THAT BOOK.

21:31.874 --> 21:34.787
DECIPHERING THAT TITLE
HAS BEEN OF NO HELP

21:34.877 --> 21:37.209
BECAUSE THEIR CAPITAL
LETTERS ARE DIFFERENT

21:37.296 --> 21:38.798
THAN THE OTHER
SIGNS THEY USE,

21:38.881 --> 21:40.337
JUST AS OURS ARE.

21:40.424 --> 21:42.916
BUT IT'S STARTING
TO FALL INTO PLACE.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.297
I THINK I'LL GET THE
ANSWER EVENTUALLY.
