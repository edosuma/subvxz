GOD IS CRYING.

REALLY SAYING?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.100
SHE'S SAYING...

09:26.233 --> 09:27.834
SHE WOULDN'T HURT YOU.

09:29.300 --> 09:30.834
READY?

09:30.834 --> 09:32.567
YEAH.

09:32.567 --> 09:34.000
MOM, DAD.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.100
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.567
HAVE A TIME.

09:37.567 --> 09:39.367
SHAWN?

09:39.367 --> 09:41.100
LAUREN?

09:41.100 --> 09:42.700
SHAWN?

09:44.400 --> 09:46.200
HAVE HIM HOME
BY MIDNIGHT.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.400
NOT A MINUTE AFTER.

09:59.300 --> 10:00.767
I LIKE HER.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.300
I LIKE HER.

10:02.300 --> 10:04.500
I LIKE HER, TOO.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.600
SO YOU WANT TO LIVE
IN A COTTAGE, HUH?

10:16.600 --> 10:19.300
YEAH. A LITTLE WOOD HOUSE.
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

10:19.300 --> 10:21.100
THAT'S IT?

10:21.100 --> 10:23.700
YOU DON'T WANT
A BIG BRICK HOUSE
IN THE SUBURBS

10:23.700 --> 10:26.700
WITH WALK-IN CLOSETS
AND A SKYLIGHT
OVER THE JACUZZI?

10:26.700 --> 10:28.367
WHO WOULD WANT
ANY OF THAT?

10:28.367 --> 10:30.600
NOBODY.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.400
NO, I JUST...

10:32.400 --> 10:33.667
WANT TO BE IN LOVE
WITH SOMEONE

10:33.667 --> 10:35.700
AND MAYBE HAVE
SOME KIDS SOMEDAY.

10:35.700 --> 10:38.233
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE KIDS?

10:38.233 --> 10:40.033
YEAH, BUT I HAVE TO
BE HOME BY MIDNIGHT.

10:40.033 --> 10:43.400
NO, I DO.

10:43.400 --> 10:48.467
SO, I-I'M NOT THE WILD
AND RECKLESS GUY
YOU THOUGHT I WAS, HUH?

10:48.467 --> 10:50.133
IT'S NOT WHAT
I'M LOOKING FOR.

10:50.133 --> 10:51.800
I'VE MET
TOO MANY OF THEM:

10:51.800 --> 10:53.300
ALL TALK, NOTHING REAL,

10:53.300 --> 10:55.100
SLICK AND BORING.

10:55.100 --> 10:56.767
YEAH, TOPANGA
ALWAYS SAYS

10:56.767 --> 10:58.100
THE REASON THAT I...

10:59.567 --> 11:01.033
SORRY.

11:01.033 --> 11:02.300
IT'S OK.

11:02.300 --> 11:04.033
SHE'S A BIG PART
OF YOUR LIFE.

11:04.033 --> 11:07.400
YEAH, SHE IS.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.400
HA! IT'S RAINING.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.100
HERE, LET'S GET INSIDE
SOMEWHERE.

11:12.100 --> 11:14.767
NO, NO, NO.
LET'S NOT.

11:14.767 --> 11:16.133
BUT I-I'M NOT
THE KIND OF GUY

11:16.133 --> 11:17.667
WHO STANDS OUT
IN THE RAIN

11:17.667 --> 11:19.133
WITHOUT
THE APPROPRIATE
OUTERWEAR.

11:19.133 --> 11:21.300
LET ME KEEP YOU
WARM AND DRY.

11:23.467 --> 11:25.667
SO YOU GOT ANY FILM
YOU NEED DEVELOPED?

11:25.667 --> 11:27.567
I LOVE THE RAIN!

11:27.567 --> 11:30.767
YEAH. I DO, TOO, NOW.

11:30.767 --> 11:31.900
YOU DO?

11:31.900 --> 11:34.934
'CAUSE I GOT YOUR RAIN
RIGHT HERE.

11:34.934 --> 11:36.500
AAH!

11:36.500 --> 11:38.867
OHH! GOOD, GOOD.

11:38.867 --> 11:40.867
AAH! HA HA HA!

11:40.867 --> 11:42.600
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.367
COME HERE.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.867
YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT SOMETHING,
AREN'T YOU?

11:55.867 --> 11:57.600
YEAH.

11:59.767 --> 12:02.400
AREN'T YOU HAVING
FUN WITH ME?

12:02.400 --> 12:04.967
THAT'S WHAT
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

12:13.367 --> 12:14.834
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

12:19.800 --> 12:20.967
I HAD A GOOD TIME.

12:20.967 --> 12:23.367
CORY, YOU'RE
SOAKING WET.

12:23.367 --> 12:26.800
I WENT OUT WITH LAUREN.
WE HAD FUN.

12:26.800 --> 12:30.700
I HAD FUN WITH A GIRL
WHO ISN'T TOPANGA.

12:30.700 --> 12:32.400
YOU GOT A TOUGH CHOICE
TO MAKE HERE.

12:32.400 --> 12:36.867
WE ARE GOING TO DECIDE
THIS SCIENTIFICALLY.

12:36.867 --> 12:38.567
HAND ME THOSE
JELLYBEANS OVER THERE.

12:42.033 --> 12:43.600
AHEM!

12:43.600 --> 12:45.600
FIRST OFF,
PERSONALITY.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.867
WHICH GIRL
MAKES YOU LAUGH?

12:47.867 --> 12:50.467
WE'RE NOT GONNA DECIDE
THE REST OF MY LIFE

12:50.467 --> 12:52.000
WITH JELLYBEANS, SHAWN.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.300
THEN WHO IS GOING
TO DECIDE THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE, CORY,

12:54.300 --> 12:55.600
YOU?

12:55.600 --> 12:58.033
OK, BUT DON'T USE
THE RED ONES.

12:58.033 --> 13:00.066
I WANT TO EAT THOSE.

13:00.066 --> 13:01.100
WHO MAKES YOU LAUGH?

13:01.100 --> 13:02.967
TOPANGA MAKES ME LAUGH.

13:04.300 --> 13:06.600
BUT, YOU KNOW, LAUREN
MAKES ME LAUGH, TOO.

13:08.834 --> 13:12.667
ALL RIGHT, WHICH GIRL
WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE
DEEP CONVERSATIONS WITH?

13:12.667 --> 13:16.033
WELL, I MEAN, I
CAN TALK TO TOPANGA
ABOUT ANYTHING.

13:17.734 --> 13:21.300
BUT I LIKE TALKING
TO LAUREN ALSO.

13:23.100 --> 13:24.600
ALL RIGHT...

13:24.600 --> 13:26.100
HONESTY.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.800
YOU CAN TRUST HER.
VERY KEY.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.100
VERY KEY.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.500
WELL, TOPANGA'S
THE MOST HONEST PERSON

13:31.500 --> 13:32.834
I'VE EVER MET.

13:32.834 --> 13:35.400
THAT'S A DOUBLE BEANER,
AND I'M GONNA USE RED.

13:35.400 --> 13:38.467
BUT LAUREN HAS BEEN
HONEST WITH ME, SHAWN,

13:38.467 --> 13:40.200
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.500
OK. OK.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.800
NOW I'M GONNA
ASK YOU A VERY
IMPORTANT QUESTION.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.934
WHO'S GOT
THE BETTER...

13:50.934 --> 13:51.900
YOU KNOW.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.800
WHO'S GOT
THE PERFUME GOING?

13:53.800 --> 13:55.967
WHO DO YOU

13:55.967 --> 13:57.834
[DIRTY LAUGH]

13:59.300 --> 14:02.033
OH, YOU MEAN...
[DIRTY LAUGH]

14:03.734 --> 14:05.300
WELL, THERE'S ONLY
ONE TOPANGA,

14:05.300 --> 14:06.600
AND SHE'S GOT
THE HA HA HA

14:06.600 --> 14:08.200
WITH THE RAH RAH
AND THE HOCKITY HOCKITY.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.467
OH, YEAH.

14:09.467 --> 14:11.400
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
LIKE BEING

14:11.400 --> 14:12.667
INSIDE LAUREN'S JACKET.

14:12.667 --> 14:13.600
WHAT?

14:15.233 --> 14:17.100
JUST POUR THE BEANS.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.033
IT'S A TIE.

14:24.033 --> 14:26.133
YOU LIKE LAUREN AS MUCH
AS YOU LIKE TOPANGA,

14:26.133 --> 14:29.200
AND YOU CAN'T LIVE
WITHOUT EITHER OF THEM.

14:29.200 --> 14:32.100
MAYBE THIS
WAS A BAD IDEA.

14:35.734 --> 14:36.900
NO.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.033
NO, THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA.

14:40.734 --> 14:43.100
SHAWN, YEAH...

14:43.100 --> 14:45.100
I LIKE LAUREN.

14:45.100 --> 14:47.700
I LIKE SPENDING
TIME WITH HER.

14:49.767 --> 14:51.400
BUT I CAN LIVE
WITHOUT HER.

14:53.600 --> 14:56.834
I--I CAN'T LIVE
WITHOUT TOPANGA.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.200
IT'S NO CONTEST.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.100
ALL RIGHT,
RAJ, YOUR TURN.

15:11.100 --> 15:12.500
WHAT DO YOU GOT,
BABE?

15:12.500 --> 15:14.934
I'M LUCKY ENOUGH
TO HAVE PICKED AN ACE.

15:14.934 --> 15:19.033
OOH, AN ACE. OK,
CATEGORY IS POP CULTURE.

VERY NICE.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.867
DO NOTHING!

15:30.400 --> 15:33.367
I SAID ALL I WANTED
YOU TO DO WAS NOTHING.

15:33.367 --> 15:36.300
JUST WATCH THEM
TAKE THE TEST.

15:36.300 --> 15:38.567
OH, NO TESTS.
TORE 'EM UP.

15:38.567 --> 15:40.200
YOU WHAT?

15:40.200 --> 15:41.800
I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU WERE DOING.

15:41.800 --> 15:44.233
YOU WERE TESTING ME,
TO SEE IF I HAD INITIATIVE.

15:44.233 --> 15:46.100
YOU THINK I SHOULD
BE A TEACHER.

15:46.100 --> 15:48.300
NO, I DON'T!

15:48.300 --> 15:50.400

TO PASS OUT THE TEST.

15:57.300 --> 15:58.400
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF TEACHING A CLASS, OK?

15:58.400 --> 15:59.834

15:59.834 --> 16:01.400

OK, THOSE WERE ALL
GOOD ANSWERS, WEREN'T THEY?

16:12.033 --> 16:13.200
EXCEPT FOR
THE DONKEY KONG KING.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.900
BUT, MR. FEENY,
YOU CAN'T PLAY.

16:14.900 --> 16:16.033
YOU'RE ALREADY
A CITIZEN, OK?

16:16.033 --> 16:18.100
ALL RIGHT, MINH,

ALTHOUGH UNORTHODOX,

16:39.400 --> 16:41.900
I'M VERY IMPRESSED
WITH YOUR

16:41.900 --> 16:42.967
MR. MATTHEWS.

16:42.967 --> 16:44.600
WELL, THANK YOU,
MR. FEENY.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.133
THAT MEANS A LOT
COMING FROM YOU.

16:46.133 --> 16:49.700
YOU KNOW, MR. FEENY,
ALL OF US FROM
DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS

16:49.700 --> 16:51.834
ARE LIKE CARDS IN DECK.

16:51.834 --> 16:55.133
Raj: SOME CARDS ARE RED,
SOME CARDS ARE BLACK,

16:55.133 --> 16:56.734
SOME ARE KINGS AND QUEENS,

16:56.734 --> 16:59.300
AND SOME ARE 6s AND 7s,

16:59.300 --> 17:00.967
BUT WITHOUT EVEN
ONE OF THEM,

17:00.967 --> 17:02.734
THE DECK OF CARDS
DOESN'T WORK,

17:02.734 --> 17:05.200
AND THAT'S WHAT
MR. MATTHEWS SAYS
IS AMERICA.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.400
TOPANGA. HI.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.967
I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.
SIT, SIT.

17:16.967 --> 17:19.800
I WANT TO TELL YOU
EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED.

17:19.800 --> 17:22.867
OK, I WENT OUT
WITH LAUREN,

17:22.867 --> 17:24.300
AND I'M NOT GONNA
LIE TO YOU.

17:24.300 --> 17:25.767
WE HAD A GREAT TIME.

17:25.767 --> 17:28.400
WELL, LAUREN'S
A NICE GIRL, CORY.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.600
I KNEW YOU'D HAVE FUN.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.300
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
I WAS ALLOWED TO.

17:32.300 --> 17:35.200
SEE, WHEN I
FIRST MET LAUREN,

17:35.200 --> 17:37.100
SHE WAS THE FIRST GIRL
BESIDES YOU

17:37.100 --> 17:39.100
THAT I EVER THOUGHT
I COULD LIKE.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.367
AND THAT
MADE ME FEEL BAD

17:40.367 --> 17:43.367
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IF I LIKED ANOTHER GIRL,

17:43.367 --> 17:46.100
IT SOMEHOW MEANT
THAT I LIKED YOU LESS.

17:46.100 --> 17:47.867
I'M SORRY YOU FELT BAD.

17:47.867 --> 17:48.967
NO, NO, NO.

17:48.967 --> 17:52.567
BUT IT WAS GOOD THAT
I WENT THROUGH THIS,

17:52.567 --> 17:55.934
BECAUSE
IT TAUGHT ME THAT
LIKING SOMEONE ELSE

17:55.934 --> 17:59.734
COULD NEVER, EVER
TAKE AWAY
FROM LOVING YOU.

17:59.734 --> 18:01.200
AND I DON'T
HAVE TO BE AFRAID

18:01.200 --> 18:02.300
OF WHAT I FEEL
ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE,

18:02.300 --> 18:04.100
BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT IT COULD NEVER

18:04.100 --> 18:06.100
TAKE AWAY
FROM LOVING YOU.

18:06.100 --> 18:08.000
AND I ALWAYS WILL.

18:09.900 --> 18:12.400
AND I KNOW THAT
COMPLETELY NOW.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.867
YOU KNOW THAT NOW?

18:14.867 --> 18:17.200
YEAH.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.600
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME?

18:21.600 --> 18:24.233
LOVE YOU COMPLETELY...
KNOW THAT NOW...

18:24.233 --> 18:25.367
ALWAYS WILL...

18:25.367 --> 18:26.567
NO, THAT'S IT.

18:26.567 --> 18:27.767
SO, UH, LISTEN,

18:27.767 --> 18:29.367
CAN YOU PUT ME
IN YOUR JACKET?

18:29.367 --> 18:30.900
BECAUSE I ONLY WANT
TO BE IN YOUR JACKET.

18:36.367 --> 18:38.000
CORY, I CAN'T
SEE YOU ANYMORE.

18:42.000 --> 18:42.967
WHAT?

18:44.800 --> 18:47.200
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MANY GUYS HIT ON ME?

18:49.233 --> 18:51.033
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

18:53.233 --> 18:56.834
I NEVER NEEDED TO TEST
MY FEELINGS FOR YOU.

18:56.834 --> 18:59.967
I MOVED AWAY
FROM MY PARENTS
IN PITTSBURGH

18:59.967 --> 19:02.000
TO BE CLOSE TO YOU.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.400
EVER SINCE WE
WERE LITTLE KIDS,

19:03.400 --> 19:05.700
I FELT LIKE I BELONGED
WITH YOU AND...

19:07.567 --> 19:09.734
I WOULD'VE GIVEN YOU
EVERYTHING, CORY.

19:11.600 --> 19:12.834
TOPANGA...

19:14.734 --> 19:17.200
I-I'M SO SORRY.

19:25.300 --> 19:26.767
I FORGIVE YOU.

19:29.867 --> 19:32.600
I FORGIVE YOU
FOR LYING AT THE LODGE...

19:32.600 --> 19:34.800
I FORGIVE YOU
FOR KISSING HER...

19:34.800 --> 19:37.200
AND I FORGIVE YOU
FOR THE LETTER,

19:37.200 --> 19:38.867
WHICH I READ.

19:38.867 --> 19:40.033
AND I...

19:40.033 --> 19:42.667
I KNOW HOW INTIMATELY
SHE FELT ABOUT YOU.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.033
BUT THAT YOU NEEDED
TO SEE HER...

19:48.367 --> 19:50.700
TO TEST HOW YOU FELT
ABOUT ME...

19:50.700 --> 19:52.600
I DON'T FORGIVE YOU
FOR THAT.

19:52.600 --> 19:55.200
NO! YOU TOLD ME
TO SEE HER, TOPANGA!

19:55.200 --> 19:57.000
YOU TOLD ME TO SEE
HOW I FELT.

20:02.767 --> 20:04.233
AND YOU LISTENED.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.200
TOPANGA, WHAT'S UP?

20:22.567 --> 20:24.100
IT'S GONNA BE OK.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.734
NO.

20:28.734 --> 20:29.800
NO, IT WON'T.

20:35.467 --> 20:37.567
WE THE PEOPLE
OF THE UNITED STATES,

20:37.567 --> 20:39.800
IN ORDER TO FORM
A MORE PERFECT UNION,

20:39.800 --> 20:44.400
ESTABLISH JUSTICE,
ENSURE DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY...

20:44.400 --> 20:46.000
SECURE THE BLESSINGS
OF LIBERTY

20:46.000 --> 20:47.734
TO OURSELVES
AND OUR POSTERITY,

20:47.734 --> 20:50.567
TO ORDAIN AND ESTABLISH
THIS CONSTITUTION

20:50.567 --> 20:52.200
FOR THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA.

20:52.200 --> 20:54.400
WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS
TO BE SELF-EVIDENT,

20:54.400 --> 20:56.667
THAT ALL MEN
ARE CREATED EQUAL,

20:56.667 --> 20:59.600
AND THEY ARE ENDOWED
BY THEIR CREATOR

20:59.600 --> 21:01.367
WITH CERTAIN
UNALIENABLE RIGHTS;

21:01.367 --> 21:04.800
THAT AMONG THESE
ARE LIFE, LIBERTY,

21:04.800 --> 21:06.734
AND THE PURSUIT
OF HAPPINESS.

21:10.667 --> 21:13.967
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD
WHY ANYBODY WOULD
WANT TO BE A TEACHER

21:13.967 --> 21:15.500
UNTIL NOW.

21:15.500 --> 21:18.600
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE
SEEING YOUR STUDENTS
SUCCEED AND GROW

21:18.600 --> 21:20.600
RIGHT IN FRONT
OF YOUR EYES.

21:20.600 --> 21:23.100
MAKES YOU FEEL SO PROUD
TO KNOW YOU
MADE A DIFFERENCE

21:23.100 --> 21:25.300
IN SOMEBODY'S LIFE,
DOESN'T IT, MR. FEENY?

21:25.300 --> 21:27.500
YES, IT DOES, MY BOY.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.734
INDEED IT DOES.
