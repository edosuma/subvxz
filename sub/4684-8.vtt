WEBVTT

00:01.700 --> 00:05.033
No, no, no,
don't touch that dial.

00:05.100 --> 00:07.933
Here's what's
on my mind tonight.

00:10.333 --> 00:11.700
Jack's got a problem.

00:11.766 --> 00:13.333
'The old man
busted out this morning.'

00:13.400 --> 00:15.666
His father's paying a visit.

00:15.733 --> 00:16.700
Daddy's home.

00:16.766 --> 00:18.000
You know, they never

00:18.066 --> 00:19.633
really got along.

00:19.700 --> 00:22.466
I wouldn't think twice
about blowing you away.

00:22.533 --> 00:26.066
Daddy's out of prison.
But will Jack ever be free?

00:26.133 --> 00:28.766
They said that breaking out
is hard to do.

00:28.833 --> 00:30.866
Hm, not for me, it isn't.

00:30.933 --> 00:34.700
Find out on the next
"Freddy's Nightmares".

00:55.100 --> 00:57.666
You're in Springwood now

00:57.733 --> 00:59.633
and you're all mine!

01:23.700 --> 01:25.900
'In local news,
the grand jury decided today'

01:25.966 --> 01:27.366
'that no indictments
will be handed out'

01:27.433 --> 01:28.966
'in the fiery death
of child murderer'

01:29.033 --> 01:30.400
'Freddy Krueger.'

01:30.466 --> 01:32.366
'Springwood should rest
easier tonight.'

01:32.433 --> 01:34.866
'That's the last
we'll hear about that guy.'

01:34.933 --> 01:36.400
'Springwood bank robber,
Woody Burton'

01:36.466 --> 01:38.266
'escaped this morning
from the federal penitentiary'

01:38.333 --> 01:41.000
'in running creek,
200 miles from Springwood.'

01:41.066 --> 01:43.633
'Police have reported no leads
as to Burton's whereabouts.'

01:43.700 --> 01:46.533
'That's news
at the top of the hour.'

01:55.300 --> 01:58.133
Oh, uh...W-Woody promised

01:58.200 --> 02:00.366
to stay out of trouble, officer.

02:00.433 --> 02:01.600
I-I-I don't know where he is.

02:01.666 --> 02:03.733
He's not home,
but we're supposed to go

02:03.800 --> 02:05.966
to the Grand Canyon.

02:06.033 --> 02:08.000
Grand Canyon?

02:08.066 --> 02:09.233
He's headed
for the Grand Canyon?

02:09.300 --> 02:10.900
Oh, no, Woody wouldn't go

02:10.966 --> 02:12.766
to Grand Canyon without me

02:12.833 --> 02:15.033
Mrs. Burton, your husband broke
out of prison this morning.

02:15.100 --> 02:17.866
Have you talked to him recently?

02:17.933 --> 02:19.766
I haven't seen Woody
in a long time.

02:19.833 --> 02:21.766
Oh. Well, I, uh

02:21.833 --> 02:24.133
wanted you to be aware
that he broke out.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.700
I know your husband's been
a little...rough on you

02:26.766 --> 02:28.633
in the past, so..

02:28.700 --> 02:30.900
...like you to call us
if you do hear from him

02:30.966 --> 02:34.000
before anyone gets hurt,
so there'll be

02:34.066 --> 02:37.900
someone watching the house,
so you, uh..

02:39.966 --> 02:42.833
Right.
Goodnight, ma'am.

03:07.166 --> 03:10.966
Hey, warden!
Let me out of here. Come on!

03:11.033 --> 03:14.733
You promised me some good time
if I behave.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.066
Hmm.

03:17.133 --> 03:19.900
Breakin' out is hard to do..

03:20.733 --> 03:23.033
...but not for me.

03:29.300 --> 03:33.166
Come home, Woody, please.

03:33.233 --> 03:34.800
Please come home.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.033
I don't know, there's something
about this dress.

03:47.100 --> 03:49.433
Stand up.

03:51.966 --> 03:54.000
Turn around.

03:57.333 --> 03:59.433
Yeah, I know
what I like about it.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.500
I can practically see
right through it.

04:01.566 --> 04:03.600
Woody.

04:08.966 --> 04:10.833
You know,
when I'm with you, Joyce

04:10.900 --> 04:13.633
I feel like nothing
possibly could go wrong.

04:13.700 --> 04:16.800
Woody, I want us
to be together forever.

04:16.866 --> 04:19.733
Count on it.
It's you and me always.

04:20.933 --> 04:22.900
How does that sound?

04:23.766 --> 04:26.100
Miss Burton?

04:35.600 --> 04:37.533
'Ma.'

04:38.633 --> 04:40.166
'Ma.'

04:40.233 --> 04:42.533
'Ma, you okay?'

04:42.600 --> 04:44.866
- 'Ma, you..'
- Woody. Woody.

04:44.933 --> 04:47.766
Ma, he's in jail.
I'm Jack, your son.

04:47.833 --> 04:50.833
You ready?
We're going to the Grand Canyon.

04:50.900 --> 04:53.200
Come on, ma, not this again,
we're not going anywhere.

04:55.433 --> 04:56.833
Oh, you..

04:56.900 --> 04:59.533
You just look
so like your father.

05:02.300 --> 05:04.933
I know, you told me that
a million times.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.766
Look, I'm sorry I woke you up.

05:06.833 --> 05:08.733
Woody's coming home.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.166
No, he's not, ma.

05:10.233 --> 05:12.200
He's in jail,
he robbed a bank, remember?

05:13.333 --> 05:15.566
I should make him beef stew.

05:15.633 --> 05:17.700
He loves beef stew.

05:18.766 --> 05:21.233
It's gonna be
just the way it was.

05:23.566 --> 05:25.600
Do you remember
the way it was, ma?

05:25.666 --> 05:27.800
Can you really remember?

05:29.166 --> 05:32.033
We'll be a family again.

05:32.100 --> 05:34.233
We were never a family.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.500
Woody..

05:39.133 --> 05:41.100
Right.

05:42.366 --> 05:44.500
I'll see you in the morning,
get some sleep.

06:11.233 --> 06:12.866
What do you want?

06:12.933 --> 06:14.833
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

06:15.966 --> 06:18.133
You sound guilty as hell to me.

06:19.233 --> 06:20.800
Maybe because
I know you so well.

06:20.866 --> 06:22.566
Hey, I've kept my nose clean.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.933
For now. Yeah.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.600
I guess reform school
was good for something.

06:27.666 --> 06:30.000
You got a warrant? If not,
get the hell out of here.

06:30.066 --> 06:32.233
What? I need a warrant
to use the bathroom?

06:32.300 --> 06:34.400
The bathroom? Go use the bushes.

06:34.466 --> 06:36.533
- What the hell are you doing?
- We're watching your house.

06:37.933 --> 06:39.866
Look, since you're so damn sure
that I did something

06:39.933 --> 06:41.500
why don't you guys
just arrest me now

06:41.566 --> 06:42.666
and let's get this over with.

06:42.733 --> 06:43.666
You?

06:45.666 --> 06:47.566
We're not here for you.

06:47.633 --> 06:49.600
We're looking for your old man.

06:51.966 --> 06:54.233
'Don't you people
talk in this house?'

06:54.300 --> 06:56.433
'Your old man
busted out this morning.'

06:57.566 --> 06:58.833
What makes you think
he'd come here?

06:58.900 --> 07:00.066
It's his house, isn't it?

07:00.133 --> 07:02.200
- You're his family.
- Family. Yeah, right.

07:02.266 --> 07:03.600
Let me set you straight.

07:03.666 --> 07:06.033
The only reason why he'd come
here is if he wanted something.

07:06.100 --> 07:08.600
Well, that's exactly
what we were thinking.

07:10.866 --> 07:13.566
We never found
the money from that bank job.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.400
He's probably too smart
for that, he's probably got it

07:15.466 --> 07:18.133
stashed in some bank in Mexico.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.033
Or maybe he had it
in his cell with him.

07:20.100 --> 07:22.033
How closely did you guys look?

07:23.500 --> 07:24.666
Yeah, well.

07:24.733 --> 07:27.000
Thanks anyway for letting me
use your bathroom.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.500
Call me if you
hear anything, Jack.

07:31.833 --> 07:34.633
Or if you wanna turn
yourself in for any reason.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.000
Alright.

08:12.500 --> 08:14.166
Hello.

08:14.233 --> 08:16.666
Maggie.

08:16.733 --> 08:18.433
No, I can't.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.000
Maggie, it's not that
I don't wanna spend the night.

08:20.066 --> 08:21.200
I can't.

08:21.266 --> 08:23.100
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.

08:23.166 --> 08:25.000
Yeah, I love you too.

08:25.066 --> 08:27.033
Bye.

08:29.233 --> 08:32.666
'The cartel has vowed to boost
oil production anyway.'

08:32.733 --> 08:35.266
'In local news, escaped
bank robber Woody Burton'

08:35.333 --> 08:37.600
'was sighted earlier
this evening in Harrow.'

08:37.666 --> 08:41.000
'Police there say that he robbed
a gas station and stole a car.'

08:41.066 --> 08:44.400
'So far, Burton has
successfully eluded police.'

08:46.533 --> 08:48.933
Harrow, that's
less than 40 miles away.

09:18.066 --> 09:21.833
If you're ever gonna get
the drop on me, Jackie boy

09:21.900 --> 09:24.400
you're gonna have to
at least stay awake.

09:25.700 --> 09:29.200
Now, where's my money?
It's not where I left it.

09:29.266 --> 09:31.133
How should I know? You're
the one that robbed the bank.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.200
What do you think,
I'm playing with you?

09:33.266 --> 09:35.600
You think this is a game?

09:37.166 --> 09:40.066
Woody, you're home.

09:40.133 --> 09:41.866
Where's my money?

09:41.933 --> 09:43.100
She doesn't know,
leave her alone.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.100
Shut up.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.700
Woody, it's so good

09:45.766 --> 09:47.033
to have you back!

09:50.266 --> 09:52.533
It's great to be back, babe.

10:05.333 --> 10:07.533
The money. The money..

10:07.600 --> 10:09.533
Where would he put the money?

10:13.433 --> 10:15.800
Where is he?

10:18.366 --> 10:19.766
'Where is that little bastard?'

10:19.833 --> 10:22.766
'Woody, please,
he didn't steal your watch.'

10:22.833 --> 10:24.033
'Oh, then where is it?'

10:24.100 --> 10:25.600
I gave it to him.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.333
I am tired of you defending him.

10:40.133 --> 10:42.700
Now I gotta fix the step.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.333
Now I gotta fix the step.

11:01.866 --> 11:04.666
Fix the step.

11:55.433 --> 11:57.100
Daddy's home.

11:57.166 --> 11:58.100
Hey!

11:58.166 --> 12:00.266
Hey, where you going?

12:00.333 --> 12:02.333
'Aren't you glad to see me?'

12:02.400 --> 12:04.066
Don't you have
a kiss for your old man

12:04.133 --> 12:06.433
after all this time?

12:06.500 --> 12:08.600
Huh?

12:09.966 --> 12:12.500
Listen to me, Jackie boy.

12:12.566 --> 12:15.800
You're gonna do
exactly what I tell you.

12:15.866 --> 12:17.966
'Cause you know
I wouldn't think twice

12:18.033 --> 12:20.000
about blowing you away.

12:21.233 --> 12:23.400
'Where's your mother?'

12:26.900 --> 12:28.400
Good.

12:28.466 --> 12:31.133
I want her
to stay there.C

12:35.433 --> 12:38.200
Get me a screwdriver.

12:38.266 --> 12:40.233
Now.

12:42.066 --> 12:45.200
Hey, you're working out, huh?

12:45.266 --> 12:47.533
Hey, I used to work out
when I was a kid too.

12:48.633 --> 12:50.900
Yeah.

12:50.966 --> 12:54.133
It all seems kinda wasted
on you though, Jackie boy.

12:58.766 --> 13:00.500
There's some home improvement
I've been waiting

13:00.566 --> 13:03.033
to take care of
for about 10 years.

13:06.033 --> 13:08.033
Come here.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.133
You sit down here where
I can keep an eye on you.

13:11.566 --> 13:14.033
I don't want
any trouble from you.

13:18.433 --> 13:20.833
You and me..

13:20.900 --> 13:22.400
...we were never..

13:22.466 --> 13:24.400
...friends or anything, were we?

13:27.433 --> 13:29.533
I guess that's because..

13:31.833 --> 13:33.900
...I never really wanted you.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.266
'It's nothing personal,
Jackie boy'

13:37.333 --> 13:39.033
I just..

13:39.100 --> 13:41.133
...don't like kids.

13:41.700 --> 13:43.733
Even my own.

13:49.433 --> 13:51.233
Of course, you were never..

13:52.233 --> 13:54.266
...a member of my..

13:54.333 --> 13:55.866
...fan club, either, were you?

14:02.966 --> 14:05.166
Were you?

14:05.233 --> 14:07.533
- No.
- No?

14:12.400 --> 14:14.866
'Why do people have kids?'

14:14.933 --> 14:17.600
'It's so stupid.
Waste of time.'

14:18.433 --> 14:20.900
Do we have company?

14:24.266 --> 14:26.600
Woody. Oh, Woody!

14:26.666 --> 14:29.366
I knew you would come home!

14:29.433 --> 14:32.866
Oh, Woody,
I have missed you so much.

14:32.933 --> 14:34.600
Oh, Woody. Woody.

14:34.666 --> 14:37.100
I, uh, didn't-didn't know that

14:37.166 --> 14:39.633
you'd be so glad to see me
after all this time.

14:39.700 --> 14:42.366
No, no, I never
stopped thinking about you

14:42.433 --> 14:44.700
Oh, never. Never.

14:44.766 --> 14:46.766
'Oh, do you know what?'

14:46.833 --> 14:50.200
We still could take
that trip to the Grand Canyon.

14:50.266 --> 14:52.900
It won't take me
long at all to get ready.

14:53.700 --> 14:56.533
You wait right there.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.433
Oh, he's come back!

14:58.500 --> 15:01.066
'Oh, he's come back.'

15:01.133 --> 15:03.333
What the hell is wrong with her?

15:03.400 --> 15:05.800
You oughta know.
You threw her down the stairs.

15:07.566 --> 15:10.133
I didn't throw her
down the stairs.

15:11.766 --> 15:14.200
As I remember it,
we were arguing about you.

15:15.866 --> 15:18.000
It's your fault, Jackie boy.

15:23.300 --> 15:25.233
I didn't throw her.

15:32.333 --> 15:34.300
Where is it?

15:35.300 --> 15:37.233
Where...is it?

15:37.300 --> 15:39.033
- Where's what?
- The money.

15:39.100 --> 15:40.466
Where's the money, pal?

15:40.533 --> 15:42.233
I've been waiting
for that money for 10 years.

15:42.300 --> 15:43.333
Now you tell me where it is.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.733
Look, I don't know where it is.

15:49.033 --> 15:50.900
- I'll wait.
- Wait for what?

15:50.966 --> 15:53.166
I'll wait for you to tell me..

15:53.233 --> 15:55.233
...where it is.

15:55.300 --> 15:58.233
Or for me
to lose my patience with you.

16:19.300 --> 16:21.933
I can't believe you,
I told you no kids!

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
- Now we're finished.
- Woody, please, wait..

16:24.066 --> 16:25.366
You just keep away from me

16:25.433 --> 16:28.433
I'm sorry,
I don't want kids either.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.600
You're right, I don't know
what I was thinking.

16:30.666 --> 16:33.800
I mean...we don't need kids.

16:33.866 --> 16:36.266
I don't want them.

16:36.333 --> 16:38.100
I mean it.

16:38.166 --> 16:40.400
I don't even
wanna talk about kids.

16:40.466 --> 16:42.866
They just tie us down.

16:42.933 --> 16:46.233
Look, I don't need anybody else
when I've got you.

16:47.333 --> 16:49.266
Do you need anybody else?

16:49.333 --> 16:51.266
No.

16:51.333 --> 16:53.233
Okay, then this how it is.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.933
I don't wanna share you.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.233
Especially not with a kid.

17:21.100 --> 17:22.300
Time's up.

17:22.366 --> 17:24.466
Oh, whose time
are we talking about?

17:24.533 --> 17:26.233
Don't you think
the cops are gonna miss Webb?

17:26.300 --> 17:29.033
Do I look worried, Jackie boy?

17:30.066 --> 17:32.233
You got your memory back?

17:33.633 --> 17:36.566
Oh, it's too bad.

17:36.633 --> 17:38.700
'Cause I'm gonna find it

17:38.766 --> 17:40.800
one way or another.

17:42.033 --> 17:43.900
How do I look, Woody?

17:43.966 --> 17:45.266
How do I look?

17:45.333 --> 17:47.200
I just bought this for the trip.

17:47.266 --> 17:50.433
We don't have any kids to
hold us back so we can just go.

17:51.500 --> 17:54.266
I found this
wonderful hotel in here.

17:54.333 --> 17:56.633
It's not far
from the Grand Canyon.

17:56.700 --> 18:00.000
And it sounds
so peaceful and it looks so..

18:00.066 --> 18:02.300
...romantic. Well..

18:02.366 --> 18:04.133
I bought a new hat today.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.133
'I hope you like it.'

18:07.266 --> 18:10.266
Ma, go back to bed.

18:10.333 --> 18:12.866
I bought it just for you.

18:12.933 --> 18:14.833
Ma, take your damn hat
and get back to bed!

18:14.900 --> 18:16.400
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

18:16.466 --> 18:18.500
Your mother
wants to show me a new hat.

18:18.566 --> 18:21.000
Let her show it to me.

18:21.066 --> 18:23.533
...bought it just for you.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.566
Now..

18:29.633 --> 18:31.700
...how does it look?

18:34.366 --> 18:37.033
'You never looked better, babe.'

18:38.533 --> 18:40.166
'You really think so?'

18:40.233 --> 18:43.733
I'll just be two minutes
and I'll be ready for the trip.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.133
Now how do you suppose
that money

18:50.200 --> 18:52.466
got from there to here?

18:52.533 --> 18:55.033
You little thief,
I oughta blow your head off.

18:55.100 --> 18:57.033
Oh, yeah,
you think you're so tough.

18:57.100 --> 18:59.366
Get it over with!
Then you could go shoot her!

18:59.433 --> 19:01.966
You're not
worth a bullet, you punk.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.933
I'm ready to go, honey.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.566
I've always wanted
to take that donkey ride.

19:51.633 --> 19:54.133
The one right down
into the canyon

19:54.200 --> 19:56.733
along the trails, you think
that you were gonna fall

19:56.800 --> 19:58.233
right into the canyon.

19:58.300 --> 20:00.466
Will you shut up?

20:00.533 --> 20:02.200
Maybe another smack in the head

20:02.266 --> 20:04.600
is what you need
to set you right.

20:09.566 --> 20:11.766
It's good cover.

20:11.833 --> 20:13.333
Driving with a woman,
they're not gonna be

20:13.400 --> 20:15.333
looking for that.

20:19.500 --> 20:20.933
I gotta figure out what to do.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.200
Where I'm gonna
dump these bodies.

20:23.266 --> 20:25.433
You really should
look at this, Woody.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.233
I mean, this is beautiful.

20:27.300 --> 20:30.333
You see.. And right here,
it says that all you..

20:30.400 --> 20:33.000
Will you shut up?

21:55.766 --> 21:57.900
Stupid kid.

21:57.966 --> 22:00.600
Making a move on me.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.100
It was right here in this field.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.100
She promised me..

22:22.166 --> 22:24.100
...no kids.

22:28.700 --> 22:31.033
'I should've done this
a long time ago.'

22:46.333 --> 22:48.300
Son of a bitch!

22:56.233 --> 22:59.200
...manylovely&lt;row

22:59.266 --> 23:02.500
Oh, wonder if we should stop
and make a reservation.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.200
I think ribs would be nice.

23:05.266 --> 23:08.700
Yes, ribs would be
very nice for lunch.

23:08.766 --> 23:12.266
Oh. Ah!
And how about this hotel?

23:12.333 --> 23:14.900
It says that
they have this wonderful

23:14.966 --> 23:17.433
wonderful view of the sunrise

23:17.500 --> 23:19.766
over the canyon. Oh..

23:19.833 --> 23:22.033
What do you think, Woody,
would you like that?

23:22.933 --> 23:24.933
How about we just go home, ma?

23:26.466 --> 23:29.000
I hope you won't be
upset with me, Woody.

23:29.066 --> 23:31.233
We're gonna have a baby.

23:31.300 --> 23:33.600
But we can still go on our trip.

23:35.200 --> 23:36.933
It's okay, ma.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.233
It's all over.

23:39.300 --> 23:41.433
We're going home now.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.900
I hope it's a boy.

23:43.966 --> 23:46.600
Wonder what he's gonna be like.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.866
'On the local front,
Jack Burton'

23:55.933 --> 23:58.000
'was exonerated today in the
shooting death of his father'

23:58.066 --> 24:00.000
'escaped bank robber,
Woody Burton.'

24:00.066 --> 24:01.400
'Authorities
have also determined'

24:01.466 --> 24:03.500
'that Woody Burton killed
Springwood police officer'

24:03.566 --> 24:04.600
'Alphonse Webb.'

24:04.666 --> 24:06.766
'At this point
the money from the bank robbery'

24:06.833 --> 24:08.800
'remains unaccounted for.'

24:09.433 --> 24:10.733
Yeah.

24:10.800 --> 24:14.100
That Woody, he had
the right idea about kids.

24:14.166 --> 24:16.100
He just didn't go far enough.

24:16.900 --> 24:18.833
I hate kids.

24:18.900 --> 24:21.500
I've got the perfect form
of birth control.

24:26.700 --> 24:27.933
One tablet..

24:28.000 --> 24:30.900
...lasts a whole lifetime.

24:55.266 --> 24:57.200
No!

24:57.266 --> 24:58.566
Get out of there.

24:58.633 --> 25:00.633
You know better than that.

25:06.133 --> 25:08.433
Maggie, meet your
new daughter Patty.

25:15.533 --> 25:17.500
She's tiny.

25:19.233 --> 25:21.200
Mm, not for long.
Here, hold her.

25:27.166 --> 25:29.266
Oh, you look good together

25:29.333 --> 25:31.300
She's beautiful, Jack.

25:33.133 --> 25:35.300
Who are her parents?

25:35.366 --> 25:36.900
It doesn't matter,
she's healthy.

25:36.966 --> 25:39.233
Look how cute she is,
she even looks like you.

25:39.300 --> 25:42.433
Yeah, we both have
two eyes and a nose.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.566
But who are her parents?

25:44.633 --> 25:46.400
Are they from Springwood?
Were they married or--

25:46.466 --> 25:48.400
Come on, I told you
all about this.

25:48.466 --> 25:50.800
It's none of our business.

25:50.866 --> 25:52.866
We take the baby,
no questions asked.

25:52.933 --> 25:54.233
That's the deal.

25:54.300 --> 25:57.000
Yeah, I know.

25:57.066 --> 26:00.366
I guess, I just didn't think
it would feel so..

26:00.433 --> 26:02.433
...unsavory.

26:04.100 --> 26:06.200
Look, she's got a nice home

26:06.266 --> 26:07.900
with loving parents.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.400
I'm sorry.

26:10.466 --> 26:13.066
I-it's my fault anyway, it's..

26:13.133 --> 26:14.766
No one's at fault.

26:14.833 --> 26:16.933
It's-i-it's wrong
to spend money on a baby

26:17.000 --> 26:18.533
e-especially that money.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.333
Look, that money
was the only good thing

26:20.400 --> 26:23.266
that ever came out
of my father's rotten life.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.300
Besides, no one ever knew
it was stolen.

26:26.100 --> 26:28.066
And they never will.

26:28.133 --> 26:30.233
Besides, what choice
did we have?

26:30.300 --> 26:31.500
'Bad enough I can't conceive'

26:31.566 --> 26:33.466
'but we can't
even adopt legitimately.'

26:33.533 --> 26:36.333
No agency's is interested
in a father that has had

26:36.400 --> 26:37.933
problems with the law.

26:38.933 --> 26:40.000
They don't think
you could ever change

26:40.066 --> 26:41.000
well, they're wrong.

26:41.066 --> 26:43.666
Now we have our own family.

26:43.733 --> 26:46.600
This was all supposed
to be so perfect.

26:46.666 --> 26:48.133
I didn't think
I'd feel this way.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.433
I need to&lt;TO3
who her parents are!

26:50.500 --> 26:52.500
I need to know
what her background is

26:52.566 --> 26:56.200
is there any medical history
that we should know about.

26:56.266 --> 26:57.333
Look, even if this was a

26:57.400 --> 26:59.000
uh, was a legal adoption

26:59.066 --> 27:00.433
we couldn't know that.

27:00.500 --> 27:01.966
That's for our protection

27:02.033 --> 27:04.700
as well as their protection.

27:04.766 --> 27:07.400
But more importantly
that's for her protection.

27:08.533 --> 27:10.000
The only history we need to know

27:10.066 --> 27:12.033
begins now.

27:12.733 --> 27:14.666
We have a baby.

27:14.733 --> 27:16.700
We love our baby.

27:17.566 --> 27:18.700
We're a family.

27:18.766 --> 27:20.833
Yes, but..

27:20.900 --> 27:22.833
...what kind of a family?

27:25.033 --> 27:27.000
What kind of a family?

27:41.400 --> 27:42.633
'Hmm.'

27:42.700 --> 27:44.800
'Let me see a recipe'

27:44.866 --> 27:47.033
'for a little girl.'

27:47.100 --> 27:48.166
'Sugar.'

27:49.533 --> 27:50.766
'Some spice.'

27:50.833 --> 27:51.833
'Oh, yes.'

27:51.900 --> 27:55.600
And, uh, everything nice.

27:55.666 --> 27:58.800
Ho-o-oh. Hmm.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.533
This could get interesting.

28:04.266 --> 28:05.666
Patty.

28:05.733 --> 28:06.933
Patty?

28:07.000 --> 28:09.833
I don't understand
what you're so upset about, hon.

28:09.900 --> 28:12.066
Our daughter broke
another child's arm.

28:12.133 --> 28:13.900
I don't take
things like that lightly.

28:13.966 --> 28:16.533
And I don't take it lightly
when my child's school principal

28:16.600 --> 28:18.266
looks at me
like I'm the one who did it.

28:18.333 --> 28:19.900
You're reading too much
into these things

28:19.966 --> 28:20.900
they way Patty told it

28:20.966 --> 28:22.633
it was an accident.

28:22.700 --> 28:24.933
That's not the way
it sounded to me.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.466
I-I don't believe this.

28:26.533 --> 28:28.366
The principal told us
the exact same thing

28:28.433 --> 28:30.366
I come away thinking
it was an accident

28:30.433 --> 28:33.100
and you come away
thinking she's a serial killer.

28:33.166 --> 28:36.000
I don't think
she's a serial killer.

28:36.066 --> 28:38.700
I just don't know who she is.

28:39.933 --> 28:41.933
That's the way I feel.

28:42.833 --> 28:44.900
Oh, ma, let me help you.

28:44.966 --> 28:48.200
Did I tell you that
I went skiing the other day?

28:50.433 --> 28:53.433
Oh, Woody, it was so beautiful.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.666
Ma, I'm Jack, your son.

28:56.733 --> 28:58.700
Woody's been dead
for a long time.

29:01.333 --> 29:02.766
Would you keep your cat
off the couch?

29:03.966 --> 29:05.266
Honestly, Jack,
I think your mother

29:05.333 --> 29:06.600
should go back to the home.

29:06.666 --> 29:09.566
'It's hectic enough
around here with one child.'

29:09.633 --> 29:11.233
You're really on a roll.

29:11.300 --> 29:13.000
'Look, she wasn't happy there.'

29:13.066 --> 29:15.033
How could they tell?

29:16.833 --> 29:18.766
I could tell.

29:18.833 --> 29:22.400
You'll excuse me if I feel a
certain responsibility for her.

29:22.466 --> 29:24.600
'She's been back here
for three months.'

29:24.666 --> 29:25.800
'And I still don't feel safe'

29:25.866 --> 29:27.500
'leaving Patty alone with her.'

29:29.166 --> 29:30.600
Do you mind if we don't
have this conversation

29:30.666 --> 29:32.733
right in her face?

29:32.800 --> 29:35.100
Grandma, grandma.

29:35.166 --> 29:37.033
So..

29:37.100 --> 29:38.400
The little red riding hood

29:38.466 --> 29:40.300
and the three bears
went across the street

29:40.366 --> 29:42.066
into the store.

29:42.133 --> 29:44.000
'They just didn't know'

29:44.066 --> 29:46.700
'where you'd gone to. So..'

29:46.766 --> 29:48.733
Tell me again
about the Grand Canyon, grandma.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.666
Oh, well

29:50.733 --> 29:53.300
that&lt;TO2
magnificent trip.

29:53.366 --> 29:55.066
'And you know that we had'

29:55.133 --> 29:57.800
'the most beautiful view
of the sunrise'

29:57.866 --> 30:00.833
and it was right out
of our hotel room.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.066
Yeah, we could see it

30:02.133 --> 30:03.566
right from our room.

30:03.633 --> 30:06.466
'Oh, that wasbeau

30:06.533 --> 30:08.766
This is nuts.
This is nuts!

30:08.833 --> 30:10.900
She's never even been
to the Grand Canyon.

30:28.366 --> 30:30.766
This is an old family recipe.

30:30.833 --> 30:31.866
You take these herbs

30:31.933 --> 30:34.433
and you chop them very fine.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.833
'Can I do that part, grandma?'

30:35.900 --> 30:38.100
Oh, I think
you're doing just fine.

30:38.166 --> 30:39.366
Just fine.

30:39.433 --> 30:42.100
Maybe next time
you'll chop and I'll watch.

30:42.166 --> 30:43.633
My mother taught me this recipe

30:43.700 --> 30:45.200
and now I'm teaching you.

30:45.266 --> 30:46.566
But I can already tell

30:46.633 --> 30:49.233
this is turning out
just perfect.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.800
Hmm.

30:51.866 --> 30:53.666
Celery? Oh, good girl.

30:53.733 --> 30:55.133
'The secret is'

30:55.200 --> 30:57.766
'that you always chop finely'

30:57.833 --> 30:59.800
and perfectly.

32:19.566 --> 32:20.500
'Good morning, Springwood'

32:20.566 --> 32:21.600
'it's Big Q News.'

32:21.666 --> 32:22.966
'Another Springwood
high school co-ed'

32:23.033 --> 32:25.033
'has died mysteriously
in her sleep.'

32:25.100 --> 32:27.466
'Baffled police report
they have no suspects.'

32:27.533 --> 32:29.566
'Springwood's economic picture
is improving'

32:29.633 --> 32:31.100
'in particular
the third mortuary'

32:31.166 --> 32:32.833
'these many months
has opened it's doors.'

32:32.900 --> 32:34.166
'People are moving out,
industry..'

32:34.233 --> 32:36.100
Coffee?

32:36.166 --> 32:38.100
I've thought about this
very carefully, Jack.

32:38.166 --> 32:40.866
I want your mother
to go back to the home.

32:40.933 --> 32:43.300
'...but gusting northeast winds,
will bring areas..'

32:43.366 --> 32:45.600
- Milk?
- I mean it, Jack.

32:45.666 --> 32:48.800
Do you know that she's been
sleeping in Patty's room?

32:48.866 --> 32:50.566
I don't want her
anywhere near Patty.

32:50.633 --> 32:52.133
Look, don't hide behind Patty

32:52.200 --> 32:53.700
this has nothing to do with her.

32:53.766 --> 32:55.566
And I want the name
of that lawyer.

32:55.633 --> 32:56.666
'What lawyer?

32:56.733 --> 32:59.700
The lawyer who helped you
find Patty.

32:59.766 --> 33:01.766
I'll answer your questions.

33:01.833 --> 33:04.000
No to both.

33:04.066 --> 33:05.333
'Look, why do you
have to know now?'

33:05.400 --> 33:07.133
Everything's been fine
for six years

33:07.200 --> 33:08.200
everything's been fine.

33:08.266 --> 33:10.400
Why now?

33:10.466 --> 33:13.433
Because I've been having
these strange dreams.

33:13.500 --> 33:15.633
'And I have to make
contact with her parents.'

33:16.966 --> 33:19.000
Because you've been having
strange dreams?

33:19.066 --> 33:20.600
Yes.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.166
And I know the dreams
are related.

33:22.233 --> 33:24.600
'I have to know
who her parents are.'

33:24.666 --> 33:26.166
I'll tell you
who her parents are.

33:26.233 --> 33:28.833
You're her mother
and I'm her father.

33:28.900 --> 33:31.033
I don't mean that, Jack.

33:31.100 --> 33:33.433
I feel like I don't know her.

33:33.500 --> 33:34.633
I mean, haven't you noticed

33:34.700 --> 33:36.633
'anything strange
about the way she is?'

33:38.233 --> 33:39.566
I just want to know

33:39.633 --> 33:41.600
where she came from.

33:43.900 --> 33:46.266
Okay, I'll make a deal with you.

33:46.333 --> 33:47.400
I'll find out what I can.

33:47.466 --> 33:49.566
But as far as my mother goes

33:49.633 --> 33:52.033
you'll leave her out of this.

33:52.100 --> 33:54.033
Alright.

34:01.933 --> 34:03.733
I'm taking Patty shopping.

34:05.033 --> 34:07.000
By the way, have you seen
the cat this morning?

34:32.600 --> 34:34.566
I can't find Woody anyplace.

34:34.633 --> 34:36.366
I've looked in the covers.

34:36.433 --> 34:38.900
I've looked in the drawers
he just..

34:38.966 --> 34:40.433
And not around.

34:41.733 --> 34:43.566
I don't know how much more
of this I can take.

34:43.633 --> 34:44.733
Maggie.

34:48.800 --> 34:52.033
I know who's Patty's
parents are.

34:58.666 --> 35:00.666
Our Hawaiian vacation fund
is now empty.

35:00.733 --> 35:02.700
I hope you're happy.

35:05.300 --> 35:08.133
That's what this
little piece of paper cost me.

35:08.200 --> 35:10.200
I got the names
of Patty's parents and, uh

35:10.266 --> 35:11.900
where we can find them.

35:11.966 --> 35:13.933
Oh, Jack, thank you.

35:14.700 --> 35:16.133
Thank you so much.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.833
Thank you. Thank you.

35:30.133 --> 35:32.200
Is this the right address?

35:33.366 --> 35:35.133
Let's go in
and meet the Thorns.

35:47.533 --> 35:49.600
'Does this answer
your questions?'

35:51.600 --> 35:53.533
Who are you?

35:55.700 --> 35:57.000
Jack, help me.

36:04.133 --> 36:05.733
Oh, my God.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.500
- 'What is it?'
- 'It's a jackal.'

36:14.400 --> 36:15.700
Jack?

36:17.100 --> 36:19.033
Jack!

36:20.433 --> 36:22.400
Jack!

36:34.600 --> 36:36.700
'Honey, come see
what I've brought home.'

36:36.766 --> 36:38.700
'Patty, picked him out herself.'

36:46.600 --> 36:48.533
She had to have this one,
isn't he cute?

36:56.966 --> 36:58.600
Oh, it's your turn now

36:58.666 --> 37:00.700
so you'll have to
take care of her now.

37:07.233 --> 37:09.200
Shoo!

37:12.200 --> 37:13.533
Go away.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.800
I need to know
who Patty's parents are.

37:31.566 --> 37:32.833
Do you know?

37:36.066 --> 37:38.033
You said you knew, do you?

37:40.500 --> 37:42.433
How do you know?

37:43.766 --> 37:45.700
Answer me!

37:47.266 --> 37:49.200
Who are they?

37:50.100 --> 37:51.500
Who are they?

37:51.566 --> 37:53.866
Who are they?
Who are they?

38:32.600 --> 38:35.033
And that's what happens
to people when they die.

38:36.300 --> 38:40.000
And that's what
happened to grandma.

38:40.066 --> 38:41.533
You understand, sweetheart?

38:43.166 --> 38:44.100
Okay.

38:45.133 --> 38:47.100
It's time to go to bed, alright?

38:53.066 --> 38:55.033
You killed grandma.

38:59.433 --> 39:01.433
No, sweetheart, I didn't.

39:02.800 --> 39:04.300
I tried to help grandma.

39:05.633 --> 39:07.600
'I always try to help grandma.'

39:08.566 --> 39:10.600
You killed her.

39:10.666 --> 39:12.933
No, sweetheart, I didn't, I..

39:13.000 --> 39:15.133
I saw you.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.133
I saw you kill her.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.233
Jack.

39:30.300 --> 39:31.933
You know that I-I did

39:32.000 --> 39:33.500
everything I could

39:33.566 --> 39:35.600
to help your mother..

39:35.666 --> 39:37.433
...right?

39:37.500 --> 39:39.066
I was walking by Patty's room

39:39.133 --> 39:40.833
and she was having a seizure.

39:40.900 --> 39:42.200
I tried to save her, Jack

39:42.266 --> 39:45.000
I-I did everything I could

39:45.066 --> 39:47.033
I know you did, honey,
it's not your fault.

39:49.566 --> 39:52.033
Have you had a chance
to contact that lawyer yet

39:54.633 --> 39:55.933
What? What..

39:56.000 --> 39:57.933
Did you find out anything?
Tell me.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.666
It's better off
that you don't know.

39:59.733 --> 40:01.033
Trust me on this.

40:01.100 --> 40:03.033
'You're making it worse,
now I'm her mother'

40:03.100 --> 40:05.033
'I have the right to know.'

40:06.566 --> 40:09.100
Apparently Patty's mother
was a nurse

40:09.166 --> 40:11.733
at the Springwood Home
for the criminally insane.

40:13.500 --> 40:16.433
And, uh,
her father was an inmate.

40:16.500 --> 40:18.633
He's one of those charming
pathological types.

40:18.700 --> 40:21.333
He, uh, lured Patty's mother
into having affair with him

40:21.400 --> 40:23.333
and she got pregnant.

40:26.066 --> 40:27.266
Go on.

40:27.333 --> 40:29.300
Look, could we just drop this?

40:30.466 --> 40:32.033
I-I should never have
gotten into this.

40:32.100 --> 40:33.600
'Jack, I have to know.'

40:33.666 --> 40:35.433
Please.

40:36.533 --> 40:38.166
Patty's mother
tried several times

40:38.233 --> 40:40.566
to end the pregnancy.

40:40.633 --> 40:42.833
'In the end
she had to be restrained.'

40:46.066 --> 40:48.300
Finally when she delivered..

40:48.366 --> 40:50.100
...they showed her the baby,
she ran down the hall

40:50.166 --> 40:52.133
screaming,
"It's a monster." or something.

40:53.700 --> 40:55.633
'Nobody knew what
she meant by it.'

40:56.633 --> 40:58.566
She killed herself.

40:58.633 --> 41:00.633
'Threw herself
out the eighth floor window.'

41:08.333 --> 41:10.300
See what you've done?

41:25.666 --> 41:27.600
Let her sleep, we'll work
this out in the morning.

41:28.500 --> 41:30.100
Okay.

41:30.166 --> 41:31.166
One thing's for sure.

41:31.233 --> 41:33.200
I want that damn dog
out of here.

42:11.400 --> 42:13.533
Good, dog, stay.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.566
Patty.

42:15.633 --> 42:17.233
You tell that dog

42:17.300 --> 42:18.533
to go away.

42:19.533 --> 42:20.833
Good, dog, stay.

42:21.733 --> 42:23.300
'You killed grandma.'

42:23.366 --> 42:25.300
'I saw you kill her.'

42:25.366 --> 42:27.500
Oh, sweetheart,
you don't understand.

42:27.566 --> 42:29.100
- Mommy--
- You're not my mommy.

42:29.166 --> 42:30.333
I hate you!

42:35.733 --> 42:37.700
Oh, my God.

42:41.900 --> 42:43.200
Oh!

42:44.466 --> 42:46.433
Oh!

42:48.000 --> 42:49.933
Patty, please.
Patty, please.

42:52.133 --> 42:53.266
Stop!

42:53.333 --> 42:54.866
Stop this. Stop this.

42:54.933 --> 42:56.900
Please.

43:09.800 --> 43:11.733
What's the matter?

43:13.100 --> 43:15.033
Fetch.

43:20.966 --> 43:22.933
Patty.

43:23.866 --> 43:25.833
Oh..

43:38.133 --> 43:40.100
Oh, my God.

43:57.033 --> 43:58.200
I'm ready for that trip

43:58.266 --> 44:00.933
to the Grand Canyon, daddy.

44:14.800 --> 44:17.600
I guess Jack was right.

44:17.666 --> 44:19.100
Maggie's on a roll.

44:21.966 --> 44:23.966
It's after midnight.

44:24.033 --> 44:26.466
Do you know
who your children are?

44:29.800 --> 44:31.733
Trust me.

44:32.933 --> 44:34.900
You haven't got a clue.
