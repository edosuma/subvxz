23:05.550 --> 23:07.719
have done differently
in Judicael's tattoo?

the reaper.

- Hello.
- We're witnessing Nikki

26:12.871 --> 26:14.839
{\an1}nervous for the first time,
possibly.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.675
- Shut the [bleep] up.
- I--don't mean

26:16.741 --> 26:19.411

- No, I mean, so confident.

26:19.477 --> 26:21.179
- [laughs]
- I love going against

26:21.246 --> 26:23.381
an artist that makes
me nervous,

26:23.448 --> 26:25.383
'cause it never really happens.

26:25.450 --> 26:26.952
So this is a
new day for me.

26:27.018 --> 26:28.353
- I respect your work,
and I think

26:28.420 --> 26:29.654
you're an awesome tattooer,

26:29.721 --> 26:30.956
but I'm gonna give
you hell today.

26:31.022 --> 26:32.557
- You're one of the most
versatile artists

26:32.624 --> 26:33.825
that we've seen.
You really do have

26:33.892 --> 26:35.393
what it takes to get
on "Ink Master."

26:35.460 --> 26:36.761
And if you do
a sick tattoo today,

26:36.828 --> 26:38.096
you're getting on there, man.

26:38.163 --> 26:39.431
- Awesome.
I plan on it.

26:39.497 --> 26:42.167
- Well, sicker than mine,
so good luck.

26:42.233 --> 26:43.668
- [chuckles]

26:43.735 --> 26:45.136
- Are you ready to hear
how voting's gonna go?

26:45.203 --> 26:47.639
all: Oh, yeah.
- You guys, our local artists,

26:47.706 --> 26:50.542
are gonna collectively
have one vote.

26:50.608 --> 26:52.110
- Hell, yeah.
- We're gonna kill it.

26:52.177 --> 26:53.745
- The Angels not competing,

26:53.812 --> 26:56.014
{\an3}we're gonna collectively
get one vote.

26:56.081 --> 26:59.384
And we have a big honkin' crowd
coming in,

26:59.451 --> 27:01.486
and they're gonna
have one vote.

27:01.553 --> 27:02.954
- Better come
with it, Tony.

27:03.021 --> 27:04.389
- The heat's on.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.558
- You guys have six hours
to complete your tattoo,

27:06.624 --> 27:07.792
and the two of
you will be doing

27:07.859 --> 27:09.928
whatever your canvas wants.

27:09.995 --> 27:11.262
{\an1}- Okay.

27:11.329 --> 27:13.064
- There is another reason
why it's been so important

27:13.131 --> 27:15.300
{\an1}for us to find the best artist
here in Reno.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.535
{\an1}Unfortunately, Nevada has
a suicide rate

27:17.602 --> 27:20.138
{\an1}that is significantly higher
than the national average.

27:20.205 --> 27:23.408
{\an1}Both of your canvases today
have lost a loved one

27:23.475 --> 27:26.611
due to suicide.

27:26.678 --> 27:28.380
Let's bring out your canvases.

27:31.816 --> 27:33.251
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

27:33.318 --> 27:34.786
- Are you okay?
You know Tony?

27:34.853 --> 27:36.354
- He tattooed--
yeah, he tattooed

27:36.421 --> 27:39.090
my son that passed away.
- It's true.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.126
Just a random
kid that came in one day,

27:41.192 --> 27:43.928
and we just connected.
I tell everyone about him.

27:43.995 --> 27:47.198
- I lost my son Matt
to his battle with depression

27:47.265 --> 27:50.035
20 days after he turned 21.

27:50.101 --> 27:52.837
As a mom, losing your child
is the last thing

27:52.904 --> 27:55.607
that you want to do,
and then losing them to suicide

27:55.673 --> 27:59.077
and not knowing
the answers is even harder.

27:59.144 --> 28:02.747
- I am glad that all of
you guys could be here today.

28:02.814 --> 28:05.316
- My name's Alan.
This is my wife, Candace.

28:05.383 --> 28:08.953
My mother lost her battle
with depression.

28:11.189 --> 28:13.792
- You're doing great.

28:13.858 --> 28:15.126
- Her battle with depression

28:15.193 --> 28:17.562
prevented her from being
at our wedding.

28:17.629 --> 28:19.831
She took her life
a few weeks after that,

28:19.898 --> 28:21.833
and she was never able
to meet my wife.

28:23.201 --> 28:25.036
- This is a tough one,
I'm not gonna lie.

28:25.103 --> 28:28.740
- Well, Tony,
since Reno is your city,

28:28.807 --> 28:31.309
you get to pick
an Angel skull.

28:31.376 --> 28:34.079
The name on the bottom
of the skull will indicate

28:34.145 --> 28:37.015
which canvas you'll
be tattooing.

28:37.082 --> 28:38.783
- Okay.

28:44.889 --> 28:48.159
I got you.
- [sniffs]

28:48.226 --> 28:49.794
{\an1}[sobs]

28:49.861 --> 28:52.630
- I just can't believe this.

28:52.697 --> 28:54.599
- That's destiny.

28:54.666 --> 28:56.701
- And you know,
I'm so happy you got it, man.

28:56.768 --> 28:58.570
I understand why.
- I apologize

28:58.636 --> 29:00.572
for all the destiny jokes now.
- [laughs]

29:00.638 --> 29:01.940
- I really do.

29:02.006 --> 29:04.008
- Alan, that means
you're with me.

29:04.075 --> 29:05.176
- That's awesome.

29:05.243 --> 29:07.579
{\an1}- If you guys are ready,
let's get started.

29:07.645 --> 29:09.948
- Right over there.

29:10.014 --> 29:12.350
{\an1}- Can I hear more about
your story

29:12.417 --> 29:13.785
and what happened
with your mother?

29:13.852 --> 29:15.987
{\an3}- She was an awesome woman,
great mother.

29:16.054 --> 29:18.323
{\an3}She suffered from depression
her whole life.

29:18.389 --> 29:20.391
{\an3}It got to the point where
she wouldn't come out

29:20.458 --> 29:21.860
of her room, and the anxiety,

29:21.926 --> 29:23.328
just being around people.

29:23.394 --> 29:27.065
{\an3}We got married,
and then October 2nd, 2012,

29:27.132 --> 29:29.634
she took her life.

29:29.701 --> 29:31.002
She loved angels,

29:31.069 --> 29:32.604
and she loved the color purple.

29:32.670 --> 29:34.639
- I'm gonna give you
the best angel I got.

29:34.706 --> 29:36.541
- Thank you so much.
- All right.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.176
- Matthew battled
with depression.

29:38.243 --> 29:41.179
{\an3}He went to counseling,
and they had diagnosed him

29:41.246 --> 29:43.381
with clinical depression.

29:43.448 --> 29:44.716
He was in pain.

29:44.782 --> 29:47.819
{\an3}He had a disease
that nobody talks about.

29:47.886 --> 29:50.788
{\an3}Nobody acknowledges
mental illness.

29:50.855 --> 29:52.857
{\an3}It's surreal,
because at one moment,

29:52.924 --> 29:57.896
{\an3}you're going, "I lost my son."
And at the next moment,

29:57.962 --> 30:01.533
{\an3}you...

30:01.599 --> 30:05.703
{\an3}feel that your son is
finally at peace.

30:05.770 --> 30:08.106
{\an3}When he needed a break,
he would draw.

30:08.173 --> 30:10.675
{\an3}Going through his stuff,
I found his book.

30:10.742 --> 30:14.579
{\an3}I wanted to kind of incorporate
some of him.

30:14.646 --> 30:15.880
- Okay.

30:15.947 --> 30:17.515
{\an3}- I just want
a piece of him.

30:17.582 --> 30:18.650
{\an1}- So, do you want
to see what I have?

30:18.716 --> 30:20.585
- I do.
- All right.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.120
- That is beautiful.

30:22.187 --> 30:25.757
{\an1}- I thought instead of a
halo, we could do a crown,

30:25.823 --> 30:30.061
{\an1}because having a crown
represents power and strength,

30:30.128 --> 30:32.163
which she always
fought to have.

30:32.230 --> 30:33.831
- It's awesome.

30:33.898 --> 30:35.934
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.603
{\an1}- I was thinking something
along those lines.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.104
- And you put a
butterfly in it.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.040
{\an1}- Yeah, 'cause he's
reincarnated.

30:44.008 --> 30:45.410
- We always say
that he's around

30:45.476 --> 30:47.979
when there's butterflies.
- It just came to me.

30:48.046 --> 30:50.748
{\an1}He loved just nice, decorative
pattern cloaks, you know?

30:50.815 --> 30:53.017
{\an1}So, I pulled a lot
of the elements.

30:53.084 --> 30:55.386
{\an1}This is gonna be
a suicide awareness...

30:55.453 --> 30:57.322
- Ribbon
- Ribbon as her scarf.

30:57.388 --> 30:59.057
- I think it's awesome.
- I used a lot

30:59.123 --> 31:02.760
{\an1}of his drawing stuff,
so me and him created this.

31:02.827 --> 31:04.596
- That is so perfect.

31:04.662 --> 31:06.464
- Good, I'm glad.
- Thank you.

that he's with me.
Thank you.

36:14.672 --> 36:16.207
[cheers and applause]

36:16.274 --> 36:18.976
crowd: Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

36:19.043 --> 36:22.246
[cheers and applause]

36:23.347 --> 36:26.484
- All right, Reno.
This race is gonna be close,

36:26.551 --> 36:28.219
so I need you
to inspect these carefully.

36:28.286 --> 36:31.422
Voting is officially open.
Go check out the tattoos.

36:31.489 --> 36:34.892
[cheers and applause]

36:36.060 --> 36:37.361
{\an1}- Congratulations
on the face.

36:37.428 --> 36:39.597
{\an1}It's like a really peaceful,
vivid expression.

36:39.664 --> 36:41.465
- Thank you.
- It's living and breathing.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.834
It's awesome.
- Thank you so much.

36:43.901 --> 36:45.202
- I voted for Nikki's tattoo

36:45.269 --> 36:47.605
because everything
is just so detailed.

36:47.672 --> 36:49.840
<i>She did it strand by strand</i>
<i>on the hair.</i>

36:49.907 --> 36:51.475
She's amazing.

36:53.544 --> 36:55.179
{\an3}- So much color
and detail to that.

36:55.246 --> 36:57.381
- Your line work
is outstanding.

36:57.448 --> 36:59.116
- Thank you.
- I wish one of you had done

36:59.183 --> 37:00.885
a bad job so this was
an easier choice.

37:00.952 --> 37:02.420
Well one.
- Thank you.

37:02.486 --> 37:04.755
- I voted for Tony 'cause
I really love how the face

37:04.822 --> 37:06.657
<i>morphs into the butterfly.</i>
<i>It feels like it has</i>

37:06.724 --> 37:08.626
<i>an underlying story</i>
<i>that speaks a bigger message.</i>

37:08.693 --> 37:11.395
I could tell he put all
his heart and soul into it.

37:13.698 --> 37:15.066
- Bro, see Nikki's tattoo?

37:15.132 --> 37:17.401
{\an1}- The design in itself
is gorgeous, very beautiful,

37:17.468 --> 37:19.070
<i>very aesthetically pleasing.</i>

37:19.136 --> 37:20.838
<i>- Just the way she put</i>
<i>that face in,</i>

37:20.905 --> 37:23.774
<i>with that shading, bro,</i>
<i>it's really flawless.</i>

37:23.841 --> 37:25.009
<i>- It's so smooth.</i>

37:25.076 --> 37:26.644
{\an3}- What I really enjoy
about Tony's

37:26.711 --> 37:27.845
is the story behind it.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.580
<i>The suicide awareness ribbon.</i>

37:29.647 --> 37:32.016
<i>I'm just blown away.</i>
<i>- And then he did color work,</i>

37:32.083 --> 37:33.451
<i>strong, bold outline.</i>

37:33.517 --> 37:35.386
{\an3}- This is a tough one
to judge,

37:35.453 --> 37:36.988
{\an3}because they're both
clean tattoos.

37:37.054 --> 37:38.456
- Exactly, bro.

37:42.226 --> 37:44.895
{\an1}- They're both
stunning pieces.

37:44.962 --> 37:47.431
- Design-wise, I'm...

37:47.498 --> 37:50.901
a little more impressed by
Nikki's in its simplicity.

37:50.968 --> 37:52.603
<i>- The way she was able to make</i>

37:52.670 --> 37:55.473
<i>an angel wing still</i>
<i>look strong.</i>

37:55.539 --> 37:57.341
<i>- She was able</i>
<i>to beautifully render</i>

37:57.408 --> 37:59.143
<i>all of the highlights</i>

37:59.210 --> 38:01.145
<i>in those difficult planes</i>
<i>of the human face.</i>

38:01.212 --> 38:02.446
She does it effortlessly.

38:02.513 --> 38:04.315
{\an1}- But then you look at
Tony's composition,

38:04.382 --> 38:07.118
<i>and he knows tattooer tricks.</i>

38:07.184 --> 38:08.953
<i>He made a figure eight,</i>

38:09.020 --> 38:11.122
<i>and it draws you</i>
<i>all the way around</i>

38:11.188 --> 38:13.324
<i>with exactly that type</i>
<i>of shape that should be</i>

38:13.391 --> 38:15.026
<i>on the back of the calf.</i>

38:15.092 --> 38:16.927
- Tony really went
above and beyond

38:16.994 --> 38:19.964
{\an3}to add specific
hand-drawn elements

38:20.031 --> 38:24.068
<i>into that tattoo that</i>
<i>his canvas's son drew himself.</i>

38:24.135 --> 38:26.270
The meaning behind
it is so powerful.

38:26.337 --> 38:30.141
- I--honestly, I have no idea
how to judge this right now.

38:30.207 --> 38:35.646
<i>♪ ♪</i>

38:35.713 --> 38:37.214
- What's up, Reno?

fate and destiny

39:38.542 --> 39:40.778
<i>in front of my eyes today.</i>

39:40.845 --> 39:43.948
Tony deserves to win,

39:44.014 --> 39:46.617
Oh, man.

39:46.684 --> 39:48.252

39:48.319 --> 39:49.954
<i>- I just beat Nikki Simpson.</i>

She's a badass.
