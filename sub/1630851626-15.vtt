00:01.653 --> 00:05.744
Previously onB Positive...Gina,

00:05.788 --> 00:07.529
how long are we gonna do this?

00:07.572 --> 00:08.834
Do what?

00:09.792 --> 00:11.054
I love you.

00:13.578 --> 00:17.408
Ah, the long pause after
I tell a woman I love her.

00:17.452 --> 00:19.062
Reminds me of my marriage.

00:21.238 --> 00:24.285
It's complicated. I just...

00:24.328 --> 00:25.677
I need more time.

00:29.290 --> 00:30.552
Morning.

00:30.595 --> 00:31.683
Morning.

00:32.684 --> 00:34.817
Hey. Are you mad at me?

00:34.860 --> 00:36.384
Not at all.

00:36.427 --> 00:37.994
Can we talk later?Not sure.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.735
I might need
some more time.

00:39.778 --> 00:41.911
Stings, don't it?

00:43.478 --> 00:45.001
[sighs]
Good morning!

00:45.045 --> 00:46.481
Hey, everybody!
Hey!Morning!

00:46.524 --> 00:47.786
All right,
let's get started.

00:47.830 --> 00:49.614
Gideon, any health updates?

00:49.658 --> 00:51.051
We need to keep an eye
on Mrs. Jenkins.

00:51.094 --> 00:52.617
Her blood pressure's
a little high.

00:52.661 --> 00:53.749
But...

00:53.792 --> 00:54.880
she's from Mississippi,
so that could be

00:54.924 --> 00:57.492
because a gay Black man
touched her arm.

00:57.535 --> 00:59.015
Make sure she's taking her meds

00:59.059 --> 01:01.887
and maybe ease up
on the show tunes?

01:02.888 --> 01:04.499
I have something
I'd like to say.

01:04.542 --> 01:05.978
Uh, one second,
Althea.

01:06.022 --> 01:07.676
Bert, have you hired
a new dishwasher?

01:07.719 --> 01:09.591
Yeah, but I don't think
it's gonna work out.

01:09.634 --> 01:11.158
He's not real smart.

01:11.201 --> 01:12.594
How would you know?

01:12.637 --> 01:14.378
How would I know what?

01:15.553 --> 01:16.511
All right, moving on.

01:16.554 --> 01:17.642
Can I please say something?

01:17.686 --> 01:20.341
One more second.
This is super important.

01:20.384 --> 01:24.432
Another prospective resident has
chosen Golden Horizons over us.

01:24.475 --> 01:26.042
That is the third one
this month.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.131
How do we stop
losing people to them?

01:28.175 --> 01:31.874
We go on their Facebook page
and tell people they're sluts.

01:31.917 --> 01:35.443
Gabby, we don't slut-shame
other retirement homes.

01:35.486 --> 01:37.488
Can I please speak now?Sure.

01:37.532 --> 01:39.186
I'm quitting.What?

01:39.229 --> 01:40.578
Starting Monday,

01:40.622 --> 01:42.406
I'm working at Golden Horizons.

I can't hear. What are they
talking about over there?

03:20.678 --> 03:22.985
Bette and Spencer had sex.

What's up?You know how Mrs. Ludlum

03:30.993 --> 03:32.386
made the staff schedule?

03:32.429 --> 03:33.909
Maybe. Yeah.

03:33.952 --> 03:35.345
I don't know.

03:35.389 --> 03:36.999
Well, she did.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.653
Okay, what's the problem?

03:38.696 --> 03:39.871
With her gone,
there's no schedule,

03:39.915 --> 03:41.395
and no one came in
to work the night shift.

03:41.438 --> 03:42.222

03:57.193 --> 03:59.326
They sent two guys over
to get all her stuff.

03:59.369 --> 04:02.416
One cute, one didn't like
to be tickled.

04:02.459 --> 04:04.940
So they're poaching
our residents now?

04:04.983 --> 04:06.898
Looks like it.Oh, man.

I'll take that as a yes.[sighs]

05:19.536 --> 05:21.146
I don't know how
to do any of this!

don't know how to compete

05:22.974 --> 05:24.846

05:26.717 --> 05:28.676
What if we went over there,
you know?

05:28.719 --> 05:30.808

See what we're up against.

05:32.506 --> 05:33.463

retirement homes.

05:37.511 --> 05:38.947

come along as my mom who I love,

05:42.037 --> 05:44.735

to let her live with us.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.563

and a cover story.

05:46.607 --> 05:47.564

05:47.608 --> 05:49.566

05:49.610 --> 05:52.047
No, landscape architect.

05:52.090 --> 05:53.744

Maybe pills.

05:53.788 --> 05:54.789
I'll work on it.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.095
And I could be
your wife,

05:57.139 --> 06:00.664
Stacey, who's
only occasionally unfaithful.

06:00.708 --> 06:03.188
Why?Oh, Doug,

06:03.232 --> 06:05.147
you know why.

06:11.283 --> 06:14.678
Wow. Swanky.

06:17.464 --> 06:18.465
[scoffs]

06:18.508 --> 06:20.336
I told you not to bring her.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.511

06:21.555 --> 06:23.470
Yet here we are.

Nice to meet you.Yeah.

Uh, why
don't we chat

07:28.883 --> 07:30.537
a bit and then we
can take the tour.

07:32.190 --> 07:35.411
You might want to have someone
take a look at that ficus.

07:38.501 --> 07:39.676
we also have

07:39.720 --> 07:41.243

Oh....three restaurants...

07:43.027 --> 07:44.899

even at a retirement home.

Because it's great, not
because of cognitive decline.

07:56.519 --> 07:57.477
I'm in.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.348
Why don't you go
wait in the car?

Why don't you go wait
in the car?

08:01.524 --> 08:03.657

ladies, please.

Oh, so sorry. Sisters.

killed a man.

thinking about it.

08:17.409 --> 08:18.976
Yeah, don't ask

08:19.020 --> 08:20.630
the old ball and chain
to make a decision.

08:20.674 --> 08:21.936

she needs more time.

08:23.415 --> 08:25.417
Doug, like I said
on our wedding night,

08:25.461 --> 08:28.159
get off my back.

08:28.203 --> 08:30.161
NORMA:
All right, kids.

08:30.205 --> 08:31.293
Settle down.

08:31.336 --> 08:33.600
We're also looking
into Valley Hills.

08:33.643 --> 08:35.384
Valley Hills?

08:35.427 --> 08:38.300
Don't you love your mommy?

08:38.343 --> 08:41.172
Um, she doesn't love anyone.

08:42.913 --> 08:45.481
I've actually heard a lot
of good things about that place.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.482
Really?

08:46.526 --> 08:48.005
What I've heard

08:48.049 --> 08:50.486
is there is rampant drug use
amongst the staff

08:50.530 --> 08:54.490
and the van driver is having
a full mental breakdown.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.926
I've heard that, too.

08:57.319 --> 08:59.147
Plus,

08:59.190 --> 09:01.366
I just hired away
their best person

09:01.410 --> 09:02.542
to be our general manager.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.369
She is a gem.

09:04.413 --> 09:06.110
That's all well
and good, uh,

09:06.154 --> 09:09.113
but what we're looking for is a
place that treats its residents

09:09.157 --> 09:12.073
with respect, kindness
and compassion.

09:12.116 --> 09:15.337
Once a year, we take
all the residents on a cruise

09:15.380 --> 09:16.904
through the Caribbean.

09:16.947 --> 09:19.167
How do you
frickin' do that?

09:19.210 --> 09:20.864
We're a huge corporation.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.126
We have our own boat.

09:24.041 --> 09:26.304
I'm gonna go wait
in the car.

09:28.045 --> 09:30.004
This cruise ship,

09:30.047 --> 09:32.093
does it have slots?

09:35.575 --> 09:36.924
[sighs]

09:36.967 --> 09:37.925
One more?

09:37.968 --> 09:38.969
Mm.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.667
Nine more.

09:41.755 --> 09:43.191
You're really good

09:43.234 --> 09:45.454
at your job. Hmm.

09:45.497 --> 09:46.586
You know what I'm good at?

09:47.412 --> 09:48.805
Nothing.

09:48.849 --> 09:50.590
[chuckles]

09:50.633 --> 09:51.591
I thought I was good,

09:51.634 --> 09:53.505
because, you know,

09:53.549 --> 09:54.724
look at me.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.813
I'm adorable.

09:56.857 --> 09:58.641
But...

09:58.685 --> 10:02.427
recent evidence suggests that...
[sniffles]

10:02.471 --> 10:04.038
that is not adequate.

10:05.430 --> 10:06.388
You actually have

10:06.431 --> 10:09.260
to know stuff, and I...

10:09.304 --> 10:10.697
I don't know stuff.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.046
I don't...

10:12.089 --> 10:14.352
I don't even know

10:14.396 --> 10:16.050
what I don't even know.

10:17.051 --> 10:19.444
Have some nuts.See?

10:19.488 --> 10:21.795
You're good at your job.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.667
Oh, my.

10:24.711 --> 10:27.714
Now I know how Rose felt when
she went below deck in Titanic.

10:27.757 --> 10:29.585
Uh, no spoilers.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.282
I haven't seen it yet.

10:32.457 --> 10:33.458
Come on.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.853
Hey.

10:37.854 --> 10:41.510
Oh, hey.

10:41.553 --> 10:43.077
Mm, it's time for you
to go home.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.731
Ooh, but I just got my nuts.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.211
Those are the best.

10:47.255 --> 10:48.909
When you wake up the next day,

10:48.952 --> 10:53.000
they're still in your teeth,
and you can eat them again.

10:53.043 --> 10:56.003
Yeah, come on, Gina, this
isn't accomplishing anything.

10:56.046 --> 10:58.440
Don't you get it, Drew?
I failed.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.485
I completely failed.

11:00.529 --> 11:02.531
I can't run Valley Hills
without Mrs. Ludlum,

11:02.574 --> 11:05.708
and I sure as hell
can't compete with a place

11:05.752 --> 11:08.842
that has a damn boat.

11:08.885 --> 11:12.628
Okay, so you failed a few times.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.716
Success only
has meaning

11:13.760 --> 11:14.848
if you've also failed.

11:14.891 --> 11:16.501
Believe me, I should know.

11:16.545 --> 11:18.286
When did you succeed?

11:18.329 --> 11:19.635
Hey, I'm on your side.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.856
Can I tell you a little story?

11:22.899 --> 11:25.902
Uh, Bert, now's not the time.

11:25.946 --> 11:28.644
When I was in culinary school,

11:28.688 --> 11:30.994
I thought I was
the worst one in class.

11:31.038 --> 11:34.737
No matter what I cooked,
everything turned to diarrhea.

11:34.781 --> 11:37.305
Not literally,
but was the cause of.

11:37.348 --> 11:38.915
Where are you going with this?

11:38.959 --> 11:40.395
Let's see.

11:41.657 --> 11:44.834
I worked my ass off,
I never gave up

11:44.878 --> 11:48.969
and when I graduated, I got
recruited to be the head chef

11:49.012 --> 11:52.363
at the Connecticut
State Prison For Women.

11:52.407 --> 11:55.149
Which is also
where I met my wife.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.586
I don't even know
what to say to that.

11:57.629 --> 11:59.283
No one ever does.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.330
Gina, do you know the saying,

12:02.373 --> 12:04.506
it's not how many times
you get knocked down,

12:04.549 --> 12:05.942
it's how many times you get up?

12:05.986 --> 12:07.683
I do.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.729
It's time for you to get up.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.339
I don't want to.Get up, Gina.

12:11.382 --> 12:16.518
No. I just want to stay
here with my salty nuts.

12:16.561 --> 12:17.737
Get up.

12:17.780 --> 12:18.781
[shushes]

12:18.825 --> 12:20.783
Get up.

12:20.827 --> 12:23.830
Okay. Okay, I will.

12:23.873 --> 12:26.310
[exhales, blows raspberry]

12:26.354 --> 12:28.660
It's time to get up.

12:29.923 --> 12:31.707
Oh, God.It's okay!

12:31.751 --> 12:32.926
I'm okay.

12:32.969 --> 12:33.970
No, I'm not.

12:40.498 --> 12:42.805
It'd be great if you could get
those insurance reimbursements

12:42.849 --> 12:44.764
in the mail today.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.113
Payroll's all squared away,

12:46.156 --> 12:47.418
the bills are taken care of.

12:47.462 --> 12:48.550
[laughs softly]

12:48.593 --> 12:49.899
What's so funny?

12:49.943 --> 12:51.945
You guys know how to do stuff.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.816
Why wouldn't we?You're old.

12:55.426 --> 12:57.994
I finished the staff
schedule for the next week.

12:58.038 --> 13:00.910
I happen to excel at Excel.

13:00.954 --> 13:04.871
Yeah, say it a tenth time,
then it'll be funny.

13:04.914 --> 13:06.002
How's it coming with the, uh,

13:06.046 --> 13:07.134
Yelp reviews?

13:07.177 --> 13:08.918
I think I got a winner here.

13:08.962 --> 13:12.095
"My grandmother checked in
to Golden Horizons

13:12.139 --> 13:15.838
"a vibrant, fun-loving
85-year-old woman.

13:15.882 --> 13:20.321
She's no longer vibrant and
fun-loving 'cause she's dead."

13:21.539 --> 13:23.019
I prefer mine.

13:23.063 --> 13:26.631
"Like the winds of Aeolus
in Homer's Odyssey,

13:26.675 --> 13:29.852
Golden Horizons blows."

13:29.896 --> 13:31.462
BETTE:
Mine's simpler.

13:31.506 --> 13:35.031
"The rooms are small and
the people are ugly."

13:37.381 --> 13:40.994
[British accent]: Hello,
is this Mr. Asher Singleton?

13:41.037 --> 13:45.650
Hello, Asher, this is
Cynthia Wallaby Smugbottom.

13:45.694 --> 13:47.870
How have you been?

13:47.914 --> 13:49.654
What do you mean
you don't know me?

13:49.698 --> 13:53.354
I'm going to have your baby,
you scoundrel!

13:53.397 --> 13:55.356
IRENE [British accent]:
Watch your step,

13:55.399 --> 13:57.706
Cynthia, I think
your water broke.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.882
Oh, God, no.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.235
What's happening?

14:05.279 --> 14:07.150
Well, uh...

14:07.194 --> 14:11.024
sometimes when you have trouble
getting up, people help you.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.547
I don't understand.

14:12.590 --> 14:14.201
We're getting
all the paperwork done

14:14.244 --> 14:15.724
Mrs. Ludlum took care of.

14:15.767 --> 14:17.508
Really?

14:17.552 --> 14:19.771
It was his idea.

14:19.815 --> 14:21.730
Well, everyone pitched in.

14:21.773 --> 14:23.732
But yes, it was mainly me.

14:23.775 --> 14:24.733
Thank you.

14:24.776 --> 14:26.169
How you feeling?

14:26.213 --> 14:28.476
Ugh, not so great, I...

14:28.519 --> 14:30.521
Hold on.
[tongue clicking]

14:33.481 --> 14:35.222
Nuts.

14:36.179 --> 14:37.485
Ew.

14:42.055 --> 14:44.884
Nothing like a cold beer
after a job well done.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.320
Mm-hmm. I'll stick

14:46.363 --> 14:47.408
to my hard seltzer.Yeah.

14:47.451 --> 14:48.975
Beer gives me the toots.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.106
[chuckles]

14:50.150 --> 14:52.587
And is the job done?

14:52.630 --> 14:55.242
Seems like Gina's
gonna need our help

14:55.285 --> 14:57.200
until she can replace
Mrs. Ludlum.

14:57.244 --> 15:00.812
We're here for her.
You need to hit the road.

15:00.856 --> 15:03.554
Well, eventually.

15:03.598 --> 15:05.513
Okay-- l-let me guess,
you're sticking around

15:05.556 --> 15:09.560
to "help Gina," right, hoping
she'll come to her senses.

15:09.604 --> 15:11.127
Mm.

15:11.171 --> 15:14.391
The Jedi master sees
through his young Padawan.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.567
Shut up with that nonsense.

15:16.611 --> 15:20.484
Seriously. You really think
there's a future for you two?

15:20.528 --> 15:23.618
Well, I did tell her I love her.

15:23.661 --> 15:25.272
So what?

15:25.315 --> 15:27.187
I once saw Ava Gardner
in a train station,

15:27.230 --> 15:29.972
I yelled out "I love you, Ava!"

15:30.016 --> 15:33.758
Frank Sinatra's goons
chased me for 11 blocks.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.282
What's your point?

15:35.325 --> 15:37.110
Well, I had more of a shot
than you do.

15:39.851 --> 15:43.333
I just wish
she'd give me a chance.

15:43.377 --> 15:45.596
Well, my old man used to say,

15:45.640 --> 15:46.510
"Wish in one hand,
crap in the other,

15:46.554 --> 15:47.990
see which one fills first."

15:48.034 --> 15:51.994
Hmm. That is an
unpleasant image.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.996
So is you sitting
in a retirement home

15:54.040 --> 15:56.781
waiting for the princess
to come kiss the frog.

15:56.825 --> 16:01.917
So basically, I'm a frog
with a fistful of poop?

16:03.005 --> 16:04.354
Now you're getting it.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.200
LUDLUM:
Gina?

16:24.244 --> 16:25.680
Some ginger kid unplugged it.

16:26.898 --> 16:28.639
What are you doing here?

16:28.683 --> 16:30.902
Uh, I missed you,
I just wanted to check in.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.731
Over here.

16:35.559 --> 16:39.911
So, um, how you
liking your new job?

16:39.955 --> 16:41.652
It's fine.
I've got a big office

16:41.696 --> 16:44.133
with a view
of the putting green.

16:44.177 --> 16:47.441
Hmm. Putting green.
How about that?

16:47.484 --> 16:48.703
[sighs]

16:48.746 --> 16:51.358
I got to admit,

16:51.401 --> 16:54.100
I had no idea how much
you did at Valley Hills.

16:54.143 --> 16:56.580
You thought I worked
60 hours a week

16:56.624 --> 16:59.627
'cause I liked the constant
smell of old people?

16:59.670 --> 17:01.629
I don't smell it anymore.

17:01.672 --> 17:04.675
It's like when you live
next to a farm.

17:06.634 --> 17:09.332
I'm sorry I didn't
appreciate you like I should've.

17:10.464 --> 17:11.682
You and me both.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.163
I want you back.

17:14.207 --> 17:15.773
Gina...Hear me out.

17:15.817 --> 17:17.993
I cannot do this without you.

17:18.037 --> 17:21.605
So let me make you
general manager.

17:21.649 --> 17:23.694
I'm already
general manager here.

17:23.738 --> 17:26.871
Plus ten percent ownership
of Valley Hills.

17:28.264 --> 17:30.005
Are you serious?

17:30.049 --> 17:34.053
You are the glue that holds
that place together.

17:34.096 --> 17:38.883
Now if we succeed,
you succeed.

17:40.581 --> 17:41.886
I don't know what to say.

17:41.930 --> 17:43.410
Say yes.

17:44.976 --> 17:48.023
I admit, this place doesn't have
the soul of Valley Hills.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.373
I knew we had something
they didn't.

17:50.417 --> 17:54.334
Yesterday we had to kick
somebody out

17:54.377 --> 17:55.639
'cause they lost
their insurance.

17:55.683 --> 17:58.294
You would never do that.No.

17:58.338 --> 18:00.166
I wouldn't.

18:00.209 --> 18:02.298
I also wouldn't know how.

18:04.561 --> 18:07.260
Well, I appreciate the offer.

18:07.303 --> 18:09.784
I just need some time to think.

18:09.827 --> 18:12.439
I get it.

18:12.482 --> 18:14.919
Boy, do I get it.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.445
Thanks for talking with me.

18:18.488 --> 18:20.577
Gina.Yeah?

18:20.621 --> 18:23.450
Do you still think it was
the right thing for you

18:23.493 --> 18:24.755
to buy Valley Hills?

18:24.799 --> 18:26.192
I do.

18:26.235 --> 18:28.237
Althea, do you have
a moment? Oh.

18:28.281 --> 18:30.631
Mrs. O'Bama, how lovely
to see you again.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.199
"Mrs. O'Bama"?

18:34.243 --> 18:35.288
Mm, got to go.

18:53.741 --> 18:55.743
[shouts, grunts]

18:58.615 --> 19:00.617
Why did I do that?

19:01.270 --> 19:02.228
Hey.

19:02.271 --> 19:04.360
Hey.Hey, good news. Uh...

19:04.404 --> 19:06.623
Mrs. Ludlum's coming back.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.277
Oh, that is good news.

19:08.321 --> 19:11.672
I just, I wanted to thank you
again for everything you did.

19:11.715 --> 19:14.457
Well, you gave me a kidney
and I scraped you off

19:14.501 --> 19:17.025
of a barroom floor,
I'd say we're even.

19:17.068 --> 19:19.810
Yeah. I'm...

19:19.854 --> 19:21.595
I'm really lucky to have you.

19:21.638 --> 19:24.032
No, I'm the lucky one.

19:27.427 --> 19:30.473
So I have decided
on my next adventure.

19:30.517 --> 19:33.215
Oh. Valley Forge again?

19:33.259 --> 19:35.826
I am intrigued
by the historical reenactments.

19:35.870 --> 19:37.741
[chuckles]I was actually

19:37.785 --> 19:39.526
thinking Alaska.

19:39.569 --> 19:41.397
Wow. Really?

19:41.441 --> 19:43.051
I've always wanted to go.

19:43.094 --> 19:44.835
Maybe I can work
on a crab boat for the summer

19:44.879 --> 19:46.533
like in Deadliest Catch.

19:46.576 --> 19:48.448
I have a nice set of rain boots.

19:51.364 --> 19:53.583
That's a long time to be gone.

19:53.627 --> 19:58.109
I figured it would be good
for me to get away for a while.

20:00.024 --> 20:01.461
Are you sure about that?

20:01.504 --> 20:03.245
I'm sure.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.073
It just

20:05.116 --> 20:07.554
feels like it's time
for me to move on.
