I LIKE HIS EYES.

11:08.702 --> 11:12.573
AND I WOULD KILL NIELS BOHR
AND MARRY EINSTEIN.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.810
YOU KNOW THERE ARE
FEMALE SCIENTISTS, RIGHT?

11:16.877 --> 11:18.979
YOU HAVE YOUR LIST,
SETH,

11:19.046 --> 11:21.481
AND I HAVE MINE.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.517
( CELL PHONE RINGS )

11:23.584 --> 11:26.620
OH, IT'S JO,
THE OLD BALL AND CHAIN.

11:27.721 --> 11:30.424
WHAT UP, BABYCAKES?

11:30.490 --> 11:32.759
LOUIS, WE TALKED
ABOUT THAT.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.762
HI, JO, WHAT'S UP?

11:35.829 --> 11:38.232
THIS IS A LITTLE
EMBARRASSING,

11:38.298 --> 11:42.236
BUT GEORGIA AND I
ARE STUCK IN A CHAIR
IN A BASEMENT

11:42.302 --> 11:43.804
AND WE NEED SOME MUSCLE.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.639
WELL, I'M YOUR GUY.

11:45.706 --> 11:48.542
ACTUALLY, COULD YOU TELL
SETH TO COME DOWN, PLEASE?

11:49.676 --> 11:52.379
SURE, NO PROBLEM.

11:52.446 --> 11:53.814
SHE NEEDS ME.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.589
SETH BUILT A HOVERCRAFT
OUT OF A KICKBOARD

12:02.656 --> 12:04.258
AND BLENDER PARTS.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.927
SO HE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO FIX THIS.

12:08.695 --> 12:11.798
GREAT, SO I STILL HAVE TIME
TO SHOOT MY AUDITION SCENE.

12:11.865 --> 12:15.135
SO YOU SHAVE
ABOVE THE KNEE?

12:17.004 --> 12:19.606
I'M BORED.

12:19.673 --> 12:22.609
SOUNDS LIKE A NEW
CAPTOR'S COMING.

12:22.676 --> 12:24.044
LET'S SEE IF IT PICKS UP.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.913
THERE YOU GO, BABY.
THERE YOU GO.

12:32.586 --> 12:36.223
GOLLY, I'VE NEVER
SCALPED ANYONE BEFORE.

12:36.290 --> 12:37.724
SCALPED?

12:37.791 --> 12:40.894
THIS ISN'T A PRECISION
INSTRUMENT.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.629
WHERE DID YOUR AUNT
EVEN GET THIS?

12:42.696 --> 12:46.900
KNOWING HER, SOME SAMURAI PRINCE
OR SULTAN MUST HAVE
GIVEN IT TO HER

12:46.967 --> 12:50.337
AFTER THEIR CRAZY ADVENTURE
CHANGING WORLD HISTORY.

12:50.404 --> 12:54.341
I GOT IT FROM
THE SKYMALL CATALOG.

12:54.408 --> 12:57.811
THEY HAVE THE MOST
INTERESTING CRAP.

12:57.878 --> 13:01.481
I KNOW. I GOT A FANCY
BACKSCRATCHER FROM THERE.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.651
I GOT
AN EVEN FANCIER ONE.

13:04.718 --> 13:06.720
SCRATCH, PLEASE.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.593
SERIOUSLY, HOW DO I LOOK?

13:12.659 --> 13:16.463
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE NOT
STUCK IN A CHAIR, JO.

13:16.530 --> 13:18.498
PLEASE, HELP ME
GET OUT OF HERE.

13:18.565 --> 13:21.502
AS A MAN OF SCIENCE,
I'M CONFIDENT IN
STATING THAT

13:21.568 --> 13:24.771
THIS DRESS IS REALLY
STUCK IN THAT CHAIR.

13:24.838 --> 13:28.775
SO ARE YOU, LIKE, BOOK SMART,
BUT LIFE STUPID?

13:28.842 --> 13:31.378
YEAH, WELL SAID.

13:31.445 --> 13:33.714
OKAY, GUYS,
PLEASE LISTEN UP.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.983
I NEED YOU TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO ROLL ME UPSTAIRS

13:36.049 --> 13:37.885
SO I CAN DO
MY AUDITION TAPE.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.187
OKAY, I THINK
THAT WE SHOULD TAKE
THE CHAIR APART.

13:40.254 --> 13:41.922
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS
AND GET AN ALLEN WRENCH.

13:41.989 --> 13:44.224
- I CONCUR.
- OH, YOU CONCUR, LOUIS?

13:44.291 --> 13:46.226
YOU CONCUR, REALLY?

13:46.293 --> 13:47.961
WHAT IS AN ALLEN WRENCH?

13:48.028 --> 13:51.598
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I CAN
GO GET THAT YOU CAN'T.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.634
IT IS ON.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.672
COME HERE!

13:58.739 --> 14:00.474
AN ALLEN WRENCH?

14:00.541 --> 14:02.776
IS THAT HOW IT ENDS?
AN ALLEN WRENCH?

14:02.843 --> 14:05.679
IT'S SO ABRUPT
AND UNSATISFYING.

14:05.746 --> 14:09.483
IT'S "THE SOPRANOS" FINALE
ALL OVER AGAIN.

14:09.550 --> 14:11.385
WELL, CAN I
AT LEAST BE THERE

14:11.451 --> 14:13.654
WHEN YOU CONFRONT GEORGIA
FOR TAKING YOUR DRESS?

14:13.720 --> 14:16.323
I THINK I'M GONNA GIVE
HER A PASS ON THIS ONE.

14:16.390 --> 14:18.692
SHE'S SUFFERED
ENOUGH TONIGHT.

14:18.759 --> 14:20.194
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.396
WAIT WAIT WAIT.
IF YOU RUN INTO AUNT HONEY,

14:22.462 --> 14:24.631
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS
SHE CAN NEVER KNOW ABOUT,

14:24.698 --> 14:27.568
KIND OF LIKE THE TIME HER
INVITATION TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY

14:27.634 --> 14:29.036
"NEVER SHOWED UP."

14:30.537 --> 14:33.473
THAT WAS SUCH
A GOOD CAKE.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.843
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE YOUR PLUS ONE.

14:35.909 --> 14:38.445
AND I SAID SOME THINGS
TO MICHELLE

14:38.512 --> 14:40.614
THAT WILL BE AWFULLY HARD
TO TAKE BACK.

14:40.681 --> 14:44.184
CHANGE OF PLANS, JULES.
PRESS THAT ORANGE BUTTON.

14:49.256 --> 14:52.426
THAT DOOR JUST CLOSED
AND LOCKED BY ITSELF.

14:52.492 --> 14:55.128
AND IF I HEAR THEY WENT
TO THE ROYAL WEDDING,

14:55.195 --> 14:57.130
BREAK THAT GLASS,

14:57.197 --> 14:59.233
PUSH THE BLUE BUTTON

14:59.299 --> 15:02.169
AND TURN OFF THE SOUND.

15:13.046 --> 15:16.183
IT'S AN ELECTRONIC LOCK
WITH A 10-DIGIT KEYPAD
OUTSIDE THE DOOR

15:16.250 --> 15:20.153
AND THE CONDUIT'S TIED IN
TO THE BUILDING'S MAIN
SERVICE PANEL.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.590
WE KNOW NOW
THAT IT'S SWORD-PROOF.

15:25.526 --> 15:27.094
( WHISPERS )

15:27.160 --> 15:30.264
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE
ASKED ME TO COME OVER
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.667
I THOUGHT
I DID.

15:33.734 --> 15:36.270
DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL GET YOU GUYS
OUT OF THERE.

15:36.336 --> 15:40.140
OKAY,
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY.

15:40.207 --> 15:42.042
SO THEORETICAL QUESTION:

15:42.109 --> 15:45.145
IF WE WERE THE LAST
THREE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD,

15:45.212 --> 15:47.548
I COULD MATE WITH THE BOTH
OF YOU, RIGHT?

15:47.614 --> 15:51.151
IF WE WERE THE LAST
THREE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD,

15:51.218 --> 15:54.488
TRUST WE'D BE THE LAST
THREE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.

15:54.555 --> 15:56.190
UNTIL GEORGIA
AND I GOT HUNGRY.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.725
THEN WE'D BE THE LAST
TWO PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.894
THIS IS NOT NEARLY
AS MUCH FUN

16:00.961 --> 16:02.930
AS I THOUGHT
IT WAS GOING TO BE.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.765
JO, YOU HAVE A VIDEO CAMERA
ON THAT THING, RIGHT?

16:04.831 --> 16:07.167
OOH, NOW WE'RE
TURNING THE CORNER.

16:08.836 --> 16:10.838
I WAS THINKING THAT
IF THE BOYS DON'T
GET HERE IN TIME,

16:10.904 --> 16:13.340
MAYBE WE COULD JUST FILM
THE AUDITION ON THERE
JUST IN CASE.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.776
HOW ARE YOU GONNA LOOK LIKE
A 1960S DIAMOND THIEF

16:15.843 --> 16:17.845
WHEN YOU'RE STUCK
IN AN OFFICE CHAIR?

16:17.911 --> 16:19.713
GIRL, IT'S CALLED ACTING.
CHECK IT.

16:22.549 --> 16:25.485
NO ONE WILL CATCH ME
HERE ON THE CANAL.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.426
I'M A DIAMOND THIEF
ON THE RUN--

16:32.492 --> 16:34.294
ON THE ROLL.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.632
IN A STORAGE ROOM.

16:38.699 --> 16:41.268
HOW AM I GONNA MAKE
THIS LOOK REAL?

16:41.335 --> 16:44.872
THEY'LL NEVER CATCH ME HERE
ON THE CANALS OF VENICE, ITALY.

16:45.873 --> 16:48.208
DID YOU GET THAT?

16:48.275 --> 16:50.611
-<i>JO.</i>
- I'M SORRY.
I WAS CHECKING MY EMAIL.

16:52.379 --> 16:56.016
AND ACTION.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.652
CAN I<i>PLEASE</i>PRESS
THE BLUE BUTTON?

16:58.719 --> 17:01.421
IF THEY JUST MOVED
THOSE BOXES,

17:01.488 --> 17:03.891
THEY COULD HAVE USED
MY OLD GONDOLA.

17:10.631 --> 17:12.399
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
THEY COULD WORK.

17:12.466 --> 17:14.735
THAT KIND OF
LOOKS LIKE VENICE.

17:14.801 --> 17:17.838
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
IT LOOKS HORRIBLE.

17:17.905 --> 17:21.208
HEY, I DON'T NEED TO BE NICE
TO PEOPLE WHO ARE PLANNING
TO EAT ME.

17:21.275 --> 17:24.044
( CELL PHONE RINGS )

17:24.111 --> 17:27.014
- LEO, WHERE ARE YOU GUYS?
-<i>WE'RE GETTING CLOSE.</i>

17:27.080 --> 17:30.050
- THEY'RE ALMOST HERE.
- NO, WE'RE NOT.
WE'RE STILL AT SCHOOL.

17:30.117 --> 17:32.219
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE
UNLOCKING THE DOOR.

17:32.286 --> 17:34.087
THE DOOR?
JUST HACK THE KEYPAD.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.223
WE'RE WORKING
ON THE BIGGER PROBLEM.

17:36.290 --> 17:38.225
WHAT BIGGER PROBLEM?

17:38.292 --> 17:41.728
GETTING GEORGIA'S DRESS
UNSTUCK.

17:41.795 --> 17:45.265
- ASK HER IF SHE'S
DOUBLE JOINTED.
- OH, YEAH.

17:45.332 --> 17:48.402
THE DRESS?
THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
WASTING YOUR TIME ON?

17:48.468 --> 17:50.137
HEY HEY, WE MADE
EXCELLENT TIME

17:50.204 --> 17:54.074
CONSIDERING I HAD TO MATCH
THE FABRIC AND THEN SEW IT
WITHOUT A PATTERN.

17:56.343 --> 17:59.146
HELLO? JO.

17:59.213 --> 18:03.217
ALL RIGHT,
PLAN "D."

18:04.618 --> 18:07.087
I KNOW THIS
SOUNDS DRASTIC,

18:07.154 --> 18:10.090
BUT IF I COULD GET A MATCH
AND USE THAT SCUBA TANK,

18:10.157 --> 18:12.593
I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT I COULD BLAST US
OUT OF HERE.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.528
JO, JUST FORGET IT, OKAY?

18:14.595 --> 18:17.097
IT'S TOO LATE ANYWAY,
REALLY.

18:17.164 --> 18:20.133
AND YOU KNOW, IT DIDN'T
HAVE TO GO DOWN LIKE THIS.

18:20.200 --> 18:23.337
I HAD EVERYTHING
I COULD POSSIBLY WANT.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.972
THEN I JUST SAW SOMETHING

18:25.038 --> 18:26.807
SO SHINY AND PRETTY

18:26.874 --> 18:29.576
AND I COULDN'T
HELP MYSELF.

18:31.245 --> 18:33.213
I HAD TO SNEAK IN AND GET IT,
AND LOOK WHERE IT GOT ME--

18:33.280 --> 18:36.216
LOCKED UP, CUT OFF.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.385
ANOTHER DREAM
JUST SLIPS AWAY.

18:38.452 --> 18:41.555
BUT I DESERVE IT, RIGHT?

18:41.622 --> 18:43.957
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

18:44.024 --> 18:47.961
AUNT HONEY:
<i>ABOUT TIME YOU</i>
<i>LEARNED YOUR LESSON.</i>

18:48.028 --> 18:50.464
GOD?

18:50.531 --> 18:53.467
I GO BY MANY NAMES.

18:56.436 --> 18:59.106
HEY!

18:59.173 --> 19:01.842
YOU LOOK PRETTY.

19:03.577 --> 19:06.013
AND SO YOUNG.

19:06.079 --> 19:09.116
AND FORGIVING.

19:09.183 --> 19:11.051
WHERE'S MY DRESS?

19:11.118 --> 19:14.755
IT'S RIGHT WHERE
I FOUND IT--
UNHARMED.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.057
WHAT ABOUT MY CHAIR,
MY SWORD,

19:17.124 --> 19:19.693
MY BOTTLE OF WINE?

19:19.760 --> 19:22.429
WE ARE REALLY
REALLY SORRY.

19:22.496 --> 19:24.965
THEN YOU MAY BOTH SIT.

19:25.032 --> 19:27.968
ACTUALLY, I THINK I'M GOOD
ON THE SITTING FOR TONIGHT.

19:28.035 --> 19:29.603
THANK YOU.

19:29.670 --> 19:32.673
I'M SORRY THAT
WE DIDN'T GET YOUR
AUDITION TAPE IN ON TIME.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.441
THAT'S OKAY.
I'M SURE THERE WERE THOUSANDS.

19:34.508 --> 19:36.043
MINE WOULDN'T HAVE
STOOD OUT ANYWAY.

19:36.109 --> 19:38.345
NO, TRUST ME.
IT LOOKED GREAT.

19:38.412 --> 19:39.847
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:39.913 --> 19:42.816
I HAVE FOUR HIGH-DEF
SECURITY CAMERAS.

19:42.883 --> 19:46.353
WIDE SHOTS, CLOSE-UPS,
EVERYTHING.

19:46.420 --> 19:49.089
WAIT, SO YOU SAW
THAT WHOLE PART

19:49.156 --> 19:50.858
WHEN I WAS ROLLING AROUND
ON THE CHAIR?

19:50.924 --> 19:52.526
NO, THAT WAS HORRIBLE.

19:53.961 --> 19:56.864
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE LITTLE
SPEECH YOU MADE AT THE END.

19:56.930 --> 19:58.365
THAT WAS JUST ME TALKING.

19:58.432 --> 20:01.001
I WASN'T TRYING TO PRETEND
I WAS SOME JEWEL THIEF
GOING STRAIGHT.

20:01.068 --> 20:04.805
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
HOW SHINY THINGS ALWAYS
GET YOU IN TROUBLE,

20:04.872 --> 20:06.974
WISHING YOU COULD
STOP YOURSELF.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.842
IT WAS POWERFUL STUFF.

20:08.909 --> 20:11.211
SO I JUST SAVED IT
AS A QUICKTIME

20:11.278 --> 20:13.180
AND JUST SENT IT ON IN.

20:13.247 --> 20:16.083
- THANK YOU, AUNT HONEY.
- MM-HMM.

20:17.251 --> 20:19.152
I WOULD HAVE PUT IN
SOME FADES.

20:19.219 --> 20:22.256
DID THAT.
CREDITS TOO.

20:22.322 --> 20:26.193
REALLY? THOSE TAKE
FOREVER TO RENDER.

20:26.260 --> 20:27.761
THANK YOU, AUNT HONEY.

20:27.828 --> 20:30.998
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID ALL THAT FOR ME
EVEN THOUGH I DISOBEYED YOU.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.766
FAMILY'S FAMILY,
ALL RIGHT?

20:32.833 --> 20:35.235
WHEN SOMEONE'S
REALLY IN TROUBLE,

20:35.302 --> 20:38.038
WE STICK TOGETHER.
WE DON'T ASK QUESTIONS.

20:38.105 --> 20:41.642
- WE HELP EACH OTHER OUT.
- ABSOLUTELY.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.877
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE GOING DOWN
TO THE POLICE STATION

20:43.944 --> 20:46.113
AND YOU'RE TELLING THEM
YOU HIT A HOT DOG CART.

20:46.180 --> 20:48.315
WHAT?

20:48.382 --> 20:51.718
MR. HAGOBIAN HAS MORE
FRIENDS THAN I THOUGHT.

20:59.826 --> 21:03.197
THANKS FOR COMING TO BRUNCH.
IT HELPS TO TALK
TO OTHER SURVIVORS.

21:03.263 --> 21:06.233
ALL WE DID WAS HANG OUT
IN A ROOM FOR TWO HOURS.

21:06.300 --> 21:09.670
THE BIGGEST THREAT WAS
STEPPING IN YOUR PEE.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.972
THE VOICE OF GOD
STARTLED ME.

21:12.039 --> 21:14.842
- WE DID IT!
- I'M OUT!
I'M FINALLY OUT!

21:14.908 --> 21:17.878
OKAY, WE NEED TO CALL
GEORGIA AND JO--

21:17.945 --> 21:20.881
OOOH, MAYBE WE
SHOULD HAVE CALLED YOU
WHEN WE GOT OUT.

21:20.948 --> 21:23.884
I DID.
I CALLED LEO
LAST NIGHT.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.655
OH, LIKE YOU DIDN'T
HAVE FUN.

21:30.958 --> 21:32.960
<i>( THEME MUSIC PLAYING )</i>
