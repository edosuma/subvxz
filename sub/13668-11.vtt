00:01.000 --> 00:03.000
Shirley, open up the Cabinet for me
will you, please?

00:03.000 --> 00:05.080
Shirley, open up the Cabinet for me
will you, please?

00:05.080 --> 00:06.560
I never should have released drugs
to White without a prescription.

00:06.560 --> 00:09.000
I never should have released drugs
to White without a prescription.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.960
I'm being punished so you look good.

00:10.960 --> 00:11.800
I think I'm...

00:11.800 --> 00:13.040
I think I'm...

00:13.040 --> 00:15.280
You're going to want me to have kids.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.080
Victor, I'm afraid I'm confused.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.280
Watch this,
just broke into your computer.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.240
This man has access
to all our records,

00:21.240 --> 00:23.920
accounting, maintenance,
patient files, you name it.

00:23.920 --> 00:26.000
Tonight, on St Elsewhere...

00:26.000 --> 00:26.760
Any news of Dr Craig?

00:26.760 --> 00:28.760
Any news of Dr Craig?

00:28.760 --> 00:31.680
Dr Craig! Frostbite.

00:31.680 --> 00:34.720
Lancaster suspects some genius
entered his programme

00:34.720 --> 00:36.520
into our system.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.240
Sorry, Mr Jeffries, almost done.

00:38.240 --> 00:41.680
Fishing trip's going to be a heap
a lot harder with just one leg.

00:41.680 --> 00:42.880
You can do it.

00:42.880 --> 00:45.880
When I came back later to check
his vital signs he was cold.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.000
It was probably a
reaction to the Demerol,

00:48.000 --> 00:49.960
why wasn't that
noted in the computer?

00:49.960 --> 00:52.080
He's proposing marriage to you.

00:52.080 --> 00:52.840
I accept.

00:52.840 --> 00:53.920
I accept.

00:53.920 --> 00:54.920
Mazel tov.

00:54.920 --> 00:58.920
Mazel tov.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.640
Nine inches at Logan airport.

02:54.640 --> 02:57.160
16 inches at Bluehills Conservatory.

02:57.160 --> 02:58.360
No letup in sight.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.520
PHONE RINGS

03:00.520 --> 03:04.520
Unless you absolutely must
travel today, don't.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.720
Hello?

03:09.720 --> 03:13.000
Oh, hi, Donald.
How do you like the weather?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.280
Uh huh.

03:15.280 --> 03:19.280
No, he's getting dressed.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.320
You're kidding!

03:21.320 --> 03:25.320
Nothing like arriving in style.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.000
Sure, I'll let him know.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.440
OK, bye-bye.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.800
Ellen, Sam's fireplace is
filled with snow.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.040
I noticed, I noticed.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.200
Meaning you forgot to close
the damper.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.280
We've been through this before.

03:37.280 --> 03:40.680
Not only is it messy,
it sends the heating bills sky-high.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.800
Well, you're the one that wanted
a nice, roaring fire.

03:43.800 --> 03:47.160
That's last night, and just coffee.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.800
Did you hear the weather report?

03:48.800 --> 03:50.520
It's the worst storm in six years,

03:50.520 --> 03:52.960
it's about a foot
and a half in some places.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.560
Why don't you stay home today?

03:54.560 --> 03:58.240
Because I've got two angina patients
waiting for me at St Eligius.

03:58.240 --> 04:01.320
Well, according to the radio,
all the streets are in lousy shape.

04:01.320 --> 04:04.440
That's news? They hadn't been
in good shape since Eisenhower.

04:04.440 --> 04:06.520
Donald Westphall called,

04:06.520 --> 04:10.200
said the city had arranged for an
army truck to pick you doctors up,

04:10.200 --> 04:12.000
it's going to be here about 10.30.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.400
Now, that's almost
two hours from now,

04:15.400 --> 04:19.399
the last time I wrote a convoy
was Korea, 1952.

04:20.399 --> 04:23.560
Not an experience I want to repeat.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.440
I'll drive.

04:25.440 --> 04:26.960
Well, at least call me
when you get there.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.240
Well, at least call me
when you get there.

04:28.240 --> 04:32.240
So I won't worry.

04:37.840 --> 04:41.400
Look at her, I've never been
so torn up over anyone before.

04:41.400 --> 04:45.400
You Americans always stress the
physical, give the metaphysical try.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.560
Like what, read
the I Ching together?

04:47.560 --> 04:48.800
Like what, read
the I Ching together?

04:48.800 --> 04:51.880
The Great Mandala is hovering.

04:51.880 --> 04:54.960
Mutual happiness can be yours,
the karma is right.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.400
It is, are you serious?

04:56.400 --> 04:58.200
Yes.

04:58.200 --> 05:02.200
OK, OK, buddy. Here goes.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.880
Roberta, let's have lunch.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.000
Victor, I can't. I'm working.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.480
But it's my treat, honey,

05:07.480 --> 05:11.080
and besides, besides,
the Great Mandala is ours.

05:11.080 --> 05:12.320
Pardon me?

05:12.320 --> 05:15.240
Our mutual true being,
we can be so happy.

05:15.240 --> 05:16.920
Victor, how can you say that?

05:16.920 --> 05:19.080
Whenever we're together
I make you crazy.

05:19.080 --> 05:21.840
OK, but now the karma
is totally right.

05:21.840 --> 05:25.160
Victor, I haven't understood
a single word you've said.

05:25.160 --> 05:29.160
Now, is that any
basis for a relationship?

05:29.600 --> 05:33.600
Dr Weiss is right, bye.

05:33.640 --> 05:37.640
Weiss, if Weiss knew everything
he wouldn't be working here.

05:39.680 --> 05:41.440
And you, thanks a lot, pal,

05:41.440 --> 05:43.480
I hope your karma gets
stuck in the parking lot.

05:43.480 --> 05:47.480
I hope your karma gets
stuck in the parking lot.

05:48.160 --> 05:50.760
OK, now, take it easy,
take it easy, watch your leg.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.840
OK, put your weight on me, easy.

05:52.840 --> 05:54.320
Oh, you're on my foot,
you're on my foot.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.840
Oh, you're on my foot,
you're on my foot.

05:55.840 --> 05:57.240
You gaining weight?

05:57.240 --> 05:58.800
Yeah.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.360
Ah, you see, there's nothing to it.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.040
It was a lot easier at your place.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.800
Well, you're the one who dragged me
to the hospital.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.600
Well, you're the one who dragged me
to the hospital.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.000
Your leg was getting worse,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.440
cellulitis is nothing to fool around
with, you had to come in.

06:11.440 --> 06:14.640
cellulitis is nothing to fool around
with, you had to come in.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.680
I shouldn't be doing this,
you're supposed to lie still.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.840
And stay cooped up in this room?

06:19.840 --> 06:22.720
Harrison, it's only been two days.

06:22.720 --> 06:25.120
Well, it seems a whole lot longer
than that to me.

06:25.120 --> 06:28.440
Oh, boy, if Dr Armstrong catches me

06:28.440 --> 06:32.440
I'm going to be head of the bed
pan collection.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.160
Now, you warm enough?

06:35.160 --> 06:36.480
Now, you warm enough?

06:36.480 --> 06:37.880
And you sure your leg doesn't hurt?

06:37.880 --> 06:39.840
And you sure your leg doesn't hurt?

06:39.840 --> 06:43.240
That snow out there is something,
isn't it? Wish I was out there in it.

06:43.240 --> 06:46.400
Harrison, that's not a couple
of snowflakes, it's a blizzard.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.920
You sound just like your dad,

06:47.920 --> 06:50.560
the moment winter come
he wanted to hibernate too.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.080
And he was a worry wart.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.840
Oh, so, you saying I complain a lot?

06:53.840 --> 06:55.600
Yesterday you got bent out of shape

06:55.600 --> 06:56.640
cos they wouldn't let
you have a day off.

06:56.640 --> 06:58.720
cos they wouldn't let
you have a day off.

06:58.720 --> 07:01.200
You spent it with me anyhow.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.120
Luther, where are you going?

07:03.120 --> 07:05.000
Oh, I was looking for you,
Dr Armstrong.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.040
Oh, I was looking for you,
Dr Armstrong.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.280
Right, right, got you.

07:09.280 --> 07:10.440
Told you she'd find us.

07:10.440 --> 07:14.440
She likes me,
she just hates to admit it.

07:22.760 --> 07:24.720
Hello, Jack.

07:24.720 --> 07:27.560
I know this is a crazy day,
what with the blizzard and all.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.400
What is it?

07:29.400 --> 07:32.520
My parents at me to come home
and visit for a while.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.280
Good idea, I think you should.

07:34.280 --> 07:37.680
You know, you've been so good
about rearranging things,

07:37.680 --> 07:39.560
I don't want to cause any
more trouble with my schedule.

07:39.560 --> 07:43.360
I don't want to cause any
more trouble with my schedule.

07:43.360 --> 07:46.920
I haven't been to Seattle for more
than a week in the past ten years.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.800
They're dying to see Pete.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.680
Take care of him for a while,

07:50.680 --> 07:52.840
probably do a better job
than I have.

07:52.840 --> 07:56.680
Now, come on, you haven't done
so badly.

07:56.680 --> 07:57.840
You all right?

07:57.840 --> 07:58.880
Huh?

07:58.880 --> 08:02.880
See you later.

08:19.480 --> 08:23.480
I told you before, Mrs Bastino,
the window stays closed.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.560
Now, please, get back into bed, OK?

08:25.560 --> 08:27.240
You doctors are all alike.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.280
I'm a nurse.

08:28.280 --> 08:32.280
Same difference.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.679
Makes you long for the gore
of the emergency room, doesn't it?

08:34.679 --> 08:36.799
Makes you long for the gore
of the emergency room, doesn't it?

08:36.799 --> 08:38.520
Look on the bright side, Shirley,

08:38.520 --> 08:41.520
the hearing for White's
entrapment case comes up next week,

08:41.520 --> 08:44.880
once you're cleared the nursing board
will send you back down to ER.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.160
I hope.

08:46.160 --> 08:50.160
Thanks, Mrs Fetachgo, I'll come see
you tomorrow, and, uh, stay warm.

09:04.920 --> 09:08.000
You may be right, it's not even
the big issue any more,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.360
whether I fail to keep an accurate
medication count.

09:10.360 --> 09:11.560
whether I fail to keep an accurate
medication count.

09:11.560 --> 09:13.240
I did a lot of good work down in ER,

09:13.240 --> 09:16.360
but I get the feeling
Helen Rosenthal doesn't remember it.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.520
Well, why don't you talk to her?

09:17.520 --> 09:18.600
Well, why don't you talk to her?

09:18.600 --> 09:22.600
Well, it couldn't hurt.

09:28.640 --> 09:29.920
Morning.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.720
Ah, I don't believe kids nowadays,

09:31.720 --> 09:34.600
I was halfway up Colmar Avenue
starting up from the light,

09:34.600 --> 09:37.640
and five of them jumped out
and grabbed onto my rear bumper.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.560
It's called sketching, you hang on,

09:39.560 --> 09:42.280
then when the car takes off you
slide along your feet.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.520
It's like waterskiing.

09:43.520 --> 09:46.440
I noticed, I turned the corner
and they jumped off and slid off.

09:46.440 --> 09:48.560
Looks like fun,
if a little dangerous.

09:48.560 --> 09:49.640
Ah, Helen.

09:49.640 --> 09:50.600
What's all this about?

09:50.600 --> 09:54.080
What's all this about?

09:54.080 --> 09:57.160
Did anyone think to call
Walter Lankau Deficiency Systems?

09:57.160 --> 09:58.640
BOTH: No.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.200
But before the computer quit,

10:00.200 --> 10:02.920
Lucy found these names
floating around by themselves,

10:02.920 --> 10:05.400
no records or histories.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.880
Garfield, Wilson, Adams, Grant.

10:08.880 --> 10:12.880
Presidents?

11:04.400 --> 11:08.160
# You'll find the sand dunes
and salty air

11:08.160 --> 11:11.800
# Quaint little villages
here and there. #

11:11.800 --> 11:13.360
I don't believe this weather.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.040
I don't believe this singing,

11:15.040 --> 11:19.040
I wonder if the sergeant upfront
knows where we're going.

11:24.240 --> 11:25.280
See you later.

11:25.280 --> 11:29.280
Bye, ladies.

11:31.680 --> 11:35.680
WOMAN SIGHS

11:43.040 --> 11:46.520
I thought changing the password
meant that no hackers could break in

11:46.520 --> 11:47.680
from the outside.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.200
Well, Walter Lankau suspects

11:49.200 --> 11:51.960
that some genius entered
his own programme into our system.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.880
Apparently they think it's loads
of fun to infiltrate hospitals,

11:54.880 --> 11:56.440
corporations, you name it.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.440
Any chance we can get Lankau
over here today?

11:58.440 --> 12:00.560
Oh, no, I don't think so,
not with these roads.

12:00.560 --> 12:02.880
Anyway, he said
that the only deterrent

12:02.880 --> 12:06.880
is a foolproof security system
which runs around ¤10,000.

12:07.320 --> 12:10.440
Oh, wonderful, why not(?)
That's a bargain, right?

12:10.440 --> 12:14.440
I don't know, maybe it was
doomed from the beginning.

12:14.920 --> 12:17.800
You're not going to blame
it on fate, are you?

12:17.800 --> 12:20.000
I mean, nobody knows
if there is such a thing.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.040
Oh, yeah? How many successful
relationships you know

12:23.040 --> 12:25.120
that got started
during a rinse cycle?

12:25.120 --> 12:26.200
Well, that doesn't necessarily...

12:26.200 --> 12:27.560
Well, that doesn't necessarily...

12:27.560 --> 12:30.680
This whole romance business
is for the birds, OK?

12:30.680 --> 12:33.280
I've made every attempt
to be unfettered and un-phoney.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.320
I even hid in her closet
until she came home,

12:35.320 --> 12:37.920
then I burst out, completely naked.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.080
Wrong choice, huh?

12:39.080 --> 12:40.720
(SNICKERS) Wrong choice.

12:40.720 --> 12:44.160
Do me one favour, OK?
Because I've tried being liberated,

12:44.160 --> 12:46.760
I've played Mr Natural,
I've put on the dog.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.200
I even took a shot at proposing.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.240
I screwed all of them up,
so will you help?

12:50.240 --> 12:50.960
How?

12:50.960 --> 12:54.280
How?

12:54.280 --> 12:56.640
No, I can't do a thing like that.

12:56.640 --> 12:59.120
Will you talk to Weiss, then,
one therapist to another?

12:59.120 --> 13:00.960
That's kosher.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.960
I don't know, I'll...

13:03.960 --> 13:05.400
I'll think that over, OK?

13:05.400 --> 13:06.920
OK.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.200
What, you're leaving?

13:08.200 --> 13:11.240
Well, because of the blizzard,
all my sessions are cancelled.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.560
You're lucky,
you live only four blocks from here.

13:13.560 --> 13:17.560
My apartment's halfway
to Rhode Island.

13:23.480 --> 13:25.720
Slides of your baby?

13:25.720 --> 13:27.280
Hello, Fiscus.

13:27.280 --> 13:30.080
So word has it that you're
going to be Cavanero's guest

13:30.080 --> 13:32.720
in the endoscopy suite today.

13:32.720 --> 13:35.280
She said Tony and I could come by
and watch.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.480
You don't seem very excited.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.000
Come to think of it,

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
you've been kind of out
in left field lately. What's up?

13:43.400 --> 13:46.000
For the past 20 minutes,
I've been hiding in here,

13:46.000 --> 13:49.200
wishing I didn't have to go back
out in the hallway.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.240
It's like the rest
of the hospital's at 78,

13:51.240 --> 13:54.000
and I'm still at 33-and-a-third.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.800
Jack, it-it takes time to readjust.

13:56.800 --> 14:00.760
How long?

14:00.760 --> 14:04.440
Sometimes I think everything's
just slipping through my fingers.

14:04.440 --> 14:07.320
I screw up one case after another.
The Brennan kid died,

14:07.320 --> 14:10.600
I blew the diagnosis of Janet Dalton.

14:10.600 --> 14:14.600
I don't know. So many things.

14:14.600 --> 14:18.600
Ah, I gotta go.

14:21.680 --> 14:24.160
You know, it happens
to the best of us.

14:24.160 --> 14:27.520
One day I stopped being funny.
I'm serious.

14:27.520 --> 14:31.040
I lost my timing, my sick sense
of humour, the whole ball of wax.

14:31.040 --> 14:32.520
The pressure was incredible.

14:32.520 --> 14:35.640
I mean, everyone expected me to be
zany and I just couldn't do it.

14:35.640 --> 14:37.080
I was too depressed.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.680
So what snapped you out of it?

14:38.680 --> 14:41.200
Luisa Renault.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.280
One afternoon we're all over each
other and she stops to ask me

14:44.280 --> 14:47.120
why I find her attractive.
So I told her.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.000
"You have great hair."

14:49.000 --> 14:51.640
"You are a very caring person."

14:51.640 --> 14:55.640
And Road And Track voted you
best ride in 1971.

14:55.800 --> 14:58.800
I think we should move upstream.

14:58.800 --> 15:02.640
You got to be patient, boy,
don't jerk around so much.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.480
Now keep that rod tip up, cos you
gonna lose some if you don't.

15:05.480 --> 15:08.240
I don't think there's any fish here,
just mosquitoes.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.560
There ain't gonna be no fish here
if you don't hush up

15:10.560 --> 15:12.040
and stop scaring them off.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.480
Well, maybe I need a new worm.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.800
(LAUGHS) Worm!

15:14.800 --> 15:18.040
Boy, we're fishing with
grasshoppers, that's better bait.

15:18.040 --> 15:19.400
Ah...

15:19.400 --> 15:20.920
You got one, you got one!

15:20.920 --> 15:21.960
I do?

15:21.960 --> 15:24.640
Yeah, you got yourself a bass,
that's a ten pounder.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.960
Oh. How big was the biggest one
my daddy ever caught?

15:26.960 --> 15:30.520
Oh, your daddy, let's see,
he caught a 29, 30 pounder, boy,

15:30.520 --> 15:33.200
but you're talking about somebody
that could do some fishing.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.240
He could!

15:34.240 --> 15:36.920
And he didn't want this filament rod
or any of that fancy stuff.

15:36.920 --> 15:40.920
Just give him a plain old rod and
he'd use that old fishing know-how.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.160
Well, this is at least 30.

15:42.160 --> 15:44.640
All right, but you got to
give him room, give him some room,

15:44.640 --> 15:46.800
give him slack now!
You're going the wrong...

15:46.800 --> 15:48.440
That's a boy!

15:48.440 --> 15:50.160
Watch my lines!

15:50.160 --> 15:52.920
(LAUGHS) I told you to give him
some room, didn't I?

15:52.920 --> 15:54.840
Tough break, Luther.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.080
How are you feeling?

15:56.080 --> 15:57.520
Oh, all right, I suppose.

15:57.520 --> 15:58.720
Any pain in your leg?

15:58.720 --> 15:59.840
Mm, some.

15:59.840 --> 16:02.680
I'm going to have to check the
dressing and take another culture.

16:02.680 --> 16:05.880
All right. Do you ever do
any fishing, Dr Armstrong?

16:05.880 --> 16:07.640
Once with my brother.

16:07.640 --> 16:09.200
I didn't like it very much.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.600
Well, maybe you never learned
how to read the water

16:11.600 --> 16:13.440
and find out where the fishes is!
(LAUGHS)

16:13.440 --> 16:14.520
How do you do that?

16:14.520 --> 16:16.000
Oh, you got to use your fish sense.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.400
You see, you got to know
what the fish is seeing, hearing

16:18.400 --> 16:20.840
and thinking. Just like I do
with my pigeon, Julius.

16:20.840 --> 16:22.120
Soon as the snow falls,

16:22.120 --> 16:24.360
me and this boy here going up
to Lake Winnipesaukee

16:24.360 --> 16:26.840
to do some serious fishing.
You're welcome to come along,

16:26.840 --> 16:28.160
if you want to.
Where's that?

16:28.160 --> 16:30.920
Lake Winnipesaukee? That's the
biggest lake in New Hampshire.

16:30.920 --> 16:31.960
(GROANS)

16:31.960 --> 16:35.960
Sorry, Mr Jeffries. I'm almost done.

16:37.520 --> 16:39.760
Finished.

16:39.760 --> 16:42.520
I'll send the nurse down
to apply a fresh dressing.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.240
How's it look?

16:44.240 --> 16:47.480
We'll know more
when I get the culture results.

16:47.480 --> 16:49.440
Well, is it any better?

16:49.440 --> 16:53.240
The cellulitis isn't too good.

16:53.240 --> 16:56.040
Mr Jeffries,
if there's no change in a few days,

16:56.040 --> 17:00.040
we may have to consider
what we talked about.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.599
I'll stop by late this afternoon.

17:04.599 --> 17:08.599
Good fishing, huh?

17:10.599 --> 17:14.599
Fishing's trip's going to be...
be a lot harder with one leg.

17:16.359 --> 17:20.359
We can do it.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.079
Are you with me, Jack?

17:24.079 --> 17:25.160
Yeah, I think so.

17:25.160 --> 17:26.760
Keep your eyes peeled.

17:26.760 --> 17:28.560
See the GE junction?

17:28.560 --> 17:30.360
Yeah, it's inflamed, isn't it?

17:30.360 --> 17:33.560
Good contractions. No inflammation.

17:33.560 --> 17:35.520
Would you say the stomach
is hyperaemic?

17:35.520 --> 17:37.280
Uh-huh.

17:37.280 --> 17:38.920
Yes.

17:38.920 --> 17:42.080
Blood vessels dilated,
rugal folds normal.

17:42.080 --> 17:45.600
Considerable scarring
in the duodenal bulb.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.720
Any bleeding?

17:47.720 --> 17:51.240
I...don't see any.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.320
Well, minimal.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.280
You're one step closer, Mrs Campion.

17:55.280 --> 17:56.600
Get some rest.

17:56.600 --> 18:00.600
Kyle, I'll be right back.
Start withdrawing the tube.

18:06.680 --> 18:09.280
Three days of tests
and I still don't have a clue.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.680
Now what?

18:10.680 --> 18:13.040
(SIGHS) Maybe I'll bring Wylie in
for a consult.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.560
I'll go to Westphall.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.240
You really want to do that?

18:16.240 --> 18:19.320
What would you suggest?
Invent a disease for her?

18:19.320 --> 18:20.600
No.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.400
But don't you want to make
the diagnosis on your own?

18:23.400 --> 18:25.280
A little teamwork doesn't hurt.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.720
All that matters is that the patient
gets better,

18:27.720 --> 18:29.520
not who gets the credit.

18:29.520 --> 18:30.920
I guess you're right.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.520
There are worse things that can
happen than not solving a case

18:33.520 --> 18:34.880
by yourself.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.720
(LAUGHS) Like what?

18:36.720 --> 18:39.600
The roof could cave in.

18:39.600 --> 18:43.600
Sorry I wasn't more help back there.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.600
(MAN ON RADIO) ..in areas
far removed from city centre,

18:50.600 --> 18:52.320
which is having enough
troubles of its own.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.920
which is having enough
troubles of its own.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.040
Hear anything from Mark?

18:55.040 --> 18:56.720
Not yet, but we've got an emergency.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.560
A city bus just skidded on the ice
and overturned on the street.

18:59.560 --> 19:00.160
Oh, no.

19:00.160 --> 19:01.920
Oh, no.

19:01.920 --> 19:04.480
but a few have cuts and bruises.
This is the nearest shelter,

19:04.480 --> 19:05.800
so they're going to be
walking in here any minute.

19:05.800 --> 19:06.880
so they're going to be
walking in here any minute.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.520
I think 30, half of them are kids.

19:08.520 --> 19:11.040
All right, let's put them
in the admissions lobby.

19:11.040 --> 19:12.400
We'll need blankets, hot soup.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.280
And I'll check and see
how many cots we have.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.360
Thanks.

19:16.360 --> 19:18.880
(MAN ON RADIO) While Boston copes
with record snowfalls,

19:18.880 --> 19:22.320
the southern coast of Maine and the
Portsmouth area of New Hampshire

19:22.320 --> 19:26.320
are facing highly dangerous roads
caused by sleet, snow...

19:26.600 --> 19:28.400
I'm never going to find
those records!

19:28.400 --> 19:29.760
Keep trying.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.920
I've got to give my eyes a rest.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.280
Helen, can we talk for a minute?

19:34.280 --> 19:38.280
Yeah, sure, come on in.

19:49.080 --> 19:50.600
What's the matter?

19:50.600 --> 19:52.880
You don't trust me.

19:52.880 --> 19:56.080
Why do you say that?

19:56.080 --> 19:59.120
Just because I didn't keep an
accurate medication count one night,

19:59.120 --> 20:01.080
you had me transferred from the ER.

20:01.080 --> 20:03.000
And now you make me stay behind
the counter,

20:03.000 --> 20:05.040
so I never get to deal
with any patients.

20:05.040 --> 20:07.640
I feel more like a receptionist
than anything else.

20:07.640 --> 20:11.080
Just a minute, Shirley,
do you want the cold, hard facts?

20:11.080 --> 20:12.520
At the head nurses' meeting,

20:12.520 --> 20:16.520
the majority of them wanted you
to go up before the review board.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.040
You know, I almost wish I had.

20:20.040 --> 20:22.880
At least I would've had a chance
to defend myself.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.480
Maybe I was wrong
to go out on a limb,

20:24.480 --> 20:27.120
but I told them I thought
it would be a terrible waste.

20:27.120 --> 20:29.920
So they agreed to let it slide
if you came up here.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.240
I'm a good nurse, Helen.

20:31.240 --> 20:35.240
You are. You've just got
a lot to learn.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.200
One more question.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.240
Will I ever get to go back
to the ER?

20:44.240 --> 20:48.240
Yeah. When you're ready.

You think the arm's broken?

21:45.120 --> 21:47.840
I hope it's only a sprain. I'd get
an AP and lateral on that elbow.

21:47.840 --> 21:48.680
What about her head?

21:48.680 --> 21:51.520
What about her head?

21:51.520 --> 21:54.360
And I want a neuro check
every two hours through the night.

21:54.360 --> 21:58.360
OK. Go easy, fellas. Come on.

I can't find this file for Dr Burke.
OK, baby. Ssh.

22:16.320 --> 22:19.160
Here, let me have him,
you're doing that all wrong.

22:19.160 --> 22:21.560
Oh, really(?)
I have raised kids of my own.

22:21.560 --> 22:24.160
Yeah, but I was the oldest,
and I helped raise three sisters

22:24.160 --> 22:27.040
and two brothers.
Think we need a little walk.

22:27.040 --> 22:30.040
Yeah. Women think they're
the only mothers around.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.520
Come on, Petey.

22:31.520 --> 22:35.520
Ah, here it is!

22:35.680 --> 22:36.880
You're welcome(!)

22:36.880 --> 22:39.160
Helen, could I see Mr Jeffries'
old chart, please?

22:39.160 --> 22:40.360
Jeffries, Je... Oh.

22:40.360 --> 22:43.600
Maybe we got lucky
and he made it into the computer.

22:43.600 --> 22:46.640
Oh, boy, I have hated this machine
from the start,

22:46.640 --> 22:49.000
and it's been downhill ever since.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.920
Here we go, Jeffries, Harrison,
what do you want to know?

22:51.920 --> 22:53.560
Any medication allergies?

22:53.560 --> 22:55.320
No.

22:55.320 --> 22:56.800
He still seems to be in pain,

22:56.800 --> 22:59.000
the tablets aren't doing
the trick any more.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.320
If he's not resting comfortably
in a couple of hours,

23:01.320 --> 23:05.240
I want you to give him 100 milligrams
Demerol and 50 of Vistaril IM.

23:05.240 --> 23:06.040
Yeah.

23:06.040 --> 23:07.080
Yeah.

23:07.080 --> 23:07.720
Thanks.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.040
Thanks.

23:09.040 --> 23:11.040
Victor.

23:11.040 --> 23:14.160
Hello, Victor.
Have you seen Dr Craig yet?

23:14.160 --> 23:15.640
Craig's late?

23:15.640 --> 23:17.360
Only about five hours.

23:17.360 --> 23:20.120
Wow, a chink in the old armour.
Even the mighty fall.

23:20.120 --> 23:22.920
Now don't gloat.
So when's the wedding?

23:22.920 --> 23:23.920
Huh?

23:23.920 --> 23:26.440
You and Roberta.
Have you set the date?

23:26.440 --> 23:30.440
I never want to hear
the word date again.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.160
Harrison, you awake?

23:35.160 --> 23:36.520
Yeah, come on in.

23:36.520 --> 23:38.080
Ah...

23:38.080 --> 23:40.680
(LAUGHS) Who's this you got here?

23:40.680 --> 23:43.240
It's Pete Morrison.
His dad's one of the residents.

23:43.240 --> 23:47.240
Well, come here.
You little rascal, you!

23:47.480 --> 23:50.600
Look at you!
Tell me something good.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.200
You know I got a grandson
who's about your size?

23:53.200 --> 23:55.320
He's back down in Carolina. Huh?

23:55.320 --> 23:57.840
And you know what,
he growed up not too far

23:57.840 --> 24:00.160
from where this boy's daddy
and I growed up.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.760
Yeah, real mill country.

24:01.760 --> 24:05.760
Oh, boy, me and your daddy
used to have some good times.

24:05.760 --> 24:09.680
Yeah. He was quite a guy.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.360
I'll tell you something.

24:11.360 --> 24:14.320
The older you get,
the more you miss people.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.320
They die...

24:16.320 --> 24:20.240
a lot of them move away.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.000
They die and they move away.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
There you go, you take care
of yourself, little fella.

24:26.040 --> 24:26.880
(GROANS)

24:26.880 --> 24:27.960
(GROANS)

24:27.960 --> 24:31.840
Yeah, most of the time I get
this strange kind of cold, you know?

24:31.840 --> 24:33.440
Yeah, well...

24:33.440 --> 24:36.080
must be nice weather
in Carolina all year round.

24:36.080 --> 24:38.000
Now you hush that, boy.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.320
Don't go bringing that up again,
because I promised your daddy

24:41.320 --> 24:43.920
the day before he died
that I'd keep my eyes on you.

24:43.920 --> 24:46.320
Now if I just upped
and went back down south,

24:46.320 --> 24:48.160
who knows what you'd be up to?

24:48.160 --> 24:50.720
Yeah, but you'd always know somehow.

24:50.720 --> 24:53.840
Yeah, but my next birthday,
I'll be getting on up there in age.

24:53.840 --> 24:57.840
When you get to a certain point,
people stop needing you as much.

24:59.040 --> 25:02.240
I need you.

25:02.240 --> 25:06.240
That's nice.

25:07.120 --> 25:09.920
Say goodbye, Pete.

25:09.920 --> 25:13.360
Bye.

25:13.360 --> 25:17.360
MUSIC PEALS FROM BAR

25:29.000 --> 25:30.600
One sherry.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.160
Thank you.

25:32.160 --> 25:35.160
Excuse me. Does your payphone work?

25:35.160 --> 25:36.680
Not since the '67 Series.

25:36.680 --> 25:37.800
Why, what happened?

25:37.800 --> 25:39.280
The Red Sox lost.

25:39.280 --> 25:41.720
See that guy over there
playing pool, Chuck DeMita?

25:41.720 --> 25:44.880
He tore the receiver
right off the wall.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.000
Amazing man.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
Yeah. Cheers.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.480
Oh, I don't believe it.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.960
Hey, there is fuzz on this table.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.800
No, there's no way my ball misses

25:56.800 --> 26:00.200
unless there's something wrong
with this felt.

26:00.200 --> 26:01.600
Hey, you!

26:01.600 --> 26:05.600
What do you say? Fuzz or no fuzz?

26:05.800 --> 26:07.200
Fuzz, definitely.

26:07.200 --> 26:11.200
Hear that, Mara?
Third world, he votes for fuzz.

26:12.720 --> 26:15.680
I saw you come in.
What, are you stuck or something?

26:15.680 --> 26:17.040
Yes, my wheels are spinning.

26:17.040 --> 26:20.320
Ah. Foreign car, huh?

26:20.320 --> 26:23.120
Hey, you're not Iranian, are you?
I mean, that Ayatollah...

26:23.120 --> 26:24.760
Indian.

26:24.760 --> 26:26.520
Oh, good, yeah.

26:26.520 --> 26:28.280
Well, how about a game
of three-ball?

26:28.280 --> 26:30.360
Um...

26:30.360 --> 26:32.400
I don't know how to play pool,
I'm afraid.

26:32.400 --> 26:34.880
Aw, come on,
you gotta try everything once.

26:34.880 --> 26:38.880
Hey, Mara! A round of drinks
for me and my buddy here.

26:43.040 --> 26:45.440
Come on, Mrs Pierce.

26:45.440 --> 26:46.680
Stop it.

26:46.680 --> 26:47.720
Oh, what now?

26:47.720 --> 26:50.920
OK. I just typed in Charlene Pierce.

26:50.920 --> 26:52.840
She's in for a hysterectomy.

26:52.840 --> 26:55.720
But these records say she's got
a chronic kidney condition.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.040
Well, you sure she wasn't misfiled?

26:57.040 --> 27:01.040
Well, you sure she wasn't misfiled?

27:01.920 --> 27:05.240
COMPUTER BEEPS

27:05.240 --> 27:06.640
Oh, you're right.

27:06.640 --> 27:10.320
I know Mrs Grant, half of her
profile has been deleted.

27:10.320 --> 27:11.360
OK.

27:11.360 --> 27:14.080
No information from this computer
is to be considered reliable

27:14.080 --> 27:15.200
until further notice.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.320
How do we manage?

27:16.320 --> 27:17.840
Call the other floors and tell them

27:17.840 --> 27:21.840
to keep records by hand until they
hear from us. I'll get Dr Westphall.

27:25.720 --> 27:29.720
HEAVY BREATHING

27:31.760 --> 27:35.760
Fresh air will do you good.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.680
I have such a headache.

27:40.680 --> 27:43.600
Sick people give off fumes.

27:43.600 --> 27:46.880
You got to get a lot of air,
let nature take its course.

27:46.880 --> 27:49.080
Like pneumonia?

27:49.080 --> 27:51.080
Oh, you'll feel better in no time.

27:51.080 --> 27:55.080
Believe it or not,
they wanted that window closed.

27:55.960 --> 27:59.960
Boy, I hate doctors!

28:03.360 --> 28:05.600
How's our prize casualty?

28:05.600 --> 28:07.640
Normal people have coronaries.

28:07.640 --> 28:09.000
And you get a roof on your head.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Mm.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.480
Actually, this is
a professional visit.

28:14.480 --> 28:18.480
First, I'll be covering for you
for a few days while you're laid up.

28:19.320 --> 28:20.960
Wayne, that's sweet of you.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.360
I know. And second,
I need to do a complete physical,

28:23.360 --> 28:25.800
so if you'll just slip off
that nightgown, um...

28:25.800 --> 28:26.880
Drop dead.

28:26.880 --> 28:28.320
You tell him, lady.

28:28.320 --> 28:31.240
Now you know what it's like in the
prone position. Just co-operate.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.480
If you try anything...

28:32.480 --> 28:34.520
I'm just going to check your lungs.

28:34.520 --> 28:35.960
Use a stethoscope.

28:35.960 --> 28:37.520
Don't talk, just breathe.

28:37.520 --> 28:39.200
(EXHALES)

28:39.200 --> 28:40.520
Again.

28:40.520 --> 28:42.240
(EXHALES)

28:42.240 --> 28:43.600
And again.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.720
(EXHALES) That's enough.

28:45.720 --> 28:47.640
Your chest is in great shape.

28:47.640 --> 28:49.280
It's my arm that's broken.

28:49.280 --> 28:51.160
Well, one has to be thorough.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.520
Now, if you can just give us
a urine sample, please.

28:53.520 --> 28:55.200
My right arm's fine, Fiscus.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.480
As to reflexes...

28:56.480 --> 28:58.000
They're fine too.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.280
Would you like to see
where I can put my knee?

29:00.280 --> 29:02.960
You know, you're starting
to sound better already.

29:02.960 --> 29:04.480
And you feel good to me too.

29:04.480 --> 29:06.640
Take your stethoscope and go.

29:06.640 --> 29:10.640
Relax, Doctor. Remember,
your beeper is in good hands.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.640
Doctor?!

29:13.640 --> 29:17.640
That's right.
And don't even touch that window.

29:17.920 --> 29:21.920
CHATTERING

29:25.600 --> 29:28.320
CHILDREN LAUGHING

29:28.320 --> 29:31.000
Oh, did you get those flowers
for Dr Cavanero's room?

29:31.000 --> 29:32.760
Yeah. But she was sleeping,

29:32.760 --> 29:34.840
and the other lady in the room
was a real pain.

29:34.840 --> 29:38.840
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, son,
this isn't the Kentucky Derby.

29:40.840 --> 29:43.960
One. I said one!

29:43.960 --> 29:45.880
Can't you go any faster, Jack?

29:45.880 --> 29:47.800
Guess what I just heard
on the radio.

29:47.800 --> 29:49.480
St Eligius is closed.

29:49.480 --> 29:51.720
(SNICKERS) Really(?)
Any news of Dr Craig?

29:51.720 --> 29:52.760
No, nothing.

29:52.760 --> 29:55.920
According to police, the problem is
that the visibility's down to zero.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.640
We're down to one
miserable doughnut.

29:57.640 --> 30:00.000
Joan Halloran's trying to get
a truckload of food over,

30:00.000 --> 30:00.800
it should be here soon.

30:00.800 --> 30:04.280
it should be here soon.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.800
Anything I can do?

30:05.800 --> 30:09.280
Here. Let me take care of this.

30:09.280 --> 30:10.440
Hey, get down!

30:10.440 --> 30:11.960
No, I want to use your phone!

30:11.960 --> 30:13.520
Hey, hey, all right, knock it off.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.640
He cut in line!

30:14.640 --> 30:16.360
OK. What's the matter?

30:16.360 --> 30:18.760
I want to call home.
I just got to try again.

30:18.760 --> 30:20.520
So do I, but I'm not crying
about it.

30:20.520 --> 30:21.560
Shut up.

30:21.560 --> 30:23.640
Hey, that's enough.

30:23.640 --> 30:26.400
Come on.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.760
Why don't you take a deep breath
and relax?

30:28.760 --> 30:29.840
Slowly.

30:29.840 --> 30:31.640
(EXHALES)

30:31.640 --> 30:33.240
OK, now what's the matter?

30:33.240 --> 30:36.000
I tried to call Mommy
and Daddy on the phone.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.520
But there was no answer.
And it didn't give my dime back.

30:39.520 --> 30:42.440
And I'm just scared
something happened to them.

30:42.440 --> 30:46.440
I'll bet you a dime they're OK.

30:52.200 --> 30:53.480
What's your name?

30:53.480 --> 30:54.760
Tucker.

30:54.760 --> 30:56.280
Ah, it's busy.

30:56.280 --> 30:58.040
Well, we'll wait right here
until we reach them.

30:58.040 --> 30:59.320
Well, we'll wait right here
until we reach them.

30:59.320 --> 31:00.960
Sure, Tucker.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.600
We're all in this together.

31:02.600 --> 31:06.080
I know blizzards are scary,
but they got their good sides too.

31:06.080 --> 31:07.840
Most times
they bring people together.

31:07.840 --> 31:10.720
Yeah. My dad always shovels
Mrs Shivelli's driveway

31:10.720 --> 31:12.520
every time it snows.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.880
Hello, Mom?

31:14.880 --> 31:17.120
Come on, Mrs Parks, be a sport.

31:17.120 --> 31:21.000
Right now, Dr Fiscus, that is
the farthest thing from my mind!

31:21.000 --> 31:23.080
You mean to tell me
you've never trayed?

31:23.080 --> 31:27.080
I've never even run. Give them back!

31:27.840 --> 31:31.520
Look, I was the 1966 sledding champ
of Washington Heights,

31:31.520 --> 31:33.640
but the traying sensation
was something else.

31:33.640 --> 31:36.120
It's twice the speed of a sled,
you spin around,

31:36.120 --> 31:37.520
there's wind in your ears.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.680
You sound like my husband
on the turnpike.

31:39.680 --> 31:40.960
Believe me, children love it

31:40.960 --> 31:43.280
and we've got several thousand
in the lobby right now.

31:43.280 --> 31:44.600
If you don't let me have these,

31:44.600 --> 31:46.320
I will send all the kids
to the cafeteria.

31:46.320 --> 31:48.600
I will send all the kids
to the cafeteria.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.240
You'll dry my trays off?

31:50.240 --> 31:51.760
I'll even throw in a free check-up.

31:51.760 --> 31:53.480
Just the trays, thank you.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.080
Excuse me. Dr Fiscus.

31:55.080 --> 31:55.920
Hi, Roberta.

31:55.920 --> 31:58.480
Hi, Roberta.

31:58.480 --> 32:00.200
I mean, you lived together
and all and...

32:00.200 --> 32:01.440
I mean, you lived together
and all and...

32:01.440 --> 32:03.120
This was just between apartments.

32:03.120 --> 32:06.400
Well, but you are friends.
I need some advice.

32:06.400 --> 32:07.440
OK.

32:07.440 --> 32:09.960
What's the matter, dear?

32:09.960 --> 32:11.440
I seem to drive Victor crazy.

32:11.440 --> 32:13.160
Maybe it's not you.

32:13.160 --> 32:15.720
Maybe his food groups are unbalanced.

32:15.720 --> 32:16.920
Food groups?

32:16.920 --> 32:20.920
Poor diet can ruin any disposition.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.840
Does Dr Ehrlich eat bacon?

32:22.840 --> 32:26.760
I'm not sure. I mean, we've never
really had breakfast together.

32:26.760 --> 32:29.840
Oh, cholesterol is the kiss of death.

32:29.840 --> 32:33.440
Do you eat fruit and vegetables
at the same meal?

32:33.440 --> 32:34.360
Sometimes.

32:34.360 --> 32:36.240
Sometimes.

32:36.240 --> 32:38.440
Some are incompatible.

32:38.440 --> 32:40.760
Like...like Victor and me.

32:40.760 --> 32:44.760
If you want to be happy,
eat right or eat out.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.160
I see.

32:48.160 --> 32:49.480
Well...

32:49.480 --> 32:53.000
thank you.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.440
Glad she took my advice.

32:54.440 --> 32:58.440
Don't you lose my trays!

33:00.600 --> 33:03.480
See, the problem with cowboy pool
is once you hit 45,

33:03.480 --> 33:07.480
then you can't sink your own ball.
So now you gotta go for billiards.

33:07.640 --> 33:10.880
I remember once in '75,
I was playing Spud Simpkins.

33:10.880 --> 33:13.320
Spud says to me, he says, "Goopy..."

33:13.320 --> 33:17.080
My name is Chuck,
but my friends, they call me Goopy.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.720
What do they call you?

33:18.720 --> 33:20.000
Oh, Vijay Kochar.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.160
Oh, yeah(!)
What does the VJ stand for?

33:22.160 --> 33:24.800
Um, Virendra Kumar...

33:24.800 --> 33:26.120
Oh, yeah.

33:26.120 --> 33:30.040
Anyway, back in '72, Goopy...

33:30.040 --> 33:31.680
Hey, we need some help here!

33:31.680 --> 33:33.520
&lt; (WOMAN) What's going on there?

33:33.520 --> 33:37.520
CHATTERING

33:38.400 --> 33:39.520
Dr Craig.

33:39.520 --> 33:40.960
You know this guy?

33:40.960 --> 33:43.400
Yes. We work together. St Eligius.
I know him well.

33:43.400 --> 33:44.680
You're a doctor?

33:44.680 --> 33:46.040
Out of the way, please.

33:46.040 --> 33:50.040
Extremities too cold.

33:50.960 --> 33:54.800
Frostbite.

33:54.800 --> 33:57.880
Hypothermia.
You did well to bring him in here.

33:57.880 --> 33:59.480
Kochar?

33:59.480 --> 34:00.520
What happened, Jay?

34:00.520 --> 34:02.880
His car was wrapped around
a light pole down the block.

34:02.880 --> 34:04.640
He must've been out cold
a long time.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.480
Don't worry, Dr Craig,
you're going to be all right.

34:06.480 --> 34:08.320
Don't worry, Dr Craig,
you're going to be all right.

34:08.320 --> 34:09.960
Your breath's terrible.

34:09.960 --> 34:13.960
Whisky, please.

34:19.159 --> 34:20.880
Thank you.

34:20.880 --> 34:22.880
Dr Craig?

34:22.880 --> 34:26.880
Just enough, please. Come.

34:26.920 --> 34:29.960
(COUGHS)

34:29.960 --> 34:33.960
Thank you.

34:34.639 --> 34:38.639
Excuse me.

34:46.480 --> 34:47.960
What the hell's he doing?

34:47.960 --> 34:50.239
Dr Craig, listen to me.

34:50.239 --> 34:53.600
Rest your feet on my stomach.

34:53.600 --> 34:54.960
Kochar...

34:54.960 --> 34:56.360
you're drunk.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.560
It is the warmest part of my body,
you must save your toes.

34:59.560 --> 35:01.760
So do as I say. Please.

35:01.760 --> 35:03.160
Come on.

35:03.160 --> 35:07.160
&lt; Glad it's not me.

35:11.080 --> 35:12.480
What happened?

35:12.480 --> 35:15.000
Mr Jeffries woke at 5:40
and said he was in pain.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.800
I gave him 100 milligrams
of Demerol and 50 of Vistaril,

35:17.800 --> 35:18.960
as per your instructions.

35:18.960 --> 35:21.320
When I came back a half-hour later
to check his vitals,

35:21.320 --> 35:22.160
he was cold.

35:22.160 --> 35:24.640
he was cold.

35:24.640 --> 35:26.040
Why wasn't that allergy
noted in the computer?

35:26.040 --> 35:28.040
Why wasn't that allergy
noted in the computer?

35:28.040 --> 35:32.040
How can you blame the machine, Helen?
That's a really lame excuse!

35:34.320 --> 35:38.320
Grant, Charlene Pierce,
Garfield. Adams.

35:39.280 --> 35:43.280
Harrison Jeffries.

36:08.280 --> 36:12.280
(WHISTLES)

36:40.280 --> 36:43.400
Si. You're just the man
I want to see.

36:43.400 --> 36:44.560
Can it wait, Michael?

36:44.560 --> 36:47.360
My carburettor died on me,
I've got an 8:30 session.

36:47.360 --> 36:48.560
It'll only take a minute.

36:48.560 --> 36:51.720
I wanted to ask you some questions
about Roberta Sloan.

36:51.720 --> 36:53.120
Are you interested in Roberta?

36:53.120 --> 36:54.480
Very.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.400
Michael,
she's been through an awful lot,

36:56.400 --> 36:58.680
I'm not sure she's ready
for another relationship.

36:58.680 --> 37:01.880
No, no, not me,
it's for Victor Ehrlich.

37:01.880 --> 37:04.480
Oh, him?

37:04.480 --> 37:05.520
Yeah.

37:05.520 --> 37:07.640
If there was ever a guy
head-over-heels in love,

37:07.640 --> 37:09.960
it's Ehrlich. Those two
are made for each other.

37:09.960 --> 37:11.040
Do you really think so?

37:11.040 --> 37:12.840
Oh, yeah, I'm positive.

37:12.840 --> 37:16.840
Besides, I don't know how many more
sessions I can take with him!

37:18.600 --> 37:22.080
You know, Pete...

37:22.080 --> 37:26.080
You and I have got something
in common.

37:26.360 --> 37:29.800
I lost my daddy a long time ago.

37:29.800 --> 37:33.800
And you just lost your mom.

37:35.160 --> 37:39.160
Well, when you're on your own...

37:40.760 --> 37:44.760
I don't know.

37:46.040 --> 37:50.040
Maybe I'll still get up
to Winnipesaukee.

37:50.600 --> 37:53.280
I can fish pretty good by now.

37:53.280 --> 37:55.640
BABY GURGLES

37:55.640 --> 37:58.440
Yeah.

37:58.440 --> 38:00.960
But maybe...

38:00.960 --> 38:04.960
..maybe-Maybe I could still use
a couple of lessons.

38:05.720 --> 38:09.680
If you wanted to.

38:09.680 --> 38:12.720
Then...

38:12.720 --> 38:15.400
..then I...

38:15.400 --> 38:18.360
Damn.

38:18.360 --> 38:20.320
You sure you don't mind?

38:20.320 --> 38:22.640
No problem, I'll be glad to help.

38:22.640 --> 38:25.040
I just figure Goodwill
could use Nina's clothes.

38:25.040 --> 38:27.720
Hey, what time you want me
to stop by?

38:27.720 --> 38:28.800
Around noon.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.000
I'll be there.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.440
You'll bring some boxes?

38:32.440 --> 38:33.480
Bye.

38:33.480 --> 38:35.640
Bye-bye. No, as soon as
they cleared the street,

38:35.640 --> 38:38.120
they got the bus passengers
out of here.

38:38.120 --> 38:41.320
I have never been so glad
to see a snow plough in my life.

38:41.320 --> 38:44.640
Ira, how late did Erin stay up?

38:44.640 --> 38:48.640
What? Oh, Ira,
she's leading you around by the nose.

38:49.440 --> 38:52.760
OK, I'll see you soon. Bye-bye.

38:52.760 --> 38:55.000
Hello.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.320
Can I help you?

38:57.320 --> 39:01.320
I got your message.

39:10.840 --> 39:12.520
Victor.

39:12.520 --> 39:14.040
You know Dr Weiss.

39:14.040 --> 39:15.960
Yeah, I do. I'm in kind of a hurry.

39:15.960 --> 39:17.840
Dr Ehrlich, be candid.

39:17.840 --> 39:21.120
Is it true that you harbour
a fear of authority figures?

39:21.120 --> 39:23.720
This is ridiculous,
how much have you told him?

39:23.720 --> 39:25.000
Everything.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.920
I had to, I was abreacting.

39:26.920 --> 39:28.240
You were what?

39:28.240 --> 39:30.560
Releasing tension
through verbalising.

39:30.560 --> 39:31.880
What a load of...

39:31.880 --> 39:34.920
Ah-ah. Don't say anything,
just answer my questions.

39:34.920 --> 39:38.920
Aren't all of your colourful shirts
and ties and surfboards

39:39.680 --> 39:41.920
all part of an elaborate
defence mechanism?

39:41.920 --> 39:44.640
Why repress so much,
why not give more?

39:44.640 --> 39:45.720
I give plenty.

39:45.720 --> 39:47.040
Ah, yes.

39:47.040 --> 39:50.840
I understand that when you gave
blood recently, you passed out.

39:50.840 --> 39:53.360
This is ridiculous,
I feel like I'm exposing myself.

39:53.360 --> 39:56.080
Ah. Once was enough.

39:56.080 --> 39:59.520
I don't blame you for
your confusion. It's in the genes.

39:59.520 --> 40:01.560
Well, then background
does play a role.

40:01.560 --> 40:02.600
Of course.

40:02.600 --> 40:05.360
You're from a main line family,
you're upper-class,

40:05.360 --> 40:07.120
you're respectable. He's a...

40:07.120 --> 40:09.000
I'm from California.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
I rest my case.

40:13.760 --> 40:17.320
Do you love him
in spite of everything?

40:17.320 --> 40:18.560
A lot.

40:18.560 --> 40:19.280
And you?

40:19.280 --> 40:23.280
And you?

40:23.400 --> 40:26.240
(LAUGHS) I'm up for it if you are.

40:26.240 --> 40:28.640
Me too.

40:28.640 --> 40:30.320
Up for what?

40:30.320 --> 40:32.680
He's proposing marriage to you.

40:32.680 --> 40:33.800
I accept.

40:33.800 --> 40:34.360
And so do I.

40:34.360 --> 40:35.400
And so do I.

40:35.400 --> 40:39.400
You're lucky I don't charge
for matchmaking.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.560
(GIGGLES)

40:43.560 --> 40:47.560
# Matchmaker, matchmaker
Make me a match

40:47.600 --> 40:51.600
# Da-da-da-da... #

40:55.600 --> 40:58.040
It was only supposed to be a game.

40:58.040 --> 41:02.040
I wanted to see how many presidents'
names I could find.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.680
There was nothing to do yesterday.

41:04.680 --> 41:07.160
And my school had a snow day.

41:07.160 --> 41:09.560
And my mom wouldn't let me
go outside.

41:09.560 --> 41:11.640
Margie...

41:11.640 --> 41:15.640
the names in our computer
aren't just words on a screen.

41:15.640 --> 41:19.360
Each one of them represents
a real, living person,

41:19.360 --> 41:22.320
people who depend on us
to make them well.

41:22.320 --> 41:26.320
In order to do that, we have to keep
complete and accurate records.

41:27.120 --> 41:29.480
I got scared.

41:29.480 --> 41:31.760
So I tried to put the names back.

41:31.760 --> 41:35.520
But I got confused.

41:35.520 --> 41:38.560
Margie, I called your parents.
They're on their way over here.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.520
And when I get a chance
to talk to them,

41:40.520 --> 41:43.400
then we'll see what has to be done.

41:43.400 --> 41:47.400
Did someone really die?

41:48.640 --> 41:52.520
(SOBS) Oh, no, I'm sorry!

41:52.520 --> 41:56.520
(SOBS) I'm sorry.

42:05.640 --> 42:07.960
You took your feet out, Dr Craig.

42:07.960 --> 42:09.720
Where did you put my socks?

42:09.720 --> 42:11.440
25 more minutes.

42:11.440 --> 42:15.000
I don't need a nurse.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.360
Dr Craig, this is more
than a medical question.

42:18.360 --> 42:21.560
It is omniscient linking.

42:21.560 --> 42:25.200
Yesterday I gave you
the kiss of life.

42:25.200 --> 42:27.360
Wasn't rubbing my toes enough?

42:27.360 --> 42:30.080
I speak metaphorically, of course.

42:30.080 --> 42:33.560
Have you considered that my taking
refuge in that low-down dive

42:33.560 --> 42:36.240
was no accident?
That it was pre-ordained?

42:36.240 --> 42:40.240
That it was fate
that brought you there?

42:40.240 --> 42:43.800
I'm an Episcopalian, Kochar,
I don't have time for the occult.

42:43.800 --> 42:47.360
(SIGHS) Very well.

42:47.360 --> 42:49.160
I'm going down to the cafeteria.
May I...

42:49.160 --> 42:53.160
No. Just go.

42:57.760 --> 43:01.760
Kochar.

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
Yes, Dr Craig?

43:06.240 --> 43:07.600
All right, all right.

43:07.600 --> 43:11.600
Get me a roast beef on white,
hold the mayo.

43:12.520 --> 43:14.000
Stat.

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
Yes, sir.

43:30.280 --> 43:33.320
This is everything
out of the bedroom.

43:33.320 --> 43:37.320
The day Nina died we were in the
middle of...

43:40.000 --> 43:42.920
I said a lot of stupid things.

43:42.920 --> 43:45.080
But not goodbye.

43:45.080 --> 43:48.320
I mean, really say goodbye.

43:48.320 --> 43:50.640
Or thank you...

43:50.640 --> 43:54.040
for coming to Mexico and holding
my hand during med school.

43:54.040 --> 43:56.240
She never complained.

43:56.240 --> 43:59.000
And she hated it there.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.680
If I had been a little bit smarter,

44:00.680 --> 44:03.040
I could've gotten into school
here in the States.

44:03.040 --> 44:05.680
Jack, you ended up with
a residency at St Eligius.

44:05.680 --> 44:06.760
That's not so bad.

44:06.760 --> 44:08.120
Ah, it was a fluke.

44:08.120 --> 44:10.600
What makes you say that?

44:10.600 --> 44:14.600
Because I'm constantly running off
to Auschlander or Westphall.

44:15.120 --> 44:17.200
I can't seem to make a diagnosis
on my own.

44:17.200 --> 44:21.080
You care more about people
than anyone else in the hospital.

44:21.080 --> 44:25.080
Compassion counts as much
as anything else.

44:29.840 --> 44:33.200
I think there's more stuff
in the hall closet.

44:33.200 --> 44:37.200
I'll get them.

44:39.960 --> 44:43.960
What's this?

44:45.200 --> 44:46.360
Hey.

44:46.360 --> 44:48.040
Look what I found.

44:48.040 --> 44:50.600
It was stuck way back on the shelf.

44:50.600 --> 44:54.600
Now when did she get this?

44:55.200 --> 44:59.200
This is everything.

45:01.480 --> 45:04.400
I don't think I could've
done this by myself.

45:04.400 --> 45:05.640
I'm glad I could help out.

45:05.640 --> 45:09.640
Well, thank you.

45:10.760 --> 45:12.120
Guess I'll see you tomorrow.

45:12.120 --> 45:13.200
All right.

45:13.200 --> 45:14.240
Goodbye.

45:14.240 --> 45:16.200
Bye.

45:16.200 --> 45:20.200
Thank you again.

46:17.600 --> 46:21.600
(LAUGHS)
