WEBVTT

00:01.355 --> 00:02.564
Previously on The O.C.:

00:02.648 --> 00:06.109
Wow, so that's Carter Buckley?
I thought he'd look more like Jerry Garcia.

00:06.360 --> 00:10.322
You and me and Summer working on a comic book together, it's probably not the best idea in the first place.

00:10.447 --> 00:12.157
Little brother. Good to see you, man.

00:12.366 --> 00:15.285
- Trey's going to be staying with us.
- Just until I can find my own place.

00:15.410 --> 00:20.040
- You're Ry's girlfriend.
- Oh, well, no, well, not anymore.
- Yeah, we're just friends.

00:22.084 --> 00:23.418
Friends.

00:30.458 --> 00:32.585
What are you making?
Mom's hangover special?

00:32.710 --> 00:35.087
What do you mean, a pack of smokes and fresh cocktail?

00:36.714 --> 00:39.550
Nope. Just, something picked up in prison.

00:40.009 --> 00:42.553
Ah, yeah, the old scallion and shiv omelet.

00:42.720 --> 00:45.514
I've seen Lockup, Stallone's finest work since Over the Top.

00:45.765 --> 00:48.809
Stallone? Nah, I'm more of a Van Damme fan.

00:48.934 --> 00:52.146
- Are you kidding me? Seagal, man.
- Yeah, a divided house cannot eat.

00:52.313 --> 00:55.107
Now, we all gotta get together behind a single action hero.

00:55.274 --> 00:57.902
- Steve McQueen.
- Steve Ma-who?

00:58.652 --> 01:03.157
- My own son doesn't know Steve McQueen.
- You know, a lot of people like Great Escape. I gotta go with Bullitt.

01:03.324 --> 01:05.951
He cooks breakfast and a McQueen fan.
I knew I liked you.

01:06.702 --> 01:09.121
- How was surfing?
- Unbelievable.

01:09.330 --> 01:12.625
- You surf?
- He surfs, he sings, he technically fights crime.

01:12.708 --> 01:15.252
- Maybe Sandy Cohen should be
our action hero.
- Just say the word, my son.

01:15.461 --> 01:18.672
- Think you can give me a surf lesson sometime?
- Oh, better you than me.

01:18.798 --> 01:22.176
- He's been trying to get me out there for years
- I have tried, I have tried,

01:22.301 --> 01:24.261
I have failed, I have failed.

01:25.054 --> 01:27.098
Julie Cooper. This can't be good.

01:27.306 --> 01:32.394
- Julie is Marissa's mom.
- Oh, so, Ryan's mother-in-law.

01:32.853 --> 01:35.147
What, Ryan and Marissa?

01:35.481 --> 01:38.275
- It's on.
- Really?! I am always the last to know

01:38.400 --> 01:41.821
- There is nothing to know.
- Oh, really? 'Cause that's not what it looked like the other night.

01:42.113 --> 01:44.406
You coming to Marissa's rescue and all.

01:44.615 --> 01:46.951
Well, he's very chivalrous, not unlike a young Steve McQueen.

01:47.118 --> 01:51.288
- Yeah, some people say chivalry is dead.
I don't believe it.
- There's nothing going on with me and Marissa.

01:51.622 --> 01:54.250
- Nothing?
- Really?
- Ryan...

01:57.086 --> 02:01.966
- We're taking it slow.
- Takin' it slow. All right!

02:02.466 --> 02:07.221
- Well, it's a good thing she's no longer your neighbor.
- That's right. It's hard to take it slow if they're next door.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.723
So, Caleb and Julie are off on their cruise.

02:10.056 --> 02:11.892
Well, what are we gonna do without them?

02:12.017 --> 02:17.398
Well, for starters, their housekeeper got deported, and so there's no one to stay in the house with Marissa.

02:18.566 --> 02:21.402
So, I told Julie that Marissa could stay here for the week.

02:24.738 --> 02:26.991
That'll keep things at a snail's pace.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:03.861 --> 03:07.573
- I can't believe you're moving in with
the Cohens.
- It's just for the week.

03:08.032 --> 03:11.827
- Besides, this way, I can keep an eye on your boyfriend
- And yours.

03:11.994 --> 03:14.622
- What? I'm not dating Seth.
- Coop, we know who I mean.

03:14.747 --> 03:16.749
No, I don't, 'cause I don't have a boyfriend

03:17.082 --> 03:20.711
Oh, right. Yeah, you and Ryan staying under the same tent drove Alex out of town.

03:21.003 --> 03:23.839
Can't imagine what's gonna happen with you two under the same roof.

03:24.173 --> 03:27.927
- Nothing will happen.
- Yeah, and nothing will happen in this.

03:28.594 --> 03:33.099
- What? It's cute.
- Yeah, well, if you think it's cute wearing something that screams, "Take me now!"

03:33.516 --> 03:36.852
Look, it's the middle of spring.
It's too hot to wear flannel PJs.

03:37.103 --> 03:39.688
What's gonna be too hot is you wearing this,

03:39.897 --> 03:43.609
- and Ryan seeing you wearing this.
- He's not gonna see me wearing it.

03:45.194 --> 03:46.904
But just in case.

03:47.154 --> 03:49.156
I know.

03:50.157 --> 03:53.536
Don't worry. I'll handle it.
I'll find a replacement. Okay, thanks.

03:57.873 --> 04:00.584
Oh, hey, honey. What are you doing?

04:00.835 --> 04:04.004
I'm heading in to the office; starting work on the low-income housing initiative.

04:04.255 --> 04:07.299
- So you're free, then?
- No. What's up?

04:07.758 --> 04:10.886
Well, you know, the O.C. charity yard sale that I was supposed to chair but can't because I'm working.

04:11.095 --> 04:14.849
- The O.C. has a charity yard sale?
- Well, the donors get to keep half the money, so it's not just for charity.

04:15.015 --> 04:18.144
- I thought all the yards around here were gated.
- It's in a ballroom. Of a country club.

04:18.269 --> 04:22.565
So a charity event where the donors keep half the profits and a yard sale with no yard.

04:22.731 --> 04:25.484
- So that's how they do it in the O.C.
- Sandy...

04:28.028 --> 04:30.364
I was just wondering if you could do me a...

04:30.948 --> 04:33.242
tiny... little... favor.

04:35.119 --> 04:37.204
No. No way.

04:38.706 --> 04:41.709
Sandy, it's an honorary chair, a figurehead position.

04:41.834 --> 04:45.337
You'd be the master of ceremonies, like an auctioneer, and you know what an MC has...

04:45.504 --> 04:48.382
An unfair advantage, you know the opponent's weakness.

04:48.507 --> 04:52.052
That's right. A microphone, onstage,
with an audience,

04:52.136 --> 04:54.346
a captive audience.

04:54.472 --> 04:57.433
- And a few show tunes, perhaps?
- No...

04:58.601 --> 05:02.021
- you just have to go by the club today and say hello.
- Just a figurehead.

05:04.857 --> 05:06.525
With a mike.

05:09.612 --> 05:13.032
Hey, men! I'm chairing
the O.C. Psuedo-Charity Non-Yard Sale.

05:13.282 --> 05:16.160
- Gee, Dad, that's fantastic.
- Good luck with that. I need your help.

05:16.494 --> 05:21.081
- What are you doing?
- Well, I never thought I'd be so happy to say this, but Ryan and I have school.

05:21.290 --> 05:23.876
That's your excuse today. Tomorrow, you you're mine. What are you doing today?

05:24.084 --> 05:28.297
- Looking for a job.
- I got one for you: Me, you and the Newpsies.

05:28.714 --> 05:30.591
What's a Newpsie?

05:31.092 --> 05:33.636
They're like vultures, except the Newpsies like to paint their talons.

05:33.719 --> 05:37.098
Actually, they'd rather have somebody else paint their talons.
Oh, here comes a flock right now.

05:37.431 --> 05:41.727
- Sandy Cohen, right on time.
- We just stopped by to say hello and test the mike.

05:41.894 --> 05:45.731
- Oh, and you brought a friend?
- Yes, indeed. Trey, meet Newport's finest.

05:45.856 --> 05:50.486
Trey came along just in case we needed a little help, but I see you don't.
My goodness, you guys are pros.

05:50.653 --> 05:54.365
- We're gonna get out of your hair.
- Actually, it's great that you're here.

05:54.782 --> 05:58.953
The moving company we hired got a flat tire, and now we have no one to do the heavy lifting.

05:59.203 --> 06:02.164
Heavy... lifting... I guess I... could do that

06:02.289 --> 06:04.333
Oh, thank God. Follow me.

06:04.625 --> 06:08.462
I'll be back to pick you up in a
couple of hours.

06:10.047 --> 06:12.133
- I'm glad he could help out.
- Um, Sandy,

06:12.716 --> 06:17.346
the job of the chair is to choose
table linens, flatware, centerpieces...

06:18.973 --> 06:21.267
All right, I'll help Trey with the lifting.

06:22.393 --> 06:26.897
We need you, Sandy. You're the honorary chair. It's not just a figurehead position.

06:28.607 --> 06:30.067
It's not?

06:32.820 --> 06:35.030
Let me just paint a picture of what could maybe happen.

06:35.364 --> 06:37.867
Now, it's late at night and you're thirsty.
So is she.

06:37.992 --> 06:40.744
So you meet up at the fridge.
"Hey."

06:40.995 --> 06:43.539
- ( falsetto ): "Hey."
- "You who?"

06:43.998 --> 06:46.876
( falsetto ): "Maybe just you.
Let's kiss on the mouth, okay?"

06:47.251 --> 06:50.463
-  Oh, let's French hard.
- What are you doing?

06:50.963 --> 06:53.424
Hey, I gotta get going to class.
I'm gonna be late.

06:54.508 --> 06:57.636
Was Seth talking about me, and how awkward it's gonna be when I move in?

06:58.220 --> 07:02.892
- What, you moving in? I had no idea.
- Really? 'Cause my mom said she called Kirsten and ran it by you guys.

07:03.142 --> 07:06.687
- No, but you're moving in, that's great.
- It won't be awkward, right?

07:08.731 --> 07:10.316
Is this awkward?

07:11.525 --> 07:14.445
- No, not at all.
- Great. See you then.

07:22.787 --> 07:24.955
Don't blame me for your sexual tension.

07:25.289 --> 07:28.459
Hey, Cohen. You know what's coming out on DVD this weekend?

07:28.584 --> 07:32.254
Yeah, I sure do, Elektra and there's a reason I didn't see that crap in the theaters.

07:32.421 --> 07:33.839
Come  on.

07:33.964 --> 07:37.218
Ever since the whole comic book debacle,
I kind of promised Summer I'd dial it down a bit.

07:37.593 --> 07:39.428
I'm in the same boat.

07:39.637 --> 07:43.140
My mom is making me donate ten of these for the charity yard sale.

07:43.349 --> 07:44.975
Dude, you're a martyr. It sucks.

07:45.101 --> 07:47.645
- Anyway, I'll see you around.
- Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, Zach.

07:48.104 --> 07:51.899
I got an idea. Why don't I donate five of mine, spare you five of yours.
We'll go in on it together.

07:52.233 --> 07:55.778
- You'd do that?
- Yeah. Look, we really should be putting comic books behind us, anyways.

07:56.028 --> 07:58.364
- And it's for charity.
- That's right. So we'll split the profits, right?

07:58.447 --> 08:00.407
- Absolutely.
- All right. Good stuff.

08:03.494 --> 08:06.831
Easy with that.
That's worth thousands of dollars.

08:07.039 --> 08:10.459
Then why wouldn't they want it?
Seems like a perfectly good stool.

08:10.668 --> 08:15.172
It's an antique ottoman and it's hideous.
Now, on to the bas-relief.

08:15.548 --> 08:19.260
- What's this?
- Oh, David Pastor's father-in-law's brother

08:19.385 --> 08:23.431
ran the prop house at Warner Brothers.
It's from some Tom Cruise movie.

08:26.434 --> 08:29.687
This is the crystal egg from
Risky Business?

08:29.854 --> 08:31.981
Well, it's not the F-14 from Top Gun.

08:35.067 --> 08:37.611
That is so cool.

08:38.611 --> 08:40.280
This thing must be worth a fortune.

08:41.282 --> 08:43.409
See, it's appraised at $10,000.

08:44.493 --> 08:45.953
That's a fortune.

08:47.288 --> 08:50.749
I guess. Come, Trey.

08:51.959 --> 08:53.544
Come.

09:04.180 --> 09:05.890
Welcome to casa de Cohen.

09:06.098 --> 09:08.851
We're almost at capacity, but there's always room for one more.

09:09.018 --> 09:11.937
Well, thanks for letting me stay here.

09:12.188 --> 09:14.940
Well, I couldn't let you stay in a mansion all by yourself.

09:15.065 --> 09:18.027
- So, where do you want me?
- Good question.

09:20.237 --> 09:24.992
- So what are you doing with these things?
- Making a grand sacrifice for charity, Ryan

09:25.201 --> 09:29.121
It's all in a day's work.
When does Marissa get here?

09:29.789 --> 09:33.209
- I don't know.You want another dead-arm?
- No, thank you.

09:33.501 --> 09:36.086
We'll see if Trey's back I wonder how it went.

09:36.337 --> 09:38.631
Well, I didn't hear about Newpsie knifings on the news, so...

09:38.756 --> 09:41.801
- Hey, you want to go a little living room rematch?
- Yeah, yeah. Let's make it a three-way.

09:43.844 --> 09:47.640
What?! Came out weird.
I'll meet you downstairs.

09:56.315 --> 09:57.942
Hi.

09:59.693 --> 10:02.113
- You're not Trey.
- Kirsten moved him.

10:02.530 --> 10:04.907
- I'm going to go find him, then.
- Okay.

10:05.282 --> 10:10.246
Right. Sorry. You know, if anyone should know about knocking before entering the poolhouse, that'd be me.

10:11.247 --> 10:13.165
Nothing you haven't seen before, right?

10:14.458 --> 10:15.835
Right.

10:22.258 --> 10:25.553
That didn't take long.
Come on, Trey's inside, wearing a shirt.

11:33.898 --> 11:35.733
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:38.653 --> 11:41.072
- Couldn't sleep.
- Me either.

11:41.364 --> 11:44.283
- Hungry?
- Sure.

11:56.504 --> 11:59.590
Nice PJ's. Aren't you hot?

12:00.716 --> 12:03.010
I get cold.

12:07.765 --> 12:10.726
- How's the pool house?
- Weird.

12:11.352 --> 12:14.647
You know, the only time I've ever slept in that bed I was with you.

12:22.029 --> 12:23.489
Whoa.

12:25.241 --> 12:27.827
You guys are up early.

12:29.537 --> 12:31.872
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.

12:32.540 --> 12:34.000
- No, it's cool.
- No, it's fine.

12:34.834 --> 12:39.463
Just got to get a jump on the day.
Apartment hunting.

12:40.548 --> 12:44.885
- Hey, you know, I know a place that's available. It was my friend Alex's.
- Want to check it out, man?

12:45.970 --> 12:48.598
Not now, I can't. I got to help Sandy with the yard sale.

12:49.098 --> 12:52.435
Don't mess with those Newpsies.
But, hey, I did my time yesterday.

12:52.643 --> 12:55.146
Well, I'm free. I could go with you.

12:58.065 --> 12:59.900
- There you go.
- Thanks.

13:05.281 --> 13:07.742
All right, just so you know, it's cool;
you don't have to find a place.

13:08.701 --> 13:10.786
Love you like a brother, brother,

13:10.995 --> 13:13.456
but we're too old to be sleeping in the same room.

13:14.665 --> 13:17.293
Besides... I think I'm getting in the way.

13:26.302 --> 13:28.512
All right, buddy, it's catch-up time.

13:28.679 --> 13:32.475
Since the pool house has been occupied, there hasn't really been any privacy,
so this'll have to do.

13:32.725 --> 13:35.227
There been any, midnight run-ins involving,

13:35.311 --> 13:39.231
- say, Yoo-hoo and under-thingies?
- There's nothing going on, Seth.

13:39.774 --> 13:41.567
Okay, you be that way.

13:41.692 --> 13:44.820
All right, ottoman, work with me.
You're sexy, get nasty.

13:44.946 --> 13:48.032
Work with me, you ottoman, you little...
That's it, you're a cougar.

13:48.157 --> 13:50.159
You're a panther and you're in the woods.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.669
- Seth!
- What? What? Oh...

14:02.004 --> 14:04.590
Hey, good save. Thing's probably worth a million dollars.

14:04.840 --> 14:07.009
$10,000.

14:07.343 --> 14:09.387
- Says it's from Risky Business.
- Really?

14:09.679 --> 14:12.265
Hey, dude, turn it the other way.
It's got a crack in it.

14:14.517 --> 14:15.893
Hello.

14:16.060 --> 14:18.020
Whoa, ow, ladies.

14:18.187 --> 14:21.524
I hate to say I told you so, but these centerpieces and those tablecloths,

14:21.732 --> 14:24.860
they clash. Taryn, I told you,
get those linens with the hem stitch.

14:25.152 --> 14:29.782
-  I know, Sandy, I know.
- I'm sorry, but...
you have no one else to blame but yourself.

14:30.616 --> 14:32.952
Who are you, and what did you do
with my husband?

14:33.619 --> 14:37.248
- Well, if it isn't our proud sponsor.
- I brought the banner and Carter.

14:37.331 --> 14:39.834
- Carter.
- Sandy, I had no idea you were so multifaceted.

14:41.294 --> 14:45.548
Joan. Tell me you didn't order those
napkin rings.

14:45.840 --> 14:49.051
- This is not a mob wedding.
- Gosh, Sandy, I thought they were kind of fun

14:49.260 --> 14:51.554
- No.
- Who wants to help me hang the banner?

14:51.637 --> 14:55.099
Ask Taryn, please. She screwed up the tablecloths. Get her off the tablecloths.

14:55.308 --> 14:56.142
Okay.

14:57.184 --> 14:59.645
- Thirsty?
- Yes.

15:01.856 --> 15:05.901
So,  you and Kirsten have been spending a lot of time working together.

15:07.236 --> 15:09.530
Long hours, late nights.

15:10.406 --> 15:13.409
Sandy, you have a great wife.
Sorry to keep her from you.

15:15.161 --> 15:17.538
And from everything she says,
we should be friends.

15:18.122 --> 15:21.000
Well, here's to being friends. You, me...
and Kirsten.

15:28.966 --> 15:31.135
So this chick just split?

15:31.385 --> 15:33.304
Moved back to her parents', yeah.

15:33.429 --> 15:36.390
And didn't get her damage deposit back, either.

15:37.016 --> 15:38.643
So, we got a decision?

15:38.851 --> 15:43.064
I got a tenant in 6A whose pipes burst.
I got to get down there before they drown.

15:45.900 --> 15:50.655
- I'll take it.
- Great. I'll need first and last month's rent, plus security.

15:51.530 --> 15:56.661
- That's $3,000... I...
- Hey, you know, what if we make you a better offer?

15:57.119 --> 15:59.622
I mean, you know those busted pipes?
Trey here's quite handy.

15:59.872 --> 16:01.874
Him with a sledgehammer, amazing.

16:02.124 --> 16:05.044
I think she means hammer, but... but, yeah.

16:05.336 --> 16:09.465
What if I, uh, became your guy?
Anything breaks down, I'll fix it.

16:10.841 --> 16:13.678
I'll call you tonight with an answer.
Just leave you number.

16:21.185 --> 16:25.064
Cohen. I hear you're the guy to see about the inventory.

16:25.273 --> 16:27.650
Hey, will you help me? I've got to take pictures of all of this crap.

16:27.817 --> 16:29.485
- Yeah.
- Okay, thanks. Hold it up.

16:30.361 --> 16:33.489
More. More, more. You're naughty.

16:33.572 --> 16:35.908
- Just take the picture.
- You're an animal in the woods.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.202
Excuse me, you're Seth?

16:38.619 --> 16:42.039
- Carter Buckley. I'm working with...
- Oh, yeah, my mom.

16:42.164 --> 16:46.419
Your mom, Newport Living.
She said you were quite the comics fan.

16:46.711 --> 16:50.423
Oh, was, was. Zach and I here are actually moving on.

16:50.798 --> 16:53.968
- Yeah, we're auctioning off our comics.
- Your mom said you had your own comic.

16:54.260 --> 16:57.638
Oh, we did. We almost sold it to Wildstorm,

16:57.847 --> 17:01.892
- save for a meltdown during the pitch.
- Yeah, but we're putting that behind us now

17:02.059 --> 17:04.520
Must be hard to walk away from your own comic

17:05.229 --> 17:09.733
You weren't at the meeting.
I don't think Cohen's picked up a pencil since that fateful Valentine's Day.

17:09.858 --> 17:13.112
- Well, you know, I've actually been sort of
-You went on without me?

17:13.279 --> 17:17.366
- How many issues do you have?
- Uh... probably have enough for, like,
12 or 13 stories.

17:17.617 --> 17:19.743
That's, like, the perfect amount for a graphic novel.

17:19.952 --> 17:24.205
Oh, I always wanted to write the great American graphic novel, but we cannot.

17:24.332 --> 17:28.127
- Yes, we can. Come on. This is awesome.
- I know, but it's not even up to me.

17:28.336 --> 17:30.588
- You know who it's up to?
- Who's it up to?

17:30.755 --> 17:33.466
Start with an "S."

17:34.592 --> 17:37.053
Hello, Summer, my dearest.

17:37.219 --> 17:39.347
Okay, what do you want, Cohen?

17:39.513 --> 17:43.392
- I thought you were working at the yard sale
- Can't a guy just show his lady a little bit of love?

17:43.643 --> 17:46.771
Okay, I was at the yard sale...

17:47.188 --> 17:51.943
- and Zach and I got to talking.
- Zach was there? Glad to hear that you two are putting the past behind you.

17:52.276 --> 17:54.362
Well, about the past.

17:54.570 --> 17:57.990
So Zach and I got to talking,
and we're sort of chatting about,

17:58.908 --> 18:02.578
- our passions and our dreams and...
- Aw, that make you think of me?

18:02.828 --> 18:04.872
That is so sweet.

18:06.374 --> 18:08.501
- No, actually.
- Really?

18:08.668 --> 18:11.087
Because the only other passions you have besides me are

18:11.337 --> 18:13.214
Captain Oats, whiny music

18:13.673 --> 18:15.800
and, well, I know it can't be comic books, because

18:16.008 --> 18:19.220
if you bring up you and Zach and Atomic County. I'll kill you both while you sleep.

18:22.431 --> 18:25.851
I hope you approve of the tablecloth that
I have selected for dinner.

18:26.352 --> 18:30.147
I really don't care about tablecloths, honey. I just enjoy watching those Newpsies squirm.

18:30.773 --> 18:32.817
Have I mentioned how much I like Carter?

18:33.359 --> 18:35.361
A few times, yes.

18:35.778 --> 18:38.948
After Jimmy left, I thought I'd said good-bye to my last friend, but Carter...

18:40.032 --> 18:43.703
- I think he's a keeper.
- Really? Well, that's great.

18:44.036 --> 18:48.499
- We're talking about hanging out next week, maybe get some drinks.
- Well, I know he likes drinks.

18:54.088 --> 18:56.507
You are looking at a proud new renter.

18:57.842 --> 19:00.678
- Wow, congrats, man.
- Thanks. Thanks.

19:02.221 --> 19:06.517
- I'll get it.
- Oh, thank you.
- We are playing...

19:08.978 --> 19:10.813
Cohen residence.

19:10.938 --> 19:13.024
Oh, hi. Yeah, hang on.

19:13.899 --> 19:17.695
- Trey, it's for you. It's the landlord.
- You can grab it right there.

19:26.078 --> 19:30.041
- Hello.
- Hey, so... bad news.

19:31.125 --> 19:35.296
*Your background didn't check out. I just can't risk making you the manager.*

19:37.340 --> 19:40.968
But you seem like a good guy, so I'll hold the place for 24 hours.

19:43.804 --> 19:46.015
I'll come up with the money.

19:46.349 --> 19:48.392
- Thanks.
- You bet.

20:00.196 --> 20:02.990
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, just wanted to know when
I'm moving in.

20:03.616 --> 20:06.327
- You sure you can cover it, the money?
- It's handled, little brother.

20:06.494 --> 20:09.622
I'm just going to do some work around the place until I can pay him back.

20:09.830 --> 20:11.958
Told you, I'm getting it together.

20:12.625 --> 20:16.170
- I'm proud of you, man.
- Well, thank Marissa. It was her idea.

20:53.291 --> 20:55.543
Where you been?

20:59.130 --> 21:00.965
Don't worry about me, Mommy.

21:06.512 --> 21:10.099
I was over at the new place. Landlord wanted me to tape down some drywall.

21:10.391 --> 21:12.560
- Do a little plastering.
- At 6:00 in the morning?

21:12.852 --> 21:15.563
Plaster's got to dry before you paint, bro.

21:20.735 --> 21:21.694
Okay.

21:37.418 --> 21:38.628
Come in!

21:38.961 --> 21:41.005
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:41.631 --> 21:45.468
I was making breakfast and... I made too much. Thought you might be hungry.

21:46.052 --> 21:48.846
- Oh... No thanks.
- Yeah?

21:53.184 --> 21:56.103
Hey, I just wanted to thank you again for helping me out.

21:56.562 --> 21:58.147
With the apartment.

22:00.858 --> 22:02.985
But you're probably busy, so...

22:03.235 --> 22:06.072
- I'll come back later.
- Look. I overheard your call.

22:07.657 --> 22:09.784
I know he didn't take the offer.

22:11.452 --> 22:14.372
- So when you going to tell Ryan?
- I'm not.

22:15.581 --> 22:18.626
- You know, he really wants to believe in you.
- And why shouldn't he?

22:18.918 --> 22:21.462
- Because you lied to him.
- It's not a lie.

22:21.879 --> 22:25.132
I got friends. I'm going to come up with the money.

22:27.843 --> 22:29.762
I can help you.

22:32.473 --> 22:37.311
You've done enough. And I don't need anyone else here worrying about me.
I've got it.

22:39.981 --> 22:41.565
All right.

22:41.732 --> 22:45.278
But you should know, if you do anything stupid, it's really going to hurt Ryan.

22:49.115 --> 22:51.701
- So what do you got?
- Our new hobby.

22:51.867 --> 22:53.703
- Baseball cards.
- They're really cool.

22:53.869 --> 22:56.831
They  come with gum, and they're worth...
like all sorts of different amounts.

22:56.998 --> 23:00.835
But, each month, they go up and down in value, like the stock market.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.880
- And they come with gum.
- You talked to Summer, didn't you?

23:05.006 --> 23:08.426
I dipped a toe in the comic book pool.
It was icy, Zach; it was subzero.

23:08.593 --> 23:11.971
So that's it? All that work, you're never going to show anyone else...

23:12.263 --> 23:15.266
- because of a girl?
- She threatened to kill us both.

23:15.683 --> 23:17.476
While we sleep.

23:20.021 --> 23:21.772
Give me one of those pieces of gum.

23:23.566 --> 23:26.485
- Who's Kurt Schilling, anyway?
- I don't know.

23:27.028 --> 23:30.323
Dude, I like his uniform, though.
Can I have this one?

23:34.844 --> 23:38.931
Hey. My mom already left for
the Pseudo-Charity Non...

23:39.182 --> 23:41.517
- Yard Sale.
- Actually, I came to see you guys.

23:41.976 --> 23:46.731
My old assistant is the VP of development at a graphic novel company.
I arranged a meeting.

23:49.942 --> 23:54.405
No. I'm sorry. Now let's go. Zach, you're dri
Thank you so much, though.

23:56.616 --> 24:00.953
- Seth, do you realize what he's saying?
- Yes, he's offering to kill my relationship with Summer.

24:01.245 --> 24:05.291
- He's offering us a second chance.
- I promised.

24:05.458 --> 24:08.002
Dude, technically, you're not doing anything wrong.

24:08.169 --> 24:12.298
You said you only floated the comic book by her, not a graphic novel.

24:15.927 --> 24:18.763
They have nicer paper. So, technically...

24:21.224 --> 24:23.309
- Coop!
- I'm in the basement!

24:26.020 --> 24:28.731
No torture chamber down here.
Lost that bet.

24:29.607 --> 24:33.528
- So, what are we looking for, anyway?
- It's for the auction. I need...

24:33.945 --> 24:36.948
I need money for Trey's security deposit.

24:37.365 --> 24:39.992
Interesting stuff, huh?

24:45.790 --> 24:48.960
Yeah, see that mark right there?
That leopard's head, with a "W.E."?

24:49.127 --> 24:54.215
Wow, it means made in London
by William Eaton, circa... 1876, I think.

24:54.882 --> 24:58.678
- Could be worth a couple grand.
- All that Antique Roadshow really paid off

25:05.309 --> 25:07.103
All right. Come on.

25:08.980 --> 25:11.983
All right. I've become quite the expert, since I've got to put one on every week.

25:12.066 --> 25:14.777
- It's okay, man. I don't need your help.
- Yeah, you do.

25:17.071 --> 25:20.616
You're going to hang yourself with this thing. Let's see...

25:24.287 --> 25:28.708
You know, these formal things, they...
seem like they're going to be pretty boring,
but...

25:30.710 --> 25:34.005
usually something crazy happens.
Keeps it exciting.

25:34.130 --> 25:37.258
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. All right. There you go.

25:38.217 --> 25:40.470
I am impressed.

25:45.767 --> 25:47.393
Nice.

25:49.562 --> 25:52.356
Ready to rip off some Newpsies?

25:54.275 --> 25:56.277
- Kirsten?
- Hello, Chanda.

25:56.360 --> 25:59.113
- We never see you anymore.
- I know. I've been really busy with work.

26:02.825 --> 26:07.580
- Marissa, where'd you get that?
- I found this in the basement with all
this other old junk my mom's getting rid of

26:07.705 --> 26:10.750
- I better get in there.
- You look beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

26:13.211 --> 26:15.379
- When you think about it,
- our own graphic novel

26:15.505 --> 26:18.674
it's like ten times cooler than a comic book ever was.

26:18.966 --> 26:23.012
- You guys bringing back the comic book?
- No. Absolutely not.
- Goodness gracious, no.

26:23.304 --> 26:25.223
It's a graphic novel; it's totally different.

26:26.349 --> 26:30.061
So there's no Kid Chino or no Cosmo Girl?
No the two of you working together,
ruining our friendships?

26:30.269 --> 26:32.188
I guess it isn't that different.

26:32.438 --> 26:36.275
- Look, I promise it won't be like before.
- And we already kind of said yes.

26:36.484 --> 26:38.694
- Yeah, but just to a meeting.
- Okay...

26:39.737 --> 26:42.865
Any trouble... no more graphic novel,

26:43.157 --> 26:45.326
no more comics, no more me.

26:47.328 --> 26:49.288
- Pinkie swear.
- Okay.

26:53.209 --> 26:57.463
- Hey, last minute addition?
- Oh, yeah. Thanks. I'll just take it in the back and tag it.

26:58.798 --> 27:02.176
Thanks again for helping out my brother.
I appreciate it.

27:03.052 --> 27:05.054
Seems like things are going pretty good, right?

27:05.888 --> 27:09.892
Yeah. Well, I'm going to go see if they need help inside. I'll see you in there.

27:46.345 --> 27:48.139
Trey.

27:53.269 --> 27:55.146
I'll see you in a bit.
What's up?

27:55.313 --> 27:59.442
There's this glass egg from Risky Business. It's probably the most valuable thing here, and now it's gone.

28:02.111 --> 28:04.155
- Trey didn't...?
- Yeah. Yeah. I think he did.

28:06.365 --> 28:09.368
Why would Trey steal anything...
everything's going great, right?

28:11.704 --> 28:15.583
No. No, he lied. He didn't clear the background check on the apartment.

28:18.795 --> 28:21.881
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because I told her not to.

28:25.343 --> 28:28.679
- So you stole it.
- I didn't steal it.
- Don't lie to me, Trey.

28:32.350 --> 28:36.270
What does it matter?
These people think this stuff is junk.

28:36.354 --> 28:40.983
How could you do this, man?
After everything the Cohens have done
for you, everything Marissa's done for you?

28:41.734 --> 28:45.071
- Can't you think of anyone but yourself for five minutes?
- I wasn't thinking about myself.

28:45.154 --> 28:48.950
I was thinking about you.
That's why I wanted to get the money,
so I could just get out of everybody's way.

28:49.075 --> 28:53.663
- Well, now you're going to be, 'cause you're going back to jail.
- Wait. Stop.

28:55.373 --> 28:58.000
I could still get it back.

29:00.336 --> 29:03.005
I've got the money.

29:08.261 --> 29:09.804
Come on. Please.

29:13.182 --> 29:15.518
You've done enough. I'll go.

29:17.728 --> 29:22.859
Good afternoon, Newport Beach, and
welcome to the O.C. Pseudo-Charity
Non-Yard Sale.

29:24.610 --> 29:25.903
Yes, exactly. You get it.

29:26.195 --> 29:29.407
I'm Sandy Cohen. I'll be your host and your auctioneer for this grand event,

29:29.699 --> 29:31.742
brought to you by Newport Living

29:31.909 --> 29:36.664
and the fabulous team of Carter Buckley and the lovely and alluring Kirsten Cohen.

29:36.998 --> 29:39.250
Let's give it up for them!

29:40.626 --> 29:44.297
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to go find the egg before anyone notices it's gone.

29:47.633 --> 29:54.557
Last year, we raised $100,000.....
only 50,000 which actually went to charity.

29:56.642 --> 29:59.562
- Psst. Summer. Come on.
- What? But the auction.

30:03.858 --> 30:06.527
- we're stalling until Ryan gets back with egg, okay?
- What egg?

30:06.694 --> 30:08.946
Our first item...

30:09.655 --> 30:11.157
- Hey.
- Hi.

30:11.532 --> 30:14.410
- Can I help you?
- Oh, well... we're your assistants.

30:14.786 --> 30:18.372
Every honorary chair gets assistants...
to assist.

30:21.918 --> 30:25.046
Let's welcome our lovely assistants,
ladies and gentlemen.

30:32.553 --> 30:35.181
- Hey. Where are you going?
- I'll tell you later.

30:35.306 --> 30:38.142
- Tell me now. Marissa gets to be part of the plan.
- There's no plan. I just got to do something.

30:38.267 --> 30:41.145
Ok, well, you're going to need a wingman,
and Marissa and my dad are busy.

30:41.395 --> 30:43.606
- Come on. I never get to go.
- Yeah, there's a reason.

30:43.815 --> 30:46.901
Yeah, but if I go with you, no one's going to suspect anything, 'cause we all know

30:47.068 --> 30:50.363
that if you were doing anything dangerous,
I wouldn't get to go. I'm the perfect cover.

30:51.030 --> 30:53.699
- No more comments about me and Marissa?
- You and who?

30:55.743 --> 30:58.412
I didn't know you were going to throw it.
I'll catch it next time.
I just need a heads up.

30:58.830 --> 31:02.041
- You going to be wingman, you're going to have to catch the keys.
- I'll catch the keys next time.

31:02.250 --> 31:05.503
Okay, folks, here's a beautiful Erte-esque statue.

31:05.711 --> 31:08.172
Yes, indeed, very fetching.
Why don't we start the bidding at...

31:08.589 --> 31:11.717
$75. I guess it's very "esque."
More "esque" than Erte.

31:13.719 --> 31:15.930
Sold to the lovely young lady.

31:16.389 --> 31:20.393
The ram's head is going for... $300.
Do we hear $300?

31:20.643 --> 31:22.728
$300 over here!
$400 over here!

31:22.854 --> 31:25.606
$550! Over here! Going once! Going twice!

31:25.940 --> 31:30.319
Sold for $550. Imagine what the whole beast would've cost you.

31:47.295 --> 31:49.255
Do I hear $2,000 for the tea set?

31:49.380 --> 31:53.468
$2,000! Do I hear $2,500?
$2,500! Well, okay. $3,000?

31:53.593 --> 31:56.429
$3,000!
$3,000! $3,500?

31:56.637 --> 31:59.682
$3,500! Do I hear $4,000?

31:59.807 --> 32:01.976
- Come on, folks, reach into those deep pockets.
- $5,000.

32:02.185 --> 32:04.645
- Fi... Five thousand dollars!
- $5,000.

32:05.521 --> 32:10.026
Do I hear $5,500? $5,500, anyone?
$5,500. All right.

32:10.485 --> 32:13.905
Going once. Going twice. Sold!

32:14.572 --> 32:18.493
For $5,000 to my lovely bride, who,
apparently, is just crazy for tea.

32:23.915 --> 32:26.959
- All right, this is it. Must be in the back. You stay here.
- What are you gonna do?

32:28.503 --> 32:30.463
- I don't know.
- Okay, I got a plan

32:30.671 --> 32:34.050
it's the kind of plan that made me All-Camp Capture the Flag, Camp Taco, and it is extremely stealth.

32:35.218 --> 32:40.515
This next one is a very exciting one.
Folks, who here... is a Tom Cruise fan?

32:41.057 --> 32:42.683
- Do something.
- What? Why?

32:42.850 --> 32:45.478
- This is what Trey stole; Ryan went to go get it back.
- What do you want me to do about it?

32:45.728 --> 32:50.149
Ladies, if you could, please bring,
straight out of 1983...

32:50.483 --> 32:54.821
My shoes! Yeah! Which are vintage!

32:55.571 --> 32:58.658
- Your shoes?
- How about we auction these off?

32:58.825 --> 33:03.079
- What are you doing?
- Everything's been auctioned off.
- Other than... you know.

33:03.412 --> 33:08.417
Yeah, I do know, and it's up next. So you
better think of something else to auction,
or Summer's gonna be selling herself.

33:09.252 --> 33:12.505
- $30! $30 anyone?
- Sixty!

33:14.465 --> 33:16.926
- Sixty dollars?
- Ew! Foot fetish much?
- Sold!

33:24.308 --> 33:26.978
- Hello. Pleased to meet you.
- Who the hell are you?

33:27.228 --> 33:30.398
Well, I am Pippens McGee, and I'm from the Film Preservation Society.

33:30.606 --> 33:34.485
Now, what we are doing is, we're putting on a Tom Cruise retrospective.

33:34.694 --> 33:38.948
Now, I understand that you are in possession of the crystal egg from
Risky Business?

33:40.700 --> 33:43.411
Hi. How are you? Now, what we're doing is,

33:43.619 --> 33:48.082
we're collecting Mr. Cruise's props from his most memorable films and putting them on display.

33:48.291 --> 33:52.295
We've got the rum bottle from Cocktail.
We've got the ceramic mask from
Vanilla Sky

33:52.420 --> 33:54.464
We've got the little kid with the big head from Jerry Maguire.

33:54.589 --> 33:58.593
- He's actually in the car. I don't know if you're interested in meeting him...
- Come on, man, get lost.

33:59.093 --> 34:02.555
- Wait. How does he know about the egg?
- How does he know about the egg?

34:02.847 --> 34:05.224
How do you know? How do I know?
How does he know? How do you?
How do I?

34:05.433 --> 34:07.518
- How do you know about the egg?
- How do I know about the egg?
- Yes.

34:07.685 --> 34:10.396
Okay, but... Mr. Cruise had it outfitted
with a...

34:10.688 --> 34:14.775
trans... mitro... pneumonic
transmitter device tronic.

34:15.359 --> 34:19.864
It's... sort of a homing device.
Must be a Scientology thing. Mr. Cruise
does it to all his favorite props.

34:20.197 --> 34:23.242
- Let's kill this guy, man.
- Hey! Hi.

34:23.409 --> 34:25.703
What the hell is going on?

34:32.960 --> 34:35.797
- Seth! Go deep!
- This never worked in P.E.

34:44.054 --> 34:45.889
All right...

34:46.431 --> 34:51.020
This is unexpected. But in a good way.
We have a new addition to the auction.

34:51.478 --> 34:55.233
They clean, they mow the lawn,
they look good in suits.

34:55.775 --> 34:59.821
Folks, we're talking about two of Newport's most strapping young men, Zach and Trey!

35:00.279 --> 35:02.990
- Where do we begin the bidding?
- Eight hundred!

35:22.009 --> 35:24.804
- Ryan, I caught it.
- That's great. Run!

35:31.477 --> 35:36.441
And now the item you've all been waiting for. Since there is no thing and no one left to be auctioned,

35:37.108 --> 35:43.156
that's right, folks, finally, the crystal egg from Risky Business. Ladies.

35:46.075 --> 35:50.663
- Ladies.
- Yeah. So, you've all heard of a silent auction,

35:51.080 --> 35:53.916
but for this item, we thought it might be fun to do a blind auction.

35:54.083 --> 35:58.004
Yeah, since you can't actually see the egg,
we thought we would describe it to you.

35:58.171 --> 36:01.424
So, it's egg-shaped, and...
it's made of crystal.

36:01.591 --> 36:05.344
And Tom Cruise touched it. So that's hot.

36:07.054 --> 36:10.391
That's hot. Let's start the bidding at $5,000

36:13.436 --> 36:15.855
$10,000! Going once!

36:16.355 --> 36:20.109
Come on, folks, we're talking about a major piece of motion picture history here.

36:25.865 --> 36:27.742
$10,000 going twice!

36:27.950 --> 36:30.995
Reach into those deep pockets of yours!
Come on, folks!

36:31.162 --> 36:33.998
$10,000 going three times!

36:34.624 --> 36:37.085
Going... going...

36:37.794 --> 36:40.755
Yes! Going and sold!

36:41.589 --> 36:43.508
To the beautiful young lady right here at the front.

36:43.716 --> 36:49.680
Gentlemen, please present the egg to the very proud owner. Ladies and gentlemen!

36:50.556 --> 36:53.476
That's it for today's auction.
The bar is open!

37:03.277 --> 37:05.905
Looks like the Ironist and Kid Chino,

37:06.364 --> 37:10.243
with a little help from Cosmo Girl and
Little Miss Vixen, saved the day.

37:10.827 --> 37:15.498
- It's like an issue of Atomic County.
- No, just life with Trey. Thank you for your help.

37:19.085 --> 37:22.630
I don't know what you kids were up to, but
I'm betting it had something to do with Trey

37:23.256 --> 37:25.675
He sings, he surfs, and he reads minds.

37:25.883 --> 37:28.428
And it's still not enough to get you to talk to me.

37:28.970 --> 37:32.140
The next time something comes up,
come to me.

37:47.780 --> 37:50.992
So I earned $400 auctioning myself off.

37:51.451 --> 37:53.411
I figure that's a start, right?

37:56.414 --> 38:00.001
I got you the money you need.
I sold something of my basement.

38:01.836 --> 38:04.130
I said I'd help you.
I just wish you'd heard me.

38:08.217 --> 38:09.844
I screwed up.

38:10.678 --> 38:12.221
I know.

38:13.806 --> 38:15.516
I-I just...

38:17.268 --> 38:19.979
- wanted to do it on my own.
- You don't have to do this on your own.

38:20.104 --> 38:24.984
Yeah, I do. 'Cause there's no way Ryan's ever gonna forgive me, and...

38:25.860 --> 38:28.029
I don't blame him.

38:28.905 --> 38:30.907
I'll talk to him.

38:37.330 --> 38:38.748
Thank you.

38:41.876 --> 38:44.045
And I'm gonna pay you back.

38:59.477 --> 39:02.188
You know, if you told me you wanted that tea set, I would have just given it to you.

39:02.939 --> 39:06.692
Well... my mom would've been proud to have her tea set auctioned for charity.

39:08.861 --> 39:13.324
It's okay. I thought it was lost.
My dad's not a big fan of tea.

39:32.343 --> 39:34.595
What are you gonna say to them?

39:35.054 --> 39:39.016
Nothing. In the morning, he's gone.
I don't care where he goes.

39:40.601 --> 39:44.897
Well, he's going to Alex's old apartment.
I got him the money.

39:45.898 --> 39:47.567
Legally.

39:50.570 --> 39:51.612
Thanks.

40:00.163 --> 40:01.664
You cold?

40:02.498 --> 40:05.293
You know, always. I do wear flannel pajamas.

40:17.430 --> 40:18.890
Thanks.

40:24.645 --> 40:26.606
Sorry. Hang on.

40:28.691 --> 40:30.860
It's my mom. Hey.

40:33.988 --> 40:36.157
Oh. Well, is everything okay?

40:39.285 --> 40:41.496
Okay. All right. Bye.

40:43.998 --> 40:46.667
I guess my mom came home early.

40:47.877 --> 40:50.088
She wants to pick me up in half an hour.

40:54.550 --> 40:55.927
So...

40:57.303 --> 40:58.679
So.

41:04.102 --> 41:06.312
I better go pack my stuff.

41:16.864 --> 41:20.660
