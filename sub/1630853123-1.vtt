02:06.961 --> 02:08.630
<i>Nina.</i>

02:09.881 --> 02:10.924
Nina.

02:17.347 --> 02:19.533
You want me to start moving
the rest of this camera stuff?

02:19.557 --> 02:22.060
No, that's all right, I'll get it.
Thanks.

02:48.294 --> 02:51.464
When you gonna give Marvin
back his ring? Just curious.

02:52.090 --> 02:54.509
Girl, please.
I would if I knew where the hell he was.

02:55.176 --> 02:57.512
Or maybe I'll just
keep it as a reminder...

03:00.348 --> 03:02.267
...never to make the same mistake twice.

03:02.934 --> 03:04.227
Getting engaged?

03:04.978 --> 03:06.896
- No, falling in love.
- Oh, shit.

03:06.980 --> 03:08.958
Because that shit is played out
like an eight-track.

03:08.982 --> 03:11.109
Hello, hello.
Don't leave me hangin', please.

03:11.192 --> 03:14.362
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you. A cynic is born. Hallelujah.

03:14.445 --> 03:16.614
Resurrected from the tomb.

03:16.698 --> 03:18.950
Can we talk, Nappy Head?

03:19.033 --> 03:21.119
I mean, really, really talk, Nappy Head.

03:21.202 --> 03:23.788
I ain't talkin',
talkin' in them tediously taut tones

03:23.872 --> 03:26.124
of tortuously tangled
and toughed-up tongues.

03:26.207 --> 03:30.920
But can you speak to me
in your language of divinity?

03:31.004 --> 03:36.593
With your miracle of ritual
and spiritual drum, can you--

03:44.976 --> 03:47.353
- Am I talking to you?
- No, but I'm in your conversation.

03:47.437 --> 03:49.731
- No, am I taking to you?
- Why is she always like this?

03:49.814 --> 03:53.234
Sheila, what you need
is a man to get in a conversation with.

03:53.318 --> 03:56.154
Excuse me, Ed,
but I have a man, thank you.

03:56.237 --> 03:58.156
- And where is he?
- He's not here.

03:58.239 --> 04:00.283
Well, Sheila, I know what you need girl.

04:00.366 --> 04:03.328
You need some romance in your life.

04:03.411 --> 04:06.122
And I'm sure
you're an expert on that, hmm?

04:06.205 --> 04:07.457
Oh, yes, indeedy, I am.

04:07.540 --> 04:11.336
Wood, you are
the least romantic man I know.

04:11.419 --> 04:14.380
I think that I am Mr. Romance.

04:14.464 --> 04:19.135
You know, I believe in that shit
like flowers, candy, all that.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.054
Just not every day.

04:21.137 --> 04:22.889
That's not me.

04:22.972 --> 04:25.892
- It could be cold. Know what I mean?
- That's what I'm talking about. Oh!

04:26.601 --> 04:28.478
Can we...

04:30.355 --> 04:32.065
love?

04:40.114 --> 04:45.912
"'Romance is dead' is what they said
while sitting around, cheating at pool.

04:45.995 --> 04:49.374
At the very last frame
of this nine-ball game,

04:49.457 --> 04:52.543
the cat who had the date
on the top of the Empire State

04:52.627 --> 04:55.129
is the one who got hustled like a fool."

04:56.589 --> 04:59.175
- You watch too many movies, Sheila.
- Step off, Ed. All right?

04:59.258 --> 05:00.510
What's up?

05:02.804 --> 05:06.891
Romance is about
the possibility of the thing.

05:06.975 --> 05:11.771
You see, it's about the time between
when you first meet some fine-ass woman

05:12.397 --> 05:14.107
and when you first make love to her.

05:15.191 --> 05:18.778
Or when you first ask a woman to
marry you and when she says, "I do."

05:19.320 --> 05:23.324
When people who have been together for a
long time say that the romance is gone...

05:24.742 --> 05:26.494
...what they really saying is

05:27.286 --> 05:30.039
- they've exhausted the possibility.
- Mm-mm-mmm.

05:30.123 --> 05:32.083
- Savon.
- Now you're talking about my thing.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.626
They won't hear me, bruh.

05:33.710 --> 05:35.795
- Go on.
- It's like poetry

05:35.878 --> 05:37.630
is the possibility of language.

05:38.589 --> 05:39.590
- Please.
- Ooh.

05:39.674 --> 05:40.925
Give me a break.

05:41.009 --> 05:43.511
- Where you want it at?
- Hey, Von, let me get my lighter, man.

05:43.594 --> 05:44.846
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

05:44.929 --> 05:47.432
- I said Savon.
- I know what you said.

05:47.515 --> 05:50.893
- I don't know what's wrong with that girl.
- No, he doesn't need to be smoking.

05:50.977 --> 05:52.645
- Thank you, Mom.
- You're welcome.

05:52.729 --> 05:54.772
I thought we left our mothers at home.

05:54.856 --> 05:58.526
- Do you want another drink?
- Actually, I am okay for now.

05:59.277 --> 06:01.571
I'm going to get one.
I'm bringing you one anyway.

06:01.654 --> 06:03.494
Thank you,
'cause I'ma hit this off real quick.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.284
Hey, Will, let me get another one, man.

06:06.993 --> 06:08.286
Cool.

06:10.580 --> 06:11.831
White wine, please.

06:15.084 --> 06:17.336
Who's that girl with Darius? Damn.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.380
She does have
a little somethin'-somethin'.

06:19.464 --> 06:22.341
- Uh, excuse me, Mr. Married Man.
- I am married, I am not blind.

06:22.425 --> 06:24.761
Brother, can you see through these,
please? Can you see —

06:24.844 --> 06:27.847
- Everything is checking out.
- That's what I'm talking about.

06:27.930 --> 06:29.515
- Niggas just ain't right.
- Niggas?

06:29.599 --> 06:32.310
- Why we gotta be ni —
- Because that's what y'all are.

06:40.568 --> 06:41.819
Deep in thought, huh?

06:44.906 --> 06:45.948
Yeah.

06:49.452 --> 06:51.120
What are you thinking about?

06:53.664 --> 06:55.249
A woman I saw once.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.878
She must have been fine.

07:00.088 --> 07:02.256
Savon,
you can't tell me that these babes

07:02.340 --> 07:04.801
can't see that cool pose shit
coming a mile off.

07:04.884 --> 07:07.845
You know, brother,
jealousy is a sickness.

07:07.929 --> 07:09.138
- Let it go, man.
- Sickness.

07:09.222 --> 07:10.556
Let it go.

07:11.349 --> 07:13.518
And just walk away.

07:13.601 --> 07:14.936
Fuck you, Ed.

07:17.563 --> 07:18.981
Darius Lovehall.

07:21.234 --> 07:22.235
Nina Mosley.

07:27.031 --> 07:29.075
That'll be $4.00.

07:29.158 --> 07:30.827
Fumble, just like I told you.

07:30.910 --> 07:33.037
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.

07:33.121 --> 07:35.206
- Will, put this on your tab.
- Yeah, right.

07:35.289 --> 07:36.767
- Put that energy out there.
- Say "thank you."

07:36.791 --> 07:38.251
You put it out there.

07:38.334 --> 07:39.335
That's a fumble, bro.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.045
You put the energy out —

07:41.129 --> 07:43.214
- Anybody in here can see that.
- Oh, please.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.258
- Sorry about that.
- Here you go.

07:45.341 --> 07:47.093
Try not to knock this one over.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.431
Maybe you should quit smoking.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.648
All right, all right. Get settled.

08:00.731 --> 08:02.441
We're back.

08:02.525 --> 08:05.444
This next brother up on the mike
writes for <i>New City</i>

08:05.528 --> 08:07.446
and is regularly here on Monday nights.

08:07.530 --> 08:12.326
So please,
give it to Mr. Darius Lovehall.

08:19.041 --> 08:21.002
- Thank you, brother Ed.
- All right.

08:21.961 --> 08:24.964
All right, this is a little something
I've been working on.

08:25.047 --> 08:26.299
It's new.

08:26.382 --> 08:27.800
I call it, uh...

08:30.428 --> 08:31.679
"A Blues for Nina."

08:32.388 --> 08:34.098
Yes, baby!

08:35.266 --> 08:37.852
- All right! Uh-huh.
- Yeah. Take your time.

08:43.858 --> 08:45.193
My man!

08:53.242 --> 08:54.619
Say, baby.

08:55.578 --> 08:56.871
Can I be your slave?

08:58.998 --> 09:01.667
I've got to admit, girl,
you're the shit, girl,

09:02.418 --> 09:04.587
and I'm digging you like a grave.

09:06.631 --> 09:09.759
Now, do they call you daughter
to the spinning pulsar?

09:09.842 --> 09:12.887
Or maybe Queen of 10,000 Moons?

09:13.846 --> 09:16.474
Sister to the distant, yet rising star.

09:17.475 --> 09:19.352
Is your name Yemaya?

09:22.563 --> 09:24.815
Oh, hell no. It's got to be Oshun.

09:29.779 --> 09:32.615
Is that a smile
me put on your face, child,

09:33.532 --> 09:36.160
wide as a field of jasmine and clover?

09:37.870 --> 09:39.163
Talk that talk, honey,

09:39.247 --> 09:41.624
walk that walk, money,

09:41.707 --> 09:44.669
high on legs that'll spite Jehovah.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.046
Shit.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.839
Who am I?

09:48.923 --> 09:50.675
It's not important.

09:51.676 --> 09:54.679
- But they call me brother to the night.
- Well, all right!

09:54.762 --> 09:58.849
And right now,
I'm the blues in your left thigh...

10:00.935 --> 10:03.479
tryin' to become the funk in your right.

10:05.314 --> 10:06.649
Who am I?

10:07.650 --> 10:09.277
I'll be whoever you say.

10:10.319 --> 10:12.613
But right now I'm the sight-raped hunter

10:12.697 --> 10:15.157
blindly pursuing you as my prey.

10:15.908 --> 10:19.078
And I just wanna give you injections
of sublime erections

10:19.161 --> 10:21.163
and get you to dance to my rhythm,

10:21.247 --> 10:24.625
make you dream archetypes
of Black angels in flight

10:24.709 --> 10:29.630
upon wings of distorted, contorted,
metaphoric jism.

10:30.673 --> 10:32.466
Aw, come on, slim.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.511
Fuck your man.
I ain't worried about him.

10:37.847 --> 10:40.308
It's you who I want to step to my scene.

10:40.975 --> 10:43.853
'Cause rather than deal with the fallacy
of this dry-ass reality,

10:44.437 --> 10:48.107
I'd rather dance and romance
your sweet ass in a wet dream.

10:51.694 --> 10:53.654
Who am I?

10:53.738 --> 10:56.407
Well, they all call me
brother to the night,

10:57.116 --> 11:00.202
and right now
I'm the blues in your left thigh...

11:02.079 --> 11:05.374
tryin' to become the funk in your right.

11:09.170 --> 11:11.505
Oh, that's all right, baby!

11:15.926 --> 11:17.303
Bravo!

11:19.722 --> 11:21.515
Darius Lovehall.

11:30.941 --> 11:32.610
Wonderful.

11:33.235 --> 11:35.363
Absolutely wonderful.

11:35.446 --> 11:38.616
No, no, no, come on now, Wood. You
gotta give him his props for that one.

11:38.699 --> 11:41.053
You gotta give it up, Wood.
Give it up. Come on, give it up.

11:41.077 --> 11:42.453
Yeah, whatever.

11:42.536 --> 11:45.956
But I'll tell you one thing —
I don't need poetry to get women.

11:46.040 --> 11:49.126
- No, you need a personality to get women.
- Mmm. Mmm.

11:49.210 --> 11:52.296
Try a breath mint and a Visa.

11:53.631 --> 11:55.716
Played out like an eight-track.

11:56.384 --> 11:58.386
You did say that, didn't you?

12:01.931 --> 12:03.933
Here come your boy. Here come your boy.

12:04.016 --> 12:05.184
- What's up, D?
- Hey.

12:05.267 --> 12:07.728
- D, great poem.
- Y'all liked that, huh?

12:07.812 --> 12:09.480
- It was fascinating.
- Be nice.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.023
- Thanks.
- Look at that.

12:11.107 --> 12:13.067
- Who's Nina?
- I loved it, Darius.

12:13.150 --> 12:15.444
Green glob just
coming all out your mouth.

12:15.528 --> 12:16.904
You don't know me like that.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.447
We need to embrace this brother.

12:18.531 --> 12:19.990
You're a bad influence.

12:20.074 --> 12:21.617
- Every last — Especially you.
- Why?

12:21.700 --> 12:25.079
- You're the worst influence of all.
- Oh, don't even try. Don't even —

12:28.791 --> 12:30.167
Thanks for my poem.

12:30.793 --> 12:33.838
It was, um... interesting.

12:34.547 --> 12:35.840
No problem.

12:36.382 --> 12:38.509
Everybody, this is, uh, Nina.

12:39.135 --> 12:41.137
- Hi.
- Sheila. Ed.

12:41.220 --> 12:43.889
- Savon. And that's Hollywood.
- How you doing, Nina?

12:43.973 --> 12:47.518
- This is my girl, Josie.
- Hello, hello, hello, hello.

12:47.601 --> 12:50.354
So, maybe next week
you could write something for me.

12:51.021 --> 12:52.064
Maybe.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.150
But it won't be about sex.

12:54.233 --> 12:56.777
What's wrong with sex?

12:59.405 --> 13:01.991
There's nothing wrong with sex.
There's just other topics.

13:02.992 --> 13:04.326
Like what?

13:12.251 --> 13:14.628
Oh, God.

13:15.421 --> 13:17.339
Where did you go?

13:23.762 --> 13:26.682
But you probably
wouldn't know anything about that.

13:32.730 --> 13:34.440
Good night, Black people.

13:34.523 --> 13:36.650
- Good night.
- Good night, sister.

13:38.110 --> 13:39.945
Oh, man!

13:40.905 --> 13:42.656
Well, damn.

13:42.740 --> 13:46.660
Yo, man, if that was me,
I'd be in her car right now.

13:46.744 --> 13:48.120
- Okay?
- You know.

13:48.204 --> 13:49.288
- Whoo!
- Get back.

13:49.371 --> 13:52.374
You got your hand pulled there,
like, so smooth.

13:52.458 --> 13:54.561
Maybe if your hand was a little bigger
she could write your number down.

13:54.585 --> 13:55.836
Close your mouth.

13:55.920 --> 13:58.672
Y'all just mad
'cause somebody approached me.

13:58.756 --> 14:01.675
- No. What is the secret?
- Oh, oh, oh, come on.

14:01.759 --> 14:04.261
Oh, Pookie, come on, man!

14:04.345 --> 14:07.890
Yes. Come on, more. Yes.

14:07.973 --> 14:10.309
More. Bigger. Yes!

14:10.392 --> 14:11.894
That one's a cover.

14:12.728 --> 14:14.855
Okay. Now...

14:21.070 --> 14:26.325
Um... this isn't curried chicken,
and they were out of baguettes. Sorry.

14:31.247 --> 14:33.791
Roger, come on, give me a break.
This is only lunch.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.918
It isn't about the bloody lunch, Nina.

14:36.961 --> 14:41.090
I don't think this, uh,
assistant thing is working out.

14:41.173 --> 14:43.801
I suspect you don't have
the temperament for it.

14:45.553 --> 14:48.264
Perhaps you'd be better off on your own.

14:50.558 --> 14:54.311
Yeah, man, I'ma head on back over to
the office, get the rest of my things.

14:54.395 --> 14:57.523
Man, I can't believe
I'm finally up out of there.

14:57.606 --> 14:59.650
Hey, but y'all don't worry about me.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.611
I saved up enough cash
to hold me for a while, all right?

15:02.695 --> 15:05.447
Cool. Just hook us up in the dedication
for the book, man.

15:05.531 --> 15:09.034
Man, look, just because you been there
for me in the times I needed you,

15:09.118 --> 15:11.620
don't mean I got to put you
in my book, all right?

15:11.704 --> 15:13.539
- Hey —
- No shout-outs, baby, no shout-outs.

15:22.464 --> 15:23.549
- Nina.
- Sheila?

15:23.632 --> 15:24.967
Yeah.

15:25.050 --> 15:28.345
- How you doing?
- Girl, I need an Isley Brothers CD badly.

15:28.429 --> 15:30.764
Mm-hmm, I hear you.
The CDs are in the back.

15:30.848 --> 15:32.891
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

15:41.066 --> 15:43.319
- Yo, She. What's going on, girl?
- Hey. What's up?

15:43.402 --> 15:45.529
- Chillin', man. What's happening?
- Not much.

15:45.613 --> 15:48.616
- Y'all slow as hell up in here today.
- But it'll speed up.

15:48.699 --> 15:50.034
What you talkin' about?

15:55.331 --> 15:56.957
Oh, shit.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.711
Hey, um,
would you hold this for a second?

16:01.545 --> 16:04.548
- Why you gonna give me your junk?
- Just be cool, cool.

16:14.058 --> 16:15.392
Ah, Al Green.

16:17.144 --> 16:20.522
You know you can't go wrong
with my man Al Green.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.359
Darius, right?

16:29.156 --> 16:32.242
Say, uh, y-you mind if I play you
a little something real quick?

16:33.327 --> 16:34.370
I don't know.

16:34.453 --> 16:37.539
The last time you went on an impulse,
you embarrassed the shit out of me.

16:38.791 --> 16:40.668
Look, this will be easy.

16:40.751 --> 16:42.419
I promise. Watch.

16:54.640 --> 16:55.724
Yeah.

17:11.532 --> 17:13.033
Charlie Parker.

17:13.659 --> 17:16.161
- I've never heard this particular —
- Shh.

17:31.593 --> 17:32.886
It's kinda sad.

17:34.847 --> 17:37.391
Melancholy, maybe, but, uh, not sad.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.061
There's a difference, I think.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.276
Maybe you're right.

17:57.161 --> 17:59.705
My new information's on there.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.623
Okay, great.

18:01.707 --> 18:02.875
Here you go.

18:06.211 --> 18:08.964
Dr. Wax will have
that Isley Brothers CD.

18:09.047 --> 18:11.467
- Thanks. See you later.
- Yeah, all right. Bye-bye.

18:11.550 --> 18:16.680
Say, uh, you know, you and I
should, uh, get together sometime

18:16.764 --> 18:18.724
and, you know, have some drinks.

18:18.807 --> 18:21.643
Um, I don't think
that'd be a very good idea.

18:23.812 --> 18:24.813
Well, why not?

18:26.398 --> 18:28.734
It's just bad timing. Nothing personal.

18:29.318 --> 18:31.403
I understand.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.449
Thanks for the record.

18:38.327 --> 18:39.328
Damn.

18:48.462 --> 18:50.798
Messed that shit up.

18:50.881 --> 18:53.467
When are you gonna learn?

18:53.550 --> 18:56.637
You move too fast.
See, women like it slow and easy.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.138
Didn't I school you?

19:01.767 --> 19:04.603
Yo, why don't you let me
get her little address real quick?

19:05.562 --> 19:06.939
How would I do that?

19:07.022 --> 19:08.649
'Cause it's on the check, man.

19:08.732 --> 19:10.776
- Why would I do that?
- Because you're my girl.

19:10.859 --> 19:13.463
You supposed to be looking out —
Come on, stop playing. Hook me up, man.

19:13.487 --> 19:15.155
- I'm not playing. No.
- Why?

19:15.239 --> 19:17.533
Look, what if her man comes to the door?

19:17.616 --> 19:18.909
Her m —

19:20.035 --> 19:21.453
Her man.

19:22.871 --> 19:25.624
Damn, I ain't think about that. Her man.

19:26.959 --> 19:28.585
Yeah, you right. I'm buggin'.

19:57.823 --> 20:01.910
Wh — W-What are you doing here?
How did you know where I live?

20:01.994 --> 20:06.290
Look, I know it's a little strange for me
just to show up to your place like this.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.125
Yeah, what did you do? Follow me home?

20:08.208 --> 20:11.003
No! No, no, I — Nothing like that.

20:11.837 --> 20:13.297
Well, um —

20:13.380 --> 20:15.132
Well, actually, I, uh —

20:15.215 --> 20:20.012
I got your address from the check
that you wrote down at the record store.

20:20.095 --> 20:22.806
Look, I know that wasn't very cool,

20:22.890 --> 20:25.058
and I apologize.

20:25.142 --> 20:27.394
But I got that CD you were looking for.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.064
Isley Brothers, right?

20:32.900 --> 20:33.984
Yeah.

20:35.444 --> 20:37.654
This — This is the one. Thanks.

20:37.738 --> 20:39.197
No problem.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.247
Wh-What? You trying to come in?

20:47.331 --> 20:48.874
Yeah — I mean, no, no.

20:48.957 --> 20:53.795
Yeah — Uh, sure. I mean, if—
if you're not busy or doing anything.

20:56.423 --> 21:00.093
Um, well, y-you can come in.

21:00.177 --> 21:01.595
- You sure?
- Yeah.

21:02.512 --> 21:04.556
Hope I'm not intruding.

21:13.231 --> 21:15.734
Nice little pad you got here.

21:15.817 --> 21:17.277
I'm just house-sitting.

21:17.778 --> 21:19.363
Oh, a photographer.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.950
Yeah.

21:23.033 --> 21:24.534
Dig that. It's nice.

21:27.829 --> 21:29.998
why are you here?

21:30.082 --> 21:31.917
Said it was bad timing.

21:33.001 --> 21:36.171
And I figured if I asked again
maybe you'd say yes.

21:36.254 --> 21:38.924
And if not that time,
then maybe the next time.

21:39.007 --> 21:41.760
Till the next time
became the right time.

21:43.929 --> 21:45.097
Persistence.

21:45.180 --> 21:47.933
You'd be surprised
how far it can get you.

22:00.696 --> 22:04.741
Reminds me of stuff Gordon Parks
was shootin' for <i>Life</i> magazine.

22:04.825 --> 22:06.785
Do you know a lot about photography?

22:06.868 --> 22:08.870
A little somethin'-somethin'.

22:08.954 --> 22:11.164
I know that you have a great eye.

22:12.290 --> 22:16.086
So you're just like, uh,
a Renaissance Black man?

22:16.169 --> 22:18.338
Poetry, music, photography.

22:18.422 --> 22:21.591
Think it was somebody that said
something about Mozart.

22:22.759 --> 22:27.597
"The goal of an artist is to create the
definitive work that cannot be surpassed."

22:28.974 --> 22:31.435
Guess you can say
I kinda live like that.

22:34.271 --> 22:37.065
Well, that was actually
George Bernard Shaw.

22:37.149 --> 22:39.609
Now you trying too hard.

22:40.736 --> 22:42.654
Mmm. Okay.

22:44.906 --> 22:46.616
I'm beginning to like this.

22:48.410 --> 22:51.663
Um, well, uh, don't like it too much.

22:52.330 --> 22:54.124
Check it out.

22:54.207 --> 22:57.836
Couple friends of mine are having
this get-together tomorrow night and,

22:57.919 --> 22:59.838
well, I want you to come hang with me.

23:00.464 --> 23:02.591
Maybe we can start
to like this together.

23:02.674 --> 23:06.053
Hmm. So, what, are you
asking me out on a date?

23:06.136 --> 23:07.471
Again?

23:07.554 --> 23:09.389
I guess that's about the size of it,
yeah.

23:10.265 --> 23:11.975
- So...
- I don't — I don't know.

23:12.059 --> 23:13.935
Aw, no, no, no, no, no, no. Look.

23:14.019 --> 23:17.189
Don't make me start
bringing more CDs up here, okay?

23:17.272 --> 23:20.108
'Cause I'll start
bringing you Prince CDs.

23:20.192 --> 23:23.153
And you know how that brother likes to
pump out four, five albums a week.

23:23.236 --> 23:25.156
- Oh, please.
- I mean, I'll be here up every day

23:25.197 --> 23:27.282
- just all in your face.
- Okay, okay, all right.

23:27.365 --> 23:29.659
I'll save you the trouble.

23:29.743 --> 23:30.827
Yes.

23:30.911 --> 23:34.289
I'll just come by
about 8:00, 8:15 tomorrow and get you.

23:34.998 --> 23:37.375
- Okay.
- Cool. Hope you enjoy your CD.

23:37.459 --> 23:38.710
Thanks.

23:41.630 --> 23:46.134
the next time you decide to just,
um, stop by, you should call first.

23:46.218 --> 23:48.428
'Cause I know you wrote
the phone number down.

23:49.805 --> 23:53.391
Yeah, you right. I got your number.

24:05.112 --> 24:09.991
Listen, the last time we was over here,
no disrespect, the food was crazy.

24:10.075 --> 24:13.286
Those constant and annoying references
to my wife's cooking —

24:15.997 --> 24:18.500
Here she comes. Be quiet.
Here she comes. Here she comes.

24:18.583 --> 24:22.129
Don't be talking about me
with your microwave-cooking ass.

24:24.297 --> 24:27.134
Troy, and then she
gon' come out here with carrots.

24:27.217 --> 24:29.928
- That's right.
- Do I have two big front teeth?

24:30.011 --> 24:32.556
- Is there somebody —
- Get you some better carrots.

24:32.639 --> 24:34.474
You can't see as it is.

24:34.558 --> 24:35.642
Fuck y'all.

24:35.725 --> 24:38.311
I'm about to bang out
some wickedness out of you, boy.

24:38.395 --> 24:40.188
Bring the levity back.

24:41.064 --> 24:44.276
- We gotta get something going up in here.
- Oh, don't start it up.

24:44.359 --> 24:45.694
Come on, now, Savon.

24:45.777 --> 24:48.572
Bring it back. Exercise that.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.657
Come on, man.

24:52.701 --> 24:55.829
No, Sheila, Sheila, Sheila.

24:55.912 --> 24:57.122
Oh, man.

25:04.254 --> 25:07.591
- Don't come over here with that.
- Whoo!

25:07.674 --> 25:11.261
That's enough. Go over there!
Quit! Get out of here. Quit it.

25:11.344 --> 25:14.504
Quit fucking around with them spirits.
You gonna get everybody in here pregnant.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.766
You fuck around and get us pregnant
with that shit.

25:16.850 --> 25:19.769
- Take that shit to Flynn, Sheila.
- Baby, Flynn get it on!

25:19.853 --> 25:22.272
- Don't worry about Flynn.
- He can — He can keep it on.

25:24.232 --> 25:25.775
You scared?

25:25.859 --> 25:28.320
- Scared of what?
- God.

25:28.403 --> 25:30.906
I know Jesus.

25:32.866 --> 25:34.868
- God is a woman, honey.
- Ooh.

25:34.951 --> 25:36.203
Okay.

25:36.286 --> 25:38.622
All righty, then.

25:38.705 --> 25:41.625
No, no, no, no, hold up, hold up.
God is a woman.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.043
Look, D.

25:43.126 --> 25:45.503
We don't get it. Know what I mean?

25:45.587 --> 25:48.256
- We with you and everything, but, damn.
- No, no, hold on.

25:48.340 --> 25:52.636
If you ever chased a woman, you
know that women have a certain power,

25:52.719 --> 25:56.431
a certain sexual thing that renders men
totally incapable of functioning.

25:56.932 --> 25:58.242
- Am I right, Von?
- That's right.

25:58.266 --> 25:59.946
I mean, that shit
drives us to distraction.

26:00.018 --> 26:01.019
That's right.

26:01.102 --> 26:03.897
- Destruction. Look at that kitchen.
- Okay.

26:03.980 --> 26:07.067
Go look in that kitchen.

26:07.150 --> 26:10.111
A male God would never allow
a creature made in his own image

26:10.195 --> 26:12.530
- to get jammed up like that.
- Uh, wait, excuse me.

26:12.614 --> 26:16.618
But why are you trying to
impress your date?

26:16.701 --> 26:18.286
I ain't trying to impress no one.

26:18.370 --> 26:20.288
'Cause you know
you wouldn't even believe that.

26:20.372 --> 26:22.457
He's just telling the truth.

26:22.540 --> 26:27.796
Savon, break it down for those who
don't understand what I'm talking about.

26:27.879 --> 26:29.214
Oh, hold on. Hold up.

26:29.297 --> 26:33.635
Let me break it down so it can forever
and consistently be broke.

26:33.718 --> 26:35.011
- Okay.
- Oh.

26:35.095 --> 26:36.930
- All right?
- Speak on it. Go ahead.

26:37.013 --> 26:39.182
Now, when a man gets a hard-on,

26:39.266 --> 26:41.476
you know where
the blood comes from, right?

26:41.559 --> 26:43.353
Know where the blood comes from, right?

26:43.436 --> 26:44.813
- His brain...
- Mm-hmm.

26:44.896 --> 26:46.273
- ...and his feet.
- And his feet.

26:46.356 --> 26:49.484
- True.
- So, A... he's stupid,

26:50.110 --> 26:52.237
and B, he can't run.

26:54.572 --> 26:57.450
Only a woman God
thinks about shit like that.

26:58.618 --> 27:00.036
That's how she got you, right?

27:00.120 --> 27:02.163
- That's it. That's what happened.
- That's it.

27:03.999 --> 27:06.042
- Damn!
- But no, see, that's some bullshit.

27:06.126 --> 27:09.462
'Cause I got it now. I got--
I figured it out, I figured it out.

27:09.546 --> 27:12.215
- This has become a regular forum.
- What, what? I'm for real.

27:12.299 --> 27:14.402
We getting ready to have
some Hollywood philosophizing —

27:14.426 --> 27:17.178
- Yes!
- I can't wait.

27:17.262 --> 27:19.097
Think about this. Anatomy.

27:19.723 --> 27:22.350
Now, if God was really a woman...

27:23.351 --> 27:24.936
y'all know how God think.

27:25.020 --> 27:28.148
She'd have put the dick
right under the chin.

27:30.275 --> 27:32.402
- Take care of her business —
- You are sick!

27:32.485 --> 27:35.113
What? Aw, man!

27:35.196 --> 27:37.490
Hey, it ain't — Hey!

27:41.202 --> 27:44.080
Yo, yo, can you get some chips, man?

27:44.164 --> 27:47.876
I'm sick of y'all. Y'all trippin'.
Y'all sure know how to treat a person.

27:50.211 --> 27:54.049
I was 15 and my dad gave me
this old Topcon when he was in the navy.

27:54.132 --> 27:56.343
And ever since then I've been hooked.

27:56.426 --> 27:58.678
You shoot,
but what you know about writing?

27:59.721 --> 28:04.684
"I gather up each sound you left behind
and stretch them on our bed.

28:04.768 --> 28:07.520
Each night I breathe
you and become high."

28:08.730 --> 28:10.357
Check you out, girl.

28:10.440 --> 28:11.441
That's yours?

28:11.524 --> 28:14.527
- No, it's Sanchez. I'm a lifelong fan.
- Mmm.

28:14.611 --> 28:16.363
She makes me wanna burn my notebook.

28:16.446 --> 28:20.367
Aw, no. See, it's about
reaching your level, not hers.

28:20.909 --> 28:23.745
I thought it was about
the definitive work.

28:23.828 --> 28:27.582
Yeah, well, Mozart was the exception.
Like Bird.

28:27.665 --> 28:29.876
- You have all the answers, don't you?
- Mm-mmm.

28:29.959 --> 28:32.295
Just all the questions.

28:32.379 --> 28:34.005
You're cocky.

28:34.089 --> 28:35.882
- It's cute.
- Aw, cute.

28:37.133 --> 28:39.928
So, uh, check it out.
Do you like reggae music?

28:40.011 --> 28:41.012
Yeah.

28:41.096 --> 28:42.806
Well, let's go to the Wild Hare.

28:42.889 --> 28:45.642
I wanna see
the little Yankee girl dancing tonight.

28:45.725 --> 28:48.103
You wanna drive all the way up
to the north side tonight?

28:48.186 --> 28:51.439
Tonight, man!
Me wanna feel a little bump and grind.

28:51.523 --> 28:53.566
What if it starts raining again?

28:53.650 --> 28:58.154
Aw, don't tell me you're
afraid of getting a little wet tonight.

30:44.385 --> 30:46.804
- Thanks.
- No thang.

30:46.888 --> 30:48.598
I had a really good time.

30:49.349 --> 30:50.558
My pleasure.

31:00.652 --> 31:03.446
I'm — I'm sorry.

31:04.614 --> 31:07.033
Look, uh, I should go.

31:07.116 --> 31:10.870
Darius, look. I-I had a
really good time. I really did.

31:10.954 --> 31:14.666
It's just that, I can't go out like that
on the first date. I mean, come on.

31:15.250 --> 31:16.584
I understand.

31:16.668 --> 31:19.379
I mean, we just got a chance
to know each other.

31:19.462 --> 31:21.172
- We just getting honest and —
- Right.

31:30.932 --> 31:34.519
- Wait, look. I should go. All right?
- Yeah, 'cause —

31:34.602 --> 31:36.312
- It's getting late, so, uh —
- Mm-hmm.

31:36.396 --> 31:38.022
- Maybe I — I'll call you.
- Okay.

31:38.106 --> 31:39.691
- That's cool.
- All right.

31:39.774 --> 31:41.276
- Thanks.
- Good night.

31:42.360 --> 31:43.861
Look, Nina.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.532
I just wanna come up and talk.

31:54.831 --> 31:56.291
You heard that all right?

31:58.501 --> 31:59.752
Come on.

33:28.132 --> 33:29.425
Good morning.

33:29.509 --> 33:30.635
Morning.

33:31.386 --> 33:36.140
I see you, uh...
found your way to the kitchen.

33:36.224 --> 33:37.392
Oh, yeah.

33:37.475 --> 33:38.601
Hope you don't mind.

33:38.685 --> 33:39.852
Nah, it's cool.

33:39.936 --> 33:41.312
Got some omelets happening.

33:41.396 --> 33:43.981
- This is for me?
- Yeah, this is for you.

33:44.065 --> 33:45.400
Thank you.

33:52.115 --> 33:53.866
Look, uh...

33:56.494 --> 33:58.037
I really dig you, Nina.

33:59.122 --> 34:01.791
And I hope we didn't move too fast,
you know.

34:02.834 --> 34:05.461
Nothing happened
that I didn't want to happen.

34:06.587 --> 34:08.881
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

34:10.091 --> 34:12.719
- It's a great thing.
- Oh, it's great.

34:12.802 --> 34:16.597
Oh, good. Cool. All right, yeah.

34:16.681 --> 34:20.017
So, uh,
guess we can hook up again, right?

34:23.271 --> 34:27.775
Now, wait a minute. Now,
you ain't gonna fade me out, are you?

34:29.819 --> 34:31.320
Good. Whew!

34:31.404 --> 34:35.408
I tell you,
I can't stand to sleep with a woman

34:35.491 --> 34:37.827
and afterward she just dog you out.

34:37.910 --> 34:39.996
You know how y'all do.

34:40.079 --> 34:42.582
Don't return any of your phone calls.

34:42.665 --> 34:45.543
Play me off in front of your friends
like you don't know me,

34:45.626 --> 34:47.420
like nothing ever happened.

34:48.004 --> 34:51.466
Look, I'm gonna get myself
an omelet. You want anything else?

34:52.717 --> 34:54.761
Don't ask that question.

34:56.262 --> 35:00.475
Uh, would you, uh, like anything else?

35:01.392 --> 35:04.604
What you gonna do?
You gonna have him or what?

35:04.687 --> 35:06.981
Girl, please. I-I — No.

35:07.064 --> 35:08.900
I would hurt him too badly.

35:14.238 --> 35:16.365
You fucked him, didn't you?

35:18.618 --> 35:20.286
And you weren't even gonna tell me.

35:20.369 --> 35:22.371
You ain't slick.

35:23.080 --> 35:26.000
You can't keep that
kind of shit from me.

35:26.083 --> 35:29.504
I can't believe you fucked him
on the first date.

35:32.215 --> 35:33.883
You a ho!

35:34.592 --> 35:36.010
Slut puppy!

35:36.093 --> 35:39.555
Girl, I didn't — I didn't plan to.
It just sort of happened.

35:39.639 --> 35:42.058
You just sort of slipped
and fell on his dick.

35:42.141 --> 35:43.893
Yeah.

35:43.976 --> 35:46.437
Well, all right. Okay, okay, okay.

35:46.521 --> 35:49.482
All right,
so I wanna know all the details.

35:49.565 --> 35:51.275
How big, how long, everything.

35:51.359 --> 35:53.361
Girl, look at you!

35:53.444 --> 35:55.154
Well, unfortunately,

35:55.238 --> 35:59.450
I have to live vicariously
through your sex life, Miss Nina.

36:01.369 --> 36:02.578
All right, okay.

36:04.205 --> 36:07.416
I ca — I can't even describe it.
'Cause —

36:07.917 --> 36:09.836
It was like...

36:09.919 --> 36:11.921
It was like his dick just...

36:13.840 --> 36:15.341
talked to me.

36:20.429 --> 36:22.181
What it say?

36:23.683 --> 36:24.725
Just...

36:25.810 --> 36:27.144
"Nina."

36:33.192 --> 36:35.194
Damn.

36:36.237 --> 36:40.074
- Damn!
- Oh, girl. I'm telling you.

36:40.992 --> 36:43.411
But look, don't even —
don't even get all geeked up.

36:43.494 --> 36:45.913
'Cause this is nothing serious.
This is no love thing.

36:45.997 --> 36:48.624
Me and Darius, we are just kickin' it.

36:51.335 --> 36:52.545
Troy.

36:53.546 --> 36:54.547
Troy.

36:54.630 --> 36:57.008
Savon, I am so tired of your bullshit.

36:57.091 --> 37:00.052
- Troy. Would you just wait a minute?
- Stop.

37:00.136 --> 37:04.140
You always said you never wanted
to be labeled as trifling or tired —

37:04.223 --> 37:06.183
- Trifling?
- Guess what. You fit the bill.

37:06.267 --> 37:08.311
Does this house
bespeak a person who is trifling?

37:08.394 --> 37:12.690
- Darius. Go get your tired-ass friend.
- No, you keep Darius out of it.

37:12.773 --> 37:14.150
How you doin', Troy?

37:17.486 --> 37:19.572
Don't wait by the phone, Negro.

37:19.655 --> 37:22.116
If you would stop being selfish
and save some money,

37:22.199 --> 37:23.759
we wouldn't be going through this shit!

37:23.826 --> 37:26.704
Savon, get it together!

37:26.787 --> 37:28.080
What?

37:28.164 --> 37:30.625
We were supposed to
go play some pool, remember?

37:30.708 --> 37:31.751
I know that.

37:37.214 --> 37:38.716
Let me ask you something, bruh.

37:39.634 --> 37:41.761
Think you with the woman
you supposed to be with?

37:45.723 --> 37:49.810
That question implies a belief in
destiny, like some cosmic love connection.

37:50.895 --> 37:52.897
I'm not convinced anymore.

37:52.980 --> 37:54.774
Come on, just answer the question.

37:56.901 --> 38:00.029
- You asking me if I married my soul mate?
- Yeah.

38:01.405 --> 38:04.158
Depends on which day you ask.

38:04.241 --> 38:05.368
I dig that.

38:06.869 --> 38:11.582
It doesn't really matter anymore, man.
You're with... who you're with.

38:12.583 --> 38:14.585
You just gotta try to make it work.

38:16.587 --> 38:18.297
Yeah.

38:18.798 --> 38:20.549
Real deep, Von. Real deep, man.

38:20.633 --> 38:24.512
Well, you know, people with profound
insights on life know not to get married.

38:25.388 --> 38:26.597
And those who do...

38:27.807 --> 38:30.142
ought to know that
marriage is what you make it.

38:30.226 --> 38:31.978
Fly. Fly.

38:34.522 --> 38:37.566
Wait a minute.
This is about that girl, Nina, isn't it?

38:37.650 --> 38:41.112
- What you doin', man? Can I get my shot?
- No. This is about that girl, Nina, right?

38:47.868 --> 38:49.578
She jacked you up, didn't she?

38:52.039 --> 38:53.374
Yeah, she jacked me up.

38:54.542 --> 38:56.585
Ooh, man!

38:56.669 --> 38:57.670
Dude.

38:58.254 --> 38:59.547
I mean...

39:00.172 --> 39:02.216
it defies description.

39:02.299 --> 39:06.470
She put the Vodun, the Santería,
the Yoruba, all of it.

39:06.554 --> 39:08.597
She put it on me, man.

39:08.681 --> 39:11.017
Next morning,
I got up and made breakfast.

39:12.476 --> 39:13.811
You made breakfast?

39:14.520 --> 39:16.731
Yeah. I was in there cooking.

39:16.814 --> 39:19.316
Wait a minute. You cooked what?

39:22.194 --> 39:24.613
- Cheese omelets.
- A cheese —

39:24.697 --> 39:26.782
- A cheese omelet?
- Yeah.

39:26.866 --> 39:30.786
You better put your name on that. That's
better than Michael Jordan's comeback.

39:30.870 --> 39:33.706
Best thing since Michael
Jordan's return. I'm serious, man.

39:33.789 --> 39:36.018
So what are we talking about?
Think she's your soul mate?

39:36.042 --> 39:38.335
No. Mm-mmm.

39:39.336 --> 39:42.131
I just said the sex was good,
that's all.

39:43.841 --> 39:46.385
You know, this ain't no love thing.

39:47.720 --> 39:51.015
- Just kickin' it.
- Okay.

39:51.098 --> 39:53.684
Yeah, well, uh, one truism in life,
my friend...

39:55.478 --> 39:57.480
when that jones come down...

40:00.733 --> 40:02.568
it be a motherfucker.

40:08.699 --> 40:11.077
- I hope you cleaned up.
- Why?

40:11.160 --> 40:15.372
I'm not tryin' to find any bobby pins
and stockings and some old makeup.

40:15.456 --> 40:16.540
Girl, please.

40:16.624 --> 40:19.543
Rarely do I divulge the location
to the secret bat cave.

40:19.627 --> 40:22.379
You lucky I ain't knocked your ass out
with some spray.

40:22.463 --> 40:24.256
Come on.

40:25.174 --> 40:28.094
It definitely looks
like a bachelor's pad.

40:28.177 --> 40:30.262
Yeah.

40:34.016 --> 40:36.227
So, what,
you just don't believe in CD's?

40:36.310 --> 40:38.312
It's from my DJ-ing days.

40:38.395 --> 40:40.648
Yeah, I still like that vinyl sound.

40:40.731 --> 40:43.609
Okay.

40:56.080 --> 40:59.583
Oh, wait, wait. This my fashion spread?
Hold on, hold on. Let me get my pose.

41:01.627 --> 41:03.921
Just be natural, silly.

41:05.089 --> 41:06.507
One more.

41:07.758 --> 41:10.594
All right, that's enough
with the camera, all right?

41:12.638 --> 41:14.014
Take off your clothes.

41:15.474 --> 41:16.517
Excuse me?

41:16.600 --> 41:18.602
Take off your clothes.

41:20.771 --> 41:22.773
Take off my clothes.

41:24.650 --> 41:26.402
Aw, man.

41:26.485 --> 41:27.820
Hold up, hold up.

41:29.321 --> 41:31.615
I've already seen what you got.

41:35.536 --> 41:36.954
All right.

41:38.080 --> 41:39.832
You crazy.

42:07.067 --> 42:09.570
Mmm. Yeah.

42:12.823 --> 42:14.992
Now, uh, this wouldn't happen to...

42:16.660 --> 42:20.206
wind up in somebody's... magazine
or book or something, would it?

42:20.289 --> 42:23.667
No, no, baby. This is strictly
for my private collection.

42:28.964 --> 42:31.926
- That's enough with the camera.
- Why? You don't trust me?

42:32.509 --> 42:33.636
I didn't say that.

42:39.975 --> 42:42.269
I think that you're
incredibly beautiful.

42:43.437 --> 42:44.813
- Really?
- Really.

43:07.294 --> 43:08.712
Hey, baby.

43:09.380 --> 43:10.422
Marvin.

43:12.925 --> 43:17.346
If this is the part where you try
to get me back, you can forget it.

43:17.429 --> 43:19.139
Oh, come on now. Hear me out.

43:19.223 --> 43:22.476
Look, baby, I know
I made some mistakes and I'm sorry.

43:23.727 --> 43:24.979
All right, I just...

43:29.233 --> 43:30.276
Shit.

43:30.359 --> 43:34.196
You know I'm no good with this shit.
I'm no good with words. You know that.

43:35.072 --> 43:36.407
Bang.

43:36.490 --> 43:38.575
What is that?

43:38.659 --> 43:40.411
It's a train ticket to New York.

43:40.494 --> 43:43.580
I want you to come and stay with me.
I want us to be together.

43:43.664 --> 43:47.793
Marvin, you had all of that
and you didn't know what to do with it.

43:47.876 --> 43:49.753
Well, I want it again.

43:49.837 --> 43:51.630
How are you gonna just do this to me?

43:51.714 --> 43:54.466
How are you gonna just show up,
come out of nowhere--

43:56.218 --> 44:00.347
Don't you understand that what you want
doesn't matter anymore?

44:00.431 --> 44:02.725
What's the deal? Are you working?
Are you seeing somebody?

44:02.808 --> 44:04.727
I don't think that's
any of your business.

44:04.810 --> 44:07.646
Look, think about it, all right?

44:09.440 --> 44:11.025
You owe me at least that.

44:11.108 --> 44:12.943
I don't owe you anything.

44:15.446 --> 44:17.948
Okay, I gotta go.
I'm meeting my mother for lunch.

44:18.032 --> 44:20.034
Well, you tell her I said hello.

44:21.452 --> 44:22.661
I'll do that.

44:26.540 --> 44:27.666
Okay.

44:35.382 --> 44:37.968
I need to know if I
still love him or not.

44:40.095 --> 44:43.033
What are you shaking your head for?
Don't shake your head. This is serious.

44:43.057 --> 44:45.267
Okay, you're not gonna tell Darius,
are you?

44:45.351 --> 44:46.935
Well, I don't wanna lie to him.

44:52.608 --> 44:53.692
Tell him.

44:53.776 --> 44:54.777
Think so?

44:54.860 --> 44:58.030
If he snaps, then you got him.

44:58.113 --> 45:00.616
And there's no need to go, is there?

45:02.201 --> 45:06.246
But if he tries to act all cool and shit,
then, hey, you just gon' have to go.

45:06.330 --> 45:08.082
Teach his ass a lesson.

45:08.165 --> 45:09.541
Hello, do your thing, girl.

45:10.376 --> 45:11.418
Do it.

45:19.051 --> 45:20.552
Did you want one?

45:21.261 --> 45:22.388
No. No, thanks.

45:29.645 --> 45:32.773
You know I've had a really good time
these past couple weeks, right?

45:33.399 --> 45:35.776
Well, we aim to please.

45:35.859 --> 45:39.029
- I'm serious.
- Me too.

45:46.995 --> 45:51.375
I'm... going, um, away next week.

45:52.126 --> 45:53.585
To New York.

45:55.337 --> 45:56.422
Oh, yeah?

45:57.339 --> 45:58.590
For how long?

46:00.676 --> 46:04.054
Uh, I don't know.
Just, like, a couple weeks.

46:04.138 --> 46:05.556
I don't — I don't know.

46:07.850 --> 46:09.184
Well, what's going on?

46:10.519 --> 46:15.149
I have a couple contacts and I'm gonna
poke around and see if I can find a gig.

46:16.733 --> 46:18.527
And I also have some...

46:20.070 --> 46:22.948
other unfinished business
that I need to take care of.

46:25.325 --> 46:26.702
Some dude.

46:31.373 --> 46:34.376
We used to, um, be in a...

46:36.670 --> 46:40.424
We used to be in a relationship
and I just haven't seen him in a while.

46:42.301 --> 46:44.303
Hey, uh, that's cool.

46:47.014 --> 46:49.016
We were close once. You know?

46:57.191 --> 46:59.151
Darius, the only reason
I'm telling you this

46:59.234 --> 47:01.820
is because I really
care about you and...

47:03.238 --> 47:05.115
I'm not trying to play you.

47:05.949 --> 47:09.453
Hey, I understand.

47:09.536 --> 47:11.705
And I appreciate your honesty.

47:11.788 --> 47:14.082
But we just kickin' it, right?

47:14.166 --> 47:18.712
So it's cool. I mean, go to New York,
do whatever you have to do.

47:19.880 --> 47:23.258
I ain't got no ring on your finger.

47:29.556 --> 47:32.059
So you're not mad?

47:32.142 --> 47:34.019
Hell no, I'm not mad.

47:34.102 --> 47:35.437
I'm mean, it's cool.

47:36.396 --> 47:38.232
We just friends, right?

47:39.775 --> 47:40.943
Yeah.

47:42.069 --> 47:46.823
Because if old boy was doing his job
in the first place, why am I doing it?

47:46.907 --> 47:48.242
- I'm hip.
- Why am I hitting it?

47:48.325 --> 47:49.993
Let me tell you the real deal.

47:50.077 --> 47:53.247
The real deal is,
I don't think she can hang.

47:53.330 --> 47:55.916
Von, I put it on her, boom!

47:55.999 --> 47:57.334
- Put it on her.
- Now she gone.

47:57.417 --> 48:00.045
- Gone?
- I steal, I don't get stole on.

48:00.128 --> 48:01.213
I feel you, D.

48:11.723 --> 48:13.850
These women, man,
they're killing me slowly.

48:15.894 --> 48:17.229
So, wait a minute.

48:18.105 --> 48:20.065
I thought you guys were just...

48:21.275 --> 48:22.651
you know, um...

48:23.944 --> 48:25.028
kickin' it.

48:25.112 --> 48:26.738
That's not the point, Savon.

48:27.447 --> 48:29.324
So what's the point, Black man?

48:29.408 --> 48:32.244
I'll tell you the point.
Have you been listening?

48:32.327 --> 48:34.913
I'ma tell you the point.
I'ma feed you the point.

48:34.997 --> 48:36.623
The point is...

48:37.624 --> 48:40.669
I don't know the point, all right?

48:42.254 --> 48:46.550
It wouldn't be so bad, man,
if I didn't think she was the one.

48:51.722 --> 48:53.724
What you talking 'bout, the one?

48:55.267 --> 48:57.352
I think she's the one, Savon.

49:03.817 --> 49:07.362
I got your ass!
You know I had you going!

49:07.446 --> 49:09.156
- You got me.
- Check you out.

49:09.239 --> 49:11.968
- Why was you giving me that look, man?
- Oh, yeah, you got me. Mm-hmm.

49:11.992 --> 49:13.636
- Nah, man.
- I ain't the only one in here got.

49:13.660 --> 49:15.537
- You slippin' on your boy.
- I slipped.

49:15.621 --> 49:17.414
I had you.
Did you really think I was gon' —

49:18.582 --> 49:19.791
- The one?
- The one.

49:19.875 --> 49:21.293
Please, man.

49:21.960 --> 49:24.963
I'm like a thief in the night.
You know what I mean?

49:25.047 --> 49:27.716
FBI still on my tail
but they can't get me.

49:27.799 --> 49:29.384
I slipped. I'm sorry.

49:29.468 --> 49:30.969
- You done slipped on me.
- I slipped.

49:31.053 --> 49:34.765
'Cause I... I be hittin' that ass
and I'm out. I'm gone.

49:34.848 --> 49:37.351
- What?
- Let me see your wallet, brother.

49:37.434 --> 49:38.828
'Cause there gotta be
"bad motherfucker" on it.

49:38.852 --> 49:40.562
"Bad motherfucker" on it. A'ight?

49:40.646 --> 49:42.356
- Slipped on me. But it's cool.
- Slipped.

49:43.231 --> 49:44.733
Let me see your wallet.

49:49.279 --> 49:50.489
- Hey, John.
- Yo.

49:50.572 --> 49:51.740
Let me get another one.

49:52.491 --> 49:53.700
Coming right up.

50:08.340 --> 50:10.342
I think — Yes.

50:38.078 --> 50:39.579
<i>Hey, dude. What's up? It's Eddie.</i>

50:39.663 --> 50:43.291
<i>Dude, you need to call Savon.
That brother's all strung out over Troy.</i>

50:43.375 --> 50:44.626
<i>Look out.</i>

50:45.669 --> 50:49.506
<i>Hey, Darius, um, it's Nina.</i>

50:50.757 --> 50:52.485
<i>I don't know
when you're gonna get this message,</i>

50:52.509 --> 50:55.178
<i>but my train leaves tonight
at 9:30 and, um...</i>

50:56.221 --> 50:59.516
<i>I don't know, maybe if you're
around Union Station, you'll come down.</i>

51:00.183 --> 51:03.854
<i>Listen, uh, I guess
I'll just call you when I get back. Bye.</i>

51:47.063 --> 51:52.402
Is there any way you could be a...
a bit slicker in your approach?

51:56.490 --> 51:58.325
- What exactly do you mean?
- Slicker.

51:59.409 --> 52:01.578
Just, uh, comparatively slick.

52:01.661 --> 52:03.288
Less raw.

52:04.956 --> 52:07.083
I think you'd have a better chance
of being published

52:07.167 --> 52:10.086
if your work
were just a bit more polished.

52:15.008 --> 52:16.468
You have a nice day.

52:31.775 --> 52:33.360
Where are my toasted oats?

52:33.985 --> 52:35.862
Oh, I finished the box this morning.

52:35.946 --> 52:38.066
Oh, you couldn't eat
the damn Cap'n Crunch, could you?

52:38.114 --> 52:39.574
Oh, please.

52:39.658 --> 52:42.035
Look, I'm sorry. I had a bad day today.

52:42.118 --> 52:44.454
Well, I had a bad day too.

52:45.497 --> 52:47.123
So, you wanna tell me about it?

52:47.707 --> 52:48.834
No.

52:51.461 --> 52:52.504
Baby.

52:53.380 --> 52:57.050
- I hate to see you, you know —
- Wasting my time?

52:57.133 --> 52:58.718
That's not what I meant.

52:58.802 --> 53:00.053
I mean, I can take care of us.

53:00.136 --> 53:01.823
I mean, I just don't want you
to worry about —

53:01.847 --> 53:03.431
Getting a job, right?

53:03.515 --> 53:04.766
Rejection.

53:04.850 --> 53:06.643
And stop finishing my sentences.

53:08.728 --> 53:10.188
I don't even know why I'm here.

53:10.272 --> 53:12.232
Wait a minute. What'd you say?

53:12.315 --> 53:14.818
I don't even know why I'm here.

53:15.944 --> 53:18.424
After all these years together,
you don't know why you're here?

53:18.488 --> 53:21.366
All we have, Marvin,
is all of these years.

53:23.743 --> 53:25.620
And it's just not enough...

53:27.706 --> 53:29.457
anymore.

53:32.460 --> 53:34.880
I'm going out
for some motherfucking toasted oats.

53:37.632 --> 53:38.925
You're trippin'.

53:39.885 --> 53:41.052
For real.

53:41.136 --> 53:44.055
You be talkin' 'bout you're the one
who ate all the cereal.

54:34.105 --> 54:36.650
I already know what I want. Mmm.

54:36.733 --> 54:40.654
Oh, no. Stop. Right now,
stop looking at the girl, man.

54:40.737 --> 54:45.241
See, Ed, I have these amazing powers
over women.

54:47.619 --> 54:49.496
I just can't explain it.

54:50.205 --> 54:52.499
Sort of like a curse or something.

54:53.208 --> 54:56.836
But lucky for you mere mortals,
I use my powers for good.

54:57.629 --> 54:59.381
And not for evil. Know what I'm saying?

55:00.006 --> 55:02.133
The world is truly a safer place.

55:03.093 --> 55:05.679
Girl, I am tired. I'm so sorry.
I gotta get outta here.

55:05.762 --> 55:07.597
I have this interview tomorrow.

55:08.264 --> 55:10.266
It's kinda dead tonight anyway.

55:12.686 --> 55:16.856
There's no cuties in the house.
Not one cutie.

55:16.940 --> 55:19.484
Is there ever a night
when you don't have penis on the brain?

55:20.276 --> 55:21.820
Don't even try it.

55:22.570 --> 55:24.572
You know you came
straight from the station

55:24.656 --> 55:26.425
'cause you wanted
ol' what's-his-name to be here.

55:26.449 --> 55:29.244
Excuse me, but I happen to enjoy poetry.

55:31.079 --> 55:33.081
Don't look at me like that.

55:33.164 --> 55:34.332
I — What?

55:36.418 --> 55:38.461
Save your money. Save it.

55:38.545 --> 55:40.130
It's not happening there.

55:40.213 --> 55:42.173
Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies.

55:42.257 --> 55:44.968
- Why are y'all leaving?
- Wood. I didn't even see you down there.

55:45.051 --> 55:46.970
- Hey.
- Oh. Where y'all going?

55:47.053 --> 55:49.180
Well, you know, we going home. We tired.

55:49.264 --> 55:52.100
Well, uh, I'd like to, uh,
offer you a ride.

55:52.767 --> 55:54.519
I mean, my car is right there.

55:55.729 --> 55:57.022
Oh, that's your car, right?

55:57.731 --> 56:01.526
Oh, no, no. The hearse, the gray one.
That's my car.

56:02.777 --> 56:06.489
That's not like a —
a working hearse?

56:06.573 --> 56:09.284
No, no, ain't been no dead motherfuckers
in there since I bought it.

56:09.367 --> 56:11.077
Girl, we might —

56:11.161 --> 56:16.041
Um, I just remembered that, um, I —
I parked my car down the street.

56:16.124 --> 56:18.376
So what we're gonna do is, um —

56:18.460 --> 56:20.587
- Go.
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.

56:21.588 --> 56:22.630
Bye-bye.

56:22.714 --> 56:24.591
- Girl, he has —
- It's a Cadillac.

56:26.134 --> 56:27.594
He's killing me.

56:28.178 --> 56:29.846
Oh, my God.

56:29.929 --> 56:31.973
He's so cute, though. He's really cute.

56:32.057 --> 56:34.017
Okay, then you should go out with him.

56:34.100 --> 56:36.394
Please, girl.
You know he is not my type.

56:37.145 --> 56:41.232
But I think maybe I should try
to hook you two up.

56:41.316 --> 56:42.400
- No.
- Yes.

56:42.484 --> 56:44.778
No, I'm not trying to
get hooked up by anybody.

56:44.861 --> 56:48.448
Oh, please.
Marvin is officially Black history.

56:48.531 --> 56:53.495
- Wood is very, very cool.
- Wait a second. Don't even try it.

56:53.578 --> 56:56.081
Because I know you. Do not even try—

56:56.164 --> 56:59.375
You try to hook us up
and I'ma... knock you out.

56:59.459 --> 57:03.046
Don't let me have to bring out
my karate, girl.

57:03.129 --> 57:04.214
- Stop. Yeah.
- Pshh.

57:04.297 --> 57:08.593
I'm just saying that — All right, go on.

57:09.761 --> 57:13.181
Go home and call Darius.
It's what you really wanna do anyway.

57:13.264 --> 57:16.142
Why you trying to
make it seem like I'm desperate?

57:16.726 --> 57:19.896
I'll just... call him tomorrow.

58:05.358 --> 58:07.694
- What are you doin' here?
- You the shooter, ain't you?

58:07.777 --> 58:09.863
- Yeah, but —
- Then shoot me, goddamn it.

58:09.946 --> 58:11.990
Immortalize my shit.

58:12.740 --> 58:14.742
How's my light? Hold on.

58:15.368 --> 58:17.048
Is this good for me right here,
this light?

58:17.120 --> 58:19.372
Is this all right? Hold on, wait. Uh...

58:19.455 --> 58:22.083
I can't have you making me look bad,
you know?

58:22.167 --> 58:24.919
Although, you would have to shoot
like my moms to make me look bad,

58:25.003 --> 58:26.963
and she got cataracts.

58:27.046 --> 58:29.007
- Negro, what do you want done today?
- Shit.

58:29.090 --> 58:33.428
I want everything. I want postcards,
wallet sizes, 8-by-10s.

58:33.511 --> 58:34.888
I want the whole nine.

58:34.971 --> 58:37.765
Oh, so you just gonna come up in here
and spend all your money?

58:37.849 --> 58:40.518
Yep.
I will if you let me buy you dinner.

58:43.521 --> 58:45.940
Okay, the Billy Dee thing
is a little played out,

58:46.024 --> 58:48.943
but I will give you ten cool points
for nostalgia's sake.

58:49.027 --> 58:51.362
Nina, I'm serious.

58:53.615 --> 58:55.658
Wood, what do you want from me?

58:56.242 --> 58:57.744
One dinner.

58:58.578 --> 59:01.873
- One dinner?
- It ain't algebra, girl. Come on.

59:04.375 --> 59:06.753
No way. Don't tell me that, please.

59:06.836 --> 59:07.921
- Not bloomers.
- Why?

59:08.004 --> 59:11.132
Bloomers are for,
like, you know, big girls.

59:11.216 --> 59:14.886
What do you mean, they're for big girls?
I like bloomers. They're comfortable.

59:14.969 --> 59:18.009
I mean girls that have ass everywhere.
You got a cute little shape, you know.

59:18.056 --> 59:21.017
And I think you should —
You would look great in, like, a thong.

59:21.809 --> 59:24.479
Not that I was thinking about that.
I'm just saying.

59:24.562 --> 59:27.065
- I'll have to keep that in mind.
- Yeah, I'm serious.

59:27.148 --> 59:29.734
You know, that lady over there,
she wearing bloomers.

59:29.817 --> 59:32.654
- Look how big her ass is.
- Leave that woman alone.

59:32.737 --> 59:35.216
Seriously. She done just knocked
my man's shrimp on the ground.

59:35.240 --> 59:37.867
I'm serious. Look.

59:37.951 --> 59:41.246
- So what kind of underwear do you have on?
- I don't wear drawers.

59:41.829 --> 59:44.332
- You don't have any on right now?
- No, I just let it hang.

1:00:06.980 --> 1:00:08.022
Yeah?

1:00:08.106 --> 1:00:10.942
<i>Hey, what's up, cat daddy?
How's the book coming?</i>

1:00:11.651 --> 1:00:13.528
Masterpiece of minimalism.

1:00:15.321 --> 1:00:16.489
What's going on?

1:00:16.572 --> 1:00:19.492
<i>Ain't nothing. You know
your girl's back in town, right?</i>

1:00:19.575 --> 1:00:21.035
Yeah, I heard.

1:00:22.662 --> 1:00:25.415
And for the last time, man,
she's not my girl. Okay?

1:00:25.498 --> 1:00:28.001
<i>Well, all right.
Well, that's good to hear, my brother.</i>

1:00:28.084 --> 1:00:30.420
<i>Because there's something
I bet you didn't know.</i>

1:00:45.977 --> 1:00:47.895
Look, you coming to my party?

1:00:48.396 --> 1:00:52.191
No, no. I can't mess with y'all's
parties. Y'all don't serve no food.

1:00:52.275 --> 1:00:54.277
- Oh, ain't you something.
- Carrots.

1:00:54.360 --> 1:00:57.113
I need some food that had parents, man.

1:00:57.196 --> 1:00:58.614
- You know what I mean?
- Uh-huh.

1:00:58.698 --> 1:01:00.575
Give me some cow up in there.

1:01:00.658 --> 1:01:03.077
You know what I'm saying?
Some ribs, something.

1:01:09.584 --> 1:01:11.586
- Right.
- Chicken fried chicken.

1:01:12.378 --> 1:01:13.713
I'll come through, though.

1:01:24.223 --> 1:01:27.852
Um...
you know, I heard about Wood and Nina.

1:01:28.478 --> 1:01:30.188
Oh, yeah.

1:01:30.813 --> 1:01:32.065
Figured you had.

1:01:33.691 --> 1:01:35.276
Just be cool, okay?

1:01:36.444 --> 1:01:39.322
Always, girl. I ain't trippin' now.

1:01:55.129 --> 1:01:56.464
What's up, D?

1:01:57.256 --> 1:01:58.674
What's up, Wood?

1:02:03.888 --> 1:02:05.515
So what you been up to, man?

1:02:05.598 --> 1:02:08.393
You know. Just putting in work, man.

1:02:08.476 --> 1:02:10.520
- Really?
- Really.

1:02:10.603 --> 1:02:13.940
See, I got this new gig, keeps me up.

1:02:14.023 --> 1:02:15.858
Working all through the night.

1:02:15.942 --> 1:02:17.568
The late shift.

1:02:17.652 --> 1:02:20.363
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1:02:20.446 --> 1:02:23.157
- I know all about that kind of job.
- Mm-hmm.

1:02:23.241 --> 1:02:24.909
Used to work the hell out of it.

1:02:27.787 --> 1:02:29.163
You sure you can hang with it?

1:02:32.208 --> 1:02:34.752
I tell you,
I hate when this happens, you know?

1:02:37.588 --> 1:02:39.090
I think so.

1:02:39.674 --> 1:02:42.093
Moms keep on paging you, huh?

1:02:42.176 --> 1:02:44.762
- Not this time, D.
- Mmm.

1:02:44.846 --> 1:02:48.599
Well, we all know that you ain't too
good at staying employed, though.

1:02:49.600 --> 1:02:51.018
This might be different.

1:02:51.102 --> 1:02:53.396
You know, and, uh, as I heard it,

1:02:53.479 --> 1:02:57.066
you ain't too good
at staying employed either, partner.

1:02:57.775 --> 1:03:02.864
Well, you see, the difference is,
I usually quit my job.

1:03:02.947 --> 1:03:06.576
You? You usually wind up fired.

1:03:07.368 --> 1:03:09.036
But it's okay.

1:03:09.620 --> 1:03:10.830
You can't help it.

1:03:11.956 --> 1:03:14.542
Yo, Sheila, I'ma talk to you later.
Yeah.

1:03:18.921 --> 1:03:20.840
- Take it easy, Darius.
- Whatever.

1:03:20.923 --> 1:03:23.759
He a trip, ain't he?

1:03:24.635 --> 1:03:26.179
Can't believe that boy.

1:03:26.262 --> 1:03:29.348
Aren't you a little old
to be fighting over some babe?

1:03:29.432 --> 1:03:30.933
You ain't never too old.

1:03:31.017 --> 1:03:34.061
Besides, I can't help it
if I'm the chosen one.

1:03:34.145 --> 1:03:37.273
Oh, okay, I get it. So it's
your turn to hit the skins, right?

1:03:37.356 --> 1:03:42.278
Damn, Sheila. Look, why does it
have to be about sex all the time?

1:03:42.361 --> 1:03:43.738
I really like this girl.

1:03:44.322 --> 1:03:48.409
Okay, we went out, we kicked it. Dinner.
Everything is smooth.

1:03:48.493 --> 1:03:52.413
It's so convenient for women to think
that all we wanna do is bone.

1:03:52.497 --> 1:03:55.374
But sometimes a man
just wanna be held, you know.

1:03:55.458 --> 1:03:57.001
Cuddled a little bit.

1:03:57.627 --> 1:04:01.672
"Hold my back, I'll rub yours."
You know? A little massage or something.

1:04:01.756 --> 1:04:04.926
What's wrong with that? Ain't you
progressive enough to understand?

1:04:05.009 --> 1:04:06.594
Nigga, I got your progressive.

1:04:06.677 --> 1:04:08.888
You a trip.
You know, you need a massage.

1:04:30.785 --> 1:04:32.245
Hey, baby.

1:04:35.206 --> 1:04:37.667
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Tracey Powell.

1:04:37.750 --> 1:04:41.254
Tracey Powell, this is a very,
very good friend of mine, Sheila Downes.

1:04:42.004 --> 1:04:43.005
How you doin'?

1:04:43.089 --> 1:04:44.298
Hi.

1:04:44.882 --> 1:04:46.676
Come on in. Make yourself comfortable.

1:04:46.759 --> 1:04:48.886
Food's in the dining room,
beer's in the fridge.

1:04:49.387 --> 1:04:50.513
Thank you.

1:04:55.434 --> 1:04:58.479
There's a lot of special things going on
when you ride around in this.

1:04:58.563 --> 1:05:02.024
Like for instance, you know, on a Sunday,
I always go through all the lights.

1:05:02.108 --> 1:05:04.860
Don't nobody stop me.

1:05:04.944 --> 1:05:07.488
There's some benefits to this car.
I'm telling you.

1:05:07.572 --> 1:05:11.701
For instance, when I wanna go to church,
I always get up front. Every time.

1:05:11.784 --> 1:05:14.054
Yeah, because they probably think
you going to a damn funeral.

1:05:14.078 --> 1:05:17.456
That's what I'm saying, but I ain't.
I'm just rolling.

1:05:17.540 --> 1:05:19.292
Who's your friend, man?

1:05:19.375 --> 1:05:20.793
- Tracey?
- Yeah.

1:05:20.876 --> 1:05:24.171
Oh, she teaches the class next to mine.
English. Yeah.

1:05:24.255 --> 1:05:25.631
- English.
- Mm-hmm.

1:05:28.509 --> 1:05:30.928
What? What? I work with her.

1:05:31.012 --> 1:05:33.931
"I work with her." Okay.

1:05:34.015 --> 1:05:36.475
Darius, she isn't my girlfriend
or anything. I work with her.

1:05:38.769 --> 1:05:39.895
All right.

1:05:39.979 --> 1:05:40.980
What?

1:05:42.565 --> 1:05:44.442
Come on, man. You know what.

1:05:44.525 --> 1:05:45.901
I mean, you married.

1:05:46.694 --> 1:05:48.696
What are you,
the fucking Moral Majority now?

1:05:48.779 --> 1:05:51.282
- No, I'm just saying —
- What's this about?

1:05:51.365 --> 1:05:53.034
I mean, Troy's a good woman.

1:05:53.117 --> 1:05:55.470
If my memory serves me correctly, you were
the one who told me not to get married.

1:05:55.494 --> 1:05:57.246
All of y'all told me not get married.

1:05:57.330 --> 1:06:00.041
- Who? I said that?
- Yeah, you. Don't be saying who. You.

1:06:00.750 --> 1:06:03.919
Damn, I did say that. But I also said
the Commodores would get back together.

1:06:04.003 --> 1:06:06.672
- I mean, who knew, man?
- Look, man. Let me tell you something.

1:06:06.756 --> 1:06:09.258
People grow apart, right?

1:06:09.342 --> 1:06:10.509
People change.

1:06:10.593 --> 1:06:12.928
But, see, you wouldn't know
anything about that.

1:06:13.012 --> 1:06:16.140
- What you talking about? Yes, I would.
- No, you wouldn't, Darius.

1:06:16.223 --> 1:06:19.602
Because the last relationship you been in
that lasted longer six months, my brother,

1:06:19.685 --> 1:06:22.855
was — was, um... was never.

1:06:22.938 --> 1:06:25.066
- Are you ki — Felicia.
- Ne —

1:06:25.149 --> 1:06:26.400
- Felicia, yes, Felicia.
- Ne —

1:06:26.484 --> 1:06:27.610
All right, Felicia.

1:06:28.653 --> 1:06:33.032
So, I maintain, when you get your wife,
you advise me on mine.

1:06:36.118 --> 1:06:38.579
That's just it — all
y'all running around,

1:06:38.663 --> 1:06:41.207
jumping, hopping, skipping, diving,
falling in love and shit.

1:06:41.290 --> 1:06:44.877
Falling in love ain't shit. Somebody talk
to me, please, about how to stay there.

1:06:45.503 --> 1:06:47.505
Do I love my wife? Hell yes.

1:06:47.588 --> 1:06:49.924
Is she here? Hell no.

1:06:50.883 --> 1:06:52.343
All right, man.

1:06:52.927 --> 1:06:57.807
All right? As far as I'm concerned,
all of y'all can step.

1:07:02.019 --> 1:07:03.104
Hey, man.

1:07:03.854 --> 1:07:06.732
I think you need a hug, Savon.

1:07:06.816 --> 1:07:09.443
So, where are you taking me?

1:07:09.527 --> 1:07:11.570
A little set. You know.

1:07:11.654 --> 1:07:13.072
Whose set?

1:07:13.155 --> 1:07:15.157
Some friends.

1:07:15.241 --> 1:07:16.701
It'll be cool, trust me.

1:07:26.335 --> 1:07:28.337
Go, girl! Go, girl!

1:07:30.047 --> 1:07:31.799
Don't let it go.

1:07:31.882 --> 1:07:32.883
It's gonna come back.

1:07:32.967 --> 1:07:34.635
- It's gone —
- Yo, yo. Wait, wait, wait.

1:07:34.719 --> 1:07:37.096
What about the Slop?
Y'all know how to do the Slop?

1:07:37.179 --> 1:07:39.056
"The Slop"?

1:07:39.140 --> 1:07:40.933
Is this a choir? Yeah, I said "Slop."

1:07:41.016 --> 1:07:42.226
Come on. Do it.

1:07:42.309 --> 1:07:45.229
- I don't know how to do it.
- 'Cause you made that shit up.

1:07:45.312 --> 1:07:47.314
I'm 'bout to go find somebody
who can do the Slop.

1:07:47.398 --> 1:07:48.858
On TV, right?

1:07:48.941 --> 1:07:50.192
No, I got one.

1:07:51.610 --> 1:07:53.779
Yeah, I can do that. Yeah.

1:07:53.863 --> 1:07:55.698
See, my uncle Terry
had to get on his horse.

1:07:55.781 --> 1:07:57.450
There you go.

1:07:59.452 --> 1:08:00.828
What's up, Black people?

1:08:04.999 --> 1:08:08.294
- Where's your bathroom?
- Up the stairs and to the left.

1:08:08.377 --> 1:08:09.754
Thanks.

1:08:17.094 --> 1:08:18.763
So what's up, Ed?

1:08:18.846 --> 1:08:21.182
You are so foul.

1:08:21.265 --> 1:08:22.808
Look —

1:08:22.892 --> 1:08:24.572
You know it's fucked up,
what you're doing.

1:08:24.643 --> 1:08:26.288
- You know that's fucked up.
- Whatever, man.

1:08:26.312 --> 1:08:27.772
- Whatever?
- Don't.

1:08:34.862 --> 1:08:39.575
Ha-ha! I told you I know...
h-how to do the Slop.

1:08:39.658 --> 1:08:42.495
- What's up, D?
- Hey, what's up, man?

1:08:43.287 --> 1:08:45.873
Now I'm starting to see
how the Slop was done.

1:08:45.956 --> 1:08:47.500
- Mama showed you?
- Yeah.

1:08:47.583 --> 1:08:50.169
- True professional.
- Go ahead and break it down, man.

1:08:50.252 --> 1:08:53.297
Nah, I don't wanna
put too much hip into it, you know.

1:08:59.845 --> 1:09:02.014
I need to talk to you outside.

1:09:02.097 --> 1:09:04.225
- Right now?
- Right now.

1:09:09.355 --> 1:09:11.982
Uh, I'll be right back.

1:09:18.989 --> 1:09:20.032
Nina.

1:09:20.908 --> 1:09:21.992
Nina.

1:09:22.076 --> 1:09:23.828
Take me home now.

1:09:23.911 --> 1:09:25.621
Nina, what's wrong?

1:09:25.704 --> 1:09:28.666
You embarrassed the shit out of me
and I don't appreciate it.

1:09:28.749 --> 1:09:32.127
If you and Darius wanna see whose dick
is bigger, you can do it without me.

1:09:32.211 --> 1:09:33.420
Look, I'm sorry.

1:09:33.504 --> 1:09:35.923
Don't say shit to me.
Just get in the car and take me home.

1:09:36.006 --> 1:09:39.343
Like you didn't think for one second
he was gonna be at this party?

1:09:39.426 --> 1:09:41.262
Are you gonna take me home or not?

1:09:42.805 --> 1:09:44.223
Hell no.

1:09:44.306 --> 1:09:46.267
Unbelievable.

1:09:50.437 --> 1:09:51.522
Walk.

1:09:52.523 --> 1:09:54.984
Nah, nah, I —

1:09:56.151 --> 1:09:58.070
Hey, yo, where Nina at?

1:09:59.238 --> 1:10:00.406
I don't know, man.

1:10:02.032 --> 1:10:03.826
You just left the woman outside, Wood?

1:10:09.456 --> 1:10:12.167
What? You got something to say, Sheila,
why don't you just say it?

1:10:12.251 --> 1:10:14.628
I ain't got nothin' to say to you.

1:10:15.588 --> 1:10:18.424
- Nina, slow up.
- I don't wanna talk right now, Darius.

1:10:18.507 --> 1:10:20.509
Hey, if you slow up,
I'll call you a cab.

1:10:20.593 --> 1:10:22.469
- Just leave me alone.
- Man, slow up.

1:10:22.553 --> 1:10:25.556
- What?
- Now first of all, calm down.

1:10:25.639 --> 1:10:29.059
You and I both know you don't wanna be
out here this late by yourself,

1:10:29.143 --> 1:10:32.146
stomping up and down the street like
somebody done stole your fucking bike.

1:10:33.731 --> 1:10:38.068
Now, all I wanna do is try to make sure
you get home safely. That's it. Trust me.

1:10:38.152 --> 1:10:41.655
We gon' walk up to this pay phone
up here, I'll call you a cab,

1:10:41.739 --> 1:10:45.159
I'll wait, you get in and boom,
you can be on your merry way.

1:10:57.338 --> 1:10:58.339
What?

1:10:58.422 --> 1:11:01.050
What the hell you doin',
running around with my boy?

1:11:01.133 --> 1:11:04.720
First you carry your ass off to New York.
Then you come back and don't even call me?

1:11:04.803 --> 1:11:07.389
All you had to do
was tell me you were seeing somebody.

1:11:07.473 --> 1:11:09.159
What are you talking about?
I ain't seeing nobody.

1:11:09.183 --> 1:11:11.810
I saw you at the bookstore with a girl.

1:11:11.894 --> 1:11:13.705
I'm always at the bookstore.
What are you talking about?

1:11:13.729 --> 1:11:15.856
You know what I'm talking about.

1:11:21.779 --> 1:11:24.531
Oh, shit. Lisa. Damn.

1:12:00.317 --> 1:12:01.485
Damn.

1:12:21.005 --> 1:12:22.339
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello?

1:12:23.173 --> 1:12:24.258
Nina?

1:12:24.341 --> 1:12:25.384
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:12:25.884 --> 1:12:27.344
Damn, hey.

1:12:27.886 --> 1:12:31.348
Hey. I just wanted to call and apologize
for the other night.

1:12:31.432 --> 1:12:34.226
I honestly didn't know
you were gonna be there.

1:12:34.309 --> 1:12:37.813
Look, uh, no apology is necessary, okay?

1:12:38.981 --> 1:12:40.232
Darius?

1:12:40.315 --> 1:12:41.358
Yeah?

1:12:41.900 --> 1:12:42.901
<i>I, uh...</i>

1:12:43.694 --> 1:12:48.157
I have two tickets to the VON
stepper set tomorrow night and, uh...

1:12:49.199 --> 1:12:51.785
I was just wondering if you could step?

1:12:57.666 --> 1:12:58.834
Yeah.

1:14:04.775 --> 1:14:07.027
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I didn't know you were that good.

1:14:07.111 --> 1:14:10.280
Yeah, I'm the groove man.
I do my little thing.

1:14:10.364 --> 1:14:14.034
- You didn't know I had it, did you?
- Now that's what I call a real date.

1:14:14.118 --> 1:14:16.954
"A real date"?
What you talking 'bout, "a real date"?

1:14:17.037 --> 1:14:20.165
Are you saying
we've never been on a real date before?

1:14:20.249 --> 1:14:24.878
Baby, bumping and grinding
at the Wild Hare hardly qualifies.

1:14:24.962 --> 1:14:29.675
Oh, well, uh, you seemed to like
all that bumping and grinding.

1:14:36.682 --> 1:14:40.018
You know, I wanted to call you
when I got back from New York.

1:14:41.562 --> 1:14:43.647
But when I saw you with that woman...

1:14:43.730 --> 1:14:45.816
- I know, I know.
- ...I didn't know what to think.

1:14:45.899 --> 1:14:49.194
Look, that was absolutely nothing.

1:14:49.278 --> 1:14:51.196
Trust me. It was — It was nothing.

1:14:56.368 --> 1:14:59.371
Sometimes I just wonder
if I'm going too far with you.

1:15:00.831 --> 1:15:03.667
Well, there's no such place.

1:15:03.750 --> 1:15:05.544
This is a destiny-type thing, babe.

1:15:07.045 --> 1:15:10.841
- What am I gonna do with you?
- Oh, I got a few ideas.

1:15:10.924 --> 1:15:14.386
But, uh, tell me
what you got in mind, huh?

1:15:15.846 --> 1:15:18.932
Fountain? What's up? What you got?
What you wanna do?

1:15:23.270 --> 1:15:24.897
- This is a joke, right?
- No.

1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:27.274
It's — It's not a joke.

1:15:28.275 --> 1:15:31.778
W-What's with the pillow with
the blanket? What's all that?

1:15:31.862 --> 1:15:36.408
I know, I know, it's a little bit
awkward, but I was thinking that, um —

1:15:36.491 --> 1:15:40.495
Well, I don't know, we had such —
We had a perfect date and I just —

1:15:40.579 --> 1:15:44.291
I just wanted to feel like I was
saving something for later.

1:15:45.667 --> 1:15:47.753
Saving something for later?

1:15:47.836 --> 1:15:51.048
Baby, you ain't gotta save mine for later.
I'd rather have it right now anyway.

1:15:51.131 --> 1:15:54.718
Nina, we've already done it before.
I mean, we done already repeatedly —

1:15:54.801 --> 1:15:56.178
So what's with the couch?

1:15:56.261 --> 1:15:58.222
Don't be like that.

1:15:58.305 --> 1:16:00.432
Come on. Don't do this to me.

1:16:00.515 --> 1:16:02.559
I mean, it's gonna be cold out here.

1:16:04.561 --> 1:16:05.979
You'll be fine.

1:16:06.730 --> 1:16:07.856
All right, cool.

1:16:08.774 --> 1:16:10.776
You right. I'll be fine.

1:16:10.859 --> 1:16:12.319
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1:16:15.239 --> 1:16:16.990
- Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

1:16:18.825 --> 1:16:22.287
Do you think you could just help me
with the zipper?

1:16:22.371 --> 1:16:23.932
- 'Cause sometimes it gets stuck.
- Yeah, yeah.

1:16:23.956 --> 1:16:25.082
See, now you playing.

1:16:25.165 --> 1:16:29.294
See, all we gotta do is just go upstairs
and I can take off all your clothes.

1:16:29.962 --> 1:16:31.380
Thank you.

1:16:35.926 --> 1:16:37.594
You know you ain't gotta do this, right?

1:16:44.518 --> 1:16:46.561
I don't know why you playing like that.

1:16:46.645 --> 1:16:48.855
Good night.

1:16:51.316 --> 1:16:52.567
Good night.

1:16:52.651 --> 1:16:55.946
It's gonna be mighty cold down here.

1:16:56.029 --> 1:16:57.948
Mind turning up the heat?

1:16:59.032 --> 1:17:00.450
She's wrong, man.

1:17:00.534 --> 1:17:02.536
Jesus.

1:17:11.169 --> 1:17:12.170
Shit.

1:17:39.740 --> 1:17:41.074
Can you feel the heat?

1:17:41.158 --> 1:17:42.951
No, not yet.

1:17:43.035 --> 1:17:46.246
Ooh, shit, I can.

1:18:44.513 --> 1:18:45.680
Hey, Nina.

1:18:45.764 --> 1:18:47.307
Yeah?

1:18:51.895 --> 1:18:54.398
you mind if I play something for you?

1:18:56.274 --> 1:18:58.985
N-No. Not at all.

1:20:48.386 --> 1:20:50.514
Yes,
I know this is a Black neighborhood.

1:20:51.681 --> 1:20:55.018
Well, send somebody down
who can handle themselves, man.

1:20:55.685 --> 1:20:58.313
You know, you guys are terrible.

1:20:59.231 --> 1:21:00.941
All I want is my mail.

1:21:01.024 --> 1:21:03.443
Look, don't — don't put me on hold.

1:21:06.071 --> 1:21:07.656
What's wrong with you?

1:21:08.156 --> 1:21:10.242
No, no, no, no —

1:21:10.325 --> 1:21:12.702
They had me on hold.

1:21:14.454 --> 1:21:15.747
What's wrong?

1:21:21.378 --> 1:21:22.837
Hello. How you doing?

1:21:22.921 --> 1:21:24.130
Hi.

1:21:46.194 --> 1:21:47.404
Yeah?

1:21:50.448 --> 1:21:51.658
Lisa?

1:21:53.618 --> 1:21:55.662
Do you know what time it is?

1:21:58.790 --> 1:22:00.125
Why you calling?

1:22:01.710 --> 1:22:04.254
I told you not to call me.

1:22:15.765 --> 1:22:17.183
Want a beer?

1:22:41.333 --> 1:22:43.585
<i>Do you think I slept with Wood?</i>

1:22:52.469 --> 1:22:55.472
Well, I learned a long time ago
not to ask a question

1:22:55.555 --> 1:22:57.599
I didn't wanna know the answer to.

1:22:59.184 --> 1:23:01.061
- Why don't you wanna know?
- 'Cause I don't.

1:23:01.144 --> 1:23:03.438
- Why?
- You wrecking my flow, okay.

1:23:06.274 --> 1:23:08.276
Excuse the fuck outta me.

1:23:11.279 --> 1:23:14.449
Well, I didn't.
Wrecking your fucking flow.

1:23:35.929 --> 1:23:38.056
Take off your clothes.

1:23:40.684 --> 1:23:42.852
Quit playing.

1:23:42.936 --> 1:23:44.145
Who's playing?

1:23:48.650 --> 1:23:50.151
What's the matter?

1:23:51.736 --> 1:23:53.780
I've already seen what you got.

1:23:53.863 --> 1:23:55.949
Will you stop? What are you doing?

1:23:56.032 --> 1:23:57.784
You don't trust me?

1:23:57.867 --> 1:23:59.119
No, I don't.

1:24:03.498 --> 1:24:05.166
- You don't?
- No.

1:24:10.755 --> 1:24:12.132
This is about Lisa, isn't it?

1:24:14.926 --> 1:24:17.595
I can't believe you, man.

1:24:17.679 --> 1:24:20.765
You still on that Lisa shit.
That amazes me.

1:24:21.516 --> 1:24:24.602
Look...

1:24:26.855 --> 1:24:30.275
We've talked about this a thousand times
and I explained to you.

1:24:31.693 --> 1:24:34.279
She and I are over.
That is history. The past.

1:24:34.362 --> 1:24:35.447
Okay?

1:24:35.530 --> 1:24:37.991
We're together. So tell me,
what is your fucking problem?

1:24:38.074 --> 1:24:39.874
- How am I supposed to know that?
- Know what?

1:24:39.951 --> 1:24:43.580
- That you're not still seeing her.
- 'Cause I just told you for the last time.

1:24:43.663 --> 1:24:45.206
Well, that's not enough, Darius,

1:24:45.290 --> 1:24:49.586
because you have not given me any reason
to trust anything that you say.

1:24:50.754 --> 1:24:52.213
W-What are you talking about?

1:24:52.297 --> 1:24:55.175
I'm talking about the blackboard
with her number on it,

1:24:55.258 --> 1:24:58.887
the phone calls at 5:00 a.m.,
trying to read your mind every day.

1:24:58.970 --> 1:25:02.682
You don't know shit about trust.
Okay? You don't.

1:25:02.766 --> 1:25:05.769
You the one who went to New York
and fucked old boy.

1:25:05.852 --> 1:25:09.272
Came back here and hung out
with my boys, partying and shit.

1:25:09.355 --> 1:25:11.274
What is that?
You wanna talk about trust?

1:25:11.357 --> 1:25:13.517
You acted like you didn't care
that I went to New York.

1:25:15.945 --> 1:25:18.031
This shit is for the birds, man.

1:25:18.114 --> 1:25:21.367
Really, it is. I don't even know
what the fuck you talking —

1:25:21.451 --> 1:25:25.705
Look, you know what?
You can do both of us a real big favor.

1:25:26.372 --> 1:25:29.542
Just come over to my crib
and get your shit.

1:25:29.626 --> 1:25:32.378
Why would you wanna be
with somebody you don't trust?

1:25:32.462 --> 1:25:34.297
Don't gotta deal with this shit.

1:25:56.820 --> 1:25:58.738
I guess that's everything.

1:26:00.740 --> 1:26:03.660
Shut my door all the way
when you leave.

1:26:14.295 --> 1:26:16.631
You get any work done
on that novel, man?

1:26:16.714 --> 1:26:19.008
Not in the mood
to write anything right now.

1:26:20.176 --> 1:26:21.427
Let me ask you a question.

1:26:21.511 --> 1:26:24.264
If you were stranded
on a deserted island

1:26:25.014 --> 1:26:28.935
and could only take one of
your ex girls, who would it be?

1:26:29.018 --> 1:26:32.438
- Shit, I don't know.
- That's the thing, man.

1:26:32.522 --> 1:26:35.024
With the exception of Felicia, man,

1:26:35.108 --> 1:26:38.486
I can't stand to be around any of them
for more than a few hours at a time.

1:26:38.570 --> 1:26:41.865
Ooh, now that's a name
I ain't heard in a while.

1:26:41.948 --> 1:26:44.325
Yep. I messed that up, man.

1:26:45.076 --> 1:26:47.161
Trying to be a motherfucking player.

1:26:49.789 --> 1:26:51.583
I actually loved that girl, man.

1:26:52.750 --> 1:26:54.961
You only get one. Two tops.

1:26:56.296 --> 1:26:57.964
- One what?
- Mmm.

1:26:58.715 --> 1:27:01.301
- True love.
- True love, my ass, man.

1:27:01.384 --> 1:27:04.596
Love is what you make
and with whom you make it.

1:27:04.679 --> 1:27:06.431
That's it.

1:27:07.432 --> 1:27:08.725
Yeah, well...

1:27:10.268 --> 1:27:12.061
I think I messed up twice.

1:27:13.771 --> 1:27:17.483
You'd think by now I'd have
a little more insight, man, but...

1:27:18.860 --> 1:27:21.279
I don't know, man.
I don't know what to think.

1:27:21.362 --> 1:27:23.990
That, my friend,
is your problem right there.

1:27:24.657 --> 1:27:26.242
Physics, this shit ain't.

1:27:26.951 --> 1:27:28.995
It ain't supposed to make sense.

1:27:29.078 --> 1:27:32.832
Love, passion, it is what it is.

1:28:46.447 --> 1:28:48.700
Savon, you and your wife both love to--

1:28:48.783 --> 1:28:50.503
- See, that's my joker.
- Can I get my book?

1:28:50.576 --> 1:28:52.245
- No.
- Thank you.

1:28:52.328 --> 1:28:54.706
Y'all both cheaters, man.

1:28:54.789 --> 1:28:57.208
- Hey, give me my book.
- Speak to me.

1:28:57.291 --> 1:28:59.627
<i>Darius, it's Josie.</i>

1:28:59.711 --> 1:29:01.546
Oh, hey. What's happening?

1:29:01.629 --> 1:29:07.760
<i>Look, um, Nina told me
not to tell anyone this, but... fuck it.</i>

1:29:07.844 --> 1:29:10.304
- What is it?
<i>- I thought you should know.</i>

1:29:10.847 --> 1:29:14.517
<i>She did a shoot for</i> Vibe <i>magazine</i>
<i>and it worked out really well.</i>

1:29:15.435 --> 1:29:16.436
Well, good for her.

1:29:17.061 --> 1:29:19.313
<i>- And since you--</i>
- Look, why you calling me anyway?

1:29:19.397 --> 1:29:24.485
<i>Look, she's on the noon train tomorrow.
I thought maybe you should see her off.</i>

1:29:25.153 --> 1:29:27.905
- Well, maybe not.
<i>- Well, you do what you wanna do.</i>

1:29:27.989 --> 1:29:29.657
<i>I just thought I should tell you.</i>

1:29:29.741 --> 1:29:31.617
Yeah, well, thanks for your concern.

1:29:34.412 --> 1:29:36.039
- Stop.
- You can't play.

1:29:38.374 --> 1:29:39.876
Hey, Darius, who was that?

1:31:31.529 --> 1:31:33.156
Shit.

1:31:41.247 --> 1:31:42.665
All aboard!

1:31:51.424 --> 1:31:52.842
What's goin' on?

1:31:58.139 --> 1:32:00.057
Are you all right?

1:32:22.747 --> 1:32:24.165
Nina!

1:33:36.362 --> 1:33:39.573
Very nice.

1:33:42.451 --> 1:33:43.869
Give me that smile.

1:33:43.953 --> 1:33:45.621
There it is.

1:33:49.208 --> 1:33:53.254
Nina, here's your, uh, tickets
and itinerary for the Chicago shoot.

1:33:53.337 --> 1:33:55.506
- Great. Thank you.
- Don't worry about it.

1:34:04.557 --> 1:34:06.726
- There you go.
- All right, cool.

1:34:07.643 --> 1:34:09.895
- Thanks.
- You're very welcome, sir.

1:34:10.479 --> 1:34:13.274
So, let's see this — this masterpiece.

1:34:13.357 --> 1:34:14.525
- Stand back.
- Mm-hmm.

1:34:14.608 --> 1:34:16.652
- You might hurt yourself, bruh.
- Oh.

1:34:19.071 --> 1:34:20.948
That's it right there.

1:34:21.657 --> 1:34:24.660
And you know the book-signing party
is gonna be real nice.

1:34:24.744 --> 1:34:27.747
Oh, sookie sookie sookie, now.

1:34:27.830 --> 1:34:29.540
Man, this...

1:34:29.623 --> 1:34:31.208
That's a jacked-up picture, though.

1:34:31.292 --> 1:34:33.002
Why you gotta talk about the picture,
man?

1:34:33.085 --> 1:34:34.420
Jacked-up picture.

1:34:34.503 --> 1:34:36.422
Why you gotta say something
about my picture?

1:34:36.505 --> 1:34:38.507
Congratulations. Mmm?

1:34:39.175 --> 1:34:41.177
- Thanks.
- I know it's a dream come true.

1:34:44.096 --> 1:34:45.973
And an old one, man.

1:34:46.057 --> 1:34:47.141
An old one.

1:34:47.224 --> 1:34:48.851
That's a nice dedication.

1:34:48.934 --> 1:34:49.935
Yeah.

1:34:54.106 --> 1:34:56.650
So how come, uh —
how come you never called her?

1:34:59.487 --> 1:35:00.696
Well...

1:35:02.365 --> 1:35:04.492
I wrote a bunch of letters, but...

1:35:06.035 --> 1:35:08.162
I thought it made me look like a fool.

1:35:10.623 --> 1:35:12.666
Never mailed any of them off.

1:35:14.752 --> 1:35:16.170
Yeah, well, I —

1:35:16.253 --> 1:35:19.882
I would have paid some mad money to see
your ass running through Union Station.

1:35:19.965 --> 1:35:21.384
Yeah.

1:35:22.927 --> 1:35:25.429
Damn, man.

1:35:27.973 --> 1:35:31.310
Had you not been sucking on them
cancer sticks, you'd have caught her.

1:35:32.311 --> 1:35:33.813
I'm cool, man.

1:36:16.021 --> 1:36:17.982
Excuse me. Can I see that?

1:36:18.065 --> 1:36:19.066
Sure.

1:36:19.567 --> 1:36:20.734
Thanks.

1:36:41.464 --> 1:36:43.591
Next up, our next poet is...

1:36:48.596 --> 1:36:52.183
Our next poet is a virgin to the mic,

1:36:52.266 --> 1:36:55.519
but I'm sure you'll feel her
just the same.

1:36:56.228 --> 1:36:59.607
Sanctuary, welcome Ms. Nina Mosley.

1:37:22.171 --> 1:37:23.380
This is, um...

1:37:26.133 --> 1:37:28.052
something that I've been working on
for a while

1:37:28.135 --> 1:37:32.056
and I was hoping that a certain someone
would be here tonight.

1:37:33.432 --> 1:37:37.144
But I don't see him, so...

1:37:39.104 --> 1:37:41.106
I guess I'm gonna get it out anyway.

1:37:44.276 --> 1:37:46.546
It's funny what you can do
in front of a room full of people

1:37:46.570 --> 1:37:49.573
that you can't even seem to do
in front of one person.

1:37:54.745 --> 1:37:56.997
"It is the color of light,

1:37:58.541 --> 1:38:01.085
the shape of sound
high in the evergreens.

1:38:02.586 --> 1:38:04.922
It lies suspended in hills...

1:38:08.259 --> 1:38:10.386
a blue line in a red sky.

1:38:12.346 --> 1:38:14.139
I am looking at sound.

1:38:17.393 --> 1:38:19.853
I am hearing the brightness

1:38:19.937 --> 1:38:22.231
of high bluffs and almond trees.

1:38:25.484 --> 1:38:31.865
I am tasting the wilderness
of lakes, rivers and streams

1:38:33.576 --> 1:38:36.203
caught in an angle of song.

1:38:39.540 --> 1:38:42.001
I am remembering water

1:38:42.084 --> 1:38:44.545
that glows in the dawn,

1:38:45.754 --> 1:38:48.090
the motion tumbled in earth,

1:38:48.966 --> 1:38:50.926
life hidden in mounds.

1:38:54.638 --> 1:38:56.515
I am dancing...

1:38:58.183 --> 1:39:00.102
a bright beam of light.

1:39:01.937 --> 1:39:06.567
I am remembering love."

1:39:15.451 --> 1:39:18.662
Look, Reg, I'ma gonna talk to you, man.
All right, cool.

1:39:20.748 --> 1:39:22.082
Thanks.

1:39:27.046 --> 1:39:28.922
- Nina Mosley.
- Give it up!

1:39:57.660 --> 1:39:58.660
Nina!

1:40:17.179 --> 1:40:18.847
Long time no see.

1:40:19.848 --> 1:40:21.058
Yeah.

1:40:28.649 --> 1:40:31.026
I, uh, enjoyed your poem up there.

1:40:41.036 --> 1:40:45.165
Look, I know that
there's been a lot of mistakes,

1:40:45.249 --> 1:40:47.292
and we both made 'em.

1:40:47.376 --> 1:40:49.753
I apologize for my part in that.

1:40:51.255 --> 1:40:55.926
And all that — that nonsense in the past,
I don't give a shit about that anymore.

1:40:58.429 --> 1:41:00.139
I never stopped thinking about you.

1:41:01.598 --> 1:41:03.350
I want us to be together again.

1:41:04.852 --> 1:41:07.479
For — For as long as we can be.

1:41:08.939 --> 1:41:11.608
As usual, your timing couldn't be worse.

1:41:13.944 --> 1:41:17.156
You always want what you want
when you want it.

1:41:17.239 --> 1:41:19.783
Why is everything so urgent with you?

1:41:19.867 --> 1:41:21.410
Let me tell you something.

1:41:22.494 --> 1:41:24.830
This here, right now,

1:41:24.913 --> 1:41:27.583
at this very moment
is all that matters to me.

1:41:29.793 --> 1:41:31.462
I love you.

1:41:34.715 --> 1:41:36.925
That's urgent like a motherfucker.

1:41:43.307 --> 1:41:44.516
Yeah.

1:41:47.060 --> 1:41:48.771
- How do we do this?
- I don't know.

1:41:48.854 --> 1:41:50.294
- I live in New York.
- I don't care.

1:41:53.066 --> 1:41:54.651
All right, so...

1:41:55.736 --> 1:41:57.529
what's the first step?

1:41:59.156 --> 1:42:00.824
We can start by
getting out of this rain.

1:42:00.908 --> 1:42:03.452
Ooh, yes.

1:42:20.219 --> 1:42:21.970
I love you.
