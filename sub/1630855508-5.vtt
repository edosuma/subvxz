have laughed at you,

16:27.695 --> 16:30.781
but why were you doing
that tortoise thing?

16:30.781 --> 16:33.242
- Not every religious person is
the same amount of religious.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.493
You have a Christmas tree.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.494
Do you go to mass
on Good Friday?

16:35.494 --> 16:36.746
No.

working and how

16:44.837 --> 16:45.922
is there this much soup?

16:45.922 --> 16:46.964
- We love soup.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.633
What, is that weird too?

16:48.633 --> 16:50.760
- Actually, New York has
several restaurants that--

about New York.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.514

Hello, everyone.

I'm Petey.

17:26.587 --> 17:30.132
But I want to ask you all,
what isn't weird?

17:30.132 --> 17:32.885
If you think about it,
even normal weddings are weird.

Throwing rice at people's hair.

17:43.479 --> 17:47.525

for another full meal.

17:47.525 --> 17:48.734
That's weird.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.194
And marriage is weird.

17:50.194 --> 17:51.654
[laughter]

17:51.654 --> 17:53.406
Promising the rest
of your life to someone?

17:53.406 --> 17:54.991
That makes no sense.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.951
But that's what traditions are.

17:56.951 --> 17:59.328
They're doing
something that makes no sense

17:59.328 --> 18:02.415
with the people you love
because you love them.

18:02.415 --> 18:05.084

18:05.084 --> 18:06.711

of something,

18:06.711 --> 18:08.588

a line dance

18:08.588 --> 18:09.964

18:09.964 --> 18:10.923
- Tortoise.
[laughter]

18:10.923 --> 18:12.091
- Thank you.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.134
Anyway, the point is,

18:13.134 --> 18:14.760
it's not about what you do.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.679
It's about who you do it with.

but so am I.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.444
And the only thing
better than one wackadoo

18:31.444 --> 18:34.155
