01:17.202 --> 01:20.483
# Listen to what I say
# To what I say

01:20.534 --> 01:23.734
# Do you believe I would take something
with me

01:24.534 --> 01:27.154
# And give it to the policeman?

01:27.202 --> 01:29.487
# I wouldn't do that

01:30.701 --> 01:32.360
# And if I do that, I would say

01:32.409 --> 01:35.775
# Sir, come on
and put the charge on me

01:36.785 --> 01:38.859
# I wouldn't do that

01:38.910 --> 01:40.865
# No, I wouldn't do that

01:41.868 --> 01:42.863
# Huh

01:42.910 --> 01:45.233
# I'm not a fool to hurt myself

01:46.035 --> 01:49.400
# So I was innocent of what they done to me

01:49.451 --> 01:51.027
# They was wrong

01:51.076 --> 01:54.406
# Ah, listen to me one more time,
they were wrong, huh

01:54.451 --> 01:55.648
# Oh, yeah

# Right now,

04:28.326 --> 04:30.862
<i>...they think it's attractive</i>

04:30.910 --> 04:32.947
<i>to offer to the young</i>

04:32.993 --> 04:38.065
<i>a future wholly controlled
by the operation of the socialist state...</i>

05:32.993 --> 05:35.150
...two days for me, I think.
- Next Tuesday?

05:35.201 --> 05:36.398
Yeah.

05:37.201 --> 05:39.488
Wa-hey, nice flares, matey!

05:39.535 --> 05:40.944
Piss off.

05:56.077 --> 05:59.193
- Are you gonna buy that?
- Yeah. Yeah, one sec, mate.

05:59.243 --> 06:00.866
Come on. Bring it over.

06:02.451 --> 06:04.442
Just give me a minute.

06:08.993 --> 06:10.699
I'll just check...

06:10.743 --> 06:14.190
- It's not a library, you know.
- I was fricking reading that.

06:14.243 --> 06:17.359
- You what?
- I said, I was fricking reading it.

06:17.409 --> 06:19.033
- Just go.
- What?

06:19.077 --> 06:20.486
Just go.

06:20.535 --> 06:22.157
What about my Cola Cubes?

06:22.201 --> 06:24.441
You're not gonna get any.
Now, just go, all right?

06:24.493 --> 06:25.772
Cola Cubes.

06:25.827 --> 06:28.397
I know who you are
and I know your mum. Go. Now.

06:28.451 --> 06:30.241
- Cola Cubes.
- Are you gonna go or not?

06:30.284 --> 06:32.690
- No.
- Right, OK, I'll call the police.

06:32.743 --> 06:35.066
- Go on, then.
- I mean it, I'm gonna call 'em.

06:35.117 --> 06:37.488
- Go on, then.
- I mean it.

06:37.535 --> 06:40.071
- Go on, then.
- We'll see.

06:40.117 --> 06:41.741
All right. I'm going.

06:41.785 --> 06:43.657
Oh, and you're banned.

06:43.701 --> 06:45.775
Oh, and you're a mong.

06:48.701 --> 06:50.277
Hey, see you, Janice!

06:53.035 --> 06:54.741
Oh, God, what a loser.

07:01.409 --> 07:03.281
Loser!

07:13.451 --> 07:14.992
- Look at that twat.
- There?

07:15.701 --> 07:19.316
Fucking hell, look at them flares. Goof!

07:20.993 --> 07:21.774
Goofy.

07:21.827 --> 07:24.065
Oi, oi.

07:24.118 --> 07:25.492
Talking to me?

07:25.535 --> 07:26.529
What?

07:26.576 --> 07:28.199
Never knew Keith Chegwin had a son.

07:28.243 --> 07:29.652
Piss off.

07:29.701 --> 07:32.984
- What the fuck are they?
- These? I'm wearing 'em for a bet.

07:33.035 --> 07:35.191
- What's your excuse?
- Cheeky bastard.

07:35.243 --> 07:37.233
- Woodstock's that way, pal.
- Fuck off.

07:37.284 --> 07:39.358
At least I don't look like Count Dracula.

07:39.410 --> 07:42.775
- Think you're funny, you little spaz?
- Yeah. Yeah.

07:42.827 --> 07:45.279
- Wanna hear a fucking joke, yeah?
- Yeah, go on, then.

07:45.326 --> 07:47.233
How many people can you fit in a Mini?

07:47.284 --> 07:48.694
I don't fucking know.

07:48.743 --> 07:50.533
Three in the back, two in the front

07:50.576 --> 07:52.484
and your fucking dad in the ashtray.

07:52.535 --> 07:54.241
You fucker!

07:59.410 --> 08:01.614
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

08:02.618 --> 08:05.236
- I'll fucking murder you.
- Get off!

08:07.827 --> 08:09.402
- You fucking...
- Get up!

08:09.451 --> 08:10.861
- Fucking...
- Shut up!

08:10.910 --> 08:13.694
You fucking bastard.
What the fuck are you bothered about?

08:13.743 --> 08:15.152
You fucking...

08:15.201 --> 08:18.401
Do not use that language.
Headmaster's office now.

08:19.410 --> 08:22.028
I'm fed up with you.

08:26.410 --> 08:27.784
Argh.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.069
Aargh!

08:32.118 --> 08:33.611
Argh!

08:46.702 --> 08:49.024
There's a disco today, Harvey.

08:49.076 --> 08:50.783
But you won't be going.

08:50.827 --> 08:52.283
Now get out!

08:56.326 --> 08:57.903
Come in, Field.

09:05.868 --> 09:07.610
Tainted Love

09:09.493 --> 09:14.031
# For I toss and turn
I can't sleep at night...

09:20.910 --> 09:25.733
# This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy...

09:25.785 --> 09:27.361
it's gotta be smoother.

09:27.410 --> 09:29.400
- Make it smooth.
- That's nice.

09:29.451 --> 09:31.241
That were nice. Oh, yeah.

09:31.284 --> 09:34.282
- Now we got a rhythm going.
- Piss off. I just wanna light my fag.

09:34.326 --> 09:35.819
For God's sake.

09:37.368 --> 09:38.861
- All right, mate?
- All right.

09:38.910 --> 09:40.699
'Ey up, what's the matter?

09:40.743 --> 09:41.738
Nothing.

09:41.785 --> 09:45.232
What's with t'face ache?
You look upset. What's to do?

09:45.285 --> 09:47.690
It's people picking on me,
taking the mick out of me.

09:47.743 --> 09:50.694
Oh, mate, you're breaking my heart.
Sit down for five minutes.

09:50.743 --> 09:52.734
- Why?
- Woody, look at them flares.

09:52.785 --> 09:55.355
See what I mean?
That's what I fucking mean, there.

09:55.410 --> 09:58.692
You can see he's upset.
Will you behave with the flare comments?

09:58.743 --> 10:00.734
- They're bad...
- Come on. Five minutes.

10:00.785 --> 10:03.783
- Just come and sit down, mate.
- But you'll all just pick on me.

10:03.827 --> 10:06.362
- Everyone does.
- Oh, come and sit down, mate.

10:06.410 --> 10:08.945
I feel bloody sorry for you.
Just five minutes.

10:08.993 --> 10:11.482
Just give me five minutes
to make you feel better.

10:11.535 --> 10:14.865
Come on, mate. Bloody hell!
It can't be that bad, eh?

10:15.868 --> 10:18.238
So what's this?
Who's picking on you, lad?

10:18.285 --> 10:20.192
Some lad at school.

10:20.243 --> 10:22.732
- What's his name?
- Harvey.

10:22.785 --> 10:23.780
Harvey?

10:25.410 --> 10:27.980
What sort of a bloody girl's name
is Harvey?

10:28.034 --> 10:31.365
Hello. I'm Harvey.
And I've come to give you gyp.

10:32.410 --> 10:34.815
I've got one of these for you,
Sonny Jim.

10:34.867 --> 10:37.984
I've got one of those for you.
My name is Harvey.

10:38.034 --> 10:40.321
You're drawing a fine line.

10:41.410 --> 10:43.400
You're drawing a fine line. Eh?

10:43.451 --> 10:44.779
Bloody hell!

10:45.785 --> 10:48.355
- Where the frig have you been?
- Bloody Ada!

10:48.410 --> 10:50.566
Took me an hour
to get someone to go in for me.

10:50.618 --> 10:53.652
You had to wait a bloody hour for that pie?
Give me that shit.

10:53.702 --> 10:55.075
For God's sake.

10:55.118 --> 10:57.607
- Who the fuck's he?
- What is your name?

10:57.660 --> 10:59.152
I'm Shaun.

10:59.201 --> 11:01.192
Shaun, I'm Woody, mate.
Nice to meet you.

11:01.243 --> 11:02.984
That there's Milky, my main man.

11:03.034 --> 11:05.191
Pukey's a nutcase. Don't wind him up.

11:05.243 --> 11:07.150
That's Kez. He's pretty chilled out.

11:07.201 --> 11:10.781
And this fat idiot's Gadget.

11:12.451 --> 11:14.193
You are, Gadget, you are.

11:14.243 --> 11:16.483
Anyway, Shaun, move.
You're in my seat.

11:16.535 --> 11:17.732
What?

11:17.785 --> 11:19.028
Move.

11:19.076 --> 11:22.074
Gadget, mate, out of all the places to sit,
you want to sit there?

11:22.118 --> 11:23.741
- Yeah, I do.
Shall I move?

11:23.785 --> 11:26.238
What are you asking him for?
Move, now.

11:26.285 --> 11:29.033
- He don't have to bloody move.
- Fucking does. Get out.

11:29.076 --> 11:32.240
Oi, it's a free country.
You sit there if you want to sit there.

11:32.285 --> 11:34.855
- Have you seen these?
- Woody, tell him.

11:34.909 --> 11:36.450
Woody, tell 'em.

11:36.493 --> 11:37.866
Get the fuck...

11:37.909 --> 11:39.367
Calm down.

11:39.410 --> 11:41.365
Will you just calm down?

11:41.410 --> 11:43.862
Fucking behave.
You need to learn when to chill out.

11:43.909 --> 11:44.939
What...?

11:44.993 --> 11:46.783
Get the fuck out of my seat now!

11:46.826 --> 11:49.943
Out of this tunnel
or I'll make your life a living fucking hell.

11:49.993 --> 11:51.783
- Fuck off!
- Fuck out!

11:51.826 --> 11:55.441
- You're a pain in my arse.
- You're all a bunch of bastards!

11:55.493 --> 11:56.985
Oh, fuck off!

11:57.034 --> 11:59.783
You prick!
Shaun, come back, mate.

11:59.826 --> 12:01.533
- Sit down.
- Oh, bloody hell.

12:01.577 --> 12:03.199
Shaun! Sh...

12:03.243 --> 12:05.566
Oh, I feel bad. I feel bad now.

12:05.618 --> 12:09.446
Well done, well done. Are you happy with
your fucking pie now, you prick?

12:09.493 --> 12:11.981
You're a frigging bully, Gadget.

12:17.618 --> 12:19.609
<i>see what you can do with this.</i>

12:19.660 --> 12:22.029
<i>What C is a fodder plant...</i>

12:25.118 --> 12:26.907
- Hiya, love.
- Hello.

12:28.076 --> 12:29.865
- You all right?
- Yeah.

12:29.909 --> 12:32.114
Had a good day at school?

12:37.285 --> 12:38.279
Shaun?

12:39.493 --> 12:41.698
What's wrong, love?
Shaun, come here.

12:41.742 --> 12:42.737
What?

12:42.784 --> 12:44.775
Sit down.
I want to have a word with you.

12:44.826 --> 12:46.023
Why?

12:46.076 --> 12:48.067
Please, son, I want to talk to you.

12:49.410 --> 12:50.689
What?

12:50.742 --> 12:52.947
What have you done to your face?

12:52.993 --> 12:54.237
Nothing.

12:54.285 --> 12:57.981
You've got all scratches all over your face.
Have you been fighting?

12:58.034 --> 13:00.072
No, I did it on the way home from school.

13:00.118 --> 13:03.448
You didn't. You're lying to me.
How have you done it?

13:04.993 --> 13:06.700
It was a boy at school.

13:07.909 --> 13:10.196
He made a joke about Dad, so I hit him.

13:10.243 --> 13:11.984
Well, what did he say about Dad?

13:12.034 --> 13:14.155
I don't wanna say it, Mum.
It's disgusting.

13:14.201 --> 13:16.156
Shaun, I want to know what he said.

13:16.201 --> 13:19.532
I've been picked on three times today.

13:19.577 --> 13:21.981
All because of my trousers.

13:22.034 --> 13:23.740
What's wrong with your trousers?

13:23.784 --> 13:25.775
Look at the fucking size of them!

13:25.826 --> 13:28.397
Stop swearing.
There's nothing wrong with them.

13:28.452 --> 13:31.200
- Your dad bought you them.
- They're too big for me!

13:31.243 --> 13:34.609
If you didn't want to wear them,
you should have put your school ones on.

13:34.660 --> 13:37.231
It's non-uniform day, Mum.

13:37.285 --> 13:39.903
What do you want me to do, Shaun?
I don't know what to do.

13:41.034 --> 13:43.358
- We could move away.
- We can't move away.

13:43.410 --> 13:46.775
We're not moving from anywhere.
We live here and we're staying here.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.616
I don't like it here, Mum.

13:49.618 --> 13:52.818
I liked it better when we were with Dad.

13:56.076 --> 13:59.573
Well, I liked it better when we was with Dad,
but Dad's gone now.

15:06.327 --> 15:07.321
Yes!

16:19.035 --> 16:21.191
<i>Mrs Thatcher's visiting The Antrim</i>

16:21.243 --> 16:24.241
<i>very close to two key events
in the War, for the ship.</i>

16:25.243 --> 16:27.198
<i>Just over there,
in the Falklands Sound,</i>

16:27.243 --> 16:31.532
<i>she was hit aft by a 1,000lb bomb,
which, fortunately, didn't explode,</i>

16:31.576 --> 16:33.566
<i>and there, on Fanning Head,</i>

16:33.618 --> 16:38.524
<i>heavy bombardment from The Antrim
took out a key Argentine position.</i>

16:38.576 --> 16:42.819
<i>Like the Army, the Navy is still taking
the threat of another Argentine attack</i>

16:42.868 --> 16:44.278
<i>very seriously...</i>

16:58.492 --> 17:01.408
<i>...as well as these Oerlikon guns,
the destroyer is armed...</i>

17:03.243 --> 17:04.819
<i>...sea slug, sea cat...</i>

17:06.410 --> 17:08.032
What the fuck?

17:14.076 --> 17:17.240
What do you want, Gadget?
You've just nearly put my window through.

17:17.285 --> 17:20.318
Woody wants to know
if you're coming hunting.

17:21.492 --> 17:23.282
Hunting? Why?

17:23.327 --> 17:26.443
Because he feels sorry
for what happened the other day.

17:26.492 --> 17:29.064
And he just wants to know
if you're coming out.

17:29.118 --> 17:32.732
If I come, you're just gonna kick my head in
in the middle of a field.

17:32.784 --> 17:36.861
Woody said if I come within five feet of you,
he's gonna kick the shit out of me.

17:36.910 --> 17:39.445
And why on earth
are you dressed like that?

17:39.493 --> 17:41.365
We always dress like this.

17:41.410 --> 17:43.068
You look stupid.

17:44.327 --> 17:46.649
I know, but it's just a laugh that we have.

17:46.701 --> 17:48.857
I've got you some stuff. Come on.

17:48.910 --> 17:52.240
It's not a trick, is it, Gadget?
Woody really wants me to come?

17:52.285 --> 17:54.738
It's no trick, honest. Please?

17:54.784 --> 17:57.404
- All right. I'll be down in a minute.
- Hurry up!

17:58.784 --> 18:01.190
<i>Hurry up, you.
Give me a hand.</i>

18:01.243 --> 18:03.234
- Fuck it.
- Come on, Tubs!

18:03.285 --> 18:06.069
Hurry up,
cos Gadget won't get over it, will he?

18:11.243 --> 18:13.234
- Come on.
- Come on. Get up.

18:13.285 --> 18:15.773
Here you are.
Gadget, have that. Have this.

18:15.826 --> 18:17.817
- Gadget!
- Gadget, have this.

18:17.868 --> 18:19.657
I'll have that there, mate.

18:19.701 --> 18:21.242
No, I'm all right.

18:21.285 --> 18:23.276
- Oh, man. Woo!
- I wanted that!

18:23.327 --> 18:25.482
Woo! Woo! Woo-oo!

18:25.534 --> 18:26.909
Come on!

18:29.035 --> 18:31.819
- Where are you going, Gadge?
Whoa-oa-oah!

18:31.868 --> 18:33.361
Woo!

18:33.409 --> 18:34.986
Woo-hoo! Woo!

18:36.243 --> 18:37.819
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

18:49.243 --> 18:51.364
Fuck, yeah! Fucking do it!

18:51.409 --> 18:52.653
Woo!

18:53.659 --> 18:55.069
Woody!

18:55.910 --> 18:58.150
Go on! Fucking do it!

18:58.202 --> 18:59.575
Do it again and again!

18:59.618 --> 19:01.774
- You fucking daft bastard.
- You fat bastard.

19:09.451 --> 19:10.730
Go on!

19:11.743 --> 19:12.738
Hey!

19:19.118 --> 19:20.943
Fucking do it! Do it!

19:20.993 --> 19:22.984
Aah!

19:23.035 --> 19:24.408
Shaun!

19:24.451 --> 19:26.277
Aah!

19:27.409 --> 19:28.784
Come on!

19:28.826 --> 19:31.493
Come on, Shauny! Come on, Shaun!

19:31.534 --> 19:33.111
Come on, Shaun!

19:34.785 --> 19:36.574
Where are we going?

19:36.618 --> 19:38.608
I'll get you a good seat.

19:38.659 --> 19:40.069
Woo!

19:41.035 --> 19:43.072
Get up them stairs.

19:45.826 --> 19:48.113
Shaun! Shaun, Shaun, Shaun!

19:54.409 --> 19:55.819
Quick!

19:57.409 --> 19:59.614
Come on. Quickly. Quickly. Ssh!

20:07.243 --> 20:09.648
Where the fuck have yous gone?
Come on.

20:09.701 --> 20:11.692
I can't be doing with this, lads.

20:11.743 --> 20:13.734
I'm not in the mood for this.

20:14.701 --> 20:16.656
I know yous are in here, I'm not stupid.

20:16.701 --> 20:18.278
So, come out.

20:21.493 --> 20:23.069
Fucker!

20:26.868 --> 20:28.444
Classical!

20:28.493 --> 20:29.820
Classical.

20:29.868 --> 20:32.783
- Classic.
Classic. Classic.

20:32.826 --> 20:35.066
Gold, mate. Liquid gold. Brilliant.

20:35.118 --> 20:37.689
That was classic! Classic, classic.

20:39.035 --> 20:41.653
Oi, oi, oi!
What's all that about, dickhead, eh?

20:41.701 --> 20:43.573
What's the deal with you, eh?

20:43.618 --> 20:45.822
- He shot me.
- I shot you as well.

20:45.868 --> 20:47.030
Come on, Shauny.

20:47.077 --> 20:49.233
- Bloody hell, Gadget.
- What d'you do that for?

20:49.284 --> 20:51.820
Look how yous
have been treating me all day.

20:51.868 --> 20:53.657
I had to carry all the bags.

20:53.701 --> 20:56.272
All of yous running off on me,
hiding on me.

20:56.326 --> 20:59.608
Listen to me. He's a young lad.
He's had a fucking bad week.

20:59.660 --> 21:02.657
So, we're bringing him with us
to show him a bloody good time

21:02.701 --> 21:04.906
and you just backhanded him
round t'head.

21:04.952 --> 21:06.574
I'm disappointed, mate.

21:06.618 --> 21:08.822
You're all favouritising him.

21:08.868 --> 21:11.866
I feel like I've gone down in the ranks
since he's come.

21:11.910 --> 21:13.402
What ranks?

21:13.451 --> 21:16.235
I'm sorry if I've took your place, mate.
I really am.

21:16.284 --> 21:19.864
And if you really want me to go
and give you your spot back, I'll just go.

21:19.910 --> 21:21.900
Don't, mate. Please.

21:21.952 --> 21:24.156
- I'll go. He don't like me.
- No, don't.

21:24.202 --> 21:26.192
He don't know what he's saying.

21:26.242 --> 21:30.236
It's not that I don't like you, mate.
I think you're great. It's just...

21:30.284 --> 21:32.275
I'm having a shitty time and...

21:32.326 --> 21:35.359
- Come on. Shake hands.
- I've been where you are and...

21:35.409 --> 21:39.237
Less of this. It's nonsense, this.
We're mates here. Shake his hand.

21:39.284 --> 21:42.448
Come on. Good lad.
That's what I'm all about. Yeah.

21:42.493 --> 21:45.360
Come here, come here.
Give us a bloody hug, come on.

21:45.409 --> 21:48.491
Bloody hell. Come on, all of yous.
All of yous, get in here.

21:48.534 --> 21:51.024
Bloody hell, my arse!
Who's that on my arse?

21:51.077 --> 21:53.067
Who's that? Calm it down.

21:53.118 --> 21:54.908
Bloody hell, Gadge. Come on, mate.

21:54.952 --> 21:57.321
Morning Sun

21:57.368 --> 22:00.650
# Way out in the morning sun

22:01.493 --> 22:04.491
# There lies my baby,
she was waiting so long

22:04.534 --> 22:06.111
# Aah aah-aah-aah

22:06.160 --> 22:09.359
# Oh, she sing for the sweet melody

22:10.243 --> 22:12.696
# Oh, Lord, I could hear the harmony

22:12.743 --> 22:15.575
# Aah-aah-aah-aah aah-aah-aah...

22:16.660 --> 22:18.650
Wait for me, love.

22:19.660 --> 22:21.282
- I'll see you, chicken.
- See ya.

22:21.326 --> 22:22.523
Them.

22:24.826 --> 22:26.616
- Which ones?
- The big red ones.

22:26.660 --> 22:30.026
Oh, you're not having them, sweetheart.
Look at the size of 'em.

22:30.077 --> 22:32.067
Oh, come on, Mum. You said.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.820
No, Shaun, they look like thug boots.
They're awful.

22:34.868 --> 22:36.444
Come on, Mum. You promised me.

22:36.493 --> 22:39.242
Why don't you get some of them
that you've got in blue?

22:39.284 --> 22:43.360
Cos I don't like these. I want them ones,
Mum. Come on. You promised.

22:43.409 --> 22:46.324
- They'll rub on your shin.
- They'll only be about that.

22:46.368 --> 22:48.358
Be better in my size.

22:48.409 --> 22:50.400
Come on. Where is she?

22:50.451 --> 22:52.655
- Right.
- Well, that was nice timing.

22:52.701 --> 22:54.277
I spoke too soon.

22:54.326 --> 22:57.906
I hurt my shoulder back there.
Been ferreting about for ages.

22:57.952 --> 23:00.985
- Are you all right, love?
- Pulled something in my shoulder.

23:01.035 --> 23:03.605
Now, then, if I can just have that for a second...

23:03.660 --> 23:06.195
- Let me have that, sweetheart.
- I want to hold it.

23:06.243 --> 23:08.696
I'll just have that. Mum, shall I just...?

23:08.743 --> 23:10.781
- Yeah.
- I'll just put that down there.

23:10.827 --> 23:13.990
Ducky, darling, the ones
that you're looking at, these boots...

23:14.035 --> 23:16.026
- Yeah?
... now, they're adult sizes

23:16.077 --> 23:18.113
and you're a size four.

23:18.159 --> 23:21.608
But these have just come in from London.

23:22.618 --> 23:24.158
Are you ready for these?

23:25.159 --> 23:27.280
These are fantastic.

23:27.326 --> 23:29.815
- What the...?
- Oh, look at them, Shaun.

23:29.868 --> 23:31.823
They're absolutely lovely.

23:31.868 --> 23:34.190
- Do you want to hold one? There.
- Oh, my God.

23:34.243 --> 23:36.814
- They're nice, aren't they?
- They're lovely, them.

23:36.868 --> 23:38.277
Oh, they look lovely.

23:38.326 --> 23:40.613
- Try 'em on.
- Where's the "Doc Marten" sign?

23:40.660 --> 23:43.492
These ones, cos they're special
and they're from London,

23:43.535 --> 23:47.031
they don't have the Doc Marten sign
on these - they're too special for that.

23:47.076 --> 23:51.283
- It says "Tompkins" in it.
- The ones from London say Tompkins.

23:51.326 --> 23:53.317
Everywhere else say "Dr Martens".

23:53.368 --> 23:55.405
- I love them.
- These ones are special.

23:55.451 --> 23:58.023
- Do you sell a lot of them?
- Yeah. Go like hot cakes.

23:58.076 --> 23:59.652
Do you want to try one on? Shall we?

23:59.701 --> 24:01.359
I fucking want them.

24:01.409 --> 24:03.863
- If you swear... I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

24:03.910 --> 24:06.196
- Shaun, don't swear.
- I want them ones.

24:06.243 --> 24:08.482
- Listen, you can...
- I don't want them.

24:08.535 --> 24:11.236
Chicken, don't upset your mum, eh?
Let's try 'em on.

24:11.284 --> 24:13.489
Are you ready, Shaun?
- Yeah.

24:13.535 --> 24:14.992
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

24:15.035 --> 24:17.404
- You don't seem very confident.
- Just do it.

24:17.451 --> 24:20.983
Your mum's not gonna come round,
is she, and whack my door down?

24:21.035 --> 24:22.825
No. Just fricking do it.

24:22.868 --> 24:25.107
Right. Here we go.

24:26.201 --> 24:28.192
- Get that mop off.
- It's coming.

24:28.243 --> 24:30.280
It's coming off.

24:30.326 --> 24:32.317
- Oh, eh.
Ooh!

24:34.201 --> 24:35.991
Flippin' heck. Eh.

24:36.034 --> 24:38.819
- You have a right pink head.
- We're getting going now.

24:38.868 --> 24:41.570
- Stop fidgeting.
- You're doing a good job, mate.

24:41.618 --> 24:43.905
Oh, mate, it looks better already, that.

24:43.952 --> 24:46.404
- Don't it, Milk?
- Definitely. Definitely.

24:46.451 --> 24:48.442
- You're looking good.
- Head down.

24:50.284 --> 24:52.987
Oh, there's loads of it.
It's just never-ending.

24:53.034 --> 24:55.950
Don't be rough with him, Lol.
He's only a baby.

24:57.034 --> 25:00.116
- Put your head up.
- You just told me to put it down, Lol.

25:00.159 --> 25:02.483
And what an hairline, girls, eh?

25:02.535 --> 25:04.324
Don't forget that bit.

25:04.368 --> 25:05.944
I can see it.

25:06.034 --> 25:08.404
Honestly, mate, it's sterling.

25:09.493 --> 25:10.867
Get it off.

25:10.910 --> 25:13.612
Really smart, in't he? In't he smart, eh?

25:13.660 --> 25:16.326
- He does look good.
- Mate, I'm well impressed.

25:17.410 --> 25:19.815
There we go, mate. That's you done.

25:19.868 --> 25:21.325
Look at that!

25:21.368 --> 25:23.821
Brush him down. He looks like a Yeti!

25:23.868 --> 25:26.439
- Oh, mate, so smart, that.
- That's good, that.

25:26.493 --> 25:28.484
Honestly, mate, you look sterling.

25:28.535 --> 25:30.656
- So, am I in the gang now?
- Well, not yet.

25:30.702 --> 25:32.941
Get your shirt on.
Let's see your Ben Sherman.

25:33.034 --> 25:34.989
I... I ain't got a Ben Sherman.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.606
- You telling me you've not got a shirt?
- No.

25:37.660 --> 25:39.485
You told me to get jeans and the boots.

25:39.535 --> 25:42.651
Are you having a laugh?
You can't go out all nipply, can you?

25:42.702 --> 25:46.067
You're gonna have to come back next week.
I'll see you, mate.

25:46.118 --> 25:49.649
- Honestly, have I really gotta go?
- Yeah, really, really.

25:49.702 --> 25:51.491
Go on. You're gonna have to get off.

25:51.535 --> 25:53.739
Shut t'door behind you,
there's a good lad.

25:54.743 --> 25:56.817
Oh, hang on, I forgot about summat.

25:56.868 --> 25:58.526
I were fucking lying!

25:59.493 --> 26:02.063
Come here and give me a big hug.
Come here, fella.

26:02.118 --> 26:05.946
I'm really proud of you, mate.
You look brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

26:06.034 --> 26:08.654
Get that body covered up
before t'girls go mad!

26:08.702 --> 26:09.696
Ooh!

26:09.743 --> 26:12.314
Amazing. Bang on.

26:12.368 --> 26:14.359
Lol picked that for you.

26:14.410 --> 26:17.491
- Look at that.
- It's a good fit, that. It's a good fit.

26:17.535 --> 26:19.157
Let's have a look at you.

26:19.201 --> 26:20.398
Ah, mate.

26:20.451 --> 26:22.608
What a transformation!

26:22.660 --> 26:24.318
He looks dead cute.

26:24.368 --> 26:25.826
Pleased with it?

26:25.868 --> 26:27.824
- Look at that.
- Ah, mate.

26:27.868 --> 26:29.693
Bloody hell, here he is.
- Gadget!

26:29.743 --> 26:32.278
Look at this.
- What? Who are you?

26:32.326 --> 26:34.317
Oh-ho-ho, Shaun!

26:34.368 --> 26:36.986
Oh-ho-ho! Look at that. Come here.

26:37.034 --> 26:38.658
That's it. Good lad, Gadge.

26:38.702 --> 26:40.242
Well done, mate.

26:40.285 --> 26:42.774
Louie Louie

26:43.243 --> 26:45.115
# Louie, Louie

26:45.827 --> 26:48.112
# Oh, my baby

26:54.618 --> 26:56.692
# Louie, Louie

26:57.410 --> 26:59.614
# Oh, my baby

27:05.743 --> 27:07.734
# You know what I mean

27:08.743 --> 27:10.734
# Louie, Louie

27:10.827 --> 27:13.030
# We're gonna sail the sea

27:14.285 --> 27:16.275
# No, no, no, no, no

27:17.034 --> 27:18.989
# Now I'm finding a girl

27:19.034 --> 27:22.032
# Louie, Louie
# Louie, Louie

27:25.493 --> 27:28.491
# Hey, let me hear you now

27:28.535 --> 27:30.525
# Louie, Louie

27:31.410 --> 27:33.862
# Oh, baby

27:33.909 --> 27:36.612
# I've got to go

27:36.660 --> 27:37.822
# Oh, yeah

27:37.867 --> 27:39.658
# Let me tell you again

27:39.702 --> 27:41.692
# Louie, Louie

27:42.451 --> 27:44.442
# Oh, baby

27:50.827 --> 27:53.030
# Now, I'm finding a girl

27:54.034 --> 27:55.824
# Louie, Louie

27:55.868 --> 27:58.107
# Oh, she look so sweet

27:58.159 --> 27:59.154
# No

27:59.201 --> 28:01.275
# No, no, no, no, no

28:02.034 --> 28:04.191
# Louie, Louie

28:07.493 --> 28:09.235
# You can talk to me

28:10.243 --> 28:13.241
# Hey, let me hear you now

28:13.285 --> 28:15.074
# Louie, Louie

28:15.118 --> 28:16.492
# Louie

28:16.535 --> 28:18.027
# Tell me

28:18.076 --> 28:19.817
# Tell me, baby

28:19.868 --> 28:21.858
# Come on, now

28:23.410 --> 28:24.607
# All right, now

28:27.118 --> 28:29.607
# Oh, baby...

28:35.535 --> 28:36.944
'Ey up, eh?

28:37.034 --> 28:38.611
Home sweet home.

28:38.660 --> 28:41.823
- It's all right round here, Shaun.
- It's a nice area, mate.

28:41.868 --> 28:44.238
Cheers for today.
It's been the best day of my life.

28:44.285 --> 28:45.482
Aw.

28:45.535 --> 28:47.324
Fella, man,
you are more than welcome.

28:47.368 --> 28:49.821
And I mean that
from the bottom of my heart. Any time.

28:49.868 --> 28:51.740
- Tell him.
- Definitely. Any time, mate.

28:51.826 --> 28:54.315
- Come here, you.
Any time, day or night.

28:54.368 --> 28:56.359
Oh, oh!
Woo!

28:56.410 --> 28:58.531
- Wa-hey!
- You've been practising!

28:58.577 --> 29:00.614
Cheers for the haircut, Lol.

29:00.660 --> 29:03.859
No worries. You make sure you come to
me when it needs redoing.

29:03.909 --> 29:06.943
- Cheers for the shitty tea, Gadget.
- Get you!

29:10.702 --> 29:11.697
Shaun?

29:12.702 --> 29:13.697
Yeah?

29:14.909 --> 29:16.533
Come here, please.

29:17.493 --> 29:19.484
I just want to go straight to bed, Mum.

29:19.535 --> 29:22.201
Come here, please.
You're two hours late.

29:23.118 --> 29:25.867
- Please, Mum.
- Shaun, just come here!

29:35.493 --> 29:36.950
Oh, my God.

29:40.742 --> 29:42.236
Mum, please.

29:42.285 --> 29:43.741
Please, Mum.

29:43.826 --> 29:45.817
- Shaun, come on.
- Oh, man.

29:45.868 --> 29:48.321
- Oh, Mum, please.
- I'm not messing around.

29:48.368 --> 29:49.908
Now, in.

29:51.034 --> 29:52.611
In you go, you.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.236
- Eh, Shaun!
- Shaun, mate!

29:54.285 --> 29:55.741
- Oh.
- Oh.

29:56.909 --> 29:58.403
Who's Lol?

30:00.034 --> 30:01.029
Me.

30:02.076 --> 30:04.067
What have you done to his hair?

30:05.909 --> 30:09.903
I... I did ask him, before I did it, if...
if you was all right with it.

30:09.951 --> 30:11.906
Don't you think
you should have asked me?

30:11.951 --> 30:12.946
Yeah.

30:13.034 --> 30:14.611
I'm sorry.

30:14.660 --> 30:16.816
Shaun, did I not ask you
if it was all right?

30:16.868 --> 30:19.154
If he said, "Jump off a cliff",
would you do that?

30:20.535 --> 30:21.483
No.

30:21.535 --> 30:25.363
To be honest, you all look a bit... old
to be hanging around with him.

30:25.410 --> 30:28.657
I'm only in the er... year bel...
above in school.

30:28.701 --> 30:31.071
- Are you joking?
- No.

30:32.868 --> 30:34.491
I've got problems.

30:35.868 --> 30:39.115
Yeah, well, you will have problems
if you touch his hair again.

30:39.160 --> 30:41.234
I'm really sorry.
- Who's Woody?

30:42.243 --> 30:43.273
Behave.

30:43.326 --> 30:46.241
- I'm Woody. I'm sorry, love.
- No, it's fine.

30:46.285 --> 30:47.612
It's erm...

30:47.659 --> 30:51.653
I just wanted to thank you. He said he's
being bullied and you'd helped him out.

30:51.701 --> 30:54.616
- You're welcome.
- Yeah, I really appreciate that.

30:54.659 --> 30:58.321
And the clothes and stuff.
I think he likes 'em. I don't mind that, at all.

30:58.368 --> 31:00.158
But the hair is not good.

31:00.201 --> 31:01.611
I'm really sorry.

31:01.659 --> 31:05.357
I am. I wouldn't have done it
if I knew you didn't like it.

31:05.410 --> 31:07.862
Listen, I'm gonna leave him here with you.

31:07.909 --> 31:10.066
I'm gonna trust you, Shaun.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.694
All right? Give us a kiss.

31:12.701 --> 31:16.114
- See you later. Nice to meet you.
What's your name, love?

31:16.160 --> 31:18.234
- Cynthia.
- Nice to meet you, Cynthia.

31:18.285 --> 31:19.825
Nice to meet you all.

31:19.868 --> 31:21.905
- See you in a bit, Shaun.
- See you, love.

31:21.951 --> 31:23.942
- See you, later.
- Bye, Mum.

31:23.993 --> 31:25.403
You idiot!

31:26.410 --> 31:27.950
You shit yourself.

31:28.035 --> 31:28.982
What?

31:29.035 --> 31:31.488
- You shit yourself. You did.
- I didn't shit myself.

31:35.410 --> 31:36.950
Hey, here he is!

31:37.035 --> 31:39.653
- Where have you been?
- I've been getting a drink.

31:39.701 --> 31:42.865
- You've been gone an hour.
- Look how pissed he is. Babycham?

31:42.909 --> 31:44.699
Have you had it through a straw?

31:44.743 --> 31:46.650
Wakey-wakey!

31:46.701 --> 31:48.822
Pissed as a fart. Look at him.

31:51.701 --> 31:53.822
You fancy Smell, don't you?

31:53.868 --> 31:55.147
- Ah!
- No.

31:55.201 --> 31:56.529
Do you like Smell?

31:57.535 --> 32:00.486
Listen, I think, Shaun...
I think you've got a great chance.

32:00.535 --> 32:02.857
- Oh, aye, love.
- You ain't got nothing to lose.

32:02.909 --> 32:04.615
- Go on.
- She can only say no, mate.

32:04.659 --> 32:06.650
You wanna give it a crack?

32:06.701 --> 32:08.656
This can be a beautiful thing.

32:08.701 --> 32:10.822
- Oh, my God. Fuckin' hell.
- Boob height.

32:10.868 --> 32:12.823
That might be the perfect height.

32:12.868 --> 32:14.278
Would you...

32:14.327 --> 32:16.483
like to take a turn up the garden with me?

32:16.535 --> 32:18.655
Oh, that's sweet.

32:18.701 --> 32:20.608
You are, you're a little sweetheart.

32:20.659 --> 32:22.614
I told you. It's making me emotional.

32:24.035 --> 32:25.409
Ladies first.

32:25.452 --> 32:26.992
Come on, then.
- Watch it.

32:27.035 --> 32:29.191
- Ooh, sorry, mate.
- It's all right.

32:33.035 --> 32:35.867
- Look at the sky.
- This is perfect, this is.

32:36.826 --> 32:38.982
Look at the moonlight. It's beautiful.

32:39.035 --> 32:40.492
Like you.

32:42.493 --> 32:44.069
That is so cute.

32:45.076 --> 32:47.067
You're a real charmer, you are.

32:49.076 --> 32:50.486
Careful.

32:52.076 --> 32:53.533
it were just...

32:56.701 --> 32:58.608
What the fuck's that?

32:58.659 --> 33:00.816
That sounds like the coppers,
that does.

33:00.868 --> 33:02.491
Gary.

33:02.534 --> 33:03.529
Gadget!

33:03.618 --> 33:05.822
It's Gadget's mum and dad.

33:05.868 --> 33:08.819
Get the fuck up, Gadge. Listen to me.
I want you to be sober. Yeah?

33:08.868 --> 33:09.863
Sober.

33:09.910 --> 33:11.900
All nice, good, sober.

33:11.951 --> 33:13.942
- I am sober.
- Of course you are.

33:14.035 --> 33:16.605
Fucking hide all the weed an' that, Milk.

33:20.327 --> 33:21.605
Hello?

33:21.659 --> 33:23.650
- Aaargh!
- Get fucking out!

33:32.618 --> 33:33.897
Outside now!

33:33.951 --> 33:37.033
If you want us to turn
the music down, we'll turn it down.

33:37.076 --> 33:39.695
It's too fucking late for that!

33:39.743 --> 33:41.236
These three.

33:41.285 --> 33:43.406
Now get fucking up! Come on.

33:43.452 --> 33:45.691
I'm coming, just...
- Not you. You.

33:45.743 --> 33:47.366
Get outside!

33:47.410 --> 33:48.986
Woody!
- Now!

33:49.035 --> 33:50.491
Come on!

33:50.534 --> 33:52.241
- It's all right.
- Kes, get up.

33:52.285 --> 33:54.276
Yaaah!

33:58.701 --> 34:01.652
Look at him! Fucking hell, Combo!

34:01.701 --> 34:03.656
Fucking hell, look at you!

34:03.701 --> 34:05.941
Look at the fucking size of him.

34:06.035 --> 34:08.190
Wow! Fucking look at you!

34:10.202 --> 34:13.034
- Oh, fucking hell!
- Fucking look at you, man!

34:13.076 --> 34:14.866
- Fucking hell.
- I missed you, man.

34:14.909 --> 34:17.991
Fuck off, man. You fucking gave me
a heart attack, you bastard.

34:18.034 --> 34:19.491
Who the fuck's he?

34:19.534 --> 34:20.944
- Banjo.
- Banjo.

34:23.618 --> 34:26.188
Three and a half years
with this fucking big bastard.

34:26.243 --> 34:27.699
You lovely man.

34:27.743 --> 34:31.072
Tell you what, there's fuck all
that this man hasn't seen.

34:31.118 --> 34:34.318
Banjo, yeah?
Thanks for looking after him, mate.

34:34.368 --> 34:37.070
- Look at the size of him, mate.
- Always ready to have a go.

34:37.118 --> 34:38.908
Meggy! How are you, lad?

34:38.951 --> 34:40.942
- How are you, mate?
- I'm all right.

34:41.034 --> 34:42.610
Milk, fucking hell.

34:42.659 --> 34:44.650
You shit me up there for a minute.

34:44.701 --> 34:46.656
Listen to me now. This dude, here,

34:46.701 --> 34:50.281
he spent three years in the pen for me,
he never said nothing.

34:50.327 --> 34:52.862
If it weren't for him,
I wouldn't be with you guys now.

34:52.909 --> 34:55.149
So, the utmost respect and I mean it.

34:55.202 --> 34:56.658
I mean it.

34:56.701 --> 34:58.194
Look at this, eh?

34:58.243 --> 35:01.691
Look at you. Fucking hell!
You've blossomed, haven't you, love?

35:01.743 --> 35:04.148
- How are you doing?
- Not too bad. How are you?

35:04.202 --> 35:07.069
All right. Easy, easy.
That's my other half, that.

35:08.076 --> 35:10.611
- It's my other half, like.
- Nice one, mate.

35:10.659 --> 35:12.697
I'm happy for yous.

35:13.243 --> 35:14.819
Are you all right?

35:15.826 --> 35:16.821
Yeah.

35:16.868 --> 35:18.657
You look a bit nervous.

35:18.701 --> 35:21.273
I'm not gonna do anything
you don't want me to.

35:22.743 --> 35:24.733
Have you ever done this before?

35:24.826 --> 35:26.236
Done it once.

35:26.285 --> 35:27.658
In Germany.

35:27.701 --> 35:29.194
In Germany?

35:29.243 --> 35:31.482
Why did you go to Germany?

35:31.534 --> 35:33.028
I was...

35:33.077 --> 35:35.647
in Ger... Germany with my dad.

35:35.701 --> 35:38.273
What did you do in Germany
with this girl?

35:38.327 --> 35:39.902
Just kissed her.

35:39.951 --> 35:42.156
Did you? Was she pretty?

35:43.285 --> 35:45.571
Prettier than me?

35:45.618 --> 35:47.407
- No way.
- Really?

35:49.202 --> 35:51.192
Well, that's really cute of you.

35:52.202 --> 35:54.276
Do you want a kiss?

35:57.035 --> 35:59.025
We'll leave it today.

36:10.659 --> 36:13.823
You might look about four,
but you kiss like a forty-year-old.

36:13.868 --> 36:15.859
You're dead sensitive.

36:17.285 --> 36:18.694
Are you all right?

36:20.659 --> 36:21.857
Are you sure?

36:22.868 --> 36:24.859
Do you want me to kiss you again?

36:40.659 --> 36:42.449
Do you wanna suck my tits?

36:42.493 --> 36:45.491
- Tell 'em a story.
- All right, if yous are making me.

36:46.701 --> 36:48.822
All right, it took a little bit of time.

36:48.868 --> 36:51.403
- But we did end up running things.
- We certainly did.

36:51.451 --> 36:54.568
I mean, it's just...
I mean, for three weeks, right,

36:54.618 --> 36:56.988
this fucking wog...

36:57.035 --> 36:59.605
Right? Proper horrible.

37:01.618 --> 37:03.028
Sorry, mate, sorry.

37:03.118 --> 37:05.274
Didn't mean nothing by it.

37:05.326 --> 37:08.076
You know, just slip of the tongue, like.

37:08.118 --> 37:10.689
Sorry. This, you know, this brown gentleman...

37:12.243 --> 37:14.696
...who... he was a bully,
he was a horrible bully.

37:14.743 --> 37:17.113
No matter what colour he was,
he was a bully.

37:17.160 --> 37:19.151
- And I hate bullies. Don't I, Wood?
- Yeah.

37:19.202 --> 37:21.524
I can't stand them, man.
I can't stand 'em.

37:21.576 --> 37:25.024
But for three weeks, right,
this fella was robbing my pudding.

37:25.118 --> 37:26.908
What kind of pudding was it?

37:26.952 --> 37:28.942
Doesn't matter what pudding it was.

37:28.993 --> 37:30.735
The pudding's not the point.

37:30.785 --> 37:34.115
The point is,
he was taking my pudding off me.

37:34.160 --> 37:36.944
And I just thought,
"Nah, I'm not having it. I don't care.

37:36.993 --> 37:39.233
You're not getting my pudding,
that's it. "

37:39.284 --> 37:42.567
So, I grabbed it and I've gone,
"No, mate, no, you're not having it. "

37:42.618 --> 37:44.194
He was like...

37:44.242 --> 37:46.363
"White boy...

37:46.409 --> 37:48.483
Give me your pud-pud. "

37:49.701 --> 37:53.362
Proper! Do you know what I mean?
And I've just thought, "No, man. "

37:53.409 --> 37:55.566
Nah, he did, right.

37:55.618 --> 37:57.608
Eh!

37:58.785 --> 38:01.190
Look at t'moosh on him.
- Smell his finger.

38:03.618 --> 38:05.608
And who's been bloody smooching?

38:06.576 --> 38:08.448
Come here, Shaun! Come on, man.

38:09.451 --> 38:12.366
I've got someone I want you to meet.
Come and stand here.

38:12.409 --> 38:15.277
Now, listen to me.
This is a very special friend of mine.

38:15.326 --> 38:16.903
Combo, Shaun.

38:16.952 --> 38:18.444
Newest recruit.

38:18.493 --> 38:19.986
Shaun. Combo.

38:20.035 --> 38:21.575
What are you doing?

38:21.618 --> 38:23.692
Just want to shake your hand.

38:23.743 --> 38:25.319
Did you?

38:28.243 --> 38:30.778
Are you a proper little skinhead,
then, yeah?

38:31.701 --> 38:32.696
Yeah.

38:34.993 --> 38:36.984
You look like a little Action Man.

38:37.035 --> 38:40.945
Like a little Barbie doll.
You're dressed up an' all that. Look.

38:40.993 --> 38:42.485
What?

38:45.952 --> 38:48.487
I'm only messing with you, you little fucker.

38:48.534 --> 38:50.525
I'm only messing with you.

38:50.576 --> 38:53.030
He's all right.
- You're all right.

38:53.118 --> 38:55.986
Nice one, lad.
Sit down, anyway, I'm telling a story.

38:56.035 --> 38:57.492
Sit next to Milky.

39:01.159 --> 39:03.482
Anyway, where was I?
What... Where was I?

39:03.535 --> 39:06.568
You were on about that er...
"brown gentleman"

39:06.618 --> 39:08.407
stealing your "pud-pud".

39:08.451 --> 39:12.361
That's right, yeah. Yeah.
So, I've said, "No, you're not having it. "

39:12.409 --> 39:15.573
This one day, right,
I've been grafting all morning,

39:15.618 --> 39:18.901
just shovelling shit, constantly,
all morning, non-stop.

39:18.952 --> 39:20.693
Weren't I? And I'm fucking starving.

39:20.743 --> 39:22.152
# gentle piano

39:22.201 --> 39:23.943
You know, like that proper hunger.

39:23.993 --> 39:28.117
And I'm thinking, "Right, just eat my pudding,
just go and eat my pudding. "

39:28.159 --> 39:31.193
I've just finished
the last fucking mouthful and then,

39:31.243 --> 39:34.443
this big, black, sweaty hand

39:34.493 --> 39:37.277
has just gone wallop, right in my pudding.

39:37.326 --> 39:39.116
Do you know what I mean?

39:39.159 --> 39:43.283
Proper big cigar fingers,
all over my fucking crumble and custard...

39:44.284 --> 39:46.690
I just thought,
"No, I'm not having it, I don't care.

39:46.743 --> 39:49.527
You're not getting my pudding, that's it. "

39:49.576 --> 39:53.321
I just took his hand out and just looked
him right in the face and I've gone...

40:03.409 --> 40:04.488
Woody.

40:30.701 --> 40:32.906
So, last night was good fun, weren't it?

40:32.952 --> 40:36.317
- Don't start.
- I'm just saying, a really good night.

40:36.368 --> 40:39.568
I know what sort of a bloody night it was.
It were awkward.

40:39.618 --> 40:42.284
It was er... a little on the tense side.

40:42.326 --> 40:44.317
I know, mate, I'm sorry.

40:44.368 --> 40:47.781
I knew he'd do it. I knew he'd have to
throw his bloody weight around.

40:47.827 --> 40:49.449
Has to be number one.

40:49.493 --> 40:52.823
He were like that before he went in.
Nowt's frigging changed, at all.

40:52.910 --> 40:55.398
Hang on. Wait.
He hardly did anything wrong, anyway.

40:55.451 --> 40:57.821
- I thought he was all right.
- I've got an idea.

40:57.910 --> 41:01.073
How about you climb out of his arse
for five minutes, Puke, eh?

41:01.118 --> 41:03.192
Trust you to fucking jump on his dick.

41:03.243 --> 41:06.028
I'm not. I'm just saying,
he was just telling a story.

41:06.118 --> 41:08.073
You asked for a story, he told it you.

41:08.118 --> 41:10.523
I'll tell you a story
if you don't shut your mouth.

41:15.451 --> 41:16.909
All right, boys?

41:16.952 --> 41:19.025
- You all right, Combo?
- All right, Gadge.

41:19.076 --> 41:20.902
- Puke.
- All right, mate.

41:20.952 --> 41:23.191
'Ey up. What's up?

41:23.243 --> 41:26.324
- Can I just have a little word with you?
- I've got a brew coming.

41:26.368 --> 41:28.904
- Only be two minutes. Come 'ed.
- Bastard.

41:28.952 --> 41:31.025
Woody, don't be long cos I wanna get off.

41:31.118 --> 41:33.322
- All right, love.
- Be two minutes, Lol.

41:35.284 --> 41:36.778
All right, lad?

41:39.118 --> 41:40.575
I said, "All right?"

41:40.618 --> 41:43.450
What was that for? That hurt!

41:43.493 --> 41:46.491
- Woody, hurry up.
- I will, love, yeah.

41:50.034 --> 41:53.032
Milky, I'd watch it.
I think summat's gonna kick off.

41:53.118 --> 41:55.404
Don't worry. I'm more than ready.

41:55.451 --> 41:57.905
You're making a big deal
out of nothing, anyway.

41:57.952 --> 41:59.409
- He's all right.
- He's not.

41:59.451 --> 42:00.446
Kel!

42:00.493 --> 42:02.531
Kelly, you don't even know him.

42:05.785 --> 42:07.906
- What's up?
You all right, Woods?

42:07.952 --> 42:09.942
All right, lad.

42:13.034 --> 42:15.570
- Go on, then. What's happened?
- We've to...

42:15.618 --> 42:17.775
We've to bob round tomorrow morning.

42:36.951 --> 42:40.945
I tell you, I shouldn't be here, you know.
This don't feel good, at all.

42:40.993 --> 42:44.405
Look at the size of that brew.
Who drinks a brew that big?

42:50.159 --> 42:54.367
I bet you all thought I was a right fucking
horrible, horrible, horrible

42:54.410 --> 42:56.566
little bastard the other day, didn't you?

42:56.618 --> 42:58.573
- A little bit.
- A bit?

42:58.618 --> 43:01.616
Tell the truth, Wood, man.
I was fucking horrible, weren't I?

43:01.702 --> 43:03.408
- A bit of a bastard, man.
- Yeah.

43:03.451 --> 43:05.442
Yeah, well, you were a snake.

43:06.993 --> 43:09.612
You were a fucking serpent
from the Bible, weren't you?

43:10.827 --> 43:14.026
Do you wanna know why, Wood?
Do you want me to tell you why?

43:14.118 --> 43:15.112
Yeah?

43:16.118 --> 43:18.404
Cos see that man, there, Milky?

43:19.410 --> 43:20.902
That man there

43:20.951 --> 43:22.574
took abuse off me.

43:23.618 --> 43:26.735
And I said some horrible things, Milk,
and I'm fucking sorry.

43:27.743 --> 43:29.485
You let me abuse him.

43:29.535 --> 43:32.237
And what did you do?
What did you do, Wood?

43:32.285 --> 43:34.571
- I didn't do anything.
- I can't hear you.

43:34.618 --> 43:37.569
- I didn't do nothing.
- Exactly. Nothing. Fuck all.

43:37.618 --> 43:39.194
Neither did any of yous.

43:39.243 --> 43:42.525
Not one of yous stood up
and made yourself count for that man there.

43:42.577 --> 43:44.781
And that was fucking wrong.

43:45.785 --> 43:49.565
Milk, honest to God,
I'm really glad you came here today.

43:49.618 --> 43:51.739
And I mean that, mate,
I really mean that.

43:52.743 --> 43:55.906
Cos I've got one question to ask you.
Just one question.

43:55.951 --> 44:00.775
When you've heard it, if you want to leave,
you can leave, that's fine by me.

44:00.827 --> 44:02.817
But I've got one question to ask you.

44:02.867 --> 44:04.905
Do you consider yourself

44:04.951 --> 44:06.741
English or Jamaican?

44:19.993 --> 44:21.402
English.

44:28.827 --> 44:32.571
Lovely. I love you for that.
That's fucking great. I'm proud, man.

44:32.618 --> 44:35.106
Learn from him.
That's a proud man, there.

44:37.618 --> 44:39.408
That's what we need, man.

44:39.451 --> 44:41.821
That's what this nation
has been built on.

44:41.909 --> 44:45.073
Proud men. Proud fucking warriors.

44:45.118 --> 44:49.112
Two thousand years,
this little tiny fucking island

44:49.159 --> 44:51.364
has been raped and pillaged

44:51.410 --> 44:54.408
by people who have come here
and wanted a piece of it.

44:54.451 --> 44:58.030
Two fucking world wars,
men have laid down their lives for this.

44:59.034 --> 45:01.072
For this, and for what?

45:01.118 --> 45:03.689
So we can stick our fucking flag
in the ground and say,

45:03.743 --> 45:05.449
"Yeah, this is England

45:05.493 --> 45:07.069
and this is England

45:07.118 --> 45:08.694
and this is England. "

45:10.993 --> 45:12.783
And for what?

45:12.826 --> 45:14.863
For what now?

45:14.909 --> 45:16.900
Eh, what for?

45:17.909 --> 45:21.192
So we can just open the fucking floodgates
and let them all come in?

45:21.243 --> 45:23.115
And say, "Yeah, come on, come in.

45:23.160 --> 45:26.241
Get off your ship. Did you have
a safe journey? Was it hard?

45:26.285 --> 45:29.117
Here y'are, here's a corner,
why don't you build a shop?

45:29.160 --> 45:32.572
Better still, why don't you build a shop
and then build a church?

45:32.618 --> 45:35.569
Follow your own fucking religions.
Do what you want. "

45:35.618 --> 45:39.825
When there's single fucking parents
out there, who can't get a fucking flat

45:39.868 --> 45:41.905
and they're being given to these...

45:41.951 --> 45:45.198
And I'm gonna say it,
cos you're gonna have to fucking hear it.

45:45.243 --> 45:48.691
We're giving the flats
to these fucking Pakis. Right?

45:48.743 --> 45:53.032
Who've got 50 and 60
in a fucking flat on their own.

45:53.118 --> 45:55.358
Right? We're giving that to them.

45:55.410 --> 45:58.491
There's three and a half million
unemployed out there.

45:58.535 --> 46:01.900
Three and a half million of us,
who can't find fucking work.

46:01.951 --> 46:05.115
Cos they're taking them all.
Cos it's fucking cheap labour.

46:05.160 --> 46:06.735
Cheap and easy labour.

46:06.784 --> 46:10.197
Fucking cheap and easy,
which makes us cheap and easy.

46:10.243 --> 46:12.530
Three and a half fucking million!

46:12.577 --> 46:15.029
It's not a joke. It's not a fucking joke.

46:15.076 --> 46:19.070
And that Thatcher sits there
in her fucking ivory tower

46:19.118 --> 46:21.736
and sends us on a fucking phoney war!

46:21.784 --> 46:23.159
The Falklands?

46:23.201 --> 46:24.991
The fucking Falklands?

46:25.034 --> 46:27.025
What the fuck's The Falklands?

46:27.118 --> 46:30.069
Fucking innocent men,
good fucking strong men.

46:30.118 --> 46:33.282
Good soldiers,
real people losing their lives,

46:33.326 --> 46:36.360
going over there thinking
they're fighting for a fucking cause.

46:36.410 --> 46:39.194
What are they fighting for?
What are they fighting against?

46:39.243 --> 46:41.530
Fucking shepherds!
Shepherds with fucking...

46:41.577 --> 46:43.567
Shut up about The Falklands.

46:43.618 --> 46:45.194
- Why?
- Cos I want you to.

46:45.243 --> 46:48.241
There's fucking loads of dickheads dying
out there for nothing.

46:48.285 --> 46:50.489
My fucking dad weren't a dickhead!

46:50.535 --> 46:51.813
What are you doing?

46:51.909 --> 46:53.900
- Fuck off! Shut up!
- What am I doing wrong?

46:53.951 --> 46:56.357
Whoa, there, little one.
What's wrong, mate?

46:56.410 --> 46:58.945
- Tell me the truth. Come on.
- I just fucking...

46:58.993 --> 47:00.451
That's it. Go on.

47:00.493 --> 47:02.484
My fucking dad died in that war!

47:02.535 --> 47:04.526
- Your dad died?
- Yeah. Get off!

47:05.577 --> 47:08.575
- Fucking hell, mate, I'm sorry.
- Fucking shut up about it!

47:08.618 --> 47:10.075
I'm sorry, mate.

47:10.118 --> 47:11.943
Fucking hell, I'm sorry, lad.

47:12.951 --> 47:14.906
I'm sorry. I never knew he died, man.

47:14.951 --> 47:16.361
Fucking hell.

47:16.410 --> 47:18.400
Oh, look, mate, if I'd have known,

47:18.452 --> 47:21.982
honest, I wouldn't have said, man,
but what I'm telling you is the truth.

47:22.035 --> 47:25.151
I can't lie to you.
It's a pathetic war, man.

47:25.201 --> 47:28.484
And you want your dad's life
to mean something, don't you?

47:28.535 --> 47:30.904
And this breaks my fucking heart to say it.

47:30.951 --> 47:32.942
We shouldn't have been there.

47:32.993 --> 47:35.907
She lied to us.
She lied to me. She lied to you.

47:35.951 --> 47:38.440
But, most importantly, she lied to your dad.

47:38.493 --> 47:43.197
If you don't stand up and fight this fucking fight
that's going on on the streets,

47:43.243 --> 47:45.447
your dad died for nothing.

47:45.493 --> 47:47.283
He died for nothing.

47:47.326 --> 47:49.447
You've got to carry it on, man, in here.

47:50.410 --> 47:54.190
In your little fucking heart,
you've got the pride of your dad, man.

47:57.951 --> 47:59.231
Fucking hell.

48:00.617 --> 48:03.948
That little fucking whippersnapper
has set the standard.

48:04.951 --> 48:07.902
- Can you believe that, Banj?
- You can't, can you, at that age?

48:07.951 --> 48:09.231
Fucking hell.

48:09.285 --> 48:10.742
What a gem.

48:10.784 --> 48:12.575
What a fucking gem.

48:12.617 --> 48:14.111
All right, look.

48:23.535 --> 48:25.526
There's the line, boys.

48:25.577 --> 48:28.361
That means
you're all quite welcome to just leave

48:28.410 --> 48:31.692
and leave now and never come back
and that's it, the end of it.

48:32.701 --> 48:34.491
But if you wanna stay,

48:34.535 --> 48:36.324
this is a proper fight.

48:36.368 --> 48:40.196
Now yous all either cross that line
and go your merry little way...

48:41.201 --> 48:44.034
...or you stay where you are
and you come with me.

48:44.118 --> 48:45.990
The choice is yours, boys.

48:48.118 --> 48:50.405
Fucking hell!
That was a bit quick, weren't it?

48:50.452 --> 48:52.904
I ain't being fucking brainwashed, Combo.

48:52.951 --> 48:55.357
Oh, listen to fucking Sigmund Void there.

48:55.410 --> 48:58.573
You're well out of line.
Well out of line, man.

48:58.618 --> 49:00.608
Come on, lads, let's have you.

49:00.701 --> 49:01.945
Come on, then.

49:01.993 --> 49:03.486
Come on, Puke, mate.

49:03.535 --> 49:05.324
Sit down.

49:06.410 --> 49:08.151
You what?

49:08.201 --> 49:10.192
Kes, just sit down.

49:10.243 --> 49:14.486
No. No, you can't be serious, mate.
We'll talk about this outside.

49:14.535 --> 49:16.193
Kes, just sit down.

49:16.243 --> 49:18.731
Puke, man, fucking come.
What you on about?

49:18.784 --> 49:20.527
Look, he's fucking right.

49:21.535 --> 49:23.526
What can I do, man? Are you coming?

49:23.576 --> 49:24.358
No.

49:24.410 --> 49:27.989
- Gadge, come on, Tubs, man.
- Fuck off calling me Tubs!

49:28.035 --> 49:29.657
I'm sick of you, Woody.

49:29.701 --> 49:32.734
This is why I'm staying,
because you're always taking the piss,

49:32.784 --> 49:34.775
making me feel that fucking big.

49:34.826 --> 49:36.817
He's put things into perspective.

49:37.701 --> 49:40.782
Look at the other night.
You didn't step up once then.

49:46.410 --> 49:47.902
Join me.

49:53.368 --> 49:56.070
Milky, man,
I know I let you down the other night,

49:56.118 --> 49:59.613
but I swear to you
I'll never fucking do it again. Look at me.

49:59.701 --> 50:02.616
I'd never do it again.
I swear to God I wouldn't, man.

50:04.618 --> 50:07.189
You're my bro, man. What the fuck?

50:19.743 --> 50:21.022
Come on, mate.

50:28.118 --> 50:30.571
Shaun? Come on, man. We're off.

50:30.618 --> 50:32.655
Come on, Shaun.
- No.

50:32.701 --> 50:34.988
Shaun, man, you can't fucking stay here.

50:35.035 --> 50:36.196
Shaun?

50:37.202 --> 50:41.029
He's just a kid. The things you've said
have made him want to stay.

50:41.076 --> 50:43.281
Woody, I wanna make my dad proud.

50:43.327 --> 50:44.783
Listen, love...

50:44.826 --> 50:46.616
See you later, mate.

50:46.701 --> 50:48.692
See you later, Lol, love.

50:48.743 --> 50:50.733
He's 12. I can't leave him here.

50:50.784 --> 50:53.190
- Go.
- Nothing we can do if he wants to stay.

50:53.243 --> 50:55.482
You fucking look after him, do you hear me?

50:55.534 --> 50:58.023
He can look after himself. He's proved that.

50:58.076 --> 50:59.569
See yous later.

50:59.618 --> 51:01.608
Come on, love.

51:01.659 --> 51:03.697
Come on, now.

51:10.951 --> 51:12.574
See you later, mate.

51:16.618 --> 51:19.569
Don't forget, you've got a snake
in the grass with you there.

51:19.618 --> 51:21.325
You're a good man.

51:21.368 --> 51:23.359
A brave good man, man.

51:24.368 --> 51:26.074
A really good man.

51:26.118 --> 51:29.946
A cup of tea for the boys there, Banj.
Few Pot Noodles or something.

51:29.993 --> 51:32.742
I'm fucking gagging for a shit, me,
I'm telling you.

51:51.618 --> 51:53.241
Don't worry about it.

51:54.243 --> 51:56.234
I'll have a word with Woody.

51:56.285 --> 51:58.276
I'll sort it, I promise you.

51:58.327 --> 51:59.902
I just feel really bad.

51:59.951 --> 52:01.907
He looked gutted, Combo.

52:01.951 --> 52:04.191
I know, I feel bad, as well, but...

52:04.243 --> 52:06.234
Oh, fucking hell, let's face it.

52:06.285 --> 52:08.276
Woody's not like me and you.

52:10.160 --> 52:12.909
No, he's fucking certainly not like you.

52:12.951 --> 52:15.902
No-one's ever fucking took a swing at me
like that.

52:15.951 --> 52:17.693
- Really?
- Honest.

52:17.743 --> 52:18.773
Honest.

52:19.743 --> 52:21.532
It's like looking in the mirror.

52:22.285 --> 52:24.820
20 years ago, when I was fucking 12,

52:24.868 --> 52:26.906
taking swings at big men.

52:26.951 --> 52:30.317
I don't know, I just don't like
people speaking about my dad,

52:30.367 --> 52:32.158
even in a nice way.

52:32.202 --> 52:34.903
I don't even like people
speaking about the war.

52:37.035 --> 52:39.025
You loved him, didn't you?

52:41.951 --> 52:42.982
Yeah.

52:45.951 --> 52:47.574
And then you lost him.

52:51.618 --> 52:53.111
Yeah.

52:55.493 --> 52:57.116
I know what it's like.

52:58.493 --> 53:00.483
To have people walk out on you.

53:00.534 --> 53:03.106
To have people just fucking leave you.

53:05.493 --> 53:08.740
Honest, lad, I know how you feel.

53:09.951 --> 53:11.942
If you ever want anyone to talk to...

53:13.368 --> 53:15.158
...someone to cry with

53:15.202 --> 53:17.487
or just to fucking have a hug

53:17.534 --> 53:19.525
or punch the fuck out of 'em,

53:19.576 --> 53:21.732
I'm telling you, I'll be there for you.

53:21.785 --> 53:23.775
I won't turn my back on you.

53:24.951 --> 53:26.741
I promise you that.

53:31.118 --> 53:32.149
Spit.

53:34.326 --> 53:36.530
That's a man's handshake, that.

53:36.576 --> 53:38.034
I promise you.

53:38.951 --> 53:41.275
I won't let you down.

53:41.326 --> 53:44.573
# Soldiers of Islam
are loading their guns

53:44.618 --> 53:46.608
# They're getting ready

53:47.910 --> 53:51.489
# But the Russian tanks
are mowing them down

53:51.534 --> 53:53.324
# They're getting ready

53:55.202 --> 53:59.360
# There's children in Africa
with Tommy guns

53:59.409 --> 54:00.986
# Getting ready

54:01.993 --> 54:05.821
# While the Islam armies
are beckoning on

54:05.868 --> 54:07.906
# They're getting ready

54:09.284 --> 54:11.275
# There's a burning sun

54:11.326 --> 54:14.774
# And it sets in the Western world

54:15.785 --> 54:18.025
# But it rises in the East

54:18.077 --> 54:22.484
# And pretty soon
it's gonna burn your temples down

54:22.952 --> 54:26.566
# While the heads of state
are having their fun

54:27.368 --> 54:28.944
# Are they ready?

54:30.368 --> 54:34.197
# We're looking at the world
through the barrel of a gun

54:34.242 --> 54:35.949
# Are we ready?

54:37.284 --> 54:41.113
# And you stand there
beating on your little war drum

54:41.160 --> 54:42.949
# Are you ready...

54:46.785 --> 54:50.198
- Look at the size of that dog.
- Gadge, have a look at that dog.

54:50.243 --> 54:52.399
Just get on with it.

54:52.451 --> 54:54.821
Excuse me, mate,
is there a toilet here?

54:55.826 --> 54:57.817
Ah, my arse is killing.

54:59.368 --> 55:01.358
- All right, boss?
- Round the back.

55:01.409 --> 55:03.400
- Round the back.
- Cheers, boss.

55:11.660 --> 55:14.658
I am hungry, yeah.
There should be a barbecue or something.

55:14.701 --> 55:16.324
Buffet food...

55:17.326 --> 55:19.116
All right, look, yous three,

55:19.160 --> 55:21.613
yous three, I want yous on your best behaviour.

55:21.660 --> 55:23.734
Right? Your fucking best behaviour.

55:25.035 --> 55:27.026
Ooh, he's got a nice car!

55:29.035 --> 55:30.492
Nice car.

55:31.576 --> 55:33.781
Here they are.
Wait there. Hold it back, lads.

55:33.826 --> 55:35.817
- Just wait there.
- Come on.

55:35.868 --> 55:38.403
Just wait there.
Behave yourself. Wait there.

55:38.451 --> 55:39.909
You all right?

55:41.368 --> 55:43.405
How are you, Arthur? Good to see you.

55:43.451 --> 55:45.240
All right, Lenny, mate.

55:45.284 --> 55:47.275
All right? A pleasure. A pleasure.

55:47.326 --> 55:48.784
All right, mate.

55:49.868 --> 55:53.233
Gentlemen, there is a forgotten word.

55:53.284 --> 55:54.528
No.

55:54.576 --> 55:56.318
An almost forbidden word.

55:57.326 --> 55:59.732
A word that means more to me
than any other.

56:00.785 --> 56:02.610
That word is "England".

56:02.660 --> 56:04.034
Yes!

56:09.035 --> 56:13.739
Once, we flaunted it in the face of the world,
like a banner.

56:13.785 --> 56:15.775
It was a word that stood for power.

56:16.785 --> 56:19.072
A word that stood for freedom.

56:19.117 --> 56:21.109
A word that stood for respect.

56:22.117 --> 56:23.611
But today,

56:23.660 --> 56:27.108
we're scarcely even allowed
to speak the name of our country.

56:27.159 --> 56:28.652
Gadge, are you honestly...

56:28.701 --> 56:31.984
Well, I want to revive that word,
a grand old word,

56:32.035 --> 56:34.026
the word "Englishman".

56:34.077 --> 56:35.237
Yes! Yes!

56:35.284 --> 56:36.279
Yes!

56:38.868 --> 56:40.859
Now we've been marginalised.

56:40.910 --> 56:42.901
We've been called "cranks".

56:42.952 --> 56:44.776
We're not cranks.

56:44.827 --> 56:47.031
Some people say we're racists.

56:47.077 --> 56:49.316
We're not racists. We're realists.

56:49.368 --> 56:51.821
Some people call us Nazis.

56:51.868 --> 56:53.859
We're not Nazis.

56:53.910 --> 56:57.027
No, what we are, we are nationalists.

56:57.077 --> 57:00.857
And there's a reason
people try to pigeonhole us like this.

57:00.910 --> 57:03.778
And that is because of one word, gentlemen.

57:03.827 --> 57:05.817
- Fear.
Yeah.

57:05.868 --> 57:07.444
They fear us.

57:07.493 --> 57:11.439
They fear us because we are the true voice
of the people of this country.

57:11.493 --> 57:13.318
- Yes!
Yes, Lenny.

57:13.368 --> 57:15.405
People who work hard,

57:15.451 --> 57:17.109
pay their way,

57:17.159 --> 57:19.862
it don't matter
what their ethnic background is,

57:19.910 --> 57:22.232
I welcome with open arms in this country.

57:22.284 --> 57:24.987
It's the people who think
we owe them a living.

57:25.035 --> 57:28.033
These are the people that need to go back.

57:28.076 --> 57:29.866
Yes!

57:29.910 --> 57:31.486
Send them back!

57:31.535 --> 57:34.070
- Send the bastards back!
- Send them back!

57:34.118 --> 57:35.492
Send them back!

57:35.535 --> 57:37.905
An English king on a battlefield once said,

57:37.952 --> 57:41.780
"From this day till the end of the world,
only we in it shall be remembered,

57:41.827 --> 57:45.523
we few, we happy few,
we band of brothers. "

57:45.576 --> 57:47.982
Gentlemen, it is the time to stand up
and be counted.

57:48.034 --> 57:50.606
Yes!
- It is the time for action.

57:50.660 --> 57:53.611
Our country has been stolen
from under our noses.

57:53.660 --> 57:55.200
Yes!

57:55.243 --> 57:57.696
Well, gentlemen,
it's time to take it back!

57:57.743 --> 57:58.940
Yes!

57:58.993 --> 58:01.279
Yes! Go on, Lenny! Go on, Lenny!

58:01.326 --> 58:03.780
Are you ready to return to the fight?

58:03.827 --> 58:04.857
Yes!

58:04.910 --> 58:07.480
- Are you ready to shed blood?
Yes!

58:07.535 --> 58:10.651
Are you ready to fight for this country
with your last breath of life?

58:10.701 --> 58:11.863
Yes!

58:11.910 --> 58:14.113
Lenny! Lenny! Lenny!

58:14.159 --> 58:15.617
Lenny! Lenny...

58:15.660 --> 58:19.107
Gentlemen, join our band of brothers.
Sign up today.

58:19.159 --> 58:21.114
Thank you very much. Thank you.

58:21.159 --> 58:22.190
Yes!

58:22.243 --> 58:24.862
I'm going to have a word with Lenny.
Yous wait here.

58:24.910 --> 58:27.445
- Amazing that.
- You're dead right.

58:31.159 --> 58:33.613
Fucking, Gadge.
- What?

58:33.660 --> 58:35.650
Do you not feel bad about Woody?

58:35.702 --> 58:38.368
What do you mean,
do I not feel bad about him? Look.

58:38.451 --> 58:40.442
Look at all these people in here.

58:40.493 --> 58:42.069
This is right.

58:42.118 --> 58:44.820
If it wasn't right,
all these wouldn't be here.

58:44.868 --> 58:46.906
- Think about...
- I'm not saying that.

58:46.952 --> 58:49.618
Do you not feel bad
about just leaving him like that?

58:49.660 --> 58:52.112
- He's been our mate for...
- We've not left him.

58:52.159 --> 58:53.736
I'm still his friend.

58:55.451 --> 58:56.695
Comb...

58:56.743 --> 59:00.488
You know, you're supposed to have
a qualified driver in the front.

59:02.493 --> 59:04.448
Are you gonna fucking report me?

59:04.493 --> 59:06.116
Well, it's illegal.

59:08.576 --> 59:11.064
We're really squashed in the back here.

59:12.451 --> 59:14.442
Can one of us come up the front?

59:21.993 --> 59:24.067
Shall we show him?
Shall we show him?

59:27.660 --> 59:29.282
Don't look, Comb.

59:29.326 --> 59:30.903
What is it, lad?

59:36.535 --> 59:38.110
Fuck off!

59:38.159 --> 59:40.565
That's my fucking boy! Look at that.

59:40.618 --> 59:44.315
That's why he's in the fucking front,
Meggy, you fucking gobshite.

59:44.368 --> 59:47.117
- Do you like it?
- It's fucking brilliant, that.

59:47.159 --> 59:48.569
Fucking brilliant.

59:48.660 --> 59:50.982
Do you reckon Lenny'll mind
that we nicked it?

59:51.034 --> 59:54.945
No, will he fuck. That's going in
the middle of the wall, back in the flat.

59:54.993 --> 59:56.983
We'll build all our stuff round that.

59:57.034 --> 01:00:00.032
That's gonna be our fucking centrepiece.
That's the focus.

01:00:01.451 --> 01:00:03.442
- Glad you like it.
- Nice one, son.

01:00:03.493 --> 01:00:05.448
What's it called, that flag?

01:00:05.493 --> 01:00:07.780
St George's Cross, isn't it, Combo?

01:00:07.827 --> 01:00:10.860
Yeah. St fucking George's Cross.

01:00:11.868 --> 01:00:13.859
You all right there, Pukes, lad?

01:00:15.493 --> 01:00:17.484
Yeah, I am. I was thinking, mate.

01:00:17.535 --> 01:00:19.525
You seem a bit quiet, lad.

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.033
Yeah.

01:00:25.326 --> 01:00:27.281
You got a problem, then, or what?

01:00:27.326 --> 01:00:30.075
No, I've just got things on my mind, Combo.

01:00:30.118 --> 01:00:31.575
Like what?

01:00:33.493 --> 01:00:34.985
Well, like...

01:00:36.034 --> 01:00:38.025
Well, can I ask you something?

01:00:39.034 --> 01:00:42.032
Do you really believe
in all that shit, Combo?

01:00:46.451 --> 01:00:48.109
Fucking hell, Comb!

01:00:48.159 --> 01:00:50.316
Oi, Gadge, come with me.
He's getting me out.

01:00:50.368 --> 01:00:53.236
Open the fucking door!
Get fucking out now!

01:00:53.285 --> 01:00:56.117
- Get fucking out!
- All right, all right, all right.

01:00:56.159 --> 01:00:58.565
Out of the car.
Get out, you little fucking shitbag.

01:00:58.660 --> 01:00:59.608
You...

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.651
don't you fucking ever...

01:01:01.702 --> 01:01:06.938
...fucking ever, ever undermine me again
in front of my fucking troops.

01:01:06.993 --> 01:01:08.983
Do you understand me?

01:01:09.034 --> 01:01:11.239
Do you understand me? Eh? Yeah?

01:01:11.285 --> 01:01:14.532
Now, fuck off back to Woody,
you little fucking queer.

01:01:14.577 --> 01:01:16.781
Go on, fuck off! Fuck off!

01:01:16.826 --> 01:01:19.149
- You little queer.
- Oi, lads.

01:01:20.159 --> 01:01:22.067
- Oi, Shaun, man, come.
- Leave him alone.

01:01:22.118 --> 01:01:24.108
- Oi, come out.
- Sorry, mate.

01:01:24.159 --> 01:01:26.364
- I can't.
- Fuck off. Leave him alone. Walk!

01:01:26.451 --> 01:01:28.027
What the fuck?

01:01:28.076 --> 01:01:30.150
Waaaah!

01:02:08.368 --> 01:02:12.362
Right, this is where all the fucking Pakis
go to work in the chicken factory.

01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:15.242
- Fucking do it, boys.
- Can we go to the chicken factory?

01:02:16.034 --> 01:02:18.239
- Just fucking do it.
- What shall I put?

01:02:18.285 --> 01:02:20.275
Anything. Put anything you want.

01:02:30.784 --> 01:02:32.775
Fucking bastards!

01:02:32.826 --> 01:02:36.655
Don't fucking come back,
you fucking little whore!

01:02:39.452 --> 01:02:41.442
Fuck off.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.984
Go on. On your own.

01:02:45.076 --> 01:02:47.648
Yeah, fuck off, you Paki bastards!

01:02:47.702 --> 01:02:49.324
- Fuck off.
- Go on, son!

01:02:50.326 --> 01:02:51.783
Hey-hey!

01:02:53.493 --> 01:02:56.527
Look at these
little fucking sewer rats. Look.

01:02:57.535 --> 01:02:59.157
Fucking vermin.

01:03:00.243 --> 01:03:01.487
Oi!

01:03:10.034 --> 01:03:14.242
Now, that's our ball now.
Right? And we're playing here.

01:03:14.285 --> 01:03:17.899
So, I suggest you take fucking
Tweedledum and Tweedledee

01:03:17.951 --> 01:03:19.740
and fuck off home.

01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:23.148
If I see you on my streets again...

01:03:24.951 --> 01:03:26.444
...I'll slash you.

01:03:27.951 --> 01:03:31.731
And it'll be a hundred times
fucking worse.

01:03:31.784 --> 01:03:33.159
- All right?
- Yeah.

01:03:33.201 --> 01:03:36.116
Now run home,
cos Mummy's cooking curry. Go on.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.487
Meggy!

01:03:39.868 --> 01:03:41.658
Get in goal, Gadge.

01:04:39.076 --> 01:04:40.652
Have a look in there.

01:04:46.452 --> 01:04:48.027
- Is that for me?
- Yeah.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.150
We need to fly that with pride.

01:04:57.577 --> 01:04:59.152
See you tonight, Woody.

01:05:20.826 --> 01:05:23.907
Hey, Meggy, how do you spell "off"?
Is it one "f" or two?

01:05:25.035 --> 01:05:26.824
Meggy, one "f" or two?

01:05:35.452 --> 01:05:37.442
Get me... a hundred fags,

01:05:37.493 --> 01:05:41.534
two bottles of wine, a bottle of whisky,
and ten cans of lager now.

01:05:41.576 --> 01:05:43.780
You know what you're gonna have?
Nothing.

01:05:43.826 --> 01:05:44.821
What?

01:05:44.868 --> 01:05:47.357
You know you're not supposed
to be here. Go. Out.

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:49.531
Just fucking get 'em, you Paki bastard!

01:05:50.368 --> 01:05:51.991
What did you say?

01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:55.151
Get them, you filthy Paki bastard.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.985
Right, that's it.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.695
Just... Wait till I just...

01:06:03.743 --> 01:06:04.856
Get off!

01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:07.280
- Get out!
- What's going on, mate? Problem?

01:06:07.327 --> 01:06:09.116
He's been calling me a Paki bastard.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.533
Open the door.

01:06:10.576 --> 01:06:13.112
Get your fucking hands off him now!

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.985
Fucking hands off him!

01:06:15.035 --> 01:06:18.483
Take what you want, kid.
Take the fucking whisky and the ciggies.

01:06:18.534 --> 01:06:20.525
Oi, oi!

01:06:21.951 --> 01:06:23.942
Go on, lads, get the gear.

01:06:23.993 --> 01:06:25.984
Come on. Everything.

01:06:26.035 --> 01:06:28.653
Come on, hurry up, don't fuck about.

01:06:31.243 --> 01:06:33.234
What are you fucking doing?

01:06:33.285 --> 01:06:36.318
- I'm having a shit.
- Oh, for fuck's sake, man!

01:06:36.368 --> 01:06:38.359
- Put your arse away.
You bastard.

01:06:38.452 --> 01:06:40.525
Come on, hurry up. Get the stuff, mate.

01:06:40.576 --> 01:06:44.273
For fuck's sake, we need booze
and fags for tonight, lads. Come on.

01:06:44.327 --> 01:06:47.774
Fucking hell, Gadge, could you get
any more fucking sweets, man?

01:06:47.826 --> 01:06:49.106
Fucking hell.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:51.447
- Put 'em in the car.
- Come on.

01:06:51.492 --> 01:06:52.736
Paki!

01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:55.616
Yeah, Paki.

01:06:55.659 --> 01:06:57.983
Picking on a kid, mate? Fucking hell.

01:06:58.035 --> 01:07:00.440
Picking on a fucking kid, was you?

01:07:00.492 --> 01:07:02.151
- Eh?
- Take what you want and go.

01:07:02.243 --> 01:07:06.107
Shut up! I'm talking.
I'm your fucking size. Fuck with me.

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:07.901
You've got what you want. Just go now.

01:07:07.951 --> 01:07:09.741
Don't you fucking dare backchat me,

01:07:09.784 --> 01:07:14.074
cos I will slay you now where you fucking
stand, you fucking Paki cunt.

01:07:14.118 --> 01:07:15.232
Right?

01:07:15.285 --> 01:07:17.654
You listen to fucking me!

01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:20.616
That fucking kid's dad died
for this fucking country.

01:07:20.659 --> 01:07:22.531
What have you fucking done for it?

01:07:22.576 --> 01:07:25.657
Fuck all, but take fucking jobs
off decent people.

01:07:25.701 --> 01:07:27.905
Now, listen, son, listen good.

01:07:27.951 --> 01:07:31.731
We'll be back here whenever we want,
right, cos this is fucking ours now.

01:07:31.784 --> 01:07:34.071
This is ours, this, fucking Sandhu.

01:07:34.118 --> 01:07:36.487
Don't forget that. Any fucking time.

01:07:36.534 --> 01:07:39.449
And clean the place up.
It fucking stinks of curry.

01:07:39.493 --> 01:07:40.950
Fucking stinks.

01:07:40.993 --> 01:07:43.316
Reeks of the fucking shit.

01:07:43.368 --> 01:07:45.654
What yous doing, boys?

01:07:45.701 --> 01:07:49.281
Get in the fucking car, will you?
Get in the fucking car!

01:07:49.327 --> 01:07:51.116
You've got the fucking keys.

01:07:52.534 --> 01:07:55.983
Get in the fucking car now.
Look at my fucking arse!

01:07:56.035 --> 01:07:58.439
Get in the fucking car. Hurry up!

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:01.525
This is a very posh area.

01:08:01.576 --> 01:08:04.657
What did you say
her dad did for a living, Gadget?

01:08:04.701 --> 01:08:06.905
- Works on the oil rigs.
- Fucking hell.

01:08:06.951 --> 01:08:09.949
I fancy some posh totty.
Which one is it?

01:08:09.993 --> 01:08:12.280
- The one with the balloons.
Here.

01:08:12.327 --> 01:08:13.819
Fucking hell.

01:08:13.868 --> 01:08:15.859
Put the brakes on.

01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:17.484
That'll do us, won't it?

01:08:17.533 --> 01:08:19.524
I can't wait to see Smell.

01:08:19.576 --> 01:08:21.982
- So, Smell, you're finally legal.
- Yeah.

01:08:22.035 --> 01:08:24.024
Not that it ever made a difference.

01:08:29.701 --> 01:08:31.692
- Ready? Three...
- Wait, wait.

01:08:31.743 --> 01:08:33.733
Come on. Wait there. Are we all here?

01:08:33.785 --> 01:08:35.278
Right.

01:08:35.327 --> 01:08:38.443
- Smell, get us a drink.
I've had chronic pains.

01:08:38.493 --> 01:08:40.116
- Strippers!
- Constipation.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.316
- Someone at the door!
- Stop now, yeah?

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:43.647
Hi, lad.

01:08:43.701 --> 01:08:45.692
- Hello.
- Woody! Woody!

01:08:45.743 --> 01:08:47.069
Hello-o-o.

01:08:47.118 --> 01:08:50.779
- Hello-o-o.
- Hello-o-o.

01:08:50.826 --> 01:08:52.817
Hello-o-o.

01:08:52.868 --> 01:08:54.526
# Happy...
# Happy...

01:08:54.743 --> 01:08:56.448
# Happy...
# Happy...

01:08:56.493 --> 01:08:58.069
# Happy birthday
# Happy birthday

01:08:58.285 --> 01:09:02.064
# Happy birthday
# Happy birthday

01:09:02.118 --> 01:09:04.439
Happy birthday, Smell!

01:09:06.367 --> 01:09:08.442
It was better in the car.

01:09:08.493 --> 01:09:10.116
Woo! Well, I'm gonna get off.

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.234
Past my bedtime and there's a...

01:09:12.285 --> 01:09:14.773
I've got to tape summat on aardvarks.

01:09:14.826 --> 01:09:17.149
- You're not going, are you?
Woody, stay.

01:09:17.202 --> 01:09:19.238
- Are you coming, Milk?
- Yeah, mate.

01:09:19.285 --> 01:09:21.240
Please, Woods, man, don't go.

01:09:21.285 --> 01:09:23.819
Oh, no, it's nothing personal
with you, mate.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:25.693
I'm just gonna get off.

01:09:25.743 --> 01:09:28.776
Come on, Wood. Fucking hell,
I've brought booze and everything.

01:09:28.826 --> 01:09:30.283
Can't we bury the hatchet?

01:09:30.326 --> 01:09:33.774
I know what you've come for, man.
I'd rather get off, like.

01:09:33.826 --> 01:09:37.523
It's this thing on aardvarks,
I'm really eager to watch it.

01:09:37.576 --> 01:09:40.942
Come on, then, let's have you.
Come on, let's have you, folks.

01:09:40.993 --> 01:09:43.694
You have a good birthday, you,
all right, lovey?

01:09:43.743 --> 01:09:45.649
Sorry to be missioning it off.

01:09:46.658 --> 01:09:48.201
Nice one, mate.

01:09:48.243 --> 01:09:50.033
You look after yourself, you.

01:09:50.077 --> 01:09:52.067
- Bye, Woody.
- See you, Tubby.

01:09:52.118 --> 01:09:53.444
Bye, Milky.

01:09:53.493 --> 01:09:55.283
- Bye, Pob.
- See you later, folks.

01:09:55.326 --> 01:09:57.862
- Come on, Puke.
- See you later, Puke.

01:09:58.951 --> 01:10:01.275
You're a twat, mate!
You're a fucking w...

01:10:02.285 --> 01:10:04.074
See you later. Have a good night.

01:10:04.118 --> 01:10:06.571
If only you knew.

01:10:11.701 --> 01:10:13.526
Happy birthday, Smell.

01:10:13.576 --> 01:10:15.531
- Smell!
- What's that?

01:10:15.576 --> 01:10:17.034
Porno?

01:10:17.077 --> 01:10:19.315
What are you giving her porno for,
Meggy?

01:10:19.368 --> 01:10:21.691
She's a woman.
She's got her own nipples.

01:10:21.743 --> 01:10:23.532
I thought she might like it.

01:10:23.576 --> 01:10:25.365
Smell, are you ready?

01:10:25.451 --> 01:10:27.028
The er... magicians.

01:10:27.077 --> 01:10:28.533
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

01:10:28.576 --> 01:10:30.946
Three... two... one.

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:32.984
Alakazam! Yeah!

01:10:33.035 --> 01:10:35.026
- Alaka... Alakazam.
- Alakazam.

01:10:35.077 --> 01:10:36.533
Wahey!

01:10:37.743 --> 01:10:39.734
Happy birthday, Smell.

01:10:39.785 --> 01:10:41.360
Happy...

01:10:42.368 --> 01:10:44.405
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

01:10:44.451 --> 01:10:47.532
- Do you want me to put it on the table?
- Yeah, please.

01:10:47.576 --> 01:10:51.273
- Here you are. Put that on the table.
- Cheers, love, thanks.

01:10:51.326 --> 01:10:54.029
You don't mind us coming, do you, Smell?
It's just...

01:10:54.077 --> 01:10:58.117
My little man, here, wanted to surprise you
on your birthday and all that.

01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.736
Happy birthday, Smell.

01:11:05.576 --> 01:11:07.567
Do you think my party's going all right?

01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:09.318
It's been all right, yeah.

01:11:09.368 --> 01:11:11.358
Better if Woody was here.

01:11:11.409 --> 01:11:14.360
Yeah, I know, man.
I don't know why they left.

01:11:14.409 --> 01:11:16.447
They just kind of got up and went.

01:11:16.493 --> 01:11:19.491
I don't think Woody was standing
any of it from Combo.

01:11:20.493 --> 01:11:24.237
I mean, I don't know what's going on
with those two,

01:11:24.284 --> 01:11:26.239
but there's some real tension.

01:11:26.284 --> 01:11:29.069
I can sense some real tension
between them.

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:31.109
Was you happy when you saw me?

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.439
Yeah.

01:11:32.493 --> 01:11:34.649
I liked it when you gave me that cake.

01:11:34.701 --> 01:11:36.491
I thought it was cool.

01:11:36.534 --> 01:11:38.158
Did you make it?

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:40.155
Yeah.

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:43.115
- You didn't, did you?
- No.

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:44.700
I didn't think you did.

01:11:44.743 --> 01:11:47.030
Did you buy it?

01:11:47.077 --> 01:11:48.902
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you bought it.

01:11:50.534 --> 01:11:52.858
But what did you think to the other night?

01:11:53.993 --> 01:11:55.948
Yeah.

01:11:55.993 --> 01:11:59.358
Do you know what I'm on about?
In the shed and stuff.

01:11:59.451 --> 01:12:01.028
Yeah, that was...

01:12:01.077 --> 01:12:02.866
It was all right, yeah.

01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:04.817
Did you not think much to it?

01:12:04.868 --> 01:12:06.277
Oh, yeah.

01:12:07.368 --> 01:12:09.158
It was really nice.

01:12:09.243 --> 01:12:12.028
You know when I asked you
to suck my tits and stuff,

01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:15.113
I just thought
that you weren't that into it.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:18.774
I only didn't suck your tits
cos I've never done it before.

01:12:18.826 --> 01:12:22.488
I thought you'd seen a pair of tits
in Germany or summat.

01:12:22.535 --> 01:12:24.739
No, I've seen a pair of tits, but...

01:12:24.785 --> 01:12:26.360
I didn't suck 'em.

01:12:26.451 --> 01:12:27.481
Oh.

01:12:29.701 --> 01:12:30.898
Right.

01:12:31.701 --> 01:12:35.197
That's why then, isn't it?
It's not cos you didn't want to or anything?

01:12:35.243 --> 01:12:36.700
Yeah, I just...

01:12:36.743 --> 01:12:39.658
Cos I bet you've had
loads of boys doing it and...

01:12:40.618 --> 01:12:43.107
I felt a bit embarrassed
just in case I couldn't do it.

01:12:43.159 --> 01:12:44.154
Yeah.

01:12:44.243 --> 01:12:46.862
Not that many people have done it to me.

01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:48.901
I just thought it'd be nice, like.

01:12:48.952 --> 01:12:50.942
It'd make us feel closer and stuff.

01:12:52.035 --> 01:12:53.492
I was...

01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:55.276
meaning to ask you.

01:12:57.035 --> 01:13:00.447
This might seem a bit daft,
but will you be my girlfriend?

01:13:01.785 --> 01:13:03.443
Honestly?

01:13:06.701 --> 01:13:08.739
Yeah, I'd love to be.

01:13:08.785 --> 01:13:10.491
It'd be really nice.

01:13:10.535 --> 01:13:14.315
Cos I've been thinking about it, as well,
but I didn't think you'd ever ask me.

01:13:14.368 --> 01:13:18.907
I thought it'd just be, like, a one time,
off in the shed or whatever.

01:13:18.952 --> 01:13:20.693
Will you be all right for...

01:13:20.743 --> 01:13:23.278
them lot to know,
if you're not embarrassed?

01:13:24.284 --> 01:13:26.275
Cos I'm not embarrassed.

01:13:26.326 --> 01:13:27.903
I think you're lovely.

01:13:34.284 --> 01:13:38.527
<i>to maintain peace,
with freedom and justice is always expensive.</i>

01:13:38.576 --> 01:13:42.073
<i>It's less expensive than war,
particularly in human life.</i>

01:13:42.118 --> 01:13:45.899
<i>Might there be a time when we talk
to the Argentines again?</i>

01:13:45.952 --> 01:13:48.784
<i>No. Not on sovereignty.</i>

01:13:48.827 --> 01:13:51.659
<i>One thing... the islanders
have made it perfectly clear,</i>

01:13:51.701 --> 01:13:53.407
<i>these islands are British.</i>

01:13:53.451 --> 01:13:56.200
<i>They are the Queen's loyal subjects.</i>

01:13:56.243 --> 01:13:58.233
<i>They wish it to stay that way.</i>

01:13:58.284 --> 01:14:01.485
<i>At least the weather's been on
Mrs Thatcher's side...</i>

01:14:12.035 --> 01:14:14.653
- Lol.
- For fuck's sake.

01:14:14.701 --> 01:14:16.491
Where are you off? Court?

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:17.732
No. I...

01:14:17.785 --> 01:14:19.740
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to you.

01:14:19.785 --> 01:14:21.941
- Well, I'm late for work.
- Just two minutes?

01:14:21.993 --> 01:14:24.149
- I haven't got two minutes.
- All right, Lol?

01:14:24.201 --> 01:14:25.991
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:14:26.034 --> 01:14:27.658
- Hi, Lol.
- Hiya.

01:14:27.701 --> 01:14:29.573
For fu... I'm going to work.

01:14:29.618 --> 01:14:32.651
- Please, Lol. Two minutes.
- What do you wanna talk to me about?

01:14:32.701 --> 01:14:34.407
- Stuff.
- Stuff?

01:14:34.451 --> 01:14:37.734
- You wanna talk to me about stuff?
- I just wanna have a chat with you.

01:14:37.785 --> 01:14:40.071
About the fact you've just
come out of prison?

01:14:40.118 --> 01:14:43.151
You've ruined everything?
You've broken Woody's fucking heart?

01:14:43.201 --> 01:14:46.649
You wanna talk to me about stuff?
Well, I can't fucking wait. Let's go.

01:14:46.701 --> 01:14:48.573
I want to talk about other stuff.

01:14:48.618 --> 01:14:52.065
Other stuff? What other stuff
have you possibly got to say to me?

01:14:52.118 --> 01:14:54.274
Could I just have fucking two minutes
with you?

01:14:54.326 --> 01:14:57.359
No, I'm going to work.
I'm not your fucking counsellor, Combo.

01:14:57.410 --> 01:15:00.526
- I'll come back at dinner time, then.
- No, don't come back.

01:15:00.576 --> 01:15:02.484
I'll come to yours later on.

01:15:02.535 --> 01:15:04.858
To mine?
You can have two minutes now.

01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:06.699
You've got two fucking minutes.

01:15:06.743 --> 01:15:08.319
OK. Sound.

01:15:20.618 --> 01:15:23.189
Come on, then. I'm late for work.

01:15:28.118 --> 01:15:30.607
There's something for you
in the glove box.

01:15:39.993 --> 01:15:41.402
A box.

01:15:43.410 --> 01:15:45.400
You make this when you was in prison?

01:15:45.451 --> 01:15:46.482
Yeah.

01:15:48.993 --> 01:15:50.402
Thanks.

01:15:54.785 --> 01:15:56.158
Lol...

01:15:57.243 --> 01:15:58.238
Erm...

01:16:00.785 --> 01:16:03.487
Since that night that we spent together,

01:16:03.535 --> 01:16:05.691
before I went inside...

01:16:06.702 --> 01:16:09.569
...I haven't been able to think about
anything else.

01:16:10.785 --> 01:16:12.194
No, I haven't.

01:16:12.243 --> 01:16:14.732
I haven't been able
to get you out of my mind, man.

01:16:16.284 --> 01:16:18.275
And, to be honest with you, Lol...

01:16:19.285 --> 01:16:21.109
...just thinking of you...

01:16:22.201 --> 01:16:24.950
...got me through
them three and a half years inside.

01:16:26.368 --> 01:16:27.778
I mean...

01:16:28.785 --> 01:16:30.776
That was the best night of my life.

01:16:32.785 --> 01:16:34.776
It was the worst night of my life.

01:16:36.785 --> 01:16:38.063
Why?

01:16:38.118 --> 01:16:41.780
I have done nothing but try and forget
about that night, Combo.

01:16:44.285 --> 01:16:46.074
It was... It was beautiful.

01:16:46.118 --> 01:16:47.741
No, I was 16.

01:16:47.785 --> 01:16:49.940
I was pissed off my head.

01:16:50.951 --> 01:16:52.777
It wasn't beautiful.

01:16:56.410 --> 01:16:57.902
I love you, Lol.

01:16:58.993 --> 01:16:59.987
What?

01:17:04.034 --> 01:17:05.314
I've...

01:17:06.702 --> 01:17:08.491
I've always loved you.

01:17:09.577 --> 01:17:11.567
It's never gonna happen, Combo.

01:17:20.827 --> 01:17:22.449
Are we done?

01:17:22.493 --> 01:17:23.488
Yeah.

01:17:27.909 --> 01:17:29.486
There's your box.

01:18:04.410 --> 01:18:06.531
Pressure Drop

01:18:12.118 --> 01:18:13.741
# Pressure

01:18:13.785 --> 01:18:15.491
# Oh, pressure

01:18:15.535 --> 01:18:17.525
# Pressure's gonna drop on you

01:18:17.577 --> 01:18:19.567
Why do they call you Smell?

01:18:20.618 --> 01:18:24.066
It's kind of similar to Michelle,
if you think about it.

01:18:24.118 --> 01:18:27.116
I don't know, really,
if I'm being honest with you.

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:29.613
- Ah, that's fine.
- It's not cos I'm smelly.

01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:32.065
It's just Michelle and Smell.

01:18:32.118 --> 01:18:34.108
- Right.
- Purely cos it rhymes.

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:37.027
Well, it sort of rhymes, doesn't it?
Does it rhyme?

01:18:37.118 --> 01:18:38.576
R for Rectum.

01:18:39.577 --> 01:18:40.950
Rabbit.

01:18:41.951 --> 01:18:43.942
Rub your rectum.

01:18:43.993 --> 01:18:46.564
- Oh, rabbit, you said, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:18:46.618 --> 01:18:48.360
Furry rectum.

01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:50.733
Do you reckon
they've got a cassette player?

01:18:51.743 --> 01:18:53.319
- Yeah, probably.
- Really?

01:18:53.368 --> 01:18:55.359
- Yeah, probably.
- Oh, I hope so.

01:18:55.410 --> 01:18:57.531
Let's bang some music into their ears.

01:18:57.577 --> 01:18:59.152
That'll be good.

01:19:03.702 --> 01:19:06.106
- Is this it?
- Yeah, I can walk straight in.

01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:08.112
Combo!

01:19:09.951 --> 01:19:11.741
That was nice, that was.

01:19:11.784 --> 01:19:13.740
Yeah, well, you know.

01:19:13.784 --> 01:19:15.408
I do what I do.

01:19:16.410 --> 01:19:17.783
You do!

01:19:17.826 --> 01:19:19.319
Oh, fuck.

01:19:20.243 --> 01:19:22.234
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

01:19:22.285 --> 01:19:24.571
- All right, Milks?
- What are you saying, mate?

01:19:24.618 --> 01:19:26.111
How are you doing?

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.154
Sound.

01:19:27.201 --> 01:19:28.907
What have you two been up to?

01:19:28.951 --> 01:19:31.191
You know how it is, having a bit of fun.

01:19:35.742 --> 01:19:37.533
What's up, mate?

01:19:38.535 --> 01:19:39.908
You look down.

01:19:39.951 --> 01:19:41.942
One of them days.
You know what I mean?

01:19:42.951 --> 01:19:44.361
Look, man, erm...

01:19:45.368 --> 01:19:46.991
Any chance you can get me any weed?

01:19:47.951 --> 01:19:50.440
I just want a smoke.
You know what I mean?

01:19:51.285 --> 01:19:53.951
I mean, I've only got, like,
one spliff left on me.

01:19:53.993 --> 01:19:55.983
I can't really give that away.

01:19:56.034 --> 01:19:58.736
- What were you after?
- About an ounce or summat.

01:19:58.784 --> 01:20:00.242
Fucking hell.

01:20:00.285 --> 01:20:01.741
No, mate, no.

01:20:01.784 --> 01:20:04.356
I couldn't get anything like that big, no way.

01:20:04.410 --> 01:20:07.739
I mean, I'll give you half, I'll split it.
Give you half of it.

01:20:08.784 --> 01:20:10.775
Well, I mean, I might be able to...

01:20:11.784 --> 01:20:13.575
...to get... get like that much.

01:20:13.618 --> 01:20:15.027
What?

01:20:16.410 --> 01:20:17.405
What?

01:20:18.201 --> 01:20:20.192
I thought you were gonna
walk me home.

01:20:20.243 --> 01:20:23.940
You can be there in, like, 15 minutes,
if you get a move on now.

01:20:25.034 --> 01:20:27.025
You're only a mile down the road.

01:20:27.076 --> 01:20:28.699
Are you joking?

01:20:28.743 --> 01:20:29.737
What?

01:20:30.951 --> 01:20:33.618
Oh, fuck you, you selfish bastard.

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:39.782
Fuckin' hell, man.

01:20:41.118 --> 01:20:42.907
Women!

01:20:44.784 --> 01:20:46.775
Ooh-ooh-ooh!

01:20:46.826 --> 01:20:48.450
Watch it.

01:20:48.493 --> 01:20:50.697
- Banjo for a banjo.
- Yeah.

01:20:53.493 --> 01:20:54.488
Ah.

01:20:54.535 --> 01:20:56.158
Ooh-ooh-ooh!

01:20:56.201 --> 01:20:58.192
- Come on, Smell.
Oh, no.

01:20:58.243 --> 01:21:01.738
- Come on.
- Oh, God! It's gonna keel over!

01:21:01.784 --> 01:21:03.361
Wait for it.

01:21:06.743 --> 01:21:08.733
- Kick Donkey!
- Two sugars.

01:21:08.784 --> 01:21:10.194
Kick Donkey.

01:21:10.243 --> 01:21:13.822
I'm not making tea.
Kick Donkey, Kick Donkey...

01:21:21.493 --> 01:21:23.484
Anyone got a problem?

01:21:23.535 --> 01:21:24.992
No problem.

01:21:28.617 --> 01:21:30.608
No. Problem with what, man?

01:21:32.035 --> 01:21:34.605
Good to see you, Milk.
Are you all right, mate?

01:21:35.368 --> 01:21:37.110
All right, Tubbs.

01:21:38.909 --> 01:21:40.486
Is Woody on his way?

01:21:40.535 --> 01:21:42.111
No. Just Milky.

01:21:44.243 --> 01:21:46.945
- All right, Milks?
- Are you all right, mate?

01:22:04.951 --> 01:22:06.326
No problem.

01:22:07.410 --> 01:22:09.116
Sit down, Milks.

01:22:12.535 --> 01:22:13.992
That's good.

01:22:14.993 --> 01:22:16.984
That means we can all get stoned.

01:22:19.743 --> 01:22:22.906
# At the dark end...

01:22:22.951 --> 01:22:24.528
A chocolate bassline.

01:22:24.576 --> 01:22:26.566
# Of the street...

01:22:26.618 --> 01:22:28.408
All velvet.

01:22:28.452 --> 01:22:32.694
# That's where we always meet...

01:22:32.743 --> 01:22:34.733
Combo. My dancing buddy.

01:22:34.784 --> 01:22:37.699
# Hiding in shadows

01:22:37.743 --> 01:22:40.824
# Where we don't belong

01:22:42.618 --> 01:22:47.903
# Living in darkness
to hide our wrong...

01:22:49.618 --> 01:22:51.608
# You and me...

01:22:51.701 --> 01:22:53.360
Sit, Mitzy, sit.

01:22:54.368 --> 01:22:58.575
# At the dark end of the street...

01:22:58.618 --> 01:23:00.075
I'm hot, I'm hot!

01:23:00.118 --> 01:23:02.606
# You and me...

01:23:04.118 --> 01:23:05.113
Ow!

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:09.733
# I know time's gonna take its toll...

01:23:10.743 --> 01:23:12.568
Are you all right, Gads?

01:23:12.618 --> 01:23:15.107
# We have to pay for the love...

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:17.778
Take him home, love. He looks fucked.

01:23:20.118 --> 01:23:22.523
# It's a sin and we know...

01:23:22.576 --> 01:23:24.283
It's all right, Gadge, lad.

01:23:25.285 --> 01:23:27.359
Have you fucking seen how white he is!

01:23:27.410 --> 01:23:30.028
I've never seen anyone
look that fucking sick!

01:23:31.035 --> 01:23:33.025
That fucking kid's arse went white!

01:23:34.035 --> 01:23:36.025
#... steal away...

01:23:37.035 --> 01:23:38.314
Come on.

01:23:38.368 --> 01:23:40.738
# To the dark end

01:23:40.784 --> 01:23:42.905
# Of the street...

01:23:42.951 --> 01:23:44.279
Oh, man.

01:23:44.327 --> 01:23:45.819
Here you are.

01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:47.817
No, seriously, Combo, man.

01:23:48.951 --> 01:23:52.234
I've got to tell you, mate,
you're a good geezer, man.

01:23:52.285 --> 01:23:54.690
Seriously. I mean, this... this music,

01:23:54.743 --> 01:23:59.945
this sort of music is the sort of stuff
that I listen to, my uncles listen to.

01:23:59.993 --> 01:24:02.825
Yeah, to me, this is good music.

01:24:02.910 --> 01:24:07.567
What you've gotta remember, Milks,
right, is... is I'm an original skinhead.

01:24:07.618 --> 01:24:09.111
'69, me.

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:14.113
But it was people like your uncle,
your uncle that introduced that stuff to me.

01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:17.360
The soul of that music
just fucking resonated within us,

01:24:17.410 --> 01:24:19.068
do you know what I mean?

01:24:19.118 --> 01:24:23.064
And it's people... it's skinheads, like you,
true skinheads, like you,

01:24:23.118 --> 01:24:24.908
keeping that flame alive.

01:24:24.951 --> 01:24:27.156
Yeah. It was fucking unity.

01:24:27.202 --> 01:24:29.868
It was black and white, together.
Know what I mean?

01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:32.399
It should not be forgotten.
It shouldn't die.

01:24:32.451 --> 01:24:36.113
You're still flying that flag in that fucking
get-out that you're wearing.

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.569
It's proper.

01:24:37.618 --> 01:24:39.075
It's real, man.

01:24:39.118 --> 01:24:40.445
Oh, man.

01:24:41.451 --> 01:24:44.118
That's it, man,
we're like brothers now. Yeah?

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.238
Serious.

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.151
- For life.
- Yeah, for life.

01:24:48.202 --> 01:24:49.742
Nice one, Combo.

01:24:49.785 --> 01:24:51.326
Hand the spliff over.

01:24:51.368 --> 01:24:54.153
I haven't had a laugh like this
for fucking years.

01:24:54.202 --> 01:24:55.575
- Serious.
- For years.

01:24:55.618 --> 01:24:57.822
Here you are. It's been a long time.

01:25:00.202 --> 01:25:02.192
I want some chocolate.

01:25:06.826 --> 01:25:10.239
- There's biscuits in the cupboard.
- Not in that cupboard.

01:25:12.243 --> 01:25:14.447
No, not in that cupboard. I'm starving!

01:25:14.493 --> 01:25:17.989
How can you fucking live like this?
There's not even a mouldy Twiglet.

01:25:19.118 --> 01:25:22.566
I'm really starving, man.
I've got the munchies badly.

01:25:22.618 --> 01:25:25.402
- Combo, have you eaten the biscuits?
- No.

01:25:25.451 --> 01:25:28.236
- Fucking hell.
What a night.

01:25:30.701 --> 01:25:32.692
So, how many uncles have you got?

01:25:32.743 --> 01:25:33.987
Erm...

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:38.489
I've got three uncles and two aunties.

01:25:38.534 --> 01:25:40.193
So, a big family, then.

01:25:40.243 --> 01:25:41.274
Yeah.

01:25:42.327 --> 01:25:46.155
I've got... What is it? 22 cousins.

01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.730
One uncle's got, what, seven kids.

01:25:50.785 --> 01:25:52.775
What, to the same woman, like?

01:25:52.826 --> 01:25:54.106
Nah.

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:56.648
Spread out
between three different women.

01:25:56.701 --> 01:26:00.944
One's got two, the other's got two,
and another one's got three kids.

01:26:00.993 --> 01:26:04.074
And he just, like,
left these families and fucked off?

01:26:04.118 --> 01:26:06.653
Nah, he still sees 'em.

01:26:06.701 --> 01:26:09.155
Yeah, to me,
he still spends time with them.

01:26:09.202 --> 01:26:13.989
They're always round at Christmas
and stuff like that. We all get together.

01:26:14.035 --> 01:26:16.321
A big party till late in the morning.

01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:20.151
Yeah, it's... it's nice.

01:26:20.202 --> 01:26:22.986
It is. It's nice having a big family.

01:26:23.035 --> 01:26:24.741
Have you got a mum and dad?

01:26:24.785 --> 01:26:27.155
Cos you haven't talked about
your mum or dad.

01:26:28.243 --> 01:26:30.115
Yeah, I've got a mum and dad.

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:31.617
Of course, man.

01:26:31.701 --> 01:26:34.485
A good mum and dad.
Yeah, I can't knock 'em at all.

01:26:35.202 --> 01:26:39.942
I was one of them kids where...
my dad was away all the time.

01:26:39.993 --> 01:26:43.110
Sometimes he was away for, like,
a fortnight, working.

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.238
But...

01:26:45.243 --> 01:26:49.402
I never blamed my dad or anything
like that for him being away and working.

01:26:49.451 --> 01:26:50.446
Cos...

01:26:50.493 --> 01:26:52.946
there was always food on that table.

01:26:52.993 --> 01:26:55.398
That's what I respect that man for.

01:26:55.451 --> 01:26:56.825
Always.

01:26:58.826 --> 01:27:00.817
Lucky you, aren't you?

01:27:00.910 --> 01:27:02.402
I tell you...

01:27:02.451 --> 01:27:04.442
you know, any, any time...

01:27:05.451 --> 01:27:07.655
...you wanna come round
for something to eat,

01:27:07.701 --> 01:27:10.699
you have to come to my grandma's
to get something to eat.

01:27:10.743 --> 01:27:12.449
- Yeah?
- Yeah, man.

01:27:12.493 --> 01:27:15.693
She'll cook some rice.
She'll cook some peas.

01:27:15.743 --> 01:27:17.983
She'll cook some chicken.

01:27:18.035 --> 01:27:20.072
She sounds dead lovely, don't she?

01:27:20.118 --> 01:27:23.530
Serious, man, then you come home
for some ackee and swordfish.

01:27:24.534 --> 01:27:26.324
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

01:27:26.368 --> 01:27:28.158
Ah, seriously, man, cos...

01:27:28.202 --> 01:27:33.072
I'd love for you to do that.
I'd love for you to do that. That'd be nice.

01:27:33.118 --> 01:27:37.574
Serious, come and see how we...
how we live. Know what I mean?

01:27:37.618 --> 01:27:40.284
Even on a bad day,
there'll probably be...

01:27:40.326 --> 01:27:42.649
a couple of my uncles
and about seven...

01:27:42.701 --> 01:27:45.272
Fucking hell.
You've got everything, haven't you?

01:27:45.326 --> 01:27:47.152
- What?
- You've got the whole lot.

01:27:48.202 --> 01:27:50.441
You've got the whole fucking
perfect package.

01:27:51.785 --> 01:27:53.159
Fucking hell.

01:27:54.993 --> 01:27:56.735
Got everything, you, didn't you?

01:27:58.743 --> 01:28:01.149
Fucking hell, man. So...

01:28:02.493 --> 01:28:05.444
What... What do you think
makes a bad dad?

01:28:08.035 --> 01:28:10.784
I don't know, mate. I'm not a dad, am I?

01:28:12.576 --> 01:28:14.567
I know you had a good dad, like, but,

01:28:14.618 --> 01:28:18.991
be honest with me, what do you really think
makes a bad dad, though?

01:28:19.035 --> 01:28:20.907
I don't know, man.

01:28:20.952 --> 01:28:22.942
What's with the questions, man?

01:28:22.993 --> 01:28:25.316
I feel like I'm being interrogated.

01:28:28.618 --> 01:28:30.739
What do you reckon?

01:28:31.743 --> 01:28:32.738
Niggers.

01:28:35.576 --> 01:28:38.574
- What's with the "nigger"?
- Because you are, aren't you?

01:28:38.618 --> 01:28:41.107
You're a fucking nigger. Aren't you?

01:28:44.326 --> 01:28:45.605
Aren't you?

01:28:46.952 --> 01:28:48.907
Fucking coon.

01:28:48.952 --> 01:28:51.274
Combo! Just leave him.

01:28:54.785 --> 01:28:56.158
Go on.

01:28:58.785 --> 01:29:00.775
Don't fucking smile at me.

01:29:00.826 --> 01:29:02.449
Don't smile at me.

01:29:02.493 --> 01:29:04.448
Milky, just stop smiling at him, please.

01:29:04.493 --> 01:29:08.902
Don't fucking smile at me, cos I'll wipe
the fucking smile off your fucking face.

01:29:08.952 --> 01:29:10.658
Yeah? You fucking cunt!

01:29:11.243 --> 01:29:13.696
No!
- Fucking horrible...

01:29:13.743 --> 01:29:16.492
Fucking bastard!

01:29:18.368 --> 01:29:20.939
I fucking hate you! I fucking hate you!

01:29:20.993 --> 01:29:23.197
- I fucking hate you!
Get off!

01:29:23.243 --> 01:29:24.736
Milky!

01:29:24.785 --> 01:29:27.403
- No, Combo, get off him!
- You fucking black bastard!

01:29:28.493 --> 01:29:30.567
I fucking hate you! I fucking hate you.

01:29:30.618 --> 01:29:32.822
I fucking hate you! You fucking nigger!

01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:34.367
- You fucking nigger!
- Milky!

01:29:34.409 --> 01:29:37.158
Fuck off! Fuck off!

01:29:37.201 --> 01:29:39.571
Combo!

01:29:39.618 --> 01:29:40.566
Milky!

01:29:40.618 --> 01:29:42.739
Milky, man, are you all right?

01:29:42.785 --> 01:29:44.064
Shut up!

01:29:44.117 --> 01:29:46.737
Shut the fuck up
and get the fuck out now!

01:29:46.785 --> 01:29:48.574
You little fucking cunt.

01:29:48.618 --> 01:29:51.024
Fuck off, you little bastard!

01:29:51.117 --> 01:29:54.069
- I thought you was winding us up.
- What are you doing, boys?

01:29:54.117 --> 01:29:57.530
Fucking all day
we've sat and listened to him.

01:29:57.576 --> 01:29:59.282
I want some of this. We want our bit.

01:29:59.326 --> 01:30:00.736
This man?

01:30:00.785 --> 01:30:02.775
- Aargh!
- You fucking mad cunt!

01:30:02.827 --> 01:30:05.694
You knobhead!
You fucking horrible fucking cunt!

01:30:05.743 --> 01:30:08.611
You're fucking mad as a March hare.
What's wrong with you?

01:30:08.701 --> 01:30:10.526
Fucking leave them alone!

01:30:10.576 --> 01:30:13.243
- Do you want it, as well?
- You're fucking potty.

01:30:13.284 --> 01:30:15.571
What? Fuck off, you fucking dickhead!

01:30:15.618 --> 01:30:18.901
I'll fucking throttle you,
you fucking fat piece of shit!

01:30:18.952 --> 01:30:22.447
Get the fuck out of here,
you fucking goggle-eyed twat!

01:30:23.618 --> 01:30:25.443
Get out. Get out.

01:30:25.493 --> 01:30:28.195
- You need to fucking see someone.
- Get out.

01:30:28.243 --> 01:30:30.233
I said, get out. I said, get out.

01:30:30.284 --> 01:30:31.279
Milky...

01:30:31.326 --> 01:30:34.739
Leave them alone, will you?
They haven't done nothing to you.

01:30:34.785 --> 01:30:36.740
Fucking leave them two alone.

01:30:36.785 --> 01:30:38.277
Leave them alone.

01:30:38.326 --> 01:30:40.897
They've done...
They've done nothing to you.

01:30:40.952 --> 01:30:42.360
You fuck...

01:30:44.118 --> 01:30:45.065
Ah!

01:30:46.785 --> 01:30:48.574
No-o-o!

01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:57.282
Fucking hell.

01:30:57.326 --> 01:30:58.784
I'm sorry.

01:30:58.827 --> 01:31:00.817
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:31:01.535 --> 01:31:03.276
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:31:06.410 --> 01:31:08.899
Oh, Combo,
what have you done to him?

01:31:08.952 --> 01:31:10.741
Oh, my God!

01:31:10.785 --> 01:31:12.361
No, no, no!

01:31:15.535 --> 01:31:16.529
Milky?

01:31:16.576 --> 01:31:18.152
Wake up, Milky!

01:31:18.201 --> 01:31:19.659
He's OK.

01:31:19.701 --> 01:31:21.443
Milky, wake up!

01:31:21.493 --> 01:31:23.899
Hey, what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

01:31:25.284 --> 01:31:27.608
It's not my fault. I didn't mean it.

01:31:28.618 --> 01:31:30.692
I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it.

01:31:31.618 --> 01:31:33.739
- Milky, wake up!
- Help me get him...

01:31:33.785 --> 01:31:35.941
- Wake up!
- Help me get him to hospital.

01:31:35.993 --> 01:31:38.564
- Help me get him to hospital.
- Get off! Milky!

01:31:38.618 --> 01:31:40.656
Come on, now. Stop it, now.

01:31:40.702 --> 01:31:43.902
Stop the crying.
The crying stops now. You don't cry.

01:31:43.952 --> 01:31:45.741
Real men don't cry.

01:31:45.785 --> 01:31:48.154
Help me get him to the hospital, OK?

01:31:48.201 --> 01:31:49.778
Come on. Let's go.

01:31:49.827 --> 01:31:51.864
Come on, Shaun. Come on. Let's go.

01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:53.486
Come on. Come on.

01:32:07.284 --> 01:32:09.275
OK. Come on. Come on.

01:32:09.326 --> 01:32:11.317
Help me. Help me. Stop crying!

01:32:11.368 --> 01:32:13.109
Don't look at his face.

01:32:13.159 --> 01:32:15.731
Don't look at his face.
Don't look at his face.

01:32:15.785 --> 01:32:17.574
Don't look at his face.

01:34:41.285 --> 01:34:42.315
Shaun?

01:34:44.951 --> 01:34:46.492
Can I come in?

01:34:47.618 --> 01:34:48.814
Yeah.

01:35:01.577 --> 01:35:03.567
It's my favourite picture of Dad.

01:35:06.285 --> 01:35:07.694
Me too.

01:35:12.034 --> 01:35:13.528
And that one.

01:35:14.784 --> 01:35:16.740
Mm, yeah, that's really nice.

01:35:16.784 --> 01:35:18.905
You really look alike on that one.

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:27.908
Do you remember where we were
in that one?

01:35:32.118 --> 01:35:33.148
Where?

01:35:33.201 --> 01:35:34.445
Goy Farms.

01:35:35.451 --> 01:35:37.821
That was like the best holiday ever.

01:35:53.702 --> 01:35:56.272
Milky's gonna be all right, Shaun,
I promise.

01:36:04.702 --> 01:36:06.491
Shaun, are you OK?

01:36:19.326 --> 01:36:20.606
Yeah.

01:36:26.743 --> 01:36:29.776
Please Please Please
Let Me Get What I Want

01:36:47.368 --> 01:36:49.608
# Good times, for a change

01:36:53.909 --> 01:36:55.900
# See, the luck I've had

01:36:56.951 --> 01:36:59.949
# Can make a good man turn bad

01:37:03.493 --> 01:37:05.484
# So, please

01:37:05.951 --> 01:37:07.575
# Please, please

01:37:08.909 --> 01:37:12.192
# Let me, let me, let me

01:37:12.243 --> 01:37:14.234
# Let me

01:37:15.577 --> 01:37:17.366
# Get what I want

01:37:18.368 --> 01:37:19.825
# This time

01:37:25.118 --> 01:37:27.109
# Get what I want

01:37:30.285 --> 01:37:31.777
# This time

01:37:42.201 --> 01:37:45.402
# Haven't had a dream in a long time

01:37:49.410 --> 01:37:51.401
# See, the life I've had

01:37:52.701 --> 01:37:55.486
# Can make a good man bad
