WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:03.537
We are very different
people and it's not

00:03.570 --> 00:04.772
like you could ever go anywhere.

00:04.805 --> 00:06.774
Doc, I'm not saying
I want to marry you.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.109
All I'm saying is

00:08.141 --> 00:09.510
there's something here.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.112
Lemon, I cannot marry you,

00:11.145 --> 00:12.546
not when a part of me is
in love with someone else.

00:12.580 --> 00:13.781
George's heart
needs time to heal.

00:13.814 --> 00:15.116
And meanwhile, you just

00:15.149 --> 00:16.650
keep getting freaky with Wade.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.786
I've decided to run
against you for mayor.

00:18.819 --> 00:20.388
I couldn't afford
to move out on my own.

00:20.421 --> 00:21.389
You want an apartment?

00:21.422 --> 00:22.690
Move on to this houseboat.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.292
Lemon Breeland's
living on a boat?

00:24.325 --> 00:26.527
How badly do you want
to beat Rudy Jeffries for mayor?

00:26.560 --> 00:27.695
Let me run your campaign.

00:27.728 --> 00:30.131
You will be unbeatable.

00:36.704 --> 00:37.838
ZOE: Wow.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.540
No, you were right.
I was wrong.

00:39.573 --> 00:42.276
Under the table is better
than on the table.

00:42.310 --> 00:45.646
Well, I just thought if you were
the heroic World War II pilot,

00:45.679 --> 00:47.581
and I was the naughty
Air Force medic,

00:47.615 --> 00:48.682
we would probably have
to protect ourselves

00:48.716 --> 00:50.118
from any bombing.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.152
No, I get it.
It's very well thought-out.

00:51.185 --> 00:53.087
Yeah, the best part is

00:53.121 --> 00:56.090
this whole "no strings" thing
we've got going on.

00:56.124 --> 00:57.558
I mean, I don't have to obsess
whether you're going to call.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.127
I don't have to call.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.528
I don't have to hear
about your day,

01:00.561 --> 01:01.795
or worse, your car.
And I don't have

01:01.829 --> 01:05.433
to hear about your new shoes or
what you ate for lunch, it's...

01:05.465 --> 01:06.434
God, it's great.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.136
It's amazing.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.803
Why didn't anyone ever tell
me about casual sex before?

01:09.837 --> 01:12.673
It is odd they didn't teach
a course on this in med school.

01:12.706 --> 01:13.807
(gasps)

01:13.841 --> 01:16.844
Hey, tonight, let's be strangers
that meet on a train.

01:16.877 --> 01:17.778
Train?

01:17.811 --> 01:19.447
Who travels by train anymore?

01:19.480 --> 01:20.448
What are we, hobos?

01:20.481 --> 01:22.383
Yes, Wade, we're hobos.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.717
Sexy hobos
on a train.

01:23.751 --> 01:26.220
Yeesh. Be at the station,

01:26.254 --> 01:27.455
or don't be;
it's up to you.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.290
I'm casual.

01:30.858 --> 01:33.761
And there you have it,
my fabulous new floating home.

01:33.794 --> 01:36.130
So, the dining room is also
the living room and the kitchen.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.565
Well, that is convenient.

01:37.598 --> 01:38.899
Can I houseboat-sit

01:38.932 --> 01:40.468
when you go out of town?

01:40.501 --> 01:42.403
Wait, when are you
going out of town?

01:42.436 --> 01:43.771
You are not having
parties on my boat.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.706
I know.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.875
How far is international
waters from here?

01:47.908 --> 01:49.877
Are you sure you can
handle her on your own?

01:49.910 --> 01:52.413
Oh, sure.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.814
Right now, I'm just giving her
the illusion

01:53.847 --> 01:55.349
that she is in control.

01:55.383 --> 01:57.518
Well, you are
very convincing.
Thank you.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.720
So, how about everything else?

01:59.753 --> 02:01.522
I mean, it is such a big house.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.591
And don't forget that Delilah's
going on vacation for two weeks.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.892
Maybe you should
get a service in.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.194
Honey, we are fine.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.528
But what about you?

02:07.561 --> 02:10.264
I mean, do you like it here?

02:10.298 --> 02:11.565
I love it.

02:11.599 --> 02:12.933
Things are really turning
around for me, Daddy.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.835
And me having my own place
is just the beginning.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.738
Today, I start my life
as a career woman,

02:17.771 --> 02:19.273
managing Lavon Hayes's campaign.

02:19.307 --> 02:23.744
Well, okay, as long
as you're happy, I am too.

02:23.777 --> 02:24.812
I miss you. That's all.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.680
I miss you too.

02:26.714 --> 02:27.781
Oh, and you'll
remind the gardener

02:27.815 --> 02:30.318
to trim back the roses and
re-fertilize the front lawn?

02:30.351 --> 02:31.952
And pick up your dry cleaning
and don't forget: you need to

02:31.985 --> 02:33.921
to lift and pull up on the dryer
door when it gets stuck and...

02:33.954 --> 02:35.856
I can run my own home, please.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.691
Magnolia.

02:37.725 --> 02:40.528
Bye, I love you.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.162
Hand 'em over.

02:44.432 --> 02:46.567
Someone should have keys.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.603
It's just good sense.

02:49.637 --> 02:50.871
(sighs)

02:50.904 --> 02:51.905
We'll be fine.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.745
Ooh, pancakes?
You read my mind.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.880
Now I know why
athletes carbo-load.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.215
You wanna know what I mean?

03:01.249 --> 03:02.550
No.
Why I'm so tired?

03:02.583 --> 03:03.951
No.
The sex.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.719
Because it's like a marathon,

03:05.753 --> 03:07.521
only no one's handing you water
every couple of miles,

03:07.555 --> 03:09.323
although that would be useful.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.824
No, no, no.

03:10.858 --> 03:11.625
I don't want to hear
any details

03:11.659 --> 03:15.463
about my friends'
athletic pursuits.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.998
Lavon, I share.
That's what I do.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.667
Besides, it's your fault

03:19.700 --> 03:21.402
that I don't have any
girlfriends to share with.

03:21.435 --> 03:22.470
My fault?
Ruby Jeffries

03:22.503 --> 03:25.306
was going to be my first
real BlueBell girlfriend.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.308
And I ruined it by making
her run against me?

03:27.341 --> 03:29.810
No, but I'm on Team Lavon.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.813
Huh, well, Team Lavon
appreciates your loyalty.

03:32.846 --> 03:36.850
And now candidate Lavon
has an election to win.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.420
Hey, can I take that syrup
to my place for later?
Yup.

03:39.453 --> 03:40.421
Wanna know why?
No.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.455
Okay.

03:43.491 --> 03:44.858
Brunch with your grandma?

03:44.892 --> 03:48.296
Yeah, that sounds...
that sounds perfect.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.864
Yup, oh, okay.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.866
All right, b-bye-bye now.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.468
It's just Shelby.

03:54.502 --> 03:55.803
The girl from BlueBellapalooza?

03:55.836 --> 03:57.004
I thought you said your
first date was a disaster.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.472
It was.

03:58.506 --> 03:59.873
Then I went to apologize

03:59.907 --> 04:01.008
and that led to a second date,
which somehow has led

04:01.041 --> 04:02.743
to a third date.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.845
All she does is talk about
online discount shopping.

04:04.878 --> 04:05.913
She keeps on sending me links

04:05.946 --> 04:08.816
for designer ties
at incredibly reduced prices.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.984
So, why are you going
to brunch at Grandma's?

04:11.018 --> 04:12.353
Because I don't know how
to break up with her

04:12.386 --> 04:13.321
without hurting
her feelings, Wade.

04:13.354 --> 04:16.423
Well...

04:16.457 --> 04:19.593
as luck would have it, you have
hit upon my area of expertise.

04:19.627 --> 04:22.563
My friend, allow me
to introduce you

04:22.596 --> 04:23.864
to "The Compliment Sandwich."

04:23.897 --> 04:24.865
Compliment Sandwich?

04:24.898 --> 04:26.934
On top, you've got your bread:

04:26.967 --> 04:28.736
Nice little piece
of flattery like, uh,

04:28.769 --> 04:31.071
(clears throat):
"Your beauty humbles

04:31.104 --> 04:32.973
a simple man like me."

04:33.006 --> 04:34.842
Then quickly get to the meat:

04:34.875 --> 04:37.545
"But you and I both know
the timing isn't right for us."

04:37.578 --> 04:38.779
And then before she
has a chance to argue,

04:38.812 --> 04:40.914
you hit her with
one final compliment:

04:40.948 --> 04:45.753
Uh, "A woman as perfect as you
deserves it all."

04:47.921 --> 04:48.922
That's a compliment sandwich.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.057
Do it.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.893
Or 15 years from now,
you'll be wearing a discount tie

04:52.926 --> 04:54.328
when you leave Shelby
at the altar.

04:54.362 --> 04:56.830
Hey.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.067
Well, it's not cancer...

05:00.100 --> 05:01.335
Mmm.

05:01.369 --> 05:02.770
...it's a mosquito bite.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.072
Oh, that's so weird.

05:05.105 --> 05:08.976
You sure? I mean, you can never
be too careful these days.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.811
You gotta... check.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.012
Okay, fine.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.681
After you blew me off
for lunch twice,

05:13.714 --> 05:15.416
I figured it was
my best chance to see you.

05:15.449 --> 05:16.984
I miss you.
Me too.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.986
But Lavon is my best friend,

05:19.019 --> 05:20.421
and you're his opponent
right now

05:20.454 --> 05:21.589
and I can't get in the middle.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.624
Okay, okay, how 'bout
some ground rules?

05:23.657 --> 05:24.725
No campaign talk allowed.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.860
Only approved topics are: boys,

05:26.894 --> 05:28.896
food, shoes, boys,

05:28.929 --> 05:32.032
ugh, the disastrous combo of
BlueBell humidity and my hair.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.734
Oh, and boys.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.969
It's very tempting, but...

05:36.003 --> 05:37.605
Then, I get to say things like,

05:37.638 --> 05:39.740
"Oh, my single cousin Zach
is coming to visit,

05:39.773 --> 05:42.142
"and he's the male version
of me, which means amazing,

05:42.175 --> 05:43.143
and you two should go out."

05:43.176 --> 05:44.144
Ruby...

05:44.177 --> 05:45.713
What?

05:45.746 --> 05:46.847
I don't think I can.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.850
I'm kind of unavailable
at the moment.

05:49.883 --> 05:50.851
What?

05:50.884 --> 05:52.720
Okay, come on.
Who? Who is it?

05:52.753 --> 05:53.721
Who are you seeing?

05:53.754 --> 05:55.589
Is it George?
Is it Wade?

05:55.623 --> 05:57.858
Is it... you know,
that's all there is.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.126
So, come on.
Spill it. Who is it?

05:59.159 --> 06:00.728
Wade.
(gasps)

06:00.761 --> 06:01.862
You're going out with Wade?

06:01.895 --> 06:02.996
Well, uh, no.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.699
I'm just kind of

06:05.733 --> 06:06.900
staying in with Wade.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.636
Ooh, delicious, all right.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.738
Okay, so if it's just sex,
then you can still meet Zach.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.973
Ruby, I just don't think
it would be right.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.876
Wade and I kind of have
this unspoken agreement

06:15.909 --> 06:18.746
where we have sex every night.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.914
An unspoken agreement
with Wade Kinsella?

06:20.948 --> 06:22.750
Honey, legend has it,
back in high school,

06:22.783 --> 06:24.918
he left senior prom with
three different guys' dates.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.019
Wade went to prom?

06:26.053 --> 06:26.987
No.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.423
Oh, wow.
Mm-hmm, mmm.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.759
Well, in high school,
he didn't have me.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.561
Trust me, he is not looking
for someone else.

06:33.594 --> 06:34.562
He is plenty happy.

06:34.595 --> 06:35.963
All right, fine, good luck.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.966
But if you change your mind,
give me a call.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.501
About Zach or me.

06:41.535 --> 06:42.503
Bye.

06:42.536 --> 06:45.773
Bye.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.741
LEMON:
 As you can see
 from my materials,

06:47.775 --> 06:49.643
I'm already making
amazing strides.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.011
Oh, yeah, the poster.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.513
Da-huh...

06:52.546 --> 06:54.181
Okay, but the
thing is, Lemon, uh...

06:54.214 --> 06:55.716
And I've almost secured one

06:55.749 --> 06:57.918
of the most influential
endorsements in BlueBell.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.921
Guess who, who, who?

07:00.954 --> 07:02.923
The Owl Club.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.592
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.861
Ruby's already won over
Frank Moth and Ashley Potts.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.964
Yes, some business members have
been lured in by her promises

07:10.998 --> 07:11.799
to "modernize" BlueBell,

07:11.832 --> 07:14.001
but as I told them,
unless they want

07:14.034 --> 07:14.902
the town gazebo
turned into a CinnaBon,

07:14.935 --> 07:17.170
modernization is
the last thing we need.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.172
So, I'm meeting with Dash
later this afternoon,

07:19.206 --> 07:20.608
and with his endorsement,

07:20.641 --> 07:21.975
I think I can reel
the rest of 'em in.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.877
The Owl endorsement
is a game-changer.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.178
Yeah, and if all goes
according to my plan,

07:25.212 --> 07:26.747
we will announce it at this.

07:26.780 --> 07:27.848
"Lavon Hayes

07:27.881 --> 07:30.584
Meat & Greet."

07:30.618 --> 07:31.885
M-e-a-t.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.721
It's a barbeque.
Get it?

07:33.754 --> 07:35.956
Oh-ho, yeah, I get it.

07:35.989 --> 07:40.260
Uh, Lemon, this is all
great stuff, uh,

07:40.293 --> 07:42.730
but you-you can't be
my campaign manager.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.031
You're firing me?

07:44.064 --> 07:45.032
I never hired you.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.867
Y-You offered to be

07:46.900 --> 07:48.602
my campaign manager;
I said I'd think about it.

07:48.636 --> 07:49.737
And I did...

07:49.770 --> 07:51.705
No, you didn't
because if you did,

07:51.739 --> 07:53.807
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

07:53.841 --> 07:54.975
I mean, you just
said yourself

07:55.008 --> 07:56.510
that the Owls were
a game-changer.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.712
This-this is not about your
ideas or your abilities.

07:58.746 --> 07:59.947
You see, it's just...

07:59.980 --> 08:02.816
uh...

08:02.850 --> 08:06.987
a working relationship
can be complicated,

08:07.020 --> 08:09.590
and given our personal history

08:09.623 --> 08:11.992
Oh, Lavon, do not tell me that
you are still in love with me.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.661
What? No.

08:13.694 --> 08:14.728
Then I don't see the problem.

08:14.762 --> 08:18.198
I just don't see us...

08:18.231 --> 08:19.733
We're not exactly friends.

08:19.767 --> 08:22.035
We tried that.
It-it-it never quite worked.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.872
So? This campaign
isn't about friends.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.907
It's about taking down
the common enemy,

08:26.940 --> 08:28.308
which is why you hired me
for this job.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.610
The thing is...

08:29.643 --> 08:32.011
Again, I didn't hire you.

08:32.044 --> 08:33.881
Lavon...

08:33.914 --> 08:36.650
I promise you
I will stop at nothing

08:36.683 --> 08:38.919
until we win this election.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.721
Just let me try.

08:40.754 --> 08:41.755
Please.

08:44.792 --> 08:45.993
(sighs)
All right.

08:46.026 --> 08:46.794
Yay!

08:46.827 --> 08:49.129
Yay. You will not
be disappointed.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.198
(grunts)

08:53.166 --> 08:54.668
WANDA:
Oh, Lemon,

08:54.702 --> 08:55.936
you okay?

08:55.969 --> 08:58.005
Oh, no, you didn't eat

08:58.038 --> 08:59.172
the special omelet, did you?

08:59.206 --> 09:00.908
I know it says
American cheese,

09:00.941 --> 09:04.845
and while Guam is technically
an American territory...

09:09.783 --> 09:14.087
*

09:25.065 --> 09:28.568
The doctor is in.

09:34.908 --> 09:38.779
What the hell?

09:41.915 --> 09:44.685
(gasps)

09:44.718 --> 09:47.721
*

10:02.269 --> 10:04.705
Want to taste, uh,
the Lavon Hayes' special sauce

10:04.738 --> 10:06.139
for my barbeque Meat & Greet?

10:06.173 --> 10:07.140
No, thanks.
I'm not hungry.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.141
Can I ask you a question?

10:08.175 --> 10:09.142
Is it about Wade?

10:09.176 --> 10:10.744
No.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.980
It's about lions.
Lions?

10:13.013 --> 10:16.316
Yeah, I was watching this nature
special last night about lions.

10:16.349 --> 10:20.253
Did you know that male lions
sleep with every lioness

10:20.287 --> 10:21.288
they can get their paws on?

10:21.321 --> 10:22.890
It's evolution.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.424
(scoffs)

10:24.457 --> 10:27.260
See, to secure the survival
of the species,

10:27.294 --> 10:29.897
the heads of every pride have
to, uh, spread their seed

10:29.930 --> 10:31.899
with as many female
members as possible.

10:31.932 --> 10:32.966
Plus, they can.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.769
Okay, I mean, fine.

10:35.803 --> 10:38.071
It's one thing for a lion
to be king of the jungle,

10:38.105 --> 10:39.973
but yo, Simba, how
about a little heads-up

10:40.007 --> 10:41.174
if there's gonna be a hot
new lioness in the den

10:41.208 --> 10:42.810
when Nala comes home?

10:42.843 --> 10:45.412
I knew this wasn't about lions.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.279
Forget it.
You just don't understand.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.514
I've been very clear

10:47.547 --> 10:50.317
that this is not an area I feel
comfortable chatting about.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.753
Fine.
I will find someone who is.

10:52.786 --> 10:55.422
(phone rings)

10:55.455 --> 10:56.423
Hey, Lemon.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.759
Who is the best campaign manager
in the world?

10:58.792 --> 10:59.760
James Carville.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.428
Did James Carville just
get a soft confirmation

11:01.461 --> 11:02.930
from Dash DeWitt?

11:02.963 --> 11:03.764
No way, for reals?

11:03.797 --> 11:05.032
The Owl endorsement
is in the bag.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.900
(laughing)

11:06.934 --> 11:08.301
Who-who!
(laughs)

11:08.335 --> 11:09.703
Stay tuned for more.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.207
(chants in celebration)

11:16.109 --> 11:17.210
Wade, more ginger ale.

11:17.244 --> 11:20.380
You, uh, feeling okay, Lemon?

11:20.413 --> 11:21.782
Just a little nauseous.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.316
What my daddy used
to call "circus tummy."

11:23.350 --> 11:27.487
Heard you signed on
as Lavon's campaign manager.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.356
Certain defeat
would make anyone queasy.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.958
The only thing I'm worried
about is how big

11:30.991 --> 11:33.026
the margin of Lavon's
victory will be.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.494
I'd like something
for the history books.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.230
Well, I heard about your
Meat & Greet tomorrow.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.366
Sounded like so much fun,
I decided to have one too.

11:42.502 --> 11:43.303
Well, you know what they say:

11:43.336 --> 11:44.938
if you don't have ideas
of your own,

11:44.972 --> 11:46.039
at least steal from the best.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.941
Actually, my event is going
to be a little different.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.376
See, I have Paula Deen

11:49.409 --> 11:51.478
doing the barbeque rub
for my ribs.

11:51.511 --> 11:52.980
She's a personal friend.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.916
Well, unless Paula's
planning on doing her rub

11:55.949 --> 11:58.085
on a genie bottle,
it's not gonna work.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.754
Because I just scored Lavon
the Owl endorsement.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.756
Oh.

12:02.790 --> 12:06.293
Here, looks like
you could use this.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.229
Thanks, Wade.

12:11.098 --> 12:15.102
I'm voting for Lavon.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.974
Hey.
Hey.

12:21.008 --> 12:21.975
What's for breakfast?

12:22.009 --> 12:22.976
Peanut butter and jelly.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.511
Well, come on.
It's good for you.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.113
It's, uh, protein...

12:26.146 --> 12:27.815
and, uh, jelly.

12:27.848 --> 12:28.681
What?

12:28.715 --> 12:31.118
I'm sorry, hon,
but we're out of eggs

12:31.151 --> 12:32.986
and cereal and yogurt

12:33.020 --> 12:36.389
and milk and juice
and clean dishes.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.424
Daddy?

12:37.457 --> 12:38.959
Are we gonna die?

12:38.992 --> 12:41.061
No, no.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.930
Here's an idea:

12:42.963 --> 12:44.064
we can make a list
and then, uh,

12:44.097 --> 12:47.034
maybe tonight, after school,
you could stop by the store

12:47.067 --> 12:49.937
and pick up some groceries,
and then, uh, maybe drop off

12:49.970 --> 12:51.238
some laundry too--
hey, that be fun, huh?

12:51.271 --> 12:52.239
Seriously?

12:52.272 --> 12:54.842
Do I need to call
Child Protective Services?

12:54.875 --> 12:57.410
I appreciate
I've let things slide.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.980
But Lemon has taken
brave steps

13:00.013 --> 13:02.049
towards being independent.

13:02.082 --> 13:05.853
And I think
we should learn from her.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.855
So, tonight, I will stop
by the store

13:07.888 --> 13:10.023
and I will make us a delicious,
well-balanced dinner,

13:10.057 --> 13:12.292
and you will pick up
the dry cleaning

13:12.325 --> 13:14.227
and then do the laundry. Deal?

13:14.261 --> 13:15.829
(laughs)

13:15.863 --> 13:19.066
I'm sorry. I meant deal
or no allowance this month.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.401
Independence blows.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.036
ZOE:
A sock on the door?

13:23.070 --> 13:24.872
It's primitive. He might as well
slap on a bumper sticker

13:24.905 --> 13:26.006
that says
"If this house is a-rockin'..."

13:26.039 --> 13:28.075
Maybe it was a mistake.
Why don't you just ask Wade

13:28.108 --> 13:29.009
who the blonde was?

13:29.042 --> 13:30.277
Yeah, right, and give him
the satisfaction

13:30.310 --> 13:31.344
of knowing that it got to me.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.246
(sighs)
No way.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.247
But do you know what?
It'll be fine.

13:34.281 --> 13:35.448
Because it just opens me up

13:35.482 --> 13:37.985
to meeting other,
less primitive guys.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.486
So...
Hmm?

13:39.519 --> 13:40.988
is your cousin Zach
still in town?

13:41.021 --> 13:42.956
(giggles)

13:42.990 --> 13:44.591
I'm-a text him right now,
tell him to take you

13:44.624 --> 13:45.926
to that new bistro
in Mobile tonight.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.460
Oh, right.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.229
Hey, he can read.
Things are already looking up.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.133
(sighs)

13:55.168 --> 13:56.369
Wow, Lavon got the Owls?

13:56.403 --> 13:58.939
Oh, sorry.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.373
That's all right. I know.

14:00.407 --> 14:01.608
Team Lavon.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.243
It's all good.
Good for him.

14:03.276 --> 14:04.344
Ruby, thank you.

14:04.377 --> 14:05.345
You're a good friend.

14:05.378 --> 14:06.613
Aw, have fun tonight.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.181
Thanks.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.954
(grunts)

14:13.987 --> 14:16.089
Hey, Wade, what's up?

14:16.123 --> 14:17.357
Hey, good news:
the, uh, tile came in.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.525
I'll get started
on your bathroom tomorrow.

14:18.558 --> 14:19.526
Oh.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.962
That is, unless the, uh,

14:21.995 --> 14:24.364
naughty doctor wants
to put me on bed rest.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.967
Oh, sorry,
no house calls tonight.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.401
I've got a date.

14:30.137 --> 14:31.104
You do?

14:31.138 --> 14:33.941
Yeah, with Ruby's cousin.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.977
He's taking me to the new
bistro in Mobile, whatever.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.511
Oh.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.080
Well, I hear the salmon's good.

14:40.113 --> 14:43.116
Oh. Great.
Well, you know,

14:43.150 --> 14:44.684
this might be kind of awkward,

14:44.717 --> 14:47.120
but if you have
to come here tomorrow,

14:47.154 --> 14:48.989
in the morning
to work on the bathroom,

14:49.022 --> 14:51.524
Yeah, you, uh, better
just, like, knock.

14:51.558 --> 14:56.096
'Cause I might have
a houseguest.

14:56.129 --> 14:56.964
Oh, good choice.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.131
It complements your eyes.

14:59.499 --> 15:00.533
Enjoy the date.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.303
(sighs)

15:10.543 --> 15:13.013
(clears throat)

15:13.046 --> 15:17.017
Hey, Zach, it's Zoe again,
Ruby's friend?

15:17.050 --> 15:18.118
Yeah, you know, I was thinking

15:18.151 --> 15:21.688
maybe we could do something
a little more casual?

15:21.721 --> 15:25.392
Do you know how to find
the Rammer Jammer?

15:25.425 --> 15:26.960
I'm glad to see
all Belles present today,

15:26.994 --> 15:28.395
as I have huge news.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.197
As you may be aware, I have

15:30.230 --> 15:32.565
humbly and graciously
accepted the job

15:32.599 --> 15:34.968
as Lavon Hayes'
campaign manager.

15:35.002 --> 15:37.004
I still don't understand that.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.972
Last year,
when he ran unopposed,

15:39.006 --> 15:41.041
we backed "None of the Above."

15:41.074 --> 15:42.242
What changed?

15:42.275 --> 15:44.077
It's very simple:
A) the mayor

15:44.111 --> 15:46.013
has a very
Belle-positive platform,

15:46.046 --> 15:48.515
and B) I want Ruby Jeffries
to know, once and for all,

15:48.548 --> 15:49.983
that she cannot beat
Lemon Breeland.

15:50.017 --> 15:51.051
Mostly B.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.221
(clears throat)

15:54.254 --> 15:56.389
Excuse me. Ooh.

15:57.424 --> 16:01.461
To that end, tomorrow
I will be hosting a barbeque

16:01.494 --> 16:03.530
to help secure the endorsement
of the Owl Club.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.298
I thank you all in advance

16:05.332 --> 16:08.101
for your unanimous support
and mandatory attendance.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.203
I now yield the floor
to AnnaBeth

16:10.237 --> 16:12.372
for other Belle business.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.409
Whew, what a relief.

16:16.443 --> 16:19.312
Given all that ginger ale
and how pasty you look,

16:19.346 --> 16:22.582
when you said you had huge news,
I thought you were pregnant.

16:22.615 --> 16:23.650
What a mess
that would be, huh?

16:40.467 --> 16:43.270
ZACH: Here you go.
ZOE: Thank you.

16:46.539 --> 16:49.109
So, what's good?

16:49.142 --> 16:52.245
Good might be aiming too high.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.114
Uh, there's a burger that
probably won't cause you
physical harm.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.648
WADE:
Well, hello there, Doc.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.251
I thought you were
going to be in Mobile.

16:58.285 --> 17:00.120
Oh, change of plans.

17:00.153 --> 17:00.820
Right.

17:00.853 --> 17:01.821
Hey, I'm Wade.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.656
Zach.
Good to meet you.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.292
You, uh, need a drink, anything
at all, you just holler.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.494
Actually, uh,
first round's on me.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.329
Aw, thanks.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.663
Hey, what's the catch
of the day?

17:10.696 --> 17:12.432
You are.

17:14.567 --> 17:15.602
Uh...

17:16.469 --> 17:19.806
I'll get your server.

17:19.839 --> 17:23.143
Nice guy.
Buddy of yours?

17:23.175 --> 17:25.112
Neighbor, casual neighbor.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.546
But, Zach,

17:26.579 --> 17:28.147
tell me about you.
What do you do?

17:28.181 --> 17:30.183
Because tonight is about you.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.291
So, you ready
for this?
No.

17:38.325 --> 17:41.828
Oh.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.163
Oh, for the Meat & Greet? Yes.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.531
Of course, don't be silly.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.234
So, let's go over
tomorrow's order of events.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.034
Do you have the list?

17:48.067 --> 17:50.503
The list you just
had me print?

17:50.537 --> 17:52.839
Let's do a run-through.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.307
So, we start serving
at noon, and then?

17:54.341 --> 17:55.842
Then I-I give my
welcome speech at 12:30,

17:55.875 --> 17:59.546
followed by Dash
and the Owl endorsement.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.415
Lemon, you okay?

18:03.750 --> 18:05.718
Oh.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.255
Sorry.
It's just my mind's racing.

18:08.288 --> 18:11.858
You know, with an event like
this, anything can happen.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.126
And just when you think
you've finally got your bearings

18:13.160 --> 18:16.629
and planned your next move, then
that bomb comes out of the blue.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.565
Whoa, whoa, what's going on?
A-A-Are you crying?

18:21.734 --> 18:23.770
We need to get started
on our shopping. That's what.

18:25.338 --> 18:29.209
Those ribs aren't
going to cook themselves.

18:36.416 --> 18:37.384
Shelby.

18:37.417 --> 18:38.418
Surprise.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.819
I'm so surprised.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.454
I got your message
about meeting for coffee

18:41.488 --> 18:42.322
and I was already in town

18:42.355 --> 18:45.558
and, oh, my God,
I love these pillows!

18:45.592 --> 18:47.527
Yeah, uh,

18:47.560 --> 18:49.162
my ex-fiancée
seemed to think

18:49.196 --> 18:51.731
that green would make me
feel powerful.

18:51.764 --> 18:52.899
Oh, yes. Green does that.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.767
Yeah, not really
my style though,

18:54.801 --> 18:57.204
um, but, since
you're here...
You know what?

18:57.237 --> 18:59.939
If you don't like green, I
should send you this great link

18:59.972 --> 19:01.808
for 50% off decorative shams.

19:01.841 --> 19:02.809
No, that's all right...
No, it's perfect for you.

19:02.842 --> 19:03.643
I mean, they're doing
a two-for-one right now

19:03.676 --> 19:04.644
and you can replace
all the pillows.

19:04.677 --> 19:07.814
Shelby, really, I'm fine.
I am all shammed up.

19:07.847 --> 19:08.615
But I wanted to talk.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.651
Oh, yay,
I love to talk.
I know.

19:11.684 --> 19:12.785
I mean, I could just talk and
talk and talk and talk and...

19:12.819 --> 19:14.487
Yeah, yeah, me first.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.356
So, um...

19:18.325 --> 19:19.292
Shelby?
Mm-hmm?

19:19.326 --> 19:20.827
I just wanted
to tell you that

19:20.860 --> 19:24.697
well, your beauty humbles
a simple man like me...

19:24.731 --> 19:25.698
What's that supposed to mean?

19:25.732 --> 19:26.799
What?

19:26.833 --> 19:28.801
It's a compliment.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.404
Oh, sorry, I wasn't sure.

19:31.438 --> 19:32.672
My last boyfriend
was bit of a jerk,

19:32.705 --> 19:34.307
so, I guess
I'm compliment-starved.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.675
That is so nice.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.545
Anyway...
What do you mean
by "beauty" specifically?

19:38.578 --> 19:40.847
I mean, I know we all have
these parts about ourselves

19:40.880 --> 19:42.949
that we like and we don't
like, and it might be fun

19:42.982 --> 19:45.552
to see if we agree on all mine.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.687
Well, um...

19:47.720 --> 19:50.990
You have skin.
You have great skin.

19:51.023 --> 19:55.328
Mm-hmm, and what else?

19:58.565 --> 20:00.833
So, basically I design low-cost,
affordable green housing.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.470
Wow, that is amazing work.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.671
It's pretty rewarding.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.573
But what about you,
big city surgeon

20:06.606 --> 20:09.442
turned small-town doctor,
what's that story?

20:09.476 --> 20:10.477
Oh, come on!

20:11.644 --> 20:12.545
Something wrong?

20:12.579 --> 20:13.846
What? No.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.315
But don't you hate this?

20:15.348 --> 20:17.717
We have not been offered
refills on our drinks.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.986
Well, you still have a lot.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.854
Mm-mm.

20:21.888 --> 20:22.989
Barkeep.

20:23.022 --> 20:27.093
You got customers
over here, too.

20:30.963 --> 20:33.700
Just one moment, I need
one tiny little thing.

20:33.733 --> 20:34.734
Okay.

20:44.511 --> 20:45.478
WANDA:
Lemon.

20:45.512 --> 20:46.813
No way.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.981
No way, you got Lavon
the Owl Club endorsement?

20:49.015 --> 20:52.519
Whoa, you go, girl.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.626
I know exactly
what you're getting.

20:59.659 --> 21:00.893
It's that new green
tea foot lotion.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.562
(nervous laugh)

21:02.595 --> 21:05.598
I keep strict tabs
on what my customers buy,

21:05.632 --> 21:08.301
and those are selling
like hotcakes.

21:08.335 --> 21:09.569
Can't sneak anything
past you, Frank.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.570
LAVON:
Frank?

21:10.603 --> 21:12.639
What is this?

21:12.672 --> 21:14.073
You plan on putting
this in the window?

21:14.106 --> 21:16.543
The window I authorized
town funds to repair

21:16.576 --> 21:18.478
after the storm blew it out?

21:18.511 --> 21:19.979
Ruby's tough on crime.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.013
What crime?

21:21.047 --> 21:22.949
When Bud Meeks stole
those Twinkies last month,

21:22.982 --> 21:23.783
what you do?

21:23.816 --> 21:26.085
Wait, I know the answer.
Call on me.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.887
Nothing.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.922
Bud Meeks is six years old.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.758
That's where it starts.

21:35.595 --> 21:38.631
You get what
you need?
Oh, changed my mind.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.967
Anyhoo, ooh, ooh, ooh.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.602
Mayor shouldn't carry
his own bags.

21:42.635 --> 21:45.104
That is a job
for your campaign manager.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.006
FRANK:
That'll be $18.94.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.743
So, no foot cream?
Nope.

21:50.777 --> 21:52.912
Not today, Frank.
My feet are very soft today.

21:52.945 --> 21:53.913
(chuckles)

21:53.946 --> 21:55.882
Think about the posters, Frank.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.388
Give my love to Melinda!

22:01.421 --> 22:03.690
(alarm blares)

22:03.723 --> 22:05.124
What is that?!

22:05.157 --> 22:08.995
It's the security system
I installed post-Meeks.

22:09.028 --> 22:10.463
Don't anybody move!

22:20.407 --> 22:22.609
Lemon Breeland!
I caught you in the act.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.043
What?!
That is not mine!

22:24.076 --> 22:25.912
I don't know how
that got in there.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.480
Tell that to the sheriff.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.983
Uh, it's mine.
What?

22:31.017 --> 22:33.986
I put it in the bag,
thought you rung it up already.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.889
What do you need
a pregnancy test for?

22:41.193 --> 22:42.462
For my gator--

22:42.495 --> 22:43.863
Burt Reynolds.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.898
I-I think she may be in heat.

22:47.534 --> 22:48.735
And a girl.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.571
Gators have
internal sex organs.

22:51.604 --> 22:54.040
It's, uh...
it's difficult to tell.

22:57.544 --> 23:00.847
ZACH:
So then the governor wrote me
a personal letter of thanks.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.982
What do you think about lions?

23:03.015 --> 23:06.118
I mean, they are stupid cats,
don't you think?

23:06.152 --> 23:07.386
You know what?

23:07.420 --> 23:12.759
If you switched the letters in
"lion," it would spell "loin."

23:12.792 --> 23:13.760
(laughs)

23:13.793 --> 23:14.761
That says something.

23:14.794 --> 23:17.029
You know what?
Why don't I just walk you home?

23:17.063 --> 23:20.032
(laughs)

23:20.066 --> 23:22.134
I thought you two were
going into Mobile.

23:22.168 --> 23:23.169
Hey, Ruby!

23:23.202 --> 23:24.604
Hey!

23:24.637 --> 23:26.573
No. We changed the minds of us

23:26.606 --> 23:29.909
and we came here
and had some drinks.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.978
Plural. Big ones.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.012
Uh-huh.
(laughs)

23:34.013 --> 23:35.915
Oh, no.
Hmm?

23:35.948 --> 23:39.018
No, no, this is
not about the lion!

23:39.051 --> 23:40.987
Zach and I--
we are having

23:41.020 --> 23:42.455
an awesome time.
Zach!

23:42.489 --> 23:46.859
'Cause I'm a casual,
carefree, casual girl.

23:46.893 --> 23:51.864
And I am totally rockin'
the cas... bah.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.566
And Zach was just
taking me home.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.736
And we all know
what that means. Mm-hmm.

23:56.769 --> 23:57.837
ZACH:
Yeah.
Whoo!

23:57.870 --> 23:59.105
He's gonna have
to take a rain check.

23:59.138 --> 24:00.940
Oh, why,
because you're jealous?

24:00.973 --> 24:03.175
No, I'm not jealous.
I just got a call from Lavon.

24:03.209 --> 24:05.177
He have to meet him
at the Dixie Stop.

24:05.211 --> 24:06.979
Yeah, right. What for?

24:10.817 --> 24:13.920
Lavon got arrested
for shoplifting?!

24:15.955 --> 24:17.857
Um, you know what?

24:17.890 --> 24:21.127
I suddenly don't feel like
I need that drink after all.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.899
Do you think that she heard me?

24:26.933 --> 24:29.769
Oh, I think there's a very good
possibility of that, yes.

24:33.239 --> 24:34.641
Okay, don't freak out.

24:34.674 --> 24:37.243
Oh, I love it
when you start that way.

24:37.276 --> 24:38.110
You know how you're supposed

24:38.144 --> 24:39.612
to separate the whites
and the colors?

24:39.646 --> 24:40.246
Well, I do.

24:40.279 --> 24:42.148
These are the whites!

24:42.181 --> 24:43.149
Oh...

24:43.182 --> 24:44.917
Daddy, it's such a mistake!

24:44.951 --> 24:46.252
I know,
but don't beat yourself up.

24:46.285 --> 24:48.855
I meant making me do anything!

24:48.888 --> 24:50.923
You are old enough
to know better.

24:50.957 --> 24:52.925
Look, we'll figure it out.

24:52.959 --> 24:55.862
Just sit down here
before your dinner gets cold.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.797
I used your grandmother's
old recipe book.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.498
I made étouffée.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.738
Is étouffée French
for a "cat's butt"?

25:05.772 --> 25:07.707
Don't be rude.

25:08.975 --> 25:10.777
Oh! (coughs) Lordy!

25:10.810 --> 25:14.013
Daddy, we have no clothes.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.214
We cannot feed ourselves.

25:15.247 --> 25:16.883
We have to make Lemon come home.

25:16.916 --> 25:19.051
Grandma always made it
seem so easy.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.258
Where's Lavon?

25:26.292 --> 25:28.795
Look, I can testify
to his moral character.

25:28.828 --> 25:30.897
And if that doesn't work,
I got bail money.

25:30.930 --> 25:32.765
You won't be needing it.

25:32.799 --> 25:35.735
Sheriff Bill fined him $42
and let him go.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.637
He's in the
mayor's pocket.

25:37.670 --> 25:40.006
Or the mayor's in his.
I never could get that...

25:40.039 --> 25:42.174
This whole town is
a den of thieves,

25:42.208 --> 25:45.044
from the mayor on down
to that Lemon Breeland,

25:45.077 --> 25:47.346
who was probably
his decoy.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.081
And you know
what takes the cake?

25:49.115 --> 25:51.918
The mayor never did pay for his
alligator's pregnancy test!

25:51.951 --> 25:54.553
Burt Reynolds is a girl?

25:55.888 --> 25:59.792
Well, alligators do have
internal sex organs.

26:03.329 --> 26:05.331
And what do you think
about my hands?

26:05.364 --> 26:08.000
I'm always worried that my left
hand is bigger than my right.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.736
Or is it my right bigger
than my left?

26:09.769 --> 26:10.670
(phone rings)

26:10.703 --> 26:12.571
Both of them are fine.
I gotta take this.

26:14.373 --> 26:16.042
Hey, Wade,
perfect timing.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.878
Uh, you know that "sandwich"
that we were talking about?

26:18.911 --> 26:21.681
Yeah, I'm gonna need some help
with that recipe.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.349
Trust me, man.
You got bigger problems.

26:23.382 --> 26:26.919
You sitting?
Maybe you should sit.

26:33.025 --> 26:35.261
Ruby! Ruby, stop!

26:37.263 --> 26:38.898
You know Lavon.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.833
He is honest
and honorable

26:40.867 --> 26:42.869
and so not a shoplifter.

26:42.902 --> 26:44.837
You can't use this
against him.

26:44.871 --> 26:47.874
Zoe, I already leaked it
to the BlueBell Gazette.

26:47.907 --> 26:49.041
I had to.

26:49.075 --> 26:50.276
Are you kidding?

26:50.309 --> 26:53.279
Lavon was going to crush me
with that Owl Club endorsement.

26:53.312 --> 26:54.714
I trusted you!

26:54.747 --> 26:56.949
I know, but this
is a campaign.

26:56.983 --> 26:59.819
And if I win,
I'd be a great mayor.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.890
You'd get how I feel if you
understood how much I want this.

27:03.923 --> 27:05.958
All I understand is

27:05.992 --> 27:08.127
that you're purposely hurting
someone that I care about.

27:08.160 --> 27:11.030
No real friend of mine
would do ever do that.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.036
Lavon, I cannot thank you enough
for saying that test was yours.

27:17.069 --> 27:20.072
The campaign...

27:20.106 --> 27:21.407
The sheriff and I handled it.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.743
It's you we should be
thinking about right now.

27:23.776 --> 27:24.677
I was just starting to think

27:24.711 --> 27:28.047
that I could be independent,
but... a baby?

27:28.080 --> 27:30.216
I mean, I wanted one
my whole life,

27:30.249 --> 27:31.918
and I could never...

27:31.951 --> 27:35.187
I just never imagined
having one without George.

27:35.221 --> 27:38.190
And I think about all the crying
and spitting up and...

27:38.224 --> 27:40.226
How am I gonna do it?

27:40.259 --> 27:41.928
Are you kidding me?

27:43.462 --> 27:45.898
Lemon, you raised your sister
practically on your own

27:45.932 --> 27:49.201
while graduating high school
and college

27:49.235 --> 27:50.937
and leading the Belles,

27:50.970 --> 27:52.972
and God knows
what else.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.240
I was just thinking

27:54.273 --> 27:56.075
that I really want
to have a career and...

27:56.108 --> 27:58.911
Okay, now, I know
some people say

27:58.945 --> 28:00.980
that women can't have it all.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.949
Well, those people have
never met Lemon Breeland.

28:04.984 --> 28:06.953
Now I have no doubt that you
will be a magnificent mother.

28:10.222 --> 28:14.326
The only question is...

28:14.360 --> 28:16.128
are you gonna be one now?

28:19.966 --> 28:21.734
(sighs)

28:34.246 --> 28:36.348
George?

28:36.382 --> 28:37.950
What are you doing here?

28:37.984 --> 28:40.186
Lemon, I know that things have
been strained between us,

28:40.219 --> 28:41.253
but if you're pregnant,

28:41.287 --> 28:43.055
you will not have
to do this alone.

28:43.089 --> 28:44.290
Oh, my God.

28:44.323 --> 28:46.058
Am I the only person
in this town

28:46.092 --> 28:47.259
that can keep a secret?

28:51.097 --> 28:52.031
Thank you, George,

28:52.064 --> 28:54.366
but I took the test,
and I'm not pregnant.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.135
You're not?

28:57.269 --> 28:59.505
I'm sorry.
Did that come out too happy?

28:59.538 --> 29:02.975
Happy is fine.
Believe me...

29:03.009 --> 29:04.911
I am.

29:04.944 --> 29:07.847
Right.

29:07.880 --> 29:11.350
Well... now that
I can drink...

29:12.384 --> 29:14.253
I don't know
why we shouldn't.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.891
We can't just ask Lemon
to come back.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.459
No, we have to beg.

29:20.492 --> 29:23.329
No, no, she has to think
it is her idea.

29:23.362 --> 29:24.897
We just got
to get her over here.

29:24.931 --> 29:27.166
You know Lemon: Once she sees
the mess we're in,

29:27.199 --> 29:30.002
she won't be able to stop
herself from fixing our lives.

29:30.036 --> 29:32.238
You need tutoring...
in chemistry.

29:32.271 --> 29:34.340
But I can't help you
'cause I gotta...

29:34.373 --> 29:36.508
Who told you?
It was just one test.

29:36.542 --> 29:37.143
Are you failing chemistry?

29:37.176 --> 29:38.878
Maybe I'd be doing better

29:38.911 --> 29:39.812
if I wasn't starving.

29:39.846 --> 29:43.983
Okay. So, she comes over,
she tutors you.

29:44.016 --> 29:45.885
Once she's here,
she won't be able to leave

29:45.918 --> 29:49.822
without doing the laundry and
making some macaroni and cheese.

29:49.856 --> 29:52.191
Yeah, well, that is
a little deceptive.

29:52.224 --> 29:54.526
Daddy, this is the right thing.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.829
'Cause once we run out
of peanut butter,

29:56.863 --> 29:58.030
I'm gonna have to eat you.

29:59.098 --> 30:01.901
Guess all the nausea was
just a virus or something.

30:01.934 --> 30:05.137
Actually, I don't think it was.

30:05.171 --> 30:07.339
Okay, so now you're a doctor?

30:07.373 --> 30:10.476
No, but you remember
when we went up to Martin Lake

30:10.509 --> 30:12.578
and I rented that canoe,
and we didn't get...

30:12.611 --> 30:14.881
...Even 50 feet from the dock

30:14.914 --> 30:17.583
before I made you turn that
thing around. I was so...

30:18.985 --> 30:20.953
seasick.

30:20.987 --> 30:22.254
Mm-hmm.

30:22.288 --> 30:25.257
George, no,
I-I can't be seasick.

30:25.291 --> 30:26.525
I live on a boat.

30:26.558 --> 30:29.862
And I have to live here because
I can't afford my own apartment

30:29.896 --> 30:30.930
and I'm not moving
back home.

30:30.963 --> 30:31.864
I'm gonna have to take

30:31.898 --> 30:34.066
to sleeping in the gazebo
with Crazy Earl.

30:34.100 --> 30:37.970
Or...

30:38.004 --> 30:39.405
I could live here.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.240
What?

30:41.273 --> 30:43.075
Lemon, I am so sick
of my apartment.

30:43.109 --> 30:46.078
I'm drowning in pillow shams.
I'm serious.

30:46.112 --> 30:48.214
We could both use a fresh start.
Let's switch.

30:48.247 --> 30:50.950
George, this boat is a dump.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.018
Yeah, but, I mean,

30:52.051 --> 30:53.485
the kitchen and the living room
are the same room.

30:53.519 --> 30:54.553
That's really neat.

30:54.586 --> 30:55.955
Come on. Please?

30:55.988 --> 30:57.957
Oh, my goodness.
You know, sometimes I think

30:57.990 --> 30:59.959
that God gave you
such a big heart

30:59.992 --> 31:03.595
that he just left no room
for plain sense.

31:03.629 --> 31:06.532
You know, what if you came here
tonight and I was pregnant?

31:09.168 --> 31:10.970
Then we would've raised
the baby together.

31:11.003 --> 31:14.106
Really?

31:14.140 --> 31:16.943
After everything?

31:16.976 --> 31:17.977
Absolutely.

31:18.010 --> 31:21.080
George...

31:21.113 --> 31:26.552
that is very kind
of you, but...

31:26.585 --> 31:28.554
It's so, so misguided.

31:28.587 --> 31:31.257
Because it wasn't
what you wanted.

31:31.290 --> 31:34.393
Again.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.662
And I think if you
had spent five minutes

31:36.695 --> 31:38.664
anytime in the last year
thinking about that,

31:38.697 --> 31:43.135
we wouldn't be
in this... debacle.

31:44.370 --> 31:47.406
That's probably true.

31:50.042 --> 31:51.643
Lemon, I know what I want.

31:53.179 --> 31:55.147
I want this boat.

31:57.183 --> 31:59.151
(chuckles)

32:04.190 --> 32:07.960
Hey, Lavon.

32:07.994 --> 32:10.096
Old pal!

32:10.129 --> 32:10.997
You okay?

32:11.030 --> 32:14.033
That was the newspaper...

32:14.066 --> 32:18.404
wanting a quote about my getting
busted for shoplifting.

32:18.437 --> 32:21.040
Oh, when this hits
the stands tomorrow,

32:21.073 --> 32:24.110
I can, I can forget about
the Owl Club endorsement.

32:24.143 --> 32:27.079
In fact, I can forget
about the election.

32:29.681 --> 32:33.986
Okay, okay, first,
there's only one newsstand.

32:34.020 --> 32:36.755
It would be very easy for
an "accident" to take it out.

32:36.788 --> 32:40.126
Zoe, the story's
already out there!

32:40.159 --> 32:42.161
I can't believe
Frank would leak this.

32:43.662 --> 32:47.033
Frank didn't. Ruby did.

32:47.066 --> 32:48.467
Ruby? No, no.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.202
How would she
even find out?

32:54.806 --> 32:56.075
Zoe?

32:58.044 --> 33:00.046
Okay, but remember
how you didn't want

33:00.079 --> 33:01.380
to hear about my sex life?

33:01.413 --> 33:02.748
Well, Ruby did want
to hear about it.

33:02.781 --> 33:04.416
And she wanted to set me up
with her cousin.

33:04.450 --> 33:06.018
At first I was like, no way,

33:06.052 --> 33:07.453
but then Wade put a sock
on his door,

33:07.486 --> 33:09.688
so I went on the date
because I can be casual, too.

33:09.721 --> 33:11.390
But I can also be drunk,
which I was,

33:11.423 --> 33:12.791
which I still might be,
but then Wade

33:12.824 --> 33:14.293
told me about the shoplifting,

33:14.326 --> 33:16.395
and I blurted it out,
and Ruby heard.

33:16.428 --> 33:20.799
So... in trying to prove to Wade

33:20.832 --> 33:22.634
that you could be casual,

33:22.668 --> 33:24.770
you casually destroyed
my campaign?

33:24.803 --> 33:26.772
See?

33:26.805 --> 33:28.774
The way you get
to the heart of things,

33:28.807 --> 33:32.144
that's why
you are a great friend.

33:39.818 --> 33:42.020
(sighs)

33:59.571 --> 34:00.806
Why did you not call me

34:00.839 --> 34:02.841
the second you found out
about this?

34:02.874 --> 34:05.844
Well, I figured you had
enough on your plate.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.779
Oh, I see.

34:07.813 --> 34:10.581
Well, it turns out my plate

34:10.616 --> 34:12.217
wasn't quite as full
as I thought.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.688
Wow, that's good news.

34:16.722 --> 34:18.123
No kidding.

34:18.157 --> 34:20.792
Well, at least
the picture's good.

34:20.826 --> 34:22.494
They can't take that away.

34:22.527 --> 34:23.795
Thank you, Tom.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.431
That means a lot.

34:25.464 --> 34:27.699
RUBY:
Come taste of Paula Deen's

34:27.733 --> 34:29.135
winning barbeque rub,

34:29.168 --> 34:31.170
compliments
of Ruby Jeffries for Mayor.

34:31.203 --> 34:32.571
Comes with a side of beans

34:32.603 --> 34:33.839
and a copy
of this morning's Gazette.

34:33.871 --> 34:35.241
LEMON:
You know what?

34:35.274 --> 34:37.176
This is complete
bull hockey.

34:37.208 --> 34:39.777
I'm your campaign manager.

34:39.811 --> 34:41.780
I'm gonna do something
about this.

34:41.813 --> 34:43.449
How?

34:43.482 --> 34:45.484
I'm gonna figure it out.
That's how.

35:07.806 --> 35:09.775
I am sorry
about all this.

35:09.808 --> 35:12.278
Thank you for coming.
Get you some barbeque.

35:12.311 --> 35:13.712
If you want,

35:13.745 --> 35:17.249
I can find another best friend
whose life I can ruin.

35:17.283 --> 35:19.318
(chuckles)

35:19.351 --> 35:21.287
No.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.922
Truth is, none of this
would have happened

35:23.955 --> 35:26.525
if I'd been a better friend

35:26.558 --> 35:28.627
and let you talk about Wade
in the first place.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.197
So, go ahead.

35:31.230 --> 35:34.433
(clears throat)
Talk about Wade.

35:34.466 --> 35:35.901
Wade?

35:35.934 --> 35:38.637
Why the hell would
I want to talk about Wade?

35:41.740 --> 35:44.376
Okay, maybe just one thing.

35:46.312 --> 35:48.747
Frank, I need
to talk to you.

35:48.780 --> 35:49.648
What? You want to distract me?

35:49.681 --> 35:52.284
Be an accessory
to another crime?
Frank,

35:52.318 --> 35:55.854
I wasn't the accessory.

35:56.888 --> 35:58.557
I was the thief.

36:00.459 --> 36:01.827
(laughs)

36:01.860 --> 36:03.429
You know how it is.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.198
Hey.

36:06.232 --> 36:07.966
Uh, Shelby?

36:07.999 --> 36:09.935
I did not know
you were coming to this thing.

36:09.968 --> 36:11.870
I missed you.

36:11.903 --> 36:13.672
Last night ended
so abruptly.

36:13.705 --> 36:14.840
You owe me half a date,
mister.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.708
Yeah, yeah.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.812
Shelby, look.

36:20.846 --> 36:21.880
Mm-hmm?

36:21.913 --> 36:23.815
I don't want
to go out with you.

36:23.849 --> 36:27.819
I mean, you are... you
are totally awesome.

36:27.853 --> 36:30.822
(chuckles)
But I don't want
to see you again.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.858
I got the sandwich backwards.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.927
You don't want
to see me again?

36:35.961 --> 36:37.829
What?

36:37.863 --> 36:39.831
Look, it's just that I
don't really like talking

36:39.865 --> 36:40.999
about discount shopping

36:41.032 --> 36:43.835
or pillow shams or all
the eating disorders

36:43.869 --> 36:45.404
that your friends have
or, well,

36:45.437 --> 36:47.973
pretty much anything

36:48.006 --> 36:49.841
that you like
to talk about so much.

36:56.348 --> 36:58.684
Uh, forgot to tell you
about the slapping part.

36:58.717 --> 36:59.818
It's kind of

36:59.851 --> 37:01.620
the toothpick in the sandwich.

37:02.654 --> 37:04.290
I think that went well.

37:04.323 --> 37:07.259
Okay, one last thing about
Wade, and then that's it.

37:07.293 --> 37:08.827
Okay.
I hate his house.

37:08.860 --> 37:09.995
It is so gross.

37:10.028 --> 37:11.830
Don't even get me started
on the bathroom.

37:11.863 --> 37:13.699
Big Z, come on.

37:13.732 --> 37:14.833
Fine.

37:14.866 --> 37:17.002
I just I thought
that being with me

37:17.035 --> 37:19.338
would mean Wade wouldn't
want to be with anyone else.

37:19.371 --> 37:20.739
Turns out that

37:20.772 --> 37:21.873
I'm just one of many.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.476
Kind of hurts my pride,
you know?

37:24.510 --> 37:26.412
But Zoe,

37:26.445 --> 37:29.581
I never figured you
for a casual type girl anyway.

37:29.615 --> 37:30.949
I know,

37:30.982 --> 37:33.752
but I really wanted to be.

37:33.785 --> 37:34.753
Thank you.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.855
Yeah.

37:36.888 --> 37:38.056
BRICK:
You remember the plan?

37:38.089 --> 37:40.426
Operation Get Lemon Back
is underway.

37:40.459 --> 37:41.760
That's not a very good name.

37:41.793 --> 37:43.429
Well, I'm faint from hunger.
It's all I've got.

37:43.462 --> 37:44.963
So have you heard,
Dr. Breeland?

37:44.996 --> 37:47.599
Your daughter stole a pregnancy
test from my store yesterday.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.303
Not me.

37:51.337 --> 37:52.738
No, the other one.

37:52.771 --> 37:53.939
I told the sheriff,

37:53.972 --> 37:56.475
but God forbid
she does any time.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.944
It's why the world
is in the state it's in.

37:58.977 --> 38:00.346
I, for one,

38:00.379 --> 38:01.947
will welcome the zombies.

38:05.984 --> 38:07.986
Hmm.

38:08.019 --> 38:10.356
Lavon Hayes
does photograph well.

38:10.389 --> 38:11.657
Hey.

38:11.690 --> 38:12.858
Hey.

38:12.891 --> 38:14.025
So, I confessed my crime.

38:14.059 --> 38:15.861
Wait.

38:15.894 --> 38:17.829
Lemon, you didn't have
to do that.

38:17.863 --> 38:19.665
Last night, you put
my needs before yours.

38:19.698 --> 38:22.000
Now it's my turn
to do the same.

38:22.033 --> 38:24.436
So Sheriff Bill promised

38:24.470 --> 38:26.372
to drop the charges
as long as I bake him a pie,

38:26.405 --> 38:29.408
and Frank went to tell Dash
and the Owls the truth.

38:29.441 --> 38:31.109
So they're not giving us
their endorsement just yet,

38:31.142 --> 38:33.979
but they're not giving
Ruby her endorsement.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.814
So, there's hope,

38:35.847 --> 38:37.883
especially if you fire me.

38:37.916 --> 38:39.751
Fire you?

38:40.719 --> 38:41.953
Lavon Hayes

38:41.987 --> 38:43.389
does not fire his friends.

38:44.590 --> 38:46.024
And, Lemon,
it turns out that we are.

38:48.594 --> 38:50.762
Oh,

38:50.796 --> 38:52.564
I see we have some customers.

38:52.598 --> 38:54.566
I mean, uh,

38:54.600 --> 38:56.602
voters.

38:59.738 --> 39:02.708
Is there something
you wanted to tell us?

39:02.741 --> 39:04.843
Yes, I stole it, okay?

39:04.876 --> 39:06.712
I know that's not
how you raised me.

39:06.745 --> 39:07.779
I'm sorry,

39:07.813 --> 39:08.914
but there it is.

39:08.947 --> 39:10.882
About... being pregnant?

39:10.916 --> 39:12.083
Oh! Oh, no,
no, no, I'm not.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.986
I'm sorry, I didn't know how far
along in the story you were.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.021
No, I was just seasick.
Oh!

39:16.054 --> 39:19.625
Oh, thank God.

39:19.658 --> 39:21.860
Can I have the boat?

39:21.893 --> 39:23.094
No.

39:23.128 --> 39:24.863
George and I traded places.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.732
I've always loved
his apartment,

39:26.765 --> 39:27.833
and I was gonna
live there anyway.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.468
Just now I'll do it
without George.

39:29.501 --> 39:30.602
It's all gonna work out.

39:30.636 --> 39:31.737
Great. Good for you.

39:31.770 --> 39:32.871
Crap.

39:32.904 --> 39:34.606
Y'all okay?
You look a little pale.

39:34.640 --> 39:35.974
Oh, no, we're fine.

39:36.007 --> 39:36.875
We're fine, we're...
Mm-hmm.

39:36.908 --> 39:38.844
We're gonna figure it out.

39:38.877 --> 39:41.046
You just... you go on
and help your candidate.

39:43.649 --> 39:45.617
What about the laundry?

39:46.952 --> 39:48.487
First thing tomorrow,

39:48.520 --> 39:51.423
you go buy us new clothes.

39:51.457 --> 39:52.691
Awesome.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.092
And the food?

39:54.125 --> 39:55.861
We are gonna take as much
of this barbeque

39:55.894 --> 39:58.730
as we can carry, enough to last
us for at least a week.

39:58.764 --> 40:00.799
See? We are so independent.

40:22.921 --> 40:24.923
(sighs)

40:29.695 --> 40:31.229
Look, I'm sorry

40:31.262 --> 40:34.065
that I acted like such
a wackadoo last night.

40:34.099 --> 40:37.969
I just don't think
this casual sex thing is for me.

40:38.003 --> 40:39.738
That's too bad.

40:39.771 --> 40:40.906
I was kind of liking it.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.508
Me, too.

40:42.541 --> 40:45.944
Which is why

40:45.977 --> 40:49.247
I'm not asking you
to be my boyfriend or anything,

40:49.280 --> 40:52.684
but I was just wondering

40:52.718 --> 40:54.886
if you could do casual my way,

40:54.920 --> 40:57.756
which means being monogamous?

40:57.789 --> 40:59.090
Casually.

40:59.124 --> 41:01.827
Yeah.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.662
Yeah, I think I can do that.

41:05.697 --> 41:06.998
You know
what "monogamous" means, right?

41:07.032 --> 41:07.833
(chuckles)

41:07.866 --> 41:08.900
No hot blondes,

41:08.934 --> 41:09.901
no socks on the door.

41:11.603 --> 41:13.038
Just to be clear,

41:13.071 --> 41:15.907
the blonde who was here
yesterday, that was Missy

41:15.941 --> 41:18.610
from Ace Building Supply.

41:18.644 --> 41:20.879
She was dropping off the
tile for your bathroom.

41:20.912 --> 41:22.781
And as for the sock,

41:22.814 --> 41:25.551
well, I hung it up after
I stepped in raccoon crap.

41:25.584 --> 41:28.219
Oh.

41:28.253 --> 41:30.789
Oh. Seems to me that,

41:30.822 --> 41:32.290
uh, you probably need

41:32.323 --> 41:34.860
to be sent to the principal's
office for punishment.

41:34.893 --> 41:35.861
What?

41:35.894 --> 41:37.863
Oh. Right.

41:37.896 --> 41:40.298
I've been bad.

41:40.331 --> 41:43.301
Bad.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.737
But no spanking. Seriously,
I don't believe in it.

41:45.771 --> 41:47.038
(smacks)
 Hey, I mean it!
