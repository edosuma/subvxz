<i>I've made some
bad decisions in my life.</i>

00:41.644 --> 00:45.881
<i>My name is Demetrius,
but my friends call me Diggy.</i>

00:48.150 --> 00:50.416
<i>If you would have asked
me yesterday, when will I die?</i>

00:50.418 --> 00:51.821
<i>This is for my niece.</i>

00:54.489 --> 00:55.390
No!

00:56.959 --> 00:59.828
<i>I would have said I'm
going to live forever, and a day.</i>

01:00.762 --> 01:05.600
<i>So much to do,
so many places to see.</i>

01:07.001 --> 01:08.000
Go!

01:18.112 --> 01:20.780
Diggy! Come on, man.

01:20.782 --> 01:23.449
<i>I never got to
tell my brother,</i>

01:23.451 --> 01:24.786
<i>"Don't follow in my footsteps."</i>

01:29.958 --> 01:31.292
<i>Sorry,
I couldn't save you, Momma.</i>

01:35.163 --> 01:37.031
<i>I never even
made love before, man.</i>

01:42.837 --> 01:45.106
<i>Out of everything
I wanted to do in my life,</i>

01:46.874 --> 01:48.542
<i>I never heard my father speak.</i>

02:09.128 --> 02:10.130
- How y'all?
- Chilling.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.735
- All right, y'all.
- Be good.

02:18.238 --> 02:19.640
- Good?
- Yeah, man.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.744
- She dropped it off last night.
- That's crazy.

02:25.746 --> 02:28.712
- Are you allergic to bees, man?
- Yeah, man you know that.

02:28.714 --> 02:31.216
Nine o'clock bees,
Nine o'clock bees, dude.

02:31.218 --> 02:33.153
They are right there
on you, dude, watch out!

02:34.121 --> 02:35.586
Dude, watch...

02:35.588 --> 02:37.688
You stupid man. Y'all!

02:37.690 --> 02:39.556
Everything we deal with
on the street,

02:39.558 --> 02:40.791
you still afraid of bees, man?

02:40.793 --> 02:41.761
Bees can kill you, man.

02:43.763 --> 02:46.164
My face swelled up.
Why are you laughing, man?

02:46.166 --> 02:48.434
Since seven
years old, never fail.

02:49.568 --> 02:51.101
- Calvin is home, man. I'm leaving.
- Good.

02:51.103 --> 02:52.905
- Good seeing you, man.
- Alright, bro.

02:53.839 --> 02:54.939
Don't go to
Britney's house, man.

02:54.941 --> 02:56.106
I'm gonna go by Jessica.

02:56.108 --> 02:57.009
Ah!

03:05.584 --> 03:06.519
Cal!

03:09.555 --> 03:11.190
Cal! You're home, man?

03:16.062 --> 03:16.963
Ma.

03:18.764 --> 03:19.664
Ma.

03:20.800 --> 03:21.700
Ma?

03:24.536 --> 03:25.470
Ma, where's Calvin?

03:28.007 --> 03:32.042
I don't know, sweetie, probably
at practice or something.

03:32.044 --> 03:33.145
He didn't call or nothing?

03:36.848 --> 03:40.018
Ma, I told you, you've got
to watch him when I'm not here.

03:44.689 --> 03:45.857
Did you get some more stuff?

03:50.662 --> 03:53.665
Dig, did you
get some more stuff?

03:58.003 --> 03:59.602
Boy, you know you
hear me talking to you.

03:59.604 --> 04:00.537
Yeah, ma.

04:01.940 --> 04:03.208
I got you a little something.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.221
Here, Ma.

04:19.589 --> 04:21.992
Always know how to take good
care of your mama, don't you?

04:59.229 --> 05:00.896
Hey, Granny?

05:00.898 --> 05:03.901
Oh, Jalen, my handsome.

05:05.369 --> 05:06.270
Hey.

05:07.804 --> 05:09.204
What are you doing out here?

05:09.206 --> 05:11.672
Oh, I just left from...
with Diggy.

05:11.674 --> 05:13.143
Yeah, I saw that.

05:17.814 --> 05:20.716
Now, I've told you before
just like I told your father,

05:22.118 --> 05:25.353
everything has a seed

05:25.355 --> 05:27.688
and if you plant trouble,

05:27.690 --> 05:29.659
trouble is what
you're going to get back.

05:32.929 --> 05:37.667
- No, I just...
- Jalen, do you want to end up like your father?

05:39.335 --> 05:41.637
You have to do right.

05:43.940 --> 05:48.209
Baby, you are one
thought away from changing

05:48.211 --> 05:52.014
your life for the good
or for the bad.

05:53.282 --> 05:55.316
- That's why I love you.
- Oh, boy.

05:55.318 --> 06:00.720
You always stand on top of me,
and you always preaching to me.

06:00.722 --> 06:01.955
I love you.

06:01.957 --> 06:02.924
I love you too.

06:04.393 --> 06:09.298
Now baby, if you do right, then I
won't be doing all this preaching.

06:11.166 --> 06:13.034
You mean everything to me.

06:15.837 --> 06:18.304
Well, listen baby I got
to going over to the church.

06:18.306 --> 06:20.041
- You want me to walk with you?
- No, I'm alright.

06:21.743 --> 06:24.310
You be good. I'm watching you.

06:24.312 --> 06:25.380
Alright.

06:55.177 --> 06:56.376
Yes.

06:56.378 --> 06:57.843
<i>I have a collect call</i>

06:57.845 --> 06:59.312
- <i>from:</i>
- <i>Aaron Davis.</i>

06:59.314 --> 07:01.914
<i>an inmate at San Bernardino</i>

07:01.916 --> 07:03.483
<i>county detention facility,</i>

07:03.485 --> 07:06.352
<i>if you would
like to accept this call...</i>

07:06.354 --> 07:07.320
- Yes, yes!
- If you would like...

07:07.322 --> 07:08.454
Yes, yes, yes!

07:08.456 --> 07:10.222
I will... Yes, yes!

07:10.224 --> 07:12.525
<i>If you would
like to accept this call...</i>

07:12.527 --> 07:14.126
Yes, I'll accept.

07:14.128 --> 07:15.427
<i>This call will be recorded</i>

07:15.429 --> 07:16.929
<i>and monitored.</i>

07:16.931 --> 07:17.865
What do you want, Aaron?

07:18.999 --> 07:20.199
Can't I just be calling
to see how you're all doing?

07:20.201 --> 07:24.036
Whenever you call it's because
you want something, Aaron.

07:24.038 --> 07:25.105
- I mean I'm trying.
- Do I...

07:26.440 --> 07:27.539
- How can...
- Just stop.

07:27.541 --> 07:28.807
Come on. Shala you know I...

07:28.809 --> 07:30.309
<i>Why are you calling me?</i>

07:30.311 --> 07:31.879
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

07:33.013 --> 07:36.181
You don't have to
do anything for me,

07:36.183 --> 07:39.917
but I'm telling you, you've got
to get your son off the streets

07:39.919 --> 07:44.023
before he's...
Before he's dead or locked up.

07:45.326 --> 07:47.959
But I'm in jail,
I can't do anything in here.

07:47.961 --> 07:48.895
Aaron...

07:50.364 --> 07:52.266
These streets
are getting worse by the day.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.034
And he doesn't
know that I know, but...

07:56.236 --> 08:00.871
Aaron he's selling drugs,
just like his father used to.

08:00.873 --> 08:03.542
If I can get out,
I can change things.

08:03.544 --> 08:06.913
<i>I promise,
but nobody is listening.</i>

08:08.549 --> 08:11.583
If I get out,
will I have a place to come to?

08:11.585 --> 08:16.256
No, no, no,
he might need you, but I don't.

08:20.860 --> 08:23.029
Well, tell my man
I said what's up, then.

08:33.339 --> 08:34.274
Hey, Ma.

08:36.376 --> 08:38.043
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

08:42.847 --> 08:45.518
- How long have you been standing there?
- Long enough.

08:48.287 --> 08:50.889
It's okay to cry, alright?

08:55.961 --> 08:59.131
Young woman, come into my office,
come on, come talk to me.

09:27.526 --> 09:30.360
- What's going on, man?
- What's up? I've missed you in and out these past few days.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.127
- I was just playing ball.
- You better be, boy.

09:32.129 --> 09:35.099
Hey, go check your room,
I got you something.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.608
- You got my uniform!
- You know it, man.

09:45.610 --> 09:47.976
- Thanks, Diggy.
- Of course, man. Hey!

09:47.978 --> 09:49.311
- Go do your homework now, man.
- I will.

09:49.313 --> 09:51.413
Hey, stop staying up so late.

09:51.415 --> 09:53.884
- I will.
- Go!

10:01.192 --> 10:02.293
God, Lord,

10:04.328 --> 10:05.963
I know you see Jalen,

10:08.032 --> 10:10.032
and I need you to intervene.

10:13.537 --> 10:17.006
I need you, Lord to intervene.

10:19.510 --> 10:23.278
Do whatever you
have to do, Lord,

10:23.280 --> 10:25.915
to get him out of those
streets, do it, Lord.

10:27.485 --> 10:29.252
I trust in you, Lord.

10:31.722 --> 10:35.959
And, Devil I serve you notice.

10:37.994 --> 10:39.329
Let him loose!

10:40.196 --> 10:42.132
He's the Lord's vessel...

10:43.701 --> 10:48.004
In Jesus name, amen.

10:49.172 --> 10:50.273
Amen.

10:52.041 --> 10:53.109
Amen.

10:54.344 --> 10:56.144
I love you, okay?

10:56.146 --> 10:57.113
I've got you.

11:01.317 --> 11:03.919
You know grandma,
I saw her on the way in.

11:05.722 --> 11:08.558
Yeah, she's trying to get
me to read the Bible and stuff.

11:10.058 --> 11:13.126
Jalen, you're her only
grandchild, what do you expect?

11:13.128 --> 11:14.497
Swear that lady is a detective.

11:16.766 --> 11:18.066
Can I ask you a question?

11:23.238 --> 11:24.541
How come you
never say you love me?

11:26.509 --> 11:27.409
Jalen?

11:32.548 --> 11:35.783
Jalen, You...
You know I love you even though

11:35.785 --> 11:40.687
I might not always
say it, so stop that.

11:40.689 --> 11:44.092
- Stop, what?
- Stop, stop, stop with all of the mushy stuff.

11:45.327 --> 11:49.429
Forgiveness
is not about anybody else.

11:49.431 --> 11:54.034
Forgiveness is a gift
that you give yourself.

11:54.036 --> 11:56.403
You've got to let go of it,
because if you don't let go

11:56.405 --> 11:58.205
of whatever the offense is,

11:58.207 --> 12:01.174
you will always
be your limitation.

12:01.176 --> 12:04.413
You are too strong
to be suffering.

12:05.414 --> 12:09.114
Only weak people
hold on to unforgiveness.

12:09.116 --> 12:11.618
God has a plan for your life,

12:11.620 --> 12:14.690
if you don't let go of it,
you'll never reach that plan.

12:15.591 --> 12:19.124
The Bible say that only
the pure in heart will see God.

12:19.126 --> 12:22.363
So whatever it takes you've
got flush all of it out of you.

12:24.398 --> 12:26.766
You've got to do it for
yourself and your future,

12:26.768 --> 12:29.738
for your children and
your children's children.

12:31.405 --> 12:33.407
Loose it and let it go today.

12:48.356 --> 12:49.457
Hey, baby.

12:50.424 --> 12:51.425
Momma.

12:54.795 --> 12:56.395
How are you?

12:56.397 --> 12:58.198
I'm keeping it together.

13:00.668 --> 13:02.035
How are you?

13:07.440 --> 13:09.442
They won't look into my case,

13:10.510 --> 13:15.048
I did not do those things
that they say I did. I didn't.

13:19.119 --> 13:20.053
That may be,

13:21.221 --> 13:26.293
but, I believe that God is going
to work this thing out.

13:28.762 --> 13:31.064
You can say that
for somebody else.

13:32.599 --> 13:35.300
Now, Aaron...

13:35.302 --> 13:39.573
you were raised in the church,
you know what to do.

13:41.608 --> 13:45.545
You have to repent
for the things you've done

13:46.746 --> 13:50.082
and you've got to
turn your life over to him.

13:52.318 --> 13:56.623
I am sorry for all the things
I've put you through, I am.

13:59.593 --> 14:01.493
I should be out there.

14:03.462 --> 14:04.396
Uh-huh.

14:05.531 --> 14:10.669
You are right where you
need to be, to hear from God.

14:11.704 --> 14:13.739
See out there was a distraction

14:14.673 --> 14:20.412
keeping you from your purpose,
from being a father to your son.

14:21.547 --> 14:25.851
If you ask anything
when you pray,

14:26.785 --> 14:31.156
it will be done
if you have faith.

14:35.728 --> 14:38.462
On your way back to the cell.

14:38.464 --> 14:41.500
- Time's up, All inmates let's go.
- Now I got to go.

14:43.936 --> 14:45.301
All inmates let's go.

14:45.303 --> 14:46.703
I love you.

14:46.705 --> 14:49.675
I love you. You got to go.

15:16.868 --> 15:20.970
- <i>A federal Judge in California has denied...</i>
- <i>Aaron Davis's appeal for his</i>

15:20.972 --> 15:23.906

<i>...after the murders.

15:45.797 --> 15:46.898
Hello, Davis?

15:48.365 --> 15:50.267
Your woman ain't
waiting on you, bro.

15:55.006 --> 15:57.305
You always get upset,
but so do I because it always

15:57.307 --> 15:59.808
feels like I keep
telling you the same thing

15:59.810 --> 16:01.810
- I know, mom.
- over and over.

16:01.812 --> 16:03.745
All you want to do is
run the street, chase girls.

16:03.747 --> 16:06.314
That's what you do.
That's not what life is about?

16:06.316 --> 16:08.316
You think I want to spend
my time lecturing you?

16:08.318 --> 16:11.019
I don't, but I'm
trying to tell you what's right.

16:11.021 --> 16:13.354
Here, just...
It will only take me a minute.

16:13.356 --> 16:15.423
- Just get in there.
- I will be right over there, okay?

16:15.425 --> 16:16.693
Okay.

16:19.930 --> 16:22.997
- Hi, how can I help you, ma'am.
- Hi, I'm here to see Ms. Davis.

16:22.999 --> 16:24.735
- May I ask your name?
- Shala Davis.

16:26.970 --> 16:28.805
Hi, Shala Davis
is here to see you.

16:29.773 --> 16:31.673
Great, she'll be right with you.

16:31.675 --> 16:32.575
Thank you.

17:04.839 --> 17:07.643
Come on, you got this, just...

17:08.978 --> 17:10.679
Over here.

17:16.819 --> 17:19.819
<i>♪ God is love</i>

17:19.821 --> 17:22.290
<i>♪ God is love</i>

17:23.692 --> 17:27.328
<i>♪ I can feel him all around us</i>

17:30.698 --> 17:32.565
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Just relax, okay.

17:32.567 --> 17:33.903
I can play it for you.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.538
Were you
listening this whole time?

17:39.008 --> 17:40.009
May I?

17:41.476 --> 17:42.710
Sure.

17:44.180 --> 17:48.616
I'm not really a singer, but I can
do what you do, okay? Let me see.

17:53.388 --> 17:54.887
Let me see if I got this.

17:54.889 --> 17:58.057
Alright, so...
You repeat that first line,

17:58.059 --> 17:59.926
you were saying
God is love, right.

17:59.928 --> 18:02.028
Just repeat it,
and maybe speed it up a little.

18:02.030 --> 18:03.531
Okay.

18:05.399 --> 18:07.334
<i>♪ God is love</i>

18:08.703 --> 18:10.872
<i>♪ God is love</i>

18:12.040 --> 18:14.508
- <i>♪ God is love</i>
- <i>♪ God is love</i>

18:15.643 --> 18:17.979
<i>♪ God is love</i>

18:19.546 --> 18:23.417
<i>♪ I can feel him all around us</i>

18:24.751 --> 18:25.918
Wow!

18:25.920 --> 18:28.154
You got some talent.

18:28.156 --> 18:30.056
- Thank you.
- You're a beast.

18:30.058 --> 18:31.823
You wrote a verse
for the chorus yet?

18:31.825 --> 18:33.692
I have, yeah.

18:33.694 --> 18:36.494
- It's going to be a beautiful song.
- Thank you.

18:36.496 --> 18:39.664
I'm not really into
the whole gospel thing,

18:39.666 --> 18:41.535
but I appreciate it
when I hear it.

18:43.036 --> 18:45.437
- I'm Jalen by the way.
- Paris.

18:45.439 --> 18:46.905
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

18:46.907 --> 18:49.574
And gospel is
the best music in the world.

18:49.576 --> 18:52.177
You clearly don't
listen to rap, okay?

18:52.179 --> 18:54.179
Yeah, not really.

18:54.181 --> 18:55.680
Are you a rapper?

18:55.682 --> 18:58.516
You don't sound like a rapper.

18:58.518 --> 19:01.518
Actually, I am not.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.188
I just like listening to it.

19:03.190 --> 19:04.124
That's cool.

19:05.826 --> 19:10.494
I'm here almost every day, and
I've never seen you here before.

19:10.496 --> 19:12.730
My grandma works here.

19:12.732 --> 19:16.201
My mom's car won't start,
so we have to use hers.

19:16.203 --> 19:19.470
That's why I'm here. A little
bit too much information.

19:19.472 --> 19:21.973
- That's good.
- It looks like I may have a good reason

19:21.975 --> 19:24.410
to come back
a little bit more often.

19:26.746 --> 19:29.079
- Who is your grandma?
- Camilla Davis.

19:29.081 --> 19:31.715
- Oh, that's my music teacher.
- No way?

19:31.717 --> 19:34.752
- Yeah. She is the best.
- She's is amazing, right?

19:34.754 --> 19:36.088
Yeah.

19:38.524 --> 19:40.257
Can I have
my guitar back, please?

19:40.259 --> 19:42.161
Oh, sorry.

19:43.229 --> 19:44.430
Thank you.

19:45.564 --> 19:47.831
My dad is a counselor here too.

19:47.833 --> 19:49.867
So whenever he's
teaching a class,

19:49.869 --> 19:52.236
I go to her after-school
music program,

19:52.238 --> 19:55.239
or I hang here
until my dad is done.

19:55.241 --> 19:57.041
Why don't you just go home?

19:57.043 --> 19:58.709
My mom died when I was 12,

19:58.711 --> 20:01.180
so there is no one
to really go home to.

20:02.048 --> 20:03.049
Sorry to hear that.

20:04.083 --> 20:07.017
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

20:07.019 --> 20:09.686
I don't know why people
always get so weirded out,

20:09.688 --> 20:12.889
and feels sorry for me
when I tell them my mom died.

20:12.891 --> 20:15.527
Well, maybe because they should.

20:16.295 --> 20:20.166
That's moms, I couldn't imagine.

20:21.566 --> 20:22.901
Moms are everything, you know?

20:24.602 --> 20:25.570
Yeah.

20:26.938 --> 20:31.509
She was pretty awesome,
and I miss her,

20:33.945 --> 20:36.748
but, you know,
dads are important too.

20:38.116 --> 20:41.786
I wouldn't really know.
I don't know my father.

20:42.787 --> 20:45.989
- Uh, you know what? I'm gonna have to run.
- Sorry about that.

20:45.991 --> 20:48.623
- I'll see you guys tomorrow at three, right?
- Yeah.

20:48.625 --> 20:49.658
- Bye.
- Thanks, Mr. Monty.

20:49.660 --> 20:50.994
Speaking of fathers...

20:50.996 --> 20:52.295
- Hi, Dad.
- Who is this?

20:52.297 --> 20:54.330
- Hi, Daddy, how are you?
- Hey.

20:54.332 --> 20:55.797
Listen, I'm sorry, baby.

20:55.799 --> 20:57.300
The meeting ran over, you know.

20:57.302 --> 20:59.035
Daddy, you say that every day.

20:59.037 --> 21:01.204
How was school?

21:01.206 --> 21:04.109
It was good. Same old, same old.
Aced that math test, though.

21:05.609 --> 21:08.010
- What's up.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

21:08.012 --> 21:10.979
How rude of me. Uhm,
Daddy, this is my friend.

21:10.981 --> 21:12.914
How are you doing?
I'm Jalen, man.

21:12.916 --> 21:15.152
Yeah. You can call me Mr. Monty.

21:19.189 --> 21:21.189
Looks like you have
a bit of a wardrobe

21:21.191 --> 21:23.627
malfunction there, son,
with your pants.

21:24.628 --> 21:26.597
- No, I'm good.
- No, no, no in the back.

21:28.332 --> 21:29.931
- This.
- Hey, man!

21:29.933 --> 21:31.066
- Exposure.
- Chill!

21:31.068 --> 21:33.237
Take your hands off my son!

21:34.604 --> 21:36.604
Come on, Jalen. Let's go.

21:36.606 --> 21:37.607
Come on, let's go.

21:38.909 --> 21:40.608
What did I tell you about hanging
out with those knuckleheads?

21:40.610 --> 21:41.611
Seriously, Daddy?

21:51.687 --> 21:54.222
- What's up, Diggy?
- Tony.

21:54.224 --> 21:56.058
I've been calling
your phone all day.

21:56.060 --> 21:58.726
My bad, man. My ringer
was off. You know how it is.

21:58.728 --> 22:00.164
I was at school,
we can't have them on.

22:01.064 --> 22:02.763
Why do you got
the phone at school then?

22:02.765 --> 22:03.733
Safety, man.

22:06.403 --> 22:09.138
Look, man, where is my money?

22:11.207 --> 22:12.740
I don't have it, you see.

22:12.742 --> 22:15.342
Where is Tara at?
You're keeping her nice?

22:15.344 --> 22:16.944
My mom has got
nothing to do with this, man.

22:16.946 --> 22:19.680
- What did you say?
- I got it, though.

22:19.682 --> 22:20.781
I got it, bro.

22:20.783 --> 22:22.183
It's just not on me.

22:22.185 --> 22:24.151
See, tomorrow, man.

22:24.153 --> 22:25.719
I promise, man.

22:25.721 --> 22:26.656
I will get it for y'all.

22:27.390 --> 22:28.291
Come here, Diggy.

22:29.325 --> 22:30.259
Come here, man!

22:32.028 --> 22:33.027
Look.

22:33.029 --> 22:34.663
I like you, alright?

22:35.431 --> 22:36.899
I really do.

22:38.733 --> 22:41.603
Now, if you don't have
that money by tomorrow...

22:42.737 --> 22:46.775
- Pow.
- Understand?

22:47.776 --> 22:49.343
Yeah, man.

22:49.345 --> 22:53.980
I'll see you tomorrow, alright?
Let's roll, Dread.

22:53.982 --> 22:55.150
Make sure you answer your phone.

23:13.969 --> 23:14.936
Dear, Lord.

23:16.972 --> 23:18.039
Help him.

23:19.241 --> 23:20.909
Bring him out.

23:21.877 --> 23:26.012
Free him from all captivity

23:26.014 --> 23:30.018
mental and
spiritual and physical.

23:30.918 --> 23:36.722
I pray in faith
that you will uncover every

23:36.724 --> 23:41.760
hidden thing that
the enemy has tried to cover.

23:41.762 --> 23:43.463
Hello, Davis.

23:43.465 --> 23:46.064
You're in here for life, man.
Don't forget that.

23:46.066 --> 23:48.501
You failed him
miserably,

23:48.503 --> 23:51.236
because he is now living just
like you without his father.

23:51.238 --> 23:54.273
What did you say? What did you tell me?
I got you, baby, I got you.

23:54.275 --> 23:56.442
You got me stuck.

23:56.444 --> 23:58.045
Jalen! Go!

24:03.951 --> 24:05.719
Go, man, go!

24:10.958 --> 24:13.892
You were
raised in the Church.

24:13.894 --> 24:15.095
You know what to do.

24:31.110 --> 24:33.214
- You embarrassed me, Dad.
- What?

24:35.148 --> 24:38.049
Look, I just came up
to see how you're doing.

24:38.051 --> 24:41.152
I had been waiting for you
all day, and all of a sudden,

24:41.154 --> 24:43.955
when I started talking to Jalen,
oh, now I have your attention?

24:43.957 --> 24:45.024
No.

24:46.993 --> 24:49.429
Look, baby.
You know I get busy sometimes.

24:50.564 --> 24:52.897
Listen, sweetie, you know...
You know you are my world.

24:52.899 --> 24:58.004
- My world, and there is nothing without you.
- What is wrong?

25:01.040 --> 25:06.412
Baby, what's going on, huh?
Paris, are you missing your mom?

25:10.550 --> 25:15.188
I'll tell you what. I will start
picking you up after school, alright?

25:16.122 --> 25:20.424
Now, I have to work on my schedule
and it might be a bit of a stretch

25:20.426 --> 25:24.096
- but I'll make it happen.
- Never mind, Dad.

25:25.998 --> 25:28.366
- Baby, what do you want?
- I want my dad!

25:28.368 --> 25:30.233
- You have me!
- For what?

25:30.235 --> 25:32.969
The one hour
in the morning before school?

25:32.971 --> 25:34.605
The 30-minute car ride home?

25:34.607 --> 25:36.973
Your weekends are
consumed with your stupid

25:36.975 --> 25:40.145
weekend conferences
and your book signings.

25:41.079 --> 25:44.414
Okay, cool. Saturday we eat at grandma's
house, but by the time Sunday

25:44.416 --> 25:47.617
comes around, you're too busy
with football and basketball.

25:47.619 --> 25:50.789
And here comes Monday and
the cycle starts all over again.

25:53.025 --> 25:55.260
I'm tired
of sharing you with everybody.

26:00.599 --> 26:02.065
You have me, baby.

26:02.067 --> 26:03.934
I promise, alright?

26:05.270 --> 26:08.507
Just let daddy take care of
a few things.

26:09.608 --> 26:12.143
That's what you said last
time and the time before that.

26:58.622 --> 27:01.323
<i>Hey, daddy.</i>

27:01.325 --> 27:03.991
<i>Listen, now's not a good time.</i>

27:03.993 --> 27:05.095
Let's go!

27:07.130 --> 27:10.064
- Daddy is getting ready to start a session.
- <i>Again?</i>

27:10.066 --> 27:11.667
Yes. I know, sweetheart.

27:11.669 --> 27:13.669
- <i>Seriously?</i>
- I know, I know.

27:13.671 --> 27:15.604
- <i>I'm just gonna go.</i>
- What?

27:15.606 --> 27:18.005
- <i>I'll find a ride.</i>
- A ride in the middle...

27:18.007 --> 27:20.241
- <i>Whatever.</i>
- Hello.

27:20.243 --> 27:22.443
Hello.

27:22.445 --> 27:25.148
She hung up on me.

27:31.588 --> 27:33.521
Uh, first of all,
I'd like to thank you all for

27:33.523 --> 27:36.657
agreeing to be part of
this program for inmates.

27:36.659 --> 27:39.127
Alright,
I commend you for taking that

27:39.129 --> 27:41.529
first step
to being better fathers.

27:41.531 --> 27:43.698
Now, I'm gonna give you
the information

27:43.700 --> 27:47.435
to be better fathers
to your kids.

27:47.437 --> 27:51.037
Now I spoke to the warden
and he gave me clearance

27:51.039 --> 27:55.443
for your children and, or your children's
mothers to be part of the program.

27:55.445 --> 27:58.279
I already know my baby
and momma ain't coming.

27:58.281 --> 27:59.449
She's the reason I'm in here.

28:00.316 --> 28:03.083
Can we throw in
some conjugal visits?

28:06.121 --> 28:08.054
When you leave this class,

28:08.056 --> 28:12.161
you're gonna be happy that
you came and overall better men.

28:13.095 --> 28:18.064
This class is offered in order for
you to get honest with yourselves.

28:18.066 --> 28:19.301
And how about you?

28:21.003 --> 28:22.971
Can you take
an honest look at yourself?

28:31.413 --> 28:34.683
And you must be
Aaron Davis, right?

28:36.652 --> 28:38.752
Yeah, that's my name.

28:38.754 --> 28:41.022
Just didn't answer
the question, though.

28:42.257 --> 28:44.224
Can you be real?

28:44.226 --> 28:47.761
Well, you see, Aaron, uhm.

28:47.763 --> 28:49.465
This isn't about me.

28:50.399 --> 28:53.667
You see, I'm not
the one sitting in your seat.

28:53.669 --> 28:56.436
Yeah, but you want
to know our stories.

28:56.438 --> 28:57.671
Each and every one of you

28:57.673 --> 28:59.606
should look at your neighbor

28:59.608 --> 29:01.242
and speak the truth.

29:03.444 --> 29:05.580
For we are
members one of another.

29:06.715 --> 29:09.415
- What did that dude say?
- Thank you. Thank you, brother.

29:09.417 --> 29:12.218
- What's up with you, bro?
- Wo, wo. Let's bring it in.

29:12.220 --> 29:14.222
- Bring it in, fellows.
- My name is Randy.

29:15.389 --> 29:17.091
I speak what's given to me.

29:20.461 --> 29:23.796
Tsk.
So you know a few scriptures,

29:23.798 --> 29:26.732
so what?
Ain't nothing special about you.

29:26.734 --> 29:29.103
Oh, so you know scriptures?

29:30.505 --> 29:33.541
You answer my questions,
and I'll answer yours.

29:35.576 --> 29:38.277
Alright, Aaron. I can do that.

29:38.279 --> 29:39.413
I can be honest.

29:43.149 --> 29:44.750
Guess class can start, guys.

29:44.752 --> 29:45.653
Yeah.

29:47.488 --> 29:48.687
Well, thank you, Aaron.

29:48.689 --> 29:50.290
Ah, let's try this again.

29:51.424 --> 29:54.760
My name is Monty
and I'm from Chicago.

29:54.762 --> 29:58.363
Shut up, hey!

29:58.365 --> 29:59.865
Hey! Hey!

29:59.867 --> 30:02.600
Put your hand down, fool,
before I break some.

30:02.602 --> 30:05.472
Uh-uh, uh-uh. Not here.

30:08.408 --> 30:13.146
Now that will be the first
and last warning, gentlemen.

30:22.489 --> 30:28.793
Okay, so I moved here in 1992,
to teach at the university.

30:28.795 --> 30:33.464
I taught psychology for 10 years, and
I still do it from time to time.

30:33.466 --> 30:37.267
Hey, man, when do you
find time for your own daughter?

30:43.142 --> 30:47.079
Well, that's, uh, it's really
none of your business.

30:48.815 --> 30:51.250
For your information, I have
plenty of time for my daughter.

30:52.518 --> 30:55.454
So When was the last time you took
your little princess for ice cream?

31:01.894 --> 31:05.130
Bet you never considered the fact
that I might be innocent, huh?

31:07.466 --> 31:08.865
That punk cracked him.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.468
Running around
like he is innocent.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.670
The police know too. They know.

31:13.672 --> 31:14.905
They ain't going
to do nothing about it.

31:14.907 --> 31:15.874
And neither will he.

31:16.942 --> 31:21.177
Sitting behind this
little podium, judging us.

31:21.179 --> 31:23.747
Trying to show us
how to be fathers.

31:23.749 --> 31:27.216
Ain't no difference
between me and you, partner.

31:27.218 --> 31:29.519
These people always
come here and lie to us.

31:29.521 --> 31:31.690
We're tired of being lied to.

31:32.791 --> 31:34.791
We won't walk out of here,

31:34.793 --> 31:37.193
until you could start
being honest with us.

31:51.309 --> 31:52.543
Tsk.

31:58.816 --> 32:02.186
I haven't been a very good
father to my daughter.

32:03.955 --> 32:07.990
I don't spend time
with her like I should.

32:07.992 --> 32:10.628
And I know that's what she wants,
but I can't give it to her.

32:12.797 --> 32:18.435
I can see the hurt in her eyes,
yet I choose to ignore it.

32:23.273 --> 32:27.242
You see,
when I look at my daughter,

32:27.244 --> 32:32.514
she reminds me
of my late wife, Erica,

32:32.516 --> 32:33.851
and how much I miss her.

32:37.754 --> 32:39.756
She died when
my daughter was 12.

32:43.960 --> 32:46.763
The older she gets, the
more she looks like her mother.

32:48.999 --> 32:53.270
Her smiles, her laugh, her eyes.

32:56.006 --> 33:03.279
She is a constant reminder
that my Erica is gone forever.

33:09.953 --> 33:11.320
The truth is...

33:12.889 --> 33:17.560
I have... I haven't gotten
over the death of my wife,

33:25.735 --> 33:26.937
but there it is.

34:04.073 --> 34:05.273
Thank you.

34:07.810 --> 34:09.277
Thank you, guys.

34:22.757 --> 34:24.791
What you doing out here?

34:24.793 --> 34:26.993
Oh, hey.

34:26.995 --> 34:30.362
I'm just taking
some time to myself.

34:30.364 --> 34:32.600
It's my favorite place
to come relax and read.

34:34.668 --> 34:38.306
It's getting dark. You should probably
be getting back to the church.

34:39.674 --> 34:40.975
Let me walk you.

34:43.043 --> 34:44.911
On one condition.

34:44.913 --> 34:46.612
What's that?

34:46.614 --> 34:48.815
Come sit and talk
with me for a bit.

34:48.817 --> 34:51.382
I can't resist that,
so I'm going to sit right there.

34:55.989 --> 34:57.892
So, how was your day?

35:03.131 --> 35:04.933
No one ever really asks me that.

35:06.868 --> 35:09.168
- Feels nice.
- Really?

35:09.170 --> 35:10.637
Yeah.

35:12.040 --> 35:18.610
Well, I promise to ask you how your
day goes every time I see you.

35:18.612 --> 35:21.316
Really, does that mean you're
going to be seeing me a lot?

35:23.050 --> 35:24.183
It depends.

35:24.185 --> 35:25.951
Depends on what?

35:25.953 --> 35:29.154
If we could meet here
sometimes after school,

35:29.156 --> 35:32.359
I'll tell you about my day
and you tell me about yours.

35:33.627 --> 35:35.829
I like that, I'm cool with that.

35:38.431 --> 35:40.667
You're different from the other
chicks I've been messing with.

35:42.803 --> 35:45.804
- Excuse me?
- No, that came...

35:45.806 --> 35:48.539
Chicks lay eggs, Jalen.

35:48.541 --> 35:51.910
You couldn't find a different
word to describe a female?

35:51.912 --> 35:53.713
That's how you see me, a chick?

35:54.714 --> 35:57.048
And who says that we're
messing with each other?

35:57.050 --> 35:58.582
I didn't mean
to say it like that.

35:58.584 --> 35:59.783
- Is that all you want?
- Eh, eh...

35:59.785 --> 36:02.822
- Eh, eh.
- Eh...

36:05.225 --> 36:08.559
- Got you!
- Oh, man!

36:08.561 --> 36:10.195
I had a mini-heart attack
right there.

36:10.197 --> 36:13.597
- I could tell.
- Oh, my goodness, you're funny.

36:15.235 --> 36:17.835
I like it, though.

36:17.837 --> 36:19.705
Rivers run deep with you.

36:23.175 --> 36:25.711
Come on, we should be
getting back to the church.

36:26.913 --> 36:30.116
Just so you know,
you're not alone.

36:31.751 --> 36:34.787
I've felt that type of way about my
father not being there for me either.

36:36.088 --> 36:39.690
Really? Thought your father
is in your life.

36:39.692 --> 36:42.895
My dad lives with me,

36:44.529 --> 36:48.433
he provides for me,
but he isn't there for me.

36:49.868 --> 36:51.070
There's a difference.

36:52.604 --> 36:54.238
Wow.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.173
You know
I always took your father

36:56.175 --> 37:00.445
to be the type to take you
on long walks on the beach,

37:01.546 --> 37:04.681
daddy-daughter dates,
mani-pedis together.

37:04.683 --> 37:08.486
No, I wish.

37:09.554 --> 37:12.190
I couldn't tell you the last time
we've done anything like that.

37:13.758 --> 37:15.593
Do you ever try
to just talk to him?

37:16.861 --> 37:20.730
No, you know,
I would feel guilty

37:20.732 --> 37:24.169
taking him away
from people who need him.

37:26.171 --> 37:28.173
At least you've got access
to your pops,

37:29.808 --> 37:32.175
I never had that privilege.

37:32.177 --> 37:35.044
You know, my mom has tried to
hook me up with some of my uncles

37:35.046 --> 37:37.679
and some of her
close guy friends,

37:37.681 --> 37:40.183
that never really worked out.

37:40.185 --> 37:41.152
Why not?

37:49.793 --> 37:54.830
So, my moms...
None of her attempts

37:54.832 --> 37:56.898
ever really worked out,

37:56.900 --> 37:59.970
most of the dudes was trying
to hook up with her anyways,

38:01.171 --> 38:05.909
except this one,
his motives was all wrong.

38:07.344 --> 38:08.979
What happened?

38:14.852 --> 38:17.221
If you don't want to talk about
it, Jalen you don't have to.

38:24.061 --> 38:25.561
No, it's cool.

38:26.763 --> 38:30.134
So... this one cat

38:31.901 --> 38:33.601
says he wants to take me hiking.

38:33.603 --> 38:36.206
He told my mom
he'll be like my big bro.

38:39.842 --> 38:43.713
Took me to this lake
in the middle of nowhere.

38:48.951 --> 38:53.656
Jalen, it's okay
you can talk to me,

38:54.657 --> 38:56.125
you're safe with me.

39:01.064 --> 39:03.066
So he takes me to this lake

39:04.667 --> 39:06.002
in the middle of nowhere,

39:07.170 --> 39:09.205
starts taking off his clothes

39:11.874 --> 39:14.041
and he told me to get in.

39:14.043 --> 39:15.812
I had bad vibes,

39:17.313 --> 39:20.216
but he assured me that
everything was fine, you know.

39:22.251 --> 39:24.020
Back then I couldn't swim.

39:24.886 --> 39:26.786
He said he would
teach me how to swim.

39:26.788 --> 39:29.158
So I'm like,
"Cool, you're like my big bro."

39:31.660 --> 39:33.329
As soon as I get in the water,

39:35.198 --> 39:36.665
he's all up on me.

39:38.767 --> 39:41.937
Didn't feel right,
so I got out ASAP.

39:43.071 --> 39:46.706
Got all my clothes on
soaking wet

39:46.708 --> 39:48.408
then he starts screaming at me,

39:48.410 --> 39:50.745
"Get back in the lake
or I'm gonna leave you here."

39:52.214 --> 39:53.882
I didn't know what to do, so...

39:54.816 --> 39:56.651
I just ran into the woods.

39:57.886 --> 40:01.020
And I just walked
and walked and walked

40:01.022 --> 40:02.324
till it was dark.

40:05.227 --> 40:07.994
Back then I watched
a lot of scary movies.

40:07.996 --> 40:10.096
You know what happens to
people like us in the woods.

40:10.098 --> 40:12.633
I was scared,

40:13.801 --> 40:14.735
but luckily...

40:17.004 --> 40:21.374
Just like a miracle,
I heard these girls camping out.

40:21.376 --> 40:22.776
They took me home.

40:24.212 --> 40:27.382
Wow, Jalen, I'm so sorry
you had to go through that.

40:30.918 --> 40:32.953
You had to be really brave.

40:35.289 --> 40:36.924
How old were you?

40:38.926 --> 40:41.028
I was eight years old.

40:43.430 --> 40:45.898
You know,
I can't help but think,

40:45.900 --> 40:49.069
if my father was in my life, that
things would be different, you know.

41:04.318 --> 41:06.686
I never told anybody that story.

41:07.488 --> 41:09.454
You the first
and the last, alright?

41:14.994 --> 41:16.930
I hope you know
you're safe with me.

41:19.400 --> 41:20.800
I know, Paris.

41:28.341 --> 41:33.112
You know how they say
God has a plan for all of us?

41:37.517 --> 41:41.754
Something is telling me
God has a plan for you and I.

41:45.959 --> 41:49.060
He is bringing us together,
to help us understand

41:49.062 --> 41:51.931
our fathers,
and to forgive them.

41:53.865 --> 41:54.968
You really think so?

41:57.869 --> 41:58.937
Yeah.

42:02.941 --> 42:05.809
My guitar, my guitar.

42:05.811 --> 42:07.247
Oh, shoot.

42:11.817 --> 42:13.451
Child, what are
you still doing here?

42:13.453 --> 42:16.086
I'm sorry,
I'm still waiting for my dad.

42:16.088 --> 42:17.555
- Hey, Paris.
- Hey, girls.

42:17.557 --> 42:19.256
What's up?

42:19.258 --> 42:21.324
Wondering around
at night isn't safe, you know?

42:21.326 --> 42:24.461
I know, but I wasn't by myself.

42:24.463 --> 42:25.797
Oh?

42:27.866 --> 42:29.167
Well, who were you with?

42:30.335 --> 42:32.537
And does Mr. Monty know him?

42:33.472 --> 42:35.905
Yes, he's actually
already met him.

42:35.907 --> 42:38.475
But does he know that you're
gallivanting around at nights

42:38.477 --> 42:41.511
- with him, though?
- It's not like that, Ms. Davis,

42:41.513 --> 42:44.782
- He's actually your grandson.
- Who?

42:45.883 --> 42:49.521
- Jalen.
- Oh, Lord Jesus.

42:50.422 --> 42:51.920
I got to pray about this.

42:51.922 --> 42:54.257
- What, Ms... You guys.
- Tell her.

42:54.259 --> 42:57.092
- You didn't tell us you had a new boyfriend.
- Help me out, please.

42:57.094 --> 42:59.163
And what is she
supposed to help you out with?

43:00.164 --> 43:02.898
I don't know anything,
Ms. Davis. Nothing.

43:02.900 --> 43:05.034
Sorry, Miss Davis,
I didn't know either.

43:05.036 --> 43:06.603
You guys are the worst.

43:06.605 --> 43:10.105
I just came for my guitar, jeez.

43:10.107 --> 43:12.941
I'll tell you.
Let's go over this song again.

43:12.943 --> 43:14.543
We've got
about 10 minutes, and Paris,

43:14.545 --> 43:16.514
- why don't you practice with us?
- Okay.

43:20.384 --> 43:21.617
Okay, here we go.

43:21.619 --> 43:23.986
One, two three.

43:23.988 --> 43:29.224
<i>♪ Amazing grace</i>

43:29.226 --> 43:34.929
<i>♪ How sweet the sound</i>

43:34.931 --> 43:40.602
<i>♪ That saved a wretch</i>

43:40.604 --> 43:43.407
<i>♪ Like me</i>

43:45.643 --> 43:49.143
Our Father who art in heaven.

43:49.145 --> 43:51.145
Hollowed be Thy name.

43:51.147 --> 43:53.114
- Thy kingdom come...
- You must understand

43:53.116 --> 43:56.554
that when God created you,
he created you to be great.

43:58.054 --> 44:00.290
Greatness is in your DNA.

44:02.058 --> 44:05.259
Yes, there may have been things
that happened in your past,

44:05.261 --> 44:09.030
and some things
that were beyond your control.

44:09.032 --> 44:12.066
Don't allow your past
to defeat you.

44:12.068 --> 44:18.272
In spite of your weakness, you owe it to
yourself to choose victory over defeat.

44:18.274 --> 44:20.074
In spite of what
you've been through,

44:20.076 --> 44:24.011
you owe it to yourself to win,
and say, "I can make it.

44:24.013 --> 44:27.115
I will win. I am a champion."

44:27.117 --> 44:31.652
I know the Devil told you you will
never make it. The Devil is a liar.

44:31.654 --> 44:35.356
When people say, "You can't"
you say, "I can".

44:35.358 --> 44:39.360
When the Devil says
you can't, you say I can.

44:39.362 --> 44:43.731
I can! A struggle
can't hold me! I can!

44:43.733 --> 44:49.670
Now, if you choose victory, clap your
hands, and give God some praise.

44:54.376 --> 44:56.343
Thy kingdom come.

44:56.345 --> 44:59.045
Thy will be done, on earth...

44:59.047 --> 45:00.715
<i>You've reached
attorney Jacksons Office,</i>

45:00.717 --> 45:02.983
<i>please leave a message.</i>

45:02.985 --> 45:05.552
<i>Listen, Manuel,
you're going to think I'm crazy,</i>

45:05.554 --> 45:08.288
<i>but I had
this vision last night.</i>

45:08.290 --> 45:10.724
<i>God has a calling for me.</i>

45:10.726 --> 45:13.529
<i>It... Just meet me at
the jail house later.</i>

45:15.397 --> 45:17.230
This case is political, Monty.

45:17.232 --> 45:20.434
A child and an elderly woman
were shot dead.

45:20.436 --> 45:22.502
People want to see
someone pay for this.

45:22.504 --> 45:25.272
Are you certain
that he's innocent?

45:25.274 --> 45:26.339
Yes.

45:26.341 --> 45:28.107
Yeah, I'm sure.

45:28.109 --> 45:30.644
I mean,
this man may be a lot of things,

45:30.646 --> 45:32.414
but I'm telling you
he's not a liar.

45:33.749 --> 45:36.483
You should see the way
these men look up to him.

45:36.485 --> 45:39.351
He's a gang leader,
Monty, I looked in his file.

45:39.353 --> 45:44.323
Yet, what if that same power,
that same leadership quality

45:44.325 --> 45:46.260
can be used for something good?

45:52.433 --> 45:53.968
I think it's worth a shot.

45:56.070 --> 45:57.638
You better be right
about this, Monty.

46:06.481 --> 46:08.049
Hey.

46:09.116 --> 46:11.319
What is this about? Who is he?

46:14.655 --> 46:15.723
Manuel Jackson.

46:18.392 --> 46:21.696
I'm a defense attorney
and a good friend of Monty's.

46:24.532 --> 46:26.331
He gave me a file.

46:26.333 --> 46:29.668
I must admit,
I see some major discrepancies

46:29.670 --> 46:32.203
that went overlooked.

46:32.205 --> 46:34.040
I'm listening, go ahead.

46:34.775 --> 46:36.709
What he's saying is

46:36.711 --> 46:38.309
he's going
to look into your case

46:38.311 --> 46:40.411
present new evidence

46:40.413 --> 46:42.480
and maybe
get the charges dropped.

46:42.482 --> 46:45.583
I'm not one hundred percent certain
I can get you out of here,

46:45.585 --> 46:49.256
but I do believe there's
a good chance that I can.

46:50.824 --> 46:52.325
Don't play with me.

46:53.660 --> 46:56.062
I just need to
ask you one question.

46:58.398 --> 47:00.431
Did you rob
that convenience store

47:00.433 --> 47:02.569
and kill that little girl
and that cashier?

47:05.639 --> 47:08.408
I did not rob the store,
or kill any of those people.

47:13.312 --> 47:15.281
So you're 100% innocent?

47:21.253 --> 47:23.422
I'm 100% innocent, sir.

47:30.329 --> 47:32.398
I do not like to be
made a fool of in court.

47:35.568 --> 47:37.701
I got a reputation to uphold,

47:37.703 --> 47:39.572
so if I find out
you're lying to me...

47:43.442 --> 47:45.277
You think this is hell?

47:46.612 --> 47:50.583
I will turn up the heat.
Understood?

47:59.325 --> 48:00.659
Understood, sir.

48:04.830 --> 48:06.331
Well, then.

48:08.299 --> 48:12.401
Sir, you've got yourself
a defense attorney.

48:12.403 --> 48:14.238
I don't have any money
to pay for this.

48:18.877 --> 48:20.813
Brother, I did not
ask you for any money.

48:23.849 --> 48:25.116
Thank you.

48:26.284 --> 48:27.518
Thank you, both.

49:09.927 --> 49:11.395
Game points?

49:18.402 --> 49:20.735
I won, baby, let's go.

49:20.737 --> 49:22.337
Okay.

49:22.339 --> 49:23.774
Yo! Yo, J?

49:25.676 --> 49:28.276
What's good? What's up with you?

49:28.278 --> 49:29.577
What happened
to you last night, bro?

49:29.579 --> 49:31.680
Oh, man, Aaron called the crib,

49:31.682 --> 49:34.249
told my moms
he may be getting out.

49:34.251 --> 49:35.684
Just been thinking.

49:35.686 --> 49:38.187
Thinking? Thinking of what, man?

49:40.490 --> 49:44.559
Bro, why are you always so extra
when I bring up Aaron's name?

49:44.561 --> 49:47.696
Cos he's a liar, bro.
They're all the same, man.

49:47.698 --> 49:49.700
Talking about they gonna
do better when they get out.

49:50.701 --> 49:52.636
I remember when my
sperm donor got out.

49:55.939 --> 49:59.442
Yo, I've never even
heard my father speak.

50:01.410 --> 50:02.609
It's a cold world, man.

50:02.611 --> 50:04.346
Man, let's hoop, man.

50:06.817 --> 50:09.452
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Thanks for meeting me.

50:12.822 --> 50:14.890
I think this is the piece
of evidence we've needed.

50:19.795 --> 50:23.831
What am I not understanding, the police already
matched the same tread to Aaron shoes.

50:23.833 --> 50:27.367
They matched the same tread,
yes, but not the size.

50:27.369 --> 50:29.436
Whoever was there
that night, look closer.

50:29.438 --> 50:32.475
They wore a size nine,
Aaron wears a size 11.

50:35.478 --> 50:39.780
- Look at this.
- Who is Craig Matheson?

50:39.782 --> 50:43.316
Craig Matheson was picked up four
days after Aaron for burglary.

50:43.318 --> 50:46.452
The fun fact, they were both
wearing the same brand of shoes

50:46.454 --> 50:47.957
but guess what size he wears?

50:56.598 --> 50:58.366
I think you were
right about Aaron.

50:59.567 --> 51:00.635
Let's go and get
him out of there.

51:05.507 --> 51:08.075
Waited at that bus station
for four hours, man.

51:08.077 --> 51:10.009
Punk never showed up.

51:10.011 --> 51:11.844
So I just do my pops.

51:11.846 --> 51:13.715
I still don't know
where that cat is.

51:15.850 --> 51:19.485
- Yo, man. Can I get that?
- Maybe it's our ball.

51:19.487 --> 51:21.623
- Who're these cats, man?
- I don't know, they're some old heads, man.

51:23.658 --> 51:26.092
I heard a little bit of the conversation
you was having with your man.

51:26.094 --> 51:28.027
Oh, is that right?

51:28.029 --> 51:29.361
I was just like you, man.

51:29.363 --> 51:30.665
Man, you don't know me.

51:31.833 --> 51:36.368
Mad at my pops for leaving
my moms, hated that dude.

51:36.370 --> 51:37.538
Hated him,

51:38.640 --> 51:39.874
till one day,

51:41.075 --> 51:45.510
this dude on his dying bed in
the hospital, he calls me.

51:45.512 --> 51:50.051
It took everything in me, man, not
to just let him die and rot in hell.

51:52.386 --> 51:53.854
I had questions,

51:56.390 --> 51:58.458
long story short,
you know what he told me?

52:00.427 --> 52:05.833
He said, He didn't know how to be
something that he never had for himself.

52:09.937 --> 52:12.773
That mindset, man, that mindset.

52:14.942 --> 52:16.942
So, I made a decision
right then and there,

52:16.944 --> 52:19.713
I said I was going to release
that generational curse.

52:22.448 --> 52:23.884
I'm a dad, man.

52:24.818 --> 52:27.853
Four kids, man.
And it gives me every bit of joy

52:27.855 --> 52:31.058
to watch those little babies grow
up right before my eyes, man.

52:33.727 --> 52:34.928
I don't know you,

52:36.729 --> 52:38.631
but you going to have to
forgive your pops, yo.

52:39.699 --> 52:41.567
Cause some days
you gonna be a father.

52:44.871 --> 52:46.372
It starts with you, yo.

52:58.517 --> 53:00.551
People always
trying to school somebody, man.

53:00.553 --> 53:02.887
That was deep, though. You need
to start listening, man.

53:02.889 --> 53:04.955
I'm not listening to that dude.

53:04.957 --> 53:07.224
You know, I'll end up just
like my pops anyway, J.

53:07.226 --> 53:09.059
He sold drugs, now I sell drugs.

53:09.061 --> 53:11.996
Nothing like him, man.
He's a big-time drug dealer.

53:11.998 --> 53:13.866
All we do is sell a little weed.

53:16.534 --> 53:17.637
Right?

53:18.905 --> 53:22.072
No, moms ain't
working right now, man.

53:22.074 --> 53:24.641
I had to make some extra cash,
I mean, I got a little counter.

53:24.643 --> 53:28.478
Come on, Diggy, we said we wasn't going
to get trapped in that world, remember?

53:28.480 --> 53:31.848
- That's real-time, man.
- I know, man.

53:31.850 --> 53:33.119
Gave me your word, though.

53:34.253 --> 53:36.853
Bro, look it's only temporary

53:36.855 --> 53:39.023
until I get moms
back on her feet.

53:39.025 --> 53:42.594
Few more weeks, bro,
I'm done. I promise you, J.

53:46.998 --> 53:50.900
<i>Today, we have coverage on the
highly publicized trial of Aaron Davis.</i>

53:50.902 --> 53:54.704
<i>It was just announced that all murder
charges against Davis have been dropped.</i>

53:54.706 --> 53:57.240
- <i>As of right now, he is not a suspect.</i>
- <i>Thanks, Cindy.</i>

53:57.242 --> 54:01.244
<i>Aaron Davis, the former gang leader
indicted for the murder of sibling</i>

54:01.246 --> 54:05.014
<i>Shanna Garfield has been exonerated
after years of incarceration.</i>

54:05.016 --> 54:09.018
<i>A special appeal was filed by Manuel
Jackson within the state attorney's office</i>

54:09.020 --> 54:11.653
<i>and after key evidence
was re-examined by the judge,</i>

54:11.655 --> 54:14.257
<i>he immediately placed
a motion for Davis' release.</i>

54:14.259 --> 54:16.259
<i>The next question
authorities are asking is,</i>

54:16.261 --> 54:18.727
<i>"How did this happen,
and how much will Davis settle</i>

54:18.729 --> 54:21.465
<i>with the state for
the wrongful conviction?"</i>

54:24.035 --> 54:26.535
- Hey.
- Hey.

54:26.537 --> 54:28.073
Welcome home.

54:29.573 --> 54:32.476
Momma, I'm hungry.

54:33.744 --> 54:36.111
I've cooked all your favorites,
you know I did.

54:36.113 --> 54:38.882
Come on, baby. Grab it.

54:40.751 --> 54:43.220
Oh, sweetie.

54:48.158 --> 54:49.791
The food was awesome.

54:49.793 --> 54:51.827
And you know that
there's plenty more

54:51.829 --> 54:55.130
where that comes from.

54:55.132 --> 55:00.636
Oh, I have been
holding something for you.

55:14.084 --> 55:15.618
What am I
supposed to do with this?

55:17.287 --> 55:19.189
I'm sure you'll
think of something.

55:28.031 --> 55:29.732
- Keep that.
- M-hm.

55:40.743 --> 55:42.243
Thank you.

55:42.245 --> 55:43.746
You're welcome.

- No, man.

56:52.813 --> 56:56.382
Let me guess,
you ain't got my money, do you?

56:56.384 --> 56:58.151
- I was on my way to get it, man.
- You was going to get it?

56:58.153 --> 56:59.751
- Yeah.
- Then why you running?

56:59.753 --> 57:01.454
- I'm not, man.
- Don't lie to me.

57:01.456 --> 57:02.756
I'm not lying, man.

57:03.724 --> 57:05.160
- Not lying, huh?
- No.

57:06.361 --> 57:09.362
- Get on your knees, man.
- What?

57:09.364 --> 57:11.132
Get on your knees.

57:14.301 --> 57:15.970
Get on your knees!

57:17.439 --> 57:19.371
You ain't got to do this, man.

57:19.373 --> 57:23.010
Look, I'm going to ask you
one more time, boy.

57:24.278 --> 57:27.815
Where is my money?

57:29.250 --> 57:31.819
Alright, man. Alright.
Please, man.

57:35.089 --> 57:38.857
I don't got it, and my
mom stole it man, she's sick.

57:38.859 --> 57:42.760
I didn't know what else to do, man, but
I'll tell you, I'll work it off, man.

57:42.762 --> 57:44.829
I need a little more time, man.

57:44.831 --> 57:46.200
A little more time.

57:47.767 --> 57:49.103
I'll work it off.

57:50.870 --> 57:52.204
I'm gonna get it for you, bro.

57:52.206 --> 57:53.440
I promise, man.

57:54.508 --> 57:56.140
- What are you going to do, hu?
- Anything,

57:56.142 --> 57:58.410
anything you ask, man. I'll do.

57:58.412 --> 57:59.979
Anything.

58:02.449 --> 58:04.017
So this is what you're gonna do.

58:05.185 --> 58:08.853
Is this dude that's just
got off for serving a few years

58:08.855 --> 58:11.758
for killing my niece.

58:13.259 --> 58:15.328
I want you
to kill his son for us.

58:17.497 --> 58:19.132
Who's that?

58:20.400 --> 58:22.500
Aaron Davis.

58:22.502 --> 58:24.802
Got a son named J.

58:24.804 --> 58:27.805
What man? J? I mean, that's
my best friend, I can't...

58:27.807 --> 58:30.474
Look I don't care if
that's your friend!

58:30.476 --> 58:32.445
You either kill him
or you don't!

58:33.346 --> 58:34.780
Cause if you don't,

58:36.015 --> 58:38.451
that little
dope head mama of his...

58:40.220 --> 58:42.155
that little brother of yours,

58:46.292 --> 58:48.194
they're gonna
catch these bullets.

58:51.797 --> 58:53.265
Get my money

58:54.500 --> 58:56.301
and you better kill that boy.

58:57.269 --> 58:58.404
Let's go, Dread.

59:01.373 --> 59:02.908
I'm not playing with you, boy.

59:12.851 --> 59:14.019
I got it, ma'.

59:22.461 --> 59:24.096
Jalen.

59:28.333 --> 59:30.068
You're all grown up now,

59:31.169 --> 59:32.770
you're a man.

59:36.874 --> 59:38.943
How are you and your moms doing?

59:41.145 --> 59:44.449
We good, everybody's good.

59:46.350 --> 59:47.985
That's good to hear.

59:52.491 --> 59:53.891
You want to come in?

59:58.029 --> 59:59.261
Is it okay?

59:59.263 --> 01:00:00.798
Yeah, come on.

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:18.516
Just sit.

01:00:32.496 --> 01:00:34.498
Uh, Jalen,

01:00:35.599 --> 01:00:38.166
I heard you go down
to the community center a lot.

01:00:38.168 --> 01:00:41.838
And, uh, I don't know if you
know this, but I work there now.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:46.007
- That's what's up?
- It's not much,

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:50.113
but at least I can work my way
up from the bottom, you know.

01:00:51.181 --> 01:00:53.416
And hopefully
see you every now and then.

01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:58.154
Cool.

01:01:00.223 --> 01:01:01.391
You want something to drink?

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:05.395
No, I'm... I'm good.

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:10.465
Listen, Jalen
your mom's home and you're

01:01:10.467 --> 01:01:12.068
out here
playing in these streets.

01:01:14.371 --> 01:01:16.339
Yeah. What she say?

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:20.274
Alright, bro, you come from me.

01:01:20.276 --> 01:01:22.543
I don't want you to make
the same mistakes that I made

01:01:22.545 --> 01:01:24.614
and I definitely
made a lot of them.

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:28.683
We're from the same hood,
so we have tendencies of

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:31.586
wanting to make sure
that we hold everybody down.

01:01:31.588 --> 01:01:33.389
No, I've been cut that off.

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:41.696
That's good.

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:43.731
I'm proud of you, son.

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:46.001
It's one less thing
I have to worry about.

01:01:49.405 --> 01:01:51.204
Ma, are we good?

01:01:51.206 --> 01:01:53.039
What are you doing
in my house, Aaron?

01:01:53.041 --> 01:01:54.107
Ma, it's okay.

01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:55.477
No.

01:01:57.012 --> 01:01:59.246
Aaron.

01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:01.216
You have to
leave my house, Aaron.

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:09.324
Look, I... I'm not here to stay.

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:14.728
I really came here
to let you guys know

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:18.364
that I'm in a special program
down at the community center.

01:02:18.366 --> 01:02:23.169
And I was hoping you and Jalen
can come by before I graduate.

01:02:23.171 --> 01:02:26.274
It's called a
better father programming.

01:02:28.176 --> 01:02:29.510
Probably not.

01:02:34.215 --> 01:02:36.317
I'll just leave it here.

01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:51.165
But I'm not gonna give up.

01:02:56.437 --> 01:02:58.104
Wait, wait!

01:03:05.145 --> 01:03:07.314
Why did you do that, ma?

01:03:09.484 --> 01:03:12.217
Jalen, you're too young
to understand what's going on.

01:03:12.219 --> 01:03:14.185
You've been
saying that same line

01:03:14.187 --> 01:03:16.789
my entire life,
but he's still my father!

01:03:16.791 --> 01:03:20.592
Yeah, I can't
handle this right now.

01:03:20.594 --> 01:03:25.463
You can't handle what?
Why did you kick him out, ma?

01:03:25.465 --> 01:03:28.101
Answer me, ma?
Why did you do that?

01:03:29.769 --> 01:03:31.404
Who do you think
you're talking to?

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:35.275
Who do you think raised you?

01:03:37.477 --> 01:03:40.280
He's gonna walk through the door and
you're going to turn on me now?

01:03:49.489 --> 01:03:51.223
Jalen.

01:03:57.196 --> 01:04:00.765
That's no problem at all.
Oh, Mr. Davis,

01:04:00.767 --> 01:04:02.767
I was beginning to think
we weren't going to see you.

01:04:02.769 --> 01:04:04.736
- You lied to me!
- What's going on?

01:04:04.738 --> 01:04:06.571
Man, I did everything
you told me to do

01:04:06.573 --> 01:04:08.405
- and it blew up in my face.
- Alright. Wait, wait.

01:04:08.407 --> 01:04:10.107
Let's talk about it, alright?

01:04:10.109 --> 01:04:11.575
Everybody, sit down.

01:04:11.577 --> 01:04:12.779
Sit down, please!

01:04:14.213 --> 01:04:16.580
I made myself
available to my son.

01:04:16.582 --> 01:04:20.484
- Well, that's good, Aaron.
- But she did exactly what I thought she would do.

01:04:20.486 --> 01:04:22.419
Trying to act like I
don't deserve to see my son.

01:04:22.421 --> 01:04:28.225
- Wait a minute.
- You don't. You gotta earn that, bro.

01:04:28.227 --> 01:04:31.395
You probably lied to her,
probably lied to your boy.

01:04:31.397 --> 01:04:34.765
What do you know about earning, fool?
You know nothing about me

01:04:34.767 --> 01:04:38.268
and you don't know nothing
about my situation, partner!

01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:40.202
Matter of fact,
you know who I am, huh?

01:04:40.204 --> 01:04:42.806
Well, I just got out, but I
don't mind going back for you.

01:04:42.808 --> 01:04:45.409
Let's go. Come on, let's go!

01:04:45.411 --> 01:04:46.910
- Come on now.
- You ain't got to hold me, bro.

01:04:46.912 --> 01:04:49.413
- I ain't... I'm here.
- Sit down, please.

01:04:49.415 --> 01:04:51.483
- You're Lucky,
- Have a seat.

01:04:57.555 --> 01:05:03.392
Now, Aaron,
what happened to change, man?

01:05:03.394 --> 01:05:06.262
Man, you may not like
what this brother had to say,

01:05:06.264 --> 01:05:07.765
but he's telling the truth.

01:05:08.666 --> 01:05:12.936
Now change may be the hardest thing
you have to do in your life.

01:05:12.938 --> 01:05:16.274
Man, do you want a relationship
with Jalen or not?

01:05:18.276 --> 01:05:20.276
I do, man.

01:05:20.278 --> 01:05:21.479
I really do.

01:05:22.614 --> 01:05:25.648
No matter how many times
you've got to go back go back.

01:05:25.650 --> 01:05:27.585
Do whatever it takes
to see your son.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:32.588
But my problem is
my son don't respect me

01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:35.791
because I'm trying to be
honest and do what's right.

01:05:35.793 --> 01:05:37.562
What do I do about that?

01:05:38.563 --> 01:05:44.736
Well, all you could do is be
a father to your son. You know.

01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:48.971
Teach him to own, not to borrow.

01:05:48.973 --> 01:05:51.439
Teach him how to
respect his woman.

01:05:51.441 --> 01:05:56.411
Now you stay on that course and
you're gonna get the respect again

01:05:56.413 --> 01:05:57.849
and leave the rest to God.

01:05:58.983 --> 01:06:00.584
I can feel that.

01:06:02.619 --> 01:06:04.619
I'm sorry about earlier.

01:06:04.621 --> 01:06:06.554
Man, you know how we do
where we from, bro.

01:06:06.556 --> 01:06:09.724
We're good, bro.
You know, we all make mistakes.

01:06:09.726 --> 01:06:11.595
I guess that's why
we are all here, huh?

01:06:14.331 --> 01:06:15.766
You are a good dude, man.

01:06:16.667 --> 01:06:17.966
Thank you.

01:06:17.968 --> 01:06:19.703
Man, that ain't nothing but God.

01:06:21.271 --> 01:06:25.540
That reminds me if any of you would
like to attend church with me tonight,

01:06:25.542 --> 01:06:27.742
well, you're more than welcome.

01:06:27.744 --> 01:06:29.644
Count me in, man.

01:06:29.646 --> 01:06:32.246
I just hope God help me take
care of some of these bills

01:06:32.248 --> 01:06:34.216
cause I haven't
been hustling in a while.

01:06:35.384 --> 01:06:37.621
Let's hope the church
don't burn down first.

01:06:39.588 --> 01:06:42.358
Count me in too. I'll be there.

01:06:45.996 --> 01:06:49.498
Anytime the Devil
tells me I'm not something,

01:06:50.633 --> 01:06:52.668
I always say, I am that.

01:06:54.704 --> 01:06:57.573
Anytime the Devil
tells me I am something,

01:06:58.708 --> 01:07:00.976
I always say I'm not that.

01:07:02.011 --> 01:07:05.881
You can do all things through
Christ who strengthens you.

01:07:07.283 --> 01:07:09.251
You can make the choice today.

01:07:10.286 --> 01:07:13.754
I don't care how deep you are
in it, you are coming out of it.

01:07:13.756 --> 01:07:18.291
I declare in Jesus name, that
today is your day of freedom.

01:07:20.730 --> 01:07:22.965
I hope you know today
that you've been chosen by God.

01:07:25.668 --> 01:07:30.037
Chosen to make it. Chosen to
outlast it and outlive it.

01:07:30.039 --> 01:07:33.876
Lord Jesus,
His call is upon your life.

01:07:34.744 --> 01:07:36.442
You might have to
come out of the clique.

01:07:36.444 --> 01:07:37.845
You might have to
come out of the game.

01:07:37.847 --> 01:07:39.545
You might
have come out of the club.

01:07:39.547 --> 01:07:42.082
- Yes.
- Make no mistake about it.

01:07:42.084 --> 01:07:44.017
You are marked by God.

01:07:44.019 --> 01:07:45.318
You are a marked man.

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:46.954
You are a marked woman.

01:07:46.956 --> 01:07:49.889
Transitions are not fun
and they are not easy,

01:07:49.891 --> 01:07:53.025
but let me tell you
something about transition.

01:07:53.027 --> 01:07:55.595
Whenever God chooses you,

01:07:55.597 --> 01:07:57.897
He'll twist and
turn and He'll change this.

01:07:57.899 --> 01:08:01.501
He'll order your steps and have you
at the right place at the right time.

01:08:01.503 --> 01:08:03.870
Yes! Amen.

01:08:03.872 --> 01:08:05.305
Hey.

01:08:07.041 --> 01:08:08.342
Are you okay?

01:08:09.577 --> 01:08:10.678
What's wrong?

01:08:11.946 --> 01:08:13.347
Talk to me.

01:08:15.382 --> 01:08:18.551
Yo, where you've been, man?
I've been looking for you.

01:08:22.791 --> 01:08:24.656
Needed some alone time, man.

01:08:24.658 --> 01:08:27.059
Yo, what is wrong with you, J?

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:29.594
God has touched your life.

01:08:29.595 --> 01:08:32.531
He pulled you out of darkness
into His marvelous light.

01:08:32.533 --> 01:08:34.399
I don't know who
He's talking to today

01:08:34.401 --> 01:08:36.135
but I want you
to identify yourself

01:08:36.136 --> 01:08:39.437
by getting up out of your seat
and come down to this alter

01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:42.474
and tell God, "God,
I want you to change my life.

01:08:42.475 --> 01:08:45.609
You hold the keys to my
destiny." That's it, come on.

01:08:45.612 --> 01:08:48.779
I dare you to tell your feet,
"Get to the nearest aisle

01:08:48.782 --> 01:08:52.917
and take me to Jesus."
God is about to change you.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:55.554
I said God is
about to change you.

01:08:55.555 --> 01:08:58.523
He's about to take everything
that was working against you

01:08:58.524 --> 01:09:01.760
and work it together for you,
who are you today?

01:09:01.761 --> 01:09:04.395
I declare that
it changes forever.

01:09:04.397 --> 01:09:09.701
My life changes today. That's it, baby,
lift your hands and allow God to touch you.

01:09:09.703 --> 01:09:11.770
Let his spirit rest upon you.

01:09:11.772 --> 01:09:14.038
He has marked you for a purpose.

01:09:14.041 --> 01:09:16.006
Thank you, God for your purpose.

01:09:16.009 --> 01:09:19.044
It's the purpose of God
that shall prevail.

01:09:19.046 --> 01:09:22.813
I thank you God that nothing
that we've been through

01:09:22.814 --> 01:09:25.549
has the ability
to disqualify us.

01:09:25.551 --> 01:09:28.819
I thank you, God
that hell has never created

01:09:28.821 --> 01:09:32.689
a sin that the blood
could not wash away.

01:09:32.692 --> 01:09:34.524
Excuse me,
we're talking right now.

01:09:34.527 --> 01:09:36.060
Man, get your girl
out of my face.

01:09:36.062 --> 01:09:38.162
Look, you're overstepping
your boundaries, dawg.

01:09:38.163 --> 01:09:41.131
What, you are choosing
a female over me now, bro?

01:09:41.133 --> 01:09:42.401
What's up with you, dawg?

01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:47.372
Yo, man we got company.

01:09:48.573 --> 01:09:50.076
He wants me to smoke you, dawg?

01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:56.881
- Paris, You need to go to the church.
- Jalen, what is going on?

01:09:56.883 --> 01:09:58.182
- You need to go right now!
- I don't want to go!

01:09:58.184 --> 01:10:00.050
Go. Run!

01:10:00.052 --> 01:10:02.152
Praise you for His power.

01:10:02.154 --> 01:10:06.223
Praise Him because every yoke
is destroyed in your praise.

01:10:06.225 --> 01:10:09.026
You ought to let the Devil
hear you're praising God!

01:10:09.028 --> 01:10:11.694
Let drugs hear you praising God!

01:10:11.696 --> 01:10:14.797
Let failure hear
you praising God!

01:10:14.799 --> 01:10:22.106
We break the spirit of failure off of
your life today in the name of Jesus.

01:10:22.108 --> 01:10:23.973
Do it, Jesus.

01:10:23.975 --> 01:10:26.542
If you don't fix it,
it won't be fixed.

01:10:26.544 --> 01:10:29.213
I'm so sorry.

01:10:29.215 --> 01:10:32.548
I know that I've
put you through so much.

01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:36.955
You've been such a blessing
to me, please forgive me.

01:10:38.256 --> 01:10:40.592
I pray to God that
you forgive me, please.

01:10:46.998 --> 01:10:49.466
Go, man! Go!
Go, man, go!

01:10:50.969 --> 01:10:51.970
Go, go, go.

01:11:15.659 --> 01:11:18.896
Come on!
Come on, bro. Come on.

01:11:20.965 --> 01:11:22.733
Digg, this way. This way, Digg.

01:11:27.171 --> 01:11:28.472
What you doing, man?

01:11:30.708 --> 01:11:32.109
Are you serious right now, man?

01:11:33.877 --> 01:11:35.143
You crazy?

01:11:35.145 --> 01:11:37.012
I'm sorry, J.

01:11:37.014 --> 01:11:38.882
What's taking so long?

01:11:43.854 --> 01:11:47.688
Daddy, daddy. Jalen is in trouble,
we have to go, we have to go.

01:11:47.690 --> 01:11:49.657
Go and get Mr. Aaron.
We have to go.

01:11:49.659 --> 01:11:52.695
- We gotta go.
- Please, hurry.

01:11:55.865 --> 01:11:58.801
All you got to do is
cock it back...

01:12:00.204 --> 01:12:02.270
and pull the trigger.

01:12:02.272 --> 01:12:04.306
Mr. Aaron... Something is going
on with Jalen and Diggy,

01:12:04.308 --> 01:12:06.308
- they're in trouble. These guys...
- Where are they?

01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:07.975
- Where are they?
- They said they were going to kill Jalen,

01:12:07.977 --> 01:12:09.311
I don't know, they're outside.

01:12:09.313 --> 01:12:10.713
Go, go, I'll call the police.

01:12:13.317 --> 01:12:15.983
<i>911, emergency operator 929.</i>

01:12:15.985 --> 01:12:19.086
- Okay.
- This is my boy, man.

01:12:19.088 --> 01:12:20.123
Your boy?

01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:22.225
Your boy?

01:12:27.130 --> 01:12:28.729
Man, J didn't do it.

01:12:28.731 --> 01:12:31.234
He didn't do it?
Who did it then, Diggy?

01:12:38.107 --> 01:12:39.275
Just give me a sign.

01:12:40.943 --> 01:12:42.245
Anything!

01:12:43.179 --> 01:12:46.613
Please help me,
I don't know where he is.

01:12:59.395 --> 01:13:00.829
I'm waiting on you.

01:13:09.771 --> 01:13:11.104
You are ready to die, huh?

01:13:11.106 --> 01:13:13.206
Jalen!

01:13:13.208 --> 01:13:14.841
What's going on?

01:13:14.843 --> 01:13:16.409
He's going to kill my moms,

01:13:16.411 --> 01:13:18.113
and my little bro, man
if I don't do this.

01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:23.118
Look, I've hurt a lot of people
and I was wrong for it.

01:13:26.687 --> 01:13:28.190
Put the gun down.

01:13:29.057 --> 01:13:31.324
Don't ruin
the rest of your life, please.

01:13:31.326 --> 01:13:34.394
Please. Please.

01:13:34.396 --> 01:13:37.397
Look, I don't even know
what's going on

01:13:37.399 --> 01:13:40.066
but whatever it is,
we can fix it.

01:13:40.068 --> 01:13:43.936
If they owe you money, I can pay it.
Just don't hurt my son.

01:13:43.938 --> 01:13:45.340
He doesn't want the money, man.

01:13:47.074 --> 01:13:48.841
Got the money?

01:13:48.843 --> 01:13:50.212
I can find the money.

01:13:51.745 --> 01:13:54.847
You all hear this man.
He can find the money.

01:13:54.849 --> 01:13:58.018
We should be chasing
him all day then, right?

01:13:59.421 --> 01:14:00.654
This man.

01:14:01.423 --> 01:14:04.990
Hey, look.
Hey, this for my niece.

01:14:04.992 --> 01:14:06.026
Pops, no!

01:14:14.235 --> 01:14:16.034
The cops are here, man.

01:14:16.036 --> 01:14:18.137
Come on, man.
Let's roll out.

01:14:18.139 --> 01:14:19.039
Let's move.

01:14:23.377 --> 01:14:24.977
Diggy.

01:14:24.979 --> 01:14:28.447
Diggy, come on, man.

01:14:28.449 --> 01:14:30.815
Put your head up, put your
head up, come on, breathe.

01:14:30.817 --> 01:14:33.920
Breath. Alright, bro?
You good. You're good.

01:14:35.489 --> 01:14:39.924
- I'm scared, J.
- You good, man. Relax, alright? We need help!

01:14:39.926 --> 01:14:44.228
- I'm scared, J. I'm scared.
- Don't be scared, man, you good, alright?

01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:45.930
You're gonna get past this, man.

01:14:45.932 --> 01:14:48.101
- You good.
- Tell my brother I love him, man.

01:14:49.202 --> 01:14:51.302
- I love you, Dawg. Alright.
- I'm sorry.

01:14:51.304 --> 01:14:52.904
- I go to church, okay?
- I'm sorry.

01:14:52.906 --> 01:14:54.405
I'm going to church every day,

01:14:54.407 --> 01:14:56.974
I'm reading the Bible, man.
Okay? I mean...

01:14:56.976 --> 01:14:57.977
I love you, man.

01:14:59.145 --> 01:15:01.114
Come on we need help, right now!

01:15:02.215 --> 01:15:04.918
Stay with me, Diggy.
Stay with me. Stay with me!

01:15:20.066 --> 01:15:22.766
Come on, man. Come on, Diggy!

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:23.767
Diggy, wake up, man.

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:24.935
No.

01:15:24.937 --> 01:15:27.003
Diggy, wake up, man!

01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:50.227
<i>Pursuit,
Los Angeles. Suspect is a male.</i>

01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:51.830
<i>Unknown, wearing a red shirt.</i>

01:15:53.365 --> 01:15:56.101
Excuse me, ma'am
is your son Demetrius Smith?

01:16:05.244 --> 01:16:06.378
Mom...

01:16:07.878 --> 01:16:09.214
Where is Diggy?

01:16:11.183 --> 01:16:12.251
Baby.

01:16:16.355 --> 01:16:19.556
Ma, it's killing you.

01:16:19.558 --> 01:16:20.992
It's killing us.

01:16:24.228 --> 01:16:25.930
Ma, I can get you some help.

01:16:29.568 --> 01:16:31.202
Calvin and I still need you, ma.

01:16:34.573 --> 01:16:36.374
I just miss
the way things used to be.

01:17:05.336 --> 01:17:06.936
God...

01:17:09.307 --> 01:17:11.375
I miss my friend Diggy.

01:17:12.510 --> 01:17:14.478
I just hope he's okay.

01:17:17.247 --> 01:17:19.047
I just want to
thank you for bringing my pops

01:17:19.049 --> 01:17:20.817
back into my life...

01:17:24.154 --> 01:17:26.056
and for my girlfriend.

01:17:26.923 --> 01:17:29.225
I think she's
my girlfriend, yeah.

01:17:32.195 --> 01:17:34.495
I ask that you continue
to make me a better man.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:37.899
Amen.

01:17:54.284 --> 01:17:58.152
I think that's when I found God
for the first time.

01:17:58.154 --> 01:18:02.189
- That's an amazing story.
- I feel the same way, bro.

01:18:02.191 --> 01:18:04.057
Hey, you missed a spot.

01:18:04.059 --> 01:18:05.660
Get the hell out, man.
Is this you?

01:18:05.662 --> 01:18:07.961
I was just
about to tell you, kiss my ass.

01:18:07.963 --> 01:18:10.366
Yes, how's everything
going with your new positions?

01:18:11.668 --> 01:18:14.034
I ain't gonna lie, man.
It's different.

01:18:14.036 --> 01:18:16.537
Earning a honest
living is hard work.

01:18:16.539 --> 01:18:18.673
Yeah, this is
for the birds, man.

01:18:18.675 --> 01:18:23.711
But, it gives us time to think.
As a matter of fact,

01:18:23.713 --> 01:18:28.315
me and J got an idea. We're gonna
open up our own janitorial service.

01:18:28.317 --> 01:18:30.183
- Getting other people to work for us.
- Right.

01:18:30.185 --> 01:18:32.486
- We rent.
- See, that's what I'm talking about.

01:18:32.488 --> 01:18:34.321
That's how you do it.
When you have your own

01:18:34.323 --> 01:18:36.990
you don't have to answer
to nobody but God.

01:18:36.992 --> 01:18:38.558
My grandfather taught me that.

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.427
Except that he forgot
to leave out the part

01:18:40.429 --> 01:18:42.964
where you have to
answer to your wife, you know.

01:18:44.031 --> 01:18:46.400
So, you're ready for later?

01:18:46.402 --> 01:18:49.969
I have a feeling that your life's
about to change for the better.

01:18:49.971 --> 01:18:51.371
I don't know, man.

01:18:51.373 --> 01:18:53.072
About as ready
as I ever be, I guess.

01:18:53.074 --> 01:18:55.477
Oh, man, you going to
be just fine, my brother.

01:18:56.745 --> 01:19:00.148
You're an amazing man
and I mean that.

01:19:01.115 --> 01:19:04.250
Thank you. Me and J
we'll collect this dollars,

01:19:04.252 --> 01:19:06.553
open up this business
and get this money.

01:19:06.555 --> 01:19:08.555
Legit paper.

01:19:08.557 --> 01:19:12.024
- Save me some.
- We might let you work for us.

01:19:12.026 --> 01:19:13.192
Ain't going to happen.

01:19:13.194 --> 01:19:14.128
Ain't going to happen.

01:19:18.199 --> 01:19:19.634
How are you?

01:19:21.569 --> 01:19:22.970
I'm okay,

01:19:24.405 --> 01:19:26.307
I miss Diggy a lot, though.

01:19:27.241 --> 01:19:30.443
It feels weird not
being able to see him every day.

01:19:30.445 --> 01:19:33.581
Yeah. I'm so sorry
about Diggy, Jalen.

01:19:36.317 --> 01:19:38.217
How are things with your dad?

01:19:38.219 --> 01:19:40.686
Me and Pops, we're good.

01:19:40.688 --> 01:19:43.324
Yeah, that's good.

01:19:44.325 --> 01:19:48.494
So, you're gonna
come to his graduation?

01:19:48.496 --> 01:19:50.763
It's today.

01:19:50.765 --> 01:19:53.200
Yeah, I was planning on it.

01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:58.573
What's wrong?

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:03.676
This last session
can get really crazy.

01:20:03.678 --> 01:20:06.177
A lot of old feelings
can resurface

01:20:06.179 --> 01:20:11.115
and... I just want to
make sure you can handle it all.

01:20:19.226 --> 01:20:20.425
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:20:20.427 --> 01:20:21.695
Hi.

01:20:24.097 --> 01:20:25.499
Hi, Aaron.

01:20:29.269 --> 01:20:31.302
- Pops.
- Hey, son.

01:20:31.304 --> 01:20:33.538
Hey, Jalen. How's it going?

01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:35.040
Good, Mr. Monty.

01:20:38.678 --> 01:20:41.046
That's good to hear, son.
That's good to hear.

01:20:44.383 --> 01:20:46.686
So, you guys ready
for the meeting?

01:20:47.754 --> 01:20:49.221
Okay.

01:20:54.627 --> 01:20:57.327
So, uh...

01:20:57.329 --> 01:21:00.163
Listen. First, I'd like to say,

01:21:00.165 --> 01:21:03.333
it's been a pleasure
meeting all of you.

01:21:03.335 --> 01:21:07.170
This is the first time
that all participants

01:21:07.172 --> 01:21:09.506
- have been reunited with their children.
- Wow.

01:21:09.508 --> 01:21:13.443
And that does...
That doesn't usually happen.

01:21:13.445 --> 01:21:16.847
And you had a lot
to do with that, man.

01:21:16.849 --> 01:21:22.184
Aaron, you have grown so much as
an individual and as a father.

01:21:22.186 --> 01:21:25.624
He, uh... He really wants
this thing to work.

01:21:26.525 --> 01:21:29.127
And by thing
I mean the three of you.

01:21:31.797 --> 01:21:34.598
Jalen, we're
going to start with you.

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:36.635
Is there anything you
want to say to your pops?

01:21:39.572 --> 01:21:42.471
They say it's not how you start
but how you finish, right?

01:21:42.473 --> 01:21:44.373
Yeah.

01:21:44.375 --> 01:21:46.475
So I just want my pops
to know I'm proud of him.

01:21:46.477 --> 01:21:49.514
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't tell me. Tell him.

01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:54.383
I just want you to know
I'm proud of you, Pops.

01:21:54.385 --> 01:21:57.755
And I'm happy to have you back
in my life, and I love you.

01:21:58.656 --> 01:22:00.189
I love you too.

01:22:00.191 --> 01:22:01.757
Are we good?

01:22:01.759 --> 01:22:03.326
We're great. We're Gucci.

01:22:06.264 --> 01:22:10.165
Shala, what do
you want from Aaron?

01:22:10.167 --> 01:22:11.736
Well, uhm.

01:22:13.571 --> 01:22:17.542
Well I... I forgave Aaron
at the altar, but...

01:22:19.877 --> 01:22:21.546
I just want to say...

01:22:23.481 --> 01:22:27.451
I mean, maybe... Maybe there's
not going to be an us.

01:22:29.621 --> 01:22:31.121
I just want to say...

01:22:32.356 --> 01:22:35.590
like if there is
the slightest chance

01:22:35.592 --> 01:22:38.326
that you are not
going to be there

01:22:38.328 --> 01:22:41.262
as a father in Jalen's life

01:22:41.264 --> 01:22:44.601
then please,
please just end it now.

01:22:48.905 --> 01:22:50.907
I know it was hard on you

01:22:52.275 --> 01:22:54.544
and you held it down
when I was locked up,

01:22:55.812 --> 01:22:58.246
but I need you and Jalen both.

01:22:58.248 --> 01:23:00.149
I just want to make this right.

01:23:11.895 --> 01:23:15.766
I know that this
didn't work the first time.

01:23:18.869 --> 01:23:20.369
But, Shala...

01:23:21.537 --> 01:23:24.405
I love you with all of my heart

01:23:24.407 --> 01:23:28.177
and I'd love you
to marry me again.

01:23:31.982 --> 01:23:34.648
Please?

01:23:46.762 --> 01:23:47.897
Yeah, I know.

01:24:00.375 --> 01:24:03.813
Hey, Calvin, I'm your father.

01:24:09.652 --> 01:24:13.254
- You want to help?
- Are you going to help? Will you get out of here?

01:24:14.456 --> 01:24:16.023
You're in trouble.

01:24:16.025 --> 01:24:18.624
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Put that ball down.

01:24:18.626 --> 01:24:21.931
- What is wrong with you?
- Go and get that ball.

01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:26.634
Like a party to me.

01:24:29.437 --> 01:24:31.539
What's up, girl?
How are you doing, baby?

01:24:41.549 --> 01:24:43.583
- Hey.
- Getting the ball in the house.

01:24:43.585 --> 01:24:44.619
What's wrong with you all.

01:24:45.787 --> 01:24:47.053
Crazy. All crazy.

01:24:47.055 --> 01:24:49.989
- Let's go all...
- Let's eat!

01:24:49.991 --> 01:24:52.592
I had to preach and teach to y'all
and tell you all what to do.

01:24:52.594 --> 01:24:55.561
Y'all grown men. Well, what
I'll really say is, you know,

01:24:55.563 --> 01:24:58.430
it's time to go home
and do the right thing.

01:24:58.432 --> 01:25:00.300
Cause none of us really
want to be in here,

01:25:01.870 --> 01:25:06.273
you know what I mean? I mean y'all talk
every day about what we need to do.

01:25:07.508 --> 01:25:11.077
First of all, I'd like to say that it
feels so good to see all of us together.

01:25:11.079 --> 01:25:12.947
- Yes, indeed.
- Bow your heads.

01:25:13.948 --> 01:25:16.949
Lord, we humbly come to you once
again asking for forgiveness

01:25:16.951 --> 01:25:19.818
and thanking you for this
wonderful, wonderful food.

01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:21.920
- Yes, Lord.
- In Jesus name.

01:25:21.922 --> 01:25:23.622
- Amen.
- Amen!

01:25:23.624 --> 01:25:25.592
I didn't want to be too long.
I'm hungry.

01:25:29.532 --> 01:25:34.532
