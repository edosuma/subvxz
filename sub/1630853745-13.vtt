WEBVTT

00:04.295 --> 00:05.797
Kick it on, nice.

00:07.507 --> 00:08.717
Courtney’s like a
little captain out there.

00:08.758 --> 00:10.135
I know.

00:10.176 --> 00:11.886
I’ve got eyes on Courtney
to be my lead.

00:11.928 --> 00:14.347
Problem is,
Mzi’s a personal friend of mine.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.349
He’s gonna be so
----ing bummed.

00:16.391 --> 00:17.726
Thank you so much for today,
you’re a rock star.

00:17.767 --> 00:19.477
Do you wanna learn
something new about me?

00:19.519 --> 00:20.979
I can squeak my eyeballs.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.022
[squeaking]

00:22.063 --> 00:23.356
Ah!

00:23.398 --> 00:24.649
I’m really enjoying
this charter.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.443
There’s a good vibe,
which is nice.

00:26.484 --> 00:28.111
I’m just gonna make a sorbet.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.904
You are an exceptional
human being.

00:29.946 --> 00:32.240
Oh, my God [bleep] me.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.908
There’s not one thing
pulled for breakfast,

00:33.950 --> 00:35.368
pantry’s a mess, and
I’m just getting overwhelmed.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.037
That’s not okay.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.329
Yeah, I’m a snitch.

00:38.371 --> 00:39.873
That needs to be managed better.

00:39.914 --> 00:41.124
Either the boat’s gotta be clean

00:41.166 --> 00:42.542
or breakfast has got
to be pulled.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.169
It can’t be the boat’s
a sh---show

00:44.210 --> 00:45.962
from the bridge deck down
and nothing’s pulled at all.

00:46.004 --> 00:48.923
Tash and I are staying, because
she has to clear the pantry.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.550
It’s a bit rubbish.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.218
It’s a crew night out,
it’s Mzi’s birthday,

00:52.260 --> 00:53.470
and you’re telling
Kyle so he can’t go.

00:53.511 --> 00:54.512
I know chief stew, but, like...

00:54.554 --> 00:55.847
-No...
-that’s a bit...

00:55.889 --> 00:56.806
I just can’t win.

00:57.974 --> 00:59.726
-Jason!
-Jason!

00:59.768 --> 01:00.894
[whistles]

01:00.935 --> 01:02.395
Just flat-out ignoring me.

01:02.437 --> 01:03.855
This is not polished,
this is not polished.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.398
None of it’s polished,
I didn’t get to it.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.566
-Where’s your radio?
-It’s on me.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.318
I’ve called you three times.

01:10.695 --> 01:12.155
That’s why I’m having
a conversation with him.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.865
I just wanted to
have a quick chat

01:13.907 --> 01:15.408
so we could be on
the same page, dude.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.744
You get into, like,
this mood, and it...

01:17.786 --> 01:19.162
we can all feel it.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.872
I feel like I’m carrying
more than my load.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.749
I feel like it’s
the other way around.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.376
I don’t wanna leave anyone
high and dry, but replace me.

01:24.417 --> 01:25.919
No, that’s...

01:25.960 --> 01:27.796
I’m telling you right now,
bring someone else in.

01:27.837 --> 01:29.339
You don’t wanna be here if
you’re saying things like that.

01:29.381 --> 01:30.715
That’s literally
what I’m saying.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.217
I’m trying to change
my personality...

01:32.258 --> 01:33.301
No, I’m not here
to make you a victim.

01:33.343 --> 01:34.761
It’s already been brought up.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.221
I want you to stay, mate.

01:41.142 --> 01:43.645
I’ve censored myself
80 to 90 percent,

01:43.687 --> 01:45.522
the way I act and talk.

01:45.563 --> 01:46.940
Sometimes it just doesn’t click.

01:46.981 --> 01:48.650
-All right.
-And it’s just not clicking.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.076
I didn’t plan on ever
quitting or whatever,

01:58.118 --> 02:00.453
but it’s like [bleep] man,
what do you want me to do?

02:00.495 --> 02:03.790
If I’m that much of
a ----ing cancer

02:03.832 --> 02:06.459
to a situation ----ing
end it for me.

02:06.501 --> 02:10.505
I feel closer to the fish in
the water than the deck crew.

02:18.763 --> 02:20.473
I think I wanna do
a little pop-up,

02:20.515 --> 02:21.808
pop-up restaurant in the States.

02:21.850 --> 02:24.394
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah, you do the cocktails.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.521
-I do the coffee.
-And the coffee.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.898
I’m paying a bartender
to do cocktails.

02:28.940 --> 02:32.277
-Do you want a ginger shot?
-Um, sure.

02:32.318 --> 02:36.322
I’ve got a bad back today.
Bad back is real.

02:36.364 --> 02:38.283
Whoop!
What is it?

02:38.324 --> 02:41.244
-Is it just ginger?
-Ginger.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.912
Oh, that’s tangy.

02:42.954 --> 02:47.167
Since the age of 15, I’ve
always been in a relationship.

02:47.208 --> 02:50.170
I’ve never known what
it’s been like to be single.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.672
I’m kind of horrified
to be alone.

02:52.714 --> 02:56.593
There’s a lot of issues going
on with me and my boyfriend.

02:56.634 --> 02:59.179
I feel like Dave
is a good escape.

02:59.220 --> 03:03.683
I trust myself 110 percent
not to go down that road again,

03:03.725 --> 03:07.771
but I really crave someone
to be there for me.

03:07.812 --> 03:08.980
That is pure.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.858
That is ----ing hectic.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.028
-Cap?
-Hey.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.279
-How are you?
-Good.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.822
-Do you have a second?
-Of course.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.200
I wanted to chat to you
about an issue

03:20.241 --> 03:22.786
that I’ve tried to address.

03:22.827 --> 03:25.914
There’s been a lot going on
behind the scenes with Jason,

03:25.955 --> 03:27.874
in terms of his
attitude towards our team.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.543
Took him up to the sundeck
to have a chat with him,

03:30.585 --> 03:32.796
and just to basically
say listen, I’m here for you,

03:32.837 --> 03:34.964
I’m here to support you, and
he’s basically just said to me,

03:35.006 --> 03:37.509
well, he’s not gonna change,
and he wants to go.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.427
So, I said to him,
"Well, I don’t want you to go,

03:39.469 --> 03:40.804
this is why I’m having
a conversation with you."

03:40.845 --> 03:43.181
Okay, so he said
he wants to quit.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.641
All right, so, I need details.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.935
All right, so I’m like,
to be honest with you,

03:46.976 --> 03:48.311
it’s frustrating me
if he walks around

03:48.353 --> 03:49.896
and he doesn’t speak to us.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.773
He’s very grumpy, he ignores me,
he ignores Courtney.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.400
It’s, like,
it’s very difficult.

03:53.441 --> 03:54.818
I said to him, "I don’t
wanna make you a victim

03:54.859 --> 03:57.612
or feel like
I’m ostracizing you."

03:57.654 --> 04:01.324
I’m here to say, like,
when you’re in a good vibe,

04:01.366 --> 04:03.076
I really appreciate you.

04:03.118 --> 04:04.369
But the last three charters,
you haven’t been.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.620
Yeah.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.247
And it’s really
affecting everyone.

04:07.288 --> 04:09.040
He’s just, like, he
doesn’t jive with the team.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.251
Okay, that’s all I need.
Thank you very much.

04:11.292 --> 04:13.586
And I didn’t want you to feel
like I was pushing him away,

04:13.628 --> 04:14.921
because I value him on my team,

04:14.963 --> 04:16.673
and he’s got
the bow locked down.

04:16.715 --> 04:18.258
You know, it’s more
work now for everyone.

04:18.299 --> 04:20.051
Let me share this...

04:20.093 --> 04:22.345
when people say they don’t wanna
be here, I don’t want them here.

04:22.387 --> 04:23.430
But until I find someone else...

04:23.471 --> 04:24.931
That’s okay.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.766
I may need to have him
for the next charter, right?

04:26.808 --> 04:27.642
Got you.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.060
But we’ll get through this,

04:29.102 --> 04:31.771
and just try to diffuse
the situation, hopefully.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.356
-Of course.
-All right, awesome.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.734
-All right, thanks, Cap.
-All right, thank you.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.867
Jason, Jason,
come to the bridge.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.368
<i>Copy.</i>

04:46.995 --> 04:49.414
How’d you go with
everything, Storm?

04:49.456 --> 04:51.124
How was your chat?

04:51.166 --> 04:52.500
He doesn’t wanna be here,

04:52.542 --> 04:53.793
so we’re just looking
for someone else,

04:53.835 --> 04:55.086
but until then,
he’ll stay with us.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.421
So, we’ll see.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.381
Oh, hello, there.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.800
Storm just brought
me up to speed.

05:00.842 --> 05:04.012
Clearly, you said you
wanna leave.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.473
When my personality got
kinda brought into play,

05:06.514 --> 05:08.600
and I was already
biting my tongue a lot,

05:08.641 --> 05:09.768
-I don’t wanna just...
-Yeah.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.144
...throw a temper tantrum.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.687
I’m just trying not
to make anyone mad.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.898
Sometimes, people
just don’t gel.

05:14.939 --> 05:17.108
You know, when you
have personality conflicts,

05:17.150 --> 05:20.445
it’s not that your personality
is wrong or his is wrong,

05:20.487 --> 05:22.697
it’s just a conflict.

05:22.739 --> 05:25.492
And sometimes, it happens,

05:25.533 --> 05:26.868
even when you’re
excellent at your job.

05:26.910 --> 05:28.787
But we need that rhythm,
right,

05:28.828 --> 05:30.413
because the guests
pick up on it.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.332
You’ve always been
respectful to me,

05:32.374 --> 05:37.504
so I’m gonna ask you
to just continue to do your job

05:37.545 --> 05:39.130
until I find a replacement.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.509
I’m, like, running at
low capacity, but I’ll...

05:42.550 --> 05:43.551
-I’m not trying to leave...
-Yeah.

05:43.593 --> 05:44.844
-...anyone high and dry.

05:44.886 --> 05:45.929
I appreciate that.
Thank you so much.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.806
-Thanks, Cap.
-All right.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.850
Asking him to stay for the
next charter, that’s a risk.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.519
You know, like, I don’t know
how he’s gonna behave.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.145
But the charter starts
within a hour.

05:54.187 --> 05:57.107
We gotta focus on the job,
find a way to navigate this.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.234
You have to problem-solve.

05:59.275 --> 06:00.402
Is he?

06:09.119 --> 06:10.829
David, Natasha, and Storm,

06:10.870 --> 06:12.831
meet me in the crew mess
for preference sheet meeting.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.124
Copy that, Cap.

06:16.918 --> 06:17.961
Hello.

06:19.671 --> 06:21.047
Okay, charter number six.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.841
This is going to be
a shorter charter.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.551
-Wow.
-Oh, really?

06:24.592 --> 06:27.220
Myiesha Griffin is an
IT project manager.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.680
She is thrilled to
be vacationing

06:28.722 --> 06:30.598
with all of her
successful girlfriends.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.225
The group is ready to let
loose and plan

06:32.267 --> 06:35.020
to be three sheets to the wind
by the end of this charter.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.813
They’ve still got some
dietary requirements.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.691
They’ve got a vegan,
with no pork, poultry, turkey,

06:39.733 --> 06:41.359
red meat, animal dairy products,

06:41.401 --> 06:43.403
and the guests would like a
surf-and-turf style dinner.

06:43.445 --> 06:44.779
The primary doesn’t like fish,

06:44.821 --> 06:48.199
but she’s asked
for a surf-and-turf.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.534
Oh, God.

06:49.576 --> 06:50.869
A lot of dietary requirements,

06:50.910 --> 06:52.287
and no idea what
they’re talking about.

06:52.328 --> 06:54.622
Plus they’re gonna be on
for a shorter charter,

06:54.664 --> 06:56.750
which is even harder,
because if I [bleep] up

06:56.791 --> 06:58.293
then there’s no second chance.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.754
We’ve got jet-skiing again,
stand-up paddleboarding.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.589
The guests have
requested a local artist

07:02.630 --> 07:03.590
to come on board and perform.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.216
So, here’s the cool part...

07:05.258 --> 07:07.677
the owner has a connection to
a famous Maltese pop star,

07:07.719 --> 07:09.262
the artist Destiny.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.513
That would be cool.

07:10.555 --> 07:13.099
-To surprise the guests.
-Should be fun.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.434
-So, that’d be awesome, right?
-Yeah.

07:14.476 --> 07:15.852
Thanks, Sandy.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.065
Oh.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.985
Have you got
a lunch menu for today?

07:26.404 --> 07:28.239
Come sit on mummy’s lap.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.909
Roasted rack of lamb with
mint and caper salsa.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.410
-Broccoli and kale.
-Okay.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.704
It’s been an interesting day.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.289
Like, what are you thinking?

07:36.331 --> 07:37.457
Like, because yesterday
you were, obviously like,

07:37.499 --> 07:38.958
upset with what I said.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.211
I’m not saying
I don’t want this at all.

07:41.252 --> 07:43.088
I want this, I just wanna,
like, realize that

07:43.129 --> 07:45.006
we need to take it slower,
a little bit.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.633
Like, I just broke
up with my boyfriend

07:46.675 --> 07:47.967
about a month, or
two months ago.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.469
-Yeah.
-Like, it’s still very fresh.

07:49.511 --> 07:50.512
Yeah.

07:50.553 --> 07:51.638
You get?

07:51.680 --> 07:55.183
We’ll be on the same page.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.310
Anyway, but thanks,
appreciate the chat, and...

07:57.352 --> 07:58.895
-well, whatever.
-Yeah.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.855
It’s not the first time
I’ve been told to slow down.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.152
But right now, there’s so
much happening with my team,

08:06.194 --> 08:08.321
I feel like I need
to compartmentalize.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.448
I’m not too sure
what Jason’s deal is.

08:10.490 --> 08:14.494
If this goes sideways,
everything is gonna go to sh--.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.705
So, we need my main focus.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.290
All right, let’s go finish up.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.667
Oh!

08:20.709 --> 08:22.669
All crew, all crew,
get into your whites.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.838
We have 30 minutes
to meet on the dock.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.548
-Have fun.
-Yeah.

08:35.473 --> 08:36.599
Looks good, dude.

08:38.893 --> 08:41.896
Okay, it’s five to,
let’s run.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.693
Ready, girls?

08:46.735 --> 08:47.986
We are here, honey.

08:48.028 --> 08:51.531
I can just tell there’s
gonna be energy.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.199
Coming up...

09:00.040 --> 09:01.458
I can’t take you anymore.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.626
----ing hell, just get
the [bleep] outta my life.

09:13.011 --> 09:13.595
-Hi, ladies!
-Hello!

09:14.596 --> 09:15.638
-Hi!
-Welcome!

09:15.680 --> 09:17.349
You look fabulous!

09:17.390 --> 09:18.391
Thank you, I’m Mye.

09:18.433 --> 09:19.434
Hi, nice to meet you.

09:19.476 --> 09:20.810
I’m Dave, nice to meet you.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.020
So glad to have you.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.146
Hello, Natasha,
lovely to meet you.

09:23.188 --> 09:24.647
I’m Kyle, nice to meet you.

09:24.689 --> 09:25.857
Talia, nice to meet you.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.400
I love your man bun,
thank you.

09:27.442 --> 09:28.818
Okay.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.029
Welcome, ladies, to
your Home away from home.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.364
Thank you!

09:32.405 --> 09:35.158
Our chief stew, Natasha,
is gonna show you around.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.117
Yes.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.744
We’re gonna get your luggage on,

09:37.786 --> 09:38.995
and we’re gonna take
off for your vacation.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.288
-All right!
-Let’s go!

09:40.330 --> 09:41.498
There you go.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.749
-Cold towel?
-Yes.

09:42.791 --> 09:43.792
-Here we go.
-Thank you.

09:43.833 --> 09:44.834
You’re welcome.

09:44.876 --> 09:46.336
So, we can start the tour.

09:46.378 --> 09:47.462
Ooh!

09:47.504 --> 09:49.297
-If you follow this way.
-Okay.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.341
Ooh, ooh, don’t put the Gucci
on the ground, boy!

09:53.009 --> 09:55.637
So, this is a nice little
spot for a good dance,

09:55.679 --> 09:57.639
to blast some music.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.474
-Can you dance?
-Yes.

09:59.516 --> 10:00.517
Let me see it, go!

10:00.558 --> 10:01.559
So, you gonna dance with us?

10:01.601 --> 10:06.398
Go, go, go!

10:06.439 --> 10:08.441
Woo!

10:11.569 --> 10:13.321
Here’s the lunch menu.

10:13.363 --> 10:18.201
Roasted rack of lamb,
oh, I feel feverish!

10:20.120 --> 10:23.665
I definitely don’t want just
salads the whole time, though.

10:23.707 --> 10:27.127
Oh, these are a vibe, I like.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.045
Here is the master suite.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.839
There’s a nice,
big bathroom here.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.008
And don’t forget
about the Japanese bidet.

10:33.049 --> 10:36.928
Sitting there and getting
the fan on my ass...

10:40.640 --> 10:43.727
<i>Deck crew, deck crew,</i>
<i>all lines free, all lines free.</i>

10:45.311 --> 10:47.564
I so wanna sage
the outside of the boat,

10:47.605 --> 10:49.107
but the inside has great energy.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.775
-The lines are fine.
-Thank you.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.319
Stormo, Jason.
Both bow lines in.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.696
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

10:54.738 --> 10:57.032
<i>Your lines are on board.</i>

10:59.242 --> 11:01.244
Your stern is clear from
V3 and V4

11:01.286 --> 11:02.996
You are clear to swing.
Captain, you are clear to swing.

11:03.038 --> 11:04.873
Good job, everyone.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.917
I’m just getting the cutlery,
and then that’s the table set.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.215
Hey, well done on the bow, J.
Thanks, Courts.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.842
No, of course,
it’s what we’re here for.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.927
Y’all ready?

11:32.609 --> 11:33.693
You’re a beautiful being.

11:33.735 --> 11:34.778
Thank you.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.446
So, so beautiful.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.578
-Seven?
-Yeah.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.247
So, I think I should be the
eighth guest of any sitting.

11:46.289 --> 11:47.957
You already act like
the eighth guest,

11:47.999 --> 11:49.376
so you may as
well continue that.

11:54.756 --> 11:55.924
Where are all you ladies from?

11:57.926 --> 11:59.636
Have you all been
friends for a while?

11:59.678 --> 12:02.013
Friends from college
and high school.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.434
Who’s texting?

12:06.476 --> 12:07.811
Nobody.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.939
Anchor down!

12:10.980 --> 12:12.982
Copy that, Captain.

12:16.778 --> 12:17.862
Two in the water.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.114
Which way is the chain laying?

12:19.155 --> 12:21.908
Chain is 12:00,
short.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.451
Okay, I’m gonna lock it in.

12:23.493 --> 12:24.661
Thank you, Courts.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.121
What is this area,
what is this?

12:26.162 --> 12:27.205
-This is called the pantry.
-Is this the galley?

12:27.247 --> 12:28.415
This is where we operate.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.416
-Hi!
-Hey, girl.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.583
Let me see, we got...

12:30.625 --> 12:31.584
Honestly, it’s hella busy.

12:31.626 --> 12:32.585
-How you doing?
-Hello.

12:32.627 --> 12:33.878
Good, I see those lamb.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.255
That’s one of
my favorite things.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.089
Yes!

12:36.131 --> 12:37.507
The pressure’s on.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.928
Instead of having that one,
direct path I had,

12:41.970 --> 12:44.639
which was Tash, Tash, Tash.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.141
The last charter
we did was epic,

12:46.182 --> 12:47.767
and I just wanna keep it going.

12:47.809 --> 12:50.353
For these guests, preferences
weren’t the clearest.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.897
There’s a few meat-eaters,
and then there’s a vegan.

12:52.939 --> 12:56.109
It’s not ideal, but I’m gonna
try and give them variety.

12:56.151 --> 12:58.486
Oh, we have Havana Club.

12:58.528 --> 13:00.572
That’s good, I thought we
could only get that in Cuba.

13:00.613 --> 13:01.823
Oh, is that one of your faves?

13:01.865 --> 13:03.158
Should I make, like,
a big pitcher

13:03.199 --> 13:04.951
or, like, strawberry mojito
or something?

13:04.993 --> 13:06.745
Yeah, cool, I’m with it.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.581
Dave, what’s your
time on lunch?

13:09.622 --> 13:11.041
I can be ready when you are.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.171
All right, guys,
I’m going to cabins.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.380
Come on, thigh meat!

13:17.422 --> 13:21.009
We like thigh meat,
yes, girl!

13:21.051 --> 13:23.011
Give what needs to be given!

13:26.431 --> 13:27.974
Ooh, what’s that,
that looks good!

13:28.016 --> 13:30.268
Is that the strawberry...

13:30.310 --> 13:32.354
This is strawberry mojito, yeah.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.647
-I ain’t mad.
-I’m not mad at all.

13:34.689 --> 13:35.690
Not mad.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.067
-Two more fenders?
-Yeah.

13:37.108 --> 13:38.318
Then we can start
putting the toys out.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.652
Okay.

13:39.694 --> 13:41.905
Obviously, Jason leaving
and someone new coming in,

13:41.946 --> 13:43.323
there’s a lot going on.

13:43.365 --> 13:44.991
A lot of moving
parts right now.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.202
Let’s go,
we’ll wake your asses up.

13:47.243 --> 13:50.372
I know I need
to name a lead deckhand.

13:50.413 --> 13:53.625
It’s gonna be important for the
team’s dynamic, for everything.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.549
Will definitely not
let that happen again.

14:01.591 --> 14:04.052
Ooh, my goodness, you’re
like turbo Jason today.

14:04.094 --> 14:07.639
So, here we have
Moroccan-style couscous.

14:07.681 --> 14:12.018
There’s a vibrator, and
I don’t know what to do.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.561
-Hi, ladies.
-Hey.

14:13.603 --> 14:14.646
-Hello.
-Hi!

14:14.688 --> 14:15.814
-How you doing?
-Hello, there!

14:15.855 --> 14:17.607
So, the kale and broccoli salad,

14:17.649 --> 14:20.068
I’ve actually smoked the
broccoli with some lemon.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.028
Then with the lamb,
I’ve sous vided it,

14:22.070 --> 14:23.613
and I’ve made a
little paprika dusting.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.281
This looks amazing,
thank you so much.

14:25.323 --> 14:26.616
-Thank you, appreciate it.
-All right, enjoy it.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.537
Lamb is my favorite, so I gotta
see what this lamb is like.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.706
-And the fish is good.
-The fish is really good.

14:32.747 --> 14:33.707
You like the lamb?

14:33.748 --> 14:34.749
He got the okay?

14:34.791 --> 14:37.127
* Hell yeah! *

14:37.168 --> 14:41.297
* Hell yeah! *

14:45.468 --> 14:46.636
Nice.

14:46.678 --> 14:48.847
Here comes Natasha, what you
got this time?

14:48.888 --> 14:50.515
[cheering]

14:53.143 --> 14:55.729
So this is a
strawberry margarita.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.605
Oh, this is good as sh--.

14:57.647 --> 14:58.732
Zamn!

14:58.773 --> 15:00.608
-You’ve gotta put your wets on.
-Yep.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.318
Because you’re gonna be
taking the guests jet-skiing.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.361
Copy.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.947
Hey, Norma,
I need a deckhand.

15:05.989 --> 15:09.117
Yeah, unfortunately,
the guy here, he...

15:09.159 --> 15:10.410
Oh, you have someone?

15:10.452 --> 15:12.162
All right, terrific, thank you.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.628
Y’all ready to try...
are we doing water sports?

15:20.670 --> 15:22.505
Is your side secure?

15:27.344 --> 15:29.262
She asked, according
to the preference sheet,

15:29.304 --> 15:30.638
for a Hawaiian theme
for this.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.307
So, what we’ll do,
we’ll turn...

15:32.349 --> 15:33.933
surf-n-turf will be Hawaiian
on bridge deck aft,

15:33.975 --> 15:35.977
and we’ll do a Maltese
lounge on the sundeck.

15:36.019 --> 15:38.938
-Gotcha.
-Oh, toenail polish alert!

15:38.980 --> 15:40.398
Oh, yeah, it’s kinda beat up.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.984
All right, I’m gonna go
flower power this up.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.319
So, the jet-skis,
the trampoline,

15:44.361 --> 15:45.820
and the slide’s out.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.113
So, you guys are gonna
take us out on the jet-skis,

15:47.155 --> 15:48.323
if we wanna go?

15:48.365 --> 15:49.407
Yes, if you guys
have been drinking,

15:49.449 --> 15:50.408
I’ll be one of the people.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.618
We’ve been drinking.

15:51.659 --> 15:52.619
What a mess.

15:52.660 --> 15:53.453
We can do it.

15:53.495 --> 15:56.289
-Bye, Whitley!
-Bye!

15:58.458 --> 16:00.710
Woo!

16:07.217 --> 16:08.468
Get it, girl!

16:08.510 --> 16:10.970
Dave, do you have
a menu for tonight?

16:11.012 --> 16:12.389
Surf-n-turf, and then...

16:12.430 --> 16:14.391
-Surf-n-turf, like, plated?
-Yeah.

16:14.432 --> 16:17.936
Tonight for dinner they wanted
surf-n-turf,

16:17.977 --> 16:21.815
which confuses me, because
some people don’t eat meat.

16:21.856 --> 16:23.692
Normally, I would do beef
and lobster,

16:23.733 --> 16:26.194
but three people
don’t like lobster.

16:26.236 --> 16:28.780
So, this one could be
a tough one.

16:31.408 --> 16:33.201
About this Maltese singer
coming tonight,

16:33.243 --> 16:35.495
this woman’s actually
quite famous in Malta.

16:35.537 --> 16:37.038
Is she?

16:37.080 --> 16:38.540
Just sneak her up, we’ll get
the singer up there quickly.

16:38.581 --> 16:39.541
All right.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.002
Use these to sort of,
like,

16:42.043 --> 16:43.378
pull yourself down
with some momentum.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.717
Woo!

16:48.758 --> 16:49.843
Damn!

16:51.928 --> 16:53.096
[laughing]

16:59.519 --> 17:01.521
<i>Copy that, appreciate you.</i>

17:04.065 --> 17:05.734
Wanted to talk to you, if that’s
all right, for five minutes.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.861
Yeah.
What’s on your mind?

17:09.279 --> 17:10.739
Obviously, I understand
that I’m expected

17:10.780 --> 17:12.073
to delegate my team.

17:12.115 --> 17:13.074
You’re running
around too much.

17:13.116 --> 17:14.409
All right.

17:14.451 --> 17:15.660
Trust them, don’t try
to do their job.

17:15.702 --> 17:16.786
You know what I mean?

17:16.828 --> 17:18.538
-Yeah, yeah.
-Before someone new comes,

17:18.580 --> 17:20.290
I wanna put some sort of, like,
lead position in my team.

17:20.331 --> 17:22.834
But I’m in the situation
where I’ve got a very good

17:22.876 --> 17:26.087
friend that’s working really,
really, really hard,

17:26.129 --> 17:27.297
and then I had Courtney come in

17:27.339 --> 17:28.757
and just completely
blow me away.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.717
Like, I don’t have to ask;
it’s done.

17:30.759 --> 17:32.594
It really allows me to
concentrate on other things.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.429
For that reason,
I wanna go with her.

17:34.471 --> 17:36.681
But I just don’t
want it to cause any...

17:36.723 --> 17:38.308
because I know he’s
gonna be upset,

17:38.350 --> 17:39.309
because he’s been
working so hard.

17:39.351 --> 17:40.602
He’ll be fine.

17:40.643 --> 17:42.395
You’re doing it
based on performance.

17:42.437 --> 17:43.396
I’m doing it based on experience
and performance, yeah.

17:43.438 --> 17:45.065
Well, that’s awesome.

17:45.106 --> 17:48.193
Yeah, so, I’m gonna probably
do that this charter, so...

17:48.234 --> 17:49.361
Yeah.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.279
I don’t wanna
hurt my friend.

17:51.321 --> 17:52.781
This is just really
----ing hard, dude.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.909
-You’re doing a great job.
-Thanks, Cap.

17:55.950 --> 17:58.620
This is gonna be a ----ing
nightmare, bro.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.832
Coming up...

18:03.958 --> 18:05.377
Obviously, as a leader,

18:05.418 --> 18:08.213
you don’t want anyone
to see you break down.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.799
[sobbing]

18:23.478 --> 18:24.062
Is that it for today?

18:24.979 --> 18:25.980
I think so.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.399
How was it, was it fun?

18:28.650 --> 18:30.235
Cool.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.028
-Yeah, no worries.
-Okay.

18:32.070 --> 18:33.780
They’ll be on the bridge deck
aft, where she’s setting up.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.615
Y’all can take y’all
a break for a minute.

18:35.657 --> 18:38.368
Storm, do you want us to start
deflating the slide or anything?

18:38.410 --> 18:40.870
For now, we could start
packing away the chairs.

18:40.912 --> 18:41.955
Yeah.

18:41.996 --> 18:44.624
Oh, cy-ute!

18:45.709 --> 18:48.253
I love it!

18:56.469 --> 18:58.471
There always has to
be something, Kyle.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.559
Just a bit worried.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.977
We know that one person
doesn’t eat meat,

19:04.019 --> 19:05.937
but I’m not sure if
she eats fish or not.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.731
It’s the...

19:07.772 --> 19:10.150
It’s Whitley, the vegan one,
you mean?

19:10.191 --> 19:11.192
Yeah.

19:11.234 --> 19:12.610
She doesn’t...

19:12.652 --> 19:13.903
She said she eats shrimp,
she eats sea bass...

19:13.945 --> 19:15.071
Sea bass for her,
then, great.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.197
I’ll cook one or two.

19:16.239 --> 19:17.949
-Yeah.
-Just to have a back-up.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.668
Are you cute?

19:28.710 --> 19:31.004
Okay, the sound tech’s here,
on the swim platform.

19:31.046 --> 19:33.089
Ooh, yes, you look cute.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.883
Hey.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.259
Very hungry.

19:36.301 --> 19:37.594
I can’t wait to see what
the chef is gonna prepare.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.262
Everything’s been
so great so far.

19:39.304 --> 19:42.432
<i>Deck crew, deck crew,</i>
<i>is anyone able to help bring</i>

19:42.474 --> 19:44.059
<i>the sound equipment</i>
<i>onto the boat?</i>

19:44.100 --> 19:46.311
-This one’s heavy?
-Yeah, it’s heavy.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.520
Heavy, heavy, heavy.

19:47.562 --> 19:48.938
Maybe we can do one
handle each.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.398
-It’ll be fine.
-The guy’s on the bow.

19:52.484 --> 19:53.943
Holy sh--.

19:53.985 --> 19:55.278
-Have you got it?
-Yeah, I got it, it’s all right.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.696
-You’ve got it?
-Yeah.

19:58.615 --> 20:00.200
-Oh, how cute!
-That is adorable.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.077
Oh, no, Kyle, you’ve
got this one and me and Nat,

20:02.118 --> 20:03.119
we can get that one, okay?

20:03.161 --> 20:04.704
-Got you, yeah.
-Thank you.

20:04.746 --> 20:07.248
-We’ve got another one.
-All righty, from underneath.

20:07.290 --> 20:08.583
Yeah... ooh, ooh.
There’s a hole.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.251
Watch out.
I’m gonna let go.

20:10.293 --> 20:12.212
-Not only we’re lifting...
-Who runs the world?

20:12.253 --> 20:13.296
Girls!

20:13.338 --> 20:14.964
Wait, there’s holes everywhere.

20:15.006 --> 20:15.965
You’re a hole.

20:16.007 --> 20:17.092
Ooh, my ass.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.968
[bleep]

20:19.010 --> 20:22.347
Destiny better be
really good at singing.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.099
Ugh!

20:24.140 --> 20:25.475
Kyle.

20:25.517 --> 20:27.560
Is there an
empty human body in here?

20:29.312 --> 20:31.022
Holy sh--.

20:35.694 --> 20:37.987
So, tonight,
you know the surprise.

20:38.029 --> 20:39.531
Can you think of a
good distraction to,

20:39.572 --> 20:41.533
like, distract them for,

20:41.574 --> 20:44.911
like, 15 seconds, while
she gets up those stairs?

20:44.953 --> 20:48.331
Tash, swim platform, please.
Tash, swim platform, please.

20:48.373 --> 20:49.708
<i>Copy.</i>

20:52.460 --> 20:53.628
I think Jason’s been good today.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.171
-Yeah.
-Really working.

20:55.213 --> 20:57.465
-So, one step there... perfect.
-Oh, my gosh.

20:57.507 --> 20:58.717
I’m stoked, I’m gonna
tell him that.

21:00.677 --> 21:03.013
Yeah, take some photos.

21:03.054 --> 21:05.223
Hi, I’m Natasha, lovely
to meet you, Destiny.

21:05.265 --> 21:06.516
Hi, I’m Destiny,
nice to meet you.

21:06.558 --> 21:08.018
<i>Please, can I have</i>
<i>a guest update.</i>

21:08.059 --> 21:09.519
<i>I’m just coming up</i>
<i>now with Destiny.</i>

21:09.561 --> 21:12.522
Yeah, they’re still
in the foyer.

21:12.564 --> 21:14.399
Wait, where’s Whitley,
is she coming up?

21:14.441 --> 21:15.400
Yeah, she’s...

21:15.442 --> 21:18.737
Ah!

21:18.778 --> 21:20.280
It’s a surprise for the guests.

21:20.321 --> 21:21.656
-Okay.
-They don’t know.

21:21.698 --> 21:25.535
Okay, baby, move a bit in...
yeah, perfect.

21:25.577 --> 21:26.953
We gotta move the drink, yeah.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.166
<i>We now have Destiny</i>
<i>on the sundeck.</i>

21:31.207 --> 21:33.877
Yeah!

21:33.918 --> 21:35.295
Done.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.255
Well, I’ll let you get
comfortable and everything,

21:37.297 --> 21:38.882
and then we’re gonna bring
the guests up for dinner now.

21:38.923 --> 21:40.467
Okay. Thank you.

21:40.508 --> 21:42.719
And we managed to make it a
surprise, they didn’t see you.

21:42.761 --> 21:44.137
-Yeah.
-Okay.

21:44.179 --> 21:45.305
You look beautiful, by the way.

21:45.347 --> 21:46.306
-Thank you.
-I love your hair.

21:46.348 --> 21:47.349
Thank you.

21:47.390 --> 21:48.391
That’s pretty cool.

21:48.433 --> 21:49.601
She’s a Maltese celebrity.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.770
Myself, I’m not
much of a singer.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.191
I started at the age of six,

21:56.232 --> 21:59.819
and whatever boat I go on,
wherever I go in the world,

21:59.861 --> 22:02.322
I carry my baton
with me everywhere.

22:02.364 --> 22:04.991
Woo-hoo!

22:05.033 --> 22:06.242
It’s a luau!

22:06.284 --> 22:07.452
Ooh-la-la!

22:07.494 --> 22:09.037
It’s so cute!

22:09.079 --> 22:10.789
-Oh-em-gee.
-This is beautiful.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.083
-This is so nice.
-This is absolutely amazing.

22:13.124 --> 22:14.376
-Dave?
-Yeah.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.127
-We’re ready when you are.
-Copy...

22:16.169 --> 22:19.547
if you need to ask, sea bass
or Wagyu steak.

22:19.589 --> 22:20.674
Find out between
either of them?

22:20.715 --> 22:22.467
Gotcha... surf-n-turf.

22:25.220 --> 22:28.723
So, tonight’s theme
is surf-n-turf Hawaiian.

22:28.765 --> 22:32.936
You’ve got the option between
Wagyu steak or sea bass.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.562
I thought it was
"surf and turf."

22:34.604 --> 22:36.356
Like, a little bit of both.

22:36.398 --> 22:37.607
You can get a bit of both.

22:37.649 --> 22:38.608
-Yeah, like...
-One hundred percent.

22:38.650 --> 22:39.943
A bit of both.

22:39.984 --> 22:41.486
Mm, it should be half-half for
everyone?

22:41.528 --> 22:42.529
Except, obviously..
Except for Whitley.

22:42.570 --> 22:43.530
Yeah.

22:43.571 --> 22:45.156
They got you something special.

22:46.491 --> 22:47.450
All right, dude,
thank you so much.

22:47.492 --> 22:49.119
Good night.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.121
-I can help rinse some stuff.
-No, it’s all good, dude.

22:51.162 --> 22:52.497
-Dave?
-Yeah?

22:52.539 --> 22:53.498
-Tell me.
-Half-and-half.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.125
Half-and-half, so?

22:55.166 --> 22:57.210
They’re like,
"I thought it’s surf and turf."

22:57.252 --> 22:58.962
I’m like, yeah, yeah, we can
do half and half, no problem.

22:59.004 --> 23:01.131
No, it is surf-and-turf;
it’s coming with scallops.

23:01.172 --> 23:04.467
But some people don’t eat meat;
sea bass was the back-up.

23:04.509 --> 23:09.889
The scallop is the surf,
and then the turf is the meat.

23:09.931 --> 23:11.558
-Okay.
-Sorry, Dave.

23:11.599 --> 23:13.226
Like, this is a
right [bleep]-up.

23:13.268 --> 23:18.481
So, I might not have
explained it properly to Kyle,

23:18.523 --> 23:22.110
but it’s surf-n-turf, and
it’s meat with scallops.

23:22.152 --> 23:25.155
But what he...
he’s now...

23:25.196 --> 23:26.990
he’s offered now beef
and sea bass,

23:27.032 --> 23:31.411
so he’s basically just added
another course to the dish.

23:31.453 --> 23:35.832
The sea bass was just for
the one that doesn’t eat meat.

23:37.709 --> 23:40.045
-Coming up...
-----ing exhausted.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.131
Are you joking?

23:43.173 --> 23:44.466
Like, they would help us
in an instant.

23:44.507 --> 23:45.550
Just laziness.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.093
That stuff was so heavy,

23:47.135 --> 23:49.554
and he’s lugging it down
by himself, isn’t he?

24:01.691 --> 24:02.067
Sorry, Dave.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.152
No, this is a right [bleep] up.

24:04.194 --> 24:06.654
Shouldn’t have given
them the choice.

24:06.696 --> 24:08.323
Well, then let’s do two rounds.

24:08.365 --> 24:09.324
I will.

24:09.366 --> 24:10.575
I obviously ----ed up.

24:10.617 --> 24:11.951
I just need time
to cook the sea bass.

24:11.993 --> 24:14.496
I can serve
the surf-n-turf first,

24:14.537 --> 24:17.123
and then rush to get sea bass.

24:19.084 --> 24:20.502
Correct.

24:20.543 --> 24:23.505
If you’re legit dating
and dating different people,

24:23.546 --> 24:24.589
it gets expensive.

24:24.631 --> 24:26.091
-Yeah.

24:28.343 --> 24:30.679
Whitley, she’s only
gonna do the vegetables?

24:30.720 --> 24:32.806
Yeah, and everything else is
normal.

24:35.892 --> 24:37.394
I’ve done the steak medium-rare.

24:37.435 --> 24:39.312
I’ve got a little sauce here.

24:40.397 --> 24:41.439
Thank you, I was gonna ask.

24:41.481 --> 24:42.774
Whitley’s vegan.

24:42.816 --> 24:44.609
And then if you all
want some sea bass too,

24:44.651 --> 24:45.652
I’ll do that second round.

24:45.694 --> 24:46.986
-Happy with that?
-Yes.

24:47.028 --> 24:48.279
-Okay.
-You gonna eat the fish?

24:48.321 --> 24:49.864
Oh, no, no,
I’m good with the...

24:49.906 --> 24:51.533
-To get some protein?
-Are you sure?

24:51.574 --> 24:52.742
I’m good with the vegetables
and potatoes, thanks, Chef.

24:52.784 --> 24:54.619
I hope you enjoy it.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.246
Oh, that scallop is so good.

24:56.287 --> 24:57.831
----ing sea bass.

25:01.334 --> 25:03.628
I like these potatoes a lot,
I might get some more potatoes.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.296
Cook, mother----er.

25:12.512 --> 25:14.180
Would you like your
next plate with the fish?

25:14.222 --> 25:15.223
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

25:15.265 --> 25:16.391
Okay.

25:22.731 --> 25:25.817
A Gemini can go
from here to here.

25:27.277 --> 25:28.611
I’m like you.

25:28.653 --> 25:30.822
If I’m about to go off,
I will start crying first.

25:30.864 --> 25:32.991
Like, the passion will
leave my eyes,

25:33.033 --> 25:34.909
and I’m like, you better run.

25:34.951 --> 25:38.371
I’m not sad, I’m about to kill
you is what’s about to happen.

25:39.998 --> 25:42.250
Service, please,
in the galley!

25:42.292 --> 25:44.502
Coming.

25:44.544 --> 25:46.588
Ooh, wonderful.

25:46.629 --> 25:48.131
I’m sorry for the long wait.

25:48.173 --> 25:50.050
They’re coming up
in about two minutes.

25:50.091 --> 25:52.010
-Okay.
-Why aren’t you in bed, Storm?

25:52.052 --> 25:53.428
Me?

25:53.470 --> 25:54.512
Yeah, go to bed.

25:54.554 --> 25:56.222
-Unwinding?
-Unwinding.

25:56.264 --> 25:58.350
Are you gonna come
and watch her song?

25:58.391 --> 26:00.226
-I do.
-Yeah?

26:00.268 --> 26:03.355
Should call Natalya,
but she’s still stuck in cabins.

26:07.609 --> 26:08.568
How was your dinner?

26:08.610 --> 26:10.362
Everything has been awesome.

26:10.403 --> 26:13.114
Is everyone ready for
dessert up on the sundeck?

26:13.156 --> 26:14.366
What do you got for us, Natasha?

26:14.407 --> 26:16.034
Because you’re
full of surprises.

26:16.076 --> 26:18.370
Something sweet to be
up on the sundeck.

26:18.411 --> 26:19.454
It’s pretty awesome.

26:19.496 --> 26:21.081
Okay, let’s see.

26:25.669 --> 26:27.087
Look at them walking up for us.

26:31.716 --> 26:32.884
[laughing]

26:32.926 --> 26:35.178
Come on, baby,
the way she smiled.

26:35.220 --> 26:36.054
Ooh!

26:36.096 --> 26:37.430
She like she ready, girl.

26:37.472 --> 26:38.598
You about to sing!

26:38.640 --> 26:40.392
Hi, everyone, it’s Destiny.

26:40.433 --> 26:43.687
And tonight, I’ll be
performing a very special song

26:43.728 --> 26:47.565
to very special ladies
in front of me.

26:47.607 --> 26:52.237
-Ooh!
-Okay.

26:52.278 --> 26:56.408
* So, baby,
it’s not a maybe *

26:56.449 --> 26:59.411
* Yeah, I’m too good
to be true *

26:59.452 --> 27:00.745
Ooh!

27:00.787 --> 27:01.913
* There’s nothing
in it for you *

27:01.955 --> 27:04.249
* So, if I
show some skin *

27:04.290 --> 27:08.044
* Doesn’t mean
I’m giving in *

27:08.086 --> 27:10.588
* I’m not your baby *

27:10.630 --> 27:12.757
-Yeah!
-Woo!

27:12.799 --> 27:15.969
-All right!
-Yes!

27:16.011 --> 27:19.389
* Babe, are you hurting,
are you all right *

27:19.431 --> 27:24.894
* You look like an angel
that fell from the sky *

27:24.936 --> 27:27.063
* Hell, no, I am
not your honey *

27:27.105 --> 27:30.150
* Hell, no, I
don’t want your money *

27:30.191 --> 27:31.443
* Got it wrong,
I ain’t into dummies *

27:31.484 --> 27:33.153
* Nuh-uh-uh-uh *

27:33.194 --> 27:37.407
* So, baby, it’s not
a maybe, ha ha *

27:37.449 --> 27:39.409
* Yeah, I’m too good
to be true *

27:39.451 --> 27:41.578
* There’s nothing
in it for you *

27:41.619 --> 27:43.913
* So, if I show some skin *

27:43.955 --> 27:47.125
* Doesn’t mean
I’m giving in *

27:47.167 --> 27:49.794
* I’m not your baby *

27:49.836 --> 27:54.049
* Je me casse, ha ha *

27:54.090 --> 27:56.634
* Je me casse *

27:56.676 --> 27:59.554
* If you don’t get it,
please forget it *

27:59.596 --> 28:02.807
* Ladies, if you feel
like flaunting tonight *

28:02.849 --> 28:04.809
* It’s all right *

28:04.851 --> 28:09.981
* It’s all right, ladies *

28:10.023 --> 28:12.275
* Ladies, listen to me *

28:12.317 --> 28:15.278
* Listen and go right ahead *

28:15.320 --> 28:21.868
* Show you’re
shining bright, woo *

28:21.910 --> 28:25.205
* Je me casse, hey *

28:25.246 --> 28:27.123
* Excuse my French *

28:27.165 --> 28:30.418
* Baby, it’s not a maybe *

28:30.460 --> 28:33.254
* Yeah, I’m too good
to be true *

28:33.296 --> 28:35.131
* There’s nothing
in it for you *

28:35.173 --> 28:37.342
* So, if I show some skin *

28:37.384 --> 28:41.096
* Doesn’t mean
I’m giving in *

28:41.137 --> 28:43.556
* I’m not your baby *

28:43.598 --> 28:46.851
* Je me casse, ha ha *

28:46.893 --> 28:49.646
* Go, go, go, je me casse *

28:49.688 --> 28:52.524
* Go, go, go,
I’m not your baby *

28:52.565 --> 28:55.443
Woo!

28:55.485 --> 28:58.655
Holy cannoli, like,
she’s ----ing awesome.

28:58.697 --> 29:00.031
Thank you so much.

29:00.073 --> 29:01.741
-It was an honor.
-Thank you.

29:01.783 --> 29:03.201
To kill it on a short charter,

29:03.243 --> 29:05.161
you need to create
memorable moments.

29:05.203 --> 29:06.705
That was one of them.

29:06.746 --> 29:07.872
What a voice.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.916
And she smells good!

29:10.917 --> 29:12.627
Yes!

29:12.669 --> 29:14.212
-Thank you.
-Natasha!

29:15.630 --> 29:17.549
-Woo!
-Yay!

29:17.590 --> 29:18.800
Yes!

29:18.842 --> 29:20.051
You did amazing!

29:20.093 --> 29:21.386
Oh, my Lord.

29:24.431 --> 29:25.598
Huh?

29:30.854 --> 29:31.813
Yeah, I know.

29:31.855 --> 29:32.814
Okay.

29:32.856 --> 29:34.399
Come on, Susie!

29:34.441 --> 29:37.694
-Hey, Mzi’s doing some sh--.
-Sh--.

29:40.071 --> 29:41.072
[chattering]

29:41.114 --> 29:42.365
He said no.

29:42.407 --> 29:43.658
-Oh, come on!
-Come on, Mzi!

29:43.700 --> 29:45.869
Please, can you do
eight tequila shots?

29:45.910 --> 29:49.289
-Okay.
-Damn, we liquored up.

29:51.875 --> 29:53.585
Mm, I’m ----ing exhausted.

29:57.839 --> 29:58.965
Hey!

30:00.383 --> 30:02.135
Are you joking?
Like, go help out.

30:02.177 --> 30:03.803
Like, they would help
us in an instant.

30:03.845 --> 30:06.723
These two, the majority of the
time, are not doing anything.

30:06.765 --> 30:08.683
Like, it’s just laziness.

30:10.143 --> 30:11.770
-How you doing, man?
-No, no, it’s all good.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.396
It’s ridiculous.

30:13.438 --> 30:14.522
Guys?

30:14.564 --> 30:15.774
Yes?

30:15.815 --> 30:16.941
Mzi really needed help
lifting that stuff down.

30:16.983 --> 30:17.942
Pardon?

30:17.984 --> 30:19.444
That stuff was so heavy,

30:19.486 --> 30:21.571
and he’s lugging it down
by himself, isn’t he?

30:24.282 --> 30:25.450
It’s done now,
I’ve already done it.

30:27.410 --> 30:30.372
Right now, our main priority
is the actual guest.

30:30.413 --> 30:31.664
Guests can wait
for five minutes.

30:31.706 --> 30:33.041
It’s bullsh--.

30:43.259 --> 30:44.552
Mzi, next time, if you
just say listen, help me now,

30:46.096 --> 30:47.347
because that is just
absolutely bullsh--.

30:47.389 --> 30:49.349
-Um, Tash?
-Yeah?

30:49.391 --> 30:52.352
-She’s mental.
-I know.

30:52.394 --> 30:53.687
Sorry.

30:56.481 --> 30:58.358
Yes, please, you’ve
gotta get up early.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.359
Okay.

31:01.194 --> 31:04.406
Natalya’s not the easiest person
to be able to tell what to do.

31:04.447 --> 31:06.533
It’s starting to feel
like she just wants

31:06.574 --> 31:08.785
to try and undermine me
whenever there’s a chance,

31:08.827 --> 31:11.705
and it’s just,
like, stop it already.

31:11.746 --> 31:12.831
We are busting our ass,

31:12.872 --> 31:14.332
but yet she’s the one
who apparently

31:14.374 --> 31:16.292
always maintains
the pantry so wonderfully.

31:18.712 --> 31:20.422
Don’t take to heart
what Nat said.

31:20.463 --> 31:22.632
It’s just a young girl
still trying to figure out

31:22.674 --> 31:24.634
why things happen
the way they do.

31:28.179 --> 31:29.848
-Yes!
-Let’s shake some ass!

31:29.889 --> 31:33.518
-Yeah, shake some ass!
-Yeah!

31:33.560 --> 31:35.603
Yes, yes!

31:37.022 --> 31:40.233
-Hey!
-Oh, shots!

31:40.275 --> 31:42.277
Thank you.

31:44.237 --> 31:46.448
-Hey! Oh!
-Hey!

31:46.489 --> 31:48.408
Why do I feel like my
energy levels are crashing?

31:48.450 --> 31:50.493
Obviously we just
don’t work hard.

31:50.535 --> 31:52.120
All this.

31:52.162 --> 31:54.956
Woo!

31:54.998 --> 31:56.666
Hey!

31:56.708 --> 31:59.461
You gotta fall for
a minute, you gotta...

32:02.172 --> 32:06.092
-Woo-hoo!
-Yes!

32:06.134 --> 32:07.260
Hey, hey!

32:10.472 --> 32:12.265
I’m getting too old
for this sh-- man.

32:12.307 --> 32:14.517
We gonna roll
and we gonna sleep.

32:15.643 --> 32:16.936
Yes, honey.

32:16.978 --> 32:19.022
-Good night.
-Night, love.

32:19.064 --> 32:20.523
-Sleep tight.
-Toodleoo!

32:27.322 --> 32:29.032
* Whatcha gonna do, hey *

32:29.074 --> 32:30.617
* Whatcha gonna do *

32:30.658 --> 32:31.868
Who do you think we woke up?

32:31.910 --> 32:33.828
Everybody.

32:47.926 --> 32:49.803
Sorry I smell.

32:53.431 --> 32:55.141
Hello, good morning.

32:55.183 --> 32:56.726
What up?

32:58.186 --> 32:59.521
Morning.

32:59.562 --> 33:01.106
Pantry’s in a great place.

33:01.147 --> 33:03.024
Yeah, it is.

33:03.066 --> 33:04.609
I just need some
yoga in the shade.

33:04.651 --> 33:05.819
Are you gonna do
some yoga now?

33:05.860 --> 33:06.986
Is it the three of you?

33:07.028 --> 33:08.947
Yeah, so I’ll take one.

33:11.866 --> 33:13.660
-Hey.
-Hi.

33:20.542 --> 33:21.543
Yeah.

33:21.584 --> 33:23.461
All right, like,
do sun salutations,

33:23.503 --> 33:25.463
just to move your body-body.

33:25.505 --> 33:27.257
Whew, this smells.

33:27.298 --> 33:28.633
Let me sniff at your fingers.

33:28.675 --> 33:31.011
-No, but the...
-That’s off.

33:31.052 --> 33:33.179
Why, don’t you like cheese?

33:33.221 --> 33:35.598
Don’t be coming at me later
with your little cheese breath.

33:35.640 --> 33:37.892
Modified chaturanga,
deep inhale.

33:37.934 --> 33:39.436
Are we eating yet?

33:39.477 --> 33:41.062
Would you like us to
start bringing it out now?

33:41.104 --> 33:42.731
Yeah.

33:42.772 --> 33:44.524
When you’re in a receiving
mode, look what happened...

33:44.566 --> 33:46.317
she appears with
coffee and water.

33:46.359 --> 33:47.569
-Woo-hoo!
-Yeah!

33:47.610 --> 33:50.071
<i>Kyle, guests are ready to eat.</i>

33:50.113 --> 33:51.740
Gratitude, Namaste.

33:51.781 --> 33:52.866
Namaste.

33:52.907 --> 33:53.908
Run the breakfast now.

33:53.950 --> 33:55.160
-You want me to?
-Yeah.

33:55.201 --> 33:56.619
-Okay.
-They said they were coming out.

33:56.661 --> 33:58.955
I’m gonna swing this around.

34:02.042 --> 34:04.252
-Okay, we ready?
-Um...

34:04.294 --> 34:05.378
Oh, this is cute.

34:05.420 --> 34:06.504
This is handmade.

34:06.546 --> 34:07.714
I’m sad, I feel like imma cry.

34:07.756 --> 34:09.341
Jason, when you’re
done there,

34:09.382 --> 34:10.550
can you take the covers
off the chairs, please?

34:10.592 --> 34:11.509
Yeah.

34:11.551 --> 34:14.512
All right, they can go.

34:14.554 --> 34:16.890
Breakfast special.

34:16.931 --> 34:18.308
Thank you so much.

34:18.350 --> 34:20.435
Mm, Chef!

34:20.477 --> 34:22.145
I’m like, I love it, I wanna...

34:22.187 --> 34:23.897
It is pretty good, though.

34:23.938 --> 34:26.649
It is, like...

34:26.691 --> 34:28.943
That’s it, it’s
coming right for us.

34:28.985 --> 34:31.321
Hey, Cap, so, guest departure.

34:31.363 --> 34:32.739
Because of the weather...

34:32.781 --> 34:34.032
you can tell the wind’s
already picking up.

34:34.074 --> 34:35.533
Yeah, yeah.

34:35.575 --> 34:36.743
I wanna stay here on anchor
for our next charter.

34:36.785 --> 34:38.203
-All right, that’s fine.
-Okay?

34:38.244 --> 34:40.163
You can make the announcement.

34:40.205 --> 34:41.581
All crew, all crew,

34:41.623 --> 34:44.459
our guests will be
departing via water taxi.

34:44.501 --> 34:46.461
Prepare for guest departure.

34:51.841 --> 34:54.344
Do you wanna go get
your shirt on then quick?

34:54.386 --> 34:56.096
-Yeah, sure.
-Thanks, babe.

34:56.137 --> 34:57.430
Between the steps.

34:57.472 --> 34:59.307
Shall I clear any of these?

34:59.349 --> 35:00.475
Yes.

35:00.517 --> 35:01.768
I noticed
the change of wardrobe,

35:01.810 --> 35:04.020
so I guess
it’s coming up on time?

35:04.062 --> 35:05.188
Oh, no!

35:05.230 --> 35:06.773
All right, friends, let’s break.

35:06.815 --> 35:07.899
Yes.

35:07.941 --> 35:09.567
Storm, Storm,
guests depart within

35:09.609 --> 35:10.777
20 minutes, you understand?

35:10.819 --> 35:12.070
Copy that.

35:12.112 --> 35:15.448
I don’t wanna pack!

35:15.490 --> 35:17.283
-Really?
-Yeah.

35:17.325 --> 35:18.618
You going out tonight?

35:18.660 --> 35:20.453
No, but feel like
wearing chill...

35:20.495 --> 35:22.080
Yeah, like, in chill zones.

35:22.122 --> 35:23.790
Okay, you guys can be chill,

35:23.832 --> 35:25.166
but me and Tash are literally
getting ----ed I’m serious.

35:25.208 --> 35:27.127
No, we’re saying our outfits
are chill.

35:27.168 --> 35:30.296
Oh, yeah, yeah, gotcha.

35:30.338 --> 35:33.008
Learn, Kyle.
Listen before you speak.

35:35.385 --> 35:37.137
Natalya would cause me
to jump over here.

35:37.178 --> 35:40.807
-Yeah.
-Her voice is piercing.

35:40.849 --> 35:43.059
I’ve worked with
individuals with Natalya.

35:43.101 --> 35:44.310
This is not my first rodeo.

35:44.352 --> 35:45.812
It’s only gonna get worse.

35:45.854 --> 35:50.191
At some point I feel Nat
needs to be put in her place.

35:50.233 --> 35:52.485
Natalya wants to talk sh--
all the ----ing time.

35:52.527 --> 35:54.571
I don’t have two seconds
to get into that.

35:56.239 --> 35:58.074
They’ve got a taxi over here.

35:58.116 --> 36:00.076
<i>All crew, all crew,</i>
<i>to the aft deck.</i>

36:00.118 --> 36:02.287
<i>Line up on the stairs</i>
<i>for guest departure.</i>

36:02.328 --> 36:04.080
Copy.

36:04.122 --> 36:05.081
Thank you.

36:05.123 --> 36:07.834
[chattering]

36:07.876 --> 36:09.878
Ah, just show us
your best lunge.

36:12.005 --> 36:14.799
Man bun!

36:14.841 --> 36:17.010
Part two.

36:17.052 --> 36:21.848
These people are wonderful,
patient, serves with a smile.

36:21.890 --> 36:23.641
It’s beautiful,
beautiful to see.

36:23.683 --> 36:26.686
Thank y’all for having us,
we loved it, we love you.

36:26.728 --> 36:27.771
Hopefully, we’ll meet again.

36:27.812 --> 36:29.022
-We will.
-Yeah.

36:29.064 --> 36:30.523
-Thank you.
-I appreciate this.

36:30.565 --> 36:31.775
Thank you!

36:31.816 --> 36:32.984
Thank you for
bringing blessings.

36:33.026 --> 36:34.110
-Bye!
-Bye!

36:34.152 --> 36:35.904
-Bye!
-Bye!

36:35.945 --> 36:37.364
-Bye!

36:37.405 --> 36:38.865
Everyone, excellent job.

36:38.907 --> 36:40.617
Out of our whites,
into our reds,

36:40.658 --> 36:42.369
let’s meet in the main
salon for our tip meeting.

36:42.410 --> 36:43.370
-Woo-hoo!
-Amazing.

36:43.411 --> 36:44.579
Fantastic, thank you, Cap.

36:44.621 --> 36:46.373
Into our reds
and into our beds.

36:46.414 --> 36:47.582
* Dah-dah-dah *

36:52.754 --> 36:54.506
-Nice work.
-Thank you.

36:54.547 --> 36:56.216
Ooh, Lord.

36:56.257 --> 36:58.259
-Thanks.
-You’re welcome.

36:58.301 --> 36:59.969
I have to say,
like, you guys,

37:00.011 --> 37:03.390
from interior to
exterior, killed it.

37:03.431 --> 37:05.892
I just wanna say, Jason,
you’ve always been

37:05.934 --> 37:07.268
awesome on deck,

37:07.310 --> 37:09.396
and I’m so grateful.

37:09.437 --> 37:10.772
I found someone.

37:10.814 --> 37:13.316
He’ll be here before
the next charter,

37:13.358 --> 37:14.609
but thanks for working so hard.

37:14.651 --> 37:16.736
-I really appreciate you.
-Of course.

37:16.778 --> 37:19.197
Thank you,
and then $14,000,

37:19.239 --> 37:24.035
which is equivalent
to $1,272 per person.

37:24.077 --> 37:25.245
Cheers, everyone.

37:25.286 --> 37:27.455
-Woo!
-Cheers!

37:27.497 --> 37:29.416
Love it, everybody!

37:29.457 --> 37:31.042
Oh yeah, one more thing...

37:31.084 --> 37:33.837
since we’re on anchor,
who’s doing anchor watch?

37:33.878 --> 37:35.547
Okay, good, awesome.
Thank you.

37:35.588 --> 37:37.090
-Yeah.
-I’ll take a couple hours.

37:37.132 --> 37:39.426
Whatever side you want, I’ll
take whatever you want.

37:39.467 --> 37:41.094
I’ll tell you guys later.

37:44.264 --> 37:46.141
Oh, there’s more trash, guys.

37:48.768 --> 37:51.855
I mean, I hate touching
soaking-wet wash cloths.

38:00.321 --> 38:01.614
[sobs]

38:01.656 --> 38:03.575
These messages
from my boyfriend,

38:03.616 --> 38:06.619
I’m trying to ignore it,
but I am a person,

38:06.661 --> 38:08.705
and I do have feelings.

38:10.040 --> 38:12.375
Obviously, as a leader
in my position,

38:12.417 --> 38:15.253
you don’t want anyone
to see you break down.

38:17.005 --> 38:17.964
[Natasha crying]

38:42.364 --> 38:43.740
Jesus.

39:04.135 --> 39:06.971
That’s your main focus,
on this energy.

39:07.013 --> 39:08.765
I’m not even joking.

39:08.807 --> 39:11.101
Don’t even feel
selfish about it.

39:15.021 --> 39:17.023
-Okay, love bug.
-Yeah.

39:17.065 --> 39:20.193
No more tears left to cry,
only happy penises.

39:22.487 --> 39:23.822
Kyle.

39:27.283 --> 39:30.954
That’s gonna be too hot,
but that’s also kinda cute.

39:30.995 --> 39:32.706
Oh, my God, you look amazing.

39:32.747 --> 39:33.748
Thanks, honey.

39:33.790 --> 39:36.835
Ah, too many options.

39:36.876 --> 39:40.088
I am the salsa emoji
this evening.

39:40.130 --> 39:41.589
Yeah!

39:41.631 --> 39:43.550
Okay, let’s go, loves,
let’s go, let’s go. Vamos.

39:43.591 --> 39:45.218
Don’t leave it
a mess for Sandy.

39:49.431 --> 39:50.974
Woo!

39:53.476 --> 39:55.020
Well done, guys!

40:05.071 --> 40:07.699
Sometimes I think Nat
thinks that I look

40:07.741 --> 40:08.783
like someone
completely different.

40:08.825 --> 40:09.993
-Yeah?
-I agree.

40:10.035 --> 40:10.785
Yeah.

40:10.827 --> 40:12.162
Oh, here we are.

40:13.747 --> 40:16.708
-Nat, we’ve got the Prosec.
-Okay, I’m coming.

40:19.669 --> 40:21.338
Party car!

40:23.423 --> 40:24.841
I feel like it’s weird.

40:24.883 --> 40:26.301
If I was him, I would have
come over to everyone,

40:26.343 --> 40:28.345
or, like, said it at some point,
at least the deck crew,

40:28.386 --> 40:31.181
and been like, "Oh, by the way,
just so you know, I’m leaving."

40:34.309 --> 40:35.935
Starting tomorrow.

40:39.814 --> 40:41.399
Right here is where
Kyle kissed Frank,

40:41.441 --> 40:42.817
right where we’re sat.

40:42.859 --> 40:46.154
Oh, my God, this is it...
Frank, I love you!

40:46.196 --> 40:47.489
Oh, my God.

40:47.530 --> 40:48.865
Is she okay?

40:51.242 --> 40:52.660
-Hello, good evening.
-Hello.

40:52.702 --> 40:55.121
-Welcome to 506.
-Thank you so much.

40:59.209 --> 41:01.795
Are you guys nervous about
who’s gonna join your team?

41:01.836 --> 41:04.047
No, I’m not, I think
it’ll be fine.

41:04.089 --> 41:06.633
-Are you...
-I feel like Storm is.

41:06.675 --> 41:08.093
I don’t know who it is,
but other...

41:08.134 --> 41:09.260
Have you seen the résumé
or anything.

41:09.302 --> 41:11.054
The CV, we’ll be
in trouble, eh?

41:11.096 --> 41:13.765
Either the new deckhand’s
gonna take Courts by storm

41:13.807 --> 41:16.017
or Nat by storm.

41:16.059 --> 41:17.477
No.

41:17.519 --> 41:19.187
Is he lead deckie already?

41:19.229 --> 41:20.105
No.

41:20.146 --> 41:21.690
Here’s the news...

41:21.731 --> 41:24.234
I am the lead deckhand,
and I’m coming on tomorrow.

41:24.275 --> 41:25.777
What a surprise.

41:25.819 --> 41:27.028
So, you better pick up a rag
and you better wipe the windows,

41:27.070 --> 41:28.363
because I am watching.

41:28.405 --> 41:31.408
I’m gonna have an
iced coffee.

41:31.449 --> 41:33.827
Either way, anyone’s gonna be
better, I’m sorry, than Jason.

41:33.868 --> 41:34.828
I’ve gotta have
this conversation.

41:34.869 --> 41:36.204
What?

41:36.246 --> 41:37.664
I’ve gotta have
this conversation tonight.

41:37.706 --> 41:41.376
What convo?
What convo?

41:41.418 --> 41:45.547
[bleep] it, like, you know,
why not tonight?

41:45.588 --> 41:47.340
-Courtney.
-Oh, God.

41:47.382 --> 41:50.468
Rip the plaster off
and just do it.

41:50.510 --> 41:52.554
-What’s wrong?
-What’s happening, boys?

41:52.595 --> 41:54.681
It’s all good vibes.

41:54.723 --> 41:56.433
Why now is not
the time or place...

41:56.474 --> 41:57.642
What conversation?

41:57.684 --> 41:58.810
-About the lead deckhand.
-Oh, no.

41:58.852 --> 42:00.061
Why?

42:00.103 --> 42:01.312
About the lead deckhand,
and now he...

42:01.354 --> 42:02.439
Not tonight!

42:02.480 --> 42:03.982
Yeah, we’re gonna
get a new person,

42:04.024 --> 42:05.483
we don’t know who
the new person is.

42:05.525 --> 42:09.070
He or she might throw a
complete spanner in the works.

42:09.112 --> 42:10.822
Yep, you have
to choose a lead deckhand.

42:10.864 --> 42:12.782
-Yes.
-Okay.

42:12.824 --> 42:14.159
And this is nothing
against anyone else.

42:14.200 --> 42:15.326
Yeah.

42:15.368 --> 42:16.578
It’s been a very
hard decision for me.

42:16.619 --> 42:18.038
Yeah.

42:18.079 --> 42:20.665
What I would like to say is
that I’d like

42:20.707 --> 42:23.877
to make you my
lead deckhand, okay?

42:23.918 --> 42:25.628
I’d like to go with you,

42:25.670 --> 42:29.174
and you make it
what you wanna make it.

42:29.215 --> 42:31.718
Holy sh-- like,
what is going on?

42:31.760 --> 42:34.137
Like, obviously,
like, we’re out.

42:34.179 --> 42:35.722
And he’s a bit drunk,
so I’m, like, I don’t...

42:35.764 --> 42:37.432
I’m scared to believe it.

42:37.474 --> 42:39.267
I completely understand the
situation that you’ve been in.

42:39.309 --> 42:41.102
Like, I can understand
the stress.

42:41.144 --> 42:42.103
Like, Mzi’s your
----ing boy and, like,

42:42.145 --> 42:43.897
we bounce off each other.

42:43.938 --> 42:47.442
So, even though you’re making it
me, it’ll stay exactly the same.

42:47.484 --> 42:48.651
You are everything to me...

42:48.693 --> 42:50.195
Yeah, and...
and you are everything to us.

42:50.236 --> 42:51.821
There’s no need for
an explanation,

42:51.863 --> 42:53.239
I can tell you that right now.

42:55.658 --> 42:57.160
You wanna cuddle?

42:58.203 --> 42:59.371
Thank you,
I appreciate it so much.

42:59.412 --> 43:00.872
I love you.

43:00.914 --> 43:05.877
It is quite disappointing,
and also just a bit unexpected.

43:08.004 --> 43:11.299
Watch this energy come back
and just go whoomp.

43:17.472 --> 43:19.057
Storm.

43:20.684 --> 43:23.520
You see that Mzi’s
gonna take it so hard now.

43:23.561 --> 43:24.646
He is.
I know his face.

43:24.688 --> 43:26.856
You do not do...

43:26.898 --> 43:30.527
No, it’s not while you’re
drinking out of work hours.

43:32.237 --> 43:33.571
Yes, he is.
You are the bosun.

43:36.324 --> 43:37.826
So, what was I supposed
to do, just lie to him?

43:37.867 --> 43:39.244
Okay, it’s not lying
when you say

43:39.285 --> 43:41.287
let’s have a
conversation tomorrow morning.

43:57.637 --> 43:59.180
I can’t take you anymore.

43:59.222 --> 44:01.141
----ing hell, just get
the [bleep] out of my life.

44:01.182 --> 44:02.517
Honestly [bleep] off.

44:02.559 --> 44:03.977
Storm.
