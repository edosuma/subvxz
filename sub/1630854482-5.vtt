<i>Previously on
"Criminal Minds: Evolution"...</i>

00:04.134 --> 00:05.657
We thought these cases
were connected--

00:05.657 --> 00:07.529
the shipping container,
Rory Gilcrest,

00:07.529 --> 00:08.878
our spinal-cord guy.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.880
And now we have
our smoking gun.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.577
This is a network.

00:12.577 --> 00:14.753
This is the biggest case
we've ever had.

00:14.753 --> 00:18.453
And these missing kill kits
look more like time bombs.

00:18.453 --> 00:19.932
Tyler Green is our only lead

00:19.932 --> 00:23.327
on the most elusive killer
in 15 years.

00:23.327 --> 00:26.069
If this UnSub
has some form of IED,

00:26.069 --> 00:27.331
he's going to use it.

00:27.331 --> 00:28.593
He's heading into the park.

00:30.421 --> 00:32.945
Why would a serial killer
be carrying a fake bomb?

00:32.945 --> 00:35.818
You didn't join that network.
You infiltrated it.

00:35.818 --> 00:38.777
You people...
ruined... everything.

00:38.777 --> 00:42.607
Oh, my God.
He's my informant.

00:42.607 --> 00:44.131
Everything okay?

00:44.131 --> 00:46.046
I had to go in for a physical
and they drew blood,

00:46.046 --> 00:50.006
and my platelet count
was like over 400.

00:50.006 --> 00:51.747
It could be cancer.

01:11.854 --> 01:13.116
Please wait here.

01:13.116 --> 01:14.813
I'll let him know
you arrived.

the wrong direction

05:11.354 --> 05:12.747
from last time, though.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.226
I'm not crazy about that.

05:14.226 --> 05:16.359
Last time?

05:16.359 --> 05:18.883
Thanks, doc.

05:18.883 --> 05:21.495
Babe, what--
Thank you.

05:22.496 --> 05:23.932
How long have you known
about this?

05:23.932 --> 05:25.237
Not long.
Just a few months.

05:25.237 --> 05:26.587
Months?!

05:26.587 --> 05:27.849
Come on.
These tests can mean anything.

05:27.849 --> 05:29.241
There's no point
in making you worry.

05:29.241 --> 05:32.114
Okay, babe, well, now--
now I am worried.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.466
Is that work?

05:36.466 --> 05:37.728
Yeah.

05:37.728 --> 05:39.382
But I'm--
I'm gonna stay home.

05:39.382 --> 05:41.297
No, you're not.
Come on.

05:41.297 --> 05:45.083
I have a few more white
blood cells than normal.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.172

05:47.172 --> 05:49.044
I love your mama, but no.

05:49.044 --> 05:50.828
Then here's how this
is gonna work.

05:50.828 --> 05:53.222
You are gonna tell me when
the next set of results come in.

05:53.222 --> 05:57.008
And if you don't?
I'm not calling my mom.

05:57.008 --> 05:59.097
I'm calling <i>yours.</i>

05:59.097 --> 06:00.403
Honey, don't do that.

06:00.403 --> 06:01.839
Mm.

06:01.839 --> 06:03.493
Seriously.

06:03.493 --> 06:05.060
Come on.
That's not funny.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.541
That's kind of funny.

06:07.541 --> 06:10.152
That's not funny.

06:10.152 --> 06:13.982

no, no, no, no!

Nooooooooo...

06:22.294 --> 06:23.818
You done?

06:24.819 --> 06:27.648
Tyler Green spoke with
Sicarius online.

06:27.648 --> 06:30.999
That's evidence, and we need you
to help process it.

06:30.999 --> 06:33.610
Tyler Green forced me
back to the FBI.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.612
I'm very mad
about it still.

06:35.612 --> 06:37.745
And-- And he's
the problem.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.442
I'm not a problem.
I'm a delight.

06:39.442 --> 06:41.357
I'm a little dramatic,
but wonderful.

06:41.357 --> 06:44.099
And, also, he said
he didn't want my help.

06:44.099 --> 06:48.233
I'll take care of Tyler,
but can you play nice?

06:48.233 --> 06:49.670
No, no.
I can't play nice.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.193
And, also, we have a case.

06:51.193 --> 06:52.542
Can I help
with that instead?

06:52.542 --> 06:54.849
Trust me,
you don't want it.

06:54.849 --> 06:57.329
I deserve a gift certificate
to Soothe

06:57.329 --> 06:59.070
when this is all over.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.424
What the hell?

07:07.514 --> 07:09.516
Deputy director,
what are you--

07:09.516 --> 07:11.779
I've been asked
to oversee this case.

07:11.779 --> 07:13.520
Proceed like
I'm not here.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.304
I was not notified.

07:15.304 --> 07:17.393
Just came up.
Need-to-know basis.

07:18.655 --> 07:20.309
Now you all know.

07:23.138 --> 07:26.750
Okay, then.
Let's get started.

07:26.750 --> 07:31.146
We have two victims--
Sandra Hart and Claire Durham.

07:31.146 --> 07:34.497
Claire worked in
the Department of Education.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.760
Sandra was
a congressional page.

07:36.760 --> 07:39.110
Both of our victims
lived inside the District,

07:39.110 --> 07:41.504
but their bodies
were dumped in Virginia.

07:41.504 --> 07:45.639
So he crosses state lines.
Over 100 miles, too.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.771
It takes a lot of effort
to hide these bodies.

07:47.771 --> 07:49.817
Has a type--
young, beautiful,

07:49.817 --> 07:52.472
just getting their careers
in public service started.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.865
Yeah, and he gets them
to turn their phones off.

07:54.865 --> 07:57.651
I mean, Gen Z doesn't do that,
especially not go-getters in DC.

07:57.651 --> 08:00.480
One thing is for certain--
he has a hell of a ritual.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.351
I mean, cause of death
is strangulation,

08:02.351 --> 08:05.833
but pre- and post-mortem,
he bites them.

08:08.792 --> 08:11.534
Let's just cut
to the chase, Doug.

08:11.534 --> 08:13.841
You weren't asked
to oversee this case.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.582
You need us to do it.

08:15.582 --> 08:19.760
You had a personal connection
to one of these women.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.066
It was Claire,
wasn't it?

08:24.765 --> 08:26.201
Yes.

08:26.201 --> 08:27.855
Ms. Durham and I
dated briefly.

08:27.855 --> 08:30.118
It was perfectly
above board,

08:30.118 --> 08:31.859
but after a few months,
we decided--

08:31.859 --> 08:35.427
together--
that it wasn't working out.

08:35.427 --> 08:37.255
Bullshit.

08:40.258 --> 08:41.956
She broke your heart.

08:44.045 --> 08:46.090
Sir, a moment.

08:58.799 --> 09:00.888
Did you know
you tighten your mouth

09:00.888 --> 09:02.629
when you're hiding
something?

09:04.631 --> 09:05.980
What?

09:05.980 --> 09:08.112
It's classic
withholding body language.

09:08.112 --> 09:10.332
You're literally trying
to stop the words

09:10.332 --> 09:12.900
from escaping your mouth.

09:12.900 --> 09:16.207
You can't hide anything
from a team of profilers,

09:16.207 --> 09:19.210
so what else
do I need to know?

09:21.822 --> 09:25.347
Do you know about an app
called The Beltway Elite?

09:25.347 --> 09:28.002
I know it was on both
of the victims' phones.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.702
It's on mine, too.

09:32.702 --> 09:35.618
It's an exclusive dating app
for government employees.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.272
It matches you discreetly
with others.

09:37.272 --> 09:40.623
All photos and chats are deleted
at the end of every session.

09:40.623 --> 09:43.191
So it's like a Raya
for DC wonks.

09:43.191 --> 09:47.021
And it's also a perfect hunting
ground for a serial killer.

09:47.021 --> 09:49.893
That's why I can't let
anyone know about this.

09:49.893 --> 09:51.591
All you have in this job
is your reputation.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.463
Mine will be shot
if anyone finds out I'm on it.

09:54.463 --> 09:57.335
Prentiss,
I am begging you.

09:57.335 --> 09:59.468
Begging is worthless.

09:59.468 --> 10:00.817
I want action.

10:00.817 --> 10:02.253
Hands off the BAU.

10:02.253 --> 10:04.604
We solve this case,
you leave us alone.

10:06.257 --> 10:08.520
Of course.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.479
I mean it.

10:10.479 --> 10:12.568
I said "of course."

10:12.568 --> 10:16.485
Yeah, but you tightened
your mouth when you said it.

10:23.927 --> 10:26.277
I mean, I hate the guy,
but I get it.

10:26.277 --> 10:28.453
It is hard to meet people
in this town.

10:28.453 --> 10:31.021
It must be a relief
to be married, JJ.

10:31.021 --> 10:33.545
I mean, you don't have to deal
with this dating B.S.

10:33.545 --> 10:36.766
Mm, it comes with its own
set of challenges.

10:36.766 --> 10:39.508
Do you guys clock
these bite marks?

10:39.508 --> 10:41.379
Human teeth don't do that.

10:41.379 --> 10:44.165
He must be wearing some type
of dental appliance.

10:44.165 --> 10:45.557
If we can figure out
what kind,

10:45.557 --> 10:47.211
maybe that will help us
find him.

10:47.211 --> 10:51.389
Alvez and I can have the M.E.
set up a show-and-tell.

10:51.389 --> 10:55.655
Speaking of which, I think the
show is happening right here.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.700
Think Rossi will be able
to get anywhere with him?

10:57.700 --> 11:01.573
I think the real question is,
will he survive Garcia?

11:01.573 --> 11:05.186
It looks like Tyler Green
is "Garcia's Most Hated."

11:05.186 --> 11:07.014
Sounds like
you miss it, buddy.

11:07.014 --> 11:09.538
No.
He can have that title.

11:16.066 --> 11:18.982
Tyler, I'm SSA David Rossi.

11:22.072 --> 11:23.987
I was very clear
about her.

11:26.642 --> 11:28.688
You want to kill
this son of a bitch?

11:28.688 --> 11:29.906
Sorry?

11:29.906 --> 11:31.647
The guy who took
your sister.

11:31.647 --> 11:33.431
You want to kill him?

11:33.431 --> 11:34.868
Yes.

11:34.868 --> 11:37.871
Then I got to tell you,
there's nothing better

11:37.871 --> 11:42.353
than watching a psychopath
grow old in prison.

11:43.964 --> 11:46.227
So if you'll cooperate,

11:46.227 --> 11:51.406
I'll get the AUSA to knock
your charge down to time served.

11:53.234 --> 11:55.758
I'm not a fan of this either,
but it's come to my attention

11:55.758 --> 11:57.586
that if you lay a finger
on this keyboard,

11:57.586 --> 11:59.414
chain of custody
goes out the window

11:59.414 --> 12:03.853
and we lose anything you
give us as a material witness.

12:03.853 --> 12:06.508
The server's behind
a third-party firewall.

12:06.508 --> 12:07.857
You're gonna need
to launch a DDOS,

12:07.857 --> 12:09.337
then spear-phish
any bots that respond.

12:09.337 --> 12:10.904
Can you do that?

12:10.904 --> 12:12.775
Oh, gee whillikers,
Mister, and this whole time,

12:12.775 --> 12:15.082
I thought tiny monkeys
on little bicycles

12:15.082 --> 12:16.736
made a 'puter work.

12:16.736 --> 12:20.043
How's my lady brain gonna be
able to process--

12:20.043 --> 12:22.437
We're in.

12:24.787 --> 12:26.528
There's the flaw.

12:26.528 --> 12:29.009
I had to hide our conversations
in different sys-admin files

12:29.009 --> 12:30.706
because nobody ever
looks there.

12:30.706 --> 12:33.448
It's gonna take some time
to compile all of them.

12:33.448 --> 12:36.843
Alright.
Well, you kids get to work.

12:38.148 --> 12:39.584
Y--

12:45.852 --> 12:48.376
I know you're good,
but do you want me
to show you where I--

12:48.376 --> 12:52.946
I have devised
a set of rules for us

12:52.946 --> 12:55.252
so that we can work
well together.

12:55.252 --> 12:57.559
- Shall I share them?
- Yes. Good. Please.

12:57.559 --> 13:00.301
Rule numero uno--
we don't talk unless we have to.

13:00.301 --> 13:02.129
- What do you think?
- Love it.

13:02.129 --> 13:03.826
Mm. Excellent.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.186
Hey!

13:16.186 --> 13:19.711
<i>Ferme la bouche,
s'il vous plaît.</i>

13:25.021 --> 13:27.154
So he cleans
the wounds with bleach?

13:27.154 --> 13:29.852
Yes. Which wiped out any DNA
that wasn't the victim's.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.288
Forensic countermeasure.

13:31.288 --> 13:33.987
He knows his saliva is something
we can test for,

13:33.987 --> 13:35.945
even with an appliance in.

13:35.945 --> 13:37.642
And there were razors
on every tooth?

13:37.642 --> 13:38.992
Yeah.

13:38.992 --> 13:40.384
Especially sharp ones
on the canines,

13:40.384 --> 13:42.082
which are responsible
for the ripping

13:42.082 --> 13:43.779
and tearing of flesh.

13:43.779 --> 13:45.346
Whatever he's using
is efficient.

13:45.346 --> 13:47.435
Horrific,
but efficient.

13:47.435 --> 13:49.045
Well, if you could make us
molds of the bites,

13:49.045 --> 13:51.613
we can use those to make
a 3-D model of the appliance.

13:51.613 --> 13:53.528
- Of course.
- What about the hair?

13:53.528 --> 13:55.704
Can you tell what he's using
to lighten it?

13:55.704 --> 13:57.184
No.
We're still running tests.

13:57.184 --> 13:59.273
Okay, the hair on
victim number two here

13:59.273 --> 14:01.797
is lighter than the hair
on victim number one.

14:01.797 --> 14:03.668
Same progression
with the appliance.

14:03.668 --> 14:05.670
Deeper wounds,
more of them.

14:05.670 --> 14:08.848
Moving from sadistic biting
to ego-cannibalistic biting.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.501
He's escalating,
which makes me think

14:10.501 --> 14:12.068
that he's working up
to this.

14:12.068 --> 14:13.809
There have to be
precursor victims,

14:13.809 --> 14:16.725
someone he let live,
someone who escaped.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.466
Yeah.
Yeah, good point.

14:20.598 --> 14:23.079
JJ, we need you
to look for someone.

14:26.691 --> 14:30.391
Jessica, I know
that's hard to look at.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.654
I know you didn't want to tell
the police who did it,

14:32.654 --> 14:36.701
but we're hoping
you might reconsider.

14:36.701 --> 14:40.314
No, I'm sorry.
What happened was consensual.

14:40.314 --> 14:44.013
Consensual?
He sent you to the ER.

14:44.013 --> 14:46.755
Occupational hazard.

14:46.755 --> 14:49.236
Can I go?

14:49.236 --> 14:54.023
Look, Jessica, we know about
your solicitation record.

14:54.023 --> 14:56.547
That's not
why you're here.

14:56.547 --> 14:59.246
You're here
because of these two women.

15:02.423 --> 15:04.338
They both had bite marks
on them,

15:04.338 --> 15:06.644
and we think
it's the same man.

15:06.644 --> 15:08.559
He's escalated to murder.

15:09.299 --> 15:12.259
Jesus.

15:12.259 --> 15:15.827
I know that some of your
high-end clients

15:15.827 --> 15:17.786
make you sign an NDA.

15:17.786 --> 15:20.832
But an NDA can't shield them
from a felony.

15:20.832 --> 15:22.704
No, that's not why
I can't talk to you.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.401
Okay, then tell me why.

15:27.491 --> 15:29.102
When I went
to the hospital,

15:29.102 --> 15:31.843
that bastard's assistant
was already there

15:31.843 --> 15:36.326
with 50 grand and orders
to keep my mouth shut.

15:36.326 --> 15:39.460
Before the police
even got there, he was there.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.114
We can protect you.

15:41.114 --> 15:44.247
He doesn't have to know
that you cooperated.

15:44.247 --> 15:46.336
Are you kidding?

15:46.336 --> 15:48.991
Is that a joke?

15:48.991 --> 15:51.385
Do you know
how this town works?

15:53.343 --> 15:54.779
The answer is no.

15:54.779 --> 15:56.738
Now can I go, please?

16:00.220 --> 16:02.048
So, the lab techs
were able to mock this up,

16:02.048 --> 16:03.484
and we have agents
making calls, but...

16:03.484 --> 16:05.094
they're getting
the same answer.

16:05.094 --> 16:06.574
No dentist
would make this.

16:06.574 --> 16:09.490
Well, if he's on
Beltway Elite, he's connected.

16:09.490 --> 16:12.145
Maybe connected enough that
someone would make this for him.

16:12.145 --> 16:13.929
Yeah, probably so connected
that arresting him

16:13.929 --> 16:15.887
is gonna be a pain
in our ass.

16:15.887 --> 16:17.324
Hey, I just got confirmation.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.021
The tox-screen reports
came back,

16:19.021 --> 16:22.633
and both women had the date-rape
drug GHB in their systems.

16:22.633 --> 16:25.854
He's using more than just bleach
on their bodies.

16:25.854 --> 16:29.031
Ah, peroxide and alkaline agent
were applied to their hair,

16:29.031 --> 16:30.511
making it whiten.

16:30.511 --> 16:32.034
There's something
about the bite marks

16:32.034 --> 16:34.036
plus the hair
that's compulsive.

16:34.036 --> 16:36.778
It's a signature,
but to what end?

16:36.778 --> 16:38.954
Well, maybe he's breaking them
down postmortem in order

16:38.954 --> 16:42.175
to remake them in the image
of someone in his life,

16:42.175 --> 16:43.654
like a mother
or grandmother.

16:43.654 --> 16:45.134
If it's mother,
I mean,

16:45.134 --> 16:47.397
that speaks to some serious
Oedipal issues.

16:47.397 --> 16:49.269
Okay, so he never outgrew
the oral phase

16:49.269 --> 16:50.879
of toddler development,

16:50.879 --> 16:52.576
and it crossed over
into his love map.

16:52.576 --> 16:53.925
And so then,
as a pre-teenager,

16:53.925 --> 16:55.318
he craved
his mother's affection.

16:55.318 --> 16:57.059
When she didn't
give it to him,

16:57.059 --> 16:59.453
his latent psychopathic
impulses ran wild.

16:59.453 --> 17:02.151
So he kills these women
to turn them into his mother.

17:02.151 --> 17:04.893
To get the attention that he
didn't get when he was little.

17:04.893 --> 17:08.027
Or worse.
Maybe she did.

18:03.647 --> 18:07.129
Morning.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.305
How did you sleep?

18:09.305 --> 18:13.483
My cell doesn't have a mattress,
so, you know, not great.

18:13.483 --> 18:15.137
Oh. That sucks.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.704
I slept amazing.

18:16.704 --> 18:19.272
Big bed, plenty of pillows
that non-criminals sleep in.

18:19.272 --> 18:20.838
What happened
to rule number one?

18:20.838 --> 18:22.579
Rule number two--
I asked you a question,

18:22.579 --> 18:24.320
you have to tell me
the truth.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.757
You had tons of hackers
who would have wanted

18:26.757 --> 18:28.063
to help you
with that network.

18:28.063 --> 18:29.804
Why me?

18:32.241 --> 18:35.418
Why do you have so many pictures
of cats on your screensaver?

18:35.418 --> 18:38.813
They're weird
and standoffish.

18:38.813 --> 18:41.424
Yes, they are.
That's why I love them.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.122
You have to earn
a cat's respect.

18:43.122 --> 18:46.299
And that is not an answer.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.953
I studied the logs
we printed out last night.

18:48.953 --> 18:51.391
Bring up 23, 24, and 25.

18:54.742 --> 18:56.352
There it is.

18:56.352 --> 18:58.528
Right there.
The questions he asked you.

18:59.529 --> 19:01.183
He was screening you.

19:01.183 --> 19:02.532
From what I could tell,
he divided people

19:02.532 --> 19:04.621
in the serial killer
forum into two groups.

19:04.621 --> 19:05.970
The first is
the outside group.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.624
You know, wannabes
and sycophants.

19:07.624 --> 19:09.496
But if you answered
his questions correctly,

19:09.496 --> 19:11.367
he brought you
into the inside group.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.195
That's who he'd give
a kill kit to.

19:13.195 --> 19:15.850
But I couldn't see the pattern
to what he was asking.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.199
I can.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.506
He was looking
for particular traits.

19:19.506 --> 19:24.206
Promiscuity, glibness,
childhood impulses.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.904
The PCL-R.

19:26.904 --> 19:28.384
Oh.

19:28.384 --> 19:29.864
Ohhh!

19:29.864 --> 19:31.518
What? What--
What is that?

19:31.518 --> 19:33.346
Yeah, Reid told me
about this.

19:33.346 --> 19:36.218
In 1980, there was a
psychiatrist named Robert Hare,

19:36.218 --> 19:37.654
and he came up
with the PCL-R.

19:37.654 --> 19:39.352
It's called
the Psychopath Checklist.

19:39.352 --> 19:41.223
It's a detailed breakdown
of 22 traits

19:41.223 --> 19:44.139
that indicate psychopathy,
and they give it to inmates

19:44.139 --> 19:46.185
and people
in mental hospitals

19:46.185 --> 19:50.014
to determine how dangerous
they are, or relevant to us,

19:50.014 --> 19:54.193
who would be recruited
into a network of nutsos.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.238
Once he finds them,
he manipulates them,

19:56.238 --> 19:58.632
seduces them,
shows them how to kill,

19:58.632 --> 20:02.549
if they'll just
follow his rules.

20:02.549 --> 20:04.246
That's how he does it.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.596
That's how he built
his network.

20:11.427 --> 20:13.560
Is everything okay?

20:13.560 --> 20:15.257
No.

20:15.257 --> 20:17.216
The team found
another body.

20:23.831 --> 20:25.267
Our guy?

20:25.267 --> 20:27.269
Bitten, bleached hair,
app on the phone.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.531
All of it.

20:28.531 --> 20:30.359
Well, we now have
multiple dump sites.

20:30.359 --> 20:33.275
That should be enough to map out
our UnSub's comfort zone,

20:33.275 --> 20:35.146
where he lives,
works, and plays.

20:35.146 --> 20:36.887
Yeah, I've been
working on that.

20:40.935 --> 20:44.547
Problem is that each
of these locations

20:44.547 --> 20:46.375
are hundreds of miles apart.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.682
Whatever he's doing,
it ain't out of convenience.

20:48.682 --> 20:49.987
Okay, so he must be putting
the bodies here

20:49.987 --> 20:51.554
for some other reason.

20:51.554 --> 20:54.209
Emotional tie,
personal tie.

20:54.209 --> 20:55.863
Who lives around here?

20:55.863 --> 20:57.256
Nobody.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.171
Nothing but tobacco farms
around here.

21:00.171 --> 21:02.130
Get a survey
on property owners

21:02.130 --> 21:04.654
in a five-mile radius
around each dump site.

21:04.654 --> 21:06.439
It might not be
about convenience.

21:06.439 --> 21:08.528
It might be
about real estate.

21:21.584 --> 21:22.846
Hey, how are you?

21:22.846 --> 21:25.762
Um, did-- did
they find anything?

21:25.762 --> 21:29.070
It's just an inflamed thyroid.

21:29.070 --> 21:33.117
It can be treated with,
uh, Ampicillin.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.339
So not life threatening.

21:41.082 --> 21:43.171
Thank God.

21:43.171 --> 21:45.826
Don't ever do this
to me again.

21:45.826 --> 21:47.393
It's not fair.

21:47.393 --> 21:49.090
Fair?

21:49.090 --> 21:52.093
This is our marriage, JJ.
This is what we do.

21:53.616 --> 21:54.835
It is not.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.271
Oh, really?

21:56.271 --> 21:58.012
How many times you come home
from a case

21:58.012 --> 22:00.754
and say some serial killer
had a gun on you,

22:00.754 --> 22:02.146
but it was just fine?
Okay...

22:02.146 --> 22:03.757
That happened, like--

22:03.757 --> 22:06.107
Two weeks ago, when you had
to tackle the bomber.

22:09.502 --> 22:12.418
Okay.
You're right.

22:12.418 --> 22:14.420
So, let's change that.

22:16.552 --> 22:19.381
I don't want to be
in the dark anymore.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.383
I want to know.

22:21.383 --> 22:25.561
Well, that door swings
both ways, honey.

22:25.561 --> 22:28.347
You have to call and let me know
what you're walking into.

22:29.913 --> 22:32.263
Okay. I will.

22:33.482 --> 22:35.528
Oh, yeah?
What?

22:35.528 --> 22:36.790
You gotta prove it.

22:36.790 --> 22:40.271
You gotta pinky swear.

22:40.271 --> 22:43.362
I swear I will call you.

22:44.885 --> 22:46.365
Alright.

22:49.280 --> 22:52.327
I'm so, so glad you're okay.

22:52.675 --> 22:54.677
Mm.

22:54.677 --> 22:56.636
Alright.
Mm.

23:05.079 --> 23:06.472
You pinky swore.

23:06.472 --> 23:08.430
That's no joke.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.084
You better call.

23:18.919 --> 23:20.921
What did you find?

23:20.921 --> 23:23.010
We found the significance
of the three disposal sites

23:23.010 --> 23:24.403
to our UnSub.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.057
He dumps the bodies
next to properties

23:27.057 --> 23:29.538
all belonging to her.

23:29.538 --> 23:32.193
Senator Martha Reeves
from Virginia.

23:32.193 --> 23:33.673
So, this is politically motivated.

23:33.673 --> 23:35.588
No. Only a handful
of her inner circle knew

23:35.588 --> 23:38.199
that her tobacco farms
funded her senate campaign.

23:38.199 --> 23:39.809
Who does fit the profile?

23:39.809 --> 23:41.898
Her son, Benjamin.

23:41.898 --> 23:43.683
Wait a minute.
Stop right there.

23:43.683 --> 23:46.468
Multiple arrests for possession
and assault as a teenager,

23:46.468 --> 23:49.297
including an attack on her third
husband on their wedding night.

23:49.297 --> 23:51.386
Now, the profile calls
for an Oedipal motivation.

23:51.386 --> 23:53.083
It does not get much more
Oedipal than that.

23:53.083 --> 23:56.347
Stop. I-I don't care
what the profile says.

23:56.347 --> 23:59.394
We are not arresting a sitting
senator's son based on a theory.

23:59.394 --> 24:00.961
Then let us prove it.

24:00.961 --> 24:02.745
Give us approval to put him
under surveillance.

24:02.745 --> 24:04.486
No.
Absolutely not.

24:04.486 --> 24:07.881
Douglas, do you want to catch
Claire Durham's killer?

24:07.881 --> 24:11.450
Because you can either
protect the people you serve

24:11.450 --> 24:14.627
or protect your ass,
but you can't do both.

24:18.239 --> 24:19.632
The answer is still no.

24:19.632 --> 24:23.418
But senators have staffs.

24:23.418 --> 24:25.507
So do their children.

24:25.507 --> 24:26.856
Start there.

24:26.856 --> 24:29.250
That's as much rope
as I can give you.

24:36.910 --> 24:39.390
Jessica Sayer said
that an assistant

24:39.390 --> 24:41.480
was waiting for her
in the hospital.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.916
That's who
we need to locate.

24:42.916 --> 24:44.178
Yeah.

24:51.359 --> 24:53.187
Little early, isn't it?

24:53.187 --> 24:55.668
- It's 3:00 PM, sir.
- Like I said.

24:55.668 --> 24:57.017
Early.

24:58.801 --> 25:00.324
What do you want?

25:00.324 --> 25:02.849
I got word from a friend
that the FBI is interested

25:02.849 --> 25:04.720
in a case that involves us.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.592
Well, handle it.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.811
Benjamin, it's
a federal investigation.

25:08.811 --> 25:12.293
I just can't...
"handle" it.

25:12.293 --> 25:14.556
Well, that's a problem.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.253
Benjamin?

25:18.952 --> 25:20.693
Give us a minute.

25:22.608 --> 25:25.436
You haven't RSVP'd
for the Foster Youth Event.

25:25.436 --> 25:28.352
Mm.
Must've slipped my mind.

25:28.352 --> 25:29.832
I did it for you.

25:29.832 --> 25:31.704
We have to rehabilitate
your image,

25:31.704 --> 25:34.228
get you back out
on the fundraising circuit.

25:34.228 --> 25:35.664
Ah.

25:35.664 --> 25:37.274
<i>My</i> image?

25:37.274 --> 25:38.972
Don't you mean
your image?

25:38.972 --> 25:42.323
Last I heard, you were down
with MILFs by six points.

25:42.323 --> 25:43.629
Showing up with me
on your arm

25:43.629 --> 25:45.848
isn't gonna make you
mother of the year.

25:45.848 --> 25:47.807
Benjamin.

25:47.807 --> 25:50.418
Put the glass down.

25:50.418 --> 25:52.246
Now.

25:58.078 --> 25:59.688
Here.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.667
You will be there.

26:23.930 --> 26:26.062
And you will not argue.

26:27.411 --> 26:29.109
Am I clear?

26:33.679 --> 26:35.376
Yes.

26:38.771 --> 26:40.424
Good.

27:12.674 --> 27:16.286
Alright, we know how Sicarius
screens his psychopaths,

27:16.286 --> 27:19.028
but it's a long way
to get them to commit suicide.

27:19.028 --> 27:21.335
That's where the social
engineering comes into play.

27:21.335 --> 27:23.685
From what I could tell,
he was very good at it.

27:23.685 --> 27:25.948
I'll say.
He tricked you.

27:25.948 --> 27:27.689
Excuse me?

27:29.735 --> 27:31.084
I'll bite.

27:31.084 --> 27:32.607
What am I missing?

27:32.607 --> 27:35.697
Your background
in psychological operations.

27:35.697 --> 27:38.918
You got him to talk to you,
but only for the first week.

27:38.918 --> 27:41.442
He was able to see through you
when you started
asking questions.

27:41.442 --> 27:43.705
That fake bomb thing-- you
thought you were exposing him.

27:43.705 --> 27:45.315
He was exposing you.

27:45.315 --> 27:47.578
He was a couple steps
ahead of you the whole time.

27:47.578 --> 27:50.016
It's funny, after I snagged some
encrypted coordinates from him,

27:50.016 --> 27:52.105
I thought he was
being careless.

27:52.105 --> 27:55.761
You got lucky,
at best.

27:55.761 --> 27:58.285
I did.

27:58.285 --> 28:00.374
Just like I got lucky
when I searched out

28:00.374 --> 28:03.464
the biggest, baddest
hacker of them all.

28:03.464 --> 28:05.466
- Called the Black Queen.
- Kid, shut up.

28:05.466 --> 28:07.381
When I found her
on a social media network,

28:07.381 --> 28:10.297
I was like,
"What? This is her?

28:10.297 --> 28:12.778
With the kitten memes
and the unicorns?"

28:12.778 --> 28:17.130
But then I was like,
"No, it's my way in."

28:17.130 --> 28:19.219
If I told her that people would
die if she didn't help,

28:19.219 --> 28:20.742
she'd give me
whatever I wanted.

28:20.742 --> 28:25.312
And that is how I got my hands
on a kill kit.

28:25.312 --> 28:28.228
So, maybe he tricked me,
but I tricked you.

28:37.367 --> 28:40.762
You don't know how to quit
when you're behind, do you?

28:46.812 --> 28:48.291
He walked in?

28:48.291 --> 28:49.684
Mitch Nevins.

28:49.684 --> 28:51.773
Personal assistant
to Benjamin Reeves.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.775
Timing's a little
too good.

28:53.775 --> 28:55.255
Don't let
your guard down.

28:55.255 --> 28:56.604
Yeah.

28:59.476 --> 29:01.522
You don't understand
what it took me to come here.

29:01.522 --> 29:03.393
Let's start
at the beginning.

29:03.393 --> 29:05.613
What exactly do you know
about your boss,

29:05.613 --> 29:07.267
Benjamin Reeves?

29:07.267 --> 29:09.269
I can't talk unless
I have immunity.

29:09.269 --> 29:11.575
Full stop.

29:11.575 --> 29:13.403
Do you know about this?

29:30.420 --> 29:32.988
The hell?

29:32.988 --> 29:35.904
He's a little too
into those photos.

29:35.904 --> 29:39.690
And we said that someone had to
make the appliance for Reeves?

29:39.690 --> 29:41.127
Shit.
It's a partnership.

29:41.127 --> 29:42.476
You don't understand.

29:45.653 --> 29:47.481
I've done things.

29:47.481 --> 29:49.135
What kind of things?

29:49.135 --> 29:51.267
Do you do them
with Benjamin?

29:51.267 --> 29:53.966
Benjamin?

29:53.966 --> 29:56.533
No.

29:56.533 --> 29:59.188
Benjamin has no idea.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.190
Take JJ.

30:01.190 --> 30:03.845
I want him arrested
and his car searched now.

30:39.228 --> 30:42.579
So, we found the teeth.
A little too easily.

30:42.579 --> 30:43.842
We're being played.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.365
I reviewed the video.

30:45.365 --> 30:47.236
Mitch danced all the way up
to incriminating himself,

30:47.236 --> 30:48.890
but he never
actually said it.

30:48.890 --> 30:50.761
Yeah, well, it gets worse.
We checked his phone.

30:50.761 --> 30:52.415
He was nowhere
near the dump site.

30:52.415 --> 30:54.765
He's completely
wasting our time.

30:57.594 --> 31:00.075
This is all a smoke screen,
isn't it?

31:00.075 --> 31:02.599
Why are you covering
for Benjamin Reeves?

31:02.599 --> 31:04.340
Lawyer.

31:08.257 --> 31:09.911
Jessica.

31:25.405 --> 31:27.059
Shh, shh.

31:27.059 --> 31:29.409
You look
good enough to eat.

31:40.420 --> 31:43.075
So, how you been, Jessica?

31:43.075 --> 31:44.685
Did you miss me?

31:46.121 --> 31:48.515
Mm, I bet you did.

31:48.515 --> 31:53.781
I bet you think about me
every day, don't you?

31:58.829 --> 32:01.049
Now, who could that be?

32:01.049 --> 32:02.529
<i>Penelope,
what do you got?</i>

32:02.529 --> 32:05.010
A whole lot.
Jessica Sayer's phone is pinging

32:05.010 --> 32:07.490
in a city parking garage
off of Main and First.

32:07.490 --> 32:09.579
Fly fast, super-ladies.
Mama needs some good news.

32:09.579 --> 32:11.407
Hanging by a thread over here.
Make it happen.

32:11.407 --> 32:14.541
<i>We're two minutes away.</i>

32:14.541 --> 32:17.413
I heard someone's been
asking questions about me.

32:19.676 --> 32:21.374
They come see you?

32:23.680 --> 32:25.639
Yes.

32:25.639 --> 32:27.771
What did they want to know?

32:27.771 --> 32:32.907
Uh, they asked about other
women, women I didn't know.

32:32.907 --> 32:37.042
Benjamin, I didn't tell them
anything, I swear.

32:37.042 --> 32:40.001
Yeah, that's the problem.

32:40.001 --> 32:41.698
You might.

32:51.795 --> 32:53.884
FBI! Hands up!

32:56.887 --> 32:59.847
Benjamin Reeves,
you're under arrest.

33:08.160 --> 33:09.596
God--

33:09.596 --> 33:11.076
You arrested him?

33:11.076 --> 33:14.427
He was in a car with
Jessica Sayer and he was armed.

33:14.427 --> 33:15.776
What were we supposed to do?

33:15.776 --> 33:17.038
Does the senator know?

33:17.038 --> 33:19.040
No, and he hasn't invoked.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.303
Textbook narcissism.

33:21.303 --> 33:23.262
I'm gonna have to thread
the needle just right

33:23.262 --> 33:25.394
to get a confession
out of him.

33:25.394 --> 33:28.310
We can't do this.
Do you understand?

33:28.310 --> 33:32.445
Prentiss, if you go in there,
we will all get fired.

33:32.445 --> 33:34.838
Tell me about
Claire Durham.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.625
W-Why?

33:38.625 --> 33:40.322
When we looked into
Benjamin's phone,

33:40.322 --> 33:42.542
we didn't just find
The Beltway app.

33:42.542 --> 33:45.545
We also discovered he was
one of the company's founders.

33:45.545 --> 33:49.331
He started it so he could
hunt women like Claire on it.

33:49.331 --> 33:51.290
That means you're the closest
person we can talk to

33:51.290 --> 33:53.292
to get a sense
of his victimology.

33:53.292 --> 33:56.208
What was Claire like?

33:56.208 --> 33:57.905
Young.

33:57.905 --> 33:59.559
Aggressive.

33:59.559 --> 34:00.908
Like the senator?

34:00.908 --> 34:03.824
No, just... determined.

34:03.824 --> 34:06.087
Good relationship
- with her mother?
- Yeah.

34:06.087 --> 34:08.611
She got along with her
whole family, actually.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.271
The f--
W-What are you doing?

34:16.271 --> 34:17.707
Giving him what he wants.

34:17.707 --> 34:19.187
Mommy.

34:19.187 --> 34:22.886
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Prentiss, don't do that.

34:22.886 --> 34:24.932
Get out of my face
or I'll cut your balls off

34:24.932 --> 34:26.803
and feed them to you.

34:26.803 --> 34:28.979
Good luck.

34:36.422 --> 34:38.685
Benjamin.

34:38.685 --> 34:41.688
You've been a bad boy,
haven't you?

34:43.385 --> 34:45.039
Who are you?

34:45.039 --> 34:48.129
Emily Prentiss. FBI.

34:48.129 --> 34:49.957
I haven't done
anything wrong.

34:49.957 --> 34:52.786
You had a gun
on Jessica Sayer.

34:52.786 --> 34:54.875
No, I had a gun
on myself.

34:54.875 --> 34:56.616
Not her.

34:56.616 --> 35:00.098
According to my Second Amendment
rights, that's allowed.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.622
So, what were
you two doing?

35:02.622 --> 35:06.365
Just chatting,
like we are right now.

35:06.365 --> 35:08.802
Oh, well, if we're having
a little chat,

35:08.802 --> 35:12.893
why don't you tell me
about Sandra, Claire, and Rose?

35:13.807 --> 35:15.635
Who's that?

35:15.635 --> 35:17.898
You know who.

35:17.898 --> 35:21.249
And I know why.

35:21.249 --> 35:24.992
See, nobody else could
figure out about the hair.

35:24.992 --> 35:26.646
But I get it.

35:26.646 --> 35:31.433
Because when I stopped
dying mine, it felt so good.

35:31.433 --> 35:33.218
Like, uh...

35:33.218 --> 35:38.440
Like I was finally freeing
who I really am.

35:38.440 --> 35:42.183
There's this idea,
about women of a certain age,

35:42.183 --> 35:45.099
that we're not
relevant anymore.

35:45.099 --> 35:46.492
Sexually.

35:46.492 --> 35:50.452
But I have gotten
so much attention.

35:50.452 --> 35:53.194
My kid doesn't like it,
but whatever.

35:53.194 --> 35:55.065
Fuck him, you know?

35:55.065 --> 35:57.372
- Wait, does she have a kid?
- Shh. No.

35:57.372 --> 35:59.635
Watch what happens next.

35:59.635 --> 36:03.030
That's how you talk?
About your son?

36:03.030 --> 36:07.382
That's how you were spoken to,
isn't that right?

36:07.382 --> 36:10.516
That's why you turned
those women into your mother.

36:10.516 --> 36:14.911
So somebody, <i>anybody</i>
wouldn't see you

36:14.911 --> 36:17.305
as the pathetic waste
of space you are--

36:17.305 --> 36:18.611
I'm not pathetic.

36:18.611 --> 36:20.961
What are you gonna be
remembered for,

36:20.961 --> 36:25.095
besides just a footnote
in your mother's obituary?

36:26.749 --> 36:29.491
Well, they'll remember
Derrick Sesper.

36:32.451 --> 36:35.323
That's who I used
the Sicarius spiders on.

36:35.323 --> 36:36.933
Carmen Gomez from 2007.

36:36.933 --> 36:38.805
John Harris.

36:38.805 --> 36:40.720
He was a wimp.

36:40.720 --> 36:43.026
What is he talking about?

36:43.026 --> 36:47.205
He's naming names from
the Sicarius shipping container.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.381
None of those names
are public knowledge.

36:49.381 --> 36:52.122
Susan Abel, Kalen Jones.

36:52.122 --> 36:54.255
Should I keep going?

36:54.255 --> 36:56.170
You're connected.

36:56.170 --> 36:58.346
Somebody could have leaked
those names to you.

36:58.346 --> 37:01.349
You want to impress me,
tell me something I don't know.

37:05.179 --> 37:08.138
Whitfield County, Georgia.

37:09.749 --> 37:12.230
What's out there?

37:12.230 --> 37:14.797
More buried treasure.

37:14.797 --> 37:17.713
Just full of surprises.

37:23.589 --> 37:27.288
- They found us.
- Who?

37:27.288 --> 37:29.421
You are to stop asking my client
questions right now

37:29.421 --> 37:31.031
or I'll have your ass

37:31.031 --> 37:33.120
on Fourth and Sixth Amendment
rights violations.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.601
And you, shut up.
Don't say another word.

37:51.399 --> 37:54.446
Is there any way Benjamin Reeves
actually is Sicarius?

37:54.446 --> 37:56.099
No.
The timeline doesn't match.

37:56.099 --> 37:58.624
He was attending college in
England when Sicarius started.

37:58.624 --> 38:01.540
But naming those names,
he's integral to the network.

38:01.540 --> 38:04.282
If I'd had five more minutes, I
could have gotten it out of him.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.500
There's got to be
another way in.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.197
Prentiss, it is over.

38:07.197 --> 38:08.677
Maybe for all of us.

38:08.677 --> 38:10.157
No.

38:10.157 --> 38:11.680
Not yet, it's not.

38:12.942 --> 38:14.683
Benjamin Reeves
just confessed

38:14.683 --> 38:16.859
to multiple murders
around the country.

38:16.859 --> 38:20.036
So, here's the deal, Mitch.

38:20.036 --> 38:23.779
You either cooperate now
and tell us what you know,

38:23.779 --> 38:26.565
or we arrest you
as an accomplice.

38:29.045 --> 38:30.656
That's it?

38:30.656 --> 38:32.048
That's your offer?

38:32.048 --> 38:35.443
Reeves will not escape
justice, Mitch.

38:35.443 --> 38:38.272
Don't go down with him.

38:38.272 --> 38:40.361
Justice?

38:40.361 --> 38:43.669
There's no justice
in this country.

38:43.669 --> 38:47.716
This country's a kleptocracy.
Always has been.

38:52.199 --> 38:54.897
Now take me to jail.

38:54.897 --> 38:56.551
Mitch won't talk.

38:56.551 --> 38:59.641
He's banking on the Reeves
family bailing him out.

38:59.641 --> 39:01.948
Who are we kidding?
It's a safe bet.

39:01.948 --> 39:04.385
Copy that.
Thank you.
What do you got?

39:04.385 --> 39:07.040
Atlanta Field Office is setting
up a search in Whitfield County.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.694
They're happy
to take our help. Good.

39:08.694 --> 39:11.131
I want both you and Luke
in Georgia by nightfall.

39:11.131 --> 39:12.654
Take it acre by acre
if you have to.

39:12.654 --> 39:14.003
On it.

39:14.003 --> 39:16.528
If Reeves knows so much
about Sicarius,

39:16.528 --> 39:19.052
there might be chats
between them on the network.

39:19.052 --> 39:20.575
Say no more.

39:21.576 --> 39:25.667
Does the name
Benjamin Reeves ring a bell?

39:25.667 --> 39:27.060
No. Why?

39:27.060 --> 39:29.541
It's a possible
Sicarius connection.

39:29.541 --> 39:31.847
Senator's son.
Wannabe cannibal.

39:31.847 --> 39:33.414
That rings a bell.

39:33.414 --> 39:35.895
Search the term
"overbite."

39:35.895 --> 39:37.375
Alright, hold on.

39:38.941 --> 39:42.641
Think they could make these
damn keyboards any smaller?

39:42.641 --> 39:45.208
From what I could tell,
Sicarius needed a benefactor.

39:45.208 --> 39:48.124
In exchange, he agreed
to show him how to kill.

39:48.124 --> 39:49.822
He even made
something for him.

39:49.822 --> 39:51.432
See? Right there.

39:51.432 --> 39:55.088
"The device is on its way.
It should fix your overbite.

39:55.088 --> 39:58.004
Meet me in
the private chat."

39:58.004 --> 39:59.962
Well, here's
the real mystery.

39:59.962 --> 40:01.964
Rich kids with
political connections

40:01.964 --> 40:04.402
don't kill themselves.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.447
Why draw him
into the fold?

40:06.447 --> 40:10.103
It takes a lot of money
to pull a network this size off.

40:10.103 --> 40:12.410
This guy Reeves, right?

40:12.410 --> 40:14.368
He wanted
special privileges.

40:14.368 --> 40:16.457
So, Sicarius invited him
into the private forum

40:16.457 --> 40:17.850
to tell him everything.

40:17.850 --> 40:20.374
- Where's the forum?
- I don't know.

40:20.374 --> 40:22.245
Nobody does.

40:22.245 --> 40:25.466
Yeah, but we both know
someone who can find it,

40:25.466 --> 40:27.381
and we don't have
a lot of time.

40:30.950 --> 40:32.604
Fine.
Bring her back in.

40:32.604 --> 40:34.344
Oh, I'm not.

40:34.344 --> 40:36.216
You are.

40:42.962 --> 40:44.224
Come in.

40:48.402 --> 40:50.143
I said come in!

40:51.623 --> 40:54.582
I can't.
The door is locked.

41:06.376 --> 41:10.468
Look, clearly, you don't like me
and I don't like you.

41:10.468 --> 41:11.817
It's, I dunno, pheromonal,

41:11.817 --> 41:13.601
or maybe because
you blew my life up.

41:13.601 --> 41:16.343
So, why don't you go get help
from one of the other dozen

41:16.343 --> 41:17.866
I.T. people who work
for the FBI?

41:17.866 --> 41:19.738
They're not
as good as you.

41:19.738 --> 41:22.044
That's the other reason
why I found you.

41:22.044 --> 41:23.785
I knew you're the best.

41:28.529 --> 41:30.575
How do I know you're not
a boundary-breaking

41:30.575 --> 41:32.359
jerkface forever?

41:35.101 --> 41:36.798
I brought
a peace offering.

41:41.673 --> 41:45.807
What on Earth?

41:45.807 --> 41:47.679
Where did you--Rossi helped me.

41:47.679 --> 41:49.768
I guess there's a cat rescue
down the street.

41:49.768 --> 41:51.247
Oh!

41:51.247 --> 41:52.771
I thought
you don't like cats?

41:52.771 --> 41:54.468
I, uh...

41:54.468 --> 41:55.774
I don't.

41:55.774 --> 41:59.560
Oh, I know a bribe
when I see one.

41:59.560 --> 42:03.651
And by the way, a rescue pet
is a terrible peace offering,

42:03.651 --> 42:05.435
and if you want me back
at the table,

42:05.435 --> 42:07.786
you're gonna have to take it
one step further.

42:11.267 --> 42:13.313
You asked to see me?

42:13.313 --> 42:14.575
Senator.

42:14.575 --> 42:15.968
There you are.

42:15.968 --> 42:17.839
You arrested my son.

42:17.839 --> 42:22.235
We arrested the lead suspect in
a serial murder investigation.

42:22.235 --> 42:24.890
And you pretended
to be me?

42:24.890 --> 42:29.242
I observed every one
of his rights.

42:29.242 --> 42:32.941
But yes, my interrogation
strategy necessitated

42:32.941 --> 42:35.030
talking to him like...

42:35.030 --> 42:36.989
the woman he hates.

42:39.469 --> 42:41.602
Let me be clear.

42:41.602 --> 42:44.736
You are going to drop all
the charges against Benjamin.

42:44.736 --> 42:48.043
If you don't, I'm going to
contact my esteemed colleagues

42:48.043 --> 42:49.871
on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

42:49.871 --> 42:53.005
You know, the ones who control
the purse-strings of the DOJ.

42:53.005 --> 42:54.484
Is that a threat,
Senator?

42:54.484 --> 42:55.703
It's a promise.

42:55.703 --> 42:57.444
With one phone call,

42:57.444 --> 43:00.316
I can have an entire department
of the FBI removed.

43:00.316 --> 43:04.886
So, you <i>will</i>
drop the charges.

43:04.886 --> 43:10.196
If we are going to let the man
who killed Claire Durham go,

43:10.196 --> 43:13.547
I believe that decision is
up to the Deputy Director.

43:18.770 --> 43:22.164
Emily, for the sake
of the BAU,

43:22.164 --> 43:24.253
I think we should
back off.

43:32.479 --> 43:34.133
Well done.

43:50.062 --> 43:52.368
Thank you.
Don't.

43:52.368 --> 43:53.718
Just go get in the shower

43:53.718 --> 43:56.459
and wash the stench
of that jail off.

43:58.331 --> 44:00.289
Who the hell are you?

44:01.813 --> 44:03.466
It's you.

44:03.466 --> 44:05.555
You know this man?

44:05.555 --> 44:07.949
Your son and I
have a deal.

44:07.949 --> 44:11.257
He calls 911,
I come running.

44:11.257 --> 44:13.346
I've got money.
I'll give you whatever you want.

44:13.346 --> 44:16.697
Oh, he's already
given me everything.

44:16.697 --> 44:18.481
Honey, call him off.

44:21.484 --> 44:23.095
Benjamin.

44:23.095 --> 44:25.184
Please.

44:25.184 --> 44:26.751
I raised you.

44:26.751 --> 44:28.317
I love you.

44:30.232 --> 44:31.930
Say that again.

44:36.586 --> 44:38.501
I love you.

44:39.894 --> 44:42.680
Even now, you're lying.

44:43.855 --> 44:45.291
Okay.

44:45.291 --> 44:47.772
I'm gonna give you
five minutes with her.

44:47.772 --> 44:49.991
The police took my teeth.

44:49.991 --> 44:51.776
You don't need them.

44:51.776 --> 44:53.038
She's your mom.

45:09.707 --> 45:11.665
It's not pretty, is it?

45:13.536 --> 45:15.930
Especially considering
she'd still be alive

45:15.930 --> 45:18.019
if you'd listened to me.

45:18.019 --> 45:20.413
So, Deputy Director,
what's the plan?

45:22.415 --> 45:24.156
The Reeves jet
left the hangar.

45:24.156 --> 45:26.854
I have approval for the FAA
to locate it via GPS.

45:26.854 --> 45:28.769
We should have the location
within the hour.

45:28.769 --> 45:30.249
<i>Now</i> you have approval?

45:30.249 --> 45:31.772
Prentiss,
I'm trying here.

45:31.772 --> 45:33.818
Alvez and Jareau
are already in transit.

45:33.818 --> 45:37.038
If you want to keep your face
out of the headlines tomorrow,

45:37.038 --> 45:39.780
just do one thing.

45:39.780 --> 45:41.129
What?

45:41.129 --> 45:43.218
Stay the hell
out of my way.

45:52.967 --> 45:54.795
Yeah?
You two find anything?

45:54.795 --> 45:57.406
'Cause Reeves
is in the air.

45:57.406 --> 45:59.713
Nice cat. Yeah.

45:59.713 --> 46:02.629
I am very smart,
but the internet is large.

46:02.629 --> 46:04.326
Ugh.
I need more.

46:04.326 --> 46:06.285
What kind of place did Reeves
and Sicarius talk about

46:06.285 --> 46:07.808
for their private forum?

46:07.808 --> 46:10.332
Uh, something they could
hide in plain sight.

46:10.332 --> 46:12.117
Lay over
pre-existing code.

46:12.117 --> 46:13.596
Did they give examples?

46:13.596 --> 46:15.250
Just a place where
you would want

46:15.250 --> 46:16.686
to keep your face
off the internet,

46:16.686 --> 46:19.080
where you can justify
deleting the data.

46:19.080 --> 46:20.778
Like The Beltway Elite.

46:20.778 --> 46:21.996
What's Beltway Elite?

46:21.996 --> 46:24.172
It's the app he used
to find victims,

46:24.172 --> 46:26.131
and it's also where
he talked to Sicarius,

46:26.131 --> 46:28.960
and oh, my goddess,
we found them.

46:28.960 --> 46:32.659
Holy llamas, we found everything
they ever talked about.

46:32.659 --> 46:34.313
Benjamin Reeves' jet
just touched down

46:34.313 --> 46:37.185
at the Municipal Airport
in Whitfield County, Georgia.

46:37.185 --> 46:39.274
That's where he said
the "buried treasure" was.

46:39.274 --> 46:40.580
Something's off.

46:40.580 --> 46:42.321
What-- he should be
flying to Brazil.

46:42.321 --> 46:44.323
Why would he lead us
to more evidence?

46:44.323 --> 46:46.064
You think it's a trap?
No.

46:46.064 --> 46:48.153
I think Benjamin Reeves
is a patsy,

46:48.153 --> 46:50.459
and he's too dumb
to know it.

46:50.459 --> 46:53.158
I'll call JJ and Alvez,
let them know they have company.

47:08.216 --> 47:10.784
It's normal if you need
to throw up.

47:10.784 --> 47:13.395
Finally killed the person
you wanted to kill.

47:13.395 --> 47:15.528
No, I'm good.

47:16.877 --> 47:18.661
I can get us to a country
that doesn't extradite.

47:18.661 --> 47:20.098
We can start over.

47:20.098 --> 47:23.014
Yeah,
we'll get to that in time.

47:23.014 --> 47:25.233
This is the perfect spot.

47:25.233 --> 47:28.193
You're gonna wanna see
what I'm about to do.

47:28.193 --> 47:29.672
We're in.

47:29.672 --> 47:30.891
What do they talk about?

47:30.891 --> 47:33.633
Murder.
Rape. Biting.

47:33.633 --> 47:35.417
If only we had something
to track them--

47:35.417 --> 47:37.289
a name, a bank account, something.

47:37.289 --> 47:38.551
Capture it all.

47:38.551 --> 47:40.074
I'm trying.

47:55.307 --> 47:58.092
What just... They took it all down.

47:58.092 --> 48:00.442
All of it.
How does he know?

48:13.586 --> 48:15.718
We're at the coordinates.
Do you copy?

48:15.718 --> 48:17.068
Atlanta Agent:
<i>Copy that.</i>

48:17.068 --> 48:18.547
<i>Satellite imaging
found two doors</i>

48:18.547 --> 48:20.201
<i>sticking out of the ground.</i>

48:20.201 --> 48:21.899
<i>Backup's on the way.</i>

48:21.899 --> 48:23.639
Copy.

48:26.033 --> 48:28.079
I don't really feel
like waiting.

48:28.079 --> 48:30.037
- You?
- I thought you'd never ask.

48:30.037 --> 48:31.299
Put this on.

48:31.299 --> 48:32.605
Whatever we're walking into,

48:32.605 --> 48:34.563
the team's gonna want
to see it, too.

48:41.048 --> 48:42.963
<i>Hey, it's Will.
Leave a message.</i>

48:42.963 --> 48:45.270
Hey, it's me.

48:45.270 --> 48:48.577
Um, I was just gonna...

48:48.577 --> 48:50.884
say...

48:50.884 --> 48:52.407
I love you.

48:54.453 --> 48:56.063
That's all.

48:56.063 --> 48:58.587
I'll, uh-- I'll talk to you
in a little bit.

48:58.587 --> 49:00.024
Bye.

49:05.725 --> 49:08.815
- You okay?
- Yeah.

49:08.815 --> 49:10.773
Let's go.

49:12.993 --> 49:15.474
Do we have the satellite uplink
to Luke and JJ's body cams?

49:15.474 --> 49:17.215
Just went live.

49:21.828 --> 49:23.482
<i>There they are.</i>

49:23.482 --> 49:26.006
<i>Looks like a storm cellar.</i>

49:26.006 --> 49:28.139
Tell them to proceed
with caution.

49:28.139 --> 49:30.837
They know.

49:30.837 --> 49:32.795
Sir.

49:32.795 --> 49:34.754
Any direction
you'd care to give us?

49:36.756 --> 49:38.236
No.

49:39.585 --> 49:41.195
<i>We're going in.</i>

50:13.010 --> 50:16.404
God, it's just like
the other shipping container.

50:25.935 --> 50:28.199
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

50:28.199 --> 50:30.114
Get out of there now.

50:30.114 --> 50:32.072
JJ, it's a bomb!
Run!

50:32.072 --> 50:34.683
Run, run!

50:37.295 --> 50:40.124
Luke, JJ, come in.

50:43.083 --> 50:45.738
I repeat.
Luke, JJ, come in.

50:47.566 --> 50:50.090
Come in.

50:50.090 --> 50:51.831
Please.

50:56.140 --> 50:57.706
Oh, no.
