00:02.294 --> 00:06.004
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.465 --> 00:09.299
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

00:09.384 --> 00:12.297
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.387 --> 00:14.970
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.557 --> 00:17.389
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

00:17.476 --> 00:20.219
<i>It took everything in my
friends' power to bring me back.</i>

00:20.312 --> 00:23.350
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

00:23.732 --> 00:26.145
<i>And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

00:26.235 --> 00:28.397
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:29.404 --> 00:30.736
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:30.989 --> 00:32.275
Events will align that allow

00:32.366 --> 00:34.232
Team Flash the chance
to discover your identity.

00:34.326 --> 00:35.316
It is of no concern.

00:35.410 --> 00:36.776
I could whip up
a predictive algorithm.

00:36.870 --> 00:37.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

00:37.955 --> 00:40.197
I can run through
my quantum cerebral chip.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.406
We'll find him in no time.

00:41.500 --> 00:44.243
If you've miscalculated
by even a decimal...

00:44.336 --> 00:46.419
There is not a decimal, a fraction,

00:46.505 --> 00:50.590
an infinitesimal variable
beyond my thought!

00:50.759 --> 00:52.716
The name we're looking for
is Clifford DeVoe.

00:52.803 --> 00:56.422
92% match to our psychological
profile. No other DeVoe comes close.

00:56.515 --> 00:57.881
- Can I help you?
- We were just hoping

00:57.975 --> 01:00.342
to talk with Clifford DeVoe.
Is he here?

01:00.435 --> 01:02.518
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How may I be of help?

01:07.276 --> 01:08.858
The effects...

01:10.946 --> 01:13.029
...of Taoism...

01:13.615 --> 01:18.485
All right, class.
Write your essays on

01:19.496 --> 01:20.987
this list of topics.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.494
You have two weeks to complete them.

01:24.126 --> 01:27.039
Does anyone have their notes
from earlier?

01:27.129 --> 01:29.121
I'm afraid I can't read
my own handwriting.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.761
Class dismissed.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.476
I know that look.

01:45.689 --> 01:47.521
I felt the same after my 11:00 a.m.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.726
Introduction to Fluid Mechanics
and Physical Thermodynamics class.

01:51.987 --> 01:55.276
See, I was trying to explain turbulent
flow rates and, ten minutes in,

01:55.365 --> 01:56.697
I wanted to pull my hair out.

01:56.783 --> 01:59.070
It's a good thing I know
water flowing to the axis

01:59.161 --> 02:01.073
of a tube is called...

02:01.163 --> 02:02.324
You better get this right.

02:02.414 --> 02:03.450
Laminar.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.491
- So, you do listen.
- To you, always.

02:07.002 --> 02:11.087
Nothing matters to them if it's
not digestible in YouTube videos

02:11.173 --> 02:14.666
of talking babies
or inane pet tricks.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.761
Have you seen the husky singing
"Like a Virgin?"

02:20.390 --> 02:21.756
I made you smile.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.888
How can we enlighten them
if their minds are too small

02:24.978 --> 02:27.186
to handle the gift
of knowledge anymore?

02:27.814 --> 02:29.055
Well, your plan will work.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.141
We just need to re-fashion
the delivery system.

02:31.526 --> 02:34.485
It's not the plan that's flawed.
It's my ability to execute it.

02:35.197 --> 02:37.439
- Clifford...
- I'm simply not smart enough.

02:37.783 --> 02:40.025
You are the most
brilliant mind I know.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.199
It's not enough.

02:42.746 --> 02:43.827
Not yet.

02:44.873 --> 02:45.863
What?

02:51.755 --> 02:54.088
At this point it's just a concept.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.086
I call this my thinking cap.

02:57.511 --> 03:01.380
Just like their minds have gotten too
small to handle their full capacity,

03:01.473 --> 03:03.135
mine's too small to deliver it.

03:03.225 --> 03:08.892
This can change all that...
If you build it, of course.

03:13.443 --> 03:16.686
Your dream is my dream.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.651
And your passion is my passion.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.701
I'm nothing without you.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.627
I hope it's not too sweet.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.592
- This is amazing.
- Just like my wife.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.753
Somehow she finds time
to take care of me

03:41.847 --> 03:43.713
and still keep
an immaculate household.

03:43.849 --> 03:46.466
And her three-cheese macaroni,
second to none.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.348
Sometimes I think
I'm the luckiest man alive.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.272
Gentlemen, how can I help?

03:54.443 --> 03:58.687
The name "DeVoe" came up
in an investigation of ours.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.777
We would just like to ask you
some questions, if that's okay.

04:01.992 --> 04:03.824
Why him? DeVoe's a common name.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.951
Yes, I'd wager

04:06.163 --> 04:09.076
at least 1,100 individuals,
give or take a few,

04:09.166 --> 04:11.249
with that last name
in the Central City area alone.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.450
The name's been identified

04:12.544 --> 04:15.252
for its connection
to four separate criminal cases.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.750
So, you think my husband is
a witness to these crimes?

04:17.841 --> 04:20.879
No, we'd like to eliminate him
as a suspect.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.837
- You can't be serious.
- It's all right, Marlize.

04:24.389 --> 04:25.755
Do go ahead.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.804
So, Professor,
what brought you to Central City?

04:29.269 --> 04:30.760
I grew up in South Africa.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.770
And after studying history
and econometrics

04:33.857 --> 04:37.066
at the University of Johannesburg,
I took a teaching position at Oxford.

04:37.444 --> 04:38.605
That's where we met.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.647
He swept me off my feet.
We've been together ever since.

04:42.949 --> 04:46.659
It did take a tenured offer
from Central City University

04:46.745 --> 04:48.577
to lure me away
from the Oxford faculty.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.655
That was four years ago.

04:50.749 --> 04:54.743
Question. Do you know Ramsey Deacon?

04:57.839 --> 04:59.046
No. Should I?

04:59.925 --> 05:01.291
What about Becky Sharpe?

05:03.094 --> 05:05.461
- No. I'm afraid not.
- Ralph Dibny?

05:07.098 --> 05:10.091
- Mina Chaytan?
- Mina Chaytan. Yeah.

05:10.185 --> 05:11.175
That name's familiar.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.727
Isn't this the Native-American woman
that left abruptly?

05:13.814 --> 05:15.897
- You know, the anthropologist?
- Yes, I remember.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.731
I was so sad to see her go.

05:17.818 --> 05:21.311
You were colleagues.
Did she mention her work?

05:21.404 --> 05:25.865
No, but Mina was an animated woman.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.821
Then again, people like us,

05:27.911 --> 05:30.574
who see education
as a calling, we often are.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.495
That painting...

05:34.751 --> 05:36.458
It's beautiful.

05:37.629 --> 05:40.372
The samurai,
they were formidable foes.

05:40.465 --> 05:43.754
They'd often make unstoppable enemies
to their opponents.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.423
You wouldn't want to cross one.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.968
So you spent time in Japan?

05:50.600 --> 05:54.014
The feudal history of Medieval Japan,
it's one of my areas of expertise.

05:54.396 --> 05:55.762
Then you must speak the language.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.988
He also speaks French, Italian,
Mandarin, several other languages.

06:06.074 --> 06:09.363
Here's the thing. I love teaching.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.198
It gives me the opportunity
to broaden perspectives.

06:12.289 --> 06:15.248
But you can't just inspire people
to be better.

06:15.333 --> 06:19.327
You somehow need to change
the way people think.

06:19.421 --> 06:24.541
Clifford. My husband is very passionate,
but also needs his rest.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.883
Is there anything else
we can do to help?

06:28.054 --> 06:32.799
No. Thank you. If we have any more
questions, we'll get in contact.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.227
- Barr.
- Yeah.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.610
You know where to find me.

06:56.541 --> 06:59.705
Well? Is it him?

07:08.678 --> 07:11.045
I don't know, Barr.
This shy college professor

07:11.139 --> 07:12.129
who likes mac-and-cheese

07:12.223 --> 07:14.340
doesn't exactly seem like
a criminal mastermind to me.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.050
I mean, come on.
It wouldn't be the first time

07:16.144 --> 07:18.932
somebody played nice, and then
turned out to be our bad guy.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.264
The Council of Wells
gave us his name for a reason.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.520
- They gave us one name out of...
- 1,100.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.693
1,122, to be precise.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.611
He was off by 22.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.279
I mean, isn't that
a little suspicious?

07:29.366 --> 07:30.573
Not if he Googled himself.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.200
I'm just saying there's
something weird about this guy.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.276
He likes samurai.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.242
Who doesn't? Have you seen <i>Zatoichi,</i>

07:37.332 --> 07:38.743
<i>- The Blind Swordsman?
- ...The Blind Swordsman?</i>

07:39.626 --> 07:41.413
- Best Criterion collection.
- Great box set.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.244
- Ever.
- Okay, think about this.

07:43.338 --> 07:45.751
If the Council's right,
that means DeVoe arranged for me

07:45.840 --> 07:47.502
to come out of the Speed Force
exactly where he wanted.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.549
- Even you couldn't do that.
- You have a point.

07:49.844 --> 07:52.257
- Okay, let's cover all our bases.
- Agreed.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.054
Okay, Cisco, Harry, you guys
wanna see what kind of

07:54.140 --> 07:55.927
digital footprint
you can get on this guy.

07:56.393 --> 07:57.759
Caitlin, you've got friends at CCU.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.218
Let's see what kind of person
we're dealing with.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.644
- Will do.
- Dad, CCPD,

08:00.730 --> 08:02.767
- background check.
- On it, sweet one.

08:03.692 --> 08:04.899
And you...

08:06.528 --> 08:08.190
- You all right?
- Yeah.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.271
But thank you for asking.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.570
You know, I think Human Resources

08:13.660 --> 08:16.368
might not be okay with this,
us being co-workers and all...

08:16.454 --> 08:18.366
Yeah. I think they'll let it slide,

08:18.456 --> 08:21.164
considering I get to marry
the co-worker of my dreams

08:21.251 --> 08:22.458
a week from now.

08:23.294 --> 08:24.956
You know, sometimes I feel like...

08:28.842 --> 08:31.209
- Like what?
- Like I'm the luckiest man alive.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.759
<i>Molecular physics,
condensed matter, cosmology,</i>

08:39.852 --> 08:44.439
<i>even relativity, all these fields,
will be revolutionized overnight.</i>

08:55.452 --> 08:57.569
You've infused my design with life.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.112
We still have a problem.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.495
There's currently no way to power
a prototype this sophisticated...

09:03.585 --> 09:04.951
We'll find a solution.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.411
Expanding a mind
to an infinite capacity

09:07.505 --> 09:09.292
requires an expanding energy source.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.048
Where are we going to find
that kind of power?

09:13.011 --> 09:15.253
<i>- Can you tell us how?</i>
- Turn that up.

09:15.346 --> 09:18.054
<i>It'll change the way we think about
science, about quantum mechanics,</i>

09:18.141 --> 09:23.102
<i>about molecular physics. Once
my particle accelerator goes online</i>

09:23.188 --> 09:25.976
<i>it'll blow the doors of science
off their hinges.</i>

09:26.149 --> 09:27.811
<i>That's amazing.</i>

09:27.901 --> 09:31.315
We needed a power source
unlike anything imaginable.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.859
Well... It seems

09:34.949 --> 09:37.817
Harrison Wells just imagined it for us.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.619
<i>Instantly... Change lives.</i>

09:44.167 --> 09:46.705
History moves in cycles.

09:47.253 --> 09:50.246
We must, therefore,
learn from what came before us

09:50.340 --> 09:53.504
in order to carve a path
for what's to come.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.755
Because those who don't learn from...

10:00.809 --> 10:04.348
Because those who don't learn
from history are doomed to repeat it.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.473
Class dismissed.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.475
Don't forget your reading material.
Chapter 11,

10:11.569 --> 10:14.277
on the counter-culture backlash
and its influence

10:14.364 --> 10:16.526
on the Reagan Administration.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.202
Mr. Allen... Twice in one day?

10:22.622 --> 10:24.204
Yeah. I'm sorry to bother you again.

10:24.582 --> 10:27.825
Look, I do have a stack
of mid-term exams...

10:28.002 --> 10:30.335
Yeah, no. I understand you're busy.
This won't take long.

10:30.421 --> 10:31.753
I just wanted to ask...

10:33.508 --> 10:36.876
Where were you four years ago
on the night of January 7th?

10:38.096 --> 10:41.009
Honestly, Mr. Allen, I have no idea.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.429
How far back does this
investigation of yours go?

10:44.686 --> 10:47.303
I'm not at liberty
to discuss that with you.

10:47.814 --> 10:50.727
Also, do you ever use public transit?

10:52.986 --> 10:55.729
What, like the subway?
I mean, imagine me in a wheelchair...

10:55.822 --> 10:57.188
More like a bus.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.608
Is this really necessary?

11:01.077 --> 11:02.534
I'm just being thorough.

11:04.747 --> 11:08.661
Fine. I prefer Lyft.
They're wheelchair friendly.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.499
Honestly, Mr. Allen,
how are my vehicle options important,

11:12.589 --> 11:14.581
or a date I can hardly remember?

11:14.841 --> 11:17.458
I'm just trying to establish
a timeline and solve a mystery.

11:17.594 --> 11:20.302
Mysteries are for novelists
and archaeologists.

11:20.388 --> 11:23.881
You were supposed to be
ruling me out as a suspect.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.676
Instead, it seems like
you've got your guy.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.728
No. This is just procedure.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.309
Feels like persecution.

11:32.650 --> 11:37.520
Now, can I get back to you or do I
need to accompany you downtown?

11:38.823 --> 11:40.985
No, of course not.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.284
Just email me.
And again, I'm sorry to bother you.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.352
So this is an example of meta DNA.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.105
This is the DNA
you brought me from DeVoe.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.689
It's completely normal.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.771
Do you see all the differences?

12:22.700 --> 12:24.066
Clifford DeVoe is not a meta.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.281
Did you two find anything?

12:27.538 --> 12:29.825
Well, he's never been arrested,

12:29.916 --> 12:32.454
he pays all his taxes
and his mortgage,

12:32.543 --> 12:34.660
he has a very reasonable 401k plan.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.371
Donates to the Sierra Club,
volunteers at an orphanage,

12:37.465 --> 12:39.047
is a Big Brother.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.466
Dad didn't find anything either.

12:40.551 --> 12:43.544
He says that he's an
upstanding member of the community.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.421
Yeah, I talked
to some friends at Oxford.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.472
They said DeVoe's
a little absent-minded,

12:47.558 --> 12:48.548
but everybody likes him.

12:48.643 --> 12:52.102
Guys, I'm telling you Clifford DeVoe,
he's not what he seems.

12:52.188 --> 12:55.101
That could just be the wheelchair.
I mean,

12:55.191 --> 12:56.853
- you do kinda have a bad history...
- No!

12:56.943 --> 12:57.933
That wasn't me.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.859
Come on. He's too perfect.

12:59.946 --> 13:03.110
Okay, I just... I've a strong feeling
that he's hiding something.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.190
You don't believe me.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.026
No, it's not that
we don't believe you, Barry.

13:07.120 --> 13:11.239
It's just... Right now,
DeVoe seems like a good guy.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.623
Guys, it's him.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.743
I thought we were done just
assuming people are villains.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.167
All right, you know what? Vibe it.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.071
Oh, my God!

13:49.954 --> 13:51.286
You were right.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.952
That mac-and-cheese
looks unbelievable.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.329
See, that doesn't sound
very villainous, does it?

13:56.419 --> 13:58.832
Barry, can I talk to you outside?

14:01.007 --> 14:03.795
Okay, so do you wanna tell me
what's really bothering you?

14:04.344 --> 14:06.677
My spidey sense is just tingling
way off the charts.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.921
Barry, is there any chance
that this is about the wedding?

14:09.015 --> 14:11.302
- I mean, maybe you're feeling...
- No, I'm not nervous.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.554
But you're not acting
the way that you normally do.

14:13.644 --> 14:17.513
Look, Savitar and Kadabra warned us
about someone named DeVoe.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.433
This DeVoe guy
could be behind everything.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.772
The bus metas. Me coming out
of the Speed Force

14:22.862 --> 14:24.694
at the wrong place. The Samuroid.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.814
Barry, is there a possibility

14:26.908 --> 14:28.820
that you were so determined
to find the bad guy

14:28.910 --> 14:30.242
and get ahead of everything
that you're seeing things

14:30.328 --> 14:31.614
exactly the way you wanna see them?

14:31.704 --> 14:32.911
No, I...

14:34.707 --> 14:36.323
Maybe. I don't know...

14:37.835 --> 14:41.749
Look. In seven days, I am going
to marry the man that I love.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.673
But right now I have to lock down
a new DJ,

14:44.759 --> 14:45.749
because the last one got fired

14:45.843 --> 14:47.084
for drinking too much
and wouldn't stop dancing

14:47.178 --> 14:48.168
with the father of the bride.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.345
Joe might be into that actually.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.388
Which is exactly why
I need to go home.

14:53.434 --> 14:54.891
And I would really like your help.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.443
Ready for the press conference?

15:06.948 --> 15:08.314
Absolutely.

15:09.492 --> 15:10.528
Yeah.

15:14.789 --> 15:15.870
Thank you.

15:15.957 --> 15:20.247
My name is Harrison Wells.
Tonight... The future begins.

15:20.837 --> 15:23.705
The work my team and I will do here

15:23.798 --> 15:25.585
will change our understanding

15:25.675 --> 15:28.839
of physics, will bring about
advancements in power,

15:28.928 --> 15:31.420
advancements in medicine,
it'll bring about advancements.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.847
Period. This is the future.

15:34.851 --> 15:37.810
And trust me, it'll be here
faster than you think.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.305
What does it mean to you?

15:42.442 --> 15:44.729
Hey! My laptop.
It's got my dissertation!

15:47.613 --> 15:49.070
Well, it would appear
tonight's entertainment

15:49.157 --> 15:50.819
is not limited to the stage.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.531
What's the first thing you'll do
once the accelerator is online?

15:54.704 --> 15:57.412
Crack open an expensive bottle
of Dom Perignon with my staff.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.740
I ride them very hard,
and they've earned it. Yes?

15:59.834 --> 16:02.622
Those protesting this accelerator
believe it could

16:02.712 --> 16:05.045
open a black hole in Central City.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.666
But is it not more likely to cause
a benevolent phenomenon

16:08.759 --> 16:10.671
like a Higgs-Boson bridge?

16:10.761 --> 16:13.504
The only phenomenon
that will occur this evening

16:13.598 --> 16:15.965
is one that has been calculated
to the tiniest detail

16:16.058 --> 16:18.266
to the tiniest decimal point.

16:18.853 --> 16:21.140
So you've foreseen
every possible outcome?

16:21.939 --> 16:23.680
Yes, I have, Miss...

16:24.233 --> 16:25.644
Mrs. Marlize DeVoe.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.520
DeVoe...

16:30.907 --> 16:32.114
DeVoe.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.613
I expect that would make the
gentleman to your right

16:34.702 --> 16:35.783
your husband.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.029
Clifford DeVoe.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.995
I'm a big fan of your work.

16:43.503 --> 16:47.292
Sir, I believe it'll have
an enormous impact on our future.

16:48.216 --> 16:51.800
Thank you for coming.
And, Professor... Good luck.

16:57.391 --> 16:58.848
Wells is lying.

16:59.060 --> 17:01.473
He knows
the accelerator won't succeed.

17:02.063 --> 17:03.395
He'd risk an explosion?

17:03.481 --> 17:06.269
No. I think he wants one.
Only the fallout from dark matter

17:06.358 --> 17:07.566
being released into the atmosphere

17:07.652 --> 17:09.894
will produce variants
we cannot yet predict.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.444
We need to delay our plan.

17:11.531 --> 17:14.319
No. This is even better.
We'll have all the power we need.

17:14.407 --> 17:15.773
No, it's too risky.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.569
I'm willing to take the chance.

17:18.663 --> 17:20.746
The blast is the only thing
that can power the cap.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.452
We should wait.
Try and find another way.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.077
This is the only way.

17:28.923 --> 17:35.796
Shut it down! Shut it down!

17:35.972 --> 17:38.760
<i>Shut it down! Shut it down!</i>

17:42.311 --> 17:43.301
Ready, my love?

17:43.938 --> 17:45.270
In position.

17:45.439 --> 17:48.398
Shut it down! Shut it down!

18:01.747 --> 18:02.988
It's starting.

18:28.608 --> 18:29.598
What's happening?

18:35.990 --> 18:36.980
Clifford!

18:46.500 --> 18:47.490
Clifford!

18:49.462 --> 18:50.669
Clifford!

18:52.381 --> 18:53.588
Clifford!

18:58.429 --> 19:02.924
Clifford! No... No, no.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.347
Don't you dare leave me.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.781
I thought I'd lost you.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.162
How do you feel?

19:35.424 --> 19:36.835
Enlightened.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.937
Hey, Allen. Singh wants to see you.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.013
One second.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.395
I don't know, Allen.
Singh's making that face again.

19:54.485 --> 19:55.475
You might wanna hurry.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.150
Trust me, I understand.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.156
- Mr. Allen.
- What's this?

20:03.411 --> 20:04.822
- Close the door, please.
- Yeah.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.239
Continue, Professor.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.747
First my home, then my classroom.
What's next,

20:14.171 --> 20:15.878
our bedroom where we sleep?

20:16.507 --> 20:17.497
Joe and I just wanted...

20:17.591 --> 20:19.628
On behalf of the Central City
Police Department,

20:19.719 --> 20:22.757
I'd like to extend our sincerest
apologies for this intrusion.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.055
Mr. Allen?

20:29.061 --> 20:31.303
Yeah, I'm sorry
for disturbing you, Mr. DeVoe.

20:31.564 --> 20:32.680
Professor DeVoe.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.060
Thank you for coming in.

20:43.534 --> 20:44.866
What the hell were they doing here?

20:44.952 --> 20:46.739
They just filed
a complaint against you.

20:47.371 --> 20:48.361
Said you harassed them.

20:48.456 --> 20:49.697
No, I wasn't harassing them.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.156
Why are you bothering them at all?

20:52.001 --> 20:53.162
It's a case we're working on.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.242
What case?

20:54.336 --> 20:56.669
- It's something that...
- Do me a favor.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.876
Stay away from the nice professor
and his wife.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.333
Captain, DeVoe seems very...

21:01.427 --> 21:02.417
Very what?

21:03.012 --> 21:06.005
And unless the answer is
"guilty of a very specific crime,"

21:06.098 --> 21:07.885
you are way off base.

21:08.517 --> 21:09.928
So are you, Joe.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.934
You should know better than that.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.854
We don't just show up at someone's
house and start asking questions.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.556
We follow protocol.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.451
Anybody home?

21:36.420 --> 21:37.410
Hey.

21:37.713 --> 21:40.672
Hi. Dad said
you were having a bad day, so...

21:40.758 --> 21:43.466
What? No. I'm fine. I'm great,
actually. How are you doing?

21:47.139 --> 21:48.175
What?

21:49.058 --> 21:50.174
What are you...

21:58.526 --> 21:59.607
What is this?

22:00.277 --> 22:03.111
His wife, Iris. She's helping him.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.192
No, listen. Okay, look.

22:05.282 --> 22:08.525
She's not Susie Homemaker with her
perfect mac-and-cheese,

22:08.619 --> 22:11.532
she's a Stepford wife.
She's got two doctorates, you know?

22:11.622 --> 22:14.490
One in mechanical engineering
and another in advanced robotics.

22:14.583 --> 22:15.699
That's how they work.

22:15.793 --> 22:17.910
He comes up with the plans,
but she executes them.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.710
She's some kind of mechanical genius.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.626
So you think DeVoe
and his wife are super-villains?

22:22.800 --> 22:24.666
- Yes.
- Listen to yourself, Barry.

22:24.760 --> 22:25.750
What?

22:25.845 --> 22:27.882
DeVoe's already filed
a complaint against you.

22:27.972 --> 22:29.338
I know, I...

22:29.431 --> 22:33.846
Look. Cisco, Harry,
my Dad, Caitlin...

22:34.019 --> 22:37.228
They're the best and they have
found nothing on DeVoe.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.272
We're getting married
in a week, Barry.

22:41.652 --> 22:46.067
Please, for the sake
of your job and my sanity,

22:46.490 --> 22:48.607
please, let it go.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.380
I've solved them.

23:05.759 --> 23:06.966
Solved what?

23:07.303 --> 23:11.047
Riemann's Hypothesis,
Hilbert's Fifteenth Problem.

23:11.223 --> 23:15.263
The Standard Conjectures on Algebraic
Cycles, and the list goes on.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.682
Clifford, this is incredible.

23:19.481 --> 23:20.642
Ask me anything.

23:21.942 --> 23:23.478
Who was Jack the Ripper?

23:23.861 --> 23:26.103
The prevailing theory
is there was a London barber

23:26.196 --> 23:28.609
by the name Aaron Kosminski
who committed the crimes.

23:28.699 --> 23:31.783
He also suffered schizophrenic
and delusional tendencies.

23:33.662 --> 23:34.778
But...

23:35.456 --> 23:39.826
It was his nurse at the Colney Hatch
Asylum, Catherine Jewell.

23:40.794 --> 23:42.410
It's like every little bit

23:42.504 --> 23:44.666
of knowledge now
resides inside my brain.

23:44.798 --> 23:47.040
I know every answer
to every question ever asked.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.796
You're incredible.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.002
We're incredible.

23:50.471 --> 23:51.837
You made all this possible.

23:52.056 --> 23:54.673
We now finally have
the means to bring to the world...

23:55.684 --> 23:58.927
Clifford, are you okay? Clifford.

23:59.188 --> 24:02.522
Clifford... Clifford.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.170
What are you hiding, DeVoe?

26:29.296 --> 26:31.504
Imagine your body is a river.

26:32.174 --> 26:33.881
There's a dam blocking your legs.

26:33.967 --> 26:37.426
My gastrocnemius muscles
are degenerating, aren't they?

26:37.846 --> 26:39.303
Well, yes.

26:39.932 --> 26:43.391
- The symptoms are similar to...
- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

26:43.644 --> 26:47.979
But your muscles are decaying faster
and more rapidly than typical ALS.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.183
I believe this is something else.

26:51.401 --> 26:54.189
Is that your medical diagnosis?
That I have a case of something else?

26:54.571 --> 26:57.689
It's just, we've never seen
a case like yours before.

27:02.371 --> 27:04.613
An increase in complex
fasciculation potential

27:04.706 --> 27:08.040
explains the axonal membrane
hyperexcitability, but it doesn't...

27:09.837 --> 27:10.953
Of course.

27:11.588 --> 27:13.875
When gamma wave activity
exceeds 50 hertz,

27:13.966 --> 27:17.130
my acetylcholine receptors draw away
from my nerve receptors

27:18.345 --> 27:19.631
instead of toward them.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.217
What did you say
you're a professor of?

27:22.808 --> 27:24.049
History.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.846
What's his prognosis?

27:27.521 --> 27:31.356
Life expectancy for typical ALS
is about two to five years.

27:31.441 --> 27:33.728
In this chrono dispersion,
it'll be half that.

27:35.112 --> 27:37.570
Complete paralysis will come first.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.651
Excuse us, please.

27:45.455 --> 27:46.616
This doesn't make sense.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.453
My mind is drawing energy
from my body.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.415
Like a parasite feeding
on an ailing host.

27:54.631 --> 27:57.499
We're so close to everything
we've ever dreamed of,

27:58.051 --> 28:00.008
only for it to be ripped away
by this body.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.927
No, no, no...

28:02.639 --> 28:06.223
We can stop this, Clifford.
I'll never give up.

28:07.102 --> 28:09.640
2,600 individuals
developed the meta gene

28:09.730 --> 28:13.349
and they use it to rob jewelry stores
and summon tornadoes.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.059
I use mine to save humanity
and I'm condemned?

28:18.655 --> 28:20.396
Dying wasn't part of our plan.

28:27.372 --> 28:30.115
Guys, I found a camera
in the Samuroid head.

28:30.292 --> 28:31.408
Where did it lead back to?

28:31.501 --> 28:32.742
Where do you think?

28:32.836 --> 28:33.952
DeVoe.

28:34.046 --> 28:37.084
So, you pinged the camera to his
computer's IP address? Good.

28:37.174 --> 28:39.632
Well, no, I didn't ping it.

28:40.135 --> 28:41.876
Well, then, how did you
figure out it was him?

28:41.970 --> 28:43.506
- Well...
- This camera isn't even active.

28:43.931 --> 28:45.297
No. I heard it.
It was making a noise.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.551
- Noise?
- Yeah.

28:46.642 --> 28:48.304
Inside the Samuroid head.

28:48.393 --> 28:50.726
It was buzzing and then
I found that thing inside.

28:50.812 --> 28:52.348
He's been watching us for weeks.

28:52.439 --> 28:54.772
And I could've proved it,
but his wife came back too soon.

28:56.151 --> 28:58.108
Too soon? From where?

28:58.320 --> 28:59.936
- I don't...
- Barry...

29:00.280 --> 29:02.237
Tell me you did not
break into their house.

29:02.950 --> 29:04.031
Well...

29:04.326 --> 29:05.533
- Wow, okay.
- No.

29:05.619 --> 29:07.576
Guys... No, that sounds bad.

29:07.663 --> 29:09.871
You have to listen to me.
This guy wants us to think

29:09.957 --> 29:12.199
he's unassuming and weak.
But he's not.

29:12.292 --> 29:13.703
He's powerful and smart.

29:13.794 --> 29:15.330
And he's been ahead of us
every step of the way.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.707
- He's ahead of us right now.
- Easy, Allen. Calm down.

29:17.798 --> 29:19.084
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

29:19.174 --> 29:21.712
Hey. We just don't want you to do
anything else you'll regret.

29:21.802 --> 29:23.213
Anything else?
What do you mean? What have I done?

29:23.553 --> 29:25.545
For starters, breaking and entering.

29:25.639 --> 29:28.347
Oh, my God! I don't understand
why you don't see what's going on.

29:28.475 --> 29:31.468
He probably has cameras everywhere.
At the lab, at CCPD.

29:31.561 --> 29:33.644
I mean, he's always watching us.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.932
Hey, Joe. What is it?

29:39.653 --> 29:41.815
- Hey, I found something.
- Barr, stop.

29:42.072 --> 29:44.439
I just don't feel safe anymore,
you know?

29:45.284 --> 29:47.776
I mean, I thought the police
were supposed to protect people.

29:50.247 --> 29:51.533
I haven't done anything to you.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.285
You broke into our home.

29:58.922 --> 30:01.539
We're good people.
We don't deserve this.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.792
I don't want you to worry anymore.

30:03.969 --> 30:07.258
Mr. Allen will stop all of this
immediately, I assure you.

30:16.273 --> 30:17.809
Stay away from us.

30:23.488 --> 30:24.899
I told you to stay away
from those people.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.109
Captain, you have to listen to me...

30:26.199 --> 30:28.316
You're taking two weeks off.
And that is not a request.

30:28.410 --> 30:29.696
You're suspending me?

30:29.953 --> 30:31.660
You're lucky I'm not arresting you.

30:35.125 --> 30:37.583
Use your time away to consider
your future in law enforcement.

30:55.729 --> 30:58.016
- What is this?
- A restraining order.

30:59.107 --> 31:01.645
I have to stay 500 feet away
from Clifford DeVoe.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.396
And are you going to?

31:06.531 --> 31:07.521
Barry.

31:09.034 --> 31:12.027
This is not you. You've gotta stop.

31:12.162 --> 31:13.994
- I can't.
- You can't or you won't?

31:14.081 --> 31:15.492
I don't know anymore.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.533
I've faced a lot of bad guys.

31:18.835 --> 31:21.202
People that would hurt
the ones that I love,

31:21.463 --> 31:24.206
destroy everything good in the world,
and think nothing of it.

31:24.299 --> 31:28.634
But this guy, he feels more dangerous
than all the others combined.

31:29.137 --> 31:31.470
And we still barely know
anything about him.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.514
It scares the hell out of me, Iris.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.217
Barry, how many times have we been
up against the unknown?

31:36.395 --> 31:38.352
- This is different.
- How?

31:42.776 --> 31:45.143
Ever since I came back
from the Speed Force,

31:45.237 --> 31:49.402
I have been constantly
and genuinely happy.

31:50.617 --> 31:54.486
My friends are safe.
Joe is going to be a dad again.

31:55.664 --> 31:58.372
And, next week, I get to
marry the love of my life.

32:00.210 --> 32:03.248
I have more to lose now
than ever before.

32:05.966 --> 32:09.710
Yeah, but... What about
after Cecile has the baby?

32:11.430 --> 32:13.422
Or after we get married? Or...

32:14.182 --> 32:16.048
Even when we have our first child?

32:18.145 --> 32:21.934
You know, as time goes by, there's
gonna be even more for us to lose.

32:22.482 --> 32:24.815
And people are always
gonna be coming after us.

32:25.735 --> 32:27.192
You can't let that consume you.

32:27.279 --> 32:30.522
You just have to live in the moment
and face it as it comes.

32:31.867 --> 32:33.483
How are you not scared?

32:39.749 --> 32:41.365
Because we're the Flash.

33:11.156 --> 33:15.196
Clifford? Clifford. Clifford.

33:15.285 --> 33:16.742
Get away from me.

33:17.579 --> 33:19.036
I'm trying to help you.

33:19.664 --> 33:23.578
If you really wish to help, construct
a temporal vortex distortion chamber

33:23.668 --> 33:26.581
and prevent me from ever
becoming this atrocity.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.003
This is what we wanted.

33:28.089 --> 33:31.503
I cannot grab a damn book
from the shelf!

33:43.730 --> 33:45.392
What am I, Marlize?

33:47.317 --> 33:49.400
You are my husband.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.565
Your husband is gone.

33:53.073 --> 33:54.234
No.

33:55.992 --> 33:57.278
Let me die.

34:20.976 --> 34:22.592
I'm not going anywhere.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.848
This body will expire.

34:30.610 --> 34:33.569
It will last longer with this.

34:51.672 --> 34:54.666
You are in violation
of a restraining order, Mr. Allen.

34:55.969 --> 34:58.507
Well, you could call the cops.

34:59.973 --> 35:01.589
Do you intend to harm me?

35:03.101 --> 35:04.592
Then pray, do tell,

35:04.686 --> 35:07.599
what is so paramount
that you'd risk incarceration?

35:08.356 --> 35:10.518
I wanted to look you
in the eyes and ask...

35:13.570 --> 35:14.902
Who are you, really?

35:30.503 --> 35:31.869
Who's asking?

35:33.381 --> 35:34.872
Barry Allen...

35:37.886 --> 35:39.343
Or the Flash?

35:40.388 --> 35:42.220
- How did you...
- Oh, please.

35:43.350 --> 35:46.343
Your little secret was one
of the more underwhelming revelations

35:46.436 --> 35:47.643
I have uncovered.

35:48.605 --> 35:52.440
I was born the same evening you were,
January 7th.

35:52.525 --> 35:55.438
The night S.T.A.R. Labs'
particle accelerator

35:55.528 --> 35:58.896
bathed Central City
in gene-altering dark matter.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.194
We were both struck by lightning.

36:01.284 --> 36:02.866
I knew you were affected.

36:04.079 --> 36:06.116
How did our tests
not show your meta DNA?

36:06.206 --> 36:08.323
For such a fast man,
you're rather slow.

36:08.625 --> 36:09.741
I'm smarter than you.

36:11.086 --> 36:13.703
You and your "science team"

36:14.297 --> 36:18.086
have devised no strategy, no action,
no coordinated effort

36:18.176 --> 36:20.418
for which I'm not already prepared.

36:20.720 --> 36:21.801
The Samuroid.

36:22.931 --> 36:25.890
The bus metas. It was you.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.467
But why reveal yourself now?

36:29.145 --> 36:31.728
Because I have nothing
to fear from you.

36:32.065 --> 36:35.103
Yeah? I'd think twice about that.

36:35.819 --> 36:38.311
I have a team of some
of the smartest minds from across

36:38.405 --> 36:39.771
- the multiverse.
- Yes.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.730
Your Council of Wells.

36:43.034 --> 36:46.869
Could any one of those clowns
identify what my abilities are?

36:48.790 --> 36:51.658
You could gather every genius
on every planet

36:51.751 --> 36:54.209
and you still couldn't out-think me.

36:55.255 --> 36:57.713
Plenty of metas have come after me,

36:58.007 --> 37:01.125
the people that I love. You know
the one thing they have in common?

37:02.345 --> 37:03.381
They failed.

37:03.888 --> 37:06.050
You've done wonders all these years

37:06.141 --> 37:08.599
punching gorillas
with rudimentary powers.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.101
Chasing mad men shooting icicles.

37:11.521 --> 37:16.562
Those were children with
play guns. Savitar. Zoom. Thawne.

37:17.026 --> 37:22.146
Their powers are nothing compared
to the power of limitless thought.

37:23.992 --> 37:25.358
That's your ability.

37:26.703 --> 37:29.446
Your intellect was amplified
by the particle accelerator.

37:29.831 --> 37:32.619
You may be
the fastest man alive, Allen,

37:32.917 --> 37:34.453
I'm the fastest mind.

37:40.800 --> 37:44.009
So this is how we begin whatever
twisted game you have planned.

37:47.098 --> 37:50.557
No, Mr. Allen. You've already lost
and you never even realized it.

37:53.396 --> 37:56.264
Congratulations on
your upcoming nuptials.

37:58.026 --> 37:59.437
I'll be thinking of you.

38:07.452 --> 38:08.988
There is something
I need to tell you.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.327
I confronted DeVoe.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.739
Oh, come on! Barry,
he could get you arrested.

38:12.832 --> 38:14.198
No. He won't. He wanted me to come.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.282
How do you know?

38:15.376 --> 38:17.208
Well, for starters,
he knows I'm the Flash.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.623
So, you were right all along.

38:22.509 --> 38:23.670
We didn't believe you.

38:23.760 --> 38:24.750
I'm sorry.

38:24.844 --> 38:27.257
Don't be.
DeVoe's been playing all of us.

38:27.555 --> 38:28.591
How?

38:28.973 --> 38:30.930
It's his powers. He has

38:31.184 --> 38:33.346
an intelligence beyond anything
we could have imagined.

38:33.603 --> 38:35.970
He's orchestrated everything
that we've encountered.

38:36.189 --> 38:37.555
He's moved us like chess pieces

38:37.649 --> 38:39.185
in a game we didn't even know
we were playing.

38:39.442 --> 38:41.684
How do we stop someone
who has super intelligence?

38:41.778 --> 38:43.235
We're pretty smart.

38:43.530 --> 38:44.520
Maybe we're not.

38:54.457 --> 38:55.447
The Thinker.

38:55.708 --> 38:58.416
It's good. Apt sense of menace.
Nailed it in one.

38:58.711 --> 39:00.498
Guys, it's gonna take all of us
to stop him.

39:01.798 --> 39:04.085
Sounds like y'all could use a hand.

39:05.927 --> 39:07.418
Wally!

39:08.888 --> 39:11.005
- Good to see you, Son.
- You, too.

39:12.517 --> 39:13.758
How was Blue Valley?

39:15.436 --> 39:19.100
Self-reflection and a battle
with a starfish from outer space

39:19.607 --> 39:21.064
gives you perspective.

39:21.234 --> 39:22.645
So you found
what you were looking for?

39:22.944 --> 39:24.401
I don't know, to be honest.

39:25.405 --> 39:27.738
Well, we are glad you're home.

39:28.950 --> 39:30.691
Looks like you found
the guy behind the bus metas.

39:30.785 --> 39:31.821
Yeah.

39:31.911 --> 39:34.824
So, you wanna suit up, take him down?

39:34.914 --> 39:37.327
No. Now, it's his move.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.868
But I think we take our time.
Formulate a plan.

39:42.630 --> 39:43.962
What now, boss lady?

39:46.426 --> 39:47.633
We get married.

39:50.013 --> 39:52.630
He came to you.
Just like you said he would.

39:52.724 --> 39:56.092
He's finally seized control
of his fear.

39:57.770 --> 40:01.559
He drew his strength
from those he calls "friends."

40:02.692 --> 40:04.024
Sounds like you admire him.

40:04.527 --> 40:09.192
It is fascinating. In the chain
of 4,900 possible events I predicted,

40:09.282 --> 40:12.241
there was one which resulted
in them calling me "The Teacher."

40:14.704 --> 40:16.411
I prefer "The Thinker."

40:17.624 --> 40:20.617
They will be the first to experience
the enlightenment.

40:22.503 --> 40:24.210
You've been unplugged for too long.

40:28.593 --> 40:30.334
I'm nothing without you.

40:37.894 --> 40:39.010
Proceed.

41:19.769 --> 41:22.762
Your body's deteriorating faster
than the chair can handle.

41:22.855 --> 41:24.596
It will survive long enough.

41:27.318 --> 41:29.105
You're really gonna let them
get married?

41:30.530 --> 41:33.193
What is knowledge without love?
