It's Yacht Day.
I hooked this  up.

I need to tell Jen.

00:24.241 --> 00:25.827
Your call has been forwarded.

00:25.896 --> 00:28.206
There's a whole Instagram
account of us in the club.

00:28.275 --> 00:30.034
She's, like,
not answering her phone,

00:30.103 --> 00:32.103
and he's wondering why.
But now we know why.

00:32.172 --> 00:35.413
There's videos of you grinding
on a girl with, like...

00:35.482 --> 00:38.965

The Situation

This might not have been
the best idea.

We're so classy now.

When Ronnie hears
there are videos of him

grinding with the French girl,
Ronnie's face drops.

01:23.172 --> 01:25.551
I mean, he is trying
to run away from this,

01:25.620 --> 01:28.068

Hello, Lauren?
It's Ronnie.

01:42.655 --> 01:43.655
Hey.

01:43.724 --> 01:46.206
What is exactly,
like, out there?

01:46.275 --> 01:49.862
All right, the only thing
I saw so far is video

01:49.931 --> 01:53.793
of you in the club
dancing with a blonde girl.

01:53.862 --> 01:55.862
Grinding? Or just like dancing,
like just--

01:55.931 --> 01:57.413
No, you're actually,
like,

01:57.482 --> 01:59.310
twirling her dancing.
Like...

01:59.379 --> 02:00.931
I'm like, I'm, what?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.551
You're, like,
twirling her.

02:02.620 --> 02:04.172
Like, you're
holding her hand,

02:04.241 --> 02:05.517
and then, like,
you twirl her around...

02:05.586 --> 02:07.275
Oh, twirling her.
Like, yeah, salsa dancing.

02:07.344 --> 02:08.758
There was Spanish music.

02:10.172 --> 02:12.241
It wasn't like her grinding
on my dick or, like,

02:12.310 --> 02:13.275
anything like that,
right?

02:13.344 --> 02:15.034
No, it wasn't that.

02:15.103 --> 02:17.310
But she was, like,
in a see-through outfit.

02:17.379 --> 02:18.586
Well, that's her fault.

02:18.655 --> 02:20.000
I didn't tell her
to  wear that.

02:21.241 --> 02:22.896
No one told her to come out
in Saran wrap.

02:22.965 --> 02:25.793
We were just dancing. Yeah.

02:25.862 --> 02:27.724
Thank you, Lauren,
you're the best. Here's Mike.

02:27.793 --> 02:29.310
You're welcome.
All right, thanks.

02:29.379 --> 02:31.896
Thank you, brother.

02:31.965 --> 02:34.310
So it's not even
that bad.

02:34.379 --> 02:35.586
It's literally...

02:35.655 --> 02:37.068
Yeah, but picture
her point of view.

02:37.137 --> 02:38.310
Bro, it's me twirling,
dancing.

02:38.379 --> 02:39.551
I know, but--

02:39.620 --> 02:42.241
Now the Instagram police
are gonna tag her

02:42.310 --> 02:44.000
in every single
thing and be like,

02:44.068 --> 02:45.517
"Look what he's doing!"Well, if she was a grown-up

02:45.586 --> 02:47.517
and she'd
let me explain myself

02:47.586 --> 02:50.724
and tell her the whole
situation, the whole scenario--

02:50.793 --> 02:51.965
Right, but she's not
allowing you to do that.

02:52.034 --> 02:53.793
Exactly. So she's
building it all up

02:53.862 --> 02:56.379
in her head of me
twirling a girl?

02:56.448 --> 02:58.517
It's not like the girl
was grinding on me.

02:58.586 --> 03:00.586
You know, she was
bent over, yeah. Then--

03:00.655 --> 03:02.793
I'm not gonna lie, though,
that did happen.

03:02.862 --> 03:04.758
I don't know if you
don't remember or what,

03:04.827 --> 03:06.137
but she was
grinding on you.

03:06.206 --> 03:07.724
When?
When?

03:07.793 --> 03:09.655
In the corner,
the whole time.

03:09.724 --> 03:11.034
What're you talking about?

03:11.103 --> 03:14.517
I was salsa dancing
with her. Like, it's...

03:14.586 --> 03:17.000
I don't know where you learn
salsa like that.

03:17.068 --> 03:19.413
I don't know if like, that's,
like, a salsa he saw in

03:19.482 --> 03:22.413
like a porn once or something?
But, anyway...

03:22.482 --> 03:25.137
Bro, the girl was
grinding on you.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.482
It was more
than just...

03:26.551 --> 03:28.275
I was standing on the top
of the thing, bro.

03:28.344 --> 03:30.931
Yo, it looks so bad 'cause
that girl had to have no bra on.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.310
Exactly.
That made it even worse.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.137
But I didn't do anything.
Yes, you did.

03:35.206 --> 03:37.379
No, I didn't.You did something.

03:37.448 --> 03:39.586
Shut the  up, Vin.

03:39.655 --> 03:42.448
Dude, like, you were in
the Jacuzzi too with girls.

03:42.517 --> 03:45.965
Like, don't sit here and act
like I was the only one.

03:46.034 --> 03:47.724
Just shut your  mouth.

03:47.793 --> 03:49.517
I'm letting you know
what you did.

03:49.586 --> 03:51.241
What did I do?
'Cause you keep s--
Bro...

03:51.310 --> 03:52.551
you were
in the bathroom with her

03:52.620 --> 03:54.241
and this and that.

03:54.310 --> 03:56.379
I'm sorry.I was giving her a tour
of the house.

03:56.448 --> 03:57.655
Oh, my God...

03:57.724 --> 03:59.827
I was being a nice,
hospitable person.

03:59.896 --> 04:01.655
Yo, you shouldn't
be going

04:01.724 --> 04:04.034
into another room, closing
the door behind you...

04:04.103 --> 04:07.862
I did not close the door.
And you know what?

04:07.931 --> 04:09.137
I didn't know that
the  door

04:09.206 --> 04:11.689
had an "automatic closer"
out of nowhere.

04:11.758 --> 04:13.482
So the  door shut,

04:13.551 --> 04:16.896
so it looked worse than
what it really was.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.482
I did not shut the door.

04:18.551 --> 04:19.896
Ronnie denies that
it actually happened.

04:19.965 --> 04:21.655
He's like, deny, deny, deny.

04:21.724 --> 04:24.172
Hope this door works.

04:26.896 --> 04:28.931
But, bro, you can't deny
that .

04:29.000 --> 04:32.068
Vin, the door closed. Like...Really?

04:32.137 --> 04:33.896
Yes.That's weird.

04:33.965 --> 04:35.310
Must've been a draft
up in there.

04:35.379 --> 04:36.689
I had it open,
then all of a sudden

04:36.758 --> 04:38.172
the door just went...

04:38.241 --> 04:41.517
and it shut. And then
that's when Pauly was like...

04:43.000 --> 04:44.655
Dude.

04:45.655 --> 04:47.241
I can see you, brother.

04:47.310 --> 04:50.896
Okay. Okay. Well, at le--
at least you caught it,

04:50.965 --> 04:53.275
you know what I mean? But...Obviously.

04:53.344 --> 04:55.620
The question is,
what is the chances

04:55.689 --> 04:57.862
of survival here?

04:57.931 --> 04:59.103
Well, here's the thing.
I just think it needs

04:59.172 --> 05:00.931
to blow over. She's not
gonna pick up the phone

05:01.000 --> 05:02.379
maybe today, maybe tomorrow,
maybe the next day.

05:02.448 --> 05:04.689
But when she does,
he can explain himself.

05:04.758 --> 05:06.655
You just gotta tell
your side of the story.

05:06.724 --> 05:08.448
You also need to take
responsibility

05:08.517 --> 05:10.689
for your own actions
and behavior, as well.I'm trying to.

05:10.758 --> 05:12.758
She's not picking up
the  phone.
Okay.

05:14.068 --> 05:15.620
The good news is,
it's just a twirling thing.

05:15.689 --> 05:17.310
She should definitely
take your call for that.

05:17.379 --> 05:19.344
But I'm letting you know,
in the grand scheme of things,

05:19.413 --> 05:21.482
you were flirting with the line
a little more with that girl,

05:21.551 --> 05:23.586

eventually see.

I feel like a new woman.

32:34.448 --> 32:36.965
The real issue here is that

32:37.034 --> 32:39.827
he cheated on her
inside our house.

32:39.896 --> 32:41.034
We didn't see it.

32:41.103 --> 32:43.068
He could have got
a blowie.

32:43.137 --> 32:45.724
They could have kissed.
He could have did a finger.

32:45.793 --> 32:47.896
He could have honked
on the tatas.

32:47.965 --> 32:50.379
It doesn't matter if he
literally said, "I did nothing."

32:50.448 --> 32:52.551
You shut the door.
You did everything.

32:52.620 --> 32:55.413
Why every relationship that
he's in, it's toxic, though?

32:55.482 --> 32:58.586
I don't know why all of Ronnie's
relationships turn toxic.

32:58.655 --> 33:01.103
Maybe it's actually just him.
When you tell a girl, hey,

33:01.172 --> 33:03.655
I want to be in a relationship,
but then you cheat and lie,

33:03.724 --> 33:05.000
they turn toxic.

33:05.068 --> 33:06.448
'Cause girls don't play.

prepare for what's gonna happen,

That's what I've been saying.Dead honest.

33:23.275 --> 33:24.620
Like, I mean that.
People say it,

33:24.689 --> 33:25.965
but no, I mean that.
Yeah.

33:26.034 --> 33:27.931
Like, everything I do,
I do it for her.
Right.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.586
A baby's gonna change your life.

33:29.655 --> 33:33.517
Ronnie needs to focus on that
a bit more then focusing on Jen.

33:33.586 --> 33:36.655
That relationship does not need
to happen in order for him

33:36.724 --> 33:39.068
to be the most amazing
father in the world.

33:39.137 --> 33:40.620
And I can teach Ronnie that.

33:40.689 --> 33:42.310
Don't force yourself
into a relationship

33:42.379 --> 33:43.827
that you're not going
to be happy in.

33:43.896 --> 33:46.000
If you end up with
your baby mama, yes,
that would be ideal.

33:46.068 --> 33:47.689
At the very least,
you should have

33:47.758 --> 33:49.620
a co-parenting relationship
with this woman.

33:49.689 --> 33:52.034
Mine was so rocky
in the beginning,
it was nuts.

33:52.103 --> 33:53.344
But we got over it,
and now this is

33:53.413 --> 33:54.689
the best thing that
ever happened to me.

33:54.758 --> 33:55.896
And I think
that can happen with you.

33:55.965 --> 33:57.931
Yeah. 'Preciate it.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.448
Yeah, no doubt.
That's the word.Yeah.

33:59.517 --> 34:01.517
Everyone else in the house
has their little perfect,

34:01.586 --> 34:03.965
you know, white picket fence,
and they're married,

34:04.034 --> 34:05.827
and they have their kids
and their house

34:05.896 --> 34:07.137
and their families,
and they're happy.

34:07.206 --> 34:10.482
And it's like
I can't really relate to them.

34:10.551 --> 34:12.379
So the only person I could
really relate to is Pauly,

34:12.448 --> 34:13.965
because he's been through it.

34:14.034 --> 34:18.241
He's turned  situation
into an amazing situation,

34:18.310 --> 34:21.310
and, so, like, that's the person
that I can relate to the most.

34:21.379 --> 34:23.482
Listen, taking relationship
advice from me sounds crazy,

34:23.551 --> 34:24.827
but that I do know, yeah.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.655
You're smart.
You're the one that learned

34:26.724 --> 34:28.551
about relationships
by not being in them.

34:28.620 --> 34:29.862
Yeah.
You know,
other people learn

34:29.931 --> 34:31.413
about being in
a bunch of bad ones.

34:31.482 --> 34:32.586
You know what I mean?
It's like--Yeah.

34:32.655 --> 34:33.758
I learn what I do
and don't want

34:33.827 --> 34:35.241
from other people's
relationships.

34:35.310 --> 34:36.586
So that's why I--You're welcome.

34:36.655 --> 34:38.275
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Exactly. Thank you!

34:40.689 --> 34:42.862
After that relationship,
I didn't, I didn't want one.

34:42.931 --> 34:47.689
So Ronnie's only told Jen
what happened that night,

34:47.758 --> 34:50.034
like, leading up to the house
and nothing after?

34:50.103 --> 34:54.689
I believe he brought up
about the-- him bringing

34:54.758 --> 34:57.586

find out regardless.

gonna tell her. Can you?

after a breakup.

36:52.413 --> 36:54.379
When you're meeting
your ex's girl,

36:54.448 --> 36:56.068
you gotta look better than her,
you know what I'm saying?

36:56.137 --> 36:58.206
You gotta look extra.
So we're gonna make Sammi

36:58.275 --> 37:00.793
look extra today
to show out in front of Jen.

37:00.862 --> 37:03.551
Sammi, you look great.
Except for your eye.

37:03.620 --> 37:05.068
We can't let her
go out like that.

37:05.137 --> 37:06.689
You want to pop this one
on for a freshie?

37:06.758 --> 37:08.206
Damn, bro.

37:08.275 --> 37:09.413
Oh!

37:10.586 --> 37:12.310
What the...

37:12.379 --> 37:15.586
Yo, toss me one, homey.
Oh!

37:15.655 --> 37:17.862
We got a new head?Yeah.

37:17.931 --> 37:21.689
Who the frig travels,

37:21.758 --> 37:24.862

for a doll?

37:24.931 --> 37:27.172
Like, what goes on
in this house?

37:27.241 --> 37:29.206
Damn, she looks different.

37:29.275 --> 37:31.517
Well, all the other girls in
the house have new faces anyway.

37:31.586 --> 37:34.275
Facts. Facts.So she's gonna fit in.
It's perfect.

37:34.344 --> 37:36.620
Come on, Sammi.On the couch?

37:36.689 --> 37:37.827
Yeah.

37:37.896 --> 37:39.482
Look at how pretty Sam looks.

37:39.551 --> 37:41.344
If I was Jen
coming into this house,

37:41.413 --> 37:43.965
I would not want
to be staring at

37:44.034 --> 37:47.275
my boyfriend's ex-girlfriend
at the dinner table.

37:47.344 --> 37:49.482
Doll or not.
Like, that's so weird.

37:49.551 --> 37:50.758
Oh, my God,
that's perfect.You know what?

37:50.827 --> 37:53.103
She looks great.She's waving hi to Jen.

37:54.517 --> 37:56.172
Do you want me
to pour you a glass?

37:56.241 --> 37:58.206
That would be great,
thank you.Surely, girlfriend.

37:58.275 --> 37:59.551
Oh! Okay thanks.

37:59.620 --> 38:02.137
I'm, like, a heavy pourer.

38:02.206 --> 38:06.206
I'm so curious to see how Ron
acts around Jen in front of us.

38:06.275 --> 38:07.896
He talks a lot of  here.

38:07.965 --> 38:10.034
And I'm like, does he talk
this  in front of her?

38:10.103 --> 38:11.551
Like, does she just take it?

38:11.620 --> 38:13.931
What goes on
in their relationship?

38:16.689 --> 38:18.586
Ron, why you breathing
like James Gandolfini?

38:20.206 --> 38:22.413
Just getting closer
and closer to Jen getting here

38:22.482 --> 38:23.931
and I'm nervous
as  right now.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.758
There's so many things
that could actually go wrong.

38:25.827 --> 38:28.137
I'm like, ah, what the
did I get myself into?

38:28.206 --> 38:30.793
You're stressing me.

38:30.862 --> 38:32.310
He's nervous, bro.
His wifey's is gonna come.

38:32.379 --> 38:34.103
I'm nervous.
No, I'm nervousHe's nervous.

38:34.172 --> 38:35.379
I think we're all nervous.

38:35.448 --> 38:36.931
Sam's not nervous,
she got all dolled up.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.068
Oh, hell yeah.
If I was in Ronnie's shoes,

38:39.137 --> 38:41.862
I would definitely be nervous
because I already  up.

38:41.931 --> 38:43.137
Now my girl's coming.

38:43.206 --> 38:45.413
What happens if someone
says something?

38:45.482 --> 38:47.931
Hopefully  doesn't
come out inadvertently.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.379
Ooh, French fries,
who's those for?

38:50.448 --> 38:52.068
♪♪

38:56.206 --> 38:58.172
Okay, I'm gonna go
sit with Sam.

38:59.551 --> 39:01.482
I'm gonna get ready.
All right.

39:05.344 --> 39:08.000
That's a little concerning.

39:08.068 --> 39:10.827
Mike and Ron have been
going at it, like, every day.

39:10.896 --> 39:14.275
And I feel like it's not
gonna stop when she's here.

39:14.344 --> 39:17.724
So, I think Ron's just worried
for the fact that,

39:17.793 --> 39:20.413
yo, if I go at Mike,
he might come back at me

39:20.482 --> 39:21.793
talking about French fries.

39:24.034 --> 39:26.310
This is gonna be a disaster.

39:26.379 --> 39:28.172
So I'm excited
to meet this girl.

39:28.241 --> 39:29.896
I wish Ron would have
told her about that night.

39:29.965 --> 39:33.137
If he was going to tell her,
it was gonna be told already.

39:33.206 --> 39:35.827
So now he's going
to be telling her, um,

39:35.896 --> 39:37.655
when he gets home
from the vacation.

39:37.724 --> 39:39.103
I think that's
a terrible idea, but...

39:39.172 --> 39:42.275
Now she's here.Mike.

39:42.344 --> 39:44.275
Oh, Mike's gonna
do it too.

39:44.344 --> 39:45.724
He's the worst.You think?

39:45.793 --> 39:48.068
I don't know,
to be honest with you.

39:48.137 --> 39:51.206
I feel like it's gonna be next,
like a wild next could days.

39:51.275 --> 39:52.482
Yeah.

39:55.206 --> 39:56.482
♪♪

39:56.551 --> 39:57.620
I need a drink.

39:57.689 --> 39:59.482
Don't be nervous, bro.

39:59.551 --> 40:02.482
Ron, just sit down
and relax.

40:02.551 --> 40:04.482
I'll just be relaxing. Yeah.

Bro, shut the  up.

40:22.655 --> 40:25.241
Let me handle it
when I'm gonna handle it.

40:25.310 --> 40:27.724
I'm not doing it in the house

40:32.620 --> 40:35.620
Old Situation is out

40:35.689 --> 40:38.310
I see a little old Situation
with Mike right now.

40:38.379 --> 40:39.551
And I'm just,
like, waiting

40:39.620 --> 40:41.758
for, like,
a ticking bomb to explode.

40:41.827 --> 40:43.620
Something's gonna
go down.

40:43.689 --> 40:45.586

chattering]

Okay, okay, okay.Shh, shh, shh!

Hi, it's Mike.
Ron likes French fries.

40:49.551 --> 40:51.517
No? I won't do that.

40:52.896 --> 40:55.517
Come on.I hate all of you.

40:55.586 --> 40:57.172
Ron doesn't have boundaries.

40:57.241 --> 41:00.172
So if Mike slips up
in the French fry way,

41:00.241 --> 41:02.275
Ron will just physically
destroy him.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.413
Ohhh!

41:06.482 --> 41:07.655
Oh, my God.
