00:00.367 --> 00:01.701
[Khloé] <i>Previously on…</i>

00:01.768 --> 00:04.170
You have children. You don't need
our permission, but you need to tell us.

00:04.237 --> 00:06.706
I've already talked to all my kids
and told you what I was going through.

00:06.773 --> 00:11.244
My sisters and I knew
that Bruce was a cross-dresser,

00:11.311 --> 00:15.148
<i>but we were never told
that he was gonna fully transition</i>

00:15.215 --> 00:16.950
and become a woman.

00:17.550 --> 00:20.553
Since I can remember,
my gender identity was always an issue.

00:20.620 --> 00:24.024
They call this process "transitioning".

00:24.090 --> 00:27.660
I totally respect that it's difficult,
but I also was blindsided by this.

00:27.727 --> 00:30.563
-Do you have a time frame?
-Probably in the spring.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.832
I don't think it's fair
that you don't tell us.

00:32.899 --> 00:34.934
[Kendall] <i>He is one
of the greatest people I know,</i>

00:35.001 --> 00:37.203
so to think of someone giving him hate

00:37.270 --> 00:39.339
is more of a worry to me
than anything else.

00:41.107 --> 00:44.344
I am just so proud of all of you.
I got to deal with myself.

00:44.411 --> 00:48.014
[Bruce] The last thing in the world
I wanna do is hurt any one of you.

00:48.081 --> 00:50.784
There's just…
There's no right way to do this.

00:50.850 --> 00:53.920
[dramatic music]

00:55.055 --> 00:57.057
[waves lapping]

00:57.123 --> 00:59.159
[birds squawking]

01:01.995 --> 01:03.396
[Bruce] Thank you.

01:03.463 --> 01:06.666
Out of everything I've done in my life,
raised wonderful children,

01:06.733 --> 01:09.702
um, worked hard, been successful.

01:09.769 --> 01:13.873
Um, out of all these things in my life,
maybe in God's eyes, this is my calling.

01:13.940 --> 01:17.377
We don't want anyone to live their life
and feel like they're in the wrong body

01:17.444 --> 01:19.612
or they're completely
just unhappy in their soul.

01:19.679 --> 01:22.916
I am okay with what's happening,
I just need a moment to, like…

01:22.982 --> 01:24.417
I have to transition as well.

01:24.484 --> 01:27.020
-Yeah.
-So when you talk about transitioning,

01:27.087 --> 01:29.389
and you said you're going to do
the few things to your face.

01:29.456 --> 01:30.290
Right.

01:30.356 --> 01:35.195
Then, from that point on,
do you start just, every day you are…

01:35.261 --> 01:37.197
I think it would be hard
after you do enough stuff,

01:37.263 --> 01:39.065
it gets harder and harder
to play the other side.

01:39.132 --> 01:40.600
But, like, do you have to just pick a day?

01:40.667 --> 01:43.136
Like, "This is the day
I'm gonna just wear this stuff.

01:43.203 --> 01:46.106
-I'm not gonna wear boxers anymore."
-I am gonna just play it by ear.

01:46.172 --> 01:47.107
Okay.

01:47.173 --> 01:49.676
So, like, you don't have
a surgery to remove that,

01:49.742 --> 01:51.711
and then that means you're the woman.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.546
-Uh, remove?
-Remove your…

01:53.613 --> 01:56.483
Oh, the little thing down there?
That's kind of the last thing you can do.

01:56.549 --> 01:58.051
You can do an awful lot before that.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.420
So, like, do you have
an appointment to do that?

02:00.487 --> 02:02.822
-No. As of right now, no.
-[Kim] 'Kay.

02:02.889 --> 02:04.190
I only have one more appointment.

02:04.257 --> 02:06.526
So after that last appointment,
with the face,

02:06.593 --> 02:09.062
here and here,
you consider yourself a woman?

02:09.128 --> 02:11.731
-I think… Yeah, if I'm comfortable.
-If it gets in the way, you'll…

02:11.798 --> 02:14.734
I'm not planning on, like, dating
or doing any of that. That's nothing--

02:14.801 --> 02:17.203
-And when you date women?
-I don't know what I would do.

02:17.270 --> 02:19.139
-[Bruce] I haven't been there yet.
-[chuckles]

02:19.205 --> 02:21.941
[Kim] Just… My mom literally
has not asked this at all,

02:22.008 --> 02:23.710
-but I'm just curious.
-Go.

02:23.776 --> 02:25.812
So if your life was living a lie as Bruce,

02:25.879 --> 02:28.848
and you would have sex
with my mom, were you, like, into it,

02:28.915 --> 02:31.417
or were you, like,
grossed out, like, were you…

02:32.352 --> 02:34.821
-[Kim] You know, like…
-No, I'm totally heterosexual.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.557
But if you're a "woman",
then were you a lesbian?

02:38.158 --> 02:39.526
[hums in wonder]

02:39.592 --> 02:41.928
You're not attracted to men,
you're attracted to women.

02:42.662 --> 02:45.198
Yeah, as a guy, I was always
attracted to women, yeah.

02:45.265 --> 02:48.234
Maybe what he's saying when he,
like, fully transforms into a girl,

02:48.301 --> 02:50.470
-it might, like, feel different.
-[Bruce] I don't… Yeah.

02:50.537 --> 02:52.906
-Yeah, I think it'd be very different.
-[Kim] 'Kay.

02:52.972 --> 02:55.275
-And I'm not doing this…
-[Khloé] Yeah.

02:55.341 --> 02:56.576
…for that reason, not at all.

02:56.643 --> 02:58.378
[Bruce] But who knows?

02:58.444 --> 02:59.512
[serious music]

02:59.579 --> 03:02.081
I think we're just gonna follow
Bruce's lead through all of this,

03:02.148 --> 03:05.485
and whatever he wants,
we will support him.

03:05.552 --> 03:07.487
All right, do we have any more questions?

03:07.554 --> 03:10.123
When do we start
referring to you as "her"?

03:10.190 --> 03:11.958
You will see me and you will know.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.195
Okay, so as of now,
when we see Bruce, you're just Dad Bruce.

03:15.261 --> 03:16.529
[Bruce] Yeah. Yeah, Dad, Bruce.

03:16.596 --> 03:20.200
I'm always gonna be your dad,
no matter what I go through.

03:20.266 --> 03:22.202
-[Kendall] We should call you Mad.
-Yeah, Mad.

03:22.268 --> 03:24.037
Mom and Dad,
and you're a little bit crazy.

03:24.103 --> 03:25.905
-A little crazy, yeah.
-[Kendall] Mad.

03:25.972 --> 03:27.373
[laughs]

03:27.440 --> 03:32.178
We haven't met her yet. We don't know
who Bruce is when he is a woman.

03:32.245 --> 03:36.749
I think now I'm okay and confident
and comfortable enough to meet her.

03:36.816 --> 03:39.452
I think he would be okay if we met.

03:39.519 --> 03:42.922
[bright music]

03:46.326 --> 03:47.660
[car door opens]

03:47.727 --> 03:50.029
-[Scott] Yello.
-[Bruce] Need your wheels done?

03:50.830 --> 03:52.699
Yeah, I'll take a little Armor All
if you got it.

03:52.765 --> 03:54.100
Well, actually, that's what I got.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.802
[Scott] <i>I realize Bruce is not
my biological father</i>

03:55.868 --> 03:56.936
or even my stepfather,

03:57.003 --> 03:58.738
but I know him a long time
and I care for him,

03:58.805 --> 04:01.507
and it was difficult to hear
he was going through something.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.109
<i>I just want him to be happy.</i>

04:04.944 --> 04:06.613
-All right, what do you need to know?
-Well…

04:06.679 --> 04:09.716
-Give me your list of questions.
-I got a lot.

04:09.782 --> 04:12.118
[suspenseful music]

04:13.987 --> 04:15.855
-All right, what do you need to know?
-Well…

04:15.922 --> 04:18.691
-Give me your list of questions.
-I got a lot.

04:18.758 --> 04:21.127
You know, nobody,
in the past ten years of knowing you,

04:21.194 --> 04:24.130
has ever, <i>ever</i> told me anything.

04:25.031 --> 04:27.333
I just assumed Scott knew.

04:28.001 --> 04:30.603
I kept telling Kourtney, "There's no way
he doesn't know. There's no way."

04:30.670 --> 04:33.139
Khloé kept telling me,
"Scott knows. He's gotta know.

04:33.206 --> 04:35.341
Come on, he definitely knows
what's going on."

04:35.408 --> 04:36.976
I was like, "No, he does not."

04:37.043 --> 04:40.580
Kim, Khloé, Kourtney, Kendall, Kylie, Rob,
I mean, everyone knew but me.

04:40.647 --> 04:44.717
And I kept trying to explain
to him that I never told anybody.

04:44.784 --> 04:45.818
I'm not mad at him,

04:45.885 --> 04:47.720
because I know it's hard
for him to tell anybody

04:47.787 --> 04:49.122
what he was going through,

04:49.188 --> 04:51.457
but I just wish I would've known sooner
and could've been there for him.

04:51.524 --> 04:53.793
[Bruce] My whole life,
I haven't been honest with myself,

04:53.860 --> 04:56.829
I haven't been honest with my kids.

04:56.896 --> 04:59.365
It's been the big secret
that nobody can talk about.

04:59.432 --> 05:03.936
I felt like, for so many years, you know,
me and you had like a big disconnect,

05:04.003 --> 05:05.905
and if I would've had any idea

05:05.972 --> 05:07.940
of some of the things
that you were struggling with,

05:08.007 --> 05:09.575
I wouldn't have been so insecure

05:09.642 --> 05:11.878
about why we couldn't get along properly
sometimes, you know what I mean.

05:11.944 --> 05:14.914
Yeah, you're right. I don't think
the two of us have been that close.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.684
-[Bruce] Where do you wanna start?
-I mean, I guess it's just like…

05:18.351 --> 05:20.019
[Scott] I mean, just like
the little things.

05:20.086 --> 05:21.888
Are you gonna be like
the butchiest girl ever

05:21.954 --> 05:26.359
with like, still wanna, like--
You're into so many guy sports, like.

05:26.426 --> 05:27.760
Uh, I will still have a good time.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.529
Why would I wanna give up
all the fun stuff?

05:29.595 --> 05:32.031
Like, do you see yourself
going to the golf course?

05:32.098 --> 05:33.966
I'm going through an awful lot
just to get to the ladies' tees.

05:34.033 --> 05:36.936
Right. Was it frustrating to be around
all these women when you couldn't

05:37.003 --> 05:38.871
-be a woman?
-Yes. That was tough.

05:38.938 --> 05:40.006
[Scott] I mean, everybody's over here.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.641
-They're always having girls' nights.
-Right. You're like--

05:41.708 --> 05:43.976
They're always having--
Yeah, and I can't do all of that.

05:44.043 --> 05:45.712
-Right. And that's--
-[Bruce] And can you imagine the pressure

05:45.778 --> 05:47.680
of having to get dressed
for all these girls?

05:47.747 --> 05:50.350
-Yeah.
-Yeah, that'd be a tough deal.

05:50.416 --> 05:53.152
It's pretty wild that you're
gonna live two lives in one lifetime.

05:53.219 --> 05:54.654
I mean, not many people
can say they did it,

05:54.721 --> 05:56.689
which is pretty extraordinary
in some ways.

05:56.756 --> 05:59.625
Yeah, it is. Yeah.
Kind of groundbreaking in a lot of ways.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.961
-[Scott] Now, do you--
-Um, there is a lot of momentum

06:02.028 --> 06:04.030
in the transgender community,
they've come a long way recently.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.265
-Will you help out in that community?
-Oh, I would love to. Yeah.

06:06.332 --> 06:10.002
Obviously, you're an amazing speaker,
so I'm sure you could do a lot of good.

06:10.069 --> 06:12.071
-[Bruce] Yeah.
-And help a lot of people who want

06:12.138 --> 06:14.006
to be able to come out
and say this that can't.

06:14.073 --> 06:17.577
Bruce is gonna open the door
for so many people

06:17.643 --> 06:20.279
that are finally gonna be able to live
their life the way they want to.

06:20.346 --> 06:21.981
I mean, you're talking about

06:23.082 --> 06:26.853
the biggest male athlete,
maybe of our time…

06:28.321 --> 06:32.725
who is known as the man's man
turning into a lady.

06:33.326 --> 06:37.430
For anybody who's going through this
and thinks that it's impossible,

06:37.497 --> 06:40.299
well, here it is right in front
of your face, it's not.

06:40.366 --> 06:42.335
What are some of your, like, worries?

06:42.402 --> 06:45.538
I mean, I know living in L.A. is one
of the worst places ever with media,

06:45.605 --> 06:46.439
so that's scary.

06:46.506 --> 06:47.974
Then every time you leave
your house for the first year…

06:48.040 --> 06:49.008
They're out there right now.

06:49.075 --> 06:52.412
But I'm saying, in a few months,
it's gonna be torture for a year.

06:52.478 --> 06:55.548
I was honestly thinking
about getting out of Malibu

06:55.615 --> 06:58.684
and, you know, moving up in the hills
of Santa Barbara or…

06:58.751 --> 07:01.220
-Then that's, like, running again, right?
-And then I'm running again, number one.

07:01.287 --> 07:02.655
Number two, this is my home.

07:02.722 --> 07:04.657
Right. You shouldn't have
to leave to be yourself.

07:04.724 --> 07:09.295
And I'm hoping that we've
kinda turned the corner there.

07:09.362 --> 07:12.365
Yeah, I mean, I think you know already
there's gonna be so much negativity,

07:12.432 --> 07:14.434
-and then positivity will come.
-Yeah, yeah.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.569
I mean, are you
getting anxious and excited?

07:16.636 --> 07:17.904
-Oh, of course.
-I mean, it must be like--

07:17.970 --> 07:20.039
-It's gonna be a great year.
-Right. I mean, it must be like

07:20.106 --> 07:22.074
-your coming out party, right?
-Freeing! Yeah.

07:22.141 --> 07:25.978
You know, for me, I'm just excited
to see him be nice and be happy.

07:26.045 --> 07:27.947
I mean, it was
very obvious for a long time

07:28.014 --> 07:29.849
that he was living
with some kind of secret.

07:29.916 --> 07:32.285
Sometimes, I thought
it was something about me, and…

07:33.085 --> 07:35.288
You know, I've realized
that I'm probably just perfect,

07:35.354 --> 07:37.356
and it's everybody else around me
that's got issues.

07:38.958 --> 07:42.061
It's so overwhelmingly nice
for me to be able to see you

07:42.128 --> 07:44.497
just feel comfortable and be happy.

07:44.564 --> 07:47.533
I mean, I just didn't know what the hell
was wrong with you all the time.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.368
-You were just so [bleep] pissed.
-[chuckles]

07:51.871 --> 07:53.840
[waves crashing]

07:55.475 --> 07:57.310
-[sneezes]
-[Khloé] Oh!

07:57.376 --> 08:00.012
You sound like Minnie Mouse
was getting attacked.

08:00.079 --> 08:03.015
-Um, Dad is coming over.
-[Khloé] Mm-hmm.

08:03.082 --> 08:06.285
'Cause he wants to apologize to you.
And I want you to be nice to him.

08:06.352 --> 08:08.020
I've never not been nice to Dad.

08:08.087 --> 08:11.123
I know, but you need to understand
that this is, like, a moment for him.

08:11.190 --> 08:12.358
-Probably not an easy one, so--
-A 100%, so you can't--

08:12.425 --> 08:14.594
-I'm upset that…
-You don't need to be so harsh.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.463
…he's transitioning and wasn't telling us.

08:17.530 --> 08:19.298
You don't need to be so hard on him.

08:19.365 --> 08:22.268
He's coming here to, like,
fix that and apologize.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.337
-And I don't think--
-I agree I was really upset.

08:24.403 --> 08:25.972
[Khloé] Like, there's no way to prepare

08:26.038 --> 08:27.807
for, like, what we were talking about
or what we were doing.

08:27.874 --> 08:28.841
-Yeah.
-And I--

08:28.908 --> 08:31.577
I mean, I've never been
through something like that before.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.614
Yeah, my reaction was aggressive,

08:34.680 --> 08:37.183
but I was more mad that he
was proceeding with something

08:37.250 --> 08:38.951
but telling us something
completely different

08:39.018 --> 08:41.687
-until we cornered him.
-Yeah.

08:41.754 --> 08:46.058
I'm sure going your whole life,
keeping this big secret from your kids

08:46.125 --> 08:49.095
<i>and, like, practically
everyone you know is a lot.</i>

08:49.161 --> 08:51.063
And to, like, all of a sudden,
one day be like,

08:51.130 --> 08:52.665
<i>"All right, I'm gonna tell
every single one of my kids.</i>

08:52.732 --> 08:55.067
<i>I think it's hard to, like,
tell them every little bit."</i>

08:55.134 --> 08:58.004
So, I'm sure it's, like, not easy
to just spill everything at once.

08:58.070 --> 09:01.307
So maybe, withholding information
is just a natural thing.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.842
-[Bruce] Hola!
-Hi, Dad.

09:02.909 --> 09:04.610
-[Bruce] Kendall, you're up!
-[Kendall] Yeah.

09:04.677 --> 09:06.746
[tense music]

09:06.812 --> 09:10.316
[serious music]

09:11.217 --> 09:12.084
Are you okay?

09:13.085 --> 09:14.287
Yeah. I'm okay.

09:14.353 --> 09:18.124
I'm not mad at your process of you
wanting to live your life. I'm not.

09:18.190 --> 09:22.828
What I was mad about
is feeling like you were robbing me

09:22.895 --> 09:26.065
of, like, having the opportunity
to, like, let go on my own.

09:26.132 --> 09:29.135
[Khloé] When you're doing, like,
your big serious surgery,

09:29.201 --> 09:31.804
you can't just do that,
and then I come over one day

09:31.871 --> 09:33.239
-and Bruce is gone.
-True.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.974
Like, you can't just take
that away from us.

09:35.041 --> 09:36.576
And that's what I was mad about.

09:36.642 --> 09:39.679
It's not that you're doing it.
I'm mad that you weren't telling us.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.747
I know you're very emotional about this.

09:41.814 --> 09:44.450
You've had a lot of losses
in your life, you know.

09:44.517 --> 09:48.821
Um, and in a way, this is kinda like
somewhat of a, you know,

09:48.888 --> 09:51.691
like a death in the family,
or things really drastically change.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.025
-[Khloé] Mm-hmm.
-I get that.

09:53.092 --> 09:54.560
I know it's not malicious.
I know you're not trying to be--

09:54.627 --> 09:57.063
No, it's not. It's tough
to talk to you because you are…

09:57.830 --> 10:00.600
probably taking this
the hardest of anybody.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.835
The last thing in the world
I wanna do is hurt anybody.

10:02.902 --> 10:04.704
-Mm-hmm. And I know that.
-Okay?

10:04.770 --> 10:06.238
Especially you, Kendall,
everybody in the family.

10:06.305 --> 10:08.040
I don't wanna hurt anybody. I just…

10:08.107 --> 10:10.309
-Um, I have to also live my life.
-[Khloé] Yeah.

10:10.376 --> 10:12.878
And, uh, sometimes,

10:13.779 --> 10:16.515
because of my love for you
and my feelings for you,

10:16.582 --> 10:18.084
I don't wanna hurt you.

10:18.150 --> 10:19.318
-Mm-hmm.
-And so I apologize

10:19.385 --> 10:22.488
-for not being as honest as I should be.
-Well, thank you.

10:22.555 --> 10:24.690
[light music]

10:24.757 --> 10:26.759
[breathes deeply]

10:28.060 --> 10:31.697
You know, for the last,
I don't know, 50 years,

10:31.764 --> 10:33.866
I've always lived my life
for everybody else.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.705
[Bruce] <i>Playing the role
that they want me to play.</i>

10:42.274 --> 10:45.244
<i>At a point in life, you get to,
"Who should we make happy here?</i>

10:45.311 --> 10:47.146
Who should I live my life for?

10:47.980 --> 10:50.316
Should I live my life
for all these wonderful people?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.655
Or should I live my life for myself?"

10:58.124 --> 11:01.460
We also wanna be a part of your life.
We want to be there.

11:01.527 --> 11:03.829
And this is a journey for you,
and we want to support you.

11:03.896 --> 11:05.798
[Khloé] I'm sure this
is very emotional for you,

11:05.865 --> 11:08.768
but you should be able to share that
with your family, you know.

11:10.369 --> 11:13.105
I want Bruce to be happy.
We are not gonna treat you differently.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.807
We're gonna love you.
You're still our dad.

11:15.474 --> 11:19.211
We're obsessed with you. You've been
a [bleep] incredible father to all of us.

11:19.278 --> 11:22.581
You know, your support is,
and Kendall's, and everybody in the family

11:22.648 --> 11:24.417
is extraordinarily important.

11:24.483 --> 11:27.119
[Bruce] There's nothing
like freeing your soul,

11:27.186 --> 11:30.556
um, and surrounding yourself with people
that make you feel good about yourself.

11:31.223 --> 11:33.993
And I love you guys dearly.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.928
And like I was just saying
to Kendall before you got here

11:35.995 --> 11:37.229
that I've never been through this before.

11:37.296 --> 11:39.165
So I don't know, like,
how you're supposed to react.

11:39.231 --> 11:42.001
-Yeah. No, I get that.
-Don't think I'm not supporting you.

11:42.068 --> 11:44.670
I'm just trying to figure out
how to handle everybody in the family,

11:44.737 --> 11:46.739
and sometimes, it's--
There's a lot of personalities.

11:46.806 --> 11:50.142
-Yeah. For sure.
-Right now, I'm, uh…

11:52.178 --> 11:55.614
-I'm very optimistic about the future.
-Good.

11:55.681 --> 11:58.084
And I haven't felt that way
in a long, long time.

11:58.150 --> 11:59.051
That's good.

11:59.118 --> 12:01.454
Because I think,
going through all of this,

12:01.520 --> 12:03.723
I will come out the other side
a much better person.

12:04.690 --> 12:08.894
A much more understanding person.
And I feel like I can help people.

12:08.961 --> 12:11.063
-I can do some good. You know?
-Mm-hmm.

12:11.130 --> 12:12.832
[Bruce] <i>The transgender issue right now</i>

12:12.898 --> 12:17.303
is kind of where the gay issue
was 30, 40 years ago.

12:17.369 --> 12:19.071
<i>A lot of people don't understand it,</i>

12:19.138 --> 12:22.341
and what we need is tolerance
towards that community.

12:23.142 --> 12:26.245
Because of the situation I'm in, uh,
I think we can do a lot of good.

12:26.979 --> 12:28.914
-You know what I did this morning?
-Hmm?

12:28.981 --> 12:29.915
I talked to my mother.

12:29.982 --> 12:32.985
-You told her for the first time?
-Yup.

12:33.052 --> 12:34.253
Does she understand you?

12:34.987 --> 12:37.623
Yup, and she's been online researching
and learning everything

12:37.690 --> 12:39.692
-all day long. She was…
-Oh, that's good.

12:39.759 --> 12:43.429
-…um, extremely supportive.
-Good.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.631
Yeah, I was a little scared to talk
to her, but she's 88 years old,

12:45.698 --> 12:49.401
and, um, we haven't been
that close my whole life.

12:49.468 --> 12:51.303
So I started off by saying, you know,

12:51.370 --> 12:54.273
"I'm gonna tell you, talk to you
about some things that I'm going through

12:54.340 --> 12:56.976
that will probably bring us
a lot closer together.

12:57.042 --> 12:58.844
You know, so you
can understand me better."

12:58.911 --> 13:00.212
And she loved that, you know.

13:00.279 --> 13:03.549
And she says, "Oh, my god, thank you
for sharing this with me," and on and on.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.017
And she was just, uh, she was great.

13:05.084 --> 13:06.085
-I love you.
-We know.

13:06.152 --> 13:08.053
But that's good you told
your mom. I love you too.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.456
-Love you, love you, love you, love you.
-[Kendall] Love you.

13:11.891 --> 13:14.693
I wanna be supportive of Bruce.
I never wanna hurt his feelings.

13:14.760 --> 13:17.296
[Khloé] <i>I've always been Team Bruce.</i>

13:20.099 --> 13:22.802
[gentle music]

13:22.868 --> 13:25.271
[mumbles]

13:25.337 --> 13:26.939
What are you up to, sir?

13:27.006 --> 13:29.742
[Khloé] Mase, you are so freaking cute,
I can't handle it.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.444
-[Scott] How old are you, anyway?
-I'm five.

13:32.511 --> 13:34.747
Let me show you
what you were like as a little baby.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.783
I just said to Melissa,
"Oh, we went to this therapist.

13:37.850 --> 13:40.853
Um, you know, to talk
about, like, the Bruce thing,"

13:40.920 --> 13:43.022
-and Jesse goes--
-What? You just spring it on her?

13:43.088 --> 13:46.525
-Jesse goes, "Oh, so that's true?"
-And then I said, "Yeah." And I was like--

13:46.592 --> 13:48.594
Kourtney, you're the worst
to tell anybody anything.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.762
That's how you told someone?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.931
She didn't tell me the whole time
I knew her. You had to tell me.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.699
Even when he shaved his Adam's apple down,

13:53.766 --> 13:55.901
-I still was so naive.
-Who knew that was an option

13:55.968 --> 13:57.002
that you could shave that down?

13:57.069 --> 13:59.405
I still didn't know.
I just thought he wanted a slimmer neck.

13:59.471 --> 14:02.007
I literally never even dreamt of thinking
that he was gonna transition.

14:02.074 --> 14:04.109
Don't talk too much about it
in front of Mason.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.044
What?

14:05.110 --> 14:08.514
Um, I just don't wanna talk
about it in front of Mason yet.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.683
No, me neither.
But he's gonna come to an age

14:10.749 --> 14:12.518
and he's gonna start asking questions,
and he's gonna say,

14:12.585 --> 14:14.420
"Whatever happened to that grandpa I had?"

14:14.486 --> 14:16.422
[Scott] <i>Kourtney and I
have definitely talked</i>

14:16.488 --> 14:18.390
<i>about how we're
gonna explain this to Mason,</i>

14:18.457 --> 14:24.163
and it's only a positive for my son
and my daughter to know

14:24.230 --> 14:26.799
all these different things
that go on in this world.

14:26.866 --> 14:30.035
You can do whatever you want, I mean,
as long as you become happy with yourself,

14:30.102 --> 14:31.270
that's all that really matters and…

14:31.337 --> 14:33.873
Like I said, I mean, you only
really get one chance at this life,

14:33.939 --> 14:36.442
so whatever you got to do
to be happy, you got to do it.

14:36.508 --> 14:38.444
Did you guys hear what happened
to Kendall last night?

14:38.510 --> 14:39.879
-What happened to Ken?
-[Khloé] You, guys, so Kendall--

14:39.945 --> 14:42.514
Um, Kendall was at a comedy show,
she goes every Wednesday.

14:42.581 --> 14:44.683
So they were, like,
"Hey, Kendall, da-da-da."

14:44.750 --> 14:46.919
Um, whatever, he was talking
to her, like, on the stage,

14:46.986 --> 14:49.622
like, so everyone hears.
There was like 200 to 300 people in here.

14:49.688 --> 14:52.258
And this girl from the audience goes,
"Ask her about her dad!"

14:52.324 --> 14:53.659
-[Scott] Oh, man.
-And screamed.

14:53.726 --> 14:54.894
And he was like, "What about your dad?"

14:54.960 --> 14:58.163
And she just shook her head, and she was,
like, with her friend, she was like, "No."

14:58.230 --> 15:00.499
The bad news and the good news is,
that is gonna happen a lot.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.034
Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.070
-Right, he's gonna hear something.
-Someone's gonna say something.

15:05.137 --> 15:10.743
I think we are waiting to see
what Bruce does before we tell Mason.

15:10.809 --> 15:12.645
I definitely don't want him to find out,

15:12.711 --> 15:15.648
you know, through someone
at school or something like that.

15:15.714 --> 15:18.217
I want him to find out through us.

15:18.284 --> 15:19.685
And I think just…

15:19.752 --> 15:24.256
It's such a great lesson to, you know,
teach him not to judge people.

15:24.323 --> 15:26.525
It's a great life lesson

15:26.592 --> 15:31.730
that, you know, I think I have
to make it the most positive that I can.

15:31.797 --> 15:33.165
[Khloé] What did the therapist say?

15:33.966 --> 15:37.603
She told you that he's way more aware
than what you think.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.204
Oh, I know that.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.273
[Kourtney] This guy's a genius right here.

15:41.340 --> 15:44.476
-[laughs]
-[squeals]

15:51.317 --> 15:53.752
[door opens, closes]

15:55.154 --> 15:56.155
-[pans clank]
-Here I am.

15:56.221 --> 15:57.556
-There you are.
-[Bruce] I made it.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.791
[Kris] What are you doing?

15:58.857 --> 16:01.026
I don't know. I just wanted
to talk to you about this,

16:01.093 --> 16:02.728
the whole thing that's going on.

16:02.795 --> 16:03.963
Yeah?

16:04.029 --> 16:05.931
'Cause I feel like…

16:07.132 --> 16:09.101
I'm trying to be honest with everybody.

16:10.002 --> 16:14.807
And it seems I've talked more to the kids,
and you've been kind of on the outside.

16:15.374 --> 16:18.610
And I hear all these rumors
from the kids, "Oh, Mom's upset,"

16:18.677 --> 16:22.548
and this and that, and I don't want that
to happen, so I thought I would come over.

16:22.614 --> 16:25.084
-And sit down and talk. Let's sit down.
-[Kris] All right.

16:25.150 --> 16:28.320
[serious music]

16:29.188 --> 16:31.023
I was thinking about this all day.

16:31.090 --> 16:33.625
[Bruce] I wrote down notes
to make sure I hit all the points.

16:33.692 --> 16:35.861
'Cause I didn't wanna walk away,
and then on the drive home, thinking,

16:35.928 --> 16:38.664
"Okay, you forgot to say this,"
or "You forgot to say that."

16:38.731 --> 16:39.665
[paper crinkles]

16:39.732 --> 16:43.002
[serious music]

16:46.071 --> 16:47.639
[crinkles]

16:47.706 --> 16:49.541
First of all…
[exhales]

16:49.608 --> 16:52.077
-[Bruce] You're an amazing woman.
-[sniffles]

16:52.144 --> 16:56.715
We have had so many
great moments together.

16:56.782 --> 16:57.950
Mm-hmm.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.653
[Bruce] Twenty-three, going on 25 years
of great moments together.

17:01.720 --> 17:05.057
They still live inside me.
They're still part of me.

17:05.124 --> 17:08.794
I don't wanna let that go.
But I've had a struggle in my life.

17:09.762 --> 17:15.067
And I'm just trying to deal with myself
and what's best for myself.

17:15.667 --> 17:21.407
In so many ways, I've lived
my entire life running away from me

17:22.574 --> 17:23.709
and who I am.

17:23.776 --> 17:26.412
We've raised amazing children.

17:27.679 --> 17:29.915
And those memories
will live inside me forever.

17:29.982 --> 17:33.852
I mean, and I will continue to have more
of those wonderful, wonderful memories.

17:34.586 --> 17:38.357
You know, it's just, it's tough.
And I just wanna get through this

17:38.424 --> 17:42.227
and do the best damn job
of not hurting anybody.

17:42.294 --> 17:43.495
And that includes you.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.932
And I would hope that you would…

17:48.200 --> 17:50.235
you know, kind of be on board.

17:52.104 --> 17:54.206
I know, I think I'm just
so confused right now.

17:54.873 --> 17:56.275
Where's your confusion?

17:56.341 --> 17:59.011
I think you shut me out a long time ago.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.580
-You were angry, which made me angry.
-[Bruce] When you're… Okay.

18:01.647 --> 18:03.115
You know you treated me badly

18:03.182 --> 18:05.451
those last four, five years
of our marriage.

18:05.517 --> 18:08.287
-[Bruce] I wasn't happy.
-No, you were just very, very angry.

18:08.353 --> 18:11.423
To the point of where we just had
to separate and then get divorced.

18:11.490 --> 18:14.259
You never said that this
was gonna be the end result, ever.

18:14.326 --> 18:16.995
-Well, I was angry for--
-So now it makes sense to me.

18:17.062 --> 18:18.764
You know? And I
just think that being honest

18:18.831 --> 18:21.133
is something that we all
would have appreciated.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.768
And I think your truth in your head

18:22.835 --> 18:25.471
is different than the truth
that came out of your mouth.

18:25.537 --> 18:28.073
And the truth in your head
is different than your actions.

18:28.140 --> 18:29.675
Do you know why?

18:29.741 --> 18:32.611
-I'm sure there's a million reasons.
-'Cause I don't wanna hurt you.

18:34.646 --> 18:36.715
[sighs]
God, this isn't easy.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.351
[dramatic music]

18:40.319 --> 18:44.923
I always knew that you struggled
with wanting to dress

18:45.691 --> 18:48.560
differently, and dress as a female.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.630
And that was something
you did whenever you got that urge.

18:52.297 --> 18:53.432
[groans]

18:53.499 --> 18:56.001
That's just what, the only thing
I experienced with you, Bruce.

18:56.068 --> 18:58.704
[Kris] And I don't know
when you went from,

18:59.938 --> 19:02.941
"This isn't working for me anymore,
and I'm gonna go all the way

19:03.008 --> 19:04.743
and I'm gonna start taking hormones."

19:04.810 --> 19:08.380
You never even told me as a married couple
that you were taking hormones.

19:08.447 --> 19:11.984
Wait, I didn't take 'em till after
we left, we went our separate ways.

19:12.050 --> 19:13.886
I wasn't taking 'em
while we were together.

19:15.053 --> 19:17.589
That was all done after we separated.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.692
I went to a therapist,
started to figure myself out.

19:20.759 --> 19:23.061
First thing I did when I moved out
to Malibu was I said,

19:23.128 --> 19:25.097
"Okay, here I am,
I got a house all by myself,

19:25.164 --> 19:26.632
I have to deal with these issues."

19:26.698 --> 19:29.801
That's when I got a therapist,
I started working on things,

19:29.868 --> 19:32.171
trying to figure out my life. Okay?

19:32.237 --> 19:34.907
I did none of that beforehand. Okay?

19:34.973 --> 19:39.578
Um, I took hormones back in the '80s,
way before I met you. I told you I had.

19:39.645 --> 19:42.381
No. You said you
had taken them at one time.

19:42.447 --> 19:45.884
I didn't know if it was for a week
or a month, or a year, or a decade.

19:45.951 --> 19:48.220
Okay, I didn't say
how many years I was on 'em.

19:48.287 --> 19:49.321
[Kris] But you never--

19:49.388 --> 19:52.191
That's part of the problem, Bruce,
is you've never explained.

19:52.257 --> 19:55.227
And every time I said to you,
"Why are you such an angry person?"

19:55.294 --> 19:59.164
You said I just wouldn't understand,
and you couldn't talk to me about it.

19:59.231 --> 20:01.066
-That was your answer every time.
-[Bruce] Okay.

20:01.133 --> 20:05.304
Just so you're aware, ten years prior,
you did the exact same thing,

20:05.370 --> 20:07.739
and I sat down with you
and I said, "What's going on?"

20:08.507 --> 20:10.008
[Kris] And you said, "You're right.

20:10.075 --> 20:12.744
I'm irritable and I'm crazy
and I don't know what's wrong with me."

20:12.811 --> 20:14.346
You knew what was wrong with you.

20:14.413 --> 20:17.883
Same thing that happened all over again
five years ago, four years ago.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.786
I talked to you about it and I said,
"I don't know what's wrong with you,

20:20.852 --> 20:24.323
if you're going through
male menopause or something,

20:24.389 --> 20:26.925
but this isn't… I can't handle this."

20:26.992 --> 20:30.562
And you said, "You're right. I'm sorry."
And we were able to get past it.

20:30.629 --> 20:33.398
You never said one time
that it was because of…

20:34.299 --> 20:36.034
any issues that you had.

20:36.101 --> 20:38.303
And I just thought maybe you
were going through something

20:38.370 --> 20:40.372
and that thing inside of you,

20:40.439 --> 20:45.744
that you can't suppress and that's part
of you, came back five years ago.

20:45.811 --> 20:48.247
And I turned
into the Wicked Witch of the West…

20:48.313 --> 20:49.681
-I apologize.
-…because

20:50.249 --> 20:52.417
of the way you were behaving.
I couldn't take it anymore.

20:52.484 --> 20:55.754
I couldn't work 18 hours a day,
and then have no love at home

20:55.821 --> 20:59.291
and have nobody
that cared about me like that.

20:59.358 --> 21:02.628
Because you were so far gone at that point
that you just needed to go do your thing.

21:02.694 --> 21:03.895
That's why…

21:04.763 --> 21:08.000
it's the exact same problem I've had
since I've been ten years old.

21:09.034 --> 21:11.403
I've always had these issues,
honey, and I end up never…

21:12.471 --> 21:14.306
I've never dealt with them, okay?

21:14.373 --> 21:18.977
But as far as our relationship,
I wouldn't go as far as you're going.

21:19.611 --> 21:23.181
You need to own what the truth is,

21:23.248 --> 21:25.384
and what you think
people knew or didn't know.

21:25.450 --> 21:28.553
-Or how serious. You know what I mean?
-[Bruce] Okay. Okay.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.423
I never saw this coming
in a gazillion years.

21:31.990 --> 21:34.293
[Kris] Your truth isn't always the truth.

21:34.359 --> 21:38.430
You have a story to tell, but you
tell it to people that can't contradict

21:38.497 --> 21:40.132
and say what the truth is, tell the truth.

21:40.198 --> 21:42.434
Sometimes, it's much easier
to talk to somebody

21:42.501 --> 21:46.004
that you're not gonna hurt,
than, you know, it's not easy.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.441
No, it's not.
But you have to tell the truth.

21:49.508 --> 21:51.076
-You just have to tell the truth.
-That's what I'm trying to do.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.645
For the first time in my life,
I'm trying to tell the truth.

21:53.712 --> 21:55.080
I've been to every one of the kids,

21:55.147 --> 21:57.215
one at a time,
bringing them out to Malibu,

21:57.282 --> 21:59.017
sitting 'em down,
saying, "This is the truth."

21:59.084 --> 22:02.988
You are the toughest one
to talk to out of anybody. Okay?

22:03.055 --> 22:06.458
Well, maybe it's because
I'm the one you lied to the longest.

22:06.525 --> 22:08.994
[breathes deeply]

22:09.061 --> 22:11.830
[serious music]

22:12.864 --> 22:15.967
You are the toughest one
to talk to out of anybody. Okay?

22:16.868 --> 22:20.172
Well, maybe it's because
I'm the one you lied to the longest.

22:20.238 --> 22:22.174
[breathes deeply]

22:23.108 --> 22:26.044
I apologize to you for… if I wasn't…

22:29.848 --> 22:34.353
honest enough with myself
over the 20-something years…

22:34.419 --> 22:35.787
-I appreciate it.
-…with you.

22:36.388 --> 22:38.824
I mean, you knew the issues.
I apologize for not…

22:40.158 --> 22:42.361
maybe being more open
with you on these issues.

22:43.095 --> 22:44.863
I apologize for hurting you.

22:44.930 --> 22:46.565
I just miss Bruce.

22:47.699 --> 22:50.635
And that's gonna take a minute
for me to mourn that relationship.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.337
[sobs]

22:52.404 --> 22:56.708
And I'm trying so hard
to just process my pain

22:56.775 --> 22:58.877
and get through my days, it's a struggle.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.113
[Kris] I wake up in the morning,

23:01.179 --> 23:04.149
like, and then I realize,
"Oh, my god, this is really happening."

23:04.216 --> 23:07.419
I have to mourn this person
I was married to for all these years that,

23:07.486 --> 23:09.621
you know, you think you're
gonna grow old with somebody,

23:09.688 --> 23:12.324
and they drastically change
over the course of a few years.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.626
It's like I have to mourn Bruce Jenner.

23:15.794 --> 23:18.563
I'm just, like, I'm confused.
What happens to Bruce?

23:20.198 --> 23:21.333
'Cause I miss Bruce.

23:21.967 --> 23:26.872
I'll never be able to really have Bruce,
and all I have really is my memories.

23:26.938 --> 23:29.141
You know, I look at pictures
of you and the kids

23:29.207 --> 23:31.410
and I get really sad because I feel like…

23:33.211 --> 23:35.514
you died. You know, Bruce died.

23:36.415 --> 23:39.017
And it's really hard for me
to wrap my head around that.

23:39.084 --> 23:42.187
Honestly, I'm not going anywhere.
Things may change.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.723
But I still wanna be part of your life.

23:45.824 --> 23:48.560
[Bruce] And I want you to, you know,
I want you to be a part of my life.

23:48.627 --> 23:50.762
Look at the 25 years together.

23:51.696 --> 23:53.465
<i>You know, wonderful times,
wonderful memories,</i>

23:53.532 --> 23:55.233
<i>all these great things.</i>

23:55.300 --> 23:57.536
I don't want to just throw that out.

23:59.204 --> 24:01.473
And I still love you, baby.

24:03.575 --> 24:05.010
You know, the bottom line here…

24:05.811 --> 24:08.947
And I tried to relay this
to all the kids, and it wasn't easy.

24:09.681 --> 24:11.750
[clears throat]
But…

24:12.918 --> 24:15.086
Hopefully, I'll be a better person.

24:15.687 --> 24:17.155
You know, happier.

24:18.056 --> 24:20.859
I wanna be happy in life.
I wanna have a smile on my face.

24:21.626 --> 24:22.594
I want you to be happy.

24:24.830 --> 24:27.265
I keep thinking, 65.
I'm not gonna be around that much longer.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.836
What if I get cancer
and I got three months to live?

24:31.703 --> 24:35.173
I will be so pissed off at my life
because I never dealt with myself.

24:36.475 --> 24:39.711
Is there anything I can do now…

24:40.846 --> 24:44.416
-to make it better for you?
-Just live the happiest life you can live.

24:45.450 --> 24:48.019
That's all I care about,
is that you go through all of this

24:48.086 --> 24:51.356
for an amazing outcome.

24:51.423 --> 24:52.891
And that you can find the peace

24:52.958 --> 24:54.926
that you've been searching for
for so long.

24:54.993 --> 24:59.097
And I, I just, I just want you to know
that you were a great dad,

24:59.164 --> 25:03.201
you were a great friend, and you were
a great partner and at the end of the day,

25:03.268 --> 25:06.071
I mean, it's not about me and my feelings,

25:06.137 --> 25:08.440
it's about you, and I just
want you to be happy.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.908
This makes me happy.

25:10.542 --> 25:11.877
I understand.

25:11.943 --> 25:14.646
[dramatic music]

25:16.214 --> 25:18.717
[Bruce] All right. I'm going back
out to Malibu. I love you.

25:18.783 --> 25:20.218
[Kris] I love you too.

25:21.286 --> 25:24.756
Uh, drive careful.
[exhales]

25:24.823 --> 25:26.658
-Wipe your mascara.
-[Kris] Yep, I will.

25:26.725 --> 25:28.894
-On my… That's why I wore black.
-[Kris chuckles]

25:28.960 --> 25:29.995
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

25:31.830 --> 25:33.164
-Give me five.
-Yeah.

25:33.231 --> 25:35.066
-Love you. Yeah, I know.
-Okay. Love you too.

25:35.133 --> 25:37.068
-Keep a smile! Okay.
-Okay.

25:37.736 --> 25:40.071
-Everything's gonna be good. All right?
-Okay.

25:40.138 --> 25:42.407
[Bruce] I promise you.
I'll make sure it is.

25:42.474 --> 25:44.543
-Love you.
-[Kris] See you later.

25:47.879 --> 25:50.782
[cries]

25:55.620 --> 25:58.924
-[waves lapping]
-[birds chirping]

26:00.158 --> 26:02.360
-[Kim] Bruce!
-Hey!

26:03.395 --> 26:06.231
-[Bruce] There she is.
-Hey. This room looks familiar.

26:06.298 --> 26:07.866
This was my dad's bed.

26:07.933 --> 26:08.900
Remember that one?

26:08.967 --> 26:11.169
-Sit down, I wanna show you. Have a seat.
-Yes.

26:12.604 --> 26:14.673
My darling little daughter,
out defending me.

26:14.739 --> 26:17.275
"Kim Kardashian says,
'He's the happiest I've ever seen him.'"

26:17.342 --> 26:20.145
-I thank you for defending me.
-[Kim] I know. No, I got caught off-guard.

26:20.211 --> 26:23.782
Out of the blue, it's like,
"So, is Bruce transitioning into a woman?"

26:23.848 --> 26:25.650
And then I was like,
"Okay, well, this is the moment

26:25.717 --> 26:27.118
-that I'm either gonna lie…"
-Yeah.

26:27.185 --> 26:29.721
I can't lie because I know
it's gonna come out.

26:29.788 --> 26:32.490
-"He's the happiest I've ever seen him."
-I am happy.

26:32.557 --> 26:34.926
"And when and if he ever wants
to address the rumors,

26:34.993 --> 26:38.229
-that's his story to tell, not mine."
-That's right. Yeah, perfect.

26:38.296 --> 26:42.901
Bruce deserves to be happy,
and he deserves to be who he wants to be.

26:42.968 --> 26:44.469
Even though I haven't really seen her,

26:44.536 --> 26:47.305
when he talks about her, he's happy,
and that makes me happy.

26:47.372 --> 26:49.507
Everyone should maybe
meet her in their own time.

26:49.574 --> 26:52.978
I don't know that it should be like
when he got his face-lift,

26:53.044 --> 26:56.581
and everyone like, a chair turns,
and he's like, "I'm here! Abracadabra!"

26:56.648 --> 26:59.384
My biggest fear about meeting her
for the first time

26:59.451 --> 27:00.986
is just, I think, my reaction.

27:01.052 --> 27:04.589
I'm very facially expressive, like,
you could read everything on my face.

27:04.656 --> 27:05.857
And I don't wanna do anything

27:05.924 --> 27:07.626
that would be offensive
or hurt her feelings.

27:07.692 --> 27:09.394
So I think I'm just very aware of that.

27:09.461 --> 27:12.530
It might be a little weird.
I think, once I'm ready.

27:14.332 --> 27:16.301
I mean, it's gonna have to happen someday.

27:16.935 --> 27:18.136
I do wanna meet her.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.739
But, like, when he's ready,
when we're both ready.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.875
I came over because I told you once

27:23.942 --> 27:27.479
that I was going to help you
look through your clothes.

27:27.545 --> 27:29.547
-Male or female?
-Female.

27:29.614 --> 27:30.949
[laughs]

27:31.016 --> 27:32.183
And I think I'm ready.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.619
-You think you can handle it?
-[Kim] Yeah. We can do a piece at a time.

27:34.686 --> 27:36.521
[Bruce] A piece at a time.
I would love your input.

27:36.588 --> 27:39.124
We can start
by getting rid of anything neon.

27:41.059 --> 27:42.494
Actually, she doesn't have any neon.

27:42.560 --> 27:43.695
-Let me get a rack.
-[Kim] Thank God.

27:43.762 --> 27:46.898
Hold on. Fun stuff!

27:46.965 --> 27:47.999
[metal squeaks]

27:48.066 --> 27:50.135
[Bruce] <i>They're all kind of nervous
to meet her.</i>

27:50.201 --> 27:52.837
It's obviously pretty funny,
'cause I've been doing this a long time.

27:52.904 --> 27:56.608
She is always more fun, more at ease,

27:56.675 --> 28:00.712
um, feeling good about herself,
it's just all part of me, you know.

28:00.779 --> 28:04.883
It's like having Bruce with a little icing
on the cake, okay? It only gets better.

28:04.949 --> 28:08.253
This is actually stuff
I got just recently.

28:08.319 --> 28:11.089
Actually, the other night,
I had a business date here.

28:11.156 --> 28:12.323
And I'll show you what I wore.

28:13.391 --> 28:15.694
-I wore this black blazer.
-Yes.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.862
-[Bruce] Okay, very classic.
-[Kim] Size 14.

28:17.929 --> 28:20.498
-And then, with this.
-[Kim] Nice. I like that.

28:20.565 --> 28:22.767
-Actually, that one came out very good.
-Low in the front.

28:22.834 --> 28:24.969
Then my pants…

28:25.036 --> 28:27.605
[Bruce humming]

28:27.672 --> 28:30.875
-I wore these tight pants.
-[Kim] Nice!

28:30.942 --> 28:34.179
-They really fit well. With these boots.
-[Kim] Nice.

28:34.245 --> 28:35.680
-Did I do good?
-[Kim] Yeah, you did.

28:35.747 --> 28:37.615
-I don't mind this. This is nice.
-Yeah, yeah.

28:37.682 --> 28:42.420
[Kim] I'm making a to-go pile.
This doesn't bug me. This has got to go.

28:42.487 --> 28:43.688
Actually, the one that works well…

28:43.755 --> 28:45.924
Hold on. Let me just go through
and tell you what I like.

28:45.990 --> 28:47.559
-Red could be okay.
-These are just little stuff for jeans,

28:47.625 --> 28:49.527
-casual wear.
-I don't like this color.

28:49.594 --> 28:51.396
I think you have to be chicer than this.

28:51.463 --> 28:54.165
[Kim] What about a turtleneck?
I love turtlenecks.

28:54.766 --> 28:58.269
-Um, can I confess?
-[Kim] What? You copy my outfits.

28:58.336 --> 28:59.704
-No.
-Oh!

28:59.771 --> 29:02.907
-[Bruce] I stole your outfit.
-What? You stole my outfit?

29:02.974 --> 29:06.377
-A long, long time ago. I got to find it.
-Oh, my god.

29:09.447 --> 29:12.417
-[Kim] You stole my outfit?
-[Bruce] A long, long time ago.

29:12.484 --> 29:14.419
-Okay, I got to find it.
-Oh, my god.

29:15.220 --> 29:18.156
Oh, my, I'll literally kill you
if it's something that I was missing

29:18.223 --> 29:20.158
and I probably accused
Kendall and Kylie of--

29:20.225 --> 29:22.127
Do you ever remember that?
You probably don't.

29:22.193 --> 29:24.129
The clothes come in and out
of your closet so fast.

29:24.195 --> 29:25.130
-This, you can have.
-That will pass?

29:25.196 --> 29:27.432
-So let me put together an outfit for you.
-[Bruce] Okay.

29:27.499 --> 29:30.602
I think this and this,
this is a good outfit together.

29:30.668 --> 29:33.138
-[Bruce] That does work.
-I can't believe you're so sneaky.

29:33.204 --> 29:34.272
Let me ask you something.

29:34.339 --> 29:38.076
Were you ever, like, envious
of my mom, like of her closet?

29:38.143 --> 29:40.845
Well, I've went through everything she had
in her closet, of course, I was envious.

29:40.912 --> 29:42.480
-Yeah.
-[Bruce] Yeah.

29:42.547 --> 29:45.216
[Bruce] How about a hot little outfit?

29:45.283 --> 29:47.752
[Kim] Oh, my god.
I don't like the leopard.

29:47.819 --> 29:50.021
Well, this one's kind of blue, so--
But it looks cool. It really fits great.

29:50.088 --> 29:51.990
I'm not so into that,
but if you're into it.

29:52.056 --> 29:55.426
Yeah, no, I'm not really…
I got such an open mind.

29:55.493 --> 29:56.795
I like classy kind of stuff.

29:56.861 --> 29:59.063
That's a little, you know,
kind of your boobs are showing.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.832
And, you know, but this and that.
But it fits really well.

30:00.899 --> 30:02.200
-Yeah.
-You know.

30:02.934 --> 30:03.868
[Bruce] Yeah.

30:03.935 --> 30:07.338
-Uh, hold it. Other things I like.
-That I like.

30:07.405 --> 30:10.141
-That actually fits great. Yeah.
-Looks like a pale blush.

30:10.208 --> 30:12.844
So what is gonna happen
after Diane Sawyer comes out?

30:12.911 --> 30:16.581
-Like, what's the plan?
-What's the plan? Take my ponytail down.

30:16.648 --> 30:17.916
[chuckles]

30:17.982 --> 30:21.386
I can take my ponytail down, I don't have
to do that anymore. Um, what's my plan?

30:22.120 --> 30:23.755
-I'm just moving forward in my life.
-Yeah.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.557
Looking forward to that.

30:25.623 --> 30:27.625
Uh, there's no more secrets.

30:27.692 --> 30:30.428
Uh, I don't have to hide anything.
Kind of--

30:30.495 --> 30:34.465
I am who I am, and move forward in life
with a smile on my face, sense of humor.

30:34.532 --> 30:37.902
[Bruce] And I want to experience her.
I want to enjoy her.

30:37.969 --> 30:40.538
'Cause she's such
a part of my life, you know.

30:40.605 --> 30:41.606
Totally.

30:42.407 --> 30:43.875
-Okay. All right.
-All right.

30:43.942 --> 30:46.244
[Kim] I need to see what's in this closet.
I just wanna see.

30:46.311 --> 30:48.379
-Okay, there's stuff. I got to get…
-Oh, her makeup.

30:48.446 --> 30:50.148
-At the next house…
-This foundation does--

30:50.215 --> 30:51.816
[Kim] Did you steal this from me?

30:51.883 --> 30:53.985
I don't think so.
Actually, I did steal this.

30:54.052 --> 30:56.421
-[Kim] You did.
-No, wait a second. Those are mine.

30:56.487 --> 30:59.958
I got so much makeup, I can't take it.
I got to organize shoes.

31:00.024 --> 31:02.393
A lot of work to do, this girl thing.
This girl thing's a lot of work.

31:02.460 --> 31:03.928
-Yeah, you really gotta organize those.
-Yeah.

31:03.995 --> 31:08.199
-It's very challenging to find 13-wides.
-This turtleneck dress is my favorite.

31:08.266 --> 31:10.101
-Which one?
-This is what you should be wearing.

31:10.168 --> 31:11.903
Actually, Mom. I got that from Mom.

31:11.970 --> 31:14.906
I stole that from her.
You see, it's too long for her.

31:14.973 --> 31:16.975
-[Kim] This is so horrendous.
-I bought it online.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.444
-[Kim] Can you get rid of that, please?
-Oh, god.

31:19.510 --> 31:21.179
-I can't get rid of it.
-[Kim] Why?

31:21.246 --> 31:23.481
-'Cause it's like good for the morning.
-[Kim] "Good for the morning."

31:23.548 --> 31:27.085
Bruce, you should look good at all times.
Yeah. Anyway, I appreciate all your help.

31:27.151 --> 31:29.821
I couldn't have a better stylist than you.
That's for damn sure, girl.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.289
Well, if you're keeping
some of these pieces,

31:31.356 --> 31:32.790
I don't wanna be known as your stylist.

31:32.857 --> 31:35.159
-Oh, okay. Okay, see how the look goes?
-I have to wait until

31:35.226 --> 31:37.328
you really listen to me, yeah.
I feel like I have to, like, see…

31:37.395 --> 31:40.231
-When I get in the new house.
-…her fully dressed before I can claim--

31:40.298 --> 31:41.432
Claim that you actually did it.

31:41.499 --> 31:42.634
-Yes, yeah.
-Okay, okay, that is a deal.

31:42.700 --> 31:44.535
-[Kim] All right, I'm gonna go.
-Okay.

31:44.602 --> 31:46.104
-Love you.
-Thanks for coming out.

31:46.170 --> 31:47.906
-You are so welcome.
-Love you.

31:47.972 --> 31:51.242
-Love you! That was so much fun.
-[Kim] That was so much fun.

31:51.309 --> 31:53.311
[Bruce] I never thought
I would do that with you.

31:56.214 --> 32:00.018
The only thing I want out of this
is just to help people.

32:00.818 --> 32:03.888
Not just the transgender community.
It's really bigger than that.

32:03.955 --> 32:05.156
It's so much more.

32:05.223 --> 32:07.625
Uh, there's so many things
about tolerance towards people,

32:07.692 --> 32:09.360
about understanding of people.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.829
We need more tolerance
in the world toward our fellow man.

32:11.896 --> 32:15.099
I mean, we're all human beings
put on this Earth, you know.

32:15.733 --> 32:17.702
We need to, uh, learn to live together.

32:19.037 --> 32:22.006
I hope for this to turn
into something amazing.

32:22.073 --> 32:23.641
[gentle music]

32:23.708 --> 32:25.610
He's gone 65 years hiding something.

32:25.677 --> 32:32.150
Why not just, like, be who you wanna be
and if that's her, then that's her.

32:32.216 --> 32:34.118
-[Khloé] Make it a good one.
-[shutter clicks]

32:34.185 --> 32:39.891
I'm excited for him. I'd just, like, feel
so horrible if he always had this inside

32:39.958 --> 32:42.860
and, like, never, like, got
to fully be himself.

32:43.661 --> 32:46.431
[Khloé] <i>It breaks my heart
that he's been miserable his entire life.</i>

32:46.497 --> 32:50.668
All these kids, great father,
great family, but he was never happy.

32:50.735 --> 32:53.271
<i>Through 65 years of his life,
has never been happy.</i>

32:53.338 --> 32:55.073
I wouldn't want anyone
to live life that way.

32:55.139 --> 32:56.874
And that breaks my heart.
That makes me sad.

32:56.941 --> 32:58.977
-[camera shutter clicks]
-Did we all do a piece?

32:59.043 --> 33:01.612
As a family, we all, I know,
are the same way.

33:01.679 --> 33:03.715
We just want each other to be happy.

33:03.781 --> 33:04.949
We all have the best
hair and makeup teams.

33:05.016 --> 33:07.852
You cannot steal our hair and makeup team.
You cannot steal our nail lady.

33:07.919 --> 33:10.588
Now that Bruce can finally be
who he is meant to be

33:10.655 --> 33:12.523
and who he wants to be,

33:12.590 --> 33:15.827
and that this secret has been lifted
and this big weight has been lifted,

33:15.893 --> 33:19.030
<i>he can live his life
and hopefully live a happy life.</i>

33:19.097 --> 33:23.701
I respect Bruce for doing what he needs
to do to make himself grounded and happy.

33:23.768 --> 33:26.804
No matter what happens,
our love for Bruce is never gonna change,

33:26.871 --> 33:27.872
no matter who he becomes.

33:27.939 --> 33:29.507
-Love you.
-Love you.

33:29.574 --> 33:31.509
I think that the one thing that…

33:32.677 --> 33:37.615
I ultimately care about is that
we're just here for each other.

33:37.682 --> 33:38.783
[Kris] <i>Family is everything.</i>

33:39.951 --> 33:42.920
<i>I would do anything for my kids,
I would do anything for Bruce,</i>

33:42.987 --> 33:45.223
<i>and I would do anything
for anybody that I loved.</i>

33:45.289 --> 33:47.892
At the end of the day,
that's what family's all about.

33:47.959 --> 33:50.361
[uplifting music]

33:50.428 --> 33:54.432
I'm looking forward to the future
and I hope I can bring a lot of my family

33:54.499 --> 33:59.003
and my friends along for the journey
'cause it's going to be quite a ride.
