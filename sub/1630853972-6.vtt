WEBVTT

00:12.626 --> 00:14.161
This is the main vault

00:14.195 --> 00:16.466
of the Global Currency Bank
of New York.

00:16.499 --> 00:18.203
You will retrieve the contents

00:18.236 --> 00:21.042
of this safe deposit box tonight.

00:21.075 --> 00:23.581
Questions?
- Uh, just one jillion.

00:23.614 --> 00:25.484
You want us to rob a bank?

00:25.518 --> 00:27.756
- Yeah, that was the first one.
- Of course not.

00:27.789 --> 00:29.392
How is this not
robbing a bank?

00:29.425 --> 00:32.164
Because we won't use
those words.

00:32.197 --> 00:33.266
Yeah, that'll hold up
in court.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.468
Also, night in general

00:34.503 --> 00:36.172
is kind of a bad time for me.

00:36.206 --> 00:38.410
I have experiments that I need
to feed after midnight.

00:38.443 --> 00:40.480
Not to be
Mr. All About the Rules...

00:40.515 --> 00:43.086
- Hey, there's a first.
- But wouldn't this be crossing

00:43.119 --> 00:45.357
pretty big moral
and ethical lines?

00:45.390 --> 00:48.463
I'm sorry, but Cyril
is rrr--r-right.

00:48.496 --> 00:50.735
Wow, saying that felt
even worse than thinking it.

00:50.768 --> 00:53.406
Yeah, the agency isn't really
in the business

00:53.440 --> 00:55.110
of committing pure crime...

00:55.143 --> 00:57.549
- We're not?
- That isn't espionage-related.

00:57.582 --> 00:59.085
Oh, okay.

00:59.118 --> 01:00.287
'Cause I was gonna say,

01:00.320 --> 01:02.291
we kill people,
like, all the time.

01:02.324 --> 01:04.262
Oh, come on.
It's not that bad.

01:04.295 --> 01:05.865
We'll be in and out,
easy peasy.

01:05.898 --> 01:08.236
Um, that sounds neither easy
nor peasy.

01:08.270 --> 01:10.508
And not that it's ever
a great time to go to prison,

01:10.541 --> 01:12.812
but I have my custody hearing
for AJ coming up,

01:12.846 --> 01:15.350
and they tend to frown
on recent felons.

01:15.384 --> 01:16.787
Hey,
maybe it's for a good cause.

01:16.820 --> 01:19.225
Like what if there's a baby
monkey trapped in the box?

01:19.258 --> 01:20.795
You could tell us that.
I'm willing to believe it.

01:20.828 --> 01:23.266
Ooh, yes!
Let's say there is

01:23.300 --> 01:26.472
an extremely adorable
little monkey in the box

01:26.507 --> 01:29.211
and that poor little fella
needs to be retrieved

01:29.245 --> 01:32.619
before open of business
tomorrow at 9:00 a. m.

01:32.652 --> 01:35.357
After that point,
I'm afraid it'll be too late

01:35.390 --> 01:38.430
for the little chap,
but I can provide incentive.

01:38.463 --> 01:41.837
If you do this, IIA will give
you back ownership

01:41.870 --> 01:44.241
of the agency,
along with the budget

01:44.275 --> 01:45.578
for the next six months.

01:45.612 --> 01:47.616
- Whoa. Really?
- That would be enough

01:47.649 --> 01:49.653
to get us fully back up
and running.

01:49.686 --> 01:52.191
It sounds good,
but let's see that in--

01:52.224 --> 01:53.360
writing.

01:53.393 --> 01:54.462
Well, I'll be damned.

01:54.495 --> 01:55.832
Notarized and everything.

01:55.865 --> 01:58.236
Okay, Fabian.
With my peerless leadership,

01:58.269 --> 02:00.407
we're gonna do this mission,
save the agency,

02:00.440 --> 02:01.710
and when it's finished,
I'm gonna laugh

02:01.744 --> 02:03.313
in your fat face.

02:03.346 --> 02:06.285
Here's to complete,
utter victory.

02:08.189 --> 02:10.828
So, uh, are all of you trapped?

02:10.862 --> 02:11.897
Yep.

02:11.930 --> 02:12.899
Yep.

02:12.932 --> 02:14.736
- Yep.
- Yeah--

02:16.239 --> 02:18.376
That monkey is doomed.

02:58.390 --> 03:00.193
So in retrospect,
it would've been good to know

03:00.227 --> 03:01.764
that the vault door
closes automatically

03:01.797 --> 03:03.266
after ten minutes.

03:03.299 --> 03:04.603
Pam, any luck disabling it?

03:04.636 --> 03:05.638
No, but I am...

03:05.671 --> 03:07.575
Totally stuck.

03:07.609 --> 03:09.813
Tell me about it.
These guys won't shut up.

03:09.846 --> 03:12.685
My lower gluteus is about
to, well, I guess really tear,

03:12.719 --> 03:14.388
but whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:14.422 --> 03:16.325
I'm fine.
I mean, not really.

03:16.359 --> 03:17.629
So what are we doing?

03:17.662 --> 03:19.298
Well,
our leader is incompetent,

03:19.331 --> 03:20.902
I'm this close
to losing my daughter,

03:20.935 --> 03:23.440
and now I'm trapped in a vault
with the most irritating

03:23.473 --> 03:25.210
human being alive.

03:25.243 --> 03:27.749
Uh, comms went down
when the vault closed.

03:27.782 --> 03:30.220
We can't hear them.
They can't hear you.

03:30.253 --> 03:32.324
Oh, I know.
I just wanted you to hear it.

03:32.357 --> 03:34.295
As a leader,
sometimes it's hard to admit,

03:34.328 --> 03:35.965
but I have terrible followers.

03:35.998 --> 03:37.736
Ah, the mark
of a true leader:

03:37.769 --> 03:38.804
passing the blame.

03:38.838 --> 03:40.440
I didn't invent banks, Ray,

03:40.474 --> 03:41.744
so direct your shitty comments

03:41.777 --> 03:44.315
to the Assyrians
or possibly Sumerians.

03:44.348 --> 03:46.352
Indus Valley also in the mix.

03:46.385 --> 03:49.291
Will you shush it?
There are guards right outside.

03:49.325 --> 03:50.795
But for the record,
a good leader

03:50.828 --> 03:53.667
slips the criticism in
between a compliment sandwich.

03:53.701 --> 03:56.305
Like "Pam, great idea getting
up on the vault,

03:56.339 --> 03:57.976
"but next time, maybe try
to demonstrate

03:58.009 --> 03:59.780
"some basic spatial awareness.

03:59.813 --> 04:02.317
Also, your skin has been
glowing lately."

04:02.351 --> 04:03.453
Yeah, what's up with that?

04:03.486 --> 04:05.424
Are you pregnant or in love?

04:05.457 --> 04:07.896
Ooh, wait, did you drink
a bunch of nuclear waste?

04:07.929 --> 04:10.601
Ew, no.
Definitely not pregnant.

04:10.635 --> 04:12.705
Can we just focus on not going
to jail, please?

04:12.739 --> 04:13.941
I have brunch plans.

04:13.974 --> 04:15.812
You have a point, Pam,
but also brunch

04:15.845 --> 04:18.651
is a stupid reason to not wanna
go to jail, so pipe down.

04:18.684 --> 04:20.053
I have a plan.

04:20.086 --> 04:21.824
Pam, you're gonna drill
a hole in the vault

04:21.857 --> 04:22.959
so we can reestablish communication

04:22.992 --> 04:24.428
with Lana and Cyril.

04:24.462 --> 04:25.998
Krieger,
you hack the intercom system

04:26.032 --> 04:28.303
with an emergency announcement
to cover the noise.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.307
Gillette, while all the guards
are distracted,

04:30.340 --> 04:31.844
you'll be free
to exit the closet,

04:31.877 --> 04:34.983
find the security grid,
and disable it for Krieger.

04:35.016 --> 04:36.753
Now I'm gonna go head

04:36.787 --> 04:38.423
into the executive offices upstairs

04:38.456 --> 04:40.460
to find an override code
for the vault.

04:40.494 --> 04:42.899
And also find more booze
that you just ran out of?

04:42.932 --> 04:44.736
You know,
I was being nice before, Pam.

04:44.769 --> 04:45.771
Your skin doesn't look

04:45.805 --> 04:46.974
that much better.
all: What?

04:47.007 --> 04:48.409
You are a monster, sir.

04:48.443 --> 04:50.447
Fine, getting a drink
is a secondary part

04:50.480 --> 04:52.952
of the plan,
but I'm only being responsible.

04:52.986 --> 04:55.357
I'm about to be sober for
the first time in ten years.

04:55.390 --> 04:58.329
If that hangover hits head-on,
my bones will explode.

04:58.363 --> 05:00.100
Krieger, you ready to hack
into the sound system?

05:00.133 --> 05:02.605
Okay,
doing this behind my back,

05:02.639 --> 05:05.343
but I'm pretty sure
I got the right jack.

05:05.377 --> 05:07.816
On my mark.
Three, two, one.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.953
- Aah!

05:09.986 --> 05:11.723
It may not have been
the right one.

05:11.757 --> 05:13.594
God damn it.
Everyone, just go with it.

05:16.132 --> 05:17.669
- Is it really that bad?

05:17.702 --> 05:19.506
I still just mostly hear
my ears ringing.

05:19.539 --> 05:21.810
Thanks, tinnitus.

05:21.844 --> 05:24.081
Okay, security control room,

05:24.114 --> 05:26.753
that should be better labeled.

05:26.787 --> 05:27.856
- Stop right there!

05:27.889 --> 05:29.759
Whoa, whoa, hold up.
I work here.

05:29.793 --> 05:30.995
It's my first day.

05:31.028 --> 05:32.832
Is that how you say hello,
with a gun?

05:32.866 --> 05:35.003
Pretty much.
Better safe than sorry.

05:35.036 --> 05:36.472
Well,
if you were any more safe,

05:36.507 --> 05:37.842
there'd be a bunch of holes
in me.

05:37.876 --> 05:39.411
I meant safe for me.

05:39.445 --> 05:41.717
Clearly.
So can you show me around?

05:41.750 --> 05:43.821
I still haven't seen
the security grid setup.

05:43.854 --> 05:46.025
Sure, but it's all pointless.

05:46.058 --> 05:48.898
I don't know why these
dinosaurs are so worried

05:48.931 --> 05:51.737
about their precious
physical dollars and cents.

05:51.770 --> 05:53.641
Money is an illusion.

05:53.674 --> 05:56.880
That's an interesting take
for a bank security guard.

05:56.914 --> 05:59.151
Not really.
I've seen things here.

05:59.184 --> 06:02.391
The suits, the architecture,
the green paper--

06:02.424 --> 06:05.898
it's all symbolic,
like marriage and seagulls.

06:05.932 --> 06:08.136
Wow, you are covering a lot
of ground here.

06:08.169 --> 06:11.375
So do you smoke grass
or are you a narc?

06:11.409 --> 06:13.914
Yes to the first,
no to the second.

06:13.948 --> 06:15.450
You guys doing all right
down there?

06:15.483 --> 06:17.689
Uh, yeah. Not so great.

06:17.722 --> 06:20.528
We found the safe deposit box,
but we can't get it open.

06:20.561 --> 06:21.897
- And Cyril miraculously

06:21.930 --> 06:23.433
hasn't sucked all the air
out of the room

06:23.466 --> 06:25.170
with all
his stupid hyperventilating.

06:25.203 --> 06:27.107
This is a very small space.

06:27.140 --> 06:29.078
Nice work, just Lana.

06:29.111 --> 06:30.548
Ugh, when the door closed,

06:30.581 --> 06:31.917
I was in the middle
of a strategy call

06:31.950 --> 06:33.854
for AJ's custody hearing
with my lawyer.

06:33.887 --> 06:35.658
Ah, well,
my friend who's a lawyer,

06:35.691 --> 06:38.631
which is why she's taking
my call at... 7:45?

06:38.664 --> 06:39.933
Crap! We need to hurry!

06:39.966 --> 06:41.068
Don't worry.
We'll get you out.

06:41.102 --> 06:42.037
Then you can get back
to making

06:42.070 --> 06:43.139
your friends' lives miserable,

06:43.172 --> 06:44.876
and I'll be on time
for my brunch.

06:44.910 --> 06:46.145
We'll be trapped in here
till we die,

06:46.178 --> 06:47.916
our bodies decaying
on the floor.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.686
- Aw, come on, hon.

06:49.719 --> 06:50.955
That's not true.

06:50.988 --> 06:54.094
They'd remove our bodies
way before they decayed.

06:54.128 --> 06:55.631
And don't think of it
as trapped.

06:55.665 --> 06:56.967
It could be kinda nice, right?

06:57.000 --> 07:00.006
Just one person
for the rest of your life?

07:00.040 --> 07:02.578
You know, it kind of feels
like we switched subjects here,

07:02.612 --> 07:04.816
but do you think the best
audience for that kind of talk

07:04.849 --> 07:06.485
is the lady
whose ex-husband is fighting

07:06.520 --> 07:07.989
for control of her daughter?

07:08.022 --> 07:09.458
N--
And is locked in a vault

07:09.491 --> 07:10.761
with her feckless
ex-boyfriend?

07:10.795 --> 07:11.763
N--
And whose

07:11.797 --> 07:12.799
other ex-boyfriend

07:12.832 --> 07:15.003
got her stuck in here?

07:15.036 --> 07:16.573
Can I say no now?

07:16.607 --> 07:17.642
You better.

07:18.677 --> 07:19.913
God damn these young execs

07:19.946 --> 07:21.115
and their green juices.

07:21.148 --> 07:22.518
Doesn't anyone have the decency

07:22.552 --> 07:24.054
to be drunk at work anymore?

07:24.088 --> 07:26.125
Wait, kombucha has alcohol.

07:26.158 --> 07:27.929
"May contain trace amounts
of alcohol."

07:27.962 --> 07:29.532
May? Trace?

07:29.566 --> 07:32.037
Two words that should never be
near alcohol.

07:32.070 --> 07:35.010
Mm, except on Cinco de Mayo
or with Dick Tracy.

07:35.043 --> 07:36.747
Or both.
Man, that'd be a kick.

07:36.780 --> 07:38.717
Archer, I got out!

07:38.751 --> 07:42.124
Those strippercize classes
really helped with my shimmy.

07:42.157 --> 07:44.028
You truly are
a Renaissance woman.

07:44.061 --> 07:46.098
Though I should say,
my knowledge of that era

07:46.132 --> 07:47.735
mostly comes
from historically-themed

07:47.769 --> 07:49.873
pornography.
- And I would like to see that,

07:49.906 --> 07:52.144
but, uh, not seeing
much progress here.

07:52.177 --> 07:54.148
[groans] Sorry.
I'm a little fuzzy.

07:54.181 --> 07:55.785
I think that hangover's
on its way.

07:55.818 --> 07:56.753
Would you get your head
in the game?

07:56.787 --> 07:57.889
If we don't get out of here,

07:57.922 --> 07:59.826
we are risking
a hostage situation,

07:59.859 --> 08:01.863
civilian casualties,
and prison.

08:01.897 --> 08:04.134
And I'll miss
my 8:30 brunch reservations.

08:04.168 --> 08:05.738
8:30?

08:05.771 --> 08:07.207
What kind of psychopath
has brunch at 8:30?

08:07.240 --> 08:08.644
That's breakfast, Pam.

08:08.677 --> 08:10.881
We can and will argue
about that later,

08:10.915 --> 08:12.952
but what do we do now?

08:12.985 --> 08:15.758
God damn it, there's only
one person who can help us.

08:21.703 --> 08:23.172
Wait,
what was I laughing about?

08:28.717 --> 08:30.688
- Well, well, well.

08:30.721 --> 08:33.026
Look who came crawling back.

08:33.059 --> 08:34.294
Hey, neck bones.

08:34.328 --> 08:35.998
Oh, it's you.

08:36.032 --> 08:37.535
I thought it was someone else.

08:37.568 --> 08:39.304
Their legs don't work.
- We need your help.

08:39.338 --> 08:41.676
Oh, and by "we," do you mean
your longtime colleagues

08:41.710 --> 08:43.547
who couldn't be bothered
to reach out to their boss

08:43.580 --> 08:45.684
after she was humiliatingly
fired?

08:45.718 --> 08:47.955
Yes, totally fair,
except you weren't the boss,

08:47.989 --> 08:50.561
I left a bunch of messages,
and you quit.

08:50.594 --> 08:53.166
Oh, who's to say what is?

08:53.199 --> 08:54.636
Cheryl,
we're stuck in a bank,

08:54.669 --> 08:56.640
and we need you to open
a VIP safe deposit box

08:56.673 --> 08:58.142
to get Lana and Cyril out
of the vault.

08:58.176 --> 08:59.612
Okay, pretend
to be an eccentric,

08:59.646 --> 09:01.082
out-of-touch oligarch.

09:01.115 --> 09:02.084
No,
you don't need to pretend.

09:02.117 --> 09:03.654
You are those things.

09:03.687 --> 09:05.791
Ooh, and this will be
a great opportunity

09:05.825 --> 09:07.662
to use my self-taught
demolition skills.

09:07.695 --> 09:09.331
No, no, no, no.
Don't bring bomb--

09:09.364 --> 09:12.104
Well, that went something.

09:12.137 --> 09:13.907
Pam,
see if you can help Krieger.

09:13.941 --> 09:16.278
I'll be down as soon
as I possibly can. Out.

09:16.312 --> 09:17.915
Whiskey.

09:17.949 --> 09:20.688
Thank the Kentucky gods.

09:20.721 --> 09:22.592
A lesser man might find
this humiliating,

09:22.625 --> 09:24.228
but a man such as I--

09:24.261 --> 09:25.898
eh, forget it.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.169
Oh, my God.

09:29.639 --> 09:31.308
That's the best drink
I've ever had!

09:31.342 --> 09:32.812
- Who the hell are you?

09:32.845 --> 09:34.114
Oh, sorry. Was this yours?

09:34.148 --> 09:35.684
Whoa, Susan.

09:35.718 --> 09:38.055
You must know Mr. Bank.

09:38.089 --> 09:40.093
Hi, Susan.
Yes, I'm Mr. Bank.

09:40.126 --> 09:41.730
And I work at a bank.

09:41.763 --> 09:43.299
Sometimes I wonder,
"Is that a coincidence,

09:43.332 --> 09:46.606
or did the name Bank create
a subtle psychological pressure

09:46.640 --> 09:47.642
for me to work at a bank?"

09:47.675 --> 09:49.278
Either way, I do my job

09:49.311 --> 09:50.948
all the time, and I do it well.

09:50.981 --> 09:52.852
"You can bank on Bank,"
I always say.

09:52.885 --> 09:55.624
Yeah, he does overseas stuff,
so he has weird hours.

09:55.658 --> 09:57.027
Probably why y'all haven't met.

09:57.060 --> 09:59.198
How do you know this guy
if it's your first day?

09:59.231 --> 10:01.001
Because...

10:01.035 --> 10:03.206
We're old pals.
I got him the job.

10:03.239 --> 10:04.943
He's been going
through a rough time

10:04.976 --> 10:07.114
with all the embezzling
and prostitution

10:07.147 --> 10:09.118
and mild cannibalism.

10:09.151 --> 10:11.857
Don't worry, I went to rehab
for all of that.

10:11.890 --> 10:13.259
Who hasn't?

10:13.292 --> 10:14.796
So is there any reason

10:14.829 --> 10:17.000
you guys smell
like a hacky sack convention?

10:17.033 --> 10:19.171
Is there a reason
you smell like a narc?

10:19.204 --> 10:20.875
Is this guy a narc?
- No way.

10:20.908 --> 10:22.945
In fact, I bet he'd love
to hear your theories

10:22.979 --> 10:25.383
about alien infiltration
of the World Court.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.354
She's been telling me
all about it on our way

10:27.387 --> 10:30.160
to the security control room.

10:30.193 --> 10:33.967
I, for one, think the aliens
have been a positive influence.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.704
You know what?
That does sound fascinating.

10:35.738 --> 10:37.642
I'll join you.
- Wonderful.

10:37.675 --> 10:41.115
You know, you two are just like
the sons I would've had

10:41.148 --> 10:44.021
if I hadn't predicted
that end-stage capitalism

10:44.054 --> 10:45.991
would make it impossible
to support a family

10:46.025 --> 10:47.194
on my salary.

10:47.227 --> 10:49.031
Amen, sister.

10:49.064 --> 10:51.903
Guys, my entire body
is going numb,

10:51.937 --> 10:53.172
and not in the fun way.

10:53.206 --> 10:54.374
Stay strong, buddy.

10:54.408 --> 10:56.245
Just focus on all
the weird science shit

10:56.278 --> 10:57.915
you'll get to do
when you get out of here.

10:57.949 --> 11:00.955
Yes,
no holding back anymore.

11:00.988 --> 11:04.428
I'll expose all the truths
"science" is too scared

11:04.461 --> 11:05.698
to admit.

11:05.731 --> 11:07.434
Oh, boy.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.739
Ugh, still nothing.

11:09.772 --> 11:11.877
Why don't you
hire an actual lawyer

11:11.910 --> 11:15.049
who can talk to you
during normal business hours?

11:15.083 --> 11:16.853
Because then I wouldn't get
to do this.

11:16.887 --> 11:17.989
Ow!

11:18.022 --> 11:18.991
Oh, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

11:19.024 --> 11:20.059
I have bars!

11:20.093 --> 11:21.763
Shh, I'm on the phone.

11:21.796 --> 11:25.336
Hey, sorry I lost you
when we got locked in the, um--

11:25.370 --> 11:26.806
uh, in the tunnel.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.209
You were saying?

11:30.213 --> 11:31.716
No, never. No.

11:31.750 --> 11:32.484
Yes!

11:32.518 --> 11:34.454
Let the bank robbing begin!

11:34.488 --> 11:36.425
- No, no.

11:36.458 --> 11:38.095
That's not what he meant.

11:38.129 --> 11:39.498
Girl, you're hilarious.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.968
Me robbing a bank?

11:41.001 --> 11:44.241
Oh, could you even imagine?

11:44.274 --> 11:46.078
But hypothetically,
how bad would that be?

11:46.111 --> 11:49.986
So here we are
at the security controls.

11:50.019 --> 11:51.890
This switch controls the grid
in the lobby

11:51.923 --> 11:54.361
and this is the executive
offices upstairs.

11:54.394 --> 11:57.133
This one's for the grid
surrounding the main vault.

11:57.167 --> 11:58.302
How does it operate?

11:58.336 --> 12:00.373
If I wanted to turn it off,

12:00.406 --> 12:02.177
would I just do this?

12:03.547 --> 12:05.951
Thank nonexistent God
in made-up heaven.

12:05.985 --> 12:08.991
- Oh, we can't do that, sir.

12:10.260 --> 12:11.262
Hang on, wait a second.

12:11.295 --> 12:13.165
If all this is symbolic anyway,

12:13.199 --> 12:15.470
it really only matters
if people think it's there.

12:15.504 --> 12:16.973
- But me getting fired

12:17.007 --> 12:18.376
isn't symbolic.

12:18.409 --> 12:20.814
But we'd save money
on electricity.

12:20.848 --> 12:22.250
Not worth me starving.

12:22.284 --> 12:24.254
Less electricity,
less global warming.

12:24.288 --> 12:25.189
- Don't put that on me.

12:25.223 --> 12:27.027
It's not my bank.
<i>[sighs, groans]</i>

12:27.060 --> 12:29.298
- Would you just stop?

12:29.331 --> 12:31.068
- Ow.

12:31.101 --> 12:32.872
Oh, you really love that gun.

12:32.905 --> 12:34.909
I'm old, and I need leverage.

12:34.943 --> 12:37.314
If any of these are turned off
for more than a few seconds,

12:37.347 --> 12:39.318
the master alarm goes off.

12:39.351 --> 12:40.788
Well, that's just...

12:40.821 --> 12:42.290
actually really good to know.

12:42.324 --> 12:44.428
Well, I have to go fill out
some legal forms because--

12:44.461 --> 12:47.400
oh, my God, I just realized
my name is totally stupid.

12:49.505 --> 12:51.041
Did you catch all that?
- Yeah.

12:51.075 --> 12:53.145
You really stuck it to Ray
with the name thing.

12:53.179 --> 12:54.549
You should be nicer to him.

12:54.582 --> 12:56.485
I meant the part about
how if we turn off the alarms,

12:56.519 --> 12:59.257
we're screwed, but I also hear
what you're saying about Ray,

12:59.291 --> 13:01.128
and no.

13:01.161 --> 13:03.165
- Krieger, what happened?

13:03.199 --> 13:04.301
It's all good.

13:04.334 --> 13:06.071
Just injected myself
with a paralytic.

13:06.105 --> 13:07.541
Can't feel nothing now.

13:07.575 --> 13:09.011
You carry that on you?

13:09.044 --> 13:11.081
God, all of this is going
so wrong.

13:11.115 --> 13:12.450
I should just walk out.

13:12.484 --> 13:14.187
No, stupid Pam.

13:14.221 --> 13:16.058
You can't commit to anything.
- Whoa, Pam.

13:16.091 --> 13:17.260
What is going on with you?

13:17.293 --> 13:18.429
Nothing!

13:18.462 --> 13:20.534
I just really wanna go
to brunch.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.039
Hey, turn off your comms.

13:23.072 --> 13:24.174
Is that really it?

13:24.207 --> 13:25.511
You can get brunch
next weekend.

13:25.544 --> 13:27.815
I know a place
that does topless mimosas.

13:27.848 --> 13:30.286
It's bottomless mimosas served
by topless dancers.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.190
I don't wanna have brunch
with you.

13:32.223 --> 13:33.392
Ouch. Why?

13:33.426 --> 13:36.098
I want brunch with... Alessia.

13:36.131 --> 13:38.469
The hot Swiss mercenary lady
who punched me in the face?

13:38.503 --> 13:39.572
Why are you so sad?

13:39.605 --> 13:40.974
She's awesome.

13:41.008 --> 13:42.043
Yeah, we've been dating,

13:42.077 --> 13:44.214
but I think it could be, like,

13:44.247 --> 13:46.285
I don't know, something real?

13:46.318 --> 13:48.623
Holy shit.
Pam in a relationship?

13:48.657 --> 13:51.328
Usually you're all wham-bam
don't-get-attached-ma'am

13:51.362 --> 13:53.199
or sir or them.

13:53.232 --> 13:55.236
I know.
I thought I'd feel trapped,

13:55.269 --> 13:56.606
and I know this sounds dumb,

13:56.639 --> 13:59.144
but I've never felt more free.

13:59.177 --> 14:01.015
Pam, from the bottom
of my heart,

14:01.048 --> 14:03.219
that does sound dumb,
but I'm happy for you.

14:03.252 --> 14:06.125
But now we're actually
trapped in this stupid bank!

14:06.158 --> 14:08.062
I mean, I can't even be on time
for brunch.

14:08.095 --> 14:09.431
She's Swiss, man!

14:09.464 --> 14:11.335
Watches are like gods to them.

14:13.139 --> 14:15.376
Call Alessia.
Push your brunch back an hour.

14:15.410 --> 14:18.149
Here comes the cavalry,
except it's like a cavalry

14:18.182 --> 14:19.451
where the horses are in charge.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.455
That's supposed
to comfort me?

14:21.488 --> 14:24.227
I don't know.
Everything's going fuzzy.

14:24.261 --> 14:25.998
Wow, I thought
this hangover would kill me,

14:26.031 --> 14:27.000
but--

14:27.033 --> 14:28.302
It's way worse than that.

14:28.335 --> 14:29.337
I'm gonna go lie down
for a bit,

14:29.371 --> 14:31.075
then look
for that override code.

14:31.108 --> 14:33.980
Oh, and good luck
with the Alessia thing.

14:35.951 --> 14:37.555
Well, hello, good sir.

14:37.588 --> 14:40.326
A thousand thanks
for letting me in early.

14:40.359 --> 14:43.032
It is I,
an obscenely wealthy socialite,

14:43.065 --> 14:46.405
who wishes to do business
with thine banking shoppe.

14:46.438 --> 14:48.075
Cheerio, spit-spot.

14:48.109 --> 14:50.313
Of course, Ms. Tunt.

14:50.346 --> 14:52.150
God, I hate rich people.

14:52.183 --> 14:53.152
Ready and in position.

14:53.185 --> 14:54.354
Krieger, watch your butt.

14:54.387 --> 14:55.456
I'm going in.

14:55.490 --> 14:56.659
Honestly, if you hit me,

14:56.693 --> 14:58.129
I won't even feel it.

14:58.162 --> 15:01.368
That's funny.
I can feel everything.

15:02.605 --> 15:05.511
Oops... he, uh, said
for no reason.

15:05.544 --> 15:07.447
Lana, Cyril, tell me
you figured something out

15:07.480 --> 15:09.151
so I can just die now.

15:09.184 --> 15:10.521
No dice.
It's right here,

15:10.554 --> 15:12.257
but I can't get
the inner container unlocked.

15:12.290 --> 15:13.994
Will you just grab it?
We'll figure it out later.

15:14.027 --> 15:15.496
What? No. Oh, no.

15:15.531 --> 15:17.300
No one's talking
about grabbing AJ,

15:17.333 --> 15:19.204
uh, unless you think
that kidnapping is an option,

15:19.237 --> 15:21.609
in which case--oh, God damn it.
I lost service again.

15:21.643 --> 15:24.247
Or she didn't want to be
an accessory to kidnapping.

15:24.281 --> 15:26.452
You know, you can come to me
with questions.

15:26.485 --> 15:29.257
I have a law degree.
- Oh, great.

15:29.291 --> 15:30.961
Because I do have
a legal question:

15:30.994 --> 15:33.432
is it against the law to rip
out a coworker's vocal chords

15:33.466 --> 15:36.004
with your bare hands?
- Very much, yes.

15:36.038 --> 15:38.543
Then as my lawyer,
I advise you to stop talking.

15:38.577 --> 15:40.446
Just grab the box!

15:40.480 --> 15:43.018
It's welded in, genius.

15:44.555 --> 15:47.528
Oh, lovely.
This is so Posh Spice.

15:47.561 --> 15:49.431
Yes, yes,
this will do quite nicely

15:49.464 --> 15:51.301
for storing the crown jewels.

15:51.335 --> 15:53.472
Um, of what country?

15:53.507 --> 15:56.178
All of them!

15:56.211 --> 15:59.217
Too many questions.
Bring me someone else.

15:59.251 --> 16:00.654
Pam, it's empty. Go now.

16:02.791 --> 16:04.161
My name's not Pam.

16:05.296 --> 16:06.733
Good to see you again.

16:10.373 --> 16:12.410
- Where have you been, Ray?

16:12.443 --> 16:13.580
Nowhere.

16:13.613 --> 16:15.316
Wow, it can't be that easy.

16:15.349 --> 16:16.553
Freeze right there!

16:16.586 --> 16:18.122
- Never say that.
- You said you were going

16:18.155 --> 16:19.157
to the bathroom.

16:19.191 --> 16:21.261
I lied.
Enough games.

16:21.295 --> 16:22.397
I know you're robbing the bank.

16:22.430 --> 16:24.569
I've known
from the very beginning.

16:26.238 --> 16:28.108
Nice.

16:28.142 --> 16:29.344
Ooh, it was too much fun

16:29.377 --> 16:31.215
watching you guys
fumble around.

16:31.248 --> 16:33.285
Serves these bozos right.

16:33.319 --> 16:34.622
Bring it all down!

16:34.655 --> 16:36.358
You are amazing.
You wouldn't happen to know

16:36.391 --> 16:39.765
if there's booze around here,
would you, Suz?

16:42.070 --> 16:44.140
Well, at least they have
good security on the booze.

16:44.174 --> 16:45.443
Heads up, Ray.

16:45.476 --> 16:47.715
Override code 64245.

16:47.748 --> 16:49.217
- Yes.

16:49.251 --> 16:51.188
Wait, is this it?

16:51.221 --> 16:53.259
You are one gorgeous weirdo.

16:53.292 --> 16:55.062
Thanks.
One more thing.

16:55.096 --> 16:56.164
You guys have to rough me up.

16:56.198 --> 16:57.535
Make it look good.

16:57.568 --> 16:59.572
I--I don't think
I can do that.

16:59.605 --> 17:02.176
Pussy.

17:02.210 --> 17:03.680
Get the hell out of here.

17:03.713 --> 17:05.049
We owe you dinner!

17:05.082 --> 17:06.753
I heard threesome.

17:08.455 --> 17:11.395
See? I told you
everything would work out.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.438
Oh, shit.

17:16.471 --> 17:18.643
I think it's pronounced
"SWAT."

17:22.818 --> 17:24.822
Breach the door!
Go, go, go, go, go!

17:24.855 --> 17:27.227
- Who the hell tipped them off?

17:27.260 --> 17:28.295
No time to think about that.

17:28.329 --> 17:31.101
Leadership! Upstairs!

17:36.144 --> 17:37.648
That's not gonna hurt
until tomorrow.

17:39.351 --> 17:41.556
Ow, okay.
Turns out face shots hurt now.

17:43.158 --> 17:45.396
Oh, God, Tom, sorry.

17:45.429 --> 17:46.833
Good luck with the ska band.

17:46.866 --> 17:49.271
Whoo.

17:49.304 --> 17:50.273
police officer:
Grenade!

17:56.586 --> 17:57.721
Where to now?

17:57.755 --> 18:00.426
As leader,
I am open to suggestions.

18:00.459 --> 18:02.831
I am not getting arrested
before my custody hearing.

18:02.865 --> 18:04.802
Cheryl, do you have
any more explosives?

18:04.835 --> 18:06.873
Duh, it's the only thing
in here.

18:06.906 --> 18:08.543
Even the tampons are bombs.

18:08.576 --> 18:10.881
I like when my periods
feel dangerous.

18:11.883 --> 18:13.720
Oh, hey, Alessia.

18:13.753 --> 18:17.828
So it, uh, turns out I might
need to push our brunch back

18:17.861 --> 18:22.671
just a bit more,
like maybe 15 to 20 years.

18:22.705 --> 18:23.840
Pam, cut the shit.

18:23.873 --> 18:25.611
I know you're inside the bank.

18:25.644 --> 18:27.280
Don't worry about it, baby.

18:27.313 --> 18:28.683
I'm out back
with the getaway truck.

18:28.717 --> 18:30.587
Wait, really?
How did you know?

18:30.621 --> 18:32.423
You sounded freaked out
on the phone,

18:32.457 --> 18:33.827
so I traced
your team's movements.

18:33.860 --> 18:35.697
Did it feel weird
and stalker-y?

18:35.731 --> 18:38.603
Yeah, but that's
every American rom-com.

18:38.637 --> 18:39.839
It really is.

18:39.872 --> 18:41.341
Hey, good news, guys!

18:41.375 --> 18:44.381
My, uh, special friend
is out back with wheels.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.184
Special friend?
What did I tell you

18:46.218 --> 18:47.621
about fear of commitment?

18:49.892 --> 18:52.230
Cheryl, if you got something,
now's the time.

18:52.263 --> 18:53.867
Take it easy. I've got this.

18:56.405 --> 18:58.442
And now... we begin.

19:12.771 --> 19:14.608
Well, fun while it lasted.

19:14.642 --> 19:16.746
Step aside. I've got this.

19:16.779 --> 19:18.783
- Who the hell are you?

19:18.817 --> 19:20.386
I've been taking
night classes.

19:20.419 --> 19:23.292
Junior colleges
are surprisingly comprehensive.

19:24.662 --> 19:26.833
Well, this is how we die.
Relax.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.505
You will all die years
from now, safe in your beds,

19:29.538 --> 19:31.676
never suspecting I'm waiting
in the shadows.

19:31.709 --> 19:32.611
Clear!

19:37.286 --> 19:39.491
- Jump!
- From all the way up here?

19:39.525 --> 19:40.894
Sometimes you gotta
take the leap.

19:40.927 --> 19:43.232
Aah!

19:45.604 --> 19:47.407
Uh, aah.

19:49.678 --> 19:50.781
Aah!

19:50.814 --> 19:53.285
- And she can bake?

19:53.318 --> 19:55.924
Good God, I love this woman.

19:55.957 --> 19:57.795
Wow, just blurting it out, huh?

19:57.828 --> 19:59.799
Well, I stole the truck
with the pastries

19:59.832 --> 20:02.638
and replaced the roof,
but did you just say...

20:02.671 --> 20:03.840
Go!

20:03.873 --> 20:04.975
Faster!

20:05.009 --> 20:06.646
They're on our asses!

20:06.679 --> 20:09.518
Duh, that's why I planted
all those extra bombs.

20:15.597 --> 20:18.937
So hey, about what you said
back there, the L word--

20:18.970 --> 20:21.408
L word? Yeah,
you must have misheard me.

20:21.441 --> 20:22.945
I don't think I've ever used
any words

20:22.978 --> 20:25.416
that have that letter in them
at all ever.

20:25.449 --> 20:26.819
Pam,
that's such a stupid lie.

20:26.853 --> 20:28.590
Your full name is Pamela.

20:28.623 --> 20:30.961
Come on, just ask her
to be your girlfriend already.

20:30.994 --> 20:33.833
Girlfriend? Ew. No.

20:33.867 --> 20:37.407
Alessia, will you be
my polyamorous primary?

20:37.440 --> 20:38.710
Yes!

20:38.743 --> 20:40.814
Just give me 4.2 seconds.

20:40.847 --> 20:42.417
Klaus?

20:42.450 --> 20:43.953
You're down to secondary.

20:43.987 --> 20:45.590
Ugh, don't be a baby.

20:45.624 --> 20:47.828
And call Esmeralda
and knock her down to three.

20:47.861 --> 20:49.965
And now you're mine as well.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.836
Aw, you guys.

20:51.869 --> 20:53.840
You know, I am partially
responsible for--

20:53.873 --> 20:55.977
- No.
- Fabian must've sold us out

20:56.011 --> 20:58.382
to the cops.
- Now let's not rush to judg--

20:58.415 --> 21:00.319
No, let's do rush
to judgment.

21:00.352 --> 21:01.722
Fabian sold us out.

21:01.756 --> 21:03.993
It's not like anyone
accidentally pushed

21:04.027 --> 21:05.864
a secret alarm or anything.

21:05.897 --> 21:07.801
The whole mission
was probably bullshit.

21:07.835 --> 21:08.870
This is just a bunch
of pictures

21:08.903 --> 21:10.707
with some random woman.

21:13.680 --> 21:15.015
You're late.

21:15.049 --> 21:17.019
Yeah, well,
someone was apparently

21:17.053 --> 21:18.723
pretty determined
to get in our way.

21:18.756 --> 21:19.992
Come on, Fabian.
Let's hear it.

21:20.025 --> 21:21.863
What's your inevitable
double cross?

21:21.896 --> 21:24.067
No, double cross.
I'm a man of my word.

21:24.100 --> 21:26.606
The agency is yours again.

21:26.639 --> 21:29.612
And in fact, I'm pleased
it all worked out this way.

21:29.645 --> 21:31.348
I've come to respect--

21:31.381 --> 21:32.651
Suck it, asshole!

21:32.684 --> 21:35.891
Alessia, punch it!

21:35.924 --> 21:37.895
Nice working with you too.

21:40.834 --> 21:42.938
Here's to me being right.

21:42.971 --> 21:45.476
Complete and utter victory.
- Was it, though?

21:45.510 --> 21:47.480
I freaking crushed it
back there.

21:47.514 --> 21:49.618
Or should I say blasted it?

21:49.652 --> 21:51.421
No, that sounds
like something gross.

21:51.454 --> 21:53.058
Guys, you won't believe this.

21:53.091 --> 21:54.762
anchor: Chaos
in the Latin American country

21:54.795 --> 21:56.031
of Manatina tonight

21:56.064 --> 21:58.770
as the prime minister
has declared martial law.

21:58.803 --> 22:00.774
Uh, does it seem
like a coincidence

22:00.807 --> 22:02.511
that's where
I tripped over a tapir

22:02.544 --> 22:03.913
and got snakebit in the face?

22:03.947 --> 22:06.786
Oh, God.
Still funny.

22:06.819 --> 22:09.390
You were so almost gonna die.

22:09.424 --> 22:11.529
Borders are closed,
and citizens have been confined

22:11.562 --> 22:13.933
to their homes.
This sudden authoritarian turn

22:13.967 --> 22:16.371
is especially shocking
given that the prime minister

22:16.404 --> 22:18.643
has, until now,
been highly progressive,

22:18.676 --> 22:21.516
turning Manatina into a model
for social change.

22:21.549 --> 22:24.120
Wait, did we just
blackmail a president?

22:24.153 --> 22:26.592
Thereby causing
a geopolitical incident?

22:26.626 --> 22:29.097
Well, that definitely won't
look good in family court.

22:29.130 --> 22:31.536
Well, here's something
that looks even worse.

22:31.569 --> 22:33.940
This contract
is backdated six months.

22:33.973 --> 22:37.079
So Fabian and IIA didn't rob
that bank?

22:37.113 --> 22:39.417
Or all that other stuff
he had us do.

22:39.450 --> 22:41.956
We did.

22:41.989 --> 22:44.828
Easy peasy.

23:03.666 --> 23:06.939
Made in Georgia.
