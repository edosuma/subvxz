00:02.602 --> 00:03.637
[crowd cheering]

00:05.539 --> 00:08.109
[***]

00:08.141 --> 00:09.043
[female commentator]:
On the ice now

00:09.077 --> 00:10.111
is Claire Benson,

00:10.144 --> 00:13.514
who hopes her last three years
with Julian King,

00:13.547 --> 00:16.216
who has a flawless record
for coaching champions,

00:16.250 --> 00:18.719
will cinch her
that gold medal today.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.421
[***]

00:24.692 --> 00:28.296
[***]

00:35.169 --> 00:37.037
[crowd cheering]

00:43.344 --> 00:46.747
[***]

00:49.383 --> 00:51.452
[crowd cheering]

00:51.485 --> 00:52.620
Well, it seems Claire
has gotten the crowd

00:52.653 --> 00:54.522
into a festive spirit.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.157
[male commentator]:
And why not?

00:56.190 --> 00:58.192
The energy and emotion
she has brought to the ice

00:58.226 --> 01:00.228
is incredible.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.696
If she can land her triple axel,
she may take that gold.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.069
[female commentator]:
And she's setting it up...

01:12.506 --> 01:13.874
Oh, no!

01:13.907 --> 01:16.610
A devastating technical error
for Claire Benson.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.815
Looks like it will be silver
for Claire Benson tonight.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.584
[applause]

01:26.754 --> 01:30.791
[***]

01:34.928 --> 01:39.367
[***]

01:45.773 --> 01:50.544
[***]

02:02.790 --> 02:07.228
[***]

02:11.732 --> 02:13.234
Oh, great,
there you are.

02:13.267 --> 02:16.370
Okay, uh, which one do you think
for the front door?

02:16.404 --> 02:17.871
Um...

02:17.905 --> 02:18.939
that one.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.341
Oh, yeah, I thought so, too.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.609
Okay,

02:21.642 --> 02:22.676
about a Christmas tree?

02:22.710 --> 02:23.777
Um, wanna go this weekend?

02:23.811 --> 02:25.713
I have to train this weekend.

02:27.315 --> 02:28.782
Uh, so I guess that means

02:28.816 --> 02:31.485
you forgot
the Stuart Christmas brunch?

02:31.519 --> 02:33.454
Mom, Nationals are just
a few weeks away,

02:33.487 --> 02:35.389
before Christmas.

02:35.423 --> 02:38.292
Baby, you never stop.

02:38.326 --> 02:40.228
Mom, I am fine.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.632
And Julian's just trying to
get me to where I want to go.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.500
That's why dad hired him.

02:46.534 --> 02:47.435
Yeah, well, your dad
pushed too hard, too.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.769
Maybe if he hadn't,
he'd still be here.

02:51.972 --> 02:55.209
Look, if you want, we can go
and get a tree this weekend.

02:55.243 --> 02:57.978
Oh, sweetie,
that's not the point.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.314
Claire, when is the last time
you went out with a friend?

03:00.348 --> 03:01.349
Mom...

03:01.382 --> 03:02.350
I'm just saying.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.917
There may come a day

03:03.951 --> 03:05.719
when you regret not having
lived more life

03:05.753 --> 03:06.820
outside the arena.

03:07.988 --> 03:11.292
Look, the only thing
I will regret

03:11.325 --> 03:13.627
is never making it
to Worlds.

03:13.661 --> 03:14.995
I'm gonna go shower.

03:15.028 --> 03:18.198
[***]

03:20.701 --> 03:22.370
Toe, Claire, toe! Toe!

03:22.403 --> 03:24.372
Bring those arms in, come on!

03:25.773 --> 03:27.007
Compress, Claire!

03:27.040 --> 03:29.209
Come on!

03:31.612 --> 03:32.746
Let's go!

03:32.780 --> 03:34.248
Focus!

03:34.282 --> 03:35.316
Again!

03:35.349 --> 03:36.317
Arms in tight now!

03:36.350 --> 03:37.718
Claire, get over here.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.753
You've got to keep
that energy

03:39.787 --> 03:40.854
into it, okay?

03:40.888 --> 03:42.456
You're slowing it down,
all right?

03:42.490 --> 03:44.024
You've got to keep
the energy going!

03:44.057 --> 03:46.294
What is wrong with you?
You're distracted, or--

03:46.327 --> 03:48.396
I'm frustrated because
I'm not nailing the jump.

03:48.429 --> 03:49.863
Hey, what do I always say?

03:49.897 --> 03:51.999
[sighs heavily]

03:52.032 --> 03:53.501
"Don't get frustrated,
get focused."

03:53.534 --> 03:54.468
Right.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.704
I know, but I can't have
a repeat performance

03:56.737 --> 03:58.439
at Nationals in four weeks.

03:58.472 --> 03:59.540
Claire, we made a promise
to one another

03:59.573 --> 04:00.508
after last Nationals.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.311
What was it?

04:03.344 --> 04:04.878
I promised
that I wouldn't give up.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.980
Mm-hmm.

04:07.014 --> 04:09.016
And I promised
I'd get you to Worlds.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.684
Now, let's go.

04:11.752 --> 04:12.686
Again.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.757
All right.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.295
Toe, Claire! Toe!

04:21.329 --> 04:22.630
What did I say?

04:22.663 --> 04:25.399
Get up, let's go again.
Come on.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.668
It's colder sitting down,
than it is skating.

04:29.703 --> 04:32.039
I don't think I can.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.541
Well, the good news is

04:33.574 --> 04:36.043
there's no sign of any
fractures or sprains.

04:36.076 --> 04:36.910
The bad news is

04:36.944 --> 04:38.979
your Achilles is
in pretty rough shape.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.448
What are we
talking about here?

04:40.481 --> 04:41.882
A sprain or a tear?

04:41.915 --> 04:44.918
Most likely a tear,
which isn't surprising.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.354
I mean, Claire,
you and I both know

04:46.387 --> 04:47.588
that you've been
dealing with tendonitis

04:47.621 --> 04:49.089
for quite
some time now.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.358
We've been supporting
those injuries with cortisone--

04:50.391 --> 04:52.059
What's the recovery time?

04:52.092 --> 04:54.328
Four, six weeks.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.663
I barely feel it when I walk.

04:55.696 --> 04:56.997
How bad can it be?

04:57.030 --> 04:58.599
Come on, Claire,

04:58.632 --> 05:00.067
you know, just because
you don't feel it

05:00.100 --> 05:02.035
doesn't mean
you should stress it.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.070
Which is why rest,
and a lot of--

05:03.103 --> 05:04.372
Um...

05:04.405 --> 05:05.439
Thank you very much, doctor.

05:05.473 --> 05:06.940
Would you mind if we just
had a few moments here?

05:11.479 --> 05:12.580
Yeah.

05:12.613 --> 05:13.581
Thank you.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.351
I'm going to have
your medical records

05:17.385 --> 05:18.452
sent to West Ridge
Rehab, okay?

05:18.486 --> 05:19.787
You can fly out in the morning.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.555
What?

05:21.589 --> 05:23.957
That's all the way up
in the mountains.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.058
I don't need
to go up there.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.060
I love your
commitment, Claire,

05:27.094 --> 05:28.929
but we need you
in top form for Nationals,

05:28.962 --> 05:30.831
and West Ridge has the best
accelerated program

05:30.864 --> 05:31.799
in the country, okay?

05:31.832 --> 05:34.468
Trust me, we'll have you
back in a few weeks.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.637
[sighs heavily]

05:38.539 --> 05:40.073
Well, Julian, it's no secret

05:40.107 --> 05:41.241
that you have an unbroken record

05:41.274 --> 05:43.377
for getting your skaters
to the World Championship.

05:43.411 --> 05:44.878
Is Claire
any different?

05:44.912 --> 05:46.880
Absolutely not. In fact,
I'll promise you

05:46.914 --> 05:49.082
not only will Claire
make it to Worlds,

05:49.116 --> 05:51.819
she'll get gold
at Nationals.

05:51.852 --> 05:52.653
[interviewer]: Well, that
certainly puts a lot of pressure

05:52.686 --> 05:53.921
on you, Claire.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.490
[Julian]: Don't worry,
my girl will do it.

06:00.027 --> 06:04.465
[***]

06:04.498 --> 06:05.699
[driver]: We should be
at the West Ridge Clinic

06:05.733 --> 06:07.067
in about 20 minutes.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.769
Enjoy the scenery.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.604
[Claire]: Okay, thanks.

06:18.579 --> 06:19.447
[driver]:
These roads are terrible.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.514
Hang tight.

06:20.548 --> 06:21.782
[tires squealing and skidding]

06:26.820 --> 06:28.088
[tires spinning]

06:28.121 --> 06:29.423
What's going on?

06:29.457 --> 06:30.658
The road's aren't clear.

06:30.691 --> 06:32.025
We could be stuck.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.961
Stuck?

06:57.618 --> 06:58.552
You got any chains?

06:58.586 --> 07:00.087
Excuse me.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.723
Nope, no chains.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.658
Could you help us
get back on the road, please?

07:04.692 --> 07:07.661
There's nothing I can do,
not without chains.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.697
You'll have to
wait for a tow.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.231
I can barely get a signal
on my phone up here.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.133
Um...

07:13.166 --> 07:16.870
I can call it in
when I get back to town.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.639
Okay, great.
How long will that take?

07:18.672 --> 07:20.240
Could be 45
minutes, an hour,

07:20.273 --> 07:22.743
and that's assuming
he's not on another job.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.778
There's one tow truck?

07:24.812 --> 07:26.013
Yeah.
Yeah, Joey's your man.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.081
[sighs]
This is ridiculous.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.918
[muttering] Stuck
in the middle of nowhere...

07:39.560 --> 07:42.663
How far is it to
the West Ridge Rehab Clinic?

07:42.696 --> 07:43.931
It's 20 minutes
by foot,

07:43.964 --> 07:44.932
but I wouldn't
recommend it,

07:44.965 --> 07:47.535
not in those
Peter Pan boots.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.603
I can give you
a lift.

07:49.637 --> 07:51.171
I'll be fine, thank you.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.208
Careful of the wolves!

08:00.781 --> 08:01.849
[wolves howling]

08:18.966 --> 08:20.568
You sure you don't want a lift?

08:22.002 --> 08:23.070
Okay, sure,

08:23.103 --> 08:25.839
but if I didn't have
all these bags, I would be fine.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.742
[chuckles] Yeah, right.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.154
You, uh, you need a hand
with your luggage?

08:41.188 --> 08:43.557
This is fine.
Thanks. I can manage.

08:44.692 --> 08:47.127
I'll put that call in to Joey.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.328
Great.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.597
Thank you, um...

08:49.630 --> 08:51.131
Luke.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.165
Luke.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.166
And you are...

08:53.200 --> 08:54.167
Claire.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.302
Claire.

08:55.335 --> 08:56.336
Well, Claire,

08:56.369 --> 08:58.806
welcome to West Ridge.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.074
Thanks.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.789
Welcome to
West Ridge.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.357
We have a room
all ready for you

09:17.390 --> 09:18.626
so you can warm up.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.961
Um, when can I see a doctor?

09:20.994 --> 09:22.996
Oh, let's see,

09:23.030 --> 09:25.265
your first physio
appointment

09:25.298 --> 09:27.334
is at 10:00 a.m.
tomorrow morning.

09:27.367 --> 09:30.003
Oh, um...
can't I see someone now?

09:30.037 --> 09:31.772
Oh no,
it's after 4:00.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.007
Time for rest and recovery.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.629
Hot cider?

09:55.663 --> 09:58.699
Oh...

09:58.732 --> 10:00.701
um, why not?

10:00.734 --> 10:02.002
Thanks.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.218
[engine approaching]

10:36.236 --> 10:37.805
You all settled in?

10:37.838 --> 10:40.207
Yeah. I guess.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.276
Yeah, well, uh, Joey made sure

10:43.310 --> 10:45.145
that your ride made it back down
the mountain in one piece.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.414
Right.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.817
Thanks for helping me out
with that.

10:49.850 --> 10:50.784
That's what we do
around here,

10:50.818 --> 10:51.852
we help each other out.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.854
Then how come
I end up

10:53.887 --> 10:55.422
doing all
the heavy lifting?

10:55.455 --> 10:57.057
Claire, this is
my good friend, Lou.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.359
Luke and Lou?

10:59.392 --> 11:00.761
That's cute.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.864
Ah... Peter Pan boots.

11:03.897 --> 11:07.968
I just wasn't prepared
for all this snow.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.036
Ah, don't
worry about it,

11:09.069 --> 11:10.203
most city folk aren't.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.038
Well, we should get going.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.239
We've got a lot more
wood to deliver.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.406
Well, thanks for all this.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.909
Hey, what are
gentlemen for?

11:15.943 --> 11:19.012
Tell you what,

11:19.046 --> 11:20.447
use up as much as you like,

11:20.480 --> 11:21.414
and don't burn it all
in one place.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.851
[chuckles]

11:23.884 --> 11:24.918
Okay. Good night.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.358
Keep warm.

11:31.391 --> 11:32.459
Thanks.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.043
[distant explosion]

11:50.077 --> 11:51.711
[gasps]

11:57.417 --> 11:58.485
[distant explosions]

12:03.290 --> 12:04.792
Oh!

12:04.825 --> 12:06.459
Welcome back, Ms. Benson.
How was your run?

12:06.493 --> 12:09.229
It was fine, thanks,
except for those explosions.

12:09.262 --> 12:10.163
What was that?

12:10.197 --> 12:12.265
Oh, those are just
the charges they set off

12:12.299 --> 12:13.433
to prevent an avalanche.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.268
Avalanche?

12:15.302 --> 12:16.303
Don't worry.

12:16.336 --> 12:17.771
We haven't had one.

12:17.805 --> 12:18.972
Not recently anyhow.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.342
Okay.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.412
Your tendons are
suffering with micro-tears,

12:25.445 --> 12:26.814
and not just
in the Achilles,

12:26.847 --> 12:30.283
but in the posterior
and anterior tibial.

12:30.317 --> 12:31.785
Have you been treated with
cortisone in the past?

12:31.819 --> 12:33.553
I have to compete.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.189
Well, unfortunately,

12:36.223 --> 12:37.390
the muscles
have been weakened,

12:37.424 --> 12:38.491
and that's why

12:38.525 --> 12:40.060
you're getting
these injuries.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.161
But I feel strong.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.129
Do you?

12:44.064 --> 12:47.835
I have to be in top form
for Nationals.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.336
Well, we'll start with
a combined program

12:49.369 --> 12:51.238
of IMS,
shock wave therapy,

12:51.271 --> 12:52.439
the traditional physio,

12:52.472 --> 12:53.807
and my favorite, rest.

12:54.942 --> 12:55.943
But if you bind it,

12:55.976 --> 12:57.110
I can still
skate, right?

12:57.144 --> 12:58.178
You can.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.080
But absolutely
no jumps.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.048
For what, a week?

13:01.081 --> 13:02.049
Four.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.218
Four.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.419
They said it'll be four weeks

13:06.453 --> 13:08.521
before I can even
work on my jump.

13:08.555 --> 13:09.957
Four weeks?
Well, that's impossible.

13:09.990 --> 13:10.924
The Nationals are in four weeks.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.025
I know.

13:12.059 --> 13:14.194
[whispering] I told you
I shouldn't have come here.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.963
Anna, from your toe!

13:15.996 --> 13:18.198
Lift from your toe!

13:18.231 --> 13:20.267
Who's Anna?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.969
Just a junior skater
I'm assessing.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.871
Anna Wolk?

13:23.904 --> 13:25.839
Isn't she my competition?

13:25.873 --> 13:26.940
I'm not training her, Claire.

13:26.974 --> 13:27.941
Listen, you obviously need

13:27.975 --> 13:28.976
to get back on the ice,

13:29.009 --> 13:29.877
so I'm going to talk
to your doctor, all right?

13:29.910 --> 13:32.479
Claire, remember,
you're strong, okay?

13:32.512 --> 13:35.415
You can push through this.

13:41.621 --> 13:43.090
Have you been
down on the lake

13:43.123 --> 13:44.224
checking out
the ice lately?

13:44.257 --> 13:46.593
Yeah, I was just clearing off
the snow this morning.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.395
Still too thin in spots
for any fishing,

13:48.428 --> 13:49.562
but that cold snap
we're getting

13:49.596 --> 13:50.964
should have it set
in a couple days.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.265
Don't you worry.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.600
Excuse me, Luke?

13:53.633 --> 13:54.634
Oh, hey, Claire.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.370
Hey, do you know, um--

13:57.404 --> 13:58.371
What do you think?

13:58.405 --> 13:59.306
Pretty festive, right?

14:01.041 --> 14:03.210
Yeah, it's, um, really nice.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.112
Do you know where I could get
a pair of skates sharpened?

14:05.145 --> 14:07.014
Yeah, uh, at the Tack Shack,

14:07.047 --> 14:08.548
just across
the square there.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.017
Oh, perfect.
Thank you.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.218
You're welcome.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.256
What?
Cut it out.

14:18.658 --> 14:22.195
[***]

14:25.098 --> 14:26.499
Hello?

14:28.135 --> 14:29.903
[sighs] Great.

14:29.937 --> 14:32.005
I guess Joey runs
this place, too.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.378
[shop bell rings]

14:38.411 --> 14:39.412
Oh, it's you.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.114
You're everywhere.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.515
I was hoping it was
whoever owns this place.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.985
I mean, how do they expect us
to wait for 20 minutes?

14:45.018 --> 14:47.020
Well, sometimes, you've
gotta put things on hold

14:47.054 --> 14:48.488
to give a hand.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.523
'Tis the season after all.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.025
It's your shop?

14:52.059 --> 14:53.093
How can I help you?

14:53.126 --> 14:55.328
I, uh, didn't realize...

14:55.362 --> 14:56.629
That's all right.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.131
I get it.

14:58.165 --> 14:59.599
You city folk
don't like to wait.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.070
Now, how about
those skates?

15:03.103 --> 15:05.172
They could use a sharpening,

15:05.205 --> 15:06.239
but I doubt you know
the correct hollow radius.

15:06.273 --> 15:09.642
I'm guessing you'd prefer
a three-eighths radius

15:09.676 --> 15:11.311
rather than
a thicker one.

15:11.344 --> 15:12.512
Am I right?

15:12.545 --> 15:16.016
Um, yeah, that's right.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.218
Okay, I'll make sure
they're nice and level.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.187
So, how did you
injure yourself?

15:20.220 --> 15:22.322
I fell while training.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.556
Figure skater, huh?

15:23.590 --> 15:26.326
Lucky guess.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.628
And what are you,
like the town handyman?

15:28.661 --> 15:31.164
Why would you say that?

15:31.198 --> 15:34.601
Well, so far you deliver wood,
put up decorations,

15:34.634 --> 15:36.003
and sharpen skates.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.637
[laughs]

15:37.670 --> 15:38.972
All right, I get it.

15:39.006 --> 15:39.939
Well, to be honest,

15:39.973 --> 15:41.641
I didn't have much time
for anything before,

15:41.674 --> 15:43.176
so now maybe
I'm making up for that.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.013
So, I guess
you'd be the guy to ask

15:46.046 --> 15:47.680
if there's
a skating rink nearby?

15:47.714 --> 15:49.316
Are you looking
for an indoor rink?

15:49.349 --> 15:51.518
'Cause that closed down
a couple years ago.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.254
There's
an outdoor one, though.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.655
It's nothing fancy,
but it's ice,

15:55.688 --> 15:57.357
and everyone skates on it.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.258
And would the shuttle know
where to drop me off?

15:58.291 --> 16:00.327
Yeah, sure,
it's right by the clinic.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.029
But it's closed today.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.164
Closed? Why?

16:04.197 --> 16:06.166
Oh, the Pattersons booked it

16:06.199 --> 16:07.167
for their son's
birthday party.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.270
The whole rink is closed
for a kids' birthday?

16:10.303 --> 16:12.205
Yeah, that's right.

16:15.575 --> 16:16.676
Well, that should do it.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.114
There you go,
give them a feel.

16:23.250 --> 16:27.454
Wow, I think you got these
sharper than back home.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.322
So, what do I owe you?

16:29.356 --> 16:31.291
Ah, first one's on the house.

16:31.324 --> 16:34.727
Plus, I did
make you wait.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.129
Thanks.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.464
Mm-hmm.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.132
Have fun.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.338
[***]

16:49.309 --> 16:51.511
Is that a lake?

16:51.544 --> 16:53.780
Excuse me, could you just
let me off here?

16:56.449 --> 16:58.285
Thanks.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.268
[sighs happily]

17:15.301 --> 17:16.435
Perfect.

17:18.570 --> 17:19.506
[shop bell jingles]

17:19.539 --> 17:20.839
Yup, yup!

17:20.873 --> 17:22.608
Hey, Lou.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.211
Thanks for covering
for me today.

17:24.243 --> 17:25.145
No problem.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.146
I know if you don't
get that tree today,

17:27.180 --> 17:28.448
you'll be in trouble
with the little miss.

17:28.481 --> 17:29.482
Yeah, you know it.

17:29.516 --> 17:30.383
Stop by later for dinner?

17:30.417 --> 17:32.385
I wouldn't pass up
a home-cooked meal.

17:32.419 --> 17:33.520
Great.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.521
-I'll see you tonight.
-You got it.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.170
Hmm... feels solid.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.785
Thanks again, Phil.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.587
We'll see you later?

18:07.620 --> 18:08.621
Yep.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.699
[wincing]

18:24.571 --> 18:26.273
You have got to be kidding me.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.645
Hey!

18:32.679 --> 18:33.813
Hey, Hi!ire!

18:33.846 --> 18:35.215
Get off the ice!

18:35.248 --> 18:36.316
[laughing] Why?

18:36.349 --> 18:37.550
Because it's not safe!

18:37.584 --> 18:38.818
It's totally fine!

[cracking]

18:41.754 --> 18:42.689
Oh, no.

18:44.524 --> 18:45.458
It's breaking!

18:45.492 --> 18:46.693
Stay there, stay right there,
don't move,

18:46.726 --> 18:48.161
I'm coming to you.

18:48.195 --> 18:49.229
Luke, hurry!

18:49.262 --> 18:50.830
Stay right there,
do not move.

18:50.863 --> 18:51.831
What do I do?

18:51.864 --> 18:52.799
Just stay put.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.534
Look at me, look at me.
Just look up at me.

18:54.567 --> 18:55.735
-I'm coming as fast as I can.
-Hurry up!

18:55.768 --> 18:58.438
-Take my hands...
-Okay.

18:58.471 --> 18:59.539
And don't let go.

18:59.572 --> 19:00.807
Okay.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.242
I got you.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.276
Okay?

19:03.310 --> 19:04.911
Come with me.

19:06.579 --> 19:07.647
Slow. Steady.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.518
Okay. All right.

19:11.551 --> 19:12.652
Now here we go, okay?

19:12.685 --> 19:13.586
[ice cracking]

19:19.759 --> 19:20.693
Is your foot frozen?

19:20.727 --> 19:21.694
Yeah.

19:23.763 --> 19:24.931
That was a close one.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.575
So, what
were you thinking?

19:35.608 --> 19:36.643
The rink was closed.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.678
I mean, who closes
an entire rink

19:38.711 --> 19:39.779
for a children's
birthday party?

19:39.812 --> 19:41.314
Claire...

19:41.348 --> 19:42.282
did you not read the sign?

19:42.315 --> 19:43.550
What sign?

19:45.285 --> 19:46.219
Of course,

19:46.253 --> 19:47.220
because who would look
for the danger sign?

19:47.254 --> 19:49.289
Why don't they put it
where people can see it?

19:49.322 --> 19:52.292
Because most people up here
know where to look for it.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.961
Okay, well, obviously,
I've been enough trouble,

19:54.994 --> 19:56.563
so I'm just going to
call the clinic.

No, no, let's get you
some dry clothes.

right there.

I'll just get you
some dry clothes.

Hey, sweetie.
How was the skating party?

21:09.869 --> 21:11.003
Fun.

We got candy canes
in our loot bags.

What is Claire Benson
doing here?

Duh, Dad.

figure skater.

[chuckles]

21:26.819 --> 21:28.054
No, not really.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.922
Then what are you doing?

21:29.956 --> 21:31.958
I am just staying
at the rehab clinic.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.926
Did you hurt yourself?

21:33.960 --> 21:35.828
Yeah, kind of.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.564
Can you still skate?

21:37.597 --> 21:38.898
Sure.

21:38.931 --> 21:41.501
You know, you're
a lot prettier in real life.

21:41.534 --> 21:42.669
Did you bring
any skating costumes?

21:42.702 --> 21:43.770
Um...

21:43.803 --> 21:44.737
Okay, stop
interrogating our guest.

21:44.771 --> 21:45.805
Let's get washed up

21:45.838 --> 21:47.974
so we can start
decorating, okay?

21:48.007 --> 21:50.577
Can you make hot chocolate?

21:50.610 --> 21:52.712
Of course.
It's tradition.

Now, go on.

all the questions.

Uh, here.

pants and socks.

but they're dry.

23:09.656 --> 23:10.590
Beautiful.

23:11.958 --> 23:12.959
Do you want to help?

23:12.992 --> 23:14.827
Uh... no, I actually
probably--

23:14.861 --> 23:15.862
[door slams]

23:15.895 --> 23:17.464
Ho! Ho! Ho!

23:17.497 --> 23:18.431
Uncle Lou!

23:20.867 --> 23:22.435
How's my
little angel?

23:22.469 --> 23:24.737
Look. Claire says
she's beautiful.

23:24.771 --> 23:25.805
Ooh.

23:25.838 --> 23:28.475
Well, that it is, Luke.

23:28.508 --> 23:30.109
You found yourself
a real looker out there.

23:34.547 --> 23:37.517
The tree, I meant.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.519
Yeah, yeah, Claire,
she just needed some help

23:39.552 --> 23:40.687
off the ice
on Fraser Lake.

23:40.720 --> 23:41.954
Wait a minute,

23:41.988 --> 23:43.556
you were out on the lake?

23:43.590 --> 23:44.691
Claire's a figure skater.

23:44.724 --> 23:47.794
You know, I don't care
if she's the sugar plum fairy,

23:47.827 --> 23:49.562
no one goes out on the ice yet.

23:49.596 --> 23:50.863
Didn't you
warn her?

23:50.897 --> 23:51.898
There is a sign.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.600
Luke.
Come on, man,

23:53.633 --> 23:54.801
no one reads
the signs.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.869
Exactly.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.170
Chamonix, why don't
you and uncle Lou

23:58.204 --> 23:59.171
get going on the tree,

23:59.205 --> 24:00.573
and I'll start dinner?

24:00.607 --> 24:02.475
Claire, will you
be joining us?

24:02.509 --> 24:04.043
Oh, um, no, thank you.

24:04.076 --> 24:04.844
I should get back and train.

24:04.877 --> 24:06.646
Okay, I'll give you
a ride back.

24:06.679 --> 24:09.716
Really, I've been
more than enough trouble.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.117
I've got to drop
an invoice off at the clinic.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.919
It's no trouble.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.555
-Hey, Lou, I'll be right back.
-We'll be here.

24:15.588 --> 24:17.223
It was nice
to meet you, Chamonix.

24:17.256 --> 24:18.991
Bye, Claire.
I hope you get better.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.459
Thanks.

24:22.862 --> 24:25.131
Okay, so, let's
try and find

24:25.164 --> 24:28.735
those other tangled
balls of lights,

24:28.768 --> 24:29.869
shall we?

24:29.902 --> 24:31.804
[groaning]

24:34.574 --> 24:36.809
It's a shame
we missed the sunset.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.745
They're really
something up here.

24:38.778 --> 24:39.746
[chuckles]

24:39.779 --> 24:40.747
They sure are.

24:40.780 --> 24:41.881
Ms. Benson.

24:41.914 --> 24:43.816
And Luke,
always a pleasure

24:43.850 --> 24:44.917
to see our most
eligible bachelor

24:44.951 --> 24:46.786
this side of the mountain.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.120
It's nice
to see you, Patty.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.556
Hey, could you pass along
this invoice

24:49.589 --> 24:51.157
for the firewood, please?

24:51.190 --> 24:52.792
Anything for you, handsome.

24:55.728 --> 25:01.233
So... you're a famous
figure skater, huh?

25:01.267 --> 25:04.971
And you're a professional hockey
player, huh?

25:05.004 --> 25:08.708
[chuckles] I saw
the picture at your place.

25:08.741 --> 25:11.077
So, who do you
play for?

25:11.110 --> 25:13.012
No, I don't actually
play anymore.

25:13.045 --> 25:16.649
No, now I'm just a dad
and the local handyman.

25:16.683 --> 25:17.817
Hmm.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.853
Well, um,
I should get back.

25:20.887 --> 25:21.888
Lou's probably
getting hungry.

25:21.921 --> 25:22.822
Right.

25:22.855 --> 25:26.025
Um, hey, thanks again,
and... [chuckling]

25:26.058 --> 25:27.293
I'll make sure
I get these back to you.

25:27.326 --> 25:28.661
Ah, don't worry.

25:28.695 --> 25:29.596
I know where to find you.

25:31.998 --> 25:33.265
No, seriously,

25:33.299 --> 25:34.567
watching the sun set

25:34.601 --> 25:35.935
behind the snow-capped
mountains,

25:35.968 --> 25:37.236
it's one of those things,

25:37.269 --> 25:39.171
if you're lucky enough
to see it,

25:39.205 --> 25:40.707
you shouldn't miss it.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.210
Have a good
night, Claire.

25:44.243 --> 25:45.712
Good night.

25:50.082 --> 25:51.951
He sure is
a cutie.

25:51.984 --> 25:54.220
And such a good father
to that little girl.

25:54.253 --> 25:57.924
And, um, Chamonix's mom?

25:57.957 --> 25:59.191
I heard she left

25:59.225 --> 26:00.426
when Chamonix was just
four years old.

26:00.459 --> 26:05.097
Why anyone would leave that man
and that sweet little thing

26:05.131 --> 26:06.666
is beyond me.

26:06.699 --> 26:09.135
But I guess we all can't see
what we're blessed with.

26:10.637 --> 26:11.738
Can I help you

26:11.771 --> 26:13.906
with anything else
tonight, Ms. Benson?

26:13.940 --> 26:15.808
Oh, um, is the gym
still open?

26:15.842 --> 26:17.677
I know it's after 4:00, but...

26:17.710 --> 26:19.646
Your room key
should unlock it.

26:19.679 --> 26:20.680
Okay.

26:20.713 --> 26:21.648
Well, good night, Patty.

26:21.681 --> 26:22.749
Good night.

26:28.120 --> 26:32.058
[***]

26:50.042 --> 26:54.313
[***]

26:58.350 --> 26:59.986
[line ringing]

27:01.420 --> 27:02.421
Hey, Mom.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.023
Hey, sweetie-pie.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.391
What are you doing?

27:05.424 --> 27:07.193
Not much.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.261
Was that the oven timer?

27:09.295 --> 27:11.664
[laughs] Yes, it is.

27:11.698 --> 27:13.900
I just pulled out

27:13.933 --> 27:15.301
my last batch
of Christmas cookies.

27:15.334 --> 27:16.903
Are you getting any rest?

27:16.936 --> 27:18.170
Not really.

27:18.204 --> 27:20.907
I'm frustrated
I can't train properly, and...

27:20.940 --> 27:24.711
I don't know,
I'm feeling kind of restless.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.212
Must be all this mountain air.

27:26.245 --> 27:27.814
I thought that mountains

27:27.847 --> 27:28.948
were supposed to have
a calming effect.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.351
Well, I'm not so sure
that's working.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.887
You know what,

27:34.921 --> 27:37.156
I was going to send you
a box of cookies,

27:37.189 --> 27:40.226
but now I'm thinking I might
just deliver them myself.

27:40.259 --> 27:41.260
You shouldn't be alone.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.129
It's almost Christmas.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.331
Mom, I'm fine, honestly.
Don't worry.

27:45.364 --> 27:47.133
No, I miss you.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.935
I'm going to get
these cookies packed up,

27:48.968 --> 27:49.802
and myself packed up,

27:49.836 --> 27:51.270
and get there
as quickly as possible.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.205
Now, you just get some sleep.

27:53.239 --> 27:54.406
And save your appetite.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.842
Okay, Mom.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.243
I love you.

27:57.276 --> 27:59.045
I love you, baby.

28:01.948 --> 28:03.082
[sighs deeply]

28:04.216 --> 28:05.251
I can't believe

28:05.284 --> 28:06.853
Claire Benson
was in our house.

28:06.886 --> 28:09.288
She's one of
my favorite skaters.

28:09.321 --> 28:11.390
Is she really?

28:11.423 --> 28:13.159
I hope she gets better

28:13.192 --> 28:16.095
so she can compete in
Nationals in a few weeks.

28:16.128 --> 28:17.764
Is she a medalist?

28:17.797 --> 28:20.299
Uh-huh, two bronze
and one silver.

28:20.332 --> 28:21.734
She hasn't
won gold yet,

28:21.768 --> 28:23.770
so she has to
get better.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.972
Hopefully
she takes the time

28:26.005 --> 28:28.140
to rest and heal.

28:28.174 --> 28:30.009
Okay, let's
get you to bed.

28:36.115 --> 28:37.116
[sighs]

28:38.417 --> 28:40.887
[***]

29:01.240 --> 29:03.275
[groans in frustration]

29:08.447 --> 29:10.216
Oh, Ms. Benson!

29:10.249 --> 29:12.151
You're not planning
on running today, are you?

29:12.184 --> 29:14.286
Because we got
some fresh powder last night.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.055
It'll be in
over your ankles.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.925
Well, I can't exactly
run in boots.

29:18.958 --> 29:19.859
No, but you can ski.

29:19.892 --> 29:20.893
Hmm.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.038
Hey.

29:32.071 --> 29:33.305
Claire,
are you skiing?

29:33.339 --> 29:34.373
[laughs]
I'm trying to.

29:34.406 --> 29:37.243
Well, I wouldn't suggest
going down such a big hill

29:37.276 --> 29:38.344
in cross countries.

29:38.377 --> 29:39.545
Thank you,

29:39.578 --> 29:41.180
I wasn't actually
planning on it.

29:41.213 --> 29:42.849
But you can toboggan down it.

29:42.882 --> 29:43.950
[chuckles]

29:43.983 --> 29:45.885
I really wasn't
planning on tobogganing.

29:45.918 --> 29:46.853
But you have to.

29:46.886 --> 29:48.054
It's the best toboggan hill
on the mountain.

29:48.087 --> 29:49.455
Oh.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.157
I don't know...

29:51.190 --> 29:54.126
Come on, you can
come up front with me.

29:55.194 --> 29:56.528
Okay.

29:57.596 --> 29:58.865
Hey, wait up.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.836
[***]

30:03.870 --> 30:06.038
[squealing]

30:07.506 --> 30:08.607
Whoa!

30:08.640 --> 30:10.376
[cheering and laughing]

30:12.011 --> 30:13.479
Go!

30:13.512 --> 30:14.613
We got her this time!

30:14.646 --> 30:16.215
Yeah!

30:16.248 --> 30:17.984
Whoo!

30:18.017 --> 30:19.351
She still won!

30:19.385 --> 30:20.486
What?

30:20.519 --> 30:22.288
[laughing]

30:22.321 --> 30:24.056
Wasn't that awesome?

30:24.090 --> 30:25.391
You're right,

30:25.424 --> 30:27.193
that's the best
toboggan hill ever.

30:27.226 --> 30:28.527
Come on!

30:31.931 --> 30:33.199
Come on, now!

30:33.232 --> 30:34.300
Whoo!

30:37.503 --> 30:39.005
[laughing]

30:39.038 --> 30:40.339
This is so much fun.

30:42.108 --> 30:43.175
Oh, ho, ho...

30:52.584 --> 30:53.485
Oh, is this
two against one?

30:59.959 --> 31:01.393
I love you, little monkey!

31:01.427 --> 31:04.964
[***]

31:15.507 --> 31:17.476
That wasn't exactly
the workout I had planned

31:17.509 --> 31:18.644
[chuckling]

31:18.677 --> 31:22.148
Yeah, but I bet
it was more fun.

31:24.316 --> 31:25.684
Julian.

31:25.717 --> 31:28.387
What are you
doing here?

31:28.420 --> 31:30.156
Look at you!

31:31.357 --> 31:33.359
I'm making sure

31:33.392 --> 31:35.561
my girl is being
properly cared for.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.296
[chuckles] Luke,
this is Julian,

31:37.329 --> 31:39.231
my coach.

31:39.265 --> 31:40.232
Ah. Nice to meet you, Julian.

31:40.266 --> 31:41.433
Likewise.

31:41.467 --> 31:43.702
Luke was just helping me out
with the whole skiing thing.

31:43.735 --> 31:44.703
It's a great way to train

31:44.736 --> 31:46.272
in the snow,
right?

31:46.305 --> 31:47.974
It's actually
a really good workout.

31:48.007 --> 31:48.975
Mm-hmm.

31:52.678 --> 31:53.679
Well, we should
get going.

31:53.712 --> 31:54.646
Sweetheart.

31:58.117 --> 31:59.451
Thanks for everything again.

31:59.485 --> 32:01.087
Yeah, of course.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.121
Pleasure, Julian.

32:02.154 --> 32:03.389
Luke.

32:05.457 --> 32:06.525
Bye, Claire.
Thanks for the tobogganing.

32:06.558 --> 32:09.028
You bet.

32:12.398 --> 32:13.465
Anyway, we'd better get going.

32:13.499 --> 32:15.334
I've got a physio appointment
in 10.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.373
I'm sorry!

32:21.407 --> 32:23.242
I've only got
really large bills!

32:25.577 --> 32:27.079
That hurt?

32:27.113 --> 32:29.348
No, it's fine.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.050
See?

32:31.083 --> 32:32.251
She'll be as good as new
in no time.

32:33.419 --> 32:34.453
And then
you can say

32:34.486 --> 32:36.188
you run an accelerated program.

32:38.657 --> 32:40.659
Hmm?

32:42.261 --> 32:43.695
[scoffs]

32:49.101 --> 32:51.470
All right, Conner,
get it on that rebound!

32:51.503 --> 32:52.404
I can't believe

32:52.438 --> 32:54.373
the clinic didn't invest
in an indoor rink.

32:54.406 --> 32:56.508
I mean, look at this.

32:56.542 --> 32:58.344
It's like a pond.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.146
[chuckles]

33:00.179 --> 33:03.049
And there's snow
all over the ice.

33:03.082 --> 33:04.550
That's it, David,
nice pass, buddy!

33:04.583 --> 33:07.153
Nice approach.
Loving the offence, boys!

33:07.186 --> 33:09.988
Maybe we should come back
in a little bit.

33:11.423 --> 33:12.591
Excuse me!

33:12.624 --> 33:14.393
Hey! Excuse me!
Excuse me!

33:14.426 --> 33:15.727
-Luke, right?
-Yeah.

33:15.761 --> 33:17.663
Whoa, easy.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.731
I got it.

33:19.765 --> 33:21.167
About how much longer
before the ice is cleared?

33:21.200 --> 33:22.501
Practice will be over
in 10 minutes.

33:22.534 --> 33:23.435
Then you're going to
bring out the zamboni

33:23.469 --> 33:24.670
and clear the ice?

33:24.703 --> 33:27.506
We don't have a zamboni,
we just have shovels.

33:30.409 --> 33:32.744
Wow, Ryan, nice shot!
Lovin' it, buddy!

33:32.778 --> 33:34.413
Claire, I'll be
right back!

33:36.782 --> 33:38.517
Atta boy!

33:38.550 --> 33:39.818
All right, Sean,
let's line it up!

33:39.851 --> 33:42.188
[chuckling]

33:42.221 --> 33:43.689
He sure loves
coaching those kids.

33:45.124 --> 33:47.193
And they're lucky
to have him.

33:47.226 --> 33:48.060
It's not often
a kid in Minor hockey

33:48.094 --> 33:51.097
gets a former pro
that coaches them.

33:51.130 --> 33:53.699
How long ago
did Luke play?

33:53.732 --> 33:56.302
Well, he's been up here
for three years,

33:56.335 --> 33:58.504
so four years ago?

33:58.537 --> 34:01.273
But he was the best
when he played.

34:01.307 --> 34:03.309
I'd imagine every one
of those kids

34:03.342 --> 34:05.377
has his poster
on their wall.

34:05.411 --> 34:07.213
Really?

34:07.246 --> 34:09.748
Huh.
I had no idea.

34:09.781 --> 34:12.551
Yeah, he was MVP
three times.

34:13.819 --> 34:15.786
Of course, I understand

34:15.821 --> 34:18.389
if you're not up
on your hockey stats.

34:21.327 --> 34:22.661
Hey, atta girl,
Chamonix!

34:22.694 --> 34:23.661
Nice!

34:25.831 --> 34:27.632
Hi, Claire.

34:27.666 --> 34:29.335
Did you come to practice, too?

34:29.368 --> 34:31.270
Yeah, sure did.

34:31.303 --> 34:32.638
Hey, Uncle Lou, did you know

34:32.670 --> 34:35.274
Claire won silver at the last
National Championships.

34:35.306 --> 34:36.675
What?

34:36.708 --> 34:39.178
I had no idea.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.279
It's okay.

34:40.312 --> 34:41.280
I understand if
you're not up to date

34:41.313 --> 34:43.382
on your figure
skating stats.

34:43.415 --> 34:44.616
[chuckling]

34:44.650 --> 34:47.152
Got me.

34:47.186 --> 34:48.286
Have fun!

34:50.222 --> 34:52.224
I can't find anybody
to clear this ice.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.625
Uh, well,
that would be me.

34:54.826 --> 34:58.597
But I won't get to it
for about an hour.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.199
Come on, you don't
expect people

35:00.232 --> 35:01.433
to be able to skate
on this, do you?

35:01.467 --> 35:04.136
Lou, maybe you could
make an exception

35:04.170 --> 35:05.304
and clear it off
a bit earlier today?

35:05.337 --> 35:07.839
For Claire?

35:07.873 --> 35:10.909
Right, yeah,
for, um...

35:10.942 --> 35:13.379
for Claire.

35:13.412 --> 35:14.480
Thanks, Lou.

35:14.513 --> 35:15.614
My pleasure.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.684
No problem.

35:20.819 --> 35:23.189
All right.

35:23.222 --> 35:25.391
Okay, boys, keep it going!

35:26.525 --> 35:27.526
Thanks, buddy.

35:42.541 --> 35:43.509
Hey.

35:43.542 --> 35:44.610
Hey.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.812
-You all right?
-Yeah, of course.

35:46.845 --> 35:48.214
Let me guess.

35:48.247 --> 35:50.249
Achilles?

35:50.282 --> 35:51.950
Yeah.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.886
Yeah, I've torn mine
more times than I can count.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.522
May I?

35:56.555 --> 35:58.490
Sure.

35:59.958 --> 36:01.260
So...

36:01.293 --> 36:04.296
how many times
have you injured it?

36:04.330 --> 36:05.864
More times
than I can count.

36:05.897 --> 36:07.366
[chuckles]

36:07.399 --> 36:08.334
You find it's
healing up as well?

36:09.668 --> 36:12.204
It's slower than usual,

36:12.238 --> 36:14.540
which is frustrating,
'cause I need it to heal faster.

36:14.573 --> 36:15.841
Yeah.

36:15.874 --> 36:17.276
It's tough,

36:17.309 --> 36:18.777
being an athlete

36:18.810 --> 36:20.479
but knowing your body's
not keeping up anymore.

36:21.880 --> 36:22.814
I guess
that's something

36:22.848 --> 36:24.850
we all face.

36:24.883 --> 36:26.952
Just try not to be scared of it,

36:26.985 --> 36:30.456
'cause the other side
is not so bad.

36:37.028 --> 36:37.829
Is there a problem, Claire?

36:39.531 --> 36:41.967
No, I was just
putting my binding on.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.969
Oh, let me help.

36:44.002 --> 36:46.605
Maybe she should take a break
and not overdo it.

36:46.638 --> 36:47.973
[chuckles] Thank you,

36:48.006 --> 36:49.408
but after coaching
for 10 years,

36:49.441 --> 36:51.277
I'm pretty sure
I know what Claire needs.

36:52.544 --> 36:53.679
Let's have a look.

36:53.712 --> 36:54.913
It's okay,
I've got it.

36:59.618 --> 37:00.852
Do you think I could learn
to skate like Claire?

37:00.886 --> 37:02.621
Sure, why not?

37:02.654 --> 37:03.955
Come on,
let's go home.

37:12.798 --> 37:14.333
[sighs heavily]

37:17.068 --> 37:18.937
You have to work through
the injury, Claire.

37:18.970 --> 37:19.938
Don't let it
hold you back.

37:19.971 --> 37:21.473
Remember, you're strong.

37:21.507 --> 37:22.808
Yeah, but the thing is,
I don't feel strong.

37:22.841 --> 37:23.842
Mind over matter.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.043
Claire!

37:25.076 --> 37:26.778
Mom!

37:26.812 --> 37:27.746
[laughing happily]

37:27.779 --> 37:29.748
Oh, baby.

37:29.781 --> 37:31.483
Julian!

37:31.517 --> 37:33.585
I didn't expect to see you here.

37:33.619 --> 37:34.886
Lovely to
see you, Dale.

37:36.555 --> 37:37.623
Julian surprised me.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.658
Couldn't let my girl
work through this on her own.

37:39.691 --> 37:42.328
Mm, God forbid you
leave her alone for too long.

37:42.361 --> 37:43.362
She might actually get a life.

37:43.395 --> 37:44.530
[laughs]

37:44.563 --> 37:46.332
Mom, uh, did you
get your room?

37:46.365 --> 37:47.599
I arranged one
for you.

37:47.633 --> 37:49.468
Oh, I didn't know
I could stay here.

37:49.501 --> 37:50.936
Oh, it's always quiet
just before the holidays,

37:50.969 --> 37:52.704
so we have
plenty of rooms.

37:52.738 --> 37:53.972
Oh, and you shouldn't miss

37:54.005 --> 37:55.507
the annual
Christmas tree decorating

37:55.541 --> 37:56.575
tonight.

37:56.608 --> 37:57.743
Oh, that
sounds lovely.

37:57.776 --> 37:58.844
Where is that
happening?

37:58.877 --> 37:59.845
In the town square.

37:59.878 --> 38:00.812
Everyone goes.

38:00.846 --> 38:02.414
Really?

38:02.448 --> 38:03.782
Everyone in town?

38:03.815 --> 38:05.617
Oh, yes.

38:05.651 --> 38:07.052
There's hot chocolate,
a bonfire, caroling,

38:07.085 --> 38:09.588
oh, and of course
the Christmas tree decorating.

38:09.621 --> 38:12.358
Ooh, it sounds,
perfectly Smallville,

38:12.391 --> 38:13.291
but we're going to
have to pass.

38:13.325 --> 38:14.960
Well, speak for yourself.
I'd love to go.

38:14.993 --> 38:15.961
Claire?

38:15.994 --> 38:17.529
Um...

38:17.563 --> 38:20.566
Well, maybe we could go
for just a bit?

38:20.599 --> 38:22.000
Fine, but I'm going, too,

38:22.033 --> 38:25.371
and we will return no later
than 10:00 sharp, okay?

38:25.404 --> 38:26.638
Ta-ta!

38:27.706 --> 38:28.640
Well,

38:28.674 --> 38:31.677
it's been over 30 years
since I've a curfew.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.445
I hope we don't get grounded.

38:33.479 --> 38:35.647
[laughing]

38:35.681 --> 38:37.549
[roar and bustle
of busy crowd]

38:37.583 --> 38:38.984
[***]

38:40.118 --> 38:41.653
[Dale]: Oh, my.

38:41.687 --> 38:44.423
This brings me back
to when I was a little girl.

38:44.456 --> 38:45.691
Our town had a tree
that everyone decorated

38:45.724 --> 38:47.393
as well.

38:47.426 --> 38:48.494
What about you,
Julian?

38:48.527 --> 38:49.795
My town had
nothing for me.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.530
I left when I was 10
to live with my aunt,

38:51.563 --> 38:53.565
so I could pursue
my skating career.

38:53.599 --> 38:55.000
Well, that must have
been hard for you,

38:55.033 --> 38:56.134
being without
your family.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.636
Well, like
my father said,

38:57.669 --> 38:59.371
"Second is only
the first loser,"

38:59.405 --> 39:00.672
and I didn't want
to lose.

39:00.706 --> 39:01.673
[cell phone ringing]
One sec.

39:01.707 --> 39:02.874
Hello?

39:02.908 --> 39:04.676
Anna!

39:04.710 --> 39:06.077
Anna, I can
barely hear you.

39:06.111 --> 39:08.680
Just hang on
one second, all right?

39:08.714 --> 39:09.715
She's trying to get me
to coach her,

39:09.748 --> 39:10.716
but don't worry.

39:10.749 --> 39:12.150
You're my girl.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.485
Anna?

39:16.655 --> 39:18.390
Claire!

39:18.424 --> 39:19.991
Did you come
to decorate?

39:20.025 --> 39:22.394
We did, but we don't have
any decorations.

39:22.428 --> 39:24.730
Oh, we, um...

39:24.763 --> 39:26.498
we have plenty.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.500
Hi, Lou.
This is my mom.

39:28.534 --> 39:30.769
Hi.
It's a pleasure, Mrs...

39:30.802 --> 39:31.870
Benson.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.739
But widowed.

39:33.772 --> 39:34.940
You can call me Dale.

39:34.973 --> 39:36.442
[chuckles awkwardly]

39:36.475 --> 39:37.776
And you are?

39:37.809 --> 39:38.744
Chamonix.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.079
Is your dad here?

39:41.112 --> 39:44.082
Oh, you bet I am.

39:45.884 --> 39:48.019
Daddy, this is
Claire's mom, Dale.

39:48.053 --> 39:49.555
Oh, nice to
meet you, Dale.

39:49.588 --> 39:50.856
Glad you could
join us.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.524
Well, I couldn't leave
my little girl alone

39:52.558 --> 39:53.525
at the holidays.

39:53.559 --> 39:54.860
So, um,

39:54.893 --> 39:56.795
how did you all meet?

39:56.828 --> 39:59.765
Oh, well, Prince Charming here

39:59.798 --> 40:02.468
saved your daughter
from falling through the ice.

40:02.501 --> 40:05.471
Well, then,
I guess you would be

40:05.504 --> 40:07.539
her knight
in shining armor.

40:07.573 --> 40:11.176
Uh... Mom, why don't we
get you some apple cider?

40:11.209 --> 40:13.579
I happen to know
exactly where it is.

40:13.612 --> 40:14.846
It would be my pleasure.

40:15.981 --> 40:17.549
Well...

40:17.583 --> 40:19.551
How can I refuse?

40:19.585 --> 40:21.186
Right this way.

40:21.219 --> 40:24.956
Daddy, why is uncle Lou
acting goofy?

40:24.990 --> 40:27.659
Um, here, I've got
that new ornament.

40:27.693 --> 40:29.160
Look.

40:29.194 --> 40:31.497
Wow, did you make that?

40:31.530 --> 40:32.498
Uh-huh.

40:32.531 --> 40:34.866
You hang it on a Christmas tree
and make a wish.

40:34.900 --> 40:36.635
I wish
Claire gets better

40:36.668 --> 40:38.537
so she can become
a World Champion.

40:38.570 --> 40:39.538
Thank you, Chamonix.

40:42.140 --> 40:43.775
So...

40:43.809 --> 40:45.477
I bet you're a pretty
good hockey player,

40:45.511 --> 40:46.244
with your dad as your coach.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.213
I'm okay,

40:48.246 --> 40:50.115
but I really want to learn how
to be a figure skater.

40:50.148 --> 40:52.083
Really?

40:52.117 --> 40:53.985
Uh-huh, I watch
all the competitions.

40:54.019 --> 40:56.822
Hey, maybe you can
teach me some moves?

40:56.855 --> 40:58.557
Oh, I'm sure
Claire's too busy for that.

40:58.590 --> 41:00.926
Are you kidding?
I'd be happy to.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.060
How about tomorrow?

41:02.093 --> 41:03.962
We could get Dicksons' boy in
to cover at the shop.

41:03.995 --> 41:05.631
Thanks, Daddy.
Thanks, Claire.

41:05.664 --> 41:07.065
Excuse me!

41:07.098 --> 41:09.034
Could I have everyone's
attention, please?

41:09.067 --> 41:10.836
It's that time
of the night

41:10.869 --> 41:12.604
when I call upon
all the brawn of our men

41:12.638 --> 41:15.507
and women

41:15.541 --> 41:18.877
to help prepare for our annual
Christmas Eve bonfire.

41:18.910 --> 41:21.046
So, grab an axe,

41:21.079 --> 41:23.281
and let's see what you got.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.850
Julian,

41:24.883 --> 41:26.084
I know you said
you won't be here,

41:26.117 --> 41:29.054
but we could really
use your help.

41:29.087 --> 41:32.891
I mean, unless
you can't wield an axe.

41:32.924 --> 41:34.926
I can wield an axe.

41:34.960 --> 41:35.927
Hmm.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.097
After you.

41:39.130 --> 41:41.099
[chuckles]
All right.

41:42.668 --> 41:45.937
Come on, Claire,
let's go.

41:50.576 --> 41:52.944
[crowd applauds]

41:54.179 --> 41:56.815
Well, the man sure
has a lot of brawn.

41:56.848 --> 41:58.183
What about yours?

41:58.216 --> 41:59.851
I really don't think
Julian should do this.

42:01.319 --> 42:03.955
I was talking
about Luke.

42:03.989 --> 42:07.125
Oh, well,
he's not my man.

42:08.193 --> 42:09.628
[applause]

42:11.797 --> 42:13.932
And Julian is?

42:13.965 --> 42:15.033
No, of course not.

42:17.335 --> 42:20.572
Well, he sure is acting
like a jealous boyfriend.

42:20.606 --> 42:22.908
And you're allowed to have
a man in your life, Claire,

42:22.941 --> 42:23.842
other than your coach.

42:30.015 --> 42:31.983
[crowd gasping]

42:33.251 --> 42:34.753
The grumpy man is stuck.

42:36.221 --> 42:37.623
[crowd wincing]

42:39.024 --> 42:39.858
You need a hand?

42:39.891 --> 42:41.927
No, no, no, no,
I got this, thank you.

42:46.031 --> 42:49.234
[groaning in pain]

42:49.267 --> 42:50.602
Julian, are you okay?

42:54.305 --> 42:55.306
Yeah, yeah.

42:55.340 --> 42:56.241
Yeah, of course,
I'm okay.

42:58.176 --> 42:59.678
Okay, it's time to go.

42:59.711 --> 43:00.746
But you can't,

43:00.779 --> 43:02.648
you'll miss the tree lighting
and the caroling.

43:02.681 --> 43:03.649
Some people have
more important things

43:03.682 --> 43:05.050
to prepare for,
little girl.

43:05.083 --> 43:06.652
Besides, isn't it
past your bedtime?

43:06.685 --> 43:07.786
Hey.

43:07.819 --> 43:08.754
You don't get to boss
everyone around,

43:08.787 --> 43:09.688
especially not
my daughter.

43:11.222 --> 43:12.624
Claire.

43:13.825 --> 43:15.661
I'm sorry, Chamonix,
I have to go,

43:15.694 --> 43:17.696
but, um, I'll meet you
tomorrow morning

43:17.729 --> 43:18.730
at the rink, okay?

43:19.798 --> 43:20.732
Good night.

43:28.974 --> 43:29.875
[tsks in disappointment]

43:32.143 --> 43:34.112
You okay? Good.

43:34.145 --> 43:36.882
You don't have
to worry about him.

43:38.183 --> 43:41.219
[humming "Silent Night"]

43:47.225 --> 43:52.230
* All is calm...

43:52.263 --> 43:57.836
* All is bright

43:57.869 --> 44:01.973
[singing together]
* Round yon virgin

44:02.007 --> 44:06.144
* Mother and child

44:06.177 --> 44:15.053
* Holy infant
so tender and mild *

44:15.086 --> 44:24.462
* Sleep in heavenly peace

44:24.495 --> 44:32.203
* Sleep in heavenly peace...

44:32.237 --> 44:34.840
[sighs deeply]

44:34.873 --> 44:38.009
Last time I heard you sing,
you were a little girl.

44:39.745 --> 44:41.012
How's Julian?

44:41.046 --> 44:42.047
Ah...

44:42.080 --> 44:43.314
He's lying down.

44:43.348 --> 44:45.717
He'll be fine.

44:45.751 --> 44:48.353
As long as his ego heals.

44:50.021 --> 44:51.156
How about you, baby?

44:52.490 --> 44:55.193
I've always
been able to heal so quickly,

44:55.226 --> 44:56.895
from a fall

44:56.928 --> 44:57.929
or a strain.

44:57.963 --> 44:59.497
I mean, you know.

44:59.530 --> 45:01.800
But this time, it's like,

45:01.833 --> 45:06.237
no matter how hard I try,
no matter how hard I push,

45:06.271 --> 45:08.073
I just...

45:08.106 --> 45:11.176
I can't get there.

45:11.209 --> 45:14.012
What would happen
if you didn't compete?

45:14.045 --> 45:16.347
Baby, I'm not
trying to upset you,

45:16.381 --> 45:18.149
I promise,
it's just...

45:18.183 --> 45:19.751
Well, at some point,

45:19.785 --> 45:21.319
you're going to
have to walk away.

45:21.352 --> 45:24.389
Why not before
you hurt yourself badly?

45:24.422 --> 45:26.124
I know, but...

45:26.157 --> 45:27.258
I just...

45:27.292 --> 45:29.928
What?

45:29.961 --> 45:31.296
I don't know
what I would do

45:31.329 --> 45:32.798
if I couldn't skate.

45:38.136 --> 45:39.504
Do you remember
what you wanted to be

45:39.537 --> 45:42.273
when you were
four years old?

45:42.307 --> 45:43.241
A veterinarian.

45:43.274 --> 45:45.210
[laughs]

45:45.243 --> 45:47.178
And a fashion
designer.

45:47.212 --> 45:49.080
Well, and
a firefighter,

45:49.114 --> 45:51.249
and a mom.

45:51.282 --> 45:55.186
Sweetie, there's still
plenty for you to do.

45:55.220 --> 45:58.089
You have so much ahead of you.

45:58.123 --> 46:00.826
No matter what Julian says.

46:14.605 --> 46:16.541
[knock on door]

46:19.477 --> 46:20.445
Hey...

46:20.478 --> 46:21.479
Hey.

46:21.512 --> 46:22.480
How are you feeling?

46:22.513 --> 46:23.448
Ah, good as new.

46:23.481 --> 46:24.449
[groans]

46:24.482 --> 46:25.450
Julian...

46:26.952 --> 46:28.053
I hear we have
a new patient.

46:28.086 --> 46:29.120
I'm good,
I'm good.

46:29.154 --> 46:31.356
Not so fast, not so fast.

46:31.389 --> 46:32.557
I gotta train.

46:32.590 --> 46:33.825
I'm in the middle
of training.

46:33.859 --> 46:35.593
Well, right now,
you need to relax

46:35.626 --> 46:37.262
and let me
take care of you.

46:37.295 --> 46:39.330
Okay, Julian, I'm going to
head to the rink without you,

46:39.364 --> 46:40.365
but feel better, okay?

46:40.398 --> 46:42.467
No, no, no, no...

46:42.500 --> 46:43.902
It's okay,
I got this.

46:43.935 --> 46:44.903
[Julian yelps] Wow!

46:44.936 --> 46:46.204
Come on,
this leg up.

46:46.237 --> 46:48.539
What?
This leg up?

46:48.573 --> 46:50.075
This leg.
This leg up.

46:50.108 --> 46:51.176
Ow...

46:51.209 --> 46:52.143
Easy, easy, easy.

46:52.177 --> 46:53.178
Arm over.

46:53.211 --> 46:54.212
I'm frightened.

46:54.245 --> 46:55.280
You're gonna be
just fine.

46:55.313 --> 46:57.148
You're in great hands.

46:57.182 --> 46:58.216
You can sit up
a little bit.

46:58.249 --> 46:59.317
Over the shoulder.

46:59.350 --> 47:01.086
Over the shoulder?
Over the shoulder!

47:01.119 --> 47:02.587
I'm gonna grab
your butt now.

47:02.620 --> 47:04.322
Okay, there we go...

47:05.924 --> 47:07.325
Are you sure
you want these skates

47:07.358 --> 47:08.593
over your hockey skates?

47:08.626 --> 47:09.861
Yes, I'm sure.

47:09.895 --> 47:11.196
I don't know.

47:11.229 --> 47:12.497
Yes.
There she is.

47:12.530 --> 47:13.464
[laughing]
Hi.

47:13.498 --> 47:14.499
Oh, hey.

47:14.532 --> 47:15.967
Claire, look!

47:16.001 --> 47:17.302
Those are nice.

47:17.335 --> 47:18.636
I love
the pink laces.

47:18.669 --> 47:20.071
I got them
from Santa last year,

47:20.105 --> 47:21.907
but I never really used them.

47:21.940 --> 47:23.008
Daddy prefers hockey

47:23.041 --> 47:24.009
over figure skating.

47:24.042 --> 47:25.343
Oh, really?

47:25.376 --> 47:26.511
Well, maybe we should get
your dad

47:26.544 --> 47:27.612
some pink laces to match.

47:27.645 --> 47:30.081
[laughs] Okay.

47:30.115 --> 47:31.482
Okay, you two,
it's time to hit the ice.

47:35.253 --> 47:37.155
[***]

47:38.924 --> 47:40.625
[laughing]

47:43.428 --> 47:45.230
That's so good.

47:45.263 --> 47:47.198
One more.

47:47.232 --> 47:49.267
Nice!

47:49.300 --> 47:51.036
[***]

47:51.069 --> 47:52.037
Very good, very good.

47:53.671 --> 47:54.872
Okay, here we go.

47:56.674 --> 47:58.643
Try one leg.

47:58.676 --> 48:00.311
Good!

48:01.479 --> 48:03.114
Very good!

48:03.148 --> 48:06.017
Good job!

48:06.051 --> 48:07.585
You did it!
Amazing!

48:07.618 --> 48:08.920
Did you
see that, Daddy?

48:08.954 --> 48:11.456
I sure did.
You're a natural.

48:11.489 --> 48:14.325
[laughing] You're dad's right,
you are a natural,

48:14.359 --> 48:16.527
but I think we should
call it a day.

48:16.561 --> 48:17.595
Aw...

48:17.628 --> 48:18.696
I know,
but trust me,

48:18.729 --> 48:21.532
nothing good comes from
pushing too hard, all right?

48:21.566 --> 48:23.301
And I promise
we'll come back again.

48:23.334 --> 48:24.970
Let's go.

48:26.304 --> 48:27.305
Daddy, Claire says

48:27.338 --> 48:28.439
we can do it
again sometime.

48:28.473 --> 48:29.640
So when?

48:29.674 --> 48:31.676
Uh... I'm sure
we'll figure that out.

48:31.709 --> 48:34.145
Now, why don't you
get your boots back on

48:34.179 --> 48:35.213
so you're not late for
your sleepover at Maya's, okay?

48:35.246 --> 48:36.581
Thanks, Claire.

48:36.614 --> 48:39.717
Oh, you are very welcome.

48:39.750 --> 48:40.986
You're an excellent pupil.

48:41.019 --> 48:42.920
Well, you're a great coach.

48:46.757 --> 48:49.060
Thank you.

48:49.094 --> 48:51.096
I'm sure you
probably took time

48:51.129 --> 48:52.263
out of your own training
to do this.

48:52.297 --> 48:54.732
Well, Julian's
out of commission, so...

48:54.765 --> 48:56.201
Oh, right,
how is Julian?

48:56.234 --> 48:57.402
Um, he'll be fine.

48:57.435 --> 48:59.137
So, is he
just your...

48:59.170 --> 49:00.238
Coach.

49:00.271 --> 49:01.339
Yeah, he's just my coach.

49:01.372 --> 49:03.008
Right.

49:03.041 --> 49:05.410
Yeah, I was just asking
because it seems--

49:05.443 --> 49:07.212
He's very protective of me.

49:07.245 --> 49:08.713
Of course.

49:08.746 --> 49:11.649
Well, look, if, um, you don't
plan on training today,

49:11.682 --> 49:13.718
I'm going to be hitting the ice
and doing some fishing,

49:13.751 --> 49:15.420
if you want to come?

49:15.453 --> 49:17.989
Didn't you warn me
to stay off the ice?

49:18.023 --> 49:20.391
Oh, don't worry,
it's solid now.

49:20.425 --> 49:23.261
You could just drop by the shop
in about an hour,

49:23.294 --> 49:25.330
and I could set you up
with a rod.

49:25.363 --> 49:27.298
Well, why not?

49:27.332 --> 49:28.766
My ankle could use the rest,

49:28.799 --> 49:31.602
and I'm sure Julian's
in good hands.

49:31.636 --> 49:33.004
[sighing
and cracking knuckles]

49:34.205 --> 49:37.208
[screaming and spluttering]

49:37.242 --> 49:39.244
[joints cracking]

49:39.277 --> 49:41.546
Hi.

49:41.579 --> 49:42.613
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

49:42.647 --> 49:44.349
Oh, Julian,
you're up.

49:44.382 --> 49:47.118
I am, and feeling like
an Olympian again.

49:47.152 --> 49:49.520
That woman is very strong.

49:49.554 --> 49:51.189
How was training?

49:51.222 --> 49:53.591
Oh, um... it was good.

49:53.624 --> 49:55.460
It was really great.

49:55.493 --> 49:56.527
Excellent.

49:56.561 --> 49:57.528
Well, let's have
a light snack,

49:57.562 --> 49:58.463
and then
get back at 'er.

49:58.496 --> 49:59.697
Oh, um...

49:59.730 --> 50:02.400
you know, I think I might have
overdone it just a wee bit,

50:02.433 --> 50:04.302
so I thought taking
the rest of the day off

50:04.335 --> 50:05.370
would be best.

50:05.403 --> 50:07.205
Just so I don't
set myself back.

50:07.238 --> 50:10.175
Okay, just a gym session then.

50:10.208 --> 50:11.176
Actually, I was thinking

50:11.209 --> 50:14.412
about experiencing
some of the local culture.

50:14.445 --> 50:15.613
Like ice fishing.

50:15.646 --> 50:17.548
Really?

50:17.582 --> 50:19.384
And who would you be
experiencing this with?

50:19.417 --> 50:20.651
Luke.

50:20.685 --> 50:21.752
Uh, but

50:21.786 --> 50:23.488
just because he knows
what he's doing.

50:23.521 --> 50:24.455
Mm-hmm.

50:25.690 --> 50:27.425
Local culture, huh?

50:27.458 --> 50:29.026
That actually sounds like
a really good idea.

50:30.228 --> 50:31.196
It-- it does?

50:31.229 --> 50:32.230
Yeah, it does.

50:32.263 --> 50:33.531
Excuse me, sunshine.

50:33.564 --> 50:37.135
Get us a shuttle,
would you?

50:37.168 --> 50:38.436
[whispering]
I don't know her name.

50:40.471 --> 50:42.039
[sighs heavily]

50:50.848 --> 50:52.183
Okay...

50:54.852 --> 50:57.122
Look who's going
to join us fishing.

50:57.155 --> 50:58.823
Oh. Well,
I'm glad to see

50:58.856 --> 51:00.158
we didn't put you
out of commission.

51:02.793 --> 51:05.096
I'll just, uh,
I'll get the snowmobiles ready.

51:05.130 --> 51:06.164
You do know
how to drive one?

51:06.197 --> 51:08.566
[scoffs] Yeah.

51:08.599 --> 51:09.767
Great.

51:09.800 --> 51:11.369
We'll clearly need to
get you suited up

51:11.402 --> 51:12.570
in something different.

51:12.603 --> 51:14.139
I've got a few things
for you, too,

51:14.172 --> 51:15.373
and I'll grab you
a helmet.

51:15.406 --> 51:16.341
I'll be right back.

51:18.876 --> 51:20.245
Something different?

51:36.627 --> 51:37.862
Hi.

51:37.895 --> 51:39.164
Hello!

51:39.197 --> 51:41.132
Luke, my boy.
Just in time.

51:41.166 --> 51:42.467
The fish are just
starting to bite.

51:42.500 --> 51:43.568
Maybe for you,

51:43.601 --> 51:45.836
but I haven't had
a nibble all day.

51:45.870 --> 51:48.906
Oh, stop your
bellyaching, old man.

51:48.939 --> 51:50.408
You're just worried
'cause the wife told ya

51:50.441 --> 51:51.276
if you don't come home
with fish,

51:51.309 --> 51:52.643
don't come home
with anything at all.

51:52.677 --> 51:53.911
[chuckling]

51:53.944 --> 51:55.846
Looks like you got
the girlfriend with you.

51:55.880 --> 51:57.782
[together]:
Oh, no, we're not...

51:57.815 --> 51:59.317
All right,
okay, here I am!

51:59.350 --> 52:01.886
The snowmobile stalled.

52:07.392 --> 52:08.793
Let's do some fishing!

52:08.826 --> 52:09.694
Oh, here,

52:09.727 --> 52:11.262
let me get some bait
on there for you.

52:15.866 --> 52:16.767
You know what,
I got it.

52:16.801 --> 52:17.768
I can do it.

52:17.802 --> 52:19.937
Okay.

52:19.970 --> 52:20.938
Julian?

52:20.971 --> 52:22.507
Ew!

52:22.540 --> 52:23.441
Uh, actually--

52:23.474 --> 52:25.610
No, I'll just stick
with the lure there.

52:29.214 --> 52:31.349
Now, now, boys, when I first got
up to this mountain,

52:31.382 --> 52:32.417
I didn't know much
about ice fishing either.

52:32.450 --> 52:33.751
He's got that right.

52:33.784 --> 52:35.753
But we let it slide,

52:35.786 --> 52:37.388
what with him being
so great on the ice

52:37.422 --> 52:38.389
in other ways.

52:38.423 --> 52:39.824
Really?

52:39.857 --> 52:40.891
How so?

52:40.925 --> 52:42.760
Young man,

52:42.793 --> 52:44.362
you are sitting
with ice royalty.

52:44.395 --> 52:45.530
Okay,
come on, guys.

52:45.563 --> 52:47.332
Luke was one of
the best hockey players

52:47.365 --> 52:48.899
in his day.

52:48.933 --> 52:50.401
If it wasn't for
that dang injury,

52:50.435 --> 52:51.869
he'd still be one of the best.

52:51.902 --> 52:53.471
So you quit?

52:53.504 --> 52:54.605
No, I didn't quit.

52:54.639 --> 52:55.640
I chose not
to put my body

52:55.673 --> 52:56.741
through
any more abuse.

52:56.774 --> 52:58.543
Ah, well,

52:58.576 --> 52:59.744
sometimes
us athletes,

52:59.777 --> 53:02.513
we need to push ourselves
in order to achieve greatness.

53:02.547 --> 53:03.914
I myself won
four gold medals,

53:03.948 --> 53:05.816
even while
my body was tired,

53:05.850 --> 53:08.319
because unlike you,
I never gave up.

53:09.720 --> 53:10.988
[reel spinning]

53:11.021 --> 53:12.490
I think I have a bite!

53:12.523 --> 53:13.391
You've definitely
got one there.

53:13.424 --> 53:14.492
All right,

53:14.525 --> 53:15.526
just jig the line
a little a bit.

53:15.560 --> 53:16.794
Okay.

53:16.827 --> 53:18.529
There you go.
Okay, and now a quick tug.

53:18.563 --> 53:19.830
Atta girl,
reel 'er in!

53:19.864 --> 53:21.499
[laughing]

53:21.532 --> 53:22.967
That's a nice one.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.569
Is it?

53:24.602 --> 53:25.603
George here wishes

53:25.636 --> 53:26.671
he could get one
half that big.

53:26.704 --> 53:27.838
Well, you know what, George,

53:27.872 --> 53:28.839
you can bring this one
home to your wife.

53:28.873 --> 53:30.708
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

53:30.741 --> 53:31.809
I've got one, too.
I've got one, too.

53:31.842 --> 53:32.843
Okay, let your line out--

53:32.877 --> 53:34.645
I've got this,
I've got this.

53:34.679 --> 53:35.813
Okay... all right.

53:35.846 --> 53:37.448
Oh, it's a big one,
I can feel it.

53:37.482 --> 53:39.417
Take it easy now.
You're tugging too hard!

53:39.450 --> 53:41.719
Oh, yeah, here it comes,
here it comes!

53:43.521 --> 53:46.557
[screaming]

53:46.591 --> 53:47.692
[scream reverberating]

53:50.361 --> 53:52.663
Fellas, how's the, uh,
how's the fishing going?

53:56.901 --> 53:57.835
And make sure
I get that hanky back.

53:57.868 --> 53:58.803
I'll take
the machine back.

53:58.836 --> 54:00.237
You got it, Phil.

54:03.073 --> 54:04.041
You'll be okay,
Julian.

54:04.074 --> 54:05.976
They'll take good care
of you at the clinic.

54:06.010 --> 54:07.845
Don't worry, sweetie,
he'll be fine.

54:07.878 --> 54:08.813
You just
enjoy yourself.

54:08.846 --> 54:10.481
Lou and I will make sure

54:10.515 --> 54:11.649
we get that, uh, lure
pulled out of his--

54:11.682 --> 54:13.351
Leg.

54:13.384 --> 54:14.552
And when you get
to the clinic,

54:14.585 --> 54:16.321
have them page
Dr. Schmidt.

54:16.354 --> 54:17.555
Dr. Schmidt?

54:17.588 --> 54:20.057
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait!

54:20.090 --> 54:22.427
Wait! No! Not Dr. Schmidt!

54:23.728 --> 54:25.530
Not Dr. Schmidt!

54:28.799 --> 54:30.768
I'm sorry for
what Julian said earlier.

54:30.801 --> 54:32.637
Sometimes, he just can't see
past the win.

54:32.670 --> 54:33.704
Oh, that's okay.

54:33.738 --> 54:34.772
Have you had a chance

54:34.805 --> 54:35.906
to check out
any of the scenery yet?

54:35.940 --> 54:37.675
Are you kidding?

54:37.708 --> 54:39.977
Really?
Well, come on, then.

54:43.047 --> 54:45.383
[starts snowmobile engine]

54:53.123 --> 54:54.492
Ready?

55:01.966 --> 55:08.339
[***]

55:16.981 --> 55:20.084
[***]

55:32.062 --> 55:37.101
[***]

55:37.134 --> 55:40.771
It is so beautiful.

55:40.805 --> 55:43.073
Yeah, just wait for it.

55:57.888 --> 55:59.657
You know, the first time

55:59.690 --> 56:01.392
I saw the sun set
over these mountains,

56:01.426 --> 56:04.128
I thought, maybe there is
more for me

56:04.161 --> 56:06.096
than just hockey.

56:06.130 --> 56:08.065
I mean, I love the game.

56:08.098 --> 56:11.802
But I lost a lot when I quit.

56:13.438 --> 56:16.173
Chamonix's mom,
she, um...

56:16.206 --> 56:20.678
she walked out on us
when Chamonix was four.

56:20.711 --> 56:21.912
I couldn't do it anymore,

56:21.946 --> 56:24.114
piecing my body back together,

56:24.148 --> 56:25.616
pumping it with cortisone

56:25.650 --> 56:27.952
long enough
so I could keep winning.

56:27.985 --> 56:31.656
I knew, eventually,
the pieces would fall apart.

56:31.689 --> 56:34.759
Mine are already starting to.

56:34.792 --> 56:38.529
And I know you said
not to be scared, but...

56:38.563 --> 56:41.098
I am.

56:45.970 --> 56:47.705
So, what's
your story, huh?

56:47.738 --> 56:49.740
Why did you
start skating?

56:49.774 --> 56:52.209
My dad.

56:52.242 --> 56:54.912
He worked a lot,

56:54.945 --> 56:57.014
but the one thing
he always made time for

56:57.047 --> 56:58.849
was skating.

56:58.883 --> 57:00.618
He'd take me
to the local rink

57:00.651 --> 57:02.720
and we would just
skate for hours,

57:02.753 --> 57:05.022
until our toes
were numb.

57:05.055 --> 57:07.858
I loved it.

57:07.892 --> 57:10.094
It made me feel like
I was flying.

57:11.762 --> 57:12.930
It was my dad's idea

57:12.963 --> 57:14.865
to get me into
figure skating,

57:14.899 --> 57:16.567
and I won
my first trophy,

57:16.601 --> 57:20.137
and that was it,
I was hooked.

57:20.170 --> 57:24.775
That's all I've known
for 20 years.

57:24.809 --> 57:25.843
23 years.

57:25.876 --> 57:28.646
That's how long I played hockey.

57:28.679 --> 57:30.114
Wow.

57:30.147 --> 57:31.248
And like you,

57:31.281 --> 57:33.851
I couldn't imagine
anything else.

57:33.884 --> 57:35.520
But when I let it go,

57:35.553 --> 57:36.654
that's when I realized

57:36.687 --> 57:39.924
everything
I'd been missing out on.

57:39.957 --> 57:42.527
Having more days
to spend with Chamonix,

57:42.560 --> 57:43.694
watching the sun set...

57:45.963 --> 57:47.665
shoveling
my neighbor's driveway.

57:47.698 --> 57:50.735
Or, um...

57:50.768 --> 57:51.869
just spending time

57:51.902 --> 57:54.204
with someone
who makes me smile.

58:00.678 --> 58:02.146
[cell phone rings]

58:02.179 --> 58:04.515
[chuckles]

58:04.549 --> 58:07.652
What are the chances
I'd get a signal up here?

58:07.685 --> 58:08.953
Yeah, what are
the chances?

58:10.755 --> 58:12.923
It's probably Julian.

58:12.957 --> 58:15.092
I should go.

58:18.295 --> 58:19.697
Okay.

58:36.113 --> 58:39.617
It was a really nice day.

58:39.650 --> 58:41.185
Well, I'm pretty sure
you made my daughter's day.

58:41.218 --> 58:42.753
And mine.

58:44.321 --> 58:46.223
Maybe I could coach
Chamonix again tomorrow?

58:46.256 --> 58:48.659
She would love that.

58:48.693 --> 58:50.160
Okay.

58:50.194 --> 58:52.797
I'll meet you guys
at the rink, um, after 10:00?

58:52.830 --> 58:55.065
Yeah, we'll be there.

58:55.099 --> 58:56.734
Okay.

58:58.002 --> 58:59.570
I'm going to
go inside.

58:59.604 --> 59:00.571
Okay. Good night.

59:00.605 --> 59:01.606
Good night.

59:01.639 --> 59:02.607
[chuckling]

59:06.711 --> 59:08.012
[starts snowmobile engine]

59:10.080 --> 59:11.348
Hi.

59:11.381 --> 59:12.783
How is he doing?

59:12.817 --> 59:13.818
Happily sleeping,

59:13.851 --> 59:15.853
thanks to some
pain medication.

59:15.886 --> 59:16.887
And how are
you doing?

59:16.921 --> 59:18.355
Taking it easy,
I hope?

59:18.388 --> 59:20.190
Actually, I have been
resting a bit.

59:20.224 --> 59:21.626
Good.

59:21.659 --> 59:23.060
I'll see you
tomorrow for physio.

59:23.093 --> 59:24.128
Okay.

59:27.698 --> 59:30.134
[***]

59:42.146 --> 59:44.849
[Dale and Lou laughing]

59:49.086 --> 59:50.755
Well, um...

59:50.788 --> 59:52.957
thank you for
a wonderful evening.

59:52.990 --> 59:54.625
Thank you.

59:56.060 --> 59:58.729
Until we meet again.

01:00:02.299 --> 01:00:03.634
Good night.

01:00:04.702 --> 01:00:06.203
Good night.

01:00:18.916 --> 01:00:20.985
[giggles]

01:00:23.988 --> 01:00:26.390
That's right,
and one more time.

01:00:26.423 --> 01:00:27.624
[laughing]

01:00:29.026 --> 01:00:31.228
[groaning in pain]

01:00:42.072 --> 01:00:45.943
[Claire's cell phone rings]

01:00:48.112 --> 01:00:50.047
[call ringing]

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:05.996
Good job.

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:07.297
Wait, I almost forgot.

01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:08.966
I made you something.

01:01:14.371 --> 01:01:16.306
Nice moves out there.

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:19.043
Daddy, do you have it?

01:01:19.076 --> 01:01:20.244
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I got it.

01:01:21.478 --> 01:01:22.747
There you go.

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:26.851
[gasps]

01:01:26.884 --> 01:01:28.418
Thank you, Chamonix.

01:01:28.452 --> 01:01:30.721
[laughs in delight]

01:01:30.755 --> 01:01:32.723
You can hang it
on your Christmas tree

01:01:32.757 --> 01:01:33.858
and make a wish.

01:01:33.891 --> 01:01:36.193
Unless you're
here for Christmas.

01:01:36.226 --> 01:01:38.228
Maybe you can hang it
on our Christmas tree.

01:01:38.262 --> 01:01:39.296
Oh, um...

01:01:39.329 --> 01:01:40.464
Well, I don't know if...

01:01:40.497 --> 01:01:43.033
Should we grab hot chocolates?

01:01:43.067 --> 01:01:44.869
Daddy, I have
an idea,

01:01:44.902 --> 01:01:46.436
you should come
skating with us?

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:48.505
Oh, I think
that's a great idea.

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:50.775
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

01:01:50.808 --> 01:01:52.743
I, uh, I didn't bring
my skates, sweetie.

01:01:52.777 --> 01:01:55.445
They always have
spare ones by the rink.

01:01:56.947 --> 01:01:58.382
[together]: Please?

01:01:58.415 --> 01:02:00.017
How can I say no to that?

01:02:32.917 --> 01:02:34.418
[***]

01:02:36.821 --> 01:02:38.288
Purple laces?

01:02:38.322 --> 01:02:39.389
It's all they had.

01:02:45.963 --> 01:02:48.398
I guess I should
give up my dream

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:50.034
of her becoming
a hockey player, huh?

01:02:50.067 --> 01:02:53.037
I'd say she'd probably
prefer pink skating costumes

01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:55.005
over goalie padding.

01:02:55.039 --> 01:02:56.106
[laughs]

01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:57.407
How about you?

01:02:57.441 --> 01:02:59.076
Do you ever
play hockey anymore?

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:00.144
Nah, not really.

01:03:00.177 --> 01:03:01.345
Why not?
You said you loved it.

01:03:01.378 --> 01:03:02.512
I guess after a while,

01:03:02.546 --> 01:03:04.014
I just stopped thinking
about playing.

01:03:04.048 --> 01:03:05.082
I guess I was afraid

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:06.316
if I picked a stick
back up again,

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:07.952
I'd regret walking away.

01:03:09.253 --> 01:03:10.888
Well, I know that
when it's my time to walk away,

01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:12.189
I'll always skate,

01:03:12.222 --> 01:03:14.424
because when you
love something that much,

01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:17.027
you shouldn't let it go.

01:03:17.061 --> 01:03:19.363
[***]

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:24.234
All right.

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:30.374
What you got?

01:03:44.221 --> 01:03:45.822
All right.
Fair enough.

01:04:00.938 --> 01:04:02.272
Lovely.

01:04:02.306 --> 01:04:03.273
Perhaps just
a little unsteady

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:04.441
on the last
half rotation,

01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:06.911
but other than that,
not bad.

01:04:06.944 --> 01:04:08.879
Claire, I see you've been using
your practice time wisely.

01:04:08.913 --> 01:04:09.980
I mean, it's not like

01:04:10.014 --> 01:04:11.481
you've got a competition
to be ready for

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:12.883
in two weeks.

01:04:12.917 --> 01:04:14.518
I didn't see
any harm in--

01:04:14.551 --> 01:04:15.619
It's my fault.

01:04:15.652 --> 01:04:18.355
She was actually just doing
me and Chamonix a favor.

01:04:18.388 --> 01:04:20.257
But she does have
a real knack for coaching.

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:21.926
Oh, well.

01:04:21.959 --> 01:04:24.361
When she goes on to win
a championship like me,

01:04:24.394 --> 01:04:26.396
then she can coach
to her heart's content,

01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:28.899
but until then, she's all mine.

01:04:30.968 --> 01:04:32.169
And as you're all warmed up,

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:33.203
I guess we should
get started, huh?

01:04:33.237 --> 01:04:35.272
Before
the ice melts?

01:04:35.305 --> 01:04:36.606
Actually, Julian,

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.209
I'm just going to
let my body rest.

01:04:39.243 --> 01:04:40.410
Besides, I have
that physio appointment

01:04:40.444 --> 01:04:41.478
in less than
an hour anyway.

01:04:42.646 --> 01:04:44.348
Chamonix, I'll see you
later, okay?

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:47.217
Bye.

01:04:50.687 --> 01:04:52.656
[sighs heavily]

01:04:58.595 --> 01:05:00.998
Uncle Lou,
guess what?

01:05:01.031 --> 01:05:02.299
Daddy was skating
with me and Claire.

01:05:02.332 --> 01:05:04.201
Oh...

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:06.470
He was, was he?

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:10.474
Well, I think Daddy might have
been showing off for a girl.

01:05:10.507 --> 01:05:13.377
Daddy, do you
like Claire?

01:05:14.611 --> 01:05:16.146
Uh, Lou, did, uh,

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:17.247
did that ski wax
we ordered come in?

01:05:17.281 --> 01:05:19.283
She's real
pretty, Daddy.

01:05:19.316 --> 01:05:20.517
And she skates.

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:21.585
You like to skate,
right, Daddy?

01:05:23.453 --> 01:05:25.622
You know what, Chamonix.

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:27.457
I think
our good friend, Lou, here

01:05:27.491 --> 01:05:29.693
might have a little bit
of a crush on Claire's mom.

01:05:29.726 --> 01:05:32.296
Uncle Lou, is that true?

01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:33.563
Yeah, is it?

01:05:33.597 --> 01:05:36.166
I'm going to go look
for the ski wax.

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:40.170
Are you going to
marry her?

01:05:40.204 --> 01:05:41.205
Nope.

01:05:41.238 --> 01:05:42.172
How old is she?

01:05:42.206 --> 01:05:43.407
Don't care.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.441
Is she going to
come live here?

01:05:44.474 --> 01:05:46.010
Thanks, Luke!

01:05:54.284 --> 01:05:56.420
[laughing in triumph]

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:57.721
The tendons aren't as tight.

01:05:57.754 --> 01:05:58.755
See?

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:01.058
That's what resting
just for a couple of days

01:06:01.091 --> 01:06:02.059
will do.

01:06:02.092 --> 01:06:03.160
Good, good.

01:06:03.193 --> 01:06:04.094
We can finally
get back to working

01:06:04.128 --> 01:06:05.162
on your triple axel.

01:06:05.195 --> 01:06:06.663
Oh, I didn't say
she was healed.

01:06:06.696 --> 01:06:07.631
That will still take time.

01:06:07.664 --> 01:06:09.333
We don't have time.

01:06:09.366 --> 01:06:11.768
The body is on
its own schedule, not yours.

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:13.737
Hmm, unless
we help it along

01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:16.006
a little bit.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.241
I wouldn't
recommend that.

01:06:17.274 --> 01:06:18.342
It's fine,
it's okay.

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:19.676
Claire has used
cortisone before.

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:22.079
Let's just do it.

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:27.084
Actually, no.

01:06:27.117 --> 01:06:28.518
I don't want it.

01:06:28.552 --> 01:06:30.587
Not anymore.

01:06:48.138 --> 01:06:49.506
Claire...

01:06:51.441 --> 01:06:52.476
Claire.

01:06:55.179 --> 01:06:56.813
What's going on?

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:59.083
What's wrong
with you?

01:06:59.116 --> 01:07:01.151
There's nothing wrong
with me, Julian.

01:07:01.185 --> 01:07:02.486
Really?

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:03.787
Because you're not acting

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:05.222
like the athlete
I signed on with.

01:07:05.255 --> 01:07:07.091
And I only agreed
to coach you

01:07:07.124 --> 01:07:08.758
because you have
the same drive as me.

01:07:08.792 --> 01:07:11.027
I won't let you
ruin my record, Claire.

01:07:12.162 --> 01:07:14.198
Well, I'm sorry about
your record,

01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:16.400
but this is about me.

01:07:16.433 --> 01:07:18.235
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, whoa.

01:07:18.268 --> 01:07:20.337
You?
This is about you?

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:22.106
I want this, I do,

01:07:22.139 --> 01:07:24.474
but I can't keep pushing
if my body can't do it.

01:07:24.508 --> 01:07:25.742
That's nonsense.

01:07:25.775 --> 01:07:27.644
The ability to be able to do it
is all up here.

01:07:27.677 --> 01:07:28.845
No, Julian,

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:31.281
it's here.

01:07:31.315 --> 01:07:35.119
And my heart is telling me
something different.

01:07:36.186 --> 01:07:37.521
Claire...

01:07:40.857 --> 01:07:43.593
You promised me
you wouldn't give up.

01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:55.539
Oh, Claire, I was
just coming to see

01:07:55.572 --> 01:07:56.773
if you could join me
for dinner later.

01:07:56.806 --> 01:07:59.109
I found this adorable
little creperie

01:07:59.143 --> 01:08:00.277
when Lou took me
on a tour.

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:02.546
Thanks, Mom,
but I'm not that hungry.

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:03.580
I'll see you later, okay?

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:15.792
Sorry, we're just closing up.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:17.861
Julian.

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:20.397
Can I help you
with something?

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:23.733
I hope you can.

01:08:23.767 --> 01:08:25.402
You see, it appears Claire
isn't quite as focused

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:26.903
as she was
before she got here,

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:28.638
and I'm guessing it has
something to do

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:30.607
with a retired hockey player.

01:08:39.183 --> 01:08:40.850
I'm not telling her
what to do

01:08:40.884 --> 01:08:42.919
if that's what you're thinking.

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:44.754
Clearly, that's your job.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:46.723
Exactly.

01:08:46.756 --> 01:08:48.558
It's my job to make sure

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:50.627
she achieves
what she's always wanted,

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:54.198
and being a world champion
is what she's always wanted.

01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:55.932
I mean, maybe you
gave up on the dream,

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:58.268
but believe me,

01:08:58.301 --> 01:08:59.536
Claire will regret it.

01:08:59.569 --> 01:09:01.938
She will regret it
if she doesn't go for it.

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:03.573
I should know,

01:09:03.607 --> 01:09:05.475
I've been training her
for the last three years.

01:09:05.509 --> 01:09:07.411
I've been there
when she's struggled,

01:09:07.444 --> 01:09:09.246
when she's been so close
she could almost taste it,

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:11.581
and when she's soared
because she got it.

01:09:12.716 --> 01:09:14.484
And I just don't think

01:09:14.518 --> 01:09:16.653
that you can say the same

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:18.555
in the few weeks
you've known her.

01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:21.325
And I'm sure you don't
want to be the one

01:09:21.358 --> 01:09:22.426
who crushes her dreams,

01:09:22.459 --> 01:09:24.294
because if you do,

01:09:24.328 --> 01:09:26.630
she will never forgive you.

01:09:55.392 --> 01:09:56.726
I love to skate, Daddy!

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.295
I feel like I'm flying!

01:09:58.328 --> 01:09:59.396
I know you do,

01:09:59.429 --> 01:10:00.897
but, sweetie, your nose
is turning blue.

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:02.399
Just a little longer?

01:10:02.432 --> 01:10:03.967
Please!

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.336
Okay, let's go.

01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:07.937
Come on, let's go, Daddy!

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:24.954
Hey.

01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:27.491
Hey.

01:10:27.524 --> 01:10:30.460
Could I, uh,
bend your ear a bit maybe?

01:10:30.494 --> 01:10:31.961
What about?

01:10:31.995 --> 01:10:33.763
It's Julian.

01:10:33.797 --> 01:10:35.599
He, um...

01:10:35.632 --> 01:10:37.734
he wanted me to get
a cortisone shot.

01:10:37.767 --> 01:10:40.270
You know, to help me along
with this competition,

01:10:40.304 --> 01:10:42.038
but I told him I didn't want it,

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:43.473
because...

01:10:43.507 --> 01:10:44.941
I mean,
it's like you said,

01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:46.743
there are only
so many times

01:10:46.776 --> 01:10:49.513
I can keep putting the pieces
back together again.

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:51.715
So, uh,

01:10:51.748 --> 01:10:53.917
I have a feeling that
after this competition,

01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:55.752
that'll be it,

01:10:55.785 --> 01:11:00.890
which means
that I can go ahead, and...

01:11:00.924 --> 01:11:03.026
I don't know,

01:11:03.059 --> 01:11:05.995
see what else
is out there for me.

01:11:09.366 --> 01:11:10.434
Are you sure about that?

01:11:10.467 --> 01:11:11.301
I mean, maybe it's...

01:11:11.335 --> 01:11:12.902
maybe it's not
the right time to quit.

01:11:12.936 --> 01:11:15.038
What makes you say that?

01:11:15.071 --> 01:11:16.573
I know how this place

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:20.076
can make you feel
lost in the moment.

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:22.346
I think it's important
you stay focused on your dreams.

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.815
Daddy!

01:11:25.849 --> 01:11:27.083
Claire, look,

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.418
I got a gingerbread kit.

01:11:28.452 --> 01:11:30.920
Maybe you can
help me do it.

01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:33.089
You know,
I don't think so, honey,

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:35.692
Claire's got a very
important competition

01:11:35.725 --> 01:11:36.760
to prepare for,

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:38.362
and we shouldn't
bother her.

01:11:38.395 --> 01:11:40.063
Come on, let's
get you home.

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:45.034
It's probably
just, um...

01:11:45.068 --> 01:11:46.803
It's a school night.

01:11:47.871 --> 01:11:48.905
Right.

01:11:48.938 --> 01:11:49.906
Yeah.

01:11:54.978 --> 01:11:56.079
Okay, sweetie,

01:11:56.112 --> 01:11:57.514
only a couple more
days of school,

01:11:57.547 --> 01:11:58.882
and then
Christmas break.

01:11:58.915 --> 01:11:59.949
[horn honking outside]

01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:01.485
Oh, that's your bus.

01:12:01.518 --> 01:12:02.719
Have a great day.

01:12:02.752 --> 01:12:03.753
I love you.

01:12:03.787 --> 01:12:05.455
I love you, too, Dad.

01:12:22.606 --> 01:12:23.773
Hey...

01:12:25.942 --> 01:12:29.579
Do you want me to charge Phil
for the skate sharpening?

01:12:29.613 --> 01:12:31.114
Yeah, sure.

01:12:31.147 --> 01:12:33.116
How much?

01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:35.619
I don't know,
15, 20?

01:12:35.652 --> 01:12:37.754
And what about his reel?

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:39.723
Same thing?

01:12:40.957 --> 01:12:41.991
All right,
what's going on?

01:12:42.025 --> 01:12:43.660
What?

01:12:43.693 --> 01:12:45.629
You haven't charged
Phil for anything

01:12:45.662 --> 01:12:47.130
since the day
we've opened,

01:12:47.163 --> 01:12:48.732
so what's muddling
that brain of yours?

01:12:49.966 --> 01:12:51.868
Is it Peter Pan boots again?

01:12:51.901 --> 01:12:53.637
No.

01:12:53.670 --> 01:12:55.171
No, and besides, it's not like

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:56.940
she's ever going to
come back here or anything.

01:12:56.973 --> 01:12:59.776
Well, not unless
you ask her to.

01:12:59.809 --> 01:13:01.077
Why would I do that, Lou?

01:13:02.946 --> 01:13:04.714
I mean, she's got a career.

01:13:04.748 --> 01:13:06.783
And it's just like
her coach said,

01:13:06.816 --> 01:13:08.418
just because I quit

01:13:08.452 --> 01:13:09.152
doesn't mean
I should be convincing her

01:13:09.185 --> 01:13:10.186
to do the same thing.

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.556
What does that scarf-wearing
troll know anyway?

01:13:12.589 --> 01:13:14.891
He knows Claire
a lot more than I do.

01:13:14.924 --> 01:13:16.159
Hey, he may have
known her longer,

01:13:16.192 --> 01:13:18.795
but you know exactly
what she's going through.

01:13:20.196 --> 01:13:21.831
When you first came
to this mountain,

01:13:21.865 --> 01:13:22.899
you were a wreck.

01:13:22.932 --> 01:13:23.867
I mean, heck,
even today,

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.669
you won't
pick up a stick,

01:13:25.702 --> 01:13:27.571
or play shinny,
or nothin'.

01:13:27.604 --> 01:13:30.507
So if she's gonna get
to the other side of this,

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:32.008
she's going to need
someone like you

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:35.545
who's been through it before.

01:13:35.579 --> 01:13:36.780
Besides, if you ask me,

01:13:36.813 --> 01:13:37.781
you two were meant
for each other.

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:42.886
So, what are you doing here?

01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:44.888
Come on, I'll close up.

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:46.055
You go tell her how you feel,

01:13:46.089 --> 01:13:48.191
so I don't have to pull you
out of the doldrums again.

01:13:48.224 --> 01:13:49.826
Nah, I don't want to--

01:13:49.859 --> 01:13:51.528
Come on,
listen to me...

01:13:52.829 --> 01:13:54.564
Go, okay?
Come on.

01:13:54.598 --> 01:13:56.132
Get outta here.

01:13:56.165 --> 01:13:57.133
You sure?

01:13:57.166 --> 01:13:58.835
Yes, I'm sure.

01:14:00.003 --> 01:14:01.037
Okay.

01:14:03.206 --> 01:14:04.541
Thanks, Lou.

01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:05.909
No problem.

01:14:07.977 --> 01:14:09.779
[***]

01:14:28.898 --> 01:14:30.834
Chop chop, ladies,
we've got a plane to catch.

01:14:49.753 --> 01:14:51.855
Claire?

01:14:51.888 --> 01:14:53.523
Claire, is this
what you really want?

01:14:53.557 --> 01:14:55.525
Mom, let's just go.

01:14:57.961 --> 01:15:00.129
Okay, ladies!

01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:01.665
First, Nationals,

01:15:01.698 --> 01:15:03.967
and then we're off
to the World Championships.

01:15:08.204 --> 01:15:10.540
[***]

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.114
Hey, Patty,

01:15:18.147 --> 01:15:19.749
could you tell me
where to find Claire?

01:15:19.783 --> 01:15:21.718
Oh, sorry, Luke,
you just missed them.

01:15:21.751 --> 01:15:24.754
Ms. Benson and her party
already checked out.

01:15:24.788 --> 01:15:26.289
-She's gone?
-That's right.

01:15:26.322 --> 01:15:28.658
Ms. Benson left you something.

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:47.744
"He sprang
to his sleigh,

01:15:47.777 --> 01:15:50.013
to his team
gave a whistle..."

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:53.783
"And away they flew
like the down of a thistle."

01:15:53.817 --> 01:15:57.587
"But I heard him exclaim
ere he drove out of sight.."

01:15:57.621 --> 01:15:59.255
"Merry Christmas to all..."

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:02.025
[together]:
"and to all a good night."

01:16:03.292 --> 01:16:06.562
Daddy, will Claire
ever come back?

01:16:08.865 --> 01:16:11.234
I don't think so, sweetheart,

01:16:11.267 --> 01:16:13.102
but we can get you
another figure skating coach.

01:16:13.136 --> 01:16:16.272
Not like Claire.

01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:22.045
Come on,
let's get you to bed.

01:16:29.753 --> 01:16:31.387
All right,
little miss,

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.822
get some sleep.

01:16:32.856 --> 01:16:35.291
Christmas is just
a few days away.

01:16:35.324 --> 01:16:37.894
Sweet dreams.

01:17:10.927 --> 01:17:11.928
Okay, that's it!

01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:13.763
Good, turn! Turn!

01:17:17.834 --> 01:17:19.903
Let's go again, okay?

01:17:19.936 --> 01:17:21.337
Bring it!

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:24.340
Turn, and lift!

01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:26.309
That's right, that's my girl!

01:17:26.342 --> 01:17:28.244
Okay, let's go again.

01:17:33.449 --> 01:17:34.984
You got a tree.

01:17:35.018 --> 01:17:37.787
Of course, it's Christmas.

01:17:37.821 --> 01:17:39.923
How was practice?

01:17:39.956 --> 01:17:42.025
It was fine.

01:17:42.058 --> 01:17:43.927
Hey, give me a hand.

01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:48.732
Do you remember

01:17:48.765 --> 01:17:50.399
the Christmas you got
your first pair of skates?

01:17:50.433 --> 01:17:52.001
Yeah.

01:17:52.035 --> 01:17:53.469
They were the ones
with the pink laces.

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:54.904
[chuckles]

01:17:54.938 --> 01:17:56.405
That's right.

01:17:56.439 --> 01:17:59.876
Oh, my goodness,
your father was so excited.

01:17:59.909 --> 01:18:01.811
He couldn't wait to get you
out there on the ice

01:18:01.845 --> 01:18:03.412
to teach you to skate.

01:18:03.446 --> 01:18:05.214
And then, when you
came back from the rink,

01:18:05.248 --> 01:18:09.185
he was beaming with pride
that you caught on so fast.

01:18:09.218 --> 01:18:10.754
[chuckles]

01:18:10.787 --> 01:18:11.855
And you were glowing.

01:18:11.888 --> 01:18:15.058
You had so much fun.

01:18:16.492 --> 01:18:20.329
And if it ever stopped
being fun, I think...

01:18:20.363 --> 01:18:23.132
I think that would have
broken his heart.

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:49.759
[***]

01:19:10.914 --> 01:19:12.949
Okay, when you set up
for your triple axel,

01:19:12.982 --> 01:19:15.084
I want you
to bring that energy, okay?

01:19:15.118 --> 01:19:16.185
That power we talked about.

01:19:16.219 --> 01:19:18.121
This is no time
for hesitation. Yeah?

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:20.756
[crowd cheering]

01:19:22.892 --> 01:19:24.160
[female commentator]:
And a wonderful performance

01:19:24.193 --> 01:19:25.494
by Anna Wolk.

01:19:30.867 --> 01:19:32.802
Okay, Claire,
this is it.

01:19:32.836 --> 01:19:35.071
This is our time.

01:19:36.305 --> 01:19:37.273
Okay.

01:19:38.407 --> 01:19:40.576
[commentator]: And now
on the ice is Claire Benson,

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:43.246
who cinched silver
at last years Nationals,

01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:44.347
after failing to land
her triple axel,

01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:45.414
costing her the gold.

01:19:45.448 --> 01:19:46.482
That's right,

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:47.650
but if she can nail

01:19:47.683 --> 01:19:49.385
-that triple axel today...
-Come on, Claire, come on!

01:19:49.418 --> 01:19:52.155
...maybe she'll finally
get that gold

01:19:52.188 --> 01:19:54.057
and a spot
at the World Championships.

01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:57.026
Dad, come quick,
Claire's on TV.

01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:59.362
[crowd cheering]

01:19:59.395 --> 01:20:03.332
[***]

01:20:14.911 --> 01:20:16.279
Yes!

01:20:22.085 --> 01:20:23.552
[***]

01:20:23.586 --> 01:20:25.989
You can
do this, Claire.

01:20:26.022 --> 01:20:27.523
[***]

01:20:28.925 --> 01:20:30.059
[Chamonix]: She looks pretty,
doesn't she?

01:20:34.563 --> 01:20:38.601
[***]

01:20:57.921 --> 01:20:59.655
[crowd gasps and cheers]

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:04.393
[***]

01:21:10.333 --> 01:21:11.500
Yes!

01:21:13.002 --> 01:21:14.137
[commentator]:
And she's done it!

01:21:14.170 --> 01:21:16.940
A perfect triple axel.
Incredible!

01:21:16.973 --> 01:21:19.442
[whistling in triumph]

01:21:19.475 --> 01:21:22.178
[***]

01:21:22.211 --> 01:21:26.149
[crowd cheering and applauding]

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:37.961
[crowd screaming and cheering]

01:21:43.566 --> 01:21:44.934
Yeah!

01:21:44.968 --> 01:21:46.936
That's my girl!

01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:50.273
Oh, we did it,
we did it, we did it!

01:21:50.306 --> 01:21:51.941
Oh, wow!

01:21:51.975 --> 01:21:55.511
Okay, now we train
for Worlds, right?

01:21:55.544 --> 01:21:58.514
Actually, Julian, I'm done.

01:21:58.547 --> 01:21:59.648
Sure, yeah,
of course,

01:21:59.682 --> 01:22:00.649
we can take
a bit of a break.

01:22:00.683 --> 01:22:02.118
A couple of days
over Christmas.

01:22:02.151 --> 01:22:04.687
No, I mean,
I'm done competing.

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:05.955
What are you
talking about?

01:22:05.989 --> 01:22:07.456
You just secured
a spot at Worlds.

01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:09.492
I know. I'm sorry.

01:22:09.525 --> 01:22:11.294
You're sorry?

01:22:11.327 --> 01:22:13.729
Claire, this is what
you've always wanted.

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:15.131
You can't walk away now.

01:22:15.164 --> 01:22:16.465
It was
what I wanted,

01:22:16.499 --> 01:22:17.700
but I told you,

01:22:17.733 --> 01:22:20.103
I can't keep putting my body
through this,

01:22:20.136 --> 01:22:24.173
and as scared as I am
to walk away,

01:22:24.207 --> 01:22:26.375
I know it's going to be okay.

01:22:26.409 --> 01:22:28.411
[stammering] What...
what am I supposed to do now?

01:22:38.121 --> 01:22:39.388
I think there's
a new skater on the circuit

01:22:39.422 --> 01:22:42.358
who could use
a coach like you.

01:22:49.032 --> 01:22:51.567
Anna, great job out there.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:54.403
Perhaps more extension,
but we can work on that.

01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:01.677
[***]

01:23:14.257 --> 01:23:16.525
That was a cool spin.

01:23:16.559 --> 01:23:18.027
Yeah, it was.

01:23:20.163 --> 01:23:22.131
Merry Christmas!

01:23:22.165 --> 01:23:23.399
Claire, you came back!

01:23:23.432 --> 01:23:24.633
[laughing happily]

01:23:24.667 --> 01:23:26.202
I did.

01:23:26.235 --> 01:23:27.470
Do you have to leave again?

01:23:27.503 --> 01:23:29.038
Well, I don't want to.

01:23:29.072 --> 01:23:30.306
What I really want

01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:32.141
is to be here skating,
with you.

01:23:32.175 --> 01:23:33.276
[giggles]

01:23:33.309 --> 01:23:35.211
I'm sorry, Claire,

01:23:35.244 --> 01:23:36.812
I thought I was
holding you back.

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:38.647
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

01:23:38.681 --> 01:23:40.683
You're not holding me
back from anything.

01:23:40.716 --> 01:23:43.719
Besides, my dreams have changed.

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:45.054
You're just
the one that showed me

01:23:45.088 --> 01:23:47.390
I have nothing
to be afraid of.

01:23:47.423 --> 01:23:48.457
I just know how hard
you've worked for it,

01:23:48.491 --> 01:23:49.758
and how bad you wanted it.

01:23:49.792 --> 01:23:53.129
Trust me, this is what I want.

01:23:53.162 --> 01:23:56.565
And I have so much more
to look forward to.

01:23:56.599 --> 01:23:59.068
I hope.

01:24:02.405 --> 01:24:04.207
You do.

01:24:12.181 --> 01:24:13.749
Got a s'more for me?

01:24:16.252 --> 01:24:18.854
Well, I got a s'more,
and a whole...

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:20.423
lot more.

01:24:20.456 --> 01:24:21.657
[laughs]

01:24:25.694 --> 01:24:27.196
Hey, loverboy!
You wanna play?

01:24:28.764 --> 01:24:30.599
What's happening?

01:24:30.633 --> 01:24:32.835
I just invited a few
of my old buddies out

01:24:32.868 --> 01:24:33.836
for a game of pick-up.

01:24:33.869 --> 01:24:35.238
You're going to play?

01:24:35.271 --> 01:24:36.839
Sure, why not?

01:24:36.872 --> 01:24:38.207
I love the game,

01:24:38.241 --> 01:24:39.275
and you're right,

01:24:39.308 --> 01:24:40.643
if you love something,
you don't ever let it go.

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:45.148
What's this?

01:24:45.181 --> 01:24:46.182
I don't know
how to play hockey.

01:24:46.215 --> 01:24:47.883
Well, it's my turn
to teach you.

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:49.552
Okay.

01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:50.519
So you hold it
with your good hand...

01:24:50.553 --> 01:24:52.121
All right.

01:24:52.155 --> 01:24:53.122
And when
you get the puck,

01:24:53.156 --> 01:24:54.323
you go back and forth,

01:24:54.357 --> 01:24:56.492
and try and get it
from them.

01:24:56.525 --> 01:24:57.860
Yeah? Just try
and steal it from them?

01:24:57.893 --> 01:24:59.162
That's whatcha do.

01:24:59.195 --> 01:25:00.263
What am I
doing wrong here?

01:25:00.296 --> 01:25:01.797
[laughing happily]

01:25:06.235 --> 01:25:11.540
[***]
