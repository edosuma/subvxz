[gruff voice] Armageddon will launch
in one minute.

01:41.791 --> 01:44.541
[girl] Tony, how are we gonna
do this in time?

01:45.541 --> 01:49.458
-We need to get across that gap.
-But we'll be spotted by the guards.

01:49.541 --> 01:51.875
-We won't make it.
-Can you just trust me?

01:51.958 --> 01:55.041
Honestly? No, I can't trust you.

01:56.083 --> 01:58.958
Well, we're going anyway.
Activate Magna Boots.

01:59.041 --> 02:00.375
[boots bleep and whir]

02:00.458 --> 02:01.458
Activated.

[mechanical stomping]

02:14.916 --> 02:17.125
-[Tony] Look out. Guards.
-[girl] Sh!

02:17.208 --> 02:19.208
[dramatic music intensifies]

02:26.416 --> 02:28.083
-I need eyes in the hall.
-On it.

02:30.208 --> 02:32.666
Bronson, surveillance mode.

02:34.291 --> 02:35.500
Tony, we gotta hurry!

02:36.500 --> 02:38.041
Locked out. Again.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.916
This is where
we're supposed to complete the mission!

02:41.000 --> 02:44.041
If we get to this elevator,
we can stop the countdown.

02:44.125 --> 02:47.458
Tony, the world as we know it
ends in 15 seconds.

02:51.958 --> 02:54.625
[gruff voice]
You will never stop Armageddon.

02:54.708 --> 02:55.916
Run to the elevator.

03:02.125 --> 03:03.583
[device buzzes]

03:03.666 --> 03:04.708
Do it again!

03:09.583 --> 03:11.000
[girl exhales]

03:11.083 --> 03:13.083
I think you were right, Patty.

03:13.916 --> 03:14.916
About what?

03:16.291 --> 03:17.916
We're not gonna make it.

03:20.166 --> 03:22.166
-[clunking]

04:01.458 --> 04:03.750
Rat Thickskull, don't let me down.

04:05.083 --> 04:08.583
You know, back in my day,
a card up the sleeve was called cheating.

04:08.666 --> 04:11.000
Morning, Dad.
I'm learning a new magic trick.

04:11.083 --> 04:12.416
Oh, is that right?

04:12.500 --> 04:16.000
I never cheat.
I use creative sportsmanship.

04:16.083 --> 04:19.041
[giggles] Oh, that's very clever.
Where'd you get that term?

04:19.125 --> 04:20.916
-From you.
-[gasps]

04:21.000 --> 04:24.125
From me?! Oh, no, no. That's impossible.

04:24.208 --> 04:27.458
Deception is not a part of my vocabulary.
[clicks tongue]

04:32.958 --> 04:35.083
Don't you like your overnight oats?

04:35.583 --> 04:37.041
[Patty] Mmm…

04:37.125 --> 04:38.250
Blame your dad.

04:38.333 --> 04:40.666
Uh, excuse me. What's going on here?

04:40.750 --> 04:44.041
Computers, games, devices are
only allowed between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m.

04:44.125 --> 04:46.500
-We know this.
-She just needs it for a minute.

04:46.583 --> 04:50.708
I'm looking for an animal photo
to make my science paper look extra nice.

04:50.791 --> 04:54.875
Oh, well, as long as it's for schoolwork,
then I guess it's okay.

04:54.958 --> 04:59.291
As soon as she's done, we lock that up,
and then please meet me in our office.

04:59.375 --> 05:00.291
Mm-hmm.

05:00.875 --> 05:03.541
Aw, look at that cute little starfish.

05:03.625 --> 05:04.708
Aw.

05:05.208 --> 05:06.083
[Patty] Boop.

05:06.166 --> 05:08.833
I need your permission to download it.

05:08.916 --> 05:13.166
Mm-hmm. I'm very impressed
with how honest you are, sweetheart.

05:13.250 --> 05:16.416
Yep. I always wanna be super honest.

05:16.500 --> 05:17.750
Just like you.

05:18.416 --> 05:19.583
Hmm.

05:21.625 --> 05:24.458
Switchsies. Thank you, my love.

05:26.666 --> 05:28.000
-Morning, Mom.
-Hey.

05:28.833 --> 05:31.041
-Games?
-I gotta practice for tonight.

05:31.125 --> 05:32.541
Do you wanna get busted?

05:33.250 --> 05:35.416
Nobody catches Rat.

05:35.500 --> 05:40.458
-Stop talking like Rat Thickskull.
-Someday, I'm gonna be Rat Thickskull.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.500
Really?

05:42.083 --> 05:43.875

05:52.500 --> 05:54.083
-[fingers crack]
-All right.

05:54.958 --> 05:57.291
Authorizing Armageddon Code.

05:59.375 --> 06:01.041
Syncing Armageddon Code.

06:03.208 --> 06:05.666
And Armageddon Code sunk.

06:07.208 --> 06:09.625
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Come here.

06:09.708 --> 06:10.833
Hey. [chuckles] What?

06:11.833 --> 06:12.916
Happy anniversary.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.250
Operation Fireball?

06:16.833 --> 06:18.000
[both] Pssch!

06:18.083 --> 06:20.541
How could I forget
our greatest mission yet?

06:20.625 --> 06:22.916
-[beeping]
-Oh, oh, oh, oh. Mm.

06:24.750 --> 06:27.416
-You did remember.
-Well, my watch did anyway.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.375
We also promised
that it was this anniversary

06:30.458 --> 06:34.083
we were finally gonna tell our kids
that we're spies.

06:34.166 --> 06:36.416
-Remember?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, we did.

06:36.500 --> 06:40.041
I say we go in and say, "Tonight,
we're gonna have an important talk."

06:40.125 --> 06:44.541
-And I'm gonna take the lead on that.
-Oh no. N… I know what you're doing.

06:44.625 --> 06:47.250
-Trying to dance your way out of this one.
-I would never!

06:47.333 --> 06:49.458
How dare you tango with me!

06:50.041 --> 06:52.416
[mom] You know I love it
when you dance with me.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.625
-Let's go talk to the kids.
-Okay.

06:57.833 --> 06:59.833
-Antonio.
-Hi.

07:02.083 --> 07:05.000
Oh good. It's locked. Just making sure.

07:05.083 --> 07:09.125
You know better than to fry your brain
with video games before school.

07:10.125 --> 07:12.958
For breaking the rules
and stealing my key,

07:13.041 --> 07:16.958
you will have no access to any tech
of any kind for the rest of the week.

07:17.041 --> 07:18.583
Okay. Now tell them.

07:21.541 --> 07:22.375
Kids.

07:23.083 --> 07:23.958
[mom] Hmm.

07:26.041 --> 07:28.125
Onward to the house of learning!

07:28.208 --> 07:30.500
-Nice leading.
-We can tell 'em next year.

07:30.583 --> 07:34.666
-We've said that since they were four.
-[dad] Here we go!

07:35.708 --> 07:37.958
Tony keeps getting around
our restrictions,

07:38.041 --> 07:40.250
so we have to ban all of their technology.

07:40.333 --> 07:42.791
They need time
to enjoy the things they love.

07:42.875 --> 07:45.625
Babe, we can't risk
someone breaking into our system

07:45.708 --> 07:47.625
through our kids' devices, okay?

07:47.708 --> 07:50.166
There are spies everywhere.

07:50.250 --> 07:52.250
[funky music playing]

07:53.458 --> 07:55.458
[device whirs]

07:58.375 --> 08:00.708
Agent Torrez. Agent Tango.

08:00.791 --> 08:01.750
Morning, Devlin.

08:02.333 --> 08:04.166
So what's the mission for today?

08:04.250 --> 08:08.833
An unknown group has infiltrated one
of the top secret server rooms of the OSS

08:08.916 --> 08:11.416
hidden deep inside a civilian office.

08:13.041 --> 08:14.875
These guys look like professionals.

08:14.958 --> 08:17.000
Mm. We'll pay them a visit.

08:18.125 --> 08:19.666
[suspenseful music playing]

08:27.166 --> 08:31.291
You know, because of our rules,
at least Patty is very honest.

08:31.375 --> 08:34.166
Our restrictions make them
do what is right,

08:34.250 --> 08:40.208
so if we ban all of their tech,
maybe they should behave even better.

08:40.291 --> 08:43.666
Look, all I'm saying is
technology isn't doing them any favors.

08:43.750 --> 08:44.750
Know what I mean?

08:45.250 --> 08:47.208
-[beeps]
-Someone's locked us out.

08:47.291 --> 08:49.125
[sinister music playing]

08:57.333 --> 09:00.541
-Well, technology sure serves us well.
-Hmm.

09:00.625 --> 09:02.333
[playful Latin music playing]

09:07.666 --> 09:11.541
Okay. The most optimal path
of capturing them all effectively is…

09:11.625 --> 09:12.958
is not that.

09:13.041 --> 09:15.791
-You don't think so?
-Don't be a bull in a china shop.

09:15.875 --> 09:17.500
[device bangs, fizzes]

09:18.208 --> 09:20.208
[blows landing]

09:23.458 --> 09:26.958
You know, we could have planned that
just a little, babe.

09:27.041 --> 09:30.583
Maybe ask one of these guys
what the passcode is or something.

09:30.666 --> 09:35.166
You think too much.
It's very cute though. Okay. [strains]

09:35.250 --> 09:38.250
You know,
we can't just control our children.

09:38.333 --> 09:41.000
We gotta let them fail.

09:41.083 --> 09:43.916
You know? A lot. Like we did.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.208
Through real-life experiences, absolutely,
but not through their technology.

09:48.291 --> 09:51.291
I mean, video games
are never a real challenge.

09:51.375 --> 09:52.458
Wait, what's this?

09:52.541 --> 09:58.166
-"Defeat the Heck Knight to gain access."
-This should be easy for you.

09:59.375 --> 10:00.458
Mira.

10:01.666 --> 10:03.875
[game character whooshing]

10:03.958 --> 10:05.208
Ha. Oh.

10:05.708 --> 10:07.541
Ooh. Ouch.

10:07.625 --> 10:10.125
Well, he cheated,
and two can play at that game.

10:10.208 --> 10:11.791
[watch bleeps]

10:13.541 --> 10:15.916
Armageddon really does
break into anything.

10:16.666 --> 10:17.583
What?

10:17.666 --> 10:19.083
This is odd.

10:19.166 --> 10:23.791
These guys
weren't actually searching for anything,

10:23.875 --> 10:26.708
so… what are they doing here?

10:27.333 --> 10:30.791
Oh, I count four intruders.
There was a fifth. That big one.

10:30.875 --> 10:33.625
-[tense music playing]
-[creaking]

10:34.166 --> 10:35.208
[thudding]

10:36.541 --> 10:37.875
Ah!

10:37.958 --> 10:39.833
Oh! Oh-ho! Oh!

10:42.291 --> 10:45.291
[gruff voice] Armageddon is mine to claim.

10:46.083 --> 10:47.250
Whoa!

10:47.333 --> 10:48.666
[grunts]

10:52.833 --> 10:54.000
-It was a trap.
-Huh?

10:54.083 --> 10:56.791
It was a trap.
They're after the Armageddon Code.

10:56.875 --> 10:57.958
-No.
-Come on.

11:00.083 --> 11:01.458
[Heck Knight growls]

11:01.541 --> 11:03.125
[bystanders scream]

11:07.416 --> 11:08.625
Oh, he's gone.

11:08.708 --> 11:11.250
It's okay.
Armageddon isn't stored on the watch.

11:11.333 --> 11:15.208
Mom. You missed it.
There was a Heck Knight. From Hyskor!

11:15.291 --> 11:17.833
[kid's mom] Sweetie, wait up.
Wait a minute.

11:18.666 --> 11:20.000
What's Hyskor?

11:20.500 --> 11:21.666
I…

11:21.750 --> 11:25.208
[host] This is the final round
of our trading-card tournament.

11:25.291 --> 11:29.333
The winner will receive
a free copy of Hyskor,

11:29.416 --> 11:34.708
which, of course, is the sequel
to the megahit video game Loskor.

11:34.791 --> 11:36.375
Players, are you ready?

11:37.541 --> 11:38.625
[host] Let's play.

11:39.541 --> 11:40.958
Lowest number wins.

11:41.041 --> 11:42.166
Beat that.

11:44.541 --> 11:46.208
Oh no.

11:47.166 --> 11:48.875
Or, as Rat Thickskull would say,

11:50.916 --> 11:52.375
"Tough tacos, kid."

11:52.458 --> 11:54.583
[cheering]

11:59.208 --> 12:00.416
I'm impressed.

12:02.250 --> 12:04.166
Congratulations, Tony.

12:04.250 --> 12:08.000
Type in your email and Hyskor will be sent
to your home computer.

12:10.166 --> 12:12.000
Did you know the creator of Hyskor

12:12.083 --> 12:15.666
is this crazy awesome rich guy
named Rey Kingston,

12:15.750 --> 12:18.375
but everyone calls him
by his gamer name, the King.

12:18.458 --> 12:19.333
Check it out.

12:19.416 --> 12:22.875
[narrator] And here is Rey Kingston
to talk about how he does it.

12:22.958 --> 12:24.875
My latest game, Hyskor,

12:24.958 --> 12:28.333
is made using
my new, flawless design method.

12:28.416 --> 12:30.208
That's a glitch right there.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.708
[laughter]

12:31.791 --> 12:34.208
But, using my proprietary…

12:34.291 --> 12:36.250
[computerized voice] VR pods.

12:36.333 --> 12:39.875
…I'm able to design and improve the game

12:40.708 --> 12:41.958
from the inside.

12:42.041 --> 12:43.291
Whoa.

12:43.916 --> 12:45.750
-With my mind.
-[bleeping]

12:45.833 --> 12:47.250
What?

12:47.333 --> 12:51.166
[The King] I can make my game better
so it can make you better.

12:53.833 --> 12:55.166
Will you look at that?

12:56.125 --> 12:58.708
-Better than ever!
-[kids] Whoa!

12:58.791 --> 13:01.375
And when you apply game theory,

13:02.625 --> 13:04.041
you can fix anything.

13:04.791 --> 13:06.500
[kids laugh]

13:07.375 --> 13:11.166
Do you think the game will have
the mythical One Hit from Loskor?

13:11.250 --> 13:12.958
No. One Hit is a fable.

13:13.041 --> 13:16.041
No, it isn't. Leebs and I
were fighting a cheating player,

13:16.125 --> 13:20.333
and I ran out of health,
but then I got a gold star,

13:20.416 --> 13:24.791
came back to life,
and beat the player with One Hit.

13:24.875 --> 13:26.333
That's impossible, Patty.

13:26.416 --> 13:30.041
Hyskor's releasing at midnight,
and I'm gonna play it all night long.

13:30.125 --> 13:33.041
My parents would never let me
stay up that late.

13:33.125 --> 13:36.083
We're not allowed
to stay up late playing games.

13:36.166 --> 13:39.083
You'll never make it past
Mom and Dad's restrictions.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.625
Not without your help.

13:41.875 --> 13:44.833
-You shouldn't have cheated.
-But I won, didn't I?

13:44.916 --> 13:46.625
There's a better way to win.

13:46.708 --> 13:49.708
But I got Hyskor.
I know you wanna play too.

13:50.916 --> 13:52.916
[ominous music playing]

13:54.833 --> 13:56.833
[Heck Knight growls]

14:01.375 --> 14:04.791
[The King] The world is full
of terrible, unfair people,

14:04.875 --> 14:09.416
but, with the Armageddon Code,
I can force them all to become good.

14:14.083 --> 14:16.916
[Heck Knight] We were unable
to trace the Armageddon Code

14:17.000 --> 14:18.750
through the agent's watch.

14:18.833 --> 14:20.583
But I've learned what I needed.

14:21.083 --> 14:22.916
The Torrezes have the code.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.875
Since it wasn't in the OSS,
it must be at their home.

14:25.958 --> 14:29.833
[Heck Knight] I will invade their home
and claim the code for you.

14:30.375 --> 14:31.250
No need.

14:32.375 --> 14:35.916
The Torrezes just won a copy of Hyskor.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.625
Tonight, I'll claim the code myself.

Wha… It's… It's a brand-new house.
Why are the floors squeaking?!

14:48.416 --> 14:51.791
[Torrez] We picked this place
for how it looks, not how it sounds.

14:51.875 --> 14:54.125
No way this is gonna work.

15:01.416 --> 15:04.166
How are we getting past
the squeaky wood floor?

15:04.250 --> 15:06.666
I tried mapping where all the squeaks are

15:06.750 --> 15:09.583
so that we can sneak past
Mom and Dad's office

15:09.666 --> 15:11.083
and get to the game room.

15:14.916 --> 15:17.750
But one creak and we're goners.

15:26.375 --> 15:28.625
-Wait for me!
-Sh!

15:28.708 --> 15:30.541
[Patty] One, two, three!

15:31.750 --> 15:33.041
I feel like a spy.

16:27.958 --> 16:29.583

-What now?
-I found this in his desk earlier.

16:37.750 --> 16:39.375
[Patty] You have no soul.

16:43.250 --> 16:45.583
Hyskor's downloading. Now we wait.

16:48.583 --> 16:51.291
We are dealing with
a highly intelligent enemy

16:51.375 --> 16:53.333
who knows about the Armageddon Code.

16:53.416 --> 16:55.291
It's time we consider deleting it.

16:55.375 --> 16:56.583
Out of the question.

16:56.666 --> 16:59.625
The code can break into any device
on the planet.

16:59.708 --> 17:01.625
Yes. Yes. He's right, babe.

17:01.708 --> 17:04.333
Think of the times we've used it
to save the world.

17:04.416 --> 17:05.791
This is our greatest tool.

17:05.875 --> 17:09.083
It's also the world's greatest threat.

17:09.166 --> 17:12.041
If there was the slightest chance
of someone taking it,

17:12.125 --> 17:14.375
we agreed we would erase it.

17:14.458 --> 17:18.791
Your orders are to protect the code
until we find a solution. No exceptions.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.041
What? He's right.

17:24.708 --> 17:26.333
Do not look at me like that.

17:27.750 --> 17:28.833
Or like that.

for the ultimate game experience.

opens up some kind of reverse access

18:17.625 --> 18:18.875
Good luck. He's a jerk.

18:18.958 --> 18:23.625
No. He's the most ruthless, scheming,
roguish rascal in the whole game.

18:23.708 --> 18:26.458
And no one plays him better than I do.

18:26.541 --> 18:28.416
Okay, we, uh… We…

-We move the code. We hide it.
-It's a threat no matter where we hide it.

18:32.708 --> 18:36.166
It's always been that way,
ever since you created it.

18:36.250 --> 18:38.958
-We need to delete it now, Terrence.
-No. N…

18:39.041 --> 18:42.750

26:07.291 --> 26:08.625
Patty, get to the safe house.

26:08.708 --> 26:11.333
There's something inside
I need you to protect.

26:12.791 --> 26:14.875
-[Patty] How do I find it?
-It'll find you.

26:14.958 --> 26:16.666
Just keep it safe till we get there.

26:19.625 --> 26:22.875
Wear this tracker
so that we can locate you. Syncing.

26:23.916 --> 26:24.958
Stay safe,

26:25.041 --> 26:27.000
and don't trust anybody.

26:27.083 --> 26:30.416
-We don't wanna go without you!
-[Torrez] You'll be safe. See you later.

26:30.500 --> 26:31.375
Babe!

26:33.500 --> 26:34.583
Mom!

26:35.166 --> 26:36.250
Dad!

26:36.916 --> 26:38.625
-No!
-[Terrence] Kids!

26:38.708 --> 26:39.875
-No!
-[Patty] Tony. Tony!

26:39.958 --> 26:42.166
No! Stay away from them!

26:43.916 --> 26:44.958
[bleeping]

26:47.875 --> 26:48.875
[Patty] Mom! Dad!

26:51.166 --> 26:52.458
No!

26:56.458 --> 26:57.541
[rasps]

27:00.791 --> 27:03.250
[Tony] You're a much better driver
than Dad.

27:03.333 --> 27:05.166
[Patty] I'm not driving!

27:05.250 --> 27:06.791
[Tony] Bad guys up ahead!

27:10.541 --> 27:12.041
They're chasing after us!

27:13.125 --> 27:16.666
-[Tony] Tell this thing to go faster!
-[Patty] Go faster!

27:18.041 --> 27:19.333
[tires screech]

27:23.166 --> 27:24.916
[Patty] They're up to something!

27:27.625 --> 27:29.416
They're hacking our autopilot.

27:32.125 --> 27:34.916
It's driving us
to where the bad guys want us to go.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
We gotta go manual
and get to the safe house ourselves.

27:44.208 --> 27:46.541
-Keep it on the road!
-Whoa, check this out.

27:55.125 --> 27:58.375
The anti-crash bounces us
right off obstacles.

28:00.333 --> 28:03.083
This thing controls
just like that game Mecha Wings.

28:03.166 --> 28:04.416
Give me that.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.666
I'm the best at Mecha Wings.

28:06.750 --> 28:08.625
[accelerating]

28:08.708 --> 28:10.541
[Tony] You're going too fast!

28:14.791 --> 28:16.500
Ah! Ah!

28:16.583 --> 28:17.958
[both scream]

28:18.041 --> 28:20.000
-[Tony] He's got us!
-Oh yeah?

28:25.375 --> 28:28.833
We gotta lose them,
or they'll follow us to the safe house.

28:34.916 --> 28:36.333
-Look out!
-[screams]

28:39.791 --> 28:41.208
How about some of this?

28:41.291 --> 28:42.791
[tires screech]

28:44.833 --> 28:46.500
You're going right into them!

28:47.000 --> 28:49.250
-That's the idea.
-What?!

28:49.875 --> 28:51.541
Just like Mecha Wings.

28:55.333 --> 28:56.250
[both] Whoo!

28:57.166 --> 28:58.000
Turn there.

28:59.333 --> 29:01.416
[Patty, mockingly] Na-na na-na na-na!

29:05.500 --> 29:08.291
[Patty] You're going the wrong way.

29:08.375 --> 29:11.041
That was kind of impressive, Patty.

29:11.125 --> 29:12.416
Thank you.

29:12.500 --> 29:16.375
Now let's just hope
this "safe house" is actually safe.

29:16.458 --> 29:18.166
[device beeping]

29:18.250 --> 29:19.333
Wait a second.

29:19.416 --> 29:21.375
I'm about to be really smart.

29:22.166 --> 29:23.750
I think Mom and Dad

29:24.333 --> 29:25.583
are spies.

29:25.666 --> 29:26.791
You think?

29:27.875 --> 29:29.875
[engine revs]

29:43.291 --> 29:44.833
We did something wrong.

29:46.250 --> 29:47.666
This can't be it.

29:48.791 --> 29:53.291
[Tony] So Mom and Dad are spies,
and they sent us to the middle of nowhere?

29:53.375 --> 29:56.416
-[Tony] This must be a joke.
-[Patty] Then why am I not laughing?

29:58.250 --> 30:01.458
[Patty] The water is so nice… and brown.

30:05.250 --> 30:06.833
[Tony] Maybe we jump in.

30:06.916 --> 30:08.125
[Patty] After you.

30:08.208 --> 30:10.250
[electronic voice] Your name?

30:10.333 --> 30:12.125
Uh, Patty Torrez.

30:12.208 --> 30:13.375
Tony Torrez.

30:13.458 --> 30:14.958
Your full name, please.

30:15.041 --> 30:17.916
Uh, Patty Tango-Torrez?

30:18.500 --> 30:21.541
My dad's last name is Tango,
and my mom's is Torrez.

30:22.125 --> 30:24.625
-Your full name.
-We never use our full names.

30:24.708 --> 30:25.791
They're too long.

30:25.875 --> 30:27.458
Your full name, please.

30:28.500 --> 30:33.041
Patricia Angelita Sorrow
Feliz Rhiannon Tango-Torrez.

30:33.125 --> 30:37.458
Antonio Joaquin Cecilio
Rogue Amadeus Tango-Torrez.

30:37.541 --> 30:40.375
-[bleeping]
-[Patty] The safe house is underwater?

30:40.458 --> 30:42.250
[Tony] Either that or it drowned.

30:44.791 --> 30:46.500
-[clunking]
-[elevator dings]

30:50.625 --> 30:51.791
Yoo-hoo!

30:53.708 --> 30:55.041
It's empty.

30:57.750 --> 30:59.458
[Tony] This place is a dump.

31:03.541 --> 31:04.458
[high-pitched hum]

31:04.541 --> 31:06.125
-[both gasp]
-Hey, kiddos.

31:06.208 --> 31:09.791
We couldn't wait to show you
the safe house when you were old enough.

31:10.291 --> 31:13.666
If you're here now and by yourselves,

31:14.208 --> 31:16.625
that means
something has gone terribly wrong.

31:18.208 --> 31:21.375
But don't you worry.
Mom and Dad are very close.

31:21.458 --> 31:23.375
And if you haven't guessed yet,

31:24.125 --> 31:26.916
your father and I are spies.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.041
[clunking]

31:29.875 --> 31:31.250
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

31:32.458 --> 31:35.666
Hopefully, we will see you soon
so we can explain everything.

31:35.750 --> 31:36.916
In the meantime,

31:38.833 --> 31:40.333
choose your activity.

31:40.416 --> 31:42.208
There's comfort for sleep…

31:43.333 --> 31:46.541
[both] Whoa!

31:46.625 --> 31:49.750
-Cozy beds!
-I get the top bunk.

31:51.083 --> 31:52.583
…food for nourishment…

31:55.041 --> 31:57.500
A little kitchen and snacks.

31:58.583 --> 32:01.291
…gadget tutorials for a competitive edge…

32:02.166 --> 32:04.750
[both] Whoa!

32:04.833 --> 32:07.000
[Patty] Spy gadgets!

32:07.083 --> 32:10.083
This place is amazing!

32:10.166 --> 32:13.166
…and spy training modules
for self-defense.

32:13.666 --> 32:15.375
-[Terrence] Stand here.
-Spy training!

32:17.583 --> 32:19.708
-I'm gonna be the best spy ever.
-[beep]

32:19.791 --> 32:21.250
-[clunking]
-[Tony] Ah!

32:22.208 --> 32:23.208
Tony!

32:24.750 --> 32:25.666
Hello.

32:26.333 --> 32:29.750
-Move over. I'm coming down.
-[Terrence] Lesson one complete.

32:29.833 --> 32:31.500
Always look out for traps.

32:32.166 --> 32:33.541
[Tony] Look at this place.

32:33.625 --> 32:35.708
[Terrence] Lesson two, ambush.

32:35.791 --> 32:37.208
"Ambush Alley."

32:38.791 --> 32:39.750
This is easy.

32:41.666 --> 32:43.250
Just like a video game.

32:48.375 --> 32:49.625
Hee-hee. You did it!

32:50.541 --> 32:51.541
[Tony] Ah!

32:52.708 --> 32:53.666
Oh.

32:53.750 --> 32:55.541
[Terrence] Almost good.

32:55.625 --> 32:56.833
[chuckles]

32:56.916 --> 32:59.000
I'm gonna try this one.

32:59.083 --> 33:01.708
Avoid the lasers or you'll trip the alarm.

33:03.291 --> 33:05.041
Okay. Your turn.

33:05.125 --> 33:06.208
[beeping, whirring]

33:06.291 --> 33:07.125
-[grunts]
-Failure!

33:07.208 --> 33:08.166
[chuckles]

33:08.250 --> 33:09.291
Please try again.

33:10.458 --> 33:12.000
-[beeping]
-[Tony] Oof!

33:12.083 --> 33:12.916
Failure.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.666
How come when you mess up, I get hit?

33:16.250 --> 33:18.041
Um… because we're a team?

33:18.125 --> 33:19.458
Let me try.

33:26.583 --> 33:27.458
Failure.

33:27.541 --> 33:29.375
Smart training system.

33:29.958 --> 33:32.583
-Let's go upstairs and do gadgets.
-Okay.

33:34.875 --> 33:36.875
[tense music playing]

33:42.500 --> 33:44.041
[dramatic music playing]

33:47.458 --> 33:49.375
[rattling]

34:02.625 --> 34:04.833
-Let's find a way out.
-[groans]

34:04.916 --> 34:06.958
Oh, did they hurt you, my love?

34:07.041 --> 34:09.208
No. No, no, no. They didn't.

34:09.291 --> 34:12.250
The sleeper kiss is
what leaves the lingering pain.

34:12.333 --> 34:13.750
I had to delete it.

34:13.833 --> 34:16.375
-I know.
-Okay. Then let's break outta here.

34:17.666 --> 34:18.583
Ah, oh.

34:18.666 --> 34:19.916
-[clunking]
-Oh.

34:20.791 --> 34:23.583
-Oh.
-I'm gonna say that's a trap.

34:23.666 --> 34:26.500
At least we get to meet
whoever's behind this. Come on.

34:26.583 --> 34:28.333
-So you're just gonna--
-Come on!

34:28.916 --> 34:32.125
I'm sure they're gonna let us
waltz right into where they are.

34:34.708 --> 34:36.166
This is why we get in trouble.

34:36.250 --> 34:38.083
-You're impulsive.
-Just stay close.

34:38.166 --> 34:40.541
I am just asking you
to use a little caution.

34:40.625 --> 34:41.708
Stay close.

34:42.708 --> 34:43.916
[Terrence] Come on.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.375
-[Nora] Hear that?
-Yeah.

34:47.458 --> 34:48.458
One, two, three.

34:53.291 --> 34:54.208
Whoa.

34:55.666 --> 34:57.166
-That's ominous.
-Yeah.

34:58.541 --> 35:01.000
-[Terrence] Very interesting.
-[Torrez] Uh-huh.

35:03.208 --> 35:05.208
[bricks scraping]

35:05.875 --> 35:06.791
[Torrez] Oh.

35:07.875 --> 35:08.750
Hi.

35:09.333 --> 35:11.125
Uh, excuse our appearance.

35:11.208 --> 35:13.708
We didn't realize
it was Fantasy Friday here.

35:14.416 --> 35:19.000
[Terrence] Nice architecture, by the way.
Very, uh… retro video gamey.

35:19.083 --> 35:21.083
[laughs]

35:23.166 --> 35:25.166
As far as I'm concerned,

35:25.250 --> 35:28.833
the late 20th century was the height

35:30.750 --> 35:33.250
of visual technology.

35:36.416 --> 35:38.250
It was all downhill from there.

35:40.500 --> 35:41.500
Please sit down.

35:41.583 --> 35:42.916
Oh, there…

35:48.375 --> 35:49.333
Oh.

35:50.166 --> 35:51.000
Trust me.

35:51.083 --> 35:53.083
[suspenseful music playing]

36:02.000 --> 36:02.833
Oh.

36:05.250 --> 36:07.333
So, Rey Kingston,

36:07.416 --> 36:11.250
one of the most powerful tech giants
in all of history,

36:11.958 --> 36:16.291
using a virus to force everyone
to play video games. Why?

36:16.375 --> 36:18.958
Well, the only true benefit
in gaining power

36:19.041 --> 36:20.458
is to influence the world.

36:20.541 --> 36:24.000
There's no better way to do that
than through your Armageddon Code.

36:24.083 --> 36:27.166
And you shut off
half the world with it. Happy?

36:28.041 --> 36:29.833
No, I'm not.

36:31.125 --> 36:33.333
Yeah, Armageddon
was supposed to allow Hyskor

36:33.416 --> 36:37.000
to break into every device on the planet.

36:37.791 --> 36:41.791
So why has it stopped halfway?

36:43.208 --> 36:45.708
-Try turning it off and back on?
-That works.

36:45.791 --> 36:47.458
[Torrez] Maybe just give it a smack.

36:48.416 --> 36:50.625
Take it out… [blows] …right back in.

36:52.125 --> 36:56.000
-You're not gonna help me fix it, are you?
-Not a chance.

36:57.291 --> 36:58.208
Ah…

36:58.833 --> 37:00.208
There's other ways.

37:01.375 --> 37:02.708
For the longest time,

37:02.791 --> 37:06.833
I've wanted to challenge both of you
to a duel.

37:07.958 --> 37:10.833
-Why us?
-I mean, are we that good?

37:10.916 --> 37:11.833
No.

37:13.208 --> 37:14.750
You're not good at all.

37:17.625 --> 37:20.208
If you win, you go free.

37:21.041 --> 37:21.916
[blades swoosh]

37:23.208 --> 37:25.041
If I win, you fix the code.

37:27.791 --> 37:28.791
Let's do this.

37:34.083 --> 37:35.708
[lively music playing]

37:48.500 --> 37:49.750
[Terrence grunts]

37:50.208 --> 37:52.083
[Torrez] Ah, ah… Ooh.

37:52.625 --> 37:53.541
Oh.

38:14.208 --> 38:15.250
Sorry.

38:18.041 --> 38:19.000
Babe!

38:19.833 --> 38:20.791
Ha-ha-ha.

38:20.875 --> 38:22.083
[grunting]

38:22.791 --> 38:25.541
The code I stole was complete.

38:28.541 --> 38:31.583
You must have split it
the moment I took it from your home.

38:31.666 --> 38:32.875
Babe!

38:32.958 --> 38:38.208
Failsafe mechanism, huh? To ensure
it doesn't fall into the wrong hands?

38:42.250 --> 38:45.208
Wear this tracker
so that we can locate you.

38:45.833 --> 38:47.833
So if her necklace is a tracker…

38:50.125 --> 38:53.125
Your kids have
the missing piece, don't they?

38:54.125 --> 38:55.375
Stay away from my kids!

39:05.583 --> 39:07.208
-Careful!
-[Torrez panting]

39:07.708 --> 39:09.458
Is this all just a game to you?

39:10.833 --> 39:11.666
It is.

39:18.166 --> 39:20.708
And with game theory,
anything can be fixed,

39:20.791 --> 39:23.333
even this sorry world.

39:30.291 --> 39:33.541
Maybe your children will be
a little more helpful than you.

39:35.958 --> 39:36.958
Let's find out.

39:45.958 --> 39:47.916
[Patty] I get the top bunk now.

39:52.416 --> 39:54.041
Spy fashion!

39:55.166 --> 39:56.541
-[whirring]
-[gasps]

39:56.625 --> 39:59.291
[Patty] We have all the time in the world!

39:59.375 --> 40:02.583
Patty! It's a spy-suit generator.

40:03.375 --> 40:04.250
[Patty] Whoa!

40:04.333 --> 40:05.875
[Tony] I'm gonna try it.

40:05.958 --> 40:08.791
[Patty] Maybe we should read
the instructions first.

40:08.875 --> 40:09.875
Tony!

40:11.208 --> 40:13.708
Oh no. You're a pancake.

40:16.791 --> 40:18.791
[triumphant music playing]

40:25.416 --> 40:26.500
Let me try!

[grunts]

40:55.833 --> 40:57.375
Failure. Try again.

41:05.791 --> 41:08.958
Super goop.

41:09.041 --> 41:10.375
Sticks to anything

41:11.125 --> 41:12.375
once activated.

41:13.750 --> 41:15.291
[Tony] What is that thing?

41:15.791 --> 41:17.916
It says it's a "thought bubble."

41:18.583 --> 41:20.333
Looks like you select an emotion

41:20.416 --> 41:26.208
and, boom, your enemy
is either laughing, crying, hungry…

41:27.375 --> 41:29.291
"Cute overload"?

41:29.375 --> 41:30.875
[Tony] Gadgets are weird.

41:50.458 --> 41:51.375
Ambush.

41:52.500 --> 41:53.791
Almost good.

41:54.291 --> 41:56.291
[whimsical music playing]

42:01.125 --> 42:03.666
Wait a minute.
I just remembered something.

42:04.166 --> 42:08.083
Mom told me that there was
something very important here,

42:08.166 --> 42:10.083
but that it would find me.

42:13.416 --> 42:16.875
Aw! Look at you!

42:16.958 --> 42:18.416
[crab chitters]

42:20.416 --> 42:22.916
You're my favorite thing in the world now.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.958
I'm gonna call you

42:25.541 --> 42:26.458
Bronson.

42:29.416 --> 42:30.500
[giggles]

42:32.708 --> 42:36.333
How To Be A Spy, author unknown.

42:37.375 --> 42:41.083
"A good spy is a master of deception"?

42:41.583 --> 42:44.250
"All spying is based on lies"?

42:44.333 --> 42:45.333
Really?

42:46.791 --> 42:48.250
This book is awesome.

42:48.333 --> 42:51.291
Mom and Dad's job
is to lie and break the rules.

42:51.375 --> 42:53.291
I don't care if it's their job.

42:53.375 --> 42:56.000
They tell us to be honest,
but they weren't with us.

42:56.083 --> 42:59.000
It proves that telling the truth
only gets you in trouble.

42:59.083 --> 43:02.791
That's crazy. Telling the truth
should never be a bad thing.

43:02.875 --> 43:04.500
Oh yeah? Look here.

43:05.125 --> 43:07.500
"A good spy never tells the truth."

43:10.708 --> 43:12.375
I'll never be a spy then.

43:13.375 --> 43:14.708
Have fun with that.

43:15.208 --> 43:17.250
I wish Mom and Dad were here now.

43:17.333 --> 43:18.416
Well, they're not.

43:18.500 --> 43:20.583
They're out spying.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.083
-Tony, what if this was all our fault?
-How?

43:29.166 --> 43:31.541
You downloaded Hyskor last night,

43:31.625 --> 43:34.958
and then it was all over the news,
taking over the world.

43:35.041 --> 43:36.625
I guess that makes sense.

43:36.708 --> 43:40.000
Since we caused this game apocalypse,
then we should fix it.

43:40.083 --> 43:43.250
You mean take down the final boss?
Like Rat Thickskull?

43:43.333 --> 43:45.541
No, I'm saying that we save Mom and Dad

43:45.625 --> 43:48.750
so that they can stop the bad guys
and save the world.

43:48.833 --> 43:51.458
That's the craziest idea I've ever heard.

43:52.708 --> 43:54.583
So let's do it.

-[dramatic music crescendoes]

[woman] Children!

44:05.041 --> 44:08.000
We're your parents' coworkers.

44:08.083 --> 44:09.708
Mom said not to trust anyone.

44:09.791 --> 44:12.875
-I say take 'em down.
-What if they really are secret agents?

44:12.958 --> 44:14.666
We can apologize later.

44:14.750 --> 44:15.583
Children?

44:16.125 --> 44:18.250
You're our parents' coworkers?

44:18.333 --> 44:20.041
-So you're spies?
-Yes.

44:20.125 --> 44:22.250
We are here to protect you.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.625
Well, according to your manual,
a good spy never tells the truth.

44:27.708 --> 44:29.708
So we don't trust you.

44:30.958 --> 44:33.875
We gotta go right now.
You're not safe here.

44:35.416 --> 44:36.791
But it's a safe house.

44:38.208 --> 44:39.041
That's it.

44:47.291 --> 44:48.291
Careful.

44:48.958 --> 44:50.750
They might have gadgets.

44:50.833 --> 44:52.000
Here they come.

44:56.125 --> 44:58.125
They could use some serious training.

44:59.125 --> 44:59.958
Yup.

45:01.250 --> 45:02.375
Spy training.

45:02.458 --> 45:04.583
-[Terrence] Stand here.
-Ah!

Trap door! Failure.

[agent yells]

45:13.291 --> 45:16.041
Avoid the lasers or you'll trip the alarm.

45:16.541 --> 45:17.500
Failure.

45:18.166 --> 45:20.333
Sorry. Try again.

45:23.750 --> 45:26.958
[gasps] Thanks, Bronson.
Now find us another exit.

45:37.458 --> 45:38.958
[Tony] Watch your step.

45:39.041 --> 45:39.916
[agent] Oh!

45:40.000 --> 45:41.208
Try harder.

45:42.166 --> 45:44.750
[Patty] You two look… hungry.

45:45.500 --> 45:47.500
[device emits high-pitched whine]

45:57.583 --> 45:58.750
[Patty] Thanks, Bronson.

45:58.833 --> 46:01.750
Now let's get out of here
before they eat the whole safe house.

46:01.833 --> 46:03.458
-[Patty] Mine.
-[Tony] Boop.

46:04.625 --> 46:07.291
[Patty] Come on, Bronson!
You're part of the team.

46:16.041 --> 46:17.041
[Patty] Too easy.

46:18.291 --> 46:19.208
Yes!

46:20.250 --> 46:21.833
[man] Nice try, kids.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.375
I'm Devlin, OSS division.

46:26.291 --> 46:27.750
Your parents work for me.

46:27.833 --> 46:29.208
We don't believe you.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.250
Trust me.

46:32.333 --> 46:33.416
Oops.

46:37.625 --> 46:39.958
-You're coming with us.
-[Tony] Huh? Oh.

46:40.458 --> 46:41.583
We didn't know.

46:41.666 --> 46:45.250
[Tony] He has two pairs of sunglasses.
He's definitely a spy.

46:46.083 --> 46:48.041
Hey! Watch the gadgets.

46:57.958 --> 47:00.333
[Tony] There are no video games
in this truck.

47:00.416 --> 47:04.791
[Patty] Oh, look, in case anyone
ever wonders where all the spies are.

47:05.333 --> 47:09.291
[Devlin] Everything is a mess.
Half the world got hit by a game virus.

47:09.375 --> 47:11.875
Some things are working. Some aren't.

47:11.958 --> 47:13.916
Yeah, we noticed.

47:15.583 --> 47:17.916
Cool spy boat.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.625
That's actually a plane

47:19.708 --> 47:21.666
that's also a boat.

47:22.291 --> 47:23.416
It's complicated, kid.

47:23.500 --> 47:26.458
It's one of our only vehicles
that hasn't been locked down.

47:26.541 --> 47:29.083
An OSS Super Ducky.

47:29.166 --> 47:30.666
Why is it so small?

47:30.750 --> 47:33.166
Fits one adult. It's called secrecy.

47:33.666 --> 47:37.166
And secrecy is how we protect the world
from our enemies.

47:37.250 --> 47:38.666
Now, come on. We're in a hurry.

47:38.750 --> 47:41.208
[Patty] Well, maybe we wouldn't have
so many enemies

47:41.291 --> 47:43.833
if we weren't spying all the time.

47:44.583 --> 47:46.000
[Devlin] Nice dream, kid.

47:46.583 --> 47:49.708
Our entire system's been locked up
for the past 12 hours.

47:49.791 --> 47:51.458
We can't access anything at all.

47:51.541 --> 47:53.041
How do we find our parents?

47:53.125 --> 47:55.875
You got your vehicle working
and escaped your house,

47:55.958 --> 47:58.625
so we think
you two have what it takes to help.

47:58.708 --> 48:00.958
You want us to be real spies?

48:01.041 --> 48:02.291
Don't get carried away.

48:02.375 --> 48:06.208
I just want you to beat this video game
so we can access our systems.

48:06.291 --> 48:10.083
Take off the kids' cuffs so they can do
what they do best. Play games.

48:10.666 --> 48:13.750
-But they're dangerous, sir.
-Just… Off, please.

48:13.833 --> 48:17.208
-I told you games would come in handy.
-Okay. Get in there, kid.

48:19.583 --> 48:20.625
[Devlin] Oh, wow.

48:21.500 --> 48:24.916
We could never get past that part.
Wow. That is great, kid.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.208
That is… That's great.

48:27.291 --> 48:28.708
I'll take over from here.

48:28.791 --> 48:30.166
Um…

48:30.791 --> 48:32.875
-I wouldn't do that.
-Me neither.

48:32.958 --> 48:35.416
I've played a few video games in my day.

48:35.500 --> 48:38.000
You ever heard of GoldenEye? Watch this.

48:39.583 --> 48:41.083
-[thud]
-[character screams]

48:41.583 --> 48:43.291
-[Devlin] Hmm.
-[kids] Mm-hmm.

48:43.375 --> 48:44.583
All right, just, uh…

48:45.708 --> 48:46.541
get it done.

48:52.416 --> 48:55.583
The system's back online.
Yeah, that's good work, kid.

48:55.666 --> 48:58.083
All right. Now we can
start searching for leads.

48:58.166 --> 49:00.875
Let's go, people. I wanna see some names.

49:00.958 --> 49:04.083
Mom told me there was
something hidden at the safe house.

49:05.250 --> 49:08.958
-Do you have something important, Bronson?
-[Bronson chitters]

49:19.333 --> 49:21.166
[Devlin] The Armageddon Code.

49:21.250 --> 49:22.666
But only a piece of it?

49:24.833 --> 49:27.583
Oh. Your parents were smart
to split the code.

49:28.208 --> 49:30.208
This gives us a fighting chance.

49:30.291 --> 49:33.083
What happens
if the bad guy gets both pieces?

49:33.166 --> 49:35.375
Your parents are
only authorized to use that piece.

49:35.458 --> 49:37.083
If the enemy combines them,

49:37.166 --> 49:40.625
he'd infect every device in the world
with his game virus.

49:40.708 --> 49:42.291
He'd be king of the planet.

49:44.958 --> 49:46.000
The King.

49:47.666 --> 49:50.583
Devlin, we might know who your bad guy is.

49:52.250 --> 49:53.125
Who?

49:53.625 --> 49:55.625
[menacing music playing]

50:03.708 --> 50:05.625
[agent] Unauthorized access. Oh!

50:10.333 --> 50:12.208
-[computer beeping]
-Here it is.

50:12.291 --> 50:16.166
[Tony] Rey Kingston.
But everyone knows him as the King.

50:16.250 --> 50:19.750
Someone broke into our parents' system
and stole Armageddon.

50:19.833 --> 50:22.583
It could only have been the King.

50:22.666 --> 50:25.000
His new game, Hyskor,
is what you're seeing

50:25.083 --> 50:27.291
on every device across the world.

50:28.083 --> 50:31.208
The FBI already raided
his game studio this morning,

50:31.291 --> 50:34.333
but it was empty,
and this King was nowhere to be found.

50:34.416 --> 50:40.041
Well, in his games, he always hides
the bad guy in a cool, secret lair.

50:42.291 --> 50:45.000
People, how do we find him?
I want suggestions.

50:45.083 --> 50:49.375
Well, my mom gave me this to track us.

50:49.458 --> 50:53.625
So maybe we reverse-track her tracker?

51:03.500 --> 51:04.666
[beeping]

51:04.750 --> 51:07.000
That must be
where your parents are located.

51:07.083 --> 51:08.833
And quite possibly

51:09.458 --> 51:10.375
the King.

-It means the bad guys are gonna break in.

51:20.375 --> 51:23.625
From there, there, and there.

51:23.708 --> 51:24.708
-What?
-Trust me.

51:24.791 --> 51:28.583
-We've learned from experience.
-Know how much money I pay for security?

51:28.666 --> 51:29.958
There's one!

51:30.041 --> 51:31.666
[frantic yelling]

51:33.791 --> 51:35.500
[Devlin] Get Armageddon out of here!

51:37.916 --> 51:39.000
Protect the code!

51:45.458 --> 51:48.791
Mom told us that we have to keep this safe
until she finds us.

[character grunts]

51:57.541 --> 51:58.375
Go!

52:05.791 --> 52:09.250
-Whoa! Did you see that?
-See what happens if you kick 'em.

52:12.916 --> 52:14.000
[groaning]

52:14.750 --> 52:16.041
It did it again.

52:16.625 --> 52:17.833
[Devlin] Give me that!

52:17.916 --> 52:19.875
Let the grown-ups handle this.

52:24.833 --> 52:26.666
[Heck Knight] Give me the code.

52:26.750 --> 52:27.833
[Devlin] Whoa!

52:35.541 --> 52:37.250
[Patty] They're getting away!

52:38.041 --> 52:42.666
-We need to find out where they're going.
-Bronson, we need eyes on the Heck Knight.

52:46.375 --> 52:48.750
Devlin! Get up and go chase them!

52:48.833 --> 52:49.750
You…

52:50.708 --> 52:52.750
-[clattering]
-[Patty] Ugh.

52:52.833 --> 52:55.750
The bad guys are escaping on the lake.

52:55.833 --> 52:57.500
We'll never catch them.

53:03.416 --> 53:05.000
[Tony] You can do the driving.

53:05.708 --> 53:09.458
But only OSS agents know
how to drive this.

53:11.916 --> 53:13.791
-[engine revs]
-Thanks, Bronson!

53:15.708 --> 53:17.750
[Tony] I just remembered I get seasick.

53:19.250 --> 53:21.250
[dramatic music playing]

53:36.583 --> 53:38.000
They're getting away!

53:38.500 --> 53:39.916
Our boat can't swim.

53:41.708 --> 53:44.916
Yeah, well, their boats can't fly.

53:45.541 --> 53:47.791
Bronson, airborne mode.

53:57.583 --> 54:00.750
[Patty] Bronson, here's the location
we got from the necklace.

54:00.833 --> 54:01.833
Fly us there.

54:02.541 --> 54:05.416
[Tony] Then we can get the code
and save Mom and Dad.

54:12.375 --> 54:14.500
Why are you still reading that book?

54:14.583 --> 54:16.625
These are the cheat codes to life.

54:16.708 --> 54:19.875
You shouldn't cheat the King.
It'll backfire on you.

54:20.583 --> 54:22.541
Be smart and play fair.

54:22.625 --> 54:24.833
-Doesn't work.
-How can you say that?

54:24.916 --> 54:29.375
Remember when we snuck into Dad's office
and found that puzzle he was working on?

54:29.458 --> 54:32.250
Uh-huh. The one
that was really tricky to finish.

54:32.333 --> 54:34.916
When I solved it for him,
I thought he'd be happy,

54:35.000 --> 54:38.541
but he got mad at me for sneaking
into his work, saying I was dishonest.

54:38.625 --> 54:42.541
Yeah. Then he put up
the tech restrictions on all our stuff.

54:42.625 --> 54:45.791
See? Telling the truth
only got me in trouble.

54:48.041 --> 54:49.500
Maybe at first.

54:49.583 --> 54:53.000
But in the end, honesty always wins.

54:53.875 --> 54:55.458
[alarm blaring]

54:55.541 --> 54:57.083
King's lair up ahead!

54:58.208 --> 55:01.250
-We're not slowing down.
-Bronson, what's wrong?

55:02.958 --> 55:05.000
We're gonna crash into that wall!

55:19.833 --> 55:21.750
[mysterious music playing]

55:21.833 --> 55:24.083
-That wall isn't really there.
-Oh.

55:24.583 --> 55:26.416
Polygon-based architecture.

55:28.708 --> 55:30.666
Just like in old video games.

55:31.916 --> 55:33.875
This guy is living the dream.

55:37.791 --> 55:39.958
[beeping, whirring]

55:40.500 --> 55:41.791
[Tony] No way.

55:42.583 --> 55:46.458
This whole place is
covered in some sort of AR overlay.

55:46.541 --> 55:48.375
AR? That hologram stuff

55:48.458 --> 55:51.083
that makes things look different
than they are?

55:51.166 --> 55:52.750
Yeah, that stuff.

55:52.833 --> 55:55.583
Maybe these glasses
can help us find Mom and Dad.

55:58.875 --> 56:01.250
[breathes heavily, grunts]

56:05.875 --> 56:06.916
Don't take a nap.

56:07.000 --> 56:10.625
We have to keep trying or stop the code
so we can get back to the kids.

56:10.708 --> 56:13.416
Even if we can escape,
I don't think I can stop this.

56:14.208 --> 56:16.958
But you made the code.
Can't you unmake it?

56:17.041 --> 56:18.791
Yes and no.

56:20.083 --> 56:21.583
Operation Fireball?

56:21.666 --> 56:24.166
Of course.
We had to take down that villain Vargos.

56:24.250 --> 56:27.250
We were supposed to destroy his lair
and everything in it,

56:27.333 --> 56:29.916
but I found plans for this weapon.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.791
Plans for the Armageddon Code?

56:32.875 --> 56:35.500
I… I brought the plans back home

56:35.583 --> 56:38.291
so I could finish
building the code, but I…

56:39.666 --> 56:41.750
I couldn't figure it out. I failed.

56:42.250 --> 56:45.166
-[Torrez] How did you finish it?
-[Terrence] I didn't.

56:47.791 --> 56:48.791
Tony did.

56:49.416 --> 56:52.208
He doesn't even really know it,
but he did.

56:53.166 --> 56:56.083
-How is that possible?
-He got into my work somehow.

56:56.166 --> 56:58.125
He knew the plans better than I did.

56:58.208 --> 57:00.958
He finished what I started,
and I built Armageddon

57:01.041 --> 57:02.750
on top of what he gave me.

57:03.500 --> 57:05.958
I could've told him everything,
but I scolded him

57:06.041 --> 57:08.500
and put tech restrictions up
to protect the code.

57:08.583 --> 57:10.541
The kids don't even know that's why

57:10.625 --> 57:13.208
everything they love
is being kept from them.

57:13.291 --> 57:14.958
And this is all my fault.

57:19.083 --> 57:21.625
That is quite a story.

57:25.541 --> 57:28.791
I knew you were hiding something from me.

57:29.333 --> 57:32.166
But it doesn't matter who made what.

57:32.250 --> 57:34.833
I've taken the missing piece
from your children,

57:34.916 --> 57:39.208
and within minutes,
the code will be ready to fire. [laughs]

57:46.291 --> 57:48.000
[zapping]

57:55.541 --> 57:56.791
Your kids failed you.

57:58.791 --> 58:00.375
Or maybe you failed them.

58:03.625 --> 58:05.375
[The King chuckles]

58:07.125 --> 58:09.500
So Tony made the code.

58:11.625 --> 58:13.791
Now no one in the world can stop me.

58:14.791 --> 58:16.291
[chuckles]

58:16.375 --> 58:18.541
Tony! Tony made it!

58:18.625 --> 58:20.666
[laughs]

58:20.750 --> 58:22.750
[suspenseful music playing]

58:30.583 --> 58:32.875
There's a computer behind this panel.

58:34.291 --> 58:35.875
Bronson, we need your help.

58:46.458 --> 58:49.291
Now we can download a map of this place.

58:52.708 --> 58:55.958
Look. The prison cells
are right by the King's VR pods

58:56.041 --> 58:58.041
he showed on that video at school.

58:59.208 --> 59:00.458
I hear footsteps.

59:21.125 --> 59:24.583
-[Tony] Just don't look down.
-[Patty] I might've already looked down.

59:24.666 --> 59:27.833
[The King] Armageddon is close
to being combined.

59:28.625 --> 59:30.875
Then it will be unstoppable.

59:31.666 --> 59:36.250
The King is already combining the code.
We have to find Mom and Dad now.

59:44.166 --> 59:45.083
Oh.

59:45.166 --> 59:48.583
Those Hyskor characters
are just AR overlays too.

59:49.583 --> 59:51.208
They're actually robots.

59:53.125 --> 59:54.125
Aw.

59:54.208 --> 59:56.166
Those robots aren't so scary.

01:00:03.375 --> 01:00:04.625
[screams] Ah!

01:00:06.458 --> 01:00:08.958
-We need to jump.
-What? Are you crazy?

01:00:09.583 --> 01:00:11.791
-[Tony] We need to jump.
-No!

01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:12.958
[both yell]

01:00:13.541 --> 01:00:15.541
[robots whir and clunk]

01:00:25.541 --> 01:00:27.541
[beeping, whirring]

01:00:29.541 --> 01:00:31.541
[Tony] Those things are totally scary.

01:00:31.625 --> 01:00:33.583
[Patty] This way to the prison cells.

01:00:34.333 --> 01:00:35.416
[Torrez sighs]

01:00:36.708 --> 01:00:39.333
[sweeping orchestral music playing]

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:42.375
-[Torrez] Is that…
-[Terrence] Our kids.

01:00:42.458 --> 01:00:44.833
-[Terrence] Patty!
-[Patty] Mom! Dad!

01:00:44.916 --> 01:00:46.375
Oh, my babies!

01:00:46.458 --> 01:00:47.875
Are you safe?

01:00:47.958 --> 01:00:48.958
Stand back.

01:00:49.583 --> 01:00:52.791
I'm setting my Magna Boots
from pull to push.

01:00:55.416 --> 01:00:57.041
-[Torrez] Oh!
-[Terrence] Well done!

01:00:57.125 --> 01:01:00.083
-[Terrence] Well done!
-[Torrez] That's my girl. Oh!

01:01:03.416 --> 01:01:04.583
Wow.

01:01:04.666 --> 01:01:09.291
I can't believe you found us.
How… How did you even get here?

01:01:09.375 --> 01:01:14.125
Aw. Bronson flew us in the Super Ducky
that we jacked from the OSS.

01:01:16.416 --> 01:01:17.875
-I am so proud…
-That is…

01:01:17.958 --> 01:01:20.375
-…in this moment
-…just beyond, my sweets.

01:01:20.458 --> 01:01:24.041
[Heck Knight] Armageddon is combined.
Launching in six minutes.

01:01:24.125 --> 01:01:26.333
What now, master spies?
The clock's ticking.

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:30.541
Actually, I have a really solid plan
inspired by our greatest mission.

01:01:30.625 --> 01:01:32.958
-Operation Fireball.
-You got it.

01:01:33.041 --> 01:01:36.625
What was this Operation Fireball exactly?

01:01:39.333 --> 01:01:44.500
Our mission was to infiltrate
the operation of an evil man named Vargos.

01:01:44.583 --> 01:01:47.541
[Terrence] And we were able
to infiltrate his lair by

01:01:47.625 --> 01:01:48.833
knocking on the door.

01:01:48.916 --> 01:01:50.666
You just knocked on his door?

01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:52.750
-With a truck.
-Big truck.

01:01:52.833 --> 01:01:53.833
[Torrez] Mm-hmm.

01:01:56.416 --> 01:01:59.125
We used our gadgets
to get past the guards.

01:01:59.208 --> 01:02:00.708
[lively spy music playing]

01:02:00.791 --> 01:02:01.708
[whirring]

01:02:04.541 --> 01:02:06.041
Friendly gadgets?

01:02:06.125 --> 01:02:08.041
Uh…

01:02:10.208 --> 01:02:11.583
Well… [mumbles]

01:02:11.666 --> 01:02:15.333
I went to stop the superweapon
while your mother negotiated with Vargos.

01:02:15.416 --> 01:02:16.250
Mm-hmm.

01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:19.333
"Negotiate"?
You mean "beat up," don't you?

01:02:19.416 --> 01:02:20.750
[grunting]

01:02:22.875 --> 01:02:25.500
That sums it up.
I couldn't stop the bomb in time.

01:02:25.583 --> 01:02:27.666
I had to stall just long enough…

01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:30.791
So that we can
set our own bomb off instead.

01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:34.833
We wiped out Vargos's operation
in one glorious…

01:02:34.916 --> 01:02:36.166
[both] Fireball.

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:37.500
-Pew!
-Pff!

01:02:39.875 --> 01:02:41.208
-I love you.
-I love you more.

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:42.458
Awesome.

01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:46.833
Not awesome!
You could've found a better way.

01:02:47.416 --> 01:02:49.833
I'd… Hmm? How?

01:02:49.916 --> 01:02:53.250
You could've asked nicely
to see Mr. Vargos.

01:02:54.041 --> 01:02:58.625
You could've used a thought bubble
to keep the guards entertained.

01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:00.416
[fun jingle playing]

01:03:03.333 --> 01:03:08.333
You could've gotten an understanding
of his interior-design sense.

01:03:08.416 --> 01:03:12.375
You could've intervened in his plan
with a softer touch.

01:03:13.541 --> 01:03:15.583
I guess we… could've considered that.

01:03:15.666 --> 01:03:19.375
So that maybe
instead of Operation Fireball,

01:03:19.458 --> 01:03:22.500
it could be Operation Peace and Harmony.

01:03:22.583 --> 01:03:24.583
[sweeping string music playing]

01:03:27.125 --> 01:03:29.958
-That's my child.
-Yeah. Yeah. Certainly not mine.

01:03:30.041 --> 01:03:34.083
-[Heck Knight] Armageddon in four minutes.
-We have four minutes left.

01:03:34.166 --> 01:03:37.666
I could come up with a fantastic plan
if I had a map of this place.

01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:39.791
-Boop.
-[gasps] Yes! Well done.

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:43.250
We have to get to these computer terminals
to stall for time.

01:03:43.333 --> 01:03:44.166
Let's go.

01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:45.916
-[Tony] That's the whole plan?
-Yup.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.708
We're gonna buy some time
to send a signal to OSS for help.

01:03:48.791 --> 01:03:52.291
-We stall when we can beat the King?
-Armageddon is being armed.

01:03:52.375 --> 01:03:55.666
Nothing we can do now except slow down
its final process. Let's split up.

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:58.583
-I'll take Tony. You take Patty.
-They have Magna Boots.

01:03:58.666 --> 01:04:01.541
-They can access the branching path.
-No, no, no, no.

01:04:01.625 --> 01:04:03.833
-It's too dangerous for them.
-You're right.

01:04:03.916 --> 01:04:05.208
Come here a second.

01:04:07.166 --> 01:04:08.375
We can do this.

01:04:08.458 --> 01:04:09.291
[Patty] Yeah.

01:04:10.333 --> 01:04:13.875
-Okay. Hey, you two stick together, okay?
-Okay.

01:04:13.958 --> 01:04:16.458
-And stick to the plan.
-[Patty] Got it.

01:04:17.291 --> 01:04:18.625
We love you too!

01:04:20.208 --> 01:04:22.208
[both sigh]

01:04:23.333 --> 01:04:25.333
-I immediately regret this.
-So much.

01:04:25.416 --> 01:04:27.041
-Yeah. We should go.
-Yep.

01:04:28.125 --> 01:04:30.375
[energetic music playing]

01:04:32.583 --> 01:04:34.250
-I need eyes in the hall.
-On it.

01:04:40.041 --> 01:04:42.875
[gasps] Tony, we gotta hurry!

01:04:42.958 --> 01:04:45.583
[Tony] I'm trying to beat Hyskor
to stall for time.

01:04:47.958 --> 01:04:49.041
You lost.

01:04:50.166 --> 01:04:52.375
-I've got a new plan.
-What new plan?

01:04:52.458 --> 01:04:55.458
If we get to this elevator,
we can stop the countdown.

01:04:55.541 --> 01:04:59.083
That's not what they told us to do.
We have to stick to the plan.

01:04:59.166 --> 01:05:01.250
We have to do whatever it takes to win.

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:05.333
[roaring]

01:05:08.916 --> 01:05:09.875
[Patty exhales]

01:05:10.416 --> 01:05:12.416
I think you were right, Patty.

01:05:13.208 --> 01:05:14.208
About what?

01:05:15.541 --> 01:05:17.166
We're not gonna make it.

01:05:18.416 --> 01:05:20.500
-[clunking]
-[both scream]

01:05:21.166 --> 01:05:23.166
[suspenseful music playing]

01:05:29.333 --> 01:05:33.291
That must be the central computer.
I can use it to stop Armageddon.

01:05:36.541 --> 01:05:38.541
[keys tapping]

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.416
[Tony] Whoa.

01:05:41.166 --> 01:05:42.416
Wait a minute.

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:43.958
I know this.

01:05:44.625 --> 01:05:45.916
I made this.

01:05:46.583 --> 01:05:48.583
You made the Armageddon Code?

01:05:48.666 --> 01:05:53.208
Sort of. It was that weird puzzle
from Dad's work, but it wasn't a puzzle.

01:05:53.291 --> 01:05:57.333
-It was the plans for Armageddon Code.
-How are you gonna stop it though?

01:05:57.416 --> 01:05:58.791
The same way I solved it.

01:05:58.875 --> 01:06:01.250
The last part of the plan
had a trick to it,

01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:03.583
where you couldn't tell
if it was completed

01:06:03.666 --> 01:06:06.416
because you had to do
the same steps backwards.

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.625
That's how I'm going to break it.

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.083
[whirring, beeping]

01:06:11.166 --> 01:06:12.500
Okay. What do I do?

01:06:13.083 --> 01:06:14.875
-Press that button.
-Which one?

01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:19.666
-We're out of time!
-Almost there.

01:06:20.916 --> 01:06:24.708
You couldn't tell
if the code was completed or not.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.125
Tony, wait! Stop! It's a trick!

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.833
[Heck Knight] You have armed Armageddon.

01:06:31.916 --> 01:06:32.750
[Tony] What?

01:06:32.833 --> 01:06:34.208
I just stopped it.

01:06:34.791 --> 01:06:36.208
Wrong, Tony.

01:06:37.416 --> 01:06:40.250
You've put it together for me.

01:06:42.041 --> 01:06:45.166
-Mom! Dad!
-Oh, the whole family!

01:06:45.708 --> 01:06:48.416
You weren't able
to complete the code yourself, were you?

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.291
Even after you got the missing piece.

01:06:50.375 --> 01:06:55.041
Only the true code creator can activate
the world-conquering potential.

01:06:55.125 --> 01:06:59.708
I made this fake countdown
so you, Tony, could combine it for me.

01:06:59.791 --> 01:07:00.875
Thank you.

01:07:01.458 --> 01:07:04.958
We downloaded Hyskor last night
and caused all of this.

01:07:05.041 --> 01:07:08.500
No, no, no.
You just wanted to play a game.

01:07:09.333 --> 01:07:10.666
You didn't cause this.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:12.958
They did.

01:07:13.041 --> 01:07:15.333
And so did the rest of the world.

01:07:17.583 --> 01:07:19.000
Vargos was my father.

01:07:21.833 --> 01:07:24.000
From Operation Fireball?

01:07:24.083 --> 01:07:29.458
He was a genius that used his technology
to make our home country a better place.

01:07:29.541 --> 01:07:32.458
Sure, his head wasn't always
in the right spot,

01:07:32.541 --> 01:07:35.833
but someone could have helped guide him.

01:07:36.333 --> 01:07:41.000
But you OSS agents
laid waste to everything,

01:07:41.083 --> 01:07:45.000
stole Armageddon
as a weapon for yourselves.

01:07:45.083 --> 01:07:48.125
He would've improved the world
with his creation.

01:07:48.208 --> 01:07:51.958
But instead, my father spent
the last days of his life

01:07:52.041 --> 01:07:53.791
in some top secret prison.

01:07:55.166 --> 01:07:56.541
I never saw him again.

01:07:57.791 --> 01:08:00.625
I'm so sorry,
but we can't let you do this.

01:08:00.708 --> 01:08:05.875
The only way
to make this world better is by force,

01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:08.916
and my father's creation
will do just that.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.250
Armageddon Code, select target.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.500
[computer chirps]

01:08:13.583 --> 01:08:14.750

[ominous music playing]

01:08:17.083 --> 01:08:21.291
This entire broken planet
will be fixed by Hyskor,

01:08:21.875 --> 01:08:25.458
a game that makes you a better person
as you play.

01:08:26.583 --> 01:08:28.125
Because I'm in control.

01:08:28.666 --> 01:08:30.000
Enjoy your life

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
of play.

01:08:32.083 --> 01:08:33.250
No.

[music fades]

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:50.125
We did this all wrong.

01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:52.833
Yeah, we did.

01:08:53.791 --> 01:08:57.500
I'm sorry I wasn't a good spy
like you wanted me to be.

01:08:57.583 --> 01:09:00.333
No. I'm sorry, Patty.

01:09:00.416 --> 01:09:02.458
With your honest heart,

01:09:02.541 --> 01:09:04.916
you are better than I will ever be.

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:09.416
And you are so much more
than I could have hoped for.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.500
[gentle music playing]

01:09:13.541 --> 01:09:16.416
I wanted to win, Dad,
but I ended the world.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.916
No. No, you didn't, pal.
You didn't. I did.

01:09:20.833 --> 01:09:24.041
When you brought me the code,
and I didn't tell you the truth.

01:09:24.708 --> 01:09:26.500
I'm so, so, so, so sorry.

01:09:28.958 --> 01:09:33.916
Hey. How about you two show us
how to play this Hyskor game, huh?

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
We got nothing else to do
now that the world as we know it is over.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.208
Wait. There might still be
a way we can win this.

01:09:43.291 --> 01:09:45.916
-Oh…
-But we can't stop the King anymore.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.541
Well, not physically, obviously,
but we can stop him virtually, can't we?

01:09:50.625 --> 01:09:52.500
[mysterious music playing]

01:09:52.583 --> 01:09:56.458
Look. The King is using this VR pod
to control Armageddon.

01:09:56.541 --> 01:09:58.708
He is inside the game.

01:09:58.791 --> 01:10:02.541
But if we use these VR pods,

01:10:02.625 --> 01:10:05.708
then we can beat him
the same way you beat Hyskor.

01:10:06.708 --> 01:10:08.000
Reach the end of the world,

01:10:08.083 --> 01:10:10.166

-Yeah.
-This sounds crazy.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.291
It is crazy.

01:10:14.375 --> 01:10:15.250
Yeah.

01:10:15.875 --> 01:10:17.375
So let's do it.

Can you help us
play against the King in Hyskor?

01:10:53.125 --> 01:10:57.166
You're right, Patty. He's controlling
Armageddon from inside the game.

01:10:57.250 --> 01:11:00.750
But if we beat him before he locks us out,
we can save the world.

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:02.500
Here's my plan.

01:11:02.583 --> 01:11:05.083
We go in, but no cheats, no tricks,

01:11:05.166 --> 01:11:06.250
no rat skills.

01:11:07.041 --> 01:11:10.250
-We play fair together.
-Wait, we go into the video game?

01:11:10.333 --> 01:11:12.208
-Yeah.
-I think we need to regroup.

01:11:12.291 --> 01:11:14.750
-There's no time.
-We should call the OSS agents.

01:11:14.833 --> 01:11:16.416
Figure this out the spy way.

01:11:17.458 --> 01:11:19.875
I'm not following
the spy playbook anymore.

01:11:20.833 --> 01:11:24.458
Patty's been right all this time.
I trust her.

01:11:28.208 --> 01:11:29.791
-Then let's play.
-Let's go.

01:11:29.875 --> 01:11:33.916
[Patty] Dad, you know how you always
tell us video games will fry our brain?

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.958
-Yeah.
-If we lose…

01:11:36.041 --> 01:11:39.416
-This game might actually fry our brains.
-[Patty] Yeah.

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:42.791
-Wait, what'd they say?
-[chuckles] It's… She didn't…

No, Dad. It's an elevator.

Tony, you're playing as Rat Thickskull!

-And you're playing as Florella!
-Wait, what are these outfits?

01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:13.583
The game made you
play as a character called Tayanna.

01:12:13.666 --> 01:12:16.500
[Tony] And the game made you
play as a character called Itza.

01:12:16.583 --> 01:12:17.583
Got it.

Here we are.

Where are we?

We're at the end of the world. The finale
of the world's most challenging game.

Step one,

we have to get to that giant statue
to find the King.

-[Terrence] Are you sure this is right?
-[Torrez] Just keep up!

[groans] And there goes my back.

01:12:55.833 --> 01:12:58.791

to get to the statue.

[Patty] And with only nine minutes left.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.250
Wait. Why are there so many of them?

[Tony] It's a game.

01:13:06.708 --> 01:13:08.333
It's more fun that way.

we lose.

as you work through the game.

01:14:56.791 --> 01:14:58.791
So is that it? Did we win?

01:14:58.875 --> 01:15:03.708
No. It's time for step two.
We have to beat the last player standing.

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:05.500
The King.

01:15:05.583 --> 01:15:08.708
[Tony] But only one of us
can go in to face him.

01:15:08.791 --> 01:15:11.500
The rest of us
have to defeat his champion,

the Heck Knight.

You're the only one

who can beat the King
without losing all your health.

What? We have health?

01:15:22.041 --> 01:15:24.166
Yeah. Yours is low, Dad. Real low.

-No. Come on!

I don't know if I can win this
without my tricks or cheats.

What if I lose?

Well,

01:16:58.625 --> 01:17:01.541
it's a good thing I'm not Rat Thickskull.

01:17:01.625 --> 01:17:02.875
Hmm.

01:17:02.958 --> 01:17:06.000
Because Rat's not good at a lot of things.

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:07.666
He's a scoundrel.

He does anything to win.

01:18:10.791 --> 01:18:11.625
Really?

01:18:11.708 --> 01:18:13.833
If you can create your own world,

01:18:14.958 --> 01:18:17.166
why not make yourself the king? [echoes]

01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:20.291
You'll become the court jester
when I'm done with you.

01:18:20.375 --> 01:18:22.625
[laughing]

01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:27.375

[Terrence laughs]

01:18:35.166 --> 01:18:36.083
Oh!

01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:40.416
[Heck Knight] I cannot be defeated.

01:18:41.041 --> 01:18:43.166
Well, remember me?

01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:46.000
Yeah. I didn't have
this big ol' fist then, did I?

01:18:46.875 --> 01:18:49.250
Catch me…

01:18:52.166 --> 01:18:53.458
…eee!

01:18:54.208 --> 01:18:55.833
[Torrez] Oh, baby.

01:18:56.791 --> 01:18:57.750
[groans]

01:18:58.458 --> 01:18:59.458
Nice catch.

01:18:59.541 --> 01:19:00.541
But I love you.

01:19:06.541 --> 01:19:08.416
[rock music playing]

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:11.000
-We have to beat that Heck Knight.
-Honey.

01:19:11.083 --> 01:19:14.000
Let's do Operation Fireball,
but not our way.

01:19:15.958 --> 01:19:17.166
[both] Patty's way.

01:19:17.250 --> 01:19:19.666
[rock music intensifies]

01:19:21.875 --> 01:19:25.000
-You have been such a great challenge.
-We appreciate you.

01:19:25.083 --> 01:19:27.125
-Keep up the good work.
-You're golden.

01:19:35.666 --> 01:19:37.125
[Patty] Whoa!

01:19:37.208 --> 01:19:38.500
[grunts]

01:19:42.125 --> 01:19:44.833
Stay back! Don't come over here!

01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:52.333
-The ground is unstable. You'll fall.
-[Heck Knight] Why would I trust you?

01:19:52.416 --> 01:19:53.916
Because you can.

01:19:56.083 --> 01:19:58.166
-[Heck Knight roars]
-[Patty screams]

01:19:59.833 --> 01:20:01.958
[Terrence] Come on, big guy. [grunts]

01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:07.041
You did it. You found a better way.

01:20:07.125 --> 01:20:09.041
You saved the Heck Knight.

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:11.500
[gasps]

01:20:18.166 --> 01:20:19.541
Whoa!

01:20:21.541 --> 01:20:23.000
[Heck Knight] Florella,

01:20:23.083 --> 01:20:26.625
henceforth, I will follow you,

01:20:26.708 --> 01:20:30.416
for your integrity is pure.

01:20:31.166 --> 01:20:33.666
We did our part,
but we're running out of time.

01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:35.875
Tony has to win. Now.

01:20:36.416 --> 01:20:39.916
[dramatic music playing]

01:20:48.791 --> 01:20:49.958
-Whoo!
-Yes, Tony!

01:20:50.041 --> 01:20:52.708
[dramatic music intensifies]

01:20:57.791 --> 01:20:59.041
-No!
-What?!

01:21:02.708 --> 01:21:04.333
[The King] Come on, Rat.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.375
Use your tricks and cheats.

01:21:07.458 --> 01:21:08.375
[grunts]

01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:11.291
Ahh! Oof!

01:21:11.375 --> 01:21:12.625
Tony's in trouble.

01:21:12.708 --> 01:21:13.625
Dad, don't.

01:21:14.416 --> 01:21:15.416
[groans]

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:20.375
I have to help him.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.208
Your father's breaking the rules!

01:21:29.541 --> 01:21:30.833
Dad!

01:21:31.916 --> 01:21:33.000
No!

01:21:35.666 --> 01:21:37.666
[gentle guitar music playing]

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:45.041
-No, Dad. I have to do this myself.
-[whirring, beeping]

01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:48.958
[Tony, breathlessly] No… cheating.

01:21:53.791 --> 01:21:56.375
But I played fair.

01:21:56.458 --> 01:21:58.125
It doesn't matter.

01:21:59.416 --> 01:22:02.791
[whirring winds down]

01:22:02.875 --> 01:22:04.375
-No!
-Oh no! No, no!

01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:16.916
Victory is mine!

01:22:18.583 --> 01:22:20.458
[thunder crashing]

01:22:23.333 --> 01:22:25.458
[whirring]

01:22:30.875 --> 01:22:33.500
I never thought
anyone would ever earn that.

01:22:33.583 --> 01:22:35.000
-The One Hit.
-[Torrez] What?

01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:37.875
[Patty] Tony just received
the legendary One Hit,

01:22:37.958 --> 01:22:40.416
the mythical ability
hidden within the game.

01:22:43.583 --> 01:22:44.958
How did you…

01:22:45.041 --> 01:22:48.291
Maybe because I played the game
like my sister said.

01:22:50.875 --> 01:22:52.625
I believe her now.

01:22:52.708 --> 01:22:54.541
No. No. No!

01:22:54.625 --> 01:22:56.916
No!

01:22:58.291 --> 01:22:59.875
-Yeah!
-Yay!

01:22:59.958 --> 01:23:01.958
[triumphant choral music playing]

01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:04.833
[whirring winds down]

01:23:10.916 --> 01:23:12.083
[Tony] You lost.

01:23:13.458 --> 01:23:16.958
You won fair and square,
but I can't let you stop Armageddon.

01:23:17.041 --> 01:23:19.291
It's the only way to fix this world.

01:23:19.375 --> 01:23:23.625
You could have removed the One Hit
from the game, but you didn't.

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:29.125
Yes, but I stopped trusting this world
to make itself a better place.

01:23:30.083 --> 01:23:33.125
The only way to do it is by force.

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:36.458
Your games never forced me to play fair.

01:23:36.541 --> 01:23:38.291
My sister inspired me to.

01:23:38.916 --> 01:23:42.041
So now we just have to inspire the world
to be better.

01:23:42.541 --> 01:23:47.500
You know, instead of forcing everyone
to be gamers like us.

01:23:48.916 --> 01:23:49.916
Like us.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.250
It's true.

01:23:53.333 --> 01:23:57.166
You and your sister have shown
that maybe we do have the power to

01:23:57.250 --> 01:23:58.833
inspire them.

01:24:06.791 --> 01:24:08.583
He's running out of time!

01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:11.500
[rousing orchestral music playing]

01:24:24.833 --> 01:24:26.583
Shut down Armageddon.

01:24:28.083 --> 01:24:29.125
Yes.

01:24:29.208 --> 01:24:30.416
Okay.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.250
[zaps]

01:24:33.958 --> 01:24:35.958
[squeaky laughter]

01:24:38.041 --> 01:24:39.958
Yes! Yes, Tony!

01:24:40.041 --> 01:24:41.708
I knew you could do it.

01:24:50.250 --> 01:24:52.083
[electronic hum]

01:24:59.041 --> 01:25:00.666
[skeletons laugh and cheer]

01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:02.666
[Heck Knight] Tremendous effort.

01:25:03.666 --> 01:25:04.958
Well done.

01:25:08.041 --> 01:25:08.916
Tony.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.791
You showed me the goodness I thought
I could only find in a game world,

01:25:14.875 --> 01:25:16.208
and I… I thank you.

01:25:17.333 --> 01:25:20.041
-You've raised some wonderful children.
-We did.

01:25:20.125 --> 01:25:23.083
Congratulations, agents.
You have defeated your enemy.

01:25:23.166 --> 01:25:25.541
-What?
-Now the King must face his sentence.

01:25:25.625 --> 01:25:27.375
-There's a better way.
-What?

01:25:27.458 --> 01:25:30.125
Throwing him in prison
won't make him a good person.

01:25:30.208 --> 01:25:34.083
-Then where do we send him?
-This is why we need to make a change.

01:25:34.166 --> 01:25:35.875
Inside his own game.

01:25:36.708 --> 01:25:38.166
The only reason we won

01:25:38.250 --> 01:25:41.375
is because his game
makes you better as you play.

01:25:41.458 --> 01:25:46.000
-Hyskor has all the guidance he needs.
-That's not how we work in the OSS.

01:25:46.083 --> 01:25:47.125
Actually, it is.

01:25:47.208 --> 01:25:48.083
Excuse me?

01:25:48.166 --> 01:25:50.125
On page two of How To Be a Spy,

01:25:50.208 --> 01:25:53.875
it states that the high-level OSS agent
that catches the enemy

01:25:53.958 --> 01:25:56.125
is best suited to decide their judgment.

01:25:56.208 --> 01:26:00.458
And because we caught the enemy
and you didn't,

01:26:00.541 --> 01:26:02.875
that makes us the high-level agents.

01:26:02.958 --> 01:26:05.083
-[character] Ooh!
-[Heck Knight] Radical!

01:26:05.666 --> 01:26:06.625
Wow.

01:26:08.041 --> 01:26:10.125
-Smart kid.
-Yeah.

01:26:10.208 --> 01:26:14.583
Therefore, the King will be locked
inside his lair under OSS surveillance

01:26:14.666 --> 01:26:16.000
until he beats Hyskor.

01:26:16.083 --> 01:26:18.416
-[Heck Knight] Yes! [laughs]
-[cheering]

01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:20.666
What should have been done for your father

01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:22.125
we're going to do for you.

01:26:22.208 --> 01:26:23.708
You're saving me?

01:26:23.791 --> 01:26:27.375
You'll be saving yourself
by working through your own game.

01:26:27.458 --> 01:26:29.666
And with game theory,
anything can be fixed.

01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:30.750
Or anyone.

01:26:32.041 --> 01:26:33.708
Watch me on the screen.

01:26:33.791 --> 01:26:35.791
[tender music playing]

01:26:37.708 --> 01:26:39.208
[whirs]

01:26:44.375 --> 01:26:45.208
Thank you.

01:26:49.916 --> 01:26:54.041
I never thought our kids
would show us how to be great spies.

01:26:54.583 --> 01:26:57.416
They showed us how to be something better.

01:26:58.125 --> 01:27:03.125
Devlin, two decades of service with you
in the OSS has been an honor, but

01:27:04.416 --> 01:27:05.291
we quit.

01:27:05.375 --> 01:27:06.208
Excuse me?

01:27:06.291 --> 01:27:09.125
We'd rather figure out
our own way to save the world.

01:27:09.208 --> 01:27:11.375
Honestly and together.

01:27:11.458 --> 01:27:13.625
Sir. The Armageddon Code.

01:27:14.666 --> 01:27:16.958
-Is this the only copy?
-Yes, it is.

01:27:18.291 --> 01:27:20.291
-[Devlin] We don't need it.
-[chip crunches]

01:27:20.375 --> 01:27:24.583
Not in the new OSS. You might like
some of the changes we'll be making,

01:27:24.666 --> 01:27:29.083
to turn the OSS into a more effective
and honest job.

01:27:29.166 --> 01:27:32.250
-[Torrez] Then we're staying.
-See you at your desks Monday morning?

01:27:32.333 --> 01:27:33.375
[Terrence] Mm-hmm.

01:27:33.458 --> 01:27:34.416
Oh.

01:27:35.666 --> 01:27:36.666
All of your desks.

01:27:37.958 --> 01:27:42.166
All of our desks! Oh!
So proud of you, buddies.

01:27:42.250 --> 01:27:44.916

-Well, Spy Kids.

01:28:01.333 --> 01:28:02.416
Good morning, Devlin.

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:05.291
I have a little progress report
on your last mission.

gone back to normal,

01:28:16.125 --> 01:28:17.625
He did it.

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:19.875
He beat his game.

01:28:22.083 --> 01:28:23.541
