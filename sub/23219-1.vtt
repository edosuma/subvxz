00:15.400 --> 00:18.080
My name is Erin Quinn.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.920
I'm 16 years old,

00:19.960 --> 00:23.960
and I come from a place called
Derry, or Londonderry,

00:24.120 --> 00:25.960
depending on your persuasion,

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
a troubled little corner in the
Northwest of Ireland.

00:30.080 --> 00:33.840
It's fair to say I have a somewhat
complicated relationship

00:33.880 --> 00:36.360
with my home town.

00:36.400 --> 00:39.240
You see, the thing about
living in Derry is,

00:39.280 --> 00:41.480
there's nowhere to hide.

00:41.520 --> 00:45.520
Everybody knows everybody, knows
everything about everybody,

00:47.120 --> 00:51.120
and sometimes all I really want...

00:53.840 --> 00:57.840
...is to be simply left alone.

00:57.880 --> 01:01.880
Is that my diary?

01:06.800 --> 01:09.200
She's gone too far this time, Mama.

01:09.240 --> 01:11.440
What next? Trying on my knickers?

01:11.480 --> 01:13.360
Don't say "knickers" in front of
your father.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.880
He can't cope. Ah, he can cope.

01:14.920 --> 01:17.200
Sure, what's a pair of knickers
between cousins?

01:17.240 --> 01:18.840
Less of the knickers.

01:18.880 --> 01:20.760
I won't put up with it any more.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.640
Teenagers have rights now, you know.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.400
Don't be ridiculous. They do, Ma.

01:24.440 --> 01:28.440
It's true. Sure, Macaulay Culkin
might be divorcing his parents.

01:28.480 --> 01:32.000
D'ya hear this? This'll be someone
she met at that stupid summer scheme

01:32.040 --> 01:33.680
you insisted we send her on.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.440
Her bloody friends across the
barricades think.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.920
I have nothing against Protestants.

01:38.960 --> 01:42.200
I'm all for integration, I am,
but if they're letting their weans

01:42.240 --> 01:44.960
divorce them... Macaulay Culkin
isn't a Protestant, Ma.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.560
It's only going to give our weans
ideas.

01:46.600 --> 01:47.800
Well, he might be.

01:47.840 --> 01:50.080
I didn't meet him at
Friends Across The Barricades.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.336
I don't care where you met him.

01:51.360 --> 01:54.040
You're not to see him again.
Understood?

01:54.080 --> 01:55.640
Fine. Look at this.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.560
They're bombing the bridge,
apparently. No.

01:57.600 --> 02:00.800
TELEVISION: Suspicions were
raised when a hijacked van...

02:00.840 --> 02:03.120
Oh, dear God, no.

02:03.160 --> 02:05.720
Does this mean they can't get to
school?

02:05.760 --> 02:08.000
I've had a whole summer of it,
Gerry.

02:08.039 --> 02:09.560
She's melting my head.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.440
Sure, their bus can go the long way
round. I'll get it.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.200
TELEVISION: Major traffic
disruptions are anticipated...

02:15.240 --> 02:16.640
All right, Sarah.

02:16.680 --> 02:19.160
Them weans shouldn't have to
take the bus to school.

02:19.200 --> 02:22.200
You should be driving them, you
useless shite.

02:22.240 --> 02:23.800
I have to work, Joe. Work?

02:23.840 --> 02:25.360
Ha-ha! Is that what you call it?

02:25.400 --> 02:28.120
Yes. Why don't you just leave my
Mary alone?

02:28.160 --> 02:31.480
Because we've been married for 17
years, Joe.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.160
We have two children.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.360
And because we're in love with each
other.

02:35.400 --> 02:39.280
Oh, bunk. I'll find some dirt on you
yet, boy.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.320
I've got people working on it.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.640
God, Mammy.

02:43.680 --> 02:45.320
You're up early. So are you.

02:45.360 --> 02:46.840
You should be having a lie-in, love.

02:46.880 --> 02:48.080
You're on your holidays.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.400
First day of term, Sarah.

02:49.440 --> 02:53.440
Is it, aye? It is, aye.

02:54.240 --> 02:57.720
Well, I don't know about
the rest of you,

02:57.760 --> 02:59.960
but I'm not enjoying this bomb.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.400
Shocking. Desperate.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.080
Disgusting and disgraceful.

03:03.120 --> 03:06.080
I have an appointment in Tropicana
at 12:00.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.040
15 minutes in the stand up.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.200
Sure, I'll not get over the bridge
at this rate.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.040
It's going to play havoc with my
build-up.

03:12.080 --> 03:13.640
This is what they want.

03:13.680 --> 03:17.120
They want ordinary people to suffer.

03:17.160 --> 03:18.760
This is what it's all about.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.640
I'm pretty sure interfering with
your sunbed sessions

03:21.680 --> 03:23.000
isn't very high up

03:23.040 --> 03:25.080
on anyone's political agenda,
Aunt Sarah.

03:25.120 --> 03:28.880
I wouldn't be so sure.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.880
We'd better head.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.400
Hey!

03:32.440 --> 03:33.960
What do you think you're playing at?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.800
Where's your blazer?

03:36.840 --> 03:40.080
I've decided to put my own spin on
the uniform this year.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.640
I'll spin you across that floor.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.760
Get your blazer on.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.320
Look, Mammy. I'm not a clone.

03:45.360 --> 03:48.760
I should be allowed to express my
individuality.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.000
I'm sorry. I'm not wearing my
blazer.

03:51.040 --> 03:53.240
End of story.

03:53.280 --> 03:57.280
Gerry, pass me the wooden spoon.

04:05.600 --> 04:06.720
What's all this?

04:06.760 --> 04:08.840
I thought we were going to be
individuals this year.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.920
I wanted to, Clare, but my ma
wouldn't let me.

04:10.960 --> 04:14.960
Well, I'm not being
an individual on my own.

What's happening over there is
really lousy, Erin.

04:35.160 --> 04:36.640
Father Conway showed us a video.

04:36.680 --> 04:38.280
There's this one wee fella, Kamal.

04:38.320 --> 04:42.320
He's only ten, and every morning, he
walks 25 miles to the nearest well.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.000
From here to Buncrana.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.840

Shut up. From here to Ballybofey?

Sure, you'd be knackered.
Kamal is knackered.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.600
Are you sure Kamal isn't
exaggerating?

04:58.640 --> 04:59.800
Stop slagging off Kamal.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.000
Kamal doesn't have it easy.

Right. It's just I can't afford them

Have to give all my money to Kamal.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.280
Who the fuck's Kamal?

05:19.320 --> 05:22.560
He's a wee Ethiopian fella from

05:50.160 --> 05:51.840
What are you doing? Who are you
talking to?

05:51.880 --> 05:53.160
Erin, have you got a light?

05:53.200 --> 05:55.200
Me? No, I don't smoke.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.920
Why the hell do I not smoke?

05:56.960 --> 06:00.040
I have one. I don't smoke either.

06:00.080 --> 06:02.800
I just like melting stuff.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.720
Cool poster. Oh, do you think so?

06:04.760 --> 06:08.760
Yeah. Really nice use of, you know,
letters.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.760
Thanks. You should come along
tonight.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.480
You're inviting me to your gig?

06:13.520 --> 06:14.920
Yeah, well, all of you.

06:14.960 --> 06:18.960
But you'd specifically like me to
go, I mean, just so we're clear.

06:19.320 --> 06:21.360
But Erin, Murder She Wrote is on
tonight.

06:21.400 --> 06:22.920
You never miss Murder She Wrote.

06:22.960 --> 06:25.200
Shut up. We're going to be late.

06:25.240 --> 06:26.560
Yeah, kicks off at 6:00.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.520
Sweet. Cool.

06:28.560 --> 06:32.560
Maybe I'll see you there, then.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.440
You're not seriously going to this
concert, are you?

06:35.480 --> 06:36.920
Gig, Clare. It's called a gig.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.840
And I have to go. He invited me
specifically.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.800
Motherfuckers!

06:41.840 --> 06:43.760
"Motherfucker" is my new thing.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.040
Watched this film last night.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.520
My dad got it off Pyro Pauline, and
it's about these two lads,

06:47.560 --> 06:49.760
and they wear these cracking suits
and they rock about,

06:49.800 --> 06:52.440
just shooting people and eating
cheeseburgers, and they're all,

06:52.480 --> 06:55.160
"Motherfucker this, motherfucker
that." It's got your man in it.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.720
What do you call him? The disco
dancer from Look Who's Talking.

06:57.760 --> 07:00.840
Who owns the fella? Me.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.640
Well, come on, then, ball-ache.

07:02.680 --> 07:04.520
Are you introducing yourself, or
what?

07:04.560 --> 07:06.640
Hi. I'm Michelle's cousin, James.

07:06.680 --> 07:08.640
Why's he making that funny noise?

07:08.680 --> 07:10.960
He's English, Orla. That's the way
they talk.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.480
He's my Auntie Kathy's wean.

07:12.520 --> 07:13.840
I told you about my Auntie Kathy.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.880
She went to England years ago to
have an abortion.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.400
Never came back.
Never got the abortion, either.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.600
Lucky for you, James, eh?

07:21.640 --> 07:22.960
I didn't actually know that.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.320
What did he say?
Nothing interesting.

07:25.360 --> 07:28.960
What's he doing here? Kathy's just
got divorced, so she's moved back.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.840
The husband caught her doing the
dirt on him.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.696
She's a bit of a goer, is our Kathy,
riding rings around him, so she was.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.120
Ain't that right, James? No, I mean
here, at our bus stop.

07:36.160 --> 07:37.600
Oh, he's going to our school.

07:37.640 --> 07:40.760
But he's a fella. An effeminate
fella, but a fella all the same.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.360
Everyone was shitting it about
sending him to the boys' school.

07:43.400 --> 07:46.040
They were worried that the lads
would beat him up because, well...

07:46.080 --> 07:47.120
BOTH: He's English.

07:47.160 --> 07:49.960
Mm, and you couldn't really blame
them, I suppose.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
Our carriage awaits, motherfuckers.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.200
Avon.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.040
Avon.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.920
Avon. Um, we have a wee offer on
there

08:03.960 --> 08:07.600
for hair removal cream, if you
want to, with the...

08:07.640 --> 08:09.520
There's no seats down here.

08:09.560 --> 08:10.600
Just move them wee dicks.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.960
What?! Why should we sit up the
front?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.800
We're fifth years. They're foetuses.

08:14.840 --> 08:18.360
Come on.

08:18.400 --> 08:19.840
All right. Shift your shirt holes.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.520
Let's go. Nobody move.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.200
You'd better do as I say, or...
Or what?

08:25.240 --> 08:26.800
Or there'll be consequences.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.600
Such as?

08:28.640 --> 08:30.160
Well, we'll beat you up.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.800
Wonderful. Wait, Michelle.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.600
Go on, then.

08:33.640 --> 08:36.280
What? Beat me up.

08:36.320 --> 08:40.080
Well, not now.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.320
After school. We'll beat you up
after school.

08:42.360 --> 08:45.080
Grand. I'll meet you after school
and you can beat me up.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.400
What's happening, exactly?

08:46.440 --> 08:48.320
I'll bring my sister, Mandy.

08:48.360 --> 08:51.000
You might know her. Mandy O'Connell.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.760
She's an upper sixth. Big Mandy?

08:53.800 --> 08:55.920
Big Mandy is your sister? That's
right.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.640
Retreat.

08:57.680 --> 09:01.680
Listen, I think there's been a wee
bit of a misunderstanding.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.640
Thought you might say that.

09:03.680 --> 09:05.440
Now fuck off.

09:05.480 --> 09:07.400
Right. Will do.

09:07.440 --> 09:11.440
Wasn't at all humiliating.

09:17.760 --> 09:20.120
How long does this fast last?

09:20.160 --> 09:21.880
24 hours.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.880
So I still have...

09:24.920 --> 09:26.600
...almost 23 hours to go.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.440
Fuck me, not the Africans again.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.480
Imagine being born there and not
here.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.200
We don't know how lucky we are.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.120
Aye, fair dues. Derry has class.

09:34.160 --> 09:37.360

09:57.480 --> 10:00.120
What's going on? I dunno.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.600
But do you think if I told him I had
an incendiary device

10:02.640 --> 10:04.040
down my knickers, he'd have a look?

10:04.080 --> 10:06.320
Michelle, he's a soldier.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.880
Ach, some of them are all right. I'm
willing to admit it,

10:08.920 --> 10:11.880
even if nobody else will, because
I'm a beacon of truth, Erin.

10:11.920 --> 10:15.920
You're a mouth, that's what you are.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.040
Hi, guys.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.840
Could I just have a quick chat?

10:26.880 --> 10:30.320
You must be new. I'm Jenny.

10:30.360 --> 10:33.080
Great hair. Very bold.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.840
I'd love to go that short, but,
sure,

10:34.880 --> 10:36.440
I don't have the bone structure.

10:36.480 --> 10:38.280
He's a fella, Jenny.

10:38.320 --> 10:41.120
Oh. I see.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.800
Anyhoo... "Anyhoo."

10:42.840 --> 10:44.320
Seriously, shoot me in the face.

10:44.360 --> 10:45.520
This is a bit awkward,

10:45.560 --> 10:49.560
but part of my role as prefect is
welcoming the first-year students,

10:50.440 --> 10:51.960
and it's come to my attention

10:52.000 --> 10:55.040
that there was some sort of an
incident on the bus this morning.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.080
There was no incident.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.840
Apparently, you guys threatened one
of the new girls.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.320
Said you was going to beat her up.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.000
That's lies. There were quite a few
witnesses.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.840
No, I mean, we said it, but...

11:05.880 --> 11:08.680
...as a joke, as in, "We're going to
beat you up,"

11:08.720 --> 11:10.120
but, like, in a jokey way.

11:10.160 --> 11:14.160
Right. Well, the thing is, that's
not actually funny, is it?

11:14.200 --> 11:15.240
Like, at all.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.320
Well, humour is so subjective,
really, so...

11:17.360 --> 11:19.720
Now, the wee girl claims that
she's not bothered,

11:19.760 --> 11:21.360
but reading between the lines...

11:21.400 --> 11:23.280
Why are you reading between the
lines?

11:23.320 --> 11:25.800
I'm just not so sure that I believe
her.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.840
I don't want to report you guys.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.200
Please don't report us, Jenny.

anything at all.

over.

scary place...

schizo than usual?

11:55.600 --> 11:57.560

11:57.600 --> 12:00.600
Right now, you're like a little
seed,

12:00.640 --> 12:03.200

within which you can grow.

What you've just witnessed is a
piece of fiction.

12:35.440 --> 12:39.440
The reality, I'm sorry to say, is
much harsher, far more brutal.

12:39.520 --> 12:43.520
So let me take this opportunity to
advise all our new girls

12:44.120 --> 12:46.640
to keep their guard up.

watch their back,

study here

13:00.360 --> 13:02.640

13:02.680 --> 13:04.560
He was due to start at
Christian Brother Boys,

13:04.600 --> 13:07.120
but there were serious concerns for
his safety because, well,

13:07.160 --> 13:09.000
unfortunately, James happens to be
English.

the Mr Mullin affair.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.400

Student teacher. Two fourth-years
cable-tied him to the monkey bars

13:20.520 --> 13:23.160

really good-looking,

was bad enough.

it from memory.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.920
Then why were you pissing on her
dead body and making sandwiches?

20:11.960 --> 20:14.440
Say nothing, girls. Say nothing
till we've seen a lawyer.

20:14.480 --> 20:18.480
If you could all just take a seat.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.760
Sorry I'm late, sister.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.160
Couldn't get over the bridge.
This bloody bomb.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.400
I begged the Brits
to let me take my chances,

20:27.440 --> 20:29.400
but the awkward bastards
made me go the long way.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.520
Health and safety gone mad, Deidre.

20:31.560 --> 20:34.360
What are you playing at, rifling
through a dead nun's handbag?

20:34.400 --> 20:35.640
She stole my lipstick, Mammy.

20:35.680 --> 20:36.800
Don't lie.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.920
Sister Declan was a woman of God.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.840
Actually, she was known
to be a bit light-fingered.

20:41.880 --> 20:43.840
Where's my mum, Auntie Deidre?

20:43.880 --> 20:45.680
She's away back to London.

20:45.720 --> 20:46.760
What, without me?

20:46.800 --> 20:49.640
Oh, dry your eyes, James.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.360
Sorry to keep you waiting, Sister.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.720
How long does it take
to defuse a fecking bomb?

20:53.760 --> 20:56.920
Sure, the wee robots
do all the work.

20:56.960 --> 20:59.360
Oh, killing nuns now, is it?
I didn't, Daddy.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.880
You wait until your mother
hears about this.

21:01.920 --> 21:05.920
Obviously, Sister Declan's death was
extremely shocking and unexpected.

21:06.040 --> 21:08.600
We're still struggling to understand
exactly what happened.

21:08.640 --> 21:09.720
Yeah?

21:09.760 --> 21:12.920
Can I just ask,
what age was Sister Declan?

21:12.960 --> 21:15.440
She'd have been 98 on Friday.

21:15.480 --> 21:19.480
Right. Might that shed
some light on the situation?

21:19.600 --> 21:21.800
How so?

21:21.840 --> 21:24.200
Does anybody else have any
thoughts

21:24.240 --> 21:27.640
on the whole "her being
almost 98 years of age" thing?

21:27.680 --> 21:29.560
Struck down in her prime.

21:29.600 --> 21:32.920
The hospital are saying
it was heart failure,

21:32.960 --> 21:34.800
but I have my doubts.

21:34.840 --> 21:36.520
As I said on the phone,

21:36.560 --> 21:38.800
the circumstances
in which I found her body

21:38.840 --> 21:41.560
were... strange, to say the least.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.200
So I've decided to carry out

21:43.240 --> 21:45.720
a full investigation
into the incident.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.920
That makes sense.

21:47.960 --> 21:51.960
What?
Nothing about this makes sense.

21:52.040 --> 21:54.120
The woman was
almost 98 years of age.

21:54.160 --> 21:55.480
She had a heart attack.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.840
Why has everybody gone
absolutely mental?

21:57.880 --> 21:59.960
Less of the cheek, Erin.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.120
We didn't do anything.
It's not fair.

22:03.160 --> 22:05.720
"But the thing is, life isn't fair."

22:05.760 --> 22:09.680
"You see, injustice is something
I've become accustomed to."

22:09.720 --> 22:13.720
"I am, after all, a child of the
crossfire, surrounded by conflict."

22:15.240 --> 22:18.040
"But I choose to rise above it."

22:18.080 --> 22:22.080
"The path to peace is paved with
tolerance and understanding."

22:23.600 --> 22:27.600
"Violence is never the answer."

22:28.200 --> 22:33.100
I am going to ram that
so far up your arse!
