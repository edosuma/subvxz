WEBVTT

00:01.085 --> 00:02.453
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:02.489 --> 00:03.822
- Got you a coffee.
- Thank you.

00:03.857 --> 00:06.091
And I don't know if you take
it black or with milk or soy

00:06.127 --> 00:08.428
or anyway... I brought everything.

00:08.463 --> 00:10.698
Thank you. Look at that.

00:10.733 --> 00:12.033
Here you go.

00:12.068 --> 00:15.772
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.307
So what's up?

00:17.342 --> 00:19.210
So I wanted to get your
advice on something.

00:19.245 --> 00:21.546
But I... like, I probably
know what you're gonna say,

00:21.582 --> 00:25.785
which is what I need to
hear about something that...

00:25.820 --> 00:28.555
Sorry, I need to hear
you say "Don't do it."

00:28.591 --> 00:31.459
- Okay, I'm with you.
- Okay.

00:31.494 --> 00:35.298
Last night, I went out
with Roman, just as friends,

00:35.334 --> 00:40.305
but by the end it kind of
felt like more than that.

00:43.745 --> 00:47.114
- You don't seem surprised.
- I'm sorry, you...

00:47.149 --> 00:49.517
You wanted me... sure. My God!

00:49.553 --> 00:52.054
I mean, nothing has
happened at all... at all,

00:52.090 --> 00:56.728
but last night there was this moment...

00:56.763 --> 00:59.465
Do you know what I'm talking about?

00:59.500 --> 01:02.636
Yeah, I do.

01:02.671 --> 01:05.506
But having been engaged to
Ruzek, what you are saying is

01:05.541 --> 01:07.409
that I should not be
opening the door, right?

01:07.444 --> 01:11.314
You want me to be the one to tell you

01:11.349 --> 01:15.353
that you should not date your partner?

01:15.389 --> 01:17.823
- I...
- Yeah, no.

01:17.859 --> 01:20.227
You know why I forget? I forget sometimes

01:20.262 --> 01:21.929
that you and Jay are dating,

01:21.964 --> 01:26.502
'cause you guys make it look so easy.

01:26.537 --> 01:27.703
Really?

01:27.738 --> 01:29.706
<i>Units in 21 and units on the Citywide,</i>

01:29.741 --> 01:32.176
<i>battery in progress
involving a male and a female</i>

01:32.211 --> 01:33.679
<i>reported at Kinzie and Dearborn.</i>

01:33.714 --> 01:35.180
<i>First responding officers please advise.</i>

01:35.215 --> 01:37.984
- Let's roll.
- 2113 squad, I'm responding.

01:41.925 --> 01:43.291
Some guy just got stabbed.

01:43.327 --> 01:45.428
Okay, slow down. Get out of the street.

01:46.699 --> 01:48.498
- Where did it happen?
- Over there.

01:48.534 --> 01:50.401
- What did you see?
- This couple was arguing.

01:50.437 --> 01:53.205
- She was in her underwear.
- She was high on something,

01:53.240 --> 01:54.741
and she stabbed the guy and she ran.

01:54.776 --> 01:56.376
- Where did he go?
- He drove off.

01:56.411 --> 01:57.979
I don't know, north.

01:58.014 --> 02:00.649
And then some other guy ran
after to see if she was okay.

02:00.684 --> 02:03.219
- Wait, what guy?
- Him.

02:03.254 --> 02:05.622
I lost her. She tried to stab me.

02:05.658 --> 02:07.057
- I was just trying to help.
- Okay.

02:07.093 --> 02:08.526
Did you catch a plate, a type of car?

02:08.562 --> 02:10.328
It was silver, I'm not sure what kind.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.765
It was an Audi, A4 or A6.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.101
We need to send out a flash message.

02:14.136 --> 02:15.102
Yes. Where did she go?

02:15.137 --> 02:16.237
Right that way down the alley.

02:16.272 --> 02:17.972
Okay, I need the three
of you to stay here.

02:18.008 --> 02:20.542
You're all witnesses. Please stay here.

02:20.578 --> 02:22.379
Hey!

02:24.417 --> 02:25.449
Wait.

02:28.622 --> 02:30.690
- Down here!
- Go, go.

02:33.929 --> 02:35.897
Go.

02:40.973 --> 02:41.972
Stop.

02:44.511 --> 02:46.111
- Call it in.
- 2113 Squad,

02:46.147 --> 02:47.279
requesting additional units.

02:47.314 --> 02:49.015
Forced entry at 3233 South Princeton.

02:49.051 --> 02:50.283
We are entering the premises.

02:50.318 --> 02:52.820
There is a plainclothes
officer on the scene.

02:52.855 --> 02:54.356
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:08.811 --> 03:13.115
- Chicago PD, anyone in here?
- Burgess.

03:13.150 --> 03:15.118
I got it.

03:29.439 --> 03:31.006
Go.

03:31.042 --> 03:32.708
Drop it! Let me see your hands!

03:32.743 --> 03:34.077
Let me see your hands!

03:38.118 --> 03:40.486
Help me.

03:45.529 --> 03:47.898
- Victim's name is Ruby Baker.
- She says she was kidnapped.

03:47.933 --> 03:49.567
She stabbed her abductor
with a screwdriver

03:49.602 --> 03:51.169
she found in the trunk of his car.

03:51.204 --> 03:52.504
She got away. He drove off.

03:52.540 --> 03:54.339
This was a kidnapping in progress?

03:54.375 --> 03:55.642
No, Ruby thinks she was snatched

03:55.677 --> 03:57.478
about two months ago, maybe?

03:57.513 --> 03:58.913
She says she lost track.

03:58.948 --> 04:00.716
Kidnapper drugged her.
Next thing she knows,

04:00.751 --> 04:02.350
she's chained up in some room.

04:02.386 --> 04:04.287
We ran her through NCIC and LEADS.

04:04.322 --> 04:05.556
Nobody's reported her missing.

04:05.591 --> 04:07.926
She's still traumatized.
You can talk to her.

04:07.961 --> 04:09.561
- But go easy.
- All right, thanks.

04:09.596 --> 04:10.896
Can you get the evidence over to the lab?

04:10.932 --> 04:11.864
See if they can put a rush on it.

04:11.899 --> 04:13.700
Yeah, got it.

04:13.736 --> 04:15.168
Done a rape kit yet?

04:15.204 --> 04:16.437
She's refusing medical treatment.

04:16.473 --> 04:17.772
She won't let us touch her.

04:17.807 --> 04:20.676
She's 19, so technically,
we can't force her.

04:20.711 --> 04:22.278
- Thanks, Natalie.
- Yeah.

04:25.318 --> 04:30.790
Ruby, this is Sergeant Voight,
and that's Detective Olinsky.

04:30.825 --> 04:33.427
- Did you get him?
- Not yet.

04:33.462 --> 04:36.598
We're hoping that you
can help us with that.

04:36.633 --> 04:39.903
Ruby, the man you stabbed,
was that your kidnapper?

04:39.938 --> 04:42.305
Mister.

04:42.341 --> 04:43.908
Just Mister.

04:43.943 --> 04:45.778
That's what he made me call him.

04:45.813 --> 04:48.882
What else can you tell us about this man?

04:48.917 --> 04:53.655
He was tall. He had sandy brown hair.

04:53.690 --> 04:57.760
That's great. Is there anything else?

04:57.796 --> 05:01.299
His nose. It looked like it'd been broken.

05:01.334 --> 05:04.003
Like, a long time ago.

05:04.038 --> 05:09.243
And he always parts his
hair, like a politician.

05:11.414 --> 05:13.649
Did he force himself on you?

05:17.924 --> 05:21.493
I'm sorry. Where were you held?

05:21.528 --> 05:25.231
- Was it a house, a building?
- A room, with no windows.

05:25.267 --> 05:27.201
He didn't want me to
know what time it was.

05:27.236 --> 05:30.071
And he wouldn't let me leave,
not even to use the bathroom.

05:30.106 --> 05:32.341
I used a bucket.

05:32.376 --> 05:36.147
He... got off on that.

05:36.182 --> 05:38.851
Ruby, do you remember any
other details of that room?

05:38.886 --> 05:42.222
- Sounds?
- I heard kids playing.

05:42.257 --> 05:44.191
Almost every day.

05:44.227 --> 05:48.430
And yesterday I heard
sirens, lots of them.

05:48.465 --> 05:51.868
I thought I was being rescued.

05:53.239 --> 05:55.740
So how'd you end up outside?

05:55.775 --> 05:59.111
Mister... or whatever
the hell his name is...

05:59.146 --> 06:01.548
he said we had to move.

06:01.583 --> 06:02.582
He threw me in the trunk.

06:02.619 --> 06:07.589
I kept banging till he pulled over.

06:07.625 --> 06:09.559
That's when I stabbed him.

06:11.597 --> 06:14.966
Listen, none of us can imagine
what you've been through,

06:15.002 --> 06:19.072
and I'm sure you just
want to try to forget,

06:19.108 --> 06:22.644
but we really need you
to do something for us.

06:22.679 --> 06:25.314
We need you to let the
doctors give you a rape kit.

06:25.349 --> 06:27.484
I... I can't stay here.

06:27.519 --> 06:29.353
He said he'll find me.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.721
I'm not going back to that place.

06:30.757 --> 06:33.458
Well, we'll have an officer
posted outside your door.

06:34.996 --> 06:36.796
Can you stay?

06:36.831 --> 06:39.366
Sure, yeah. I can stay.

06:45.109 --> 06:47.511
Sarge, think I narrowed down the location.

06:47.546 --> 06:48.546
All right.

06:48.581 --> 06:50.816
So Ruby said that she jumped out the car

06:50.851 --> 06:52.217
at Kinzie and Dearborn.

06:52.253 --> 06:54.721
Told Olinsky that they drove
around for about ten minutes.

06:54.756 --> 06:56.257
That would put her approximate location

06:56.292 --> 06:57.825
in this six-mile radius.

06:57.871 --> 07:00.072
Ruby heard kids and sirens,
which means we're looking for

07:00.107 --> 07:01.808
someplace near a school or playground.

07:01.843 --> 07:03.009
There's a bunch of them in that area.

07:03.044 --> 07:05.312
Has anyone read Ruby's rap sheet?

07:05.348 --> 07:06.882
In the last year alone
she's been picked up

07:06.917 --> 07:09.852
for credit card fraud, retail
theft, possession of heroin.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.220
Where'd she say she was grabbed from?

07:11.256 --> 07:12.823
Pin Pan Alley.

07:12.858 --> 07:14.458
Pool hall on Ashland?

07:14.493 --> 07:15.994
That's a hangout for runaways.

07:16.029 --> 07:17.596
Lots of teen prostitution.

07:17.632 --> 07:20.467
So she's got a history,
like everybody else.

07:20.502 --> 07:22.102
All right, where we at with the composite?

07:22.137 --> 07:24.505
It just came in.

07:24.541 --> 07:26.175
All right, so circulate
it to all hospitals,

07:26.210 --> 07:27.576
urgent care centers.

07:27.611 --> 07:29.078
See if anyone matching this description

07:29.114 --> 07:30.948
came in with a stab wound.

07:30.983 --> 07:34.619
Antonio, you and Jay hit that pool hall.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.656
Hey, where's the thing, requisition forms?

07:36.691 --> 07:38.157
- Grab those too.
- Copy that.

07:38.193 --> 07:40.627
Hey. Looking very official.

07:40.663 --> 07:42.831
Drowning up here. Platt's riding my ass.

07:42.866 --> 07:43.832
And my hangover doesn't help,

07:43.867 --> 07:44.967
which I have you to blame for that.

07:45.002 --> 07:46.670
I'm sorry, who ordered the last round?

07:46.705 --> 07:48.672
Hey, heard you caught a weird one.

07:48.707 --> 07:50.541
Yeah, it was
bizarre. There's a girl...

07:50.577 --> 07:51.909
Cherish the anecdote, Burgess.

07:51.945 --> 07:55.381
As of 11 minutes ago. I am
on furlough for one week,

07:55.417 --> 07:56.783
preparing for the wedding my father

07:56.818 --> 07:58.652
always dreamed he drop the ball on.

07:58.688 --> 08:00.155
And you, Haircut.

08:00.190 --> 08:05.194
Ivory tower's issued a district
audit, due by end of shift.

08:05.230 --> 08:06.697
Sarge, this came out a month ago.

08:06.732 --> 08:08.466
This is desks, computers, pencils,

08:08.501 --> 08:10.134
everything in the building.

08:10.170 --> 08:12.104
That is accurate.

08:12.139 --> 08:14.040
And the serial numbers on each item

08:14.076 --> 08:16.577
have to match up with
the numbers on the list.

08:16.613 --> 08:18.981
- By the end of the shift?
- It's okay.

08:19.016 --> 08:20.816
We'll get it done. I'll help you.

08:20.851 --> 08:22.018
Yes, help.

08:22.053 --> 08:23.753
Don't help. I don't care.

08:26.025 --> 08:28.426
- Burgess?
- Yeah?

08:28.462 --> 08:31.330
As you are well aware, my
wedding is 12 days hence.

08:33.335 --> 08:35.370
I need someone to help keep me on my feet

08:35.405 --> 08:38.941
with respect to alcohol and such what.

08:38.976 --> 08:42.044
You want me to help?

08:42.080 --> 08:43.981
Are you inviting me?

08:44.017 --> 08:46.652
I guess I am. But no plus one.

08:46.687 --> 08:49.188
Yours is the last salmon
filet we have left.

08:50.659 --> 08:51.892
- Take another look.
- Yeah.

08:51.928 --> 08:54.496
I've seen her and 20
more girls just like her.

08:54.531 --> 08:55.630
Don't be a jagoff, all right?

08:55.666 --> 08:57.099
We think she was abducted from here.

08:57.135 --> 09:00.070
I'm saying a lot of
girls her age come and go.

09:00.105 --> 09:01.138
I don't keep track.

09:01.173 --> 09:02.473
You have surveillance cameras here?

09:02.509 --> 09:05.077
Think the guy who owns this
place cares about his employees?

09:05.112 --> 09:06.746
Does he? I haven't met the guy.

09:06.782 --> 09:09.617
He doesn't. Only thing he
cares about is his money,

09:09.652 --> 09:12.120
so he has a camera right
over the safe in back.

09:12.156 --> 09:14.891
- And nowhere else.
- That's him.

09:14.926 --> 09:16.025
- No?
- Nah, sorry, man.

09:16.061 --> 09:18.262
I haven't seen her.

09:18.297 --> 09:21.599
- What about you?
- No.

09:23.037 --> 09:26.106
You looking for Ruby?

09:26.141 --> 09:28.843
- Who are you?
- We used to be tight.

09:28.878 --> 09:30.645
That so?

09:30.680 --> 09:33.349
Then what, Ruby was
kidnapped. You know by who?

09:33.385 --> 09:37.154
No. Damn. Kidnapped?

09:37.190 --> 09:39.391
Tell me about the last time you saw her.

09:39.426 --> 09:43.129
We, got in a fight. About money.

09:43.164 --> 09:45.399
So she went to work.

09:45.434 --> 09:50.439
- And by work you mean?
- Ruby went on dates, with guys.

09:50.475 --> 09:53.610
- This guy?
- I didn't get a look at him.

09:53.645 --> 09:56.347
Just his car. It was expensive.

09:56.383 --> 09:59.284
- Like an Audi?
- Yeah.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.254
Yeah, like one of those.

10:04.727 --> 10:07.562
My brother. This your normal route?

10:07.598 --> 10:09.065
You lose your mail or something?

10:09.100 --> 10:11.535
We're actually looking for
a guy who lives around here.

10:11.570 --> 10:14.239
Yeah, this guy look familiar?
He drives a silver Audi.

10:14.274 --> 10:15.940
Yeah, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:15.976 --> 10:18.310
5381 Bristol. Next block over.

10:18.346 --> 10:19.846
You wouldn't happen to know his name?

10:19.882 --> 10:22.216
No, there's been a mail
hold on that address.

10:22.252 --> 10:24.086
I never delivered a letter to the house,

10:24.121 --> 10:25.154
but I seen him come and go.

10:25.189 --> 10:27.257
All right, thank you, brother.

10:35.303 --> 10:37.103
Chicago PD!

10:40.143 --> 10:41.476
All right, watch out, bro.

10:41.511 --> 10:43.279
Whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on.

10:43.314 --> 10:45.314
5381.

10:52.426 --> 10:55.095
My aunt's a realtor. They all do it.

10:58.802 --> 10:59.835
Stairs.

11:03.041 --> 11:05.576
Police! Anybody in here?

11:14.623 --> 11:17.358
- Hey, we're clear upstairs!
- Copy.

11:22.601 --> 11:25.269
Hey, Kev, hey.

11:25.304 --> 11:26.872
Looks like there used to be locks here.

11:26.907 --> 11:28.841
That's a lot of security
for an interior door.

11:46.567 --> 11:49.135
We're clear.

11:49.171 --> 11:50.971
- You ready?
- Yeah.

11:51.007 --> 11:53.475
One, two, three.

12:03.391 --> 12:05.959
- You smell that?
- I hate bleach.

12:05.994 --> 12:07.761
Yeah, he wiped the place clean.

12:11.535 --> 12:13.636
Ruby said he had her chained up to a wall.

12:15.874 --> 12:18.910
Yeah. Lindsay was right.

12:18.946 --> 12:20.579
All right, Mouse says
that the house belongs

12:20.614 --> 12:22.114
to Bill and Ruth Gainsbridge.

12:22.150 --> 12:24.083
They moved to Florida three months ago.

12:24.118 --> 12:26.787
No sign of forced entry, so
somebody must've had the key.

12:26.823 --> 12:29.424
We'll get Mouse to get ahold
of the real estate company,

12:29.459 --> 12:31.961
get us a picture of the listing agent.

12:31.996 --> 12:33.930
What's that?

12:39.473 --> 12:41.474
She was trying to get out.

12:50.688 --> 12:52.689
My daughter loves these.

12:53.927 --> 12:55.727
And I'm addicted to them too.

12:57.398 --> 12:58.932
You have a daughter?

12:58.967 --> 13:01.869
Two, actually.

13:01.904 --> 13:06.441
One's your age, Lexi. And Michelle.

13:06.477 --> 13:09.012
You close?

13:09.047 --> 13:11.315
Well, as close as they want me to be.

13:16.291 --> 13:19.393
What about you? What about your parents?

13:19.428 --> 13:21.896
My dad died when I was eight.

13:21.931 --> 13:24.266
I haven't talked to my mom in years.

13:29.108 --> 13:30.942
What happened to your arm?

13:32.680 --> 13:33.680
Nothing.

13:36.652 --> 13:38.419
Can I see it?

13:48.068 --> 13:52.872
Man. He did this?

13:52.908 --> 13:56.243
I did it to myself.

13:56.279 --> 13:58.780
So I wouldn't forget
who I was in that place.

14:00.819 --> 14:06.524
He kept repeating how I was nothing,

14:06.560 --> 14:10.997
that he was going to
turn me into someone else.

14:11.033 --> 14:14.235
I had to "submit"

14:14.270 --> 14:17.039
until I was "purified."

14:17.074 --> 14:21.378
That's what he called it.

14:21.413 --> 14:23.247
Detective?

14:23.282 --> 14:25.350
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

14:28.356 --> 14:30.324
I'll be right outside.

14:33.597 --> 14:34.763
Yeah?

14:34.798 --> 14:36.399
We got the results back from the rape kit.

14:36.434 --> 14:37.734
Okay.

14:37.770 --> 14:39.169
Ruby's pregnant.

14:48.112 --> 14:52.150
No. This can't be happening.

14:52.186 --> 14:53.886
I can't have his baby.

14:53.922 --> 14:56.457
We'll do an ultrasound to
see how far along you are.

14:56.492 --> 14:57.725
You still have options.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.928
Can you do a paternity test?

14:59.963 --> 15:01.529
Prove what he did to me?

15:01.566 --> 15:03.666
We can do an amniocentesis,

15:03.701 --> 15:05.636
but there are risks.
It could harm the baby.

15:08.508 --> 15:09.642
I know you got a million things

15:09.677 --> 15:12.512
going through your mind right now,

15:12.547 --> 15:15.950
but I'm gonna need you
to look at some photos,

15:15.985 --> 15:17.986
see if you recognize any of these men.

15:20.925 --> 15:22.859
Can you do that?

15:25.164 --> 15:27.098
Okay.

15:31.573 --> 15:34.208
God.

15:34.244 --> 15:37.413
Ruby, Ruby...

15:37.448 --> 15:40.884
You need to say it.

15:40.919 --> 15:44.656
Which one abducted
you? You need to say it.

15:56.641 --> 15:58.375
That's him.

15:58.410 --> 16:01.412
Drew Stommer, real estate
agent at Cermak Reality.

16:01.448 --> 16:02.714
Business degree at Northwestern,

16:02.749 --> 16:04.216
minor is psychology.

16:04.251 --> 16:06.519
Never married, no kids, no priors.

16:06.555 --> 16:08.889
This guy looks like the
world's most eligible bachelor.

16:08.925 --> 16:10.725
That's what they said about Ted Bundy.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.527
We got the results of
Ruby's ultrasound back.

16:12.563 --> 16:14.397
She is seven weeks pregnant,

16:14.432 --> 16:16.099
which means it's Stommer's.

16:16.134 --> 16:17.801
I called the owners of
the house on Bristol.

16:17.837 --> 16:20.105
They told Stommer to put it
on the market six months ago

16:20.140 --> 16:22.174
He didn't list it on MLS till last week,

16:22.210 --> 16:24.311
which means he's been
sitting on the house.

16:24.346 --> 16:25.746
Yeah, to hide Ruby.

16:25.781 --> 16:27.749
And he had to move her because
the house was about to sell.

16:27.784 --> 16:29.952
Perfect, all right,
thank you. Guys.

16:29.987 --> 16:32.288
Stommer, I just ran him through the DMV.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.925
He's the registered owner
of a silver 2004 Audi A4.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.560
His office says that he's hosting

16:36.596 --> 16:38.396
an open house at a property in Hyde Park.

16:38.432 --> 16:40.833
All right, Antonio, you and
Lindsay go pick this guy up.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.568
No, I'll pick him up.

16:42.604 --> 16:45.239
Okay, you and Atwater.

16:45.274 --> 16:46.508
Jay, get a warrant for his house.

16:46.543 --> 16:48.511
I want you to search it top to bottom.

16:52.484 --> 16:55.319
- Ruzek, you got a sec?
- Yeah.

16:55.355 --> 16:56.488
Platt has me doing inventory.

16:56.524 --> 16:58.390
I notice you signed in a laptop last week,

16:58.425 --> 17:00.260
but it's not in the evidence locker.

17:00.295 --> 17:01.261
Any chance you know where it is?

17:01.296 --> 17:02.797
It says I signed it back in.

17:02.832 --> 17:03.964
Yeah, it was on Wednesday.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.333
Well, then it's got to be there somewhere.

17:05.368 --> 17:07.069
No, I checked twice already. No laptop.

17:07.105 --> 17:09.338
You really gonna bust my balls about this?

17:09.374 --> 17:10.808
I have to have the inventory done

17:10.843 --> 17:12.777
by the end of the shift, so.

17:12.813 --> 17:16.915
Well, I got a case to work, so.

17:16.951 --> 17:18.785
You ask about the laptop?

17:18.820 --> 17:20.387
Look, I'm not saying he stole it, but...

17:20.423 --> 17:22.522
Adam once lost a pair of boots
while he was wearing them.

17:22.559 --> 17:25.060
So it'll turn up. Don't stress.

17:26.998 --> 17:28.999
All new flooring, and did I mention

17:29.035 --> 17:30.935
we are in an A-plus school district?

17:30.971 --> 17:32.504
Great place to raise children.

17:32.539 --> 17:33.572
Drew Stommer?

17:33.607 --> 17:35.408
Excuse me. I'll be right with you.

17:35.443 --> 17:38.011
You're under arrest for
kidnapping and sexual assault.

17:38.047 --> 17:40.915
Chicago cops. You believe this?

17:40.951 --> 17:42.618
In front of clients?

17:42.653 --> 17:44.788
I'm gonna have your jobs.

17:44.823 --> 17:47.091
I'm gonna recommend you
use your right to be silent.

18:00.612 --> 18:02.144
Chicago PD.

18:08.923 --> 18:12.292
Is something wrong with the doorbell?

18:12.327 --> 18:14.262
Chicago police. Do you live here?

18:14.297 --> 18:16.030
Of course. What is this about?

18:16.065 --> 18:18.133
Ma'am, are you related to Drew Stommer?

18:18.168 --> 18:20.136
I'm his wife, Madison.

18:22.508 --> 18:24.409
We have a warrant to search the premises.

18:27.615 --> 18:29.482
We're gonna come inside.

18:29.517 --> 18:32.420
Excuse me.

18:32.455 --> 18:33.421
Where is Drew?

18:33.456 --> 18:34.923
And what is this all about?

18:36.694 --> 18:37.827
Among other things, your husband's

18:37.863 --> 18:40.297
been arrested for kidnapping.

18:40.333 --> 18:44.836
Kidnapping? Kidnapping who?

18:44.872 --> 18:46.272
You know, I really should call my husband.

18:46.308 --> 18:47.674
Sit down.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.643
He's not taking calls right now.

18:53.016 --> 18:54.583
Hey.

18:54.619 --> 18:57.587
You're gonna want to see this.

18:57.623 --> 18:59.590
Come on.

19:02.563 --> 19:04.163
Mrs. Stommer, do you have a child?

19:04.198 --> 19:06.866
Drew says we're going to have one soon.

19:06.902 --> 19:08.736
So you're expecting?

19:11.709 --> 19:14.310
We're trying.

19:14.346 --> 19:15.713
Drew says that setting up the nursery

19:15.748 --> 19:17.983
will help to manifest the baby.

19:18.018 --> 19:20.953
He says if you can visualize
it, you can make it true.

19:25.127 --> 19:27.729
Okay.

19:27.764 --> 19:29.398
We're gonna need you to
come down to the station

19:29.433 --> 19:32.268
and answer a few questions.

19:40.548 --> 19:42.349
Recognize her?

19:42.385 --> 19:45.787
We know you were holding her
at the Bristol Street house.

19:45.822 --> 19:48.791
So you got two options:

19:48.826 --> 19:50.694
We can get your DNA and prove as much,

19:50.729 --> 19:51.962
or you can come clean.

19:51.997 --> 19:53.431
I mean, I can save you the trouble.

19:53.466 --> 19:56.101
The DNA will be a match.

19:56.137 --> 19:58.304
So you admit to sexually
assaulting Ruby Baker.

19:58.340 --> 20:00.775
No. She gave me permission.

20:00.810 --> 20:01.842
To rape her?

20:01.878 --> 20:05.414
Ruby and I entered a
dominant-submissive relationship.

20:05.449 --> 20:07.750
I paid for sex and provided
her a place to live.

20:07.786 --> 20:11.756
In return, Ruby submitted herself to me.

20:11.792 --> 20:14.126
It was consensual.

20:14.162 --> 20:16.228
Man...

20:16.264 --> 20:18.932
Forgive me, but...

20:18.967 --> 20:22.871
she stabbed you and ran for her life.

20:22.907 --> 20:24.774
That doesn't sound consensual.

20:26.978 --> 20:29.714
Last week, Ruby started
behaving erratically.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.950
She threatened to blackmail me.

20:31.985 --> 20:33.786
I had no choice, I had to
terminate our agreement.

20:33.822 --> 20:35.155
So I drove her back into the city.

20:35.191 --> 20:36.990
Did you know Ruby was pregnant?

20:37.026 --> 20:38.226
Seven weeks.

20:38.261 --> 20:39.861
Well, she's a prostitute.

20:39.896 --> 20:42.765
I imagine that's an occupational hazard.

20:46.940 --> 20:48.574
Will you give us a second?

20:56.252 --> 20:57.686
I don't know where to put her, Sarge.

20:57.721 --> 20:59.689
She says her name is Madison,

20:59.724 --> 21:02.626
and not only is her marriage
to Stommer not official,

21:02.661 --> 21:05.663
she doesn't exist as a person.

21:05.699 --> 21:08.300
Secretary of State's got no
record of a Madison Stommer

21:08.336 --> 21:10.904
so I ran the maiden name
she provided, "Madison Dodd."

21:10.939 --> 21:12.607
The social matches a woman in Mt. Vernon,

21:12.642 --> 21:15.009
but the DOBs don't match.

21:15.044 --> 21:16.445
You check Cook County?

21:16.480 --> 21:18.181
I ran all cross checks.

21:18.216 --> 21:20.718
She doesn't have so much as
a library card to her name.

21:20.753 --> 21:22.386
I ran Madison's prints.

21:22.421 --> 21:25.023
Her real name is Jamie Lynn Stevens.

21:25.058 --> 21:26.959
Says she went missing seven years ago.

21:34.206 --> 21:37.776
Dr. Charles. Appreciate you coming down.

21:37.811 --> 21:39.979
Isn't it about time we put
my prints on the palm scanner?

21:40.015 --> 21:41.514
Yeah, right after we finish

21:41.549 --> 21:43.650
your personalized parking space.

21:43.686 --> 21:45.120
I got to tell you, Hank.

21:45.155 --> 21:47.390
I've never quite
received this call before.

21:48.526 --> 21:50.060
Hey, Jay, it's inventory day.

21:50.095 --> 21:53.097
I have you down for the
receipt of two lipstick cameras?

21:53.133 --> 21:54.532
Yeah, yeah, the lipstick cameras.

21:54.567 --> 21:56.869
I got 'em here somewhere.

21:56.904 --> 22:00.340
We drilled these into a vice
lord's baby mama's house.

22:00.375 --> 22:01.942
Here you go.

22:01.978 --> 22:04.146
What we know he doesn't?
Mamacita's cheating on him...

22:04.181 --> 22:05.147
With his sister.

22:05.182 --> 22:06.983
- His sister?
- Yeah.

22:07.018 --> 22:08.485
Nice. Thanks for these.

22:08.521 --> 22:10.988
Yeah, man.

22:11.023 --> 22:13.926
Hey, Ruzek. Any luck with the laptop?

22:13.961 --> 22:15.895
No.

22:22.473 --> 22:24.106
This is Sergeant Voight,

22:24.141 --> 22:26.276
and this is my friend Dr. Charles.

22:26.311 --> 22:28.079
He's a psychiatrist at Chicago Med.

22:28.114 --> 22:29.948
We asked him to sit in with us.

22:29.983 --> 22:32.652
A psychiatrist. I need to consent to that.

22:32.687 --> 22:34.353
It's just a conversation.

22:37.961 --> 22:39.794
Do you recognize this girl?

22:42.900 --> 22:45.669
Her name's Jamie Lynn Stevens.

22:45.704 --> 22:47.638
This is you.

22:47.674 --> 22:50.909
That's not me.

22:50.945 --> 22:54.048
We know that it's you
from your fingerprints.

22:56.185 --> 22:57.686
You have a younger sister named Caitlin,

22:57.721 --> 22:59.188
and she misses you very much.

22:59.224 --> 23:01.591
I'm sorry. I think you must have me

23:01.626 --> 23:04.361
confused with someone else.

23:04.396 --> 23:08.167
If it's not you, than who is it?

23:08.258 --> 23:10.026
Because Jamie Lynn is missing.

23:12.297 --> 23:14.498
You know what I think?

23:14.533 --> 23:18.270
I think maybe seven years ago or so,

23:18.306 --> 23:22.842
Jamie Lynn, a confused young woman,

23:22.878 --> 23:23.811
went looking for help.

23:23.846 --> 23:25.413
Jamie Lynn is dead.

23:25.448 --> 23:28.283
And what she found terrified her,

23:28.319 --> 23:31.054
and nobody could blame her for that.

23:31.089 --> 23:35.527
In fact, it terrified her so much that

23:35.562 --> 23:40.200
she convinced herself that
Jamie Lynn needed to disappear

23:40.236 --> 23:43.137
so that Madison could survive.

23:43.173 --> 23:46.075
I... I chose to be with Drew.

23:46.110 --> 23:49.379
Well, Drew, your husband,

23:49.414 --> 23:51.716
he just admitted to hiring prostitutes

23:51.751 --> 23:54.953
to be his S&M partners.

23:54.989 --> 23:56.623
Drew said never to trust the police.

23:56.658 --> 23:58.759
Let me tell you what I think.

23:58.794 --> 24:02.564
I think you and your husband
used Ruby Baker as a concubine

24:02.599 --> 24:04.200
just so you could have a baby.

24:04.235 --> 24:06.303
I don't know anyone by that name.

24:06.338 --> 24:07.437
You know what I think?

24:07.473 --> 24:09.274
I think that you're a good person,

24:09.309 --> 24:11.810
and that you want to do the right thing.

24:11.846 --> 24:13.947
And we just want to help you do that.

24:16.719 --> 24:19.621
If my husband hasn't already asked,

24:19.657 --> 24:21.390
we would like a lawyer.

24:27.534 --> 24:28.466
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

24:28.502 --> 24:29.768
Yeah, you owe me a dollar.

24:29.803 --> 24:32.906
Shut up. Okay.

24:32.941 --> 24:34.408
So look at this.

24:34.443 --> 24:36.944
I know we're down a laptop...
which will turn up, I promise.

24:36.980 --> 24:40.149
But, check this out.

24:40.184 --> 24:43.621
Somebody owes the district
a 2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee.

24:43.656 --> 24:44.922
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

24:44.957 --> 24:47.859
We are missing a $30,000 SUV.

24:47.895 --> 24:49.462
Think Platt'll notice that.

24:49.497 --> 24:52.032
And whose handwriting is that?

24:52.068 --> 24:54.569
- Voight's?
- Yeah, Voight.

24:54.604 --> 24:57.940
Voight stole a car, nine months ago.

24:57.975 --> 25:00.944
You said that.

25:00.979 --> 25:04.282
All right, I'll go talk to him.

25:04.317 --> 25:06.085
What, you think I'm scared
to talk to Sergeant Voight?

25:06.120 --> 25:07.587
Shouldn't you be?

25:07.622 --> 25:09.990
I'm saying he's got all kinds of
reasons for doing what he does.

25:10.026 --> 25:12.761
But if he's got that car assigned to some

25:12.796 --> 25:15.698
off-the-books whatever the hell it is?

25:15.734 --> 25:18.836
You know what I'm saying.

25:18.871 --> 25:20.705
Yeah.

25:20.741 --> 25:22.340
Yeah...

25:22.376 --> 25:24.777
You left your scrunchie
in my car last night.

25:27.383 --> 25:30.485
Yes, I did.

25:30.520 --> 25:32.054
Okay, what do we got?

25:32.089 --> 25:35.759
Madison Turner is actually
Jamie Lynn Stevens.

25:35.794 --> 25:38.129
She was arrested in 2008
on solicitation charges,

25:38.164 --> 25:39.631
and then she went missing in 2009.

25:39.666 --> 25:41.366
Who filed the missing persons report?

25:41.501 --> 25:44.404
Her mom. Then a year later she
overdosed and the case ran cold.

25:44.439 --> 25:47.609
Hey, boss, we've been going
through Stommer's call logs.

25:47.644 --> 25:50.446
His clients, wife, all check out
except for one short phone call

25:50.481 --> 25:53.950
made three weeks ago
at 2:32 a.m. on March 7

25:53.986 --> 25:55.152
to a residence in Naperville

25:55.187 --> 25:57.588
owned by a woman named Marcia Harris.

25:57.624 --> 25:59.258
Yeah, call outgoing from his cell phone.

25:59.373 --> 26:01.040
Call lasted two minutes.

26:01.076 --> 26:02.775
Marcia has no connection with Stommer.

26:02.811 --> 26:04.845
What she does have is
an 18-year-old daughter

26:04.881 --> 26:06.214
who was popped for solicitation

26:06.250 --> 26:08.651
in the exact same place
where Ruby was kidnapped.

26:08.686 --> 26:10.753
I'll drive.

26:10.788 --> 26:11.955
- Hank?
- Yeah.

26:11.991 --> 26:13.156
We need to talk.

26:13.192 --> 26:15.093
Actually, Sergeant, we do too.

26:15.128 --> 26:17.129
Counselor.

26:22.205 --> 26:24.973
You want to know the
toughest part of my job?

26:25.009 --> 26:26.742
Knowing somebody's
guilty, and not being able

26:26.777 --> 26:28.177
to do a damn thing about it.

26:28.213 --> 26:29.914
Steve, we're still building a case.

26:29.949 --> 26:31.315
So far, you've brought me a witness

26:31.350 --> 26:33.752
who won't identify herself as a victim.

26:33.787 --> 26:35.186
Without a victim, I don't have a crime.

26:35.223 --> 26:36.622
Actually, we brought you two,

26:36.658 --> 26:38.492
one who's pregnant
with this psycho's baby.

26:38.527 --> 26:41.496
Look, we're on the same side.

26:41.531 --> 26:43.766
Reality is, proving
rape against prostitutes

26:43.801 --> 26:45.936
is just shy of impossible.

26:45.971 --> 26:48.138
Throw in her criminal
history and her drug abuse,

26:48.173 --> 26:49.574
she doesn't stand a chance.

26:49.609 --> 26:51.810
Just put her in front of a
grand jury, let them decide.

26:51.845 --> 26:54.213
It's her word against his.
There's no physical evidence,

26:54.249 --> 26:57.785
and everyone involved is over 18.

26:57.820 --> 27:00.255
You have to kick Drew Stommer.

27:00.290 --> 27:01.423
That girl in the hospital,

27:01.458 --> 27:02.892
she carved her name in her own forearm

27:02.927 --> 27:05.295
so she wouldn't forget who she was.

27:05.331 --> 27:06.563
That's what this guy's capable of.

27:06.599 --> 27:08.433
All the more reason

27:08.468 --> 27:11.103
not to press charges on specious evidence.

27:11.138 --> 27:14.074
Bring me something I can prosecute.

27:22.324 --> 27:24.392
That picture's from a different time.

27:24.428 --> 27:27.964
Like I said, I haven't
seen Jennifer for a while.

27:27.999 --> 27:29.700
Can you be more specific?

27:29.735 --> 27:31.134
It's been a year.

27:31.170 --> 27:34.506
Jennifer is an addict.
Started stealing for dope.

27:34.542 --> 27:35.975
Finally kicked her out when she pawned

27:36.010 --> 27:37.811
her own grandmother's jewelry.

27:37.846 --> 27:39.079
When's the last time you talked to her?

27:39.114 --> 27:40.948
I honestly don't remember.

27:40.984 --> 27:44.854
Was it March 7th at 2:33 a.m.?

27:44.890 --> 27:46.222
Maybe.

27:46.258 --> 27:48.292
She called a few weeks ago.

27:48.327 --> 27:51.563
I was sleeping. I didn't
recognize the number.

27:51.598 --> 27:53.799
What did she say exactly?

27:53.835 --> 27:57.471
She, um, said she was with some guy,

27:57.506 --> 28:01.677
just had a bad feeling
about him, that was it.

28:01.712 --> 28:03.980
Did something happen to Jennifer?

28:05.217 --> 28:07.652
Thanks for your time.

28:09.957 --> 28:11.758
So Jennifer realized what was going on,

28:11.793 --> 28:14.495
grabbed Stommer's phone, called for help.

28:20.271 --> 28:22.372
Stommer's got another girl out there.

28:25.512 --> 28:28.881
Jennifer Harris. 19 years old.

28:28.916 --> 28:31.651
History of drug problems.
Fits Stommer's MO.

28:31.687 --> 28:33.120
Mother couldn't give us much.

28:33.156 --> 28:35.222
Jennifer's been out of the
house a year, no fixed address.

28:35.258 --> 28:36.591
She got herself together enough

28:36.627 --> 28:39.228
to get on public assistance,
has a Link card that's active

28:39.264 --> 28:42.266
and purchased $13 worth
of groceries on March 6.

28:42.381 --> 28:43.982
Damn, March 6th?

28:44.017 --> 28:45.050
Day before she called her mom.

28:45.085 --> 28:46.419
Yeah, nothing after that.

28:46.454 --> 28:49.122
All right, get a warrant
for this real estate office.

28:49.158 --> 28:51.759
We're gonna hit every
property Stommer represents.

28:51.795 --> 28:53.194
This girl could be out there locked up,

28:53.229 --> 28:55.197
starving, we don't know what.

28:55.232 --> 28:57.500
I want to try something else.

29:08.150 --> 29:09.149
Half day?

29:09.185 --> 29:11.252
You know I called a lawyer, right?

29:11.288 --> 29:13.255
He's not here now.

29:15.159 --> 29:17.894
Hands behind your back.

29:20.366 --> 29:21.667
Take a little ride.

29:25.140 --> 29:26.140
You're out of your mind if you think

29:26.175 --> 29:27.141
you're getting away with this.

29:50.075 --> 29:53.144
Get up.

29:53.179 --> 29:54.578
They can't just drag
us out here like this.

29:54.614 --> 29:55.747
We didn't do anything.

29:55.782 --> 29:57.149
Madison, look at me.

29:57.184 --> 29:59.385
Do not listen to them.
We're gonna get through this.

29:59.420 --> 30:01.455
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

30:01.490 --> 30:03.791
- No!
- Ruby, no!

30:03.827 --> 30:05.493
That is Ruby Baker.

30:05.529 --> 30:09.900
Your husband kidnapped her eight weeks ago

30:09.935 --> 30:13.571
and held her in a basement and
raped her to get her pregnant.

30:13.666 --> 30:14.900
No, honey, remember what we talked about.

30:14.935 --> 30:16.468
Everything they say is a lie.

30:16.503 --> 30:19.573
We're gonna tie you to
all three abductions.

30:19.609 --> 30:21.508
This is the last free
air you're gonna breathe.

30:21.544 --> 30:23.478
Hey, we need your help.

30:23.513 --> 30:25.548
He's holding another girl.
We don't know where she is.

30:25.683 --> 30:27.417
It's the truth.

30:27.453 --> 30:29.453
Another girl like Ruby.

30:29.488 --> 30:32.390
He took her and he hid her for one reason:

30:32.425 --> 30:34.693
to give you the family
that you always wanted.

30:34.729 --> 30:36.696
Your husband raped me!

30:36.732 --> 30:39.300
Every night until I forgot
how long I was down there!

30:39.335 --> 30:40.468
They are trying to tear us apart.

30:40.503 --> 30:41.603
We did nothing wrong.

30:41.638 --> 30:43.271
We're just trying to start a family!

30:43.307 --> 30:45.475
Like you always wanted!

30:45.510 --> 30:49.114
Madison, I think you knew what
was going on the whole time.

30:49.149 --> 30:51.884
You might have had your eyes closed.

30:51.919 --> 30:53.686
This is what it looks like.

30:53.721 --> 30:55.622
- No, I didn't know!
-  Madison, listen to me...

30:55.657 --> 30:57.392
- Shut up!
- Madison!

30:57.427 --> 30:58.526
- Look at me!
- Madison!

30:58.561 --> 31:00.462
Your name is Jamie Lynn Stevens.

31:00.498 --> 31:02.332
You grew up outside of Rockford, Illinois.

31:02.367 --> 31:03.566
No.

31:03.602 --> 31:05.736
Your little sister's name is Caitlin.

31:05.772 --> 31:08.774
Caitlin is 25 years
old now. She's married.

31:08.809 --> 31:10.810
- She had a baby girl.
- Madison, look at me!

31:10.845 --> 31:12.645
She named her baby Jamie Lynn.

31:12.680 --> 31:14.114
Look at me, Madison!

31:14.150 --> 31:15.417
It's okay.

31:15.452 --> 31:18.087
I know that you know what
the right thing to do is.

31:18.122 --> 31:19.755
I can tell that you're a good person.

31:19.791 --> 31:22.325
I know that you want to
help us. I can see it.

31:22.361 --> 31:26.298
Please, you are our only
chance at finding this girl.

31:39.718 --> 31:41.318
Guy said the real estate agent hired them

31:41.353 --> 31:42.720
to lay floor in the basement.

31:42.756 --> 31:43.788
- Keep 'em here.
- Yeah.

31:48.030 --> 31:49.996
Down here!

32:02.850 --> 32:04.884
I got dirt.

32:04.919 --> 32:06.153
I got something. We got something.

32:06.188 --> 32:07.754
Got something right here.

32:07.790 --> 32:09.791
There it is.

32:20.307 --> 32:22.308
Is she breathing?

32:28.919 --> 32:30.920
Let's get her out.

32:39.462 --> 32:42.565
I read about this place. The black site.

32:42.600 --> 32:45.001
News said it's where you go
before you're read your rights.

32:46.339 --> 32:48.339
I see there's no cameras,
so let me be clear:

32:48.374 --> 32:52.178
You touch me, and that is a
seven-figure lawsuit that I win.

32:52.214 --> 32:54.548
We found her.

32:54.584 --> 32:56.785
Jennifer.

32:56.820 --> 33:00.990
You beat her, and you strangled her.

33:01.025 --> 33:04.061
Once he realized Ruby was pregnant,

33:04.096 --> 33:06.765
had no use for Jennifer.

33:06.800 --> 33:09.034
You have no proof of any of this.

33:09.070 --> 33:10.604
We got your prints,

33:10.639 --> 33:14.442
GPS history.

33:14.477 --> 33:17.346
We can put you at that house.

33:17.381 --> 33:19.482
Jamie Lynn's giving
her statement right now.

33:19.518 --> 33:21.185
She has the right to an attorney.

33:21.220 --> 33:22.419
She waived it.

33:25.325 --> 33:29.463
There any other victims out there...

33:29.498 --> 33:32.433
now might be the time to tell us.

33:35.840 --> 33:38.308
I would like to speak to my attorney.

33:47.623 --> 33:51.693
You know, after 26 years, I've seen

33:51.728 --> 33:55.231
just about every horror
people can do to each other.

33:55.266 --> 33:57.100
I don't know.

33:57.136 --> 34:00.038
I mean, all this time I thought if I...

34:00.073 --> 34:04.945
put enough guys like you away...

34:04.980 --> 34:06.914
the streets would be a safer place.

34:24.373 --> 34:29.245
And you're right, there's
no cameras down here.

34:29.280 --> 34:32.248
So it's your word against mine.

34:35.221 --> 34:38.257
You grabbed for my sidearm.

34:38.293 --> 34:40.059
He can't do this.

34:40.094 --> 34:42.129
And yet.

34:45.034 --> 34:47.003
- Take the gun.
- Stop.

34:49.507 --> 34:52.243
Come on. Grab for the gun.

34:52.279 --> 34:54.280
Help!

34:54.315 --> 34:56.014
- Reach for it.
- Help, someone!

34:56.050 --> 34:58.351
- Help me!
- Reach for the gun.

34:58.387 --> 34:59.754
Help, someone!

34:59.789 --> 35:01.622
Someone help! Okay, please.

35:02.793 --> 35:05.061
Please, please.

35:05.096 --> 35:07.196
Please.

35:07.232 --> 35:09.066
You smell that?

35:09.101 --> 35:12.203
That's the smell of fear.

35:12.239 --> 35:13.739
- Please?
- Yeah.

35:13.775 --> 35:15.509
Please!

35:15.544 --> 35:17.444
Please! Please!

35:17.479 --> 35:19.113
Please!

35:19.149 --> 35:21.717
Please.

35:21.752 --> 35:23.720
Please?

35:25.424 --> 35:27.358
Please.

35:27.393 --> 35:30.829
Now you know what it's
like to beg for your life.

35:30.864 --> 35:32.765
Please.

35:39.209 --> 35:40.710
Please.

35:51.059 --> 35:54.895
He was everything to me.

35:54.931 --> 35:57.332
Now I have nothing.

36:00.305 --> 36:02.873
You, um... you have your life back.

36:07.949 --> 36:10.050
And I think you're a very brave woman.

36:27.877 --> 36:32.948
Sergeant, this inventory
thing Platt's got me doing...

36:32.984 --> 36:35.418
we seem to be missing a maroon Jeep.

36:35.453 --> 36:38.088
Seized on a narcotics bust?

36:54.747 --> 36:57.348
I know it was rough today.

36:57.384 --> 37:00.486
What you guys did makes us
all proud to be part of 21.

37:11.103 --> 37:13.003
So what are you gonna do?

37:13.039 --> 37:15.372
About the baby?

37:15.408 --> 37:17.576
About everything.

37:17.611 --> 37:19.779
Think I want to keep it.

37:19.814 --> 37:23.818
I just... I want one good
thing to come from this.

37:30.496 --> 37:34.566
You know, I was shot,

37:34.602 --> 37:37.704
the day I found out my wife
was pregnant with our daughter.

37:39.474 --> 37:42.444
I was wearing a vest, and...

37:44.014 --> 37:45.982
I blacked out.

37:47.987 --> 37:52.157
Patrolman found me, gave me this.

37:54.061 --> 37:55.461
It's yours now.

38:00.303 --> 38:04.374
- The bullet?
- Yeah.

38:04.409 --> 38:06.610
The one that didn't kill me.

38:11.418 --> 38:16.356
You know, you remind me of my dad.

38:24.102 --> 38:25.836
Here, just call this number, okay?

38:25.872 --> 38:28.207
- Thank you.
- Hey.

38:28.242 --> 38:31.844
So you know, no one calls
them "scrunchies" anymore.

38:31.880 --> 38:33.747
Why not? They're scrunchy.

38:35.284 --> 38:37.152
- True.
- Ruzek. Laptop.

38:39.724 --> 38:41.325
- Seriously?
- Hey, I heard about

38:41.360 --> 38:42.793
a copper getting stripped for six years

38:42.828 --> 38:44.763
over a stolen burner phone,
so, yeah, I'm serious.

38:44.898 --> 38:47.733
You know what? You know what I think?

38:47.768 --> 38:49.236
I don't think this has
anything to do with the laptop.

38:49.271 --> 38:50.604
I think it's about her.

38:50.639 --> 38:53.274
You want to bust my balls,
look like a tough guy, right?

38:53.309 --> 38:54.876
- Adam.
- No.

38:54.912 --> 38:57.046
You must see what's happening here.

38:57.082 --> 38:58.214
I'm not making it up.

38:58.290 --> 38:59.790
Dude's obviously into you.

38:59.826 --> 39:03.361
So you know what? You want to date her?

39:03.397 --> 39:04.463
Be my guest.

39:04.498 --> 39:06.365
Just get the stupid laptop, Adam.

39:11.875 --> 39:14.777
Hey, look.

39:14.812 --> 39:16.279
I'm sorry you got dragged into all this.

39:16.315 --> 39:19.750
I just... I... honestly I just
wanted to get the laptop back...

39:31.301 --> 39:34.170
Ruzek and Burgess.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.673
And Roman.

39:36.709 --> 39:38.443
That sounds like a
horror movie right there.

39:38.478 --> 39:41.614
It'll probably be a PG-13 deal.

39:41.649 --> 39:43.850
Nobody's gonna kill anybody.

39:43.886 --> 39:45.820
Hey, shots on the house.

39:45.855 --> 39:49.057
Just something that I created
in honor of Mouch and Platt.

39:49.093 --> 39:51.294
Two great tastes that
taste great together.

39:51.329 --> 39:53.531
Hermann, thanks.

39:57.638 --> 39:59.972
Unlike gin and scotch.

40:00.008 --> 40:01.675
Why would you do that to somebody?

40:01.710 --> 40:03.544
I don't know. Stupid.

40:05.949 --> 40:07.283
That's disgusting.

40:08.352 --> 40:11.621
All right, what else?

40:11.658 --> 40:16.428
Burgess did ask me for
advice about dating a partner.

40:16.463 --> 40:20.201
Yeah? What did you tell her?

40:20.236 --> 40:22.971
You know, just...

40:23.006 --> 40:26.008
That there is one thing
that's really hard.

40:26.044 --> 40:28.045
What's that?

40:30.550 --> 40:33.219
Hey, you can tell me.

40:35.056 --> 40:37.891
It's just that, you know,
when you work together all day

40:37.926 --> 40:41.430
and you got to be professional,

40:41.465 --> 40:43.933
and you can't...

40:43.969 --> 40:48.372
tell him that...

40:48.407 --> 40:52.311
you bought a new outfit and
it's sitting in the apartment,

40:52.347 --> 40:54.948
still in the box.

40:58.321 --> 41:00.823
Okay, we're out of here. We got to go.

41:01.305 --> 41:07.779
