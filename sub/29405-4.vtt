00:01.369 --> 00:03.071
ANNOUNCER: Everyday heroes
doing extraordinary things.

00:03.104 --> 00:04.072
9-1-1 returns.

00:04.105 --> 00:05.239
We're gonna find you.

00:05.273 --> 00:07.141
ANNOUNCER: Catch
all-new episodes Mondays

00:07.175 --> 00:09.143
and check out
our other Fox programs.

00:09.177 --> 00:11.679
Prodigal Son, Almost Family
and  The Resident.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.381
There's more to the story
than you know.

00:13.414 --> 00:14.948
Only on Fox.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.553
(intense music)

00:19.587 --> 00:23.424
(sirens wailing)

00:23.457 --> 00:26.360
-(truck honking)
-(tires squealing)

00:28.962 --> 00:31.599
MAN: Everyone,
please keep moving

00:31.632 --> 00:33.701
to the designated
safe area.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.836
(fire alarm ringing)

00:35.869 --> 00:38.572
*

00:38.606 --> 00:41.775
My God, that's the biggest
damn fire I've never seen.

00:41.809 --> 00:44.945
*

00:44.978 --> 00:47.348
I hate fire drills.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.850
City mandates we do 'em
every three years.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.119
Can't fight city hall.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.686
BOBBY: First alarm
was triggered at 12:20.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.288
Call came in
30 seconds later.

00:54.322 --> 00:56.957
Boots down, hoses out
by 12:43.

00:56.990 --> 00:58.359
That's what?

00:58.392 --> 01:00.060
Four minutes over
our allotted response time.

01:00.094 --> 01:01.795
Ouch, that's gonna
cost us some points.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.131
HEN: Somebody's gonna
have to explain

01:03.164 --> 01:05.433
that to the new fire marshal.

01:07.801 --> 01:08.802
BOBBY: There was a stalled bus

01:08.836 --> 01:10.571
blocking both directions
on Grand.

01:10.604 --> 01:13.274
Vehicles couldn't clear a path,
which delayed our arrival.

01:13.307 --> 01:15.243
And yet the 144

01:15.276 --> 01:19.480
managed a response time
in under six minutes.

01:19.513 --> 01:22.383
That's a full 17 minutes
ahead of the 118.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.218
The 144 is five block away.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.919
I hear you, Bobby,
I do,

01:25.953 --> 01:27.588
and--and--and
I wanna help.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.923
I gotta be impartial here,
you know?

01:29.957 --> 01:31.825
Look, if I'm gonna do
this kind of light duty,

01:31.859 --> 01:34.995
I gotta take it seriously,
gotta be strictly by the book,

01:35.028 --> 01:36.464
just how you would
want me to be.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.731
For what it's worth,
I'm proud of you.

01:37.765 --> 01:38.799
I'm glad you didn't
throw away your career

01:38.832 --> 01:40.434
just 'cause you had
a little setback.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.236
I learned one thing
from that tsunami:

01:42.270 --> 01:45.173
it's that I don't quit.
I fight.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.740
I'm gonna
keep on fighting

01:46.774 --> 01:48.342
until I get back
to where I belong:

01:48.376 --> 01:51.479
with my team putting
out fake fires like this one.

01:51.512 --> 01:54.482
You're enjoying this
way too much.

01:54.515 --> 01:57.851
Be careful not to logjam
at the stairwells.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.620
I have to--
oh.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.855
MAN: Why do they always
do these things during lunch?

02:01.889 --> 02:03.491
My carbonara's
gonna turn to mush.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.926
(chuckles)
I don't know.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.295
You okay?

02:08.329 --> 02:09.630
It's not a real fire.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.834
You expecting paparazzi?

02:15.536 --> 02:17.371
This is a fake fire.
Why can't we use a fake hose?

02:17.405 --> 02:18.839
Hey, Buck, how we doing?

02:18.872 --> 02:20.808
You don't wanna know.

02:20.841 --> 02:25.513
(loud explosions)

02:25.546 --> 02:28.015
(ominous music)

02:28.048 --> 02:29.650
(music swells)

02:29.683 --> 02:31.051
Alan?

02:31.084 --> 02:32.986
Think Alan's
having a seizure.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.021
Oh!

02:34.054 --> 02:37.024
(intense music)

02:37.057 --> 02:43.431
*

02:45.499 --> 02:47.535
(people gasping and moaning)

02:47.568 --> 02:51.372
MAN: All right,
let's get you up first.

02:51.405 --> 02:54.742
(quirky bass music)

02:54.775 --> 02:56.310
HEN: These things
are unpredictable.

02:56.344 --> 02:57.978
Epileptic seizures
could be triggered

02:58.011 --> 03:00.381
by strobing lights,
even sounds.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.082
ALAN: I'm just so embarrassed.

03:02.115 --> 03:03.217
HEN: No need to be.

03:03.251 --> 03:04.718
The event seems over.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.720
Just to be safe, we're gonna
get you to the hospital, okay?

03:06.754 --> 03:08.489
-Thanks.
-CHASE: Hey, there.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.991
Chase Mackey, tenth floor,
Mackey, Gaskin & Whitmore.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.393
I want you to know
I saw everything

03:12.426 --> 03:13.894
and I have reason
to believe this building

03:13.927 --> 03:15.162
is not in compliance

03:15.195 --> 03:16.830
with the Americans
with Disabilities Act.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.032
There's several legal options
you might wish to consider.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.268
-HEN: Sir?
-CHASE: Hmm?

03:20.301 --> 03:22.102
You might wanna wait until
they're in the ambulance

03:22.135 --> 03:23.404
before you start chasing it.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.839
Okay.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.040
BUCK: Well,
it's a good thing

03:27.074 --> 03:28.942
this wasn't an actual
five-alarm fire.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.110
Yeah, that is
a good thing.

03:30.143 --> 03:31.779
Probably doesn't help
that you're a man down.

03:31.812 --> 03:34.382
You know, I will be sure
to mention that in my report.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.816
Thanks.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.453
No problem.

03:39.487 --> 03:42.456
-(phone buttons beep)
-(siren whirs)

03:42.490 --> 03:43.857
You've had it
twice as long as me.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.225
It's not even
your game.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.461
HEN: Denny,
let Harry have a turn.

03:47.495 --> 03:48.796
Why can't he play
with his own stuff?

03:48.829 --> 03:50.063
Cut it out.

03:50.097 --> 03:53.367
Play nice,
or I'll take the game away.

03:53.401 --> 03:55.436
KAREN: We have
one more round of tests,

03:55.469 --> 03:59.106
and then we do the trigger shot
to induce ovulation.

03:59.139 --> 04:02.075
36 hours later, we go in
for the egg retrieval.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.944
Doctor's hoping
to grab 15.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.579
15 eggs?

04:05.613 --> 04:06.747
(chuckles)

04:06.780 --> 04:08.148
I thought you two
wanted a baby,

04:08.181 --> 04:09.483
not a baseball team.

04:09.517 --> 04:11.218
(laughter)

04:11.251 --> 04:15.789
No, we're expected to lose half
at every stage of the process,

04:15.823 --> 04:18.591
so we start with 15
in the hopes

04:18.625 --> 04:21.329
of getting
2 or 3 viable embryos.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.397
Oh, oh, okay.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.499
Well, I've always
been an overachiever,

04:25.533 --> 04:27.335
so my money's
on the baseball team.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.002
(laughter)

04:29.036 --> 04:30.270
-DENNY: Give it back!
-HARRY: It's my turn!

04:30.304 --> 04:31.905
-DENNY: It's my game!
-HARRY: It's my house!

04:31.939 --> 04:32.973
-DENNY: Give it back!
-HARRY: It's my turn!

04:33.006 --> 04:34.775
-ATHENA: Kids!
-(gasps)

04:37.277 --> 04:38.446
(slurps)

04:39.613 --> 04:40.681
(laughs)

04:40.714 --> 04:42.350
You need to teach us
how to do that.

04:42.383 --> 04:45.085
(laughter)

04:45.118 --> 04:47.688
What if Denny doesn't like
having a sibling?

04:47.721 --> 04:49.757
What's not to like?

04:49.790 --> 04:51.191
Kids are better
with siblings.

04:51.224 --> 04:52.460
It makes them
better people.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.794
Wait a minute.
(scoffs)

04:53.827 --> 04:55.696
Both Athena and I
are only children,

04:55.729 --> 04:57.297
and we turned out
just fine.

04:57.331 --> 04:59.299
Yes, you are both
wonderful adults,

04:59.333 --> 05:04.004
but I just--I don't know who
I'd be without my brothers.

05:04.037 --> 05:07.107
They made me kinder,
more understanding,

05:07.140 --> 05:08.476
more willing to share.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.210
Yeah, well, our little one

05:10.243 --> 05:13.847
is struggling with the concept
of "sharing is caring."

05:13.881 --> 05:16.984
What if they're at each other's
throats all the time?

05:17.017 --> 05:18.719
ATHENA:
Oh, they will be.

05:18.752 --> 05:22.556
Mm-hmm, May, she loved
having a baby brother,

05:22.590 --> 05:24.224
right up till that part
where he started

05:24.257 --> 05:27.194
walking and talking
and getting into all her stuff.

05:27.227 --> 05:28.629
(chuckles)

05:28.662 --> 05:31.632
Oh, I'm not sure
we considered that part.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.134
Our family's not just growing;
it's changing.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.904
It'll be an adjustment,

05:36.937 --> 05:39.172
but you two
will do just fine.

05:39.206 --> 05:42.009
Denny'll love having a brother

05:42.042 --> 05:43.477
eventually.

05:43.511 --> 05:44.978
(laughter)

05:45.012 --> 05:47.981
CHIMNEY: Your brother
is driving me crazy.

05:48.015 --> 05:48.982
You weren't there.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.183
Okay, he was enjoying it.

05:50.217 --> 05:51.519
I never seen a man
make check marks

05:51.552 --> 05:53.387
with such enthusiasm.

05:53.421 --> 05:55.689
Give a guy a little power,
he goes mad.

05:55.723 --> 05:58.659
Hmm, said the pot
about the kettle.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.762
Hey, Captain Chimney
is safely behind us.

06:01.795 --> 06:02.896
I'm a wiser kettle now.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.733
Actually, you were the pot
in that scenario.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.168
(plate shatters)

06:08.201 --> 06:09.537
(ominous music)

06:09.570 --> 06:10.538
-Hey.
-(gasps)

06:10.571 --> 06:11.672
Oh!

06:11.705 --> 06:13.073
-What's wrong?
-Nothing, I'm fine.

06:13.106 --> 06:16.109
I--I just, um--
I'm so sorry.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.211
No, no, no, just leave it.
I'll grab a broom.

06:18.245 --> 06:19.847
No, I got it, okay?

06:19.880 --> 06:21.449
I just--I--I didn't
realize, um--

06:21.482 --> 06:22.916
Maddie, are you okay?

06:22.950 --> 06:24.552
I didn't realize how--

06:24.585 --> 06:26.053
that--I didn't realize
that it's late,

06:26.086 --> 06:28.355
and--and so I should--
I should go.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.390
(door slams)

06:30.424 --> 06:32.926
CHIMNEY: Really wasn't
sure what to say after that.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.428
"Hey, Maddie,
you know I'm nothing

06:34.462 --> 06:36.564
"like your psycho
ex-husband, right?

06:36.597 --> 06:39.800
I'm not the kind of guy
you need to be afraid of."

06:39.833 --> 06:41.034
Because she was.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.437
I mean, it was just
for a second, but...

06:43.471 --> 06:45.439
she looked scared.

06:45.473 --> 06:46.874
Not really sure
what to do with that.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.375
(yawns)

06:48.408 --> 06:51.445
Oh, I'm sorry,
is my crisis boring you?

06:51.479 --> 06:54.815
Sorry, uh, didn't get
much sleep last night.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.617
Christopher's
been having nightmares

06:56.650 --> 06:58.552
ever since the tsunami.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.753
He and half the city.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.221
That's gotta be expected,
though, right?

07:01.254 --> 07:03.290
Ah, he's waking up
screaming and crying.

07:03.323 --> 07:06.760
Tried talking to him about it,
but he won't open up to me.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.161
Says he's fine.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.631
Yeah, lot of that
going around.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.766
HEN: Careful, guys.
Hall monitor's here.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.834
BUCK: You guys paint?

07:13.867 --> 07:16.136
Why does the place
look smaller?

07:16.169 --> 07:17.605
I think your head
just got bigger.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.106
(all chuckle)

07:19.139 --> 07:20.641
BOBBY:
So Fire Marshal Buck

07:20.674 --> 07:22.676
decides to drop off
his report in person.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.311
Is that a sign
of maturity?

07:24.344 --> 07:27.314
Or is it just revenge for all
the times I've written you up?

07:27.347 --> 07:29.249
Actually, uh,
you passed.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.652
I bumped up the numbers,
got fancy with the math.

07:31.685 --> 07:32.820
You don't know math.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.321
Which will be my excuse

07:34.354 --> 07:36.023
if anybody
calls me out on it.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.357
Uh, speaking of,

07:37.390 --> 07:39.259
did any of you guys
get a call from that lawyer?

07:39.292 --> 07:40.661
The ambulance chaser?

07:40.694 --> 07:43.497
He wants to talk to me
about the building violations.

07:43.531 --> 07:44.998
Think somebody
might be suing them.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.000
Yeah, he was
passing out cards like candy.

07:47.034 --> 07:49.102
LENA: Hey, Diaz,
I need a spot over here.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.037
Got you.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.805
Hey, good to see you, man.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.140
Uh, who--who's that?

07:53.173 --> 07:55.008
What?

07:57.477 --> 07:59.346
Her name is Lena Bosko.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.348
Her station was smack in
the middle of the impact zone

08:01.381 --> 08:02.950
and her crew
was temporarily reassigned,

08:02.983 --> 08:03.884
so I brought her
over here.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.319
-You replaced me?
-What? No.

08:06.353 --> 08:08.556
Then what's that
right there?

08:11.358 --> 08:12.560
Buck, relax.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.562
I promise you your place
will still be here for you

08:14.595 --> 08:15.629
when you're ready.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.531
Cap, I'm ready now.

08:17.565 --> 08:19.633
-Buck, listen to me--
-(fire alarm rings)

08:19.667 --> 08:21.501
We will talk soon.

08:21.535 --> 08:24.037
(fire alarm ringing)

08:27.274 --> 08:28.742
-(doors slam)
-(engine turns over)

08:28.776 --> 08:31.745
(sirens wailing)

08:31.779 --> 08:34.748
(somber music)

08:34.782 --> 08:41.688
*

08:47.595 --> 08:49.329
CHRISTOPHER (echoing):
Dad!

08:49.362 --> 08:50.330
(ominous music)

08:50.363 --> 08:51.531
Christopher.

08:51.565 --> 08:52.833
*

08:52.866 --> 08:54.201
CHRISTOPHER: She was drowning.
She was drowning.

08:54.234 --> 08:57.070
She was drowning.
She was drowning.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.739
She was drowning.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.507
-EDDIE: Hey.
-(gasping)

09:00.540 --> 09:02.342
She was drowning.
She was drowning.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.012
Oh, it's okay, buddy.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.714
I'm here.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.616
It was just a dream.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.684
It's just a dream.

09:10.718 --> 09:11.919
You're safe.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.954
(ominous musical sting)

09:13.987 --> 09:15.422
Has he talked about
the tsunami at all?

09:15.455 --> 09:18.025
I'm still not sure
what he saw that day.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.093
We're getting there.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.429
Christopher talked about
being at the pier with Buck,

09:22.462 --> 09:23.563
how they played games.

09:23.597 --> 09:24.564
That part isn't the reason

09:24.598 --> 09:27.134
he's waking up
every night screaming.

09:27.167 --> 09:30.604
His subconscious is still
processing the trauma.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.305
He's working his way
through it.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.307
I know it's hard.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.476
You love your son.
You wanna fix this.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.378
But it'll take some time.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.347
Just wish he'd talk
to me about it.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.619
Maybe he's trying
to communicate in other ways.

09:51.491 --> 09:54.995
(tender piano music)

09:55.028 --> 10:00.333
*

10:00.367 --> 10:01.935
A drowning woman.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.938
Yes, he does seem
to be fixated on her.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.140
Lot of people
died in that tsunami.

10:08.942 --> 10:12.345
I know Buck tried to shield
Chris from most of it, but--

10:12.379 --> 10:14.514
I'm sure your friend
did the best he could.

10:14.547 --> 10:16.116
They were separated
a long time.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.651
Who knows
what else he saw.

10:17.685 --> 10:20.320
Or who this
drowning woman was.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.022
He'll tell us
when he's ready.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.524
In fact,
if the opportunity's right,

10:24.557 --> 10:25.859
he might tell you first.

10:27.961 --> 10:31.631
Is there anything I can
do until then?

10:33.166 --> 10:35.468
Just keep loving him.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.206
(computer beeps)

10:47.247 --> 10:48.982
911, are you there?

10:49.016 --> 10:50.550
WOMAN: I--I'm--I'm here.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.652
(ominous music)

10:52.686 --> 10:53.954
Ma'am, are you all right?

10:53.987 --> 10:56.323
WOMAN: I hear a--

10:56.356 --> 10:58.692
(shakily) I think--
I think I might need--

10:58.726 --> 11:00.060
Are you injured?

11:00.093 --> 11:02.662
WOMAN: No, no, not--
not really. I just--

11:02.696 --> 11:04.998
MAN: Hey, who the hell
you on the phone with?

11:05.032 --> 11:07.634
WOMAN: I'm sorry,
you've got the wrong number.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.236
(phone clicks)

11:09.269 --> 11:10.738
(sighs)

11:12.105 --> 11:14.341
(tense music)

11:14.374 --> 11:17.377
(computer beeping)

11:17.410 --> 11:21.915
*

11:21.949 --> 11:23.583
(keyboard clacking)

11:23.616 --> 11:25.385
*

11:25.418 --> 11:26.920
(computer beeping)

11:26.954 --> 11:28.055
(line trilling)

11:28.088 --> 11:29.422
MAN: Hello?

11:29.456 --> 11:33.160
(pulsing tense music)

11:33.193 --> 11:34.161
MAN (angrily):
Hello, who is this?

11:34.194 --> 11:35.595
Uh, good morning, sir.

11:35.628 --> 11:38.565
I'm calling to inform you
that starting as low as $49.95,

11:38.598 --> 11:40.700
-our cleaning service--
-MAN: We're not interested.

11:40.734 --> 11:43.403
Take us off your list,
and don't call back.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.538
(computer beeps)

11:45.572 --> 11:48.541
(dramatic music)

11:48.575 --> 11:49.943
*

11:49.977 --> 11:51.111
(pounds desk)

11:51.144 --> 11:53.346
Multiple calls,
multiple hang ups.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.248
Now, according
to the call logs,

11:55.282 --> 11:57.717
no one ever said anything.

11:57.751 --> 12:00.053
She never said anything
until today,

12:00.087 --> 12:01.855
and I think that she was
about to ask for help

12:01.889 --> 12:03.223
but he came back.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.125
Okay, we'll send someone out,
do a welfare check.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.227
No, that'll make
everything worse.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.364
(sighs) Look,
I know that you think

12:11.398 --> 12:14.935
this is triggering
something personal for me,

12:14.968 --> 12:19.139
and...maybe it is.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.440
But it doesn't mean
that I'm wrong.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.042
I don't think
you're wrong.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.077
You identify with her.
You want to help her.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.578
I get it.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.680
But if she's not ready
to accept that help...

12:29.249 --> 12:30.650
Yeah, there's
nothing we can do.

12:30.683 --> 12:32.552
Been doing this
eight years.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.087
I wish I knew
the magic words

12:34.121 --> 12:36.423
to make someone realize
they can get out.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.160
Still haven't found 'em.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.762
But maybe they just
don't work over the phone.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.336
911,
what's your emergency?

12:51.104 --> 12:52.339
CHASE:
So we could agree

12:52.372 --> 12:54.241
there was some negligence
during this fire drill.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.676
(scoffs) Nah, I wouldn't
agree with that, no.

12:56.709 --> 12:59.479
Your after-action report
says the LAFD

12:59.512 --> 13:04.084
exceeded the evacuation time
requirement by 12 minutes.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.685
That's actually
a pretty decent time

13:05.718 --> 13:08.455
for clearing
a 35-story building.

13:08.488 --> 13:12.259
Look, all your questions seem
to be about the department.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.261
I thought your client
was suing the building.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.595
Clients,

13:15.628 --> 13:18.298
42 injured people
the LAFD failed to protect.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.699
This is a class action
against the city

13:19.732 --> 13:21.034
on all of their behalfs.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.669
You're suing the city?

13:22.702 --> 13:24.304
Mm-hmm.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.973
And you think I'm gonna
help you with that?

13:26.006 --> 13:29.542
I find disgruntled employees
often make the best witnesses.

13:29.576 --> 13:32.512
Uh, I'm--I'm not
disgruntled.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.282
I looked into you.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.384
I know about the accident,

13:37.417 --> 13:38.785
how you've been fighting
with the LAFD

13:38.818 --> 13:40.820
to return to full duty
because of the blood thinners.

13:40.854 --> 13:44.457
They're just trying
to protect the department.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.359
And who's protecting you?

13:48.996 --> 13:51.064
Yeah, I can take care
of myself.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.367
Watch.

13:55.568 --> 13:58.838
You know, the city that
you're trying to make look bad

13:58.872 --> 14:00.440
is not some corporation.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.743
Those city employees,

14:03.776 --> 14:07.580
those firefighters
that you can't wait to smear,

14:07.614 --> 14:11.351
are heroes, so you wanna know
who's got my back?

14:13.553 --> 14:14.554
They do.

14:16.623 --> 14:19.226
See, there' more than
coworkers or friends.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.793
They're my family.

14:22.729 --> 14:24.898
There's nothing stronger
than family.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.207
(upbeat music)

14:34.241 --> 14:35.575
CAMDEN:
Don't touch me, scuzzbag.

14:35.608 --> 14:36.843
JESSE:
You're the scuzzbag, tool!

14:36.876 --> 14:38.445
CAMDEN:
Nobody likes you at school.

14:38.478 --> 14:39.779
Ma, he's doing it again.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.915
Camden, I told you

14:41.949 --> 14:43.383
not to say things like that
about your brother.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.384
CAMDEN: I can't help it
if it's true.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.618
JESSE: Mom!

14:45.652 --> 14:47.620
Jesse, there's nothing
I can do right now.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.923
There's never anything
you can do.

14:49.957 --> 14:51.124
Ow, quit it!

14:51.158 --> 14:52.425
-Mom!
-Camden.

14:52.459 --> 14:53.961
CAMDEN: I'm not
doing anything. He's lying.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.262
JESSE:
I'm not lying. You're lying.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.529
(tires squealing)

14:56.563 --> 14:57.864
JUDY: Don't make me
have to stop this car.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.366
CAMDEN: Mom,
he was asking for it.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.968
JESSE: No, I'm not.
You're just a big, fat jerk.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.170
(horn honking)

15:04.437 --> 15:06.773
-Stop!
-Here's two for flinching.

15:06.806 --> 15:07.907
Mom!

15:07.941 --> 15:09.809
Camden, I am not
gonna warn you again!

15:09.842 --> 15:11.044
You understand
what I'm saying?

15:11.078 --> 15:12.312
-BOTH: Mom!
-Oh, my God!

15:12.345 --> 15:14.481
-(horn honks)
-(tires squeal)

15:17.750 --> 15:20.753
(boys laughing)

15:21.754 --> 15:22.922
Why are you laughing?

15:22.956 --> 15:24.757
It's not funny!

15:24.791 --> 15:26.326
You shoulda
seen your face.

15:26.359 --> 15:29.129
JESSE:
She was all like, "Ah!"

15:29.162 --> 15:31.264
(all laugh)

15:31.298 --> 15:33.733
Oh, so now you're on
the same side.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.603
Fine.
(laughs)

15:36.636 --> 15:37.670
Whoa!

15:56.723 --> 15:58.525
CAMDEN (whispering):
The road is gone.

15:58.558 --> 16:01.528
(dramatic music swells)

16:01.561 --> 16:03.997
*

16:09.469 --> 16:10.970
Driver's name
is Judith Spivey.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.206
She and her two sons are
trapped inside the vehicle.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.875
Mom's unconscious,
but the kids seem to be okay.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.044
It looks like
they tumbled a bit

16:17.077 --> 16:18.878
before catching
on the brush.

16:18.911 --> 16:21.014
We better get to work
before we lose any more ground.

16:21.048 --> 16:22.515
Eddie, set up the winch.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.517
Lena, I want you to get down
there and anchor that vehicle.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.119
Take it slow.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.687
Too much weight and this
cliffside can come down.

16:27.720 --> 16:28.855
We don't want that car
to go along with it.

16:28.888 --> 16:30.357
(tense music)

16:30.390 --> 16:31.858
Hey, Cap, I'm worried
about the mom.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.226
Maybe the crash
just knocked her out,

16:33.260 --> 16:34.327
but she's still not awake.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.329
All right,
harness up.

16:36.363 --> 16:43.236
*

16:46.206 --> 16:49.176
(intense music)

16:49.209 --> 16:56.083
*

16:59.452 --> 17:01.254
CHIMNEY:
Guys, I'll be right with you.

17:01.288 --> 17:02.655
I'm gonna check on
your mother.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.592
*

17:05.625 --> 17:07.260
(wind howling)

17:07.294 --> 17:12.665
*

17:12.699 --> 17:15.234
Cap, pulse is steady,
but she's out like a light.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.337
We're gonna need the basket.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.606
On it, Cap.

17:19.638 --> 17:21.540
-(radio beeps)
-How the kids doing?

17:22.709 --> 17:24.611
Terrified.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.682
LENA:
Hey, I'm Lena.

17:29.716 --> 17:30.950
What are your names?

17:30.983 --> 17:32.585
I'm Camden.

17:32.619 --> 17:33.853
He's Jesse.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.088
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

17:35.122 --> 17:36.589
The car
started shifting!

17:36.623 --> 17:37.957
Get clear!

17:37.990 --> 17:39.859
(line clangs)

17:39.892 --> 17:41.594
(metal creaking)

17:41.628 --> 17:43.563
(wind howling)

17:43.596 --> 17:45.532
-(boys scream)
-(glass shatters)

17:45.565 --> 17:48.535
(intense music)

17:48.568 --> 17:50.870
Lena, Chim, what's your status?

17:50.903 --> 17:53.206
-LENA: All good, Cap.
-CHIMNEY: All good, Cap.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.508
The damn car dropped
another 20 feet.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.378
BOBBY: Ground's too soft.
It's not gonna hold.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.712
Hop in the cab.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.914
Be prepared to bug out of here
if this thing goes south.

18:01.948 --> 18:05.252
We need to clear that ambulance
and all nonessential equipment,

18:05.285 --> 18:08.121
pull back as much weight as we
can from this cliffside now.

18:08.155 --> 18:11.224
(dramatic music)

18:11.258 --> 18:18.131
*

18:22.369 --> 18:24.237
You guys okay?

18:24.271 --> 18:25.738
(truck horn honks)

18:25.772 --> 18:27.574
That's our signal to move.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.909
-Camden, we're gonna--
-Take Jesse first.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.745
I'm not leaving mom.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.113
I'm not leaving you.

18:34.147 --> 18:36.749
Jesse, listen to me.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.285
You need to go with her.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.086
I'll be
right behind you.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.688
It's gonna be okay.

18:41.721 --> 18:42.855
Go now.

18:42.889 --> 18:46.159
LENA: Come on, Jesse.
Grab onto me.

18:46.193 --> 18:48.261
Passengers secured.
Green light.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.529
Copy.
Bring him up.

18:49.562 --> 18:52.532
(intense music)

18:52.565 --> 18:55.202
*

18:55.235 --> 18:57.270
CHIMNEY: Cap,
we gotta get the mom up.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.038
Is she dead?

18:59.071 --> 19:01.708
No, Camden,
she's not dead.

19:01.741 --> 19:04.677
Good, Jesse's only nine.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.513
He's too little
to not have a mom.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.281
(tender piano music)

19:08.315 --> 19:09.482
(car creaking)

19:09.516 --> 19:11.117
(sighs)

19:11.150 --> 19:13.786
*

19:13.820 --> 19:17.156
All right,
how 'bout we make a deal?

19:17.190 --> 19:21.528
You do exactly what I tell,
I get you both out of here,

19:21.561 --> 19:24.030
and no one loses
their mom today.

19:24.063 --> 19:27.234
*

19:27.267 --> 19:29.536
HEN: Hey, let me take
a look at you.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.306
(radio beeps)

19:33.340 --> 19:35.575
Lena is coming down
with the basket.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.143
Hey, Bosko,

19:37.176 --> 19:40.213
hold the basket steady
while I get Mom in it.

19:40.247 --> 19:41.681
Here we go.

19:41.714 --> 19:45.385
One, two, three!

19:45.418 --> 19:46.386
Cam, stay with me.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.420
Your mom's gonna be good.

19:47.454 --> 19:49.055
All right, Lena,
she's all yours.

19:49.088 --> 19:51.924
(suspenseful music)

19:51.958 --> 19:54.060
Come on, kid,
you're riding with me.

19:54.093 --> 20:00.967
*

20:08.140 --> 20:09.876
Come on, kid,
you're riding with me.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.945
-Okay?
-Yeah.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.481
BOBBY:
Okay, get her loaded up.

20:16.148 --> 20:17.850
(rocks clatter)

20:17.884 --> 20:19.752
EDDIE: Cap,
we're running out of time.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.053
Get ready
to cut her loose.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.455
(rocks clattering)

20:22.489 --> 20:23.856
Chim, you gotta move.

20:23.890 --> 20:24.857
CHIMNEY (over radio):
Get us out of here, Cap.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.359
Green, green, green!

20:26.393 --> 20:27.394
Now.

20:30.330 --> 20:33.333
-(metal clanging)
-(glass smashing)

20:44.277 --> 20:45.812
Safe and sound.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.146
BOBBY: Cutting it
kinda close there.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.616
I wanted
to make an entrance.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.985
JESSE:
Cam!

20:54.321 --> 20:55.488
(gasps)

20:55.522 --> 20:57.290
LAFD, ma'am.
You were in an accident.

20:57.324 --> 20:58.925
-(moans)
-We're gonna take you

20:58.958 --> 21:01.294
to the hospital now
to be checked out, okay?

21:01.328 --> 21:03.830
(weakly) But my--
I've got--I've got kids.

21:03.863 --> 21:07.434
(sentimental music)

21:07.467 --> 21:09.802
They're taking care
of each other.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.704
*

21:17.477 --> 21:18.645
I looked for priors

21:18.678 --> 21:21.448
on that name you gave me,
Vincent Dagastino.

21:21.481 --> 21:25.452
Couple D&Ds, drunk and
disorderly, a few years back.

21:25.485 --> 21:29.088
Uh, one speeding violation
about five years ago.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.491
So no arrests for

21:31.524 --> 21:33.526
battery, assault,
anything violent?

21:33.560 --> 21:35.362
ATHENA: Nothing that made it
into his record.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.864
I mean, if you're not sure,
I could, um--

21:37.897 --> 21:39.332
I could do
a little more digging,

21:39.366 --> 21:40.833
call some friends.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.669
MADDIE: No, that's okay.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.170
I'm not really sure
about anything.

21:45.204 --> 21:47.440
I feel like maybe
I'm chasing shadows here.

21:47.474 --> 21:50.309
(insects chirping)

21:50.343 --> 21:53.946
Um, but thanks for your help.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.281
ATHENA: Anytime.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.050
Uh, yeah,
I really appreciate it.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.987
(death metal
blaring from radio)

22:01.020 --> 22:02.655
-Bye.
-ATHENA: Bye.

22:02.689 --> 22:05.492
(loud death metal continues)

22:05.525 --> 22:07.627
(sighs)

22:07.660 --> 22:10.630
(tense music)

22:10.663 --> 22:17.537
*

22:23.743 --> 22:26.178
MAN: Hey, I'm home.
What's for dinner?

22:26.212 --> 22:28.548
(timer beeps)

22:31.518 --> 22:35.622
ATHENA: Mmm, mmm,
do I smell candied yams?

22:36.623 --> 22:38.224
I still can't believe
that you invited him

22:38.257 --> 22:39.392
without talking to me first.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.861
I just wanted him
to know that no matter what,

22:41.894 --> 22:43.362
he's still family.

22:43.396 --> 22:46.198
Thought dinner would give you
two time to work things out.

22:46.232 --> 22:48.100
Athena, I didn't tell him.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.570
I thought you said
he came by the firehouse.

22:50.603 --> 22:52.071
He did, but then we had
to go out on a call.

22:52.104 --> 22:54.106
(doorbell rings)

22:54.140 --> 22:55.875
-I'll get the door.
-Hmm.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.579
I'll get the wine.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.013
(chuckles)

23:01.047 --> 23:03.416
BUCK: So I told
that lawyer off big-time.

23:03.450 --> 23:04.851
You know, I said,
"You're not gonna get me

23:04.884 --> 23:08.287
to sign any affidavit that
blames the 118 for anything."

23:08.320 --> 23:09.889
Appreciate that.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.290
BUCK: Please,
the nerve of that guy

23:11.323 --> 23:14.060
to think I would turn
on my friends? Uh-uh.

23:14.093 --> 23:15.962
(chuckles)

23:15.995 --> 23:18.197
Whew, I missed
your cooking, Cap.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.966
Well, I miss your eating.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.367
Never have to worry
about leftovers.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.436
-Collard greens?
-Oh, no, not for me.

23:23.470 --> 23:24.904
Uh, I can't eat those,

23:24.937 --> 23:26.639
not while I'm on
the blood thinners.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.140
Too much vitamin K.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.643
Oh, it sounds like

23:30.677 --> 23:33.079
you're taking your health
very seriously.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.413
I figure the better
I manage this,

23:34.447 --> 23:37.383
the sooner I can
go back to work.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.885
That's very mature
of you, Buck.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.119
BUCK:
Thank you.

23:40.152 --> 23:43.590
Hey, that--that lawyer,
uh, he did get me thinking.

23:43.623 --> 23:45.291
There's strength
in numbers, right?

23:45.324 --> 23:48.394
Maybe I could get everyone
to sign a statement of support

23:48.427 --> 23:49.796
or something,
show the higher-ups

23:49.829 --> 23:51.964
that--that you guys
don't think I'm liability.

23:51.998 --> 23:53.900
-Buck--
-They'd have to listen, right?

23:53.933 --> 23:55.802
-I want you to listen to me.
-BUCK: If you told them

23:55.835 --> 23:57.303
that I was ready,
I mean, these--these dumbasses,

23:57.336 --> 23:59.405
they would--they would
have no right to keep me--

23:59.438 --> 24:01.007
I'm the dumbass.

24:06.345 --> 24:08.581
Uh, what?

24:08.615 --> 24:11.150
You're not ready.

24:11.183 --> 24:13.019
That's what I told them
when they asked.

24:13.052 --> 24:15.421
Would anybody like
any corn bread?

24:15.454 --> 24:16.523
BOBBY: Thank you.

24:16.556 --> 24:18.124
You're the reason
they won't let me back?

24:18.157 --> 24:20.660
The medication
is the reason.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.832
Bobby is just worried
about you, Buck, that's all.

24:25.865 --> 24:27.033
We all are.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.837
I thought you were
on my side.

24:32.639 --> 24:34.306
I thought you were
my friend.

24:34.340 --> 24:36.976
I am your friend.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.879
I am also the captain of almost
20 other firefighters

24:39.912 --> 24:42.682
whose lives and safety
depend on decisions I make,

24:42.715 --> 24:43.983
and I can't
put them at risk.

24:44.016 --> 24:45.051
If you're not operating
at 100%--

24:45.084 --> 24:47.319
(pounding table)
I am at 100%!

24:47.353 --> 24:48.788
I--

24:48.821 --> 24:50.356
May--maybe even more, you know?

24:50.389 --> 24:52.725
I--I--I've never f--
felt so good.

24:52.759 --> 24:56.295
Buck, I know that you went
through a lot in that tsunami

24:56.328 --> 24:59.165
and maybe you feel like
you can survive anything.

24:59.198 --> 25:01.734
Anything.

25:01.768 --> 25:03.536
Like a knife in my back.

25:03.570 --> 25:09.308
Um, Athena, I just wanna say
thank you for inviting me.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.043
I'm sorry.
I--I--I--I gotta go.

25:11.077 --> 25:12.912
BOBBY:
Okay, Buck, hold on.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.146
ATHENA:
You don't have to leave.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.214
BOBBY: Buck.

25:15.247 --> 25:18.217
(somber music)

25:18.250 --> 25:21.087
*

25:21.120 --> 25:23.055

25:26.292 --> 25:29.361
(woman shouting indistinctly)

25:29.395 --> 25:30.496
TARA:
You have to listen to me.

25:30.529 --> 25:31.898
He's just a friend.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.365
(glass shatters)

25:33.399 --> 25:35.267
(ominous music)

25:35.301 --> 25:37.737
VINCENT: Tell me the truth,
damn it!

25:37.770 --> 25:39.772
Don't make me do something
you'll regret.

25:39.806 --> 25:41.874
TARA: That is it, Vincent!
That's it!

25:41.908 --> 25:43.409
VINCENT: You really think
I'm gonna believe that?

25:43.442 --> 25:44.677
-TARA: Yes!
-VINCENT: Get over here!

25:44.711 --> 25:46.445
TARA:
No, no, Vincent, stop, stop!

25:46.478 --> 25:48.781
Just let me go!

25:48.815 --> 25:50.717
Vincent,
where are you going?

25:50.750 --> 25:52.184
VINCENT: I just told you!

25:52.218 --> 25:53.419
I'm getting something
out of the car.

25:53.452 --> 25:56.422
(ominous music)

25:56.455 --> 25:59.225

25:59.258 --> 26:00.893
(engine turns over)

26:09.135 --> 26:11.971
(tires squealing)

26:15.307 --> 26:17.109
Watch where you're going,
moron!

26:18.177 --> 26:20.947
(crying)

26:20.980 --> 26:24.150
(dramatic music swells)

26:30.156 --> 26:32.158
CHASE: If you go down this
road, I need you to know

26:32.191 --> 26:34.260
suing the city
is not a small matter.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.929
Look, all I want
is my job back.

26:36.963 --> 26:38.564
But if you don't win,

26:38.597 --> 26:39.666
not only will
you never work

26:39.699 --> 26:41.267
as a firefighter
in Los Angeles again,

26:41.300 --> 26:43.502
I doubt any department
in the country will hire you.

26:43.535 --> 26:45.437
(tense music)

26:45.471 --> 26:47.406
They'll see me
as a...

26:47.439 --> 26:49.075
a squeaky wheel.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.243
Or worse.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.578
You see,
once a potential employer

26:52.611 --> 26:54.446
perceives you
as litigious liability,

26:54.480 --> 26:56.248
it is impossible
to unring that bell.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.250
Not if I win.

26:58.284 --> 27:01.954
Then I'm back with the 118,
a--a firefighter.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.256
You should also be aware
that during this process,

27:04.290 --> 27:06.458
it's best to have no contact
with anyone from

27:06.492 --> 27:08.594
or tangentially connected
to your station house.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.597
That means no texts,
no calls,

27:11.630 --> 27:13.933
nothing that could
compromise our case.

27:13.966 --> 27:17.203
(somber music)

27:17.236 --> 27:18.604
I'm not sure we have much

27:18.637 --> 27:20.539
to say to each other
right now anyway.

27:20.572 --> 27:22.508
*

27:22.541 --> 27:24.576
I'm alone in this fight.

27:28.380 --> 27:29.448
LENA:
"Keep loving him."

27:29.481 --> 27:31.617
Did he write that
on a prescription pad?

27:31.650 --> 27:33.686
Doesn't sound
like you're a fan.

27:33.720 --> 27:34.954
Hands up.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.055
(sighs)

27:36.088 --> 27:38.024
The headshrinkers
have their place.

27:38.057 --> 27:40.026
It's a very
touchy-feely place,

27:40.059 --> 27:42.294
but that works
for some people.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.796
Oh, not you?

27:43.830 --> 27:45.197
I went to one once...

27:47.934 --> 27:50.870
When I was a kid
after my dad died.

27:50.903 --> 27:53.039
This lady
had hand puppets.

27:53.072 --> 27:54.907
(scoffs)
Did that help?

27:54.941 --> 27:56.642
I made her cry,

27:56.675 --> 27:58.310
and then I told my mom
I didn't wanna go back.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.747
Oh, great,
I feel encouraged.

28:02.414 --> 28:05.051
Look, everyone deals
with trauma differently.

28:05.084 --> 28:08.354
I don't know your kid,
but I know what worked for me.

28:08.387 --> 28:10.189
It was when my mom
told me how she was feeling,

28:10.222 --> 28:13.726
that she was sad
and that it was okay.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.862
However we felt,
we were in it together,

28:15.895 --> 28:17.229
no matter what.

28:19.799 --> 28:22.434
-Sounds like good advice.
-She's a good mom.

28:22.468 --> 28:24.003
(Jimmy Buffett's
"Margaritaville" playing)

28:24.036 --> 28:25.237
CYNN: You bitch.

28:25.271 --> 28:26.939
MOIRA:
Who are you calling a bitch?

28:26.973 --> 28:28.908
CYNN:
Who do you think, bitch?

28:28.941 --> 28:30.609
You said that we were
gonna sell all of Mom's stuff

28:30.642 --> 28:32.879
and we were gonna
split the profits 50/50.

28:32.912 --> 28:35.714
I'm sorry, it's not as easy
for me as it is for you.

28:35.748 --> 28:38.117
I told you, you can't
be overly sentimental.

28:38.150 --> 28:39.551
It's just things.

28:39.585 --> 28:40.787
I know.
I'm trying.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.021
-You're trying?
-Yeah.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.190
What about the lamp?

28:44.223 --> 28:45.958
I was the one
who gave that to her.

28:45.992 --> 28:47.126
You know what?

28:47.159 --> 28:48.694
If you wanna walk around
and just pick up

28:48.727 --> 28:51.430
all the cheap crap
you bought her, go right ahead.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.199
Oh, that filled with vodka

28:53.232 --> 28:54.767
got Mom through
her book club meetings.

28:54.801 --> 28:55.802
She loved that cup.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.770
I'm sure she did.

28:57.804 --> 28:59.939
What the hell are you
doing over there anyway?

28:59.972 --> 29:01.473
Are you gonna help me
with this or not?

29:01.507 --> 29:02.975
I'm making margaritas.

29:03.009 --> 29:04.310
You didn't think
I was gonna get through

29:04.343 --> 29:06.645
this little reunion
of ours sober, did you?

29:06.678 --> 29:08.915
You know what?
I bought her this blender too.

29:08.948 --> 29:11.083
Oh, my God, why is everything
a competition with you?

29:11.117 --> 29:12.318
(blender whirs)

29:12.351 --> 29:13.986
What?

29:14.020 --> 29:16.789
-I said--
-(blender pulses)

29:16.823 --> 29:17.824
I'm sorry, what?

29:17.857 --> 29:19.892
Okay, are you gonna--

29:19.926 --> 29:23.930
(blender whirring)

29:23.963 --> 29:25.597
Are you gonna offer me
some of that?

29:25.631 --> 29:26.833
I guess.

29:26.866 --> 29:28.467
But try not to get
too hammered.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.769
I don't need you puking
all over Mom's house.

29:30.803 --> 29:32.338
I was 14 years old.

29:32.371 --> 29:34.006
Why do you always
bring that up?

29:34.040 --> 29:36.775
Because somehow I was
the one who got grounded.

29:36.809 --> 29:38.777
Oh, yum.

29:38.811 --> 29:40.612
You know, actually,
I could use a blender.

29:40.646 --> 29:41.948
Haven't you
gotten enough?

29:41.981 --> 29:43.149
You still pissed
about the ring?

29:43.182 --> 29:44.350
Of course I'm upset.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.585
The favorite daughter
gets the family heirloom,

29:46.618 --> 29:48.320
the one--
(sighs)

29:48.354 --> 29:50.489
That should have been mine,

29:50.522 --> 29:52.091
but she left it to you, so...

29:52.124 --> 29:54.660
No, you can't
have the blender.

29:54.693 --> 29:56.428
Hold on. Why should you
have gotten the ring?

29:56.462 --> 29:57.864
She bought you a condo.

29:57.897 --> 30:00.132
That was a loan, and I
paid her back with interest.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.267
-Of course you did.
-Yes.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.334
'Cause you're
Little Miss Perfect

30:02.368 --> 30:03.669
and I'm the screwup.
You know what?

30:03.702 --> 30:05.872
This was Mom's apology,
and I'm accepting it.

30:05.905 --> 30:08.640
(Jimmy Buffett's
"Margaritaville" continues)

30:08.674 --> 30:10.042
Just promise me
that you won't

30:10.076 --> 30:11.543
let anything
happen to it, okay?

30:11.577 --> 30:13.312
*

30:13.345 --> 30:14.613
That you keep it
in the family.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.616
(cheerful tropical music
playing)

30:17.649 --> 30:19.385
*

30:19.418 --> 30:21.320
(sighs)

30:21.353 --> 30:24.356
For safekeeping.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.192
Okay?

30:26.225 --> 30:28.227
*

30:28.260 --> 30:32.198
Hey.

30:32.231 --> 30:34.333
-To mom.
-* I blew out my flip-flop

30:34.366 --> 30:36.502
*

30:36.535 --> 30:38.037
* Stepped on a pop-top

30:38.070 --> 30:40.139
CYNN: (snoring)

30:40.172 --> 30:44.343
* Cut my heel,
had to cruise on back home *

30:44.376 --> 30:47.079
(snoring)

30:47.113 --> 30:51.583
* But there's booze
in the blender *

30:51.617 --> 30:55.087
* And soon it will render

30:55.121 --> 30:59.491
* That frozen concoction
that helps me hang on *

30:59.525 --> 31:03.162
*

31:03.195 --> 31:06.698
* Wastin' away again
in Margarita-- *

31:12.438 --> 31:14.373
The thief is out here.

31:14.406 --> 31:15.541
BOBBY:
Thief? I'm sorry.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.343
Uh, dispatch said it was
a medical emergency.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.410
CYNN: It's both.

31:18.444 --> 31:20.279
(dramatic musical sting)

31:20.312 --> 31:21.847
Why is this happening?

31:21.880 --> 31:23.582
Divine retribution,
Moira.

31:23.615 --> 31:26.218
HEN: Hmm, or more likely,
it's an allergic reaction.

31:26.252 --> 31:27.920
BOBBY: All right, ma'am,
is there anything in the house

31:27.954 --> 31:30.089
that you're sensitive to,
medications, foods?

31:30.122 --> 31:31.958
She used to break out in hives
when she was stressed.

31:31.991 --> 31:34.693
I'm not stressed?

31:34.726 --> 31:38.030
Our mom just died,
so I'm--I'm a little stressed.

31:38.064 --> 31:40.232
Stress wouldn't do this.

31:40.266 --> 31:41.800
Which one of you
played bartender?

31:42.935 --> 31:43.902
I did, why?

31:43.936 --> 31:45.371
Phytophotodermatitis,

31:45.404 --> 31:47.806
it's a fancy name
for margarita burns.

31:47.839 --> 31:49.308
Citrus over
a certain temperature

31:49.341 --> 31:51.543
and UV light conditions can
trigger a chemical reaction.

31:51.577 --> 31:54.546
Ma'am, this ring finger,
can you feel it?

31:54.580 --> 31:56.048
No.

31:56.082 --> 31:57.984
HEN: An Epi should
bring down the swelling,

31:58.017 --> 31:59.751
but we're gonna
have to cut this ring off.

31:59.785 --> 32:02.454
No! Uh-uh! No!
You cannot cut that ring.

32:02.488 --> 32:03.622
That is my ring,

32:03.655 --> 32:05.591
and I do not give you
authorization to cut it.

32:05.624 --> 32:07.726
Your sister's finger
is turning blue.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.262
That's the step before black,
when it's dead.

32:10.296 --> 32:11.630
Her whole finger
could fall off.

32:11.663 --> 32:13.299
That sounds horrible.

32:13.332 --> 32:15.934
Can't you just cut the finger
off now before that happens?

32:15.968 --> 32:18.070
BOBBY: Ma'am, I understand that
it's a sentimental object,

32:18.104 --> 32:19.305
so we'll save you the pieces.

32:19.338 --> 32:20.506
I'm gonna give you
the shot.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.108
Oh!
(gasps)

32:22.141 --> 32:23.109
BOBBY: All right, hold still.

32:23.142 --> 32:26.078
(saw whirring)

32:26.112 --> 32:27.113
Wait!

32:29.348 --> 32:30.682
I sold it.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.418
The buyer's
already paid me

32:32.451 --> 32:33.652
a lot.

32:33.685 --> 32:35.521
MOIRA: I knew it.

32:35.554 --> 32:38.757
You are, without a doubt,
the worst person...

32:38.790 --> 32:40.692
-Hey, hey, hey.
-I have ever known!

32:40.726 --> 32:42.461
Come on,
aren't you sisters

32:42.494 --> 32:44.030
mourning your
deceased mother?

32:44.063 --> 32:45.998
Aren't you supposed to be
teaching each other empathy

32:46.032 --> 32:48.067
instead of setting
each other off?

32:50.569 --> 32:52.704
Only child, right?

32:52.738 --> 32:53.739
Obviously.

32:54.673 --> 32:56.208
BOBBY:
Okay, just hold still.

32:56.242 --> 32:59.245
(saw whirring)

33:01.647 --> 33:03.549
Okay, Hen.

33:04.483 --> 33:05.984
(ring snaps)

33:08.920 --> 33:10.656
All right.

33:10.689 --> 33:13.659
(ponderous music)

33:13.692 --> 33:20.566
*

33:22.368 --> 33:25.571
Remember,
sharing is caring.

33:27.373 --> 33:31.510
JOAN JETT: * I hate myself
for loving you *

33:31.543 --> 33:36.182
* Can't break free
from the things that you do *

33:36.215 --> 33:37.816
* I wanna walk, but I...

33:37.849 --> 33:38.984
MADDIE:
Excuse me.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.586
Do you know how this works?

33:40.619 --> 33:41.587
(laughs)

33:41.620 --> 33:44.090
Yeah, it's, uh,
not very intuitive,

33:44.123 --> 33:45.757
but once you know
all the routines,

33:45.791 --> 33:46.825
it's really easy.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.060
I could show you.

33:48.094 --> 33:49.561
Oh, no, I wouldn't
want to put you out.

33:49.595 --> 33:51.730
Oh, it's no trouble.
I'm a trainer.

33:51.763 --> 33:54.032
Of course you are.
I'm sorry. I'm new. I--

33:54.066 --> 33:56.102
I'm Tara.

33:56.135 --> 33:57.369
Maddie.

33:57.403 --> 34:00.206
Um, do you,
by any chance,

34:00.239 --> 34:02.374
have any openings
in your schedule?

34:02.408 --> 34:04.776
Actually,
I'm free right now.

34:04.810 --> 34:05.944
So is the first session.

34:05.977 --> 34:08.914
Oh, okay,
well, why not?

34:08.947 --> 34:11.617
Let's get you started on...
the treadmill,

34:11.650 --> 34:12.784
get you warmed up.

34:12.818 --> 34:15.420
Awesome.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.456
Okay, I'm already sore.

34:17.489 --> 34:18.956
(both laugh)

34:18.989 --> 34:21.393
Well, that's
scientifically impossible,

34:21.427 --> 34:24.062
but if you get that
recovery drink I recommended,

34:24.096 --> 34:25.630
-that should help.
-I will.

34:25.664 --> 34:26.797
Thanks.

34:26.831 --> 34:29.101
So we're on again
for next Thursday night?

34:29.135 --> 34:30.969
Are you sure 9:00
isn't too late?

34:31.002 --> 34:33.572
I do shift work,
so I'm used to the crazy hours.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.541
-(phone buzzes)
-MADDIE: Ah.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.309
So what do you do?

34:37.342 --> 34:38.377
I'm a nurse.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.579
(car honking frantically)

34:40.612 --> 34:43.215
Look like
my ride's here.

34:43.248 --> 34:46.217
(ominous music)

34:46.252 --> 34:47.886
*

34:47.918 --> 34:49.621
Maddie, this is my husband,
Vincent.

34:49.655 --> 34:52.424
*

34:52.458 --> 34:53.458
Nice to meet you.

34:53.492 --> 34:54.826
*

34:54.860 --> 34:56.128
You too, Vincent.

34:56.161 --> 34:58.964
*

34:58.997 --> 35:01.467
Maddie's a--a new client
of mine.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.302
*

35:03.335 --> 35:05.471
We're gonna get stronger
together, right, Maddie?

35:05.504 --> 35:07.739
Yeah.

35:07.773 --> 35:10.242
TARA:
See you next Thursday.

35:10.276 --> 35:12.144
(car door slams)

35:12.178 --> 35:17.015
*

35:22.120 --> 35:23.522
(elevator dings)

35:23.555 --> 35:26.525
(curious music)

35:26.558 --> 35:30.061
*

35:33.299 --> 35:35.133
Wow, this is a surprise.

35:35.167 --> 35:36.502
What are you doing here?

35:36.535 --> 35:37.936
Hey.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.138
Thought I'd try and catch you
before you started your shift.

35:40.172 --> 35:42.641
I wanted to talk to you
about the other day,

35:42.674 --> 35:45.277
the plate or what happened
after the plate.

35:45.311 --> 35:46.778
Oh, that was nothing.
You just--

35:46.812 --> 35:48.280
you startled me,
that's all.

35:48.314 --> 35:50.849
Uh...

35:50.882 --> 35:52.651
It wasn't nothing,
Maddie.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.353
Not exactly sure
what to call it. Uh...

35:54.386 --> 35:56.722
Okay, I swear it had nothing
to do with you.

35:56.755 --> 35:59.291
I know.

35:59.325 --> 36:02.060
At first, I didn't,
but we had this call today...

36:02.093 --> 36:04.062
uh, yesterday, I guess.

36:04.095 --> 36:05.864
This car fell off the cliff

36:05.897 --> 36:07.199
Oh, yeah, I heard
about that,

36:07.233 --> 36:09.000
the mom and her
two kids, right?

36:09.034 --> 36:10.336
Yeah.

36:10.369 --> 36:13.472
Well, the older kid,
he was probably 12 or 13.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.140
I could see him
trying to be strong

36:15.173 --> 36:18.143
for his brother
and his mother,

36:18.176 --> 36:22.013
and it just took me back
to when I was a kid

36:22.047 --> 36:23.515
trying to be strong
for my mother

36:23.549 --> 36:25.917
while some doctor
explains cancer to us,

36:25.951 --> 36:29.421
and it just triggered
all these emotions in me.

36:29.455 --> 36:31.056
You never told me
about that.

36:32.224 --> 36:35.327
Well, I had never really
thought about that in years,

36:35.361 --> 36:38.230
but all of a sudden,
there it was.

36:38.264 --> 36:42.534
You know, I didn't plan it,
couldn't control it.

36:42.568 --> 36:43.902
It just happened.

36:43.935 --> 36:45.904
There's gotta be
a word for that.

36:45.937 --> 36:48.674
I'm sure the Germans
have something.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.843
It's probably 27 syllables long
and completely unpronounceable,

36:51.877 --> 36:55.414
but whatever it is,
it's a part of us,

36:55.447 --> 36:57.549
who we are,

36:57.583 --> 36:59.718
and I just never
want you to ever feel

36:59.751 --> 37:02.087
like you have
to hide that from me.

37:03.422 --> 37:04.756
Okay.

37:04.790 --> 37:06.392
(tender music)

37:06.425 --> 37:07.759
No more hiding.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.295
*

37:09.328 --> 37:10.962
Okay.

37:10.996 --> 37:12.364
I'm gonna
call you later.

37:12.398 --> 37:14.400
Can't wait.

37:14.433 --> 37:20.472
*

37:21.973 --> 37:24.943
(gentle music)

37:24.976 --> 37:31.049
*

37:31.082 --> 37:34.085
(timer beeping)

37:38.590 --> 37:40.258
(whispers)
Hey.

37:40.292 --> 37:43.128
(whispers)
Hey, you awake?

37:45.130 --> 37:46.765
It's time for the shot.

37:46.798 --> 37:48.400
Oh.

37:48.434 --> 37:50.402
You could flirt
with a girl a little

37:50.436 --> 37:52.304
before
you knock her up.

37:52.338 --> 37:53.839
(chuckles softly)

37:53.872 --> 37:56.642
It's also
a beneficial activity

37:56.675 --> 37:58.610
when trying
to induce pregnancy.

37:58.644 --> 38:05.517
*

38:09.688 --> 38:11.323
Are we still doing this?

38:13.459 --> 38:15.193
This is not just about
what I want.

38:15.226 --> 38:17.596
It's about
what we want.

38:17.629 --> 38:22.334
When I was a little girl,
I was lonely.

38:22.368 --> 38:26.672
Not all the time,
but after my dad left

38:26.705 --> 38:29.808
and my mom
was working two jobs,

38:29.841 --> 38:34.380
I felt very alone
in the world.

38:34.413 --> 38:37.683
*

38:37.716 --> 38:40.652
I don't want Denny
to feel that way.

38:40.686 --> 38:44.456
He may not like the idea
of a sibling right now,

38:44.490 --> 38:48.293
but there'll also be wonderful
times filled with love.

38:48.326 --> 38:52.230
Hell, they can commiserate
about their crazy mothers.

38:52.263 --> 38:55.734
(both laugh)

38:55.767 --> 38:57.903
They'll never be bored.

38:57.936 --> 39:00.205
No.
(chuckles)

39:00.238 --> 39:02.374
I'm ready if you are.

39:05.343 --> 39:06.578
Ah!

39:06.612 --> 39:08.447
Bah!

39:09.681 --> 39:12.150
Tuck these feetsies in.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.519
Okay.

39:15.220 --> 39:17.222
Let me see
those pearly whites.

39:20.225 --> 39:21.660
Whoa, whoa.

39:21.693 --> 39:24.563
Whoa, very pearly.

39:24.596 --> 39:27.232
Good job.

39:27.265 --> 39:31.102
Hey, buddy, you know if
there's anything bothering you,

39:31.136 --> 39:33.104
you can talk to me.
You know that, right?

39:33.138 --> 39:34.706
I know, Daddy.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.509
(tender music)

39:37.543 --> 39:40.612
*

39:40.646 --> 39:43.248
Love you.
Good night.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.885
(sighs)

39:46.918 --> 39:52.090
*

39:52.123 --> 39:55.894
(sentimental music)

39:55.927 --> 39:58.396
(papers rustling)

39:58.430 --> 40:05.303
*

40:07.739 --> 40:08.740
Christopher.

40:12.844 --> 40:14.412
Is this Mom?

40:18.083 --> 40:19.751
Hey.

40:19.785 --> 40:21.487
Is that who you've
been dreaming about?

40:23.589 --> 40:25.023
Why didn't you tell me?

40:25.924 --> 40:28.393
(whispers)
I don't wanna make you sad.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.462
EDDIE: Oh, my.

40:31.830 --> 40:33.999
Hey, hey.

40:35.300 --> 40:39.270
There's nothing wrong
with being sad.

40:39.304 --> 40:41.172
I loved your mom
and I miss her,

40:41.206 --> 40:43.642
probably always will.

40:43.675 --> 40:46.177
But...

40:46.211 --> 40:48.614
we still got each other,

40:48.647 --> 40:53.151
which means
we're gonna be okay.

40:53.184 --> 40:54.452
(whispers)
Okay.

40:54.486 --> 40:56.187
Okay.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.256
*

40:58.289 --> 40:59.991
I love you, Daddy.

41:00.025 --> 41:02.628
*

41:02.661 --> 41:04.162
(doorbell rings)

41:11.469 --> 41:12.871
Buck,
is everything all right?

41:12.904 --> 41:14.973
I'm sorry to come by
so late.

41:15.006 --> 41:15.974
ATHENA: Who is it?

41:16.007 --> 41:17.342
It's Buck.

41:18.544 --> 41:20.278
BUCK:
Just wanted to apologize

41:20.311 --> 41:22.848
to the both of you
for walking out on dinner.

41:24.082 --> 41:25.984
ATHENA: Oh, things just got
a little heated.

41:26.017 --> 41:28.219
No need to apologize.

41:28.253 --> 41:29.688
Why don't you
come on in?

41:29.721 --> 41:31.823
-BOBBY: Yeah.
-Sorry, I can't do that.

41:32.991 --> 41:37.128
Uh, this will be the last time
we can talk for a while.

41:37.162 --> 41:39.631
Buck,
what is going on?

41:39.665 --> 41:42.634
(ominous music)

41:42.668 --> 41:45.470
*

41:45.503 --> 41:48.540
I thought you should
hear it from me.

41:48.574 --> 41:52.443
I figured I should be
the one to deliver this.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.385
I'm suing the city,

42:00.418 --> 42:03.722
the department,

42:03.755 --> 42:06.024
and you

42:06.057 --> 42:08.860
for wrongful termination.

42:09.695 --> 42:11.863
Come again?

42:11.897 --> 42:13.431
I told you
I wouldn't stop fighting

42:13.464 --> 42:16.101
until I got my job back,
and I won't...

42:20.471 --> 42:23.074
Even if it means fighting you.

43:15.193 --> 43:16.762
ANNOUNCER: Don't miss
a minute of 9-1-1.

43:16.795 --> 43:19.364
Catch all new episodes,
Mondays on Fox.
