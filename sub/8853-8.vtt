00:00.750 --> 00:02.129
Yooooh!

00:02.130 --> 00:06.559
Carl got his vaporizer delivered to the house.
Nice.

00:06.560 --> 00:08.000
Let's just get vaped out right now.

00:08.060 --> 00:12.170
I'm looking to get weird.

00:12.230 --> 00:14.300
Whoa, hey, cool guy.

00:14.370 --> 00:17.070
Fedora brother.
7-11 hat rack.

00:17.140 --> 00:18.410
They've got deals.

00:18.470 --> 00:19.770
People forget that
they have more than just,

00:19.840 --> 00:23.280
you know, old hot dogs.
No. No, no, no.

00:23.350 --> 00:25.310
Adam, come on, man.
One fedora per crew.

00:25.380 --> 00:28.050
No, I'm pretty sure
the more fedoras, the better.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.320
'Cause I look like
I'm in a ska band right now,

00:30.390 --> 00:31.550
like I'm in reel big fish.

00:31.620 --> 00:33.290
Adam, I beg to differ.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.460
We're not a house
full of Cubans, man.

00:35.520 --> 00:37.860
We're white dudes.
We gotta be careful.

00:37.930 --> 00:41.230
'Cause we can be very
unfashionable very quickly.

00:41.300 --> 00:44.170
Mrs. Lawler.
It's almost after dark.

00:44.230 --> 00:45.670
If you dress like that,
you're asking for it.

00:45.730 --> 00:48.670
Hey, why don't you losers
try an organized sport for once?

00:48.740 --> 00:50.540
Hey, slow down!

00:50.610 --> 00:51.740
This is not the freeway.

00:51.810 --> 00:53.940
This neighborhood
is on lockdown.

00:54.010 --> 00:56.680
Hoo.

00:57.950 --> 00:59.780
Honestly.

01:07.060 --> 01:08.460
Yeah, hello.

01:08.520 --> 01:10.220
Hi, yeah, I wanna report
a robbery in progress right now.

01:10.290 --> 01:11.960
Who am I?

01:12.030 --> 01:16.060
I'm the goddamn
neighborhood watch.

01:16.130 --> 01:18.030
Oh, sorry.
For legal reasons?

01:18.100 --> 01:20.200
Um, it's Anders Holmvik.

01:20.270 --> 01:22.100
It's okay, girls.

01:22.170 --> 01:25.270
Sheriff Holmvik laid down
the law in a major way.

01:25.340 --> 01:28.040
Now why don't we say
buh-bye to--

01:28.110 --> 01:29.680
- hey, what did I do to you,
Ders?

01:29.750 --> 01:32.050
You know, we're more alike
than you even know, man.

01:32.110 --> 01:33.880
This is not over.
Not over.

01:33.950 --> 01:37.120
Blake's friend
and my weed dealer, Karl.

01:37.190 --> 01:38.690
Great, Ders.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.350
This is the second time
in my life

01:40.420 --> 01:42.160
that I just really don't
like you.

01:42.220 --> 01:43.890
Now where am I supposed to buy
my weed from, huh?

01:43.960 --> 01:45.490
'Cause I'm not gonna get
my ass kicked

01:45.560 --> 01:47.090

If you see the neighbor's house
getting broken into,

02:04.710 --> 02:07.250
it's probably just Karl
high out of his mind

02:07.320 --> 02:08.949
thinking he's locked out of
our house.

02:09.020 --> 02:10.150
I said I'm sorry.

02:10.220 --> 02:11.820
Okay, well, you're not sorry

02:11.890 --> 02:13.350
because you're popping
a straight-up bone cone

02:13.420 --> 02:15.320

We blazed the last of our weed,

02:30.740 --> 02:32.640
and you know I can't eat
unless I've smoked.

02:32.710 --> 02:34.740
Adam bear needs to eat.

02:34.810 --> 02:37.410

02:37.480 --> 02:38.780
I'm gaunt right now.

02:38.850 --> 02:40.750
I think you suckers
are just jealous

02:40.820 --> 02:43.320
that I'm in the newspaper,
and you have a picture

02:43.390 --> 02:44.790
of a dude's dick
on your computer, man.

02:44.850 --> 02:46.920
Whoa, yeah, you do.

02:46.990 --> 02:48.290
You are perverted.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.690
Okay, this is not what it

02:50.760 --> 02:52.430
- Okay.
- No, I'm serious.

02:52.490 --> 02:53.960
I'm part of
the Rancho Cucamonga

02:54.030 --> 02:55.260
Justin Bieber fan club.

02:55.330 --> 02:57.100
That I get.
The guy's infectious.

02:57.170 --> 02:58.970
Yeah, he has, like,
crazy pipes.

02:59.030 --> 03:01.700
Yeah, but this guy,
bieberhole69,

03:01.770 --> 03:03.640
keeps sending me pictures
of his dong because he--

03:03.710 --> 03:04.810
well,
he thinks I'm a little boy.

03:04.870 --> 03:06.710
Why does he think that?

03:06.780 --> 03:08.410
Well, I tell them that I'm 11

03:08.480 --> 03:10.710
so that people don't think
that I'm, like, old and weird.

03:10.780 --> 03:12.380
- That's weird, though.
- Well.

03:12.450 --> 03:13.610
- That's a good idea.
- Hey, guys.

03:13.680 --> 03:14.880
Jillian, hey.

03:14.950 --> 03:18.320
Did, uh, bieberhole69
send you one of--

03:18.390 --> 03:19.450
- oh, my God, that guy sends me

03:19.520 --> 03:20.520
the most suggestive photos.

03:20.590 --> 03:22.190
What is he suggesting?

03:22.260 --> 03:23.890
Like little ding dong
competitions.

03:23.960 --> 03:25.560
- Ugh...
- I know.

03:25.630 --> 03:26.990
I'm like, "I'm not in,
I don't have one."

03:27.060 --> 03:28.460
I say that I'm 11

03:28.530 --> 03:30.160
so that people don't think
I'm old and weird.

03:30.230 --> 03:31.570
We just talked about that.

03:31.630 --> 03:32.930
I just don't want children
to have to be

03:33.000 --> 03:35.340
dodging full grown
male penises.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.570
That makes sense to me.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.410
Well, they should be
basking in the glory

03:38.470 --> 03:39.770
that is "j" to the Bieber.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.180
- Yeah.
- And he's got moves.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.740
He moves like water,
like a water bed.

03:42.810 --> 03:44.250
He does.

03:44.310 --> 03:45.980
He's got the best bangs
in music since '80s metallica.

03:46.050 --> 03:47.310
- Great bangs.
- Oh, my God.

03:47.380 --> 03:48.720
He just does this.
Fft.

03:48.780 --> 03:50.320
He just does swish.
He's a good kid.

03:50.390 --> 03:51.720
The kid is a hell of a talent.

03:51.790 --> 03:54.760
And that is why we're
bringing down bieberhole69.

03:54.820 --> 03:56.560
Yes, I am so down.

03:56.630 --> 03:58.260
- Yes.
- Team Bieber.

03:58.330 --> 04:00.930
Wait.
We have to bust this dude?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.900
Yes, Ders.
I mean, come on.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.430
Imagine this little headline:

04:04.500 --> 04:08.400
<i>Dude [Bleep] Throws pervert</i>
<i>in prison forever.</i>

04:08.470 --> 04:09.970
Little picture of you
right there.

04:10.040 --> 04:12.210
Okay, that's kind of cool.
I'm down with that.

04:12.270 --> 04:13.470
Adam, what do you say?

04:13.540 --> 04:15.010
Yeah, count me in.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.140
I wanna just kind of
rip this guy's heart out, right?

04:17.209 --> 04:19.810
And just take the heart
and suck on a cockle.

04:19.880 --> 04:22.050
That came out weird,
but I'm gonna do that.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.380
I'm sweating right now.

04:23.450 --> 04:24.520
Why am I sweating so badly?

04:24.590 --> 04:25.720
We gotta get you some weed.

04:25.790 --> 04:27.420
Seriously,
you gotta just chill out.

04:27.490 --> 04:29.020
Let's bust
this butthole surfer.

04:29.090 --> 04:30.760
Okay, so I'm just gonna

04:30.830 --> 04:33.860
reply to bieberhole69's post,
okay?

04:33.930 --> 04:37.730
Oh, dude, you should say,
"hey, I'm ten years old,

04:37.800 --> 04:39.770
"but I'm built like
an eight-year-old,

04:39.830 --> 04:41.340
so come and get it."

04:41.400 --> 04:43.040
No, don't write that.

04:43.100 --> 04:44.270
And then capitalize
"come get it."

04:44.340 --> 04:46.110
Don't write that.
Listen.

04:46.170 --> 04:47.470
These guys need to be romanced,
okay?

04:47.540 --> 04:50.040
They're extremely
lonely people.

04:50.110 --> 04:51.910
You gotta make them
feel special and desired.

04:51.980 --> 04:54.080
They want naughty
little boys, dude.

04:54.150 --> 04:56.020
So we have to be
naughty little boys, okay?

04:56.080 --> 04:57.690
If they want peach fuzz,
we have to--

04:57.750 --> 04:59.850
- no, Adam.
They need to be loved, okay?

04:59.920 --> 05:01.790
They're trying to regain
a lost childhood.

05:01.860 --> 05:03.090
Okay, no,
they're looking for peach fuzz--

05:03.160 --> 05:04.690
- I got him.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.090
He's coming over tomorrow.

05:06.160 --> 05:07.460
What did you say?

05:07.530 --> 05:10.500
I said, um, "I'm ten.
Come over tomorrow."

05:10.570 --> 05:12.470
Ooh, yeah.
Come on, princess.

05:12.530 --> 05:14.340
Give it to me.
Whoo!

05:14.400 --> 05:15.640
We are gonna pulverize
this guy.

05:15.700 --> 05:17.100
Shh. Stop, he's here.

05:17.170 --> 05:18.740
Come on.
Here's the plan.

05:18.810 --> 05:21.110
We get him inside,
we whup his ass,

05:21.180 --> 05:22.980
call the cops,
take a picture for the paper,

05:23.040 --> 05:25.110
and become heroes
to bieberites everywhere.

05:25.180 --> 05:27.510
He's probably gonna
write a song about you, dude.

05:27.580 --> 05:28.820
Oh, man, if he hasn't already.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.620
Hey.

05:35.690 --> 05:37.830
Who are you looking for?

05:37.890 --> 05:39.330
Yo, you know what?

05:39.390 --> 05:41.460
I think maybe I have
the wrong address, actually.

05:41.530 --> 05:43.300
Sorry, bro.

05:43.370 --> 05:46.070
Hey, um.

05:46.130 --> 05:47.530
Is that the vapetron
right there,

05:47.600 --> 05:50.170

and combustion chamber?

05:50.240 --> 05:52.010
Yeah. It is.

05:52.070 --> 05:53.110
Why, do you smoke?

05:53.170 --> 05:54.940
Yeah.

the stuff that, uh,

cut me off the team in '04,
if you can believe that much.

06:44.630 --> 06:46.700
I can't believe
we were at olympic trials

06:46.770 --> 06:47.770
the same time;
That's nuts.

06:47.830 --> 06:49.130

- Yes, technically.

06:52.670 --> 06:54.470
Hey, uh, could we get
a picture together?

06:54.540 --> 06:55.840
Yeah, if you don't mind
if I take a piss

06:55.910 --> 06:57.480
off your roof first.

06:57.540 --> 07:00.010

take a piss off our roof.

07:03.620 --> 07:05.120
Oh, yo, I had some tight ass
plans for today,

07:05.180 --> 07:08.250
but I knock on the wrong door
and I meet you fellas.

07:08.320 --> 07:13.120
Dude, that's balling.

07:13.190 --> 07:15.090
Topher is the man,

07:15.160 --> 07:16.760
and he's pissing off our roof
right now.

07:16.830 --> 07:18.060
That is balling.

07:18.130 --> 07:19.560
He's the baller
I was supposed to be.

07:19.630 --> 07:21.100
That's how cool he is.

07:21.170 --> 07:23.100
He's not afraid to piss off
of a stranger's roof.

07:23.170 --> 07:24.670
That's balling.

07:24.740 --> 07:26.370
- Yeah, he balls.
- He balls, big time.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.010
- Yeah, for sure.
- Okay, yes.

07:28.070 --> 07:29.870
It's safe to say
that he's the ballingest guy

07:29.940 --> 07:31.310
we've ever met.

07:31.380 --> 07:33.410
But let's not forget
why he came here:

07:33.480 --> 07:35.510
To butt ram a boy.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.780
So let's focus, please.

07:37.850 --> 07:39.720
It sounds so gross
when you say it that way.

07:39.790 --> 07:41.750
Yeah, I forgot he was here
to do that.

07:41.820 --> 07:43.590
- Gross.
- Hey, you guys.

07:43.660 --> 07:45.190
What do you say
we take this party

07:45.260 --> 07:47.890
downtown and go
to club damnation, huh?

07:47.960 --> 07:49.990
I'm afraid we got
some bad news, Topher.

07:50.060 --> 07:51.260
I'm in. Ders?

07:51.330 --> 07:52.530
I just gotta get
my deep v-neck.

08:04.180 --> 08:06.280
And I like it.
It's great.

08:06.350 --> 08:08.150
Smells like laser tag.
Mm-hmm.

08:08.210 --> 08:09.780
Yeah, it does.
That's that smell.

08:09.850 --> 08:11.120
- In a good way, though.
- Yeah.

08:11.180 --> 08:12.520
Hey, yo, what up, guys?

08:12.580 --> 08:13.890
Let me introduce you
to my friends.

08:13.950 --> 08:15.950
This is Je, Bree,
and over here we got Shanna.

08:16.020 --> 08:17.320
Hey.

08:17.390 --> 08:18.660
Hi.

08:18.720 --> 08:21.830
So where are you girls
living at nowadays?

08:21.890 --> 08:23.560
We live at the penthouse
penthouse.

08:23.630 --> 08:25.160
Oh, you do do?

08:25.230 --> 08:27.830
I do do what?

08:27.900 --> 08:29.730
Uh, you said,
"penthouse penthouse"

08:29.800 --> 08:30.870
and I repeated, "do do,"
'cause--

08:30.940 --> 08:32.169
- hey, bro, chill out.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.770
They live in the penthouse
penthouse.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.039
That's just like
the playboy mansion

08:35.110 --> 08:37.340
only this time,
it's much more doper.

08:37.409 --> 08:38.940
All these pretty chicks
run around,

08:39.010 --> 08:40.549
penetration
and pissing on the floor,

08:40.610 --> 08:41.710
if that's what you're into.

08:41.780 --> 08:43.150
Ah!

08:43.220 --> 08:45.250
Oh, and we met Topher
at one of the penthouse parties.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.520
Oh, my God.

08:46.590 --> 08:48.620
You're gonna bring them
this Saturday?

08:48.690 --> 08:50.150
Maybe if they wanna come.

08:52.020 --> 08:53.190
- I mean, we'll see.
- We'll see, yeah.

08:53.260 --> 08:54.460
We'll probably be
a little busy.

08:54.530 --> 08:55.630
Oh, yeah,
we're might have something

08:55.690 --> 08:57.100
we're getting into, I think.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.530
What are you doing?
Are you--

08:58.600 --> 09:00.300
my high score on brick breaker--
don't you dare. What?

09:00.370 --> 09:02.500
Hello.
Okay, that's a number.

09:02.570 --> 09:04.270
It's, uh, it's official.
All right.

09:04.340 --> 09:06.840
Ah!

09:06.910 --> 09:08.540
Hey. Why don't you guys
meet me back at the vip booth

09:08.610 --> 09:09.610
in, like, five <i>minutos?</i>

09:09.680 --> 09:11.140
That's Spanish for minutes.

09:11.210 --> 09:13.010
♪ 'Cause watching you
is driving me insane ♪

09:15.680 --> 09:17.180
- You're so hot.
- Oh, ho, ho, ho!

09:17.250 --> 09:19.150
Oh!

09:19.220 --> 09:21.250
Whoa, my God.

09:21.320 --> 09:22.520
She just totally
touched both my nipples

09:22.590 --> 09:23.820
with one hand at the same time.

09:23.890 --> 09:25.220
- I like her mouth.
- Chill out. It's on.

09:25.290 --> 09:27.560
Because I told them
that you guys were coke dealers.

09:27.630 --> 09:30.230
And all three of them have
really bad coke problems.

09:30.300 --> 09:33.060
Appreciate it, Toph,
but gotta check one thing for--

09:33.130 --> 09:35.430
holy Moly.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.540
She actually gave me
her real number.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.000
There's a second time
for everything.

09:39.070 --> 09:40.710
This is real,
this is happening.

09:40.770 --> 09:42.470
This is my life!
This is my life!

09:42.540 --> 09:44.040
Hey, Topher.

09:44.110 --> 09:45.440
So how do you know the bouncer?

09:45.510 --> 09:46.710
Oh, Vince?

09:46.780 --> 09:48.210
We went to middle schools
together.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.680
Wait, uh, schools?

09:49.750 --> 09:51.920
School.
Middle school.

09:51.980 --> 09:53.850
Yeah, I--
you said "schools."

09:53.920 --> 09:55.990
No, I didn't.
School. One school.

09:56.060 --> 09:59.290
Look, Topher,
we know what the deal is.

09:59.360 --> 10:04.800
Um, or should I call you
bieberhole69?

10:04.860 --> 10:06.200
Hey, ladies, you know what?

10:06.270 --> 10:07.400
Can you give us a second,
please?

10:09.440 --> 10:10.600
- No, you know what?
- They need to leave.

10:10.670 --> 10:11.670
Can you please excuse us
for a second?

10:11.740 --> 10:13.770
Thank you very much.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.170
I don't get you, dude.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.440
You're, like, handsome as hell.

10:16.510 --> 10:17.680
Thank you.

10:17.740 --> 10:18.880
And you have just swagger
for days.

10:18.940 --> 10:20.240
You could get those chicks
if you wanted.

10:20.310 --> 10:23.180
- Okay, thank you.
- You're a swagger hound.

10:23.250 --> 10:25.250
You take everyone else's
swagger. You hound it.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.490
- You're a swagger hound.
- I don't get it.

10:27.550 --> 10:29.390
You know?
It's like, wasted talent.

10:29.460 --> 10:31.220
It's like if Picasso
quit making music

10:31.290 --> 10:33.760
and just started
Little dudes every day.

10:33.830 --> 10:36.590
I'm understanding
where you're coming from.

10:36.660 --> 10:39.130
You guys are not understanding
where I'm coming from, okay?

10:39.200 --> 10:40.530
Because it's like,

10:40.600 --> 10:41.900
do we really need to talk
about this right now?

10:41.970 --> 10:43.600
All we're saying is that

10:43.670 --> 10:45.040
you were coming over to
our house

10:45.100 --> 10:46.870
to bang a little dude.

10:46.940 --> 10:48.310
Yes.

10:48.370 --> 10:49.910
I was gonna have sex
with a little dude, yes.

10:49.980 --> 10:52.140
Okay, shh.
Let's bring it down.

10:52.210 --> 10:54.280
Music's loud.
Not that loud.

10:54.350 --> 10:57.450
What if you just had sex
with men

10:57.520 --> 10:58.920
that were of legal age?

10:58.980 --> 11:01.720
- That's a great idea.
- I'm not gay, dude.

11:01.790 --> 11:03.490
You're offending me.

11:03.560 --> 11:05.690
Gay? You're not gay?
What, but you--

11:05.760 --> 11:07.430
I don't know, then.
I don't know, then.

11:07.490 --> 11:08.790
Okay, well,
you know what I know?

11:08.860 --> 11:09.930
Maybe actually you guys
aren't ready for

11:10.000 --> 11:11.060
the penthouse penthouse.

11:11.130 --> 11:12.430
Maybe that's what's up.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.070
Maybe you guys--
No, no, no--

11:14.130 --> 11:15.370
- you guys aren't dressed
up to standards

11:15.430 --> 11:17.070
because of your dorky
Canadian outfits.

11:17.140 --> 11:18.370
- These what?
- Maybe that.

11:18.440 --> 11:19.740
Maybe I should call--
hey, Vince. Come here.

11:19.810 --> 11:22.840
- No!
- We're cool, Vince.

11:22.910 --> 11:24.380
Yeah, hey, are we cool?

11:24.440 --> 11:25.880
- Yeah, we're good, man.
- Oh, oh, we're cool, Blake?

11:25.940 --> 11:27.040
- We're fine.
- Hey, you know what, Vince?

11:27.110 --> 11:28.610
We're good.
Let's chill out.

11:28.680 --> 11:31.150
Let's get some more drinks,
you got those coupons, right?

11:31.220 --> 11:32.520
Yes, that is what I'm saying.

11:32.580 --> 11:34.420
Then let's just make tonight
a tight butthole, dude.

11:34.490 --> 11:35.990
- Tight butthole.
- Tight butthole.

11:36.050 --> 11:37.260
Yeah.

11:37.320 --> 11:38.290
Well, you probably
shouldn't say it.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.620
No, I know, I was saying--

11:39.690 --> 11:41.230
but I'm just saying,
your guys' way.

11:41.290 --> 11:44.300
- Okay.
- Mm...

11:44.360 --> 11:45.700
Thank you, you guys.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.230
To know that those beliebers

11:47.300 --> 11:49.230
don't have to be bothered by
that creep anymore,

11:49.300 --> 11:50.900
it's a huge weight
off my shoulders.

11:50.970 --> 11:52.040
Yeah, I almost killed that guy.

11:52.100 --> 11:53.300
It was pretty dangerous.

11:53.370 --> 11:55.740
I stabbed him, like,
35 times in the face

11:55.810 --> 11:57.710
and body and neck area.

11:57.780 --> 11:59.240
And then,
they just took him to prison.

11:59.310 --> 12:00.650
He was bleeding everywhere
in the cop car.

12:00.710 --> 12:02.250
It was super sad.
Impressive.

12:02.310 --> 12:03.580
The streets are safe now,
Jillian.

12:03.650 --> 12:04.920
- Yeah.
- Everything's gonna be fine.

12:04.980 --> 12:06.920
You know what?
We had a good time doing it.

12:06.990 --> 12:08.550
Yeah, it was great.
It was very good.

12:08.620 --> 12:10.120
Well, I'll let
my little crime fighters

12:10.190 --> 12:12.320
get back to
the old superman cave.

12:12.390 --> 12:14.290
But, uh, out of curiosity,

12:14.360 --> 12:15.730
what did this creep look like?

12:15.790 --> 12:17.330
You know what?
Not creepy at all.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.200
Very normal.
Real hunk, actually.

12:19.260 --> 12:22.600
He had a dimple.
Uh, he was, uh...

12:22.670 --> 12:24.300
Had long blonde dreadlocks.

12:24.370 --> 12:25.540
He had, like,
a hook for a hand--

12:25.600 --> 12:27.240
- hey. I got lunches
for you guys.

12:27.310 --> 12:29.070
So, um--

12:29.140 --> 12:30.680
hey, who's that chick
right there?

12:30.740 --> 12:32.680
Um, Jillian.
Jillian, uh, Topher.

12:32.740 --> 12:34.180
Topher, Jillian.

12:34.250 --> 12:35.350
Hey, what up, I'm Topher.

12:35.410 --> 12:38.180
I'm friends with guys now.

12:44.920 --> 12:47.620
So, uh, how do you guys
know each other?

12:47.690 --> 12:49.960
- Oh, we know each other--
- No, we'll tell the story.

12:50.030 --> 12:51.090
- 'Cause it's funny.
- It's a good story.

12:51.160 --> 12:52.360
We'll tell it, we'll tell it.

12:52.430 --> 12:55.070
We met a little trick of fate
at--

12:55.130 --> 12:57.000
- softball rehearsal.
- Rehearsal.

12:57.070 --> 12:58.570
- Softball rehearsal.
- Yeah.

12:58.640 --> 13:00.940
You guys never told me that
you were in a play together.

13:01.010 --> 13:02.410
- Yeah.
- We're telling you now.

13:02.470 --> 13:04.540
Yeah, it was a huge--
it was a success.

13:04.610 --> 13:07.440
It was called <i>soft...</i>
<i>Pitch.</i>

13:07.510 --> 13:09.480
It was kind of like
<i>a league of their own,</i> but--

13:09.550 --> 13:11.150
- but with dudes.
- Yeah.

13:11.220 --> 13:12.880
- We're the dudes.
- Yeah, we're the dudes in it.

13:12.950 --> 13:14.080
Very similar.
Oh, okay.

13:14.150 --> 13:15.520
- I'm Geena Davis.
- Wow.

13:15.590 --> 13:17.750
Did I ever tell you guys
about my brief stint

13:17.820 --> 13:20.020
as a flying monkey
in <i>wicked</i>

13:20.090 --> 13:21.220
the the Toledo repertory
theater company?

13:21.290 --> 13:23.030
- No, you didn't tell us that.
- No?

13:23.090 --> 13:25.200
Okay, well, I'll tell you
in great detail.

13:25.260 --> 13:27.400
They called me harness bitch
the entire time

13:27.470 --> 13:28.930
which was cool and weird,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.200
so I was a little bit
50/50 on it.

13:31.270 --> 13:33.270
Oh, shoot. I gotta get that.

13:33.340 --> 13:34.500
Shucks.

13:34.570 --> 13:35.910
Right in the middle of
the good parts.

13:35.970 --> 13:38.640
- Man.
- Oh.

13:41.310 --> 13:44.550
That was funny.

13:44.620 --> 13:46.350
All right, Topher,
you know what?

13:46.420 --> 13:47.780
You cannot be here, man,

13:47.850 --> 13:50.350
because that girl is, like,
the main reason

13:50.420 --> 13:51.550
we <i>to catch a predator-ed</i>
you.

13:51.620 --> 13:52.820
Hey, you guys
seem like you have

13:52.890 --> 13:54.820
a really victorian attitude
towards sex.

13:54.890 --> 13:56.490
What do you think that
the '60s was all about, dude?

13:56.560 --> 13:58.560
Civil rights?

13:58.630 --> 14:00.360
Yeah, exactly,
civil rights, dude.

14:00.430 --> 14:02.830
Man, I'm sick of
getting persecuted and judged

14:02.900 --> 14:04.130
for being a sexual maven, man.

14:04.200 --> 14:06.070
I'm not gonna stand for that
anymore, man.

14:06.140 --> 14:09.410
Okay, yeah, all right.
Let's try an experiment.

14:09.470 --> 14:11.240
You love ten-year-old boys,
right?

14:11.310 --> 14:12.880
- 10 to 12.
- Okay.

14:12.940 --> 14:15.550
But what's the closest thing...

14:15.610 --> 14:18.450
To a ten-year-old boy?

14:18.520 --> 14:20.780
They're legal, they're female,

14:20.850 --> 14:22.620
they're flexible as hell.

14:22.690 --> 14:24.690
Right, I mean, it's perfect.
They're, like, 90 pounds.

14:24.760 --> 14:26.320
Plus, they don't menstruate.

14:26.390 --> 14:28.220
Yeah, and you're not even
the creepiest guy here.

14:28.290 --> 14:31.530
Check out this dude.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.260
Topher,
if you don't jump on them,

14:33.330 --> 14:35.370
I will quickly get busy
in that foam pit

14:35.430 --> 14:36.670
with all of them.

14:36.730 --> 14:39.600
I guess they're okay.
Like, from the back.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.000
All right, well, you know what?

14:41.070 --> 14:43.170
We're gonna hook you up
like you hooked us up, bud.

14:43.240 --> 14:46.880
Let's do this.
Let's do this.

14:46.940 --> 14:49.110
- No way.
- Oh, yeah.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.710
Hello, ladies.

14:50.780 --> 14:53.250
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.450
We are big fans of yours.
Nice short program.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.550
Ders.
Wow, that was rude, I'm sorry.

14:57.620 --> 14:59.120
I don't think
you're short at all.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.360
And our friend over there

15:00.420 --> 15:02.330
actually thinks
you're really attractive.

15:02.390 --> 15:03.430
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

15:03.490 --> 15:05.160
'Sup?

15:05.230 --> 15:06.730
- Oh, my God. He's hot.
- Yeah.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.260
He's, uh, he's actually single

15:08.330 --> 15:10.000
and looking for
an adult relationship

15:10.070 --> 15:12.370
with a, another adult.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.440
And if he doesn't choose
one of you,

15:14.510 --> 15:15.970
I'm also single.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.240
So if you guys
wanted to hang out,

15:17.310 --> 15:19.010
I can touch my toes,
I'm pretty flexible.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.410
Okay. Down boy!

15:20.480 --> 15:21.740
Uh, honestly, you should
give him a shot, though,

15:21.810 --> 15:25.680
'cause, uh...

15:25.750 --> 15:27.750
Where did he go?

15:27.820 --> 15:30.190
The boys' locker room.
Really?

15:30.250 --> 15:31.790
How could you bail on
that little sporty spice, dude?

15:31.860 --> 15:33.260
We had an experiment.

15:33.320 --> 15:34.360
Well, I was conducting
my own experiment in there.

15:34.430 --> 15:35.560
Check it out.

15:35.630 --> 15:36.660
God damn it, dude.

15:36.730 --> 15:38.090
Come on, man, nothing happened.

15:38.160 --> 15:39.460
Get the brunette.

15:39.530 --> 15:40.860
Okay, how can you
totally pull off a fedora

15:40.930 --> 15:42.130
and be such a creep
at the same time?

15:42.200 --> 15:43.230
Oh, I'm creepy again.
Right?

15:43.300 --> 15:44.530
Yes, you are, you're creepy.

15:44.600 --> 15:45.900
Okay, well, maybe you guys
are too good

15:45.970 --> 15:47.100
to get creepy over at
the penthouse penthouse.

15:47.170 --> 15:50.310
Come on, go get the underwear.

15:50.370 --> 15:52.040
Go get it.
Damn it!

15:52.110 --> 15:53.440
You got--
okay, go, go, go.

15:53.510 --> 15:54.780
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

16:01.950 --> 16:03.720
Body shot, still alive.

16:03.780 --> 16:05.180
Head shot.

16:05.250 --> 16:06.990
Hey, who wants to take over
for me?

16:07.050 --> 16:08.350
I gotta go check my emails.

16:08.420 --> 16:09.520
Where can I do that?
Right here.

16:09.590 --> 16:11.090
My, uh, laptop's right there.

16:11.160 --> 16:12.690
Oh, thanks, dude.

16:12.760 --> 16:17.430
You guys are awesome.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.030
Guys.

16:19.100 --> 16:21.130
We gotta end this.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.340
What? Dude, no.
Just two more days.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.470
Not until we go to the
penthouse penthouse, all right?

16:25.540 --> 16:27.870
You weren't leaning against
your girl's breasts like I was

16:27.940 --> 16:29.310
at club damnation.

16:29.380 --> 16:31.410
The penthouse penthouse
is a symbol

16:31.480 --> 16:33.610
that we've made it,
that we've arrived.

16:33.680 --> 16:35.010
We're this close to being cool.

16:35.080 --> 16:37.780
We're this close to seeing
pierced vaginas, Blake.

16:37.850 --> 16:39.850
And that's it for me.
I'll retire after that happens.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.150
Yeah.

16:41.220 --> 16:42.720
What don't you see about that,

16:42.790 --> 16:44.360
that you don't get it?

16:44.420 --> 16:45.860
Oh. It's Jillian.

16:45.930 --> 16:47.390
- Well, then answer the phone.
- Answer it.

16:47.460 --> 16:48.830
Think about someone else
for once.

16:48.900 --> 16:50.360
Pierced vaginas.

16:52.670 --> 16:54.530
- Hello.
- Hey, Blake, it's Jillian.

16:54.600 --> 16:57.440
Oh, hey, Jillian.
What's up, girl?

16:57.500 --> 16:58.640
Oh, nothing.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.010
Hey, I was just calling
to double check

17:00.070 --> 17:01.170
about that bieberhole guy.

17:01.240 --> 17:03.310
He's in jail, right?

17:03.380 --> 17:04.609
Oh, great, now she's asking
about Topher.

17:04.680 --> 17:06.780
- So just tell her about Topher.
- Lie to her.

17:06.849 --> 17:08.150
Why don't you lie to her?

17:08.210 --> 17:10.849
Why don't you be
a better friend and lie to her?

17:10.920 --> 17:14.849
Um, yeah, he's in jail.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.220
He's probably nestling up to
his cell mate right now.

17:17.290 --> 17:19.520
Hmm. Interesting.

17:19.589 --> 17:21.760
Uh, but you know
what confuses me,

17:21.829 --> 17:23.599
I just logged into
the chat room

17:23.660 --> 17:26.230
and a bieberhole69 asked me to

17:26.300 --> 17:28.900
"pull out my little boy
ding dong."

17:28.970 --> 17:33.200
What's even weirder
is that he has his webcam on

17:33.270 --> 17:37.710
and he looks just like
your friend from the other day.

17:37.780 --> 17:41.980
Even weirder, you guys
are standing right behind him.

17:42.050 --> 17:44.180
How do you explain that,
party boys?

17:44.250 --> 17:46.050
Ah, seriously, Jillian,

17:46.120 --> 17:47.520
it's, uh,
it's not our fault, it's--

17:47.590 --> 17:49.690
it's really a funny story,
actually.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.420
Look, I already called
the police.

17:51.490 --> 17:52.620
They're on their way.

17:52.690 --> 17:54.290
Don't let him go.

17:54.360 --> 17:55.860
Blake.

17:55.930 --> 17:58.330
You've gotta ask yourself,
are you a true belieber?

17:58.400 --> 18:01.700
I've believe you are.

18:05.740 --> 18:07.070
Hi, guys.

18:07.140 --> 18:10.040
Um, I've actually
gotta go do a bunch of errands

18:10.110 --> 18:11.980
right now, so--

18:12.040 --> 18:13.280
- you know we have to stop you.

18:13.350 --> 18:15.710
Yeah. Yeah.
It's cool.

18:15.780 --> 18:17.580
Let me just get my fedora on

18:17.650 --> 18:18.980
and throw all the vapetron
up in the air.

18:20.950 --> 18:22.620
Go. Go, man.

18:26.630 --> 18:27.830
What are you doing?

18:27.890 --> 18:29.160
Are you gonna help
or are you just gonna--

18:29.230 --> 18:30.460
- if I don't put away
our drug stuff,

18:30.530 --> 18:31.660
we're gonna go to prison
along with Topher.

18:31.730 --> 18:34.470
All right, good call.
Coming through.

18:34.530 --> 18:35.930
Here comes
the neighborhood watch,

18:36.000 --> 18:39.070
mother.

18:46.880 --> 18:50.050
Oh, yeah, baby!

18:50.120 --> 18:51.780
Topher.

18:51.850 --> 18:53.720
This spud's for you.

18:57.220 --> 18:58.220
- Oh!

18:58.290 --> 19:00.290
Ah!

19:00.360 --> 19:02.160
Adam, you idiot,
you dumb idiot.

19:02.230 --> 19:03.660
My bad.

19:03.730 --> 19:05.300
Wait, stay down.

19:05.360 --> 19:06.830
- What?
- Stay down!

19:06.900 --> 19:08.570
I'm gonna jump you.
No! No!

19:08.630 --> 19:10.400
Oh, no!

19:12.970 --> 19:14.270
Oh.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.510
- I trusted you.
- I'm so sorry.

19:18.580 --> 19:21.680
All right, guys.
Bros before hos.

19:21.750 --> 19:25.220
But, you know, little bros
before big bros.

19:33.430 --> 19:35.030
I don't understand.
How did you guys catch him?

19:35.090 --> 19:37.600
Topher's, like,
the fastest guy we've ever met.

19:37.660 --> 19:39.100
He's so fast.
He just--

19:39.170 --> 19:41.570
- we have cars.

19:41.630 --> 19:43.400
- Oh.
- Cars, okay, okay.

19:43.470 --> 19:44.600
Cool, good idea that we called.

19:44.670 --> 19:46.570
We thought of that,
but I just...

19:46.640 --> 19:47.840
You thought you could
get away with it?

19:47.910 --> 19:50.540
You!

19:50.610 --> 19:53.850
I will [Bleep] Your face.

19:53.910 --> 19:55.180
That's a promise.

19:55.250 --> 19:57.680
Take him away, boys.

19:57.750 --> 19:58.950
Jillian.

19:59.020 --> 20:00.950
Before you say anything,
we're sorry.

20:01.020 --> 20:02.320
He was, he was gonna take us

20:02.390 --> 20:03.560
to the penthouse penthouse.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.390
He's the coolest guy
we've ever met.

20:05.460 --> 20:07.390
Besides all that weird
little boy stuff.

20:07.460 --> 20:08.730
- Right.
- Yeah.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.460
We totally get it
if you never wanna talk to

20:10.530 --> 20:13.260
any of us ever again
in your whole life.

20:13.330 --> 20:14.970
Yeah, I get it.

20:15.030 --> 20:17.000
I mean, who wouldn't want to
go to the penthouse penthouse?

20:17.070 --> 20:18.440
You can pee on the floor.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.470
- Yeah, I know.
- That's real, right?

20:20.540 --> 20:22.710
- That's what we were saying.
- I'd tinkle all over the place.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.640
Hey, guys.

20:26.710 --> 20:27.710
Can I get a picture of you
for the paper?

20:27.780 --> 20:29.610
- Yes.
- Yes!

20:29.680 --> 20:31.280
- Yeah, all right.
- Of course you can.

20:31.350 --> 20:33.520
Wait, wait, can you give
the heroes a second?

20:36.690 --> 20:39.490
I tried to tell you guys.

20:45.130 --> 20:46.700
Hey, you're the guy
from the shirt, huh?

20:46.770 --> 20:50.030
Probably, man.

20:50.100 --> 20:51.800
Probably.
