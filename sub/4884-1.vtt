01:14:23.417 --> 01:14:24.959
and the person you really are.

01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:26.792
You're a bright girl, aren't you?

01:14:27.167 --> 01:14:28.375
Don't patronise me.

01:14:28.459 --> 01:14:29.500
Is that what you think I'm doing?

01:14:29.584 --> 01:14:31.167
I don't know what you're doing.

01:14:31.875 --> 01:14:32.875

01:15:06.042 --> 01:15:11.292

irregular periods or excessive bleeding?

01:15:11.375 --> 01:15:12.750
Do you ask everyone that?

01:15:13.167 --> 01:15:15.084
Just female patients, of course.

01:15:15.625 --> 01:15:17.417
It's important to have

01:15:17.875 --> 01:15:20.625

What do you feel, Lydia?

01:15:49.792 --> 01:15:50.875
Ill.

01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:53.417
No one wants the truth, do they?

01:15:54.084 --> 01:15:55.875
That does make me angry. Write that down.

01:15:57.292 --> 01:15:59.750
I think there's quite a lot going on
under that anger.

01:16:01.792 --> 01:16:03.209
It's racing.

01:16:05.042 --> 01:16:07.250
It's like it's gonna jump out.

01:16:07.334 --> 01:16:10.917
I resent this idea that
we're just emotional.

01:16:11.459 --> 01:16:12.542
This is real.

01:16:12.625 --> 01:16:14.625
It's real in its consequences, yes.

01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:17.834
What's important here is
that it's real to you.

01:16:17.917 --> 01:16:19.500
Real to me? What does that mean?

01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:21.542
It's real to all of us.

01:16:22.584 --> 01:16:24.750
Something's seriously wrong.

01:16:24.834 --> 01:16:26.709

01:16:46.209 --> 01:16:47.542
My advice?

01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:49.834
Don't take the pills.

01:16:51.125 --> 01:16:52.500
And try and hide your symptoms.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.834

01:16:54.917 --> 01:16:57.209

01:16:57.292 --> 01:16:58.792
that my symptoms
don't show as much anyway.

01:16:58.875 --> 01:17:01.917
- The advanced stages?
- Yeah, Connie.

01:17:03.125 --> 01:17:05.542
Being further along, I'm ahead.

01:17:05.917 --> 01:17:08.250
You just can't stand
that we're all feeling ill, too.

01:17:08.917 --> 01:17:11.625
No! I'm glad you're ill.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.417
Well, no, not glad, but
you know what I mean.

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:16.792
I'm gonna get my parents to arrange
for us to see a leading medical specialist.

01:17:16.875 --> 01:17:18.250

- Susie.

Hysterical contagion, that's the diagnosis.

The wandering womb.

01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:48.625
- Pardon?
- Hysteria.

01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:50.667
From the Greek for uterus.

01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:54.209

that the disordered womb led to hysteria.

I don't think you'll have much choice
but to come.

They'll ask lots of probing questions
about you, you know.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.959

in exactly why I am like I am.

having you as a mother?

01:22:23.875 --> 01:22:25.334
I wish to clarify

01:22:25.417 --> 01:22:28.584
that absolutely nothing
has been found in any tests

01:22:28.667 --> 01:22:30.792

01:22:31.542 --> 01:22:34.292
We have a reassuringly

is wilfully wrong.

01:29:26.459 --> 01:29:28.209
Get away from her!

01:29:28.292 --> 01:29:30.250
Go on, you get the hell away!

01:29:30.959 --> 01:29:33.084
Get out of my house! Get out!

01:29:33.167 --> 01:29:35.459
- Stop it!
- Get off me!

01:29:36.875 --> 01:29:38.417
Go on, get out of my house!

01:29:39.834 --> 01:29:41.000
Go on!

01:29:41.959 --> 01:29:44.334
Stop looking at her, I mean it!

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.709
You disgust me.

01:29:57.959 --> 01:29:59.750
You ought to be locked up.

01:30:00.667 --> 01:30:02.292
You're dangerous.

01:30:03.667 --> 01:30:04.750
I...

01:30:05.792 --> 01:30:09.125
I forgot he was my brother.

01:30:09.209 --> 01:30:10.584
(SCOFFS) You forgot?

01:30:12.792 --> 01:30:14.417
Oh, you've not been ill,

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.250
but you are sick and
you're sick in the head.

01:30:38.084 --> 01:30:40.417
There's not a man to be trusted.

01:30:43.709 --> 01:30:46.292
I know he went and left you,

01:30:46.375 --> 01:30:48.875
but you must have trusted him once.

01:30:49.625 --> 01:30:52.209
- I mean, you had two kids with him.
- One.

01:30:52.542 --> 01:30:54.625
Two. There's me, remember?

01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:55.834
- One.
- Two!

01:30:55.917 --> 01:30:57.625
- I can count.

01:30:58.542 --> 01:30:59.667
What?

01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:02.042
You're not his.

01:31:05.792 --> 01:31:06.917
(SCOFFS)

01:31:09.209 --> 01:31:10.709
That's why he ran away.

01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:15.542
Whose am I?

01:31:17.375 --> 01:31:19.667
- Forget it, it's history.
- It's my history.

01:31:20.375 --> 01:31:22.417
Who is he? Is he still alive?

01:31:23.417 --> 01:31:25.250
Oh, come on, you've got to tell me!

01:31:25.667 --> 01:31:27.084
Well, was there...

01:31:27.167 --> 01:31:29.125
Is there something wrong with him?

01:31:30.250 --> 01:31:32.584
There was, wasn't there?

01:31:35.542 --> 01:31:37.042
What's wrong with me? Who am I?

01:31:50.584 --> 01:31:52.334
He came from the shadows.

01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:55.625
What?

01:31:58.125 --> 01:31:59.625
And then he...

01:32:01.584 --> 01:32:02.709
He...

01:32:11.875 --> 01:32:12.959

01:32:48.167 --> 01:32:49.917
I've grown up

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.584
looking like him.

01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:53.709

01:32:54.584 --> 01:32:57.792
I always knew something was wrong.
Now I know.

01:32:58.709 --> 01:33:01.250
It was me. It's always been me.

01:33:03.625 --> 01:33:06.209

- I'm glad I know the truth.
