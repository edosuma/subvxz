WEBVTT

00:56.556 --> 00:57.974
Okay, are you ready?

00:58.141 --> 01:01.227
Yeah. I'm ready.

01:01.519 --> 01:04.230
I can't believe I'm gonna
do it with my babysitter.

01:05.565 --> 01:08.651
Ex-babysitter. Hunter, can you
not bring that up right now?

01:08.818 --> 01:11.654
- Sorry, sorry.
- It's okay.

01:11.821 --> 01:15.742
I think I popped your cherry on
Tuesday, so it shouldn't hurt too bad.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.828
Oh, okay, good.

01:21.748 --> 01:22.916
Are you okay?

01:24.542 --> 01:25.794
Keep going.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.810
Those are all Audrey's.

01:42.977 --> 01:44.396
It's a lot.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.398
That's mine.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.069
That's cool.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.912
Audrey lost it when
we were only like 15.

02:02.038 --> 02:04.749
She snuck in one night,
wasted on Zima...

02:04.916 --> 02:11.548
and was all like, "I just lost it while
we listened to 'Kiss From a Rose.'"

02:13.508 --> 02:15.385
I gotta jet.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.262
Trig quiz first period.

02:20.056 --> 02:22.100
Things aren't gonna
be weird now, right?

02:22.267 --> 02:24.728
No. I don't know.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.272
Okay. Yeah.

02:28.732 --> 02:32.027
So are we like boyfriend
and girlfriend now or...?

02:34.237 --> 02:37.240
You are so funny.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.244
Happy birthday.

02:56.968 --> 02:58.136
Pop.

03:29.626 --> 03:33.213
- Happy birthday, porcupine.
- Thank you, Daddy.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.317
You wanna fix that mouth.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.403
It's too...

03:57.112 --> 03:58.738
happy.

04:02.951 --> 04:07.080
I put the cake in the kitchen. Need some
hands getting the booze out the car.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.581
Let me take a look at you.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.792
Give me a little something.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.879
Oh, and happy birthday, you.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.714
I've got a present for you.

04:16.880 --> 04:19.384
I'm gonna take you to see
Rhonda at the salon.

04:19.551 --> 04:23.805
Take a yard or two off that hair, little
lipstick, you'll look just like Audrey.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.182
We are identical twins, May.

04:26.349 --> 04:31.730
Oh, I know, honey, but it's the details that
matter when it comes to roping in a fella.

04:50.081 --> 04:53.335
Happy birthday, LaLu.

05:00.508 --> 05:03.303
- Hey, Dad.
- Audrey.

05:06.806 --> 05:07.849
Anyway.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.811
You want your present?

05:15.857 --> 05:18.401
- "Audrey."
- So you'll always have me with you.

05:21.196 --> 05:22.655
Come here.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.242
Happy birthday.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.411
A dollhouse?

05:28.578 --> 05:30.747
No, look inside.

05:30.914 --> 05:34.376
- What is it?
- Hang on a second.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.885
Oh, my God.

05:44.052 --> 05:47.514
I can't believe it. Look at us.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.059
This is so brilliant.

05:51.226 --> 05:53.269
Just like you.

05:54.312 --> 05:57.691
It's so you can always feel
at home whenever you're away.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.527
Laurel, I love it.

06:13.957 --> 06:16.876
So how does it feel being
all grown up, ladies?

06:17.043 --> 06:18.211
Oh, it's great.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.172
Nobody really takes you
seriously in your early 20s.

06:21.339 --> 06:24.217
- It's much better for business.
- What sort of business?

06:24.384 --> 06:28.722
I work at a boutique real-estate company
that specializes in storybook homes.

06:29.305 --> 06:30.390
Come again?

06:30.557 --> 06:35.061
Houses that look like hobbit
holes or witches' dens or...

06:35.228 --> 06:37.814
People sure do like to
play pretend, I guess.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.399
What are you up to, Laurel?

06:39.566 --> 06:42.277
Still helping our dad with
those forgeries he makes.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.779
They're not forgeries,
they're copies.

06:44.946 --> 06:47.240
Oh, right. No, copies.
Yes, I'm sorry.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.076
Laurel's an amazing painter.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.747
I just finished a
cross-stitch of my Canoodle.

06:54.122 --> 06:58.001
- I'll have to bring it by before you leave.
- Yes, sure. That'll be great.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.627
Bye.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.505
- Happy birthday, ladies.
- Thank you.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.008
- Hunter.
- Hunter.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.677
Yeah. Are you a model now?

07:08.261 --> 07:09.346
No.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.557
You could easily be a model.

07:14.392 --> 07:18.772
Hunter, can I speak with you
for a moment in the kitchen?

07:20.315 --> 07:23.068
Yeah, sure. After you.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.904
Nice seeing you again.

07:28.740 --> 07:31.868
What is wrong, babe?

07:32.577 --> 07:36.581
Please don't look at my sister
like you wanna lick her face.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.249
Babe, Laurel.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.669
You know I only have eyes for you.

07:40.835 --> 07:44.422
Stop. Stop. You know
this isn't right...

07:44.589 --> 07:47.342
Hunter! What are you doing?

07:49.594 --> 07:51.846
That's your babysitter.

07:56.059 --> 07:58.603
Sorry, everybody, party's over.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.234
Laurel!

08:06.069 --> 08:08.613
Will you come down here, please?

08:24.045 --> 08:28.341
I just didn't wanna be
a virgin forever...

08:28.508 --> 08:31.928
waiting for some fairy-tale
guy who doesn't exist.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.222
You need to get out of this place.

08:36.057 --> 08:39.269
You're screwing a minor...

08:39.436 --> 08:42.397
and you act like Dad's wife, Laurel.
It's fucked.

08:42.563 --> 08:48.361
Hunter is almost 18. And I
don't act like Dad's wife.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.906
You cook for him,
you clean for him.

08:52.073 --> 08:55.577
And you wear all of our
dead mother's old clothes.

08:55.744 --> 08:59.039
I mean, do you even have
a dress of your own?

08:59.247 --> 09:02.334
Wearing her clothes makes me
feel like she's still around.

09:04.127 --> 09:09.007
- You've held on long enough, Laurel.
- Well, after Mom died, you just left.

09:09.174 --> 09:11.301
Somebody had to take
care of everything.

09:11.468 --> 09:14.220
Laurel, Dad is a grown man.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.972
He doesn't need you.

09:17.349 --> 09:20.268
He can't even get ice
cubes out of the trays.

09:23.688 --> 09:26.149
I'm really sorry for
ruining our birthday.

09:27.150 --> 09:29.235
I don't care about our birthday.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.904
I care about you.

09:31.071 --> 09:34.741
You deserve better than this.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.994
I want you to move in with me.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.249
Really?

09:54.052 --> 09:56.096
But he'll never let me go.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.849
I'm taking Laurel to
live with me, Dad.

10:04.396 --> 10:06.064
Okay.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.239
Good talk.

10:16.324 --> 10:20.078
I don't see the point in going with you.
My loser-ness is just...

10:20.245 --> 10:24.040
too painfully obvious
when I'm with you.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.545
Listen...

10:29.254 --> 10:31.464
we have the same DNA, Laurel.

10:33.216 --> 10:37.387
And despite the story
you've made up about me...

10:37.554 --> 10:40.890
- ...I don't have everything figured out.
- Yeah, right.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.102
You'll see.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.064
But what would I do?

10:48.898 --> 10:50.066
Paint.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.070
Dad's always fixing
my work, I can't.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.032
You're coming home with me...

10:57.198 --> 11:00.118
you're gonna do your own
painting, and that is that.

11:01.077 --> 11:05.206
But you cannot come home with me...

11:05.373 --> 11:08.376
with all of this coming
out of your head.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.962
- My hair?
- Yeah.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.048
Makeover.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.388
Who is Charles?

11:21.389 --> 11:22.390
No one.

11:23.725 --> 11:26.353
You didn't tell me you
were dating someone.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.813
I don't wanna talk about it.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.569
- Fire drill!
- No.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.238
Come on, don't be such an old lady!

11:38.782 --> 11:42.160
Laurel, you're gonna
miss your appointment.

11:44.079 --> 11:45.538
No.

11:59.469 --> 12:04.557
- I am going to go buy you a dress.
- Okay.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.727
So did you bring a
picture or something?

12:07.894 --> 12:09.729
Well, what do you wanna look like?

12:12.565 --> 12:14.484
Her, I guess?

12:15.777 --> 12:17.904
Okay, we'll give it a try.

12:19.114 --> 12:23.702
Laurel, they had pretty
slim pickings, but...

12:31.668 --> 12:34.879
Wait, are you guys twins?

12:37.799 --> 12:41.928
I like the dress so much,
it's really sweet.

12:44.514 --> 12:47.267
Look, I thought you wanted
me to be more like you.

12:47.434 --> 12:51.396
I want you to be like you, Laurel.

12:51.855 --> 12:52.897
Like you.

12:53.064 --> 12:58.945
I mean, I figured it looks good on you,
so it's gonna look all right on me.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.823
Dad is gonna freak out when
he sees you like that.

13:02.532 --> 13:06.286
I know, we haven't had the same
haircut since before Mom died.

13:10.582 --> 13:13.960
Seriously, I'm so glad no one
is around when we do that.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.255
So do I get to meet your boyfriend?

13:17.422 --> 13:21.426
- Fire drill!
- Hey, hey, no fair.

13:21.593 --> 13:24.012
Don't change the subject.

13:33.396 --> 13:36.608
- Hey, seat belts.
- Who needs a seat belt?

13:36.775 --> 13:38.151
I have a hair belt.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.666
Can you show me two fingers?

14:39.963 --> 14:41.715
My sister.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.425
She...

14:52.892 --> 14:54.436
She passed.

14:57.772 --> 15:00.734
You were in a head-on collision,
she was driving, you...

15:03.069 --> 15:05.572
You went through the windshield.

15:11.661 --> 15:12.996
Can I see her?

15:17.500 --> 15:19.919
There was a fire.
There's nothing to see.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.220
That's her.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.601
That's her!

15:37.187 --> 15:38.646
You're twins.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.273
That's you, Audrey.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.486
Audrey?

15:44.944 --> 15:47.155
That's your name.

15:47.572 --> 15:49.824
What's the last thing you remember?

15:58.375 --> 15:59.709
The party.

16:02.087 --> 16:04.798
Injuries like this, people lose
everything around the accident.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.384
When is she gonna
remember who she is?

16:07.550 --> 16:11.054
She has post-traumatic amnesia.
It's not structural or permanent.

16:11.221 --> 16:15.058
She should get her bearings in a few
days once the swelling goes down.

16:15.225 --> 16:16.893
We should monitor her closely.

16:17.060 --> 16:21.856
She could have lingering memory
problems, difficulty speaking....

16:42.210 --> 16:46.673
We'll bring her home after
supper, get her situated.

16:47.882 --> 16:51.094
I'm gonna make a Jell-O
mold for the reception...

16:51.261 --> 16:54.180
the kind with the
floating fruit in it.

16:54.889 --> 16:58.435
Laurel told me it made
her feel peaceful.

16:58.768 --> 17:02.897
It reminded her of
floating in outer space.

17:19.748 --> 17:22.876
May called your work to let
them know what happened.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.545
What do I do?

17:26.296 --> 17:29.049
You're in real estate, honey.

17:29.341 --> 17:30.717
I called Claudia.

17:30.884 --> 17:34.054
She's coming tomorrow
with her boyfriend.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.890
Claudia?

17:37.432 --> 17:39.517
Your best friend.

17:39.976 --> 17:42.312
You want me to call anyone else?

17:43.229 --> 17:44.731
No.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.236
I don't want her to come.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.573
I don't want anyone to come.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.539
Let us know if you need anything.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.876
We leave for the service
first thing in the morning.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.537
Laurel's funeral is this morning.

18:46.876 --> 18:48.545
Mama...

18:52.674 --> 18:55.010
I wish you were here.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.286
My funeral.

19:21.453 --> 19:25.373
Oh, no, no, no. My funeral...
My funeral is this morning.

19:25.749 --> 19:27.625
My funeral.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.255
Hi.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.507
How are you feeling this morning?

19:34.674 --> 19:37.927
- I'm not... I'm okay. I...
- That's just great.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.388
I was just telling your father...

19:40.555 --> 19:43.099
you've always been
a very strong girl.

19:43.266 --> 19:45.727
And I know it'll be rough going...

19:45.894 --> 19:48.855
but I just know you'll
find some way to triumph.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.774
- Thanks. I...
- And Laurel...

19:50.940 --> 19:53.068
she was such a strange little bird.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.903
Never got over your mama...

19:55.070 --> 19:58.740
and I just don't think she
could've got past losing you too.

19:58.907 --> 20:01.201
It's just better that
it happened this way.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.376
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:10.168 --> 20:12.337
I didn't mean to upset you.

20:12.504 --> 20:15.590
What was it you were
gonna tell us, honey?

20:18.093 --> 20:21.012
I just wanted to tell you
that I'm not really...

20:23.556 --> 20:25.600
I'm actually not...

20:29.270 --> 20:31.773
I'm just starting to remember
some things, and...

20:31.940 --> 20:34.401
That's just fantastic, honey.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.820
That's great news.

20:39.155 --> 20:40.198
Great.

20:40.365 --> 20:43.243
Yup, it's great, really great.

20:43.535 --> 20:45.328
Great news.

21:12.731 --> 21:17.318
Would anyone like to say a
few parting words to Laurel?

21:25.660 --> 21:28.788
A shared moment, perhaps?

21:30.415 --> 21:32.042
Anything?

21:33.335 --> 21:34.711
Frank?

21:41.217 --> 21:42.761
Audrey?

21:48.767 --> 21:50.894
It's too bad...

21:52.062 --> 21:56.066
that Laurel never got a chance
to get out of this place...

21:57.233 --> 22:00.445
since she clearly meant
shit to all of you people.

22:00.612 --> 22:02.572
And you know, it's
really too bad...

22:02.739 --> 22:08.244
that I was the only one who ever saw
anything special in her or believed in her.

22:09.579 --> 22:14.709
And now that she's gone, you
assholes can't hurt her anymore!

22:26.054 --> 22:30.100
What are you doing here? My parents
are gonna flip if they see you.

22:47.784 --> 22:50.787
I knew you knew. I knew you knew.

22:51.246 --> 22:52.706
I felt... I thought...

22:52.872 --> 22:54.708
I didn't know,
but I felt something.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.627
I just realized it this morning.

22:58.586 --> 23:01.548
I've been dreaming of this
moment since I was like 10.

23:03.383 --> 23:04.718
What?

23:06.094 --> 23:10.807
I.... I've been in love with you
since the fourth grade, Audrey.

23:11.808 --> 23:14.477
I mean, she looked like
you, but she wasn't...

23:14.644 --> 23:15.812
She wasn't you.

23:19.482 --> 23:21.901
I don't understand. You kissed me.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.738
You were her only friend.
She loved you.

23:26.072 --> 23:29.868
Well, yeah, but I liked her too.
Don't get me wrong.

23:30.035 --> 23:31.703
It's just that...

23:32.912 --> 23:34.080
You're...

23:34.247 --> 23:36.124
You're a goddess.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.182
Audrey.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.893
It's chilly out here, come inside.

23:55.060 --> 23:57.812
She took care of you
for all those years.

23:59.064 --> 24:00.774
How could you not say anything?

24:02.776 --> 24:04.402
- Let's take this inside.
- Yeah.

24:04.569 --> 24:07.030
"Let's take it inside.
Let's take it inside."

24:07.197 --> 24:10.158
God forbid we should ever say
anything about how we feel!

24:11.409 --> 24:14.496
Dad, say something.

24:15.330 --> 24:19.501
Right now. Just say something!

24:19.668 --> 24:21.711
Say something!

25:34.576 --> 25:36.578
I have to go back to work.

25:37.370 --> 25:38.997
In the shape you're in?

25:39.164 --> 25:42.083
I'll follow up with
my doctors at home.

25:42.250 --> 25:44.753
What should we do
with all her things?

25:44.919 --> 25:47.172
Donate them, I don't care.

25:47.339 --> 25:49.799
She didn't have anything anyway.

25:50.091 --> 25:51.384
Wait.

25:51.551 --> 25:53.636
I've got something for you.

26:03.688 --> 26:07.400
What about all those other paintings?
What are you gonna do with those?

26:08.777 --> 26:10.945
Which other paintings?

26:18.536 --> 26:20.580
These are all Laurel's.

26:21.331 --> 26:23.875
I couldn't send them to customers.

26:24.042 --> 26:26.044
They're not quite right.

26:27.295 --> 26:29.881
You can take as many
of them as you like.

26:30.048 --> 26:31.925
I can't use them.

26:35.345 --> 26:36.596
No, that's okay.

26:36.763 --> 26:39.724
I'll just take the one.

27:16.511 --> 27:18.471
Three fives.

27:19.222 --> 27:20.932
- You got a draw?
- Yeah.

27:21.099 --> 27:22.308
Good this far?

27:22.475 --> 27:24.561
I got three ones...

27:24.728 --> 27:28.064
but just because of that lucky
draw I was telling you about.

27:28.231 --> 27:31.609
- Then how about 10, 11, 12, 13?
- Great.

27:34.070 --> 27:36.239
Hey, what are you doing?

27:37.449 --> 27:39.909
Leave Basel alone.
He doesn't want to move out.

27:40.076 --> 27:42.746
Timor, I can handle this.
You want me to move out...

27:42.912 --> 27:45.498
pay me a move-out fee.
It's the way it works.

27:45.665 --> 27:48.710
- The law is on the tenant's side.
- Oh, you're my tenant.

27:50.253 --> 27:54.507
- Yeah.
- Sorry, I got in an accident.

27:54.674 --> 27:56.051
I....

27:56.217 --> 27:58.178
I have post-traumatic amnesia.

27:59.220 --> 28:02.557
I've never met a real-life amnesiac.
Cool.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.726
- Dinner!
- Oh, that's my mom.

28:04.893 --> 28:06.227
- Yup.
- Can I take this one?

28:06.394 --> 28:08.730
Yeah. You're gonna have
it back in two weeks?

28:08.897 --> 28:10.982
- I guess.
- All right. Perfect.

28:11.149 --> 28:12.776
Thanks, buddy.

28:12.942 --> 28:15.111
- Good playing.
- You too.

28:15.278 --> 28:17.822
- Bye.
- All right, bye.

28:21.368 --> 28:23.578
Why did I wanna kick you out?

28:24.537 --> 28:26.748
So your sister can move in here.

28:28.708 --> 28:30.585
- That was nice of me.
- It was.

28:30.752 --> 28:33.421
Except for when you called
me a creepy man-child...

28:33.588 --> 28:36.341
and tried to kick me out.
That was less nice.

28:37.050 --> 28:42.472
Well, so my sister will not be moving in
because of extenuating circumstances...

28:42.639 --> 28:44.933
so you don't have to leave.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.018
No, really?

28:47.185 --> 28:49.437
Oh, thank you, Audrey.

28:54.693 --> 28:55.944
Books.

28:56.778 --> 28:57.946
Yes, these are books.

28:59.072 --> 29:01.533
Yeah, I sell these books online...

29:01.700 --> 29:04.911
and I lend them to people in
the neighborhood, mostly kids.

29:05.078 --> 29:08.081
You wanna borrow one?
Help yourself.

29:08.540 --> 29:11.960
I broke my arm once,
so I can relate to that.

29:14.462 --> 29:17.882
Do you wanna sign
my cast, whatever?

29:19.050 --> 29:21.886
- You okay?
- Yeah, I mean you don't have to...

29:22.053 --> 29:23.680
No, no, please. I'd like to.

29:23.847 --> 29:26.683
I was thinking something like,
I don't know:

29:27.017 --> 29:30.020
"I hate you. Love, Basel."

29:30.186 --> 29:33.106
How about "I hate you.
Hate, Basel"?

29:33.273 --> 29:34.774
That's better. You improved.

29:36.985 --> 29:38.611
There you go.

29:42.949 --> 29:45.118
You okay? You seem
really different.

29:45.910 --> 29:47.996
I do? No.

29:48.163 --> 29:49.247
Like how?

29:49.414 --> 29:51.416
Well, you're being nice to me.

29:53.168 --> 29:54.294
Whatever.

29:56.546 --> 29:58.673
Audrey, that's your phone ringing.

29:59.883 --> 30:02.093
You should probably answer it.

30:02.385 --> 30:04.387
Right. Cool.

30:04.554 --> 30:05.597
Cool.

30:05.889 --> 30:07.390
Cool.

30:08.767 --> 30:10.977
- You live right over there.
- Right, okay.

30:31.748 --> 30:33.375
Hello?

30:35.752 --> 30:39.297
Hi, Charles. Charles.

30:39.464 --> 30:41.049
Hi.

30:42.884 --> 30:46.388
Yeah. I'm okay.

30:48.556 --> 30:50.600
Yeah, sure.

30:52.352 --> 30:56.398
Can you remind me what
our place is again?

31:00.026 --> 31:02.862
Okay. Great.

31:03.071 --> 31:07.075
I'll just remember that.
Yes, I'll see you there.

31:08.159 --> 31:10.412
I love you too.

31:11.830 --> 31:13.331
Bye.

31:39.232 --> 31:41.860
- It's me, Claudia.
- Come in.

31:42.152 --> 31:43.903
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

31:44.070 --> 31:46.239
Oh, my God.

31:46.406 --> 31:48.533
This was on the porch.

31:48.700 --> 31:50.035
Oh, sorry.

31:50.201 --> 31:51.745
I just talked to your dad.

31:51.911 --> 31:54.456
Do you remember me?
He said you might not.

31:54.831 --> 31:56.541
- No, yes, I remember.
- Okay, good.

31:56.708 --> 31:59.878
He said your phone melted
in the accident, literally melted.

32:00.045 --> 32:02.464
I made you my egg-white meringue.

32:02.630 --> 32:04.716
How are you? I mean
really, how are you?

32:04.883 --> 32:07.886
I'm okay. Yeah, you know,
a little turned around.

32:08.053 --> 32:09.596
Yeah.

32:09.763 --> 32:12.098
- Did you do something to your hair?
- No.

32:12.265 --> 32:16.061
- Just a... Yeah, a little trim.
- Yeah.

32:16.227 --> 32:17.771
Everyone in the office knows.

32:17.937 --> 32:21.399
Edith says take as much
bereavement as you need.

32:21.566 --> 32:23.526
You don't have to refrigerate that.

32:23.693 --> 32:25.987
What is that smell?

32:26.613 --> 32:28.448
I don't know.

32:29.074 --> 32:32.452
- Maybe the flowers.
- Yeah, okay.

32:35.413 --> 32:37.415
Whoa, yes.

32:40.502 --> 32:44.589
You know, I'm really great
to go back to work.

32:44.756 --> 32:47.550
I really want to, you know,
just get back to normal...

32:47.717 --> 32:49.678
I hear that.

32:50.136 --> 32:54.641
Back to normal, great idea, but maybe
you should consider not going back...

32:54.808 --> 32:58.311
until it looks like you didn't
just go through a windshield.

33:21.251 --> 33:23.336
They're so perfect they seem fake.

33:24.045 --> 33:26.715
It's like they're in
Technicolor or something.

33:27.549 --> 33:30.385
Don't know their real names,
so I call them The Browns.

33:30.552 --> 33:33.888
Mr. and Mrs. Brown, and
their kids, Dick and Jane.

33:34.055 --> 33:35.223
Dick and Jane, yeah.

33:35.390 --> 33:37.434
I didn't think of naming the kids.

33:37.600 --> 33:38.685
Right...

33:38.852 --> 33:42.063
Hey. We're just talking
about the Browns together.

33:42.897 --> 33:44.482
Fascinating.

33:44.649 --> 33:46.192
Okay, ready?

33:46.359 --> 33:47.402
Oh, sure.

33:47.569 --> 33:50.739
Do you want me to call Hortensia?
Get this place cleaned up?

34:03.043 --> 34:04.544
Audrey?

34:05.295 --> 34:06.629
Oh, yeah, hi.

34:06.796 --> 34:10.800
Yes, nice meeting you...
To see you.

34:10.967 --> 34:12.761
I'm so...

34:13.428 --> 34:16.097
so, so, so sorry.

34:16.764 --> 34:19.934
- I know how much she meant to you.
- You do?

34:26.065 --> 34:28.150
I think our table is ready.

34:46.878 --> 34:50.882
So this place is super
close to my apartment.

34:51.966 --> 34:53.426
Yes.

34:54.010 --> 34:55.719
Yes, it is.

34:58.390 --> 35:00.934
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.

35:01.184 --> 35:04.104
You know, I just don't
really feel like myself.

35:04.270 --> 35:06.606
I don't remember a lot of things.

35:08.191 --> 35:11.236
It's okay. We'll take it slow.

35:12.946 --> 35:16.783
I have to go to pee...
To the bathroom.

35:32.924 --> 35:35.802
- Darling, is everything all right?
- Yeah.

35:37.929 --> 35:38.972
Thank you.

35:50.191 --> 35:51.651
What's the matter?

35:52.193 --> 35:56.156
- You're not still mad at me, are you?
- No, it's not you. I mean....

35:56.322 --> 35:58.033
Why would I still be mad at you?

35:59.576 --> 36:03.038
Look, I'm sorry that I sprang a
divorce on you. Okay? I don't...

36:03.204 --> 36:05.582
- We're married?
- No, we're not married.

36:05.749 --> 36:08.376
So you are married to someone else?

36:08.543 --> 36:11.254
Audrey, just forget the divorce.
All right?

36:11.421 --> 36:13.757
We can go back to this
little farce of ours.

36:13.923 --> 36:16.634
I get it.
You're right, commitment is scary.

36:16.801 --> 36:20.096
- Did I break up with you?
- Yeah, but I know you didn't mean it.

36:20.555 --> 36:22.182
I'll go back to her.

36:22.349 --> 36:26.561
And you and I can... We'll just pretend
that none of this ever happened.

36:26.728 --> 36:30.899
So wait, what, you would
just be with both of us?

36:32.484 --> 36:34.361
That's what you want, isn't it?

36:37.405 --> 36:39.908
I don't wanna be
someone's mistress.

36:40.075 --> 36:42.577
I don't wanna be
someone's second choice.

36:43.244 --> 36:45.830
I deserve better than that.

36:46.122 --> 36:47.749
Audrey.

36:49.084 --> 36:51.544
Wait. Audrey!

36:53.046 --> 36:55.465
Leave me alone!

36:56.216 --> 36:58.718
- Audrey.
- Go pay our check!

36:58.885 --> 37:01.179
I don't understand what's...

37:02.555 --> 37:06.851
Audrey. Goddamn it. Open up the door.
You're acting like a child.

37:07.018 --> 37:09.562
Go away, okay?
Or I'm gonna call the police.

37:09.729 --> 37:12.399
- Can we talk about this like adults?
- Go away.

37:12.565 --> 37:16.653
No. You're not my second choice.
Why do you think I want a divorce?

37:16.820 --> 37:20.156
- I'm trying to make this real.
- Audrey, is everything all right?

37:20.323 --> 37:22.117
- Basel, is that you?
- Yes.

37:22.283 --> 37:24.911
- Can you make him go away?
- I'm not gonna go away.

37:25.078 --> 37:27.747
- Open the door.
- She said she wants you to go away.

37:27.914 --> 37:29.582
This really doesn't concern you.

37:29.749 --> 37:32.252
Oh, it kind of does
because she asked you...

37:32.419 --> 37:33.753
Hey, don't kick her door.

37:34.295 --> 37:36.214
Let's be gentlemen. Let's call her.

37:36.381 --> 37:37.882
It'll make this...

37:39.718 --> 37:42.554
Would you mind
your own business, pal?

37:48.143 --> 37:50.645
What did you punch me
in the face for, man?

37:50.812 --> 37:53.273
You son of a bitch.

38:05.410 --> 38:08.830
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Oh, I'm sure he'll be just fine.

38:08.997 --> 38:10.331
Oh, my God, are you okay?

38:10.498 --> 38:13.543
Your boyfriend just accidentally
punched me in the face.

38:13.710 --> 38:15.545
- I guess it's funny.
- I'm sorry.

38:15.712 --> 38:19.341
Come in. I have, like,
Band-Aids, I think, and stuff.

38:19.507 --> 38:21.926
It's a huge overreaction
by that guy.

38:22.093 --> 38:24.888
I know. I'm sorry.
He's not really my boyfriend.

38:25.055 --> 38:28.975
I'm really sorry about the mess.
I just didn't know what to wear.

38:29.142 --> 38:32.896
Well, I'm just judging with
my one good eye anyhow.

38:47.452 --> 38:48.703
Oh, fuck.

38:49.662 --> 38:50.914
No, no, no.

38:51.081 --> 38:52.415
Oh, no.

38:54.042 --> 38:56.544
Oh, no, no, no. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

38:56.711 --> 38:58.546
Oh, you fucking idiot.

39:00.256 --> 39:02.884
I have all this stuff.

39:04.260 --> 39:07.222
Sorry. I was looking at it
and then blood spilled on it.

39:11.476 --> 39:13.228
I didn't mean to.

39:13.395 --> 39:17.565
- Can I get a towel or something?
- Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

39:17.941 --> 39:20.193
- Let me tilt your head back.
- Sure.

39:20.360 --> 39:22.737
- I really just need one of these.
- Okay.

39:22.904 --> 39:23.988
Thanks.

39:24.906 --> 39:27.325
I think it's really good.
The painting.

39:27.492 --> 39:31.079
Oh, no, it's not.
I just... I didn't even finish it.

39:31.246 --> 39:35.250
I'm serious. I think it's really good.
I think it's better than the original.

39:35.875 --> 39:38.753
I mean it. She's got,
like, bigger secrets.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.047
Looks like she's got
plans for the weekend.

39:41.756 --> 39:44.300
Yeah. I don't know.
I was gonna throw it away.

39:44.467 --> 39:45.885
Throw it away? Well....

39:46.052 --> 39:50.181
Considering it's our first collaboration,
with my blood and all, can I keep it?

39:51.099 --> 39:52.767
Sure. I mean, if you want.

39:52.934 --> 39:55.145
Well, I'll take it. Thanks.

39:56.396 --> 39:57.605
How's your arm?

39:57.772 --> 39:59.983
It must've been a
pretty gnarly accident.

40:00.150 --> 40:01.568
Yeah.

40:02.068 --> 40:03.945
Yeah, it was.

40:07.032 --> 40:09.034
My sister...

40:09.701 --> 40:13.121
died in it, the accident.

40:15.373 --> 40:17.208
Fuck, Audrey. I didn't...

40:19.878 --> 40:22.088
Was she older than you
or younger than you?

40:23.214 --> 40:24.674
Younger...

40:24.841 --> 40:27.218
by two minutes.

40:27.886 --> 40:30.680
Your twin sister died?

40:30.847 --> 40:33.725
- Oh, fuck.
- Yeah.

40:34.059 --> 40:35.226
Laurel.

40:36.227 --> 40:39.230
Did I ever tell you about her?

40:39.397 --> 40:42.192
No, you never told me about her.

40:42.359 --> 40:44.778
We've never actually
talked, Audrey.

40:44.944 --> 40:47.238
It's a miracle that
I'm sitting here now.

40:47.405 --> 40:50.325
- I'm sorry.
- No, you don't... That came out wrong.

40:50.492 --> 40:52.994
You don't have to be sorry.
Your twin just died.

40:53.161 --> 40:55.121
You never have to be sorry
for anything again.

40:55.288 --> 40:58.416
So like a free pass to just
be, like, a horrible person?

40:58.583 --> 41:00.669
Sure.
You could be raping and pillaging.

41:00.835 --> 41:03.046
- I'd probably forgive you for it.
- Great.

41:03.922 --> 41:05.090
When my grandma died...

41:05.256 --> 41:08.468
She raised me, meant everything to me.
I freaked out.

41:08.635 --> 41:11.888
I got drunk all the time,
just waggled my dick around.

41:12.055 --> 41:13.723
Just looked for trouble.

41:17.852 --> 41:21.439
What was she like? Your sister?
If you don't mind talking about it.

41:24.943 --> 41:26.653
Laurel...

41:28.279 --> 41:29.739
lived at home still.

41:29.906 --> 41:32.826
She took care of our dad.

41:33.618 --> 41:37.747
We come from this
really small town.

41:37.914 --> 41:42.585
People thought, you know, pretty
much thought she was a weirdo.

41:42.752 --> 41:44.462
I was kind of her only friend.

41:44.629 --> 41:47.007
Well, everybody thinks
I'm really weird.

41:47.173 --> 41:51.428
But I'm not. I'm actually fucking
really smart and talented.

41:51.594 --> 41:53.888
So that's probably
how your sister is too.

41:54.055 --> 41:56.599
Do you do that a lot?

41:56.850 --> 41:58.143
Compliment yourself.

41:58.309 --> 42:00.812
- Doesn't everybody?
- No, I don't think so.

42:01.062 --> 42:05.942
I think everybody pretty much just tells
themselves they suck all the time.

42:06.109 --> 42:07.402
Well, then I dare you.

42:07.902 --> 42:10.113
Oh, yeah, to what?

42:10.280 --> 42:12.991
What do you think?
To compliment yourself.

42:15.618 --> 42:17.328
Okay.

42:18.997 --> 42:22.250
Okay. I am... I am really....

42:24.419 --> 42:26.212
I am really small.

42:28.923 --> 42:31.926
That is the worst
compliment I've heard.

42:32.093 --> 42:33.386
That's a fact.

42:33.553 --> 42:36.222
That's not a compliment,
but it's a start.

42:36.389 --> 42:37.932
We got a start, Audrey.

42:38.099 --> 42:39.517
All right.

42:39.684 --> 42:42.854
Here. Were you serious
about this painting?

42:43.021 --> 42:46.232
Or was that what people say when
you bleed on their painting?

42:46.399 --> 42:49.402
- Yeah, you can take that if you want it.
- I want to.

42:49.569 --> 42:52.697
No, no, no. It's okay.
Thanks for everything.

42:52.864 --> 42:55.075
- Thanks for defending me.
- You got it.

42:55.241 --> 42:56.785
Hey...

42:58.286 --> 43:00.538
we should hang out
sometime, you know?

43:00.705 --> 43:02.999
Oh, yeah. I mean....

43:03.166 --> 43:05.710
You mean like a date or...?

43:06.211 --> 43:07.379
No, just as friends.

43:07.545 --> 43:09.631
Oh, yeah, right. Friends. Cool.

43:09.798 --> 43:16.012
Anyway, I've got this thing that I
was in the middle of doing and...

43:18.765 --> 43:20.392
What the...?

44:07.731 --> 44:10.525
Audrey, darling.

44:10.692 --> 44:12.902
I am so sorry for your loss.

44:13.069 --> 44:15.613
I can't imagine what
you've been through.

44:15.780 --> 44:18.742
Oh, thank you.

44:19.325 --> 44:20.744
- Edith.
- Edith.

44:20.910 --> 44:22.996
Take as much time as you need.

44:23.163 --> 44:25.707
And let me know if I can
do anything for you.

44:25.874 --> 44:26.875
- Anything.
- Great.

44:27.042 --> 44:29.711
We're actually on our way
to show some properties.

44:29.878 --> 44:33.298
Wonderful. We need her back in
action as soon as we can get her.

44:33.465 --> 44:34.758
Come.

44:42.223 --> 44:44.059
All right.

44:45.518 --> 44:47.312
Let's do this.

44:56.654 --> 44:57.906
All right.

44:58.573 --> 45:01.326
The empty ones are always
the hardest to sell.

45:01.493 --> 45:03.495
Oh, yeah, totally.

45:05.288 --> 45:07.665
- Are you all right?
- I'm cool.

45:07.791 --> 45:10.251
Okay. It's second nature.

45:10.418 --> 45:13.546
You just point out the good
stuff, minimize the bad.

45:13.713 --> 45:16.716
Pitch them on a future life
where their dreams come true.

45:16.883 --> 45:20.387
They either like it or not, and
you do the fucking paperwork.

45:20.553 --> 45:22.138
Okay.

45:22.305 --> 45:23.556
Okay.

45:23.723 --> 45:26.267
- You're gonna be great.
- Great.

45:26.434 --> 45:28.061
All right.

45:28.645 --> 45:30.230
- Hi, Mrs. Matthews.
- Hello.

45:30.397 --> 45:32.315
- Come in.
- Thank you.

45:32.482 --> 45:33.525
- David.
- Hi.

45:33.692 --> 45:35.485
- Darren.
- Oh, my stars.

45:35.652 --> 45:39.531
- What happened to you?
- Oh, I got in an accident.

45:39.698 --> 45:42.951
- I'm fine.
- Oh, well....

45:43.535 --> 45:45.412
So....

45:47.414 --> 45:51.710
So this is the...

45:53.211 --> 45:55.046
living room.

45:59.551 --> 46:02.178
Over there is a...

46:02.345 --> 46:03.388
little door.

46:11.896 --> 46:13.857
I'm sorry.

46:14.941 --> 46:16.067
I froze.

46:16.234 --> 46:18.778
I'm gonna figure it out, I promise.
Please.

46:18.945 --> 46:20.572
Just don't be mad at me.

46:20.739 --> 46:23.241
I'm not mad at you.

46:23.783 --> 46:26.119
I just don't know what
is going on with you.

46:26.286 --> 46:27.787
That's not you.

46:27.954 --> 46:32.125
I got nervous.

46:44.137 --> 46:47.557
There's like this whole community
for twins whose twin died...

46:47.724 --> 46:51.102
and, okay, they have
these support groups.

46:51.269 --> 46:54.397
I got you some brochures, here.

47:06.910 --> 47:09.287
Why did you get me so many?

47:14.042 --> 47:15.377
Hey, Audrey.

47:16.211 --> 47:19.255
This is the girl I told you about,
the one who has amnesia.

47:19.422 --> 47:20.715
- Hi.
- Hi.

47:23.385 --> 47:25.470
- What?
- Nothing.

47:25.637 --> 47:29.182
Basel thinks you're prettier now
that you stopped being a beyotch.

47:29.349 --> 47:31.685
- Peter.
- Someone's gotta have some balls.

47:31.851 --> 47:33.436
He said that? Really?

47:33.603 --> 47:36.356
Do you "like" like him?

47:36.523 --> 47:38.233
No.

47:41.236 --> 47:42.237
What are you doing?

47:42.404 --> 47:43.446
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

47:43.613 --> 47:44.656
What did you say?

47:44.823 --> 47:45.865
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

47:46.032 --> 47:47.200
What did you guys say?

47:47.367 --> 47:48.410
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

47:48.576 --> 47:50.829
Why you guys talking
at the same time again?

48:09.597 --> 48:11.057
No.

48:44.507 --> 48:45.884
No, don't go.

48:49.387 --> 48:51.139
Don't leave.

49:01.858 --> 49:03.401
Hello?

49:03.735 --> 49:05.487
<i>Hello?</i>

49:06.363 --> 49:09.741
Hi, Daddy. I mean, Dad.

49:13.244 --> 49:16.081
May and I are getting married
at the end of the month.

49:17.082 --> 49:19.959
<i>It's just a little
courthouse thing...</i>

49:21.294 --> 49:23.880
<i>so we'd like you to come
be our witness.</i>

49:27.217 --> 49:33.181
Don't you think it's a little
soon, Dad? I mean...

49:34.224 --> 49:36.309
<i>she just died.</i>

49:36.476 --> 49:40.980
Life's too short to
wait any longer.

49:41.856 --> 49:44.150
I've been alone a long time.

49:45.902 --> 49:47.654
Dad?

49:50.281 --> 49:51.991
It's just...

49:53.493 --> 49:56.246
you know, I get to
painting in the morning...

49:57.956 --> 50:01.584
and I realize I'm
just really hungry.

50:02.377 --> 50:04.546
I'm waiting for her to
come bring me breakfast.

50:07.215 --> 50:13.555
<i>She used to smash raspberries
down on the toast, you know?</i>

50:13.722 --> 50:16.725
<i>- She said that...</i>
- Jam is too sugary.

50:16.891 --> 50:19.227
Yeah, yeah.

50:22.731 --> 50:25.442
- Dad.
- Frank.

50:30.613 --> 50:32.574
<i>- Dad.</i>
- Yeah?

50:39.330 --> 50:40.957
Nothing.

50:42.125 --> 50:45.545
Look, I know we haven't
talked since....

50:45.712 --> 50:49.382
But now that's... We're all that's
left of our little family, you know?

50:50.133 --> 50:53.136
<i>You know, maybe we should
try to talk sometimes.</i>

50:53.303 --> 50:54.971
Sure, Dad.

50:55.805 --> 50:57.682
Frank.

50:58.099 --> 51:00.226
I gotta go, okay?

51:00.393 --> 51:02.604
I gotta go. I gotta go.

51:29.255 --> 51:34.260
I think that that's something that James
has been struggling with as well. So....

51:34.427 --> 51:35.720
Hi, welcome.

51:35.887 --> 51:37.972
Come join us, please.

51:38.139 --> 51:39.724
Hi.

51:46.773 --> 51:49.651
New members usually start
by introducing themselves.

51:49.818 --> 51:51.236
Would you like to do that?

51:52.737 --> 51:55.323
My name is Laurel... Audrey.

51:55.490 --> 51:57.742
Hi, Laurel Audrey.

51:57.909 --> 52:00.120
Welcome to Twins Without Twins.

52:00.286 --> 52:03.081
Would you like to tell
us what you're feeling?

52:05.792 --> 52:07.419
I'm...

52:09.546 --> 52:14.300
just having a hard time...

52:15.802 --> 52:18.638
letting go of my sister.

52:19.431 --> 52:21.808
I think we all know how that feels,
right?

52:21.975 --> 52:23.059
- Yes.
- Yeah.

52:23.226 --> 52:24.477
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

52:25.103 --> 52:27.647
Would you like to tell us more
about your twin...

52:27.814 --> 52:31.443
or the different emotions that
you've been going through?

53:33.004 --> 53:34.506
Hey.

53:35.298 --> 53:36.591
Oh, hey.

53:36.758 --> 53:38.593
Did they say you could do that?

53:38.760 --> 53:41.846
No, they didn't. Come on in.

53:43.181 --> 53:44.599
I can't.

53:44.766 --> 53:46.643
So what?

53:48.728 --> 53:50.730
Hang on.

54:22.887 --> 54:25.557
- Nice work.
- Thank you.

54:25.724 --> 54:26.933
Well, come on in.

54:27.100 --> 54:29.310
You've already done the hard part.

54:29.477 --> 54:32.731
I'd take the stairs,
it's the easiest way in.

54:32.897 --> 54:34.399
- Is it okay?
- It's cold.

54:34.566 --> 54:37.068
Yeah, they don't heat it
when they're gone.

54:39.362 --> 54:42.198
Yeah, just commit to
it, just jump in.

54:42.365 --> 54:44.242
It's super terrible but just do it.

54:55.879 --> 54:57.881
Nice job.

54:58.173 --> 55:00.091
- It's cold, right?
- Yeah.

55:00.258 --> 55:03.845
- Well, I'm glad you did it.
- Yeah.

55:04.012 --> 55:05.889
I think...

55:06.890 --> 55:09.059
I think I might....

55:10.810 --> 55:14.481
Well, thank you for joining me for
this midnight swim, Mrs. Brown.

55:16.066 --> 55:17.484
What?

55:18.234 --> 55:22.572
It's kind of easier if we just pretend
we're married and this is our pool.

55:23.573 --> 55:25.867
Mr. Brown...

55:26.451 --> 55:30.705
you've done such a beautiful job
keeping this pool nice and clean.

55:30.872 --> 55:34.042
Well, Mrs. Brown, you know,
I do everything I can.

55:34.209 --> 55:36.795
I shouldn't have fired
the heating guy.

55:36.961 --> 55:41.383
You know me, Mrs. Brown, I think
I can do everything myself.

55:42.634 --> 55:44.260
I think...

55:44.844 --> 55:48.807
I'm gonna need your help with
the children in the morning.

55:48.973 --> 55:50.016
For the bake sale?

55:50.183 --> 55:54.479
Yeah, because we've gotta raise
some money for the rainforest.

55:54.646 --> 55:58.233
Oh, absolutely. That's a big concern
of Dicky and Janey.

55:58.400 --> 56:01.236
And maybe you could pack their
lunches in the morning.

56:01.403 --> 56:05.240
I'll pack their lunch, put a note in
there, tell them how much I adore...

56:05.407 --> 56:07.409
Their mother?

56:09.452 --> 56:10.912
Yeah.

56:12.706 --> 56:14.624
And then, you know...

56:15.750 --> 56:18.503
after school we can...

56:18.670 --> 56:23.758
you know, take them
to the playground and....

56:50.994 --> 56:52.746
How do you take this thing off?

56:52.912 --> 56:54.873
Just break it.

57:05.342 --> 57:08.219
- Oh, my God.
- No, not...

57:08.386 --> 57:10.722
- Am I doing something wrong?
- No, you're not.

57:10.889 --> 57:12.265
- What am I doing?
- Nothing.

57:12.432 --> 57:13.975
Just say it.

57:15.226 --> 57:18.063
I like it when you touch me.
That was it.

57:19.022 --> 57:21.775
- You did?
- I do, that was....

57:22.067 --> 57:26.237
Even when I touch you in your ear?

58:04.442 --> 58:06.736
- Beep.
- Beep.

58:09.280 --> 58:10.615
Beep.

58:22.961 --> 58:24.421
Thanks.

58:24.713 --> 58:26.464
I feed you.

58:54.868 --> 58:56.494
Audrey.

58:59.581 --> 59:01.166
Audrey.

59:07.005 --> 59:09.257
Audrey, are you here?

59:16.598 --> 59:18.350
Audrey.

59:23.938 --> 59:26.066
Audrey, come on.

59:39.704 --> 59:41.790
What do you wanna order, Mr. Brown?

59:41.956 --> 59:45.043
- Would you like to split something?
- I suppose, Mr. Brown.

59:45.210 --> 59:47.087
- Does that sound good?
- Sounds good.

59:47.253 --> 59:50.507
- Seriously?
- It's so crazy that your twin died.

59:52.092 --> 59:54.844
Elvis' twin died at birth.
He never got over it.

59:55.011 --> 59:57.389
- Jesus, Patrick.
- What? It's true.

59:57.555 --> 01:00:00.475
You have the subtlety
of a monster truck.

01:00:00.642 --> 01:00:02.602
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

01:00:02.769 --> 01:00:05.188
- Yeah, he totally killed himself.
- Dude.

01:00:05.355 --> 01:00:08.191
What is...? Everybody
knows Elvis died.

01:00:09.401 --> 01:00:11.069
Oh, God.

01:00:14.406 --> 01:00:18.076
She shouldn't be
having so much fun.

01:00:18.243 --> 01:00:19.786
I mean, it's not right.

01:00:19.953 --> 01:00:21.579
It's not right to have fun?

01:00:21.746 --> 01:00:24.249
No, not when you're
mourning your twin sister.

01:00:24.416 --> 01:00:27.627
What, you want her wearing black
and wailing all the time?

01:00:27.794 --> 01:00:30.338
Yeah. No.

01:00:30.505 --> 01:00:32.215
But she doesn't...

01:00:32.757 --> 01:00:35.885
She seems different, doesn't she?

01:00:36.052 --> 01:00:38.763
- She's still hot.
- Oh, fuck you, Patrick.

01:00:41.099 --> 01:00:42.559
Hey, Mrs. Brown.

01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:46.646
It's time to wake up if we're
gonna beat the crowds.

01:00:46.813 --> 01:00:50.567
But who's gonna watch the kids?

01:00:50.984 --> 01:00:52.610
Come on.

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:03.223
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:07.227
She's out back painting if you want her.
You can walk through my place.

01:02:07.394 --> 01:02:10.397
- I actually need to talk to you.
- To me?

01:02:12.482 --> 01:02:14.275
Well, what have I done?

01:02:15.276 --> 01:02:17.320
Does she ever...?

01:02:18.113 --> 01:02:20.782
- Does she talk to you about Laurel?
- Yeah, a lot.

01:02:20.949 --> 01:02:22.117
That is... Yeah.

01:02:22.283 --> 01:02:24.828
She won't talk to me and
I wanted to make sure...

01:02:24.994 --> 01:02:27.747
- ...that someone was here for her...
- Well, I'm here.

01:02:27.914 --> 01:02:29.124
I got it.

01:02:30.417 --> 01:02:31.793
Okay.

01:02:32.794 --> 01:02:35.046
You know, she seems
perfect but she's not.

01:02:35.213 --> 01:02:37.716
Usually she has her guard up, okay?

01:02:37.882 --> 01:02:40.927
She wants everyone to believe
she's got it all together...

01:02:41.094 --> 01:02:43.513
but with you, she's
let her guard down.

01:02:44.681 --> 01:02:47.600
If you break her heart, I will
fucking murder your face.

01:02:47.767 --> 01:02:51.730
- Definitely. Thanks for talking to me.
- I don't get it.

01:02:51.896 --> 01:02:55.108
Just a few weeks ago, we
were making fun of your B.O.

01:02:57.277 --> 01:02:59.487
Thanks for stopping by.

01:03:18.006 --> 01:03:20.967
How come you don't ever talk
about your sister with me?

01:03:22.844 --> 01:03:25.513
You know, everything
is so great with us.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:27.515
Come on, cool it with that.

01:03:28.308 --> 01:03:32.062
What do you think, if you show me how
you feel, I'm not gonna like you?

01:03:32.228 --> 01:03:34.647
- Yeah, maybe.
- Really?

01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:37.942
This isn't gonna last
if it's like that.

01:03:38.109 --> 01:03:41.529
If this is real, we gotta tell
each other the bad stuff.

01:03:41.696 --> 01:03:46.743
And if this isn't real, if this
is just my kind of imagination...

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:48.328
then I wanna know now.

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:57.712
I don't know what I'm doing.
I have never done this before.

01:03:59.547 --> 01:04:01.299
I don't...

01:04:01.466 --> 01:04:04.552
I don't even know what
the real me looks like.

01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:07.430
- Well, I think I do.
- Really?

01:04:07.597 --> 01:04:08.932
Yes, I do.

01:04:09.099 --> 01:04:11.267
She's funny and she's weird...

01:04:11.434 --> 01:04:15.230
and likes to play games
and she makes me laugh.

01:04:15.939 --> 01:04:18.566
I think that's the real you.

01:04:20.985 --> 01:04:22.904
I like her.

01:04:24.155 --> 01:04:26.032
That's who I want.

01:04:27.033 --> 01:04:29.035
That's what I want.

01:04:30.537 --> 01:04:34.124
So this is my favorite
feature of the house.

01:04:36.042 --> 01:04:41.339
I thought it would make a great little
clubhouse for your kids someday.

01:04:42.424 --> 01:04:46.386
- I'm never gonna be able to get in there.
- But I can.

01:04:48.054 --> 01:04:51.558
No, I'm definitely not
gonna fit in there.

01:04:51.725 --> 01:04:53.518
- Isn't this awesome?
- I love it.

01:04:55.061 --> 01:04:58.064
Here is the yard.

01:04:58.231 --> 01:05:00.942
Now, you said you like to cook.

01:05:01.192 --> 01:05:05.196
I was thinking you could plant a little
vegetable garden right over there.

01:05:05.363 --> 01:05:07.615
And eat the harvest
every year as a family.

01:05:07.782 --> 01:05:09.492
I'm so excited to show you this.

01:05:09.659 --> 01:05:12.996
There's a beautiful place you'll
really love to put a swing.

01:05:13.163 --> 01:05:15.331
I like swinging.

01:05:15.498 --> 01:05:17.792
- Happy hour after?
- Of course.

01:05:17.959 --> 01:05:21.087
- I'll get started on the agreement.
- Get those papers, girl.

01:05:21.254 --> 01:05:22.297
I know.

01:05:22.464 --> 01:05:24.841
- So proud of you.
- Thank you.

01:05:44.736 --> 01:05:46.696
Hi, sir.

01:05:46.863 --> 01:05:48.740
What are you doing here?

01:05:49.407 --> 01:05:51.368
- Hi, dear.
- Hi.

01:05:51.534 --> 01:05:54.913
- How's everything going?
- It's great.

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.832
Guess what? I just got an
offer on the new storybook.

01:05:57.999 --> 01:06:00.251
Fantastic.

01:06:00.418 --> 01:06:02.796
Audrey is recovering
from a nasty accident.

01:06:02.962 --> 01:06:04.005
Terrible.

01:06:04.172 --> 01:06:06.132
He's not a client, he's my ex.

01:06:06.299 --> 01:06:07.801
I think we should get going.

01:06:07.967 --> 01:06:10.553
The appointment... We don't
wanna be late for that.

01:06:20.146 --> 01:06:22.357
And we can discuss this in the car.

01:06:24.567 --> 01:06:28.988
What part of "Can you keep your dick out
of my office while I'm pregnant?"...

01:06:29.155 --> 01:06:30.740
did you not understand?

01:06:30.907 --> 01:06:34.744
- Edith, let's discuss this in the car.
- No, we'll be discussing this now.

01:06:34.911 --> 01:06:36.246
I am so sorry.

01:06:38.748 --> 01:06:42.961
I will be back at 3 and I expect there
to be no trace of you left here.

01:06:43.128 --> 01:06:45.213
All we did was kiss.

01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:47.132
Oh, my God, I'm... Your poor baby.

01:06:47.298 --> 01:06:49.342
I'm really, really...

01:06:56.182 --> 01:06:57.976
Audrey.

01:06:58.643 --> 01:07:00.353
Charles.

01:07:01.563 --> 01:07:03.565
Charles.

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:22.167
She was not supposed to be the one
to fuck this up. I was. It is my job.

01:07:22.334 --> 01:07:28.131
- I am always the one who does that.
- You'll get another job, Audrey.

01:07:28.298 --> 01:07:32.594
- I think you need to take some time off.
- I don't wanna take time off.

01:07:32.761 --> 01:07:35.096
I don't want to have all
day to sit around...

01:07:35.263 --> 01:07:38.975
and think about how half of me is
fucking dead for fucking ever.

01:07:39.934 --> 01:07:44.606
- Does that sound like fun to you?
- No, no, not really.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:48.651
It sounds terrible, I'm sorry. I...

01:07:52.781 --> 01:07:54.574
Basel.

01:08:02.665 --> 01:08:04.501
Basel.

01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.846
We need to get some ice cream.

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.392
Ice cream is not gonna fix this.

01:08:20.558 --> 01:08:24.312
Mrs. Brown, ice cream
fixes everything.

01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:28.399
Yeah, it's gonna get me a job?

01:08:28.942 --> 01:08:30.318
Yes.

01:08:32.904 --> 01:08:34.656
Here, would you hold this?

01:08:34.823 --> 01:08:36.908
You can even have some.

01:08:37.242 --> 01:08:39.077
This is gonna cheer you up.

01:08:42.330 --> 01:08:45.792
Well, Mrs. Brown, I got something
I've been wanting to give you.

01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:51.798
As you know, we are a happily married
couple with two lovely kids.

01:08:51.965 --> 01:08:54.009
But I want more.

01:08:54.884 --> 01:08:57.011
I wanna renew our vows, dear.

01:08:58.513 --> 01:09:00.180
Okay.

01:09:00.724 --> 01:09:03.018
You don't believe me, all right.

01:09:03.184 --> 01:09:08.564
So the thing I got you, Mrs. Brown,
is a very expensive ring.

01:09:09.691 --> 01:09:11.026
What are you doing?

01:09:11.192 --> 01:09:16.740
Will you marry me again and make me
the happiest man in the whole world?

01:09:18.366 --> 01:09:22.203
You are very cute but you
have terrible timing.

01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:24.706
Well, that's a weird no.

01:09:29.252 --> 01:09:31.046
For real...

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:32.881
I love you now.

01:09:35.341 --> 01:09:39.095
And I've loved you since the first
moment that I met you, Audrey.

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:50.939
- Take it back.
- I thought you'd have a different reaction.

01:09:51.107 --> 01:09:53.526
- Take that part back.
- Take what back?

01:09:53.693 --> 01:09:55.987
The part about loving
me since you met me.

01:09:56.154 --> 01:09:59.574
What difference does it make?
It's a nice thing to say.

01:09:59.741 --> 01:10:02.869
I need this to be
mine, to be my love.

01:10:03.036 --> 01:10:06.581
It is yours. I don't care if you
didn't love me when we first met.

01:10:06.748 --> 01:10:10.627
But if you loved me back then, it
means you don't actually love me.

01:10:10.794 --> 01:10:13.421
Well, I don't think
that's true, Audrey.

01:10:13.588 --> 01:10:15.715
I'm not Audrey.

01:10:17.217 --> 01:10:21.554
- Because you're Mrs. Brown?
- No, I'm not Mrs. Brown.

01:10:24.057 --> 01:10:25.767
And I'm not Audrey.

01:10:26.393 --> 01:10:29.104
I don't get what game
we're playing right now.

01:10:30.730 --> 01:10:32.482
I'm Laurel.

01:10:33.066 --> 01:10:35.235
I'm her twin.

01:10:38.071 --> 01:10:39.406
What does that mean?

01:10:41.282 --> 01:10:42.909
Audrey died, we're twins.

01:10:43.076 --> 01:10:46.287
- Audrey died.
- Are you...?

01:10:48.331 --> 01:10:51.084
- Are you being serious?
- Yes.

01:10:52.210 --> 01:10:56.881
So you died, or your sister died in
the car accident, and you came back?

01:10:57.048 --> 01:11:01.594
They got confused in the hospital.
They thought I was Audrey but I'm not.

01:11:01.761 --> 01:11:05.098
And I didn't remember at first.

01:11:05.932 --> 01:11:08.935
- If this is a joke, it's...
- It's not a joke.

01:11:10.395 --> 01:11:12.230
You lied this whole time?

01:11:12.397 --> 01:11:14.315
You pretended
to be your dead sister?

01:11:14.482 --> 01:11:17.068
I'm the same person. I just
have a different name.

01:11:17.235 --> 01:11:19.237
Who does that?

01:11:19.779 --> 01:11:21.990
I trusted you.

01:11:22.615 --> 01:11:25.577
- I asked if it was real and you said yeah.
- It is real.

01:11:25.744 --> 01:11:27.704
It's all bullshit.

01:11:27.871 --> 01:11:29.831
I'm so sorry. I just...

01:12:26.388 --> 01:12:28.014
Hi.

01:12:28.515 --> 01:12:31.434
- The wedding's not till next week, honey.
- I know.

01:12:31.601 --> 01:12:33.311
Can I come in?

01:12:33.478 --> 01:12:35.563
Come in, come in.

01:12:37.273 --> 01:12:42.404
I came here because I need
to tell you something.

01:12:43.863 --> 01:12:44.906
Okay.

01:12:46.408 --> 01:12:48.284
You guys...

01:12:49.703 --> 01:12:51.538
were wrong.

01:12:53.206 --> 01:12:56.126
At the hospital, you were wrong.

01:12:56.376 --> 01:12:58.670
Wrong about what?

01:12:59.963 --> 01:13:01.881
Who I am.

01:13:02.757 --> 01:13:06.928
Audrey is the one who died.

01:13:09.097 --> 01:13:10.473
What?

01:13:24.154 --> 01:13:25.488
Porcupine?

01:13:29.284 --> 01:13:31.077
Oh, my God.

01:13:36.249 --> 01:13:37.876
But, you...

01:13:38.043 --> 01:13:39.085
I mean...

01:13:40.003 --> 01:13:41.379
But...

01:13:42.172 --> 01:13:43.423
your hair...

01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:45.967
- I mean, we all thought...
- You poor child.

01:13:48.094 --> 01:13:50.055
When did you finally remember?

01:13:53.767 --> 01:13:56.102
The morning of the funeral.

01:13:57.729 --> 01:14:01.524
You went to your own funeral?
On purpose?

01:14:03.443 --> 01:14:04.903
Is this funny to you?

01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:07.238
No, no, it's not funny to me.

01:14:17.123 --> 01:14:19.709
No, Daddy.

01:14:34.099 --> 01:14:35.600
Dad.

01:14:41.398 --> 01:14:43.066
Dad.

01:14:45.318 --> 01:14:46.945
Daddy.

01:14:47.529 --> 01:14:48.905
Frank.

01:14:49.823 --> 01:14:51.908
Frank, do something.

01:14:52.075 --> 01:14:54.828
- Do something.
- I can't find my fucking cerulean.

01:14:54.994 --> 01:14:56.246
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:14:56.413 --> 01:14:57.580
No, stop it.

01:14:57.747 --> 01:14:59.082
There is no excuse.

01:14:59.249 --> 01:15:00.625
This is beyond...

01:15:00.792 --> 01:15:03.378
No, but, Dad, no one
cared that I was gone.

01:15:03.545 --> 01:15:05.338
How can you say that?

01:15:05.505 --> 01:15:06.840
You were my porcupine.

01:15:07.007 --> 01:15:08.925
- We did everything together.
- I know.

01:15:09.092 --> 01:15:12.846
But, Daddy, you didn't even have
anything to say at the funeral.

01:15:13.763 --> 01:15:15.098
I was in shock, you know?

01:15:15.265 --> 01:15:18.351
Just lost my baby girl.
Excuse me if I wasn't Shakespeare.

01:15:19.561 --> 01:15:21.062
I just...

01:15:21.896 --> 01:15:24.357
I just needed to know that...

01:15:26.067 --> 01:15:27.193
That you loved me.

01:15:27.819 --> 01:15:29.946
We're gonna have to
have another funeral.

01:15:30.113 --> 01:15:34.534
- What are people gonna say?
- I don't give a hot damn what they say!

01:15:34.701 --> 01:15:37.620
Don't get snippy with me!
I'm not the one who lied.

01:15:37.787 --> 01:15:39.581
Can I just have a minute?

01:15:39.748 --> 01:15:43.835
- Can you two just give me a moment?
- Well, I never!

01:16:41.685 --> 01:16:43.228
Daddy?

01:16:47.524 --> 01:16:49.025
Daddy.

01:17:05.583 --> 01:17:08.169
- I'll do that.
- I got it.

01:17:08.336 --> 01:17:09.796
But I always do the dishes.

01:17:09.963 --> 01:17:15.051
Well, I've been doing them since
you left, so it's about time.

01:17:15.635 --> 01:17:17.220
Okay.

01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:24.728
What can I do to make
you stop hating me?

01:17:30.442 --> 01:17:34.487
I don't know when I'm gonna find it in
my heart to forgive you on this, porc.

01:17:37.282 --> 01:17:38.908
I mean...

01:17:40.368 --> 01:17:42.954
I'm glad you're back and all...

01:17:44.622 --> 01:17:49.586
but here I am mourning the
death of another child.

01:17:50.295 --> 01:17:53.548
And I'll be goddamned if it's
not confusing as all hell.

01:17:55.175 --> 01:17:56.801
I understand.

01:17:56.968 --> 01:17:58.970
I don't think you do.

01:18:00.305 --> 01:18:02.057
But I want to.

01:18:02.223 --> 01:18:04.351
I want to know.

01:18:08.104 --> 01:18:11.649
If there's anything I took
away from your being dead...

01:18:11.816 --> 01:18:15.111
it's that I wished you'd have
stopped worrying about me...

01:18:15.278 --> 01:18:17.322
and gotten on with your life.

01:18:17.489 --> 01:18:20.658
You need to start worrying about
what you're dealing with.

01:19:25.515 --> 01:19:30.061
<i>Would anyone like to say a
few parting words to Audrey?</i>

01:19:38.028 --> 01:19:39.404
Well...

01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:46.411
this is a certifiably weird place
I've put everyone in, huh?

01:19:49.247 --> 01:19:52.042
Nothing I say really matters.

01:19:53.209 --> 01:19:56.046
You still think
there's something wrong with me...

01:19:57.213 --> 01:19:59.299
and you would be right.

01:20:00.717 --> 01:20:02.260
So...

01:20:04.387 --> 01:20:06.556
I'll just say this.

01:20:08.892 --> 01:20:10.602
Audrey....

01:20:12.395 --> 01:20:14.481
Audrey was...

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:20.528
everything to me.

01:20:22.572 --> 01:20:26.201
She was the much bigger
half of our whole.

01:20:29.621 --> 01:20:31.289
And I couldn't let her go.

01:20:55.063 --> 01:20:56.981
Hey, guys.

01:20:57.148 --> 01:20:59.067
- Hi, Laurel.
- Hey.

01:20:59.234 --> 01:21:00.527
Thank you for coming.

01:21:01.403 --> 01:21:05.615
Do you wanna give me
the official tour?

01:21:05.782 --> 01:21:07.701
A tour?

01:21:07.867 --> 01:21:09.452
Sure.

01:21:09.619 --> 01:21:12.539
This is the living
room with furniture.

01:21:13.623 --> 01:21:16.376
Okay, come with me.

01:21:19.879 --> 01:21:22.257
So are you staying here?

01:21:24.009 --> 01:21:25.719
No.

01:21:26.553 --> 01:21:30.098
It's not exactly an abode
for a grown woman.

01:21:30.265 --> 01:21:32.726
Well said, Captain Obvious.

01:21:32.892 --> 01:21:35.061
I was just saying.

01:21:36.730 --> 01:21:40.817
I thought I was going crazy back
there, but I knew it wasn't her.

01:21:40.984 --> 01:21:42.402
I know you did.

01:21:42.944 --> 01:21:45.155
You more than anyone.

01:21:47.365 --> 01:21:49.617
You must have really loved her.

01:21:49.784 --> 01:21:53.413
I wanted to be just like her.

01:21:54.539 --> 01:21:55.915
But I'm not.

01:21:56.082 --> 01:21:58.877
I guess we have more in
common than we thought.

01:22:06.384 --> 01:22:09.721
I'm gonna go back to the city...

01:22:10.805 --> 01:22:14.684
and I think it's best we remain friends
despite our past disagreements.

01:22:18.938 --> 01:22:21.066
Yeah, I agree.

01:22:22.776 --> 01:22:24.569
Good.

01:22:53.807 --> 01:22:55.767
Good technique.

01:22:56.559 --> 01:22:58.561
Beautiful palette.

01:22:58.895 --> 01:23:00.105
You got more of these?

01:23:03.483 --> 01:23:04.901
You should show them.

01:23:06.194 --> 01:23:09.406
Yeah, I was thinking about
taking them around.

01:23:14.244 --> 01:23:16.413
It's about time you
did your own work.

01:23:28.216 --> 01:23:29.926
So...

01:23:33.972 --> 01:23:37.809
you probably figured
this out already...

01:23:39.394 --> 01:23:41.104
but I'm in love.

01:23:44.399 --> 01:23:47.944
I know, I know we
disagree on this...

01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:55.160
but I actually think
he smells really good.

01:23:56.494 --> 01:23:58.580
He smells real.

01:23:59.247 --> 01:24:00.874
You know...

01:24:02.584 --> 01:24:04.210
like sweat and life...

01:24:06.796 --> 01:24:08.757
and sex.

01:24:11.384 --> 01:24:13.887
I feel like myself around him.

01:24:18.516 --> 01:24:21.144
And I'm making you a promise.

01:24:21.311 --> 01:24:23.104
Right now...

01:24:25.398 --> 01:24:28.985
I'm going to do what
you wanted me to do.

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:32.906
I'm going to be more like me.

01:24:34.532 --> 01:24:36.993
Find out what that really means.

01:26:51.002 --> 01:26:52.087
What do you want?

01:26:53.505 --> 01:26:55.090
You.

01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:57.008
I want you, please.

01:26:57.175 --> 01:26:58.551
May I please have you?

01:27:00.553 --> 01:27:02.222
Well, you know what?

01:27:02.389 --> 01:27:04.265
Fuck you if you think
I'm that easy.

01:27:04.891 --> 01:27:07.102
I know you're not that easy.

01:27:07.644 --> 01:27:10.355
- Little cowboy coming up.
- Hey, kids, what's up?

01:27:10.522 --> 01:27:12.816
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

01:27:12.982 --> 01:27:14.734
All right, get in there, guys.

01:27:14.901 --> 01:27:17.362
Guys, plenty of sweets right here.
It's candy.

01:27:17.529 --> 01:27:19.739
- You're early this year.
- Happy Halloween.

01:27:19.906 --> 01:27:22.826
- Happy Halloween.
- Happy Halloween.

01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:26.871
So, what are you dressed as?

01:27:27.038 --> 01:27:28.623
Myself.

01:27:30.375 --> 01:27:35.296
- So that's what Laurel looks like?
- Yeah, this is what I look like.

01:27:39.509 --> 01:27:44.305
I told everyone at home about
the whole identity thing.

01:27:44.472 --> 01:27:46.641
Wow, how'd that go?

01:27:46.808 --> 01:27:48.476
I'm still alive.

01:27:49.477 --> 01:27:52.772
Well, you seem to be, but you
never know with the two of you.

01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:58.028
I miss you.

01:27:58.194 --> 01:28:00.613
I miss you terribly.

01:28:02.449 --> 01:28:05.201
I know you feel like
you don't know me...

01:28:05.702 --> 01:28:08.246
but I'm telling you, you do.

01:28:09.330 --> 01:28:12.042
I'm just asking you to take
a chance on that person.

01:28:13.293 --> 01:28:17.714
I know I really messed up.
I know I am fucked up.

01:28:18.715 --> 01:28:20.675
But despite all that, I...

01:28:21.092 --> 01:28:23.386
All in all, I am...

01:28:24.554 --> 01:28:27.098
like, a pretty cool girl.

01:28:32.062 --> 01:28:34.314
Well, nice work on
complimenting yourself.

01:28:35.023 --> 01:28:36.608
Thank you.

01:28:38.026 --> 01:28:42.072
Also, I really think you should
know this cast comes off tomorrow.

01:28:42.572 --> 01:28:44.699
You've never seen
this forearm before.

01:28:44.866 --> 01:28:49.496
It's probably atrophied and will never
be as muscular as the other one.

01:28:49.662 --> 01:28:51.414
Gee, thank you.

01:28:59.005 --> 01:29:00.840
I don't know.

01:29:04.344 --> 01:29:06.930
Well, do you wanna
sit down with me?

01:29:13.978 --> 01:29:17.649
So what, did you, like, inherit
the duplex or something?

01:29:17.816 --> 01:29:19.401
Yeah.

01:29:19.984 --> 01:29:23.446
And I was thinking about
doing some construction.

01:29:25.031 --> 01:29:26.783
Like what?

01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:30.829
Tear down the wall between the
two apartments, make it one.

01:29:30.995 --> 01:29:32.789
Oh, yeah?
