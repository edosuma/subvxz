WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.840
This programme contains
some violent scenes from the start
and contains some strong language.

00:05.840 --> 00:10.440
I know where the gold is.
There's nothing you can do, not
if you want your gold back, Goliath.

00:10.440 --> 00:12.080
GUNSHOT

00:16.840 --> 00:19.320
What you found was one
of a consignment

00:19.320 --> 00:22.760
of eight 400 ounce gold bars
that were stolen in 1998.

00:22.760 --> 00:24.400
Who stole it?

00:24.400 --> 00:28.160
I spoke to our office in Boston and
they believe a criminal organisation

00:28.160 --> 00:30.760
called the Savage Family
are responsible.

00:33.760 --> 00:36.400
Is it true Robert Dardis
killed my husband?

00:36.400 --> 00:39.280
The last couple of times
I saw him with Colin

00:39.280 --> 00:41.360
he was in a silver car, a Mercedes.

00:41.360 --> 00:43.000
What's your login?

00:43.000 --> 00:47.520
Well, it's against the guidelines
to share login information
with another officer, sir.

00:54.440 --> 00:56.360
What's going on? Nothing.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.920
I like spending time with you.
I do, too.

00:59.920 --> 01:04.440
The boss is going to kill me. I mean
your da. Your da is going to kill
me. Want me to have a word?

01:08.080 --> 01:11.120
Why throw it from all the way
over there? You might miss.

01:12.320 --> 01:14.400
Unless you knew
where the camera was.

01:17.920 --> 01:20.520
Did you really find the gold?
One bar.

01:20.520 --> 01:22.440
We're in this together now.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.360
It was meant for the IRA.

01:28.520 --> 01:31.680
Goliath is dead.
What if he's still out there?

03:14.640 --> 03:17.200
Are you here for business
or pleasure?

03:17.200 --> 03:19.760
Oh, man, do I have to choose?

03:41.560 --> 03:43.480
Here's your paperwork.

03:43.480 --> 03:45.200
Sign here.

03:49.720 --> 03:53.000
Thank you. Have a nice day.

04:21.320 --> 04:25.840
How are you going to get
the gold out from under
your own people's noses?

04:27.160 --> 04:28.880
I need to figure it out.

04:28.880 --> 04:32.240
It won't matter as much if we
find more before anyone else does.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.080
When we find more.

04:35.360 --> 04:39.880
I'll, erm... I'll search the house
again. Colin must have left
something that could help.

04:44.520 --> 04:45.960
Of course.

04:47.320 --> 04:50.560
Well, thank you, Detective
Chief Inspector Brannick...

04:51.880 --> 04:53.520
..for everything.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.400
I need to get some money out.
You go ahead. I'll catch up.

05:28.920 --> 05:30.640
CAR HORN BEEPS

05:35.440 --> 05:36.880
Hi, Birdy.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.280
Not a secret any more, then.

05:46.280 --> 05:50.280
Aye. We should probably tell your
dad before he finds out on his own.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.120
You going to do it at work?

05:53.240 --> 05:54.840
You are scared.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.880
Tonight, then.
After you've finished.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.960
We'll go see him at home.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.760
That sounds fun.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.640
I better go.

06:05.640 --> 06:07.320
Bye. Bye.

07:05.280 --> 07:10.240
Forensics found gun oil deposits
on the gold bar

07:10.240 --> 07:14.760
that are consistent with the
oil sample from the M24 rifle.

07:14.760 --> 07:18.760
And there are moulds in the foam
material of the rifle cases

07:18.760 --> 07:21.560
that would correspond
with the bar size.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.320
So the gold travelled
with the rifles.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.720
Four bars and one rifle
to each case.

07:27.720 --> 07:31.520
I believe they were deposited
with Colin Foyle on this date.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.080
The same date as the first
Goliath disappearance.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.520
Aye.

07:38.480 --> 07:41.280
You really think Goliath was
a client of Colin Foyle's?

07:41.280 --> 07:43.360
Lauren Fitzpatrick confirmed it.

07:44.960 --> 07:46.800
He's dead, Niamh.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.120
Keenan is, aye.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.320
Well, why don't you
bring it up with him?

07:56.200 --> 07:59.960
Tom, you need to have a look at this
information request from the FBI.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.000
What's that?

08:04.920 --> 08:06.440
It's, erm...

08:07.600 --> 08:11.360
It's the connections between
the Goliath and Foyle cases, sir.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.480
I thought I made myself clear.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.920
The man's dead, Niamh.
End of story.

08:16.920 --> 08:20.000
This has connections
to the Foyle case, sir,

08:20.000 --> 08:25.200
and by not looking into that
we are making a choice
that I just don't understand.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.000
Well, then, let's you
and me have another talk.

08:41.920 --> 08:43.880
Birdy. How's it going?

08:43.880 --> 08:46.240
Grand. That was the DCI's
daughter, wasn't it?

08:46.240 --> 08:47.840
No. Aye, it was.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.800
Please, just don't tell anyone.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.160
I won't. Just between you
and the boss. I get it.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.920
Oh, my God.
We're going to tell him later.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.760
Oh, he is going to... I know.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.760
Shame. I enjoyed working with you!

09:03.160 --> 09:06.720
I told you what Lauren Fitzpatrick
said, sir, and...

09:08.760 --> 09:11.880
..there's circumstantial
evidence to suggest

09:11.880 --> 09:14.360
the possibility of an insider.

09:14.360 --> 09:18.240
What? Knowing the location
of the safe house, for one.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.200
Robert Dardis had a phone.

09:20.200 --> 09:23.520
Whoever threw the petrol bomb
just happened to avoid our cameras.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.920
Yeah, well, from what I hear there's
a bloody great fence in the way.

09:26.920 --> 09:30.440
The search for Dardis is
stone-cold, sir. Stop right there.
Just stop.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.920
Jackie's favourite subject.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.520
"Let's work as a team
and do it my way."

09:41.960 --> 09:43.600
Where were you?

09:43.600 --> 09:46.280
I just went out for a look
at the storage facility.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.120
Did you find anything?

09:48.120 --> 09:50.120
Tom! Get in here!

09:51.720 --> 09:53.960
Don't worry, Birdy. I'll be OK.

09:58.760 --> 10:02.720
Now listen to me, the pair of yous.
You're as bad as each other.

10:02.720 --> 10:07.560
You keep wanting to go after the
paramilitaries and you're on the
hunt for the fucking bogeyman.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.760
Those are two different
things entirely.

10:09.760 --> 10:13.080
Lauren Fitzpatrick could be lying
about the IRA. Well, she's not.

10:14.120 --> 10:18.000
I put feelers out to some
contacts that I still have
on that side of the fence.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.440
I met with them this morning

10:21.440 --> 10:24.160
and safe to say
they're nowhere near this.

10:24.160 --> 10:27.760
Don't you think you should have kept
us in the loop about that, sir?

10:27.760 --> 10:30.840
For the love of God, I am not
trying to work against you, Niamh.

10:30.840 --> 10:33.040
All I'm trying to do
is point out to you

10:33.040 --> 10:36.320
that the solution is jumping up
and down in front of your faces.

10:37.920 --> 10:42.520
There are two people presenting
themselves as prime suspects
in the murder of Colin Foyle.

10:42.520 --> 10:46.440
Robert Dardis and Olivia Foyle
have been filleted, glazed
and put on a plate.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.080
You're absolutely right, sir.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.800
We're just lacking
that one wee thing, erm...

10:53.760 --> 10:56.120
..evidence. Don't get sarky with me.

10:56.120 --> 11:00.400
There's not much we can do about
Dardis, if we can't find him.

11:02.080 --> 11:07.120
The more Olivia Foyle is out there,
the more chance she'll slip up,
if she's guilty. Oh, she's guilty.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.280
Don't you worry about that.

11:30.520 --> 11:31.960
No.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.000
TEXT ALERT

12:17.040 --> 12:18.520
Jesus!

12:19.680 --> 12:22.280
Who the hell, are you?
I didn't mean to frighten you.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.120
At least not yet.

12:27.160 --> 12:30.440
Oh, I was feeling
the effects of jet lag.

12:30.440 --> 12:33.040
I'm calling the police.
I wouldn't do that, Olivia.

12:34.440 --> 12:37.640
They always say it's worse when
you travel east, the jet lag.

12:37.640 --> 12:38.920
This...

12:39.880 --> 12:41.640
This is a great mattress.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.400
Just firm enough.

12:43.400 --> 12:46.200
Not the kind that sucks you in,
swallows you whole,

12:46.200 --> 12:48.640
like you're being buried
in concrete.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.120
Tell me who you are.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.280
Oh.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.000
Ryan Savage.

13:08.160 --> 13:10.240
Go on. Shake my hand.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.920
What are you doing here?

13:13.920 --> 13:15.960
I'm the guy who owns the gold.

13:19.440 --> 13:23.080
Let's go for a drive.
My car is at the bottom of the hill.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.440
If you want to stay alive.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.000
What are you taking
all that down for?

13:37.520 --> 13:39.720
Cos denial is easier.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.080
What?

13:42.320 --> 13:45.240
Why are we so afraid
to talk about Goliath, Birdy?

13:46.600 --> 13:49.160
Is it because we're afraid
he'll never go away?

13:50.160 --> 13:51.800
He's dead.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.040
Hmm.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.120
Isn't he?

14:01.920 --> 14:03.680
You seeing Izzy?

14:08.160 --> 14:09.880
Did Judith tell you?

14:09.880 --> 14:13.280
No, I heard it from Constable Scott
down in evidence. Constable...

14:14.880 --> 14:17.000
I'm guessing the boss doesn't know.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.240
Uh...

14:18.240 --> 14:20.560
Can I be there when you tell him?
No.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.000
No.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.760
A word of advice when it
comes to confronting him.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.840
OK, please, just no more jokes.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.280
Be more confident.

14:32.520 --> 14:35.760
He knows you're a highly
capable officer. He likes you.

14:35.760 --> 14:37.720
Have faith in yourself.

14:39.760 --> 14:42.320
Thanks. No, I'm kidding.
You're fucked!

14:49.440 --> 14:52.960
This one's not been used since the
heating on this floor was banjaxed.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.800
It's probably full of crap.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.520
Thanks, Judith.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.920
And keep it to yourself, please.

14:59.920 --> 15:02.120
Sarge. Not like you did with Birdy.

15:02.120 --> 15:03.520
Sarge.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.720
Great.

15:17.240 --> 15:18.920
Titanic Centre.

15:20.160 --> 15:22.840
I'm pleased to be ticking
this one off while I'm here.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.680
Hey, you know what they say
about the Titanic, don't you?

15:26.680 --> 15:28.520
It was fine when it left.

15:29.880 --> 15:33.880
I was going to say, built by
the Irish, sunk by the English,

15:33.880 --> 15:35.880
but I like yours better.

15:38.640 --> 15:41.040
Shall we go in? My shout.

15:51.240 --> 15:53.800
Do you really own all this gold?

15:54.800 --> 15:57.360
Dad does. I'm here to collect.

15:57.360 --> 16:00.160
Well, you don't seem
to be in much of a hurry.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.640
Well, because you're going
to tell me where it is.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.680
I don't know where it is.

16:06.480 --> 16:08.480
I find that hard to believe.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.440
Honestly, I don't.

16:17.120 --> 16:21.040
I looked at every time
Colin Foyle came and went
from the storage facility.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.720
This is the first time he moves
his belongings there,

16:23.720 --> 16:25.880
around the time
they bought the new house.

16:25.880 --> 16:28.400
A box like that could
easily hide a rifle case.

16:29.600 --> 16:32.920
Sir, he visits a handful
of times, always on his own.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.480
This is the 6th of February.

16:37.480 --> 16:40.040
Yeah, well that briefcase
looks heavy.

16:40.040 --> 16:43.000
The gold bar going
to Lauren Fitzpatrick? Yeah.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.160
The next time he visits
is on the 9th.

16:46.160 --> 16:49.320
This time he arrives with a suitcase
that looks easy to handle.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.400
And then he wheels it back out
nearly ten minutes later,

16:53.400 --> 16:55.920
only now it looks like
it weighs a ton. Oh, my God.

16:55.920 --> 16:58.360
He's never going to get that
in the car on his own.

16:59.840 --> 17:02.600
Do we have any footage of
the vehicle that he was using?

17:02.600 --> 17:05.440
Not from their cameras,
but I requested the footage

17:05.440 --> 17:07.880
for that evening
from a neighbouring warehouse.

17:08.920 --> 17:10.560
And I found this.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.840
Colin Foyle and Robert Dardis.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.560
Using a different car.

17:16.560 --> 17:19.120
I checked it.
It's from Dardis' employer's fleet.

17:19.120 --> 17:22.560
It's a silver Mercedes.
Must have taken it out for the job.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.360
Very good work, Birdy.

17:27.360 --> 17:29.920
Let's explore all
surveillance opportunities

17:29.920 --> 17:31.760
from that warehouse outwards.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.680
See if you can pick up the direction
the car was heading in.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.200
Sir, of course.

17:45.080 --> 17:48.120
My family sent eight bars of gold
to this country.

17:48.120 --> 17:50.880
The gold never reached
the people we sent it to

17:50.880 --> 17:53.800
and the man tasked
with receiving it disappeared.

17:53.800 --> 17:57.880
We always thought they cut and run,
put greed before the armed struggle

17:57.880 --> 18:02.360
and fled to one of them places where
the drinks are more expensive
than the rent boys.

18:02.360 --> 18:03.680
Huh.

18:03.680 --> 18:06.200
But, two years ago...

18:07.160 --> 18:10.440
..those two men were found in a hole
on an island near here,

18:10.440 --> 18:13.520
and, only recently, we get a call
to say that the gold has turned up

18:13.520 --> 18:15.920
in your husband's possession.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.240
Well, you have to believe me.
I don't know where it is.

18:20.840 --> 18:22.160
Uh-huh.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.920
But your husband did.

18:25.440 --> 18:28.400
Well, I wasn't privy
to my husband's secrets.

18:29.640 --> 18:31.400
Oh, that's funny.

18:32.520 --> 18:37.000
You strike me as the kind of woman
that would know every single
thing her husband was up to.

18:39.360 --> 18:42.760
So Dardis and Colin Foyle
are in this together.

18:42.760 --> 18:45.360
Goes against what Jackie
is thinking about the wife.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.200
Dardis could be working
for both of them.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.160
She's no grieving widow.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.080
She's raging.

18:58.120 --> 19:00.400
Because she's been
cut out of the gold.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.520
Does give her a motive.

19:02.520 --> 19:05.080
To kill in the name of revenge.

19:06.200 --> 19:09.320
Aye, but she'd argue
it gives her deniability

19:09.320 --> 19:13.920
because she couldn't possibly
have known what was going on
between Dardis and her husband.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.400
What is she playing at?

19:34.520 --> 19:36.480
Let's go back to the car.

19:36.480 --> 19:37.960
No.

19:39.920 --> 19:41.280
Really?

19:41.280 --> 19:43.800
I'm going to find your gold. How?

19:46.680 --> 19:49.560
I'm already looking
and I have help.

19:49.560 --> 19:51.000
Who?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.800
A detective.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.720
You hired a detective?

19:54.720 --> 19:56.640
Well, no, not as such.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.280
I don't follow.

19:59.520 --> 20:01.280
He's in the police.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.880
You're working with a dirty cop?

20:04.880 --> 20:07.720
No, he's investigating
my husband's murder.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.160
Uh-huh?

20:09.160 --> 20:11.120
And he found one bar of gold

20:11.120 --> 20:13.960
in a house belonging
to a client of Colin's.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.480
The jeweller.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.800
Yeah. Keep going.

20:18.800 --> 20:22.400
Well, the detective, he, erm...

20:23.720 --> 20:28.760
..he suggested he might like to
find more gold, but for himself...

20:30.560 --> 20:33.440
..and I told him I'd be able
to help him do that.

20:43.520 --> 20:46.520
So what's the deal
when you find the gold?

20:46.520 --> 20:47.960
Deal?

20:47.960 --> 20:50.080
Yeah. What split did you agree on?

20:51.600 --> 20:53.120
We'll see.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.880
Are you fucking him?

21:02.480 --> 21:06.080
I can give you and your poontangled
cop until the end of the week.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.280
Why do you even need it?

21:11.280 --> 21:12.600
Huh?

21:12.600 --> 21:14.680
I mean, if you're from this...

21:16.240 --> 21:18.520
..big American crime family,

21:18.520 --> 21:21.920
I mean, you've got to be
worth God knows how much.

21:21.920 --> 21:24.360
Why do you need these
eight bars of gold?

21:25.480 --> 21:28.800
A penny less than a million
is no longer a million, Mrs Foyle.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.320
I'm here to look after the pennies.

21:34.600 --> 21:38.000
"Almost all of the passengers
who ended up in the ocean

21:38.000 --> 21:41.360
"died of cardiac arrest
or other bodily reactions

21:41.360 --> 21:43.240
"to the freezing water...

21:44.360 --> 21:46.600
.."within 15 to 30 minutes."

21:49.040 --> 21:51.280
Imagine dying like that.

22:31.280 --> 22:34.120
Colin Foyle's former clients,
that is to say the clients

22:34.120 --> 22:36.560
he represented from the moment
he was qualified

22:36.560 --> 22:39.160
who were no longer with him
at the time of his murder,

22:39.160 --> 22:41.120
due to death or severed connections.

22:41.120 --> 22:44.800
The DCS is in there, obviously, and
I've separated out those individuals

22:44.800 --> 22:47.160
who may have been of interest
to us at any point.

22:47.160 --> 22:49.320
Great. Good work, Birdy.

22:49.320 --> 22:51.040
Sir.

22:51.040 --> 22:54.080
Jesus. There's such
a thing as trying too hard.

23:15.320 --> 23:16.920
What?

23:19.640 --> 23:21.040
Boss?

23:25.120 --> 23:27.280
Where is he? He's here.

23:28.760 --> 23:31.960
You led us to believe that the
only reason you were shutting down

23:31.960 --> 23:34.200
other lines of inquiry
into the Foyle murder

23:34.200 --> 23:36.520
was to keep some kind
of political status quo,

23:36.520 --> 23:38.720
while all the while
you had your own agenda.

23:38.720 --> 23:40.840
That's not... Explain this!

23:47.520 --> 23:49.160
My office.

23:50.200 --> 23:51.800
Niamh.

23:59.480 --> 24:02.040
What's going on? He'll tell you.

24:06.280 --> 24:10.480
We briefly ran Colin Foyle
as an intelligence source.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.720
What?

24:13.720 --> 24:15.640
Foyle was a CHIS.

24:15.640 --> 24:17.840
Why weren't we told?

24:18.880 --> 24:20.720
I was working in Belfast.

24:20.720 --> 24:24.080
We were investigating a fuel
smuggler called Hugo McNamara,

24:24.080 --> 24:27.440
who we suspected of moving
into human trafficking.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.720
It was around 2008, or thereabouts.

24:32.480 --> 24:36.880
We needed a local corrupt accountant
to push on to McNamara

24:36.880 --> 24:39.160
and I put Foyle's name forward.

24:40.320 --> 24:43.880
We came at him hard with
his connection to the
Irish Savings Bank raids,

24:43.880 --> 24:45.920
and he agreed to work for us,

24:45.920 --> 24:50.040
and the information that he passed
to us led to McNamara's arrest.

24:50.040 --> 24:53.360
And you were the arresting officer?
That's what it says.

24:54.520 --> 24:57.960
So you didn't sever ties
with Colin Foyle in 2006.

24:59.600 --> 25:02.880
As a client and an acquaintance,
yes, I did.

25:03.840 --> 25:06.080
But as an investigating officer, no.

25:06.080 --> 25:09.200
I was in touch with him
during the McNamara operation.

25:09.200 --> 25:12.840
And you don't think that has
implications for what
we're doing now, sir?

25:12.840 --> 25:16.720
Well, what's to tell you?
That he was a bent accountant?
We knew that already.

25:16.720 --> 25:19.400
Then why keep it from us?
You protect the source, Tom.

25:19.400 --> 25:24.480
Word gets out that Foyle was an
informant, you risk the lives of his
extended family. You know that.

25:24.480 --> 25:27.840
But we are your detectives, sir.

25:27.840 --> 25:29.160
Look...

25:30.120 --> 25:33.600
..when McNamara was arrested,
there was a lot of heat around Foyle

25:33.600 --> 25:35.640
so we eased back on using him.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.200
And as far as I can gather,

25:39.200 --> 25:42.480
contact with him dried up
over the next few years.

25:42.480 --> 25:45.560
I can't be specific.
I was promoted out.

25:46.920 --> 25:50.200
Well, what about McNamara?
What happened to him?

25:50.200 --> 25:53.240
He had a good lawyer.
He only did six years.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.560
Kept his hand in several
businesses around...

25:57.520 --> 25:59.040
..Castlewellan.

25:59.040 --> 26:01.320
I have no idea
where the man is now.

26:10.520 --> 26:12.280
Can you believe that?

26:13.360 --> 26:14.720
I, erm...

26:15.800 --> 26:17.960
I don't know what to think any
more.

26:17.960 --> 26:21.160
It's hard to take orders from
someone if there's no trust.

26:25.120 --> 26:28.200
The ANPR team found the silver
Mercedes on the night of the ninth

26:28.200 --> 26:30.760
on the road to the
Royal Down Yacht Club.

26:30.760 --> 26:32.960
Presumably it's Dardis and Foyle.

26:32.960 --> 26:36.240
If the gold can come in by boat,
it could go out by boat.

26:36.240 --> 26:38.040
Take Judith up there.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.800
I'll go see Olivia Foyle

26:39.800 --> 26:42.760
and find out if Colin ever spoke
to her about McNamara. Sir.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.520
Good work, Birdy.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.520
Sir. Uh-oh.

26:48.760 --> 26:50.360
Everything OK?

26:50.360 --> 26:53.920
Izzy is bringing a friend
home for dinner.

26:53.920 --> 26:56.840
Apparently I have to be
on my best behaviour.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
They should be so lucky.

27:06.760 --> 27:08.960
Those files you sent over.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.720
Have you heard of
the name Hugo McNamara? No.

27:11.720 --> 27:14.480
He was one of Colin's clients
about 15 years ago.

27:14.480 --> 27:17.000
He had some businesses
around Castlewellan.

27:19.640 --> 27:23.320
The first business is down there
somewhere. Just can't make it out.

27:24.600 --> 27:26.240
Wait a minute.

27:27.280 --> 27:29.080
It's a disused iron mine.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.560
A mine?

27:30.560 --> 27:32.400
No. Colin was claustrophobic.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.680
There's no way you'd find him
down a mine.

27:36.360 --> 27:38.720
Well, we're here now,
we may as well have a look.

27:41.320 --> 27:42.920
Are we OK?

27:44.000 --> 27:45.640
Yeah, course.

27:56.160 --> 27:59.000
If there's gold in there...

27:59.000 --> 28:00.680
..I'll find it.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.640
Sorry.

29:29.640 --> 29:32.440
I have to take this.
It's my son.

29:32.440 --> 29:33.480
Hello?

29:35.360 --> 29:37.920
Hold on, I'm just moving to get
reception.

29:37.920 --> 29:39.600
Can you hear me?

29:39.600 --> 29:41.160
Find it yet?

29:41.160 --> 29:42.800
I only saw you this morning.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.200
I like to stay on top of people.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.840
Yeah, well,
you told me I had the week.

29:46.840 --> 29:49.360
I did. And you did.
But, you know...

29:49.360 --> 29:51.040
My old man gets impatient.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.440
And, honestly, so do I.

29:54.400 --> 29:56.640
I'm close. I'm working on it.

29:56.640 --> 29:58.920
With your partner in crime?
Mm-hm.

29:58.920 --> 30:00.560
Uh-huh.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.680
I sure hope it works out, Olivia.

31:29.680 --> 31:30.920
Yeah.

31:31.840 --> 31:35.720
Good place to keep your
illegal paperwork.

31:35.720 --> 31:38.760
He wasn't that claustrophobic
after all.

31:38.760 --> 31:42.160
Is the gold here, Tom?

31:47.120 --> 31:49.800
It's just books. It's just books.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.240
Anyone remember Dardis or Foyle?

31:55.240 --> 31:58.280
No-one's been seen who matches their
description. No car, either.

31:58.280 --> 32:00.560
What about Olivia Foyle?
Did you ask about her?

32:00.560 --> 32:02.880
Not yet, but the club secretary is
waiting for us inside.

32:02.880 --> 32:05.800
SEAGULLS CRY

32:05.800 --> 32:07.400
Cheers, Tiny. Sarge.

32:11.080 --> 32:12.760
Give me a hand with this.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.160
Right, sir.

32:46.680 --> 32:49.000
Sir?

32:49.000 --> 32:51.200
Did you find anything out
about McNamara?

32:51.200 --> 32:54.200
She's keeping her cards very close
to her chest.

32:54.200 --> 32:55.720
Must be losing your touch. Ha.

32:55.720 --> 32:58.240
Or she's lying to you.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.520
She was at the yacht club two
days ago.

33:00.520 --> 33:01.960
Did she speak to anyone?

33:01.960 --> 33:03.040
The club secretary.

33:03.040 --> 33:05.080
Said she was looking for a boat
for her boyfriend.

33:05.080 --> 33:06.680
He said he couldn't help her.

33:08.480 --> 33:11.160
Her boyfriend?
She's talking about Dardis?

33:11.160 --> 33:12.800
My first thought, too.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.200
There was someone with her,

33:14.200 --> 33:17.480
but they managed to stay out of
camera view the whole time.

33:17.480 --> 33:19.080
And as for the boats,

33:19.080 --> 33:21.320
most of them are out of
the water this time of year,

33:21.320 --> 33:23.640
and of the two that set sail in
the last 48 hours,

33:23.640 --> 33:24.720
neither left the Lough.

33:24.720 --> 33:25.920
Romeo.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.800
Stop. Sorry.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.400
The officer on duty
at the Dardis house

33:30.400 --> 33:31.800
said her neighbour gave him this.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.960
It's footage from
the neighbour's doorbell camera,

33:33.960 --> 33:35.680
the night the petrol bomb
was thrown.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.200
Um...

34:47.560 --> 34:49.080
I didn't, I didn't, um,

34:49.080 --> 34:51.560
I just didn't want to do this
in a message. Um...

34:53.720 --> 34:56.320
Um... We can't... I can't meet your
dad tonight.

34:56.320 --> 34:58.560
We... Something's just come up
at work

34:58.560 --> 35:01.000
and it's just stressful, you know,

35:01.000 --> 35:04.240
and it's just not the right time.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.200
I...

35:07.200 --> 35:08.720
I'm sorry.

35:08.720 --> 35:10.240
I know you'll be upset, and I'll...

35:10.240 --> 35:13.040
I'll make it up to you.
And I...

35:13.040 --> 35:14.600
Look, I'll talk to you...

35:14.600 --> 35:16.680
I'll talk to you a bit later,
OK?

35:16.680 --> 35:18.000
All right, I love...

35:31.120 --> 35:32.560
Sir.

35:34.080 --> 35:36.840
I know we don't have enough
evidence yet,

35:36.840 --> 35:38.880
but I'm worried that leaving
Olivia Foyle on

35:38.880 --> 35:40.920
a long leash is a big mistake.

35:40.920 --> 35:42.480
It's all we can do.

35:42.480 --> 35:45.520
What if she runs?
Or does something else?

35:45.520 --> 35:46.680
I already....

35:48.760 --> 35:51.760
I fucked up with Dardis.

35:51.760 --> 35:54.400
Another mistake
and my job's on the line.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.680
Is there any way we can bring
her in?

35:59.080 --> 36:00.800
I understand what you're
going through.

36:00.800 --> 36:02.520
I do.

36:02.520 --> 36:05.280
But we have to hold firm
until we get what we need.

36:06.920 --> 36:08.040
Niamh...

36:09.360 --> 36:12.160
Your job's not on the line.

36:12.160 --> 36:13.440
I won't allow that.

36:15.120 --> 36:16.680
Thanks, sir.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.280
What are you doing in here?

36:52.520 --> 36:55.000
Judith owed me one.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.160
She let me in.

36:56.160 --> 36:57.520
Showed me what you were up to.

36:57.520 --> 36:59.680
No. You need to go.

36:59.680 --> 37:01.360
I'm not mucking about, Birdy.

37:08.680 --> 37:13.200

No.

39:33.200 --> 39:35.200
I do want to tell him, I just...
Birdy.

39:35.200 --> 39:39.240
No, I do, I just...
I just can't right now.

39:39.240 --> 39:41.120
Do I not get a say in this?

39:41.120 --> 39:43.600
It's to do with work.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.440
Show me. What?

39:45.440 --> 39:46.800
Well, show me the work that means

39:46.800 --> 39:48.560
that we can't tell my daddy
about us.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.240
No, I can't.

39:51.840 --> 39:52.920
Jesus Christ, Birdy.

39:52.920 --> 39:54.840
Do you not think that
I've seen this all before?

39:56.080 --> 39:58.240
What? The toll that this job takes
on you lot.

39:58.240 --> 40:00.600
The fact that... The fact that
you can't open up about

40:00.600 --> 40:02.040
a single thing that you do.

40:02.040 --> 40:03.840
No, it's... It's not that
I can't open...

40:03.840 --> 40:05.960
I thought that you and me
were going to be different.

40:05.960 --> 40:08.000
I thought that we were going to
share stuff and...

40:08.000 --> 40:09.360
And talk more truthfully, like.

40:09.360 --> 40:11.720
And we can, and I want to talk.
I just...

40:11.720 --> 40:13.360
I...

40:14.520 --> 40:16.040
My God.

40:19.360 --> 40:23.560
I was hoping that you were starting
to think about us like an "us".

40:23.560 --> 40:26.320
I am. If this is going too fast,
Birdy, you have to let me know.

40:26.320 --> 40:28.720
No, I don't... I don't...
Do you know what it is?

40:28.720 --> 40:30.280
Enough.

40:41.800 --> 40:44.920
HE PANTS

41:15.840 --> 41:17.880
You're not supposed to be driving.

41:17.880 --> 41:19.280
So arrest me.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.240
To what do I owe the pleasure?

41:23.880 --> 41:26.320
Do I need a reason to see you?

41:26.320 --> 41:27.800
You weren't so friendly earlier.

41:28.760 --> 41:32.520
Oh, poor Tom.
Are you always this needy?

41:32.520 --> 41:33.920
I need a shower.

41:42.240 --> 41:44.920

42:42.960 --> 42:44.840
Find everything all right?

42:44.840 --> 42:48.400
I'd say this view never gets old.
Huh.

42:48.400 --> 42:49.800
Hmm.

43:24.160 --> 43:26.800
An email has come through from
your step-children.

43:26.800 --> 43:29.000
Huh. Have they a new nickname
for me yet?

43:29.000 --> 43:32.040
It's a document that Colin added
to his will on the day he died.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.480
What is it?

43:35.480 --> 43:37.840
They couldn't make sense of it.
Neither can I.

43:37.840 --> 43:39.840
I don't get it. What?

43:39.840 --> 43:42.440
Well, this is the graveyard
where Colin is buried.

43:42.440 --> 43:43.960
Are you sure?

43:43.960 --> 43:45.560
Yeah, I had to look at it enough.

43:45.560 --> 43:47.200
But that's not his grave.

43:48.680 --> 43:51.040
Why would Colin give this
to his solicitor the day he died?

43:53.520 --> 43:54.720
The gold.

43:59.600 --> 44:00.960
We'll take my car.

44:00.960 --> 44:02.440
Yeah.

Unlock the door.

49:07.440 --> 49:09.400
Why did you follow me?

49:11.880 --> 49:13.840
I saw the video...

49:15.080 --> 49:17.360
..of you leaving the alleyway
behind the Dardis house.

49:18.480 --> 49:20.120
You threw the petrol bomb.

49:22.200 --> 49:24.440
Why didn't you show it
to anyone else?

49:24.440 --> 49:25.960
How...? How do you know I didn't?

49:27.600 --> 49:29.320
Because everyone would be here.

49:31.640 --> 49:33.000
There's other things.

49:35.120 --> 49:38.280
You using my login to check on
the silver Mercedes two days ago.

49:39.200 --> 49:41.320
Maybe the footprints by
the safe house.

49:42.840 --> 49:46.840
There's stuff that seemed...strange
or...

49:46.840 --> 49:48.880
..like there might have been
an insider.

49:51.760 --> 49:53.040
This makes sense of that.

49:53.960 --> 49:55.280
Uh-huh.

49:57.160 --> 49:58.800
And what is this?

50:00.680 --> 50:01.720
Go on, Birdy.

50:03.080 --> 50:04.840
What do you think you've seen here?

50:08.080 --> 50:10.440
Um, you're looking for the gold.

50:10.440 --> 50:11.800
You just found it.

50:12.960 --> 50:15.720
Why would I be looking for the gold?

50:17.200 --> 50:19.800
You think it's yours.
And why is that?

50:21.840 --> 50:25.560
Why do I think the gold is mine?

50:28.000 --> 50:29.200
I don't know.

50:30.800 --> 50:32.600
Yes, you do.

50:33.840 --> 50:35.200
I don't want to say.

50:37.360 --> 50:40.120
You need to tell me
what's on your mind.

50:40.120 --> 50:41.600
No.

50:41.600 --> 50:42.640
What?

50:44.640 --> 50:46.720
Keep your hands where
I can see them.

50:50.880 --> 50:52.320
Does this mean...

50:54.840 --> 50:56.920
..you killed Rob Dardis?

51:01.440 --> 51:02.760
Colin Foyle? No.

51:03.880 --> 51:05.400
That wasn't me.

51:11.800 --> 51:13.320
Are you going to kill me?

51:17.280 --> 51:22.200
Cos if you are, will you make sure
my body's been found?

51:22.200 --> 51:24.200
Don't hide my body, please.

51:24.200 --> 51:27.720
Seriously, sir. For my ma, like.
HE SOBS

51:37.400 --> 51:38.960
I wasn't expecting this.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.760
I wasn't expecting you.

51:49.240 --> 51:52.200
Fuck's sake, Birdy.
Why did you have to be here?

51:52.200 --> 51:54.360
What the fuck am I supposed
to do now?

51:54.360 --> 51:56.120
I don't know. I'm sorry, sir.

52:02.240 --> 52:05.440
Are you going to...?
Are you going to kill me?

52:05.440 --> 52:07.440
I don't want to kill you, Birdy.

52:11.200 --> 52:13.120
But what happens now?

52:13.120 --> 52:16.280
I-I... I can drive away.
I won't tell anyone.

52:16.280 --> 52:19.520
It would be like it never happened.
And why would you do that?

52:19.520 --> 52:20.720
Because....

52:22.640 --> 52:24.520
SHOUTS: Huh? Because...

52:24.520 --> 52:25.560
You see?

52:26.800 --> 52:29.160
You're as trapped as I am.

52:39.600 --> 52:41.160
It's tempting, though, you know?

52:43.360 --> 52:44.800
The fact that...

52:48.080 --> 52:49.920
..I could just stop.

52:52.600 --> 52:54.200
Now.

52:56.720 --> 52:58.760
End it here with you.

53:03.760 --> 53:05.120
But I've got Izzy.

53:08.120 --> 53:10.880
Aye.

53:08.120 --> 53:10.880
HE SNIFFS

53:10.880 --> 53:13.240
What...? What would happen to her?

53:17.440 --> 53:19.120
I don't know.

53:20.840 --> 53:23.680
She's strong, like. Aye.

53:26.200 --> 53:27.400
But she needs you.

53:28.640 --> 53:29.920
She needs her da.

53:34.920 --> 53:36.800
Did you need your da, Birdy?

53:40.200 --> 53:42.160
I wish, I wish I had him.

53:42.160 --> 53:44.680
I lost him when I was younger.

53:44.680 --> 53:46.560
He was killed,
he was killed on duty.

53:51.600 --> 53:52.720
I know, son.

54:07.160 --> 54:09.040

54:11.160 --> 54:13.440
One of us is going to have to make
the move eventually.

54:18.880 --> 54:20.720
There's something I should
tell you.

54:23.120 --> 54:24.320
What?

54:29.560 --> 54:32.240
What is it?

54:32.240 --> 54:33.400
I've been...

54:33.400 --> 54:34.840
Jesus, Birdy, spit it out!

ENGINE STARTS

54:40.760 --> 54:43.040

Tom Brannick, I am arresting you...
Birdy, turn that engine off now.

54:45.840 --> 54:47.960
..for the murder of Robert Dardis.
No, you are not.

54:47.960 --> 54:49.960
You do not have to say anything...
Birdy.

54:49.960 --> 54:51.640
..but I must caution you.
No. Don't, no.

54:51.640 --> 54:53.520
Detective Constable Bird,
I am ordering you.

54:53.520 --> 54:55.560
..rely on in court.
Birdy, please don't do this!

54:55.560 --> 54:57.160
It may harm your defence.
Anything...

54:57.160 --> 54:59.520
SHOUTS: Don't do this, son.
Don't fucking do this. Jesus!

54:59.520 --> 55:02.080
GUNSHOTS

55:07.680 --> 55:10.280
GUNSHOTS

55:13.200 --> 55:15.040
It's your gun, Tom.

55:15.040 --> 55:17.160
GUNSHOT

55:20.160 --> 55:22.480
And it's got your DNA all over it.

55:31.280 --> 55:33.440
SHOUTS: Birdy!
