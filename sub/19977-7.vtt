00:03.625 --> 00:05.959
We're not open yet.

00:10.545 --> 00:12.011
I said we're not open.

00:12.047 --> 00:13.313
Please! I need your help.

00:27.162 --> 00:28.728
Detective Jay Geils?

00:28.763 --> 00:30.330
Depends who's asking.

00:30.365 --> 00:31.664
Me.

00:31.700 --> 00:33.232
Come on in.

00:38.106 --> 00:39.129
Have a seat.

00:41.810 --> 00:43.710
So, what can I do for you, Miss...?

00:43.745 --> 00:46.179
Ashley. Mrs. Laura Ashley.

00:47.283 --> 00:49.415
Well, you see, the thing is, um,

00:49.999 --> 00:51.451
my husband's cheating on me.

00:51.486 --> 00:53.676
I think you want
the other kind of detective,

00:53.786 --> 00:56.687
the one with the drinking problem
and the colorful inner monologue.

00:56.722 --> 00:58.428
No, please. I'm begging you.

00:58.429 --> 01:00.340
I don't know what else to do!

01:00.830 --> 01:03.413
Please, please. I'm sure things
are just as bad as they seem.

01:08.601 --> 01:11.101
So, what do you need me to do?

01:11.137 --> 01:12.674
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

01:12.675 --> 01:15.575
You have no idea
how humiliating this is for me.

01:16.901 --> 01:17.897
Allow me.

01:26.087 --> 01:27.664
So, what's your husband's name?

01:27.665 --> 01:28.966
Steven Ashley.

01:28.967 --> 01:31.221
But be careful because
he's a very powerful man.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.190
He single-handedly prevented soccer

01:33.225 --> 01:35.212
from becoming popular
in the United States.

01:35.213 --> 01:36.753
And you want me to talk to him, or...

01:36.754 --> 01:38.471
Well, I'm planning on
filing for divorce,

01:38.533 --> 01:39.769
but with his influential connections,

01:39.770 --> 01:41.700
he'll be able to leave me with nothing.

01:41.701 --> 01:43.083
If I can prove he's having an affair,

01:43.084 --> 01:45.705
I can at least avoid
a prolonged custody battle.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.263
How many children do you have?

01:47.264 --> 01:48.739
Oh, I'm barren.

01:48.774 --> 01:51.675
Okay, Mrs. Ashley, this is not
something I really should be doing,

01:51.710 --> 01:53.644
but since you seem so
upset and attractive,

01:53.679 --> 01:55.245
I'm willing to make an exception.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.880
Thank you.

01:56.916 --> 01:59.550
Here's a picture of my
husband and his address.

02:02.156 --> 02:04.121
And how will I get in touch with you?

02:04.156 --> 02:06.208
I'll reappear when you least expect it.

02:06.971 --> 02:08.965
That's all one word, at Gmail.com.

02:34.421 --> 02:36.722
Geils, what's the good word?

02:36.757 --> 02:38.309
"Tremulous."

02:40.500 --> 02:43.528
Some lady asked me to take
pictures of her cheating husband.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.497
You mean this lady?

02:48.102 --> 02:50.469
Isn't she looking for the
other kind of detective?

02:50.504 --> 02:51.837
She just seems so desperate,

02:51.872 --> 02:53.672
and since I don't know
anything about her,

02:53.707 --> 02:56.675
I don't see how anything
bad could come of it.

02:58.141 --> 02:59.393
You're probably right.

02:59.511 --> 03:01.201
Any word on your dad being alive?

03:01.225 --> 03:02.447
Did you track down your step-mom?

03:02.483 --> 03:04.916
Turns out she lives in the area.
I'm gonna look her up.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.520
My gun is missing.

03:08.555 --> 03:10.722
Oh, do you want an extra?

03:10.758 --> 03:12.859
I just picked some up at Costco.

03:14.339 --> 03:15.160
Here.

03:18.707 --> 03:21.882
Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

03:27.618 --> 03:30.039
What are you bringing me in for?
I didn't do anything.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.695
I brought you in.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.079
Hello, Carnie.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.647
Well, well, well.

03:35.682 --> 03:37.849
If it isn't the step-daughter
I never wanted.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.685
Thanks for dragging me in
here on my smoke break.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.454
Now when am I gonna smoke?

03:42.489 --> 03:44.727
I know my dad's still alive, Carnie.

03:45.526 --> 03:47.659
It was the Christmas cards, wasn't it?

03:47.694 --> 03:50.228
Why would you lie to me
and tell me he was dead?

03:50.264 --> 03:51.730
I was only 12 years old.

03:51.765 --> 03:52.998
10.

03:53.615 --> 03:57.117
We figured it wouldn't bother you as
much if you thought you were older.

03:58.835 --> 04:02.403
Don't you get it?
He didn't want to be around you.

04:02.438 --> 04:04.105
Why would I believe anything you say?

04:04.140 --> 04:05.740
You treated me like garbage.

04:05.775 --> 04:07.408
Well, don't rewrite history.

04:07.443 --> 04:09.577
You loved riding around
in that trash can.

04:09.612 --> 04:11.579
Besides, how do you think I felt? Huh?

04:11.614 --> 04:13.714
I lost my husband
because my step-daughter

04:13.750 --> 04:15.649
was so rotten he couldn't stand her.

04:15.685 --> 04:17.885
You're lying. I know you're lying.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.754
Tell me where to find him.

04:19.789 --> 04:20.904
You think if I knew where he was

04:20.906 --> 04:23.773
I'd be working as a waitress
in that rat-infested diner?

04:23.898 --> 04:26.794
Nobody made you get your
master's in waitressing.

04:27.749 --> 04:29.964
I don't know where he is.

04:31.467 --> 04:33.834
So you gonna order something or what?

04:34.668 --> 04:36.637
I lost my appetite.

04:47.917 --> 04:49.750
Hey, mister, you want some lemonade?

04:52.255 --> 04:54.032
Sure, kid. I'll take a cup.

04:58.928 --> 05:00.261
It's five bucks.

05:26.255 --> 05:28.689
Oh, yeah, baby.

05:28.724 --> 05:30.958
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

05:39.235 --> 05:40.297
Smile, you're...

05:42.449 --> 05:43.029
dead?

05:47.009 --> 05:49.610
You're listening to KMON, The Moan.

05:49.645 --> 05:52.012
Playing love-making sounds
all day and all night.

05:52.048 --> 05:55.015
Up next, an old classic.

06:05.567 --> 06:07.013
Hey, this is my gun.

06:07.964 --> 06:09.181
Freeze! Don't you...

06:10.700 --> 06:11.832
Geils?

06:12.711 --> 06:14.168
What the hell are you doing here?

06:14.203 --> 06:17.369
I-I was supposed to take pictures
of this guy cheating on his wife,

06:17.370 --> 06:20.040
but then I found him
dead next to my gun.

06:20.076 --> 06:22.643
We just got a call about
a shooting at this address.

06:23.556 --> 06:25.679
Well, that's hilarious, 'cause
now it looks like I killed him.

06:26.582 --> 06:27.248
I know!

06:27.283 --> 06:29.283
This one's for the books.

06:32.154 --> 06:34.555
I can see us laughing
about this a long time.

06:34.590 --> 06:36.488
Like at my retirement party.

06:36.489 --> 06:38.124
"Remember the time
when it looked like Geils

06:38.160 --> 06:40.094
killed that guy and there
was evidence to back it up?"

06:42.508 --> 06:44.394
You're never gonna live
this one down, buddy.

06:45.473 --> 06:47.517
Anyway, you got the
right to remain silent.

06:47.518 --> 06:50.148
What am I talking about?
You know this stuff already, right?

06:54.431 --> 06:55.675
What the hell's going on?

06:55.676 --> 06:56.927
I try acupuncture once,

06:56.928 --> 06:58.904
and one of my cops kills someone?

06:58.905 --> 07:02.168
Councilman Steven Ashley was
found dead from a gunshot wound.

07:02.169 --> 07:05.326
And we found Geils standing over
him with a gunshot dispenser.

07:05.327 --> 07:07.114
Oh, great, now Internal Affairs

07:07.115 --> 07:09.880
is gonna get involved,
which means Abigail Liukin.

07:10.513 --> 07:14.182
Looks like another one of your
flock's gone astray, Atkins.

07:14.217 --> 07:16.150
I thought Tribeca was the dirty cop.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.631
Turns out it's her boyfriend.

07:17.632 --> 07:18.946
We're seeing other people.

07:18.947 --> 07:21.969
Mm. Drove him away with your bad haircut
and your masculine manner.

07:21.970 --> 07:23.579
Yeah, what's it to you?

07:23.580 --> 07:25.935
What the hell was Geils
doing over there anyway?

07:26.161 --> 07:27.373
Geils hates murder.

07:27.467 --> 07:30.498
Some lady wanted him to take
pictures of her cheating husband.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.947
That's his story?

07:31.948 --> 07:34.553
That he was trying to catch the
councilman cheating on his wife?

07:34.818 --> 07:35.825
Well, news flash.

07:35.826 --> 07:37.872
Councilman Ashley was a bachelor.

07:37.907 --> 07:39.546
So who the hell was this woman?

07:39.547 --> 07:42.611
Somebody who had it out for Ashley
and used Geils to cover her tracks.

07:43.066 --> 07:45.260
You can bat around
all the theories you want,

07:45.262 --> 07:47.642
but we've got opportunity,
a murder weapon,

07:47.675 --> 07:49.163
and a kid selling lemonade

07:49.164 --> 07:50.996
who heard gunshots
coming from that house.

07:51.883 --> 07:53.424
It's over for Geils.

07:56.426 --> 08:00.361
So, Nathan, you saw Detective
Geils go into the house

08:00.397 --> 08:02.461
and then you heard three loud bangs?

08:02.812 --> 08:04.719
Uh, yes, sir. It was really scary.

08:05.443 --> 08:06.386
Was it?

08:07.088 --> 08:09.847
So why do I have affidavits
from three of your friends

08:09.848 --> 08:12.232
saying you were doing
cartwheels in a cul-de-sac

08:12.278 --> 08:13.741
30 minutes later?

08:14.518 --> 08:16.377
Uh... uh...

08:16.737 --> 08:17.812
"Uh, uh, uh."

08:17.847 --> 08:20.214
You didn't hear any gunshots, did you?

08:20.250 --> 08:21.316
You're a liar.

08:21.351 --> 08:22.984
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

08:23.019 --> 08:24.252
Hey, hey, hey. Relax.

08:24.287 --> 08:25.186
Times infinity!

08:25.221 --> 08:26.254
Hey, hey, hey, cool out!

08:26.323 --> 08:27.396
He started it.

08:27.397 --> 08:28.390
Chill.

08:28.391 --> 08:30.043
Let me talk to him.

08:30.931 --> 08:32.546
I used to be a kid.

08:37.232 --> 08:38.399
Hey, buddy.

08:38.434 --> 08:40.134
Everything's gonna be all right.

08:40.169 --> 08:42.102
Uncle Detective Tanner's here.

08:42.138 --> 08:44.230
We just need your help
to try to figure out

08:44.231 --> 08:46.518
which bad guy made the bang-bang.

08:49.212 --> 08:50.545
Are you sure it was this guy?

08:50.580 --> 08:51.512
Yeah, that was him.

08:51.548 --> 08:54.407
He bought some lemonade and then he
went in and killed the councilman.

08:55.714 --> 08:58.348
Oh. Isn't he smart?

08:58.418 --> 09:01.022
How did you know he was a councilman?

09:01.940 --> 09:04.270
Because I follow local politics.

09:05.202 --> 09:06.361
Really?

09:07.729 --> 09:09.639
How do you feel about Prop 31?

09:10.433 --> 09:11.970
Um, for it?

09:13.802 --> 09:16.504
So you want to permanently
close El Monte Reservoir,

09:17.171 --> 09:21.242
even though it provides clean water
for the whole San Gabriel Valley?

09:23.631 --> 09:25.537
Nathan, dinner!

09:25.617 --> 09:27.556
My mom's calling me. I got to go.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.684
The El Monte Reservoir proposition

09:32.685 --> 09:35.882
was on last year's ballot,
but you already knew that.

09:37.927 --> 09:39.260
Nathan's lying.

09:39.295 --> 09:42.329
Tanner, Tribeca, get the hell in here!

09:43.233 --> 09:44.857
Say hello to Mr. X,

09:44.858 --> 09:47.969
another member of L.A. City Council.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.041
Nice to meet you, detectives.

09:50.042 --> 09:53.007
I believe I know why Councilman
Ashley was murdered.

09:53.042 --> 09:55.309
He was about to be the deciding vote

09:55.345 --> 09:58.346
on a ban against oil
drilling within city limits.

09:58.381 --> 10:00.297
They're drilling for oil
inside the city?

10:00.298 --> 10:01.609
Oh!

10:01.610 --> 10:04.450
And there are many dark
forces that would do anything

10:04.858 --> 10:07.658
to prevent that ban from
passing, including murder.

10:08.805 --> 10:10.522
Let me show you what I mean.

10:15.012 --> 10:17.396
By the way, I'm Gary. Gary Ecks.

10:17.545 --> 10:19.426
_

10:28.536 --> 10:31.470
Millions of gallons of crude oil
right in our backyards.

10:31.506 --> 10:33.672
Can't get more convenient than that.

10:33.708 --> 10:36.275
I'm telling you guys,
this is really bad.

10:36.310 --> 10:40.513
Councilman Ashley tried to
stop it and it got him killed.

10:41.778 --> 10:44.334
Would you detectives like
a Popsicle on a nice hot day?

10:44.335 --> 10:45.493
Don't mind if I do.

10:45.923 --> 10:48.254
The fossil fuel industry,
as you can imagine,

10:48.289 --> 10:49.688
was totally against the ban.

10:50.257 --> 10:52.725
But no one spoke out against it louder

10:52.760 --> 10:56.320
than the CEO of Westernish Energy,

10:56.384 --> 10:57.888
Mortimer Begoyle.

10:58.874 --> 11:01.306
You got a lot of nerve showing up here.

11:01.669 --> 11:03.369
Crude oil built this country,

11:03.404 --> 11:05.771
and I know it's fashionable
to hate it now,

11:05.772 --> 11:08.274
but there was a time
when the men who sucked

11:08.309 --> 11:11.830
that black gold out of the
earth were treated like gods.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.513
It was a better time.

11:18.019 --> 11:20.184
Now, look, I run a legitimate business.

11:20.708 --> 11:24.035
Sure, I've done things that I'm not
proud of, like warming the earth,

11:24.067 --> 11:26.336
but you can't make an omelette
without breaking eggs.

11:26.384 --> 11:28.160
And none of it, okay... none of it...

11:28.196 --> 11:29.762
makes me a murderer.

11:30.451 --> 11:32.231
Okay, yes, yes.

11:32.266 --> 11:34.767
We put up some resistance to the ban.

11:34.802 --> 11:38.204
A couple of attack ads,
story line on "Empire,"

11:38.239 --> 11:41.006
but I swear to God I had nothing to do

11:41.042 --> 11:43.075
with killing Steven Ashley.

11:43.110 --> 11:46.579
You think I don't know what I have?!

11:46.614 --> 11:49.181
I cry myself to sleep every night

11:49.217 --> 11:51.450
thinking about what I do to this planet!

11:51.486 --> 11:55.120
I'm... I'm feeling like a monster!

11:55.156 --> 11:56.522
And I want out.

11:56.557 --> 12:02.194
Please, God, put me out of my misery!

12:03.903 --> 12:06.499
Please tell me you found
something that exonerates Geils.

12:06.534 --> 12:08.501
The bullet was definitely from his gun.

12:08.536 --> 12:10.603
His fingerprints
are on the gun, his hair,

12:10.638 --> 12:13.239
fibers from his clothes,
his footprints, his saliva,

12:13.274 --> 12:15.905
two eyelashes, and a drop of semen
were all found at the scene.

12:15.906 --> 12:18.635
Okay, look, I know you
have a grudge against me,

12:18.729 --> 12:21.413
but Geils has been nothing
but honest and loving with you,

12:21.449 --> 12:23.616
and for you to take
some perverse pleasure

12:23.651 --> 12:24.548
in seeing him in trouble

12:24.549 --> 12:27.219
makes you a truly
horrible, rotten person.

12:27.423 --> 12:28.964
But there were other
fingerprints on the gun,

12:28.965 --> 12:31.412
as well as other
footprints at the scene.

12:38.165 --> 12:38.904
Geils!

12:38.905 --> 12:40.299
We only have a few minutes.

12:40.334 --> 12:41.734
We were picking up trash on the 101

12:41.769 --> 12:43.302
and the guard took a phone call.

12:43.337 --> 12:48.207
Oh, this is Tony, Jorge,
and Wade McDink.

12:48.824 --> 12:50.843
The guy who barbecued his whole family?

12:50.878 --> 12:53.279
No. I boiled them.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.805
I am never gonna live that movie down.

12:56.661 --> 12:58.584
I wanted to tell you guys
I remember something

12:58.619 --> 13:00.419
about the woman who set me up.

13:00.454 --> 13:02.427
She had a tattoo of one of those

13:02.428 --> 13:05.324
dipping bird toys on her left breast.

13:06.227 --> 13:08.723
I know it's not much,
but if we can figure out

13:08.725 --> 13:10.359
what artist made that tattoo,

13:10.406 --> 13:11.830
we can figure out who the hell she is

13:11.866 --> 13:14.633
and why she wants me to fry
for the councilman's death.

13:14.669 --> 13:15.617
What?

13:15.618 --> 13:17.403
Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you guys,

13:17.438 --> 13:18.771
I got the death penalty.

13:18.806 --> 13:20.306
- What?! No!
- Yeah.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.553
I love you.

13:24.345 --> 13:27.580
I, uh, also got the death penalty.

13:27.615 --> 13:29.348
No.

13:30.358 --> 13:32.189
I don't know how much news
you were getting in prison,

13:32.213 --> 13:33.786
but apparently the councilman was...

13:33.821 --> 13:36.555
Yeah, he was trying to pass
a ban on backyard drilling.

13:36.591 --> 13:38.457
I got a job at the prison newspaper

13:38.492 --> 13:40.277
and I'm trying to make
facts matter again.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.113
Also, Scholls was just telling me

13:42.114 --> 13:44.430
that there was another set
of footprints at the scene.

13:44.465 --> 13:46.493
I'm assuming you had a
monkey walk in various shoes

13:46.494 --> 13:47.733
across a sample floor?

13:47.768 --> 13:49.468
We're doing tests right now.

13:50.404 --> 13:51.670
We believe our suspect

13:51.706 --> 13:53.639
was wearing Christian Louboutin heels.

13:53.674 --> 13:56.117
She was a size 9, about 120 pounds,

13:56.118 --> 13:57.886
ate bananas, and wore a diaper.

13:58.151 --> 14:01.447
I'm gonna find that woman,
Geils, so help me God.

14:01.482 --> 14:03.849
You're not gonna fry, not on my watch.

14:03.884 --> 14:05.570
I really appreciate that.

14:08.273 --> 14:10.612
Wade, we better get back to the... Wade!

14:15.522 --> 14:18.305
Such a good boy.

14:19.477 --> 14:21.550
The other horses told me you'd be here.

14:22.251 --> 14:24.379
You know why I like horses, Tribeca?

14:24.415 --> 14:27.449
They're silent and they
can see through walls.

14:27.485 --> 14:30.028
Geils is a good cop
and he needs your help.

14:30.029 --> 14:33.155
He should've thought about that
before he shot Steven Ashley.

14:35.240 --> 14:36.381
He didn't do it.

14:36.527 --> 14:38.364
And I think, on some
level, you know that,

14:38.497 --> 14:39.595
so don't push this thing

14:39.630 --> 14:41.663
just because you know it's hurting me.

14:43.968 --> 14:45.801
That is a big part of it.

14:45.836 --> 14:47.469
Help me clear his name.

14:55.679 --> 14:58.480
All right, Tribeca.
I'll do some digging.

14:58.516 --> 15:01.497
But if Geils' number comes up,
there's nothing I can do.

15:18.078 --> 15:19.240
Hello, Nathan.

15:19.561 --> 15:22.204
H-Hey, come on.
They... They can't do that.

15:22.239 --> 15:23.672
Yep.

15:23.707 --> 15:25.874
Selling lemonade without a license, huh?

15:25.910 --> 15:27.676
You're going away for a long time.

15:27.711 --> 15:29.216
I-I know my rights! I know my rights!

15:29.218 --> 15:31.258
Let's have a look at
your finances, shall we?

15:31.281 --> 15:33.572
Whoa. $11 million?

15:33.859 --> 15:35.525
Sure sold a lot of lemonade that day.

15:36.987 --> 15:37.875
It was hot!

15:38.522 --> 15:40.266
And it's about to get hotter.

15:41.191 --> 15:42.024
What?

15:42.059 --> 15:42.958
Oof!

15:44.489 --> 15:46.699
We looked at the footage on Kyle's phone

15:46.700 --> 15:49.131
and it clearly shows Geils
buys the lemonade,

15:49.166 --> 15:53.264
goes into the house, then... nothing.

15:54.596 --> 15:55.704
Silence.

15:55.739 --> 15:58.313
The exact time that kid
claims to hear the gunshots.

15:58.314 --> 16:01.076
We're thinking somebody paid him
to say he heard the gunshots.

16:01.111 --> 16:02.878
Who? The woman with the tattoo?

16:02.913 --> 16:04.181
I called every place in town.

16:04.182 --> 16:06.420
Found three bird dipper tattoos,

16:06.421 --> 16:09.441
all of them middle school
teachers, all had alibis.

16:11.624 --> 16:12.930
It's not a bird dipper.

16:22.299 --> 16:23.647
It's an oil derrick.

16:26.547 --> 16:27.727
Atkins.

16:28.872 --> 16:30.153
You're kidding me.

16:31.153 --> 16:32.271
All right, thanks.

16:34.795 --> 16:37.229
They moved up Geils' execution to today.

16:41.068 --> 16:43.119
If you're not gonna touch that steak,

16:43.120 --> 16:45.228
can I at least have a bite of your hair?

16:45.642 --> 16:49.074
I'm not gonna eat my last meal
'cause I'm not gonna die.

16:49.765 --> 16:51.710
Tribeca's gonna figure out
who that woman is

16:51.760 --> 16:53.863
and she's gonna match
the prints on the gun,

16:53.864 --> 16:55.997
and this whole thing's gonna go away.

16:56.075 --> 17:00.652
Well, I admire your spirit,
Geils, but the system is broken.

17:00.688 --> 17:04.656
My last roommate got executed
for unpaid parking tickets

17:04.692 --> 17:05.817
and killing a guy.

17:05.818 --> 17:07.693
Sorry, Wade, but I believe in the system

17:07.728 --> 17:09.575
and I believe the system's
gonna get me out of here

17:09.576 --> 17:13.498
way before they shoot 50,000 volts
of electricity into my brain.

17:15.272 --> 17:16.164
That one.

17:17.994 --> 17:19.935
Okay, cool. Got it. Thanks. Peace.

17:20.590 --> 17:23.530
Guess who got an oil derrick
tattoo six months ago?

17:23.835 --> 17:24.794
Cher.

17:24.954 --> 17:27.855
Yeah. And Stephanie Begoyle.

17:28.038 --> 17:29.993
Mortimer Begoyle's only daughter.

17:30.463 --> 17:33.067
And the heiress to the
Westernish Energy fortune.

17:33.558 --> 17:34.891
Take her down,

17:35.191 --> 17:38.407
and for God's sake,
don't hurt her money!

17:43.081 --> 17:45.052
Where's your daughter, Stephanie?

17:50.863 --> 17:52.054
Drop your weapons.

17:56.607 --> 17:58.340
You don't have to do this, Stephanie.

17:58.742 --> 18:00.409
You could still live a good life.

18:00.781 --> 18:02.381
I've committed double murder.

18:02.416 --> 18:04.013
I didn't say a great life, just...

18:04.014 --> 18:05.587
You just don't get it, do you?

18:05.899 --> 18:07.386
Oil is special.

18:07.421 --> 18:08.839
It's nature's candy,

18:08.840 --> 18:10.999
and the only way to get it
is to drill into the ground.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.748
If that causes headaches
and nausea and asthma,

18:14.749 --> 18:16.196
that's a small price to pay.

18:16.482 --> 18:18.748
And killing your father?
Is that a small price?

18:19.066 --> 18:20.699
Now you're getting it.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.988
He was gonna walk away from billions

18:22.989 --> 18:26.802
to pursue his dream of handing
out pretzel samples at the mall.

18:27.408 --> 18:30.208
My father faked his own
death when I was 12,

18:30.244 --> 18:33.163
and I would give up everything
to hear his voice again.

18:33.781 --> 18:35.380
Why are you telling me that?

18:36.070 --> 18:37.930
I don't even know who you are.

18:39.299 --> 18:40.152
Well, oh, well.

18:41.575 --> 18:42.874
Doesn't matter.

18:43.090 --> 18:44.456
Don't.

18:46.693 --> 18:47.859
She's not downstairs.

18:47.895 --> 18:49.861
You guys having any luck up here?

18:51.077 --> 18:52.729
Why'd y'all drop y'all guns?

18:53.066 --> 18:54.456
Why is that guy dead?

18:54.802 --> 18:56.006
What's up with her?

18:57.142 --> 18:58.336
Geils.

19:08.943 --> 19:10.606
All right. Good practice.

19:10.607 --> 19:13.479
It's gonna go just like that,
but for real this time, okay?

19:13.651 --> 19:14.717
Here we go.

19:16.190 --> 19:18.157
- Stop the execution!
- Okay, sorry.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.753
Let's go, partner.
We've cleared your name.

19:23.359 --> 19:25.399
I never doubted you for a minute.

19:28.381 --> 19:30.884
Get a room, you two.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.104
Tribeca cleared my name.

19:33.140 --> 19:34.172
Ah! Isn't that nice!

19:34.208 --> 19:35.440
Angie, you remember Wade.

19:35.476 --> 19:36.842
Yeah. Yeah, we met before.

19:36.877 --> 19:38.143
Of course. Good to see you again!

19:38.178 --> 19:39.478
- Good to see you, too.
- Always...

19:39.513 --> 19:41.996
I'm so sorry. We need to kill him now.

19:42.083 --> 19:43.715
- Oh, okay.
- Great to see you.

19:43.751 --> 19:45.384
- Thanks. Take care.
- Bye now.

19:45.419 --> 19:46.585
- Later, buddy.
- Bye.

19:47.215 --> 19:47.924
Order!

19:48.216 --> 19:50.016
Order.

19:50.096 --> 19:53.564
With Councilman The Mom from
the Oil Drilling Scene's vote,

19:53.600 --> 19:56.701
the ban on drilling for
oil within city limits

19:56.736 --> 19:57.633
is hereby passed.

20:01.741 --> 20:03.444
Council is adjourned.

20:09.916 --> 20:11.482
Liukin.

20:11.517 --> 20:13.851
Thank you. I owe you one.

20:14.907 --> 20:16.057
You owe me two.

20:17.408 --> 20:20.124
That's everything I could
dig up on your father.

20:20.871 --> 20:21.987
How'd you know about this?

20:22.027 --> 20:24.228
We've been tailing you since
you were arrested last year.

20:24.272 --> 20:26.058
Bugged your house, tapped your phones,

20:26.059 --> 20:28.023
spied on you with your webcam.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.802
You have a really great body.

20:32.910 --> 20:33.837
Thank you.
