WEBVTT

00:23.732 --> 00:24.733
- Welcome.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.944
Welcome to the land of the free,

00:27.027 --> 00:28.612
home of the brave.

00:29.571 --> 00:32.448
A country of the
people, by the people,

00:32.533 --> 00:34.076
For the people.

00:34.201 --> 00:37.955
Where if you work hard,
your dreams can come true.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.750
A safe haven for families
from all walks of life.

00:41.834 --> 00:44.711
On behalf of everyone
from this great land,

00:44.795 --> 00:49.800
we welcome you, embrace you,
because we need you.

00:49.925 --> 00:51.593
- In Spanish, braceros means

00:51.677 --> 00:54.221
a man who works
with arms and hands.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.099
- We need leaders.

00:57.182 --> 00:59.101
- And the Oscar goes to...

00:59.184 --> 01:00.686
- We need icons.

01:00.936 --> 01:02.229
- I'd like to thank...

01:02.312 --> 01:03.522
<i>- Mi gente latino.</i>

01:03.689 --> 01:05.147
- We need entertainment.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.650
- Hi, baby bear, I'm dora.

01:06.733 --> 01:07.609
- And i'm-

01:07.693 --> 01:09.152
- Miguel.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.029
- Quite a run.

01:11.113 --> 01:12.113
- Immigrants.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.782
- We get the job done.

01:14.324 --> 01:15.993
- We need fresh ideas.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.494
- Barbie in Mexico is stunning

01:17.578 --> 01:19.997
in her ceremonial dress, and
her chihuahua is adorable.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.461
- But most of all...

01:27.629 --> 01:28.755
We need villains.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.592
- So you can point
your fucking fingers,

01:32.134 --> 01:33.886
and say, "that's the bad guy."

01:33.969 --> 01:36.013
- So we can scare people.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.806
They're immigrants.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.766
- They're invaders.
- Let me finish!

01:39.850 --> 01:40.726
Let me finish.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.144
Let me finish!

01:43.562 --> 01:45.689
- These aren't people.
These are animals.

01:45.856 --> 01:47.107
- Why do you hate us?

01:47.649 --> 01:49.067
Because we're Mexicans?

01:50.777 --> 01:51.904
- As the illegal invasion

01:51.987 --> 01:53.989
at our southern
border intensifies...

01:54.156 --> 01:56.867
- We're gonna do whatever is
necessary to build a wall.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.995
- And a one-way ticket back
to where you came from.

02:00.204 --> 02:01.288
- It is an invasion.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.664
- I'm fucking American!

02:02.748 --> 02:04.750
Don't fucking touch
my burrito, bitch!

02:05.167 --> 02:06.919
- So there's an enemy to fight.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.713
- If you don't speak English
and don't contribute, get out.

02:09.795 --> 02:11.548
- The best way to describe them

02:11.632 --> 02:13.342
is to be more like
a summer camp.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.843
- To make money.

02:14.927 --> 02:18.180
- It does seem like the
america that we know and love

02:18.430 --> 02:19.890
doesn't exist anymore.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.558
- To stay in power.

02:21.642 --> 02:25.854
And most importantly,
to feel like heroes.

02:25.938 --> 02:27.731
- It does not mean,
because we created them,

02:27.814 --> 02:29.149
that we somehow forgive them

02:29.233 --> 02:31.026
or do not take
them out of society

02:31.151 --> 02:33.278
to protect my family
and yours from them.

02:33.403 --> 02:34.404
- Do not come.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.533
Do not come.

02:37.783 --> 02:42.287
- This American carnage
stops right here

02:42.538 --> 02:45.415
and stops right now.

02:46.166 --> 02:51.380
- God bless you and god bless
the United States of America.

- I need a favor.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.240
- You can't just grab a man
by the headphones anymore.

04:07.289 --> 04:08.707
- Could you cover
the drive-through?

04:08.790 --> 04:10.190
Rosita just canceled
and I just need

04:10.250 --> 04:11.561
to bring the kids
to their yaya's.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.587
- But ninja, i'm
about to clock out.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.380
- Please, please, please.

04:15.506 --> 04:17.382
- Stop it.
- Please.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.261
All right.

04:21.345 --> 04:23.055
Fine. I'll cover
your shift, okay.

04:25.557 --> 04:26.850
Don't worry about it. Have fun.

04:26.934 --> 04:27.976
- Thank you.

04:28.185 --> 04:30.562
- Ha ha, you got stuck
in the drive-through.

04:30.646 --> 04:31.646
- Oh, shut up!

04:31.688 --> 04:33.774
What can I say?
I'm just a nice guy.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.025
People love me.

04:35.150 --> 04:36.902
Welcome to lady Liberty.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.505
Would you like to try
our new triple Patty

04:38.529 --> 04:40.614
bacon blasted combo for 5.99?

04:40.697 --> 04:41.448
- Yeah.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.116
I'll have a smokehouse burger.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.078
Take some fries, put
'em on the burger,

04:46.245 --> 04:48.622
then cut that bitch in half.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.874
- Uh, we don't do that here.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.251
- What?

04:52.334 --> 04:54.294
- I said we don't do that here.

04:55.087 --> 04:56.588
Special orders.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.966
♪ We about to act up ♪

05:02.386 --> 05:05.347
- Yo bro, you can't
cut it in half?

05:05.430 --> 05:07.182
You got knives, don't you?

05:07.391 --> 05:09.810
You got hands, so what's
the fucking problem?

05:09.977 --> 05:13.188
- Yeah, we just serve the
food here as advertised, is all.

05:13.564 --> 05:15.732
You see the whip I'm driving?

05:15.816 --> 05:17.609
- Yeah.
- You see the clothes I'm wearing?

05:17.734 --> 05:21.029
Does it look like I give a
shit what you usually do?

05:21.280 --> 05:23.031
- Okay. So let me
get this straight.

05:23.115 --> 05:24.950
You think because
I'm serving you

05:25.033 --> 05:27.202
that I'm your servant, right?

05:28.078 --> 05:29.246
- You understand this?

05:29.830 --> 05:30.830
Huh?

05:31.206 --> 05:32.541
<i>Habla dinero?</i>

05:33.000 --> 05:34.418
Lameass wetback.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.838
- Wetback. Ooh, wetback?

05:37.921 --> 05:41.091
Okay, so you've been a racist
your whole life, I'm guessing.

05:41.216 --> 05:42.342
And you're telling me

05:42.426 --> 05:45.095
the best you can
come up with is wetback?

05:45.179 --> 05:46.179
Really?

05:47.055 --> 05:49.266
Why don't I give you
a little help here? Excuse me.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.684
Customers of lady Liberty,

05:50.767 --> 05:52.644
can I have your
attention, please?

05:52.728 --> 05:54.848
I have these two lovely
gentlemen here in front of me,

05:54.897 --> 05:57.983
and they're wondering if we
have any wetbacks here tonight.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.151
- What are you doing?

05:59.234 --> 06:01.236
- Do we have any beaners here?

06:01.320 --> 06:02.920
Any greasers-
- can I just get my burger?

06:02.946 --> 06:04.072
- What about some vatos

06:04.156 --> 06:06.200
or some cholos, huh?
Motor bandits.

06:06.283 --> 06:09.244
- Hey, go back to where
you came from, bro.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.248
- Thank you valued customer.
- Have a nice day.

06:14.625 --> 06:18.086
- Hey! Making friends, I see.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.797
Dang, such a social butterfly.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.150
- You know me, girl,
just gotta call out

06:22.174 --> 06:23.091
the haters of the world.

06:23.175 --> 06:24.259
- Okay.

06:24.343 --> 06:25.469
- Oh, and Andrea look,

06:25.552 --> 06:26.905
I got this very special
milkshake for you.

06:26.929 --> 06:28.597
- Oh, I'm vegan.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.140
- She vegan, bro.
- You're vegan?

06:30.349 --> 06:31.391
- Sorry.

06:31.475 --> 06:32.643
- Girl, I'm an aquarius,

06:32.726 --> 06:34.954
I think the universe might be
trying to tell us something, huh?

06:34.978 --> 06:36.104
- Do you feel that?

06:36.438 --> 06:37.773
- It's in the air or something.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.816
- I can almost hear it.
- Please stop.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.336
- Oh, shh, we're having a moment.
- Shh, shh!

06:41.360 --> 06:42.277
- I hear it too.

06:42.361 --> 06:43.237
What is that? What is that?

06:43.320 --> 06:45.948
- Jp, code 12 in the bathroom.

06:46.198 --> 06:47.741
Someone clogged
the shitter again.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.553
- Nice try, twerp.
- I'll take that.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.497
Oh, mom wants us home at eight.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.916
- Try to make that.
- Wait, why eight?

06:55.999 --> 06:56.792
- You didn't hear?

06:56.875 --> 06:59.086
Lily got into Columbia!

06:59.169 --> 07:00.003
- Girl.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.255
Oh, not now.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.924
- Oh god, I'm so sorry.
- I didn't realise. I'm so sorry.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.593
- You got into Columbia?

07:06.677 --> 07:07.886
- Yeah.

07:07.970 --> 07:08.970
- Isn't that kinda far?

07:09.137 --> 07:10.597
Come on, move it.

07:10.681 --> 07:12.116
- You got some people
in the back here.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.226
Don't worry about it.
I love you, loser!

07:14.309 --> 07:15.477
- Bye! Love you, bye!

07:19.439 --> 07:21.233
- So, when were
you gonna tell me?

07:21.316 --> 07:22.734
- Aren't you happy for her?

07:22.818 --> 07:25.946
- Yeah, it's just like
New York is far away, so...

07:27.114 --> 07:28.740
- She will always
be there for you.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.409
You'll be there for her tonight?

07:30.492 --> 07:32.327
- Yeah, of course
I'm gonna be there.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.082
I love you too.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.300
Hello?

07:48.510 --> 07:50.387
- Get down on the
motherfucking ground!

07:50.596 --> 07:51.680
- Shit!

07:53.182 --> 07:55.767
- Say hello to worldstar, pussy.

07:55.893 --> 07:57.436
- Scott Williams of riverside

07:57.519 --> 07:59.313
once sharted
in third period French.

07:59.396 --> 08:00.606
- Come on, man.

08:00.689 --> 08:01.732
Low blow.

08:02.441 --> 08:03.817
Never should have told you that.

08:03.901 --> 08:04.902
- Nope.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.047
- Well, so anyway, I heard
your sis got into college.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.239
- Yeah.

08:09.323 --> 08:10.741
- How you holding up?

08:10.866 --> 08:13.136
- It's always been her dream
to get into an Ivy league school.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.160
So that's pretty good.

08:14.203 --> 08:15.204
I'm happy for her there.

08:15.287 --> 08:17.748
And now we got a place to
stay in the big apple, huh?

08:17.831 --> 08:20.501
And college parties and
girls, it's gonna be lit.

08:20.584 --> 08:21.668
- My man.

08:21.752 --> 08:24.129
You know, I cannot wait to
give one of those rich girls

08:24.213 --> 08:28.884
the famous Scott's
special.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.637
- What does that even look like?
- Two inches of regret?

08:32.261 --> 08:34.347
- Dude, I'm a five and half.
- Sure. Right.

08:34.431 --> 08:35.432
Let's go with that.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.643
- And according to cosmo,
that shit is average.

08:37.976 --> 08:40.062
You're gonna help me load
these into the freezer?

08:44.107 --> 08:45.442
- It's like that, is it?

08:45.526 --> 08:46.902
No, that's cool. That's cool.

08:46.985 --> 08:49.404
I'll just smoke this joint
with my real friends.

09:03.836 --> 09:06.255
I saw that milkshake
move with Andrea.

09:06.338 --> 09:07.798
- Oh yeah?
- Weak.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.241
- Dude, what are
you talking about?

09:09.299 --> 09:10.551
Everybody loves milkshakes.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.094
- Nah, for real, dude.

09:12.177 --> 09:13.971
You gotta step up your game.

09:14.054 --> 09:17.015
- Do we even serve anything
that a vegan can eat?

09:19.685 --> 09:20.769
- Uh, pickles?

09:24.314 --> 09:25.607
Shit, no, no. I love a pickle.

09:25.691 --> 09:28.277
I just, I prefer it on
a slab of dead cow.

09:30.696 --> 09:31.738
- Later, man.

09:33.365 --> 09:35.784
I don't care what he says,
everybody loves milkshakes.

09:36.285 --> 09:37.536
That was my joint.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.120
♪ just finished taking out ♪

10:20.204 --> 10:23.582
- Hey, look alive, baby boy.

10:24.791 --> 10:25.792
Oh, wow.

10:27.252 --> 10:31.298
Yo, anybody ever tell you
you have resting dumb face?

10:31.381 --> 10:32.758
- You just salty, all right?

10:32.841 --> 10:34.468
Because you're jealous.

10:34.885 --> 10:36.446
- Okay, I'm gonna send
this to Andrea then.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.070
- Why you gotta do me
like that? Come on.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.949
Hey, you don't see me
knock your hustle, do you?

10:39.973 --> 10:41.725
- Hashtag, is your
brain on tide pods?

10:44.770 --> 10:45.979
- Very savage.

10:46.063 --> 10:47.540
But you know what,
I'm gonna let it slide

10:47.564 --> 10:50.192
'cause it's your big day
and all that, okay?

10:50.275 --> 10:51.193
- That's right!

10:51.276 --> 10:53.612
- My sis going to Columbia.

10:53.904 --> 10:55.155
- Columbia.

10:55.239 --> 10:56.382
It looks like I got the looks

10:56.406 --> 10:57.574
and the brains of the family.

10:57.658 --> 11:00.160
Ooh, a lot of pressure
on my shoulders.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.746
- Gotta take care of us.
- Oh, do you now?

11:02.829 --> 11:03.829
- Yes.

11:05.624 --> 11:08.252
- Hey, I'm proud of you.

11:09.127 --> 11:10.212
- Okay, who are you?

11:10.379 --> 11:11.523
- Not like I'd be caught dead

11:11.547 --> 11:14.550
with any of those nerd bombers.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.760
- Ew, nerd bombers?
- But it suits you.

11:16.844 --> 11:19.680
Your whole aesthetic,
very nerd bomber-esque.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.682
- You could go to
college as well.

11:23.225 --> 11:24.351
Lily, Lily, Lily.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.644
Lemme tell you something.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.521
Lemme put you on game
real quick, all right?

11:27.604 --> 11:30.190
There are two kinds of
people in this world.

11:30.274 --> 11:31.567
There are workers.

11:31.775 --> 11:32.776
Oh, yes sir. No, sir.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.003
And they do that
their whole lives.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.171
And then you got the hustlers.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.589
They be doing it for
a little bit of time.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.493
They're there, but then
they're always thinking.

11:38.532 --> 11:39.658
They gotta find a way out.

11:39.741 --> 11:41.285
They're percolating in the head.

11:41.785 --> 11:42.828
That's me.

11:43.245 --> 11:44.597
- I don't even know
what that means.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.707
- It means I'm a buy mom
a big ass house

11:46.790 --> 11:48.041
before you even graduate.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.209
- Oh, really?

11:49.293 --> 11:50.961
With all that
lady Liberty money?

11:51.086 --> 11:52.796
Oh, 'cause you balling now

11:52.880 --> 11:54.756
'cause you on
that burger chains?

11:55.299 --> 11:56.925
- More like that burger chain.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.094
- Uh... wrong.

11:59.845 --> 12:01.471
Here, let's take a
picture for mami.

12:01.555 --> 12:02.681
Let me fix my hair.

12:06.018 --> 12:09.521
- Girl, what do you got
there behind your ear?

12:09.605 --> 12:11.040
- Nothing.
- What are you talking about?

12:11.064 --> 12:13.150
- Behind your ear?
- Jp, just...

12:15.194 --> 12:16.195
- You get some ink?

12:16.278 --> 12:18.405
- Jp, not a word.

12:19.823 --> 12:22.117
- Snitches get stitches.
- Uh-huh. This is cute.

12:22.284 --> 12:23.284
Come on.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.578
- Butterfly though, really?

12:24.661 --> 12:26.413
- Okay, because it's
my spirit animal.

12:26.496 --> 12:27.581
- Isn't that kind of basic?

12:30.417 --> 12:31.543
Spirit animal?

12:32.085 --> 12:34.254
Isn't a butterfly an insect?

12:58.195 --> 12:59.446
- Oh, look at that.

12:59.655 --> 13:00.656
Cute.

13:01.073 --> 13:02.073
Very nice.

13:03.742 --> 13:06.703
Loser.

13:13.168 --> 13:17.256
And I'm very happy to share
my joy with everyone here.

13:18.382 --> 13:20.384
Lily, I couldn't be
more proud of you.

13:20.634 --> 13:21.969
- <i>Salute.
- Salute.</i>

13:22.052 --> 13:23.846
<i>Salute.</i>

13:24.304 --> 13:28.183
- Lily, you deserve to enjoy
every moment of happiness

13:28.308 --> 13:29.852
that surely lies ahead of you.

13:30.102 --> 13:31.311
And start with this one, mija.

13:31.395 --> 13:32.395
Ay, mami!

13:34.815 --> 13:36.483
- It's okay, mom, really.

13:36.567 --> 13:38.235
I'm just gonna be
a phone call away.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.528
Besides, jp's gonna be here.

13:39.611 --> 13:42.322
He's gonna be
handling it, right jp?

13:42.698 --> 13:44.058
You promise to take
care of things?

13:46.410 --> 13:47.452
- Immigration, get down!

13:49.746 --> 13:51.456
- Please, don't!
- Show your hands!

14:03.302 --> 14:04.928
- Hey! Lily!

14:05.596 --> 14:07.848
- Please, no... please! No!

14:13.353 --> 14:14.688
- This just in from the capital.

14:14.771 --> 14:17.482
Governor Finn has declared
a sudden state of emergency,

14:17.566 --> 14:20.611
issuing a surprise
executive order.

14:23.197 --> 14:25.490
- Issuing a surprise
executive order

14:25.574 --> 14:27.993
commanding the task
forces across the state

14:28.076 --> 14:30.954
to carry out widespread arrests
of illegal immigrants,

14:31.038 --> 14:33.957
in what many are calling
a blatant political ploy

14:34.041 --> 14:35.584
to galvanize his base

14:35.667 --> 14:37.878
before the upcoming
gubernatorial election.

14:38.003 --> 14:39.463
- As a civil rights lawyer,

14:39.546 --> 14:41.381
but more importantly
as a human being

14:41.465 --> 14:42.716
and someone's daughter,

14:42.799 --> 14:45.469
i find this executive order
just atrocious.

14:45.719 --> 14:48.347
- In response to estimates
that nearly two million

14:48.430 --> 14:50.682
illegal immigrants live
in just his state alone...

14:54.394 --> 14:57.022
- Governor Finn has
issued an executive order,

14:57.105 --> 15:00.067
commanding task forces
to arrest the children

15:00.150 --> 15:01.860
of these immigrants as well,

15:01.944 --> 15:04.571
even if they were born
here in the United States.

15:04.655 --> 15:06.615
- For aiding and
abetting their parents

15:06.698 --> 15:08.534
by not reporting
them to authorities.

15:08.784 --> 15:11.328
- I have only two words to
say about our recent efforts

15:11.411 --> 15:14.623
to expel illegal aliens
from our beautiful state.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.167
Zero tolerance.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.222
- Single file line.

15:34.810 --> 15:35.978
No phone calls.

15:56.331 --> 15:57.457
- Assholes!

15:57.666 --> 15:58.542
- Stop!

15:58.625 --> 16:00.210
- Let go of me!

16:00.377 --> 16:01.587
Assholes.

16:02.921 --> 16:05.883
- Come on, let's go! Move it!
- I just wanna see my family again...

16:06.967 --> 16:07.967
- Lily?

16:08.093 --> 16:09.093
Lily!

16:11.638 --> 16:13.015
Lily, it's me. It's jp.

16:13.891 --> 16:14.933
Lily!

16:15.100 --> 16:16.435
Lily! Lily!

17:54.741 --> 17:55.868
I saw you on TV.

17:55.951 --> 17:57.494
You're the one trying
to get the judge

17:57.619 --> 17:59.329
to overrule the governor, right?

17:59.413 --> 18:01.164
- It's overturn.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.124
And yes.

18:06.920 --> 18:07.920
We lost.

18:09.339 --> 18:11.049
We're not done
fighting yet though.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.427
We'll appeal to the supreme
court if we have to.

18:13.802 --> 18:15.053
- How long does that take?

18:15.971 --> 18:17.598
- Hard to say.

18:17.973 --> 18:20.100
Weeks, months maybe.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.810
- This is bullshit.

18:21.894 --> 18:23.896
- Governor Finn will do
everything in his power

18:23.979 --> 18:26.148
to drag this out
until the election.

18:26.398 --> 18:27.584
Children of illegal immigrants

18:27.608 --> 18:30.194
aren't exactly known
for voting republican.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.237
- What? Is that a crime now?

18:32.863 --> 18:37.367
- No, but aiding and
abetting an illegal alien is.

18:37.534 --> 18:39.494
- You mean being
raised by my mom?

18:39.578 --> 18:41.622
What? Is my sister
like an accomplice now?

18:41.705 --> 18:43.040
- Listen to me, jp.

18:43.207 --> 18:45.209
Governor Finn wants all the
detained immigrants

18:45.292 --> 18:46.502
gone by election day.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.587
- Gone, like deported?

18:49.505 --> 18:51.590
They wanna deport my
mom just like that?

18:54.801 --> 18:56.720
- Now, we can stop
that from happening.

18:57.763 --> 19:00.349
If a natural born American
citizen claims her

19:00.432 --> 19:04.311
as a member of their biological
family, she'll be released.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.813
- Me and Lily, problem solved.

19:06.897 --> 19:10.108
- No. As long as you and your sister
remain under state custody,

19:10.192 --> 19:12.736
you can't bring forward
any legal claims.

19:18.450 --> 19:19.650
But we do have another option.

19:30.295 --> 19:31.296
- What's this?

19:31.505 --> 19:35.133
- The elderly American tolerance
and understanding project.

19:35.467 --> 19:36.844
This community service program

19:36.927 --> 19:40.097
where volunteers help
care for senior citizens.

19:40.681 --> 19:43.225
The da is offering
to drop all charges

19:43.308 --> 19:44.643
if you complete this program.

19:49.773 --> 19:52.192
- So it's this or go to court?

19:54.528 --> 19:55.737
- Choice is yours.

19:57.990 --> 19:58.991
- No, it isn't.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.077
- You all know why you're here.

20:02.494 --> 20:04.913
Successful completion
of this program

20:04.997 --> 20:08.709
is your only chance to
return to your normal lives

20:09.209 --> 20:10.794
and your families.

20:10.878 --> 20:12.337
- Juan Pablo valdes.

20:12.421 --> 20:14.214
That's valdes with
an s, not a z.

20:14.298 --> 20:15.358
Here, I'll spell that for you.

20:15.382 --> 20:19.970
G-o-f-u-c-k-y-o-u-r-s-e-l-f.

20:21.180 --> 20:22.681
See? No z.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.892
Camilla montes.

20:24.975 --> 20:27.978
Full-time activist,
part-time political prisoner.

20:29.438 --> 20:31.190
- What's your country of origin?

20:32.441 --> 20:36.486
- I'm a red-blooded American,
but my mom is from Mexico.

20:36.695 --> 20:39.323
- While you are a
participant in this program,

20:39.406 --> 20:42.910
there will be no communication
with the outside world.

20:43.118 --> 20:44.244
- Chris morales.

20:46.163 --> 20:48.582
I got chronic anxiety
and delusional paranoia.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.710
Is it really hot in here?

20:51.793 --> 20:53.879
Is there even windows in here?

20:53.962 --> 20:54.880
There's no air in this room.

20:54.963 --> 20:56.507
My throat gets super dry...

20:56.590 --> 20:58.091
- There's water
there if you'd like.

20:58.217 --> 20:59.217
- Dude, what's in it?

20:59.259 --> 21:01.428
LSD? Flunitrazepam.

21:01.553 --> 21:02.679
- No.
- One mistake.

21:04.097 --> 21:08.352
And I will personally
drag your ass back here.

21:09.603 --> 21:11.355
- They call me big Mac.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.649
Know what I'm talking about?
You wanna know why?

21:13.732 --> 21:15.484
'Cause I'll be
macking the big hoes.

21:15.776 --> 21:16.902
The bbw.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.196
Big ladies need love too.

21:20.489 --> 21:21.823
- What's your country of origin?

21:23.534 --> 21:27.162
- Am I in here because
I'm latino or black?

21:27.913 --> 21:28.913
Or both?

21:29.873 --> 21:30.873
Confusing?

21:30.958 --> 21:32.835
- These ankle
monitors will alert us

21:32.918 --> 21:35.879
if you're not in your assigned
rooms by curfew.

21:35.963 --> 21:38.757
If it starts beeping,
you have five minutes

21:38.841 --> 21:41.260
to haul ass back to your room.

21:41.927 --> 21:44.972
- Micah Fuentes, gluten-free
vegan, democrat socialist.

21:45.055 --> 21:46.515
Is that a crime yet?

21:46.974 --> 21:48.267
- What's your country of origin?

21:48.517 --> 21:51.061
- United States of Americas,
argentinian parents.

21:51.144 --> 21:54.773
But you can just write down
divided states of america.

21:55.691 --> 21:57.001
- You ever been affiliated
with a gang

21:57.025 --> 21:59.236
or any violent organization?

21:59.319 --> 22:02.698
- Housekeepers, landscapers,
busboys, construction workers.

22:02.781 --> 22:05.158
We get together in secret,

22:05.242 --> 22:08.620
and we work the jobs that
nobody else wants to do

22:09.121 --> 22:11.248
for less than minimum wage.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.333

22:16.336 --> 22:17.336
Lithium.

22:17.462 --> 22:18.964

racist shit though.

22:19.298 --> 22:20.716
To assume that I use drugs.

22:20.883 --> 22:22.759
- Clozapine, risperidone,
Xanax and Adderall.

22:23.010 --> 22:25.179
- Do I assume you dance
poorly to vanilla ice,

22:25.262 --> 22:26.597
dressed in your khaki shorts

22:26.680 --> 22:28.390
while stress eating
a Kale salad?

22:28.473 --> 22:30.309
- And sometimes it
balances with carbamazepine

22:30.434 --> 22:33.145
and diboplorex.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.357
- Do you have a criminal record?

22:37.566 --> 22:38.817
- Of course I do.

22:39.985 --> 22:41.445
Y'all wanna know what I did?

22:43.363 --> 22:46.158
I stole hearts in the
fourth grade.

- And if any of you geniuses
decide to try and escape,

24:07.239 --> 24:08.574
- Thank you, Bruce.

24:09.449 --> 24:14.121
At alcove, compassionate
elder care is our mission.

24:14.997 --> 24:16.123
It's what we do.

24:16.415 --> 24:18.083
So we truly appreciate
you being here

24:18.250 --> 24:22.838
to help out our seniors in
so many ways, big and small,

24:23.422 --> 24:24.882
but maybe they can help you too.

24:26.175 --> 24:30.387
I mean, the truth is we
all have so much to learn

24:30.470 --> 24:32.931
from our most
experienced citizens.

24:33.015 --> 24:35.225
And I promise you, you
stick with the program,

24:35.309 --> 24:38.562
you're gonna leave this place
more mature, fully grown.

24:38.645 --> 24:42.482
You may even gain a newfound
appreciation for life.

24:46.695 --> 24:48.673
I'm gonna turn you over to
our operations officers,

24:48.697 --> 24:49.865
Cynthia and James.

24:49.948 --> 24:51.676
And I just wanna remind
you that you are doing

24:51.700 --> 24:54.995
the residents of alcove
and your country,

24:55.704 --> 24:56.872
a tremendous service.

25:00.501 --> 25:01.585
Thank you.

25:02.419 --> 25:04.022
All right guys, listen up.

25:04.046 --> 25:05.672
I'm gonna show you guys' room,

25:05.756 --> 25:07.132
where you'll be
sleeping at night.

25:07.216 --> 25:09.760
It's nothing fancy as you
will see, but let's be honest.

25:09.843 --> 25:11.845
Between this and
foil sleeping bags,

25:11.929 --> 25:13.639
I know which one I'd choose.

25:13.722 --> 25:16.934
You got the essentials,
your bed, desk, lamp.

25:17.017 --> 25:19.436
We'll get you anything
you need, just ask us.

25:19.520 --> 25:21.271
Better be in there before curfew

25:21.355 --> 25:22.856
or your ankle bracelet
will go off...

25:25.943 --> 25:28.153
- Water therapy
and aqua aerobics.

25:28.237 --> 25:31.156
- Yes, the pool is heated
and no, you may not use it

25:31.240 --> 25:32.741
under any circumstances.

25:33.158 --> 25:34.535
- Relaxation is big here.

25:34.618 --> 25:35.911
So no matter what happens,

25:35.994 --> 25:38.705
it's very important that
the guests remain calm.

25:43.752 --> 25:45.087
The common area.

25:45.170 --> 25:47.714
This is the true heartbeat
of our operation.

25:48.131 --> 25:49.931
- This is where you'll
spend most of your time

25:49.967 --> 25:51.218
entertaining our guests.

25:51.301 --> 25:54.721
Your job is to play chess,
read to them, blah, blah, blah.

26:01.103 --> 26:02.604
- Hey, big Mac. Keep up.

26:03.647 --> 26:04.857
This is our garden.

26:04.940 --> 26:06.859
It's very popular
with the residents.

26:06.942 --> 26:08.753
As you will see, they'll
come out here to relax,

26:08.777 --> 26:10.821
close their eyes and meditate.

26:10.904 --> 26:12.781
By meditate, I just
mean take a nap.

26:16.952 --> 26:19.037
Think that you'll find if
you stick to the program,

26:19.121 --> 26:21.373
follow the rules
and stay in line,

26:21.456 --> 26:23.876
your time here should be pretty
fast and easy, all right?

26:25.294 --> 26:26.753
- Look at this. Look at this.

26:26.837 --> 26:28.005
Well, I be damned!

26:28.297 --> 26:30.883
How am I supposed to maintain
my superior intellect

26:30.966 --> 26:33.385
eating this nasty ass meat loaf?

26:34.261 --> 26:35.846
Hey. Psst!

26:35.929 --> 26:36.930
White girl.

26:37.181 --> 26:38.098
White girl.

26:38.182 --> 26:39.975
- Is he talking to me?
- He's talking to you.

26:40.434 --> 26:41.935
- I suggest you say something.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.855
You know, 'cause your skin.

26:45.397 --> 26:47.316
- 'Cause us white people like...

26:47.566 --> 26:48.567
- Yeah.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.402
I'm argentinian,.

26:50.527 --> 26:51.987
- So, you're not white?

26:53.363 --> 26:54.615
- Dude, all these old people,

26:54.698 --> 26:56.867
do we have to, like, touch them?

26:57.034 --> 26:59.244
- Do you realize how
dumb you sound right now?

26:59.953 --> 27:01.747
You're gonna be old one day.

27:01.830 --> 27:03.725
- We put my grandpa in a
nursing home and he loved it

27:03.749 --> 27:04.833
'cause he got so much ass,

27:04.917 --> 27:06.877
'cause every old lady
in there was dtf.

27:06.960 --> 27:07.960
All of 'em.

27:08.003 --> 27:10.005
- Okay, you know what, we
really don't wanna hear

27:10.088 --> 27:11.808
about your granddaddy
fornicating right now.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.383
- Yeah, grandpa died
five weeks later.

27:13.467 --> 27:14.667
And when they did the autopsy,

27:14.718 --> 27:16.637
they found like seven
different stds on him.

27:16.720 --> 27:19.890
Full head of herpes sore
at the funeral like...

27:21.558 --> 27:23.810
No, my point is, you
wanna get gonorrhea,

27:23.894 --> 27:25.771
go ahead and touch a
few of these geezers.

27:25.854 --> 27:27.814
- You don't gotta touch
'em with your dick.

27:28.065 --> 27:29.650
- Um... speak for yourself,

27:29.816 --> 27:32.444
'cause I might want some
of that fermented vagina.

27:32.528 --> 27:33.630
You know what I'm talk about?

27:33.654 --> 27:35.614
- Stop talking about
old people sex.

27:35.739 --> 27:36.907
- You started it.

27:36.990 --> 27:38.492
- You know what I want?

27:39.493 --> 27:44.498
I would kill for a lady
libs fish fillet right now.

27:45.541 --> 27:47.042
- It's not fish though.

27:47.751 --> 27:49.795
- Say what? What you
mean it's not fish?

27:50.170 --> 27:51.797
- What's in my fillet?

27:51.964 --> 27:53.215
You don't wanna know.

27:53.340 --> 27:54.466
- That's why I'm vegan.

27:54.550 --> 27:56.343
- I only eat what my mom cooks.

27:56.426 --> 27:58.762
She's the only person I
trust not to poison me.

27:58.846 --> 27:59.864
- Okay, so you're
not eating that?

27:59.888 --> 28:01.473
- No, man. Or drinking.

28:01.557 --> 28:02.683
That's how they get you.

28:02.766 --> 28:04.351
- Would you all just shut up!

28:05.769 --> 28:07.354
This isn't summer camp.

28:07.938 --> 28:09.606
- What is wrong with her?

28:10.399 --> 28:12.276
She know what's in that
fish fillet, don't she?

28:12.359 --> 28:13.359
- All right.

28:13.402 --> 28:15.988
Time for you guys to
look the part. Come on.

28:22.411 --> 28:24.955
- Well, pick your poison.

28:25.038 --> 28:28.333
Erectile dysfunction or
irritable bowel system?

28:28.417 --> 28:29.585
- It's syndrome.

28:29.668 --> 28:30.836
- Same thing.

28:31.545 --> 28:32.546
- Great.

28:33.213 --> 28:34.493
- Wow, where's my
man with the...

28:34.548 --> 28:35.674
There you go.

28:45.934 --> 28:46.935
- Hey.

28:47.144 --> 28:51.398
Uh, I'm jp and I'm here
with the...

28:53.650 --> 28:55.611
The program, I guess.

28:55.986 --> 28:58.113
So if you need
anything or like...

28:59.031 --> 29:00.031
You...

29:00.157 --> 29:02.284
- Hey sweetie,
we're here to help.

29:04.244 --> 29:05.244
- What do we do?

29:08.123 --> 29:09.208
- Here.

29:09.291 --> 29:10.501
We can read to them.

29:12.294 --> 29:14.213
Oh god, please tell me
you know how to read.

29:16.006 --> 29:17.674
- No, yeah. I know how to read.

29:17.841 --> 29:19.468
I can... I could read.

29:19.593 --> 29:21.303
- That doesn't sound
convincing at all.

29:21.470 --> 29:23.847
- I'll read.
- I know how to say words if...

29:24.932 --> 29:25.974
- Good luck.

29:30.979 --> 29:32.397
- This is stupid.

29:33.482 --> 29:34.358
Not you.

29:34.441 --> 29:35.441
Oh.

29:36.485 --> 29:37.778
Sorry.

29:37.861 --> 29:39.154
I'll just read.

29:41.323 --> 29:42.323
You know.

29:45.661 --> 29:49.748
He thought back on his family
with deep emotion and love.

29:49.831 --> 29:51.792
His conviction that he
would have to disappear

29:51.875 --> 29:54.503
was, if possible, even firmer
than his sister's.

29:57.673 --> 29:59.883
I cannot make you understand.

30:00.008 --> 30:03.929
I cannot make anyone understand
what is happening inside me.

30:04.012 --> 30:07.266
I cannot even explain to myself-
- you will die here.

30:07.349 --> 30:08.725
- Sorry?

30:09.059 --> 30:10.978
- You will die here.

30:11.061 --> 30:13.814
- I can... I can
pick another book.

30:13.897 --> 30:17.317
You will die here.

30:17.526 --> 30:19.361
You will die here.

30:20.821 --> 30:21.947
- Back off. Back off.

30:22.489 --> 30:23.615
You've done enough.

30:23.782 --> 30:25.782
- I was just reading a book-
- don't wanna hear it.

30:25.826 --> 30:29.204
- Doesn't... where are
you guys taking her?

30:31.290 --> 30:32.833
- Smooth.

30:34.084 --> 30:35.961
You really got a way
with the ladies.

30:40.507 --> 30:42.759
- Chris, you should
really eat something.

30:42.843 --> 30:44.094
- No. No way.

30:44.178 --> 30:45.470
They're not gonna break me.

30:45.679 --> 30:46.865
- At least have some water, man.

30:46.889 --> 30:48.324
You're not gonna last
unless you hydrate.

30:48.348 --> 30:50.034
- I won't have to, 'cause
I'm getting outta here.

30:50.058 --> 30:52.058
- What are you talking about?
- You trying to escape?

30:52.102 --> 30:53.228
Yeah, good luck with that.

30:55.981 --> 30:57.024
- What?

31:04.573 --> 31:06.173
- They're probably
watching us right now.

31:06.241 --> 31:07.510
They're waiting to
see if any of us

31:07.534 --> 31:08.869
have the nerve to defy them.

31:08.952 --> 31:09.953
- Who's they?

31:10.078 --> 31:11.914
- Exactly. Who are they?

31:11.997 --> 31:13.165
I don't know. You don't know.

31:13.248 --> 31:14.458
Maybe they don't even know.

31:14.583 --> 31:15.959
- You've gotta be kidding.

31:16.043 --> 31:17.854
- Do you honestly think
it's crazy to try to escape?

31:17.878 --> 31:20.005
You know, I don't care
if I look crazy, all right?

31:20.088 --> 31:21.191
- Oh, you sure the hell don't.

31:21.215 --> 31:22.901
- Why don't you just stop
talking all this shit

31:22.925 --> 31:24.134
and go try it then?

31:24.760 --> 31:26.053
- You know, maybe I will.

31:26.136 --> 31:28.347
- No, Chris. Chris.
- You're a little fragile right now.

31:28.430 --> 31:29.806
You're hangry, Chris!

31:29.890 --> 31:31.642
- I don't think you should do it.
- Chris.

31:32.017 --> 31:33.477
Don't do that. Don't...

31:38.857 --> 31:39.937
- Yeah, it was an accident.

31:39.983 --> 31:40.984
I tripped. I'm sorry.

31:41.068 --> 31:42.736
Oh.

31:46.657 --> 31:48.367
Oh, you know
he pissed on himself.

31:48.450 --> 31:49.826
- Let go of me.

31:50.327 --> 31:51.537
No. No...

31:51.620 --> 31:53.038
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Moron.

31:53.121 --> 31:55.082
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

33:32.179 --> 33:33.179
- Virgil.

33:35.057 --> 33:36.391
Will set you free.

33:38.185 --> 33:39.811
It's Virgil.

33:42.564 --> 33:43.857
Virgil.

33:45.108 --> 33:47.194
Virgil will set you free.

33:47.819 --> 33:49.696
Virgil will set you free.

33:56.995 --> 33:58.997
- Relax, it's okay.
- Virgil.

33:59.081 --> 34:00.999
- It's okay.
- Set you free.

34:01.083 --> 34:02.835
- Virgil.
- Hey, hey, hey it's okay.

34:02.918 --> 34:05.504
- Will set you free. Free!

34:05.587 --> 34:06.587
Hey...

34:08.382 --> 34:10.842
Virgil will set you free.

34:11.051 --> 34:13.262
Virgil will set you free.

34:13.344 --> 34:14.904
- Virgil will set you free.
- I found her.

34:15.222 --> 34:16.264
She's here.

34:16.431 --> 34:18.141
Mrs. Wells, stop it.

34:19.059 --> 34:21.018
- All right, let's
get her off of him.

34:26.859 --> 34:27.900
- It's okay.

34:27.985 --> 34:29.527
Just come with us.

34:29.862 --> 34:31.196
Go back to your room.

34:31.446 --> 34:32.989
- Nice job, black bean.

34:33.364 --> 34:34.741
Get in your damn room.

34:35.242 --> 34:36.242
Now!

34:36.952 --> 34:38.829
Make sure her door's
locked this time.

34:50.382 --> 34:53.510
- I wanna apologize for what
happened to jp last night.

34:53.594 --> 34:55.262
That never shoulda happened.

34:56.179 --> 34:58.891
You guys should probably see
the entire facility now.

35:00.267 --> 35:01.268
- Where's Chris?

35:03.437 --> 35:05.147
- Don't even look at me.

35:06.440 --> 35:07.482
- This is ward b.

35:07.649 --> 35:10.027
All of our residents
here have been diagnosed

35:10.110 --> 35:12.446
with advanced dementia
or Alzheimer's.

35:13.071 --> 35:14.823
As you can see,
they tend to regress

35:14.907 --> 35:16.742
back to their natural instincts.

35:17.159 --> 35:20.954
Unfortunately, our role here
is a purely palliative one.

35:21.163 --> 35:22.247
- Meaning what?

35:22.831 --> 35:24.666
- Keep 'em comfortable,
spoon feed 'em,

35:25.000 --> 35:26.418
wipe their asses till they die.

35:26.668 --> 35:29.004
- That's morbid,
Camilla, but not wrong.

35:29.630 --> 35:32.591
Anyway, someone left the
door unlocked last night.

35:33.175 --> 35:34.384
Thus our wanderer.

35:34.676 --> 35:36.094
- Can we help them instead?

35:36.803 --> 35:38.072
- Oh, sure. You
can assist James.

35:38.096 --> 35:39.473
He'll show you what to do.

35:40.140 --> 35:41.892
Why not?

35:41.975 --> 35:43.769
- Anyway, back to work everyone.

35:45.646 --> 35:46.688
- Thanks.

35:46.772 --> 35:48.023
- Kiss ass.

35:48.941 --> 35:50.108
All right.

35:50.192 --> 35:52.277
Mr. Yates here, we gotta
get him outta this chair

35:52.361 --> 35:53.361
and into a bed.

35:53.695 --> 35:54.905
Think you can handle that?

35:55.822 --> 35:57.616
- Yeah, sure.
- Good.

36:07.835 --> 36:09.002
- So why is he strapped in?

36:09.419 --> 36:10.671
- It's for his own good.

36:11.338 --> 36:14.925
Mr. Yates here
is a bit of a biter,

36:16.718 --> 36:17.718
aren't ya?

36:18.679 --> 36:20.472
Probably eat me alive.

36:21.265 --> 36:22.558
- Stupid old fuck.

36:22.683 --> 36:25.018
- Hey, don't do that.

36:25.561 --> 36:26.687
- Chill, hombre.

36:26.770 --> 36:28.206
Just having some fun.

36:28.230 --> 36:30.190
- Hey man, don't call me hombre.

36:30.274 --> 36:31.650
- Don't call you what?

36:33.068 --> 36:35.279
Kid, I'll call
you hombre, chico,

36:35.362 --> 36:38.866
nacho, burrito, or whatever
the fuck else I wanna call you.

36:38.949 --> 36:40.367
<i>Comprehende, amigo?</i>

36:40.450 --> 36:41.511
- Better back off, supercuts.

36:41.535 --> 36:42.535
- Or what?

36:42.578 --> 36:44.037
- Everything okay?

36:45.455 --> 36:46.623
- Absolutely, Eddie.

36:47.165 --> 36:49.168
Just showing jp here the ropes.

36:49.543 --> 36:50.543
All good.

36:55.174 --> 36:57.301
Welcome to my shit list, bitch.

36:58.302 --> 37:00.345
Now, help me put
this old fuck to bed.

37:00.429 --> 37:01.429
Now.

37:04.850 --> 37:06.101
Get his strap.

37:14.359 --> 37:15.235
- Fuck!

37:15.319 --> 37:17.196
Get off me! Get off.

37:18.238 --> 37:19.448
Hey, hey, stop.

37:20.073 --> 37:21.073
Stop!

37:21.533 --> 37:22.576
Don't hurt him...

37:51.730 --> 37:52.730
Lily?

37:54.525 --> 37:55.609
Lily.

38:02.366 --> 38:03.408
But how?

38:04.826 --> 38:06.537
You're not gonna believe it,

38:06.620 --> 38:08.747
But turns out we've only
been like a mile apart

38:08.830 --> 38:09.873
this whole time.

38:13.210 --> 38:14.670
Hey, here.

38:15.254 --> 38:17.548
Hey jp, save your strength.

38:41.029 --> 38:42.573
Just tell me one thing.

38:45.409 --> 38:47.160
You promise to take care
of things.

38:53.500 --> 38:55.043
- Hey, welcome back.

38:58.505 --> 39:00.145
- How long was I out?
- About a half hour.

39:04.136 --> 39:05.721
- Feels like a lifetime.

39:07.890 --> 39:09.224
How's Mr. Mason?

39:09.308 --> 39:11.143
- I don't know, but
if I'd have to guess,

39:11.226 --> 39:13.478
I'd say he's getting a lobotomy
for what he did to you.

39:13.562 --> 39:14.562
- Oh, don't say that.

39:14.605 --> 39:16.481
He probably doesn't
remember that he bit me.

39:16.732 --> 39:19.151
- That, or maybe you
have a forgettable taste.

39:22.571 --> 39:24.364
- I taste a whole lot
better with hot sauce.

39:24.573 --> 39:25.573
- Oh, okay.

39:25.616 --> 39:27.376
Well, maybe next time
I'll slip him a bottle.

39:32.456 --> 39:33.749
- Are you finished?
- Oh, yeah.

39:33.832 --> 39:35.417
I've been done with
this for a while,

39:35.501 --> 39:37.669
but I'd just rather
hang out here with you

39:37.753 --> 39:40.005
than spend time with
James and Cynthia

39:40.088 --> 39:41.673
and the rest of those assholes.

39:42.007 --> 39:43.007
- I get what you mean.

39:43.050 --> 39:44.486
It feels like they
treat the patients

39:44.510 --> 39:47.971
more like cattle
than actual people.

39:48.096 --> 39:49.223
- Exactly, and it's like

39:49.306 --> 39:51.767
that's someone's <i>abuelo </i>or <i>abuela</i>.

39:52.142 --> 39:53.142
- Right.

39:53.519 --> 39:55.562
- Hey, since we're stuck here,

39:55.646 --> 39:58.649
maybe we can teach them
how to treat their own.

39:59.525 --> 40:00.567
- Yeah.

40:01.777 --> 40:02.777
Yeah.

40:04.071 --> 40:05.071
Deal.

40:05.822 --> 40:08.867
- I am tired of
these damn noodles.

40:08.951 --> 40:12.538
Okay? You know, I would kill
for a hamburger right now.

40:12.621 --> 40:15.207
Fernando, I would choke him
out for a burger right now.

40:16.250 --> 40:17.292
Murder somebody.

40:19.211 --> 40:20.629
- Guys, where's Chris?

40:21.880 --> 40:23.423
- Maybe he made his escape.

40:23.507 --> 40:24.550
Busted outta here.

40:24.675 --> 40:26.051
Flew the Coop.

40:26.301 --> 40:28.595
- Wrap it up. Back
to work in five.

40:28.679 --> 40:30.931
- Cynthia, have you seen Chris?

40:31.265 --> 40:33.183
- They sent him back to
the detention center.

40:33.392 --> 40:34.536
What the fuck!

40:34.560 --> 40:36.979
- You try to escape,
that's what happens.

40:41.817 --> 40:42.943
- Look, that's a lie.

40:43.026 --> 40:44.236
- Why?

40:44.903 --> 40:46.738
- 'Cause I found
this in the hallway.

40:47.155 --> 40:49.616
Look, there's no way that
wheezy, half-a-lung dude

40:49.700 --> 40:51.618
would leave without this.

40:51.702 --> 40:52.828
All right?

40:53.579 --> 40:56.456
He may not be eating,
but he using this.

41:26.612 --> 41:29.573
Mr. Phillips, my main man.

41:29.656 --> 41:31.033
You know what time it is?

41:31.116 --> 41:32.409
It's movie time.

41:32.492 --> 41:35.037
Oh yeah, James says you
wasn't feeling too well.

41:35.370 --> 41:37.581
So, I thought a movie
might cheer you up.

41:37.664 --> 41:38.749
Plus...

41:40.584 --> 41:41.627
Got you a date.

41:41.835 --> 41:44.546
Oh yeah, get your little
elderly edition of Netflix

41:44.630 --> 41:46.507
and uh... don't die on me.

41:49.635 --> 41:51.428
Y'all laughing in the inside.

41:51.512 --> 41:53.392
I ain't gonna let y'all
play with me. I'm funny.

41:53.472 --> 41:54.890
I'm go ahead and
hook this TV up.

41:54.973 --> 41:58.852
Is that a DVD, VCR combo?

41:58.936 --> 42:00.896
That's how they
doing you, Mr. Phillips?

42:00.979 --> 42:01.980
All right.

42:02.064 --> 42:03.649
We gonna figure this out.

42:04.525 --> 42:07.361
This is a relic, but...

42:08.862 --> 42:10.906
Let big Mac go to work.

42:14.409 --> 42:16.245
This is crazy.

42:16.703 --> 42:19.206
I don't even know
where to begin.

42:19.289 --> 42:21.166
You got one of them fat backs.

42:21.250 --> 42:23.585
Oh my, what type
of setup is this?

42:23.710 --> 42:24.837
I don't even...

42:26.505 --> 42:28.006
It's all right.

42:28.090 --> 42:29.090
It's all right.

42:37.975 --> 42:40.256
I'm a figure this out, Mr. Phillips.
Don't worry about it.

42:40.435 --> 42:42.104
You know, I'll talk to James.

42:42.479 --> 42:44.106
Gotta get you a new one...

42:48.610 --> 42:50.153
Mr. Phillips?

42:50.445 --> 42:51.446
You okay?

42:59.037 --> 43:00.038
Mr. Phillips.

43:23.270 --> 43:24.897
Mr. Phillips' not breathing.

43:25.355 --> 43:27.191
Did you see anything
what happened?

43:39.912 --> 43:40.912
No.

44:18.575 --> 44:19.575
Chill!

44:20.577 --> 44:21.703
Chill! Chill!

44:46.395 --> 44:47.395
- All right.

44:47.437 --> 44:49.314
I know you all must
have some questions,

44:49.398 --> 44:51.775
but I gotta be
honest with you guys.

44:51.859 --> 44:53.002
I don't pretend to understand

44:53.026 --> 44:54.820
what happened to Mr. Phillips,

44:56.530 --> 44:57.530
yet.

44:58.907 --> 45:03.412
The way he died is shocking
and frankly incomprehensible.

45:03.495 --> 45:04.371
- Uh-uh, it ain't right.

45:04.454 --> 45:07.124
Dude last night was inside
out and upside down.

45:07.624 --> 45:09.126
- What?
- Yes.

45:09.585 --> 45:11.503
- The origin appears to be...

45:11.670 --> 45:13.714
- Seriously, it's the most
disturbing thing

45:13.797 --> 45:14.923
I've ever seen in my life.

45:15.007 --> 45:17.318
- We're conducting a thorough investigation
into his care, and I expect...

45:17.342 --> 45:20.095
- Man, you know where I grew up.
- I've seen some disturbing shit.

45:20.179 --> 45:21.722
- Big Mac.
- Hm?

45:21.805 --> 45:22.931
- Care to chime in?

45:23.056 --> 45:25.142
- No, no. Um...

45:26.226 --> 45:31.148
I was just saying, man,
poor, poor, Mr. Phillips.

45:31.231 --> 45:32.065
I feel bad for him.

45:32.149 --> 45:33.984
That was my guy, man.

45:34.818 --> 45:35.903
- Yeah.

45:36.278 --> 45:37.321
It's unfortunate.

45:37.404 --> 45:38.280
- Oh, Mr. Phillips.

45:38.363 --> 45:42.910
- I'll be here if anyone
needs any help processing.

45:43.493 --> 45:44.493
Okay?

45:48.248 --> 45:51.710
Jp, can I borrow
you for a moment?

45:57.341 --> 46:00.344
Meet Virgil, not that
his name really matters.

46:01.136 --> 46:02.012
- Why is that?

46:02.095 --> 46:03.972
- He's a barn owl,
no more, no less.

46:04.056 --> 46:05.376
He never asks
himself, "who am I?"

46:05.432 --> 46:07.184
But rather, "what's my job?"

46:11.438 --> 46:12.564
Look over there.

46:16.443 --> 46:18.278
Tyrannus melancholicus.

46:23.909 --> 46:25.327
Charming little species.

46:26.036 --> 46:29.790
The only problem is, it's
not native to the region.

46:30.207 --> 46:32.042
It's taking the jobs
of the birds who are

46:32.125 --> 46:34.461
by eating the crickets and
leaving less to go around.

46:37.339 --> 46:40.676
Virgil's job, aside from
eating and one day being eaten,

46:40.843 --> 46:42.302
is to maintain order.

46:43.136 --> 46:44.596
But he can't do it alone.

46:45.430 --> 46:49.059
He does his part, trusting
that those just like him

46:49.226 --> 46:50.269
are doing the same.

46:53.105 --> 46:55.440
Let's say he's the
gatekeeper of alcove

46:55.524 --> 46:58.652
both inside the facility
and out.

47:01.905 --> 47:05.784
But unlike Virgil, I don't have
eyes in the back of my head.

47:06.869 --> 47:09.162
So I have to trust that the
two of you are doing your jobs

47:09.246 --> 47:10.873
and not letting anything,

47:11.290 --> 47:13.208
a stupid fight, to pick
a hypothetical example,

47:13.292 --> 47:14.585
get in the way.

47:14.668 --> 47:17.713
My entire business
hangs on this trust.

47:18.422 --> 47:20.591
Am I wise to invest
this trust in you?

47:21.675 --> 47:22.675
- Yeah.
- Yes.

47:22.718 --> 47:23.927
- Great.

47:24.011 --> 47:25.470
I'll let you two hug it out.

47:25.762 --> 47:26.762
- Hug?

47:34.229 --> 47:35.898
- Truce?
- Okay.

47:38.650 --> 47:40.402
- I'm gonna make your
life a living hell.

47:40.694 --> 47:43.322
- Shh, shh, shh.
- Don't kill the vibe.

47:43.697 --> 47:44.990
- What are you doing?

47:45.199 --> 47:46.408
Fuck, man.

47:46.783 --> 47:47.784
Jesus Christ.

47:52.497 --> 47:53.665
<i>Pendejo.</i>

47:55.918 --> 47:57.718
- Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

47:57.753 --> 48:00.339
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

48:03.050 --> 48:04.384
Oh...

48:26.823 --> 48:29.201
♪ It's big Mac and
the haters after me ♪

48:29.284 --> 48:32.955
♪ I only like big chicks
to eat hot calories ♪

48:39.920 --> 48:42.047
You know what, I'm not
even ashamed of this.

48:42.130 --> 48:44.341
I'm a thug. I punch
people in the face.

48:44.925 --> 48:45.925
- No. Yeah, I know.

48:46.218 --> 48:47.403
- You mind just
giving me a minute.

48:47.427 --> 48:48.595
Do you mind just...

48:48.762 --> 48:49.763
Let me get myself.

48:49.847 --> 48:51.265
Hey, hey.

48:51.348 --> 48:53.475
You ain't gon' tell
anybody, right.

48:53.976 --> 48:54.976
- You good.

48:55.018 --> 48:56.018
- You ain't gon'...

48:56.061 --> 48:56.979
Wait, wait, wait.

48:57.062 --> 48:58.522
That don't sound too believable.

48:58.605 --> 48:59.605
That don't sound too...

49:10.284 --> 49:12.035
- Pool party. What do you say?

49:12.119 --> 49:13.263
- Almost done with curfew check.

49:13.287 --> 49:14.287
- Get in!

49:15.205 --> 49:17.124
Ooh, thanks.

49:17.457 --> 49:18.458
- No problem.

49:20.335 --> 49:24.173
- Gotta say, did not peg you
as a trouble-making type.

49:24.256 --> 49:26.341
- Mm-mm.
- Troublemakers get caught.

49:26.967 --> 49:28.719
- So you're just a bad boy?

49:30.095 --> 49:31.847
For who, I wonder.

49:35.100 --> 49:36.101
Turn around.

49:37.811 --> 49:40.731
Hey, if she were into girls,
I'd try to hit that too.

49:41.106 --> 49:42.441
- Oh, yeah?

49:42.733 --> 49:45.861
- Then again, maybe I could
change your mind about that.

49:47.571 --> 49:50.324
Relax, bro. I'm not
gonna stand in your way.

49:59.666 --> 50:01.251
- Jp, what are you doing here?

50:01.877 --> 50:03.170
It's way past curfew.

50:05.214 --> 50:07.758
Care for a swim?

50:08.300 --> 50:09.593
- She called you a what?

50:09.676 --> 50:10.677
- A six.

50:10.761 --> 50:12.596
- Wow.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

50:12.679 --> 50:14.806
She's clearly tripping.

50:15.432 --> 50:16.432
- Thank you.

50:16.558 --> 50:17.684
- You're a four at best.

50:18.185 --> 50:19.228
- Come on.

50:19.311 --> 50:20.979
- At best.
- Seriously?

50:21.063 --> 50:23.357
- At best.
- Oh, wow. Come on.

50:45.128 --> 50:46.213
What's that?

50:46.713 --> 50:49.758
I mean, you never heard of it?

50:51.134 --> 50:52.302
- What does it mean?

50:52.386 --> 50:53.637
- No, it's not...

50:54.930 --> 50:57.182
It's like when all of
your senses come together

50:57.266 --> 50:58.392
in a perfect way.

50:59.309 --> 51:00.477
Hey, look, I'll show you.

51:01.603 --> 51:02.896
Close your eyes.

51:03.981 --> 51:04.981
Close 'em.

51:09.444 --> 51:10.821
How does that smell?

51:12.072 --> 51:13.282
- Like Brandy.

51:13.365 --> 51:15.242
- No. Come on, try harder.

51:19.037 --> 51:20.038
- Fruits.

51:22.082 --> 51:23.375
Cherries.

51:23.584 --> 51:25.252
- Yeah, very good.

51:31.091 --> 51:32.509
How does that feel?

51:35.929 --> 51:36.930
- Smooth.

51:41.226 --> 51:42.936
- How does that sound?

51:44.605 --> 51:45.606
- Sounds soft.

51:47.274 --> 51:48.274
Very soft.

51:50.611 --> 51:51.862
- Open your eyes.

51:54.489 --> 51:55.657
How do I look?

51:58.243 --> 51:59.244
- Beautiful.

52:00.954 --> 52:03.999
Well, there's only
one sense left, jp.

52:08.128 --> 52:09.128
- Taste.

52:24.770 --> 52:25.771
<i>Si.</i>

52:34.029 --> 52:35.614
So, are we gonna do this?

52:40.661 --> 52:41.661
- Oh, yeah.

52:41.745 --> 52:43.789
I mean, that is if you want to.

52:47.501 --> 52:48.877
- Uh, yeah.

52:50.128 --> 52:51.296
Very, very much.

53:44.808 --> 53:45.808
Fuck!

53:46.768 --> 53:47.768
Jeez!

53:48.478 --> 53:49.646
- Ms. Wilcox.

53:49.730 --> 53:51.648
What are you doing in here?

53:51.732 --> 53:53.150
Come here, let me help you.

53:54.026 --> 53:55.026
Gotcha.

53:55.861 --> 53:58.197
You're not supposed
to leave your room.

53:58.739 --> 54:01.575
I was so scared when I went in
there and you weren't there.

54:04.369 --> 54:05.746
I'll get you back.

54:14.588 --> 54:16.840
- You smashed Micah
last night, didn't you?

54:16.924 --> 54:19.134
Didn't you? Didn't you?

54:19.218 --> 54:20.135
You did.

54:20.219 --> 54:21.303
- That's right.

54:21.386 --> 54:22.554
- Okay. Respect.

54:23.096 --> 54:24.223
Respect. Respect.

54:24.306 --> 54:26.141
Did not know you had
that type of game, baby.

54:26.266 --> 54:28.185
- Hey, now you know.
- Okay. I know.

54:28.268 --> 54:30.388
I know. Now, tell me this.
Tell me this. Tell me this.

54:31.021 --> 54:32.564
How much of a freak was she?

54:32.648 --> 54:33.899
How much was a...

54:36.276 --> 54:37.504
I'm gonna tell
like three people,

54:37.528 --> 54:38.403
but I ain't gonna
tell nobody else.

54:38.487 --> 54:40.048
- All right, I'll tell 'em
about that face mask though.

54:40.072 --> 54:40.906
- Okay.

54:40.989 --> 54:42.157
Okay. All right.

54:43.492 --> 54:44.743
That's our secret to the death.

54:44.826 --> 54:46.078
To the death.

54:46.161 --> 54:48.080
She nasty. I like that.

54:48.163 --> 54:49.915
I'm gonna need to know
more detail though.

54:49.998 --> 54:51.083
I tell you that.

54:51.375 --> 54:52.584
What's up?

54:53.210 --> 54:54.210
- Give me a sec.

55:09.309 --> 55:10.394
Hey, Greta.

55:11.270 --> 55:12.312
Hi.

55:13.939 --> 55:18.026
It's gonna sound weird, but
did anyone give this to you?

55:21.321 --> 55:22.322
Yeah, no?

55:29.204 --> 55:30.664
See, my sister, she used to make

55:30.747 --> 55:33.125
the exact same cootie
catchers back at home.

55:35.711 --> 55:37.129
Her name was Lily.

55:38.380 --> 55:39.380
Do you know her?

55:50.267 --> 55:51.268
Okay.

55:57.274 --> 55:58.275
- Let go of him.

55:58.358 --> 55:59.358
Let go!

55:59.776 --> 56:00.776
- Let go.

56:02.154 --> 56:03.739
- Let's transfer her to ward b.

56:04.114 --> 56:05.324
Been a long time coming.

56:10.537 --> 56:12.706
- Hey, what's wrong?
- What happened?

56:12.789 --> 56:14.082
- No, I'm fine. I just...

56:15.334 --> 56:17.014
I think there's something
wrong with Greta.

56:17.044 --> 56:19.213
- Well, clearly there is, or
else she wouldn't be here.

56:19.296 --> 56:20.631
Don't take it too personally.

56:21.089 --> 56:23.008
- I don't know why she
keeps freaking out on me.

56:24.092 --> 56:25.093
- All right.

56:25.511 --> 56:26.512
It's official.

56:26.595 --> 56:28.013
These people are fucked up!

56:28.347 --> 56:29.973
But you know what's
really fucked up?

56:30.057 --> 56:31.350
Last night was crazy.

56:31.433 --> 56:32.434
I totally blacked out.

56:33.268 --> 56:34.603
- It makes two of us.

56:35.062 --> 56:37.814
After the pool, I don't
remember anything.

56:38.273 --> 56:40.776
And on top of that,
I'm dying out here.

56:42.236 --> 56:43.237
- Wait a second.

56:43.820 --> 56:44.905
- Back off, creep.

56:44.988 --> 56:45.864
- No, just look.

56:45.948 --> 56:47.300
You got a weird Mark on
the back of your neck.

56:47.324 --> 56:49.535
Just look.

56:50.661 --> 56:53.330
- Oh. Oh, that look
like a terrible hickey.

56:53.789 --> 56:55.165
- Yeah.
- Might be those needles

56:55.249 --> 56:56.583
that they're always using.

56:58.335 --> 57:00.337
- Wait, do you
remember being sedated?

57:00.462 --> 57:03.382
- Isn't the point of being
sedated that you don't remember?

57:06.051 --> 57:07.970
There's some strange shit
going on around here.

57:48.760 --> 57:50.345
- That's not how I
would describe it.

57:50.429 --> 57:51.948
- All right. Well then,
how would you describe it?

57:51.972 --> 57:53.891
- It's not a scam
if you're getting paid.

57:53.974 --> 57:55.976
- Cynthia, you're
paid to get into it.

57:56.059 --> 57:57.704
- You think you're so
much smarter than me.

57:57.728 --> 58:00.230
You have to start somewhere.
Right now I'm just at the bottom.

58:00.314 --> 58:02.232
Of the pyramid...

58:36.600 --> 58:37.893
- You're sure about this?

58:38.977 --> 58:41.021
- We can't have her
freaking out all the time.

58:41.104 --> 58:43.774
Let's just double her dosage
and make our lives easier.

58:44.942 --> 58:45.943
- All right.

58:49.196 --> 58:50.196
Let's go.

58:50.864 --> 58:52.407
- I can't wait till she's gone.

58:52.699 --> 58:54.243
Just a matter of
days at this point.

58:56.078 --> 58:57.078
What?

58:57.704 --> 58:58.747
- Did you hear that?

59:05.128 --> 59:06.713
- No, it's probably nothing.

59:06.797 --> 59:07.840
- I dunno.

59:07.923 --> 59:09.716
- Come on. I hate this job.

59:34.533 --> 59:36.451
- You will die here.

59:37.661 --> 59:39.955
You will die here.

59:41.123 --> 59:42.749
- Holy fuck! Oh, shit.

59:53.051 --> 59:55.095
- Have y'all seen jp?

59:55.179 --> 59:57.389
- Cynthia told me he's been
on kitchen duty all morning.

59:57.472 --> 59:59.933
- No, that was me.

1:00:00.350 --> 1:00:01.518
Why do you think your lunch

1:00:01.602 --> 1:00:03.437
is so irresistibly
delicious, huh?

1:00:04.813 --> 1:00:06.565
- Your hands are blessed.

1:00:07.316 --> 1:00:08.901
- Anointed.
- What can I say?

1:00:08.984 --> 1:00:10.444
I'm talented.

1:00:10.527 --> 1:00:11.778
Jp missin' out.

1:00:13.030 --> 1:00:13.906
- Wait.

1:00:13.989 --> 1:00:17.075
Well, we know they're lying
to us about Chris, right?

1:00:17.784 --> 1:00:18.784
What about jp?

1:00:21.705 --> 1:00:23.123
- You know what? I got a idea.

1:00:32.925 --> 1:00:34.593
- All right, Camilla.
- You stay guard.

1:00:34.676 --> 1:00:35.862
- Why do I have
to stay on guard?

1:00:35.886 --> 1:00:37.326
- I'll freak out if
anybody shows up.

1:00:37.471 --> 1:00:39.097
Plus, you think
better on your feet.

1:00:39.181 --> 1:00:40.516
- That's blatant flattery.

1:00:41.683 --> 1:00:43.560
But okay, I'll bite.

1:00:44.019 --> 1:00:46.313
- If you see anyone coming,
just give us a sign.

1:00:46.396 --> 1:00:47.606
- What kinda sign?

1:00:47.689 --> 1:00:48.774
- A bird call.

1:00:48.857 --> 1:00:49.900
- A bird call, really?

1:00:50.859 --> 1:00:52.653
- Yes, like ca caw, ca caw.

1:00:52.778 --> 1:00:55.072
- Come on, I can't even think
of anything more obvious.

1:00:55.155 --> 1:00:56.490
- That's not obvious.

1:00:56.615 --> 1:00:57.866
- Do you see birds?

1:00:57.950 --> 1:00:59.802
- There's a lot of birds.
- Guys, when he comes out,

1:00:59.826 --> 1:01:00.826
just fucking go.

1:01:12.422 --> 1:01:13.422
Go!

1:01:14.216 --> 1:01:15.443
- Ca caw, ca caw, that's it.
- No.

1:01:15.467 --> 1:01:16.467
- Yes, it is.

1:01:18.053 --> 1:01:19.054
- Damn.

1:01:20.013 --> 1:01:22.015
Okay, what are we
even looking for?

1:01:22.099 --> 1:01:24.226
- Anything with
Chris or jp's name?

1:01:27.396 --> 1:01:28.396
This is nice.

1:01:33.694 --> 1:01:35.696
- Okay. I guess
I'll look over here.

1:01:35.779 --> 1:01:37.614
- This middle drawer's locked.

1:01:39.366 --> 1:01:42.786
There's gotta be
a key somewhere.

1:01:43.120 --> 1:01:45.289
- You know, maybe we
should just get outta here.

1:01:45.372 --> 1:01:48.333
- Ah, I found one.

1:01:49.501 --> 1:01:50.627
- That is not a key.

1:01:50.752 --> 1:01:51.837
- But it is.

1:01:51.920 --> 1:01:53.422
And no, I don't
know how to do this

1:01:53.505 --> 1:01:54.715
just because I'm black.

1:01:54.798 --> 1:01:56.800
My father was a locksmith.

1:01:56.884 --> 1:01:59.219
- Thank you so much
for that clarification.

1:01:59.428 --> 1:02:00.428
- Yeah.

1:02:00.929 --> 1:02:02.598
I can hear you judging me.

1:02:05.475 --> 1:02:06.852
Give me a second.

1:02:07.895 --> 1:02:09.771
A little rusty, but...

1:02:15.027 --> 1:02:16.027
Got it.

1:02:18.739 --> 1:02:19.740
Oh, yeah.

1:02:20.657 --> 1:02:21.742
What is this?

1:02:23.076 --> 1:02:24.161
- What is that?

1:02:24.369 --> 1:02:26.914
- It looks like a machine
or something like that.

1:02:27.039 --> 1:02:28.039
Oh.

1:02:34.129 --> 1:02:35.129
- Fuck!

1:02:38.133 --> 1:02:39.593
Hey, James.

1:02:39.676 --> 1:02:41.678
Just who I wanted
to see actually.

1:02:41.762 --> 1:02:42.888
- What is it?

1:02:45.933 --> 1:02:47.559
- Here's Chris.
- Wait, look.

1:02:47.643 --> 1:02:49.186
- Solitary?

1:02:49.269 --> 1:02:51.021
- The fuck!
- James, so do you like...

1:02:51.104 --> 1:02:52.856
- What happened to the ca caw?

1:02:52.940 --> 1:02:53.982
- Okay, we gotta go.

1:02:54.107 --> 1:02:55.400
- He hasn't been eating.

1:02:55.484 --> 1:02:56.961
Just go spoonfeed him
some tuna or something.

1:02:56.985 --> 1:02:58.028
- Dude, I just wanna know-

1:02:58.111 --> 1:03:00.697
- Camilla, be quiet and go, now.

1:03:20.467 --> 1:03:22.553
What do we have here?

1:03:27.307 --> 1:03:28.892
All right.

1:03:36.441 --> 1:03:40.904
So James, what's it like to
run a summer camp for wetbacks?

1:03:41.154 --> 1:03:42.489
Oh yeah, it's great.

1:03:42.573 --> 1:03:44.199
Everything I ever wanted.

1:03:45.617 --> 1:03:47.286
Fuck this place, man.

1:03:59.339 --> 1:04:00.966
- That dude is crazy.

1:04:01.049 --> 1:04:02.968
- I don't know. Let's
just get outta here.

1:04:04.261 --> 1:04:06.471
Oh, shit!

1:04:06.847 --> 1:04:07.681
Fuck!

1:04:19.443 --> 1:04:20.777
- Oh my god!

1:04:30.996 --> 1:04:32.581
- Hey, where are we?

1:04:33.123 --> 1:04:34.249
What's going on?

1:04:39.796 --> 1:04:42.299
Jesus Christ, what the
hell happened to you guys?

1:04:43.550 --> 1:04:44.635
- What'd you guys find out?

1:04:44.718 --> 1:04:45.886
- I found some crazy shit.

1:04:45.969 --> 1:04:47.489
- Oh, these fuckers are up
to something, aren't they?

1:04:48.889 --> 1:04:51.475
- But I'm calling it,
freemasons.

1:04:51.558 --> 1:04:52.643
No, no, no, no.

1:04:52.726 --> 1:04:53.977
Lizard, no.

1:04:54.269 --> 1:04:55.812
No! The illuminati!

1:04:55.896 --> 1:04:57.749
- Stop talking like Chris
and tell me what happened.

1:04:57.773 --> 1:04:59.209
- Matter of fact, actually,
poor Chris-

1:04:59.233 --> 1:05:00.233
- hey, Mac.

1:05:03.904 --> 1:05:05.197
Help me out with something.

1:05:06.949 --> 1:05:08.325
- No problem.

1:05:08.575 --> 1:05:09.575
- Come on.

1:05:17.793 --> 1:05:18.793
- Thank you.

1:05:20.838 --> 1:05:22.756
You hear that?

1:05:23.382 --> 1:05:24.508
It's coming from the vent.

1:05:24.842 --> 1:05:26.260
Screw must be loose.

1:05:26.802 --> 1:05:28.136
Fix it before dinner.

1:05:31.765 --> 1:05:33.559
- Fix it before dinner.

1:05:34.601 --> 1:05:36.103
I'm onto you, James.

1:05:36.854 --> 1:05:37.896
I'm onto you.

1:05:43.777 --> 1:05:45.362
Crap!

1:05:46.029 --> 1:05:47.948
It's cool. I got it.

1:05:51.201 --> 1:05:52.971
- Guess he think the Mac
man can do everything.

1:05:52.995 --> 1:05:54.635
You know what? I can
do everything, James.

1:05:54.705 --> 1:05:55.956
I'm built for this.

1:06:00.127 --> 1:06:01.044
- Oh, shit!

1:06:01.128 --> 1:06:02.212
Where'd he go?

1:06:02.629 --> 1:06:06.008
- Got all this money round here,
ain't got no maintenance man?

1:06:16.560 --> 1:06:18.562
- Big Mac.
- Get back. Everyone.

1:06:18.645 --> 1:06:19.938
- Somebody call an ambulance.

1:06:20.856 --> 1:06:22.357
- Nobody's calling anyone.

1:06:22.482 --> 1:06:23.650
Now, get back.

1:06:24.735 --> 1:06:25.986
We will handle this.

1:06:41.168 --> 1:06:42.252
- James, you there?

1:06:43.378 --> 1:06:45.088
We need some help
down here right away.

1:06:48.509 --> 1:06:50.093
- Sending someone right away.

1:06:50.594 --> 1:06:52.429
You, go find Bruce.

1:07:48.569 --> 1:07:50.529
- Looks like those
commercials are working.

1:07:50.821 --> 1:07:52.072
Product's selling well.

1:07:52.573 --> 1:07:53.866
- Keep your voice down.

1:07:55.826 --> 1:07:57.202
- You ever tried one?

1:07:57.369 --> 1:07:58.412
- Have I?

1:07:58.745 --> 1:08:00.789
Are you out of your goddam mind?

1:08:02.457 --> 1:08:03.375
Eddie, don't tell me you-

1:08:03.458 --> 1:08:04.626
- no!

1:08:05.043 --> 1:08:06.170
But the kids have.

1:08:06.587 --> 1:08:07.754
- They tell the difference?

1:08:08.088 --> 1:08:10.174
- Apparently, they taste
just like the real thing.

1:08:11.592 --> 1:08:14.261
Steak, meatballs,
chilli dogs, sloppy Joes.

1:08:14.678 --> 1:08:16.763
Tacos.

1:08:43.081 --> 1:08:45.292
- Open the door. Quick, quick.

1:08:50.421 --> 1:08:52.131
Three, two, one.

1:08:54.760 --> 1:08:55.801
Go back to the lab.

1:08:55.886 --> 1:08:56.886
We'll deal with him now.

1:09:00.682 --> 1:09:01.934
- He's not responding.

1:09:04.394 --> 1:09:06.479
- Shit! Eddie's gonna kill us.

1:09:07.981 --> 1:09:09.107
- What do we do?

1:09:09.233 --> 1:09:10.692
- There's only one thing to do.

1:09:10.817 --> 1:09:13.737
We're gonna jumpstart his system
and inject him with adrenaline.

1:09:14.321 --> 1:09:15.531
- No, no, no.

1:09:15.697 --> 1:09:17.198
We'll just wake him up.

1:10:01.702 --> 1:10:03.704
- He's the gatekeeper of alcove

1:10:03.787 --> 1:10:06.498
both inside and
outside the facility.

1:10:07.124 --> 1:10:10.002
- Virgil will set you free.

1:10:22.347 --> 1:10:23.347
- Fuck!

1:10:38.780 --> 1:10:39.698
- Jp's gone.

1:10:39.781 --> 1:10:41.950
I repeat, I cannot find jp.

1:10:59.885 --> 1:11:01.220
- Talk to me about production.

1:11:01.303 --> 1:11:02.763
- Well, the supply
of raw materials

1:11:02.846 --> 1:11:04.348
is going better than expected.

1:11:04.973 --> 1:11:06.159
We'll never run
out at this rate.

1:11:06.183 --> 1:11:07.267
- And the kids?

1:11:08.393 --> 1:11:09.728
Any discipline issues?

1:11:10.145 --> 1:11:11.396
- Nothing to worry about.

1:11:12.856 --> 1:11:14.650
The sedatives keep
the kids in check.

1:11:14.983 --> 1:11:17.110
We also lace 'em with
highly effective hormones,

1:11:17.194 --> 1:11:19.363
tenderizing their
bodies by more than 20%.

1:11:19.947 --> 1:11:21.448
- So how's it working?

1:11:22.115 --> 1:11:23.283
The machine.

1:11:25.786 --> 1:11:27.871
- The prototype produces
twice the number of patties

1:11:27.955 --> 1:11:29.641
in half the time of your
average assembly line.

1:11:29.665 --> 1:11:31.875
We have more product than
we know what to do with.

1:11:32.626 --> 1:11:33.645
- And the results are the same

1:11:33.669 --> 1:11:35.212
across all 12 of our facilities.

1:11:38.966 --> 1:11:41.093
We have a commercially
reliable product

1:11:41.176 --> 1:11:44.012
that's safe to eat, tastes
just like the real thing.

1:11:44.888 --> 1:11:47.266
And best of all,
all production costs

1:11:47.349 --> 1:11:49.518
are covered by John q taxpayer.

1:11:49.601 --> 1:11:50.519
- Hm!

1:11:50.602 --> 1:11:51.602
Damn!

1:12:00.946 --> 1:12:01.946
- Jp.

1:12:02.906 --> 1:12:03.907
What's going on?

1:12:03.991 --> 1:12:04.908
What are you doing?

1:12:04.992 --> 1:12:05.992
- Micah.

1:12:07.202 --> 1:12:08.620
They did this to me.

1:12:09.371 --> 1:12:11.999
We gotta run before
they do it to everyone.

1:12:12.082 --> 1:12:13.082
- My god.

1:12:14.793 --> 1:12:16.086
What happened to you?

1:12:17.171 --> 1:12:18.505
- Don't get any fucking closer.

1:12:23.677 --> 1:12:24.803
- Sorry, dude.

1:12:31.059 --> 1:12:33.562
For the record,
we never happened.

1:12:33.812 --> 1:12:35.522
I don't fuck the help.

1:12:48.785 --> 1:12:49.995
- Don't be afraid.

1:12:50.746 --> 1:12:53.248
Fear releases adrenaline,
stiffens the muscles.

1:12:54.082 --> 1:12:55.250
Spoils the meat.

1:12:56.460 --> 1:12:58.253
- You're a fucking cannibal.

1:12:58.337 --> 1:12:59.963
- Oh, come on.
- I don't eat the burgers.

1:13:00.797 --> 1:13:01.882
- Fuck you.

1:13:05.761 --> 1:13:07.679
- I'm not a cannibal, jp.

1:13:09.598 --> 1:13:10.849
I'm an American.

1:13:11.183 --> 1:13:13.060
Something you'll
never really be.

1:13:13.685 --> 1:13:15.771
People like you cry supremacy.

1:13:16.396 --> 1:13:18.690
I call it manifest destiny.

1:13:19.024 --> 1:13:20.484
One nation, all our own.

1:13:22.861 --> 1:13:24.696
How's my little spy
doing tonight?

1:13:31.370 --> 1:13:32.412
- Hungry.

1:13:34.289 --> 1:13:37.668
- You know, jp, we used
to need people like you.

1:13:38.460 --> 1:13:42.256
To pick our crops, sew our
clothes, build our cities,

1:13:42.339 --> 1:13:46.260
and yes, wipe the
asses of our elders.

1:13:46.468 --> 1:13:48.679
And boy, did you all deliver.

1:13:49.638 --> 1:13:52.224
I mean, how else do you
explain the world we live in?

1:13:52.349 --> 1:13:53.767
Where you can buy
virtually anything

1:13:53.851 --> 1:13:55.936
from anyone, anywhere
and have it delivered

1:13:56.019 --> 1:13:57.896
to your doorstep
before breakfast.

1:13:58.355 --> 1:14:00.357
That doesn't just happen, jp.

1:14:00.816 --> 1:14:01.817
It's by design.

1:14:05.737 --> 1:14:06.780
Ask your lawyer.

1:14:09.658 --> 1:14:10.659
She knows.

1:14:11.577 --> 1:14:13.787
It's all thanks to
people like you.

1:14:16.540 --> 1:14:20.669
Doing jobs that nobody
wants for basically nothing.

1:14:22.754 --> 1:14:23.964
And for that...

1:14:25.924 --> 1:14:27.593
I say <i>gracias.</i>

1:14:30.929 --> 1:14:32.848
But look to the future, jp.

1:14:35.601 --> 1:14:37.186
This is progress.

1:14:37.644 --> 1:14:38.770
Automation.

1:14:39.980 --> 1:14:42.024
We don't need your
cheap labor anymore.

1:14:42.399 --> 1:14:43.942
You're obsolete.

1:14:44.026 --> 1:14:45.861
And frankly, you've
been consuming

1:14:45.944 --> 1:14:47.547
more than you've been
contributing lately.

1:14:47.571 --> 1:14:50.490
So for the good of my
people, you'll now supply

1:14:50.616 --> 1:14:52.659
the only thing you have left
to offer.

1:15:20.103 --> 1:15:21.772
Ca caw! Ca caw!

1:15:24.900 --> 1:15:26.318
- If you try to escape,

1:15:26.401 --> 1:15:28.946
you'll be sent back to
the detention center.

1:15:29.696 --> 1:15:30.989
- Do not test us.

1:15:31.073 --> 1:15:32.699
We have eyes in the
back of our heads.

1:15:32.783 --> 1:15:34.910
Curfew is mandatory
and non-negotiable.

1:15:36.745 --> 1:15:39.706
- Relaxation's a big thing here,
so no matter what happens...

1:17:00.871 --> 1:17:03.081
- Don't apologize
for your privilege.

1:17:04.625 --> 1:17:06.001
That's what Eddie says.

1:17:08.462 --> 1:17:10.297
You know, I used
to fear my power.

1:17:11.173 --> 1:17:12.299
I know you won't believe it.

1:17:12.382 --> 1:17:15.552
But I used to feel like
I didn't deserve it.

1:17:17.137 --> 1:17:18.597
Until I met Eddie.

1:17:19.806 --> 1:17:20.806
- Lily.

1:17:22.351 --> 1:17:24.144
What did you do to my sister?

1:17:32.694 --> 1:17:33.694
- She's alive.

1:17:35.405 --> 1:17:36.740
Not for long.

1:17:38.075 --> 1:17:40.702
Started drugging her
the moment she got here.

1:17:41.662 --> 1:17:42.829
Promise you.

1:17:43.247 --> 1:17:45.958
Anti-anxiety meds
dissolved in the water.

1:17:46.333 --> 1:17:47.626
Chris was right about that.

1:17:48.043 --> 1:17:54.508
Triggering night terrors, paranoia,
violent hallucinations.

1:17:55.467 --> 1:17:57.427
That one's my favorite.

1:17:59.680 --> 1:18:02.140
Next, we add hormone to the mix.

1:18:02.432 --> 1:18:07.271
Converting lean muscle
to tender meat.

1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:11.275
That's hard work on your body.

1:18:12.025 --> 1:18:15.904
Your bones weaken,
dementia sits in,

1:18:17.364 --> 1:18:23.328
as you become slow,
confused, disoriented.

1:18:24.454 --> 1:18:25.789
The perfect livestock.

1:18:29.001 --> 1:18:31.628
All the while,
your season salted

1:18:31.753 --> 1:18:35.966
and tenderized to perfection.

1:18:37.050 --> 1:18:41.180
Extreme aging wasn't an expected
by-product of the hormones,

1:18:41.346 --> 1:18:45.142
but fuck, it turned out
to be the perfect cover,

1:18:45.225 --> 1:18:49.396
because no one wants to
look at old folks too close.

1:18:49.688 --> 1:18:51.064
Age is disgusting.

1:18:51.607 --> 1:18:57.070
Stick grandma in a home and
forget about her, right?

1:18:57.905 --> 1:19:02.159
And no, you won't die peacefully
in bed from natural causes

1:19:02.242 --> 1:19:06.622
because buried deep within
our genes is like this reflex.

1:19:07.831 --> 1:19:09.875
A final gasp of rebellion

1:19:10.459 --> 1:19:13.045
where your body
just destroys itself

1:19:13.128 --> 1:19:15.130
and everything else in its way.

1:19:16.131 --> 1:19:19.635
A surge of violence before
your body shuts down

1:19:19.801 --> 1:19:23.055
to let us know that your
body's ready for the process.

1:19:31.855 --> 1:19:34.358
There's a natural
order to this world,

1:19:35.400 --> 1:19:37.861
and we're just
here to enforce it.

1:19:39.821 --> 1:19:41.031
- Here at lady Liberty's,

1:19:41.114 --> 1:19:42.491
we like to keep things simple.

1:19:42.908 --> 1:19:44.660
We serve the best
tasting burgers

1:19:44.743 --> 1:19:46.787
at the lowest prices, period.

1:19:46.912 --> 1:19:48.830
Like our baby blues burger.

1:19:48.914 --> 1:19:51.083
Available now from 5.99.

1:19:51.250 --> 1:19:53.627
Made for our people
by our people.

1:19:53.836 --> 1:19:56.755
The same low price
as the big fancy chains.

1:19:57.965 --> 1:19:59.049
- Psst! Hey.

1:19:59.758 --> 1:20:00.801
Camilla.

1:20:01.051 --> 1:20:02.094
- Oh, shit.

1:20:02.761 --> 1:20:05.055
- Not now. You don't look
too good yourself, okay?

1:20:05.305 --> 1:20:07.516
- I remember the small
town I grew up in.

1:20:13.146 --> 1:20:14.146
- Where's big Mac?

1:20:14.356 --> 1:20:15.356
- No one knows.

1:20:15.941 --> 1:20:17.901
I just know he
tried to escape too.

1:20:19.111 --> 1:20:21.029
- We gotta get outta here.
- I mean...

1:20:21.113 --> 1:20:22.573
There's not much time.

1:20:23.824 --> 1:20:25.117
- Till what?

1:20:25.242 --> 1:20:27.202
- Until they come
in here, take you,

1:20:27.286 --> 1:20:29.872
take me and churn
us into some...

1:20:34.668 --> 1:20:38.255
- Family, duty, self-reliance,

1:20:39.381 --> 1:20:40.381
hard work.

1:20:42.718 --> 1:20:44.595
So long as I am your governor...

1:20:46.263 --> 1:20:47.472
- After dinner.

1:20:49.433 --> 1:20:51.143
That's when we make our move.

1:20:53.896 --> 1:20:55.522
I'm Harper Percy Finn.

1:20:55.814 --> 1:20:59.151
And I'm asking you,
remember who we are.

1:20:59.735 --> 1:21:01.195
- Remember who we are.

1:21:01.278 --> 1:21:02.779
Remember who we are.

1:21:02.905 --> 1:21:04.865
Remember who we are...

1:21:24.968 --> 1:21:25.968
- Hello?

1:21:27.596 --> 1:21:28.596
Hi.

1:21:30.891 --> 1:21:31.975
Lily.

1:21:38.232 --> 1:21:40.859
It's me. It's jp.

1:21:43.820 --> 1:21:44.821
Your brother.

1:21:46.198 --> 1:21:47.282
You remember?

1:21:47.866 --> 1:21:49.117
You remember mom?

1:21:51.370 --> 1:21:52.412
Amelia?

1:21:53.413 --> 1:21:54.831
Remember the woman
who growled at me

1:21:54.915 --> 1:21:56.083
for throwing water balloons

1:21:56.166 --> 1:21:57.167
at the quinceanera?

1:22:00.671 --> 1:22:01.671
You remember.

1:22:05.509 --> 1:22:06.635
There you are.

1:22:30.284 --> 1:22:31.994
I'm gonna get us out of here.

1:22:34.413 --> 1:22:36.540
I'm a figure it out, I promise.

1:22:50.929 --> 1:22:52.139
- Well, well.

1:22:52.222 --> 1:22:54.141
Looks like someone's
having trouble sleeping.

1:22:54.558 --> 1:22:56.435
- Yeah, I think I
can help with that.

1:23:02.357 --> 1:23:04.151
You little bitch!

1:23:04.234 --> 1:23:05.527
- What the fuck!

1:23:08.822 --> 1:23:09.698
- All right.

1:23:09.781 --> 1:23:11.074
All right, you've had your fun.

1:23:16.914 --> 1:23:18.790
- All right, you old fucks,
back to bed.

1:23:18.999 --> 1:23:20.250
- Last chance.

1:23:20.334 --> 1:23:21.793
- All right, what do we do now?

1:23:36.892 --> 1:23:37.892
- Hey!

1:23:37.935 --> 1:23:38.936
Get back here!

1:23:41.605 --> 1:23:43.190
Son of a bitch!

1:24:25.065 --> 1:24:26.775
- Let go of me.

1:24:31.363 --> 1:24:33.115
- Get the fuck off me!

1:24:49.840 --> 1:24:51.341
- It's crazy down there.

1:24:51.425 --> 1:24:54.428
It's like the elderly
version of 300.

1:24:54.636 --> 1:24:56.388
I been crawling through the vent

1:24:56.471 --> 1:24:58.473
like I'm black Bruce Willis.

1:25:31.798 --> 1:25:32.841
Jp...

1:25:34.092 --> 1:25:35.636
I got pee on my hands.

1:25:37.054 --> 1:25:38.054
Don't tell nobody.

1:25:40.390 --> 1:25:42.643
We gotta go.

1:25:42.726 --> 1:25:43.726
We gotta go.

1:25:47.773 --> 1:25:49.149
Come on. Come on.

1:25:52.194 --> 1:25:53.987
- Hey, big Mac.
- What's up?

1:25:54.530 --> 1:25:56.365
- Thanks, man.
- You're welcome.

1:25:56.865 --> 1:25:57.865
You're welcome.

1:26:38.740 --> 1:26:40.909
- These old people
are savages, man.

1:26:42.494 --> 1:26:43.494
- I got her.

1:27:16.486 --> 1:27:18.405
Where the hell are we going?

1:27:35.672 --> 1:27:37.466
- I'm gonna find
another way out.

1:27:38.425 --> 1:27:39.425
Stay here.

1:27:46.225 --> 1:27:47.851
Can I count on you
to stay with her?

1:27:48.018 --> 1:27:50.020
- I'm an asshole,
jp, not a quitter.

1:27:50.437 --> 1:27:51.437
Go!

1:27:56.151 --> 1:27:57.945
- Ca caw, motherfuckers.

1:27:58.362 --> 1:27:59.905
Let's blow this bitch.

1:28:00.030 --> 1:28:01.156
Let's go!

1:28:52.249 --> 1:28:53.792
Excuse me.

1:28:54.209 --> 1:28:57.421
Um... hey, can I use your
phone real quick?

1:28:59.339 --> 1:29:00.507
Okay, no wow!

1:29:01.008 --> 1:29:03.093
Oh, it's 'cause I'm black?

1:29:04.011 --> 1:29:05.572
Or because I got all
these old people with me.

1:29:05.596 --> 1:29:06.596
Is that right?

1:29:16.857 --> 1:29:18.025
Jp, just...

1:29:18.567 --> 1:29:19.860
- Jp!
- Chris?

1:29:19.943 --> 1:29:22.196
- I tried to warn you guys.

1:29:22.321 --> 1:29:24.781
- Chris, you're alive.

1:29:24.907 --> 1:29:27.075
- Look what they've done to...

1:29:55.771 --> 1:29:57.981
- I gotta say,
I admire you, kid.

1:29:58.690 --> 1:30:00.734
You know, it doesn't
feel that way right now.

1:30:02.653 --> 1:30:04.571
Nobody's ever made
it this far before.

1:30:05.197 --> 1:30:07.574
You should be proud, and
all you had was hope.

1:30:08.033 --> 1:30:10.202
But hope doesn't
change things, jp.

1:30:11.119 --> 1:30:12.329
Power does.

1:30:25.926 --> 1:30:28.303
You step up to take
care of your people,

1:30:28.387 --> 1:30:30.389
just like I take care of mine.

1:30:37.271 --> 1:30:38.897
It's nothing personal, jp.

1:30:41.859 --> 1:30:42.901
Just progress.

1:31:00.335 --> 1:31:01.335
- Come on.

1:31:03.672 --> 1:31:05.090
- Are you good?
- Uh-huh.

1:31:06.049 --> 1:31:07.129
- Let's get you outta here.

1:31:07.384 --> 1:31:08.552
Bitch.

1:31:11.013 --> 1:31:12.013
- No!

1:32:04.525 --> 1:32:06.068
- Hey. Hey, get up.

1:32:06.693 --> 1:32:08.237
Come on. I got you.

1:32:08.862 --> 1:32:09.863
Let's go.

1:33:45.083 --> 1:33:46.210
- Oh, we did it.

1:33:51.590 --> 1:33:52.590
Jp?

1:33:53.300 --> 1:33:54.343
Jp!

1:33:56.803 --> 1:33:57.971
Jp!

1:33:58.055 --> 1:33:59.055
Jp!

1:34:01.308 --> 1:34:03.352
This is a pivotal hour

1:34:03.435 --> 1:34:05.062
in the immigration showdown,

1:34:05.187 --> 1:34:07.731
as researchers
discover how a madman

1:34:07.856 --> 1:34:09.942
has taken advantage
of a broken system

1:34:10.067 --> 1:34:11.735
for his own depraved agenda.

1:34:11.985 --> 1:34:14.238
- Amidst damning evidence,
authorities have shut down.

1:34:14.321 --> 1:34:16.365
Governor Finn's lady
Liberty burger chain.

1:34:16.448 --> 1:34:18.116
Meanwhile, the governor himself

1:34:18.200 --> 1:34:20.410
appears to have
fled the country.

1:34:20.786 --> 1:34:22.287
As researchers
scramble for a way

1:34:22.371 --> 1:34:24.039
to reverse the damage Mr. Davis

1:34:24.122 --> 1:34:25.958
and his co-conspirators
have done,

1:34:26.750 --> 1:34:29.086
the state legislature has
agreed to a suspension

1:34:29.169 --> 1:34:31.588
of the executive order which
set all of this into motion.

1:34:35.926 --> 1:34:38.011
- Allowing for the
immigrants to be reunited

1:34:38.095 --> 1:34:39.471
with their loved ones.

1:34:47.521 --> 1:34:48.522
- Psst!

1:34:53.318 --> 1:34:55.112
- Did you just psst me?

1:34:57.072 --> 1:34:58.532
Oh, y'all playing games.

1:34:59.324 --> 1:35:00.993
That's what we doing right now?

1:35:01.869 --> 1:35:03.245
Oh, you think it's a game?

1:35:03.662 --> 1:35:05.914
Y'all
think this is funny?

1:35:06.206 --> 1:35:08.208
- Oh, no, it's too easy.

1:35:08.333 --> 1:35:10.253
- Y'all playing games with
my emotions right now.

1:35:10.335 --> 1:35:11.795
Y'all see me!

1:35:12.462 --> 1:35:14.464
Fuck the both of
y'all, all right?

1:35:14.548 --> 1:35:15.465
I'm outta here.

1:35:15.549 --> 1:35:17.467
- Hey, hey, hey, hey,
don't be like that.

1:35:17.593 --> 1:35:18.594
- No!
- Come back, Mac.

1:35:18.677 --> 1:35:19.720
Come on. Come back.

1:35:19.803 --> 1:35:20.596
- Come back? Come back.

1:35:20.679 --> 1:35:22.055
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

1:35:22.264 --> 1:35:23.744
- We were taking a nap.
- We were tired.

1:35:23.807 --> 1:35:26.185
- We literally just saw a
guy get turned into a burger.

1:35:26.268 --> 1:35:27.954
- You know what? Come on.
- Come on. Let's go.

1:35:27.978 --> 1:35:29.080
You're lucky
I respect my elders.

1:35:29.104 --> 1:35:30.522
Come on, get your ass up.

1:35:30.898 --> 1:35:31.982
Oh, look at that.

1:35:32.357 --> 1:35:33.567
Arthritis.

1:35:33.859 --> 1:35:35.110
Ain't that a bitch?

1:35:35.235 --> 1:35:36.987
Uh-huh. Come on, old lady.

1:35:37.154 --> 1:35:39.114
