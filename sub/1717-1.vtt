<i>THE OTHER:
The Tesseract has awakened.</i>

00:33.034 --> 00:38.039
It is on a little world, a human world.

00:38.707 --> 00:42.127
They would wield its power,

00:42.419 --> 00:48.133
but our ally knows its
workings as they never will.

00:49.634 --> 00:52.762
<i>He is ready to lead</i>

00:52.929 --> 00:58.393
<i>and our force, our Chitauri, will follow.</i>

01:02.605 --> 01:05.734
<i>The universe, yours.</i>

01:05.900 --> 01:11.531
<i>And the humans,
what can they do but burn?</i>

How bad is it?

02:03.166 --> 02:06.294
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

02:10.048 --> 02:12.967
Dr Selvig read an energy surge
from the Tesseract four hours ago.

02:13.051 --> 02:14.969
NASA didn't authorise Selvig
to go to test phase.

02:15.136 --> 02:17.388
He wasn't testing it.
He wasn't even in the room.

02:17.555 --> 02:18.556
Spontaneous event.

02:18.640 --> 02:19.641
It just turned itself on?

02:20.058 --> 02:21.142
Where are the energy levels now?

02:21.309 --> 02:23.520
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't
shut it down, we ordered evac.

02:23.686 --> 02:24.729
How long to get everyone out?

02:25.104 --> 02:26.481
Campus should be clear
in the next half-hour.

02:26.648 --> 02:27.941
Do better.

02:28.858 --> 02:30.860
HILL: Sir, evacuation may be futile.

02:31.027 --> 02:32.278
FURY: We should tell them
to go back to sleep?

02:32.612 --> 02:34.864
HILL: If we can't control
the Tesseract's energy,

02:35.031 --> 02:37.408
there may not be
a minimum safe distance.

02:37.492 --> 02:38.576
I need you to make sure

02:38.660 --> 02:40.370
the Phase 2 prototypes
are shipped out.

02:40.495 --> 02:42.580
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

02:42.747 --> 02:44.499
Until such time as the world ends,

02:44.582 --> 02:46.459
we will act as though
it intends to spin on.

02:47.585 --> 02:49.003
Clear out the tech below.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.631
Every piece of Phase 2

02:51.714 --> 02:52.841
Yes, sir.

02:53.258 --> 02:54.425

02:57.428 --> 02:58.429
Talk to me, Doctor.

03:00.431 --> 03:01.850
Director.

03:02.016 --> 03:03.726
FURY: ls there anything
we know for certain?

03:03.893 --> 03:06.145
SELVIG: The Tesseract is misbehaving.

03:06.312 --> 03:09.148
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- No, it's not funny at all.

03:09.315 --> 03:12.652
The Tesseract is not only
active, she's behaving.

03:13.069 --> 03:14.112
FURY: I assume you pulled the plug.

03:14.279 --> 03:15.989
SELVIG: She's an energy source.

03:16.322 --> 03:19.367
We turn off the power,
she turns it back on.

03:19.450 --> 03:20.577
If she reaches peak level...

03:20.743 --> 03:24.205
We prepared for this, Doctor.
Harnessing energy from space.

03:24.372 --> 03:25.790
But we don't have the harness.

03:25.874 --> 03:26.958
My calculations are far from complete.

03:27.709 --> 03:30.295
And she's throwing off
interference, radiation.

03:30.461 --> 03:31.921
Nothing harmful,
low levels of gamma radiation.

03:33.089 --> 03:34.674
That can be harmful.

03:35.133 --> 03:36.593

03:48.563 --> 03:49.981
Well, I see better from a distance.

03:50.148 --> 03:51.858
Have you seen anything
that might set this thing off?

03:52.525 --> 03:54.736
Doctor, it's spiking again.

03:54.903 --> 03:56.321
BARTON: No one's come or gone.

03:56.487 --> 03:58.156
And Selvig's clean.

03:58.323 --> 04:00.491
No contacts, no IMs.

sir, it wasn't at this end.

04:04.829 --> 04:06.205
"At this end"?

04:06.372 --> 04:10.293
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to
the other end of space, right?

07:38.543 --> 07:39.961

17:35.973 --> 17:37.599
What if I say no?

17:38.058 --> 17:40.018
I'll persuade you.

17:42.312 --> 17:46.692
And what if the other guy says no?

17:47.359 --> 17:49.027
You've been more than a year
without an incident.

17:49.194 --> 17:51.488
I don't think you want to
break that streak.

17:53.991 --> 17:56.660
Well, I don't every time get what I want.

17:57.661 --> 17:59.621
Doctor, we're facing a potential
global catastrophe.

18:00.706 --> 18:03.584
(CHUCKLES) Well,
those I actively try to avoid.

18:04.168 --> 18:06.253
This

18:06.420 --> 18:08.547
is the Tesseract.

18:08.672 --> 18:11.508
It has the potential energy
to wipe out the planet.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.513
What does Fury want me to do,
swallow it?

18:17.014 --> 18:19.266
He wants you to find it. It's been taken.

18:20.309 --> 18:24.521
It emits a gamma signature
that's too weak for us to trace.

18:24.688 --> 18:27.649
There's no one that knows
gamma radiation like you do.

18:27.816 --> 18:30.319
If there was, that's where I'd be.

18:31.195 --> 18:33.155
So, Fury isn't after the monster?

18:33.572 --> 18:34.865
Not that he's told me.

18:35.032 --> 18:37.242
And he tells you everything?

18:37.868 --> 18:39.495
Talk to Fury. He needs you on this.

18:39.578 --> 18:40.746
He needs me in a cage?

18:40.829 --> 18:41.789
No one's going to put you in a...

18:41.872 --> 18:42.664
Stop lying to me!

18:42.748 --> 18:43.916
(COCKS GUN)

18:46.919 --> 18:49.588
I'm sorry. That was mean.

18:50.506 --> 18:52.716
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

18:53.884 --> 18:56.887
Why don't we do this the easy way

18:57.054 --> 18:58.347
where you don't use that

18:58.514 --> 19:02.226
and the other guy
doesn't make a mess.

19:03.227 --> 19:04.561
Okay?

19:05.521 --> 19:06.897
Natasha?

19:12.528 --> 19:13.612
Stand down.

19:14.530 --> 19:16.114
<i>We're good here.</i>

19:17.908 --> 19:19.243
"Just you and me."

19:21.620 --> 19:24.248
<i>This is out of line, Director.</i>

19:24.414 --> 19:26.875
<i>You're dealing
with forces you can't control.</i>

19:27.251 --> 19:30.754
You ever been in a war,
Councilman? In a firefight?

19:30.921 --> 19:33.757
Did you feel
an overabundance of control?

19:33.924 --> 19:37.344
<i>You're saying that this Asgard
is declaring war on our planet?</i>

19:37.427 --> 19:40.097
Not Asgard. Loki.

19:40.264 --> 19:43.100
<i>He can't be working alone.
What about the other one?</i>

19:43.183 --> 19:44.268
<i>His brother.</i>

19:44.351 --> 19:46.311
Our intelligence says
Thor is not a hostile

19:46.603 --> 19:47.604
but he's worlds away.

19:47.771 --> 19:49.606
We can't depend on him to help, either.

19:49.690 --> 19:50.691
It's up to us.

19:50.774 --> 19:53.443
<i>Which is why you
should be focusing on Phase 2.</i>

19:53.610 --> 19:54.778
<i>It was designed for exactly this...</i>

19:55.112 --> 19:57.948
Phase 2 isn't ready. Our enemy is.

19:58.532 --> 20:00.117
We need a response team.

20:00.284 --> 20:02.452
<i>The Avengers Initiative was shut down.</i>

20:02.619 --> 20:04.454
This isn't about the Avengers.

20:04.788 --> 20:05.956
<i>We've seen the list.</i>

20:06.123 --> 20:08.375
<i>You're running the world's greatest
covert security network</i>

20:08.458 --> 20:10.127
<i>and you're going to leave
the fate of the human race</i>

20:10.252 --> 20:11.545
<i>to a handful of freaks.</i>

20:11.628 --> 20:13.589
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.

20:13.755 --> 20:15.674
We need a response team.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.969
These people may be isolated,
unbalanced even

20:19.136 --> 20:23.223
but I believe with the right push
they can be exactly what we need.

20:23.599 --> 20:24.975
<i>You believe?</i>

20:25.142 --> 20:28.478
<i>War isn't won by sentiment, Director.</i>

20:29.396 --> 20:32.816
No, it's won by soldiers.

(PANTING)

21:30.832 --> 21:32.626
Trouble sleeping?

21:33.919 --> 21:36.380
I slept for 70 years, sir.
I think I've had my fill.

21:38.131 --> 21:41.802
Then you should be out,
celebrating, seeing the world.

21:47.891 --> 21:50.769
When I went under,
the world was at war.

21:50.936 --> 21:52.479
I wake up, they say we won.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.731
They didn't say what we lost.

21:55.607 --> 21:57.693
We've made some mistakes
along the way.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.736
Some, very recently.

22:01.571 --> 22:02.823
Are you here with a mission, sir?

22:02.906 --> 22:03.949
I am.

22:04.032 --> 22:05.450
Trying to get me back in the world?

22:06.201 --> 22:07.619
Trying to save it.

22:12.541 --> 22:14.584
ROGERS: HYDRA'S secret weapon.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.545
FURY: Howard Stark fished that
out of the ocean

22:16.628 --> 22:17.796
when he was looking for you.

22:18.630 --> 22:19.965
He thought what we think.

22:20.549 --> 22:24.386
The Tesseract could be the key
to unlimited sustainable energy.

22:25.137 --> 22:28.724
That's something
the world sorely needs.

22:30.475 --> 22:31.685
Who took it from you?

22:31.852 --> 22:33.311
He's called Loki.

22:33.478 --> 22:35.772
He's not from around here.

22:36.606 --> 22:38.692
There's a lot we'll have to
bring you up to speed on

22:38.775 --> 22:40.027
if you're in.

22:40.944 --> 22:42.654
The world has gotten even stranger

22:42.779 --> 22:43.905
than you already know.

22:44.656 --> 22:46.992
At this point, I doubt
anything would surprise me.

22:47.868 --> 22:49.286
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

22:51.288 --> 22:52.706
There's a debriefing packet

22:52.789 --> 22:55.208
waiting for you back at your apartment.

22:57.377 --> 22:59.337
Is there anything you can
tell us about the Tesseract

22:59.629 --> 23:00.839
that we ought to know now?

23:01.131 --> 23:03.467
You should have left it in the ocean.

24:43.483 --> 24:45.694
Of course they are.
I was directly involved.

Which brings me to my next question.

24:47.195 --> 24:49.239
How does it feel to be a genius?

24:49.406 --> 24:51.658
Well, I really wouldn't know,
now would I?

24:51.825 --> 24:56.371
What do you mean?
All this came from you.

24:56.538 --> 24:59.916
No, all this came from that.

Give yourself some credit. Please.

12%? My baby?

25:12.012 --> 25:13.680

25:25.025 --> 25:27.444
I'm going to pay for that
comment about percentages

25:27.611 --> 25:29.237
in some subtle way later, aren't I?

25:29.988 --> 25:31.281
It's not going to be that subtle.

25:31.448 --> 25:32.741

You know, I thought we were
having a moment.

26:49.693 --> 26:50.986
I was having 12% of a moment.

So, any chance
you're driving by LaGuardia?

- COULSON: I can drop you.
- Fantastic.

27:45.040 --> 27:46.082

So, this Dr Banner was trying
to replicate the serum they used on me?

28:10.565 --> 28:12.150
A lot of people were.

28:12.317 --> 28:13.777

I watched you while you were sleeping.

I mean, I was present

while you were
unconscious from the ice.

46:12.771 --> 46:13.772
Well, yes.

46:13.939 --> 46:16.442
Then you miss the truth
of ruling, brother.

- I am a king!
- Not here!

nor any world known.

An army

53:18.488 --> 53:20.240

So, he's building another portal.

- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.

53:43.054 --> 53:44.973
Loki is beyond reason,
but he is of Asgard.

And he is my brother.

He killed 80 people in two days.

53:49.644 --> 53:50.645

need the iridium for?

53:55.483 --> 53:56.484

I'll fly you to Portland.

53:59.863 --> 54:01.489
Keep love alive.

54:01.656 --> 54:03.575
It means the portal
won't collapse on itself

54:03.658 --> 54:05.577

54:05.744 --> 54:09.039
No hard feelings, Point Break.
You've got a mean swing.

54:09.205 --> 54:11.499
Also, it means the portal
can open as wide

54:11.666 --> 54:14.169
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

54:14.836 --> 54:16.838

but we did.

54:26.181 --> 54:27.557
How does Fury even see these?

54:27.641 --> 54:28.683
He turns.

54:29.184 --> 54:30.852
Sounds exhausting.

54:31.853 --> 54:33.104
The rest of the raw materials,

54:33.271 --> 54:36.066
Agent Barton can get
his hands on pretty easily.

54:36.232 --> 54:37.692
The only major component
he still needs

54:37.859 --> 54:41.363
is a power source
of high-energy density.

54:41.529 --> 54:44.658
Something to kick-start the Cube.

54:45.033 --> 54:47.744
When did you become an expert
in thermonuclear astrophysics?

54:47.827 --> 54:48.912
Last night.

54:49.704 --> 54:52.916
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the extraction theory papers.

54:53.083 --> 54:54.125
Am I the only one who did the reading?

54:54.292 --> 54:57.087
Does Loki need any particular
kind of power source?

54:57.253 --> 55:00.048
He would have to heat the Cube
to 120-million Kelvin

55:00.215 --> 55:01.716
just to break through
the Coulomb barrier.

55:01.883 --> 55:04.135
Unless Selvig has figured out
how to stabilise

55:04.302 --> 55:05.428
the quantum tunnelling effect.

55:05.595 --> 55:06.805
BANNER: Well, if he could do that,

55:06.888 --> 55:09.349
he could achieve heavy ion fusion
at any reactor on the planet.

55:09.432 --> 55:11.893
Finally, someone who speaks English.

55:12.060 --> 55:13.937
Is that what just happened?

55:14.229 --> 55:16.272
It's good to meet you, Dr Banner.

55:16.439 --> 55:19.567
Your work on antielectron
collisions is unparalleled.

55:19.734 --> 55:21.569
And I'm a huge fan of the way
you lose control

55:21.736 --> 55:23.613
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

55:25.323 --> 55:26.408

55:26.574 --> 55:29.077
Dr Banner is only here
to track the Cube.

55:29.244 --> 55:30.578
I was hoping you might join him.

55:30.745 --> 55:31.746
ROGERS:
I would start with that stick of his.

55:32.080 --> 55:33.039
It may be magical,

55:33.123 --> 55:34.582
but it works an awful lot
like a HYDRA weapon.

55:34.666 --> 55:37.585
I don't know about that,
but it is powered by the Cube.

55:37.961 --> 55:39.713
And I would like to know
how Loki used it

55:39.921 --> 55:41.589
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

55:41.673 --> 55:43.425
into his personal flying monkeys.

55:43.800 --> 55:45.301
Monkeys? I do not understand.

55:45.552 --> 55:46.386
I do.

55:49.472 --> 55:51.099
I understood that reference.

55:52.267 --> 55:53.643
Shall we play, Doctor?

55:53.810 --> 55:55.437
This way, sir.

56:09.534 --> 56:11.119
The gamma readings
are definitely consistent

56:11.286 --> 56:13.079
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

56:13.705 --> 56:15.373
But it's going to take weeks to process.

56:15.540 --> 56:16.791
If we bypass their mainframe

56:16.875 --> 56:18.168
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

56:18.334 --> 56:21.463
we can clock this
at around 600 teraflops.

56:22.630 --> 56:24.632
All I packed was a toothbrush.

56:25.633 --> 56:27.302

56:31.473 --> 56:34.059

I was in New York,

56:34.225 --> 56:36.811
I kind of broke Harlem.

56:36.978 --> 56:38.813

56:52.827 --> 56:54.579
Threatening the safety
of everyone on this ship

56:54.662 --> 56:55.955
isn't funny.

56:56.039 --> 56:57.040
No of fence, Doc.

56:57.123 --> 56:58.750
It's all right,
I wouldn't have come aboard

56:58.833 --> 57:01.711
if I couldn't handle pointy things.

57:01.795 --> 57:04.172
You're tip-toeing, big man.
You need to strut.

57:04.506 --> 57:06.216
And you need to focus
on the problem, Mr Stark.

57:06.299 --> 57:07.675
STARK: Do you think I'm not?

57:07.926 --> 57:10.762
Why did Fury call us in?
Why now? Why not before?

57:10.845 --> 57:12.555
What isn't he telling us?

57:12.639 --> 57:14.182
I can't do the equation unless
I have all the variables.

57:14.808 --> 57:16.142
You think Fury's hiding something?

57:16.476 --> 57:19.646
He's a spy. Captain, he's "the" spy.

57:19.729 --> 57:21.564
His secrets have secrets.

57:21.648 --> 57:23.149
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

57:23.233 --> 57:24.234
Uh...

57:25.360 --> 57:26.861
I just want to finish my work here, and...

57:27.529 --> 57:28.530
Doctor?

57:34.035 --> 57:36.454
"A warm light for all mankind."

57:36.538 --> 57:38.540
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

57:38.748 --> 57:39.999
I heard it.

57:40.083 --> 57:42.418
I think that was meant for you.

57:43.336 --> 57:46.339
Even if Barton didn't
tell Loki about the tower,

57:46.422 --> 57:47.465
it was still all over the news.

57:47.674 --> 57:49.634
The Stark Tower? That big, ugly

57:50.885 --> 57:52.095
building in New York?

57:52.428 --> 57:56.182
It's powered by an arc reactor,
a self-sustaining energy source.

57:56.266 --> 57:58.768
That building will run itself
for, what, a year?

57:58.852 --> 58:00.687
It's just the prototype.

58:00.770 --> 58:02.647
I'm kind of the only name
in clean energy right now.

58:03.064 --> 58:04.482
That's what he's getting at.

58:04.566 --> 58:07.235
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. bring him in
on the Tesseract project?

58:07.402 --> 58:09.195
What are they doing
in the energy business

58:09.279 --> 58:10.572
in the first place?

58:10.738 --> 58:13.741
I should probably look into that
once my decryption program

58:13.867 --> 58:15.827
finishes breaking into all of
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

58:15.910 --> 58:16.870
I'm sorry. Did you say...

58:16.953 --> 58:19.080
Jarvis has been running it
since I hit the bridge.

58:19.414 --> 58:20.999
In a few hours,
I'll know every dirty secret

58:21.082 --> 58:22.333
S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever tried to hide.

they didn't want you around.

58:25.545 --> 58:28.173
An intelligence organisation
that fears intelligence?

58:28.506 --> 58:30.133
Historically, not awesome.

58:30.216 --> 58:32.510
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

58:32.594 --> 58:34.220
This is a man who means to start a war

58:34.304 --> 58:35.763
and if we don't stay focused,
he'll succeed.

58:37.056 --> 58:39.559
We have orders.
We should follow them.

58:40.101 --> 58:41.936

I'm wondering if they shouldn't have
kept him on ice.

59:15.803 --> 59:17.096
Huh.

59:17.180 --> 59:18.932
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

59:19.015 --> 59:20.850
He does have the jump on us.

59:20.934 --> 59:23.686
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

59:23.770 --> 59:25.605
It's going to blow up in his face.

59:25.688 --> 59:27.815
And I'm going to be there when it does.

59:28.316 --> 59:30.485
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

You see, I don't get a suit of armour.

59:39.160 --> 59:42.580
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

59:42.664 --> 59:44.165
It's a nightmare.

59:47.460 --> 59:49.504

- Because I learned how.

01:00:02.767 --> 01:00:03.768
It's different.

Hey, I read all about your accident.

01:00:07.689 --> 01:00:10.900
That much gamma exposure
should have killed you.

01:00:11.192 --> 01:00:13.695

That's nice.

01:00:19.993 --> 01:00:23.705
It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?

01:00:25.039 --> 01:00:26.874
I guess we'll find out.

where the Tesseract is?

01:02:56.357 --> 01:02:59.694
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.

it's vengeance, upon me.

Loki is a prisoner.

Then why do I feel like
he's the only person on this boat

01:03:22.884 --> 01:03:24.260
that wants to be here?

no more virtuous than yourself

that levelled a small town.

01:08:21.974 --> 01:08:24.100

not only are we not alone

is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

01:08:45.038 --> 01:08:46.499
It is a signal to all the realms

01:08:46.582 --> 01:08:49.292
that the Earth is ready
for a higher form of war.

01:08:49.376 --> 01:08:50.461
A higher form?

01:08:50.544 --> 01:08:51.670
You forced our hand.

01:08:51.754 --> 01:08:52.755
We had to come up with something.

01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:55.251

on his hands that Loki does.

01:36:08.681 --> 01:36:10.099
But right now,
we got to put that behind us

If we can put together a list...

01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:15.521
He made it personal.

01:36:15.855 --> 01:36:16.856
That's not the point.

01:36:17.022 --> 01:36:19.442
That is the point. That's Loki's point.

01:36:19.650 --> 01:36:21.318
He hit us all right where we live. Why?

01:36:21.694 --> 01:36:22.736
To tear us apart.

01:36:23.195 --> 01:36:24.697
Yeah, divide and conquer is great

01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:27.283
but he knows he has to
take us out to win, right?

01:36:27.366 --> 01:36:28.951
That's what he wants.

01:36:29.034 --> 01:36:31.287
He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.

01:36:31.454 --> 01:36:32.538
He wants an audience.

01:36:33.539 --> 01:36:35.207
Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

01:36:35.291 --> 01:36:38.294
Yeah, that was just previews.
This is opening night.

<i>It just seems that there's
a lot they're not telling us.</i>

02:10:12.055 --> 02:10:15.309
<i>Superheroes in New York?
Give me a break.</i>

02:10:15.601 --> 02:10:17.561
<i>These so-called "heroes"</i>

02:10:17.644 --> 02:10:18.979
<i>have to be held responsible</i>

02:10:19.062 --> 02:10:21.315
<i>for the destruction done to this city.</i>

02:10:21.398 --> 02:10:23.525
<i>This was their fight.
Where are they now?</i>

02:10:23.609 --> 02:10:24.943
REPORTER:
<i>Tough questions are being asked</i>

02:10:25.027 --> 02:10:26.487
<i>about the Avengers themselves.</i>

02:10:26.570 --> 02:10:27.654
<i>Their sudden appearance</i>

02:10:27.738 --> 02:10:29.156
<i>and equally sudden disappearance...</i>

02:10:29.239 --> 02:10:32.075
<i>WOMAN: What,
this is all somehow their fault?</i>

02:10:34.077 --> 02:10:37.247
<i>Captain America saved my life.</i>

02:10:39.374 --> 02:10:42.878
<i>Wherever he is, and
wherever any of them are,</i>

02:10:42.961 --> 02:10:44.505
<i>I would just.</i> ..

02:10:45.255 --> 02:10:47.591
<i>I would want to say thank you.</i>

02:10:50.052 --> 02:10:51.595
<i>Where are the Avengers?</i>

02:10:51.929 --> 02:10:54.097
I'm not currently
tracking their whereabouts.

02:10:54.181 --> 02:10:56.391
I'd say they've earned
a leave of absence.

02:10:56.475 --> 02:10:58.101
<i>COUNCILWOMAN: And the Tesseract?</i>

02:10:58.185 --> 02:11:00.270
FURY:
The Tesseract is where it belongs

02:11:00.896 --> 02:11:03.273
<i>Out of our reach.</i>

02:11:03.482 --> 02:11:04.900
<i>COUNCILMAN 1: That's not your call.</i>

02:11:04.983 --> 02:11:06.026
I didn't make it.

02:11:06.151 --> 02:11:08.237
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

02:11:08.529 --> 02:11:10.197
<i>COUNCILMAN 1: So, you let him take it</i>

02:11:10.447 --> 02:11:12.115
<i>and the war criminal, Loki,</i>

02:11:12.199 --> 02:11:13.992
<i>who should be
answering for his crime.</i>

02:11:14.076 --> 02:11:16.411
<i>FURY: Oh, I think he Will be.</i>

02:11:30.133 --> 02:11:32.511
<i>COUNCILWOMAN: I don't think you
understand what you've started,</i>

02:11:32.886 --> 02:11:35.180
<i>letting the Avengers
loose on this world.</i>

02:11:35.597 --> 02:11:36.640
<i>They're dangerous.</i>

02:11:37.015 --> 02:11:40.519
<i>FU RY: They surely are,
and the whole world knows it.</i>

02:11:41.228 --> 02:11:43.564
Every world knows it.

02:11:44.231 --> 02:11:46.191
<i>Was that the point of all this?</i>

02:11:46.483 --> 02:11:48.026
<i>A statement?</i>

02:11:50.904 --> 02:11:52.406
<i>FU RY: A promise.</i>

02:12:00.872 --> 02:12:02.457
<i>HILL: Sir, how does it work now?</i>

02:12:03.750 --> 02:12:05.794
They've gone their separate ways.

02:12:05.877 --> 02:12:08.839
Some, pretty extremely far.

02:12:09.548 --> 02:12:11.550
If we get into a situation like this again,

02:12:11.633 --> 02:12:12.968
what happens then?

02:12:13.051 --> 02:12:14.094
They'll come back.

02:12:15.762 --> 02:12:17.264
HILL: Are you really sure about that?

02:12:17.347 --> 02:12:18.348
FURY: lam.

02:12:20.225 --> 02:12:21.518
Why?

02:12:22.519 --> 02:12:24.396
Because we'll need them to.

02:12:40.621 --> 02:12:42.372
(TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING)

02:15:16.276 --> 02:15:18.820
THE OTHER: Humans.

02:15:20.030 --> 02:15:24.451
They are not the cowering
wretches we were promised.

02:15:25.368 --> 02:15:27.537
They stand.

02:15:28.371 --> 02:15:33.585
They are unruly,
and therefore cannot be ruled.

02:15:41.802 --> 02:15:44.721
To challenge them

02:15:44.805 --> 02:15:48.183
is to court death.
