00:02.773 --> 00:04.605
(pop version
of "Jingle Bells" playing)

00:04.605 --> 00:06.637
NOW MR. LINZER
HATES THE FOOD,

00:06.637 --> 00:08.139
SO HE WILL TELL YOU
HE FEELS FINE.

00:08.139 --> 00:09.680
HE DOES NOT FEEL FINE.

00:09.680 --> 00:12.012
AND IF YOU RELEASE HIM
BEFORE HIS I.N.R. STABILIZES,

00:12.012 --> 00:13.444
HE WILL BLEED TO DEATH.

00:13.444 --> 00:15.015
MURPHY'S GONNA
KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.148
(woman)
♪ O'ER THE FIELDS WE GO ♪

00:17.148 --> 00:18.589
I AM GONNA KEEP
AN EYE ON HIM.

00:18.589 --> 00:19.750
(elevator bell dings)

00:19.750 --> 00:21.092
MRS. GELLMAN'S
STILL INTUBATED,

00:21.092 --> 00:23.054
BUT I WANT THE TUBE OUT
BY MONDAY.

00:23.054 --> 00:25.796
HAVE THE NURSES PAGE YOU AS SOON
AS SHE STARTS BREATHING ON HER--

00:25.796 --> 00:27.328
I-I WILL ASK THEM MYSELF.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.729
OH, IT'S NOT TOO MUCH
FOR YOU?

00:28.729 --> 00:30.161
NOT AT ALL.

00:30.161 --> 00:31.662
AND YET, YOU'RE TRYING TO
FOB IT OFF TO PETUNIA HERE,

00:31.662 --> 00:34.305
WITH HER YEARS AND YEARS
OF EXPERIENCE IN CRITICAL CARE.

00:34.305 --> 00:35.466
I WANT YOU TO RELAX
ON YOUR HONEYMOON.

00:35.466 --> 00:36.637
I THOUGHT THAT
YOU'D BE REASSURED

00:36.637 --> 00:38.509
BY HAVING TWO SETS OF EYES
ON YOUR PATIENTS.

00:38.509 --> 00:41.472
THE NOTION OF AN INTERN
HANDLING MY PATIENTS

00:41.472 --> 00:43.244
IS THE BEST WAY
I CAN THINK OF

00:43.244 --> 00:45.316
TO RUIN A PERFECTLY GOOD
MAI TAI.

00:45.316 --> 00:47.218
OH, ARE YOU GOING
SOMEPLACE WARM?

00:47.218 --> 00:48.649
WE DON'T
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.582
OH, NO. I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT MY HONEYMOON--

00:51.582 --> 00:53.084
THE HOTEL, THE SIGHTS...

00:53.084 --> 00:54.555
I'M GONNA HANDLE
MRS. GELLMAN MYSELF.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.557
WHAT I'M WEARING ON THE PLANE,
WHAT I'M WEARING ON THE BEACH.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.089
LEAH, LEAVE.

00:58.089 --> 00:59.230
AND THE WEDDING--SHOULD I
GET MY NAILS DONE TODAY

00:59.230 --> 01:01.132
OR TOMORROW ON MY WAY
TO THE CEREMONY?

01:01.132 --> 01:02.733
OKAY, SHE'S GONE.
I GOT THIS.

01:02.733 --> 01:04.135
(ding)

01:04.135 --> 01:05.636
(Meredith) THE ADRENAL SYSTEM
REACTS TO STRESS

01:05.636 --> 01:08.339
BY RELEASING HORMONES THAT
MAKES US ALERT AND REACTIVE.

01:08.339 --> 01:10.101
THE PROBLEM IS,

01:10.101 --> 01:14.145
THE ADRENAL SYSTEM CAN'T TELL
WHAT'S A REGULAR CASE OF NERVES

01:14.145 --> 01:16.107
AND WHAT'S
A REAL IMPENDING DISASTER.

01:16.107 --> 01:17.608
YO, LEFKOWITZ.

01:17.608 --> 01:19.680
DID YOU BRING IT?

01:19.680 --> 01:21.512
(man) THAT'S THE WHOLE THING?
YEP.

01:21.512 --> 01:23.184
LEFKOWITZ HAS GASTROPARESIS

01:23.184 --> 01:24.315
SO HE CAN'T DIGEST HIS FOOD.

01:24.315 --> 01:26.157
HE WAS AN EPIC PUKER
FOR A LONG TIME,

01:26.157 --> 01:27.658
AND NOW HE CAN'T REALLY
EAT AT ALL.

01:27.658 --> 01:31.822
SO WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU
A GASTRIC NEUROSTIMULATOR.
(groans)

01:31.822 --> 01:33.494
THIS THING,
IT'S GONNA ZAP YOUR STOMACH

01:33.494 --> 01:35.496
SO IT REMEMBERS

01:35.496 --> 01:37.097
TO PUSH THE FOOD
DOWN YOUR SYSTEM.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.699
GET YOU BACK
ON BURGERS AND FRIES.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.201
THAT'S AMAZING.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.302
YEAH, WELL, THE GUYS

01:41.302 --> 01:43.134
AT THE AIRPORT X-RAY
ARE GONNA GO NUTS.

01:43.134 --> 01:44.235
THAT'S SICK.

01:44.235 --> 01:46.237
OH, UH, THIS IS DR. WILSON.

01:46.237 --> 01:47.538
SHE'S GONNA BE OPERATING
WITH ME.

01:47.538 --> 01:50.481
YOU'VE GOT A-A CRACK TEAM,

GET TO THE WEDDING TOMORROW...

02:07.698 --> 02:09.700
MM-HMM.
DON'T SIT DOWN.

02:09.700 --> 02:11.232
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
DON'T SIT DOWN?

02:11.232 --> 02:15.366
JUST FIND A PLACE
AND STAND THERE.

02:15.366 --> 02:16.837
YOU WANT US TO STAND
IN THE BACK?

02:16.837 --> 02:18.309
THEN WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO HEAR ANYTHING.

02:18.309 --> 02:19.910
STAND IN THE DAMN FRONT.

02:19.910 --> 02:21.472
AND BLOCK EVERYBODY'S VIEW?

02:21.472 --> 02:22.813
(sighs)
I MEAN, IF WE'RE--
I DON'T--

02:22.813 --> 02:24.275
JUST PICK A SPOT.

02:24.275 --> 02:26.247
YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT COMPLICATED. UGH!

02:26.247 --> 02:29.620
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ALLOW YOU
TO OPEN THEM UP WITH A KNIFE.

02:29.620 --> 02:31.422
IF THEY KNEW YOU COULDN'T
FOLLOW A SIMPLE INSTRUCTION,

02:31.422 --> 02:33.654
THEY WOULD RUN LIKE THE WIND
FROM THIS PLACE. (exhales)
(elevator bell dings)

02:33.654 --> 02:35.456
ARE YOU...

02:35.456 --> 02:38.259
ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY,
"WOULD YOU DO ME THE HONOR

02:38.259 --> 02:40.261
OF BEING MY BRIDESMAIDS?"

02:40.261 --> 02:42.733
DOES THE WHOLE THING
HAVE TO BE ABOUT YOU?

02:42.733 --> 02:45.566
JUST PUT ON A DRESS
AND DON'T SIT DOWN.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.268
AWW. WE'RE BRIDESMAIDS.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.239
OH, DON'T EVEN---

02:48.239 --> 02:49.800
JU--JU--SEE? UGH.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.343
THIS IS WHAT
I WAS TRYING TO AVOID.
OHH.

02:52.343 --> 02:54.645
NOW ONCE I REMOVE
THE SURAL NERVE FROM YOUR LEG,

02:54.645 --> 02:58.178
DR. TORRES WILL GRAFT IT ON TO
DR. SHEPHERD'S MEDIAN NERVE.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.211
YOU'LL LIKELY EXPERIENCE
SOME DISCOMFORT

03:00.211 --> 03:01.412
IN YOUR LEG FOR A FEW WEEKS--

03:01.412 --> 03:02.913
MONTHS. MONTHS.

03:02.913 --> 03:05.216
AND WHEN HE SAYS "DISCOMFORT,"
IT'S GONNA HURT LIKE HELL.

03:05.216 --> 03:06.357
WELL, YOU'RE A BAG
OF SUNSHINE, AREN'T YOU?

03:06.357 --> 03:07.718
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
SIX MONTHS FROM NOW

03:07.718 --> 03:09.220
THAT YOU CAN'T MOVE

03:09.220 --> 03:11.662
AND THAT THE IBUPROFEN
HURTS YOUR STOMACH.

03:11.662 --> 03:13.193
HE MAKES ME SOUND LIKE
I'M A 90-YEAR-OLD MAN.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.465
HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT?

03:14.465 --> 03:15.796
BECAUSE I'VE HEARD FOR DECADES
HOW I RUINED YOUR LIFE...

03:15.796 --> 03:17.668
BECAUSE YOU DID.
AND THAT MOM DOESN'T LOVE YOU.

03:17.668 --> 03:19.500
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T.
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT THIS.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.572
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO SAY IS "THANK YOU, LIZZIE,

03:21.572 --> 03:23.203
FOR CUTTING OFF A LEG
AND GIVING IT TO ME."

03:23.203 --> 03:25.205
AH. HERE IT IS. THIS IS HOW
IT'S GONNA GO DOWN IN HISTORY.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.207
IT IS A NERVE.
IT IS NOT THE ENTIRE LEG.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.209
OKAY. LET'S FOCUS.
JACKSON.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.711
UM, I THINK
DR. SHEPHERD'S RIGHT.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.713
IF YOU'RE UNSURE, WE--
OH, COME ON.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.585
I'M JUST WINDING HIM UP
BECAUSE IT IS SO EASY.

03:34.585 --> 03:36.216
JUST GIVE ME THE FORM.
OKAY.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.218
(clears throat)

03:40.220 --> 03:43.724
NOW CAN I GO HANG OUT
WITH ZOLA IN DAY CARE?

03:43.724 --> 03:44.895
OH, I'M SORRY.

03:44.895 --> 03:46.497
THEY DON'T LET THE ADULTS
COME AND GO

03:46.497 --> 03:48.228
BECAUSE IT'S HARDER
ON THE KIDS.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.305
I WILL BRING HER TO YOU LATER.

03:54.305 --> 03:55.836

04:02.313 --> 04:04.275
UH, WHEN YOU GET
TO THE WEDDING TOMORROW,

04:04.275 --> 04:05.616
DON'T SIT DOWN.

04:05.616 --> 04:07.818

CALL FOR A PORTABLE ECHO.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.821
THE LAWYER
PUT TOGETHER THE PAPERS.

04:10.821 --> 04:12.353
THEY'RE GONNA
SEND THEM OVER TOMORROW.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.355
OH, I SIGNED A BUNCH OF STUFF
WITH THEM LAST WEEK.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.457
UH, NOT THE PLANE CRASH.
THE DIVORCE.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.258
OH.

04:19.390 --> 04:20.361
THAT WAS FAST.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.463
I SAID WE WANTED
TO MOVE QUICKLY.

04:22.463 --> 04:23.634
APPARENTLY.

04:23.634 --> 04:25.996
IT'S ALL DONE.
YOU JUST HAVE TO SIGN.

04:25.996 --> 04:27.598
(exhales)
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

04:27.598 --> 04:28.769
NOPE.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.901
TOMORROW, WITH A PEN.

04:35.746 --> 04:37.648
(woman) OKAY.

04:37.648 --> 04:39.580
EVERYTHING OFF
FROM THE WAIST DOWN.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.852
NICE PAPER TABLECLOTH
FOR YOU. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

04:43.514 --> 04:45.816
YOU KNOW, UM...

04:45.816 --> 04:47.458
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
TELLING LIZZIE

04:47.458 --> 04:48.989
IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.392
(door closes)
UM, I THINK
IT'S STILL KIND OF EARLY.

04:51.392 --> 04:52.893
YEAH, BUT SHE'S DOING
THIS THING FOR ME.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.565
SHE'LL TELL
YOUR WHOLE ENTIRE FAMILY.

04:54.565 --> 04:56.497
WELL, YOU TOLD CRISTINA.
(jeans thud)

04:56.497 --> 04:58.369
I HAVEN'T.

04:58.369 --> 04:59.770
STILL?

04:59.770 --> 05:01.001
THERE'S NO POINT.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.333
I'M PROBABLY
GONNA MISCARRY ANYWAY.

05:02.333 --> 05:03.504
MEREDITH--

05:03.504 --> 05:04.675
I AM JUST STATING THE FACTS.

05:04.675 --> 05:06.006
I HAVE
A VERY UNSTABLE UTERUS.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.338
THIS BABY HAS
AN UPHILL CLIMB.

05:07.338 --> 05:09.309
I AM JUST BEING REALISTIC.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.512
(knock on door)
READY TO TAKE A LOOK?

05:11.512 --> 05:12.683
YEAH.

05:12.683 --> 05:14.545
(door closes)

05:14.545 --> 05:16.547
(chair wheels clatter)

05:16.547 --> 05:17.988
(exam table pieces clank)

05:17.988 --> 05:19.520
OKAY, SCOOT DOWN.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.652
NOW THERE'S STILL
A LOT WE CAN DO

05:21.652 --> 05:23.554
TO SUPPORT THE PREGNANCY,
RIGHT,

05:23.554 --> 05:25.496
EVEN WITH OUR HISTORY?

05:25.496 --> 05:27.327
OF COURSE.
YOU'VE GOT SOME RISK FACTORS.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.759
BUT WE'RE GONNA WATCH YOU
LIKE A HAWK.

05:28.759 --> 05:30.100
OKAY.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.963
(machine beeps)

05:32.963 --> 05:34.334
(clicks keyboard key)

05:34.334 --> 05:35.706

05:38.409 --> 05:40.871

playing over monitor)

05:40.871 --> 05:42.543
THERE WE GO.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.944
HI, BABY.

05:43.944 --> 05:47.918

05:51.121 --> 06:01.932

06:08.399 --> 06:09.570

06:09.570 --> 06:10.741
(laughs) GOOD NEWS.

06:10.741 --> 06:12.072
ARIZONA AND I BOTH HAVE
RED DRESSES.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.574
NOW THEY'RE NOT THE SAME,
BUT THEY ARE SIMILAR.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.106
SO IT'S NOT LIKE MATCHY-MATCHY,
BUT IT'LL BE SUPER CUTE.

06:16.106 --> 06:18.779
NOW WHICH PART OF MY FACE SAYS
I WANT SUPER CUTE?

06:18.779 --> 06:21.452
OHH. GET OVER IT ALREADY.
IT'S A WEDDING.

06:21.452 --> 06:23.554
NO ONE CARES THAT IT'S
YOUR SECOND OTHER THAN YOU.

06:23.554 --> 06:25.986
JUST HOLD YOUR NOSE.
IT'LL BE OVER IN A FEW HOURS.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.117
SURE.
AND THEN WE'LL BE MARRIED.

06:27.117 --> 06:30.090
AND, OH, HIM IN L.A.,
ME HERE WITH MY SON

06:30.090 --> 06:33.063
AND A JOB THAT'S KNOWN TO
TAKE UP A GREAT DEAL OF TIME.

06:33.063 --> 06:34.394
OH, AND HE'S AN INTERN,

06:34.394 --> 06:36.997
BECAUSE ONE SPECIALTY
WASN'T ENOUGH FOR HIM.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.469
LET'S GET TO THAT PART.
HUH.

06:38.469 --> 06:40.501
YOU KNOW, EVERYONE'S ACTING
LIKE I'M SOME JITTERY BRIDE.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.503
MAYBE I HAVE SOMETHING
TO JITTER ABOUT.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.134
WELL...

06:44.134 --> 06:47.137
IF IT'S THE MARRIAGE
YOU'RE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT...

06:47.137 --> 06:48.809
YOU CAN RUN.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.110
EXCUSE ME?

06:50.110 --> 06:52.082
LEAVE HIM AT THE ALTAR.
IT'S A CLEAN BREAK.

06:52.082 --> 06:53.584
HE'S SO PISSED THAT YOU
STOOD HIM UP

06:53.584 --> 06:55.846
IN FRONT OF ALL HIS PEOPLE,
THE WHOLE THING IS JUST OVER.

06:55.846 --> 06:57.688
AND THEN YOU'RE NOT WRESTLING
WITH A RELATIONSHIP

06:57.688 --> 06:58.989
THAT'S DOOMED

06:58.989 --> 07:00.851
OR TIED TO SOMEONE
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

07:00.851 --> 07:02.493
I MEAN, SURE,
YOU LOVE EACH OTHER NOW.

07:02.493 --> 07:03.794
BUT THE NEXT THING
YOU KNOW,

07:03.794 --> 07:05.756
YOU ARE CLEANING
HIS PEE OFF THE GROUND

07:05.756 --> 07:07.498
AND GOING TO BED

07:07.498 --> 07:09.429
WITH A FOOT-WIDE
DEMILITARIZED ZONE

07:09.429 --> 07:11.001
DOWN THE MIDDLE
OF THE BED.

07:11.001 --> 07:12.603
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

07:12.603 --> 07:14.465
(inhales) KIDDING.

07:14.465 --> 07:16.006
(laughs) I'M JUST KIDDING.
I'M KIDDING.
(elevator bell dings)

07:16.006 --> 07:17.708
NO, IT--IT'LL BE FINE.
IT'LL BE FINE.

07:17.708 --> 07:19.109
YEAH, BEN'S THE...

07:19.109 --> 07:20.671
THE BEST. HE'S...

07:20.671 --> 07:21.842
HE--

07:21.842 --> 07:23.514
(pop version of "Silver Bells"
playing)

07:23.514 --> 07:25.846
WE HAVE TO DO AN OPEN PROCEDURE
'CAUSE HE'S GOT ADHESIONS

07:25.846 --> 07:27.678
FROM A SURGERY
A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

07:27.678 --> 07:29.449
ONCE HE'S OPEN,

14:56.526 --> 14:58.068
LIZZIE--

14:58.068 --> 14:59.229
NO, WE'RE NOT DISCUSSING IT.
I'VE DECIDED.

14:59.229 --> 15:00.600
GET BACK ON THE HORSE,
DEREK.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.932
OH, OKAY. SO YOU THINK I'M
USING THIS AS AN EXCUSE,

15:01.932 --> 15:03.503
THAT I'M TOO SCARED TO TRY
AND OPERATE AGAIN?

15:03.503 --> 15:05.605
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
NOTHING SCARES YOU.

15:05.605 --> 15:08.378
MM.

15:08.378 --> 15:09.980
WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK?

15:09.980 --> 15:11.911
HMM? WHAT IF WE
GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS

15:11.911 --> 15:13.243
AND NOTHING COMES OF IT?

15:13.243 --> 15:15.515
WELL, THEN
AT LEAST WE TRIED.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.646
WE'RE DOING IT.

15:16.646 --> 15:18.688
JUST... SAY THANK YOU.

15:22.622 --> 15:23.994
YOU READY?

15:23.994 --> 15:25.125
YEP.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.227
BOVIE, PLEASE.
(exhales)

15:27.227 --> 15:28.498
THANK YOU.

15:28.498 --> 15:30.100
OKAY, HERE?

15:30.100 --> 15:31.261
YEP.

15:31.261 --> 15:32.432
TAKE YOUR TIME.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.603
OKAY.
(sizzling)

15:33.603 --> 15:34.564
WATCH OUT
FOR THE BLOOD VESSELS.

15:34.564 --> 15:36.967
WOW. LOOK AT YOU,
ALL GROWN-UP.

15:36.967 --> 15:38.638
UP IN THE SKILLS LAB,
I WAS DOING--

15:38.638 --> 15:40.010
(monitor beeping erratically)

15:40.010 --> 15:41.471
YOU PUT A HOLE
IN HIS STOMACH.

15:41.471 --> 15:42.973
I HAVEN'T EVEN--
MOVE, NOW. MOVE.

15:42.973 --> 15:44.274
ALL RIGHT. CLAMP.

15:44.274 --> 15:45.615
(woman) HERE YOU GO.
2.0 VICRYL.

15:45.615 --> 15:47.147
(woman) I'LL GET IT.
SUCTION.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.578
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

15:48.578 --> 15:50.320
HEY, STEPH.

15:50.320 --> 15:51.481
YOU OKAY THERE?

15:51.481 --> 15:52.582
FINE.
TERRIFIC.

15:52.582 --> 15:54.024
I WANTED TO ASK YOU--

15:54.024 --> 15:55.685
I WAS GONNA GO
TO THE WEDDING WITH,

15:55.685 --> 15:57.687
YOU KNOW, A FRIEND--
A GUY, LIKE, STAG.

15:57.687 --> 15:59.229
YEAH?

15:59.229 --> 16:01.561
AND NOW HE FEELS LIKE
I'M BAILING ON HIM.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.563
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
WITH ME.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.365
NO, NO.
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO?

16:05.365 --> 16:06.636
(singsongy)
YOU HAVE A DATE WITH GUY.

16:06.636 --> 16:08.999
I DITCHED HIM, AND I WANT YOU
TO FIND SOMEBODY FOR HIM.

16:08.999 --> 16:10.570
IS THAT WEIRD?

16:10.570 --> 16:12.402
(normal voice)
NOTHING ABOUT THIS IS WEIRD.

16:12.402 --> 16:13.573
TERRIFIC.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.345
MM-HMM. MM.
(elevator bell dings)

16:15.345 --> 16:16.606
(Alex) THERE'S STILL
SOME SPILLAGE.

16:16.606 --> 16:17.647
GIVE ME SOME LAP PADS...

16:17.647 --> 16:20.010
(monitor beeping erratically)
AND SOME 2.0 SILK.

16:20.010 --> 16:21.181
GET OVER HERE
AND GRAB THE RETRACTOR

16:21.181 --> 16:22.712
SO WE CAN PUT
THE DEVICE BACK IN.

16:22.712 --> 16:23.683
WILSON.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.055
I CAN'T GET MY HANDS
TO STAY STILL.

16:25.055 --> 16:26.216
WELL, SHAKE IT OFF
AND GET OVER HERE.

16:26.216 --> 16:27.687
THE KID'S GONNA BE FINE,

16:27.687 --> 16:29.219
JUST GRAB
THE DAMN RETRACTOR.

16:29.219 --> 16:30.390
(beeping continues)

16:30.390 --> 16:32.222
GET OUT.

16:32.222 --> 16:33.693
GO!

16:33.693 --> 16:36.696
(beeping continues)

16:36.696 --> 16:39.699
(panting)

16:47.207 --> 16:49.779
YOU THINK BAILEY WILL NOTICE
IF I'M NOT THERE?

16:49.779 --> 16:52.582
(scoffs) SHE JUST MADE YOU
A BRIDESMAID.

16:52.582 --> 16:54.284
OH, SHE DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT ALL OF THAT.

16:54.284 --> 16:55.645
SHE JUST WANTS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
STANDING UP THERE

16:55.645 --> 16:57.187
SO IT WON'T LOOK WEIRD

16:57.187 --> 16:59.119
WHEN BEN HAS ALL HIS GUYS
STANDING UP THERE.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.450
AND I HAVE A PACKED DAY
TOMORROW.

17:00.450 --> 17:01.691
YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU'RE GOING
TO A WEDDING.

17:01.691 --> 17:03.223
YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO WEAR HEELS...

17:03.223 --> 17:04.394
TO A FANCY OCCASION.

17:04.394 --> 17:05.625
OH, COME ON.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.098
NO, THEY MAKE YOU FEEL
TALL AND CONFIDENT

17:08.098 --> 17:10.400
AND FEMININE AND--

17:10.400 --> 17:13.032
AND MY PLASTIC FOOT ISN'T
THE RIGHT SHAPE FOR... HEELS.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.664
I DIDN'T GET THAT KIND.

17:14.664 --> 17:16.035
WELL, I MEAN--

17:16.035 --> 17:17.537
IT'S NOT NOTHING.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.139
I MEAN, WHY DO YOU THINK WOMEN
ALL OVER THE WORLD WEAR THEM?

17:19.139 --> 17:21.211
BECAUSE WOMEN ALL OVER
THE WORLD ARE STUPID.

17:21.211 --> 17:22.712
OH, OKAY. SO YOU'RE
GONNA WEAR FLATS?

17:22.712 --> 17:24.214
OH, I'D BE HAPPY
TO WEAR FLATS.

17:24.214 --> 17:25.775
OH, NO, YOU WOULDN'T BECAUSE
THEN YOU WOULD FEEL DUMPY.

17:25.775 --> 17:28.278
OH-HO. DID YOU
JUST CALL ME DUMPY?

17:28.278 --> 17:29.449
(laughs)

17:29.449 --> 17:30.750
CAN YOU JUST
FOR ONE SECOND ADMIT

17:30.750 --> 17:34.484
THAT YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS
I'M TALKING ABOUT?

17:34.484 --> 17:36.786
OKAY, I KNOW IT'S HARD.

17:36.786 --> 17:38.128
IT'S HARD ALL THE TIME,

17:38.128 --> 17:39.729
AND THIS IS JUST
ONE MORE REMINDER.

17:41.731 --> 17:44.764
BUT YOU ARE SO,
SO BEAUTIFUL.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.496
YEAH,
PEOPLE STAND NEXT TO YOU

17:46.496 --> 17:48.268
AND IMMEDIATELY
FEEL BAD ABOUT THEMSELVES.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.439
IT'S A PUBLIC SERVICE

17:49.439 --> 17:51.201
THAT YOU'RE
A COUPLE OF INCHES SHORTER.

17:51.201 --> 17:52.542
IT IS A KINDNESS

17:52.542 --> 17:54.804
TO EVERY OTHER WOMAN
AT THAT WEDDING

17:54.804 --> 17:56.746
THAT YOU ARE JUST

17:56.746 --> 17:58.348
ONE TINY BIT LESS BEAUTIFUL.

17:58.348 --> 17:59.809
(chuckles)
MM-HMM.

17:59.809 --> 18:00.780
YEAH.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.582
(mouths word)

18:21.131 --> 18:22.432
(sighs)

18:28.638 --> 18:31.681
ARE YOU STILL MAD AT ME
BECAUSE I CALLED LIZZIE?

18:31.681 --> 18:33.883
DO YOU STILL LOVE ME?

18:33.883 --> 18:35.585
(chuckles) MEDIUM.

18:35.585 --> 18:37.487
I JUST WANT YOUR HAND
TO BE BETTER

18:37.487 --> 18:41.491
SO THAT WE CAN PUT THIS STUPID
PLANE CRASH STUFF BEHIND US.

18:41.491 --> 18:44.454
WELL, THE LAWYER CALLED
TO SCHEDULE A DEPOSITION.

18:44.454 --> 18:46.356
HE THINKS
WE HAVE A STRONG CASE,

18:46.356 --> 18:49.799
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT CRISTINA
AND OWEN ARE GETTING DIVORCED.

18:51.661 --> 18:53.663
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

18:53.663 --> 18:55.405
WELL, IT'D BE A BIG
CONFLICT OF INTEREST

18:55.405 --> 18:58.538
IF OWEN WAS MARRIED
TO ONE OF THE PLAINTIFFS.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.510
THAT'S WHY THEY GOT DIVORCED,
RIGHT? SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU?

19:00.510 --> 19:03.873
NO. WHY WOULD SHE NOT
TELL ME THAT?

19:03.873 --> 19:06.776
YOU DIDN'T TELL HER
YOU WERE PREGNANT.

19:06.776 --> 19:10.380
MAYBE THINGS
ARE DIFFERENT NOW.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.324
(exhales)

19:19.629 --> 19:20.790
(bell dings)

19:20.790 --> 19:22.161
ON THE MORNING
OF YOUR WEDDING?

19:22.161 --> 19:24.764
OH, MY HOUSE IS FILLED
WITH MY FAMILY

19:24.764 --> 19:27.937
TALKING ABOUT MAKEUP
AND HAIR.

19:27.937 --> 19:30.200
JUST CHECK INTO A HOTEL.
(woman) DR. BAILEY.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.602
TAKE A NICE LONG BATH,
GET A MANICURE.

19:32.602 --> 19:34.604
OH, NOW I GOT YOU
TALKING ABOUT MAKEUP AND HAIR?

19:34.604 --> 19:36.476
DR. BAILEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

19:36.476 --> 19:37.707
CHECKING UP ON MY PATIENTS.

19:37.707 --> 19:39.449
MAKING SURE YOU HAVEN'T
BUNGLED ANYTHING.

19:39.449 --> 19:40.610
DON'T MENTION HER HAIR.

19:40.610 --> 19:42.212
WHY? DID SOMETHING
HAPPEN TO YOUR HAIR?

19:42.212 --> 19:44.314
(elevator bell dings)
OH.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.788
HE PROBABLY KNEW
IT WAS RISKY,

19:48.788 --> 19:51.421
SO HE WANTED IT ON ME
AND NOT HIM.

19:51.421 --> 19:53.423
YOU HAVE TO STOP.
YOU'RE MAKING YOURSELF CRAZY.

19:53.423 --> 19:54.594
I'M GONNA GET FIRED.

19:54.594 --> 19:55.725
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

19:55.725 --> 19:58.298
JUST KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN
AND DO YOUR WORK.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.970
(sighs) YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:00.970 --> 20:02.672
(man shouts indistinctly)

20:02.672 --> 20:03.633
NOW I HAVE TO
ASK YOU SOMETHING,

20:03.633 --> 20:04.804
AND IN LIGHT OF THE FACT

20:04.804 --> 20:05.975
THAT YOU THINK YOUR JOB
IS ON THE LINE,

20:05.975 --> 20:07.337
IT'S GONNA SOUND
REALLY STUPID.

20:07.337 --> 20:08.638
WHATEVER. IT'S OKAY.

20:08.638 --> 20:09.809
(sighs)

20:09.809 --> 20:12.582
DR. AVERY ASKED ME
TO DR. BAILEY'S WEDDING.

20:12.582 --> 20:14.914
AND I CAN'T PUT
TWO WORDS TOGETHER

20:14.914 --> 20:16.786
INTO A SENTENCE
WHEN I'M WITHIN 2 FEET OF HIM,

20:16.786 --> 20:18.418
AND HE'S BRINGING A FRIEND,

20:18.418 --> 20:19.719
AND HE ASKED ME
TO BRING A FRIEND,

20:19.719 --> 20:21.691
AND IT'LL BE
LIKE A BUNCH OF US,

20:21.691 --> 20:23.653
AND WE'LL ALL GO TOGETHER.

20:23.653 --> 20:26.626
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT SOUNDS REALLY STUPID.

20:26.626 --> 20:27.757
(sighs)

20:27.757 --> 20:29.459
BUT WILL YOU DO IT?

20:29.459 --> 20:31.731
(whiny voice) PLEASE, JO.

20:31.731 --> 20:32.702
SOMEBODY PAGE CARDIO?

20:32.702 --> 20:34.364
(clears throat)
YEAH, G.S.W. TO THE CHEST.

20:34.364 --> 20:35.665
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

20:35.665 --> 20:36.966
WE PUT UP 2 AND A HALF LITERS
OF BLOOD

20:36.966 --> 20:38.768
WHEN WE
PUT IN THE CHEST TUBE.

20:38.768 --> 20:40.610
(beeping continues)

20:40.610 --> 20:42.512
WE SHOULD MOVE HIM UPSTAIRS.

20:42.512 --> 20:43.813
THERE IS A BULLET
IN THE ABDOMEN.

20:43.813 --> 20:45.645
I CAN DO IT, OR WE CAN CALL
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.777
YOU CAN DO IT.
AMICABLE, RIGHT?

20:47.777 --> 20:49.719
MM-HMM.
LET'S MOVE.

20:49.719 --> 20:51.020
(people speaking indistinctly)

20:51.020 --> 20:53.583
YOU'RE STILL RECHECKING
KEPNER'S WORK?

20:53.583 --> 20:55.355
WHAT I WAS BORN TO DO.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.526
(clicks mouse)

20:56.526 --> 20:58.688
I HAVE A CHOLE
IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES.

20:58.688 --> 21:00.860
IN AND OUT, THE WHOLE THING
SHOULD TAKE AN HOUR.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.832
YOU WANT TO SCRUB IN?

21:04.834 --> 21:07.397
TAKE THE EDGE OFF BEFORE
YOU GO HOME AND GET DRESSED?

21:07.397 --> 21:09.739
(sighs)

21:09.739 --> 21:13.473
YOU... ARE A GOOD MAN.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.405
DR. WEBBER.

21:15.405 --> 21:16.746
OH, THE MAN OF THE HOUR.

21:16.746 --> 21:18.678
OH, TELL ME YOU'RE NOT HERE
TO TAKE ME BACK TO THAT HOUSE.

21:18.678 --> 21:19.979
(laughs) NO, I'M--I'M NOT.

21:19.979 --> 21:23.713
OKAY, WELL, HE, UM, JUST ASKED
ME TO DO A CHOLE WITH HIM...

21:23.713 --> 21:25.415
(voice breaking)
AND IT'S THE ONLY THING

21:25.415 --> 21:26.756
THAT'S CALMED ME DOWN
ON A DAY FULL OF PEOPLE

21:26.756 --> 21:28.488
TRYING AND FAILING
TO CALM ME DOWN.

21:28.488 --> 21:29.889
WHY DO YOU THINK
HE ASKED YOU?

21:32.362 --> 21:33.763
YOU CALLED HIM?

21:33.763 --> 21:34.894
OH.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.826
THANK YOU.

21:36.826 --> 21:37.767
(laughs)

21:37.767 --> 21:39.429
BOTH OF YOU.

21:39.429 --> 21:40.730
SO CAN I HAVE A CAR
PICK YOU UP AT THE HOUSE?

21:40.730 --> 21:42.772
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO
SAY NO TO THAT?

21:42.772 --> 21:43.773
A PERSON SHOULDN'T
DRIVE THEMSELVES

21:43.773 --> 21:45.304
TO THEIR OWN WEDDING.
WELL, I LIKE TO DRIVE.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.806
IN A WEDDING GOWN?

21:46.806 --> 21:49.609
Y--IT'S MY LAST TEN MINUTES
AS A SINGLE WOMAN.

21:49.609 --> 21:51.080
YOU KNOW, YOU BOTH
WERE ON A ROLL THERE.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.812
WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO SCREW IT UP NOW?

21:52.812 --> 21:54.844
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE O.R.

21:54.844 --> 21:57.347
AND I WILL SEE YOU

21:57.347 --> 21:59.719
AT THE ALTAR.

22:07.797 --> 22:09.859
(exhales)

22:09.859 --> 22:11.731
DR. ROBBINS.

22:11.731 --> 22:12.902
YEAH. HI.

22:12.902 --> 22:15.064
DR. KAREV HAD ME TAKE DOWN
THE ADHESIONS.

22:15.064 --> 22:16.806
YEAH. YEAH, HOW'D THAT GO?

22:16.806 --> 22:19.609
SOME OF THE ADHESIONS
WERE STUCK TO THE STOMACH.

22:19.609 --> 22:20.940
THE STOMACH WAS INJURED.

22:20.940 --> 22:23.643
HE COULD BE SEPTIC BY NOW.

22:23.643 --> 22:26.616
I DON'T THINK HE HAD
ANY BUSINESS

22:26.616 --> 22:28.848
HAVING AN INTERN
DO THAT KIND OF MOVE.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.920
I MEAN, YOU WERE PRETTY SHOCKED
TO HEAR THAT I WAS DOING IT.

22:30.920 --> 22:34.824
HE THREW ME IN THE DEEP END,
PROBABLY BECAUSE--

22:34.824 --> 22:35.925
OKAY, HANG ON.

22:35.925 --> 22:38.688
WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU SAYING
ABOUT YOUR ATTENDING?

22:40.029 --> 22:42.932
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

22:42.932 --> 22:44.764
(sighs) G.S.W.

22:44.764 --> 22:45.895
SWEET.

22:45.895 --> 22:47.767
SCRUBBING IN WITH OWEN,

22:47.767 --> 22:49.999
WHO WANTS TO SIGN
OUR DIVORCE PAPERS TODAY.

22:49.999 --> 22:53.843
I GUESS WE'RE BEING
MATURE AND MOVING ON.

22:53.843 --> 22:56.075
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME

22:56.075 --> 22:59.148
THAT THE DIVORCE WAS BECAUSE
OF THE PLANE CRASH LAWSUIT?

22:59.148 --> 23:00.880
WHAT?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.612
DEREK TOLD ME, SO THAT
THE CASE IS STRONGER.

23:02.612 --> 23:03.953
WHICH IS GREAT, I'M GLAD,

23:03.953 --> 23:04.914
ESPECIALLY IF IT MEANS

23:04.914 --> 23:06.556
THE TWO OF YOU
ARE GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

23:06.556 --> 23:07.857
IT'S GOOD NEWS,
AND I DON'T KNOW

23:07.857 --> 23:09.819
WHY YOU WOULDN'T WANT
TO SHARE THAT WITH ME?

23:09.819 --> 23:11.561
BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW.

23:11.561 --> 23:14.964
(sighs) YOU READY?

23:16.496 --> 23:17.797
WHAT?

23:30.940 --> 23:32.111
DR. SHEPHERD'S PREPPED?

23:32.111 --> 23:33.483
YEP.

23:33.483 --> 23:35.685
UH, DR. TORRES IS GOING OVER
THE STUDIES.

23:35.685 --> 23:36.846
OKAY.

23:36.846 --> 23:38.648
YEAH.

23:38.648 --> 23:40.149
HOLD IT TOGETHER.

23:40.149 --> 23:43.593
WELL, A NERVE EXTRACTION'S
A PRETTY SIMPLE PROCEDURE.

23:43.593 --> 23:44.724
NOT THAT.

23:44.724 --> 23:47.497
HE ASKED ME ON A DATE,
TO DR. BAILEY'S WEDDING.

23:47.497 --> 23:49.799
DR. KEPNER ASKED ME.

23:49.799 --> 23:51.100
IT'S A DATE?

23:51.100 --> 23:52.862
IT'S NOT, LIKE,
A MENTORING THING?

23:52.862 --> 23:54.003
HOW IS DRINKING CHAMPAGNE

23:54.003 --> 23:56.435
AND DANCING TO BARRY WHITE
A MENTORING THING?

23:56.435 --> 23:57.607
I THOUGHT IT WAS, LIKE,

23:57.607 --> 23:58.908
SPENDING TIME
GETTING TO KNOW THE INTERNS

23:58.908 --> 24:01.040
IN A CASUAL,
STRESS-FREE ENVIRONMENT.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.613
THAT WAS THE FREE-DOUGHNUTS
THING IN THE LOUNGE.
(elevator bell dings)

24:03.613 --> 24:04.744
THIS IS A WEDDING.

24:04.744 --> 24:06.445
(groans) I CAN'T
GO ON A DATE WITH MY BOSS.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.777
I NEED TO FOCUS ON MY WORK,

24:07.777 --> 24:09.579
NOT GET ALL WRAPPED UP
IN THE LADIES.

24:09.579 --> 24:11.220
DID YOU REALLY JUST SAY
"THE LADIES"?

24:11.220 --> 24:12.582
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO JUST SAID

24:12.582 --> 24:14.053
YOU COULDN'T CONCENTRATE
IN THE O.R.

24:14.053 --> 24:15.585
'CAUSE DR. AVERY MIGHT LOOK AT
YOU WITH HIS LIMPID GREEN EYES.

24:15.585 --> 24:16.986
THE EYES ARE REALLY INTENSE.

24:16.986 --> 24:18.728
YOU'VE NOTICED IT YOURSELF,
RIGHT?

24:18.728 --> 24:19.889
GET A GRIP.

24:19.889 --> 24:21.691
YOU GET A GRIP.

24:21.691 --> 24:23.162
KAREV, DID YOU TELL WILSON

24:23.162 --> 24:25.535
THAT SHE'D BE FIRED FOR
SCREWING UP A GASTRIC IMPLANT?
WHAT?

24:25.535 --> 24:26.866
IS THE PATIENT GONNA MAKE IT?

24:26.866 --> 24:28.868
THE PATIENT'S FINE.
WHAT THE HELL DID SHE TELL YOU?

24:28.868 --> 24:30.940
SHE THINKS THAT YOU SET HER UP
TO TAKE THE FALL

24:30.940 --> 24:31.901
ON A RISKY O.R. PROCEDURE,

24:31.901 --> 24:33.072
AND IT KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE
YOU DID.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.874
IT WOULD'VE BEEN RISKY
NO MATTER WHO DID IT.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.005
AND I WAS STANDING RIGHT THERE.

24:36.005 --> 24:37.807
THE SECOND IT GOT HAIRY,
I TOOK OVER.

24:37.807 --> 24:38.878
SHE WAS IN OVER HER HEAD.

24:38.878 --> 24:40.209
AND WHERE DO YOU THINK
I GOT THE IDEA

24:40.209 --> 24:41.581
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

24:41.581 --> 24:42.752
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

24:42.752 --> 24:44.784
YOU. I'M TRYING TO BE
LIKE YOU WERE WITH ME.

24:44.784 --> 24:47.016
YOU LET ME TRY CRAP
SO I GOT CONFIDENCE IN MYSELF.

24:47.016 --> 24:48.858
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO--
NOT TREAT THE STUPID MORONS

24:48.858 --> 24:50.920
LIKE THE STUPID MORONS
THAT I THINK THEY ARE.

24:50.920 --> 24:53.693
I GAVE YOU OPPORTUNITIES.

24:53.693 --> 24:55.965
I ALSO GAVE YOU A BOATLOAD OF
ENCOURAGEMENT AND SUPPORT.

24:55.965 --> 24:58.267
I DIDN'T DROP-KICK YOU INTO
THE DEEP END OF THE POOL...

24:58.267 --> 25:00.029
(lowered voice)
AND YELL, "SWIM, IDIOT."

25:00.029 --> 25:01.731
YOU'RE A TEACHER NOW.

25:01.731 --> 25:04.934
YOUR STUDENTS FAIL,
YOU'VE FAILED.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.812
(sighs)

25:12.812 --> 25:13.883
(groans)

25:13.883 --> 25:15.685
(chart thuds)
OH!

25:15.685 --> 25:17.146
GLAD YOU'RE DRIVING
YOURSELF TO THE WEDDING.

25:17.146 --> 25:19.018
REMIND ME
TO STAY OFF THE ROADS.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.790
(sighs)

25:20.790 --> 25:22.792
WERE YOU LIKE THIS?

25:23.993 --> 25:25.955
ON MY WEDDING DAY,

25:25.955 --> 25:30.299
I REMEMBER STARING AT MY SOCKS
FOR A LONG TIME.

25:30.299 --> 25:33.102
I HAD NO IDEA
WHAT TO DO WITH 'EM.

25:33.102 --> 25:35.104
YOU KNOW,
TEN YEARS FROM NOW,

25:35.104 --> 25:37.006
IF THE MARRIAGE IS STRONG,

25:37.006 --> 25:40.740
I'LL LOOK BACK AT TODAY
AND SAY...

25:40.740 --> 25:43.312
"IT WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT
OF COLD FEET."

25:43.312 --> 25:48.778
IF WE'RE IN A NASTY DIVORCE,
I'LL SAY,

25:48.778 --> 25:51.250
"I KNEW IT WAS A MISTAKE
THE DAY WE GOT MARRIED."

25:53.753 --> 25:55.184
YOU THINK IT'S A MISTAKE?

25:55.184 --> 25:57.927
I JUST FEEL...

25:57.927 --> 25:59.558
WORRIED.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.591
I NEVER FELT THAT WAY
WITH TUCKER.

26:03.933 --> 26:06.966
YOU WERE A CHILD
WHEN YOU MARRIED TUCKER.

26:06.966 --> 26:08.267
YOU'RE AN ADULT NOW.

26:08.267 --> 26:11.601
YOU KNOW THE WORLD'S
AN AMBIGUOUS PLACE.

26:11.601 --> 26:14.303
YOU KNOW THAT LOVE
DOESN'T CONQUER ALL.

26:14.303 --> 26:16.005
IT CONQUERS SOME STUFF.

26:16.005 --> 26:19.649
THE OTHER STUFF KICKS
THE LIVING CRAP OUT OF LOVE.

26:19.649 --> 26:21.981
AND THIS IS THE PEP TALK?

26:21.981 --> 26:24.313
(chuckles)

26:24.313 --> 26:27.687
OVERWHELMING DOUBT
IS A PROBLEM.

26:27.687 --> 26:29.659
A LITTLE BIT OF DOUBT

26:29.659 --> 26:32.121
IS JUST A SIGN
OF AN INTELLIGENT ADULT.

26:34.994 --> 26:36.666
IS GREY GONNA BE
IN THE GALLERY?

26:36.666 --> 26:39.098
NO. SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO MAKE YOU NERVOUS.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.269
(Callie chuckles)

26:40.269 --> 26:41.731
I TOLD HER
YOU DON'T GET NERVOUS.

26:41.731 --> 26:43.272
YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T.

26:44.674 --> 26:45.905
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

26:45.905 --> 26:47.637
ENJOY YOUR NAP.

26:47.637 --> 26:49.709
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.
MM.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.911
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

26:51.911 --> 26:53.112
TORRES.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.884
HMM?

26:54.884 --> 26:58.087
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

26:58.087 --> 27:01.050
(laughs)

27:03.022 --> 27:04.293
(hisses)

27:07.927 --> 27:09.228
(exhales)

27:09.228 --> 27:11.030
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

27:11.030 --> 27:12.161
WE GOOD TO GO?

27:12.161 --> 27:13.933
YES, WE ARE.

27:13.933 --> 27:15.064
YES. WE'RE--YES.

27:15.064 --> 27:16.836
(Meredith) Jackson,
I just want to let you know,

27:16.836 --> 27:18.137
I'll be here watching
the whole time.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.238
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.

27:19.238 --> 27:20.409
No mistakes.

27:20.409 --> 27:21.811
THAT'S THE PLAN.

27:21.811 --> 27:22.912
OKAY.

27:22.912 --> 27:24.113
(clattering)

27:24.113 --> 27:25.214
Are you kidding me?

27:25.214 --> 27:28.117
GET THAT WOMAN
OUT OF MY GALLERY.

27:28.117 --> 27:29.819
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.
GET HER OUT.

27:29.819 --> 27:31.951
I heard that, Avery. Edwards,
don't even think about it.

27:31.951 --> 27:34.123
(beeping continues)

27:34.123 --> 27:36.025
NOW.

27:36.025 --> 27:37.656
Edwards, you wouldn't dare.

27:37.656 --> 27:38.988
You have years with me.

27:38.988 --> 27:41.090
I can be very difficult
to deal with.

27:41.090 --> 27:42.862
15-BLADE, PLEASE.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.333
(Alex) YOU NARCED ON ME
TO MY BOSS?

27:44.333 --> 27:45.865
I WORKED HARD TO GET HERE.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.436
I'M NOT GONNA LET MYSELF
GET FIRED BECAUSE--

27:47.436 --> 27:49.298
NOBODY'S FIRING YOU.

27:49.298 --> 27:51.000
I WAS TRYING TO HELP YOU.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.042
I CLEARLY WASN'T READY
FOR IT.

27:53.042 --> 27:54.874
WHY, BECAUSE I HAD TO
TAKE OVER?

27:54.874 --> 27:56.345
LOOK, YOU CAN'T GO CRYING
TO MY DAMN BOSS

27:56.345 --> 27:58.077
EVERY TIME YOU GET SCARED.

27:58.077 --> 27:59.378
YOU CAN'T CRY AT ALL
WHEN YOU GET SCARED

27:59.378 --> 28:01.250
BECAUSE IT'S SCARY IN THERE
ALL THE TIME.

28:01.250 --> 28:03.783
I JUST THOUGHT,
MAYBE AFTER I BLEW THE APPY,

28:03.783 --> 28:05.114
I'D BE A GOOD TARGET

28:05.114 --> 28:06.415
IF YOU NEEDED TO PIN SOMETHING
ON SOMEONE.

28:06.415 --> 28:08.387
IT'S PARANOID. I GET THAT.

28:08.387 --> 28:10.059
I DON'T ALWAYS TRUST PEOPLE
WHO ARE TRYING TO HELP ME.

28:10.059 --> 28:11.390
YEAH, YEAH,
YOU'RE A BEATEN DOG

28:11.390 --> 28:13.192
AND YOU BITE PEOPLE
WHO TRY TO FEED YOU.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.324
I DON'T GIVE A CRAP
ABOUT YOUR SAD STORY.

28:15.324 --> 28:18.167
YOU WANT TO BE A SURGEON, YOU
NEED TO GET THE HELL OVER IT.

28:18.167 --> 28:19.328
YOU BURNED A BRIDGE WITH ME.

28:19.328 --> 28:20.870
HOW ABOUT YOU GROW UP
BEFORE YOU BURN A BRIDGE

28:20.870 --> 28:22.001
WITH EVERY OTHER ATTENDING

28:22.001 --> 28:24.133
WHO TRIES
TO TEACH YOU SOMETHING?

28:27.106 --> 28:30.379
50 CENTIMETERS
OF PRIME NERVE.

28:30.379 --> 28:32.411
GREAT.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.744
ALL RIGHT.

28:34.744 --> 28:37.216
FORCEPS, PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.218
OKAY.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.920
IS NO ONE MAKING SMALL TALK

28:40.920 --> 28:42.952
BECAUSE THIS IS DEREK SHEPHERD
ON THE TABLE?

28:42.952 --> 28:44.123
THIS IS INTRICATE WORK.

28:44.123 --> 28:46.055
SMALL TALK
IS WHAT KEEPS US AWAKE.

28:46.055 --> 28:48.427
WELL, UH...
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO,

28:48.427 --> 28:51.460
I HELPED DR. KEPNER
EXTRACT A MALIGNANT MASS

28:51.460 --> 28:54.463
FROM THE GLUTEAL AREA
OF A FEMALE PATIENT.

28:54.463 --> 28:56.105
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

28:56.105 --> 29:00.469
IT--IT WAS
AN IMPRESSIVELY SIZED MASS.

29:00.469 --> 29:03.142
WHO'S GONNA TELL DR. SHEPHERD
THAT HE'LL NEVER OPERATE AGAIN

29:03.142 --> 29:06.045
BECAUSE ROSS' IDEA OF GOSSIP IS,

29:06.045 --> 29:09.178
HE SAW APRIL KEPNER
TAKE A LUMP OFF AN ASS?

29:09.178 --> 29:11.180
(beeping continues)

29:11.180 --> 29:13.082
(instruments clink)

29:13.082 --> 29:15.224
BROOKS, SUCTION.

29:15.224 --> 29:16.826
(suction gurgles)

29:16.826 --> 29:19.188
ALL OF, NOT HALF OF IT.

29:19.188 --> 29:20.529
SORRY.

29:20.529 --> 29:23.963
(gurgling)

29:23.963 --> 29:26.065
HE'S GOT A BUNCH
OF TATTOOS.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.466
WONDER IF IT'S SOME SORT
OF A GANG THING.

29:27.466 --> 29:29.468
I HAD--
THE CHATTER ISN'T HELPING ME,

29:29.468 --> 29:31.200
AND YOUR EXPERIENCE
WITH GANGLAND YOUTH

29:31.200 --> 29:33.202
HAS LITTLE BEARING
ON HOW WE TREAT THIS PATIENT.

29:33.202 --> 29:36.205
(gurgling continues)

29:40.549 --> 29:41.911
(turns water off)

29:41.911 --> 29:43.252
(pedal clanks)

29:45.484 --> 29:47.016
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

29:47.016 --> 29:48.357
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE AMICABLE.

29:48.357 --> 29:51.190
WE'RE GETTING DIVORCED
BECAUSE OF THE LAWSUIT?

29:52.391 --> 29:54.193
IT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY
INCREASE YOUR CHANCES--

29:54.193 --> 29:55.364
YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO MENTION IT?

29:55.364 --> 29:56.525
I WANT YOU TO GET THE MONEY.

29:56.525 --> 29:58.227
I WANT ALL OF YOU
TO GET THE MONEY,

29:58.227 --> 29:59.368
AND I KNEW THERE WAS
A VERY REAL CHANCE

29:59.368 --> 30:00.900
THAT YOU WOULD REJECT THE IDEA

30:00.900 --> 30:02.231
SIMPLY BECAUSE
I SUGGESTED IT.

30:02.231 --> 30:04.503
OH, RIGHT. BECAUSE I'M
SO SIMPLE-MINDED AND PETULANT.

30:04.503 --> 30:05.875
YOU'VE BEEN KNOWN TO--

30:05.875 --> 30:07.176
WHERE DO YOU GET OFF

30:07.176 --> 30:09.108
MAKING SOME KIND OF UNILATERAL
DECISION ABOUT OUR MARRIAGE?

30:09.108 --> 30:10.439
HOW ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU
MOVED ACROSS THE COUNTRY

30:10.439 --> 30:11.981
AND DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE
TO DO WHAT I DID

30:11.981 --> 30:14.113
AND SIMPLY ASK
FOR A DIVORCE?

30:14.113 --> 30:15.945
(laughs) OH, GOD.
SO THIS IS BALLSY,

30:15.945 --> 30:17.516
YOU HIDING BEHIND
THE LAWSUIT?

30:17.516 --> 30:19.048
YOU COULDN'T JUST
ADMIT TO ME,

30:19.048 --> 30:20.890
OR--OR--OR GOD SAKE, YOURSELF,
THAT YOU WANTED OUT.

30:20.890 --> 30:22.051
YOU HAVE TO LET
THIS STUPID PLANE CRASH

30:22.051 --> 30:23.222
MAKE THE DECISION FOR YOU.

30:23.222 --> 30:24.293
I CHOSE THE AIRLINE!

30:24.293 --> 30:26.195
YOU LIKE IT BETTER
WHEN I DECIDE?!

30:26.195 --> 30:28.397
I CHOSE THE AIRLINE!

30:34.303 --> 30:36.135
(sighs)

30:37.907 --> 30:41.010
WE HAD TO MAKE A BUDGET CUT
OF 4%...

30:41.010 --> 30:43.913
AND WE HAD A LINE ITEM
OF EMERGENCY TRANSPORTATION.

30:43.913 --> 30:46.275
WE NEVER USED IT,
AND WE HAD A...

30:46.275 --> 30:48.147
FANCY CHARTER COMPANY,

30:48.147 --> 30:54.183
AND I CHOSE
A... CHEAPER ONE.

30:56.055 --> 30:58.057
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY
IT WAS CHEAPER?

30:58.057 --> 30:59.358
YOU DIDN'T BUILD THE PLANE.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.160
PEOPLE ARE DEAD.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.491
OR FLY IT.

31:02.491 --> 31:06.265
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD.

31:11.040 --> 31:13.302
YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE.

31:13.302 --> 31:15.204
(exhales)

31:15.204 --> 31:17.246
SOMEONE HAS TO BE.

31:18.978 --> 31:21.310
I MEAN, IT TAKES
A LOT OF SMALL MISTAKES

31:21.310 --> 31:22.651
TO DESTROY SOMETHING,

31:22.651 --> 31:24.313
AND IT'S REALLY EASY
FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED

31:24.313 --> 31:28.017
JUST TO SAY, "AH, I JUST DID
THIS ONE SMALL THING."

31:32.922 --> 31:36.325
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
MADE IT POSSIBLE...

31:36.325 --> 31:38.897
FOR A BAD PLANE
TO TAKE OFF

31:38.897 --> 31:41.230
WITH YOU, MEREDITH, AND DEREK,

31:41.230 --> 31:44.003
AND ARIZONA, AND...

31:47.676 --> 31:50.609
AND I AM
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.

31:59.018 --> 32:01.320
(door closes)
