00:15.738 --> 00:17.205
Okay, help me out here.

00:17.206 --> 00:20.842
How does an archeology professor
get that good with a whip?

00:20.843 --> 00:23.411
Maybe he took a class
at the adult bookstore.

00:23.412 --> 00:25.046
That's how I learned.

00:25.047 --> 00:27.849
I can't believe you've never
seen <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark.</i>

00:27.850 --> 00:31.653
And I can't believe you've
never read <i>Eat, Pray, Love.</i>

00:31.654 --> 00:33.121
When she comes out with

00:33.122 --> 00:35.857
<i>Eat, Pray, Run Away From A</i>
<i>Giant Boulder,</i> I'll read it.

00:37.360 --> 00:40.862
I don't care if <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>
changed your life,

00:40.863 --> 00:43.798
I'm not reading it.

00:43.799 --> 00:46.067
You know, I could totally
rock a hat like that.

00:46.068 --> 00:48.803
That's the work of noted
Hollywood costume designer

00:48.804 --> 00:49.904
Deborah Nadoolman.

00:49.905 --> 00:51.239
She also designed

00:51.240 --> 00:52.574
the iconic red and black jacket

00:52.575 --> 00:54.442
in Michael Jackson's
<i>Thriller</i> video,

00:54.443 --> 00:56.411
which I've never viewed
in its entirety,

00:56.412 --> 00:57.796
as I find zombies dancing

00:57.797 --> 00:59.981
in choreographed synchronicity
implausible.

01:01.217 --> 01:04.586
And also, it's really scary.

01:04.587 --> 01:07.722
Would someone please turn off
the Sheldon commentary track?

01:07.723 --> 01:11.659
There's no switch.
Just listen and learn.

01:12.461 --> 01:14.062
Penny, if you think
this is good,

01:14.063 --> 01:15.263
you should come with us Friday

01:15.264 --> 01:17.399
to see it on the big screen
at the Colonial.

01:17.400 --> 01:18.466
Well, I'm watching it now.

01:18.467 --> 01:19.968
Why would I want to see it again
on Friday?

01:19.969 --> 01:21.903
Because the print
they're showing on Friday

01:21.904 --> 01:26.191
has an additional 21 seconds
of previously unseen footage.

01:26.192 --> 01:30.879
21 seconds? That'll be like
seeing a whole new movie!

01:30.880 --> 01:32.113
Exactly.

01:32.114 --> 01:33.948
They say it finally solves
the submarine controversy.

01:33.949 --> 01:35.984
Did-- Leonard?

01:35.985 --> 01:37.585
I'm no expert, but I believe

01:37.586 --> 01:39.504
what we just heard from Penny
was sarcasm.

01:40.856 --> 01:42.757
Oh! Good.

01:42.758 --> 01:44.426
I'm eight for 26 this month.

01:45.995 --> 01:47.061
Yeah, I think I'll pass.

01:47.062 --> 01:49.931
But you guys enjoy
your extra 21 seconds.

01:49.932 --> 01:51.399
Bet if I could
make you understand

01:51.400 --> 01:53.735
why this is such a cool thing,
we'd still be together.

01:53.736 --> 01:57.238
Mm, yeah, no,
we wouldn't.

01:57.239 --> 01:58.640
Uh-huh.

01:58.641 --> 02:02.744
I'm guessing 21 seconds had
something to do with that, too.

02:33.461 --> 02:34.928
May I point out to you all

02:34.929 --> 02:37.297
that the screening is
"first come, first served"?

02:37.298 --> 02:40.867
Relax, it's 5:00. The movie
doesn't start till midnight.

02:40.868 --> 02:43.237
Another way of saying that is

02:43.238 --> 02:45.372
"the movie starts at midnight,
and it's already 5:00."

02:45.373 --> 02:46.640
Let's go.

02:46.641 --> 02:48.875
You know, if we miss it,
we'll have the fun of

02:48.876 --> 02:52.229
listening to Sheldon whine about
it for the rest of our lives.

02:52.230 --> 02:55.082
See? Howard's on my side.

02:55.083 --> 02:56.717
Actually, I'm not.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.719
I'm using sarcasm to mock you.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.573
Drat. Now I'm 8 for 27.

03:02.574 --> 03:04.541
Don't worry, Sheldon.
We'll be fine.

03:04.542 --> 03:06.493
What happened to
the Leonard Hofstadter

03:06.494 --> 03:08.862
who waited in line
with me for 14 hours

03:08.863 --> 03:11.197
to see the midnight premiere
of <i>Star Trek: Nemesis?</i>

03:11.198 --> 03:13.967
Oh. Well, he waited
in line for 14 hours,

03:13.968 --> 03:15.569
while you napped
in a lawn chair,

03:15.570 --> 03:17.237
he got in a fight
with a Klingon

03:17.238 --> 03:18.939
when he stepped
out of line to pee

03:18.940 --> 03:20.707
and you wouldn't wake up
to vouch for him,

03:20.708 --> 03:24.144
and worst of all,
he saw <i>Star Trek: Nemesis.</i>

03:24.145 --> 03:26.280
But how were our seats?

03:26.281 --> 03:27.347
Excellent.

03:27.348 --> 03:28.982
I rest my case.

03:28.983 --> 03:32.252
Amy, don't you agree we should
leave now and get in line?

03:33.688 --> 03:36.156
Actually, as the newest member
of your social group,

03:36.157 --> 03:38.292
I believe I'll gain more
acceptance by arbitrarily

03:38.293 --> 03:40.661
siding with your friends
from time to time.

03:40.662 --> 03:43.664
Shrewd.

03:43.665 --> 03:46.133
Leonard, you're right.

03:46.134 --> 03:48.168
We should enjoy our meal,
arrive late,

03:48.169 --> 03:49.870
and risk winding up
with terrible seats,

03:49.871 --> 03:51.972
assuming we get in at all.

03:51.973 --> 03:53.674
Thank you, Amy.

03:53.675 --> 03:57.177
See? It's working.

03:57.178 --> 03:59.212
Knock-knock.

03:59.213 --> 04:00.263
Who's there?

04:00.264 --> 04:01.281
Olive.

04:01.282 --> 04:04.250
Olive you, too.

04:04.251 --> 04:06.653
Guys, that's really
starting to get old.

04:06.654 --> 04:07.771
Knock-knock.

04:07.772 --> 04:08.822
Who's there?

04:08.823 --> 04:11.658
I have a girlfriend
and you don't.

04:11.659 --> 04:13.777
Hysterical!

04:13.778 --> 04:15.896
Wait, now, we don't know
that yet. He isn't finished.

04:15.897 --> 04:18.765
I have a girlfriend
and you don't <i>who?</i>

04:18.766 --> 04:22.903
So. Are you sure you don't want
to come with us to <i>Raiders?</i>

04:22.904 --> 04:25.906
Oh, no. That movie
has melting faces.

04:25.907 --> 04:27.541
It reminds me
too much of the time

04:27.542 --> 04:29.643
I dropped that vial of
flesh-eating bacteria

04:29.644 --> 04:31.144
into the Rhesus monkey lab.

04:33.681 --> 04:35.982
Besides, Penny and I are having
a girls' night tonight.

04:35.983 --> 04:38.151
Girls' night?
What does that entail?

04:38.152 --> 04:39.786
Oh, you know, girls get
together,

04:39.787 --> 04:41.521
hang out, share girl talk.

04:42.357 --> 04:44.358
I'm a girl.

04:44.359 --> 04:48.895
Oh. Well, maybe you can join us.
I'll ask Penny.

04:48.896 --> 04:51.848
No need. Penny and I
are very close.

04:51.849 --> 04:53.500
You are?

04:53.501 --> 04:56.203
Yes. In fact,
our menses are synchronized.

05:01.442 --> 05:03.160
Penny.

05:03.161 --> 05:05.045
Bernadette tells me you're
planning a girls' night.

05:05.046 --> 05:06.079
Yeah?

05:06.080 --> 05:08.949
I'm a girl.

05:08.950 --> 05:11.618
Oh. Um, it was-- it was just
going to be me and Bernadette.

05:11.619 --> 05:13.520
Besides, I thought you
were going to the movies

05:13.521 --> 05:14.621
with Sheldon and the guys.

05:14.622 --> 05:16.022
Yes, but they're not girls.

05:16.023 --> 05:18.058
I'm a girl.

05:18.059 --> 05:22.295
Yeah, no, no,
I-I-I got that.

05:22.296 --> 05:23.663
What's the dress code?

05:23.664 --> 05:25.665
Uh, just wear something
comfortable.

05:25.666 --> 05:29.636
All right.
I'll have to go shopping.

05:30.571 --> 05:32.472
Knock-knock.

05:32.473 --> 05:33.507
Who is there?

05:33.508 --> 05:35.075
Hugh.
Hugh who?

05:35.076 --> 05:38.044
Hugh people need to
listen to me.

05:42.116 --> 05:45.518
It's time to get
in line for the movie.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.370
And that's how you tell
a knock-knock joke.

05:50.908 --> 05:56.696
Under normal circumstances
I'd say, "I told you so."

05:56.697 --> 05:58.865
But as I have told you so

05:58.866 --> 06:00.634
with such vehemence
and frequency already,

06:00.635 --> 06:03.470
the phrase has lost all meaning.

06:03.471 --> 06:06.139
Therefore, I will be
replacing it with the phrase:

06:06.140 --> 06:08.425
"I informed you thusly."

06:08.426 --> 06:11.311
Ooh. Can't wait
for that to start.

06:11.312 --> 06:13.563
I informed you thusly.

06:13.564 --> 06:17.150
Eight for 28.

06:17.151 --> 06:20.937
This is where we could have been
if we hadn't stopped for dinner.

06:20.938 --> 06:23.106
This is where we could have been

06:23.107 --> 06:25.425
if Koothrappali
hadn't ordered dessert.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.577
Well I earned it, dude,
I ate all my broccoli.

06:27.578 --> 06:32.749
And here's where we are.
The runts in a large litter.

06:32.750 --> 06:34.367
unlikely to ever reach

06:34.368 --> 06:38.438
the nourishing teats
of Indiana Jones.

06:38.439 --> 06:41.541
So I guess it's a good thing
we stopped for dinner.

06:43.711 --> 06:46.296
You know, guys, when
facing disappointment,

06:46.297 --> 06:47.580
<i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>  teaches us--

06:47.581 --> 06:50.300
Oh, shut up.

06:51.486 --> 06:53.820
...so anyway, to make
a long story short,

06:53.821 --> 06:57.557
turns out I have
an unusually firm cervix.

06:59.594 --> 07:02.762
You--
Amy, when we say "girl talk,"

07:02.763 --> 07:06.600
it doesn't just have to
be about our lady parts.

07:06.601 --> 07:11.638
Shame. 'Cause I have a real
zinger about my titled uterus.

07:15.776 --> 07:18.612
Penny, your nails
look great.

07:18.613 --> 07:21.915
Oh, thanks. I found
this place in Alhambra.

07:21.916 --> 07:23.283
It's in a woman's basement.

07:23.284 --> 07:25.685
I think it's a front
for human trafficking,

07:25.686 --> 07:27.787
but they do a really good job.

07:29.190 --> 07:31.591
A colleague of mine did her
graduate thesis on the fungus

07:31.592 --> 07:34.227
that grows on improperly
sterilized manicure implements.

07:35.496 --> 07:38.365
Well don't tell me
that's not "girl talk."

07:38.366 --> 07:41.318
So where should
we go tonight?

07:41.319 --> 07:43.503
A bar? A club? A movie?

07:43.504 --> 07:45.171
Or we could just stay here.

07:45.172 --> 07:46.740
Yes, and continue to bond.

07:46.741 --> 07:48.475
I have a feeling
that after tonight,

07:48.476 --> 07:51.011
one of you will become
my best friend forever.

07:51.012 --> 07:54.014
Or "BFF," if you prefer.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.348
Which I don't.

07:55.349 --> 07:59.586
All right, time to open
Bachelor Number Two.

07:59.587 --> 08:01.955
Gee, I don't know
if I should drink more.

08:01.956 --> 08:04.124
I have to drive home,
and I've got enough trouble

08:04.125 --> 08:06.960
seeing over the dashboard
as it is.

08:06.961 --> 08:10.263
That's okay.
You can just sleep here.

08:10.264 --> 08:12.566
Oh, good, a slumber party!

08:12.567 --> 08:14.935
We'll do makeovers,
initiate phony phone calls,

08:14.936 --> 08:17.971
and have spirited pillow fights
in our frilly nighties!

08:17.972 --> 08:19.506
Oh, gosh, Amy.

08:19.507 --> 08:21.975
I don't know if I would call
this an actual slumber party.

08:21.976 --> 08:23.276
Well, that's disappointing.

08:23.277 --> 08:25.078
I've always wanted to be
invited to a slumber party.

08:25.079 --> 08:26.546
Oh, you never were?

08:26.547 --> 08:28.014
Not even when
you were a kid?

08:28.015 --> 08:30.550
Well, there was the time
I had my tonsils out,

08:30.551 --> 08:33.285
and I shared a room with
a little Vietnamese girl.

08:34.455 --> 08:35.822
She didn't make it
through the night,

08:35.823 --> 08:37.991
but up till then,
it was kind of fun.

08:40.628 --> 08:43.630
Okay. Well, I guess we're
having a slumber party.

08:43.631 --> 08:44.998
Oh!

08:46.300 --> 08:48.902
Pillow fight!

08:51.572 --> 08:54.240
Oh, I hope they
let us in soon.

08:54.241 --> 08:56.676
I'm tired of running to the gas
station to use the bathroom.

08:56.677 --> 08:59.980
The guy makes me buy
a Gatorade every time.

08:59.981 --> 09:01.281
It's a vicious circle.

09:01.282 --> 09:05.352
Too bad you don't have
a stadium pal like me.

09:05.353 --> 09:06.720
What's a stadium pal?

09:06.721 --> 09:08.254
Let me put it this way:

09:08.255 --> 09:10.123
takes care of
the bathroom problem,

09:10.124 --> 09:11.858
and it keeps your calf warm.

09:13.060 --> 09:16.129
Hey, guys, bad news.
I just did a quick calculation.

09:16.130 --> 09:18.698
Given the size of the theater
and the length of this line,

09:18.699 --> 09:20.600
we might not get seats.

09:21.502 --> 09:23.737
What did he say?

09:23.738 --> 09:24.938
Nice going, Raj.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.940
Just got him down for his nap.

09:28.242 --> 09:30.243
We might not get seats?!

09:30.244 --> 09:31.577
It's fine, it's fine.
Go back to sleep.

09:31.578 --> 09:35.298
Oh, I informed you thusly!
I so informed you thusly.

09:35.299 --> 09:38.018
Howard, you talk to him.

09:38.019 --> 09:39.185
Howard?

09:41.389 --> 09:43.023
You're peeing,
aren't you?

09:44.992 --> 09:46.292
Hey, look who's here!

09:46.293 --> 09:48.061
Hey, buddies!

09:48.062 --> 09:49.479
Well, if it isn't Wil Wheaton,

09:49.480 --> 09:53.600
the Jar Jar Binks
of the <i>Star Trek</i> universe.

09:53.601 --> 09:57.337
Mee-sa think that very funny!

09:57.338 --> 10:01.174
Well, you-sa can go think that
at the back of the line.

10:01.175 --> 10:03.743
No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.

10:04.779 --> 10:05.795
Wil Wheaton.

10:05.796 --> 10:06.830
Yeah.

10:06.831 --> 10:07.797
I'm a big fan.

10:07.798 --> 10:11.451
Of what? Poorly
executed beards?

10:11.452 --> 10:13.520
Do you think you could get me
and my friends into the movie?

10:13.521 --> 10:14.788
We got here
a little late.

10:14.789 --> 10:16.622
No problem. Come on,
I'll hook you up.

10:16.623 --> 10:17.807
Awesome.

10:19.126 --> 10:22.595
We-sa gonna go into
the movie now! Bye-bye!

10:24.648 --> 10:28.768
This is <i>Indiana</i> Jones,
not <i>Star Trek.</i>

10:28.769 --> 10:32.105
There should be no value
to his pseudo-celebrity here!

10:32.106 --> 10:33.873
And even at
Star Trek conventions,

10:33.874 --> 10:36.676
they only let him in
if he helps set up!

10:36.677 --> 10:38.344
Calm down, Sheldon.

10:38.345 --> 10:39.779
I will not calm down.

10:39.780 --> 10:42.782
This affront to justice and
decency cannot go unanswered.

10:42.783 --> 10:45.618
As Captain Jean-Luc Picard
once said,

10:45.619 --> 10:48.705
"The line must be drawn here!

10:48.706 --> 10:52.792
"This far, no farther!"

10:52.793 --> 10:56.429
Had to wake him up
from his nap, didn't you?

10:59.552 --> 11:01.653
You know what I really love
about Howard?

11:01.654 --> 11:03.638
His chest hair.

11:04.974 --> 11:07.108
Howard has a
hairy chest?

11:07.109 --> 11:09.311
No, just the one.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.747
But it's really long.

11:14.534 --> 11:17.786
Okay, there you go--
Sultry Sunrise Red.

11:17.787 --> 11:19.387
What do you think?

11:19.388 --> 11:22.157
My nails have never
looked so pretty before.

11:22.158 --> 11:24.326
Get it off.

11:26.529 --> 11:28.146
Oh, oh, uh, looks like
they're getting ready

11:28.147 --> 11:29.381
to let people in.

11:29.382 --> 11:32.434
Listen to what Mr. Wil
Wheaton is tweeting.

11:32.435 --> 11:36.304
"Best seats in house
for <i>Raiders</i> screening.

11:36.305 --> 11:39.441
Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper."

11:39.442 --> 11:41.209
Why do you read
his Twitter feed?

11:41.210 --> 11:43.061
You know it's only
going to upset you.

11:43.062 --> 11:45.413
I believe in knowing
my enemy, Leonard.

11:45.414 --> 11:48.767
Had Twitter existed at the time,
would not General Custer

11:48.768 --> 11:51.052
have followed the tweets
of Sitting Bull?

11:51.053 --> 11:53.488
Would not Lee have
followed Grant?

11:53.489 --> 11:56.057
Would not Spy have followed Spy?

11:57.460 --> 11:59.728
I have more examples,
but excuse me.

11:59.729 --> 12:01.396
Hello.

12:01.397 --> 12:03.798
Well, this seems
like an odd time

12:03.799 --> 12:07.369
to test my cell phone quality,
but go on.

12:07.370 --> 12:09.804
Test phrases? All right.

12:10.606 --> 12:12.541
Imatote.

12:12.542 --> 12:14.576
Ulba.

12:14.577 --> 12:16.344
Twad.

12:17.213 --> 12:18.914
All together?

12:18.915 --> 12:21.383
I'm a total buttwad.

12:23.719 --> 12:25.887
Why are you laughing?

12:27.123 --> 12:29.157
Hello?

12:29.158 --> 12:32.027
And that, girls, is how you make
a phony phone call.

12:33.729 --> 12:34.963
I'm not sure I grasp

12:34.964 --> 12:37.566
the full entertainment value,
but all right.

12:38.701 --> 12:41.002
Next on Wikipedia's list
of slumber party activities:

12:41.003 --> 12:42.287
"Truth or Dare."

12:42.288 --> 12:43.939
Okay, it's your game.
You go first.

12:43.940 --> 12:47.409
Hang on. I'm familiarizing
myself with the rules.

12:47.410 --> 12:50.111
Seems fairly straightforward.

12:50.112 --> 12:52.380
Bernadette, truth or dare?

12:52.381 --> 12:53.949
Truth.
All right.

12:53.950 --> 12:56.451
To what temperature
must you heat beef

12:56.452 --> 12:58.053
in order to
kill the prion

12:58.054 --> 13:00.689
that causes bovine
spongiform encephalopathy?

13:00.690 --> 13:02.324
Um...

13:02.325 --> 13:05.026
Remember, you have
to answer honestly.

13:05.027 --> 13:07.295
Wait. No, Amy, you're
supposed to ask her

13:07.296 --> 13:08.697
something personal
or embarrassing.

13:08.698 --> 13:10.031
Oh.

13:10.032 --> 13:11.299
All right.

13:11.300 --> 13:14.235
What is the circumference
of your areolas?

13:20.576 --> 13:23.578
"Munching on
complimentary popcorn.

13:23.579 --> 13:24.913
Woot, woot."

13:24.914 --> 13:26.247
Oh, the gall.

13:26.248 --> 13:30.168
I hope his next tweet is
"Popcorn lodged in trachea.

13:30.169 --> 13:32.220
"Choking to death.

13:32.221 --> 13:34.122
Woot, woot."

13:34.924 --> 13:37.325
Guys, I am sorry.
We are full up.

13:37.326 --> 13:38.727
No!

13:38.728 --> 13:39.994
We're full up.

13:39.995 --> 13:41.429
We really want
to see this.

13:41.430 --> 13:43.765
Isn't there anything
you can do?

13:43.766 --> 13:45.834
Sorry. Fire regulations.
Should've gotten here earlier.

13:45.835 --> 13:48.670
This is nothing but a
blatant abuse of power

13:48.671 --> 13:50.338
by a petty functionary.

13:50.339 --> 13:52.807
Explain to me why
Wil Wheaton and his lackeys

13:52.808 --> 13:54.509
get in and we don't.

13:54.510 --> 13:58.346
'Cause I'm the petty functionary
with a clipboard, bitch.

14:00.650 --> 14:02.350
I guess that's that.

14:03.219 --> 14:05.019
Let's go home.

14:05.020 --> 14:06.037
You know what?

14:06.038 --> 14:07.656
I'm going back to
"I told you so."

14:07.657 --> 14:08.907
I told you so.

14:10.159 --> 14:11.543
We can still see something.

14:11.544 --> 14:14.245
Oh, the new Sandra Bullock movie
is playing two blocks away.

14:14.246 --> 14:16.765
You know Sandy B.
always brings it.

14:16.766 --> 14:19.200
Look-- a side door.

14:19.201 --> 14:20.769
Come on, Short Round.

14:21.971 --> 14:23.805
I guess we'd better
go after him.

14:23.806 --> 14:25.206
Short Round?

14:25.207 --> 14:26.925
Indy's young sidekick
from <i>Temple of Doom.</i>

14:26.926 --> 14:29.477
Yeah, I know who it
is, but why is it me?

14:29.478 --> 14:31.713
You're right. It should
be a cuddly Asian boy.

14:31.714 --> 14:33.881
Like me.

14:34.984 --> 14:37.419
"And Absolon hath
kist hir nether ye,

14:37.420 --> 14:39.454
"and Nicholas is scalded
in the towte.

14:39.455 --> 14:43.425
This tale is doon,
and God save al the rowte."

14:47.730 --> 14:49.764
What the hell was that?

14:49.765 --> 14:52.634
Bernadette dared me to
tell a dirty story.

14:52.635 --> 14:56.137
"The Miller's Tale" by Chaucer
is the dirtiest story I know.

14:57.306 --> 14:59.007
It would have been hidden
in sock drawers

14:59.008 --> 15:02.644
if people in the 14th century
had worn socks.

15:02.645 --> 15:05.046
I thought it was pretty spicy.

15:05.047 --> 15:08.950
Especially the part
where he kisses her nether ye.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.618
You might not
like it as much

15:10.619 --> 15:12.253
if you knew what
"nether ye" meant.

15:12.254 --> 15:14.289
if one cares
about hygiene,

15:14.290 --> 15:16.825
one ought not be kissing it.

15:18.260 --> 15:19.794
Okay, my turn.

15:19.795 --> 15:21.396
Penny, truth or dare?

15:21.397 --> 15:22.614
Truth.

15:22.615 --> 15:24.966
Why are you still hanging out
with Leonard so much

15:24.967 --> 15:26.468
even though you broke up
with him?

15:26.469 --> 15:28.870
Oh, that's an
excellent question.

15:28.871 --> 15:31.239
For two people who claim to be
no longer pair-bonded,

15:31.240 --> 15:33.675
you spend an inordinate amount
of time in each other's company.

15:33.676 --> 15:35.543
Yeah.

15:37.379 --> 15:39.614
Dare.

15:40.950 --> 15:42.150
I don't believe the rules allow

15:42.151 --> 15:44.052
for an ex post facto
option change.

15:44.053 --> 15:45.854
Yeah.

15:47.656 --> 15:50.391
Okay, look, just because we're
not seeing each other anymore

15:50.392 --> 15:52.060
doesn't mean
we can't be friends.

15:52.061 --> 15:53.862
I mean, Leonard's a great guy.

15:53.863 --> 15:56.064
Then, why did you terminate
your relationship with him?

15:56.065 --> 15:57.432
I don't know.

15:57.433 --> 16:00.301
He got really serious,
and I wasn't ready for it.

16:00.302 --> 16:01.636
Interesting.

16:01.637 --> 16:03.304
How will you react
if, in the future,

16:03.305 --> 16:05.406
you become ready for it,
and Leonard is unavailable,

16:05.407 --> 16:07.542
because another woman
has realized that he is--

16:07.543 --> 16:09.978
to use your words--
"a great guy"?

16:11.747 --> 16:14.282
You can only ask one question.

16:15.284 --> 16:17.552
That one.

16:18.788 --> 16:21.222
You know what,
I don't want to play anymore.

16:27.897 --> 16:29.831
Well, I'm not sure
how this is scored,

16:29.832 --> 16:32.467
but I believe
we may have won.

16:36.238 --> 16:38.106
Sheldon?

16:39.175 --> 16:40.608
Sheldon?

16:40.609 --> 16:42.009
Where did he go?

16:44.613 --> 16:48.183
We're looking for Sheldon,
not Marmaduke.

16:49.018 --> 16:52.186
You whistled?

16:52.187 --> 16:53.488
What is that?

16:53.489 --> 16:55.022
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>

16:55.023 --> 16:57.024
with 21 additional seconds.

16:58.527 --> 17:01.129
If I can't see it,
no one else can see it.

17:01.130 --> 17:02.964
Sheldon, this is crazy.

17:02.965 --> 17:06.667
No. Crazy was leaving
the projection booth unattended.

17:06.669 --> 17:07.919
Listen to me.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.337
You are over-tired.
You're not thinking right.

17:09.338 --> 17:11.973
Put the movie back
before we get into trouble.

17:11.973 --> 17:14.041
Trouble is my middle name,
Leonard.

17:14.042 --> 17:16.845
Actually, it's Lee,
but I prefer Trouble.

17:16.846 --> 17:20.315
Oh, look who
they let in.

17:20.316 --> 17:24.218
Don't worry, Wil Wheaton.
I was just leaving.

17:28.290 --> 17:29.824
Come on, Short Round.

17:29.825 --> 17:31.659
Yeah.

17:34.964 --> 17:37.198
Come on, guys!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

17:37.199 --> 17:38.333
Let's see you run

17:38.334 --> 17:40.768
with a bag of urine
strapped to your leg.

17:40.769 --> 17:43.338
He's got the movie! Get him!

17:48.794 --> 17:52.814
Why is there never a pontoon
plane when you need one?

18:03.822 --> 18:05.823
She's been in there
a long time.

18:05.824 --> 18:08.725
Clearly, losing Truth or Dare
upset her.

18:08.726 --> 18:11.712
Perhaps we should try
to take her mind off it

18:11.713 --> 18:13.697
with another popular
slumber party activity.

18:13.698 --> 18:15.766
Ooh, like what?
Well, the Internet suggests

18:15.767 --> 18:18.135
that slumber party guests
often engage

18:18.136 --> 18:20.237
in harmless experimentation
with lesbianism.

18:23.107 --> 18:25.976
Where exactly on the Internet
have you been looking?

18:27.378 --> 18:29.546
Penny?
Oh, hey, Amy.

18:29.547 --> 18:31.715
Look, I'm sorry I got
so upset. I just...

18:31.716 --> 18:33.584
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:34.419 --> 18:36.086
What are you doing?

18:36.087 --> 18:38.455
Don't worry. I'll
avoid the nether ye.

18:39.524 --> 18:40.908
I might have gone
with eating raw cookie dough.
