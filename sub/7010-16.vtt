WEBVTT

00:04.337 --> 00:06.922
OK. HERE WE GO.

00:07.340 --> 00:10.259
RIGHT HAND, BLUE.

00:16.641 --> 00:19.768
FEZ, YOU CAN'T PLAY
TWISTER BY YOURSELF.

00:19.936 --> 00:23.439
Fez: THAT'S WHERE
YOU ARE WRONG, MY FRIEND.

00:25.775 --> 00:28.110
RIGHT LEG, GREEN.

00:28.445 --> 00:31.739
OH, THAT'S
GONNA BE TOUGH.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.287
HEY, FEZ, MAN,
THE CIRCUS CALLED.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.539
THEY SAID THEY'LL
PAY YOU 50 BUCKS A WEEK

00:40.707 --> 00:44.001
IF YOU CAN
KISS YOUR OWN ASS.

00:44.502 --> 00:47.755
Fez: TAKE A MESSAGE.

00:49.591 --> 00:54.595
I HAVE THE GREATEST
NEWS IN THE WORLD.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.932
HOW THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING THAT?

00:59.100 --> 01:01.935
Fez: I'M DOUBLE-JOINTED.

01:02.604 --> 01:03.854
SUPER.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.898
MY PARENTS ARE RENEWING
THEIR WEDDING VOWS.

01:06.066 --> 01:09.902
WAIT, SO DOUBLE-DATING
DEGENERATES AND SKEEZY BAR HAGS

01:10.070 --> 01:11.320
JUST LOST ITS APPEAL?

01:11.488 --> 01:15.991
YOU'D BE AMAZED HOW FAST
SKEEZY BAR HAGS LOSE THEIR APPEAL.

01:16.159 --> 01:22.289
BUT THEN, LIKE, 2 BEERS LATER,
ITALL COMES ROARING BACK.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.458
NO. FINALLY,
THE INSANITY'S OVER.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.919
YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY
HAPPY ABOUT THIS, ERIC,

01:27.087 --> 01:28.337
AND YOU SHOULD BE, TOO.

01:28.505 --> 01:29.755
MY PARENTS HAVE BEEN
DRIVING ME NUTS,

01:29.923 --> 01:31.590
AND I'VE PROBABLY BEEN
A LITTLE MOODY LATELY.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.968
NO. GOD,
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN MOODY.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.765
OH, THIS IS GREAT.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.433
JACKIE'S GONNA GET
WEDDING FEVER.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.311
MAN, ALL I'M GONNA HEAR IS,
"MICHAEL, AT OUR WEDDING,

01:44.479 --> 01:46.063
DON'T SHOVE CAKE
IN MY FACE,"

01:46.231 --> 01:47.856
AND, "YOU BETTER KNOW
HOW TO DANCE,"

01:48.024 --> 01:52.611
AND, "THERE WILL NOT
BE A TRAMPOLINE."

01:53.238 --> 01:56.281
A WEDDING
WITHOUT A TRAMPOLINE...

01:56.449 --> 01:58.408
THAT'S CRAZY TALK.

01:58.576 --> 02:03.831
YEAH. IT'D BE LIKE A FUNERAL
WITHOUT A DUNK TANK.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.374
YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:05.542 --> 02:07.960
SHE EVEN KNOWS WHAT KIND
OF CHINA PATTERNS SHE WANTS.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.170
PINK AND PURPLE
WITH UNICORNS.

02:10.338 --> 02:15.634
WHO WANTS TO SEE A UNICORN
WHEN THEY'RE EATING PIE?

02:18.429 --> 02:21.849
Fez: LEFT LEG, YELLOW.

02:23.226 --> 02:26.103
WILL SOMEONE PLEASE
HELP ME GET MY PANTS OFF?

02:26.271 --> 02:27.896

AND FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY

03:10.607 --> 03:12.733
QUIT IT.

03:12.901 --> 03:15.194
ARE YOU SURE YOU HAVE
TO HELP YOUR PARENTS

03:15.361 --> 03:16.612
WITH THEIR WEDDING VOWS?

03:16.779 --> 03:19.072
YES. QUIT IT.

03:20.366 --> 03:22.284
I GOT A VOW.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.203
I VOW...

03:24.370 --> 03:26.455
TO KISS YOU SO HARD

03:26.623 --> 03:30.500
YOUR PRETTY LITTLE
RED HEAD POPS OFF.

03:31.794 --> 03:34.671
NO. I COULD
MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

03:34.839 --> 03:36.632
QUIT IT.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.262
DONNA, I'M SORRY...

03:42.430 --> 03:46.058
BUT PINNING ME
ONLY MAKES IT SEXIER.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.477
HEY, KIDS.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.230
HEY, DONNA,
GET OFF OF ME!

03:51.397 --> 03:53.482
HELLO.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.150
HUH, SO, WHAT'S UP?

03:55.318 --> 03:57.236
WELL, YOUR MOM AND I
HAVE BEEN TALKING.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.154
WE HAVE A FEW IDEAS
ABOUT THE VOWS.

03:59.322 --> 04:05.786
FIRST OF ALL, A WEDDING
IS A NICE WAY TO SPEND THE DAY.

04:07.163 --> 04:08.872
WRITE THAT DOWN.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.125
"SPENDING THE DAY WITH
YOUR MOM IS NICE."

04:12.293 --> 04:13.543
THAT'S MY FIRST VOW.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.254
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A VOW.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.005
YES, IT IS.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.757
OK, UH, MOM...

04:18.925 --> 04:20.550
WHY DO YOU WANT
TO GET REMARRIED?

04:20.718 --> 04:23.512
WELL, WHEN YOUR DAD
AND I WERE IN THE ATTIC,

04:23.680 --> 04:26.848
WE FIGURED OUT I STILL
FIT IN MY WEDDING DRESS.

04:27.016 --> 04:28.267
OH,
THAT'S GOOD, TOO.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.435
"MIDGE,
YOU'RE AS THIN TODAY

04:30.603 --> 04:32.562
AS THE DAY
I MARRIED YOU."

04:32.730 --> 04:35.774
THAT'S A NICE VOW.

04:36.567 --> 04:39.319
WRITE.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.366
SO BOTH THE CEREMONY
AND RECEPTION

04:44.534 --> 04:47.327
WILL BE COMPLETELY
GREEN AND GOLD...

04:49.205 --> 04:51.707
IN HONOR OF THE PACKERS.

04:52.208 --> 04:55.127
THAT'S... CLASSY, BOB.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.088
AND RED, SINCE YOU AND I
HAVE A SPECIAL BOND,

04:58.256 --> 05:01.008
I'D LIKE YOU
TO BE MY BEST MAN.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.138
REALLY?

05:06.306 --> 05:07.556
YEP.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.225
WELL, UH,
I DON'T KNOW, BOB.

05:10.393 --> 05:13.729
OH, I THINK
THAT IS JUST LOVELY.

05:17.775 --> 05:21.903
YEAH. FINE. I'D LOVE
TO BE YOUR BEST MAN.

05:22.071 --> 05:24.698
AND, KITTY, SINCE YOU
AND MIDGE ARE SO CLOSE,

05:24.866 --> 05:27.326
SHE'D LIKE TO ASK
YOU A SPECIAL FAVOR.

05:27.493 --> 05:30.829
OH, BOB.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.373
I WOULD BE HONORED
TO BE MIDGE'S...

05:33.541 --> 05:35.625
SHE'D LIKE YOU
TO BRING CHAIRS.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.713
CHAIR-BRINGER.

05:40.548 --> 05:41.798
OH, STEVEN,

05:41.966 --> 05:44.468
HOW'D YOU LIKE TO BE OUR
WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER?

05:44.635 --> 05:47.596
NOPE. I LIKE
TO PARTY AT PARTIES.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.014
I'LL GIVE YOU 10 BUCKS.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.474
20 PLUS A MEATBALL SUB.

05:50.641 --> 05:52.601
Bob: DEAL.
DEAL.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.979
WELL, GOT TO GO PICK UP
MY GREEN AND GOLD TUX.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.814
IT'S A SPECIAL ORDER.

05:57.982 --> 06:01.568
GUY LOOKED AT ME
LIKE I WAS AN IDIOT.

06:04.614 --> 06:08.200
YEAH. THAT WAS THE LOOK.

06:11.621 --> 06:12.913
WELL,
CAN YOU BEAT THAT?

06:13.081 --> 06:16.041
MIDGE AND I ARE MUCH
BETTER FRIENDS THAN YOU AND BOB.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.584
WELL,
MEN'S FRIENDSHIPS ARE...

06:17.752 --> 06:19.544
ALL OF MY LIFE I HAVE
WANTED TO BE A BRIDESMAID.

06:19.712 --> 06:23.340
NONE OF MY FRIENDS HAVE EVER
ASKED ME TO BE A BRIDESMAID.

06:23.508 --> 06:25.425
WELL, THAT'S 'CAUSE
YOU'RE TOO PRETTY.

06:25.593 --> 06:28.345
OH, CAN IT.
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.848
I AM GONNA BE A BRIDESMAID.

06:32.600 --> 06:36.228
HEY, WANNA BE
THE BEST MAN?

06:36.854 --> 06:41.316
I'M SORRY, MAN,
I MUST HAVE LOST YOUR FILM.

06:41.484 --> 06:44.069
ARE YOU SURE
IT WAS THIS HUT?

06:47.949 --> 06:50.409
HEY, MAN. ALL RIGHT.
CHECK THIS OUT, OK?

06:50.576 --> 06:53.286
FRIEND OF MINE'S HAVING
A WEDDING THIS WEEKEND,

06:53.454 --> 06:56.123
AND I TOLD HIM THAT
I'D BE THE PHOTOGRAPHER.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.958
OH, COOL, MAN.

06:58.126 --> 07:01.753
I REMEMBER MY WEDDING.
IT WAS MAGICAL, MAN.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.923
CHICKS AND BOOZE EVERYWHERE.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.926
AND I'D BE WILLING TO MISS
ALL THAT CHICKY-BOOZY FUN

07:08.094 --> 07:09.636
TO TAKE PICTURES, YOU KNOW?

07:09.804 --> 07:12.347
BUT, LEO, MAN,
I GOT A PROBLEM.

07:12.515 --> 07:15.100
I CAN'T SEE
THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER

07:15.268 --> 07:18.061
BECAUSE I HAVE A GLASS EYE.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.776
HOW COME YOUR EYE
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE GLASS, MAN?

07:24.944 --> 07:28.572
WELL, THAT'S 'CAUSE IT'S
SPECIAL SPACE-AGE GLASS.

07:28.739 --> 07:33.076
WHOA.
YOUR EYE WAS IN SPACE?

07:34.662 --> 07:37.080
THAT'S AWESOME, MAN.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.082
OK.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.918
SO, HERE'S THE DEAL,
RIGHT?

07:42.086 --> 07:46.465
JOB PAYS 10 BUCKS
AND HALF A MEATBALL SUB.

07:46.632 --> 07:50.135
SO I'M MISSING OUT
ON A PRETTY SWEET DEAL HERE.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.596
DAMN YOU, GLASS EYE.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.641
WELL, HEY, I COULD
USE THE 10 BUCKS, MAN,

07:56.809 --> 07:59.519
AND HALF A MEATBALL SUB.

07:59.687 --> 08:03.565
IF ONLY I HAD A CAMERA.

08:10.698 --> 08:13.116
WHOA!

08:14.118 --> 08:17.496
HEY, IT'S ALL
COMING TOGETHER, MAN.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.584
WHY DO WE HAVE TO
GETALL DRESSED UP

08:22.752 --> 08:24.377
FOR THIS STUPID
REHEARSAL DINNER?

08:24.545 --> 08:25.795
BECAUSE
MY MOM SAID SO.

08:25.963 --> 08:30.383
AND WE DON'T
ARGUE WITH MOMMY.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.177
OK. SO, JACKIE
HASN'T MADE ME

08:32.345 --> 08:34.346
READ A SINGLE
BRIDE'S MAGAZINE.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.764
I'M TELLING YOU, MAN.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.182
EVER SINCE I SET
HER HOUSE ON FIRE,

08:37.350 --> 08:39.017
SHE'S BEEN ACTING
REALLY WEIRD.

08:39.185 --> 08:42.604
HEY, YOU KNOW, WHEN I'M TRYING
TO GET IN GOOD WITH DONNA,

08:42.772 --> 08:44.064
YOU KNOW WHAT WORKS FOR ME?

08:44.232 --> 08:48.527
I DON'T SET HER HOUSE
ON FIRE. YEAH.

08:50.154 --> 08:53.573
OH, SURE.
HINDSIGHT'S 20/20.

08:55.451 --> 08:58.537
HERE, LOSER, MOM WANTS
YOU TO PUT THIS ON.

08:58.704 --> 09:01.414
HEY, LAURIE.

09:01.582 --> 09:04.084
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN,
YOU IDIOT?

09:04.252 --> 09:06.503
OH, WELL, JACKIE WAS...

09:06.671 --> 09:08.797
I TOLD YOU NEVER
TO SAY THAT NAME TO ME.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.716
WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP!

09:12.843 --> 09:14.553
SEE, THAT'S TRUE, SO...

09:14.720 --> 09:16.638
SHUT UP!

09:23.646 --> 09:25.146
JACKIE, HEAR ME NOW.

09:25.314 --> 09:28.483
I AM NOT HELPING
WITH ANY OF THE WEDDING STUFF.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.860
GOOD.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.821
OH, NICE TRY, JACKIE,

09:32.989 --> 09:36.449
BUT THE REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY'S
NOT GONNA WORK ON ME.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.910
MY MIND'S TOO POWERFUL.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.955
WHATEVER.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.707
OK.

09:44.625 --> 09:47.460
NO, WAIT. JACKIE,
THAT'S CONFUSING!

09:47.628 --> 09:51.006
I'M NOT CHASING
AFTER YOU!

09:56.846 --> 09:59.514
OH, KITTY, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO MEET THE BRIDESMAIDS?

09:59.682 --> 10:02.350
OH, BOB, WOULD I LIKE
TO BE A BRIDESMAID?

10:02.518 --> 10:04.561
NO. WOULD YOU LIKE
TO MEET THE BRIDESMAIDS?

10:04.729 --> 10:07.814
OH. WHATEVER. FINE.

10:08.566 --> 10:09.816
UH, KITTY...

10:09.984 --> 10:12.861
THIS IS BARBARA,
HONOR, AND HOLLY.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.279
HI.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.905
HOLLY'S
THE MAID OF HONOR.

10:16.073 --> 10:20.827
WHICH IS IRONIC THAT HONOR
IS NOT THE MAID OF HONOR.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.038
I AM SO GONNA GET YOU.

10:23.205 --> 10:24.456
SHUT UP!

10:24.624 --> 10:26.666
FOR GOD'S SAKE,
DON'T DO THIS NOW.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.084
Both: YOU SHUT UP!

10:28.252 --> 10:32.505
I DIDN'T FLY IN
FROM ISTANBUL FOR THIS.

10:32.673 --> 10:38.261
WELL, UM, WELL, THAT IS...
IS JUST A LOVELY DRESS.

10:38.429 --> 10:40.805
WHERE DO THE BATTERIES GO?

10:42.266 --> 10:44.476
DRINK UP!

10:46.646 --> 10:47.896
OK, RED,
YOU'RE THE BEST MAN.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.314
YOU MAKE THE TOAST.

10:49.482 --> 10:53.568
I WOULD, BUT I'M
NOT FROM ISTANBUL.

10:53.736 --> 10:57.072
OH, FINE. AHEM.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.783
EXCUSE ME. AHEM.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.743
HELLO?

11:01.911 --> 11:04.120
LISTEN UP, YOU BASTARDS!

11:05.164 --> 11:09.709
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE,
UH, THE BASTARDS THING.

11:09.877 --> 11:13.254
ANYWAY, I'D LIKE TO
MAKE A SPECIAL TOAST

11:13.422 --> 11:16.549
TO 2 VERY SPECIAL
PEOPLE... BOB AND MIDGE.

11:16.717 --> 11:19.302
Crowd: AW.

HERE'S TO BOB AND MIDGE!

11:27.687 --> 11:28.937

11:32.775 --> 11:34.734
Crowd: AW.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.528
RED, THAT WAS
A LOVELY TOAST.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.946
WELL, THANKS.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.115
KITTY, I HAVE ANOTHER
BIG FAVOR TO ASK.

11:40.282 --> 11:41.533
UH-HUH.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.993
AT THE CEREMONY, I'M
WEARING SOMETHING OLD,

11:44.161 --> 11:45.578
SOMETHING NEW,
SOMETHING BORROWED,

11:45.746 --> 11:48.665
AND I WONDERED IF YOU HAD
SOMETHING BLUE I COULD BORROW.

11:48.833 --> 11:51.334
NO, BUT I HAVE
SOMETHING SHARP AND RUSTY

11:51.502 --> 11:54.713
I'D LOVE TO GIVE YOU.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.423
NO, THANKS.

11:56.590 --> 12:00.260
UM, DAD, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

12:00.428 --> 12:01.761
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO WORK

12:01.929 --> 12:05.056
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT
INTO YOUR VOWS,

12:05.224 --> 12:06.808
BUT I'M HAVING
A LITTLE TROUBLE.

12:06.976 --> 12:11.187
DID YOU PUT IN THAT THING
ABOUT YOUR MOM STAYING THIN?

12:12.440 --> 12:13.690
YEAH.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.109
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

12:16.277 --> 12:19.237
WELL, DAD, IT JUST
DOESN'T SEEM VERY...

12:19.405 --> 12:21.698
HEY, THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE
