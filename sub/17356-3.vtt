WEBVTT

00:07.775 --> 00:12.411
- [loud snoring]

00:15.583 --> 00:19.018
- Sure I'll join your squad,
Taylor Swift.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.252
- COLOSSO:
[snoring]

00:20.254 --> 00:22.354
- [cymbals clanging]
- COLOSSO & MAX: [gasping]

00:22.356 --> 00:24.723
- COLOSSO:
Oh. Geez. Oh.

00:24.725 --> 00:28.560
Ah, shake it off, Max.
It's just Phoebe.

00:28.562 --> 00:29.328
- Congratulations.

00:29.330 --> 00:32.064
You actually found a sound more
annoying than your voice.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.665
- It's patrol time,
teammate.

00:33.667 --> 00:34.533
We're trying to join

00:34.535 --> 00:36.201
to most elite superhero
group in the world,

00:36.203 --> 00:39.038
and the Z Force does
not sleep in.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.473
- It's 4:30 a.m.!
- I know.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.208
We're a half an hour late.

00:43.210 --> 00:47.479
Did you even notice
the schedule I made you?

00:47.481 --> 00:49.081
- Your schedule is insane.

00:49.083 --> 00:52.418
You only gave me one
bathroom break a day.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.419
- Exactly.

00:53.421 --> 00:57.089
Here's your diaper.
See you upstairs.

00:57.758 --> 01:00.526
- Right behind you,
partner.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.828
Colosso, you know
what to do.

01:02.830 --> 01:06.331
- Help you with your diaper?

01:06.333 --> 01:07.366
- No.

01:07.368 --> 01:08.700
Hit "snooze."

01:08.702 --> 01:09.768
- Oh.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.303
- [button beeps]

01:11.305 --> 01:13.105
- [metal clanking]

01:13.107 --> 01:14.239
- Good night.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.141
- Good night, sweet prince.

01:16.143 --> 01:18.610
- Stop being creepy.

01:21.615 --> 01:25.250
I'm sorry, Phoebe,
the lair got locked down

01:25.252 --> 01:28.287
and I was forced to go back
to sleep for three hours.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.756
- That was yesterday!

01:30.758 --> 01:33.725
- Huh. No wonder
I feel so refreshed.

01:33.727 --> 01:34.793
Time for breakfast.

01:34.795 --> 01:38.664
- Max, the schedule clearly
states we're brunch people now.

01:38.666 --> 01:39.798
Two meals in one.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.266
Efficiency equals Z Force.

01:41.268 --> 01:44.470
- I wanna get into Z Force, too,
but the answer is not brunch

01:44.472 --> 01:50.275
and diapers--although these
are surprisingly comfy.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.811
- Okay, well, what are you doing
to help our team, huh?

01:52.813 --> 01:53.879
I bet you didn't even buy

01:53.881 --> 01:55.614
the training equipment
we saved up for.

01:55.616 --> 01:58.150
- See, that's where
you're wrong.

01:58.152 --> 01:58.817
- You bought them?

01:58.819 --> 02:01.653
- No, just felt good
to say you're wrong.

02:01.655 --> 02:04.123
- Come on, the Z Force is
tracking our performance.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.158
And training on flour
sack punching bags

02:06.160 --> 02:07.526
doesn't exactly look good.

02:07.528 --> 02:11.864
- [groans] I have flour
in bad places.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.733
- That didn't happen
during training.

02:14.735 --> 02:17.169
I don't know why he's
covered in flour.

02:17.171 --> 02:18.270
- Relax, Phoebe.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.872
I didn't get that training
equipment because I got

02:19.874 --> 02:24.443
something else that's guaranteed
to get us into Z Force--

02:24.445 --> 02:28.147
our very own team
headquarters.

02:28.516 --> 02:32.885
- You spent all of our training
equipment money on a treehouse?

02:32.887 --> 02:38.190
- [laughing] Phoebe,
treehouses are for kids.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.292
It's a tree fort.

02:40.294 --> 02:41.293
- Max, we don't
need this thing.

02:41.295 --> 02:44.163
Our house is already
like a giant headquarters

02:44.165 --> 02:45.464
with free WiFi.

02:45.466 --> 02:48.634
- But this place has aerial
surveillance views,

02:48.636 --> 02:49.902
and is private, and--

02:49.904 --> 02:52.871
Wait, mom and dad don't
charge you for WiFi?

02:52.873 --> 02:54.873
- Okay, Max, you can't
just use our money

02:54.875 --> 02:56.341
to buy a headquarters
without asking me.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.611
- Well, you can't schedule
every second of my life.

02:59.613 --> 03:00.479
I need sleep.

03:00.481 --> 03:03.882
All this doesn't
just happen, you know?

03:03.884 --> 03:06.618
- Uh-oh. I just
realized something.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.352
- Oh, the smell?

03:07.354 --> 03:10.455
Yeah, I think there's a dead
squirrel in here somewhere.

03:10.457 --> 03:11.490
- No.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.759
We make a terrible team.

03:13.761 --> 03:14.526
- That is not true.

03:14.528 --> 03:19.765
If it were, why would I give
you my last yogurt stick?

03:19.767 --> 03:23.235
- Oh, thanks.

03:23.237 --> 03:23.835
Ugh!

03:23.837 --> 03:25.237
What flavor is this?

03:25.239 --> 03:27.573
- Expired.

03:27.575 --> 03:31.510
You're right, we do make
a terrible team.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.545
- ¶

03:33.547 --> 03:34.646
¶ What you see ¶

03:34.648 --> 03:35.847
¶ Is not what you get ¶

03:35.849 --> 03:39.518
¶ Livin' our lives
with a secret ¶

03:39.520 --> 03:40.986
¶ We fit right in ¶

03:40.988 --> 03:42.421
¶ Bet you never guessed ¶

03:42.423 --> 03:43.956
¶ 'Cause we're
livin' our lives ¶

03:43.958 --> 03:45.657
¶ Just like all the rest ¶

03:45.659 --> 03:47.526
¶ A picture
perfect family ¶

03:47.528 --> 03:49.494
¶ Is what we try to be ¶

03:49.496 --> 03:50.796
¶ Look closer,
you might see ¶

03:50.798 --> 03:52.531
¶ The crazy things we do ¶

03:52.533 --> 03:54.399
¶ This isn't
make believe ¶

03:54.401 --> 03:55.834
¶ It's our reality ¶

03:55.836 --> 03:56.935
¶ Just your average family ¶

03:56.937 --> 04:00.572
¶ Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble ¶

04:00.574 --> 04:04.810
¶ Livin' a double life ¶¶

04:07.748 --> 04:09.548
- ¶

04:09.550 --> 04:14.019
- So today revealed our team has
a few wrinkles to iron out.

04:14.021 --> 04:14.553
- A few?

04:14.555 --> 04:18.523
Our team has more wrinkles than
an old lady in a tanning salon.

04:18.525 --> 04:21.460
Worst summer job ever.

04:22.029 --> 04:25.030
- But joining the Z Force has
always been a dream of mine,

04:25.032 --> 04:26.665
and if being your teammate
is the only way to

04:26.667 --> 04:30.669
make that happen, then I'll
do anything to make it work.

04:30.671 --> 04:31.203
- Me, too.

04:31.205 --> 04:35.507
Unless it means doing things
for you, with you, or near you.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.942
- Pretty sure
it's a bad attitude

04:36.944 --> 04:39.077
that got you fired
from the Tanny Granny.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.713
Oh, we are officially
hopeless.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.982
- HANK:
Have no fear...

04:43.984 --> 04:46.418
Thunder Man is here!

04:46.420 --> 04:49.855
- And where there's thunder,
there's Electress!

04:49.857 --> 04:52.157
- [electrical zapping]

04:52.726 --> 04:54.693
- Why are you guys
in your supersuits?

04:54.695 --> 04:56.862
- We're suited up because
we're about to save you two

04:56.864 --> 04:59.564
from blowing your chance
at the Z Force.

04:59.566 --> 05:01.933
- And it's laundry day.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.436
Now, as life mates
and superhero partners,

05:04.438 --> 05:07.072
we know a lot about building
a successful team.

05:07.074 --> 05:10.509
- In fact, we put out
a self-help book in the '90s

05:10.511 --> 05:13.078
called "Smells Like
Team Spirit."

05:13.080 --> 05:15.847
- How come we've
never seen it?

05:17.851 --> 05:19.951
- PHOEBE & MAX:
[laughing]

05:19.953 --> 05:22.554
- That's why.

05:22.556 --> 05:23.288
- So what do you say?

05:23.290 --> 05:27.426
Let us help you two become
the team we know you can be.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.727
- I mean, hey, if it'll
help our chances

05:28.729 --> 05:31.129
of getting in the Z Force,
it's worth a shot.

05:31.131 --> 05:31.830
- I agree.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.131
I'm just not gonna
read any books.

05:33.133 --> 05:38.970
- Oh, good thing it comes
with an instructional video.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.442
- Please tell me there's
room in your schedule

05:43.444 --> 05:44.443
to make fun of Mom and Dad?

05:44.445 --> 05:46.144
- You're gonna have to skip
brushing your teeth,

05:46.146 --> 05:47.913
but we can make it work.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.549
- HANK:
[laughing]

05:54.588 --> 05:56.154
- COLOSSO:
Ugh!

05:56.156 --> 05:59.157
You expect me to
eat this slop?!

05:59.159 --> 06:02.794
- I don't cook it.
I just dump it.

06:04.998 --> 06:05.597
- Ugh!

06:05.599 --> 06:07.466
You know, back when
Max was evil,

06:07.468 --> 06:09.468
he used to steal me
fresh vegetables

06:09.470 --> 06:11.002
from all the neighbors'
gardens.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.604
- Well, Max is good now,

06:12.606 --> 06:14.639
and no one's stealing
vegetables for you,

06:14.641 --> 06:17.976
so just eat your
canned succotash.

06:19.513 --> 06:20.746
- You know what?

06:20.748 --> 06:23.014
You all succotash!

06:25.652 --> 06:26.618
- Hey, you guys.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.186
Will you tell me if
I'm gonna hit the table?

06:28.188 --> 06:30.522
- [heavy thud]

06:31.825 --> 06:33.925
- You hit the table.

06:35.662 --> 06:38.063
- Billy, why aren't you using
your new backpack?

06:38.065 --> 06:39.598
- A nice kid at school
borrowed it--

06:39.600 --> 06:42.167
along with my lunch money
and math homework.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.201
- That's not good.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.669
- Yeah, especially
for the poor kid

06:44.671 --> 06:47.806
who stole your math homework.
[laughing]

06:47.808 --> 06:51.109
- No, I meant it's not good
that you're so gullible.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.144
- What's gullible?

06:52.146 --> 06:53.879
- There's a raccoon
in your shorts.

06:53.881 --> 06:56.648
- [gasps]
Aah, get it out!

06:56.650 --> 06:57.549
- That's gullible.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.117
It means you're
easily tricked.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.252
- I am not.

07:00.254 --> 07:01.553
- The raccoon's back.

07:01.555 --> 07:04.222
- Aah!
[zooming]

07:05.893 --> 07:09.261
- Oh, so it's funny
when you do it.

07:12.699 --> 07:13.698
- Well, well, well.

07:13.700 --> 07:17.803
Sounds like Gulli-Billy might
be my ticket to veggie town.

07:18.839 --> 07:25.110
Ach! Ach! This food
is all succ and no tash.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.878
Ugh!

07:26.880 --> 07:29.114
- Now, you've watched
the teambuilding video

07:29.116 --> 07:33.118
critics called
"a super-powered joyride."

07:33.120 --> 07:35.120
- That quote's from you.

07:35.122 --> 07:41.259
- The point is you're now ready
for teambuilding exercises!

07:41.261 --> 07:45.630
- Any time you're a bad
teammate, Nora will zap you.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.032
- [lasers zapping]
- PHOEBE & MAX: Ow!

07:47.034 --> 07:50.335
- I could tell you weren't
thinking about the team.

07:50.637 --> 07:56.241
- Now, your first exercise will
really put the art in partner.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.944
- BARB & HANK:
[laughing]

07:58.946 --> 08:02.747
- This puts the stupid
in stupid.

08:04.751 --> 08:07.152
- Now, you'll each
take turns painting.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.887
Soon you'll have
a beautiful piece of art

08:08.889 --> 08:10.655
representing your team.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.624
- Okay.
Guess I'll go first.

08:12.626 --> 08:13.825
- Uh, Phoebe?
Allow me.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.195
You have the art skills
of a howler monkey.

08:19.299 --> 08:22.634
- [powers whooshing]

08:22.636 --> 08:25.103
- Wow. Hey, you are
remarkably good at that.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.004
But it's my turn.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.038
- Hold on.
I'm on a roll.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.907
- No, come on, Max.
It's my turn.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.642
- And...done.

08:30.644 --> 08:31.776
Ha ha!

08:31.778 --> 08:34.346
Now this says team.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.782
- You painted your face.

08:37.784 --> 08:42.854
- Yeah, well, can't spell
"team" without "me."

08:43.323 --> 08:45.156
- [lasers zapping]
- MAX: Ow!

08:45.158 --> 08:48.326
- This is better
than the free WiFi.

08:49.796 --> 08:53.398
- When it comes to teams, the
word "mine" should be avoided,

08:53.400 --> 08:59.804
which is why we've turned our
driveway into a minefield!

08:59.806 --> 09:01.640
- Nice wordplay, Dad.

09:01.642 --> 09:04.175
Also, won't we blow up?

09:04.177 --> 09:06.945
- No. These are
smoke mines.

09:06.947 --> 09:09.915
And they're perfectly safe.

09:12.686 --> 09:13.818
- We'll give you
a two-second peek

09:13.820 --> 09:15.987
at the map of where
the mines are located.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.857
Then you'll work together
to avoid them.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.058
Got it?

09:20.060 --> 09:22.127
Good luck, team.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.330
- Okay. I've got
a photographic memory.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.732
Follow my lead.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.367
- Okay, okay, Phoebe,
I can help.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.403
- Okay, uh, I'm not gonna
listen to the guy

09:31.405 --> 09:35.106
who forgot his twin
sister's birthday.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.274
- I did not forget it.

09:36.276 --> 09:39.110
I just chose to ignore it.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.913
- Okay, and I just
choose to ignore you.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.984
- [buzzing, hissing]

09:45.986 --> 09:46.985
- Zap her, Nora.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.386
- [lasers zapping]
- PHOEBE: Ow!

09:48.388 --> 09:49.754
- [chuckles]
Nice shot.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.022
- [lasers zapping]
- MAX: Ow!

09:51.024 --> 09:53.124
- I don't like kiss-ups.

09:57.731 --> 10:02.133
- Trail of candy leading
right to Colosso.

10:02.135 --> 10:07.472
- Oh, Billy, I'm so glad
you fell for it.

10:07.474 --> 10:08.306
I'm sorry.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.741
It's just that
I planted vegetables

10:09.743 --> 10:12.877
in our neighbors' gardens, but
have no way of getting them.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.746
- I hate to see
you like this.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.215
So I'm gonna go
back upstairs.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.985
- If only I knew a person
with a kind heart

10:19.987 --> 10:22.153
and superspeed
who could help.

10:22.155 --> 10:25.924
- Hey, I have a kind
heart and superspeed.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.392
I can help.

10:27.394 --> 10:28.259
- Really?

10:28.261 --> 10:29.828
You're my hero, Billy!

10:29.830 --> 10:31.396
- Wish Nora heard
you say that.

10:31.398 --> 10:34.199
Can you believe
she thinks I'm gullible?

10:34.201 --> 10:36.334
- G--you, gullible?

10:36.336 --> 10:37.068
Never.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.137
Now, here are the addresses
of the gardens

10:39.139 --> 10:42.240
where I planted
my vegetables.

10:44.511 --> 10:47.078
- Wait a minute.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.848
That's how you spell
Hiddenville?

10:52.252 --> 10:56.087
- It's almost too easy.
[chuckling]

10:56.923 --> 11:00.325
- Welcome to the telekinesis
trust fall.

11:00.327 --> 11:03.361
- Teammates need to always
have each other's backs.

11:03.363 --> 11:07.198
If not, you could end up
in a serious jam.

11:07.200 --> 11:07.899
[laughing]

11:07.901 --> 11:12.971
- Get it? 'Cause the pit's
filled with jam.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.072
- Yeah, we get it.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.073
You guys rolled.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.075
Can we get to the training
part now, please?

11:17.077 --> 11:20.278
- In this test, these thunder
balls can swing down

11:20.280 --> 11:22.814
and knock you off your
platform at any moment.

11:22.816 --> 11:26.284
- So be ready to use your powers
to catch each other in midair,

11:26.286 --> 11:30.422
or you could end up
in a real...pickle.

11:30.424 --> 11:31.222
[laughing]

11:31.224 --> 11:33.324
- Hank, pickle toss is later.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.125
- Oh.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.227
- Okay. Keep your arms
in front of you.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.429
It'll quicken
your reaction time.

11:37.431 --> 11:40.231
[powers whooshing]
- Whoa!

11:40.233 --> 11:41.466
I was just stretching.

11:41.468 --> 11:42.901
Stop being a control freak.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.235
- I'm not a control freak.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.504
Now just do exactly
as I say.

11:46.506 --> 11:49.507
- Oh, right, 'cause
you're the boss of me.

11:49.509 --> 11:50.542
Oops, 3:00 o'clock.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.977
I missed my potty break.

11:52.979 --> 11:57.115
- First of all, your potty
break is at 4:00.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.850
At least I care
about this team.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.018
All you care
about is yourself.

12:00.020 --> 12:03.388
- I care about the team,
especially my half of it.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.390
- Oh, you mean the half
that didn't ask me

12:05.392 --> 12:07.992
before buying
a rat-infested treehouse.

12:07.994 --> 12:09.127
- They are not rats.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.362
They're just really
big termites.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.198
- Guys, stay focused.

12:13.200 --> 12:13.932
- Face it, Max.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.300
You are the reason
we don't make a good team.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.335
- Oh, really, 'cause
I think it's you.

12:17.337 --> 12:20.004
Put that in your diaper
and wear it.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.407
- MAX & PHOEBE:
Whoa!

12:22.409 --> 12:24.442
- Oh!
- Oh.

12:28.115 --> 12:28.880
- You guys okay?

12:28.882 --> 12:31.015
- Yeah, this exercise
made me realize

12:31.017 --> 12:33.451
I never wanna be partners
with Max again!

12:33.453 --> 12:34.886
- Yeah.
This team is done.

12:34.888 --> 12:38.389
- I'd zap them, but they
already zapped themselves.

12:38.391 --> 12:39.190
Oh, what the heck.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.860
- [lasers zapping]
- MAX & PHOEBE: Ow!

12:49.035 --> 12:51.236
- Phoebe, you're wearing
your supersuit.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.204
Does this mean you
and Max made up?

12:53.206 --> 12:56.374
- I decided that the Z Force
is more important

12:56.376 --> 12:57.208
than any silly fights,

12:57.210 --> 12:59.210
so I figured out a way
to work with Max.

12:59.212 --> 13:02.080
- Oh, we are
so proud of you!

13:02.082 --> 13:04.315
- [powers whooshing]

13:07.220 --> 13:13.458
- I'm replacing Max with this
dummy that looks like Max.

13:14.461 --> 13:18.463
- Honey, did you hit your
head on the jam pit?

13:18.632 --> 13:20.231
- No, but with
the Z Force watching,

13:20.233 --> 13:22.200
I need to make it look like
Max is still my partner.

13:22.202 --> 13:26.371
- So you're gonna lug
a dummy all over town?

13:26.373 --> 13:29.541
- Yeah.
Nothing's changed.

13:29.543 --> 13:32.310
Plus, this dummy doesn't
do selfish things

13:32.312 --> 13:33.978
like buy useless tree forts.

13:33.980 --> 13:37.615
- Actually, it's now
called an air lair.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.617
Good-looking mannequin.

13:39.619 --> 13:43.321
- Come on, new Max.
We've got a city to save.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.331
Still a better partner.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.301
- Max, follow her
and end this silly fight.

13:56.303 --> 13:59.437
- No way. That control freak
called me selfish.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.140
- Why are you holding
our microwave?

14:02.142 --> 14:03.408
- Take it to my air lair.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.076
And you guys get
to buy a new one.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.345
See? Not selfish.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.416
- I had a burrito in there.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.119
- [zooming]

14:15.121 --> 14:17.388
- That's some sweet
corn-on-the-cob.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.357
Put it with the stash.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.029
- Dr. Colosso?

14:25.031 --> 14:26.264
- We're pals now, Billy.

14:26.266 --> 14:29.300
Call me Uncle Dr. Colosso.

14:29.302 --> 14:32.136
- There's one thing
I'm confused about.

14:32.138 --> 14:34.439
- One thing?
[chuckles]

14:34.441 --> 14:36.207
Go on.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.443
- Why do you plant
all these vegetables

14:38.445 --> 14:39.777
in other people's gardens?

14:39.779 --> 14:43.014
- Billy, farmers are
like magicians.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.749
We never reveal our secrets,

14:44.751 --> 14:48.486
and we're always
slightly creepy.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.456
- I have so much
to learn from you.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.091
- But you're
already so smart,

14:53.093 --> 14:56.127
which is why I need you to
harvest 20 pounds of potatoes

14:56.129 --> 14:59.163
I planted at
the supermarket.

14:59.165 --> 15:00.465
- Coming right up.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.367
- Thanks, Gulli-Billy.

15:02.369 --> 15:03.334
- What did you say?

15:03.336 --> 15:07.205
- Ah, I said you're
like a son to me.

15:07.207 --> 15:11.209
- Aw, you're like
a moon to me.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.377
- Please just go.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.746
- [zooming]

15:16.616 --> 15:18.583
- Billy, we've been
looking for you.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.084
Someone's been
stealing vegetables

15:20.086 --> 15:22.186
from the gardens in
the neighborhood.

15:22.188 --> 15:22.720
- What?

15:22.722 --> 15:24.756
As a new member of
the farming community,

15:24.758 --> 15:26.357
that just makes me sick.

15:26.359 --> 15:30.395
- Does the veggie bandit
look familiar?

15:30.397 --> 15:34.599
- No, but she's kinda cute.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.135
- She's kinda you.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.703
- What? That's crazy.

15:38.705 --> 15:41.506
Now if you'll excuse me,
I need to pick up some potatoes

15:41.508 --> 15:43.508
Colosso planted at
the supermarket.

15:43.510 --> 15:46.611
- Billy, people don't plant
stuff at supermarkets.

15:46.613 --> 15:52.350
Dr. Colosso's duping you into
stealing vegetables for him.

15:52.352 --> 15:53.551
- Oh, no.

15:53.553 --> 15:57.255
That cute girl is me?

15:57.257 --> 15:58.356
That means I am gullible.

15:58.358 --> 16:01.392
- No, you're a nice person
who trusts people.

16:01.394 --> 16:02.593
Colosso's the problem here,

16:02.595 --> 16:06.364
which is why we are going to
teach that evil bunny a lesson.

16:06.366 --> 16:06.931
- Good idea.

16:06.933 --> 16:09.400
I'll help--right after
I get him his potatoes.

16:09.402 --> 16:10.735
[zooming]

16:10.737 --> 16:12.403
- I'll get him.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.339
[whooshing]

16:15.775 --> 16:16.474
- [dog growling]

16:16.476 --> 16:18.776
- Let go of my Z Force partner,
you dumb dog!

16:18.778 --> 16:21.646
- [dog barking]
- [gasps]

16:21.648 --> 16:22.547
Fine, keep him!

16:22.549 --> 16:25.249
He's as useless
as the real Max.

16:28.555 --> 16:33.224
- Phoebe, it's time to stop,
collaborate, and listen.

16:35.829 --> 16:40.231
- Wow, is it '90s day
wherever parents hang out?

16:42.635 --> 16:43.701
- As if.

16:43.703 --> 16:47.438
We broke out our team spirit
outfits to help you and Max.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.508
- You guys are too
legit to quit.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.644
- All right,
speak normal or I walk.

16:53.646 --> 16:54.312
- Fine.

16:54.314 --> 16:57.281
Let's, uh, just make sundaes
and figure out a way

16:57.283 --> 17:02.487
for you and Max to become all
that and a bag of chips.

17:02.489 --> 17:03.454
I'm sorry.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.523
[clears throat]

17:06.159 --> 17:08.693
- I mean, you guys should really
be talking to Max about this.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.895
He's the one who's
straight-up buggin'.

17:10.897 --> 17:13.564
[sighs]
Now I'm doing it.

17:13.566 --> 17:18.436
- There's nothing you can do to
make yourself a better partner?

17:18.438 --> 17:18.903
- No.

17:18.905 --> 17:21.439
Oh, Dad, your hot fudge-
to-ice-cream ratio is a mess.

17:21.441 --> 17:22.206
- Hey, it's mine.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.608
- Okay, just let me fix
it, all right?

17:23.610 --> 17:24.675
Efficiency equals
delicious--

17:24.677 --> 17:27.879
- Check yourself before you
wreck yourself, Phoebe!

17:27.881 --> 17:29.647
- [heavy thud]

17:29.649 --> 17:32.183
- [plaster splatters]

17:32.652 --> 17:34.619
- Wha...?

17:34.621 --> 17:35.653
What was that about?

17:35.655 --> 17:36.954
- Well, honey,
you mean well,

17:36.956 --> 17:39.957
but you can be
a tad controlling--

17:39.959 --> 17:41.859
like how you're taking
sprinkles off

17:41.861 --> 17:43.227
my ice cream right now.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.262
- Okay, Mom, you can't
just mix rainbow

17:44.264 --> 17:49.634
and chocolate sprinkles
because--oh!

17:49.636 --> 17:51.569
Maybe I am controlling.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.505
Ugh, I guess I should probably
go apologize to Max

17:54.507 --> 17:55.973
for being a bad teammate.

17:55.975 --> 17:57.375
- Good idea, honey.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.310
- PHOEBE:
[sighs]

17:59.846 --> 18:02.847
- She's gone, Hank.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.248
- [chuckling]

18:04.250 --> 18:09.420
Oh! I've got ceiling
chips in my sundae.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.757
[crunching]
Not bad.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.859
- Phoebe's crazy.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.761
This air lair is great.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.397
And so is Dad's
burrito I found.

18:19.399 --> 18:22.300
[laughs]
Can't stop winning.

18:23.269 --> 18:24.535
- Hey, Max.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.671
- Winning streak over.

18:26.673 --> 18:27.672
What are you doing
here, Phoebe?

18:27.674 --> 18:30.842
My guard owl was supposed to
warn me about intruders.

18:30.844 --> 18:34.278
- [owl hooting]
- Too late, Desmond!

18:34.280 --> 18:37.281
- Max, I came to apologize
for being controlling.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.450
I just really, really
want this team to work.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.820
But I promise, from here
on out, no more schedules

18:42.822 --> 18:46.290
and no more sneaking vitamins
into your pizza.

18:46.292 --> 18:49.527
- I knew I was getting
strong teeth and bones.

18:49.529 --> 18:52.830
- The point is, I'm sorry.

18:52.832 --> 18:53.931
- [inhales]

18:53.933 --> 18:55.299
I'm sorry, too.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.335
Sorry I have a sister
who thinks I'm selfish

18:57.337 --> 18:59.971
and can't respect
my pizza boundaries.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.839
- Are you kidding me?
You are selfish.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.308
Look at this trash
can on stilts.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.777
- It's an air lair!
[stomping foot]

19:06.779 --> 19:09.313
- [tree fort rumbling,
wood creaking]

19:09.315 --> 19:13.518
- [board clattering]
- [owl hoots]

19:13.520 --> 19:14.285
- What's happening?

19:14.287 --> 19:15.987
- Don't you hear my guard owl?
We're at three hoots.

19:15.989 --> 19:19.457
This place is falling apart!
Go, go, go!

19:19.459 --> 19:23.461
- [tree fort rumbling, creaking]
- [ladder clatters]

19:23.463 --> 19:25.429
- That crash you just heard
was the sound of

19:25.431 --> 19:26.164
your ladder breaking,

19:26.166 --> 19:28.566
which means we have no way down
unless you have a parachute.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.468
- Why didn't you tell me
that when I bought this thing?

19:30.470 --> 19:32.436
- You didn't tell me
you were buying it!

19:32.438 --> 19:35.373
- [wood creaking,
boards clattering]

19:35.375 --> 19:38.009
- ¶ Old Colosso had a farm ¶

19:38.011 --> 19:42.013
¶ Thanks to Gulli-Billy ¶

19:42.015 --> 19:43.748
- Colosso,
some police officers

19:43.750 --> 19:45.917
accused me of stealing
the vegetables

19:45.919 --> 19:47.852
from around
the neighborhood!

19:47.854 --> 19:49.420
- Cops!

19:49.422 --> 19:54.926
I mean, what did you tell
the nice officers?

19:54.928 --> 19:55.560
- The truth.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.929
That you told me to take
all of these veggies.

19:57.931 --> 19:59.964
- [police siren]
- COLOSSO: [gasps]

19:59.966 --> 20:03.100
You rat!
You led them right to me!

20:03.102 --> 20:06.370
- Colosso, there are cops
coming down here!

20:06.372 --> 20:08.873
- Johnny Law'll never get me!

20:08.875 --> 20:10.641
Adios, losers.

20:10.643 --> 20:11.876
- [button beeps]
- Aah!

20:11.878 --> 20:16.380
- [small thud]
- COLOSSO: Ooh!

20:16.382 --> 20:18.849
[groaning]

20:18.851 --> 20:21.719
Is this Albuquerque?

20:21.721 --> 20:23.521
- Why don't you
ask the sheriff?

20:23.523 --> 20:27.091
- [whooshing]
You're under arrest, baby.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.895
- What's with
the kindergarten cop?

20:30.897 --> 20:34.665
- We set this whole thing up to
teach you not to trick Billy.

20:34.667 --> 20:38.569
- Enjoy your dinner,
Uncle Dr. Gullible.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.539
- Oh.

20:41.541 --> 20:46.510
Uh, uh...looks like
I succotash.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.446
[groans]
- [small thud]

20:50.817 --> 20:52.650
- [wood creaking]

20:52.652 --> 20:56.687
- This is horrible!
- [tree fort rumbling]

20:56.689 --> 20:58.956
- Not my burrito!

20:58.958 --> 21:02.093
- Forget about your burrito.
We're next.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.494
- Phoebe, I--I'm sorry.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.730
You were right about this
whole tree fort thing.

21:05.732 --> 21:06.797
It was a mistake.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.566
I shouldn't have
been so selfish.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.835
- [boards clattering]
- [wood creaking]

21:10.837 --> 21:13.537
- Apologize later.
This thing's going down.

21:13.539 --> 21:15.740
- [wood creaking]
- Hurry, we gotta jump!

21:15.742 --> 21:18.843
- [tree fort rumbling]

21:18.845 --> 21:20.711
- One, two--

21:20.713 --> 21:22.980
- MAX & PHOEBE:
[screaming]

21:22.982 --> 21:24.815
[screaming continues]

21:24.817 --> 21:26.017
- Why are we still yelling?

21:26.019 --> 21:28.586
- I don't know!
Let's get down.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.554
- [powers whooshing]

21:31.424 --> 21:35.059
- We just pulled off
a telekinetic trust fall.

21:35.061 --> 21:35.660
- I know.

21:35.662 --> 21:36.994
We actually had each
other's backs.

21:36.996 --> 21:40.064
[sniffs]
Phoebe? You smell that?

21:40.066 --> 21:40.965
- Sure do.

21:40.967 --> 21:41.966
It smells like team spirit.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.467
- Well, I was gonna
say it smells like

21:43.469 --> 21:44.735
a dead squirrel burrito,

21:44.737 --> 21:47.471
but maybe we do actually
make a good team.

21:47.473 --> 21:50.074
- Which means our Z Force
dreams are still alive.

21:50.076 --> 21:51.442
- And with a couple of nails,

21:51.444 --> 21:53.744
our headquarters
will be good as new.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.613
- [wood creaking]

21:55.615 --> 21:58.716
- [boards clattering]

21:58.718 --> 22:00.751
- [metal clangs]

22:00.753 --> 22:04.588
- Heh. Who needs a headquarters?
- Not us.

22:04.590 --> 22:07.792
- ¶

22:10.630 --> 22:26.644
- ¶
