01:14.106 --> 01:16.009
The furnishings can all be removed if, uh...

01:16.109 --> 01:19.579
No. I would want the furnishing as they are.

01:19.679 --> 01:20.893
Okay.

01:27.387 --> 01:31.308
- When would you want the house?
- I'd want it immediately.

01:31.408 --> 01:33.807
- Have you been looking long?
- I have.

01:36.996 --> 01:39.499
There hasn't been anyone
here for a few years.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.668
Is it what you are looking for?

01:41.868 --> 01:44.071
Which way does this room face?

01:45.805 --> 01:48.008
This room faces west.

01:53.212 --> 01:54.752
West.

02:00.052 --> 02:01.789
I want this house.

02:02.922 --> 02:05.726
It's a one year minimum contract, I'm afraid.

02:06.326 --> 02:09.252
A year then, how much?

02:09.352 --> 02:13.166
Ten thousand four hundred.
Eight hundred deposit.

02:15.001 --> 02:16.304
<i>This is for you.</i>

02:17.136 --> 02:19.139
For the paper work.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.342
For privacy.

03:07.554 --> 03:09.422
You can do this?

03:09.622 --> 03:11.758
Do you think this is an interview?

03:11.858 --> 03:13.360
No.

03:14.294 --> 03:16.296
Who else did you ask?

03:16.696 --> 03:19.663
Michael Stotes, Ukeme Bantaam...

03:19.763 --> 03:21.969
- ...Alexandra Pol...
- Okay.

03:26.906 --> 03:29.109
Are we going to go and look at the house?

03:38.518 --> 03:40.994
Okay. The fucking house.

04:03.710 --> 04:07.079
- It's cold in here.
- There's no heating.

04:07.179 --> 04:09.249
There's no heating?

04:09.349 --> 04:11.351
You're not selling this.

04:11.551 --> 04:15.756
- It doesn't matter, does it?
- What, the heating? No.

04:20.459 --> 04:22.329
You not having one?

04:25.031 --> 04:28.358
You started then? Purifying yourself?

04:28.598 --> 04:29.837
Yes.

04:30.537 --> 04:32.405
Let's hear it.

04:32.905 --> 04:34.942
I've followed the diet.

04:36.008 --> 04:38.812
I've had no alcohol for 22 weeks.

04:39.746 --> 04:43.803
- I've abstained from sex.
- All sex? Masturbation as well?

04:44.083 --> 04:45.322
All sex.

04:45.422 --> 04:47.855
Yeah, it gets tricky after a month, don't it?

04:48.488 --> 04:50.357
And the diet?

04:50.857 --> 04:52.925
The last 27 days...

04:53.025 --> 04:55.628
...I have only eaten between dusk and dawn.

04:56.496 --> 04:58.966
For the next three days,
I'll fast completely.

04:59.666 --> 05:02.469
Are you Protestant or Catholic?

05:03.570 --> 05:05.204
I'm Catholic.

05:05.304 --> 05:06.973
Catholic.

05:07.073 --> 05:08.616
And the rite?

05:17.950 --> 05:20.788
The Abramelin. You're not fucking about.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.070
No.

05:24.170 --> 05:26.359
I've done this three times.

05:26.459 --> 05:28.395
Once it worked, twice it didn't.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.363
It didn't?

05:30.463 --> 05:33.885
Well, I was younger,
you've got to have the right person.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.007
Why?

05:39.872 --> 05:41.709
For love.

05:41.908 --> 05:43.193
For love.

05:44.243 --> 05:48.216
I love someone, they don't love me anymore.

06:11.270 --> 06:12.839
Well?

06:13.439 --> 06:15.309
Well what?

06:16.776 --> 06:18.812
Are you going to do it?

06:19.779 --> 06:21.315
No.

06:22.315 --> 06:23.852
Why?

06:26.052 --> 06:27.854
House isn't right.

06:28.254 --> 06:32.759
There's nothing wrong with this house.
It is everything you asked for. You agreed...

06:32.859 --> 06:36.095
The only thing I agreed to
was to look at the house.

06:36.195 --> 06:38.632
And I did and I want my money.

06:39.966 --> 06:43.225
- But I've done everything.
- Just give me my money.

06:43.325 --> 06:45.173
I wanna get back to London.

06:46.839 --> 06:49.643
- Listen, this is...
- Just give it to me.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.021
You can do it by yourself, you don't need me.

07:02.121 --> 07:03.923
That's rubbish.

07:04.023 --> 07:08.028
You need someone there,
someone who knows the procedure.

07:09.328 --> 07:11.765
Who told you that, Michael Stotes?

07:14.400 --> 07:17.471
You girls, you stupid, little posh girls.

07:18.370 --> 07:20.573
Abramelin procedure just to force love.

07:20.673 --> 07:24.679
It's like getting Titian to decorate a cake.

07:27.646 --> 07:29.515
I love this person.

07:32.284 --> 07:36.155
Get over him, just go on a fucking
dating website or something.

07:36.255 --> 07:41.539
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't. Fucking love.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.470
I'm gonna have fish and chips
when I get home. That's what I fancy.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.773
Waste of fucking time coming here.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.719
I'll pay you 70,000.

08:06.819 --> 08:10.022
- Doesn't matter.
- Eighty, it's all I've got.

08:10.122 --> 08:12.160
You're not fucking listening.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.397
My child died.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.634
I lost my child.

08:22.268 --> 08:24.872
He was taken from me and it was my fault.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.243
I have to hear his voice again.

08:30.276 --> 08:32.346
I need to speak to him.

08:34.647 --> 08:36.923
Talk to your dead child?

08:37.183 --> 08:40.188
That might be something worth
getting up in the morning for.

08:41.386 --> 08:43.224
Why did you lie?

08:44.155 --> 08:46.394
I thought it would be too much.

08:46.959 --> 08:50.197
Is it the truth? That's important.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.566
It is.

08:55.935 --> 08:58.438
You get to ask for what you want too.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.506
How much do you want it?

09:00.606 --> 09:02.443
More than anything.

09:24.013 --> 09:26.650
I'm having the bedroom with the bed in it.

09:27.216 --> 09:30.653
You will cook and clean.
You do know what we're taking on?

09:30.753 --> 09:32.290
Yes.

09:33.122 --> 09:35.778
- And you know the dangers?
- I do.

09:35.878 --> 09:38.260
This is a serious undertaking.

09:38.360 --> 09:41.297
It's not fucking astral projection or runes.

09:41.397 --> 09:43.633
This is real stuff we're playing with.

09:43.733 --> 09:46.803
- Real angels, real demons.
- I know this.

09:46.903 --> 09:50.773
You read cunts on the internet
saying it's just mental states.

09:50.873 --> 09:53.846
That your... that your Guardian
Angel is your higher self.

09:54.276 --> 09:56.112
Psychobabble bollocks.

09:56.212 --> 09:59.849
You'll go for days without sleep, fasting...

09:59.949 --> 10:02.952
...backbreaking rites, ritual sex.

10:03.552 --> 10:05.423
You'll be at the very edge.

10:06.255 --> 10:09.012
You, uh, ready for all that, darling?

10:09.112 --> 10:10.993
I am.

10:11.093 --> 10:13.146
I've read up on the Kabbalah.

10:13.730 --> 10:17.562
You don't think this is the Tree
of Sephiroth? 'Cause, 'cause it's not.

10:18.901 --> 10:21.339
You've been looking shit up on the internet.

10:22.271 --> 10:24.646
No, this is Gnosticism.

10:24.746 --> 10:27.409
I was told it was based on the Kabbalah.

10:27.509 --> 10:31.213
It's there as grammar. A structure.

10:31.313 --> 10:34.150
The Kabbalah's an exploration of God.

10:34.250 --> 10:36.886
We're doing something much darker.

11:00.409 --> 11:03.079
"Salt, chalk, paint,
paint brushes, three inches...

11:03.179 --> 11:07.750
...five inches, tape, white masking tape,
green masking tape, tee lights, candles."

11:07.850 --> 11:10.519
Food. Four months supply of meat?

11:10.619 --> 11:13.255
Six months minimum, maybe eight.

11:13.355 --> 11:15.559
Once this starts there's no leaving.

11:17.526 --> 11:21.864
I need to get to, uh,
an Internet cafe, to a computer.

11:21.964 --> 11:24.322
There's one in the hotel I was staying in.

11:27.269 --> 11:30.940
I lead a hard life,
I abuse alcohol. I'm DT'ing.

11:31.040 --> 11:34.710
I just need to get it out
of my system before we start.

11:34.810 --> 11:38.180
- DT'ing?
- Yeah, I use it sometimes.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.821
It's an altered state for the horror.

11:43.335 --> 11:44.359
Will you be alright?

11:44.459 --> 11:46.372
It's just mild. I just need to shake it off.

11:46.472 --> 11:49.827
- You are going to be able to do this?
- Oh, for Christ's sake!

11:51.961 --> 11:55.164
- Are you okay?
- I don't need your help.

15:33.065 --> 15:35.706
Sophia. Oh, thank God.

15:49.765 --> 15:51.663
Have you told him about
the psychiatric hospital?

15:51.763 --> 15:53.075
I'm better.

15:53.175 --> 15:56.039
- You're vulnerable.
- No, I'm not.

15:56.605 --> 16:01.243
It was not doing anything, that's what
made me ill. I am doing something.

16:01.343 --> 16:04.752
- This stuff is black, it's against...
- So you believe it now?

16:05.147 --> 16:09.286
- I believe in God.
- What's that supposed to mean?

16:10.018 --> 16:12.455
Is this something Godly?

16:13.088 --> 16:14.892
Imagine it was Lottie.

16:17.058 --> 16:20.297
- What would you do?
- Not this.

16:27.369 --> 16:30.156
There's nothing wrong
with walking away from all of this.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.691
The kids miss you, they want to see you.

16:32.791 --> 16:35.912
Come home. We'll look after you.

16:36.012 --> 16:38.016
You're going to look after me?

16:40.115 --> 16:41.618
My baby sister?

16:42.118 --> 16:43.920
Don't be like that.

16:44.020 --> 16:46.122
You see that's the difference
between your home and mine.

16:46.222 --> 16:49.259
- Soph.
- You have two children.

16:51.026 --> 16:53.263
Two healthy fucking children.

16:55.497 --> 16:57.105
I have a hole.

16:59.968 --> 17:02.239
And tell me where is God?

17:04.306 --> 17:06.376
Where is his goodness?

17:06.808 --> 17:08.432
Sophia...

17:10.311 --> 17:12.382
I am going to do this.

17:13.147 --> 17:14.823
- It doesn't matter...
- I'm sorry.

17:14.923 --> 17:17.755
It doesn't matter if it's right or wrong.

17:19.588 --> 17:22.108
You're going to keep away from me.

17:28.864 --> 17:30.734
Stay away.

17:32.418 --> 17:34.254
Is that understood?

19:00.922 --> 19:02.793
Are you done?

19:03.425 --> 19:04.995
Yeah.

19:22.043 --> 19:23.881
Did you just lie?

19:24.413 --> 19:25.716
No.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.470
Look.

19:29.317 --> 19:31.152
Do you speak German?

19:31.252 --> 19:33.389
I can make myself understood.

19:33.489 --> 19:35.364
A half truth is a lie.

19:35.464 --> 19:37.029
I didn't lie.

19:37.459 --> 19:41.297
I speak German. I didn't cause that.

19:41.397 --> 19:44.201
Everything has consequences in this.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.970
I didn't cause that.

19:47.236 --> 19:51.473
This has to be pure.
Not just your intention, but your drive.

19:51.573 --> 19:54.617
It can go so wrong.
There was always gonna be something.

19:54.717 --> 19:57.681
I'll help you with your German.
You just had to say.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.860
Go for a walk tomorrow
before we're sealed in, eh.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.857
It's gonna be months
before you see this again.

20:09.057 --> 20:10.628
Okay.

20:13.962 --> 20:15.799
What about you?

20:16.164 --> 20:18.601
Me? I'll be alright.

21:37.946 --> 21:40.350
This is your last chance to back out.

21:40.716 --> 21:44.660
Once I complete this circle, no one
can leave till the Invocation's done.

21:44.760 --> 21:49.226
Not for food, not for emergency,
not for anything.

21:51.660 --> 21:53.156
Seal it.

22:54.790 --> 22:58.159
- What the fuck are you doing in bed?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22:58.259 --> 23:02.798
- I... I slept in, I'm sorry.
- I don't give a toss. Downstairs!

23:07.669 --> 23:10.739
So magic squares.

23:10.839 --> 23:13.842
Essentially a grid where you
make word and number sequences...

23:13.942 --> 23:17.479
...that add up to one whole, backwards,
forwards, diagonally, etcetera.

23:17.579 --> 23:21.182
And used to change a state.
Don't look at me like that.

23:21.282 --> 23:24.953
Mr. Solomon, I'm not questioning you, but
let's just remember who's paying for this.

23:25.053 --> 23:28.057
I don't give a fuck about who's paying who.

23:28.524 --> 23:30.542
I don't give a fuck about the money!

23:30.642 --> 23:33.046
Eighty thousand pounds is a lot of money.

23:34.930 --> 23:36.832
Do you know the ritual?

23:36.932 --> 23:39.234
Shall I leave you to do it?

23:39.334 --> 23:42.037
You will not argue back!

23:42.137 --> 23:44.373
I'm giving you what you want.

23:44.473 --> 23:46.498
I see it burn in your fucking eyes.

23:46.598 --> 23:50.463
You agreed to do whatever I said.
I asked you.

23:50.563 --> 23:54.282
- I know. I was just...
- You had the chance to back out yesterday.

23:54.542 --> 23:57.252
- But the house has been sealed.
- I'm not backing out.

23:57.352 --> 23:59.356
Well, what are you doing?

23:59.788 --> 24:01.710
I just want this to work.

24:01.810 --> 24:04.493
And it's gonna work
with posh little you in charge?

24:04.593 --> 24:06.163
No.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.036
Eat this.

24:15.236 --> 24:19.675
- It's a toadstool.
- Have you been listening? Take it.

24:19.775 --> 24:24.047
Do the ritual. Talk to your Guardian Angel.
Talk to your child.

24:33.829 --> 24:35.358
Good.

24:36.825 --> 24:38.861
What will it do?

24:39.460 --> 24:42.379
You've been cleansed ritually,
you're gonna be cleansed physically.

24:43.364 --> 24:45.333
Is it going to be horrible?

24:45.433 --> 24:47.004
Yep.

25:58.574 --> 26:00.642
The circle is a paradox.

26:00.742 --> 26:04.312
No beginning and no end, but bounded.

26:04.412 --> 26:08.376
In each circle
there are four essential phases.

26:08.476 --> 26:11.820
We consecrate the circles,
open the chamber...

26:11.920 --> 26:15.056
...with the magic squares, pass through.

26:15.156 --> 26:19.060
Five circles, five elements, five realms.

26:19.160 --> 26:22.598
Now, the Abramelin is essentially a journey.

26:23.148 --> 26:25.601
That's a... that's a poor metaphor.

26:25.701 --> 26:28.170
That is, but it will do for now.

26:28.670 --> 26:32.007
This circle, this is the Chamber of Effect.

26:32.107 --> 26:34.967
Element of Wood, where we seal
our vessel from the world...

26:35.207 --> 26:37.647
...make it safe against attack.

26:38.196 --> 26:41.583
This one, the Chamber of the Song.

26:41.683 --> 26:45.320
We push off into the void, on our journey.

26:45.420 --> 26:47.243
Element of fire.

26:48.356 --> 26:50.393
The Blackness.

26:51.026 --> 26:54.664
The Boundless, where we sink into the abyss.

26:56.164 --> 26:58.034
The Tangible.

26:58.499 --> 27:00.543
Earth, metal, water.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.704
The cycle.

27:03.204 --> 27:06.808
Now this middle circle, this is nameless.

27:06.908 --> 27:08.710
This is where your angel will appear.

27:08.810 --> 27:12.413
You will ask your favor and I will ask mine.

27:12.513 --> 27:14.750
When will my angel appear?

27:15.150 --> 27:18.353
Well, we'll be invoking
the angel at every circle...

27:18.453 --> 27:22.023
...but each time we move on,
it will grow more powerful.

27:22.123 --> 27:26.027
This world will be merged
with other worlds, others will hear.

27:26.127 --> 27:28.096
When will the angel appear?

27:28.196 --> 27:30.966
It can appear at any time
from the first invocation.

27:31.066 --> 27:34.137
Most likely fourth or fifth circle.

27:37.706 --> 27:40.976
Triangle represents the divine order, three.

27:41.076 --> 27:44.545
A whole, divisible only by one, the Trinity.

27:44.645 --> 27:46.614
It's where you gain focus.

27:46.714 --> 27:48.551
Stop you going mad.

27:50.668 --> 27:52.904
This is the world of decay...

27:53.004 --> 27:55.841
...of death, brute fact.

27:56.291 --> 27:58.463
The square represents its form...

27:58.563 --> 28:01.764
...the number four,
square of two, a perfect number.

28:02.330 --> 28:05.266
This room is your urges, your baseness.

28:05.366 --> 28:08.405
It is where you will gain your steel.

28:09.938 --> 28:11.774
Break it.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.076
What does that phrase do?

28:15.176 --> 28:16.945
It's a transitional.

28:17.045 --> 28:19.247
It is, what does it transfer?

28:19.347 --> 28:23.218
Object to subject or subject to predicate.

28:23.318 --> 28:25.525
Good, now get the symbols tighter.

29:03.624 --> 29:05.510
Feel its mass...

29:06.420 --> 29:08.243
...its unmoving.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.953
Feel its coolness, its stillness.

29:14.903 --> 29:17.307
Did you get to the loo? No talking.

29:18.706 --> 29:23.378
For the next two days I'm gonna
unshackle the house from the world.

29:23.478 --> 29:25.748
You mustn't leave the circle.

29:26.381 --> 29:29.625
No food, no water.

29:29.985 --> 29:32.389
Focus on the stones I've given you.

29:33.321 --> 29:35.244
Fall into it.

29:35.523 --> 29:38.259
Swallow the pain and discomfort.

29:38.359 --> 29:42.213
On the third morning
we will break for water and food.

29:42.313 --> 29:45.367
Then we'll do the same thing
in the back two rooms.

29:45.833 --> 29:47.869
Six days.

29:51.239 --> 29:53.110
I'll start squares.

29:58.779 --> 30:01.618
"And may all my transgressions be washed."

30:02.650 --> 30:05.121
"And make me chaste and pure."

30:06.687 --> 30:08.891
"May my light be here now."

30:09.690 --> 30:13.496
"Guiding me, protecting me."

30:15.630 --> 30:18.485
"And may all my transgressions be washed."

30:18.866 --> 30:21.136
"And make me chaste and pure."

30:21.236 --> 30:23.105
"Protecting me."

30:23.905 --> 30:26.369
"May my light be here now."

30:26.942 --> 30:28.810
"Guiding me."

30:29.310 --> 30:31.547
"Protecting me."

30:32.097 --> 30:35.050
"And may all my transgressions be washed."

30:35.150 --> 30:37.245
"And make me chaste and pure."

31:22.230 --> 31:24.065
It's raining.

31:24.365 --> 31:26.369
Outside's an irrelevance.

31:27.902 --> 31:30.939
- Have you been hearing the dog?
- The dog?

31:31.039 --> 31:33.442
Yeah, there's a dog that barks at night.

31:34.009 --> 31:35.465
No.

31:36.877 --> 31:38.381
Maybe.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.349
When are we going to know that it's started?

31:44.449 --> 31:45.750
What do you mean?

31:45.850 --> 31:49.175
Well, how do we know
that something's happening?

31:49.275 --> 31:52.793
- That it's working? That it's not...
- That's why I was thinking about the dog.

31:52.893 --> 31:55.394
- We're miles from anywhere.
- A dog?

31:56.064 --> 31:57.567
Shit.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.783
- It's begun.
- What?

32:02.335 --> 32:06.148
It's a sign. Synchronicity,
that's a sign, that it's beginning.

32:07.108 --> 32:09.961
- That's it?
- That's how it starts.

32:10.061 --> 32:12.730
It's just a bird hitting against the window.

32:12.880 --> 32:14.751
A black bird.

32:18.953 --> 32:20.588
I can't see.

32:20.688 --> 32:23.876
It was black. It was.

32:34.502 --> 32:37.106
<i>The circles are fucking hard to master.</i>

32:40.975 --> 32:43.445
<i>Each one will take weeks.</i>

32:46.847 --> 32:49.802
All the other rituals are about you.

32:51.986 --> 32:54.223
<i>The shifting consciousness.</i>

32:55.590 --> 32:57.994
<i>Becoming one with the ceremony.</i>

33:00.561 --> 33:02.064
<i>Pure.</i>

33:09.237 --> 33:12.240
Look at me. Look at me.

33:12.340 --> 33:14.216
This is real.

33:14.736 --> 33:17.731
- Focus on me.
- I need sleep.

33:18.651 --> 33:20.482
Not yet.

33:54.182 --> 33:57.218
- It's part of the ritual.
- I don't do forgiveness.

33:57.318 --> 33:59.554
What the fuck did I say at the beginning?

33:59.654 --> 34:01.924
You've worked around other things.

34:02.957 --> 34:05.227
Can you work around this?

34:06.894 --> 34:09.364
Yeah, but it'll make life hard.

34:09.664 --> 34:12.268
I don't do forgiveness.

34:12.733 --> 34:14.657
I know a way around.

34:28.949 --> 34:31.552
- Drink it.
- But...

34:31.652 --> 34:34.322
Blood sacrifice, this is your choice.

34:35.790 --> 34:39.027
There are diseases. Hepatitis.

34:39.127 --> 34:41.869
- Can I do mine?
- No! Drink it!

34:41.969 --> 34:44.371
Look, it's starting to congeal!

34:56.494 --> 34:57.702
Good.

34:59.220 --> 35:01.084
Swallow it.

35:09.123 --> 35:11.959
Don't throw it up. Keep it down.

35:12.059 --> 35:14.261
Keep it down!

35:14.361 --> 35:16.232
Drink it.

35:18.833 --> 35:21.536
It's a blood sacrifice, this is your choice.

35:21.636 --> 35:23.134
But I did.

35:23.234 --> 35:27.095
No! Drink it! Look, it's starting to congeal!

37:03.103 --> 37:06.543
Why do you ask?
Does this, uh, question bother you?

37:07.675 --> 37:09.877
It's actually a bit of an ontological issue.

37:09.977 --> 37:12.014
You know what I mean.

37:13.848 --> 37:16.051
I would say no.

37:16.651 --> 37:20.555
We're not trying to hurt anyone,
but we're doing dark things.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.758
And would you do black magic?

37:23.458 --> 37:27.194
There's no point in going to the fair ground
if you don't go on any of the rides.

37:27.294 --> 37:29.132
Have you seen much?

37:31.432 --> 37:36.080
I've seen things. I've seen Gods, demons.

37:36.871 --> 37:39.338
I like Gods rain silver on me.

37:40.408 --> 37:43.751
And the dead and the damned.
Most of us are damned, you know.

37:43.851 --> 37:46.916
Have you seen anything that scared you?

37:47.415 --> 37:50.385
- It all scares me.
- Is that the point?

37:50.485 --> 37:52.720
No, the point is to know.

37:52.820 --> 37:54.823
To fucking know.

37:55.323 --> 37:59.660
And to see the architecture
and the levers to climb the mountain.

37:59.860 --> 38:02.749
- Power?
- Knowledge.

38:05.232 --> 38:07.891
Fucking stop this. It's time for bed.

38:10.170 --> 38:14.955
You'll see it soon enough and then you
will know. Then you will understand.

38:17.077 --> 38:20.826
You haven't been through my stuff
for any reason, have you?

38:21.281 --> 38:22.850
No.

38:22.950 --> 38:26.294
Something's missing.
Something that I can't...

38:26.394 --> 38:28.457
I'm not going through your stuff.

38:35.996 --> 38:37.800
It'll turn up.

38:57.117 --> 38:58.947
I hear it.

38:59.421 --> 39:01.223
What is it?

39:02.056 --> 39:04.092
That's us being noticed.

39:04.592 --> 39:06.861
Probably don't know what we are yet.

39:07.061 --> 39:09.096
Are you sure?

39:09.196 --> 39:10.598
It could be...

39:10.698 --> 39:12.634
What the fuck?

39:19.490 --> 39:23.330
We need to seal the circle.
Which is going to take a while.

39:23.911 --> 39:25.780
Was that real?

39:26.290 --> 39:29.946
We have to progress very carefully
from now on, everything tight.

39:43.530 --> 39:46.002
I'm on a beach by myself.

39:47.234 --> 39:49.038
Everything's dead.

39:50.204 --> 39:52.640
I walk towards a village...

39:52.940 --> 39:56.412
...past the bodies of my family and friends.

39:57.644 --> 39:59.680
I turn a corner...

40:00.180 --> 40:03.052
...and there's a weird
old woman standing there.

40:04.318 --> 40:08.725
She's holding the hand of my son, Jack.

40:10.157 --> 40:12.194
I can't see his face.

40:13.460 --> 40:15.330
He turns around...

40:16.090 --> 40:17.934
...and I wake up.

40:19.033 --> 40:21.703
Oh, it's just your mind working on things.

40:22.453 --> 40:24.855
This process is not about epiphanies.

40:24.955 --> 40:29.209
Dreams matter, mind.
And they're part of the architecture.

40:29.309 --> 40:34.162
I mean, you're going to get vivid dreams,
and deja vu, broken time.

40:34.882 --> 40:38.453
Do you want to know what I have
a recurring dream about at the moment?

40:38.553 --> 40:41.055
- That I own a moped.
- A what?

40:41.155 --> 40:44.392
Yeah, that I own a... I own a moped.

40:44.492 --> 40:46.109
That's the dream.

40:48.529 --> 40:51.167
You'd think in all this, wouldn't you?

40:57.772 --> 40:59.575
Fucking hell.

42:44.411 --> 42:46.448
I told you, we'd have to do it.

42:48.548 --> 42:50.052
Yeah.

42:53.187 --> 42:55.355
We want the ritual to work.

42:55.455 --> 42:57.892
You're not going to back out now, are you?

42:58.292 --> 43:00.577
- No.
- Good.

43:02.496 --> 43:06.335
- Do we need to go to the other room?
- No. We can do it here.

43:11.171 --> 43:13.007
Brush your hair.

43:13.407 --> 43:15.075
- I need...
- Be quick.

43:15.175 --> 43:18.118
Get changed into that T-shirt
and put some make up on.

43:18.218 --> 43:20.080
Make up?

43:20.180 --> 43:22.051
I'm just a man.

43:34.160 --> 43:35.942
Look at you.

43:37.664 --> 43:41.083
- Don't you need your books?
- No.

43:41.936 --> 43:45.374
- But isn't it part of...
- Do you know what you're fucking doing?

43:46.306 --> 43:48.142
- No.
- Well, shut up then!

43:48.242 --> 43:51.178
- Sorry.
- Sorry, Mr. Solomon.

43:51.278 --> 43:53.548
Sorry, Mr. Solomon.

43:53.648 --> 43:55.577
Take off your jeans.

44:09.897 --> 44:13.432
Now take off your T-shirt. Slowly.

44:23.077 --> 44:25.081
Put your hands in your knickers.

44:26.714 --> 44:28.785
You know, go on.

44:32.219 --> 44:34.290
Okay, take 'em off.

44:40.294 --> 44:43.499
Okay, turn around, bend over.

44:46.433 --> 44:49.505
Kneel down. Kneel down!

44:50.570 --> 44:52.441
Show me.

44:54.741 --> 44:56.746
Oh, fuck.

44:58.800 --> 45:00.682
Oh, fuck.

45:05.252 --> 45:07.287
Put your clothes back on.

45:07.387 --> 45:09.025
That wasn't sex magic.

45:09.125 --> 45:12.257
There's no sex magic in this fucking ritual.

45:12.526 --> 45:14.328
You've got to be pure.

45:14.628 --> 45:16.697
I had to get my mind.

45:16.797 --> 45:18.665
You shit.

45:18.765 --> 45:21.368
Don't you fucking talk to me like that.

45:21.468 --> 45:25.671
- Don't forget what I'm doing for you.
- Fuck you!

45:58.338 --> 46:02.278
You can serve yourself,
I'm not fucking hungry.

46:31.571 --> 46:34.208
But I told you, didn't I?
This is the way that it works.

46:34.308 --> 46:38.012
It's two, three passes at it.
It's a cycle, I said at the beginning.

46:38.112 --> 46:40.680
- I'm not doing it again.
- But you've got no choice.

46:40.780 --> 46:44.204
- I do. I'm going. This is shit.
- It is not shit!

46:44.304 --> 46:46.954
- I wish it were.
- I'm not doing it again. I'm fucking going.

46:47.054 --> 46:51.225
No, no, no! Don't open the door!
Don't cross the line, we'll be fucked.

46:51.725 --> 46:54.530
Cross the line, we'll be stuck here forever.

46:55.262 --> 46:57.686
Please, you don't... you just don't know.

46:59.533 --> 47:01.636
But nothing's happened.

47:02.036 --> 47:03.904
It has.

47:04.504 --> 47:06.508
You can feel it.

47:09.656 --> 47:11.479
I promise you...

47:11.979 --> 47:16.418
...I will let you talk to your child.
I... I promise you that.

47:17.918 --> 47:19.721
You better.

47:22.156 --> 47:24.160
You fucking better.

48:38.078 --> 48:39.601
Look.

48:40.867 --> 48:42.872
Could it have blown in?

48:44.170 --> 48:47.643
No. This is it. I told you.

49:14.601 --> 49:17.639
I can feel it. We're nearly there.

49:18.372 --> 49:22.209
We'll keep pushing. Seal the seventh chamber.

49:22.842 --> 49:24.913
Then we should really light up.

50:23.770 --> 50:26.174
The world isn't just science, is it?

50:27.273 --> 50:29.509
Is that what you're here to prove?

50:29.609 --> 50:33.214
I don't know. Possibly.

50:35.048 --> 50:37.884
Science describes the least of things.

50:37.984 --> 50:40.456
The least of what something is.

50:41.155 --> 50:43.591
Religion, magic.

50:44.391 --> 50:47.663
Bows to the endless
in everything, the mystery.

51:17.457 --> 51:19.695
I can't find the right bit.

51:22.696 --> 51:25.499
We're in the blackness
after the twelfth vessel.

51:47.987 --> 51:49.923
What's for tonight?

51:50.023 --> 51:52.060
Why don't you make it?

51:53.126 --> 51:54.962
What did you say?

51:55.492 --> 51:57.766
It's not fucking working!

52:01.268 --> 52:02.804
Well...

52:03.303 --> 52:05.171
Brilliant, like your style.

52:05.271 --> 52:08.475
You're a stupid, vain, idiotic man.

52:08.575 --> 52:12.379
"Vain, idiotic man." I like that.
Brilliant, that's told me...

52:12.479 --> 52:16.251
- Why the fuck isn't it working?
- I don't know!

52:16.683 --> 52:18.487
I think it's you.

52:19.286 --> 52:20.587
What do you mean?

52:20.687 --> 52:24.057
I don't think you've been telling me
the truth about why you're doing this.

52:24.157 --> 52:27.791
- I can just sense it.
- I've told you the truth.

52:27.891 --> 52:30.864
- Look at me.
- This is ridiculous. It's all shit.

52:30.964 --> 52:32.618
Look at me.

52:34.351 --> 52:37.405
Have you told me everything?

52:37.671 --> 52:41.750
- Yes.
- You bitch! You stupid bitch!

52:42.275 --> 52:46.147
Fucking bitch! Fucking tell me.

52:48.047 --> 52:50.366
I want vengeance.

52:54.070 --> 52:57.631
My seven-year-old child was murdered
by idiots doing a ritual.

52:57.731 --> 53:01.295
You lied to me. You fucking, stupid cow.

53:01.395 --> 53:05.465
- Would you have done it, if you'd known?
- Yes! I don't need you to be virtuous.

53:05.565 --> 53:08.768
I need you to be driven! You idiot!

53:08.868 --> 53:13.260
You're doing this for me! You're the focus!

53:13.740 --> 53:15.744
You're the conduit!

53:19.546 --> 53:23.919
- Are we going to stop?
- We can't stop! Ah, jeez.

53:25.552 --> 53:29.389
This... this... this whole fucking thing.

53:29.489 --> 53:32.127
Get out of my sight, you fucking cunt!

54:46.532 --> 54:48.970
Get up, we've got to do something.

54:53.607 --> 54:55.611
Have you been drinking?

54:56.393 --> 54:59.824
We've got to do a ritual.
You need to be anew.

55:02.315 --> 55:04.384
Can this wait till morning?

55:04.954 --> 55:07.053
No, we do it now.

55:07.153 --> 55:08.989
It won't be long.

55:09.389 --> 55:11.192
Stand in the water.

55:39.485 --> 55:41.323
It's cold.

55:47.093 --> 55:49.162
Strengthen her soul.

55:49.262 --> 55:52.231
Horace, Orpheus, Baal, Christ.

55:52.331 --> 55:54.736
Strengthen her soul.

55:55.234 --> 55:56.936
Strengthen her soul.

55:57.036 --> 56:01.076
Horace, Orpheus, Baal, Christ.

56:02.976 --> 56:05.078
I'm going to duck you under three times.

56:05.178 --> 56:08.383
- Can't this wait till morning?
- We need to do this.

56:17.791 --> 56:19.835
"Take this soul and find it new."

56:27.266 --> 56:29.871
"Make this soul clean and worthy."

56:37.661 --> 56:40.899
"Let her touch the void, the nothing."

59:24.543 --> 59:27.415
Don't look like that woman,
you've just been reborn.

59:30.016 --> 59:32.652
Well, I had to do it
to get the rite back on track.

59:32.752 --> 59:36.822
You are now one with the rite,
one with your intention, pure.

59:36.922 --> 59:40.393
You fucking cunt.
You nearly fucking killed me.

59:40.493 --> 59:43.677
You just crossed the boundary.
You touched eternity, the endless.

59:43.777 --> 59:47.667
- I didn't touch fucking anything.
- Well, we're back on track.

59:47.767 --> 59:49.876
You'll get your vengeance.
Everything points to it.

59:49.976 --> 59:52.707
Fucking make something happen.

59:55.174 --> 59:57.257
I need this!

01:00:02.982 --> 01:00:05.952
Jesus. Fucking Jesus.

01:00:06.552 --> 01:00:10.041
I think this is...
this is the ritual starting to work.

01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:14.393
That's the price I've got to pay...

01:00:14.493 --> 01:00:16.331
...for hurting you.

01:00:17.954 --> 01:00:20.642
Your fucking Guardian Angel.

01:00:20.967 --> 01:00:24.370
- What are we going to do with this?
- Have you got any bandages?

01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:28.274
- In the cupboard.
- Get... get... get the whiskey.

01:00:28.674 --> 01:00:30.211
Shit.

01:00:36.615 --> 01:00:40.019
- This is what we've got.
- Oh, that'll do. That'll do.

01:00:40.119 --> 01:00:42.889
- What should we do with this?
- Oh, the knife, was it clean?

01:00:42.989 --> 01:00:45.024
- I don't know.
- Let's hope.

01:00:45.124 --> 01:00:47.721
Let's just... just pull it out. Pull it out.

01:00:47.821 --> 01:00:49.929
- What?
- Just pull the fucking thing out.

01:00:50.029 --> 01:00:51.531
Shit.

01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:05.514
Shit.

01:01:08.147 --> 01:01:10.079
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:01:10.179 --> 01:01:12.078
What should I do?

01:01:12.178 --> 01:01:14.888
Just give... just give me a minute.

01:01:14.988 --> 01:01:18.293
Okay, you, you lost your child, go on.

01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:21.741
He was taken from a day care center.

01:01:22.661 --> 01:01:27.354
- Okay, is he... is he in prison? Oh, God.
- They never found anyone.

01:01:27.533 --> 01:01:29.917
You mothers and your children.

01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:33.473
It was three years ago.

01:01:34.473 --> 01:01:37.677
The case is closed, it's forgotten.

01:01:38.077 --> 01:01:40.148
And now you're here with me.

01:01:41.514 --> 01:01:43.850
It's less weird than you think.

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:47.053
You're not the first person I've
dealt with who's fucked off with God.

01:01:47.153 --> 01:01:48.872
You don't know me.

01:01:48.972 --> 01:01:52.525
- Right, it's time to sew me up.
- What?

01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:54.794
Just... just... just swab it
with the whiskey.

01:01:54.894 --> 01:01:56.383
Okay.

01:01:57.063 --> 01:01:59.516
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:02:00.834 --> 01:02:03.436
Fuck. Oh, just do it.

01:02:03.536 --> 01:02:05.515
I teach fucking RE.

01:02:05.615 --> 01:02:08.876
Fuck off, it's not brain surgery.

01:02:09.808 --> 01:02:12.011
So are you going to tell me now...

01:02:12.411 --> 01:02:14.370
...what you're going to ask for?

01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:16.525
Invisibility.

01:02:16.625 --> 01:02:18.017
Invisibility?

01:02:18.117 --> 01:02:20.353
Yeah, it's not what you think.

01:02:20.453 --> 01:02:22.658
I want to... I just want to disappear.

01:02:22.758 --> 01:02:25.776
Live the rest of my life away from the world.

01:02:26.609 --> 01:02:28.434
I've waited for you.

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:31.859
I want some quiet before the howl.

01:02:34.667 --> 01:02:38.004
Just don't go thinking this is us
fucking bonding or anything.

01:02:38.104 --> 01:02:40.908
We're not pals now there, you know that.

01:02:42.375 --> 01:02:45.211
Things will start to happen now.

01:02:45.311 --> 01:02:49.184
I will give you your vengeance,
I promise you.

01:05:11.754 --> 01:05:14.829
What do you think is going to happen
when you ask for your vengeance?

01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:18.233
They will die a horrible death...

01:05:19.798 --> 01:05:21.835
...and they will be damned.

01:05:22.535 --> 01:05:25.204
You don't think I had anything
to do with it, do you?

01:05:25.304 --> 01:05:27.976
It was teenagers playing with the occult.

01:05:29.408 --> 01:05:31.477
Damning teenagers.

01:05:31.977 --> 01:05:36.715
You could ask for so much more.
You know, personal things. Transformations.

01:05:36.815 --> 01:05:38.686
I'll do it my way.

01:05:40.653 --> 01:05:42.658
Well, they're damned anyway.

01:05:45.391 --> 01:05:47.452
Aren't we a pair?

01:05:48.494 --> 01:05:50.529
I'm not like you.

01:05:50.929 --> 01:05:53.999
You're just like me. Maybe worse.

01:05:54.099 --> 01:05:56.432
I am not like you.

01:05:56.532 --> 01:05:58.573
Look where you are.

01:06:02.875 --> 01:06:04.577
How are you doing?

01:06:04.677 --> 01:06:06.384
Yeah, I'm alright.

01:07:20.018 --> 01:07:21.854
Maybe we should stop.

01:07:21.954 --> 01:07:23.824
No, we can't.

01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:27.595
- But you're not well.
- I'm fucking fine!

01:07:29.528 --> 01:07:31.332
The power's off.

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:35.237
Well, we've got candles. Let's just...

01:07:35.337 --> 01:07:38.579
...let's just fucking try and reach the end.

01:07:41.039 --> 01:07:44.445
If we can't, we'll,
then we'll see where we are.

01:07:55.288 --> 01:07:57.292
It's three in line of nine.

01:07:59.858 --> 01:08:01.662
Or is it twelve?

01:08:03.062 --> 01:08:05.132
Which is it, Mr. Solomon?

01:08:09.134 --> 01:08:12.738
It's nine. Yeah, I...
yeah, I think it's nine.

01:08:52.877 --> 01:08:54.413
Mummy.

01:08:55.747 --> 01:08:57.317
Mummy.

01:09:00.586 --> 01:09:03.424
Mummy, please. Are you there?

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:09.608
Can you hear me?

01:09:19.004 --> 01:09:20.354
Help me.

01:09:22.174 --> 01:09:24.011
I'm here.

01:09:24.810 --> 01:09:26.846
I'm just in here.

01:09:29.346 --> 01:09:32.917
- I can hear you.
- It's not you.

01:09:33.018 --> 01:09:35.689
It is. You don't know what this is.

01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:38.359
You don't understand yet.

01:09:39.124 --> 01:09:41.196
It's not you, Jack.

01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:56.043
I've got to keep quiet, there's a dog.

01:09:56.642 --> 01:09:58.243
There's no dog.

01:09:58.343 --> 01:10:00.813
There is, you've heard it.

01:10:01.113 --> 01:10:03.582
You hear it at night.

01:10:04.082 --> 01:10:06.519
It's just a dog outside.

01:10:07.019 --> 01:10:10.057
Please, keep quiet. It might hear us.

01:10:12.325 --> 01:10:14.159
Where are we?

01:10:14.259 --> 01:10:16.130
We're in a house...

01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:19.099
...in the country...

01:10:20.032 --> 01:10:21.902
...in Wales.

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:24.639
I missed you, mummy.

01:10:26.338 --> 01:10:28.343
I missed you so much.

01:10:29.575 --> 01:10:31.446
Have you missed me?

01:10:33.559 --> 01:10:35.099
Yeah.

01:10:40.453 --> 01:10:43.658
Mummy, I need you to open the door.

01:10:48.694 --> 01:10:50.765
I know you're not him.

01:10:52.831 --> 01:10:55.636
Mummy, please. Something's in here.

01:10:56.602 --> 01:10:57.903
Open the door.

01:11:04.477 --> 01:11:05.744
No.

01:11:05.844 --> 01:11:08.413
Mummy, it's here. It's here.

01:11:08.513 --> 01:11:10.517
It's here with me.

01:11:10.883 --> 01:11:14.273
Mummy, please, please.
It's here, it's here with me.

01:11:14.373 --> 01:11:18.123
- I am going now, Jack.
- Mummy! Mummy! It's here, it's here.

01:11:18.223 --> 01:11:21.260
- I am not going to open the door!
- It's here with me!

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:23.596
Mummy, it's frightening.

01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:25.764
Open the door!

01:11:25.964 --> 01:11:28.035
Open the door!

01:11:38.894 --> 01:11:40.765
It's not your son.

01:11:42.147 --> 01:11:44.018
I know.

01:11:45.318 --> 01:11:47.322
But I heard his voice.

01:11:49.021 --> 01:11:51.091
Words are just a sound.

01:11:53.358 --> 01:11:55.896
This is the price of our rage.

01:11:57.763 --> 01:12:00.768
Embrace it, don't fear it.

01:12:04.169 --> 01:12:06.807
It's you and it's me.

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:14.000
Poor us.

01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:20.054
It's getting colder.

01:12:21.487 --> 01:12:23.524
We're in early March.

01:12:25.057 --> 01:12:27.025
Thought we're in May.

01:12:27.125 --> 01:12:28.974
No...

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:31.332
...I think it's March.

01:12:36.368 --> 01:12:38.405
Would you like something to eat?

01:12:39.137 --> 01:12:41.742
No, no. Not hungry.

01:12:43.208 --> 01:12:46.412
- Do you need to go to bed?
- Eh, no.

01:12:46.912 --> 01:12:48.783
No, got to keep going.

01:12:49.815 --> 01:12:51.419
I need that steel.

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:54.487
No surrender.

01:12:54.587 --> 01:12:56.455
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:12:56.555 --> 01:12:58.058
Okay.

01:15:23.001 --> 01:15:24.805
I'm a servant.

01:15:26.104 --> 01:15:27.941
I'm a warrior.

01:15:29.041 --> 01:15:31.509
- You are.
- Yeah.

01:15:31.609 --> 01:15:34.614
I... I...

01:15:36.148 --> 01:15:38.216
...shouted down his enemies.

01:15:38.516 --> 01:15:42.556
I... gloried in His creation.

01:15:45.723 --> 01:15:47.527
Demons fear me.

01:15:54.599 --> 01:15:56.671
I miss my sister.

01:16:02.307 --> 01:16:04.178
Oh, God.

01:16:10.315 --> 01:16:12.352
Is God here now?

01:16:16.554 --> 01:16:18.124
Sophia...

01:16:20.343 --> 01:16:21.887
I'm...

01:19:30.182 --> 01:19:32.852
Come on. Shit.

01:20:53.698 --> 01:20:56.701
Let someone be in. Let someone be in.

01:20:56.801 --> 01:20:58.872
Let someone be there.

01:21:21.893 --> 01:21:23.612
No.

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:25.263
No!

01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:40.276
Mummy...

01:25:41.264 --> 01:25:43.184
...open the door.

01:25:44.789 --> 01:25:46.359
No.

01:25:46.724 --> 01:25:48.927
Why weren't you there?

01:25:49.327 --> 01:25:52.486
You were meant to pick me up at 3:30.

01:25:54.499 --> 01:25:56.369
I'm sorry.

01:25:58.536 --> 01:26:00.406
I'm so sorry.

01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:05.178
Were you with that man?

01:26:09.581 --> 01:26:11.417
I love you.

01:26:14.536 --> 01:26:16.573
I love you so much.

01:26:20.408 --> 01:26:22.412
I miss you everyday.

01:26:24.996 --> 01:26:27.033
You are my whole world.

01:26:30.167 --> 01:26:32.606
I am so sorry.

01:26:36.941 --> 01:26:39.843
Are you asking me to forgive you?

01:26:42.347 --> 01:26:43.917
No.

01:26:47.285 --> 01:26:49.523
I'm going to get your killers.

01:26:52.106 --> 01:26:53.977
I'm going to get them.

01:26:55.827 --> 01:26:57.897
They're not my killers.

01:27:00.331 --> 01:27:02.066
I'm just some cunt...

01:27:02.166 --> 01:27:06.321
...using your son's voice to make you afraid.

01:27:08.573 --> 01:27:10.376
I know.

01:31:21.525 --> 01:31:25.058
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

01:31:28.165 --> 01:31:29.803
I am so sorry.

01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:58.174
So beautiful.

01:33:17.291 --> 01:33:19.127
I'm sorry.

01:33:23.214 --> 01:33:25.051
I'm so sorry.

01:33:46.838 --> 01:33:49.108
The favor I want is...

01:33:53.811 --> 01:33:56.049
The favor I want is...

01:34:09.093 --> 01:34:11.564
...I want the power to forgive.
