WEBVTT

00:02.955 --> 00:06.305
Tickets this way
for the Chatsworth Express.

00:06.515 --> 00:10.242
Come and watch pikeys
making a mess of the lives

00:10.682 --> 00:14.445
they were given by 'im upstairs.

00:14.485 --> 00:17.852
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:17.892 --> 00:19.106
Stay away!

00:19.146 --> 00:20.174
What sounds on earth

00:20.214 --> 00:22.076
could ever replace

00:22.116 --> 00:25.687
kids needing money
or wives in your face.

00:25.727 --> 00:28.295
Cos this, people reckon,
and me included,

00:28.335 --> 00:33.217
is why pubs and drugs
were kindly invented -

00:33.257 --> 00:36.923
to calm us all down
to stop us going mental.

00:36.963 --> 00:41.330
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:41.370 --> 00:43.549
We are worth every penny

00:43.589 --> 00:45.723
for grinding your axes.

00:45.763 --> 00:48.124
You shit on our heads...

00:48.164 --> 00:50.285
but you pay the taxes.

00:53.377 --> 00:56.407
Imagine a Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers,

00:56.447 --> 00:58.801
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer.

00:58.841 --> 01:02.682
Make poverty history,
cheaper drugs now!

01:02.722 --> 01:06.834
Make poverty history,
cheaper drugs now!

01:09.117 --> 01:11.756
Scatter. Party!

01:11.757 --> 01:18.157
www.addic7ed.com

01:18.592 --> 01:21.892
I once fell in love
with a man I'd never met.

01:21.902 --> 01:24.508
Actor. Movie star.

01:24.518 --> 01:27.006
Handsome thing.

01:27.046 --> 01:31.529
Dangerous lips. The promise of sin
in smouldering brown eyes.

01:31.569 --> 01:33.604
I wanted him.

01:33.644 --> 01:36.641
I wanted him so badly it hurt.

01:39.521 --> 01:43.300
Years later, I was working
in a bookshop and in he walks.

01:43.340 --> 01:45.929
Out of fantasy and into the flesh.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.229
And we talked. Laughed.

01:48.269 --> 01:51.451
But it wasn't too long before I
realised that the man I loved

01:51.461 --> 01:55.231
was capable only of loving himself.

01:55.271 --> 02:01.958
Meeting him ruined every
memory of him I'd ever held dear.

02:01.998 --> 02:05.736
I've never watched
a film of his since.

02:05.776 --> 02:10.616
The fantasy is always better
than the reality.

02:17.830 --> 02:23.100
Eamonn, Eamonn, yes, Eamonn! Oh, God
I'm coming. Oh, God, I'm coming.

02:23.140 --> 02:24.381
I'm coming, aaaah!

02:24.421 --> 02:25.871
Libby!

02:30.622 --> 02:34.514
She made this horrible
moaning noise, kept shouting,

02:34.554 --> 02:39.011
"Eamonn, Eamonn!" Then cried out
to God that she were coming.

02:39.051 --> 02:41.825
Can you imagine
how terrible that must be?

02:41.865 --> 02:43.411
A prisoner in your own body,

02:43.451 --> 02:46.850
your only escape -
your only release - in your dreams.

02:46.890 --> 02:49.879
That's all they are, babe, you know,
just dreams, there's nowt in 'em.

02:49.919 --> 02:52.643
I still dream of boffing Monica.

02:56.834 --> 02:57.985
Your nerves must be shot to pieces.

02:58.025 --> 03:00.956
Agh, he's not the only one
- look at that.

03:00.966 --> 03:03.116
I thought the poor
old love was a goner.

03:07.727 --> 03:09.069
Why don't you get yourself
down the pub?

03:11.765 --> 03:12.714
That's my drinking hand.

03:12.754 --> 03:15.399
That's my drinking hand. Which is
why you're only getting a tenner.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:26.680 --> 03:29.841
Micky - my sister, Tonya, she's going
to be staying here for a while.

03:29.881 --> 03:31.173
Didn't know you had a sister.

03:31.213 --> 03:34.042
Same dad, different mum.
Half sister.

03:34.082 --> 03:35.282
Which half?

03:37.542 --> 03:38.520
You're not 16 yet...

03:45.145 --> 03:49.593
OK, it isn't a massive problem,
so whatever you do keep calm, OK?

03:52.898 --> 03:54.616
Your dad's in the Jockey.

03:57.741 --> 03:59.138
Shit.

03:59.178 --> 04:00.805
You know his mistake, don't ya?

04:00.845 --> 04:02.639
Saying, "Keep calm".

04:02.679 --> 04:04.909
It's like saying to someone,
"Don't worry,"

04:04.949 --> 04:07.679
cos the first thing
you're going to do is worry, innit?

04:07.719 --> 04:09.235
So, Jamie's the looker,

04:09.275 --> 04:10.989
Shane's the thinker,

04:11.029 --> 04:13.435
that means you must be the gobshite.

04:20.325 --> 04:21.620
All right, Homer.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.434
Frank.

04:23.474 --> 04:24.742
Pint of Jesus juice.

04:27.717 --> 04:29.799
Yeah, all right, rack us up a slate.

04:33.345 --> 04:35.109
Don't know when you got out...

04:35.119 --> 04:36.188
Yesterday, it was in the paper.

04:38.202 --> 04:41.332
...but if you want to stay out, you'll
keep your distance from me and her,

04:41.372 --> 04:43.361
cos I'm just dying to see you
back inside

04:43.401 --> 04:47.579
and hearing you've been butt-fucked by
every window-licker on the side wing.

04:47.619 --> 04:50.485
And I'm waiting for the day when I
crack open the bubbly and tell our

04:50.525 --> 04:53.823
Tonya that our bastard of a father's
shuffled off his mortal coil.

04:54.363 --> 04:57.613
The kid's been through enough
since her mam died

04:57.653 --> 04:59.661
without you turning up
like a bad smell.

05:01.328 --> 05:05.132
So count this as a warning,
Daddy dearest,

05:05.172 --> 05:06.531
your last.

05:07.892 --> 05:09.166
Or what?

05:16.148 --> 05:17.443
Or that.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.013
APPLAUSE

05:29.054 --> 05:31.729
Dad's been warned but you know what
he's like, so if he comes near you...

05:31.739 --> 05:32.372
Call the Dibble.

05:32.412 --> 05:34.683
Call the Dibble.
No, no police. Not in here.

05:34.723 --> 05:37.510
Tell me, Mimi, any of the lads,
and we'll get him sorted.

05:37.550 --> 05:39.747
Look, if he bothers you again, yeah,

05:39.787 --> 05:40.584
it's concrete boots,

05:40.624 --> 05:43.460
quick ferry across the Mersey
and bye-bye, Daddy.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.489
Got family in the 'pool.
Half Scouse.

05:45.529 --> 05:47.509
Which half?

05:47.549 --> 05:50.956
He fucked my mam round, he fucked
your mam round. You owe him nothing.

05:57.110 --> 05:57.803
Where's Shane got to?

05:57.843 --> 05:59.714
Family business.

06:10.009 --> 06:13.290
If he's not back in time,
you're him, right?

06:13.330 --> 06:16.793
Leave the talking to me, sit there
and do your best to look 15.

06:16.833 --> 06:17.586
I am 15!

06:17.626 --> 06:19.360
Lippy off. And less tit.

06:23.406 --> 06:26.001
Don't worry, I'm not interested.

06:26.041 --> 06:29.413
In young girls - kids -
I mean, I do like 'em.

06:29.453 --> 06:32.883
You know what I mean, I love 'em.
Not in a paedo way. Just...

06:35.145 --> 06:37.685
Now remember - calm, collected,

06:37.725 --> 06:40.597
leave the talking to me.

06:51.970 --> 06:55.163
You've passed the CRB check
and the local authority

06:55.203 --> 06:58.543
are happy for Tonya to stay with
you and Shane for the time being.

06:58.553 --> 07:00.724
It's nice to see a family reunited.

07:00.764 --> 07:03.421
Just a shame about the circumstance.

07:03.431 --> 07:05.489
I just need to check
on a few details.

07:05.529 --> 07:08.256
Just you and Shane in residence?

07:08.296 --> 07:13.293
Just two of us but relatives
drop in all the time - busy house.

07:13.333 --> 07:16.532
But no overnight stays, Shane?
They'd need CRB clearance

07:16.572 --> 07:19.466
to be allowed to stay
overnight with a LAC.

07:19.506 --> 07:21.734
I wish you wouldn't call me that.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.163
Looked After Child.

07:23.203 --> 07:24.745
Sorry.

07:24.755 --> 07:27.281
We'll make sure no-one
stays while she's here.

07:27.321 --> 07:30.479
With a luck and a lot of help,
your dad should be able

07:30.489 --> 07:32.420
to sort himself out and you'll be
back with him before you know it.

07:32.460 --> 07:36.037
There was talk of Tonya getting
her own place, once she reaches 16.

07:36.077 --> 07:40.088
She'd need to get her son out of care
to be guaranteed council accommodation.

07:40.128 --> 07:42.861
I'm sure there's no need to remind
you of the history of neglect.

07:42.901 --> 07:44.421
Hardly neglect -

07:44.431 --> 07:47.349
her mum had died, her dad were
in prison and she had no cash.

07:47.389 --> 07:48.743
The baby was malnourished.

07:48.783 --> 07:51.126
So was she. She's 15.

07:51.166 --> 07:54.072
Which is why we've decided
to give her a second chance.

08:00.028 --> 08:02.136
Programmed to respond as
its real-life counterpart.

08:02.176 --> 08:03.810
GURGLING

08:03.820 --> 08:06.950
I did tell Tonya last time we met.

08:06.990 --> 08:09.291
There's a memory chip
that records everything.

08:09.331 --> 08:12.315
So if she keeps the doll happy,
she'll get her kid back?

08:12.355 --> 08:13.890
It'll go in her favour.

08:13.930 --> 08:16.006
You can't compare a baby
with a piece of plastic.

08:16.046 --> 08:18.379
If she loses her rag on this, there's no harm done.

08:18.419 --> 08:21.799
If she does the same with Enrico,
there's a court case and negligence

08:21.839 --> 08:25.430
allegations all round.
And we don't want that, do we?

08:25.470 --> 08:29.070
I think Tonya's been through
enough over the past few months.

08:35.562 --> 08:36.586
Leave him!

08:40.167 --> 08:41.748
GASPS

08:42.653 --> 08:44.592
Eddie, come on, come on, come on.

08:44.632 --> 08:46.960
Go on, one more.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.733
CHEERS OF ENCOURAGEMENT

08:49.773 --> 08:51.060
Go on, lad, one more!

08:51.100 --> 08:56.494
Another step, mate, go on.

08:56.534 --> 08:59.571
CHEERING

08:59.611 --> 08:59.844
Drinks on the house!

09:09.704 --> 09:11.911
Are you saying he grew new legs?

09:11.951 --> 09:14.373
What do you think he is,
a fuckin' newt?

09:14.413 --> 09:19.972
The trip to the shrine of St Boniface
the Second in France.

09:19.982 --> 09:21.074
Remember the whip-round we had?

09:22.803 --> 09:26.110
Boniface saw a vision
of the Virgin Mary.

09:26.150 --> 09:28.575
Ten years in a wheelchair,

09:28.615 --> 09:34.331
got to the holy grotto, took four men
to lower him into the waters

09:34.371 --> 09:39.552
and not one to get him out.
Cos he walked.

09:39.592 --> 09:40.976
Walked, Libby. Walked.

09:41.016 --> 09:45.321
Yeah, and his wheelchair had
a re-spray and new tyres.

09:45.361 --> 09:48.484
Mock all you like.
God works in mysterious ways.

09:48.524 --> 09:51.484
Get yourself over there, Patty,
and try it out.

09:51.524 --> 09:52.729
What do you make of that, Mum?

09:52.769 --> 09:56.783
When God first saw fit to confine me
to this contraption,

09:56.823 --> 10:01.047
I prayed every day, every night,
pleaded, begged, bargained for a way out.

10:01.087 --> 10:03.658
He wasn't listening. Home, Libby!

10:03.698 --> 10:05.628
Well, we've only just got here.

10:05.638 --> 10:08.960
There's online bingo.
I want to go home now.

10:11.439 --> 10:12.580
OK, I'll go home alone.

10:12.620 --> 10:18.395
If I'm mugged, raped, don't hold
yourself responsible.

10:18.435 --> 10:19.645
I'm perfectly f...

10:19.685 --> 10:21.084
Don't take it all to heart.

10:21.124 --> 10:23.694
She's got a lot to put up with,
stuck in that thing all day.

10:23.734 --> 10:25.949
Drive anyone round the bend.

10:25.989 --> 10:27.314
Yeah.

10:32.529 --> 10:33.714
Shit.

10:33.754 --> 10:34.624
Oh, my God.

10:34.664 --> 10:35.528
Get an ambulance.

10:35.568 --> 10:36.730
Is he dead?

10:36.770 --> 10:38.743
Oh, the irony.

10:41.185 --> 10:43.994
Play this right and you'll
be just down the road from me.

10:44.034 --> 10:47.703
I can help out with Enrico and
make sure Dad keeps his distance.

10:49.258 --> 10:50.680
Just going to the loo.

10:53.827 --> 10:54.985
She's a good kid.

10:55.025 --> 10:58.328
She's like her mam - have the
fillings out your back teeth

10:58.368 --> 11:00.705
before you realise
you got your gob open.

11:02.026 --> 11:03.300
DOOR SHUTS

11:07.958 --> 11:08.798
Fuck!

11:08.838 --> 11:10.687
Look after that till she gets back.

11:10.727 --> 11:12.197
I can't stay here all night.

11:12.237 --> 11:13.969
I've got a rugby team
booked in half an hour,

11:14.009 --> 11:16.056
I can hardly drag junior along.

11:17.096 --> 11:18.561
There's 30 quid in it for ya.

11:18.601 --> 11:21.149
I'll be back around midnight.
Don't wait up, bye.

11:21.189 --> 11:23.401
DOLL CRIES

11:28.352 --> 11:30.947
Mimi, Jamie said to come straight up.

11:30.987 --> 11:33.541
Course, come in, sit down. Drink?

11:36.085 --> 11:38.378
Vodka tonic?

11:38.418 --> 11:42.182
Going to be
one of those talks, is it?

11:42.222 --> 11:46.299
The pilgrimage you organised for
Steady Eddie? The fundraiser?

11:46.339 --> 11:48.552
What about it?

11:48.592 --> 11:50.853
If it isn't too much trouble...

11:50.893 --> 11:55.108
I mean, if it is, just let me know,
if I'm over stepping the mark.

12:04.530 --> 12:07.504
I've always believed that God had
a big black book and we each had

12:07.544 --> 12:12.626
a page, our whole lives mapped out
for us before we were even born.

12:12.666 --> 12:16.507
Never had you
marked down as a fatalist.

12:16.517 --> 12:20.781
I was taught to accept whatever life
threw at you and just get on with it.

12:20.821 --> 12:24.655
Seeing Eddie walk got me thinking.

12:24.695 --> 12:28.808
Maybe miracles don't just
happen to other people.

12:28.848 --> 12:31.497
Maybe we're due one?

12:31.537 --> 12:33.273
I know it's a long shot,

12:33.313 --> 12:38.118
but if there's even the remotest
possibility that it could work,

12:38.158 --> 12:41.483
then I owe it to Mum to try.

12:41.523 --> 12:45.091
You owe it to yourself. Looking
after her 24/7 can't be too easy.

12:45.101 --> 12:47.719
So you want to take her to France?

12:47.759 --> 12:51.080
We haven't two pennies to rub
together, so we'd need to do

12:51.120 --> 12:56.706
a fundraiser and, well, I just
wouldn't even know where to begin.

12:56.746 --> 12:59.235
So I was wondering...

12:59.275 --> 13:01.760
Would you consider helping me?

13:04.033 --> 13:05.011
I'd be honoured.

13:07.178 --> 13:11.773
Feck off. I hate the Frogs more
than I hate the feckin' l-talians.

13:11.813 --> 13:14.539
Mum!

13:14.579 --> 13:16.130
She doesn't want to go. She's
hardly one of God's chosen, is she?

13:16.170 --> 13:21.575
If she'd lived a few hundred years ago, she'd been
permanently strapped to a fucking ducking stool.

13:21.615 --> 13:23.228
It could work.

13:23.268 --> 13:23.967
Bollocks.

13:24.007 --> 13:25.459
Bollocks.
For once, I agree.

13:25.469 --> 13:28.594
Do it for me.
If ever I've meant more to you

13:28.634 --> 13:32.666
than just being a skivvy, someone to
feed and clothe you, to wipe your...

13:32.706 --> 13:34.592
Eating!

13:34.632 --> 13:37.754
Libby, God's not going to look
favourably on the likes of me.

13:37.794 --> 13:42.757
I was excommunicated the second
I fell in love with your father,

13:42.797 --> 13:46.741
he'll think of me as
nothing more than a sinner.

13:46.751 --> 13:50.951
I don't know, Steady Eddie was done
time and again for exposing himself.

13:50.991 --> 13:53.048
Used to flash at the nuns
up at St Morrissey's.

13:53.088 --> 13:55.222
God had him back up on
his feet in no time.

13:55.232 --> 13:57.039
And smited him with a coronary

13:57.079 --> 14:00.166
that would have stopped an
elephant in its tracks.

14:00.206 --> 14:05.733
OK, let's put the faith issue to
one side and look at this as a break.

14:05.773 --> 14:09.285
Two days in the glorious
French countryside -

14:09.325 --> 14:12.317
great hotel, waited on hand and foot.

14:12.357 --> 14:14.705
I never said I was a total

14:14.745 --> 14:16.145
non-believer.

14:16.185 --> 14:18.921
Once a Catholic...

14:23.065 --> 14:24.064
DOLL CRIES

14:24.104 --> 14:25.756
Micky,
it's 4 o'clock in the morning!

14:25.796 --> 14:26.980
What the fuck are you doin'?

14:27.020 --> 14:29.228
Doing a favour for Kelly.

14:29.268 --> 14:30.846
Well, Tonya really, but...

14:30.886 --> 14:32.437
Have you run through the checklist?

14:32.477 --> 14:33.193
Have you run through the checklist?
What?

14:33.233 --> 14:35.581
We've got these at the hospital.
Have you fed it?

14:35.621 --> 14:38.506
Fed, watered and bathed.

14:38.516 --> 14:40.169
Put it in the back of the car.

14:40.209 --> 14:41.664
The engine'll knock it out.

14:41.704 --> 14:44.499
Katie used to love that
when she were little.

14:44.539 --> 14:47.857
That's the theory.
Let us know how it goes.

14:47.897 --> 14:49.040
For fuck's sake Micky.

14:58.175 --> 14:59.585
Kel.

15:09.122 --> 15:10.328
Micky.

15:13.615 --> 15:14.968
DOLL CRIES

15:18.493 --> 15:21.315
You've woke him up now,
I only got him off half an hour ago.

15:21.355 --> 15:24.847
I can't take him,
I'm going to school.

15:24.887 --> 15:26.041
I don't give a
fuck where you're going.

15:26.081 --> 15:29.293
I don't give a fuck where you're going. I'll get the
piss ripped out of me if I turn up with that thing.

15:29.333 --> 15:30.539
Please, Kel.

15:30.579 --> 15:33.928
I didn't sign up for this. You said
you'd pick him up by midnight.

15:33.968 --> 15:36.863
Get to school, I'll sort it.

15:41.026 --> 15:44.350
I know it's a pain in the arse,
but you know how important this is.

15:44.390 --> 15:47.203
Can't you take it into work, get
one of the girls to look after it?

15:47.243 --> 15:50.811
Can't you take it into work, get one of the girls to look after it?
Tonya doesn't know how I earn a wage and I'd like to keep it that way.

15:50.821 --> 15:53.509
20 quid a day.

15:53.549 --> 15:55.586
30 and a 50 bonus
if baby's memory card

15:55.626 --> 15:58.638
reads like a dream
at the end of the week. Please.

15:58.678 --> 16:01.018
She's a pain in the arse.

16:01.058 --> 16:06.544
I know, but she's me sister.
She's family, Micky. I owe her.

16:06.584 --> 16:08.540
And I'll owe you. Big time.

16:08.580 --> 16:11.302
You're just using your feminine
wiles to tug on my heart strings.

16:11.342 --> 16:13.054
You're just using your feminine wiles to
tug on my heart strings. Is it working?

16:25.269 --> 16:27.169
I'm sorry, OK. I'm just tired.

16:35.823 --> 16:36.891
Will you lot keep it down?!

16:36.931 --> 16:39.746
No wonder he won't settle!

16:45.018 --> 16:48.175
Little tip for ya.
When my Rodney was about his age

16:48.215 --> 16:49.977
and wouldn't sleep, I used to hold

16:50.017 --> 16:53.316
a small pillow over his face.
Just till he nodded off, like.

16:53.356 --> 16:54.385
EVERYONE STOPS TALKING

16:58.680 --> 17:01.365
What, like I'm the only one?

17:13.387 --> 17:15.259
I get more out of him
than I ever thought possible.

17:15.299 --> 17:16.609
Grown quite attached.

17:16.650 --> 17:19.990
Don't tell madam that.
We'll never see her again.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.060
You'd be a nice dad.

17:22.099 --> 17:23.694
Trustworthy.

17:23.734 --> 17:27.531
What about you? You were thinking
about adopting a while back.

17:27.540 --> 17:29.790
Don't think I'd make a
very good parent, somehow.

17:29.830 --> 17:31.985
Never had much by
the way of example.

17:33.569 --> 17:35.319
What time do you call this?

17:35.359 --> 17:36.877
Went for a coffee with a mate,
got gabbing. Sorry.

17:36.917 --> 17:39.564
Went for a coffee with a mate, got gabbing. Sorry. The
social get wind of you treating this place like an hotel

17:39.604 --> 17:41.464
and you'll be back in care before
you know it.

17:45.775 --> 17:49.204
Your tea's burnt. I been calling you
but it goes straight to voicemail.

17:49.244 --> 17:50.948
It's like you're not interested.

17:50.988 --> 17:54.045
I can cope with it but what he's
going to make of it, God only knows.

17:54.085 --> 17:57.335
I can cope with it but what he's going to make
of it, God only knows. Micky, he's not real.

17:57.375 --> 17:58.907
It's what he represents.

17:58.947 --> 18:02.635
Enrico's in care for a reason.

18:02.675 --> 18:04.064
They don't think
you can look after him.

18:04.104 --> 18:06.077
They don't think you can look
after him. What if they're right?

18:12.057 --> 18:13.999
Come on, don't be
too hard on yourself.

18:14.039 --> 18:17.389
Your mum'd not long died,
you was on your own.

18:19.224 --> 18:20.859
I'm not now, am I.

18:20.899 --> 18:23.127
It's time I got me act together.

18:23.167 --> 18:25.311
Concentrated on getting my son back.

18:26.965 --> 18:29.014
I was going to go out.

18:29.054 --> 18:31.598
This bloke I've just hooked up with.

18:31.608 --> 18:33.113
Ah, he's gorgeous, Micky.

18:33.153 --> 18:35.048
Like something out of a boy-band.

18:35.058 --> 18:36.845
Yeah? Which one?

18:36.885 --> 18:37.869
Hey?

18:39.937 --> 18:42.394
I'll send him a text,
tell him it's over.

18:44.461 --> 18:46.455
The least you can do is
tell him to his face.

18:46.495 --> 18:47.986
I'll cover for you.

18:48.026 --> 18:49.339
Really? Go on.

18:51.404 --> 18:53.055
Do you want me to take Kanye?

18:53.095 --> 18:54.295
He's due a feed in an hour.

18:59.621 --> 19:02.717
Ladies and gents,
the star attraction's arrived.

19:02.757 --> 19:04.753
CHEERING

19:06.033 --> 19:08.207
We've got 500 quid to raise.

19:08.247 --> 19:10.873
So we'd better get started with
our slave for a day auction.

19:10.913 --> 19:12.882
Looking very smart, Carl.

19:12.922 --> 19:13.988
Off into town after this.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.093
On the pull?

19:15.103 --> 19:16.196
Might get lucky.

19:16.206 --> 19:19.683
If you don't and you come by my place
and the light's on, give us a knock.

19:19.723 --> 19:23.232
You are familiar with
the term MILF, Carl?

19:24.463 --> 19:25.839
L75.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.123
85.

19:31.163 --> 19:33.795
Any advance on 85?

19:33.835 --> 19:35.717
95.

19:38.386 --> 19:41.230
Once? Twice. Sold!

19:46.391 --> 19:49.066
5.50. Come on, ladies.

19:49.106 --> 19:56.074
Libby's assured me he's got a
crackin' bedside manner. 5.75? 5.60?

19:58.783 --> 20:00.026
On its own, number one.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.620
House! House!

20:01.630 --> 20:02.961
House!

20:16.626 --> 20:20.244
Once at 30. Any advance on 30?

20:22.027 --> 20:24.362
Get your fucking shirt off.

20:24.402 --> 20:26.375
35.

20:28.917 --> 20:29.508
40.

20:32.952 --> 20:36.925
45. Once. Twice...

20:36.965 --> 20:38.028
Sold.

20:51.141 --> 20:53.075
Hey.

20:59.226 --> 21:01.308
I've wanted this for years.

21:01.348 --> 21:03.478
The chance for Mum to be OK.

21:03.518 --> 21:05.500
What will I do, Frank?

21:05.540 --> 21:08.042
This is all I've ever known.

21:08.082 --> 21:09.527
If it work's, it's down to me

21:09.567 --> 21:11.697
and I don't know what to do
or how to do it.

21:11.737 --> 21:13.576
Yeah, just cos you want something,

21:13.616 --> 21:15.993
doesn't mean to say
that you're going to get it.

21:16.033 --> 21:18.297
I've been hankering for a threesome

21:18.337 --> 21:20.445
with Jordan and Katie Price
for donkey's years,

21:20.485 --> 21:22.438
can't see that happening.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.675
She's made every decision for me,

21:23.715 --> 21:25.997
decided every move
I've ever made and...

21:26.037 --> 21:29.206
It was you who decided
to take her to France.

21:29.246 --> 21:33.307
And if him upstairs actually
grants us a fucking miracle and

21:33.347 --> 21:36.482
she comes back under her own steam,
I want you doing cartwheels up that

21:36.492 --> 21:38.517
road because you'll be free!

21:40.100 --> 21:41.761
Free!

21:53.038 --> 21:54.316
We've reached the target!

21:54.356 --> 21:55.817
CHEERING

22:06.849 --> 22:08.123
KNOCK ON DOOR

22:09.573 --> 22:10.426
KNOCK ON DOOR

22:16.496 --> 22:17.291
Shane?

22:17.331 --> 22:18.309
Shane?
Patrick.

22:18.349 --> 22:20.372
Shane? Patrick. Shane.

22:20.412 --> 22:21.009
Micky.

22:21.049 --> 22:22.882
Micky.
Shane.

22:22.922 --> 22:23.452
Ricky?

22:23.492 --> 22:24.082
Julie.

22:24.122 --> 22:25.595
Kelly.

22:27.229 --> 22:29.538
Shit.

22:31.737 --> 22:33.557
Ton.

22:38.660 --> 22:40.116
Fuck!

22:42.798 --> 22:45.576
Please don't punish Tonya for
my mistake. She's got no-one.

22:45.616 --> 22:47.917
She's got me.
I thought she had you.

22:48.257 --> 22:50.350
Julie, I know you've got a job to do,

22:50.390 --> 22:52.252
and I think you do it brilliantly.

22:52.262 --> 22:55.752
But you must know that sometimes
things don't go to plan and...

22:55.792 --> 22:57.741
Can't you just turn a blind eye?

22:57.781 --> 23:00.548
This once?

23:00.588 --> 23:03.854
The only person who really suffers,
the only one being punished is Tonya.

23:03.894 --> 23:05.700
I'll help out, as well you know.

23:05.740 --> 23:09.219
Between the both of us we'll make
sure she's safe, never on her own.

23:09.259 --> 23:12.685
Come on. Everybody deserves a break.

23:12.725 --> 23:13.466
Just one.

23:13.506 --> 23:14.854
Please.

23:20.051 --> 23:24.557
Just one. If you fuck this up, she's
back in care. Have you got that?

23:24.597 --> 23:28.129
If my bosses found out
about your father-in-law...

23:29.759 --> 23:33.098
Is the flat still a possibility?

23:33.138 --> 23:35.919
As long as that memory card
reads like we need it to.

23:42.179 --> 23:43.680
Wagons roll.

23:48.888 --> 23:50.549
Don't come back with frogs' legs...

23:52.902 --> 23:54.987
Hey, get as much baccy as you can,

23:55.027 --> 23:58.048
it's dirt cheap in France.
Ram a few packs down your knickers.

23:58.088 --> 23:58.867
I'm not going.

24:00.413 --> 24:03.318
What?!

24:03.358 --> 24:05.783
You said I should start living,

24:05.823 --> 24:09.322
and I want to start
living so bad, Frank, so bad!

24:09.332 --> 24:11.622
What if I get there and it fails?

24:11.662 --> 24:15.265
What if God takes one look at her
and say, "No, not you. Not today."

24:15.305 --> 24:16.514
Libby!

24:16.554 --> 24:18.982
I couldn't stand it. Couldn't.

24:21.377 --> 24:24.899
Well, I want the old witch
out of here just as much as you do,

24:24.939 --> 24:28.057
but there's no way she's going
to get there on her own, is there?

24:28.097 --> 24:30.749
Which is why you're taking her.

24:30.789 --> 24:34.994
Oh, no!
No, no, she's your mum not mine.

24:35.034 --> 24:38.628
You can cope better
if it succeeds or fails.

24:38.668 --> 24:40.789
You don't give a shit either way.

24:42.339 --> 24:44.737
Your bag's packed.

24:44.777 --> 24:48.191
Look because of the effect she
has on you - on us - I want

24:48.231 --> 24:50.786
a miracle too,
but I want it for you.

24:50.826 --> 24:51.886
Then go.

24:51.926 --> 24:55.765
Because if you don't,
I'm out of here.

25:00.203 --> 25:03.584
This is madness and you know it.

25:03.594 --> 25:05.611
Oh, I disagree.

25:05.651 --> 25:11.552
I'd also like to prefix that by
saying, I do not believe in God.

25:11.592 --> 25:13.969
I am secular.

25:14.009 --> 25:17.251
Latin, meaning 'of the age'.
Are you truly of the age, Frank?

25:17.291 --> 25:20.960
Or could you just not be arsed aligning
yourself to something requiring an effort?

25:28.104 --> 25:29.952
I'll see you tonight.

25:29.992 --> 25:32.648
"Early night" she says.
"Finished with me fella," she says.

25:39.046 --> 25:43.148
The social worker's been. I can't
believe you've been so stupid.

25:43.188 --> 25:47.307
Stupid? I were that fucking stupid I
didn't even know I was having a baby.

25:47.347 --> 25:50.471
I went into hospital
thinking I had appendicitis.

25:50.481 --> 25:52.826
Can you believe that?

25:52.866 --> 25:55.339
The nurses laughed at me.

25:55.379 --> 25:56.499
Laughed.

26:01.414 --> 26:04.174
I want my son,

26:04.214 --> 26:05.830
and I don't.

26:05.870 --> 26:07.903
I miss him,

26:07.943 --> 26:10.701
and I can't stand to
have him anywhere near me.

26:13.563 --> 26:16.061
I love him...

26:16.101 --> 26:17.574
and I hate him.

26:19.397 --> 26:21.683
Maybe the best thing
would be to let him go.

26:25.152 --> 26:27.931
I don't know.

26:27.971 --> 26:30.618
What do I do?

26:30.658 --> 26:34.231
Tonya, I'm not that bright myself.

26:34.271 --> 26:35.823
You just need some help.

26:38.751 --> 26:40.229
Listen, what about the dad?

26:40.269 --> 26:42.549
My dad?
He's not allowed anywhere near me.

26:42.589 --> 26:45.211
No, not your dad, the baby's dad.

26:52.728 --> 26:56.035
Don't tell anyone, please.

26:56.075 --> 26:58.508
Don't tell Kelly.

26:58.548 --> 27:00.218
Please, Micky...

27:00.258 --> 27:02.764
for the baby's sake.

27:02.804 --> 27:03.970
For Enrico, please.

27:05.602 --> 27:07.024
OK, I won't.

27:20.436 --> 27:21.505
I'm sorry.

27:21.545 --> 27:23.848
So you should be, you daft sod.

27:25.413 --> 27:26.902
I'll go and get packing.

27:26.942 --> 27:28.593
You've had a reprieve.

27:28.633 --> 27:30.501
Julie's turned a blind eye.

27:30.541 --> 27:34.232
You'll be staying here and as soon
as you hit sixteen, the flat's yours.

27:35.835 --> 27:37.770
What about Enrico?

27:37.780 --> 27:41.455
The way Micky's looking after Kanye,
you'll have him back by the end of the week.

27:47.040 --> 27:50.999
Go and get showered.
You stink of fags and booze. Go on.

27:53.035 --> 27:55.276
BANGING ON DOOR

28:01.746 --> 28:03.338
Kelly.

28:06.290 --> 28:07.579
So where is she then?

28:07.619 --> 28:10.367
I told you to keep your distance.

28:10.377 --> 28:12.726
I'm getting a bit sick
of being told what to do.

28:12.766 --> 28:15.102
Now you're going to do some
listening. I'm here to stay,

28:15.142 --> 28:18.184
and I want to see my little girl.
She's the only family I've got

28:18.224 --> 28:21.022
apart from you and we all
know what you are, don't we?

28:21.062 --> 28:21.992
They're moving her.

28:22.032 --> 28:24.404
I'll find her.

28:24.444 --> 28:26.302
Just like I found her when they
moved her in with you,

28:26.342 --> 28:28.926
like I found her man,
just like I found your mam.

28:28.966 --> 28:31.734
If you fucking hurt her!

28:31.774 --> 28:33.630
What are you going to do?

28:33.670 --> 28:34.447
I'll tell 'em.

28:34.487 --> 28:35.574
You what?

28:35.614 --> 28:37.070
I'll tell 'em!

28:37.110 --> 28:41.102
You tell them and I'll tell them
it was down to you.

28:41.142 --> 28:43.681
Me, pissed, you climbing into bed.

28:43.721 --> 28:46.438
I didn't know who you
were until it was too late.

28:46.478 --> 28:49.743
Everyone knows what you are

28:49.783 --> 28:51.244
and what you do.

28:55.222 --> 28:57.281
Who do you reckon they'll believe?

29:12.731 --> 29:15.768
# Maybe I didn't treat you

29:19.163 --> 29:22.906
# Quite as good as I should have... #

29:25.911 --> 29:28.438

29:28.448 --> 29:29.933

29:29.973 --> 29:33.728
Mistress. Remember, I own you, slave.

29:33.768 --> 29:36.093
It was a charity auction.
I'll give you the cash back if...

29:36.133 --> 29:37.955
Trixie!

29:37.995 --> 29:41.409
Have you got any jobs for Carl?

29:41.449 --> 29:44.103
Ooh, have I!

29:44.143 --> 29:46.219
Skirtings, yeah?

29:59.507 --> 30:02.583
I was told I'd be staying in a hotel.

30:02.623 --> 30:05.375
Tell me there's been some
terrible mistake

30:05.415 --> 30:07.202
they've dropped us off
at the wrong place.

30:07.242 --> 30:09.277

30:21.478 --> 30:24.046

30:24.086 --> 30:26.503
It's packed to the rafters
with the faithful and deluded.

30:28.652 --> 30:31.943
We're sharing because they
were expecting Libby, not me.

30:31.983 --> 30:37.680
The only thing that got me here was the
thought of being neck-deep in a Jacuzzi!

30:37.720 --> 30:41.168
Remind me again why we're here?

30:41.208 --> 30:42.374
For your daughter.

30:44.387 --> 30:49.223
Look, you know and I know there's
about as much chance of you walking

30:49.263 --> 30:51.833
as there is me about
passing a liver function test.

30:51.873 --> 30:53.179
Oh, come on.

30:53.219 --> 30:56.114
Here, hold this.

31:02.273 --> 31:03.331
It's good for my cataracts.

31:03.371 --> 31:04.819
It's good for my cataracts.
You haven't got cataracts!

32:56.045 --> 32:58.013

32:59.624 --> 33:01.273
Been calling your mobile.

33:03.636 --> 33:05.536
I'm out of credit.

33:07.348 --> 33:11.616
She told me about the Soce.

33:11.626 --> 33:13.781
About her staying with us

33:13.821 --> 33:15.373
till she hits sixteen...

33:16.992 --> 33:18.471
Gets her own flat.

33:20.090 --> 33:23.651
That's on account of the good
job you've done with Kanye.

33:29.865 --> 33:31.833
You think it's a good idea?

33:33.803 --> 33:36.605
I mean...

33:36.645 --> 33:38.368
her looking after a kid?

33:39.963 --> 33:41.863
She's still a kid herself.

33:46.127 --> 33:46.980
Maybe...

33:48.636 --> 33:51.214
best thing would be for Enrico

33:51.254 --> 33:53.062
to stay in care

33:53.102 --> 33:57.347
until she feels
ready to look after him.

33:57.387 --> 34:00.100
Maybe the
best thing would be for her...

34:03.424 --> 34:06.650
maybe if she let him get adopted.

34:06.690 --> 34:08.139
Give him a chance.

34:21.824 --> 34:23.792
She said your dad...

34:27.589 --> 34:29.090
wasn't...

34:31.612 --> 34:33.034
proper with her.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.513

an early tea break...

36:16.633 --> 36:17.571
I'm fine, ta.

36:28.689 --> 36:30.065

36:34.308 --> 36:36.118
Drink it quick.

36:36.128 --> 36:37.755
Then leave.

36:41.172 --> 36:43.245
In fact,

36:43.285 --> 36:44.882
just get out.

36:44.922 --> 36:46.531
Is this a joke?

36:48.676 --> 36:50.803
I know what you did
to your daughters.

36:52.242 --> 36:53.493
I know what you are.

36:54.593 --> 36:56.402
Fuck you.

37:05.408 --> 37:08.524
Oh, Liam. Maybe we should wait.

doing the Can-Can?

37:10.974 --> 37:12.983
Oh, ye of little faith.

37:12.993 --> 37:14.260
I'm being cautious.

37:14.300 --> 37:16.696
There are many reasons
why him upstairs

37:16.706 --> 37:18.602
might not give us what we want.

37:18.642 --> 37:21.148
The most probable is that
there's no him upstairs.

37:21.188 --> 37:22.795
There's not even an upstairs.

37:22.835 --> 37:25.962
How do you get to be so cynical
at your age?

37:26.002 --> 37:27.864
How do you get to be
so gullible at yours?

37:27.904 --> 37:30.567
It's not gullibility,
it's desperation.

37:30.607 --> 37:33.095
I know you understand a lot of
things that you shouldn't.

37:33.135 --> 37:35.088
But I hope that's not one of them.

37:35.128 --> 37:37.097
Another thing to look forward to.

37:37.137 --> 37:39.554
If this doesn't work,
he'll think I'm an idiot.

37:41.448 --> 37:44.679
You're many things, but you're not
an idiot. Now grab the big 'un.

37:49.631 --> 37:54.639
You know Libby expects a miracle,
don't you?

37:54.679 --> 37:57.691
She won't get one. Stupid girl.

37:57.731 --> 38:03.527
Quite. Don't know why she thinks
as much of you as she does, y'know.

38:15.701 --> 38:20.369
Remember loving her.
I suppose I still do.

38:20.409 --> 38:21.764
When did you lose her?

38:21.804 --> 38:23.043
I was 12.

38:23.083 --> 38:24.472
Oh.

38:24.512 --> 38:27.390
The head master called me
to his office.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.690
Dad was there.

38:29.730 --> 38:31.493
He says...

38:31.533 --> 38:34.923
"Your mum's died."
Just like that.

38:34.963 --> 38:38.531
She missed out
on all those special years.

38:38.541 --> 38:41.352
Well, they weren't that special.

38:41.362 --> 38:43.580

and see me...

to make my dreams reality.

45:16.819 --> 45:19.276
'Couldn't bear the thought
of failing.'

45:19.316 --> 45:20.573
It was worth a try.

45:23.152 --> 45:27.031
'Couldn't bear to be reminded
of just how ordinary I am.'

45:29.085 --> 45:31.210
Ooh, if I were 10 years younger!

45:31.250 --> 45:35.806
'Give me fantasy over reality
any day.'

45:39.170 --> 45:41.716
This wedding certificate.
It's, er... fake.

45:41.756 --> 45:44.146
And the kids!
They're all bastards!

45:44.186 --> 45:45.556
Tell me something I don't know.

45:45.596 --> 45:47.290
We're getting married at 4pm today

45:47.330 --> 45:49.406
whether you like it or not.

45:50.458 --> 45:51.111
Fuck!

45:51.151 --> 45:52.086
Fuck!
Gary.

45:52.126 --> 45:55.834
I think I've fucked it up
by telling a few lies.

45:55.874 --> 45:57.655
I'm shagging Paddy Maguire.

45:57.665 --> 46:00.060
You stole my savings.
How dare you!

46:00.100 --> 46:01.482
Fucking hell!

46:02.908 --> 46:04.614
I'm not the only one
with a secret.

46:06.437 --> 46:08.428
I'm sorry I couldn't make it work.
