00:25.193 --> 00:26.683
No matter what it takes,

I know you'll find a way
to kill Rumplestiltskin.

00:29.947 --> 00:32.939
Mr. Smee, what news of
the day's catch?

00:33.034 --> 00:34.444
The boy we yanked from the sea?

00:34.535 --> 00:38.278
He's still asleep. A bit waterlogged,
and smells of catfish, but he'll live.

00:38.956 --> 00:41.618
Where do you suppose he came from?
Hmm?

00:42.585 --> 00:44.200
Not many other ships in the area,

00:44.295 --> 00:48.129
and his clothes
are certainly not of this land.

00:48.257 --> 00:50.634
What if the boy belongs to him?

00:51.260 --> 00:52.966
The ones he kidnaps
from the other world.

00:53.095 --> 00:54.551
I'd bet my rations on it.

00:54.639 --> 00:57.881
Indeed. But could we be so lucky?

00:57.975 --> 00:59.226
Lucky?

00:59.310 --> 01:02.723
He'll be looking for us.
He knows this land better than we do.

01:02.813 --> 01:07.807
Mr. Smee, are you not a connoisseur of
rare and valuable objects?

01:09.487 --> 01:11.648
If we return the boy to him,

01:11.739 --> 01:15.152
it could be the very key
to our survival in Neverland.

in a land cursed with magic.

they've found paradise

on Neverland's magic.

01:38.808 --> 01:41.515

Well, aren't you quite the hero?

01:50.152 --> 01:52.279
What would you know
about that, pirate?

from the curse of the mermaids.

and tore apart my family.

He's a coward.

I'm to stay away from him,

so I'm spending some time
with my grandson instead.

04:54.879 --> 04:57.120

05:17.109 --> 05:18.098

if there's one thing
I want more than my revenge,

09:18.976 --> 09:20.011
it's my life.

I can do is slow it down,

the sooner they leave us alone!

Let's take him back to Granny's
and do it there.

13:57.462 --> 14:00.169
SNEEZY: Hey! (SCOFFS) Hey, guys.

14:00.298 --> 14:02.129
If I don't have a family, will I still die?

14:02.217 --> 14:04.549
I really don't think it's necessary...

14:05.929 --> 14:06.918
(DOOR BELLS JINGLE)

14:07.014 --> 14:09.505
I asked her to make a second dose.

14:09.599 --> 14:10.679
This is for you.

14:11.560 --> 14:13.175
And what am I supposed to do with that?

14:13.270 --> 14:16.353
Belle once helped remind me
of who I was.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.351
I've never forgotten.

14:18.442 --> 14:19.773
I wanna return the favor.

14:21.486 --> 14:24.193
Don't let her die as Lacey.

14:39.171 --> 14:40.206
Oh, that was nothing.

15:10.911 --> 15:13.493
(SEAGULLS CALLING)

15:15.332 --> 15:17.948
Your sea legs aren't bad
for a landlubber.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.954
Yeah, but I still get queasy.

15:20.045 --> 15:21.285
Oh, it'll pass.

15:21.379 --> 15:24.462
Just think of yourself
as an extension of the ship.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.798
Would you care
to try your hand at the helm?

15:28.678 --> 15:29.758
I know nothing of sailing.

15:29.846 --> 15:33.338
Oh, once you get your bearings,
it's as easy as pie.

15:33.433 --> 15:37.301
Now, the left side is called port.

15:37.395 --> 15:40.432
The right side is called starboard.

15:41.525 --> 15:45.518
Now, go two notches to port.

15:49.658 --> 15:50.647
(CHUCKLES)

15:50.742 --> 15:51.731
Well done, mate.

15:51.827 --> 15:54.318
You were born
with the sea in your blood.

15:54.412 --> 15:55.401
Thanks.

15:57.749 --> 15:59.785
You spoke of your mother's fate,

15:59.876 --> 16:02.788
but your father, what became of him?

16:03.964 --> 16:05.750
You say he left you?

16:07.050 --> 16:08.586
It's a long story.

16:08.677 --> 16:10.338
It's one that I know well.

16:10.428 --> 16:14.012
When I was a boy,
my father and I boarded a ship

16:14.099 --> 16:15.885
with plans to travel the realms.

16:17.144 --> 16:20.227
One morning, I awoke and he was gone.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.563
Turned out he was a fugitive.

16:25.944 --> 16:28.731
He had fled in the middle of the night
to avoid capture.

16:29.948 --> 16:30.937
He abandoned you?

16:31.741 --> 16:34.574
Aye, that he did.

16:39.082 --> 16:41.539
If I tell you something,
will you promise not to tell the crew?

16:41.626 --> 16:43.662
They might become frightened.

16:44.921 --> 16:46.377
My father,

16:46.464 --> 16:50.833
the reason why I don't speak of him
is because he's the Dark One.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.508
He once was a man.

16:52.596 --> 16:54.302
But when I got drafted to the Ogre Wars,

16:54.431 --> 16:56.262
he wanted to protect me,

16:56.391 --> 16:58.677
so he went in search of
the Dark One's dagger.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.759
And once he got it,

17:00.854 --> 17:03.937
he grew obsessed
with the power it gave him.

17:04.024 --> 17:06.140
He draws his power from a dagger?

17:06.234 --> 17:09.101
Yes. It's the only weapon
that can kill him.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.570
And the only thing
he truly cares about anymore.

17:15.076 --> 17:16.862
He chose it over me.

17:18.747 --> 17:20.908
My papa abandoned me, too.

17:38.225 --> 17:40.181
DAVID: So, tell me, Hook,

17:40.268 --> 17:42.350
if all this time
it's been about revenge for you,

17:42.437 --> 17:46.146
why is it suddenly so important to you
that you survive?

17:46.691 --> 17:50.229
I know what I'm fighting for, my family.
What are you fighting for?

17:50.320 --> 17:51.605
Myself.

17:51.696 --> 17:54.403
It's plenty of motivation,
I can assure you.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.461
What are you doing?
They've got the beans!

18:52.549 --> 18:54.961
Not all of them. I snagged one.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.427
Where're the rest?

18:56.511 --> 18:57.591
Who cares? All we need is one.

18:57.679 --> 19:01.012
Hey! Live to fight another day, mate.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.430
I'm not your mate.

19:15.447 --> 19:19.406
I can feel it. It's like the oxygen
is being sucked out of the air.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.450
Not the oxygen. The magic.

19:24.706 --> 19:25.866
There it is.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.749
Once it stops glowing,
its destruction is achieved.

19:29.836 --> 19:34.250
And then, well, then,
we'll see the real carnage.

19:34.424 --> 19:35.755
(HUMMING)

19:37.552 --> 19:39.884
I'll try to contain its energy
as long as I can.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.086
It won't be long.
They'll have the bean soon.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.216
Then we can get the hell out of here.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.678
Slowing the device,

19:47.687 --> 19:51.145
it's going to require
all the strength I have.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.227
You're not going with us, are you?

19:59.616 --> 20:03.780
When you said goodbye to Henry,
you were saying goodbye.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.744
He knows I love him, doesn't he?

20:09.834 --> 20:11.870
Regina, no.
There has got to be another way.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.417
You were right, you know.

20:13.505 --> 20:16.417
Everything that's happening,
it's my fault.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.797
I created this device.

20:19.594 --> 20:21.835
It's only fitting that it takes my life.

20:21.930 --> 20:24.137
What am I supposed to tell Henry?

20:25.433 --> 20:26.673
Tell him that in the end,

20:26.768 --> 20:29.885
it wasn't too late for me
to do the right thing.

as the Evil Queen,

We have a way out. We have to take it.

from being killed by the Wraith!

24:24.047 --> 24:25.378
What?

24:25.506 --> 24:26.541
We sent it through a portal.

24:26.674 --> 24:28.460
Why can't we do the same thing
with the self-destruct?

24:28.551 --> 24:30.291
Because we don't know
if it's gonna work.

24:30.386 --> 24:32.047
-It could.
-Yeah.

24:33.014 --> 24:35.380
It's too risky.

25:26.901 --> 25:28.437
You did that to Cora
because you had to.

25:28.528 --> 25:30.519
I did it because it was easy.

25:30.613 --> 25:32.604
It was a mistake.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.360
There were other paths.

I found this. On your desk.

27:44.121 --> 27:45.156
It's...

27:45.248 --> 27:48.240
It's my mother. How did you get it?

-How? (GRUNTS)

28:06.561 --> 28:07.767
Your father lied to you.

28:07.854 --> 28:10.186
He was too much of a coward
to tell you the truth.

28:10.273 --> 28:14.391
He tore her heart out
and crushed it in front of me.

28:15.528 --> 28:18.941
And I've spent every moment
since then wanting revenge.

28:20.449 --> 28:22.280
She abandoned me?

didn't regret leaving you, Baelfire.

when you were old enough.

so that I can make good on those plans.
