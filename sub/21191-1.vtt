00:55.162 --> 00:56.864
Eww.

00:58.699 --> 01:03.368
Fat face is here.

01:03.370 --> 01:04.535
Hey!

01:04.537 --> 01:06.638
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

01:06.640 --> 01:09.742
The teacher asked and
I answered.

01:09.744 --> 01:12.078
I'm new, I should have just
kept my mouth shut, okay?

01:12.080 --> 01:15.213
So, will you please forgive me?

01:15.215 --> 01:16.448
Here,

01:16.450 --> 01:17.716
we don't forgive.

01:17.718 --> 01:19.551
And we don't forget either.

01:19.553 --> 01:22.256
You must pay for what you did.

01:24.224 --> 01:28.429
You can run but you can't hide.

01:37.037 --> 01:38.502
Hey! Loser!

01:38.504 --> 01:40.507
Where are you going?

01:47.815 --> 01:53.017
I said, "Wait!"
Fucking bitch.

01:53.019 --> 01:55.320
Look, I'm sorry.

01:55.322 --> 01:57.156
Okay?

01:57.158 --> 02:00.561
You think that little "sorry" is going
to get you out of this?

02:13.773 --> 02:14.939
Uh-oh.

02:14.941 --> 02:16.843
Mallory.

02:17.744 --> 02:24.415
Aww, what are you gonna do now?

02:24.417 --> 02:26.717
What did I tell you?

02:26.719 --> 02:28.719
- Nenita.
- Shut up!

02:32.025 --> 02:34.558
I fucking hate you.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.228
What are you doing on
the ground?

02:36.230 --> 02:37.596
Now, get up!

02:37.598 --> 02:39.531
I ain't going to beat you
up like this.

02:39.533 --> 02:42.068
You don't have to do this.

02:42.070 --> 02:44.235
I said, On your feet, bitch!

02:44.237 --> 02:47.539
I don't want to fight you.

02:49.176 --> 02:51.646
You don't have a choice.

02:55.582 --> 03:00.951
Oh, I'm going to enjoy this.

03:00.953 --> 03:02.822
Hit me.

03:02.824 --> 03:05.356
You get the first punch in.

03:05.358 --> 03:07.594
Free of charge.

03:09.063 --> 03:12.296
I said, "Hit me!"

03:14.368 --> 03:16.070
You want to have another one?

03:18.237 --> 03:21.340
Please. I'm sorry that I told on you.
But I didn't know what else to do.

03:21.342 --> 03:24.342
I don't know any better. You
have to believe me, please.

03:24.344 --> 03:25.978
I swear to God,

03:25.980 --> 03:28.080
if you ever, EVER

03:28.082 --> 03:32.116
tell my name to anyone
ever again,

03:32.118 --> 03:34.318
I'll kill you.

03:34.320 --> 03:40.693
You hear me?

03:40.695 --> 03:44.866
- Can I have your phone, please?
- Yeah.

03:50.404 --> 03:51.503
Hey!

03:51.505 --> 03:53.539
Snitch.

03:53.541 --> 03:55.606
Look at me.

03:55.608 --> 03:58.009
It's okay, just look at me.

03:58.011 --> 04:01.479
I promise I won't hit
you again.

04:01.481 --> 04:04.184
I got to tell you one
more thing.

04:09.689 --> 04:12.193
You're pathetic.

04:21.134 --> 04:22.499
You know what?

04:22.501 --> 04:25.071
I got another surprise for you.

04:28.843 --> 04:32.343
Oh my goodness. -

04:32.345 --> 04:34.446
Posted it!

04:34.448 --> 04:37.048
And I tagged you.
Its on Facebook and Instagram.

04:37.050 --> 04:40.619
- Oh my God. - Good isn't it?
- Wow.

04:40.621 --> 04:45.423
Look at that. Already got
20 views.

04:45.425 --> 04:49.293
Look at you, Ms. Popular.

04:49.295 --> 04:50.762
You should go back home.

04:50.764 --> 04:54.867
Go back to your fucking
Country! Go back to America.

04:54.869 --> 05:00.639
Aww. Look at that.
She's mad.

05:01.841 --> 05:04.108
What do you want to do now?

05:04.110 --> 05:06.480
Fucking kill yourself!

05:07.881 --> 05:11.350
I don't think anyone
would miss you.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.951
Let's go.

05:15.588 --> 05:18.156
YOU FUCKING BITCH!

05:20.360 --> 05:23.095
Stop! Stop!

05:43.850 --> 05:46.617
Uncle Tommy, please.
Say something.

05:46.619 --> 05:49.586
I don't even know what to say,
Mall.

05:49.588 --> 05:52.523
Don't you want to know what they
did to me before that though?

05:52.525 --> 05:55.360
Believe me. I heard
all about it.

05:55.362 --> 05:59.100
Sounds like you made some
real nice lunch buddies.

06:00.835 --> 06:03.600
This ain't the States, Mall.

06:03.602 --> 06:06.036
Things work differently
out here.

06:06.038 --> 06:10.341
God only knows what kind of pile
of shit you just stepped on.

06:21.554 --> 06:23.822
Congratulations.

06:23.824 --> 06:27.194
You've been officially kicked
out of school.

06:46.780 --> 06:50.482
I know it's tough without your
parents here and you're in a new country,

06:50.484 --> 06:56.021
but you need to figure out
how to fit in and fast.

06:56.023 --> 07:00.559
I think I'm going to get
some air.

07:00.561 --> 07:02.662
Excuse me.

07:34.694 --> 07:37.163
I hate this.

09:00.046 --> 09:04.482
We ran some further tests to make
sure there's no brain damage.

09:04.484 --> 09:07.087
Thank you, doctor.

09:24.472 --> 09:25.903
Mall.

09:25.905 --> 09:28.108
Uncle Tommy?

09:29.776 --> 09:34.613
You know you scared the
crap out of me.

09:34.615 --> 09:37.682
Shit.

09:40.554 --> 09:44.154
She must pay for her crime
and disrespect.

09:44.156 --> 09:51.196
Fine, plus two years in
Lattsan Correctional Facility.

09:51.198 --> 09:53.197
Two years?

09:53.199 --> 09:58.503
Mr. Rose. Two years is a very
short time for her crimes.

09:58.505 --> 10:04.942
With all do respect, your niece
nearly beat a girl to death.

10:04.944 --> 10:07.879
How much?

10:07.881 --> 10:09.981
She will pay.

10:09.983 --> 10:12.451
But she is not going home.

10:12.453 --> 10:15.419
They are very wealthy,
Mr. Davis.

10:15.421 --> 10:20.360
5 million, plus two years is
more than fair.

11:22.823 --> 11:24.625
All right.

11:26.458 --> 11:27.692
You ready?

11:27.694 --> 11:29.896
Do I have a choice?

11:32.030 --> 11:35.001
You can always become a
fugitive.

11:41.208 --> 11:43.010
Come on.

11:55.990 --> 12:00.457
- You must be Mallory.
- Yeah.

12:00.459 --> 12:04.229
Mr. Davis? We'll be right
back with you.

12:04.231 --> 12:07.001
Please follow me.

12:18.612 --> 12:20.445
Boxing.

12:20.447 --> 12:23.548
You'd be surprised at how
learning self defense can

12:23.550 --> 12:26.219
boost one's self confidence.
You should try it.

12:27.621 --> 12:30.557
Well at least
it's clean.

12:45.838 --> 12:48.242
Please have a seat.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.681
What a beautiful lady you are.

12:56.683 --> 13:00.421
I'm Jennifer. I'm the head
master here.

13:02.655 --> 13:05.690
A shy one?

13:05.692 --> 13:08.092
Something like that.

13:08.094 --> 13:10.094
I know this is required by the
law,

13:10.096 --> 13:14.499
but I like to keep things here
informal.

13:14.501 --> 13:20.004
I always tell all the parents,
well, in this case, a guardian,

13:20.006 --> 13:24.442
that don't look at this place
as a jail or anything,

13:24.444 --> 13:30.684
but more like a place that's designed
to help the troubled young ladies.

13:32.684 --> 13:35.320
Don't worry.

13:35.322 --> 13:39.756
There's nothing that make me more
pleasure than knowing that I can help.

13:39.758 --> 13:45.029
I think I should let you two
have your goodbyes.

13:45.031 --> 13:48.201
And Skye will see you guys out.

13:51.604 --> 13:53.971
All right.

14:02.949 --> 14:04.648
Thanks, again.

14:04.650 --> 14:06.252
Call you tomorrow.

14:19.565 --> 14:20.965
Well.

14:20.967 --> 14:24.001
I guess it's that time.

14:24.003 --> 14:25.903
Okay?

14:25.905 --> 14:28.005
I just want you to know,

14:28.007 --> 14:31.174
I'll be doing whatever it takes to get
you out of here as soon as possible.

14:31.176 --> 14:32.712
All right?

14:44.024 --> 14:46.224
Just promise me,
all right?

14:46.226 --> 14:51.296
Don't take shit from anyone.

14:51.298 --> 14:54.466
I'll come and visit you,
as soon as I can.

14:54.468 --> 14:55.669
Okay.

15:07.213 --> 15:09.550
Now you can come with us.

15:14.554 --> 15:17.256
I ain't go all day, babe.

15:54.426 --> 15:56.626
This is where I'm staying?

15:56.628 --> 15:57.894
Yep.

15:57.896 --> 15:59.632
Welcome home.

16:13.313 --> 16:16.947
Move. Keep walking.

16:16.949 --> 16:20.384
Don't do drugs. They're
really bad for you.

16:22.854 --> 16:25.755
Oh. And that happens all
the time here.

16:25.757 --> 16:27.759
Come on.

16:35.968 --> 16:37.500
There are some locals here now.

16:37.502 --> 16:42.407
Since the new laws, we just had
to condense.

16:42.409 --> 16:47.481
So its now a sort of holiday
assortment around here.

16:59.258 --> 17:02.427
Mmm. Fresh meat.

17:02.429 --> 17:04.461
Fuck off, Riza.

17:04.463 --> 17:07.798
Why? She's so cute...

17:07.800 --> 17:09.067
and delicious.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.703
I like her.

17:13.906 --> 17:15.472
Sorry. Riza.

17:15.473 --> 17:17.406
She's a resident bitch.

17:17.409 --> 17:21.645
- Could you please...
- Can I what?

17:21.646 --> 17:25.048
What the fuck are you going
to do about it? Newbie.

17:25.050 --> 17:27.285
Where the hell are you from?

17:27.287 --> 17:30.755
- Ginger land?
- Back the fuck up, bitch!

17:30.757 --> 17:33.694
Oh! You again.

17:34.860 --> 17:37.193
Baby.

17:37.195 --> 17:41.332
If only I had a dick,

17:41.334 --> 17:43.835
I would stick it in your ass.

17:43.837 --> 17:45.502
One more word.

17:45.504 --> 17:47.540
Later.

17:51.411 --> 17:53.810
Come this way.

17:53.812 --> 17:55.246
Thank you.

17:55.248 --> 17:58.385
Thank me again.
I'll kill you.

18:07.493 --> 18:09.562
This is you.

18:26.946 --> 18:28.112
Put this on.

18:28.114 --> 18:30.048
I'm going to take your clothes.

18:30.050 --> 18:32.386
You only wear the suit here.

18:34.087 --> 18:35.286
Now?

18:35.288 --> 18:37.488
No, next Thursday.

18:37.490 --> 18:39.960
Pants first,
then your top.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.703
No point in being shy.

18:57.243 --> 18:58.776
Your underwear next.

18:58.778 --> 19:02.449
You look like a crier.
Are you?

19:03.982 --> 19:05.516
No.

19:05.518 --> 19:08.355
Give them to me,
then take off your bra.

19:15.561 --> 19:20.733
Liar. You look like you're about
to cry right now.

19:26.371 --> 19:30.307
Just hurry up.

19:47.326 --> 19:52.596
Breakfast at 7:00, lunch at 12:00,
dinner is 5:00, lights out at 9:00.

19:52.598 --> 19:56.435
Check in with the registrar
tomorrow for your schedule, okay?

20:00.473 --> 20:03.540
Peace.

20:06.145 --> 20:09.415
So, what did you do?

20:10.850 --> 20:14.417
Hit someone.

20:14.419 --> 20:17.421
Did they die?

20:17.423 --> 20:21.893
Too bad.

20:21.895 --> 20:23.694
What did you do?

20:23.696 --> 20:26.399
None of your damn business.

20:28.734 --> 20:32.505
Well, welcome to
paradise.

20:36.709 --> 20:42.480
You will learn to think
they are cute.

20:50.589 --> 20:52.623
What does that mean?

20:52.625 --> 20:54.528
Chow time.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.567
I don't know where they got
this from,

21:03.569 --> 21:08.742
but I'm pretty sure it's
dog shit mixed with horse shit.

21:39.138 --> 21:41.538
What's her deal?

21:41.540 --> 21:44.942
Mmm. Her? She killed her
entire family.

21:44.944 --> 21:46.143
What?

21:46.145 --> 21:50.448
Yeah. When she was like 14,
and a cat.

21:50.450 --> 21:52.517
She's batshit.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.688
You don't want to face her.

21:56.222 --> 21:58.489
Face her where?

21:58.491 --> 22:00.391
In a fight night.

22:00.393 --> 22:01.491
What?

22:01.493 --> 22:03.527
Yeah. It's a big thing.

22:03.529 --> 22:06.329
Every fight has money on
the line.

22:06.331 --> 22:07.765
You know.

22:07.767 --> 22:11.603
This place ain't built for
rehabilitation.

22:11.605 --> 22:15.405
It was built for sex, fighting,
and gambling.

22:15.407 --> 22:17.340
The judge.
The schools.

22:17.342 --> 22:21.912
Pretty much everybody involved
gets a kick back.

22:21.914 --> 22:24.347
Corruption at it's finest.

22:24.349 --> 22:26.520
Cash rules, baby.

22:28.354 --> 22:29.753
That just sound like a...

22:29.755 --> 22:32.423
Conspiracy theory? Oh yeah.

22:32.425 --> 22:37.097
If you talk, they will kill you
and whoever you told.

22:51.344 --> 22:54.014
Fuck. She's coming.

23:03.423 --> 23:05.088
Well. Well.

23:05.090 --> 23:07.391
My new friend.

23:07.393 --> 23:09.792
What the fuck do you want?

23:09.794 --> 23:12.496
Don't be so rude.

23:12.498 --> 23:19.170
- I'm just introducing myself to the cute one.
- Back off.

23:19.172 --> 23:24.607
You know it turns me on when
you talk like that.

23:24.609 --> 23:27.109
So, Mallory,

23:27.111 --> 23:31.083
let me tell you how things
really work in here, okay?

23:32.151 --> 23:34.251
So, Kat...

23:34.253 --> 23:37.221
She's so nice. Cute.

23:37.223 --> 23:39.390
And the guards,

23:39.392 --> 23:42.828
they love fucking you bitches.

23:43.930 --> 23:48.566
Now, isn't that right, Katarina?

23:48.568 --> 23:50.233
What the fuck is your problem?

23:50.235 --> 23:54.238
Who wants to get thrown
in the hole?

23:54.240 --> 23:58.642
We were simply having a nice,
friendly discussion.

23:58.644 --> 24:00.280
That's all.

24:04.416 --> 24:06.218
Hey.

24:11.523 --> 24:15.728
I would suggest you stay
far away from her.

24:19.531 --> 24:23.334
Well it looks like you
two have a bit of a history.

24:23.336 --> 24:29.173
You said you have been in a
fight before, right?

24:29.175 --> 24:31.474
Not a fair one.

24:31.476 --> 24:35.748
Well, it might change now.

24:36.715 --> 24:39.548
No, I'm...

24:39.550 --> 24:41.751
I'm not a fighter.

24:41.753 --> 24:44.153
That's not how things work here.

24:44.155 --> 24:48.792
They will make you by doing all
kinds of nasty things.

24:48.794 --> 24:52.931
Things you don't wanna even
imagine.

24:56.802 --> 25:00.238
Or you can start using like her.

25:00.240 --> 25:03.840
Do that and you'll tune
out everything.

25:03.842 --> 25:07.944
But she's probably got AIDS
or something.

25:07.946 --> 25:11.117
You know, dirty needles and
stuff.

25:14.919 --> 25:16.553
I have to call my uncle.

25:16.555 --> 25:18.388
Where are the phones?

25:18.390 --> 25:20.590
In the visitation room.

25:20.592 --> 25:22.259
But, wait.

25:22.261 --> 25:26.596
- On the phone, they listen in.
- What?

25:26.598 --> 25:32.135
They will bury the both of you
and say it was an accident.

25:32.137 --> 25:33.872
Trust me.

25:53.693 --> 25:55.192
This is Tommy.

25:55.194 --> 25:56.661
I got to get out of here.

25:56.663 --> 25:58.695
Mall, what's going on?

25:58.697 --> 26:01.731
I Just...
I can't be here.

26:01.733 --> 26:04.667
Please get me out. I...

26:04.669 --> 26:06.202
It's... it's bad.

26:06.204 --> 26:08.506
No shit. You're locked up.

26:08.508 --> 26:09.941
What'd you expect?

26:09.943 --> 26:12.609
- Just, please.
- Are you okay?

26:12.611 --> 26:15.047
Did something happen to you?

26:16.615 --> 26:18.115
I'm just scared.

26:18.117 --> 26:20.550
Try to be strong, okay?

26:20.552 --> 26:22.321
Phone off!

26:23.455 --> 26:24.922
I gotta go.

26:24.924 --> 26:26.390
Time's up, huh?

26:26.392 --> 26:28.061
- Phone off!
- I'll talk to you later.

26:42.774 --> 26:45.172
Hi, Mallory.

26:45.174 --> 26:46.879
We forgot to have you sign in.

26:48.915 --> 26:51.384
Could you sign it right here?

26:57.655 --> 27:02.058
I can't read this.

27:02.060 --> 27:07.763
It's just to say that you are signed
in and already accounted for.

27:07.765 --> 27:09.432
I should talk to my uncle.

27:09.434 --> 27:12.002
And my lawyer.

27:12.004 --> 27:18.775
Well you can do that but unfortunately your
sentence can't start until you sign in.

27:18.777 --> 27:23.883
Which means you might have to
stay here one or two more months.

27:28.654 --> 27:32.323
Can I at least call my uncle?

27:32.325 --> 27:36.259
I do have a meeting that I have
to attend and I'm already late.

27:36.261 --> 27:38.796
I can promise you this is
not something bad.

27:38.798 --> 27:41.000
We wouldn't do anything funny.

27:44.502 --> 27:46.670
If you don't want to sign,
that's fine.

27:46.672 --> 27:50.807
But it means that your
sentence isn't counted yet.

27:50.809 --> 27:58.050
I can contact Mr. Davis to come here.
Hopefully he can come here, in a few weeks.

28:16.368 --> 28:18.602
Smart.

28:18.604 --> 28:20.471
How is everything?

28:20.473 --> 28:23.507
Is everything good?

28:23.509 --> 28:27.944
Some of the girls are a
little...

28:27.946 --> 28:31.682
aggressive.

28:31.684 --> 28:33.217
Yeah, I know.

28:33.219 --> 28:36.185
Many of those girls grow
up very poor.

28:36.187 --> 28:38.657
Many of them live on
the street.

28:40.626 --> 28:42.692
It does get better.

28:42.694 --> 28:47.730
Don't worry. I will tell the guard
to keep a close eye on you.

28:47.732 --> 28:51.667
We'll make sure that you
feel safe.

28:51.669 --> 28:54.206
Thank you.

29:11.723 --> 29:16.626
You're not going to get
much sleep tonight. If any.

29:16.628 --> 29:19.296
Just try though.

29:19.298 --> 29:25.335
Close your eyes and think of
Easter or ice cubes.

29:25.337 --> 29:27.770
You're really not helping.

29:27.772 --> 29:29.506
You want me to be honest?

29:29.508 --> 29:32.241
You ain't getting a wink.

29:32.243 --> 29:35.378
Oh, and don't cry.

29:35.380 --> 29:40.750
I wake really easy and you
don't want me to be grumpy.

29:40.752 --> 29:42.219
We're friends now.

29:42.221 --> 29:45.090
But I'd hate for that to change.

29:56.202 --> 29:58.701
You need a job.

29:58.703 --> 30:00.804
Do you have any skills?

30:00.806 --> 30:02.638
Or experience?

30:02.640 --> 30:07.611
Um, I worked retail?

30:07.613 --> 30:12.248
Okay. It's either clean toilets
or scrub floor.

30:12.250 --> 30:16.153
I'll scrub floors.

30:16.155 --> 30:18.391
Good call.

30:31.203 --> 30:33.506
Harder.

30:38.242 --> 30:40.679
Faster! Work faster.

30:44.415 --> 30:47.384
They put you here? All right.

30:47.386 --> 30:48.951
Well.

30:48.953 --> 30:51.688
This is simple work.

30:51.690 --> 30:54.559
Go clean this dirt now.

30:55.994 --> 30:58.996
You two. Give space.

30:58.998 --> 31:01.200
Now! Go clean.

31:03.868 --> 31:07.570
And faster!

31:07.572 --> 31:09.541
FASTER!

31:22.555 --> 31:23.921
Hey there, girl.

31:23.923 --> 31:25.788
I don't want any trouble.

31:25.790 --> 31:27.458
Chill.

31:27.460 --> 31:30.630
I just want you to transfer to
my cell. That's all.

31:32.665 --> 31:37.300
Come on.
It's much better.

31:37.302 --> 31:42.605
- Um...
- Um is not a word, is it?

31:42.607 --> 31:46.210
Come on.
Sleep with me.

31:46.212 --> 31:49.145
It'll be fun. I promise you.

31:49.147 --> 31:51.647
You do like fun.
Don't you?

31:51.649 --> 31:54.919
I'm fine where I am.
Thank you.

31:54.921 --> 31:57.755
I see what you're doing here.

31:57.757 --> 32:01.624
And I don't like it.

32:01.626 --> 32:02.692
Hey.

32:02.694 --> 32:04.560
Check this out.

32:06.063 --> 32:11.500
You can only hide behind
Kat so long, then you're mine.

32:11.502 --> 32:15.038
Damn it! Back!

32:15.040 --> 32:17.109
Back!

33:12.030 --> 33:14.901
It only gets worse.

33:45.063 --> 33:50.599
Why you think she got back eye.

34:19.464 --> 34:21.634
She did this?

34:25.536 --> 34:27.002
Oh, no she didn't.

34:27.004 --> 34:31.341
No, Kat.
Wait! Kat.

34:31.342 --> 34:33.877
- Please.
- You fucking bitch!

34:33.879 --> 34:36.645
You just gave yourself
a death sentence.

34:36.647 --> 34:38.415
Kat! No!

34:38.417 --> 34:40.949
Hey! Hey!

34:40.952 --> 34:42.554
Stop! Stop!

34:50.896 --> 34:54.764
Bring them to the cage.

34:54.766 --> 34:58.703
You're fucking next,
bitch!

35:30.267 --> 35:31.901
Oh my God! Kat!

35:31.903 --> 35:34.069
Kat! Kat!

35:34.071 --> 35:35.671
Oh my God!

35:35.673 --> 35:36.872
Oh my God!

35:36.874 --> 35:40.209
Oh, jeez.

35:40.211 --> 35:41.910
Easy.

35:41.912 --> 35:45.082
She just got her bell rung
a little bit.

35:45.084 --> 35:49.451
She needs help. This is crazy.

35:49.453 --> 35:53.658
No. This is Lattsan.

35:58.731 --> 36:05.200
If you think about telling
this to anyone,

36:05.202 --> 36:07.437
I'm going to kill you.

36:07.439 --> 36:08.839
Slowly...

36:08.841 --> 36:11.043
and painfully.

36:16.080 --> 36:20.850
I don't think you appreciate
what it is we're doing here.

36:20.852 --> 36:23.419
Let me teach you a some lesson.

36:23.421 --> 36:26.392
You. Up.

36:28.193 --> 36:30.194
Now, you up!

36:30.196 --> 36:32.431
Go get her up!

36:34.966 --> 36:37.834
You gonna need to learn
how to fight.

36:37.836 --> 36:41.069
She's a girl. This is
one-on-one.

36:41.071 --> 36:42.939
It's fair.

36:42.941 --> 36:44.443
Fight.

36:45.544 --> 36:50.613
You better put your arms up.

36:50.615 --> 36:53.015
Fight now!

36:53.017 --> 36:54.183
I say now!

37:08.434 --> 37:10.767
So what did we learn here?

37:10.769 --> 37:15.205
You should toughen up because I've
scheduled your first fight in two weeks.

37:15.207 --> 37:16.839
What?

37:16.841 --> 37:18.441
Oh yeah.

37:18.443 --> 37:20.044
You better get training.

37:29.153 --> 37:30.921
Hey.

37:30.923 --> 37:33.423
You touch me again and I'm
going to beat your ass off.

37:37.294 --> 37:40.729
Just like I thought.

38:05.423 --> 38:06.723
Hey.

38:06.725 --> 38:09.993
Don't bother me.

38:09.995 --> 38:15.165
Look, I want to be as tough as you,
and I'll do whatever it takes, okay?

38:15.167 --> 38:18.667
You're never going to be
tough enough.

38:18.669 --> 38:21.772
Well, how do you know?

38:21.774 --> 38:26.877
Well, other than seeing your ass
cry five times

38:26.879 --> 38:28.678
and getting beat to a pulp,

38:28.680 --> 38:31.381
I can see by looking into
your eyes.

38:31.383 --> 38:33.116
Well...

38:33.118 --> 38:37.319
You don't know me.

38:37.321 --> 38:38.721
I'll tell you what,

38:38.723 --> 38:40.825
you see those two dumbells?

38:44.796 --> 38:48.598
If you can hold them
out like this

38:48.600 --> 38:50.732
for 60 seconds,

38:50.734 --> 38:52.738
I'll train you.

38:55.540 --> 38:56.673
60 seconds?

38:56.675 --> 38:59.111
It's longer than you think.

39:09.019 --> 39:13.455
Let's see what you got, newbie.

39:25.202 --> 39:27.136
Less than 15.

39:27.138 --> 39:28.674
Goodbye.

40:07.745 --> 40:09.245
No phone.

40:09.247 --> 40:10.312
But I don't understand.

40:10.314 --> 40:12.647
No phone!

40:12.649 --> 40:14.787
It's okay.

40:30.734 --> 40:32.201
Now, make the call.

40:32.203 --> 40:36.272
But if you say anything that
she won't like,

40:36.274 --> 40:38.911
bad things will happen.

40:52.024 --> 40:52.854
Dial.

40:52.856 --> 40:55.793
I ain't going nowhere.

41:06.171 --> 41:08.604
Mallory, what the hell is going
on over there?

41:08.606 --> 41:11.540
I drove all the way down there during
visiting hours and they won't even let me in.

41:11.542 --> 41:12.810
Wait.

41:14.078 --> 41:15.712
They wouldn't let you in?

41:15.714 --> 41:18.147
Yeah, they said that you signed
away your visiting privileges

41:18.149 --> 41:20.683
because you didn't want
to see me. Is that true?

41:20.685 --> 41:22.087
What? I...

41:25.289 --> 41:27.390
I mean...

41:27.392 --> 41:32.562
Yeah, they have rules here.

41:32.564 --> 41:36.399
Look, I went down to the
embassy, I paid them a grip of loot,

41:36.401 --> 41:39.435
and they just keep giving me
the run around.

41:39.437 --> 41:41.803
What the hell is going on
down there?

41:41.805 --> 41:43.008
I'm...

41:47.178 --> 41:50.949
They're taking care of me.

41:53.318 --> 41:54.883
Can you not talk?

41:54.885 --> 41:56.688
I mean...

41:57.555 --> 41:59.288
I gotta go, my time is up.

41:59.290 --> 42:01.890
Mallory, look, just know that
I'm going to do whatever

42:01.892 --> 42:04.160
it takes to get you
out of there, okay?

42:09.801 --> 42:12.136
Come with me.

42:47.071 --> 42:49.238
Clothes off.

42:49.240 --> 42:52.542
What? Why?

42:52.544 --> 42:55.511
I said, strip!

42:55.513 --> 42:57.816
And that means now!

43:00.651 --> 43:03.287
He will hurt you if you won't.

43:12.830 --> 43:14.430
I told you so.

43:14.432 --> 43:16.234
STRIP!

43:41.359 --> 43:44.227
I know you've just been here
with us a short time,

43:44.229 --> 43:47.397
but I think you would've
learned it by now.

43:47.399 --> 43:48.830
What's going on?

43:48.832 --> 43:52.033
Your father is a very
wealthy man.

43:52.035 --> 43:54.238
We didn't ask for too much.

44:05.883 --> 44:07.149
No. Don't touch me.

44:07.151 --> 44:09.218
Stop it! Stop it!

44:09.220 --> 44:12.020
Get off of me! Get off of me!

44:12.022 --> 44:13.823
STOP! STOP!

44:17.294 --> 44:23.131
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

44:23.133 --> 44:26.102
Do you know why they're so happy
to do what I say?

44:26.104 --> 44:31.241
Because every time when
there is a girl like you,

44:31.243 --> 44:35.711
especially white bitch
like you here.

44:35.713 --> 44:38.984
I let them have some fun.

44:41.185 --> 44:44.187
How can you do this?

44:44.189 --> 44:46.156
Because I like it.

44:46.158 --> 44:48.426
And I like money.

44:51.129 --> 44:53.962
Your family doesn't want
to play ball,

44:53.964 --> 45:00.669
so I think after this maybe you
could help me convince them.

45:04.743 --> 45:09.245
No! I'll get you the money! I'll get
you the money! I'll get you the money!

45:09.247 --> 45:11.379
NO! NO! Please, NO!

45:11.381 --> 45:13.015
No! No! I'll get you the money!

45:13.017 --> 45:15.051
Oh, yes, you better
get me money!

45:15.053 --> 45:17.118
Or else this will happen
twice a week.

45:17.120 --> 45:19.850
No! No, please!

45:19.852 --> 45:20.784
Please!

45:36.593 --> 45:39.263
They got you good, didn't they?

45:42.031 --> 45:46.301
Let's think of this as a
friendly lesson.

45:46.303 --> 45:51.372
Trust me, it could get
way worse.

45:51.374 --> 45:52.975
Get her out.

45:58.481 --> 46:04.854
Hey.

46:17.767 --> 46:20.435
Now go clean your
fucking ass up.

46:20.437 --> 46:22.172
You're a mess.

46:37.419 --> 46:38.752
Hurry up, bitch!

46:38.754 --> 46:42.022
I ain't got all day.

47:08.484 --> 47:10.453
Hurry up, bitch!

47:38.580 --> 47:40.548
What the hell?

47:40.550 --> 47:43.220
You can't even fucking
kill yourself?

47:44.086 --> 47:48.923
You're a moron.

47:59.202 --> 48:01.234
Oh, God.

48:01.236 --> 48:04.540
You just can't get
anything right, can you?

48:07.577 --> 48:11.912
You know what the difference is
between Americans and Asians?

48:11.914 --> 48:14.915
America makes you weak.

48:14.917 --> 48:18.819
Too many luxuries just
make people soft.

48:18.821 --> 48:20.557
Like you.

48:22.158 --> 48:24.725
Aww, Mallory, baby.

48:24.727 --> 48:30.067
I was just trying to help you
because I care about you.

48:34.171 --> 48:36.270
Enough of that crying!

48:36.272 --> 48:40.674
You have to toughen up.

48:40.676 --> 48:42.609
It's for your own good.

48:42.611 --> 48:45.615
Only one week to go
before your big fight.

49:51.981 --> 49:56.687
Hey! Get out!
Get out!

49:59.589 --> 50:00.720
Harder.

50:00.722 --> 50:02.790
Punch harder!

50:02.792 --> 50:03.823
Harder.

50:03.825 --> 50:05.728
How bad do you want it?

50:06.796 --> 50:09.497
Throw your hip into it.

50:11.033 --> 50:12.569
Come on.
Continue.

50:13.937 --> 50:17.504
Good.

50:17.506 --> 50:18.906
Now.

50:18.908 --> 50:21.044
Put your gloves on.

50:22.845 --> 50:24.678
Why?

50:24.680 --> 50:27.548
Why do you think?

50:27.550 --> 50:29.519
Come on.

50:33.457 --> 50:37.725
When I punch, you block
or move, okay?

50:38.760 --> 50:40.093
Good.

50:40.095 --> 50:41.962
Now.

50:41.964 --> 50:43.533
You hit me.

50:46.736 --> 50:49.106
There you go.

50:51.673 --> 50:54.243
That's what I'm
talking about.

50:55.345 --> 50:57.678
Shit.

50:57.680 --> 51:01.018
You didn't think I was gonna let
you get away with it, huh?

51:06.155 --> 51:08.492
Thanks for helping me.

51:28.910 --> 51:33.013
What are you doing?

51:38.955 --> 51:41.258
Come with me.

51:55.203 --> 51:58.504
I didn't like girls either but

51:58.506 --> 52:03.579
sometimes you need to feel
something good in here.

53:46.749 --> 53:49.283
Feeling better?

53:49.285 --> 53:51.488
That was dirty.

53:53.055 --> 53:54.687
It was hot.

53:59.127 --> 54:01.298
I have a boyfriend, you know?

54:04.267 --> 54:06.200
We were gonna get married,

54:06.202 --> 54:09.472
and then have kids.

54:10.472 --> 54:13.540
I was young and stupid.

54:13.542 --> 54:17.243
His name was Michael.

54:17.245 --> 54:21.749
It was fucking stupid.

54:21.751 --> 54:25.285
I knew him only, like,
one week.

54:25.287 --> 54:27.854
And I would do
anything for him.

54:27.856 --> 54:29.991
I was walking towards
the security gate.

54:29.993 --> 54:35.296
I was sweating and they knew.

54:35.298 --> 54:38.466
I should have just ran off.

54:38.468 --> 54:44.774
All I was thinking was,
Michael asked me to do this.

54:46.408 --> 54:49.075
Sounds like Michael
is an asshole.

54:49.077 --> 54:50.977
He ruined my life.

54:50.979 --> 54:52.178
No.

54:52.180 --> 54:53.782
He didn't.

55:01.289 --> 55:02.589
Come on.

55:02.591 --> 55:04.625
You need to train some more.

55:04.627 --> 55:06.928
You need to toughen up.

55:06.930 --> 55:08.294
You're crazy.

55:08.296 --> 55:09.965
Duh!

55:12.100 --> 55:14.535
Must always keep pushing.

55:14.537 --> 55:16.203
Get stronger.

55:16.205 --> 55:17.705
Tougher.

55:17.707 --> 55:21.174
That's the only way how to
survive in here.

55:21.176 --> 55:24.278
Look, if you're gonna do
push-ups, do them right, okay?

55:24.280 --> 55:26.113
Kick you legs back.

55:26.115 --> 55:28.415
Get off you knees.

55:28.417 --> 55:31.553
Stop with that pussy
little girl crap.

57:06.649 --> 57:09.886
That's two minutes.
Impressive.

57:22.131 --> 57:24.834
Looking stronger.

57:27.937 --> 57:30.870
Well, I'm just following
your advice.

57:30.872 --> 57:33.774
Let's find out where
you're at, shall we?

57:33.776 --> 57:36.442
Let's have a little
exhibition round.

57:36.444 --> 57:40.450
- I'm not ready.
- We'll find out.

58:26.127 --> 58:27.895
Miss me?

58:27.897 --> 58:30.096
I'm going to enjoy this.

58:30.098 --> 58:33.299
Not as much as me.

58:33.301 --> 58:37.270
Play nice, girls.

58:37.272 --> 58:40.374
Old friend, huh?

58:40.376 --> 58:44.444
Besties.

58:44.446 --> 58:46.015
Fuck her up.

58:50.720 --> 58:55.388
Ready?

58:55.390 --> 58:59.125
Fight.

01:00:01.557 --> 01:00:05.160
You should have listened to me
when I told you to kill yourself.

01:01:09.091 --> 01:01:10.256
Bitch!

01:01:10.258 --> 01:01:12.160
Fight over!

01:01:15.464 --> 01:01:19.633
Winner!

01:01:34.783 --> 01:01:37.052
Mallory?

01:02:03.479 --> 01:02:08.615
The comments, the views, these
are more than we've ever gotten.

01:02:08.617 --> 01:02:10.750
Excuse me?

01:02:10.752 --> 01:02:12.519
They want more.

01:02:12.521 --> 01:02:15.258
The fans. They love you.

01:02:16.124 --> 01:02:18.725
You're such a bitch.

01:02:18.727 --> 01:02:24.198
I'm glad you know how quickly I
can have you killed.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:29.169
Because your uncle somehow
managed to pay somebody off,

01:02:29.171 --> 01:02:31.404
not the right person but, well,

01:02:31.406 --> 01:02:36.508
he's here and you're going
to visit him.

01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:39.546
Supervised, of course.

01:02:39.548 --> 01:02:42.383
If you say anything at all,

01:02:42.385 --> 01:02:47.723
I promise you he won't make it
back to his car.

01:02:50.825 --> 01:02:53.328
Easy as that.

01:03:10.613 --> 01:03:15.048
I don't drink.

01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:17.519
Take the fucking drink.

01:03:35.437 --> 01:03:39.238
So either your uncle pays the
right person

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:44.045
or I give you a chance to fight
Riza for your freedom.

01:03:51.419 --> 01:03:53.953
I can't beat her.

01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:58.361
Oh, yes you can.
And you will.

01:04:01.796 --> 01:04:05.568
If you win you can go free.

01:04:09.205 --> 01:04:11.140
Deal?

01:04:13.809 --> 01:04:16.944
Let me put it this way,

01:04:16.946 --> 01:04:20.314
you don't have a choice.

01:04:20.316 --> 01:04:22.484
Deal?

01:04:25.521 --> 01:04:27.923
Deal.

01:04:50.946 --> 01:04:54.814
Somebody gotcha, huh?

01:04:54.816 --> 01:04:56.352
Yeah. It's, uh...

01:04:58.754 --> 01:05:02.321
it's tough here, but... I...

01:05:02.323 --> 01:05:05.160
I think it's actually
helping me.

01:05:13.002 --> 01:05:16.602
Right.

01:05:16.604 --> 01:05:21.540
So I managed to get a hold of
an old buddy of mine.

01:05:21.542 --> 01:05:28.015
Type of guy who knows few people,
if you know what I mean?

01:05:28.017 --> 01:05:35.357
It's gonna cost a few bucks but I think we're
pretty close on getting you an appeal date.

01:05:40.062 --> 01:05:44.029
And, uh...

01:05:44.031 --> 01:05:45.765
Just so you know...

01:05:45.767 --> 01:05:48.104
I talked to your father.

01:05:49.537 --> 01:05:51.238
Why?

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:55.542
'Cause he's got enough
swing to get you out.

01:05:55.544 --> 01:05:58.779
That's why.

01:05:58.781 --> 01:06:03.383
Let's just say he wasn't too
keen on hearing my voice.

01:06:03.385 --> 01:06:06.453
- Are you surprised?
- No.

01:06:06.455 --> 01:06:08.988
'Cause he's an asshole.

01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:14.127
He always has been and he
always will be.

01:06:14.129 --> 01:06:19.064
And I think we both know that.

01:06:19.066 --> 01:06:21.066
I know it's tough.

01:06:21.068 --> 01:06:23.069
I've been there.

01:06:23.071 --> 01:06:25.638
And I know it sucks.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:28.441
So why don't you do
yourself a favor,

01:06:28.443 --> 01:06:35.048
pick up one of those phones over
there and give your dad a call.

01:06:35.050 --> 01:06:39.118
'Cause if he hears your voice and
you let him know what's going on,

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:44.256
- he might just be a little bit more inclined to help.
- No.

01:06:44.258 --> 01:06:47.963
- And don't ask me to do it again.
- Mall!

01:06:56.972 --> 01:06:58.870
You did the right thing.

01:06:58.872 --> 01:07:02.341
They would just drain him of the
money and it would get you nowhere.

01:07:02.343 --> 01:07:04.144
Unless you know the
right people.

01:07:04.146 --> 01:07:05.912
You're just totally fucked.

01:07:05.914 --> 01:07:07.312
Come on. Let's go.

01:07:07.314 --> 01:07:09.985
Did she tell me the truth?

01:07:11.118 --> 01:07:15.888
If I win, do I go free?

01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:20.828
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:25.332
Get her out of here.

01:07:25.334 --> 01:07:27.136
Go.

01:07:46.087 --> 01:07:49.589
I'm so sorry but your gym
privileges have been revoked.

01:07:49.591 --> 01:07:53.326
What? Excuse me, but
I have to train.

01:07:53.328 --> 01:07:55.531
Would you mind escorting
Mallory back to her room?

01:07:56.766 --> 01:07:58.465
What?

01:07:58.467 --> 01:08:00.401
Why?

01:08:00.403 --> 01:08:05.775
Think of it this way, it would
make even a greater victory. Go.

01:08:18.986 --> 01:08:20.586
I'm not surprised.

01:08:20.587 --> 01:08:22.956
She doesn't want you to win.

01:08:22.957 --> 01:08:27.095
Well, gym or no gym,
she's not gonna stop me.

01:08:32.667 --> 01:08:34.602
Out!

01:08:59.194 --> 01:09:02.828
I want you to kill her,
you understand?

01:09:02.830 --> 01:09:05.799
I want you to fucking rip
her head off.

01:09:05.801 --> 01:09:06.965
You hear me?

01:09:06.966 --> 01:09:10.970
I'm not deaf, so yeah.

01:09:10.971 --> 01:09:14.840
If you kill her, you go free.

01:09:14.841 --> 01:09:16.175
Oh really?

01:09:16.176 --> 01:09:19.145
Haven't you said that
last time?

01:09:19.147 --> 01:09:20.548
Swear on my life.

01:09:21.314 --> 01:09:23.417
Consider her dead.

01:09:59.254 --> 01:10:02.054
I just want to say, be careful.

01:10:02.056 --> 01:10:06.526
Well, I can take care of myself.

01:10:06.528 --> 01:10:10.063
It's different.

01:10:10.065 --> 01:10:11.697
Look.

01:10:11.699 --> 01:10:13.567
Just want to give you
a fair warning

01:10:13.569 --> 01:10:16.569
this thing might not go
as you planned.

01:10:16.571 --> 01:10:21.407
What are you trying to say?

01:10:21.409 --> 01:10:24.844
Just be prepared is all.

01:10:24.846 --> 01:10:27.848
I can beat her.

01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:29.514
No, you can't.

01:10:29.516 --> 01:10:32.854
You're stronger, yeah,
but your mind.

01:10:35.789 --> 01:10:39.826
The true strength comes
from here.

01:10:39.828 --> 01:10:41.193
What?

01:10:41.195 --> 01:10:42.461
Now you care?

01:10:42.463 --> 01:10:43.665
I don't care.

01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:47.434
I just don't want to see
you get killed.

01:10:47.436 --> 01:10:49.705
And what does it matter to you?

01:10:52.006 --> 01:10:53.909
I don't like her.

01:10:58.046 --> 01:11:02.115
Well...

01:11:02.117 --> 01:11:03.985
How do I beat her?

01:11:23.638 --> 01:11:28.840
No, no, no, no, no.
No food for her.

01:11:28.842 --> 01:11:30.242
Go.

01:11:30.244 --> 01:11:31.446
What?

01:11:32.312 --> 01:11:35.247
The hell?

01:11:38.119 --> 01:11:44.389
No sharing! Spit it out.

01:11:44.391 --> 01:11:46.894
Okay. Let's go.

01:12:15.656 --> 01:12:19.392
Are you gonna do what I think
you're gonna do?

01:12:19.394 --> 01:12:21.661
I don't have any other choice.

01:12:21.663 --> 01:12:23.630
Oh. That's disgusting.

01:12:23.632 --> 01:12:27.002
Well, I can't win on an
empty stomach.

01:12:30.372 --> 01:12:33.840
You've lost your mind.

01:12:33.842 --> 01:12:37.309
Yep.

01:12:43.217 --> 01:12:46.788
That's disgusting!

01:12:54.895 --> 01:12:56.664
Yum.

01:13:05.039 --> 01:13:07.139
God.

01:13:07.141 --> 01:13:09.576
Fuck! I got to get out of here.

01:13:09.578 --> 01:13:13.513
You and me both.

01:13:13.515 --> 01:13:15.816
Has anyone ever escaped?

01:13:15.818 --> 01:13:16.983
Here?

01:13:16.985 --> 01:13:18.518
No.

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:20.386
Have they tried?

01:13:20.388 --> 01:13:22.891
Yeah, but it's
impossible.

01:13:29.163 --> 01:13:31.363
I'm going to go for a gun.

01:13:31.365 --> 01:13:33.066
What?

01:13:33.068 --> 01:13:37.437
I'm going to go for one of those
motherfucker's guns.

01:13:37.439 --> 01:13:39.438
I'm going to demand they
let me out.

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:41.974
And if they don't, I'm gonna shoot
them in their fucking face,

01:13:41.976 --> 01:13:45.111
and anybody else who
stands in my way.

01:13:45.113 --> 01:13:47.112
You've gone mad.

01:13:47.114 --> 01:13:48.180
It's official.

01:13:48.182 --> 01:13:49.816
Well, I have to do something!

01:13:49.818 --> 01:13:52.986
God, I can't live like this.

01:13:52.988 --> 01:13:55.554
That's a perfect way to get
yourself killed.

01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:58.057
I don't care.

01:13:58.059 --> 01:14:00.527
I gotta get out of here.

01:14:00.529 --> 01:14:04.330
Somebody has to stop this
fucking madness!

01:14:04.332 --> 01:14:07.569
Chill out, all right?
You're fucking losing it!

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:10.897
Today is going to be a little
bit different than the last one.

01:15:10.899 --> 01:15:15.934
Only one of you will walk out
of here alive.

01:15:15.936 --> 01:15:16.868
Good luck.

01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:20.475
Maybe I see you later.

01:15:27.082 --> 01:15:30.015
Ready?

01:15:30.017 --> 01:15:31.986
Fight!

01:17:27.735 --> 01:17:29.938
Finish her!

01:17:43.351 --> 01:17:44.686
Kill me.

01:17:55.230 --> 01:17:58.563
This is bullshit!

01:17:58.565 --> 01:18:02.835
Let me go!

01:18:02.837 --> 01:18:06.438
If you want to go free,
finish her off.

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.144
Or I can make it a little
easier for you.

01:18:31.431 --> 01:18:34.935
Kill her now.

01:18:43.744 --> 01:18:47.145
Fucking do it!

01:18:47.147 --> 01:18:51.419
If you don't, we kill you both.

01:18:59.694 --> 01:19:03.196
Oh yeah?

01:19:03.198 --> 01:19:06.432
What about her?

01:19:09.570 --> 01:19:13.773
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Too late.

01:19:13.775 --> 01:19:15.407
Easy.

01:19:15.409 --> 01:19:17.076
You don't want to do this,
Mallory.

01:19:17.078 --> 01:19:20.313
You already did this,
you bitch!

01:19:20.315 --> 01:19:22.413
Put the knife down!

01:19:22.415 --> 01:19:24.086
Shut up!

01:19:26.753 --> 01:19:30.990
- If you do this, we're gonna go after your family.
- Oh.

01:19:30.992 --> 01:19:34.827
Do you want the second one on the
same leg or on your other leg?

01:19:34.829 --> 01:19:37.332
Fuck you!

01:19:39.034 --> 01:19:43.068
Now tell them to put
the guns down!

01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:44.636
Down with the guns.

01:19:44.638 --> 01:19:46.173
Down!

01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:56.215
Kat.

01:19:56.217 --> 01:19:58.617
Get his gun.

01:19:58.619 --> 01:20:03.288
Okay, girls. Whoever
wants to bust out, follow me.

01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:04.490
Let's go!

01:20:04.492 --> 01:20:06.128
Let's go!

01:20:25.712 --> 01:20:28.147
Come on! Come on!

01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:30.782
Call him off!
Call him off!

01:20:30.784 --> 01:20:34.386
If you let me go, I'm
not gonna go after your family.

01:20:34.388 --> 01:20:35.920
Call him off!

01:20:35.922 --> 01:20:39.992
Call him off
right now!

01:20:43.698 --> 01:20:50.469
Tell him to drop the gun! Tell
him to drop the motherfucking gun!

01:20:58.012 --> 01:21:00.112
Back up!

01:21:05.552 --> 01:21:08.987
Get the keys.

01:21:08.989 --> 01:21:10.689
Pull it up.

01:21:10.691 --> 01:21:13.158
What happens here is wrong.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:15.960
You should all know that!
And I want everyone to tell

01:21:15.962 --> 01:21:19.865
everybody what this
crazy bitch made us do.

01:21:19.867 --> 01:21:22.800
Thanks, ginger.

01:21:22.802 --> 01:21:24.571
What was it you said?

01:21:24.573 --> 01:21:26.505
Something about being tough?

01:21:26.507 --> 01:21:29.477
Well, let's see how
tough you are.

01:21:30.811 --> 01:21:34.045
Don't leave me with this animal.

01:21:34.047 --> 01:21:36.648
They're your animals.

01:21:38.852 --> 01:21:41.786
- Fucking finish her!
- No!

01:21:47.028 --> 01:21:49.261
So, where we going?

01:21:49.263 --> 01:21:51.365
I got to get
to the U.S. Embassy.

01:21:54.438 --> 01:21:58.836
