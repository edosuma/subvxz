01:19.161 --> 01:21.496
- God, I just hope nothing
horrible happened to them.

01:21.497 --> 01:22.414
They were so close!

01:22.415 --> 01:24.625
- Ma'am, please, step back.

01:26.002 --> 01:28.963
Sheriff, what do you think happened?

01:30.840 --> 01:35.135

sure doesn't like cats.

08:47.151 --> 08:50.654
- With a friend, with a special friend?

08:50.654 --> 08:52.405
- All by my lonesome.

08:52.406 --> 08:54.699
- Ob, don't ask your mother.

08:56.535 --> 08:59.329
- [Charles] Well, actually,
there's a girl that works there.

08:59.329 --> 09:01.789
I thought I might ask her out.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.042

- She's pretty too.

- I don't know.

I guess I'll find out, won't I?

09:21.685 --> 09:23.269
Jealous?

late, but this allergy

16:07.549 --> 16:08.967
is so severe.

16:08.967 --> 16:10.510

Mine's the I.R.S.

- Anything special in mind?

- Am I beautiful?

16:54.387 --> 16:57.973
- You're always beautiful, Mother.

16:57.974 --> 16:58.766
- So,

16:59.935 --> 17:02.729
did you ask this mystery girl out?

17:04.314 --> 17:08.814
- What kind of a girl would go
out with a guy she just met?

17:09.944 --> 17:12.030
- Not a very nice one, I suppose.

17:12.030 --> 17:13.364
(cat meowing)

17:13.365 --> 17:14.656
- Another one?

17:14.657 --> 17:15.867
- Goddamn cats.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.661
- Don't swear, Mother.

17:21.122 --> 17:24.916
- Just you make sure you
ask her out tomorrow.

17:27.753 --> 17:29.046
What's her name?

17:29.965 --> 17:31.424
- Tanya Robertson.

17:35.387 --> 17:36.513
- Is she nice?

17:37.681 --> 17:38.723
- She's nice.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.978
I'm sure of it.

17:42.978 --> 17:44.229
She’s pure.

17:44.229 --> 17:44.979
- Good.

17:47.774 --> 17:49.567
I'm famished, Charles.

(soft music)

17:59.327 --> 18:00.119

hiding in human robes.

18:14.509 --> 18:16.552
Sc, in the end, they ran.

18:17.637 --> 18:21.182
In the end, Robbie and bis
mother always bad to run.

18:21.182 --> 18:23.726
For one night, the men would
come in their old cars,

18:23.727 --> 18:26.312
men with lights and guns.

18:26.313 --> 18:28.189
And to the boy and his mother,

18:28.189 --> 18:29.690
their curses and their screams of rage

18:29.691 --> 18:32.193
always sound the same.

18:32.193 --> 18:35.529
Like the laughter of cruel gods.

18:35.530 --> 18:38.032
The time of happiness, too brief to be

18:38.033 --> 18:40.744
anything but golden, had run out.

18:42.579 --> 18:45.790
(students applauding)

18:45.790 --> 18:48.000
- Very good, Charles, very good.

18:48.001 --> 18:50.461
Your teachers in Ohio must
have been sorry to lose

18:50.462 --> 18:52.672
such a creative young man.

18:52.672 --> 18:55.466
- I beg your pardon, Mr. Fallows?

18:55.467 --> 18:58.595
- Isn't that where you
transferred from, Ohio?

18:58.595 --> 19:00.430
- Ob, yes, yes, it is.

19:00.430 --> 19:01.222
- Hey.

19:04.059 --> 19:04.851
Ah, shit!

19:15.695 --> 19:17.613
- I suggest that next
time you keep your hands

19:17.614 --> 19:19.824
to yourself, Mr. Crawford.

19:19.824 --> 19:20.699
- Yes, sir.

19:23.328 --> 19:24.162
Asshole.

19:24.162 --> 19:28.624
- All right, any thoughts
on Mr. Brady's Sleepwalkers?

19:31.336 --> 19:32.670
Ms. Robertson?

19:32.671 --> 19:33.713
- I liked it.

19:35.131 --> 19:36.340
- You liked it?

19:37.634 --> 19:39.844
- It was different.

19:39.844 --> 19:42.847
- I thought it was very sad.

19:42.847 --> 19:44.890
- [ Mr. Fallows] Sad, why?

19:46.601 --> 19:49.687
- Because they were always driven away.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.065
Because they were such outsiders.

19:52.065 --> 19:55.234
- I think Ms. Robertson
might be on to something.

19:55.235 --> 19:59.072
Now, we all understand that a
story has to have a beginning,

19:59.072 --> 20:01.282
a middle and an end, right?

20:03.576 --> 20:06.996
But that's like saying
a box has four sides.

20:06.996 --> 20:10.040
- Actually, Mr. Fallows,
a box has six sides.

20:10.041 --> 20:11.208
(students laughing)

20:11.209 --> 20:12.752

20:52.751 --> 20:54.210
- Yeah, he's nice.

20:54.210 --> 20:55.169
- Real nice.

20:56.546 --> 20:57.547
- I'm serious!

20:57.547 --> 20:59.215
- I can see that.

20:59.215 --> 21:02.218
- Well, what happened, did
be ask you out or anything?

21:02.218 --> 21:05.679
- Nothing specific, just a maybe.

21:05.680 --> 21:06.806
We just talked at the theater.

21:06.806 --> 21:09.391
- That's all you would've done anyway.

21:09.392 --> 21:10.893
- What a waste!

21:10.894 --> 21:13.354
- Well, excuse me, but
what would you have done?

21:13.354 --> 21:14.396
- Everything.

21:15.982 --> 21:17.024
- Everything !

21:18.777 --> 21:21.821
Well, I may have plans of my own,

21:21.821 --> 21:23.948
and they just might include Homeland.

21:23.948 --> 21:24.865
- Ooh!

21:24.866 --> 21:26.284
- Yeah, right, I can just see you

21:26.284 --> 21:28.577
in the back seat at Homeland.

21:28.578 --> 21:30.454
- [Tanya] You guys!

21:30.455 --> 21:32.415
- Tanya, you gotta admit,
your dad's gonna be there.

21:32.415 --> 21:33.749
I can just see it.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.127
- My dad's not gonna be there!

21:36.127 --> 21:36.919
- Hi.

21:38.379 --> 21:39.505
- Charles, hi.

21:42.050 --> 21:45.053
Charles, do you know Jeanette and Carrie?

21:45.053 --> 21:46.554
This is Charles Brady.

21:46.554 --> 21:47.388
- Hi.

21:47.388 --> 21:49.515
- We are in the same class, Tanya.

21:49.516 --> 21:50.725
- Ob.

21:50.725 --> 21:52.560
- Can I give you a ride home?

21:52.560 --> 21:54.311
I mean, all of you?

21:54.312 --> 21:56.522
- No, we've got a ride.

21:56.523 --> 21:58.816
But why don't you go, Tanya?

22:00.652 --> 22:02.278
- OK, see you later.

22:09.202 --> 22:09.994
- I,

22:10.912 --> 22:13.873
I also wanted to thank you.

22:13.873 --> 22:15.958
- [Tanya ] For what?

22:15.959 --> 22:18.461
- For what you said in class.

22:18.461 --> 22:20.838
I mean, you really nailed it.

22:22.715 --> 22:25.634
- [Tanya] No, you did, so thank you.

22:25.635 --> 22:27.386
I think I know bow they feel, the,

22:27.387 --> 22:28.221
what are they called?

22:28.221 --> 22:29.222
- Sleepwalkers.

22:29.222 --> 22:30.389
- Sleepwalkers.

22:31.724 --> 22:35.102
At least sometimes I feel that different.

22:44.612 --> 22:45.738
- Madam.

22:45.738 --> 22:46.864
- This yours?

22:46.865 --> 22:48.283
- Do you like it?

22:48.283 --> 22:49.075
- Yeah.

22:54.581 --> 22:57.166
(students chattering)

22:57.166 --> 22:58.750
Whoa!

22:58.751 --> 23:00.544
You know, some people use a door.

23:00.545 --> 23:01.379
- [Charles] Really?

23:01.379 --> 23:02.213
- Yes.

23:02.213 --> 23:03.047
- [Charles] I heard that somewhere.

23:03.047 --> 23:03.881
- Did you?

23:03.882 --> 23:05.174
- [Charles] Mm-hm.

23:05.174 --> 23:07.885
(engine revving)

23:14.017 --> 23:14.809
- Mom?

23:15.852 --> 23:16.644
Mom?

23:18.187 --> 23:20.606
She must be shopping or something.

23:20.607 --> 23:21.983
Let's go upstairs.

23:21.983 --> 23:22.775
- OK.

23:27.989 --> 23:29.448
- Thanks for the ride home.

23:29.449 --> 23:30.241
- Anytime.

23:32.327 --> 23:34.495
Ob, wow, these are interesting.

23:34.495 --> 23:35.287
- Ob.

23:36.539 --> 23:38.958
My mom does gravestone rubbings.

23:38.958 --> 23:40.501
Pretty morbid, huh?

23:41.419 --> 23:42.795
- No, I like 'em.

23:42.795 --> 23:43.629
- You do?

23:43.630 --> 23:44.964
- Yeah.

23:44.964 --> 23:46.006
- Ew.

23:46.007 --> 23:48.801
(Tanya chuckling)

23:50.678 --> 23:51.470
My room.

23:52.972 --> 23:55.182
- Oh, you have a lot of pictures.

23:55.183 --> 23:57.518
- Yeah, it's kind of a bobby.

23:59.395 --> 24:01.188
- Ob, these are great!

24:03.942 --> 24:04.901
Really nice.

24:06.027 --> 24:08.195
Makes you want to...

24:08.196 --> 24:09.447
- What?

24:09.447 --> 24:12.992
- Ob, just really get a good
look at these kind of places.

24:12.992 --> 24:17.246
You know, things that we never really see.

24:17.246 --> 24:20.958
- My favorite picture's over there.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.377
- [Charles] Which one?

24:22.377 --> 24:23.169
- Uh...

24:25.505 --> 24:26.339
(exhaling deeply)

24:26.339 --> 24:27.131
Uh...

24:28.091 --> 24:28.883
That one.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.511
- I like rocks.

24:32.512 --> 24:33.304
- You do?

24:36.099 --> 24:38.684
- You know, I'd really like to
see how you see a photograph

24:38.685 --> 24:40.478
before you take it.

24:40.478 --> 24:42.646
I mean, you don't even know me, but...

24:42.647 --> 24:46.442
- Well, actually, I was gonna
shoot at Homeland tomorrow

24:46.442 --> 24:49.528
if, well, if you want to come.

24:49.529 --> 24:50.863
- What's Homeland?

24:50.863 --> 24:53.824
- Ob, it's an old graveyard.

24:53.825 --> 24:54.659
- Really?

24:54.659 --> 24:55.576
- Yeah, it's neat.

24:55.576 --> 24:57.286
- I love old graveyards.

24:57.286 --> 24:58.120
- Sweetheart!

24:58.121 --> 24:58.955
- [Tanya] Mom !

24:58.955 --> 24:59.956
- Ob, ob, I'm sorry, dear,

24:59.956 --> 25:02.124
I didn't know you bad company.

25:02.125 --> 25:04.335
- Oh, this is Charles Brady.

25:04.335 --> 25:05.836
This is my mom.

25:05.837 --> 25:07.046
- Charles.

25:07.046 --> 25:08.881
- He gave me a ride home.

25:08.881 --> 25:10.340
- Ob, that's nice.

25:11.551 --> 25:12.969
Charles.

25:12.969 --> 25:14.887
- Very nice to meet you.

25:14.887 --> 25:15.762
- Likewise.

25:17.640 --> 25:18.974
- Well, we should go.

25:18.975 --> 25:20.559
We were just going.

25:20.560 --> 25:21.769
So we'll do that tomorrow?

25:21.769 --> 25:22.603
- [Charles] Yes.

25:22.603 --> 25:23.395
- OK.

25:25.398 --> 25:26.649
I'll walk you out.

25:26.649 --> 25:27.441
- OK.

25:29.652 --> 25:32.946
- So you two are going out tomorrow?

25:32.947 --> 25:34.448
- Yes.

25:34.449 --> 25:36.325
- Tanya's gonna show me

25:38.119 --> 25:38.911
Homeland.

25:39.787 --> 25:41.497
- Ob, really?

25:41.497 --> 25:43.624
- You see, I do rubbings too.

25:43.624 --> 25:45.500
Not quite as fine as yours,
but I figure there must be

25:45.501 --> 25:48.795
some old slate gravestones out there.

25:48.796 --> 25:51.590
- Yes, as a matter of fact,

25:51.591 --> 25:53.968
in the old section near the woods.

25:53.968 --> 25:56.553
Tell me, Charles, do
you use powder or stick?

25:56.554 --> 25:59.765
- I use stick, usually a number five.

25:59.766 --> 26:02.435
- Really, don't you
find that a little bard?

26:02.435 --> 26:05.438
- Yeah, but, I'm clumsy, you know,

26:05.438 --> 26:07.273
powder's so messy and everything.

26:07.273 --> 26:09.233
(Mrs. Robertson chuckling)

26:09.233 --> 26:11.026
- Tell me, Charles, where do you live?

26:11.027 --> 26:13.070
- 66 Wicker Street.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.031
- And your father, what does be do?

26:15.031 --> 26:17.700
- He's dead, Mrs. Robertson.

26:17.700 --> 26:18.784
- Ob, I'm sorry.

26:18.785 --> 26:21.662
- [Charles] It was a long time ago.

26:22.955 --> 26:23.747
- Well,

26:24.832 --> 26:26.917
the Brands will be coming
to dinner tomorrow night.

26:26.918 --> 26:28.920
Sc be back by 5:00, OK?

26:28.920 --> 26:29.921
- OK.

26:29.921 --> 26:31.047
- She will be.

26:38.221 --> 26:39.805
- How'd you know all that stuff?

26:39.806 --> 26:43.392
- I learned it a long
time ago, from my mom.

26:45.728 --> 26:47.146
See you tomorrow.

26:47.146 --> 26:47.938
- OK.

26:51.359 --> 26:53.736

- Mr. Fallows, bi.

27:48.291 --> 27:49.667
- Hello, Charles.

27:50.668 --> 27:53.796
Checking out your new environment?

27:53.796 --> 27:55.547
Boring, isn't it?

27:55.548 --> 27:58.926
Disneyland for cows but for human beings?

28:00.678 --> 28:04.390
- Well, I like it, it's kind of peaceful.

28:04.390 --> 28:07.851
- [Mr. Fallows] Reminds
you of Ohio, I suppose?

28:07.852 --> 28:10.104
- Yeah, well, you know.

28:10.104 --> 28:13.607
- No, actually, I don't,
Charles, I don't know.

28:13.608 --> 28:15.359
And you don't, either.

28:15.359 --> 28:18.820
There is no Paradise Falls in Ohio.

28:18.821 --> 28:21.824
Your transcripts are also fakes.

28:21.824 --> 28:23.784
Clever fakes, but fakes.

28:25.036 --> 28:26.579
Anything to say?

28:26.579 --> 28:27.746
- You're mistaken.

28:27.747 --> 28:30.791
- Oh, no, I'm not, but you
are, Charles, if you think

28:30.791 --> 28:32.751
you can wiggle out of this.

28:32.752 --> 28:35.171
I don't know who you are,
but I know you're not

28:35.171 --> 28:36.797
who you say you are.

28:37.924 --> 28:39.550
- If this is blackmail, Mr. Fallows,

28:39.550 --> 28:41.718
I think you've picked the wrong guy.

28:41.719 --> 28:43.470
This car is the only
expensive thing I've got.

28:43.471 --> 28:45.181
And I'm kind of sentimental about it.

28:45.181 --> 28:46.932
I don't think I can sell it.

28:46.933 --> 28:47.808
Ow!

28:47.808 --> 28:51.478
- Sit still till I'm through with you.

28:51.479 --> 28:54.440
Your generation is so mercenary, Charles.

28:54.440 --> 28:56.692
Money this, money that.

28:56.692 --> 29:01.192
Well, money is not the
only medium of exchange.

29:01.197 --> 29:01.989
Ab !

29:03.741 --> 29:05.659
- You're right, Mr. Fellows,
people really should learn

29:05.660 --> 29:07.912
to keep their hands to themselves.

29:07.912 --> 29:08.954
Here's yours.

29:14.502 --> 29:16.170
(Charles growling)

29:16.170 --> 29:19.381
(dramatic theme music)

29:23.135 --> 29:26.346
(Mr. Fellows shouting)

29:31.227 --> 29:32.186
- I'm sorry!

29:33.479 --> 29:36.690
(dramatic theme music)

29:59.213 --> 30:02.090
(Charles growling)

30:19.066 --> 30:21.610
(cats meowing)

30:24.447 --> 30:27.241
(birds chirping)

30:33.414 --> 30:36.750
- Come on, boy, get the bad guy for Daddy.

30:36.751 --> 30:38.753
You know you want him, get this bad guy.

30:38.753 --> 30:41.714
Come on, there you go,
there you go, Clovis.

30:41.714 --> 30:43.507
Come on, boy!

30:43.507 --> 30:45.842
Come on, boy, get the bad guy.

30:45.843 --> 30:50.097
Get the bad guy, get the
bad guy, come on, Clovis!

30:50.097 --> 30:52.933
Here we go, get that motherfucker!

30:52.933 --> 30:54.976
Ha, ha, ha, all right!

30:54.977 --> 30:57.187
Good boy, Clovis!

30:57.188 --> 31:00.232
Yeah, that's a good boy, huh, Clovis?

31:04.278 --> 31:06.113
Well, Clovis.

31:06.113 --> 31:10.242
Looks like we found ourselves
a goddamn speedster.

31:16.707 --> 31:19.584
(rock theme music)

31:21.170 --> 31:23.130
(Charles chuckling)

31:23.130 --> 31:25.549
Unit Three calling home,
you in there, Laurie?

31:25.549 --> 31:26.383
Come on.

31:26.384 --> 31:28.344
- [Laurie] Andy, what you up to, bye.

31:28.344 --> 31:30.846
- Got ourselves one lawless
perpetrator heading east

31:30.846 --> 31:33.098
Out here on Gray Road, copy.

31:33.099 --> 31:35.768
- [Laurie] Copy, need any help, bye.

31:35.768 --> 31:39.897
- No, I think I can handle
this one all by myself.

31:41.023 --> 31:42.899
What the, Jesus!

31:42.900 --> 31:45.777
(rock theme music)

31:50.658 --> 31:53.869
(cat meowing)

31:53.869 --> 31:56.746
(rock theme music)

32:27.278 --> 32:28.112
(cat meowing)

32:28.112 --> 32:28.904
Ob, shit!

32:32.867 --> 32:35.744
(rock theme music)

32:52.219 --> 32:55.180
(children shouting)

33:02.730 --> 33:03.522
Jesus, no!

33:08.486 --> 33:09.320
- Everybody OK?

33:09.320 --> 33:11.864
- [Crossing Guarding] Go get him!

33:11.864 --> 33:13.824
- Son of a bitch.

33:13.824 --> 33:15.826
- [Laurie] Report, Unit
Three, need a location.

33:15.826 --> 33:18.662
- I'm out on Pond Road,
Laurie, still in pursuit.

33:18.662 --> 33:20.538
Bastard almost ran down a little girl !

33:20.539 --> 33:22.499
I think be tried to run her down.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.043
And I think he's playing with me!

33:24.043 --> 33:25.836
Get me some backup, bye.

33:25.836 --> 33:28.672
(rock theme music)

33:39.391 --> 33:40.183
Pull over!

33:41.352 --> 33:43.312
Pull over, motherfucker!

33:45.814 --> 33:47.440
Pull over!

33:47.441 --> 33:50.277
(cat meowing)

33:50.277 --> 33:52.737
(cat meowing)

33:56.075 --> 33:57.201
What the fuck?

33:58.285 --> 34:01.162
(rock theme music)

34:04.458 --> 34:06.042
- [Laurie] What's going
on out there, Andy?

34:06.043 --> 34:07.210
Please respond!

34:07.211 --> 34:08.670
- Not now, Laurie.

34:14.885 --> 34:19.385
Christ, Clovis, what's he
got in there, a supercharger?

34:20.014 --> 34:22.891
(rock theme music)

34:34.780 --> 34:37.908
(soft dramatic theme)

34:58.053 --> 35:00.764
(siren wailing)

35:24.413 --> 35:25.288
I lost him.

35:27.458 --> 35:29.918
How in the hell did I do that?

35:33.047 --> 35:34.757
- Stop looking at me.

35:38.510 --> 35:40.053
Stop looking at me.

35:41.138 --> 35:44.391
Stop looking at me, you fucking cat!

35:44.391 --> 35:46.851
(cat meowing)

36:02.576 --> 36:03.785
- Shit, Clovis.

36:07.456 --> 36:09.499
I know just how you feel.

36:24.264 --> 36:27.058
(engine starting)

36:45.285 --> 36:47.662
Can I tell you something, Ira?

36:47.663 --> 36:49.790
It's kind of weird, but...

36:51.375 --> 36:55.253
Horace, if you laugh,
I'm gonna break your jaw.

36:58.298 --> 36:59.340
- What is it?

37:00.592 --> 37:02.218
- Well, you know bow I
told you I couldn't see him

37:02.219 --> 37:04.179
because of how fast we were going, right?

37:04.179 --> 37:05.680
- [Ira] Yeah.

37:05.681 --> 37:07.849
- Well, that wasn't entirely true.

37:07.850 --> 37:09.434
- How's that?

37:09.435 --> 37:11.895
- Well, we were both doing 90,
I pulled right up beside him.

37:11.895 --> 37:13.980
We might as well have been standing still!

37:13.981 --> 37:16.066
- So you did get a look at him.

37:16.066 --> 37:19.110
- Well, no, no, I didn't, cause, see,

37:23.115 --> 37:24.991
he didn't have no face.

37:26.660 --> 37:30.747
- Andy, you got plenty
of sick time coming.

37:30.748 --> 37:33.125
- Horace, shut your pie hole.

37:35.419 --> 37:38.547
- I mean his face, it was like a blur!

37:39.673 --> 37:40.465
Like...

37:41.884 --> 37:43.427
Shit, I don't know.

37:47.639 --> 37:50.266
- Maybe you got some grit in your eye.

37:50.267 --> 37:51.643
Makes them water.

37:55.022 --> 37:57.733
- Yeah, I guess maybe
that could've been it.

37:57.733 --> 38:00.110
- Andy, do me a favor.

38:00.110 --> 38:03.029
When you do get this stampeder,

38:03.030 --> 38:04.990
just leave that part out when you talk

38:04.990 --> 38:07.367
To the county proseoutor, OK?

38:10.913 --> 38:13.373
Anything else, Andy?

38:13.373 --> 38:15.166
Anything at all?

38:15.167 --> 38:17.460
- Yeah, there was something.

38:19.880 --> 38:23.675
Clovis here got a good look at
him, and he didn't like him.

38:23.675 --> 38:27.345
He didn't like him one little bit.

38:27.346 --> 38:30.140
And it was the other guy
too, be didn't like Clovis!

38:30.140 --> 38:32.350
It was like he was scared of him.

38:32.351 --> 38:33.643
Scared cf a cat!

38:37.606 --> 38:38.398
- Hmm.

38:39.858 --> 38:43.611
- I'm gonna look for
this guy on my way home.

38:43.612 --> 38:45.488
And I'm gonna find him.

38:47.282 --> 38:48.825
I'm gonna find him !

39:00.462 --> 39:03.256
(car approaching)

39:20.858 --> 39:22.234
- You didn't get it?

39:22.234 --> 39:23.026
- No.

39:24.027 --> 39:25.486
- Why didn't you get anything?

39:25.487 --> 39:27.822
- [Charles] I just couldn't.

39:27.823 --> 39:29.366
- What about the girl?

39:29.366 --> 39:31.409
- It wasn't the right time.

39:31.410 --> 39:33.954
Tomorrow, I'll get it tomorrow.

39:35.998 --> 39:38.333
- What are you talking about?

39:38.333 --> 39:40.293
I'm starving, Charles!

39:40.294 --> 39:43.672
I need it, and you have to get it for me!

39:46.049 --> 39:48.301
(loud smacking)

39:48.302 --> 39:49.094
One!

39:54.975 --> 39:56.351
Ob, my poor baby!

39:57.477 --> 39:58.478
What happened?

39:58.478 --> 40:00.438
- What always happens, Mom?

40:00.439 --> 40:01.898
- Someone saw you?

40:03.150 --> 40:06.778
- The deputy had a cat,
maybe for a second or two.

40:06.778 --> 40:08.488
- [ Mary] He won't believe what be saw.

40:08.488 --> 40:10.448
- No, be probably won't.

40:11.742 --> 40:16.242
Somebody will find the teacher
that I dumped in the woods.

40:16.246 --> 40:18.373
It's already started again, Mom!

40:18.373 --> 40:21.167
- [ Mary] Don't worry, don't worry.

40:21.168 --> 40:22.836
- But I have to feed you.

40:22.836 --> 40:24.128
- You'll see her tomorrow.

40:24.129 --> 40:26.339
- [Charles] What if
something happens to me?

40:26.340 --> 40:27.466
You’ll starve!

40:29.384 --> 40:32.136
We haven't even seen another sleepwalker.

40:32.137 --> 40:33.596
- Ob, we aren't the last.

40:33.597 --> 40:34.431
- [Charles] You don't know that.

40:34.431 --> 40:35.390
- Yes, I do!

40:37.809 --> 40:39.602
I can feel the others.

40:41.813 --> 40:43.981
You'll feed tomorrow,
and then you'll feed me,

40:43.982 --> 40:46.442
and then we will leave.

40:46.443 --> 40:48.319
Nothing’s gonna happen.

40:54.868 --> 40:58.162
We just have to take care of each other.

40:59.539 --> 41:01.999
(cat meowing)

41:03.961 --> 41:06.505
(cats meowing)

41:08.090 --> 41:10.550
(cat meowing)

41:14.596 --> 41:18.808
(trap snapping with cat shrieking)

41:19.851 --> 41:22.311
(eerie music)

41:39.496 --> 41:42.624
(cats meowing softly)

41:46.586 --> 41:50.715
("Sleepwalk" by Johnny and Santo)

42:40.015 --> 42:40.765
- OK.

42:43.560 --> 42:45.436
- Remember, honey, I
want you home by 5:00.

42:45.437 --> 42:48.940
Make sure Charles understands that, OK?

42:48.940 --> 42:52.318
- Yes, Mommy, I'll be sure
to pack extra didies too.

42:52.319 --> 42:54.738
- Nobody loves a smart-ass, Tanya.

42:54.738 --> 42:56.197
- She is smart, dear.

42:56.198 --> 42:58.200
And I'm smart enough to
know this is her first date

42:58.200 --> 43:00.869
with the new boy in town.

43:00.869 --> 43:03.246
We do understand each
other, don't we, Tan?

43:03.246 --> 43:06.207
- You know, Mom, I think we do.

43:06.208 --> 43:07.250
- Good, 5:00?

43:08.418 --> 43:09.210
- 5:00.

43:11.880 --> 43:12.714
- Bye, darlin'.

43:12.714 --> 43:13.715
- Bye, Dad.

43:13.715 --> 43:14.841
- Have a good time, boney.

43:14.841 --> 43:16.592
- [Tanya] I hope so!

43:16.593 --> 43:18.303
- Are we awful?

43:18.303 --> 43:22.140
- Terrible, God, I've become my mother.

43:22.140 --> 43:24.267
- Well, you met this kid, Is be OK?

43:24.267 --> 43:27.979
- Yeah, he’s terrific,
he’s utterly charming.

43:32.275 --> 43:33.901
- [Charles] Does it have to be her?

43:33.902 --> 43:36.279
- You care more for her than for me?

43:36.279 --> 43:38.572
- You know better than that.

43:40.325 --> 43:42.869
Why are you being such a bitch?

43:44.579 --> 43:46.289
- Because I'm hungry!

43:53.922 --> 43:57.675
You cannot be in love
with this girl, Charles.

43:59.761 --> 44:00.595
Charles?

44:00.595 --> 44:03.389
(doorbell chiming)

44:03.390 --> 44:05.767
- I'll get it, you stay here.

44:10.647 --> 44:11.939
I love you, Mom.

44:13.692 --> 44:14.484
- Do you?

44:16.153 --> 44:19.030
(doorbell chiming)

44:24.202 --> 44:24.994
- Hi.

44:26.329 --> 44:29.081
I know you were supposed to
pick me up, but I was nearby.

44:29.082 --> 44:30.374
- Yeah, Tanya...

44:31.918 --> 44:34.587
- Ob, ob, this is a bad time.

44:34.588 --> 44:37.549
- Nonsense, I'm so glad you came by.

44:39.968 --> 44:42.178
- [Tanya] Thank you.

44:42.179 --> 44:43.513
- Well, we really ought to go.

44:43.513 --> 44:45.014
The light for Tanya's pictures--

44:45.015 --> 44:48.101
- Will be just fine for hours yet.

44:48.101 --> 44:50.770
Come in, Tanya, I have something for you.

44:50.770 --> 44:51.812
- You do?

44:51.813 --> 44:53.314
- Mm-hmm.

44:53.315 --> 44:55.108
I won't keep you long.

44:55.108 --> 44:58.486
I know young people have to run and play.

45:02.866 --> 45:04.242
- Wow!

45:04.242 --> 45:07.453
- Charles said you were
nice, and he was right.

45:07.454 --> 45:08.830
He usually is.

45:08.830 --> 45:12.667
- Oh, well, thank you,
Charles is very nice himself.

45:12.667 --> 45:16.212
You have a very beautiful
home, Mrs. Brady.

45:17.839 --> 45:20.508
Wow, these are beautiful figurines.

45:20.508 --> 45:23.010
- [Mary] Oh, they've been in
the family for a long time.

45:23.011 --> 45:25.805
You probably wouldn't believe how long.

45:25.805 --> 45:29.225
- Mom, we really ought to be going.

45:29.226 --> 45:30.518
- Soon, Charles.

45:31.478 --> 45:33.104
Soon.

45:33.104 --> 45:34.730
Just a second, dear.

45:40.111 --> 45:41.737
- This is beautiful.

45:45.909 --> 45:47.869
Mmm, nice car.

45:47.869 --> 45:49.036
Where's the Trans Am?

45:49.037 --> 45:51.289
- Oh, it's in the shop.

45:51.289 --> 45:52.790
The Mustang belongs to--

45:52.791 --> 45:53.833
- His mother.

45:57.337 --> 45:58.921
- Wow.

45:58.922 --> 46:01.215
Those all your cats,
there's a lot of them.

46:01.216 --> 46:03.635
- Oh, they're strays, but
we'll get rid of them.

46:03.635 --> 46:04.469
(Tanya gasping)

46:04.469 --> 46:07.346
We're good at getting rid of pests.

46:14.688 --> 46:15.480
There.

46:16.690 --> 46:18.650
It finishes you somehow.

46:19.526 --> 46:21.528
- Thank you, that's very sweet.

46:21.528 --> 46:25.156
- Ob, sweets to the sweet, I always say.

46:25.156 --> 46:26.365
Right, Charles?

46:28.785 --> 46:32.163
Go on now, you two, you'll lose the light.

46:32.163 --> 46:33.789
- Um,

46:33.790 --> 46:36.793
Mrs. Brady, it was
really nice to meet you.

46:36.793 --> 46:39.086
- Ob, very nice to meet you.

46:39.963 --> 46:43.508
(door opening and closing)

46:50.849 --> 46:53.643
(birds chirping)

47:00.650 --> 47:01.484
- This way.

47:01.484 --> 47:03.027
- Thank you, ma'am.

47:04.029 --> 47:06.489
(soft music)

47:14.456 --> 47:15.498
- This is it.

47:18.209 --> 47:20.669
(soft music)

47:37.354 --> 47:39.731
- It's really beautiful here.

47:41.483 --> 47:43.276
And so are you, Tanya.

47:44.402 --> 47:46.112
- Thank you, Charles.

47:49.491 --> 47:52.494
- Well, I better get these
out of the way right off.

47:52.494 --> 47:53.953
Your mother’s gonna want
to know some rubbing

47:53.953 --> 47:55.329
went on out here.

47:57.791 --> 47:59.209
- Me too, Charles.

48:02.837 --> 48:04.839
(soft music)

48:04.839 --> 48:05.881
Hey, wait up!

48:09.177 --> 48:11.637
(soft music)

48:15.350 --> 48:16.142
Charles?

48:18.436 --> 48:20.980
(eerie music)

48:22.565 --> 48:23.357
Charles?

48:27.695 --> 48:28.487
Ob!

48:29.989 --> 48:30.948
Oh, hold it.

48:34.411 --> 48:36.037
- [Charles] Come on.

48:55.974 --> 48:58.017
(Andy chuckling)

48:58.017 --> 48:59.852
- Hey, Clovis, hey Clovis, what's up?

48:59.853 --> 49:01.396
You catching a nap?

49:04.107 --> 49:05.733
♪ There comes Johnny with
his pecker in his band ♪

49:05.733 --> 49:08.402
♪ He's a one-balled man

(cat meowing)

49:12.115 --> 49:14.909
(birds chirping)

49:26.337 --> 49:28.464
- What are you looking at?

49:29.507 --> 49:30.341
Hm?

49:30.341 --> 49:31.759
(snapping photos)

49:31.759 --> 49:33.886
Ah, oh, very nice, gotcha.

49:35.305 --> 49:36.806
(Charles chuckling)

49:36.806 --> 49:39.099
Ob, very nice, smile pretty.

49:40.226 --> 49:41.352
Ob, very nice!

49:43.146 --> 49:44.438
- Ob, I'm sorry.

49:46.900 --> 49:50.612
(Charles and Tanya giggling)

50:10.173 --> 50:10.965
Sorry.

50:17.764 --> 50:18.723
- No sorrys.

50:21.768 --> 50:24.228
(soft music)

50:36.074 --> 50:36.866
Charles.

50:38.660 --> 50:42.789
Do you really feel alone, like
the characters in your story?

50:42.789 --> 50:43.748
'Cause I do.

50:46.376 --> 50:47.168
- I know.

50:52.465 --> 50:54.675
- It's wonderful to feel...

50:56.386 --> 50:59.055
To feel like you're really with someone.

50:59.055 --> 51:00.264
Together.

51:00.265 --> 51:01.140
- Look, I think we better--

51:01.140 --> 51:01.932
- Charles,

51:03.518 --> 51:04.310
Ssh.

51:07.730 --> 51:10.190
- You don't know me, Tanya.

51:10.191 --> 51:11.483
- But I want to.

51:27.041 --> 51:27.833
Ow!

51:30.587 --> 51:31.879
A little slower.

51:34.257 --> 51:38.219
- But I thought we
understood each other, Tanya.

51:52.567 --> 51:55.278
(Tanya groaning)

51:59.365 --> 52:01.450
(Tanya shouting)

52:01.451 --> 52:02.452
- I couldn't breathe.

52:02.452 --> 52:05.496
- Isn't this the excitement
you were talking about, Tanya?

52:05.496 --> 52:08.290
(Tanya screaming)

52:13.129 --> 52:17.174
You're right, we do
understand each other, Tanya.

52:20.345 --> 52:23.723
See, this is just bow we live, Tanya.

52:23.723 --> 52:26.517
(Tanya screaming)

52:27.894 --> 52:29.395
Tanya!

52:29.395 --> 52:30.229
(Tanya screaming)

52:30.229 --> 52:32.189
It doesn't have to hurt!

52:33.107 --> 52:35.067
Don't you get it, Tanya?

52:35.068 --> 52:35.943
I need you.

52:36.986 --> 52:38.779
I need you to live!

52:38.780 --> 52:41.407
- Oh, God, please don't kill me!

52:46.412 --> 52:48.539
(loud smacking)

52:48.539 --> 52:50.749
- Tanya, I don't think you're entering

52:50.750 --> 52:52.960
into the spirit of this.

52:52.960 --> 52:56.755
Why don't you just think
of yourself as lunch?

53:15.149 --> 53:17.693
(eerie music)

53:24.075 --> 53:25.534
- [Tanya] Charles?

53:29.288 --> 53:30.664
- Peek-a-baby!

53:30.665 --> 53:33.709
(Tanya screaming)

53:33.710 --> 53:34.502
I lied !

53:35.628 --> 53:37.338
It does have to hurt!

53:39.340 --> 53:42.426
Feed me, Tanya, Mother's hungry!

My mother's gonna kill me!

54:00.319 --> 54:02.112
- Get off me, get off!

54:04.157 --> 54:06.159
Stay away from me!

54:06.159 --> 54:10.204
- Now, Tanya, when exactly
did I lose your trust?

54:13.791 --> 54:15.959
- [Tanya] Help me!

54:48.409 --> 54:49.243
He's trying to kill me!

54:49.243 --> 54:50.285

54:50.286 --> 54:51.704
- He's right behind me,
please, he's right behind me!

54:51.704 --> 54:53.038
- We'll get him, we'll get him.

54:53.039 --> 54:54.373

54:56.542 --> 54:59.378

- Look, just calm down.

55:04.884 --> 55:07.136

55:20.900 --> 55:24.486
(Tanya screaming)

55:24.487 --> 55:25.529
Isn't this fun?

55:25.530 --> 55:26.322

(Tanya screaming)

55:35.623 --> 55:38.417
(Tanya screaming)

55:40.753 --> 55:43.213
(gun firing)

55:49.136 --> 55:53.265
I don't believe you fired
a warning shot, Officer.

55:58.145 --> 56:01.064
(gun firing with Andy screaming)

56:01.065 --> 56:02.107
- Ob, my God.

56:03.651 --> 56:07.321
(Tanya screaming)

56:07.321 --> 56:08.113

(cats meowing)

57:49.423 --> 57:51.967
(eerie music)

58:13.072 --> 58:13.864
- Charles.

58:17.576 --> 58:19.202
- My face is so bot.

58:35.344 --> 58:37.137
I'm sorry, Mom, I tried.

58:37.138 --> 58:39.515
I really, really tried.

58:39.515 --> 58:42.059
It was the cat, you were right.

58:43.811 --> 58:44.853
We've only get each other.

58:44.854 --> 58:45.646
- Ssh.

58:46.897 --> 58:48.523
That doesn't matter.

58:50.443 --> 58:51.986
Save your strength.

59:01.245 --> 59:02.663
- [Charles] How bad is it?

59:02.663 --> 59:04.831
- You'll be OK, boney.

59:04.832 --> 59:08.335
But I'm afraid they’ll
be coming for so soon.

59:08.335 --> 59:10.503
(trap snapping with cat shrieking)

59:10.504 --> 59:11.838
- We can go, Mom, I'll be OK.

59:11.839 --> 59:12.631
- No.

59:14.300 --> 59:18.512
We've got to stay here
until you're stronger.

59:18.512 --> 59:22.807
Bot I want you to help me,
try to make yourself dim.

59:23.976 --> 59:26.520
Will you do that for me, boney?

59:29.106 --> 59:29.981
Go on, try.

59:48.834 --> 59:51.795
- I can't, Mom, I can't do it.

59:51.796 --> 59:54.465
- It's all right, I'll
do it for both of us.

59:54.465 --> 59:56.216
- There’s the car and the traps.

59:56.217 --> 59:57.009
- Ssh.

59:59.303 --> 01:00:01.096
I'll take care of you.

01:00:06.143 --> 01:00:07.769
- Hey, buddy, buddy.

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:09.939
I ain't taking the rap on this.

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:11.315
I lock this place up every night.

01:00:11.315 --> 01:00:13.859
It's not my fault if every
pervert, weirdo, horny kid--

01:00:13.859 --> 01:00:16.361
- Don't talk to me, talk
to someone in charge.

01:00:16.362 --> 01:00:17.154
I'm busy.

01:00:19.824 --> 01:00:22.952
(officers chattering)

01:00:25.579 --> 01:00:26.788
- Buddy.

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:27.623
- Yeah?

01:00:27.623 --> 01:00:28.415
- Listen.

01:00:28.415 --> 01:00:31.126
- It's not my fault if
every horny kid and weirdo,

01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:33.295
pervert comes in here,
I lock this place up.

01:00:33.295 --> 01:00:34.337
I don't need this action.

01:00:34.338 --> 01:00:37.966
- OK, don't talk to me,
talk to the sheriff.

01:00:44.181 --> 01:00:46.016
- I've checked six or seven times.

01:00:46.016 --> 01:00:47.809
- Sheriff, bey.

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:48.602
- Not now.

01:00:54.733 --> 01:00:57.986
OK, his name is Charles Brady,
formerly of Paradise Falls,

01:00:57.987 --> 01:01:00.364
now living at Wicker Street.

01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:05.952
And the rest of it, including
the make and color of the car.

01:01:05.953 --> 01:01:08.163
- OK, we came in a red car.

01:01:09.707 --> 01:01:11.834
And it was older.

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:14.002
Bot it wasn't the Trans Am.

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:18.007
See, be took me home in a Trans
Am, it was a blue Trans Am.

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:19.967
And he left here in one.

01:01:21.594 --> 01:01:22.845
- OK.

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:25.889
- Listen to me, I know I sound crazy!

01:01:27.516 --> 01:01:31.645
You're not getting the
point, Charles isn't human.

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:34.148
- Excuse me, Miss.

01:01:34.148 --> 01:01:37.151
Sheriff, I need to document these bruises.

01:01:37.151 --> 01:01:39.444
- [Sheriff] All right.

01:01:39.445 --> 01:01:40.612
- Do you have to do this now?

01:01:40.613 --> 01:01:42.823
- Yeah, it'll just take
a second, don't worry.

01:01:42.823 --> 01:01:45.951
Gould you just turn your bead, please?

01:01:47.995 --> 01:01:50.789
Thanks, and the other way, please?

01:01:53.042 --> 01:01:55.669
- Ob, my God, my camera,
did somebody find my camera?

01:01:55.669 --> 01:01:58.296
I took his picture in my camera.

01:01:59.757 --> 01:02:03.427
Yes, develop that film,
you'll have his picture.

01:02:03.427 --> 01:02:05.095
- Get on it ASAP.

01:02:05.095 --> 01:02:06.137
- Yeah, sure.

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:11.393
This is Officer Rayburn.

01:02:11.393 --> 01:02:13.812
He's gonna run you home.

01:02:13.812 --> 01:02:15.522
I'll have to come over
later tonight and ask you

01:02:15.522 --> 01:02:17.815
a few more questions, all right?

01:02:17.816 --> 01:02:18.942
- OK.

01:02:18.943 --> 01:02:21.820
- Are you sure bis name is Charles Brady?

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:23.363
- That's what he said.

01:02:23.364 --> 01:02:25.949
- Do you think he was telling the truth?

01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:27.159
- I don't know.

01:02:28.869 --> 01:02:29.661
He was,

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.790
he was very charming.

01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:36.209
- Take her home.

01:02:37.294 --> 01:02:38.253
- Excuse me.

01:02:46.178 --> 01:02:48.930
(cat meowing)

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:49.723
- Sheriff?

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:51.850
- Yeah.

01:02:51.850 --> 01:02:54.644
- Will you bring the cat this evening?

01:02:54.645 --> 01:02:55.520
- What for?

01:02:56.814 --> 01:02:58.774
- The cat saved my life.

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:01.193
- OK.

01:03:01.193 --> 01:03:02.152
- Thank you.

01:03:05.197 --> 01:03:07.908
- Do her parents know a class
one assault did not occur?

01:03:07.908 --> 01:03:09.993
- Do you mean she managed
to avoid being raped

01:03:09.994 --> 01:03:11.620
by the bastard, yes.

01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:13.622
- OK.

01:03:14.665 --> 01:03:16.249
- Horace,

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:18.502
don't let her out of your sight.

01:03:18.502 --> 01:03:19.294
- Yepper.

01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:27.094
(cats meowing)

01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:33.934
- Here.

01:03:35.936 --> 01:03:37.479
Drink some of this nice, cold water.

01:03:37.479 --> 01:03:39.647
It'll make you feel better.

01:03:39.648 --> 01:03:42.525
(Charles coughing)

01:03:55.831 --> 01:03:57.749
- I'm dying, Mom.

01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:58.542
- No.

01:04:00.252 --> 01:04:02.462
My boy is not going to die.

01:04:03.422 --> 01:04:04.214
Not ever!

01:04:11.764 --> 01:04:14.475
(sirens wailing)

01:04:41.794 --> 01:04:44.505
(sirens wailing)

01:04:50.094 --> 01:04:52.096
They’re coming.

01:04:52.096 --> 01:04:54.598
I'm going to make us dim, I can do it.

01:04:54.598 --> 01:04:57.642
But you have to keep perfectly quiet.

01:04:59.812 --> 01:05:00.854
- I love you.

01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:06.443
- Quiet, Charles.

01:05:09.196 --> 01:05:11.323
It can still be all right.

01:05:12.866 --> 01:05:13.908
- I'm scared.

01:05:15.035 --> 01:05:16.828
- [Ira] Charles Brady, if you're in there,

01:05:16.829 --> 01:05:19.540
come out with your bands open and empty.

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:20.791
- So scared, Mom.

01:05:20.791 --> 01:05:21.583
- Ssh.

01:05:23.293 --> 01:05:24.585
I have to do us.

01:05:28.632 --> 01:05:29.507
Keep still.

01:05:33.637 --> 01:05:34.429
Dim.

01:05:37.474 --> 01:05:40.685
(soft dramatic theme)

01:05:50.612 --> 01:05:54.907
- [Ira ] Open up, Brady, I'm
in no mood to be polite!

01:05:57.453 --> 01:05:58.996
- Police, bands op!

01:06:01.039 --> 01:06:04.667
Ira, Soames, there's
nothing in the kitchen.

01:06:11.884 --> 01:06:15.220
- I told you to wait on my word.

01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:17.180
- I thought you gave it.

01:06:18.932 --> 01:06:20.099
- A lot of cats.

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:22.936
- Well, I can see that, dickhead.

01:06:22.936 --> 01:06:23.728
- Ab!

01:06:24.771 --> 01:06:27.648
(police clamoring)

01:06:29.067 --> 01:06:29.942
- Aw, shit.

01:06:31.737 --> 01:06:34.489
What a Polish fire
drill, get out of there!

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:37.784
Get back in the damn car, new, move!

01:06:37.784 --> 01:06:38.659
Move, Move!

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:40.995
Move, move!

01:06:42.915 --> 01:06:45.459
(eerie music)

01:06:52.049 --> 01:06:53.633
What?

01:06:53.634 --> 01:06:56.261
- There's a cold draft.

01:06:56.261 --> 01:06:58.805
- Use one right new, could you?

01:07:09.691 --> 01:07:12.151
(eerie music)

01:07:23.163 --> 01:07:26.749
- I'd like to set up
checkpoints in and out of town.

01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:29.461
- The perp's history by now, Ira.

01:07:30.379 --> 01:07:32.672
- He killed one of my men.

01:07:32.673 --> 01:07:36.093
- Look, all you got is
a hysterical little girl

01:07:36.093 --> 01:07:38.929
with a very vivid imagination.

01:07:38.929 --> 01:07:40.138
- What about the cats?

01:07:40.138 --> 01:07:41.806
- What about 'em, Ira?

01:07:41.807 --> 01:07:44.643
Listen, that little girl needs
a good smack on the butt.

01:07:44.643 --> 01:07:47.646
And if her mama and daddy won't do it,

01:07:47.646 --> 01:07:49.522
I'll happily volunteer.

01:07:50.482 --> 01:07:52.859
- Stay away from her, Soames.

01:07:58.031 --> 01:07:59.407
- Hmm.

01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:03.286
This is the best meal I've
had since my wife passed on.

01:08:03.287 --> 01:08:06.248
Boy, if Ira found out, he'd kill me.

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:08.583
- Well, it was already made, Deputy.

01:08:08.584 --> 01:08:11.628
There's one more ear of corn
here, would you like it?

01:08:11.628 --> 01:08:13.171
- Well, yes, ma'am.

01:08:25.517 --> 01:08:28.728
- She's been up there an
awfully long time, boney.

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:29.563
Do you think--

01:08:29.563 --> 01:08:31.898
- She's taking a nice, hot bath.

01:08:31.898 --> 01:08:34.191
She just needs to get clean.

01:08:52.586 --> 01:08:55.296

01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:10.228

01:09:13.398 --> 01:09:15.858
(loud knocking)

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:19.279
- [Mr. Robertson] Honey,
is everything okay?

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:20.947
- Yeah, I'm just getting out.

01:09:20.947 --> 01:09:24.658
- Your mother's keeping
supper warm for you.

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:25.452
Honey?

01:09:26.953 --> 01:09:27.745
- Um,

01:09:29.747 --> 01:09:30.874
thanks, Daddy.

01:09:32.209 --> 01:09:36.421
I just thought I would lie
down for a little while.

01:09:36.421 --> 01:09:39.340
Could you call me when the
sheriff gets here with the cat?

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:40.550
- Yeah, I will.

01:09:41.968 --> 01:09:43.426
I love you, boney.

01:09:45.138 --> 01:09:47.180
- I love you, too, Daddy.

01:09:58.819 --> 01:10:02.280
(door creaking close)

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.572
- What was that?

01:10:09.663 --> 01:10:12.957
(footsteps approaching)

01:10:18.130 --> 01:10:19.256
- Who's there?

01:10:21.133 --> 01:10:22.592
Identify yourself.

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:25.052
Police officers.

01:10:26.471 --> 01:10:28.431
- Maybe it was the wind.

01:10:30.058 --> 01:10:32.518
- It was not the fucking wind.

01:10:40.944 --> 01:10:44.739
- You're right, that was
not the fucking wind.

01:10:47.826 --> 01:10:50.203
(doorbell chiming)

01:10:50.203 --> 01:10:51.537
- Who could that be?

01:10:51.538 --> 01:10:53.248
- Let me take a peek.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.544
(eerie music)

01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:09.055
State police, probably Soames.

01:11:09.973 --> 01:11:10.807
Hope be don't think he's gonna

01:11:10.807 --> 01:11:12.642
question her before Ira gets here.

01:11:12.642 --> 01:11:14.685
(doorbell chiming)

01:11:14.686 --> 01:11:15.978
- I'll get this.

01:11:20.525 --> 01:11:24.070
- Hi, I'm Mary Brady, Charles' mother.

01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:25.905
Charles couldn't come himself.

01:11:25.906 --> 01:11:27.240
- [Mrs. Robertson] Donald, who is it?

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:30.493
- I'll take care of it, Helen,
just stay in the kitchen.

01:11:30.494 --> 01:11:31.620
Look, Mrs. Brady--

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:36.120
- But I know he wanted
you to have these flowers.

01:11:36.291 --> 01:11:39.168
(glass shattering)

01:11:46.051 --> 01:11:46.843
- Donald!

01:11:48.845 --> 01:11:52.890
- You have a lovely home, Mrs. Robertson.

01:11:52.891 --> 01:11:57.061
I've had lovely homes too,
we never stay long, though.

01:11:57.062 --> 01:11:58.229
- Hey!

01:11:58.230 --> 01:12:00.190
You stay away from them!

01:12:02.567 --> 01:12:05.236
- If you would just call
your daughter for me...

01:12:05.237 --> 01:12:06.321
- What?

01:12:06.321 --> 01:12:09.198
- My son is badly hurt, he may be dying.

01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:12.368
Your daughter tried to kill my Charles.

01:12:12.369 --> 01:12:14.662
- Good, I hope be dies!

01:12:14.663 --> 01:12:15.914

I hope you both die and rot in bell !

01:12:19.125 --> 01:12:21.335
- He's my son, my only son!

01:12:26.716 --> 01:12:27.508
- Daddy?

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:30.303
Mom?

01:12:31.346 --> 01:12:33.806

Daddy?

01:12:48.405 --> 01:12:49.864
Ob, my God, Daddy.

01:12:54.119 --> 01:12:55.662

01:13:02.085 --> 01:13:03.669

came from the camera?

01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:05.630
- [Detective] That's it.

01:13:06.756 --> 01:13:09.049
- So was the camera moving or?

01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:13.304
- No, see, the background
and the clothes are in focus.

01:13:13.305 --> 01:13:15.473
Laurie, would you get that damn thing?

01:13:15.473 --> 01:13:18.601
- [ Detective] Take a look at the collar.

01:13:18.602 --> 01:13:20.145
- Sheriff’s Department.

01:13:20.145 --> 01:13:20.979
- Where's Ira?

01:13:20.979 --> 01:13:22.230
- [Laurie] Horace, what's
going on out there?

01:13:22.230 --> 01:13:23.522
- There's a woman here, she says she's

01:13:23.523 --> 01:13:24.941
the Brady kid's mother!

01:13:24.941 --> 01:13:26.859
And I think she killed Don Robertson!

01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:27.777

01:13:27.777 --> 01:13:29.570

(Horace groaning)

01:13:35.702 --> 01:13:37.995
- No vegetables, no dessert.

01:13:39.789 --> 01:13:41.749
Those are the rules.

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:42.917
- Horace!

01:13:42.918 --> 01:13:46.254
- What's going on here, hello Horace?

01:13:46.254 --> 01:13:49.215
Come on, Horace, answer the phone.

01:13:49.215 --> 01:13:50.341

You know what I bet he'd love to do?
