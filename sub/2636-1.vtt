WEBVTT

02:41.041 --> 02:45.415
Her name is Wanda Gruz.
She is your aunt.

02:46.250 --> 02:49.915
We wrote to her many times asking her
to take you.

02:50.583 --> 02:52.040
But she never did.

02:53.208 --> 02:55.124
Maybe she never got the letters?

02:55.875 --> 02:59.790
She did. Because finally she replied
that she couldn't come.

03:00.208 --> 03:03.290
You should meet her before
you take your vows.

03:03.625 --> 03:05.624
She is your only living relative.

03:08.208 --> 03:10.415
Do I have to, Mother?

03:11.125 --> 03:12.207
Yes, Anna.

03:13.833 --> 03:17.957
You will go to see her and stay there
for as long as necessary.

06:11.708 --> 06:12.957
Are you Wanda Gruz?

06:14.166 --> 06:16.207
- I am your niece.
- I know who you are.

06:17.208 --> 06:17.999
Come in.

06:26.291 --> 06:27.415
Are you hungry?

06:27.791 --> 06:28.832
No, thank you.

06:32.416 --> 06:33.124
Take a seat.

06:41.208 --> 06:42.457
What did they tell you about me?

06:43.458 --> 06:45.165
That you are my aunt.

06:48.250 --> 06:49.874
That's all?

06:51.916 --> 06:53.999
They didn't tell you who I am?
What I do?

06:55.625 --> 06:57.124
No.

07:06.333 --> 07:09.957
Why didn't you come to take me from the
orphanage?

07:13.708 --> 07:18.124
I couldn't. I didn't want to.
You wouldn't have been happy with me.

07:19.208 --> 07:20.582
I'm going.

07:20.958 --> 07:22.124
God bless.

07:23.291 --> 07:24.457
God bless you.

07:35.333 --> 07:37.999
So you are a Jewish nun.

07:40.541 --> 07:42.082
Who?

07:47.166 --> 07:48.832
You're a Jew.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.165
They never told you?

07:58.708 --> 08:00.499
Your real name is Ida Lebenstein.

08:01.416 --> 08:04.665
You're the daughter of Haim
Lebenstein and Róża Herc.

08:06.375 --> 08:08.707
You were born in Piaski, near Łomża.

08:18.291 --> 08:19.665
Wait.

08:42.916 --> 08:44.582
This is Róża...

08:45.666 --> 08:47.415
And this is you.

08:51.125 --> 08:53.207
We've had our little family reunion...

08:53.250 --> 08:55.124
I must get dressed. I'm late.

08:59.750 --> 09:00.915
What time is your train?

09:01.166 --> 09:02.415
I have a bus in the evening.

09:03.291 --> 09:04.707
Do you need any money?

09:05.125 --> 09:06.290
No.

09:07.083 --> 09:07.665
Goodbye then.

09:08.083 --> 09:09.207
God be with you.

09:09.625 --> 09:10.874
Goodness.

09:32.166 --> 09:34.707
...a whole bed of red tulips...

09:35.541 --> 09:39.165
...planted by socialist scouts
to honour...

09:42.541 --> 09:46.290
...the accused mowed them down...

09:47.458 --> 09:50.165
...with this here sabre...

09:51.791 --> 09:54.499
...inherited from his grandfather...

09:54.708 --> 09:58.540
...a member of Pilsudski's Legions.

10:45.708 --> 10:48.374
Róża had an artistic soul.
I liked adventures.

10:49.166 --> 10:50.665
We were very different.

10:51.666 --> 10:55.582
She was always making things,
from pieces of cloth or glass.

10:55.833 --> 10:57.999
Once she made a stained glass window...

10:58.041 --> 11:00.957
And put it in the barn
to make the cows happier.

11:02.333 --> 11:03.624
This is your father.

11:06.125 --> 11:10.165
Not an interesting type, a bit primitive.
I didn't like him.

11:11.791 --> 11:14.249
Their whole clan was from there.
We were from Lublin.

11:16.041 --> 11:18.582
Because of him she ended up in that hole.

11:24.666 --> 11:27.374
You have to wear this hood all the time?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.332
You're a redhead too, right?

11:37.166 --> 11:38.374
I had a brother?

11:40.541 --> 11:43.457
No, you were an only child.

11:51.083 --> 11:55.540
I'm going to Piaski tomorrow.
I want to visit their graves.

11:56.541 --> 11:58.415
They have no graves.

12:00.958 --> 12:02.749
Neither they, nor any other Jews.

12:03.416 --> 12:05.457
No one knows where their bodies are...

12:07.458 --> 12:10.082
Maybe in the woods or in the lake.

12:13.083 --> 12:14.540
I'll ask around.

12:17.125 --> 12:21.332
What if you go there
and discover there is no God?

12:26.541 --> 12:28.582
God is everywhere, I know.

12:33.291 --> 12:35.332
I'll drive you there. We'll go together.

13:08.791 --> 13:10.124
You're sweet.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.249
You have such a nice dimple.

13:16.916 --> 13:19.415
Three, when you smile.

13:21.166 --> 13:22.582
Men will go crazy.

13:25.416 --> 13:27.499
Do you have sinful thoughts sometimes?

13:27.875 --> 13:28.707
Yes.

13:31.250 --> 13:32.665
About carnal love?

13:33.375 --> 13:34.540
No.

13:35.875 --> 13:37.207
That's a shame.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.207
You should try...

13:41.250 --> 13:44.540
Otherwise what sort of sacrifice
are these vows of yours.

14:58.541 --> 15:00.124
Praise be to Jesus Christ.

15:00.291 --> 15:01.374
Forever and ever.

15:01.833 --> 15:03.790
You know who lived here before the war?

15:04.041 --> 15:04.915
No.

15:05.458 --> 15:07.082
- Why?
- No reason.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.207
My husband knows...

15:09.333 --> 15:10.957
He'll be back later.

15:11.708 --> 15:13.082
Can we look around?

15:13.541 --> 15:14.374
What for?

15:15.000 --> 15:16.999
Don't worry. We won't steal anything.

15:17.875 --> 15:18.999
I don't know.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.124
Come after tea, around four.

15:32.833 --> 15:34.124
Excuse me.

15:34.458 --> 15:37.124
Could you bless my daughter, sister?

16:24.333 --> 16:25.665
One more, please.

16:32.541 --> 16:34.040
And one for the gentleman over there.

16:52.291 --> 16:53.874
Did you know the Lebensteins?

16:54.666 --> 16:55.915
They lived here before the war.

16:56.125 --> 16:57.290
Jews?

16:57.875 --> 16:59.082
No, Eskimos.

17:01.416 --> 17:03.040
Róża and Haim Lebenstein.

17:03.958 --> 17:06.332
We had a lot of Jews here.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.915
But those I didn't know. Sorry.

17:09.915 --> 17:11.290
Why be sorry?

17:11.958 --> 17:14.499
Jesus, that's just what you say.

17:19.708 --> 17:21.332
Did you know them?

17:33.250 --> 17:34.874
And another one, please.

17:35.791 --> 17:36.999
And the bill.

17:52.916 --> 17:54.915
Our family used to live in this house.

17:58.916 --> 18:00.332
No Jews ever lived here.

18:01.500 --> 18:02.790
I didn't say they were Jews.

18:08.541 --> 18:09.915
It's my house and my land.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.665
We both know who it belonged to.

18:23.291 --> 18:25.707
Your father hid the Lebensteins
during the war. Where?

18:27.791 --> 18:28.790
Where?

18:29.250 --> 18:30.415
In the woods? In some shelter?

18:33.833 --> 18:36.499
I know who denounced Jews
and who helped them.

18:37.166 --> 18:40.249
- Father never went to the Germans.
- I know.

18:41.833 --> 18:42.874
How did they die?

18:47.666 --> 18:49.707
Szymon Skiba, your father.
Where is he?

18:50.875 --> 18:51.707
Don't know.

18:53.208 --> 18:54.707
I know when someone is lying.

18:56.583 --> 18:57.832
I can destroy you.

18:59.541 --> 19:00.749
You have children.

19:04.583 --> 19:05.915
Where is your father?

19:07.083 --> 19:08.290
Don't know.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.165
This is so Róża.

20:05.166 --> 20:07.374
Fancy stained glass next to cow shit.

20:14.583 --> 20:15.999
Here they are...

20:16.791 --> 20:19.707
Good Christians... your neighbours.

20:20.541 --> 20:22.207
Your mates are here.

21:22.500 --> 21:23.790
When did you start drinking?

21:25.625 --> 21:27.332
When I was about twelve.

21:27.541 --> 21:31.124
Listen, you can make things easy
for yourself or hard.

21:31.666 --> 21:33.207
Listen, comrade...

21:34.416 --> 21:36.832
It would easier if
you showed some respect.

21:37.250 --> 21:40.415
You have to let me go.
I have immunity. I am a judge.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.082
Lock her up.

21:43.166 --> 21:44.707
Will you be all right?

21:44.791 --> 21:45.582
Let's go.

21:45.708 --> 21:47.999
They'll let me out tomorrow.

21:49.041 --> 21:49.915
Immunity...

21:54.583 --> 21:56.040
No, I didn't know them.

21:57.625 --> 21:59.124
Jews usually kept to themselves.

22:09.791 --> 22:11.332
Were you here during the war?

22:12.375 --> 22:13.499
I was.

22:14.958 --> 22:18.124
Do you have some connection
to them, sister?

22:21.208 --> 22:22.332
No, nothing.

22:28.166 --> 22:30.832
I'm sorry but this is all I can offer.

22:33.375 --> 22:35.499
- Good night, sister.
- Good night.

22:36.166 --> 22:37.957
- God be with you.
- God be with you.

22:38.666 --> 22:39.832
Thank you.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.207
I hope you will accept our apologies,
comrade.

23:14.708 --> 23:19.124
- It was for your own good. You were indisposed.
- Go to hell.

23:20.291 --> 23:21.540
Safe journey.

23:48.875 --> 23:50.290
Who are you?

23:57.625 --> 23:58.874
Nobody these days...

24:01.166 --> 24:03.165
But I used to be a state prosecutor once.

24:04.833 --> 24:06.624
Big public trials.

24:10.875 --> 24:13.040
I even sent a few people to death.

24:19.916 --> 24:20.874
Who?

24:22.375 --> 24:24.207
Enemies of the People.

24:24.416 --> 24:26.749
This was in the early fifties.

24:29.958 --> 24:31.957
Red Wanda - that's me.

24:35.333 --> 24:37.290
Gone with the wind.

24:37.625 --> 24:39.624
Want a doughnut?

24:59.166 --> 25:01.457
What'll happen when we find this Szymon?

25:05.083 --> 25:07.915
He'll tell us how your parents died
and where they're buried.

25:09.791 --> 25:11.165
That's what you wanted, no?

26:03.750 --> 26:05.082
- Where are you going?
- To Szydłów.

26:05.666 --> 26:06.665
So are we.

26:08.916 --> 26:10.290
Cigarette?

26:16.250 --> 26:17.457
Where can you get these?

26:18.708 --> 26:20.124
State secret.

26:22.500 --> 26:23.915
What's in the case? A saxophone?

26:24.750 --> 26:25.665
Yes. Alto.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.415
Beautiful instrument.

26:29.083 --> 26:30.124
Male, sensuous.

26:34.375 --> 26:35.624
Do you live in Szydłów?

26:35.833 --> 26:37.249
No. We're doing a gig there.

26:37.416 --> 26:39.124
To celebrate the town's anniversary.

26:40.833 --> 26:41.540
And you?

26:49.583 --> 26:52.707
Will you come to the dance tonight?
Might be fun.

26:53.291 --> 26:54.415
Why not.

26:54.541 --> 26:55.874
Thanks.

27:23.583 --> 27:25.582
Not bad, our lad.

27:34.541 --> 27:36.832
Do you know Szymon Skiba?
He lives around here.

27:37.500 --> 27:38.707
Skiba? No.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.332
But ask Marek at the bar.

27:44.375 --> 27:46.957
He knows everyone. Ask him.

28:51.666 --> 28:53.457
- He's not here.
- When's he back?

28:54.083 --> 28:56.499
- They took him to the hospital with...
- When's he back?

28:56.750 --> 28:59.957
Tomorrow. Or later...
God willing.

29:08.125 --> 29:10.207
Maybe he's hiding from us.

29:36.875 --> 29:39.207
- Cold.
- What?

29:39.666 --> 29:40.665
Cold.

29:43.291 --> 29:44.457
Where is He?

29:58.166 --> 29:59.582
Which one do you want?

30:01.625 --> 30:02.624
Neither.

30:03.666 --> 30:07.374
Come on, you won't stop being a nun.

30:08.291 --> 30:10.124
Your Jesus didn't hide
in a cave with books...

30:10.250 --> 30:12.124
But went out into the world.

30:13.333 --> 30:14.332
I'm not going anywhere.

30:15.000 --> 30:15.915
What?

30:16.750 --> 30:18.624
I'm not going anywhere.

30:19.541 --> 30:21.332
Fine, I'll have fun on my own.

32:36.708 --> 32:38.207
C'est la vie.

32:50.250 --> 32:53.165
I thought we were here
because of my parents.

33:00.375 --> 33:01.915
We are.

33:15.541 --> 33:17.207
I loved Róża very much.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.165
You are so similar.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.999
I won't let you waste your life.

33:44.666 --> 33:45.749
Of course...

33:48.375 --> 33:50.957
I'm a slut and you're a little saint.

34:06.041 --> 34:10.498
This Jesus of yours adored people like me.

34:21.541 --> 34:22.956
Take Mary Magdalen...

34:27.375 --> 34:29.331
Let's have a read.

34:37.708 --> 34:40.581
What a beast came out.

36:14.791 --> 36:16.832
What was that you played?

36:17.625 --> 36:21.582
Naima by Coltrane. Did you like it?

36:22.250 --> 36:23.165
Very much.

36:29.833 --> 36:31.124
You're a funny couple.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.624
My aunt and me?

36:34.125 --> 36:35.290
I know.

36:35.750 --> 36:37.332
We only met two days ago.

36:40.541 --> 36:41.790
Where are you from?

36:42.500 --> 36:43.957
From a village. Not far from here.

36:44.833 --> 36:46.749
But I was raised in a convent.

36:51.166 --> 36:53.207
And now I'm Jewish, too.

36:56.166 --> 36:58.624
And I've got some gypsy in me.

37:02.291 --> 37:03.374
So why are you here?

37:05.250 --> 37:07.707
I'm looking for a man who knew my parents.

37:21.666 --> 37:23.707
Thank you.

38:33.125 --> 38:35.040
He's probably still in the hospital.

38:41.875 --> 38:44.040
I'll wait downstairs.

39:36.750 --> 39:38.082
Let's go.

40:25.166 --> 40:26.415
Remember me?

40:40.583 --> 40:42.749
You knew the Lebensteins during the war.

40:43.958 --> 40:45.665
We'd like to know where they're buried.

40:47.083 --> 40:48.790
I'm their daughter.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.082
Róża.

40:55.458 --> 40:57.207
I'm Ida.

41:02.750 --> 41:04.124
They were...

41:05.333 --> 41:07.040
Good people...

41:10.000 --> 41:11.957
I hid them in the woods...

41:15.625 --> 41:17.124
Fed them...

41:17.875 --> 41:20.082
And then you killed them.

41:34.416 --> 41:36.207
Was he very scared?

41:39.208 --> 41:40.499
Who?

41:48.291 --> 41:49.082
The boy.

42:14.625 --> 42:16.124
How did you do it?

42:22.708 --> 42:24.082
With an axe?

42:51.541 --> 42:53.624
I left him with Róża...

43:02.458 --> 43:03.957
And went to fight...

43:08.291 --> 43:09.624
For God knows what.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.957
I hardly knew him.

44:28.166 --> 44:29.457
Praise be to God.

44:44.333 --> 44:47.290
Leave my father alone,
let him die in peace.

44:50.041 --> 44:51.915
Nobody can prove anything anyway.

44:53.416 --> 44:54.707
What happened, happened.

44:55.625 --> 44:56.499
What do you want?

44:59.916 --> 45:04.707
You give up claims to the house
and I'll show you where they're buried...

45:08.208 --> 45:09.624
And you leave us in peace.

45:14.708 --> 45:15.957
Deal?

45:17.833 --> 45:18.665
Yes.

45:25.875 --> 45:26.957
Good.

45:28.541 --> 45:29.957
See you tomorrow.

45:31.083 --> 45:32.915
I know I can trust you, sister.

46:32.083 --> 46:32.957
So?

46:34.291 --> 46:36.415
Did you find that man?

46:37.458 --> 46:38.374
Yes.

46:49.291 --> 46:50.290
What now?

46:52.625 --> 46:54.290
You're going back to the institution?

46:56.166 --> 46:59.290
You mean the convent? Yes.

47:00.375 --> 47:02.165
For long?

47:03.416 --> 47:04.582
Forever.

47:09.750 --> 47:11.749
I'm taking my vows next week.

47:21.666 --> 47:23.582
And you?

47:25.708 --> 47:28.915
I'm mainly trying to avoid the army.

47:30.875 --> 47:32.040
And vows too.

47:44.666 --> 47:47.457
You've no idea of the effect
you have, do you?

51:45.375 --> 51:46.665
And me?

51:47.333 --> 51:49.124
Why am I not here?

51:59.000 --> 52:00.124
You were tiny...

52:02.625 --> 52:04.415
No one would know you were Jewish.

52:07.250 --> 52:10.082
I took you to the priest
and left you there.

52:13.958 --> 52:17.582
The boy was dark and circumcised.

52:22.208 --> 52:23.665
It wasn't father...

52:25.625 --> 52:27.165
I killed them.

54:02.750 --> 54:05.040
We'll go to Lublin.

54:08.083 --> 54:10.040
We have a family grave there.

54:11.958 --> 54:14.207
If that graveyard still exists.

54:19.166 --> 54:20.374
We should find a priest.

54:21.416 --> 54:23.207
You mean a rabbi.

54:25.541 --> 54:27.040
Don't drink now.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.457
It's a long way, I'll sober up.

57:41.250 --> 57:43.665
Will you come to my vows?

57:45.791 --> 57:48.207
No, but I'll drink to your health.

58:12.625 --> 58:14.957
It's a pity Róża couldn't see you.

59:18.416 --> 59:20.040
So?

01:00:56.541 --> 01:01:02.124
Our Father who art in heaven,
Hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come...

01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:37.832
I'm not ready.

01:01:38.083 --> 01:01:40.082
Forgive me.

01:02:12.583 --> 01:02:16.457
In front of all you sisters gathered here
and you Mother Superior...

01:02:16.791 --> 01:02:21.707
I vow chastity, poverty and
obedience...

01:02:22.791 --> 01:02:26.665
Do not despise, Lord,
this heart, repentant and humble.

01:03:35.291 --> 01:03:37.124
Do you have a car?

01:03:38.625 --> 01:03:40.207
Of course.

01:03:42.125 --> 01:03:43.957
Will you drive me home?

01:03:47.083 --> 01:03:49.165
Not now. Sit down.

01:04:02.291 --> 01:04:04.540
She has such beautiful hair.

01:04:06.791 --> 01:04:09.040
But she hides it away.

01:04:11.416 --> 01:04:12.999
Who?

01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:18.249
Ida.

01:10:26.958 --> 01:10:30.749
Comrade Wanda Gruz contributed greatly...

01:10:32.083 --> 01:10:34.540
To the creation of a new Poland...

01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:38.832
Tenaciously exercising People's justice...

01:10:47.958 --> 01:10:49.124
...farewell comrade...

01:10:49.666 --> 01:10:51.957
You'll live forever in our memory.

01:14:06.458 --> 01:14:07.874
What are you thinking about?

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:09.624
I'm not thinking.

01:14:13.333 --> 01:14:16.790
We're off to Gdańsk to do some gigs.
Wanna come?

01:14:19.083 --> 01:14:20.332
Ever been to the seaside?

01:14:21.416 --> 01:14:22.540
I haven't been anywhere.

01:14:23.083 --> 01:14:24.415
Come along, then...

01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:29.624
You'll listen to us play,
we'll walk on the beach.

01:14:31.208 --> 01:14:32.374
And then?

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.290
Then we'll buy a dog...

01:14:47.958 --> 01:14:49.999
Get married, have children...

01:14:51.166 --> 01:14:52.290
Get a house.

01:14:52.875 --> 01:14:54.207
And then?

01:14:58.833 --> 01:15:01.457
The usual. Life.
