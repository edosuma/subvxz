00:09.500 --> 00:12.120
Hey, thanks again
for letting us leave early.

00:12.120 --> 00:14.830
Why exactly are you
letting us leave early?

00:14.830 --> 00:16.540
You know what, never mind,
I'm not gonna bring it up,

00:16.540 --> 00:19.580
because then you might
change your mind, and I...
want to leave early.

00:20.580 --> 00:21.880
You sure you don't wanna
come with us

00:21.880 --> 00:24.170
to this off the chain
club opening?

00:24.170 --> 00:27.170
I can get another VIP pass,
because I am a PR god.

00:27.170 --> 00:29.120
Thanks, Elliot,
but I have a college buddy
comin' over for dinner.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.250
You guys go. Have fun.

00:31.250 --> 00:34.500
Oh, I will.
I plan on gettin' kicked out
of the club tonight...

00:34.500 --> 00:36.080
and someone's bed
in the morning.

00:37.960 --> 00:39.960
Okay, so the lobster ravioli
is warming on the stove,

00:39.960 --> 00:41.250
the side dishes
are in the oven,

00:41.250 --> 00:43.170
and then there's
cream pie for dessert.

00:43.170 --> 00:44.540
Ooh, Boston?

00:44.540 --> 00:46.000
No, right there in the fridge.

00:47.250 --> 00:49.580
Okay, so are you sure
you don't need me?

00:49.580 --> 00:51.250
Gabi, stop worrying.
We're probably just gonna

00:51.250 --> 00:53.210
end up drinkin' beer
and eatin' ravioli

00:53.210 --> 00:54.460
right outta the pot.

00:54.460 --> 00:56.080
Pot! That's what I'm missin'.

00:59.250 --> 01:01.420
How great is it
that Josh is giving us
the night off early?

01:01.420 --> 01:04.080
-Mm-hm.
-Why do you think
he's doing that?

01:04.080 --> 01:07.460
Girl, let it go.
Don't look a gift horse
in the mouth.

01:07.460 --> 01:09.210
You tell her, Seabiscuit.

01:15.540 --> 01:18.290
Um... who are you
and why are you going here?

01:18.290 --> 01:22.120
Uh... this is the penthouse,
right? I'm going to...
Josh Kaminski's?

01:22.120 --> 01:23.500
Yeah, and why is that?

01:23.500 --> 01:25.330
He... hired me to serve him
and his guest dinner?

01:25.330 --> 01:27.120
And why is that?

01:27.120 --> 01:28.960
Wouldn't you want
a professional server

01:28.960 --> 01:31.380
if you were having
a business dinner
with Natasha Cook Campbell?

01:31.380 --> 01:33.790

Okay, you know
I'm obsessed

02:15.250 --> 02:16.380
with Natasha Cook Campbell.

02:16.380 --> 02:17.880
I mean, she's a genius cook,

02:17.880 --> 02:18.960
brilliant businesswoman,

02:18.960 --> 02:21.000
she's best friends with Yeezy.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.210
She's everything I wanna be,

02:22.210 --> 02:24.210
except for the... little bit
of jail time.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.250
I don't-- I don't understand

02:25.250 --> 02:26.540
why you wouldn't want me
to meet her?

02:26.540 --> 02:27.620
'Cause of this.

02:27.620 --> 02:28.710
What?

02:28.710 --> 02:29.830
Look at you!

02:29.830 --> 02:31.080
You're an obsessed nut job!

02:31.080 --> 02:32.750
I'm trying to do a business deal
with Natasha,

02:32.750 --> 02:34.540
and the last thing I need
is some crackpot

02:34.540 --> 02:37.710
trying to steal a lock
of her hair!

02:37.710 --> 02:39.120
I'm sorry, Gabi,
I can't trust you

02:39.120 --> 02:40.250
to act professionally.

02:40.250 --> 02:42.620
Can't trust--
You can't trust me?

02:42.620 --> 02:43.710
Can I just say

02:43.710 --> 02:45.120
that if we were
in a relationship,

02:45.120 --> 02:46.620
I would be so hurt.

02:46.620 --> 02:48.120
Can I just say
this is precisely

02:48.120 --> 02:49.250
why we're
not in a relationship.

02:49.250 --> 02:52.120
Oh, well, can I just say
I'm hurt anyway.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.170
(knock on door)

02:54.170 --> 02:56.330
A multi-million dollar deal
is on the line.

02:56.330 --> 02:59.000
I know... and as soon
as I get a lock of her hair,

02:59.000 --> 03:00.540
-I will be totally
professional--
-Oh my god--

03:00.540 --> 03:03.080
I'm kidding!

03:03.080 --> 03:05.830
I'm gonna be a hundred percent
pro-fesh. Now excuse me,

03:05.830 --> 03:07.500
I have a door to answer.

03:11.460 --> 03:12.750
Welcome, Ms. Cook Campbell.

03:12.750 --> 03:14.790
Ms. Cook Campbell,
I'm Josh Kaminski.

03:14.790 --> 03:16.290
Call me Natasha.

03:16.290 --> 03:19.290
Natasha...
(whispers) Cook Campbell.

03:22.290 --> 03:25.250
Ooh, Elliot, tonight
you went from schmuck

03:25.250 --> 03:27.500
to guy I wanna-- uch, too far.

03:28.880 --> 03:31.920
But still, I'm impressed
you were able to get us tickets.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.000
When you're as well known

03:33.000 --> 03:34.080
as me in the biz,

03:34.080 --> 03:36.540
you ask and... (snaps fingers)

03:36.540 --> 03:38.580
things happen.

03:38.580 --> 03:41.120
Hey, Elliot, do you know
who the surprise guest is yet?

03:41.120 --> 03:43.880
Is it T. Swift?
J. Cole? R. Kelly?

03:43.880 --> 03:47.710
Aww, it's so cute
when the nothings
get excited.

03:47.710 --> 03:49.000
(phone ringing)

03:49.000 --> 03:50.330
Oh, it's the club.

03:51.750 --> 03:53.750
Yes, this is Elliot Park.

03:53.750 --> 03:54.960
Mm-hmm?

03:56.120 --> 03:59.750
The surprise guest
is who now?

03:59.750 --> 04:05.290
-It's Beyonce!
It's Beyonce! It's Beyonce!
-(others freaking out)

04:05.290 --> 04:09.250
Sofia and Yolanda:
Elliot! Elliot! Elliot!

04:09.250 --> 04:13.080
Hold on a second,
I can't hear you.
People are chanting my name.

04:15.380 --> 04:19.540
You were saying
tonight's gonna be busy,
and... what?

04:19.540 --> 04:21.880
You can no longer
accommodate me?

04:21.880 --> 04:23.960
But you have to!

04:23.960 --> 04:27.210
For the first time
in my life, people
are worshiping me.

04:27.210 --> 04:29.120
I'll do anything!

04:29.120 --> 04:30.880
I cannot be a nothing!

04:32.420 --> 04:34.290
Hello?

04:34.290 --> 04:35.210
Oh, no.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.830
So, are we ready to roll?

04:38.830 --> 04:41.040
Actually, there's been
an unexpected development.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.380
I knew
you wouldn't come through.

04:42.380 --> 04:45.080
Why would you all of a sudden
be "the man"?

04:45.080 --> 04:48.040
They... upgraded us
to the front row!

04:48.040 --> 04:51.040
I knew you'd come through
'cause you the man!

04:51.040 --> 04:53.080
Beyonce's gonna sweat
on us! Let's go!

04:53.080 --> 04:56.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You wanna go now?

04:56.250 --> 04:59.080
So we can be the first ones
there, and look like losers?

04:59.080 --> 05:01.580
How many times have you two
been VIPs at a club?

05:01.580 --> 05:02.750
Both:
Never.

05:02.750 --> 05:05.500
Take it from a VIP OG.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.380
Beyonce's not gonna go on
until midnight.

05:07.380 --> 05:10.290
The cool people show up
at 11:45.

05:10.290 --> 05:12.920
And you know what's better
than seeing Beyonce?

05:12.920 --> 05:14.080
Huh! Nothing!

05:14.080 --> 05:16.330
Wrong!
Drinking free booze here,

05:16.330 --> 05:18.290
instead of paying
at the club!

05:18.290 --> 05:21.170
Aw, yeah, you know
they do overcharge.

05:21.170 --> 05:22.460
And water it down.

05:22.460 --> 05:23.580
Exactly.

05:23.580 --> 05:26.500
This'll be the night...
we never... forget.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.790
Or hopefully
never remember, what?

05:34.420 --> 05:36.620
Natasha,
at Kaminski Enterprises,

05:36.620 --> 05:39.120
you're getting more
than just an app.
We're gonna take your books,

05:39.120 --> 05:42.920
your videos and your recipes,
and tie them all together
into one digital portal.

05:42.920 --> 05:45.420
Hmmm. I need
to run this by Kiki.

05:45.420 --> 05:47.120
What?
You're Natasha Cook Campbell,

05:47.120 --> 05:48.790
you don't have to run things
by anybody.

05:48.790 --> 05:52.580
Well, no one...
except Kiki Cook Campbell.

05:54.790 --> 05:58.000
She's the only bitch
I listen to.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.120
(barks)

05:59.120 --> 06:01.670
Kiki, inside bark!

06:01.670 --> 06:06.120
She's like a daughter to me...
except she's actually
in my will.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.460
Look, Josh, I'm gonna
be blunt.

06:09.460 --> 06:12.120
A little Tash talk,
if you will.

06:13.500 --> 06:17.620
You've pitched me the same thing
as every other pasty tech mogul
in town.

06:17.620 --> 06:20.040
I want to attract
a new demographic.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.500
How are you gonna
take my "Get Paid" chicken

06:22.500 --> 06:25.170
and introduce it
to the younger generation?

06:25.170 --> 06:26.710
Your "Get Paid" chicken?

06:26.710 --> 06:27.830
Mm-hm.

06:27.830 --> 06:29.120
(stammers)

06:29.120 --> 06:30.830
It's only her best recipe!

06:30.830 --> 06:33.120
It's called "Get Paid" chicken
because when you finally
get your paycheck,

06:33.120 --> 06:34.710
you can afford to cook yourself
a good meal.

06:34.710 --> 06:37.080
(gasps)
Um, can I just say,

06:37.080 --> 06:38.580
I actually-- I don't call it
"Get Paid" chicken,

06:38.580 --> 06:40.210
because when I cook it
for a date, it's such a hit,

06:40.210 --> 06:42.460
-I call it
"Get Laid" chicken!
-Gabi!

06:42.460 --> 06:45.040
-"Get Laid"?
-Natasha, I am so sorry.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.290
I love it!

06:46.290 --> 06:50.000
I have been trying
to hip up everything.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.330
Two years ago I rejuvenated
my lady business,

06:53.330 --> 06:57.120
and it's ideas like that
that can rejuvenate
my business business!

06:57.120 --> 07:00.830
Natasha,
you wanna know what separates me
from the other pasty people?

07:00.830 --> 07:02.540
Gabi Diamond!

07:02.540 --> 07:06.710
She's a great chef,
beautiful, young,
and oh, so fun!

07:06.710 --> 07:08.620
Gabi, I have a great feeling
about you.

07:08.620 --> 07:12.210
I think
you and I are gonna be
writing a cookbook together.

07:14.540 --> 07:17.460
I'm sorry,
I just blacked out
for a moment.

07:17.460 --> 07:20.170
You-- You wanna
write a cookbook with me?

07:20.170 --> 07:24.000
Yes, you have a raw,
sexy energy that I want
in my books!

07:24.000 --> 07:28.210
And you were smart enough
to hire her. The contract
is yours.

07:28.210 --> 07:29.710
(phone rings)

07:29.710 --> 07:31.670
Oh, this is
the fifth time my editor
is calling me tonight.

07:31.670 --> 07:34.460
Now she could use some
of that "Get Laid" chicken.

07:34.460 --> 07:37.120
-Natasha, why don't you
take it in my office?
-Oh, okay.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.080
Hello?

07:39.710 --> 07:41.540
(singsong)
I'm writing a book
with Natasha Cook Campbell!

07:41.540 --> 07:43.170
(singsong)
I'm doin' a digital platform!

07:43.170 --> 07:45.500
Oh my god...
could things get any better?

07:45.500 --> 07:47.250
We're a power non-couple!

07:48.830 --> 07:51.170
Oh, Kiki,
I almost stepped on you!

07:51.170 --> 07:53.120
Can you imagine
if I stepped on Kiki
Cook Campbell,

07:53.120 --> 07:54.670
who Natasha Cook Campbell
loves more

07:54.670 --> 07:56.120
than her own daughter?
(laughs)

07:56.120 --> 07:57.580
-(barking)
-Stop!

07:57.580 --> 08:00.000
-(barking)
-Kiki, stop-- (gasps)
You want your ball?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.330
Do you want your ball?

08:01.330 --> 08:04.120
Here you go!
Here's your ball,
go get it!

08:04.120 --> 08:05.120
(barks)

08:07.170 --> 08:09.040
Both:
Nooooo!

08:10.670 --> 08:12.960
Why would you throw
a dog's ball over the terrace?

08:12.960 --> 08:15.210
I didn't throw it
over the terrace,
I threw it towards the terrace.

08:15.210 --> 08:18.790
How was I supposed to know
that balls bounce?

08:18.790 --> 08:20.290
I can't see her anywhere.

08:20.290 --> 08:23.380
Yeah... 'cause
she's in heaven.

08:23.380 --> 08:25.380
This is horrible!

08:25.380 --> 08:26.750
Oh my god, she saw.

08:26.750 --> 08:29.500
My editor was in a car accident,
I have to get to the hospital.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.250
-Oh, thank God.
-Oh, that's fantastic.

08:31.250 --> 08:33.710
-That is tragic!
-Horrible!

08:33.710 --> 08:36.170
All right, now where is Kiki?

08:36.170 --> 08:40.000
Uhh... uhh... say, Gabi,
where is Kiki?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.290
-Oh... look!
Here she is.
-(toy rattling)

08:42.290 --> 08:44.120
Oh, Kiki, time to go.

08:44.120 --> 08:47.380
Oh, look-- look at that,
she's following me,
that's so cute.

08:47.380 --> 08:49.080
Come here, Kiki,
come here, Kiki...

08:49.080 --> 08:50.120
Kiki, now!

08:52.290 --> 08:55.040
Oh! Here's a thought.
Why don't Josh and I
watch her,

08:55.040 --> 08:56.250
and you can just
come pick her up later?

08:56.250 --> 09:00.830
-Ohh!
-Oh, g-- I could never
leave my baby.

09:00.830 --> 09:06.170
But she is my editor.
Oh, God, it's Natasha's choice.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.170
(crying)

09:08.170 --> 09:10.250
Did that seem real?

09:10.250 --> 09:13.080
Because that's what I'm gonna do
when they take my picture
outside the hospital.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.750
That-- It was great.
It was really great!

09:14.750 --> 09:17.920
So believable.
We will watch Kiki. Bye!

09:17.920 --> 09:20.750
Wow. This was
a really great night.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.250
Well, except for my editor,

09:22.250 --> 09:24.920
who they think could be dead
by the time I get there.

09:24.920 --> 09:27.040
(dramatically)
No! Not Diana!

09:27.040 --> 09:30.500
Noooo! Okay, that one
might've been a little bit
over the top.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.540
I'm not gonna do that one.

09:31.540 --> 09:33.210
I'm gonna go practice
in the elevator.

09:34.210 --> 09:36.210
All right, watch my baby
for me, please.

09:36.210 --> 09:38.120
-Okay, we will!
-Bye.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.120
Bye!

09:45.920 --> 09:50.120
In honor of Beyonce,
all the single ladies
do a shot!

09:50.120 --> 09:51.170
Yeah!

09:53.040 --> 09:55.210
Now all the divorced ladies
do two!

09:56.170 --> 09:58.380
(laughs)
My divorce was pretty rough.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.880
I'll take three!
(laughs)

10:00.880 --> 10:02.790
Kendrick? It's Sofia.

10:02.790 --> 10:05.210
Eh-- Even though this might
make things awkward at work,

10:05.210 --> 10:07.540
I have to say...
I love you.

10:07.540 --> 10:10.540
-And I wanna suck--
-Okay!

10:10.540 --> 10:12.500
-We're drunk enough to go.
-(laughs)

10:12.500 --> 10:15.000
Waaait!

10:15.000 --> 10:18.210
You're gonna let Beyonce
see you bitches
without volume?

10:18.210 --> 10:19.620
Hair flip!

10:24.620 --> 10:26.420
Okay, let's go.

10:28.880 --> 10:32.580
Wait a second.
It's only 9:00.

10:32.580 --> 10:34.830
What did I say before, nothings?

10:34.830 --> 10:36.540
-Don't show up early.
-Or we'll look like losers.

10:36.540 --> 10:39.250
Exactly. So what do we do
while we wait?

10:39.250 --> 10:41.330
-Beyonce-tinis!
-A-ha!

10:41.330 --> 10:42.880
Atta girls!

10:48.580 --> 10:50.170
Did you find Kiki?
Tell me you found Kiki.

10:50.170 --> 10:51.580
I found her.
I found her.

10:51.580 --> 10:53.750
A whole Kiki,
or in Kiki pieces?

10:53.750 --> 10:55.920
Whole Kiki.
Whole Kiki.

10:55.920 --> 10:58.120
How-- How the hell
did she survive?

10:58.120 --> 11:01.000
Well, she miraculously
landed on this.

11:04.710 --> 11:07.790
Uh, Louis, this is Josh.
Josh, this is Louis.

11:07.790 --> 11:09.040
-Wow.
-Kiki, thank God--

11:09.040 --> 11:12.250
Nice place. What do you
do for a livin'? Work?

11:12.250 --> 11:16.500
And like I told the blonde here,
this isn't Kiki, this is Wagon.

11:16.500 --> 11:21.500
-What?
-Damn, Wagon.
Can you believe this place?

11:21.500 --> 11:23.460
Look at the size
of that ottoman!

11:23.460 --> 11:25.210
You still have the box
it came in?

11:26.540 --> 11:29.250
-What's going on here?
-Okay, so, I tried to tell Louis

11:29.250 --> 11:31.040
that Kiki was Natasha's dog,

11:31.040 --> 11:32.750
but he insisted
that that was "Wagon,"

11:32.750 --> 11:35.330
short for "Off the Wagon,"
which he clearly is.

11:36.960 --> 11:39.750
Okay... how much for the dog?

11:39.750 --> 11:41.170
Excuse me?

11:41.170 --> 11:42.750
Businessman to con man,
how much do you want
for Kiki?

11:42.750 --> 11:44.750
-Five thousand?
-I told you, this isn't Kiki,

11:44.750 --> 11:47.040
this is Wagon, and Wagon
is not for sale.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.500
-Ten thousand.
-You know...
this nice young lady invited me

11:50.500 --> 11:52.420
up for a home-cooked meal
out of the kindness
of her heart,

11:52.420 --> 11:55.580
and here you are,
flashing all your money,
trying to separate me

11:55.580 --> 11:57.080
from my only friend
in the world.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.790
-Twenty thousand.
-Heeeeere's Wagon!

12:04.250 --> 12:06.290
Hey, uh, Louis...
do you--

12:06.290 --> 12:09.250
Wanna go out with you?
Nah! I'm rich now.
I got options.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.670
Here ya go!

12:13.670 --> 12:15.880
Oh my god. Josh,
you just have that kinda money
lying around?

12:15.880 --> 12:18.250
Gabi, I'm rich.
I have lots of money
in my office.

12:18.250 --> 12:21.710
Next to
my full-time security guard.
Big guy, big, big guy!

12:21.710 --> 12:23.880
Anyway... buh-bye, Louis.

12:23.880 --> 12:26.040
Well... take good care
of Wagon now.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.210
I'm off to the bank...
or a race track.

12:30.210 --> 12:33.170
Ha! Oh my god!
We got Kiki back!

12:33.170 --> 12:35.290
We got Kiki baaack!

12:36.540 --> 12:37.790
Why aren't you happy?

12:37.790 --> 12:40.420
Uh, do you not remember
that you just cost me
$20,000?

12:40.420 --> 12:42.500
Do you not remember
how we thought Kiki was dead,

12:42.500 --> 12:44.210
and now she's alive,
and she's here?

12:44.210 --> 12:46.170
Do you not remember
how none of this
would've happened

12:46.170 --> 12:48.080
-if you just went
to that stupid club.
-Okay, can we not do

12:48.080 --> 12:51.120
the "do you not remembers"
because I think
we all remembers.

12:51.120 --> 12:54.250
Oh, especially the one
where Natasha was out the door

12:54.250 --> 12:55.880
until I brought up
"Get Laid" chicken!

12:55.880 --> 12:57.880
I mean, if it wasn't for me,
you'd have nothing!

12:57.880 --> 13:01.620
Oh, right... because I didn't
have my penthouse or--
or my company,

13:01.620 --> 13:04.120
or my millions
before you rhymed
"paid" with "laid"!

13:04.120 --> 13:07.080
-Oh my god,
you are being so--
-(dog barks)

13:07.080 --> 13:08.790
Kiki! Kiki, stop!

13:08.790 --> 13:10.040
Kiki, get off!

13:10.040 --> 13:12.880
-Do you want your ball?
Yeah, okay!
-(dog barks)

13:12.880 --> 13:15.080
-Okay,
come get your ball--
-Stop! Stop!

13:15.080 --> 13:17.710
Have you learned nothing?

13:17.710 --> 13:19.880
You do not throw balls
towards the terrace!

13:21.960 --> 13:23.250
-No!
-No!

13:23.250 --> 13:26.580
Okay... at a certain point,
it's the dog's fault!

13:30.000 --> 13:32.330
Ohhhh, she's gone
this time, Gabi!

13:32.330 --> 13:34.080
She's gone, baby, gone!

13:34.080 --> 13:37.620
It's dead!
My cookbook deal
is dead!

13:37.620 --> 13:39.120
(phone ringing)

13:40.710 --> 13:42.120
Oh my god,
Natasha's face-timing you!

13:42.120 --> 13:44.580
-I'm not answering it!
-Okay, but if you don't answer,
she's gonna think

13:44.580 --> 13:46.670
-something
horrible happened to Kiki.
-Well, if I do answer it,

13:46.670 --> 13:48.380
she's gonna know something
horrible happened to Kiki.

13:48.380 --> 13:49.920
Okay, I'm just gonna
hit ignore. Dammit!

13:49.920 --> 13:52.380
I hit accept,
I do that all the time.

13:52.380 --> 13:54.670
Hi, Natasha!

13:54.670 --> 13:57.500
Hi, how's my little angel?
Would you put her
on the phone?

13:57.500 --> 13:59.920
-I wanna see her face.
-(very quickly) Tell her
I took Kiki on a walk!

13:59.920 --> 14:01.500
-What?
-Tell her I took Kiki
for a walk!

14:01.500 --> 14:03.120
I don't know
what you're saying,
you tell her.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.500
I took Kiki
for a walk!

14:04.500 --> 14:07.000
And because I'm talking to you
right now, because Gabi
gave me the phone,

14:07.000 --> 14:08.170
that must mean
I'm back with Kiki!

14:08.170 --> 14:10.830
-(barking)
-Oh, I hear her!

14:10.830 --> 14:12.880
-(barking)
-My god. I hear her, too.

14:12.880 --> 14:16.330
-I hear her, too.
-She alive... force!

14:16.330 --> 14:19.210
She's a life force,
just perks up everything
around her.

14:19.210 --> 14:20.580
We adore her.

14:20.580 --> 14:23.330
Aw. Well, tell her
Mommy's on her way
to pick her back up,

14:23.330 --> 14:25.880
-And I love her--
-Okay, bye-bye!

14:25.880 --> 14:27.330
Oh my god, she's here!
She's here!

14:27.330 --> 14:29.250
-(whistling)
-(gasps)

14:29.250 --> 14:31.120
Oh my god,
she's on the terrace
below us,

14:31.120 --> 14:33.250
she must've
hit the awning and slid off
onto the balcony,

14:33.250 --> 14:34.670
-we gotta go get her!
-We-- We can't just

14:34.670 --> 14:36.330
go into the apartment,
it's empty, it's for sale.

14:36.330 --> 14:38.880
-Well, can't you just buy it?
-It takes a little longer

14:38.880 --> 14:41.000
than five minutes to purchase
real estate!

14:41.000 --> 14:44.790
Excuse me for being a renter!
Can I just say once again

14:44.790 --> 14:47.080
how glad I am we are not
in a relationship?

14:47.080 --> 14:48.710
Can I just say
I'm gladder!

14:48.710 --> 14:50.120
Can I just say
I'm the gladdest,

14:50.120 --> 14:52.540
because if we were,
I would have to stay here
with you,

14:52.540 --> 14:55.080
but instead, I get
to go home, and I get to watch
the horror movie marathon

14:55.080 --> 14:57.120
that I DVR'd.
I'm gonna watch The Purge,

14:57.120 --> 14:59.500
Insidious, Saw,
Silence of the Lambs--
(gasps)

14:59.500 --> 15:02.250
Silence of the Lambs,
oh my god, the fat girl's
stuck in the well,

15:02.250 --> 15:03.620
and she puts the bone
in the basket,

15:03.620 --> 15:06.040
and the dog jumps in,
we gotta get a bone,
and I'll be right back!

15:21.620 --> 15:23.170
(pop)

15:29.170 --> 15:30.420
(door slamming)

15:30.420 --> 15:33.040
-Aaah!
-What the hell?

15:33.040 --> 15:36.040
Oh my god!
How amazing was that?

15:36.040 --> 15:37.670
How amazing was what?

15:37.670 --> 15:39.620
Yeah, fool, what're you
talkin' about?

15:39.620 --> 15:41.670
Very funny, guuuys!

15:41.670 --> 15:45.170
Beyonce! At the club toniiight!

15:46.330 --> 15:49.620
Oh my god! Look at the time!

15:49.620 --> 15:51.290
Two-thirty?

15:51.290 --> 15:53.750
Oh my damn,
we missed the whole thing!

15:53.750 --> 15:56.330
Are you kidding me?
We just got back!

15:56.330 --> 15:59.250
Do you seriously
not remember anything
that happened tonight?

15:59.250 --> 16:02.080
The last thing
I remember was you yelling
"chug, chug, chug,"

16:02.080 --> 16:05.960
while I drank vodka
from a salad bowl.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.250
Yeah, right before
our limo showed up.

16:08.250 --> 16:09.540
Limo?

16:09.540 --> 16:13.330
So... we went to the show?
I don't remember any of this.

16:13.330 --> 16:16.420
Well... Beyonce
will remember you.

16:16.420 --> 16:21.830
Backstage, you taught Blue
how to sing Single Ladies
in Spanish.

16:21.830 --> 16:24.170
Todas las chicas solteras?

16:25.750 --> 16:28.620
Then you and Beyonce
stood by a mirror
and laughed...

16:28.620 --> 16:31.170
because she said you two
could be sisters!

16:31.170 --> 16:34.040
Now that you mention it...
this is all comin' back to me!

16:34.040 --> 16:35.790
Ha!

16:35.790 --> 16:39.330
Finally! It was
the greatest night ever!

16:39.330 --> 16:41.250
Yes, it was!

16:41.250 --> 16:43.580
Oh my god!
I just remembered.

16:43.580 --> 16:45.880
I made out
with Beyonce's bodyguard!

16:45.880 --> 16:47.080
(Elliot laughing)

16:47.080 --> 16:49.790
-That makes two of us!
-(all laughing)

16:49.790 --> 16:53.120
-We partied with Beyonce!
-(all laughing)

16:53.120 --> 16:55.830
The PR god really came through
for you guys!

16:55.830 --> 16:57.120
(both laughing)

16:57.120 --> 16:59.830
I'm gonna get going!
Chant me out.

16:59.830 --> 17:05.960
Both:
Elliot! Elliot!
Elliot! Elliot!

17:07.000 --> 17:09.290
God, the nothings
are stupid.

17:14.040 --> 17:16.040
Oh my god...
I feel a tug!

17:16.040 --> 17:17.170
I think I got her!

17:17.170 --> 17:20.750
-Okay! Just go slow!
Go slow!
-Okay.

17:20.750 --> 17:23.080
(doorbell rings)
Go fast ! Go fast!

17:26.750 --> 17:30.580
(gasps)
Oh my god, Kiki,
you're alive!

17:30.580 --> 17:33.170
Wait a minute. All that
and you don't even
have the ball?

17:36.290 --> 17:38.170
Natasha, hey,
how's your editor doing?

17:38.170 --> 17:42.880
Oh, she's gonna be fine.
You know, I didn't realize
how much I truly cared about her

17:42.880 --> 17:46.250
until tonight?
I mean, she's not
just my editor.

17:46.250 --> 17:49.040
-She's my best friend.
-Mm.

17:49.040 --> 17:51.540
TMZ ate that up!

17:51.540 --> 17:53.620
Oh, there's my baby!

17:53.620 --> 17:55.250
I hope she wasn't
too much trouble.

17:55.250 --> 17:57.830
No, she just...
played a lotta fetch.

17:57.830 --> 18:01.580
Ha! Yeah, she really
flies after those balls!

18:01.580 --> 18:05.170
Anyway... my people
will be in touch
about the project

18:05.170 --> 18:06.250
and the book.

18:06.250 --> 18:07.920
-Sounds good.
-Looking forward to it.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.540
And please feel free
to reach out to me
if you have any questions.

18:10.540 --> 18:13.250
Well, I do have
just one--

18:13.250 --> 18:15.170
why does my little girl
have a dick?

18:17.250 --> 18:20.120
Uhhh...
well, that's
a good question.

18:20.120 --> 18:22.790
Uh, first off,
are you sure that he has--
oh, now I see it.

18:24.250 --> 18:27.000
Where is Kiki Cook Campbell?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.710
Uh--
(barking)

18:28.710 --> 18:30.880
Okay, Natasha,
here's the thing.

18:30.880 --> 18:34.120
When we were on the phone,
we were-- we were playing
on the balcony,

18:34.120 --> 18:37.080
and then-- and then Gabi
threw the ball, and then
Kiki jumped and she fell--

18:37.080 --> 18:39.250
In love!

18:39.250 --> 18:41.040
Kiki?

18:41.040 --> 18:42.330
Yep!

18:44.120 --> 18:46.290
That's her.
Here ya go.

18:46.290 --> 18:49.500
This is so confusing.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.790
Well, you know,
with-- with all this talk
about "Get Laid" chicken,

18:52.790 --> 18:55.170
I looked at Kiki,
saw she was alone,

18:55.170 --> 18:57.380
and thought as a fun,
sexy story,

18:57.380 --> 19:02.000
for... our book,
um, I could find her
a boyfriend, and I did!

19:02.000 --> 19:04.290
Hence the... dick.

19:04.290 --> 19:07.080
Um... (laughs)
So meet... Wagon.

19:08.120 --> 19:10.170
Why is he wearing
her collar?

19:10.170 --> 19:13.120
Oh! We-- We just wanted Wagon
to get used to Kiki's scent.

19:13.120 --> 19:15.080
You know... pheromones.

19:15.080 --> 19:17.960
Oh, and look at that,
he loves her already.

19:17.960 --> 19:21.920
Adorable!
You two seem great together.

19:21.920 --> 19:23.120
-Wait-- Us?
-Are you insane?

19:23.120 --> 19:25.120
Not you, the dogs!

19:25.120 --> 19:26.080
(elevator dings)

19:26.080 --> 19:28.170
I'll be in touch tomorrow
about the contract.

19:28.170 --> 19:31.620
If you'll excuse me,
I have a doggie wedding
to plan and cater.

19:31.620 --> 19:34.170
Third time's the charm.

19:36.790 --> 19:37.790
Bye!

19:39.290 --> 19:42.790
Oh my god!
I can't believe
we pulled that off!

19:42.790 --> 19:46.120
Kiki must've also
landed on the awning,
slid off, and then, somehow,

19:46.120 --> 19:47.080
made her way up the stairwell.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.880
Who cares!

19:48.880 --> 19:51.920
My god, you got the deal
with Natasha freakin' Cook
Campbell.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.710
So did you.

19:53.710 --> 19:56.120
You know, it's too bad
we're not in a relationship.

19:56.120 --> 19:59.250
We work well together.
We'd be a pretty good team.

19:59.250 --> 20:03.670
Yeah, but then...
someone would do something
to make the other one mad.

20:03.670 --> 20:07.080
What could you possibly do
to make me any more mad
than what you did tonight?

20:08.880 --> 20:10.750
I got her hair!

20:14.120 --> 20:15.170
And then get this...

20:15.170 --> 20:19.080
Beyonce calls me onstage
to sing with her!

20:19.080 --> 20:20.540
Oh my god,
you sang with Beyonce?

20:20.540 --> 20:22.120
Sang! With Yonce!

20:22.120 --> 20:25.830
Wow. Well, you are not
the only one who had
a crazy night.

20:25.830 --> 20:29.120
Natasha Cook Campbell's dog
flew off Josh's terrace twice

20:29.120 --> 20:31.830
and lived, and I still
got a cookbook deal
out of it!

20:31.830 --> 20:35.960
Okay, Gabi, now it just
sounds like you're making stuff
up to top my story.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.580
(knock on door)

20:37.580 --> 20:39.880
Am I? Or is that
Natasha Cook Campbell

20:39.880 --> 20:42.750
bringing over the contracts
for our book deal,
ah, right now.

20:44.330 --> 20:47.380
Hi, Natasha Cook Campbell.
Hi, Kiki Cook Campbell.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.120
This is, uh, Sofia,
my roommate.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.380
Hi, Natasha.

20:50.380 --> 20:53.330
Latina roommate,
small enclosed spaces.

20:53.330 --> 20:55.580
(shudders)
Prison flashback.

20:57.420 --> 20:59.250
Well, shall we make this
official?

20:59.250 --> 21:01.460
Looks like
you could use
the money.

21:01.460 --> 21:04.080
Well, where do I sign?

21:04.080 --> 21:05.290
(barks)

21:05.290 --> 21:06.330
Oh? Looks like

21:06.330 --> 21:07.540
I'm not the only one

21:07.540 --> 21:08.670
who's excited.

21:08.670 --> 21:09.750
You'd think Kiki'd be tired

21:09.750 --> 21:10.790
after playin' all that fetch.

21:10.790 --> 21:13.040
Aww... Kiki...

21:13.040 --> 21:15.080
You like to play fetch?

21:15.080 --> 21:17.170
Okay... go get it!

21:19.750 --> 21:21.250
-(gasps, screams)
-(car horn)

21:21.250 --> 21:22.670
Oh my god!

21:22.670 --> 21:25.040
(gasps) Nooooo!
